00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:39,915
in a special place
last night.

00:08:39,915 --> 00:08:41,616
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
This chick's dead.

00:08:41,616 --> 00:08:43,618
"Whoa-whoa-whoa."
Yeah, she's dead.

00:08:43,618 --> 00:08:44,953
She was murdered.

00:08:44,953 --> 00:08:46,721
And the body
was found in a limo.

00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:49,958
And in that limo,
we found your bass guitar pick.

00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,794
Now that puts you
at the scene of the crime.

00:08:52,794 --> 00:08:56,731
Also in the limo was another
young girl named Tangerine.

00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:59,401
She's missing.

00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:01,536
I would advise you, Gene,
to come clean.

00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:03,405
Hey, man, I've never
been cleaner, okay?

00:09:03,405 --> 00:09:04,940
I'm gonna lay out
what I think happened.

00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,777
You and the Kiss band
played a secret gig last night.

00:09:08,777 --> 00:09:10,946
Played for, like,
some prince from Dubai,

00:09:10,946 --> 00:09:12,514
some Russian gangster.

00:09:12,514 --> 00:09:15,217
So, in the after-party,
some women are involved,

00:09:15,217 --> 00:09:16,751
things get out of hand,
everyone's wasted...

00:09:16,751 --> 00:09:18,620
Whoa-whoa. Brother,
have you got this wrong.

00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,524
Okay, first thing: I don't
drink, I don't do drugs.

00:09:22,524 --> 00:09:23,692
High people bore me.

00:09:23,692 --> 00:09:25,227
Another thing is,

00:09:25,227 --> 00:09:27,262
I sign ta-tas every day.

00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:29,264
That's my job.
That's what I do!

00:09:29,264 --> 00:09:30,465
I'm a rock star!

00:09:30,465 --> 00:09:31,600
And another thing is,

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,335
the Kiss boys and I

00:09:33,335 --> 00:09:34,870
didn't have any kind of
secret gig last night.

00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,872
Okay. How do you
explain this then?

00:09:36,872 --> 00:09:39,841
Your rock and roll
party bus.

00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:42,177
Simple: it's not real!

00:09:42,177 --> 00:09:44,412
It's all part of a
package you can buy.

00:09:44,412 --> 00:09:46,548
Look, it's called
"The Fame Experience."

00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:48,350
You know, a bunch
of guys get together,

00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,253
they pay heavenly sums
to feel famous

00:09:51,253 --> 00:09:54,322

with a rock god like me!

00:09:55,557 --> 00:09:57,726
Okay, so, this gig,
it wasn't real.

00:09:57,726 --> 00:10:00,228
It was, uh, like,
theatrical and make-believe?

00:10:00,228 --> 00:10:01,630
That's right.
That's what I'm saying.

00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,266

rocked out with last night

00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:05,700

my Kiss brethren.

00:16:58,513 --> 00:17:00,415
(sighs)
Okay, so, like, last night,

00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,683
Lex was on top of the world,
you know.

00:17:01,683 --> 00:17:02,850
It wasn't just chicks.

00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,319
I mean,

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,687
the first night we got here,

00:17:05,687 --> 00:17:07,355
he came in,
he went in the studio,

00:17:07,355 --> 00:17:08,723
he recorded one of his songs.

00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:10,425
And I guess some producer
heard it,

00:17:10,425 --> 00:17:12,627
and now a label's interested
in signing him.

00:17:12,627 --> 00:17:13,928
Really?

00:17:13,928 --> 00:17:15,930
A record contract?

00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:22,637
So this guy Lex Young--
he's our prime suspect?

00:17:22,637 --> 00:17:24,472
According to
his bandmates.

00:17:24,472 --> 00:17:25,473
And he's also

00:17:25,473 --> 00:17:27,508
been arrested twice for assault.

00:17:27,508 --> 00:17:29,344
But it looks like

00:17:29,344 --> 00:17:31,679
he really did have interest
from a record label.

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,381
A $1,000 deposit

00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:35,283
from Cogitator Music
International?

00:17:35,283 --> 00:17:36,884
I put a trap

00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:38,553
on Lex Young's
credit cards.

00:17:38,553 --> 00:17:41,255
No charges since he dropped
a grand on champagne

00:17:41,255 --> 00:17:43,658
at the Brimstone Club.

00:17:43,658 --> 00:17:44,926
So if our rock star's
on the run,

00:17:44,926 --> 00:17:46,427
he's not leaving any tracks.

00:17:46,427 --> 00:17:48,930
What about this missing person,
Tangerine?

00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,565
Well, no word
on her yet, either.

00:17:50,565 --> 00:17:52,800
And her killer did
a good job cleaning up,

00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,635
'cause Henry wasn't able

00:17:54,635 --> 00:17:57,271
to develop any DNA profiles
from the crime scene.

00:17:57,271 --> 00:17:58,806
Now, Nick and Sara
are pretty sure

00:17:58,806 --> 00:18:00,475
that that blood event

00:18:00,475 --> 00:18:02,810
is consistent
with Marcy Cody's injuries.

00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:03,945
Okay.

00:18:03,945 --> 00:18:05,279
What about this one?

00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,614
Your guess is
as good as mine.

00:18:06,614 --> 00:18:09,283
I've seen a lot
of weird blood patterns,

00:18:09,283 --> 00:18:11,319
but I have no idea
what's going on there.

00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:13,454
Okay.
(sharp banging)

00:18:13,454 --> 00:18:15,523
What is that, ballistics?

00:18:15,523 --> 00:18:17,425
(sharp banging continues)

00:18:17,425 --> 00:18:20,395
Actually, that sounds like
it was coming from the garage.

00:18:20,395 --> 00:18:22,630
(sharp banging continues
rhythmically)

00:18:29,704 --> 00:18:31,339
RUSSELL: Whoa!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:32,840
Dude!

00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,509
(chuckles):
What are you doing, man?

00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:35,510
(laughs):
Hi.

00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,578
Sorry about the mess.

00:18:37,578 --> 00:18:41,449
We can blame it on my insomnia
and late-night TV marathons.

00:18:41,449 --> 00:18:43,751
Have you ever seen
the documentary on The Who

00:18:43,751 --> 00:18:46,187
where Keith Moon hits the drum
and it looks like

00:18:46,187 --> 00:18:47,488
glitter comes jumping
off of it?

00:18:47,488 --> 00:18:48,756
No.

00:18:48,756 --> 00:18:50,558
In that documentary,
they pour water

00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:52,894
into his drum kit,
and then during the solo,

00:18:52,894 --> 00:18:55,630
they light up the spray as it
just leaps up off the drum.

00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,265
So, I think, I hope,

00:18:57,265 --> 00:18:59,333
I'm duplicating
the blood pattern

00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,536
from the crime scene.
What do you think?

00:19:05,807 --> 00:19:07,341
I'll be damned.

00:19:07,341 --> 00:19:09,243
All right,
back up, though.

00:19:09,243 --> 00:19:11,412
How do you figure the blood got
on that drum in the first place?

00:19:11,412 --> 00:19:12,647
From Lex Young.

00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:14,182
I think the combination
of the alcohol,

00:19:14,182 --> 00:19:15,383
the cocaine, the pills,

00:19:15,383 --> 00:19:16,818
him thinking he has
a music deal,

00:19:16,818 --> 00:19:18,653
put that in combination
with the adrenaline

00:19:18,653 --> 00:19:20,221
of being onstage,

00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:22,690
he thought at some point
that he was a rock god.

00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,625
<i>Rock goddesses were gonna fall</i>
<i>from the sky.</i>

00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,327
No, thanks!

00:19:26,327 --> 00:19:27,762
<i>But when they weren't</i>
<i>in the mood,</i>

00:19:27,762 --> 00:19:28,963
<i>he got enraged.</i>

00:19:31,332 --> 00:19:32,533
Oh, my God!

00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:34,669
(screaming)

00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:36,604
<i>And then he just</i>
<i>went back to playing.</i>

00:19:36,604 --> 00:19:38,906
(yelling)

00:19:43,644 --> 00:19:45,446
But we still have
a lot of it left to do.

00:19:45,446 --> 00:19:48,382
We didn't find a bloody drum kit
at the crime scene.

00:19:48,382 --> 00:19:49,784
Any ideas?

00:19:49,784 --> 00:19:52,186
Well, we might find the drums

00:19:52,186 --> 00:19:54,522
in the same place
we find Tangerine.

00:19:54,522 --> 00:19:56,457
(glass clinking)

00:19:58,526 --> 00:19:59,927
(groans)
This place reeks.

00:19:59,927 --> 00:20:02,363
Really?
I hadn't noticed.

00:20:02,363 --> 00:20:03,731
(groans)

00:20:03,731 --> 00:20:05,500
Well, at least we're
in the right place.

00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,369
Driver said he found the
limo bus a block that way.

00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:11,439
The Fame Experience studio
is just around the corner.

00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:13,841
Definitely promising.

00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:21,849
Hey.

00:20:28,422 --> 00:20:30,725
It's a drumstick.

00:20:30,725 --> 00:20:31,759
With blood on it.

00:20:34,562 --> 00:20:35,930
BRODY:
You see that?

00:20:38,332 --> 00:20:39,433
Throw this over there?

00:20:39,433 --> 00:20:41,536
Yeah.

00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:46,874
(wheels squeaking)

00:20:51,445 --> 00:20:53,481
(sighs)

00:20:55,316 --> 00:20:56,551
(both groan)

00:20:56,551 --> 00:20:58,586
(coughing)

00:20:58,586 --> 00:21:00,721
BRODY:
Bloody drum

00:21:00,721 --> 00:21:01,789
and a very bad smell.

00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,163
That's Lex Young,
the drummer.

00:21:09,163 --> 00:21:10,798
So much for our prime suspect.

00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,435
The Fame Experience is becoming
more like "Hotel California."

00:21:14,435 --> 00:21:16,671
"You can check out
anytime you like,

00:21:16,671 --> 00:21:18,573
but you can never leave."

00:21:24,312 --> 00:21:25,913
Our drummer,
Mr. Lex Young,

00:21:25,913 --> 00:21:28,849
sustained at least eight
sharp-force injuries.

00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:32,253
Wounds are consistent
with the stiletto knife

00:21:32,253 --> 00:21:33,588
found at the crime scene.

00:21:33,588 --> 00:21:36,424
Henry processed the blood
on the drum?

00:21:36,424 --> 00:21:39,226
Yeah. It's definitely
Mr. Young's.

00:21:39,226 --> 00:21:42,396
Got a wallet, Doc.

00:21:42,396 --> 00:21:44,632
Phone too.

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,337
Looks like he made some friends
while he was in town.

00:21:51,272 --> 00:21:52,773
One friend in particular.

00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:58,446
Ooh, boy, that's Tangerine,
our missing girl.

00:21:58,446 --> 00:22:00,481
PHILLIPS: Maybe they made
a love connection.

00:22:00,481 --> 00:22:02,683
Although, if she was
a working girl,

00:22:02,683 --> 00:22:05,286
it was probably
one-sided.

00:22:05,286 --> 00:22:07,755
Torn up pieces of paper
in his wallet.

00:22:07,755 --> 00:22:09,657
Must've meant something to him.

00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,830
That looks like a lyric sheet,
handwritten.

00:22:17,632 --> 00:22:20,501
<i>"Long Road Home,</i>
a song by Lex Young."

00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:22,903
He scribbled
a dedication underneath.

00:22:22,903 --> 00:22:24,905
"For Tangerine."

00:22:24,905 --> 00:22:28,476
I doubt Mr. Young tore up
his own song.

00:22:28,476 --> 00:22:30,244
That's bad for him,
good for us.

00:22:30,244 --> 00:22:32,713
Yeah, 'cause if Tangerine
tore it up,

00:22:32,713 --> 00:22:34,448
that means she touched it.

00:22:34,448 --> 00:22:36,817
<i>Long Road Home</i> could be
a short road to finding her.

00:22:38,285 --> 00:22:48,229
♪ ♪

00:23:00,508 --> 00:23:01,909
(computer trills, beeps)

00:23:07,548 --> 00:23:10,284
So, we got an I.D.
on Tangerine.

00:23:10,284 --> 00:23:12,486
Surprise, surprise,
it's not her real name.

00:23:12,486 --> 00:23:14,288
RUSSELL:
Angela Glenn.

00:23:14,288 --> 00:23:16,791
Arrests for solicitation,
pandering

00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:18,359
and fraud.

00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:20,561
At first, we thought
she was our next victim.

00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:22,530
Turns out, she may have
been involved

00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,932
in the murders of Marcy Cody
and Lex Young.

00:23:24,932 --> 00:23:27,234
All right,
tell me what you got.

00:23:27,234 --> 00:23:29,303
Well, let's start with
Lex Young's phone

00:23:29,303 --> 00:23:32,406
and a series of photos
of him with Tangerine.

00:23:32,406 --> 00:23:35,409
And the time stamp says that
they first met six days ago.

00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:37,311
BRODY: When The Fame Experience
started.

00:23:37,311 --> 00:23:40,614
A dream come true, right?
Lex Young meets his muse.

00:23:40,614 --> 00:23:43,184
That night, he goes home
and writes and records

00:23:43,184 --> 00:23:45,286
a song dedicated to her.

00:23:45,286 --> 00:23:47,388
And then, poof, all of a sudden,
he's got a record deal.

00:23:47,388 --> 00:23:48,756
Yeah, what are the odds
of that happening?

00:23:48,756 --> 00:23:50,524
100-to-one
it's a scam.
Yeah.

00:23:50,524 --> 00:23:52,560
And we've got a lead on
who might be behind it.

00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,496
Couple of hours ago,
a check transaction cleared

00:23:55,496 --> 00:23:57,865
Lex Young's personal account.

00:23:57,865 --> 00:24:01,168
$50,000 written to
Cogitator Music International.

00:24:01,168 --> 00:24:04,939
Deposited by the owner himself,
one Alex Gradenko.

00:24:04,939 --> 00:24:07,775
I'm assuming you've checked up
on the label.

00:24:07,775 --> 00:24:09,910
Yeah, it's an offshore account
in Belize.

00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,579
Belize!

00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:13,781
Which brings us
to Lex Young's e-mail.

00:24:13,781 --> 00:24:16,317
He and Gradenko have been
communicating

00:24:16,317 --> 00:24:17,718
for the past four days.

00:24:17,718 --> 00:24:19,653
"Mr. Young,

00:24:19,653 --> 00:24:21,489
"your demo is incredible.

00:24:21,489 --> 00:24:23,724
"Excited to meet you
in person finally.

00:24:23,724 --> 00:24:26,827
"However, we have a problem
with our digital distribution

00:24:26,827 --> 00:24:29,597
"that has resulted
in unexpected costs.

00:24:29,597 --> 00:24:34,535
"We will need $50,000
to avoid any unwanted delay

00:24:34,535 --> 00:24:36,570
in the release
of your single."

00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,206
That sounds like your classic
Nigerian e-mail scam.

00:24:39,206 --> 00:24:41,375
You give us a little now, we'll
give you so much more later.

00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,777
You know that thousand dollars

00:24:42,777 --> 00:24:44,411
that Lex Young received
from Cogitator Music?

00:24:44,411 --> 00:24:46,447
Right. That was just
the come-on.

00:24:46,447 --> 00:24:48,282
Like a sweet young Tangerine

00:24:48,282 --> 00:24:50,484
fawning over an aging,
wannabe rock star.

00:24:50,484 --> 00:24:53,687
Okay, so how does
the con turn into murder?

00:24:53,687 --> 00:24:56,490
Well, I'm thinking that the torn
lyric sheet that we found

00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,626
says that Tangerine,
at some point,

00:24:58,626 --> 00:25:01,328
maybe lost her stomach
for the grift.

00:25:01,328 --> 00:25:03,397
And maybe even started
to feel for her mark.

00:25:03,397 --> 00:25:06,267
So, Lex Young realizes maybe
that he's being conned,

00:25:06,267 --> 00:25:08,235
so he confronts Gradenko

00:25:08,235 --> 00:25:09,603
back at the studio.

00:25:09,603 --> 00:25:11,405
Gradenko kills him
to cover up the scam.

00:25:11,405 --> 00:25:13,774
And Marcy Cody's just
collateral damage.

00:25:13,774 --> 00:25:15,843
Okay, what about, uh, Tangerine?
Her neighbors say

00:25:15,843 --> 00:25:17,378
she hasn't been around
for a couple days.

00:25:17,378 --> 00:25:18,913
So we have a broadcast out

00:25:18,913 --> 00:25:21,615
on her car and we're sitting
on her place.

00:25:21,615 --> 00:25:23,651
RUSSELL: If I were her,
I'd be in the wind.

00:25:23,651 --> 00:25:25,653
(phone chimes)
If I were
this guy Gradenko,

00:25:25,653 --> 00:25:27,254
I'd be in the wind, too.

00:25:27,254 --> 00:25:29,190
Uh, maybe not.

00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:34,528
I.S.P. trace we ran on
Gradenko's e-mails to Lex Young

00:25:34,528 --> 00:25:37,898
came back to Vegas,
not Belize.

00:25:37,898 --> 00:25:41,235
And to a "cat" we all know.

00:25:41,235 --> 00:25:43,204
BRASS:
<i>Marty "The Cat" Kirch.</i>

00:25:43,204 --> 00:25:44,371
Pleasure to meet you.

00:25:44,371 --> 00:25:45,840
Captain Jim Brass.
How are you?

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,309
Or maybe I should say...
(speaks Russian)

00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:50,544
Comrade Gradenko.

00:25:50,544 --> 00:25:51,712
Captain, I can explain this...

00:25:51,712 --> 00:25:53,480
No, no, no.

00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,549
No explanation necessary,
really. This, you know...

00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:57,518
You got a really nice
side business here.

00:25:57,518 --> 00:25:59,954
The company provides
a taste of fame.

00:25:59,954 --> 00:26:02,256
And you provide
to would-be rockers

00:26:02,256 --> 00:26:05,292
the dream of Alex Gradenko,
record producer, right?

00:26:05,292 --> 00:26:09,496
Some poor schmuck gets to
dream of being discovered

00:26:09,496 --> 00:26:11,265
and getting
a record deal

00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:12,766
and becoming famous;
it's kind of slick.

00:26:12,766 --> 00:26:15,769
Exactly. That's why
I invented Alexander Gradenko.

00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:17,905
The world's best
record producer, right?

00:26:17,905 --> 00:26:20,574
Just like you said,
it's like selling dreams.

00:26:20,574 --> 00:26:23,310
Yeah. It's called
fraud, Marty.

00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,279
I don't understand.
Well, you know,

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,947
Lex young understood;
he understood the reality

00:26:26,947 --> 00:26:28,582
that you had scammed
him for 50 grand.

00:26:28,582 --> 00:26:30,251
And now he's dead.

00:26:30,251 --> 00:26:32,286
Wait a minute.
I mean, you got it all wrong.

00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:34,321
Are you saying
that I killed Lex Young?
Did you?

00:26:34,321 --> 00:26:36,423
And what about Marcy Cody?
I mean, geez, that poor kid

00:26:36,423 --> 00:26:38,192
just got in
the way, I guess.

00:26:38,192 --> 00:26:39,960
That poor kid was like
a daughter to me.

00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,762
You know, we're gonna find
the other girl, Tangerine.

00:26:41,762 --> 00:26:43,931
We're gonna find her dead
or alive, and when we do,

00:26:43,931 --> 00:26:45,699
she's gonna have
a story to tell.

00:26:45,699 --> 00:26:47,301
Well, I sincerely hope
you do find her,

00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:49,403
because the story
that she's gonna tell you

00:26:49,403 --> 00:26:51,305
is that I didn't hire her.

00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:54,308
Lex Young hired her.

00:26:54,308 --> 00:26:55,643
Lex Young? Really?

00:26:55,643 --> 00:26:57,378
I thought you hired
all the groupies.

00:26:57,378 --> 00:27:01,382
Captain, when you're a client
and you go off the menu,

00:27:01,382 --> 00:27:03,217
I'm not gonna stop you.

00:27:03,217 --> 00:27:07,488
So if you're looking for
what happened to Lex and Marcy,

00:27:07,488 --> 00:27:10,457
maybe you need to look
at Tangerine

00:27:10,457 --> 00:27:12,826
and not me.
Why's that?

00:27:12,826 --> 00:27:15,496
Because he had that hooker
on his arm all weekend long.

00:27:15,496 --> 00:27:17,731
The last day of it,
they had this massive fight.

00:27:17,731 --> 00:27:19,166
That's why.
Oh, really?

00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:20,334
Do you know
what it was about?

00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:21,735
I have no idea.

00:27:21,735 --> 00:27:24,872
But to me...
it's always about money.

00:27:24,872 --> 00:27:27,241
Yeah.

00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:30,611
Well, for me,
it's always about the crime.

00:27:30,611 --> 00:27:32,680
And you're under arrest,
Marty, for fraud.

00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,948
For now.

00:27:33,948 --> 00:27:34,882
(laughs)

00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:40,287
So, do you believe his story?

00:27:40,287 --> 00:27:41,889
I don't believe a
thing that guy says.
Well, truth is,

00:27:41,889 --> 00:27:43,824
we didn't find
any evidence that put him

00:27:43,824 --> 00:27:45,893
in the room at the time
of the murders, so...

00:27:45,893 --> 00:27:47,695
And the only people
who were there that night

00:27:47,695 --> 00:27:49,196
are either dead, or in the wind,

00:27:49,196 --> 00:27:51,532
or dead.
Captain?

00:27:51,532 --> 00:27:53,500
You got a visitor.
He said that it's important.

00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,902
Oh, yeah?

00:27:54,902 --> 00:27:57,371
Actually, he says
he's important.

00:27:57,371 --> 00:27:58,906
Captain, permission to board?

00:27:58,906 --> 00:28:00,240
Permission granted,

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,542
Sailor.

00:28:01,542 --> 00:28:02,609
So you've met
Officer Mitchell?

00:28:02,609 --> 00:28:04,345
Yes, sir.

00:28:04,345 --> 00:28:06,380
That's CSI Russell.
This is Gene Simmons.

00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,414
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

00:28:07,414 --> 00:28:09,883
Hey.
Yeah, nice to meet you.

00:28:09,883 --> 00:28:11,652
Wife's a huge fan
of your, um...

00:28:11,652 --> 00:28:13,921
reality show.

00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:16,256
Oh. What about you?

00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:20,461
Uh, I'm more of a Nature Channel
kind of guy.

00:28:20,461 --> 00:28:22,796
Oh, nature's cool.
So, Gene,

00:28:22,796 --> 00:28:24,765
what brings you by?
You paying a parking ticket?

00:28:24,765 --> 00:28:26,767
I bring you treasure.

00:28:26,767 --> 00:28:29,303
But first, a little
DNA for your Q and A.
Oh.

00:28:29,303 --> 00:28:31,372
I watch a lot
of cop shows.

00:28:31,372 --> 00:28:35,275
Okay, so... so, what's, uh...
what's the story behind these?

00:28:35,275 --> 00:28:37,277
Well, here's the deal.

00:28:37,277 --> 00:28:39,680
See, this girl gets my
number the other night.

00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,349
And, uh, I'm a gent.

00:28:42,349 --> 00:28:44,251
I never say no.

00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:46,520
Lo and behold, the phone
goes off this morning,

00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,423
and it's her, and she says,
"Uh, hi. Do you remember me?"

00:28:49,423 --> 00:28:52,793
And I say, uh,
"Honestly, no."

00:28:52,793 --> 00:28:55,295
And she says, "How can you
forget a name like Tangerine?"

00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,901
Where is she now?

00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:02,503
Outside in my limo.

00:29:02,503 --> 00:29:04,271
Take her down.
I'll call you.

00:29:04,271 --> 00:29:05,739
Thank you very much, Gene.

00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:12,246
I'm always at the service
of law enforcement.

00:29:15,682 --> 00:29:18,318
She doesn't look like
she could do it.

00:29:18,318 --> 00:29:20,921
Then again, she did take
a swing at Gene Simmons.

00:29:20,921 --> 00:29:22,556
Well, that's not
a huge surprise.

00:29:22,556 --> 00:29:23,724
He dimed her out.

00:29:23,724 --> 00:29:25,626
Doesn't make her
a murderer.

00:29:25,626 --> 00:29:28,429
So your money's on,
what, Marty "The Cat"?

00:29:28,429 --> 00:29:29,830
I don't know.

00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,732
Do you really think
a falling out

00:29:31,732 --> 00:29:33,801
between a hooker
and a john could turn

00:29:33,801 --> 00:29:35,536
into such a brutal homicide?

00:29:35,536 --> 00:29:37,304
Committed by the hooker?

00:29:37,304 --> 00:29:40,574
This kid, what,
goes into a rage,

00:29:40,574 --> 00:29:42,576
wants to drum the john
out of this world?

00:29:42,576 --> 00:29:44,178
(phone chimes)
Oh, seen crazier things.

00:29:44,178 --> 00:29:45,179
True.

00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:47,281
We need a why, D.B.

00:29:47,281 --> 00:29:50,384
I think we just got it.

00:29:50,384 --> 00:29:52,519
Text from Henry.

00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:54,455
Okay.

00:29:56,423 --> 00:29:57,791
Been sitting here an hour.

00:29:57,791 --> 00:30:00,694
It's costing me money.
You wanted to talk?

00:30:00,694 --> 00:30:02,763
So, talk.
Or arrest me.

00:30:02,763 --> 00:30:04,765
Do something, so I can just
get the hell out of here.

00:30:04,765 --> 00:30:05,833
You're not going anywhere!

00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:06,834
You think you're here

00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:08,635
for solicitation?

00:30:08,635 --> 00:30:11,472
You're here for this,
and you're here for this.

00:30:11,472 --> 00:30:14,441
Now, we've done our homework;
we know your story.

00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:16,477
You had a single mom
who left you in foster care.

00:30:16,477 --> 00:30:17,878
You grew up as

00:30:17,878 --> 00:30:20,547
a ward of the state
in a state-fun facility.

00:30:20,547 --> 00:30:22,249
It's a tough place.

00:30:22,249 --> 00:30:24,418
I'd say you see people
really at their worst

00:30:24,418 --> 00:30:26,220
in places like that.

00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,556
You also grow up with
a propensity for violence.

00:30:29,556 --> 00:30:30,657
Would you
agree with me?

00:30:30,657 --> 00:30:31,725
RUSSELL:
Look, Tangerine,

00:30:31,725 --> 00:30:33,460
we ran your DNA.

00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,729
You may not share
Mr. Young's last name,

00:30:35,729 --> 00:30:39,633
but you do share
13 genetic markers with the guy.

00:30:41,869 --> 00:30:44,238
He's your father.

00:30:44,238 --> 00:30:45,906
RUSSELL: But then, you
knew that, didn't you?

00:30:45,906 --> 00:30:47,841
Guy hires you for a week.

00:30:47,841 --> 00:30:50,544
Somewhere down the line,
you realize

00:30:50,544 --> 00:30:51,945
that he's your father.

00:30:51,945 --> 00:30:53,780
BRASS: How'd you find
out the truth?

00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,449
So, you're in the hotel room
with Lex Young.

00:30:55,449 --> 00:30:56,717
He starts telling you a story

00:30:56,717 --> 00:30:58,852
how he came to Vegas,
he met a woman,

00:30:58,852 --> 00:31:01,655
he had an infant daughter, and
he abandoned that little girl?

00:31:01,655 --> 00:31:04,391
And somehow, you pieced together
that that little girl was you?

00:31:04,391 --> 00:31:06,326
I mean, we understand.

00:31:06,326 --> 00:31:08,495
Hell, a jury would understand.

00:31:08,495 --> 00:31:10,230
Of course you went
a little crazy

00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,498
when you found out the guy

00:31:11,498 --> 00:31:12,733
you were sleeping with
was your father.

00:31:12,733 --> 00:31:14,301
That's not what happened!

00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:15,469
Okay, look, we just want
to help you out here.

00:31:15,469 --> 00:31:18,172
I didn't sleep with my father.

00:31:18,172 --> 00:31:19,640
I didn't kill him.

00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,642
Or anyone.

00:31:21,642 --> 00:31:23,777
(scoffs)

00:31:23,777 --> 00:31:26,680
You people don't know...
anything.

00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,182
Well, then tell us
what we should know.

00:31:30,551 --> 00:31:32,786
Look, I thought he was just
some rich guy.

00:31:32,786 --> 00:31:35,522
Okay, he hired me
for the week, another date.

00:31:35,522 --> 00:31:36,757
Until it wasn't.

00:31:36,757 --> 00:31:38,292
Tangerine.

00:31:38,292 --> 00:31:40,694
That's a pretty name.
I like it.

00:31:40,694 --> 00:31:41,962
Do you want to know
how you got it?

00:31:41,962 --> 00:31:43,764
My mom told me
it was a nickname

00:31:43,764 --> 00:31:47,801
my dad gave me when I was
little, before he took off.

00:31:47,801 --> 00:31:48,802
I'm sorry about that.

00:31:48,802 --> 00:31:50,837
Hey, it's...

00:31:50,837 --> 00:31:51,872
it's not your fault.

00:31:51,872 --> 00:31:52,873
It is.

00:31:52,873 --> 00:31:54,274
(scoffs)
What?

00:31:54,274 --> 00:31:56,743
I came to Vegas
for you.

00:31:56,743 --> 00:31:59,513
There's no way
for me to make right

00:31:59,513 --> 00:32:02,416
what I did, but...
I want to try.

00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,519
What are you talking about?

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,853
I've never been
very good

00:32:06,853 --> 00:32:10,290
with words;
there's, um, only one way

00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,658
that I've been able
to express myself.

00:32:11,658 --> 00:32:13,493
What the hell is this?

00:32:13,493 --> 00:32:15,429
It's something
I wrote for you.

00:32:15,429 --> 00:32:17,164
It's a song.

00:32:17,164 --> 00:32:18,665
(paper ripping)

00:32:18,665 --> 00:32:19,833
When was this?

00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:21,301
Monday night.

00:32:21,301 --> 00:32:22,836
RUSSELL: Monday night?
Wait a minute.

00:32:22,836 --> 00:32:24,204
I don't...
I don't get this.

00:32:24,204 --> 00:32:25,739
Tuesday night,
the next night,

00:32:25,739 --> 00:32:28,175
you were seen leaving
the Brimstone Club

00:32:28,175 --> 00:32:30,611
with Marcy Cody
and your father,

00:32:30,611 --> 00:32:32,279
and you were
all friendly,

00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:34,815
and then one hour later,
they're both dead?

00:32:34,815 --> 00:32:36,350
I mean, help me
understand that.

00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,651
My dad came back to the club
that night.

00:32:37,651 --> 00:32:39,653
He apologized.

00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:41,321
I mean, my mom's dead.

00:32:41,321 --> 00:32:42,656
I didn't think I had anyone.

00:32:44,491 --> 00:32:45,726
It's something
I fantasized about

00:32:45,726 --> 00:32:47,261
since I was a little girl.

00:32:47,261 --> 00:32:49,429
You know,
my dad coming back to us.

00:32:49,429 --> 00:32:52,899
I never thought it would
take this long, but...

00:32:52,899 --> 00:32:55,302
He said he just wanted
the chance to play me the song.

00:32:56,703 --> 00:32:57,871
And that girl, Marcy,

00:32:57,871 --> 00:32:59,373
she just wanted to get
out of the club.

00:32:59,373 --> 00:33:00,674
So my dad got the keys

00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:03,610
to the limo,
and we went back to the studio.

00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,246
What happened then?

00:33:06,246 --> 00:33:07,281
My dad played me the song.

00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:10,284
It was nice.

00:33:11,618 --> 00:33:13,287
Said a producer was interested.

00:33:13,287 --> 00:33:14,554
He'd heard the demo

00:33:14,554 --> 00:33:16,423
and wanted my dad
to record another

00:33:16,423 --> 00:33:18,358
with backup vocals.

00:33:18,358 --> 00:33:20,761
My dad said someone was gonna
come by the studio later

00:33:20,761 --> 00:33:22,896
and help him out.

00:33:22,896 --> 00:33:25,299
I wished him luck,

00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:27,768
and I left.

00:33:29,503 --> 00:33:30,570
I swear...

00:33:32,372 --> 00:33:35,909
...my dad and Marcy were alive
when I walked out of there.

00:33:41,481 --> 00:33:43,917
(computer trilling)

00:33:43,917 --> 00:33:45,652
So, these are
the recordings

00:33:45,652 --> 00:33:48,188
from The Fame Experience
studio, huh?

00:33:48,188 --> 00:33:49,923
HODGES: Marty Kirch
turned them over.

00:33:49,923 --> 00:33:51,658
Must be some
great listening.

00:33:51,658 --> 00:33:54,227
(chuckles) I can load them
onto your iPod, if you like.

00:33:54,227 --> 00:33:55,495
No, thanks.

00:33:55,495 --> 00:33:57,564
The important
song is the one

00:33:57,564 --> 00:34:01,601
that was recorded at 3:12
the night of the murder.

00:34:01,601 --> 00:34:04,705

Mm-hmm.
And playing guitar.

00:34:08,308 --> 00:34:09,676
He put both of those
on the same track,

00:34:09,676 --> 00:34:11,511
track one.

00:34:11,511 --> 00:34:13,380
What about the
background vocals?

00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,649
His daughter said that another
vocalist was going to help.

00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:18,919
Well, it looks like there were
no other recordings. But...

00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:21,788
look at the waveform
on this one.

00:34:21,788 --> 00:34:23,690

the background noise.

Well, an omnidirectional
microphone

00:34:38,939 --> 00:34:41,875
can pick up a lot
of extraneous audio.

00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:46,446
So you're thinking that someone
<i>was</i> there recording vocals.

00:34:46,446 --> 00:34:47,881
Maybe our killer.

00:34:47,881 --> 00:34:49,683
And they erased
their track.

00:34:49,683 --> 00:34:52,319
But their vocals still
bled onto track one.

00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:54,521
(sighs) Well, I'm not sure
we have enough here

00:34:54,521 --> 00:34:56,456
to be able
to identify the voice.

00:34:56,456 --> 00:34:57,858
We've got the
microphone.

00:34:57,858 --> 00:35:01,628

That night onstage
singing backup.

00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,775
Your DNA's all over
that microphone.

00:35:48,775 --> 00:35:51,778
Respectfully-- a-and I don't
mean to tell you your job--

00:35:51,778 --> 00:35:54,815
but my DNA on that
microphone proves nothing.

00:35:54,815 --> 00:35:56,716
I-I was singing into that mic
all week long.

00:35:56,716 --> 00:35:59,386
I know.
You know how I know?

00:36:00,487 --> 00:36:03,790
Organi Chew Organic Gumballs.

00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:06,693

it was you.

This is the color
you like, right?

00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:11,798
I read your band's rider.
I know you're the gumball guy.

00:36:11,798 --> 00:36:15,368
Found quite a few particles
of it in that microphone.

00:36:15,368 --> 00:36:18,438
And since you know how to do
my job so well...

00:36:20,807 --> 00:36:22,509
I'm sure you know
what that is, right?

00:36:22,509 --> 00:36:24,511
Um...
It's a trace report.

00:36:24,511 --> 00:36:25,912
You know
what that tells me?

00:36:25,912 --> 00:36:29,216
That tells me that the gum
contains xylitol.

00:36:29,216 --> 00:36:32,185
You know what xylitol is?
It's an organic sweetener.

00:36:32,185 --> 00:36:33,854
It comes from corn.

00:36:33,854 --> 00:36:36,256
Which is really good for us.
It can tell us a whole lot.

00:36:36,256 --> 00:36:38,792
'Cause thanks to you,
you left a whole lot of it

And when measured

00:36:47,934 --> 00:36:51,238
it can give me
a very specific timeline.

00:36:51,238 --> 00:36:53,373
You think of this gum,

00:36:53,373 --> 00:36:57,344
when chewed, as a...
as a body decomposing.

00:36:57,344 --> 00:37:01,414
Oxygen dissipates, muscles
stiffen at a certain rate.

00:37:01,414 --> 00:37:04,451

the time of death.

put you at the crime scene

00:37:16,696 --> 00:37:19,466
during the time
of the murders, Arnold.

00:37:19,466 --> 00:37:21,668
So, here's what
I think happened.

00:37:21,668 --> 00:37:23,803
I think that
after Tangerine left,

00:37:23,803 --> 00:37:26,339
you waltzed in,
and Lex

00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:28,608
was all too happy,

00:37:28,608 --> 00:37:31,444
because he needed a little help
with the background vocals.

00:37:31,444 --> 00:37:32,479
Am I right?

00:37:34,614 --> 00:37:36,616
It's always background.
Yeah, yeah.

00:37:36,616 --> 00:37:37,651
How's that make you feel?

00:37:37,651 --> 00:37:38,752
Makes me really mad.

00:37:38,752 --> 00:37:40,620
Pisses you off, right?
Yeah.

00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,788
You get more and more mad

00:37:41,788 --> 00:37:43,423
with every passing verse.
Mm-hmm.

00:37:43,423 --> 00:37:45,325
And he's like, what, uh,
"Stop, do it again.

00:37:45,325 --> 00:37:47,594
This time,
with more feeling."
Bastard!

00:37:47,594 --> 00:37:49,329
He thought he was Phil Collins,
you know?

00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:51,231
But I was better than he was.

00:37:51,231 --> 00:37:54,434
I was the heart and soul
of Darwin's Monkey.

00:37:54,434 --> 00:37:56,503
But Lex always had
to call the shots--

00:37:56,503 --> 00:37:58,638
when we broke up, when we got

00:37:58,638 --> 00:38:00,507
back together,
even this whole...

00:38:00,507 --> 00:38:02,509
Fame Experience crap.

00:38:02,509 --> 00:38:05,178
I was sick of it, you know?
And I told him so!

You. You're my problem.

00:38:12,419 --> 00:38:13,753
You want to be front man?

00:38:13,753 --> 00:38:17,591

00:38:25,865 --> 00:38:27,300

00:38:36,343 --> 00:38:39,212
And afterwards, you dumped
her body in the limo and...

00:38:39,212 --> 00:38:42,349
disposed of Lex's body where
we wouldn't find it, right?

00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:45,285
It worked.

00:38:45,285 --> 00:38:48,254
For a while.

00:38:48,254 --> 00:38:51,291
I mean, you thought
Lex killed her and...

00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:52,359
ran off, right?

00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:54,494
But then...

00:38:54,494 --> 00:38:57,464
you found him.

00:38:57,464 --> 00:39:01,434
Even in death,
Lex makes me look like a chump.

00:39:03,903 --> 00:39:05,872
You ever been in a band, man?

00:39:08,174 --> 00:39:10,377
Thought you were good?

00:39:10,377 --> 00:39:12,512
Lex was right.

00:39:12,512 --> 00:39:15,849
The only time I was ever really
alive was when we were together.

00:39:16,916 --> 00:39:19,686
Playing.

00:39:19,686 --> 00:39:21,588
And I swear...

00:39:23,556 --> 00:39:24,758
...we were really good.

00:39:24,758 --> 00:39:27,494
Well, Arnold,

00:39:27,494 --> 00:39:30,463
unfortunately for you,

00:39:30,463 --> 00:39:32,265
the music has stopped.

00:39:34,334 --> 00:39:36,269
(sobbing softly)

00:39:46,212 --> 00:39:49,449
Angela, I need
to talk to you.

00:39:52,485 --> 00:39:56,456
Your dad reached out,
tried to make things right.

00:39:56,456 --> 00:39:58,491
(sniffles softly)

00:39:58,491 --> 00:40:02,429
I feel bad about
what happened to him.

00:40:02,429 --> 00:40:06,266
So, as a favor
to your father,

00:40:06,266 --> 00:40:08,935
or even
as a favor to me,

00:40:08,935 --> 00:40:11,404
you got
to stop the hustle.

00:40:11,404 --> 00:40:13,940
You got to ease out
of the street life.

00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:17,944
And do it now while
you're still young, because...

00:40:17,944 --> 00:40:20,513
it doesn't end pretty.

00:40:20,513 --> 00:40:23,216
You don't know me.

00:40:23,216 --> 00:40:26,252
I do.

00:40:27,854 --> 00:40:30,557
You know, I spent, um,

00:40:30,557 --> 00:40:34,828
a lot of my life being a cop
rather than being a dad.

00:40:34,828 --> 00:40:38,431
I made a mistake.

00:40:38,431 --> 00:40:41,668
And I don't want you
to make the same mistake.

00:40:41,668 --> 00:40:45,271
So, if you
get in a jam,

00:40:45,271 --> 00:40:48,441
you get in trouble,
you need some help,

00:40:48,441 --> 00:40:52,579
or even if you just want to have
a cup of coffee, you call me.

00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:55,515
Thanks.
Oh.

00:40:55,515 --> 00:40:57,317
This is from your dad.

00:41:00,286 --> 00:41:01,621
I listened to it.

00:41:01,621 --> 00:41:04,324
It's a...
it-it's a pretty good song.
