he puked himself to death.

left him to bleed out

He's been dead
less than an hour.

Hang on a
second.

You see something?

00:03:15,715 --> 00:03:18,586
Looks like some type

00:03:18,586 --> 00:03:19,855
Could have
fallen off the killer.

a cell phone.

00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:32,409

the victim's name
is Pete Corday.

00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:50,538
His camera app
was open.

00:03:50,538 --> 00:03:53,208
Some of these pictures
were time-stamped

00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,444

he was murdered.

Talked to the janitor

the "Closed for Cleaning" sign

00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,463

he must've cleaned up in here.

throat

put the sign on the door.

00:05:03,288 --> 00:05:04,490
Smart.
You know, he was

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,528
with this girl right
before he was murdered.

00:05:08,563 --> 00:05:10,333
I figure either
she was involved,

00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,902
or at the very least
she's a witness.

00:05:14,206 --> 00:05:15,375
Any idea who she is?

00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,444
No. Finlay's pulling
surveillance now.

00:05:17,444 --> 00:05:19,214
Seeing if we can
track her movements.

00:05:19,214 --> 00:05:20,816
I mean, maybe
somebody knows her.

00:05:20,816 --> 00:05:22,419
Well, that's
a Dempsey's bag.

00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:24,422
Judging by the size,
I would say jewelry or makeup.

00:05:24,422 --> 00:05:26,693
We could show her photo
to the store clerks.

00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,329
If she paid
with a credit card,

00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:29,931
we might be able
to get a name.

00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:30,899
BRODY: <i>Russell.</i>

00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:33,704
Yeah?
Got a lead on
our mystery girl.

00:05:33,704 --> 00:05:35,373
The credit card that
she used earlier today

00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:37,576
belongs to a guy
named John Nolan.

00:05:37,576 --> 00:05:39,847
Nolan. Why do I know that name?
He's the director

00:05:39,847 --> 00:05:41,417
of the crime lab
in San Diego.

00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:44,755
Right. She used his credit card
here in Vegas?

00:05:44,755 --> 00:05:46,291
Did he report it stolen?

00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,327
Not yet, but according
to Nolan's assistant,

00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:50,197
he's here in town
for a family wedding.

00:05:50,197 --> 00:05:52,434
Nick's talking to him now;
says he knows him.

00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:54,838
Nolan offered him a
job a few years ago.

00:05:56,741 --> 00:05:59,679
Hey, John...
(clears throat softly)

00:06:00,814 --> 00:06:02,651
sorry to drag you down here.

00:06:02,651 --> 00:06:04,687
I thought you were investigating
the murder of a young man.

00:06:04,687 --> 00:06:06,690
We are, and a
person of interest

00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,462
has been using your credit card.

00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:11,598
Do you recognize
that girl?

00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:14,203
Oh, my God.

00:06:14,203 --> 00:06:15,939
It's Cara.
Cara?

00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:17,908
She's my 13-year-old daughter.

00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:20,947
Do you, uh...

00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,649
do you know the victim,

00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:23,650
Pete Corday?

00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,588
No, I've never seen him before.
Who is he?

00:06:25,588 --> 00:06:26,555
23-year-old

00:06:26,555 --> 00:06:28,358
from Phoenix.

00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:30,294
He's got a couple
of misdemeanors

00:06:30,294 --> 00:06:31,730
for drug possession.

00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,702
Why would she be hanging out
with a guy like that?

00:06:34,702 --> 00:06:36,238
Where is she, Nick?

00:06:36,238 --> 00:06:37,406
Can I see her?

00:06:39,343 --> 00:06:40,812
(sighs)

00:06:40,812 --> 00:06:42,548
We don't know where she is.

00:06:42,548 --> 00:06:43,950
What?

00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,987
When's the last time
you saw her?

00:06:45,987 --> 00:06:48,591
Uh... at 10:00 this morning.

00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:50,361
She wanted to go
to the mall with Lexi.

00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:51,295
Lexi?

00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:52,631
Yeah, my oldest daughter.
She's 17.

00:06:52,631 --> 00:06:54,567
They don't get to see
each other very often.

00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:55,569
Why is that?

00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:57,939
Well, after the divorce,
Lexi wanted to live

00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:00,477
with her mother here in Vegas.
I was dead set against it.

00:07:00,477 --> 00:07:01,979
Tori, my ex.
She'd rather be

00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:03,916
a friend than a parent.

00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,652
Have you talked to
either one of them

00:07:05,652 --> 00:07:06,587
since this morning?

00:07:06,587 --> 00:07:09,424
No, I was at a lunch
with out-of-town guests.

00:07:09,424 --> 00:07:11,662
They didn't show up.
I texted them--
they never answered.

00:07:11,662 --> 00:07:13,665
Okay, what about
the ex-wife?

00:07:13,665 --> 00:07:15,701
Or family members?

00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,470
No one's heard from them.

00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,873
Give me their
phone numbers.

00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:21,377
We'll ping their cells,
we'll track them down.

00:07:21,377 --> 00:07:22,980
Of course.

00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,850
And I need a current
picture of Lexi.

00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:30,625
(wry chuckle)

00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,363
It's a picture that was taken
at the rehearsal dinner

00:07:33,363 --> 00:07:34,498
yesterday.

00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,607
I'm gonna find your girls.

00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:41,276
If anyone can, it's you.

00:07:43,913 --> 00:07:45,349
Hey, boss.
Yeah?

00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:47,586
What do you got for me, David?

00:07:48,554 --> 00:07:50,691
Hadrurus Arizonensis.

00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:51,926
Otherwise known as

00:07:51,926 --> 00:07:54,264
the giant desert
hairy scorpion.

00:07:54,264 --> 00:07:56,700
Nick found a piece of
the molted exoskeleton

00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,436
next to Pete Corday's
body in the restroom.

00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,674
You were able to trace it?
Unfortunately no.

00:08:00,674 --> 00:08:02,877
The giant desert
hairy scorpion

00:08:02,877 --> 00:08:04,847
is quite common in Nevada.

00:08:04,847 --> 00:08:06,816
You know, last spring
my cousin Karen

00:08:06,816 --> 00:08:09,021
went to go put on her
running shoes for her daily jog.

00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,724
Didn't know one was hiding
in there; it stung her big toe.

00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:12,826
Was she okay?

00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,029
Oh, yeah.
But the venom

00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:16,532
is no more harmful
than a bee sting.

00:08:16,532 --> 00:08:17,467
Ah.

00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:19,070
Hey, Doc.
Hey.
I just finished

00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,639
Pete Corday's
autopsy.

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,509
He died from
exsanguination

00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:24,612
due to massive
sharp-force trauma.
Can you

00:08:24,612 --> 00:08:26,682
tell us anything about our
killer from the wound?

00:08:26,682 --> 00:08:29,820
Depth and angle indicate
a right-handed individual

00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,694
with considerable strength,
in all likelihood male.

00:08:33,694 --> 00:08:35,463
That rules out
the Nolan sisters.

00:08:35,463 --> 00:08:37,499
Okay. So what do we know?

00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:39,703
Cara Nolan was
with Pete Corday

00:08:39,703 --> 00:08:41,673
right before he was killed.

00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:43,776
And now both she and her sister
are missing.

00:08:43,776 --> 00:08:44,978
You think

00:08:44,978 --> 00:08:46,715
Corday's killer
has the girls?

00:08:46,715 --> 00:08:48,451
If they saw his face,

00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:50,721
maybe he took them
to keep them quiet.

00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:53,992
And if that's the case,
we need to find them, fast.

00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,462
Hey.
Hey.

00:08:55,462 --> 00:08:56,964
Were you able to
pull up the footage

00:08:56,964 --> 00:08:58,033
from outside
the bathroom?

00:08:58,033 --> 00:08:59,569
Uh, that camera was
not working.

00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:00,937
Figures.
Yeah.

00:09:00,937 --> 00:09:02,741
So I retraced
the girls' steps.

00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:05,845
We know that they bought makeup
at Dempsey's at 12:53.

00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:09,050
'Cause that camera was working.
And look what I found.

00:09:09,618 --> 00:09:12,455
SIDLE:
Oh, that's our victim,
Pete Corday.

00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:13,791
Who's the other guy?

00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,761
Obviously, a close personal
friend of Lexi's.

00:09:15,761 --> 00:09:18,365
I'm putting him through
facial recognition right now.

00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:22,639
(beeping)

00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:29,350
SIDLE: He has a rap sheet.
Axel Vargas, age 25.

00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,886
FINLAY:
Drug possession, burglary...

00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:32,388
pandering?
He's a pimp?

00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:33,589
No, worse.
Look at that.

00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:35,460
Federal charge--
tried to take

00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,530
an underage girl into Mexico.

00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,433
That sounds like
sex trafficking.

00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:42,871
Maybe that's what he's
got planned for Lexi and Cara.

00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:45,342
What's that tattoo on his neck?

00:09:45,342 --> 00:09:46,978
Let me zoom in.

00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:50,818
A scorpion.

00:09:56,426 --> 00:09:58,831
Nice tattoo on your neck.

00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,433
You like scorpions?

00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:03,572
They're cool.
Keep any as pets?

00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:05,441
No. Why?

00:10:05,441 --> 00:10:07,778
We found a piece of a
scorpion exoskeleton

00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:09,949
on the body of
a murder victim.

00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:11,485
Your buddy, actually.

00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,120
Pete Corday.

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,857
We know you
were with him,

00:10:14,857 --> 00:10:17,494
Lexi and Cara Nolan
at the mall this afternoon.

00:10:17,494 --> 00:10:19,764
Now he's dead and
they're missing.

00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,036
It's got nothing
to do with me.

00:10:23,036 --> 00:10:25,840
You have a history of forcing
young girls into prostitution.

00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,678
You'd get top dollar
for Lexi and Cara,
so what happened?

00:10:28,678 --> 00:10:31,517
Did Pete decide he wanted to
keep the girls for himself?

00:10:31,517 --> 00:10:33,152
Or maybe he decided
he wanted a cut.

00:10:33,152 --> 00:10:35,022
I didn't kill Pete.
Where are the girls?

00:10:35,022 --> 00:10:38,661
I'm telling you, I don't know.

00:10:38,661 --> 00:10:40,965
I met Lexi a week ago
at a bar.

00:10:40,965 --> 00:10:43,769
She wanted me to meet her
at the mall today, so I went.

00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,505
We hooked up in a dressing room,
and I split.

00:10:45,505 --> 00:10:47,108
Where'd you go?
Work.

00:10:47,108 --> 00:10:48,577
I'm a bartender
at McCarthy's.

00:10:48,577 --> 00:10:50,480
Cops picked me up
in the middle of a shift, too,

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,749
and I missed a whole day's pay.

00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:52,884
I'm gonna need
to talk to your boss

00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:54,487
and verify when you showed up.

00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,395
Nick said Nolan's
putting on a brave face,

00:10:59,395 --> 00:11:00,764
but, obviously,
he's upset.

00:11:00,764 --> 00:11:02,433
Well, we've
both been there.

00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:03,834
Father's worst
nightmare.

00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:06,105
Our girls made it.
Hopefully, his will, too.

00:11:06,105 --> 00:11:08,742
Listen, I want the department
to do everything in its power--

00:11:08,742 --> 00:11:10,713
resources, personnel,
I don't care--

00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:13,584
whatever it takes to bring those
girls back and close this case.

00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:15,053
Absolutely.
Oh, and do
me a favor.

00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:16,589
John's a good guy.

00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:17,891
As a professional courtesy,

00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:19,894
let's give him access,
keep him up to date.

00:11:19,894 --> 00:11:21,129
Yeah, I'll make sure
everybody knows.

00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:22,832
Thanks.

00:11:23,968 --> 00:11:26,872
Any luck tracking down Lexi
and Cara's cell phones?

00:11:26,872 --> 00:11:29,142
Thankfully,
they're still transmitting.

00:11:29,142 --> 00:11:31,947
I've triangulated their location
to somewhere in North Las Vegas.

00:11:31,947 --> 00:11:33,617
All right. Can
you get any closer?

00:11:33,617 --> 00:11:34,951
I'm trying.

00:11:34,951 --> 00:11:37,089
(computer trilling and beeping)

00:11:39,425 --> 00:11:41,128
(beeping)

00:11:41,128 --> 00:11:45,502
There they are--
off the 215 near Sahara.

00:11:45,502 --> 00:11:46,671
Signals aren't moving.

00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:47,939
Could be where
the girls are being held.

00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:50,043
(sighs)
Or where their bodies
were dumped.

00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:53,749
I'll call for backup.

00:11:53,915 --> 00:11:55,852
(sirens blaring)

00:12:10,175 --> 00:12:11,577
(sighs)

00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:13,981
Big search area.

00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,554
Yeah, but their phones
are still transmitting.

00:12:17,554 --> 00:12:19,524
They should be
right around here.

00:12:29,873 --> 00:12:31,576
I got one.

00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:34,581
Screen's broken.

00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:38,620
Here.

00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,030
Their phones were tossed.

00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,102
(sighs)
Yeah, but I don't see
any bodies.

00:12:47,102 --> 00:12:48,470
It means the girls
could still be alive.

00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,206
(phone chirps)

00:12:50,206 --> 00:12:53,010
It opened up to a video.

00:12:53,144 --> 00:12:55,682
Looks like it was taken
inside a vehicle.

00:12:55,682 --> 00:12:58,453
(beep)

00:12:58,453 --> 00:12:59,988
LEXI (crying):
Where are you taking us?

00:13:01,859 --> 00:13:03,695
Please, just let us go.

00:13:04,963 --> 00:13:06,933
Shut up.

00:13:07,701 --> 00:13:09,737
My sister's only 13.
She's just a kid.

00:13:09,737 --> 00:13:12,108
You don't need both of us.
Just please, let her go!

00:13:12,108 --> 00:13:14,044
(tires screeching)
You stupid bitch!

00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,783
(whimpering)
Ooh.

00:13:16,783 --> 00:13:19,219
Give me the phone,
or I will slit her throat.

00:13:19,219 --> 00:13:21,624
Lexi!
(crying):
No!

00:13:22,658 --> 00:13:24,227
Lexi got her
captor on camera.

00:13:24,227 --> 00:13:27,900
Couldn't see much of his face,
but no scorpion tattoo.

00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,603
That wasn't Axel Vargas.

00:13:29,603 --> 00:13:32,107
Then who was it, and what
does he want with these girls?

00:13:43,725 --> 00:13:44,694
Nick!

00:13:44,694 --> 00:13:46,230
Nick? Just heard
the suspect was released.

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,200
What the hell's going on?

00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,603
Yeah, his alibi
checked out.

00:13:50,603 --> 00:13:53,107
But he was with Lexi and Cara
right before they disappeared.

00:13:53,107 --> 00:13:54,977
He has to be on the top
of the suspect list.

00:13:54,977 --> 00:13:56,213
Yeah, I just saw the video

00:13:56,213 --> 00:13:58,916
that Lexi shot in the
abductor's vehicle.

00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,621
It's not Axel Vargas
behind the wheel.

00:14:02,857 --> 00:14:05,227
Do-do you have any idea
who the guy was?

00:14:05,227 --> 00:14:08,632
Actually, I was hoping you
could help us out there, John.

00:14:08,632 --> 00:14:11,537
You've been running
that San Diego office
for a long time now.

00:14:11,537 --> 00:14:14,242
You must have made some
enemies along the way?

00:14:14,242 --> 00:14:15,844
Can you think
of anyone who...

00:14:15,844 --> 00:14:17,947
who might want to
snatch up your girls

00:14:17,947 --> 00:14:19,717
to hurt you
in some way?

00:14:19,717 --> 00:14:21,653
God, I don't know. I...

00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,991
A family member of someone
you recently put away.

00:14:23,991 --> 00:14:25,960
Or someone who was recently
released from prison?

00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,763
Something like that?

00:14:27,763 --> 00:14:29,199
We-we just brought down
a biker gang

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,135
that killed a
city supervisor.
That's good.

00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:32,804
Have your lab send
that file over

00:14:32,804 --> 00:14:34,073
right away, and
we'll look into it.

00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,577
In the meantime, I want
to take a look at that video.

00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:39,248
(sighs)
If this is about me,

00:14:39,248 --> 00:14:41,786
maybe I'll recognize the guy.

00:14:45,592 --> 00:14:47,662
LEXI (crying):
Where are you taking us?

00:14:47,662 --> 00:14:49,999
Please just let us go.

00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:52,069
My sister's only 13.
She's just a kid.

00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:54,239
You don't need both of us.
Just please, let her go!

00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:56,242
(tires screeching)
MAN:
You stupid bitch!

00:14:56,242 --> 00:15:00,182
Give me the phone,
or I will slit her throat.

00:15:00,182 --> 00:15:02,719
Lexi!
LEXI:
No!

00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:08,629
STOKES:
I'm sorry you had
to see that, John.

00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:11,667
Do you recognize him?

00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:13,603
No.

00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,744
What if they're dead already?

00:15:19,947 --> 00:15:21,650
I mean, he had a knife.
He's already

00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,986
killed one person today, right?

00:15:22,986 --> 00:15:25,656
You shouldn't even be
thinking like that.

00:15:25,656 --> 00:15:27,827
Not when there's a chance
they're still alive.

00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,663
We'll work it
till we find 'em.

00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:31,799
BRODY:
It looks like
Lexi was trying

00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,002
to send this clip
to somebody. She entered

00:15:33,002 --> 00:15:34,704
this phone number, but
it didn't go through.

00:15:34,704 --> 00:15:35,973
STOKES:
Well, it's a silent call
for help.

00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:37,141
Whose number is that?

00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:38,243
It's mine.

00:15:39,312 --> 00:15:41,782
She was trying to send it to me.

00:15:41,782 --> 00:15:44,086
You weren't in her
contact list?

00:15:44,086 --> 00:15:46,857
I guess not.

00:15:46,857 --> 00:15:49,595
Lexi and I haven't had much
of a relationship

00:15:49,595 --> 00:15:52,199
since she moved here
to live with her mother.

00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:53,835
Well, you were

00:15:53,835 --> 00:15:55,972
the first person
she thought of to reach out to

00:15:55,972 --> 00:15:57,307
when she was in trouble.

00:15:57,307 --> 00:16:00,179
That's got to
mean something.

00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:06,288
Okay, all right,
where are we?

00:16:06,288 --> 00:16:08,692
Did you find out anything
about the motorcycle gang

00:16:08,692 --> 00:16:10,695
that Nolan helped take down?

00:16:10,695 --> 00:16:12,565
Yeah. Most of them
are in prison.

00:16:12,565 --> 00:16:15,236
San Diego P.D. verified the
whereabouts of the others.

00:16:15,236 --> 00:16:18,809
Is there anyone else who might
have had a grudge against Nolan?

00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:20,812
Well, Nolan's lab
just cracked a series

00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,948
of Mexican cartel murders
along the border,

00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,952
but he hasn't received
any threats lately.

00:16:24,952 --> 00:16:26,822
No, I think if
somebody wanted to get

00:16:26,822 --> 00:16:29,660
back at him, why would they come
all the way here to Vegas?

00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,161
Right. All right,
all right, look,

00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:33,132
maybe this has absolutely
nothing to do with him.

00:16:33,132 --> 00:16:34,835
The guy's got

00:16:34,835 --> 00:16:36,804
two beautiful daughters, right?
They're young,

00:16:36,804 --> 00:16:39,208
they're attractive,
they're in the mall.

00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,679
The mall is like a hunting
ground for sexual predators.

00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,650
Maybe this was a...
a crime of opportunity.

00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,120
Well, I looked at all
the surveillance video

00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,789
from the mall.

00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:49,658
Cara and Lexi left
through the west doors,

00:16:49,658 --> 00:16:50,961
but they were alone.
Okay, but that

00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:54,031
doesn't mean that the kidnapper
wasn't already following
them, right?

00:16:54,031 --> 00:16:55,935
I mean, he could have been
laying in wait outside,

00:16:55,935 --> 00:16:57,671
and then forced them
into a car.

00:16:57,671 --> 00:16:58,806
Hey.

00:16:58,806 --> 00:17:00,977
I was looking through
Lexi's text messages,

00:17:00,977 --> 00:17:03,046
and I found something
interesting.

00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:05,150
Seems she has an admirer

00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,088
who likes to send her
pictures of his... genitals.

00:17:09,223 --> 00:17:11,193
I'll take your word for it.

00:17:11,193 --> 00:17:13,062
Well, she told the guy to
stop, the images kept coming.

00:17:13,062 --> 00:17:15,834
When she threatened to share
the pics with the cops,

00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:18,037
the perv wrote back,

00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,042
"You bitch, you're
just like your mother."

00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:22,077
FINLAY:
He knows

00:17:22,077 --> 00:17:23,078
Tori Nolan.

00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:24,314
Did you run the number?

00:17:24,314 --> 00:17:27,319
Yeah. Came back to a used car
salesman named Dennis Hayes.

00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,888
Let's bring him in.
Police are trying

00:17:28,888 --> 00:17:29,856
to track him down.

00:17:29,856 --> 00:17:32,627
In the meantime, Sara's gonna
talk with Tori Nolan.

00:17:34,163 --> 00:17:36,733
Please, let her go!
You stupid bitch!

00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:39,271
MAN:
Give me the phone,
or I will slit her throat.

00:17:39,271 --> 00:17:40,707
CARA:
Lexi!

00:17:40,707 --> 00:17:42,176
LEXI (crying):
No!

00:17:42,176 --> 00:17:43,912
Is that Dennis Hayes?

00:17:43,912 --> 00:17:45,248
I'm not sure.

00:17:45,248 --> 00:17:47,418
I-I've only met him
a couple of times.

00:17:47,418 --> 00:17:49,221
How do you know him?

00:17:49,221 --> 00:17:52,192
He was a friend
of my ex-boyfriend.

00:17:52,192 --> 00:17:54,162
Oh, my God.
Do you think he did this?

00:17:54,162 --> 00:17:55,631
Do you think he took my girls?

00:17:55,631 --> 00:17:56,766
That's what
we're trying to figure out.

00:17:56,766 --> 00:18:01,240
Mrs. Nolan, we found
some pretty graphic photos

00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,078
and texts that
Dennis sent to Lexi.

00:18:04,078 --> 00:18:06,315
What was the nature
of their relationship?

00:18:06,315 --> 00:18:08,352
She barely knew him.

00:18:08,352 --> 00:18:10,822
He came to our house
for a party once.

00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:18,735
Lexi wasn't feeling well,
and she went up to bed.

00:18:18,735 --> 00:18:22,340
I decided to go check on her
about a half an hour later, and

00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,812
she was passed out on the bed.

00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:31,055
And Dennis was on top of her
trying to take her clothes off.

00:18:31,055 --> 00:18:32,658
What did you do?
Well, I pulled him

00:18:32,658 --> 00:18:33,425
off of her, and I told him

00:18:33,425 --> 00:18:35,328
to get the hell out of my house.

00:18:35,328 --> 00:18:36,830
You called the police.

00:18:39,135 --> 00:18:41,004
No, I didn't.

00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:42,740
Why not?

00:18:44,143 --> 00:18:46,980
Because we had
been drinking.

00:18:49,017 --> 00:18:50,753
And taking E.

00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:57,964
Lexi wanted to try it, and...

00:18:57,964 --> 00:18:58,933
I let her.

00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:00,703
(chuckles)

00:19:00,703 --> 00:19:03,440
I didn't want the cops
to find out.

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,911
I didn't want them
to take her away from me.

00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,716
You didn't report
Dennis Hayes,

00:19:08,716 --> 00:19:11,887
and now, he may have abducted
both of your daughters.

00:19:12,755 --> 00:19:13,957
Do you have

00:19:13,957 --> 00:19:16,762
<i>any</i> idea
where he could have taken them?

00:19:17,863 --> 00:19:19,799
I wish I did.

00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,711
What the hell kind
of mother are you?

00:19:26,711 --> 00:19:27,712
Mr. Nolan...

00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:29,816
You brought that monster
into our daughter's life.

00:19:29,816 --> 00:19:31,352
And now he's taken her and Cara!

00:19:31,352 --> 00:19:33,021
I didn't know.
I should never
have let you

00:19:33,021 --> 00:19:34,056
have custody of Lexi.

00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:35,392
She didn't want
to live with you.

00:19:35,392 --> 00:19:37,161
Hey, your daughters are missing,
and this is not

00:19:37,161 --> 00:19:39,398
gonna help us find them.
Let's just focus on bringing

00:19:39,398 --> 00:19:41,235
Lexi and Cara home.

00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:43,705

00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:05,206
As a matter of
fact, I do.

00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:08,111
I've been analyzing the
video that Lexi took,

00:20:08,111 --> 00:20:10,114
and from the dashboard,
I can tell that

00:20:10,114 --> 00:20:11,983
the vehicle
they were abducted in was

00:20:11,983 --> 00:20:14,755
a 1986 Chevrolet Suburban.

00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,391
Does Dennis Hayes drive
one of those?

00:20:16,391 --> 00:20:18,494
No, but I mean,
he's a used car salesman.

00:20:18,494 --> 00:20:20,465

to all kinds of vehicles.

Ecchymosis.

blunt force trauma to the head.

Fresh cuts on the bottoms

00:28:17,031 --> 00:28:19,235
as the exoskeleton
that Nick found?
No.

00:28:19,235 --> 00:28:21,806
This wasn't
a giant hairy scorpion.

00:28:21,806 --> 00:28:24,376
The histopath report
identified chlorotoxin

00:28:24,376 --> 00:28:25,478
and maurotoxin,

00:28:25,478 --> 00:28:29,117
consistent with a
deathstalker scorpion.

00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:32,089
They common to Nevada?

00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:34,192
Indigenous to Israel.

00:28:34,192 --> 00:28:36,428
Well then how is she
stung by one of these?

00:28:36,428 --> 00:28:38,098
It had to be intentional.

00:28:38,098 --> 00:28:40,302
Some people keep them as
pets, which is crazy--

00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,472
deathstalkers are
highly aggressive.

00:28:43,607 --> 00:28:46,244
<i>When they sting their victims,</i>
<i>the venom rushes</i>

00:28:46,244 --> 00:28:49,149
<i>into the bloodstream,</i>
<i>causing increased heartbeat,</i>

00:28:49,149 --> 00:28:51,620
<i>blood pressure, and,</i>
<i>if enough venom is released,</i>

00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,790
<i>convulsions and death.</i>

00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,461
Well, now, Doc said
that Lexi Nolan died

00:28:56,461 --> 00:28:59,232
from blunt force trauma, right?
Yes, but I think

00:28:59,232 --> 00:29:01,636
the scorpion sting may have
contributed to her death.

00:29:01,636 --> 00:29:03,239
See, Lexi had cuts

00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:05,642
on the bottom of her feet.
If she tried to run,

00:29:05,642 --> 00:29:07,312
with that venom in her system,

00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:08,380
she wouldn't have
gotten very far.

00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,784
Allowing her killer
to catch up.

00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:13,155
So do we know if Dennis Hayes

00:29:13,155 --> 00:29:14,691
has a thing for scorpions?

00:29:14,691 --> 00:29:16,193
He's not our guy.

00:29:16,193 --> 00:29:19,298
Police tracked him down
to a motel in Nebraska.

00:29:19,298 --> 00:29:20,466
He's been there three days.

00:29:20,466 --> 00:29:23,104
So we know that
whoever killed Lexi Nolan

00:29:23,104 --> 00:29:26,209
had access to
a deathstalker scorpion.

00:29:26,209 --> 00:29:28,813
And if they're
not native to Nevada,

00:29:28,813 --> 00:29:30,817
then where'd the guy get one?

00:29:31,651 --> 00:29:34,589
Hey, turns out there are
seven places in Nevada

00:29:34,589 --> 00:29:36,425
that sell
deathstalker scorpions.

00:29:36,425 --> 00:29:38,462
Seven places too many,
if you ask me.

00:29:38,462 --> 00:29:40,131
I guess some people
get a kick out of

00:29:40,131 --> 00:29:41,500
owning something
that can kill you.

00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,470
Deathstalkers only live
two to six years,

00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,273
so I got a list of everyone

00:29:45,273 --> 00:29:47,510
who purchased one
from 2008

00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,279
to now.

00:29:50,281 --> 00:29:53,219
BRODY:
We cross-reference this
with everyone who drives

00:29:53,219 --> 00:29:55,156
a 1986 Chevrolet Suburban,

00:29:55,156 --> 00:29:56,825
and we might get our guy.

00:29:56,825 --> 00:29:59,162
Great minds think alike.

00:30:04,737 --> 00:30:06,073
Here--

00:30:06,073 --> 00:30:09,812
Kieran Clark.
528 Cactus Ridge Lane.

00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:32,715
LVPD.

00:30:33,284 --> 00:30:35,554
OFFICER:
Kieran Clark, LVPD.

00:30:36,856 --> 00:30:38,158
Clear inside.

00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,333
All clear.

00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:44,869
Nobody's here.

00:30:45,871 --> 00:30:48,208
That means no Cara.

00:30:53,716 --> 00:30:55,887
This is Clark's address,
but it doesn't look like

00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:57,890
he lives here.

00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:02,196
Terrariums.

00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:04,167
A lot of them.

00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:18,122
Oh! Oh, God.

00:31:21,494 --> 00:31:24,766
Guess he's not just
into scorpions.

00:31:30,643 --> 00:31:32,546
Hey, Morgan.

00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,815
Check this out.

00:31:34,815 --> 00:31:36,585
Stalker photos.

00:31:36,585 --> 00:31:38,789
Cara Nolan was only in town
for the past few days.

00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:41,627
What, has he been
stalking her the whole time?

00:31:47,503 --> 00:31:48,872
Wait a minute.

00:31:48,872 --> 00:31:50,441
That's somebody else.

00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,177
That's not Cara Nolan.

00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:53,212
Who is it, then?

00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:55,516
Another victim?
I don't know.

00:31:55,516 --> 00:31:58,487
But whoever she is...

00:31:58,487 --> 00:32:00,791
she's a dead ringer for Cara.

00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:28,202
I already heard.

00:32:29,404 --> 00:32:31,540
You didn't find Cara.

00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,809
No. Not yet.

00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:36,181
But we know who took her
and we know why.

00:32:36,181 --> 00:32:37,751
A guy named
Kieran Clark.

00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:40,455
There was a-a shrine
in that barn.

00:32:40,455 --> 00:32:41,723
It seems as though
the suspect

00:32:41,723 --> 00:32:43,593
has an obsession
with a young woman.

00:32:43,593 --> 00:32:45,430
We haven't identified her yet,

00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,667
but she looks
just like Cara.

00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:49,870
He took my two girls

00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,374
because Cara
reminded him of someone?

00:32:52,374 --> 00:32:54,310
That's what it
looks like, yeah.

00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,380
But... only a
matter of time...

00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,616
Before we get Cara back.

00:32:57,616 --> 00:32:59,752
Is that what you're gonna
try and sell me?

00:32:59,752 --> 00:33:03,224
John, I'm not trying
to sell you on-on anything here,

00:33:03,224 --> 00:33:04,827
but I'm sure as hell
not ready to quit.

00:33:04,827 --> 00:33:06,698
We're gonna find her.

00:33:06,698 --> 00:33:09,368
No doubt we will.

00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:12,339
Just like we found...

00:33:12,339 --> 00:33:13,975
Lexi.

00:33:17,981 --> 00:33:21,353
I'm sorry about Lexi.

00:33:21,722 --> 00:33:25,260
But hey, you can't just fold
and throw in now. Come on.

00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,199
I'm no tourist, Nick.

00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:30,836
I've run a crime lab
for 17 years.

00:33:30,836 --> 00:33:33,707
Cara's been missing
for 24 hours,

00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:36,912
and that lunatic
already killed Lexi.

00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:42,655
You and I both know how
this thing's probably gonna end.

00:33:43,323 --> 00:33:45,961
I'm not about to quit.

00:33:45,961 --> 00:33:47,730
And you're not, either.

00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:50,634
(sighs)
You hear me?

00:33:50,634 --> 00:33:52,437
Hey, look at me.

00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:57,245
I will find her.

00:33:57,746 --> 00:33:59,849
Okay, what do we know
about Kieran Clark?

00:33:59,849 --> 00:34:01,318
He's known
as the Bug Guy.

00:34:01,318 --> 00:34:03,855
He goes around to schools
and kids' birthday parties,

00:34:03,855 --> 00:34:06,326
educating them
about insects and reptiles.

00:34:06,326 --> 00:34:08,730
It's terrifying
that he works around children.

00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,634
And the young woman
in these photos,

00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:12,403
the one he's
obviously obsessed with?

00:34:12,403 --> 00:34:13,772
SIDLE:
According to the police report,

00:34:13,772 --> 00:34:15,274
her name is Jennifer DeMarcus.

00:34:15,274 --> 00:34:16,743
She used to work
at a pet shop in Henderson.

00:34:16,743 --> 00:34:17,711
That's where they met.

00:34:17,711 --> 00:34:19,514
She had one date with Clark

00:34:19,514 --> 00:34:21,284
before she realized
he was a head case,

00:34:21,284 --> 00:34:22,786
and then she told him
that she wasn't interested.

00:34:22,786 --> 00:34:24,689
Let me guess-- he wouldn't
take no for an answer.

00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:26,358
SIDLE: He kept coming
around the pet shop,

00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:27,761
and then he started
parking his car

00:34:27,761 --> 00:34:29,597
in front of Jennifer's
apartment at night.

00:34:29,597 --> 00:34:31,700
She called the police
on him several times.

00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,236
Did she get a
restraining order?

00:34:33,236 --> 00:34:35,273
Left town.
Moved back to Georgia.

00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,743
Put as much distance between her
and Clark as she could.

00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,746
Clearly, he's still
obsessed with her.

00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:41,584
So, what do you think?

00:34:41,584 --> 00:34:43,420
Kieran goes to the mall,

00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,690
<i>sees Cara looking</i>
<i>very much like Jennifer,</i>

00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,025
<i>and he decides to grab her.</i>

00:34:47,025 --> 00:34:49,329
Except Cara
was with Pete Corday,

00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:51,700
so Clark had to get rid
of him first.

00:34:58,544 --> 00:35:01,883
And by the time he was done
with Pete, Cara was with Lexi,

00:35:01,883 --> 00:35:04,253
so he had to
take them both.
Right.

00:35:04,253 --> 00:35:05,421
The stone particles

00:35:05,421 --> 00:35:08,793
that Nick found in Lexi Nolan's
head wound were coated.

00:35:08,793 --> 00:35:12,700
I identified a mixture
of ethanol, alkylalkoxysilane

00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,370
and isopropyl acetate.

00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,638
Oxysilane?

00:35:15,638 --> 00:35:18,009
That sounds like
a sealant of some kind.

00:35:18,009 --> 00:35:20,012
Actually, it's an
impregnating sealant,

00:35:20,012 --> 00:35:22,850
used to protect concrete
from water and staining--

00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,654
uh, primarily
walkways, driveways.

00:35:25,654 --> 00:35:27,925
There was no evidence of
sealant in the Dumpster

00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:29,627
where Lexi's body was
found, which means

00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,599
it had to come from where
she was actually murdered.

00:35:33,066 --> 00:35:35,569
Lexi tried to escape.

00:35:35,569 --> 00:35:39,376
<i>She was still feeling distress</i>
<i>from the scorpion sting.</i>

00:35:39,376 --> 00:35:40,879
<i>Maybe she was near a driveway</i>

00:35:40,879 --> 00:35:43,683
<i>when Kieran Clark</i>
<i>caught up to her</i>

00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,419
<i>and smashed her head into it.</i>

00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:51,329
The sealant in
Lexi's wound

00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:54,067
wasn't entirely cured,
meaning that it was

00:35:54,067 --> 00:35:56,603
probably applied
within the last couple of days.

00:35:56,603 --> 00:35:57,605
Okay. All right.

00:35:57,605 --> 00:35:59,909
Let's do a search within
a five-mile radius

00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:01,545
of where Lexi's body
was found.

00:36:01,545 --> 00:36:03,381
We're looking for
somebody who recently

00:36:03,381 --> 00:36:05,785
had their concrete
driveway sealed.

00:36:10,093 --> 00:36:11,394
STOKES:
Hey.
Hey.

00:36:11,394 --> 00:36:12,496
I heard you
got something.

00:36:12,496 --> 00:36:14,366
Yeah. Lexi's body
was found right here.

00:36:16,335 --> 00:36:18,306
Two miles away,
on Harvard Drive,

00:36:18,306 --> 00:36:21,010
this house had their driveway
sealed on Wednesday.

00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,614
Now, we know that when Lexi ran
she didn't get very far,

00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:24,883
so Clark's got to be
holding Cara

00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:26,586
somewhere nearby.

00:36:26,586 --> 00:36:28,322
I should get out there.

00:36:28,322 --> 00:36:29,590
Wait for backup.

00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,327
I will.

00:36:37,937 --> 00:36:40,441
♪ ♪

00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:11,791
LVPD!

00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:12,860
KIERAN:
Get over here.

00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,396
Kieran Clark!

00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:16,432
CARA:
No! Let me go!

00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:19,938
Drop the knife.

00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,073
Don't come
any closer.

00:37:22,642 --> 00:37:23,978
Put the knife down.

00:37:25,948 --> 00:37:27,817
I'll slit her throat.

00:37:27,817 --> 00:37:30,555
Hey, me and you,
we can work this out.

00:37:30,555 --> 00:37:32,592
But you don't need to hurt her.

00:37:32,592 --> 00:37:35,530
What I need is
for you to leave.

00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:37,833
Now, we both know that's not
going to happen.

00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:39,603
Go!

00:37:40,872 --> 00:37:41,940
I will kill her.

00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:47,048
I know about the girl
from the pet store.

00:37:47,048 --> 00:37:48,784
Jennifer-- I mean, isn't that
the girl you liked?

00:37:48,784 --> 00:37:50,587
I love her.
Okay.

00:37:50,587 --> 00:37:52,657
All right.

00:37:52,657 --> 00:37:54,527
But she's not her.

00:37:54,527 --> 00:37:57,932
Her name is Cara Nolan.
She's 13 years old.

00:37:57,932 --> 00:37:58,867
She's never done anything
to hurt you.

00:37:58,867 --> 00:38:01,137
I know...

00:38:01,137 --> 00:38:03,808
when you saw her at the mall,
you thought...

00:38:03,808 --> 00:38:04,944
"That's Jennifer."

00:38:04,944 --> 00:38:06,547
(gasping)

00:38:06,547 --> 00:38:08,016
But take a closer look.

00:38:09,117 --> 00:38:10,886
It's not her.

00:38:10,886 --> 00:38:12,489
She's a child,
and she...

00:38:12,489 --> 00:38:13,958
she needs to go home.

00:38:16,996 --> 00:38:18,766
You're wrong.

00:38:18,766 --> 00:38:19,968
She's mine.

00:38:21,404 --> 00:38:24,676
Let her go.
I can't let you take her.

00:38:32,922 --> 00:38:34,792
It's okay.

00:38:34,792 --> 00:38:36,895
It's all right. I'm a
friend of your dad's.

00:38:36,895 --> 00:38:38,030
CARA:
Thank you.

00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,774
It's gonna be all right.

00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,495
(knock at door)

00:39:12,185 --> 00:39:14,455
How's she doing?

00:39:14,455 --> 00:39:16,058
Physically, she's okay.

00:39:16,058 --> 00:39:18,094
She's been through
a hell of an ordeal, but...

00:39:19,597 --> 00:39:21,567
...she's alive because of you.

00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,036
You never gave up.

00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:27,443
Thank you for
bringing her back to me.

00:39:27,443 --> 00:39:28,879
You're welcome.

00:39:30,481 --> 00:39:32,885
You know, Nick...

00:39:32,885 --> 00:39:36,858
I've been thinking
about the choices I've made.

00:39:36,858 --> 00:39:38,828
Working weekends and evenings.

00:39:38,828 --> 00:39:41,433
Missing school plays,
soccer games.

00:39:41,433 --> 00:39:43,769
Sometimes going days
without seeing my girls.

00:39:43,769 --> 00:39:45,439
For years, I've been putting
other people's families

00:39:45,439 --> 00:39:46,507
ahead of my own.

00:39:46,507 --> 00:39:47,675
I don't want to do that anymore.

00:39:49,144 --> 00:39:50,980
So, what are you saying?
You're gonna hang it up?

00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,452
Well, Cara needs me.

00:39:53,452 --> 00:39:55,492
Now more than ever.

00:39:55,492 --> 00:39:57,694
It would be a big loss
for your crime lab.

00:39:58,728 --> 00:40:00,163
Not with you there.

00:40:00,163 --> 00:40:03,133
John, we've talked about this.
I've already got a job.

00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:05,802
I'm not asking you
to just join the team.

00:40:05,802 --> 00:40:07,804
I'm asking you to run it.

00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:12,509
You want me to take over
the crime lab in San Diego?

00:40:12,509 --> 00:40:13,810
I know it would be
in good hands

00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,478
with you at the helm.

00:40:18,615 --> 00:40:20,550
(sighs)

00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,885
(stammering):
That's a big job.

00:40:21,885 --> 00:40:25,221
You don't have to answer me
right now.

00:40:25,221 --> 00:40:27,557
Just promise me...
you'll think about it.

00:40:33,396 --> 00:40:34,697
Thank you, Nick.
