(whimpering continues)

00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,017
You like what you see?

00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,987
That is genuine artwork
by the Blue Paint Killer,

00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:22,222
Keith Greer, collected
shortly before his arrest

00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,323
and suicide.

00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,093
Here, it's for only
a thousand bucks.

00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:28,662
Certificate of
authenticity included.

00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,031
Huh?

00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:33,433
Mm, I don't know.

00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:35,469
Think on it,
browse around.

00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,237
Plenty of deadly
cool stuff here.

00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:44,478
♪ ♪

00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:59,326
This letter is
personally autographed

00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:00,494
by the Strip Strangler.

00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,563
A truly fascinating
criminal.

00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,066
Throw in the crime scene photos,
we got a deal.

00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,302
MAN (over speakers):
Fellow collectors!

00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:11,171
Fellow collectors, it's time

00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:14,141
to unveil the item
you've all been awaiting.

00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:17,144
Bidding will start at $50,000.

00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:19,246
No serial killer
in the last 30 years

00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:23,517
has haunted Las Vegas quite like
the notorious Lucas Reem.

00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,552
This morning,
we offer you the chance

00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,654
to own the car driven by Reem

00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,290
in 1995, when he slaughtered

00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,727
ten souls over the course
of one summer.

00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,196
(crowd murmuring excitedly)

00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,465
Fellow collectors,
this is the chariot

00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:41,301
that carried Reem
through his rampage!

00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:47,174
(people gasping)

00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,011
Damon?

00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,413
That's fake, right?

00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,683
Call 911!

00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,151
That's rad, man!

00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,286
Call 911!

00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:01,455
Guess it's real.

00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,124
Even cooler.

00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:13,100
Victim's name
is Damon Harlow.

00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,135
He and his
business partner there

00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,671
started this interesting
little swap meet attracting

00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,407
"murderabilia" buffs
from across the region.

00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:21,975
Murderabilia.

00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,744
True crime collectibles.

00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:26,446
Artwork, autographs,
mementos.

00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,281
All from famous killers.

00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,716
Where'd they get all this crap?

00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,452
Some of it comes from
police property auctions,

00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,155
others are gifts from
incarcerated killers.

00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,391
As long as the convicts
aren't directly profiting,

00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,192
it's legal to
sell this stuff.

00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:44,197
Including the car
belonging to Lucas Reem.

00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:47,234
With our fresh kill here,
Damon Harlow.

00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,504
You know,
I remember that summer.

00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,407
I was 12 years old,
my parents were still together,

00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:54,541
we were living in Vegas.

00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:58,078
That monster was killing
a new girl every few weeks.

00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:00,547
I watched my mom triple-check
the locks every night.

00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:03,717
Yeah, it was a...
it was a big deal up north, too.

00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,388
Reem confessed
to all ten murders, right?

00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,724
Yet he still lingered
on death row for how long?

00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:11,758
20 years.

00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,027
Finally got the needle
a few months ago.

00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,563
And now these guys want to

00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,198
memorialize him.

00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:19,766
Keep his legacy alive.

00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,469
Yeah, it's a little disturbing.

00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:24,171
Roomful of people

00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:25,739
fixated on murder.

00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:31,178

about ten hours ago.

00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:19,809
So, midnight.

00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:22,612
We're looking at
approximately...

00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:24,547
a dozen stab wounds.

00:04:24,547 --> 00:04:27,317
Cast-off and spatter indicates
that he was killed in the car,

00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:28,685
not posed here after.

00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,454
Unusual blood pattern.

00:04:31,454 --> 00:04:34,057
Looks like something
brushed through the spatter.

00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,128
Special breed of lookie-loos
in this place.

00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:40,463
Nah, they're just figuring out

00:04:40,463 --> 00:04:44,300
how much the fresh carnage
increases the value of the car.

00:04:49,305 --> 00:04:51,207
You think I'm dealing in blood
money selling this stuff.

00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,409
I think the city of
Milwaukee got it right

00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:56,246
when they took all of
Jeffrey Dahmer's possessions,

00:04:56,246 --> 00:04:58,081
shoved them
into a landfill.

00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,782
Nothing like this
has ever happened.

00:04:59,782 --> 00:05:02,151
Damon and I put on these events
a few times a year.

00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:04,454
So when was the last time
you had contact with Damon?

00:05:04,454 --> 00:05:05,421
Yesterday.

00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:07,490
He called to say he wanted
to get the car ready.

00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,792
He didn't show up this morning,
didn't answer my calls.

00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:11,494
And yet you went right
ahead with the auction.

00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:14,330
Damon was troubled, okay?
Drinking, depression.

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,798
Either could take hold
of him for a few days.

00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:18,201
This car is
a huge sale.

00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:20,370
I had buyers here
from all over.
I understand.

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,472
Got to give them what
they came for, right?

00:05:23,473 --> 00:05:24,807
Let me ask you
one more thing.

00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:27,577
Did Damon have any
enemies you knew of?

00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,811
He had a temper.

00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:32,181
Got into it sometimes
with customers, other dealers,

00:05:32,181 --> 00:05:33,449
but it never got violent.

00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:36,719
Look, these collectors
are good people.

00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:39,188
Well, you'll forgive me if
I don't take my readings

00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:41,224
from your moral compass.

00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,373
50 grand for a car?

00:05:57,373 --> 00:06:00,076
You'd think they'd
at least wipe the dust off.

00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:03,746
These collectors want it
exactly as Lucas Reem left it.

00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:05,181
Although he didn't leave

00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:06,616
those fresh fingerprints

00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,551
there on the dashboard,
so I'm gonna run them.

00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:09,686
Memory card's full.

00:06:09,686 --> 00:06:11,788
I got to get
another camera.

00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:18,795
Hurry up.

00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:21,664
Hey, hey, hey!

00:06:21,664 --> 00:06:23,099
Get out of here.

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,234
Give me your I.D.s.

00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:26,269
Come on.

00:06:29,372 --> 00:06:30,206
I'll run them.

00:06:30,506 --> 00:06:31,541
The hell are you guys doing?

00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,675
Wanted to
take a look.

00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:34,377
Maybe get a selfie.

00:06:34,377 --> 00:06:36,079
We've just never seen
a real vic before.

00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,180
Yeah, well,
I've seen plenty,

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,581
and there's nothing fun
about it.

00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:40,717
What's that cop doing
with our licenses exactly?

00:06:40,717 --> 00:06:42,352
He's checking to see
if you're criminals.

00:06:42,685 --> 00:06:44,087
Or just idiots.

00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:45,555
I mean, Lucas Reem?

00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:47,323
Nate Haskell?

00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,460
How would you feel if it was
your loved ones they attacked?

00:06:51,794 --> 00:06:54,197
No records,
but I'll cuff them.

00:06:55,798 --> 00:06:58,167
Why don't we give them
a break, Mitch.

00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:01,437
As long as you guys promise to
find more respectable hobbies.

00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:03,306
Got to be something cooler
to do in...

00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:05,575
"Dead Owl Creek"?

00:07:09,212 --> 00:07:10,246
Get out of here.

00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,481
BRODY:
Greg.

00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:13,149
Come take
a look at this.

00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,653
The prints from
the dashboard come back

00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:20,656
to a casino worker
named Nora Waters.

00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:24,494
Her sister was one of Lucas
Reem's victims back in '95.

00:07:25,094 --> 00:07:26,429
SANDERS:
So what do we think?

00:07:26,429 --> 00:07:28,297
Nora came here?

00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:31,768
To the place where her sister's
killer is being celebrated?

00:07:32,402 --> 00:07:34,437
Maybe to put an end
to this whole circus.

00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,842
SIDLE: Your fingerprints say
that you were in that car.

00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:42,712
Nora, we need to know what
you were doing in there.

00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:48,251
All right, um...

00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,621
Look, I know about your family's
history with Lucas Reem.

00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:52,688
Our history?

00:07:52,688 --> 00:07:56,426
You mean how Lucas Reem
butchered my sister?

00:07:57,593 --> 00:07:59,262
Sorry to bring
you back there.

00:07:59,262 --> 00:08:00,663
Seven years old, seeing that.

00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:03,399
Home alone with your big sister
when that man slips in

00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,236
through the window,
comes creeping down the hall.

00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,539
(panting)

00:08:09,672 --> 00:08:11,107
<i>Rachel helped me hide</i>
<i>in the closet.</i>

00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:13,676
Nora, I need you to stay
in here, okay? Do not move.

00:08:13,676 --> 00:08:15,745
Please don't leave me,
Rachel, please.

00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,313
Sorry.

00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,586
(screams)

00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:26,622
(screaming)

00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:28,324
Stop!

00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,726
(sobbing, screaming)

00:08:35,298 --> 00:08:37,533
<i>Lucas Reem had no idea</i>
<i>I was there.</i>

00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:41,270
Inches away while he...

00:08:42,672 --> 00:08:43,806
hurt her.

00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,610
That's something that no one
should have to go through.

00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,548
I can only imagine how
angry you must have felt

00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:54,550
about Reem's car
being auctioned off.

00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,153
You think that
I killed Damon?

00:08:57,153 --> 00:08:57,687
Damon?

00:08:57,687 --> 00:08:59,322
Wait, you knew
the victim?

00:08:59,322 --> 00:09:00,223
Knew him?

00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:02,125
I loved him.

00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,459
I don't understand.

00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,496
Damon and I were dating
for the past year.

00:09:06,496 --> 00:09:09,665
I heard about him online,
what he did for a living.

00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:12,401
"Murderabilia."

00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:14,237
I sent him
this awful e-mail,

00:09:14,237 --> 00:09:17,473
telling him he should be ashamed
of himself, if not locked up.

00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,611
And then he took me to coffee.

00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:26,182
And he told me everything
that he'd studied

00:09:26,182 --> 00:09:27,717
about Lucas Reem
and other serials.

00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:30,219
The history,
the psychology.

00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:31,687
Damon was a student,

00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:35,091
exploring the darkest parts
of humanity.

00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:38,127
Selling off some artifacts
helped him support his studies.

00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,598
When exactly were you in the
car at the convention site?

00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:43,699
Yesterday morning.

00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:45,234
Damon was getting
the car ready.

00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:49,705
I sat in it with him,
feeling its strange energy.

00:09:49,705 --> 00:09:51,574
And I felt safe.

00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:54,477
Because Damon was with me.

00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,680
I have to ask.

00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:00,750
Where were you last
night at midnight?

00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,718
In bed.

00:10:02,718 --> 00:10:04,320
I couldn't sleep.

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,057
The same as it's been
for the last 20 years.

00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:12,428
Please, I just want someone to
tell me what this is all about.

00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:14,130
Her name is
Nora Waters.

00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,731
And she was told
to come down here.

00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:16,799
I want to know
what's happening.

00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,201
Excuse me. Can I help you?

00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,303
Yes, my daughter,
Nora, was told to come...

00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:20,836
I understand.

00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:21,604
Understand.

00:10:21,604 --> 00:10:25,274
Um, your daughter's in,
talking to a colleague of mine.

00:10:25,274 --> 00:10:26,509
I'm D.B. Russell.

00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:28,277
Bruce Waters.

00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:30,379
Can you tell me
what this is all about?

00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,381
Your daughter's fingerprints
were found

00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,183
at the scene of a homicide.

00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:35,451
What?

00:10:35,451 --> 00:10:36,319
The victim's name

00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:37,753
was a Damon Harlow.

00:10:38,487 --> 00:10:39,789
Did you know Mr. Harlow?

00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:43,793
Yes, yes, I know who he is.

00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:46,395
And I know my daughter
is friends with him.

00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:49,265
Wait, you're not thinking
she did something?

00:10:49,265 --> 00:10:50,566
I'm sorry.

00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,235
There's not much more
I can tell you

00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,237
about an ongoing
investigation.

00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,774
Were you here back then,
20 years ago?

00:10:58,841 --> 00:10:59,842
Lucas Reem?

00:10:59,842 --> 00:11:01,611
Were you one of the ones
we dealt with?

00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:03,145
No, sir, I was not.

00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:04,347
But I'm aware of the case

00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:06,282
and what your family
went through.

00:11:06,282 --> 00:11:08,251
Well, then you know why...

00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:11,487
Nora is... fragile.

00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,357
Doesn't always make
the right choices in her life.

00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:15,791
Dating a man
like Damon Harlow,

00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,560
who profits
from others' suffering.

00:11:19,562 --> 00:11:21,264
But my wife and I...

00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:24,066
see, Nora is all we've got.

00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:25,768
I-I will do

00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,637
whatever I've got to do
to protect her.

00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,374
I'd do the same for my daughter.

00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,113
Nick, Nick, we're still
a work in progress here.

00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:37,613
That's okay.

00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,681
What do you got so far?

00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:41,417
I've counted 11 sharp-force
injuries to the chest

00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:44,253
and abdomen; one appears
to have penetrated the heart.

00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:45,688
So C.O.D. is
exsanguination.

00:11:45,688 --> 00:11:47,490
Those are some
wide stab wounds.

00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,524
What is that, a chef's knife?

00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:50,059
Or a similar instrument.

00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:52,295
Blade width is
at least two inches.

00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,564
Lucas Reem himself used
a chef's knife back in the '90s.

00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:57,800
I saw his work firsthand.

00:12:01,504 --> 00:12:03,072
This is curious.

00:12:03,739 --> 00:12:04,707
What is it?

00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,609
It's a bone fragment.

00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:08,678
From that busted rib?

00:12:08,678 --> 00:12:11,147
It's too discolored to be
from a fresh break.

00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,782
I suppose it could've been
floating around

00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:14,450
from an old injury.
What do you mean?

00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,819
Well, X-rays revealed
this guy

00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,587
has known his share of violence.

00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:20,589
A number
of long-healed fractures

00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:22,224
dating back
to his adolescence.

00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:23,526
Well, a childhood like that,

00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:26,762
maybe trading in murder
and mayhem only makes sense.

00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:30,199
To be honest, I think we all
have a bit of morbid curiosity.

00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:33,369
I once took the wife and kids
to see Bonnie and Clyde's car.

00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:34,570
We made a day out of it.

00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,571
Snapped photos,

00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:36,772
clowned around.

00:12:37,707 --> 00:12:40,676
Bonnie and Clyde
killed 13 people.

00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,412
Yeah, not so fun
when you keep that in mind, huh?

00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:44,313
Yeah.

00:12:45,314 --> 00:12:46,649
Okay.

00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:48,451
I'll have Hodges take a look.

00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,625
I analyzed the bone fragment

00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,427
pulled from
Damon Harlow's viscera.

00:12:58,427 --> 00:13:00,363
That bone fragment

00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,330
was hand-sharpened.

00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,165
It appears
to be the broken tip

00:13:03,165 --> 00:13:04,166
of a larger piece.

00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,701
So what are we saying?

00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,803
That the murder weapon was
a knife made out of bone?

00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:13,776
It's a weird choice of weaponry.

00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,212
I've seen knives
made out of bones before.

00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,280
You know, it's a hunter's hobby,
but they were made of,

00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,383
like, elk or deer.
Hmm.

00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,551
Yeah, I've seen those, too,
but this one isn't animal bone.

00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,586
It's human.

00:13:23,586 --> 00:13:25,621
What do you mean?
DNA match

00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:28,557
to one particular awful human.

00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,228
The bone came from Lucas Reem?

00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,130
Dead serial killer himself.

00:13:34,764 --> 00:13:36,065
STOKES:
So someone turned

00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:39,068
a mass murderer
into a murder weapon.

00:13:44,507 --> 00:13:46,275
The bone of a dead
serial killer,

00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:48,577
sharpened into a knife
and then used

00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,545
to kill again.

00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:50,646
Yeah.

00:13:50,646 --> 00:13:52,415
It's a whole new level
of demented.

00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:55,418
It's kind of like the old days
when they used

00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,685
the bones of dead saints

00:13:56,685 --> 00:13:59,054
to make souvenirs
and jewelry.

00:13:59,054 --> 00:14:02,291
The belief being that
the bones still carried

00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,526
some of the saint's essence.

00:14:03,526 --> 00:14:04,593
Yeah, but these guys,

00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,363
these conventions,
they worship serial killers.

00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:08,831
Maybe one of them

00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:10,566
took a fragment
from Lucas Reem,

00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:13,335
committed a crime in a way
to honor his idol.

00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:15,070
Right.
Yeah.
I agree.

00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,505
And I think
that Damon Harlow

00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:18,073
was killed
by his own merchandise.

00:14:18,073 --> 00:14:18,774
I found this article

00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,409
from a couple days ago.

00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:22,445
The same arrangement
of the stuff

00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:23,312
that he had on the table

00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:26,182
from the convention today,
but with one additional item,

00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:27,583
now missing.

00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:29,518
STOKES:
Bone-bladed knife.

00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:32,388
Killer must have swiped it
right off of Harlow's table.

00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:33,222
I also spoke

00:14:33,222 --> 00:14:34,623
to Harlow's
business associate,

00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,625
Alex Friel;
he said he knew that Damon

00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,395
had been dipping
into shadier collectibles,

00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:41,363
like the bones
of serial killers,

00:14:41,363 --> 00:14:43,165
but he just looked
the other way.

00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:45,167
Shady business
brings shady people.

00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:47,770
Maybe Harlow was doing
some after-hours deal

00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,772
with somebody, and the sale
just went sideways.

00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:52,074
And Harlow paid with his life.

00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:53,409
So if the killer swiped
the knife

00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:55,578
off the table,
maybe he left something behind.

00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:56,345
That's a good idea.

00:14:56,345 --> 00:14:58,447
Let's check the tablecloth
for touch DNA.

00:14:58,447 --> 00:14:59,215
I was also thinking,

00:14:59,215 --> 00:15:01,183
since Harlow was dealing
in illicit goods,

00:15:01,183 --> 00:15:03,285
it might make sense
to learn about the product.

00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:05,321
The knife. You know,
it might bring us closer

00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,556
to some of
his shadier associates.

00:15:07,556 --> 00:15:09,525
Because one of them
might be our killer.

00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:12,695
Well, based on
the cortical bone width

00:15:12,695 --> 00:15:13,662
of the fragment,

00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,498
the bone used to make
the blade came from

00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,466
Lucas Reem's tibia.
But now listen.

00:15:17,466 --> 00:15:20,436
The prison doctor did say that
Reem wasn't missing any bones

00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:22,137
at the time of his execution.

00:15:22,137 --> 00:15:24,673
So the tibia had to be removed
from him after death

00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,708
to make the knife.

00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,510
Exactly.
Question is:

00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,113
where was Lucas Reem's tibia
and the rest of him

00:15:31,113 --> 00:15:33,215
after his execution?

00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:37,786
RUSSELL: <i>It's my understanding,</i>
<i>Mr. Narvick,</i>

00:15:37,786 --> 00:15:40,189
that several months ago,
the state sent the body

00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,224
of Lucas Reem to your mortuary.

00:15:42,224 --> 00:15:44,226
Is that correct?
After his execution?

00:15:44,226 --> 00:15:45,261
That's correct.

00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:47,229
Mr. Reem didn't have any family.

00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:48,697
The body was to be cremated.

00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,432
It wasn't, right?

00:15:50,432 --> 00:15:52,801
I mean, 'cause part of it just
showed up at a murder scene.

00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,172
Want to tell me
how that might have happened?

00:16:00,242 --> 00:16:03,712
The body, Lucas Reem,
was stolen.

00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:05,714
It was on my
prep table.

00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,483
I had the door
open to let

00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:09,118
the night air freshen
my work space.

00:16:09,118 --> 00:16:10,586
I went to take a phone call.

00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:13,722
When I returned, he was gone.

00:16:15,524 --> 00:16:17,192
Did you report that
to the police?

00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:19,261
No, I did not.

00:16:19,828 --> 00:16:21,397
Oh.
I knew what
wretched things

00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,099
that man Reem had done,
and I thought the families

00:16:24,099 --> 00:16:26,669
deserved to believe
he'd been turned to ash,

00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:29,104
after all they'd been through.

00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:31,774
I bet you also didn't want
your-your business to suffer

00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:34,109
from the reports
of your negligence.

00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:36,612
I volunteered my services
free of charge,

00:16:36,612 --> 00:16:39,548
and it should end up
costing me customers?

00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:42,318
Okay, you didn't happen
to get a look

00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:44,153
at whoever might have
taken the body?

00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:46,288
Maybe their car,
something, anything?

00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:47,389
I do have something.

00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:50,693
I found a liquor bottle
outside the back door.

00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:53,362
Maybe the shot of courage
the thief needed.

00:16:53,362 --> 00:16:57,433
I kept it because I did intend
to call the police.

00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,734
Do you still have that bottle?

00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:14,316
♪ ♪

00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:33,268
Got your message. What's up?

00:17:33,268 --> 00:17:35,204
The print
on the bourbon bottle

00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:37,640
is a match to a local
named Todd Spanna.

00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,608
This is his Web site.

00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:42,378
"The man who brought down
Lucas Reem."

00:17:42,378 --> 00:17:43,746
Well, that line may work

00:17:43,746 --> 00:17:44,780
at a last call hookup,

00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,483
but I'm afraid the truth
is not quite so heroic.

00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,284
You know this guy?
I do.

00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:50,386
He's all over
the case files.

00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:52,154
Todd Spanna had
an apartment

00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,355
across from Lucas Reem.

00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:55,457
One night, he sees
Reem hosing blood

00:17:55,457 --> 00:17:57,693
off his hands, so he calls
the cops, turns him in,

00:17:57,693 --> 00:17:59,628
ends Lucas Reem's run.

00:18:00,262 --> 00:18:03,365
Well, it looks like he's turned
that into a little celebrity

00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:04,500
for himself.

00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,568
Did a couple of talk shows.
I think he even wrote a book?

00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:07,436
Yes, he did.

00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,138
He will sign it

00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:11,473
for $49.95.
There you go.

00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,442
Yeah, looks like Spanna
is really milking

00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:14,777
his connection
to the Reem case.

00:18:14,777 --> 00:18:17,179
He likes to show up at
Murderabilia conventions

00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,682
and sells a lot
of Reem souvenirs.

00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,450
Well, it was his bourbon
bottle at the scene

00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,651
of the mortuary theft.

00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:26,055
You think Spanna went after
the ultimate souvenir?

00:18:27,322 --> 00:18:28,624
Lucas Reem himself.

00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:31,460
Yeah, I figure you guys
are rapping

00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,495
with everyone
who knew Damon Harlow, huh?

00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:35,431
Yeah, I heard about the murder.

00:18:35,831 --> 00:18:37,666
If you're looking
for some pro bono help,

00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:38,667
I can...
Todd.

00:18:39,234 --> 00:18:42,371
We have evidence connecting you
to the theft of a body.

00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:44,573
(chuckles)
No.

00:18:44,673 --> 00:18:46,075
Lucas Reem's body.

00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:48,377
Went missing from the mortuary
a few months ago.

00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,113
A piece of it turned up in the
knife that killed Damon Harlow.

00:18:51,113 --> 00:18:52,114
Oh, h-hang on.

00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:54,550
You think that I shivved
Damon Harlow?

00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,618
I think stealing
a serial killer's corpse

00:18:56,618 --> 00:18:57,619
warrants a few questions.

00:18:57,619 --> 00:18:59,221
No, I didn't do that either.

00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,190
Your liquor bottle

00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,758
at the scene
of the body theft.

00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:05,627
Anybody could've put that there.

00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:07,696
Todd,

00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,765
why would anyone go
to all that trouble

00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:10,733
just to frame you?

00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,335
Do you know who I am to the
people who worship Lucas Reem?

00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:16,271
I am the antichrist, all right?

00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:17,639
I'm the one that put him away.

00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:19,842
I am the schmuck bunter
who ruined

00:19:19,842 --> 00:19:21,810
their hero's no-hitter
in the bottom of the ninth.

00:19:23,312 --> 00:19:26,515
And there are plenty
of bottles in my wake.

00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:28,450
Anyone could've
snagged one to frame me.

00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,352
People who worship Lucas Reem.

00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:31,754
Do you know any of them?

00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,223
A few.

00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:36,658
But none crazy enough
to steal his body.

00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:39,762
I mean, come on, I do
the legit conventions.

00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:42,264
(chuckles)
Ganking a corpse,

00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:45,067
man, that-that's
Blood Market stuff.

00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,635
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:19:46,635 --> 00:19:47,603
Blood Market?

00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:48,637
Yeah.

00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:50,839
Yeah, all the merch
at the convention, right?

00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:54,176
Autographs, photos,
the car, that's legal.

00:19:54,176 --> 00:19:56,411
But that's only half the stuff
that's out there.

00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:59,548
You want the truly forbidden?

00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,751
Want a snuff film?

00:20:03,485 --> 00:20:04,520
Hmm? Hot evidence?

00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,321
Serial killer's remains?

00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:08,090
You shop the Blood Market.

00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,626
And what sleazy strip mall
would I find all this in?

00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,261
Well, strictly online.

00:20:12,594 --> 00:20:14,329
Anonymous.

00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,168
But... but I could get you in.

00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:21,837
Give you my username
and password.

00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:41,390
♪ ♪

00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:45,761
How you doing with this
Blood Market Web site?

00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:48,363
I could use a shower after
looking at some of this stuff.

00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,166
So it turns out
that the murder weapon

00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,136
is not the only knife made
from Lucas Reem's bones.

00:20:54,136 --> 00:20:55,737
Rumored to be eight of them
out there.

00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:57,706
Any idea who has them?

00:20:57,706 --> 00:20:59,341
No, but there
is a user

00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,410
who is trying
to track them down.

00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,313
He goes by the name
of DesertSky60,

00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:07,316
and he has spent the last month
asking about those knives.

00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,551
I ran his username
through a search engine,

00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:11,687
to see if it would pop up
on any other site,

00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,255
and I found
this profile.

00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:17,125
"DesertSky60"
is Bruce Waters.

00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:20,596
Wow, Bruce Waters.

00:21:20,596 --> 00:21:23,298
That guy is chasing the relics

00:21:23,298 --> 00:21:25,300
of the man
who killed his daughter.

00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,568
Yeah, maybe hunting them down

00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:29,071
so that he can destroy them
once and for all?

00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:30,583
Maybe.

00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,107
This is even more
interesting.

00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:34,076
During his
last exchange,

00:21:34,076 --> 00:21:36,478
another user
was telling him,

00:21:36,478 --> 00:21:39,548
"There's a middleman
named Damon.

00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,750
He can hook you up
with whatever you want."

00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,352
Damon Harlow.
Mm-hmm.

00:21:43,352 --> 00:21:45,754
Then Waters replied,
"I know Damon.

00:21:45,754 --> 00:21:46,755
"Family connection.

00:21:46,755 --> 00:21:48,323
I'll see
what he can do."

00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,159
That was one day
before Damon Harlow was killed.

00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,830
Bruce Waters didn't mention
any of this when I met with him.

00:21:55,297 --> 00:21:59,368
So maybe he wasn't just going
after the Lucas Reem knives,

00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:00,702
but the people selling them.

00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:04,139
He did say that
Damon Harlow was profiting

00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:05,641
from the suffering of others.

00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,810
DNA came back
on the tablecloth

00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,178
that the knife
was snatched from.

00:22:10,178 --> 00:22:12,447
There was only one
identifiable contributor.

00:22:12,447 --> 00:22:15,784
A male familial match
to Nora Waters.

00:22:18,287 --> 00:22:20,122
It was her father.

00:22:20,122 --> 00:22:21,590
Bruce Waters picks up
the knife,

00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,460
then he makes
Damon Harlow suffer.

00:22:30,065 --> 00:22:32,234
STOKES: <i>Bruce Waters' wife said</i>
<i>he drove off after lunch,</i>

00:22:32,234 --> 00:22:33,435
and she hadn't heard
from him since.

00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,304
We've got a BOLO
out on his vehicle,

00:22:35,304 --> 00:22:36,538
we've tracked
his credit cards,

00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:38,340
but he could be three
states away by now.

00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,409
No, I met the guy
this morning at PD.

00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:42,711
Looked me right in the eye
and then shook my hand.

00:22:42,711 --> 00:22:46,081
Less than 12 hours
after Damon Harlow was killed.

00:22:46,081 --> 00:22:48,650
Well, that takes some
brass, doesn't it?

00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,185
Walk into a
police station

00:22:50,185 --> 00:22:52,054
with that fresh kill
all over your hands.

00:22:52,054 --> 00:22:54,456
He was adamant
about protecting his daughter.

00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,624
Maybe he was trying
to make sure

00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,393
that she didn't take
the fall for his crime.

00:22:58,393 --> 00:23:01,496
And as soon as he saw that
she was released, then he fled.

00:23:01,496 --> 00:23:04,066
Let's bring
his daughter back in.

00:23:04,566 --> 00:23:07,235
I told you,
I don't know where he is.

00:23:09,838 --> 00:23:10,572
(sighs)

00:23:11,773 --> 00:23:16,144
Nora, your father was
hunting Lucas Reem's remains.

00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,081
That hunt led him to Damon,
and I think it made him snap,

00:23:19,081 --> 00:23:21,783
knowing that his surviving
daughter was dating a man

00:23:21,783 --> 00:23:24,119
who kept relics
of Lucas Reem.

00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,821
We have evidence of him there
at the convention site.

00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,522
We believe that he killed Damon.

00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:29,391
That's not what happened.

00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:32,594
Then tell me what happened.

00:23:34,196 --> 00:23:36,264
My dad came to me
a few days ago.

00:23:37,265 --> 00:23:39,434
He had tears in his eyes.

00:23:39,768 --> 00:23:41,069
He told me what
he'd heard.

00:23:41,536 --> 00:23:44,606
Pieces of Lucas Reem
out there for sale.

00:23:46,141 --> 00:23:49,544
He asked if Damon could
help track them down.

00:23:49,711 --> 00:23:51,346
Here's the deal-- I
told him I got a buyer.

00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:53,315
It's 20 grand, cash.

00:23:53,315 --> 00:23:55,083
Dad, you can't afford that.

00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,218
I'll figure it out.

00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:57,085
They're gonna bring
the items to the lot

00:23:57,085 --> 00:23:59,054
behind the Palermo,
8:00 tomorrow night.

00:23:59,054 --> 00:24:00,756
That's all I can do.
You're on your own.

00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,190
Let's go.

00:24:03,592 --> 00:24:05,627
Wait, are you saying that that
deal was gonna happen tonight?

00:24:05,794 --> 00:24:08,230
A few hours ago, yeah.
Why didn't you tell me
all this before?

00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,365
Because Dad was hell-bent
on getting those relics

00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,566
and destroying them.

00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:13,335
This might have been
his only chance.

00:24:13,335 --> 00:24:15,804
I didn't want anyone
getting in Dad's way.

00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,319
Deal was supposed to go down
somewhere in this lot.

00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:33,655
Whatever Bruce Waters
might have done,

00:24:33,655 --> 00:24:35,323
he's a desperate dad.

00:24:35,323 --> 00:24:37,359
It's hard not to feel
sorry for him.

00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:39,127
He probably thought
he was just

00:24:39,127 --> 00:24:40,529
doing right by his family.

00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,402
Nick, there's
some blood over here.

00:24:55,177 --> 00:24:55,811
STOKES:
Oh, Bruce.

00:24:55,811 --> 00:24:58,480
What'd you go
and get yourself into, man?

00:25:06,054 --> 00:25:07,289
No, no, he's gone.

00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:11,493
Charlie 0-4 Stokes.

00:25:11,493 --> 00:25:13,095
We've got a 419.

00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,330
Roll homicide and a coroner
to my location.

00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,300
I got a Beretta.

00:25:23,305 --> 00:25:25,407
Magazine doesn't have a single
scratch from loading.

00:25:25,407 --> 00:25:28,210
I don't think there's ever been
a bullet in this gun.

00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,212
Whoever brought this had
no intention of using it.

00:25:30,345 --> 00:25:33,215
You know what I think? I think
he never had the 20 grand

00:25:33,215 --> 00:25:34,850
to buy those bone-bladed knives,

00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:38,453
and he brought that gun out here
to do some negotiating.

00:25:39,087 --> 00:25:40,522
They called his bluff.

00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:43,191
He underestimated
who he was bargaining with.

00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:45,293
And it looks like...

00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:48,263
he was stabbed
at least ten times.

00:25:49,164 --> 00:25:51,099
And there's some
silver-colored trace here.

00:25:53,568 --> 00:25:55,804
Nick, there's something
in his mouth.

00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,552
What the hell is that?

00:26:13,088 --> 00:26:14,689
SIDLE: <i>The odd object</i>
<i>from the victim's mouth</i>

00:26:14,689 --> 00:26:17,492
was actually a strand
of black suede,

00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,194
like from a fringed
suede jacket.

00:26:19,194 --> 00:26:21,263
Bruce Waters must have
bit it off his assailant

00:26:21,263 --> 00:26:22,497
while tangled up with him.

00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,534
And Bruce Waters' assailant
was wearing

00:26:25,534 --> 00:26:28,637
the exact jacket that Lucas
Reem is wearing in this photo.

00:26:29,104 --> 00:26:31,173
Got all that from
one strand of suede?

00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:32,741
Henry ran DNA on the strand,

00:26:32,741 --> 00:26:35,243
found a contribution
from Lucas Reem himself.

00:26:35,243 --> 00:26:37,212
You mean to tell me now
there's somebody out there

00:26:37,212 --> 00:26:39,247
that's not only collecting
Lucas Reem's bones,

00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:40,549
but now wearing his jacket?

00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:42,250
Kind of feels like
someone's trying

00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,251
to bring him back to life.

00:26:43,251 --> 00:26:43,818
Yeah.

00:26:44,252 --> 00:26:46,288
You know what,
there were...

00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:47,389
Right here.

00:26:47,656 --> 00:26:49,658
I remember, there were
odd blood patterns

00:26:49,658 --> 00:26:51,526
at Damon Harlow's
crime scene.

00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,360
Take a look at that.

00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,163
Fringe from a jacket could have
caused that pattern.

00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:00,135
It looks like
the same killer

00:27:00,135 --> 00:27:03,271
that killed Damon Harlow
killed Bruce Waters.

00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:04,272
Good bet.

00:27:04,506 --> 00:27:08,076
All right, so how do we think
it all played out?

00:27:08,076 --> 00:27:11,413
Well, Damon Harlow agreed to
help Bruce find the bone knives,

00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:12,581
set him up
with a seller.

00:27:12,581 --> 00:27:15,050
Hours later,
Harlow is killed.

00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,586
The next night, Bruce Waters
goes to meet the seller,

00:27:17,586 --> 00:27:18,753
and Bruce is killed.

00:27:18,753 --> 00:27:22,224
Maybe the seller knew
he was being set up.

00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:24,392
Knew that Bruce
Waters was the buyer

00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,727
and that Bruce's
only reason

00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,696
to want those relics
was to destroy them.

00:27:27,696 --> 00:27:29,464
Seller wasn't happy
about being played,

00:27:29,464 --> 00:27:31,233
so he kills Harlow
for the betrayal,

00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,702
and he takes Bruce out
at the buy-site.

00:27:33,702 --> 00:27:38,139
So who out there is wearing
that jacket and two murders?

00:27:46,615 --> 00:27:47,382
Mmm.

00:27:47,382 --> 00:27:50,385
That jacket would be
a primo item.

00:27:50,652 --> 00:27:52,487
But I don't know who has it.

00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:54,489
But you know who might know,
am I right?

00:27:54,489 --> 00:27:55,190
Mm.

00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,459
Oh, come on, Todd,
give me that much.

00:27:58,393 --> 00:27:59,194
Maybe.

00:27:59,361 --> 00:28:00,228
So how do I meet

00:28:00,228 --> 00:28:02,530
some of these Blood Market
traders face-to-face?

00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,467
No, these cats do
not talk to cops.

00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:06,701
Well, I won't go as a cop.

00:28:06,701 --> 00:28:09,137
I'll go as, uh, a collector.

00:28:09,137 --> 00:28:10,438
(laughs)

00:28:10,572 --> 00:28:12,073
You can laugh all you want,

00:28:12,073 --> 00:28:15,076
but the title of your memoir
was <i>Cracking the Case.</i>

00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:17,746
Don't let me down here, man.

00:28:19,247 --> 00:28:20,181
Okay.

00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,554
Some of the Blood Market guys
did come down to the convention.

00:28:26,721 --> 00:28:28,657
And I might have
overheard them talking

00:28:28,657 --> 00:28:31,192
about a place that
they'd be partying.

00:28:31,192 --> 00:28:31,793
Good.

00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,428

(laughs) Look,

00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,834
they are never gonna
let a random like you in.

00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:41,336
Well, what if...

00:28:41,336 --> 00:28:46,107
I bring something
very special to their party?

I was gonna pick up
his car,

00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,149

been eighty-sixed.

you got that one vein,

just working overtime,

00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,569

00:32:02,737 --> 00:32:05,707

when you and
the spirit of Lucas Reem

00:34:40,561 --> 00:34:42,530
went to that lot to
kill Bruce Waters,

00:34:43,731 --> 00:34:44,766
where'd you park?

Why do you want to know that?

00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,436
Because the lab just told me

that the jacket
you were wearing is a fake.

00:34:50,304 --> 00:34:53,808
So that makes me think

00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:57,412
You're just a wannabe
and you're here wasting my time.

00:35:00,248 --> 00:35:02,450
All right, maybe I wasn't there
for the murder.

00:35:03,418 --> 00:35:06,421
Just heard about it
while I was clocked in at work.

00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:07,789

himself would do.

00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,549
No trace of blood
on them, and DNA says

00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,651
that they were not made
from Lucas Reem's bones.

00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:38,252
Well, that's not
surprising.

00:35:39,253 --> 00:35:41,089
Warren's a
deluded wannabe.

Well, not exactly.

00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:45,793
One of those knives he had was
made out of real human bone--

00:35:45,793 --> 00:35:48,362
the bone of a different
serial killer.

00:35:48,362 --> 00:35:49,430

Gerald Palmer.

What's this have

00:35:52,767 --> 00:35:55,303
Well, the article says that
a certain Cleveland mortician

00:36:03,845 --> 00:36:08,116
Okay, so this guy lied to me
about Reem's body being stolen.

00:36:08,116 --> 00:36:10,184
Kept it for himself, obviously.

00:36:10,184 --> 00:36:12,520
It sounds like he's been
collecting for years.

00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,188

00:36:16,057 --> 00:36:19,694

to protect his collection.

00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:44,812
and used it
for nefarious purpose...

00:37:46,113 --> 00:37:49,350
A proper hobbyist
will always be open to a trade.

00:37:50,151 --> 00:37:51,686
Meaning what?

00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,421
In exchange
for forgiveness

00:37:53,421 --> 00:37:55,189
of my misdemeanors...

00:37:57,091 --> 00:37:59,160
you get my customer list.

00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,066
Well, the mortician's
alibis checked out.

00:38:05,066 --> 00:38:07,301
Does the customer list
he gave us seem legit?

00:38:07,301 --> 00:38:08,536
Just started going through it.

00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,805
The descriptions, the prices,

00:38:10,805 --> 00:38:13,441
the shipping addresses for
some of the items he sold.

00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:15,142
This one stands out.

00:38:15,142 --> 00:38:18,813
"Knife made from Lucas Reem bone
with a silver-painted handle."

00:38:18,846 --> 00:38:20,815
Like the trace found
in Bruce Waters' wound.

00:38:20,815 --> 00:38:23,417
That could be the weapon
that killed him.

00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:24,719
Who bought it?

00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,188
Same person who bought

00:38:27,188 --> 00:38:29,190
all the Lucas Reem knives
on this list.

00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,759
No-name P.O. box

00:38:31,759 --> 00:38:33,127
in a podunk town.

00:38:34,629 --> 00:38:35,830
"Dead Owl Creek."

00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,232
Could be a-a rental mailbox.
I mean, it looks like

00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,667
the buyer has gone
out of his way

00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:42,136
to remain anonymous.
Except I already met him.

00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,237
He's one of the guys

00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,739
who ducked under the tape
at the crime scene.

00:38:45,373 --> 00:38:45,806
Got to be something

00:38:45,806 --> 00:38:48,242
cooler to do in
"Dead Owl Creek"?

00:39:03,357 --> 00:39:04,225
SANDERS:
You think he'd approve?

00:39:12,566 --> 00:39:14,101
Of everything you've done?

00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,636
You were doing it
for him, right?

00:39:15,636 --> 00:39:17,138
Protecting his legacy?

00:39:17,138 --> 00:39:18,572
We searched your car, Kyle.

00:39:19,674 --> 00:39:21,175
We found the bone knives.

00:39:21,175 --> 00:39:21,676
The jacket.

00:39:21,676 --> 00:39:22,810
You kept them
all together.

00:39:23,477 --> 00:39:24,478
Wasn't that the point?

00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,415
Collecting all those relics,

00:39:27,415 --> 00:39:29,784
making sure
that the last traces

00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,786
of Lucas Reem
were never lost,

00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,487
never destroyed?

00:39:35,323 --> 00:39:37,325
Lucas will live forever.

00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,293
You see, that dealer

00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,094
and that pathetic father,

00:39:40,094 --> 00:39:41,562
they thought
they were smarter than me.

00:39:42,663 --> 00:39:45,199
Thought that they could
take him away from me.

00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:46,767
So you took
two lives

00:39:46,767 --> 00:39:50,771
over a batch of decaying bones.

00:39:54,842 --> 00:39:57,111
(grunting)

00:39:58,245 --> 00:40:01,816
(grunting)

00:40:06,253 --> 00:40:07,455
The thing
I want to know is:

00:40:07,455 --> 00:40:10,591
why did you come back here,
to see Damon Harlow's body

00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:12,093
in that car?

00:40:12,093 --> 00:40:13,761
Felt like I had dreamt it.

00:40:15,229 --> 00:40:17,098
Wanted to make sure
that I hadn't.

00:40:17,431 --> 00:40:18,766
But it wasn't
just in my head.

00:40:18,766 --> 00:40:20,234
You know? It was...

00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,571
It was real.

00:40:24,071 --> 00:40:28,242
What Lucas and I have,
that's real.

00:40:28,242 --> 00:40:30,344
He will be with me forever.

00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,080
Well, you're one needle away

00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,482
from making that dream
come true.

00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:44,558
(handcuffs clicking)

00:40:58,639 --> 00:40:59,540
Nora...

00:41:01,509 --> 00:41:02,676
I just wanted
you to know

00:41:02,676 --> 00:41:05,246
that we caught the man
who killed your father.

00:41:05,446 --> 00:41:06,347
And Damon.

00:41:06,647 --> 00:41:08,449
He's being taken into
custody right now.

00:41:08,449 --> 00:41:10,084
So he's going away for good.

00:41:11,285 --> 00:41:14,121
He took both of them from me,
but he can't hurt anyone else.

00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:16,457
That's right.

00:41:16,457 --> 00:41:18,259
That's the same thing
my dad used to tell me

00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:20,394
when I was a kid,
about Lucas Reem,

00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,396
when I would cry out
in the middle of the night

00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:23,664
from a nightmare--
"Don't worry.

00:41:23,664 --> 00:41:26,700
That man's going away.
He can't hurt anyone else."

00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,704
But...
(sniffles)

00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,707
I guess he never
really believed that.

00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:38,112
20 years later, Lucas Reem
was still hurting him,

00:41:38,512 --> 00:41:40,414
still haunting him.

00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,583
You know...

00:41:43,717 --> 00:41:45,419
I think that
your father,

00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,655
by chasing after
those relics,

00:41:47,655 --> 00:41:51,659
in his own way was just trying
to end the nightmare.

00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,464
But... instead,
he just gave it new life.

00:41:59,133 --> 00:42:00,534
His own.

00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:11,812
