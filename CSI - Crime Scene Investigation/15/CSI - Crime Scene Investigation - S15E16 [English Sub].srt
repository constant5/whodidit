00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,372
Sexy.

00:00:25,718 --> 00:00:28,189
<i>Don't tell me</i>
<i>you don't feel it.</i>

00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:30,562
Do you want to take a ride?

00:00:32,464 --> 00:00:33,166
(giggles)

00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,736
Come on.

00:00:34,736 --> 00:00:37,709
I know you want to.

00:00:38,376 --> 00:00:40,582
That's why we're here.

00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,786
Right?

00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:48,163
The hiker called it in.

00:00:48,163 --> 00:00:50,300
Saw something glittering
near the trailhead.

00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:50,772
Glittering?

00:00:50,772 --> 00:00:53,206
Yeah, first he thought it
was trash, maybe tinfoil.

00:00:53,206 --> 00:00:55,712
Well, turns out it
wasn't tinfoil at all.

00:00:58,249 --> 00:00:59,786
More like a tin-woman.

00:00:59,786 --> 00:01:00,253
(cell phone rings)

00:01:00,253 --> 00:01:02,759
She never found that
yellow brick road.

00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:03,526
No.

00:01:03,526 --> 00:01:04,462
This is Crawford.

00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:07,669
Hey, Nick.

00:01:07,669 --> 00:01:09,305
Talk about your
Silver Surfer, huh?

00:01:09,305 --> 00:01:11,476
You get any I.D.
on her yet?
No purse.

00:01:11,476 --> 00:01:13,648
The only thing on her
besides this dress...

00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,656
...is blunt-force trauma.

00:01:17,656 --> 00:01:19,558
Do we have any idea
on the time of death?

00:01:19,558 --> 00:01:21,362
Jimmy, you got that, yeah?

00:01:21,362 --> 00:01:23,566
Yeah, liver temp puts it
between 12:00 a.m.

00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:24,435
and 3:00 a.m.

00:01:24,435 --> 00:01:27,174
Midnight and 3:00--
okay, thanks, Jimbo.

00:01:27,174 --> 00:01:28,576
That's one hell
of a sight.

00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,545
Yeah.

00:01:29,545 --> 00:01:31,282
That's straight out
of <i>Goldfinger.</i>

00:01:31,282 --> 00:01:32,317
What do you make of it?

00:01:32,317 --> 00:01:35,223
I hate to speculate before we've
collected any evidence,

00:01:35,223 --> 00:01:38,229
but this is Vegas,
she could just be eye candy

00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:40,167
for some rich guy's party,
for all we know.

00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,071
Eye candy, really?

00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:43,406
You can rent pretty
girls like this

00:01:43,406 --> 00:01:45,243
and paint them up
for parties nowadays.

00:01:45,243 --> 00:01:47,448
CRAWFORD: If she was
someone's eye candy fantasy,

00:01:47,448 --> 00:01:49,452
she's not anymore.

00:01:49,452 --> 00:01:52,391
They chewed her up,
and they spit her out.

00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:54,628

Looks like our
Silver Girl was more

00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:40,307
than just silver
on the outside.

00:03:40,307 --> 00:03:42,210
I found silver paint
in both lungs.

00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,550
So, blunt-force trauma
was not cause of death.

00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,686
No, she asphyxiated.

<i>In silver paint.</i>

Not something you

No, but this is,
at least in this town.

00:03:55,704 --> 00:03:57,874
Our girl here liked to party.

00:03:57,874 --> 00:03:59,311
Nasal perforations

00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:01,248
and irritations
in the lung passages

00:04:01,248 --> 00:04:02,684
suggest chronic
drug use.

00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:05,357
And besides the blunt-force
trauma, I found other evidence

00:04:05,357 --> 00:04:07,694
of a struggle before
she succumbed to the silver.

00:04:08,496 --> 00:04:10,533
There's a linear
contusion pattern

00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:11,936
over the
trapezius here.

00:04:11,936 --> 00:04:13,806
Looks like parallel lines.

00:04:13,806 --> 00:04:16,278
Yeah, kind of like
a barbecue grill.

00:04:16,278 --> 00:04:18,549
Whatever it was,
it impacted her strongly.

00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,385
There's also a

00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:21,522
strange bruising pattern

00:04:21,522 --> 00:04:23,393
right here between
the lines.

00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:26,432
Dug out some glass particles
from her elbow.

00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,734

Hey.

00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:34,281
Got an I.D. on
our Silver Girl.

00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:36,018
Her prints were
in the system.

00:04:36,018 --> 00:04:39,525
Ava Montrose, a local
with a long sheet.

00:04:39,525 --> 00:04:41,862
Numerous burglary
and drug arrests.

00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:42,898
Next of kin?

00:04:42,898 --> 00:04:46,038
Her last known address was her
mother's place in Summerlin.

00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:47,741
Her mom is on
her way here now.

00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:50,313
Sara's going to do
the notification.

00:04:50,313 --> 00:04:53,953
SIDLE:
Mrs. Montrose, when was the last
time you saw your daughter?

00:04:53,953 --> 00:04:57,727
I haven't seen Ava
for months.

00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,700
I was always afraid something
like this was going to happen.

00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,739
Crowds she ran with,
places she'd go.

00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:05,042
What places
would that be?

00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:07,681
Places where you-you buy drugs.

00:05:09,384 --> 00:05:12,457
Dangerous-looking drug dealer
once showed up at our door,

00:05:12,457 --> 00:05:13,793
looking for her.

00:05:13,793 --> 00:05:15,964
Did you catch
the drug dealer's name?

00:05:15,964 --> 00:05:16,832
No.

00:05:16,832 --> 00:05:20,072
And Ava wouldn't say.

00:05:20,072 --> 00:05:22,644
We never had the
best relationship.

00:05:22,644 --> 00:05:23,312
Why's that?

00:05:23,312 --> 00:05:25,316
(father sighs)

00:05:25,316 --> 00:05:28,054
She resented me.

00:05:28,054 --> 00:05:30,560
For taking the place
of her father.

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,531
After Ruth and he split up.

00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:33,799
It's not your
fault, Duncan.

00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:34,568
Truth is,

00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:37,841
Ava didn't listen
to anybody but Ava.

00:05:39,645 --> 00:05:41,382
Do you have children,
Miss Sidle?

00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,051
I don't.

00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,790
It's not right for a mother
to bury her daughter.

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,435
It's not right.

00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:52,938
(crying):
It's not right.

00:05:55,743 --> 00:05:57,948
We are gonna find out
who did this.

00:05:57,948 --> 00:06:00,687
Is there anyone that you can
think of that I should talk to?

00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:01,922
A friend or boyfriend?

00:06:01,922 --> 00:06:03,593
Ava had lots
of boyfriends.

00:06:03,593 --> 00:06:05,930
Nothing serious.

00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,601
I-I wish I could
help more,

00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:11,542
but Ava, her life,
her friends,

00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:14,915
she was always
a mystery to me.

00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:20,927
Redecorating your
mother's house?

00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,597
I am, actually.

00:06:22,597 --> 00:06:24,100
But that's not
why I'm studying

00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,403
these shades of gray.

00:06:25,403 --> 00:06:28,509
The silver covering our victim's
body was indeed paint.

00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:29,878
But not just
any paint.

00:06:29,878 --> 00:06:31,448
Chromic potassium
sulfate.

00:06:31,448 --> 00:06:33,084
Chrome?
Exactly.

00:06:33,084 --> 00:06:35,523
It's a new environmentally
friendly chrome

00:06:35,523 --> 00:06:37,694
that's being used
in the auto-painting industry.

00:06:37,694 --> 00:06:39,831
This color is called
"silver zephyr."

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,639
What about the glass
shards in her elbow?

00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,908
They follow
a similar road.

00:06:44,908 --> 00:06:46,545
The glass is
from a car headlamp.

00:06:46,545 --> 00:06:48,783
It's made of bisphenal
polycarbonate.

00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:52,390
And it's suggestive
of a non-sealed beam headlamp.

00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:56,565
Now, those were discontinued
by government mandate in 1939.

00:06:56,565 --> 00:06:59,103
I'm thinking that Ava Montrose
was in an altercation

00:06:59,103 --> 00:07:00,873
in close proximity
to a car.

00:07:00,873 --> 00:07:02,410
Now, Doc thought

00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,915
that these grill marks
might be from a barbecue,

00:07:04,915 --> 00:07:07,721
but perhaps they're
from a car.

00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:09,090
And not just any car;

00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,194
a classic car,
pre-1939.

00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:13,699
Doesn't exactly narrow it down.

00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,837

Yeah, well, bruising

00:08:12,984 --> 00:08:13,953

Number two is

00:09:00,145 --> 00:09:02,149
Maybe.

00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:04,554
All right, you know, I say
that we just pay the fines,

00:09:04,554 --> 00:09:07,259

00:09:53,652 --> 00:09:55,255
Hang on. What happened here?

00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:56,758
Where do you keep
your Packard?

00:09:56,758 --> 00:09:57,660
In the vault.

00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,929
"The vault"?

00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:00,900
Yeah, that's what
I said, the vault.

00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,741
It's in a warehouse
downtown.

00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:12,255
My dad was a classic
car collector,

00:10:12,255 --> 00:10:15,730
and, uh, he built this place
to keep his babies safe.

00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,834
Somebody forget to pay
the power bill?

00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:18,290
Nope.

00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,171
No, my dad liked
to show his cars off.

00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:23,010
His favorite part was
the unveiling.

00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,301
Welcome to car heaven.

00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,203
Wow.

00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:38,274
They don't make 'em
like these anymore.

00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:40,178
Is that a '57 Chevy?

00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:40,946
You got it.

00:10:40,946 --> 00:10:42,149
Uh, V-8 engine

00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:44,353
and twin barrel...
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:46,925
All I know is that
it's old and it's slow.

00:10:46,925 --> 00:10:49,096
That's one way to look at it.

00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:50,665
Where's the Packard?

00:10:50,665 --> 00:10:52,937
Oh! Um... yeah,
it's getting a touch-up.

00:10:52,937 --> 00:10:54,273
It's in the mechanic's bay.

00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:56,644
What the hell's going on?

00:10:56,644 --> 00:10:58,014
What do you think
you're doing, Carlo?

00:10:58,014 --> 00:10:59,818
I told you,
no buyers!

00:10:59,818 --> 00:11:01,955
No, you need to back up,
dude, okay?
Who are you?

00:11:01,955 --> 00:11:03,224
The owner of these cars.

00:11:04,126 --> 00:11:06,197
This is my charming
brother, Aron.

00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:07,265
And you are not the owner.

00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:09,670
Neither are you.
They're not for sale.

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,773
We're not buyers.

00:11:10,773 --> 00:11:12,709
CARLO:
They're cops.
SIDLE: We're CSIs.

00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:15,682
We're investigating a murder--
a woman named Ava Montrose.

00:11:17,352 --> 00:11:18,087
Ava?

00:11:18,087 --> 00:11:19,389
My ex, Aron.

00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:20,860
You remember her.

00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,030
It's hard to keep track
of your bimbo parade.

00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,735
I-I don't understand. What does
this have to do with the vault?

00:11:37,058 --> 00:11:38,094
Hey, Sara.

00:11:38,094 --> 00:11:40,198
Can you come here a sec?

00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:42,435
Hey. You keep an eye
on them, please?

00:11:47,847 --> 00:11:49,349
Is this our '38 Packard?

00:11:49,349 --> 00:11:50,318
Yes, it is.

00:11:50,318 --> 00:11:53,791
And there definitely
was a struggle.

00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,965
That ended with
a fatal chrome bath.

00:11:59,036 --> 00:11:59,837
FINLAY:
Oh, check it out.

00:11:59,837 --> 00:12:01,273
Couple of drops of chrome.

00:12:01,273 --> 00:12:03,277
Kind of looks like
they're heading out the door.

00:12:03,277 --> 00:12:05,715
Yeah, maybe carrying
our Silver Woman.

00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,303
FINLAY:
Yep, the trail ends
right over here.

00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:18,741
The only empty
parking spot

00:12:18,741 --> 00:12:21,347
in the whole place.

00:12:21,347 --> 00:12:23,751
Hey, guys,
can you join us?

00:12:23,751 --> 00:12:24,319
I assume

00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:26,724
there's usually
a car parked here.

00:12:26,724 --> 00:12:28,127
Oh, my God, where's the car?

00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:29,062
What car?

00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:30,231
The '76 Cadillac.

00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:32,135
The most valuable car
in the collection.

00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:33,972
CARLO:
God, I can't believe this.

00:12:33,972 --> 00:12:36,076
Caddy's gone. Ava's dead.

00:12:37,245 --> 00:12:38,214
What the hell happened here?

00:12:38,214 --> 00:12:39,416
SIDLE:
Yeah, that's what
we'd like to know.

00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:40,752
Along with, what is it

00:12:40,752 --> 00:12:42,222
about your
stolen car

00:12:42,222 --> 00:12:43,491
that was worth dying over?

00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:49,202
I-I can't believe
this is happening.

00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:51,440
I mean,
who would do this?

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,279
Aron, we found no signs
of any break-in,

00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:56,116
so besides you
and your brother,

00:12:56,116 --> 00:12:58,087
who else had access
to the place?

00:12:58,087 --> 00:12:59,456
Uh, just Rubio, our mechanic.

00:12:59,456 --> 00:13:01,093
Uh, he's the only
other person who would know

00:13:01,093 --> 00:13:02,963
the security code.
And how well do you know him?

00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:05,468
If you're asking if I trust him,
absolutely.

00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:07,238
He's been with the family
for 20 years.

00:13:07,238 --> 00:13:07,872
He's not even

00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:08,541
in the country right now.

00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,445
He left for Italy two days ago.

00:13:10,445 --> 00:13:11,914
What about you?

00:13:11,914 --> 00:13:13,417
Where were you last night?

00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,989
I was at my studio, painting.

00:13:15,989 --> 00:13:17,358
Landscapes, not women.

00:13:17,358 --> 00:13:18,461
And Carlo?

00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:19,930
Where was he last night?

00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:23,471
Uh, I was in my office
until about midnight.

00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:24,439
SIDLE:
Anyone with you?

00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:26,944
No, I sent my assistant
home around about 10:00.

00:13:26,944 --> 00:13:29,216
How long were you
dating Ava Montrose?

00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:30,051
About a year.

00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:31,920
I tried cutting it off
six months into it,

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,428
but, uh, she had
a hard time letting go.

00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:36,830
If you weren't with
her last night,

00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,534
then what was
she doing here?

00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:40,004
That is a damn good question.

00:13:40,004 --> 00:13:42,041
Is there any chance that
Ava knew the security code?

00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,344
We used to come
down here a lot.

00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:45,982
She could've, I guess,
easily looked over my shoulder

00:13:45,982 --> 00:13:47,118
while I was punching it in.

00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,854
I mean, she did
love this place.

00:13:48,854 --> 00:13:51,193
She especially loved
my dad's old Caddy.

00:13:51,193 --> 00:13:53,497
Enough to try and steal it?

00:13:53,497 --> 00:13:54,566
Look...

00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:56,470
Ava was a messed-up kid.

00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,843
We both partied
way too hard back in the day.

00:13:59,843 --> 00:14:01,113
I mean, I cleaned up my act...

00:14:01,113 --> 00:14:04,119
but Ava did not.

00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:06,056
What can you tell me
about this car?

00:14:06,056 --> 00:14:07,559
'76 Caddy.

00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:09,062
Sounds nice, but...

00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:10,898
what, exactly,
makes it so valuable?

00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:13,837
My father was murdered in it.

00:14:13,837 --> 00:14:15,341
And that makes it more valuable?

00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:17,010
There's a certain crowd
of collectors

00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,616
who pay serious money
for so-called "death cars."

00:14:19,616 --> 00:14:21,186
James Dean's Porsche,

00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:23,090
Jayne Mansfield's
Buick Electra...

00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,595
I'm sorry, I don't
recognize the name "Derosa."

00:14:25,595 --> 00:14:27,064
Your father was famous?

00:14:27,064 --> 00:14:28,334
You're not from
around here, are you?

00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,369
No, I'm from Seattle.

00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,540
My dad was Alfonz Derosa.

00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,009
Kind of a Vegas legend.

00:14:33,544 --> 00:14:34,145
Okay, so you're saying

00:14:34,913 --> 00:14:38,120
that he was murdered
in the Cadillac?

00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,157
He was gunned down by a hit man.

00:14:40,157 --> 00:14:42,929
October 3, 1989.

00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:44,599
Killer worked for Pete Bamonte,

00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:45,901
a Chicago loan shark.

00:14:45,901 --> 00:14:48,072
I've heard that
story, actually.

00:14:48,072 --> 00:14:49,609
How much is the
Cadillac worth?

00:14:49,609 --> 00:14:50,645
It'd be close to a million.

00:14:50,645 --> 00:14:52,582
And the rest of
the collection?

00:14:52,582 --> 00:14:55,053
All up, we'd be talking
about five.

00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:58,126
I gather, from your argument,
that you're ready to sell,

00:14:58,126 --> 00:14:59,362
but your brother,
Aron, isn't.

00:14:59,362 --> 00:15:00,298
Yeah, we've been battling over

00:15:00,298 --> 00:15:02,635
what to do with
the collection since, um...

00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,239
our mom died.

00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:04,973
When was that?

00:15:04,973 --> 00:15:06,176
Two months ago.

00:15:06,176 --> 00:15:06,943
According to the will,

00:15:06,943 --> 00:15:09,048
we both own equal
shares in the cars.

00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:11,152
I offered to split the...
the collection in half.

00:15:11,152 --> 00:15:12,922
You know, I'd sell mine,
he could keep his.

00:15:12,922 --> 00:15:14,326
Actually, you know,
Aron's the one

00:15:14,326 --> 00:15:16,196
who could use the money, but...

00:15:16,196 --> 00:15:18,032
Van Gogh won't compromise.

00:15:18,032 --> 00:15:18,934
Van Gogh?

00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:20,504
Kid's a starving artist.

00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:22,007
(laughs)

00:15:22,007 --> 00:15:22,608
The worst kind.

00:15:22,608 --> 00:15:24,279
Talentless.

00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:26,015
Anyway, he needs to grow up.

00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:39,642
Talk about an icon
of Vegas history.

00:15:39,642 --> 00:15:40,678
Hmm.

00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:43,216
Didn't you write a book
about Vegas mobsters?

00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:45,220
Alfonz Derosa had
his own chapter.

00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,289
What was his story?

00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:48,494
Savvy businessman,
ruthless killer.

00:15:48,494 --> 00:15:51,633
He ran the skim at
the Tangier's counting room.

00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:53,437
Guy was known as "The Vise."

00:15:53,437 --> 00:15:55,941
I guess he didn't get his
nickname for his woodworking.

00:15:55,941 --> 00:15:58,179
It's how he broke
his enemies' knees.

00:15:58,179 --> 00:15:59,449
Mmm, they really
don't make 'em

00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:00,985
like they used to.
Nope.

00:16:00,985 --> 00:16:02,455
So tell me about
Derosa's murder.

00:16:02,455 --> 00:16:06,496
Well, in 1989,
The Vise was in a turf war

00:16:06,496 --> 00:16:09,702
with, uh, Pete Bamonte,
some hothead from Chicago.

00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,375
One night, The Vise took
his mistress for a drive

00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:16,081
up to a lovers' lane
near Mount Charleston.

00:16:16,081 --> 00:16:17,050
That was his last ride.

00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:19,656
♪ ♪

00:16:19,656 --> 00:16:20,291

<i>Then the mood was broken...</i>

00:16:26,603 --> 00:16:30,043
and Alfonz Derosa and
his mistress were dead.

00:16:30,043 --> 00:16:32,080
Some hit man
with ties to Bamonte

00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,151
was eventually convicted
for the murder.

00:16:34,151 --> 00:16:36,188
Some jailhouse snitch
dimed him out.

00:16:36,188 --> 00:16:38,159
He eventually died in prison.

00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,294
And what happened to the sons?

00:16:39,294 --> 00:16:40,397
They must've been pretty young.

00:16:40,397 --> 00:16:41,500
Their mother
raised them.

00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,302
And as far as anybody can tell,

00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,474
they didn't follow in
their dad's footsteps.

00:16:45,474 --> 00:16:47,478
So now one's
an investment banker

00:16:47,478 --> 00:16:48,647
and one's an artist,

00:16:48,647 --> 00:16:50,083
and they hate each other.

00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,388
And they both have access
to this place.

00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:54,324
I don't believe a word
either one of them says.

00:16:54,324 --> 00:16:58,700
So maybe our witness on wheels
can help us.

00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,489
Looks like
we've got blood

00:17:09,489 --> 00:17:12,027
on the hood ornament.

00:17:12,027 --> 00:17:13,095
That would confirm
your theory

00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:15,501
that Ava had a run-in
with the car.

00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:21,045

I think there's
some residue on it.

00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:42,320
SANDERS:
Got a partial shoe impression.

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,059
Could be a man's loafer.
SANDERS:
Could be.

00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:48,467
So Ava breaks her heel
trying to get away.

00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:51,573
Killer grabs her
near the chrome vat.

00:17:51,573 --> 00:17:55,046
(screams)

00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,622
FINLAY:
<i>Gives her a silver</i>
<i>dye job to die for.</i>

00:17:59,622 --> 00:18:03,295
SANDERS:
<i>Puts the body in the Caddy...</i>

00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:11,546
...and drives away.

00:18:13,817 --> 00:18:15,386
I know you don't
trust the brothers,

00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:18,827
but if one of them did it,

00:18:18,827 --> 00:18:20,531
why not clean up?

00:18:20,531 --> 00:18:21,800
You have a point.

00:18:25,808 --> 00:18:27,110
You got something?

00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,345
Yeah.

00:18:35,661 --> 00:18:38,099
It's a promotional magnet.

00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:39,569
"Cienzo's Pizzeria."

00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:41,305
Specks of chrome on it.

00:18:41,305 --> 00:18:43,175
Says to me
this was here last night.

00:18:43,175 --> 00:18:44,511
Maybe the killer dropped it.

00:18:44,511 --> 00:18:47,550
Gives us something
to sink our teeth into.

00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,730
Ah! Pizza party.

00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,566
Thanks for
the invite.

00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:57,504
All right, I've only got
a little while here.

00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:57,954
What do you got?

00:18:57,954 --> 00:18:59,541
Mmm. Mmm.
Yeah.

00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:00,744
I ran touch DNA

00:19:00,744 --> 00:19:02,782
on the security keypad
at the vault.

00:19:02,782 --> 00:19:05,788
Besides the brothers,
I found a match to Ava Montrose.

00:19:05,788 --> 00:19:07,457
Confirms she knew the password.

00:19:07,457 --> 00:19:09,227
And suggesting
maybe she graduated

00:19:09,227 --> 00:19:10,196
from stealing watches

00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:11,833
to stealing cars.

00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,337
Is that all you got there,
Papa John?

00:19:14,337 --> 00:19:15,841
Far from it.

00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:18,145
This is a slice of
Cienzo's pizza.

00:19:18,145 --> 00:19:20,149
Uh, the pizza parlor
with the promotional magnet.

00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:20,818
We were just there.

00:19:20,818 --> 00:19:21,552
HODGES:
Thin crust.

00:19:21,552 --> 00:19:22,922
Very New Yorky. Delish.

00:19:23,422 --> 00:19:25,727
I don't suppose one of
their employees is our killer?

00:19:25,727 --> 00:19:27,698
None of them has a record,
if that's what you're asking.

00:19:27,698 --> 00:19:29,568
And none of them collects cars.

00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,673
However, I did run the
credit cards for the past week

00:19:31,673 --> 00:19:34,679
and came across
a very interesting customer.

00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:35,546
Henry.

00:19:36,615 --> 00:19:37,317
What?

00:19:37,317 --> 00:19:38,619
The magnets, please.

00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:40,423
Right, right.

00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:42,293
I'm sorry.

00:19:42,293 --> 00:19:44,231
We picked up
these exemplar magnets

00:19:44,231 --> 00:19:45,166
at the pizzeria.

00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,370
I think I can
use them to explain

00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,639
what the magnet
that Greg found

00:19:48,639 --> 00:19:50,376
was doing at the
classic car vault.

00:19:50,376 --> 00:19:52,313
Allow me to
demonstrate.

00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:56,588
You're showing me
how a magnet works.

00:19:57,557 --> 00:19:59,929
Are you looking
to get fired today?

00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:01,733
Wait for it.

00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:04,204
Voilà.

00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:05,273
The magnet sticks

00:20:05,273 --> 00:20:06,441
to one side
of the fender,

00:20:06,441 --> 00:20:07,745
but not the
other. Why?

00:20:07,745 --> 00:20:10,616
Because this part of the
fender has been repaired.

00:20:10,616 --> 00:20:13,289
It's made with
Bondo automotive filler.

00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:14,859
So the magnet didn't stick.

00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:17,497
It's a little trick
that car appraisers use.

00:20:17,497 --> 00:20:18,265
ANDREWS:
And...

00:20:18,265 --> 00:20:19,769
according to
credit card records,

00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:21,438
there is a certain
Vegas car appraiser

00:20:21,438 --> 00:20:24,544
who eats at Cienzo's
once a week.

00:20:28,652 --> 00:20:30,489
Thanks for coming in,
Mr. Bixler.

00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:31,893
I have a couple
of questions

00:20:31,893 --> 00:20:33,729
about your car
appraisal business.

00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:35,266
Whatever you need.

00:20:35,266 --> 00:20:37,938
Are you familiar with
the Alfonz Derosa collection?

00:20:37,938 --> 00:20:38,807
Intimately.

00:20:38,807 --> 00:20:40,777
I was, uh, recently hired
by the estate

00:20:40,777 --> 00:20:43,582
to appraise their cars, just
after Mrs. Derosa passed away.

00:20:43,582 --> 00:20:44,684
When was that?

00:20:44,684 --> 00:20:46,923
Uh, about two months ago.
Hmm.

00:20:46,923 --> 00:20:49,361
So you haven't been back
to the vault since?

00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:51,231
No.

00:20:51,231 --> 00:20:53,635
I see.

00:20:53,635 --> 00:20:56,541
I understand that
you're also a regular

00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,913
at Cienzo's Pizzeria
on Flamingo.

00:20:58,913 --> 00:21:00,783
Guilty as charged.

00:21:00,783 --> 00:21:02,387
Uh, is that a crime?

00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:03,990
I mean, I know that
it's not good for me...

00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,829
Have you ever used one of their
magnets to appraise a car?

00:21:06,829 --> 00:21:07,831
Uh, yes.

00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:09,534
Uh, yeah, they're
quite handy.

00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:11,939
Explains why we found one
in the vault.

00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:15,579
Um, yeah, um, like I said,
I was there two months ago.

00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:16,415
Mm-hmm.

00:21:16,415 --> 00:21:18,987
Well, the pizzeria has
a great special right now.

00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:21,926
Large, two toppings
for $7.99.

00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:24,431
But it just started
this week.

00:21:24,431 --> 00:21:27,603
And we found this magnet
in Derosa's vault yesterday.

00:21:27,603 --> 00:21:28,973
It's the same place
where a woman

00:21:28,973 --> 00:21:30,810
named Ava Montrose was murdered.

00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:34,350
I do not like being lied to.

00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,319
Were you there last night?

00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,321
No.

00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:37,991
I swear, no. I...

00:21:37,991 --> 00:21:39,527
Come on, Mr. Bixler.

00:21:39,527 --> 00:21:41,598
Uh, but I was there
three days ago.

00:21:41,598 --> 00:21:44,404
So first it was two months ago,
and now it's three days ago.

00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:46,675
Look, I realize I lied
to you. I'm sorry.

00:21:46,675 --> 00:21:48,947
Um, I have a very
good reason.

00:21:48,947 --> 00:21:50,583
What's that?

00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,353
Carlo Derosa,

00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:54,591
uh, he hired me to do
an updated appraisal

00:21:54,657 --> 00:21:56,761
of a '76 Cadillac.

00:21:56,761 --> 00:21:58,499
A very generous one.

00:21:58,499 --> 00:21:59,801
He can be most persuasive.

00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:01,304
Why did he want a new appraisal?

00:22:01,304 --> 00:22:02,941
He wouldn't tell me.
I can only assume

00:22:02,941 --> 00:22:04,544
that he had a
buyer lined up.

00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,947
Did his brother Aron
know about it?

00:22:05,947 --> 00:22:07,383
No.

00:22:07,383 --> 00:22:10,022
No, if he found out, I'm sure
he would have blocked the sale.

00:22:10,022 --> 00:22:13,529
Look, I'm a little scared
telling you all this.

00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:14,364
Um...

00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:20,376
Uh, you know who Carlo
Derosa's father was?

00:22:20,376 --> 00:22:22,914
Yeah, I know.

00:22:22,914 --> 00:22:24,918
RUSSELL:
<i>You know, this whole thing is</i>
<i>starting to look more and more</i>

00:22:24,918 --> 00:22:25,987
like an inside job.

00:22:25,987 --> 00:22:27,356
One that went
sideways.

00:22:27,356 --> 00:22:29,694
Carlo Derosa wants to sell
his father's Caddy.

00:22:29,694 --> 00:22:31,865
His brother gets wind
of the sale and stops him.

00:22:31,865 --> 00:22:33,368
Right, so Carlo calls

00:22:33,368 --> 00:22:35,906
his morally-challenged
ex-girlfriend.

00:22:35,906 --> 00:22:37,877
But he doesn't want
to get his hands dirty,

00:22:37,877 --> 00:22:39,347
and he needs an alibi.

00:22:39,347 --> 00:22:41,585
So maybe Ava enlists one
of her sketchy friends to help.

00:22:41,585 --> 00:22:43,889
Someone with experience
in auto theft.

00:22:43,889 --> 00:22:45,859
Friend sees the car,
gets greedy...

00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:49,100
Kills her, takes the
car, dumps her body.

00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,836
Hey.

00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:51,404
We need
to talk shoes.

00:22:52,907 --> 00:22:54,043
Not yours.

00:22:54,043 --> 00:22:57,650
Just got the result on the trace
we found on Ava's broken heel.

00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,654
Elements of concrete

00:22:59,654 --> 00:23:01,024
and titanium oxide.

00:23:01,024 --> 00:23:01,891
Now, I've seen this before.

00:23:01,891 --> 00:23:03,695
It's a unique road-paving
material they use

00:23:03,695 --> 00:23:04,864
to eliminate
pollution.

00:23:04,864 --> 00:23:07,637
It's found on a half-mile strip
of Verdugo Street.

00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:09,440
That's an industrial
neighborhood, right?

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,142
Exactly.

00:23:10,142 --> 00:23:12,380
And I did some searching--
it's the exact neighborhood

00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,788
it'a the exact neighborhood
where Ava Montrose just rented
a 20-by-20 storage unit.

00:23:16,788 --> 00:23:18,859
That's the perfect
size to hide a car.

00:23:29,514 --> 00:23:32,153
STOKES: Busted lock--
someone got here before us.

00:23:45,412 --> 00:23:47,183
CRAWFORD:
LVPD.

00:23:47,183 --> 00:23:49,454
Anybody in here?

00:23:49,454 --> 00:23:50,656
Here's our Caddy.

00:23:51,991 --> 00:23:53,161
Yeah.

00:23:53,161 --> 00:23:55,733
(clattering)

00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,472
LVPD. Come on out.

00:24:00,175 --> 00:24:01,945
Listen to me.

00:24:01,945 --> 00:24:06,721
If you don't want to die today,
show yourself slowly.

00:24:11,931 --> 00:24:13,702
Let me see some hands.

00:24:16,508 --> 00:24:19,447
You're making a mistake.

00:24:19,447 --> 00:24:21,584
No, you're the one
who's made the mistake.

00:24:25,057 --> 00:24:26,895
Aron, you mind telling me
what you were doing

00:24:26,895 --> 00:24:30,235
in a murdered woman's storage
space with a stolen car?

00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:31,938
It's not what
it looks like.
No?

00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:33,975
Well, I'll tell you what
it looks like to me.

00:24:33,975 --> 00:24:35,712
You recruited
Ava Montrose,

00:24:35,712 --> 00:24:36,748
your brother's ex,

00:24:36,748 --> 00:24:38,218
the one you
barely remembered,

00:24:38,218 --> 00:24:40,087
to help you steal
your Daddy's Caddy

00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:41,891
before your brother
could sell it.

00:24:41,891 --> 00:24:43,562
So, what happened?

00:24:43,562 --> 00:24:45,766
Uh, Ava-- the whacked-out
drug addict--

00:24:45,766 --> 00:24:47,168
did she try to
play you somehow?

00:24:47,168 --> 00:24:47,970
You get angry.

00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,039
Things get ugly.

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,809
You got it wrong.

00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:53,047
About Ava and about me.

00:24:53,047 --> 00:24:54,250
I do?

00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,051
Oh, uh, okay.

00:24:55,051 --> 00:24:57,055
Well, e-enlighten me.

00:24:57,055 --> 00:24:59,494
I'm not a thief,
and I'm not a murderer.

00:24:59,494 --> 00:25:01,498
And Ava?

00:25:01,498 --> 00:25:03,969
She was an addict,
but she wasn't a whack-job.

00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,171
She was a beautiful soul.

00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:07,910
It sounds like you're the one
that had a thing for her.

00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,112
She loved me.

00:25:09,112 --> 00:25:11,518
She left Carlo for me.
Right.

00:25:11,518 --> 00:25:13,555
No, that kind of thing
happens all the time.

00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:15,024
Uh, girl dumps
a high-rolling,

00:25:15,024 --> 00:25:16,794
Mercedes-driving
investment banker

00:25:16,794 --> 00:25:17,763
for a...

00:25:17,763 --> 00:25:21,271
I'm sorry, where
do you work?

00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:22,806
I manage a copy store.

00:25:22,806 --> 00:25:24,644
And there's nothing
wrong with that,

00:25:24,644 --> 00:25:26,948
but maybe you
see my point.

00:25:26,948 --> 00:25:27,983
Believe what you want.

00:25:27,983 --> 00:25:29,954
I don't give a rat's ass.

00:25:29,954 --> 00:25:32,993
All I know is Carlo
is the one who got to her.

00:25:32,993 --> 00:25:34,830
He knew exactly how to do it.

00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,701
With drugs?
Carlo's the one

00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,807
who put Ava up to stealing
the Caddy. I know it.

00:25:39,807 --> 00:25:41,644
He's the one who wanted
to sell it. I wouldn't...

00:25:41,644 --> 00:25:43,782
It's a great story, Aron,
but it still doesn't explain

00:25:43,782 --> 00:25:46,854
why you're the one we found
in that storage locker!

00:25:46,854 --> 00:25:49,159
I was trying
to get my car back.

00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:50,762
I set up a credit card
in Ava's name.

00:25:50,762 --> 00:25:53,300
Bills came to me, I saw
she rented a storage unit,

00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,772
I put two and two together--
that's why I was there.

00:25:55,772 --> 00:25:57,910
That car means
everything to me.

00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:01,551
It's the way
I remember my father.

00:26:01,551 --> 00:26:04,022
Right, because that's
where he died.

00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:05,091
No.

00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:07,963
No, because that's
where he really lived.

00:26:08,598 --> 00:26:11,303
I used to stay up
late drawing.

00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,975
And Carlo would be asleep.

00:26:13,975 --> 00:26:16,146
My dad would come in
and grab me,

00:26:16,146 --> 00:26:20,054
and... and we'd go for a ride.

00:26:20,054 --> 00:26:21,089
<i>Just the two of us.</i>

00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:24,029
Will you buy me a car like this
when I'm grown-up, Daddy?

00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:26,233
I'll get you 20
of them, Aron.

00:26:26,233 --> 00:26:27,970
Sky's the limit, kid.

00:26:30,307 --> 00:26:34,282
Aron, were you with your father
the night he was murdered?

00:26:34,282 --> 00:26:36,119
It was our last ride together.

00:26:36,854 --> 00:26:38,992
He, uh, dropped me off
at a diner.

00:26:39,225 --> 00:26:43,100
Said he'd be back in an hour.

00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:43,635
I mean, I know

00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:48,010
my dad wasn't a saint,
but he was good to me.

00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,780
What about Carlo?

00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,686
They fought.

00:26:52,686 --> 00:26:54,289
They were too much alike.

00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:56,326
That's how I know
he stole it.

00:26:56,326 --> 00:27:00,367
He's stealing from the house--
he learned that from my dad.

00:27:10,722 --> 00:27:14,195
"Do you want to drive the car
where 'The Vise' was murdered?"

00:27:14,195 --> 00:27:16,601
Yeah, not so much.

00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,671
Well, someone wanted
to drive that car.

00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:20,174
Where'd
you find this?

00:27:20,174 --> 00:27:22,011
Carlo Derosa
posted it

00:27:22,011 --> 00:27:23,147
a week ago

00:27:23,147 --> 00:27:25,852
on Farringer's car
auction Web site.

00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,923
According to Carlo's
bank records,

00:27:27,923 --> 00:27:31,196
an anonymous buyer put down
$100,000 on the car.

00:27:31,196 --> 00:27:34,737
But we know that brother
Aron stopped the sale.

00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:37,910
Yes, but there's no indication
that Carlo returned the deposit.

00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:40,816
Suggesting that he hadn't given
up on the idea of selling it.

00:27:40,816 --> 00:27:42,285
So, where are we?
We got one brother

00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,422
who's willing to steal
the car to sell it,

00:27:44,422 --> 00:27:47,094
the other one willing
to steal it to protect it.

00:27:47,094 --> 00:27:49,032
So which
brother did it?

00:27:49,032 --> 00:27:50,301
I don't think it was
either one of them.

00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:52,806
You remember the shoe impression
we found at the scene?

00:27:52,806 --> 00:27:53,273
Yeah.

00:27:53,273 --> 00:27:55,846
We compared it to all
the shoes the brothers owned,

00:27:55,846 --> 00:27:57,048
and we did not get a match.

00:27:57,048 --> 00:27:59,152
Doesn't mean that the
shoes weren't thrown away.

00:27:59,152 --> 00:28:00,054
That's true.

00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:02,759
But it's also true that we could
be looking for somebody else.

00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:04,697
A scorned buyer, perhaps.

00:28:04,697 --> 00:28:07,068
Okay, so a buyer's
interested in the Mob car,

00:28:07,068 --> 00:28:09,372
maybe uses Mob
tactics to get it.

00:28:09,372 --> 00:28:12,044
Any luck on following
the money trail?

00:28:12,044 --> 00:28:14,449
No, it all leads
to offshore accounts.

00:28:14,449 --> 00:28:15,986
And no names.

00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:18,290
But I will keep
working on it.

00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,029
How come you know so
much about classic cars?

00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:23,100
Cute guy in shop class.

00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,002
No, seriously.

00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:28,410
Actually, uh, my brother owned
a '57 Chevy rust bucket.

00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,247
Left it in the garage
when he went to college.

00:28:30,247 --> 00:28:31,182
Totally forgot
about it.

00:28:31,182 --> 00:28:33,186
And then, when I got
a little older,

00:28:33,186 --> 00:28:35,391
I needed a way
to get to school, so...

00:28:35,391 --> 00:28:36,894
You fixed it up.

00:28:36,894 --> 00:28:38,363
Took the engine
completely apart

00:28:38,363 --> 00:28:40,367
and reassembled it
piece by piece.

00:28:40,367 --> 00:28:42,138
I found it really
interesting

00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,208
to see how it all connected.

00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:47,248
Carburetor as crime scene.

00:28:47,248 --> 00:28:50,454
Yeah, it's all in the details.

00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:01,409
I can't believe this backseat.

00:29:01,409 --> 00:29:03,881
You could have
a picnic in there.

00:29:03,881 --> 00:29:06,954
I think Alfonz and his mistress
were up to more than that.

00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,958
Talk about a last ride.

00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:09,727
(chuckles)

00:29:12,298 --> 00:29:14,135
BRODY: I think
I may have found something

00:29:14,135 --> 00:29:15,805
from our killer's last ride.

00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:17,743
Some sort of fiber.

00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,373
I think I found
a chrome flake, too.

00:29:33,373 --> 00:29:34,943
Could be from
our Silver Woman.

00:29:34,943 --> 00:29:37,081
We know this car was used
for the body dump.

00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:39,085
Maybe she was transported
in the trunk.

00:29:39,085 --> 00:29:40,387
You look in there yet?

00:29:40,387 --> 00:29:43,060
Nope.

00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,462
Let's check it out.

00:29:51,176 --> 00:29:52,411
Oh.

00:29:52,411 --> 00:29:55,217
A tarp with chrome
paint and blood.

00:29:55,217 --> 00:29:56,419
Confirms that theory.

00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,789
Yep.

00:30:00,795 --> 00:30:02,465
Ooh, what's that?

00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:07,141
A copy of Ken Bixler's
appraisal of this car.

00:30:07,141 --> 00:30:10,080
Looks like it was printed
from the Farringer Web site.

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,420
Well, maybe this printout
will give us a print.

00:30:19,198 --> 00:30:20,835
I got a partial.

00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,941
Not sure if it'll be enough
for AFIS, though.

00:30:23,941 --> 00:30:24,943
Well, then, let's hope

00:30:24,943 --> 00:30:28,083
that our mystery buyer left
some epithelials behind.

00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,564
Find anything?

00:30:35,564 --> 00:30:37,234
Hey, Morgan,
what do you got?

00:30:37,234 --> 00:30:40,841
I just got results on the touch
DNA from the appraisal report.

00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:42,478
So who's the buyer
of the Cadillac?

00:30:42,478 --> 00:30:45,083
Results come back as a
female familial match

00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:46,186
to Ava Montrose.

00:30:46,186 --> 00:30:48,891
And she doesn't have any
sisters or daughters.

00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:50,260
That just leaves
her mother.

00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,298
Ruth Montrose.

00:30:52,298 --> 00:30:54,903
Ruth Montrose is our buyer.

00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:57,141
And if our theory is correct,
she's not just our buyer;

00:30:57,141 --> 00:30:58,945
she's our killer.

00:31:03,253 --> 00:31:05,490
You must help me get this car.

00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,394
Don't "must" me, Mother.

00:31:07,394 --> 00:31:09,265
This fiasco's all yours,

00:31:09,265 --> 00:31:10,133
not mine.

00:31:10,133 --> 00:31:13,240
Darling, I have borrowed
a lot of money

00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,043
from some very
disreputable men.

00:31:15,043 --> 00:31:17,514
If I don't pay them, Lord knows
what's going to happen to me.

00:31:17,514 --> 00:31:19,118
Do you understand?

00:31:19,118 --> 00:31:21,522
I understand perfectly.

00:31:21,522 --> 00:31:23,260
You need me.

00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,032
I have never asked you
for anything.

00:31:26,366 --> 00:31:29,272
SIDLE:
<i>So you admit to using</i>
<i>your own daughter</i>

00:31:29,272 --> 00:31:30,574
to help steal a car.

00:31:30,574 --> 00:31:32,878
Ava knew how to get
into the vault.

00:31:32,878 --> 00:31:35,917
It's appalling, I know.

00:31:35,917 --> 00:31:38,223
I can't argue with that.

00:31:38,223 --> 00:31:40,494
Why did you need
to buy the car so badly?

00:31:40,494 --> 00:31:41,896
I wasn't the buyer.

00:31:41,896 --> 00:31:42,999
I was just an intermediary

00:31:42,999 --> 00:31:44,902
for a wealthy gentleman
from Dubai.

00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:47,107
I met him at a party
a month ago.

00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:49,211
He loves Mob lore and cars.

00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:52,117
I told him that Alfonz Derosa's
death car was for sale.

00:31:52,117 --> 00:31:53,253
And he was interested?

00:31:53,253 --> 00:31:54,388
He was ready to pay two million

00:31:54,388 --> 00:31:55,590
when he came back from Dubai.

00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,528
Double the appraisal,
double the purchase price.

00:31:57,528 --> 00:31:59,932
That's not a bad profit.

00:31:59,932 --> 00:32:01,235
So, you borrowed the money

00:32:01,235 --> 00:32:03,440
from a loan shark
to make the deposit.

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,041
Yes.

00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:06,312
And then that sentimental fool,

00:32:06,312 --> 00:32:08,416
Aron Derosa, canceled the sale.

00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:10,420
And that's when your problems
really started.

00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:14,462
What happened to Ava
in that vault?

00:32:14,462 --> 00:32:15,497
(chuckles)

00:32:15,497 --> 00:32:18,403
I have no idea.

00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,273
Yeah, see, I thought
we were getting somewhere.

00:32:20,273 --> 00:32:22,478
I wasn't there.

00:32:22,478 --> 00:32:24,181
I would never murder
my own daughter.

00:32:24,181 --> 00:32:25,650
I wish I could believe
that, Ms. Montrose.

00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,154
I've seen a lot over the years.

00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,458
Nothing surprises me.

00:32:29,492 --> 00:32:33,199
Believe what you will.

00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:35,704
I think Ava brought
an unsavory friend to help her.

00:32:36,406 --> 00:32:39,645
And then something
went terribly wrong.

00:32:40,213 --> 00:32:41,516
RUSSELL:
<i>Well, she's not gonna win</i>

00:32:41,516 --> 00:32:43,153
mother of the year awards.

00:32:43,153 --> 00:32:45,390
But would she kill
her own daughter?

00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,526
You believe her story?

00:32:46,526 --> 00:32:48,596
Well, I think there's
a pragmatic woman

00:32:48,596 --> 00:32:49,698
under all that crazy,
(phone chirps)

00:32:49,698 --> 00:32:51,936
and her daughter's more
valuable alive than dead.

00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:55,075
Mmm. Greg wants to know
if I feel like

00:32:55,075 --> 00:32:57,648
taking a ride back to the past.

00:32:58,583 --> 00:33:00,587
Boy, this looks like
it could all be part

00:33:00,587 --> 00:33:02,324
of a new edition for your book.

00:33:02,324 --> 00:33:03,259
Could be.

00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:04,528
But I also think it relates

00:33:04,528 --> 00:33:06,132
to Ava Montrose's murder.

00:33:06,132 --> 00:33:08,169
This is Pete Bamonte.

00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:11,275
Chicago loan shark and the guy
behind Alfonz Derosa's murder.

00:33:11,275 --> 00:33:13,011
Right, he hired the
hit man to do it.

00:33:13,011 --> 00:33:15,450
When I was researching
the Derosa murder from '89,

00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:18,055
I discovered
that Bamonte had a son.

00:33:18,055 --> 00:33:19,458
Bamonte got divorced.

00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:21,061
His wife remarried,
and then his son

00:33:21,061 --> 00:33:23,666
took his stepfather's last name,
which was Reidel.

00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:26,706
Reidel, as in Duncan Reidel?

00:33:26,706 --> 00:33:29,178
<i>Ruth Montrose's boyfriend</i>

00:33:29,178 --> 00:33:31,349
is Pete Bamonte's son?

00:33:31,349 --> 00:33:33,353
I'm saying maybe
we have a new suspect,

00:33:33,353 --> 00:33:36,659
and maybe Ruth Montrose's story
about a buyer in Dubai

00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:38,296
was just a story.

00:33:38,296 --> 00:33:41,101
And the real buyer
is a little closer to home.

00:33:41,101 --> 00:33:42,404
Okay, so where's our proof?

00:33:42,404 --> 00:33:44,040
How are we doing
with the, uh,

00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,510
trace that we got
from the Caddy?

00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,612
Finn's working on it.

00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,791
Where you headed?

00:33:53,058 --> 00:33:55,330
I'm not sure.

00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,699
So, if you're right

00:33:56,699 --> 00:33:58,201
and Duncan Reidel is the killer,

00:33:58,201 --> 00:34:00,273
then he must have done
restoration work

00:34:00,273 --> 00:34:02,109
before he killed Ava.

00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:03,011
What do you mean?

00:34:03,011 --> 00:34:04,047
Well, I got the results back

00:34:04,047 --> 00:34:06,686
from the fiber that we found
on the passenger seat.

00:34:06,686 --> 00:34:08,456
Cannabis sativa.

00:34:08,456 --> 00:34:09,157
Hemp.

00:34:09,157 --> 00:34:10,560
It's used for
upholstery stuffing.

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,397
And the thing I know
about classic cars

00:34:12,397 --> 00:34:14,535
is they did not use hemp
in the carpet

00:34:14,535 --> 00:34:15,804
or in the seat lining.

00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,641
Not in 1976, anyway.

00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:20,413
Also, check out the result
on the chrome.

00:34:20,814 --> 00:34:23,286
It's not chromic
potassium sulfate.

00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:24,555
It didn't come off the girl.

00:34:24,555 --> 00:34:26,792
It must have flaked
off the car.

00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:28,529
But on what part of the car?

00:34:28,529 --> 00:34:30,165
Yeah, that is
what I am trying

00:34:30,165 --> 00:34:32,036
to figure out.

00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:36,412
Well, we found both
pieces of trace here,

00:34:36,412 --> 00:34:39,117
near the passenger seat.

00:34:44,795 --> 00:34:46,766
The chrome on the
headrest post is flaking.

00:34:46,766 --> 00:34:48,135
Someone messed with it.

00:34:48,135 --> 00:34:49,170
Maybe the killer

00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,141
swapped out
the original headrest

00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:53,346
with a new one,
reupholstered with hemp.

00:34:53,346 --> 00:34:55,550
There's one way to know
for sure.

00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,253
After Alfonz and
his mistress

00:34:57,253 --> 00:34:58,088
were shot,

00:34:58,088 --> 00:35:01,495
this entire seat
was covered in blood.

00:35:09,143 --> 00:35:10,079
When is the last time

00:35:10,245 --> 00:35:12,183
someone was shot
in the head in a car

00:35:12,183 --> 00:35:14,354
and didn't leave any
blood on the headrest?

00:35:14,354 --> 00:35:16,324
How about never?

00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:19,297
So, Ava's killer
replaced the headrest.

00:35:19,297 --> 00:35:21,635
The question is: Why?

00:35:21,635 --> 00:35:23,138
SANDERS:
<i>The hit man who went to prison</i>

00:35:23,138 --> 00:35:25,443
<i>for the murder of Alfonz Derosa</i>

00:35:25,443 --> 00:35:27,581
wasn't convicted on evidence.

00:35:27,581 --> 00:35:30,152
He was convicted on the word
of a jailhouse snitch.

00:35:30,152 --> 00:35:31,388
So you're thinking
he was set up?

00:35:31,388 --> 00:35:32,457
Yeah, maybe there was

00:35:32,457 --> 00:35:34,495
a different shooter,
someone closer to the guy

00:35:34,495 --> 00:35:35,430
who ordered the hit.

00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,565
In 1989,

00:35:36,565 --> 00:35:39,270
Duncan Reidel was 18 years old.

00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,406
So, Duncan could've

00:35:40,406 --> 00:35:42,276
been the one to pull the trigger
for his father.

00:35:42,276 --> 00:35:44,681
And maybe there was something
in that headrest

00:35:44,681 --> 00:35:46,351
that could've proven it.

00:35:46,351 --> 00:35:47,420
Like a bullet.

00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,756
Exactly.
So let's see

00:35:48,756 --> 00:35:50,593
if there's something
on this headrest

00:35:50,593 --> 00:35:53,633
that will help us
make our case today.

00:35:56,605 --> 00:36:25,262
♪ ♪

00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:27,824
SANDERS:
Hey.

00:36:27,824 --> 00:36:30,239
Did you get an I.D.
off the headrest?
Yeah, I did.

00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:31,876
Not who we expected.

00:36:31,876 --> 00:36:33,646
Reidel's off the hook.

00:36:33,646 --> 00:36:34,882
So who is it?

00:36:34,882 --> 00:36:36,384
RUSSELL:
You know, it's interesting,

00:36:36,384 --> 00:36:38,388
what a car means
to different people.

00:36:38,388 --> 00:36:40,225
You take this Cadillac.

00:36:40,225 --> 00:36:41,929
To Carlo Derosa,

00:36:41,929 --> 00:36:44,534
it means revenge.

00:36:44,534 --> 00:36:46,572
Selling it's a great way
to get back at a father

00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:49,210
who cared more about his
cars than about him.

00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,580
Yeah, to Aron Derosa,
keeping it

00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,216
is a way of remembering
that father.

00:36:52,216 --> 00:36:53,686
To him, the car means love.

00:36:53,686 --> 00:36:56,324
Right, we-we were
just wondering...

00:36:56,324 --> 00:36:57,894
What did it mean to you?

00:37:00,332 --> 00:37:02,804
Mr. Bixler?

00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,910
Um... (chuckles) nothing.

00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,948
I mean, I mean,
not a damn thing.

00:37:07,948 --> 00:37:09,885
It was just a part of my job.

00:37:09,885 --> 00:37:10,987
Wrong answer, Ken.

00:37:10,987 --> 00:37:13,491
Yeah, we-we kind of
figured that, to you,

00:37:13,491 --> 00:37:17,232
the car means heartbreak.

00:37:17,232 --> 00:37:18,335
Heartbreak?

00:37:18,335 --> 00:37:20,740
I... What are you talking about?

00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,441
You see, Ken,

00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:25,349
we found your DNA
on the passenger side headrest.

00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:28,254
Well, uh, I inspected
that headrest, so...

00:37:28,254 --> 00:37:31,996
No, actually, the headrest you
inspected was the old headrest.

00:37:31,996 --> 00:37:33,331
The manufactured one.

00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:35,402
We're talking
about the new headrest.

00:37:35,402 --> 00:37:36,638
And that's because
you replaced it.

00:37:36,638 --> 00:37:38,776
We, uh, recovered the old
headrest in the Dumpster

00:37:38,776 --> 00:37:41,715
behind your appraisal office,
and your prints were on that.

00:37:41,715 --> 00:37:44,988
We also found an expended bullet
that was a direct match

00:37:44,988 --> 00:37:48,829
to a Beretta manufactured
in 1980.

00:37:48,829 --> 00:37:50,332
Your Beretta.

00:37:50,332 --> 00:37:51,769
It's the same
gun you fired

00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,304
last year when you
thought an intruder

00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:54,640
was breaking into your house.

00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,411
RUSSELL:
Remember, the cops
were called?

00:37:56,411 --> 00:37:57,379
The bullet and the gun

00:37:57,379 --> 00:37:59,617
were processed and then put
in the system.

00:37:59,617 --> 00:38:02,256
And it's also the same gun
that was used

00:38:02,256 --> 00:38:03,926
to murder Alfonz Derosa.

00:38:03,926 --> 00:38:05,997
Yeah, unfortunately, though...
The recovered bullets

00:38:05,997 --> 00:38:07,867
were too degraded
to process.

00:38:07,867 --> 00:38:10,272
Right, but in the cops' defense,

00:38:10,272 --> 00:38:14,881
they didn't realize that you
fired three shots, not two.

00:38:14,881 --> 00:38:15,783
A stray round

00:38:15,783 --> 00:38:17,453
going into the headrest.

00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:20,292
(laughter)

00:38:29,845 --> 00:38:30,445
The cops thought

00:38:30,445 --> 00:38:31,915
it was a professional hit.

00:38:31,915 --> 00:38:34,888
They didn't realize it was just
an enraged car salesman

00:38:34,888 --> 00:38:36,925
with a shaky hand.

00:38:36,925 --> 00:38:38,929
What I don't understand is:
Why'd you feel like you had

00:38:38,929 --> 00:38:40,332
to kill him in the first place?

00:38:40,332 --> 00:38:41,400
You barely knew the guy.

00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:45,943
I wasn't there to kill Alfonz.

00:38:45,943 --> 00:38:48,081
I was there to kill Vera.

00:38:48,081 --> 00:38:49,450
Vera Scanell.

00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:50,585
Alfonz's mistress.

00:38:50,585 --> 00:38:51,347
My fiancée.

00:38:52,757 --> 00:38:54,828
What a beautiful wreck she was.

00:38:54,828 --> 00:38:57,967
She never cared
how much pain she caused me.

00:38:57,967 --> 00:39:00,372
The humiliation.

00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:00,806
They both got

00:39:00,806 --> 00:39:02,075
what was coming to them.

00:39:02,075 --> 00:39:03,846
I didn't regret it for a second.

00:39:03,846 --> 00:39:05,816
Until 30 years later
when you realized

00:39:05,816 --> 00:39:09,056
that you left
some evidence behind.

00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,824
Ken,

00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,895
what about Ava?

00:39:11,895 --> 00:39:13,565
How'd she play into this?

00:39:13,565 --> 00:39:15,535
I've known her for years.

00:39:15,535 --> 00:39:17,372
I was friends with her dealer.

00:39:17,372 --> 00:39:19,577
I used to help him
launder money.

00:39:19,577 --> 00:39:21,614
She came to me about a week ago,

00:39:21,614 --> 00:39:25,555
telling me about her mom's plan
to steal the car.

00:39:25,555 --> 00:39:27,693
They wanted help getting it
out of the country.

00:39:27,693 --> 00:39:29,563
But with the car
being sold, you were worried

00:39:29,563 --> 00:39:31,567
that the bullet in the headrest
would be discovered

00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:34,106
and finally matched
to your Beretta.

00:39:34,106 --> 00:39:37,446
I had to get it out.

00:39:37,446 --> 00:39:39,851
I sent her away.

00:39:39,851 --> 00:39:42,055
I sent her away
for an hour or so

00:39:42,055 --> 00:39:44,995
so I could get
my work done.

00:39:45,428 --> 00:39:46,764
Too bad she had to come back.

00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,509
The vibe in this place
always gets me feeling hot.

00:39:52,509 --> 00:39:53,979
Sexy.

00:39:53,979 --> 00:39:55,148
Do you want to take a ride?

00:39:55,148 --> 00:39:56,684
The hell you doing here?

00:39:56,684 --> 00:39:58,889
I got bored. Let's go.

00:39:58,889 --> 00:39:59,823
Now.

00:39:59,823 --> 00:40:01,427
The car's not ready yet.

00:40:01,427 --> 00:40:04,667
I thought you said you were
working on the engine.

00:40:05,735 --> 00:40:08,508
What are you up to, Kenny boy?

00:40:08,508 --> 00:40:10,578
You got an angle, don't you?

00:40:10,578 --> 00:40:13,117
What is it? I want in.
Stay out of it, Ava.

00:40:13,117 --> 00:40:14,787
(laughs)

00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,457
Now I know it's good.

00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:19,430
You want me to stay out of it,
it's gonna cost...

00:40:23,071 --> 00:40:25,075
I told you to stay
the hell out of here!

00:40:25,075 --> 00:40:25,943
Come here!
Get back!

00:40:25,943 --> 00:40:28,481
Come back! (grunts)

00:40:28,481 --> 00:40:32,122
(grunting and groaning)

00:40:32,122 --> 00:40:33,658
Come here. Come on!

00:41:00,945 --> 00:41:02,649
Just talked to Carlo Derosa.

00:41:02,649 --> 00:41:05,488
He's sending someone over
to pick up the Caddy.

00:41:05,488 --> 00:41:06,569
Well, Bixler did confess,

00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:09,272
so the car's not
evidence anymore.

00:41:09,272 --> 00:41:10,806
What about Aron Derosa?

00:41:10,806 --> 00:41:12,275
Still doesn't want to sell?

00:41:12,275 --> 00:41:14,410
Actually, the brothers
finally compromised.

00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:16,946
They're donating the car
to the Mob Museum.

00:41:16,946 --> 00:41:19,348
Oh, that sounds like
a good place for her.

00:41:19,348 --> 00:41:24,187
Still such a shame that she's
never gonna see the road again.

00:41:26,856 --> 00:41:28,357
One last ride?

00:41:28,357 --> 00:41:30,459
I thought you'd never ask.
