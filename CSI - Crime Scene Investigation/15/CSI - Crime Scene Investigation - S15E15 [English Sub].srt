00:00:00,906 --> 00:00:02,874
(dog barks in distance,
bottle clattering)

00:00:02,874 --> 00:00:07,879
(siren wails in distance)

00:00:09,948 --> 00:00:11,183
(liquid sloshing)

00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:21,426
(bottle clattering)

00:00:21,426 --> 00:00:23,428
(man chuckling evilly)

00:00:23,428 --> 00:00:25,197
(gasps)

00:00:25,731 --> 00:00:26,798
Hey, old man.

00:00:26,798 --> 00:00:28,567
What the hell
are you doing in my alley?

00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:31,403
This... this isn't your alley.

00:00:31,403 --> 00:00:33,305
What, you trying to tell
me that it's yours?

00:00:33,305 --> 00:00:34,539
Why are you doing this?

00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:35,941
THUG 2:
I'm just trying
to have some fun.

00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:37,576
Ain't you having fun?

00:00:37,576 --> 00:00:39,678
(others laughing)

00:00:39,678 --> 00:00:41,913
(grunting)

00:00:41,913 --> 00:00:44,182
Please, just let me be, please.

00:00:44,182 --> 00:00:45,183
Is that the best you got?

00:00:45,183 --> 00:00:46,318
(cries out)

00:00:46,318 --> 00:00:47,586
(grunts, sobs)

00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:50,889
(whimpers)

00:00:52,724 --> 00:00:54,426
MAN:
Leave him alone!

00:00:55,627 --> 00:00:56,762
Who's there?

00:00:56,762 --> 00:00:58,764
Get that damn light
out of my eyes.

00:00:58,764 --> 00:00:59,965
MAN:
You want to pick on someone?

00:00:59,965 --> 00:01:01,933
Why don't
you pick on

00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:03,368
someone who can
fight back?

00:01:03,368 --> 00:01:04,936
I said, turn off
that damn light.

00:01:04,936 --> 00:01:06,338
Forget it, man.

00:01:08,173 --> 00:01:09,241
Who the hell are you?

00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:10,242
I'm a guy who's sick of you

00:01:10,242 --> 00:01:11,777
trashing this neighborhood.

00:01:11,777 --> 00:01:14,212
THUG:
Well, if you're gonna
do something about it,

00:01:14,212 --> 00:01:15,881
why don't you hurry up
and do it?

00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:18,183
(crackling)

00:01:18,183 --> 00:01:19,551
Let's go.

00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:21,920
(whimpering)

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,221
(indistinct shouting)

00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:24,723
(siren wails)

00:01:24,723 --> 00:01:26,224
Thank you.
Morning.
MITCHELL: Morning.

00:01:26,224 --> 00:01:27,459
STOKES:
What's going on, Mitch?

00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:28,460
MITCHELL:
One of the owners

00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,795
who backs on the alley

00:01:29,795 --> 00:01:31,463
was taking out trash
this morning.

00:01:31,463 --> 00:01:33,331
He made the find.

00:01:36,935 --> 00:01:38,937
Oof.

00:01:43,842 --> 00:01:45,944
Somebody worked him over
pretty good.

00:01:45,944 --> 00:01:48,446
Judging by his knuckles,

00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:50,182
I'd say he got a few shots in.

00:01:51,516 --> 00:01:53,718
SIDLE:
Eh.

00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:56,855
Ground is sticky over here,

00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:59,324
probably thanks
to this Dumpster.

00:01:59,324 --> 00:02:01,593
But it's given us
a lot of shoe impressions.

00:02:01,593 --> 00:02:02,661
Looking at the number,

00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:04,963
I'd say more
than one assailant.

00:02:04,963 --> 00:02:06,965
Well, Mitch did say
there was a gang

00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:09,201
terrorizing
the neighborhood lately.

00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:11,503
Mostly vandalism
and burglaries,

00:02:11,503 --> 00:02:13,505
but maybe they stepped up
their game to murder.

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,945
Nice get-up.

00:02:19,945 --> 00:02:21,313
Is that a cape?

00:02:21,313 --> 00:02:23,515
That's a costume of some sort.

00:02:23,515 --> 00:02:26,952
And, of course,
no costume

00:02:26,952 --> 00:02:29,187
would be complete
without a mask.

00:02:29,187 --> 00:02:30,522
SIDLE:
Maybe he was one of those

00:02:30,522 --> 00:02:32,557
sidewalk characters
over on the Strip.

00:02:32,557 --> 00:02:34,960
They dress up like superheroes
and panhandle for money.

00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,662
Yeah, and was walking home
and just got jumped?

00:02:37,662 --> 00:02:38,897
Sara.
SIDLE:
Mmm?

00:02:38,897 --> 00:02:39,965
One of my guys

00:02:39,965 --> 00:02:41,933
found this in a doorway
up the street.

00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:43,301
No ID.

00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:44,870
Looks like it's
been rifled through.

00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,605
Got some street
clothes...

00:02:46,605 --> 00:02:47,906
and a sketch pad.

00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:53,912
Uh...

00:02:53,912 --> 00:02:55,847
Nick?
STOKES:
Yeah.

00:02:55,847 --> 00:02:57,916
Take a look at these.

00:02:59,784 --> 00:03:02,621
STOKES:
Comic drawings
of a superhero.

00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:05,891
That's <i>this</i> superhero.

00:03:07,492 --> 00:03:09,227
Battling a gang.

00:03:09,227 --> 00:03:11,196
It's a little weirdly
prophetic, isn't it?

00:03:11,196 --> 00:03:12,864
Like he knew
he was gonna

00:03:12,864 --> 00:03:14,966
come up against
these guys.

00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:16,401
Like he knew the future.

00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:18,236
Too bad for him,

00:03:18,236 --> 00:03:20,639
the hero only wins
in comic books.

Hey, uh, quite a
collection of lifts.

00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:03,891
SIDLE: Yeah, looks like
at least five or six

00:04:03,891 --> 00:04:05,960
different individuals,
plus the victim.

00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,696
And a bare foot?
What's with that?
I don't know,

00:04:08,696 --> 00:04:10,298
but he was definitely
part of the mix somehow.

00:04:10,298 --> 00:04:11,299
What do you got?

00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:12,367
I think these are

00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:14,135
the victim's superpowers.

00:04:14,135 --> 00:04:16,738
One stun gun, spent,
no charge left,

00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:18,306
and a pepper spray...

00:04:18,306 --> 00:04:19,841
(rattling)

00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:21,642
...also empty.

00:04:21,642 --> 00:04:23,878
PHILLIPS: Hey, Nick.
Got a minute?

00:04:24,145 --> 00:04:25,079
What's up, Super Dave?

00:04:25,246 --> 00:04:26,914
Well, I'm gonna
say time of death

00:04:26,914 --> 00:04:29,283
was between midnight
and 3:00 a.m.

00:04:29,283 --> 00:04:31,352
Multiple bruises and contusions.

00:04:31,352 --> 00:04:33,287
Several lacerations.

00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:34,288
I can't hazard a guess

00:04:34,288 --> 00:04:36,124
to say which ultimately
killed him, though.

00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:37,892
Find any ID?

00:04:37,892 --> 00:04:39,293
No. Nothing.

00:04:39,293 --> 00:04:42,263
Leave it to a superhero
to keep his identity a mystery.

00:04:42,263 --> 00:04:43,264
MAN:
Can I get my cart, please?

00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,368
MAN:
Can I get my cart?

00:04:47,368 --> 00:04:50,605
OFFICER:
I said, be patient, okay?

00:04:50,605 --> 00:04:52,607
Please.

00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:58,613
Mmm. Mmm.

00:04:58,613 --> 00:05:02,283
Mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:05:02,283 --> 00:05:04,652
How's your sandwich, Roger?

00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:05,820
Oh...

00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,655
Good, yes.
Thanks.

00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:09,323
You said size 11.

00:05:09,323 --> 00:05:11,192
They're not entirely new.

00:05:11,192 --> 00:05:13,094
They're from our lost-and-found,
but they're something.

00:05:13,094 --> 00:05:14,228
Thank you.
You're welcome.

00:05:17,632 --> 00:05:20,034
They're, uh...
not entirely free,

00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:21,335
though, either.

00:05:21,335 --> 00:05:22,370
I need to know

00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,806
what happened in
the alley last night.

00:05:24,806 --> 00:05:26,040
You were there,

00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,275
weren't you?

00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:29,710
Some guy...

00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,079
who looked like Batman...

00:05:34,282 --> 00:05:36,717
...he saved me.

00:05:36,717 --> 00:05:37,952
How did he save you, exactly?

00:05:37,952 --> 00:05:39,086
I was,

00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:41,255
uh, rummaging.

00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:43,224
All of a sudden,

00:05:43,224 --> 00:05:46,761
I'm surrounded by these, um...
villains.

00:05:46,761 --> 00:05:49,797
And they start shoving
and hitting me.

00:05:49,797 --> 00:05:51,199
What did these villains
look like?

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,266
Never saw them.

00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:54,735
They-they covered their faces.

00:05:54,735 --> 00:05:56,304
But they

00:05:56,304 --> 00:05:59,207
wanted to hurt me.

00:05:59,207 --> 00:06:01,008
Badly.

00:06:03,277 --> 00:06:07,849
That's when the guy
in the mask appeared,

00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:09,150
in a ball of light.

00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,351
I see.

00:06:10,351 --> 00:06:12,653
What happened next?

00:06:12,653 --> 00:06:13,888
I don't... I don't know.

00:06:13,888 --> 00:06:15,223
I left. I took off.

00:06:15,223 --> 00:06:17,658
You didn't see their faces.

00:06:17,658 --> 00:06:19,026
You didn't see what happened.

00:06:19,026 --> 00:06:20,795
Did you see anything at all

00:06:20,795 --> 00:06:23,064
that-that might help us?

00:06:23,064 --> 00:06:25,266
Find the villains, I mean.

00:06:25,266 --> 00:06:27,869
A truck.

00:06:29,303 --> 00:06:31,005
A red pickup.

00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:32,773
Um, parked in the alley.

00:06:36,911 --> 00:06:38,913
RUSSELL:
How's it going?

00:06:38,913 --> 00:06:40,014
Any luck?

00:06:40,014 --> 00:06:41,215
Some.

00:06:41,215 --> 00:06:43,184
I was able to identify
two of the boots

00:06:43,184 --> 00:06:44,785
that made these
impressions.

00:06:44,785 --> 00:06:45,786
Unfortunately,

00:06:45,786 --> 00:06:47,288
they're all common work boots,

00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:50,258
sold at dozens of retailers
and online.

00:06:50,258 --> 00:06:52,360
But we may have some luck
in a different way.

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,328
Take a
close look.

00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:57,064
RUSSELL: There are granules
stuck in the gel.

00:06:57,064 --> 00:06:59,100
Almost like... coffee grounds.

00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,769
Sara said that the ground

00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:04,238
around the crime scene was...
was sticky.

00:07:04,238 --> 00:07:06,374
Maybe the tackiness
pulled whatever this is

00:07:06,374 --> 00:07:07,275
off of this guy's shoes.

00:07:07,275 --> 00:07:08,376
Not just his.

00:07:08,376 --> 00:07:11,212
Almost all of these have
the exact same trace on them.

00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:11,946
I already pulled

00:07:11,946 --> 00:07:14,081
a sample and gave it
to Hodges for analysis.

00:07:14,081 --> 00:07:16,284
Hey, Russell,
you should, uh, see this.

00:07:16,284 --> 00:07:17,785
It's, uh, security footage

00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:19,687
from a pawnshop on Wallace.

00:07:19,687 --> 00:07:21,355
Just a few blocks
from the murder.

00:07:30,197 --> 00:07:33,334
Wow, they don't waste any time.

00:07:33,334 --> 00:07:34,635
That's from
a little after 11:00.

00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:36,971
Only an hour or so
before the murder.

00:07:36,971 --> 00:07:40,041
Looks like this gang
had a busy night.

00:07:44,345 --> 00:07:46,013
FINLAY: The owner already
started cleaning up inside.

00:07:46,013 --> 00:07:47,348
So I told him
not to touch anything

00:07:47,348 --> 00:07:49,584
until we're finished.

00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:51,319
SANDERS:
Well, according to Akers,

00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:53,888
this is the second time
these guys have hit this place.

00:07:53,888 --> 00:07:56,857
They did the same thing
to a beauty supply store

00:07:56,857 --> 00:07:58,025
a block down, a
couple nights ago.

00:07:58,025 --> 00:07:59,327
So they're targeting
the same area.

00:07:59,327 --> 00:08:01,362
Gotta be local.

00:08:01,362 --> 00:08:02,697
Maybe a gang

00:08:02,697 --> 00:08:04,298
of neighborhood kids
out wilding?

00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:06,334
Wilding... now killing.

00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:07,735
Got any shoe impressions?

00:08:09,303 --> 00:08:10,805
SANDERS:
Working on it.

00:08:10,805 --> 00:08:11,305
FINLAY:
What is that powder?

00:08:11,305 --> 00:08:13,608
Oh, the, uh, display

00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:15,242
has fluorescent lights.

00:08:15,242 --> 00:08:16,210
And the inside of the tubes

00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,245
is coated with
this phosphor powder.

00:08:18,245 --> 00:08:20,715
When the tube breaks,
the powder gets everywhere.

00:08:20,715 --> 00:08:21,816
FINLAY:
Any point in, uh...

00:08:21,816 --> 00:08:23,651
dusting for prints?
Not sure.

00:08:23,651 --> 00:08:24,852
Video was pretty grainy,

00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:26,287
but it looked like
they were wearing gloves.

00:08:26,287 --> 00:08:29,090
Besides, they took almost
everything they touched.

00:08:33,127 --> 00:08:34,729
Maybe we don't need any prints.

00:08:42,603 --> 00:08:44,605
I got blood.

00:08:50,645 --> 00:08:52,613
"I wear a mask.

00:08:52,613 --> 00:08:55,349
"And that mask,
it's not to hide who I am,

00:08:55,349 --> 00:08:57,685
but to create what I am."

00:08:57,685 --> 00:08:58,886
I give up.

00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:00,321
Are-are you
quoting Sun Tzu?

00:09:00,321 --> 00:09:02,356
Uh, no, no, no.
A different warrior.

00:09:02,757 --> 00:09:04,625
Batman. Volume one.

00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,161
Number 624.

00:09:07,161 --> 00:09:08,329
What're you doing?

00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:10,731
Oh, I'm just trying
to see your feet.

00:09:10,731 --> 00:09:12,066
The last Batman fan I met

00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:13,334
was shoeless
and lives in an alley.

00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:14,702
You know,
I never

00:09:14,702 --> 00:09:15,202
pegged you

00:09:15,202 --> 00:09:17,805
for a comic book nerd.
My early teens,

00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:20,241
every dime I had
went to comic books.

00:09:20,241 --> 00:09:21,742
I guess I just don't
get it. You know?

00:09:21,742 --> 00:09:24,245
My childhood, fantasy
was never my escape.

00:09:24,245 --> 00:09:26,280
I lost myself
in science and numbers.

00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,182
That's all I needed, I guess.

00:09:28,182 --> 00:09:31,018
Well, you liked things
that were clear and proven.

00:09:31,018 --> 00:09:32,186
Right or wrong.

00:09:32,186 --> 00:09:34,855
Black or white.
Maybe.

00:09:34,855 --> 00:09:35,856
This is the closest
that I've come

00:09:35,856 --> 00:09:36,991
to the comic book world,

00:09:36,991 --> 00:09:38,693
and it's ample enough.

00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:40,828
HODGES:
Do you realize

00:09:40,828 --> 00:09:42,797
how long walnuts have been
around as a food source?

00:09:42,797 --> 00:09:44,965
Archeologists in
Southern France

00:09:44,965 --> 00:09:47,168
found evidence of
roasted walnut shells

00:09:47,168 --> 00:09:49,904
dating back
to the Neolithic period.

00:09:49,904 --> 00:09:51,072
That's 8,000 years ago.

00:09:51,072 --> 00:09:53,140
(shell cracks)
Wow.

00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,141
I did not know that.

00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:55,242
Thank you very much.

00:09:55,242 --> 00:09:58,112
And you're telling us
this because...?

00:09:58,112 --> 00:09:59,146
HODGES:
Well, because

00:09:59,146 --> 00:10:01,248
the trace evidence
collected at the scene,

00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:03,784
the granules on
the suspects' shoes...

00:10:03,784 --> 00:10:06,187
it's ground walnut shell.

00:10:06,187 --> 00:10:07,722
Now, it's not as exotic

00:10:07,722 --> 00:10:08,222
as it sounds.

00:10:08,222 --> 00:10:10,291
It's commonly used
as reptile bedding,

00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,592
if you raise
reptiles.

00:10:11,592 --> 00:10:15,096
They're also used as exfoliants
in soaps and scrubs.

00:10:15,096 --> 00:10:16,630
So it's common stuff.

00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,065
Not gonna help us
very much now, right?

00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:19,166
Not necessarily.

00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,001
Our samples are unique

00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:23,237
in that they are
unusually charred.

00:10:23,237 --> 00:10:24,605
They also
contain

00:10:24,605 --> 00:10:26,707
a trace of calcium hypochlorite.

00:10:26,707 --> 00:10:28,309
I'm still working
to determine why.

00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:29,810
Good, good.

00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,845
Go.

00:10:30,845 --> 00:10:31,979
Work.

00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:34,115
(clears her throat)

00:10:34,115 --> 00:10:35,116
Hey.
(both grunting)

00:10:35,116 --> 00:10:36,584
Oh, lord.

00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:38,586
I need a revolving door
around here.

00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:40,955
Results from the blood
Finlay found at the pawnshop.

00:10:40,955 --> 00:10:42,022
Uh, DNA was male.

00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:44,024
No direct match in CODIS.

00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:47,695
But there was
a familial match to this guy.

00:10:47,695 --> 00:10:49,130
Martin Preach.

00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,066
Three-striker currently residing

00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:53,033
at Ely State Prison.

00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:54,101
I did some checking.

00:10:54,101 --> 00:10:55,970
Mr. Preach has at least one kid.

00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,272
A 19-year-old son named Trey.

00:10:58,272 --> 00:10:59,640
A couple of

00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,308
petty offenses of his own.

00:11:01,308 --> 00:11:02,676
Could be the blood donor.

00:11:02,676 --> 00:11:05,813
Was one of his petty
offenses his hair?

00:11:05,813 --> 00:11:08,015
Wait a second.

00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:09,884
Uh, look at the victim's
comic book drawings.

00:11:09,884 --> 00:11:12,019
The gang that the
superhero is fighting.

00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:13,320
One of them has

00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,322
a purple mohawk.

00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,027
Pow!

00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:27,201
Like father, like son,
I guess. Right, Trey?

00:11:27,201 --> 00:11:29,136
It's not much of a surprise.

00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:30,771
Your dad wasn't exactly around

00:11:30,771 --> 00:11:32,273
during your formative
years, was he?

00:11:33,774 --> 00:11:35,276
I got a family I can count on.

00:11:35,276 --> 00:11:37,211
That's all that matters.

00:11:37,211 --> 00:11:39,213
Yeah, you got your boys, right?
Your-your gang?

00:11:39,213 --> 00:11:42,216
It's one for all, you know?

00:11:42,216 --> 00:11:45,186
Well, I hate to break up
the little party here, Trey,

00:11:45,186 --> 00:11:47,621
but you guys are in it
pretty deep this time.

00:11:47,621 --> 00:11:50,057
You left DNA on the window
at the pawnshop last night.

00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:53,093
As we're sitting here,
our guy is outside matching it

00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:55,062
to the sample
that you gave in the hall.

00:11:55,062 --> 00:11:56,864
STOKES:
You ain't a juvie no more, man,

00:11:56,864 --> 00:11:58,032
and this is far
from your first offense.

00:11:58,032 --> 00:12:01,936
So... I suggest you smarten up.

00:12:01,936 --> 00:12:03,170
SIDLE:
The D.A.'s gonna want
your whole crew.

00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,872
All of them, all right?

00:12:04,872 --> 00:12:07,775
You give us the names
and a serious statement,

00:12:07,775 --> 00:12:10,077
and this murder does not
have to be all on you.

00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:12,213
Hold on. What murder?

00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:13,280
The guy you beat to death

00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,182
in the alley
off Grant last night.

00:12:15,182 --> 00:12:16,350
That murder.

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,619
I don't know nothing about that.

00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:22,623
You don't know
nothing about this?

00:12:22,623 --> 00:12:24,124
Wait a minute.

00:12:24,124 --> 00:12:25,960
This dude?

00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,328
He's the one that's dead?

00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:30,631
I've seen this freak around.

00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:32,333
He wears a mask
or something, right?

00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,268
Uh-huh.
Yeah, I see him sometimes

00:12:34,268 --> 00:12:36,604
when I cruise at night.

00:12:36,604 --> 00:12:38,072
Sad damn freak.

00:12:39,707 --> 00:12:42,009
But I didn't kill him though.

00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:45,679
I didn't touch him.

00:12:50,084 --> 00:12:52,019
Just heard from Nick.

00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,621
Trey Preach
and his purple hair

00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:55,789
deny any involvement
with the murder.

00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:57,691
No shocker, I guess.

00:12:57,691 --> 00:12:58,893
No, shocker would've been
if he didn't deny it.

00:12:58,893 --> 00:13:00,094
Well...

00:13:00,094 --> 00:13:01,195
no problem holding him.

00:13:01,195 --> 00:13:03,264
The guy's a lock
for the smash and grab

00:13:03,264 --> 00:13:04,632
at the pawnshop.

00:13:04,632 --> 00:13:06,634
The problem is

00:13:06,634 --> 00:13:08,669
that may be the only thing
that he's a lock for.

00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:10,704
What do you mean?

00:13:10,704 --> 00:13:13,040
So, the shoe prints
from the pawnshop

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,342
don't match the shoe
prints from the alley.

00:13:15,342 --> 00:13:17,044
You sure about that?

00:13:17,044 --> 00:13:18,679
Unless these guys went
home and changed shoes

00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,180
in between crimes,

00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,216
we're looking at
different gangs.

00:13:22,216 --> 00:13:25,819
Two gangs working
the same neighborhood?

00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:28,622
And what about
the comic book drawings?

00:13:28,622 --> 00:13:29,924
No, no, no.
There-there can't be

00:13:29,924 --> 00:13:32,092
that many guys out there
with purple mohawks.

00:13:33,193 --> 00:13:36,797
Don't we know somebody that-that
saw the gang in the alley?

00:13:36,797 --> 00:13:38,132
The homeless guy, Roger.

00:13:38,132 --> 00:13:40,668
But he said he didn't
remember seeing any faces.

00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:42,169
That's what he said,
but let-let's find him.

00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:44,872
Show him a picture
of Trey and his purple hair.

00:13:44,872 --> 00:13:46,273
Maybe he saw
more than he realized.

00:13:52,328 --> 00:13:54,530
Maybe he decided it was
too high crime an area,

00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,065
and picked up and moved out

00:13:56,065 --> 00:13:57,233
You know what?
I'm gonna go back

00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:59,535
to the other side,
have one more look.

00:13:59,535 --> 00:14:01,670
Then we should check the
alley north of Grant.

00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,572
Okay.

00:14:20,322 --> 00:14:22,625
(thudding)

00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,093
Roger?

00:14:24,827 --> 00:14:27,663
We just want to talk to you.
Hey!

00:14:27,663 --> 00:14:30,099
Hey, who's there?!
(movement nearby)

00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:35,504
Hey! Hey!

00:14:36,172 --> 00:14:38,240
What the hell?

00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,543
Who are you?

00:14:40,543 --> 00:14:41,544
Hey! Okay!

00:14:41,544 --> 00:14:43,479
I'm with the LVPD Crime Lab.

00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:44,513
I need you to step back.

00:14:44,513 --> 00:14:45,781
Just stay back!

00:14:45,781 --> 00:14:46,248
(gun clicks)

00:14:48,651 --> 00:14:51,086
Unless you're faster
than a speeding bullet,

00:14:51,086 --> 00:14:52,488
you better do what she said.

00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:02,487
BRODY: Why were you
in the alley?
We got every right to be there.

00:15:02,487 --> 00:15:03,655
We haven't done anything wrong.

00:15:03,655 --> 00:15:04,756
SANDERS:
All right, for starters,

00:15:04,756 --> 00:15:07,392
how about you take
off your masks?

00:15:07,392 --> 00:15:09,761
Unless you have
something to hide.

00:15:09,761 --> 00:15:12,630
We're not hiding anything.
We're just protecting ourselves.

00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,200
Anonymity is vital to our work.

00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,534
To what we do.

00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:19,370
Which is what exactly?

00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,472
We fight crime.

00:15:20,472 --> 00:15:22,507
We patrol
the streets at night.

00:15:22,507 --> 00:15:24,142
We do whatever we got to do

00:15:24,142 --> 00:15:26,511
to make it tougher on the pimps
and the drug dealers

00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:28,546
and whatever
other criminals we find.

00:15:28,546 --> 00:15:30,648
BRODY:
Okay, we're
on the same side here.

00:15:30,648 --> 00:15:32,750
The guy who was beaten
in this alley last night?

00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,586
Judging from his costume,

00:15:34,586 --> 00:15:36,221
I'm guessing he was
a friend of yours?

00:15:37,121 --> 00:15:39,190
Dominion was beaten?
By who?

00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,525
Where is he?

00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:42,260
He's dead.

00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,063
You didn't know?

00:15:51,336 --> 00:15:52,570
How did it happen?

00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,772
Well, we're working
to figure it out.

00:15:54,772 --> 00:15:56,407
And it would help
if you could tell us

00:15:56,407 --> 00:15:58,076
when was the last
time you saw him?

00:15:58,076 --> 00:16:01,079
Dominion didn't show up
for patrol last night, so

00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:02,447
when he didn't
show up again tonight,

00:16:02,447 --> 00:16:03,781
we decided to go
looking for him and

00:16:03,781 --> 00:16:05,149
that's when we saw
you two entering the alley.

00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:07,285
What was Dominion's real name?

00:16:08,453 --> 00:16:11,089
Your friend is lying
in a morgue.

00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:14,459
An unclaimed John Doe
with a toe tag.

00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:16,794
Tell us his name so we can
at least notify his family.

00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,165
Brad Jeffries.

00:16:25,336 --> 00:16:27,505
All Brad ever wanted to do
was help people.

00:16:27,505 --> 00:16:29,774
I know it sounds trite, but...

00:16:29,774 --> 00:16:33,545
ever since he was ten,
right after his father died,

00:16:33,545 --> 00:16:36,481
he became obsessed with...

00:16:36,481 --> 00:16:38,349
fairness.

00:16:38,349 --> 00:16:41,619
He insisted that
everything had be fair.

00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:44,556
That's when he got lost
in the comic book world

00:16:44,556 --> 00:16:46,524
and this online role-playing.

00:16:46,524 --> 00:16:48,493
How long had he
been doing this?

00:16:48,493 --> 00:16:50,228
Dressing up and going
on, uh, patrol

00:16:50,228 --> 00:16:51,062
with his friends?

00:16:51,062 --> 00:16:53,665
The real-life
superhero movement?

00:16:53,665 --> 00:16:55,633
That's what they call it.

00:16:55,633 --> 00:16:58,202
Uh, they've been doing it
for probably ten months now.

00:16:58,202 --> 00:17:01,105
Did he ever mention any problems

00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:03,641
or run-ins they might've had?

00:17:03,641 --> 00:17:04,642
Any enemies

00:17:04,642 --> 00:17:06,511
they could've made?
He would've knew better

00:17:06,511 --> 00:17:08,780
than to talk to us about it.

00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,416
It would only worry me
that much more.

00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,284
And it only aggravated Seth.

00:17:13,284 --> 00:17:15,520
You weren't a fan
of what he was doing?

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,590
I was afraid of exactly this.

00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,592
I mean, I war... I warned him
I don't know how many times

00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:23,127
that they were playing
a dangerous game.

00:17:23,494 --> 00:17:26,230
It's not comic book
land out there.

00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,201
It's the real world.
People have guns and knives.

00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:32,070
He said it was his calling.

00:17:32,203 --> 00:17:35,239
That it gave meaning
to his life.

00:17:35,239 --> 00:17:36,641
How can you argue with that?

00:17:36,641 --> 00:17:39,410
No, I understand. Um...

00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,114
his two partners--
Tina and Scott?

00:17:43,114 --> 00:17:44,682
How-how well
do you know them?

00:17:44,682 --> 00:17:46,684
Well.

00:17:46,684 --> 00:17:48,620
They're here all the time.

00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,488
They hang out
in the basement.

00:17:50,488 --> 00:17:52,323
They were his best friends.

00:17:52,323 --> 00:17:55,026
They would never
have anything to do

00:17:55,026 --> 00:17:57,729
with his death if that's
what you're thinking.

00:17:58,956 --> 00:18:02,026
So, Brad's mom
doesn't have a problem

00:18:02,026 --> 00:18:04,895
with you guys setting up
in her basement?

00:18:04,895 --> 00:18:06,163
TINA:
I mean, Brad was
the one who brought

00:18:06,163 --> 00:18:07,965
the three of us together.

00:18:07,965 --> 00:18:09,967
You know? Like, inspired us.

00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:11,702
He got me believing I could

00:18:11,702 --> 00:18:13,470
actually make a difference.

00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,805
And change
the world, you know?

00:18:14,805 --> 00:18:16,874
But why like this?

00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:19,543
The masks, costumes?

00:18:19,543 --> 00:18:21,512
Well, we have
our reasons.

00:18:21,512 --> 00:18:22,679
For me?

00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:25,449
I was a victim once.

00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:27,084
Just a 17-year-old girl,

00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:29,686
riding the bus late at night.

00:18:29,686 --> 00:18:30,554
Yeah, I was never a victim.

00:18:30,554 --> 00:18:33,991
But I was into some pretty
dark stuff in the past.

00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:35,125
Hurt people.

00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,061
What I do now,
it's my way to pay it back.

00:18:38,028 --> 00:18:38,695
It's my redemption.

00:18:38,695 --> 00:18:41,532
But you're not police officers.

00:18:41,532 --> 00:18:43,133
You don't have police training.

00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:46,003
You don't have the power
to even arrest anybody.

00:18:46,003 --> 00:18:48,138
What you're doing is
borderline unlawful.

00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:48,772
You know that, right?

00:18:48,772 --> 00:18:49,540
So, what do we do?

00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,674
We-we leave it up to the cops?

00:18:50,674 --> 00:18:51,708
Is that it?

00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:52,776
Well, there's an idea, yeah.

00:18:52,776 --> 00:18:54,044
Cops go where the money is.

00:18:54,044 --> 00:18:56,680
The casinos, the tourists.

00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,715
We aren't exactly
a priority.

00:18:58,715 --> 00:19:00,050
So, that's why we do what we do.

00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,819
Come here and take
a look at this.

00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:05,856
Tell me about the gang
this superhero's fighting.

00:19:05,856 --> 00:19:08,092
SCOTT:
Yeah, we call them
The Disciples.

00:19:08,092 --> 00:19:10,994
They've been running wild around
this area for about a month now.

00:19:10,994 --> 00:19:12,729
They're sort of
our nemesis.

00:19:12,729 --> 00:19:13,964
TINA:
The drawing was Brad's version

00:19:13,964 --> 00:19:16,100
of what would happen
if he found them.

00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,469
These are the rest
of Brad's drawings over here?

00:19:18,469 --> 00:19:20,471
Yeah.

00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:34,017
What's this one about?

00:19:34,017 --> 00:19:35,853
SCOTT:
Just some guy

00:19:35,853 --> 00:19:38,088
we ran into one night. Why?

00:19:38,088 --> 00:19:40,591
Witnesses saw a red
pickup truck last night

00:19:40,591 --> 00:19:42,559
around the time
Brad was murdered.

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,128
What can you tell me about it?

00:19:44,128 --> 00:19:46,463
TINA:
Guy was arguing with a hooker.

00:19:46,463 --> 00:19:47,865
Shoved her down.

00:19:47,865 --> 00:19:50,467
So we intervened.
When he tried to bail,

00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:53,103
Brad smashed the fender
of his truck.

00:19:53,103 --> 00:19:54,938
Know anything about the driver?

00:19:56,006 --> 00:19:57,908
Have you seen him
before or since then?

00:19:57,908 --> 00:20:00,043
No. Just that night.

00:20:00,043 --> 00:20:01,812
Okay. That's it?

00:20:01,812 --> 00:20:03,981
Yeah, that's it.

00:20:05,816 --> 00:20:07,084
Hey.
Hey!

00:20:07,084 --> 00:20:10,120
You know, I had no idea
this was actually a thing--

00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,856
this whole, real-life
superhero movement.

00:20:12,856 --> 00:20:14,124
More than just our trio,
you mean?

00:20:14,124 --> 00:20:15,692
Way more. I have found

00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:17,461
hundreds of people
across the country,

00:20:17,461 --> 00:20:19,096
who like to dress
in superhero costumes

00:20:19,096 --> 00:20:21,465
and go out in their
neighborhoods, mostly

00:20:21,465 --> 00:20:23,000
it seems
with altruistic motives.

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,134
I'm all

00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:26,069
for making a difference,
but the whole

00:20:26,069 --> 00:20:28,539
dress up part just seems so...

00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:29,940
What's the word
I'm looking for?

00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,974
HODGES:
Hello, ladies.

00:20:30,974 --> 00:20:34,511
I bring news
on our walnut shells.

00:20:34,511 --> 00:20:37,181
Now, you remember that I said
they were unique?

00:20:37,181 --> 00:20:38,815
You said they
were charred, right?

00:20:38,815 --> 00:20:40,884
And also that they'd been
exposed to calcium hypochlorite.

00:20:40,884 --> 00:20:41,952
And all that

00:20:41,952 --> 00:20:43,020
just might equal...

00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,955
Sundip Pool Supply.

00:20:44,955 --> 00:20:46,456
Might equal, how?

00:20:46,456 --> 00:20:48,091
Turns out,
ground walnut shell

00:20:48,091 --> 00:20:50,694
is also used by sandblasters
to clean pool tile.

00:20:50,694 --> 00:20:52,763
They spray it
instead of sand

00:20:52,763 --> 00:20:55,132
because the shells don't
scratch the tile.

00:20:55,132 --> 00:20:56,867
And how does that get
us to this Sundip place?

00:20:56,867 --> 00:20:58,869
The charring
and the chemical trace.

00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:01,939
Sundip Pool Supply had a huge
fire about three weeks ago.

00:21:01,939 --> 00:21:04,508
It's the only logical source
I can think of

00:21:04,508 --> 00:21:06,210
that matches
our specific samples.

00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,512
Thanks, Hodges,
I'll check it out.

00:21:16,086 --> 00:21:17,588
Hey, Doc.

00:21:17,588 --> 00:21:19,056
Long day for you.

00:21:19,056 --> 00:21:22,593
Long and busy with some
very interesting findings,

00:21:22,593 --> 00:21:24,728
particularly in the case
of your victim.

00:21:24,728 --> 00:21:26,730
Really? What
have you got?

00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,732
Well, as you can see
in his injuries here,

00:21:28,732 --> 00:21:30,000
there's a lot of bruising
and swelling

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,535
as well as areas
of bleeding.

00:21:31,535 --> 00:21:34,605
All of this is consistent
with a non-lethal beating.

00:21:34,605 --> 00:21:36,106
Non-lethal?

00:21:36,106 --> 00:21:36,974
And yet he's dead.

00:21:36,974 --> 00:21:39,009
Thanks to a single blow

00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:41,979
that landed just here
at the base of the skull.

00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:44,047
The victim was struck once
with significant force,

00:21:44,047 --> 00:21:46,984
<i>effectively transecting</i>
<i>the brain stem</i>

00:21:46,984 --> 00:21:48,719
<i>in the area</i>
<i>of the medulla oblongata.</i>

00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:51,188
Okay, so maybe
during the beating,

00:21:51,188 --> 00:21:53,557
one of the suspects
gets carried away,

00:21:53,557 --> 00:21:55,692
hits the victim in the
base of the skull,

00:21:55,692 --> 00:21:57,427
and kills him.

00:21:57,427 --> 00:21:59,429
But herein lies
the conundrum.

00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:01,965
All this bruising and swelling
you see took time.

00:22:01,965 --> 00:22:04,134
At least 60 minutes
for the body to respond

00:22:04,134 --> 00:22:06,770
to injuries
of this degree.

00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,940
The brain stem injury,
however, was instantly fatal.

00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,675
Instantly?

00:22:11,675 --> 00:22:13,977
Like switching off
a light.

00:22:13,977 --> 00:22:15,946
So the blow
that killed him

00:22:15,946 --> 00:22:18,949
was delivered 60 minutes
after the beating.

00:22:18,949 --> 00:22:22,085
That means that
Brad Jeffries was beaten up

00:22:22,085 --> 00:22:24,554
and left in the alley
for at least an hour.

00:22:24,554 --> 00:22:26,890
According to Doc,
probably unconscious.

00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,725
So somebody had
to come back,

00:22:28,725 --> 00:22:31,595
maybe a gang member
or someone entirely different,

00:22:31,595 --> 00:22:33,096
hit him in the back
of the head,

00:22:33,096 --> 00:22:34,765
and killed him.

00:22:34,765 --> 00:22:36,967
Does Doc have any thoughts
about the murder weapon?

00:22:36,967 --> 00:22:41,071
Said it could be something
like a baseball bat or a club.

00:22:41,071 --> 00:22:44,041
But here you can see
these bands on his neck.

00:22:46,743 --> 00:22:48,512
Wait a second.

00:22:48,512 --> 00:22:52,482
Nick just came back with
some more comic book drawings

00:22:52,482 --> 00:22:54,184
from our superheroes.

00:22:54,184 --> 00:22:57,654
Check out the weapon
in that hero's hands.

00:22:57,654 --> 00:22:59,589
SANDERS:
It's a club with metal bands.

00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:03,827
Right, so maybe our victim
was killed with his own weapon.

00:23:03,827 --> 00:23:05,829
SANDERS: Well, there was
nothing like this recovered

00:23:05,829 --> 00:23:07,998
at the crime scene, so
the killer must have taken it.

00:23:07,998 --> 00:23:10,701
All right, so he either still
has it, or he ditched it.

00:23:10,701 --> 00:23:12,703
There are a lot of Dumpsters
in those alleys.

00:23:12,703 --> 00:23:15,772
Let's get LVPD to check
the area completely, okay?

00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,176
Hey, looks like that
ground walnut shell trace

00:23:19,176 --> 00:23:20,711
might have paid off.

00:23:20,711 --> 00:23:23,113
Thanks to Hodges, I
went and checked out

00:23:23,113 --> 00:23:24,614
this place called
Sundip Pool Supply.

00:23:24,614 --> 00:23:25,982
Their place is all
fenced and boarded up,

00:23:25,982 --> 00:23:28,118
but I got a security
guard to let me in.

00:23:28,118 --> 00:23:30,487
There was charred walnut
shell, just like ours,

00:23:30,487 --> 00:23:31,822
all over the place.

00:23:31,822 --> 00:23:32,956
So our gang must've been there

00:23:32,956 --> 00:23:34,825
at some point
before they went to the alley.

00:23:34,825 --> 00:23:36,693
Guard said that the only
people working there right now

00:23:36,693 --> 00:23:37,861
are the
demolition crew,

00:23:37,861 --> 00:23:40,530
Company name is Agrerro
Demo and Hauling.

00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,998
They are in
there every day,

00:23:41,998 --> 00:23:43,100
and this is
the kicker,

00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,636
the crew's foreman,
Tony Agrerro,

00:23:46,636 --> 00:23:48,105
he drives a red
pickup truck.

00:23:58,115 --> 00:23:59,549
STOKES:
Okay, boys.

00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:01,852
This is the guy
we're looking for right here,

00:24:01,852 --> 00:24:04,054
Tony Agrerro.

00:24:04,054 --> 00:24:05,555
You're sure he's here?
Well, he better be,

00:24:05,555 --> 00:24:07,557
that's his red pickup truck
right there.

00:24:07,557 --> 00:24:09,025
Let's go.

00:24:15,565 --> 00:24:16,900
Yeah.

00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,935
There's the dent right there.

00:24:23,206 --> 00:24:24,775
Hey, Nick.

00:24:24,775 --> 00:24:26,610
Ground walnut shells.

00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,646
Same as on the boots
from the alley.

00:24:29,646 --> 00:24:31,114
(rhythmic beeping)

00:24:31,114 --> 00:24:32,816
Do you hear that?

00:24:42,025 --> 00:24:45,061
(rhythmic beeping continues)

00:24:45,061 --> 00:24:47,063
It's still warm.

00:24:47,063 --> 00:24:48,732
He's got to be
around here.

00:24:52,702 --> 00:24:54,171
Keys are still
in the ignition.

00:24:55,205 --> 00:24:57,140
Oh, Nick.

00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,108
(beeping stops)

00:24:58,108 --> 00:24:59,676
Lot of blood.

00:25:01,077 --> 00:25:02,879
Whoa.

00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:05,782
Mitchell, over here!

00:25:10,454 --> 00:25:11,955
Well, we found him.

00:25:13,523 --> 00:25:14,958
Looks like somebody
had an accident.

00:25:16,526 --> 00:25:18,929
If this was an accident,
I'm Superman.

00:25:30,507 --> 00:25:31,508
Hey, Nick.

00:25:31,508 --> 00:25:32,008
STOKES:
Yeah?

00:25:32,008 --> 00:25:34,177
There are tool marks
on one of these pulleys.

00:25:34,177 --> 00:25:36,179
Looks like somebody
intentionally

00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:38,014
jammed the
winch cable.

00:25:38,014 --> 00:25:39,983
Yeah, they probably knew
the victim would crawl

00:25:39,983 --> 00:25:41,685
into the gap
to fix it.

00:25:41,685 --> 00:25:43,987
Yeah, and then once he was
in there, pulled the lever,

00:25:43,987 --> 00:25:45,689
and squish.

00:25:45,689 --> 00:25:48,692
Victim has a couple
nasty bruises on his face.

00:25:48,692 --> 00:25:49,993
Yeah, yeah,
I saw those.

00:25:49,993 --> 00:25:51,962
Looks like he got
into a fistfight.

00:25:51,962 --> 00:25:53,497
How old do you think
those bruises are, David?

00:25:53,497 --> 00:25:54,631
Recent.

00:25:54,631 --> 00:25:56,166
I don't know-- 24,
48 hours maybe?

00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:59,669
That times out perfectly
for the brawl in the alley,

00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:02,138
so maybe our dead superhero
really did get some licks in

00:26:02,138 --> 00:26:02,839
before they took
him down.

00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:04,641
All right, so we've got
a red pickup truck,

00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:06,776
walnut shells, we
have bruises now,

00:26:06,776 --> 00:26:09,112
so Tony Agrerro here was
definitely a part of the gang

00:26:09,112 --> 00:26:10,213
that beat up Brad Jeffries.

00:26:10,213 --> 00:26:13,049
Yeah, I think so,
and then used his coworkers

00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:13,817
as the rest
of the crew.

00:26:13,817 --> 00:26:15,085
Well, that'll give us
the alley gang,

00:26:15,085 --> 00:26:17,487
but it's not gonna tell us
who actually went back

00:26:17,487 --> 00:26:18,955
to commit the murder.

00:26:18,955 --> 00:26:22,959
Guys, there are some interesting
scratches on this truck.

00:26:24,528 --> 00:26:25,929
(camera shutter clicking
Are they fresh?

00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:27,497
They didn't have
time to rust.

00:26:27,497 --> 00:26:29,766
Weren't the other two
superheroes...

00:26:29,766 --> 00:26:32,769
were they wearing
spiked armbands?

00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:34,704
Who, Scott and Tina?
Yeah.

00:26:34,704 --> 00:26:35,417
Yeah, they were.

00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:38,020
So, uh, maybe
they did this.

00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,321
Case of revenge.

00:26:40,356 --> 00:26:41,457
Time of death, David?

00:26:41,457 --> 00:26:44,393
I'm gonna put T.O.D.
at around midnight last night,

00:26:44,393 --> 00:26:45,361
more or less.

00:26:45,361 --> 00:26:47,162
Midnight.

00:26:47,162 --> 00:26:48,464
You know,
that's not too long

00:26:48,464 --> 00:26:50,165
after I talked
to those two knuckleheads

00:26:50,165 --> 00:26:51,867
about that red
pickup truck.

00:26:57,973 --> 00:26:59,375
You lied, Tina.

00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:00,542
You and Scott.

00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:02,011
Huh? Wh-What are
you talking about?

00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:03,812
Last night when
CSI Stokes was here,

00:27:03,812 --> 00:27:05,948
he told you
about a red pickup

00:27:05,948 --> 00:27:07,983
that had been spotted
near where Brad was killed.

00:27:07,983 --> 00:27:10,886
Yeah. So what?
So when he asked you about
the driver, you said that

00:27:10,886 --> 00:27:12,554
you didn't know anything,
but you did know. You knew

00:27:12,554 --> 00:27:15,157
the driver was Tony Agrerro--
his name's right on the side

00:27:15,157 --> 00:27:18,427
of the truck.
Okay, so maybe we didn't
tell CSI-- what, Stokes?--

00:27:18,427 --> 00:27:20,095
everything,
but, you know,

00:27:20,095 --> 00:27:22,131
obviously, you found
your way to Tony Agrerro.

00:27:22,131 --> 00:27:24,366
Not before you got to him first.

00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:26,368
Wait, got to him first?
What do you mean?

00:27:26,368 --> 00:27:28,103
Tony Agrerro is dead,

00:27:28,103 --> 00:27:30,105
Tina, and we
found evidence

00:27:30,105 --> 00:27:32,308
that at least one of you
was there.
What?

00:27:32,308 --> 00:27:33,943
W-Wait. No.

00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,344
That's not what
we're about.

00:27:35,344 --> 00:27:36,345
Okay? Th-The real-life

00:27:36,345 --> 00:27:38,914
superhero movement is about...

00:27:38,914 --> 00:27:40,983
asserting a positive influence.

00:27:40,983 --> 00:27:42,318
It's about...

00:27:42,318 --> 00:27:44,053
improving the neighborhood.

00:27:44,053 --> 00:27:45,554
You want to improve
your neighborhood?

00:27:45,554 --> 00:27:47,222
Go help in a shelter.

00:27:47,222 --> 00:27:49,358
Get involved
with at-risk kids.

00:27:49,358 --> 00:27:51,827
The game that you are playing
is dangerous, and now

00:27:51,827 --> 00:27:54,463
two people are dead
because of it.

00:27:54,463 --> 00:27:56,799
Where were you last night
around midnight?

00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,268
I was here, with Brad's mom.

00:27:59,268 --> 00:28:01,537
We stayed up all night talking.

00:28:01,537 --> 00:28:03,939
I mean, Brad meant
everything to her.

00:28:03,939 --> 00:28:05,874
All right, she's devastated.

00:28:05,874 --> 00:28:07,876
I couldn't just leave her.

00:28:07,876 --> 00:28:09,812
What about Scott?

00:28:10,379 --> 00:28:11,413
Was he with you?

00:28:13,315 --> 00:28:14,917
No. Uh...
I have...

00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:16,485
I have no idea
where Scott was.

00:28:25,194 --> 00:28:28,364
You need to tell me
where to find Scott, Tina.

00:28:28,364 --> 00:28:29,999
No games this time.

00:28:34,403 --> 00:28:36,238
RUSSELL:
What am I looking at here?

00:28:36,238 --> 00:28:38,273
Tony Agrerro's
trash-hauling crew.

00:28:38,273 --> 00:28:40,442
And shoe impressions confirm
what we already figured:

00:28:40,442 --> 00:28:42,444
they're also his gang
from the alley.

00:28:42,444 --> 00:28:43,479
LVPD rounded them up.

00:28:43,479 --> 00:28:46,382
Morgan and I offered a deal
to the first one to talk.

00:28:46,382 --> 00:28:47,916
We got four takers.

00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:50,319
Their stories line up?
All of them told
the same tale.

00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:52,921
Agreed to beating up
Brad Jeffries in the alley.

00:28:52,921 --> 00:28:55,958
(sighs):
Anybody say why?

00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:58,160
Because their boss
told them to.

00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,230
Right. Agrerro had
that score to settle

00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,332
with the superheroes

00:29:03,332 --> 00:29:05,834
over the hooker
and the damage to his truck.

00:29:05,834 --> 00:29:08,303
Somehow they knew Jeffries
would be walking home from work.

00:29:08,303 --> 00:29:11,240
They also knew that he
couldn't resist playing hero.
So the tussle

00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,208
with the homeless guy
was just a lure

00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:14,843
to get Jeffries
into the alley.

00:29:14,843 --> 00:29:16,278
And Jeffries
took the bait.

00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:19,415
But... they left him alive
after the beating.

00:29:19,415 --> 00:29:21,483
They were all big
on pressing that point.

00:29:21,483 --> 00:29:23,018
Right. Well, we knew that.

00:29:23,018 --> 00:29:25,454
I mean, he was alive for
at least an hour later,

00:29:25,454 --> 00:29:28,490
until one or maybe more of them
came back and killed him.

00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:30,125
Question is,

00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:31,293
who and why?

00:29:31,293 --> 00:29:32,928
Well, here's a thought.

00:29:32,928 --> 00:29:35,164
According to all of them,
Agrerro's mask came off

00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:36,265
during the fight...

00:29:36,265 --> 00:29:38,133
(grunting)
Come on!

00:29:39,435 --> 00:29:41,270
How does it feel
to be a hero?

00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:44,807
<i>...and Jeffries recognized him.</i>

00:29:44,807 --> 00:29:46,275
Well, there's a motive for you.

00:29:46,275 --> 00:29:47,976
After the beating,
everybody leaves,

00:29:47,976 --> 00:29:49,978
Tony starts thinking,

00:29:49,978 --> 00:29:52,147
Tony starts worrying.
Exactly.

00:29:52,147 --> 00:29:54,349
He knows that
if the victim I.D.'s him,

00:29:54,349 --> 00:29:56,485
he could face serious
prison time on the assault.

00:29:56,485 --> 00:29:59,088
RUSSELL:
<i>So an hour later,</i>
<i>everybody's gone.</i>

00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,457
<i>Agrerro goes back to the alley</i>
<i>and kills Jeffries.</i>

00:30:01,457 --> 00:30:02,825
(grunts)

00:30:02,825 --> 00:30:04,460
And then Agrerro
is killed by the...

00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,762
the superhero
out of revenge.

00:30:06,762 --> 00:30:08,464
MORGAN:
Only problem is...

00:30:08,464 --> 00:30:11,100
(sighs)
Tony Agrerro never went
back to the alley.

00:30:12,534 --> 00:30:14,303
You sure about that?

00:30:14,303 --> 00:30:17,272
After beating up Jeffries, they
all went to nurse their wounds

00:30:17,272 --> 00:30:18,373
at a local dive bar.

00:30:18,373 --> 00:30:19,441
I talked
to the bartender.

00:30:19,441 --> 00:30:23,412
Swears all five of them
stayed there until close.

00:30:23,412 --> 00:30:25,514
Agrerro ran a tab
and he never left.

00:30:25,514 --> 00:30:27,816
SANDERS:
Well, if that's true,

00:30:27,816 --> 00:30:30,486
then none of them
could have killed Brad Jeffries.

00:30:31,353 --> 00:30:33,889
STOKES:
Scott...

00:30:33,889 --> 00:30:35,090
I've been
checking on you.

00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,493
You have quite a rap sheet.
Congratulations.

00:30:37,493 --> 00:30:40,429
Almost every
charge in here

00:30:40,429 --> 00:30:43,132
involves you beating the
crap out of somebody.

00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,200
That's before I had a cause.

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,468
You know?

00:30:46,468 --> 00:30:48,070
Something to believe in.

00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,105
This superhero thing?

00:30:50,105 --> 00:30:53,275
Yeah.
You want to know what
I think about that?

00:30:53,275 --> 00:30:56,011
I think the mask and the
cape are just an excuse

00:30:56,011 --> 00:30:57,980
for you to go out
and pound heads.

00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,516
You've always been a thug,
only now you do it in a cape.

00:31:00,516 --> 00:31:02,050
And you tell
yourself it's okay

00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,485
because your victims
are bad guys.

00:31:03,485 --> 00:31:04,853
(softly):
No, man.

00:31:04,853 --> 00:31:06,822
You got me all wrong,
I'm telling you.

00:31:06,822 --> 00:31:09,191
Tony Agrerro
deserved to die,

00:31:09,191 --> 00:31:10,359
am I right?

00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:14,229
He killed your best friend,
so you did what any noble

00:31:14,229 --> 00:31:17,299
superhero would do-- you avenged
your best friend's death.

00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:19,468
Only this time,
Scott...

00:31:19,468 --> 00:31:22,304
that's not being a hero
right there, man,

00:31:22,304 --> 00:31:24,339
that's being a vigilante.

00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:27,176
I... I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,443
I didn't have anything
to do with that.

00:31:28,443 --> 00:31:30,312
You weren't there last night?

00:31:30,312 --> 00:31:33,015
You weren't
at the yard?
No. Nowhere near it.

00:31:33,015 --> 00:31:36,385
Then explain how scratches
ended up on a truck

00:31:36,385 --> 00:31:37,853
that perfectly match

00:31:37,853 --> 00:31:41,390
those bad-ass superhero
bracelets of yours.

00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:43,525
And then maybe

00:31:43,525 --> 00:31:45,093
you can explain to me

00:31:45,093 --> 00:31:48,030
how Tony Agrerro's blood
ended up on your boot.

00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:54,169
All right, I... I was there.

00:31:55,404 --> 00:31:57,105
But he was dead
when I found him.

00:31:57,105 --> 00:32:00,075
I didn't have anything
to do with this, I swear.

00:32:00,075 --> 00:32:02,044
So you were lying before, but
you're telling me the truth now?

00:32:02,044 --> 00:32:05,414
I went looking for him.

00:32:05,414 --> 00:32:07,115
All right? The place was dark.

00:32:07,115 --> 00:32:08,383
I heard a truck engine running.

00:32:08,383 --> 00:32:10,252
I went to go
check it out.

00:32:10,252 --> 00:32:12,120
When I got there,
he was laying there, dead.

00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,389
I reached in to check his pulse.

00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:16,091
That's probably how my arm band
scratched the truck.
Scott,

00:32:16,091 --> 00:32:18,227
if you're gonna lie to me, at
least get your facts straight.

00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,361
Okay? The keys
were in the truck,

00:32:19,361 --> 00:32:21,396
the engine wasn't running.

00:32:24,967 --> 00:32:26,501
You want to try again?

00:32:26,501 --> 00:32:27,869
No.

00:32:27,869 --> 00:32:30,439
What I want is a lawyer.

00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:32,407
Now.

00:32:32,407 --> 00:32:34,109
Hey. How's it
going in there?

00:32:34,109 --> 00:32:36,211
It's not.
He lawyered up.

00:32:36,211 --> 00:32:37,779
Wow, that was fast.

00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:39,548
Nick got him to admit
to being at the scene

00:32:39,548 --> 00:32:40,482
at the time
of the murder.

00:32:40,482 --> 00:32:42,284
It seemed like he was
on the brink of confessing

00:32:42,284 --> 00:32:44,052
and then he just got smart.

00:32:44,052 --> 00:32:45,420
You know, the stupid thing is,

00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,956
if this was about avenging
the death of his friend,

00:32:47,956 --> 00:32:49,157
he killed the wrong guy.

00:32:49,157 --> 00:32:50,359
What do you mean?

00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:52,194
Tony Agrerro and his crew

00:32:52,194 --> 00:32:54,096
alibied out for the murder
in the alley.

00:32:54,096 --> 00:32:55,130
Morgan put them

00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,832
in a neighborhood bar
at the time.

00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,833
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:32:57,833 --> 00:32:59,034
Then who killed
our dead superhero?

00:32:59,034 --> 00:33:00,836
That is still the question.

00:33:00,836 --> 00:33:03,238
Hey. One of our officers
just brought this in.

00:33:03,238 --> 00:33:07,342
Matches the description of the
weapon you're looking for.

00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,078
Where'd he
find it?
The guy was

00:33:10,078 --> 00:33:12,214
threatening some tourist
with it, outside the Palermo.

00:33:12,214 --> 00:33:13,382
I guess they wouldn't

00:33:13,382 --> 00:33:15,951
acknowledge him as
the one, true Batman.

00:33:38,486 --> 00:33:40,155
Hi, Roger.

00:33:40,155 --> 00:33:42,490
(door closes)

00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,492
Do you remember me?

00:33:46,828 --> 00:33:48,196
You gave me my shoes.

00:33:48,196 --> 00:33:49,831
I need you to tell me

00:33:49,831 --> 00:33:51,199
about that club
that you were carrying.

00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:54,502
The club is the source.

00:33:54,502 --> 00:33:55,904
The club gives me power.

00:33:55,904 --> 00:33:59,641
I am invincible with the club!

00:34:01,476 --> 00:34:02,744
Where did you
get the club?

00:34:02,744 --> 00:34:06,114
I... found it.

00:34:06,114 --> 00:34:07,983
You found it where?
In the alley?

00:34:07,983 --> 00:34:10,051
The one that we were
in the other night?
No.

00:34:10,051 --> 00:34:11,152
A different place.

00:34:11,152 --> 00:34:12,554
Uh, in a Dumpster.

00:34:12,554 --> 00:34:13,655
Roger,

00:34:13,655 --> 00:34:16,057
that club belonged to someone.

00:34:16,057 --> 00:34:18,059
The man that
saved you.

00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:19,060
You said he
looked like Batman.

00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,562
You remember?

00:34:20,562 --> 00:34:22,063
I think that you were there,

00:34:22,063 --> 00:34:23,031
in the alley,

00:34:23,031 --> 00:34:24,699
<i>after the fight,</i>

00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:26,935
<i>after the man with the cape</i>
<i>and the mask was hurt.</i>

00:34:26,935 --> 00:34:30,005
<i>That's where you found</i>
<i>the club, isn't it?</i>

00:34:30,005 --> 00:34:31,473
No. I told you.

00:34:31,473 --> 00:34:32,941
The club is mine.

00:34:32,941 --> 00:34:34,042
What happened, Roger?

00:34:34,042 --> 00:34:37,145
<i>Did he wake up?</i>

00:34:37,145 --> 00:34:39,948
<i>Did he startle you, scare you?</i>

00:34:39,948 --> 00:34:43,051
Is that why
you hit him?

00:34:43,051 --> 00:34:46,121
Roger, I need to know
exactly what happened.

00:34:46,121 --> 00:34:47,922
The truth.

00:34:47,922 --> 00:34:50,625
The club's not his.

00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:51,860
The club is mine!

00:34:56,464 --> 00:34:59,000
I found it.

00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,835
In a Dumpster.

00:35:00,835 --> 00:35:02,704
I don't know which one.

00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:03,872
There are so many.

00:35:03,872 --> 00:35:05,473
Give me something then.

00:35:05,473 --> 00:35:07,475
So I can check
your story.

00:35:07,475 --> 00:35:10,045
A golden star.

00:35:10,045 --> 00:35:12,447
What do you mean, a golden star?

00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:15,150
That's it.

00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,952
A golden star.

00:35:20,522 --> 00:35:22,190
Russell.
Yeah.

00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:25,560
I think we just went from
one unsolved murder back to two.

00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,128
I just read
Doc Robbins'

00:35:27,128 --> 00:35:28,997
autopsy report on Tony Agrerro.

00:35:28,997 --> 00:35:31,166
Now, the cause of death,
that's not a surprise--

00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:32,567
that dude was crushed.

00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:34,702
It's the time of death
that's a little off.

00:35:34,702 --> 00:35:36,471
What do you mean, a little off?

00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:38,206
According to Dave,
it was around midnight,

00:35:38,206 --> 00:35:41,109
but according to Doc,
it was much earlier.

00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:43,445
Maybe as much
as 18 hours earlier.

00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:45,013
Whoa.
Which
means our

00:35:45,013 --> 00:35:47,015
other superhero, Scott Hunt,

00:35:47,015 --> 00:35:49,117
he doesn't work as the killer.
He alibis out.

00:35:49,117 --> 00:35:51,052
So he was telling the truth
when he said

00:35:51,052 --> 00:35:54,122
he got to the yard
and Agrerro was already dead.

00:35:54,122 --> 00:35:56,191
How could David
have been so far off

00:35:56,191 --> 00:35:57,859
with his estimate?

00:35:57,859 --> 00:35:59,127
I don't think it
was his fault.

00:35:59,127 --> 00:36:00,462
It was that truck engine.

00:36:00,462 --> 00:36:02,197
It really was running.

00:36:02,197 --> 00:36:05,033
Killer must've left it
that way after the murder.

00:36:05,033 --> 00:36:07,202
But that engine would've
kept that dead body warm though.

00:36:07,202 --> 00:36:09,070
Throwing off
David's calculations

00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,605
when he did the liver stick.

00:36:10,605 --> 00:36:13,441
Okay, so new time
of death.

00:36:13,441 --> 00:36:16,111
That would put Agrerro's murder

00:36:16,111 --> 00:36:19,013
just a little bit
after Brad Jeffries was killed

00:36:19,013 --> 00:36:20,682
in the alley,
right? Probably

00:36:20,682 --> 00:36:22,083
first thing in the morning.

00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:23,885
So what do you think?

00:36:23,885 --> 00:36:26,754
Maybe we have two bodies
but just one killer.

00:36:26,754 --> 00:36:28,523
And zero idea who it is.
I have
good news

00:36:28,523 --> 00:36:30,191
on our murder weapon,

00:36:30,191 --> 00:36:32,927
particularly if you're a
fan of Ethiopian cuisine.

00:36:32,927 --> 00:36:34,129
There was butter on the club,

00:36:34,129 --> 00:36:36,598
infused with a host
of exotic spices:

00:36:36,598 --> 00:36:37,932
fenugreek, cumin,

00:36:37,932 --> 00:36:40,068
coriander, turmeric, cardamom,
cinnamon and nutmeg.

00:36:40,068 --> 00:36:43,071
A concoction more simply known
as tesmi,

00:36:43,071 --> 00:36:45,039
common in Ethiopian cooking.

00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,774
I did a quick check

00:36:46,774 --> 00:36:48,776
and found an Ethiopian
restaurant just five blocks

00:36:48,776 --> 00:36:51,146
from the alley
where the victim was found.

00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:58,019
(siren wailing in distance)

00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:04,425
Well, there's our golden star.

00:37:04,425 --> 00:37:05,793
STOKES:
So maybe old Roger was telling

00:37:05,793 --> 00:37:08,129
the truth about the club.
Yeah.

00:37:09,797 --> 00:37:12,167
It's empty.

00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:14,169
Well, if the killer
dumped the club in there,

00:37:14,169 --> 00:37:16,037
he figured
he'd never see it again,

00:37:16,037 --> 00:37:18,573
'cause it'd be hauled away
with the trash, along

00:37:18,573 --> 00:37:20,808
with any piece of evidence that
might've been along with it.

00:37:20,808 --> 00:37:22,010
Oh, Nick.

00:37:23,444 --> 00:37:25,613
Look at that.

00:37:27,782 --> 00:37:30,118
(Stokes laughs softly)

00:37:30,118 --> 00:37:32,587
Say "cheese."

00:37:32,587 --> 00:37:36,191
RUSSELL:
Clearly, this is you, Seth,

00:37:36,191 --> 00:37:40,128
ditching the murder weapon only
minutes after Brad was killed.

00:37:40,128 --> 00:37:42,130
We also have
your phone records,

00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,831
yours
and Agrerro's.

00:37:43,831 --> 00:37:46,100
Looks like you and he
spoke several times,

00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:50,004
before and right after
Brad was beaten in the alley.

00:37:50,004 --> 00:37:52,006
Seth, you need
to talk to us, man.

00:37:52,006 --> 00:37:54,442
Y-You know
what the jury's gonna think

00:37:54,442 --> 00:37:56,411
when they see this?
They're gonna think

00:37:56,411 --> 00:37:57,979
you're a monster.

00:37:57,979 --> 00:38:00,014
You're not a monster.

00:38:03,484 --> 00:38:07,488
I was just trying
to teach him a lesson.

00:38:07,488 --> 00:38:09,757
23 years old,

00:38:09,757 --> 00:38:13,828
living at home,
dressing up in a costume.

00:38:13,828 --> 00:38:16,764
I-I thought I could scare him,
make him stop.

00:38:16,764 --> 00:38:19,200
By having Tony Agrerro
and his guys

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,201
beat him up?

00:38:20,201 --> 00:38:22,170
Y-You
had warned him that...

00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,172
it was dangerous out there, and
this was gonna make your point.

00:38:24,172 --> 00:38:27,008
It wasn't even that planned.
Oh.

00:38:27,008 --> 00:38:30,812
I-I met Agrerro by chance
at a neighborhood bar.

00:38:30,812 --> 00:38:32,847
I was bitching to the
bartender about Brad

00:38:32,847 --> 00:38:34,816
and his friends,
the-the whole superhero thing.

00:38:34,816 --> 00:38:36,951
And Agrerro overheard me.

00:38:36,951 --> 00:38:39,687
He came over, pissed off.

00:38:39,687 --> 00:38:41,122
Because Brad
dented his truck.

00:38:41,122 --> 00:38:43,825
And-and now he expected me
to pay the repairs.

00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:46,160
Said I owed him 700 bucks.

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,929
I-I joked that
I'd give him

00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:50,798
$1,000 if he and his guys
would...

00:38:50,798 --> 00:38:52,200
rough Brad up.

00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,068
So it was a joke.
I mean,
at first.

00:38:54,068 --> 00:38:57,038
After a few drinks, it started
to sound like a good idea.

00:38:57,038 --> 00:38:58,039
RUSSELL:
Let's talk

00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:00,642
about how we got here, okay?

00:39:00,642 --> 00:39:02,110
H-How did this night happen?
Tony called

00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:05,113
and said that he had done
like we talked about,

00:39:05,113 --> 00:39:06,781
that they-they beat him up.

00:39:06,781 --> 00:39:10,051
And I waited for
Brad to come home,

00:39:10,051 --> 00:39:12,754
e-expecting him
to call it quits.

00:39:12,754 --> 00:39:14,789
But an hour passed,

00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:16,924
he didn't show up.
So I went out looking for him.

00:39:16,924 --> 00:39:19,794
<i>I found him in that alley,</i>
<i>knocked out.</i>

00:39:19,794 --> 00:39:21,129
<i>He was just coming to.</i>

00:39:21,129 --> 00:39:22,096
Brad.

00:39:22,096 --> 00:39:23,831
Seth.

00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:25,566
What are you doing here?

00:39:25,566 --> 00:39:28,169
Your mom's worried.
I came looking for you.

00:39:28,169 --> 00:39:32,607
This is exactly what I warned
you about. Come on, Brad.

00:39:32,607 --> 00:39:33,741
Let's go home.

00:39:33,741 --> 00:39:36,678
But to be honest,
I felt bad for him.

00:39:36,678 --> 00:39:39,914
I mean, not my kid
but-but I still cared.

00:39:41,616 --> 00:39:43,885
But I messed up. I gu...
I guess I said something

00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:47,088
about him being jumped
by a gang.

00:39:47,088 --> 00:39:49,957
How did you know that it was
a gang that beat me up?

00:39:49,957 --> 00:39:51,492
I didn't...
I didn't

00:39:51,492 --> 00:39:53,461
say anything about a gang.
Brad, come on.

00:39:53,461 --> 00:39:55,963
You've been talking
about a gang for weeks now.

00:39:55,963 --> 00:39:57,632
You've never come looking
for me.

00:39:57,632 --> 00:40:00,101
And now you know exactly
where to find me?

00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:02,103
You son of a bitch.

00:40:02,103 --> 00:40:03,805
You did this,
didn't you?

00:40:03,805 --> 00:40:05,139
You set me up.
Okay,

00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:06,441
come on, Brad. Calm down...

00:40:06,441 --> 00:40:08,710
No, don't touch me!

00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:11,446
I will get home on my own.

00:40:11,446 --> 00:40:14,115
And when I do, I'm
telling her what you did,

00:40:14,115 --> 00:40:16,751
and your ass is gonna be out
of our house for good.

00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:18,119
No, no. You can't do that.

00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:19,754
Screw you, Seth.

00:40:20,755 --> 00:40:23,024
She's better off without you.

00:40:24,092 --> 00:40:25,126
No!

00:40:25,126 --> 00:40:26,794
It was just an impulse,

00:40:26,794 --> 00:40:29,764
a stupid mistake.

00:40:29,764 --> 00:40:31,899
The club was in my hand...
Seth,

00:40:31,899 --> 00:40:32,900
we get it.

00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,635
You're not a killer.

00:40:34,635 --> 00:40:35,803
No, I'm really not.

00:40:35,803 --> 00:40:37,872
Yeah, but...

00:40:37,872 --> 00:40:41,409
wh-why don't you
tell me about Tony.

00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:44,178
Tell me how that happened, Seth.

00:40:48,549 --> 00:40:51,119
I went to pay Tony
the next morning.

00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,555
He must've heard
about Brad being dead.

00:40:54,555 --> 00:40:57,024
He thought
that he could blackmail me.

00:40:57,024 --> 00:41:00,495
So when he was
on a call, I...

00:41:00,495 --> 00:41:02,663
jammed the winch cable
on his truck.

00:41:02,663 --> 00:41:07,135
I knew he'd have to crawl
in there to fix it.

00:41:07,135 --> 00:41:10,638
It was just a matter
of throwing a lever.

00:41:10,638 --> 00:41:12,173
RUSSELL:
Okay.

00:41:12,173 --> 00:41:16,878
So... the first killing
was an impulse.

00:41:16,878 --> 00:41:19,113
The second killing
was about money.

00:41:21,682 --> 00:41:25,153
Why don't you tell us again
how you're not a killer, Seth.

00:41:34,061 --> 00:41:36,531
There you are.

00:41:36,531 --> 00:41:38,833
Good work on this
one, by the way.

00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:41,536
Thanks. It was, uh,
good work all around.

00:41:41,536 --> 00:41:45,072
Got a little, uh... a little
something for you here.

00:41:45,072 --> 00:41:48,476
What's this?
Take a look.

00:41:48,476 --> 00:41:51,979
Oh. (chuckles)

00:41:51,979 --> 00:41:54,182
Comic books.
Yep.

00:41:54,182 --> 00:41:56,651
I went through my collection.
I put together a little

00:41:56,651 --> 00:41:59,187
"greatest hits"
bag for you. I also

00:41:59,187 --> 00:42:02,056
plain-wrapped it so I wouldn't
blow your cover around here.

00:42:02,056 --> 00:42:04,192
My cover?
Yeah.
You know,

00:42:04,192 --> 00:42:07,028
as the hard science
and numbers person

00:42:07,028 --> 00:42:08,696
who has no time
for fantasy.

00:42:08,696 --> 00:42:11,098
I actually don't have time
for fantasy.
See,

00:42:11,098 --> 00:42:14,135
that's wrong. Everybody needs
a little fantasy.

00:42:15,169 --> 00:42:18,206
It's a lot of pressure,
you know?

00:42:18,206 --> 00:42:20,541
What if I don't like them?

00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:23,644
Don't tell me.

00:42:25,413 --> 00:42:28,583
Hey, Russell.

00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:31,085
Thank you.

00:42:31,085 --> 00:42:33,087
Yeah. You're welcome.
