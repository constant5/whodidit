00:00:01,702 --> 00:00:04,009
MAN:
I bake them all myself.

00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:05,613
They're pretty damn tasty.

00:00:06,013 --> 00:00:07,550
Pretty potent, too.

00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,522
Of course, edibles are not
for everybody.

00:00:09,522 --> 00:00:11,225
I would say about 80%

00:00:11,225 --> 00:00:13,229
of our patients still prefer
their cannabis

00:00:13,229 --> 00:00:14,599
in traditional form.

00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:17,205
If anxiety is your
main ailment, I'd say

00:00:17,205 --> 00:00:18,507
you go with Purple Diesel.

00:00:18,507 --> 00:00:20,044
It's got the perfect balance
of alertness

00:00:20,044 --> 00:00:21,481
and relaxation.

00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:23,251
Leaves you functional, you know?

00:00:24,053 --> 00:00:25,323
There you go.

00:00:25,323 --> 00:00:27,594
(inhales deeply)

00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:30,768
It smokes a little sweet
and sour, with just...

00:00:30,768 --> 00:00:32,673
a hint of pine on the exhale.

00:00:32,673 --> 00:00:34,175
Yeah, that's nice.

00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:36,180
I'll go with that.
Great.
Your best deal,

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,616
full ounce.

00:00:37,616 --> 00:00:39,321
It's $320.

00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:41,491
Don't suppose
you take a card?

00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:42,628
Cash only.

00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:43,563
(doorbell rings)

00:00:43,563 --> 00:00:45,367
(door buzzes)
Pretty, right?

00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:47,204
Yeah.

00:00:47,204 --> 00:00:49,209
MAN:
Get in there.

00:00:49,209 --> 00:00:50,211
There you go.

00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:51,413
Enjoy.

00:00:51,413 --> 00:00:53,250
Thanks.
Absolutely.

00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:57,259
No need to be shy.

00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:59,231
We're all legal now.
I just need to see

00:00:59,231 --> 00:01:00,801
your medical card,
and I will

00:01:00,801 --> 00:01:03,641
set you up with the right strain
for whatever ails you.

00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:07,383
(phone chiming)

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,790
You should get that.

00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,529
No, it's... it's all right.

00:01:13,529 --> 00:01:14,798
It'll wait.

00:01:14,798 --> 00:01:17,538
(chiming continues)

00:01:17,538 --> 00:01:18,407
No.

00:01:18,407 --> 00:01:20,511
You need to get it now.

00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:25,321
Uh...

00:01:25,321 --> 00:01:26,825
(chuckles)

00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,373
What the hell is this?

00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:38,852
Please, Lloyd, please just do
what they say. Please.

00:01:38,852 --> 00:01:41,791
Please, Lloyd, please
just do what they say. Please.

00:01:43,195 --> 00:01:44,263
Don't, Lloyd.

00:01:44,263 --> 00:01:46,302
Think of your family.

00:01:48,172 --> 00:01:50,176
Why are you doing this?

00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:51,680
What do you want?
Check your texts.

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,183
There should be instructions.

00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,459
What about my family?

00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:13,494
When am I gonna see them?

00:02:13,494 --> 00:02:15,199
I don't know.

00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,836
Soon, I hope.

00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,381
Hey, what's going on?

00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:24,686
Everything
all right there, Lloyd?

00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,758
Hey.

00:02:26,758 --> 00:02:28,194
Hey, hold it right there!

00:02:28,194 --> 00:02:29,630
Stop!

00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,499
No! Wait, no!

00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:49,441
Please, Lloyd. Please just do
what they say. Please.

00:02:50,243 --> 00:02:51,646
Please, Lloyd.
Please just do what they say...

00:02:51,646 --> 00:02:53,550
SIDLE: The wonders
of technology, right?

00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,924
The threats and the demands both
sent to the guy's cell phone.

00:02:56,924 --> 00:02:58,928
So the kidnapping's legit?

00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,265
We checked on that?

00:03:00,265 --> 00:03:01,801
Yeah, cops confirmed.

00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:03,405
Guy's wife never showed up
to work.

00:03:03,405 --> 00:03:05,442
Kids never made it to school.

00:03:05,442 --> 00:03:08,416
Whoever sent the video and
the text used the wife's phone.

00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,453
We really got nothing
to trace here.

00:03:10,453 --> 00:03:12,859
Yeah. So right now...

00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,596
she's our only lead.

00:03:14,596 --> 00:03:15,866
What do we know
about her, David?

00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:17,903
At the moment, next to nothing.

00:03:17,903 --> 00:03:20,944
She has no I.D., no car keys,
no cell phone.

00:03:20,944 --> 00:03:22,881
There's not a single thing
to identify the body.

00:03:22,881 --> 00:03:24,953
Did you run
her prints?
Yeah.

00:03:24,953 --> 00:03:26,289
She doesn't have any.

00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,758
What do you mean?

00:03:27,758 --> 00:03:29,295
She has no fingerprints.

00:03:29,295 --> 00:03:31,300
Her tips are completely smooth.

00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,471
Let me see.
Yeah.

00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:35,576
SIDLE:
Nick,

00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:36,778
this woman is our
only connection

00:03:36,778 --> 00:03:38,515
to finding that mother
and her kids,

00:03:38,515 --> 00:03:39,552
to getting them back.

00:03:41,356 --> 00:03:43,326
STOKES: Well, that
security guard only fired

00:03:43,326 --> 00:03:44,496
one shot.

00:03:44,496 --> 00:03:47,569
Let's hope he didn't kill
four people.

00:03:54,718 --> 00:03:57,557

00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,918
Please, Lloyd, please just
do what they say. Please.

00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:28,058
Please, Lloyd, please just do
what they say. Please.

00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:29,963
Why would she do this?

00:04:29,963 --> 00:04:32,902
Why would she take
my family from me?

00:04:32,902 --> 00:04:33,971
My children?

00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:34,974
You told
Detective Crawford

00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,410
that you'd never
seen her before,

00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,580
that she'd never
been in here.

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,748
What about your house?

00:04:38,748 --> 00:04:41,321
She and... whoever she
might be working with

00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:44,528
were probably watching you,
studying your habits.

00:04:44,528 --> 00:04:46,967
Did you see any strange cars
on the street this morning?

00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:48,804
No. Everything was normal.

00:04:48,804 --> 00:04:51,477
Dina drops the kids off
at school on her way to work.

00:04:51,477 --> 00:04:54,083
I... helped
buckle them in the car.

00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,418
Kissed them good-bye.

00:04:55,418 --> 00:04:56,855
What if that's the last time
I ever see them?

00:04:56,855 --> 00:04:59,094
What if they're gone?

00:04:59,094 --> 00:05:01,633
Mr. Bryant, I know
this is very difficult,

00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:04,539
but it doesn't do any good
to think like that right now.

00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:06,710
Right now...

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,416
let's just focus on getting
your family back, okay?

00:05:09,651 --> 00:05:10,853
Yeah.

00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,701
What do you think?

00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:19,538
I don't know, man,
she's still a mystery,

00:05:19,538 --> 00:05:21,810
all the way down to her
perfectly smooth fingertips.

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,013
I've never seen
anything like it.

00:05:23,013 --> 00:05:24,449
You got something there
with the shoes?

00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,824
There is a foreign sticky
substance on the soles.

00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:30,430
I didn't see the source for
it anywhere in the shop,

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,634
so she could've picked
it up on the way in.

00:05:32,634 --> 00:05:35,374
Could tell us how she got
here, where she came from.

00:05:35,374 --> 00:05:36,610
You know what's bugging me?

00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,980
Hmm?
The money.

00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,683
Almost $300,000?

00:05:39,683 --> 00:05:42,456
I mean, why did he have
that much cash on him?

00:05:42,456 --> 00:05:43,792
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:45,028
Hey, Crawford?
CRAWFORD:
Yeah?

00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:47,400
What's the deal with
all this cash?

00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,637
These people
never heard of banks?

00:05:48,637 --> 00:05:50,607
Yeah, banks, credit
card companies--

00:05:50,607 --> 00:05:52,712
they didn't want anything to do
with the marijuana business.

00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:55,485
They're afraid the funds
could be seized as drug money.

00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:56,788
But this is a
legal dispensary.

00:05:56,788 --> 00:05:58,558
Legal, according to the state.

00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,095
The Feds--
they have different ideas.

00:06:00,095 --> 00:06:01,197
So, these places
are "cash only"?

00:06:01,197 --> 00:06:02,533
Yeah.

00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:04,170
Well, it's no wonder
this place was targeted.

00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,875
I mean, between the money
and all this product,

00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,444
there's got to be
a million dollars here.

00:06:07,444 --> 00:06:11,086
That explains the vault,
the cameras,

00:06:11,086 --> 00:06:12,489
and that armed guard.

00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:13,758
A lot of good that did.

00:06:13,758 --> 00:06:16,597
Still couldn't protect
what really matters.

00:06:27,856 --> 00:06:29,593
FINLAY: <i>Jared Briscoe,</i>
<i>the Gig Harbor Killer,</i>

00:06:29,593 --> 00:06:31,565
<i>murdered seven women.</i>

00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:34,537
RUSSELL: <i>You think the brothers</i>
<i>were working together?</i>

00:06:34,537 --> 00:06:36,542
FINLAY: <i>I think they still are.</i>
RUSSELL: <i>You want me to resign?</i>

00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:37,811
ECKLIE:
<i>No, I don't want you to resign.</i>

00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:39,682
<i>If Briscoe and his brother</i>
<i>really are the ones</i>

00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:41,453
<i>behind these murders,</i>
<i>catch them.</i>

00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,548
Greg told me I'd find you here,
lost in Gig Harbor.

00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:58,223
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

00:06:58,223 --> 00:07:00,562
I have no idea
what I'm thinking.

00:07:00,562 --> 00:07:02,099
I don't even know
where to begin.

00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:04,236
It's like Seattle
all over again,

00:07:04,236 --> 00:07:06,542
just waiting for
another body to drop.

00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:08,980
I have an idea where
we should start.

00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:13,089
Winthrop claimed that he didn't
know he had a twin brother

00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:14,560
until he saw him on the news.

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,829
We both know
that's not true.

00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:17,232
Yeah, but knowing something
and proving it

00:07:17,232 --> 00:07:18,568
are two different things.

00:07:18,568 --> 00:07:21,908
Yeah, so we need to prove
that their paths did cross

00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,212
before the
killing started.

00:07:23,212 --> 00:07:24,748
How we gonna do that?

00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:26,118
We go back to
the beginning,

00:07:26,118 --> 00:07:27,989
and then we follow
the road from there.

00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,258
Start with the adoption.

00:07:29,258 --> 00:07:30,728
Yes.

00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:33,033
So, I couldn't find any
adoption history for Winthrop,

00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:36,040
but Briscoe was--
as his brother said--

00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,113
"consigned to the hell"
of foster care.

00:07:39,113 --> 00:07:41,285
And we do have
records for those.

00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:42,955
Yes, we do.

00:07:42,955 --> 00:07:46,296
I'm not so sure that Ecklie's
gonna give us the resources

00:07:46,296 --> 00:07:48,166
for this kind of
fishing expedition.

00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,637
Maybe he doesn't
have to.

00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:51,574
I have some vacation
days coming up,

00:07:51,574 --> 00:07:54,113
and I would love to
take a trip to Seattle

00:07:54,113 --> 00:07:57,621
and dig through some adoption
records and court files.

00:07:59,024 --> 00:08:00,627
You know I like to fish.

00:08:05,305 --> 00:08:08,177
Patrol unit spotted it
in response to the BOLO.

00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:11,184
Belongs to Dina Bryant,
dispensary owner's wife.

00:08:11,184 --> 00:08:12,955
Well, this street's
on the route

00:08:12,955 --> 00:08:14,893
from their house to
the kids' preschool.

00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:17,064
Kidnappers must've
followed them from home.

00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:19,769
Cops said they spoke to a woman
who heard tires squealing.

00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:22,309
She looked out,
saw a van racing away.

00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:24,080
A dark blue van?

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,785
Yeah. How did you know that?

00:08:26,785 --> 00:08:29,057
Looks like a fresh dent
on the bumper here.

00:08:29,057 --> 00:08:30,928
Some blue paint
left behind.

00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,198
(camera clicks)

00:08:32,198 --> 00:08:34,636
Must have been
how they were taken.

00:08:34,636 --> 00:08:36,841
Kidnapper bumped
the back of the car.

00:08:36,841 --> 00:08:38,678
Okay, stay right here.
I'll be right back, okay?

00:08:38,678 --> 00:08:40,650
(tires screech)
BRODY: <i>And then grabbed them</i>

00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,055
<i>when the mother pulls over to</i>
<i>exchange insurance information.</i>

00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:44,892
No, please! My babies!

00:08:52,977 --> 00:08:54,781
STOKES:
Hey.

00:08:54,781 --> 00:08:56,651
I can't figure
her out, Nick.

00:08:56,651 --> 00:08:57,854
What do you mean?

00:08:57,854 --> 00:08:59,958
There's just nothing
about her that fits.

00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:00,994
This crime was
well-planned.

00:09:00,994 --> 00:09:03,166
Despite the fact that
it went sideways, it was smart.

00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:06,239
But watching her-- she has
no idea what she's doing.

00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:09,345
She's nervous,
she's tense, hesitant.

00:09:09,345 --> 00:09:11,684
She's way out of her element.
Well, I'm still trying

00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,121
to figure out
how she even got there.

00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:15,359
She didn't have any car keys,
the cops checked the parking lot

00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:16,729
around the crime scene,

00:09:16,729 --> 00:09:18,099
didn't find a car
that could've been hers,

00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,936
so she must have had a ride.

00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:21,406
What's that?
Oh, yeah.

00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:24,747
This is the latest footage
from a check-cashing place

00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:26,818
up the street
from the dispensary.

00:09:26,818 --> 00:09:28,254
It's kind of hard to see,

00:09:28,254 --> 00:09:30,994
but the dispensary
should be right up there.

00:09:30,994 --> 00:09:32,330
Yeah, but look.

00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,668
That car, double parked.

00:09:34,668 --> 00:09:35,737
Looks like a Mustang, black.

00:09:35,737 --> 00:09:38,143
Then it suddenly
takes off.

00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:40,148
Check that time code.

00:09:40,148 --> 00:09:43,154
That's just seconds after the
security guard fired his gun.

00:09:43,154 --> 00:09:45,425
That's got to be it.
That's the partner right there.

00:09:45,425 --> 00:09:47,196
There's no way in hell
to read the plates.

00:09:47,196 --> 00:09:48,131
No.

00:09:48,131 --> 00:09:49,902
It's molasses.

00:09:49,902 --> 00:09:51,272
What is?

00:09:51,272 --> 00:09:52,775
HODGES: The sticky substance
on the bottom

00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:54,145
of her shoes-- it's molasses.

00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:56,183
Blackstrap molasses
to be specific.

00:09:56,183 --> 00:09:58,888
Come on.
Who uses molasses these days?

00:09:58,888 --> 00:10:01,060
Interesting answer:
marijuana growers.

00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,897
For what?
Molasses, it turns out,

00:10:02,897 --> 00:10:05,369
is a common soil additive
to cultivating cannabis.

00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:07,975
This lady was a grower?

00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:10,982
I don't buy that any more than
I buy her as a kidnapper.

00:10:10,982 --> 00:10:12,485
CRAWFORD:
<i>The woman--</i>

00:10:12,485 --> 00:10:14,991
who could she have been
working with?

00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:18,465
Did you have any problems with
anyone opening up your shop?

00:10:18,465 --> 00:10:20,469
Do you owe money?

00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:22,941
Do you deal with anyone
who could be trouble?

00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:24,211
Are you kidding me?

00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:26,950
I'm in the
drug business.

00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,291
I may be legal, but it's
a gray area at best.

00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,529
My growers are
technically outlaws.

00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:35,002
My main competition
are street dealers

00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:37,207
and-and delivery services
who think

00:10:37,207 --> 00:10:38,944
I'm stealing
their business.

00:10:38,944 --> 00:10:40,179
It's the Wild West
all over again.

00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:41,182
Yeah, I understand that.

00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,088
But was there
anyone in particular?

00:10:44,088 --> 00:10:46,827
I don't know.

00:10:46,827 --> 00:10:48,097
It could be anyone

00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:52,240
who has any idea
how much cash involved.

00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,992
What now?

00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:02,462
What am I supposed to do?

00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,032
We wait for
the kidnappers to try

00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:05,402
to make contact with you again.

00:11:05,402 --> 00:11:07,540
Now, we already have people--
police-- at your house.

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,110
They're setting up your phones.

00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,115
We're gonna do
the same thing here.

00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:12,351
That's it?

00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:22,006
David said
you were done.

00:11:22,006 --> 00:11:23,342
You find anything?

00:11:23,342 --> 00:11:24,544
Not what you're looking for.

00:11:24,544 --> 00:11:27,384
There are no surgical
or cosmetic implants,

00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:29,889
nothing with a serial number
we could trace.

00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,161
Her identity is
still a mystery.
Afraid so.

00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:34,833
I can explain the absence
of fingerprints,

00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:35,903
if it's any consolation.

00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,907
She was on a drug
called capecitabine.

00:11:37,907 --> 00:11:40,914
One of its side effects is
the shedding of fingerprints.

00:11:40,914 --> 00:11:42,551
And what is the
drug used for?

00:11:42,551 --> 00:11:44,455
It's given to
recovering cancer patients.

00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:45,892
She'd undergone surgery

00:11:45,892 --> 00:11:47,529
for colon cancer.

00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:49,366
Successful surgery, it appears.

00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:52,306
I thought it was interesting,
given how she got here.

00:11:52,306 --> 00:11:53,475
Her tox report.

00:11:55,312 --> 00:11:58,319
She tested
positive for THC.

00:11:58,319 --> 00:11:59,521
She was a
marijuana user.

00:11:59,521 --> 00:12:02,462
Medicinal, probably,
because of the cancer.

00:12:02,462 --> 00:12:05,167
There was no evidence
of heavier substances

00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:08,408
or intravenous drug use.

00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:11,180
You know, maybe
we're not beaten yet.

00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,954
Her axillary lymph nodes
are discolored.

00:12:13,954 --> 00:12:17,495
I assumed it was due
to melanoma, given her history.

00:12:17,495 --> 00:12:19,198
But it could be
something else.

00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:20,334
Something else, like what?

00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:21,370
Well, let's find out.

00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:28,051
Well, the node is
easily enough removed.

00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:29,354
(grunts softly)

00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,579
BRODY:
That looks like ink.

00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:42,449
It is. Tattoo ink.

00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:45,990
<i>During the tattoo process,</i>
<i>it's deposited in the dermis.</i>

00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,530
<i>Microphages digest it,</i>

00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,670
<i>and then migrate</i>
<i>into the closest lymph nodes.</i>

00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,608
But she doesn't
have any tattoos.

00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:56,380
She doesn't now,
but she did at some point.

00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,218
Why don't you
hit the lights.

00:12:58,218 --> 00:13:00,690
Even if it's been removed,
we can still find it.

00:13:06,336 --> 00:13:08,407
Why don't you
turn her head there.

00:13:08,407 --> 00:13:10,345
There you go.

00:13:10,345 --> 00:13:13,452
It was laser removed, but
there's no hiding from the ALS.

00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:18,496
You know what? I've seen
this tattoo before.

00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,168
RUSSELL:
Morgan said we had a lead

00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:22,705
on the dispensary case?

00:13:22,705 --> 00:13:24,676
Maybe. Turns out,
our mystery woman

00:13:24,676 --> 00:13:26,413
had a tattoo
on her neck.

00:13:26,413 --> 00:13:30,022
Ties her to a local gang set,
the Bridge Rock Devils.

00:13:30,255 --> 00:13:31,492
And those are all devils?

00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:33,162
I pulled
arrest records on

00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:35,968
every female member arrested
in the last ten years.

00:13:35,968 --> 00:13:38,039
Wait a minute.

00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:40,077
What about that?
Could be.

00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,582
That's her.

00:13:42,582 --> 00:13:43,986
Seven years ago.

00:13:43,986 --> 00:13:45,723
Allison Ball.

00:13:45,723 --> 00:13:47,193
Current address?

00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,066
SANDERS:
<i>1217 Crescent, Boulder City.</i>

00:13:56,313 --> 00:13:57,047
Clear!

00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,386
Bedroom's clear!

00:13:59,386 --> 00:14:01,758
Sorry, Stokes.

00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,362
No sign of any hostages.

00:14:03,362 --> 00:14:04,665
Place is all yours.

00:14:04,665 --> 00:14:07,037
Okay, thank you, Captain.

00:14:18,428 --> 00:14:20,466
"Teacher of the Year"?

00:14:20,466 --> 00:14:22,437
Yeah, something's not right.

00:14:22,437 --> 00:14:24,107
Does this look like
the home of a lady

00:14:24,107 --> 00:14:26,713
who would kidnap
somebody to you?

00:14:26,713 --> 00:14:28,116
No.

00:14:29,185 --> 00:14:31,190
Hey, Nick, her phone.

00:14:33,294 --> 00:14:34,731
She got a video, too.

00:14:36,101 --> 00:14:38,506
I'm sorry, Ally.

00:14:38,506 --> 00:14:42,782
Please, just do what they say,
or they're gonna kill me.

00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,319
I'm sorry, Ally.

00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:45,521
Who is he?

00:14:45,521 --> 00:14:47,626
I don't know,
but there's pictures of him up

00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:49,730
all over the place.
Brother, maybe?

00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,169
Yeah, either that
or a boyfriend.

00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:54,708
She didn't go to that dispensary
to rob the place.

00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,479
She was trying to save him.

00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,484
She's not the one
we're after here.

00:14:58,484 --> 00:15:01,657
And it looks like we have
one more hostage to find.

00:15:05,232 --> 00:15:06,635
I'm sorry, Ally.

00:15:06,835 --> 00:15:09,441
Please, just do what they say,

00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,345
or they're gonna kill me.

00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:13,283
I'm sorry, Ally. Please...

00:15:13,283 --> 00:15:15,254
STOKES: The young man
tied up in that video

00:15:15,254 --> 00:15:17,559
is Allison Ball's
little brother.

00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:19,396
Stuart-- 24 years old,

00:15:19,396 --> 00:15:20,565
no criminal record.

00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:22,637
Greg's at his apartment
right now,

00:15:22,637 --> 00:15:24,240
checking him out.

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,311
Can we trace the phone
that sent this?

00:15:26,311 --> 00:15:28,182
No, no. Same as before.

00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:30,186
The bad guys used
the victim's phone.

00:15:30,186 --> 00:15:32,325
Same with the text with
the instructions on it.

00:15:32,325 --> 00:15:33,862
Gave the address
of the dispensary.

00:15:33,862 --> 00:15:35,331
Told her to

00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:40,275
go there to be with the owner
at 10:15 a.m. exactly.

00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:43,316
"If either of you fail
to follow instructions,

00:15:43,316 --> 00:15:44,719
your brother dies."

00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:47,825
Our dead teacher's just
a pawn in all of this.

00:15:47,825 --> 00:15:49,462
Bad guys who are

00:15:49,462 --> 00:15:53,338
using her to insulate
themselves from the crime.

00:15:53,338 --> 00:15:54,139
Well, yeah, that way

00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:56,311
they don't have to step
one foot in that dispensary.

00:15:56,311 --> 00:15:57,580
You know?
They're never on camera.

00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,883
It's ingenious.

00:15:58,883 --> 00:16:01,289
Why these two?
Why were the teacher

00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:03,828
and her brother chosen
for this robbery?

00:16:03,828 --> 00:16:05,298
Must have just crossed paths

00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:09,172
with the kidnapper
at some point.

00:16:09,172 --> 00:16:10,542
Well, she's a teacher.

00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:12,881
Maybe we're looking at a
parent of one of her students.

00:16:12,881 --> 00:16:14,618
She just went through
a whole year of

00:16:14,618 --> 00:16:17,725
cancer treatments; it could be
somebody associated with that.

00:16:17,725 --> 00:16:21,366
Or...

00:16:21,366 --> 00:16:24,172
could be the demon weed.

00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:25,943
You know, Lloyd said
that he'd never

00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:29,251
seen Allison before, that
she wasn't a customer.

00:16:29,251 --> 00:16:31,522
You think he could've been
lying? You think he knew her?

00:16:31,522 --> 00:16:33,527
If we can prove
a connection here,

00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:36,934
then maybe we're having another
conversation with Lloyd.

00:16:36,934 --> 00:16:40,275
The common denominator
in all of this?

00:16:40,275 --> 00:16:41,410
Marijuana.

00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,649
♪&amp; ♪&amp;

00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:13,983
(sniffs)

00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,555
There was this guy, lived
in my dorm in college.

00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:17,957
Everybody used to
call him Space Bob.

00:17:17,957 --> 00:17:19,427
Your lab smells
like his room.

00:17:19,427 --> 00:17:21,966
That's not a compliment
to either of you.

00:17:21,966 --> 00:17:23,670
Yeah, it is
pretty pungent in here.

00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:27,245
Uh, especially the Skunkadelic.

00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:29,550
Mmm, mm-hmm.

00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,853
This is all from
Lloyd's dispensary?

00:17:30,853 --> 00:17:32,523
All these strains?

00:17:32,523 --> 00:17:34,595
I don't mean to sound
square, but is there really

00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,833
that big a difference,
one from the other?

00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,438
Absolutely.
Each strain has its own

00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:42,579
unique level of, uh, countless
cannabinoids and terpenoids,

00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:44,717
which gives pot
its medicinal value.

00:17:44,717 --> 00:17:47,056
Believe it or not,
there is a legit medical basis

00:17:47,056 --> 00:17:48,759
for marijuana use.

00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:50,930
Uh, granted, the names don't
really help the credibility.

00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,802
Yeah, well, that's true.
Yeah.

00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:54,405
What else did you find out?

00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:56,610
Well, I'm using
Near IR Spectrometry

00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,648
to analyze
Lloyd's inventory.

00:17:58,648 --> 00:18:00,785
Because of the varying
cannabinoid levels

00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:02,456
of each strain,

00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,496
it produces its own unique
wave form or spectrum.

00:18:05,496 --> 00:18:06,900
Uh, fingerprint of sorts.

00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,570
Ah.

00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,911
Well, which wave form is
from our dead teacher's pot?

00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:13,748
It's this one here.

00:18:13,748 --> 00:18:16,520
Unfortunately, it's not a match
to any of Lloyd's stuff.

00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,057
Allison Ball wasn't
buying her marijuana

00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:19,794
from Lloyd's dispensary?

00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:22,801
Well, that makes me wonder
where she was getting it from.

00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,571
Well, there might be
a way to find out.

00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:25,841
There's a database
being assembled

00:18:25,841 --> 00:18:27,845
in Connecticut,
with help from the Feds.

00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:30,751
They're cataloging marijuana
by its actual DNA.

00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:32,388
CODIS for cannabis?

00:18:32,388 --> 00:18:34,995
You know, if Henry can
isolate a DNA profile

00:18:34,995 --> 00:18:37,701
for Allison Ball's marijuana,
then we might get lucky

00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,871
and run it against
the Feds' database.

00:18:45,351 --> 00:18:48,023
Hey. What's all this?

00:18:48,023 --> 00:18:50,528
Allison Ball's life.

00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:53,369
Her finances,
her health, her job.

00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:56,108
All the little lives
that she touched.

00:18:56,108 --> 00:18:58,680
Well, I, uh, just checked out
her brother's apartment.

00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,389
I'm thinking that he might
be a little sketchy.

00:19:02,389 --> 00:19:03,824
Oh, what do you mean?
What'd you find?

00:19:03,824 --> 00:19:05,562
Well, it's more
what I didn't find.

00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:06,831
No evidence of employment.

00:19:06,831 --> 00:19:09,037
No check stubs, no bank
or tax statement.

00:19:09,037 --> 00:19:11,542
Yet he lives in
this nice place.

00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:14,381
Has a big TV, gaming
system and all that.

00:19:14,381 --> 00:19:16,920
I don't know, maybe
big sister was, uh,

00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,524
helping him out
financially.

00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,429
I-I don't know how.

00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:21,731
I... I mean,

00:19:21,731 --> 00:19:23,601
from what I've seen,
it looks like

00:19:23,601 --> 00:19:26,742
her cancer pretty much
obliterated her finances.

00:19:26,742 --> 00:19:28,747
She basically
had nothing left.

00:19:30,717 --> 00:19:32,088
Except...

00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,092
Wow. This is weird.

00:19:34,092 --> 00:19:35,795
Uh...
What?

00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:38,869
How do you think that happened?

00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:43,947
Hey, Russell,
you got a sec?

00:19:43,947 --> 00:19:45,182
I do. What do you got?

00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:47,087
Uh, bank statement
for Allison Ball

00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:49,493
shows a $50,000-deposit made

00:19:49,493 --> 00:19:51,763
to her account
just six weeks ago.

00:19:51,763 --> 00:19:53,568
$50,000? From whom?
No record.

00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:55,037
It was all cash.

00:19:55,037 --> 00:19:57,644
So how does a teacher
who makes, what, 65K tops

00:19:57,644 --> 00:20:00,783
come across $50,000 cash?

00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,955
Maybe she wasn't just
an innocent victim.

00:20:02,955 --> 00:20:04,091
All right...

00:20:04,091 --> 00:20:05,896
Uh, gentlemen?

00:20:05,896 --> 00:20:08,033
I've got something
you might find interesting.

00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:09,904
"Us-2-U Wellness."

00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:12,176
It's an online
marijuana delivery service.

00:20:12,176 --> 00:20:14,514
There are dozens
that operate locally.

00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:17,655
You can scroll through
their various strains-- indicas,

00:20:17,655 --> 00:20:19,525
sativas, hybrids.

00:20:19,525 --> 00:20:21,529
Point, click and the order's
at your door in two hours.

00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:24,603
And-and what does
this have to do with our case?

00:20:24,603 --> 00:20:27,075
The Feds recently raided Us-2-U.

00:20:27,075 --> 00:20:29,047
And the pot
that they seized was entered

00:20:29,047 --> 00:20:31,819
into their burgeoning
marijuana DNA database,

00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:33,489
where they found a match

00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:35,962
to the pot that you found
in Allison's apartment.

00:20:35,962 --> 00:20:38,534
So that's where she
got her marijuana.

00:20:38,534 --> 00:20:40,739
And the guy behind Us-2-U...

00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,543
Calvin Reynolds.

00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:44,915
Calvin Reynolds drives
a black Mustang.

00:20:44,915 --> 00:20:47,220
Nick and Sara said
that they saw

00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,658
a black Mustang in front
of the dispensary.

00:20:49,658 --> 00:20:51,596
It took off
after Allison was shot.

00:20:51,596 --> 00:20:54,202
CRAWFORD: You seem to be running
afoul of the law lately, Calvin.

00:20:54,202 --> 00:20:56,172
What's up with that?

00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,776
You mean the Fed bust?

00:20:57,776 --> 00:20:59,113
That's crap.

00:20:59,113 --> 00:21:01,183
My attorneys already filed
to have the case dropped.

00:21:01,183 --> 00:21:03,522
The Web site was back up
and running in three days.

00:21:03,522 --> 00:21:06,061
Medical marijuana use
is legal in Nevada.

00:21:06,061 --> 00:21:07,899
Pretty soon,
recreational use will be, too.

00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:09,536
You got a problem with that,
that's too bad.

00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:11,907
To be honest, I really don't
care one way or another.

00:21:11,907 --> 00:21:13,845
This isn't about
marijuana for me.

00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:16,718
You, uh...

00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:18,856
You know this woman?

00:21:18,856 --> 00:21:20,225
That's Allison Ball.

00:21:20,225 --> 00:21:22,097
Strange thing--

00:21:22,097 --> 00:21:24,168
she had molasses
on the soles of her shoes

00:21:24,168 --> 00:21:25,905
when she was shot dead
this morning.

00:21:27,608 --> 00:21:31,150
Well, molasses is used in the
cultivation of cannabis, right?

00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,721
Yeah, sure.
Lot of the growers use it.

00:21:32,721 --> 00:21:33,756
Do you?

00:21:33,756 --> 00:21:35,293
Hey, the only
reason I'm asking

00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:36,996
is because
we had a look

00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:39,836
inside of that black
Mustang of yours

00:21:39,836 --> 00:21:42,776
and we found molasses
spilled all on the carpet.

00:21:42,776 --> 00:21:45,148
Now, in my mind, that
puts Allison in your car

00:21:45,148 --> 00:21:47,152
and you, Calvin,

00:21:47,152 --> 00:21:49,657
in front of the dispensary
when she was shot.

00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:54,067
Hey, buddy...

00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:55,570
I get the motive.

00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:57,876
You know, you used to be
the only game in town.

00:21:57,876 --> 00:22:00,047
Now you have these
dispensaries opening up.

00:22:00,047 --> 00:22:02,285
I mean, they're
stealing your business.

00:22:02,285 --> 00:22:04,022
They're stealing your money.

00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:05,192
Tell me,

00:22:05,192 --> 00:22:06,327
why her?

00:22:06,327 --> 00:22:09,668
Why would you rope
a poor, innocent girl

00:22:09,668 --> 00:22:11,038
into your scheme?

00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,042
Nobody ever roped Ally
into anything.

00:22:14,612 --> 00:22:16,651
The fact is, she called me.

00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:20,025
Oh, so she was the
criminal mastermind

00:22:20,025 --> 00:22:21,294
behind all of this.
(chuckles)

00:22:21,294 --> 00:22:22,297
Is that it?

00:22:22,297 --> 00:22:25,069
Ally and me go way back.

00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:26,773
We both grew up in Bridge Rock.

00:22:26,773 --> 00:22:28,210
We were both Devils.

00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,212
She got out.

00:22:29,212 --> 00:22:32,352
Made a better life.

00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,323
But she always called me
when she needed me.

00:22:34,323 --> 00:22:36,093
Like when the cancer came
and the doctor

00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:38,933
suggested pot might help,
she called me.

00:22:38,933 --> 00:22:40,704
When her medical bills
started piling up

00:22:40,704 --> 00:22:42,976
and the treatment became
too expensive, she called me.

00:22:42,976 --> 00:22:44,679
So you gave her money?

00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:47,852
$50,000. And I'd do it again
in a second, gladly, just...

00:22:49,857 --> 00:22:51,961
...just because of
who she was.

00:22:51,961 --> 00:22:53,966
So you helped her out
from time to time.

00:22:53,966 --> 00:22:57,975
How does that
get us to today?

00:22:57,975 --> 00:22:59,979
She called me this morning.

00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:02,251
She was panicked, said...

00:23:02,251 --> 00:23:04,322
said somebody had
grabbed up her brother.

00:23:04,322 --> 00:23:05,725
And they had, uh,

00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:07,329
you know, given...
given her instructions

00:23:07,329 --> 00:23:08,966
on how to get him back.

00:23:08,966 --> 00:23:12,106
But she was, uh...
she was scared.

00:23:12,106 --> 00:23:14,412
She was... she was
too freaked out to do it alone.

00:23:14,412 --> 00:23:18,019
So she called...
and she asked you to drive.

00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:20,692
And I would've done the
whole thing for her if I could.

00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:27,106
When I realized she...

00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:30,413
she wasn't coming back out, I...

00:23:30,413 --> 00:23:32,284
(sighs)

00:23:32,284 --> 00:23:34,456
...I just left.

00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:40,837
She should've just
let that bastard rot.

00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:44,311
You're talking about
her brother-- Stuart?

00:23:44,311 --> 00:23:46,048
Ally said he'd been running
numbers for some bookie.

00:23:46,048 --> 00:23:48,720
She thought that's who
would be behind the kidnapping.

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,226
Okay, Calvin, do you know
who he was working for?

00:23:51,226 --> 00:23:54,032
I need a name.
I need the name of the bookie.

00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:55,268
No.

00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:57,940
No, Ally didn't know the name.

00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,783
What's going on?
Have you heard anything?

00:24:01,783 --> 00:24:03,453
No. Not yet, Lloyd. I'm sorry.

00:24:03,453 --> 00:24:06,059
This doesn't make any sense!
They should have called by now!

00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:07,194
They should have
made contact!

00:24:07,194 --> 00:24:08,731
Why haven't they called?!
Lloyd!

00:24:08,731 --> 00:24:09,967
Listen to me.

00:24:09,967 --> 00:24:11,871
Whoever the kidnappers are,
they are scrambling

00:24:11,871 --> 00:24:14,043
right now, trying to
come up with a new plan.

00:24:14,043 --> 00:24:15,412
We just have to wait.

00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,083
For how long?

00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,486
I don't know.

00:24:18,486 --> 00:24:20,457
But I know
they're worth waiting for.

00:24:20,457 --> 00:24:23,832
In the meantime...

00:24:23,832 --> 00:24:25,101
maybe you can help me.

00:24:25,101 --> 00:24:26,370
Have you seen this guy?

00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,843
His name is Stuart Ball;
He's the brother of the woman

00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:30,378
that was shot in here
this morning.

00:24:30,378 --> 00:24:31,482
Do you know him?

00:24:31,482 --> 00:24:33,285
Has he been in here, maybe?

00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:35,491
No. I don't
recognize him.

00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:37,194
Is he involved somehow?

00:24:37,194 --> 00:24:38,831
He's in business
with some bad people.

00:24:38,831 --> 00:24:40,100
That's all we know right now.

00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,072
(phone ringing)

00:24:42,072 --> 00:24:43,842
Hold on, Lloyd,
hold on. Not yet.

00:24:43,842 --> 00:24:46,181
(phone continues ringing)

00:24:47,851 --> 00:24:49,154
All right, I'm ready.

00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:50,924
Go ahead,

00:24:50,924 --> 00:24:51,859
answer it.

00:24:53,496 --> 00:24:55,468
Hello?

00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,279
No. We're closed right now.

00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,815
I don't know
for how long.

00:25:01,815 --> 00:25:04,020
I have to keep this line free.

00:25:04,521 --> 00:25:05,857
(cell phone ringing)

00:25:05,857 --> 00:25:08,229
This is Keys.

00:25:08,229 --> 00:25:10,066
You got him. Where?

00:25:10,066 --> 00:25:13,273
Yeah. You were just asking
about Stuart Ball?

00:25:13,273 --> 00:25:14,410
Well, it sounds like

00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,980
our guys just found him.

00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,986
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

00:25:18,986 --> 00:25:21,258
SANDERS:
Blue van.

00:25:21,258 --> 00:25:22,895
BRODY:
Just like the woman saw

00:25:22,895 --> 00:25:24,164
speeding away
from the kidnapping.

00:25:30,044 --> 00:25:32,048
(flies buzzing)

00:25:35,055 --> 00:25:37,159
It's just Stuart.

00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:39,365
No sign of the mother
or the kids.

00:25:39,365 --> 00:25:41,570
Well, now we know
whoever has them

00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,374
isn't afraid to kill.

00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:54,398
Just talked to the van's owner;
pretty much sure I ruined

00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:55,968
his Hawaiian vacation.

00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,106
He's in Hawaii?
So the van's stolen?

00:25:58,106 --> 00:25:59,342
Mm-hmm.

00:25:59,342 --> 00:26:01,046
Well, the shot
was at close range.

00:26:01,046 --> 00:26:03,351
The shooter was in the van
with the victim--

00:26:03,351 --> 00:26:06,358
most likely
in the passenger seat.

00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:08,195
Although...

00:26:08,195 --> 00:26:10,232
that's a good amount
of high-velocity

00:26:10,232 --> 00:26:11,903
impact spatter up here.

00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,342
Maybe a little luminol
will tell a better story.

00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:28,239
There's blood splatter
all over the passenger seat.

00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:31,947
Not all of it. Look there,
on the side of the seat.

00:26:31,947 --> 00:26:33,017
There's a blood void.

00:26:33,017 --> 00:26:35,054
From what?

00:26:35,054 --> 00:26:37,126
The shooter wasn't up front.

00:26:37,126 --> 00:26:38,662
He was in back.

00:26:38,662 --> 00:26:41,635
BRODY: <i>He reached</i>
<i>between the seats to fire.</i>

00:26:41,635 --> 00:26:45,109
<i>His arm kept the blood from</i>
<i>hitting</i> <i>that part of the seat.</i>

00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:47,248
It settled on his arm instead.

00:26:47,248 --> 00:26:48,450
But what about
the round?

00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,922
The shot was
through-and-through.

00:26:50,922 --> 00:26:52,259
Didn't break any windows.

00:26:53,394 --> 00:26:55,466
It caught the A-pillar.

00:27:02,014 --> 00:27:03,451
STOKES:
<i>According to Doc Robbins,</i>

00:27:03,451 --> 00:27:05,989
Stuart Ball died between
six and ten hours ago.

00:27:05,989 --> 00:27:09,564
Six to ten-- that's shortly
after the robbery went bad.

00:27:09,564 --> 00:27:10,032
Yeah.

00:27:10,032 --> 00:27:11,301
That can't help our chances

00:27:11,301 --> 00:27:13,171
of finding the mother
and her kids alive.

00:27:13,171 --> 00:27:14,174
Stuart Ball had

00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,710
served his purpose, right?

00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,017
Mother and the two kids
could still be worth some money.

00:27:19,017 --> 00:27:20,956
That might be reason
to keep them alive.

00:27:20,956 --> 00:27:22,693
Well, I hope
you're right.

00:27:22,693 --> 00:27:25,632
Hey, guys, I think we just
caught a break with ballistics.

00:27:25,632 --> 00:27:28,506
I got an IBIS hit off the bullet
that killed Stuart Ball.

00:27:28,506 --> 00:27:31,044
It matches a round
that was fired five years ago

00:27:31,044 --> 00:27:32,280
in a fatal carjacking attempt.

00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,152
Did they catch the carjacker?

00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,320
In a matter of speaking.

00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,724
I guess the carjacker
was the fatality.

00:27:36,724 --> 00:27:39,596
The owner of the car
shot him in self-defense.

00:27:39,596 --> 00:27:42,068
So the gun belonged to the car
owner-- tell me you got a name.

00:27:42,068 --> 00:27:44,274
Remi Volero--
he's kind of a low-rent

00:27:44,274 --> 00:27:46,211
real estate mogul.

00:27:46,211 --> 00:27:48,516
Mostly strip clubs
and mini-malls.

00:27:48,516 --> 00:27:50,320
But take a look at the rap
sheet-- everything on it

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,525
is related to bookmaking
and racketeering.

00:27:52,525 --> 00:27:53,995
Guy's a bookie.

00:27:53,995 --> 00:27:56,066
Well, Stuart Ball was
running numbers for a bookie.

00:27:56,066 --> 00:27:57,203
What are the odds?

00:27:57,203 --> 00:27:58,738
It's got to be
the same guy.

00:27:58,738 --> 00:28:02,079
That your handiwork, Remi?

00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,719
That is not my handiwork.

00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:06,790
I don't know
what the hell that is.

00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,460
You don't know him?
Stuart Ball?

00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,465
'Cause I'm pretty sure
he worked for you.

00:28:10,465 --> 00:28:13,071
I said I didn't know
whatthat is.

00:28:13,071 --> 00:28:15,443
I didn't say I didn't know who.

00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,247
Yeah, Stuart worked for me

00:28:17,247 --> 00:28:18,515
running errands.

00:28:18,515 --> 00:28:20,487
He worked for you running
numbers and making collections

00:28:20,487 --> 00:28:22,224
as part of your
illegal gambling operation.

00:28:23,526 --> 00:28:26,166
You're not even gonna ask
what happened to him?

00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:27,770
I can see what happened to him.

00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,172
Someone capped him.

00:28:29,172 --> 00:28:30,442
Yeah, somebody-- with your gun.

00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,446
Did you forget, Remi?
Your gun's in the system.

00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:34,652
You used it five years ago
to shoot a carjacker.

00:28:34,652 --> 00:28:38,126
The thing is,
it's not my gun anymore.

00:28:38,126 --> 00:28:39,763
I gave it to Stuart
a couple years back.

00:28:39,763 --> 00:28:41,133
Where are they, Remi!

00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:42,670
Where's Dina Bryant
and her children?!

00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,273
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:28:44,273 --> 00:28:45,275
Yeah, you do.

00:28:45,275 --> 00:28:46,511
You are underwater

00:28:46,511 --> 00:28:48,416
on a dozen
real estate investments.

00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:50,286
That dispensary
was an easy mark.

00:28:50,286 --> 00:28:52,223
All that cash
just sitting there.

00:28:53,794 --> 00:28:58,270
This isn't a conversation
I'm interested in having.

00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,475
I want my lawyer.

00:29:01,845 --> 00:29:02,680
RUSSELL:
<i>It's awfully convenient</i>

00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,684
he gave his gun to Stuart,
don't you think?

00:29:04,684 --> 00:29:06,555
Crawford's willing to
hold him for 48 hours,

00:29:06,555 --> 00:29:09,428
but I don't know if that's gonna
help Dina Bryant and her kids.

00:29:09,428 --> 00:29:12,301
You said that this Remi guy
had a lot of real estate, right?

00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:13,437
At least 25 properties.

00:29:13,437 --> 00:29:15,108
He could be using any of them
or none of them.

00:29:15,108 --> 00:29:17,178
We have the kidnap van.

00:29:17,178 --> 00:29:19,717
The odds are pretty good
that wherever the victims are,

00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:21,187
that van was there.

00:29:21,187 --> 00:29:23,760
We keep working the van,
figure out where it's been.

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,661
RUSSELL:
Right.

00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,468
♪&amp; ♪&amp;

00:29:43,336 --> 00:29:46,410
♪&amp; ♪&amp;

00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,472
What do you mean he's gone?
Well, yeah, but how does

00:30:14,472 --> 00:30:16,643
something like that happen?
I'm on my way right now.

00:30:16,643 --> 00:30:18,213
BRODY:
Nick.

00:30:18,213 --> 00:30:19,450
What's going on?

00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,420
Well, Lloyd has
ducked out on the cops

00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,924
that were babysitting him;
now nobody can find him.

00:30:22,924 --> 00:30:24,961
The only reason he
would have taken off is

00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:27,500
if the kidnappers
contacted him.

00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,272
He must have gone
to pay the ransom.

00:30:29,272 --> 00:30:31,609
Crawford's got a bead on
his cell phone; we'll find him.

00:30:51,888 --> 00:30:54,226
What's up?
LLOYD:
No, no, no.

00:30:54,226 --> 00:30:55,797
What are you doing here?
You can't be here!

00:30:55,797 --> 00:30:57,232
They said no cops!
Who did?

00:30:57,232 --> 00:30:58,436
No, no!
You have to go!

00:30:58,436 --> 00:31:01,308
If you're here,
they won't bring my family.

00:31:01,308 --> 00:31:02,745
Who's "they"?
Did somebody contact you?

00:31:03,747 --> 00:31:06,252
Lloyd, where's the money?

00:31:06,252 --> 00:31:08,825
I dropped it off to them,
like they said.

00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,596
I gave them
what they wanted.

00:31:10,596 --> 00:31:12,567
Where? And how?

00:31:12,567 --> 00:31:14,571
Over at the tennis courts,
across the park.

00:31:14,571 --> 00:31:15,807
Gonna be long gone by now.

00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:17,745
Well, please tell me
you saw something.

00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,820
I just want my family back.

00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,724
But you didn't get them back!

00:31:23,724 --> 00:31:25,996
You gave the kidnappers
their money.

00:31:25,996 --> 00:31:27,833
And now they're
not worth anything anymore.

00:31:29,037 --> 00:31:30,707
STOKES:
Well...

00:31:30,707 --> 00:31:32,878
let's just hope you didn't
get your whole family killed.

00:31:39,627 --> 00:31:40,996
All right, I-I'll pass
the word along.

00:31:40,996 --> 00:31:42,700
See you when you're back.
That was Nick.

00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,871
He said the ransom money
is long gone and Lloyd,

00:31:44,871 --> 00:31:47,310
the shop owner, had no contact
with whoever took it.

00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,880
Okay, so where's that leave us?

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,718
Remi Volero's lawyered up.

00:31:50,718 --> 00:31:52,354
Right?
So even if he knows

00:31:52,354 --> 00:31:53,758
where Dina Bryant
and those kids are,

00:31:53,758 --> 00:31:55,462
he's not gonna say anything.

00:31:55,462 --> 00:31:56,797
Any ideas?

00:31:56,797 --> 00:31:58,468
Well, I may have something.

00:31:58,468 --> 00:32:00,038
It's gonna be vague though.

00:32:00,038 --> 00:32:01,742
The, uh, kidnappers
have been

00:32:01,742 --> 00:32:03,646
really smart at communicating.

00:32:03,646 --> 00:32:05,383
They use the victims' phones

00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:07,387
to send the initial
videos and texts.

00:32:07,387 --> 00:32:08,657
And when they're
not sending,

00:32:08,657 --> 00:32:10,495
they keep the phones turned off.

00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,398
Making it impossible
to locate, right.

00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:14,804
They contacted Lloyd tonight
with the ransom demands.

00:32:14,804 --> 00:32:16,107
How did they do that?

00:32:16,107 --> 00:32:18,646
Well, they sent an e-mail
using Stuart Ball's phone.

00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:20,383
It was on
for less than 20 seconds.

00:32:20,383 --> 00:32:22,053
I've been going through
the cell carrier's

00:32:22,053 --> 00:32:26,496
cached data to try and pinpoint
which cell tower they pinged.

00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:30,940
There you go.

00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,809
Like I said,

00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:33,946
it's vague.
No, no,
that's a good start.

00:32:33,946 --> 00:32:36,051
Let's look real
hard at this

00:32:36,051 --> 00:32:38,623
Remi Volero,
see what we can link him to

00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,093
inside of that circle.

00:32:40,093 --> 00:32:43,099
BRODY:
Now, I know Nick is the expert,

00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:45,873
but this just looks like
a common crane fly to me.

00:32:45,873 --> 00:32:47,108
They're everywhere in Vegas.

00:32:47,108 --> 00:32:49,113
I don't know how
they're gonna help us

00:32:49,113 --> 00:32:52,119
pinpoint where
the van has been.

00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:53,523
You having better luck
on your side?

00:32:53,523 --> 00:32:55,695
You mean, am I having
any better luck

00:32:55,695 --> 00:32:56,964
with the bird
excrement?

00:32:56,964 --> 00:32:58,834
It's not lost
on me that,

00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:00,672
of all the trace
that you pulled,

00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,476
you gave me the poop.

00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:07,587
Interesting poop though.

00:33:07,587 --> 00:33:10,728
Contains a poison
called Meríasol.

00:33:10,728 --> 00:33:12,498
Similar to hemlock.

00:33:12,498 --> 00:33:16,006
So the birds ate the poison,
but they didn't die?

00:33:16,006 --> 00:33:18,678
Meríasol is poisonous
to humans, not to birds.

00:33:18,678 --> 00:33:20,616
It comes from the
berries they eat.

00:33:20,616 --> 00:33:24,157
Where do the berries grow?

00:33:24,157 --> 00:33:28,133
Apparently, only
in the rainforests.

00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:31,540
Not in the middle of
the Nevada desert.

00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,144
Unless...

00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:35,482
there <i>is</i> a rainforest
in the middle

00:33:35,482 --> 00:33:36,751
of the Nevada desert.

00:33:36,751 --> 00:33:38,155
The Mediterranean Casino

00:33:38,155 --> 00:33:40,025
has a rainforest garden.

00:33:40,025 --> 00:33:41,696
100% humidity.

00:33:41,696 --> 00:33:43,701
I went there once,
my hair went insane.

00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:45,972
We just need to know

00:33:45,972 --> 00:33:48,444
if they have a Meríasol tree.

00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:49,981
Put the Mediterranean
on the map.

00:33:49,981 --> 00:33:52,186
Why? It's not
in the circle.

00:33:52,186 --> 00:33:54,658
There were bird droppings
on top of the van.

00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:56,863
They contained a
specific type of berry.

00:33:56,863 --> 00:33:58,967
Far as I can tell,

00:33:58,967 --> 00:34:00,771
it only grows at
the Mediterranean.

00:34:00,771 --> 00:34:02,609
You think the birds
were feeding there?

00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:03,945
Yeah, probably starlings.

00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:05,648
According to the
groundskeeper,

00:34:05,648 --> 00:34:07,587
those birds have been
all over the berries.

00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,526
Now, uh, put a circle
around the casino,

00:34:10,526 --> 00:34:11,996
quarter-mile radius.

00:34:11,996 --> 00:34:14,067
Apparently, starlings nest

00:34:14,067 --> 00:34:16,940
within a quarter mile
of their food source.

00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,513
That narrows the area way down.

00:34:19,513 --> 00:34:20,849
Greg,

00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:24,223
zoom in a little more,
just the wedge.

00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:28,566
Volero owns
something there, too,

00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,903
doesn't he?

00:34:29,903 --> 00:34:31,706
Right here, off Bennett.

00:34:31,706 --> 00:34:34,079
He bought it six months ago.

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,916
It's an old produce warehouse.

00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,586
Morgan's starlings.

00:34:52,586 --> 00:34:54,022
Yeah.

00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:57,663
Nick.

00:35:16,004 --> 00:35:18,710
CRAWFORD: It looks like
a kidnapper's kit to me.

00:35:21,015 --> 00:35:23,253
STOKES:
Yup.

00:35:23,253 --> 00:35:25,292
These are their phones.
This is definitely the place.

00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:27,129
Hey, Nick, shh, shh.
(quiet creaking)

00:35:27,129 --> 00:35:29,568
Listen.

00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,743
(creaking continues)

00:35:37,986 --> 00:35:39,288
Oh, my God!

00:35:39,288 --> 00:35:41,594
Mrs. Bryant, calm down.
Are you okay?

00:35:41,594 --> 00:35:42,897
Where are you children?
I don't know.

00:35:42,897 --> 00:35:44,801
They're in some
room somewhere.

00:35:46,037 --> 00:35:47,273
What...
Come with us.

00:35:47,273 --> 00:35:48,977
Stay close.
Okay.

00:35:48,977 --> 00:35:51,215
(TV playing quietly)

00:35:55,091 --> 00:35:57,663
Stay back.

00:36:02,674 --> 00:36:05,013
Oh, my God, my babies!

00:36:05,013 --> 00:36:06,716
My babies! My babies.

00:36:06,716 --> 00:36:08,754
Mommy!
My babies.

00:36:08,754 --> 00:36:09,957
Everything's okay now.

00:36:09,957 --> 00:36:12,328
Okay? I'm here.
I'm here now.

00:36:12,328 --> 00:36:14,667
Mommy.
(mouthing)

00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:16,805
Let me see you.
Oh, my God.

00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:23,320
Hi, guys.

00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,625
Dina.
Hi.

00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:27,027
How are they doing?

00:36:27,027 --> 00:36:29,166
Uh, they seem okay,
thank God.

00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:31,003
Uh, I'm gonna show
you a photo lineup.

00:36:31,003 --> 00:36:33,241
I want you to tell me
if any of these men

00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:34,912
were involved in
the kidnapping.

00:36:34,912 --> 00:36:36,181
I-I... I can't.

00:36:36,181 --> 00:36:37,851
I mean, I never saw a face.

00:36:37,851 --> 00:36:39,388
They always had masks on.

00:36:39,388 --> 00:36:42,128
That's okay, take
a look anyway.

00:36:42,128 --> 00:36:44,132
Maybe you've seen one of them
in your neighborhood

00:36:44,132 --> 00:36:46,169
or around the kids'
school or...
(sighs)

00:36:46,169 --> 00:36:49,110
Okay.

00:36:50,178 --> 00:36:51,815
I... No, I don't...

00:36:51,815 --> 00:36:53,686
recognize any of these,
I'm sorry.

00:36:57,027 --> 00:36:58,831
They're here? They're okay?

00:36:58,831 --> 00:37:01,002
Yeah, yeah, they
checked out just fine.

00:37:01,002 --> 00:37:03,341
But I can't let you
in there just yet.

00:37:03,341 --> 00:37:05,880
Why?
Well, they still have
to be processed.

00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,417
What do you mean?
I have to see them.

00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:09,087
I'm sorry, Lloyd,
but Sara has to

00:37:09,087 --> 00:37:11,826
collect their clothes,
give them a quick once-over.

00:37:11,826 --> 00:37:13,029
You know, even the
smallest detail

00:37:13,029 --> 00:37:16,170
can help us catch the
guys who did this to you.

00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,174
So just... sit tight.

00:37:18,174 --> 00:37:19,744
Yeah.

00:37:22,884 --> 00:37:24,187
(whispers): Hi.

00:37:30,868 --> 00:37:32,138
What's up?

00:37:32,138 --> 00:37:35,145
Haven't you already analyzed
every single frame of those?

00:37:35,145 --> 00:37:37,015
Now I have more to work with.

00:37:37,015 --> 00:37:39,254
All we had before
were the five-second loops.

00:37:39,254 --> 00:37:41,191
Now we have the phones

00:37:41,191 --> 00:37:42,327
that they were filmed on.

00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:44,465
It's only
another second or two,

00:37:44,465 --> 00:37:46,737
but there are
heads and tails on each.

00:37:46,737 --> 00:37:49,409
At the end of this one,
the camera tilts up

00:37:49,409 --> 00:37:51,514
and catches just

00:37:51,514 --> 00:37:52,884
a piece of window.

00:37:52,884 --> 00:37:54,320
And there's a
reflection in it.

00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,057
Maybe I can enhance it.

00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:03,240
Looks like you're
getting something.

00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:07,215
I can see...

00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,959
Oh, my God, Greg.

00:38:14,431 --> 00:38:18,005
Last 24 hours must have been
pretty trying for you.

00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:21,514
Not at all what you expected
when yesterday began, huh?

00:38:21,514 --> 00:38:24,520
God, no. No, not in a million
years could I have thought

00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,825
something like this
could happen to us.

00:38:26,825 --> 00:38:29,966
No, no, you thought it'd be
quick and easy, didn't you?

00:38:29,966 --> 00:38:32,838
Probably over
in less than an hour.

00:38:32,838 --> 00:38:35,110
You and Stuart
would have the money.

00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,513
Couldn't have guessed

00:38:36,513 --> 00:38:38,517
that Stuart's sister
was gonna be shot.

00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:41,424
Right? I mean, you just thought
she'd pick up the money,

00:38:41,424 --> 00:38:44,565
drop it off where you and Stuart
told her to in the instructions.

00:38:44,565 --> 00:38:46,535
(scoffs)

00:38:46,535 --> 00:38:48,373
That's-that's, uh...

00:38:48,373 --> 00:38:50,010
This is crazy. I...

00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:50,878
(sighs)

00:38:50,878 --> 00:38:53,250
Mr. Russell, you can't
honestly think that

00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,389
I was involved somehow?

00:38:55,389 --> 00:38:57,192
I was a victim.

00:38:57,192 --> 00:38:59,965
My children were victims.

00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:03,272
Certainly looked that way
in the video, I have to admit.

00:39:03,272 --> 00:39:05,277
I mean, that was...
that was terrifying.

00:39:05,277 --> 00:39:07,415
What was your plan if we hadn't
found you in the warehouse?

00:39:07,415 --> 00:39:09,420
What-What were you gonna do?

00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,357
Were you gonna
miraculously escape

00:39:11,357 --> 00:39:13,962
and then flag down a car,
dial 911?

00:39:13,962 --> 00:39:15,900
You know, I-I don't need
to listen to this...

00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,936
Hey, you sit down.

00:39:22,414 --> 00:39:25,588
Look, I have been through hell.

00:39:25,588 --> 00:39:27,325
Okay? And I just...
I want to go home,

00:39:27,325 --> 00:39:30,365
and I want to be with my family.

00:39:30,365 --> 00:39:34,575
Mrs. Bryant, we know that
you and Stuart filmed the video.

00:39:34,575 --> 00:39:36,145
Just the two of you.

00:39:36,145 --> 00:39:38,584
No kidnappers.
No Remi Volero.

00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,187
You filmed each other.

00:39:40,187 --> 00:39:43,060
I mean, that is you,
isn't it?

00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,867
Uh...

00:39:45,867 --> 00:39:48,205
Look, you... you
have to know that

00:39:48,205 --> 00:39:50,176
I didn't want to
do any of this.

00:39:50,176 --> 00:39:51,345
It was Stuart.
No.

00:39:51,345 --> 00:39:52,915
No, no, he-he forced me.

00:39:52,915 --> 00:39:54,218
Stuart was just
some young kid

00:39:54,218 --> 00:39:56,557
that you tricked
into helping you.

00:39:56,557 --> 00:39:58,594
No, he...
Stuart had a gun.

00:39:58,594 --> 00:40:00,098
And he threatened
to hurt us.

00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:02,068
Well, he didn't have the gun
when you shot him

00:40:02,068 --> 00:40:03,172
in the head though, did he?

00:40:06,879 --> 00:40:08,550
<i>See, what you don't realize is</i>

00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:11,890
<i>that we found Stuart's blood</i>
<i>on the sleeve of your sweater.</i>

00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:15,231
Mrs. Bryant, we have
all the evidence we need.

00:40:15,231 --> 00:40:17,536
You're done.

00:40:20,643 --> 00:40:22,949
Mr. Russell,

00:40:22,949 --> 00:40:25,454
you look the other
way on this...

00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:30,465
...and half of
what I have...

00:40:30,465 --> 00:40:31,968
is yours.

00:40:31,968 --> 00:40:33,171
Mrs. Bryant,

00:40:33,171 --> 00:40:37,513
you have absolutely nothing
I want.

00:40:41,256 --> 00:40:44,028
Man, she's a piece of work.
Mm.

00:40:44,028 --> 00:40:46,100
She's not gonna say
where the money is.
Well, she thinks

00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,970
it's gonna be waiting for
her when she gets out.

00:40:49,674 --> 00:40:51,344
Only, she's never getting out.

00:41:08,315 --> 00:41:12,324
RUSSELL: <i>I'm starting to wonder</i>
<i>if something's changed.</i>

00:41:12,324 --> 00:41:15,264
<i>Some ripple of inhumanity</i>
<i>has built into this</i>

00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:20,308
wave of cruelty
and indifference.

00:41:20,308 --> 00:41:23,315
Feel like we're being swallowed
by this darkness.

00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:25,319
FINLAY:
Mm. That bad, huh?

00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:28,025
(chuckles)

00:41:28,025 --> 00:41:31,032
I'm a little moody today,
I'll give you that.

00:41:31,032 --> 00:41:33,204
I could use some
good news, Jules.

00:41:33,204 --> 00:41:35,074
I wish I had something for you.

00:41:35,074 --> 00:41:37,480
But the, uh...
records clerk up here

00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,452
hasn't exactly
been cooperative.

00:41:40,452 --> 00:41:42,457
But I will get you
Briscoe's foster care files.

00:41:42,457 --> 00:41:43,760
Don't you worry.

00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,765
I'm just gonna have to be
a little bit more clever.

00:41:45,765 --> 00:41:48,570
All right.
Do me a favor though.

00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:50,041
Don't get into any trouble.

00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:52,145
You have history up there.

00:41:52,145 --> 00:41:53,448
I wouldn't dream of it.

00:41:53,448 --> 00:41:55,486
Hey, hey, hey, I'm serious.
(phone chimes)

00:41:55,486 --> 00:41:57,290
You be careful.

00:42:01,633 --> 00:42:04,606
All right, I'll call you
as soon as I have something.

00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:06,243
Take care of yourself.

00:42:06,243 --> 00:42:07,646
Always.

00:42:07,646 --> 00:42:09,116
Bye.

00:42:09,116 --> 00:42:09,575
Bye.
