00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,893
Mythology says
that when Castor was killed,

00:04:35,893 --> 00:04:38,732
Pollux went to Zeus
and asked him to let him share

00:04:38,732 --> 00:04:41,638
his own immortality
with his twin.

00:04:41,638 --> 00:04:42,973
To keep them together.

00:04:42,973 --> 00:04:44,310
Zeus agreed,

00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,614
and so they were cast
into heaven.

00:04:46,614 --> 00:04:47,983
The constellation Gemini.

00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:50,889
So cutting off his finger
is part of the message

00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:53,361
that he and his brother
are now one?

00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:55,732
RUSSELL:
He's saying we may
have taken his brother,

00:04:55,732 --> 00:04:57,536
but he's more powerful
than ever.

00:04:57,536 --> 00:05:00,509
All very interesting, you guys,
but here on planet Earth,

00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,647
I thought Winthrop had a partner
while his brother

00:05:02,647 --> 00:05:04,484
was in custody.
Didn't you hear

00:05:04,484 --> 00:05:06,020
another set of footsteps
on the recording

00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,389
of Pamela Kramer's
murder?

00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:08,391
We did.
And you don't think

00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,962
it's Daniel Shaw? I mean,

00:05:09,962 --> 00:05:11,966
come on, this whole thing
with the estranged daughter

00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:13,469
could still have been a setup.

00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:15,340
It was not a setup.
You sure about that?

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,909
I am.
Then why
is Shaw's lawyer

00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:19,080
saying his client
has information on Winthrop

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,785
that he's willing to trade
for a deal?

00:05:21,785 --> 00:05:23,055
It's the first I'm hearing this.

00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:24,691
Yeah, me, too.

00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,030
Guess I need to go talk to Shaw.

00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,633
I checked with World-Send.

00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:30,637
The tracking number
and the bar code were bogus.

00:05:30,637 --> 00:05:33,476
I'm guessing
that Winthrop faked them.

00:05:34,344 --> 00:05:36,081
You got something?

00:05:36,081 --> 00:05:37,417
Yeah, we've seen
this before.

00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:40,023
The strings are made of human
tissue. Take a look there.

00:05:40,023 --> 00:05:42,428
SIDLE: Yeah, thinner gauge
than the trajectory strings

00:05:42,428 --> 00:05:43,830
but same idea.

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,933
We'll have Henry confirm,

00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:46,570
see if DNA can
tell us who it is.

00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,838
Sounds good.

00:05:47,838 --> 00:05:49,475
Hey, let me ask
you something.

00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:50,911
Is this about San Diego?

00:05:50,911 --> 00:05:52,348
Because Finn mentioned
something.

00:05:52,348 --> 00:05:55,087
Yeah, Nolan is stepping down
as the lab director there.

00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:58,727
And, um, he seems to think
I'll make a good replacement.

00:05:58,727 --> 00:06:00,497
Wow. You would.

00:06:00,497 --> 00:06:01,800
Yeah.

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,970
So what's the problem?

00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:03,972
(chuckling):
It's just like I said,

00:06:03,972 --> 00:06:06,509
I have a lot
of friends here, and...

00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:07,645
it's a big responsibility.

00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:08,881
Yeah, but there's a beach.

00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:10,084
And it's a
four-and-a-half-hour drive.

00:06:10,084 --> 00:06:12,388
You'd see me all the time.

00:06:13,524 --> 00:06:14,893
You know, Sara,
after all these years,

00:06:14,893 --> 00:06:17,666
I realize
what's important to me.

00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,438
It's not a promotion.

00:06:20,438 --> 00:06:22,576
Well...

00:06:22,576 --> 00:06:23,978
you know what Grissom would say.

00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:28,554
You gotta go
where you can do the most good.

00:06:32,162 --> 00:06:33,831
SHAW:
This is what
you got, huh?

00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:35,903
How many times I got to
tell you I am not doing this?

00:06:35,903 --> 00:06:37,940
I'm not playing the game.
I don't want a deal.

00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,677
I want to cooperate.
If you can't get that

00:06:39,677 --> 00:06:41,480
through your thick head,
there's the door.

00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,850
Fine.

00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:48,027
Need a new lawyer?
Yeah.

00:06:48,027 --> 00:06:50,700
Looks like I'll be representing
myself from here on in.

00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,570
Yeah, I don't think
that's the best plan.

00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,874
Why break a losing streak?

00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:56,611
So I've heard
that you have information

00:06:56,611 --> 00:06:58,449
that you'd like
to trade for a deal.

00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:00,085
Yeah, that wasn't my
idea. That was

00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:01,955
my lawyer's.

00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:05,629
Besides,
I'd rather talk to you.

00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:06,933
I'm listening.
Look, I know

00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:10,673
your boss, the sheriff, he
thinks that I'm Winthrop's
partner.

00:07:10,673 --> 00:07:11,775
That's just not true.

00:07:11,775 --> 00:07:13,445
I know that.

00:07:13,445 --> 00:07:14,749
But given everything
that happened,

00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:16,686
it's pretty hard
to make that case.

00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,959
Not if you and I can find
the real coconspirator.

00:07:21,763 --> 00:07:23,933
Before Winthrop abducted
my daughter,

00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:26,004
I was working on a lead.
I figured his-his partner

00:07:26,004 --> 00:07:28,041
was helping him get the girls,
the victims.

00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,578
Through the escort service.

00:07:29,578 --> 00:07:30,547
Exactly.

00:07:30,547 --> 00:07:33,085
I thought Rebecca Lowell
ran Lady Aquarius.

00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:33,987
She did.

00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,824
But she had a connection here
in Las Vegas.

00:07:35,824 --> 00:07:39,832
The important thing is
this same guy

00:07:39,832 --> 00:07:42,237
was getting a lot of money
from Winthrop's company.

00:07:42,237 --> 00:07:43,173
Who is it?

00:07:43,173 --> 00:07:45,143
He's not gonna talk to you.

00:07:45,143 --> 00:07:46,078
But he will
speak to me.

00:07:46,078 --> 00:07:48,616
Are you asking me
what I think you're asking me?

00:07:48,616 --> 00:07:51,857
You get me a 48-hour pass,
you and I can nail this guy.

00:07:51,857 --> 00:07:53,794
Sheriff already
doesn't trust you.

00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:56,500
You do. Just a little bit.

00:07:56,967 --> 00:07:58,504
I'm gonna need a name.
Well,

00:07:58,504 --> 00:08:01,242
it's someone you've had a run-in
with before.

00:08:01,242 --> 00:08:03,814
A certain preacher-pimp.

00:08:03,814 --> 00:08:05,852
Goes by the name
of Brother Larson.

00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,822
WOMAN:
<i>I can't go back up there.</i>

00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:10,895
I can't even look at that man.
Calm down.

00:08:10,895 --> 00:08:12,765
Brother Larson is here,
and Brother Larson is listening.

00:08:12,765 --> 00:08:15,204
Now, you tell me,

00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:16,941
did he hurt you?

00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:18,845
No. He didn't touch me.

00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:20,014
And that's just it,
I don't want him

00:08:20,014 --> 00:08:21,683
to touch me.
All right, then let's talk

00:08:21,683 --> 00:08:23,254
about that.

00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:24,724
You don't want him
to touch you how?

00:08:24,724 --> 00:08:26,861
I came to you.
I came to your church

00:08:26,861 --> 00:08:29,199
because I wanted to
get out of the game.

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,936
I don't want to do this anymore.

00:08:30,936 --> 00:08:32,806
I hear you, baby. I feel you.

00:08:32,806 --> 00:08:36,681
But here's the thing.
Here's the Word.

00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:38,251
Our Creator...

00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,190
He's bestowed upon
us gifts. You...

00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,094
have a gift.

00:08:43,094 --> 00:08:46,067
The only shame
there is in life

00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:49,908
is squandering our gifts.
You feel me?

00:08:49,908 --> 00:08:51,778
I guess.

00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:53,615
Here's what we're gonna do.
You're gonna go home,

00:08:53,615 --> 00:08:55,853
get some sleep.

00:08:55,853 --> 00:08:57,757
You're gonna forget
about tonight.

00:08:57,757 --> 00:08:59,160
I will see you in the morning.

00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,032
I'll bring you
some breakfast.

00:09:02,032 --> 00:09:03,970
One more thing.

00:09:05,707 --> 00:09:08,779
Did that man give you
an envelope?

00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,621
Bless you, baby doll.

00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,994
(engine starts)
Get out of here.

00:09:19,301 --> 00:09:21,271
Damn, you're good, Larson.

00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:24,912
And you're taking liberties
with my car.

00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:26,348
Been a while, Daniel.

00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:28,119
I been reading
the papers.

00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:30,991
You been in
the lions' den.

00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:32,695
Surprised to see you.
Police think

00:09:32,695 --> 00:09:34,766
I'm Winthrop's partner.
They think I'm a killer.

00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:36,268
But you know me.
You know that's not true.

00:09:36,268 --> 00:09:37,738
And how would I know that?

00:09:37,738 --> 00:09:39,709
Because I know
about the money.

00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:41,646
I used to help you
and your business in the past.

00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:43,316
Now it's your turn to help me.

00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,754
Unless you want me to give
this information to the police.

00:09:45,754 --> 00:09:48,326
I always liked you, Daniel.

00:09:48,326 --> 00:09:49,929
Always trusted you.

00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:51,199
Until now.

00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:54,172
Tell me something.
Do they shave you down there

00:09:54,172 --> 00:09:55,841
before they tape
that little wire

00:09:55,841 --> 00:09:58,180
onto you?
I'm not wearing a wire.

00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,350
Then I'm guessing...

00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,254
we're not alone.

00:10:02,254 --> 00:10:05,227
You guessed right.
CSI Finlay,
as I recall.

00:10:05,227 --> 00:10:07,164
Was all this really necessary?

00:10:07,164 --> 00:10:09,035
I've always been a friend
of the police.

00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:11,774
I've helped you before.
All you had to do is ask.

00:10:11,774 --> 00:10:13,343
All right,
then I'll ask.

00:10:13,343 --> 00:10:15,782
Are you Winthrop's partner
in all of these murders?

00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,287
Direct. I like that.
The answer's no.

00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:19,890
The cops are
onto the money trail.

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,059
They know you provided
the girls.

00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:22,796
Help us
find Winthrop,

00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:24,366
and maybe you won't get
the death penalty.

00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:27,372
Being misjudged has been
my constant cross to bear.

00:10:27,372 --> 00:10:30,044
Yes, I provided escorts.
It's what I do.

00:10:30,044 --> 00:10:31,714
And I received a finder's fee.

00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,151
Also what I do.

00:10:33,151 --> 00:10:36,190
What I don't do is harm women.
Or anyone.

00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,192
All right?
All right.

00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:38,929
I guess
I'll just have to arrest you.

00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:42,804
H-Hold on a minute. I said
I was gonna help, I'll help.

00:10:42,804 --> 00:10:44,072
The money I got,

00:10:44,072 --> 00:10:45,976
it didn't come from the son.
It came from the father.

00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:47,212
Collin Winthrop.

00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:49,049
In fact, when the first girls
went missing,

00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,953
I suspected
him, but, uh,

00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:55,763
given events, I see now how this
could be a family business.

00:10:55,763 --> 00:10:57,733
You're saying
the father's the partner?

00:10:57,733 --> 00:10:59,069
That'd be my suspicion.

00:10:59,069 --> 00:11:00,172
Sometimes
the apple

00:11:00,172 --> 00:11:01,741
doesn't fall
from the tree at all.

00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:04,848
So say we believe you. Where can
we find Paul Winthrop's father?

00:11:04,848 --> 00:11:07,386
I stopped dealing with
Collin a long time ago.

00:11:07,386 --> 00:11:10,426
I do still receive contributions

00:11:10,426 --> 00:11:12,263
to preserve his good name.

00:11:12,263 --> 00:11:14,133
It's called extortion.

00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,937
That is such an ugly word.

00:11:15,937 --> 00:11:18,108
Look, if you guys want
to arrest me, go ahead,

00:11:18,108 --> 00:11:20,312
but know that my lawyer
will have me out and about

00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,951
in a Las Vegas minute.

00:11:22,951 --> 00:11:25,857
You good? You good?

00:11:25,857 --> 00:11:27,159
Me, too.

00:11:32,003 --> 00:11:33,740
Got your text.

00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,043
Please tell me
you have answers.

00:11:35,043 --> 00:11:38,984
Well, let's start with
the finger in the jar.

00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:40,120
Now, it turns
out the

00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,792
finger was not suspended
in saline and blood--

00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:45,898
as I expected--
but saline and something else.

00:11:45,898 --> 00:11:48,236
I sent it off to
Hodges for analysis.

00:11:48,236 --> 00:11:50,775
And you're sure
that it's

00:11:50,775 --> 00:11:52,377
Paul Winthrop's finger.
It is.

00:11:52,377 --> 00:11:54,081
And the story would end there.

00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:56,152
Except I found blood
on the statuette.
Well,

00:11:56,152 --> 00:11:57,354
Paul Winthrop's blood, right?

00:11:57,354 --> 00:11:59,091
That's what
I thought.

00:11:59,091 --> 00:12:01,028
And because we're
dealing with twins,

00:12:01,028 --> 00:12:02,298
in order to
distinguish them,

00:12:02,298 --> 00:12:04,402
I ran an
antibodies profile.

00:12:04,402 --> 00:12:08,210
Not only was it not Winthrop,
but the sample was female.

00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,481
Two females,
to be exact.

00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:12,987
Identical twins.

00:12:12,987 --> 00:12:14,857
How much blood did you find?
Well, there were only

00:12:14,857 --> 00:12:19,299
a couple of usable traces
for testing, but take a look.

00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,764
He wasn't just
sending us a message.

00:12:34,764 --> 00:12:37,336
Winthrop sent us
a murder weapon.

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,854
You got to be kidding.

00:12:46,854 --> 00:12:48,324
(chuckles)
I know.

00:12:48,324 --> 00:12:50,028
It's not really me, is it?

00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:51,397
Yeah, I picked up these sleeves

00:12:51,397 --> 00:12:53,903
at the costume shop
down the block.

00:12:54,503 --> 00:12:56,140
Just wanted to see what
it would feel like

00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,811
to be a serial killer.

00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:00,883
So I pulled

00:13:00,883 --> 00:13:04,891
the booking photo
of Jared Briscoe's tats.

00:13:04,891 --> 00:13:06,194
Now, this liquid

00:13:06,194 --> 00:13:10,001
that Winthrop sent us his
severed finger in is a mixture

00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:13,242
of saline solution
and Cryers #2 Vermillion Ink.

00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:15,480
Let me guess.
Used in tattoos.

00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,984
Well, not just any tattoos.

00:13:17,984 --> 00:13:19,254
These tattoos.

00:13:19,254 --> 00:13:21,225
I've discovered
in my research that

00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:23,262
certain tattoo artists
are quite particular

00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:25,099
about which inks they use.

00:13:25,099 --> 00:13:27,938
And Cryers #2 Vermillion
is very rare.

00:13:27,938 --> 00:13:29,207
So rare,
in fact,

00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:32,915
that I was able to
identify Briscoe's artist.
Okay,

00:13:32,915 --> 00:13:34,585
but what does that
have to do with

00:13:34,585 --> 00:13:37,357
the jar of ink that
Winthrop sent us?

00:13:37,357 --> 00:13:40,430
Briscoe's artist
lives in Seattle.

00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:44,104
He has an ex-wife
who moved to Vegas last year

00:13:44,104 --> 00:13:47,545
to live with her twin sister.

00:13:47,545 --> 00:13:50,417
Henry found blood on the
Castor and Pollux statuette

00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:53,857
consistent with
identical twins.

00:13:53,857 --> 00:13:55,527
Unknown females.

00:13:55,527 --> 00:13:57,298
Not unknown now.

00:13:57,298 --> 00:13:59,035
I've got names

00:13:59,035 --> 00:14:00,437
and an address.

00:14:00,437 --> 00:14:01,874
Building manager
confirmed

00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,844
the loft's rented
to Amelia Vance.

00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:04,613
What about the sister?

00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:07,418
Name's Margo. She signed
onto the lease a year ago.

00:14:07,418 --> 00:14:09,856
Manager said he stopped by
yesterday 'cause they complained

00:14:09,856 --> 00:14:11,292
the AC wasn't working.

00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:12,996
No one answered.

00:14:17,238 --> 00:14:18,374
Amelia Vance,

00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:19,610
LVPD.

00:14:42,088 --> 00:14:44,594
SIDLE:
Another processed crime scene.

00:14:52,443 --> 00:14:55,081
Strings and blood
suggest two events.

00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:56,551
Two victims.

00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,359
Again, he took
the bodies.

00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:05,102
Russell's theory

00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:06,638
was right.

00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:11,682
Winthrop and his brother
have become one.

00:15:11,682 --> 00:15:13,318
Dead ringers.

00:15:16,926 --> 00:15:19,130
Just like old times.

00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,469
Everything's been dusted,
everything's already processed.

00:15:21,469 --> 00:15:23,138
Something is different
this time.

00:15:23,138 --> 00:15:24,441
What do you mean?

00:15:24,441 --> 00:15:26,177
Well, not everything's
been dusted,

00:15:26,177 --> 00:15:28,216
and these green strings--

00:15:28,216 --> 00:15:30,085
Gemini?

00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:33,025
He didn't even try to hide them
among the other strings.

00:15:33,025 --> 00:15:34,461
Different murder weapon, too.

00:15:34,461 --> 00:15:35,597
No gaff. This time,

00:15:35,597 --> 00:15:37,701
he bludgeoned them to death
with a marble sculpture.

00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:39,671
And this rope he used?

00:15:39,671 --> 00:15:42,043
Never seen anything like it.

00:15:42,043 --> 00:15:43,613
Looks hand-braided.

00:15:43,613 --> 00:15:45,049
Unusual fiber.

00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:49,057
Some kind of powdery trace
on it. It's yellow.

00:15:49,057 --> 00:15:52,498
It looks organic in nature.
Suggests secondary transfer.

00:15:52,498 --> 00:15:54,569
How's it going
with your new toy?

00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:56,205
Oh, camera's
acquired the image.

00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,310
Just loading it now.

00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,481
So this thing is gonna
give us T.O.D.

00:16:00,481 --> 00:16:02,618
on our victims?
Well,

00:16:02,618 --> 00:16:05,090
it's worth a try.
We've had this

00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,996
hyperspectral imaging prototype
in the lab for over a month.

00:16:07,996 --> 00:16:09,666
I've been waiting
to field-test it.

00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,603
How's it work, exactly?
Well,

00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:14,008
it's all about the hemoglobin
in the blood.

00:16:14,008 --> 00:16:16,012
As a bloodstain ages,

00:16:16,012 --> 00:16:18,317
the blood reacts with oxygen
and breaks down.

00:16:18,317 --> 00:16:20,087
Right, which is why
blood changes color

00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:21,556
from red to brown.
Well, this

00:16:21,556 --> 00:16:24,062
camera records those changes.

00:16:24,062 --> 00:16:25,565
And then maps them on a visible

00:16:25,565 --> 00:16:27,201
reflectance spectrum.

00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:29,038
So here is

00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:30,642
the crime scene blood drop.
I'm comparing it

00:16:30,642 --> 00:16:33,715
to a preset baseline
of a fresh blood drop.

00:16:33,715 --> 00:16:36,554
Software
does the rest.

00:16:36,554 --> 00:16:40,095
Calculating the difference
between the two spectra, thereby

00:16:40,095 --> 00:16:41,230
computing the age of the blood.

00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,399
Wow.

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,372
Oh. And...
we got our answer.

00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:47,643
The murders took place...

00:16:47,643 --> 00:16:49,413
12 hours ago.

00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:51,584
So something is different.
Yeah, I mean,

00:16:51,584 --> 00:16:54,323
the other murders
took place weeks before
we discovered

00:16:54,323 --> 00:16:55,626
the crime scenes.
And he took days

00:16:55,626 --> 00:16:59,433
to stage them. Winthrop
has accelerated his time frame.

00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:01,203
But why?

00:17:06,515 --> 00:17:08,519
If anything holds
from the past,

00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:11,191
I'm sure he's
eager to tell us.

00:17:11,191 --> 00:17:14,064
DISTORTED VOICE:
Clearly, our killer's
behavior has altered.

00:17:14,064 --> 00:17:15,833
Two victims this time.

00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,539
Female. Not college age.

00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,443
Selected for other purposes.

00:17:20,443 --> 00:17:22,480
One being a tattoo artist.

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,284
Elementary profiling would say

00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:26,188
the killer's
psychosexual fixation

00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:29,729
has given way
to a transformative agenda.

00:17:29,729 --> 00:17:32,400
WINTHROP:
Is that what you'd say,
Mr. Russell?

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,170
Games are over, right?
We can finally

00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,208
be honest with each other.

00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,145
I'm sure you've
realized your mistake.

00:17:38,145 --> 00:17:40,384
It's one others have made.

00:17:40,384 --> 00:17:41,719
From the very beginning,
this world

00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:43,790
tried to separate Jared and me.

00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:47,331
So many have paid
for that injustice.

00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:50,704
But those truly responsible
have escaped our wrath.

00:17:50,704 --> 00:17:52,474
Until now.

00:17:52,474 --> 00:17:55,080
So I ran audio analysis.
There's no evidence

00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,151
of anyone else on the recording.

00:17:57,151 --> 00:17:59,355
He has to have
somebody else helping him.

00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:01,259
And it's not
his brother's ghost.
Right,

00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:03,163
I mean, the guy was wounded.

00:18:03,163 --> 00:18:05,500
So he had to lay low.
Somebody's been hiding him.

00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,271
Mm-hmm.
He also doesn't
have any access

00:18:07,271 --> 00:18:09,609
to his bank accounts, so...

00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:11,380
somebody has to be
supporting him.

00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,686
Larson says that it's
Winthrop's father, Collin.

00:18:14,686 --> 00:18:16,457
Do you believe him?

00:18:16,457 --> 00:18:17,392
All right,

00:18:17,392 --> 00:18:20,798
I'm going to follow up
on both of them.

00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:23,370
You were right about the rope
from the crime scene.

00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:27,345
It's unusual. Definitely
not your standard bondage gear.

00:18:27,345 --> 00:18:29,216
If anything,
it tends more

00:18:29,216 --> 00:18:31,453
towards a fetish
of gardening.

00:18:31,453 --> 00:18:32,622
Gardening?

00:18:32,622 --> 00:18:36,698
You are looking here
at a handwoven plant fiber.

00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,837
Specifically
<i>Apocynum cannabinium.</i>

00:18:39,837 --> 00:18:41,541
Otherwise known as dogbane.

00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,144
It's an invasive species.

00:18:43,144 --> 00:18:44,847
Grows like a weed
almost anywhere.

00:18:44,847 --> 00:18:46,651
So, not particularly helpful.

00:18:46,651 --> 00:18:48,154
No. But...

00:18:48,154 --> 00:18:51,160
the trace that you
pulled from the rope--

00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,930
that's a different story.

00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:56,738
You were also right--
it's organic.

00:18:56,738 --> 00:18:58,842
These are pollen spores

00:18:58,842 --> 00:19:01,648
from a cactus
called the Artemis bloom.

00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:04,187
Artemis.
Goddess of the hunt.

00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:07,159
Artemis was also the daughter
of Zeus, twin sister

00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:09,397
to Apollo.
So I'm thinking

00:19:09,397 --> 00:19:11,702
that perhaps it's
another message.
Probably.

00:19:11,702 --> 00:19:13,639
Is there anything more
you can tell me about the plant?

00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:15,577
Uh, the Artemis
bloom is very rare,

00:19:15,577 --> 00:19:18,850
very delicate and
also very expensive.

00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,887
It's the ultimate
hothouse flower.

00:19:20,887 --> 00:19:22,924
Prized only by
serious enthusiasts

00:19:22,924 --> 00:19:23,826
with deep pockets.

00:19:23,826 --> 00:19:26,265
Now you're talking.
And you're thinking

00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:29,171
that if Winthrop isn't
our flower enthusiast,

00:19:29,171 --> 00:19:30,874
perhaps he's spending
time with someone who is.

00:19:30,874 --> 00:19:33,412
Maybe his partner.

00:19:33,846 --> 00:19:35,483
FINLAY:
Collin Winthrop.

00:19:35,483 --> 00:19:38,289
Wealthy recluse, plant hobbyist.

00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:39,558
Who spawned a bad seed.

00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:41,595
Looks like our weekend
botanist had some practice.

00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:43,867
Yeah, not just cultivating
the sick impulses

00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:44,969
of his son, but seems

00:19:44,969 --> 00:19:46,706
to have some of his own.

00:19:46,706 --> 00:19:49,311
2006. Legal secretary

00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:51,348
accused him of sexual assault.

00:19:51,348 --> 00:19:53,587
Case never
went to trial.

00:19:53,587 --> 00:19:56,293
Rumors of more women
and more allegations.

00:19:56,293 --> 00:19:56,993
Well, Larson's
theory

00:19:56,993 --> 00:19:59,432
about Winthrop Sr.
is getting better and better.

00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:00,834
Mm. There's just
one problem.

00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:03,774
Says here that he
reportedly fled to Mexico.

00:20:03,774 --> 00:20:06,880
Which means that he could
still help his son from afar,

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,220
but couldn't participate
in the murders.

00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,660
Unless Dad never
left the country.

00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,629
These are my files, right?

00:20:14,629 --> 00:20:16,399
The ones from my hotel room
after I was arrested?

00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:17,535
Yeah, why?

00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,805
What have you got?
Well, like I said,

00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:20,809
I was following the money.
I was looking into the Winthrop

00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:23,447
company financials.
I remember a series

00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:24,984
of transactions,
donations to a

00:20:24,984 --> 00:20:29,360
nature conservancy. I thought
it was a front, but...

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,662
Here it is.

00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,632
Tax records show there
actually was a charity

00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:35,572
devoted to the preservation
of exotic plant species.

00:20:35,572 --> 00:20:36,607
How much you want
to bet that money

00:20:36,607 --> 00:20:39,680
went straight into
Papa Winthrop's pockets?

00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,548
Place is in

00:20:40,548 --> 00:20:42,452
Briar Creek,
California.

00:20:42,452 --> 00:20:43,621
San Diego County's

00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:45,558
a little out of your
jurisdiction.

00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:48,932
You know, I think I know a guy
who knows a guy.

00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:06,501
(sighs)

00:21:06,501 --> 00:21:08,605
Hey, Finlay, what's your 20?

00:21:08,605 --> 00:21:10,776
Shaw and I are about
five minutes out.

00:21:10,776 --> 00:21:11,912
All right, I'm gonna
get the lay of the land

00:21:11,912 --> 00:21:13,449
out here and I'll
call you back.

00:21:13,449 --> 00:21:14,417
Copy that.

00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:16,421
You Ellis?
Yes, sir.

00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:17,858
Good to meet you,
CSI Stokes.

00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:20,296
(chuckles)
Call me Nick, please.

00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:21,498
I got it.

00:21:21,498 --> 00:21:23,770
Lab Director Nolan said
to extend you every courtesy.

00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,805
Did he?
And from what I hear,

00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:26,776
I may be working for you
full-time soon.

00:21:26,776 --> 00:21:28,378
Oh, we'll see about that.

00:21:28,378 --> 00:21:29,982
What's the situation out here?

00:21:29,982 --> 00:21:31,752
We've got
the place surrounded.

00:21:31,752 --> 00:21:33,088
Warrants in hand.

00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:35,326
There's no activity
in the main house.

00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:37,664
But we have eyes
on Collin Winthrop.

00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,967
He's working in
the greenhouse.

00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:39,902
What about Paul?

00:21:39,902 --> 00:21:42,508
No sign of him.
But my money's on

00:21:42,508 --> 00:21:45,547
the guesthouse. Shades are
drawn, place is secluded,

00:21:45,547 --> 00:21:47,518
and has easy access
to the back gate.

00:21:47,518 --> 00:21:49,355
Okay, why don't you and I
take the guesthouse.

00:21:49,355 --> 00:21:50,857
We'll have your team
search the property.

00:21:50,857 --> 00:21:54,064
When my guys get here,
they'll take Daddy Winthrop.

00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:01,379
Collin Winthrop.

00:22:01,379 --> 00:22:03,483
I'm CSI Finlay, LVPD.

00:22:03,483 --> 00:22:04,385
I have a warrant

00:22:04,385 --> 00:22:05,955
to search your property.

00:22:05,955 --> 00:22:07,458
No warrant
for my arrest?

00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,761
SHAW: Depends on
what we find.

00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:11,700
What do you expect to find?
Your son.

00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,569
Uh-huh.

00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:13,737
SHAW: Maybe some evidence
linking the two of you

00:22:13,737 --> 00:22:16,443
to the five women
who were murdered in Las Vegas.

00:22:16,443 --> 00:22:17,545
My son and I
are innocent.

00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:19,516
We are the
victims here.
Oh, yeah.

00:22:19,516 --> 00:22:20,885
How do you figure that?

00:22:20,885 --> 00:22:24,693
Well, Paul and I share
a natural appetite for...

00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:26,864
certain pleasures.

00:22:26,864 --> 00:22:29,636
Society may not approve,

00:22:29,636 --> 00:22:31,106
and the law may attempt
to prohibit, but when

00:22:31,106 --> 00:22:33,510
they are both impotent
to stop us,

00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,616
we are accused
of brutalities.

00:22:35,616 --> 00:22:38,555
Is that why you
fled to Mexico?

00:22:38,555 --> 00:22:40,391
It's not a crime for a man

00:22:40,391 --> 00:22:41,961
to want to abandon his life
for a time

00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:46,003
and wander in the desert
in search of beauty.

00:22:46,003 --> 00:22:46,938
Like you see here.

00:22:46,938 --> 00:22:49,543
Mr. Winthrop, where is your son?
You know...

00:22:49,543 --> 00:22:51,147
if you're not going
to arrest me,

00:22:51,147 --> 00:22:54,820
I would like you two to leave.

Did you scramble
the search team?

00:25:26,061 --> 00:25:28,165
Got every
available unit on it.

00:25:28,165 --> 00:25:29,969
The problem is,
Winthrop probably knows

00:25:29,969 --> 00:25:31,973
this area better
than any of us.

00:25:31,973 --> 00:25:33,643
Yep.

Uh, Nick, uh,
just processed the gun.

still no sign

00:26:06,142 --> 00:26:08,079
to, uh, transport it all
back to Vegas.

00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:10,116
No, no. You need
to get back here now, Jules.

00:26:10,116 --> 00:26:11,987
I told you, I'm okay.

00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,159
No, you're lucky--
Winthrop's beyond targeting

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,294
college girls now.

00:26:15,294 --> 00:26:17,732
He shot his father,
and he tried to kill you.

00:26:17,732 --> 00:26:19,035
This is getting personal.

00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,805
I agree with Conrad.

00:26:20,805 --> 00:26:22,642
All right, I will transport

00:26:22,642 --> 00:26:24,612
Shaw's body and the others
back to Doc.

00:26:24,612 --> 00:26:25,648
All right,

00:26:25,648 --> 00:26:27,118
but afterwards,
you go straight home.

00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:28,287
No arguments.

00:26:33,798 --> 00:26:36,403
I confirmed C.O.D.'s
on our female victims.

00:26:36,403 --> 00:26:38,073
Blunt force trauma
to the head.

00:26:38,073 --> 00:26:40,044
Women had so
many fractures

00:26:40,044 --> 00:26:41,781
to the body and skull,
I almost lost count.

00:26:41,781 --> 00:26:44,954
ROBBINS:
It's not just
the blunt force trauma--

00:26:44,954 --> 00:26:47,760
Winthrop's M.O.'s seemed
to have changed as well.

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,028
With his earlier victims,

00:26:49,028 --> 00:26:51,134
there's no sign
of sexual activity.

00:26:51,134 --> 00:26:52,236
You found semen?

00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:54,106
Yeah. On both victims.

00:26:54,106 --> 00:26:56,778
ROBBINS:
Latent bruising
plus the ligature marks

00:26:56,778 --> 00:26:58,983
suggest, at the very least,
rough sex.
All right,

00:26:58,983 --> 00:27:01,387
let's get the DNA
to Henry.

00:27:20,193 --> 00:27:22,931
Hello?
Hi, Mrs. Devlin.

00:27:22,931 --> 00:27:24,801
My name is Julie Finlay.

00:27:24,801 --> 00:27:27,273
I work with the Las Vegas
Police Department.

00:27:27,273 --> 00:27:29,744
Uh, I need to speak
with your granddaughter, Amy.

00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:32,985
It's about her dad.

00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:36,993
What'd you get?

00:27:36,993 --> 00:27:40,333
So, Collin Winthrop had
extensive HD surveillance

00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:42,972
at his house,
all over the property.

00:27:42,972 --> 00:27:45,209
I mean, it's no surprise that
cameras caught Paul Winthrop

00:27:45,209 --> 00:27:46,311
in his guesthouse, but...

00:27:46,311 --> 00:27:48,249
this is what
I wanted you to see.

00:27:49,952 --> 00:27:53,960
RUSSELL:
That's Collin Winthrop, right?

00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,697
Who's he arguing with?

00:27:55,697 --> 00:27:57,268
BRODY:
Our friend, Brother Larson.

00:27:57,268 --> 00:27:59,138
RUSSELL:
That son of a bitch.

00:27:59,138 --> 00:28:01,977
He told us that he had
stopped having dealings

00:28:01,977 --> 00:28:03,213
with Winthrop Sr.

00:28:03,213 --> 00:28:04,248
BRODY:
Could be we've been wrong.

00:28:04,248 --> 00:28:05,450
Paul Winthrop had more

00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,488
than one coconspirator.
It would help

00:28:07,488 --> 00:28:09,158
if we knew what they
were talking about,

00:28:09,158 --> 00:28:11,062
but obviously,
that's impossible.

00:28:11,062 --> 00:28:13,801
This is gonna sound crazy...

00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:16,807
but maybe the plants
can help us.

00:28:16,807 --> 00:28:19,479
Thanks to the wealth
of digital recordings

00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:21,417
that Winthrop has
been leaving for us,

00:28:21,417 --> 00:28:22,852
Sara and I requisitioned

00:28:22,852 --> 00:28:25,291
every audio analysis
program on the planet.

00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:28,029
Including one
that listens to plants?

00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:31,403
This one tracks minute
vibrations of all sorts

00:28:31,403 --> 00:28:33,507
of different objects
in a space,

00:28:33,507 --> 00:28:36,080
and analyzes the sounds
that created them.

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,088
Okay, I-I get that the sound of
a voice can vibrate the leaves,

00:28:40,088 --> 00:28:43,427
but if you can't even see it,
then how do you measure it?

00:28:43,427 --> 00:28:47,068
Well, this is where the
impossible becomes possible.

00:28:47,068 --> 00:28:48,170
This software is able

00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:52,379
to detect motion less than
one 100th of a pixel.

00:28:52,379 --> 00:28:56,220
<i>By combining and filtering</i>
<i>all that minute motion</i>

00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,124
<i>over the image, it can actually</i>

00:28:58,124 --> 00:29:00,429
<i>recover the sound</i>
<i>of their voices.</i>

00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:03,235
I'm impressed.

00:29:03,235 --> 00:29:05,372
I am tired of the blackmail.

00:29:05,372 --> 00:29:06,441
I'm tired of the lies.

00:29:06,441 --> 00:29:09,280
I am not lying.
I'm telling you, I don't know.

00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,382
Oh, you know.
You've always known.

00:29:10,382 --> 00:29:11,886
Now, where is she?

00:29:11,886 --> 00:29:13,221
LARSON:
That's not the reason
I came here.

00:29:13,221 --> 00:29:15,292
No, you came here
for money, as usual,

00:29:15,292 --> 00:29:16,561
and you're not gonna
get another cent

00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:19,000
until you tell me
where my daughter is!

00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,402
I-I know, you think
I'm gonna hurt her.

00:29:20,402 --> 00:29:21,839
LARSON:
Like you did before.

00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:24,343
Oh, that's all in the past.
I'm talking about now.

00:29:24,343 --> 00:29:27,249
I'm talking about Paul.
He's figured it out.

00:29:27,249 --> 00:29:29,120
He knows who May really is.

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,224
And I need to protect her,
'cause if he finds her,

00:29:31,224 --> 00:29:32,093
he's gonna kill her.

00:29:32,093 --> 00:29:33,830
He'll never find her,
and neither will--

00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:38,239
LARSON:
And you got all that
from a plant?

00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:40,944
Yeah, don't worry about it.

00:29:40,944 --> 00:29:43,282
You know, I agree
with Winthrop.

00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:46,021
I'm tired of all the lies.

00:29:46,021 --> 00:29:48,827
Based on that conversation,
I did a little digging

00:29:48,827 --> 00:29:51,031
around the Winthrop family tree.

00:29:51,031 --> 00:29:53,569
And it turns out that
Collin Winthrop had a daughter.

00:29:53,569 --> 00:29:55,373
May.

00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:59,081
May went missing
around age 15.

00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:02,187
Police at the time determined
that she was not kidnapped.

00:30:02,187 --> 00:30:03,590
She just ran away.

00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,327
And, Brother Larson,

00:30:05,327 --> 00:30:09,202
I think you know
where she ran to.

00:30:09,202 --> 00:30:11,105
Hmm. I do not.
Look,

00:30:11,105 --> 00:30:14,044
I gave you a "get out
of jail free" card last time

00:30:14,044 --> 00:30:16,183
because you helped me.
If you do not

00:30:16,183 --> 00:30:18,587
come clean here, I promise you,

00:30:18,587 --> 00:30:20,424
it's gonna go the other way.

00:30:21,994 --> 00:30:25,367
I guess confession is
good for the soul.

00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:28,540
(clears his throat)

00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,213
I'm gonna tell you
a little story.

00:30:31,213 --> 00:30:33,283
Not a pretty one.

00:30:33,283 --> 00:30:35,354
About a young girl, 15.

00:30:35,354 --> 00:30:38,561
Innocent... or so it seemed.

00:30:38,561 --> 00:30:40,498
Pregnant,

00:30:40,498 --> 00:30:43,271
she ran off to a convent.

00:30:43,271 --> 00:30:47,079
There she gave birth
to twin boys, Paul and Jared.

00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,216
But she didn't want them.

00:30:49,216 --> 00:30:51,487
More than that, though,

00:30:51,487 --> 00:30:54,093
she didn't want her father
to lay claim to them,

00:30:54,093 --> 00:30:58,034
because... they were his blood.

00:30:58,034 --> 00:31:01,173
You're-you're saying
that Paul and Jared

00:31:01,173 --> 00:31:03,044
were the product of incest?

00:31:03,044 --> 00:31:04,446
Yes.

00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:07,185
Now, May hid behind a name,

00:31:07,185 --> 00:31:09,624
<i>Nancy Harper,</i>
<i>just like she hid the boys.</i>

00:31:09,624 --> 00:31:13,932
<i>She found a home for Jared,</i>
<i>but Paul was sickly.</i>

00:31:13,932 --> 00:31:17,105
<i>She tried to buy time</i>
<i>by pretending he died, but</i>

00:31:17,105 --> 00:31:19,076
Collin found Paul.

00:31:19,076 --> 00:31:20,680
Raised him.

00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,654
But he never found Jared...
or May.

00:31:24,654 --> 00:31:26,591
She vanished.

00:31:28,329 --> 00:31:30,499
You're pathetic, you know that?

00:31:30,499 --> 00:31:32,437
We ran your DNA.

00:31:32,437 --> 00:31:35,443
It's a familial match
to Paul Winthrop.

00:31:35,443 --> 00:31:40,119
So, you can forget
your <i>Chinatown</i> story.

00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:43,960
You are the father
of Paul and Jared.

00:31:47,434 --> 00:31:49,438
You want the truth?

00:31:49,438 --> 00:31:52,411
A lie can be a powerful thing.

00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:56,219
It can be used to deceive.
It can be used to protect.

00:31:56,219 --> 00:31:58,123
I admit I deceived you,

00:31:58,123 --> 00:32:01,195
but I only did it
to protect May.

00:32:01,195 --> 00:32:03,566
I had nothing
to do with these murders.

00:32:03,566 --> 00:32:06,672
Come on, Mr. Russell.

00:32:06,672 --> 00:32:08,677
You know what
this is all about?

00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:14,388
Paul Winthrop has been killing
his mother over and over,

00:32:14,388 --> 00:32:16,092
getting ready
for his End of Days.

00:32:16,092 --> 00:32:18,531
And with Jared gone,

00:32:18,531 --> 00:32:21,269
that time has come.

00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:23,274
Paul will find May.

00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,278
He will render judgment.

00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:27,582
Unless you protect her.

00:32:27,582 --> 00:32:30,488
As, apparently, I no longer can.

00:32:30,488 --> 00:32:32,592
Okay.

00:32:32,592 --> 00:32:34,596
If I'm gonna protect May,

00:32:34,596 --> 00:32:36,600
I need to know where she is.

00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,204
You already do.

00:32:38,204 --> 00:32:40,141
The convent

00:32:40,141 --> 00:32:42,011
she ran off to,
she never left it.

00:32:42,011 --> 00:32:45,384
<i>Your CSI Finlay--</i>
<i>she's met May.</i>

00:32:46,621 --> 00:32:49,192
Or should I say...

00:32:49,192 --> 00:32:51,163
Sister Alice.

00:32:51,731 --> 00:32:54,604
Every time I talk to that guy,
I feel like I need a shower.

00:32:54,604 --> 00:32:57,008
I don't even know why I bother
to believe him anymore.

00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,578
I keep thinking about
what Winthrop said to you

00:32:58,578 --> 00:33:00,749
on the digital recorder--
that so many have paid

00:33:00,749 --> 00:33:03,255
for the injustice
done to him and Jared.

00:33:03,255 --> 00:33:05,425
"And yet, those
who are truly responsible

00:33:05,425 --> 00:33:08,331
have escaped his wrath
until now."
Think about it.

00:33:08,331 --> 00:33:10,469
He killed Collin Winthrop,
he tried to kill Finn.

00:33:10,469 --> 00:33:13,241
At some point, he's probably
gonna come after you.

00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,247
Yeah, but top of his list
has to be his mother

00:33:16,247 --> 00:33:18,418
who abandoned him
and his brother, right?

00:33:18,418 --> 00:33:19,588
Not only abandoned them.

00:33:19,588 --> 00:33:22,627
Separated them,
cast them adrift.

00:33:22,627 --> 00:33:24,498
Yeah, you know what?

00:33:24,498 --> 00:33:27,470
She's the way
we're gonna catch this guy.

00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:31,712
Okay, okay, so, Finn and I will
go up to Seattle.

00:33:31,712 --> 00:33:35,219
We'll put this Sister Alice
into protective custody.

00:33:35,219 --> 00:33:37,223
Use her as bait.
Right.

00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,361
Do me a favor.
Call Seattle PD.

00:33:39,361 --> 00:33:41,365
Let's get eyes
on the convent.

00:33:41,365 --> 00:33:44,171
I'll pick up Finn
on the way to the airport.

00:33:50,416 --> 00:33:53,322
Jules, it's me.

00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:57,130
Hey, Jules, come on, open up.

00:34:06,683 --> 00:34:09,222
(door creaks open)

00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:15,634
(screaming)

00:34:20,511 --> 00:34:22,148
WINTHROP:
Hello, Mr. Russell.

00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:27,158
Jared and I have been
waiting for you.

00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:37,278
What have you done?

00:34:37,278 --> 00:34:39,316
Isn't it obvious?
She's dead.

00:34:41,654 --> 00:34:44,426
Easy! Easy, now.

00:34:44,426 --> 00:34:45,829
Let's not rush this.

00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:47,566
Yeah, copy that, Nick.
As soon as you

00:34:47,566 --> 00:34:49,369
wrap things up in San Diego,
I need you back here.

00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:51,340
Russell and Finn are
on their way to Seattle.

00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,177
All right. Yeah, call me
when you're on the road.

00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:54,580
Hey. Seattle PD called back.

00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,750
They went to the convent.

00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,918
No sign of Sister Alice.

00:34:56,918 --> 00:34:58,621
Nuns have no idea where she is.

00:34:58,621 --> 00:34:59,791
Did you tell Russell?

00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:01,427
I tried calling him
and Finn. I can't

00:35:01,427 --> 00:35:03,264
get a hold of either of them.
Do you know where they are?

00:35:03,264 --> 00:35:04,667
They're supposed to be
on their way up north,

00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:05,636
but I got a bad feeling.

00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:08,609
Listen, find Greg, then
meet me at Finn's condo.

00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,346
Okay.

00:35:10,346 --> 00:35:12,350
(groaning)

00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:15,222
Aah! You sick bastard!

00:35:15,222 --> 00:35:17,260
How does it feel...

00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,529
to lose someone you love,

00:35:18,529 --> 00:35:20,866
to have your heart
ripped away from you?

00:35:20,866 --> 00:35:22,570
Oh, I know what you're thinking.

00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,909
Was it quick? Did she suffer?

00:35:24,909 --> 00:35:26,545
Did she scream?
You're the expert.

00:35:26,545 --> 00:35:27,780
What does the crime scene
tell you?

00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,356
Look at it.

00:35:46,752 --> 00:35:49,291
I want you to know
she suffered.

00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:51,495
She begged
for me to end it.

00:35:53,566 --> 00:35:55,837
I don't believe you.

00:35:55,837 --> 00:35:56,873
You wanted me

00:35:56,873 --> 00:35:59,411
to take a look
at your crime scene?

00:35:59,411 --> 00:36:00,848
The blood gives you away.

00:36:00,848 --> 00:36:04,355
That's hardly a lethal loss
of blood, wouldn't you say?

00:36:04,355 --> 00:36:06,727
And where's
the spatter?

00:36:06,727 --> 00:36:07,896
Come on, where's the spatter?
You haven't even

00:36:07,896 --> 00:36:09,531
put up all your strings.

00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,269
You weren't
waiting for me.

00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,206
I interrupted you
before you were finished.

00:36:13,206 --> 00:36:14,676
Where's Finlay?

00:36:14,676 --> 00:36:15,978
Where is she?

00:36:22,692 --> 00:36:23,827
What do you got?

00:36:23,827 --> 00:36:25,331
Russell and Finlay's
vehicles are here.

00:36:25,331 --> 00:36:26,500
They're still
not answering.

00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,270
I'll have my men
secure the building.

00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,372
Then we'll move
in tactically.

00:36:29,372 --> 00:36:30,574
Let's do it.

00:36:30,574 --> 00:36:31,910
WINTHROP:
Finlay is dead.

00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,747
I told you. She's already buried
in the desert

00:36:33,747 --> 00:36:35,618
where you will never find her.

00:36:35,618 --> 00:36:36,854
You're gonna tell me
where she is.

00:36:36,854 --> 00:36:39,392
I don't really think you're
in a position to negotiate here.

00:36:39,392 --> 00:36:41,596
You've been looking
for your mom, haven't you?

00:36:41,596 --> 00:36:42,833
I know

00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,870
who she is, Paul,
and I know where she is.

00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,408
You're lying.
Even my father didn't know that.

00:36:47,408 --> 00:36:49,747
That's 'cause your father's
not Collin Winthrop.

00:36:49,747 --> 00:36:51,684
Your father was a pimp

00:36:51,684 --> 00:36:56,026
who got a 15-year-old girl
pregnant with bastard twins.

00:36:56,026 --> 00:36:56,928
You and your brother.

00:36:56,928 --> 00:36:58,565
I should kill you now.

00:36:58,565 --> 00:36:59,800
You do that,

00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,804
and you'll never know.

00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:03,641
Where is she?
Where's my mother?!

00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:05,779
You tell me where Finlay is.

00:37:05,779 --> 00:37:07,816
I'll tell you
where your mother is.

00:37:07,816 --> 00:37:10,422
What's it gonna
be, Paul?

00:37:11,624 --> 00:37:13,395
No!

00:37:13,395 --> 00:37:16,000
(Winthrop gasps)
He knows where Finlay is.

00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:19,273
Where is she?
Where is Finlay?

00:37:19,273 --> 00:37:20,910
You'll never find her in time.

00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,614
She's still alive.
She's got to be close.

00:37:22,614 --> 00:37:24,818
He said he was gonna
take her to the desert.

00:37:24,818 --> 00:37:26,020
He has to get her there somehow.

00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,724
Greg, Morgan, where are you?

00:37:27,724 --> 00:37:29,327
We just rolled up.
In the garage.

00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:30,730
SIDLE:
We need to find
Winthrop's vehicle.

00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,934
We believe it's on the premises.
Start canvassing.

00:37:32,934 --> 00:37:34,304
Start running plates.

00:37:34,304 --> 00:37:35,506
SANDERS:
Copy that.

00:37:35,506 --> 00:37:36,842
Where is she?

00:37:36,842 --> 00:37:39,414
Can you hear me? Where is she?!

00:37:39,414 --> 00:37:41,351
MAN:
All right, that vehicle's
a negative. Next one.

00:37:41,351 --> 00:37:42,620
BRODY:
Vehicle is a black

00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,526
Lincoln Continental,
Nevada plates.

00:37:45,526 --> 00:37:47,798
Plate number HRGK-698.

00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,334
That car was reported stolen

00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:51,639
from the California-Nevada
state line.

00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:54,077
Greg, take a look at this.

00:37:54,077 --> 00:37:56,483
This car was stolen this morning

00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:57,952
from the California state line.

00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,964
Oh, my God.

00:38:03,964 --> 00:38:06,436
It's Finn.

00:38:06,436 --> 00:38:08,573
Come on, Finn.
Come on.

00:38:10,777 --> 00:38:12,481
I can't find a pulse,

00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:13,884
but she's still warm.

00:38:15,354 --> 00:38:16,789
Call medevac.
Yeah.

00:38:16,789 --> 00:38:19,662
This is CSI Morgan
Brody, requesting

How you doing?

00:39:05,889 --> 00:39:09,430
One day at time.
Isn't that what they say?

00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,401
So, I was just up
at the hospital,

00:39:11,401 --> 00:39:12,603
and the nurse there told me

00:39:12,603 --> 00:39:14,440
you've been going
up there every weekend.

00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,811
Yeah, she's just not responsive.

00:39:16,811 --> 00:39:19,550
I mean, her body's healing,

00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,653
but they just
can't say

00:39:20,653 --> 00:39:23,025

regain consciousness.

00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,099
Or if she will.

00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:30,139
Well, one thing we do know is
that Winthrop is gonna recover,

00:39:30,139 --> 00:39:32,209
and when he does, he's gonna pay
for what he's done.

00:39:32,209 --> 00:39:34,480
Right?
Yeah.

00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:39,023
Did Lab Director Nolan call you
about that job?

00:39:39,023 --> 00:39:40,894
Oh. I'm so sorry.

00:39:40,894 --> 00:39:42,497
Yeah, he did. He did, yeah.

00:39:42,497 --> 00:39:44,100
Congratulations.
I hear you're gonna take it.

00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,439
I was. I think
I'm gonna call him back,

00:39:46,439 --> 00:39:47,641
tell him to hold off on that

00:39:47,641 --> 00:39:48,543
for a little bit.

00:39:48,543 --> 00:39:51,048
No, no, no, no.
Come on, sit-sit down.

00:39:51,048 --> 00:39:52,784
Just give me...
give me one second.

00:39:52,784 --> 00:39:56,025
Now... why would
you do that?

00:39:56,025 --> 00:39:58,463
It's just not the right time.

00:39:58,463 --> 00:40:01,837
Not right now, not with
what's going on with Julie.

Whatever happens with Jules--

00:40:05,443 --> 00:40:07,782
there's nothing
you and I can do about that.

00:40:08,984 --> 00:40:11,523
But if she was sitting
in that chair right now,

00:40:11,523 --> 00:40:13,226
she would tell you
to get your ass

00:40:13,226 --> 00:40:16,466
on that plane to San Diego,
and you know it.

00:40:18,937 --> 00:40:21,476
You need to do this, bud.

00:40:34,669 --> 00:40:36,506
You're not trying to sneak
out of here, are you?

00:40:36,506 --> 00:40:37,508
(laughs)

00:40:37,508 --> 00:40:40,047
No, I wouldn't do something
like that to you.

Wow.

00:40:41,516 --> 00:40:43,922
