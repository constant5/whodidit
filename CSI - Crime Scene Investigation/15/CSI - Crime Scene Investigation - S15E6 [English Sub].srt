00:00:00,969 --> 00:00:02,239
RUSSELL:
<i>Previously on</i> CSI...

00:00:02,239 --> 00:00:04,978
FINLAY: <i>Jared Briscoe,</i>
<i>the Gig Harbor Killer.</i>

00:00:04,978 --> 00:00:05,419
<i>Murdered seven women.</i>

00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:07,182
RUSSELL:
<i>He took the bodies.</i>

00:00:07,182 --> 00:00:10,489
<i>Left processed crime scenes</i>
<i>for us to find.</i>

00:00:10,489 --> 00:00:12,760
We're investigating
the disappearance of my partner,

00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,030
<i>Keri Torres.</i>

00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,702
I have been enlisted
to defend a man

00:00:16,702 --> 00:00:18,506
<i>who has been</i>
<i>wrongfully imprisoned.</i>

00:00:18,506 --> 00:00:19,675
Says who?
WINTHROP:
Says me.

00:00:19,675 --> 00:00:22,014
SHAW: <i>Who knew that psychopath</i>
<i>Briscoe had a twin?</i>

00:00:22,014 --> 00:00:24,285
RUSSELL: <i>You think the brothers</i>
<i>were working together.</i>

00:00:24,285 --> 00:00:26,490
I think they still are.

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,625
ECKLIE:
<i>If Briscoe and his brother</i>

00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:28,460
<i>really are the ones</i>

00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,531
behind these murders,
catch them.

00:00:34,774 --> 00:00:35,709
This is Russell.

00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:38,248
I just found
the Gig Harbor Killer.

00:00:38,448 --> 00:00:39,751
Congratulations.

00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:52,211
WOMAN:
<i>CSI Finlay,</i>

00:00:52,211 --> 00:00:54,382
<i>I'm gonna need you</i>
<i>to surrender your firearm.</i>

00:01:01,263 --> 00:01:02,466
Let the record reflect

00:01:02,466 --> 00:01:04,804
that CSI Julie Finlay's
service weapon was received

00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:07,175
with seven live rounds
in the magazine.

00:01:08,612 --> 00:01:10,650
One live round in the chamber.

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,188
It was a good shoot.

00:01:13,188 --> 00:01:14,592
Jared Briscoe
was about

00:01:14,592 --> 00:01:16,128
to kill Lab Director Russell.

00:01:16,128 --> 00:01:17,197
Understood.

00:01:17,197 --> 00:01:18,500
What I don't understand
is what you

00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,802
and the lab director
were doing out there.

00:01:19,802 --> 00:01:22,274
We had a warrant,
based on evidence

00:01:22,274 --> 00:01:24,846
that was recovered outside of
Maya Russell's apartment.

00:01:24,846 --> 00:01:26,483
Lab Director Russell's daughter.

00:01:26,483 --> 00:01:30,224
Evidence that confirmed
Briscoe's stalking of Maya.

00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:31,494
I called Judge Vincent,

00:01:31,494 --> 00:01:33,598
and he issued me a warrant
over the phone.

00:01:33,598 --> 00:01:34,867
Judge Vincent?

00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:36,104
Of course.

00:01:36,104 --> 00:01:37,606
And what is that
supposed to mean?

00:01:37,606 --> 00:01:39,545
I think we both know.

00:01:46,225 --> 00:01:47,360
What the hell, Keri?

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,499
Well, you look like
you were gonna cry.

00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:51,236
You know she doesn't
even know you exist.

00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,507
Not true.
We had coffee last week.

00:01:53,507 --> 00:01:55,111
<i>With</i> Lab Director Russell.

00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:56,547
Baby steps.

00:01:56,547 --> 00:01:57,750
For you or her?

00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,720
Everyone knows she has
the hots for the boss.

00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,390
He's married. Happily.

00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,493
Whatever.

00:02:02,493 --> 00:02:04,263
Take a little advice
from Dr. Torres--

00:02:04,263 --> 00:02:06,268
stay away from that one.

00:02:06,268 --> 00:02:07,704
She's trouble.

00:02:08,272 --> 00:02:09,775
(knocking on the door)

00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:15,320
Hey.
Thanks.

00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,489
Did Eddie call?
No, not yet.

00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:17,825
Hope you didn't bring me
all the way

00:02:17,825 --> 00:02:19,395
up here to Seattle
on a wild-goose chase.

00:02:19,395 --> 00:02:20,698
Don't worry,
Eddie's lead's gonna pan out.

00:02:20,698 --> 00:02:21,734
Trust me.

00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:24,339
Six weeks-- nothing.

00:02:24,339 --> 00:02:26,243
If this guy's gonna drop
Keri's body on us,

00:02:26,243 --> 00:02:27,680
why doesn't
he do it now?

00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,686
Dan, I'm really sorry.

00:02:30,686 --> 00:02:32,323
I know this is really hard.

00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:37,300
If Paul Winthrop wanted
to get his brother free

00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,536
by creating reasonable doubt...

00:02:38,536 --> 00:02:40,507
another body, another
"processed crime scene"--

00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:41,809
that's gonna help
his cause, right?

00:02:41,809 --> 00:02:43,313
Yeah, I think you're right.

00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:45,317
But I do not think that Keri
is gonna be the next body

00:02:45,317 --> 00:02:46,352
that we find.

00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,922
She just does not
fit the profile

00:02:47,922 --> 00:02:49,626
of the Gig Harbor
Killer's victims.

00:02:49,626 --> 00:02:53,367
You know, this guy gets off
on messing with our minds.

00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:55,572
That's why it's
been so quiet.

00:02:55,572 --> 00:02:58,278
It's not gonna be quiet
for long.

00:03:00,817 --> 00:03:01,952
Russell.

00:03:01,952 --> 00:03:03,456
You've got
to hear this.

00:03:03,456 --> 00:03:04,658
MAN: Please, I can't help you
(woman screams)

00:03:04,658 --> 00:03:05,793
if you don't give me
your location.

00:03:05,793 --> 00:03:07,197
What is this?
911 call,

00:03:07,197 --> 00:03:08,867
(woman screams)
came in a few
minutes ago.

00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:10,303
Tracing it now.

00:03:10,303 --> 00:03:12,675
This is how the call
started. Here.

00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:14,579
MAN:
911. What's your emergency?

00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:16,784
SCRAMBLED MALE VOICE:
I'd like to report a murder.

00:03:17,551 --> 00:03:18,688
WOMAN:
Please!

00:03:18,688 --> 00:03:20,425
Stop! Don't!

00:03:20,425 --> 00:03:22,195
No! No...!

00:03:22,195 --> 00:03:25,235
He's killing her right now.
He wants us to hear him do it.

00:03:25,235 --> 00:03:26,370
Talk to me.

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,941
Got a cell tower.
Phone's pinging off it.

00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:31,381
Northtown.

00:03:32,985 --> 00:03:34,655
Pulling data now.

00:03:34,655 --> 00:03:35,824
I got it.

00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:36,826
Phone has GPS.

00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:41,704
(woman screaming)

00:03:48,718 --> 00:03:50,288
(woman screaming)

00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:58,740
(woman crying)

00:04:02,247 --> 00:04:03,783
Miss? Miss, are you still there?

00:04:03,783 --> 00:04:07,457
911 operator,
this is CSI Sara Sidle.

00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:08,527
On scene with officers.

00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:09,562
Code Four.

00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,541
He's back.

00:05:02,774 --> 00:05:05,013
Just like last time,
he took the body with him.

00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,052
But the volume of blood says
that the victim is dead.

00:05:08,052 --> 00:05:09,723
STOKES:
Blood's dry and flaky.

00:05:09,723 --> 00:05:11,627
Murder could have
happened weeks ago.

00:05:11,627 --> 00:05:13,397
So, he returns
to the scene of the crime.

00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,669
He dials 911.
He knew we'd trace it.

00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:17,373
He knew how much time
he'd have to get away.

00:05:17,373 --> 00:05:20,012
That, plus all this,
again tells me we're dealing

00:05:20,012 --> 00:05:21,982
with somebody who knows
police procedure.

00:05:21,982 --> 00:05:24,354
Says to me he's feeling
confident, too.

00:05:24,354 --> 00:05:26,358
Me, too.
We'll catch him.

00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,632
These cameras are
old-school, huh?

00:05:29,632 --> 00:05:30,366
Not digital.

00:05:34,842 --> 00:05:36,046
Exposed film.

00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:37,950
Found the same
in that camera.

00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,385
It's probably in all of them.

00:05:39,385 --> 00:05:41,924
So, what, this guy's
taking crime scene photos

00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,494
for us now, as well?

00:05:43,494 --> 00:05:47,402
It's been a long time since any
of us was in a dark room.

00:05:47,402 --> 00:05:48,639
Yeah.

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,044
SIDLE:
Greek-- Theta Pi.

00:05:51,044 --> 00:05:52,146
Theta Pi?

00:05:52,146 --> 00:05:54,384
College sorority.

00:05:54,384 --> 00:05:56,589
SIDLE: Probably a student
like the others.

00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,862
Good bet she was moonlighting
in the sex trade, too.

00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:05,975
Digital recorder.

00:06:05,975 --> 00:06:07,512
Hit it.

00:06:07,512 --> 00:06:10,652
SCRAMBLED MALE VOICE:
I'm standing at the north wall

00:06:10,652 --> 00:06:14,794
where I'm finding blood
inconsistent with the crime.

00:06:14,794 --> 00:06:16,398
Perhaps stringing
will yield more.

00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:22,744
Strings.

00:06:22,744 --> 00:06:24,013
But no blood.

00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,091
Kill the lights.

00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,145
"People lie.

00:06:39,145 --> 00:06:40,782
Follow the evidence"?

00:06:40,782 --> 00:06:42,553
Hmm.

00:06:42,553 --> 00:06:44,825
We're really
good at that.

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,213
SCRAMBLED MALE VOICE:
Before I register
my preliminary findings,

00:06:55,213 --> 00:06:57,986
I can't help but share
some thoughts on the suspect

00:06:57,986 --> 00:07:00,725
dubbed "The Gig Harbor Killer,"

00:07:00,725 --> 00:07:02,929
<i>but whom I would</i>
<i>more accurately describe</i>

00:07:02,929 --> 00:07:05,101
<i>as "The Crime Scene Killer."</i>

00:07:05,101 --> 00:07:08,675
<i>Clearly our suspect is</i>
<i>intelligent, analytical,</i>

00:07:08,675 --> 00:07:12,250
<i>creative-- an artist whose</i>
<i>medium isn't paint or plaster,</i>

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,924
<i>but flesh and blood.</i>

00:07:15,924 --> 00:07:18,863
Victimology suggests the women
are chosen carefully.

00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:24,175
<i>Young. Blonde. Seemingly</i>
<i>innocent. But far from it.</i>

00:07:24,175 --> 00:07:28,249
<i>With nine victims already,</i>
<i>I see no end in sight.</i>

00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:32,125
<i>No end to the violence</i>
<i>because our killer is a ghost,</i>

00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:35,031
untouchable,
who walks between the raindrops

00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:37,168
and exists in the shadows.

00:07:37,168 --> 00:07:39,574
Not a bad bit
of psychoanalysis.

00:07:39,574 --> 00:07:41,544
Emphasis
on the "psycho."

00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,850
So, his mocking us
has graduated

00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,722
from crime scene
analysis to profiling.

00:07:46,722 --> 00:07:51,633
Can we compare the altered voice
to samples of Paul Winthrop?

00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:54,606
Unfortunately, no.
But I did find something

00:07:54,606 --> 00:07:56,142
on the other recording
that the killer left us.

00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,146
The one he made
of the murder.

00:07:58,146 --> 00:08:01,921
(intermittent screaming)

00:08:01,921 --> 00:08:04,293
Keep listening, I was able
to boost the background.

00:08:04,293 --> 00:08:05,629
(metallic object drops)

00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:07,065
You can hear the killer
drop the weapon,

00:08:07,065 --> 00:08:08,936
begin to walk away.

00:08:08,936 --> 00:08:10,640
(footsteps resounding)

00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,045
And then there's
more footsteps.

00:08:13,045 --> 00:08:14,815
Walking to the recorder
and turning it off.

00:08:14,815 --> 00:08:16,586
Either our "ghost"
can fly...

00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:18,256
Or there were two people
in that room.

00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:20,294
If Winthrop is
the killer,

00:08:20,294 --> 00:08:22,866
he's found a new partner
to sub for his brother.

00:08:22,866 --> 00:08:24,736
Question is-- who?

00:08:24,736 --> 00:08:27,943
(cell phone beeps)

00:08:27,943 --> 00:08:30,950
Oh. Maybe I'll ask him myself.

00:08:32,753 --> 00:08:35,693
I expected treatises
by Locard and Lombroso.

00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:38,599
Dry volumes on criminology.

00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,937
But you're a man of letters.

00:08:44,812 --> 00:08:47,084
<i>The Prince and the Pauper.</i>

00:08:47,084 --> 00:08:48,988
I've always
loved that one.

00:08:48,988 --> 00:08:51,893
What do you want,
Mr. Winthrop?

00:08:51,893 --> 00:08:54,900
The same thing you want--
the truth.

00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,305
Mistakes have
been made.

00:08:57,305 --> 00:09:00,178
The killer
is out there.

00:09:00,178 --> 00:09:01,648
I'm sure you've heard
that my brother, Jared,

00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:03,084
is going to have
a new day in court.

00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,055
I heard.

00:09:05,055 --> 00:09:06,759
Yeah. So, I've enlisted
an expert to conduct

00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,961
a psychological evaluation

00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:10,600
to explain why an innocent man
would confess

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,836
to crimes he didn't commit.

00:09:11,836 --> 00:09:14,876
But that's only part
of the story, isn't it?

00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:17,080
You tell me.

00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,085
You discovered
physical evidence, <i>DNA,</i>

00:09:19,085 --> 00:09:20,889
that exonerates my brother,

00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:24,028
but that unfortunately
also casts

00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:26,267
an unflattering light
on your previous findings.

00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:28,271
I wouldn't go that far.

00:09:28,271 --> 00:09:32,380
I'd like to give you an
opportunity, Mr. Russell.

00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,186
Between you and me, I come here

00:09:35,186 --> 00:09:37,090
requesting
your services

00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,392
as a "friend of the court."

00:09:38,392 --> 00:09:41,164
You want me to help you
and your brother?

00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,303
Help yourself, as well.

00:09:43,303 --> 00:09:45,140
Oh... how's that work?

00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,014
We both know you'll find
more dead women.

00:09:49,014 --> 00:09:50,651
Perhaps you have already?

00:09:50,651 --> 00:09:52,823
Only by freeing
my brother

00:09:52,823 --> 00:09:54,694
will you be able
to free yourself,

00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,831
push away the clouds
of doubt you must feel,

00:09:56,831 --> 00:09:59,070
enabling yourself to

00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,076
have the vision you'll need
to find this predator.

00:10:03,913 --> 00:10:07,187
Well, thank you for the offer,
but I think I'm going to pass.

00:10:07,187 --> 00:10:09,324
Because,

00:10:09,324 --> 00:10:11,128
just between you and me,

00:10:11,128 --> 00:10:13,734
I think you're a sociopath.

00:10:15,104 --> 00:10:17,675
Hmm. I thought we could have
a meeting of the minds,

00:10:17,675 --> 00:10:18,778
but I misjudged you.

00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:23,254
I make a better friend
than enemy.

00:10:30,303 --> 00:10:32,874
SHAW: <i>Eddie. Yeah, listen. Could</i>
<i>you have her come down to PD</i>

00:10:32,874 --> 00:10:33,977
for a conversation?

00:10:33,977 --> 00:10:35,213
Just off the record.

00:10:35,213 --> 00:10:36,415
It's not gonna be easy.

00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,018
I know. I'll owe you one.

00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:39,956
All right.
I'll see what I can do.

00:10:39,956 --> 00:10:41,426
Thank you.

00:10:41,426 --> 00:10:43,196
Told you Eddie
would come through.

00:10:43,196 --> 00:10:44,298
What do you got?

00:10:44,298 --> 00:10:46,904
His gal at the Hall
of Records in Tacoma

00:10:46,904 --> 00:10:48,341
has a birth certificate
for Jared Briscoe.

00:10:48,341 --> 00:10:50,111
Thing is, there's
no record of a twin.

00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:52,349
How's that possible?
I don't know.

00:10:52,349 --> 00:10:54,854
The mother's listed
as Cynthia Hughes, still alive.

00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,358
Eddie's setting up
a meeting right now.

00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,059
Cynthia Hughes?

00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:14,997
That's right.

00:11:14,997 --> 00:11:16,199
You're Jared Briscoe's mother?

00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:18,070
I'm Daniel Shaw.

00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,207
I'm a private investigator.
This is Julie Finlay.

00:11:20,207 --> 00:11:22,313
She's with the Las Vegas
Police Department.

00:11:22,313 --> 00:11:24,283
CYNTHIA: The detective
who brought me here told me.

00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:27,022
But obviously,
he didn't tell you,

00:11:27,022 --> 00:11:30,028
despite what it says
on the birth certificate,

00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:31,967
I'm not Jared's birth mother.

00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,770
He neglected to tell us that.

00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:37,545
After I adopted Jared,
I petitioned the court,

00:11:37,545 --> 00:11:39,382
I needed a birth
certificate.

00:11:39,382 --> 00:11:42,221
They put my
name on it.

00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:45,060
So, you don't know
who Jared's birth mother is?

00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,397
No.

00:11:46,397 --> 00:11:50,105
But I know I have to
live with the fact

00:11:50,105 --> 00:11:53,077
that I'm responsible
for what's become of him.

00:11:53,077 --> 00:11:54,180
"Responsible."

00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,416
Why do you say that?

00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,890
My husband and I didn't have
the best marriage.

00:12:00,092 --> 00:12:02,030
He'd fly into rages.

00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,268
And poor Jared...

00:12:04,268 --> 00:12:06,539
he paid the price.

00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:09,278
Is that why Jared went
into foster care?

00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,552
I tried to get him back
many times.

00:12:12,552 --> 00:12:14,156
Miss Hughes,
we haven't found any records

00:12:14,156 --> 00:12:15,358
of adoption for Jared.

00:12:15,358 --> 00:12:17,262
And you won't find any.

00:12:18,465 --> 00:12:22,974
Jared was dropped at my doorstep
by a friend.

00:12:22,974 --> 00:12:24,444
She worked at a convent,

00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:28,419
a place where girls
in trouble often went.

00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:30,958
So, you're saying
that Jared's mother was one

00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,327
of these "girls in trouble"?

00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:33,931
Yes.

00:12:33,931 --> 00:12:36,470
Do you know that
Jared has a brother?

00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,940
A twin.

00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,977
No.

00:12:39,977 --> 00:12:41,179
I did not.

00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:43,318
This convent,
is it still around?

00:12:43,318 --> 00:12:45,255
Do you remember
the name?

00:12:45,255 --> 00:12:47,159
St. Gabriella's.

00:12:56,946 --> 00:12:59,352
Nick was right.

00:12:59,352 --> 00:13:03,260
The killer has added taking
crime scene photos to his M.O.

00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,901
DNA from the blood at the crime
scene didn't pop on CODIS.

00:13:06,901 --> 00:13:08,271
But now that we have a face,

00:13:08,271 --> 00:13:11,978
maybe it can help us get a name
from another database.

00:13:11,978 --> 00:13:14,049
You got anything?

00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:17,290
Well, the first images on some
of the rolls all look the same.

00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,396
<i>As if the killer,</i>
<i>when loading the camera,</i>

00:13:20,396 --> 00:13:22,166
<i>advanced the film</i>

00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:26,042
<i>and accidentally popped off</i>
<i>a few exposures at the head.</i>

00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:27,611
And they're blurry,

00:13:27,611 --> 00:13:30,283
but doesn't this look like
an "H" to you?

00:13:30,283 --> 00:13:33,991
Yeah, maybe from a sign,
or a billboard.

00:13:33,991 --> 00:13:36,063
Uh, there were no signs
or billboards anywhere

00:13:36,063 --> 00:13:37,498
near the crime scene.

00:13:37,498 --> 00:13:39,670
I think I know a way
to enhance these.

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,574
If we can figure out
where this is,

00:13:41,574 --> 00:13:45,148
then this could help us find
where the killer is.

00:13:50,058 --> 00:13:51,695
FINLAY:
St. Gabriella's Convent.

00:13:51,695 --> 00:13:54,268
Wow. To be honest, I didn't know
places like this still existed.

00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:56,138
SHAW: Nun I talked to
on the phone said

00:13:56,138 --> 00:13:57,575
she might be able to help us.

00:13:57,575 --> 00:13:59,579
FINLAY:
Well, let's hope so.

00:14:00,648 --> 00:14:02,151
Sister Alice?

00:14:02,151 --> 00:14:03,955
Mr. Shaw. Miss Finlay.

00:14:03,955 --> 00:14:04,990
Any luck?

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,494
Unfortunately,
my predecessors here

00:14:06,494 --> 00:14:07,529
didn't believe in computers,

00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:09,033
but I found this.

00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:12,039
It's a ledger listing births
to young mothers

00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,274
during the years our convent

00:14:13,274 --> 00:14:14,411
took in girls in need.

00:14:14,411 --> 00:14:16,048
I found the entry
you're looking for.

00:14:16,048 --> 00:14:19,421
June 18, 1976.

00:14:19,421 --> 00:14:21,492
Twin boys born.

00:14:21,492 --> 00:14:23,062
Given names "Jared" and "Paul."

00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,365
Mother is listed

00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:25,667
as "Nancy Harper."

00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,440
Any indication
of adoption?

00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,443
Uh... no.

00:14:29,443 --> 00:14:30,478
Nothing.

00:14:30,478 --> 00:14:31,947
It was before my time,

00:14:31,947 --> 00:14:34,619
but I understand it wasn't
uncommon for babies born

00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:36,123
in that sort of circumstance

00:14:36,123 --> 00:14:40,099
to be given informally
to families deemed worthy.

00:14:40,099 --> 00:14:41,701
Well, we know where
Jared ended up.

00:14:41,701 --> 00:14:44,073
What about Paul?

00:14:44,073 --> 00:14:46,077
I can answer that.

00:14:49,351 --> 00:14:51,322
There was a fire some years ago.

00:14:51,322 --> 00:14:52,725
Records were lost.

00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,433
But a certain Sister Bernadette
made notations from memory.

00:14:56,433 --> 00:15:00,274
There was a "C-13"
noted in the ledger

00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:04,984
speaking to the fate
of a "baby Paul."

00:15:04,984 --> 00:15:07,156
The child never left us.

00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,594
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

00:15:09,594 --> 00:15:11,264
This is a cemetery.

00:15:11,264 --> 00:15:13,102
Yes, for infants
that died

00:15:13,102 --> 00:15:15,139
during childbirth
or shortly thereafter.

00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:17,778
If you're searching for
this "Paul Winthrop,"

00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:20,016
your search ends here.

00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,442
FINLAY:
D.B., I got a court order
to exhume the grave.

00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:33,779
Didn't make Sister Alice

00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:35,114
very happy.

00:15:35,114 --> 00:15:36,685
Well, she'll survive.

00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,522
Just like Paul Winthrop did.

00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:40,292
Which begs the question--

00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:41,696
who's buried in Grant's Tomb?

00:15:41,696 --> 00:15:44,502
Yeah. I'm working on that,
but, uh, there's something else.

00:15:44,502 --> 00:15:46,806
You know how Winthrop claims
that he didn't have a brother

00:15:46,806 --> 00:15:48,510
until he found out
about him on the news?

00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,247
Right. So, what,
you got something?

00:15:50,247 --> 00:15:53,220
Well, there was a fire here, and
all the records were destroyed.

00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,758
But this one nun tried
to reconstruct them from memory,

00:15:55,758 --> 00:15:57,696
and made a note
in the visitors log.

00:15:57,696 --> 00:16:00,268
Turns out that we are not
the first people

00:16:00,268 --> 00:16:02,506
to come around here asking
about Jared and his brother.

00:16:02,506 --> 00:16:04,210
Was there a name?

00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,445
No, but...

00:16:05,445 --> 00:16:07,817
the visitor was from San Diego.

00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:11,358
That's Paul Winthrop's hometown.
When was this?

00:16:11,358 --> 00:16:14,531
One year before
the Gig Harbor murders began.

00:16:14,531 --> 00:16:16,570
Let me know what you find
in that grave, will you?

00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,574
I'll have an answer soon.

00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,287
Interesting.

00:16:25,287 --> 00:16:26,791
You isolated the
different colors.

00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,828
I don't know how much good
it's doing me, though.

00:16:28,828 --> 00:16:32,503
Well, first message was
in the green strings, right?

00:16:32,503 --> 00:16:36,311
"Gemini," the twins' way
of announcing themselves,

00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:37,780
daring us to catch them.

00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,520
STOKES: Didn't find
any Gemini this time.

00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,889
You're looking for
other constellations.

00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:43,226
Yeah.

00:16:43,226 --> 00:16:45,197
I've been spinning
these webs for hours,

00:16:45,197 --> 00:16:47,101
just coming up empty.

00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:49,606
Maybe the answer's not
in the strings.

00:16:54,784 --> 00:16:57,355
"People lie.
Follow the evidence."

00:16:57,355 --> 00:16:58,825
What are you thinking?

00:16:58,825 --> 00:17:01,331
What's different
about this crime scene?

00:17:01,331 --> 00:17:03,770
For starters, the cameras.

00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,774
Yeah.

00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,715
Last time, the message was
in the bird's-eye view

00:17:09,715 --> 00:17:11,185
of the crime scene.

00:17:14,258 --> 00:17:15,861
All these cameras.

00:17:15,861 --> 00:17:17,832
How about...
we connect the dots.

00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,217
Here's the
constellation.

00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:27,319
Right?

00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,823
It's Virgo.

00:17:28,823 --> 00:17:31,260
The virgin.

00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,232
The killer said that
the women were chosen

00:17:33,232 --> 00:17:35,303
because they were
"seemingly innocent," virginal.

00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,211
But they were all
in the sex trade, too.

00:17:39,211 --> 00:17:41,850
So, this wasn't
about the killer or killers;

00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,687
it was about the victims.

00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,190
Madonna-whore complex.

00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,631
First, Winthrop tells us
who's doing the killings,

00:17:48,631 --> 00:17:49,533
then he tells us why.

00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:53,441
Mommy issues.

00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:09,408
♪ ♪

00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:33,292
It's a doll.

00:18:37,735 --> 00:18:39,439
Head's really loose.

00:18:40,608 --> 00:18:42,511
There's something inside.

00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,397
She looks like a teenager.

00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:52,734
I'm guessing
we're looking

00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:54,638
at Jared and Paul's
birth mother.

00:18:59,782 --> 00:19:01,619
Well, look at this.

00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:05,929
Think this could
possibly be

00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:07,431
the hair of the mother?

00:19:07,431 --> 00:19:09,703
Maybe DNA will confirm.

00:19:09,703 --> 00:19:11,807
Yeah, but it still won't
tell us why somebody went

00:19:11,807 --> 00:19:13,411
through this whole charade.

00:19:13,411 --> 00:19:15,315
I-I get why Jared
was given up for adoption.

00:19:15,315 --> 00:19:17,485
But why pretend
his twin brother died?

00:19:17,485 --> 00:19:19,324
Maybe that's the same
question Winthrop was asking

00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,726
when he came here
looking for his brother.

00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,663
Looking for a partner in crime.

00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,439
WOMAN:
<i>Let's talk about your brother.</i>

00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:29,077
When did you first know
of his existence?

00:19:29,077 --> 00:19:31,950
Physically, astrologically

00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,319
or... otherwise?

00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,589
WOMAN:
You choose.

00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:37,962
Two little mutants,
clinging to each other

00:19:37,962 --> 00:19:41,370
in a sack of blood
and urine and excrement.

00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,042
There's an obvious bond there.

00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:47,549
Until they reach in
and-and tear them apart.

00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:49,587
WOMAN: You're talking
about your separation.

00:19:49,587 --> 00:19:50,690
JARED:
Yeah.

00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,794
They ripped me away
from my brother,

00:19:52,794 --> 00:19:54,931
took me away from
the only mother I ever knew,

00:19:54,931 --> 00:19:58,472
the only woman who ever...

00:19:58,472 --> 00:19:59,642
wanted me.

00:19:59,642 --> 00:20:01,813
WOMAN:
You mean your adoptive mother.

00:20:01,813 --> 00:20:03,083
You know what it's like
to be handed

00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,385
from foster family
to foster family.

00:20:04,385 --> 00:20:05,421
They just want the check,
that's all.

00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:07,492
I mean, come on.
How can they expect me

00:20:07,492 --> 00:20:10,465
to be anything other than
a serial killer?

00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:12,002
WOMAN: Is that
what you really think?

00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,808
Is that why you confessed
to all these crimes?

00:20:14,808 --> 00:20:16,812
I don't want to talk anymore.

00:20:16,812 --> 00:20:19,918
I'm gonna ask you
one more time, Jared.

00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:24,862
Do you really believe that
you are the Gig Harbor Killer?

00:20:24,862 --> 00:20:27,868
If I'm not, then who am I?

00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:32,645
Who am I?

00:20:32,645 --> 00:20:34,716
Turn the camera off.

00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:36,854
Turn it off!

00:20:38,624 --> 00:20:41,397
Whatever Winthrop's paying that
psychiatrist, it's not enough.

00:20:41,397 --> 00:20:45,038
Well, it is if this
performance convinces a court

00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:46,574
that Briscoe's
mentally ill.

00:20:46,574 --> 00:20:48,679
I'm not so sure
it is a performance.

00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:52,154
Abandoned and abused
in the foster care system,

00:20:52,154 --> 00:20:54,057
it would make him vulnerable
to a stronger will,

00:20:54,057 --> 00:20:57,097
especially if that will was
a reflection of himself.

00:20:57,097 --> 00:20:59,669
Dominant twin manipulates
the weaker,

00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:02,041
uses him to commit his crimes.

00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,678
Let's him take the fall.

00:21:03,678 --> 00:21:07,819
Then why does Winthrop
save Briscoe from death row?

00:21:07,819 --> 00:21:12,529
Without the reflection,
the narcissist dies, too.

00:21:14,568 --> 00:21:16,772
BRODY:
Hey, Henry.

00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:18,776
Heard Hodges found human tissue
in the strings again.

00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:19,979
He told me
you found DNA.

00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:21,516
Two contributors.

00:21:21,516 --> 00:21:23,787
Both female. One was a match
to the blood at the crime scene.

00:21:23,787 --> 00:21:25,992
Our victim,
who now has a name--

00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:28,530
Pamela Kramer.

00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,969
Ran facial recognition
against the college database.

00:21:30,969 --> 00:21:32,839
She was a
student at WLVU.

00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:34,543
Notified next of kin.
They're sending over

00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,645
DNA exemplars to confirm.

00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:36,748
Good.

00:21:36,748 --> 00:21:38,852
Unfortunately,
I won't need exemplars

00:21:38,852 --> 00:21:40,656
to identify the second
female contributor.

00:21:40,656 --> 00:21:42,660
What do you mean?

00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,197
I found a match in CODIS.

00:21:44,197 --> 00:21:46,836
(cell phone buzzes)
It's Keri Torres.

00:21:46,836 --> 00:21:50,176
I guess, given everything, her
fate should come as no surprise,

00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:51,880
but still...

00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,986
Are you sure
about that second DNA?

00:21:54,986 --> 00:21:56,957
Yeah. I mean,
I ran it twice. Why?

00:21:56,957 --> 00:21:59,930
'Cause Keri Torres was just
brought into Desert Palm.

00:22:04,005 --> 00:22:05,542
RUSSELL:
Where was she found?

00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:08,481
At the intersection of
Jefferson and Sahara.

00:22:08,481 --> 00:22:09,818
She was staggering
through the cars.

00:22:09,818 --> 00:22:11,755
Police said she was
combative, incoherent.

00:22:11,755 --> 00:22:13,759
They thought she was
a meth-head until
they ran her.

00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:15,763
Looks like she's
been through hell.

00:22:15,763 --> 00:22:17,935
She's got ligature marks
on her wrists and her ankles.

00:22:17,935 --> 00:22:19,872
An incision mark
on her abdomen,

00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,008
where he opened
her up...

00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:23,113
He didn't let her go.

00:22:23,113 --> 00:22:24,983
He was still
playing with her.

00:22:24,983 --> 00:22:26,754
But she got away.

00:22:26,754 --> 00:22:28,123
Nah, she fought her way free.

00:22:28,123 --> 00:22:30,160
BRODY:
He underestimated her.

00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,964
He finally made a mistake.

00:22:31,964 --> 00:22:33,501
Yeah.

00:22:39,147 --> 00:22:40,951
Keri's going to make it.

00:22:40,951 --> 00:22:42,921
Tox report says she was drugged.

00:22:42,921 --> 00:22:45,192
Combination of opiates
and hallucinogens.

00:22:45,192 --> 00:22:46,629
So there were
signs of torture?

00:22:46,629 --> 00:22:47,664
RUSSELL:
Yeah.

00:22:47,664 --> 00:22:48,666
Including taking a piece of her

00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:49,668
to make more of his strings.

00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:50,637
SHAW:
I don't get it.

00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:53,042
Why didn't he
just kill her?

00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:54,679
I'm sure Winthrop
was probably trying

00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:55,915
to get information
out of her.

00:22:55,915 --> 00:22:58,053
We know she was close
to learning the truth.

00:22:58,053 --> 00:22:59,189
Did you get DNA results

00:22:59,189 --> 00:23:00,993
on the hair you found
in the coffin?

00:23:00,993 --> 00:23:02,095
Yeah. It was
a definite match

00:23:02,095 --> 00:23:04,867
to Briscoe and Winthrop's
birth mother.

00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:07,808
D.B., Winthrop was
definitely at that convent.

00:23:07,808 --> 00:23:09,545
He was there searching
for his brother.

00:23:09,545 --> 00:23:11,549
We can't prove that,
though, right?
FINLAY: Oh, we will.

00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:13,186
We're gonna catch
the first flight back.

00:23:13,186 --> 00:23:14,823
We're on our way to
the airport right now.

00:23:14,823 --> 00:23:15,825
All right, fly safe.

00:23:15,825 --> 00:23:18,095
I can't believe
she's still alive.

00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,603
Can't imagine what
she went through.

Yeah, you did.

00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:40,003
But right now,
I need your help.

00:24:40,003 --> 00:24:41,873
Do you remember
anything?

00:24:44,078 --> 00:24:45,080
No, I can't...

00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:48,086
I just...

00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:50,224
I just remember... a room.

(grunts)

00:24:52,796 --> 00:24:54,266
<i>There were strings.</i>

00:24:54,266 --> 00:24:55,803
Everywhere.

00:24:55,803 --> 00:24:57,005
Strings?

00:24:57,005 --> 00:24:59,076
You mean like trajectory
strings from a crime scene?

00:24:59,076 --> 00:25:01,949
No, um...

00:25:01,949 --> 00:25:03,185
they were just hanging there.

00:25:05,056 --> 00:25:07,661
<i>Like fishing line</i>
<i>hung out to dry.</i>

00:25:07,661 --> 00:25:09,865
How did you get away?

00:25:09,865 --> 00:25:12,672
For days,

00:25:12,672 --> 00:25:14,175
I thought there was water

00:25:14,175 --> 00:25:16,246
<i>all around me.</i>

00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:21,156
<i>It was blue.</i>

00:25:21,156 --> 00:25:22,693
<i>Like the ocean.</i>

00:25:22,693 --> 00:25:24,797
And then I realized

00:25:24,797 --> 00:25:26,067
it wasn't water.

00:25:27,703 --> 00:25:29,073
It was glass.

00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,916
<i>I was able to cut my way out.</i>

00:25:35,855 --> 00:25:38,092
I found a vent.

00:25:38,092 --> 00:25:40,731
I saw light...

00:25:40,731 --> 00:25:42,068
daylight.

00:25:43,103 --> 00:25:44,439
And I just kept
crawling forward,

00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:45,842
toward the light.

00:25:45,842 --> 00:25:47,880
I didn't care where it led--
Heaven, hell...

00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,483
I didn't care,
I just kept going.

00:25:49,483 --> 00:25:51,454
I just kept going... (sobs)

00:25:53,324 --> 00:25:55,328
I...

00:25:55,328 --> 00:25:56,799
I can't remember
much more than that.

00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:57,801
No, that's good.

00:25:57,801 --> 00:25:59,137
You're-you're
doing really good.

00:26:00,974 --> 00:26:02,343
I have just
one more question.

00:26:03,847 --> 00:26:06,519
Before you were taken,
you met with a man.

00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:08,123
At a coffee house.

00:26:08,123 --> 00:26:09,525
Yeah, I remember.

00:26:09,525 --> 00:26:12,131
His name
was, um...

00:26:12,131 --> 00:26:14,068
Turner.

00:26:14,068 --> 00:26:15,205
Mark Turner.

00:26:15,205 --> 00:26:17,209
He was a lawyer.

00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:18,377
This is a picture of him.

00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:19,379
Do you recognize him?

00:26:19,379 --> 00:26:21,251
No.

00:26:23,522 --> 00:26:25,459
I mean, no,
that's not the man I met.

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,470
What about this man?

00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,811
Yes. That's him.

00:26:36,783 --> 00:26:38,787
(people talking, laughing)

00:26:45,134 --> 00:26:46,169
Little young for you,

00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:47,339
don't you think?

00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:48,408
I don't think so.

00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:50,045
But then again,
I don't have a daughter.

00:26:50,045 --> 00:26:52,049
I hear that makes a difference.

00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:53,386
You here because

00:26:53,386 --> 00:26:55,323
you changed your mind
about helping my brother?

00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:56,927
Or you need a lift?

00:26:56,927 --> 00:26:58,162
You two meet
online?

00:26:58,162 --> 00:26:59,564
That's none of
your business.
Young lady,

00:26:59,564 --> 00:27:02,905
there's a taxicab
right over there.

00:27:02,905 --> 00:27:04,041
I suggest
you go home.

00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:06,479
Your client and I have
a few things to discuss.

00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:08,116
Thank you for
dinner tonight.

00:27:08,116 --> 00:27:10,488
I'll call.
Yeah, a little
heads-up there.

00:27:10,488 --> 00:27:12,359
This guy's
a murderer.

00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:15,031
So if he calls,
hang up.

00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,037
That was subtle.

00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:19,307
You lied to us.

00:27:19,307 --> 00:27:20,509
It wasn't your
lawyer that met

00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:22,547
Keri Torres at
the coffee shop.

00:27:22,547 --> 00:27:24,351
It was you.

00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,023
And that was right
before she disappeared.

00:27:27,023 --> 00:27:28,293
I didn't lie.

00:27:28,293 --> 00:27:30,364
Your people just never
asked me the question.

00:27:30,364 --> 00:27:32,902
This is one big game
for you, isn't it?

00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:35,240
You think you're
smarter than we are.

00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,844
All those
crime scenes,

00:27:36,844 --> 00:27:39,116
leaving your brother's
fingerprint under the table...

00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:40,853
You don't see what's
going on here, do you?

00:27:40,853 --> 00:27:42,088
Or maybe you
don't want to.

00:27:42,088 --> 00:27:43,992
What's that
supposed to mean?

00:27:43,992 --> 00:27:45,262
I confess.

00:27:45,262 --> 00:27:48,201
Yes, I met with
Keri Torres.

00:27:48,201 --> 00:27:49,638
Because she reached
out to my attorney

00:27:49,638 --> 00:27:51,842
with evidence that
my brother was innocent.

00:27:51,842 --> 00:27:54,248
Framed by someone
in Seattle PD.

00:27:54,248 --> 00:27:55,951
Oh, is that
right?
That's right.

00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:57,087
She was going to provide

00:27:57,087 --> 00:27:58,924
even more information
the next meeting.

00:27:58,924 --> 00:28:00,193
But she never
showed up.

00:28:00,193 --> 00:28:01,630
So forgive me
if I chose

00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,233
to be less than forthcoming,

00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:05,872
especially when the person
who was asking me the questions

00:28:05,872 --> 00:28:08,110
was the cop who
shot my brother.

00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:11,384
I think you'd better leave
CSI Finlay out of this.

00:28:11,384 --> 00:28:12,519
Kind of hard to.

00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:14,991
I think you and I are
on the same side here.

00:28:14,991 --> 00:28:16,895
You just don't know it yet.

00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,232
Oh.

00:28:18,232 --> 00:28:20,236
See, I almost
forgot to tell you.

00:28:20,236 --> 00:28:21,238
We found your grave.

00:28:22,307 --> 00:28:24,111
Nancy Harper, right?

00:28:24,111 --> 00:28:25,247
That's your
birth mother?

00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:26,649
Interesting.

00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:28,420
You know what else
is interesting?

00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,560
We have Keri Torres.

00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,297
And she's alive.

00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:36,070
That's great news.

00:28:36,337 --> 00:28:38,141
I look forward
to seeing her.

00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:47,928
FINLAY:
Hey.

00:28:47,928 --> 00:28:49,230
Hey, welcome back.

00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,333
Morgan said
you're working on

00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:51,502
finding the killer's
location?

00:28:51,502 --> 00:28:52,939
Yeah. And we got lucky.

00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:57,214
He took photos of what
I think is the same landmark,

00:28:57,214 --> 00:28:59,920
using different cameras
at different exposures.

00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,423
How does that help?

00:29:01,423 --> 00:29:03,027
Well, each photo
has detail

00:29:03,027 --> 00:29:04,931
in the light
and dark areas

00:29:04,931 --> 00:29:06,166
unique to that photo.
Mm-hmm.

00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:09,607
So using high-dynamic-range
software, I can overlap them

00:29:09,607 --> 00:29:11,946
to create a more
vivid composite.

00:29:11,946 --> 00:29:13,983
Whole's greater than
the sum of its parts.

00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:17,624
Hmm.

00:29:17,624 --> 00:29:20,564
You know, before, I thought

00:29:20,564 --> 00:29:22,435
this here was an "H."

00:29:22,435 --> 00:29:23,202
Like on a sign.

00:29:23,202 --> 00:29:25,107
But now...
it looks like

00:29:25,107 --> 00:29:26,176
some kind of
structure.

00:29:26,176 --> 00:29:27,345
Yeah.

00:29:27,345 --> 00:29:29,249
I feel like
I've seen this place before.

00:29:29,249 --> 00:29:31,487
So, I ran the glass

00:29:31,487 --> 00:29:33,725
Morgan pulled
from Keri Torres's foot.

00:29:33,725 --> 00:29:35,061
Refractive light index

00:29:35,061 --> 00:29:36,632
found the usual

00:29:36,632 --> 00:29:37,967
silicon dioxide

00:29:37,967 --> 00:29:39,236
mixed with potassium
and zinc oxide.

00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:42,243
But there was an element
that did stand out.

00:29:42,243 --> 00:29:43,312
What's that?

00:29:43,312 --> 00:29:46,318
Tin oxide with
hamachi indigo dye.

00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:47,988
It's found in

00:29:47,988 --> 00:29:50,227
Japanese Blue Bark
textured glass,

00:29:50,227 --> 00:29:53,099
which is used in
making tiles, statuary

00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:54,536
and objets d'art.

00:29:54,536 --> 00:29:55,738
Which I am familiar with

00:29:55,738 --> 00:29:57,208
because my mother's a collector.

00:29:57,208 --> 00:29:59,479
In fact, funny story...
Hodges...

00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:01,150
Hodges, you're a genius.
I am?

00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,553
I got it.
I figured out what that is.

00:30:02,553 --> 00:30:05,492
It's the gate that
you walked through

00:30:05,492 --> 00:30:07,396
to enter The Mizu Hotel.

00:30:07,396 --> 00:30:09,300
Built in '62.

00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,004
Went belly up
in the '70s.

00:30:11,004 --> 00:30:13,141
Developers tried to
renovate it but quit.

00:30:13,141 --> 00:30:15,280
But the place was known for

00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,785
its blue glass ceiling
and wall tiles.

00:30:17,785 --> 00:30:20,391
They were meant
to resemble the ocean.

00:30:20,391 --> 00:30:22,195
Which I would assume
came pouring down

00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,464
during the aborted renovations.

00:30:23,464 --> 00:30:25,501
The reason why this
place was abandoned

00:30:25,501 --> 00:30:28,040
was because of
its lousy location.

00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,710
The Alphabets.

00:30:50,187 --> 00:30:52,191
♪ ♪

00:31:19,483 --> 00:31:20,318
Strings.

00:31:22,355 --> 00:31:24,727
Now we know how he makes them.

00:31:29,437 --> 00:31:30,506
These, too.

00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:35,182
Looks like we
found his workshop.

00:31:36,252 --> 00:31:37,387
Now, where is he?

00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:46,773
(sirens approaching)

00:32:06,281 --> 00:32:07,818
(thumping sound)

00:32:23,518 --> 00:32:25,154
No! (screams)

00:32:25,154 --> 00:32:27,360
(screaming, whimpering)

00:32:28,695 --> 00:32:30,567
It's okay.
We're the police.

00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:31,936
We're here to help you.
The girls...

00:32:31,936 --> 00:32:34,375
the girls...
What girls?

00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:36,445
There's others.
He has them.

00:32:36,445 --> 00:32:38,449
Where?
The room...
the room

00:32:38,449 --> 00:32:39,719
where he does
things to them,

00:32:39,719 --> 00:32:40,855
to us...
Where?

00:32:40,855 --> 00:32:42,325
I... I...

00:32:42,325 --> 00:32:43,460
Where is the room?

00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,331
Uh... there.
I'm gonna
go find them.

00:32:45,331 --> 00:32:46,868
All right, I'm gonna
stay here with her.

00:32:46,868 --> 00:32:49,306
Uh, Dispatch, this is
Charlie-0-5-Sanders.

00:32:49,306 --> 00:32:50,709
I need immediate
medical to my location.

00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:52,780
Are you really
the police?
Yes.

00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,383
And don't worry,
I'm not going to leave you.

00:32:54,383 --> 00:32:55,820
Okay?
Oh...

00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,322
I'm so cold.

00:32:57,322 --> 00:32:58,559
(shuddering)

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,329
Please.

00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:02,868
Okay, just let me
find something.

00:33:02,868 --> 00:33:04,337
Uh...

00:33:04,337 --> 00:33:05,474
All right, uh, here.

00:33:05,474 --> 00:33:07,478
Just take this...
(yelling)

00:33:11,754 --> 00:33:14,560
(groaning)

00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,265
(panting)

00:33:19,369 --> 00:33:21,373
Don't!
No, please.

00:33:21,373 --> 00:33:23,245
You don't understand.

00:33:23,245 --> 00:33:24,614
I'm here to save you.

00:33:24,614 --> 00:33:26,485
No, you're not!
FINLAY: Yes, he is.

00:33:26,485 --> 00:33:27,721
We both are.

00:33:27,721 --> 00:33:29,290
Then why are you
pointing a gun at me?

00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,827
Why don't we both
put our guns down?

00:33:30,827 --> 00:33:32,998
And we can talk about how
we're gonna get you out of here.

00:33:32,998 --> 00:33:34,635
MITCHELL:
Charlie-0-5-Sanders, respond.

00:33:34,635 --> 00:33:36,372
It's just my police radio.

00:33:36,372 --> 00:33:38,511
When it fell on its side,
it sent out an alert.

00:33:38,511 --> 00:33:39,780
You're lying.
You're trying to trick me.

00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,383
No, he's not.
We're here to help you.

00:33:41,383 --> 00:33:43,521
Charlie-0-5-Sanders, respond.
You have to let me answer that.

00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,491
Because if you don't
and they come in here

00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:47,262
and see you pointing a gun...

00:33:47,262 --> 00:33:49,032
They're gonna kill me!
I won't let that happen.

00:33:49,032 --> 00:33:51,638
But you need to let me
answer that now.

00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:53,643
Charlie-0-5-Sanders, talk to me!
Charlie-0-5-Sanders!

00:33:53,643 --> 00:33:54,645
Are you there?

00:33:54,645 --> 00:33:55,747
No!

00:33:55,747 --> 00:33:57,384
No!

00:33:57,384 --> 00:33:58,586
Stop!

00:33:58,586 --> 00:34:00,256
(gunshots)

00:34:07,906 --> 00:34:10,946
MAN:
<i>CSI Finlay, I need you</i>
<i>to surrender your firearm.</i>

00:34:15,522 --> 00:34:16,390
I know the drill.

00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:18,394
Yes, you do.

00:34:23,806 --> 00:34:25,978
Note: I've received

00:34:25,978 --> 00:34:29,318
CSI Finlay's SIG Sauer P-232.

00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:30,854
Four live rounds
in the magazine.

00:34:30,854 --> 00:34:34,428
One live round
in the chamber.

00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:39,806
So...

00:34:39,806 --> 00:34:41,978
why don't you just start
from the beginning?

00:34:41,978 --> 00:34:44,417
I've been in that room before.

00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:45,452
We both have.

00:34:45,452 --> 00:34:47,390
Any I.D. on that woman yet?
No.

00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,327
All we know is that it looks

00:34:49,327 --> 00:34:51,532
like she was being
held like Keri.

00:34:51,532 --> 00:34:52,801
From what I heard,

00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:54,972
Finlay did what
she had to do.

00:34:54,972 --> 00:34:56,542
Yeah.

00:34:56,542 --> 00:34:58,613
She always does.

00:35:00,818 --> 00:35:02,755
(door opens)

00:35:10,572 --> 00:35:12,710
Hey.

00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,582
You okay?

00:35:15,582 --> 00:35:17,887
I was trying to help her.

00:35:17,887 --> 00:35:21,829
And I keep thinking to myself

00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:24,134
maybe I could've said
something different.

00:35:24,134 --> 00:35:26,673
Or maybe I could've
done a better job

00:35:26,673 --> 00:35:29,379
of making her feel safe.

00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:30,647
Greg, it wasn't your fault.

00:35:30,647 --> 00:35:32,619
I mean, she was
probably drugged.

00:35:32,619 --> 00:35:34,890
God knows what else
was done to her.

00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:37,029
When the police found Keri
Torres, she was delusional,

00:35:37,029 --> 00:35:38,364
she was aggressive.
I know.

00:35:38,364 --> 00:35:40,636
I know.

00:35:40,636 --> 00:35:43,609
But we were there.

00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:45,679
And I could've saved her.

00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,426
And now she's dead.

00:35:51,426 --> 00:35:53,763
How am I supposed
to live with that?

00:35:53,763 --> 00:35:55,667
You did the best you could.

00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:56,804
You need to know that.

00:35:56,804 --> 00:35:59,509
In time, you
will know that.

00:35:59,509 --> 00:36:01,980
As far as how you live
with what happened...

00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,519
I wish I knew the
answer to that.

00:36:10,899 --> 00:36:12,503
PHILLIPS:
I could not imagine

00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,873
what Greg and Finn
are going through.

00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:18,749
I.A.'s put a rush
on this evidence.

00:36:18,749 --> 00:36:21,455
Let's just hope they
don't rush to judgment.

00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,163
You sent her DNA to Henry yet?

00:36:25,163 --> 00:36:26,766
Yeah. Why?

00:36:26,766 --> 00:36:30,207
There's scar tissue
in her pelvic area.

00:36:30,207 --> 00:36:31,878
Our victim's undergone surgery.

00:36:31,878 --> 00:36:33,180
It's not surprising.

00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,719
The killer performed surgery
on all of his victims.

00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:37,724
Harvesting their tissue
for his strings.

00:36:37,724 --> 00:36:39,995
That's not what this is.

00:36:39,995 --> 00:36:42,467
What do you mean?
Take a look for yourself.

00:36:44,604 --> 00:36:47,076
Colovaginoplasty.

00:36:47,076 --> 00:36:49,482
Our she was once a he.

00:36:59,603 --> 00:37:01,775
Look, I know you
wanted to see me.

00:37:01,775 --> 00:37:03,612
So, let me guess.

00:37:03,612 --> 00:37:05,181
Two-week suspension with pay,

00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,987
pending the outcome of
the I.A. investigation.

00:37:07,987 --> 00:37:10,760
No, you're not gonna
be suspended, Jules.

00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,131
Matter of fact, you're
probably gonna get a medal.

00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:14,568
What?

00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:17,641
Well, apparently you just
took down the Gig Harbor Killer.

00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:19,746
The unknown male DNA

00:37:19,746 --> 00:37:20,948
that we recovered
from the bodies

00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:22,652
in the desert--
you remember that?

00:37:24,889 --> 00:37:26,828
Well, that DNA's a match

00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,898
to the woman you just shot.

00:37:28,898 --> 00:37:30,636
I do not understand.

00:37:30,636 --> 00:37:32,906
We still don't know who she is,

00:37:32,906 --> 00:37:34,644
but apparently
Doc said that she had

00:37:34,644 --> 00:37:36,849
a gender reassignment surgery.

00:37:36,849 --> 00:37:39,888
Possibly as long
as a decade ago.

00:37:39,888 --> 00:37:42,193
DNA's still XY.
No.

00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,866
She's got to be another
part of Winthrop's game.

00:37:44,866 --> 00:37:46,001
The unknown

00:37:46,001 --> 00:37:48,940
male DNA was planted
on those bodies.

00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,277
That woman

00:37:50,277 --> 00:37:52,515
that I shot is
just another victim.

00:37:52,515 --> 00:37:54,720
She was kidnapped,
she was used

00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,190
by Winthrop,
she was drugged

00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,194
and reduced to a paranoid state.

00:37:58,194 --> 00:37:59,764
Just like Keri Torres.

00:37:59,764 --> 00:38:00,933
Yeah, and like Keri,

00:38:00,933 --> 00:38:02,603
he knew how she'd react

00:38:02,603 --> 00:38:04,240
the minute we barged
into that room.

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,078
And he is probably
getting off right now

00:38:06,078 --> 00:38:08,649
on the idea that I killed
an innocent woman.

00:38:10,186 --> 00:38:12,758
We cannot trust the
evidence anymore, D.B.

00:38:13,893 --> 00:38:15,898
You know how crazy that sounds?

00:38:15,898 --> 00:38:17,702
Do you disagree?
It doesn't matter

00:38:17,702 --> 00:38:19,171
whether I agree or not.

00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,210
If we can't trust
the evidence,

00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:23,314
then how are we gonna
stop this guy?

00:38:23,314 --> 00:38:24,716
Well, we still have Keri.

00:38:24,716 --> 00:38:26,053
She was in that
room being held.

00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,222
And if we are right,

00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,725
she will put Winthrop
in there with her.

00:38:28,725 --> 00:38:29,827
Maybe.

00:38:29,827 --> 00:38:31,866
Morgan says she can
barely remember anything.

00:38:31,866 --> 00:38:33,034
She was a cop.

00:38:33,034 --> 00:38:34,905
And a good one.
She's gonna remember.

00:38:34,905 --> 00:38:36,675
It's just gonna
take a little time.

00:38:38,011 --> 00:38:40,583
I'm gonna reach out
to a friend of ours.

00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:43,089
Why don't you go back to the
hospital and check in with Keri?

00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:45,828
See what you can do.

00:38:45,828 --> 00:38:47,198
Hey, it looks like
you're getting some rest.

00:38:47,198 --> 00:38:48,868
The doctor should be by
in a few minutes

00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,739
to get some readings.

00:38:50,739 --> 00:38:52,108
You should be
out of here soon.

00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,954
(gasping)

00:39:02,864 --> 00:39:04,000
Sir, you can't be here.

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,002
I'm just a friend.

00:39:05,002 --> 00:39:06,271
I don't think now
is a good time.

00:39:06,271 --> 00:39:07,273
Ms. Torres needs her rest.

00:39:07,273 --> 00:39:08,743
That's okay. I can wait.

00:39:08,743 --> 00:39:09,879
There's a lounge downstairs.

00:39:09,879 --> 00:39:12,151
If you give me your name,
I can have you paged.

00:39:12,151 --> 00:39:14,021
That's all right.
I'll-I'll check back.

00:39:30,356 --> 00:39:31,726
(laughs): Oh.

00:39:31,726 --> 00:39:33,963
D.B., good to see you.
Thanks for doing this.

00:39:33,963 --> 00:39:35,333
I know you're a busy lady.

00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:37,037
I'm never
too busy for you.

00:39:37,037 --> 00:39:39,108
Glad I had that layover.

00:39:39,108 --> 00:39:41,379
Did you get the e-mail
files I sent you?

00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,916
Oh, interesting reading.

00:39:42,916 --> 00:39:45,888
I'm always a sucker
for twin serial killers.

00:39:45,888 --> 00:39:47,158
Well, given the games
they're playing,

00:39:47,158 --> 00:39:48,795
I could really use an expert

00:39:48,795 --> 00:39:50,197
in criminal psychology.

00:39:50,197 --> 00:39:52,369
Cyber or otherwise.

00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:53,838
Well, I can tell you
this much.

00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:55,075
As far as killers go,

00:39:55,075 --> 00:39:57,681
Winthrop is a profiler's dream.

00:39:57,681 --> 00:39:58,883
How so?

00:39:58,883 --> 00:39:59,952
His behavior suggests

00:39:59,952 --> 00:40:02,123
that he is incapable
of working alone.

00:40:02,123 --> 00:40:03,894
Seems he needs
a dominant-submissive

00:40:03,894 --> 00:40:05,831
partnership
in order to kill.

00:40:05,831 --> 00:40:07,300
Which is why he sought
out his brother.

00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,806
Jared was easily
manipulated,

00:40:09,806 --> 00:40:11,009
easily led.

00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:12,411
All the way to prison.

00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:14,950
Winthrop let his brother
take the fall.

00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,789
But, in doing so,
he lost that loving feeling.

00:40:17,789 --> 00:40:19,894
Which is why he wants
to spring him now.

00:40:19,894 --> 00:40:22,099
He wants
his old partner back.

00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:24,069
But in the meantime,
he's a serial killer.

00:40:24,069 --> 00:40:26,241
He enjoys killing.

00:40:26,241 --> 00:40:27,878
But he needs help.

00:40:29,114 --> 00:40:30,984
And we think he found it.

00:40:30,984 --> 00:40:32,921
Based on our

00:40:32,921 --> 00:40:35,460
audio analysis of
the last crime scene,

00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,331
we heard somebody
else in that room.

00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:39,335
He has an accomplice.

00:40:39,335 --> 00:40:41,340
With Jared in prison,
it's more like a temp.

00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,776
And we both know

00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:44,981
temps are never
fully committed to the job.

00:40:44,981 --> 00:40:48,254
So, the partner's the key.

00:40:48,254 --> 00:40:52,263
The little bit of profiling
I'm doing right now tells me

00:40:52,263 --> 00:40:55,002
I'm not telling you anything
you don't already know.

00:40:56,439 --> 00:41:01,883
You read the part of the file
where Jared Briscoe stalked

00:41:01,883 --> 00:41:04,121
my daughter Maya?

00:41:04,121 --> 00:41:07,161
And you put a security detail
outside her house.

00:41:07,161 --> 00:41:09,032
Was that a mistake?

00:41:09,032 --> 00:41:10,334
No. You have to protect her.

00:41:11,904 --> 00:41:13,775
But she is also
your best chance

00:41:13,775 --> 00:41:16,457
of catching a man
who is going to kill again.

00:41:16,457 --> 00:41:17,925
The greater good.

00:41:17,925 --> 00:41:19,126
D.B., if you're

00:41:19,126 --> 00:41:20,994
not willing to put Maya

00:41:20,994 --> 00:41:23,997
into play in some
kind of a way,

00:41:23,997 --> 00:41:26,500
you need to take yourself
out of the equation.

00:41:28,101 --> 00:41:30,137
You know what
you're asking me?

00:41:30,137 --> 00:41:33,173
The same thing
you're asking yourself.

00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:57,030
You've been a bad boy.

00:41:58,465 --> 00:41:59,833
Get in.
