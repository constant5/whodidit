very big plans
tonight.

What you got?

we are going

00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,550
to dinner at Marcienne's.

00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,084
Steakhouse. Awesome.

00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,120
I called ahead.

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,521
The chef is going
to prepare you

00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,390
your own special
vegetarian dish.

00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,025
Then we're going dancing at Tao,

00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,660
where I got us a VIP table.

00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,128
Ooh... fun.

00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:03,063
Maybe we'll run
into Kim and Kanye.

00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,131
Yes.

Oh, waiter.
Excuse me.

00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:09,169
Could we have a very nice
bottle of champagne?

Finn, it's, like, barely 9:00

orange juice.

have a few hours

00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,147

conference starts.

00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,317
Excellent.

in the morning.

a goopy one.

Yep.

drew the short straw

Where'd you find the body?

00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:47,674
Abandoned construction site.

00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:50,043
Real estate agent took
one look inside this drum

00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,111

00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,046
Killer must have used something

the body.

just call me Dr. Jane.

You probably know that.

00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,510
I've read your book.

00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,078
Oh, lucky you.
So if you have a copy,

00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:39,212
I'm happy to autograph it.

00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,181
Oh, no. Sorry, I forgot.

00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:42,682

00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,184

"Defending Your Evidence:

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,489
How to Avoid Getting
Skewered on the Stand."

00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,690
That is a great title.

00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:53,560

I know it is.

00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,095

is an art form.

00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,072
I'll sign it
for all of you.

00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,377
All right, what is
the story with you two?

00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:13,346
We were criminalists together
back in San Francisco,

00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,048
and then she switched sides.

00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,584
She became an expert
witness for the defense.

00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:20,153
Did she, uh, "skewer" you
on the stand?

00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,488
No, no, no.
Not me,

00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,290
but a trainee of mine.
It was his first time

00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,658
on the stand, and
he was nervous,

00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,293
and she made him seem
completely incompetent.

00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:29,229
She questioned
his protocol, his ethics.

00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:30,530
BRODY: Guess that's why
those defense attorneys

00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,765
pay her the big bucks.

00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,300
SIDLE: Yeah, well, in exchange
for a fat paycheck,

00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,702
she helped put a rapist
back on the street, so...

00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,471
That is quite a display
you have there.

00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,041
Thank you.

00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,577
It's the latest in digital
downloading software.

00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,278
How does it work?

00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,747
Uh, let's say you
witnessed a crime,

00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,282
captured part of it
on your phone.

00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,418
This software allows
law enforcement to download

00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:52,986
your most recent
photos and videos

00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,020
right on the spot.

00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,289
No access to
e-mails and texts.

00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,991
No need to give up your phone.

00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,159
Fascinating.

00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,127
I wouldn't mind a demonstration.

00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,395
SIDLE:
I think Morgan and I

00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,698
are gonna go check out
the new tape lifts.

00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,499
Yeah. I... that's...

00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,701
Bye.

00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,036
Looking good, Finn.

00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,104
Oh, thank you.

00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,472
I was hoping you'd be here.

00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,174
Getting off
in a couple of hours.

00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,442
Buy you a drink?

00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,412
Absolutely.

00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,148
Based on the narrow sciatic
notch of the pelvic bone,

00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,217
I can tell you
our victim is male.

00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,486
What about race? Or age?

00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,657
The, uh, frontal suture
in the skull is closed,

00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,392
telling me that
he's older than 18,

00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,593
but beyond that, I can't say.

00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,128
As for race,

00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,463
if you'll take a look

00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:38,064
at the maxillary bones,
you can see

00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,299
they have a parabolic shape,

00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:40,734
indicating
European descent.

00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:45,405
So, adult white male, shot
with a medium-caliber pistol.

00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:49,109
We found this bullet when we
poured him through the sifter.

00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:52,145
Looks like he was shot
execution style.

00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,581
Doc, you gonna be
able to extract DNA

00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,416
from his dental pulp?

00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,419
No, there's a risk
of bacterial contamination.

00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,121
Our best chance
for DNA

00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,290
is extracting marrow
from the femur.

00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,558
If we can get a profile,
we'll run it through CODIS.

00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:09,462
Maybe somebody's missing
our goop man here.

00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:19,272
I can't believe you signed us up
for Snyder's presentation.

00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,042
That was, like, two weeks ago.

00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,710
How was I supposed
to know you had

00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,645
some kind of history
with Dr. Jane?

00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,680
I think it'll be fun.

00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,415
I went on YouTube,
watched some of her videos.

00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:30,350
I think she's gonna
be pretty entertaining.

00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,418
Looking for someone?

00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:35,121
A certain vendor, perhaps?

00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,424
Yes, his name is Mark, and he is
meeting me here for a drink.

00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,726
Well, please be careful.

00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:42,295
Last time you picked up a guy...

00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,363
No, no, no, no.

00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:46,433
I have known him
for a very, very long time.

00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:47,667
Really?
Yeah.

00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,202
How do you know
each other?

00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,705
Well, I met him five years ago
at a conference.

00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:54,107
We spent some quality time
together,

00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,209
and it's been
an annual tradition ever since.

00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,044
So, you only see him
once a year?

00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,213
Well, he lives
in Boston.

00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,583
And the rest of the time,
you just talk and text?

00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,719
It's not really
that kind of relationship.

00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,287
It's, um...

00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:08,488
We're just having a good time.

00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,290
That's what I
wish I could do.

00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,758
When a guy asks
me out, I...

00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:15,161
it's like I have to make a pro
and con list before I say yes.

00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,430
That's all right. It sounds like
you're looking for Mr. Right.

00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,631
There's nothing wrong
with that.

00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,300
Yeah, and I just think
that relationships

00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,701
are really hard, and it's just

00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,304
easier sometimes to...
keep it fun.

00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,040
Less of a chance
of getting hurt.

00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,141
Yeah, not so many
disappointments.

00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,542
SIDLE:
Well, that's true.

00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,312
But then you never get to make
a real connection with someone.

00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:35,215
I mean, to be with somebody
who really gets you,

00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:38,418
who loves you for who you are--
I don't know.

00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:40,086
I think it's worth the risk.

00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,990
Especially when he's
as hot as that.

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,695

Bye, girls.

00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,232
We're not gonna see her
for the rest of this...

00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,967
The whole time--
she's gone, she's gone.

00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,985
Reduced to a jar of goop.

00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,553
Not how I'd want to end up.

00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,157
Pretty sure our victim didn't
want to end up that way, either.

00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,692
No, I plan on being
meticulously embalmed.

00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:23,997
My chiseled features perfectly
preserved for all of eternity,

00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:27,567
before being entombed alongside
my mother in a marble mausoleum.

00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,203
You've given this a lot
of thought, haven't you?

00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,404
Haven't you?

00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,540
Oh, I don't know.
You know, cremate me.

00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,975
Sprinkle me over a farm
so I can be of use.

00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,177
Have you figured out

00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,112
how this guy
got turned into goop?

00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,147
Muriatic acid.

00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:44,417
Killer probably assumed that it
would dissolve the entire body,

00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,686
but didn't count on the fact
that the decomp process itself

00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:49,222
gradually weakens the acid.

00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,757
Unfortunately,
you can find this stuff

00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,059
in any home improvement store
in the country,

00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,161
so it doesn't really help us
I.D. the killer.

00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,696

00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,364

Paul Carson.

Security guard
from Henderson.

00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,036
His wife
reported him missing.

00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,437
Said he left for
work three days ago,

00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,738
never came back.

There's a BOLO out on his van.

00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,409
Do we know where he worked?
The Mediterranean.

00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,544
Isn't that
where the conference is?

00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,280
Yeah, and get this--
according to the hotel manager,

00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,150
Carson's key card was used
just a few hours ago.

00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,319
So, his killer could be
at the hotel right now.

used his key card
today at the hotel.

this new software

00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,690
she got from one of the vendors,

00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,258

His-his key card
was taken.

00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:47,240
That's probably how the shooter

00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,141
gained access to
the control room.

00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,988
Which I'm sure
is gonna be really soon.

00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,491
Kind of romantic.

00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,393
Here with you.

00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,028
Dim lighting.

00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:45,031
This whole bleeding
from the stomach thing

00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:46,566
is kind of killing
the mood, isn't it?

00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,335
You're losing way
too much blood.

00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,009
A tampon?

00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,011
Believe it or not,
these things were really used

00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,280
in the 19th century
to plug bullet holes.

00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,987
Ooh.

00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,188
Ooh...
I'm sorry.

00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,625
So...

00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,660
you know sports and history.

00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,695
Just basic first aid.

00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,563
You're doing great.

00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,599
Really wish that I had
gone through with my...

00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,534
choice to go to med school
right about now.

00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:24,403
(groans)
I wish you did, too.

00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,372
Why didn't you?

00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:28,641
I took a lecture

00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,309
with this guy
Alec Jeffreys

00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,678
on DNA fingerprinting,
and that was it.

00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,647
I wanted to be a criminalist.

00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:37,650
I slept through
a lot of lectures.

00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,418
Had a lot of fun, though.

00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,088
Wish I knew you back then.

00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:43,623
Oh, come on,
I'm still fun.

00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,524
Just wait till
I get out of here.

00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,260
I'll hold you to that.

00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,428
It's gonna be okay.

00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,242
Let's go, let's go.

00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,049
Go!

00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:16,122
Hands!

00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:17,156
Show me your hands!

00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,524
Don't shoot.
Get on
the ground!

00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,558
Okay.
On the ground now!

00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,293
He needs help!
Now! On the ground!

00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,294
On the ground now!
Okay!

00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,563
Now!
He needs help. Don't shoot.

00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:25,765
Now!
Okay, okay, okay.

00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,166
He shot Perry.

00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,567
I thought he was going
to shoot me, too.

00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,002
Frame up on his face.

00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:33,739
ECKLIE:
He's got dark hair.

00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,374
According to Sara,

00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:36,709
our gunman had
long blond hair.

00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,444
Well, you gotta go with Sara.

00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:39,612
She's a trained observer.

00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,614
(sighs)

00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,350
ECKLIE:
That's not our guy.
Let him go.

00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,584
Cut him loose,
that's not our guy.

00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,688
Let's go!
Move, let's go, let's go!

00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,657
RUSSELL:
The gunman could've shot
that guy, but he didn't.

00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,559
Why not?

00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,294
His lucky day.
Who knows?

00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,395
Oh, it's gotta
be more than that.

00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,596
It's gotta be
something else.

00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,432
Where... come
here, look-it.

00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:02,334
The shooting began
in Conference Room A, right?

00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,369
Yeah.
According
to Sara,

00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,337
at 4:17 the
shooter comes in

00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,505
through the
side door here,

00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:10,176
shoots here,
here and here,

00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:11,544
but never fires
into this area.

00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,745
Then he goes down
the hallway here,

00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:15,281
past B and C,

00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,149
all the way to
Conference Room D.

00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,751
And then he shoots the place up.
Why?

00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,352
Why'd he skip
those two rooms?

00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,554
Maybe nobody was in them.

00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,089
No. No, no, I checked.

00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,256
All four rooms,

00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,991
at the time of the
shooting, were filled.

00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,126
I mean, that's what

00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,260
a spree killer wants, right,

00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,262
is a high body count?
So why not

00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,098
shoot up the casino,
for God's sake?

00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:34,500
Or at least
the pool area?

00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,001
You're right.

00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,369
He's upstairs,
where the rooms are.

00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,637
Doors are locked.
No crowds.

00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:40,239
And no way out.

00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,474
No, no. No.
This guy

00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,476
is targeting
these areas.

00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,010
Right there.

00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,545
You're saying he's looking
for specific people.

00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,547
This is not
a random killing spree.

00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,118
Our gunman has a hit list.

00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,225
♪♪ ♪♪

00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:32,024
♪♪ ♪♪

00:21:47,146 --> 00:21:47,866
She was a mom.

00:21:47,866 --> 00:21:51,865
I noticed a C-section scar

00:21:51,865 --> 00:21:53,626
when I did my initial exam.

00:21:57,597 --> 00:21:59,933
That's Morgan's friend.

00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:01,935
The one she tried to save.

00:22:01,935 --> 00:22:03,236
Gave her CPR.

00:22:04,637 --> 00:22:07,173
Size of a .223.

00:22:07,173 --> 00:22:09,676
Consistent with an AR-15.

00:22:09,676 --> 00:22:12,245
America's favorite
assault rifle.

00:22:12,245 --> 00:22:15,081
Capable of firing
700 rounds a minute.

00:22:15,081 --> 00:22:17,517
That kind of firepower
belongs in a war zone,

00:22:17,517 --> 00:22:19,052
not on our streets.

00:22:19,052 --> 00:22:22,355
Our killer wanted to make
sure that he hit his targets.

00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:24,257
He didn't care
who else he shot.

00:22:24,257 --> 00:22:26,893
I wasn't aware that he was going
after specific people.

00:22:26,893 --> 00:22:29,896
Some of these victims were
most likely collateral,

00:22:29,896 --> 00:22:31,464
but the rest were
on his hit list.

00:22:31,464 --> 00:22:34,033
I just need to figure out
what they had in common

00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:37,370
so maybe we can figure out
who he's going after next.

00:22:38,071 --> 00:22:50,049

00:23:19,546 --> 00:23:21,981

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,183
Heard you found
Paul Carson's van.

00:23:57,183 --> 00:23:59,285
Yeah, abandoned in an alley
behind a strip joint

00:23:59,285 --> 00:24:00,587
off of Fremont Street.

00:24:00,587 --> 00:24:02,121
Yeah, that part of town,

00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:03,389
nobody's quick to call the cops.

00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:04,157
Well, the killer's smart.

00:24:04,157 --> 00:24:06,593
Just like he thought
he'd conceal Carson's I.D.

00:24:06,593 --> 00:24:07,961
by turning his body into goop.

00:24:07,961 --> 00:24:09,262
Yeah, he didn't want
anything to get in the way

00:24:09,262 --> 00:24:11,264
of his shooting up
the hotel today.

00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,600
His wife reported him
missing three days ago.

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,635
We know that Carson
went to work.

00:24:15,635 --> 00:24:17,604
So I pulled hotel surveillance,

00:24:17,604 --> 00:24:19,906
and you can clearly see his van

00:24:19,906 --> 00:24:21,541
parked in his usual spot.

00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,543
But then I noticed something.

00:24:23,543 --> 00:24:24,677
Check out this guy
in the hoodie.

00:24:24,677 --> 00:24:27,080
You can't see his face,
and it looks like

00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,314
he's walking past the van,

00:24:28,314 --> 00:24:30,216
yet he never exits frame.

00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:33,219
So he broke
into the back of the van,

00:24:33,219 --> 00:24:35,922
and then waited for Carson
to get off work.

00:24:39,893 --> 00:24:41,127
Drive!

00:24:42,562 --> 00:24:45,999
And forced him to drive to the
abandoned construction site.

00:24:45,999 --> 00:24:49,102
Shot him, dumped his body
into the barrel.

00:24:49,102 --> 00:24:51,638
<i>Poured muriatic acid on him</i>

00:24:51,638 --> 00:24:54,374
<i>to dissolve the body.</i>

00:25:01,347 --> 00:25:02,649
Then got rid of the van.

00:25:02,982 --> 00:25:05,218
And the only image we
have of this guy...

00:25:05,218 --> 00:25:07,353
we can't make out the face?

00:25:07,353 --> 00:25:09,956
No, but we might have his DNA.

00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:13,192
I found this used tissue
underneath the backseat.

00:25:13,192 --> 00:25:14,460
According to Carson's wife,

00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,196
Carson was the only one
who used the van.

00:25:17,196 --> 00:25:20,133
I suppose that could've come
from the shooter's pocket.

00:25:20,133 --> 00:25:21,534
Have Henry run
that, all right?

00:25:21,534 --> 00:25:24,237
Tell him to put it in
the front of the line.

00:25:24,237 --> 00:25:28,141
HODGES:
This eyewitness software
is incredible.

00:25:28,141 --> 00:25:30,510
No more scanning through
endless hours of footage.

00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:33,079
Yeah. Finn's friend
Mark was selling it.

00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:34,447
You just punch in the
time frame, and that's

00:25:34,447 --> 00:25:35,915
the only footage
it downloads.

00:25:35,915 --> 00:25:38,384
Hopefully one of the cameras
caught the shooter.

00:25:38,384 --> 00:25:40,253
Have you heard
from Finn yet?

00:25:40,253 --> 00:25:42,588
She's still stuck
in the elevator.

00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:45,224
Well, I'm sure
they'll get them out soon.

00:25:45,224 --> 00:25:46,492
Yeah.

00:25:48,061 --> 00:25:50,029
That's the door
that the shooter came in.

00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:52,131
Damn. He's blocked

00:25:52,131 --> 00:25:54,233
behind a pillar.
All right, let me try

00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:55,902
another clip.

00:26:03,076 --> 00:26:04,644
That must've been terrifying.

00:26:04,644 --> 00:26:06,646
Yeah. It was.

00:26:06,646 --> 00:26:08,648
You know, you don't have
to be here for this.

00:26:08,648 --> 00:26:10,149
I can take care of it.

00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:12,585
I want to be here.

00:26:14,387 --> 00:26:16,389
You know, when I heard
about what happened,

00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:18,491
I was really worried.

00:26:18,491 --> 00:26:19,993
I just...

00:26:21,461 --> 00:26:24,330
I'm-I'm just glad you're okay.

00:26:32,338 --> 00:26:33,940
Thank you.

00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,345
Can we, um, scroll forward

00:26:39,345 --> 00:26:40,913
frame by frame? I think

00:26:40,913 --> 00:26:43,049
we might get something.

00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:44,450
That's him.

00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:45,551
Okay, let me zoom in.

00:26:45,551 --> 00:26:46,652
I'll isolate his face,

00:26:46,652 --> 00:26:49,389
run it through
facial recognition.

00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:55,128
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:26:55,128 --> 00:26:57,196
Morgan got an I.D.--
Jeff Lasky.

00:26:57,196 --> 00:26:59,599
26-year-old out of Phoenix.

00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:01,000
I have a warrant
for the guy's cell phone.

00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,335
See if we can triangulate that.

00:27:05,638 --> 00:27:07,306
RUSSELL:
That's just gonna tell us

00:27:07,306 --> 00:27:08,941
he's still in the hotel, right?

00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:10,209
If we tap into his Wi-Fi,

00:27:10,209 --> 00:27:11,944
we can track him down
to within a few feet.

00:27:20,586 --> 00:27:22,321
Suspect's name is Jeff Lasky.

00:27:22,321 --> 00:27:25,158
He's on the ninth floor,
heading east.

00:27:25,158 --> 00:27:27,460
MAN:
Copy that.

00:27:29,462 --> 00:27:31,497
Ready? Go!

00:27:33,066 --> 00:27:35,168
There he is!

00:27:35,168 --> 00:27:38,104
Drop the gun!

00:27:38,104 --> 00:27:39,972
Drop the gun now!

00:27:40,273 --> 00:27:41,641
It's over, Lasky. Drop the gun!

00:27:41,641 --> 00:27:42,608
Now!

00:28:03,196 --> 00:28:04,630
Drop the gun now!

00:28:26,052 --> 00:28:28,154
Shots fired! Shots fired!
Suspect is down.

00:28:29,255 --> 00:28:31,958
MAN:
All right, move in. Check him.

00:28:33,326 --> 00:28:36,229
MAN: We got him. All right,
continue sweep. Let's go!

00:28:36,229 --> 00:28:38,297
All right,
get the bomb dogs in there

00:28:38,297 --> 00:28:40,166
and sweep the hotel.
Make sure this guy

00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:42,101
did not leave us any surprises.

00:28:42,101 --> 00:28:43,903
Let's get Finn
out of the elevator.

00:28:43,903 --> 00:28:45,004
ECKLIE:
And give engineering

00:28:45,004 --> 00:28:46,038
an all clear.

00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:48,040
(phone dings)

00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,376
They got him.

00:28:50,376 --> 00:28:51,978
They're gonna get
us out of here.

00:28:51,978 --> 00:28:53,179
Mark, can you hear me?

00:28:53,179 --> 00:28:54,347
They're coming
to get you right now.

00:28:57,884 --> 00:28:59,018
Celine.

00:28:59,018 --> 00:29:00,253
What?

00:29:00,253 --> 00:29:02,455
Dion.

00:29:02,455 --> 00:29:04,223
Show later.

00:29:04,223 --> 00:29:05,925
Oh. Yeah.

00:29:05,925 --> 00:29:07,493
I guess I'm more
of a U2 kind of girl.

00:29:10,129 --> 00:29:13,633
You know, uh,
I saw them in Ireland.

00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:17,003
Haven't been.

00:29:17,003 --> 00:29:19,605
What? To a U2 concert?

00:29:19,605 --> 00:29:22,942
To Ireland.

00:29:22,942 --> 00:29:25,011
It was amazing.

00:29:25,011 --> 00:29:27,380
I, uh, was there
on a Eurail pass,

00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,916
and I was hanging out
at a bar in Dublin,

00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:33,019
and all of a sudden U2 walked
right in and they...

00:29:33,019 --> 00:29:34,554
started...

00:29:36,088 --> 00:29:37,023
No!

00:29:37,023 --> 00:29:38,558
Oh, God! Mark?

00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:40,426
Come on, come on.
You can do it.

00:29:40,426 --> 00:29:42,361
Breathe, breathe.

00:29:43,196 --> 00:29:45,097
Mark, breathe.
(grunting)

00:29:46,065 --> 00:29:46,933
Mark?

00:29:49,602 --> 00:29:50,636
(doors open)

00:29:50,636 --> 00:29:52,505
(groans)

00:29:52,505 --> 00:29:54,307
He just crashed!
I didn't get a pulse.

00:29:54,307 --> 00:29:56,609
All right,
we'll take it from here.

00:29:56,609 --> 00:29:58,945
You got him?
Yeah.

00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:01,681
Get a line in here!
Breathe, Mark.

00:30:02,315 --> 00:30:04,483
Phoenix PD did a search
of Lasky's house.

00:30:04,483 --> 00:30:06,586
Apparently he was obsessed
with the man

00:30:06,586 --> 00:30:08,521
who murdered his wife
and daughter three months ago.

00:30:08,521 --> 00:30:10,389
Uh, Luke Reaser.

00:30:10,389 --> 00:30:13,159
Luke Reaser?
I heard about that case.

00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:15,294
He raped them
before he killed them, right?

00:30:15,294 --> 00:30:17,029
That was Lasky's family?

00:30:17,029 --> 00:30:18,531
Yeah, that's enough to put
anybody over the edge.

00:30:18,531 --> 00:30:19,599
Yeah, but Reaser was caught.

00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:20,967
He's awaiting trial.

00:30:20,967 --> 00:30:22,668
Why would Lasky go
on a rampage today?

00:30:22,668 --> 00:30:24,270
Because Reaser
should've been put

00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,972
behind bars a long time ago.

00:30:25,972 --> 00:30:27,373
He raped and murdered
a teenage girl

00:30:27,373 --> 00:30:29,642
back in 2012 in Texas.

00:30:29,642 --> 00:30:32,078
Set the place on fire
in order to cover his tracks.

00:30:32,078 --> 00:30:34,247
The evidence wasn't
strong enough to convict.

00:30:34,247 --> 00:30:37,383
So, then he moves to Phoenix,
where he murders Lasky's family.

00:30:37,383 --> 00:30:40,486
You know, Morgan, three of the
CSIs that were killed today,

00:30:40,486 --> 00:30:42,355
they were from the crime lab
in Dallas.

00:30:42,355 --> 00:30:44,223
Lasky must've blamed them

00:30:44,223 --> 00:30:45,925
for putting Reaser
back on the street.

00:30:45,925 --> 00:30:48,227
They're not the only ones
he was gunning for.

00:30:48,227 --> 00:30:49,462
Guess who testified

00:30:49,462 --> 00:30:51,297
for the defense.

00:30:51,297 --> 00:30:53,599
Of course I'll talk
to the press.

00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:54,600
We need to give

00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,335
WNE the exclusive, though.

00:30:56,335 --> 00:30:57,370
Now?

00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:58,504
I can take care of that.

00:30:58,504 --> 00:30:59,505
He was after you.

00:30:59,505 --> 00:31:01,941
I'll call you back.

00:31:02,074 --> 00:31:03,276
The gunman, Jeff Lasky.

00:31:03,276 --> 00:31:06,212
Ring a bell?
What about Luke Reaser?

00:31:06,212 --> 00:31:07,546
You helped put
that son of a bitch

00:31:07,546 --> 00:31:09,248
back on the street,
and he went on

00:31:09,248 --> 00:31:10,283
to murder Lasky's family.

00:31:10,283 --> 00:31:12,318
If I remember correctly,

00:31:12,318 --> 00:31:13,653
the prosecution didn't have

00:31:13,653 --> 00:31:15,054
that much evidence
against Reaser.

00:31:15,054 --> 00:31:17,323
And what they did
have was mishandled.

00:31:17,323 --> 00:31:19,558
No, no, no, no.
I talked to the lab in Dallas.

00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:22,361
A DNA analyst transposed
two numbers on a piece of paper.

00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:24,397
It was a simple mistake, Jane.

00:31:24,397 --> 00:31:26,332
And someone in the lab
should have caught it.

00:31:26,332 --> 00:31:28,134
A guilty man went free
because of a typo.

00:31:28,134 --> 00:31:30,603
It was sloppy work.

00:31:30,603 --> 00:31:32,605
Who knows what other
mistakes that lab made?

00:31:33,939 --> 00:31:35,541
You used to care
about the truth.

00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:37,643
Come on, Sara.

00:31:37,643 --> 00:31:39,378
We're not on
the same side anymore.

00:31:39,378 --> 00:31:40,646
It's my job to poke the holes

00:31:40,646 --> 00:31:42,181
in the science.
And put on

00:31:42,181 --> 00:31:44,016
a show for the jury, right?

00:31:44,016 --> 00:31:47,453
Luke Reaser raped
and killed Jeff Lasky's

00:31:47,453 --> 00:31:49,121
wife and five-year-old daughter.

00:31:49,121 --> 00:31:50,156
Slit their throats

00:31:50,156 --> 00:31:51,924
and then dumped their
bodies in the trash.

00:31:51,924 --> 00:31:54,060
That's why Lasky
went on this rampage.

00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,996
11 people are dead
because of you.

00:31:56,996 --> 00:31:59,065
I didn't put the gun
in Lasky's hand.

00:31:59,065 --> 00:32:00,066
No, you kind of did.

00:32:00,066 --> 00:32:01,367
Lasky sent you e-mails.

00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:02,968
He sent you threats
over a month ago.

00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:04,070
You didn't report it.

00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,905
I get threats
all the time.

00:32:05,905 --> 00:32:06,939
News flash, Sara,

00:32:06,939 --> 00:32:08,674
I'm a woman with
strong opinions.

00:32:08,674 --> 00:32:10,042
Some people

00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:11,410
just don't like me.

00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,546
Uh-uh.

00:32:13,546 --> 00:32:15,014
None of this would've happened

00:32:15,014 --> 00:32:17,249
if you had just gone
to the police, Jane.

00:32:18,651 --> 00:32:20,953
Why don't you put that
in your press conference?

00:32:34,467 --> 00:32:36,001
Keep me posted, then.

00:32:36,502 --> 00:32:38,671
Take a look at this.
SWAT found

00:32:38,671 --> 00:32:41,474
this man's body in the doorway
of his room on the 15th floor.

00:32:41,474 --> 00:32:42,908
Looks like he was shot
when he opened the door.

00:32:42,908 --> 00:32:45,311
Hotel security said
it happened at 4:17.

00:32:45,311 --> 00:32:47,513
That's when the shooting started
in Conference Room A.

00:32:47,513 --> 00:32:49,615
Lasky couldn't have been
two places at once.

00:32:50,883 --> 00:32:52,418
I think there had to be
a second shooter.

00:32:52,585 --> 00:32:54,954
You may be right.
Got DNA off of that

00:32:54,954 --> 00:32:57,056
used tissue I found in
the security guard's van.

00:32:57,056 --> 00:32:58,924
Jeff Lasky didn't kill him.

00:32:58,924 --> 00:33:00,326
But DNA did
come back

00:33:00,326 --> 00:33:01,494
with a match to this guy.

00:33:01,494 --> 00:33:02,928
Cliff Ballard.

00:33:02,928 --> 00:33:04,997
I've seen him before.

00:33:04,997 --> 00:33:07,166
<i>Yeah, this is the guy</i>
<i>that SWAT found</i>

00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:09,268
<i>standing over a body</i>
<i>in the hallway.</i>

00:33:09,268 --> 00:33:12,071
He was unarmed
and acting scared,

00:33:12,071 --> 00:33:13,606
like he was just
another hotel guest.

00:33:13,606 --> 00:33:15,408
SANDERS:
Well, that's why Sara
only saw one shooter.

00:33:15,408 --> 00:33:17,476
'Cause Lasky was shooting up
the conference rooms

00:33:17,476 --> 00:33:19,578
while Ballard was shooting
people upstairs.

00:33:19,578 --> 00:33:21,614
Yeah, well,
SWAT let this guy go.

00:33:21,614 --> 00:33:23,315
He's still in the hotel.

00:33:48,941 --> 00:33:52,066
SWAT's still
searching the hotel.

00:33:52,066 --> 00:33:52,864
No sign of Ballard.

00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,165
Please tell me
you found something.

00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:56,244
Actually, Ballard was a CSI.

00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:57,945
And he just got
out of prison.

00:33:57,945 --> 00:34:00,181
Served nine years
for felony fraud.

00:34:00,181 --> 00:34:01,416
Falsifying evidence.

00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:04,485
Yeah, didn't he work out of
the crime lab in Baltimore?

00:34:04,485 --> 00:34:05,052
Yeah.

00:34:05,052 --> 00:34:06,521
Well, I remember
when he was arrested.

00:34:06,521 --> 00:34:08,122
It was this huge scandal.

00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:11,259
Every case he worked on
was called into question.

00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:12,360
Well, maybe

00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,128
he blames his coworkers
for turning him in.

00:34:14,128 --> 00:34:15,129
No, no,

00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:16,564
'cause then he would've shot up

00:34:16,564 --> 00:34:18,399
the lab in Baltimore.
No.

00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,903
All of Ballard's work
would have been audited

00:34:21,903 --> 00:34:24,138
by a team of
forensic experts, right?

00:34:24,138 --> 00:34:25,606
Criminalists from
all over the country,

00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:28,509
selected to evaluate his cases.

00:34:28,509 --> 00:34:30,311
They're the ones
who put him in prison.

00:34:30,311 --> 00:34:32,013
Could be his targets.

00:34:32,013 --> 00:34:33,881
Let me see if I can find out

00:34:33,881 --> 00:34:35,116
who was on
that team.

00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:37,018
I've been through all of

00:34:37,018 --> 00:34:38,085
Jeff Lasky's e-mails,

00:34:38,085 --> 00:34:39,954
his phone records,
his texts,

00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:41,189
his Web history.
I can't find

00:34:41,189 --> 00:34:43,024
any evidence that he's
working with Ballard.

00:34:43,024 --> 00:34:45,426
All right, so what do we know
about our two shooters?

00:34:45,426 --> 00:34:46,427
Lasky...

00:34:46,427 --> 00:34:48,196
<i>the grieving father, husband</i>

00:34:48,196 --> 00:34:51,132
<i>that wanted to get even with</i>
<i>the murder of his family.</i>

00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:52,467
Ballard's the ex-con

00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:54,869
<i>who, presumably,</i>
<i>is going after the people</i>

00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:55,470
who put him in prison.

00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,104
Two different shooters...

00:34:57,104 --> 00:34:58,139
two different agendas.

00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:02,143
But with one
big thing in common:

00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:03,478
They both hate

00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:04,445
law enforcement.

00:35:04,445 --> 00:35:06,113
Now, we've been assuming
that the shooters

00:35:06,113 --> 00:35:07,281
were working together, right?

00:35:07,281 --> 00:35:08,382
What if they weren't?

00:35:08,382 --> 00:35:10,318
So they both go on a rampage

00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:11,919
same time, same place?

00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:12,920
We've been
looking

00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,422
for a connection
between these guys

00:35:14,422 --> 00:35:15,623
and we haven't found one,

00:35:15,623 --> 00:35:16,924
so maybe their connection

00:35:16,924 --> 00:35:18,292
is the conference itself.

00:35:18,292 --> 00:35:19,393
I mean, think about this.

00:35:19,393 --> 00:35:21,529
Once a year, CSIs and cops

00:35:21,529 --> 00:35:23,531
from all over the country
get together

00:35:23,531 --> 00:35:24,432
at this conference.

00:35:24,432 --> 00:35:26,400
Now, if you had a beef
with law enforcement,

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,970
what better place
to come than right here?

00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,438
I found that list of people

00:35:30,438 --> 00:35:31,973
who served on
Ballard's audit.

00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:36,177
That guy, right there.

00:35:36,177 --> 00:35:39,013
That's the guy that Ballard was
standing over in the hallway.

00:35:39,013 --> 00:35:41,282
He must've killed him
right before SWAT arrived.

00:35:42,049 --> 00:35:43,150
SANDERS:
Sara.

00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,418
Oh, God.

00:35:44,418 --> 00:35:45,419
She was on that team.

00:35:45,419 --> 00:35:46,921
Notify SWAT.

00:35:46,921 --> 00:35:48,155
I'll call Sara.

00:35:49,524 --> 00:35:51,626
I'm on the 18th floor.

00:35:51,626 --> 00:35:52,627
I got a text.

00:35:52,627 --> 00:35:55,229
Cliff Ballard?

00:35:55,229 --> 00:35:56,531
He's in prison.

00:35:56,531 --> 00:35:58,199
BALLARD:
I got out in August.

00:35:59,967 --> 00:36:00,902
Give me the phone.

00:36:00,902 --> 00:36:02,236
All right.

00:36:03,437 --> 00:36:04,572
Now the gun.

00:36:10,044 --> 00:36:11,279
(gun clatters on floor)

00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:14,115
The text telling me
to come up here...

00:36:14,115 --> 00:36:15,316
it was from you, wasn't it?

00:36:15,316 --> 00:36:17,418
I wanted to get you alone.

00:36:17,418 --> 00:36:19,353
This woman, Linda Gage?

00:36:19,353 --> 00:36:21,289
She was part of the review team.

00:36:21,289 --> 00:36:22,390
You killed her, didn't you?

00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,392
She helped send me to prison.

00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:26,427
Just like you.

00:36:26,427 --> 00:36:28,229
It was not personal.

00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:29,897
We were just asked to take
a look at your work.

00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:31,232
I was a good criminalist.

00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:32,099
I know you were, Cliff.

00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:34,502
You did a lot of good work
over the years.

00:36:34,502 --> 00:36:37,038
I put rapists and murderers
behind bars.

00:36:37,038 --> 00:36:39,006
They were all guilty.

00:36:39,006 --> 00:36:40,441
They deserved what they got.

00:36:40,441 --> 00:36:43,344
I'm sure they did, but...

00:36:43,344 --> 00:36:47,081
you tampered with the evidence
to get the results you wanted.

00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:49,550
I didn't have a choice.

00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,551
The detectives

00:36:50,551 --> 00:36:52,086
come to you.

00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:53,387
They want a slam dunk.

00:36:53,387 --> 00:36:55,456
Evidence isn't always like that.

00:36:55,456 --> 00:36:57,425
It's a lot of pressure.
I've been there many times.

00:36:57,425 --> 00:37:00,127
Convictions hinge on
conclusive evidence,

00:37:00,127 --> 00:37:01,596
and if you don't
have enough,

00:37:01,596 --> 00:37:03,898
you feel like a failure.

00:37:04,899 --> 00:37:06,033
I had to do something.

00:37:06,033 --> 00:37:07,401
I understand.

00:37:07,401 --> 00:37:08,536
It's natural to want

00:37:08,536 --> 00:37:09,904
to help the case
along, to...

00:37:09,904 --> 00:37:11,439
You don't understand!

00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:13,908
If you did, you wouldn't
have helped send me away!

00:37:13,908 --> 00:37:14,909
Cliff, wait.

00:37:14,909 --> 00:37:16,043
You treated me like a criminal.

00:37:16,043 --> 00:37:16,544
(cocks gun)

00:37:16,544 --> 00:37:18,012
Destroyed my life!

00:37:20,548 --> 00:37:22,183
(gunshot)

00:37:24,452 --> 00:37:25,453
Move!

00:37:27,054 --> 00:37:28,255
You okay?

00:37:28,255 --> 00:37:30,458
You okay?
You good?

00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:32,059
Thank you. Yeah.

00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:33,561
SWAT OFFICER:
Shots fired, shots fired.

00:37:33,561 --> 00:37:34,595
Suspect down.

00:37:45,272 --> 00:37:47,274
(beeping steadily)

00:37:47,274 --> 00:37:49,276
(indistinct conversations)

00:37:50,478 --> 00:37:51,445
Hey.

00:37:51,445 --> 00:37:53,080
Hey.

00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,949
Nurse said you
were out of surgery

00:37:54,949 --> 00:37:56,017
and that you needed a visitor.

00:37:56,017 --> 00:37:58,386
Yep. I got to the Pearly Gates.

00:37:58,386 --> 00:37:59,420
They sent me back.

00:38:00,454 --> 00:38:02,556
I'm glad they did.

00:38:06,193 --> 00:38:07,962
You saved my life.

00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,165
Well, buy me dinner.

00:38:11,165 --> 00:38:12,299
We'll call it even.

00:38:14,568 --> 00:38:15,469
Deal.

00:38:17,171 --> 00:38:19,273
So the doctor said

00:38:19,273 --> 00:38:21,909
that you're gonna need
some time to recover.

00:38:21,909 --> 00:38:24,045
And that you cannot

00:38:24,045 --> 00:38:26,580
fly back to Boston for
at least two weeks, so...

00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:30,317
I was hoping that
maybe we could...

00:38:30,317 --> 00:38:32,153
hang out.

00:38:32,153 --> 00:38:34,989
You know, when you get
back up on your feet.

00:38:37,591 --> 00:38:39,093
You mean date?

00:38:39,093 --> 00:38:40,995
Yeah.

00:38:40,995 --> 00:38:42,930
Like, uh, dinner and a movie

00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,166
and a good-night kiss.

00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:47,501
Well, as you know,

00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:50,538
dating sometimes
can turn into a...

00:38:50,538 --> 00:38:51,539
(sighs)

00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:53,441
...real relationship.

00:38:55,576 --> 00:38:58,112
I'm willing to risk it.

00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:03,317
Me, too.

00:39:31,045 --> 00:39:32,980
Hydrogen peroxide.

00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,415
To clean off the blood.

00:39:38,352 --> 00:39:39,453
Thank you.

00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:44,225
We always wear gloves
when we go to the crime scene.

00:39:44,225 --> 00:39:46,994
You know?
We're never there...

00:39:46,994 --> 00:39:50,131
there when it...
when it actually happens.

00:39:50,131 --> 00:39:51,432
I know.

00:39:58,139 --> 00:39:59,907
Are you okay?

00:40:01,542 --> 00:40:03,210
I'm okay.

00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,245
Ballard wanted

00:40:04,245 --> 00:40:05,913
you dead, and...

00:40:05,913 --> 00:40:07,548
if SWAT hadn't been there...

00:40:07,548 --> 00:40:10,317
But they were.

00:40:21,495 --> 00:40:23,030
Finn called.

00:40:24,031 --> 00:40:25,099
She said

00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:27,067
they still have that
VIP table at Tao.

00:40:27,067 --> 00:40:28,068
(laughs)

00:40:31,605 --> 00:40:32,640
What do you think?

00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,509
Dancing... tequila...

00:40:37,912 --> 00:40:39,213
Yeah.

00:40:39,213 --> 00:40:40,948
Tequila sounds
pretty good, yeah.
