Hey, what's up, man?
Hey.

00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,246
Died with his boots off, huh?

00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,614
Yeah, must have been
quite an impact.

00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,449
Yeah. What's the driver say?

00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,383
She's still

00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,484
pretty shook up.
Crawford's waiting

00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:27,387
(sobbing)
to talk to her.

00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,289
What's the victim say?

00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,258
Let's ask.
Hey, Dave.

00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:32,693
Hmm?
Got an I.D.?

00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,227
No wallet, but...

00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,330
did find this.

00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,298
Looks like a
hotel key card.

00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,334
No identifying
marks on it.

00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:41,101
Well, I'll scan it

00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,002
when we get back to the lab.

00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,737
See if it has an I.D.
embedded in the, uh,

00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:46,206
magnetic strip.
He took the full force

00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,708
of the hit, didn't he, Dave?

00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:50,611
There are signs of extreme
blunt-force trauma.

00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,614
But I don't think this guy's
problems started with the car.

00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:54,715
Why's that?
Take a look

00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,417
at this sharp-force wound
on his neck.

00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:58,185
SANDERS:
Could've come from

00:01:58,185 --> 00:01:59,086
headlamp glass.

00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:01,188
True, but the blood
is mostly clotted.

00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,390
That means
the wound occurred earlier.

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,525
Hours earlier.
Check out the
guy's clothes.

00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,228
I mean, he's completely
covered in dirt.

00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,330
Something's not right, fellas.

00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,005
Yeah, here we go, Greg.
Check this out.

00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,207
Directional blood drops
suggest he was bleeding

00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:21,675
before he was hit
by that car.

00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,710
SANDERS:
Tail indicates

00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,212
he came from the desert.

00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,651
Oh. Here's another
one in the dirt.

00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,722
And more blood up here.

00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,759
This definitely wasn't caused
by the impact with that vehicle.

00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,630
Well,

00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,967

Ooh.

That ain't good.

was dead. Buried him.

STOKES:
But he was still alive and...

00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,406
must have crawled
his way out.

They're venomous

Coral snakes are

00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,720
from South America, but the
regal is found in, like, Panama.

00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,623
So how'd it end up in a
dead man's grave in Nevada?

00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:57,524
Good question.

00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,662
Our John Doe here suffered
massive blunt-force trauma.

00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,565
Numerous broken bones
and lacerated organs.

00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,167
Basilar
skull fracture.

00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,535
All from the impact of the car.

00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,471
That's what the C.O.D. said.
But David was right.

00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,539
The sharp-force injury

00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,441
to the neck
is tangential

00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:17,544
to the skin surface,
suggesting stabbing

00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:21,181
and tearing motion
caused by a person, not a car.

00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:24,718
Did find a tiny, clear
glass shard in the neck wound.

00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,754
RUSSELL: Maybe he was cut
with a broken bottle?

00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:30,724
ROBBINS: Could be. There was
also an odd abrasion pattern

00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,192
on the victim's cheek.

00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,160
Indentations
with a distinct marking.

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,996
Maybe a logo of some kind?

00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,732
I found traces
of a metal alloy in the wound.

00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,600
I'm thinking brass knuckles
caused it.

00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,136
Well, you don't hear about that
very often, do you?

00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:46,206
So he was incapacitated
with brass knuckles,

00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,441
stabbed in the neck
with a broken bottle,

00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,542
and then buried alive.

00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,212
And then his luck ran out
and he was hit by a car.

00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,347
I hope he wasn't
playing the ponies.

00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,716
Hey. Got an I.D.

His name is Jimmy Turelli.

00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,087
He is a recently paroled inmate.

00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,589
He, uh, was two years

00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,225
at Ely for grand larceny
and robbery.

00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,426
Long sheet.

00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,095
Ran numbers for Sam Braun
back in the day.

00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,397
When did Turelli get out?

00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,632
Two weeks ago.

00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,034
Brass knuckles.

00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:16,236
Mob-style body drop
in the desert.

00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,438
Maybe Turelli's past
caught up with him.

What does magnesium

00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:30,250
Sounds like your basic talcum
that is used in baby powder.

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,486
I found traces of it in the
abrasion on Turelli's cheek.

00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:37,057
I also found the alloy residue
in the wound is comprised

00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,592
of copper and zinc-- brass.

00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:42,062
So, what, a homicidal baby

00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,130
hits Jimmy Turelli
with brass knuckles?

00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,165

00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,600

From a sheep breed

00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,575
The fabric is used
to make expensive suits.

In this case,
dyed green.

00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,112

The glass is made

00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,758
of potassium oxide.

00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:15,595

00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,634
any other woolen cloth.

00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:31,371
All right. So that places
our vic near a pool table.

00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,072
That's not
the end

00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,740
of the pool game. You know
what a bridge is, right?

00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,575
Yes, young lady, I do.

00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,011
You use it
when it's a tricky shot

00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,280
and you can't get
to the cue ball.

00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,516
Exactly. Now, this bridge
is made of brass.

00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:46,119
Note the pattern.
RUSSELL:
Very similar to...

00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,454
brass knuckles.
BRODY: Right.

00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,756
Traces of talc
also point to billiards.

00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,192
Pool players use it
to keep their hands dry.

00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,227
All right. Tell me
about these champagne glasses.

That's what got me thinking.

00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:58,231

in Turelli's neck wound.

00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,732
I've seen trick-shot
artists make

00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,569
the champagne shot before.
And when they nail it,

00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,571
<i>they like to take their stick</i>

00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:07,273

00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,149
Okay.

00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:19,519

00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,098
He's, uh, kind of a
part-time pool hustler,

00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,533
full-time con artist.

00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:51,137
He was arrested a few times
for identity theft,

00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:54,273
and kicked out of five
casinos for counting cards.

00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,108
What's his connection
to Turelli?

00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,577
Tate's a regular
at the Rails.

00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,579
And we know that
he paid for drinks

00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,180
the night that
Turelli died.

00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,649
And the drinks started
flowing at around midnight.

00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,017
Which is exactly the time

00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,587
that Turelli was supposed
to play his big-money game.

00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,623
So I'm guessing maybe it
was against the "snake."

00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,032
Nice place.

00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,734
The hustling doesn't
pay like it used to.

00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,540
LVPD. Open up.

00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:29,709
Officers.

00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,444
Uh, can I help you?

00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,045
We're looking for Cal Tate.

00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,014
I'm sorry.
He's not home.

00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:36,048
And you are...?

00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,050
Zoe Tate, his wife.

00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,285
Okay, then
we'll ask you.

00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,354
Do you know where
Cal was last night?

00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:43,422
I'm sorry,
what's this about?

00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:44,757
It's about Jimmy Turelli.

00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,525
He was murdered.

00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,627
Jimmy's dead?

00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,230
Oh, my God.

00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,398
So, you knew him?

00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:55,101
Oh, a long time ago.
I-I used to wait tables

00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,268
where he bartended.

00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,038
I thought he was in prison.

00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:00,439
Yeah, he got out.

00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,708
MAN (in distance):
Bubbles? Where are you?!

00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,679
And you need to let us in.

00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,483
Come on, Bubbles,

00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,252
fetch me a beer.
Make it snappy this time.

00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,156
Why don't you go
and fetch it yourself?

00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,259
Who the hell are you?

00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,394
LVPD.

00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,064
We got some
questions for you.

00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,098
Well, I'm busy.

00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,667
Nah. Not anymore.

00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:30,670
Were you with Jimmy Turelli

00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,204
last night
at the Rails?

00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,206
You got that right,
cool breeze.

00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,107
Kicked his behind

00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,409
in nine-ball.

00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,577
Won myself a crisp G.

00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,447
Yeah, that guy, he taught me
a lot in the day, but...

00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:42,648
he's lost his touch.

00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,651
Well, we're thinking
you're the one who lost...

00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,453
and did this to him.

00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:48,688
(Tate whistles)

00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,222
That's a bad shave.

00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,691
Did you give it to him?

00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,758
It's not my style.

00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,194
You sure?

00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,562
Positive.

00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,998
Okay, say we
believe you.

00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:02,535
Was Turelli entertaining
any other company last night?

00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,070
He was alone.

00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,639
But I did hear him on the phone
with that Massey broad.

00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,341
Was that Elise Massey, the woman
who runs the tournament?

00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,043
(snaps fingers)
The same.

00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,344
She took over
the management of the Rails

00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:15,314
when Jimmy had his...
incarceration vacation.

00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,016
What were they talking about?
I don't think

00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,018
Jimmy liked what
she'd done to the place.

00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,286
Jimmy always
thought that only

00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:22,421
real pool players
should be allowed.

00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,256
Massey let in
rich wannabes

00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,326
from China, Russia, Dubai.

00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,661
Took you bloody
long enough.

00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,665
Can I get you gentlemen
anything?

00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,033
TATE: These gentlemen
were just leaving,

00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,201
Bubbles.

00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,170
How'd you get
that bruise

00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,472
on your arm, Mrs. Tate?

00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:42,007
Oh, um... I fell.

00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,008
She fell.

00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:49,115
You like slapping women
and old men around, Calvin?

00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,616
I like a lot of things.

00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,353
Right now, what I would like

00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:58,023
is for you to arrest me or...

00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,358
fetch me a beer.

00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,296
Now, what's it gonna be?

00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,268
Neither one, hotshot.

00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,137
Don't leave town.

00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:15,007
(clink)

00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,375
Got something
from the Rails?

00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,044
Yeah, it's about the phone
call that Cal Tate heard.

00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:21,380
I don't think that Massey
and Turelli were fighting

00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,282
over pool players
at the Rails.

00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:27,653
Look at these
credit card receipts.

00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,523
Notice anything odd?

00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:32,591
Five grand for a game of pool?

00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,326
Something else came
with the game.

00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,095
Check out the
Rails' Web site.

00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:39,031
So, when Morgan and Sara
were processing the place,

00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:42,101
they found a notebook
with a security code and

00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,570
a secret password
for the Web site.

00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,006
Membership comes
with its privileges.

00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,075

00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,044

00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,190
Elise Massey.

00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,224
Looks like she
was doing more

00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:07,293
than spicing up the
world of pro billiards.

00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,762
Looks like she turned the Rails
into a brothel.

00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:10,529
I'm thinking

00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,532
that Turelli left prison
wanting to go straight,

00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:16,569

he didn't want to play.

Prostitution in Vegas? Shocking.

00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:37,289
Oh, Vegas or not,
it's still against the law.

00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:38,691
This isn't Nye County.

00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,392
Arrest me, then.

00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,394
With my friends at
the mayor's office

00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,330
and my overpaid
solicitor,

00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,332
I'll be out in five minutes.

00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:50,369
I'm more concerned
with the homicide than hooking.

00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,971
You see,

00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:55,574
we know about your argument
with Jimmy Turelli.

00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,043
Few hours later, he's dead.

00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,079
I didn't kill Jimmy.

00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,547
We had our differences,

00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:05,084
but he always had
my back when...

00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:08,988
when I used to work a little
closer with our clients.

00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:11,090
Are you saying he was your pimp?

00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,691
He was my friend.

00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:17,162
I'll admit his...
moralizing was tiring,

00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,564
but I'd never hurt him.

00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:22,368
Somebody did--
in the club that you ran.

00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,570
Can you account
for your whereabouts last night?

00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:29,408
I was hosting an all-female
trick-shot competition

00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,143
at the Tangiers.

00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,679
Really? Well,
I'll check that out.

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,081
Do. I was there
all night.

00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,684
Astonishing
what those girls can do

00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:42,221
with a few sticks and balls.

00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:52,031
Never seen this
version of pool.

00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:53,499
I invented it myself.

00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,434
Trying to replicate
the blood trail?

00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,269
Mm-hmm.
I still think

00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,271
a pool player
killed Turelli.

00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,106
Maybe Cal Tate.

00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,174
If I can prove
that his cue ball rolled

00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:04,043
through the blood,
and find prints on it,

00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:05,044
we put him away.

00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:07,313
Pool shark
in the corner prison cell.

00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:08,447
Chalk another one up.

00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:19,291
Nice shot.
Thanks.

00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,459
All right,
let's check it out.

00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:31,503
See, I can't seem
to replicate the blood pattern,

00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,172
no matter how many attempts
I make.

00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:34,173
Looks like there
may be, like,

00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:37,376
some kind of crazy
spin on the ball.

00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,377
English?

00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:40,646
I-I don't know.
You're the pool expert.

00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:44,416
I'm no expert, Hodges.
But you used to
play a lot, right?

00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:47,519
Come on.
What's the story?

00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,755
There was a-a dive pool hall
in Venice.

00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:51,156
Real old-school place.

00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,460
Instead of surfing,
I would play nine-ball pool,

00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,462
as my after-school sport.

00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:59,098
It was so real,
you know, the...

00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:02,501
the crazy characters,
the wild games, the hustles.

00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,037
Pool is a lot
like chess, actually.

00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:06,605
A silent game of war.

00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:09,241
You really have to know how
to read a person to win.

00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,577
You ever do a little bit
of hustling yourself?

00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:14,013
Girl's got to make
her beer money somehow, right?

00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,748
Beer money?
Is that all?

00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:17,082
Well, that's all you're getting.

00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,717
(laughs)
I'll tell you one thing.

00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,352
I saw a lot
of really great games

00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,588
when I was playing,
and the real hustlers know

00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:26,291
how to clear a guy out
without the mark even knowing.

00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:27,192
Who's winning?

00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,494
Uh, working.

00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:29,762
Can I help you?

00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:31,563
Well, maybe I can help you.

00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:32,498
Got a hit off of

00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:35,501
the hotel key card
that we found on Turelli's body.

00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:36,969
Not from a hotel.

00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:38,637
It's a condo security card.

00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:39,705
Turelli's condo?

00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,273
Yeah, so I processed the place,

00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:45,411
and I found a few long
female hairs in Turelli's bed.

00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,245
Henry got a hit.

00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:50,082
You got to be kidding me.

00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:54,286
I wasn't having sex
with Jimmy Turelli.

00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:57,022
I was sleeping at his place.
It was an escape.

00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,357
From?

00:25:58,357 --> 00:25:59,725
Cal.

00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,594
Our fights
were getting really bad.

00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,763
Why didn't you just leave?

00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,598
It's complicated.

00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:09,234
Well, it's time to
uncomplicate things, Zoe.

00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,203
Jimmy Turelli was
brutally murdered.

00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:14,006
You pretended not to
have seen him in years.

00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:15,074
Why would you lie about that?

00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:17,709
Hey,

00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:20,145
you need to come clean here.

00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,016
When I first met Cal,

00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:26,652
I knew that he had
a real wild side.

00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:27,686
I liked it.

00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:31,557
I was the straight-A student
that wanted a thrill.

00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:33,625
And I thought
I could tame him,

00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,027
but I became just like him.

00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:37,663
What's that mean exactly?

00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:42,267
A year ago, Cal and I began
working on a scam together.

00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:46,038
An old-fashioned Chicago sting
called the "Honor Hustle."

00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:48,474
The Honor Hustle?

00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:51,009
Cal would find the richest guy
in the bar.

00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,047
<i>I'd flirt with the mark,</i>
<i>mention to him how</i>

00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:57,583
<i>I was unhappy</i>
<i>in my marriage to Cal.</i>

00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:00,486
<i>Cal would end up</i>
<i>playing the mark.</i>

00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:01,653
Nah!

00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:03,455
<i>He'd lose intentionally.</i>

00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,023
<i>Then he'd go in for the kill.</i>

00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,092
Listen, man,
give me one more shot.

00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,360
All right,
for a grand.
No, no, man.

00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,129
Straight up.
Give me my money.

00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:13,665
Actually, you know,
how about this?

00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:16,735
If I lose, you can have Zoe

00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,470
for one night.

00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,073
I'll make her do it.

00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:22,741
You're on.

00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,009
You got it.

00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:38,524
Oh, wait a minute.

00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:40,592
<i>I remember how</i>
<i>to play this game.</i>

00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:41,727
Oh!

00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:45,631
Oh!

00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,169
Did I just win?

00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,370
You bet I did.

00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,005
Yes!

00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:02,181
It was a real rush.

00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,549
CRAWFORD:
Yeah, I bet.

00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:06,752
Ripping off people
is a dangerous game.

00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:10,589
Jimmy thought
we were taking it too far.

00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:12,224
He was worried about me.

00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:14,993
I'm like the daughter
he never had.

00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,095
And it all came
to a head that night.

00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:18,697
Jimmy and Cal weren't playing
for money.

00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,500
"Stakes of a lifetime."

00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,368
I get that now.
That's what Jimmy

00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,470
told Natalie Barrow.

00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,672
Jimmy was playing for you.

00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,176
But Jimmy ran the table
that night,

00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:32,477
and Cal left in a hurry.

00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,246
I have never seen him so upset.

00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:36,281
You think he was
upset enough to kill?

00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,551
I...

00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,086
I don't know.

00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,455
So, you left the
Rails with Jimmy?

00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,457
Uh, we went back
to his place.

00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:48,527
I fell asleep in Jimmy's bed
about 2:00 a.m.

00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:50,462
Woke up at 3:00 a.m., I heard

00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:51,530
Jimmy going out.

00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:54,566
I guess he was going
back to the Rails.

00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,602
I wish I'd stopped him.

00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:59,004
And Where's Cal now?
Do you know?

00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:01,206
I haven't seen him
since the cops came.

00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,587
LVPD. Calvin Tate,
you in there?

00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:28,734
Looks like a hurricane
hit this place.

00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,687
Star-shaped wound.

00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:51,123
Single GSW.

00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,624
Forget the beer.

00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,993
Somebody fetched him
a bullet.

00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:02,567
(siren whooping)

00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,369
Here we go.

00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:06,972
Looks like a nine-mil.

00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,074
Decent rifling impressions.

00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:10,742
How we doing on T.O.D.?

00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:13,645
Liver stick puts that
between 11:00 and 1:00.

00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,414
That's just a few hours ago.

00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:16,114
Yeah.

00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:19,017
All right, thanks, David.

00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,354
All right, so far,
no luck with, uh,

00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:23,422
any of the witnesses.

00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:26,024
Well, it's kind of
convenient

00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:29,428
that Zoe Tate pinned Turelli's
murder on a dead guy.

00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:31,563
Well, I just
checked in with Russell.

00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:35,133
Zoe Tate's been in custody
since 9:00 a.m. this morning.

00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,668
There's no way
she could have done this.

00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,004
Yeah, maybe she
put out a hit.

00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:40,472
I don't know. I mean,
mattress in the bedroom

00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,607
looks like it's been
through a paper-shredder.

00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,543
All right, that says our killer
was looking for something.

00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:47,579
Something Cal Tate hid well.

00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,014
CRAWFORD:
And all the damage says

00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,383
they came up empty-handed.

00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:52,617
SANDERS:
Maybe whatever the killer was

00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:55,220
looking for is still
here somewhere.

00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:58,457
You know, Tate was a hustler.

00:30:58,457 --> 00:30:59,725
Always on the move.

00:30:59,725 --> 00:31:02,527
Guys like him like
to keep their valuables close.

00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,364
Yeah, so if you wanted
to hide something,

00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:08,600
where would you put it to make
it close, but not too close?

00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,007
Inside the lamp?

00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,178
No.

00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:21,413
Inside the hat.

00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:35,193
How's that for close?

00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:39,197
Let's see what Cal Tate's
killer was looking for.

00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,535
That's Zoe Tate.

00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:45,103
Cal's wife.
Yeah, looks
like she's

00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,972
with some Honor
Hustle marks.

00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:48,140
Wait a minute,
I thought the whole point

00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,208
was for her not
to have sex with them.

00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,743
The style of shots indicate

00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,979
a hidden camera--
that says extortion.

00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:57,048
Married man would pay a lot to
stop his wife from seeing those.

00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:00,285
Cal had the photos,
so he had to be in on it.

00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:03,422
Not according to his
bank account. Guy was broke.

00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,290
But hidden camera,
lots of angles--

00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,426
someone had to have
taken those shots.

00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,594
Maybe she had a different
partner for the extortion.

00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:13,198
Cal came across the photos,
wanted a piece of the action.

00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:14,533
Zoe's partner
wasn't interested

00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,735
and made that clear
with a nine-mil.

00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:19,704
So who's the partner?

00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:22,174
RUSSELL:
Zoe Tate lawyered up,

00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:25,110
so if she's part
of an extortion scheme,

00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,079
she's not gonna be diming out
her partner anytime soon.

00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,016
Well, what if we don't
need Zoe Tate at all?

00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:32,184
I've been trying

00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:34,286
to replicate this
blood pattern.

00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,121
At first, I thought
it was made

00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,489
by a billiard ball.

00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:40,425
But it looks like I was
chasing the wrong trick shot.

00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,093
Now, you see
how the ball

00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,529
rolled over the felt,
leaving blood prints

00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:45,697
every couple
of inches?

00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,332
Right, 'cause only
part of the ball

00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,266
went through
the blood.

00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:52,037
A cue ball has a 7.07-inch
circumference,

00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:56,374
so the blood should have left
a cue mark every 7.07 inches.

00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,310
Should?
The distance

00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,545
between the cue marks reduced

00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:03,348
by a hundredth of an
inch every revolution.

00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,083
How's that possible?
(chuckles)

00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,018
You're telling me that
the billiard ball was shrinking?

00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:10,489
Exactly. I can explain.
Now, I also found traces

00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:13,592
of bourbon mixed with
the blood on the felt.

00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:16,061
And I found
this photo

00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:17,662
on the Vegas Rails Web site.

00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,764
Take a look at what's
inside the guy's glass.

00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:22,968
RUSSELL:
Looks like a round piece of ice.

00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:24,736
About the size
of a billiard ball.

00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,005
The blood trail was not
made by a billiard ball.

00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,474
It was made...

00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,243
by an ice ball.

00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:34,479
I made an exemplar, tested
it-- worked every time.

00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,982
<i>I'm thinking the ball</i>
<i>accidentally rolled</i>

00:33:36,982 --> 00:33:39,518
<i>onto the table while</i>
<i>Turelli was being attacked.</i>

00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,487
<i>Under the hot lights,</i>
<i>the ball melted</i>

00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,456
<i>as it rolled down the table.</i>

00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:48,159
<i>When we arrived at the scene,</i>
<i>the ball was completely melted.</i>

00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:51,463
Trick shot of all time.

00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:53,565
But that's not all.

00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:55,500
Turelli was sober.

00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,202
He got sober in prison.

00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,738
Doc confirmed it-- said he had
no alcohol in his system.

00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:03,041
So, the killer was
the only one drinking.

00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,177
You know what I'm thinking?
Yeah.

00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:08,713
Leather pocket absorbed
not only the melted ice

00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,283
but our killer's saliva.

00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:12,751
DNA, corner pocket.

00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:40,679
Did you get
anything?

00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,013
(exhales)

00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:44,616
Results from the, uh...
the ice ball DNA.

00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:46,217
Elise Massey, right?

00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,620
Had a feeling. I could
see pure evil in her eyes.

00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,990
This is an evil
that we did not see.

00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,292
Mary Haymond?
Who the hell is that?

00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,494
It's the woman who hit
Turelli with her car.

00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,263
<i>She gave Turelli</i>
<i>CPR on the scene.</i>

00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:01,733
<i>Greg had to get some DNA from</i>
<i>her for exclusionary reasons.</i>

00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:03,501
It was her
one mistake.

00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,203
The best kind of hustlers
know how to take you

00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:06,538
when you don't even know it.

00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:08,740
Will this take long?

00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,642
I've only got one girl
covering at the salon,

00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:13,345
and she couldn't highlight a
football game, I swear. (laughs)

00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:14,479
Are you done?

00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,348
I'm just saying I'm
kind of busy. I...

00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:18,416
Give it a rest, Ms. Haymond.

00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,518
Let's start
with DeRosa Holdings.

00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:23,521
We recovered bank statements
from your home computer.

00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:27,192
Turns out that you are
president of DeRosa Holdings.

00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:29,628
CRAWFORD:
DeRosa Holdings
owns the Vegas Rails,

00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,529
two Laundromats and three

00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:34,165
beauty salons.
I'm a businesswoman.

00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:35,667
Since when is that a crime?
Well, since they're

00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:39,237
all fronts to launder money
from extortion and prostitution.

00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:42,474
Mary, we found your black book.

00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:45,510
We know that Elise Massey
worked for you

00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,179
and that she was just
the tip of the iceberg.

00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:52,283
I found this photo
on your camera.

00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,118
RUSSELL:
You recruited

00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:56,321
Zoe Tate to extort
all the old rich guys

00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,690
that she and Cal
had been extorting.

00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:03,228
Honor Hustle?
Small-time.

00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:04,295
You're big-time.

00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:07,399
We already questioned Zoe--
she told us everything.

00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:09,000
Uh, the photos
just confirm it.

00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:13,338
I'm no different than
every casino in this town.

00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,539
I take money from

00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:17,575
fools who smile
while they're losing it.

00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,244
And the biggest fools are men.

00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:21,713
A lonely man
is like a blank check.

00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:25,016
I figured that out when I was
dancing at the French Palace.

00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,686
One day, I got tired of giving
half my take to management,

00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:30,221
so I became management.

00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,257
You want to waste
your time blowing up

00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:35,360
everything I worked for?
Fine.

00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,196
But I'm not a killer.

00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,564
There's no money in it.

00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,332
Sure, there is.
I mean,

00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:44,636
that's why you did it.
To protect your scams.

00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:46,104
You think we just believe

00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:48,073
you were out
on a midnight drive,

00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:51,109
just happened to be near
Jimmy Turelli's shallow grave?

00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:53,478
RUSSELL:
Mary, we found
your DNA at the Rails

00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:56,014
mixed in with Turelli's blood.

00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:57,248
Try this one on.

00:36:57,248 --> 00:37:00,085
The bullet that killed
Calvin Tate came from your gun.

00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:03,188
Recovered from your office
at the salon.

00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:09,728
I know a lot of people
in this building.

00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:14,365
This could get very
uncomfortable.

00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,134
Wow.

00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:19,370
You just don't get it, do you?
The hustle is over, Mary.

00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,739
I get why you
killed Calvin.

00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,273
He wanted a piece
of your action.

00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:23,441
You didn't want to give up any.

00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:27,178
But, uh, why Turelli?

00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:31,416
Ah. Everybody in your world
is a sucker.

00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,651
A fool.
Guy makes a change,

00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,453
he wants to try to do
the right thing and, what,

00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,455
you just... you just
wouldn't stand for it?

00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:39,090
Honestly, it
made me sick.

00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,528
After his game with Cal,

00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:47,365
Turelli found the drive with
the photos in Zoe's purse.

00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,167
He assumed she was
in on it with Cal.

00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,303
Guys always call
the shots, right?

00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:55,006
So he confronted Cal.

00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:56,641
Cal plays dumb,
but it was no act.

00:37:56,641 --> 00:38:00,145
He had no idea Zoe was
running a scam with me.

00:38:00,145 --> 00:38:01,112
RUSSELL:
Zoe realizes

00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,313
she's lost the photos.

00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:05,550
She knows that
Turelli's seen them.

00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,485
She gets in touch
with you.

00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,087
Then what?
What happened then?

00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:13,591
I set up a meet with
Turelli back at the Rails.

00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,460
I figured I'd cut him
in on the action.

00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,429
Old-timer deserves a taste.

00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:19,297
But suddenly,

00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,233
he's the one fool in this town
who won't be bought.

00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,404
Take the money.
Don't be stupid.

00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,039
Zoe's a good kid.

00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,040
(scoffs)
She deserves

00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,743
a second chance,
just like I had.

00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:34,679
No, I'm calling the cops.
It's the only way to save her.

00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,514
Now, get out of my club.

00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:40,652
Get out of my club!

00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:43,388
It's not your club
anymore, Jimmy.

00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:46,090
Don't you get it?

00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,325
You're a ghost.

00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,194
Just like those
hustlers on the wall.

00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:54,432
(grunting)

00:38:54,432 --> 00:39:01,739
(groaning, gurgling)

00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:05,210
HAYMOND:
<i>Later, I put Jimmy to bed.</i>

00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:11,482
<i>Took me 20 minutes</i>
<i>to get back to the main road.</i>

00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:14,252
<i>Guess Jimmy</i>
<i>wasn't finished dying.</i>

00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:16,221
Son of a bitch.

00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:21,025
(tires screech)

00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,294
When it's your time,

00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,063
it's your time.

00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:27,265
I couldn't have
said that better myself.

00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,578
You know, it's funny,
but I thought

00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:43,281
Zoe Tate lawyered up.

00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:44,182
Yeah, she did.

00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:49,354
So she never said a word about
her and Mary working together?

00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:51,389
No. No, not a word.

00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,590
You're telling me that you

00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,693
lied to a suspect
in interrogation?

00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,328
Best kind of hustle.

00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:04,202
(door opens)

00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:05,203
Hey, Hodges.

00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:07,572
Come on, let's get a game in
before they take this thing.

00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,540
Uh, I would prefer
to hang on

00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,976
to what little
dignity I have left.

00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,578
Come on.
We'll make it interesting.

00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,980
I'll play left-handed and...

00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:19,484
loser has to clean
the GCMS for a month.

00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:21,319
Okay, now you're just
hustling me.

00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:23,288
Okay.
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa,

00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:25,056
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:26,124
Left-handed?

00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:28,326
Yeah. And I'll even
let you break.

00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,331
Okay.

00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:35,767
If it'll make
you happy.

00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:38,336
Let's do it.

00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,388
Well, that was lucky.

00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:59,557
Yeah. Lucky.
