00:00:01,002 --> 00:00:04,308
<i>Previously on</i> CSI:
FINLAY: <i>Jared Briscoe,</i>
<i>the Gig Harbor Killer.</i>

00:00:04,308 --> 00:00:08,582
<i>Murdered seven women.</i>
TURNER: <i>A man's been</i>
<i>wrongfully imprisoned.</i>

00:00:08,582 --> 00:00:11,220
SHAW: <i>Who knew that psychopath</i>
<i>Briscoe had a twin?</i>

00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,157
RUSSELL: <i>Do you think the</i>
<i>brothers were working together?</i>

00:00:13,157 --> 00:00:14,393
My brother Jared
is going to have

00:00:14,393 --> 00:00:15,662
<i>a new day in court.</i>
We're investigating

00:00:15,662 --> 00:00:20,004
<i>the disappearance</i>
<i>of my partner, Keri Torres.</i>

00:00:20,004 --> 00:00:21,673
RUSSELL: <i>Maya.</i>
When I was little,

00:00:21,673 --> 00:00:25,280
you always made me feel so safe.
RYAN: <i>D.B., if you're</i>

00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,351
not willing to put Maya
into play in

00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:30,289
some kind of a way...
The greater good.

00:00:30,422 --> 00:00:32,326
<i>Keri's gonna make it.</i>

00:00:34,162 --> 00:00:35,732
NURSE:
Sir, you can't be here.

00:00:35,732 --> 00:00:37,468
You've been a bad boy.

00:00:39,104 --> 00:00:39,739
Get in.

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,386
(muffled breathing)

00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:19,679
Hello, Maya.

00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:23,753
It's been a long time--
remember me?

00:01:34,139 --> 00:01:35,641
Please, don't.

00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:36,710
Shh.

00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:41,152
My brother once taught me--

00:01:41,152 --> 00:01:42,821
a long time ago-- he said,

00:01:42,821 --> 00:01:45,225
"If you love someone...

00:01:46,494 --> 00:01:48,331
...set them free."

00:01:51,103 --> 00:01:52,072
Aah!

00:01:52,205 --> 00:01:54,710
I could never

00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,445
hurt you.

00:01:58,383 --> 00:01:59,685
I love you.

00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:07,734
Aren't you gonna run, hmm?
(kissing)
(whimpering)

00:02:07,734 --> 00:02:10,638
Come on. Yeah, like that.

00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,442
Oh!
(cackling)

00:02:15,314 --> 00:02:17,218
You're so beautiful like this.

00:02:17,218 --> 00:02:18,754
I can do this all night.

00:02:18,754 --> 00:02:19,756
Oh!

00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:26,300
No, no, no, no, you
don't want to do that.

00:02:31,343 --> 00:02:32,713
(screams)

00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:33,747
(gasps)

00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:45,135
MAYA: <i>Look, Dad, I don't want</i>
<i>to argue with you about this.</i>

00:02:45,135 --> 00:02:48,307
I just want to go home.
Back to Seattle.

00:02:48,307 --> 00:02:50,779
Hey, come on, we've
talked about this before, honey.

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,782
With everything
that's going on--

00:02:52,782 --> 00:02:54,786
Gig Harbor all over again.

00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:57,157
Look, you said yourself
you don't feel safe.

00:02:57,157 --> 00:02:59,728
Well, it's easier for me
to keep you safe here.

00:02:59,728 --> 00:03:01,799
I know what I said,
but that's because

00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:03,769
I was alone and scared.

00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:06,541
But Ryan's getting back
from London, and

00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,413
Katie's coming home
from his folks' ranch.

00:03:09,413 --> 00:03:11,517
Dad, I appreciate
everything you've done.

00:03:11,517 --> 00:03:13,520
OFFICER:
Control, One-David-42,
all clear.

00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,524
CONTROL:
Roger that, David-42.

00:03:15,524 --> 00:03:17,628
I know you just
want to protect me, but...

00:03:18,563 --> 00:03:20,666
I've got to get back to my life.

00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,570
All right, I'm sorry,
you're right, you're right.

00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,141
It's what fathers do:
We worry, right?

00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:26,577
And I love you for it.

00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:29,583
I booked a flight.

00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,720
Tonight.
I have a taxi picking me up.

00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,790
No, no, I'll drive you
there myself.

00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,761
But you said you have
that meeting with the sheriff.

00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:36,863
Dad, it's fine.

00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:38,933
All right, okay,
but no-no... no taxis.

00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:42,707
I'll, um... I'll have
Detective Crawford pick you up.

00:03:42,707 --> 00:03:45,779
No arguments. You hear me?

00:03:45,779 --> 00:03:47,448
I hear you.

00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:49,352
I love you, Dad.

00:03:49,352 --> 00:03:50,554
I love you, too.

00:03:50,554 --> 00:03:52,190
MAYA:
I'll call you from Seattle.

00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,428
RUSSELL:
No, no, no, hey--
you will call me

00:03:54,428 --> 00:03:56,432
when you get
to the airport here,

00:03:56,432 --> 00:03:57,901
and then you will call me
from Seattle.

00:03:57,901 --> 00:04:00,907
MAYA:
Okay, now you need to stop
being a worrywart.

00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,576
RUSSELL:
Not gonna happen.

00:04:03,412 --> 00:04:04,580
MAYA:
Bye.

00:04:04,814 --> 00:04:05,649
RUSSELL:
Bye.

00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:09,556

Thank you.
Yeah.

00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:13,339
You look good, Jared.
Today's the big day.

00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:16,779
I don't understand...

00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:17,780
any of this.

00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,784
The judge reviewed
the evidence.

00:05:19,784 --> 00:05:21,655
Nothing ties you
forensically to the murders.

00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,026
He's thrown out your confession.
You're gonna be a free man.

00:05:24,026 --> 00:05:25,795
You're not
listening to me.

00:05:25,795 --> 00:05:28,733
Why am I here?

00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:30,002
Jared, you listen to me.

00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:32,006
This was not the plan.

00:05:32,006 --> 00:05:34,544
You said, if I make a
sacrifice, in return,

00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:36,615
I would live forever.

00:05:36,615 --> 00:05:38,853
Ah, yeah.

00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:42,359
Plans change.

00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:43,628
Why?

00:05:43,628 --> 00:05:45,364
I need you.

00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:46,633
You need me.

00:05:46,633 --> 00:05:47,802
Don't you miss what we had?

00:05:47,802 --> 00:05:49,004
Of course I do.

00:05:49,004 --> 00:05:51,375
So I say we can have it again.

00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:55,416
And this time, I promise you,
it'll be so much better.

00:05:55,884 --> 00:05:57,586
And why should I trust you?

00:05:57,586 --> 00:06:00,492
How can you say that?
Look at me. Look in my eyes.

00:06:00,492 --> 00:06:01,628
My eyes are
your eyes.

00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:03,464
My heart is your heart.

00:06:07,304 --> 00:06:10,277
When is it happening?

00:06:10,277 --> 00:06:11,445
If all goes according
to plan, you'll be

00:06:11,445 --> 00:06:13,516
a free man in a few hours.

00:06:13,516 --> 00:06:14,785
And we'll celebrate.

00:06:14,785 --> 00:06:17,290
In Vegas.

00:06:17,456 --> 00:06:19,961
I'll even have
a little gift for you.

00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:23,534
Something you've been dreaming
about for a very long time.

00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:25,638
<i>I stand before you today</i>
<i>a man fulfilled.</i>

00:06:25,638 --> 00:06:29,478
A man whose prayers
have been answered.

00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:32,650
Because today, after four
long years of incarceration,

00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,489
my brother Jared Briscoe
is a free man.

00:06:35,489 --> 00:06:38,595
But Jared will not truly be free

00:06:38,595 --> 00:06:40,532
until those who have
wrongfully imprisoned him

00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:41,934
are brought to account, and

00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:45,007
I will not rest
until I've made them pay.

00:06:45,007 --> 00:06:47,010
(reporters clamoring)

00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,379
(TV clicks off)

00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:49,648
I don't believe this.

00:06:49,648 --> 00:06:51,485
I heard Winthrop's
gonna sue Seattle PD.

00:06:51,485 --> 00:06:53,689
I'm waiting to be served
myself, any day.

00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:55,659
D.B., we cannot
let this stand.

00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:59,467
What are we gonna do?
We're dead in the water here.

00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:01,069
Keri Torres may be
out of the hospital;

00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:03,073
she can't remember a thing
about who kidnapped her.

00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:04,909
Hodges is working on something.

00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:07,381
That's news to me.
Well, you know how he is.

00:07:07,381 --> 00:07:09,485
What does he have?
All he would tell me is

00:07:09,485 --> 00:07:10,820
that the strings
from the crime scenes

00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,456
are starting
to sing to him.

00:07:12,456 --> 00:07:13,659
That's very helpful.

00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:15,529
Russell.
Yeah?

00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:17,633
We're all set.
I'll pick up Maya at 7:00,

00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:18,802
take her to the airport.

00:07:18,802 --> 00:07:19,736
Thank you.

00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:21,740
Maya's leaving?

00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,678
Yeah, she's, uh,
she's going back home.

00:07:23,678 --> 00:07:26,382
Up to Seattle.
CRAWFORD: For what it's worth,
it was a good idea.

00:07:26,382 --> 00:07:28,486
Yeah, I got to say
I'm surprised that Winthrop

00:07:28,486 --> 00:07:29,755
didn't try to make
a move, though.

00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:32,827
I thought that Maya
was down here visiting.

00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,896
She was.

00:07:33,896 --> 00:07:35,365
Wait a minute.

00:07:35,365 --> 00:07:37,937
You took Avery Ryan's advice?

00:07:37,937 --> 00:07:42,712
Does Maya know that she
was down here as bait?

00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:43,447
CRAWFORD: In case
you wanted to know,

00:07:43,447 --> 00:07:45,384
we had her under
surveillance 24-7.

00:07:45,384 --> 00:07:46,920
I'd hardly call that bait.

00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,356
Really?

00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:49,925
And what would you call it?

00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,465
The greater good.

00:07:56,971 --> 00:08:12,566
(violin playing out of tune)

00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:13,835
You cannot be serious.

00:08:13,835 --> 00:08:14,871
Never had one lesson.

00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:16,473
Shocking.

00:08:16,473 --> 00:08:18,611
And this stuff
isn't too pleasant, either.

00:08:18,611 --> 00:08:22,685
HODGES: And yet it makes
such beautiful music.

00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:24,155
You're replicating the
process that the killer used

00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:25,824
to make the strings
for the crime scene.

00:08:25,824 --> 00:08:27,828
The process, yes.
The material, no.

00:08:27,828 --> 00:08:31,501
Oh, well, so good to know you're
not using real human tissue.

00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:34,139
Although I haven't seen
Henry around lately.
(laughs)

00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,910
Very funny.

00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,979
You are looking at catgut.

00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:39,783
Interesting fact one: Catgut

00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:42,822
is used not just to produce
strings for instruments,

00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:45,627
but also strings for tennis
rackets as well as sutures.

00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:47,630
Interesting fact two: Catgut

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,170
isn't cat gut.
It's usually sheep or goat...

00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,473
Interesting fact three
is the part where

00:08:52,473 --> 00:08:53,575
this has something
to do with anything.

00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,547
String manufacture like this

00:08:56,547 --> 00:08:58,016
is extremely hard to do.

00:08:58,016 --> 00:09:02,090
At least at the level of
competence shown by our killer.

00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,994
Meaning what?
Meaning either our

00:09:03,994 --> 00:09:07,099
killer was an expert, which
doesn't fit Paul Winthrop's

00:09:07,099 --> 00:09:09,203
résumé, or our killer

00:09:09,203 --> 00:09:12,643
recruited an expert and forced
that person to do his stringing.

00:09:12,643 --> 00:09:14,480
Evidence suggests the latter.

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,916
It suggests more than that.

00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:18,787
Did the research.

00:09:18,787 --> 00:09:21,860
There are half a dozen experts
in the art of string craft

00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,796
west of the Mississippi.

00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,165
One of them is in Vegas.

00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,802
That face look familiar to you?

00:09:26,802 --> 00:09:28,238
That's the woman

00:09:28,238 --> 00:09:29,741
that the killer
held at The Mizu.

00:09:29,741 --> 00:09:30,876
The one that Finlay shot.

00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:33,681
Aah! Aah! Di...

00:09:33,681 --> 00:09:36,787
She was never I.D.'d. No one
ever reported her missing.

00:09:36,787 --> 00:09:40,494
Huh. And now, thanks to this,
we have her address.

00:09:40,494 --> 00:09:41,996
Mm-hmm.

00:09:41,996 --> 00:09:43,132
You want to go along?

00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:44,501
Get a little fresh air?

00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,672
For you? Yes.

00:09:54,587 --> 00:09:56,122
The lock is busted.

00:09:56,122 --> 00:09:57,224
Somebody
broke in.

00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,497
Oh, oh, boy.

00:10:00,497 --> 00:10:02,768
You promised me fresh air.

00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,840
Is that, uh...
Yeah, it's exactly
what you think it is.

00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:07,176
All right, wait
here, all right?

00:10:07,176 --> 00:10:09,947
Whoa, whoa, hey,
d-don't you need backup?

00:10:09,947 --> 00:10:11,484
Don't you
need a gun?

00:10:11,484 --> 00:10:14,122
Seriously, just stay here
while I clear the place.

00:10:14,122 --> 00:10:15,658
Copy that.

00:10:33,824 --> 00:10:34,926
(creaking)

00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,597
Whew.

00:10:50,088 --> 00:10:51,757
The house is clear!

00:10:51,757 --> 00:10:53,528
Got a body, though.

00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:57,134
Woman.

00:10:57,134 --> 00:10:58,770
She's been here
for a while.

00:11:02,711 --> 00:11:03,134
(exhales)

00:11:03,134 --> 00:11:04,881
Someone enjoys reading
about himself.

00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:09,790
Looks like our killer
has been camping out

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,728
in Rebecca Lowell's house.

00:11:11,728 --> 00:11:12,996
HODGES:
Bad deal for her.

00:11:12,996 --> 00:11:16,870
Enslaved to make his strings,
then he squats in her digs.

00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,606
Any idea
who the dead woman was?

00:11:18,606 --> 00:11:21,010
No, but hopefully
we'll get an I.D.

00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,750
You know, this place seems a
little down-rent for a guy like

00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,219
Paul Winthrop to squat in.

00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:26,855
HODGES:
We have assumed that he's been

00:11:26,855 --> 00:11:29,226
working with a partner
since he's been in Vegas, right?

00:11:29,226 --> 00:11:30,929
Yeah.
So...

00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:32,732
maybe it's more
<i>his</i> style.

00:11:36,874 --> 00:11:38,777
Ants.

00:11:38,777 --> 00:11:39,879
I hate ants.

00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:44,621
(hissing)

00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,658
How do you feel
about body parts?

00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,166
(sighs)

00:11:54,806 --> 00:11:57,945
MAN:
All units. All units.
We have a 444. Shots fired.

00:11:57,945 --> 00:12:00,082
Officer needs assistance.
Corner of Highland and Branch.

00:12:00,082 --> 00:12:02,887
Code 3.
Control, this is One-David-42.

00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:04,858
Currently two blocks
from that location.

00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,194
We are responding

00:12:06,194 --> 00:12:09,199
but will require backup
at 923 Altos Drive.

00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:11,369
(siren wailing)

00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:19,251
(knocks)

00:12:21,755 --> 00:12:24,327
Hi there. You requested a ride
to the airport?

00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,232
I-I thought Detective Crawford
was gonna take me.

00:12:27,232 --> 00:12:29,603
Yeah, he got called away.
I'm Detective Shaw.

00:12:29,603 --> 00:12:32,040
I promise I'm just
as safe a driver.

00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:34,712
Don't I know you?

00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:38,185
Yeah. I used to work in Seattle
with your dad.

00:12:38,185 --> 00:12:39,889
He just thought

00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:42,026
a familiar face might make you
feel a little more comfortable.

00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:43,695
You're here a little early.

00:12:43,695 --> 00:12:44,898
Yeah, I know.
I probably should have called,

00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:47,202
but there's a pileup
on the I-15.

00:12:47,202 --> 00:12:48,838
Oh. Well, okay.

00:12:48,838 --> 00:12:50,875
Um, better safe than sorry.

00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,880
Can I get your bag?
Mm-hmm.

00:12:55,884 --> 00:12:57,922
Hey. Got your text.

00:12:57,922 --> 00:13:00,793
You have something on the
bodies Morgan and Hodges found?

00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:02,062
Not all of them.

00:13:02,062 --> 00:13:04,333
This poor woman
remains unidentified.

00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:06,671
But according to DNA,

00:13:06,671 --> 00:13:10,411
these body parts
came from Emily Bartson

00:13:10,411 --> 00:13:12,147
and Pamela Kramer.
Two missing girls

00:13:12,147 --> 00:13:13,282
here in Vegas.

00:13:13,282 --> 00:13:14,752
PHILLIPS:
After all these weeks,

00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,753
we found 'em.

00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:16,822
That's not all we found.

00:13:16,822 --> 00:13:18,926
Finn, you're gonna want
to see this.

00:13:18,926 --> 00:13:20,262
We recovered
partial prints

00:13:20,262 --> 00:13:22,299
from Rebecca Lowell's house.
In the kitchen,

00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:24,904
in the living room,
in the bedroom. Everywhere.

00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,808
The prints came back
to Daniel Shaw.

00:13:26,808 --> 00:13:29,079
He's been there.

00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:30,348
Staying there.

00:13:30,348 --> 00:13:32,719
Shaw is Winthrop's partner.

00:13:43,972 --> 00:13:46,010
So, you worked with my dad
in Seattle?

00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,679
That's right.
Then you must know

00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:48,881
Julie Finlay, too.

00:13:48,881 --> 00:13:50,818
Yeah, I do.

00:13:50,818 --> 00:13:52,921
How long you been in Vegas?

00:13:52,921 --> 00:13:55,226
Not long.
My dad drag you

00:13:55,226 --> 00:13:56,728
down here, like Finn?

00:13:58,365 --> 00:14:01,437
Yeah. Yeah, I guess
you might say that.

00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,847
It's funny. My dad talks
about Finn all the time.

00:14:08,283 --> 00:14:11,255
He's never mentioned you.

00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:14,227
I guess we're just not as close.

00:14:23,711 --> 00:14:26,917
I think, uh,
you missed the turn.

00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:28,253
Airport's back
that way.

00:14:28,253 --> 00:14:29,823
I'm going another way.

00:14:33,396 --> 00:14:35,433
You're not taking me
to the airport, are you?

00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:40,174
No.

00:14:49,325 --> 00:14:52,931
I don't know, Conrad.
The situation's fluid right now.

00:14:52,931 --> 00:14:55,336
Yeah. My house is a crime scene.

00:14:55,336 --> 00:14:57,340
They're processing it right now.

00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:01,413
And as for Maya,
I have every available unit on.

00:15:01,413 --> 00:15:04,252
I know. I know. Thank you.

00:15:04,252 --> 00:15:05,487
I hope so, too.

00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:10,096
D.B., I heard about Maya.
What happened?

00:15:10,096 --> 00:15:15,138
Surveillance team was pulled
off by a false 444 call.

00:15:15,138 --> 00:15:17,276
Somebody slipped in before
Crawford could get there.

00:15:17,276 --> 00:15:19,847
We found Shaw's fingerprints
at the house with the bodies.

00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:20,982
Yeah, well, I'm
not surprised.

00:15:20,982 --> 00:15:22,351
What do you mean?

00:15:22,986 --> 00:15:25,457
Keep walking with
me for a minute.

00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,797
MAN:
This is One-David-30.
Crossing Bartlet.

00:15:28,797 --> 00:15:30,333
Proceeding northbound.

00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,904
MAN 2:
One-David-One. Crossing Temple.
We still got a visual

00:15:32,904 --> 00:15:34,908
on the suspect vehicle?
Copy that, One-David-Ten.

00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:37,479
All units, be advised, suspect
vehicle is continuing north

00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,450
on Everly Boulevard.

00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,320
MAYA:
Where are you taking me?

00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,459
SHAW:
It's probably best
if we don't talk.

00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:46,295
MAYA:
We have to talk.

00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:47,197
SHAW:
No, we don't.

00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,437
I can't believe
you let this happen.

00:15:50,437 --> 00:15:52,874
Like I said, we had
surveillance 24-7.

00:15:52,874 --> 00:15:54,444
For the greater good?

00:15:55,346 --> 00:15:57,516
Maya agreed to wear the wire.

00:15:57,516 --> 00:15:59,319
She wants to put
these guys away.

00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:00,888
For all of those women.

00:16:00,888 --> 00:16:01,924
And for herself, too.

00:16:01,924 --> 00:16:03,193
She wants to end the nightmares.

00:16:03,193 --> 00:16:05,163
Well, you're playing
a very dangerous game.

00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:07,301
It's not a game at all.
We know Winthrop's M.O.

00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:09,471
Shaw is not going to hurt Maya.

00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,241
Not at least until
he delivers her to Winthrop.

00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:13,545
And we'll have eyes on
the whole time.

00:16:13,545 --> 00:16:15,048
Winthrop shows up,
we take 'em out.

00:16:15,048 --> 00:16:16,918
Who else knows about this?

00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:17,886
Present company, Ecklie,

00:16:17,886 --> 00:16:20,291
and Nick and Greg
are in the follow car.

00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,894
CRAWFORD:
Along with eight support units.

00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:23,230
Operation like this,
the fewer people

00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,265
that know about it,
the better.

00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,302
STOKES:
Charlie-04-Stokes.
We've got eyes on

00:16:26,302 --> 00:16:27,938
and are hanging back.

00:16:27,938 --> 00:16:30,310
CRAWFORD:
<i>What are you guys seeing</i>
<i>out there, Nick?</i>

00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,812
STOKES:
<i>Not much.</i>

00:16:31,812 --> 00:16:33,148
Looks like this
guy's just out

00:16:33,148 --> 00:16:34,951
for a Sunday drive.

00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:37,121
I don't think we've been made.
He hasn't tried to shake us.

00:16:38,825 --> 00:16:40,294
Let me talk to you for a sec.

00:16:40,294 --> 00:16:42,097
Look, you don't agree
with what I'm doing.

00:16:42,097 --> 00:16:43,199
That goes without saying.

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,103
Something is
really bothering me.

00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:47,841
Tell me. I want to know.

00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,914
I know what the evidence says,
and I know what this looks like,

00:16:50,914 --> 00:16:52,817
but something
is not adding up.

00:16:52,817 --> 00:16:54,554
I need to see the evidence
in Rebecca Lowell's house

00:16:54,554 --> 00:16:55,589
for myself.

00:17:04,438 --> 00:17:06,409
(door opens)

00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:08,145
Hey.
Hey, David.

00:17:08,145 --> 00:17:10,950
You get an I.D.
on the woman I found in the bed?

00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,620
No name. Not yet.

00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,958
But DNA came back.
The dead woman

00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,994
was Rebecca Lowell's sister.

00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,564
What was her C.O.D.?

00:17:18,564 --> 00:17:20,434
A broken hyoid bone.

00:17:20,434 --> 00:17:23,507
Suggests asphyxiation
due to manual strangulation.

00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:25,410
That's inconsistent
with our killer's M.O.

00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,414
So far, in Gig Harbor
and Vegas,

00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:30,453
the women were beaten
and stabbed.

00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:32,623
Looks like you got
a whole larvae farm there.

00:17:32,623 --> 00:17:33,992
I know. And it's weird.

00:17:33,992 --> 00:17:36,631
I found two distinct sets
of first instar larvae.

00:17:36,631 --> 00:17:40,271
The white are blowflies,
and the brown are beetles.

00:17:40,271 --> 00:17:42,875
The beetle and the blowfly
are natural enemies.

00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,211
And natural enemies
suggests

00:17:44,211 --> 00:17:47,049
to me that the eggs weren't laid
at the same time.

00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:50,289
Put that together with the fact
that neither insect developed

00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:52,259
past first instar,

00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:54,964
and I think we're looking
at a sequence of events here.

00:17:54,964 --> 00:17:56,900
So you're thinking that
these bodies were moved.

00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,936
Multiple times.

00:17:57,936 --> 00:18:00,207
(buzzing)
<i>Frozen and refrozen.</i>

00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:02,077
<i>Blowflies laid their eggs,</i>

00:18:02,077 --> 00:18:04,248
<i>the larvae froze to death,</i>

00:18:04,248 --> 00:18:06,586
<i>and then in a different place</i>
<i>and time,</i>

00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,324
<i>the beetles had their chance.</i>

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,664
If I can identify these species,
isolate them

00:18:13,664 --> 00:18:16,002
to a specific habitat,

00:18:16,002 --> 00:18:18,273
it might give us a map
to the killer's movements.

00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,154
SANDERS:
We just turned onto Corvell.
RUSSELL: Where the hell

00:18:26,154 --> 00:18:28,291
is he going?
I don't know.
I don't get it.

00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,462
All right, hold on.
He's turning down an alley.

00:18:41,382 --> 00:18:42,350
The car's stopped.

00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,290
It's just sitting there.

00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,328
Why are we stopping here?

00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:50,332
Don't run.

00:18:59,615 --> 00:19:01,953
He's making a call.

00:19:01,953 --> 00:19:04,290
I can't hear anything.

00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,129
(sighs)

00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:10,501
I'm scared, Dad.

00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:11,704
I keep thinking...

00:19:13,574 --> 00:19:14,643
what would you do?

00:19:15,712 --> 00:19:17,581
I know that's what's
gonna get me through this.

00:19:19,051 --> 00:19:20,220
(shuddering exhale)

00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,054
Love you, Dad.

00:19:23,158 --> 00:19:24,427
I love you, too.

00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:34,178
That person on the other end
of the line,

00:19:34,178 --> 00:19:35,614
is that why you're doing this?

00:19:35,614 --> 00:19:37,083
What do you want from me?

00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,520
I just want the truth.

00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,523
If I'm gonna die,

00:19:40,523 --> 00:19:42,994
I think I at least deserve
that much.

00:19:42,994 --> 00:19:45,465
You think that's gonna make it
any easier?

00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,207
(starts engine)

00:19:57,622 --> 00:20:09,176
(dog barking in distance)

00:20:09,176 --> 00:20:10,611
(floorboard creaks)

00:20:10,611 --> 00:20:11,613
(gasps)

00:20:11,613 --> 00:20:12,749
Hodges.

00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:14,619
What are you doing here?

00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:16,622
Well, Morgan told me to stay,
collect evidence.

00:20:16,622 --> 00:20:19,562
In the dark?
You ever heard of work lights?

00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:22,500
My mentor, Grissom,
taught me to see the scene

00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,370
as the killer saw it.
That's great.

00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,040
But I would prefer work lights.

00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,442
Sorry.

00:20:27,442 --> 00:20:29,713
It's not my fault that
these floors are old and creaky.

00:20:29,713 --> 00:20:30,648
What are you doing here anyway?

00:20:30,648 --> 00:20:32,719
You found Shaw's
prints here, right?

00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:35,691
Everywhere.
Everywhere?

00:20:36,426 --> 00:20:38,997
On the clippings,
the work table

00:20:38,997 --> 00:20:40,233
and the freezer?
Well, no,

00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:41,635
not there, exactly.

00:20:41,635 --> 00:20:43,639
I just suspect that when
he wasn't lounging around,

00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:47,679
he was in serial killer mode
and... wore gloves.

00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,484
Um, far be it

00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:53,022
from me to listen
to office gossip,

00:20:53,022 --> 00:20:55,026
but I understand
that you and Shaw were close...

00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:56,529
Hodges.
I-I'm sorry.

00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:58,332
Boundaries. I get it.

00:20:58,733 --> 00:21:00,202
Did you move this table?

00:21:00,202 --> 00:21:02,640
Ah, well, my mentor...

00:21:02,774 --> 00:21:04,644
The answer would be "no."

00:21:04,644 --> 00:21:06,313
Somebody moved the table.

00:21:06,313 --> 00:21:08,184
Want to give me a hand?
Sure.

00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,154
(squeaking)

00:21:11,456 --> 00:21:12,725
(creaking)

00:21:12,725 --> 00:21:14,528
See what I mean
about the floors?

00:21:22,042 --> 00:21:23,412
Look at that.

00:21:24,146 --> 00:21:26,584
(camera shutter clicking)

00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,758
And that is why you're a CSI.

00:21:36,501 --> 00:21:38,239
(whirring)

00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:56,739
(computer clicking softly)

00:21:56,739 --> 00:21:59,110
(computer chirping)

00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,579
Ran the partials
from the strongbox.

00:22:00,579 --> 00:22:02,416
They came back
to our homeowner

00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:05,154
and string maker,
Rebecca Lowell.

00:22:05,154 --> 00:22:06,490
I don't think

00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,694
she was just making money
from making strings.

00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,464
Did you find something
on the flash drive?

00:22:10,464 --> 00:22:12,434
Files from an escort service.

00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:14,605
Lady Aquarius Escorts,
to be exact.

00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:16,375
All of our victims

00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,844
are involved
in the sex trade,

00:22:17,844 --> 00:22:20,082
but we never knew
how they were connected,

00:22:20,082 --> 00:22:21,551
or who was pimping them out.

00:22:21,551 --> 00:22:23,855
They were all working
for Rebecca Lowell?

00:22:23,855 --> 00:22:25,191
File says yes.

00:22:26,393 --> 00:22:28,096
Those are the names
of all our victims.

00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,800
And there's quite
a client list, too.

00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,771
Lots of prominent men,
including Paul Winthrop.

00:22:32,771 --> 00:22:34,642
Talk about a smoking gun.

00:22:34,642 --> 00:22:36,745
For solicitation,
not for murder.
Hmm.

00:22:36,745 --> 00:22:39,183
I was looking at the receipts.

00:22:39,183 --> 00:22:41,253
We are talking a lot of money.

00:22:41,253 --> 00:22:43,758
Well, it's not surprising
given the clientele.

00:22:43,758 --> 00:22:45,260
What is the
difference between

00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,597
a client and a friend?

00:22:46,597 --> 00:22:48,567
Is it a price point?
I don't know.

00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:49,902
I was just getting there.

00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,275
Those are cops

00:22:53,275 --> 00:22:56,548
and judges from Las Vegas
and from Seattle.

00:22:56,548 --> 00:22:58,518
Money says bribes,
protection.

00:22:58,518 --> 00:23:00,856
Mm-hmm.

00:23:01,357 --> 00:23:04,229
Shaw's on the list.

00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:05,398
I don't believe it.

00:23:05,398 --> 00:23:06,533
Cop on the take.

00:23:06,533 --> 00:23:07,902
This connects him to Winthrop.

00:23:15,617 --> 00:23:18,655
I have a daughter--
Kaitlyn.

00:23:18,655 --> 00:23:20,526
She comes home
from her grandparents' tomorrow.

00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:24,800
Your dad taught you well.

00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,705
How to humanize yourself
in the eyes of a killer.

00:23:27,705 --> 00:23:29,708
Do you have kids?

00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,548
What does it matter?

00:23:32,548 --> 00:23:34,517
MAYA:
Do you?

00:23:34,517 --> 00:23:37,323
It's not going to work.

00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:41,397
Then just tell me this.

00:23:41,397 --> 00:23:43,701
Why me?

00:23:43,701 --> 00:23:46,406
I know enough
about those other girls

00:23:46,406 --> 00:23:47,808
to know that I'm not like them.

00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:51,648
You're nothing like them.

00:23:51,648 --> 00:23:54,454
Then why?

00:23:54,454 --> 00:23:56,525
Is it because of my dad?

00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:59,597
It's not just that.

00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:06,610
CRAWFORD:
Okay, he's making another turn.

00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,647
It's like
he keeps going in a circle.

00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,750
No, he's going back
to the airport.

00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,487
Winthrop got
his brother released

00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:13,689
sometime this afternoon, right?

00:24:13,689 --> 00:24:15,292
What time did they fly out
of Seattle?

00:24:15,292 --> 00:24:16,561
We have that
information, right?

00:24:18,265 --> 00:24:21,403
Winthrop's private jet took off
from Seattle four hours ago.

00:24:21,403 --> 00:24:22,605
That means
they've already landed.

00:24:22,605 --> 00:24:24,241
Guys, I think this is happening.

00:24:24,241 --> 00:24:26,412
The meet's going down
with Winthrop somewhere around

00:24:26,412 --> 00:24:29,818
the Executive Terminal
at the airport.

00:24:47,284 --> 00:24:50,690
He's going into a garage
under an industrial building.

00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,560
1017 Parkman Way.

00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,296
Pull up that location.

00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:00,775
That's Winthrop's building.

00:25:00,775 --> 00:25:04,315
There's only one way in
and one way out of this garage.

00:25:04,315 --> 00:25:07,722
We go in, we're
gonna get made.

00:25:07,722 --> 00:25:09,324
What do you want to do?

00:25:11,862 --> 00:25:14,000
Let's stick with the plan.

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,569
We wait for Winthrop.

00:25:26,822 --> 00:25:28,726
What is this place?

00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,533
Is this where
it's gonna happen?

00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:34,537
Quiet.

00:25:34,537 --> 00:25:36,040
Just listen.

00:25:38,344 --> 00:25:44,689
(classical music playing)

00:25:44,689 --> 00:25:47,360
I went to a recital once.

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,599
Music like this. Strings.

00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:54,874
There was a young girl
playing the violin.

00:25:55,675 --> 00:25:57,779
It was beautiful.

00:25:57,779 --> 00:25:59,282
<i>She</i> was beautiful.

00:25:59,282 --> 00:26:02,455
I couldn't believe that
something so beautiful...

00:26:02,455 --> 00:26:03,757
could be mine.

00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:12,706
But at the same time,
I knew I didn't deserve her.

00:26:12,706 --> 00:26:15,679
'Cause everything I touch,
I destroy.

00:26:16,781 --> 00:26:19,652
Because men like me are weak.

00:26:19,652 --> 00:26:22,391
Because of that weakness,
they commit crimes.

00:26:22,391 --> 00:26:23,727
They commit sins.

00:26:23,727 --> 00:26:26,365
Sins for which
there is no going back.

00:26:27,032 --> 00:26:29,604
She doesn't say anything.

00:26:29,604 --> 00:26:31,775
Why isn't she saying anything?

00:26:31,775 --> 00:26:32,843
There-there's
something wrong. Damn it!

00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:34,079
Guys, go in now!

00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:36,417
All units, converge now!

00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,860
SHAW:
I want you to understand,
I need you to understand,

00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,398
I didn't want this.

00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:47,503
I didn't ask for this.
I didn't choose this.

00:26:47,503 --> 00:26:49,974
The choice was made for me.

00:26:49,974 --> 00:26:53,347
Some things are just...
ordained.

00:26:53,347 --> 00:26:57,021
I sinned.

00:26:57,321 --> 00:26:59,859
I sinned, and now you and I
are both paying...

00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:03,767
Son of a bitch played us.

00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:06,038
STOKES:
Russell, she's gone.

00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:18,060
Nick, what happened?

00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,664
Shaw pulled Maya's wire
and left it in the car

00:27:20,664 --> 00:27:23,469
along with a digital recording
of his voice.

00:27:23,469 --> 00:27:25,807
Made it sound like they were
still in there talking.

00:27:25,807 --> 00:27:27,510
Any idea how they
got out of there?

00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,980
No, we're still working on that.

00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,618
Hey, Nick? Over here.

00:27:31,618 --> 00:27:33,354
STOKES:
Hey, I think we just found
Shaw's escape route.

00:27:33,354 --> 00:27:35,358
We're checking it out right now.

00:27:35,358 --> 00:27:36,860
Keep me posted.

00:27:49,484 --> 00:27:50,920
They're long gone.

00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,524
Well, look around here, man.
There's got to be something.

00:27:57,431 --> 00:27:59,602
Hey, here you go, Greg.

00:27:59,602 --> 00:28:01,071
Come over here
and take a look at this.

00:28:01,071 --> 00:28:02,875
It's a wedding ring.

00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,611
You think it's Maya's?

00:28:04,611 --> 00:28:07,717
I do. She's a CSI's
daughter, man.

00:28:07,717 --> 00:28:08,786
She's a smart girl.

00:28:08,786 --> 00:28:11,056
Leaving evidence behind
like bread crumbs.

00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,566
Next to what looks like
tire treads.

00:28:16,566 --> 00:28:18,069
Somebody peeled out of here.

00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:20,640
I think she's trying
to tell us they switched cars.

00:28:22,544 --> 00:28:25,883
That might not be all
she's trying to tell us.

00:28:25,883 --> 00:28:27,586
Flecks of red paint here.

00:28:27,586 --> 00:28:29,590
Must have been
from the driver's door.

00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:34,432
<i>Shaw gives her the keys,</i>
<i>tells her to drive.</i>

00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,970
<i>She drops her ring</i>
<i>by the rear tire</i>

00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,575
<i>and scratches the door</i>
<i>getting in.</i>

00:28:39,575 --> 00:28:41,646
SANDERS:
<i>Tire impressions and paint.</i>

00:28:41,646 --> 00:28:43,582
Could tell us what
they're driving.

00:28:49,526 --> 00:28:51,196
How is he doing?

00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,532
CRAWFORD:
Not good.

00:28:52,532 --> 00:28:54,535
Beating himself up.

00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,773
He's not the only one.

00:28:56,773 --> 00:28:59,578
I get it. We all want
to get Winthrop and Briscoe.

00:28:59,578 --> 00:29:00,847
And that son of
a bitch, Shaw.

00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,086
Should have heard him.

00:29:04,086 --> 00:29:05,823
Talking about
his exploits.

00:29:05,823 --> 00:29:09,096
Some story about stalking
a girl at a recital.

00:29:09,096 --> 00:29:13,070
Who knows how many women he
and those brothers have killed?

00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,574
What exactly did he say
about the girl at the recital?

00:29:15,574 --> 00:29:17,611
His exact words were,

00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:20,683
"It's hard to believe something
so beautiful could be mine."

00:29:20,683 --> 00:29:22,787
You scumbag.
That's it.

00:29:22,787 --> 00:29:24,490
That's what?
I got to go.

00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:25,592
Will you keep an eye on him?

00:29:25,592 --> 00:29:27,896
I have only seen him
like this once before, and

00:29:27,896 --> 00:29:29,165
it was not good.

00:29:37,614 --> 00:29:39,785
You don't have to worry.

00:29:39,785 --> 00:29:41,554
I'm not gonna run.

00:29:41,856 --> 00:29:43,825
I'm not even gonna
scream when you do to me

00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:45,763
whatever it is
you're gonna do.

00:29:45,763 --> 00:29:48,902
I'm not gonna give you
the satisfaction.

00:29:48,902 --> 00:29:50,138
You know,
when I was a cop in Seattle,

00:29:50,138 --> 00:29:52,207
I didn't have much respect
for people.

00:29:53,243 --> 00:29:54,879
But I always respected your dad.

00:29:56,949 --> 00:29:58,185
You're strong...

00:29:58,185 --> 00:30:00,089
like him.
You have no idea.

00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,462
I am not going
to make it easy.

00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:08,471
Light's green. Go.

00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:16,552
Hey.

00:30:16,552 --> 00:30:18,689
I'm so sorry.

00:30:18,689 --> 00:30:20,091
You heard about Maya.

00:30:20,091 --> 00:30:20,827
I did.

00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:24,266
Well, you were there yourself.

00:30:24,266 --> 00:30:27,539
And I had a dad
who held himself responsible

00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:32,080
for a decision that was just
as much mine as it was his.

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,017
Doesn't make it any easier.

00:30:34,017 --> 00:30:34,719
I know.

00:30:35,153 --> 00:30:37,224
Look, we're gonna get her back.

00:30:37,224 --> 00:30:40,095
We're gonna find her
just like you guys found me.

00:30:40,095 --> 00:30:43,935
Yeah. Yes, we are.

00:30:43,935 --> 00:30:45,639
Greg ran the, uh...

00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:47,542
tread patterns and the,
uh... the paint chip

00:30:47,542 --> 00:30:49,212
from where Shaw
switched cars,

00:30:49,212 --> 00:30:52,618
and it came back to a
2014 red Chevy Impala,

00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:54,989
which is like a needle in
a haystack around here.

00:30:54,989 --> 00:30:56,759
There are hundreds
of them in Nevada.

00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:59,163
What about you? You're-you're
running the-the bugs from

00:30:59,163 --> 00:31:01,902
the bodies, right, to track
down the killer's movement?
Yeah.

00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,237
We know
that the bodies were moved

00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:05,308
at least a few times
from the crime scene

00:31:05,308 --> 00:31:07,177
to The Mizu,
where they were harvested

00:31:07,177 --> 00:31:08,681
to make the killer's strings.

00:31:08,681 --> 00:31:11,185
And then Rebecca Lowell's
house where you found them.

00:31:11,185 --> 00:31:13,690
But given the condition
of the larvae on the bodies,

00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:16,795
it looks like they were frozen
and unfrozen more than that.

00:31:16,795 --> 00:31:19,601
So there might be
some other place they were kept.

00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:20,803
Exactly.

00:31:20,803 --> 00:31:22,940
Unfortunately,
the species of blowfly

00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,910
that I found on the bodies is

00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:27,048
far too common to zero in
on any specific location,

00:31:27,048 --> 00:31:30,854
but I'm hoping...

00:31:30,854 --> 00:31:32,692
that these guys are different.

00:31:32,692 --> 00:31:35,630
<i>Scolytus ventralis,</i>
the fir engraver beetle.

00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,901
Yeah. Most common
in northern Nevada,

00:31:37,901 --> 00:31:39,337
but I'm checking with the

00:31:39,337 --> 00:31:41,207
Bureau of Land Management
to see if they've had

00:31:41,207 --> 00:31:43,745
any infestations
closer to Vegas.

00:31:44,579 --> 00:31:46,683
It could be where
Shaw's taking Maya.

00:31:46,683 --> 00:31:49,756
Well, that's where the...
the hope part comes in.

00:31:49,756 --> 00:31:50,190
(beep)

00:31:50,891 --> 00:31:53,095
I got a response
from the Bureau.

00:31:53,095 --> 00:31:55,867
"In the last six months,
there have been reports

00:31:55,867 --> 00:31:57,670
"of fir engraver beetle
colonies threatening

00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,607
trees along Bighorn Ridge."

00:31:59,607 --> 00:32:01,243
That's right here.

00:32:01,243 --> 00:32:03,948
That's a big area.

00:32:03,948 --> 00:32:05,685
There are only a certain
amount of roads in there,

00:32:05,685 --> 00:32:07,622
so they have to pass
by a traffic camera

00:32:07,622 --> 00:32:08,690
at some point, right?
Right.

00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,160
Good work. Thanks.

00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:45,391
♪ ♪

00:32:45,391 --> 00:32:46,827
D.B., I need to talk to you.

00:32:46,827 --> 00:32:48,664
I know why Shaw's
doing what he's doing.

00:32:48,664 --> 00:32:50,033
Tell you the truth,
I don't really care,

00:32:50,033 --> 00:32:53,004
and I need to
get to PD.
I need you to hear this.

00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:55,809
The violin. The story
about the girl at the recital.

00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:58,047
That was not Shaw talking
about one of his victims.

00:32:58,047 --> 00:32:59,717
He was talking
about his daughter.

00:32:59,717 --> 00:33:01,053
I should've realized it
right away. The violin--

00:33:01,053 --> 00:33:02,722
it-it wasn't full size,

00:33:02,722 --> 00:33:04,091
it's a kid's
instrument, and-and...

00:33:04,091 --> 00:33:05,360
All right, slow
down, slow down.

00:33:07,698 --> 00:33:09,869
I ran the DNA on the violin.

00:33:09,869 --> 00:33:11,371
It's female.

00:33:11,371 --> 00:33:14,043
It's a familial match
to the dead woman that we found

00:33:14,043 --> 00:33:16,380
in the bed,
Rebecca Lowell's sister,

00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,217
and to Shaw.

00:33:18,217 --> 00:33:20,121
D.B., he had a daughter.

00:33:20,121 --> 00:33:23,226
You sure about this?
Yes, and it all makes sense now.

00:33:23,226 --> 00:33:26,366
He was protecting the escort
ring run by Rebecca Lowell,

00:33:26,366 --> 00:33:28,803
and in her records
it says that her sister

00:33:28,803 --> 00:33:30,239
was one of the escorts.

00:33:30,239 --> 00:33:33,111
So Shaw was involved with
the sister and had a kid.

00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,115
Yeah, and I confirmed
the birth records.

00:33:35,115 --> 00:33:36,919
Amy Lowell was born 2001.

00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:39,289
And I don't think I'm the only
one who's figured this out.

00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:42,428
Winthrop.
He is exploiting
Shaw's one weakness.

00:33:42,428 --> 00:33:44,899
And based on the evidence
that I found in that house,

00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:46,670
I think that Winthrop
murdered the mother

00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,973
and abducted the daughter
and now he's holding her

00:33:48,973 --> 00:33:51,679
for one reason
and one reason only.

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,181
To trade.

00:33:53,816 --> 00:33:56,421
Maya for Amy.

00:33:56,421 --> 00:33:58,758
My daughter for his.

00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,387
Shut off the engine.

00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:15,889
(engine stops)

00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,259
Give me the key.

00:34:19,997 --> 00:34:21,800
Get out.

00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,937
Why are you doing this?

00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:26,943
Because you don't
seem like the type.

00:34:26,943 --> 00:34:28,479
A killer.

00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:30,249
A man who preys on women.

00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,189
Let's go.

00:34:46,845 --> 00:34:48,349
Are they
waiting for me?

00:34:48,349 --> 00:34:50,152
You'll find out soon enough.

00:35:01,973 --> 00:35:03,142
WINTHROP:
Maya.

00:35:03,844 --> 00:35:04,712
Welcome.

00:35:05,847 --> 00:35:07,350
My brother was right.

00:35:08,485 --> 00:35:10,356
You're even more
beautiful in person.

00:35:11,725 --> 00:35:12,827
I told you so.

00:35:15,331 --> 00:35:17,000
Four years in prison.

00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:19,773
It was worth every day
just for this moment.

00:35:22,311 --> 00:35:23,346
You were right,
brother.

00:35:24,214 --> 00:35:26,051
Dreams really
do come true.

00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,136
We had a deal.
Where's my daughter?

00:35:36,404 --> 00:35:39,342
She's here.
And you'll have her.

00:35:39,342 --> 00:35:41,513
Just as soon as you
slide that gun over here.

00:35:41,513 --> 00:35:42,882
We wouldn't want
any surprises,

00:35:42,882 --> 00:35:44,751
would we?
I'm sure
you can understand.

00:35:44,751 --> 00:35:47,290
My brother and I don't
have a lot of trust in cops.

00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:48,291
Even dirty ones.

00:35:49,493 --> 00:35:51,364
Well, I don't
trust murderers.

00:35:51,364 --> 00:35:52,466
I want to see Amy.

00:35:56,206 --> 00:35:58,075
CRAWFORD:
Just got this from
the Northeast Division.

00:35:58,075 --> 00:36:00,881
That's Shaw's car traveling
east on Sunrise Highway.

00:36:00,881 --> 00:36:02,551
RUSSELL:
6:27 a.m.

00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:04,154
That's 20 minutes ago.

00:36:04,154 --> 00:36:06,057
Yeah, if Shaw's meeting with
Winthrop, Winthrop's M.O.

00:36:06,057 --> 00:36:08,395
says the location will
be an industrial area

00:36:08,395 --> 00:36:10,097
or a warehouse district.

00:36:10,097 --> 00:36:12,770
Right. Someplace isolated,
away from prying eyes.

00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,206
Pull up the map
of Bighorn Ridge.

00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:16,276
They're flooding this area
with patrol units.

00:36:16,276 --> 00:36:18,112
We've also scrambled
air support.

00:36:18,112 --> 00:36:19,348
We got eyes in the sky.
That's still

00:36:19,348 --> 00:36:21,319
a hell of lot of real estate.
Yes, it is.

00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:23,288
But we're getting closer.

00:36:23,288 --> 00:36:24,390
Control, this is Air-Seven.

00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,394
Just identified
the suspect vehicle.

00:36:26,394 --> 00:36:28,265
Red Chevy Impala, license number

00:36:28,265 --> 00:36:31,437
Adam-Tom-David-Charlie 425.

00:36:31,437 --> 00:36:33,307
What's your
location, Air-Seven?

00:36:33,307 --> 00:36:35,210
1500 block of Sunrise Highway.

00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,346
Looks like
some kind of warehouse.

00:36:36,346 --> 00:36:37,348
Come on, let's go.
Yeah.

00:36:41,488 --> 00:36:43,259
Amy.
Dad.

00:36:43,259 --> 00:36:45,128
Ah, ah, ah,
not so fast.

00:36:45,128 --> 00:36:48,101
There'll be plenty of time
for hugs and kisses later.

00:36:49,003 --> 00:36:50,105
The gun.

00:36:50,305 --> 00:36:53,010
You all right,
sweetheart?

00:37:02,227 --> 00:37:05,432
I want to get out of here.
Where's my mom?

00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:06,401
It's gonna be all right.

00:37:06,401 --> 00:37:08,138
Are you
all right?
Yeah.

00:37:09,172 --> 00:37:10,374
So sweet.

00:37:10,374 --> 00:37:13,414
Nothing like family,
right, Jared?

00:37:13,414 --> 00:37:14,883
When do I get
what's coming to me?

00:37:14,883 --> 00:37:16,385
Patience, brother.

00:37:16,385 --> 00:37:18,489
You know we can't
have any loose ends.

00:37:20,994 --> 00:37:22,196
I should've figured
you'd do this.

00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:29,443
You should've figured a dirty
cop would have a throwaway. Run.

00:37:40,296 --> 00:37:42,867
(both grunting)

00:37:42,867 --> 00:37:54,522
(gasping)

00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:59,564
(crunch)

00:38:04,473 --> 00:38:06,244
(gunshot)

00:38:12,321 --> 00:38:15,093
You think you're
smarter than me?

00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:24,444
You've taken from me
the only family I've ever had.

00:38:24,444 --> 00:38:26,113
The only real family.

00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,317
The only real love in my life.

00:38:28,317 --> 00:38:31,089
(soft grunting)
I saw how you looked
at your little girl.

00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:33,460
I know how much
she means to you.

00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,365
She's not gonna get very far,
'cause I'm gonna find her.

00:38:36,365 --> 00:38:38,168
And just so you know,

00:38:38,502 --> 00:38:41,475
when I do, I'm gonna
do things to her

00:38:41,475 --> 00:38:43,277
you can't even imagine.

00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:49,155
(grunts)
(groaning)

00:38:54,197 --> 00:38:56,201
Don't move.

00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:57,203
I'll get help.

00:39:05,452 --> 00:39:07,255
Maya,

00:39:07,255 --> 00:39:08,925
you all right?
Yeah, I'm okay.

00:39:08,925 --> 00:39:10,694
Where are they?
Inside.
Shaw's wounded.

00:39:10,694 --> 00:39:12,565
And Winthrop and Briscoe
are dead, I think.

00:39:12,565 --> 00:39:13,700
Let's roll, boys.

00:39:14,468 --> 00:39:18,442
(indistinct police radio
chatter, helicopter blades whir)

00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,712
Check the back.

00:39:28,026 --> 00:39:29,729
Briscoe's dead.

00:39:29,729 --> 00:39:32,334
I got a pulse, but it's faint.

00:39:32,334 --> 00:39:35,005
Charlie-04-Stokes.
I need immediate medical

00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,441
at my location.

00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:37,610
Maya said that Winthrop's dead.

00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,480
But where the hell is he?

00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,387
(siren wails,
tires screeching)

00:39:49,365 --> 00:39:52,170
Hey.
Hey.

00:39:53,473 --> 00:39:54,507
You must be Amy, yeah?

00:39:54,507 --> 00:39:56,378
I'm Detective Crawford.

00:39:56,378 --> 00:39:58,449
We're gonna get you
out of here, okay?

00:39:58,449 --> 00:40:00,252
Dad.

00:40:01,587 --> 00:40:03,224
Hey.

00:40:03,224 --> 00:40:05,160
You were so brave.

00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,429
Learned from the best.

00:40:09,569 --> 00:40:10,537
I was afraid...

00:40:11,038 --> 00:40:14,578
I know. I know. Me, too.

00:40:27,535 --> 00:40:29,038
Hey.

00:40:29,038 --> 00:40:31,142
Hi.

00:40:31,442 --> 00:40:32,678
How are you doing?

00:40:34,581 --> 00:40:36,718
I've... been better.

00:40:36,718 --> 00:40:38,355
How's Amy doing?

00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:40,391
She's safe.

00:40:40,526 --> 00:40:43,531
She's with
Child Protective Services now.

00:40:43,531 --> 00:40:45,000
They're not gonna let me
see her, are they?

00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,709
Well, that's probably
just the same.

00:40:49,709 --> 00:40:52,347
I was never a very good father
to her anyway.

00:40:52,347 --> 00:40:54,484
Just... some guy who showed up

00:40:54,484 --> 00:40:56,588
from time to time,
took her to the park,

00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:58,592
got her some ice cream,

00:40:58,592 --> 00:41:00,095
then I was gone again.

00:41:03,266 --> 00:41:04,737
I just wish
you would've come to me

00:41:04,737 --> 00:41:06,539
before all this happened.

00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:08,477
Maybe I could've helped.

00:41:08,477 --> 00:41:09,579
I should've.

00:41:09,579 --> 00:41:10,380
Yeah.

00:41:13,352 --> 00:41:15,623
There's something
you can do for me now.

00:41:15,623 --> 00:41:18,294
Amy's got a grandmother,

00:41:18,294 --> 00:41:20,332
lives in Texas.
She's a good woman.

00:41:20,332 --> 00:41:24,105
I just can't bear to see her
get lost in the system.

00:41:24,105 --> 00:41:26,075
I'll make sure she doesn't.

00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:30,250
You should just focus
on getting better.

00:41:31,352 --> 00:41:33,623
That's when
the trouble starts, right?

00:41:33,623 --> 00:41:36,428
When I get out of here?

00:41:46,512 --> 00:41:47,714
I talked to Greg.

00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:50,152
He and Nick are still
processing the scene.

00:41:50,152 --> 00:41:52,156
They found a blood trail
leading from the building

00:41:52,156 --> 00:41:53,625
to a drainage tunnel,

00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:55,329
which led to a wash.

00:41:55,329 --> 00:41:56,598
But no Winthrop?

00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:57,432
No.

00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,809
RUSSELL:
All these women.

00:42:05,514 --> 00:42:07,651
Maya was almost one of them.

00:42:08,185 --> 00:42:09,721
But she wasn't.

00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:13,762
You came close, D.B.

00:42:13,762 --> 00:42:15,165
The greater good.

00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,526
Briscoe's dead,
and Winthrop's on the run,

00:42:17,526 --> 00:42:18,093
a fugitive.

00:42:18,093 --> 00:42:19,595
You can plaster
his face everywhere,

00:42:19,595 --> 00:42:20,863
freeze his accounts.

00:42:21,697 --> 00:42:23,432
You're in the driver's seat.

00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,068
Why doesn't it feel like that?

00:42:28,437 --> 00:42:29,071
No.

00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,006
No, this guy's a predator.

00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:33,476
He's an animal.

00:42:33,476 --> 00:42:35,144
You know what they say.

00:42:35,144 --> 00:42:36,679
Animals are most dangerous
when they're cornered.
