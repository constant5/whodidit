00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:02,402
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:12,646
GUARD:
Let's go! On the line!

00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:15,282
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:27,694
GUARD:
Okay, settle down! Keep moving!

00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:37,437
(gasping anxiously)

00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:38,672
INMATE:
I-I don't...

00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:40,173
(muttering, gasping)

00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,276
(inmate mutters)

00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:46,647
Hey... I can't do this, man.

00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,148
I-I hate needles.
Shut up.

00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,651
I hate needles.
Please, please...

00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:53,720
Please, please, please
don't make me, I can't...

00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,022
I can't do this...
Just relax.

00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,124
INMATE:
Nobody listens to me.

00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:57,758
No...

00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,426
I hate needles.

00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,361
Relax...
I hate needles!
I hate...

00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,363
Nobody's listening to me!

00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,766
No... Nobody's
listening to me!

00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:09,636
(alarm blaring,
inmates clamoring)

00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,739
GUARD: Backup needed in the
inmate reception-- now!

00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,741
(men shouting)

00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,043
GUARD:
O'Malley-- we need backup!

00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:17,110
(alarm bell rings)

00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,145
(all clamoring)

00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,251
Shut up! Shut up!

00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,252
Yo, man...
Shut up!

00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,520
Shut up!

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,654
(yelling)

00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,091
Shut up! Shut up!

00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,493
(gasping)

00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,996
GUARD: On your knees now!
Hands above your head!

00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:38,031
(yelling)

00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:42,269
GUARD: Inmate,
drop to the floor now!

00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,105
(screaming)

00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:00,687
Crime lab.

00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:16,169
Thanks.
DETECTIVE:
You must be Russell

00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,304
and Stokes with the crime lab.

00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,338
Detective Carl Brenner.

00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,641
How do you do?
Heard you guys are
the best. Follow me.

00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,644
I'm kind of the, uh,
new guy in Homicide.

00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,512
Youngest detective ever promoted
into the bureau.

00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,080
Been there just over two years.

00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,384
Love the job.
Oh. Well,
congratulations.

00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,085
BRENNER:
Well, you know what they say--

00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,087
you can't solve murders
sitting behind a desk.

00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:37,491
A motto I live by.
So... I work 24/7.

00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,692
You need me, you call me.

00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,127
Home number's
on the back.

00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:41,261
Right up here, guys.

00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,064
(indistinct conversations)

00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:47,167
Quite a ruckus, huh?
Sure was.

00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:48,735
STOKES:
What happened to him?

00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,203
BRENNER: Took a punch
in the commotion.

00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,304
He's fine. Door!

00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,305
(lock buzzes)

00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,744
(muffled screaming)

00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,414
(louder, muffled screams)

00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:01,982
What's his story?

00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,117
BRENNER: Well, that's the cause
of the circus right there.

00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,453
Denny Morrison--
he's got some mental issues.

00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,321
Freaked out
getting a flu shot.

00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:12,693
When he ran in here, the, uh,
extraction team got him.

00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,995
Watch your step
through here.

00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:18,031
Good thing it wasn't
a busy laundry day, right?

00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:22,035
Anyway, in the process,
they found this guy.

00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,137
Name's Bruce Grady.

00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,672
There's a long rap sheet.
He's, uh,

00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,240
awaiting trial on armed robbery.

00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:29,409
Did he work in here?

00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,578
No, he's assigned to the med mod
up on the third floor.

00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,246
What's a hard-core felon doing

00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,082
assigned to a low-risk
medical module?

00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,651
Well, he had cirrhosis of the
liver-- on a bunch of meds.

00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,352
Had one foot in the grave.

00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,354
STOKES: Someone must have
gotten impatient.

00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,223
He's been stabbed pretty good.
Look at that.

00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,427
So we have an inmate
from the medical module

00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:50,731
found three floors below,
stabbed to death.

00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,566
Any particular enemies?

00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,102
This is County--
everyone in here has enemies.

00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:56,503
That narrows it down.

00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:58,739
RUSSELL:
We have one victim...

00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,143
and 2,000 caged suspects.

00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,313
I hate laundry.

00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,649
I could never work
in a place like this.

00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,751
I don't know, it beats
sitting in your cell

00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,320
with some
sketchy roommate.
I don't know,

00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,122
I think an inmate would
have been preferable

00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,224
to my first
college roommate.

00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,626
Hmm. Nutjob, huh?

00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,460
Oh, yeah.

00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,464
Liver temp
is 94 degrees.

00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,399
He's been dead
around three hours.

00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,201
So, 7:00 p.m.
That's about right.

00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,171
Did you find any other
stab wounds, Dave?

00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,572
Just the one you already saw.

00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:08,508
And a defensive wound
on his hand.

00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,677
It looks like
there's some residue

00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,012
on his hands as well.

00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,047
Blood drops on his clothing

00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,615
are gravitational and elongated.

00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:17,484
And...

00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,053
there is blood
on the bottom of his shoes,

00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,721
so he was
walking around bleeding.

00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,758
So where is
all the blood?

00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,562
There's some over here
near the sink.

00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:29,996
Hot water handle.

00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,566
Killer could have injured
himself during a struggle.

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,135
Needed to wash up.

00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,678
Hey, I've got a bloody towel
over here, as well.

00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:49,749
And somebody did

00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,451
a lousy mop job.

00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,657
Okay, I'm gonna grab the guys,
we'll pick up the body,

00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:00,160
and I'll text you
when Doc schedules the post.

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,061
Thanks, Dave.

00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,531
Nick, look at this.

00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,635
Same residue as
on the victim's hands.

00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,439
"M.M."

00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:15,242
Medical Module, maybe?

00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:17,410
Wasn't the victim housed there?

00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,180
Well, that would explain
how he got down here.

00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,615
He was hiding in
the laundry cart.

00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:24,517
Yeah, but there's
no blood inside.

00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:28,321
Okay, so he was uninjured
when he got in,

00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,223
<i>and attacked when</i>
<i>he got down here.</i>

00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,224
(yells in pain)

00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,226
Question is, did he
come down here voluntarily,

00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,362
or did somebody force him
to take the ride?

00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:38,498
Yeah. Well, either way,
we're gonna have to find out

00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,000
who was pushing that cart.

00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:46,706
SANDERS:
Strep.

00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,442
Pink eye.

00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,344
Impetigo?

00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,447
I mean, you can practically feel
the germs jumping on you.

00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,349
(laughs) You're
being paranoid.

00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,519
You do remember
that I was just quarantined.

00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,055
Yes, and you survived
the Ibare virus,

00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,157
which means you can probably
handle a little bit of pink eye.

00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,125
If you say so.

00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,259
Here we are.

00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,061
Our victim's cell.
(sighs)

00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,996
You know, this is
all new to me.

00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:13,066
We never worked jail cases
back at LAPD.
Yeah, well,

00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,467
welcome to Clark County.

00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,074
Ladies first.

00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:25,111
(sighs heavily)

00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,648
Well... Grady's cell
is pretty clean.

00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:32,585
Doesn't look like there was
any struggle of any sort.

00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,590
Photo of his daughter Rachel.

00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,360
It's got to be tough
missing your kid grow up.

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,594
Yeah.

00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,131
This artwork here
explains the residue

00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,533
on Grady's hands.

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,172
He had some talent--
these are good drawings.

00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,741
SANDERS:
Lake views, forests, birds.

00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:57,544
All showing
the beauty of nature.
Hard to believe

00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:00,146
he'd want to be reminded of that
while he's in here.

00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,082
SANDERS:
Well, maybe in here is where

00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,583
you need to be reminded
the most.

00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:17,063
Ugh. That's some nasty
medicine he was taking.

00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,698
BRODY:
Got a file folder here

00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,067
full of legal paperwork.

00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,371
Well, that makes sense--
inmates are allowed

00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:26,206
to keep their case files
with them in their cell.

00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,214
Hey, look at this.

00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,584
Oh. That's a jail kite.

00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,320
It's how inmates communicate
from cell to cell.

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,189
<i>A message is written on paper,</i>

00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,592
<i>which is folded</i>
<i>into a triangular kite.</i>

00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:50,163
<i>The string is there, in case</i>
<i>they need to pull it back,</i>

00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:52,332
<i>if it ends up somewhere</i>
<i>they didn't want it to go.</i>

00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,441
"Liars don't last
long in here.

00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:03,343
Watch your back."

00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,645
That's a pretty
serious warning.

00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,680
Sounds more like
a threat to me--

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,216
one our killer wasn't afraid
to follow up on.

00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,220
(lock buzzes, clicks)

00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,090
So, Officer Woo,
you were the guard

00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,525
in charge of
the laundry room today?

00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,293
Laundry's
my regular assignment.

00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,462
I work days on a four/ten,
Sunday to Wednesday.

00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,164
Okay. And you
work alone?

00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,066
Yeah. It's
a solo gig now.

00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,700
You know,
budget cuts.

00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,069
Did you know the
victim, Bruce Grady?

00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,004
Seen him around,
like any other inmate.

00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:34,040
Well, did you know that
he was transported in a cart

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,142
to the laundry room
during your shift?

00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,178
No. Didn't.

00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,379
Where were you
around 7:00 p.m.?

00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,748
Supply trucks got delayed
by a pileup on the 15.

00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,383
Arrived three hours late.

00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:46,019
Took my laundry trustees
down to the dock to unload it.

00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,388
That was around... 6:45.

00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,757
How long
did that take?
15, 20 minutes.

00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,225
So you left the laundry
unsupervised?

00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,461
Nobody should have
been in there.

00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,996
I had six trustees with me,
and the rest were upstairs

00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,631
doing linen swap.
How was the trustee

00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:01,067
in charge of swapping the linens
out of the medical module?

00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,135
Third floor.

00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,403
That'd be Wilbur Tandy.

00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,040
Laundry trustee--

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,042
that's a pretty good
gig, huh, Wilbur?

00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,511
I like the routine--
it gets me out of my cell.

00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:14,013
Got Bruce Grady
out of his cell, too.

00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,515
Did you take him down
to the laundry room?

00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:17,250
Just following orders.

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,618
Orders from who?

00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,020
Now, I wouldn't last
very long in here

00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,189
if I questioned who's
giving the orders.
You saying

00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,325
you don't want to tell me, or
are you saying you don't know?

00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:28,294
I'm saying I don't want
to end up like Grady.

00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,630
Another option is, we can charge
you with accessory to murder.

00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,765
And I ask for a lawyer
and you get nothing.

00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:33,967
STOKES: All right,
all right, Wilbur...

00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,536
I'm working for
the dead man here.

00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,472
Now who gave you that order?

00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,675
Got a kite.

00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,978
Said bring Grady to the laundry

00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,613
during the linen swap,
so I did.

00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:47,981
Grady got a kite, too.

00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,716
Pretty threatening one.

00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,151
So, we're supposed
to expect he, uh,

00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,686
voluntarily got into your cart,

00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,221
knowing it could be
his last ride?

00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:56,022
You don't get it.

00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:59,492
Nothing sent by a
kite is a request.

00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,627
Grady knew that.

00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:01,494
He had to go.

00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,297
Did he say anything?
Nah.

00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:06,599
He was out of it.
He was drugged up on something.

00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,201
Could barely get
in the cart.

00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,203
Okay, so, you took him
downstairs, then what?

00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,604
Left the cart,
got another one.

00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,174
I told you,
I got my routine.

00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,242
You see who he was meeting with?
Nope.

00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,443
Dropped him off and left.

00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,611
STOKES:
You can help us

00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,079
eliminate you as a suspect

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,614
by giving your DNA sample.

00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,017
I gave my DNA at intake.
Use that.

00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,319
Well, you've got your
routine, I've got mine.

00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,488
I take a DNA sample from
everybody I've talked to.

00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,990
No exceptions.
What do I get
if I give it to you?

00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,259
Well, you get to keep
being laundry trustee.

00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:39,999
RUSSELL:
<i>So, where are we</i>

00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,202
with Bruce
Grady's enemies?

00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,503
There's no record
of any incidents

00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:44,470
since he's been in jail,

00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,673
but I did pull his rap sheet
to look at his history,

00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,641
and I found
a very interesting trend.

00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:54,013
Every time he's arrested,
the charges got reduced.

00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:54,470
Yeah.

00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,082
Suspiciously reduced, I'd say,

00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,617
and there's only one way
that could happen.

00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:00,253
Grady was making deals
with the DA.

00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,256
So, the guy
was an informant.
Yeah. So,

00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:06,092
I cross-matched cases where
he appeared as a witness

00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,595
to inmates who are currently
assigned to the jail,

00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,697
and I found out
something very big.

00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:13,066
Grady was the star witness

00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,735
in the murder case
of Lincoln Mayfield.

00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,005
Mayfield--
the Snakeback assassin.

00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:21,741
Yeah, but he was convicted,
so he wouldn't be in jail.

00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,509
He's got to be
upstate in prison, right?

00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,713
Well, he was, but the case was
overturned on a technicality.

00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:28,715
The retrial is this week.

00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:31,618
And Mayfield was brought back
to County for the trial.

00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,286
He arrived two days ago.

00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,356
(lock buzzes, clicks)

00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:38,424
GUARD:
Mayfield!

00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,292
On your feet!

00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,663
Turn around,
hands behind your back.

00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,711
Hey, Mayfield,
lookie here.

00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,216
You want to explain this?

00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,620
I ain't sayin'
nothin' to no cop.

00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,223
You got a problem with that,
talk to my lawyer.

00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,664
RUSSELL: Well, Mayfield
lawyered up, so,

00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,167
he won't be talking.
No surprise.

00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,704
D.A. handling the retrial gave
me a copy of the case file.

00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:58,671
Care to take a look?

00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,641
(grunts) Please tell me there's
a <i>Reader's Digest</i> version.

00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:04,644
All right, as the so-called

00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:08,047
"Snakeback Assassin,"
Mayfield was suspected

00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,083
of over a dozen
gangland murders.

00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,484
Yeah.
I remember this one.

00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:14,120
Young, pregnant woman
caught in the crossfire.

00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,556
They thought it was
a Mayfield hit, right?
Yeah.

00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:19,359
Witnesses were, of course,
afraid to come forward.

00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,694
Consequently, the D.A. never
had enough to charge him.

00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,762
So, let me guess.

00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:25,365
They decided to go
with a jail informant.

00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,301
You got it. They put Bruce Grady
in a cell next to Mayfield.

00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:31,337
And after a while,
Grady got him to talk.

00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,306
Mayfield confessed?

00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:37,043
No, but he provided details
that only the killer would know.

00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,545
It was enough in court,
and bottom line is,

00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,647
Grady's testimony
put Mayfield away.

00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,216
Well, there's Mayfield's motive.

00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,151
Payback for Grady's testimony.

00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:46,352
(phone ringing)

00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,155
Boy, I didn't see this coming.

00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:52,759
Nick says
Mayfield wants to talk.

00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:58,398
My lawyer here ain't happy, but
I got to tell you about Grady.

00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,233
You're compelled to
tell me about Grady,

00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,434
'cause he testified
against you.

00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,069
That's just it.

00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,704
That was all lies.

00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,406
Dude stood up there and said

00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,608
I told him stuff
while we was locked up together?

00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,977
I never told him nothin'.

00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:12,111
And that pissed you off.

00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,180
Hmm.
Hmm. Were you mad
enough to kill him?

00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,615
I didn't kill homeboy.

00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:18,351
You sent a kite to Wilbur,
ordering him to take Grady

00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:19,318
to the laundry room.

00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,087
To talk,
straighten him out.

00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,555
Why'd you bring a weapon?

00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,157
Never know
who gonna make a move.

00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:26,459
Look, all I wanted for him

00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,761
was to do right by me
and take back those lies.

00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:34,300
Okay, so you guys talk,
and then what?

00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,501
Things just go sideways?

00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,237
Dude showed up wasted,
makin' no sense.

00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:44,177
Hey, Grady?

00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,711
You're gonna tell 'em
you lied, hear me?

00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,680
You're gonna make things right.
Just be cool.

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,582
I can hook you up in here.

00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:50,583
Look here, old man...

00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:53,753
Hey!

00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,455
(Grady shouts, groans)

00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,724
So you shank him?

00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,092
To get his attention....

00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,260
Lincoln.

00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,697
Look, I shanked
a few dudes in my day.

00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,400
Poke I gave him
wouldn't kill nobody.

00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,302
You got his attention.
Now what?

00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:14,207
I... strongly suggested
that he come clean.

00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,642
(grunting)
Tell 'em you lied,

00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,211
I'm gonna kill you.

00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:19,345
Okay, okay.

00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,380
And if you tell the D.A.
about our little talk,

00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,550
I'm gonna kill you ugly.

00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,486
I swear, I won't tell anyone.

00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,120
I swear.

00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,057
Not a word.

00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,426
You stabbed him, but you weren't
trying to kill him?

00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,228
I couldn't <i>afford</i>
to kill him.

00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:38,297
I needed him alive
to tell the DA that he lied.

00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,665
That's why I'm talking to you.

00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,534
I'm telling you,

00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:44,470
him being murdered
is bad for me.

00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,406
Real bad.

00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:01,587
(sniffing)

00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,222
Ooh.

00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,658
That odor is
disgustingly familiar.

00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,393
It's the smell of success.

00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,563
I'd hate to find out
what failure smells like.

00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:13,032
Hey, did you
ever figure out

00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,067
what that medicine
was in Grady's trash?

00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,469
Wasn't medicine.

00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,005
It was hooch. Pruno.

00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,406
Jail alcohol.

00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,441
I'm making a batch right now,

00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,677
using only items available
to the inmates.

00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:26,245
It's a simple recipe, really.

00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,548
Fermentation is the conversion

00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,516
of sugars to alcohol,
using yeast.

00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:34,353
<i>You combine fruit,</i>
<i>juice, sugar and bread.</i>

00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,621
<i>Mix and wait.</i>

00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,391
<i>The yeast from the bread</i>
<i>does all the work.</i>

00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,359
<i>You just have to vent it</i>
<i>occasionally</i>

00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,029
<i>to release the accumulated CO2,</i>
<i>and you're good.</i>

00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,998
Witness said
that Grady was out of it.

00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:49,268
Maybe he was just
drunk on pruno.

00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,371
Maybe he just needed
a little liquid courage.

00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,174
If I had to face someone
who wanted to kill me,

00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,076
I'd drink, too.

00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:09,522
Mm. That looks like something
out of a zombie movie.

00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:12,224
No, it's Bruce
Grady's liver.

00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,427
Cirrhosis causes cells

00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,696
and scar tissue
to create nodules,

00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,431
rendering it ineffective

00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,299
as the body's main
filtration system.

00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,300
Makes you not want to have

00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,069
that second glass
of wine at dinner.

00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:24,437
Speak for yourself.

00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,672
So, what about
the stab wound?

00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,975
Well, it's a single laceration

00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:32,712
penetrating the external
abdominal oblique muscle.

00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:37,083
It's an inch wide, and about
one and a half inches in depth.

00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,484
That's not very deep.

00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,086
I'm surprised
that it killed him.

00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,454
Well, it didn't.

00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,222
Take a look here.

00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:45,992
Petechiae.

00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,427
So he died
from asphyxiation.

00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:50,730
ROBBINS:
<i>Manually strangled.</i>

00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,431
(gasping)

00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:57,003
You can see finger-shaped
contusions beginning to form.

00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:01,340
I swabbed the neck for
epithelial DNA from our killer.

00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,175
Already sent it to Henry.

00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:06,212
So, he was stabbed,
and then he was strangled.

00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:07,513
That makes no sense.

00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,749
That shank could have
done major damage.

00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:12,018
So, why would you
strangle someone

00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:14,153
if you had a perfectly
good weapon?

00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,621
You wouldn't.

00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,624
Maybe Mayfield was
telling the truth.

00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,262
SANDERS:
Inmates can get pretty creative

00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,031
concealing their contraband,

00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:30,369
so let's just be sure to check
every hem, edge, seam...

00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,004
So it's a tactile examination.

00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:32,972
Pretty much.

00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:34,440
But never forget.

00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,310
The most popular hiding place
is the jail wallet.

00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,478
What?

00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,280
The keister stash.

00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,050
Ah, well, I am double gloved,
so, I'm good.

00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:48,187
I heard about this
inmate whose family

00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,322
smuggled him drugs
by melting them

00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:53,392
and using the mixture
to paint a picture

00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,493
in a coloring book.

00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,063
"To Daddy. Love Lindsay."
It's kind of hard

00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,432
to explain a guy licking
a picture of a princess.

00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:00,766
Maybe in the
outside world,

00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,302
but in jail, not so much.

00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:09,375
(sighs)

00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:10,543
Greg...

00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,144
take a look at this.

00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:22,054
It's a tiny recording device.

00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,256
I've never seen
one that small.

00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,391
It's state-of-the-art.

00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,427
I saw one of these at the
forensic conference last month.

00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:31,363
It's not even available to law
enforcement until next year.

00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,666
Well, then, how did
Bruce Grady get one?

00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,569
Well, the vendor did say that

00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:40,372
one law enforcement agency would
be chosen to test the prototype.

00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:43,209
I wonder which agency
that would be.

00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:48,447
Agent Parker,
thank you for seeing me.

00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,216
Your call said it was urgent.

00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,619
We found this

00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,988
in the cell of an inmate
at County.

00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:57,189
You recognize it?

00:20:58,224 --> 00:20:59,425
I might.
Yeah.

00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,094
We found that
after the inmate was murdered.

00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,698
(wry chuckle)

00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:07,266
All right, look,

00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,669
Bruce Grady was a CI
for the DA's Office--

00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:14,006
I already knew that-- but he was
also an informant for the FBI,

00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:16,976
I'm not going to divulge details

00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:18,444
on an ongoing investigation.

00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,478
I can appreciate that,

00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,114
but after the guy was murdered,

00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,083
you might have picked up
the phone and told us.

00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,518
Saved us a lot
of trouble.

00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,286
Our investigation
is confidential.

00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,622
Your investigation
is very likely the reason

00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,157
why we're in this mess.

00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:33,125
Look, we think
that Grady

00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,761
was killed by that same inmate
that you're investigating.

00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:36,428
So come on.

00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,429
Let's work
together here.

00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:43,435
Well, that's assuming the focus
of our investigation

00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:45,104
is an inmate.

00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:49,275
You're investigating a guard.

00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:53,746
(sighs)

00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:58,150
So Grady was not
just informing on crooks.

00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,219
He was informing on cops.

00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,393
ECKLIE: <i>Agent Parker,</i>
<i>you blindsided me on this.</i>

00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:09,528
There's such a thing
as professional courtesy.

00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:12,364
The FBI is under no obligation
to share information with you.

00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:14,466
Oh, please. Drop the
federal policy-speak.

00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:15,701
We're on the
same side here.

00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,470
If one of my guards is dirty,
I want to know about it.

00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,572
Now, who are you looking at?

00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:21,006
We're empanelling a grand jury.

00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,474
We expect an indictment any day.

00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,043
I'm not going to risk a leak.

00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,177
A leak?

00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,679
RUSSELL:
We're investigating the murder

00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,515
of yourCI,
and you won't share with us?

00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,084
Sorry.
Best we can do is work

00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,185
our cases in parallel.

00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,287
If your investigation
collides with ours,

00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,622
maybe then we can talk.

00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:38,457
Have a nice day.

00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:43,596
Perfect. A federal
corruption investigation.

00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:45,764
We'll work the case
as fast as we can, Conrad.

00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,602
If Grady's killer turns out
to be a-a jail guard...

00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:51,437
Yeah, please let me be
the first to know.

00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:57,699
Hey.

00:22:57,699 --> 00:22:59,478
What do you
got for me?
All the blood

00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,614
Finn and Nick collected
in the laundry room came back

00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:04,216
to the victim, Bruce Grady,
including the blood on the sink.

00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,119
Okay, what about the shank?
Mm. No surprises there.

00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,655
Blood on the blade was Grady's.
DNA on the handle

00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:11,156
came back
to Lincoln Mayfield.

00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:12,124
A perfect equation,

00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,493
except that the shank
isn't the murder weapon

00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,195
'cause Grady was strangled.

00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:18,731
I found epithelials
on the victim's neck swab.

00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,432
DNA doesn't match Mayfield.

00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:23,235
DNA has to be the killer's.
Did you run it through CODIS?

00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,403
No hits.

00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,506
Given that all inmates
are entered into the system...

00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,275
Means we're not looking
for an inmate.

00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,143
Just like we feared,

00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,579
looks like Grady's
killer is a guard.

00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:38,317
So, Grady
was reportedly intoxicated

00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:39,418
at the time of his murder,

00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,553
and yet
his tox report

00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:45,624
says that his blood alcohol
level was 0.03%.

00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:47,359
0.03?

00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,595
That wouldn't make anyone
stagger,

00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,131
let alone an alcoholic
like Grady.
No.

00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,700
They also found
a half-dozen prescription drugs

00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,303
in his system,
all on his medical record,

00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:59,672
except for one,
a drug named terbinafine.

00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:01,640
What's that taken for?

00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,042
Skin infections.

00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,310
And this
is the interesting part:

00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,513
they do not dispense terbinafine
in the jail infirmary.

00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:09,448
Okay, so where'd he get it from?
I don't know,

00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,251
but somebody with access to the
outside must've given it to him.

00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:13,619
Huh. All right.

00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,321
Let me see here.

00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:16,588
Terbinafine.

00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:18,724
Here we go.

00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,160
"Terbinafine
should never be taken

00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,662
"by people with liver problems.
Can cause

00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:26,231
confusion and an unsteady gait."

00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,167
That would explain
why he seemed intoxicated.

00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,201
And get this,

00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:32,404
"cases of death have been
reported in individuals

00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,273
with cirrhosis of the liver."

00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,608
So somebody
was poisoning him

00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,410
before he went down
to the laundry.

00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,379
Yeah, and they must have gotten
tired of waiting for that poison

00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,548
to take effect, went hands-on
and strangled him.

00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:46,051
You know, Henry's DNA evidence
does back up the fact

00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,486
that we might be looking
at a guard.

00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,722
Well, the laundry was guarded
by Officer Woo,

00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:52,758
who just so happened to be gone
when the murder went down.

00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:54,760
Wow, that is awfully convenient.

00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,164
FINLAY: <i>So you said</i>
<i>that, on Sunday night,</i>

00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,332
at about 7:00 p.m.,

00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,968
you were not
in the laundry room.
Right.

00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:04,236
I was on the
loading dock.

00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:07,039
And you were on the loading dock
for approximately 20 minutes?

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,707
Give or take.

00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,643
You're on direct deposit
for your LVPD paychecks,

00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:12,211
is that correct?

00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:14,413
And your wife,
she doesn't work, does she?

00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:16,615
So?
So I see
that there are several

00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:19,184
cash deposits
to your account each month,

00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:23,422
last month, totaling
more than $4,000.

00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,292
Is there a rich uncle
that I don't know about?

00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,330
It's funny, if you want
to know what the guards

00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,765
are actually doing
when they're on the job,

00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:35,334
you just have
to ask the inmates.

00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:39,071
You want to know about Woo?
I'll tell you about Woo.

00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:41,707
He takes money
to look the other way.

00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,076
It's common knowledge you can
get anything in the laundry.

00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:46,311
Drugs, weapons, sex.

00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,647
Woo won't say a word
for the right price.

00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:51,083
Laundry's a three-ring circus.

00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:54,153
Woo lets inmates do
whatever they want.

00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,355
Look...

00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:58,590
my wife has a shopping problem.

00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,292
Our credit
cards are maxed.

00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,994
I can't even cover
the minimum payments.

00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:05,064
So I get it: You need to make
some extra money on the side.

00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,065
It started small.

00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:09,435
I snuck in some pot brownies
for an inmate with migraines.

00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:12,037
He told two friends.
They told two friends...

00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:14,139
Pretty soon, I got inmates
threatening to rat me out

00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:15,207
if I don't help 'em out, too.

00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,476
I'd lose my job.

00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,380
I'd lose everything.

00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,450
Let's talk about Sunday night.

00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,653
Mayfield paid me to stay away
while he met with Grady.

00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,556
Had two grand
delivered to my house.

00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:33,025
Said they were
just gonna talk.

00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:34,726
How much did you know
about Grady?

00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:36,728
I knew he was a snitch.

00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,263
Yeah. For the FBI.

00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:41,200
He was helping them
with a corruption case

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,367
involving a jail guard.

00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,636
I think
that you found out

00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,638
that Grady was snitching you out
to the Feds,

00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:49,441
so you let Mayfield have
a little alone time with him,

00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,610
hoping that Mayfield would do
your dirty work.

00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:53,579
Only when you got back
to the laundry room,

00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:56,248
Grady was still alive
so you had to kill him.

00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:58,550
No. No way.
I didn't kill Grady.

00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,352
It's a nice setup.
Mayfield's a known killer.

00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:01,320
He's a perfect patsy.

00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,321
I didn't do it.

00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:04,723
I swear.

00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,593
Cops don't have their DNA
in CODIS,

00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:09,128
so if you want to prove it
to me, you're gonna

00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,329
have to give me a sample.

00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,234
Hey. You find anything

00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:16,735
on the recording device
from Grady's cell?

00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,070
No, it's blank.

00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,205
(sighs)
We must've found it

00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,640
before Grady had a
chance to use it.

00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,742
Yeah, but here's
where it gets weird.

00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:26,111
So, I got the specs
from the vendor.

00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,714
Something isn't adding up here.

00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,582
According to these,

00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:32,484
the dynamic range of the device

00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,287
is 80 decibels, with
a noise floor of 30 decibels.

00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:38,257
Dynamic range? Noise floor?

00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:40,058
All right. Well,
let-let me just show you.

00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,728
So, the human speaking
voice averages

00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,396
60 to 70 decibels

00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,165
at three feet. That's...

00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,533
the green wave here.

00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,102
Now let's add
some interference.

00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:52,471
(white noise hissing)

00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:54,373
So as long
as the interference

00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:56,108
from any kind
of background noise stays

00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:57,442
within this range,

00:27:57,442 --> 00:28:00,279
then the recording device
can still pick up our voices.

00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,181
See how the green
and red waves

00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,383
remain distinct?
But in
the jail's laundry,

00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:06,618
with all the machines
running and the cement walls,

00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,421
the noise interference level
would have to be a lot higher.

00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,758
I went back and measured.
It was 86 decibels.

00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:15,394
(hissing, crackling increases)

00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:15,891
See?

00:28:15,891 --> 00:28:18,463
Now look at the sound waves.
The laundry room's
way too loud

00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,432
to record human conversation
with that.

00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,201
(hissing, crackling fades)

00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:26,271
So if the FBI was trying
to record Officer Woo

00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,273
during his shift
in the jail laundry,

00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:31,109
then this was the wrong device.

00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,047
So, Morgan and Greg
don't think

00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,616
Officer Woo is the target
of the FBI investigation.

00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:40,085
I think they're right.
Woo's DNA did not

00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,054
match the DNA
on the neck swab.

00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,389
So Woo's not the one
who strangled Grady.

00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,090
Mm-mm.

00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,259
Where's that put us now?

00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:50,229
Well, I have been looking back
over Grady's CI files,

00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,496
and instead of links

00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:54,299
to inmates, I've been looking
at links to officers,

00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,968
and there's quite a list.

00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:58,637
Grady has been making deals
for years.

00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:00,672
Well, being an informant
can be good money.

00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:01,707
Well, he's not doing it
for the money.

00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:04,643
He's doing it to get his
charges reduced, so...

00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:09,147
sexual assault is dealt down
to malicious mischief

00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,550
and robbery down to burglary.

00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,118
And the list
just goes on and on.

00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:15,220
Is there a connection
to any officers that we know?

00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,992
Carl Brenner.

00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,627
Brenner?

00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:24,062
The gung-ho detective?

00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,098
He never mentioned anything

00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,033
about knowing Grady
at the crime scene.

00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:31,336
Hey, wait a minute,

00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:36,108
was Detective Brenner a part
of the Lincoln Mayfield case?

00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:42,748
FINLAY:
He was.

00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,384
And Brenner would have been
in charge

00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:48,120
of putting Grady into the cell
next to Mayfield.

00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,255
When I talked to Mayfield,
he claims

00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:52,324
that he never talked to Grady
about anything

00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:53,725
when they were housed next
to each other.

00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,460
So what if

00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,631
Brenner fed his informant
the information on Mayfield?

00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:01,199
There was a lot
of public pressure

00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,567
at the time for a conviction.

00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:05,237
Right? Perfect opportunity
for the new guy in Homicide

00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:06,538
to make a name for himself.

00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:10,208
What are you doing?

00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:13,312
Looking up Detective Brenner's
personnel file.

00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:14,479
You know, when officers

00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,448
take a random drug test,
they have to list

00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:18,317
all the medications
they've been taking.

00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,751
Yeah, yeah.
That's routine.

00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,254
Right. Here's his medical

00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:24,623
disclosure form
from last month.

00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:27,326
He lists a multivitamin,
ibuprofen...

00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:30,696
...and terbinafine.

00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:33,598
Same medication
we found in Grady's blood.

00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:34,599
Wow.

00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,369
So Brenner was poisoning Grady.
Yeah.

00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:39,504
How much you want to bet he's
the one who strangled him, too?

00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:48,180
Okay, here's what we got:

00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,449
Detective Brenner
was using Grady

00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:53,552
by feeding him case information
and then putting him

00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:56,288
next to suspects
that he wanted to frame.

00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:58,156
Making Brenner look like a hero.

00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:00,158
Right.
Explains his
meteoric rise

00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,027
in the department
over the last two years.

00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,096
Mayfield
was the most recent.

00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:05,997
Also the highest profile.

00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,166
And that may be what got
the attention of the Feds.

00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,035
Brenner's a smart guy.

00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,336
Probably saw it coming.

00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,605
Started to poison Grady.

00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:17,008
Was Brenner at County
at the time Grady was strangled?

00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,246
Conducting a lineup
down the hall from the laundry.

00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:25,150
I'm gonna interrogate
this son of a bitch myself.

00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:35,093
I thought we
agreed to talk

00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,028
before pulling
the trigger on this.
Mitch.

00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,563
Take Detective Brenner

00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,265
to Interrogation Room B.

00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,466
Be my pleasure, sir.

00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,168
Let's go.

00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,569
Special Agent Parker,

00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,072
what we agreed was
to work our cases separately,

00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,741
at yourrequest, as I recall.
Arresting Brenner

00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,209
could affect
our grand jury hearing,

00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,311
damage our case going forward.

00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,614
Not my problem.
We have our own case to solve.

00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:58,150
We could work together.

00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,653
The LVPD is under
no obligation

00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,655
to share investigative
information with you.

00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:06,758
You want a shot at Brenner,
you can wait till I'm done.

00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,726
Excuse me.

00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,497
Sheriff...

00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,065
Sir, look...

00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,067
I don't know what
you've heard, all right?

00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,103
But-but I am
a good cop, okay?

00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,504
I can't believe
you march me in here

00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,239
like-like some... criminal.

00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,641
I put criminals away.
Yeah, you do.

00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:25,243
You got a hell of
a conviction rate, one of
the best in the department.

00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:27,379
And now every single one
of those convictions

00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:28,680
is gonna be called
into question.

00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,082
Aw, come on.
Every dirtbag I put away

00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:32,484
was guilty, no question.

00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:33,985
You falsified evidence

00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:36,488
by coaching your informant
to lie in court.

00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:40,091
So I <i>nudged</i> my cases
a little bit-- so what?

00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:42,594
You <i>framed</i> them.
Going down that road,

00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:43,695
you become worse
than the criminals

00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,096
you're chasing.
No. No.

00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:47,365
I could <i>never</i> be like them.
You already are.

00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:48,567
You killed Bruce Grady.

00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:49,968
The hell I did.

00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,070
He had poisonous medicine
in his system.

00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,971
Your medicine.

00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,212
(chuckles):
Okay, yeah.

00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:01,713
(sniffs)
Yeah, I gave him the medicine.

00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:06,218
<i>But to make him sick,</i>
<i>not-not to... to kill him.</i>

00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:07,986
<i>Look, Grady was getting</i>

00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,554
<i>cold feet</i>
<i>about Mayfield's retrial.</i>

00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:12,524
<i>I figure if he's too sick</i>
<i>to testify, the DA's forced</i>

00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:13,992
<i>to use his previous testimony.</i>

00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,696
No, you killed him because
you knew he was two-timing you.

00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:19,531
What-what are you talking about?

00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21,233
With the FBI investigation.

00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:25,971
Grady was ratting you out
to the Feds, and you found out.

00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:27,239
That's why
you killed him.

00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:31,443
Okay, I-I, um...
I need my-my union rep.

00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:32,644
(chuckles):
Your union rep.

00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:35,413
You've committed
multiple felonies while on duty.

00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:38,049
Your union is gonna run
in the opposite direction.

00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,985
Well, then I want a lawyer.
(sniffs)

00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:42,053
You're gonna need one.

00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:45,323
RUSSELL:
<i>Hey.</i>

00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,224
How'd it go?

00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:48,760
Admitted to the poisoning,
denied the murder,

00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,728
then lawyered up.

00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:52,564
Funny thing, though,
from the look on his face,

00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:54,599
I don't think he knew
about the FBI probe.

00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,269
Did you get a DNA sample?

00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:59,371
No, and there's not a chance
he's gonna give one now.

00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,672
Actually, wait a minute.

00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:04,676
I think he may have
given it to me already.

00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:07,178
You need me, you call me.

00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:08,680
Home number's
right on the back.

00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:26,031
♪ ♪

00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,644
Henry, you look excited.

00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:42,247
Were you able
to extract any DNA?

00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:45,417
Oh, I got a beautiful profile,
but we're not gonna need it.

00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,485
Well, yeah, we are.

00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:50,555
Brenner only admitted
to poisoning Grady--

00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,657
we need to prove
that he also strangled him.

00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,559
Uh, except he didn't.

00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,096
(sighs)
Okay. What am I missing?

00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,532
I found a match to the neck swab
from the victim.

00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:02,567
The killer's an inmate

00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:03,969
named Peter McCrone.

00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:07,172
This is the guy
that got punched

00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:09,274
during that pepper spray melee.

00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,575
Hey, what the hell?

00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:14,479
He's an inmate, so how come
his DNA didn't show up in CODIS?

00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,449
Oh, only DNA from felons gets
entered into CODIS.

00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,417
Peter McCrone is in county
on a misdemeanor.

00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,553
We just got his DNA when
Finlay interviewed him.

00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:23,421
It was at the bottom
of a big pile of...

00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:24,422
Hey, come on in.

00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,223
FINLAY:
Hey.

00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:28,226
Henry just found a match
to an inmate you talked to.

00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,394
Yeah, Peter McCrone.

00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:30,462
Henry texted me.

00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,764
So, I went back to try
to find a connection

00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,299
between McCrone and Grady.

00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,266
Right. And?

00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:38,536
Grady's earliest arrest was
for sexual assault.

00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:40,972
Dealt down
to malicious mischief.

00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,307
Right, I remember seeing that.

00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,643
McCrone was his victim.

00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:48,680
Grady molested him 20 years ago.

00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:51,583
Well, there's
a hell of a motive.

00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,487
You spend your whole life trying
to put things behind you.

00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:58,556
To forget.

00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,329
But some things,
they just never go away.

00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:07,766
STOKES:
I know it's difficult.

00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:12,103
So, tell me what happened.

00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:16,641
Bruce Grady was a janitor
at my elementary school.

00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,109
He was always nice.

00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,377
Seemed like someone
you could trust.

00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:21,012
But he broke that trust.

00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:25,483
One afternoon,
I forgot my backpack.

00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,486
Nobody here
except you and me, man.

00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:30,429
There it is!

00:36:30,429 --> 00:36:31,990
Thanks, Mr. Grady.

00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,763
Hey, kid, want to see
a cool picture of a T. rex?

00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:40,031
Sure.

00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,475
<i>He molested me.</i>

00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,410
<i>I was nine years old.</i>

00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,313
I never should have
gone near him.

00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,115
You know, I-I knew
something wasn't right.

00:36:57,115 --> 00:36:57,582
I knew.

00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:59,050
He took advantage of a child.

00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,085
That's not your fault.

00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:04,422
He threatened to hurt
my family... if I told.

00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:08,126
I wasn't going to,
but when I got home,

00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:11,996
my mom knew something was wrong.

00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:14,232
So, I had to tell her.

00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,201
You know, that's
a brave thing to do.

00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:19,037
Lot of kids, they wouldn't
even say anything.

00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:20,638
He was arrested the next day.

00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:23,108
And I was ready
to testify against him,

00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:24,275
so he couldn't hurt other kids.

00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,744
It was all I could think about.

00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,480
But Grady took a plea bargain.

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,248
He got three years.

00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,050
Three years, that's it.

00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,051
I couldn't believe it.

00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:36,254
How'd you run
into Grady in county?

00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,090
I was dropping supplies off
in the laundry.

00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,059
And I heard arguing.

00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:43,161
If you tell the DA
about our little talk,

00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:46,397
I'm gonna kill
you ugly...

00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,233
I swear, I won't tell anyone.

00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:49,634
I swear.

00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:52,537
Not a word.

00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:53,505
<i>That voice.</i>

00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:56,541
<i>I recognized it immediately.</i>

00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:00,078
Don't say a word.

00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:01,980
Not to anybody.

00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,449
Not one word.

00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,453
The bastard who raped me
was right there.

00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:12,423
So I waited for
the other guy to leave.

00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:18,997
You're Bruce Grady,
aren't you?

00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:21,199
Who's asking?

00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,600
Pete McCrone.

00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,469
We met 20 years ago.

00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:25,703
When I was a kid.

00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,205
Not ringing a bell.

00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:29,140
When you raped me.

00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:39,284
Figures you'd wind up in here.

00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,127
<i>Squeezed his neck</i>
<i>as hard as I could.</i>

00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:51,596
It surprised me.

00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:54,132
I didn't think I could do
something like that.

00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:56,234
Hmm, well, then what happened?

00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:57,168
I panicked.

00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,369
I stuffed him into the closet,

00:38:58,369 --> 00:38:59,437
I wiped up the blood,

00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,306
and I got hell out of there.

00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:05,543
What were you even
doing in County?

00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:09,147
I mean, the only charge
I see here is a misdemeanor.

00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:09,714
What the hell happened?

00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:11,583
It's stupid--
child endangerment.

00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:12,717
What do you mean?

00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:15,753
I left my two-year-old
at home in the crib,

00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:18,223
and I went and tried to pull
my wife out of the bar.

00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:20,325
While I was gone,
the neighbors called the cops.

00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:21,759
And that was a month ago.

00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,995
You haven't had
your arraignment yet?

00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:26,164
Public defender told me
he was handling things.

00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:28,233
That I'd be out
in 24 hours.

00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:30,635
And then never heard anything.

00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,706
Hey, uh...

00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:37,308
maybe you could talk to someone.

00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:41,045
Get things straightened out,

00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,747
get me out of here.

00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:48,286
Pete, man, I just...

00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,055
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,625
You know, not-not now.

00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:55,460
After-after all this.

00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:11,676
Heard you got a confession
out of McCrone.

00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:13,678
Yeah.

00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,480
Yeah, he copped
to everything.

00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:18,283
He recognized Grady
20 years later?

00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:20,118
It was Grady's voice.

00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:22,020
That's what got him.

00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,322
Pete never forgot
that voice.

00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,125
Course, it was
a million-to-one shot

00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:29,460
that McCrone'd even run into
Grady there in the first place.

00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,062
Yeah, why was he in jail again?

00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:32,196
Child endangerment?

00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:33,698
Yeah, those charges
were dropped.

00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:39,170
It was paperwork that kept him
in there for that month.

00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:43,207
How you doing? You okay?

00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,110
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,647
Hey, seriously.

00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:53,751
Sometimes these cases
hit a nerve, you know?

00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,521
And... this one just hit a nerve

00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:58,523
that was a little too close
to home for me, that's all.

00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:00,558
You want to talk about it?

00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,497
No, I want to forget about it.

00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,336
Okay.

00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,671
Well...

00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:17,308
this is a hell
of a job, Nick.

00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:21,279
We work a horrific crime,

00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:25,283
turn around and
work another one.

00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:27,485
They're bound to collide

00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,388
with our personal lives,
sooner or later.

00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,390
Just never know when.

00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,194
Pete did the exact same thing
I would have done

00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:37,261
in that situation.

00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:41,699
Think you would have
gone that far?

00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:52,410
Guy goes to jail
for a misdemeanor,

00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,379
ends up in prison for murder.

00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,982
Momentary decision...

00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,685
ruined his life forever.

00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:07,058
His life was ruined
a long time ago.
