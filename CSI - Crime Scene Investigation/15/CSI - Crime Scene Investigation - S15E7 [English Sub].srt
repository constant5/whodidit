00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:33,454
PHILLIPS:
All right, fellas.

00:01:37,161 --> 00:01:39,098
Well, looks like somebody went
for a little skinny-dip,

00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,670
and things didn't go so well
last night, huh? Thanks, boys.

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,743
House has been on the
market for a couple months.

00:01:44,743 --> 00:01:45,745
Just been sitting
here vacant.

00:01:45,745 --> 00:01:48,784
Neighbors say they see
kids hop the fence,

00:01:48,784 --> 00:01:50,421
use the pool,
all the time.

00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:52,325
But nobody saw anything
last night?

00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:54,463
Right.

00:01:54,463 --> 00:01:57,234
Hey, Akers, do we even know
who she is, yet?

00:01:57,234 --> 00:01:58,771
AKERS: No, not yet.
There's no I.D.

00:01:58,771 --> 00:02:00,775
There's no car out front.
We knocked on doors.

00:02:00,775 --> 00:02:02,479
She's not from the neighborhood.

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,750
STOKES:
She got here somehow.

00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,887
Maybe she came with a friend,
and that friend took off.

00:02:06,887 --> 00:02:09,526
I don't know if "friend,"
is the word I'd use.

00:02:09,526 --> 00:02:13,734
There are bruises, looks like
finger marks, on her neck.

00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,705
Take a look at this.

00:02:15,705 --> 00:02:18,344
Got skin underneath
her fingernails.

00:02:18,344 --> 00:02:19,880
She struggled.

00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,784
Possibly while being
held under water.

00:02:23,854 --> 00:02:26,360
Yeah, hang-hang on a second.

00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,633
Greg, let me borrow
your mini-UV for a second.

00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:32,806
Hold up that wrist for me.
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:36,847
There we go, Greg, look at that.

00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:38,617
(camera shutter clicks)

00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,888
Club bracelets and hand stamps.

00:02:40,888 --> 00:02:43,360
Well, party didn't start here.

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,832
Looks like she made
the rounds last night.

00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,535
Partied like there was
no tomorrow.

00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:50,241

Wow, she's so young.

00:03:37,535 --> 00:03:38,837
What a waste.

00:03:38,837 --> 00:03:41,810
Did you collect
a sexual assault kit?

00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,217
Yes, evidence of recent
sexual activity.

00:03:45,217 --> 00:03:46,720
Can't say for certain
that it was forced,

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,989
but it was certainly

00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:48,958
aggressive.

00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,330
No semen, though.
Doesn't rule out rape.

00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,569
Just means that her attacker was
smart enough to use a condom.

00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,306
Any clue who
she might be, yet?

00:03:56,306 --> 00:03:58,243
Still a Jane Doe.

00:03:58,243 --> 00:04:00,514
But... trashy clothes,

00:04:00,514 --> 00:04:01,883
lots of costume jewelry.

00:04:01,883 --> 00:04:03,587
May have been a sex worker.

00:04:03,587 --> 00:04:05,558
You don't know much
about women's clothes, huh?

00:04:05,558 --> 00:04:09,933
These "trashy shoes"
go for about, uh, 1,200 bucks.

00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:10,935
What?

00:04:10,935 --> 00:04:12,338
Yep.

00:04:12,338 --> 00:04:13,941
And this... yeah.

00:04:13,941 --> 00:04:15,945
I saw that upstairs
at the Mediterranean.

00:04:15,945 --> 00:04:17,348
Two grand, on sale.

00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:18,016
For that little thing?

00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:19,719
Yeah, this girl had
a lot of money.

00:04:20,354 --> 00:04:22,458
Yeah, or somebody willing
to spend it on her.

00:04:23,327 --> 00:04:24,763
Well, uh, if
that's the case...

00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,769
...this thing might
actually be real.

00:04:28,837 --> 00:04:29,873
Wow.

00:04:29,873 --> 00:04:32,578
That is a very big rock.

00:04:32,578 --> 00:04:33,514
It's probably insured,

00:04:33,514 --> 00:04:36,620
which means it might have
a serial number etched on it.

00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,257
SANDERS:
It's real, all right.

00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:39,859
Nearly flawless.

00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:41,263
Yeah?

00:04:41,263 --> 00:04:42,432
How big is it?

00:04:42,432 --> 00:04:44,269
Well, now, I thought
size doesn't matter.

00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:45,271
Well, you
thought wrong.

00:04:45,271 --> 00:04:46,273
Come on, how big?

00:04:46,273 --> 00:04:47,975
It's nearly
four karats.

00:04:47,975 --> 00:04:48,977
Wow.

00:04:48,977 --> 00:04:50,581
I don't see
any etching, though.

00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,885
No serial number
or I.D. markings.

00:04:52,885 --> 00:04:54,956
So, it's not gonna help
us I.D. our victim.

00:04:54,956 --> 00:04:56,426
You know, there are other ways

00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:58,363
to identify a diamond
these days.

00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,505
There, see that?

00:05:02,505 --> 00:05:04,709
You mean the
refraction pattern?

00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:05,744
Yeah.

00:05:05,744 --> 00:05:07,582
That pattern is unique
to that stone.

00:05:08,884 --> 00:05:10,321
Like a fingerprint.

00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:11,990
And it can be registered
with an insurance database.

00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,927
We just have to see

00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:15,531
if this particular pattern
is in the system.

00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:20,875
(whirring)

00:05:24,816 --> 00:05:27,021
(beeping)

00:05:27,021 --> 00:05:31,998
Diamond is registered
to Martin Fox, St. George, Utah.

00:05:38,777 --> 00:05:40,047
That's my wife.

00:05:40,915 --> 00:05:42,752
You know, the whole
drive down here,

00:05:42,752 --> 00:05:44,355
I was hoping it was
just a mistake.

00:05:45,724 --> 00:05:48,664
Who did this to her,
Mr. Russell?

00:05:48,664 --> 00:05:50,100
At this point
in the investigation,

00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,405
we're not ready
to name any suspects.

00:05:52,405 --> 00:05:55,578
Can you at least
tell me how it happened?

00:05:55,578 --> 00:05:58,784
Mr. Fox, we need more time
to study the evidence

00:05:58,784 --> 00:06:00,054
before we can
actually...

00:06:00,054 --> 00:06:01,456
She was wasted, though,
wasn't she?

00:06:02,993 --> 00:06:04,829
That much you know.

00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:09,974
Your wife's blood-alcohol level
was twice the legal limit.

00:06:09,974 --> 00:06:12,545
And there's evidence of
several controlled substances

00:06:12,545 --> 00:06:13,814
in her system.

00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,388
Was there a man involved?

00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:20,394
Wouldn't be the first time.

00:06:20,394 --> 00:06:22,698
Daycia didn't like
to party alone.

00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:25,671
Mr. Fox, I'm very sorry
for your loss,

00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:28,110
but I-I'm not gonna give you
any details here.

00:06:29,512 --> 00:06:33,053
$8,000 a week.

00:06:33,053 --> 00:06:34,890
She was supposed
to be safe.

00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,660
Hell, she was supposed
to be getting better.

00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,965
What-what was $8,000 a week?

00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,836
Rehab.

00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:44,475
Daycia was in rehab,
here in Vegas.

00:06:44,475 --> 00:06:45,979
Three weeks already.

00:06:47,048 --> 00:06:49,052
(birds chirping)

00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:50,989
(vehicle approaching)

00:07:02,178 --> 00:07:03,747
This is rehab?

00:07:03,747 --> 00:07:04,482
Seriously?

00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:05,919
I'd be worried
about getting addicted

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,923
to living in a place like this.

00:07:07,923 --> 00:07:09,125
Well, maybe
that's the idea.

00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,129
You spend so much to stay here,

00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:13,667
you don't have any money left
to support your habit.

00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,537
You know, I checked out
their Web site.

00:07:15,537 --> 00:07:18,076
They claim to have one
of the highest success rates

00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:19,178
in the state.

00:07:19,178 --> 00:07:19,746
Really?

00:07:19,947 --> 00:07:21,616
Yeah, they're all
about pampering you

00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:25,491
in a setting of luxury,
harmony and serenity.

00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:27,863
They seem to have that covered.

00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:32,505
Don't tell me I don't care
about my children, Zach.

00:07:32,505 --> 00:07:34,142
They're the most important
thing in my life.

00:07:34,142 --> 00:07:34,877
Are they?

00:07:35,477 --> 00:07:36,847
'Cause it sounds to me
like you choose the pills

00:07:36,847 --> 00:07:38,483
over your kids
every time.

00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,220
Do I really have to sit
here and listen to this?

00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,224
From him?
I know it's hard
to hear what Zach

00:07:42,224 --> 00:07:44,762
has to say, Karen. But isn't
that the heart of the problem?

00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:47,903
The addiction takes
over your whole life.

00:07:47,903 --> 00:07:49,807
Pushes everything else out.

00:07:50,073 --> 00:07:52,913
Or you could keep denying it.
That's what I did.

00:07:52,913 --> 00:07:54,582
Until divorce papers

00:07:54,582 --> 00:07:57,221
and the threat of losing
my children opened my eyes.

00:07:57,756 --> 00:07:58,825
(doorbell rings)

00:08:00,494 --> 00:08:01,229
I got it.

00:08:04,937 --> 00:08:05,704
Hi there.

00:08:05,704 --> 00:08:07,809
I'm CSI Stokes.
This is Finlay.

00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:09,011
We're with the
police department.

00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:10,614
We'd like to ask you
a few questions

00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:12,251
if, uh, that's
all right.

00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:14,489
Oh, God, this is about Daycia,
isn't it?

00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:16,827
FINLAY:
I'm sorry, who are you?

00:08:16,827 --> 00:08:19,098
Adam King. I run Desert Peace.

00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,703
Daycia disappeared, she never
came home last night.

00:08:21,703 --> 00:08:23,139
How bad is it?

00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:25,077
It's as bad as it gets.

00:08:25,077 --> 00:08:26,079
She's dead.

00:08:27,615 --> 00:08:28,784
(sighs)

00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:31,256
We're gonna
have to take a break.

00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,668
This was Daycia's room.

00:08:38,637 --> 00:08:41,009
So...

00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:44,750
this is what eight grand
a week looks like.

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,919
Well, there's no reason

00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,655
that recovery
should be a punitive

00:08:47,655 --> 00:08:49,058
process.
We try to

00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:50,193
pamper our patients,

00:08:50,193 --> 00:08:53,533
make 'em feel as comfortable
as possible.

00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,903
STOKES: And, hey,
the longer they stay,

00:08:54,903 --> 00:08:55,905
the better, am I right?

00:08:55,905 --> 00:08:58,844
In a clinical sense, yes.

00:08:58,844 --> 00:09:01,215
But I get a feeling that's
not what you're implying.

00:09:13,941 --> 00:09:16,012
When was the last
time you saw Daycia?

00:09:16,012 --> 00:09:17,147
Right about 9:00
last night.

00:09:17,147 --> 00:09:19,686
She was in the kitchen
getting something to eat.

00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:21,824
Must've ducked out
sometime after that.

00:09:21,824 --> 00:09:23,059
What do you mean,
"ducked out"?

00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:25,130
Is that typical
of the care around here?

00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,904
There's no such thing as typical
care here at Desert Peace.

00:09:28,904 --> 00:09:31,542
Each patient receives
a personalized treatment plan.

00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:33,146
And did Daycia
have a personalized

00:09:33,146 --> 00:09:36,019
treatment plan that allowed her
to go out and get wasted?

00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:38,758
What would you
have me do, Mr. Stokes?

00:09:38,758 --> 00:09:40,595
Keep an eye
on her, for one.
They're not

00:09:40,595 --> 00:09:42,297
locked up--
patients are here by choice.

00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:44,903
I can't force people
to stay here.

00:09:44,903 --> 00:09:46,039
Especially someone like Daycia.

00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:48,243
What is that
supposed to mean?

00:09:48,243 --> 00:09:50,948
She was already skittish
about getting clean.

00:09:50,948 --> 00:09:52,719
If I'd have clamped down
on her--

00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:54,790
if I would have
imposed restrictions--

00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,061
she would've just checked
herself out of here, and I would

00:09:57,061 --> 00:09:58,898
have had no chance
at trying to help her.

00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,835
And no chance at getting
that eight grand.

00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:03,239
So did
anybody else

00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:05,243
duck out last night?
Any of the other patients?

00:10:05,243 --> 00:10:06,714
No.

00:10:06,714 --> 00:10:09,085
Zach, Len and Karen
were all here.

00:10:09,085 --> 00:10:11,255
You know, they're committed
to getting sober.

00:10:11,255 --> 00:10:12,859
So you're saying
that Daycia wasn't?

00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:14,863
Daycia was here 'cause
her husband put her here.

00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:16,332
Not because she wanted
to get better.

00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:18,069
And I'm not saying that
as a knock. I flunked

00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:21,209
out of six rehabs myself before
I took getting sober seriously.

00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:23,113
As a straight numbers game,

00:10:23,113 --> 00:10:26,854
most addicts end up like Daycia.

00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:30,227
BRODY:
It's a hand stamp of a crown.

00:10:30,227 --> 00:10:31,663
Can't you just tell me

00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:34,636
if you guys used
a crown stamp last night?

00:10:35,872 --> 00:10:38,243
How is that a
proprietary secret?

00:10:38,243 --> 00:10:39,913
(chuckles) Do you even know
what "proprietary" means?

00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:41,082
(line clicks)

00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:42,752
Hello?

00:10:42,752 --> 00:10:45,691
That maybe didn't go as well
as I might have liked.

00:10:45,691 --> 00:10:48,831
Trying to figure out which clubs
our victim was at last night?

00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:50,902
BRODY: So far, I have it
narrowed down to four.

00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:52,906
Beautiful young girl
out by herself

00:10:52,906 --> 00:10:54,709
getting more and more impaired?

00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:57,682
<i>Truth is, the killer</i>
<i>could have spotted her anywhere</i>

00:10:57,682 --> 00:10:59,118
<i>along the way</i>
<i>and decided to follow her.</i>

00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:02,224
BRODY: <i>And the problem is,</i>
<i>she went to so many places,</i>

00:11:02,224 --> 00:11:04,963
<i>who knows how many hundreds</i>
<i>of people she met?</i>

00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:08,971
Hey. You got
something for us?

00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:11,242
I've been working on extracting
the DNA from the tissue

00:11:11,242 --> 00:11:12,645
found under
the victim's fingernails.

00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:14,916
Please tell me
you found a match.

00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,187
I wish I could, but no-- the DNA

00:11:17,187 --> 00:11:18,724
in the sample
was degraded,

00:11:18,724 --> 00:11:20,026
probably from
soaking in the pool.

00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:20,995
I was only able

00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:22,164
to type four loci.

00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:23,801
It's not enough
to enter into CODIS.

00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:25,805
RUSSELL:
No CODIS match.

00:11:25,805 --> 00:11:27,407
You've got your work
cut out for you.

00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:29,446
(chuckles)
Yes, I do.

00:11:30,748 --> 00:11:31,850
I started without you.

00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:32,986
I hope you don't mind.

00:11:32,986 --> 00:11:34,121
No problem.

00:11:34,121 --> 00:11:35,758
Only reason I called down

00:11:35,758 --> 00:11:37,695
was to see if you'd found
anything yet.

00:11:37,695 --> 00:11:39,365
Well, so far,
no surprises.

00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,237
All indications are
she was a longtime drinker

00:11:42,237 --> 00:11:43,941
and drug user.

00:11:43,941 --> 00:11:45,711
As good as she looks
on the outside,

00:11:45,711 --> 00:11:48,116
her insides paint a
different picture.

00:11:48,116 --> 00:11:49,920
Get a chance to look
at the finger marks

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,690
on the back of her neck?
I did.

00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,293
Definitely perimortem.

00:11:53,293 --> 00:11:55,965
Consistent with someone
holding her underwater.

00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,202
Lungs tell
the same story.

00:11:58,202 --> 00:12:00,106
They're heavy.

00:12:01,275 --> 00:12:03,380
They're filled with water.

00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,116
Telltale sign she drowned.

00:12:06,052 --> 00:12:07,054
(sniffing)

00:12:08,256 --> 00:12:10,962
Greg, the pool
you found her in--

00:12:10,962 --> 00:12:12,732
chlorine or saline?

00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,301
Uh, it was chlorine. Why?

00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:15,303
(sniffs)

00:12:22,485 --> 00:12:24,088
If you get any closer,

00:12:24,088 --> 00:12:26,158
you can literally be
breathing down my neck.

00:12:26,158 --> 00:12:27,729
You wish.

00:12:27,729 --> 00:12:29,399
So, what is going on
with the pool water

00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,768
from our victim's lungs?

00:12:30,768 --> 00:12:32,905
Greg said that there was
some sort of an issue.

00:12:32,905 --> 00:12:34,809
I don't think
that it is pool water.

00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:36,145
Certainly doesn't
match any

00:12:36,145 --> 00:12:38,082
of the samples that
Nick brought in.

00:12:38,082 --> 00:12:39,319
pH is about the same,

00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:41,423
but the chlorine level
is far too low.

00:12:41,423 --> 00:12:43,794
More in line
with regular tap water.

00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:45,531
What did the GCMS find?

00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:46,767
Oh, perfect timing.
(printer whirring)

00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:47,267
Let's take a look.

00:12:51,476 --> 00:12:54,114
Traces of sodium
myreth sulfate,

00:12:54,114 --> 00:12:56,118
panthenol,
methyl glycinate.

00:12:56,118 --> 00:12:57,889
All ingredients in soap.

00:12:57,889 --> 00:12:59,359
What is the organic oil?

00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:02,865
Extract of
<i>Lavandula augustifolia.</i>

00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:04,769
Lavender.

00:13:05,271 --> 00:13:08,310
The fluid in the victim's
lungs was bathwater.

00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:13,487
Yep.

00:13:13,487 --> 00:13:15,324
The ingredients are
an exact match

00:13:15,324 --> 00:13:17,962
to what was in the
water in her lungs.

00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:19,164
You guys can't just come
barging in here.

00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:21,001
Yeah, that warrant
in your hand says we can.

00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,872
We have every right in the world
to search the crime scene.

00:13:22,872 --> 00:13:23,907
Crime scene?

00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:25,043
What are you talking about?

00:13:25,043 --> 00:13:27,348
Daycia did not drown
in any pool.

00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,419
She was killed
right here.

00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:38,035
♪ ♪

00:13:41,075 --> 00:13:43,146
BRODY:
Hi.

00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:44,883
So, I've been calling
cab companies.

00:13:44,883 --> 00:13:47,187
Talked to a dispatcher
who's got a driver

00:13:47,187 --> 00:13:49,993
who dropped off a fare
last night at this address.

00:13:49,993 --> 00:13:51,162
3:00 a.m.

00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:53,132
A couple--
man and a woman.

00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,136
So Daycia brought
her killer home.

00:13:55,136 --> 00:13:58,109
Okay, so... they came
in here at 3:00 a.m.

00:13:58,109 --> 00:14:01,216
Daycia, as we know,
is messed up on pills.

00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:03,820
And then they ended
up in the tub.

00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,424
You know, maybe she...

00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:07,060
maybe she refused
his sexual advances,

00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,365
or... the sex got
out of control?

00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:10,367
Either way...

00:14:11,469 --> 00:14:13,407
<i>...he ends up drowning her.</i>

00:14:13,407 --> 00:14:15,611
(muffled screaming)

00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:17,281
Yeah, but look around.

00:14:17,281 --> 00:14:20,254
The tub, the towels--
everything's clean and dry.

00:14:20,254 --> 00:14:21,856
It's like nothing ever happened.

00:14:21,856 --> 00:14:24,562
So, after Daycia was dead,
he cleaned up.

00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,102
<i>Took her body out of the tub,</i>
<i>and then erased</i>

00:14:28,102 --> 00:14:30,106
<i>any sign that they had ever</i>
<i>been here at all.</i>

00:14:30,106 --> 00:14:32,478
If they came here in a cab,

00:14:32,478 --> 00:14:34,515
how did the killer
get Daycia's body

00:14:34,515 --> 00:14:37,120
all the way to the pool,
which is over a mile away?

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,423
That's a good question.

00:14:38,423 --> 00:14:40,261
In the meantime,
the cab company is trying

00:14:40,261 --> 00:14:42,531
to locate the driver,
and we got to figure out

00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:44,269
where the evidence
from this room ended up.

00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:45,537
All right, I'm
gonna go talk

00:14:45,537 --> 00:14:47,040
to the other people
living here.

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,510
This is rehab--
nobody sleeps--

00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,981
so I'm sure somebody
saw something.

00:14:50,981 --> 00:14:52,118
Let's hope.

00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:55,124
I was up the whole night,

00:14:55,124 --> 00:14:59,465
crawling between hot showers
to stop the chills

00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:03,273
and hugging the toilet
and puking my guts out.

00:15:03,273 --> 00:15:05,043
I didn't hear anything.

00:15:05,043 --> 00:15:07,982
I wish I would have, you know,
heard something.

00:15:07,982 --> 00:15:11,089
Maybe I could have tried
to help her.

00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:13,193
I was watching a movie
on my laptop,

00:15:13,193 --> 00:15:14,662
and I had my headphones in.

00:15:14,662 --> 00:15:16,599
THERAPIST:
<i>So many addicts.</i>

00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:19,305
They can be really nice people,
but when they're using,

00:15:19,305 --> 00:15:21,276
they make some
very poor choices.

00:15:21,276 --> 00:15:25,451
Daycia was young
and immature and...

00:15:25,451 --> 00:15:27,388
let her addiction
cloud her judgment.

00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:30,661
Look, to me, Daycia
was never gonna get clean,

00:15:30,661 --> 00:15:32,298
'cause she didn't have to.

00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,404
No matter what, she had a rich
husband waiting for her at home.

00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:37,375
You know, you... you're just
never gonna hit rock bottom

00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,412
if you got a safety net
like that.

00:15:39,412 --> 00:15:42,284
This is really messing
with my head.

00:15:43,553 --> 00:15:46,292
I came here to get healthy.

00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:47,695
This is not what I needed.

00:15:47,695 --> 00:15:48,964
You know, last night
wasn't the first night

00:15:48,964 --> 00:15:50,167
that she went out
drinking and partying.

00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:51,603
She pretty much went
partying and shopping

00:15:51,603 --> 00:15:53,573
any time she felt like it.

00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:58,016
I was against giving her
so much latitude, but...

00:15:58,016 --> 00:15:58,717
Adam's the boss.

00:15:59,018 --> 00:16:01,156
I have to get sober this time.

00:16:01,156 --> 00:16:02,358
I don't have a choice.

00:16:02,358 --> 00:16:04,228
The stakes...

00:16:04,228 --> 00:16:06,733
the stakes are just too high.

00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:09,672
If I fail...

00:16:09,672 --> 00:16:12,378
I lose my kids.

00:16:12,378 --> 00:16:16,252
My biggest concern was Daycia's
effect on the other patients.

00:16:16,252 --> 00:16:18,256
She was toxic in that way.

00:16:18,256 --> 00:16:19,592
This sucks.

00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:22,231
I can't believe she did this.

00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,467
Frankly, if it'd been up to me,

00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:25,103
she never would have
been in here.

00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,579
Hey.

00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:32,017
So, this is the cab
that brought our victim

00:16:32,017 --> 00:16:33,553
home this morning.
Okay.

00:16:33,553 --> 00:16:36,226
Now, if it was the killer
that rode with her,

00:16:36,226 --> 00:16:39,499
then hopefully he left us
some kind of trace.

00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,534
Yeah, hopefully,
'cause I just

00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:41,703
got done talking
with the driver.

00:16:41,703 --> 00:16:43,673
Give you a description?
No, not really.

00:16:43,673 --> 00:16:44,742
The only thing
he could remember

00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:46,346
is that the guy
was a white male.

00:16:46,346 --> 00:16:47,448
Probably couldn't take his eye

00:16:47,448 --> 00:16:49,418
off the pretty girl
the whole time.

00:16:49,418 --> 00:16:52,691
Yeah, probably. Did say she
was in pretty rough shape,

00:16:52,691 --> 00:16:56,566
but he didn't think she
was in any real danger.

00:16:56,566 --> 00:16:58,003
I'm sure she didn't
think so, either.

00:16:58,003 --> 00:16:59,672
Till the last second.

00:16:59,672 --> 00:17:01,009
Give me a call
if you find something.

00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:01,543
Okay.

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:13,800
I've seen, uh,

00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,504
plenty of people
Dumpster-dive before,

00:17:15,504 --> 00:17:17,274
but they never made
it look so good.

00:17:17,274 --> 00:17:19,278
Why don't you let me
get that for you?

00:17:19,278 --> 00:17:20,414
It's Zach, right?

00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,184
It'd be better if you
didn't touch anything.

00:17:22,184 --> 00:17:23,186
Ah, yes.

00:17:23,186 --> 00:17:24,288
Evidence.

00:17:24,288 --> 00:17:25,691
Uh, I just wanted to help.

00:17:25,691 --> 00:17:27,061
You want to help?

00:17:27,061 --> 00:17:29,198
You could tell me about Daycia.

00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:31,536
We think she may have brought
a guy home last night.

00:17:31,536 --> 00:17:32,438
Sounds like she's quite
the party girl.

00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:33,607
May have not been
the first time.

00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:34,642
You ever see her with anybody?

00:17:34,642 --> 00:17:37,247
Ah, here at the house, no.

00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:38,717
But somewhere else,

00:17:38,717 --> 00:17:40,454
with someone?

00:17:40,454 --> 00:17:44,128
Well, don't tell
Twyla, but, uh...

00:17:44,128 --> 00:17:46,532
I let Daycia talk me into
going out one night.

00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,637
See, one of the things
you got to know

00:17:48,637 --> 00:17:50,173
about me is, pretty women,

00:17:50,173 --> 00:17:52,444
they're like my kryptonite,
you know?

00:17:52,444 --> 00:17:54,782
Maybe my deadliest
of addictions.

00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,252
So you went clubbing

00:17:56,252 --> 00:17:58,590
and you saw her hook up
with somebody.

00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,129
There was this guy
at one of the clubs,

00:18:01,129 --> 00:18:03,333
this cowboy who
was watching her.

00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,602
Older guy.

00:18:04,602 --> 00:18:06,472
I didn't think much of it,
because with Daycia,

00:18:06,472 --> 00:18:08,143
all the guys watched
her, you know?

00:18:08,143 --> 00:18:10,714
Little while later, I went
to the bar to get a drink,

00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,386
and when I came
back, I saw Daycia

00:18:13,386 --> 00:18:16,092
heading out the door with
this guy, the cowboy.

00:18:16,092 --> 00:18:18,831
So she just picked up
and left, just like that?

00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:19,866
She was in group
the next morning.

00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:22,171
She didn't mention it.
I didn't, either.

00:18:22,171 --> 00:18:23,339
Never came up again.

00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:24,542
(sighing):
Well...

00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:26,079
I'm gonna get this run in.

00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,414
Got to clear my head.

00:18:27,414 --> 00:18:29,485
All this talk of
bars and women--

00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:31,824
start tugging me in the
wrong direction, you know?

00:18:31,824 --> 00:18:34,763
Well, I may need to talk
to you again later.

00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:36,666
Just, uh, take
it easy on me.

00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,670
Remember what I said
about kryptonite.

00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,340
How could I forget?

00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,411
Wow.

00:18:48,189 --> 00:18:50,560
(dog barking in distance)

00:19:04,555 --> 00:19:06,692
Huh.

00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:08,129
Bingo.

ANDREWS:
Hey.

00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,669
I've got slightly better
news than last time.

00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:36,773
I was able to pull DNA
from your bath towels.

00:20:36,773 --> 00:20:37,976
Two contributors.

00:20:37,976 --> 00:20:39,746
One the, uh, victim, I assume.

00:20:39,746 --> 00:20:40,781
What about the other?

00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,654
An unknown male, not in CODIS,
but this is interesting.

00:20:43,654 --> 00:20:47,962
The DNA from the towel
has the same four core loci

00:20:47,962 --> 00:20:49,966
as the DNA under
the victim's nails.

00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:52,437
Same unknown male-- our killer.

00:20:53,406 --> 00:20:56,479
Still no way to put
an I.D. to him.

00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:57,682
What are you working on here?

00:20:57,682 --> 00:20:59,485
These pieces of wax were found

00:20:59,485 --> 00:21:01,957
in the bag with the
rest of the evidence.

00:21:01,957 --> 00:21:04,796
I think it came
from this candle.

00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,432
Spilled while the wax
was still hot.

00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,438
The bottom's smooth,
like the rim of a bathtub.

00:21:09,438 --> 00:21:11,810
<i>I'm thinking the wax</i>

00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,881
<i>was knocked over</i>
<i>during the murder.</i>

00:21:13,881 --> 00:21:16,653
<i>After the wax hardened,</i>
<i>the killer used this lovely</i>

00:21:16,653 --> 00:21:19,559
<i>nail file to chip it up</i>
<i>and clean up the mess.</i>

00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,830
ANDREWS:
Looks like there's some kind
of impression there.

00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:25,403
Mm-hmm. I'm thinking it's
the killer's hand or arm.

00:21:25,403 --> 00:21:26,807
If I can get this whole thing
put together,

00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:28,877
I might be able to...
Hey, have you seen Nick?

00:21:28,877 --> 00:21:30,815
No, not recently.

00:21:30,815 --> 00:21:33,854
Well, I got AFIS results on the
lifts from the cab. Yours, too.

00:21:33,854 --> 00:21:36,760
They match a felony
DUI arrest from 2007.

00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,997
The guy's prints
were everywhere.

00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,835
Well, whose prints?

00:21:40,835 --> 00:21:42,337
Adam and I were
just talking

00:21:42,337 --> 00:21:43,707
about how we should
proceed in light

00:21:43,707 --> 00:21:46,312
of Daycia's death.
And we both agree

00:21:46,312 --> 00:21:48,717
that it would be detrimental
to your treatment

00:21:48,717 --> 00:21:51,490
if we were to shut down,
even for a little while.

00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,592
It's not
gonna be easy,

00:21:52,592 --> 00:21:53,660
but we need to...

00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,965
reestablish a sense
of normalcy...

00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:57,334
Hey, everybody.

00:21:58,637 --> 00:21:59,772
Knock, knock.

00:21:59,772 --> 00:22:01,710
And before you start
spouting off again,

00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,847
the answer's yes,
we have a warrant.

00:22:03,847 --> 00:22:05,684
Only this time
it's an arrest warrant.

00:22:05,684 --> 00:22:07,354
Oh, my God,
I don't believe this.

00:22:07,354 --> 00:22:08,724
What are you talking about?
Arrest?

00:22:08,724 --> 00:22:10,728
Hook him up, Akers.
Adam King,

00:22:10,728 --> 00:22:13,433
you're under arrest for the
murder of Daycia Fox. Put
your hands behind your back.

00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,905
Adam, what-what is this?
What's happening?

00:22:15,905 --> 00:22:17,441
I don't know.
It's a mistake.

00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:18,844
Hey, I didn't kill Daycia.

00:22:18,844 --> 00:22:20,848
You know that.

00:22:20,848 --> 00:22:22,718
Let's go.
You guys know that.

00:22:25,758 --> 00:22:27,862
This is ridiculous.
I didn't kill her.

00:22:27,862 --> 00:22:29,632
She was my patient.
I was helping her.

00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,605
Hey, do you hear me?
Yeah, yeah, I hear you.
And you'll have plenty of time

00:22:32,605 --> 00:22:35,911
to plead your case in court.
But right now... Mr. Fox?

00:22:35,911 --> 00:22:37,882
(gunshots)

00:22:37,882 --> 00:22:39,719
Down on your knees!

00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:41,756
Get down on the ground!

00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,598
(groaning)
Adam?

00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:46,600
Adam.

00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,637
Call the paramedics, Akers.
Call them.

00:22:48,637 --> 00:22:50,708
This is Officer Akers.
Roll paramedics to my location.

00:22:57,722 --> 00:22:59,525
Mr. Fox,

00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:03,500
I had you pegged as someone
with just a little more sense.

00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,838
Did you put any thought into
how this was gonna turn out?

00:23:05,838 --> 00:23:08,109
I trusted him.

00:23:10,381 --> 00:23:13,654
I took the thing most precious
in my life,

00:23:13,654 --> 00:23:16,493
and I put it
in Adam King's hands.

00:23:16,493 --> 00:23:18,830
He betrayed that trust.
So you...

00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,634
you just go and you shoot him?

00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:22,905
You know, you're lucky
you weren't shot yourself.

00:23:22,905 --> 00:23:24,942
And you're damn lucky you didn't
hit one of my officers.

00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:30,888
You didn't know Daycia,

00:23:30,888 --> 00:23:34,027
Mr. Russell.
I know you know about her,

00:23:34,027 --> 00:23:37,033
okay, her-her drinking
and partying

00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:38,870
and her-her struggles.

00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,843
You didn't know
the...

00:23:41,843 --> 00:23:46,686
the person that she was
before this...

00:23:46,686 --> 00:23:49,992
this-this sickness
took hold of her.

00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,165
Destroyed her.

00:23:54,902 --> 00:23:56,806
Destroyed everything.

00:23:59,144 --> 00:24:02,918
God's honest truth, I don't
much care what happens now.

00:24:07,495 --> 00:24:08,930
(door opens)

00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,834
FINLAY:
Uh, he shouldn't have those.

00:24:10,834 --> 00:24:12,772
He's a former drug addict.

00:24:12,772 --> 00:24:14,642
Painkillers probably aren't
a good idea, right, Adam?

00:24:14,642 --> 00:24:17,982
Guess you're just gonna
have to tough it out.

00:24:17,982 --> 00:24:19,919
Thank you.

00:24:23,192 --> 00:24:26,900
I know you think that
I'm some sort of monster,

00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,104
that I killed Daycia,
but you're wrong.

00:24:29,104 --> 00:24:31,609
This was taken
from a traffic cam

00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:33,447
about five blocks away
from the house

00:24:33,447 --> 00:24:35,851
where Daycia's
body was found.

00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:38,857
This is you,
about to dump Daycia's body.

00:24:38,857 --> 00:24:41,629
You want to tell me again
how you didn't kill her?

00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:44,469
I didn't.

00:24:44,469 --> 00:24:48,008
I only moved the body.

00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:50,881
From rehab to the swimming pool.
But she was dead already.

00:24:50,881 --> 00:24:52,050
I swear.
That is

00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,887
not even a good attempt
at a lie.

00:24:53,887 --> 00:24:55,657
We found your
fingerprints

00:24:55,657 --> 00:24:57,026
all over the taxicab.

00:24:57,026 --> 00:24:59,932
And, uh, you did clean up
the crime scene in the bathroom.

00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:01,736
Yeah, I know all that.

00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:03,907
Damn it, when Daycia didn't
come home that night,

00:25:03,907 --> 00:25:05,577
I went out looking
for her, all right?

00:25:05,577 --> 00:25:07,248
Not the first time
I had to hunt her down.

00:25:07,248 --> 00:25:09,886
After searching
a couple of clubs,

00:25:09,886 --> 00:25:11,589
I found her.

00:25:11,589 --> 00:25:14,060
And I brought her home
in the cab.

00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,230
I put her to bed.

00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,201
That still does not get us
to here, Adam.

00:25:17,201 --> 00:25:20,207
After a couple hours,
I went in to go check on her,

00:25:20,207 --> 00:25:21,976
to see if she was okay.

00:25:21,976 --> 00:25:23,914
<i>She wasn't in her bed.</i>

00:25:23,914 --> 00:25:25,217
<i>I found her in the tub.</i>

00:25:25,217 --> 00:25:27,053
Daycia. Daycia.

00:25:27,053 --> 00:25:29,090
No. No. No, no, no.

00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:33,833
<i>She was dead.</i>

00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:36,105
Look, I figured
she had just passed out,

00:25:36,105 --> 00:25:38,075
slipped under the water,
you know?

00:25:38,075 --> 00:25:39,779
That it was an accident.
You still

00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:41,816
should've called 911.
I should've.

00:25:41,816 --> 00:25:43,954
But I panicked.

00:25:46,225 --> 00:25:48,964
Daycia's wasn't the first death
at Desert Peace.

00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,233
We had an overdose

00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:52,671
eight months ago.

00:25:52,671 --> 00:25:54,542
The backlash on the clinic
was a nightmare.

00:25:54,542 --> 00:25:55,944
Oh, so that's why
you moved her body

00:25:55,944 --> 00:25:58,650
because you were afraid
of the backlash?

00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:02,324
Look, I had three other patients
that I had to think about,

00:26:02,324 --> 00:26:04,027
who are fighting
for their lives,

00:26:04,027 --> 00:26:06,633
who count on me.
So...

00:26:06,633 --> 00:26:09,639
I cleaned everything up
and moved the body.

00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:12,077
Made it look
like she was never home.

00:26:12,077 --> 00:26:13,913
FINLAY:
<i>He was telling the truth</i>

00:26:13,913 --> 00:26:15,851
about one thing.
Eight months ago,

00:26:15,851 --> 00:26:17,921
Desert Peace did have
a fatality.

00:26:17,921 --> 00:26:19,992
A female patient OD'd

00:26:19,992 --> 00:26:23,199
on sleeping pills.
So Adam, covering up
Daycia's death,

00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:25,103
was trying
to avoid bad PR

00:26:25,103 --> 00:26:27,908
and maybe a hike
in his insurance premiums,

00:26:27,908 --> 00:26:30,047
right?
The question is,
do we believe him

00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,184
when he says
he did not kill her?

00:26:32,184 --> 00:26:34,088
Well, personally,
I would not trust a word.

00:26:34,088 --> 00:26:36,125
But I did swab
him, and his DNA

00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:38,329
did not match what we have
on the bath towel

00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:41,235
or underneath the fingernails
of the victim.

00:26:41,235 --> 00:26:43,873
Which suggests he's not our guy.
So...

00:26:43,873 --> 00:26:45,343
what are we looking at?

00:26:45,343 --> 00:26:47,881
At some point between
the cab ride home

00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:49,952
and when Adam went
to check on her,

00:26:49,952 --> 00:26:52,891
someone else went into Daycia's
bathroom and killed her.

00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:57,301
♪ ♪

00:27:17,307 --> 00:27:19,345
Hey, Nick, it's a ring.

00:27:19,345 --> 00:27:21,315
The impression in the wax,

00:27:21,315 --> 00:27:23,286
it's two fingers and a ring.

00:27:23,286 --> 00:27:26,292
Daycia was wearing a diamond
ring when we found her.
No, no.

00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:29,165
It's not Daycia's ring.
It's something different.

00:27:29,165 --> 00:27:31,002
I think it's the killer's.

00:27:31,002 --> 00:27:32,771
STOKES:
You're right.

00:27:32,771 --> 00:27:34,074
That is a man's ring.

00:27:34,074 --> 00:27:35,410
Yeah, and it's got
an inscription on it,

00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,746
or at least
a tiny part of one.

00:27:36,746 --> 00:27:38,116
STOKES:
21, 12.

00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:39,351
Like a class ring.

00:27:39,351 --> 00:27:40,955
Or at least
that's what I was thinking.

00:27:40,955 --> 00:27:42,090
But then that's, like,
a hundred years in the future,

00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,092
so there's no way

00:27:43,092 --> 00:27:44,161
it could be
a class ring.

00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:45,363
Well, what if it's not the year?

00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,367
What if it's a... score?

00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:48,736
You know? From a game.

00:27:48,736 --> 00:27:49,805
21-12.

00:27:49,805 --> 00:27:51,375
Why would someone
put a score on a ring?

00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:52,811
If it's a championship ring,

00:27:52,811 --> 00:27:54,748
a lot of times
they'll put the score on there.

00:27:54,748 --> 00:27:56,219
Zach.

00:27:56,219 --> 00:27:59,225
Hmm?
Zach Alton, he's one of the
patients at the rehab center.

00:27:59,225 --> 00:28:01,997
He-he used to be a jock at WLVU.

00:28:01,997 --> 00:28:03,132
Football, I think.

00:28:03,132 --> 00:28:03,868
Let's see.

00:28:05,136 --> 00:28:06,439
Right here.

their conference championship.

I'm afraid I don't have
any good news for you.

00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:44,281
Your DNA was a match
to the DNA we found

00:28:44,281 --> 00:28:46,152
on the towels
in Daycia's bathroom.

00:28:46,152 --> 00:28:49,091
It was also a match to the DNA
we found under her fingernails,

00:28:49,091 --> 00:28:50,895
which is no surprise,

00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,431

So, as you can see,

tells the story here.

<i>One drink leads to another,</i>

<i>she brings out the pills and...</i>

00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:16,432
<i>I don't know, I guess</i>
<i>at that point I figured,</i>

00:30:16,432 --> 00:30:18,937
<i>might as well go all in.</i>

I woke up the

00:30:35,036 --> 00:30:36,338
by myself in my bed,

00:30:36,338 --> 00:30:39,913
and Daycia was nowhere around,
so...

00:30:39,913 --> 00:30:42,919
So you just went about your day?

00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:45,925
I had no idea I killed her.

00:30:45,925 --> 00:30:47,260
Unfortunately,

00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,899
that doesn't make it
any less of a crime.

00:30:55,076 --> 00:30:57,247
Got your text, Doc.
Why the 911?

00:30:57,247 --> 00:30:58,884
Just examining a tissue section

00:30:58,884 --> 00:31:01,088
from your drowning victim's
organs.

00:31:01,088 --> 00:31:02,157
Have a gander.

00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:09,504
SANDERS: What am I looking at?
Lung tissue,
specifically alveoli.

00:31:09,504 --> 00:31:12,410
They're the little sacs where
oxygen and CO2 are exchanged.

00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,114
They're blown,

00:31:14,114 --> 00:31:15,884
all popped like tiny balloons.
Well, why?

00:31:15,884 --> 00:31:17,554
What would cause that?
Well, normally

00:31:17,554 --> 00:31:20,260
I would say barotrauma.
You know, the bends.

00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,598
A diver ascends too fast,

00:31:22,598 --> 00:31:25,336
causing excess air pressure
in the lungs.

00:31:25,336 --> 00:31:28,476
Only the damage here was
caused by excess water pressure.

00:31:28,476 --> 00:31:31,348
From the drowning, right?
No, that's the problem.

00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,887
With drowning,
you don't generate pressure.

00:31:33,887 --> 00:31:36,458
Certainly not enough pressure
to pop the alveoli.

00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:39,632
<i>This young girl's lungs filled</i>
<i>with a rush of water</i>

00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:42,370
<i>with enough force</i>
<i>to cause the alveoli</i>

00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,876
<i>to expand</i>
<i>beyond their capacity.</i>

00:31:44,876 --> 00:31:46,278
So what are you saying happened?

00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:48,282
The only scenario
I can think of

00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:51,322
is that someone pumped water
into her lungs

00:31:51,322 --> 00:31:53,192
forcibly, intentionally.

00:31:53,192 --> 00:31:55,430
Like someone put a tube
down her throat.

00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,434
And then pumped water into her,

00:31:57,434 --> 00:31:59,104
I'd have to say,
after she was already dead.

00:31:59,104 --> 00:32:00,373
So, she didn't drown.

00:32:00,373 --> 00:32:03,112
The killer only wanted to
make it <i>look</i> like she drowned.

00:32:03,346 --> 00:32:06,251
The more likely cause
of death was suffocation,

00:32:06,251 --> 00:32:09,157
which ultimately yields
the same results as drowning--

00:32:09,157 --> 00:32:10,393
asphyxiation
of the brain.

00:32:10,527 --> 00:32:11,529
There was

00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:13,299
foreign matter in the lungs--

00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:15,504
organic flecks,
I couldn't identify--

00:32:15,504 --> 00:32:17,708
and I sent those to Hodges
for analysis.

00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:19,679
But the bottom line is,

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,115
we've been working with
the wrong cause of death.

00:32:21,115 --> 00:32:23,452
And with the wrong
cause of death,

00:32:23,452 --> 00:32:25,591
you most likely
have the wrong killer.

00:32:29,499 --> 00:32:31,068
At the time of
Daycia's death,

00:32:31,068 --> 00:32:33,339
the football star,
Zach, had been drinking,

00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:36,078
and he had two different
prescription meds in him, so,

00:32:36,078 --> 00:32:38,984
he was pretty
seriously impaired.

00:32:38,984 --> 00:32:41,489
He's not denying
he killed Daycia.

00:32:41,489 --> 00:32:43,359
He pretty much confessed.

00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:44,429
He says
he blacked out.

00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:47,100
So, you're thinking that Zach's
not responsible for the murder?

00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,603
According to the doc,
the drowning was staged

00:32:48,603 --> 00:32:50,106
by pumping her body
full of water.

00:32:50,106 --> 00:32:52,110
Now, if that's the case,
that means

00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,513
the killer had
to feed a tube down

00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,051
her trachea, into her lungs.
That's not an easy thing to do.

00:32:56,285 --> 00:32:57,988
Basically had to intubate her.

00:32:57,988 --> 00:33:00,359
I've seen ER docs struggle
to do this.

00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:03,065
It takes dexterity,
at the very least.

00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:05,404
Zach was drunk and full of meds,

00:33:05,404 --> 00:33:06,673
so, no way
he could have pulled that off.

00:33:06,673 --> 00:33:08,275
FINLAY:
If Zach is not the killer,

00:33:08,275 --> 00:33:09,445
where are we?

00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:12,083
We know that Adam
brought Daycia home in the cab

00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:14,689
at 3:00 a.m., and says
that he put her to bed.

00:33:14,689 --> 00:33:17,428
Come on, Adam!
I'm not tired!

00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:18,763
Everybody's trying
to sleep, okay?

00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,402
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna
be able to go to sleep.

00:33:21,402 --> 00:33:23,272
Okay, well, let's just
try to get you in bed.

00:33:23,272 --> 00:33:25,276
STOKES:
And we know
that Daycia wasn't ready

00:33:25,276 --> 00:33:28,483
to call it a night,
so she goes and convinces Zach

00:33:28,483 --> 00:33:30,754
that it's a good time
to take a bath.

00:33:30,754 --> 00:33:33,693
You don't see anything
that you want?

00:33:33,693 --> 00:33:35,764
Come on, Zach.

00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:38,570
In they go into the tub,
they have sex,

00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:42,411
leaving the marks on Daycia's
neck, and the scratches on Zach,

00:33:42,411 --> 00:33:44,549
but, also, leaving
Daycia alive and well.

00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:46,553
STOKES:
Tub takes 45 minutes,

00:33:46,553 --> 00:33:48,423
at the most, an hour.

00:33:48,423 --> 00:33:51,094
That gives the killer plenty of
time to take care of business.

00:33:51,094 --> 00:33:52,531
So, not counting Zach and Adam,

00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,635
there were three other people
in the house

00:33:54,635 --> 00:33:57,073
that we know of.
There were two patients--

00:33:57,073 --> 00:34:00,447
Karen and Len--
and a staffer named Twyla.

00:34:00,447 --> 00:34:04,522
At this point, any one
of the three is a candidate.

00:34:11,234 --> 00:34:13,506
Morgan?
Hey.

00:34:13,506 --> 00:34:14,709
Hodges, what's going on?

00:34:14,709 --> 00:34:17,080
I could use a little
help as to context.

00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,485
Doc Robbins found a foreign
substance in your victim's

00:34:19,485 --> 00:34:21,656
lungs, sent me a
sample for analysis.

00:34:21,656 --> 00:34:23,393
Okay, what did he find?

00:34:23,393 --> 00:34:24,562
It's all organic.

00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,334
Primarily a combination
of nitrogen, phosphorus,

00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:28,168
potassium and carbon.

00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:31,776
Some of the nitrogen had
converted into ammonia.

00:34:31,776 --> 00:34:33,480
How can I help?

00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,049
Well, it's
just that what's

00:34:35,049 --> 00:34:36,486
suggested by the chemicals

00:34:36,486 --> 00:34:39,525
and their particular proportions
is waste.

00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:41,562
Specifically,
fish or bird waste.

00:34:41,562 --> 00:34:42,564
Now, I don't know how
that could have gotten

00:34:42,564 --> 00:34:43,733
into your
victim's lungs.

00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:45,102
Fish waste.

00:34:45,102 --> 00:34:46,406
But that doesn't make any sense.

00:34:46,406 --> 00:34:49,245
Actually, Hodges,
it makes perfect sense.

00:34:59,832 --> 00:35:01,302
Ah. Look at this.

00:35:04,241 --> 00:35:04,742
Tubing.

00:35:04,742 --> 00:35:06,646
Looks like it would
be the right size

00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,283
to put down
someone's throat.

00:35:08,283 --> 00:35:10,587
Yeah. Now,
all you would need is a...

00:35:10,587 --> 00:35:12,591
pump...
(pump whistles)

00:35:12,591 --> 00:35:14,261
to pump with.

00:35:20,607 --> 00:35:22,678
The same set of prints
shows up on everything.

00:35:22,678 --> 00:35:26,486
They come back to the
house therapist, Twyla Owens.

00:35:27,187 --> 00:35:29,258
Oh, you said that she took
care of the fish tank,

00:35:29,258 --> 00:35:31,128
so it makes sense that her
prints would be everywhere.

00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:34,134
Well, everywhere
except for the plastic tubing.

00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:36,873
There were no prints there.
It's been wiped clean.
And what about the pump?

00:35:36,873 --> 00:35:40,147
Has tons of her prints on it,
and nobody else's.

00:35:40,147 --> 00:35:42,785
Why would the killer clean one
and not the other?

00:35:42,785 --> 00:35:44,722
Oh.

00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:50,167
Because the killer
didn't use the pump.

00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:52,137
There's a crack
in the housing.

00:35:54,642 --> 00:35:57,548
Yeah, and it's bone dry.

00:35:57,548 --> 00:35:59,418
There's no way this was part
of the murder weapon.

00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:01,389
Yeah, but the killer had
to use something

00:36:01,389 --> 00:36:02,925
to force the water
into Daycia's lungs.

00:36:02,925 --> 00:36:06,632
I mean, Doc said her alveoli
were popped like balloons.

00:36:08,603 --> 00:36:10,507
Well, then, maybe the killer

00:36:10,507 --> 00:36:14,281
pumped the water the same way
that you'd blow up a balloon.

00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:17,688
<i>Maybe he used his mouth.</i>

00:36:21,562 --> 00:36:23,433
If that's the case,

00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:26,305
maybe our killer left us
just what we need.

00:36:30,513 --> 00:36:32,751
Come on, this is insane.

00:36:32,751 --> 00:36:34,321
This is absolutely insane.

00:36:34,321 --> 00:36:36,826
I'm two days away
from completing the program.

00:36:36,826 --> 00:36:38,830
Two days away from...

00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,600
holding my kids
in my arms again.

00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,773
Is this some kind
of sick joke?

00:36:43,773 --> 00:36:45,577
Look, Daycia's death

00:36:45,577 --> 00:36:47,681
had absolutely nothing
to do with me.

00:36:47,681 --> 00:36:50,453
Says here that you worked
as an EMT in college.

00:36:50,453 --> 00:36:51,589
Is that right?
Yeah.

00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:54,495
Taught you how to intubate
a patient, didn't they?

00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:59,371
Yeah. Yeah. So what?
Too bad

00:36:59,371 --> 00:37:01,876
they didn't teach you about DNA,
because you left yours

00:37:01,876 --> 00:37:04,882
all over the tube there
when you blew in it.

00:37:04,882 --> 00:37:06,752
We also found the pillow

00:37:06,752 --> 00:37:09,692
that you used to
suffocate Daycia.

00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,633
Look, we have
everything we need.

00:37:13,633 --> 00:37:15,837
We know you did it.

00:37:17,874 --> 00:37:19,545
Of all the people in that house,

00:37:19,545 --> 00:37:21,449
you were the one
with the most to lose.

00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:22,986
Why would you
do something...?

00:37:22,986 --> 00:37:26,726
Because I had the most to lose,
because...

00:37:26,726 --> 00:37:28,663
because of my children.

00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:32,604
You know what Daycia was?

00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:36,812
Day-Daycia was that, um...

00:37:36,812 --> 00:37:39,685
She was that little devil.

00:37:39,685 --> 00:37:41,856
And the little devil sits
on your shoulder,

00:37:41,856 --> 00:37:43,426
tempts you to do bad things.

00:37:43,426 --> 00:37:45,397
So, wait. What are you...
what are you saying?

00:37:45,397 --> 00:37:48,036
Wh... Daycia tempted you
in some way? What?

00:37:48,036 --> 00:37:49,438
With alcohol?

00:37:49,438 --> 00:37:51,642
I woke up...
to go the bathroom

00:37:51,642 --> 00:37:53,246
in the middle of the night.

00:37:53,246 --> 00:37:56,919
It must have been
just past 4:00.

00:37:56,919 --> 00:37:59,658
I got back to my room.

00:37:59,658 --> 00:38:02,932
There was a bottle
sitting on my nightstand.

00:38:02,932 --> 00:38:06,705
A bottle of bourbon,
my brand,

00:38:06,705 --> 00:38:08,276
with a damn ribbon on it.

00:38:08,276 --> 00:38:09,578
And-and you think that Daycia

00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,749
put it there.
I know Daycia put it there.

00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:13,052
Like I just told you,

00:38:13,052 --> 00:38:14,822
she was that little devil.

00:38:14,822 --> 00:38:17,527
So, I got up, and I went,
and I confronted her.

00:38:17,527 --> 00:38:19,064
What the hell is this, Daycia?

00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:20,700
Why did you put this
in my room?

00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,072
Geez, Len, lighten
up. It's a gift.

00:38:23,072 --> 00:38:25,477
You know how important
the program is to me,

00:38:25,477 --> 00:38:27,982
that I stay clean
so I don't lose my kids.

00:38:27,982 --> 00:38:29,685
You know you
want some.
Stop it.

00:38:29,685 --> 00:38:31,322
Don't make me drink
all by myself.

00:38:31,322 --> 00:38:32,892
Mmm.

00:38:32,892 --> 00:38:35,296
She wouldn't stop.

00:38:35,296 --> 00:38:37,334
She wouldn't back off.

00:38:37,334 --> 00:38:38,803
She just kept at it.

00:38:38,803 --> 00:38:41,842
She kept trying
to get me to drink.

00:38:41,842 --> 00:38:44,081
Look, all I wanted to do

00:38:44,081 --> 00:38:45,985
was shut her up.

00:38:45,985 --> 00:38:47,787
with the pillow, I mean.

00:38:47,787 --> 00:38:48,891
I mean,

00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:50,426
come on, it was a pillow.

00:38:50,426 --> 00:38:51,762
I put it over her face

00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:55,003
just to get her
to stop talking.

00:38:55,003 --> 00:38:57,440
Stop it! Stop it!
No, stop!
(muffled scream)

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,647
I've worked too hard. I'm not
gonna throw my life away.

00:39:10,868 --> 00:39:13,339
(whispering):
I'm... sorry.

00:39:16,712 --> 00:39:20,453
The bathtub in Daycia's room
was already full,

00:39:20,453 --> 00:39:21,655
so I thought, why not...

00:39:21,655 --> 00:39:23,025
why not just make it look
like an accident?

00:39:23,025 --> 00:39:27,969
Make it look like
she just... slipped away.

00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:30,707
<i>I put her in the water.</i>

00:39:30,707 --> 00:39:33,880
<i>I got the piece of tubing</i>
<i>from the fish tank,</i>

00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,552
<i>and I made it look</i>
<i>like she drowned.</i>

00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:41,729
<i>Insane part</i>
<i>of this whole thing is,</i>

00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:43,699
I made it, you know that?

00:39:45,871 --> 00:39:48,376
I didn't drink.

00:39:48,376 --> 00:39:49,846
Even after she was dead...

00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:54,889
(crying):
...and it was quiet
in that room.

00:39:54,889 --> 00:39:57,895
I took that bottle, and I poured
it in the toil... toilet.

00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,704
(sniffles)

00:40:02,704 --> 00:40:04,708
I didn't touch it.

00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:06,846
(sighs, sniffles)

00:40:06,846 --> 00:40:08,950
I didn't take a sip.

00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,788
I needed to do that.

00:40:14,661 --> 00:40:17,701
(sobs)

00:40:20,841 --> 00:40:23,446
For them.

00:40:23,446 --> 00:40:25,183
(sighs)

00:40:29,692 --> 00:40:30,928
FINLAY:
<i>So, we are just about</i>
<i>cleared out,</i>

00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,497
and I'm officially
releasing the rooms.

00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:33,900
Good.

00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,603
We got two new
patients coming in.

00:40:35,603 --> 00:40:38,175
Wow. You don't waste
any time, do you?
We can't afford to.

00:40:38,175 --> 00:40:39,644
A lot of people need help.

00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,089
You know, I-I was really harsh

00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:46,860
the other day
when I talked to you

00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,162
about Daycia, and
I shouldn't have been.

00:40:48,162 --> 00:40:50,004
She didn't understand
her addiction.

00:40:50,004 --> 00:40:52,940
Didn't realize that
she was battling a disease.

00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,642
Most people don't.

00:40:54,642 --> 00:40:55,843
Patients come in here thinking

00:40:55,843 --> 00:40:57,678
all they have to do
is put in the time.

00:40:57,678 --> 00:41:00,047
Beating
addiction is work.

00:41:00,047 --> 00:41:02,716
Really hard work.

00:41:02,716 --> 00:41:05,853
And sadly, not everyone's up
for the challenge.

00:41:05,853 --> 00:41:07,988
Well, I don't know how you do
what you do.

00:41:07,988 --> 00:41:09,890
I was gonna say the same thing
to you.

00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:12,059
Guess we just keep
doing it, though.

00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:17,781
If we don't, who will?
Hmm. Good luck.
