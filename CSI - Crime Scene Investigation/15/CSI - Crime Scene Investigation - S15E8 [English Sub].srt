There's a lot of
damage to the neck.

00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:59,293
I'm counting three
sharp-force injuries,

00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:01,728

00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,432
Got arterial

00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:08,035
So he was standing right
there when he was stabbed.

00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:10,237
You know, if that's the case,
you'd expect to see

00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,572
more blood
on his torso.

00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,974
He must have been
dressed, right?

00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:16,276
Clothing shielded him

00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:17,678
the killer stripped him?

Got a lipstick case here.

00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,352
It's got bloodstains on it.

00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:28,155
A woman was here?
Could be another victim.

00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,090
Maybe an attempted rape
that took a turn.

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,592

Yeah, then why wouldn't
she just run away?

00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:40,100
Stripping a victim usually
suggests a sexual component.

00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,602
Maybe our mystery woman
was the predator.

00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,270

00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,196
Right. Because our faces

belongs to the victim,

00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:03,543

gave us an I.D.

00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,545
His name is Nelson Kern.

00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,714

There's a bloody purse
right there.

female killer.

Yeah, maybe.

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,192

dedicated to those

themselves Rubber Dolls.

the weapon wasn't

00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:19,923
Maybe a dull knife.

00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:21,592
I'm not so sure
it was a knife.

00:07:21,592 --> 00:07:24,561

edges of the wounds.

00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:26,864
Severed his
carotid artery.

00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,132
C.O.D. was
exsanguination.

00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:30,934
Looks like
a human bite mark.

00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:33,704
Yeah, it's one of several
incidental injuries I noted,

00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:38,208
including abrasions on his
wrists and bruising on his arms.

00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,611
Could be he was bound.
He was also

00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:42,946
under the influence.
Tox screen showed alcohol

00:07:42,946 --> 00:07:45,048
and ecstasy in his system.

00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,117

about the rubber suit?

00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:49,753
Yeah. Dressed up and messed up.

00:07:49,753 --> 00:07:51,755
Bad combo.

00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,826
I pulled a lot of trace
from the suit's skin.

00:07:55,826 --> 00:07:58,495
Uh, granted, a lot of it may be
transfer from the Dumpster,

00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:00,597

two perfumes,

00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:03,000
baby oil, carpet fibers

00:08:17,514 --> 00:08:19,783

how the face

00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:22,453

00:08:27,624 --> 00:08:29,626
We may not know much

the suit's maker does.

00:08:31,028 --> 00:08:34,031
Superglue fuming didn't provide
any viable prints,

00:08:34,031 --> 00:08:36,667

in the silicone.

00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:37,835
Check it out.

No. No, I'm not

and tell me
if you recognize them?

00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,771

the dolls might go out together,

that-that shade of blue--

00:15:33,817 --> 00:15:35,919
there's a wall painted
that color in an alley

00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:36,920
not too far from here,

00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,156
and one of the dolls
was-was killed last night.

00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:42,759
I believe her name
was Charlene.

00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:45,695

Okay. All right.

00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,739
What-what happened?

00:15:57,073 --> 00:16:00,143
I don't wear this for attention.

00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,913
It's just, it's something
to see in the mirror

00:16:02,913 --> 00:16:05,015

a little bit less.

00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,585

00:16:08,585 --> 00:16:10,787
Someone else didn't.

00:16:13,523 --> 00:16:15,058

00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:36,146

00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:39,649
I had enough humiliation.

00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:42,619
Okay.
But...

00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:45,922

00:17:02,806 --> 00:17:04,808
What kind of perv
goes out like that?

00:17:04,808 --> 00:17:06,076
What do you mean by that?
Wearing that costume,

00:17:06,076 --> 00:17:07,844
hiding his face.

00:17:07,844 --> 00:17:09,546
Guy's obviously embarrassed
of himself.

00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:12,115
So, you want
to look him in the eye?

00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:12,749
Huh? Is that it?

00:17:12,749 --> 00:17:15,485
You want to see his face?
No, man.
We're cool.

00:17:15,485 --> 00:17:18,154
What'd be the point?

00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:21,825
Yeah, what's the point?

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,763
Take a look at the face
of one of his friends.

00:17:27,764 --> 00:17:29,733
Someone didn't like
the outfit he had on,

00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:31,735
so they cut him out of it
with a knife.

00:17:33,036 --> 00:17:34,637
No, you don't think
I did that.

00:17:36,606 --> 00:17:37,841
No, I didn't do that.

00:17:38,608 --> 00:17:40,210
When was this?
When was he killed?

00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,945
Last night.

00:17:41,945 --> 00:17:44,614
I was clocked in all night,
pulling grave.

00:17:44,614 --> 00:17:46,883
Boss will tell you.
Just ring him up.

00:17:46,883 --> 00:17:49,185
Look, look, all right, yeah,
I roughed up the other one.

00:17:49,185 --> 00:17:51,187
If I'm getting charges for that,
all good,

00:17:51,187 --> 00:17:52,522
but I ain't a murderer.

00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:57,427
No charges.

00:17:57,427 --> 00:17:59,195
The victim doesn't want
to press any.

00:17:59,195 --> 00:18:01,564
Doesn't want
to show his face in court.

00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:03,566
Somehow,

00:18:03,566 --> 00:18:05,168
he's the one who's ashamed.

00:18:13,743 --> 00:18:15,045
What the...?

00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:16,613
Henry.

00:18:16,613 --> 00:18:19,115
Your befuddlement is showing
down the hallway.

00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:20,450
This is all so weird.

00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,018
What do you have?

00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:25,188
A DNA result, and a...
ghost story.

00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,524
I'm listening.

00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:28,792
I was swabbing
the Charlene suit,

00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:30,060
still hoping to find a sample

00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,528
of touch DNA
from the assailant.

00:18:34,497 --> 00:18:36,800
<i>I noticed the doll's earrings,</i>
<i>figured their sharp edges</i>

00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,935
<i>could have caught a chunk</i>
<i>of the killer.</i>

00:18:38,935 --> 00:18:41,771
Sure enough, there were skin
cells embedded in one of them.

00:18:41,771 --> 00:18:43,673
I ran DNA on the skin cells

00:18:43,673 --> 00:18:45,442
and got a hit in CODIS.

00:18:45,442 --> 00:18:47,143
A match to a woman...

00:18:47,143 --> 00:18:48,878

Charlene Brock.

00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,048
Charlene? Like the suit?

00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,017
They don't just share a name.

00:18:54,017 --> 00:18:55,218
They share a face.

00:18:57,987 --> 00:18:59,789

I've seen that woman before.

00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:01,825
I mean, the real her.

00:19:01,825 --> 00:19:03,059
Charlene Brock
had a short career

00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,561
as a model in the early '80s,

00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:05,595
including...

00:19:05,595 --> 00:19:07,197
one poster that
sold millions.

00:19:07,197 --> 00:19:10,033
Oh. That dress.

00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:12,102
Just like the one
on Rubber Charlene.

00:19:12,102 --> 00:19:14,037
Let me get this straight.

00:19:14,037 --> 00:19:16,039
So, pinup goddess dies,

00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:18,908
is reborn in rubber,
only to get murdered?

00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:22,946
With DNA from the real
dead woman on the rubber body.

00:19:22,946 --> 00:19:24,948
Insane.

00:19:24,948 --> 00:19:26,516
Charlene Brock's family still
lives in town.

00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:27,750
Might be worth a call.

00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,419
I'll text Russell.

00:19:31,721 --> 00:19:33,556
MAN:
What the hell?!

00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:37,193
This guy was dressed up
as Mom, wearing her earrings?

00:19:37,193 --> 00:19:39,195
It's completely sick.

00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:42,699
Mr. Brock, it's my understanding
that Charlene passed away...

00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:43,833
what was it, two years ago?

00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,502
Mmm.

00:19:45,502 --> 00:19:46,903
Mom had an aneurysm
out of nowhere.

00:19:46,903 --> 00:19:49,005
Well, I'm sorry.
Now, this man

00:19:49,005 --> 00:19:52,208
that was killed, um,
Nelson Kern?

00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,511
Recognize him? No?

00:19:54,511 --> 00:19:55,812
Connected to your mother maybe?

00:19:55,812 --> 00:19:58,114
Char still had some fans.

00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,116
You know, fellas

00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:03,052
who'd grown up worshipping
that poster, you know?

00:20:03,052 --> 00:20:04,554
Dad had an estate sale

00:20:04,554 --> 00:20:06,756
right after her death, and sold

00:20:06,756 --> 00:20:08,558
all of her stuff.
Well, then,

00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:10,860
it's possible that Mr. Kern
purchased those earrings

00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,929
from that sale, right?

00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:15,165
Maybe to make his
doll more authentic.

00:20:15,165 --> 00:20:16,599
This isn't right.

00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:19,969
Somebody steals her image and
walks around dressed up as her?

00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,070
Get over it, Jonah.

00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,139
No need to sue for
copyright infringement.

00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,641
You don't think it's creepy?

00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:27,210
Just a lonely guy who wanted
to be close to her.

00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:27,944
That's all.

00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,914
That was me a few decades ago.

00:20:30,914 --> 00:20:33,816
(sighs)

00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,519
I remember in '79,

00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:37,520
Charlene was a waitress,

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,756
and I was just starting out
my modeling agency.

00:20:39,756 --> 00:20:42,825
I convinced her to pose.

00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,094
That pinup made a nice buck,
let me tell you.

00:20:45,094 --> 00:20:47,530
And she married me.

00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,600
Gave me two wonderful children,
and she turned out to be

00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,902
one hell of a partner
at the agency.

00:20:52,902 --> 00:20:54,204
Sounds like quite a woman.

00:20:54,204 --> 00:20:55,471
Yeah.

00:20:55,772 --> 00:20:56,739
And whoever

00:20:56,739 --> 00:20:57,941
stabbed that
doll's lucky

00:20:57,941 --> 00:21:00,210
they didn't try it
on the real Charlene Brock.

00:21:02,879 --> 00:21:04,714
She wouldn't have let him
walk away.

00:21:09,652 --> 00:21:10,620
If you ever thought

00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,189
those reality show housewives
were catty, they got nothing

00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,024
on these vulcanized vixens.

00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,093
Web forum
for Vegas Rubber Dolls.

00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:19,095
Nick's hate crime suspect

00:21:19,095 --> 00:21:21,965
alibi'd out, so now I'm focusing
on doll-on-doll drama.

00:21:21,965 --> 00:21:23,600
The gossip, the grudges.

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,101
And this forum

00:21:25,101 --> 00:21:27,537
is where they like to
sling a lot of dirt.

00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:29,172
Find anything helpful?
Maybe.

00:21:29,172 --> 00:21:31,641
Charlene, it turns out,
has a rival doll.

00:21:31,641 --> 00:21:34,510
The mysterious
and alluring Lexy.

00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,112
Hmm.

00:21:36,112 --> 00:21:37,046
It's not one of the dolls

00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,815
that Russell and Greg
met at the club.

00:21:38,815 --> 00:21:40,583
Story I've been able to put
together from the forum

00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:43,453
is that Lexy was
the queen of the club

00:21:43,453 --> 00:21:45,521
until Charlene showed up
last month,

00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:47,090
became the new hot hot thing.

00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,092
And Lexy wasn't
happy about it.

00:21:49,092 --> 00:21:51,694
Social snub could become motive.

00:21:51,694 --> 00:21:53,763
Do we, uh, know
Lexy's real identity?

00:21:53,763 --> 00:21:55,765
Nobody breaks character
on these sites.

00:21:55,765 --> 00:21:57,433
I messaged Lexy,
but no response.

00:21:57,433 --> 00:21:59,736
But I noticed
she wasn't in any

00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:02,005
of the posted club photos
from the night of the murder.

00:22:02,005 --> 00:22:03,172
Well, maybe
because she was

00:22:03,172 --> 00:22:04,540
outside in the alley
(phone dings)

00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,477
waiting to
attack Charlene.

00:22:07,477 --> 00:22:09,112
Unis just found
Charlene's-- well,

00:22:09,112 --> 00:22:11,047
Nelson Kern's--
car a couple blocks

00:22:11,047 --> 00:22:12,949
from the club.
You want to check it out?

00:22:12,949 --> 00:22:14,751
Absolutely.
Let's do it.

00:22:17,153 --> 00:22:19,689
Unis cleared it,
but they didn't search it?

00:22:33,446 --> 00:22:35,581
Whoa. Sara.

00:22:35,581 --> 00:22:38,017
We know Charlene was
Kern's rubber ride

00:22:38,017 --> 00:22:40,352
the night of his death,
but take a look at this.

00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,556
This looks familiar.

00:22:43,556 --> 00:22:44,957
That's Lexy.

00:22:44,957 --> 00:22:46,559
Rubber Charlene's rival doll.

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,294
I don't get it.

00:22:48,294 --> 00:22:51,097
Nelson Kern was wearing
the Charlene suit when he died.

00:22:51,097 --> 00:22:53,065
What's he doing with Lexy
in the trunk?

00:22:53,065 --> 00:22:55,134
(sighs)
As far as I understand,

00:22:55,134 --> 00:22:58,504
every guy only has one
Rubber Doll persona.

00:22:58,504 --> 00:23:00,606
Doesn't make sense that
Kern would be both

00:23:00,606 --> 00:23:02,108
Lexy and Charlene.

00:23:02,108 --> 00:23:04,477
Okay.

00:23:09,415 --> 00:23:10,483
I got a crowbar

00:23:10,483 --> 00:23:12,118
and bolt cutters.

00:23:12,118 --> 00:23:15,121
Break-in gear.
Kern had a few
priors for burglary.

00:23:15,121 --> 00:23:16,956
Taking a flier
on this one, maybe,

00:23:16,956 --> 00:23:19,358
but let's just say
that Nelson Kern usually

00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:21,460
stepped out at
night as Lexy,

00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,562
the belle
of the rubber ball.

00:23:23,562 --> 00:23:25,931
Until Charlene shows up,

00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:28,400
making Lexy and Kern

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,002
old news.

00:23:30,002 --> 00:23:31,570
That would make Kern
jealous, right?

00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,206
Jealous enough, maybe,
with his history of B-and-Es,

00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:36,909
to break in and steal
Charlene from her owner.

00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:38,544
And then don Charlene
for the night.

00:23:38,544 --> 00:23:40,446
I buy it.
But if we're
right, then who's

00:23:40,446 --> 00:23:41,547
Charlene's owner?

00:23:41,547 --> 00:23:43,482
And where did Kern
steal her from?

00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:48,854
Maybe these will help
answer that question.

00:23:48,854 --> 00:23:51,924
There's some trace
in the blades.

00:23:51,924 --> 00:23:53,359
Looks like concrete powder.

00:23:57,363 --> 00:23:58,931
This morning I noticed
you were doing

00:23:58,931 --> 00:24:01,867
some concrete work
back here.

00:24:01,867 --> 00:24:05,437
Yeah, just, uh, just trying
to keep the place looking nice.

00:24:05,437 --> 00:24:08,240
My wife loved
this house.

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,509
You appear to have had
a break-in back here.

00:24:16,482 --> 00:24:17,983
Mr. Brock, I'm gonna need

00:24:17,983 --> 00:24:19,185
to take a look inside.

My wife was my world.

That Charlene suit
was yours, wasn't it?

00:25:15,794 --> 00:25:17,196
Nelson Kern

00:25:17,196 --> 00:25:18,898
broke in and stole it.

00:25:18,898 --> 00:25:20,833
Stole her. From me.

00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:30,776
I loved her.

00:25:30,776 --> 00:25:33,479
I lived for her.

00:25:35,481 --> 00:25:37,650
Did you kill for her?

00:25:44,629 --> 00:25:46,897
Stan, you lied to me.

00:25:46,897 --> 00:25:49,233
Told me you didn't know
anything about the suit.

00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:52,036
My children were
sitting right there.

00:25:52,036 --> 00:25:54,138
They wouldn't
have understood

how I-I clung
to everything

00:25:56,607 --> 00:25:58,242
that was left
of their mother.

00:25:58,242 --> 00:26:01,012
Is that why you went
to this, um,

00:26:01,012 --> 00:26:05,016
Belinda Goff-- had her make you
one of those suits?

00:26:05,016 --> 00:26:06,851
I stumbled across
her work online.

00:26:06,851 --> 00:26:10,221
<i>And I sent her</i>

Lexy.

00:26:42,853 --> 00:26:45,189
Right. We found the Lexy suit.

00:26:45,189 --> 00:26:46,657
We know that it belonged to a

00:26:46,657 --> 00:26:50,161
Nelson Kern.
His DNA is all over it.

00:26:50,161 --> 00:26:53,230

and he took your wife out
for a spin.

And it cost him
his life, didn't it?

Mr. Russell, much
as I may cherish

00:27:13,184 --> 00:27:16,153
the memory of my
wife, her beauty,

00:27:16,153 --> 00:27:18,789
and wanted to possess it,

00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:21,292
I would never hurt someone else

00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:23,060
for trying to possess it, too.

FINLAY:
<i>I was doing some digging, and I</i>

00:27:27,965 --> 00:27:29,834
checked police
activity in the alley

00:27:29,834 --> 00:27:31,102
the night of
the murders.

00:27:31,102 --> 00:27:34,939
There was a parking ticket
issued to an Escalade, and...

00:27:34,939 --> 00:27:37,675
the carpet fiber trace that
we found on the Charlene suit

00:27:37,675 --> 00:27:41,679
is consistent with
the interior of an Escalade.

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,280
And the vehicle
is registered

00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,215
to this guy.

00:27:44,648 --> 00:27:47,852
I met him at the club.
He's one of their admirers.

00:27:47,852 --> 00:27:48,953
Let's bring him in.

00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:57,094
Hi, Adrian. I'm CSI Finlay.

00:27:57,094 --> 00:27:59,697
I, uh, would like to talk
to you about Charlene.

00:27:59,697 --> 00:28:01,132
We know she was
in your vehicle.

00:28:01,132 --> 00:28:03,033
We found carpet fibers
that are consistent

00:28:03,033 --> 00:28:05,236
with the interior
of an Escalade

00:28:05,236 --> 00:28:06,837
on her doll suit.

00:28:06,837 --> 00:28:10,574
You know what it is I love
about the dolls at that club?

00:28:10,574 --> 00:28:12,610
How little they speak.

00:28:13,677 --> 00:28:15,980
They're as close
to the ideal woman

00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,315
as I've ever met.

00:28:19,216 --> 00:28:20,751
Wow.

00:28:20,751 --> 00:28:22,620
I can't imagine

00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,688
how you could have
struck out

00:28:24,688 --> 00:28:26,590
with real women.

00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,691
(chuckles)

00:28:27,691 --> 00:28:29,693
Well, real women
are just as fake...

00:28:30,861 --> 00:28:32,163
...but lie about it.

00:28:32,163 --> 00:28:33,831
Well, if I were
to tell you

00:28:33,831 --> 00:28:36,267
that my eyelashes
are not this great...

00:28:38,002 --> 00:28:39,737
...would you be honest with me?

00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:42,239
Fair enough.

00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:45,576
Charlene did join
me in my vehicle.

00:28:45,576 --> 00:28:47,178
We'd been flirting with
each other for the past

00:28:47,178 --> 00:28:48,712
few weeks at the club.

00:28:48,712 --> 00:28:50,915
So tell me what happened
in the car.

00:28:50,915 --> 00:28:53,684
Oh, we, uh, played around.

00:28:53,684 --> 00:28:55,686
Then she left.

00:28:55,686 --> 00:28:58,556
With abrasions on her arms
and a bite mark on her shoulder.

00:28:58,556 --> 00:29:01,692
Which I bet is
going to be a match to those

00:29:01,692 --> 00:29:03,694
fake veneers you got in there.

00:29:03,694 --> 00:29:05,196
(laughs)

00:29:05,196 --> 00:29:08,299
What can I say?

00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:09,667
I like rough sex.

00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:10,935
She had thick skin.

00:29:10,935 --> 00:29:13,270
I did my research on you,
and I did find

00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:16,874
that you have a history
of sexual assault.

00:29:16,874 --> 00:29:19,076
Allegations. All dropped.

00:29:19,076 --> 00:29:20,311
Uh-huh.

00:29:20,311 --> 00:29:22,680
Well, you know
what I think happened?

00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,749
I think that Charlene
was so messed up

00:29:25,749 --> 00:29:27,818
that she decided
to get into your car.

00:29:27,818 --> 00:29:29,086
And then when you started

00:29:29,086 --> 00:29:32,089
to hurt her, she bailed.

00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:34,225
So you followed her--

00:29:34,225 --> 00:29:37,828
'cause you didn't like getting
rejected by a blow-up doll--

00:29:37,828 --> 00:29:39,029
and then you stabbed her.

00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:40,297
Stripped off her suit,

00:29:40,297 --> 00:29:41,765
because everybody
at the club

00:29:41,765 --> 00:29:43,567
knows who
Charlene is, but, uh,

00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:45,803
Nelson Kern, he's a nobody.

00:29:45,803 --> 00:29:48,839
(short chuckle)

00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:51,208
Well, truth is...

00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:53,244
I showed her too
good of a time.

00:29:53,244 --> 00:29:55,579
She couldn't
contain herself.

00:29:55,579 --> 00:29:58,582
And that voice that groaned out?

00:29:58,582 --> 00:30:00,851
Deep-sixed the mood.

00:30:00,851 --> 00:30:03,654
I kicked her out and drove off.

00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,725
Am I free to go?

00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,929
Got any evidence
from the suspect's SUV yet?

00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:13,197
Finn is still working

00:30:13,197 --> 00:30:14,899
the carpets and the
upholstery, but so far

00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:16,834
we haven't found any blood.

00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:19,169
Even though Kern was stabbed
outside, in the alley...

00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:20,571
Yeah, you would have
expected

00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:22,573
that Graham would have
tracked some of the blood

00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:24,141
back into the vehicle.
You sure would.

00:30:24,141 --> 00:30:26,110
What is all this lovely stuff?

00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:29,213
Well, this is Adrian Graham's
mobile sex pantry. Lotions,

00:30:29,213 --> 00:30:32,249
lubes and other sinful sundries
that he kept in his SUV.

00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:34,251
We found them
neatly organized.

00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:37,154
I was hoping in his cleanup that
he left a smear of blood behind,

00:30:37,154 --> 00:30:38,856
but, uh, no
such luck.

00:30:38,856 --> 00:30:41,725
Excuse me a sec, here.

00:30:43,027 --> 00:30:45,195
Baby oil.

00:30:45,195 --> 00:30:47,865
Nick found trace amounts
of baby oil

00:30:47,865 --> 00:30:50,301
on the Charlene suit.

00:30:50,301 --> 00:30:52,036
Now, it's possible that...

00:30:52,036 --> 00:30:54,738
that some of this got
transferred from the suit

00:30:54,738 --> 00:30:55,906
onto the assailant.

00:30:55,906 --> 00:30:57,775
I'm not sure what that gets us.

00:30:57,775 --> 00:30:59,877
Graham already admitted
that he was with her.

00:30:59,877 --> 00:31:01,779
He just denies being
there for the murder.

00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:03,013
Right, but whoever
the killer is,

00:31:03,013 --> 00:31:05,716
we have no indication of his
movements in that alley

00:31:05,716 --> 00:31:07,785
in the moments
right after the death.

00:31:07,785 --> 00:31:09,920
No shoe prints,
no blood trail.

00:31:12,623 --> 00:31:16,126
Oil trail could
be very helpful.

00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:18,729
Baby oil fluoresces at a lower
frequency than biologicals,

00:31:18,729 --> 00:31:22,833
so I've set the ALSs
at 525 nanometers.

00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:25,669
There's a lot of oil here,
where the body was.

00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:27,104
Uh-huh.

00:31:27,104 --> 00:31:29,106
Oh, there you go.

00:31:29,106 --> 00:31:31,642
Trail of oil going off
in this direction.

00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:33,944
Oily part of the suit
must have been dragged along.

00:31:37,715 --> 00:31:39,683
Huh. Brushed the wall here.

00:31:50,127 --> 00:31:51,261
(short laugh)

00:31:52,563 --> 00:31:53,664
It's the murder weapon.

00:31:53,664 --> 00:31:55,733
It's a nail file.

00:31:55,733 --> 00:31:57,835
Consistent with the wounds
that Doc Robbins found.

00:31:57,835 --> 00:31:59,803
Sharp-pointed
but square-edged.

00:31:59,803 --> 00:32:02,573
See this logo right there?
Uh-huh.

00:32:02,573 --> 00:32:04,775
That's the Brock family

00:32:04,775 --> 00:32:06,610
modeling agency.

00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,746
Murder with a corporate sponsor.

00:32:12,616 --> 00:32:14,651
We pulled a fingerprint

00:32:14,651 --> 00:32:16,820
off of the weapon, Jonah.

00:32:18,255 --> 00:32:20,190
And it's yours.

00:32:22,126 --> 00:32:24,128
The weapon is one of 20 I gifted

00:32:24,128 --> 00:32:25,929
friends of our agency
at the memorial

00:32:25,929 --> 00:32:27,865
after my mom died.

00:32:27,865 --> 00:32:29,767
It was a gesture in her honor.

00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:31,035
Really?

00:32:31,035 --> 00:32:32,770
A nail file as a tribute?

00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,738
It was kind of her thing.

00:32:34,738 --> 00:32:36,774
Those dealing with
Charlene Brock

00:32:36,774 --> 00:32:39,243
knew that if she started
working on her cuticles...

00:32:39,243 --> 00:32:41,812
<i>she wasn't happy,</i>
<i>and you better make her happy.</i>

00:32:41,812 --> 00:32:43,180
Don't come into my office
with excuses,

00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,782
you cowardly piece of...

00:32:44,782 --> 00:32:47,618
I gave the file
out as a memento.

00:32:47,618 --> 00:32:49,219
My prints might be
on every one of 'em.

00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:51,822
You know, I might buy that...

00:32:51,822 --> 00:32:53,724
had I not learned
about another file.

00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:56,193
Your recent
motion to remove

00:32:56,193 --> 00:32:58,629
your father as head
of the modeling agency.

00:32:58,629 --> 00:33:00,998
Uh...

00:33:00,998 --> 00:33:05,202
the company started slipping
after my mom died.

00:33:05,202 --> 00:33:08,772
She was the guts,
the-the cutthroat, the whip

00:33:08,772 --> 00:33:11,241
that my dad needed.
And after she died,

00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:14,344
I noticed
that he started slipping.

00:33:14,344 --> 00:33:16,680
Professionally and otherwise.

00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,349
You knew about his
Rubber Dolling. I think you...

00:33:19,349 --> 00:33:20,951
talk about it
in your statement.

00:33:20,951 --> 00:33:23,287
Hey. Yeah,
I knew about all that.

00:33:23,287 --> 00:33:27,658
I saw a few of his selfies when
I borrowed his laptop one day.

00:33:27,658 --> 00:33:30,627
Hey, whatever the old man needs
to get his kicks.

00:33:30,627 --> 00:33:32,129
But...

00:33:32,129 --> 00:33:35,265
if a rival photo agency
pops a picture of him in his...

00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:36,700
costume...

00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:41,171
...everything that he and my mom
built goes away.

00:33:41,171 --> 00:33:42,339
Instead of going to you.

00:33:42,339 --> 00:33:44,808
The board
shut you down,

00:33:44,808 --> 00:33:46,944
which left you
only one other way

00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:48,779
to take your dad
out of the picture.

00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:50,314
You just didn't know

00:33:50,314 --> 00:33:52,249
that the wrong man
was in the suit.

00:33:52,249 --> 00:33:54,718
(chuckles)

00:33:54,718 --> 00:33:56,153
Ms. Finlay,

00:33:56,153 --> 00:33:58,922
I didn't stab anyone,
and I'll prove it to you.

00:33:58,922 --> 00:34:01,024
I spent the night of
the crime producing

00:34:01,024 --> 00:34:03,560
a photo shoot, and I spent
the rest of the evening

00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,195
in the company
of one of the models.

00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,832
I have video.

00:34:08,832 --> 00:34:11,768
(inhales deeply)
You feeling good?

00:34:11,768 --> 00:34:13,704
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

00:34:17,741 --> 00:34:19,877
(chuckles)

00:34:19,877 --> 00:34:22,813
I guess talking isn't her thing.

00:34:24,882 --> 00:34:27,684
We don't have
to talk, beautiful.

00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:33,690
Whoa.

00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,692
Checking out Jonah Brock's
alibi, are you?

00:34:35,692 --> 00:34:38,729
Yeah, the time stamp
on the video puts him at home

00:34:38,729 --> 00:34:41,165
between 11:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m.

00:34:41,165 --> 00:34:42,833
Well, the murder
was around midnight.

00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:45,769
So, unless Jonah messed
with the metadata...

00:34:45,769 --> 00:34:47,204
Look at him.

00:34:47,204 --> 00:34:48,805
Does he strike you
as the type of guy

00:34:48,805 --> 00:34:50,874
who spends a lot of time
playing around with a computer?

00:34:50,874 --> 00:34:52,309
I don't know. I mean,

00:34:52,309 --> 00:34:54,912
first impressions
aren't always right.

00:34:54,912 --> 00:34:57,247
Right. The way
you were spotted for 5-O

00:34:57,247 --> 00:35:00,350
in .5 seconds
at the club there, Columbo.

00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,818
Russell told me about that.

00:35:01,818 --> 00:35:06,056
Whatever. So obviously
Jonah Brock's alibi checks out.

00:35:06,056 --> 00:35:08,058
He's not our killer.
No.

00:35:08,058 --> 00:35:10,060
Did we get anything else
off the nail file?

00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,295
There were
minute bits

00:35:11,295 --> 00:35:14,131
of fingernail lodged in
with the crosshatches.

00:35:14,131 --> 00:35:15,899
DNA came back unknown female.

00:35:15,899 --> 00:35:19,636
Oh, and there was some
unusual trace mixed in.

00:35:19,636 --> 00:35:21,071
Particles of gold.

00:35:21,071 --> 00:35:22,839
Gold?

00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:25,842
Hang on a second.

00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,748
Check that out.

00:35:34,985 --> 00:35:37,821
Ms. Irina Turri.
You remember her, right?

00:35:37,821 --> 00:35:39,223
She's back in
Helsinki right now.

00:35:39,223 --> 00:35:40,691
We couldn't
bring her in,

00:35:40,691 --> 00:35:42,626
but we talked to her
on the phone,

00:35:42,626 --> 00:35:45,796
and she said that her nails
were filed by the assistant

00:35:45,796 --> 00:35:47,297
at the photo shoot.

00:35:47,297 --> 00:35:49,299
That would be you, right, April?

00:35:51,268 --> 00:35:55,272
That same file found its way
into Nelson Kern's neck.

00:35:55,272 --> 00:35:58,675
I already told you
I didn't know that man.

00:35:58,675 --> 00:35:59,876
Why would I stab him?

00:35:59,876 --> 00:36:02,813
Well, because you weren't
really stabbing him,

00:36:02,813 --> 00:36:03,814
were you?

00:36:03,814 --> 00:36:06,216
You were stabbing your mother.

00:36:06,216 --> 00:36:08,585
And your father.
I love my father.

00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:10,787
I was the one who defended him

00:36:10,787 --> 00:36:12,723
when my brother tried
to destroy him.

00:36:12,723 --> 00:36:13,924
Right.

00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:15,759
The business
deposition, right?

00:36:15,759 --> 00:36:17,794
You painted your
dad as having...

00:36:17,794 --> 00:36:20,998
suffered under your
mother's tyranny.

00:36:20,998 --> 00:36:23,667
It's quite the eulogy
for your... for your mom.

00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:25,102
It was the truth.

00:36:25,102 --> 00:36:27,337
Dad and I always stood up
for each other, ever since

00:36:27,337 --> 00:36:30,173
I was a kid, every time
my mom would...

00:36:30,173 --> 00:36:32,843
Would...

00:36:32,843 --> 00:36:34,311
would what?

00:36:34,811 --> 00:36:38,115
If you didn't live up
to my mother's expectations,

00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:39,883
she would crush you.

00:36:39,883 --> 00:36:42,719
And I guess the perfect daughter
that she wanted

00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:44,821
wasn't me, so... it's hard
enough to see that

00:36:44,821 --> 00:36:46,156
in your mom's eyes.

00:36:46,156 --> 00:36:48,659
It's harder when she...

00:36:48,659 --> 00:36:51,128
starts taking it out on you.

00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,630
I can see that.

00:36:53,997 --> 00:36:57,000
So when your...
when your mother passed away,

00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,169
you must have felt
like you were...

00:36:59,169 --> 00:37:01,705
free of her cruelty.

00:37:01,705 --> 00:37:03,607
Your dad was free, too.

00:37:03,607 --> 00:37:05,075

00:37:06,076 --> 00:37:07,978

didn't want to be.

00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:08,493
You are.
But...

00:41:08,493 --> 00:41:10,395
it's not who I am.

00:41:10,395 --> 00:41:12,530
It doesn't define me.

00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:16,268
And so I've just been looking
at old photos

00:41:16,268 --> 00:41:17,669
of all the different...

00:41:17,669 --> 00:41:20,305
stuff I used to do.

00:41:20,305 --> 00:41:22,741
Parties, traveling.

00:41:22,741 --> 00:41:25,310
6:00 a.m.
Kind of early

00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:28,280
for a... identity crisis.

00:41:28,446 --> 00:41:29,581
I guess.

00:41:29,981 --> 00:41:31,349
Listen,

00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:32,851
Greg...

00:41:34,486 --> 00:41:37,822
people are never
just one thing.

00:41:37,822 --> 00:41:39,958
Like, look at
your friends.

00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:43,862
This guy, Mr. Sweet Dad.

00:41:43,862 --> 00:41:45,764
You really think
that's all he is?

00:41:45,764 --> 00:41:48,767
I once watched
that guy eat a beer can.

00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:50,535
(laughs)
True story.

00:41:50,535 --> 00:41:53,271
People are complicated.

00:41:53,947 --> 00:41:55,949
It's never
that simple.

00:41:55,949 --> 00:41:59,018
Everybody has layers.

00:42:01,287 --> 00:42:04,023
People read "cop,"

00:42:04,023 --> 00:42:07,060
maybe I'll at least get
a free cup of coffee.

00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,528
(chuckles)
If they give you free donuts,

00:42:08,528 --> 00:42:10,964
that means they're making fun
of you.

00:42:12,131 --> 00:42:16,302
Well, how about if I update
my status to say,

00:42:16,302 --> 00:42:18,304
"Taking a friend out
for a beer."

00:42:18,304 --> 00:42:21,975
Me? Yes. I would love that.

00:42:21,975 --> 00:42:24,944
All right, hold on.

00:42:24,944 --> 00:42:26,579
Ooh. Yeah, I love that place.
