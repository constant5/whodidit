00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,713
MAN:
<i>It</i> will <i>come to pass!</i>

00:00:05,713 --> 00:00:07,116
It's just a matter of time.

00:00:07,116 --> 00:00:09,487
You can only lie
to yourselves for so long.

00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:11,158
We pretend that
we're not afraid.

00:00:11,158 --> 00:00:12,628
But when it happens

00:00:12,628 --> 00:00:15,701
and that day comes...

00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:19,175
<i>nothing will stop the world</i>
<i>from bleeding.</i>

00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:21,447
<i>Nothing!</i>

00:00:24,555 --> 00:00:26,559
(door opens)

00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,503
I spoke with
responding officers.

00:00:31,503 --> 00:00:33,675
Landlord came by here
to pick up the rent,

00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:35,278
saw him and turned
right around.

00:00:35,278 --> 00:00:37,149
Tenant's name
is Jack Smith.

00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:38,452
He lived alone.

00:00:38,452 --> 00:00:41,425
Sounds like a
throwaway name.

00:00:41,425 --> 00:00:42,427
Let me guess:

00:00:42,427 --> 00:00:45,400
paid all cash, no I.D. on file.

00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,371
Lifestyles of the broke
and anonymous.

00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:49,576
This place is
covered in blood.

00:00:50,612 --> 00:00:52,617
There's blood
on the floor.

00:00:52,617 --> 00:00:54,287
There's more
on the wall.

00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:57,193
It's all over
the place.

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,544
Blood void.
Got a spent
shell over here.

00:01:05,544 --> 00:01:06,648
Nine-mil casing.

00:01:07,215 --> 00:01:08,618
SIDLE:
GSW to his neck.

00:01:08,618 --> 00:01:11,057
Looks like he bled out
pretty quickly.

00:01:11,057 --> 00:01:14,231
Yeah? Then how did blood
get all over the room?

00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:16,670
Expirated blood
on the wall here.

00:01:18,507 --> 00:01:20,411
Possible fight
before the kill shot?

00:01:20,411 --> 00:01:22,616
Well, if we're lucky,
maybe some of this blood

00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,353
belongs to his assailant.

00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:32,271
This whole bookshelf is about

00:01:32,271 --> 00:01:33,473
world-ending
plagues,

00:01:33,473 --> 00:01:36,413
biological disasters...

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,163
The wall is just plastered
with paranoia.

00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,671
Uh... Greg?

00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:48,640
Yeah?

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,311
This man was sick.

00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:51,880
What do you mean?

00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,417
I mean, don't touch anything.

00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:55,187
I'm, uh, uh...
I'm gonna call the CDC.

00:01:55,187 --> 00:01:57,126
His eye.

00:01:57,126 --> 00:01:59,464
Have you ever seen
anything like that before?

00:01:59,464 --> 00:02:01,870
SANDERS:
Yeah, in biology textbooks.

00:02:02,805 --> 00:02:04,241
Viral epidemics.

00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:05,611
Exactly.

00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:08,150
SANDERS:
The pathogen could be

00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,453
in all this blood.

00:02:11,557 --> 00:02:12,660
It could be airborne.

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,729
Try not to panic.

00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:15,699
I'm just trying not to breathe.

00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:18,406
SIDLE:
This is CSI Sara Sidle from
the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:02:18,406 --> 00:02:21,579
I'm at a crime scene with
what appears to be a possible

00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:22,916
hemorrhagic fever.

00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,921
One decedent.

00:02:27,158 --> 00:02:29,597
Two others may
have been exposed.

Let's go!
Get the windows sealed!

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,307
Secure the perimeter!

00:03:19,307 --> 00:03:22,247
No entry without
Level Four coverage.

00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:23,583
Keep it moving!

00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:24,652
Clock is ticking!

00:03:27,793 --> 00:03:28,795
PHILLIPS:
Hey.

00:03:28,795 --> 00:03:30,465
Russell.
I'm so sorry.

00:03:30,465 --> 00:03:31,734
I should've been the
first one in there.

00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:33,672
I-I got stuck at that
suicide over on...

00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,378
Relax. You were just
doing your job.
Coroner's office?

00:03:36,378 --> 00:03:37,447
Yeah.
He'll get
you suited up

00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:38,450
for entry to remove

00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,687
the infected decedent.
Of course.

00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,358
Supervisor Russell?

00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:43,661
Yes.
Dr. Emmett,

00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:45,365
CDC Emergency
Response Specialist.

00:03:45,365 --> 00:03:47,469
Any idea what
we're dealing with here?

00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:49,474
Undetermined, but the symptoms
suggest a virus.

00:03:49,474 --> 00:03:51,478
We're treating the house
as a hot zone.

00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:52,714
Extracting the potentially
exposed subjects.

00:03:52,714 --> 00:03:54,953
Those "subjects"
are my CSIs.

00:03:54,953 --> 00:03:56,555
I just spoke to them
on the phone.

00:03:56,555 --> 00:03:58,460
They're a little concerned
about what's happening next.

00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,662
They'll be suited up

00:03:59,662 --> 00:04:01,366
and transported
to hospital quarantine.

00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,037
They mention having removed
anything from inside the house?

00:04:03,037 --> 00:04:04,440
No. No, no, no.

00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,044
All their gear, their
collected evidence,

00:04:06,044 --> 00:04:08,282
is still inside.
Good. It'll stay there.

00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:09,852
Once the subjects are out,
we'll nuke the place.

00:04:09,852 --> 00:04:10,854
Wait, wait, I'm sorry.

00:04:10,854 --> 00:04:11,990
What do you mean, "nuke"?

00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,429
Blast it with UV light
and formaldehyde fog,

00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:15,999
killing any living
organism in there.

00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:17,402
There's our
artillery now.

00:04:17,402 --> 00:04:19,741
RUSSELL:
Well... wait a sec.

00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:22,613
The dead man in there
was-was killed by a gunshot.

00:04:22,613 --> 00:04:24,384
I heard.
Not his day at the tables.

00:04:24,384 --> 00:04:25,821
What I'm saying
is there was

00:04:25,821 --> 00:04:27,959
at least one other
person-- the shooter--

00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,295
inside that room.

00:04:29,295 --> 00:04:30,431
And he might
be infected.

00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:32,602
So frying all the
biologicals in there

00:04:32,602 --> 00:04:35,007
might stop us from
tracking the guy down.

00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:36,377
A valid point.

00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,348
But no match for
the holy gospel of protocol.

00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:39,585
I'll keep you updated.

00:04:39,585 --> 00:04:41,589
(helicopter whirring,
indistinct radio chatter)

00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:56,990
You okay in there?

00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,060
We had to leave
the evidence behind.

00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,364
SANDERS:
Scene's getting

00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:01,666
completely stepped on in there.

00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,838
We uploaded our photos
to the cloud.

00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:05,341
It might be all
we can salvage.

00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:06,677
I'm not concerned
about that right now.

00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:07,680
EMMETT:
Folks,

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,782
we need to
keep moving!

00:05:37,913 --> 00:05:39,918
♪&amp; ♪&amp;

00:06:07,913 --> 00:06:09,884
♪&amp; ♪&amp;

00:06:19,772 --> 00:06:23,080
RUSSELL:
<i>If they've been infected,</i>
<i>we may not know for days.</i>

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,683
Viral incubation period

00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:26,454
could be up to two
weeks, you know,

00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:27,790
so they'll be tested,

00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,796
observed, and... I don't know,
we just wait, I guess.

00:06:30,796 --> 00:06:32,033
This is rough, D.B.

00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:33,068
State's sending resources.

00:06:33,068 --> 00:06:34,472
Area hospitals are on alert.

00:06:34,472 --> 00:06:36,175
I mean, soon the story's
gonna hit the news,

00:06:36,175 --> 00:06:37,578
and then everything
gets cranked up.

00:06:37,578 --> 00:06:38,948
I've got Morgan
and Nick

00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:40,251
going over the
crime scene photos.

00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:43,157
On top of all this, we have a...
a murder to solve.

00:06:43,157 --> 00:06:44,894
Yeah, right.
Gunshot in the throat

00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:46,598
almost feels quaint,
doesn't it?

00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:47,834
Supervisor Russell?
Yes.

00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:49,505
Dr. Heather Lanning,
from RyneLab Biomedical.

00:06:49,505 --> 00:06:52,612
My counterpart at the CDC
informed you I'd be here?

00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,482
Yeah. This is...
Sheriff Ecklie.
Hi.

00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:55,651
Hi.

00:06:55,651 --> 00:06:57,623
I understand the
situation's overwhelming.

00:06:57,623 --> 00:06:58,792
I'm here to help.

00:06:58,792 --> 00:06:59,928
RyneLab is a private

00:06:59,928 --> 00:07:01,632
research facility
right here in Nevada.

00:07:01,632 --> 00:07:03,936
The only Biosafety Level
Four site in the region,

00:07:03,936 --> 00:07:05,941
equipped to handle the
deadliest organisms.

00:07:05,941 --> 00:07:08,213
CDC brought us in to
assist on this case.

00:07:08,213 --> 00:07:09,615
So your lab's gonna tell us

00:07:09,615 --> 00:07:11,520
what kind of bug we're
dealing with here, right?

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,593
Because two of my team
may have been infected.

00:07:14,593 --> 00:07:15,629
I understand.

00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:16,998
If I can start
with a look

00:07:16,998 --> 00:07:18,068
at the damage
inflicted...

00:07:18,068 --> 00:07:19,204
Okay, I got this.
Why don't you

00:07:19,204 --> 00:07:20,540
check in with
your team?
Right.

00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,076
Right this way, please.
Okay.

00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,283
(saw buzzing)

00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:31,998
Surgical scissors
would be safer.

00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:34,303
You risk puncturing your suit
with that blade

00:07:34,303 --> 00:07:36,809
and infecting
yourself.

00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:38,112
(saw stops buzzing)

00:07:38,112 --> 00:07:40,250
This is Dr. Lanning
from RyneLab.

00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,953
Helping with the case.

00:07:41,953 --> 00:07:43,992
I appreciate your concern,

00:07:43,992 --> 00:07:45,127
but believe me,
I've never cut

00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:46,831
more carefully in my life.

00:07:46,831 --> 00:07:49,103
ECKLIE:
So what do we have, Doc?

00:07:49,103 --> 00:07:50,306
Well, starting with
the gunshot wound,

00:07:50,306 --> 00:07:51,875
it's a through-and-through.

00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,312
There's no sooting or stippling.

00:07:53,312 --> 00:07:55,651
The entry wound is irregular.

00:07:55,651 --> 00:07:57,923
It suggests a ricochet
before impact.

00:08:00,127 --> 00:08:01,965
(saw buzzing)

00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:04,971
I found no I.D. or
possessions in his pockets,

00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:06,207
and there was
no print match

00:08:06,207 --> 00:08:07,209
through Mobile AFIS.

00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:08,580
ECKLIE:
So we're still not

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,982
even sure of his name.

00:08:09,982 --> 00:08:11,887
A true "Patient Zero."

00:08:11,887 --> 00:08:13,289
No way to build a profile...

00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:15,661
who or what he may have
had contact with.

00:08:19,737 --> 00:08:21,341
(exhales)

00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:31,196
ROBBINS:
The lungs are soft,

00:08:31,196 --> 00:08:32,833
hemorrhagic,

00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,071
and the spleen is mushy.

00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,944
Consistent with
a filovirus infection.

00:08:39,314 --> 00:08:41,351
Like Marburg
or Ebola.

00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:47,365
No. No, I disagree, Jules.

00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:48,969
I don't think
you should fly back.

00:08:48,969 --> 00:08:51,675
I mean, if this thing
turns into a real outbreak,

00:08:51,675 --> 00:08:53,980
I think you're better off
in Seattle.

00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,318
Well, how long till we have
an update on Sara and Greg?

00:08:56,318 --> 00:08:57,921
RUSSELL:
They're still being tested,

00:08:57,921 --> 00:08:59,324
so they couldn't take any calls.

00:08:59,324 --> 00:09:01,062
I wish there was something
I could do to help.

00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:02,064
I know.

00:09:02,064 --> 00:09:03,734
You could tell me

00:09:03,734 --> 00:09:06,641
you've found something
on our Gig Harbor twins.

00:09:06,641 --> 00:09:08,645
I am still trying
to put together

00:09:08,645 --> 00:09:10,950
Winthrop and Briscoe's
backgrounds.

00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,687
You know, both men have lived

00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:14,057
without leaving much of a trail.

00:09:14,057 --> 00:09:16,429
But I'm going through
hospital records right now,

00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:18,868
and searching
for identical twins

00:09:18,868 --> 00:09:21,807
born to unwed Seattle mothers.

00:09:21,807 --> 00:09:24,213
Ages that would obviously
be right for them.

00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:25,916
You know,
I just need a birth date.

00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,453
It would really help me
with foster searches.

00:09:27,453 --> 00:09:29,290
All right. Well, it's a start.
Enough to keep fishing,

00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,362
don't you think?
Mm-hmm.

00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,366
Will you call me
if you hear anything?

00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:34,736
Of course I will.

00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,952
BRODY:
Hey.

00:09:41,952 --> 00:09:43,790
So I talked to
the CDC rep.

00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,059
I told him that
we need to be

00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:46,195
in that house
as soon as possible.

00:09:46,195 --> 00:09:47,464
I know all that
DNA evidence

00:09:47,464 --> 00:09:49,269
is gonna be destroyed.

00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:52,843
All we have right now are
the photos that they uploaded.

00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:55,315
Overalls, uh,
shots of blood spatter.

00:09:55,315 --> 00:09:57,487
I don't know what we're going
to get from these.

00:09:57,487 --> 00:09:58,889
Just like any other case,

00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,161
we need to find out
who this victim is first.

00:10:01,161 --> 00:10:04,202
Maybe some small detail will
tell us where he's been,

00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:05,470
who he's been
hanging out with...

00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,472
Who else might
have been infected.

00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:07,475
Yeah, exactly.

00:10:07,475 --> 00:10:09,213
So I'm just
scanning these,

00:10:09,213 --> 00:10:11,217
looking for an
I.D. badge,

00:10:11,217 --> 00:10:12,353
a piece of mail...
Yeah.

00:10:12,353 --> 00:10:13,990
Wait. What about
that book?

00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,994
<i>Seconds to Apocalypse.</i>

00:10:15,994 --> 00:10:17,764
Yeah, it's got a library tag
on the spine.

00:10:17,764 --> 00:10:19,435
That might
just work.
He might have

00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:20,738
a-an account
at the library.

00:10:20,738 --> 00:10:22,275
It could help us
with the I.D.
Yeah.

00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:23,310
It's worth a shot.
(phone chiming)

00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,381
Yeah, there's Russell.

00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:26,417
He's in Layout.

00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,753
He's got some news.
Let's go.

00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:28,755
Yeah.

00:10:30,526 --> 00:10:31,528
LANNING:
Sara.

00:10:31,528 --> 00:10:32,898
Greg.

00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,468
I'm here to tell you
that RyneLab

00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,239
has identified
the pathogen.

00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,947
EMMETT:
It's called the Ibare virus.

00:10:39,947 --> 00:10:41,484
A blood-borne filovirus,

00:10:41,484 --> 00:10:43,856
not unlike Ebola
in viral structure.

00:10:43,856 --> 00:10:45,927
<i>It replicates</i>
<i>at a staggering rate,</i>

00:10:45,927 --> 00:10:47,831
<i>decimating the host's cells</i>

00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:50,002
<i>and causing massive hemorrhage.</i>

00:10:50,002 --> 00:10:51,306
SIDLE:
<i>Are there treatments?</i>

00:10:51,306 --> 00:10:52,508
Antivirals?

00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,550
Nothing effective.

00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,891
So you know everything
about the virus

00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:01,127
except what to do about it.

00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,499
How does this virus end up here?

00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:04,368
CDC is baffled.

00:11:04,368 --> 00:11:05,470
The only prior outbreaks

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,441
were in rural South
American villages.

00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:09,044
Vegas is a global city.

00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,116
People come here from places
all over the world.

00:11:11,116 --> 00:11:12,886
Right.
And head back to those places,

00:11:12,886 --> 00:11:14,490
if you want to play
a nightmare scenario.

00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,862
All it takes is one
infected carrier.

00:11:16,862 --> 00:11:18,031
Sneezes in line
at the airport.

00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:19,534
<i>Infecting half a dozen more.</i>

00:11:19,534 --> 00:11:21,171
<i>By the time the wheels are up,</i>

00:11:21,171 --> 00:11:23,343
<i>the pathogen's on planes</i>
<i>to four continents.</i>

00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:25,114
<i>That's just getting started.</i>

00:11:25,114 --> 00:11:28,354
Ibare has a rapid incubation
period: within 48 hours.

00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,427
If you experience a fever,
muscle soreness...

00:11:31,427 --> 00:11:32,530
The fatality rate.

00:11:36,973 --> 00:11:38,008
80 percent.

00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:42,084
80 percent?

00:11:42,084 --> 00:11:43,254
Yes.

00:11:45,024 --> 00:11:46,494
Thank you, Doctor.
Appreciate that.

00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:52,607
There's nothing we can do
about Greg or Sara right now

00:11:52,607 --> 00:11:54,311
except just...

00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:55,313
just wait.

00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:58,187
So let's-let's
focus on the case.

00:11:58,187 --> 00:12:00,926
Somebody else walked out
of that bloody room.

00:12:00,926 --> 00:12:02,463
Yeah, the killer.
Who could be anywhere

00:12:02,463 --> 00:12:04,233
in the city now
just spreading the infection.

00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:05,636
STOKES: Quicker we
determine who that is

00:12:05,636 --> 00:12:06,338
and where they are...

00:12:06,338 --> 00:12:09,010
Better chance we have
at stopping this outbreak.

00:12:10,614 --> 00:12:11,216
All right.

00:12:26,115 --> 00:12:27,451
SIDLE:
<i>Don't let your mind go there.</i>

00:12:27,451 --> 00:12:28,621
That did not happen.

00:12:28,621 --> 00:12:29,656
We were careful.

00:12:29,656 --> 00:12:31,460
We always are,
working with blood.

00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,362
I know.

00:12:32,362 --> 00:12:34,567
We had a scare
like this before.

00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:37,506
Yeah, the dead jock with the
killer mold in his wall.

00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,678
A quick shared shower
in the middle of the street,

00:12:39,678 --> 00:12:40,981
and we were fine, right?

00:12:40,981 --> 00:12:43,219
This might not be that easy.

00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:44,522
We're going to be fine.

00:12:44,522 --> 00:12:46,126
(computer beeping)

00:12:47,161 --> 00:12:48,263
Hello, Nick?

00:12:48,263 --> 00:12:50,937
Hey! How are my two
favorite people doing?

00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,074
Happy for the distraction.

00:12:53,074 --> 00:12:55,112
Yeah, I heard they hooked you
guys up with some computers.

00:12:55,112 --> 00:12:56,649
Is that right?

00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:58,085
Yeah. How's the
case going?

00:12:58,085 --> 00:13:01,159
Well, we just caught
a break on the victim's I.D.

00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,963
Got it off of a library book

00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:05,501
from the photos
you guys uploaded.

00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:07,607
Registered to a guy
named Jack Weaver.

00:13:07,607 --> 00:13:08,709
And listen.

00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:11,281
This is not this guy's
first encounter

00:13:11,281 --> 00:13:13,386
with a microscopic killer,
if you know what I mean.

00:13:13,386 --> 00:13:14,688
SIDLE:
"Hunting Viruses.

00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:16,593
"Dr. Jack Weaver
travels the world

00:13:16,593 --> 00:13:18,664
stalking the planet's
deadliest organisms."

00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:22,038
Yeah, now, that article
is from about eight years ago.

00:13:22,038 --> 00:13:26,382
That's right around the time
his trail starts to fade.

00:13:26,382 --> 00:13:27,484
There's no employment records,

00:13:27,484 --> 00:13:29,454
no Internet presence, nothing.

00:13:29,454 --> 00:13:31,293
So, what happened to him?

00:13:31,293 --> 00:13:32,328
I'm not sure about that,

00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:34,733
but I do know somebody
that has the answer.

00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:36,370
Should have told us already.

00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,441
That is Heather Lanning.

00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:41,147
Uh, she's an old coworker
of Weaver's.

00:13:41,147 --> 00:13:44,087
They used to do some research
together over at RyneLab.

00:13:44,087 --> 00:13:46,058
And listen, she was in autopsy,

00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,361
she saw the body

00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:50,501
and never mentioned once
that she knew the guy.

00:13:51,303 --> 00:13:52,472
MAN:
As counsel for RyneLab,

00:13:52,472 --> 00:13:54,777
I want to be clear
that Miss Lanning is here

00:13:54,777 --> 00:13:57,616
in the spirit of cooperation
to aid in the investigation.

00:13:57,616 --> 00:13:59,555
Where was that spirit when you

00:13:59,555 --> 00:14:02,661
neglected to identify
Jack Weaver's body?

00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,301
I didn't realize...

00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:07,706
Ma'am, you worked
with him for years.

00:14:07,706 --> 00:14:09,443
No, RyneLab employs
over 500 individuals

00:14:09,443 --> 00:14:11,414
along with countless
affiliated...

00:14:11,414 --> 00:14:13,118
That face is...

00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,388
a ghost...

00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:15,790
of the man I knew.

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,793
So you knew him.

00:14:16,793 --> 00:14:18,730
Thank you.

00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,367
Why don't you tell me about him.

00:14:20,367 --> 00:14:22,806
Jack was brilliant.

00:14:22,806 --> 00:14:24,743
He made breakthroughs
in viral research

00:14:24,743 --> 00:14:27,784
that we're still wrapping
our heads around.

00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,322
But the fieldwork...

00:14:30,322 --> 00:14:31,759
RyneLab's global
outreach sends

00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:34,331
researchers around the world
to sites of epidemics...

00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,605
Weeks spent slogging, neck-deep,
in disease.

00:14:37,605 --> 00:14:40,344
Watching mothers fight
for a last embrace

00:14:40,344 --> 00:14:43,418
of their dying child.

00:14:43,418 --> 00:14:45,757
Those trips took a toll on Jack.

00:14:45,757 --> 00:14:48,362
Even when we were back
safe in the lab,

00:14:48,362 --> 00:14:50,366
he wasn't the same.

00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:51,736
Eventually, he had to be let go.

00:14:51,736 --> 00:14:53,173
It was a tragedy...

00:14:53,173 --> 00:14:54,175
which...

00:14:55,512 --> 00:14:57,516
...apparently continued.

00:14:59,186 --> 00:15:02,794
A virus hunter
becomes the virus-hunted,

00:15:02,794 --> 00:15:04,364
years after the job
is left behind.

00:15:04,364 --> 00:15:06,836
So how did his old prey
catch up with him?

00:15:06,836 --> 00:15:09,175
Ibare has never been
discovered in the U.S.

00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,310
Weaver's passport records

00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,182
don't show any recent
international travel.

00:15:12,182 --> 00:15:13,852
The only specimens

00:15:13,852 --> 00:15:15,789
of the virus within
a thousand miles

00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,593
were the ones in
RyneLab's freezers.

00:15:17,593 --> 00:15:19,565
All of which have been
inventoried and accounted for.

00:15:19,565 --> 00:15:21,536
None went missing.

00:15:21,536 --> 00:15:23,273
Wait a minute.
You're saying that this company

00:15:23,273 --> 00:15:25,711
keeps a stockpile of this virus
here in Nevada?

00:15:25,711 --> 00:15:27,148
That's exactly what I'm saying.

00:15:27,148 --> 00:15:29,286
With the Defense Department's
blessing, of course,

00:15:29,286 --> 00:15:30,187
and generous funding.

00:15:30,187 --> 00:15:30,789
Why?

00:15:30,789 --> 00:15:33,295
Military can't use biological
weapons like that.

00:15:33,295 --> 00:15:33,829
Exactly.

00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:37,805
Which is why the program goes
under the heading "Bio-Defense."

00:15:37,805 --> 00:15:41,546
See, this company cultivates
and studies these organisms

00:15:41,546 --> 00:15:43,718
to prepare for the
awfulpossibility

00:15:43,718 --> 00:15:46,657
that one day they may
wind up on U.S. soil.

00:15:46,657 --> 00:15:48,462
BRODY:
Hey.

00:15:48,462 --> 00:15:51,268
Police records popped
something on Jack Weaver.

00:15:51,268 --> 00:15:52,538
Field investigation card

00:15:52,538 --> 00:15:54,342
from last week.

00:15:54,342 --> 00:15:56,579
Officer responded to a street
where Weaver was drunk

00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:57,582
and prophesizing

00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:58,584
<i>about a plague.</i>

00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:00,756
Plague!
The world is bleeding!

00:16:00,756 --> 00:16:02,426
(siren whoops)

00:16:02,426 --> 00:16:04,330
Cop just told him to move on.

00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,869
And a week later his prophecy
came true, at least for him.

00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:08,706
Well, let's not forget,
now, he was shot.

00:16:08,706 --> 00:16:10,477
I can't help but believe
that this shooting

00:16:10,477 --> 00:16:12,214
and the infection are
related in some way.

00:16:12,214 --> 00:16:13,183
What are you thinking?

00:16:13,183 --> 00:16:14,452
Weaver was broke and bitter,

00:16:14,452 --> 00:16:17,191
but he still knew a lot
about deadly pathogens.

00:16:17,191 --> 00:16:19,497
May have even had access to
one of those connections.

00:16:19,497 --> 00:16:22,570
Maybe making him the perfect
wingman for a bioterrorist.

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,606
Exactly.

00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:25,744
Yeah, but the only terror so far

00:16:25,744 --> 00:16:27,348
happened to Weaver himself.

00:16:27,348 --> 00:16:29,720
So, something goes
awry with the plan.

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,755
Second thoughts.

00:16:30,755 --> 00:16:32,292
Sloppy execution.

00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,229
Weaver ends up infected.

00:16:34,229 --> 00:16:35,966
Coconspirator shoots
him to silence him.

00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:40,410
And that same person makes
off with the viral ammo.

00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,679
I saw something in the photos.

00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,650
I wasn't sure what it was.
I think I do now.

00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,655
Here.

00:16:45,655 --> 00:16:47,358
The void in the blood.

00:16:47,358 --> 00:16:48,695
It's rectangular.

00:16:48,695 --> 00:16:49,731
It's got round corners.

00:16:49,731 --> 00:16:51,367
Could very easily
be a briefcase.

00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:54,875
BRODY: <i>The kind you might use</i>
<i>to transport a deadly pathogen.</i>

00:16:56,378 --> 00:16:58,416
Conrad, we need to get
in that house ASAP.

00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,421
No.

00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:02,492
CDC is saying
it's not safe yet.

00:17:02,492 --> 00:17:04,295
Yeah, but it's safer
than leaving a killer

00:17:04,295 --> 00:17:06,234
and a deadly virus
on the street.

00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:09,006
Well, you put it that way...

00:17:09,006 --> 00:17:10,978
(phone beeping)

00:17:10,978 --> 00:17:13,349
I'll get you in there.

00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:15,454
BRODY:
The UV light and formaldehyde

00:17:15,454 --> 00:17:17,859
nuked all biologicals,
so there's no DNA.

00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,429
And no virus.

00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:20,933
STOKES:
Everything's just
how they left it.

00:17:22,435 --> 00:17:24,574
Lead would still survive.

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,817
Gunshot was a
through-and-through, right?

00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:31,289
Yeah. So there should
still be a bullet here.

00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:32,959
Okay. Let's go to work.

00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:34,529
Body was right here.

00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:38,572
Robbins' report said that

00:17:38,572 --> 00:17:40,509
the bullet was ricocheted
into the vic, right?

00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:42,547
Right.
Well, there's a...

00:17:42,547 --> 00:17:45,386
there's a bullet skip mark
here on the floor.

00:17:45,386 --> 00:17:46,656
Impacted at a low angle.

00:17:46,656 --> 00:17:49,696
For Weaver to get shot
in the neck means...

00:17:49,696 --> 00:17:50,899
he must have been
laying down.

00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:53,404
Yeah.

00:17:53,404 --> 00:17:55,810
STOKES: Which means the bullet
would have to stay low.

00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:02,558
Oh... Morgan.

00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:03,995
I think I've
got something.

00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:08,404
I just found the bullet.

00:18:10,776 --> 00:18:12,747
BRODY: Greg marked the case
right here by the door.

00:18:12,747 --> 00:18:14,384
Killer would have needed

00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,391
some distance to account for
the low-angle bullet skip, so...

00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:20,598
Shooter stands here...

00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:25,776
<i>Fires at Weaver, who's prone,</i>
<i>sick on the ground.</i>

00:18:27,546 --> 00:18:29,851
<i>Takes off with the briefcase.</i>

00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:31,890
And whatever lurks inside of it.

00:18:32,925 --> 00:18:34,529
That works.

00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:39,406
Clock is ticking, Sara.

00:18:43,381 --> 00:18:44,651
It's your move.

00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:48,760
What if it is starting?

00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,397
An epidemic.

00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:53,637
What if yesterday
was the last normal day?

00:18:56,543 --> 00:19:01,354
What happened to the optimist
who used to share this fishbowl?

00:19:02,424 --> 00:19:04,094
I'm just thinking.

00:19:04,828 --> 00:19:08,404
You know how quickly
everything could change.

00:19:08,404 --> 00:19:09,806
You have a headache or a fever.

00:19:09,806 --> 00:19:12,011
You think it's just
a day off of work.

00:19:12,011 --> 00:19:13,080
Instead...

00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,985
You're booking a
trip to Costa Rica.

00:19:14,985 --> 00:19:17,122
'Cause when we're
cleared from here,

00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:18,559
something good's
gonna happen.

00:19:20,563 --> 00:19:22,100
Motivation for a vacation.

00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,510
Is that really what it takes?

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:30,018
Something like this?

00:19:30,018 --> 00:19:32,089
To do the things
you've been putting off.

00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:39,706
I'll take reminders
where we can get them.

00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,592
Hmm. Booking your own
tropical vacation?

00:19:48,726 --> 00:19:49,728
Not exactly.

00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:53,871
WOMAN:
Greg?

00:19:53,871 --> 00:19:54,939
Hi, Grandma.

00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:55,941
How have you been?

00:19:55,941 --> 00:19:57,078
Good.

00:19:57,078 --> 00:19:58,681
So nice of you
to check in on me.

00:19:58,681 --> 00:19:59,917
How are you?

00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:02,656
I, uh...

00:20:02,656 --> 00:20:04,059
It's been an interesting day.

00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:05,796
Looks sunny there.

00:20:05,796 --> 00:20:07,133
It's been nice all morning.

00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:09,171
The garden looks great.

00:20:09,171 --> 00:20:13,013
Yeah? Well, that's actually
why I was calling.

00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:14,883
Thinking about coming up there

00:20:14,883 --> 00:20:17,222
to see you and
check it out.

00:20:17,222 --> 00:20:19,894
Oh, Greg, I would love that.

00:20:19,894 --> 00:20:22,033
Me, too.

00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:23,202
RUSSELL:
Heard you found a match

00:20:23,202 --> 00:20:24,638
on the bullet
that killed Weaver.

00:20:24,638 --> 00:20:26,542
Yep. A recovered round
from a gas station holdup

00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:27,946
six months ago.

00:20:27,946 --> 00:20:32,155
Case wasn't solved, but we did
have a very strong suspect.

00:20:32,155 --> 00:20:35,596
Northtown nuisance
Shawn Steubens.

00:20:35,596 --> 00:20:37,734
Priors for weapons
violations,

00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:38,903
robbery.

00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:40,808
Doesn't look like
a bioterrorist.

00:20:40,808 --> 00:20:42,010
Agreed.

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,914
Let's get him to prove us wrong.

00:20:49,995 --> 00:20:50,997
Shawn Steubens.

00:20:50,997 --> 00:20:52,600
LVPD.

00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,569
Open up.

00:20:54,271 --> 00:20:55,841
Shawn!

00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:58,647
It's very important
that we talk to you!

00:20:59,683 --> 00:21:03,090
(faint groaning from inside)

00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,638
(faint groaning from inside)

00:21:24,871 --> 00:21:26,608
STOKES:
This guy's infected.

00:21:40,272 --> 00:21:42,878
Tell me that's the cure.

00:21:42,878 --> 00:21:43,947
It's for your pain.

00:21:45,117 --> 00:21:46,586
And then what?

00:21:53,735 --> 00:21:55,639
You want to tell me
what happened?

00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:01,152
Shawn, what's
happening to you

00:22:01,152 --> 00:22:03,189
may be happening
to other people.

00:22:05,094 --> 00:22:06,631
It may be
happening to...

00:22:08,301 --> 00:22:10,673
...two friends of mine

00:22:10,673 --> 00:22:13,011
that I care about very much.

00:22:18,156 --> 00:22:21,062
Shawn...

00:22:21,062 --> 00:22:22,332
I'm begging you, man.

00:22:22,332 --> 00:22:24,336
Help us out here.

00:22:27,877 --> 00:22:30,115
Driving around
the other night, late...

00:22:31,251 --> 00:22:33,656
...saw someone go
into that house,

00:22:33,656 --> 00:22:34,826
wearing a big rubber suit

00:22:34,826 --> 00:22:36,262
like the guys
who brought me here.

00:22:36,262 --> 00:22:38,200
A Hazmat suit?

00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,704
Going <i>in</i> Jack Weaver's house?

00:22:39,704 --> 00:22:40,772
Yeah.

00:22:40,772 --> 00:22:43,411
That suit,
that part of town, I...

00:22:43,411 --> 00:22:46,017
figured they had
a meth cook going on inside.

00:22:46,017 --> 00:22:49,091
Then what'd you do, Shawn?

00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:51,329
Grabbed my nine-mil.

00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:54,703
<i>Went in to rip the place off.</i>

00:22:54,703 --> 00:22:57,844
<i>Saw what was really inside.</i>

00:22:57,844 --> 00:22:59,346
<i>Briefcase looked important.</i>

00:22:59,346 --> 00:23:01,051
<i>So I grabbed it.</i>

00:23:01,051 --> 00:23:04,425
<i>I figured maybe it</i>
<i>was stuffed with cash.</i>

00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:07,197
<i>Then that suit</i>
<i>was coming at me.</i>

00:23:07,197 --> 00:23:08,968
<i>I panicked.</i>

00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,946
Shooting that guy
was an accident. I swear.

00:23:17,086 --> 00:23:19,391
You didn't get
a good look...

00:23:19,391 --> 00:23:21,763
at who was in that
Hazmat suit, did you?

00:23:21,763 --> 00:23:23,701
No face, no eyes.

00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:25,271
And the briefcase,
what happened to that?

00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:28,277
It's at my house.

00:23:28,277 --> 00:23:30,850
Spent a little while
trying to bust it open.

00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,754
Kind of lost interest

00:23:32,754 --> 00:23:36,997
in the briefcase when, you know,
my eyes started bleeding.

00:23:40,772 --> 00:23:44,780
Well, I'm...
I'm gonna leave you to it.

00:23:49,324 --> 00:23:52,798
Amateur video from the
scene shows CDC vehicles

00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,039
and personnel at the
North Las Vegas residence.

00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,879
Officials have not released
details of what drew

00:23:58,879 --> 00:24:02,753
this emergency response,
but sources report that...

00:24:02,753 --> 00:24:03,890
The story's still under wraps.

00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,292
At least nobody's panicking.

00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:06,194
Additionally, it's reported

00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,801
that two veteran Crime Scene
Investigators were...

00:24:08,801 --> 00:24:10,504
Did she just call
us "veteran"?

00:24:10,504 --> 00:24:13,243
'Cause now I might panic.

00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:16,918
I can turn this off
if it's bugging you.

00:24:16,918 --> 00:24:19,090
No. No, no,
it's fine.

00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:19,390
...spokesperson isn't releasing
any information

00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,395
on their condition at this time.

00:24:21,395 --> 00:24:23,232
Desert Palm and other
local hospitals

00:24:23,232 --> 00:24:25,069
declined to comment

00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:26,473
when asked if they
had recently...

00:24:26,473 --> 00:24:30,080
Sara? Are you...?

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,054
Sara! Sara!

00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:36,361
We need a doctor!

00:24:36,361 --> 00:24:37,396
Sara!

00:24:37,396 --> 00:24:38,933
Somebody!

00:24:38,933 --> 00:24:40,904
Somebody, please help!

00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,013
Sara! Sara!

00:24:46,116 --> 00:24:47,920
(muffled):
Sara!

00:24:55,938 --> 00:24:56,973
SANDERS:
Hey, Russell.

00:24:56,973 --> 00:24:59,279
RUSSELL:
Hi.

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,851
They said that you have a...

00:25:01,851 --> 00:25:04,958
100.4... fever.

00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:07,362
But her viral antibody tests
are still negative,

00:25:07,362 --> 00:25:11,004
so it could just be a common bug
or the stress of all this or...

00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:16,416
I'm so sorry.

00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:19,523
They wouldn't let me
come any sooner.

00:25:19,523 --> 00:25:22,563
We know.

00:25:25,502 --> 00:25:30,213
Russell, I need you
to do something for me.

00:25:30,213 --> 00:25:31,984
Yeah, of course.
Anything.

00:25:35,592 --> 00:25:37,396
If we're gonna die,

00:25:37,396 --> 00:25:40,035
we need to go out
fighting, okay?

00:25:40,035 --> 00:25:42,607
So, put us to work.

00:25:45,547 --> 00:25:48,553
Neither one of you have
my permission to die.

00:25:50,892 --> 00:25:52,897
You got that?

00:25:55,436 --> 00:25:57,640
All right. Uh...

00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,380
Morgan recovered the
stolen briefcase.

00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,621
The only thing in it was
Jack Weaver's computer.

00:26:03,621 --> 00:26:05,391
She'll upload
his hard drive.

00:26:05,391 --> 00:26:06,460
She'll get it to you guys.

00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,932
Yeah, we'll start digging.

00:26:21,593 --> 00:26:24,367
♪&amp; ♪&amp;

00:26:41,237 --> 00:26:44,477
RUSSELL:
So, you found anything
interesting yet?

00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:47,951
Well, Jack Weaver was
obsessed with the Ibare virus

00:26:47,951 --> 00:26:49,422
long before he was
infected with it.

00:26:49,422 --> 00:26:50,625
His Web histories,

00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:51,994
cached articles,

00:26:51,994 --> 00:26:54,099
all dwell on that
particular pathogen.

00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:56,003
SIDLE:
Especially one
outbreak of it

00:26:56,003 --> 00:26:57,105
in 2006.

00:26:57,105 --> 00:26:59,077
The disease tore
through a village

00:26:59,077 --> 00:27:00,112
in Bolivia
called Campiza.

00:27:00,112 --> 00:27:02,250
We know why this
was Jack's focus?

00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,323
He did witness
the carnage firsthand.

00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:08,397
He and Heather Lanning
were sent to the village

00:27:08,397 --> 00:27:11,002
to study the outbreak
and help with the infected.

00:27:11,002 --> 00:27:14,176
Yeah, but Weaver did fieldwork
at a lot of those outbreaks

00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:17,050
which is why he burned out,
according to Lanning.

00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,321
Wha-What makes that
one different?

00:27:19,321 --> 00:27:21,659
Yeah, we're not sure yet,
though, speaking of Lanning,

00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:24,600
Weaver had been e-mailing
with her right up to a week ago.

00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,737
She told me that she hadn't
spoken to him for years.

00:27:26,737 --> 00:27:29,109
Weaver was sending
her ramblingmessages

00:27:29,109 --> 00:27:30,746
saying that they had
to talk about Bolivia.

00:27:30,746 --> 00:27:32,083
Lanning shut him down.

00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,154
"Jack, you're a troubled man.

00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:36,159
You need help.
You need to move on."

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,163
That was five days
before we found him dead.

00:27:38,163 --> 00:27:39,566
RUSSELL:
Okay, now,
Lanning said

00:27:39,566 --> 00:27:40,768
she didn't recognize
Weaver's body,

00:27:40,768 --> 00:27:42,172
and I let that slide.

00:27:42,172 --> 00:27:44,410
But obviously she's
hiding something.

00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:45,612
MAN:
Mr. Russell?

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,523
Yeah.
My name is Rudy Adela.

00:27:50,523 --> 00:27:52,093
We met earlier.

00:27:52,093 --> 00:27:53,730
Yeah, you're the attorney
for RyneLab, right?

00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,768
I was informed by our
research tech at RyneLab

00:27:55,768 --> 00:27:57,338
of a missing agent.

00:27:57,338 --> 00:27:59,410
A vial of the Ibare virus.

00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:05,456
You got something there?

00:28:07,327 --> 00:28:10,534
I, uh, asked
Dr. Lanning about it.

00:28:13,741 --> 00:28:15,178
(click, beep)

00:28:15,178 --> 00:28:16,781
LANNING:
Rudy, the loss cannot
be reported.

00:28:16,781 --> 00:28:18,685
ADELA:
We can't just ignore it.

00:28:18,685 --> 00:28:21,224
LANNING:
You don't say a word to anyone.

00:28:21,224 --> 00:28:24,698
How much was in that vial?
It's ten cc's.

00:28:24,698 --> 00:28:27,605
20 million
virion particles.

00:28:29,242 --> 00:28:31,179
And each one
a potential death sentence.

00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:40,199
Your company lost a potential
weapon of mass destruction,

00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:41,503
and then you covered it up,

00:28:41,503 --> 00:28:42,805
at the very least.

00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:45,110
What are you
accusing me of?

00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,514
I'm here without an attorney.

00:28:46,514 --> 00:28:48,151
Doesn't that tell you
something about my...

00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:52,260
Tells me something about your
attorney's conscience, actually.

00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,863
Now, contrary
to what you told us,

00:28:53,863 --> 00:28:56,669
you were in contact
with Jack Weaver.

00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:57,671
These are the e-mails.

00:28:57,671 --> 00:28:59,710
He wanted to talk
to you about Bolivia.

00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,513
I told you he wasn't stable.

00:29:01,513 --> 00:29:02,817
He needed help.

00:29:02,817 --> 00:29:06,458
Ms. Lanning, we're
working with the CDC now,

00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:08,161
under a federal order.

00:29:08,161 --> 00:29:11,202
As we speak, we're tearing
apart your offices.

00:29:11,202 --> 00:29:13,474
Every file,
every hard drive.

00:29:13,474 --> 00:29:15,211
And we just got this in

00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,680
from your building
surveillance.

00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,353
That's you walking
Jack Weaver

00:29:19,353 --> 00:29:20,856
into the facility,
after hours,

00:29:20,856 --> 00:29:22,694
a week before he died.

00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,364
I thought bringing
him there, talking,

00:29:24,364 --> 00:29:26,435
might remind him of all
the good work he did.

00:29:26,435 --> 00:29:28,139
No, that's not true.

00:29:28,139 --> 00:29:29,675
Once again,
these are the e-mails.

00:29:29,675 --> 00:29:31,747
He demanded
to meet you there.

00:29:31,747 --> 00:29:33,684
And because you
went along with it,

00:29:33,684 --> 00:29:35,588
I'm guessing he had
some sort of leverage.

00:29:35,588 --> 00:29:37,660
He had my pity.

00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,697
I was trying to help him.

00:29:39,697 --> 00:29:43,606
Ms. Lanning, a man who's
obsessed with the Ibare virus

00:29:43,606 --> 00:29:45,177
visits the lab.

00:29:45,177 --> 00:29:47,782
A vial of that virus
goes missing.

00:29:47,782 --> 00:29:50,889
And that same pathogen
kills him within days.

00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,593
You think he...

00:29:52,593 --> 00:29:54,197
No.

00:29:54,197 --> 00:29:56,735
I didn't let him near anywhere
near the specimen storage.

00:29:56,735 --> 00:29:59,374
So, he was never out of your
sight, even for a moment?

00:29:59,374 --> 00:30:01,480
Maybe for... two minutes.

00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,250
He went to use the
men's room, but...

00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,319
Uh-huh, yeah.

00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:06,757
That man had worked
in that building for years.

00:30:06,757 --> 00:30:08,461
He knew how to
access the specimens.

00:30:08,461 --> 00:30:10,867
He could have gotten in
and out of there in two minutes.

00:30:10,867 --> 00:30:12,871
And you know it.

00:30:14,207 --> 00:30:16,346
Here's what I think.

00:30:16,346 --> 00:30:18,818
I believe that you
realized your mistake,

00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:21,490
so you went to his home.

00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,461
You wanted to keep
track of Jack

00:30:23,461 --> 00:30:24,898
and the missing vial.

00:30:24,898 --> 00:30:25,933
Kind of damage control.

00:30:25,933 --> 00:30:26,969
No! That's not...

00:30:26,969 --> 00:30:28,907
By the time
you got there,

00:30:28,907 --> 00:30:31,546
Jack Weaver had already
infected himself.

00:30:31,546 --> 00:30:32,815
And what?

00:30:32,815 --> 00:30:34,553
I just let him die?

00:30:34,553 --> 00:30:35,821
That's what I think, yeah.

00:30:35,821 --> 00:30:38,294
I think you realized
that if your mistake came out

00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,232
that your labs
would be shut down.

00:30:40,232 --> 00:30:42,771
So you watched him
crash and bleed out.

00:30:42,771 --> 00:30:45,310
<i>And then you were gonna</i>
<i>dispose of his body,</i>

00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,815
<i>but someone came along</i>
<i>and ruined your plan.</i>

00:30:51,256 --> 00:30:52,659
<i>So you panicked...</i>

00:30:52,659 --> 00:30:54,930
and you left behind
the body and the blood

00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:57,670
for my CSIs to walk into.

00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,244
I'm done talking about it.

00:31:01,244 --> 00:31:02,413
I want an attorney.

00:31:02,413 --> 00:31:03,950
Good idea.

00:31:04,017 --> 00:31:05,955
Russell spins
a hell of a theory,

00:31:05,955 --> 00:31:08,561
but we still don't know
why Weaver took the vial

00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:09,931
or how he ended
up infected.

00:31:09,931 --> 00:31:11,801
I think infecting
himself with that virus

00:31:11,801 --> 00:31:12,903
was the whole point.

00:31:12,903 --> 00:31:14,540
Conrad, he knew the dangers.

00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,576
This was no accident.

00:31:15,576 --> 00:31:16,846
What do you mean?

00:31:16,846 --> 00:31:19,618
I'm saying that Weaver knew
something about RyneLab,

00:31:19,618 --> 00:31:20,587
something major.

00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:21,823
What?
I don't know yet,

00:31:21,823 --> 00:31:24,029
but he hints about it
in his e-mails.

00:31:24,029 --> 00:31:25,899
I think exposing
himself to this virus

00:31:25,899 --> 00:31:28,003
was his way of exposing
that whole company.

00:31:28,003 --> 00:31:29,741
All right, so he
got our attention.

00:31:29,741 --> 00:31:31,310
What did he want
us to know?

00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,549
Morgan and I are going
over the files right now,

00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:35,988
but my gut tells me
'06 Bolivian outbreak

00:31:35,988 --> 00:31:37,792
seems to have been
his obsession.

00:31:37,792 --> 00:31:40,030
Well, let's make it
our obsession-- and quickly.

00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,068
RyneLab's got
a lot of juice in DC.

00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:44,406
Our investigation could
get shut down any minute.

00:31:44,406 --> 00:31:45,443
I'm on it.

00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,828
STOKES:
Hey.

00:31:54,963 --> 00:31:57,001
Reports all tell
the same tale.

00:31:57,001 --> 00:32:00,342
Lanning and Weaver arrived
at the Bolivian village two days

00:32:00,342 --> 00:32:02,881
after the first
infections were reported,

00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:05,018
identified
the pathogen as Ibare.

00:32:05,018 --> 00:32:07,624
Yeah, they treated and contained
the sick in a field hospital.

00:32:07,624 --> 00:32:09,896
20 infected, 17 dead.

00:32:09,896 --> 00:32:12,803
Then the virus just
ran its course.

00:32:12,803 --> 00:32:14,640
Her field reports, her journals,
they're all consistent.

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,647
So, what are we missing?

00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:37,390
What is it?

00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,963
It was collected from
Lanning's desk at RyneLab.

00:32:39,963 --> 00:32:41,733
What is that?

00:32:41,733 --> 00:32:43,136
It's from Bolivia,

00:32:43,136 --> 00:32:45,843
to Heather's home address here.

00:32:45,843 --> 00:32:47,145
Postmarked...

00:32:47,145 --> 00:32:48,815
around the end
of the outbreak.

00:32:51,755 --> 00:32:54,829
It's a letter
from Heather to herself.

00:32:54,829 --> 00:32:56,433
Why would somebody do
something like that?

00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,572
Because she couldn't
tell anybody else.

00:32:59,572 --> 00:33:01,544
Read it.

00:33:01,544 --> 00:33:05,553
"Let the reports
and lab records tally

00:33:05,553 --> 00:33:07,824
"the dead and the lucky.

00:33:07,824 --> 00:33:12,101
"But for my own sanity,
I need to put down what I saw.

00:33:12,101 --> 00:33:14,640
"To remember that it happened.

00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,677
So that it never happens again."

00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:21,554
It's not our call, Jack.

00:33:21,554 --> 00:33:22,723
The directive
for RyneLab was clear.

00:33:22,723 --> 00:33:24,495
Yeah. Lie to them.

00:33:24,495 --> 00:33:26,499
Tell these people
their family members

00:33:26,499 --> 00:33:27,802
aren't dying in there.

00:33:27,802 --> 00:33:30,040
We don't have the manpower
to deal with a panic.

00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,578
We need to maintain
the quarantine.

00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:33,748
MAN:
What is happening in there?

00:33:35,652 --> 00:33:37,724
(villagers speaking Spanish)

00:33:40,563 --> 00:33:42,534
You tell us nothing.

00:33:47,011 --> 00:33:48,948
It's a fever.

00:33:48,948 --> 00:33:50,618
It's just a fever.

00:33:50,618 --> 00:33:52,022
They're gonna be fine.

00:33:52,022 --> 00:33:54,561
Fever?

00:33:54,561 --> 00:33:57,634
(translating in Spanish)

00:33:57,634 --> 00:34:00,875
Then we will care
for them at home.

00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:03,013
No. You can't go in.

00:34:03,013 --> 00:34:04,850
We need to treat
them here.
(speaking Spanish)

00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,453
Stop!

00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,859
Please... don't
touch them! Wait.

00:34:08,859 --> 00:34:10,629
BRODY:
<i>"The official reports</i>

00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:11,665
<i>"will simply show</i>

00:34:11,665 --> 00:34:13,168
<i>"a spike of 15 new infections,</i>

00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:15,607
<i>"12 of them fatal.</i>

00:34:15,607 --> 00:34:17,044
"But Jack and I

00:34:17,044 --> 00:34:18,614
"about the numbers.

And we will have
to live with it."

00:34:24,928 --> 00:34:26,598
Well, it sounds like
she figured out

00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:28,202
how to live with it,
but he didn't.

00:34:28,202 --> 00:34:30,039
Well, suicide
wasn't enough.

00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:31,509
It's too easy.

00:34:31,509 --> 00:34:33,513
No, he infected himself
because he wanted

00:34:33,513 --> 00:34:35,952
to empathize with
these victims.

00:34:35,952 --> 00:34:37,990
To feel the pain
his lie caused.

00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,928
We have to prove it.

00:34:39,928 --> 00:34:41,832
We have to prove
that he stole the virus

00:34:41,832 --> 00:34:43,068
from RyneLab's facility.

00:34:55,662 --> 00:34:56,931
Any luck?

00:34:56,931 --> 00:34:58,870
One tiny partial print--
it won't be any help,

00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,239
except to tell us that...

00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:02,677
somebody opened this container
without wearing gloves.

00:35:02,677 --> 00:35:05,049
Well, the swabs I took
didn't find any touch DNA.

00:35:05,049 --> 00:35:07,622
No useable prints, no DNA.

00:35:10,729 --> 00:35:12,934
There is something
else to try.

00:35:12,934 --> 00:35:14,704
Morgan, what's unique
about this room?

00:35:14,704 --> 00:35:16,943
Freezers full of
exotic death.

00:35:16,943 --> 00:35:19,047
Aside from those
contained organisms,

00:35:19,047 --> 00:35:21,921
there's no life in here, but
the room's kept spotless.

00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:23,925
Every person who
enters, per protocol,

00:35:23,925 --> 00:35:25,261
is wrapped in rubber.

00:35:25,261 --> 00:35:26,998
Except for one person
who broke protocol.

00:35:26,998 --> 00:35:29,571
You're thinking
microbial forensics.

00:35:29,571 --> 00:35:30,806
You're familiar
with the process?

00:35:30,806 --> 00:35:32,109
I-I've read a little bit
about it, but...

00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:34,348
This is theperfect
chance to try it.

00:35:34,348 --> 00:35:36,252
The only microbes
living on that surface

00:35:36,252 --> 00:35:39,159
would have been contributed
by that single ungloved person.

00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:42,600
<i>Every person has a a unique mix</i>
<i>of organisms on their skin.</i>

00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,038
<i>Some they're born with,</i>
<i>some they accumulate.</i>

00:35:45,038 --> 00:35:48,713
<i>The combination is as singular</i>
<i>as a fingerprint or DNA.</i>

00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,583
Other scenes, there are
far too many microbes

00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:51,886
on every single surface

00:35:51,886 --> 00:35:52,989
to ever distinguish

00:35:52,989 --> 00:35:54,292
between contributors,
but here...

00:35:54,292 --> 00:35:55,629
There's only one contributor:

00:35:55,629 --> 00:35:57,198
whoever stole the virus.

00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:59,303
I'll call Russell...

00:35:59,303 --> 00:36:01,675
see if we can commandeer
RyneLab's equipment,

00:36:01,675 --> 00:36:03,045
do a microbial analysis.

00:36:27,131 --> 00:36:29,135
♪&amp; ♪&amp;

00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:47,142
So, I cultured
the microbial population

00:36:47,142 --> 00:36:50,383
from the swab...
I spread it over various agars,

00:36:50,383 --> 00:36:52,086
each formulated
to breed

00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:54,057
particular organisms
if they're present.

00:36:54,057 --> 00:36:56,162
Each positive I.D.
we get of a species

00:36:56,162 --> 00:36:59,336
gets us one step closer
to a microbial profile.

00:36:59,336 --> 00:37:00,338
And our suspect.

00:37:00,338 --> 00:37:02,375
Yeah.
(phone chimes)

00:37:04,982 --> 00:37:06,719
Hey, Nick. What's up?

00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:08,890
I was going over the
Bolivia files with Russell,

00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,093
you know, explaining everything.

00:37:10,093 --> 00:37:11,897
Yeah?
We noticed something

00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,434
in one of the photos
of the village.

00:37:13,434 --> 00:37:15,004
What?

00:37:15,004 --> 00:37:16,373
Prepare to have
your stomach drop.

00:37:18,311 --> 00:37:20,449
Eight years ago...

00:37:20,449 --> 00:37:22,052
half a world away...

00:37:22,052 --> 00:37:23,054
(sighs)

00:37:23,054 --> 00:37:24,724
...but...

00:37:24,724 --> 00:37:26,128
that's you.

00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,005
I haven't seen this photo.

00:37:31,005 --> 00:37:32,476
But I remember everything.

00:37:32,476 --> 00:37:33,946
Your family
were among those

00:37:33,946 --> 00:37:35,916
who were infected
in the village, right?

00:37:35,916 --> 00:37:38,121
Both of my parents...

00:37:38,121 --> 00:37:40,359
my sister...

00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:42,999
all killed.

00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:44,468
I was, um...

00:37:44,468 --> 00:37:45,905
theluckyone.

00:37:48,979 --> 00:37:50,949
Can't be a coincidence

00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:53,856
that you're working
for RyneLab now.

00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:55,994
Same organization
that handled the outbreak

00:37:55,994 --> 00:37:57,130
all those years ago.

00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:59,736
The company looked out for us.

00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,439
The kids left behind.

00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:03,377
Oh, I heard that.
I heard that they...

00:38:03,377 --> 00:38:05,849
they sent you to school
in La Paz, right?

00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:06,985
They...

00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:08,154
paid for your college?

00:38:09,357 --> 00:38:11,395
I wanted to work for them.

00:38:11,395 --> 00:38:13,098
Help study monsters

00:38:13,098 --> 00:38:14,535
like Ibare.

00:38:14,535 --> 00:38:16,874
Turns out I didn't have
a mind for science,

00:38:16,874 --> 00:38:19,111
but a law degree
got me in the door.

00:38:20,782 --> 00:38:22,485
Rudy...

00:38:22,485 --> 00:38:25,192
we know you found out
what happened in your village.

00:38:25,192 --> 00:38:27,063
I mean, the real story.

00:38:27,063 --> 00:38:30,003
We took your fingerprints off
of Heather Lanning's letter,

00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:33,276
which you found
hidden in her office.

00:38:33,276 --> 00:38:34,446
I heard rumors back then

00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:37,352
that RyneLab had caused
the deaths, so...

00:38:37,352 --> 00:38:39,223
I used my access
to get answers.

00:38:39,223 --> 00:38:42,329
And when you got your answers
and you found out that

00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:45,169
Jack Weaver was responsible,
you wanted revenge.

00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:46,840
I understand.

00:38:48,877 --> 00:38:50,849
Okay. Rudy...

00:38:50,849 --> 00:38:53,388
my CSIs have developed
a microbial profile

00:38:53,388 --> 00:38:56,995
of the hand that... that opened
the refrigeration unit

00:38:56,995 --> 00:38:58,967
and stole the vial
of Ibare.

00:38:58,967 --> 00:39:02,508
A zoo of different organisms
all living in harmony

00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:04,111
on a... on a fingertip.

00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:07,285
And that same unique
combination of life

00:39:07,285 --> 00:39:09,556
was found on this--
your recorder.

00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:14,000
You stole the vial, Rudy.

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,137
And you infected Jack Weaver.

00:39:19,445 --> 00:39:22,318
My entire family.

00:39:24,155 --> 00:39:25,959
They didn't deserve it.

00:39:27,496 --> 00:39:28,565
He did.

00:39:34,377 --> 00:39:36,984
(gasps, grunts)

00:39:39,322 --> 00:39:42,129
I stayed there.

00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,166
I watched him suffer.

00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:46,638
Then I watched the
company lie to you.

00:39:46,638 --> 00:39:48,108
Distance themselves.

00:39:48,108 --> 00:39:50,447
Cover up.

00:39:50,447 --> 00:39:52,952
Just like they did
allthose years ago.

00:39:52,952 --> 00:39:55,591
Which is why
you recorded Dr. Lanning.

00:39:55,591 --> 00:39:58,297
You wanted to bring down
the whole company,

00:39:58,297 --> 00:40:01,571
so they couldn't toy
with any more viruses,

00:40:01,571 --> 00:40:04,211
breed any more monsters.

00:40:04,211 --> 00:40:06,248
I...

00:40:06,248 --> 00:40:08,387
would be the last.

00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:35,513
Sara?

00:40:37,618 --> 00:40:38,988
Are you...?
I'm fine.

00:40:38,988 --> 00:40:40,691
Dr. Emmett said that
I could tell you the news.

00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:42,027
No sign of infection,

00:40:42,027 --> 00:40:44,065
and tests are showing
that the virus dies

00:40:44,065 --> 00:40:46,236
within two hours
of exposure to air.

00:40:50,012 --> 00:40:53,119
Weaver's house wouldn't have
been infectious when we entered.

00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,154
No.

00:40:54,154 --> 00:40:55,391
CDC's gonna keep
an area watch,

00:40:55,391 --> 00:40:57,261
but there haven't been
any other infections.

00:40:57,261 --> 00:40:58,430
We're clear.

00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,100
(sighs)

00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,637
We're free to go.

00:41:01,637 --> 00:41:03,642
(gasps in disbelief)

00:41:08,085 --> 00:41:10,190
(sighs)

00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,161
What are we waiting for?

00:41:14,533 --> 00:41:15,568
I'm starving.

00:41:15,568 --> 00:41:17,372
Me, too.
Breakfast?

00:41:17,372 --> 00:41:18,675
Coffee.

00:41:18,675 --> 00:41:20,412
Yeah.

00:41:20,412 --> 00:41:22,049
Yeah.

00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:30,368
Hey, Dave.

00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,470
I spoke with your doctor.

00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,606
You're both okay.

00:41:34,543 --> 00:41:36,543
Uh, we were about
to grab a bite to eat.

00:41:36,543 --> 00:41:37,811
Want to join us?

00:41:37,811 --> 00:41:39,145
I'd love to...

00:41:39,145 --> 00:41:41,982
but I'm actually here for work.

00:41:41,982 --> 00:41:43,083
Shawn Steubens,

00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,118
the kid who got
infected...

00:41:45,118 --> 00:41:46,253
He didn't make it.

00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,854
PHILLIPS:
He wasn't so lucky.

00:41:47,854 --> 00:41:49,856
It goes without saying...

00:41:49,856 --> 00:41:53,026
but I'm just really glad
you're both okay.

00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,569
Goes without saying.

00:42:02,569 --> 00:42:03,703
Yeah.
