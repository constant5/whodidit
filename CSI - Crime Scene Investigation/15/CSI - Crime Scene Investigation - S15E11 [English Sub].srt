00:00:04,977 --> 00:00:06,981
(siren wails, stops)

00:00:06,981 --> 00:00:08,986
(indistinct radio communication)

00:00:08,986 --> 00:00:10,722
(car doors close)

00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,035
Oh, man.

00:00:17,035 --> 00:00:18,672
What do you got there,
Super Dave?

00:00:18,672 --> 00:00:20,209
First blush?

00:00:20,209 --> 00:00:22,680
Well, judging from the major
crushing injuries

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,217
to his chest
and torso,

00:00:24,217 --> 00:00:25,519
I'd say a hit and run.

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,789
More like
hit and drag.

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:29,060
Guy left a trail.

00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,233
Mmm, that's one hell of a roll,
I'll tell you that.

00:00:34,137 --> 00:00:36,108
You see something?

00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:37,110
No skid marks.

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,279
He skidded plenty,

00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:40,116
but there's
no tire marks.

00:00:40,116 --> 00:00:41,687
So whatever hit him
didn't slow down at all.

00:00:41,687 --> 00:00:44,124
Plus, the angle's
all wrong.

00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:44,693
Look at it.

00:00:44,693 --> 00:00:46,396
Car would have to be headed
off the road

00:00:46,396 --> 00:00:48,233
to send him flying
in that direction.

00:00:49,502 --> 00:00:52,508
All right, how about body dump?

00:00:52,508 --> 00:00:54,179
Tossed out, high speed.

00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,216
Come here and check out
this glass.

00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:02,228
Look at the thickness.

00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,233
That's at least
five-eighths of an inch.

00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:06,104
Definitely didn't come
from a car.

00:01:06,104 --> 00:01:07,640
More like a window;
it's heavy duty.

00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:11,080
PHILLIPS:
Guys.

00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,318
Wherever that glass
came from,

00:01:13,318 --> 00:01:15,055
we got plenty of it
on the victim.

00:01:19,765 --> 00:01:22,070
STOKES: You guys don't think
we've got ourselves

00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,472
a jumper here,
do you?

00:01:23,472 --> 00:01:25,109
SANDERS:
Well, you do realize

00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:26,478
the problem with that theory--

00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:29,084
there's nowhere to jump
from on this block.

00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:33,092
So where did he come from?

00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,095
Did you get an I.D.?

00:01:39,305 --> 00:01:42,111
Bradley Weaks,
an accountant.

00:01:42,111 --> 00:01:47,121
Silver Spring Office Tower,
30th floor.

00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:48,124
Silver Springs...?!

00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,681
STOKES:
Well, you got to admit--

00:01:59,681 --> 00:02:01,451
that's one hell of a jump.

Looks like a tornado went
through this place.

00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:57,567
This looks like the same glass
we found with the victim.

00:02:57,567 --> 00:02:59,805
Radial pattern, so...

00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,675
came from
that direction.

00:03:01,675 --> 00:03:03,312
SANDERS:
Two blown-out windows.

00:03:03,312 --> 00:03:06,218
It's just like an entrance
and an exit wound.

00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:09,258
Something blasted in
from that window,

00:03:09,258 --> 00:03:10,661
cut the corner
of the room here,

00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:12,498
and then goes out that one.

00:03:12,498 --> 00:03:13,934
Yeah, but what the hell was it?

00:03:13,934 --> 00:03:15,237
I mean, this glass is thick.

00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,673
Normally, you could hit
these windows

00:03:16,673 --> 00:03:18,710
with a baseball bat,
they wouldn't even blink.

00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,951
Yeah, I think we're way
beyond a baseball bat here.

00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:22,953
Look at that.

00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,698
Scorch mark.

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,606
Do you think this thing
was rocket-powered?

00:03:32,606 --> 00:03:35,445
Like a rocket-propelled
grenade, maybe?

00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:37,617
Then why's the office
still in one piece?

00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,253
Didn't detonate?

00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:40,423
Maybe it was a dud.

00:03:40,423 --> 00:03:41,391
Or on a timer.

00:03:41,391 --> 00:03:43,429
Some of these are
triggered by a signal--

00:03:43,429 --> 00:03:44,965
maybe the signal
was never sent.

00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,443
Now, what if the guy
was standing here,

00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:53,717
<i>and this rocket-propelled</i>
<i>whatever hits him...</i>

00:03:55,787 --> 00:03:56,723
...carries him out the window,

00:03:56,723 --> 00:04:01,232
sends him 30 floors down
and 100 yards up the street.

00:04:01,232 --> 00:04:02,969
This guy was
an accountant.

00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:04,638
Somebody decides
to take him out,

00:04:04,638 --> 00:04:08,279
and they use a rocket-powered
something to do it.

00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:09,816
That don't make
any sense to me.

00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,453
Maybe we'll know more
when we find it.

00:04:11,453 --> 00:04:13,924
What goes up has
to go down, right?

00:04:13,924 --> 00:04:15,595
It's got to be
out there somewhere.

00:04:15,595 --> 00:04:18,034
Okay, so that's
puzzle number one.

00:04:18,034 --> 00:04:22,910
Puzzle number two is putting
this window back together.

00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:26,418
Maybe we can figure out
what came through it.

00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:26,985
Your pick.

00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:30,659
Needle in a haystack,

00:04:31,294 --> 00:04:33,298
or the impossible
jigsaw.

00:04:33,298 --> 00:04:34,567
Why don't you take
the easy one.

00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:35,970
Which one is that?

00:04:55,644 --> 00:04:58,050
♪ ♪

00:05:16,855 --> 00:05:17,957
What do you think?

00:05:17,957 --> 00:05:18,993
Well, it's not 100%,

00:05:18,993 --> 00:05:21,498
but it's enough
to see an impact zone.

00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:22,800
Yeah.

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,971
Bigger than any RPG
I've ever seen.

00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:25,873
Yeah.

00:05:27,977 --> 00:05:29,080
It's, uh...

00:05:29,514 --> 00:05:32,988
it's about 24
to 30 inches.

00:05:32,988 --> 00:05:36,496
Something that big
and rocket-powered?

00:05:36,496 --> 00:05:39,835
I mean, unless we're talking
about a damn cruise missile...

00:05:39,835 --> 00:05:41,706
What do you think
it could have been?

00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:43,610
Honestly,
I have no idea.

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,051
Hey, can I bounce
something off you?
Sure.

00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:49,388
So, I've been looking
into the death of our CPA,

00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:51,059
trying to figure out who
would want to take him out

00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,796
in such a
spectacular fashion.

00:05:52,796 --> 00:05:53,831
Did you come up
with something?

00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:54,566
I don't know, I mean,

00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:56,403
this guy is as average
as average gets.

00:05:56,403 --> 00:05:58,708
He's a mid-level CPA
at a mid-tier firm.

00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,080
But there is one
possible lead.

00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,084
The firm where the
victim worked--

00:06:03,084 --> 00:06:04,721
Baker, Smith, Capaldi.

00:06:04,721 --> 00:06:06,958
They, along with about 20
other firms across the country,

00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,631
have very tenuous ties
with the Colombian cartel.

00:06:09,631 --> 00:06:11,635
You're thinking this is
a cartel hit?

00:06:11,635 --> 00:06:12,603
I don't know what I'm thinking.

00:06:12,603 --> 00:06:15,476
I'm trying to draw a line
between a... a Vegas accountant

00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,981
and a possible RPG attack.

00:06:17,981 --> 00:06:20,520
So far, the cartel angle
is the only connection

00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,889
I've been able
to come up with.

00:06:26,532 --> 00:06:29,104
(indistinct page over P.A.)

00:06:29,104 --> 00:06:30,106
Hey.

00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:31,008
You having any luck?

00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:33,146
Actually, I am.

00:06:33,146 --> 00:06:36,820
I've isolated some of the trace
from our mysterious UFO.

00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,022
It's a UFO now?

00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:41,530
I'm only using the term
in the strictest literal sense:

00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,634
"Unidentified Flying Object."

00:06:43,634 --> 00:06:46,674
Although, admittedly,
I do find the notion

00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:48,812
that we are not alone in this
universe to be oddly comforting.

00:06:48,812 --> 00:06:50,582
Uh-huh.

00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:54,190
What did you find out about
whatever this rocket thing was?

00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,561
For starters,
it wasn't a rocket.

00:06:56,561 --> 00:06:58,899
Or at least not
rocket-powered.

00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:01,839
I found fuel residue
in the scorch marks.

00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,444
Jet-A aviation fuel.

00:07:04,444 --> 00:07:05,747
So it was jet-powered?

00:07:05,747 --> 00:07:09,454
Yes, the marks come
from close contact

00:07:09,454 --> 00:07:12,761
with the exhaust nozzle from a
jet engine rather than a rocket.

00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:15,600
Which implies an entirely
different type of flying object.

00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,435
Mm-hmm.

00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:19,909
More likely, it's something that
was piloted rather than fired.

00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:21,513
And there was
something else telling

00:07:21,513 --> 00:07:22,782
about these scorch marks.

00:07:22,782 --> 00:07:24,786
You expose wood
to intense heat,

00:07:24,786 --> 00:07:25,821
such as the case here,

00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,558
and you get
a spontaneous breakdown

00:07:27,558 --> 00:07:29,830
of the cellulose into charcoal.

00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:33,203
But what is charcoal?

00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,205
BOTH:
Carbon.

00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:35,942
Obviously.

00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:39,116
Carbon with some tarry residue
and a little bit of wood ash.

00:07:39,116 --> 00:07:41,554
The hotter the burn,
the faster the process happens.

00:07:41,554 --> 00:07:42,689
The faster it happens,

00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:45,061
the less wood ash you're gonna
have left in the mix.

00:07:45,061 --> 00:07:46,965
Yeah, so you measure
the amount of ash,

00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:49,236
you get a rough idea
of how hot it was burning.

00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:51,140
I can go one better.

00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,643
By measuring the wood ash

00:07:52,643 --> 00:07:54,581
over the length
of the burn,

00:07:54,581 --> 00:07:56,218
we can determine whether
our jet was throttling up

00:07:56,218 --> 00:07:58,790
or throttling down,
so to speak.

00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,262
And?

00:07:59,262 --> 00:08:03,867
Tip to tip, the intensity
of the burn drops 20%.

00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:06,104
Wait, so it was slowing down?
Rapidly.

00:08:06,104 --> 00:08:08,676
Based on the relative
fuel residue,

00:08:08,676 --> 00:08:11,649
I'd say it was running
out of gas.

00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:12,919
Which means it couldn't
have gone far.

00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:14,923
STOKES: <i>Depends on</i>
<i>your definition of far.</i>

00:08:14,923 --> 00:08:17,094
Even if this thing
was slowing down,

00:08:17,094 --> 00:08:19,098
it still had
significant velocity.

00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,835
Enough to crash
through two windows

00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:24,676
and take a 175-pound man
with it.

00:08:24,676 --> 00:08:26,848
Any way to calculate
where it landed?

00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:28,852
I've been playing
with some numbers,

00:08:28,852 --> 00:08:31,824
uh, based on the energy
necessary to break the glass,

00:08:31,824 --> 00:08:35,232
the momentum transferred to
the victim, gravity, elevation,

00:08:35,232 --> 00:08:37,870
but these are only
ballpark figures right now.

00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,875
Ballpark's better
than nothing.

00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,244
What are the numbers
telling you?

00:08:41,244 --> 00:08:42,948
Well, the numbers tell me
it could have traveled

00:08:42,948 --> 00:08:45,787
another quarter,
maybe half, mile...

00:08:45,787 --> 00:08:47,624
in this general arc...

00:08:47,624 --> 00:08:49,026
landed somewhere...

00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:50,897
in that area.

00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:54,137
Okay, I'll make the call.

00:08:54,137 --> 00:08:55,640
Get the uniforms
out there.

00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,241
All right, cool.

00:09:01,886 --> 00:09:03,824
FINLAY: <i>While unis were</i>
<i>canvassing the area,</i>

00:09:03,824 --> 00:09:05,160
<i>they said they found this.</i>

00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:10,304
(Stokes whistles)

00:09:11,306 --> 00:09:12,141
STOKES:
Kidding me?

00:09:12,141 --> 00:09:13,745
It looks like a war zone.

00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:24,299
FINLAY: Looks like we have
what's left of a body.

00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:26,303
Ugh.

00:09:26,303 --> 00:09:28,141
Cab driver must have been
sitting in here.

00:09:28,341 --> 00:09:30,746
Sleeping, maybe.

00:09:30,746 --> 00:09:31,915
That would be
a rude awakening.

00:09:31,915 --> 00:09:33,752
Right?
Pulverized.

00:09:33,752 --> 00:09:36,858
Hey! Hey! What the hell are
you doing to my cab?

00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:38,930
Look at it, what am I
supposed to do now?

00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,032
That's my livelihood.

00:09:40,032 --> 00:09:41,836
All right, sir, we're
from the Vegas crime lab.

00:09:41,836 --> 00:09:43,138
Was there a fare
in your taxi?

00:09:43,138 --> 00:09:44,608
Somebody waiting,
anything like that?

00:09:44,608 --> 00:09:45,744
No, what are
you talking about?

00:09:45,744 --> 00:09:48,149
I've been off duty
for 12 hours, I just woke up.

00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:49,719
Nobody was in my cab.

00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:50,787
All right, all right.

00:09:51,723 --> 00:09:53,193
I'll tell you what,
this officer's gonna

00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,361
take your statement, okay?

00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:57,702
This is not how I needed
to start my day.

00:09:59,973 --> 00:10:00,775
Hey...

00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,049
if that's the cab driver, then
who got blown to bits in here?

00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:06,353
That's a good question.

00:10:15,372 --> 00:10:18,311
STOKES: This might be part
of our missile.

00:10:18,311 --> 00:10:19,714
Engine, maybe.

00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,894
This might be
the nose cone.

00:10:25,894 --> 00:10:28,666
Ugh, Nick.

00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:29,868
It's part of a helmet.

00:10:30,002 --> 00:10:30,970
Look at this...

00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:35,246
(grunts)

00:10:35,246 --> 00:10:36,315
Is that a boot?

00:10:36,315 --> 00:10:36,983
Yeah.

00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:39,154
Somebody's foot's still in it.

00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:48,440
Whoever it was
wasn't sitting in here.

00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,979
I think they flew in here.

00:10:50,979 --> 00:10:52,682
Our missile was a man?

00:10:57,826 --> 00:10:59,162
(man whoops)

00:11:01,734 --> 00:11:03,071
Oh! Sheesh...

00:11:04,173 --> 00:11:06,010
It's called a wingsuit.

00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,881
Or-or a squirrel suit.
Same difference.

00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:09,216
(man whooping)

00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:11,855
RUSSELL: And this is what
our guy was doing?

00:11:11,855 --> 00:11:13,692
That's a hell of a lot
of kinetic energy.

00:11:13,692 --> 00:11:14,995
How fast we going there,
do you think?

00:11:14,995 --> 00:11:17,100
Oh, around
220 miles an hour,

00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,271
depending on good design
and proper fit.

00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:21,910
It turns falling
into flying, basically.

00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,713
But that wasn't good enough
for our guy.

00:11:23,713 --> 00:11:25,016
He puts the suit on,

00:11:25,016 --> 00:11:26,385
figures it's not
dangerous enough,

00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:28,823
so he straps jet engines
to his feet?

00:11:28,823 --> 00:11:30,827
He was begging for trouble.

00:11:30,827 --> 00:11:31,362
Well, I don't think he'd argue

00:11:31,362 --> 00:11:32,464
with that now.

00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,872
So, anyway, Morgan's been
working with David,

00:11:35,872 --> 00:11:38,043
trying to separate the
man from the machine.

00:11:38,043 --> 00:11:39,345
Literally.

00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:40,949
So I'm gonna go in there
and check on her.

00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:42,819
She should be back by now.

00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:43,283
Okay.

00:11:47,862 --> 00:11:48,764
STOKES:
Hey.

00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:51,303
How's it going in here?

00:11:51,303 --> 00:11:52,740
It's going.

00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,443
You know, one of my exes
was a skydiver.

00:11:54,443 --> 00:11:55,446
He had a wingsuit.

00:11:55,446 --> 00:11:57,350
I don't remember it
being this high-tech.

00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,222
If anything, it struck me
as more of a clown suit.

00:12:00,222 --> 00:12:02,159
Course, I could've said that
about everything he wore.

00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,863
Well, that's probably why
he's your ex-boyfriend.

00:12:03,863 --> 00:12:05,900
(wry chuckle)
Now, this suit--

00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,305
it, uh, it looks different than
the one I was just watching.

00:12:08,305 --> 00:12:09,508
It's more advanced.

00:12:09,508 --> 00:12:12,280
Looks like some sort
of metal exoskeleton

00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,349
across the wings.

00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:15,120
I haven't seen that before.

00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,856
And this...

00:12:16,856 --> 00:12:20,831
is what's left of the
propulsion system.

00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:22,501
BRODY: It's definitely not
something that was

00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:24,271
hacked together
in somebody's garage.

00:12:24,271 --> 00:12:25,306
This is sophisticated.

00:12:25,306 --> 00:12:27,210
So where in the hell do you
think this thing came from?

00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,213
I don't know.

00:12:28,213 --> 00:12:29,215
But check this out.

00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,384
It's got one more thing

00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:32,455
my ex didn't have
when he was diving.

00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:35,996
There's a little box

00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:37,566
integrated into the
front of the rigging.

00:12:37,566 --> 00:12:38,902
And it looks like
it has leads

00:12:38,902 --> 00:12:40,539
connected to the suit,
as well.

00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:42,041
Looks like a
mini version

00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,146
of a black box,
like they have on airplanes.

00:12:44,146 --> 00:12:45,849
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:46,919
It's weird, right?

00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,221
ANDREWS:
Hey.

00:12:48,321 --> 00:12:51,360
I got an I.D. on your,
uh, Rocket Man.

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,362
Ran his DNA.

00:12:52,362 --> 00:12:53,799
When he didn't
pop in CODIS,

00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:56,338
I expanded the search
to military databases.

00:12:56,338 --> 00:12:57,340
Military?

00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,542
In this case,
Air Force.

00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:00,813
Your deceased
was a pilot:

00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,117
Captain Robert Holland.

00:13:02,117 --> 00:13:04,154
He was stationed
at Nellis.

00:13:04,154 --> 00:13:05,991
So has Russell
notified the family yet?

00:13:05,991 --> 00:13:07,828
The wife.
She lives on base.

00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,231
The victim's C.O.
is bringing her in.

00:13:09,231 --> 00:13:10,501
All right.

00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:13,573
Mrs. Holland, I am
so sorry for your loss.

00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:16,579
Thank you.

00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:17,849
Major Mills,

00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:19,418
on the phone last night,
you said that

00:13:19,418 --> 00:13:21,857
Captain Holland was not
on duty last night.

00:13:21,857 --> 00:13:23,861
Yes. That's correct.

00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:24,897
And the wingsuit--

00:13:24,897 --> 00:13:26,834
that's property
of the Air Force?

00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:29,573
Uh, no-- technically,
it belongs to TRP Aeronautics,

00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:31,510
a DoD contractor.

00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,481
The Air Force is
exploring the possibility

00:13:33,481 --> 00:13:35,586
of using them in
urban incursion.

00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,525
And Captain Holland was
on loan to TRP

00:13:38,525 --> 00:13:39,594
as a test pilot.

00:13:39,594 --> 00:13:40,596
If he wasn't on duty

00:13:40,596 --> 00:13:42,900
last night, then...

00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,072
what was he doing in his suit,

00:13:45,072 --> 00:13:46,909
flying in downtown Vegas?

00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,312
(sighs)

00:13:48,312 --> 00:13:50,049
That's a damn good question.

00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:52,253
All I can tell you
is that test pilots--

00:13:52,253 --> 00:13:54,190
like Captain Holland--

00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,596
live to fly.

00:13:56,596 --> 00:13:58,099
It wouldn't be the first time
one of them

00:13:58,099 --> 00:14:00,370
stole a prototype
to log a few extra hours.

00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,105
No.

00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:02,107
Bobby wasn't like that.

00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,044
He-he never took
unnecessary risks.

00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,313
He wasn't that
kind of pilot.

00:14:05,313 --> 00:14:06,450
Amanda, you have
to understand--

00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,152
Bobby didn't want you to worry.

00:14:08,152 --> 00:14:09,956
Now, I'm sure
he downplayed the risks

00:14:09,956 --> 00:14:11,093
of whatever
he was involved in,

00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:12,328
authorized or no.

00:14:12,328 --> 00:14:14,132
And that's not
a criticism.

00:14:14,132 --> 00:14:16,670
Taking risks is what made
Bobby a great pilot.

00:14:18,407 --> 00:14:19,543
RUSSELL:
Mrs. Holland...

00:14:20,144 --> 00:14:20,646
when was the last time

00:14:20,646 --> 00:14:23,183
you saw your husband?

00:14:23,183 --> 00:14:23,649
Truthfully,

00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:25,021
it's been about three days.

00:14:25,021 --> 00:14:26,190
Three days ago?

00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,028
Ever since he started
working for TRP,

00:14:28,028 --> 00:14:30,332
it's not uncommon for him
to be gone for days at a time.

00:14:30,332 --> 00:14:32,269
MILLS:
Mr. Russell, I understand

00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:35,242
that this accident resulted
in the death of a civilian.

00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:36,979
Now, for the record,
the blame here

00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:39,318
lies entirely
with TRP Aeronautics.

00:14:39,318 --> 00:14:40,987
They never
should've allowed

00:14:40,987 --> 00:14:42,390
the unauthorized removal

00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,161
of that prototype
from their facility.

00:14:44,161 --> 00:14:47,233
Major, you keep saying that
like Bobby did something wrong.

00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:49,237
(sighs)

00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:51,175
Mr. Russell, if you don't mind,

00:14:51,175 --> 00:14:53,547
Captain Holland's parents
have yet to be notified.

00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:56,987
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:14:56,987 --> 00:14:58,390
I, um... I forgot my phone.

00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,995
I'll bring
the car around.

00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:04,369
Mr. Russell...

00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,674
I don't care what anybody says.

00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:07,676
I know my husband.

00:15:07,676 --> 00:15:09,980
And he wasn't some
yeehaw test pilot.

00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,517
He never would've flown
without authorization.

00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:13,388
Think the Air Force
is covering something up?

00:15:13,388 --> 00:15:14,724
I think they're
trying to blame Bobby.

00:15:14,724 --> 00:15:16,460
That way, they can avoid
paying death benefits,

00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,663
they can take away
his pension...

00:15:17,663 --> 00:15:19,133
I mean, it's all about money.

00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:21,203
They don't even care
that they dirty his name.

00:15:21,203 --> 00:15:23,175
Well, if there's something
to find, Mrs. Holland,

00:15:23,175 --> 00:15:25,746
I promise you, we'll find it.

00:15:25,746 --> 00:15:26,515
Okay.

00:15:27,483 --> 00:15:28,152
Thank you.

00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:32,093
SANDERS:
<i>I've been examining</i>
<i>the wingsuit,</i>

00:15:32,093 --> 00:15:34,765
and our flyer's rig
has two chutes.

00:15:34,765 --> 00:15:36,168
A primary...

00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:37,036
and a reserve.

00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,175
Now, neither one
of them deployed.

00:15:39,175 --> 00:15:40,343
Why?
I don't know,

00:15:40,343 --> 00:15:41,646
but you gotta figure
the guy was either dead

00:15:41,646 --> 00:15:43,650
or unconscious when he
hit that office tower.

00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,353
Wouldn't have
pulled the ripcord.

00:15:45,353 --> 00:15:46,990
But the reserve

00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,398
has an AAD-- an automatic
activation device,

00:15:50,398 --> 00:15:52,702
which should have
deployed on its own.

00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:53,671
No matter what.

00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:57,479
So was the AAD
damaged by the impact?

00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:03,290
Well, no sign of
external damage.

00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,596
Okay, the trigger's based
on air pressure, right?

00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:06,431
Needs two things to pop.

00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:08,735
You gotta to be really
close to the ground,

00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:11,374
and you gotta be falling...
really fast.

00:16:11,374 --> 00:16:12,710
Which would scare me
into popping.

00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,413
Okay, so...

00:16:14,413 --> 00:16:15,617
let's scare it.

00:16:15,617 --> 00:16:17,487
See what happens.

00:16:17,487 --> 00:16:18,188
Okay.

00:16:19,324 --> 00:16:21,729
All we've got to do
is trick this bad boy

00:16:21,729 --> 00:16:24,067
into thinking it's
taking a fall, yeah?

00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,436
We suck the air out,

00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:27,140
lower the air
pressure inside,

00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,077
the chute thinks
it's at altitude.

00:16:29,077 --> 00:16:31,148
Couple thousand feet ought
to do it, don't you think?

00:16:31,148 --> 00:16:32,618
(air hissing)

00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:41,136
All we need now
is the fall.

00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:45,612
Geronimo!

00:16:46,212 --> 00:16:47,649
(air hissing)

00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:50,455
SANDERS: Altimeter's showing
a rapid descent...

00:16:50,722 --> 00:16:52,159
(beeps)
...altitude's dropping,

00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:53,728
all the way to zero.

00:16:57,235 --> 00:16:58,237
It should've fired.

00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:00,810
Excuse me.

00:17:09,427 --> 00:17:11,264
Standard
barometric sensor.

00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:12,768
Hold on-- Nick,

00:17:12,768 --> 00:17:13,803
check this out.

00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:18,580
STOKES: That's obviously
been tampered with.

00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,584
Tool marks.
Two-pronged pattern.

00:17:20,584 --> 00:17:22,154
The circuit's been cut.

00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:26,162
Well, let's see what happens
if I bridge the circuit.

00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:32,141
All right, you ready?
Yeah.

00:17:38,154 --> 00:17:41,293
And that's what turns
an accident into murder.

00:17:46,738 --> 00:17:47,740
I'm so sorry, Ms. Mason.

00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,577
These officers want to
have a word with you.

00:17:49,577 --> 00:17:51,881
It's all right, Ellen.

00:17:52,783 --> 00:17:55,589
Obviously, they have news
about Captain Holland.

00:17:55,589 --> 00:17:56,591
Is that right, officers?

00:17:56,591 --> 00:17:57,794
What makes
you say that?

00:17:57,794 --> 00:17:59,898
(clears throat)

00:17:59,898 --> 00:18:01,469
Thank you.

00:18:02,504 --> 00:18:05,443
Well, last night,
Captain Holland stole

00:18:05,443 --> 00:18:07,614
a wingsuit prototype
from this facility,

00:18:07,614 --> 00:18:10,253
a very expensive prototype,
and we have not seen him since.

00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:11,188
So, either he caught

00:18:11,188 --> 00:18:12,290
the largest thermal
in history,

00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,527
or he's gotten
himself into trouble.

00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:15,364
You're here, so,
I'm guessing it's the latter?

00:18:15,364 --> 00:18:16,633
STOKES: Your guess
would be right.

00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:17,668
The captain crashed the suit.

00:18:17,668 --> 00:18:20,474
Killed a civilian
and himself.

00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:24,616
That means you have questions.

00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:26,486
Uh, okay. I expect
you'll want to start

00:18:26,486 --> 00:18:28,525
with our Project Icarus lab.

00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:29,292
Icarus?

00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:31,731
Icarus. Greek myth.
Wax wings,

00:18:31,731 --> 00:18:32,800
flew too close
to the sun.

00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,238
That's a bit of an
inauspicious name

00:18:35,238 --> 00:18:36,574
for a wingsuit
project,

00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,813
given the way things turned
out for poor old Icarus,

00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:40,750
don't you think?
MASON:
I'm sorry, I didn't
catch your name.

00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,319
CSI Nick Stokes.

00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:44,624
Well, CSI Nick Stokes...

00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,860
follow me.

00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:47,831
Okay...

00:18:50,436 --> 00:18:52,473
(tools and machines
whirring and buzzing quietly)

00:18:52,473 --> 00:19:00,290
(low, indistinct conversations)

00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,759
MASON:
Captain, this is

00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,498
CSI Nick Stokes. And...

00:19:04,498 --> 00:19:06,302
Detective Crawford.

00:19:06,302 --> 00:19:07,538
Captain Ferris.

00:19:07,538 --> 00:19:08,506
Is this about Holland?

00:19:09,342 --> 00:19:12,682
Lance... Holland is dead.

00:19:12,682 --> 00:19:13,784
What?

00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,891
God, what happened?

00:19:17,392 --> 00:19:18,861
He had an accident.
Not in the suit.

00:19:18,861 --> 00:19:20,531
Yeah, it was in the suit.

00:19:20,531 --> 00:19:22,502
Where is it?
CRAWFORD:
It's evidence.

00:19:22,502 --> 00:19:24,373
No, I-I don't...
I don't think you understand.

00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:25,743
We're at a critical
stage in testing.

00:19:25,743 --> 00:19:28,382
I need to see that suit
to determine what went wrong.

00:19:28,382 --> 00:19:30,319
We're the ones
examining it now, okay?

00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,460
You do have some interesting

00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,729
tools here, Captain.

00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:37,266
Like that one in your hand.

00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:38,568
What is that
used for?

00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,306
It's specially made,

00:19:40,306 --> 00:19:41,609
used to adjust
the attack angle

00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:42,276
on the wing.

00:19:42,911 --> 00:19:43,913
Specially made?

00:19:43,913 --> 00:19:44,915
By me.

00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:46,786
My design.

00:19:48,523 --> 00:19:51,262
Mind if I take it
back to the crime lab?

00:19:51,262 --> 00:19:51,730
Why?

00:19:52,497 --> 00:19:54,268
Well, we can talk
about that downtown.

00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,279
Wait... am I under arrest?

00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:01,783
Captain Ferris,
just go with the officers.

00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,754
I mean, we have
nothing to hide, right?

00:20:05,993 --> 00:20:06,761
CRAWFORD:
Please.

00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:10,869
Thank you.

00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:16,914
STOKES:
<i>Here's the deal:</i>

00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:19,754
someone used a tool
just like yours

00:20:19,754 --> 00:20:20,923
to sabotage the AAD

00:20:20,923 --> 00:20:22,493
on Holland's
reserve parachute.

00:20:22,493 --> 00:20:24,030
Bobby was like a brother to me.

00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,000
CRAWFORD: Yeah, we imagine
there's a lot of camaraderie

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,437
between test pilots.

00:20:27,437 --> 00:20:29,674
Lot of competition, too, right?

00:20:29,674 --> 00:20:31,946
Yeah. Not so that I would
do something to him.

00:20:31,946 --> 00:20:33,315
STOKES: Okay, come on,
man, we're just

00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,684
trying to get
some answers, here.

00:20:34,684 --> 00:20:36,923
Poor guy's widow deserves
that much, don't you think?

00:20:36,923 --> 00:20:38,527
God.

00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,562
Amanda...

00:20:39,562 --> 00:20:40,731
Yeah, Amanda.

00:20:40,731 --> 00:20:42,935
And right now,
she thinks the Air Force

00:20:42,935 --> 00:20:44,639
is going to hold back
her husband's benefits

00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:45,741
for stealing that suit.

00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:46,876
Look...

00:20:46,876 --> 00:20:48,780
Bobby didn't
steal the suit.

00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,019
Well, your C.O.
sure seems to think he did.

00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:54,493
As does Ms. Mason,
the CEO of TRP.

00:20:54,493 --> 00:20:55,728
No, that... that's bull.

00:20:55,728 --> 00:20:57,732
From the Air Force
perspective, maybe

00:20:57,732 --> 00:20:59,035
the flight was
unauthorized,

00:20:59,035 --> 00:21:03,879
but not TRP.
God...! (groans)

00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:05,582
Can I get something
for my headache?

00:21:05,582 --> 00:21:07,587
In a minute--
keep talking about TRP.

00:21:07,587 --> 00:21:08,789
Are you saying
that they knew

00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:11,895
Captain Holland was
testing the suit on his own?

00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,067
It's Claudia, she's got us
pushing the limits.

00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:15,903
Logging extra hours
in the simulator,

00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,941
in the hypobaric chamber.

00:21:17,941 --> 00:21:19,812
Was she encouraging
after-hours flights?

00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:20,647
More than encourage,

00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:23,051
she, uh, she
paid incentives.

00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:25,690
Cash awards for
hitting milestones.

00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:29,365
Last month, Bobby,
he made, um, 25 grand

00:21:29,365 --> 00:21:31,369
for sustained level flight.

00:21:33,707 --> 00:21:35,845
You all right there,
Captain Ferris?

00:21:42,425 --> 00:21:43,827
Hey.

00:21:43,827 --> 00:21:44,763
Captain.

00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:45,498
Hey.

00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:50,474
Hey, man, do you know
where you are right now?

00:21:50,474 --> 00:21:51,778
H-Hey.

00:21:51,778 --> 00:21:52,947
Hey, guys.

00:21:52,947 --> 00:21:54,584
Hey.

00:21:54,584 --> 00:21:56,086
H-Hey, you guys
remember that girl?

00:21:57,556 --> 00:21:59,026
Th-That one time?

00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,064
Man, what was her name?

00:22:01,064 --> 00:22:02,734
Hmm?

00:22:02,734 --> 00:22:03,736
Captain?

00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:05,038
Captain.

00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:06,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,577
Call rescue.

00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:09,046
We need paramedics in here!

00:22:09,046 --> 00:22:11,050
Captain?

00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,689
I got you, I got you.

00:22:13,689 --> 00:22:14,625
What the hell is happening?

00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,963
I don't know,
I don't know.

00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:22,107
Captain?

00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,553
Crawford, he's dead.

00:22:34,566 --> 00:22:36,704
FINLAY: <i>Heard you were working</i>
<i>on Captain Ferris.</i>

00:22:36,704 --> 00:22:38,073
What have you got, Doc?

00:22:38,073 --> 00:22:39,209
Textbook.

00:22:39,209 --> 00:22:40,812
I could've told you
cerebral edema

00:22:40,812 --> 00:22:42,149
without even looking
at the body.

00:22:43,584 --> 00:22:45,588
Brain tissue's like
any other part of the body,

00:22:45,588 --> 00:22:48,061
it swells in response
to injury or illness.

00:22:48,061 --> 00:22:49,496
Yeah, but unlike the
rest of the body,

00:22:49,496 --> 00:22:50,833
the brain has
nowhere to go.

00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:52,637
True, it swells
against the skull,

00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,874
causing neurovascular
constriction.

00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,878
Cutting off the brain's
oxygen supply.

00:22:56,878 --> 00:22:58,515
So if that's C.O.D.,

00:22:58,515 --> 00:22:59,551
what caused the edema?

00:22:59,551 --> 00:23:00,954
The list of possibilities
is long.

00:23:00,954 --> 00:23:04,127
The fact that Captain Ferris was
a pilot suggested to me

00:23:04,127 --> 00:23:05,731
we could be dealing with HACE.

00:23:05,731 --> 00:23:06,899
HACE?

00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:08,035
It's an acronym--

00:23:08,035 --> 00:23:10,039
High-Altitude Cerebral Edema.

00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:12,678
It's a form of altitude
sickness caused

00:23:12,678 --> 00:23:14,682
by repeated
rapid ascents.

00:23:14,682 --> 00:23:16,854
It's not the first time
I've seen it, either.

00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:17,303
What do you mean?

00:23:17,303 --> 00:23:18,724
Well, as I'm sure
you remember,

00:23:18,724 --> 00:23:21,028
there was not a lot of
Captain Holland left to examine,

00:23:21,028 --> 00:23:24,870
but his brain tissue did
present vasogenic edema,

00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:28,177
capillary leakage and spongiosis
of the white matter,

00:23:28,177 --> 00:23:30,481
and those are all
consistent with HACE.

00:23:30,481 --> 00:23:30,983
Do you think it's possible

00:23:30,983 --> 00:23:32,987
that Holland could have
stroked out mid-flight,

00:23:32,987 --> 00:23:35,959
the same way that Ferris
stroked out mid-sentence?

00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:38,097
It's possible-- if he was
dropped off a plane

00:23:38,097 --> 00:23:39,534
at altitude in a wingsuit,

00:23:39,534 --> 00:23:42,273
that could certainly cause
the onset of HACE.

00:23:42,273 --> 00:23:44,912
A hypobaric chamber
replicates the condition

00:23:44,912 --> 00:23:46,014
of high altitude, right?

00:23:46,014 --> 00:23:47,984
Right, the Air Force
uses them for training.

00:23:47,984 --> 00:23:51,559
According to Nick,
TRP uses them, as well.

00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:53,896
They want to make sure that
their pilots can function,

00:23:53,896 --> 00:23:55,567
even with altitude sickness.

00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:56,836
Training like
that's dangerous--

00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:59,007
the margin of error
is incredibly small.

00:23:59,007 --> 00:24:00,945
And if you get even
a little bit aggressive,

00:24:00,945 --> 00:24:02,849
the effects could be lethal.

00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:10,030
MASON: People, no,
this work is unacceptable.

00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,099
We're not building
these suits

00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:13,103
for some jackass buzzing
a half-time show, okay?

00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:15,274
These are weapons of war.

00:24:15,274 --> 00:24:17,245
You know what, stop.
Everybody!

00:24:17,245 --> 00:24:17,687
Hey!

00:24:17,687 --> 00:24:18,781
Eyes on me. Listen.

00:24:18,781 --> 00:24:20,150
I know that
there have been

00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,854
a lot of distractions
lately, okay?

00:24:21,854 --> 00:24:24,961
But that is no excuse
for failure.

00:24:24,961 --> 00:24:25,963
Is that clear?

00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,905
Clear enough for me.

00:24:29,905 --> 00:24:31,909
CSI Stokes.

00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:33,646
Nice seeing you again.

00:24:33,646 --> 00:24:35,115
I assume you heard
about Captain Ferris.

00:24:35,115 --> 00:24:37,120
Two tragedies
in as many days.

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,822
It's almost more
than one can bear.

00:24:38,822 --> 00:24:41,628
Almost.

00:24:41,628 --> 00:24:42,664
Not sure what you mean.

00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:44,902
Maybe this will
make it clear.

00:24:45,971 --> 00:24:47,273
That's a search warrant.

00:24:49,745 --> 00:24:51,081
That allows us to seize

00:24:51,081 --> 00:24:53,820
medical records, program
schedules, flight data,

00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,357
all materials related
to Project Icarus.

00:24:55,357 --> 00:24:56,894
I-I don't,
I don't understand.

00:24:56,894 --> 00:24:58,831
I've been absolutely
nothing but cooperative.

00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,035
Two of your pilots
have died.

00:25:01,035 --> 00:25:03,039
Both victims of HACE.

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,108
Unfortunate accidents.

00:25:04,108 --> 00:25:05,979
Is that really what
you want to go with?

00:25:05,979 --> 00:25:08,084
'Cause on top
of the HACE,

00:25:08,084 --> 00:25:10,221
Captain Holland's parachute
was tampered with--

00:25:10,221 --> 00:25:12,693
either by the competition
or by you.

00:25:12,693 --> 00:25:16,166
So, quite frankly, I think
you're hiding something from me.

00:25:19,172 --> 00:25:20,743
This warrant is worthless

00:25:20,743 --> 00:25:22,747
without being cosigned
by a military judge.

00:25:22,747 --> 00:25:25,085
I don't need JAG approval,
and you know it.

00:25:27,123 --> 00:25:28,793
Okay, boys.

00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:29,762
MAN: Yes, sir.
Move out.

00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:33,369
You really want
to cooperate with me,

00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:35,740
give me the decryption key

00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:39,114
for the code from the black box
on Holland's wingsuit.

00:25:39,114 --> 00:25:40,751
I don't have it.

00:25:40,751 --> 00:25:42,722
Black boxes are
Air Force property,

00:25:42,722 --> 00:25:45,126
and if you want access, you're
gonna have to talk to them.

00:25:49,335 --> 00:25:51,373
You know what that is,
right, Major?

00:25:51,373 --> 00:25:52,742
Yes, I do.

00:25:52,742 --> 00:25:55,314
We need the encrypted data
from Captain Holland's flight

00:25:55,314 --> 00:25:56,416
the night he died.

00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:59,422
According to TRP,
as his C.O.,

00:25:59,422 --> 00:26:01,961
you're the only person
who can give it to us.

00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:03,298
That's correct.

00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:04,967
And?

00:26:04,967 --> 00:26:07,673
I'm sorry, but I can't give
you the decryption code.

00:26:07,673 --> 00:26:09,076
It's classified and...

00:26:09,076 --> 00:26:11,047
Two of your pilots
are dead.

00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:13,853
They died working
for a contractor

00:26:13,853 --> 00:26:16,992
who subjected them
to unnecessary risks.

00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,264
Might have even killed
one of them to cover it up.

00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,835
Those are serious
charges, Mr. Russell.

00:26:21,835 --> 00:26:24,842
These are your guys we're
talking about here, Major.

00:26:24,842 --> 00:26:28,015
TRP did something illegal,
and right now, they're just,

00:26:28,015 --> 00:26:30,019
they're hiding
behind the Air Force,

00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:31,255
they're hiding behind you.

00:26:31,255 --> 00:26:33,693
My hands are tied.

00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:36,266
Only if you let them be.

00:26:36,266 --> 00:26:39,907
Look, this kid,
Captain Holland,

00:26:39,907 --> 00:26:41,276
was under your command.

00:26:41,276 --> 00:26:42,813
He woke up every morning,

00:26:42,813 --> 00:26:46,821
and he put his life at risk
simply because you asked him to.

00:26:47,923 --> 00:26:50,428
Help me find
some peace for his wife.

00:26:51,764 --> 00:26:53,467
You need to do
the right thing here.

00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:00,281
There's an alphanumeric pass
phrase keyed into each box.

00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:03,755
I'll have my office send it
over to you within the hour.

00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:07,096
Thank you, Major.

00:27:07,096 --> 00:27:10,169
Like you said, it's
the right thing to do.

00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:20,958
How goes the data retrieval
on the wingsuit man?

00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:24,265
Honestly, I am crashing
and burning, just like him.

00:27:24,265 --> 00:27:25,801
What do you mean?

00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:27,104
The numbers don't
make sense.

00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,409
I think maybe
the data's corrupted.

00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:31,813
I mean, this thing was
involved in a serious crash.

00:27:31,813 --> 00:27:34,119
Black boxes are designed
to withstand crashes.

00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,755
That's the whole point.

00:27:35,755 --> 00:27:37,091
Take a look for yourself.

00:27:37,091 --> 00:27:39,362
At the biometric data.

00:27:40,532 --> 00:27:42,068
We thought Captain Holland
stroked out mid-flight,

00:27:42,068 --> 00:27:43,972
but look at his vitals.

00:27:43,972 --> 00:27:45,943
Heart rate, BP,
respiratory rate--

00:27:45,943 --> 00:27:47,880
all flatlined,
the whole way.

00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,218
According to this, he was dead
before he even took flight.

00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:51,354
That can't be possible.

00:27:53,325 --> 00:27:54,828
You know that
Sherlock Holmes quote--

00:27:54,828 --> 00:27:55,830
"Eliminate all other factors,

00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,500
the one which remains
must be the truth."

00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,938
"Must be the truth."

00:27:59,938 --> 00:28:02,077
So we're saying what?

00:28:02,077 --> 00:28:05,416
We're looking at an elaborate
body dump from a plane?

00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:07,487
Not according to this.

00:28:07,487 --> 00:28:10,961
Check out the altimeter reading
at the start of the flight.

00:28:10,961 --> 00:28:12,932
2,920 feet.

00:28:12,932 --> 00:28:13,400
Yeah.

00:28:14,101 --> 00:28:15,437
Now, given that
Las Vegas is

00:28:15,437 --> 00:28:17,808
roughly 2,200 feet
above sea level...

00:28:17,808 --> 00:28:20,982
That would mean he would jump
from a height of 700 feet.

00:28:20,982 --> 00:28:22,986
He didn't jump
from a plane.

00:28:22,986 --> 00:28:24,455
This is more
like a BASE jump.

00:28:24,455 --> 00:28:27,462
Okay, well,
the flight data would give us

00:28:27,462 --> 00:28:28,831
all the GPS coordinates, right?

00:28:28,831 --> 00:28:29,299
Right.

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,971
We know where he landed,

00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:34,510
now we just got to figure out
where he came from.

00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:39,319
I've reconstructed
Captain Holland's flight path

00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,556
on the night he died,

00:28:40,556 --> 00:28:42,593
zeroing in
on the point-of-origin

00:28:42,593 --> 00:28:44,964
of what we now know was
a BASE jump.

00:28:44,964 --> 00:28:47,103
Beginning here.

00:28:48,405 --> 00:28:50,142
The Delmore Towers.

00:28:50,142 --> 00:28:53,148
SANDERS: The top-floor
corporate condo, to be precise.

00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,921
Owned by TRP Aeronautics.

00:28:55,921 --> 00:28:58,526
Right, it says here:
TRP's CEO,

00:28:58,526 --> 00:29:01,933
Claudia Mason,
used it as her in-town digs.

00:29:01,933 --> 00:29:03,403
But she wasn't
the only one using it.

00:29:03,403 --> 00:29:06,442
The data on the black box shows
a history of BASE jumps

00:29:06,442 --> 00:29:09,381
at the same condo
over the last several months.

00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:12,388
So Holland was using
the Delmore Towers to train.

00:29:12,388 --> 00:29:14,526
Off base, off hours, off regs.

00:29:14,526 --> 00:29:17,900
And, we have to assume,
with Claudia's approval.

00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,071
You know, all these test pilots
vying for the bonuses

00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:22,442
that TRP was offering,

00:29:22,442 --> 00:29:25,181
maybe Claudia was just
trying to give Holland

00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:26,651
a leg up on the competition.

00:29:26,651 --> 00:29:29,557
Maybe that's not all
Claudia wanted to give him.

00:29:29,557 --> 00:29:30,926
Ah.

00:29:30,926 --> 00:29:32,296
Okay.

00:29:32,296 --> 00:29:33,498
All right,
I like that.

00:29:33,498 --> 00:29:37,439
So Holland goes up
to the tower with his wingsuit,

00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:39,110
a little off-hour training.

00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:43,119
But first he and Claudia decide
to have, uh, a pre-flight tryst.

00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:45,123
Things get hot and heavy.

00:29:45,123 --> 00:29:47,627
But Holland has HACE
just like Ferris.

00:29:47,627 --> 00:29:51,368
And in the heat of passion,
he just strokes out.

00:29:51,368 --> 00:29:52,370
Okay, so I'm Claudia.

00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,041
What do I do?

00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,009
Well, you have
two choices.

00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:56,980
You either call 911...

00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,116
Yeah, but if I do that,

00:29:58,116 --> 00:30:00,120
I lose my contracts,
I lose my company...

00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,058
So you go with
choice number two--

00:30:02,058 --> 00:30:03,293
You put Holland
in his wingsuit,

00:30:03,293 --> 00:30:05,497
you drag him out
onto the balcony,

00:30:05,497 --> 00:30:07,001
you fire up the jet engines

00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:10,241
to give him just enough
thrust to launch him,

00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,412
and then all you need
is a little push.

00:30:12,412 --> 00:30:14,416
But first you disable
the backup chute,

00:30:14,416 --> 00:30:16,587
so that when he crashes
to the Earth,

00:30:16,587 --> 00:30:18,524
nothing left of him
to trace back to you.

00:30:18,524 --> 00:30:21,632
After all, he was just
another reckless flyboy.

00:30:21,632 --> 00:30:23,502
Stole a suit,
went for a joyride.

00:30:23,502 --> 00:30:26,174
Not a bad plan if
you're Claudia Mason,

00:30:26,174 --> 00:30:29,147
and you're coming up
with it on the fly.

00:30:29,147 --> 00:30:30,082
Yeah.

00:30:30,483 --> 00:30:33,489
But like all things
on the fly...

00:30:33,489 --> 00:30:36,529
I'm betting that there's
something that she missed.

00:30:48,688 --> 00:30:50,692
You sure about
your theory?

00:30:50,692 --> 00:30:53,263
I'm just saying, doesn't even
look like anybody's been here.

00:30:53,263 --> 00:30:55,435
Well, Claudia Mason
must have cleaned up.

00:30:55,435 --> 00:30:58,741
Let's just hope she's a better
CEO than she is a maid.

00:31:11,601 --> 00:31:13,305
Balcony.

00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:15,709
Where Holland
started his flight.

00:31:18,315 --> 00:31:19,283
I got some blood.

00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:24,127
Like Russell said--

00:31:24,127 --> 00:31:26,232
Claudia must have
missed something.

00:31:35,216 --> 00:31:36,118
Would you hit the lights?

00:31:42,765 --> 00:31:43,667
BRODY:
Wow.

00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,006
That is one serious blood pool.

00:31:46,006 --> 00:31:47,141
Well, it doesn't
end there.

00:31:48,578 --> 00:31:50,347
Got some blood drops.

00:31:56,127 --> 00:31:57,062
And cast-off.

00:31:57,396 --> 00:32:00,235
You thought the guy stroked out
from HACE, right?

00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:01,805
Well, that's what I thought,
but... I mean,

00:32:01,805 --> 00:32:03,642
these blood patterns
suggest something different.

00:32:03,642 --> 00:32:05,413
More violent.

00:32:05,413 --> 00:32:06,782
This is from a brutal beating.

00:32:06,782 --> 00:32:10,089
It's a crime
of passion.

00:32:11,091 --> 00:32:12,727
You know how they always say,

00:32:12,727 --> 00:32:15,333
"The cover-up is worse
than the crime"?

00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,337
Not this time.

00:32:22,648 --> 00:32:26,089
So, what does our CEO
have to say for herself?

00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:28,093
Not a whole hell
of a lot, really.

00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:30,097
She denies knowing
anything about Holland

00:32:30,097 --> 00:32:32,802
going up to the condo to do
his BASE-jumping, so...

00:32:32,802 --> 00:32:34,406
So she denies
having an affair, too?

00:32:34,406 --> 00:32:35,408
Oh, yeah.
(sighs)

00:32:36,075 --> 00:32:37,212
Well, look, the first time,

00:32:37,212 --> 00:32:38,447
she was hiding behind
the Air Force.

00:32:38,447 --> 00:32:39,683
This time,
she's hiding behind

00:32:39,683 --> 00:32:42,122
that $800-an-hour lawyer.

00:32:42,122 --> 00:32:43,357
Well, if she won't talk,

00:32:43,357 --> 00:32:45,596
her condo definitely will.

00:32:45,596 --> 00:33:03,633
♪ ♪

00:33:03,633 --> 00:33:35,532
♪ ♪

00:33:35,532 --> 00:33:39,573
Well, no crime of passion
starts without the passion.

00:33:39,573 --> 00:33:40,810
There were no prints
on the murder weapon.

00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,881
But once we run the blood,
the fiber, the hairs,

00:33:42,881 --> 00:33:45,452
maybe we can prove Claudia
was here, killing him, too.

00:33:45,452 --> 00:33:47,490
She may not have been
the one wanting to kill him.

00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,461
Just got the security
camera footage from the lobby,

00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:51,265
the night Holland died.

00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,145
That's Holland's wife.

00:33:58,145 --> 00:34:00,316
The show is just
getting started.

00:34:06,496 --> 00:34:08,633
RUSSELL:
You lied to us, Amanda.

00:34:09,837 --> 00:34:13,578
You told me you hadn't seen
your husband in days.

00:34:13,578 --> 00:34:15,180
And that the night
he was killed,

00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,621
you assumed he was on
a training mission for TRP.

00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:21,427
This video says you knew
exactly where he was.

00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:21,961
And he was on more

00:34:21,961 --> 00:34:24,333
than just
a "training mission."

00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,237
Look, I know what this
looks like, but you're wrong.

00:34:26,237 --> 00:34:29,309
No, I'll tell you
what's wrong--

00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:30,479
you coming to me

00:34:30,479 --> 00:34:32,350
asking me to find out
what happened

00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,587
to your husband,
when you knew all along.

00:34:34,587 --> 00:34:36,725
No. It is not like that.

00:34:36,725 --> 00:34:37,393
CRAWFORD:
Okay.

00:34:37,393 --> 00:34:38,897
Tell us what it's like, then.

00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:44,742
The past few months,
Bobby has been different.

00:34:44,742 --> 00:34:46,445
At first, I thought
it was just this new job

00:34:46,445 --> 00:34:48,983
at TRP, I mean...

00:34:48,983 --> 00:34:51,722
But a woman knows

00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:53,994
when her husband is...

00:34:54,896 --> 00:34:56,465
Is what?

00:34:57,535 --> 00:34:58,838
Straying?

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,318
He said he was going
to TRP that night,

00:35:05,318 --> 00:35:06,486
and I followed him.

00:35:06,486 --> 00:35:07,755
CRAWFORD:
Downtown.

00:35:07,755 --> 00:35:09,861
To the condo.
Yes. And I
confronted him.

00:35:09,861 --> 00:35:11,798
And I was going to
confront that woman, too,

00:35:11,798 --> 00:35:12,833
whoever she was.

00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:14,470
But on the way up
in the elevator,

00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,808
Bobby swore to me
that he was innocent.

00:35:16,808 --> 00:35:19,313
That he really was there
training that night.

00:35:19,313 --> 00:35:21,451
He was doing a BASE jump
from a condo tower.

00:35:21,451 --> 00:35:23,823
He showed me his wingsuit,
he showed me his gear,

00:35:23,823 --> 00:35:24,758
and I...

00:35:24,758 --> 00:35:25,894
I had to believe him.

00:35:25,894 --> 00:35:27,329
I didn't want to lose him.

00:35:27,329 --> 00:35:28,799
RUSSELL: So you didn't
go up to the condo,

00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:30,803
you didn't continue the fight

00:35:30,803 --> 00:35:33,376
and you didn't kill your husband
in a jealous rage.

00:35:33,376 --> 00:35:35,647
Am I getting that right?

00:35:35,647 --> 00:35:37,317
I didn't kill Bobby.

00:35:37,985 --> 00:35:40,758
I'm sorry that I lied to you
about seeing him that night.

00:35:40,758 --> 00:35:41,760
And Major Mills is right--

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,463
Bobby didn't
follow the rules.

00:35:43,463 --> 00:35:43,897
He lived on the edge.

00:35:43,897 --> 00:35:45,668
And jumping from a tower

00:35:45,668 --> 00:35:47,605
in the middle of the city
was against regulations.

00:35:47,605 --> 00:35:50,544
You lied to us
just so that you could keep

00:35:50,544 --> 00:35:52,715
his death benefits.

00:35:52,883 --> 00:35:54,385
Yeah.

00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:56,056
And preserve his memory.

00:35:58,728 --> 00:36:00,598
And I'm not lying to you now.

00:36:00,598 --> 00:36:01,801
Then you won't mind giving us

00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:04,440
a blood and DNA sample,
will you?

00:36:06,777 --> 00:36:09,016
HODGES:
<i>Nick, you need to see this.</i>

00:36:09,016 --> 00:36:09,684
What is it?

00:36:09,684 --> 00:36:13,459
Expanded tox panel on
Air Force Captain Ferris.

00:36:13,459 --> 00:36:14,527
I don't think
it's any accident

00:36:14,527 --> 00:36:16,631
that he stroked out on
you in Interrogation.

00:36:16,631 --> 00:36:19,738
Tested positive for furosemide.

00:36:19,738 --> 00:36:20,539
Isn't that a diuretic?

00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:22,477
A hard-core diuretic,

00:36:22,477 --> 00:36:25,817
often abused by models
and bodybuilders

00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:27,421
to get that "cut" look.

00:36:27,421 --> 00:36:28,656
Ferris' medical
records make

00:36:28,656 --> 00:36:30,059
no mention of any prescription.

00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:31,929
Okay, so the guy was
on a diuretic.

00:36:31,929 --> 00:36:33,566
I don't see how
that would kill him.

00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,337
Flip the page.

00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,911
You'll see that
the furosemide

00:36:38,911 --> 00:36:40,948
caused a major
sodium imbalance.

00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:44,088
For a guy logging that many
hours in a hypobaric chamber,

00:36:44,088 --> 00:36:45,758
it makes for
a lethal combination.

00:36:47,328 --> 00:36:48,631
Makes for murder.

00:36:49,032 --> 00:37:20,130
♪ ♪

00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:39,035
♪ ♪

00:37:39,035 --> 00:37:39,904
Hey, Henry.

00:37:39,904 --> 00:37:40,972
Got your text.

00:37:40,972 --> 00:37:42,809
You have results on
the DNA from the condo?

00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:45,649
I do-- uh, blood is a match
to the victim, Captain Holland.

00:37:45,649 --> 00:37:49,557
Okay, uh, what about the bed?
The murder weapon?

00:37:49,557 --> 00:37:51,127
I found semen contribution

00:37:51,127 --> 00:37:52,797
from Holland in the bed...

00:37:52,797 --> 00:37:54,033
Just cut to the chase.

00:37:54,033 --> 00:37:55,703
Which woman killed him?

00:37:55,703 --> 00:37:57,139
The wife? Or the boss?

00:37:57,139 --> 00:37:59,878
The boss was in
bed with him.

00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:01,883
But not the one
you're thinking of.

00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:03,920
Your DNA in the bed,

00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,991
and your DNA on
the murder weapon.

00:38:05,991 --> 00:38:08,797
Mrs. Holland knew her husband
was having an affair.

00:38:08,797 --> 00:38:12,170
She just didn't know it was
with his commanding officer.

00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,075
FINLAY:
Would you like to tell us what
happened that night, Major?

00:38:14,075 --> 00:38:16,145
Help us understand.

00:38:16,947 --> 00:38:19,552
You know, maybe it'll
help a jury understand.

00:38:28,638 --> 00:38:30,141
He said he was
going to leave me.

00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,445
Said he was afraid.

00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:33,447
CRAWFORD:
Of what?

00:38:33,447 --> 00:38:34,149
Afraid of getting caught?

00:38:34,149 --> 00:38:35,919
It wasn't just an affair.

00:38:35,919 --> 00:38:37,088
And there is no way that you

00:38:37,088 --> 00:38:39,560
or anybody can understand that.

00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:43,802
You could try us.

00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:48,713
I loved him.

00:38:51,017 --> 00:38:52,954
And I thought that
he loved me, too.

00:38:55,827 --> 00:38:59,501
He said his wife was
asking questions,

00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:01,739
and that she followed him
to the condo that night.

00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:05,581
Can you believe it?

00:39:05,581 --> 00:39:09,254
For a second,
I was actually relieved.

00:39:09,254 --> 00:39:11,526
I thought maybe this meant

00:39:11,526 --> 00:39:13,731
that we could...

00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:18,073
stop living the lie.

00:39:18,073 --> 00:39:19,643
But he didn't feel
that way, did he?

00:39:21,547 --> 00:39:23,585
No.

00:39:23,585 --> 00:39:24,119
It's over.

00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:25,255
Don't you understand that?

00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:26,791
I love my wife.
You love me.

00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:27,860
How can you deny
who you are?

00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,963
Who <i>we</i> are?

00:39:28,963 --> 00:39:30,732
Deny? This coming from you?

00:39:30,732 --> 00:39:32,636
Your whole life is denial.

00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:34,741
I had to make
sacrifices for my career.

00:39:34,741 --> 00:39:37,179
Yeah, and me, too.

00:39:37,179 --> 00:39:40,051
And now I'm making
another sacrifice.

00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:44,962
I'm sorry, but...

00:39:44,962 --> 00:39:45,831
we're done.

00:39:48,068 --> 00:39:50,908
Don't turn your
back on me.

00:39:50,908 --> 00:39:54,882
(yelling fiercely)

00:40:00,762 --> 00:40:02,833
I panicked.

00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:05,170
I... I cleaned up the condo
as best I could.

00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,740
CRAWFORD:
Yeah, you put him
in the wingsuit

00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,911
and you sabotaged the
chute so it wouldn't open.

00:40:08,911 --> 00:40:10,648
FINLAY:
Or, at the very least,

00:40:10,648 --> 00:40:12,719
make Claudia and TRP
the fall guy.

00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:17,162
Is that why Ferris
had to die, too?

00:40:17,162 --> 00:40:18,632
Yeah, well,
we searched your place.

00:40:18,632 --> 00:40:21,771
And, um, we found this.

00:40:21,771 --> 00:40:24,244
It's furosemide.

00:40:24,244 --> 00:40:26,114
What was your plan, Major?

00:40:26,114 --> 00:40:28,285
I mean, you slip some
into his coffee,

00:40:28,285 --> 00:40:29,922
you hope he strokes out

00:40:29,922 --> 00:40:31,626
in the hypobaric chamber?

00:40:31,626 --> 00:40:32,761
But it didn't work out
that way, right?

00:40:32,761 --> 00:40:35,667
He was a strong
test pilot.

00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:37,804
Took a few extra hours.

00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:42,949
Bobby and Ferris
were best friends.

00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:45,020
If anybody knew the truth
about us, it was him.

00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,255
I...

00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:51,198
had no choice.

00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,237
Major...

00:40:53,637 --> 00:40:56,677
You always have a choice.

00:40:56,677 --> 00:40:59,082
And you chose wrong.

00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,286
Twice.

00:41:09,937 --> 00:41:11,107
Mrs. Holland?

00:41:11,107 --> 00:41:12,309
You still waiting
for something?

00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:13,632
Haven't they finished
with you yet?

00:41:13,632 --> 00:41:15,434
No, they said I could go.

00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:17,536
I just...

00:41:17,536 --> 00:41:19,505
I mean, go where?

00:41:19,505 --> 00:41:21,941
Home is empty.

00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:24,577
It's always going
to be empty.

00:41:26,979 --> 00:41:31,851
I'm so sorry.

00:41:31,851 --> 00:41:33,018
For everything.

00:41:33,018 --> 00:41:35,488
Your husband...

00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,856
You were just doing your job.

00:41:36,856 --> 00:41:40,659
I understand.

00:41:42,862 --> 00:41:44,897
Do you keep secrets
from your wife?

00:41:46,766 --> 00:41:49,468
I used to.

00:41:49,468 --> 00:41:50,970
Not anymore?

00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:52,037
No.

00:41:56,475 --> 00:41:58,677
She's a lucky woman, then.

00:42:00,513 --> 00:42:01,547
Excuse me.
