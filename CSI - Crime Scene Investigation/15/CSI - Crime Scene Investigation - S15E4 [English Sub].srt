00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:05,210
Welcome to Jefferson High,
home of the Pelicans.

00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,147
Pelican pride.

00:00:07,147 --> 00:00:09,319
Pelicans are, by the way,
a shore bird--

00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:11,190
<i>Pelecanus occidentalis.</i>

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,694
A water bird mascot
in the desert?

00:00:13,694 --> 00:00:16,367
Ooh, here comes
Principal Meadows.

00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:19,206
(laughs) Hi. Did you have
a good weekend, Mason?
Mm-hmm.

00:00:19,206 --> 00:00:21,410
Um, what about
that football game?

00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,080
Ah, Turk was fantastic.

00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,051
Oh, go... Pelicans!

00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:26,353
Wait!

00:00:28,124 --> 00:00:30,028
Turk can't name
the vice president.

00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:31,298
No joke.

00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:33,702
And he's one failed test away
from flunking out.

00:00:33,702 --> 00:00:35,372
Ooh, but don't take
my word for it.

00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:37,043
Hey, Turk.

00:00:37,043 --> 00:00:39,047
70 yards passing, not bad!

00:00:39,047 --> 00:00:40,649
Oh, Chugga-Brew.
I want to talk to you.

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,186
Uh, I'm busy, Turk.

00:00:42,186 --> 00:00:44,357
Come on, man. This vertex of the
para-boola is driving me nuts.

00:00:44,357 --> 00:00:46,361
You're the only one who can
explain it to me.

00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:47,764
Maybe next time.

00:00:47,764 --> 00:00:50,704
I almost feel sorry for him.

00:00:50,704 --> 00:00:52,474
GIRL:
What up, boy?

00:00:52,474 --> 00:00:57,116
Aw, is Mason making a little
selfie video for his mommy?

00:00:57,116 --> 00:00:58,586
Hi, Mason.

00:00:58,586 --> 00:01:00,690
Come on, Hannah,
give it back.

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,367
Wow, this thing is, like,
five generations old.

00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:08,172
Pretty lame for a tech geek.

00:01:08,172 --> 00:01:09,742
What do you want?

00:01:09,742 --> 00:01:12,581
World peace, Mason. World peace.

00:01:14,184 --> 00:01:15,621
Great talk.

00:01:15,621 --> 00:01:18,827
You know, I still can't believe
you don't have a girlfriend.

00:01:19,328 --> 00:01:22,234
Right here, Mason...

00:01:22,234 --> 00:01:23,771
Hannah's my next-door neighbor.

00:01:23,771 --> 00:01:26,343
We used to play kick the can
and hang out,

00:01:26,343 --> 00:01:27,712
but then she got her braces off.

00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,215
Hey, sweetie.

00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:32,121
Remember to take the car in
after school-- oil change.

00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:33,357
I know.

00:01:33,357 --> 00:01:35,194
You told me a billion times.

00:01:35,194 --> 00:01:36,864
(sighs)
That's my mom.

00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:38,200
She teaches earth science here.

00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,774
Ah, famous Pelican cheerleaders.

00:01:41,774 --> 00:01:43,578
Good news, bad news.

00:01:43,578 --> 00:01:45,147
Bad news-- it's eighth period.

00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:48,755
Good news-- it's eighth period.
(booming)

00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,227
(screaming)

00:01:51,227 --> 00:01:53,098
Holy crap, he's...

00:01:53,098 --> 00:01:55,168
My God, someone call 911!

00:01:55,168 --> 00:01:57,506
Grab a blanket, get some water!
Call 911!

00:01:57,506 --> 00:02:00,112
I got you, Chet,
I got you.

00:02:00,112 --> 00:02:01,647
Call an ambulance! Now!

00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,330
Ed...

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,767
is he...?

00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,779
PRINCIPAL:
Everybody, report
to your homerooms.

00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:18,482
ED:
Everybody, go back
to class, come on.

00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:20,486
(indistinct chatter)

00:02:36,553 --> 00:02:37,655
SANDERS:
Hey, Dave.

00:02:37,655 --> 00:02:38,723
Hey.

00:02:38,723 --> 00:02:40,727
Any I.D. on our burning man?

00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,832
Chet Messner.

00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:44,335
Taught chemistry.

00:02:44,335 --> 00:02:45,604
Sadly appropriate,

00:02:45,604 --> 00:02:48,577
given his extreme thermal
and chemical burns.

00:02:48,577 --> 00:02:50,147
Fourth degree charring.

00:02:50,147 --> 00:02:51,282
No one's gonna
survive that.

00:02:51,282 --> 00:02:52,451
Nope.

00:02:52,451 --> 00:02:53,921
Any luck
retracing his steps?

00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:55,224
Yeah.

00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:57,863
Uh, looks like the vic was
in the classroom

00:02:57,863 --> 00:02:58,865
when something went wrong.

00:02:58,865 --> 00:03:00,668
That's an understatement.

00:03:00,668 --> 00:03:02,238
Clearly there was
an explosion.

00:03:02,238 --> 00:03:04,743
It appears he was doing some
prep work for an experiment.

00:03:04,743 --> 00:03:07,482
So, we're looking
at an accident.

00:03:07,482 --> 00:03:09,453
Maybe not, actually.

00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:11,523
Look, I, um, I found
his cell phone.

00:03:11,523 --> 00:03:13,527
He received an anonymous
text this morning.

00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,265
"Epic fail, Messner.

00:03:15,265 --> 00:03:16,400
"Do the right thing,

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,906
or suffer the consequences."

00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:19,941
So much for an accident.

00:03:19,941 --> 00:03:22,880
Well, looks like Messner
did the <i>wrong</i> thing.

00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:25,853
And got burned.

00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,773
♪&amp; Who... are you? ♪&amp;

00:03:35,773 --> 00:03:38,312

00:04:01,292 --> 00:04:03,229
PRINCIPAL:
I still can't believe it.

00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:05,935
I mean, my goodness, Chet's
always been so careful.

00:04:05,935 --> 00:04:08,774
Makes an explosion in his lab
all the more puzzling.

00:04:08,774 --> 00:04:10,811
So, I understand
it was eighth period.

00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:12,815
Wasn't he teaching
a class?

00:04:12,815 --> 00:04:15,353
Uh, no. He normally
grades papers then,

00:04:15,353 --> 00:04:16,690
or makes his
lesson plans.

00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,560
Did you know
Mr. Messner well?

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,297
Oh, yeah.

00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:22,034
About five years now.

00:04:22,034 --> 00:04:24,506
He'd always throw great
barbecues on the Fourth.

00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:26,276
The whole
faculty would go.

00:04:26,276 --> 00:04:27,345
And what about
his students?

00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:28,547
Did he get along
with them?

00:04:28,547 --> 00:04:31,753
You don't think someone
deliberately hurt Chet?

00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:32,622
We don't
know yet.

00:04:32,622 --> 00:04:35,561
But I am going to need a list
of all of his students' names.

00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:36,764
The students
loved Chet.

00:04:36,764 --> 00:04:38,835
He put in a lot
of time here.

00:04:38,835 --> 00:04:41,406
In fact, right now he
would be setting up

00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:45,047
for tomorrow's Pelican
rally if... he hadn't...

00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,855
Well, I'm sorry
for your loss, Ms. Meadows.

00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,792
Thanks for your time.
Yeah.

00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:55,502
How was your meeting
with the principal?

00:04:55,502 --> 00:04:58,575
According to her, everyone just
loved good old Mr. Messner.

00:04:58,575 --> 00:05:00,011
Until someone didn't.

00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:01,982
We need our, uh,
bunny suits?

00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:03,552
I did a sweep.

00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:06,725
Air samples are clear
of hazardous chemicals.

00:05:06,725 --> 00:05:08,328
So you get to
be bunny-free.

00:05:08,328 --> 00:05:10,867
Well, I guess that means
we're late for class.

00:05:10,867 --> 00:05:12,871
Aren't you gonna
carry my kit?

00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:15,409
No.

00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,726
First responders said the
sprinklers put out the fire.

00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:26,833
The gas was still on,
so they shut it off.

00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,004
And it didn't look
like the gas line

00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:30,674
had been tampered
with at all.

00:05:30,674 --> 00:05:32,110
But take a
look at this.

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,380
Bunsen burner...

00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,417
says that Mr. Messner
was working

00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:36,619
on one of his
lesson plans.

00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:39,325
The burn marks that are
radiating outwards

00:05:39,325 --> 00:05:41,563
say that this may be
the point of origin.

00:05:41,563 --> 00:05:43,767
Question is--
what set it off?

00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:45,972
Fire needs
an accelerant.

00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:47,441
So, what are
you thinking?

00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,647
The scorching marks...

00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:52,919
are going this way.

00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:00,602
I think I might have found
our accelerant.

00:06:04,008 --> 00:06:06,080
Whatever was in here

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,686
must have shot across the table
like a rocket.

00:06:09,686 --> 00:06:12,525
Yep, singed
and blackened.

00:06:12,525 --> 00:06:14,496
How am I doing so far?

00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:17,937
Ms. Brody?

00:06:19,006 --> 00:06:20,843
Hey, you're not
paying attention.

00:06:20,843 --> 00:06:23,915
It's 'cause I'm forming
my own theory, professor.

00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:25,986
It's here-- gummy bears.

00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,558
On his crazy-tidy shelf.

00:06:28,558 --> 00:06:31,398
You know the saying that,
uh, sugar gives you energy?

00:06:31,398 --> 00:06:32,667
Yeah.

00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:34,837
I think that Messner was
gonna try to prove that.

00:06:34,837 --> 00:06:36,107
It's on his
whiteboard there.

00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:37,978
Tomorrow's
lesson plan.

00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:39,447
That's what he
was prepping.

00:06:39,447 --> 00:06:41,719
Molten potassium chlorate

00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:43,823
combined with glucose.

00:06:43,823 --> 00:06:47,029
Potassium chlorate-- that's an
accelerant, used in fireworks.

00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:48,666
Makes for quite a show.

00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,607
BRODY: <i>In fact, it's</i>
<i>such a powerful oxidizer,</i>

00:06:52,607 --> 00:06:54,678
<i>that when you add</i>
<i>the gummy bear or the sugar,</i>

00:06:54,678 --> 00:06:57,818
<i>it reacts violently.</i>

00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,888
<i>Makes a loud noise,</i>
<i>causes lots of flames.</i>

00:06:59,888 --> 00:07:01,058
<i>It's kind of</i>
<i>like a Roman candle.</i>

00:07:02,027 --> 00:07:03,997
Well, like
a Roman candle,

00:07:03,997 --> 00:07:05,835
there should be
no explosion.

00:07:05,835 --> 00:07:07,905
It was supposed to be a
controlled experiment.

00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:10,945
Until you add the X
factor to the equation.

00:07:10,945 --> 00:07:11,913
The killer.

00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:19,896
(screams)

00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:22,668
"Epic fail, Messner.

00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:25,875
Do the right thing,
or suffer the consequences."

00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:32,455
We traced this text
to your phone, Mason.

00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:34,092
I-I'm sorry.

00:07:34,092 --> 00:07:36,163
I was just...
venting.

00:07:36,163 --> 00:07:37,966
I didn't really
mean it, I swear.

00:07:37,966 --> 00:07:40,004
You sent a threatening
text, Mason.

00:07:40,004 --> 00:07:43,778
In this day and age, these
things are taken very seriously.

00:07:43,778 --> 00:07:45,147
Look, Mom, it was stupid.
I know.

00:07:46,951 --> 00:07:49,056
Mr. Russell, this is
really unlike him.

00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:50,759
I'm not just
speaking as a mom,

00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,062
I'm speaking as
a faculty member.

00:07:52,062 --> 00:07:54,567
Mason's on the honor roll.

00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:55,970
He is a good kid.

00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,174
You good at chemistry,
too, Mason?

00:07:58,174 --> 00:08:00,545
I sent a text, all right?

00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:03,084
But I did not inferno
Mr. Messner.

00:08:04,186 --> 00:08:06,057
I-I was mad.

00:08:06,057 --> 00:08:08,061
He gave me a B+
for the semester.

00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:10,031
I missed a few days
here and there.

00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:13,539
I was sick.

00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:15,076
And he wouldn't give me a break.

00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:16,678
Why didn't you talk to him?

00:08:16,678 --> 00:08:18,015
I did.

00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:20,186
Like a lot of people
around here,

00:08:20,186 --> 00:08:22,524
he held me
to a higher standard.

00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:25,062
Chet could be
very stubborn.

00:08:25,062 --> 00:08:27,133
And that does not
justify what you did.

00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:30,106
The consequences you said that
Mr. Messner would suffer,

00:08:30,106 --> 00:08:31,208
what'd you mean by that?

00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,912
I heard those lines
from a movie,

00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,984
it was... it was
just a bluff.

00:08:35,984 --> 00:08:37,988
I just wanted my "A."

00:08:37,988 --> 00:08:40,961
Because people expect
big things from me.

00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:45,704
(choking up): And I didn't want
to let you down.

00:08:45,704 --> 00:08:49,045
And I know... I know how much
all this means to you.

00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:51,249
And...
Mason.

00:08:51,249 --> 00:08:53,186
You could never
let me down.

00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,798
Mr. Russell, does my
son need a lawyer?

00:08:58,798 --> 00:09:00,935
No, not at the moment.

00:09:08,117 --> 00:09:11,992
Doc, can you explain this
text I got from Hodges?

00:09:11,992 --> 00:09:16,133
Okay, "Nobody knows
what the nose knows

00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:19,641
until the nose
knows it. See Doc."

00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:21,210
Our friend, Hodges, has the gene

00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,283
that allows him to smell the
bitter almond odor of cyanide.

00:09:24,283 --> 00:09:25,653
It's a gift.

00:09:25,653 --> 00:09:26,855
Mmm, he has
so many gifts.

00:09:26,855 --> 00:09:27,857
Oh, yeah.

00:09:27,857 --> 00:09:30,696
Note this pink lividity.

00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:34,037
Indicative of cyanide poisoning.

00:09:34,037 --> 00:09:36,976
Mr. Messner would have been
a goner, fire or no fire.

00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:40,149
So, Messner was poisoned
before the explosion.

00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:42,988
Killer did not push him
into the flames,

00:09:42,988 --> 00:09:44,591
but he did dose
him with cyanide.

00:09:44,591 --> 00:09:46,361
In sufficient quantity
to cause him to seize

00:09:46,361 --> 00:09:48,866
at a most inopportune time.

00:09:54,945 --> 00:09:57,918
(screams)

00:09:57,918 --> 00:09:59,989
Well, that changes everything.

00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:02,627
Killer didn't have to be
in the classroom.

00:10:03,196 --> 00:10:04,665
Do you know how he was dosed?

00:10:04,665 --> 00:10:06,770
Normally cyanide presents
in the stomach lining

00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:07,905
and nasal passages.

00:10:07,905 --> 00:10:09,876
But I found
no signs of this.

00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,947
So he didn't eat it,
and he didn't snort it.

00:10:11,947 --> 00:10:13,951
What else do you know about him?

00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:15,019
Uh, he was single,

00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:17,124
been in Vegas for
about five years,

00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:18,627
no record. Why?

00:10:18,627 --> 00:10:20,231
Well, he was wearing this.

00:10:20,231 --> 00:10:22,902
It's called a life rune.

00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:24,239
It's a gang symbol.

00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:27,011
Two weeks ago,
I saw the same symbol.

00:10:27,011 --> 00:10:29,349
It was tattooed
on a dead biker's ass.

00:10:29,349 --> 00:10:31,219
Blended nicely
with his swastikas.

00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:33,691
So, our lovable teacher,
Chet Messner,

00:10:33,691 --> 00:10:35,662
may have had a dark secret.

00:10:46,884 --> 00:10:48,021
This a bad time,
Russ?

00:10:48,021 --> 00:10:49,056
I got something
for you.

00:10:49,056 --> 00:10:50,292
Come on in.

00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:52,831
I ran Messner's
credit cards.

00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:54,667
Now, one thing
really popped out.

00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:55,970
He's been ordering
monthly shipments

00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,272
of red phosphorus powder.

00:10:57,272 --> 00:10:59,711
Man's a chemistry
teacher, though, right?

00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,382
He got it from some
shady supplier online.

00:11:02,382 --> 00:11:04,286
And he got it
delivered to his house.

00:11:04,286 --> 00:11:07,694
Some little place
out on Sloan Canyon.
What are you thinking?

00:11:07,694 --> 00:11:09,965
We both know what red phosphorus
powder is used for.

00:11:09,965 --> 00:11:12,103
Chemistry teacher dealing meth.

00:11:12,103 --> 00:11:13,372
Good show.

00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,908
I'm just saying,

00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,447
Messner may have some enemies
we haven't considered.

00:11:17,447 --> 00:11:19,986
Maybe he stepped
on the wrong dealer's turf.

00:11:19,986 --> 00:11:21,689
Yeah, and then that dealer goes
back to that school,

00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:23,392
and gives Messner
a big old fat "F" in meth class.

00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:25,129
Go get 'em.

00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:27,735
(siren wailing)

00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:31,342
Main house is clear.

00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:33,413
Really?

00:11:33,413 --> 00:11:35,082
All right, we'll
check the shed.

00:11:55,123 --> 00:11:57,362
STOKES:
There's a knife.

00:11:57,362 --> 00:12:00,435
With what looks
like blood on it right there.

00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:03,374
This doesn't look
like a meth lab to me.

00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:06,313
Man, these are some
creepy-ass tapestries.

00:12:08,317 --> 00:12:11,858
CRAWFORD: I think it might
be more than just that.

00:12:12,392 --> 00:12:15,899
I've seen
this stuff before.

00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:17,369
Double in
the Alphabets.

00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,776
This, uh,
this whack-job...

00:12:20,776 --> 00:12:23,515
he killed a couple
as a sacrifice.

00:12:23,515 --> 00:12:25,786
To the moon god.

00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,890
So, what is this,
devil worship?

00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,427
No, not exactly.

00:12:29,427 --> 00:12:30,763
Stokes.

00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:34,303
Book of Shadows.
What's that?

00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:35,472
It's like a book of spells.

00:12:35,472 --> 00:12:37,911
This is a ceremonial altar
and a cauldron.

00:12:37,911 --> 00:12:40,784
The only thing that's missing
is a broom.

00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:43,388
Our chemistry teacher's a witch.

00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:50,470
Air, fire, water, earth,

00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,808
elements of astral birth,

00:12:52,808 --> 00:12:57,284
I call on thee,
and offer these gifts.

00:12:58,786 --> 00:13:00,090
RUSSELL:
<i>"I call you now...</i>

00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,325
"Attend to me.

00:13:01,325 --> 00:13:02,962
"This is my will.

00:13:02,962 --> 00:13:05,200
So mote it be."

00:13:07,104 --> 00:13:08,507
What happens next?

00:13:08,507 --> 00:13:09,509
No, wait.

00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:10,544
Don't tell me.

00:13:10,544 --> 00:13:12,047
Let me guess.

00:13:12,047 --> 00:13:13,550
Lightning strikes,
right?

00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,523
No, coven meeting starts.

00:13:16,523 --> 00:13:18,060
Sounds like you've been to one.

00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,166
Actually, my parents befriended
a Wiccan couple

00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,435
back in the '60s.

00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,072
So I know a little
bit about it.

00:13:24,072 --> 00:13:25,274
It's a pagan
religion.

00:13:25,274 --> 00:13:29,282
They use spells to harness
the earth's energy

00:13:29,282 --> 00:13:30,986
to grant positive wishes.

00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,194
That's the sign of the devil
right there.

00:13:35,194 --> 00:13:36,329
The five-pointed star?

00:13:36,831 --> 00:13:40,004
No, that's a sign of balance
and strength, actually.

00:13:40,004 --> 00:13:42,242
It's a protective symbol.

00:13:42,242 --> 00:13:44,280
I always thought it was
a sign of the devil.

00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,315
Well, you're wrong.

00:13:51,127 --> 00:13:52,262
Yeah.

00:13:52,262 --> 00:13:54,266
This is our red phosphorus
right here.

00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:58,041
I think Messner was making
magic, not meth, in here.

00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,076
Yes, the
question is--

00:13:59,076 --> 00:14:01,280
did magic lead to murder?

00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,419
Well, they were in here
mixing up potions.

00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:04,854
Maybe one of them...

00:14:04,854 --> 00:14:06,391
made a cyanide spell.

00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,896
There's a singed
hair in here.

00:14:08,896 --> 00:14:11,034
Looks human.

00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:13,572
A burnt human hair
in a cauldron?

00:14:13,572 --> 00:14:17,614
How does that work
in the hocus-pocus business?

00:14:17,614 --> 00:14:20,186
Well, that's a little
disturbing, actually.

00:14:20,186 --> 00:14:22,591
Why don't we turn
this place upside down,

00:14:22,591 --> 00:14:24,595
see if they left more
than a human hair behind.

00:14:48,978 --> 00:14:50,481
And he's wearing a robe.

00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:53,219
Helps me get into it.

00:14:53,219 --> 00:14:55,057
Come on, this is Vegas.

00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:56,260
Anything goes.

00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,929
Where <i>can't</i> you find
a relic Druid robe?

00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:00,568
Well, did the robe help?
It did.

00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:02,505
I think I know what
our witches were cooking

00:15:02,505 --> 00:15:04,443
in the Wiccan
kitchen.

00:15:04,443 --> 00:15:05,979
And if you'll step
into <i>my</i> Wiccan kitchen,

00:15:05,979 --> 00:15:06,981
I'll be happy to explain.

00:15:09,353 --> 00:15:12,225
Using a two-quart
cast-iron cauldron...

00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:15,365
<i>you add human blood,</i>
<i>a teaspoon of red phosphorus,</i>

00:15:15,365 --> 00:15:18,204
<i>then garnish with human hair.</i>
<i>You heat it all up</i>

00:15:18,204 --> 00:15:20,976
<i>until there is a gloomy smoke,</i>
<i>and then you have...</i>

00:15:20,976 --> 00:15:24,484
A group of sad lost people
inhaling toxic fumes?

00:15:24,484 --> 00:15:26,221
No.

00:15:26,221 --> 00:15:28,125
A banishment spell.

00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,598
ALL (chanting):
Charge this by your powers.

00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,068
Break this circle.

00:15:33,068 --> 00:15:35,072
Banish the leper.

00:15:35,072 --> 00:15:36,609
Let us be reborn.

00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:38,713
Since when are you
a Wicca expert?

00:15:38,713 --> 00:15:40,349
Dated one in college.

00:15:40,349 --> 00:15:41,384
Uh, she was intense.

00:15:41,384 --> 00:15:42,721
Perhaps too natural?

00:15:42,721 --> 00:15:44,190
Truth be told,

00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,994
uh, she didn't have
a bathing spell

00:15:45,994 --> 00:15:47,264
in her Book of Shadows.

00:15:47,264 --> 00:15:50,670
Okay, okay, let's just get
back to this... spell.

00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,676
Are you saying that Messner
was being banished?

00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:55,013
Thou art correct.

00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:56,415
I found one drop
of unburned blood

00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,019
on the lip
of the cauldron.

00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:00,724
Now, per the spell, it means
that Messner was the target.

00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:03,229
Suggests motive.

00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,634
Maybe Messner wasn't willing
to go quietly

00:16:05,634 --> 00:16:07,003
into that witchy night.

00:16:07,003 --> 00:16:10,544
So, another witch concocts
a deadly brew to silence him.

00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:14,051
Toil and trouble,
let the cyanide bubble.

00:16:14,252 --> 00:16:17,024
Any luck with the hair
in the cauldron?

00:16:17,124 --> 00:16:19,229
Henry found DNA
on the follicle.

00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,032
Unknown female,
no hits in CODIS.

00:16:21,032 --> 00:16:25,074
But the prints on the candle...
shed more light.

00:16:27,646 --> 00:16:30,652
In fact, I.D.'s
four of our witches.

00:16:30,652 --> 00:16:33,691
Turns out that Wiccans come
from all walks of life.

00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:35,595
Our first witch is
a postal worker,

00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,466
currently on vacation
in Florida.

00:16:37,466 --> 00:16:39,803
Okay, postal
worker's out.

00:16:39,803 --> 00:16:42,342
Witch number two is a
pharmaceutical saleswoman

00:16:42,342 --> 00:16:43,745
with a DUI
on her record.

00:16:43,745 --> 00:16:45,148
She's on the
road this week.

00:16:45,148 --> 00:16:46,484
Alibis her.

00:16:46,484 --> 00:16:49,456
But school was in session
for two of our other witches.

00:16:49,456 --> 00:16:51,594
Requiring that their
fingerprints, too,

00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:52,596
were in the system.

00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:56,772
<i>Witch number three is</i>
<i>our own Ms. Brewer.</i>

00:16:56,772 --> 00:16:58,742
<i>Earth science teacher,</i>
<i>spell caster.</i>

00:16:58,742 --> 00:17:00,613
Ms. Brewer?

00:17:00,613 --> 00:17:02,182
Didn't see that coming.

00:17:02,182 --> 00:17:04,621
How about the man who
tried to save Chet Messner?

00:17:05,055 --> 00:17:06,592
I call on thee...

00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,762
SANDERS:
<i>The janitor's a witch?</i>

00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:12,236
Why didn't you tell us that
you and Chet Messner were part

00:17:12,236 --> 00:17:14,541
of a secret society?

00:17:14,641 --> 00:17:16,345
There you go.

00:17:16,345 --> 00:17:17,413
It's a secret.

00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:19,552
Yeah, but secret-time
kind of goes away

00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:21,355
when it's
a homicide.

00:17:21,355 --> 00:17:24,528
Our religion had nothing to do
with what happened to Chet.

00:17:24,528 --> 00:17:25,764
Maybe it did.

00:17:25,764 --> 00:17:28,770
Could be a nervous witch, you
know, makes a cyanide potion

00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:31,509
to stop a fellow witch
from outing your gang.

00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,279
Isn't that what you guys
are really about?

00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,315
Curses and revenge?

00:17:34,315 --> 00:17:37,121
You have a wrong idea about us.

00:17:37,121 --> 00:17:39,725
Okay. Well, give me
the right one.

00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,663
Wicca saved me, Detective.

00:17:41,663 --> 00:17:43,768
Saved you?

00:17:43,768 --> 00:17:46,472
I came to Vegas to hustle cards.

00:17:46,472 --> 00:17:47,609
It ate me up.

00:17:48,811 --> 00:17:51,115
Left me a broke alcoholic.

00:17:51,115 --> 00:17:54,389
I found serenity
in the power of nature.

00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:56,260
Fact is, peace

00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,264
is at the core of our belief.

00:17:58,264 --> 00:17:59,366
That's what
we're about.

00:17:59,366 --> 00:18:00,401
If someone
hurt Chet,

00:18:00,401 --> 00:18:03,274
it came from the outside.

00:18:03,274 --> 00:18:05,678
The whole thing
was a shock to me.

00:18:05,678 --> 00:18:06,815
It was my second
gathering.

00:18:06,815 --> 00:18:08,685
Oh, so you're new to the craft.

00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:10,421
Yes, Chet asked me to join.

00:18:10,421 --> 00:18:12,626
And then he's banished.

00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:15,264
I didn't think that it was fair,
but I was new.

00:18:15,264 --> 00:18:16,835
And who was I
to question the coven?

00:18:16,835 --> 00:18:18,705
They all wanted him gone.

00:18:18,705 --> 00:18:20,141
Chet had been
speaking publically

00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,578
about coven
activities.

00:18:21,578 --> 00:18:24,684
Shoot his mouth off
to complete strangers.

00:18:24,684 --> 00:18:28,358
He thought it was a way
of getting out the message.

00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,662
How'd that
make you feel?

00:18:30,662 --> 00:18:31,899
Not good.

00:18:33,301 --> 00:18:35,172
But not bad enough to kill.

00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:39,414
Talking out of school is
why Chet was banished;

00:18:39,414 --> 00:18:40,917
it's not why he was murdered.

00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,658
A Wiccan doesn't kill.

00:18:45,326 --> 00:18:48,466
We have one unidentified
female member of the coven,

00:18:48,466 --> 00:18:49,601
but I need some names.

00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:51,605
I'm not allowed
to divulge names.

00:18:51,605 --> 00:18:52,774
I'm sorry.

00:18:52,774 --> 00:18:54,244
Oh.

00:18:54,244 --> 00:18:55,680
Well, I'm sorry, too.

00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,852
Because talking to members
of the coven,

00:18:57,852 --> 00:18:59,588
people who knew
Chet well--

00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:03,329
that's our best shot at figuring
out who hurt your friend.

00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:07,405
I have been lost...

00:19:07,405 --> 00:19:09,208
since my husband passed.

00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,746
And this might
sound corny,

00:19:11,746 --> 00:19:15,454
but there is a holiness
to the cosmos.

00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,625
A harmony.

00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,598
It helps me get
through the bad days.

00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:23,637
I owe it to them to
protect their privacy.

00:19:25,507 --> 00:19:27,278
I can't break a sacred oath.

00:19:27,278 --> 00:19:28,380
RUSSELL:
<i>What did you think?</i>

00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,650
You're asking me--

00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,921
do I think they're protecting
themselves or someone else?

00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,758
Yeah.

00:19:33,758 --> 00:19:35,528
(sighs)
I'm not sure.

00:19:35,528 --> 00:19:37,366
Well, they could be
telling the truth, right?

00:19:37,366 --> 00:19:38,635
I mean, I like to think

00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,572
that society's a little
more tolerant nowadays.

00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:43,311
Do we really think that a member
of a coven would be willing

00:19:43,311 --> 00:19:46,350
to kill another member
for fear of being exposed?

00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:49,858
I don't know, a banishment spell
for loose lips?

00:19:49,858 --> 00:19:51,394
I mean,
that tells me

00:19:51,394 --> 00:19:53,732
the first rule of witch club is,
"Don't talk about witch club."

00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:55,603
Greg.

00:19:55,603 --> 00:19:56,672
"Hop off
the broom,

00:19:56,672 --> 00:19:58,676
join me back on Planet Earth."

00:19:59,243 --> 00:20:00,546
He's very funny today.

00:20:00,546 --> 00:20:01,748
Hilarious.

00:20:03,852 --> 00:20:05,589
Hey, what do you got?

00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:08,897
Well, I think Messner was making
more than just Roman candles

00:20:08,897 --> 00:20:10,333
in his classroom.

00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,270
He was also making
a synthetic brew.

00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,543
I took a Dumpster dive behind
the school-- you're welcome--

00:20:15,543 --> 00:20:16,946
and I, uh, found this vial.

00:20:16,946 --> 00:20:19,317
Now, it's got to be
from Messner's lab

00:20:19,317 --> 00:20:20,754
because his prints
are all over it.

00:20:20,754 --> 00:20:23,292
Also found traces
of androstenedione

00:20:23,292 --> 00:20:24,295
and clostebol in it.

00:20:24,295 --> 00:20:26,432
So he <i>was</i> making drugs.

00:20:26,432 --> 00:20:27,568
Just not meth.

00:20:27,568 --> 00:20:28,570
Nope, steroids.

00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,378
I also found
this dosing schedule.

00:20:32,378 --> 00:20:34,850
His own "book of steroids."

00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,289
He was supplying PEDs to a lot
of Jefferson student-athletes.

00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:40,360
He even used code names.

00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,766
Note the, uh, most
popular client.

00:20:42,766 --> 00:20:43,768
"QB"?

00:20:43,768 --> 00:20:45,404
Not very subtle.

00:20:45,404 --> 00:20:47,709
No, apparently code names
weren't his strong suit.

00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:49,713
"Quarterback" is
Rob Turkla.

00:20:49,713 --> 00:20:53,521
Now this is
Mason Brewer's selfie video

00:20:53,521 --> 00:20:55,023
of Messner's
last seconds.

00:21:01,737 --> 00:21:04,309
Now, check out
the QB's locker.

00:21:06,413 --> 00:21:08,618
What is that, a traveling
medical kit?

00:21:08,618 --> 00:21:11,591
Complete with syringes
for your exotic destinations.

00:21:11,591 --> 00:21:12,960
Yeah, I'm thinking

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,432
that Turk doesn't travel much
beyond the football field.

00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:18,672
I, uh, pulled
Messner's phone records.

00:21:18,672 --> 00:21:20,809
Was he talking with Turk?

00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:22,713
Every Friday.

00:21:22,713 --> 00:21:24,484
So, we have a teacher
and a student involved

00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:27,356
in a highly
illicit scheme.

00:21:27,356 --> 00:21:29,560
Could have been bad for either
one of them if it had come out.

00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,431
But Messner had
other student clients,

00:21:31,431 --> 00:21:32,634
so why Turk?

00:21:32,634 --> 00:21:34,905
Well, first off,
Messner was broke.

00:21:34,905 --> 00:21:37,644
He had big credit card problems,
five cards he couldn't pay.

00:21:37,644 --> 00:21:41,519
Teacher's salary-- selling
drugs solves the problem, right.

00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:42,921
Well, two days ago,

00:21:42,921 --> 00:21:45,693
Messner sent
Turk an e-mail,

00:21:45,693 --> 00:21:47,364
threatening
to expose him.

00:21:47,364 --> 00:21:49,903
"No cash,
no college career for you

00:21:49,903 --> 00:21:51,338
"if this comes out.

00:21:51,338 --> 00:21:53,576
Be smart for once."

00:21:53,576 --> 00:21:56,015
I think QB was
stiffing Messner,

00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:58,352
and Messner wasn't having it.

00:21:58,352 --> 00:21:59,656
So he called an audible.

00:21:59,656 --> 00:22:01,091
Okay.

00:22:01,091 --> 00:22:02,628
Nice work.
I'll have Crawford

00:22:02,628 --> 00:22:03,630
pick Turk up.

00:22:06,536 --> 00:22:08,540
(indistinct radio chatter)

00:22:13,617 --> 00:22:15,521
Got your text.

00:22:15,521 --> 00:22:17,491
I got your suspect.

00:22:17,491 --> 00:22:19,495
I don't think
he's gonna be talking much.

00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:28,948
Hey, Dave...

00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:30,552
how's his head look?

00:22:30,552 --> 00:22:31,954
Well, I'm seeing blunt force

00:22:31,954 --> 00:22:33,925
trauma to the back of the skull.

00:22:33,925 --> 00:22:36,564
I'd say about
15 pounds' worth.

00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:37,733
PHILLIPS:
Yeah.

00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:38,635
That would do it.

00:22:40,138 --> 00:22:41,707
Well, the weight room's
just over there.

00:22:41,707 --> 00:22:43,779
I'm thinking
that the killer

00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,582
grabbed the murder weapon
from there, followed Turk

00:22:45,582 --> 00:22:46,584
from the weight room,

00:22:46,584 --> 00:22:48,889
then clocked him
here by the pool.

00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:50,559
PHILLIPS:
I think he was alive
when he went in the pool.

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,561
There's a thin band

00:22:51,561 --> 00:22:53,565
of foam at his mouth.

00:22:53,565 --> 00:22:54,701
Suggests drowning.

00:22:54,701 --> 00:22:55,836
One-two punch.

00:22:55,836 --> 00:22:57,707
<i>Blunt force trauma</i>

00:22:57,707 --> 00:22:59,577
<i>knocked him down...</i>

00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,485
...pool finished him off.

00:23:03,485 --> 00:23:06,591
Cleaning crew found the body
shortly after 6:00 a.m.

00:23:06,591 --> 00:23:09,130
Are there any security
cameras around here?
No.

00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,903
Swim team, they have the pool,
uh, up until 7:00,

00:23:11,903 --> 00:23:13,172
so nobody
saw anything.

00:23:13,172 --> 00:23:15,911
We have a suspect
turned vic.

00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:17,715
So what do you think?

00:23:17,715 --> 00:23:20,587
Two murders, two days,
one high school...

00:23:20,587 --> 00:23:23,727
Maybe the QB knew something
about the Messner murder.

00:23:23,727 --> 00:23:25,864
And drowned men
tell no tales.

00:23:27,634 --> 00:23:30,741
BRODY:
This is one
sheet of 92

00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:32,745
that were exposed to the fire
in Mr. Messner's classroom.

00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:33,747
I processed

00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:36,185
every single one.

00:23:36,185 --> 00:23:38,624
Okay. Why is this
one special?

00:23:38,624 --> 00:23:39,693
It's the murder weapon.

00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:42,899
This is getting fun.
The one thing

00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:44,569
we still haven't
been able to deduce

00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:46,172
is how the cyanide got
into Mr. Messner's body.

00:23:46,172 --> 00:23:48,176
But I have
an idea.

00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,181
Contact...
with the paper.

00:23:50,181 --> 00:23:53,821
This paper is coated
with a combination

00:23:53,821 --> 00:23:56,059
of cyanide
and dimethyl sulfoxide.

00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,897
DMSO.

00:23:57,897 --> 00:23:59,499
A solvent.

00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:01,036
One that can carry
substances into the skin.

00:24:01,036 --> 00:24:02,172
In this case,
cyanide.

00:24:02,172 --> 00:24:04,209
A massive
dose.

00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:06,480
Kind of like a chemical
hypodermic needle.

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,520
I don't think Messner
was the intended target.

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,758
This isn't just
any piece of paper.

00:24:11,758 --> 00:24:12,927
This is the answer key

00:24:12,927 --> 00:24:14,864
to Mr. Messner's Chem IV final,

00:24:14,864 --> 00:24:16,066
which was left in a drawer

00:24:16,066 --> 00:24:18,805
for his worst student,
Rob Turkla.

00:24:18,805 --> 00:24:19,240
Wait a minute.

00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,509
How do you
know that part?

00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:23,815
I found a very suspicious
VidTree image

00:24:23,815 --> 00:24:26,221
buried in Turk's
deleted phone data.

00:24:26,221 --> 00:24:28,191
RUSSELL:
"Touchdown. Your A+

00:24:28,191 --> 00:24:30,229
is in Messner's top drawer."

00:24:30,229 --> 00:24:31,665
Sent the day
he died.

00:24:31,665 --> 00:24:33,503
Do we know
by whom?

00:24:33,503 --> 00:24:35,205
VidTree
snapshots

00:24:35,205 --> 00:24:37,109
disappear after
a couple seconds.

00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,581
Kids use them, 'cause they think
that they can send something

00:24:39,581 --> 00:24:40,950
without their parents
ever finding out.

00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,086
But in
reality,

00:24:42,086 --> 00:24:44,157
all the data is still
saved up in the cloud,

00:24:44,157 --> 00:24:46,228
where we can
eventually find it.

00:24:46,228 --> 00:24:49,067
I'm... doing a search
on the sender as we speak.

00:24:49,067 --> 00:24:50,838
RUSSELL:
So, if you're right,

00:24:50,838 --> 00:24:52,574
then this answer
key was left

00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,946
in Messner's classroom
for Turk to find.

00:24:54,946 --> 00:24:56,683
BRODY:
<i>And Messner found it first.</i>

00:24:56,683 --> 00:24:58,587
<i>Messner was a neat freak.</i>

00:24:58,587 --> 00:25:00,123
<i>If anything was out of place,</i>
<i>he would've noticed.</i>

00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,828
<i>With DMSO</i>

00:25:02,828 --> 00:25:05,267
<i>acting as a skin absorbent</i>
<i>for the cyanide...</i>

00:25:05,267 --> 00:25:09,208
<i>anybody who touched</i>
<i>that answer key was doomed.</i>

00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:15,287
Always better
to study, kids.

00:25:15,287 --> 00:25:16,991
BRODY:
Oop.

00:25:16,991 --> 00:25:18,695
Got a hit on the sender.

00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:21,734
Oh, my gosh.

00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,974
BRODY:
Nice résumé, Hannah.

00:25:24,974 --> 00:25:26,109
National Honor Roll.

00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:27,879
President of
the French Club.

00:25:27,879 --> 00:25:29,984
Literacy Volunteer
of the Year.

00:25:29,984 --> 00:25:31,754
Captain of
the swim team.

00:25:31,754 --> 00:25:32,789
Is that right?

00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:34,126
That's right.

00:25:34,126 --> 00:25:35,629
Your specialty is
the butterfly?

00:25:35,629 --> 00:25:37,599
Yeah, how'd you know?

00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:39,770
This here is, um...

00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:42,709
Mr. Messner's steroid
dosing schedule.

00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:43,879
See the code there?

00:25:44,881 --> 00:25:45,883
"B-fly"?

00:25:47,854 --> 00:25:50,893
Look, I swear, I only
took the drugs once.

00:25:50,893 --> 00:25:52,630
You'd do anything
to win, right?

00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,632
On the field,

00:25:53,632 --> 00:25:55,168
in the classroom...

00:25:55,168 --> 00:25:57,072
I looked at your e-mail.

00:25:57,072 --> 00:25:58,208
Looked like you

00:25:58,208 --> 00:25:59,711
and Turk and
a few other kids

00:25:59,711 --> 00:26:00,946
were planning on
stealing Mr. Messner's

00:26:00,946 --> 00:26:03,052
Chem IV final.

00:26:03,052 --> 00:26:04,054
That-that
was all talk.

00:26:04,054 --> 00:26:05,256
Not for Turk.

00:26:05,256 --> 00:26:06,692
And not for you.

00:26:06,692 --> 00:26:08,362
In fact, you...

00:26:08,362 --> 00:26:09,899
used it as
a murder weapon.

00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:11,334
What are you saying?

00:26:11,334 --> 00:26:13,305
The message you sent

00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,309
to lure Turk to
Mr. Messner's classroom,

00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:17,781
where you left an answer
sheet laced with cyanide.

00:26:17,781 --> 00:26:19,819
Bad luck for you,
Messner touched it first.

00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:22,758
So you scheduled
a make-up with Turk.

00:26:22,758 --> 00:26:24,161
At the pool.

00:26:24,161 --> 00:26:26,165
I didn't kill Turk.

00:26:26,165 --> 00:26:27,701
And I didn't kill Mr. Messner.

00:26:27,701 --> 00:26:29,238
Look, I didn't...
I didn't send this.

00:26:29,238 --> 00:26:30,674
It's from your account.

00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:32,644
Someone must've
hacked me.

00:26:32,644 --> 00:26:35,183
I mean, it's-it's not like
it hasn't happened before.

00:26:35,183 --> 00:26:36,887
Why would somebody
do that to you?

00:26:40,995 --> 00:26:43,801
Hannah, you have
to talk to me.

00:26:47,942 --> 00:26:50,648
You want to
know why...

00:26:50,648 --> 00:26:52,352
someone would
hack my account,

00:26:52,352 --> 00:26:53,854
and kill Turk
at the pool?

00:26:53,854 --> 00:26:55,959
Because...

00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:57,963
I am your best suspect.

00:27:00,101 --> 00:27:02,071
I wanted him dead.

00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:03,742
Why?

00:27:03,742 --> 00:27:05,378
Because of
what he...

00:27:05,378 --> 00:27:06,948
(clears throat)

00:27:06,948 --> 00:27:08,250
Because of what
he did to me.

00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:12,025
He...

00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:17,369
...a-attacked me.

00:27:23,114 --> 00:27:24,852
Why didn't
you report it?

00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:25,854
To who?

00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:27,122
The cops?

00:27:27,122 --> 00:27:29,160
What, because they're
gonna believe my word

00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,732
over Mr. Friday
Night Football?

00:27:35,707 --> 00:27:38,713
Turk was the best
class I ever took.

00:27:38,713 --> 00:27:41,151
Taught me what the
world's really like.

00:27:41,151 --> 00:27:44,157
You wouldn't understand.

00:27:44,157 --> 00:27:46,729
Just so
you know,

00:27:46,729 --> 00:27:49,802
I leave early on Thursday
nights from practice.

00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:52,708
Coach thinks
I'm at tutoring.

00:27:54,411 --> 00:27:56,415
But really I'm at
a women's shelter...

00:27:58,152 --> 00:28:00,991
...for counseling.

00:28:00,991 --> 00:28:02,127
(sniffs)

00:28:02,127 --> 00:28:03,397
I'll look into that.

00:28:03,397 --> 00:28:04,465
Go ahead.

00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:06,369
They'll tell you
I was there.

00:28:14,787 --> 00:28:17,158
ROBBINS:
QB's lungs are overinflated,

00:28:17,158 --> 00:28:18,761
heavy with fluid.

00:28:18,761 --> 00:28:20,999
Confirms drowning
was C.O.D.

00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:25,207
Jaundice and liver
damage are consistent

00:28:25,207 --> 00:28:27,211
with chronic anabolic
steroid use.

00:28:27,211 --> 00:28:29,015
All to score
a bunch of touchdowns.

00:28:29,015 --> 00:28:30,185
Well, as
expected,

00:28:30,185 --> 00:28:31,954
I found
syringe marks

00:28:31,954 --> 00:28:33,358
on this QB's
posterior.

00:28:33,358 --> 00:28:36,464
Usual target
for injecting PEDs.

00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:39,103
Right. But I can't
explain this target.

00:28:39,103 --> 00:28:41,374
Another injection site.
Why is that different?

00:28:41,374 --> 00:28:43,478
Well, it's not his
usual injection site.

00:28:43,478 --> 00:28:46,985
Needle hit
the median cubital vein.

00:28:46,985 --> 00:28:49,289
Take a look here.

00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:50,125
What's even
more unusual

00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:51,928
is this two-inch section of vein

00:28:51,928 --> 00:28:54,367
leading away
from the puncture site.

00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:55,970
It's devoid of blood.

00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,473
<i>The killer withdrew blood</i>

00:28:57,473 --> 00:28:58,842
<i>from Turk after he died.</i>

00:28:58,842 --> 00:29:01,214
<i>There was no blood pumping,</i>

00:29:01,214 --> 00:29:03,218
<i>otherwise the vein</i>
<i>would have refilled.</i>

00:29:05,122 --> 00:29:06,859
That's crazy.

00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:08,529
The median cubital
vein tells no lies.

00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:11,234
Can it tell us why somebody
took the blood of a dead man?

00:29:11,234 --> 00:29:13,205
Afraid not.

00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:19,518
Hey.

00:29:19,518 --> 00:29:23,526
So I, uh, I made
some calls, and...

00:29:23,526 --> 00:29:25,230
your story
checks out.

00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,499
About the
counseling.

00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:28,536
I'm so sorry
for what Turk

00:29:28,536 --> 00:29:29,538
did to you.

00:29:29,538 --> 00:29:31,509
You have every
right to be angry.

00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:34,115
I'm not angry.

00:29:34,115 --> 00:29:35,117
Anymore.

00:29:36,954 --> 00:29:38,958
My eyes are just open now.

00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:40,093
For what it's worth...

00:29:40,093 --> 00:29:43,567
there are far more
good people out there

00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:46,440
than there are...
Rob Turklas.

00:29:47,976 --> 00:29:50,281
Don't close your
eyes to that.

00:29:52,252 --> 00:29:55,091
STOKES:
<i>Did you hear about Turk's body?</i>

00:29:55,091 --> 00:29:55,625
RUSSELL:
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:57,930
I know these folks are
your people, okay...
(laughs)

00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,366
...but this
hocus-pocus stuff

00:29:59,366 --> 00:30:01,203
isn't sitting
well with me.

00:30:01,203 --> 00:30:02,573
Well, what are
you thinking?

00:30:02,573 --> 00:30:04,276
Well, it's not what I'm
thinking, it's what I know.

00:30:04,276 --> 00:30:06,246
I processed Turk's car
in the garage.

00:30:06,246 --> 00:30:08,351
Found a used condom
in the backseat.

00:30:08,351 --> 00:30:10,087
The DNA from
the vaginal fluid

00:30:10,087 --> 00:30:11,491
was a match to the
hair in the cauldron

00:30:11,491 --> 00:30:12,893
in Messner's shed.

00:30:12,893 --> 00:30:14,297
Well, that-that's...
that's great.

00:30:14,297 --> 00:30:15,566
That's our unknown female.

00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:18,004
I think so.

00:30:18,004 --> 00:30:20,042
So our quarterback was boffing

00:30:20,042 --> 00:30:21,611
somebody in the coven.

00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,050
Our mystery witch didn't
just leave behind her DNA.

00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:26,655
She, uh, also left her prints

00:30:26,655 --> 00:30:28,291
all over Turk's window.

00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:30,262
Well, that begs the question...

00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:31,665
which witch?

00:30:33,436 --> 00:30:34,605
This is just dandy.

00:30:34,605 --> 00:30:36,040
You actually think
I hurt Turk?

00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,042
Nonsense.

00:30:37,042 --> 00:30:39,581
Really?
Yeah.

00:30:39,581 --> 00:30:42,387
You were sleeping
with a student

00:30:42,387 --> 00:30:44,424
who's now dead.

00:30:44,424 --> 00:30:45,560
Murdered
in your school.

00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,230
I was not
sleeping with Turk.

00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,034
My gosh.
We have your
fingerprints

00:30:49,034 --> 00:30:51,606
on the inside of
his car windows

00:30:51,606 --> 00:30:55,079
and your DNA on his condom
from the backseat.

00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:57,183
Do-do I need to go on?

00:30:57,183 --> 00:30:59,956
Turk was 18.

00:30:59,956 --> 00:31:01,025
He was perfectly legal.

00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:04,098
What we had was real.

00:31:04,098 --> 00:31:05,534
Did your husband
find it real?

00:31:05,534 --> 00:31:07,171
Your marriage,
your job...

00:31:07,171 --> 00:31:08,440
you had a lot
to lose.

00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,311
Mr. Russell...

00:31:10,311 --> 00:31:12,214
every day, I play
pretend. Mm-hmm.

00:31:12,214 --> 00:31:13,483
I pretend

00:31:13,483 --> 00:31:16,089
that Pelican
sports matter.

00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:17,458
I pretend not to
resent the fact

00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,095
that I'm a failed
interior decorator.

00:31:19,095 --> 00:31:20,364
Mm-hmm.

00:31:20,364 --> 00:31:21,567
But mostly,

00:31:21,567 --> 00:31:23,638
I pretend to not know
that my husband's having

00:31:23,638 --> 00:31:25,542
a weekly tryst
with a stripper
named Tangerine.

00:31:25,542 --> 00:31:26,977
Mm-hmm.

00:31:26,977 --> 00:31:29,650
Now, I did not
kill Turk.

00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,520
But I can tell
you this...

00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,095
I would kill to bring him back.

00:31:35,095 --> 00:31:36,630
Did you know
that-that Turk's blood

00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,503
was removed from his body
after he was murdered?

00:31:39,503 --> 00:31:42,142
And that suggests

00:31:42,142 --> 00:31:43,746
a Wiccan ritual

00:31:43,746 --> 00:31:45,014
or a spell,

00:31:45,014 --> 00:31:47,285
and that suggests you.

00:31:48,522 --> 00:31:50,526
Golly.

00:31:50,526 --> 00:31:53,999
When you people secret-shovel,
you sure dig deep.

00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:55,403
The coven said that
we'd be persecuted.

00:31:55,403 --> 00:31:57,540
No, slow-slow down.

00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,677
I don't care who
or what you worship,

00:31:59,677 --> 00:32:01,181
I just care about the truth.

00:32:01,181 --> 00:32:02,683
I didn't kill Turk.

00:32:04,154 --> 00:32:06,458
You said that the killer
took Turk's blood.

00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:09,030
Yes, that's right.

00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,168
Our high priest thought
that my relationship with Turk

00:32:11,168 --> 00:32:13,205
was-was a threat to the coven.

00:32:13,205 --> 00:32:15,444
Your-your high priest?

00:32:18,316 --> 00:32:19,285
Ed.

00:32:19,285 --> 00:32:21,422
Ed, Ed Lusk?

00:32:21,422 --> 00:32:22,658
The janitor?

00:32:22,658 --> 00:32:24,161
He doesn't have power
in this life.

00:32:24,161 --> 00:32:26,299
He's determined to find power
within the coven.

00:32:26,299 --> 00:32:28,470
Turk was a threat to that power.

00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:30,006
By having sex with you,

00:32:30,006 --> 00:32:31,542
he could create a-a scandal.

00:32:31,542 --> 00:32:33,647
Ed said I was a bit...

00:32:33,647 --> 00:32:34,749
reckless.

00:32:34,749 --> 00:32:36,587
He would do anything
to protect the coven,

00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:38,691
but I'm afraid
if he took Turk's blood,

00:32:38,691 --> 00:32:40,193
that this goes
way beyond that.

00:32:40,193 --> 00:32:41,230
How so?

00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:44,803
There's an ancient power spell

00:32:44,803 --> 00:32:46,607
called "the Kratos."

00:32:46,607 --> 00:32:48,444
It uses the blood
of a sacrificed youth.

00:32:48,444 --> 00:32:49,613
It goes back to the Druids.

00:32:49,613 --> 00:32:52,585
To perform
this-this "Kratos" spell,

00:32:52,585 --> 00:32:56,460
Ed would have to take
Turk's blood to an altar,

00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,197
if-if I'm right.
Yes.

00:32:58,197 --> 00:32:59,600
The timing is very important.

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,473
The quicker the offering,
the more powerful the spell.

00:33:02,473 --> 00:33:06,213
The two attempts on Turk's life
came at the school,

00:33:06,213 --> 00:33:09,186
so maybe Ed had a-an altar
at the school?

00:33:09,186 --> 00:33:11,124
Mm-hmm.

00:33:11,124 --> 00:33:12,626
Do you know where it is?

00:33:17,102 --> 00:33:19,240
Ed Lusk hasn't been
seen since lunch.

00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,409
(school bell rings)

00:33:20,409 --> 00:33:21,544
Well,

00:33:21,544 --> 00:33:22,714
his ride's here,

00:33:22,714 --> 00:33:24,517
so he's probably
around here somewhere.

00:33:24,517 --> 00:33:26,087
(chuckles)

00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,426
SANDERS:
All we have is an altar

00:33:28,426 --> 00:33:29,795
to the cleaning gods.

00:33:29,795 --> 00:33:31,599
Not a Wiccan candle in sight.

00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:33,369
(grunts)

00:33:34,504 --> 00:33:36,809
Looks like our janitor
missed something.

00:33:36,809 --> 00:33:38,279
Directional blood drop.

00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:38,813
Maybe a drip

00:33:38,813 --> 00:33:41,118
from the needle he used
to draw Turk's blood.

00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,691
I got another one here.

00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:46,629
And here.

00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,656
(sighs)

00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:01,660
You don't belong here!

00:34:02,662 --> 00:34:04,766
LVPD.
Put down the knife.

00:34:04,766 --> 00:34:07,505
We need you to come with us, Ed.

00:34:07,505 --> 00:34:08,707
Put the knife down

00:34:08,707 --> 00:34:10,544
and no one gets hurt.

00:34:10,544 --> 00:34:11,714
We just want
to talk to you.

00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:18,828
May the blackest of darkness
smite you down into the ground.

00:34:18,828 --> 00:34:19,663
Try me.

00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,510
(knife clatters)

00:34:31,787 --> 00:34:33,591
So, Ed Lusk has lawyered up.

00:34:33,591 --> 00:34:35,462
High priest is not talking, huh?

00:34:35,462 --> 00:34:36,832
The blood drops
in his closet are.

00:34:36,832 --> 00:34:38,301
DNA matches Turk.

00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:39,503
Hope he's got a good lawyer.

00:34:39,503 --> 00:34:40,573
Yeah, really.
(rattling)

00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:43,612
Ah,

00:34:43,612 --> 00:34:44,514
my brethren.

00:34:44,514 --> 00:34:46,685
I was about to use the
foul modern text device

00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:48,856
to summon you.
What are you doing?

00:34:50,192 --> 00:34:52,497
I beseech you to enter

00:34:52,497 --> 00:34:53,899
my sacred domain.

00:34:57,206 --> 00:35:00,246
I welcome you on the day
of the Mabon Moon...

00:35:00,246 --> 00:35:01,248
David...
...whence we...

00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,450
I'm tired.

00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,487
I'm spell-casting to prove
a point.
Please.

00:35:04,487 --> 00:35:05,857
Please.

00:35:05,857 --> 00:35:07,494
Fine.

00:35:07,494 --> 00:35:09,732
I understand
that our high priest is mum,

00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,469
but his cauldron isn't.

00:35:11,469 --> 00:35:13,205
I ran the ingredients
found in it,

00:35:13,205 --> 00:35:14,341
discovered trace amounts

00:35:14,341 --> 00:35:17,347
of cherry opal gemstone.

00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,652
Wiccans believe

00:35:19,652 --> 00:35:22,591
the cherry opal amplifies
vibrational energies

00:35:22,591 --> 00:35:23,660
within the bloodstream.

00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,230
We have been assuming

00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,936
that this is a power spell,

00:35:27,936 --> 00:35:29,371
but the truth is
this soup's

00:35:29,371 --> 00:35:30,641
a healing spell.

00:35:30,641 --> 00:35:31,743
So, what are you saying?

00:35:31,743 --> 00:35:33,379
That Ed Lusk is sick?

00:35:33,379 --> 00:35:35,484
No, but someone else is.

00:35:35,484 --> 00:35:37,522
Someone who borrowed
Turk's blood

00:35:37,522 --> 00:35:40,595
and availed themselves
to Lusk's altar.

00:35:40,595 --> 00:35:43,300
As I expected,

00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,738
I found Turk's blood
in the cauldron.

00:35:45,738 --> 00:35:47,910
But unexpectedly,

00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,648
I found
a second blood contributor.

00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,387
Not Lusk,
but someone whose blood

00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:56,628
contains traces of methotrexate.

00:35:56,628 --> 00:35:59,901
That's a chemo drug used
to treat blood cancers.

00:35:59,901 --> 00:36:01,236
Thou art correct.

00:36:01,236 --> 00:36:03,942
And Henry hath
run said blood.

00:36:03,942 --> 00:36:06,848
He found a male familial match

00:36:06,848 --> 00:36:08,885
to touch DNA from
a candle recovered

00:36:08,885 --> 00:36:10,289
from Messner's altar.

00:36:10,289 --> 00:36:11,758
The match was not to Ed Lusk,

00:36:11,758 --> 00:36:12,928
but to a different

00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,932
wicked witch.

00:36:21,377 --> 00:36:22,647
Ms. Brewer?

00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:26,422
Haven't you asked my son
enough questions?

00:36:26,422 --> 00:36:26,989
Enough is enough.

00:36:26,989 --> 00:36:28,592
We asked you
to bring Mason here

00:36:28,592 --> 00:36:30,830
because we're concerned.

00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,534
Concerned?
About what will happen

00:36:32,534 --> 00:36:34,304
to him.

00:36:35,306 --> 00:36:36,943
I don't understand.

00:36:38,846 --> 00:36:41,652
You need to come with me,
Mrs. Brewer.

00:36:42,454 --> 00:36:43,757
Now.

00:36:49,535 --> 00:36:51,840
<i>We know that your son, Mason,</i>
<i>is sick, Rebecca.</i>

00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,681
That he has
Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:58,553
The blood cancer
that affects children.

00:36:58,553 --> 00:36:59,889
He missed a lot of school

00:36:59,889 --> 00:37:01,559
last semester.

00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:04,599
His grades started
to falter.

00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:07,605
We know that he was
receiving treatment,

00:37:07,605 --> 00:37:10,845
but <i>you</i> were seeking help
of a higher power.

00:37:10,845 --> 00:37:13,618
I'm not following.

00:37:13,618 --> 00:37:14,887
We found Ed Lusk's cauldron.

00:37:14,887 --> 00:37:17,492
We know that you're the one
who prepared the ritual

00:37:17,492 --> 00:37:18,795
with your son's blood.

00:37:18,795 --> 00:37:19,830
BRODY:
And Turk's.

00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:20,999
You needed it to save Mason.

00:37:20,999 --> 00:37:22,702
CRAWFORD:
You're the one who killed Turk

00:37:22,702 --> 00:37:24,005
and Messner.

00:37:24,005 --> 00:37:25,809
Your original plan
wasn't too bad.

00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:27,479
I mean, you heard the rumblings
around school

00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:30,318
that Turk was looking
for the Chem IV test answers.

00:37:30,318 --> 00:37:32,055
It's pretty easy,
setting him up.

00:37:32,055 --> 00:37:33,792
This is you

00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:36,631
entering the school
library at 1:16.

00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:39,336
That's the same day that
Chet Messner was killed.

00:37:39,336 --> 00:37:40,506
And at 1:19,

00:37:40,506 --> 00:37:41,675
you logged on to a computer

00:37:41,675 --> 00:37:44,046
using Hannah Hunt's password.

00:37:44,046 --> 00:37:45,783
You logged on to VidTree,

00:37:45,783 --> 00:37:49,424
and you sent a message
to Rob Turkla.

00:37:49,424 --> 00:37:51,094
Telling him where to find
the cheat sheet,

00:37:51,094 --> 00:37:53,499
but Messner found it instead.

00:37:53,499 --> 00:37:56,538
CRAWFORD: And so you had
to try and kill Rob again.

00:37:56,538 --> 00:37:58,108
You knew Turk's schedule.

00:37:58,108 --> 00:38:00,747
You knew where to find him.

00:38:08,363 --> 00:38:11,536
Why, Rebecca?

00:38:11,536 --> 00:38:13,406
Was Mason getting worse?

00:38:13,406 --> 00:38:15,610
Why?

00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,581
The cancer spread to his bones.

00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:19,652
The doctor found
vertical lesions

00:38:19,652 --> 00:38:21,957
and gave him six months to live.

00:38:21,957 --> 00:38:25,831
So you were running
out of time.

00:38:25,831 --> 00:38:27,401
We get it.

00:38:27,401 --> 00:38:29,873
Why does a piece of crap
like Turk

00:38:29,873 --> 00:38:30,875
get to live?

00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,044
Why does a good boy...

00:38:32,779 --> 00:38:34,449
Why does your Mason have to die?

00:38:34,449 --> 00:38:35,718
Where's the harmony in that?

00:38:35,718 --> 00:38:37,555
We searched your car.

00:38:37,555 --> 00:38:39,726
We found your Book of Shadows.

00:38:39,726 --> 00:38:43,434
Inside there was a healing
spell dedicated to Mason.

00:38:44,803 --> 00:38:46,807
The spell's materials

00:38:46,807 --> 00:38:49,579
were all the same items
that we found

00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:50,983
in Ed Lusk's cauldron.

00:38:50,983 --> 00:38:52,485
I can...

00:38:52,485 --> 00:38:54,422
Please.
Listen, I know

00:38:54,422 --> 00:38:56,059
that you love your son.

00:38:56,059 --> 00:38:57,463
No doubt.

00:38:57,463 --> 00:38:58,665
It's all right here.

00:39:01,504 --> 00:39:04,109
"If I could set
my own soul free

00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:06,714
"to save you, I would,

00:39:06,714 --> 00:39:08,485
"but I'm earthbound,

00:39:08,485 --> 00:39:10,856
"so I can call on thee, gods.

00:39:10,856 --> 00:39:15,700
Let the rising sun sear
the cold serpent of disease."

00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,869
BOTH:
"My child..."

00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,877
"...let the wind carry
your pain away."

00:39:22,881 --> 00:39:27,156
<i>"Let the waxing moon alight</i>
<i>the darkness within you."</i>

00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:31,131
And let this blood of
the powerful allow you to heal.

00:39:31,131 --> 00:39:33,102
My son, you shall be reborn.

00:39:33,102 --> 00:39:34,972
You shall be reborn.

00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:38,145
My son doesn't deserve to die.

00:39:38,145 --> 00:39:41,485
(sniffles)
I'm not an evil person.

00:39:41,485 --> 00:39:43,690
Ed told us
that they were healing spells.

00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,761
And-and medicine hadn't worked,

00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:48,500
and I was desperate
to try anything.

00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,637
Two people died because of this.

00:39:50,637 --> 00:39:52,775
The Book of Shadows
is very, very clear.

00:39:52,775 --> 00:39:56,048
It says that a spell
will only work

00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:58,186
if the sacrificed dies

00:39:58,186 --> 00:40:00,524
so that the other one can live.

00:40:02,261 --> 00:40:04,165
I had to save my boy.

00:40:05,634 --> 00:40:08,173
And you ended up
losing him anyway.

00:40:13,885 --> 00:40:15,655
Mason?

00:40:15,655 --> 00:40:16,757
I'm so sorry.

00:40:16,757 --> 00:40:17,826
Yeah.

00:40:17,826 --> 00:40:20,063
There anybody
I can call?

00:40:21,534 --> 00:40:22,769
Any family?

00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:24,640
Ever since my dad died,

00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,909
it's just been me and Mom.

00:40:25,909 --> 00:40:28,816
This is when I get dumped

00:40:28,816 --> 00:40:31,287
in an orphanage
with Oliver Twist, right?

00:40:31,287 --> 00:40:33,659
No, that's not
gonna happen.

00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:35,094
Sure.

00:40:35,094 --> 00:40:37,934
You still getting
your treatments?

00:40:37,934 --> 00:40:39,971
(sighs)
Yeah.

00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,842
I start a new round
of chemo next month.

00:40:41,842 --> 00:40:44,012
Doctors said they're gonna be
tweaking the protocols.

00:40:44,012 --> 00:40:46,585
(sighs)

00:40:46,585 --> 00:40:49,090
Think maybe things
might turn around.

00:40:52,663 --> 00:40:55,236
I'm homeless,

00:40:55,236 --> 00:40:57,006
but I'm not hopeless.

00:40:57,006 --> 00:41:00,981
HANNAH:
He can stay with my family.

00:41:02,116 --> 00:41:04,855
My parents already said
it was okay.

00:41:06,859 --> 00:41:08,263
Hannah, what...

00:41:08,263 --> 00:41:09,732
What are you doing here?

00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:13,973
I heard about your mom.

00:41:17,047 --> 00:41:18,716
I'm really sorry.

00:41:18,716 --> 00:41:20,788
Yeah, me, too.

00:41:22,157 --> 00:41:26,132
You've always been
really sweet to me,

00:41:26,132 --> 00:41:29,271
even when I was so mean to you.

00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:36,887
And I couldn't be more sorry.

00:41:38,157 --> 00:41:39,292
So...

00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:42,098
if you want to play kick the can
or something...

00:41:45,004 --> 00:41:47,008
We're not
little kids anymore, Hannah.

00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,312
I know that,

00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,016
but...

00:41:51,016 --> 00:41:53,688
what do you say?

00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,606
(laughs, sniffles)

00:42:04,076 --> 00:42:05,879
Come on, let's go.

00:42:09,654 --> 00:42:10,790
(sighs)

00:42:13,696 --> 00:42:14,931
Poor kid.

00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:18,773
How could a mother's love
get so twisted?

00:42:18,773 --> 00:42:21,912
Well, at least
Hannah stepped up.

00:42:22,681 --> 00:42:24,050
Kind of gives you hope, right?

00:42:27,624 --> 00:42:28,822
That'd be nice.
