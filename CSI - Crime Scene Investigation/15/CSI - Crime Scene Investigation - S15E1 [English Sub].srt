00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,463
CSI Finlay,

00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:31,200
I'm Sergeant Warner.

00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,271
Don't worry,
we're gonna get you out of here.

00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:34,641
We're pretty
good at this.

00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:43,193
I'm gonna stick
this through,

00:00:43,193 --> 00:00:44,797
and I want you to grab it,

00:00:44,797 --> 00:00:47,369
and aim it under your seat
towards the bottom, okay?

00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:50,710
WARNER:
You're doing great. Perfect.

00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,179
Looks like C-4.

00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:53,349
WARNER:
Yeah, the detonator

00:00:53,349 --> 00:00:55,486
is wired to the vehicle's
security system.

00:00:55,486 --> 00:00:57,625
We can't break the windows;
we can't open the doors.

00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:00,162
But if we stop the clock,
we stop the bomb.

00:01:00,162 --> 00:01:01,599
Okay, we have 13 minutes.

00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:03,838
Let's do this.
Hard drive's on its way.

00:01:03,838 --> 00:01:06,310
WARNER (over radio):
Copy that. I got it.

00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,047
FINLAY:
Let me guess, the...

00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:11,554
clock's connected
to the car's computer.

00:01:11,554 --> 00:01:14,527
We give it a new brain...
maybe I get to keep mine.

00:01:14,527 --> 00:01:16,331
That's the plan.

00:01:16,331 --> 00:01:18,403
Do me a favor, pop the hood.

00:01:18,403 --> 00:01:20,407
(phone ringing)

00:01:20,407 --> 00:01:21,676
Russell.

00:01:21,676 --> 00:01:24,081
DIGITALLY ALTERED VOICE:
Hello, Mr. Russell.

00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:27,088
I hope you understand
you only have yourself to blame

00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:28,257
for what's happening right now.

00:01:28,257 --> 00:01:30,696
Hold on a sec. Who is this?

00:01:30,696 --> 00:01:32,466
I would think
in the last three days

00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:33,735
I've made myself clear.

00:01:33,735 --> 00:01:36,107
In fact, if you answer
this simple question,

00:01:36,107 --> 00:01:38,312
you can save CSI Finlay's life.

00:01:38,312 --> 00:01:40,616
Who am I?

00:01:40,616 --> 00:01:42,487
I'm not playing this game.

00:01:42,487 --> 00:01:43,590
Wrong answer.

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,726
(line beeps)

00:01:44,726 --> 00:01:46,396
(rapid beeping)

00:01:46,396 --> 00:01:48,735
The clock's changed!
It's down to one minute!

00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:50,472
Control, we
got a problem.

00:01:50,472 --> 00:01:52,309
You need to extract. Now.

00:01:52,309 --> 00:01:54,246
Extract?
But, sir...

00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:55,883
That's an order.
Go!

00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:59,691
You did everything
that you could. Go!

00:01:59,691 --> 00:02:02,531
RUSSELL: No, no, no, no.
Why are you pulling back?

00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:04,802
What the hell are you doing? You
can't just leave her out there.

00:02:04,802 --> 00:02:06,672
There's no time.
Do something else, man!

00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:07,674
She's gonna die!

00:02:07,674 --> 00:02:09,145
She's already dead.

00:02:09,145 --> 00:02:10,414
(phone ringing)

00:02:10,414 --> 00:02:11,416
It's me. Yes?

00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:12,920
Are you ready to be reasonable?

00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,857
One last chance.

00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:18,231
CSI Finlay's life
is in your hands.

00:02:18,231 --> 00:02:19,500
Answer the question.

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,636

I feel like I'm back
in high school.

00:03:17,592 --> 00:03:19,597
You know, when we were
working together in Seattle,

00:03:19,597 --> 00:03:21,367
I didn't think
you were that into me.

00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,202
I wasn't.

00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,573
(both laugh)

00:03:24,573 --> 00:03:27,714
Detective Daniel Shaw is now...

00:03:27,714 --> 00:03:29,451
Daniel Shaw, P.I.

00:03:29,451 --> 00:03:30,586
How'd that happen?

00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:31,957
Well, <i>you</i> left the job.

00:03:31,957 --> 00:03:33,894
I was fired, remember?

00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:35,564
Yeah, by your buddy Russell.

00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:39,439
And now you're here in Las Vegas
working with him, together.

00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,875
There's got to be
a story there.

00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,011
You first.

00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:43,614
What do you mean?

00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:46,922
Well, we just happen
to run into each other in LVPD?

00:03:46,922 --> 00:03:48,759
What brings <i>you</i> to Vegas?

00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,536
Would you believe me
if I said it was you?

00:03:53,536 --> 00:03:56,009
No. You're not that good a liar.

00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:57,644
(phone chimes)

00:04:01,487 --> 00:04:03,759
Man needs you. Always has.

00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,631
You're gonna need to get
another ride back to the hotel.

00:04:09,838 --> 00:04:11,876
(camera clicking)

00:04:32,052 --> 00:04:35,460
Hey, I don't think
I was, uh...

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,996
running late.

00:04:36,996 --> 00:04:39,936
You didn't have to process
the whole crime scene yourself.

00:04:39,936 --> 00:04:41,706
I would've helped.
Where's the body?

00:04:41,706 --> 00:04:43,410
Well, that's a good question.

00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,546
(zipper closing)

00:04:44,546 --> 00:04:46,851
<i>The body's been removed.</i>

00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:49,356
Yeah, problem is,
I didn't process this.

00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:52,396
<i>Killer did.</i>

00:04:53,632 --> 00:04:55,837
I've seen this before.

00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,108
<i>We've</i> seen this before.

00:04:58,108 --> 00:04:59,578
In Seattle.

00:04:59,578 --> 00:05:00,714
What are you guys
talking about?

00:05:00,714 --> 00:05:03,487
Jared Briscoe,
the Gig Harbor Killer.

00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:07,529
He murdered seven women,
all of them college students.

00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:09,700
Last three victims,
he took the bodies,

00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,840
left processed crime scenes
for us to find.

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,110
His way of mocking us.

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,445
He was mocking me.

00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:17,851
I was the one
he wanted to laugh at.

00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,121
But you got the
last laugh, right?

00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:20,590
I mean, you caught him.
Yeah.

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,060
He's on death row.

00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,632
Just lost his last appeal.

00:05:24,632 --> 00:05:26,871
Scheduled to be
executed next week.

00:05:26,871 --> 00:05:29,643
STOKES:
So, what?

00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:30,879
You think someone's

00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,384
decided to pick up
where your boy left off?

00:05:33,384 --> 00:05:36,825
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

00:05:36,825 --> 00:05:39,097
MAN: <i>You got yourselves</i>
<i>the wrong man. I mean,</i>

00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:40,801
that's what you want me to say,
right, so that you can

00:05:40,801 --> 00:05:41,869
beat a confession out of me?

00:05:41,869 --> 00:05:43,873
It's not gonna happen.

00:05:43,873 --> 00:05:45,878
Because...

00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,018
...I <i>am</i> your man.

00:05:49,018 --> 00:05:51,457
You got me.

00:05:51,457 --> 00:05:54,496
Just like the newspapers say,
I am the Gig Harbor Killer.

00:05:54,496 --> 00:05:56,768
DETECTIVE: You sound proud
of yourself, Jared.

00:05:56,768 --> 00:05:58,639
JARED:
Proud? Nah.

00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,942
I just did what I do--
some things

00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,479
are just in your nature.
Does that include

00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:03,015
playingat being a CSI?

00:06:03,015 --> 00:06:05,120
Processing
your own crime scenes?

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,396
That was me just having a little
fun with my friend, Mr. Russell.

00:06:09,396 --> 00:06:12,001
DETECTIVE: Right down
to stalking his daughter?

00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:14,774
How is Maya?

00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,444
DETECTIVE: Those last
three girls you killed,

00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:17,947
where are their bodies?

00:06:17,947 --> 00:06:20,185
JARED: 'Cause the families
want closure, right?

00:06:20,185 --> 00:06:23,959
But... this ain't the movies.

00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:27,167
And, trust me, they do not
want to see them now.

00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:30,074
But maybe someone else does.

00:06:32,646 --> 00:06:36,019
(whispers):
Is that what you want?

00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:40,095
Reliving the past?

00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,967
Unfortunately.

00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:44,805
Well, unfortunately,
I just got a call

00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,976
from the Washington State
Department of Corrections.

00:06:46,976 --> 00:06:49,682
Apparently, you're
still loved up there,

00:06:49,682 --> 00:06:51,519
enough to pull strings
to get Jared Briscoe

00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,956
transferred down here
for an interview?

00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:54,926
I didn't mean
to go around you, Conrad.

00:06:54,926 --> 00:06:57,098
No, you didn't.
You just ran right over me.

00:06:57,098 --> 00:06:58,969
You're pissed. I'm sorry.

00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:00,506
No, it's more than
that-- I'm worried.

00:07:00,506 --> 00:07:02,810
You're supposed to be the
cool head around here.

00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,547
That's why I hired you.

00:07:04,547 --> 00:07:06,685
Conrad, I need to talk
to Briscoe face-to-face

00:07:06,685 --> 00:07:09,057
so I can understand
what's going on here in Vegas.

00:07:09,057 --> 00:07:11,128
You mean a copycat.

00:07:11,128 --> 00:07:12,899
Yeah, I do.

00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,471
All right, D.B.,

00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:18,177
look, I know what
happened in Seattle.

00:07:18,177 --> 00:07:21,082
I know Briscoe started to follow
his exploits in the news,

00:07:21,082 --> 00:07:23,722
started to focus on you,
the lead investigator,

00:07:23,722 --> 00:07:25,560
even to the point
where he stalked Maya.

00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,062
Yeah, and that was a mistake.

00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:28,866
Well, don't make
one of your own

00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,069
by opening up old wounds.

00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:32,708
I already lost one friend
to ghosts of the past;

00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,145
I don't need to lose another.

00:07:35,882 --> 00:07:37,284
How is Jim?

00:07:37,284 --> 00:07:40,023
Ellie Brass is facing a fight.

00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:43,699
I don't think
either of them can win, but...

00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:46,103
he says he's not
gonna leave her.

00:07:46,103 --> 00:07:48,709
Even if that means leaving us.

00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:53,686
I need to do this.

00:07:55,925 --> 00:07:57,929
(camera clicking)

00:08:00,301 --> 00:08:01,871
Wow.

00:08:01,871 --> 00:08:04,242
Certainly lives
up to billing.

00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:05,779
Uh-huh.

00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:08,920
I saw Finn outside; she said
you could use a hand here.

00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,992
I haven't had a chance to work
any of the blood pools yet.

00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,331
Oh, well, I'm on it.

00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:17,838
You know, this guy really
did our jobs for us.

00:08:17,838 --> 00:08:20,210
He marked
all the evidence.

00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,252
Including the murder weapon,
a fisherman's gaff.

00:08:24,252 --> 00:08:25,855
You don't see <i>that</i> much.

00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,326
Yeah, especially not
in the desert.

00:08:27,326 --> 00:08:30,198
Even dusted it for fingerprints.

00:08:30,198 --> 00:08:32,103
Killer leave us one?
(chuckles)

00:08:32,103 --> 00:08:33,940
No, ma'am.
You know,

00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,078
Finn's right-- based
on the volume of blood

00:08:36,078 --> 00:08:38,249
and this arterial spray,

00:08:38,249 --> 00:08:40,087
our missing victim
definitely died here.

00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:48,605
Sara.

00:08:48,605 --> 00:08:50,074
Yeah?

00:08:51,811 --> 00:08:53,682
Digital recorder?

00:08:53,682 --> 00:08:54,918
Yeah, just like the ones we use.

00:08:54,918 --> 00:08:56,956
Dusted it for prints, as well.

00:08:56,956 --> 00:08:59,228
Hit "play."

00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:02,234
DIGITALLY ALTERED VOICE:
I'm standing facing south.

00:09:02,234 --> 00:09:04,706
Spatter indicates castoff
consistent

My point is...

00:19:22,102 --> 00:19:26,111
maybe that guy didn't
swallow my finger.

00:19:57,879 --> 00:20:00,050
Yes, it is. So much, in fact,
that it's pointed out

00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,656
something that's just
not adding up for me.

00:20:02,656 --> 00:20:04,526
What's that?

00:20:04,526 --> 00:20:05,896
Well, I reconstructed

00:20:05,896 --> 00:20:08,602

on the blood at the scene.

00:20:08,602 --> 00:20:11,608
Everything's consistent,

00:20:15,617 --> 00:20:17,689
to the south there.

00:20:17,689 --> 00:20:19,493
They just don't match up
with the murder at all.

00:20:19,493 --> 00:20:21,697
You think
that blood was planted?

00:20:21,697 --> 00:20:23,100
Yes, I do.

00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,837
And the fact
that he strung it

00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:26,508
tells me it must mean something.

00:20:26,508 --> 00:20:27,743
How so?

00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:29,747
Well, Russell mentioned
that the Gig Harbor Killer

00:20:29,747 --> 00:20:32,019
used to get off
on-on taunting them.

00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:33,656
Yeah, I heard

00:20:33,656 --> 00:20:36,462
at the last scene, he scrawled
Russell's daughter's name

00:20:36,462 --> 00:20:38,399
on the walls and ceiling.

00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:40,471
I didn't know that.

00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:42,943
After Russell left the, uh,
"processed" crime scene,

00:20:42,943 --> 00:20:45,782
he called Seattle P.D. and
requested a protective detail

00:20:45,782 --> 00:20:47,084
for Maya and her family.

00:20:47,084 --> 00:20:48,621
(exhales)

00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:53,199
Well, if we're looking
at a copycat killer here,

00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:56,538
then he may be leaving
some messages

00:20:56,538 --> 00:20:58,610
of his own.

00:21:01,816 --> 00:21:03,821
Hey.

00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:06,994
Any word on Keri?

00:21:06,994 --> 00:21:10,669
No. No, not yet.

00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,542
See you got your visitor's badge
validated for another day.

00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:15,546
Does that go with
the hundred dollars

00:21:15,546 --> 00:21:16,682
you gave Dispatch?

00:21:16,682 --> 00:21:17,918
Along with coffee privileges.

00:21:17,918 --> 00:21:19,855
Oh, help yourself.

00:21:19,855 --> 00:21:22,729
You know, I didn't think

00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:24,699
that we got off
on the wrong foot.

00:21:24,699 --> 00:21:27,572
Sex does not
buy you a free pass.

00:21:28,607 --> 00:21:29,977
You lied to me.

00:21:29,977 --> 00:21:31,881
Sin of omission.

00:21:31,881 --> 00:21:34,553
Besides, you lied to me, too.

00:21:34,553 --> 00:21:36,659
Prison visitor logs,
Washington State.

00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,128
You didn't tell me
that the guy Keri met

00:21:38,128 --> 00:21:39,798
at that coffee house
might be a killer.

00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,836
More than that--
Gig Harbor copycat.

00:21:41,836 --> 00:21:43,172
Sin of omission.

00:21:43,172 --> 00:21:46,046
Look, we all worked
the Gig Harbor case.

00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:48,785
You, Russell, me.

00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:50,522
Even Keri.

00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:52,960
If you let me in, I can help.

00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:57,503
Keri's my partner.
I need to help.

00:21:57,503 --> 00:21:59,007
So can we...

00:21:59,007 --> 00:22:01,746
get back on the right foot?

00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:04,285
We can try.

00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:10,598
Uh, P.D.

00:22:10,598 --> 00:22:12,302
found Keri Torres's car.

00:22:12,302 --> 00:22:14,172
Sara's processing it now.

00:22:21,287 --> 00:22:23,058
Talk about clean.

00:22:23,058 --> 00:22:25,663
Yeah.

00:22:25,663 --> 00:22:27,167
Um, I'm sorry,
have you two met?

00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:29,806
Oh, yeah, we have.
Yeah, P.I. Shaw

00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,978
is the one who's been
drinking all our coffee,

00:22:31,978 --> 00:22:33,882
and "clean" is an
understatement.

00:22:33,882 --> 00:22:35,685
The car was washed
and detailed.

00:22:35,685 --> 00:22:37,589
No prints, no trace.

00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:39,160
There's not a speck of dust.
Wow.

00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,328
Even the inside?

00:22:40,328 --> 00:22:42,834
Yeah, I fumed--
not a single print.

00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:44,204
But you do need
to see this.

00:22:51,186 --> 00:22:52,621
Whoa.

00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,325
What the hell?

00:22:54,325 --> 00:22:56,597
FINLAY: Looks like
high velocity spatter.

00:22:56,597 --> 00:22:57,934
SIDLE: Yeah, that's what
I thought at first, too.

00:22:57,934 --> 00:23:01,240
But there's no other blood
event in the car, and...

00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,579
the pattern doesn't
make any sense.

00:23:03,579 --> 00:23:06,586
It's like someone placed the
blood drops deliberately.

00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:08,088
So why go
to all that trouble?

00:23:08,088 --> 00:23:09,959
I don't know the
answer to that yet,

00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:11,830
but I do think
it had something to do

00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,966
with the Gig Harbor Killer.

00:23:12,966 --> 00:23:14,703
Why do you think that?

00:23:14,703 --> 00:23:18,043
Because Keri Torres
thought it before me.

00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:21,851
Whoever wanted us
to find the blood

00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:23,755
wanted us to find
these, too.

00:23:23,755 --> 00:23:25,627
This is Keri's notebook.
And case files.

00:23:25,627 --> 00:23:27,029
They were all
in the trunk.

00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:29,134
You know, we were all thinking
that Keri was here investigating

00:23:29,134 --> 00:23:30,838
the death of
Emily Bartson,

00:23:30,838 --> 00:23:32,374
but most of these
files are related

00:23:32,374 --> 00:23:34,245
to the Gig
Harbor Killer.
Well, like you said,

00:23:34,245 --> 00:23:36,650
she did work that case.
According to this,

00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,086
she's finding
similarities between

00:23:38,086 --> 00:23:40,392
the Gig Harbor victims
and Emily Bartson.

00:23:40,392 --> 00:23:42,729
She does fit the profile--
blonde, college student,

00:23:42,729 --> 00:23:44,033
part-time escort.
Seems like

00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:46,638
Keri was already onto the idea
of a Gig Harbor copycat.

00:23:46,638 --> 00:23:47,874
And we know she was

00:23:47,874 --> 00:23:50,146
on the trail of a client
here in Vegas

00:23:50,146 --> 00:23:51,415
who hired Emily for the weekend.

00:23:51,415 --> 00:23:54,288
A client who
may be the murderer,

00:23:54,288 --> 00:23:56,727
not only of Emily Bartson,
but also Keri.

00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:58,731
Did you find something?
Keri scribbled in
an appointment.

00:23:58,731 --> 00:24:01,637

You know who he is?

Yeah, thanks to
Washington State prison logs.

00:24:16,035 --> 00:24:17,705
He's a local
guy who just

00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:19,809
happened to have visited
Jared Briscoe

00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:22,716
five or six times
in the past year.

00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,737
I'm sorry, you can't
just walk in here.

00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,408
This badge says

You lost?

Mark Turner?

00:24:45,265 --> 00:24:46,801
That's right.
LVPD.

00:24:46,801 --> 00:24:48,237
We need to ask you
some questions.

00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,443
Leave us.

00:24:56,221 --> 00:24:57,758
What's this about?

00:24:57,758 --> 00:24:59,261
It's about Emily Bartson.

00:24:59,261 --> 00:25:00,397
Never heard of her.

00:25:00,397 --> 00:25:01,834
What about Keri Torres?

00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,236
Who?

00:25:03,236 --> 00:25:06,210
You met her at Nell's Street
Coffee House on Monday.

00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,147
That isn't me.

00:25:08,147 --> 00:25:10,284
I was in D.C. on Monday.
Can you prove that?

00:25:10,284 --> 00:25:11,488
Certainly can.

00:25:11,488 --> 00:25:13,492
As general counsel for
Winthrop International,

00:25:13,492 --> 00:25:15,930
my travels are
carefully documented.

00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:19,071
Same as your visits
to the Washington State prison.

00:25:19,071 --> 00:25:20,741
Unless you're gonna tell us

00:25:20,741 --> 00:25:23,246
that you don't know
who Jared Briscoe is, either.

00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:27,823
I am acquainted
with Mr. Briscoe.

00:25:27,823 --> 00:25:31,364
However, my dealings with him
are privileged information.

00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:32,533
Privileged how?

00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:36,508
If you must know, I have
been enlisted to defend

00:25:36,508 --> 00:25:39,381
a man who has been
wrongfully imprisoned.

00:25:39,381 --> 00:25:40,951
Wrongfully imprisoned?

00:25:40,951 --> 00:25:42,287
Says who?

00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:44,258
MAN:
Says me.

00:25:54,914 --> 00:25:56,050
I know how you feel.

00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,887
The same way I felt
when I first discovered

00:25:57,887 --> 00:25:59,257
my brother on the news.

00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,429
A serial killer, a sadist,
sentenced to death,

00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:02,898
they said.

00:26:02,898 --> 00:26:05,872
I didn't know him,
yet the face I saw was mine.

00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:09,446
So you and
Jared Briscoe...

00:26:09,446 --> 00:26:11,016
We were adopted at birth.

00:26:11,016 --> 00:26:12,853
And raised in different worlds.

00:26:12,853 --> 00:26:14,423
We never knew
of each other.

00:26:14,423 --> 00:26:15,859
Never met.

00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:17,196
We still haven't.

00:26:17,196 --> 00:26:19,166
The support I've been
lending Jared

00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:20,536
is anonymous,
carried out through

00:26:20,536 --> 00:26:22,474
my emissary, Mr. Turner.
I don't believe this.

00:26:22,474 --> 00:26:24,044
Mr. Winthrop,
why don't you let me...

00:26:24,044 --> 00:26:25,246
Give us the room, please.

00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:28,152
I apologize for
my rudeness.

00:26:28,152 --> 00:26:30,291
We haven't met either.
I'm Paul Winthrop.

00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:31,593
And you are?
We're investigating

00:26:31,593 --> 00:26:33,932
the murder of a college
student, Emily Bartson.

00:26:33,932 --> 00:26:35,969
And the disappearance of an
investigator sent to find her,

00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,840
my partner, Keri Torres.
And you think

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,880
my general counsel, Mr. Turner,
is somehow involved?

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,085
The evidence suggests he was the
last person to see her alive.

00:26:43,085 --> 00:26:45,891
Whatever your evidence is,

00:26:45,891 --> 00:26:48,363
I can vouch for
Mr. Turner's character.

00:26:48,363 --> 00:26:50,133
He wouldn't harm anyone.

00:26:54,108 --> 00:26:56,046
What about you?

00:26:56,046 --> 00:26:57,449
Maybe that's you

Dead co-eds, missing
women, the police

in the wrong places,

00:27:07,971 --> 00:27:09,308
accusing the innocent.

00:27:09,308 --> 00:27:10,610
Jared Briscoe is not innocent.

00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,615
Jared is a victim.

00:27:12,615 --> 00:27:14,352
First of fate.

00:27:14,352 --> 00:27:17,091
Two boys abandoned--
one finds a loving home,

the other is consigned
to hell in foster care.

00:27:20,232 --> 00:27:23,405
But Jared is not the depraved
killer you say he is.

00:27:23,405 --> 00:27:26,278
Your brother confessed
to the murder of seven women.

00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:29,151
And it is that confession alone
that keeps him on death row.

00:27:29,151 --> 00:27:33,059
As Jared's twin, I was
prepared to submit my DNA.

00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:35,531
But then I was told that my
DNA wouldn't help because,

00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:39,005
to my surprise, Jared
was not convicted on DNA.

00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:40,308
In fact, I
was told that

00:27:40,308 --> 00:27:44,016
the killer's DNA
was never found.

00:27:44,016 --> 00:27:46,053
We didn't need it.

00:27:46,053 --> 00:27:48,125
There was plenty of evidence
on Jared's boat.

00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,561
Circumstantial evidence.

00:27:49,561 --> 00:27:51,399

weak-minded obsession

00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:53,136

Maya Russell, yes, I know.

I saw her photo in the

Whatever you believe,
Mr. Winthrop,

00:28:03,457 --> 00:28:05,596
your brother was
convicted by a jury.

00:28:05,596 --> 00:28:07,566
Four appeals have failed
to change that.

00:28:07,566 --> 00:28:09,337
Mere proof that the
system protects itself.

00:28:09,337 --> 00:28:11,675
Because you
wouldn't be here

00:28:11,675 --> 00:28:13,546

weren't still out there.

00:28:13,546 --> 00:28:15,718
Well, maybe you're right.

00:28:15,718 --> 00:28:17,555
Or half right.

Or maybe it's you, Ms. Finlay,
who needs to be right.

00:28:22,498 --> 00:28:24,637
We both know why.

we missed something.

00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:06,761
Briscoe had a partner.

00:29:06,761 --> 00:29:09,199
You think the brothers
were working together.

00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:11,571
I think they still are.
Okay, look, guys,

00:29:11,571 --> 00:29:14,410
I'll admit the situation
is highly unusual.

00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,649
But Paul Winthrop has
an unblemished record.

00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:19,454
Man was a pillar of the
community in San Diego,

00:29:19,454 --> 00:29:21,025
where he built
a real estate empire.

00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:23,563
Same's true in Vegas since
he moved here last year.

00:29:23,563 --> 00:29:25,634
Take advantage
of the soft real estate. Yes.

00:29:25,634 --> 00:29:27,204
I read that
article, Conrad.

00:29:27,204 --> 00:29:28,641
I just have a different
point of view.

00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,380
Okay? I say that
Winthrop moved here

00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,616
because you
and I are here.

00:29:32,616 --> 00:29:33,786
And he's got a plan

00:29:33,786 --> 00:29:36,224
to spring his brother,
so that they can go on

00:29:36,224 --> 00:29:38,262
another spree, to mock us.

00:29:38,262 --> 00:29:39,632
I already warned one person
in this room

00:29:39,632 --> 00:29:40,667
about making this personal.

00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:42,538
And given history,
I'm giving you

00:29:42,538 --> 00:29:44,041
the same warning.

00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:46,245
For all we know,
Winthrop is on the level.

00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:48,384
And the murder of Emily Bartson,
here in Las Vegas,

00:29:48,384 --> 00:29:49,653
with the same M.O.?

00:29:49,653 --> 00:29:51,490
ECKLIE: Could be a copycat,
or maybe you didn't

00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,660
get the right guy
and Jared Briscoe

00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,162
is just what his brother
says he is:

00:29:54,162 --> 00:29:56,801
a deluded patsy who took the
fall for the real killer.

00:29:56,801 --> 00:29:58,171
You're being awfully quiet.

00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,775
I'm thinking.

00:29:59,775 --> 00:30:01,679
I have to say,

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,651
being in the room with Briscoe,
this time was different.

00:30:04,651 --> 00:30:06,823
You know, maybe it was me.
Maybe...

00:30:06,823 --> 00:30:10,164
five years has given me
some perspective.

00:30:10,164 --> 00:30:13,471
Obviously, he believes
that he's the Gig Harbor Killer,

00:30:13,471 --> 00:30:15,409
and it's the only thing
that gives his unremarkable life

00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:16,845
any meaning
at this point, but...

00:30:16,845 --> 00:30:19,283
So you're telling me that
you think he's innocent?

00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:21,388
No, I'm not saying that.
I'm saying that maybe--

00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:22,724
just maybe--
he wasn't the mastermind.

00:30:22,724 --> 00:30:23,827
We're saying...
(knocking)

00:30:23,827 --> 00:30:25,363
Sorry, I don't want
to interrupt,

00:30:25,363 --> 00:30:28,303
but Henry ran DNA on
the evidence markers

00:30:28,303 --> 00:30:30,207
and the trajectory strings
that the killer

00:30:30,207 --> 00:30:31,744
fashioned out of human tissue.

00:30:31,744 --> 00:30:33,614
Results are back.

00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:37,322
DNA is a match to
Belinda Forster,

00:30:37,322 --> 00:30:40,296
Nicole Davis and
Grace Duncamp.

00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,500
Those are
the Gig Harbor Killer's

00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,605
last three victims in Seattle.

00:30:45,474 --> 00:30:47,611
The three women we never found.

00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:51,553
♪ ♪

00:31:08,489 --> 00:31:11,496
♪ ♪

00:31:24,256 --> 00:31:25,660
Hey.

00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,932
So you probably
already heard by now,

00:31:27,932 --> 00:31:29,735
<i>The Shining</i> has nothing
on our current case

00:31:29,735 --> 00:31:30,904
when it comes to twins.

00:31:30,904 --> 00:31:32,341
Yeah, I did hear that.

00:31:32,341 --> 00:31:34,512
Well, in light
of recent events,

00:31:34,512 --> 00:31:36,382
I think I may have
found something.

00:31:36,382 --> 00:31:38,287
That is,
unless I'm crazy.

00:31:38,287 --> 00:31:40,425
So, Sara found
this blood pattern

00:31:40,425 --> 00:31:42,763
in the headliner of
Keri Torres's car.

00:31:42,763 --> 00:31:44,267
What, do you think
it's a message?

00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:46,504
Well, I kept
looking at it

00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,275
and thinking that
I've seen this before.

00:31:48,275 --> 00:31:49,310
Huh?

00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,816
That pattern is
a constellation.

00:31:51,816 --> 00:31:54,288
Gemini.

00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:55,558
The twins.

00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,430
You think I'm crazy?

00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,699
No crazier than I am,

00:31:59,699 --> 00:32:02,439
because I think I tripped
over the same thing.

00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:04,243
Well, you remember
those castoff patterns

00:32:04,243 --> 00:32:05,579
I said didn't make any sense?

00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:07,583
Yeah, but were still
strung by the killer.

00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:08,853
Right. Watch the monitor.

00:32:10,289 --> 00:32:13,664
Keep your eye
on the green strings, okay?

00:32:16,836 --> 00:32:18,540
Gemini.

00:32:19,943 --> 00:32:21,681
Well, I may have found

00:32:21,681 --> 00:32:23,217
something even
more than that.

00:32:23,217 --> 00:32:24,486
The, uh, warehouse

00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:26,825
where our killer left us
the processed crime scene

00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:29,564
used to house a building
and supply company called

00:32:29,564 --> 00:32:31,401
Castor Novelties, Inc.

00:32:31,401 --> 00:32:32,470
Castor?

00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:34,842
As in Castor and Pollux?
Yeah.

00:32:34,842 --> 00:32:37,281
And the same company used
to own a chemical plant,

00:32:37,281 --> 00:32:39,351
Pollux Petroleum,

00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:40,888
off Highway 178.
I found the address

00:32:40,888 --> 00:32:42,625
in Keri Torres's notebook.

00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:44,696
It looked like she was
planning a visit there.

00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,634
All right, I'll get over there
and look into it.

00:33:00,965 --> 00:33:02,969
Son of a bitch.

00:33:02,969 --> 00:33:05,776
I know. Just when you think this
guy couldn't outdo his last one,

00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:07,311
he goes and does
something like this.

00:33:07,311 --> 00:33:09,583
Full-on mass
grave excavation

00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:12,389
complete with
strings and markers.

00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:15,363
Crazy fool even set up
a field morgue this time.

00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:19,037
I need to see the bodies.

00:33:21,074 --> 00:33:24,683
STOKES: He laid them all out
just like a doctor would.

00:33:24,683 --> 00:33:27,656
Female and mummified,
so we're definitely not looking

00:33:27,656 --> 00:33:29,928
at Emily Bartson
or Keri Torres here.

00:33:29,928 --> 00:33:31,731
No.

00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:34,537
They've been buried
too long for that.

00:33:34,537 --> 00:33:36,541
And not even
in this ground.

00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:38,011
I mean, you can eyeball it
and see that soil trace

00:33:38,011 --> 00:33:39,748
is nothing like
desert caliche.

00:33:39,748 --> 00:33:42,889
Yeah, the whole excavation
has been staged,

00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:44,759
just like everything else.
Yes, sir.

00:33:47,699 --> 00:33:50,438
"Rainier Valley College."

00:33:50,438 --> 00:33:51,808
Class ring.

00:33:51,808 --> 00:33:53,345
Nicole Davis went there.

00:33:53,345 --> 00:33:54,580
Okay, well,

00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,453
Super Dave and the doc
are en route as we speak.

00:33:57,453 --> 00:33:58,489
We'll collect
some DNA...

00:33:58,489 --> 00:34:00,493
I don't need DNA
to tell me who they are.

00:34:01,862 --> 00:34:04,602
I know these girls.

00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:10,916
(camera clicking)

00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,762
Find anything, Doc?

00:34:32,762 --> 00:34:36,003
Well, based on
preliminary observation,

00:34:36,003 --> 00:34:39,877
all the victims exhibit
blunt force trauma to the head

00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:43,820
and multiple sharp force
injuries to the torso.

00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,924
Beaten and stabbed,
just like all the others.

00:34:45,924 --> 00:34:47,394
Well, the type
of weapon

00:34:47,394 --> 00:34:49,966
is consistent
with a fisherman's gaff.

00:34:49,966 --> 00:34:52,739
He also performed
his own Y-incision.

00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:54,175
Seems to have
removed the organs.

00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,912
That's what he used

00:34:55,912 --> 00:34:58,818
to make the trajectory strings
and the markers.

00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:05,466
Five years, we found nothing.

00:35:05,466 --> 00:35:07,537
Families had to go
without answers.

00:35:07,537 --> 00:35:11,111
So now he just gives them back
just like that.

00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:12,782
So what do you
think it means?

00:35:12,782 --> 00:35:16,624
Maybe he's telling us
he's closing the book on Seattle

00:35:16,624 --> 00:35:18,928
and opening it on Vegas.

00:35:18,928 --> 00:35:22,035
So, I collected DNA
to confirm I.D.,

00:35:22,035 --> 00:35:24,774
but I think I may have
found something else.

00:35:24,774 --> 00:35:26,078
One of the victim's nails
suggests

00:35:26,078 --> 00:35:27,815
that she may have fought
her attacker.

00:35:27,815 --> 00:35:29,952
Did she get
a piece of him?

00:35:29,952 --> 00:35:32,224
Oh, yeah.
Big piece.

00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,161
She bit him, too.

00:35:34,161 --> 00:35:35,932
I found skin and hair
between her teeth.

00:35:35,932 --> 00:35:37,135
ROBBINS:
Five years,

00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,807
so he probably assumed
the evidence wouldn't survive.

00:35:39,807 --> 00:35:40,976
Well, let's hope he's wrong.

00:35:40,976 --> 00:35:42,913
David, why don't you
get that over to Nick.

00:35:42,913 --> 00:35:44,684
He can run the sample
through RapidHit.

00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,221
Yeah.

00:35:47,223 --> 00:35:49,026
Hey.
Hey.

00:35:49,026 --> 00:35:50,530
I heard they
found bodies.

00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:52,534
Yeah, not Keri,
not Emily Bartson.

00:35:52,534 --> 00:35:53,971
Bodies were
the last three victims

00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:55,608
of the Gig Harbor Killer.

00:35:55,608 --> 00:35:57,178
You got to be
kidding me.
I know.

00:35:57,178 --> 00:35:59,582
Who knew that psychopath
Briscoe had a twin.

00:35:59,582 --> 00:36:01,854
Yeah. Who may be even more
of a psychopath.

00:36:01,854 --> 00:36:03,558
Trick will be proving it.

00:36:03,558 --> 00:36:06,497
I think we bring in Winthrop
and we lean on him.

00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,736
Yeah, that's where
I'm going right now.
Not without me.

00:36:08,736 --> 00:36:11,141
Sorry. Can't come with me
on this one.

00:36:11,141 --> 00:36:13,112
You're out
of your jurisdiction.
Finn, come on.

00:36:13,112 --> 00:36:14,582
When have you ever known me

00:36:14,582 --> 00:36:16,553
not to be able
to take care of myself?

00:36:20,127 --> 00:36:21,997
(car alarm chirps)

00:36:34,925 --> 00:36:36,863
(rapid beeping)

00:36:39,636 --> 00:36:41,172
(beeping)

00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:46,551
Hi.

00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:48,053
Confirmed I.D. on the victims.

00:36:48,053 --> 00:36:49,624
Yeah, what about
David's samples?

00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,629
Yeah, running it right now.

00:36:51,629 --> 00:36:53,031
You know, Briscoe's brother was

00:36:53,031 --> 00:36:54,801
so willing
to give up his DNA.

00:36:54,801 --> 00:36:57,040
I wonder how eager
he's gonna be after this result.

00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,175
Forget reasonable doubt.

00:36:58,175 --> 00:37:00,881
Yeah, I say we get two for one.

00:37:00,881 --> 00:37:02,084
(computer beeping)

00:37:02,084 --> 00:37:03,320
What?

00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,092
What do you got?

00:37:06,092 --> 00:37:07,896
Ah, damn it.
All right, all right.

00:37:07,896 --> 00:37:08,932
(phone ringing)

00:37:08,932 --> 00:37:10,803
Take those samples
back to the lab.

00:37:10,803 --> 00:37:13,041
Have Henry rerun
them, will you?

00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:15,646
Yeah. Russell.

00:37:15,646 --> 00:37:18,352
When?

00:37:18,352 --> 00:37:19,922
(tires screech)

00:37:19,922 --> 00:37:22,161
(sirens wailing)

00:37:26,169 --> 00:37:27,572
How long?

00:37:27,572 --> 00:37:28,842
15 minutes. My guys are on it.

00:37:28,842 --> 00:37:30,679
(phone ringing)

00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:32,182
Russell.

00:37:32,182 --> 00:37:34,187
DIGITALLY ALTERED VOICE:
Hello, Mr. Russell.

00:37:34,187 --> 00:37:37,193
I hope you understand,
you only have yourself to blame

00:37:37,193 --> 00:37:38,596
for what's happening right now.

00:37:38,596 --> 00:37:40,600
Hold on a second. Who is this?

00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,705
I would think
in the last three days,

00:37:42,705 --> 00:37:44,041
I've made myself clear.

00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:46,213
In fact, if you answer
this simple question,

00:37:46,213 --> 00:37:48,384
you can save CSI Finlay's life.

00:37:48,384 --> 00:37:50,922
Who am I?

00:37:50,922 --> 00:37:52,760
No, I'm not playing this game.

00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,996
Wrong answer.

00:37:53,996 --> 00:37:55,599
(line beeps)

00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,102
(rapid beeping)

00:37:57,102 --> 00:37:59,374
Clock's changed!
It's down to one minute!

00:37:59,374 --> 00:38:00,810
Control, we got a problem.

00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,648
HURST:
You need to extract. Now.

00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:03,850
Extract? Sir...

00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:04,852
That's an order!
Whoa, whoa.

00:38:04,852 --> 00:38:06,356
What the hell are you doing?!

00:38:06,356 --> 00:38:08,226
You can't just
leave her out there.
HURST: There's no time.

00:38:08,226 --> 00:38:10,264
Do something else, man.
She's gonna die.

00:38:10,264 --> 00:38:11,734
She's already dead.

00:38:11,734 --> 00:38:12,736
(phone ringing)

00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,939
It's me. Yes.

00:38:13,939 --> 00:38:16,177
DIGITALLY ALTERED VOICE:
Are you ready to be reasonable?

00:38:16,177 --> 00:38:17,179
One last chance.

00:38:17,179 --> 00:38:19,017
CSI Finlay's life

00:38:19,017 --> 00:38:20,352
is in your hands.

00:38:20,352 --> 00:38:22,991
Answer the question.

00:38:22,991 --> 00:38:24,695
Who am I?

00:38:24,695 --> 00:38:26,934
All right, all right,
I'll give you what you want.

00:38:26,934 --> 00:38:28,269
Yes, I know who you are.

00:38:28,269 --> 00:38:29,773
You're the Gig Harbor Killer.

00:38:29,773 --> 00:38:31,143
(rapid beeping)

00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:33,214
That wasn't so hard,
now, was it?

00:38:34,249 --> 00:38:36,387
(rapid beeping)

00:38:37,188 --> 00:38:38,291
(gasps)

00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:39,360
We're clear!
Go get her!

00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,364
Now! Now! Go!

00:38:41,364 --> 00:38:42,934
(officers shouting)

00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:46,408
It's all right. Come on.
You're gonna be all right.

00:38:53,691 --> 00:38:57,165
ECKLIE: <i>You do know what this is</i>
<i>going to do to your career?</i>

00:38:57,165 --> 00:38:58,903
Yeah, what choice
did I have, Conrad?

00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,907
You want me to let Finlay
just die?

00:39:00,907 --> 00:39:02,310
That's not what
I'm talking about.

00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,445
Jared Briscoe's defense

00:39:03,445 --> 00:39:05,316
has already filed a writ
of habeas corpus.

00:39:05,316 --> 00:39:07,020
They're going to haul you
into court...

00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,990
I know that. I know.
They're gonna rehash

00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,962
everything that happened
in Seattle.

00:39:10,962 --> 00:39:12,933
They're gonna say
that I went after Briscoe

00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,469
'cause he went
after my daughter.

00:39:14,469 --> 00:39:17,342
That I built the entire case
on circumstantial evidence.

00:39:17,342 --> 00:39:18,779
I know all that.
That's right.

00:39:18,779 --> 00:39:19,948
They're gonna question
your motives there.

00:39:19,948 --> 00:39:20,983
They'll question
your motives here.

00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,255
Yeah, just like you did.

00:39:23,255 --> 00:39:25,994
Not to mention
this new DNA evidence.

00:39:25,994 --> 00:39:28,366
Yeah, which didn't come back
to Briscoe or his twin,

00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,305
but to an unknown male,
who probably is the real killer.

00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:34,211
Maybe. Maybe not.

00:39:34,211 --> 00:39:36,783
You still think
the twins are behind this?

00:39:36,783 --> 00:39:38,020
Yes, I do.
So, what--

00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,957
the DNA was planted,
another part of the game?

00:39:39,957 --> 00:39:41,361
Catch me if you can?
Yeah, that's right.

00:39:41,361 --> 00:39:42,830
And if they're not?

00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:45,970
If the DNA is right,
and you put the wrong man--

00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,807
an innocent man--
on death row?

00:39:47,807 --> 00:39:49,511
Then I will find
the right man, Conrad,

00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:51,248
and I will just have to live

00:39:51,248 --> 00:39:52,852
with the rest of it.

00:39:52,852 --> 00:39:55,924
You're not the only one who'll
have to live with it, D.B.

00:39:55,924 --> 00:39:57,228
This lab will.

00:40:00,402 --> 00:40:02,406
You want me to resign?
No.

00:40:02,406 --> 00:40:04,878
I don't want you to resign.
I want you to fix this.

00:40:04,878 --> 00:40:06,915
If Briscoe and
his brother

00:40:06,915 --> 00:40:08,419
really are the ones
behind these murders...

00:40:09,955 --> 00:40:11,993
...catch 'em.
