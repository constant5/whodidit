00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:07,574
(siren wailing,
men arguing indistinctly)

00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,181
Thought we were going
back to your place.

00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,682
MAN: Babe, just
relax, it's cool.

00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,151
I just got to pick
up a little package.

00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:19,219
(cell phone dings)
That's it.

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,454
It's her again.

00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,422
I'm so screwed.

00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,558
Okay, just tell her
you're with me.

00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:25,692
Yeah, right.

00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,995
Abby, she's not even
your real mother.

00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,163
You know what, just
give me the phone.

00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,632
I have a few things that
I want to say to her.

00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:32,533
Cash and phones.

00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,201
Hand them over.

00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,168
Okay, screw
you, buddy.

00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:36,236
I said,
hand them over.

00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:37,304
Oh, my God.

00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:39,273
Okay, man, look, just
chill, just relax.

00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:40,474
Now!

00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:43,176
Slade!

00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:44,311
Stop!

00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:46,146
Slade!

00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:48,015
Slade!

00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:50,117
(gun fires)
(gasps)

00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,458
Abby, come on!

00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:14,975
Miss?

00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:16,710
Can you hear me?

00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:18,579
Miss?

00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:22,249
Are you okay?

00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,622
Can you tell me
what happened?

00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:30,691
Sara Sidle.

00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:35,062
I need to talk to Sara Sidle.

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,068
What happened?

00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:42,436
I don't know,
she's not talking.

00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,437
You want me to
call her folks?

00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,639
She's in foster care.
How do you know her?

00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:46,573
Old case.

00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,609
When Abby was five, her father
shot the whole family,

00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,676
then turned
the gun on himself.

00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,144
She was the
only survivor.

00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,546
God, that's horrible.

00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:57,084
Hey.

00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,219
Are you all right?

00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,053
Yeah.

00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,154
You're okay?
Mm-hmm.

00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,524
So, what's
going on here?

00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:05,993
You're hanging
around the alphabets,

00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:07,361
standing over the body
of a dead guy.

00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:08,695
He pulled a gun on us.

00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,430
"Us"? Slade?!

00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,698
You were down here
with Slade?!

00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,433
Abby, I told you
that kid is bad news.

00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,534
Sara, please, I...

00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,736
Did he shoot this guy?

00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:16,603
Listen to me.

00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,240
I finally remember something.

00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,275
From ten years ago.

00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,047

SIDLE: She's fine,
we'll see you soon.

00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:10,357
Uh-huh.

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,558
Okay, bye.

00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,094
Joanna's on her way.

00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,462
As soon as you give
your statement,

00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:16,730
you can go home.

00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,232
But we need to talk
about my father.

00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,601
I told you--
I think he's innocent.

00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,504
Abby, you always told me that
you didn't remember anything

00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,206
about what happened
that night.

00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,274
I didn't.

00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:30,210
But after Slade shot that guy,
I smelled something.

00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,213
Uh, a chemical,
kind of like kerosene but not.

00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,650
I smelled the exact same thing
the night my family was killed.

00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,318
You mean, inside the tent?

00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,154
When I smelled it,

00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,224
it's like I was
right back there.

00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:46,526
<i>I'd just been shot.</i>

00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,128
<i>My head was bleeding.</i>

00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:50,297
<i>He picked me up.</i>

00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,299
<i>That's when I smelled it.</i>

00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,134
<i>When he was putting me</i>
<i>into my sleeping bag.</i>

00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:55,302
SIDLE: <i>Your father?</i>
ABBY: <i>No.</i>

00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:57,204
<i>This man had a beard.</i>

00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,538
<i>It wasn't my father.</i>

00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,273
I am telling you--

00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,275
someone else was there
that night.

00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:03,543
He killed my family.

00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:04,411
Tried to kill me.

00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,679
My father didn't do it.

00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,347
Okay, all right,
listen, I...

00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:09,583
I know you
want to believe

00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,651
that your father
is innocent,

00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,353
but the evidence...

00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,354
I know what I saw.

00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,223
Abby, you were
five years old.

00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:17,724
You'd been shot,

00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,559
you saw your mother
and your sister killed.

00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,994
That kind
of trauma ...

00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,396
can play tricks
on your mind.

00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,198
I'm not making
this up.

00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,032
Abby, I...

00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:34,508
I thought you of all people
would believe me.

00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,352
Joanna.

00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:46,186
Oh.

00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,287
Cream and sugar.

00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,421
Thank you.

00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,591
Abby's just, uh,
giving her statement.

00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:55,462
Uh, I'm really glad
she reached out to you.

00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,064
She's 15.

00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,733
You're her mom.

00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,235
It's a complicated
relationship.

00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:06,740
I don't think she really
thinks of me as her mother.

00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,444
Ever since we started
the adoption process,

00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,979
she's been acting out.

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,349
Breaking curfew,
skipping school...

00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,251
She loves you
and Brian.

00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:23,089
She's been through
so much, huh?

00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,595
Sometimes I'm amazed that
she's done as well as she has.

00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:31,631
Well, I-I think
that's because of you.

00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,501
You two have
a very special bond.

00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,637
I'm so glad you're
part of her life.

00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,973
Thank you.

00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:41,575
I am, too.

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,748
I'll be right back.

00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,419
Hey, Slade!

00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,054
What the hell is
wrong with you,

00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,555
taking Abby
to that part of town?

00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:57,991
Yo, you see that?

00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:58,758
I didn't see anything.

00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,527
She is <i>not</i>
your girlfriend anymore.

00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,262
You come near her again,
and my face is gonna be

00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:03,763
the last thing
you will ever see.

00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:10,337
Let's go.

00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:13,540
Hey.

00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,641
That the guy
from the alley?

00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:15,575
Uh-huh.

00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:19,746
(sniffs)

00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:21,648
Greg?

00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,083
Yeah.

00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,417
What are you doing?

00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,053
Tell me what you smell.

00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,257
(sniffs)

00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,758
Urine.

00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,360
Booze.

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,428
And years without a shower.

00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:36,763
Why?

00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,231
I smell smoke.

00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,433
Like he's been
around a fire.

00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,136
Yeah, well, he was probably
trying to stay warm.

00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,372
Why are you so interested
in how he smells?

00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:47,073
It's not me, it's Sara.

00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,309
Uh, this guy was killed
mugging a young girl.

00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,111
She smelled something
on him that reminded her

00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:53,680
of a crime scene
from ten years ago.

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,115
Was the case unsolved?

00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,416
Ruled
a murder-suicide.

00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,218
Youngest daughter
survived.

00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:01,087
Now she thinks her father
might have been innocent.

00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:02,989
He's pretty ripe.

00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,692
It's gonna be hard to isolate
one particular smell.

00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,129

Doesn't hurt.

00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,730

what happened?

00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,534
Who hurt you
and your family?

00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,669
I don't remember.

00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,137
That's okay.

00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:34,207
What's the last thing
that you do remember?

00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,043
Mommy and Daddy.

00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,145
They were fighting.

00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,381
Then what happened?

00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,584
I don't remember.

00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,153
That's okay.

00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:50,323
I want my mommy.

00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:52,592
I know.

00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,129
Of course you do.

00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,697
It's okay.

00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,303
SANDERS:
<i>Sara?</i>

00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,739
<i>Hey, Sara.</i>

00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,745
Got the, uh, results
on your Cyranose 320.

00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,514
Your mugger was
a smelly guy.

00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:16,349
Over 20 different
scents on him.

00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,218
Most of them were
pretty common.

00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,320
Alcohol, smoke, urine.

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,622
Abby said it was something that
she hadn't smelled in ten years.

00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,158
Like kerosene,
or something.

00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,227
Could've been
gun cleaner.

00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,661
We found traces
of that on him.

00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:29,662
Huh.

00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:33,166
I didn't smell any of that
at the scene ten years ago.

00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,968
Not on the gun,
not on the father.

00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,403
Was there evidence
of another gun used?

00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,271
No.

00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:41,508
Firearms confirmed that every
shot came from the father's gun.

00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:44,110
Well, someone could've
brought the smell

00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,278
with him into the tent.

00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:46,613
Stinky stuff.

00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,448
I mean, it gets on your hands,
your clothes...

00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:49,983
So it's possible

00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,385
that someone
who smelled like gun cleaner

00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:53,720
went into the tent,

00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,155
used the
father's gun

00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,489
and wiped out the whole family.

00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,359
Abby... could be right.

00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,528
Maybe her father didn't do it.

00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:05,198
I know that you're pretty tight
with this girl.

00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,133
I know you've stayed in touch

00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,501
through all
these years.

00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,170
She needed somebody
to look after her.

00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,471
We've worked a lot of cases

00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,239
where kids lost their parents.

00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,507
Yeah...

00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:18,511
but one parent killing another,

00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,413
getting shipped off
to foster care...

00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,316
That's something
I know a little bit about.

00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,353
In all the years
we've been friends,

00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,622
we've never really talked about

00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,991
what happened
with your dad.

00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,227
And I don't mean to pry, but...

00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:35,461
You know what
happened.

00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,299
They had
a volatile relationship.

00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,467
And...

00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,603
(phone buzzes)

00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,244
It's Russell.

00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:58,551
According to my case sheet,

00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,187
you have
12 open cases.

00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:01,636
Is that right?

00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:03,056
More or less.
More or less.

00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,191
So then why are you
ordering evidence

00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,459
from long-term storage

00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,295
for a case that was closed
ten years ago?

00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,130
Uh, new evidence
was brought to my attention

00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,566
and, uh, I wanted to give
the case another look.

00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,568
Well, then, you should've
come to me first.

00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,502
I-I just wanted to see

00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,738
if what I was told
had any merit.

00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:19,639
All right.

00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,308
Where are you getting
your new information?

00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,643
Abby Fisher.

00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,378
The girl that survived?

00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:27,747
She smelled gun cleaner
and it brought back a memory

00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,016
of the night that
her family was murdered.

00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:32,652
She thinks that there was
someone else there.

00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,220
Eyewitness accounts,

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,389
especially years after the fact,

00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,358
are unreliable,
and you know that.

00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:39,425
There's more.

00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,628
Uh, I looked at
her dad's tox report

00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,730
and there was a substantial
amount of alcohol

00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,697
found in
his system,

00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:47,233
but there were other peaks
on the GC

00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,568
that were never analyzed.

00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,704
Doc ruled this a suicide.

00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,172
So you know what you're asking?

00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,540
By reopening
this case,

00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,644
you're asking Doc
to change the manner of death

00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,279
and I just don't
see him doing that,

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,580
not with what you've given me.

00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,416
Russell, Abby has believed
that her father was a murderer

00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,584
her entire
life.

00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,753
If there's a chance
that he wasn't,

00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,454
we owe it to her
to find that out.

00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:09,555
This girl lost

00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:10,990
her whole family.

00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,493
She has no one to fight for her.

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,361
Please,

00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,331
let me just take a look at it.

00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,467
All right, fine.

00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,635
Take a look at it.

00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,137
But wait, hold on.

00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,706
Look, this is going to ruffle
a lot of feathers.

00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:28,441
Not just Doc;
Ecklie, too.

00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,576
So for my sake,
you'd better be right.

00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:33,746
I know.

00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,752
Let me get this straight:

00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,255
Sara is accusing me

00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:45,258
of cutting corners on my
examination of Mr. Fisher?

00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,459
No, Doc.

00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:47,760
In light of new
information,

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,129
Sara just wants to take
a look at the case

00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,998
in a different
context.

00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:54,000
All right.

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,369
Mr. Fisher died from
a contact gunshot wound

00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:57,470
to the right temple.

00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,073
There was gunshot residue
on his right hand,

00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:02,075
his gun was found
beside him,

00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:05,345
and he had a blood tox level
of .23.

00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,513
Tell me, please,
what is it about this

00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,415
that <i>doesn't</i> indicate suicide?

00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:12,218
In the tox report,
Sara found a peak

00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,587
from the GC that
was never analyzed.

00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,189
Got that tox report right here.

00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,191
What peak are
we talking about?

00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,292
RUSSELL:
That one.

00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:20,193
ROBBINS:
That's minor.

00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,261
It has the same retention time
as ibuprofen.

00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,330
That's why it wasn't analyzed.
Could be,

00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,667
but you can't be sure
unless you do a Mass Spec,

00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:28,568
so please,
Doc,

00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,069
just pull the blood for me.

00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,471
Retest it.

00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,006
Sure.

00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,214
ROBBINS:
Sorry.

00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,982
You and Sara are out of luck.

00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,084
Those samples were destroyed
three years ago.

00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,320
D.B., if you

00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,621
feel this strongly about it,

00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,657
the only choice is
to exhume the body.

00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:56,596
You're digging up my father?

00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,531
Well, we need to do some
additional testing.

00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,267
Then what
happens to him?

00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,269
He'll be
re-buried.

00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,138
Like a second funeral?

00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:07,273
Well, there won't be
a service or anything.

00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,409
He'll just be returned
to his grave.

00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,247
I didn't get to go
to his funeral.

00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,050
Or Mom's.

00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,119
Or Hannah's.

00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,288
You were still
in the hospital.

00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:24,490
Did you?

00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,126
Go to your father's funeral?

00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,728
No.

00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,364
Why not?

00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,999
I wasn't allowed.

00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:36,969
Do you miss him?

00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,238
Yeah.

00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:41,374
I do.

00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:51,317
Guy looks pretty
good for being

00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,752
in the ground
for ten years.

00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,454
Miracle of
embalming.

00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,321
Mm-hmm.

00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,057
So, are you gonna
do a full autopsy?

00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,592
It's not necessary.

00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:02,562
Barry Fisher died from
a gunshot wound to the head,

00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,430
and nothing is going
to change that fact.

00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:08,000
Well, something caused
the peak on the GC.

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,736
If he was under
the influence of
some type of drug,

00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,672
then maybe his death
wasn't a suicide.

00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:13,973
If that's the case,

00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,410
I will change my ruling
to "undetermined."

00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,014
Well, good thing
he was autopsied.

00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,683
Kept the organs
in a plastic bag.

00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,718
I'm just glad
the mortuary

00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,054
kept them in the bag
after they embalmed him.

00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:30,690
Organs weren't exposed
to formaldehyde.

00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,760
Best bet for identifying
acute dose of a drug

00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,696
is the liver or the kidney.

00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,473
Barry Fisher
was drugged.

00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,209
Tox found trichloroethanol
in his liver sample.

00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,579
A metabolite of
chloral hydrate, right?

00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:54,647
That's what
the peak was.

00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:55,615
It wasn't ibuprofen.

00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:56,716
It was a knockout drug.

00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,119
Doc changed the manner of death

00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,088
from "suicide"
to "undetermined."

00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,723
You were right.

00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:05,324
Okay.

00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,293
Where are we?

00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,561
Well...

00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:11,531
chloral hydrate is not
a recreational drug.

00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,232
Fisher wouldn't have
taken it voluntarily.

00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,201
So somebody drugged him.

00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:18,104
Doc didn't find any injection
marks on Fisher's body,

00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:20,973
but there were remnants of
paper cups in the fire pit.

00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,742
The drug could've been
put into his drink.

00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:26,412
Why would somebody
incapacitate the husband

00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,649
if they were already planning
on shooting him?

00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:31,551
Maybe to get the gun?

00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:33,519
I mean, if
the plan was

00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,655
to murder the family
and frame the father,

00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,056
the killer would have
had to use his gun.

00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,392
Fisher would not have
handed it over willingly.

00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,394
Boy, somebody sure
hated the Fishers.

00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,095
Kill the whole family?

00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,064
Those two little girls?

00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,732
I'll see if they had
any enemies.

00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,634
So...

00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,269
do I have the okay to...

00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,104
officially reopen the case?

00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,540
You bet.

00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,010
When Doc ruled it a suicide,

00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,278
I boxed up all of the evidence

00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,746
because there wasn't
going to be a trial.

00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,715
So... almost
everything

00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:04,050
that I collected

00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,718
has never been processed.
All right.

00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,486
Have the boxes
sent to the garage.

00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:08,521
Finn and Morgan

00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,222
will set up the tent
and work the evidence.

00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:13,192
You have a close
personal relationship

00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,226
with Abby Fisher.

00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,295
I need you to take a backseat.

00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,264
Fair enough.

00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:19,539
FINLAY:
Hey, Morgan.

00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:20,566
You all set up?

00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:21,968
BRODY:
Yep.

00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:25,171
I used Sara's original
crime scene photos
as a guide.

00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,678
Ah, those poor kids.

00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:35,381
Had no idea that
their fun camping trip

00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:36,482
would end
like this.

00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,017
Yeah.

00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:41,687
I, uh, placed note cards
reflecting the DNA results.

00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,055
"M" is for Mom,

00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,991
"H" is for Hannah,
"A" is for Abby.

00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,560
All right.
And according to Sara's sketch,

00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,463
the two girls were inside
their sleeping bags over here...

00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,697
Hannah, Abby...

00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,265
and then over here,
the mom.

00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,101
Yeah, the nine-year-old, Hannah,

00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,469
had Mom's blood
on her feet,

00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,270
so we know Mom
was killed first,

00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,271
right over there.

00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,740
This, here,

00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,209
is Hannah's blood trail.

00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,543
FINLAY:
Hannah's wound

00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,545
was immediately
debilitating and fatal.

00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,148
So she would not have been able
to walk back to her bed.

00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,986
<i>So somebody carried her</i>
<i>and then tucked her in.</i>

00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,225
Well, the killer thought
Abby was dead, too,

00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:20,493
'cause he tucked <i>her</i> in.

00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:23,362
Shows remorse.

00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:26,298
Or he wanted to make it look
like it was the father.

00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,300
Somebody who cared
about his kids.

00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,136
BRODY:
Yeah. Either way,
looks like the killer

00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:31,437
had to touch the sleeping bags,

00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:32,972
so it could be
a good source of prints.

00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:34,106
Just like the tent flap.

00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:37,176
I'm going to swab
every blood drop in here.

00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,611
Maybe we'll get lucky

00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:42,615
and the killer left
some of himself behind.

00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:33,065
I got prints.

00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,400
Some on the tent flap.

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,435
Those were unidentified.
But I also found one

00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,003
on Hannah's
sleeping bag.

00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,271
That one paid off.

00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,639
Garth Fogel.

00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,374
He's a registered
sex offender.

00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,710
Convicted of molesting
a little girl back in '95.

00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,413
He was released
from prison in 2004,

00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,982
one month before the
Fishers were murdered.

00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,318
SIDLE:
He has a beard.
The man that Abby remembered

00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:55,020
tucking her into her
sleeping bag had a beard.

00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,422
And smelled of
gun cleaner.

00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,723
When Fogel
was arrested,

00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,025
police found over
15 guns in his place.

00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:01,060
ANDREWS:
Hey.

00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,629
I analyzed the blood samples
Finn collected from the tent.

00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,132
Everything belonged
to Mom and the two girls.

00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:08,300
Except for one that turned out
to be animal blood.

00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,402
"Animal blood"?
I'm still testing

00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,171
to figure out what kind
of animal it came from.

00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:14,106
There was no other DNA
in the tent?

00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,341
Sorry.

00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:17,576
But when I tested
Garth Fogel's samples

00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,145
against the DNA samples,

00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:20,479
I got a big surprise.

00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,215
He was the biological father

00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,317
of the nine-year-old
daughter Hannah.

00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,456
Wait, I-I knew that Barry Fisher

00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,991
wasn't Hannah's birth father.

00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:33,659
According to a family friend,

00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,428
Kathy Fisher told everyone
that Hannah's father died

00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,564
in a car accident
before she was even born.

00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,667
If I were pregnant
with a sex offender's baby,

00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,335
I'd probably lie about it, too.

00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,538
Maybe that lie
caught up with her.

00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,273
Got the family killed.

00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:56,649
Garth Fogel?

00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,287
I'm CSI Nick Stokes.

00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,758
I asked for a coffee
20 minutes ago.

00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:09,128
Answer some of my questions, and
I'll see what I can do for you.

00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:10,663
I haven't done anything wrong.

00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,998
You mean recently
or ten years ago?

00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,171
Do you recognize
this family?

00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,544
I'll take that as a no.

00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:26,445
Um...

00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,047
how about now?

00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,284
Oh, these are good.

00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,719
How about these?

00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:39,225
The Fishers went
on a camping trip and someone

00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:40,993
slaughtered them in their tent.

00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,497
Wasn't me.

00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:48,267
The girls were five and nine.

00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,436
They're really cute,
really innocent.

00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:52,304
That's just the way
you like them, isn't it?

00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,339
That's sick, you son of a bitch!

00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:54,607
She was my daughter!

00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:57,376
Sit your ass down!

00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:00,412
I don't think the fact
that she was your daughter

00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,648
would even stop
a pervert like you.

00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:05,117
You probably even thought
you had a right to her.

00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:08,254
You were out of prison a month
and you got that itch again.

00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:09,188
Didn't you?

00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,058
I think you followed
the Fishers to their campsite.

00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,594
<i>Drugged the dad</i>
<i>to get him out of the way.</i>

00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,162
<i>And took his gun.</i>

00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,998
<i>Went into the tent</i>
<i>to grab Hannah.</i>

00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:21,267
<i>But Kathy wasn't gonna</i>
<i>let you take her daughter</i>

00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:22,067
<i>without a fight.</i>

00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,402
(grunts)

00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:26,305
Mommy! Mommy!

00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:28,340
What did you do?!

00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,142
You certainly weren't
going back to prison.

00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,377
<i>So, you got rid</i>
<i>of the witnesses.</i>

00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:32,311
I'm sorry.

00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,484
And there must be some shred

00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:39,652
of humanity

00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:42,221
<i>left in you because</i>
<i>after you shot</i>

00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:43,689
<i>both girls,</i>
<i>you felt bad about it.</i>

00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:45,491
<i>Tucked them</i>
<i>into their sleeping bags.</i>

00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:48,227
Then you finished off the dad,

00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:49,595
and made it look
like a murder/suicide.

00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,430
Sound about right?
That's a load of crap.

00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,098
I was nowhere near that family.

00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,267
Then how do you explain
your fingerprint

00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,369
on Hannah's sleeping bag?

00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,310
You'd better start
talking to me, man.

00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:08,314
All right.

00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,983
I saw them at their house.

00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:13,185
They were packing
to go camping.

00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,186
What were you doing there?

00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,354
I wanted to see my daughter.

00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:19,458
Kathy never told me
that she was pregnant.

00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,328
I found out in prison.

00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,699
So I looked them up
as soon as I got out.

00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,033
But Kathy wasn't

00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,435
gonna let you
anywhere near Hannah.

00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:31,203
So you followed them
to their campsite.

00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,104
No.

00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:34,406
I went to their house.

00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,343
Kathy was packing the
car and I told her

00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:41,046
that Hannah has every right to
know who her real father is.

00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,715
And that is me!

00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,185
Kathy told me to go to hell.

00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:48,587
That piss you off?
Yes, it pissed me off!

00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,359
I lost my temper, all right?

00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,360
I grabbed the sleeping bag

00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,028
and I ripped it out of
the car, and that is

00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:57,663
how my fingerprints got on it.

00:24:58,397 --> 00:24:59,465
Kathy threatened
to call the cops,

00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:00,666
so I got the hell out of there.

00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:04,536
I never saw them after that.

00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,106
SANDERS:
<i>Nick thinks</i>

00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:07,973
Fogel's lying.

00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,041
Does he have an alibi?

00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:10,275
Said he was with his mom.

00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,643
Great. Let's talk to her.

00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,045
She died five years ago.

00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:14,680
What?!
Nick is getting a warrant

00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,615
to pull his old cell
and credit card records.

00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:19,118
See if we can at least place
him near Mount Charleston

00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:20,119
around the time
of the murders.

00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,354
Abby picked Fogel
out of that mug book.

00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,056
Thought he looked familiar,
she couldn't say for sure

00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:26,091
whether he's the guy
that killed her family or not.

00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,527
There's so much she doesn't
remember from the night.

00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,032
There might be a way we can help
her recover those memories.

00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,246

00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:51,350

00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:53,552
Yeah.

00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,189
Just weird... being back.

00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:59,024
Abby, you do not
have to do this.

00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,626
I want to.

00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:05,330
So... how do we do this?

00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,200
You gonna hypnotize
me or something?

00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,301
(laughs)
No.

00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,737
We're just hoping that being
back here might jog your memory.

00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,406
You know--
the sights, the smells?

00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,508
Let your mind drift back.

00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,545
It's worth a shot.

00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:31,523
You did a great job.

00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,359
It looks exactly

00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,627
SANDERS:
Thanks. I even

00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,196
put gun cleaner inside the tent

00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:38,997
to see if it helps.

00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:40,532
And I brought this.

00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,244
Like a deer?

00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,311
Did you see his face?

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,115
I couldn't make it out.

00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,353
He just shot them!

00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:15,621
It's okay.

00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,156
It's all right.
You did great.

00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,192
Yeah.

00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:22,294
It's okay.

00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,166
FINLAY:
Henry identified

00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,035
the animal blood we found
in the Fishers' tent.

00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:31,970
It's elk blood.

00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,173
Oh, maybe that's what Abby
saw on the killer's jacket.

00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,042
I mean, an elk kind
of looks like a deer,

00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:38,110
just with bigger antlers.

00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,113
Okay, so we have a killer
who smells like gun cleaner

00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,582
and has traces
of elk blood on him.

00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,050
He's a hunter.

00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,485
And if he was wearing a
jacket with a patch on it,

00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:47,986
maybe he belongs
to a hunting club.

00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:49,621
There are a lot of
them in Nevada.

00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:51,623
Any close to Mount Charleston?

00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,724
Let's see.

00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,362
This club's logo is a duck.

00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,401
That one.

00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:04,603
That looks like
an elk to me.

00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,338
"Legend Creek Hunting Club."

00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,375
(door closes)

00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:12,344
Dead animals.

00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:14,313
Awesome.
God, it looks like they're just

00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,048
staring us right in the eye.

00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:18,417
So lifelike.
Thank you.

00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:19,651
Stuffed them myself.

00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,619
Right back there.

00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:23,488
That 12-point buck? Three shots

00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,389
to take him down.

00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,224
He wanted to live.

00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,759
He's a beauty.

00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:28,527
Randy Pruitt.

00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:30,095
Club president.

00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:31,596
What can I do for you ladies?

00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,365
This is Sarah Sidle,
I'm Morgan Brody.

00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:35,534
We are with the Las Vegas
crime lab.

00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:37,369
Crime lab?
We need to take a look

00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:39,638
at your membership records
from 2004.

00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:42,240
Specifically the members
who had tags to hunt elk.

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,476
(laughs)
Elk pressing charges these days?

00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:47,045
We're investigating
the murder of a family

00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,547
shot to death
on Mount Charleston.

00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:51,216
We hunt animals,

00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,751
not human beings.
Yeah?

00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:54,753
Well, some people
can't tell the difference.

00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,655
These people...

00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:58,490
are my friends.
I'm sorry.

00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,525
We're still gonna have
to take a look those records.

00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,527
Well, our members have
a right to privacy.

00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:04,196
Yeah.

00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,398
Not anymore.

00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:21,646
2004.

00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:23,749
Thank you.

00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,419
Let's pull all the members

00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,321
that have beards
and tags to hunt elk,

00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:31,022
and show the pictures to Abby.

00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:33,024
Let's hope she can
identify our killer.

00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,604
Take your time, okay?

00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:03,588
That's him.

00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:04,656
Are you sure?

00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,391
Positive.

00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,395
Yeah, we got an I.D.

00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:12,230
Donald Wraith.

00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,432
Lives in Henderson.

00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,172
Donald Wraith!

00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:22,107
LVPD! Turn off
the engine!

00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,074
Out of the truck!

00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,010
Get out!

00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:28,180
Said get out!

00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:38,690
Looks like the hunter
became the hunted.

00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:47,766
STOKES:
Hey, Super Dave.

00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:50,535
Sorry to drag you
all the way out here, man.

00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,003
You kidding me?

00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,638
Trees, good clean air.

00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,273
It's nice to be out in nature.

00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:01,313
STOKES:
Nine millimeter casing.

00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,715
The ammo's consistent
with the victim's gun.

00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:07,219
Powder burns indicate
he was shot at close range.

00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,388
Yeah, but he couldn't
have shot himself--

00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,290
the gun would have
fallen out of his hand.

00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:17,262
Killer tried to make it
look like a suicide.

00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:26,705
Abby Fisher I.D.'s Donald Wraith
as the man who shot her family.

00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:29,107
We come out here to pick him
up and find him murdered?

00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,109
Maybe to keep
him quiet?

00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:32,010
Maybe.

00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:34,713
Sounds to me
like someone else was involved

00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:36,581
in this massacre ten years ago.

00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:39,684
I thought Abby Fisher
only remembers one man

00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,986
in the tent
that night.

00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:42,521
Doesn't mean that somebody
else wasn't there.

00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:43,688
Garth Fogel.

00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,190
The pedophile?

00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,758
Yeah, we haven't cleared him
as a suspect.

00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:49,094
And so far I haven't been able
to find a connection

00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:51,029
between Donald Wraith
and the Fisher family.

00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:54,766
So, you're thinking Wraith's
connection is with Fogel.

00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,301
Maybe they were
friends.

00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:58,069
Fogel wanted
his daughter.

00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:00,005
The Fishers weren't gonna give
her back without a fight.

00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:01,706
Maybe he brings Wraith
for backup.

00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,476
Go prove it.

00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,282
Hey.
Hey.

00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:12,517
Nick said he found trace
on Donald Wraith's gun.

00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:13,752
Were you able
to identify it?

00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:15,620
Yeah, it was a
type of resin.

00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,757
Traditionally, a hydrocarbon
secretion from plants,

00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:22,027
resins were a prized possession
in the ancient world.

00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:24,496
I'm sure you're familiar
with frankincense and myrrh.

00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:25,664
Gifts for baby Jesus.

00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,998
You're a wise woman.

00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,533
But in this
day and age,

00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:31,403
humans have been able to
create synthetic resins

00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,104
that are much stronger
and more versatile

00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:34,472
than their natural
predecessors.

00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:38,243
As in this case, we
have a unique blend

00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,711
of methyl methacrylate,

00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:43,048
thixotropic and a
polymerization catalyst.

00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:45,216
Aren't synthetic resins used
a lot in construction?

00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,485
Yes, but...
'Cause
Garth Fogel works

00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,187
as a laborer
for a construction company.

00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,989
If we can prove he had
access, then we...

00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,392
You didn't let
me finish.
Sorry.

00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:56,328
The chemical structure
of this particular resin

00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:58,430
is only used
in one industry.

00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,398
Taxidermy.

00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:02,467
Taxidermy.

00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:05,737
Does Garth Fogel have a penchant
for stuffing woodland creatures?

00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:06,972
No.

00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:08,406
But I know someone who does.

00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:09,641
Thank you.

00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:13,612
You lied to me,
Randy.

00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:15,580
You said you didn't
hunt people.

00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,415
But you murdered
Donald Wraith.

00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:20,251
And you murdered
the Fisher family.

00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,287
No. No, I didn't.

00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:26,024
We found a clear cast resin
on Donald Wraith's gun.

00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:28,493
It's the same resin that
you purchased two weeks ago

00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,495
for your taxidermy.

00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,264
I-Is that all
you've got?

00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,566
No, I have motive.

00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:39,170
You and Donald Wraith killed
the Fishers ten years ago.

00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:42,207
Donald was about to be arrested,
so you killed him

00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:44,576
so he wouldn't
implicate you.

00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:47,145
But you had already
implicated yourself.

00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:50,515
We pulled your fingerprints
off the file

00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,050
that you gave us
at the hunting club.

00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,653
And it was a match to prints
from inside the tent

00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,421
that the family was
slaughtered in.

00:35:58,456 --> 00:35:59,624
What happened, Randy?!

00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:02,060
Did you get tired
of hunting elk?

00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,262
Did you want your prey
to beg for mercy?

00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,065
It wasn't like that.

00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,103
We never planned
on killing anyone.

00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:14,439
What was your plan?

00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,476
Donald wanted to have
some fun with the wife.

00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:22,280
Her and the husband came by
the shop, asked directions.

00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,449
Sorry to bother you guys--
it feels like

00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:26,418
we've been driving
in circles for hours.

00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:27,752
I'm a terrible
navigator.

00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:30,522
We wanted to set up camp
near Deer Stream trail head.

00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,190
Can't seem to find it.
Well, that's...

00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:34,759
...easy to miss.

00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,095
What you do is you
hit Timber Canyon.

00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:38,329
There's a fork,
stay to the right,

00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,464
it'll take you
all the way in.

00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:41,633
Thank you so much.

00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:42,767
My pleasure, ma'am.

00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:50,408
You followed them
back to the campsite?

00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:52,711
You had to get the husband
out of the way.

00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:55,513
How did you drug him,
exactly?

00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,682
Saw him sitting
alone at the fire.

00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:00,151
Pretended we were
camping nearby.

00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:04,255
Brought over
some booze.

00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:06,558
When he wasn't looking,
we slipped him a Mickey.

00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,493
You know, most people don't
just walk around,

00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:09,694
carrying chloral hydrate
on them,

00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:12,097
unless they've done
this kind of thing before.

00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:16,201
What happened
after Fisher passed out?

00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:20,038
I stood guard while
Donald went in the tent.

00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:21,172
With Barry
Fisher's gun.

00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,608
He was only gonna threaten
her, keep her quiet.

00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:25,510
But she fought back.

00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,113
I heard a shot.

00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,548
<i>Then two more.</i>

00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,321
What did you do?

00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:40,592
We didn't know
they had children.

00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:46,364
Donald said the girls saw his
face, so he had to kill them.

00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:53,505
I took them back into
their sleeping bags,

00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:57,175
while he went out to
take care of the husband.

00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:03,314
There is a problem
with your story, Randy.

00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:06,317
The youngest daughter
survived.

00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:10,388
And she identified
Donald Wraith as the person

00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,624
that put her back
into the sleeping bag.

00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:14,092
Not you.

00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:15,593
He's the one
that felt bad.

00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,195
And I am
willing to bet...

00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,699
that you are the one that pulled
the trigger that night.

00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,138
Either way,
your hunting days are over.

00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:46,157
So... they didn't
even know us?

00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:48,760
They were just
bad people.

00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,196
And you and your family were
in the wrong place

00:38:51,196 --> 00:38:52,463
at the wrong time.

00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:55,333
That's messed up.

00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:57,702
Your father was
innocent.

00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,707
All these years,
I blamed him.

00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,177
Hated him.

00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:10,682
Thought he killed
Mom and Hannah.

00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,418
Tried to kill me.

00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,554
You can let
that all go now.

00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:19,757
Your dad was
a good man.

00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:22,493
And he loved you
very much.

00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,403
Hey, ready to go home?

00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:35,607
Yeah.

00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:41,980
Thank you.

00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:44,015
Any time.

00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,455
Oh, One D's playing
at the Hard Rock

00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:52,023
Saturday night.
You in?

00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:53,391
One Direction?

00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,026
Seriously?

00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:56,094
No, I'm just kidding.

00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:57,729
It's Lorde,
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,565
Cool.

00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,281
SANDERS:
You look like your dad.

00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:20,718
He used to read to me
when I was a kid.

00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:23,187
<i>Charlotte's Web</i>
was my favorite.

00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:25,590
Must've read it
a hundred times.

00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,724
That's a nice memory.

00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,660
I have a lot of nice
memories of him.

00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,996
My mom, too.

00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,566
They were toxic when they
were together, though.

00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:39,637
Your mom said
your dad was abusive?

00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,506
She killed him
in self-defense?

00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:44,242
That's what she said.

00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:47,679
You don't believe her?

00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:51,616
Look, I know my dad
wasn't a saint,

00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:56,654
but my mom was
an alcoholic

00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,556
who suffered from
mental illness.

00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:03,761
I'm just not sure that things
were as black and white

00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,296
as she made
them out to be.

00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:09,734
Well, you did say they had
a volatile relationship.

00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:12,036
Fact is...

00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,238
I'll never know what
happened that night.

00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:19,510
This is gonna
sound horrible,

00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:23,081
but I'm kind of
jealous of Abby.

00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:28,753
She gets to rewrite her
whole family history.

00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,591
Nothing will ever change
what my mother did.

00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:41,599
Well, you can't
change the past,

00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,203
but you always
have the future.

00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:48,106
Your mom's
still alive.

00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:51,542
Not too late for you
to start over.

00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,416
I don't know if I could.
