cut somebody off

we need your DNA.

00:05:27,112 --> 00:05:29,348
Field rotation for the Lab Techs

to get them

00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,218
when you're done.
No, thanks.

00:08:53,285 --> 00:08:55,487
Uh, I got one of my queens
bringing me a suit.

00:08:55,554 --> 00:08:57,957
I will not be throwing
on these nasty ass scrubs.

00:08:58,023 --> 00:09:00,459
You are covered in blood.

00:09:00,526 --> 00:09:02,094
Your clothes are evidence now

00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:04,997
and I'm going to come back in
here and I'm going to get them.

00:09:05,064 --> 00:09:07,466
If not, you're just going to be
standing here in your underwear.

00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:08,801
What underwear?

00:09:08,867 --> 00:09:10,102
I don't wear drawers.

00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:11,604
(wry laugh)

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,273
This is not a compromise,
Kellen.

00:09:15,307 --> 00:09:17,710
You might want
to close your eyes

00:09:17,776 --> 00:09:20,079
or turn around
or something.

00:09:28,954 --> 00:09:30,889
Come in.

00:09:30,956 --> 00:09:33,425
Come in slow,
slow, slow.

00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:34,827
All right, stop.

00:10:04,423 --> 00:10:07,259
♪ ♪

00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:39,325
♪ ♪

00:11:07,886 --> 00:11:10,522
50 AE casings came
back clean on IBIS,

00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:13,659
but Ballistics was able
to pull type and caliber

00:11:13,726 --> 00:11:16,195
from the copper jacket
fragments inside the limo.

00:11:16,262 --> 00:11:19,565
Consistent with .50 caliber
Desert Eagle handgun.

00:11:19,632 --> 00:11:20,833
Yeah.

00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:23,902
Blood on the
seats suggests

00:11:23,969 --> 00:11:25,638
that the victim was sitting
here, on the left,

00:11:25,704 --> 00:11:27,239
with Drops somewhere
to the right.

00:11:28,774 --> 00:11:31,677
Six shots into the limo.

00:11:31,744 --> 00:11:34,647
Autopsy reports cause of death

00:11:34,713 --> 00:11:36,015
was single gunshot wound

00:11:36,081 --> 00:11:37,249
to the head
with variable trajectory,

00:11:37,316 --> 00:11:38,884
so one of those was
the kill shot.

00:11:38,951 --> 00:11:40,252
Yeah, it's
just hard

00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:41,520
to say which one.

00:11:41,587 --> 00:11:43,155
The crash tossed everything
all over the place.

00:11:43,222 --> 00:11:44,757
And it's basically
one big mess now.

00:11:44,823 --> 00:11:46,926
Sounds like Drops's story is
holding up, though.

00:11:46,992 --> 00:11:48,193
Gentlemen.

00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,762
Follow me.

00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,097
STOKES:
There were two
shots fired

00:11:52,164 --> 00:11:53,332
through the glass,

00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,200
but as you can see,
different sizes,

00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:56,769
different calibers.

00:11:56,835 --> 00:11:58,604
Big one's consistent
with the .50.

00:11:58,671 --> 00:11:59,872
Yeah, but check out

00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:02,107
the beveling
on the impacts.

00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:03,742
Um, based on the beveling,

00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:07,012
these shots were fired
from opposite directions.

00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:08,347
GRISSOM:
Tinting film is applied

00:12:08,414 --> 00:12:09,782
to the inside
of a window,

00:12:09,848 --> 00:12:12,718
so the small-caliber round was
fired from inside the limo.

00:12:12,785 --> 00:12:15,354
Well, I analyzed
the radial cracks

00:12:15,421 --> 00:12:17,256
from both holes.

00:12:17,323 --> 00:12:18,657
The cracks from
the shot

00:12:18,724 --> 00:12:20,359
that was fired out

00:12:20,426 --> 00:12:22,127
was terminated by the cracks

00:12:22,194 --> 00:12:23,996
from the shot that was fired in.

00:12:30,603 --> 00:12:33,105
Someone inside the limo had
a gun.

00:12:33,172 --> 00:12:34,840
And, evidently, Drops
wasn't telling us

00:12:34,907 --> 00:12:36,308
the whole story after all.

00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:49,467
DROPS:
Look, I didn't lie, all right?

00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:51,436
I just left a couple
of things out.

00:12:51,502 --> 00:12:53,070
Well, you want
to fill in the blanks

00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:54,939
before I ship you
for obstruction?

00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:56,808
We shot back;
it's that simple.

00:12:56,874 --> 00:12:57,909
We?

00:12:57,975 --> 00:12:59,076
You both had guns?

00:12:59,143 --> 00:13:00,878
Nah, man, just one of us.

00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:02,747
Well, I bet I can
guess which one.

00:13:02,814 --> 00:13:05,049
'Cause you're the only person
in the limo

00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:06,784
with a registered .38 revolver.

00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:09,487
(gunshot, tires squealing)

00:13:09,554 --> 00:13:11,956
(gunshots, bullets ricocheting)

00:13:12,023 --> 00:13:13,658
I guess you know
that blood is

00:13:13,724 --> 00:13:15,693
a good way
to wash off GSR, right?

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,728
Nah, my dude.
Look, I ain't do no shooting.

00:13:17,795 --> 00:13:20,398
All right? Somebody jacked that
piece off me, like, a year ago.

00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:21,699
You're telling me that

00:13:21,766 --> 00:13:24,469
you didn't shoot a gun
from inside the limo?

00:13:24,535 --> 00:13:26,104
You're blaming it
on a dead guy,

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,039
a dead guy who just
happens to have

00:13:28,106 --> 00:13:29,507
the same gun as you.

00:13:29,574 --> 00:13:30,575
What can I say, man?

00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:33,010
.38's back in style.

00:13:33,077 --> 00:13:34,445
Besides, man, Champ
always had heat.

00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:35,446
Everybody know that.

00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:36,981
He got my back.

00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:38,950
You know, I know
everything about you, Kellen.

00:13:39,016 --> 00:13:40,184
You're just a small-time
street thug

00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:41,385
and drug dealer
from Northtown.

00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:42,487
You got the nickname "Drops"

00:13:42,553 --> 00:13:43,621
'cause when you sold
the chronic,

00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:44,789
you made a lot of drops.

00:13:44,856 --> 00:13:46,057
Wow, and here I was thinking

00:13:46,124 --> 00:13:48,126
that I got
that name based off

00:13:48,192 --> 00:13:49,560
my boxing skills,

00:13:49,627 --> 00:13:52,029
seeing as how I used to drop
fools in the squared circle.

00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:53,965
I don't know, you're a little
slow behind the jab.

00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:56,067
And all you do is a lot
of bobbing and weaving.

00:13:56,134 --> 00:13:58,603
So get me the gun, and I'll
let you have your massage.

00:14:00,638 --> 00:14:02,206
I tossed it after
the shooting, man.

00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:03,508
Look, CSI's been

00:14:03,574 --> 00:14:05,343
all over that area,
they didn't find any guns.

00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:08,379
That's because a gun like that
in a hood like that,

00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:09,647
that's rent money, baby.

00:14:09,714 --> 00:14:10,915
Excuse me, beautiful.

00:14:10,982 --> 00:14:12,383
We're gonna wrap up
these chicken wings

00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,751
and take them to go.

00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:15,520
Whoa, okay, easy now, Kojaks.

00:14:15,586 --> 00:14:18,356
No gun, no happy ending.

00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:20,158
Come on.

00:14:20,224 --> 00:14:23,995
Don't tell me you're tired
of the field already.

00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:26,230
No, I had to catch up
on my Perez Hilton.

00:14:26,297 --> 00:14:28,366
I take it you're not gonna
pull a Sanders on us, then?

00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:30,902
Let's see:
Clean, friendly lab,

00:14:30,968 --> 00:14:32,770
bullet-strewn,
urine-soaked street--

00:14:32,837 --> 00:14:33,838
that's a tough call.

00:14:33,905 --> 00:14:35,940
You have something for me?

00:14:36,007 --> 00:14:37,575
Oh, most definitely.

00:14:37,642 --> 00:14:40,077
I I.D.'d the serial number
on the piece of plastic

00:14:40,144 --> 00:14:41,179
Warrick found in the street.

00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:42,180
Yeah?

00:14:42,246 --> 00:14:43,681
It's a GMC
seatbelt adjuster.

00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:45,650
Keeps the shoulder
harness webbing

00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:46,951
from rubbing on the neck.

00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:49,287
Okay. You got make
and model of that car?

00:14:49,353 --> 00:14:51,756
HODGES:
Sure do.

00:14:51,823 --> 00:14:54,725
But I don't think
it's gonna help you much.

00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:56,394
Oh.

00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:04,902
That's it.

00:15:10,308 --> 00:15:12,376
ROBBINS:
She had atlanto-occipital
dislocation,

00:15:12,443 --> 00:15:14,479
a basilar skull fracture

00:15:14,545 --> 00:15:16,214
and contre-coup injuries

00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,082
from bouncing her head
on the ground.

00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:20,284
C.O.D. is craniocerebral trauma.

00:15:20,351 --> 00:15:22,120
And are those ligature marks?

00:15:22,186 --> 00:15:24,088
They are.

00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:26,224
The right wrist
was broken.

00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,558
Take a look at the shoulder.

00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,995
The humeral head's in front
of the usual articulation.

00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:33,297
Completely dislocated.

00:15:33,364 --> 00:15:34,665
She was dragged by her wrist.

00:15:34,732 --> 00:15:36,100
We found a
seatbelt adjuster

00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:37,568
at the scene.

00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:39,337
Maybe she was dragged
by a seatbelt.

00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:40,972
(screaming)

00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:46,310
Whatever it was,
the dragging went on a while.

00:15:46,377 --> 00:15:48,980
Abrasions on her elbows,
ribs, and knee caps

00:15:49,046 --> 00:15:50,148
go down to the bone.

00:15:54,685 --> 00:15:56,521
Her eyes.

00:15:56,587 --> 00:15:57,555
What about them?

00:15:57,622 --> 00:15:58,656
They're the wrong color.

00:15:58,723 --> 00:15:59,657
They were green.

00:15:59,724 --> 00:16:00,925
You mean these?

00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:04,328
Green contacts.

00:16:16,941 --> 00:16:19,210
BROWN:
I'm sorry for your
loss, Mrs. Gentry,

00:16:19,277 --> 00:16:21,212
but we could really
use your help.

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,181
Is there anyone
in this neighborhood

00:16:23,247 --> 00:16:24,916
that your daughter
might have been

00:16:24,982 --> 00:16:26,717
going to see
last night?

00:16:26,784 --> 00:16:28,653
(sobbing)

00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:30,855
(cell phone ringing)

00:16:30,922 --> 00:16:33,090
Excuse me.

00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:38,129
Hey, Cath.

00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:44,102
Are you serious?

00:16:44,168 --> 00:16:45,603
You're kidding, right?

00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,073
I'm actually with
the mother right now.

00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,608
I'll handle it.

00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:51,742
I'm sorry.

00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:53,411
I don't know why
Melissa would have...

00:16:53,478 --> 00:16:55,746
Ma'am, your daughter's alive.

00:16:55,813 --> 00:16:58,683
What?

00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:00,384
We made a mistake.

00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:02,920
The victim that we found was
carrying your daughter's I.D.

00:17:02,987 --> 00:17:04,822
Are you sure?

00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:05,890
Yes. She just spoke

00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:07,859
with my supervisor,
she's fine.

00:17:07,925 --> 00:17:09,360
(laughing)

00:17:09,427 --> 00:17:11,629
It's a miracle.

00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:12,697
Oh, thank God.

00:17:12,764 --> 00:17:14,665
(sobbing):
It's a miracle!

00:17:17,802 --> 00:17:19,971
All right.

00:17:20,037 --> 00:17:22,173
There's just
one thing.

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,243
We still need to
identify the victim.

00:17:27,478 --> 00:17:31,449
Could you tell me
if you recognize this girl?

00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:35,553
That's Simone.

00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,488
(sobbing):
Oh, no.

00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:41,292
That's Simone Molinez.

00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,227
That's my daughter's
best friend.

00:17:43,294 --> 00:17:44,328
(sobbing):
Oh...

00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,467
There were no drugs or alcohol
in the limo driver's system.

00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:51,536
Really?

00:17:51,602 --> 00:17:52,770
What about Drops?

00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:55,206
Also clean.
As was your head shot vic.

00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:57,041
Club scene's getting
really tame these days.

00:17:57,108 --> 00:17:58,910
There's got to be something
on the rolled-up hundred.

00:17:58,976 --> 00:18:00,244
It's positive
for cocaine,

00:18:00,311 --> 00:18:03,147
along with every Benjamin
in the country.

00:18:03,214 --> 00:18:06,818
But no coke in the driver
or the passengers?

00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:09,487
That doesn't
make any sense.

00:18:09,554 --> 00:18:11,956
♪ ♪

00:18:32,777 --> 00:18:35,813
You know, if you're still
having trouble coming to terms

00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,882
with the fact that this is
no longer your lab,

00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:39,016
I suggest counseling.

00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,486
I would like you

00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:43,287
Okay.

00:18:43,354 --> 00:18:45,523
Hmm. Boogers on a nose straw.

00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,258
Yep.

00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:49,794
Well, in recognition of
your years of previous service,

00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:51,162
I will make it a priority.

00:18:51,229 --> 00:18:52,830
Thank you.

00:18:52,897 --> 00:18:54,866
You're welcome.

00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,773
I gave Simone my license
a couple of months ago.

00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,409
She was always getting her
fakes snatched by bouncers,

00:19:05,476 --> 00:19:08,379
so I gave her
my expired one.

00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:11,816
Bouncers only ever
look at the birth date.

00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:13,684
We look alike.

00:19:13,751 --> 00:19:16,587
Kind of, in ways,

00:19:16,654 --> 00:19:18,890
like her nose and...

00:19:18,956 --> 00:19:22,393
parts of her
chin and cheeks.

00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,496
And we both have nice butts.

00:19:25,563 --> 00:19:29,200
But... that's not on a license.

00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:32,103
Do you know anyone
who'd want to hurt Simone?

00:19:34,138 --> 00:19:35,973
No way.

00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,375
She was so nice,

00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,243
super cool...

00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,579
all about fun.

00:19:41,646 --> 00:19:43,014
Any guys involved?

00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,316
Yeah.

00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:47,185
Mostly guys.

00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:48,553
Guys with money.

00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:50,154
Like who?

00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:51,856
I never met
any of them.

00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:53,491
They weren't long-term things.

00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:55,726
She would just go out
with them to party.

00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:57,628
She have sex with these guys?

00:19:57,695 --> 00:19:59,697
No, no sex.

00:19:59,764 --> 00:20:01,332
She would just use them
to get drunk

00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:03,534
and hang out at penthouses.

00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:04,869
Where was Simone last night?

00:20:04,936 --> 00:20:06,237
I don't know,

00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:09,107
but she always starts off
her night at the same place:

00:20:09,173 --> 00:20:11,209
The Gold Square on Sunset.

00:20:11,275 --> 00:20:12,977
That place is a dive.

00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:15,146
That's not the kind of place
to find rich guys.

00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:18,483
It was kind of
a confidence builder for her.

00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:20,751
Simone was a star in there.

00:20:20,818 --> 00:20:24,122
She'd always come out with
at least a couple numbers.

00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:27,458
CURTIS:
Gold Square Bar, gold wad
of tissue in her purse--

00:20:27,525 --> 00:20:29,727
figured it was worth
checking out.

00:20:29,794 --> 00:20:31,062
Looks like a
bar napkin.

00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:34,432
Yeah, that's been shaped,
rolled and twisted.

00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,969
Las Vegas origami.

00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:39,570
Pretty corny.

00:20:39,637 --> 00:20:41,806
Probably work on me.

00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:42,807
(chuckles):
That bad, huh?

00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,876
(chuckles)

00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:46,711
Here we are.

00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:50,615
"Carey."

00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:53,151
Looks like this Carey
was hitting on the vic.

00:20:53,217 --> 00:20:55,987
Maybe in more ways than one.

00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:16,908
(footsteps approaching)

00:21:19,277 --> 00:21:20,478
Hey.

00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:22,146
Um, I got your
DNA results.

00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:24,048
Yeah, and?

00:21:24,115 --> 00:21:26,451
Well, there were two
donors on the nose straw.

00:21:26,517 --> 00:21:29,287
There was one unknown female
and one half-known male.

00:21:29,353 --> 00:21:30,955
So a sibling match?

00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:33,524
Yeah.

00:21:33,591 --> 00:21:36,561
Greg, the male is the brother
of Demitrius James.

00:21:40,164 --> 00:21:41,866
SANDERS:
<i>One guy decided</i>
<i>not to run away.</i>

00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,968
<i>He picked up a rock</i>

00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:46,304
<i>and started coming</i>
<i>at me with it.</i>

00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,272
(Marla wailing, sobbing)

00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:49,640
MARLA JAMES:
<i>You didn't run over a mob,</i>

00:21:49,707 --> 00:21:51,175
<i>you ran over one boy!</i>

00:21:51,242 --> 00:21:52,944
My boy!

00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,178
AARON JAMES:
<i>How tough you feel</i>

00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:56,514
<i>when your not</i>
<i>in your big SUV, huh?</i>

00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:59,183
Asked you a
question, killer.

00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,219
<i>I asked you a question!</i>

00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,595
GRISSOM:
This image was captured
on a cell phone at the scene.

00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:13,232
We believe that that
is Aaron James.

00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:14,633
That fuzzy blob?

00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,970
We also found evidence
of Aaron James inside the limo.

00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:20,272
Well, I hope it's
better than this photo.

00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,407
It's DNA, along with traces
of cocaine

00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,042
on a rolled-up $100 bill.

00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,178
Which doesn't place
him in the limo.

00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:28,514
That bill could
have been brought
in there by anyone.

00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,884
We found a pattern in the blood
on the seat next to the vic's.

00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,520
It doesn't match the clothes
from the limo driver or Drops',

00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:37,222
so there was at least one
other passenger in that limo,

00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,458
and we need
to question Aaron James.

00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:43,962
This city just paid Aaron James
and his mother $2.5 million

00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,864
because you ran
his brother over.

00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,066
Are you trying to find a way
to give them more money?

00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,902
I'm just trying to do my job.
You want
to talk

00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:52,037
to Aaron James, give me
more than snot on a bill,

00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,405
and a dot on a crummy photo.

00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:56,308
This is a PR
nightmare in
the making.

00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,743
We still don't have
a murder weapon.

00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,411
Aaron James could be
destroying evidence right now.

00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,079
All right, first of all,
stop talking.

00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,581
You're off
the case.

00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:04,817
Everything he touched
gets reprocessed.

00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,485
There's nothing
wrong with my work.
Okay. I know that.

00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,387
It's just standard procedure.
Oh, procedure.

00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:11,089
Open your mouth one more time,
and you're on suspension.

00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:14,092
I'm trying to avoid a
harassment suit here.

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,694
This is cover-our-ass time.

00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:19,198
Keep me apprised.

00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:21,033
This would have been
so much easier

00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,103
if you had been the black guy.

00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:30,976
We're looking
for Carey Corville.

00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:34,179
That's me, Bob.

00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,785
M... Hottest cops
I've ever seen.

00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:42,020
Yeah, might be
the hottest chicks
I've seen all week.

00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,356
You guys are here to get me,
take me away.

00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,991
Pat him down.

00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:49,628
Am I under arrest for something?

00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:51,530
Yeah, that depends.

00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,665
This your idea of romance?

00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,935
Can't really arrest me for that.

00:23:57,002 --> 00:24:01,106
We found it
in Simone Molinez's purse.

00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:03,609
She kept that, for real?

00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,077
Oh, it's on.

00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:07,012
What are you guys doing with it?

00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,747
She's dead.

00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,618
Oh.

00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:15,687
Well, listen, I don't know
nothing about none of that.

00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:18,290
Sh-She was breathing
when I left her.

00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:21,693
(loud chatter,
music playing)

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,228
That's sweet.

00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,331
But I have a boyfriend.

00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,802
So you say.

00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,637
Come on.

00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:33,839
I'm not that hard up.

00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:36,508
Look, she
didn't like me.

00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:37,810
So what?

00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,578
On to the next who will.

00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,680
You've got a GMC truck?

00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:43,182
Where is it?

00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:10,976
(sniffing)

00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:14,880
Disinfectant.

00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:22,454
Seat's damp.

00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:32,731
WILLOWS:
Hey, Carey,

00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:34,600
there's blood
in your car.

00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,168
Yeah, it's, uh,
my boy, Scotty.

00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:37,369
He had a nosebleed.

00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:38,537
Scotty who?

00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:39,772
Scotty Brittington?

00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:42,441
WILLOWS:
Well, it's a hell
of a lot of blood

00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:44,009
for a nosebleed.

00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:46,044
Looks more consistent
with the body of

00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,646
a bloody girl.

00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,281
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:50,482
CURTIS:
Where would we find

00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,984
your boy Scotty?

00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,220
I don't know. He's kind of hard
to get a hold of easy.

00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,388
Address and phone.

00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:57,489
We're going to see

00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,925
what your boy has to
say about this blood.

00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:02,194
Until then,
you're coming with us.

00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,305
(phone ringing)

00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:15,808
(phone beeps on)

00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,042
This is Catherine.

00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:18,310
CURTIS:
It's me.

00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:20,078
Scott Brittington wasn't at any

00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:22,481
of his usual haunts,
so I checked the hospitals,

00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:23,949
and guess what?

00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,317
He was admitted last night

00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:27,419
with a severe puncture wound
to his shoulder.

00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:29,688
He told the staff
it was a work injury,

00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:30,923
but during surgery,

00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,925
they extracted
a bullet fragment.

00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,326
Interesting line of work.

00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:36,628
Doc thinks someone tried
to dig it out

00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,397
to avoid police notification,

00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,332
which actually made it
a lot worse.

00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:43,769
(screaming)

00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:46,638
Dude, it's...

00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:47,940
Keep going.

00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,476
I can't go to the hospital
with a bullet in me.

00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:51,710
Cops'll be all over us.

00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,479
(squishing)
(screaming)

00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:55,147
It's all right, man.
I got it, I got it.

00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:57,349
(panting)

00:26:57,416 --> 00:27:00,719
Needle-nose pliers aren't
exactly a fine surgical tool.

00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,888
CURTIS:
Yeah, that's for sure.

00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,690
WILLOWS:
You talk to Scott?

00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:07,893
Well, I'm on my way
to his room right now.

00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,394
WILLOWS:
If he's anything
like his friend,

00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,130
I'll sure he'll give you plenty
of attitude.

00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,798
Let me know
what he has to say.

00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:14,299
DOCTOR: All right,
let's call it, people.

00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,168
We've done
what we could.

00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:18,337
I don't think
it's going to be much.

00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:24,676
(computer beeping)

00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:32,184
(computer beeping)

00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,264
(computer beeping)

00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,433
(sighs)

00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,037
(beeps)

00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,040
(beeps)

00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:57,876
WILLOWS:
<i>A .38 fragment recovered</i>
<i>from a suspect in my homicide</i>

00:27:57,943 --> 00:27:59,611
matched a .38 bullet
that Greg found

00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,879
near the strip
club drive-by.

00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:02,047
SIDLE:
So the guys

00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:03,882
in the GMC truck got
into a shoot-out

00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:05,284
with the guys
in the limo.

00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,020
(tires squealing)

00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:11,957
(gunfire)

00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,091
(screaming)

00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:16,295
Tie score--
one dead on each side.

00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,563
Over what?

00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,598
Why were these guys
shooting each other up?

00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:21,733
It's got to be about the girl.

00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,902
Her DNA matched the unknown
female contribution

00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:25,404
on the hundred dollar bill,

00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:27,272
so, she was in the limo.

00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:29,007
But that bill doesn't put her
in there

00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:30,309
any more than it does Aaron.

00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,543
No, but it proves

00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,946
she was with Aaron
at some point in the night.

00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,414
Wait a minute.

00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:37,583
Why would Simone even be
with those guys?

00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:38,650
Because of Drops.

00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,185
He knows everybody
in the club scene,

00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:41,220
especially the party girls.

00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,788
He could have
picked her up anywhere.

00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:45,457
Simone blows off the broke guys
to party with the rich guys.

00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:46,625
The broke guys feel dissed,

00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:48,393
so they track down the limo
and retaliate.

00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,795
Yeah. Yeah.

00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:53,332
And somewhere in between,
Simone just gets... tossed.

00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,701
All right, how are we going
to prove any of this?

00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:57,603
I mean, we're not going
to get any answers

00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:58,904
from the suspect in the truck.

00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:00,072
He's lawyered up.

00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:01,573
So is Drops.

00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,509
And the Undersheriff isn't
letting anyone talk to Aaron.

00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:07,279
What about the seat belt
adjuster you found?

00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:08,714
No match to the truck.

00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:10,616
Doesn't even have
seat belt adjusters.

00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:11,884
What about the limo?

00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,185
SIDLE:
It's not a GMC.

00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,753
It's a Lincoln Continental.

00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,624
Yeah, but maybe not entirely.

00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,225
Stretch limos
are custom-made.

00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,327
You take a Lincoln
Continental, cut it apart,

00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:24,897
stretch it with whatever
parts you have available:

00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,366
Ford, Chrysler,
General Motors,
doesn't matter.

00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:42,648
Looks like the same
belt adjuster.

00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,883
This one's missing.

00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:50,189
This blood has to be
from the shooting.

00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:56,295
This is from something else.

00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:59,164
There shouldn't be blood
on this part of the seat belt.

00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:02,734
Think the Undersheriff
will let us talk to Aaron now?

00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,938
If the DNA matches
Simone Molinez's,

00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:09,007
anyone that was in this limo
is up for murder.

00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:12,678
The, uh, Undersheriff
won't have a choice.

00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,414
OFFICER MITCHELL:
<i>From the hood to the hills.</i>

00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,649
Didn't take him long
to spend the taxpayers' money.

00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:19,585
CURTIS:
Hey, knock it off.

00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:23,021

Mrs. James?

00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:25,090
(music playing)
Oh, hell, no.

00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,525
I got company.

00:30:26,592 --> 00:30:28,527
We have a warrant
to search the premises.

00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:31,029
A warrant? A warrant for what?!

00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:32,831
We also need
to speak to Aaron.

00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:35,367
Oh, we're not talking to nobody.

00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,436
This is harassment!

00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,173
That could be considered
assaulting an officer.

00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,909
Let's not make this harder
than it has to be.

00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:50,215
Somebody get me a phone!

00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:52,484

corner pocket.

00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:54,386
Mr. James?

00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,590
We need to talk
to you down at
the station.

00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,599
You're not under arrest.

00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:08,967
We just want
to talk.

00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,036
Yeah, right.

00:31:20,248 --> 00:31:22,384
I hear soda water
works better.

00:31:24,252 --> 00:31:27,122
What'd work better is if I took
it out and shot it.

00:31:27,189 --> 00:31:30,492

on the 11:00 news.

Yeah.

00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:36,531
Yeah, his attorney's
on his way.

00:31:36,598 --> 00:31:38,533

press conference?

00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,203
Yeah, I'm on my way there now.

00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:42,704
How do I look?

00:31:42,771 --> 00:31:44,106
Like fresh meat.

00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:48,477
Oh. Hope I hold
my temper as well as you.

00:31:48,543 --> 00:31:50,779

00:32:03,325 --> 00:32:06,962
and the guest rooms,
no sign of any weapons, but...

00:32:07,028 --> 00:32:09,765
I did find these
in the laundry room.

00:32:09,831 --> 00:32:11,967
Look familiar?

00:32:15,504 --> 00:32:17,806
Yeah. Any trace of blood?

00:32:17,873 --> 00:32:20,008
Nothing obvious.
They were just washed.

00:32:20,075 --> 00:32:21,743
(sniffs)
They smell like bleach.

00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,979
Great. What about the, uh,

00:32:24,045 --> 00:32:25,414
the hoodie in that
cell phone picture?

00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,848
It looked like Aaron
was wearing one.

00:32:26,915 --> 00:32:29,284
Yeah, it's still wet.
Aaron wears his clothes baggy.

00:32:29,351 --> 00:32:31,820
He probably keeps
them out of the dryer
so they won't shrink.

00:32:46,268 --> 00:32:48,270
Looks like the little
hood left us something.

thousand asses in this town.

that places my client

00:37:15,804 --> 00:37:17,105
(camera beeps)

00:37:17,172 --> 00:37:19,808
BRASS:
This bruise on
Simone Molinez's body

00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:22,144
matches the heel
of your buddy Champ's

00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,945
dress shoe.

00:37:27,449 --> 00:37:30,218
Man, forensics
be jammin' a brother up.

00:37:30,285 --> 00:37:32,254
No doubt. And you saw him do it.

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,989
Look, he was just trying to show

00:37:34,055 --> 00:37:36,491
a potential investor
a good time, that's all.

00:37:36,558 --> 00:37:38,126
The boy got a short fuse.

00:37:38,193 --> 00:37:40,262
All right.
Whatever.

00:37:40,328 --> 00:37:42,631
Why don't you really
hook up my man?

00:37:42,697 --> 00:37:45,400
Champ, come on, man.

00:37:45,467 --> 00:37:47,235
What's wrong with you, man?
She's a lady.

00:37:47,302 --> 00:37:48,403
Let me out the car!

00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,605
Oh, you want out?

00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,608
Get out.

00:37:54,843 --> 00:37:56,111
Tell the driver to stop.

00:37:56,178 --> 00:37:57,279
We're in a hurry!

00:37:57,345 --> 00:37:58,980
You want out,
you get out now!

00:37:59,047 --> 00:38:00,849
No!

00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:02,250
(screaming)
Hey!

00:38:02,317 --> 00:38:04,119
So, what, he pushed
her out of the car

00:38:04,186 --> 00:38:05,821
because she wouldn't
have sex with Aaron?

00:38:05,887 --> 00:38:07,856
Champ thought it was a bad look.

00:38:07,923 --> 00:38:09,624
Bad? Bad for what?

00:38:09,691 --> 00:38:11,860
Champ gets a bonus
when business is good.

00:38:11,927 --> 00:38:14,196
You got booze, bling, girls,

00:38:14,262 --> 00:38:16,098
guns and drugs in a limo.

00:38:16,164 --> 00:38:18,133
Would you call that doing
legitimate business?

00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,201
Yeah.

00:38:19,267 --> 00:38:20,635
So, um...

00:38:20,702 --> 00:38:22,504
what's a few
scrapes and bruises

00:38:22,571 --> 00:38:24,139
on this girl got
to do with me?

00:38:24,206 --> 00:38:26,608
Yeah, a few scrapes
and bruises, a broken wrist

00:38:26,675 --> 00:38:28,543
dislocated shoulder,
broken neck--

00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:31,680
add it up: it equals death.

00:38:31,747 --> 00:38:33,014
Death? Wait a minute, no way.

00:38:33,081 --> 00:38:35,150
See, first of all,
that limo was turtlestepping' it

00:38:35,217 --> 00:38:37,018
down the block.
It's like fallin' off a bike.

00:38:37,085 --> 00:38:39,287
Yeah, maybe so, if she wasn't
tangled up in the seat belt.

00:38:39,354 --> 00:38:41,356
What, you didn't hear her
dragging on the street?

00:38:42,724 --> 00:38:43,992
The speakers were on blast.

00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:45,627
I couldn't even
hear my cell phone

00:38:45,694 --> 00:38:46,828
and that was
on vibrate.

00:38:46,895 --> 00:38:49,064
My client has
corroborated your evidence.

00:38:49,131 --> 00:38:50,165
Are we free to go?

00:38:50,232 --> 00:38:53,502
What? No!

00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,972
I'm charging you with the
murder of Scott Brittington.

00:38:57,038 --> 00:38:58,473
Scott... Who?

00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,075
The guy you shot.

00:39:00,142 --> 00:39:02,544
Okay, we already went over that.

00:39:02,611 --> 00:39:03,678
Champ was the shooter.

00:39:03,745 --> 00:39:05,280
Yeah, so you say.

00:39:05,347 --> 00:39:07,315
But you're the only
one in the limo

00:39:07,382 --> 00:39:10,018
with a registered .38.
And you didn't

00:39:10,085 --> 00:39:12,587
toss that gun after you used it,
you gave it to Aaron.

00:39:12,654 --> 00:39:14,089
DROPS:
Trust me, son,
you don't want

00:39:14,156 --> 00:39:16,091
to be here when
the cops come, okay?

00:39:16,158 --> 00:39:18,593
Here, take the ratchet,
and make it disappear.

00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,761
Take the ratchet!

00:39:19,828 --> 00:39:21,596
Don't worry about it;
I got you covered.

00:39:22,631 --> 00:39:23,932
BRASS:
<i>Aaron leaves the scene</i>

00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:27,836
<i>with your murder weapon,</i>
<i>and you take his spot</i>

00:39:27,903 --> 00:39:30,005
<i>like he was never there.</i>

00:39:30,072 --> 00:39:32,007
Captain Brass,

00:39:32,074 --> 00:39:34,276
I've seen the ballistics report.

00:39:34,342 --> 00:39:36,411
The shots
fired from inside

00:39:36,478 --> 00:39:39,147
the limo were fired second.

00:39:39,214 --> 00:39:41,149
That's textbook self-defense.

00:39:45,554 --> 00:39:47,322
"Textbook self-defense."

00:39:47,389 --> 00:39:49,724
Told you, forensics be
jammin' a brother up.

00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:51,526
I'll take my chances
with the jury.

00:39:51,593 --> 00:39:53,395
I'm going to see your
arms behind your back

00:39:53,462 --> 00:39:54,663
sooner than you think.

00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:56,098
Counselor.

00:39:58,133 --> 00:40:01,236
(door opens and closes)

00:40:01,303 --> 00:40:03,705
And all this time I thought
I was paying you too much.

00:40:03,772 --> 00:40:05,407
Give me some.

00:40:14,516 --> 00:40:17,352
The DA tells me
you requested

00:40:17,419 --> 00:40:19,755
he go easy on Aaron James.

00:40:19,821 --> 00:40:21,990
Yeah.

00:40:22,057 --> 00:40:24,192
He's getting
a suspended sentence.

00:40:24,259 --> 00:40:26,294
Released on his
own recognizance.

00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,114
GRISSOM:
<i>Tell me something.</i>

00:40:46,181 --> 00:40:48,383
If the kid's brother
hadn't died,

00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,285
would you have done the same?

00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,322
I don't know. I just, uh...

00:40:56,391 --> 00:40:58,026
You think it's wrong?

00:40:59,428 --> 00:41:00,962
Doesn't matter what I think.
