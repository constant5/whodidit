00:00:17,409 --> 00:00:18,644
(sniffing)

00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:19,912
I don't smell it.

00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:20,980
Ever since
Father started

00:00:21,046 --> 00:00:22,548
leaving the church
open at night.

00:00:22,615 --> 00:00:24,483
The church has gotten
a lot more use.

00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,519
Yeah, as an orgy house
and a toilet.

00:00:26,585 --> 00:00:29,788
No. People come in at all hours
of the night to pray.

00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:32,925
"Dear Jesus, please keep me from
blowing all my laundry money

00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:35,661
on the nickel slots
at the Gas 'N' Go."

00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:42,134
Oh, somebody's done
their business

00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:43,702
right here
next to Jesus.

00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:45,771
Oh, no, not again.

00:00:58,284 --> 00:01:02,254
Right here on the eve
of the apocalypse, a miracle.

00:01:15,734 --> 00:01:17,736
(garbled radio transmissions)

00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:24,677
Somebody went to a lot of
trouble to get her up there.

00:01:24,743 --> 00:01:26,712
Why? I wonder.

00:01:26,779 --> 00:01:29,415
Somebody had a grudge
against the church

00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:30,649
or somebody
in the church.

00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:34,053
Or maybe they were
just mad at God.

00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,525
Well, Jesus died
for our sins.

00:01:39,592 --> 00:01:42,695

You know, if you
think about it,

00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,460
this is one of the oldest ways
to kill somebody.

00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,930
Considering where we are,
highly symbolic.

00:02:35,997 --> 00:02:37,165
All right, what do you got?

00:02:37,232 --> 00:02:38,466
How we gonna do this?

00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,634
Well, the two-by-four is tied

00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,470
to the scaffold
with a single loop.

00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,974
There is an empty pulley
up here.

00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,575
We could lower her down
with that.

00:02:47,642 --> 00:02:48,910
That's probably how the killer

00:02:48,977 --> 00:02:50,845
got her up there
in the first place.

00:02:50,912 --> 00:02:52,747
Then he ditched the rope.

00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:55,216
I wouldn't be surprised to find
it around here someplace.

00:02:55,283 --> 00:02:56,651
First things first.

00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:00,255
We'll use our rope;
I'll run it through this pulley,

00:03:00,322 --> 00:03:02,490
and then let you
take the weight.

00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,493
I'll mark the rope,
cut the knot;

00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,129
down she goes.

00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:17,706
Ready?

00:03:17,772 --> 00:03:18,940
Yeah.

00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:20,508
You take the weight.
I'll cut it on three.

00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,509
One,

00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,345
two,

00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,679
three.

00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,348
Got it?

00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,615
Yeah, ready.

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,285
Oh.

00:03:30,352 --> 00:03:31,419
Whoever tied her up there

00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:33,488
had to be strong enough
to deadlift her weight.

00:03:33,555 --> 00:03:34,622
Yeah, either that
or highly motivated.

00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:36,925
You know how it is

00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:38,927
once somebody's
adrenaline gets pumping.

00:03:38,994 --> 00:03:40,829
Feel like they
can do anything.

00:03:47,869 --> 00:03:50,005
All right, that's it.

00:04:00,548 --> 00:04:01,750
(siren whoops)

00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:05,020
(garbled radio transmission)

00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,356
Look, shouldn't Father
Frank be here by now?

00:04:08,423 --> 00:04:10,692
Father Frank lives
in manana land.

00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,694
Well, I'm sure
he's on his way.

00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:14,663
Father Frank is
a wonderful priest.

00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:17,232
And since he's been here,
church attendance has tripled.

00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,300
Among our female congregants.

00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:21,202
(sighs)
And we have

00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,004
sponsors for
our building fund.

00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:24,305
One sponsor.

00:04:24,372 --> 00:04:25,273
The Big Hombre?

00:04:26,408 --> 00:04:28,176
The car dealership.

00:04:28,243 --> 00:04:30,478
Time of death
was sometime

00:04:30,545 --> 00:04:33,148
between 2:00
and 4:00.

00:04:33,214 --> 00:04:34,649
Nasty head wound.

00:04:34,716 --> 00:04:38,053
She was actively bleeding,
so she had to have been alive

00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:40,655
when she was tied
to the cross.

00:04:40,722 --> 00:04:42,891
Good chance she died
of suffocation.

00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:44,592
Like Jesus.

00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,561
Well, Jesus had
a footrest.

00:04:46,628 --> 00:04:49,764
He was able to lift himself up
and take short breaths.

00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,433
But this young lady was hanging.

00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,735
Her pectoral muscles

00:04:53,802 --> 00:04:55,303
probably became
paralyzed

00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,672
and the intercostal muscles
were unable to function.

00:04:57,739 --> 00:05:00,508
She was able to breathe out,
but not breathe in.

00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:03,144
<i>In time, carbon dioxide</i>
<i>built up</i>

00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:04,479
<i>in her lungs and bloodstream.</i>

00:05:04,546 --> 00:05:06,181
<i>Edema built up</i>
<i>in the chest cavity.</i>

00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:07,849
<i>Heart went into fibrillation.</i>

00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,050
(heart beating rapidly)

00:05:09,117 --> 00:05:12,954
Gruesome torture in any century.

00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,789
WILLOWS:
In 18 years, this is
my first crucifixion.

00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:19,060
In a Catholic church
with no crucifixes.

00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:20,195
GRISSOM:
I imagine the priest

00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:22,230
is a resurrection
theologian,

00:05:22,297 --> 00:05:24,933
as opposed to
a crucifixion theologian.

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,534
They believe in forgiveness

00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:27,769
rather than penance.

00:05:27,836 --> 00:05:29,571
We could all use
a little forgiveness.

00:05:29,637 --> 00:05:31,039
She was bleeding
from her head wounds,

00:05:31,106 --> 00:05:33,141
and the beating didn't
take place up there.

00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:36,511
WILLOWS:
Well, the blood pool
is gravitational.

00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,848
And the blood trail...

00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,787
...the tips are pointing
towards the statue.

00:05:45,854 --> 00:05:48,256
She was bleeding on the way in.

00:05:48,323 --> 00:05:52,160
I'll backtrack, see if I can
find the point of origin.

00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,229
Excuse me, huh?

00:05:56,865 --> 00:05:58,600
I-I got to go, Father.
I'll see you.

00:05:58,667 --> 00:05:59,634
Okay.

00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:01,403
I'm the pastor of the church.

00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:02,570
Hey, Captain.

00:06:02,637 --> 00:06:03,605
He'll take
care of you.

00:06:03,672 --> 00:06:05,607
Thank you.

00:06:05,674 --> 00:06:07,676
Father Frank Berlin.

00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,077
I'm Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.

00:06:09,144 --> 00:06:11,179
You were supposed to be here
45 minutes ago. Where you been?

00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,248
Been serving breakfast
at the shelter.

00:06:13,315 --> 00:06:14,916
I understand there's been
a death in the church.

00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:16,184
How soon before
you're out of here?

00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,953
Father, this is
a murder investigation.

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,355
It's just
we hold Mass at 10:00.

00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:21,623
Yeah, I understand.

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,426
Sorry, Father, but, uh,
this is a crime scene.

00:06:24,492 --> 00:06:26,227
You're not gonna get
your church back for a while.

00:06:26,294 --> 00:06:28,430
Is it all right if we set Mass
in the community center?

00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:30,332
Yeah, sure, I have
no problem with that.

00:06:30,398 --> 00:06:32,467
FRANK:
Sister, would you
tell the choir

00:06:32,534 --> 00:06:33,835
we'll be singing
"In Paradisum."

00:06:33,902 --> 00:06:35,570
I'll take care
of it, Father.

00:06:35,637 --> 00:06:38,073
We sing the hymn for the dead
every time we have a death.

00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:40,075
Sisters couldn't
identify the victim,

00:06:40,141 --> 00:06:42,043
so we'll need you
to take a look.

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,878
Sorry. I didn't mean
to sound cavalier.

00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,348
It's just we've had over
half a dozen deaths this year.

00:06:46,414 --> 00:06:48,216
We've never had to close
the church.

00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,651
That's because,
in this neighborhood,

00:06:49,718 --> 00:06:52,287
those derelicts and drug addicts
died of heatstroke, overdose

00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:54,089
and old age.

00:06:54,155 --> 00:06:56,057
None of them were strung
up in the rafters.

00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,693
Father Frank Berlin,
this is Gil Grissom

00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,362
from the crime lab.

00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,735
Do you recognize her?

00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,676
I'll take that
as a no.

00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,078
Excuse me, Father.

00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,780
Is that blood
on your jacket?

00:07:20,582 --> 00:07:22,651
We had a fight in the shelter.

00:07:22,717 --> 00:07:23,918
I had to break it up.

00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,520
We're gonna need
to take your clothes.

00:07:25,587 --> 00:07:27,322
No, you can't have my clothes.

00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:28,556
BRASS:
Then you have to come

00:07:28,623 --> 00:07:30,025
downtown to the police station.

00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:31,259
If you're gonna
say Mass later,

00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:35,030
you have to change
anyway, right?

00:07:35,096 --> 00:07:37,966
Greg, go with him,
collect his clothing.

00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,372
Is it a bigger sin to lie
if you're a priest?

00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,775
I hope so.

00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:21,142
(strikes match)

00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,012
This one's for you, Sam.

00:08:35,657 --> 00:08:37,192
When will I get those back?

00:08:37,258 --> 00:08:39,094
I only have
three sets of clothes.

00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,796
Respectfully, Father, a woman's
been murdered in your church

00:08:41,863 --> 00:08:43,264
and your clothes
have blood on them.

00:08:43,331 --> 00:08:45,266
You're lucky you're
not under arrest.

00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:32,020
Hey!

00:13:32,087 --> 00:13:34,022
Hey, I found it.

00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:38,660
Rope, nails, hammers,
everything.

00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,435
Oh, yeah.

00:14:05,754 --> 00:14:07,756
Something I said?

00:14:07,822 --> 00:14:09,691
No, dear.

00:14:10,825 --> 00:14:12,894
I didn't offend you,
did I?

00:14:12,961 --> 00:14:15,764
Did I say something offensive
to you as a Catholic?

00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,533
I'm not really a Catholic
anymore, you know.

00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,970
I suppose I practice a kind
of secular Catholicism

00:14:22,037 --> 00:14:25,006
that involves ritualizing
certain aspects of everyday life

00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,741
and imbuing them with

00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:30,378
a spiritual intensity
they might not
otherwise possess,

00:14:30,445 --> 00:14:32,914
but I don't want to put
too fine a point on it.

00:14:35,216 --> 00:14:38,720
And the rosary beads
are a part of that.

00:14:38,787 --> 00:14:40,855
This belonged to my mother.

00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:45,727
Take a look
at this pattern.

00:15:01,977 --> 00:15:03,945
Five series of
ten beads each

00:15:04,012 --> 00:15:05,246
representing the
"Five Mysteries"

00:15:05,313 --> 00:15:07,882
separated by five
"Our Father" beads.

00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,952
Who would strangle someone
with a rosary?

00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:12,253
Probably the same person

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,589
who would crucify someone
in a church.

00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:35,773
St. Jude.

00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,742
Patron saint of lost causes.

00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:39,477
And that's why it's
so difficult to keep

00:15:39,544 --> 00:15:41,245
the local kids from
defacing this statue.

00:15:41,312 --> 00:15:44,081
Did you run those tests
on my clothes?

00:15:44,148 --> 00:15:46,584
We did. The blood
on your clothes is not a match

00:15:46,651 --> 00:15:47,818
to the blood on the victim.

00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:49,487
So do I get my clothes back?

00:15:49,554 --> 00:15:50,688
Not just yet.

00:15:51,722 --> 00:15:53,024
I have a favor to ask.

00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,225
You steal my clothes

00:15:54,292 --> 00:15:56,093
and then you want to ask
for another favor?

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,496
We'd like permission
to search your rectory

00:15:58,563 --> 00:15:59,897
and the nun's apartments.

00:15:59,964 --> 00:16:01,966
Just because
someone dies in our church

00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:03,834
doesn't mean we have anything
to do with it.

00:16:03,901 --> 00:16:06,170
Well, we want to eliminate you
as suspects.

00:16:06,237 --> 00:16:08,773
That's what you said
when you fingerprinted us,

00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:10,908
and the truth is you don't
have enough for a warrant.

00:16:10,975 --> 00:16:12,043
You're right.

00:16:12,109 --> 00:16:13,511
But you have nothing to hide.

00:16:15,546 --> 00:16:17,114
You really think
if I killed a woman,

00:16:17,181 --> 00:16:19,684
I'd leave her body
in my own church?
It's so obvious

00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,986
that it obviates suspicion.

00:16:22,053 --> 00:16:24,121
Mmm, I'm not that smart.

00:16:24,188 --> 00:16:25,856
Well, that's hardly
the argument to make.

00:16:25,923 --> 00:16:27,525
What is it you're looking for?

00:16:27,592 --> 00:16:28,793
Rosaries.

00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:32,430
Mr. Grissom,
I didn't realize you were here.

00:16:32,496 --> 00:16:33,464
That's all right, Sister.

00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:35,633
We don't have to hide anything
from Mr. Grissom.

00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,069
Uh, he's here
to confiscate our rosaries.

00:16:38,135 --> 00:16:39,704
I don't know where mine are.
Do you?

00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,006
It's probably in the sacristy.

00:16:42,073 --> 00:16:43,774
We'll need all the rosaries.

00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:46,210
Uh, even Sister Elizabeth's?

00:16:46,277 --> 00:16:49,013
She's not going to like that.

00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,481
Happy day for Sister Elizabeth,

00:16:50,548 --> 00:16:52,216
for she delights

00:16:52,283 --> 00:16:54,819
in what she dislikes.

00:16:57,355 --> 00:17:01,359
♪ ♪

00:17:16,207 --> 00:17:19,877
The killer used materials
from the church:

00:17:19,944 --> 00:17:23,080
the rope, the 2x4s,
and one of these hammers.

00:17:23,147 --> 00:17:25,316
I just haven't
found it yet.

00:17:25,383 --> 00:17:27,885
But all this was
in the same utility closet.

00:17:27,952 --> 00:17:29,654
He didn't bring
anything with him?
Hmm-mm.

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,589
What does this
feel like to you?

00:17:31,656 --> 00:17:33,691
Inside job.

00:17:33,758 --> 00:17:35,560
I mean maybe one
of the construction workers

00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:38,062
wasn't a fan
of the victim.

00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:39,597
I'm going to call Brass.

00:17:46,137 --> 00:17:47,104
What?

00:17:47,171 --> 00:17:48,206
I've solved your case.

00:17:48,272 --> 00:17:49,941
Bull.
No, cow.

00:17:50,007 --> 00:17:51,976
Those hairs you found
on the scaffold:

00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:53,077
not human.

00:17:53,144 --> 00:17:54,345
Bovine.

00:17:56,447 --> 00:17:57,848
They have red cows?

00:17:57,915 --> 00:18:00,017
You betcha, partner.
Guernseys.

00:18:00,084 --> 00:18:02,553
Maybe the scaffold
was used somewhere else.

00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,588
Like on a farm.

00:18:03,654 --> 00:18:05,756
Or maybe it was
secondary transfer.

00:18:05,823 --> 00:18:07,225
Well, you can
take care of that.

00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,960
I've done all
the heavy lifting.

00:18:09,026 --> 00:18:10,294
As usual.

00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:17,869
Oh, hi.
Hi.

00:18:17,935 --> 00:18:19,303
I saw you
at the crime scene.

00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,572
I thought you were on desk duty
until the coroner's inquest.

00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:23,407
Yeah, I was starting
to get a serious case

00:18:23,474 --> 00:18:26,010
of trucker butt so I told
Grissom that I wanted to, uh,

00:18:26,077 --> 00:18:27,879
get back out with the team.

00:18:27,945 --> 00:18:30,982
Yeah, there's no
therapy like work.

00:18:31,048 --> 00:18:33,284
You doing okay?

00:18:33,351 --> 00:18:35,486
Yeah.

00:18:35,553 --> 00:18:37,722
Well, hang in there.

00:18:37,788 --> 00:18:39,557
All right.

00:18:43,594 --> 00:18:45,463
(sighs)

00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:50,034
Mr. Bombay.

00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:52,670
We found your keys
at the scene of our murder.

00:18:52,737 --> 00:18:55,106
We also found
your car close by.

00:18:57,608 --> 00:18:59,277
I don't know anything
about a murder.

00:18:59,343 --> 00:19:01,712
Well, we also found
a wad of bloody tissues

00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:03,447
in the front seat
of your vehicle.

00:19:03,514 --> 00:19:04,916
What... what's going on?

00:19:04,982 --> 00:19:06,417
You tell me.

00:19:06,484 --> 00:19:09,153
I loaned my car to a woman
I work with last night.

00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,521
She sings at my club.

00:19:10,588 --> 00:19:12,823
Charlotte Danville.
Is she all right?

00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,192
Was this your friend?

00:19:20,264 --> 00:19:21,999
Yeah, that's her.

00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:24,936
Who did... who did this to her?

00:19:25,002 --> 00:19:26,470
Why did she borrow your car?

00:19:26,537 --> 00:19:28,472
She had to...
She had to do another set

00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:29,707
and needed
to change her clothes.

00:19:29,774 --> 00:19:31,142
Doesn't she have her own car?

00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:32,543
She had a Lexus.

00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,045
Totally tricked out.

00:19:34,111 --> 00:19:35,213
So why did she borrow yours?

00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,314
I don't know.

00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,715
I didn't get the whole story.

00:19:37,782 --> 00:19:39,050
She seemed upset.

00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:41,185
She was talking to this guy.

00:19:41,252 --> 00:19:44,355
<i>I had to send a waitress over</i>
<i>to remind her</i>

00:19:44,422 --> 00:19:46,290
<i>that she was</i>
<i>getting paid to sing.</i>

00:19:46,357 --> 00:19:48,125
You ever see the
guy move forward?

00:19:48,192 --> 00:19:50,828
<i>Yeah, it's that guy</i>
<i>that sells cars on television.</i>

00:19:50,895 --> 00:19:53,497
Uh... Cody White.

00:19:53,564 --> 00:19:54,865
The Big Hombre.

00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:57,335
I mean, but a lot of guys
came in to see Charlotte.

00:19:57,401 --> 00:19:59,170
I mean, it's not like
she slept around or anything.

00:19:59,237 --> 00:20:01,138
I tried.

00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:02,907
Can I go now?

00:20:02,974 --> 00:20:05,243
Not without an alibi.

00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:06,611
Where did you
spend the night?

00:20:06,677 --> 00:20:08,980
I allowed myself to succumb
to the pleasures of Donna.

00:20:09,046 --> 00:20:11,449
And she kept me up
to the wee hours of the morning

00:20:11,515 --> 00:20:13,618
gratifying her abnormal lust.

00:20:18,022 --> 00:20:20,057
She sleeps with her eyes open.

00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,432
Yeah, this is it.

00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:30,935
Well, this car's already
been cleaned and detailed.

00:20:31,002 --> 00:20:32,236
It's ready to be sold.

00:20:32,303 --> 00:20:34,405
Well, I guess it's
a change of plans.
No.

00:20:34,472 --> 00:20:36,173
No, there's not
a change of planes.

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,009
This baby's staying
right where she sits.

00:20:38,075 --> 00:20:39,777
I'm not in the
give-away-the-car-to-cops
business.

00:20:39,844 --> 00:20:41,913
I'm in the sell-the-car-
to-willing-victims business.

00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:43,848
Mr. White, we have
a court order

00:20:43,915 --> 00:20:45,750
to examine this car
for evidence related

00:20:45,816 --> 00:20:47,351
to the murder of
Charlotte Danville.

00:20:47,418 --> 00:20:48,920
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Charlotte?

00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:50,888
She and I are friends.

00:20:50,955 --> 00:20:51,956
I... I knew her.

00:20:52,023 --> 00:20:53,591
Yeah, I know.
We have a witness

00:20:53,658 --> 00:20:55,526
who places you arguing
with her last night.

00:20:55,593 --> 00:20:57,895
You may be one of the last
people to see her alive.

00:20:57,962 --> 00:20:59,096
Yeah.

00:20:59,163 --> 00:21:00,431
I was with her.

00:21:00,498 --> 00:21:02,967
I went to see Charlotte
to give her the car.

00:21:03,034 --> 00:21:04,569
Helped Charlotte
through

00:21:04,635 --> 00:21:06,304
a rough patch,
but lately she been ducking me.

00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,905
What am I supposed to do now?

00:21:07,972 --> 00:21:09,640
Walk home?

00:21:09,707 --> 00:21:11,275
I'll give you
money for a cab.

00:21:11,342 --> 00:21:13,411
Tomorrow, we'll see about
getting you a good used car.

00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:15,079
Some junker.

00:21:15,146 --> 00:21:16,914
Thanks a lot.

00:21:16,981 --> 00:21:18,416
Some friend you are.

00:21:18,482 --> 00:21:19,684
Take your damn car.

00:21:21,886 --> 00:21:25,823
Guess that's what you get
for helping a friend, you know.

00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:29,093
Look, I feel awful about
about Charlotte. I really do.

00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,328
But I'll tell you this:

00:21:30,394 --> 00:21:32,263
whatever happened
happened after I got this car.

00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,999
Well, I feel awful too, but
the car is coming with me.

00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:38,102
WILLOWS:
<i>No sign of forced entry.</i>

00:21:40,338 --> 00:21:42,840
Does this look
like the condo

00:21:42,907 --> 00:21:44,876
of a woman who
sings weekends

00:21:44,942 --> 00:21:46,510
at the Gorilla Room?

00:21:46,577 --> 00:21:49,413
Looks like the fight
started here.

00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,484
Got some blood, some
here on the pillow.

00:21:53,551 --> 00:21:55,820
But no blood trail.

00:21:55,887 --> 00:21:58,589
The real beating took place
in the bushes at the church.

00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,458
This was just the opening act.

00:22:00,524 --> 00:22:03,661
Explains the bloody tissue found
in the backseat of Hugo's car.

00:22:03,728 --> 00:22:07,798
I guess she got a bloody
nose or a fat lip here,

00:22:07,865 --> 00:22:11,335
ran out and used Hugo's car
to go to the church.

00:22:11,402 --> 00:22:14,405
CURTIS:
The killer must have
followed her

00:22:14,472 --> 00:22:16,140
and caught up
with her there.

00:22:19,277 --> 00:22:21,412
She had quite the career.

00:22:27,184 --> 00:22:28,185
Sofia.

00:22:30,187 --> 00:22:31,188
You recognize that guy?

00:22:31,255 --> 00:22:34,392
Father Frank.

00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:37,628
I mean, a lot
younger, obviously.

00:22:37,695 --> 00:22:40,731
You know him?

00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:41,933
No.

00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:43,000
That's the Big Hombre.

00:22:43,067 --> 00:22:45,603
He sells cars on TV.

00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,905
She's known these guys forever.

00:22:57,548 --> 00:22:58,916
Here's a rosary.

00:23:00,284 --> 00:23:02,186
Looks like
it's broken.

00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:09,393

00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,636
giving up Charlotte

00:32:52,703 --> 00:32:55,139
was the sacrifice he made
to join the Church.

00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:10,621
I need to ask you
a few more questions.

00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:14,124
Go ahead and ask the question
you really want to know.

00:33:14,191 --> 00:33:16,594
Who killed Charlotte Danville?

00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,199
I did.

00:33:24,835 --> 00:33:27,972
(sighs)

00:33:34,415 --> 00:33:35,516
(elevator bell dings)

00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:37,384
Single malt express
is leaving the station

00:33:37,451 --> 00:33:38,986
as soon as
I get home.

00:33:39,053 --> 00:33:42,256
Look, I know it sounds nuts,
but this is not the way

00:33:42,323 --> 00:33:44,358
a resurrection theologian would
kill his pregnant mistress.

00:33:44,425 --> 00:33:45,526
He confessed.

00:33:45,593 --> 00:33:47,394
He's a Catholic.
They're full of guilt.

00:33:47,461 --> 00:33:48,996
He's a priest,
for God's sakes.

00:33:49,063 --> 00:33:50,831
That's the whole point
of the priesthood.

00:33:50,898 --> 00:33:52,366
No sleeping around.

00:33:52,433 --> 00:33:53,867
More energy for

00:33:53,934 --> 00:33:55,869
good works and
noble deeds.

00:33:55,936 --> 00:33:57,438
Now you find me some evidence

00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,640
to exonerate the good Father,
and we'll talk.

00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:12,453
WILLOWS:
Hi. I heard Grissom wants us
to keep digging.

00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:14,088
This Charlotte's car?

00:34:14,154 --> 00:34:15,856
Yeah.

00:34:15,923 --> 00:34:19,126
I found blood smears,
but they've been washed.

00:34:19,193 --> 00:34:23,030
Cody said he repo'd
the car at the club

00:34:23,097 --> 00:34:24,932
and drove it back to the lot.

00:34:24,999 --> 00:34:27,268
There shouldn't be any blood
in this car.

00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:29,236
Well, unless Father Frank
drove it that night,

00:34:29,303 --> 00:34:30,971
and we've got no reason
to believe

00:34:31,038 --> 00:34:32,139
that he did.

00:34:32,206 --> 00:34:33,574
Which brings us back to Cody.

00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:35,709
Do you have a big enough sample
for DNA?

00:34:35,776 --> 00:34:37,177
No.

00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:39,813
But I do know

00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,583
one spot the
detailers never hit.

00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:50,157
Bloody shoe impression
on the brake pedal.

00:34:50,224 --> 00:34:51,959
Well, I'll compare it
to Father Frank's shoes.

00:34:52,026 --> 00:34:54,662
If it's not a match, I'll get
a warrant for Cody's shoes.

00:34:54,728 --> 00:34:56,764
I'll get a sample
of the blood to DNA.

00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:00,634
CODY:
I'm trying to shoot
a commercial here,

00:35:00,701 --> 00:35:02,770
so I don't see
why this can't wait.

00:35:02,836 --> 00:35:03,938
I can't even read this,

00:35:04,004 --> 00:35:06,607
so why don't you tell me
what it is that you want?

00:35:06,674 --> 00:35:08,642
Your boots and a DNA sample.

00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:09,877
Well, there's my wife.

00:35:09,944 --> 00:35:11,111
Candy!

00:35:11,178 --> 00:35:13,814
Get my damn lawyer
on the phone now.
What's wrong?

00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:16,250
Would... would you just do it,
please?

00:35:16,317 --> 00:35:17,184
We found rust-colored fur

00:35:17,251 --> 00:35:19,253
on the scaffold
at the crime scene.

00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,921
CURTIS:
Well, I'll call

00:35:20,988 --> 00:35:24,458
a judge and get him to amend
the warrant to include the vest.

00:35:24,525 --> 00:35:26,694
J-J-J-J-J-J... Hold on
for a minute, all right?

00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,128
Would you just hang on?

00:35:28,195 --> 00:35:30,464
Hey, I found these
in his office.

00:35:30,531 --> 00:35:32,666
Positive for blood
on the right sole.

00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:34,068
Where's my wife?

00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:35,603
Candy?!

00:35:35,669 --> 00:35:37,304
Well, Big Hombre,

00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:39,607
it looks like
you're going to the hoosegow.

00:35:39,673 --> 00:35:42,109
(panting)

00:35:42,176 --> 00:35:45,312
So, you don't like crucifixes,
but maybe you made an exception

00:35:45,379 --> 00:35:47,982
when you found out
Charlotte was pregnant, hmm?

00:35:48,048 --> 00:35:51,485
GRISSOM:
Father...

00:35:51,552 --> 00:35:53,320
I want you to take
a look at this.

00:36:01,962 --> 00:36:03,964
I'm responsible for her murder.

00:36:04,031 --> 00:36:06,367
I could never do that.

00:36:06,433 --> 00:36:07,635
In my world, Father,

00:36:07,701 --> 00:36:09,670
you're either guilty
or innocent.

00:36:09,737 --> 00:36:12,139
Well, in my world,
you can be both.

00:36:12,206 --> 00:36:14,308
The blood on your boot
is Charlotte's.

00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:16,710
Your footprint was found
on the brake pedal

00:36:16,777 --> 00:36:18,879
of her car
in blood.

00:36:18,946 --> 00:36:22,349
The lab also matched hair
from your fur vest

00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:24,318
to hair found dried

00:36:24,385 --> 00:36:26,854
in the blood of the
victim in the church.

00:36:26,921 --> 00:36:29,390
(laughs)

00:36:29,456 --> 00:36:33,427
Now matter how much evidence
you have, I'm the Big Hombre.

00:36:33,494 --> 00:36:37,331
I get whatever I want,
including store-bought justice.

00:36:37,398 --> 00:36:39,833
And yet, the one thing
you couldn't get

00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,169
was Charlotte's love.

00:36:42,236 --> 00:36:43,737
Yeah, like I said,

00:36:43,804 --> 00:36:47,541
I only saw her that last time
to get the car.

00:36:47,608 --> 00:36:51,011
♪ Come the day you're mine ♪
(men scatting along)

00:36:51,078 --> 00:36:55,382
♪ Come the day you're mine ♪

00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:58,452
♪ Come the day you're ♪

00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:03,023
♪ Mine. ♪

00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:05,759
(applause)

00:37:05,826 --> 00:37:07,394
Thanks for coming.

00:37:07,461 --> 00:37:10,064
Come on. I'd come every night
if you wanted me to.

00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:12,600
You know that.

00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:14,868
Here's the car back.

00:37:14,935 --> 00:37:17,271
You really are a good friend.

00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:20,708
No, you gave her the car.

00:37:20,774 --> 00:37:23,377
You gave her everything.

00:37:23,444 --> 00:37:26,580
And how did she pay you back?

00:37:26,647 --> 00:37:28,616
She dumped you
for your best friend.

00:37:28,682 --> 00:37:32,419
(keys jangling)
Here's the car back.

00:37:32,486 --> 00:37:33,921
And I'm moving.

00:37:33,988 --> 00:37:35,422
Why would you do that?

00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:36,824
I can't do this anymore.

00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,626
It's not right.

00:37:38,692 --> 00:37:40,895
I'm in love with another man.

00:37:40,961 --> 00:37:42,663
I'm sorry, Cody.

00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,331
That's what you got for me?

00:37:44,398 --> 00:37:45,933
You got, you're sorry?

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,534
I'm sorry, too.

00:37:48,535 --> 00:37:50,771
GRISSOM:
We, uh,

00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:52,873
found a letter
you wrote to the Bishop

00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,441
and pulled it
off your computer.

00:37:54,508 --> 00:37:58,312
"The spirit has left
my vocation.

00:37:58,379 --> 00:38:00,381
"I've crossed a line
in my discipline

00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:02,850
"and committed an act
that has left me unfit

00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:04,685
for the priesthood."

00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:08,923
What act is that?

00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:12,593
Putting my love for Charlotte
above my love for God.

00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,428
So, you were leaving
the priesthood?

00:38:14,495 --> 00:38:16,530
I was leaving
because I loved her,

00:38:16,597 --> 00:38:20,067
and I wanted to be with her
in all ways.

00:38:20,134 --> 00:38:22,136
Her dying doesn't change that.

00:38:22,202 --> 00:38:23,337
I still love her.

00:38:23,404 --> 00:38:25,239
I talked to the Monsignor.

00:38:25,306 --> 00:38:27,975
It's a complicated process,
but I told him I'm leaving.

00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:29,276
Are you sure?

00:38:29,343 --> 00:38:31,178
I prayed about it.

00:38:31,245 --> 00:38:33,647
What came to me was
that God is love.

00:38:33,714 --> 00:38:36,183
Wherever there is true love,
God is, as well.

00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,053
I have to follow my heart.

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,388
And we only made love once,

00:38:41,455 --> 00:38:43,424
but in the wake of that,

00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,627
I found the husband in me,

00:38:46,694 --> 00:38:48,662
the father in me.

00:38:48,729 --> 00:38:51,632
I wanted
to be those men for her.

00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:54,435
And I always loved her.

00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:57,538
And what if the baby
wasn't yours?

00:38:57,605 --> 00:38:59,707
A child is always welcome.

00:38:59,773 --> 00:39:02,843
Yeah, I decorated her condo,
you know that?

00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,145
I bought her that car.

00:39:05,212 --> 00:39:08,182
Special-ordered the paint
to match the color of her eyes.

00:39:08,249 --> 00:39:11,485
She didn't care as long
as she had a place to stay.

00:39:11,552 --> 00:39:12,886
That's all she cared about.

00:39:12,953 --> 00:39:15,889
She cared about Father Frank,
didn't she?

00:39:15,956 --> 00:39:18,926
Did you suspect that she
was leaving you for him?

00:39:18,993 --> 00:39:21,629
Should have, but I didn't.

00:39:24,431 --> 00:39:25,933
What are you doing here?

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,669
Look, I'm sorry about
the dress, all right?

00:39:28,736 --> 00:39:30,571
I have to get back to the club.

00:39:30,638 --> 00:39:31,906
Wait, wait, wait.

00:39:31,972 --> 00:39:34,241
I want to know who
you're leaving me for.

00:39:34,308 --> 00:39:35,943
No.
(slaps)

00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,011
(groaning)

00:39:37,077 --> 00:39:38,445
What is that?

00:39:41,181 --> 00:39:42,349
It's Frank, isn't it?

00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:43,517
(shouting):
<i>Isn't it?</i>

00:39:43,584 --> 00:39:47,087
(groaning)
It's always
been Frank.

00:39:48,422 --> 00:39:50,291
(choking)

00:39:50,357 --> 00:39:51,725
You know, he doesn't think

00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:52,927
you did it.

00:39:52,993 --> 00:39:54,862
But I think

00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:56,730
that you know
who killed Charlotte.

00:39:56,797 --> 00:40:00,768
He came to the church that day
to confess, didn't he?

00:40:00,834 --> 00:40:05,105
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

00:40:05,172 --> 00:40:07,541
My last confession
was two weeks ago.

00:40:07,608 --> 00:40:09,777
I lied to my wife seven times.

00:40:09,843 --> 00:40:13,247
I cheated an old lady
out of a classic car.

00:40:13,314 --> 00:40:16,283
And I killed my best friend
for cheating on me with you.

00:40:17,718 --> 00:40:19,620
You know I can't discuss that.

00:40:21,855 --> 00:40:25,292
You know, in Vegas,
it's routine

00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,629
to hear the most heinous sins,
and as a priest, you listen,

00:40:28,696 --> 00:40:30,965
and in Christ's name,
you forgive.

00:40:31,031 --> 00:40:33,367
I knew she'd go running to him.

00:40:33,434 --> 00:40:37,304
She'd always run back to Frank,
and I knew he wouldn't be there.

00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:39,540
He was never there.

00:40:44,912 --> 00:40:47,214
Is that when
you thought of
crucifying her

00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:49,316
in Frank's church?

00:40:54,488 --> 00:40:56,957
I don't know
how I came up with that.

00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,896
You know, Frank always
used to talk

00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:03,898
about the problem of human evil.

00:41:03,964 --> 00:41:05,933
How...

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,869
you better watch out
'cause it'd come into you

00:41:08,936 --> 00:41:10,938
in times of despair.

00:41:15,175 --> 00:41:18,746
Something terrible
came into me that night.

00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:52,179
I loved Charlotte more
than anything.

00:41:52,246 --> 00:41:56,016
The paternity test came back.

00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:58,085
You were
the father.

00:42:00,387 --> 00:42:02,523
You killed your own baby.

00:42:06,527 --> 00:42:10,231
(sobbing)

00:42:34,688 --> 00:42:36,991
You were my friend.

00:42:38,926 --> 00:42:40,661
You should have come
to me like a man.

00:42:48,702 --> 00:42:51,572
Can you forgive him?

00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:53,841
That's Christ's mandate.

00:42:53,908 --> 00:42:55,876
You know what that means.

00:42:55,943 --> 00:42:57,878
You have no choice.
