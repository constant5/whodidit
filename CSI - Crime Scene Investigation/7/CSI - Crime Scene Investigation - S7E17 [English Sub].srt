00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,301
No, thanks.
I've... I've already got it.

00:11:57,368 --> 00:12:00,238
I'm not seeing
any evidence
of other people.

00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:04,142
It's possible that
the basketball player snapped,

00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,309
killed the cheerleader,

00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:06,978
took her body and drove off.

00:12:07,044 --> 00:12:08,246
What about the busted door?

00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:11,015
He starts out
the big romantic...

00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:15,620
Oh, don't break your
million-dollar foot.
Shh.

00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:19,090
SANDERS:
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>things went south.</i>

00:12:19,157 --> 00:12:20,124
Ryan.

00:12:20,191 --> 00:12:21,125
Stop. I told you

00:12:21,192 --> 00:12:22,593
Come on.
I want to wait
till prom.

00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,162
It's gonna be fun.
Stop it!

00:12:24,228 --> 00:12:26,631
She pushes him off,
makes a run for it.

00:12:26,697 --> 00:12:29,267
But he realizes that
an attempted rape charge

00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,968
might crash a Duke scholarship,

00:12:31,035 --> 00:12:34,472
so he chases her down
and bashes her head in.

00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:36,808
(phone rings)

00:12:36,874 --> 00:12:38,042
Stokes.

00:12:38,109 --> 00:12:39,677
Oh, hey, Wendy.

00:12:39,744 --> 00:12:41,312
Really?

00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:42,580
Yeah, thanks.

00:12:42,647 --> 00:12:45,082
How does your theory
account for the fact

00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:46,651
that all the blood's Ryan's?

00:12:46,717 --> 00:12:49,420
It doesn't.

00:12:49,487 --> 00:12:51,022
Okay.

00:12:51,088 --> 00:12:53,825
Let's say I'm
a Lovers Lane rapist.

00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:55,293
I stalk them.

00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:57,128
I want me a high school
cheerleader.

00:12:57,195 --> 00:12:58,896
What's the first thing
I do?

00:12:58,963 --> 00:13:00,465
You take out
the basketball player.

00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:03,167
Grab her, take her
somewhere more private.

00:13:03,234 --> 00:13:05,102
Why take Ryan's body?

00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:09,540
People...

00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:11,375
let's spiral out.

00:13:36,434 --> 00:13:40,238
♪ ♪

00:13:58,956 --> 00:14:01,158
(camera shutter clicking)

00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,694
Greg.

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,964
Accident debris.

00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,565
Broken turn
signal light.

00:14:08,632 --> 00:14:10,634
Lots of pieces
of grille

00:14:10,701 --> 00:14:13,537
for a physical match.

00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,038
Shoes match
the description

00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:18,508
of the sneakers Megan Cooper
was wearing last night.

00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:22,980
So far, the only blood I found
was on the shoes.

00:14:28,051 --> 00:14:30,954
This road has almost no traffic
at night.

00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:32,489
Take a look at this.

00:14:33,657 --> 00:14:36,226
GRISSOM:
Looks like
acceleration marks.

00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:38,028
Start out heavy,
and then they fade out

00:14:38,095 --> 00:14:39,529
as the vehicle
gains momentum.

00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:45,168
They're in a direct line
with the accident debris.

00:14:45,235 --> 00:14:47,804
That tells me it's probably
related to the impact.

00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:49,740
If Megan was
hit by a car,

00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,808
hard enough to knock her
out of her own shoes,

00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,177
I doubt she just walked away
from this.

00:14:54,244 --> 00:14:56,780
So far there's no reports
of anyone fitting Megan's

00:14:56,847 --> 00:14:59,283
description being admitted
to area hospitals.

00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:03,120
I had a friend once that got hit
by this big-ass van.

00:15:03,186 --> 00:15:05,689
Knocked him like
200 feet in the air.

00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:30,714
Nick!

00:15:30,781 --> 00:15:31,648
Yeah?

00:15:31,715 --> 00:15:34,017
Straight ahead of you
about 20 yards.

00:15:36,753 --> 00:15:38,689
Yeah!

00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:40,757
Yeah, I got her.

00:15:43,894 --> 00:15:44,728
Is she still alive?

00:15:44,795 --> 00:15:47,364
Barely.

00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,804
Yeah...

00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,273
Okay...
All right.

00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,941
Right, yeah, yeah, hold on.

00:15:58,008 --> 00:15:59,309
We found Megan.

00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,044
She's alive.

00:16:01,111 --> 00:16:02,980
She was found on the side
of the road

00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,348
near the high school.

00:16:04,414 --> 00:16:06,683
She's apparently victim
of a hit-and-run car accident.

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,352
She's in a very
serious condition

00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:09,519
and has been taken

00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:10,754
to Desert Palm
Hospital.

00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:12,589
And what about Ryan?

00:16:12,656 --> 00:16:14,057
We haven't found him yet.

00:16:14,124 --> 00:16:15,225
We're still looking.

00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:17,260
Go ahead.

00:16:17,327 --> 00:16:18,695
Let's go.

00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:29,940
Uniforms found the van
on patrol.

00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:31,208
They called it in.

00:16:31,274 --> 00:16:33,577
I cleared it, waited for you
guys to open it up.

00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:45,622
Front end's intact.

00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:48,692
No damage,
no paint transfer.

00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:49,926
There's no signs of an accident.

00:16:49,993 --> 00:16:51,194
The keys are still
in the ignition.

00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,397
There's no blood
on the driver's seat.

00:16:53,463 --> 00:16:54,931
CURTIS:
Which means Ryan

00:16:54,998 --> 00:16:56,266
probably wasn't driving,

00:16:56,333 --> 00:17:00,237
because his blood was
all over the field.

00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:07,611
(camera shutter clicks)

00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,791
Body dump?

00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:32,336
Where's the body?

00:17:32,402 --> 00:17:34,438
(camera shutter clicks)

00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,508
Hospital food.

00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:40,677
Oh.
The best I could do.

00:17:40,744 --> 00:17:42,913
Any word?

00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,681
Not yet.

00:17:44,748 --> 00:17:46,149
You know Megan.

00:17:46,216 --> 00:17:47,851
She's a fighter.
She'll pull through this.

00:17:47,918 --> 00:17:49,920
Thank you, Charlie.
Thank you.

00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,455
You've always been
very good to her.

00:17:51,521 --> 00:17:52,522
Excuse me.

00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:54,324
I'm Nick Stokes
with the Crime Lab.

00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:55,792
Oh, Charlie, he's the one

00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:56,827
that found Megan.

00:17:56,893 --> 00:17:57,828
Thank you.

00:17:57,894 --> 00:17:59,596
You're very welcome.

00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:00,998
I left your mom
a message.

00:18:01,064 --> 00:18:02,499
I wanted to ask you
a few questions.

00:18:02,566 --> 00:18:03,533
You mind if I...

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,635
steal him
for a minute?

00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:06,103
Sure.

00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:09,473
I understand you and Megan
were pretty close, huh?

00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:12,275
We live next door
to each other.

00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,144
I drive her
to school every day,

00:18:14,211 --> 00:18:15,846
home after
cheerleading practice.

00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:17,781
You wait that whole time?

00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:20,317
Don't cheerleaders
work out for, like, hours?

00:18:20,384 --> 00:18:22,286
No, I'm, I'm on the squad.

00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:23,553
Oh.

00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,988
Oh, okay.

00:18:25,055 --> 00:18:26,723
Cute girls, short skirts.

00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,292
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.

00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:29,693
(chuckles)

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,962
Did you wait for her after
the ballgame the other night?

00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:34,331
I don't usually see her
after Friday night games.

00:18:34,398 --> 00:18:35,832
She catches a ride home
with Ryan.

00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:38,969
Hey, Charlie,

00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:41,738
since you guys
are so close

00:18:41,805 --> 00:18:44,975
you'd know if somebody had it in
for her, wouldn't you?

00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:47,744
The only person who was ever
rude to Megan was Ryan.

00:18:47,811 --> 00:18:48,879
How rude?

00:18:48,945 --> 00:18:50,580
Ryan was a dog.

00:18:50,647 --> 00:18:52,716
And the only person that
wouldn't believe that was Megan.

00:18:58,322 --> 00:19:00,757
High school kid
with a van.

00:19:00,824 --> 00:19:03,160
We could have half
the senior class in here.

00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:05,796
Yeah, a bunch of minors
that won't be in the system.

00:19:05,862 --> 00:19:07,097
That'll be helpful.

00:19:16,173 --> 00:19:18,108
Ryan is six feet.

00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:20,877
Whoever was driving

00:19:20,944 --> 00:19:23,513
must have adjusted the seat.

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,781
(grunts)

00:19:24,848 --> 00:19:26,717
Hello.

00:19:26,783 --> 00:19:28,452
What you got?

00:19:28,518 --> 00:19:29,553
I got a cell phone.

00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,988
(camera shutter clicks)

00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:37,394
Battery's dead, so I don't
know who it belongs to.

00:19:37,461 --> 00:19:40,597
But something tells me
that pink is not Ryan's color.

00:19:40,664 --> 00:19:42,332
I don't know.

00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:46,069
I think he might be
always thinking pink.

00:19:50,173 --> 00:19:51,708
If these all belong

00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,111
to one girl, she's got nothing
left to wear.

00:19:54,177 --> 00:19:56,947
You know, when
I was in college,

00:19:57,014 --> 00:19:59,116
I had this boyfriend

00:19:59,182 --> 00:20:00,550
and I thought we were
monogamous.

00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:04,154
And one night, during the
post-coital panty search,

00:20:04,221 --> 00:20:06,657
he handed me a pair of
underwear that wasn't mine.

00:20:06,723 --> 00:20:08,058
Ooh.

00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,393
How'd he explain that one?

00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,862
He said they belonged
to his sister.

00:20:11,928 --> 00:20:13,497
Yeah, right.
I know.

00:20:13,563 --> 00:20:16,833
Let's hope your taste in men
has improved since then.

00:20:18,235 --> 00:20:20,437
There's a large
rectangular blood pool

00:20:20,504 --> 00:20:22,572
at the center
of the sleeping bag...

00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:27,377
with several satellite
transfers.

00:20:29,913 --> 00:20:32,249
At each corner...

00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:33,817
a four-plus-one pattern

00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:38,121
consistent with transfer
from bloody hands,

00:20:38,188 --> 00:20:42,626
indicating the body was carried
on the sleeping bag.

00:20:54,037 --> 00:20:56,006
Between ten and 20 semen stains.

00:20:57,975 --> 00:21:00,243
Some overlaid
with blood.

00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,334
Ugh.

00:21:24,401 --> 00:21:27,337
You okay?

00:21:35,612 --> 00:21:38,415
Phthirus Pubis.

00:21:38,482 --> 00:21:39,916
Yeah, crabs.

00:21:39,983 --> 00:21:42,653
I am buying Lindsey
a chastity belt.

00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,322
There's a hole
in the metal

00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:46,390
to let the urine pass.

00:21:46,456 --> 00:21:47,758
So theoretically,
she could still get them.

00:21:47,824 --> 00:21:50,360
You are so creepy sometimes.

00:21:50,427 --> 00:21:56,066
You know, the incidence of STDs
in monogamous couples is slim.

00:21:56,133 --> 00:21:58,068
Unless one someone arrives
at the party with them.

00:21:58,135 --> 00:22:00,270
So assuming
they both have pubic lice,

00:22:00,337 --> 00:22:04,508
if either Megan or Ryan
were assaulted,

00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:06,109
they would have given them
to their attacker.

00:22:06,176 --> 00:22:07,944
A sex pervert
with an STD?

00:22:08,011 --> 00:22:10,380
That's not going
to narrow it down.

00:22:10,447 --> 00:22:13,016
Yeah, but once they jump
to the fresh host,

00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,886
crabs contain the DNA
of the receiver and the giver.

00:22:15,953 --> 00:22:18,322
Did the parents agree
to an SAE kit?

00:22:18,388 --> 00:22:20,557
Yes.

00:22:24,361 --> 00:22:25,762
You rang?

00:22:25,829 --> 00:22:26,763
Yes.

00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,231
Found the owner
of that cell phone.

00:22:28,298 --> 00:22:29,800
Megan.

00:22:29,866 --> 00:22:32,402
Nope. Sheila Latham.

00:22:32,469 --> 00:22:34,271
What is
Megan's best friend's cell phone

00:22:34,338 --> 00:22:35,305
doing in the front seat

00:22:35,372 --> 00:22:36,840
of her boyfriend's van?

00:22:36,907 --> 00:22:38,375
♪ If that's your boyfriend,
if that's your boyfriend ♪

00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:41,011
BOTH:
♪ He wasn't last night. ♪

00:22:42,045 --> 00:22:43,714
Hi, hi, I'm sorry I'm late,

00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,617
but, you know, the sun
goes down on missing kids

00:22:46,683 --> 00:22:47,985
and it's news.

00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:50,654
I know this sounds awful,
but all I keep thinking is:

00:22:50,721 --> 00:22:52,289
thank God it wasn't Sheila.

00:22:52,356 --> 00:22:53,590
Doesn't make you a bad person.

00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:58,095
(coin clanking)
Oh, this, this,
this thing is so broken.

00:22:58,161 --> 00:23:00,063
There's a trick
to it.
Ah.

00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,765
I lost two dollars in there.

00:23:01,832 --> 00:23:04,568
This is Vegas, baby.
That's nothing.

00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:06,069
(can clatters)

00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:07,237
Thank you.

00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:08,238
Voila.

00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:09,873
Let's go to my office,
okay?

00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,742
Look, I know you have
questions for her, but,

00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:13,910
you know, Sheila almost lost
her best friend yesterday

00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:15,545
and she's still
a little out of it.

00:23:15,612 --> 00:23:18,248
No, I get it, and I appreciate
you bringing her in.

00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:19,616
Hey, Sheila.

00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:21,018
See, she's exhausted.

00:23:21,084 --> 00:23:22,019
Oh, poor baby.

00:23:22,085 --> 00:23:23,020
Sheila, honey.

00:23:23,086 --> 00:23:24,921
It's time to wake up.

00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:27,891
Captain Brass is here.

00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,693
Sheila?

00:23:30,594 --> 00:23:33,163
Sheila?

00:23:35,532 --> 00:23:36,466
We got a 421!

00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:38,502
Somebody run next door

00:23:38,568 --> 00:23:39,836
and get the squad medics.
Wake up, please.

00:23:39,903 --> 00:23:40,937
(sobbing)

00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:42,172
Sheila, honey.

00:23:46,544 --> 00:23:48,113
I'll tell you
it's been a banner week

00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:50,382
for teens and police.

00:23:50,448 --> 00:23:52,584
Two kids disappear;
one we can't find;

00:23:52,651 --> 00:23:54,552
one may not make it
out of surgery;

00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:57,922
and another one ends up
dead in custody.

00:23:57,989 --> 00:23:59,624
I mean, I don't want
to make this about me,

00:23:59,691 --> 00:24:01,359
but I need to know
my office is not responsible.

00:24:01,426 --> 00:24:02,494
Did you hit her over the head?

00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,063
Because COD is
epidural hemorrhage

00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:08,299
caused by a blow
to the top of the skull.

00:24:09,701 --> 00:24:11,903
The blood clot pushed
against the brain,

00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:14,506
which compressed
the respiratory centers.

00:24:14,572 --> 00:24:17,409
Her brain stopped telling her
body to breathe, and she died.

00:24:17,475 --> 00:24:18,443
How recent
was the injury?

00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,844
I extracted

00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:22,547
about 150cc's
of partially clotted blood.

00:24:22,614 --> 00:24:24,015
Would have taken
at least a day

00:24:24,082 --> 00:24:26,084
to form, maybe longer.

00:24:26,151 --> 00:24:27,719
Wait, so...
Sheila suffered the blow

00:24:27,786 --> 00:24:31,056
around the same time
that Megan and Ryan were, um...

00:24:31,122 --> 00:24:32,424
well, whatever they were.

00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,525
Did her mother
mention the injury?

00:24:33,591 --> 00:24:34,959
Injury? No.
Well,

00:24:35,026 --> 00:24:37,128
that's not the only secret
she was keeping.

00:24:37,195 --> 00:24:40,765
She swallowed something
rather unusual,

00:24:40,832 --> 00:24:41,866
and she had crabs.

00:24:41,933 --> 00:24:43,268
Well, I can guess
where she got those

00:24:43,335 --> 00:24:45,070
and who she
gave them to.

00:24:45,136 --> 00:24:47,072
What is it that she swallowed?

00:24:49,007 --> 00:24:51,776
Looks like a memory
card from a camera.

00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:22,140
♪ ♪

00:25:47,832 --> 00:25:49,434
Looks like the metal connectors

00:25:49,501 --> 00:25:52,203
got pretty gacked up
by the stomach acids.

00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,673
Let's see if it still downloads.

00:25:58,109 --> 00:25:59,577
Ah, we're in luck.

00:26:02,013 --> 00:26:03,948
I'm guessing
that's your missing

00:26:04,015 --> 00:26:05,650
basketball player.

00:26:05,717 --> 00:26:06,651
Yeah.

00:26:06,718 --> 00:26:07,719
In the equipment shed.

00:26:07,786 --> 00:26:09,587
Look, I don't even know
how I got crabs.

00:26:09,654 --> 00:26:11,456
GIRL:
You got them from humping
everything that moved,

00:26:11,523 --> 00:26:12,457
you big loser.

00:26:12,524 --> 00:26:13,558
Now, read.

00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:14,926
What are you so mad about?

00:26:16,961 --> 00:26:19,664
Come on, guys.
It's cold in here!

00:26:19,731 --> 00:26:21,099
You could
at least close the door.

00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:24,102
I, Ryan Lansco...

00:26:25,203 --> 00:26:29,541
...am a diseased subhuman
sex pervert.

00:26:29,607 --> 00:26:33,011
If you do me, you'll go home

00:26:33,078 --> 00:26:35,380
with a souvenir.

00:26:35,447 --> 00:26:37,382
Your own little crab colony.

00:26:37,449 --> 00:26:39,417
My parents
better never see this!

00:26:39,484 --> 00:26:40,485
(scoffing):
Oh, yeah?

00:26:40,552 --> 00:26:42,587
This is going up on YouTube,

00:26:42,654 --> 00:26:45,290
or maybe you'd like to put it
on your FriendAgenda page.

00:26:45,357 --> 00:26:48,660
You put everything else up
there, why not your crotch rot?

00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:49,661
Handheld camera.

00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,330
There's a light in the room.

00:26:52,397 --> 00:26:53,832
Someone opened the door.

00:26:53,898 --> 00:26:56,568
There's got to be more than
one person yanking his chain.

00:26:56,634 --> 00:26:58,536
You know, hang on,
I can give you

00:26:58,603 --> 00:26:59,971
one voice comparison
right now.

00:27:03,842 --> 00:27:06,378
Hi, guys, this is Sheila.

00:27:06,444 --> 00:27:08,413
Guess you missed me,
but if you leave me a message,

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,781
I'll get you back.

00:27:09,848 --> 00:27:11,983
(voice doubled):
Hi, guys, this is Sheila.

00:27:16,888 --> 00:27:18,923
This is going up on YouTube.

00:27:20,792 --> 00:27:23,028
Oh, Sheila.

00:27:23,094 --> 00:27:25,497
So does that make her a victim
or a suspect?

00:27:25,563 --> 00:27:27,565
Maybe both.

00:27:29,401 --> 00:27:33,438
STOKES:
Megan, listen, I know you've
already been through a lot,

00:27:33,505 --> 00:27:34,906
but you may be the only one

00:27:34,973 --> 00:27:36,908
that can tell us
what happened to Ryan.

00:27:36,975 --> 00:27:39,310
Where is he?

00:27:39,377 --> 00:27:42,080
We don't know.

00:27:42,147 --> 00:27:44,082
Let's start with the
last thing you remember.

00:27:45,116 --> 00:27:47,352
We were at the game...

00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:49,421
and I did a perfect hurkey.

00:27:49,487 --> 00:27:52,090
What's a hurkey?

00:27:52,157 --> 00:27:54,993
It's a jump where you go...

00:28:04,002 --> 00:28:06,304
I keep forgetting
I can't move my legs.

00:28:06,371 --> 00:28:07,772
(sobbing)

00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:08,773
Mom,

00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,409
you're not helping.

00:28:11,476 --> 00:28:14,813
Do you remember anything
after the game?

00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:15,880
Anything?

00:28:16,915 --> 00:28:20,885
We won.

00:28:20,952 --> 00:28:22,787
Everybody was happy.

00:28:27,225 --> 00:28:29,094
I remember being really cold.

00:28:33,231 --> 00:28:36,067
There were lights.

00:28:36,134 --> 00:28:37,702
And then...

00:28:41,706 --> 00:28:44,476
Nothing.

00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:46,711
I'm sorry.

00:28:47,746 --> 00:28:49,881
(sobbing)

00:28:56,621 --> 00:28:59,190
EDDIE LANSCO:
If anyone knows anything
about our son,

00:28:59,257 --> 00:29:02,260
please contact
the Las Vegas Police.

00:29:03,294 --> 00:29:05,964
He's a great kid,

00:29:06,031 --> 00:29:08,900
with a bright future
ahead of him,

00:29:08,967 --> 00:29:12,370
and we just want him
home where he belongs.

00:29:15,874 --> 00:29:17,809
"I'm likin' basketball,

00:29:17,876 --> 00:29:19,878
"virgin daiquiris,

00:29:19,944 --> 00:29:22,113
and sweet,
sweet ladies."

00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,050
It's Ryan Lansco's
FriendAgenda page.

00:29:25,116 --> 00:29:26,518
What's a "Hit List"?

00:29:26,584 --> 00:29:29,487
Well, his van was
like a hot sheets motel,

00:29:29,554 --> 00:29:31,222
so I don't think
he's an assassin.

00:29:31,289 --> 00:29:32,390
Wants a password.

00:29:32,457 --> 00:29:34,659
Try "Megan."

00:29:34,726 --> 00:29:37,095
It's too obvious.

00:29:38,396 --> 00:29:41,032
I'll try it anyway.

00:29:44,502 --> 00:29:45,437
(scoffs)

00:29:45,503 --> 00:29:47,005
Men are never
as mysterious

00:29:47,072 --> 00:29:48,873
as women wish they were.

00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,309
"Sheila L.-- couldn't move it.

00:29:51,376 --> 00:29:53,111
"Bunny B. is a honey bee.

00:29:53,178 --> 00:29:56,748
"Diane K. taught me
a thing or two."

00:29:56,815 --> 00:29:57,849
Diane K.

00:29:57,916 --> 00:29:59,951
Diane Kentner is
his photography teacher.

00:30:00,018 --> 00:30:04,889
The fingerprint results
on Ryan's van.

00:30:04,956 --> 00:30:06,524
No hits except
on the back door handle,

00:30:06,591 --> 00:30:08,927
came back to Diane Kentner.

00:30:08,994 --> 00:30:11,029
She was arrested last year
at a demonstration in support

00:30:11,096 --> 00:30:14,299
of an X-rated photography show.

00:30:14,366 --> 00:30:16,601
Now, what's
a photography teacher doing

00:30:16,668 --> 00:30:19,637
touching a student's van?

00:30:19,704 --> 00:30:21,806
Maybe she wanted a ride.

00:30:21,873 --> 00:30:26,811
Ms. Kentner, the car
that hit Megan Cooper

00:30:26,878 --> 00:30:31,116
left a broken
turn signal light

00:30:31,182 --> 00:30:33,918
in the road.

00:30:33,985 --> 00:30:36,421
It's from a Saab.

00:30:36,488 --> 00:30:38,623
Isn't that the car
that you drive?

00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:42,127
Yeah, along with hundreds
of thousands of other Americans.

00:30:42,193 --> 00:30:45,063
Well, we're going to need
to take a look at yours.

00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,365
Get a warrant and you can.

00:30:47,432 --> 00:30:49,434
We also found
your fingerprint

00:30:49,501 --> 00:30:52,604
on the door handle
of the back of Ryan's van.

00:30:52,671 --> 00:30:56,107
Could you explain to me
how that got there?

00:30:56,174 --> 00:30:59,411
Well... Ryan helped me
move an enlarger I got

00:30:59,477 --> 00:31:01,579
for the photo lab
for the school.

00:31:01,646 --> 00:31:04,149
My Saab wasn't big
enough to move it.

00:31:04,215 --> 00:31:06,151
Your name came up

00:31:06,217 --> 00:31:10,755
on, uh, Ryan Lansco's
FriendAgenda page,

00:31:10,822 --> 00:31:13,258
what was called
a "Hit List."

00:31:13,325 --> 00:31:15,860
It's apparently a list
of people that he slept with.

00:31:15,927 --> 00:31:17,862
(laughs)

00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:19,664
Wow.

00:31:19,731 --> 00:31:22,634
If you're under 40 years old
and you teach teenage boys,

00:31:22,701 --> 00:31:26,304
they all want to make
you Mrs. Robinson.

00:31:26,371 --> 00:31:29,541
It's flattering,
but it's fantasy.

00:31:29,607 --> 00:31:32,510
So, you are denying that you had
any sexual relations

00:31:32,577 --> 00:31:34,312
with Ryan Lansco?

00:31:34,379 --> 00:31:37,182
I would never take advantage
of a student.

00:31:37,248 --> 00:31:39,718
Well, we're going to need
to take a DNA sample,

00:31:39,784 --> 00:31:43,088
and <i>that</i> I have a warrant for.

00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,968
My parents
better never see this!

00:31:57,035 --> 00:31:58,370
Oh, yeah?

00:31:58,436 --> 00:31:59,771
This is going up on YouTube.

00:32:01,906 --> 00:32:03,808
The only reflective surface
in this whole frame is

00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:04,809
that cabinet.

00:32:04,876 --> 00:32:06,211
What am I looking at here, Arch?

00:32:06,277 --> 00:32:08,546
I'm thinking
it's two faces.

00:32:08,613 --> 00:32:11,750
Only time I can see it is
when the light hits it.

00:32:13,051 --> 00:32:13,985
Sheila.

00:32:14,052 --> 00:32:16,988
And some dude.

00:32:17,055 --> 00:32:18,957
Some dude named Charlie.

00:32:24,537 --> 00:32:26,539
You can grab a cup of coffee.

00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,812
I know you've waived
your right to counsel.

00:32:32,879 --> 00:32:34,047
I appreciate you
coming in here

00:32:34,113 --> 00:32:35,215
and talking to me, Charlie.

00:32:35,281 --> 00:32:36,983
That means you're
ready to be honest.

00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,952
That's, that's good.

00:32:39,018 --> 00:32:40,887
Because Ryan is
still missing,

00:32:40,954 --> 00:32:43,890
Sheila is now dead,

00:32:43,957 --> 00:32:45,925
Megan is partially
paralyzed,

00:32:45,992 --> 00:32:48,494
and you are digging yourself

00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:51,097
into a pretty deep hole here,
pal.

00:32:51,164 --> 00:32:53,900
I know you were there

00:32:53,967 --> 00:32:55,301
that night in the
equipment shed.

00:32:55,368 --> 00:32:59,739
I have your shoe
impressions at the scene;

00:32:59,806 --> 00:33:01,274
I've got you on film;

00:33:01,341 --> 00:33:06,012
and we found Sheila's cue cards
in the back of her mom's trunk.

00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:07,680
So...

00:33:07,747 --> 00:33:09,282
Where's Ryan?

00:33:09,349 --> 00:33:10,650
I don't know.

00:33:10,717 --> 00:33:13,186
You're an adult, Charlie.

00:33:13,253 --> 00:33:15,188
There's a big difference

00:33:15,255 --> 00:33:17,790
between going to juvie
and going to state prison.

00:33:17,857 --> 00:33:20,093
Big difference.

00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,196
Okay, I'll tell you
what I think happened.

00:33:23,263 --> 00:33:24,797
(clears throat)

00:33:24,864 --> 00:33:27,467
You're in love with Megan,
who's in love with Ryan,

00:33:27,534 --> 00:33:28,668
who's a dog.

00:33:28,735 --> 00:33:29,969
You said so yourself.

00:33:30,036 --> 00:33:32,205
And he gives her crabs.

00:33:32,272 --> 00:33:33,873
But does she
break up with him?

00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,542
No. She goes
right back to him

00:33:35,608 --> 00:33:36,876
after crying on your shoulder.

00:33:36,943 --> 00:33:38,378
Man, that'd piss me off.

00:33:38,444 --> 00:33:41,514
Don't make me
present to a jury

00:33:41,581 --> 00:33:43,650
that you came up
with this plan,

00:33:43,716 --> 00:33:45,118
this little prank,

00:33:45,184 --> 00:33:47,787
and recruited Sheila--
equally afflicted by this--

00:33:47,854 --> 00:33:50,223
and you ran that
boy's head against
a tackling sled.

00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,192
Then when Megan
freaked out
and got scared,

00:33:52,258 --> 00:33:54,894
you just ran her over
and left her for dead.

00:33:54,961 --> 00:33:56,529
No. No, no, that's not
what happened.

00:33:56,596 --> 00:33:58,331
Then you tell me what happened!

00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:02,569
Okay. You're right.

00:34:02,635 --> 00:34:03,970
It started as a prank.

00:34:04,037 --> 00:34:06,339
Sheila and I wrote out
that speech.

00:34:06,406 --> 00:34:09,275
Sheila brought her camera.

00:34:09,342 --> 00:34:12,245
We went down to the field house.

00:34:12,312 --> 00:34:14,614
We knew
they'd be there fooling around.

00:34:16,282 --> 00:34:17,817
What the hell?!
Shut up!

00:34:17,884 --> 00:34:20,186
No, no, no, no.
Megan! Megan!
Get off me!

00:34:20,253 --> 00:34:21,588
Shut up!
Stop it!

00:34:21,654 --> 00:34:24,023
We tied him up.

00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,558
We got him
to read the speech.

00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:27,827
We were just gonna post it
on YouTube.

00:34:27,894 --> 00:34:29,362
What happened?

00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:31,831
He got loose,

00:34:31,898 --> 00:34:34,434
came tearing after us.

00:34:36,336 --> 00:34:38,004
He's coming.
He's coming.

00:34:38,071 --> 00:34:39,873
You two.
(soft grunt)

00:34:39,939 --> 00:34:41,374
Give me
the camera.

00:34:47,447 --> 00:34:48,715
This what you want?

00:34:48,781 --> 00:34:50,650
Huh? Ah, ah, ah.

00:34:51,517 --> 00:34:52,352
Ah, ah...

00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:53,620
(groaning)

00:34:53,686 --> 00:34:54,854
What the heck, man?

00:34:54,921 --> 00:34:57,957
(Sheila gagging and coughing)

00:35:01,094 --> 00:35:03,897
(mock coughs)

00:35:03,963 --> 00:35:05,298
Jerk!

00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:10,770
Ryan? Ryan!

00:35:10,837 --> 00:35:13,806
CHARLIE:
<i>Next thing I know, blood was</i>
<i>just gushing out of his neck.</i>

00:35:21,881 --> 00:35:24,651
I haven't slept.

00:35:24,717 --> 00:35:26,719
I haven't eaten.

00:35:29,756 --> 00:35:33,326
I can't stop playing it
over and over again in my head.

00:35:35,762 --> 00:35:37,764
(sobbing)

00:35:39,699 --> 00:35:42,602
He just went down so fast.

00:35:43,636 --> 00:35:46,639
And-And I was
looking at him.

00:35:46,706 --> 00:35:49,709
And it-it was like
he wasn't Ryan anymore.

00:35:52,478 --> 00:35:53,813
(sobs)

00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,950
Whatever made him Ryan was gone.

00:35:57,016 --> 00:35:58,785
What did you do with the body?

00:35:58,851 --> 00:36:00,987
This is where I suck.

00:36:02,121 --> 00:36:05,792
We should have just called 911,
but we panicked.

00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:08,962
(cloth tearing)

00:36:09,028 --> 00:36:11,164
(groaning)
Come on.

00:36:11,231 --> 00:36:13,833
SHEILA:
Shut up and just pull. We don't
have time to think about that.

00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,667
What are you doing?

00:36:14,734 --> 00:36:16,603
Look, let's just get him
in the van.

00:36:16,669 --> 00:36:17,871
I'll drive; you follow.

00:36:17,937 --> 00:36:19,105
(groans)

00:36:19,172 --> 00:36:21,474
Move. Move!

00:36:22,609 --> 00:36:24,544
Where is Ryan?

00:36:24,611 --> 00:36:26,479
(sobbing):
I just told you everything
I know.

00:36:26,546 --> 00:36:27,947
We left him in the van.

00:36:28,014 --> 00:36:28,882
What about Megan?

00:36:28,948 --> 00:36:31,050
The second we barged
into that field house,

00:36:31,117 --> 00:36:32,619
she freaked out and took off.

00:36:32,685 --> 00:36:34,988
I-I didn't even know
she was in the hospital

00:36:35,054 --> 00:36:36,189
until her parents called.

00:36:36,256 --> 00:36:38,691
Okay, come here
and take a look at this.

00:36:40,627 --> 00:36:43,830
Sheila's holding the camera;
you're holding the cue cards.

00:36:43,897 --> 00:36:45,265
Who's holding the light?

00:36:45,331 --> 00:36:46,966
Was there somebody else there?

00:36:47,033 --> 00:36:48,234
Uh-uh.

00:36:48,301 --> 00:36:49,435
Hmm?

00:36:49,502 --> 00:36:51,738
I-I was holding the light
and the cue card.

00:36:51,804 --> 00:36:53,907
Are you sure?

00:36:53,973 --> 00:36:56,776
It was just Sheila and me.

00:36:58,711 --> 00:37:01,447
(sobbing):
And now, it's just me.

00:37:30,476 --> 00:37:32,712
♪ ♪

00:37:46,192 --> 00:37:48,995
Okay, we got quite
the smorgasbord here.

00:37:49,062 --> 00:37:51,564
Um, the only constant
from the crabs is Ryan.

00:37:51,631 --> 00:37:54,234
He's half the DNA
on each of the combos.

00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,135
And the other contributors
were Megan, Sheila,

00:37:56,202 --> 00:37:57,437
several unknowns,

00:37:57,503 --> 00:37:59,072
and everybody's favorite
photography teacher,

00:37:59,138 --> 00:38:00,607
Diane Kentner.

00:38:00,673 --> 00:38:01,808
Certainly hope
she gave him an A.

00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:03,276
It proves sex with a minor.

00:38:03,343 --> 00:38:05,979
Even if we can't get her
for Megan's hit-and-run,

00:38:06,045 --> 00:38:07,447
it's enough
for a search warrant.

00:38:07,513 --> 00:38:10,250
(siren blaring)

00:38:10,316 --> 00:38:12,852
(garbled radio transmission)
So, what you find
at Diane's house?

00:38:12,919 --> 00:38:15,188
Uh, not much, but
propped up on a dresser

00:38:15,255 --> 00:38:16,422
was a rental
agreement

00:38:16,489 --> 00:38:18,291
to this address and a key.

00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:20,059
Looks like
she drew us a map.

00:38:20,126 --> 00:38:21,227
Looks like it.

00:38:21,294 --> 00:38:23,229
(garbled radio transmission)

00:38:23,296 --> 00:38:25,765
Diane Kentner,
open up!

00:38:25,832 --> 00:38:27,066
Las Vegas Police!

00:38:27,133 --> 00:38:28,468
There's our busted headlight.

00:38:31,504 --> 00:38:33,773

I'm slipping, Grissom.

I talked to this woman twice,
and this body was here

the whole time.

00:40:16,843 --> 00:40:18,945

00:40:25,852 --> 00:40:28,188
She was on a daily dose

00:40:28,254 --> 00:40:30,757
of lithium.

00:40:30,823 --> 00:40:33,126

Romeo and Juliet?

Postmortem

00:40:39,532 --> 00:40:42,202
photography-- <i>memento mori.</i>

00:40:42,268 --> 00:40:44,370
In the 19th century,
a photo

00:40:44,437 --> 00:40:46,639
of your dead loved one
was a popular keepsake.

00:40:46,706 --> 00:40:49,576
Death remembered.

00:40:49,642 --> 00:40:50,777
One last look.

00:40:50,843 --> 00:40:52,412
(high-pitched whirring, click)

00:40:52,478 --> 00:40:53,746
Hey.

(whirring, click)

00:40:54,814 --> 00:40:59,252
Charlie told Nick

00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:01,154
that Sheila pushed Ryan.

00:41:01,221 --> 00:41:05,124
BROWN:
Charlie lied...
to protect Megan.

00:41:05,191 --> 00:41:06,492
(whirring)

00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:09,596
How you feeling?

00:41:09,662 --> 00:41:11,798
Okay, considering.

00:41:11,865 --> 00:41:13,666
Oh, my parents are
in the cafeteria

00:41:13,733 --> 00:41:15,301
if you want to wait.

00:41:15,368 --> 00:41:17,303
Oh, no, no, I'm... I'm good.

00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:18,938
I just wanted
to show you something.

00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,576
What do you think about that?

00:41:23,643 --> 00:41:25,845
Is that me?

00:41:25,912 --> 00:41:28,281
What am I doing?

00:41:28,348 --> 00:41:30,450
Oh, it looks like
you're killing your boyfriend.

00:41:30,516 --> 00:41:32,018
You tell me.

00:41:32,085 --> 00:41:33,953
Who took this?

00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,089
Ms. Kentner.

00:41:36,155 --> 00:41:37,690
Oh, come on. Obsess much?

00:41:37,757 --> 00:41:39,459
Oh, so, you do remember?

00:41:40,493 --> 00:41:42,295
No.

00:41:42,362 --> 00:41:44,330
Not what happened that night.

00:41:44,397 --> 00:41:47,433
I wish I could get
selective amnesia.

00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,370
There's a lot in my past
I'd like to forget about.

00:41:56,042 --> 00:41:58,645
If I did push Ryan,

00:41:58,711 --> 00:42:01,180
and he died,

00:42:01,247 --> 00:42:03,249
then that was wrong.

00:42:05,952 --> 00:42:09,088
Don't you think that
I've been punished enough?

00:42:13,293 --> 00:42:15,295
EDDIE LANSCO:
<i>Are you telling me</i>

00:42:15,361 --> 00:42:17,964
you're not gonna
prosecute the girl
that killed my son?

00:42:18,031 --> 00:42:19,732
The DA decided
not to file.

00:42:19,799 --> 00:42:22,302
I mean, my guess is
that he probably felt

00:42:22,368 --> 00:42:23,636
he couldn't get
a conviction.

00:42:23,703 --> 00:42:25,638
Wh...

00:42:25,705 --> 00:42:27,707
Where's the justice in that?

00:42:27,774 --> 00:42:30,343
Everybody involved in this thing
has been punished in some way.

00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:32,545
I mean, Diane
and Sheila are dead.

00:42:32,612 --> 00:42:34,714
Charlie's probably going
to jail, and Megan...

00:42:34,781 --> 00:42:36,783
Got away
with murder.

00:43:09,015 --> 00:43:11,017
You trust me?

00:43:16,155 --> 00:43:18,673
Intimately.
