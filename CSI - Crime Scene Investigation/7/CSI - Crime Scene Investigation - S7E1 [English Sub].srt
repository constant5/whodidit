Yeah, it's fun trying

Well, that's taking
the fun out of it.

Hey, the coroner's

Vic's a Jane Doe,

Is she with the show?

According to statements,
she wasn't a part

00:03:58,142 --> 00:03:59,477
of Cirque du Soleil.

00:03:59,544 --> 00:04:02,847
Well, there's plenty
of surveillance.

00:04:02,914 --> 00:04:04,816
Yeah, but the body
was discovered backstage.

00:04:04,882 --> 00:04:06,484
What's it doing out here?

00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:08,052
I think he wants to tell you.

00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:11,055
Hi. Michel Souray,
company manager of <i>KA.</i>

00:04:11,122 --> 00:04:13,358
I'm sorry to meet you
under these circumstances.

00:04:13,424 --> 00:04:15,360
Why'd you move the body?

00:04:15,426 --> 00:04:16,761
SOURAY:
Backstage can be
a dangerous place

00:04:16,828 --> 00:04:18,129
if you don't know
your way around.

00:04:18,196 --> 00:04:20,031
So the Cirque
organization

00:04:20,098 --> 00:04:21,399
made a special
agreement

00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:22,734
with Clark County.

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,236
Any accidents that occur
inside our facility

00:04:25,303 --> 00:04:27,405
are under Cirque
jurisdiction.

00:04:27,472 --> 00:04:29,173
Our personnel
immediately

00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,708
transported her outside

00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:33,344
and the paramedics
arrived within minutes.

00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:37,915
I have no idea who
the poor girl is

00:04:37,982 --> 00:04:41,521
and I know every
face on our staff.

00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:43,701
Watch your step.

00:04:44,656 --> 00:04:45,790
During the performance,

00:04:45,857 --> 00:04:47,592
the stages above you
are always moving.

00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:52,430
We found
the body here

00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:58,269
Well, we know where she died.

The gun's still in his hand.

00:06:10,507 --> 00:06:11,975
How many suicides have
you seen like that?

00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,109
Personally?

00:06:13,176 --> 00:06:15,245
None.
Me, either.

00:06:15,311 --> 00:06:17,814
I haven't found a suicide note.

00:06:18,648 --> 00:06:21,351
Maybe it was staged.

00:06:23,653 --> 00:06:25,788
Sorry, got held up

00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:27,323
at the "meet the future
in-laws" dinner.

00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,126
Did they love you?

00:06:30,193 --> 00:06:32,228
I got a little too excited
talking about work.

00:06:32,295 --> 00:06:33,496
They stopped eating.

00:06:33,563 --> 00:06:35,265
Oh.

00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:37,167
David, the gun is still in his
hand; it's yours to clear.

00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:40,170
Yes, sir.

00:06:40,236 --> 00:06:42,172
Rigor's setting in fast.

00:06:42,238 --> 00:06:44,040
It happens when it's
hot like tonight.

00:06:44,107 --> 00:06:45,608
(gunshot)

00:06:45,675 --> 00:06:46,609
Oh, are you all right?

00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:48,378
You all right?

00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:50,146
It's all right
everyone, a misfire.

00:06:50,213 --> 00:06:51,714
Hey.

00:06:51,781 --> 00:06:53,883
At least we know one person
who shot the dead guy.

00:07:03,193 --> 00:07:05,128
Good to see you on
your feet again, Jim.

00:07:05,195 --> 00:07:07,530
You've never seen
me off them, Sam.

00:07:07,597 --> 00:07:09,065
You know, this
is like old times.

00:07:09,132 --> 00:07:10,667
You, me, a party.

00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:12,168
A dead body.

00:07:12,235 --> 00:07:15,038
This is supposed
to be a celebration.

00:07:15,104 --> 00:07:18,441
The Eclipse is going
to be my legacy.

00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:21,344
We break ground next year.

00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:23,546
So I'm guessing you knew
the victim-- Robert O'Brien?

00:07:23,613 --> 00:07:25,515
He invested in
The Eclipse.

00:07:25,582 --> 00:07:27,217
Did you hear the shot?

00:07:27,283 --> 00:07:29,786
No. Must've taken place

00:07:29,853 --> 00:07:31,087
during the implosion.

00:07:31,154 --> 00:07:32,322
You think he shot himself?

00:07:32,388 --> 00:07:34,324
You think he didn't?

00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,458
Well, he was about to make
a lot of money

00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:36,526
in your casino; why would he?

00:07:36,593 --> 00:07:39,062
Look, I hardly
knew the guy.

00:07:39,128 --> 00:07:41,097
Or his partner, Joe Hirschoff.

00:07:41,164 --> 00:07:43,700
They were marketing
the project in L.A.

00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:45,602
They had a little money,

00:07:45,668 --> 00:07:47,170
so I sold them a few shares.

00:07:47,237 --> 00:07:48,605
How much is a share?

00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:49,873
Two million.

00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:51,774
You want it?

00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:53,910
When was the last
time you saw him?

00:07:53,977 --> 00:07:57,347
Everyone was gathering on
the other side of the roof.

00:07:57,413 --> 00:07:59,582
I think he went off
with his partner.

00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,135
I got it.

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,705
Aircraft carrier.

00:08:22,772 --> 00:08:24,140
That's what this place
reminds me of.

00:08:24,207 --> 00:08:26,609
Of course,
an aircraft carrier

00:08:26,676 --> 00:08:29,913
was built for national security

00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:32,248
and this is a ton of hi-tech,

00:08:32,315 --> 00:08:34,050
twisted steel for the sake
of entertainment.

00:08:34,117 --> 00:08:36,619
It's not just
entertainment, Nick.

00:08:36,686 --> 00:08:38,321
The cirque's
about the power

00:08:38,388 --> 00:08:39,522
of imagination--
it's how we were

00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:41,124
able to put a man on the moon.

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,435
I've got a monogram necklace.

00:08:52,502 --> 00:08:54,571
A.F.D.

00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:56,739
Well, it's not
an I.D.,

00:08:56,806 --> 00:08:58,508
but I'll settle for initials.

00:09:02,745 --> 00:09:05,181
Did you and Mr. O'Brien
arrive together?

00:09:05,248 --> 00:09:07,484
Yeah, we're in
a suite downstairs.

00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,319
And you've been
with him since?

00:09:09,385 --> 00:09:11,321
Mostly.

00:09:11,387 --> 00:09:13,623
A couple minutes before,
um, the implosion,

00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,058
I went to get us margaritas.

00:09:15,124 --> 00:09:16,593
When I came back,
Robert was gone.

00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:19,429
I knew he didn't
want to miss it,
so I went looking.

00:09:28,404 --> 00:09:30,006
I was by the elevator.

00:09:30,073 --> 00:09:33,143
I thought maybe Robert
had gone back to the suite.

00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:35,678
Then I heard that girl scream.

00:09:37,614 --> 00:09:39,282
I just knew.

00:09:39,349 --> 00:09:41,384
Are you taking any medication?

00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:47,290
May I see that?

00:09:49,092 --> 00:09:50,727
Alprazolam.

00:09:50,793 --> 00:09:53,129
It's for stress.
My job is very stressful.

00:09:53,196 --> 00:09:54,998
Does Mr. O'Brien own a gun?

00:09:55,064 --> 00:09:57,400
He hates guns, we both do.

00:09:57,467 --> 00:09:59,502
Could you hold your hands out
for me like this please?

00:09:59,569 --> 00:10:01,137
Why?

00:10:01,204 --> 00:10:03,139
Gunshot residue test.

00:10:03,206 --> 00:10:04,908
Robert shot himself.

00:10:04,974 --> 00:10:06,743
And this is
how we prove it.

00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,845
SIDLE:
Right palm down.

00:10:12,816 --> 00:10:14,484
(sniffs)

00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:16,352
Am I smelling alcohol
on your hand?

00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:19,255
Yeah.

00:10:19,322 --> 00:10:21,257
When I saw Robert,
I spilled the drinks.

00:10:26,729 --> 00:10:29,599
ROBBINS:
Standard S.A.E. was collected.

00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,335
No signs
of sexual trauma indicated.

00:10:36,673 --> 00:10:39,609
Several linear
red-brown abrasions

00:10:39,676 --> 00:10:41,411
on the chest and back.

00:10:41,478 --> 00:10:44,481
Marginal contusions.

00:10:47,517 --> 00:10:52,555
Palpable underlying
rib and sternal fractures.

00:10:52,622 --> 00:10:54,224
(crackling)

00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,125
Huh, Rice Krispies.

00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:58,461
Subcutaneous emphysema.

00:10:58,528 --> 00:11:01,464
Air in the tissue
indicates victim

00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:04,100
was most likely subjected

00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:07,237
<i>to significant crushing force</i>
<i>across the torso.</i>

00:11:07,303 --> 00:11:09,739
(groaning)

00:11:09,806 --> 00:11:10,840
(screaming)

00:11:13,877 --> 00:11:16,779
You know, this crush zone
is clearly marked.

00:11:16,846 --> 00:11:18,948
Yeah, and anybody familiar
with the stage

00:11:19,015 --> 00:11:21,050
would know to avoid that area.

00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,855
Looks like blood on the edge
of this lift.

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,093
It might have been unavoidable.

00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:37,688
ROBBINS:
Her liver was lacerated.

00:11:37,755 --> 00:11:40,024
If she'd been alive
when the crushing occurred,

00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:42,894
these lacerations would of
resulted in hemoperitoneum

00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,830
and, uh, bilateral
hemothorax.

00:11:46,864 --> 00:11:49,567
But there was no
significant hemorrhage

00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:53,070
in the abdominal
or thoracic cavities.

00:11:53,137 --> 00:11:55,439
So she was dead
before she was crushed.

00:11:55,506 --> 00:12:00,044
Yeah, C.O.D. was temporal
laceration of the brain

00:12:00,111 --> 00:12:01,412
due to skull fracture.

00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:03,014
Initially,

00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,082
I assumed it was associated
with a crushing trauma.

00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:06,217
It wasn't.

00:12:06,284 --> 00:12:08,319
So the fatal blow was
a separate event.

00:12:08,386 --> 00:12:09,687
Mm-hmm.

00:12:09,754 --> 00:12:11,756
Well, the way things move
around on that stage,

00:12:11,822 --> 00:12:13,357
it could have
happened anywhere.

00:12:13,424 --> 00:12:16,093
She looks like she's
probably in her mid-20s.

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,562
She's in good shape.

00:12:17,628 --> 00:12:18,629
Yeah.

00:12:20,464 --> 00:12:22,066
Is well toned.

00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:24,235
She got calluses

00:12:24,302 --> 00:12:26,437
on her hands and feet.

00:12:26,504 --> 00:12:28,339
Could be a dancer
or a gymnast.

00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:30,408
But if she wasn't
part of Cirque,

00:12:30,474 --> 00:12:32,043
what was she doing there?

00:12:34,745 --> 00:12:35,713
BRASS:
<i>Hey Sheriff, how's it going?</i>

00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,014
What can I do for you?

00:12:37,081 --> 00:12:39,250
This is about what
I can do for you.

00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:41,385
Really?
I've asked the Mayor to
give you a commendation.

00:12:41,452 --> 00:12:42,486
Medal of Valor.

00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,855
Congratulations.

00:12:43,921 --> 00:12:47,058
Well, that's-that's nice,
uh, do I have to be there?

00:12:47,124 --> 00:12:48,359
As a matter of protocol,

00:12:48,426 --> 00:12:50,027
I'd say you damn well
better be, Captain.

00:12:50,094 --> 00:12:51,529
Well, you know,
Ben, if--

00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:53,397
Look, I'm going to
say a few nice things,

00:12:53,464 --> 00:12:54,899
hand you a plaque,
we'll shake hands,

00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:56,534
a whole lot of reporters
will be there

00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:58,035
to take pictures
of the big event.

00:12:58,102 --> 00:12:59,136
It'll be magic.
Yeah.

00:12:59,203 --> 00:13:01,038
My office will call
you to set it up.

00:13:01,105 --> 00:13:04,408
I was going to vote
for you anyway.

00:13:04,475 --> 00:13:07,612
HODGES:
The green powder
on your vic's dress

00:13:07,678 --> 00:13:10,248
is open-celled phenolic foam.

00:13:10,314 --> 00:13:12,450
Holds more than 40 times
its weight in water.

00:13:12,516 --> 00:13:14,952
Reminds me of this girl
I knew in college--

00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:16,387
I don't need
to hear about that.

00:13:16,454 --> 00:13:18,489
She was a florist.

00:13:18,556 --> 00:13:20,892
The foam's used
almost exclusively

00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,093
in floral arrangements.

00:13:24,362 --> 00:13:25,663
Wait a minute.

00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:32,036
The security guard at <i>KAsaid</i>
that he let a young woman

00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,272
through the artists' entrance
with a delivery of flowers.

00:13:34,338 --> 00:13:35,706
He escorted her
to the green room,

00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,675
but didn't remember
seeing her leave.

00:13:37,742 --> 00:13:39,977
Ah, the old flower
delivery trick.

00:13:40,044 --> 00:13:41,712
Works every time.

00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,381
Huh.

00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:49,020
SANDERS:
Cirque du Soleil has cameras
all over that theatre.

00:13:49,086 --> 00:13:52,056
They use them for
performance review.

00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:55,526
I went through all the feeds
the Cirque guys sent over,

00:13:55,593 --> 00:13:57,261
and I have to tell you,
Siegfried &amp; Roy's

00:13:57,328 --> 00:13:59,964
disappearing elephant
no longer impresses me.

00:14:00,031 --> 00:14:01,899
I'll tell you
how they did that later.

00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:04,702
STOKES:
There's the vic,
right?

00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:05,937
Yup, 11-D.

00:14:06,003 --> 00:14:07,171
Artist's entrance.

00:14:07,238 --> 00:14:08,773
Girl has the same kind

00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:11,375
of dress and hair color
as the vic.

00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:12,944
As far as I can see,
they managed

00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,880
to stay hidden backstage
for most of the performance.

00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:16,981
It's dark,
they're wearing

00:14:17,048 --> 00:14:18,015
black...

00:14:18,082 --> 00:14:19,016
crew's focused

00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,084
on their jobs...

00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,186
it's possible
nobody saw them.

00:14:22,253 --> 00:14:25,022
The guy left alone,
same way they came in,

00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:27,225
just before
the show ended.

00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,726
I tried to make out a face,

00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:31,195
but there's not
much detail here.

00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:32,663
However, look at this.

00:14:33,397 --> 00:14:35,132
Check this out.

00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,638
GRISSOM:
She dropped something.

00:14:40,705 --> 00:14:42,173
I think it's a purse.

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,041
There was no purse
near the body.

00:14:44,108 --> 00:14:45,309
Or anywhere else backstage.

00:14:45,376 --> 00:14:48,179
If we find it,
it might get us an ID.

00:14:51,749 --> 00:14:54,552
STOKES:
Give me the time code
when she dropped the purse.

00:14:55,753 --> 00:14:57,021
Okay, who's in
the burrito?

00:14:57,088 --> 00:14:59,724
It's apparent suicide,
from Sam Braun's party.

00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,359
Sara and Warrick's case.

00:15:01,425 --> 00:15:02,927
Gunshot to the head.

00:15:16,774 --> 00:15:18,442
What's this?

00:15:19,644 --> 00:15:21,779
He bled out in the bag.

00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:23,881
I guess I forgot

00:15:23,948 --> 00:15:25,182
to tape them shut.

00:15:28,486 --> 00:15:31,322
This blood corrupts any GSR.

00:15:33,624 --> 00:15:35,126
Clean it up.

00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:41,766
♪ ♪

00:16:11,128 --> 00:16:14,098
♪ ♪

00:16:42,927 --> 00:16:45,930
♪ ♪

00:17:06,284 --> 00:17:07,685
SARA:
Hey, Doc,
you tell me.

00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:10,354
Suicide or homicide?

00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:12,390
Either side at this point.

00:17:12,456 --> 00:17:14,592
According to Tox,
B.A.C. was point-one-nine.

00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,161
That's over twice
the legal limit.
My guess,

00:17:17,228 --> 00:17:20,464
based on the whiffing the
stomach contents, tequila.

00:17:20,531 --> 00:17:22,166
You're good,
he was drinking margaritas.

00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:23,801
Tox also found

00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:25,236
alprazolam in his bloodstream.

00:17:25,303 --> 00:17:26,337
Yeah, his partner has

00:17:26,404 --> 00:17:27,338
a prescription for it.

00:17:27,405 --> 00:17:28,906
He was also the one bringing

00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:30,074
him drinks.
Hmm.

00:17:30,141 --> 00:17:32,176
Hand me that
trajectory rod.
Sure.

00:17:32,243 --> 00:17:33,344
Thank you.

00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,720
Sara, hold this
in would you?
Sure.

00:17:42,787 --> 00:17:43,788
Here we go.

00:17:44,956 --> 00:17:47,024
However he got it,

00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:49,560
he probably would've been
too stoned to stand.

00:17:49,627 --> 00:17:52,730
It would of made it easier
to stick a gun in his mouth

00:17:52,797 --> 00:17:54,398
<i>at this angle.</i>

00:17:56,834 --> 00:17:58,703
(people cheering)

00:18:00,471 --> 00:18:02,273
Look in there.

00:18:05,076 --> 00:18:06,177
Sesame seeds?

00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:07,511
I think so.

00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:08,846
I found them in the oral cavity,

00:18:08,913 --> 00:18:10,915
but not in the stomach contents.

00:18:10,982 --> 00:18:14,218
It's hard to swallow when
you have a gun in your mouth.

00:18:19,911 --> 00:18:22,347
STOKES:
Okay, let me know
when the Cliff Deck

00:18:22,414 --> 00:18:25,717
is where it was
at that point in the show.

00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:27,652
Um, I think it was just before

00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:31,022
the "Wash Up to the Shore"
scene.

00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:34,526
That was at, uh,
21 minutes, 37 seconds.

00:18:34,593 --> 00:18:36,828
MAN (over radio):
Copy that.

00:18:36,895 --> 00:18:38,863
Yeah, that's great.

00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,498
That's great right there,
thanks.

00:18:43,368 --> 00:18:45,537
Okay...

00:18:45,604 --> 00:18:48,240
go find your friend.

00:18:52,544 --> 00:18:56,514
Okay, move the Deck
into its next position, please.

00:18:56,581 --> 00:18:58,984
Copy that,
foot deck is on the move.

00:19:15,533 --> 00:19:18,403
Initiating dump sequence.

00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:47,666
Amazing.

00:19:47,732 --> 00:19:49,200
Ground cork.

00:19:49,267 --> 00:19:50,835
From the audience,
it looks like real sand.

00:19:50,902 --> 00:19:52,237
You know,
if you want

00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:54,372
to dive in here
and give me a hand

00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:55,674
this might go
a little faster.

00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,375
(giggles)

00:19:57,442 --> 00:19:59,444
Nice try.

00:20:02,747 --> 00:20:04,716
Okay, hang on.

00:20:04,783 --> 00:20:07,385
I think I found something.

00:20:07,452 --> 00:20:09,454
This isn't the purse I dropped.

00:20:16,528 --> 00:20:19,197
Celia Noel, Wisconsin.

00:20:19,264 --> 00:20:21,466
Well, the initials
on the necklace

00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:23,101
that Catherine found were

00:20:23,168 --> 00:20:24,369
"A-F-D".

00:20:24,436 --> 00:20:25,470
Well, clearly

00:20:25,537 --> 00:20:27,305
not her initials,
but check this out.

00:20:29,274 --> 00:20:32,043
It looks like she hit every
Cirque show in town.

00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,813
Apparently one a little bit
harder than the others.

00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:39,484
BURDICK:
<i>On May 11, 2006,</i>

00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,254
with an innocent life
hanging in the balance,

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,290
Captain Brass went into that
hotel room alone,

00:20:45,357 --> 00:20:47,759
face-to-face
with a deranged killer.

00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:49,761
Brass looks like
he's about to puke.

00:20:49,828 --> 00:20:51,830
Captain Brass
was severely wounded,
Or punch someone.

00:20:51,896 --> 00:20:53,265
but the hostage's life
was saved.

00:20:53,331 --> 00:20:56,568
And for these actions
which exemplify the dedication

00:20:56,635 --> 00:20:59,204
of the Las Vegas
Police Department,

00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:00,972
the City thanks you.

00:21:04,843 --> 00:21:06,278
REPORTER:
This is Captain Brass'
second commendation

00:21:06,344 --> 00:21:07,345
in the line of duty.

00:21:07,412 --> 00:21:09,781
The first was in...

00:21:09,848 --> 00:21:12,450
I got you a
veggie burger.

00:21:12,517 --> 00:21:13,818
Thanks.

00:21:13,885 --> 00:21:15,287
What about me?

00:21:15,353 --> 00:21:17,522
I didn't know you were here.
<i>Soy</i> sorry.

00:21:18,924 --> 00:21:20,258
Where's the love?

00:21:20,325 --> 00:21:21,993
So we found some gunk

00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,795
in the revolver's forcing cone.

00:21:23,862 --> 00:21:25,196
Hodges ID'd it as...

00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:26,631
melted sesame seeds.

00:21:26,698 --> 00:21:28,867
Doc Robbins found sesame seeds
in the vic's mouth.

00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:31,937
Any prints on the gun?
No.

00:21:32,003 --> 00:21:33,939
The grip was checked, we don't
usually get prints off those.

00:21:34,005 --> 00:21:35,273
Is it registered?

00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,175
In California,
to a Joe Hirschoff.

00:21:37,242 --> 00:21:38,677
Really?
Yeah.

00:21:38,743 --> 00:21:40,211
He said he hated guns.

00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:41,513
Check this out...

00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,349
I researched ownership
in The Eclipse project.

00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:47,452
The vic and Joe Hirschoff
held their share

00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:49,821
as joint tenants.
Really?

00:21:49,888 --> 00:21:51,323
Which means...

00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:53,758
With Robert dead,
Joe automatically

00:21:53,825 --> 00:21:55,827
and immediately
owns all the shares.

00:21:55,894 --> 00:21:58,129
Sounds like
a great reason to kill.

00:21:58,196 --> 00:21:59,464
Why did you lie?

00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:01,900
I didn't lie.

00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:04,936
I bought the gun
when I moved to L.A.

00:22:05,003 --> 00:22:08,240
White kid
from a small town...

00:22:08,306 --> 00:22:09,674
Put it in a closet.

00:22:09,741 --> 00:22:10,675
Forgot it was there.

00:22:10,742 --> 00:22:13,345
How did Robert get it?
I don't...

00:22:13,411 --> 00:22:15,413
Going through my stuff, I guess.

00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,649
Did he take your pills?

00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:19,618
'Cause we found them
in his bloodstream.

00:22:20,652 --> 00:22:21,886
I don't know.

00:22:21,953 --> 00:22:24,022
You don't know?
No, I don't know.

00:22:24,089 --> 00:22:25,457
Robert was depressed.
Maybe he did.

00:22:25,523 --> 00:22:27,726
You know, we did a credit
check on you, Joe.

00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:29,894
You're in hock for over
a million dollars.

00:22:29,961 --> 00:22:31,896
It's personal debt--
that's heavy paper.

00:22:32,931 --> 00:22:34,399
I'm leveraged.

00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:35,900
(chuckles)
Yeah, I'm leveraged.

00:22:35,967 --> 00:22:37,936
So what?

00:22:38,003 --> 00:22:39,271
(chuckling):
I live well...

00:22:41,706 --> 00:22:43,341
I live well
by believing in myself.

00:22:43,408 --> 00:22:47,279
No, you live well by playing the
come line with borrowed money.

00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:49,381
You know, Joe,
you're the type of guy--

00:22:49,447 --> 00:22:51,449
you see something you like,
you got to have it,

00:22:51,516 --> 00:22:54,185
including your partner's share
in The Eclipse.

00:22:54,252 --> 00:22:57,455
So you put your pills in
his drink, he nods off,

00:22:57,522 --> 00:23:00,058
you wrap his fingers around
your gun, and then you get

00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:01,660
to live really well.

00:23:04,796 --> 00:23:06,398
I want my lawyer.

00:23:07,432 --> 00:23:09,501
SIDLE:
Is this everything?

00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:11,770
BROWN:
Everything from Hirschoff's
and O'Brien's room

00:23:11,836 --> 00:23:13,204
that I could get
under the warrant.

00:23:13,271 --> 00:23:14,639
No suicide note?

00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:18,376
Not even in the Holy Bible.

00:23:18,443 --> 00:23:20,845
That is the first place
I look, too.

00:23:26,718 --> 00:23:28,587
Did the suite have a kitchen?

00:23:29,688 --> 00:23:31,089
No.

00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:33,725
Why pack an oven mitt?

00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:43,468
Sesame seeds.

00:23:48,006 --> 00:23:50,242
The blood on the necklace
was the victim's.

00:23:50,308 --> 00:23:51,543
A.F.D.

00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,111
Arcadia Federation
of Dance.

00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:55,947
Celia Noel was a dancer,

00:23:56,014 --> 00:23:59,184
which would explain her
fascination with Cirque.

00:23:59,251 --> 00:24:00,452
You still like to dance?

00:24:02,387 --> 00:24:05,757
I don't mean the way
you used to, I...

00:24:05,824 --> 00:24:08,393
I know what you mean,
and yes, I do.

00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:13,131
I think I have a line
on the victim's date.

00:24:13,198 --> 00:24:15,400
Now, four of the tickets
that we pulled from her purse

00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:17,202
were charged
to her credit card,

00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:19,304
but the <i>Zumanity</i>
ticket was purchased

00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:20,505
with a different card,

00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:23,708
one belonging
to a gentleman named Arnie...

00:24:23,775 --> 00:24:25,977
Clifton.

00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:27,746
He should have
paid cash.

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,023
Yeah, Celia and I
scoped out <i>Zumanity.</i>

00:24:38,089 --> 00:24:39,925
Sexy stuff.

00:24:39,991 --> 00:24:41,426
CURTIS:
Right up your alley.

00:24:41,493 --> 00:24:43,361
I've got all kinds
of alleys, but, uh,

00:24:43,428 --> 00:24:45,563
yeah, I'd say
that's one of them.

00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,499
How'd you two meet?

00:24:47,565 --> 00:24:49,301
I touched her feet
for over an hour.

00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:51,002
She tried on 20 pairs of shoes.

00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:53,305
Did she invite you to the show?

00:24:53,371 --> 00:24:55,040
Yeah.

00:24:55,106 --> 00:24:56,374
Did you pay for it?

00:24:56,441 --> 00:24:58,376
I'm a gentleman.

00:24:58,443 --> 00:25:00,078
Best toe cleavage I ever saw.

00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:01,513
CURTIS:
What did you do

00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,582
after the show?
Nothing.

00:25:03,648 --> 00:25:05,684
We had a nice time; she split.

00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,018
Haven't seen her since.

00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:09,721
We have.

00:25:09,788 --> 00:25:10,722
She's dead.

00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:13,024
Backstage at <i>KA.</i>

00:25:13,091 --> 00:25:14,025
You didn't join her

00:25:14,092 --> 00:25:16,328
for the double feature?
(scoffs)

00:25:16,394 --> 00:25:18,029
Nah, man, not me.

00:25:18,096 --> 00:25:19,331
Look, uh,

00:25:19,397 --> 00:25:22,367
are we done, 'cause I got
to get back to work.

00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:24,102
STOKES:
No, we're not done here.

00:25:25,136 --> 00:25:27,238
You got sand in your shoes.

00:25:30,508 --> 00:25:34,512
Finely ground particles
of Portuguese cork.

00:25:34,579 --> 00:25:37,249
Same stuff they use
backstage at <i>KA,</i>

00:25:37,315 --> 00:25:40,185
which places you
at the crime scene.

00:25:42,721 --> 00:25:44,723
Okay, so what if I was there?

00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:46,391
You were there
with a woman

00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:49,094
who wound up dead,
which is why you're here.

00:25:50,128 --> 00:25:52,030
<i>Zumanity</i> got me all worked up.

00:25:52,097 --> 00:25:53,131
She was grabbing on me.

00:25:53,198 --> 00:25:54,766
I-I was down to do
whatever she wanted.

00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:56,234
What did she want to do?

00:25:56,301 --> 00:25:58,370
Go backstage at <i>KA,</i> see it
up close and personal.

00:25:58,436 --> 00:26:00,538
She was bananas about that show.

00:26:00,605 --> 00:26:03,241
She said to meet her
near the artists' entrance

00:26:03,308 --> 00:26:04,409
just after the show started.

00:26:04,476 --> 00:26:06,211
I did. She let me in.

00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:08,446
And you thought if you went
with her, you'd get laid?

00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:12,384
I figured maybe backstage at <i>KA</i>

00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,586
was her version
of the mile high club.

00:26:14,653 --> 00:26:17,455
Come on, come on.

00:26:17,522 --> 00:26:19,057
Celia, just relax
for a minute.

00:26:19,124 --> 00:26:20,625
Come on.

00:26:26,831 --> 00:26:30,268
<i>Something clipped her</i>
<i>in the side of the head.</i>

00:26:30,335 --> 00:26:33,238
<i>She fell.</i>
<i>She didn't even scream.</i>

00:26:33,305 --> 00:26:35,840
I was just so freaked out,
I bailed, I'm telling you.

00:26:35,907 --> 00:26:38,476
I tried to warn her,
but she was just too fired up.

00:26:38,543 --> 00:26:41,112
She kept trying to get closer
and closer and closer.

00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:43,515
Yeah, and you let her.

00:26:43,582 --> 00:26:46,851
You need to write
a statement.

00:26:46,918 --> 00:26:51,656
I perfected my butterfly
technique on chicken breasts.

00:26:51,723 --> 00:26:54,960
I sauté them
in a chardonnay reduction

00:26:55,026 --> 00:26:58,029
with herbes de Provence.

00:26:58,096 --> 00:27:00,632
Drives women wild.

00:27:00,699 --> 00:27:03,134
Well, Mom.

00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:05,370
Now say the magic words.

00:27:05,437 --> 00:27:08,473
"Shut up, Hodges"?

00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,342
No. "Open sesame."

00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,366
Hand me that can of Ferro-Trace.

00:27:34,432 --> 00:27:37,502
I live to serve.

00:27:46,645 --> 00:27:50,081
The gun was transported to
the hotel room in the oven mitt.

00:27:50,148 --> 00:27:51,850
Only question is,

00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:54,119
who brought it to the party?

00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:01,209
SIDLE:
<i>The trail of seeds proved it.</i>

00:29:02,744 --> 00:29:05,714
<i>It was suicide, after all.</i>

00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,781
(gunshot)

00:29:09,851 --> 00:29:11,953
It's the first time
I've ever seen a suicide

00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,755
where the gun stays
in the vic's hand.

00:29:13,822 --> 00:29:15,690
I have an explanation
for that, too.

00:29:15,757 --> 00:29:17,459
Dupuytren's contracture.

00:29:17,525 --> 00:29:19,361
It's a rare condition,
characterized

00:29:19,427 --> 00:29:22,163
by progressive fibrosis
of the palmar fascia,

00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,732
The tissues thicken...

00:29:24,766 --> 00:29:27,002
<i>...contracting the fingers.</i>

00:29:27,068 --> 00:29:29,671
<i>He couldn't let go of the gun.</i>

00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,641
The condition was still
in its early stages,

00:29:32,707 --> 00:29:35,143
which is why
it looked like rigor.

00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,945
Do we have any idea
why he killed himself?

00:29:37,012 --> 00:29:38,046
Depression, maybe.

00:29:38,113 --> 00:29:40,715
You know, according
to my supervisor,

00:29:40,782 --> 00:29:42,984
we're not really
in the business of why, but...

00:29:43,051 --> 00:29:45,287
(phone rings)

00:29:45,353 --> 00:29:46,621
I got to go.

00:29:46,688 --> 00:29:48,356
Bye.

00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:52,727
SIDLE:
These are Robert's
personal effects.

00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:15,183
I'm very sorry for your loss.

00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,430
Okay. I'll do it.

00:30:28,496 --> 00:30:29,831
Hey, Jim.

00:30:29,898 --> 00:30:31,600
What's up?

00:30:33,635 --> 00:30:35,370
Where's your hardware?

00:30:35,437 --> 00:30:37,205
Oh, come on, come on.

00:30:37,272 --> 00:30:39,274
Don't even try it;
you were all over the news.

00:30:39,341 --> 00:30:40,442
Let's see it.
(groans)

00:30:43,445 --> 00:30:45,180
Wow.

00:30:45,246 --> 00:30:47,515
That's beautiful.

00:30:47,582 --> 00:30:49,017
What's with
all the modesty?

00:30:49,084 --> 00:30:50,652
It should be
up on your wall, man.

00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:51,853
For what?

00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,522
For taking a bullet
or not dying?

00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:56,391
For being brave.

00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:57,826
You know, Warrick,
I'll tell you something.

00:30:57,892 --> 00:31:00,228
I walked into that hotel room,
and 23 years of police work

00:31:00,295 --> 00:31:02,063
told me I knew
what that guy was about.

00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,132
And he played me
like a damn rookie.

00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:06,635
He beat me at my own game.

00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:10,272
I mean, what's the dumbest
thing you've ever done?

00:31:10,338 --> 00:31:14,476
You want to make a poster
of it, put it on your wall?

00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:16,578
I don't think so.

00:31:16,645 --> 00:31:18,446
(plaque clattering)

00:31:20,482 --> 00:31:22,484
But thanks for coming by.

00:31:23,518 --> 00:31:24,853
All right.

00:31:31,293 --> 00:31:33,561
So do you think
Grissom will show?

00:31:33,628 --> 00:31:35,430
Not if he thinks
he has to dance.
(chuckles)

00:31:35,497 --> 00:31:37,465
MAN (over speaker):
Ladies and gentlemen,
tomorrow night,

00:31:37,532 --> 00:31:40,235
more than 18,000 people are
going to come and see this guy

00:31:40,302 --> 00:31:41,603
at the Thomas and Mack Center.

00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:44,072
But tonight, you guys
are going to hear him first.

00:31:44,139 --> 00:31:47,575
Everybody give it up
for Mr. John Mayer!

00:31:47,642 --> 00:31:48,610
(applause and cheering)

00:31:48,677 --> 00:31:50,445
Ooh. I like him.

00:31:50,512 --> 00:31:52,180
I think you got to dance.

00:31:52,247 --> 00:31:54,382
Come on, let's go.
My God.

00:31:54,449 --> 00:31:58,853

00:37:14,284 --> 00:37:17,154
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

00:37:19,857 --> 00:37:21,725
No.

00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,294
The detail is...

00:37:24,361 --> 00:37:25,763
Terrifying.

GRISSOM:
Impressive.

I've always been an egg man.

00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:47,684

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,107
WOMAN (on phone):
Las Vegas Crime Lab?

00:39:17,174 --> 00:39:18,942
How can I help you?
