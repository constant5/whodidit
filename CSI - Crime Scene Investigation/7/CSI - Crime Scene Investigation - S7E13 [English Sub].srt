00:00:12,092 --> 00:00:13,894

<i>Zamesca dedicated his life</i>

00:00:19,366 --> 00:00:20,934

00:00:22,202 --> 00:00:25,139
<i>He believed you get drugs</i>

00:00:29,202 --> 00:00:31,082

00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,467

Guys like Thomas Simon
never get their hands dirty.

00:02:27,084 --> 00:02:29,120
No. It was
a very clean print.

00:02:29,187 --> 00:02:31,622
And Ballistics matched some
shell casings that we found

00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:33,391
at Simon's McMansion
on that raid last year.

00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:34,659
Did you find the gun?

00:02:34,725 --> 00:02:36,928
No. So Zamesca was trying
to put Simon out of business,

00:02:36,994 --> 00:02:38,196
and it cost him his life.

00:02:38,262 --> 00:02:40,932
(rock music playing)

00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,794
Hey.

00:03:09,861 --> 00:03:11,562
I have a warrant
for Thomas Simon.

00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:12,597
Is he here?

00:03:12,663 --> 00:03:13,931
He's the owner, man.

00:03:13,998 --> 00:03:16,000
But even I haven't seen him
in, like, three weeks.

00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:18,369
Sorry.

McKEEN:
The biggest drug supplier

00:03:25,309 --> 00:03:28,079
kills a public official,
and we can't find him.

00:03:28,146 --> 00:03:29,914
I'm just the
undersheriff.

00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:31,949
I have one job:

00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:33,684
make the sheriff look smart.

00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:34,819
You're not helping.

00:03:34,886 --> 00:03:35,853
BRASS:
We busted our hump

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,954
trying to
find this guy.

00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:38,990
Science can only do
so much with a cold trail.

00:03:39,056 --> 00:03:40,158
You ever seen a man's face

00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:41,492
change into
that kind of a demon?

00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:43,327
My eggs are runny.

00:03:43,394 --> 00:03:45,530
I couldn't have
been more specific

00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:48,499
with the waitress.

00:03:48,566 --> 00:03:49,600
You gonna eat those?

00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:51,402
Oh, you want my pancakes?

00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:52,870
Yeah, sure,
knock yourself out.

00:03:52,937 --> 00:03:54,105
Here.

00:03:54,172 --> 00:03:57,041
Thank you.

00:03:57,108 --> 00:04:00,178
I don't hear a solution.

00:04:02,547 --> 00:04:05,750
We could try something
I did in Philly.

00:04:05,817 --> 00:04:08,553
It's, um, a little unorthodox.

00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:10,121
I only want to know
if it works.

00:04:10,188 --> 00:04:11,756
Philly, yes.

00:04:11,823 --> 00:04:13,057
Baltimore, no.

00:04:13,124 --> 00:04:14,859
Is that why you're in Vegas?

00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:19,130
Fifty-fifty.
I can live with those odds.

00:04:19,197 --> 00:04:20,965
So, are you waiting
for a drumroll?

00:04:21,032 --> 00:04:23,868
It's called "reverse forensics."
WILLOWS: Oh.

00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,503
We fake a crime scene.

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,038
Basically.

00:04:27,104 --> 00:04:28,072
How do we get around entrapment?

00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:29,407
Well, it's not
entrapment

00:04:29,474 --> 00:04:31,542
if you're not enticing anyone
to commit a crime.

00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:34,145
The goal is to make Simon
think he's off the hook.

00:04:34,212 --> 00:04:35,513
So what's the catch?

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,715
Whole thing's a catch.

00:04:37,782 --> 00:04:40,351
The hardest part is
stopping leaks.

00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:41,986
You've got to be willing

00:04:42,053 --> 00:04:43,955
to deceive
the people you work with.

00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:47,191
Assuming they can be deceived,
which they can't.

00:04:47,258 --> 00:04:48,493
Not your call.

00:04:50,027 --> 00:04:51,496
You know,
I can think of nine,

00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:53,531
no, ten ways
that this could screw up.

00:04:53,598 --> 00:04:55,333
At least.

00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,935
So don't screw it up.

00:04:58,002 --> 00:05:01,105
The first thing we need is
a victim, somebody we own.

00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:03,174
And you need a fall guy to
play the role of "killer,"

00:05:03,241 --> 00:05:05,543
somebody who's jake with
having his mug shot everywhere.

00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,178
In Baltimore,

00:05:07,245 --> 00:05:08,513
we used a snitch.

00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:10,615
So you're going to have
to bring the D.A. into this.

00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:11,816
(scoffs)

00:05:11,883 --> 00:05:14,118
The D.A.?

00:05:14,185 --> 00:05:16,020
That bitch won't like it.

00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:18,022
Thanks for breakfast.

00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:20,124
(scoffs)

00:05:22,093 --> 00:05:23,661
You ever notice
how it's the, uh,

00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:25,563
guys with all the money
that never pay?
Sure,

00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,898
that's how they keep
all the money.

00:05:26,964 --> 00:05:27,932
Here, let me get it.

00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:29,934
No, I got it. New guy.

00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:31,636
Thank you.

00:05:31,702 --> 00:05:33,704
You know, Catherine,
if we do our job right

00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:36,808
and catch the bad guy, nobody's
going to remember the rest.

00:05:37,842 --> 00:05:39,877

Hey, Mike.

00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:23,258
Do you guys, uh, organize
your files by case number?

00:06:23,325 --> 00:06:25,260
In a perfect world.

00:06:25,327 --> 00:06:26,661
We hired this, uh,

00:06:26,728 --> 00:06:27,662
knucklehead
named Mahoney.

00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:30,699
He had this dyslexic
filing system.

00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:32,801
So what do you think?

00:06:32,868 --> 00:06:36,171
Does the dyslexic atheist
not believe in dog?

00:06:36,238 --> 00:06:37,606
What?

00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:43,078
Oh... I get it.

00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,051
Hey.

00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,519
I need you on
a 411 tonight.

00:06:50,585 --> 00:06:52,954
Stolen motor vehicles?

00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:54,189
You got to be kidding me.

00:06:54,256 --> 00:06:55,724
P.D. recovered 20
stolen motorcycles.

00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,092
They're at the
Dupont Towing Lot.

00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,994
Can't you slide it to Days?
BROWN:
Hey, guys.

00:07:00,028 --> 00:07:01,730
Take Warrick
with you.

00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:03,198
It'll go faster.

00:07:03,265 --> 00:07:04,900
Okay.
What'll go faster?

00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:07,769
Giddyup.

00:07:09,438 --> 00:07:11,940
(meows)

00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,248
What's happening, Rat?

00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,250
Boy, you got to
love junkies, huh?

00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,352
What stamina,
what willpower.

00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,788
I mean, even the rain
doesn't keep them away.

00:07:26,855 --> 00:07:29,558
It doesn't keep the cops away
either, I guess, huh?

00:07:29,624 --> 00:07:31,660
You nervous, Rat? Relax,
relax, I'm just here to talk.

00:07:31,727 --> 00:07:33,462
Listen, you like
game shows?

00:07:33,528 --> 00:07:35,097
Because I got a
deal; listen to this.

00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:39,234
First place is
a life-changing experience.

00:07:39,301 --> 00:07:40,602
You get a whole new life.

00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,838
What's second place?

00:07:42,904 --> 00:07:44,439
There is no
second place, Rat.

00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,508
Either way, you don't get
to work the alley anymore.

00:07:46,575 --> 00:07:47,776
Screw you.

00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:48,777
Screw me?

00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:50,479
No, no.

00:07:50,545 --> 00:07:52,814
Screw you. Look,
take my deal.

00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:55,417
Otherwise, you're
in possession

00:07:55,484 --> 00:07:56,585
of a controlled
substance,

00:07:56,651 --> 00:07:59,087
and with
your record,

00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:01,156
that's a mandatory sentence.
Okay.

00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:02,791
If you want information,
just ask me.

00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:03,892
Just that I'm...

00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,061
All right, let's
walk, walk with me.

00:08:06,128 --> 00:08:07,662
It's a little
complicated.

00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:08,964
You own a gun?

00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,566
That's K-E-P-P-L-E-R,
Michael Keppler.

00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:12,567
Yeah, check it out.

00:08:12,634 --> 00:08:13,869
Okay, I got to go.

00:08:13,935 --> 00:08:15,504
(hangs up phone)

00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:20,075
What's going on?

00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:23,545
Um, nothing I
can talk about.

00:08:23,612 --> 00:08:25,213
Keep me posted
on the 419.

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,282
Greg's going to meet
you at the scene.

00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:28,817
Okay.

00:08:32,954 --> 00:08:35,557
Ten to one,
it's Internal Affairs.

00:08:35,624 --> 00:08:37,893
Got a vibe off Keppler
the minute he blew in.

00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:39,327
Always with a suit.

00:08:40,695 --> 00:08:43,331
If you got any dirty laundry,
I hope you used bleach.

00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,029

00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:39,654

00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,800
(coughs)

00:09:58,006 --> 00:09:58,940
What?

00:09:59,007 --> 00:10:01,109
I'm CSI Stokes,
this is Brown.

00:10:02,444 --> 00:10:03,912
Where's your paperwork?

00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,781
We're from the crime lab,
dude.

00:10:05,847 --> 00:10:07,549
I still need paperwork.

00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:10,118
We're here to process those
stolen motorcycles, man.

00:10:10,185 --> 00:10:12,454
I need authorization,
fellas, in writing.

00:10:13,622 --> 00:10:15,290
Wh-What if,

00:10:15,357 --> 00:10:17,959
what if I promise to come
back and give it to you later?

00:10:18,026 --> 00:10:19,461
Okay, cut us
some slack here, man.

00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:21,830
You think we really feel
like being down here?

00:10:21,897 --> 00:10:23,999
How do you want to handle this?

00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:25,467
You want to shoot our way in?

00:10:25,534 --> 00:10:27,402
I'd love to bust a cap
in his knee.

00:10:27,469 --> 00:10:29,137
Sir, don't make us call
your supervisor.

00:10:29,204 --> 00:10:30,439
Now, come on.
(bangs on door)

00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:31,506
Come on!

00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,812
PHILLIPS:
We got third instar maggots.

00:10:36,878 --> 00:10:38,447
(exhales)

00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:41,116
With this smell, she's been dead
at least 48 hours.

00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:43,418
Toys are all here.

00:10:43,485 --> 00:10:46,722
Needle, syringe,
tubing, candle, spoon.

00:10:48,757 --> 00:10:50,425
It looks like heroin.

00:10:50,492 --> 00:10:52,461
CURTIS:
Manager said

00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,464
he found her like this
when he came by for a visit.

00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,199
Said they were friends,

00:10:57,265 --> 00:10:59,201
but he was a little unclear
of her name.

00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:00,969
Monique something or other.

00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:04,806
Maybe she was, uh,
working off the rent.

00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,508
No I.D. on the body.

00:11:06,575 --> 00:11:07,909
I'll take a look around for it.

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,315
Needle marks
are sclerotic.

00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,684
Chronic user. Probable O.D.

00:11:19,187 --> 00:11:20,222
(camera shutter clicking)

00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:21,490
SARA:
Scorpio.

00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,291
Ruled by Pluto.

00:11:23,358 --> 00:11:26,561
Athough since it's not
a planet anymore...

00:11:26,628 --> 00:11:28,363
I'm not sure how that works.

00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,798
Maybe it's a "dwarf" sign.

00:11:29,865 --> 00:11:32,467
Like Pluto is, you know,
a "dwarf" planet now.

00:11:35,637 --> 00:11:37,873
Car keys.

00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:39,107
Cell phone.

00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:42,811
No "Mom" or "Dad" listed.

00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,814
There's a lot of food
for a junkie.

00:11:45,881 --> 00:11:48,050
SARA:
Maybe she
had a roommate.

00:11:48,116 --> 00:11:51,086
Zamesca was shot three times
with a nine millimeter.

00:11:51,153 --> 00:11:54,022
We've got two sets
of shoe impressions.

00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:57,459
Two sets of tire
impressions.

00:11:57,526 --> 00:12:00,395
A plastic
"Jumbo Cola" cup.

00:12:00,462 --> 00:12:02,264
Drugs were found
in Zamesca's car,

00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,567
in plain view, but
his tox was negative.

00:12:05,634 --> 00:12:07,803
Drugs were planted.

00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:09,871
Crime scene was a
remote location.

00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,507
That's in our favor.

00:12:12,574 --> 00:12:13,942
Car was a bloody mess.

00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:19,181
Our "victim" was kind enough
to donate a pint of his blood.

00:12:19,247 --> 00:12:21,083
Did Mr. Holstein

00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:24,352
also donate his brain matter
and bone fragments?

00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:27,189
Brass recruited him
from Narco, undercover cop.

00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:29,257
Opted to keep his brains intact.

00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:33,729
Well, without actually
shooting the guy,

00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,731
this scene is going to be
slightly less than perfect,

00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:38,600
but it's just you and me
out there.
No, can't be.

00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:40,635
We're going to need a third
person processing the scene

00:12:40,702 --> 00:12:43,405
to make it look kosher--
someone who's not in on it.

00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:46,775
Well, if we use one of my guys,
they're going to figure it out.

00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:49,811
Keep them away from the car.

00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,384
I'm not used to faking it.

00:12:56,385 --> 00:12:58,520
When's the last time
you had to?

00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,246
Registration's expired.

00:13:27,312 --> 00:13:30,082
Want to bet she's not insured?

00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:34,019
Monique Carter.
155 North Court, Henderson.

00:13:34,086 --> 00:13:36,054
Oh, that's a good
neighborhood.

00:13:36,121 --> 00:13:38,290
Well, this used
to be a nice car.

00:13:38,357 --> 00:13:40,526
Maybe she traded in
her old lifestyle

00:13:40,592 --> 00:13:41,727
to ride the "H" train.

00:13:41,793 --> 00:13:43,495
Now, the manager wants
it out of here.

00:13:43,562 --> 00:13:45,964
So, I'll have it towed.

00:14:01,213 --> 00:14:03,081
It looks like an
impact from a weapon.

00:14:03,148 --> 00:14:05,450
Very good observation, David.

00:14:05,517 --> 00:14:07,486
Shave the area.
Call Sara.

00:14:07,553 --> 00:14:09,988
We may be looking
at a homicide.

00:14:49,261 --> 00:14:51,396
Hey, Henry.
Hey.

00:14:51,463 --> 00:14:54,800
It's heroin mixed
with cocaine and
methamphetamine.

00:14:54,867 --> 00:14:55,934
I was just
going to page you

00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:57,536
because these are
the same components

00:14:57,603 --> 00:15:00,005
from the drugs you
found in Zamesca's car.

00:15:00,072 --> 00:15:02,708
Really?
Should I call Sara?
It's her case.

00:15:02,774 --> 00:15:05,844
Henry, I need you to step out
and get a cup of coffee.

00:15:05,911 --> 00:15:07,446
Well, I can't leave
my evidence out.

00:15:07,513 --> 00:15:10,549
This is not a request.

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,578
Firing one.

00:15:39,645 --> 00:15:40,813
(fires gun)

00:15:53,058 --> 00:15:54,860
Is there a problem?

00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:58,664
F.Y.I., Bobby Dawson
is a bit of a control freak.

00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,566
Doesn't like anyone
in here unsupervised.

00:16:00,632 --> 00:16:02,534
So he got one accidental

00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:04,036
discharge on his record.

00:16:04,102 --> 00:16:05,504
I'm sure he doesn't
want another one.

00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:08,040
Unless...

00:16:08,106 --> 00:16:11,743
of course, this is an I.A.
investigation,

00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,612
and, uh, Bobby is his subject.

00:16:15,514 --> 00:16:16,849
Interesting
that Grissom,

00:16:16,915 --> 00:16:19,785
champion of the little guys,
is on sabbatical.

00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:24,289
Interesting, especially
if he planned it that way.

00:16:50,816 --> 00:16:53,986
This is my own blood, right?

00:16:54,052 --> 00:16:56,722
'Cause it's starting
to drip in my mouth.

00:16:56,788 --> 00:16:58,423
It's all yours.

00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,527
You can get out now,
Detective, and...

00:17:01,593 --> 00:17:04,229
I know, don't touch anything.
You got it.

00:17:04,296 --> 00:17:07,466
Oh, and there's some
fresh clothes in the
back of the vehicle.

00:17:07,533 --> 00:17:09,268
Got any brandy?
Sorry, man.

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,908
So, Mike,

00:17:15,974 --> 00:17:17,543
you said
reverse forensics

00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:19,545
didn't work in
Baltimore. How come?

00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:20,813
Smart cops.

00:17:24,016 --> 00:17:26,218
You steal cars
before you became a CSI?

00:17:27,786 --> 00:17:29,021
Stealing cars gets old fast.

00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,556
I like more of a challenge.

00:17:30,622 --> 00:17:32,891
Note to self.

00:17:37,629 --> 00:17:39,131
Okay, you can drop that cup now.

00:17:39,198 --> 00:17:40,732
Yeah, I'm not done yet.

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,501
He said drop it.

00:17:42,568 --> 00:17:44,636
About my new identity, um,

00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,472
I don't want to
go to Denver.

00:17:46,538 --> 00:17:48,006
I think I'd rather
go someplace

00:17:48,073 --> 00:17:50,776
where I'd fit in... like Maui.

00:17:50,843 --> 00:17:53,512
EZEKIEL:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:55,481
And I want a threesome with
Beyonce and Scarlett Johansson.

00:17:55,547 --> 00:17:58,417
Drop the cup and get your
rat ass in the car.

00:17:59,885 --> 00:18:01,053
I drop the cup.

00:18:11,363 --> 00:18:13,298
Casual.

00:18:13,365 --> 00:18:15,701
Excuse me?
Simon.

00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:18,070
His soda.

00:18:18,137 --> 00:18:20,339
He wasn't expecting trouble.

00:18:20,405 --> 00:18:22,608
KEPPLER:
<i>Get out of my car...</i>

00:18:22,674 --> 00:18:24,676
<i>walk over to Zamesca.</i>

00:18:24,743 --> 00:18:26,712
<i>Didn't come here to kill him...</i>

00:18:26,778 --> 00:18:27,913
<i>came to talk.</i>

00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,748
<i>Hand him the photo.</i>

00:18:29,815 --> 00:18:32,885
Then something doesn't
go as planned.

00:18:35,087 --> 00:18:36,455
<i>I drop the drink...</i>

00:18:37,456 --> 00:18:39,758
<i>grab my gun.</i>

00:18:42,027 --> 00:18:43,862
Murder was Plan B.

00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:45,564
Plan A was the photograph.

00:18:46,965 --> 00:18:49,001
Anti-drug crusader doing lines.

00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:50,502
Career buster.

00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:52,371
Looks like he
underestimated Zamesca.

00:18:52,437 --> 00:18:54,072
He was a hard
man to kill.

00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:56,175
Simon panicked.

00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:58,744
Which explains why he
left evidence behind this time.

00:18:58,811 --> 00:19:00,746
And why he had to disappear.

00:19:00,813 --> 00:19:02,614
And why we're
doing this.

00:19:09,354 --> 00:19:11,423
I'm going to call it in.

00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:19,064
DISPATCHER:
911, is this an emergency?

00:19:19,131 --> 00:19:20,299
Yes, someone's
been shot.

00:19:20,365 --> 00:19:23,068
I'm a quarter mile west of
Mountain's Edge and Durango.

00:19:23,135 --> 00:19:24,903
There's a man bleeding
from the head in his car.

00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,005
Looks like a gunshot wound,
but I didn't see a gun.

00:19:27,072 --> 00:19:28,340
He's dead for sure.

00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:30,242
Sir, may I have your name?
(phone beeps off)

00:19:33,445 --> 00:19:36,482
CONTROL:
<i>419, possible 420,</i>

00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:38,750
<i>quarter mile west</i>
<i>of Mountain's Edge and Durango.</i>

00:19:38,817 --> 00:19:41,987
<i>Possible man down,</i>
<i>gunshot wound to the head.</i>

00:19:42,054 --> 00:19:44,590
<i>2-0cean-2, 2-0cean-34,</i>
<i>please respond.</i>

00:19:44,656 --> 00:19:46,391
Show time.

00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,560
Control, this is 2-Zero-3,
Charlie-Captain-Brass.

00:19:48,627 --> 00:19:51,897
I am with Charlie-Zero-4-Willows
and Charlie-Zero-9-Keppler.

00:19:51,964 --> 00:19:53,398
We're around the corner.

00:19:53,465 --> 00:19:56,902
Our E.T.A. is five minutes.
We'll be responding also.

00:19:56,969 --> 00:20:00,139
DR. ROBBINS:
C.O.D. was blunt force trauma
to the right temporal region.

00:20:00,205 --> 00:20:03,542
(phone rings)
Wound's inconsistent
with a fall.

00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:04,977
(phone ringing)
You fall into something,

00:20:05,043 --> 00:20:07,479
say a coffee table, wound's
always deeper on one end.

00:20:07,546 --> 00:20:09,915
(phone ringing)
Depth here is uniform.

00:20:09,982 --> 00:20:12,017
(yelling):
Would somone please

00:20:12,084 --> 00:20:14,119
answer that phone?

00:20:14,186 --> 00:20:17,189
Sorry. Tox confirms
high level of heroin,

00:20:17,256 --> 00:20:19,758
cocaine, methamphetamine
in her system.

00:20:19,825 --> 00:20:22,995
I opened up her arm under
a fresh needle mark,

00:20:23,061 --> 00:20:25,497
drew out one milliliter
of dark liquid.

00:20:25,564 --> 00:20:26,665
The drugs were puddled.

00:20:26,732 --> 00:20:28,433
Means they
didn't circulate

00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,002
in her bloodstream.

00:20:30,068 --> 00:20:31,770
Injection was postmortem.

00:20:31,837 --> 00:20:33,438
Dead girls don't shoot up.

00:20:33,505 --> 00:20:35,007
PHILLIPS:
Sorry.

00:20:35,073 --> 00:20:37,309
Catherine needs to speak to you.
Says it's urgent.

00:20:37,376 --> 00:20:38,944
Right.

00:20:39,011 --> 00:20:41,547
ROBBINS:
I'm in the middle of an autopsy,
Catherine.

00:20:41,613 --> 00:20:43,549
Sorry. I'm at a 420.

00:20:43,615 --> 00:20:46,151
Similar M.O.to Zamesca.
Press is all over us.

00:20:46,218 --> 00:20:48,487
I need permission to get
the body out of here ASAP.

00:20:48,554 --> 00:20:50,389
That's fine. Just photograph
and diagram it

00:20:50,455 --> 00:20:51,890
before transporting.

00:20:51,957 --> 00:20:54,159
Of course. Now,
which mortuary's on call?

00:20:54,226 --> 00:20:56,061
Kentworth.
You have that number?

00:20:56,128 --> 00:20:58,831
I'll take care of it.
Thanks, Doc.

00:20:58,897 --> 00:21:01,533
NICK:
<i>This is so lame.</i>

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,969
How much do you want to bet half
the prints come back to the cops

00:21:04,036 --> 00:21:06,371
who recovered these bikes.
They never wear gloves.

00:21:06,438 --> 00:21:08,807
Brown.

00:21:08,874 --> 00:21:11,043
Hey, Cath.

00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:12,711
We'll see you there.

00:21:12,778 --> 00:21:15,214
Well, in that case...

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,748
I'll see you there.

00:21:16,815 --> 00:21:20,085
Boy, she has got it
in for me today.

00:21:20,152 --> 00:21:22,554
Well, giddyup.

00:21:22,621 --> 00:21:24,156
(laughs)

00:21:31,463 --> 00:21:34,032
WARRICK:
CSI coming through.

00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:36,668
Thank you.

00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,549
Where's the body?
Called the morticians

00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:51,783
to get it out of here.

00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,851
Gunshot victim.

00:21:52,918 --> 00:21:54,419
Got I.D.?

00:21:54,486 --> 00:21:56,421
Ezekiel Holstein.

00:21:56,488 --> 00:21:57,556
Local.

00:21:57,623 --> 00:21:59,224
Brass is running him now.

00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,262
Hey, Cath, didn't you find
Zamesca near here?

00:22:03,328 --> 00:22:05,063
Yeah.

00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,765
Got the "Jumbo" cup.

00:22:06,832 --> 00:22:09,001
Shoe and tire
impressions.

00:22:09,067 --> 00:22:10,402
Shot in his car.

00:22:10,469 --> 00:22:12,971
Think Simon's coming out
of hiding?

00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:14,907
Or it's a copycat.

00:22:14,973 --> 00:22:17,276
Want me to take
the backseat?

00:22:17,342 --> 00:22:18,443
No, um,

00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,280
take the perimeter,
get started on a diagram.

00:22:21,346 --> 00:22:22,815
Okay, Sarge.

00:22:22,881 --> 00:22:24,783
Not my first barbecue.

00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,652
Thanks, Warrick.
REPORTER:
Undersheriff McKeen,

00:22:26,718 --> 00:22:28,487
is this related
to the Zamesca murder?

00:22:28,554 --> 00:22:29,721
We're in the process

00:22:29,788 --> 00:22:30,823
of conducting
an investigation,

00:22:30,889 --> 00:22:32,257
so I don't have
all the facts.

00:22:32,324 --> 00:22:34,359
But there does appear
to be some similarities

00:22:34,426 --> 00:22:35,894
to Assemblyman Zamesca's murder.

00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:38,997
UNDERSHERIFF MCKEEN:
Uh, I have no further
comments at this time.

00:22:39,064 --> 00:22:40,265
BRASS:
Ezekiel Holstein.

00:22:40,332 --> 00:22:43,602
Date of birth: 07-14-72.

00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:45,504
Do a records check.

00:22:45,571 --> 00:22:48,474
Oh, and, uh,
contact Narco.

00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,075
May be drug-related.

00:22:51,643 --> 00:22:53,712
I really feel good
about this.

00:22:59,215 --> 00:23:01,183
APARTMENT MANAGER:
<i>Monique's dead body</i>

00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,252
means I got to get
the carpet cleaned.

00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:05,154
You said
the scene was clear,

00:23:05,221 --> 00:23:07,123
I called
the cleaning service.

00:23:07,189 --> 00:23:08,591
It's a good way
to cover your tracks.

00:23:08,657 --> 00:23:09,725
Like I said,

00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:12,128
she'd been shacked up
with some guy.

00:23:12,194 --> 00:23:13,696
Can you describe him?

00:23:13,763 --> 00:23:18,000
Average-looking,
white dude.

00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:20,403
I only saw him
from a distance.

00:23:20,469 --> 00:23:21,904
He was driving
her car.

00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:27,543
Look, she was a nice,
smart lady.

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,513
She helped me get out of a jam
with my insurance company.

00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:33,883
I know she liked
the "candy",

00:23:33,949 --> 00:23:37,420
but she did not deserve
to go out that way.

00:23:37,486 --> 00:23:38,988
SANDERS:
<i>I ran Monique</i>

00:23:39,055 --> 00:23:40,289
Carter's phone
records.

00:23:40,356 --> 00:23:43,592
Someone made a dozen calls
from her cell yesterday.

00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:44,794
She was dead yesterday.

00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,162
Yeah, and we recovered
her phone

00:23:46,228 --> 00:23:47,797
from her apartment,
so someone was yakking

00:23:47,863 --> 00:23:49,665
while she was lying dead
on the floor dead.

00:23:49,732 --> 00:23:51,233
Let's run those numbers.

00:23:59,075 --> 00:24:01,777
HODGES:
Hey, how's the King
of property crimes?

00:24:01,844 --> 00:24:04,046
My socks keep disappearing
in the dryer.

00:24:04,113 --> 00:24:05,414
You want to
tackle that one?

00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:07,717
What are you doing with the cup
from my Zamesca scene?

00:24:07,783 --> 00:24:08,984
That's not your cup.

00:24:09,051 --> 00:24:11,020
It's from Catherine
and Warrick's 420.

00:24:11,087 --> 00:24:14,123
They found the same kind
of cup at their scene?

00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,391
Same everything.

00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:16,659
Watch the news lately?

00:24:22,431 --> 00:24:24,367
Hey, what about my socks?

00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:26,335
They're not gonna
find themselves.

00:24:44,286 --> 00:24:46,288
Uh, excuse me.

00:24:46,355 --> 00:24:49,291
Uh, what are you doing?

00:24:49,358 --> 00:24:52,261
Hi, Mike Keppler.

00:24:52,328 --> 00:24:54,263
Sorry, didn't get a chance
to introduce myself

00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:57,800
before I, uh, invaded your lab.

00:24:57,867 --> 00:25:00,636
Uh, well, can I help you
with something?

00:25:00,703 --> 00:25:03,172
Yeah, I'm looking for the
ballistics on Holstein.

00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:05,441
Uh, yeah, just about
to run them.

00:25:05,508 --> 00:25:06,676
Great.

00:25:06,742 --> 00:25:08,811
Mind if I sit in?

00:25:27,229 --> 00:25:28,497
Bullet that killed

00:25:28,564 --> 00:25:31,801
Holstein was a nine-mill,
same caliber as Zamesca,

00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:33,002
but no match.

00:25:33,069 --> 00:25:34,437
Killer could have
used a different gun.

00:25:34,503 --> 00:25:35,971
Thanks, Bobby.

00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:38,007
See you later.

00:25:41,744 --> 00:25:43,279
Hey, Doc.
Hey, Nick.

00:25:43,346 --> 00:25:45,348
Want you to catch me up
with Catherine and Warrick.

00:25:45,414 --> 00:25:47,249
I haven't seen them.

00:25:47,316 --> 00:25:49,051
Where's the body
from their 420?

00:25:49,118 --> 00:25:50,386
Uh, it hasn't come in yet.

00:25:50,453 --> 00:25:51,620
It was a mortuary pickup.

00:25:51,687 --> 00:25:53,122
Who's this?

00:25:53,189 --> 00:25:55,091
It's Monique Carter.

00:25:55,157 --> 00:25:57,827
Heroin addict, got
whacked on the head.

00:26:00,129 --> 00:26:02,131
She involved
with Catherine's 420?

00:26:02,198 --> 00:26:05,368
If she was, nobody told me.

00:26:07,203 --> 00:26:09,405
Will you send me a photo
of this tattoo?

00:26:09,472 --> 00:26:10,639
And when the body comes in
at the mortuary,

00:26:10,706 --> 00:26:11,640
will you give me a call?

00:26:11,707 --> 00:26:13,376
I'll get right on it.

00:26:18,581 --> 00:26:20,549
Seat's been pushed
all the way back.

00:26:20,616 --> 00:26:22,985
Manager said he saw
a guy driving.

00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,899
She was a lawyer.

00:26:36,966 --> 00:26:39,769
Suspended for failure
to pay her

00:26:39,835 --> 00:26:41,103
Bar Association dues.

00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,738
Lose all that to drugs,

00:26:42,805 --> 00:26:44,373
you gotta be in a lot of pain.

00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,043
Or you think you're too smart
to get addicted.

00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:48,277
You guys seen
Catherine around?

00:26:48,344 --> 00:26:49,912
She's not answering
her cell phone.
Mm-mm.

00:26:49,979 --> 00:26:53,749
Anything from your scene
link back to Zamesca?

00:26:53,816 --> 00:26:54,984
No. Why?

00:26:55,051 --> 00:26:56,419
Because I think
your d.b.'s

00:26:56,485 --> 00:26:58,554
the unidentified woman
in the photo I found.

00:26:58,621 --> 00:26:59,889
Really?

00:27:03,025 --> 00:27:04,660
And, excuse me,

00:27:04,727 --> 00:27:07,430
we found this same type

00:27:07,496 --> 00:27:10,099
of material
at the Zamesca scene.

00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:11,901
If we can match it
back to this car...

00:27:11,967 --> 00:27:13,569
You could place the car
at the scene.

00:27:13,636 --> 00:27:15,738
And Simon
behind the wheel.

00:27:15,805 --> 00:27:16,939
Got a partial print

00:27:17,006 --> 00:27:18,908
off the straw
from the soda cup.

00:27:18,974 --> 00:27:22,011
AFIS hit Edwin Dennison,
aka "Rat".

00:27:25,114 --> 00:27:27,049
Small-time drug dealer
with a big-time rap sheet.

00:27:27,116 --> 00:27:29,552
Well, I'll get Brass
to bring him in, huh?

00:27:29,618 --> 00:27:31,821
Nice work.

00:27:33,856 --> 00:27:36,692
I just connected Sara's vic
to Simon.

00:27:38,828 --> 00:27:41,931
Yeah, you might want
to hear this.

00:27:41,998 --> 00:27:43,165
BROWN:
What's the connection?

00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,500
Well, I think,

00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:48,270
that Simon was driving her BMW
to meet Zamesca.

00:27:48,337 --> 00:27:51,440
Nick, we got a print
from the Holstein case.

00:27:51,507 --> 00:27:52,708
Street dealer.

00:27:52,775 --> 00:27:53,909
We're bringing him in now.

00:27:53,976 --> 00:27:56,445
And he looks dirty
for Zamesca, too.

00:27:56,512 --> 00:27:58,114
Excuse me.

00:27:59,749 --> 00:28:00,983
I grew up in this town.

00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,318
I know about
playing the odds.

00:28:02,385 --> 00:28:03,886
You are gambling
with my team.

00:28:03,953 --> 00:28:06,188
We talked about
the risk going in.

00:28:06,255 --> 00:28:07,890
It's not like we
can quit now.

00:28:07,957 --> 00:28:08,958
I'm not quitting.

00:28:09,025 --> 00:28:10,359
But I don't like it.

00:28:10,426 --> 00:28:12,595
And I hate lying
to my guys.

00:28:16,499 --> 00:28:19,068
(reporters clamoring)

00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,706
REPORTER:
Mr. Dennison, could
we have a comment?

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,515
Is this relating
to the...

00:28:32,581 --> 00:28:34,517
Good afternoon.

00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:37,219
The Las Vegas
Police Department

00:28:37,286 --> 00:28:39,955
has successfully apprehended
a suspect, one Edwin Dennison,

00:28:40,022 --> 00:28:42,324
who's confessed
of multiple homicides,

00:28:42,391 --> 00:28:45,494
including that
of Assemblyman Danilo Zamesca.

00:28:45,561 --> 00:28:49,131
Mr. Dennison admitted
to luring Mr. Zamesca

00:28:49,198 --> 00:28:50,533
to a remote location,

00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:53,035
while seeking his help
to escape the drug trade.

00:28:53,102 --> 00:28:56,706
When Mr. Zamesca encouraged him
to surrender to police,

00:28:56,772 --> 00:28:58,341
Mr. Dennison shot him.

00:28:58,407 --> 00:29:00,209
He later shot Mr. Holstein

00:29:00,276 --> 00:29:02,211
during a dispute
over a drug deal.

00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:04,780
I'd like to say
how very proud I am

00:29:04,847 --> 00:29:07,249
of the swift and efficient work
done that my department has done

00:29:07,316 --> 00:29:08,451
in tracking down

00:29:08,517 --> 00:29:11,020
and apprehending
this dangerous criminal...

00:29:20,629 --> 00:29:21,998
You know that Dawson guy
gets kind of uptight

00:29:22,064 --> 00:29:23,099
when people touch his stuff.

00:29:25,134 --> 00:29:28,637
Well, the Holstein scene
bullet was fired

00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,806
from the same gun that you found
in Rat's car.

00:29:32,408 --> 00:29:33,409
(fires gun)

00:29:35,745 --> 00:29:37,313
Done deal.

00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,414
I'm not so sure.

00:29:38,481 --> 00:29:40,082
If this bullet went through
the window

00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:41,484
and a guy's head...

00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,085
it would have pieces of glass

00:29:43,152 --> 00:29:44,453
<i>and bits of bone in it.</i>

00:29:49,925 --> 00:29:51,193
This hollow point's clean.

00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,561
There's no sand-blasted effect.

00:29:52,628 --> 00:29:54,497
Hmm.

00:29:54,563 --> 00:29:56,365
The DNA sample yet,

00:29:56,432 --> 00:29:58,234
might have been
cleaned already.

00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,869
There's still blood on it.

00:29:59,935 --> 00:30:02,338
I see your point.

00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,275
Maybe autopsy will show
something.

00:30:12,314 --> 00:30:14,250
Hey, Nick.

00:30:15,284 --> 00:30:16,886
I can't find the evidence

00:30:16,952 --> 00:30:18,821
in the Holstein case.

00:30:18,888 --> 00:30:20,890
What do you want it for?

00:30:20,956 --> 00:30:24,326
Because that guy who confessed
to killing Zamesca didn't do it.

00:30:24,393 --> 00:30:25,728
Sheriff's jumping the gun.

00:30:25,795 --> 00:30:27,596
We have evidence
and a confession.

00:30:27,663 --> 00:30:29,932
You can't just come in here
and take over my case.

00:30:31,967 --> 00:30:36,339
Is there a reason you don't want
me to see that file, Catherine?

00:30:36,405 --> 00:30:39,842
Nick, as your supervisor,
I'm ordering you to back off.

00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,252
Thanks.

00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,754
Uh, it's freezing.

00:30:51,821 --> 00:30:53,789
Why are we having
a meeting outside?

00:30:53,856 --> 00:30:55,524
'Cause Catherine
and Keppler are in there.

00:30:55,591 --> 00:30:57,393
What, have you guys been
listening to Hodges?

00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,994
No, and this isn't

00:30:59,061 --> 00:31:00,463
about Keppler being I.A. anyway.

00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:02,798
This is about Catherine having
a false confession

00:31:02,865 --> 00:31:04,300
and standing by it.

00:31:04,367 --> 00:31:06,802
You'd better be able
to back that one up, man.

00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:08,337
Zamesca knew Sara
and Greg's vic.

00:31:08,404 --> 00:31:09,972
He's dead, she's dead,
same drugs are found

00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:11,974
at both scenes,
and then...

00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:14,377
those same drugs showed up
at your crime scene?

00:31:14,443 --> 00:31:16,512
Could have come
from the same supplier.

00:31:16,579 --> 00:31:17,747
We see that
all the time.

00:31:17,813 --> 00:31:19,548
I don't think
it's a coincidence.

00:31:19,615 --> 00:31:22,184
You know, Catherine...

00:31:22,251 --> 00:31:25,621
Catherine ordered Henry
to step out of his lab

00:31:25,688 --> 00:31:27,323
without putting drug
evidence away.

00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,725
Why would she do that?

00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:32,128
I did see Keppler checking out
Zamesca's file yesterday.

00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:34,997
I didn't think anything strange
about it then,

00:31:35,064 --> 00:31:36,832
but now...
Okay, so...

00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:40,202
maybe there is
an I.A. investigation

00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:42,238
I can't find
the Holstein evidence.

00:31:42,304 --> 00:31:43,072
What?

00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:44,373
Catherine

00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,208
put it in a temporary locker.

00:31:46,275 --> 00:31:48,644
Why didn't she put it
where it belongs?

00:31:48,711 --> 00:31:52,715
The Holstein bullet was
a little bit too clean,

00:31:52,782 --> 00:31:54,884
and Keppler didn't seem
at all concerned about it.

00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,053
He said that we would see
at autopsy.

00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,055
Well, it's kind of hard
to have an autopsy

00:31:59,121 --> 00:32:00,756
when you don't
have a body, man.

00:32:00,823 --> 00:32:03,592
I talked to Doc Robbins, he's
still trying to track it down.

00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:04,827
And the mortuary has no record

00:32:04,894 --> 00:32:07,196
of Catherine's phone
call whatsoever.

00:32:07,263 --> 00:32:09,732
Do we have access to any
of the Holstein evidence?

00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:11,801
We got the car.

00:32:14,403 --> 00:32:16,372
Catherine sent it
to the impound.

00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:18,207
Well, at least we
know where it is.

00:32:18,274 --> 00:32:21,177
All right, that's it, we're
a team now, the four of us.

00:32:21,243 --> 00:32:24,213
We can't trust Catherine
and we can't trust Keppler.

00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,781
I'm serious.

00:32:27,516 --> 00:32:28,718
I'm gonna run with this one.

00:32:28,784 --> 00:32:31,253
I'll run with you.

00:32:32,421 --> 00:32:33,823
You?

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,794
I'm in.

00:32:52,288 --> 00:32:54,190
Hey. Hey, you!

00:32:54,256 --> 00:32:57,259

Hey, Warrick, it's Nick.

00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:48,677
When is the last time you found
high-velocity exit spatter

00:33:48,744 --> 00:33:50,446
with no brain and no bone?

00:33:50,513 --> 00:33:52,114
Never.

00:33:52,181 --> 00:33:53,382
Got the evidence yet?
(knocking)

00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:54,617
You know what? Sara's here.

00:33:54,683 --> 00:33:56,051
And she has the key.

00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:58,454
Got to go.

00:33:58,521 --> 00:34:01,123
You know...
I really hate

00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,459
deceiving people
because, eventually,

00:34:03,526 --> 00:34:04,994
you get what you give.

00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,129
I hate being deceived.

00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:16,539
Yes.

00:34:18,174 --> 00:34:19,341

The blood found

had high levels
of EDTA.

00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:15,191
Anti-coagulant.

00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:17,793
Means the blood didn't come from
his head; it came from his arm.

That means
this crime scene was staged.

You dropped

You never cleared this operation
with the D.A.,

00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:16,745
and now, she says she can't tell
fact from fiction.

00:38:16,812 --> 00:38:18,914
She's not going to file charges
against Simon.

00:38:18,981 --> 00:38:21,250
She's a tight-ass--
I told her what I thought

she needed to know.

00:38:35,498 --> 00:38:37,867
It's called reverse forensics.

00:38:37,933 --> 00:38:40,169
Reverse forensics?

00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:42,538
Simon had to believe it
when he saw it on the news.

00:38:42,605 --> 00:38:43,672
He was a fugitive.

00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:45,941
The only way to get him
to show his face was

00:38:46,008 --> 00:38:47,743
to make him think
he was off the hook.

00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,779
And your only option was

00:38:49,845 --> 00:38:52,281
to fabricate evidence
and make me process it?

00:38:52,348 --> 00:38:53,749
How could you think

00:38:53,816 --> 00:38:54,984
that we wouldn't figure it out?

00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,019
It's kind of what we do.

00:38:57,086 --> 00:38:58,454
I understand how you all feel.

00:38:58,521 --> 00:39:00,689

00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:18,240

He only walked on Zamesca.

00:39:30,886 --> 00:39:33,489
He drove Monique Carter's
vehicle out into the desert.

00:39:33,556 --> 00:39:35,458
Nick's established that.

00:39:37,193 --> 00:39:39,094

00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,535
So, what did the
cleaners miss?

00:40:20,569 --> 00:40:22,972
There used to be a pillow here.

00:40:23,038 --> 00:40:23,973
Maybe...

00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:25,074

Today, Thomas Simon,

(sighs)

00:42:48,751 --> 00:42:50,920
Guess it helps me
to think like one.

00:42:55,257 --> 00:42:58,627
You want to, uh, get
a drink or something?

00:42:58,694 --> 00:42:59,628
Nah.

00:42:59,695 --> 00:43:01,030
No, I'm, I'm tired.

00:43:01,096 --> 00:43:02,465
I'm going home.
Nick.

00:43:02,531 --> 00:43:04,366
Nick!

00:43:07,336 --> 00:43:09,805
Let it go, man.

00:43:16,212 --> 00:43:19,348
Tonight we're talking about the
anti-drug legislation

00:43:19,415 --> 00:43:23,085
sponsored by the late Assemblyman
Danilo Zamesca.

00:43:23,152 --> 00:43:27,156
It was passed into law today
by the Nevada State Legislature.

00:43:27,223 --> 00:43:29,525
Tony from Seven Hills,
you're on the air.
