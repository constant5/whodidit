00:00:02,666 --> 00:00:04,701
(siren wailing)

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,343
Fellas, another incident
at Lolita's.

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,644
What now?

00:00:14,711 --> 00:00:17,781
An erotic athlete
claiming a 420-Z.

00:00:17,847 --> 00:00:19,683
The paramedics have
her on a stretcher.

00:00:19,749 --> 00:00:22,052
What the hell's
an erotic athlete?

00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:24,921
Well, I hope it's a tight end
in a G-string.

00:00:24,988 --> 00:00:26,423
Nice.
(laughs)

00:00:28,024 --> 00:00:29,159
Greg?
Yeah.

00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:32,028
419 at Tagliferri's
restaurant on 8th Avenue.

00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:33,630
All right.

00:00:33,697 --> 00:00:35,031
Thanks.
I'm on it.

00:00:35,098 --> 00:00:36,366
Cath?
Huh?

00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:38,969
415-B at the HaHaHa.

00:00:39,035 --> 00:00:41,037
What's the weapon?

00:00:41,104 --> 00:00:42,839
A Taser? Come on!

00:00:42,906 --> 00:00:45,041
An angry clown got pissed
at some heckler

00:00:45,108 --> 00:00:47,477
with clogged arteries,
and it caused a heart attack.

00:00:47,544 --> 00:00:49,846
So, Greg-O gets a hit
at a mob restaurant,

00:00:49,913 --> 00:00:52,449
and I get a clown
who can't take a joke?

00:00:52,515 --> 00:00:54,384
Trust me, you don't want
Greg's 419.

00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:56,119
SIDLE:
Hey. Hey.

00:00:56,186 --> 00:00:57,487
Hey.

00:00:57,554 --> 00:00:59,923
CDC needs someone out
at the Omdi-Tech offices

00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,324
on Boulder Highway.

00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:02,826
I'm sure it's not hazardous,

00:01:02,892 --> 00:01:04,661
or they wouldn't
let us collect it.

00:01:04,728 --> 00:01:06,329
Okay. You
coming with?

00:01:06,396 --> 00:01:08,265
No, I'm spending
the night in autopsy

00:01:08,331 --> 00:01:09,566
with the Lake Mead floater.

00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:10,834
Well, enjoy.

00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:12,035
That guy was putrid.

00:01:12,102 --> 00:01:13,303
Oh, by the way...

00:01:30,086 --> 00:01:32,088
(touch tones beeping)

00:01:40,363 --> 00:01:42,966
(phone beeps open)

00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:45,168
(phone ringing)

00:01:47,604 --> 00:01:50,507
(monkey laughing)

00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:03,219
HODGES:
Four crime scene miniatures,

00:02:03,286 --> 00:02:05,322
four murder victims,

00:02:05,388 --> 00:02:09,192
and one diabolical killer
with an obsessive streak

00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,361
who still remains at large.

00:02:14,698 --> 00:02:17,133
I don't know if any
of you have noticed

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,336
how distracted
Grissom's been lately,

00:02:19,402 --> 00:02:20,604
but it's these.

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,672
Keeping him up at night.

00:02:24,374 --> 00:02:26,309
You know
the combination?

00:02:26,376 --> 00:02:27,877
Of course.

00:02:27,944 --> 00:02:30,247
Grissom could use some
fresh eyes on the case,

00:02:30,313 --> 00:02:32,082
and that's why
I've asked you here.

00:02:32,148 --> 00:02:33,416
Obviously,
this could be perceived

00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:34,818
as insulting
to the CSIs

00:02:34,884 --> 00:02:36,286
who formerly worked the case,

00:02:36,353 --> 00:02:39,289
so secrecy is
of the utmost importance.

00:02:39,356 --> 00:02:40,690
Double down low.

00:02:40,757 --> 00:02:41,992
WEBSTER: (British accent):
Oh, James,

00:02:42,058 --> 00:02:43,260
it's Moneypenny.

00:02:43,326 --> 00:02:44,961
M needs you back at HQ.

00:02:45,028 --> 00:02:46,663
Shoe phone was <i>Get Smart,</i>
though.

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,831
Oh, that's right.

00:02:47,898 --> 00:02:49,432
99 was so hot.
Mm.

00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:50,667
Four people are dead,

00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:52,836
the killer is still out there,
and you're mocking?

00:02:52,903 --> 00:02:54,004
We're mocking you.

00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,473
Ah. You in or out?

00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:58,375
I don't really
know anything
about these cases.

00:02:58,441 --> 00:02:59,342
We'll review.

00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:01,044
I don't know.
I have a lot of work to do.

00:03:01,111 --> 00:03:04,381
And by work, you mean
IM'ing your Icelandic pen pal

00:03:04,447 --> 00:03:06,316
who thinks that you look
like Warrick Brown because

00:03:06,383 --> 00:03:07,617
that's the picture
you posted.

00:03:07,684 --> 00:03:08,685
How...?

00:03:08,752 --> 00:03:09,920
I just know.

00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:12,055
Archie, in?

00:03:12,122 --> 00:03:14,224
What the hell, but
I got to leave early.

00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,159
I got a surfing trip
in Santa Barbara

00:03:16,226 --> 00:03:18,528
this weekend.
Miss Mockery?

00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:21,064
Well, we can't leave the lab,
we can't talk to suspects.

00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:23,533
What exactly does Grissom
wants us to do?
It's not always

00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,735
what you look at that matters,
it's what you see.

00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:27,671
That's Thoreau.

00:03:27,737 --> 00:03:28,805
Oh, is it? Hmm.

00:03:28,872 --> 00:03:30,840
JOHNSON:
Okay, Professor.

00:03:30,907 --> 00:03:32,976
And your point would be?

00:03:33,043 --> 00:03:36,246
The answers lie in these.

00:03:40,483 --> 00:03:42,152
We're lab techs.

00:03:42,218 --> 00:03:43,920
We think differently
than field guys.

00:03:43,987 --> 00:03:46,323
They deal with people,
we deal with things.

00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:48,658
Maybe we can't find the killer,

00:03:48,725 --> 00:03:50,527
but I think
we can find

00:03:50,594 --> 00:03:52,629
the thing that links
all four murders.

00:03:53,964 --> 00:03:56,266
This is an
opportunity.

00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,068
We have one shift
to show Grissom

00:03:58,134 --> 00:03:59,336
what we're made of.

00:03:59,402 --> 00:04:01,238
Tonight, we could be heroes.

00:04:02,405 --> 00:04:04,474
All right, all right.

00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,775
I'm in.

00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:12,515

The first miniature was found

00:05:45,206 --> 00:05:47,007
at the crime scene
seven months ago.

00:05:47,074 --> 00:05:50,478
The victim is Izzy Delancy,
washed-up rock star.

00:05:50,544 --> 00:05:52,880
<i>Blunt force trauma</i>
<i>to the back of the head.</i>

00:05:52,947 --> 00:05:55,649
Bonked with a rolling pin,
found in the drawer

00:05:55,716 --> 00:05:57,485
at the scene.
Stalker maybe?

00:05:57,551 --> 00:05:59,253
Izzy didn't have
any known stalkers,

00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,621
and there was no
forced entry.

00:06:00,688 --> 00:06:03,090
Suspects include
his first wife,

00:06:03,157 --> 00:06:05,059
his current wife,
the nanny he was schtuping

00:06:05,126 --> 00:06:06,227
and his teenage son.

00:06:06,293 --> 00:06:08,262
Motive thought to be sex?

00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:09,463
And-or money.

00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,065
Izzy's music library
was for sale.

00:06:11,132 --> 00:06:12,566
<i>Mucho dinero</i>
to be gained.

00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:13,634
So?
So...

00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:15,236
nothing.

00:06:15,302 --> 00:06:17,104
Every suspect was exonerated.

00:06:17,171 --> 00:06:19,106
All we were
left with

00:06:19,173 --> 00:06:20,674
was this...

00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:24,011
GRISSOM:
A perfect, half-inch scale model
of the room.

00:06:24,078 --> 00:06:26,013
And assuming that the killer
is the same person

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,815
who made the miniature...

00:06:27,882 --> 00:06:31,318
It would have taken weeks,
maybe even months to create

00:06:31,385 --> 00:06:33,854
with this kind of detail.

00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:36,056
It certainly qualifies
as premeditation.

00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:48,102
It's real blood.

00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:49,336
<i>The killer actually</i>
<i>stuck around</i>

00:06:49,403 --> 00:06:52,106
<i>to match the blood pool</i>
<i>at the scene.</i>

00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:54,708
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:56,110
What?

00:06:56,177 --> 00:06:57,678
What are you doing?

00:06:57,745 --> 00:06:58,546
Sitting.

00:06:58,612 --> 00:07:00,614
No, no. You're tempting fate.

00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:02,950
You know how
you should never try on

00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:04,118
someone else's
engagement ring,

00:07:04,185 --> 00:07:05,586
hold the Oscar,
use the excuse

00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:07,288
that your grandmother died
when she didn't...

00:07:07,354 --> 00:07:08,956
WEBSTER: I tried on
Suzie Quinceworthy's

00:07:09,023 --> 00:07:10,124
diamond ring
last year.

00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:12,526
It looked really good on her,
and looked terrible on me.

00:07:12,593 --> 00:07:13,994
I don't think an
emerald cut flatters

00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:15,162
my little ten-ies.

00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:17,631
Will I never marry?
I'll marry you.

00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:19,366
Although, you know, my
grandmother's still alive.

00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:20,501
She lives down in Boca.

00:07:20,568 --> 00:07:22,136
I don't know if you know this,

00:07:22,203 --> 00:07:23,537
but I am
the shuffleboard champion

00:07:23,604 --> 00:07:25,372
of the Boca Surf
and Sand.
Mm.

00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,007
Lady killer of the senior set.

00:07:27,074 --> 00:07:29,176
Rock on.
I can do an open marriage.

00:07:29,243 --> 00:07:30,478
Why do you guys keep doing that?

00:07:30,544 --> 00:07:31,645
Do what?

00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:33,481
JOHNSON:
Hodges, relax, man.

00:07:33,547 --> 00:07:35,483
I don't want to run the lab.

00:07:35,549 --> 00:07:37,585
We are guests
in the man's office.

00:07:37,651 --> 00:07:39,753
If there was one person
who was more respectful

00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,489
of space and boundaries,
it's Grissom.

00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:43,057
You could at least

00:07:43,123 --> 00:07:44,558
offer him the same courtesy.

00:07:47,294 --> 00:07:48,429
Wait.

00:07:48,496 --> 00:07:50,598
Is he okay
with us being in here?

00:07:50,664 --> 00:07:52,867
He said he'd be in Autopsy,
won't be back for hours.

00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:55,936
Anyway, they never solved

00:07:56,003 --> 00:07:56,937
Izzy Delancy's murder.

00:07:57,004 --> 00:07:58,339
Two months later,

00:07:58,405 --> 00:08:00,341
Penny Garden was found dead
in her house.

00:08:00,407 --> 00:08:03,911
(thunder rumbles, record plays
scratchy '50s record)

00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:15,122
(rolling thunder)

00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:28,869
(sighs)

00:08:28,936 --> 00:08:31,405
(rolling thunder)

00:08:36,677 --> 00:08:38,979
(record continues playing)

00:08:43,517 --> 00:08:45,519
(crackling thunder)

00:08:54,962 --> 00:08:57,298
WEBSTER:
<i>Suspects included</i>
<i>her ex-junkie</i>

00:08:57,364 --> 00:08:58,532
nephew who was
living with her,

00:08:58,599 --> 00:08:59,600
and her drug-dealing
neighbor,

00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:01,435
who was buying
prescription meds from her.

00:09:01,502 --> 00:09:03,337
Obvious motives--
drugs and money.

00:09:03,404 --> 00:09:05,339
Did either of them have
any connection to Izzy Delancy?

00:09:05,406 --> 00:09:06,240
No.

00:09:06,307 --> 00:09:07,641
CSIs didn't
even realize

00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,777
this was a Miniature case
until this was

00:09:09,844 --> 00:09:11,979
anonymously delivered
to the scene the next day.

00:09:12,046 --> 00:09:14,849
And why wasn't it left with
the body like the other one?

00:09:14,915 --> 00:09:16,116
Good question.

00:09:16,183 --> 00:09:18,519
Grissom and I really noodled
over that one.

00:09:18,586 --> 00:09:21,455
Look carefully at
the back of the doll,

00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:24,525
and at the pillow
on the chair.

00:09:24,592 --> 00:09:26,193
There appears
to be remnants

00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,629
of glue on both.

00:09:28,696 --> 00:09:31,165
So the doll was originally

00:09:31,232 --> 00:09:33,400
glued to the back
of the chair.

00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,306
I think the killer expected
the victim to die

00:09:39,373 --> 00:09:41,509
in this chair.

00:09:56,123 --> 00:09:57,458
Well, if that's the case,

00:09:57,525 --> 00:10:02,029
then how did the killer expect
to... kill her?

00:10:08,302 --> 00:10:10,571
HODGES:
<i>The killer knew</i>
<i>that Penny was always stinko</i>

00:10:10,638 --> 00:10:14,341
<i>on Cherry Herring</i>
<i>by coupon-clipping time, so...</i>

00:10:14,408 --> 00:10:16,577
ANDREWS:
<i>He laced her booze</i>
<i>with liquid nicotine,</i>

00:10:16,644 --> 00:10:19,580
<i>which induced convulsions.</i>

00:10:19,647 --> 00:10:21,348
(coughing)

00:10:21,415 --> 00:10:24,552
JOHNSON:
<i>And when she went all twitchy</i>
<i>and through the window...</i>

00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:29,156
WEBSTER:
<i>The OCD killer had</i>
<i>to match it with his mini,</i>

00:10:29,223 --> 00:10:30,758
which is why
it showed up late.

00:10:31,592 --> 00:10:32,860
Red dog barks at midnight.

00:10:34,495 --> 00:10:36,730
What are you guys doing in here?

00:10:36,797 --> 00:10:39,033
Nothing.
Yeah.

00:10:46,574 --> 00:10:49,076
All right, freakboy, your phone
has been ringing off the hook,

00:10:49,143 --> 00:10:51,178
so I finally answered it,
and Warrick and Nick said

00:10:51,245 --> 00:10:52,346
they have a ton of trace,

00:10:52,413 --> 00:10:53,747
and they really need you
to clear the decks.

00:10:53,814 --> 00:10:55,983
No problem.

00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:58,285
After you.

00:10:58,352 --> 00:10:59,987
After you.

00:11:13,734 --> 00:11:16,871
Hmm. Irides brown.

00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:21,909
No apparent puncture wounds,
abrasions or lacerations.

00:11:21,976 --> 00:11:24,545
COD appears
to be drowning.

00:11:24,612 --> 00:11:27,047
We did pull him out
of Lake Mead you know.

00:11:27,114 --> 00:11:30,050
Right. Based on decomp,

00:11:30,117 --> 00:11:33,854
I'd put TOD around
48 hours ago.

00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:38,926
Where's his head, David?

00:11:38,993 --> 00:11:40,261
They haven't found it yet.

00:11:40,327 --> 00:11:42,296
Day shift.

00:11:42,363 --> 00:11:43,531
(short laugh)

00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,668
(gurgles)

00:11:47,735 --> 00:11:49,069
(gurgling, sucking)

00:11:49,136 --> 00:11:51,438
Uh-oh. He's got gas.
Phew.

00:11:51,505 --> 00:11:52,540
Yeah, he's going
to be a stinker.

00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:54,008
You want a mask?
No, I'm all right.

00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:56,977
(sloshing)

00:11:59,146 --> 00:12:01,916
(slurping and bubbling)

00:12:01,982 --> 00:12:04,084
What the hell?

00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:05,786
(gurgling)

00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:12,226
Rat!

00:12:15,095 --> 00:12:16,697
(clattering)

00:12:27,174 --> 00:12:28,309
Nice work.

00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,611
At least I tried to get him.
Where were you?

00:12:30,678 --> 00:12:31,946
I hate rats.

00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:34,648
(glass shattering,
high-pitched scream)

00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:43,766
Wow. Don't bother
being discerning.

00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,368
BROWN:
Hey, what can I say?

00:12:45,435 --> 00:12:48,171
Erotic athletes are kind of
gratuitous with the hands.

00:12:48,238 --> 00:12:52,275
And lube on latex leaves
excellent ridge detail.

00:12:52,342 --> 00:12:54,544
What's with the, uh,
blast from the past?

00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:56,212
You got new evidence
on the miniatures?

00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,947
Um, just refiling
some stuff.

00:12:58,014 --> 00:12:59,749
Uh, G-on-G action.

00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:02,252
It's not really a big question
as to who did it, is it?

00:13:02,318 --> 00:13:04,687
One ring, six women.

00:13:04,754 --> 00:13:07,991
Ursula Major claims Ursula Minor
was responsible

00:13:08,057 --> 00:13:09,392
for the pile drive.

00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:11,861
Only you, my dear,
will know for sure.

00:13:11,928 --> 00:13:14,531
Have fun.

00:13:19,302 --> 00:13:21,938
Is that condensation?

00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:25,542
Oh, no, it's-it's lube...
I think.

00:13:25,608 --> 00:13:28,278
Yeah, these bikinis are
from the erotic athletes

00:13:28,344 --> 00:13:29,779
at Lolita's bar.

00:13:29,846 --> 00:13:31,915
This woman, Lucy Pavorotti,

00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:33,983
broke her neck
flipping around up there.

00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,953
Well, now she's suing everybody.

00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,488
Okay. I'm on it.

00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:43,760
Nothing?

00:13:44,794 --> 00:13:46,429
What?

00:13:46,496 --> 00:13:47,997
Nothing at all?

00:13:48,064 --> 00:13:50,633
I'm all ready for "Luscious Lucy

00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,635
likey Lolita's lubey."

00:13:52,702 --> 00:13:54,938
Or something.

00:13:55,004 --> 00:13:56,806
Every man is not an end
but a beginning.

00:13:56,873 --> 00:13:59,676
Today I rise above
and step up.

00:13:59,742 --> 00:14:01,110
Have a nice day.

00:14:01,177 --> 00:14:02,979
Good point.

00:14:03,046 --> 00:14:04,714
Hey, I've been meaning
to ask you about something

00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:06,082
you might be interested in.
(cell phone buzzing)

00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:09,118
The Forensic Academy
has their conference in June.

00:14:09,185 --> 00:14:10,920
and I'm going to be speaking
on field work.

00:14:10,987 --> 00:14:12,455
But the thing
about it is, man,

00:14:12,522 --> 00:14:15,825
I'm just no good when it comes
to IR trace technology.

00:14:15,892 --> 00:14:18,761
But now you... you are.
Oh.

00:14:18,828 --> 00:14:22,298
So... what do you think?

00:14:22,365 --> 00:14:24,167
It's in Iowa.

00:14:24,234 --> 00:14:28,705
Which is... as fun as
you want to make it, but...

00:14:28,771 --> 00:14:30,073
So according to this,

00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:31,708
a month after
Penny Garden's murder,

00:14:31,774 --> 00:14:33,576
Grissom investigated
an electrocution

00:14:33,643 --> 00:14:35,545
at the Mannleigh
chicken plant.

00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:38,481
<i>The victim was Raymundo Suarez,</i>
<i>early 30s,</i>

00:14:38,548 --> 00:14:40,383
<i>a nighttime janitor.</i>

00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:45,822
<i>It looked like a possible</i>
<i>industrial accident,</i>

00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:51,327
<i>or maybe even</i>
<i>a workplace homicide.</i>

00:14:51,394 --> 00:14:52,662
<i>Right up until they found</i>

00:14:52,729 --> 00:14:55,098
<i>the perfect half-inch scale</i>
<i>cast metal mini.</i>

00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:16,753
Suspects included the boss,
Ike Mannleigh.

00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:20,089
<i>Raymundo was sleeping</i>
<i>with his wife, Bubbles.</i>

00:15:20,156 --> 00:15:21,391
(woman moaning)

00:15:21,457 --> 00:15:24,093
I can't even do it
with my cat watching.

00:15:25,094 --> 00:15:27,564
Wait. Sex, drugs, rock and roll.

00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,865
Do you think it's a pattern?

00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:30,166
No, 'cause
according to this,

00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:32,268
sex may not have
actually been the issue.

00:15:32,335 --> 00:15:33,937
Yeah, Ike Mannleigh
was exonerated,

00:15:34,003 --> 00:15:36,039
and another coworker,
Ernie Dell,

00:15:36,105 --> 00:15:37,740
he looked good
for all of the murders.

00:15:37,807 --> 00:15:38,975
Yeah, that's right,
he was caught on tape

00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:41,678
in an animal rights PSA
made by Izzy Delancy.

00:15:41,744 --> 00:15:43,279
Yes, he was.

00:15:44,814 --> 00:15:47,150
Look at this.

00:15:49,786 --> 00:15:50,420
Ew.

00:15:50,486 --> 00:15:52,188
Yeah, tell me about it.

00:15:52,255 --> 00:15:54,257
I had to scan this thing
for hours.

00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:55,859
Haven't been able to eat chicken
since.

00:15:55,925 --> 00:15:57,060
Anyway, Ernie Dell

00:15:57,126 --> 00:15:58,528
was really into model trains.

00:15:58,595 --> 00:16:00,964
You know, the way a serial
killer's really into pets.

00:16:24,354 --> 00:16:26,723
JOHNSON:
<i>So when CSIs went to his house,</i>

00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:31,160
<i>they found these molds for all</i>
<i>these creepy little things.</i>

00:16:31,227 --> 00:16:33,129
<i>Some of which matched pieces</i>

00:16:33,196 --> 00:16:35,198
<i>from the Izzy Delancy</i>
<i>miniature.</i>

00:16:52,882 --> 00:16:54,584
Ernie was caught on some

00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:56,286
neighborhood watch
surveillance video

00:16:56,352 --> 00:16:58,188
delivering the mini
to Penny Garden's house.

00:16:58,254 --> 00:16:59,422
This guy can't stay away
from a camera.

00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:00,623
You don't know
how right you are.

00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,125
He confessed on live video,

00:17:02,192 --> 00:17:03,826
e-mailed it directly
to Grissom.

00:17:03,893 --> 00:17:06,930
My name is Ernest Edward Dell.

00:17:06,996 --> 00:17:11,367
I was born in 1946
in Ames, Iowa.

00:17:11,434 --> 00:17:14,337
(tape fast-forwarding)

00:17:14,404 --> 00:17:16,306
...spend any amount of time
around people,

00:17:16,372 --> 00:17:18,541
you get your heart broke.

00:17:18,608 --> 00:17:20,944
Treachery.

00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,312
Hypocrisy.

00:17:22,378 --> 00:17:24,447
The promise of love.

00:17:24,514 --> 00:17:28,251
A man could kill from sunup
to sunset

00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:33,022
and still his work
would never be done.

00:17:35,758 --> 00:17:37,660
(gunshot)
Wendy?

00:17:38,561 --> 00:17:40,430
Could I speak
with you a moment?

00:17:40,496 --> 00:17:41,865
Sure.

00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:50,139
This is exactly why I didn't
invite you to join us.

00:17:50,206 --> 00:17:52,475
You take over everything.
Uh...

00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:54,177
Grissom asked me
to gather some techs

00:17:54,244 --> 00:17:55,311
to review the
Miniature cases.

00:17:55,378 --> 00:17:56,379
Like a think tank.

00:17:56,446 --> 00:17:57,580
Yeah, I know, they told me.

00:17:57,647 --> 00:17:59,782
So, kudos to you.

00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:01,351
I hand selected them with
careful consideration

00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:02,685
to group dynamics.

00:18:02,752 --> 00:18:03,853
Well, I can see that.

00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,355
I mean, it's you
and your back up singers.

00:18:05,421 --> 00:18:06,689
You're Davy Hodges
and the Lemmings.

00:18:06,756 --> 00:18:07,957
You should take your act
on the road.

00:18:08,024 --> 00:18:10,793
ANDREWS:
We can hear you.

00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,795
Look, the only reason
that you don't like me

00:18:12,862 --> 00:18:13,997
is because I actually
stand up to you.

00:18:14,063 --> 00:18:15,899
Which, by the way,
is exactly what you need.

00:18:15,965 --> 00:18:18,401
You know I would be good
at all this miniature stuff.

00:18:18,468 --> 00:18:20,537
That's not the
only reason.

00:18:20,603 --> 00:18:23,573
Really? Okay, what is it?

00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,275
You think
you're too cool.

00:18:25,341 --> 00:18:27,677
Oh, my God.
What are we, 12?

00:18:27,744 --> 00:18:30,280
I don't know, are we?

00:18:30,346 --> 00:18:32,916
I don't know, are we?

00:18:37,854 --> 00:18:39,522
It's just a rat, fellas.

00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:41,558
Why are you wearing
the HazMat gear?

00:18:41,624 --> 00:18:42,859
He made me do it.

00:18:42,926 --> 00:18:45,261
It's a wild animal
covered with potentially

00:18:45,328 --> 00:18:48,031
biohazardous material
with claws.

00:18:48,097 --> 00:18:50,133
Rabies, scabies,
AIDS, hepatitis.

00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,970
I'm thinking of this suit
as a giant rubber glove.

00:18:55,004 --> 00:18:57,574
ROBBINS:
The vic's intestines?

00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,742
What are you doing?

00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:01,878
Rats are neophobic--
they fear the new.

00:19:01,945 --> 00:19:04,781
We stand a better
chance of catching him

00:19:04,848 --> 00:19:07,150
by giving him what
he's used to.

00:19:14,524 --> 00:19:16,793
(scratching)

00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,929
(thumping)

00:19:19,996 --> 00:19:23,833
Pestilence, alive and well.

00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,468
(electrical crackling)

00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,206
(crackling continues,
power whining)

00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:36,312
I think he's onto us, Doc.

00:19:38,982 --> 00:19:41,384
ANDREWS:
<i>Miniature number four</i>
<i>was another home,</i>

00:19:41,451 --> 00:19:43,453
<i>a unit in a high-rise condo,</i>

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,555
<i>complete</i>
<i>with a working fireplace...</i>

00:19:45,622 --> 00:19:46,723
(cat meows)

00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:50,326
<i>...and a dead cat.</i>

00:19:54,931 --> 00:19:57,934
(cutting cardboard)

00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,206
(tape tearing)

00:20:03,273 --> 00:20:06,676
<i>But the MO on this one</i>
<i>was full of anomalies.</i>

00:20:06,743 --> 00:20:08,645
<i>It was sent to the Crime Lab</i>

00:20:08,711 --> 00:20:10,713
<i>shortly after Ernie Dell's</i>
<i>suicide,</i>

00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,551
<i>but before the murder</i>
<i>had actually been committed.</i>

00:20:14,617 --> 00:20:16,152
<i>And the really weird part</i>

00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:20,089
<i>was the package was addressed</i>
<i>directly to Grissom.</i>

00:20:21,457 --> 00:20:23,159
But why, to taunt him?

00:20:23,226 --> 00:20:24,861
Like suddenly
it's personal?

00:20:24,928 --> 00:20:27,997
The intended victim
was Barbara Tallman.

00:20:28,064 --> 00:20:29,232
A therapist.

00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:30,466
But we got there first.

00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:32,535
PD set up a sting
which resulted in the death

00:20:32,602 --> 00:20:35,238
of an undercover officer, while
a roomful of detectives watched.

00:20:35,305 --> 00:20:37,874
Oy.

00:20:37,941 --> 00:20:39,008
Again, the killer
knew the habits

00:20:39,075 --> 00:20:40,510
of the victim.

00:20:40,577 --> 00:20:43,279
This one always took
an afternoon nap.

00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:48,651
<i>Based on her position</i>
<i>on the couch,</i>

00:20:48,718 --> 00:20:51,454
<i>the CSIs thought that</i>
<i>the intended cause of death</i>

00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:54,424
<i>might be suffocation</i>
<i>or poisoning.</i>

00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,927
<i>But they found something else</i>
<i>instead.</i>

00:21:05,101 --> 00:21:07,670
ANDREWS:
<i>Yeah, here,</i>
<i>it looks like the killer put</i>

00:21:07,737 --> 00:21:09,405
<i>some kind of gizmo on the flue.</i>

00:21:09,472 --> 00:21:11,774
<i>See, the timer went off,</i>
<i>activated a motor</i>

00:21:11,841 --> 00:21:13,743
<i>which sealed the flap</i>
<i>and dropped powdered charcoal</i>

00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,679
<i>onto the fire,</i>
<i>producing carbon monoxide.</i>

00:21:16,746 --> 00:21:18,882
<i>So the fumes had nowhere to go</i>
<i>but out into the apartment</i>

00:21:18,948 --> 00:21:22,785
<i>and into</i>
<i>the undercover officer.</i>

00:21:24,621 --> 00:21:25,288
(knocking on glass)

00:21:25,355 --> 00:21:26,523
Later, Betties.

00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:28,725
Quitter.
Glory whore.

00:21:30,593 --> 00:21:31,961
Who were the suspects?

00:21:32,028 --> 00:21:34,097
Somebody directly
connected with Ernie.

00:21:34,163 --> 00:21:36,432
Somebody worth
killing himself for.

00:21:36,499 --> 00:21:39,302
Maybe his son Lionel.

00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:42,138
Looks like Lionel Dell
knew Barbara Tallman.

00:21:42,205 --> 00:21:45,108
LIONEL:
Okay, so maybe
I met her, so what?

00:21:45,175 --> 00:21:46,576
CURTIS:
So, she's dead.

00:21:46,643 --> 00:21:50,547
That's four stiffs
associated with you, Lionel.

00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:55,051
Five, if you count Ernie.

00:21:55,118 --> 00:21:56,286
I don't.

00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,188
You know, you keep saying
that you hated your dad,

00:21:58,254 --> 00:21:59,455
but I'm not buying it.

00:21:59,522 --> 00:22:01,157
You go through your life alone,

00:22:01,224 --> 00:22:03,893
you're good
with your hands,

00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,362
you have weird hobbies,
you make little things.

00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:07,463
And when that
gets tricky...

00:22:09,499 --> 00:22:10,633
...you call your father.

00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,370
Let me tell you about Ernie.

00:22:14,437 --> 00:22:18,308
What he cared about
in his life was...

00:22:18,374 --> 00:22:22,111
his wife, his trains,

00:22:22,178 --> 00:22:23,246
and his kids,

00:22:23,313 --> 00:22:25,114
in that order.

00:22:25,181 --> 00:22:26,482
Kids?

00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:27,917
You're an only child.

00:22:27,984 --> 00:22:28,918
(chuckles)

00:22:28,985 --> 00:22:31,754
Again, if only.

00:22:31,821 --> 00:22:33,556
If you're looking
for a love connection,

00:22:33,623 --> 00:22:34,591
then you should maybe

00:22:34,657 --> 00:22:36,826
go talk to one of
the chosen ones.

00:22:36,893 --> 00:22:38,328
What are you talking about?

00:22:38,394 --> 00:22:40,330
Fosters.

00:22:40,396 --> 00:22:44,167
<i>My parents had, like, dozens.</i>

00:22:44,234 --> 00:22:47,904
<i>They'd come and go,</i>
<i>some before I was born.</i>

00:22:47,971 --> 00:22:50,240
<i>My mom loved kids.</i>

00:22:50,306 --> 00:22:52,976
<i>Dad loved Mom.</i>

00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:55,311
<i>I guess, as soon as</i>
<i>I came around,</i>

00:22:55,378 --> 00:22:57,380
<i>the love ran out.</i>

00:22:59,582 --> 00:23:02,151
I had a friend
who tried to reconnect

00:23:02,218 --> 00:23:04,053
with some of her old
foster siblings.

00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,288
And honestly, it's
next to impossible.

00:23:05,355 --> 00:23:06,356
The system
protects minors,

00:23:06,422 --> 00:23:07,457
they change their names,

00:23:07,524 --> 00:23:10,293
and some of them just
fall right off the map.

00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,328
Well, the only
link we have

00:23:12,395 --> 00:23:14,197
is a disposable
cell phone number.

00:23:14,264 --> 00:23:15,164
Calls made to
all four victims?

00:23:15,231 --> 00:23:16,266
Mm-hmm.

00:23:16,332 --> 00:23:18,034
And additional minutes
purchased on the phone

00:23:18,101 --> 00:23:19,836
with Ernie Dell's credit card
after his death.

00:23:19,903 --> 00:23:21,371
Yeah, online billing.

00:23:21,437 --> 00:23:24,174
You can just keep spending and
paying until the card expires.

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,909
So what happened when
they called the number?

00:23:25,975 --> 00:23:29,579
They did call the
number, right?

00:23:31,581 --> 00:23:33,283
I'm sure they did.

00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:43,393
(dialing)

00:23:43,459 --> 00:23:44,394
What are you doing?

00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,796
Shh.

00:23:46,863 --> 00:23:47,931
(line ringing)

00:23:53,436 --> 00:23:54,637
(beep)

00:23:54,704 --> 00:23:56,039
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
Leave a message after the tone.

00:23:56,105 --> 00:23:58,308
(beep)

00:24:02,478 --> 00:24:03,546
Nice one, Simms.

00:24:05,415 --> 00:24:07,417
Now they have
my cell phone number.

00:24:13,415 --> 00:24:15,184
Well, the victims
don't have much in common,

00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,519
so I say we go metaphoric.

00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:18,887
Hypocrisy.

00:24:18,954 --> 00:24:20,022
Yeah, I get it.

00:24:20,088 --> 00:24:22,191
There's Izzy the vegan
eating bacon;

00:24:22,257 --> 00:24:24,426
Penny, the cigarette smoking
cancer patient;

00:24:24,493 --> 00:24:26,962
Raymundo, the church-going
adulterer;

00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:28,997
and Barbara,
the overmedicated shrink.

00:24:29,064 --> 00:24:31,233
This is the United States
of America.

00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,469
Hypocrisy is the new
national anthem.

00:24:33,535 --> 00:24:34,703
Forget it.

00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:35,671
Stretching.

00:24:35,737 --> 00:24:37,039
Grissom said they checked

00:24:37,106 --> 00:24:39,241
for commonalities between
victims and got nowhere.

00:24:39,308 --> 00:24:41,844
I was reading
an article

00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,646
in the JFS
about literary forensics.

00:24:44,713 --> 00:24:49,084
They use a computer program
to analyze documents

00:24:49,151 --> 00:24:51,253
to determine authorship.

00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,688
For instance,
when the book <i>Primary Colors</i>

00:24:52,754 --> 00:24:54,623
was first published anonymously,
people knew it was

00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,924
one of Clinton's speech writers,

00:24:55,991 --> 00:24:59,595
so they compared word usage
and phrasing with the writers

00:24:59,661 --> 00:25:03,232
on his staff and discovered
who'd probably written it.

00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:05,534
I say we look at the work
to find the author.

00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:07,936
Try to figure out who it is

00:25:08,003 --> 00:25:10,005
by what message
they're trying to send.

00:25:13,742 --> 00:25:15,010
What?

00:25:15,077 --> 00:25:17,246
That was a very good idea.

00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,814
Well, I have one occasionally.

00:25:22,851 --> 00:25:24,319
Okay.

00:25:24,386 --> 00:25:27,256
Look, clearly the killer
is into signatures, right?

00:25:27,322 --> 00:25:28,690
I mean, the miniatures
themselves are signatures,

00:25:28,757 --> 00:25:32,528
and then within each miniature,
they all have

00:25:32,594 --> 00:25:33,429
this doll thing.

00:25:33,495 --> 00:25:34,696
That creepy little Sally.

00:25:34,763 --> 00:25:36,365
Well, we're working
under the assumption

00:25:36,432 --> 00:25:38,634
that the killer was
a foster kid, right?

00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,135
With probably
an abusive childhood.

00:25:40,202 --> 00:25:41,370
So a bloody baby doll?

00:25:41,437 --> 00:25:43,338
I mean, it's really not
that much of a stretch

00:25:43,405 --> 00:25:44,940
to say that the doll
represents the killer.

00:25:45,007 --> 00:25:47,876
Grissom had something on that.

00:25:47,943 --> 00:25:49,445
"Freud's Theory of the Uncanny

00:25:49,511 --> 00:25:51,046
"raises the point
that as children,

00:25:51,113 --> 00:25:52,681
"we want the doll
to come to life,

00:25:52,748 --> 00:25:54,950
"but as adults, we are
terrified by the idea.

00:25:55,017 --> 00:25:57,719
"Doll could represent the
uncanny that is feared,

00:25:57,786 --> 00:25:59,922
the Sandman."

00:25:59,988 --> 00:26:02,491
Right. Or exactly
what I just said.

00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:05,094
So, we're looking
for an obsessive,

00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,330
meticulous,
dark-ass misanthrope

00:26:08,397 --> 00:26:11,300
who seeks recognition
for his efforts.

00:26:18,173 --> 00:26:19,708
When would I find the time?

00:26:19,775 --> 00:26:21,076
I'm always here.

00:26:21,143 --> 00:26:22,444
(chuckles)

00:26:22,511 --> 00:26:24,146
Can I have a chip?
No.

00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,849
Here.

00:26:26,915 --> 00:26:27,850
Thank you.

00:26:27,916 --> 00:26:29,351
You're welcome.

00:26:31,086 --> 00:26:33,689
All the miniatures have food.

00:26:33,755 --> 00:26:35,991
<i>Eggs...</i>

00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:38,494
<i>booze...</i>

00:26:40,362 --> 00:26:43,699
<i>Tea and cookies...</i>

00:26:43,766 --> 00:26:46,201
<i>And a chicken?</i>

00:26:46,268 --> 00:26:49,872
But is it considered food if
it's still alive and clucking?

00:26:49,938 --> 00:26:52,307
You've never lived
in Pennsylvania.

00:26:52,374 --> 00:26:54,176
I think if the killer
is trying to make

00:26:54,243 --> 00:26:55,410
some sort of
anti-food statement,

00:26:55,477 --> 00:26:57,312
there are much better places
in Vegas to do it.

00:26:57,379 --> 00:26:58,814
Like blowing up a buffet.

00:26:58,881 --> 00:27:00,549
Yeah. Gluttons
eating crab legs.

00:27:00,616 --> 00:27:01,717
That's exactly
where I'd start.

00:27:01,784 --> 00:27:02,785
(chuckles)

00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:04,520
(cell phone ringing)

00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:08,657
Did you guys see <i>Scream?</i>

00:27:08,724 --> 00:27:10,259
(cell phone continues ringing)

00:27:15,964 --> 00:27:17,900
(beep)

00:27:17,966 --> 00:27:19,334
Hello?

00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,039
Oh, hi, Catherine.

00:27:24,106 --> 00:27:25,507
Have I seen Wendy?

00:27:25,574 --> 00:27:26,975
Uh, no.

00:27:27,042 --> 00:27:29,244
She hasn't been at
her desk all day long.
Give me...

00:27:29,311 --> 00:27:30,479
Here, let me
look for her.

00:27:30,546 --> 00:27:31,713
Oh, oh, wait,
here she is.

00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,182
(whispers):
Loser.

00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,316
Hey, Catherine,
what's up?

00:27:34,383 --> 00:27:35,551
Hey, you said you were gonna

00:27:35,617 --> 00:27:37,519
rush DNA off that Taser
that I checked in.

00:27:37,586 --> 00:27:38,587
Yeah, I did.

00:27:38,654 --> 00:27:40,823
And the blood on
the Taser tips did match

00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:42,758
your heart attack victim,
but I also found

00:27:42,825 --> 00:27:43,992
a second male contributor

00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:45,561
who's probably your suspect.

00:27:45,627 --> 00:27:48,597
Run the unknown against
the semen that I found

00:27:48,664 --> 00:27:49,698
on the clown wig

00:27:49,765 --> 00:27:51,433
from my Peeping Tom case
last month.

00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,035
Um, sure. Why?

00:27:53,102 --> 00:27:56,605
Let's just say I got a real
good hunch about this one.

00:27:56,672 --> 00:27:58,540
Who's the big
clown now, huh?

00:28:05,714 --> 00:28:07,549
What about music?

00:28:07,616 --> 00:28:09,685
Izzy has gold records,

00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:11,720
Penny had a record player,

00:28:11,787 --> 00:28:13,956
Barbara had high-end
stereo equipment.

00:28:14,022 --> 00:28:15,390
Yeah, but what about
the chicken plant?

00:28:15,457 --> 00:28:17,292
The squeals of dying chickens?

00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:19,027
No go, <i>amigo.</i>

00:28:19,094 --> 00:28:20,295
What about flowers?

00:28:20,362 --> 00:28:22,531
The flower delivery guy
might have access to the space.

00:28:22,598 --> 00:28:25,601
Well, I see flowers
in Penny's and Barbara's,

00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:27,202
but not Izzy's.

00:28:30,305 --> 00:28:31,740
Flour canister?

00:28:31,807 --> 00:28:32,975
Stop that.

00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:34,042
Besides, I don't think
the slaughterhouse

00:28:34,109 --> 00:28:36,945
would be into the lobby bouquet.

00:28:37,012 --> 00:28:38,547
What about mail?

00:28:38,614 --> 00:28:39,715
A crazed postal worker.

00:28:39,782 --> 00:28:40,983
Wouldn't be the first time.

00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:43,152
There's mail on the counter,
mail on the floors,

00:28:43,218 --> 00:28:45,754
mail on the desk...

00:28:45,821 --> 00:28:47,389
No mail in the henhouse.

00:28:47,456 --> 00:28:50,526
Maybe they have puns in common.

00:28:50,592 --> 00:28:51,760
Look, if this
is really about

00:28:51,827 --> 00:28:52,995
the killer trying
to reveal something,

00:28:53,061 --> 00:28:55,864
is there anything that's
gotten more in-your-face

00:28:55,931 --> 00:28:56,932
with each successive miniature?

00:28:56,999 --> 00:28:59,234
Well, the way he kills

00:28:59,301 --> 00:29:01,003
has certainly gotten
more complicated.

00:29:01,069 --> 00:29:04,273
Blunt force trauma
to poison to electrocution

00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:07,643
to a timed booby trap of carbon
monoxide in the fireplace.

00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:08,844
What about newspaper?

00:29:08,911 --> 00:29:12,681
Starts out on the counter,
then all over the floor,

00:29:12,748 --> 00:29:14,516
then with the doll,
as the headline.

00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:15,884
That's bolder
and bolder.

00:29:15,951 --> 00:29:18,587
See, again, there's no newspaper
in the chicken plant,

00:29:18,654 --> 00:29:19,822
not even shredded in the cages.

00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:20,856
Okay, buzz kill.

00:29:20,923 --> 00:29:22,091
You come up with a theory.

00:29:22,157 --> 00:29:24,526
Hey, it's not me,
it's the Chicken plant.

00:29:24,593 --> 00:29:26,261
That's the streak-breaker.

00:29:26,328 --> 00:29:28,130
Well, then, maybe we should
start with that one

00:29:28,197 --> 00:29:29,231
and work our way out.

00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,111
Can you smell that?

00:29:42,177 --> 00:29:43,479
Yes.

00:29:43,545 --> 00:29:45,948
You shouldn't be able
to smell that through your suit.

00:29:46,014 --> 00:29:47,850
Good to know.

00:29:49,885 --> 00:29:51,687
(groans softly)

00:29:55,691 --> 00:29:59,528
Did you know that rodents have
skeletons with flexible joints?

00:29:59,595 --> 00:30:01,230
No.

00:30:01,296 --> 00:30:03,165
If they can get their head
through something,

00:30:03,232 --> 00:30:06,135
the rest of their body
can contort to fit.

00:30:06,201 --> 00:30:10,272
They can crawl into spaces
as small as a quarter.

00:30:11,306 --> 00:30:13,642
Lousy varmints.

00:30:13,709 --> 00:30:16,678
(Robbins chuckles)

00:30:16,745 --> 00:30:18,580
Bastard hit the main line.

00:30:23,051 --> 00:30:25,921
That's not the only thing
he's got in his mouth.

00:30:44,673 --> 00:30:46,809
What do you
think, Doc?

00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:49,545
My guess would be
black tar heroin.

00:30:49,611 --> 00:30:51,747
Looks like the rat ate the mule.

00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:11,633
Okay, look, we gave it a try.

00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,068
There's nothing in this thing
but machinery.

00:31:13,135 --> 00:31:15,471
Let's just put it back.

00:31:15,537 --> 00:31:16,972
Chill out.

00:31:25,814 --> 00:31:26,982
What's this?

00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,398
SIMMS:
You freaking broke it!

00:31:43,465 --> 00:31:44,967
That's destroying
evidence.

00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:46,201
I can fix it.

00:31:47,536 --> 00:31:49,738
Have any of you guys

00:31:49,805 --> 00:31:51,006
seen Grissom?

00:31:53,008 --> 00:31:55,744
HODGES:
Some garlic bread?

00:31:55,811 --> 00:31:57,079
Nice Chianti, maybe?

00:31:57,146 --> 00:31:58,280
Kiss my ass.

00:31:58,347 --> 00:32:00,115
I'd like to see you
crawl around in a Dumpster

00:32:00,182 --> 00:32:02,885
determining the difference
between blood and marinara sauce

00:32:02,951 --> 00:32:04,753
with six mobster goons
giving you the stink eye.

00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,221
Wouldn't know
anything about that.

00:32:06,288 --> 00:32:07,856
We're holed up in a lab all day.

00:32:07,923 --> 00:32:09,792
What are
you guys doing?

00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:12,995
You know, forget it.

00:32:13,061 --> 00:32:14,797
I don't even care.

00:32:14,863 --> 00:32:16,131
I need to go
take a shower.

00:32:16,198 --> 00:32:17,933
Would one of you please
call janitorial

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,802
and have them clean my Denali?

00:32:19,868 --> 00:32:20,669
Sure.

00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,837
Oh, and, uh,

00:32:21,904 --> 00:32:24,673
we think the killer might
have threw up in the alley.

00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,275
Full panel.

00:32:26,341 --> 00:32:27,910
Enjoy.

00:32:28,911 --> 00:32:31,013
Got to go.

00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:31,914
Good luck.

00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:42,591
"NaOCl."

00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:46,328
Bleach.

00:32:46,395 --> 00:32:49,665
There was bleach
at the Izzy Delancy scene.

00:32:52,935 --> 00:32:55,804
HODGES:
<i>And in the vase water</i>
<i>at Barbara Tillman's condo.</i>

00:32:55,871 --> 00:32:58,740
SIMMS:
<i>Why?</i>

00:32:58,807 --> 00:33:01,043
HODGES:
<i>Put a few drop in the water,</i>
<i>helps kill bacteria</i>

00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,478
<i>keeps the flowers blooming</i>
<i>a long time.</i>

00:33:02,544 --> 00:33:07,649
<i>Put too much bleach,</i>
<i>flowers die.</i>

00:33:07,716 --> 00:33:09,384
What about Penny?

00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,721
Okay.

00:33:12,788 --> 00:33:14,022
You stay here.

00:33:14,089 --> 00:33:16,558
I'm going to switch this
out for the Penny Garden.

00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:18,393
No, you know what? No.

00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,662
Look, this entire thing

00:33:20,729 --> 00:33:22,364
has turned into a three-ring
circus, 'cause every time

00:33:22,431 --> 00:33:23,899
we get something,
something else just comes along

00:33:23,966 --> 00:33:25,334
and proves us wrong.

00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,070
And, honestly, I think
you've lost your damn mind.

00:33:28,137 --> 00:33:29,938
I mean, what makes
you think if the CSIs

00:33:30,005 --> 00:33:31,273
can't solve this, that we can?

00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,042
Seriously. I'm a
little tired of your
delusions of grandeur.

00:33:34,109 --> 00:33:37,412
And I'm way behind in work,
and I'm sick of sneaking around.

00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:39,448
So that's it.

00:33:39,515 --> 00:33:41,917
I'm out.

00:33:56,373 --> 00:33:59,710
(devices beeping)

00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,688
Hey.

00:34:10,754 --> 00:34:12,456
Hey.

00:34:12,523 --> 00:34:13,691
Here you go.

00:34:13,757 --> 00:34:14,959
I checked
under the keys.

00:34:15,025 --> 00:34:17,928
Crusty white stains,
pale blue under ALS.

00:34:17,995 --> 00:34:19,196
Semen, huh?

00:34:19,263 --> 00:34:21,031
What made you check
under the keys?

00:34:21,098 --> 00:34:23,901
A buttprint
on the credenza.

00:34:24,935 --> 00:34:26,804
Yeah, okay, that's gross.

00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:29,573
CDC contacted us,
because the whole office

00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,041
has a herpes
simplex 1 outbreak,

00:34:31,108 --> 00:34:32,876
and nobody could
figure out why.

00:34:32,943 --> 00:34:35,412
I guess you never
really know what's
going on in your office.

00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:38,882
Hey, Sara?

00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:40,784
Is it true

00:34:40,851 --> 00:34:42,686
that the Miniature cases

00:34:42,753 --> 00:34:44,154
have been keeping Grissom
up at night?

00:34:44,221 --> 00:34:46,090
How would I know?

00:34:46,156 --> 00:34:48,559
I just thought that maybe
you guys all talk about this it,

00:34:48,626 --> 00:34:52,730
and... Hodges told me that
Grissom confided in him

00:34:52,796 --> 00:34:54,732
and...

00:34:54,798 --> 00:34:55,966
You know what? Never mind.

00:34:56,033 --> 00:34:57,167
Just forget I even asked.

00:34:57,234 --> 00:34:58,836
Well, listen, I-I
don't know what Hodges

00:34:58,903 --> 00:35:01,805
has been telling you, but...

00:35:01,872 --> 00:35:05,442
do you really think that Grissom
would confide in him?

00:35:05,509 --> 00:35:06,944
About anything?

00:35:07,011 --> 00:35:08,379
No.

00:35:08,445 --> 00:35:10,014
Of course not.

00:35:13,584 --> 00:35:16,086
You are a liar and an ass.

00:35:16,153 --> 00:35:18,255
I mean, if you want
to go running around
like Sir Galahad,

00:35:18,322 --> 00:35:19,523
just yanking swords
willy-nilly,

00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,925
that is totally
your business.

00:35:20,991 --> 00:35:23,594
But you put all of
us at risk here.

00:35:25,129 --> 00:35:27,298
I think we might be onto
something with the bleach.

00:35:27,364 --> 00:35:28,599
Hey! Stop!

00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:30,734
Archie and Henry
gave up a full day's work

00:35:30,801 --> 00:35:32,870
thinking that they were doing
something to help Grissom.

00:35:32,937 --> 00:35:35,005
And Grissom never even asked you
to do this in the first place.

00:35:35,072 --> 00:35:36,707
Technically,
all I said to them

00:35:36,774 --> 00:35:38,609
was that Grissom needed
our help, which is true.

00:35:38,676 --> 00:35:40,611
I only lied to you.

00:35:40,678 --> 00:35:42,379
Aren't you worried
about your own caseload?

00:35:42,446 --> 00:35:44,615
I've trained them all to
believe that the laser ablater

00:35:44,682 --> 00:35:47,551
and mass spec take twice
as long as they actually do.

00:35:47,618 --> 00:35:49,153
Oh, my God.

00:35:49,219 --> 00:35:50,387
I cannot believe you.

00:35:50,454 --> 00:35:51,689
I can't believe that,

00:35:51,755 --> 00:35:54,058
for half a second, I actually
thought that I might...

00:35:54,124 --> 00:35:55,159
You what?

00:35:55,225 --> 00:35:56,160
Nothing.

00:35:56,226 --> 00:35:59,296
What on God's green earth
possessed you to do this?

He's a drug runner

According to sources,
he was skimming,

00:38:10,928 --> 00:38:13,364
swallowing a couple balloons
for personal use.

00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,232

Bleach.

00:39:36,247 --> 00:39:37,281
What?

00:39:38,315 --> 00:39:41,552
I found a common element
in all four miniatures...

00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:43,554
bleach.

00:39:43,621 --> 00:39:45,522
There's a bottle of it
in the trash at Izzy's;

00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:48,158
there's a barrel of it
at the chicken plant,

00:39:48,225 --> 00:39:51,161
There's, uh, bleach in the
flower water at Barbara's condo,

00:39:51,228 --> 00:39:52,897
and now...

00:39:52,963 --> 00:39:56,300
a bleach coupon
in Penny's.

00:39:56,367 --> 00:39:58,035
This-this may sound crazy,

00:39:58,102 --> 00:39:59,637
but if the killer
is a housekeeper

00:39:59,703 --> 00:40:02,273
or a janitor, they
would certainly know
the ins and outs

00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:04,975
of each location, uh,

00:40:05,042 --> 00:40:07,211
what goes in what drawer,
what book on what bookshelf.

00:40:07,278 --> 00:40:09,213
Hours of operation,
habits, schedules.

00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,548
I've thought a lot about
the killer's pathology,

00:40:11,615 --> 00:40:13,751
and there doesn't
seem to be any regular

00:40:13,817 --> 00:40:15,185
interval between murders,

00:40:15,252 --> 00:40:17,888
which makes me think that
they're triggered by something.

00:40:17,955 --> 00:40:23,127
Maybe... maybe the killer
is triggered by bleach.

00:40:28,399 --> 00:40:30,200
The bellows.

00:40:31,235 --> 00:40:32,870

James Tilly Matthews.

00:40:34,905 --> 00:40:36,840
Early 19th century London.

00:40:36,907 --> 00:40:39,910
Matthews was in Bedlam Hospital
awaiting trial.

00:40:39,977 --> 00:40:42,613
Doctors were trying to determine
his sanity.

00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,014
Several interviewed him.

00:40:44,081 --> 00:40:47,217
Half thought he was sane,
half insane.

00:40:47,284 --> 00:40:49,820
Turns out he
was perfectly normal...

00:40:49,887 --> 00:40:53,090
except when someone
mentioned politics.

00:40:53,157 --> 00:40:55,793
At that point,
he'd go into a rage

00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:57,027
about the little men

00:40:57,094 --> 00:40:59,296
who lived underground
and used a bellows

00:40:59,363 --> 00:41:01,232
to push thoughts into his mind,

00:41:01,298 --> 00:41:04,868
as well as the minds
of Parliament and the Queen.

00:41:04,935 --> 00:41:08,339
A specific object
or word

00:41:08,405 --> 00:41:12,009
that triggers the urge to kill.

00:41:12,076 --> 00:41:14,612
That's a form
of delusional psychosis.

00:41:14,678 --> 00:41:17,314
Rare, but does exist.

00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:18,849
If the killer is

00:41:18,916 --> 00:41:20,718
one of Ernie Dell's foster kids,

00:41:20,784 --> 00:41:24,989
maybe bleach played a role
in some sort of childhood abuse.

00:41:25,055 --> 00:41:27,825
He's getting back at the world
for what they did to him.

00:41:27,891 --> 00:41:29,827
Well, if having bleach
in your home

00:41:29,893 --> 00:41:31,729
is the common element
among victims...

00:41:31,795 --> 00:41:33,264
(chuckles)

00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:35,366
...then anyone can be next.

00:41:35,432 --> 00:41:37,167
Did the victims use

00:41:37,234 --> 00:41:38,903
a common cleaning service?

00:41:38,969 --> 00:41:42,106
Not that we know of.

00:41:42,172 --> 00:41:44,208
However,

00:41:44,275 --> 00:41:47,311
it's not unusual for people
with these pathologies

00:41:47,378 --> 00:41:49,914
to become vocal
toward the institutions

00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,716
that they feel
propagate the trigger.

00:41:52,783 --> 00:41:55,552
Maybe we could call
bleach manufacturing companies

00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:58,022
and see if they've received
any hate mail.

00:41:58,088 --> 00:42:01,258
Cross reference correspondence
with Vegas postmarks.

00:42:01,325 --> 00:42:04,061
Might be able
to narrow down neighborhoods.

00:42:07,298 --> 00:42:08,799
Good job, Hodges.

00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:11,902
Really.

00:42:11,969 --> 00:42:14,238
(sighs)

00:42:14,305 --> 00:42:15,773
Now...

00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,908
Do you mind?

00:42:19,944 --> 00:42:21,545
Absolutely...

00:42:21,612 --> 00:42:24,048
(objects rattling)

00:42:27,017 --> 00:42:30,054
I... I'm sorry

00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,288
if I crossed the line.

00:42:31,355 --> 00:42:32,790
It won't happen again.
