00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,969
(sobbing):
You got the wrong guy, man!

00:00:03,035 --> 00:00:03,970
I didn't do it.

00:00:04,036 --> 00:00:06,072
I didn't do it, man.

00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:08,407
(gunshot)

00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:34,267
(distorted, dream-like):
I love you, Mikey.

00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,709
(amplified heartbeat)

00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:52,618
(heartbeat fades)

00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:16,509
That is what I love
about this town.

00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,744
They've got good eggs Benedict
24 hours a day.

00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:20,446
Just getting off shift?
No, I'm going in early.

00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:23,683
Thank you.

00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:26,218
Do you ever eat dinner?

00:01:26,285 --> 00:01:28,421
You're looking at it.

00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:30,856
Okay, I'll see
you at the lab.

00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:32,358
Bye.

00:01:35,394 --> 00:01:36,562
Can I get a check please?

00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:39,498
That guy over there
already paid and tipped.

00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:41,434
Says he's your friend.

00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,480
How's it going, Mike?

00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:56,282
What are you doing here, Frank?

00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,818
What do you want me to do?

00:01:58,884 --> 00:02:00,419
You don't return my calls.

00:02:00,486 --> 00:02:04,323
I tried calling you,
but I've been, uh... busy.

00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,693
You didn't make it
to Amy's memorial Mass.

00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,761
Yeah, I know.

00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:12,198
I got the card
from Father Anthony.

00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,833
Couldn't get away this year.

00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:15,434
It's okay.

00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:18,604
Dennis Graves and I decided
to come to Vegas for a few days,

00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,840
blow off some steam.

00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,842
You like standing? Sit down.

00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,310
I can't.

00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:25,878
Look, Frank, I got to run.

00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,546
We'll get dinner later in the
week, all right? I'll call you.

00:02:27,613 --> 00:02:30,149
Mike.

00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:33,686
Listen, I, uh...
I'm in a bit

00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:36,355
of a fix; I need
you to do me a favor.

00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,624
I can't do it this time. Okay?

00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,059
Don't ask me
to do it, Frank.

00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,662
Things are just starting to...

00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:44,063
Hey.

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,299
What are you getting
so excited about?

00:02:46,365 --> 00:02:47,934
(chuckling):
I didn't say anything.

00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,538
I'm just getting the lay
of the land here, you know?

00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,340
Trying to move on.

00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,343
I got it, bad timing.

00:02:58,377 --> 00:03:00,313
You all right?

00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:02,315
Don't you worry about it.

00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:04,216
I'll sort it out.

00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,564
Looks like it's
you and me again, Hoss.

00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:19,865
You got a problem
with that?

00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:21,000
No, no, I like your style.

00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,501
It's just the whole
suit thing

00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:23,803
you got to work on
a little bit.

00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:26,038
Yeah, yeah,
what do we got?

00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:27,540
Two gunshot victims.

00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:31,110
Male, shot two times
in the chest.

00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:36,382
Female shot in the back,
and her hand is missing.

00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,884
Why take just
one hand?

00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:40,920
KEPPLER:
Maybe there was
something on it he wanted.

00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,296
Boxer shorts, socks.

00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,897
I'm guessing this is his.

00:03:51,964 --> 00:03:53,065
You see another
suitcase?

00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:56,402
No, no, I did not.

00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,907
Looks like she
was just visiting.

00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,110
.45 automatic.

00:04:04,176 --> 00:04:06,145
No purse...

00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:09,115
no valuables.

00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:10,950
Did you see a safe?

00:04:11,984 --> 00:04:14,186
No.

00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,662
No, no safe in here.

00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:24,797
Looks like a robbery.

00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:27,300
Hey, this guy has
a bunch of law enforcement

00:04:27,366 --> 00:04:28,935
logo shirts

00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:30,970
hanging up in here.

00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,705
Check the Bible drawer.

00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,126
Anything?

00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:59,732
Nine millimeter service pistol?

00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,500
Stamped "T.P.D."

00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,003
Could be any city
starting with T.

00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,771
I didn't find any nine
millimeter casing,

00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,374
so this weapon was never fired.

00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,343
The room is registered
to a Dennis Graves

00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:11,544
Trenton, New Jersey.

00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,479
He's a cop, Trenton, PD.

00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,114
Hey, you're from Trenton.
Do you know him?

00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,782
No.

00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,351
Who found them?

00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:24,118
His buddy, Frank McCarty.

BRASS:
So what were you
two guys doing in Vegas?

00:06:01,609 --> 00:06:04,979
Playing a little golf,
indulging in the buffets.

00:06:05,046 --> 00:06:08,182
BRASS:
Is that all you indulged in?

00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:10,084
We were down in the bar,
Dennis picked up a date.

00:06:10,151 --> 00:06:11,252
Is she the date?

00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:13,287
I didn't get a name.

00:06:13,354 --> 00:06:15,122
Anyway, they went upstairs,
I played a little blackjack.

00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:17,491
Then what?
Then, I pulled
some strings

00:06:17,558 --> 00:06:19,493
and got us a tee time
at the Wynn.

00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,095
Dennis didn't answer his phone.

00:06:21,162 --> 00:06:24,265
I figured he was busy
going around the world.

00:06:24,332 --> 00:06:26,133
After a while, I...

00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,635
I knew something was wrong.

00:06:27,702 --> 00:06:29,470
I got hotel security
to open the door.

00:06:29,537 --> 00:06:31,005
Excuse me. Yeah?

00:06:31,072 --> 00:06:33,674
Captain, we got press
all over the place.

00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,476
Can you stick around?
I'll be right back.

00:06:35,543 --> 00:06:36,677
Yeah, sure.

00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:39,880
Okay.

00:06:39,947 --> 00:06:42,116
Mr. McCarty?

00:06:42,183 --> 00:06:44,352
If you don't mind.

00:06:48,422 --> 00:06:51,258
You want to tell me what
I'm seeing here, Frank?

00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:52,259
Could be anything.

00:06:52,326 --> 00:06:54,295
Pimp went off on his whore.

00:06:54,362 --> 00:06:56,063
Robbery gone bad.

00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,665
It's a dangerous town.

00:07:01,068 --> 00:07:02,703
Have a seat.

00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,305
Yeah.

00:07:05,473 --> 00:07:07,241
Heard we have a dead
out-of-town cop.

00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:09,643
Yeah, Detective
Dennis Graves.

00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,245
Trenton PD.

00:07:11,312 --> 00:07:12,580
Trenton?
Yeah.

00:07:16,117 --> 00:07:17,918
David, you got the T.O.D.?

00:07:17,985 --> 00:07:19,887
About four hours ago.

00:07:19,954 --> 00:07:22,256
KEPPLER:
Male was shot twice,
both frontal.

00:07:22,323 --> 00:07:24,992
No exits.

00:07:25,059 --> 00:07:28,029
The girl was shot
once in the back.

00:07:28,095 --> 00:07:29,463
Did you find the hand?

00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,432
I'm guessing
the killer's got it,

00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:34,001
along with the rest
of their valuables.

00:07:34,068 --> 00:07:36,804
Hey, Catherine, check this out.

00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:39,507
I've got an uncapped
bottle of mouthwash here.

00:07:41,142 --> 00:07:43,210
Probably come back
to the hooker.
Yeah, but I've got

00:07:43,277 --> 00:07:45,579
something else,
and this is good.

00:07:46,614 --> 00:07:49,083
There are quite a few

00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,752
long, light-colored hairs

00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:53,521
snagged in the soap dish
right there.

00:07:53,587 --> 00:07:55,056
Not a match to either victim.

00:07:55,122 --> 00:07:57,091
Sloppy housekeeping?

00:07:57,158 --> 00:07:59,427
I doubt the maid
would miss this.

00:07:59,493 --> 00:08:01,262
What appear to be
high heel shoe impressions--

00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:02,797
I checked, again,

00:08:02,863 --> 00:08:04,865
no match to the
working girl.

00:08:04,932 --> 00:08:07,201
Bath towels
haven't been used.

00:08:07,268 --> 00:08:09,470
So who was in the tub
with her shoes on?

00:08:09,537 --> 00:08:12,039
Keppler, do
me a favor.

00:08:12,106 --> 00:08:14,608
Go over by the
body, will you?

00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,715
Yeah?

00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:22,483
I can see you; can you see me?

00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,151
Yep.

00:08:24,218 --> 00:08:25,386
What about if I get low?

00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:28,489
Not anymore.

00:08:28,556 --> 00:08:31,726
So either she was
lying in wait...

00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:34,762
Or an eyewitness tried
to hide from a killer.

00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:39,734
Let's pull the elevator
surveillance.

00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,168
Maybe we can find a blonde

00:08:41,235 --> 00:08:43,037
who got off
on this floor.

00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:48,442
Welcome back, Dr. Grissom.

00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:51,479
It's good to be back, Judy.

00:08:51,545 --> 00:08:54,081
There are no words
to describe how glad
I am you're back.

00:08:54,148 --> 00:08:56,450
But I'm sure you'll find some.

00:08:56,517 --> 00:08:57,585
The lab almost
went to hell

00:08:57,652 --> 00:08:59,987
in a handbag while
you were sabbaticalling.

00:09:00,054 --> 00:09:01,656
I'm sure you
talked to Catherine,

00:09:01,722 --> 00:09:03,491
but just in case
you didn't...

00:09:03,557 --> 00:09:05,760
lot of hurt feelings,
so in case you talk to Nick...

00:09:05,826 --> 00:09:08,629
I'd rather hear it
from Catherine, thanks.

00:09:08,696 --> 00:09:12,667
Fair enough, but,
uh, permit me to say

00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:15,136
that the "Seasonal Behaviors of
the Walden Pond Swamp Mosquito"

00:09:15,202 --> 00:09:17,471
was an incredibly
stimulating seminar.

00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:19,473
And you know this how?

00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,642
I took your course online.

00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:23,244
It's free to alumni.

00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,814
Oh, you're Spanky.

00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:28,983
Seven-four-three.

00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,252
I aced the final, didn't I?

00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,726
(computer beeping)

00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,968
Post-mortem tool marks
to the left wrist.

00:09:48,035 --> 00:09:51,672
No vital reactions
from the tissue.

00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:55,376
Cuts are scalloped,
definitely a serrated blade.

00:09:55,443 --> 00:09:57,345
Not a bad job.

00:09:57,411 --> 00:09:59,246
Anything to help us
identify her?

00:09:59,313 --> 00:10:00,848
David printed
the right hand.

00:10:00,915 --> 00:10:02,249
No hits on AFIS.

00:10:02,316 --> 00:10:03,851
Lucky for you,

00:10:03,918 --> 00:10:05,519
like many young ladies
her age,

00:10:05,586 --> 00:10:07,521
she had some surgical work done.

00:10:07,588 --> 00:10:09,757
Feel these.

00:10:09,824 --> 00:10:11,592
What do you think?

00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:13,828
Implants.

00:10:13,894 --> 00:10:16,030
Kind of big
for my taste, really.

00:10:16,097 --> 00:10:17,832
The other end.

00:10:17,898 --> 00:10:19,400
Oh, they're for the butt?

00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:21,669
KEPPLER:
Implants are serialized.

00:10:21,736 --> 00:10:23,771
We can get an ID from those.

00:10:23,838 --> 00:10:26,240
STOKES:
You know, I spent 12 hours
on a court bench last week.

00:10:26,307 --> 00:10:29,110
I could have used
a pair of these bad boys.

00:10:29,176 --> 00:10:30,644
What about C.O.D.?

00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:32,246
ROBBINS:
Single gunshot to the back,

00:10:32,313 --> 00:10:34,882
just to the right
of the spinal column.

00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:38,285
Bullet severed the aorta,
lodged inside the sternum.

00:10:38,352 --> 00:10:39,253
And the cop?

00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,390
I removed these
from Detective Graves.

00:10:42,456 --> 00:10:44,258
Large caliber, too.

00:10:44,325 --> 00:10:46,260
I'll get those
to Ballistics.

00:10:46,327 --> 00:10:48,729
Okay, so I'll run the serials?

00:10:48,796 --> 00:10:51,799
Yeah.

00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:53,901
I am an ass man.

00:10:53,968 --> 00:10:55,503
(chuckles)

00:10:58,539 --> 00:10:59,740
GRISSOM:
Michael Keppler.

00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:02,143
Hi, Gil Grissom.

00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:03,644
How's everybody
been treating you?

00:11:03,711 --> 00:11:06,580
No complaints,
you've got a great team.

00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:08,282
Yeah, thanks.

00:11:08,349 --> 00:11:10,651
Does Ecklie still
have you slotted for days?

00:11:10,718 --> 00:11:12,420
As far as I know.

00:11:12,486 --> 00:11:15,022
I hear you're working the double
homicide at The Olympia.

00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:16,090
What have you got?

00:11:16,157 --> 00:11:18,392
Oh, it's uh, bullets
from Doc Robbins.

00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:20,261
I was going
to run them through IBIS.

00:11:20,328 --> 00:11:22,797
The dead cop was
from your hometown, huh?

00:11:22,863 --> 00:11:25,266
Yeah. Retired.

00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,400
Did you know him?

00:11:26,467 --> 00:11:29,437
You know how many retired cops
there are in Trenton?

00:11:32,006 --> 00:11:33,741
Well, it's great
to finally meet you.

00:11:33,808 --> 00:11:35,910
Same.

00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:45,160
I love you, Mikey.

00:12:09,952 --> 00:12:11,887
Hey.

00:12:11,954 --> 00:12:14,390
Hey.

00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:17,693
I said, "How do you feel
about butt implants?"

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,828
You don't need them?

00:12:19,895 --> 00:12:20,996
Thank you.

00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:23,665
I wasn't really talking
about me, but...

00:12:23,732 --> 00:12:25,034
Oh, right.

00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,568
Sorry.

00:12:27,936 --> 00:12:30,506
You got something
on the dead cop case?

00:12:30,572 --> 00:12:32,674
The blond hair from the tub

00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:34,910
does match the saliva left
in the mouthwash bottle.

00:12:34,977 --> 00:12:36,211
And it's female,

00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:38,847
but not from the dead hooker
with the big back seat.

00:12:38,914 --> 00:12:42,451
Second female in the room
uses mouthwash.

00:12:44,286 --> 00:12:46,021
More than likely
another hooker.

00:12:46,088 --> 00:12:49,425
Looks like we got a witness.

00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,197
Dennis should've lived long
enough to spoil his grandkids.

00:12:55,264 --> 00:12:57,599
He was a good man, good cop.

00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,935
Good enough to spot a
hooker when he saw one?

00:13:00,002 --> 00:13:02,204
You don't have to be a cop
to have that radar.

00:13:02,271 --> 00:13:03,472
So tell me
about Dennis.

00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:04,673
Did he major in French?

00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,408
Maybe liked ménage à trois?

00:13:06,475 --> 00:13:08,644
You know,
two's company,

00:13:08,711 --> 00:13:09,878
three's a party?

00:13:09,945 --> 00:13:11,413
'Cause there was another girl
in the room with him.

00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,915
Really?
Mm-hmm.

00:13:12,981 --> 00:13:15,617
I only saw him leave
with one girl.

00:13:15,684 --> 00:13:16,819
So as far as you know,

00:13:16,885 --> 00:13:18,287
there wasn't a blond
in there with him?

00:13:18,354 --> 00:13:19,521
(chuckling):
Dennis?

00:13:19,588 --> 00:13:21,623
He could barely handle one.

00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,060
Besides, he was a little tight
with the buck.

00:13:25,127 --> 00:13:27,329
MAN:
<i>Hey, Brown.</i>

00:13:27,396 --> 00:13:29,732
I'm looking at the over-
under in the Suns game.

00:13:29,798 --> 00:13:31,133
What do you think?

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,336
I don't bet sports
anymore.

00:13:34,403 --> 00:13:35,704
Not what I hear.

00:13:35,771 --> 00:13:38,507
According to Stokes, you're
at the top of your game.

00:13:38,574 --> 00:13:40,676
Well, why don't you get
your picks from him

00:13:40,743 --> 00:13:43,779
with his fat Texas mouth.

00:13:43,846 --> 00:13:46,048
I'd take the over.

00:13:46,115 --> 00:13:47,783
Hey.

00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,017
Want some help?

00:13:49,084 --> 00:13:50,786
Welcome back.

00:13:50,853 --> 00:13:51,920
What do you got?

00:13:51,987 --> 00:13:53,188
Well, I'm just
following a lead

00:13:53,255 --> 00:13:55,591
off some serialized
butt implants.

00:13:55,657 --> 00:13:56,892
I missed Las Vegas.

00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:57,993
(laughs)

00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,262
What are you doing here?

00:14:00,329 --> 00:14:03,932
I'm avoiding the paperwork and
mail that's piled up on my desk.

00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:06,969
Well... we got a, uh,
dead prostitute's apartment.

00:14:07,036 --> 00:14:09,838
It's obvious that it's
been ransacked and robbed.

00:14:09,905 --> 00:14:11,974
I'm thinking that she was
the target of the double

00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,876
and the cop was collateral.

00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:15,544
Where would you like me
to start?

00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:17,980
You can hit the dinette.

00:14:18,047 --> 00:14:19,448
I haven't taken that yet.

00:14:19,515 --> 00:14:21,216
Unless you're avoiding
her paperwork, too.

00:14:21,283 --> 00:14:24,219
There's a lot of it.

00:14:29,091 --> 00:14:33,362
Well, she was past due
on her electric bill.

00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:37,399
But seems to have paid
her telephone bill on time.

00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:40,069
Telephone. Hooker's lifeline.

00:14:41,403 --> 00:14:45,207
I'm telling you,
whoever hit this place

00:14:45,274 --> 00:14:47,209
left a lot of prints.

00:14:47,276 --> 00:14:49,378
I, uh, heard
there was some friction

00:14:49,445 --> 00:14:51,413
in the lab
while I was gone.

00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,750
You ever hear
of "reverse forensics"?

00:15:06,628 --> 00:15:08,197
(phone rings)

00:15:08,263 --> 00:15:09,565
Keppler.

00:15:09,631 --> 00:15:11,567
MCCARTY:
There was someone else
in that hotel room.

00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:13,736
I know.

00:15:13,802 --> 00:15:15,738
I need a name.

00:15:15,804 --> 00:15:18,640
I don't have one.

00:15:18,707 --> 00:15:20,109
Don't let me down, kid.

00:15:20,175 --> 00:15:22,711
You got to help me here;
I'm counting on you.

00:15:24,747 --> 00:15:27,182
You okay?

00:15:28,283 --> 00:15:30,786
Yeah.

00:15:30,853 --> 00:15:33,455
Well, I tracked down
the plastic surgeon

00:15:33,522 --> 00:15:35,424
that augmented
Courtney Evans' glutes.

00:15:35,491 --> 00:15:38,394
Probably the only implants
ever paid for in cash

00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,362
by, get this...

00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:44,900
her pimp,
a guy named Eric Hong, aka...

00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:46,568
"Precious Ricky," huh?

00:15:46,635 --> 00:15:49,238
Yeah, that's what
my mama calls me.

00:15:49,304 --> 00:15:50,806
Precious "Licky".

00:15:50,873 --> 00:15:51,874
(chuckles)

00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,443
Is she one of yours?

00:15:56,478 --> 00:15:58,514
No, ain't seen her before.

00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,549
You bought her
butt cheek implants.

00:16:00,616 --> 00:16:04,286
Is that something you normally
do for girls you don't know?

00:16:04,353 --> 00:16:05,921
Oh, see, that's
the problem.

00:16:05,988 --> 00:16:07,489
You're showing me
the wrong end.

00:16:07,556 --> 00:16:08,891
Okay.

00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:12,928
So, then she is one
of yours, right?

00:16:12,995 --> 00:16:15,097
Hey, I run an escort service.

00:16:15,164 --> 00:16:16,298
Strictly legal.

00:16:16,365 --> 00:16:18,400
I'm sure it is.

00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:20,803
So what did she do, Precious?

00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:22,771
She make you mad?

00:16:22,838 --> 00:16:23,906
No.

00:16:23,972 --> 00:16:25,307
No, I don't get mad, man.

00:16:25,374 --> 00:16:27,009
I'm blissed out.

00:16:27,076 --> 00:16:28,243
I'm a Buddhist.

00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,112
I let the anger flow
right through me.

00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:34,783
Sentient beings are numberless,
and I vow to save them.

00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,518
I didn't do
nothing to her.

00:16:36,585 --> 00:16:37,820
Nothing?

00:16:37,886 --> 00:16:38,854
Like cut off her hand,

00:16:38,921 --> 00:16:40,422
and you kill the cop
she was with?

00:16:40,489 --> 00:16:42,324
We know Courtney was
with a blond last night.

00:16:42,391 --> 00:16:43,959
Long hair.

00:16:44,026 --> 00:16:46,328
You got anyone who matches
that description?

00:16:46,395 --> 00:16:48,397
Jenny, Coco, Lani...

00:16:48,464 --> 00:16:50,566
April, May and June, too.

00:16:50,632 --> 00:16:52,067
But you know what?

00:16:52,134 --> 00:16:53,502
The cuffs don't always

00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:55,738
match the collars, you
know what I... (grunts)

00:16:55,804 --> 00:16:57,940
Now, look, Ricky,
maybe you're

00:16:58,006 --> 00:16:59,408
a nice guy, maybe you're not,

00:16:59,475 --> 00:17:01,076
but right now I
really don't care,

00:17:01,143 --> 00:17:03,078
because I think
you're lying to me.

00:17:03,145 --> 00:17:06,081
And that could go very badly
for you.

00:17:06,148 --> 00:17:08,016
(gasps)

00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,651
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

00:17:09,718 --> 00:17:11,120
Okay, okay.

00:17:11,186 --> 00:17:13,389
They were all
on the clock last night.

00:17:13,455 --> 00:17:15,157
It was a bachelor party.

00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:20,029
(knock at door)

00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:21,463
CURTIS:
Nick, Mike,

00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,898
can you step out a minute?

00:17:27,936 --> 00:17:31,507
Miss McFarland is a
baby-sitter, of sorts.

00:17:31,573 --> 00:17:32,941
I wouldn't leave
her with my cat.

00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:34,376
I think
she likes the pipe.

00:17:34,443 --> 00:17:35,778
She claims that
that baby belongs

00:17:35,844 --> 00:17:37,179
to Courtney Evans.

00:17:37,246 --> 00:17:40,682
She had a baby? Damn.

00:17:40,749 --> 00:17:42,418
I'm going to call
Child Services.

00:17:42,484 --> 00:17:44,486
Yeah.

00:17:47,389 --> 00:17:50,426
Ma'am, I'm Nick Stokes;
this is Mike Keppler.

00:17:50,492 --> 00:17:51,527
We're with the Crime Lab.

00:17:51,593 --> 00:17:53,395
You mind if we ask
you a few questions?

00:17:53,462 --> 00:17:54,830
Um, look,
Courtney was supposed to come

00:17:54,897 --> 00:17:56,198
in the morning
to pick up Lila, okay.

00:17:56,265 --> 00:17:57,433
I got to work.

00:17:57,499 --> 00:17:58,734
You know, real work.

00:17:58,801 --> 00:18:00,436
Okay, look,

00:18:00,502 --> 00:18:01,770
my own problems, okay?

00:18:01,837 --> 00:18:04,473
Otherwise, I would have taken
her myself, but, um,

00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,908
I ain't in no shape,

00:18:05,974 --> 00:18:07,676
okay?

00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,779
So, uh, you can
find her a family, right?

00:18:12,414 --> 00:18:14,249
What about the father?

00:18:14,316 --> 00:18:15,851
Heard he was in prison
or something like that.

00:18:15,918 --> 00:18:17,219
I ain't never seen him.

00:18:17,286 --> 00:18:19,488
When she left the baby with you,
was Courtney with anyone?

00:18:19,555 --> 00:18:21,023
A friend maybe?

00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,559
No, no, she ain't got
no friends.

00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:24,793
What about enemies?

00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,195
You know what?

00:18:26,261 --> 00:18:28,397
I got to go. I can't take this.

00:18:28,464 --> 00:18:29,798
Mm-mm,
please take her.

00:18:29,865 --> 00:18:30,799
Thank you.

00:18:30,866 --> 00:18:31,800
Please.

00:18:31,867 --> 00:18:33,302
Go with her.
I got to go.

00:18:36,138 --> 00:18:37,339
Oh.

00:18:37,406 --> 00:18:40,976
Looks like we have
another victim, huh?

00:18:43,946 --> 00:18:45,948
It's gonna be okay, baby.

00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,428
We got to talk, Frank.

00:18:59,495 --> 00:19:01,430
Hold on, hold on,
I'm on a streak here.

00:19:01,497 --> 00:19:03,899
Now, do I keep the ace
or draw the inside straight?

00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:05,134
I'm gonna draw
to the straight.

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,003
She had a kid.

00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,939
Oh, God.

00:19:12,975 --> 00:19:14,676
Why don't you tell
me about the hand?

00:19:16,712 --> 00:19:18,647
Why?

00:19:18,714 --> 00:19:21,316
She scratched me, Mike.

00:19:21,383 --> 00:19:23,485
Come on, what was I
supposed to do?

00:19:23,552 --> 00:19:25,621
I couldn't take the chance
that one of your guys

00:19:25,688 --> 00:19:28,323
would find my DNA
under her nails.

00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:31,860
Why, Frank?

00:19:31,927 --> 00:19:33,595
You know why.

00:19:33,662 --> 00:19:35,764
That was a long time ago;
Dennis never said a word.

00:19:35,831 --> 00:19:37,966
Yeah, but he was going to.

00:19:38,033 --> 00:19:39,201
He was about to be indicted.

00:19:39,268 --> 00:19:40,402
Wife, three kids.

00:19:40,469 --> 00:19:42,171
There was no way
he was doing time.

00:19:42,237 --> 00:19:45,040
He was going down, Mikey,
and he was taking us with him.

00:19:45,107 --> 00:19:47,810
He was a cop, Frank.

00:19:47,876 --> 00:19:50,179
Yeah.
You told me that.

00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:51,346
You don't do that,

00:19:51,413 --> 00:19:53,348
not even to save
your own ass.
Yeah?

00:19:53,415 --> 00:19:55,017
What about yours? Hey!

00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:56,385
Give me another vodka
and tonic.

00:19:56,452 --> 00:19:59,154
And give my boy here
a scotch.

00:19:59,221 --> 00:20:00,522
Neat, right?

00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:01,790
Make it a double.

00:20:01,857 --> 00:20:04,026
We got to loosen him up.

00:20:04,093 --> 00:20:05,194
(chuckles)

00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,762
Look at her.

00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:08,397
Just like catnip.

00:20:10,366 --> 00:20:12,000
Don't look at me
like that, Mike.

00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:14,737
We did the right thing,
all of us.

00:20:14,803 --> 00:20:16,372
But do you think

00:20:16,438 --> 00:20:18,073
the grand jury's gonna
see it like that?

00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,877
They're gonna see a white cop
turned "Dirty Harry"

00:20:21,944 --> 00:20:23,045
goes across the river

00:20:23,112 --> 00:20:25,547
to take out some Puerto
Rican drug dealer.

00:20:25,614 --> 00:20:26,882
Shoots him in the back.

00:20:26,949 --> 00:20:28,217
They don't understand.

00:20:28,283 --> 00:20:31,020
Every time we take one step
outside the box

00:20:31,086 --> 00:20:33,689
for public safety,
they nail our asses to the wall.

00:20:33,756 --> 00:20:35,324
Sit down, Frank.
Hey, Mikey,

00:20:35,391 --> 00:20:36,558
there's no turning back.

00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,760
You did the right thing.

00:20:37,826 --> 00:20:39,395
If you hadn't taken care
of that evidence...

00:20:39,461 --> 00:20:41,764
Keep your voice
down, all right?

00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,832
Come on, I need some help here.

00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,236
Or you're gonna lose
everything.

00:20:47,302 --> 00:20:48,737
And that isn't
what Amy would have wanted.

00:20:48,804 --> 00:20:49,905
She loved you.

00:20:49,972 --> 00:20:51,206
Don't do that.

00:20:51,273 --> 00:20:52,408
What?

00:20:52,474 --> 00:20:54,009
Don't bring her into this.
You think

00:20:54,076 --> 00:20:55,310
you're the only one
who cared for her?

00:20:55,377 --> 00:20:56,779
I was her father, Mikey.

00:20:56,845 --> 00:20:58,947
Don't ever forget that.

00:21:02,518 --> 00:21:04,586
I would've killed
that the scumbag

00:21:04,653 --> 00:21:06,288
who raped her with
these bare hands,

00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:08,924
but you got
to him first.

00:21:09,825 --> 00:21:12,961
I love you
for that.

00:21:13,028 --> 00:21:15,764
Yeah, I made
compromises for you.

00:21:15,831 --> 00:21:18,067
You wouldn't be here now
if it wasn't for me.

00:21:20,102 --> 00:21:22,037
Yeah.

00:21:22,104 --> 00:21:23,772
Yeah.

00:21:25,441 --> 00:21:26,775
You're out of line, Frank.

00:21:26,842 --> 00:21:29,878
Hey, Mikey, there is no
statute of limitations

00:21:29,945 --> 00:21:32,147
for murder.

00:21:32,214 --> 00:21:36,318
The kid you shot,
his mother's still crying.

00:21:36,385 --> 00:21:39,021
And I got the gun...

00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:41,690
with your prints
and his blood on it.

00:21:44,626 --> 00:21:46,595
You go down now,

00:21:46,662 --> 00:21:51,300
you take every case
you ever worked on with you.

00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:56,171
Trenton, Philly,
Baltimore, Vegas.

00:21:56,238 --> 00:21:58,273
All those killers go free.

00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,343
All on your hands.

00:22:03,512 --> 00:22:07,316
So, pin it on the blond
in the bathroom

00:22:07,383 --> 00:22:08,751
or the pimp.

00:22:08,817 --> 00:22:11,353
Just do it, I don't care how,
just do it.

00:22:18,415 --> 00:22:20,116
(sniffs)

00:22:24,721 --> 00:22:26,456
I don't even know Courtney
what's-her-name.

00:22:26,523 --> 00:22:27,958
BROWN:
So how is it

00:22:28,024 --> 00:22:30,193
that your prints ended up
all over her apartment?

00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,162
I've never been
to her apartment.

00:22:32,229 --> 00:22:34,798
Did I mention
she was dead?

00:22:34,865 --> 00:22:36,700
What?

00:22:36,766 --> 00:22:38,635
Yo, I don't even know
no dead person.

00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:41,938
PJ, you know what I think?

00:22:42,005 --> 00:22:43,673
I think you killed her.

00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,408
You took her purse,

00:22:45,475 --> 00:22:47,477
went to her apartment
and stole all her stuff.

00:22:47,544 --> 00:22:48,945
No, no, no. I
didn't kill nobody.

00:22:49,012 --> 00:22:50,146
Well, she's dead.

00:22:50,213 --> 00:22:52,449
And so is the cop she was with.

00:22:52,516 --> 00:22:54,618
That's the death penalty.

00:22:54,684 --> 00:22:56,953
Here's what happened-- I swear,
this-- this is the truth.

00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,288
<i>I was minding my own business.</i>

00:22:58,355 --> 00:23:00,957
<i>I was checking out</i>
<i>the Dumpsters behind,</i>

00:23:01,024 --> 00:23:02,359
<i>behind the Strip,</i>

00:23:02,425 --> 00:23:04,694
<i>and lo and behold,</i>
<i>I find this lady's purse.</i>

00:23:04,761 --> 00:23:07,564
Right there in the Dumpster?
Yeah, like pennies from heaven.

00:23:07,631 --> 00:23:10,600
It had a wallet,
it had keys, it
had a cell phone.

00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:13,136
So I checked for her
license, I got her address

00:23:13,203 --> 00:23:14,504
and went to her house.

00:23:14,571 --> 00:23:16,706
I was going to return
the purse, I swear.

00:23:16,773 --> 00:23:18,708
Oh, like a Good Samaritan?

00:23:18,775 --> 00:23:20,410
Yeah, but, when I got here,
no one was there.

00:23:20,477 --> 00:23:22,012
So what'd you do?

00:23:22,078 --> 00:23:23,146
I used the key.

00:23:23,213 --> 00:23:24,981
I was going to leave
the purse inside.

00:23:25,048 --> 00:23:28,218
But you didn't
do that, did you?

00:23:28,285 --> 00:23:30,720
I might have taken
a couple of things.

00:23:30,787 --> 00:23:32,255
Where was the Dumpster?

00:23:32,322 --> 00:23:33,757
Behind the Palermo.

00:23:33,823 --> 00:23:36,026
(phone rings)
Behind the Palermo.

00:23:36,092 --> 00:23:37,260
This is Catherine.

00:23:37,327 --> 00:23:38,261
Catherine, it's Mike.

00:23:38,328 --> 00:23:39,362
Mike.

00:23:39,429 --> 00:23:41,431
Where have you been?

00:23:41,498 --> 00:23:43,200
I had to take care of something.

00:23:43,266 --> 00:23:45,101
How's it going?
Any I.D. on the blonde yet?

00:23:45,168 --> 00:23:48,238
No, but we got some info
from the deadbeat

00:23:48,305 --> 00:23:50,106
who burgled the hooker's
apartment.

00:23:50,173 --> 00:23:52,776
Claims he found her purse in
a Dumpster behind the Palermo.

00:23:52,843 --> 00:23:55,912
I'm just off the Strip now;
I'll take care of it for you.

00:23:55,979 --> 00:23:58,014
Mike, are you okay?

00:23:58,081 --> 00:24:00,083
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,919
I'll see you in a little bit.

00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,822

Hey, Mike.

00:25:28,205 --> 00:25:29,639
Hey.

00:25:29,706 --> 00:25:32,475
Did you get anything
from the Dumpster?

00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:33,844
Yeah...

00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,346
a bad smell.

00:25:36,413 --> 00:25:38,148
So...

00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:41,985
Ecklie wants you on days now
that Grissom's back, but...

00:25:42,052 --> 00:25:46,056
I could talk to them,
get you to stay with us.

00:25:46,122 --> 00:25:49,059
Oh, I'm sure you guys will do
just fine without me.

00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:50,493
(chuckles)

00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,329
Yeah, usually transfers
don't fit in,

00:25:52,395 --> 00:25:55,732
but... think about it.

00:25:57,534 --> 00:25:58,902
Catherine.

00:26:01,404 --> 00:26:04,241
Thanks.

00:26:21,358 --> 00:26:22,492
Keppler.

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,361
Archie found
the mystery blonde.

00:26:24,427 --> 00:26:26,596
Before she was in
Dennis Graves' room,

00:26:26,663 --> 00:26:29,065
she was with that cop,
Frank McCarty.

00:26:29,132 --> 00:26:31,601
They got on in the
lobby, got off on 11.

00:26:31,668 --> 00:26:32,669
Around the time McCarty

00:26:32,736 --> 00:26:34,371
said Dennis picked
up his hooker.

00:26:34,437 --> 00:26:36,773
STOKES:
Hey, he never mentioned
he had company,

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,376
and he knew we were looking
for another hooker.

00:26:39,442 --> 00:26:42,179
Now I'm starting to think
we're looking at a dirty cop.

00:26:42,245 --> 00:26:44,948
Who knows about this?
PD's about to.

00:26:45,015 --> 00:26:47,684
I'm calling them right now.

00:26:47,751 --> 00:26:51,888
JOHNSON:
You'd think a cop would
know he's on camera, huh?

00:26:54,591 --> 00:26:57,694
CURTIS:
<i>McCarty's phone</i>
<i>keeps going to voice mail.</i>

00:26:57,761 --> 00:26:59,029
And, according
to the receptionist,

00:26:59,095 --> 00:27:00,864
he didn't check out.

00:27:02,499 --> 00:27:05,468
LVPD. Open up.

00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,938
Give me the card.

00:27:36,867 --> 00:27:40,437
(sobbing fading in)

00:27:40,503 --> 00:27:43,773
I didn't do it...
I didn't do it, man.

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,475
Come on, man;
I didn't do it.

00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:47,244
You got the
wrong guy, man.

00:27:49,212 --> 00:27:50,313
(gunfire)

00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,515
No!

00:27:51,581 --> 00:27:53,650
CURTIS:
It's a .45 auto.

00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:59,823
Same caliber as the gun that
killed the cop and the hooker.

00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,758
With blood stains.

00:28:01,825 --> 00:28:04,127
STOKES:
This this is
practically gift-wrapped.

00:28:04,194 --> 00:28:06,429
If the guy wants
to get caught so bad,

00:28:06,496 --> 00:28:10,133
just confess, make it easy
on all of us.

00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,702
I can't wait to get
this back to Ballistics.

00:28:12,769 --> 00:28:14,371
I'll see you.

00:28:16,006 --> 00:28:18,175
I'll finish up here.

00:28:33,623 --> 00:28:36,393
(phone rings)

00:28:36,459 --> 00:28:37,994
(recording):
You've reached Frank.

00:28:38,061 --> 00:28:39,563
Leave me a message
after the tone.

00:28:39,629 --> 00:28:41,731
(beeping)

00:28:44,534 --> 00:28:47,237
Sara.

00:28:47,304 --> 00:28:49,406
Hey. You're back.

00:28:49,472 --> 00:28:50,407
Yeah.

00:28:50,473 --> 00:28:52,175
Uh, I've-- I've been out
at a, um...

00:28:52,242 --> 00:28:54,678
I've been at...
A garbage dump?
Yeah.

00:28:54,744 --> 00:28:56,613
It's so obvious, isn't it?

00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,014
Nice, um...

00:28:59,416 --> 00:29:00,550
You look good.

00:29:00,617 --> 00:29:04,020
Did you, uh, put the
cocoon in my office?

00:29:04,087 --> 00:29:06,189
Cool, dry,
not a lot of light.

00:29:06,256 --> 00:29:07,724
It seemed like
the right place for it.

00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:09,926
I think you're going to be
surprised when it hatches.

00:29:09,993 --> 00:29:11,261
I have no doubt.

00:29:11,328 --> 00:29:13,029
I'm gonna...

00:29:13,096 --> 00:29:14,698
go clean up now.

00:29:16,132 --> 00:29:17,300
I'll see you later.

00:29:18,335 --> 00:29:21,037
Yeah, you will.

00:29:23,773 --> 00:29:26,376
McCarty's mystery blonde
knew the dead hooker.

00:29:26,443 --> 00:29:27,978
How do you know that?

00:29:28,044 --> 00:29:29,579
(typing)

00:29:29,646 --> 00:29:31,348
Check out the
time code.

00:29:31,414 --> 00:29:32,516
1:10.

00:29:32,582 --> 00:29:34,584
We recovered the
hooker's cell phone,

00:29:34,651 --> 00:29:36,419
thanks to a Dumpster diver.

00:29:36,486 --> 00:29:38,421
These are all her voice mails,
the last couple hours

00:29:38,488 --> 00:29:39,956
before she died.

00:29:40,023 --> 00:29:42,559
At the same time the
blond was making this call,

00:29:42,626 --> 00:29:44,861
Courtney Evans
received a voice mail.

00:29:44,928 --> 00:29:47,964
So, I synched up
the audio to the video.

00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:53,236
Yeah, Courty, it's me,
Suzy Q. Got your message.

00:29:53,303 --> 00:29:56,173
What are you,
too busy to answer me back?

00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:57,874
Uh, so anyway,
I just left my guy.

00:29:57,941 --> 00:30:00,644
Eh, it went all right.

00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,346
Usual "Call me Daddy" crap.

00:30:03,413 --> 00:30:04,714
(laughs)

00:30:04,781 --> 00:30:07,817
You know, he actually wanted me
to whimper. Whatever.

00:30:07,884 --> 00:30:10,253
He kept calling me "Amy."

00:30:11,288 --> 00:30:14,391
(woman whimpering)

00:30:15,392 --> 00:30:16,726
KEPPLER:
<i>Amy?</i>

00:30:16,793 --> 00:30:18,328
...that three-way...

00:30:18,395 --> 00:30:20,830
I don't know, I don't know.
I think I'm gonna have to--

00:30:20,897 --> 00:30:22,532
Do we have an I.D.
on the blonde?

00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:24,734
Just now.

00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:26,336
I just finished running names

00:30:26,403 --> 00:30:28,772
off Courtney Evans'
incoming calls.
Yeah?

00:30:28,838 --> 00:30:30,440
JOHNSON:
We're looking for Suzy Gibbons.

00:30:30,507 --> 00:30:31,675
WILLOWS:
Here it is.

00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:37,013
Priors for prostitution
and a last known.

00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,481
Can I see that?

00:30:38,548 --> 00:30:40,884
JOHNSON:
She knew the vic.

00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:44,020
She's the blonde in the bathtub.

00:30:44,087 --> 00:30:45,755
Well, if we can find Suzy,
so can a retired cop.

00:30:45,822 --> 00:30:47,123
He needs her dead.

00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,526
KEPPLER:
If she's dumb enough to
hide out in her own house,

00:30:49,593 --> 00:30:51,094
she already is.

00:30:51,161 --> 00:30:52,929
Mike?

00:30:52,996 --> 00:30:54,731
Mike, where are you going?!

00:31:24,961 --> 00:31:26,863
♪ ♪

00:31:37,274 --> 00:31:38,441
(device beeping)

00:32:00,327 --> 00:32:02,496
Amy?

00:32:24,585 --> 00:32:27,354
(distorted):
Daddy said

00:32:27,421 --> 00:32:30,357
never tell you.

00:32:33,094 --> 00:32:35,096
(car horn honking)

00:32:42,069 --> 00:32:43,738
Why would McCarty
have a bloody gun

00:32:43,804 --> 00:32:45,706
with Keppler's prints on
it, in his hotel room?

00:32:45,773 --> 00:32:46,707
Doesn't make any sense.

00:32:46,774 --> 00:32:47,842
No.

00:32:47,908 --> 00:32:49,510
Could Mike have touched
it when he found it?

00:32:49,577 --> 00:32:50,511
No, no way.

00:32:50,578 --> 00:32:51,545
I was right there.

00:32:51,612 --> 00:32:53,147
Besides, the blood
was already dry.

00:32:53,214 --> 00:32:55,616
You don't leave fingerprints
in dried blood.

00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:57,885
I compared
the .45 ammo evidence

00:32:57,952 --> 00:32:59,720
to the dead cop
and the hooker.

00:32:59,787 --> 00:33:01,889
It's the correct make,
model and caliber,

00:33:01,956 --> 00:33:05,326
but I'm telling you,
it's a different gun.

00:33:05,392 --> 00:33:06,393
Maybe he's
being set up.

00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,394
GRISSOM:
<i>Why?</i>

00:33:07,461 --> 00:33:08,996
By whom?

00:33:09,063 --> 00:33:10,731
Keppler told me that
he didn't know Frank McCarty.

00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:12,666
He also said he didn't
know the victim.

00:33:12,733 --> 00:33:15,436
Maybe he's lying
about that, too.

00:33:15,503 --> 00:33:17,338
I'm sorry, Catherine.
I like the guy, too,

00:33:17,405 --> 00:33:18,939
but I'm just following
the evidence here.

00:33:19,006 --> 00:33:21,275
We should be talking
to Keppler about this.

00:33:21,342 --> 00:33:23,010
Where is he?

00:33:23,077 --> 00:33:24,478
He was with me in A/V.

00:33:24,545 --> 00:33:27,314
Nobody has seen him since,
and he's not answering his cell.

00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:28,716
STOKES:
He knows where

00:33:28,783 --> 00:33:29,884
the eyewitness lives.

00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,685
What are you saying, Nick?

00:33:31,752 --> 00:33:32,920
I'm saying that

00:33:32,987 --> 00:33:34,989
if he had something to do
with these two murders,

00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:37,091
then Frank McCarty's
not the only one

00:33:37,158 --> 00:33:38,926
we need to
worry about.

00:33:38,993 --> 00:33:41,362
PD's on their way
to Suzy Gibbons' apartment now.

00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:43,030
GRISSOM:
Okay, grab Sara
and go over there,

00:33:43,097 --> 00:33:44,465
and I'll have Brass
call Trenton PD,

00:33:44,532 --> 00:33:45,566
see who knows who.

00:33:45,633 --> 00:33:47,768
Welcome home.

00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:53,207
What other evidence did, uh,

00:33:53,274 --> 00:33:54,508
Keppler handle?

00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:56,010
STOKES:
He brought back
the three bullets

00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:59,346
from Autopsy, which didn't match
the gun with his prints on it.

00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:01,949
Could he have swapped
the bullets?

00:34:02,016 --> 00:34:03,784
Anything's possible.

00:34:03,851 --> 00:34:05,686
BROWN:
He also searched
the Dumpster

00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:08,222
where the homeless guy found the
hooker's purse and cell phone.

00:34:08,289 --> 00:34:09,256
He told Catherine

00:34:09,323 --> 00:34:10,658
he didn't
find anything.

00:34:10,724 --> 00:34:13,094
I got your DNA results,
and the blood

00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,096
on the gun from
Frank McCarty's hotel room,

00:34:15,162 --> 00:34:16,130
it doesn't match
either victim.

00:34:16,197 --> 00:34:17,832
There were no hits in CODIS,

00:34:17,898 --> 00:34:19,366
and the DNA print
ancestry markers

00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:21,302
say that it's from a black male.

00:34:21,368 --> 00:34:23,571
Keppler and McCarty
were both Jersey boys.

00:34:23,637 --> 00:34:25,573
Expand the search
to the East Coast.

00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,041
Will do.

00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:29,410
I really hope he's clean.

00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:33,247
We have to treat
him like a suspect.

00:34:33,314 --> 00:34:34,782
I'll tell Ecklie.

00:34:34,849 --> 00:34:36,851
(cell phone ringing)

00:34:42,056 --> 00:34:44,291
Still no answer on his cell.

00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:45,326
Hey.

00:34:45,392 --> 00:34:47,428
Got a fix on the GPS
in his Denali.

00:34:49,497 --> 00:34:50,765
He's near Henderson.

00:34:50,831 --> 00:34:51,866
What's he doing there?

00:35:03,043 --> 00:35:04,645
(beeping)

00:35:04,712 --> 00:35:06,180
He just disabled his GPS.

00:35:06,247 --> 00:35:07,348
Smart guy.

00:35:07,415 --> 00:35:08,682
Guilty guy.

00:35:08,749 --> 00:35:10,117
Try tracking his cell.

00:35:10,184 --> 00:35:11,786
PD-issued phones
have GPS, too.

00:35:11,852 --> 00:35:13,154
Yeah.

00:35:15,923 --> 00:35:17,725
Got him.

00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:27,034
(speaking Asian language)

00:35:27,101 --> 00:35:29,270
Okay?

00:35:33,707 --> 00:35:34,742
I'll take that.

00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:36,277
(grunts)
Suzy Gibbons--
how do I find her?

00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:37,812
Okay, you know what?

00:35:37,878 --> 00:35:39,346
First off, you're gonna get
your freakin' hands off me.

00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:43,350
I don't have time, Ricky.

00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:46,120
Why should
I tell you?

00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:47,788
Because if you don't...

00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:49,790
(cocks gun)

00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:52,893
I'm the last face
you're gonna see alive.

00:35:56,464 --> 00:35:59,567
I don't think Suzy
works out of here.

00:35:59,633 --> 00:36:01,102
Me, either.

00:36:01,168 --> 00:36:02,169
(cell phone ringing)

00:36:05,072 --> 00:36:06,640
Jim?

00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:09,677
BRASS:
So I finally got through to
the Homicide captain in Trenton.

00:36:09,744 --> 00:36:11,645
Anyway, here's the story.

00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:13,414
Keppler not only knew McCarty.

00:36:13,481 --> 00:36:15,983
Not only did he know him,

00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,052
he was like a son to him.

00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:20,521
Keppler had a close relationship
with his daughter,

00:36:20,588 --> 00:36:23,424
and McCarty was the one who got
Keppler his job as a CSI.

00:36:23,491 --> 00:36:27,228
And what about the victim--
Detective Graves?

00:36:27,294 --> 00:36:28,863
Yeah, he knew him, too.

00:36:28,929 --> 00:36:30,097
Graves was being indicted.

00:36:30,164 --> 00:36:31,866
Seems like too many
of his suspects

00:36:31,932 --> 00:36:34,135
were showing up dead
before the trial.

00:36:34,201 --> 00:36:36,003
Catherine, I think
all three of them are dirty.

00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:38,973
Okay.

00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:42,042
You know,
some women...

00:36:42,109 --> 00:36:45,112
live out of
their purses.

00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:48,549
I know a lot of working girls
operate out of the Siren.

00:36:48,616 --> 00:36:50,017
I think we just
found her office.

00:36:50,084 --> 00:36:51,786
(cell phone ringing)

00:36:51,852 --> 00:36:53,587
I'll see you
back at the lab?

00:36:53,654 --> 00:36:54,789
Okay.

00:36:57,024 --> 00:36:58,359
Hello.

00:36:58,426 --> 00:37:00,227
It's Mike.

00:37:00,294 --> 00:37:01,228
Where have you been?

00:37:01,295 --> 00:37:02,930
Everybody is looking for you.

00:37:02,997 --> 00:37:04,298
I know.

00:37:04,365 --> 00:37:05,766
I'm sorry.

00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:08,069
Then come back in.

00:37:08,135 --> 00:37:09,570
I can't.

00:37:09,637 --> 00:37:10,971
It's kind of complicated.

00:37:11,038 --> 00:37:14,708
I... made a mistake
a long time ago.

00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:16,577
Let me help you.

00:37:16,644 --> 00:37:19,847
It's too late.

00:37:19,914 --> 00:37:21,749
You're gonna end up looking

00:37:21,816 --> 00:37:23,517
into my cases, Catherine.

00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,752
(sighs)

00:37:24,819 --> 00:37:26,720
They're clean.

00:37:26,787 --> 00:37:29,123
I promise, every one of them.

00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,492
Except the Alvarez homicide
in Philly.

00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:34,895
If you run the ballistics again,

00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:36,764
it'll come back
to Dennis Graves.

00:37:36,831 --> 00:37:39,467
Your guys are smart,
they'll figure it out.

00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:43,270
Mike, don't do anything stupid.

00:37:43,337 --> 00:37:44,872
I got to go.

00:37:44,939 --> 00:37:45,973
(phone beeps)

00:37:48,476 --> 00:37:49,643
(line ringing)

00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,678
McCARTY:
<i>Hey, you've reached Frank.</i>

00:37:50,745 --> 00:37:51,679
<i>Leave me a message</i>

00:37:51,746 --> 00:37:52,880
after the tone.
(beep)

00:37:52,947 --> 00:37:54,381
If you still want
to fix this, Frank,

00:37:54,448 --> 00:37:56,450
you got 20 minutes.

00:37:56,517 --> 00:38:00,454
Blue Siren Motel,
Third, below Fremont.

00:38:16,537 --> 00:38:18,539
(cell phone rings)

00:38:24,011 --> 00:38:24,945
Grissom.

00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:28,649
He just called,
sounded desperate.

00:38:28,716 --> 00:38:31,585
Like a man with nothing
to live for and nothing to lose.

00:38:31,652 --> 00:38:33,287
Well, he's not your priority.

00:38:33,354 --> 00:38:35,122
Find the witness.

00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:37,358
Yeah. I'm on my way.

00:38:37,425 --> 00:38:39,293
Just wanted you to know.

00:38:47,101 --> 00:38:49,036
(knock at door)
It's open.

00:38:53,874 --> 00:38:55,776
(gasps)

00:38:57,278 --> 00:39:00,047
Drop it, Frank.

00:39:00,114 --> 00:39:02,483
Put the gun down.

00:39:04,752 --> 00:39:07,421
Look, Mike...

00:39:07,488 --> 00:39:09,423
about the bar,
you were right.

00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,225
I was out of line.

00:39:11,292 --> 00:39:13,861
You know how I get--
come on.

00:39:13,928 --> 00:39:14,895
Put the gun down.

00:39:14,962 --> 00:39:16,230
You're not gonna shoot me.

00:39:16,297 --> 00:39:17,798
Suzy, I want
you to get up

00:39:17,865 --> 00:39:19,467
and walk out of the
room, all right?

00:39:19,533 --> 00:39:20,634
I can't let that happen.

00:39:20,701 --> 00:39:22,103
Sit down.
(sobbing)

00:39:23,537 --> 00:39:25,773
It's over, Frank.

00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,074
I know what you did.

00:39:27,141 --> 00:39:29,043
What are you talking about?

00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,612
I know what you did to Amy.

00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:39,487
I killed an innocent man.

00:39:39,553 --> 00:39:40,621
Mikey,

00:39:40,688 --> 00:39:42,289
you're talking crazy.

00:39:42,356 --> 00:39:43,924
She was your daughter, Frank.

00:39:43,991 --> 00:39:44,925
You watch your frickin' mouth.

00:39:44,992 --> 00:39:47,361
All right, okay!
Put the gun down.
(Gibbons sobbing)

00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:48,262
Shut up!

00:39:51,966 --> 00:39:54,769
I loved her, Mike,
more than you know.

00:39:54,835 --> 00:39:56,404
All right, okay.

00:39:58,439 --> 00:40:01,709
I'm a dirty cop,
rotten to the core.

00:40:01,776 --> 00:40:03,077
What do you want from me?

00:40:07,815 --> 00:40:11,318
(siren approaching)

00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:24,098
I want you
to tell me why, Frank.

00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:29,437
Why you would do that
to your own daughter.

00:40:29,503 --> 00:40:30,838
Come on, Mike.

00:40:30,905 --> 00:40:31,939
You're all I've got.

00:40:32,006 --> 00:40:33,941
(sobbing):
No! No!

00:40:35,676 --> 00:40:36,811
(screaming)

00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:43,651
Mike!

00:40:45,553 --> 00:40:46,454
Mike.

00:40:49,423 --> 00:40:52,293
(gunshots)

00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:55,196
(grunting)

00:40:57,198 --> 00:40:58,966
Mike.

00:40:59,033 --> 00:41:00,468
Mike.

00:41:00,534 --> 00:41:01,936
Mike, hang in there.

00:41:02,002 --> 00:41:03,304
Call the paramedics.

00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:05,005
Dispatch,
got a Code 44.

00:41:05,072 --> 00:41:06,107
You're gonna be okay.

00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:08,375
Just stay with me.

00:41:09,777 --> 00:41:12,179
I'm sorry.

00:41:12,246 --> 00:41:13,848
I just know
they both had guns.

00:41:13,914 --> 00:41:16,083
Move it.
Pupils still fixed and dilated.

00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,685
He's moving into V-fib!
Let's go!
I'm here.

00:41:17,752 --> 00:41:19,954
Stay with me, Mike.
Place him into the back
of the rig.

00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,689
Mike?

00:41:21,756 --> 00:41:23,591
Let's go, let's go.
Hang on, Mike.

00:41:26,594 --> 00:41:28,395
Charging, 300.
(high-pitched electrical whine)

00:41:28,462 --> 00:41:29,396
Two placement's good.
Clear.

00:41:29,463 --> 00:41:30,297
Clear.

00:41:30,364 --> 00:41:31,832
(electrical thud)

00:41:31,899 --> 00:41:33,467
No response.
Hitting him again.

00:41:33,534 --> 00:41:34,535
(high-pitched electrical whine)
Copy. Clear.

00:41:34,602 --> 00:41:35,803
(electrical thud)

00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:38,706
Yeah, I've got nothing.

00:41:38,773 --> 00:41:41,008
Still in V-fib.
Come on, come on.

00:41:41,075 --> 00:41:43,010
(high-pitched electrical whine)
(electrical thud)

00:41:47,648 --> 00:41:48,649
No pulse.

00:41:48,716 --> 00:41:50,017
What?

00:41:50,084 --> 00:41:51,118
He's gone.

00:42:19,613 --> 00:42:21,449
BROWN:
<i>Talk to me, Archie.</i>

00:42:21,515 --> 00:42:25,152
JOHNSON:
The signal's 20 yards north
of your position.

00:42:25,219 --> 00:42:27,621
I don't see anything.

00:42:27,688 --> 00:42:29,023
I'm dialing the phone now.

00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:31,692
All right.

00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:33,394
(faint cell phone ringing)

00:42:33,461 --> 00:42:35,496
Hey, wait, wait,
wait, wait!

00:42:35,563 --> 00:42:37,031
I got something.

00:42:37,098 --> 00:42:38,866
I'll call you back.

00:42:38,933 --> 00:42:40,935
(faint cell phone ringing)

00:42:55,483 --> 00:42:58,753
(cell phone ringing)

00:43:00,187 --> 00:43:03,657
Keppler left his phone
so we'd find the hand.

00:43:08,129 --> 00:43:09,230
"Check under the nails.

00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:12,733
You'll find
Frank McCarty's DNA.
