It's... kind of up close
and personal for this killer.

00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:31,985
Hodges ran fabric,
paint,

00:11:32,051 --> 00:11:34,387
glue, and plastic samples
of the Trevor doll.

00:11:34,454 --> 00:11:36,856
The materials were consistent
with the previous Minis.

00:11:36,923 --> 00:11:38,024
No luck with that print?

00:11:38,091 --> 00:11:39,092
It was only
a partial,

00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:40,326
not enough to put
through AFIS.

00:11:40,393 --> 00:11:42,462
But there were epithelials
in the print.

00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:43,696
Wendy's running DNA.

00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:55,542
Hello there.
Can I help you?

00:11:58,678 --> 00:12:01,114
I need to order a special part.

00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:04,184
Well, why don't you just
check out our spaceship isle.

00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,852
Yeah.

00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,020
I'll be right
with you

00:12:07,087 --> 00:12:08,621
after I help this little
fellow over here.

00:12:11,658 --> 00:12:14,594
Look, you really need to
buy these polyhedral dice.

00:12:14,661 --> 00:12:16,229
Just in case.

00:12:16,296 --> 00:12:18,298
You're always
losing them, man.

00:12:27,774 --> 00:12:29,409
I just come from
the police.

00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:31,377
They showed me your
miniatures and
they showed me

00:12:31,444 --> 00:12:32,712
some pictures of
some dead people.

00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:34,047
The cops know
I helped you

00:12:34,114 --> 00:12:35,915
put some of that stuff together.

00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,585
They know I delivered
that package

00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:39,886
to the old lady's house,

00:12:39,953 --> 00:12:41,221
like you asked
me to.

00:12:41,287 --> 00:12:42,956
They think I killed,
I killed all those people.

00:12:43,022 --> 00:12:44,424
You didn't?

00:12:44,491 --> 00:12:46,292
Natalie, did you kill them?

00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:49,963
Did you kill those people?

00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:52,031
Yes.

00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:56,970
Why?

00:12:57,036 --> 00:12:59,706
They're going to put
you in jail, honey.

00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,742
(sighs)

00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:08,381
Unless there's something else?

00:13:10,183 --> 00:13:12,118
If you had a good reason...

00:13:12,185 --> 00:13:14,187
they'll listen to that.

00:13:16,322 --> 00:13:18,324
Raymundo...

00:13:19,426 --> 00:13:22,128
...did he put his
hands on you?

00:13:22,195 --> 00:13:24,197
Yes...

00:13:24,264 --> 00:13:27,133
that smell...

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,303
And the old lady?

00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,206
And that pervert
rock star?

00:13:33,273 --> 00:13:36,142
If they done something to you
just tell me what it was.

00:13:41,181 --> 00:13:43,583
Honey...

00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,185
I know there's some
people out there

00:13:45,251 --> 00:13:46,553
that deserve killin'...

00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:52,559
and you... you had good
reason to kill 'em, right?

00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,494
Yes.

00:13:54,561 --> 00:13:56,563
All right.

00:14:02,302 --> 00:14:04,337
I want you to listen to me.

00:14:04,404 --> 00:14:07,040
What you've done
is done.

00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:09,042
I can't fix that.

00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:12,112
But I can still
take care of you.

00:14:12,178 --> 00:14:15,749
I ain't going to let
the police get you.

00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:18,351
But you got to
promise me

00:14:18,418 --> 00:14:20,420
you won't kill
nobody else.

00:14:21,921 --> 00:14:25,658
Promise me you'll
be a good girl.

00:14:25,725 --> 00:14:28,194
(child-like):
Your special girl?

00:14:28,261 --> 00:14:29,562
That's right.

00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:31,664
My special girl.

00:14:31,731 --> 00:14:34,467
I promise.

00:14:43,443 --> 00:14:45,912
You were the one thing
I thought I'd done right.

00:15:19,655 --> 00:15:21,623
GRISSOM:
I found

00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,058
a thriving miniature
hobbyist

00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,526
community on line.

00:15:24,593 --> 00:15:25,961
Sites where people meet, chat,

00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:27,329
exchange building tips,

00:15:27,396 --> 00:15:29,231
list stores
they shop in.

00:15:29,297 --> 00:15:30,799
So that's why
you built this thing?

00:15:30,866 --> 00:15:32,567
I mean...

00:15:32,634 --> 00:15:34,403
other than
to creep us all out?

00:15:34,469 --> 00:15:36,972
Items like Trevor Dell's
metal bracelet

00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:39,741
are difficult to make, even
for skilled craftsmen.

00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:41,076
I'm trying to
find people

00:15:41,143 --> 00:15:43,178
who specialize
in miniature metal work.

00:15:45,547 --> 00:15:47,149
SIMMS:
Hey,

00:15:47,215 --> 00:15:49,017
I got DNA off the Trevor doll.

00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:51,219
There were two contributors:
the vic and an unknown.

00:15:51,286 --> 00:15:53,255
There was nothing
in CODIS, but...

00:15:53,322 --> 00:15:55,223
the unknown was XX.

00:15:57,726 --> 00:15:59,261
The Miniature Killer's a woman?

00:16:01,897 --> 00:16:04,266
Female serial killers
are rare enough.

00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,268
Delusional psychosis in women...

00:16:06,335 --> 00:16:07,803
rarer still.

00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:11,106
Well, "female" cuts the list
down a little bit.

00:16:11,173 --> 00:16:12,741
We could also narrow it down
even further

00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:14,676
by cross-referencing the dates
that Trevor lived with Ernie.

00:16:14,743 --> 00:16:16,411
I mean,
that's got

00:16:16,478 --> 00:16:18,880
to be enough to get the foster
records released, right?

00:16:18,947 --> 00:16:21,583
Family court judge was explicit:
"No fishing expeditions."

00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,251
We need to go in with a name.

00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:26,088
(beeping)

00:16:28,824 --> 00:16:31,193
Come on down
to Schuster's Hobby Shop.

00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:33,628
A whole world awaits you.

00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,802
GRISSOM:
I'll be back.

00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:41,970
I have to go see

00:16:42,037 --> 00:16:44,473
the Shadowcaster
of the Forgotten Realms.

00:16:52,147 --> 00:16:54,416
Unless the female killer
was an Amazon,

00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:56,318
I kind of doubt a guy
like this was just...

00:16:56,385 --> 00:16:57,486
beat around
his own bathroom.

00:16:57,552 --> 00:16:59,621
You have another theory?

00:16:59,688 --> 00:17:02,424
In the Penny Garden case,
the victim was...

00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:04,660
poisoned,

00:17:04,726 --> 00:17:06,662
then died falling
out a window

00:17:06,728 --> 00:17:07,929
after going into
convulsions.

00:17:07,996 --> 00:17:09,631
Right.

00:17:09,698 --> 00:17:11,166
In the Barbara
Tallman case,

00:17:11,233 --> 00:17:13,769
the method of murder was gassing

00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:15,837
but was disguised

00:17:15,904 --> 00:17:18,040
by potential poisoning
and suffocation.

00:17:18,106 --> 00:17:19,775
You think I overlooked
something?

00:17:19,841 --> 00:17:21,943
You know, I asked
for an expanded tox panel.

00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,313
It came back clean
as a whistle.
Well...

00:17:24,379 --> 00:17:26,782
take a look at this.

00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:29,418
That little
round spot...

00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:31,019
is that discoloration
consistent with decomp?

00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:33,188
Maybe not.

00:17:33,255 --> 00:17:34,856
And idea what it is?
No.

00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:36,925
But I can find out.

00:17:36,992 --> 00:17:38,060
GRISSOM:
Hello, Art.

00:17:38,126 --> 00:17:39,227
Well, hey,
Dr. Grissom.

00:17:39,294 --> 00:17:40,696
How's the, uh,
miniature going?

00:17:40,762 --> 00:17:42,698
Coming along,
thank you.

00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:44,032
We found another one.

00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:45,334
Oh, man.

00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,501
He struck again?

00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:48,503
I think so.

00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,874
By any chance,
did you make this bracelet?

00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:56,278
Oh, yeah, I made that.

00:17:56,345 --> 00:17:57,946
For a chick, man.

00:17:58,013 --> 00:17:59,481
Uh...

00:17:59,548 --> 00:18:01,650
let's see...

00:18:01,717 --> 00:18:03,752
Natalie.

00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:05,287
She have a last name?

00:18:05,354 --> 00:18:06,922
Uh, I-I didn't think
to write it down.

00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:08,657
"Paid cash.

00:18:08,724 --> 00:18:10,792
Call cell phone
when ready."

00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:12,961
It's the same cell number
we already have.

00:18:13,028 --> 00:18:14,396
Do you remember what
she looked like?

00:18:14,463 --> 00:18:15,897
Late 20s, early 30s...

00:18:15,964 --> 00:18:17,532
She's about yay high.

00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,234
Uh, brown hair.

00:18:19,301 --> 00:18:21,236
Uh, she's kind
of a Skinny chick.

00:18:21,303 --> 00:18:22,738
Weird.

00:18:22,804 --> 00:18:24,673
Weird how?
I got guys

00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,742
who come in here trying to
recreate Civil War battles

00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:27,876
hoping for a different outcome.

00:18:27,943 --> 00:18:29,478
I get the desperate
housewives who are trying

00:18:29,544 --> 00:18:31,913
to build the perfect
Thanksgiving dinner.

00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,682
Control freaks
with social problems

00:18:33,749 --> 00:18:36,151
that's my bread and butter,
but, uh, this chick, she had...

00:18:36,218 --> 00:18:37,486
crazy eyes, you know.

00:18:37,552 --> 00:18:39,921
Was that the last
time you saw her?

00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:41,189
You know what?

00:18:41,256 --> 00:18:43,125
She came in a few days ago.

00:18:43,191 --> 00:18:45,394
She... yeah!

00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,795
She bought one
of these.

00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:50,899
Battery powered
micro-motor?

00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:52,968
You just attach that to anything
you want to animate.

00:18:53,035 --> 00:18:54,136
Just like, uh...

00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:56,204
like this, see.

00:18:59,074 --> 00:19:01,743

From what?

00:20:29,631 --> 00:20:32,534
If I could tell you that,
you'd be out of a job.

00:20:34,202 --> 00:20:36,204
All the outlets in the bathroom
are dead.

00:20:38,307 --> 00:20:40,976
Must be on a separate circuit
than the lights.

00:20:42,411 --> 00:20:43,612
I just reset
the breaker.

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,614
That do the trick?

00:20:45,681 --> 00:20:47,049
(beeping)

00:20:47,115 --> 00:20:49,117
We're hot.

00:20:55,724 --> 00:20:57,826
What you got?

00:20:57,893 --> 00:20:59,795
Possible burn mark
on the tile.

00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:01,797
If this is where Trevor's foot
grounded out,

00:21:01,863 --> 00:21:03,932
he must've been at the sink
when he got zapped.

00:21:06,601 --> 00:21:08,603
The outlet doesn't
look scorched.

00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,810
Looks like
some burned skin.

00:21:14,876 --> 00:21:17,245
The sink is still damp.

00:21:17,312 --> 00:21:19,314
Hey, hit that crack.

00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:23,118
(beeping)

00:21:25,053 --> 00:21:29,091
I think we may have found
the Mini Killer's booby trap.

00:21:30,926 --> 00:21:32,294
(electrical buzzing,
Trevor moaning)

00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:40,702
Hot wire's touching one
of the metal brackets

00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:41,870
that's holding up
the sink.

00:21:41,937 --> 00:21:43,739
WILLOWS:
Sink is cracked,

00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:46,241
water pours in,
touches the bracket...

00:21:46,308 --> 00:21:48,243
Trevor touches
the water...

00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,678
zap.

00:21:49,745 --> 00:21:51,780
You can see where it's been rigged.

00:21:51,847 --> 00:21:54,683
Whoever tapped into
this power line

00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,552
must've gained access
from the apartment

00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:59,154
on the other side
of this wall.

00:21:59,221 --> 00:22:01,890
You're saying the killer's
the next door neighbor?

00:22:14,336 --> 00:22:15,671
(knocking)

00:22:17,673 --> 00:22:19,641
LVPD! Open the door!

00:22:33,388 --> 00:22:35,657
Hey, here's another one
for you.

00:22:35,724 --> 00:22:39,194
You sure, uh, get a lot
of packages...

00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,421
Oh!

00:23:09,996 --> 00:23:11,045
Oh, God!

00:23:16,624 --> 00:23:18,259
The big guy's
a wannabe composer.

00:23:18,325 --> 00:23:20,928
Quit his day job to write
the next <i>Dreamgirls.</i>

00:23:20,995 --> 00:23:22,596
Anyway, he didn't
pay his bills

00:23:22,663 --> 00:23:24,265
and the power company
shut off his lights.

00:23:24,331 --> 00:23:26,200
So the genius steals
power from his neighbor

00:23:26,267 --> 00:23:27,935
and ends up electrifying
Trevor's sink.

00:23:28,002 --> 00:23:30,771
Yeah, another weird
tragedy for the Dell family.

00:23:30,838 --> 00:23:32,940
Doesn't explain what
that doll was doing
there, though.

00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:34,308
Well, the guy
liked action figures.

00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,143
Maybe his sister,
the Miniature Killer,

00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,012
gave it to him as a gift.

00:23:46,687 --> 00:23:47,788
GRISSOM (on phone):
Grissom.

00:23:47,855 --> 00:23:50,224
Hey, Grissom, it's Sofia.

00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:52,226
"Female Dell foster child,
first name Natalie"

00:23:52,293 --> 00:23:53,861
was finally specific enough.

00:23:53,928 --> 00:23:57,565
Family Court just ordered CPS
to release her records.

00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:02,069
Sorry, did I totally
flake on an appointment?

00:24:02,136 --> 00:24:04,505
We're not with
Social Services.

00:24:04,572 --> 00:24:06,373
We're here to ask you
about a foster child

00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,075
you had a number
of years ago.

00:24:08,142 --> 00:24:09,410
Oh, geez.
You can try.

00:24:09,476 --> 00:24:10,678
We've had about 60.
Yeah, honey?

00:24:10,744 --> 00:24:11,946
You said we could
watch <i>Dora,</i>

00:24:12,012 --> 00:24:13,647
Mm-hmm.
but Simon's
watching soccer.

00:24:13,714 --> 00:24:16,217
Well, Simon has TV
privileges until
4:00, so tell him

00:24:16,283 --> 00:24:18,586
(chuckles) that now
it's your turn.

00:24:18,652 --> 00:24:21,255
Ha-ha!
Nicely please, thank you.

00:24:21,322 --> 00:24:23,090
Her birth name
was Natalie Davis.

00:24:23,157 --> 00:24:25,025
Mm-hmm.
She would've
been about seven

00:24:25,092 --> 00:24:27,261
when she came
to you in 1982.

00:24:27,328 --> 00:24:29,830
Oh, '82.
My God...

00:24:29,897 --> 00:24:31,232
Let's see.

00:24:31,298 --> 00:24:32,600
Let's take a look.

00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:33,934
What did you get?

00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:36,370
Oh! Good for you.

00:24:36,437 --> 00:24:37,605
Congratulations.

00:24:40,975 --> 00:24:42,943
Do you take a photo
of every child?

00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,378
Every single one,
their first night here.

00:24:44,445 --> 00:24:47,248
I just feel like it gives them
a sense of belonging right away.

00:24:47,314 --> 00:24:49,250
Most of them come to us
so damaged

00:24:49,316 --> 00:24:51,819
they don't know what it's like
to belong to anything.

00:24:51,886 --> 00:24:53,420
Here we are.

00:24:53,487 --> 00:24:56,056
Oh, Natalie.

00:24:56,123 --> 00:24:58,626
Yeah, shy as anything
until I tried to do her laundry

00:24:58,692 --> 00:25:00,261
and then she screamed
her little head off.

00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:01,629
Do you use bleach,
Mrs. Wetzel?

00:25:01,695 --> 00:25:04,832
Have you ever even seen
a load of kids' laundry?

00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:06,634
Of course I use bleach.

00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,369
Excuse me a second.

00:25:09,837 --> 00:25:11,172
According to
Child Services,

00:25:11,238 --> 00:25:13,274
she only stayed
with you a week.

00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,242
Do you remember why?

00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:17,244
Yeah, a couple of nights
into her stay,

00:25:17,311 --> 00:25:19,046
she climbed up
to the top bunk

00:25:19,113 --> 00:25:20,648
and pushed another
little girl out.

00:25:20,714 --> 00:25:22,917
Of course we talked to her
about it, but she did it again

00:25:22,983 --> 00:25:25,186
the very next night,
almost broke her collarbone.

00:25:25,252 --> 00:25:28,189
So you just sent her back?

00:25:30,224 --> 00:25:33,227
After a few dozen kids,
you get real good

00:25:33,294 --> 00:25:35,663
at knowing the difference
between damaged and broken.

00:25:35,729 --> 00:25:38,833
And Natalie was broken.

00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:54,849
(low whirring)

00:26:01,755 --> 00:26:03,757
(sharp thudding)

00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,183
CATHERINE:
"Great Rainone
and His Little Bisque Doll."

00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:32,686
Oh, that looks like
the doll images from
the Miniatures.

00:26:32,753 --> 00:26:34,088
What's a bisque?

00:26:34,154 --> 00:26:36,090
Fired unglazed pottery.

00:26:36,157 --> 00:26:39,660
Her biological father
was Christopher Davis,
a ventriloquist.

00:26:39,727 --> 00:26:41,929
A grown man who sticks
his hand up the back

00:26:41,996 --> 00:26:43,831
of a doll and speaks
like a girl.

00:26:43,898 --> 00:26:45,866
Sounds healthy.

00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:47,935
I Googled him.

00:26:51,772 --> 00:26:54,275
Who's Chloe?
Natalie's younger sister.

00:26:54,341 --> 00:26:57,878
1981, she fell out of
a tree house and died.

00:26:57,945 --> 00:26:59,513
But her father's
still alive.

00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,582
And still performing.

00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,118
So how do you feel today, Chloe?

00:27:04,185 --> 00:27:05,986
(falsetto voice):
I'm not doing so good, Daddy.

00:27:06,053 --> 00:27:07,755
Well there,
what's the matter, doll face?

00:27:07,821 --> 00:27:10,558
Well, I feel like a hobo.

00:27:10,624 --> 00:27:11,859
A hobo?

00:27:11,926 --> 00:27:14,628
Now you know what that
stands for don't ya?

00:27:14,695 --> 00:27:15,996
That stands for
"homeward bound."

00:27:16,063 --> 00:27:17,832
But, I ain't got
no home, Daddy.

00:27:17,898 --> 00:27:19,266
Well now, that's silly.

00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:21,735
Chloe, everybody's got a home.
Where do you live?

00:27:21,802 --> 00:27:23,571
I live in a box.

00:27:23,637 --> 00:27:24,905
In a box?

00:27:24,972 --> 00:27:27,374

a pain in my sawdust.

So, being a performer

00:29:00,501 --> 00:29:03,571
and a parent had to have
been hard at times.

00:29:03,637 --> 00:29:05,372
Well, my folks were
in vaudeville.

00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:07,641
It wasn't hard
until my wife passed away.

00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:09,577
Natalie was

00:29:09,643 --> 00:29:13,147
six and Chloe was four.

00:29:14,181 --> 00:29:17,384
It was, um, pepper and salt.

00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:19,320
Darkness and light.

00:29:19,386 --> 00:29:22,089
Within the year, my
whole family was just...

00:29:22,156 --> 00:29:25,759
Poof. Gone.

00:29:25,826 --> 00:29:27,595
What happened?

00:29:30,631 --> 00:29:33,567
Can I tell
the story, Daddy?

00:29:33,634 --> 00:29:35,636
Sure, sweetheart.

00:29:40,674 --> 00:29:42,710
It was a sunny day in June.

00:29:42,776 --> 00:29:45,546
And my sister
who couldn't hold a tune

00:29:45,613 --> 00:29:47,481
was playing with me

00:29:47,548 --> 00:29:50,351

How did Natalie deal with it?

00:30:30,124 --> 00:30:32,293
I don't know.

00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:34,428
It was hard on both of us.

There's always something

and puts her under it?

00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,905
BROWN:
I don't get it.
What does Sara

00:36:26,972 --> 00:36:28,940
have to do with bleach?
WILLOWS:
I don't know.

00:36:29,007 --> 00:36:30,608
This just feels different.

00:36:30,675 --> 00:36:32,410
It is different.

00:36:43,655 --> 00:36:46,391
This girl holds me responsible

00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:48,326
for the death
of Ernie Dell.

00:36:48,393 --> 00:36:51,329
I took away the only person
she ever loved,

00:36:51,396 --> 00:36:54,165
so she's going
to do the same thing to me.

00:36:57,869 --> 00:36:59,270
GRISSOM:
It's not about
a psychotic

00:36:59,337 --> 00:37:02,140
reaction to bleach,
or some dead sister

00:37:02,207 --> 00:37:04,209
or the doll.

00:37:06,578 --> 00:37:08,546
"NotUrLittleBisqueDoll..."

00:37:21,192 --> 00:37:24,329
(typing,
computer trilling)

00:37:28,433 --> 00:37:30,101
(beep)

00:37:30,168 --> 00:37:32,170
(tapping keypad)

00:37:38,443 --> 00:37:39,944
This is Gil Grissom at CSI.

00:37:40,011 --> 00:37:42,681
I need to get
an Attorney General's Waiver.

00:37:42,747 --> 00:37:44,683
MAN:
Go, go, go!

00:37:44,749 --> 00:37:46,885
Move, move!

00:37:48,853 --> 00:37:51,489
She went out
the window!

00:37:51,556 --> 00:37:53,625
She's headed for the alley.

BRASS: I don't want
to waste time

00:39:11,236 --> 00:39:13,538
screwing around
with this nutcase.

00:39:13,605 --> 00:39:16,408
I'm going to get some
bleach and drip it on her

00:39:16,474 --> 00:39:18,543
until she gives
up the location.

00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:21,346
And they can't accuse us
of police brutality for that.

00:39:21,413 --> 00:39:23,949
I want to talk
to her, Jim.

00:39:24,015 --> 00:39:25,984
Alone.

00:39:26,051 --> 00:39:29,254
Hi, Natalie.

00:39:30,689 --> 00:39:32,324
My name's Gil.

00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:35,627
It's so nice
to finally meet you.

00:39:37,896 --> 00:39:39,864
I, uh...

00:39:39,931 --> 00:39:41,900
probably shouldn't
say this,

00:39:41,967 --> 00:39:44,836
but... I'm
a huge fan.

00:39:46,938 --> 00:39:49,841
I've been a crime scene
investigator for 22 years.

00:39:49,908 --> 00:39:52,077
I've worked over
2,000 homicides,

00:39:52,143 --> 00:39:54,779
and you are by far...

00:39:54,846 --> 00:39:58,083
the best I've ever seen.

00:39:58,149 --> 00:40:00,151
I mean...

00:40:03,755 --> 00:40:05,757
...you're such a
great artist.

00:40:07,459 --> 00:40:10,061
And to be so young
and so talented and...

00:40:10,128 --> 00:40:12,464
so pretty.

00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:15,533
I've thought about
you every night for
the last nine months.

00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,636
I even tried to do
what you do.

00:40:17,702 --> 00:40:22,140
I built my own
miniature.

00:40:22,207 --> 00:40:23,508
You saw it?

00:40:23,575 --> 00:40:26,878
How'd I do?

00:40:28,947 --> 00:40:30,882
Do you play chess?

00:40:30,949 --> 00:40:34,486
I play as a hobby.

00:40:34,552 --> 00:40:36,354
It quiets my mind, you know?

00:40:36,421 --> 00:40:37,856
Soothes me.

00:40:37,922 --> 00:40:41,393
At one point,
I became so consumed by it

00:40:41,459 --> 00:40:43,261
that whenever I closed my eyes,

00:40:43,328 --> 00:40:46,131
I could see the chess pieces
moving all around the board.

00:40:46,197 --> 00:40:48,166
I was obsessed

00:40:48,233 --> 00:40:50,302
with correcting
all my bad moves.

00:40:50,368 --> 00:40:54,506
I wondered if a game
could ever be played

00:40:54,572 --> 00:40:56,541
without a mistake.

00:40:56,608 --> 00:40:59,577
I'd love to play
you sometime.

00:40:59,644 --> 00:41:01,680
I'm so impressed

00:41:01,746 --> 00:41:03,782
by the way
you embrace your passion.

00:41:03,848 --> 00:41:06,151
You'd make a great CSI.

00:41:06,217 --> 00:41:09,487
This last one
was brilliant.

00:41:09,554 --> 00:41:12,657
You studied our
crime scene so well.

00:41:12,724 --> 00:41:13,925
Tracking the car to the junkyard

00:41:13,992 --> 00:41:15,961
and then towing it
all the way out to the desert

00:41:16,027 --> 00:41:17,295
where you knew
we wouldn't find it.

00:41:19,965 --> 00:41:21,666
And then...

00:41:21,733 --> 00:41:23,668
the way you killed Sara.

00:41:23,735 --> 00:41:25,737
(quiet gasp)

00:41:26,972 --> 00:41:29,240
I didn't kill her.

00:41:30,275 --> 00:41:32,844
You didn't?

00:41:41,586 --> 00:41:44,255
This is about her.

00:41:45,757 --> 00:41:48,259
Her, her, her!

00:41:48,326 --> 00:41:50,428
It's always about her.

00:41:50,495 --> 00:41:51,563
No, it isn't, Natalie.

00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,264
It's about you.
It's always
about her.

00:41:53,331 --> 00:41:54,899
(Natalie panting)

00:41:54,966 --> 00:41:56,534
(both grunt)

00:41:59,804 --> 00:42:01,272
(gasping)

00:42:03,408 --> 00:42:05,377
"Oh, sad

00:42:05,443 --> 00:42:08,380
"was the day
for the little bisque doll,

00:42:08,446 --> 00:42:11,016
"for they cut
all her stitches away,

00:42:11,082 --> 00:42:14,019
"and found the seat

T'was a delicate task..."

00:42:16,821 --> 00:42:18,923
Natalie, listen to me--
tell me where she is.

00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:20,925
"For none of the doctors
had ever before

00:42:20,992 --> 00:42:22,694
Natalie...
...performed
on a dolly's inside."

00:42:22,761 --> 00:42:24,429
Please tell me
where Sara is.

00:42:24,496 --> 00:42:26,498
"They tried to restuff her

00:42:26,564 --> 00:42:29,634
"but didn't know how,

her wail as she died..."

00:42:31,336 --> 00:42:32,737
Stop it! Just stop this!

00:42:32,804 --> 00:42:34,072
Tell me where Sara is!

00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:38,777
"I've got a pain in my sawdust.

"I'm just as sick

"Don't let me faint.

"Someone get me a fan.
