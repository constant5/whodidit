BRASS:
Construction
crew found him

00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:14,600
when they came
into work this morning.

00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:17,436
The woman's dead.
The guy's still alive,
but he's not talking.

00:01:17,503 --> 00:01:21,640
Wouldn't even give me
his name, even after
I gave him my name.

00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,642
GRISSOM:
Did you, uh, pull his wallet?

00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,644
No, everything is just
the way I found it.

00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,147
I mean, I figure some
knucklehead, you know,

00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,182
came in off the street,
found him,

00:01:30,249 --> 00:01:34,019
figured he had a free pass,
and picked his pocket.

00:01:34,086 --> 00:01:38,190
(Willows and Brass laughing)

00:01:38,257 --> 00:01:40,092
Anyway, I'm, uh...
I'm talking to people.

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,928
I'll, uh, I'll let you know
what we find out.

00:01:42,995 --> 00:01:44,329
GRISSOM:
Catherine...

00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:45,998
Do you need a minute?

00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,033
(laughing):
Yes, I'm...

00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,535
Yes, I'm... (clears throat)

00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:54,306

No, Gil. I'm good.

00:01:55,808 --> 00:01:58,177
So, how's
your day going?

00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,279
(chuckling)
Lady...

00:02:00,345 --> 00:02:02,915
the best day I ever had is worse

00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:04,883
than the worst day
you've ever imagined.

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,819
Oh, I doubt that.

00:02:06,885 --> 00:02:08,987
Who's your lady friend?

00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:14,159
Never saw that woman before
in my life.

00:02:14,226 --> 00:02:16,495
Uh, look, you're
not going anywhere.

00:02:16,562 --> 00:02:19,164
It'll be a lot better for
you if you just cooperate

00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:21,166
and tell us what happened.

00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:24,736
You want to know
what happened?

00:02:24,803 --> 00:02:26,538
Mm-hmm.

00:02:28,073 --> 00:02:30,042
Figure it out yourself.

00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:32,811

00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:31,839
CURTIS:
One of the residents reported
smelling a gas leak at 6:00 a.m.

00:03:31,905 --> 00:03:33,373
He, uh, called the gas company.

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,142
They arrived;
they evacuated the building.

00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:37,211
I'm surprised anyone
picked out a gas leak

00:03:37,277 --> 00:03:39,213
through the rest
of the stench around here.

00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:40,614
Yeah, smells like
used diapers.

00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:44,818
The gas boys traced the leak
to this apartment,

00:03:44,885 --> 00:03:48,889
and that was when they found...

00:03:48,956 --> 00:03:50,424
this.

00:03:50,491 --> 00:03:52,826
Whoa.

00:03:56,263 --> 00:03:59,066
Alyona Ivanovna.

00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:02,436
Manager said she's lived here
alone for 27 years.

00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:04,438
Head in the oven...

00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:06,073
It's kind of a classic, huh?

00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,307
BROWN:
Maybe not.

00:04:07,374 --> 00:04:10,010
I mean, this apartment
is neat as a pin.

00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:13,247
A lady this tidy

00:04:13,313 --> 00:04:17,718
wouldn't leave a broken dish
in a rack like that, you know?

00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:20,120
It doesn't necessarily indicate
foul play.

00:04:20,187 --> 00:04:22,523
I checked the doors
and the window.

00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:24,425
There's no sign
of forced entry.

00:04:24,491 --> 00:04:26,393
What do you make of this?

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,995
A busted phone...

00:04:28,062 --> 00:04:30,097
with gray hairs in it.

00:04:30,164 --> 00:04:34,134
She's definitely got
gray hair.

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,306
(hammering)

00:04:39,373 --> 00:04:41,308
(construction workers shouting
indistinctly)

00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:06,433
Single stab wound,
just below the sternum.

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,735
It feels domestic.

00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:09,103
Crime of passion?

00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:10,270
Him?

00:05:10,337 --> 00:05:12,873
PHILLIPS:
Good point.

00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,942

Hey! Hey!

00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:29,356
(jackhammer stops)

00:05:29,423 --> 00:05:31,692
You ready to give me a name?

00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:37,331
You know, you are
in a very deep hole,

00:05:37,398 --> 00:05:39,633
in every sense
of the word, my friend.

00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,602
Think about that
while we chisel you out.

00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:43,303
It's going to take
a few hours...

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,938
assuming we're careful.

00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:46,774
See ya.

00:05:47,808 --> 00:05:51,845
(clattering resumes)

00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:04,725
It's just a guess,
but I'd say she's in rigor.

00:06:06,727 --> 00:06:08,729
PHILLIPS:
Blunt-force trauma
on the forehead,

00:06:08,796 --> 00:06:11,532
and on the base of the skull.

00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:15,769
I doubt very highly
that those were self-induced.

00:06:15,836 --> 00:06:18,806
Look at that:
it's dented.

00:06:21,642 --> 00:06:24,378
Looks like she may have been
slammed into her own oven.

00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:26,547
Yep.

00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:28,949
PHILLIPS:
She's been dead
at least 12 hours.

00:06:30,584 --> 00:06:33,854
I've got a substance
on her... right ear.

00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:35,989
She doesn't really look like
the hair gel type.

00:06:37,257 --> 00:06:40,127
Hang on a second, fellas.
Look at that.

00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:50,738
Her dentures...

00:06:50,804 --> 00:06:53,073
they were in upside down.

00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,810
Hey. You're coming with me.

00:06:56,877 --> 00:06:58,979
We got another 419
out by Nellis.

00:06:59,046 --> 00:07:01,415
Wow, busy night.
Any details?

00:07:01,482 --> 00:07:03,650
They tell me it tastes
just like chicken.

00:07:03,717 --> 00:07:05,452

00:07:27,374 --> 00:07:30,978
BRASS:
The dead guy in the bath
is Raymundo Suarez.

00:07:31,044 --> 00:07:32,513
He works the night shift.

00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:35,315
He cleans the equipment
from 8:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m.

00:07:35,382 --> 00:07:37,918
The day-shift guys came in,
found him like this.

00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:40,587
The foreman here
called it in.

00:07:40,654 --> 00:07:43,824
This basin is designed to
transfer an electrical current.

00:07:43,891 --> 00:07:46,360
Of course it does.
It's a stun bath.

00:07:46,427 --> 00:07:47,861
We use it to stun
the chickens

00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:49,363
before they go
into the next room.

00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,432
Where they get
their throats cut.

00:07:51,498 --> 00:07:53,467
Which is why
we electrocute them first.

00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:55,169
It's humane.

00:07:55,235 --> 00:07:58,138
SANDERS:
Was the current on
when you found the body?

00:07:58,205 --> 00:08:00,641
No, sir, it was off;
it stays off all night.

00:08:00,707 --> 00:08:03,210
FOREMAN:
Hey, uh, how long
is this gonna take?

00:08:03,277 --> 00:08:05,012
As long as it takes.

00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,847
I got a lot of birds piling up
outside.

00:08:06,914 --> 00:08:08,715
They're gonna die
out there in that heat.

00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:11,552
BRASS:
Well, it's not like they're
gonna do any better in here.

00:08:11,618 --> 00:08:14,755
Come on, I want
to talk to your crew.

00:08:16,723 --> 00:08:18,392
Maybe he was high.

00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:20,794
Passes out and falls in?

00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:24,331
How does he end up face down
in the middle of the bath?

00:08:24,398 --> 00:08:27,668
Kind of tough to drown
in three inches of water.

00:08:27,735 --> 00:08:29,002
Not impossible, though.

00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:31,839
<i>If he hit the water</i>
<i>when the current was on,</i>

00:08:31,905 --> 00:08:33,407
<i>his muscles could've</i>
<i>contracted,</i>

00:08:33,474 --> 00:08:35,309
<i>making it impossible for him</i>
<i>to get out.</i>

00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,844
SANDERS:
<i>But the machine's off at night,</i>

00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,346
<i>and it was off</i>
<i>when they found the body.</i>

00:08:39,413 --> 00:08:43,817
Which means someone turned it
off after he was dead.

00:08:43,884 --> 00:08:45,853
Yeah.

00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,588
Who?

00:08:47,654 --> 00:08:49,990

All right, what's your name,
and what do you do here?

00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,898
Name's Ernie Dell.
Maintenance man.

00:08:57,965 --> 00:08:59,466
I work 3:00 to 11:00.

00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:00,534
Mm-hmm.

00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:02,369
You see the victim
last night?

00:09:02,436 --> 00:09:06,206
Uh, yeah, and Raymundo
was just fine when I left.

00:09:06,273 --> 00:09:09,076
You and Raymundo
get along?

00:09:09,143 --> 00:09:11,278
Kept my nose
out of his business;

00:09:11,345 --> 00:09:13,013
he kept his out of mine.

00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,782
Didn't have a problem with him.

00:09:14,848 --> 00:09:16,383
But you know somebody who did?

00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,453
Well, between you and me,

00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,689
the guy you ought to be talking
to is Ike Mannleigh.

00:09:22,756 --> 00:09:25,025
Oh. You mean the guy
who owns the company?

00:09:25,092 --> 00:09:26,860
Well, Raymundo's pretty far down
on the pecking order.

00:09:26,927 --> 00:09:29,129
You think the big boss
had a problem with him?

00:09:29,196 --> 00:09:30,531
No. Not unless you think

00:09:30,597 --> 00:09:33,434
a guy banging your wife
is a problem.

00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,469
(erotic moaning)

00:09:35,536 --> 00:09:37,905

00:09:37,971 --> 00:09:41,341
(woman moaning)

00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:44,445
Can't blame him, though.

00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:46,847
Bubbles Mannleigh is
a cheap whore.

00:09:46,914 --> 00:09:48,615
Did you and Bubbles
take a tumble?

00:09:48,682 --> 00:09:51,285
Me? Nah.

00:09:51,351 --> 00:09:53,253
Reminds me too much
of my mother.

00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,988
Besides, uh...

00:09:55,055 --> 00:09:58,325
Bubbles likes the dark meat.

00:09:58,392 --> 00:10:01,228
(camera shutter clicking)

00:10:18,145 --> 00:10:21,115
Unappetizing place to get
your rocks off.

00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:23,984
Not if you have
a poultry fetish.

00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:44,505
You got something?

00:10:45,773 --> 00:10:47,674
Yeah, I think so.

00:10:50,744 --> 00:10:53,514

the prize at the bottom
of a Cracker Jacks box.

00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:52,355
Definitely some kind of doll.

00:12:52,422 --> 00:12:53,456

Yeah, well, with the

calls are a match to the numbers

00:13:39,603 --> 00:13:41,371

00:13:41,438 --> 00:13:42,872
Whatever happened
with that number

00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:44,341

the disposable cell phone?

00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,342

where the phone was sold.

00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:54,384

00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:56,653

00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:17,874
cruelty.

00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:20,710
Did you know that every day
in the United States,

00:19:20,777 --> 00:19:22,545
more chickens are killed

00:19:22,612 --> 00:19:25,815

in the Rwandan genocide?

"Izzy, African people
are not a food source."

00:19:31,187 --> 00:19:33,490
Well, you're missing

Cruelty is cruelty,

00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,464

00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:51,041
As it turns out,
three years ago,

00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,143
Izzy Delancy had
a midlife awakening

00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:54,544
and became
an animal rights activist.

of everything that is wrong

in the slaughter industry.

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,691

00:20:24,908 --> 00:20:27,177
Our undercover investigators
secretly recorded

workers at a Mannleigh

dropped 60%.

00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:45,662
He launched
a very expensive PR campaign

00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:47,230

00:20:47,297 --> 00:20:49,566
