Oh... all right.

Daddy, no leave.
Daddy, no leave.

Mr. Chen works here
alone with his wife,

00:05:19,356 --> 00:05:20,991

I'm not even

that it's their second,
but what I did gather

00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:27,331
is that the steam machines
are very noisy,

00:05:27,397 --> 00:05:30,000

really heard anything.

Well, I was.

My twin died in utero.

00:09:25,803 --> 00:09:28,472
My mother didn't tell me
about it until I was an adult.

00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:30,808
When I decided
to become a coroner,

00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:32,309
she blamed herself.

00:09:32,376 --> 00:09:34,478
She said it was
because I'd spent so many days

00:09:34,545 --> 00:09:36,313
living next to a dead body.

00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,450
Well, speaking of
dead bodies, uh...
Right.

00:09:39,516 --> 00:09:42,453
Right. Jill has petechia
around the eyes,

00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,922
bruising around the neck,
and a broken clavicle.

00:09:44,988 --> 00:09:46,623
All consistent
with a hanging.

00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,294
And I extracted these
from Amanda.

00:09:51,995 --> 00:09:52,930
One went straight
to the heart.

00:09:52,996 --> 00:09:54,098
The other penetrated

00:09:54,164 --> 00:09:55,132
the right lung.

00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,102
Sharp shooter or close range.

00:09:58,168 --> 00:10:00,671
Don't tell me they died
at the same moment.
Not quite.

00:10:00,738 --> 00:10:03,207
Amanda was a couple hours
ahead of her sister.

00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:34,471
Could still be two cases.

No-Such-Thing-As-Coincidence?

00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,710
Simplest hypothesis is
usually the correct one.

00:10:39,777 --> 00:10:42,479
If you hear hooves,
think horses not zebras.

00:10:42,546 --> 00:10:44,481
What would the horses
be in this case?

00:10:44,548 --> 00:10:46,150
Murder/suicide.

00:10:48,185 --> 00:10:49,486
Jill killed

00:10:49,553 --> 00:10:51,321
Amanda.

00:10:51,388 --> 00:10:52,923
Felt guilty, then
killed herself.

00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,127
And, uh, what do you got
to support that?

00:10:57,194 --> 00:10:59,830
Did you notice any
photos of Amanda

00:10:59,897 --> 00:11:01,899
or her family in Jill's house?

00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:04,001
No.
Right.

00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:05,235
And I looked through

00:11:05,302 --> 00:11:08,405
Amanda's phone book,
Jill was not even in it.

00:11:08,472 --> 00:11:10,574
Well, maybe she had
her number memorized.

00:11:10,641 --> 00:11:12,342

00:11:13,577 --> 00:11:15,179
None existed.

00:11:15,245 --> 00:11:18,682
She's leaving a small
fortune to various charities.

00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:20,551
It just sounds to me
like estrangement.

00:11:20,617 --> 00:11:22,586
Okay, even
if that's not

00:11:22,653 --> 00:11:23,754

it went down,

00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:25,089
I'll bet you a dollar

00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:26,757
that the twins
deaths are related.

00:11:26,824 --> 00:11:29,193
Two women found dead

00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:31,862
on opposite sides of town.

00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:34,198
If they didn't look alike,

00:11:34,264 --> 00:11:36,033
would you still link them?

00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,701
If they're relatives, yes.

00:11:37,768 --> 00:11:39,837
Sisters, husband and wife,

00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,740

Okay.

00:11:42,806 --> 00:11:44,341
Okay, what?

00:11:44,408 --> 00:11:46,276
I'll take the bet.

00:11:48,412 --> 00:11:49,980
I must've called
her ten times,

00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:51,715
then after about an hour
I got so worried.

00:11:51,782 --> 00:11:53,717
Did your wife have any enemies?

00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:55,052
Anyone she was fighting with?

00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:56,220
No, she was a good wife,

00:11:56,286 --> 00:11:58,288
great mother.

00:11:58,355 --> 00:11:59,990

00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:12,569
Jill who?

00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:15,205
Her twin sister, Jill Case.

00:12:15,272 --> 00:12:17,307
Amanda didn't have a sister.

00:12:17,374 --> 00:12:19,610
DNA tells us otherwise.

00:12:19,676 --> 00:12:21,678
My wife was an only child.

00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,282
Sh-she was adopted, but...

00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:28,185
Is it possible that...

00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:30,821
your wife knew she had
a twin, but she hadn't

00:12:30,888 --> 00:12:33,357
told you?
Well, I'd like to think no.

00:12:33,424 --> 00:12:35,058
That we told
each other everything.

00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,461
But that's not...
True?

00:12:38,462 --> 00:12:40,464
A marriage.

00:12:41,598 --> 00:12:42,900
Married, Detective?

00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:44,935
No.

00:12:45,002 --> 00:12:46,437
Something weird happens
between two people

00:12:46,503 --> 00:12:48,205
who know each other for years,

00:12:48,272 --> 00:12:50,274
see each other every day.

00:12:51,775 --> 00:12:53,377
Every night I drive home
from the hospital

00:12:53,444 --> 00:12:56,113
and I think of 12 things
I want to tell Amanda.

00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,383
And then I get home
and, uh... she's cooking.

00:13:00,884 --> 00:13:03,520
And we read stories
to Henry and then...

00:13:03,587 --> 00:13:05,422
the phone rings, so I--
you know, you say,

00:13:05,489 --> 00:13:07,558
"Oh, I'll just tell her
tomorrow. Tomorrow."

00:13:07,624 --> 00:13:09,326
(sniffs)

00:13:09,393 --> 00:13:10,694
I'd like to meet her.

00:13:10,761 --> 00:13:13,497
Jill.

00:13:13,564 --> 00:13:16,500
I'm sorry that's...

00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:20,671
that's not possible.
We found them both...

00:13:20,738 --> 00:13:22,639
last night.

00:13:22,706 --> 00:13:24,641
What happened?

00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:28,011
Right now...

00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:30,013
we don't know.

00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,215
HENRY:
It's okay, Daddy.

00:13:31,281 --> 00:13:33,450
Let's go home
and see Mommy.

00:13:33,517 --> 00:13:35,719
Okay.

00:14:02,413 --> 00:14:04,381
(computer beeps)

00:14:22,966 --> 00:14:25,502
Hey. I got your text.

00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:26,670
What's up?

00:14:26,737 --> 00:14:28,839
Sing it, dude. This is huge.

00:14:28,906 --> 00:14:31,008
Oh...

00:14:31,075 --> 00:14:32,910
♪ Oh, Mandy ♪

00:14:32,976 --> 00:14:34,745

00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,752
(louder):

00:14:41,819 --> 00:14:45,255

♪ Oh, Mandy. ♪

00:14:53,764 --> 00:14:56,233
Okay. I got a hit off of that

00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,235
envelope you found
in Amanda's purse.

00:14:58,302 --> 00:15:00,070
It's a Dora Pomerantz.

00:15:00,137 --> 00:15:01,538
Oh, that would make sense.

00:15:01,605 --> 00:15:03,540
The letter was
signed "Dora."

00:15:03,607 --> 00:15:04,908
Do you wanna know why
she's in the system?

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,149
Mrs. Pomerantz?

00:15:12,216 --> 00:15:13,817
Who wants to know?

00:15:13,884 --> 00:15:16,487
Detective Curtis
and CSI Nick Stokes.

00:15:16,553 --> 00:15:18,989
Hi.
We just need to ask
you a few questions.

00:15:19,056 --> 00:15:20,491
About what?

00:15:20,557 --> 00:15:22,559
Your twins.

00:15:25,062 --> 00:15:27,064
That was a very
long time ago.

00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:30,400
We were just curious

00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:33,237
about the circumstances
under which they were adopted.

00:15:33,303 --> 00:15:37,941
I was 18 years old
when I got pregnant.

00:15:38,008 --> 00:15:40,778
Charlie said he'd stay with me.

00:15:40,844 --> 00:15:42,846
Then he got drafted to Vietnam.

00:15:43,981 --> 00:15:46,817
Came home six months later...
in a box.

00:15:48,652 --> 00:15:50,521
These two chirping birds.

00:15:50,587 --> 00:15:52,189
"Waa, waa, waa."

00:15:52,256 --> 00:15:54,591
I couldn't get
them to stop.

00:15:54,658 --> 00:15:56,126
I couldn't take it.

00:15:56,193 --> 00:15:58,529
So one day I just...

00:15:58,595 --> 00:16:00,531
Boop... snapped.

00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:05,369
That was it. No more babies.

00:16:05,436 --> 00:16:08,772
I spent ten years
in a state facility, you know?

00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:11,041
We were aware.

00:16:11,108 --> 00:16:13,143
How have you
been since?

00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,479
Oh... fine.

00:16:15,546 --> 00:16:17,981
A smart doctor put me
in touch with an equine

00:16:18,048 --> 00:16:19,950
assisted
therapy program.

00:16:20,017 --> 00:16:22,586
Saved my life.

00:16:22,653 --> 00:16:25,155
Horses don't have judgments.

00:16:25,222 --> 00:16:27,724
They have needs. Meet the
needs, the horse is happy.

00:16:31,328 --> 00:16:33,030
Helped retrain my brain.

00:16:33,097 --> 00:16:35,365
Healthy enough to get back
in touch with your daughters?

00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:40,170
Oh, no. Uh...

00:16:40,237 --> 00:16:42,172
not recommended.

00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,508
Sometimes you just
can't go back.

00:16:44,575 --> 00:16:47,511
Is that why you wrote
Amanda this letter saying,

00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:50,180
"Please do not ever
contact me again?"

00:16:50,247 --> 00:16:51,515
Who's Amanda?

00:16:52,983 --> 00:16:54,518
One of your daughters.

00:16:54,585 --> 00:16:56,754
We keep envelopes loose
in a desk drawer.

00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,555
I must've touched it
before she sent it.

00:16:58,622 --> 00:17:01,058
Who?
The handwriting, it's Tiffany's.

00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:04,261
I'm sorry. Who's Tiffany?

00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:08,298
I had no idea my mom
had given up a kid.

00:17:08,365 --> 00:17:10,467
But I did know
that there was no way

00:17:10,534 --> 00:17:12,970
she could handle
dealing with it.

00:17:13,036 --> 00:17:15,706
So... you always go
through your mom's mail?

00:17:15,773 --> 00:17:19,309
Yeah. My dad and I
have a system.

00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:21,378
We screen all her mail.

00:17:21,445 --> 00:17:23,380
Why's that?

00:17:23,447 --> 00:17:24,748
She's got
this problem.

00:17:24,815 --> 00:17:28,185
Any time a children's charity
solicitation comes,

00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:30,554
she donates
and not just a little.

00:17:30,621 --> 00:17:32,423
Half my college fund was gone

00:17:32,489 --> 00:17:34,391
before we realized
what was going on.

00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,894
So you thought Amanda
had her hand out?

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,962
Wasn't worth the risk.

00:17:41,064 --> 00:17:43,200
The anti-depressants
and the horses help,

00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:46,904
but my mom's barely hanging on.

00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,306
And I only have
a year left before
I go to college.

00:17:49,373 --> 00:17:52,676
I just need her
to hang on one more year.

00:17:52,743 --> 00:17:55,546
So, I sent the polite response
and hoped it was over.

00:17:55,612 --> 00:17:58,715
Did Jill ever try
to contact your mom?

00:17:58,782 --> 00:17:59,983
Who's Jill?

00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,144
SIMMS:
<i>So I got bad news</i>
<i>and weird news.</i>

00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,846
Which would you
like to hear first?

00:18:08,912 --> 00:18:10,347
Bad.
Bad news:

00:18:10,414 --> 00:18:11,782
I got nothing from
the blue stocking

00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:13,083
that was found in the trash.

00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,085
Weird news: I tested
the red lipstick

00:18:15,152 --> 00:18:16,520
on Gary Sinclair's collar

00:18:16,587 --> 00:18:20,290
and I got DNA, but
it wasn't his wife's.

00:18:20,357 --> 00:18:22,459
Well, based on
the contents of her
purse, she's more

00:18:22,526 --> 00:18:23,961
the lip balm type.

00:18:24,027 --> 00:18:25,362
You know I like to be thorough,

00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:26,964
so... I ran it through CODIS

00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:30,200
and I actually got a hit:
Natal Peled.

00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:32,836
She's in the system
from a rape charge in L.A.

00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,738
They don't put victim's
DNA in the database.

00:18:34,805 --> 00:18:35,973
No, they don't.

00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:37,875
Yeah, I had to know,

00:18:37,941 --> 00:18:39,843
so I called a friend of mine
at L.A. Sheriff's Department,

00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,813
and apparently, Natal was
a nurse at a Hollywood hospital.

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,381
And she went to the annual
Christmas party,

00:18:44,448 --> 00:18:45,516
she fed this doctor a bunch

00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,885
of cocktails,
slipped him a Viagra,

00:18:47,951 --> 00:18:49,753
and then took him
up to a hotel room.

00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,455
And rumor has it,
it was in order to have

00:18:51,522 --> 00:18:54,558
unprotected, you know...
baby-making sex.

00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,227
So he pressed charges,
she was arrested,

00:18:57,294 --> 00:18:58,762
and then they settled
out of court.

00:18:58,829 --> 00:19:01,498
And now Natal's a nurse
at our very own Dessert Palm.

00:19:01,565 --> 00:19:03,667
With Amanda's husband,

00:19:03,734 --> 00:19:06,170
Dr. Gary Sinclair.

00:19:06,236 --> 00:19:08,005
Doctors have a name
for what Natal is.

00:19:08,071 --> 00:19:09,573
What she is?

00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,941
A woman who trolls
hospitals looking

00:19:11,008 --> 00:19:12,776
to land themselves a doctor.

00:19:12,843 --> 00:19:14,011
Call them bedpans:

00:19:14,077 --> 00:19:16,680
shiny, full of crap,
and... best when dumped.

00:19:16,747 --> 00:19:18,282
NATAL:
<i>Of course we slept together.</i>

00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,118
Who wouldn't want
to get with this?

00:19:22,486 --> 00:19:23,587
Of course he's
gonna deny it

00:19:23,654 --> 00:19:25,456
because of that
little wife of his.

00:19:25,522 --> 00:19:27,624
So you met his wife, Amanda?

00:19:27,691 --> 00:19:30,461
Please. Yes, I've met her.

00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:33,096
Always coming
by the hospital,
check up on him.

00:19:33,163 --> 00:19:34,465
Talk about paranoid.

00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:36,767
Hey, with you around...

00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:38,268
sounds like she had
pretty good reason.

00:19:38,335 --> 00:19:40,504
Mr. Stokes...

00:19:41,538 --> 00:19:43,207
men are like tigers--

00:19:43,273 --> 00:19:45,042
if you can't tame them,

00:19:45,108 --> 00:19:47,110
you must let
them roam free.

00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:50,447
I go now, yeah?

00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:03,460
Yes. It seems that
the paint on the Sabra's key

00:20:03,527 --> 00:20:05,729
is consistent
with Lexus factory issue.

00:20:05,796 --> 00:20:08,732
Color's Galactic Grey
Mica IE9.

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,967
Same as Amanda's.

00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:14,738
So... crazy chick
keys the wife's car.

00:20:14,805 --> 00:20:16,874
Is it gateway violence
that led to murder,

00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,475
or just another coincidence

00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:20,110
like everything else
in this case?

00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,379
I almost keyed
a car once.

00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:25,916
You what?

00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,519
I know, but, in the
end, I couldn't go
through with it.

00:20:31,989 --> 00:20:34,458
So I peed on the
door handles instead.

00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:37,961
So they'd freeze up
and can't get them open?

00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:41,598
No. It was San Diego.

00:20:41,665 --> 00:20:43,834
Over a girl?

00:20:43,901 --> 00:20:46,570
Over a "B."

00:20:46,637 --> 00:20:48,305
Professor gave me
one on my term paper.

00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,706
I felt I deserved an "A".

00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,612
So she definitely
keyed the car,

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,048
and may or may not have
been doing the husband.

00:20:58,115 --> 00:20:59,449
I'm going with yes.

00:20:59,516 --> 00:21:02,553
Ballistics came back on the
bullets that killed Amanda.

00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:05,389
There's only one gun with a
six right polygonal barrel

00:21:05,456 --> 00:21:07,057
that comes in a .41 caliber:

00:21:07,124 --> 00:21:09,526
A Baby Eagle--
Israeli military issue.

00:21:09,593 --> 00:21:12,563
Israeli guns
are really hard to find.

00:21:12,629 --> 00:21:15,866
Unless you served in the
Israeli army like Natal.

00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:18,802
Okay. Okay, I certainly
wouldn't put it past her,

00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:20,804
but what about the husband?

00:21:20,871 --> 00:21:22,206
Classic "he said, she said."

00:21:22,272 --> 00:21:23,574
They're either acting

00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,543
in cahoots, trying to
confuse us, or Natal

00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,146
is acting on her own,
thinking that the wife

00:21:29,213 --> 00:21:30,814
is the obstacle
standing between them.

00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:33,584
Nothing quite says
"I love you" like,

00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,519
"I killed your wife
so we can be together."

00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,754
Sir, we have a warrant
to search the premises,

00:21:37,821 --> 00:21:39,823
and we need you
to come down to the station.

00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,992
If you can't make arrangements
for your child,

00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:44,695
we have a Child Services
Advocate who can take him.

00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:45,729
This is ridiculous.

00:21:45,796 --> 00:21:46,897
I've been nothing
but cooperative.

00:21:46,964 --> 00:21:48,732
You harass me at
my place of work.

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,134
You harass me at my home.

00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,768
Now you want
to take my kid away?

00:21:51,835 --> 00:21:54,037
Sir, are you resisting?

00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,273
I didn't kill my wife.

00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,242
I was giving my son a bath.

00:21:58,308 --> 00:21:59,476
I couldn't have done it.

00:22:02,412 --> 00:22:06,083
Can I at least put my shoes on?

00:22:34,611 --> 00:22:36,113
(car alarm chirps)

00:22:37,281 --> 00:22:41,585
(song plays on radio)

00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,187
(engine starts)

00:22:51,562 --> 00:22:52,930
What have you got?

00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,432
A smoking gun.

00:22:58,302 --> 00:23:00,737
You're not going
to like the answer.

00:23:00,804 --> 00:23:03,774
The DNA on the cigarette
butts doesn't match Natal.

00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:05,209
Come on.

00:23:05,275 --> 00:23:07,511
You can't tell me we're back
to square one on this deal.

00:23:07,578 --> 00:23:08,812
Well, we're not.

00:23:08,879 --> 00:23:10,714
DNA was female,
so I ran it against Amanda,

00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:11,815
thinking, I don't know,

00:23:11,882 --> 00:23:13,750
maybe she takes super-secret
cigarette breaks.

00:23:13,817 --> 00:23:17,154
And it wasn't a match, but they
do have seven loci in common.

00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:19,223
So, is there
another sister maybe?

00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,760
Tiffany.

00:23:23,827 --> 00:23:26,330
I'm confused.

00:23:26,396 --> 00:23:28,132
This is 'cause I was smoking?

00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,468
Well, no, smoking
is bad for you,

00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,538
but, no, this is really more
about where you were smoking.

00:23:34,605 --> 00:23:38,575
I'm an only child who
lives on a horse farm

00:23:38,642 --> 00:23:40,310
in the middle
of nowhere

00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,379
with a horse-
whispering mother

00:23:42,446 --> 00:23:44,948
and a dad who works all
the time to avoid her.

00:23:45,015 --> 00:23:48,152
When Amanda's
letter came...

00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,754
I was so excited

00:23:50,821 --> 00:23:54,057
at the idea of
having a sister.

00:23:54,124 --> 00:23:56,393
I was jumping
out of my skin.

00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,030
So I told my mom I
joined cheerleading.

00:24:00,097 --> 00:24:03,500
And after school,
I would...

00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,469
You'd what?

00:24:05,536 --> 00:24:08,505
It started where I
would just drive by.

00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,408
And then it escalated?

00:24:11,475 --> 00:24:14,878
Well...

00:24:14,945 --> 00:24:16,413
once, I saw her
in the yard,

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,482
playing with
her little boy.

00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:21,552
So I started
parking out front.

00:24:24,054 --> 00:24:25,489
Hoping to see
her again.

00:24:25,556 --> 00:24:29,593
<i>Basically, I would</i>
<i>just sit there,</i>

00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,094
<i>imagining her in my life.</i>

00:24:31,161 --> 00:24:32,763
<i>She'd make me tea.</i>

00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,733
<i>And we'd go over</i>
<i>my college applications</i>

00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,435
<i>and talk about boys.</i>

00:24:38,502 --> 00:24:41,672
It was like a TV commercial.

00:24:41,738 --> 00:24:42,906
And then what?

00:24:42,973 --> 00:24:45,509
Did your...

00:24:45,576 --> 00:24:47,744
curiosity...

00:24:47,811 --> 00:24:49,046
become an obsession?

00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:52,749
Oh, my God.

00:24:52,816 --> 00:24:54,885
No.

00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,353
I could barely
get up the courage

00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,856
to introduce myself.

00:24:58,922 --> 00:25:01,959
That's why I'd just
sit there smoking.

00:25:02,025 --> 00:25:05,028
And then my stomach would hurt,
so I would just drive home.

00:25:08,098 --> 00:25:09,666
And now, I'll never
get the chance.

Hey, Grissom said
you might need some help.

What?

00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,358
I don't know, you don't look

00:26:46,425 --> 00:26:47,826

00:26:47,893 --> 00:26:49,028
Well, I guess

00:26:49,094 --> 00:26:50,296
the inquest was the easy part.

00:26:50,362 --> 00:26:52,598
Now the kid's family

00:26:52,665 --> 00:26:54,033
Know any good lawyers?

00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:56,135
I hate lawyers.

00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:58,737
Sure.

00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,648
I found her naughty drawer.

00:27:09,715 --> 00:27:11,317
My favorite part
of any bedroom search.

00:27:11,383 --> 00:27:14,486
I don't believe
these girls anymore.

00:27:19,592 --> 00:27:22,795
Looks like someone's been
elevated to drawer status.

00:27:22,861 --> 00:27:26,031
Well, apparently,
love can't cure all that ails.

00:27:26,098 --> 00:27:30,436
Alprazolam, clonazepam,
diazepam and sertraline--

00:27:30,502 --> 00:27:32,338
all in her medicine cabinet.

00:27:32,404 --> 00:27:36,375
Well, I said dude had a drawer,
I didn't say it was love.

00:27:36,442 --> 00:27:39,645
HOFFMAN:
<i>She had OCD-related depression,</i>
<i>which is</i>

00:27:39,712 --> 00:27:42,448
very deceiving
because the sufferers

00:27:42,514 --> 00:27:43,816
are high functioning.

00:27:43,882 --> 00:27:45,884
It's not your usual, you know,
"lie on the couch

00:27:45,951 --> 00:27:47,686
and listen to the Beatles"
kind of depression.

00:27:47,753 --> 00:27:49,054
Did she ever talk about family?

00:27:49,121 --> 00:27:50,322
You know,
when a patient dies,

00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:52,791
the doctor-patient
confidentiality clause is void.

00:27:52,858 --> 00:27:54,860
But I'm just sort of feeling
a little uncomfortable.

00:27:54,927 --> 00:27:56,962
Do I have to...

00:27:57,029 --> 00:27:58,430
call a lawyer?

00:27:58,497 --> 00:28:01,000
It's entirely your choice.

00:28:01,066 --> 00:28:03,335
We can subpoena
her records,

00:28:03,402 --> 00:28:05,337
or you and I can talk.

00:28:05,404 --> 00:28:07,306
Okay.

00:28:07,373 --> 00:28:08,574
All she would say was

00:28:08,641 --> 00:28:10,209
that she didn't get along
with her parents,

00:28:10,276 --> 00:28:11,810
and that, um, you know,

00:28:11,877 --> 00:28:13,279
relationships in general
were difficult.

00:28:13,345 --> 00:28:16,081
I mean,
her condition made her

00:28:16,148 --> 00:28:18,250
excel professionally
but flop personally.

00:28:18,317 --> 00:28:22,121
We, uh, checked
her records.

00:28:22,187 --> 00:28:24,790
She was adopted as an infant.

00:28:24,857 --> 00:28:26,992
Her parents never told her.

00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:28,260
Huh.

00:28:28,327 --> 00:28:32,131
Well, that explains her
abandonment-attachment issues,

00:28:32,197 --> 00:28:35,434
and why she always felt like
a square peg in a round family.

00:28:35,501 --> 00:28:37,269
Did you believe
she was suicidal?

00:28:37,336 --> 00:28:39,138
Off the record, no, I don't.
I don't think

00:28:39,204 --> 00:28:40,239
she was suicidal, I thought,

00:28:40,306 --> 00:28:41,540
I actually thought
she was getting better.

00:28:41,607 --> 00:28:45,411
So then how does
an attractive, successful

00:28:45,477 --> 00:28:48,147
36-year-old woman hang herself
from her own balcony?

00:28:48,213 --> 00:28:49,748
'Cause the choice was there.

00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:52,551
<i>At the end of the day, when</i>
<i>an obsessive brain is presented</i>

00:28:52,618 --> 00:28:53,719

<i>it just, sometimes,</i>
<i>it just can't shut off</i>

00:28:55,554 --> 00:28:57,623
<i>the clatter of the idea</i>

00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,725
<i>until it sees it through</i>
<i>to conclusion.</i>

00:28:59,792 --> 00:29:01,594
The idea found its way in.

00:29:04,229 --> 00:29:07,099
ROBBINS:
It wasn't suicide.

00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:14,740
eight on the back.

00:29:14,807 --> 00:29:16,842
Strangulation.

00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:19,878
Murder.

meeting, all the section editors

No, I've called,
I've e-mailed, I've texted.

00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,776
She'd have to be lying dead in
a ditch not to answer her phone.

00:29:50,843 --> 00:29:52,278
I know. Bye.

00:29:52,344 --> 00:29:53,445
Can I help you?

00:29:53,512 --> 00:29:55,814
I'm Detective Jim Brass,
Las Vegas Police.

00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:57,449
This is Warrick Brown
from the Crime Lab.

00:29:57,516 --> 00:30:00,286
We have a warrant to
search Jill Case's office.

00:30:00,352 --> 00:30:02,454
Okay, is she in
some kind of trouble?

00:30:02,521 --> 00:30:04,490
Well, it wasn't
a ditch.

00:30:04,556 --> 00:30:07,159
Oh, my God.

00:30:07,226 --> 00:30:08,727
I...

00:30:08,794 --> 00:30:10,329
God.

00:30:10,396 --> 00:30:11,897
What's going on?

00:30:11,964 --> 00:30:13,232
Back off. Get away.

00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:15,200
All of you, go! Go!

00:30:16,068 --> 00:30:17,569
Look, you can't drop a hot one

00:30:17,636 --> 00:30:18,804
in a room full of vultures.

00:30:18,871 --> 00:30:19,939
They smell blood.

00:30:20,005 --> 00:30:21,473
Half of them were
wanting to pry her ass

00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,875
out of that chair for months.

00:30:22,942 --> 00:30:25,210
BRASS:
I'll need a list of all
the employees who work

00:30:25,277 --> 00:30:26,545
for the paper--
can you provide that?

00:30:26,612 --> 00:30:28,147
I don't have access
to that kind of information.

00:30:28,213 --> 00:30:29,748
You're gonna have to go
down to Human Resources.

00:30:29,815 --> 00:30:31,884
Human Resources.
Okay.

00:30:31,951 --> 00:30:33,218
You're on your own.

00:30:33,285 --> 00:30:36,088
I'll be taking a look
inside her office, okay?

00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:48,701
Did Jill have a computer?

00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:50,469
Yeah, her laptop, of course.

00:30:50,536 --> 00:30:51,804
It was like an extra limb.

00:31:06,285 --> 00:31:08,187
What's with the locked drawer?

00:31:08,254 --> 00:31:09,421
That was a new thing.

00:31:09,488 --> 00:31:11,290
She's always been neurotic,
but lately she's been secretive,

00:31:11,357 --> 00:31:13,359
like sneaky-- rolling
her own calls,

00:31:13,425 --> 00:31:14,960
making her own appointments,

00:31:15,027 --> 00:31:16,762
talking with editors
from other newspapers.

00:31:16,829 --> 00:31:19,932
Honestly, I just thought
she was looking for another job.

00:31:39,952 --> 00:31:41,954
Did you ever
try to open this drawer?

00:31:42,021 --> 00:31:42,955
Are you kidding?

00:31:43,022 --> 00:31:43,989
She had the only key,

00:31:44,056 --> 00:31:46,125
and protecting her privacy
was how I kept my job.

00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,596
JOHNSON:
<i>Because Amanda's murder</i>
<i>is still unsolved,</i>

00:31:50,663 --> 00:31:52,431
I cross-checked the
twins' address books.

00:31:52,498 --> 00:31:54,033
Now, they have
no contacts in common, but...

00:31:55,467 --> 00:31:57,269
there are a couple
freaky things.

00:31:57,336 --> 00:31:59,438
So Amanda was set

00:31:59,505 --> 00:32:01,073
to pick up dry cleaning
in the morning,

00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,142
but it looks as though
she had a sick child,

00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:04,276
so she went
at night instead.

00:32:04,343 --> 00:32:05,277
JOHNSON:
Right.

00:32:05,344 --> 00:32:07,112
And if she'd gone earlier

00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:08,147
than she was supposed to,

00:32:08,213 --> 00:32:09,348
she might've
run into Jill,

00:32:09,415 --> 00:32:10,616
who was scheduled
to pick up

00:32:10,683 --> 00:32:11,984
her dry cleaning at
8:30 in the morning.

00:32:12,051 --> 00:32:13,552
But it gets better.

00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:15,621
Based on receipts
from Amanda's planner

00:32:15,688 --> 00:32:17,990
and Quicken listings
from Jill's Treo,

00:32:18,057 --> 00:32:19,925
they used the
same dry cleaner,

00:32:19,992 --> 00:32:22,328
same car dealership,
they both had a weakness

00:32:22,394 --> 00:32:24,330
for the same frozen yogurt
and blended mochas,

00:32:24,396 --> 00:32:25,764
and in two weeks,

00:32:25,831 --> 00:32:28,200
Jill was scheduled to teach
a university extension class

00:32:28,267 --> 00:32:29,735
in photography.

00:32:29,802 --> 00:32:31,670
Guess who was signed
up to take the class?

00:32:31,737 --> 00:32:34,173
Amanda.

00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:35,808
Huh.

00:32:35,874 --> 00:32:36,976
They would've finally met.

00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:39,044
WILLOWS:
So having the same

00:32:39,111 --> 00:32:41,013
toe nail polish
and watch made sense

00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,881
when we thought they knew
each other, but now?

00:32:42,948 --> 00:32:47,186
I mean, they even have almost
the same handwriting.

00:32:47,253 --> 00:32:48,687
GRISSOM:
Well, people's
first explanation

00:32:48,754 --> 00:32:50,456
with twins is always

00:32:50,522 --> 00:32:52,658
parapsychology,
but the truth is,

00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:54,526
there's a lot of biological
encoding at work.

00:32:54,593 --> 00:32:56,729
I mean, if you have
the same musculature

00:32:56,795 --> 00:33:00,699
and bone structure in your hand,
the chance of writing the same

00:33:00,766 --> 00:33:02,568
is not out of the question.

00:33:02,635 --> 00:33:04,436
If beauty is in the eye
of the beholder,

00:33:04,503 --> 00:33:06,538
and you both see
with the same eyes

00:33:06,605 --> 00:33:09,041
or taste with the same tongue...

00:33:09,108 --> 00:33:12,378
Well, I don't know
whose eyes she was using

00:33:12,444 --> 00:33:13,846
for this guy.

00:33:13,912 --> 00:33:15,247
Jill was scheduled to have
dinner at Joie de Vive

00:33:15,314 --> 00:33:17,216
on the night she died.

00:33:17,283 --> 00:33:19,652
So Warrick called over and
got the surveillance footage.

00:33:19,718 --> 00:33:21,387
I don't have an ID yet.

00:33:21,453 --> 00:33:23,856
I do.

00:33:23,923 --> 00:33:27,092
Her relationship with me was the
most intimate she's ever had.

00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:29,094
I actually felt like
we were making progress.

00:33:29,161 --> 00:33:30,496
Until the murder.

00:33:30,562 --> 00:33:31,630
What are you talking about?

00:33:31,697 --> 00:33:33,532
She committed suicide.

00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:35,000
Did I tell you that?
What are--

00:33:35,067 --> 00:33:37,236
What are you suggesting,
that I murdered my own patient?

00:33:37,303 --> 00:33:38,904
Let me run down
the sequence of events.

00:33:38,971 --> 00:33:40,873
So you took your
"girlfriend" out to dinner.

00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:44,944
<i>Then you brought her home for a</i>
<i>little tie me up, tie me down.</i>

00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,079
<i>But things get wonky</i>
<i>and in the throes of passion,</i>

00:33:47,146 --> 00:33:50,082
<i>you remembered, "Wait a minute,</i>
<i>she's a patient.</i>

00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:52,117
<i>Uh-oh."</i>

00:33:52,184 --> 00:33:54,453
<i>So she had a history</i>
<i>of depression.</i>

00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,522
<i>So you used that knowledge</i>
<i>to cover it up.</i>

00:33:56,589 --> 00:33:58,090
Well, we did go to dinner
that night,

00:33:58,157 --> 00:33:59,625
but afterwards
I dropped her off.

00:33:59,692 --> 00:34:00,926
Because she said
she had to work to do.

00:34:00,993 --> 00:34:01,927
I didn't even go inside,

00:34:01,994 --> 00:34:02,962
so I don't even understand

00:34:03,028 --> 00:34:03,996
your question.
Are you saying

00:34:04,063 --> 00:34:05,230
the two of you
never had rough sex?

00:34:05,297 --> 00:34:06,799
Now, be careful here, doctor.

00:34:12,371 --> 00:34:14,406
Yeah, It's true that,

00:34:14,473 --> 00:34:17,376
in the past, we engaged
in some, you know,

00:34:17,443 --> 00:34:20,779
some, uh, role playing sex games
to help get her comfortable,

00:34:20,846 --> 00:34:21,814
but...

00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,915
But what?

00:34:22,982 --> 00:34:26,285
She was the "S." I was the "M."

00:34:31,557 --> 00:34:32,992
Hey, um...

00:34:33,058 --> 00:34:35,527
you know, how we thought that
the shrink was a slam dunk

00:34:35,594 --> 00:34:37,296
for Jill's
strangulation-hanging-combo?

00:34:37,363 --> 00:34:39,031
Yeah.
Well, I ran his DNA

00:34:39,098 --> 00:34:40,866
against the epithelials
we found on the leash.

00:34:40,933 --> 00:34:43,636
And the epithelials are
male, but they're not his.

00:34:45,271 --> 00:34:46,772
Thanks.

00:34:49,074 --> 00:34:51,343
News on our case...
The shrink

00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:52,311
might not have done it?

00:34:52,378 --> 00:34:53,412
How did you know?

00:34:53,479 --> 00:34:54,179
Because Archie

00:34:54,246 --> 00:34:55,981
found us another
strong suspect.

00:34:56,048 --> 00:34:57,816
You know,
that flash drive

00:34:57,883 --> 00:35:00,019
that I found in the locked
drawer in Jill Case's office,

00:35:00,085 --> 00:35:01,654
I thought it was
just a bunch of

00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,922
photos but it turns out

00:35:02,988 --> 00:35:04,490
there was a little bit more
than meets the eye.

00:35:04,556 --> 00:35:06,926
You mean the flash drive
was a Transformer?

00:35:06,992 --> 00:35:08,460
No.
Well,

00:35:08,527 --> 00:35:09,862
the pictures kind of were.

00:35:09,929 --> 00:35:11,497
Check it out.

00:35:11,563 --> 00:35:13,265
Look familiar?
This got bought

00:35:13,332 --> 00:35:15,000
by the A.P.
It was on the front page

00:35:15,067 --> 00:35:16,201
of the Las Vegas <i>Globe.</i>

00:35:16,268 --> 00:35:17,603
It won a Pulitzer.

00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,672
It was everywhere.
Okay. So what?

00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:20,706
These are Jake Lenoir's

00:35:20,773 --> 00:35:23,676
photographs taken
in Iraq last summer.

00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,149
Watch this.

00:35:35,754 --> 00:35:37,056
The front page news

00:35:37,122 --> 00:35:39,124
was actually a composite?

00:35:39,191 --> 00:35:41,360
Well, it's a...
essentially an art project.

00:35:41,427 --> 00:35:43,128
And Jill printed it.

00:35:43,195 --> 00:35:45,598
I assume she didn't realize
it until it was too late.

00:35:45,664 --> 00:35:46,865
And before she died,

00:35:46,932 --> 00:35:48,334
she was trying to figure out
how to handle it.

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,135
The only thing standing
between Jake

00:35:50,202 --> 00:35:51,837
and the rest
of his career

00:35:51,904 --> 00:35:54,340
was the truth.

00:35:54,406 --> 00:35:56,075
And Jill Case.

00:35:58,165 --> 00:35:59,533
Well, must be fun to be you.

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:00,967
Got a job that

00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:04,938
takes you around the world,
get to meet some great girls,

00:36:05,005 --> 00:36:06,907
even win some awards.

00:36:06,973 --> 00:36:10,110
So why would an
adrenaline junkie

00:36:10,177 --> 00:36:13,447
like you, waste his time
with Photoshopping?

00:36:13,513 --> 00:36:18,985
Let me tell you something
that the, um... newspapers,

00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:20,620
TV stations
don't want to hear.

00:36:20,687 --> 00:36:23,223
There's nothing over there
to photograph.

00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,358
Insurgents?

00:36:25,425 --> 00:36:27,294
They fire off their
outdated weapons,

00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,395
then run the other way.

00:36:28,462 --> 00:36:30,063
When we do midnight raids
in the villages,

00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,498
you know what
the people tell us?

00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:33,567
"AliBaba not here."

00:36:33,633 --> 00:36:36,403
We are fighting
a fictional character.

00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,305
And you got thousands
of soldiers over there,

00:36:38,372 --> 00:36:39,740
kids, 18 years old,

00:36:39,806 --> 00:36:42,309
pumped up on testosterone,
full of nicotine,

00:36:42,376 --> 00:36:44,878
and caffeine, waiting for
something to bloody well happen.

00:36:44,945 --> 00:36:46,179
And you know what?

00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:49,383
You pray for a roadside bomb
because it feels like action.

00:36:49,449 --> 00:36:52,819
But you can't photograph
the taste of gasoline.

00:36:52,886 --> 00:36:54,354
It just looks like smoke.

00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:56,590
So one day, yeah,

00:36:56,656 --> 00:36:57,958
I'm screwing around
on my computer.

00:36:58,024 --> 00:37:00,427
Couple of soldiers come by,
took a look at what I'm doing.

00:37:00,494 --> 00:37:01,495
You know what they say?

00:37:01,561 --> 00:37:04,731
They say, "Yeah, yeah,
that's our war.

00:37:04,798 --> 00:37:07,534
That's what it's like
waiting and bodyhauling."

00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:09,403
So I had it. I had

00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:11,371
the image that
said it all.

00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:13,874
So yes, I used a lie

00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,342
to tell the truth.

00:37:15,409 --> 00:37:17,044
Well, thanks for the insight.

00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,113
But I'm looking for
another kind of confession.

00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,016
I'm here to bust you
for the murder of Jill Case.

00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:24,151
What?

00:37:24,217 --> 00:37:26,253
Come on, she was hip
to your, uh, you know

00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:27,587
cut and paste scheme and

00:37:27,654 --> 00:37:28,889
she was going to blow
the whistle on you.

00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,991
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, I heard
she committed suicide and look--

00:37:31,058 --> 00:37:32,426
Oh, is that
what you heard?
Yeah.

00:37:32,492 --> 00:37:33,927
Me and her,

00:37:33,994 --> 00:37:35,729
we-we had a history, okay.
We dated.

00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:37,230
But if she felt like
outing me for this

00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:38,598
all I had to do was accuse her
of sexual harassment

00:37:38,665 --> 00:37:39,866
and we both go down.

00:37:39,933 --> 00:37:43,036
Maybe ethical journalism was
worth the price for her.

00:37:43,103 --> 00:37:44,171
Doubtful.

00:37:44,237 --> 00:37:45,405
Without her job,
she had nothing.

00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,107
Well, for a while, she had you.

00:37:47,174 --> 00:37:48,241
Yeah, but not
for long.

00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,277
Bird was rigid
in everything she did.

00:37:50,343 --> 00:37:54,715
Having sex with her
was like... eating glass.

00:37:54,781 --> 00:37:57,451
The lab did a DNA test.

00:37:57,517 --> 00:38:00,253
Your skin cells are
all over the dog leash

00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,955
that was used to hang her.

00:38:02,022 --> 00:38:03,657
Well, I was probably
the last person

00:38:03,724 --> 00:38:04,891
to actually walk that dog.

00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:07,027
God knows she never did.

00:38:12,866 --> 00:38:14,901
Guess this is more like
his crash pad

00:38:14,968 --> 00:38:16,870
between foreign
assignments.

00:38:16,937 --> 00:38:18,238
I'm sorry,

00:38:18,305 --> 00:38:20,307
I just don't see Miss Neat
Knickers and this guy

00:38:20,374 --> 00:38:21,975
making it as a couple, you know.

00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:35,522
Still no laptop.

00:38:37,758 --> 00:38:39,760
Steal it, scrub it and lose it.

00:38:39,826 --> 00:38:41,294
This guy's smart.

00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,363
This is all just circumstantial.

00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:51,872
Now we know how he got her
to write the suicide note.

00:38:51,938 --> 00:38:53,940
She wasn't sorry to be living.

00:38:54,007 --> 00:38:56,109
She was sorry
that Jake was such a liar.

00:38:56,176 --> 00:38:58,779
Well, this is more like
what we need.

00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:08,955
Warrick.

00:39:09,022 --> 00:39:12,292
Didn't Nick's case have
a blue thigh high stocking?

00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:16,096
Yeah.

00:39:28,942 --> 00:39:31,511
Even if he was the one
that strangled Jill,

00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:34,414
there was no blood
at the crime scene.

00:39:34,481 --> 00:39:36,750
Well, with two gunshots
to the chest,

00:39:36,817 --> 00:39:39,119
Jill's twin sister
was a bloody mess.

00:39:49,029 --> 00:39:50,997
Checkmate?

00:39:51,064 --> 00:39:54,201
So he killed them both.

00:39:55,235 --> 00:39:56,770
You must have
thought you were

00:39:56,837 --> 00:39:58,038
losing your mind?

00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:00,173
Let me run it for you.

00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,243
<i>Jill always picked up her dry</i>
<i>cleaning on Thursday nights.</i>

00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:06,747
<i>So right place, right time,</i>

00:40:06,813 --> 00:40:08,882
<i>right car,</i>
<i>looks like the right woman,</i>

00:40:11,351 --> 00:40:12,719
<i>You thought it was done.</i>

00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:14,454
<i>So you go to the house,</i>

00:40:14,521 --> 00:40:16,289
<i>get the computer files</i>

00:40:16,356 --> 00:40:18,225
<i>and you think you're seeing</i>
<i>your conscious</i>

00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:19,426
<i>walk through the door.</i>

00:40:40,981 --> 00:40:42,916
<i>The first time you had a plan.</i>

00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:44,551
<i>Make it look like a mugging.</i>

00:40:44,618 --> 00:40:48,422
<i>The second time,</i>
<i>you had to improvise.</i>

00:40:53,293 --> 00:40:55,095
So there were two of them.

00:40:58,799 --> 00:41:00,667
I dated Jill.

00:41:00,734 --> 00:41:02,669
She kept the most rigid schedule

00:41:02,736 --> 00:41:04,104
of anyone I've ever met,
you know.

00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:06,506
It was always Thursday night
pick up the dry cleaning night.

00:41:06,573 --> 00:41:09,242
And I mean, God forbid I wanted
to see a movie or catch a show

00:41:09,309 --> 00:41:11,478
or something.

00:41:11,545 --> 00:41:13,313
Leave it to Jill
to be so thorough.

00:41:15,282 --> 00:41:17,784
Makes me have to kill her twice.

00:41:31,565 --> 00:41:32,632
We were both right.

00:41:34,668 --> 00:41:37,037
That's a federal offense,
you know.

00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,787
I heard the guys
solved a double murder.

00:41:53,854 --> 00:41:54,921
Mm-hmm.

00:41:54,988 --> 00:41:56,223
I spent the day

00:41:56,289 --> 00:41:58,325
sitting on a bench
outside the courtroom,

00:41:58,392 --> 00:41:59,726
they never got to me.

00:41:59,793 --> 00:42:01,328
That sucks.

00:42:01,395 --> 00:42:03,997
Feeling transcendental?

00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:05,232
Hmm?

00:42:05,298 --> 00:42:06,666
Thoreau. I, uh,

00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,568
I haven't read him
since college.

00:42:08,635 --> 00:42:11,371
Me, neither.
It holds up.

00:42:11,438 --> 00:42:14,074
"I would rather sit on a pumpkin
and have it all to myself,

00:42:14,141 --> 00:42:16,843
than be crowded
on a velvet cushion."

00:42:18,879 --> 00:42:20,547
Oh, look,

00:42:20,614 --> 00:42:22,482
you missed one.

00:42:22,549 --> 00:42:24,151
Sixty-three down.

00:42:24,217 --> 00:42:25,919
"Misanthrope."

00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:33,126
I won't wait up.
