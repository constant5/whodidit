Once, about three hours ago.

00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:08,032
Oh, that's helpful.
Why'd you leave?

00:10:13,337 --> 00:10:15,873
Called Detective Basset
to escort me back to my suite.

00:10:15,939 --> 00:10:17,141
She didn't answer.

00:10:17,207 --> 00:10:18,609
I went by myself.

00:10:18,675 --> 00:10:20,210

You can corroborate this?

00:10:20,277 --> 00:10:21,912

00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:23,113
Okay, good,
there's a record then.

00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,948
So you get back
to you suite. Then what?

00:10:25,015 --> 00:10:28,218
I urinated.
Changed my underwear.

00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:29,887
Came back. Kept playing.

00:12:45,756 --> 00:12:48,792
I'll leave you my
address in Hong Kong.

00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:51,662
You can ship them back to me
when you're done.

00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,632
Thank you.

00:13:07,644 --> 00:13:09,747
Rose petals in the bathtub
had traces

00:13:09,813 --> 00:13:11,582
of grapeseed oil.

00:13:11,648 --> 00:13:13,050
Killer's sleeves
were wet.

00:13:13,117 --> 00:13:15,452
So you get the clothes,
you get your guy.

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,954
Dry cleaner screwed us.

00:13:18,455 --> 00:13:21,091
Did he push all the buttons?

00:13:21,158 --> 00:13:25,129
Yeah. Enough to keep that body
moving, and leave me with

00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:26,597
a lot of partials.

00:13:26,663 --> 00:13:28,265
A lot?

00:13:52,322 --> 00:13:54,324
(beeping)

00:14:13,343 --> 00:14:15,012
You're in my water.

00:14:16,613 --> 00:14:18,849
You're the reason I'm losing!

00:14:22,686 --> 00:14:26,623
DONNA BASSET:
<i>I changed his luck,</i>
<i>and he took my life.</i>

00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,926
Every time he came to Vegas,

00:14:28,992 --> 00:14:33,230
he would gamble
for four hours exactly.

00:14:33,297 --> 00:14:37,468
And, you know,
I took that bath every time.

00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:39,570
You were murdered.

00:14:39,636 --> 00:14:41,638
I was a cop.

00:14:41,705 --> 00:14:43,307
Thought I could
see danger coming.

00:14:43,374 --> 00:14:44,808
Well, not me.

00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:48,145
I got into more train wreck
relationships than I can count.

00:14:48,212 --> 00:14:51,181
And then I met Gavin.

00:14:51,248 --> 00:14:52,449
And...?

00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,917
He was a great guy.

00:14:53,984 --> 00:14:56,587
And then I fell... I fell hard.

00:14:56,653 --> 00:15:00,090
(woman groaning)

00:15:00,157 --> 00:15:03,027
(screaming)

00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:05,529
CURTIS:
Rebecca McGill.

00:15:05,596 --> 00:15:09,666
She was taking a hike
with her husband Gavin.

00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:12,703
He was taking photos.

00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,806
One second she was there,
the next she was gone.

00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,808
He went for help.

00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,810
Hiking accident?

00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,813
Maybe.

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,382
It's going to take you
some time to get down there.

00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:28,752
It's better than
the express route she took.

00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,749
BROWN:
Okay, Mr. Boy Scout.

00:15:39,816 --> 00:15:41,717
Eagle Scout.

00:15:41,784 --> 00:15:46,489
SANDERS:
I didn't earn a chestful
of merit badges for nothing.

00:15:46,556 --> 00:15:48,825
You see anything
interesting up there?

00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:52,762
Well, looks like
she bounced around a lot

00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:55,932
up here at the top
before she caught air.

00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,133
She was hot.

00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,868
You pay for "hot," believe me.

00:16:02,538 --> 00:16:04,140
It's a no-brainer.

00:16:04,207 --> 00:16:06,309
I guess that makes me
the search party.

00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,811
Oh, I see it.

00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:13,416
You're getting warm.

00:16:15,551 --> 00:16:17,920
Hotter by the foot.

00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:21,691
There you go.

00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:28,731
It's hard to crack an egg
without breaking the yolk.

00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:32,869
That's amazing.

00:16:34,737 --> 00:16:36,973
Don't think
she'll be needing it, but...

00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,309
I found her cell phone.

00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:43,946
It was a bald eagle,
and they're extremely rare,

00:16:44,013 --> 00:16:46,816
and Rebecca had to have

00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:50,386
a picture for
our Christmas card.

00:16:50,453 --> 00:16:52,054
It's weird...

00:16:52,121 --> 00:16:56,592
You take a picture,
and you turn back around,

00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:59,962
and life as you know it
is forever changed.

00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,199
Sir, is that the camera
that you used?

00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:05,268
Yeah.
May I see it?

00:17:07,136 --> 00:17:09,539
This was
supposed to be

00:17:09,605 --> 00:17:11,007
our second honeymoon.

00:17:11,074 --> 00:17:13,276
We fell in love
at an Internet

00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:15,044
convention
at the Hilton.

00:17:15,111 --> 00:17:17,046
Couldn't believe my luck.

00:17:17,113 --> 00:17:18,614
A model...

00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:20,850
and a guy like me.

00:17:20,917 --> 00:17:22,885
Beauty and the geek.

00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:27,723
What did you do after she fell?

00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,460
I ran to the edge,

00:17:30,526 --> 00:17:33,496
called down to her,

00:17:33,563 --> 00:17:35,164
and she didn't move.

00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,432
Mr. McGill,

00:17:36,499 --> 00:17:38,968
you hiked
to the ranger station for help.

00:17:39,035 --> 00:17:40,903
Why didn't you just
use your cell phone?

00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,806
Bad reception.

00:17:46,008 --> 00:17:47,443
You're free to go.

00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,645
But stay local.

00:17:49,712 --> 00:17:52,715
Impressive that
it remained intact.

00:17:52,782 --> 00:17:54,350
I'd say.

00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:55,551
So take a look at this.

00:17:55,618 --> 00:17:57,954
The multiple
embedded small rocks

00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,455
present in the neck area,

00:17:59,522 --> 00:18:02,425
also in the parietal
and occipital scalp,

00:18:02,492 --> 00:18:04,260
suggest she landed head first.

00:18:04,327 --> 00:18:05,762
Extremity fractures,

00:18:05,828 --> 00:18:08,030
rib fractures,
spine fracture--

00:18:08,097 --> 00:18:09,432
all consistent
with a fall.

00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:10,500
Multiple abrasions

00:18:10,566 --> 00:18:12,602
on the arms and legs.

00:18:12,668 --> 00:18:14,237
So I am guessing
most were sustained

00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:15,571
before hitting the ground.

00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:18,074
Well, I did find some blood
on the rocks

00:18:18,141 --> 00:18:20,343
at the top of the cliff,
as well as a piece of his shirt.

00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,278
Looks like it was a bumpy ride
all the way down.

00:18:22,345 --> 00:18:24,280
Yeah. Which could
explain these abrasions.

00:18:24,347 --> 00:18:26,849
She tore up her hands

00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,185
grabbing on
to anything she could.

00:18:29,252 --> 00:18:30,920
Severe lacerations

00:18:30,987 --> 00:18:33,423
on the backs
of both hands

00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:35,591
and a broken
right middle finger.

00:18:35,658 --> 00:18:38,761
Was that sustained
during the fall...

00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:41,164
or did someone step on her hand?

00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:46,102
BROWN:
<i>Tina, baby,</i>

00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:48,171
can you give me a call
when you get this?

00:18:48,237 --> 00:18:50,072
Listen, I know we haven't been
spending quality time

00:18:50,139 --> 00:18:52,542
with each other, but I was
thinking tonight we could...
Uh, Warrick--

00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:53,943
Oh.

00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,845
(whispering):
I'll come back.

00:18:56,879 --> 00:18:58,648
Work comes first.

00:18:58,714 --> 00:18:59,649
What's up?

00:18:59,715 --> 00:19:01,217
Oh, uh, tox
came back.

00:19:01,284 --> 00:19:02,351
I detected traces
of sertraline

00:19:02,418 --> 00:19:03,453
in the vic's blood.

00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:05,421
It's a currently
popular anti-depressant.

00:19:05,488 --> 00:19:07,890
She had moderate levels of
alcohol, oh, six percent.

00:19:07,957 --> 00:19:09,392
That's a dangerous
combination.

00:19:09,459 --> 00:19:11,160
But it's not
that unusual.

00:19:11,227 --> 00:19:12,595
Well, would you let
your wife drink

00:19:12,662 --> 00:19:13,629
if she was on medication?

00:19:13,696 --> 00:19:16,065
If I had a wife... no.

00:19:16,132 --> 00:19:19,202
So let me get this straight.

00:19:19,268 --> 00:19:22,738
You took your depressed wife
to the top of Red Rock Canyon,

00:19:22,805 --> 00:19:25,641
shared a bottle
of wine,

00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,410
and then you went
on a nature hike?

00:19:27,477 --> 00:19:29,846
What are you implying?

00:19:29,912 --> 00:19:32,482
Did you know she was
on anti-depressants?

00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:35,017
She made her living
with her looks

00:19:35,084 --> 00:19:39,255
and, lately, she'd been worried
about... losing them.

00:19:39,322 --> 00:19:41,724
Worried enough
to kill herself?

00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:46,129
I was going to take her
to New York and then to Paris.

00:19:46,195 --> 00:19:50,299
We started talking
about planning a family.

00:19:50,366 --> 00:19:52,835
Suicidal people
don't make plans.

00:19:52,902 --> 00:19:54,771
Maybe it wasn't
a suicide,

00:19:54,837 --> 00:19:57,874
but then again,
you're the only one left.

00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,442
You can say anything you want.

00:20:01,778 --> 00:20:04,614
Let's just say your
marriage wasn't so rosy.

00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,382
Alimony's a bitch.

00:20:06,449 --> 00:20:07,617
You get her drunk.

00:20:07,683 --> 00:20:10,853
It's cheap just to
shove her off a cliff.

00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,189
According to the coroner,
the evidence suggests

00:20:13,256 --> 00:20:16,726
that her hands
may have been stepped on.

00:20:16,793 --> 00:20:17,894
(strained cries)

00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,229
(Rebecca screaming,
body thudding)

00:20:20,296 --> 00:20:23,800
You're right,
Rebecca was drifting away.

00:20:23,866 --> 00:20:25,735
She became a different person.

00:20:25,802 --> 00:20:26,903
The meds weren't helping enough.

00:20:26,969 --> 00:20:30,072
I thought if I took her
to Vegas, where we met,

00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:31,307
it would snap her
out of it,

00:20:31,374 --> 00:20:36,245
but instead, she jumped.

00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,749
No, no.

00:20:39,816 --> 00:20:42,985
(crying):
It is my fault.

00:20:43,052 --> 00:20:46,956
I never should've
taken her out there.

00:20:47,023 --> 00:20:49,325
Why didn't you just tell us this
in the first place?

00:20:49,392 --> 00:20:52,762
Would you want people
to know that your wife

00:20:52,829 --> 00:20:55,965
would rather be dead than
spend another minute with you?

00:20:58,334 --> 00:20:59,669
Well, if he <i>is</i> lying,

00:20:59,735 --> 00:21:01,904
somebody should give him
an Emmy Award.

00:21:01,971 --> 00:21:03,172
Well, there's plenty
of physical evidence,

00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:04,540
but it's all ambiguous.

00:21:04,607 --> 00:21:05,541
Yeah.

00:21:05,608 --> 00:21:07,376
Ultimately, I think
he is responsible,

00:21:07,443 --> 00:21:08,745
whether he meant
harm or not.

00:21:08,811 --> 00:21:10,913
Well, you know, there's
precedent for charging him

00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,281
with promoting
a suicide attempt.

00:21:12,348 --> 00:21:13,850
It's reckless
endangerment.

00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,518
There was a case
in New York,

00:21:15,585 --> 00:21:17,820
but it's hard to make
that charge stick.

00:21:17,887 --> 00:21:20,690
Well, what if I can prove she
tried to kill herself before?

00:21:20,757 --> 00:21:22,291
How do you do that?

00:21:22,358 --> 00:21:23,326
Well, I have her phone.

00:21:23,392 --> 00:21:25,061
I could go through
the most recent calls.

00:21:25,128 --> 00:21:26,395
If I know women,

00:21:26,462 --> 00:21:29,031
the husband's usually the
last person to know anything.

00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,495
♪ ♪

00:22:20,616 --> 00:22:21,651
(beep)

00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:23,853
Gavin, what are you doing?
Gav... wait...

00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,054
No! No!

00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:26,255

00:22:26,322 --> 00:22:29,025
Help me! Help... (yells)

00:22:34,063 --> 00:22:36,799
We have a witness.

00:22:36,866 --> 00:22:40,369
Why did you kill your
wife, Mr. McGill?

00:22:41,704 --> 00:22:43,940
You try having a hot wife.

00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:47,543
You pay for it every day.

00:22:51,981 --> 00:22:55,051
I want a lawyer.

00:22:55,118 --> 00:22:59,122
I finally found a guy who
liked me for my brains.

00:22:59,188 --> 00:23:02,125
Turns out he thought
I didn't have any.

00:23:15,004 --> 00:23:16,939
Excuse me, ladies?

00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:18,708
Have you seen
my wife?

00:23:18,775 --> 00:23:20,076
Her-her name's Cara.

00:23:20,143 --> 00:23:22,145
No.

00:23:22,211 --> 00:23:23,746
Or my little girl?

00:23:23,813 --> 00:23:25,782
I had a beautiful
little girl.

00:23:25,848 --> 00:23:27,717
She was only
about that big.

00:23:27,784 --> 00:23:29,719
You ain't seen
her, have you?

00:23:29,786 --> 00:23:31,287
Nope. Just us.

00:23:31,354 --> 00:23:33,122
So they're not here?

00:23:34,357 --> 00:23:35,792
(exhales)

00:23:35,858 --> 00:23:37,293
Okay, then.

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,729
It's okay.

00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,099
Anywhere but here, right?

00:23:45,234 --> 00:23:47,603
(laughs)

00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,071
So, how'd you get here?

00:23:49,138 --> 00:23:51,474
Oh, ma'am,
I thought the war was hell

00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:53,242
until I came to Vegas.

00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:56,245
(tires screech, car crashes)

00:23:57,346 --> 00:23:59,248
WOMAN:
<i>Knucklehead just blew the stop</i>

00:23:59,315 --> 00:24:01,617
and ran right into
the side of my car.

00:24:01,684 --> 00:24:03,853
STOKES:
Damn.

00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,090
You're lucky-- I don't even see
any skid marks.

00:24:07,156 --> 00:24:08,424
Didn't even try to stop!

00:24:08,491 --> 00:24:09,926
Just dropped off my partner--

00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:12,395
otherwise I would've
been sitting in that
passenger seat.

00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:19,368
Hey, Linda...
you didn't touch

00:24:19,435 --> 00:24:21,604
the outside of that
door handle, did you?

00:24:21,671 --> 00:24:23,139
No. I know better.

00:24:23,206 --> 00:24:26,342
Been to a couple of
forensic classes taught
by you lab guys.

00:24:26,409 --> 00:24:29,712
Reached in through the
window to check his
vitals-- he was dead.

00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:32,548
Paramedics pronounced; made
sure no one touched anything.

00:24:32,615 --> 00:24:35,017
You did good.

00:24:35,084 --> 00:24:36,686
This might take a while,

00:24:36,753 --> 00:24:38,354
if you want to take a little
break or something.

00:24:38,421 --> 00:24:40,356
Thanks.

00:24:40,423 --> 00:24:42,058
(helicopter flying overhead)

00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:44,327
ROBBINS:
Hey, Nick.

00:24:44,393 --> 00:24:46,195
Hey, Doc.

00:24:46,262 --> 00:24:48,731
What brings you out?
David's on a pickup,

00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:50,933
and he's got another two
lined up after that.

00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,668
He's going for some
sort of record.

00:24:52,735 --> 00:24:55,505
Dig in.

00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,809
What was going through his mind

00:24:59,876 --> 00:25:02,211
just before he crashed
into the police cruiser?

00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:03,579
"I want to die today

00:25:03,646 --> 00:25:05,548
<i>and</i> take somebody with me"?

00:25:05,615 --> 00:25:07,817
STOKES:
Huh?
Nothing.

00:25:07,884 --> 00:25:09,352
Got a wallet.

00:25:14,957 --> 00:25:17,360
Mr. Russell Caris.

00:25:17,427 --> 00:25:20,897
He has dried blood
on his hands and on

00:25:20,963 --> 00:25:22,331
the steering wheel but no

00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:25,401
bleeding wounds that could
have contributed to it.

00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,405
This could explain the blood.

00:25:29,472 --> 00:25:31,274
Sophia...
Here you go.

00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,443
you might want
to put out a broadcast

00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:35,211
on Mr. Caris and his vehicle.

00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:37,213
Possible stabbing suspect.

00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,781
Well, he's definitely
good for something.

00:25:38,848 --> 00:25:40,149
I'll include the local hospitals

00:25:40,216 --> 00:25:42,018
in case they've had
a stab victim.

00:25:42,085 --> 00:25:44,287
Why wouldn't he have thrown
that knife away?

00:25:44,353 --> 00:25:45,588
He's not smart.

00:25:45,655 --> 00:25:47,423
(laughs):
This is natural selection.

00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,292
The dumb ones die.

00:25:50,326 --> 00:25:51,961
The good ones, too.

00:25:52,028 --> 00:25:54,363
I just found your stab victim.

00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:57,033
CURTIS:
Patrol got a 415B call.

00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,469
Man with a knife.

00:25:59,535 --> 00:26:02,371
The paramedics rolled up
soon after they did.

00:26:02,438 --> 00:26:04,574
The guy was
already dead.

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,542
Was he alone?

00:26:06,609 --> 00:26:09,545
No. He was with his family.

00:26:09,612 --> 00:26:12,582
WOMAN:
<i>We were getting gas,</i>

00:26:12,648 --> 00:26:15,251
and, uh, some lunatic came up...

00:26:15,318 --> 00:26:16,919
(crying)

00:26:16,986 --> 00:26:19,088
...just stabbed my husband
in the chest.

00:26:19,155 --> 00:26:21,424
(continues crying)

00:26:21,491 --> 00:26:24,093
My baby saw Jack get stabbed.

00:26:25,661 --> 00:26:27,830
Did your husband
know the man?

00:26:27,897 --> 00:26:31,167
No. And Jack offered him
his wallet.

00:26:31,234 --> 00:26:35,171
The guy just muttered something,
just... just stabbed Jack.

00:26:35,238 --> 00:26:37,807
(crying):
And left the wallet.

00:26:37,874 --> 00:26:39,842
Why... why did he do this?

00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:43,079
My... my husband just met
his daughter.

00:26:43,146 --> 00:26:46,315
Wha... what do you mean,
he just met his daughter?

00:26:46,382 --> 00:26:48,785
He just got back
from his second tour in Iraq.

00:26:48,851 --> 00:26:52,522
Would you recognize this guy
if you saw him again?

00:26:52,588 --> 00:26:54,590
(baby continues crying)

00:26:55,925 --> 00:26:57,994
Is that him right there?

00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,796
That's him.

00:26:59,862 --> 00:27:01,464
Well... is he dead?

00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:03,666
Who is he?
Why did he kill my husband?

00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:05,268
That's what I'm gonna find out
for you.

00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:07,069
Why don't you go
with this officer right now.

00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,805
She'll take care of you,
all right?

00:27:08,871 --> 00:27:13,810
I'll do my best to keep you
informed, ma'am, I promise.

00:27:13,876 --> 00:27:16,546
Um... I'll check
with the clerk,

00:27:16,612 --> 00:27:18,881
see if his surveillance
camera was working.

00:27:18,948 --> 00:27:22,185
Yeah, there's some-some...
oil and grease around the pump.

00:27:22,251 --> 00:27:24,987
I'll check the tire and...

00:27:25,054 --> 00:27:27,223
shoe impressions.

00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:30,660
CURTIS:
Made it back from the war to die
on the streets of Las Vegas.

00:27:30,726 --> 00:27:32,829
I'm telling you,

00:27:32,895 --> 00:27:35,998
no place is safe anymore.

00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,659
ROBBINS:
<i>Sergeant Jack Day</i>

00:27:42,725 --> 00:27:43,993
was in top condition

00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,996
except for the single
stab wound to his chest.

00:27:47,063 --> 00:27:49,766
Knife entered
the fourth intercostal space,

00:27:49,832 --> 00:27:52,568
transected the fourth
intercostal muscle, and the left

00:27:52,635 --> 00:27:53,736
internal mammary artery.

00:27:53,803 --> 00:27:54,938
C.O.D.'s exsanguination.

00:27:55,004 --> 00:27:56,539
What about

00:27:56,606 --> 00:27:58,141
the crash-test
dummy here?

00:27:58,207 --> 00:28:00,043
Interesting case.

00:28:00,109 --> 00:28:03,413
He has intense erythema
of the tracheal mucosa

00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:06,115
extending down into
the main stem bronchi.

00:28:06,182 --> 00:28:08,184
(inhales)

00:28:09,953 --> 00:28:13,556
You don't get that from
an auto accident, do you?

00:28:13,623 --> 00:28:17,427
No. You get it from inhalation
of some caustic poison or drug.

00:28:17,493 --> 00:28:20,263
I sent samples to Tox.
Okay, good.

00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,799
So... C.O.D.?

00:28:22,865 --> 00:28:25,268
Well, the impact
of the accident caused

00:28:25,335 --> 00:28:27,136
the first cervical
vertebrae to tear away

00:28:27,203 --> 00:28:30,540
from his skull,
lacerating the brain stem.

00:28:30,607 --> 00:28:32,375
His skull separated
from his spine.

00:28:32,442 --> 00:28:33,610
Exactly.

00:28:33,676 --> 00:28:36,245
Should've been wearing
a seat belt.

00:28:36,312 --> 00:28:38,314
(computer beeping quietly)

00:28:55,965 --> 00:28:57,100
No!
(knife stabs)

00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:58,701
Well, why'd he stab him?

00:28:58,768 --> 00:29:01,271
I mean, it's not like
he put up a fight.

00:29:01,337 --> 00:29:05,475
And why does he pick
the biggest guy at the station?

00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:07,844
You think that guy in the back
would be an easier target.

00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:11,748
Rewind it back to this fool
getting out of the Buick.

00:29:11,814 --> 00:29:13,516
(beeping)

00:29:18,187 --> 00:29:22,191
STOKES:
He seems disoriented, shaky...

00:29:22,258 --> 00:29:24,861
high on something.

00:29:24,928 --> 00:29:28,598
ANDREWS:
<i>He had fairly high levels</i>
<i>of THC in his blood.</i>

00:29:28,665 --> 00:29:30,600
97 nanograms
per milliliter.

00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:33,469
THC? That's it?

00:29:33,536 --> 00:29:35,638
Isn't that what you
were looking for?

00:29:35,705 --> 00:29:38,741
No, I was kind of thinking there
was something else in there.

00:29:38,808 --> 00:29:41,411
You should've seen this guy--
he was acting really...

00:29:41,477 --> 00:29:43,112
sketched out.

00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:44,714
Sometimes people
are just crazy.

00:29:47,917 --> 00:29:50,253
♪ ♪

00:30:22,485 --> 00:30:24,320
Well, you're persistent,
I'll give you that.

00:30:24,387 --> 00:30:26,689
I tested the remaining marijuana
in the paper wrapper.

00:30:26,756 --> 00:30:28,191
You were right.

00:30:28,257 --> 00:30:29,225
The joint was dipped.

00:30:29,292 --> 00:30:30,260
PCP?

00:30:30,326 --> 00:30:32,528
No. Embalming fluid.

00:30:32,595 --> 00:30:36,666
"Embalming fluid" is
the street name for PCP.

00:30:36,733 --> 00:30:39,535
Yeah, but I don't use street
names when I don't mean to.

00:30:39,602 --> 00:30:42,272
No, I mean real,
inject-into-a-dead-
person embalming fluid,

00:30:42,338 --> 00:30:43,706
made of formaldehyde,
methanol,

00:30:43,773 --> 00:30:45,441
ethanol, all
that bad stuff.

00:30:45,508 --> 00:30:48,778
So this guy was smoking wet.

00:30:48,845 --> 00:30:52,482
Well, the embalming
fluid would make the
marijuana burn slower,

00:30:52,548 --> 00:30:54,884
giving it more chance
to be absorbed,

00:30:54,951 --> 00:30:58,721
creating a longer lasting
high, I would imagine.

00:30:58,788 --> 00:31:01,791
So, now, what do I tell
Sergeant Day's widow?

00:31:01,858 --> 00:31:04,961
A retired marine who served
two tours in Iraq.

00:31:05,995 --> 00:31:10,433
That-that all this
is about getting higher?

00:31:12,635 --> 00:31:15,772
You got to tell her the truth.

00:31:17,407 --> 00:31:21,144
(crying):
It-it was... it
was just random?

00:31:22,512 --> 00:31:25,715
That's the reason I
don't have a husband?

00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:35,091
That's why?

00:31:35,158 --> 00:31:38,328
(continues crying)

00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:44,634
I'm sorry.

00:31:49,906 --> 00:31:53,443
So after all that,
how can you be happy?

00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:55,511
You don't get it.

00:31:55,578 --> 00:31:58,781
This is the best
week of my life.

00:32:00,683 --> 00:32:04,621
'Cause I got to hold
my baby girl.

00:32:16,065 --> 00:32:17,634
Oh, son of a bitch!

00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,968
Let me tell you something,

00:32:19,035 --> 00:32:21,170
you got nothing to
bitch about here.

00:32:21,237 --> 00:32:24,007
I don't think
you can smoke in here.

00:32:24,073 --> 00:32:25,541
Nah. Let him try.

00:32:25,608 --> 00:32:28,278
REBECCA:
No, you guys,
we're gonna be here a long time.

00:32:28,344 --> 00:32:29,712
Let's just try
to keep it pleasant, okay?

00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:31,214
I'm not even supposed
to be here.

00:32:31,281 --> 00:32:33,216
Tell me about it.

00:32:33,283 --> 00:32:34,984
(chainsaw whirring)
(man screaming)

00:32:35,051 --> 00:32:36,719
(chainsaw strikes
hard surface, stops)

00:32:36,786 --> 00:32:40,490
The hot weather, the full moon,
too many people moving to Vegas.

00:32:40,556 --> 00:32:43,459
Whatever the reason,
the natives are restless.

00:32:43,526 --> 00:32:44,994
Scene's in the garage.

00:32:45,061 --> 00:32:46,863
SIDLE:
Well, that's not a good sign.

00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,197
GRISSOM:
Bacon and eggs?

00:32:48,264 --> 00:32:50,166
Yeah, no, you know,
don't bother about that.

00:32:50,233 --> 00:32:51,434
That's the water delivery boy.

00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:53,736
He lost his breakfast,
and his bottle.

00:32:53,803 --> 00:32:56,639
He said the house belonged
to a guy named Lou Beltran.

00:32:56,706 --> 00:32:58,708
Is he one of the victims?

00:32:58,775 --> 00:33:01,377
He couldn't tell.

00:33:01,444 --> 00:33:03,680
The door's been forced.

00:33:03,746 --> 00:33:05,949
(door creaking)

00:33:11,754 --> 00:33:15,091
I thought this only
happened in the movies.

00:33:17,994 --> 00:33:20,363
Life imitates art.

00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:28,734
(camera shutter clicking)

00:33:32,637 --> 00:33:34,539
Okay.

00:33:34,606 --> 00:33:36,041
You first.

00:33:36,108 --> 00:33:38,043
All right.

00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:41,880
Kicked-in door, one bloody
chainsaw, two dead bodies.

00:33:41,947 --> 00:33:44,850
Someone broke in,
cut up the two guys,

00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:47,219
left the murder weapon
and split.

00:33:47,285 --> 00:33:50,255
What about all this mess,

00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:52,824
the furniture and appliances?

00:33:52,891 --> 00:33:54,459
Some of the furniture looks new.

00:33:54,526 --> 00:33:56,661
Some of it's cut-up,
some of it's not.

00:33:56,728 --> 00:34:00,432
Maybe they were cutting it up
when the assailant came in.

00:34:00,499 --> 00:34:03,602
That's a workable theory
for now.

00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,872
You know what this
reminds me of?

00:34:06,938 --> 00:34:08,540
The first time we met.

00:34:08,607 --> 00:34:10,041
San Francisco.
Your lecture.

00:34:10,108 --> 00:34:11,143
Double murder in a garage.

00:34:11,209 --> 00:34:13,211
I'd heard you were a little dull

00:34:13,278 --> 00:34:15,080
as a speaker,

00:34:15,147 --> 00:34:17,115
but you can't rely
on your first blush.

00:34:19,151 --> 00:34:22,220
That was the, uh,
subject of your talk.

00:34:22,287 --> 00:34:24,990
I believe I said
first opinions are crucial,

00:34:25,057 --> 00:34:27,292
but if the evidence changes,
so must the theory.

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,127
Exactly.

00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:30,829
Hey.

00:34:30,896 --> 00:34:33,098
Any ID on them yet?

00:34:33,165 --> 00:34:34,566
We're still working our way in.

00:34:34,633 --> 00:34:35,901
Well, you know,
I'm kinda stuck

00:34:35,967 --> 00:34:38,003
until I know
who they are, so, uh...

00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,471
Sara, do me a favor, will you?

00:34:39,538 --> 00:34:40,705
Reach into that barbecue

00:34:40,772 --> 00:34:42,307
and hand me
his wallet.
Sure.

00:34:47,779 --> 00:34:48,780
Thank you.

00:34:49,848 --> 00:34:51,483
This guy doesn't live here.

00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,517
This is Ray Gaynor,

00:34:52,584 --> 00:34:53,785
lives a few houses down.

00:34:55,187 --> 00:34:56,188
Maybe the other one's Lou.

00:34:57,789 --> 00:35:00,959
I don't know, but I'd bet my
right arm that's his left arm.

00:35:01,026 --> 00:35:02,694
(Brass chuckles)

00:35:04,062 --> 00:35:05,664
I'm gonna see if the one-arm man

00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:07,866
has a wife who knows
how to operate a chainsaw.

00:35:11,837 --> 00:35:13,605
It was a jagged,
sharp force injury

00:35:13,672 --> 00:35:15,807
to the base of the neck
on the right side.

00:35:15,874 --> 00:35:18,410
Wound extends
down and left laterally

00:35:18,477 --> 00:35:20,612
from the right shoulder
to the left hip.

00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:22,981
Wound becomes shallow
and then separates

00:35:23,048 --> 00:35:25,350
into individual incisions.

00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:27,352
Directionality
of the individual wounds

00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:30,756
is from bottom to top.

00:35:30,822 --> 00:35:33,125
All chainsaws operate
the same way, right?

00:35:33,191 --> 00:35:34,459
Chain travels

00:35:34,526 --> 00:35:36,962
around the bar, teeth move
away from the operator

00:35:37,028 --> 00:35:38,864
around the top and come
back on the bottom.

00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,699
Mm-hmm.

00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:43,101
So, if our guy, Lou,

00:35:43,168 --> 00:35:46,371
was attacked from the front,

00:35:46,438 --> 00:35:49,141
the teeth would hit him
from a downward angle.

00:35:49,207 --> 00:35:51,810
Leaving downward wounds
instead of

00:35:51,877 --> 00:35:53,645
the upward wounds you see here.

00:35:53,712 --> 00:35:56,982
So... what?

00:35:57,048 --> 00:35:59,117
He was attacked from behind?

00:36:06,525 --> 00:36:07,893
Guess who owns the chainsaw.

00:36:10,062 --> 00:36:11,863
Ray Gaynor.

00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,131
The neighbor.

00:36:13,198 --> 00:36:14,299
I also found bits

00:36:14,366 --> 00:36:15,967
of wood and metal shavings

00:36:16,034 --> 00:36:17,469
on the inside
of the cover plate,

00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,970
consistent with the furniture

00:36:19,037 --> 00:36:19,971
and appliances.

00:36:20,038 --> 00:36:21,073
The teeth

00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:23,075
on the chain are dull,

00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:25,844
probably from cutting them up.

00:36:25,911 --> 00:36:29,347
Don't tell me Lou cut up
my mother's headboard.

00:36:29,414 --> 00:36:31,316
Was it blue?

00:36:32,717 --> 00:36:34,252
Sorry.

00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:35,921
How about my dining room set?

00:36:35,987 --> 00:36:37,856
Um...

00:36:37,923 --> 00:36:39,524
I think there's a couple
of chairs left.

00:36:39,591 --> 00:36:41,193
Damn that man.

00:36:41,259 --> 00:36:43,628
Everything I asked
for in the divorce.

00:36:43,695 --> 00:36:45,063
Did he get the
living room furniture?

00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,298
No.

00:36:46,364 --> 00:36:47,766
Figures. That was
going to be his.

00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:49,501
Well, now it's mine.

00:36:49,568 --> 00:36:51,903
The bastard can rot in hell.

00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:54,840
So, Mrs. Beltran, I assume
the divorce wasn't final.

00:36:54,906 --> 00:36:56,374
No.

00:36:56,441 --> 00:36:58,043
Lou held it up out of spite.

00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,078
Hmm. Do you know Ray Gaynor?

00:37:00,145 --> 00:37:03,381
Decent guy. Never married.

00:37:03,448 --> 00:37:05,083
Lots of women around, though.

00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,018
Pretty handy with his tools.

00:37:07,085 --> 00:37:08,987
Uh-huh.
Halfwit would
go over there

00:37:09,054 --> 00:37:10,622
and Ray'd teach him
how to do things.

00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:13,425
Too bad he never taught him
how to be more of a man.

00:37:13,492 --> 00:37:16,261
Look, I gotta ask you this--
where were you last night?

00:37:16,328 --> 00:37:18,930
32,000 feet over the Pacific

00:37:18,997 --> 00:37:20,766
with 300 other people.

00:37:20,832 --> 00:37:23,402
So you were in a plane.

00:37:23,468 --> 00:37:24,970
I'm a flight attendant.

00:37:25,036 --> 00:37:28,373
But go ahead and ask me
if I'm sorry he's dead.

00:37:31,877 --> 00:37:34,279
SIDLE:
Where do you want him?

00:37:34,346 --> 00:37:35,881
Put him under
the Lou Beltran spatter.

00:37:38,016 --> 00:37:40,152
And load him up.

00:38:05,811 --> 00:38:07,979
SIDLE:
Blue test paint
is not lining up

00:38:08,046 --> 00:38:09,548
with the red known spatter.

00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,685
Well, the body's in the
correct relative position.

00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:15,053
but the angle's off.

00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,321
What could throw
the angle off?

00:38:16,388 --> 00:38:18,190
I don't know,
but it's very awkward

00:38:18,256 --> 00:38:20,559
to try and line this up.

00:38:21,727 --> 00:38:23,562
You know...

00:38:26,198 --> 00:38:27,833
What if you line it up

00:38:27,899 --> 00:38:30,869
switching hands, like this?

00:38:42,114 --> 00:38:44,015
Ray Gaynor's killer
was left-handed.

00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:47,886
Lou Beltran wore

00:38:47,953 --> 00:38:49,988
his watch on his right wrist.

00:38:51,256 --> 00:38:53,492
I bet he was left-handed.

00:38:53,558 --> 00:38:56,661
So... Lou could have killed Ray,

00:38:56,728 --> 00:38:58,363
cut off his arm...

00:38:59,831 --> 00:39:00,966
...but who killed Lou?

00:39:01,032 --> 00:39:03,568
Doc Robbins

00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:05,771
said that the cuts on
Lou's body were made

00:39:05,837 --> 00:39:08,240
when the chain was
traveling upwards.

00:39:08,306 --> 00:39:09,708
Well, if I attacked you,

00:39:09,775 --> 00:39:11,810
the chain would be
traveling downwards

00:39:11,877 --> 00:39:16,047
when held normally by a left-
or a right-handed person.

00:39:16,114 --> 00:39:17,783
Which means that
the top of the chain

00:39:17,849 --> 00:39:20,085
had to be facing him.

00:39:20,152 --> 00:39:21,653
The way that this works,

00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,123
is if Lou was holding the saw.

00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,258
The chain was dull

00:39:26,324 --> 00:39:27,793
from cutting up
his wife's things.

00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:30,262
The wife told Brass
that he wasn't very handy.

00:39:30,328 --> 00:39:34,132
An inexperienced left-handed
operator with a dull chainsaw

00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:36,301
certainly increases
the risk for injury.

00:39:38,537 --> 00:39:39,638
Kickback.

00:39:43,275 --> 00:39:44,443
You don't know
what you're doing!

00:39:44,509 --> 00:39:45,710
I know exactly what I'm doing!

00:39:45,777 --> 00:39:48,413
(screams)

00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,783
So he chainsawed his wife's
furniture and appliances,

00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,152
the metal dulled the blade,

00:39:54,219 --> 00:39:57,689
and the kickback from the
chainsaw is what killed him.

00:39:57,756 --> 00:40:00,358
So it was an accident.

00:40:00,425 --> 00:40:01,893
How many of you
are right-handed?

00:40:03,562 --> 00:40:04,629
Left-handed?

00:40:05,797 --> 00:40:08,500
2,500 left-handed people
die each year

00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:11,136
using products designed
for right-handed people.

00:40:11,203 --> 00:40:14,072
Okay, but how do you know
there wasn't a third person

00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:15,540
that killed both of them?

00:40:15,607 --> 00:40:18,777
A third person would have left
shoe impressions in the blood,

00:40:18,844 --> 00:40:20,812
various other sign--
there was none.

00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:22,781
You're absolutely certain?

00:40:22,848 --> 00:40:25,517
Part of being a CSI is learning

00:40:25,584 --> 00:40:28,320
to work in the absence
of absolute certainty.

00:40:28,387 --> 00:40:29,988
Each and every
case brings us

00:40:30,055 --> 00:40:31,656
a new opportunity
to learn something.

00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:35,060
For instance, in the case
of Donna Basset, we can see that

00:40:35,127 --> 00:40:37,129
there is no such thing
as an insignificant detail.

00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:41,900
Here, the evidence itself
can bear witness.

00:40:41,967 --> 00:40:44,236
Don't just look for what you
think you're going to find.

00:40:44,302 --> 00:40:45,937
And this one,

00:40:46,004 --> 00:40:49,541
never impose logic
on an illogical act.

00:40:49,608 --> 00:40:50,609
And finally,

00:40:50,675 --> 00:40:52,277
if the evidence changes,

00:40:52,344 --> 00:40:55,514
your theory must change as well.

00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,149
Questions?

00:41:00,652 --> 00:41:02,454
How do you deal
with the smell?

00:41:02,521 --> 00:41:04,356
You get used to it.

00:41:04,423 --> 00:41:06,992
I'm not sure I can do this.

00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:08,927
Well, not everyone can.

00:41:08,994 --> 00:41:10,762
Why do you do it?

00:41:10,829 --> 00:41:14,433
Because the dead
can't speak for themselves.
