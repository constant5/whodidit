WILLOWS:
Gil, where's the fire?

00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:38,969
It's been sitting in my office
for the last four weeks.

00:01:39,036 --> 00:01:40,304
But...

00:01:40,371 --> 00:01:43,107
We caught the Miniature
serial killer; he confessed.

00:01:43,173 --> 00:01:45,676
Yeah, I watched him
blow his brains out.

00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:46,777
But I think the package

00:01:46,844 --> 00:01:49,280
was postmarked <i>after</i>
he killed himself.

00:01:49,346 --> 00:01:53,617
So maybe he arranged
to have it sent postmortem.

00:01:53,684 --> 00:01:56,086
The three other murders,

00:01:56,153 --> 00:01:58,255
the miniature was
left at the scene.

00:01:58,322 --> 00:01:59,823
This one was addressed to me.

00:02:01,258 --> 00:02:03,894
So, now it's personal?

00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:08,866
GRISSOM:
The victim appears to be
a Caucasian female

00:02:08,932 --> 00:02:11,201
with lots of books.

00:02:11,268 --> 00:02:13,837
It could be an office,
somebody's living room...

00:02:13,904 --> 00:02:16,040
or a modern hotel lobby.

00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:18,242
When I was gone, did anybody
work a scene like this?

00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:20,844
No... at least
not on our shift.

00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:24,315
I'll check with days and swing,

00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:26,884
and see if anybody caught
a case that matches.

00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:28,018
Never mind.

00:02:28,085 --> 00:02:28,986

My name is Ernest Edward Dell.

00:03:32,426 --> 00:03:38,666
I was born in 1946
in Ames, Iowa.

00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:40,634
My life's been hard,

00:03:40,701 --> 00:03:43,404

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,673
I never expected better.

00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:49,777
I'm good with my hands.

00:03:49,844 --> 00:03:51,779
I make things.
I fix things.

00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:53,481
I'm a handyman.

00:03:53,547 --> 00:03:54,949
That's what I am.

00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:58,385
<i>I'm not the sociable type.</i>
<i>I-I know that.</i>

00:03:58,452 --> 00:04:00,955
<i>You spend any amount of time</i>
<i>around people,</i>

00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:02,389
<i>you get your heart broke--</i>

00:04:02,456 --> 00:04:07,394
<i>treachery, hypocrisy...</i>

00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:09,463
<i>the promise of love.</i>

00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,301
A man has a right
to an honest day's pay.

00:04:14,368 --> 00:04:19,039
Me, I service the machinery
of death so that people can eat.

00:04:21,742 --> 00:04:23,677
If that makes me evil,
then so be it.

00:04:23,744 --> 00:04:27,214
The Miniature Killer murdered
three people over a period

00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:28,415
of roughly six months.

00:04:28,482 --> 00:04:30,584
Ernie Dell was either
directly or indirectly

00:04:30,651 --> 00:04:31,752
related to all of them.

00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:34,522
What's with the bloody dolls?

00:04:34,588 --> 00:04:35,923
We're not sure.

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,858
There's a different perspective

00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:40,060
of that same image
in all of the miniatures.

00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:44,331
We're thinking it could
be some kind of signature.

00:04:44,398 --> 00:04:48,202
Look into the mouth of a person
and you'll find lies

00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:52,006
wriggling there like maggots
waiting to grow wings.

00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:55,376
The world has... has gone mad.

00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:59,079
A man could kill from sunup

00:04:59,146 --> 00:05:05,586
to sunset, and still his work
would never be done.

00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:08,823
(gunshot)

00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:15,863
Remember the Blue Paint killers?

00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,032
Maybe Ernie Dell had a partner.

00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:20,367
Like an apprentice, 
an accomplice,
something like that.

00:05:20,434 --> 00:05:21,869
Or a disciple.

00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:23,537
You guys make models
when you were kids?

00:05:23,604 --> 00:05:25,105
Tanks and airplanes.

00:05:25,172 --> 00:05:26,607
Classic cars.

00:05:26,674 --> 00:05:30,044
These miniatures
are obsessively precise,

00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,846
half-inch scale models
of the crime scenes.

00:05:31,912 --> 00:05:36,283
They probably took weeks
of focused effort to create.

00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,552
I don't think the killer's
into team sports.

00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:40,955
Izzy Delancy...

00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,291
he was a rock star.

00:05:44,358 --> 00:05:46,494
You know, famous brings out
the nut jobs.

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,629
Maybe we're just looking
at a copycat.

00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:50,464
The miniatures were never
released to the press.

00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:52,099
No photos, nothing.

00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,168
You can't copy
what you can't see.

00:05:54,235 --> 00:05:56,604
Other people had access
to those files.

00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,606
Maybe it was a cop.

00:05:58,672 --> 00:06:00,741
Or somebody in the lab.

00:06:00,808 --> 00:06:02,309
It's been known to happen.

00:06:04,512 --> 00:06:06,714
Yeah, so, Ernie Dell takes
the rap for three murders,

00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,716
and then eats a .38. Why?

00:06:10,184 --> 00:06:13,220
I think he was trying
to protect someone--

00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:16,557
someone that he cared
a <i>lot</i> about.

00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:36,710
Prints and DNA are going over
the package and wrapping paper.

00:06:36,777 --> 00:06:38,979
They won't find anything.

00:06:39,046 --> 00:06:41,916
Return address was an empty lot.

00:06:44,018 --> 00:06:45,953
Any clue
as to who the victim is?

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,089
No, I even went
through her little purse.

00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,695
Well, she's not wearing
a wedding ring.

00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:57,998
She's probably single.

00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:01,735
Her eyes appear
to be bloodshot.

00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:05,573
Petechial hemorrhaging?

00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,710
GRISSOM:

00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,883
Blue smudges on the pillow.

00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,953
Blue mascara on the victim.

00:07:24,425 --> 00:07:29,296
Our vic gets comfortable,
grabs a little shut-eye...

00:07:34,702 --> 00:07:37,471
...and never wakes up.

00:07:39,306 --> 00:07:41,075
She's going to be smothered.

00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:43,143
It would seem so.

That's different
than the others.

00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:55,923
Methods change.

00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,758

00:08:01,362 --> 00:08:02,630
What?

00:08:02,696 --> 00:08:04,999
Keppler said something
like that once.

00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:10,271
He did come down
on the right side.

00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:18,913
GRISSOM:
These books are all arranged
by subject matter:

00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:23,083
art, religion, science...

00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:27,288

well-educated.

00:08:37,064 --> 00:08:39,099

00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,952

Yeah, it's like Ernie Dell

Received his wife's
Social Security benefits.

00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:48,836
Ms. Tallman? Las Vegas Police.

00:14:48,903 --> 00:14:50,571
You need to open
your door, please.

00:14:56,076 --> 00:14:58,078
Ms. Tallman?

00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:00,548
Open and stand clear.

00:15:04,084 --> 00:15:06,086
(loud music blasting)

00:15:27,942 --> 00:15:29,577
(door opens)

00:15:33,247 --> 00:15:35,249
(singing along)

00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,790
(screaming)

00:15:44,058 --> 00:15:45,192
(music continues blasting)
Please, ma'am, calm down.

00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:46,560
We're with the Crime Lab.

00:15:46,627 --> 00:15:48,996
This isn't a lab.
This is my home.

00:15:49,063 --> 00:15:50,731
You must be confused.

00:15:50,798 --> 00:15:53,400
No, we're not confused.
We're here for your protection.

00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:54,935
(clicks music off)

00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:57,538
Ms. Tallman...

00:15:57,605 --> 00:16:00,040
Dr. Tallman.

00:16:00,107 --> 00:16:02,209
Dr. Tallman...

00:16:02,276 --> 00:16:04,111
I need you to take
a look at this.

00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:08,048
Did you make this for me?

00:16:08,115 --> 00:16:10,284
That's very sweet.

00:16:10,351 --> 00:16:11,452
It's a death threat.

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,020
Who would want to kill me?

00:16:13,087 --> 00:16:15,122
Doctor, do you normally

00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:17,424
take a nap around
the same time every day

00:16:17,491 --> 00:16:19,760
covering your face

00:16:19,827 --> 00:16:20,961
and eyes with the pillow?

00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:22,763
Yes, at 4:00 p.m.

00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:26,000
I... I have tea and cookies

00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:28,235
every day when I wake up.

00:16:28,302 --> 00:16:30,171
Have you been
watching me?

00:16:30,237 --> 00:16:33,674
No, Miss, no, but we think
someone else has.

00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:35,009
Doctor, your life is in danger.

00:16:35,075 --> 00:16:36,911
We need you to get dressed
and come with us, please.

00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:40,014
Am I in trouble?

00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,215
STOKES:
No, ma'am.

00:16:41,282 --> 00:16:43,217
No, not anymore.

00:16:43,284 --> 00:16:44,251
This officer will help you

00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:46,086
get your things, okay?

00:16:46,153 --> 00:16:48,088
No, no, no.

00:16:48,155 --> 00:16:51,091
I'll go get my things.

00:16:51,158 --> 00:16:52,760
I want you to know that

00:16:52,827 --> 00:16:56,430
you young men are
refreshingly polite.

00:16:57,464 --> 00:16:58,933
Thank you.

00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,405
Is she on something?

00:17:04,471 --> 00:17:06,407
She may have already
been poisoned.

00:17:06,473 --> 00:17:07,942
We'll get her
to the hospital.

00:17:08,008 --> 00:17:09,810
We should collect blood for tox.

00:17:09,877 --> 00:17:11,579
And any open food or drink.

00:17:12,947 --> 00:17:14,748
Hey, go on, shoo!

00:17:14,815 --> 00:17:17,751
The killer did plan
every detail.

00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:19,687
Except for us showing up.

00:17:23,581 --> 00:17:26,016
(static, bell dinging,
kids laughing)

00:17:36,327 --> 00:17:38,929
That's got to be
Ernie Dell's wife.

00:17:38,996 --> 00:17:40,631
Quite the bash.

00:17:40,698 --> 00:17:43,200
(train whistle blows,
kids laughing)

00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:44,835
They must love kids.

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,105
(singing
"Happy Birthday To You")

00:17:48,172 --> 00:17:50,107
Is that Ernie's son?

00:17:50,174 --> 00:17:51,976
There's no record of a son,

00:17:52,042 --> 00:17:53,310
but it sure looks like it.

00:17:53,377 --> 00:17:55,379
SIDLE:
One, two, three, four, five

00:17:55,446 --> 00:17:57,181
birthday candles in 1988

00:17:57,248 --> 00:17:58,782
would make him around 24 now.

00:17:58,849 --> 00:18:00,551
(all laughing)

00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:09,026
JOHNSON:
Hmm. Don't look like
a very happy birthday.

00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,629
Did you get
the boy's name?

00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,465
Cake never made it on camera.

00:18:14,532 --> 00:18:15,699
How about audio?

00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:17,902
It sucks. '80s video cam

00:18:17,968 --> 00:18:20,070
with built-in,
non-directional mic,

00:18:20,137 --> 00:18:22,206
pulls in nothing
but wind and train noise.

00:18:22,273 --> 00:18:23,641
So let's process it.

00:18:23,707 --> 00:18:25,176
This is processed.

00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:32,583
We ran tox
on Ms. Tallman's blood

00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,585
as well as her milk
and cookies.

00:18:34,652 --> 00:18:35,920
She was negative
on everything

00:18:35,986 --> 00:18:37,388
from pharmaceuticals
and illicits,

00:18:37,454 --> 00:18:40,057
to herbicides, pesticides
and heavy metals.

00:18:40,124 --> 00:18:41,759
You sure she was
going to be poisoned?

00:18:41,825 --> 00:18:44,028
No, but I'm pretty sure
she was scheduled to die today.

00:18:44,094 --> 00:18:45,596
In each of the
previous cases,

00:18:45,663 --> 00:18:47,631
the killer was at the scene
to commit the murder.

00:18:47,698 --> 00:18:51,335
So maybe he was planning
to show up at the condo.

00:18:51,402 --> 00:18:54,438
Well, it'd be kind
of rude not to greet
him, don't you think?

00:19:10,888 --> 00:19:13,257
I'm ready for my close-up.

00:19:17,561 --> 00:19:19,463
Definitely beats
walking the beat.

00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:24,568
Feed's good.

00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:26,370
Officer Kamen, how's your read?

00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,609
Time to go to sleep.

00:19:36,847 --> 00:19:39,250
All units, this is Brass.

00:19:39,316 --> 00:19:41,018
Maintain a low profile.

00:19:41,085 --> 00:19:43,087
That means I don't want
to see a uniform

00:19:43,153 --> 00:19:44,722
within three blocks
of this place, okay?

00:20:02,006 --> 00:20:04,008
Where you headed?
11.

00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:11,182
Oh, sorry. Ten.

00:20:13,217 --> 00:20:15,586
Go on up.

00:20:20,024 --> 00:20:21,358
(elevator bell dings)

00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:30,734
MAN:
Hold the elevator.

00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:33,771
What floor?

00:20:34,872 --> 00:20:36,674
11.

00:20:40,044 --> 00:20:41,312
Someone's coming up.

00:20:41,378 --> 00:20:43,047
White male with a suitcase.

00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,565
We got a possible.

00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:05,769
LVPD. Up against the wall.

00:21:05,836 --> 00:21:07,605
What?
She said hands
against the wall.

00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:11,275
What's your business here, sir?
Nothing.

00:21:11,342 --> 00:21:13,344
I mean, this is
my sister's place.

00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,246
I'm Peyton Tallman.

00:21:15,312 --> 00:21:17,281
Where's Barbara?
Did something happen to her?

00:21:20,818 --> 00:21:23,053
This officer will
explain everything

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,722
to your satisfaction.
Get him out of here.

00:21:24,788 --> 00:21:26,023
What?

00:21:27,525 --> 00:21:29,460
BRASS (on phone):
Peyton Tallman's ID checks out.

00:21:29,527 --> 00:21:31,128
And I kind of doubt
the killer's going to make

00:21:31,195 --> 00:21:33,631
a miniature crime scene
of his own sister's house.

00:21:33,697 --> 00:21:36,200
And we have nothing to link him
to the other three murders?

00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:38,135
He wants to see his sister.

00:21:38,202 --> 00:21:39,403
I'll let you know
how that goes down.

00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,472
Okay. Thanks.

00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,542
(phone beeps off)

00:21:53,651 --> 00:21:56,754
♪ ♪

00:22:07,731 --> 00:22:08,999
Okay, that's it.

00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:10,334
Killer's not
gonna show.

00:22:12,136 --> 00:22:14,171
Let's call it a night.

00:22:31,355 --> 00:22:33,490
All right, I know
you must be exhausted

00:22:33,557 --> 00:22:35,392
after your brutal day
in the field,

00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:37,761
but it's time to go.

00:22:39,263 --> 00:22:41,832
Officer Kamen?

00:22:49,206 --> 00:22:52,243
(camera shutter clicking,
garbled radio transmission)

00:22:54,245 --> 00:22:57,014
She's pale.

00:22:57,081 --> 00:22:59,049
No sign of trauma.

00:22:59,116 --> 00:23:00,818
COD'll have to wait
till autopsy.

00:23:00,885 --> 00:23:02,119
Sorry.

00:23:02,186 --> 00:23:04,555
Not as sorry as I am.

00:23:04,622 --> 00:23:06,757
(garbled radio transmission)

00:23:46,741 --> 00:23:48,643
Look, I know
we've all had a tough day,

00:23:48,709 --> 00:23:51,646
but the sooner we get done here,
the sooner we can all go home.

00:23:51,712 --> 00:23:54,215
(sniffles)
Why? So my little Tripper
can run out to greet me?

00:23:54,282 --> 00:23:55,383
Barbara.

00:23:55,449 --> 00:23:57,585
I'm sorry about your cat, ma'am.
We lost an officer.

00:23:57,652 --> 00:23:59,520
How much did you love her?
Barbara, please.

00:23:59,587 --> 00:24:00,755
When my guys went

00:24:00,822 --> 00:24:03,191
to your house, they said
you were a little out of it,

00:24:03,257 --> 00:24:04,392
but you're thinking clearly
now, right?

00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:05,560
(scoffs)

00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:07,695
Well, having your home invaded
can be a little bracing.

00:24:07,762 --> 00:24:09,764
Captain, how can we help?

00:24:09,831 --> 00:24:12,333
Can you tell me why
anyone would want to kill you?

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,234
No.

00:24:13,301 --> 00:24:15,436
But you can.

00:24:15,503 --> 00:24:17,505
Well, Barbara was a
highly regarded psychotherapist.

00:24:17,572 --> 00:24:19,207
<i>Is.</i>

00:24:19,273 --> 00:24:20,474
That hasn't changed.

00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:21,742
Is or was?

00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:23,211
I'm retired.

00:24:23,277 --> 00:24:24,679
You seem a little young
to be retired.

00:24:24,745 --> 00:24:26,113
I got tired of it.

00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,016
Can you tell me why one of her
patients would want to kill her?

00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:30,284
No.

00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:31,752
Well, no,
it's-it's possible.

00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:35,089
She, um... she counseled
a lot of at-risk adults,

00:24:35,156 --> 00:24:37,558
um, halfway house
kids, pro bono.

00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,927
I also treated
suburban sexual dysfunction

00:24:39,994 --> 00:24:41,295
for $300 an hour.

00:24:41,362 --> 00:24:42,964
PEYTON:
She helped a lot
of people.

00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,599
Did you work out of your home?

00:24:44,665 --> 00:24:46,634
For the last few years.

00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:48,736
Treat any sociopaths?

00:24:48,803 --> 00:24:51,539
(laughs)
That's not a term for which
there's any diagnostic criteria.

00:24:51,606 --> 00:24:53,608
You're not looking
for one of my patients.

00:24:53,674 --> 00:24:54,742
Well, maybe I am.

00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:56,611
Maybe I'm looking for
a 20-something-year-old male,

00:24:56,677 --> 00:24:57,778
last name of Dell.

00:24:57,845 --> 00:24:58,746
Won't say.

00:24:58,813 --> 00:24:59,947
She can't say.

00:25:00,014 --> 00:25:01,415
It's doctor-patient
confidentiality.

00:25:01,482 --> 00:25:02,383
But you're retired.

00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,784
Well, you know where I live.
Are you done yet?

00:25:03,851 --> 00:25:06,454
No, we're not done yet.
At least, I'm not done yet.

00:25:06,521 --> 00:25:09,023
All right, look,
let's start again, all right?

00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,424
Let's...

00:25:10,491 --> 00:25:13,060
Maybe we started off
on the wrong foot, all right?

00:25:13,127 --> 00:25:15,463
Look, I'm asking you
as a professional,

00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,731
as a psychotherapist,

00:25:16,797 --> 00:25:19,433
please... help me out here.

00:25:22,537 --> 00:25:26,040
Okay? Tell me...
what am I looking for?

00:25:33,481 --> 00:25:35,883
Repetition...

00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:40,521
attention to detail indicates
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

00:25:40,588 --> 00:25:43,758
Obvious antisocial personality.

00:25:43,825 --> 00:25:45,493
Uh, yeah,

00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,995
four bodies--
I'd call that antisocial.

00:25:48,062 --> 00:25:51,732
Most murderers lack
impulse control,

00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:54,202
inability
to plan ahead, but...

00:25:54,268 --> 00:25:56,237
this one's different.

00:25:57,605 --> 00:25:59,607
Different how?

00:26:02,176 --> 00:26:04,445
He conceives murder...

00:26:04,512 --> 00:26:06,514
visualizes it.

00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:10,351
Then he takes all that horror
that he's imagined.

00:26:10,418 --> 00:26:12,186
He compresses it
into these little rooms.

00:26:12,253 --> 00:26:17,358
These models literally indicate
repressed rage.

00:26:19,427 --> 00:26:23,130
And when you start
taking that apart,

00:26:23,197 --> 00:26:25,366
all that rage
comes flying out...

00:26:26,801 --> 00:26:31,172
...and you will have let
the monster out of the box.

00:26:41,415 --> 00:26:43,050
Stop hovering, Hodges.

00:26:43,117 --> 00:26:44,485
You're in
or you're out.

00:26:44,552 --> 00:26:45,786
In.

00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,192
So, she wasn't poisoned, huh?

00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:52,727
No.

00:26:52,793 --> 00:26:54,562
Hand me a scalpel.

00:27:07,008 --> 00:27:09,043
Tweezers.

00:27:21,122 --> 00:27:24,325
Nice lungs.

00:27:46,747 --> 00:27:48,516
(computer beeps)

00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,818
(phone ringing, beep)

00:27:52,386 --> 00:27:54,255
Grissom.

00:27:54,322 --> 00:27:57,592
ROBBINS:
Yeah, Gil, uh,
got a good idea on COD

00:27:57,658 --> 00:28:00,194
for your asphyxiated officer.

00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,563
Internal organ color nailed it

00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,800
on both the autopsy
and necropsy as...

00:28:05,867 --> 00:28:07,235
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

00:28:07,301 --> 00:28:08,402
You know,

00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:10,505
nobody likes when you do that.

00:28:10,571 --> 00:28:13,307
So, how did CO get
into the room?

00:28:13,374 --> 00:28:15,409
That I don't know.

00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:17,245
(phone beeps off)

00:28:17,311 --> 00:28:19,313
(beeping)

00:28:21,482 --> 00:28:25,520
(beeps)

00:28:25,586 --> 00:28:28,055
(trilling and beeps)

00:28:29,123 --> 00:28:31,292
(beep)

00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:05,660
STOKES:
<i>The timer goes off,</i>

00:29:05,726 --> 00:29:08,996
<i>activating the motor,</i>
<i>which closes the flue</i>

00:29:09,063 --> 00:29:10,731
<i>and drops powdered charcoal</i>
<i>onto the flames,</i>

00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:13,801
<i>producing carbon monoxide.</i>

00:29:13,868 --> 00:29:16,504
<i>Fumes have nowhere to go</i>
<i>but out into the apartment,</i>

00:29:16,571 --> 00:29:19,540
<i>into Officer Kamen.</i>

00:29:19,607 --> 00:29:21,309
And the cat.

00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:24,111
You know, this timer was
geared to run for weeks.

00:29:24,178 --> 00:29:26,214
It could have easily
been put in place

00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,516
a month ago.

00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:29,951
That's why the killer
felt safe enough

00:29:30,017 --> 00:29:31,486
to send me the miniature.

00:29:31,552 --> 00:29:33,054
He never intended
to be at the scene.

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,456
There was no danger
of being caught.

00:29:37,758 --> 00:29:40,027
Hey, Sara,
check this out.

00:29:40,094 --> 00:29:41,796
I was digging through
Mannleigh Chicken's

00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:42,964
employee health
insurance records...

00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,099
45 million Americans
without health coverage,

00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:47,435
and a chicken slaughterhouse
provides medical benefits?

00:29:47,502 --> 00:29:50,071
Izzy Delancy's
animal rights PSA
forced the company

00:29:50,137 --> 00:29:52,673
to clean up its act
in all departments.

00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,042
Anyway, Ernie Dell had
one dependent listed:

00:29:55,109 --> 00:29:56,444
a son.

00:29:56,511 --> 00:29:57,678
"Lionel Dell."

00:29:57,745 --> 00:29:58,913
Unbelievable.

00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,481
Yeah, the man
loved his trains.

00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,316
Lionel changed his name
to Mitchell Douglas

00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,418
after he turned 18,
and get this.

00:30:04,485 --> 00:30:06,254
He did time in
a halfway house

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,688
after getting busted
for fentanyl.

00:30:07,755 --> 00:30:08,856
Which connects him

00:30:08,923 --> 00:30:11,526
to the fentanyl-dealing
sexagenarian, Penny Garden.

00:30:11,592 --> 00:30:13,728
Where's young Dell now?

00:30:17,532 --> 00:30:19,967
Lionel Dell?

00:30:22,003 --> 00:30:24,272
My name is Mitch Douglas.

00:30:24,338 --> 00:30:27,475
I'm Sara Sidle.
I'm with the Crime Lab.

00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:29,877
I was wondering
if you knew this woman.

00:30:29,944 --> 00:30:32,113
She used to sell fentanyl.

00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,183
Want me to pee in a cup?

00:30:36,717 --> 00:30:38,986
What about this guy?
He's dead, too.

00:30:39,053 --> 00:30:42,156
He was found face down in
a chicken stun bath in a place

00:30:42,223 --> 00:30:43,891
your dad used to work.

00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:46,460
He worked a lot of places.

00:30:47,528 --> 00:30:49,130
I met a lot of people.

00:30:51,365 --> 00:30:54,735
Did you know
Izzy Delancy?

00:30:54,802 --> 00:30:57,138
Yeah.

00:30:57,205 --> 00:30:59,774
His music sucks.

00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:03,778
What do all these stiffs got
to do with me?

00:31:03,845 --> 00:31:06,247
What was your relationship like
with your father?

00:31:06,314 --> 00:31:09,016
Before or after
he blew his brains out?

00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:11,919
Let's start with... before.

00:31:11,986 --> 00:31:16,090
You ever step in a pile of crap,
but you're wearing boots,

00:31:16,157 --> 00:31:17,992
so you can't just
scrape it off.

00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:20,127
You got to dig it
out with a stick,

00:31:20,194 --> 00:31:21,329
but even that
doesn't work,

00:31:21,395 --> 00:31:25,366
so you just end up
tossing the boots in the trash?

00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:27,802
It was kind of like that.

00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:29,504
And after?

00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,472
Much better.

00:31:33,007 --> 00:31:34,509
You gonna arrest me?

00:31:35,543 --> 00:31:37,612
We're just talking.

00:31:37,678 --> 00:31:39,680
I'm not.

00:32:03,538 --> 00:32:05,540
(knocking)

00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,844
Did you know Officer Kamen?

00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:11,512
No.

00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:13,581
Me, neither.

00:32:16,984 --> 00:32:20,288
I was watching her die,
and I didn't even realize it.

00:32:22,924 --> 00:32:25,693
Look, Sofia, there weren't
any carbon monoxide sensors

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,529
in the apartment,
so no one could have known.

00:32:28,596 --> 00:32:29,697
Yeah.

00:32:29,764 --> 00:32:32,033
And in fact,
if I hadn't have gone away,

00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:33,935
we'd have had another month
to work with;

00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:35,937
you'd have never been
in that position.

00:32:37,605 --> 00:32:41,809
It doesn't make you feel
any better either, does it?

00:32:46,347 --> 00:32:48,850
You know, the scene's
been released.

00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:51,219
Ms. Tallman was
pretty insistent.

00:32:51,285 --> 00:32:53,321
We offered
to leave a uniform with her,

00:32:53,387 --> 00:32:55,656
but she wasn't having it.

00:32:57,625 --> 00:33:01,195
So, what are
you looking for?

00:33:01,262 --> 00:33:03,531
The miniature's
complete.

00:33:03,598 --> 00:33:05,633
It's not perfect, though.

00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,136
Officer Kamen
was not the intended victim.

00:33:09,203 --> 00:33:11,339
Well, she was dressed like her.

00:33:11,405 --> 00:33:13,975
She died in the right position.

00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:15,610
So did the cat.

00:33:15,676 --> 00:33:18,045
I'm still not sure
it's perfect enough.

00:33:18,112 --> 00:33:20,548
(phone rings)

00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,718
Grissom.

00:33:23,784 --> 00:33:25,920
Yeah.

00:33:27,622 --> 00:33:30,458
Okay.

00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:36,597
Now, it's perfect.

00:33:41,068 --> 00:33:43,004
(camera shutter clicking)

00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,273
(garbled radio transmission)

00:33:45,339 --> 00:33:48,376
(camera shutter clicking)

00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:00,906
(camera shutter clicking)

00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,916
It's déjà vu all over again.

00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:13,285
Not entirely.

00:34:13,352 --> 00:34:15,120
There's some kind of liquid.

00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:16,655
It looks like it fell

00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:17,990
and splashes on the floor...

00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,825
on the body...

00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:21,326
and it looks like...

00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,929
the ear.

00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:31,236
This could be the source.

00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:34,172
WILLOWS:
<i>Killer returns to...</i>

00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,608
<i>complete the miniature</i>
<i>the old-fashioned way.</i>

00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:37,743
<i>And things get a little messy.</i>

00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,578
<i>But in the end...</i>

00:34:39,645 --> 00:34:42,848
he puts everything right back
where it belongs.

00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:46,451
TALLMAN:
<i>What happened to my sister</i>
<i>was not just some</i>

00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,820
isolated tragedy.

00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:51,189
There have been
four other murders,

00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:53,192
four deaths which could
have been prevented

00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,227
had the public been warned
by the people

00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:57,429
sworn to protect us.

00:34:57,496 --> 00:35:01,867
Barbara Tallman was the latest
victim of a serial killer...

00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:04,403
the LVPD has known about
for months.

00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:05,804
What do they call him?

00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:08,640
They call him
"The Miniature Killer,"

00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:12,044
because he makes little models
of his victims

00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,546
posed in the places
where they die.

00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:17,382
I feel for the guy, but he just
made our job a lot harder.

00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,084
It was inevitable.

00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:21,253
With each murder,
the amount of information

00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,322
that could leak rose
exponentially.

00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:25,157
TALLMAN:
I'm a private person,

00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:27,826
but if this prevents
just one tragedy,

00:35:27,893 --> 00:35:29,962
then it's worth it.

00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:34,933
Trace report on the
second crime scene or...

00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,535
or should I say second murder?

00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:38,003
Crime scene is the same.

00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,005
Haven't finished processing

00:35:40,072 --> 00:35:41,506
all the samples, but
the water from the vase

00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:44,276
is consistent with the water
found on the victim's clothing.

00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:46,311
There's chlorine bleach
in the samples.

00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:48,313
Why put bleach in vase water?

00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,048
I knew you'd ask that.

00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:53,185
Well, I had this girlfriend
who was a florist...

00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:55,587
The one with the water
retention problem.

00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,756
You remembered.

00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,491
Anyway...

00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:01,493
she said that if
you add a few drops of
bleach to your water,

00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,128
it kills bacteria,
and gives your flowers

00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:05,464
a nice long life,
but add too much...

00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:07,132
the flowers die.

00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,371
Grissom, we may have caught
a break on Barbara Tallman.

00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:14,907
She did pro bono work
at Lionel Dell's halfway house.

00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:19,044
Okay, so maybe I met her.
So what?

00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:21,547
CURTIS:
So, she's dead.

00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:25,584
That's four stiffs
associated with you, Lionel.

00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:29,688
Five, if you count Ernie.

00:36:29,755 --> 00:36:31,290
I don't.

00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,091
You know, you keep saying
that you hated your dad,

00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:34,626
but I'm not buying it.

00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,161
You go through your life alone.

00:36:36,228 --> 00:36:38,864
You're good with your hands.
You have weird hobbies.

00:36:38,931 --> 00:36:40,866
You make little things.

00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:42,467
And when that gets tricky...

00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:45,637
you call your father.

00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:49,041
CURTIS:
Maybe Ernie didn't know
you were a killer.

00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:51,877
Police start poking around,
asking questions,

00:36:51,944 --> 00:36:53,612
showing him pictures.

00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,881
And when Ernie sees these...

00:36:55,948 --> 00:36:59,851
he knows exactly
what his little boy's become.

00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:01,720
SIDLE:
To the rest of the
world, a monster,

00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:02,921
but to him...

00:37:02,988 --> 00:37:06,358
just a little boy knocking over
his birthday cake.

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,728
So he confesses to crimes
you committed,

00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:11,430
shoots himself in the head;
It's a dead end for us.

00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:13,465
New start for you.

00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:20,873
If only.

00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:23,709
Let me tell you about Ernie.

00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:27,246
What he cared about
in this life was...

00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,617
his wife, his trains,

00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:33,619
and his kids.

00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:35,287
In that order.

00:37:35,354 --> 00:37:38,290
Kids? You're an only child.

00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:41,260
Again, if only.

00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:44,963
If you're looking
for a love connection, then...

00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,165
then you should maybe go talk
to one of the chosen ones.

00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:48,734
What are you talking about?

00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,236
Fosters.

00:37:51,303 --> 00:37:54,506
My parents had, like... dozens.

00:37:54,573 --> 00:37:56,408
They'd come and go,

00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:58,176
some before I was born.

00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:00,646
My mom loved kids.

00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:03,048
Dad loved Mom.

00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:06,218
I guess as soon
as I came around...

00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:08,520
the love ran out.

00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:12,090
And then Mom dies...

00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:14,092
the kids leave...

00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,161
and Ernie's left with me.

00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,037
Ernie didn't take a bullet
for me.

00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:30,809
But it's a beautiful thought.

00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:36,181
I pulled these fibers
out of her nasal passages.

00:38:37,216 --> 00:38:38,850
Well,they appear
to be consistent

00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:41,019
with the sofa pillow cushion
at the scene.

00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:43,188
COD was asphyxiation.

00:38:43,255 --> 00:38:44,856
Now...

00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:48,427
what is wrong with this brain?

00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,796
Other than the fact
that it's out of its skull?

00:38:50,863 --> 00:38:52,998
Pigmentation's unusual.

00:38:53,065 --> 00:38:55,300
Bingo... or keno
or whatever you prefer.

00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:57,536
Pronounced lack
of pigmentation

00:38:57,603 --> 00:39:00,706
near the midbrain,
along with...

00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:03,242
clearly diminished
substantia nigra.

00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:04,643
She had Parkinson's.

00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:09,481
Nick and Warrick did say
that she was a little...

00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:12,651
spacey when they met her, but
they didn't mention any shaking.

00:39:12,718 --> 00:39:14,620
Her disease was advanced.

00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,154
She was on
some pretty heavy meds.

00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:18,290
Would they have shown up
on a poison tox panel?

00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:20,292
No, but those kinds
of medications

00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:23,195
can cause
abnormal thinking and behavior.

00:39:23,262 --> 00:39:25,163
Takes somebody with a very

00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,866
strong will to keep it hidden.

00:39:29,635 --> 00:39:32,037
WILLOWS:
Hey!

00:39:32,104 --> 00:39:34,106
How'd it go with the Sheriff?

00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,942
Media's all over him.

00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:38,544
Which means he's all
over the Undersheriff,

00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,412
who's all over Ecklie,

00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:42,581
who's blaming me
for not going public

00:39:42,648 --> 00:39:44,983
with the Izzy Delancy Miniature
like he told me to.

00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,220
Well, I got the final trace
report on the bleach water

00:39:48,287 --> 00:39:51,723
that spilled at
the scene, but...

00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:54,293
the fluid in the ear
was biological.

00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:55,994
Water and proteins.

00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:59,631
Lipocalin, lactoferrin,
lysozyme.

00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:01,366
Tears.

00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:02,534
Mm-hmm.

00:40:02,601 --> 00:40:04,803
The victim was crying?

00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,039
The smudges are from the pillow.
There were no tear tracks.

00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:09,508
I don't think
the victim was crying.

00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:11,944
I think the killer was.

00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,885
WILLOWS:
<i>When you cry,</i>

00:40:19,952 --> 00:40:24,623
<i>your tears sometimes can pick</i>
<i>up skin cells from your cheek.</i>

00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:31,630
The DNA in your tears

00:40:31,697 --> 00:40:34,499
that were found on your sister's
body prove that you were there.

00:40:36,368 --> 00:40:39,137
I imagine it was the hardest
thing you've ever done.

00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:42,107
But you did it.

00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:46,612
You should've seen Barbara
when she was young.

00:40:50,082 --> 00:40:52,517
She was fierce.

00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:55,487
And fearless.

00:40:55,554 --> 00:40:58,023
She protected me.

00:41:00,058 --> 00:41:03,095
She was the smartest,
the funniest,

00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:06,532
best friend I could ask for
in life.

00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:13,705
The Parkinson's just robbed her
of everything.

00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:15,374
She'd take medication;
she'd go away.

00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,842
She'd get off medication.

00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:20,445
She'd become lucid again,
only in agony.

00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:26,685
She wanted to die
in her own home.

00:41:26,752 --> 00:41:32,257
There's no... assisted suicide
protection in Nevada.

00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:35,360
She said this was
the perfect opportunity.

00:41:35,427 --> 00:41:37,930
She could get what she wanted,
and...

00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,699
everyone would blame
the Miniature Killer.

00:41:40,766 --> 00:41:42,367
I understand.

00:41:44,803 --> 00:41:47,239
You're under arrest.

00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:02,888
We reran the footage several
times to get a head count.

00:42:02,955 --> 00:42:05,691
Assuming that they're
all Dell foster kids,

00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:07,860
there's 13 of them.

00:42:07,926 --> 00:42:11,330
At this birthday party?
Yeah.

00:42:11,396 --> 00:42:13,332
Lionel only remembered
the first names,

00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:15,200
and only a few of those.

00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:17,636
Getting the DHS records
is going to be tough.

00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:19,404
Judges hate giving them out

00:42:19,471 --> 00:42:21,573
unless we can demonstrate
a pressing need...

00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,575
and even then,
they're spotty.

00:42:23,642 --> 00:42:27,145
And a lot of a foster kids
change their names
when they age out.

00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:30,315
Ernie Dell confessed
and killed himself

00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:32,651
to protect someone
that he loved.

00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:34,720
And that someone
has murdered five people.

00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:38,090
Eenie, meeny, miney, mo.

00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:41,927
Catch a monster by the toe.
