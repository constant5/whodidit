00:00:44,904 --> 00:00:47,506
(bed springs squeaking)

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,219
MAN:
Yeah. One of the gals fished him
out of the pool,

00:01:00,286 --> 00:01:01,888
and the owner called me.

00:01:01,954 --> 00:01:03,489
No one's touched the body since.

00:01:03,556 --> 00:01:04,657
Where's your coroner?

00:01:04,724 --> 00:01:06,025
Oh, couldn't get him
on the horn.

00:01:06,092 --> 00:01:07,560
Probably out in some barn,

00:01:07,627 --> 00:01:09,495
up to his elbows
in a cow's vagina.

00:01:09,562 --> 00:01:11,163
Excuse me?

00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,767
Oh. Yeah. Coroner's a part-time
gig here in Brime County.

00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:16,736
He's a veterinarian.
That's his money gig.

00:01:16,802 --> 00:01:18,771
Control,
this is CSI Sidle.

00:01:18,838 --> 00:01:20,273
We're going to need
a coroner for that 419

00:01:20,339 --> 00:01:23,709
out at the
Sugar Cane Ranch.

00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:27,213
(overlapping chatter)

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,650
This is a strange crowd
for a cathouse.

00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:31,884
MAN:
Hey, Sheriff!

00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:34,120
Di-Did you hear about my wife?

00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:35,755
Somebody shot my wife.
Yeah.

00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:38,758
No, I'm telling ya,
they shot my wife.

00:01:38,824 --> 00:01:40,293
Yeah. Okay. All right.
Okay. All right.

00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,461
Settle down, Milton.
Settle down. Okay.

00:01:42,528 --> 00:01:45,498
His wife died about
ten years ago of a stroke.

00:01:45,565 --> 00:01:48,201
What is with all
the old-timers
out here tonight?

00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:49,435
Oh, they live here.

00:01:49,502 --> 00:01:50,903
Yeah, all over these hills.

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,738
Cheap rents,
abundant sunshine...

00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:55,541
Life is good here
in Brime County.

00:01:58,844 --> 00:02:02,982
Guy's name
is Lorenzo Morales.

00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:04,817
"Happy" Morales.

00:02:04,884 --> 00:02:07,253
I saw him fight LeRoi Steele
at the Sands a couple

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,588
of years ago.

00:02:08,654 --> 00:02:09,956
Took a vicious beating.

00:02:10,022 --> 00:02:11,490
Never touched the mat once.

00:02:11,557 --> 00:02:14,327
Well, he's definitely
down for the count.

00:02:14,393 --> 00:02:15,695
Listen. I want
to tell you something.

00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,129
George and Doris Babinkian
own this place.

00:02:17,196 --> 00:02:18,564
Run a real tight ship.

00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:20,900
Never had a problem
in all the years
they've been here.

00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:22,068
Just good people.

00:02:22,134 --> 00:02:23,736
Pay their taxes,
provide employment,

00:02:23,803 --> 00:02:25,471
Pillars of
the community.

00:02:25,538 --> 00:02:27,240
You know, last month
actually, they had a...

00:02:27,306 --> 00:02:30,643
Ned, you left this
in my room again.

00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,946
Oh. Thanks. Thanks, Aimee.

00:02:34,013 --> 00:02:36,282
She...

00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,792
Look at this.

00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:48,494
Gunshot wound?

00:02:48,561 --> 00:02:49,662
Maybe.

00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:54,467
He's got a contusion
over his right eye.

00:02:54,534 --> 00:02:56,369
Could be associated
with the incident.

00:02:56,435 --> 00:02:58,704
Well, he was a boxer.

00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:07,146
Feels like bathwater.

00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:08,648
It's got to be 90 degrees.

00:03:08,714 --> 00:03:10,850
There's no way we're going
to get an accurate T.O.D.

00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:13,586
Places like this
always keep their pools warm.

00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:16,222
Encourages the girls
to swim topless.

00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:17,723
It's good
for business.

00:03:18,724 --> 00:03:21,694

So when was the last time
you saw the deceased?

00:04:16,786 --> 00:04:18,521
It was, like,
an hour ago,

00:04:18,588 --> 00:04:21,357
when they took him
away on that cart.

00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:22,925
(chuckling):
No, I...

00:04:22,992 --> 00:04:25,728
you know, I meant the last time
you saw him alive.

00:04:25,795 --> 00:04:27,797
I saw him around
noon yesterday.

00:04:27,864 --> 00:04:30,967
Made him his
favorite meal. Meat.

00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:33,136
Yeah. Mr. Babinkian...

00:04:33,202 --> 00:04:35,104
Oh, you call me Binky.
Everybody call me Binky.

00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:37,507
Okay, Binky, tell me about...
Lorenzo?

00:04:37,573 --> 00:04:39,575
Everybody call him Happy.
Mm-hmm.

00:04:39,642 --> 00:04:41,177
What? Does everybody
have a nickname around here?

00:04:41,244 --> 00:04:43,846
Not me. I'm just Doris. Nut?

00:04:43,913 --> 00:04:45,815
No, thank you, Doris.

00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:47,817
So tell me about Happy.
BINKY:
Oh, Happy, Happy.

00:04:47,884 --> 00:04:49,452
He was a fighter.

00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:51,187
He was a born boxer.

00:04:51,254 --> 00:04:52,655
He had speed,
he had skills,

00:04:52,722 --> 00:04:55,658
he had heart,
he had... punch!

00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:59,162
You know, four years ago, he was
a top-ranked middleweight.

00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:01,964
That's right.
Yeah. But he... I don't know...

00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:03,800
stumble into hard times.

00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:05,301
Oh, yeah? What do you mean?

00:05:05,368 --> 00:05:08,271
You know. Boompa, boompa
sniff, sniff. Like, party time.

00:05:08,337 --> 00:05:12,642
And I... I mean,
I buy his contract,

00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,011
I take him out here,
I give him a double-wide.

00:05:15,078 --> 00:05:17,180
I build him a gym to train him,
and I train him.

00:05:17,246 --> 00:05:19,615
I can make him a champion.

00:05:19,682 --> 00:05:20,883
He did that.

00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,385
You took a boxer
who likes to party

00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:24,454
to a whorehouse to train?
Do you think that was smart?

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,357
Well, in hindsight,
maybe not so good idea.

00:05:28,424 --> 00:05:30,726
So, anybody have a grudge
against Happy that you know of?

00:05:30,793 --> 00:05:33,396
(mutters)
Everybody loved Happy.

00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:35,331
Yes.

00:05:35,398 --> 00:05:36,666
You...

00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:38,367
I want you to catch

00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:39,736
this person.

00:05:39,802 --> 00:05:42,171
Find him, please.

00:05:42,238 --> 00:05:45,575
And, you know...

00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:48,277
anytime your boys need a break,

00:05:48,344 --> 00:05:51,013
we have something here
we call a cop special.

00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,715
You'll like it.
Any girl,

00:05:52,782 --> 00:05:54,584
no charge

00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,086
and one complimentary drink...

00:05:57,153 --> 00:05:59,388
Oh, two!

00:05:59,455 --> 00:06:01,324
Okay, two complimentary drinks.

00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,059
And one appetizer

00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:04,627
of your choice here at the bar.

00:06:04,694 --> 00:06:06,829
Tonight, we have, uh...?
Baba ghanoush.

00:06:06,896 --> 00:06:08,030
Yes.

00:06:08,097 --> 00:06:09,365
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

00:06:09,432 --> 00:06:11,601
You two really run 
a mom-and-pop operation.

00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:14,370
(laughing):
Oh, thank you.

00:06:14,437 --> 00:06:16,072
And now, if you don't mind, I'd
like to talk to the hookers.

00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:19,208
Hooking is what girls do
out on the street.

00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:22,478
Here we prefer the term
"pleasure provider."

00:06:25,348 --> 00:06:29,685
Ooh! Beer caps, candy wrappers,
cigarette butts, used condoms.

00:06:29,752 --> 00:06:33,189
This is one
pool I am not

00:06:33,256 --> 00:06:36,426
feeling a pressing need
to take a dip in.

00:06:36,492 --> 00:06:38,094
Ugh. Me either.

00:06:38,161 --> 00:06:40,863
This chair has
taken quite a beating,

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,131
and this cigarette
looks like

00:06:42,198 --> 00:06:43,599
it was just left here
and burned out.

00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,635
Hand me an evidence marker,
will you?

00:06:49,338 --> 00:06:52,975
There is a stain on the filter.

00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:55,812
Could be blood,
could be lipstick.

00:06:55,878 --> 00:06:57,880
If this fellow was shot
through the throat,

00:06:57,947 --> 00:07:00,483
and had a nasty lump
on the head,

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,288
<i>could be how he ended up</i>
<i>face down in the pool.</i>

00:07:05,354 --> 00:07:07,957
Yeah, but there's no blood
by the pool.

00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:09,659
If he was shot shot here,
you'd expect spatter.

00:07:09,725 --> 00:07:12,628
Back-splash could
have washed it away

00:07:12,695 --> 00:07:13,763
when he hit the water.

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,765
I kind of doubt it.

00:07:15,832 --> 00:07:17,867
The bloodstains on his shirt
were straight up and down.

00:07:17,934 --> 00:07:19,669
They had time to settle in.

00:07:19,736 --> 00:07:22,472
I think
he was shot somewhere else,

00:07:22,538 --> 00:07:24,640
and just got dumped in here.

00:07:24,707 --> 00:07:28,411
Well, it sounds like we need
to play...

00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:30,947
"Find the Bullet."

00:07:35,618 --> 00:07:38,955
All right. Open up, please.

00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:40,990
Honey, come see me later.

00:07:41,057 --> 00:07:43,126
I can show you a better way
to get DNA.

00:07:43,192 --> 00:07:46,195
(women laughing)

00:07:48,097 --> 00:07:50,833
BRASS:
So did you see Lorenzo
"Happy" Morales last night?

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,101
Uh-uh.

00:07:52,168 --> 00:07:53,202
No.

00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:54,203
I don't think so.

00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,972
No?
No.

00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:58,040
Mm... Mm-mm.

00:07:58,107 --> 00:08:00,276
Did you hear any gunshots?
Any shouting? Anything unusual?

00:08:00,343 --> 00:08:02,512
No.

00:08:02,578 --> 00:08:03,880
No.

00:08:05,748 --> 00:08:07,850
So what did you do last night?

00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:10,453
A guy came in, and he brought
his 18-year-old son,

00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,822
and I made him a man.

00:08:13,856 --> 00:08:15,391
I popped his man cherry.

00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,526
Oh, the usual stuff.

00:08:16,592 --> 00:08:17,760
I had a pretty good night.

00:08:17,827 --> 00:08:19,562
I tided a guy.

00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:20,997
That's it?

00:08:21,064 --> 00:08:22,365
I had a cold,

00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:25,068
so I stayed in my room
and I read <i>Pride and Prejudice.</i>

00:08:25,134 --> 00:08:26,202
(chuckles)

00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:28,871
I have a big fat crush
on Mr. Darcy.

00:08:28,938 --> 00:08:33,076
I had two... no, three dates.

00:08:33,142 --> 00:08:36,813
Then I hung around the bar
and watched TV.

00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,748
So, what did you think of Happy?

00:08:38,815 --> 00:08:40,049
He was fine.

00:08:40,116 --> 00:08:41,818
Actually, he was kind of...

00:08:41,884 --> 00:08:43,086
Cute.

00:08:43,152 --> 00:08:45,888
And he was...

00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:48,224
I mean, I didn't
have nothing against him.

00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,892
Let me make something
clear for you.

00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:51,627
This is a homicide
investigation.

00:08:51,694 --> 00:08:53,463
If you're lying to me,
even a little bit,

00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:55,565
I'm going to come down on you
like a load of bricks.

00:08:55,631 --> 00:08:57,467
So let me
ask you again.

00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:59,001
What did you think of Happy?

00:09:03,072 --> 00:09:05,041
He was messed up, man.

00:09:05,108 --> 00:09:09,378
He took pills to get wood,
then he couldn't even finish.

00:09:09,445 --> 00:09:11,047
Plus, he had the windy problem.

00:09:11,114 --> 00:09:13,483
What does that mean?
He talked too much?

00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:15,885
No. He passed gas too much.

00:09:15,952 --> 00:09:18,054
He smelled really bad.

00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:19,322
I mean, I know
you're not supposed

00:09:19,388 --> 00:09:20,656
to be sensitive
in this line of work...

00:09:20,723 --> 00:09:22,825
But that guy
could blister paint.

00:09:22,892 --> 00:09:25,027
Wow.
What pissed me off,

00:09:25,094 --> 00:09:26,295
he started coming around,

00:09:26,362 --> 00:09:28,698
and he just stopped
paying for it.

00:09:28,765 --> 00:09:31,501
He thought he could get anything
and everything for free.

00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:34,237
So, did Doris and Binky
have a problem with this?

00:09:34,303 --> 00:09:37,373
<i>Binky had a big problem</i>
<i>with it.</i>

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,342
You keep your hands
off my girls.

00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:40,343
Okay?

00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,278
Hey, this is a whorehouse.

00:09:42,345 --> 00:09:43,780
That's what they're here for.

00:09:43,846 --> 00:09:46,015
You lazy, fat bum.

00:09:46,082 --> 00:09:48,684
Why you don't make yourself
useful around here, eh?

00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:53,890
Look at this piece of falling
apart crap of a chair.

00:09:53,956 --> 00:09:55,625
You pick up a tool
and fix it!

00:09:55,691 --> 00:09:57,326
All right?

00:09:59,395 --> 00:10:00,696
(burps)

00:10:00,763 --> 00:10:05,134
Doris, uh... she had
a little thing for Mr. Happy,

00:10:05,201 --> 00:10:06,636
if you know what I mean.

00:10:06,702 --> 00:10:07,904
Did he reciprocate?

00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,906
What?
Was it a
one-way thing

00:10:09,972 --> 00:10:11,541
or a two-way thing?

00:10:11,607 --> 00:10:13,109
I don't know what you're saying.

00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:14,710
Did Binky know?

00:10:14,777 --> 00:10:17,480
I don't know.

00:10:17,547 --> 00:10:18,948
May I?

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,659
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

00:10:32,562 --> 00:10:35,498
These monitors
are live-feed only?

00:10:35,565 --> 00:10:38,101
Nothing taped?
Absolutely not.

00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:39,368
If we did that,
and word got out,

00:10:39,435 --> 00:10:40,670
we'd be out of business

00:10:40,737 --> 00:10:42,472
in about a week.

00:10:42,538 --> 00:10:46,943
But I see that the rooms
are wired for sound as well.

00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:48,745
Yeah. Well, that's
for the girls' protection.

00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:51,080
And to make sure that
they don't short you

00:10:51,147 --> 00:10:52,615
on their financial
transactions?

00:10:52,682 --> 00:10:54,851
I just spot-check
from time to time.

00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:56,252
I trust my girls.

00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:58,454
Did you hear
anything unusual last night?

00:10:58,521 --> 00:11:00,723
Believe me,
if I had heard anything,

00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,024
you'd have known
about it already.

00:11:02,091 --> 00:11:03,092
I want to know

00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:05,495
what happened to that poor boy
just as much...

00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:07,263
just as as much as anybody.

00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,531
You cared about him.

00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:12,435
Happy was a child
in a man's body, you know?

00:11:12,502 --> 00:11:13,970
He had no family.

00:11:14,036 --> 00:11:16,139
He had nobody.

00:11:16,205 --> 00:11:17,640
He was scared.

00:11:17,707 --> 00:11:18,908
His big comeback
was going nowhere.

00:11:18,975 --> 00:11:20,376
He was finished,
and he knew it.

00:11:20,443 --> 00:11:23,346
Happy knew it. Binky knew it.
Everybody knew it.

00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:27,083
25 people here last
night, and nobody
sees anything.

00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,851
Nice hat, honey.

00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:32,188
So you've been to a place
like this before?

00:11:32,255 --> 00:11:34,557
I worked a murder-suicide
at the Naughty Kitty once.

00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:35,625
No, no, come on.

00:11:35,691 --> 00:11:36,826
You know what I mean.

00:11:36,893 --> 00:11:38,895
As a customer? No.

00:11:38,961 --> 00:11:40,530
You never paid for sex?

00:11:40,596 --> 00:11:41,564
I have not.

00:11:41,631 --> 00:11:44,434
I find the whole idea
very... bleak.

00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,501
Really?

00:11:45,568 --> 00:11:47,036
How come?

00:11:47,103 --> 00:11:48,037
Sex should provide

00:11:48,104 --> 00:11:49,572
the opportunity
for human connection,

00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:51,207
but paid sex does
the opposite of that.

00:11:51,274 --> 00:11:57,046
To me, sex without love
is pointless.

00:11:57,113 --> 00:11:59,015
It makes you sad.

00:11:59,082 --> 00:12:01,584
Well, I'm pretty sure
I don't make you sad.

00:12:01,651 --> 00:12:05,054
No. You make me happy.

00:12:30,546 --> 00:12:31,914
Methaqualone...

00:12:31,981 --> 00:12:36,285
benzodiazepine; antidepressants.

00:12:36,352 --> 00:12:37,653
Anabolic steroids,
beta blockers,

00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,523
high-blood-pressure meds,

00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,091
Prevalis.

00:12:42,158 --> 00:12:44,260
There's no prescription labels.
It's all written in Spanish.

00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:47,363
Looks like a lot of this stuff
came from south of the border.

00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,868
Blood drops on the floor.

00:12:53,803 --> 00:12:55,671
Smears on the furniture
and the walls.

00:12:58,074 --> 00:13:00,676
This might be where
they ran the opening bell.

00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:08,584
ROBBINS:
Boxers all end up
the same,

00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:10,920
beaten, broken
and forgotten.

00:13:10,987 --> 00:13:14,857
BROWN:
Hmm, yeah, Joe Louis,
George Foreman,

00:13:14,924 --> 00:13:18,294
Ali, Marciano,
Frazier, Tyson.

00:13:18,361 --> 00:13:19,462
Who are those guys?

00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:24,033
Whoa.

00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,002
Genitals are distended

00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:28,604
and patchy and covered
with large red welts.

00:13:28,671 --> 00:13:31,541
Testicles are swollen,

00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:35,011
roughly three times
the average size.

00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:37,380
Scrotum is filled
with fluid.

00:13:37,447 --> 00:13:41,284
It's consistent
with cardio edema or an STD.

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,686
Maybe an infection of some kind.

00:13:43,753 --> 00:13:45,655
Either that or this guy's got
the world's ugliest Johnson.

00:13:46,923 --> 00:13:50,259
Okay, I'll just slice
the scrotal sack

00:13:50,326 --> 00:13:51,994
and draw out
a fluid sample.

00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:54,797
Oh, Doc, could you wait
till I leave? Thanks.

00:13:54,864 --> 00:13:57,800
This guy's got a nasty crack
on his head.

00:13:57,867 --> 00:13:59,969
Yeah. Probably a fracture.

00:14:00,036 --> 00:14:01,104
Wouldn't surprise me

00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,040
if there was a hematoma
to go along with it.

00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,211
There's linear markings
on the contusion.

00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,515
(device beeps)

00:14:12,582 --> 00:14:14,484
BROWN:
Looks like letters of some kind.

00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,018
What is that?

00:14:17,653 --> 00:14:20,323
I think it's backwards.

00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:23,793
I-N-C-H.

00:14:26,262 --> 00:14:27,530
BINKY:
Please, listen.

00:14:27,597 --> 00:14:31,100
You make me close down my
doors, cop cars in front!

00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,969
It's not good
for the business.

00:14:33,035 --> 00:14:36,272
I know a man die here,
but dead is dead.

00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:37,540
I lose my shirt.

00:14:37,607 --> 00:14:39,308
Are the girls allowed
to keep any weapons

00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,043
in the room
for self-defense?

00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,578
No weapons.
Strictly forbidden.

00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:44,714
Then you won't mind
if I check for myself, right?

00:14:44,781 --> 00:14:46,282
What do you mean,
check for yourself?

00:14:46,349 --> 00:14:47,950
How long will
this take?

00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:49,919
As long as it takes.

00:14:49,986 --> 00:14:51,854
(mocking):
As long as it takes.

00:14:53,823 --> 00:14:58,327
Your mother sleep
with Azerbaijani.

00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:27,690
(zapping)

00:15:55,818 --> 00:15:58,621
BRASS:
<i>Dreama Little.</i>

00:15:58,688 --> 00:16:02,125
Is that your real name?

00:16:02,191 --> 00:16:08,765
♪ Stars shining
bright above you ♪

00:16:08,831 --> 00:16:14,504
♪ Night breezes
seem to whisper "I love you" ♪

00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:19,742
♪ Birds singing in
the sycamore tree ♪

00:16:21,677 --> 00:16:26,516
♪ Dream a little dream of me. ♪

00:16:26,582 --> 00:16:29,419
Do I look
like Paula Abdul to you?

00:16:31,454 --> 00:16:35,224
My daddy gave me that name
'cause he liked that song.

00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,529
All right.

00:16:39,595 --> 00:16:41,464
Happy was hit
in the head with a crowbar

00:16:41,531 --> 00:16:42,999
we found in your room.

00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:44,400
You wiped off your fingerprints,

00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:47,036
but you didn't wipe off
his blood from the grooves.

00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:51,741
He was always...
coming up to my room,

00:16:51,808 --> 00:16:54,977
getting all up on me.

00:16:55,044 --> 00:16:56,846
He liked them
other girls,

00:16:56,913 --> 00:17:01,350
but he was obsessed with me.

00:17:03,086 --> 00:17:05,455
Look, look what he did.

00:17:05,521 --> 00:17:07,223
He punched me right there
in the ribs

00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,758
just for fun.

00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:11,160
Stupid. Then he flipped me over

00:17:11,227 --> 00:17:12,895
and then he started punching me
back here.

00:17:12,962 --> 00:17:16,532
Every night, drunk, crazy,
messed up.

00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,869
Whether he could get it up
or not.

00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:23,106
<i>Last night I was just about</i>
<i>to take my week off to bleed,</i>

00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:24,941
<i>and I wasn't in the mood.</i>

00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:26,275
No!

00:17:26,342 --> 00:17:28,878
(gasps)
grunts)

00:17:29,979 --> 00:17:31,748
<i>So yeah...</i>

00:17:31,814 --> 00:17:33,382
(groans)

00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:35,051
<i>...I hit him.</i>

00:17:37,987 --> 00:17:39,655
So what?

00:17:39,722 --> 00:17:41,958
He deserved it.

00:17:42,024 --> 00:17:44,560
It didn't even drop him.

00:17:44,627 --> 00:17:46,095
He just wandered off.

00:17:46,162 --> 00:17:48,965
I'm going to let you in
on a little secret.

00:17:49,031 --> 00:17:50,032
You don't get to decide

00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:51,434
whether you kill somebody
or not.

00:17:51,501 --> 00:17:53,636
I just explained to you...

00:17:53,703 --> 00:17:55,471
You whacked him on the side
of the head with a crowbar.

00:17:55,538 --> 00:17:57,607
I know, but I didn't...
He came over...

00:17:57,673 --> 00:17:58,941
That's assault
with a deadly weapon.

00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:01,010
It doesn't matter whether
he wandered off or not.

00:18:01,077 --> 00:18:02,311
He's bleeding from the brain.

00:18:02,378 --> 00:18:05,314
If he dies later on,
that's murder on you.

00:18:08,651 --> 00:18:10,987
I killed him?

00:18:11,053 --> 00:18:13,556
You know, a jury may take into
account the fact that you

00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:15,658
were abused,
and I hope they do.

00:18:15,725 --> 00:18:17,760
But you're not gonna
just walk out of here.

00:18:17,827 --> 00:18:19,796
(sobbing)

00:18:19,862 --> 00:18:22,732
I killed him!

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,334
You know, sometimes

00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:27,403
it helps

00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,172
to write it down.

00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:32,341
Okay.

00:18:32,408 --> 00:18:34,644
(phone rings)

00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:44,787
Yes.

00:18:44,854 --> 00:18:46,456
I understand you're going
to be talking

00:18:46,522 --> 00:18:49,192
to the girl
who crowbarred the boxer.

00:18:49,258 --> 00:18:51,260
(whispering):
Well, yes, Doctor,

00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:53,663
I'm actually with her right now.

00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,697
Yeah, well, actually

00:18:54,764 --> 00:18:56,766
I'm with him right now,

00:18:56,833 --> 00:19:00,303
and that blow to the head
didn't do him much good,

00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:05,041
but it's definitely
not what killed him.

00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:14,968
The blow to the forehead
caused bruising

00:19:15,035 --> 00:19:16,236
to the right frontal lobe.

00:19:16,303 --> 00:19:17,838
It's significant,

00:19:17,904 --> 00:19:19,573
but definitely
sub-lethal by itself.

00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,074
And what are those gray spots?

00:19:21,141 --> 00:19:22,709
Just old scar tissue.

00:19:22,776 --> 00:19:24,845
See it on boxers
all the time.

00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:27,681
It's impossible to know
what kind of brain damage

00:19:27,748 --> 00:19:29,549
the guy was already living with.

00:19:29,616 --> 00:19:31,852
So what killed him?

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,086
In addition to
the brain trauma

00:19:33,153 --> 00:19:34,922
and the holes in his throat,
he has needle marks.

00:19:34,988 --> 00:19:37,257
on his thighs,
arms and buttocks.

00:19:37,324 --> 00:19:39,226
I don't know for certain
what he was shooting up.

00:19:39,293 --> 00:19:40,594
Still waiting for tox.

00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:43,530
Well, he was found floating
facedown in a pool,

00:19:43,597 --> 00:19:44,865
so let's start with the obvious.

00:19:44,932 --> 00:19:46,166
Any evidence of drowning?

00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:49,169
His lungs were partially filled
with blood and water.

00:19:49,236 --> 00:19:53,840
However, the neck
wound transected

00:19:53,907 --> 00:19:58,579
the trachea below
the epiglottis.

00:19:58,645 --> 00:20:00,013
So the air
and the water

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,249
could have entered
passively postmortem.

00:20:02,316 --> 00:20:04,985
Well, the entry and the exit
are the same size, but...

00:20:05,052 --> 00:20:07,788
it doesn't look like
a bullet wound to me.

00:20:07,854 --> 00:20:09,957
No, it seems more like a
straight-through puncture.

00:20:10,023 --> 00:20:11,892
The bruising here

00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:14,127
is more developed
than here.

00:20:14,194 --> 00:20:16,096
At this point, all
I can say for sure

00:20:16,163 --> 00:20:19,399
is the neck wound occurred
before the blow to the head.

00:20:40,053 --> 00:20:43,624
(distant police radio
transmission)

00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,559
Okay.

00:20:45,626 --> 00:20:47,027
Hey.

00:20:47,094 --> 00:20:50,264
Catherine said we might not be
looking for a bullet anymore.

00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,099
She happen to say
what we are looking for?

00:20:52,165 --> 00:20:53,900
Not a bullet.

00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:56,203
Well, it looks like we have
blood drops

00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,638
heading towards Happy's trailer.

00:20:57,704 --> 00:20:59,573
Mm-hmm.
MILTON:
Hey!

00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,343
You kids, you caught your,
caught your guy?

00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,745
No, sir.

00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:06,413
You going to catch him?

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,315
We certainly hope so.
Well,

00:21:08,382 --> 00:21:14,187
think this might be
of some help?

00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:23,130
I told you,
somebody shot my wife.

00:21:23,196 --> 00:21:24,731
Come in. I'll show you.

00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:32,105
There is what appears
to be blood

00:21:32,172 --> 00:21:33,307
on the shaft.

00:21:33,373 --> 00:21:34,341
I told 'em.

00:21:34,408 --> 00:21:35,943
I told 'em,
but would they listen?

00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:37,044
No, no,

00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:40,547
just an old man
running off at the mouth.

00:21:40,614 --> 00:21:41,782
Did you see this happen?

00:21:41,848 --> 00:21:43,784
No. Woke up

00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:47,187
this morning and found it 
like that.

00:21:47,254 --> 00:21:50,023
I shot an arrow into the air,

00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,126
and it fell to Earth
I know not where.

00:21:53,193 --> 00:21:56,229
Oh, so swiftly it flew,

00:21:56,296 --> 00:22:01,735
the sight could not follow it
in its flight.

00:22:01,802 --> 00:22:03,170
Long, long...

00:22:03,236 --> 00:22:04,171
Sir.

00:22:04,237 --> 00:22:05,639
That's,

00:22:05,706 --> 00:22:07,140
that's really sweet.

00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:08,609
That's Longfellow.

00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:12,246
(chuckling):
What do you kids know
about poetry?

00:22:12,312 --> 00:22:15,415
Nick, arrow came in
through that window.

00:22:17,918 --> 00:22:20,687
Yeah.

00:22:20,754 --> 00:22:23,390
Even an idiot could see that.

00:22:54,187 --> 00:22:57,991
♪ ♪

00:23:23,884 --> 00:23:25,886
(whooshing)

00:23:27,688 --> 00:23:29,489
Hey, Sara.

00:23:29,556 --> 00:23:31,558
Found another arrow
shot in the ground

00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,560
near that old tool shed.

00:23:33,627 --> 00:23:34,695
Maybe the shooter got nervous.

00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:36,063
Well, to work
in a brothel

00:23:36,129 --> 00:23:39,166
you're required to register
your fingerprints, so...

00:23:39,232 --> 00:23:41,101
I'm almost done here.
I'll catch up.
Okay.

00:23:41,168 --> 00:23:42,936
I'll let you know
if we get lucky.

00:23:43,003 --> 00:23:44,471
A long time afterward,

00:23:44,538 --> 00:23:47,441
in an oak

00:23:47,507 --> 00:23:49,810
I found the arrow,
still unbroke

00:23:49,876 --> 00:23:53,046
And the song, from
beginning to end,

00:23:53,113 --> 00:23:55,449
I found again in the heart

00:23:55,515 --> 00:23:57,985
of a friend.

00:23:58,051 --> 00:24:00,354
Keep the faith, Milton.

00:24:15,535 --> 00:24:16,570
(beeps)

00:24:29,283 --> 00:24:31,285
(beeping)

00:24:36,189 --> 00:24:38,191
(beeping)

00:24:52,372 --> 00:24:53,707
Connor.

00:24:53,774 --> 00:24:56,677
Honey, are you asleep?

00:24:56,743 --> 00:24:58,478
Connor.

00:25:01,081 --> 00:25:02,683
Hello, Doris.

00:25:02,749 --> 00:25:04,551
Are you drunk?

00:25:06,219 --> 00:25:07,888
No.

00:25:07,955 --> 00:25:09,856
Not too much.

00:25:09,923 --> 00:25:11,692
What's up, dude?

00:25:11,758 --> 00:25:13,927
Mr. Foster, we're going to need
to talk to you

00:25:13,994 --> 00:25:15,329
down at the police station.

00:25:15,395 --> 00:25:17,164
Okay?

00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,832
Okey-doke.

00:25:24,371 --> 00:25:26,907
(mutters)

00:25:27,941 --> 00:25:29,943
CONNOR:
<i>Okay...</i>

00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,379
(voice breaking):
so I shot Happy.

00:25:32,446 --> 00:25:34,348
I hated that guy.

00:25:34,414 --> 00:25:36,917
But it was self-defense.

00:25:36,984 --> 00:25:39,553
Self-defense,
really? How?

00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:44,024
I myself was trying
to defend the girls.

00:25:44,091 --> 00:25:46,326
They needed me to protect them.

00:25:46,393 --> 00:25:48,028
They depended me on that.

00:25:48,095 --> 00:25:49,896
So that's what I done.

00:25:51,498 --> 00:25:53,100
(whispering):
This guy was a monster!

00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:55,369
(shrieks)

00:25:55,435 --> 00:25:57,571
(gasping, panting)

00:25:57,638 --> 00:26:00,707
<i>He was all puffed up...</i>

00:26:00,774 --> 00:26:04,111
like some big-ass...

00:26:04,177 --> 00:26:06,480
lizard monster guy.

00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,219
(grunts)

00:26:12,286 --> 00:26:14,621
(wheezing, gasping breaths)

00:26:22,462 --> 00:26:23,764
(groans)

00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,499
(wheezing,
gasping breaths)

00:26:29,202 --> 00:26:30,270
(whimpering)

00:26:30,337 --> 00:26:31,571
(sighs)

00:26:31,638 --> 00:26:33,840
So this is your idea
of an assassination attempt?

00:26:33,907 --> 00:26:35,175
This is your Lee Harvey?

00:26:35,242 --> 00:26:37,344
You hide behind a
tool shed and shoot him

00:26:37,411 --> 00:26:40,681
with a crossbow, which we all
know you own-- is that it?

00:26:41,715 --> 00:26:43,951
Yeah, but he wouldn't die.

00:26:44,017 --> 00:26:46,186
And I'm glad he did.

00:26:46,253 --> 00:26:48,155
And anyway,
I wasn't the one

00:26:48,221 --> 00:26:49,556
that killed him.

00:26:49,623 --> 00:26:52,793
(whispering):
He just...

00:26:52,859 --> 00:26:54,962
kept coming at me.

00:26:55,028 --> 00:26:57,331
He wouldn't lie down.

00:26:57,397 --> 00:26:59,533
Right.
It was horrible.

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,035
Connor.

00:27:03,403 --> 00:27:05,539
You shot a guy in the neck,
and you don't think

00:27:05,606 --> 00:27:08,208
you killed him?
Uh-huh.

00:27:08,275 --> 00:27:10,544
Well, how do you know
you didn't kill him?

00:27:10,611 --> 00:27:13,247
How do you know he didn't
stagger off somewhere and...

00:27:13,313 --> 00:27:14,448
you know, drop dead

00:27:14,514 --> 00:27:16,850
in the pool?

00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:18,552
I'm liking you
for Happy's murder.

00:27:18,619 --> 00:27:19,886
I'm liking you a lot.

00:27:19,953 --> 00:27:21,288
But I didn't kill him!

00:27:21,355 --> 00:27:23,724
And I'd do it again
if I had a chance!

00:27:26,593 --> 00:27:29,029
(whispering):
I killed him?

00:27:29,096 --> 00:27:30,664
(quietly):
Yeah.

00:27:30,731 --> 00:27:33,267
I killed him?

00:27:34,868 --> 00:27:37,304
I killed him!

00:27:37,371 --> 00:27:38,538
(sobs)

00:27:38,605 --> 00:27:41,074
(phone rings)

00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:43,877
(sobbing quietly)

00:27:43,944 --> 00:27:46,146
Are you gonna get that?

00:27:46,213 --> 00:27:47,514
Yeah.

00:27:49,783 --> 00:27:51,852
Listen, I just got a confession

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,488
from the crossbow guy,
so we're all set.

00:27:54,554 --> 00:27:57,157
Well, then I am sorry
to ruin your day,

00:27:57,224 --> 00:28:00,260
but I certainly appreciate
the company.

00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:03,864
Your guy might be the shooter...

00:28:03,931 --> 00:28:06,667
but he's not the killer.

00:28:06,733 --> 00:28:08,602
(crying)
He-he's not...
What do you mean?

00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:09,770
I mean...

00:28:09,836 --> 00:28:11,104
It's not him.

00:28:11,171 --> 00:28:13,340
(loud sobbing)

00:28:17,998 --> 00:28:19,366
ROBBINS:
<i>Happy was on the verge</i>

00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:20,867
<i>of anaphylactic shock.</i>

00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:22,869
<i>His trachea was</i>
<i>almost completely blocked.</i>

00:28:22,936 --> 00:28:24,671
<i>And then he got shot.</i>

00:28:24,738 --> 00:28:26,974
<i>The arrow reopened his airway,</i>

00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,509
in essence gave him
an emergency tracheotomy.

00:28:29,576 --> 00:28:32,012
So the guy took an arrow
through the throat,

00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:34,815
and it <i>prolonged</i>
his life?
Apparently.

00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:37,484
And what are the odds of it
not hitting a major artery?

00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:39,720
Whatever comes
right before zero.

00:28:39,786 --> 00:28:43,290
So C.O.D. is anaphylactic shock?

00:28:43,357 --> 00:28:44,524
Not entirely.

00:28:44,591 --> 00:28:45,726
The epiglottal tissues

00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:47,594
are only slightly swollen,

00:28:47,661 --> 00:28:49,229
which suggests
the anaphylaxis

00:28:49,296 --> 00:28:51,365
had enough time
to subside.
(clears throat)

00:28:51,431 --> 00:28:53,634
Not now, David.
I'm sorry,

00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,936
but Happy's antigen assay
came back.

00:28:56,003 --> 00:28:58,338
The anaphylaxis was a reaction
to shellfish.

00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:01,642
I didn't find any seafood in
his stomach or small intestine.

00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:03,510
Just six
and a half pounds

00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:05,812
of undigested red meat.

00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:07,914
Well, that explains
the flatulence.

00:29:07,981 --> 00:29:09,616
And nothing else.

00:29:09,683 --> 00:29:11,918
HODGES:
<i>Anything?</i>

00:29:11,985 --> 00:29:14,021
SANDERS:
No shellfish yet,

00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:17,858
but plenty of used condoms,
as well as antifungal powder,

00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:20,360
vaginal lubricant, hair balls,

00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:22,162
toenail clippings,

00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:23,664
hemorrhoid cream

00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,433
and lice-killing shampoo.

00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,502
Somehow, the whole
brothel mystique

00:29:28,568 --> 00:29:30,737
is wearing thin.

00:29:39,913 --> 00:29:42,449
I found a couple
of syringes, too.

00:29:42,516 --> 00:29:44,484
I thought these girls were
supposed to be drug-free.

00:29:44,551 --> 00:29:47,154
Well, maybe there's a legitimate
medical reason for that.

00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,724
Yeah. That's why it was stuffed
inside of a tampon applicator.

00:29:53,026 --> 00:29:54,194
SANDERS:
You know,

00:29:54,261 --> 00:29:56,163
I kind of feel bad
for these girls.

00:29:56,229 --> 00:29:57,898
Don't feel too bad.

00:29:57,965 --> 00:30:00,500
They have health
benefits, good pay.

00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:01,702
Women get
regular checkups.

00:30:01,768 --> 00:30:03,403
The industry is
well-regulated,

00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:07,007
as opposed to picking
a hooker up off the street.

00:30:07,074 --> 00:30:08,475
Does she have a disease?

00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:09,743
Multiple diseases?

00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,645
Is she crazy?
Is she gonna roll you?

00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:14,314
Where do you go?
Do you do it in your car?

00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:15,415
Behind a building?

00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:17,417
Down a dark alley?

00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:20,153
So you drive around,
scared out of your mind.

00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,990
You finally get the nerve up,
pick one you like,

00:30:23,056 --> 00:30:24,391
call her over,

00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:26,526
she gets in-- next
thing you know,

00:30:26,593 --> 00:30:27,995
you're down on the pavement,
cuffed,

00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:29,463
'cause she's an undercover cop,

00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:31,832
but luckily, you're three months
shy of your 18th birthday,

00:30:31,898 --> 00:30:34,167
so when you call your mom
to come get you,

00:30:34,234 --> 00:30:35,902
it doesn't go
on my permanent record.

00:30:37,404 --> 00:30:38,639
Okay.

00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:43,744
(like a carny):
We've got a winnah!

00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:12,639
(beeping)

00:31:29,189 --> 00:31:31,591
GRISSOM:
<i>The prints on the shrimp tails</i>

00:31:31,658 --> 00:31:33,460
<i>all came back</i>
<i>to George Babinkian,</i>

00:31:33,527 --> 00:31:35,128
<i>but whoever</i>
<i>was eating the shrimp</i>

00:31:35,195 --> 00:31:36,997
<i>was wearing lavender lipstick--</i>
<i>so I'm guessing</i>

00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:38,165
<i>it wasn't Binky.</i>

00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:40,801
BRASS:
Well, that's Doris's color.

00:31:40,867 --> 00:31:43,303
Doc was bothered there
was no sign of shellfish

00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:46,073
in Happy's digestive tracts,
so he went back and checked

00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:47,608
the genital area--
there are

00:31:47,674 --> 00:31:49,443
clear indications
that the point of entry

00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:51,912
of the anaphylaxis...
was through

00:31:51,979 --> 00:31:54,114
the urethra.
Oh...

00:31:54,181 --> 00:31:55,349
Yeah.

00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:57,150
You know, when I
talked to the girls,

00:31:57,217 --> 00:31:59,753
they told me that
Doris and Happy had a <i>thang.</i>

00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,789
You add Binky into the mix,
and that is one nasty little

00:32:02,856 --> 00:32:03,991
love triangle.

00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:06,293
So, are we making progress?

00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,595
Well, actually, it's a...
it's a very complicated case.

00:32:08,662 --> 00:32:11,098
We were hoping maybe you'd
help us out a little.

00:32:11,164 --> 00:32:12,766
Well, of course,

00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:14,801
gentlemen, anything.
Well, apparently,

00:32:14,868 --> 00:32:18,071
Happy was in the midst
of a life-threatening
anaphylactic collapse.

00:32:18,138 --> 00:32:19,640
Do you know
what that means?

00:32:21,074 --> 00:32:23,176
Um....
It's a very heavy

00:32:23,243 --> 00:32:24,945
allergy attack...

00:32:25,012 --> 00:32:26,947
to shellfish.

00:32:27,014 --> 00:32:30,784
But the strange thing is,
the allergen, it seems,

00:32:30,851 --> 00:32:32,719
was introduced
into Happy's system

00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:34,688
through oral-genital contact.

00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,059
I have no idea what
you're talking about now.

00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:41,561
(clears throat)

00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:43,463
DINKY:
Now...

00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:46,066
(seething breaths)
Uh... gentlemen,

00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:47,334
she's very hot my wife.

00:32:47,401 --> 00:32:49,903
She was very fond of...

00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,171
of this boxer.

00:32:51,238 --> 00:32:53,340
Apparently.
Will you excuse us?

00:32:53,407 --> 00:32:57,377
I would like to... comfort
and talk to my wife.

00:32:57,444 --> 00:32:58,879
Well, no,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

00:32:58,946 --> 00:33:00,914
No. I think it'll be all right.
Go ahead.

00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:02,716
Thank you, thank you.

00:33:02,783 --> 00:33:03,951
Take your time.

00:33:05,786 --> 00:33:07,454
What was that about?

00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:18,565
These rooms are all wired
for sound.

00:33:18,632 --> 00:33:20,167
We can't use this as evidence.

00:33:20,233 --> 00:33:22,736
They have no expectation
of privacy in those rooms.

00:33:22,803 --> 00:33:23,904
Binky and Doris are

00:33:23,971 --> 00:33:25,772
the ones who wired them,

00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:28,842
and they listen to their
clients all the time.

00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:34,848
DORIS:
That's why you did it.

00:33:34,915 --> 00:33:36,350
That's why you
fed me the shrimp.

00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:37,951
I feed you shrimps
because I love you.

00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:40,120
And you love shrimp, no?
Don't play dumb
with me, George.

00:33:40,187 --> 00:33:42,723
Somehow you figured out
that Happy was allergic.

00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:44,424
Oh, you crazy talk, crazy.

00:33:44,491 --> 00:33:45,859
No, it's all
clear to me now.

00:33:45,926 --> 00:33:47,127
How long have you known?

00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:49,263
Known about what?
About me

00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:51,098
and Happy.

00:33:52,499 --> 00:33:55,902
You were doing boxer?

00:33:55,969 --> 00:33:57,971
DORIS:
Screw you, George.

00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:00,207
You know damn well I was.

00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:02,609
I don't care of you have
your flingy-flingys.

00:34:02,676 --> 00:34:03,810
We're living
in America, no?

00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:05,145
I mean everybody's
entitled

00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:06,780
to pursuit of happy.

00:34:06,847 --> 00:34:09,549
What's done is done, Doris.

00:34:09,616 --> 00:34:10,951
He was turning
into big drag.

00:34:11,018 --> 00:34:12,052
He's dead now.

00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,454
May God take his soul
and rest.

00:34:14,521 --> 00:34:16,323
You're setting me up, George.

00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,791
I...

00:34:20,227 --> 00:34:21,762
Now don't you shush me, George.

00:34:21,828 --> 00:34:23,764
You know what?
You've pulled some really

00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,800
out-to-lunch crap in your life,
George, but this...

00:34:26,867 --> 00:34:28,201
is...

00:34:31,805 --> 00:34:33,240
GEORGE:
What you just said...

00:34:33,307 --> 00:34:34,908
I didn't mean it.

00:34:34,975 --> 00:34:36,310
That was just
crazy talk.

00:34:36,376 --> 00:34:37,344
Yeah.

00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:39,146
I mean, nobody
would ever possibly

00:34:39,212 --> 00:34:40,647
believe, not for a single
solitary moment,

00:34:40,714 --> 00:34:42,482
I mean not for a single
solitary moment,

00:34:42,549 --> 00:34:45,185
that you, that I,
that Happy...

00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:47,220
Oh, come here,
baby, baby, come.

00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:48,522
Oh. I love you.

00:34:49,957 --> 00:34:51,725
I love you.

00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:53,593
I love you.

00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,628
I love you.

00:34:54,695 --> 00:34:56,763
(sobbing):
I love you, too.

00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:59,099
And I love you both.

00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:01,068
Let's go.
You're under arrest.

00:35:01,134 --> 00:35:03,337
GRISSOM:
<i>Binky used Doris</i>

00:35:03,403 --> 00:35:06,406
to induce Happy's allergic
reaction to shrimp

00:35:06,473 --> 00:35:08,308
as a sort of test
her fidelity...

00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:09,576
And Happy ends up dead.

00:35:09,643 --> 00:35:10,644
Not bad.

00:35:10,711 --> 00:35:11,878
Who's Brass going to charge?

00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:14,748
Don't bother.

00:35:14,815 --> 00:35:16,550
You can't charge either one.

00:35:22,626 --> 00:35:24,895
ROBBINS:
<i>On secondary examination</i>
<i>of the body,</i>

00:35:24,961 --> 00:35:28,131
<i>I noticed a patch of necrotic</i>
<i>skin on the right calf.</i>

00:35:28,198 --> 00:35:30,033
<i>Looked like a bite</i>
<i>of some kind.</i>

00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,135
<i>So I sent blood off for</i>
<i>prothrombin</i>

00:35:32,202 --> 00:35:34,104
<i>time and blood venom ratio.</i>

00:35:34,171 --> 00:35:36,506
It came back positive
for snake venom.

00:35:36,573 --> 00:35:38,976
Smashed with a crowbar,

00:35:39,042 --> 00:35:41,211
shot by a crossbow,

00:35:41,278 --> 00:35:44,414
poisoned by shrimp
and now bitten by a snake?

00:35:44,481 --> 00:35:47,351
Sort of-- Happy had Western
Diamondback Rattlesnake

00:35:47,417 --> 00:35:50,253
venom in his system--
the real deal--

00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,322
but it wasn't from a bite.

00:35:52,389 --> 00:35:54,691
<i>I histo-ed the wound and</i>
<i>checked the cross-section.</i>

00:35:54,758 --> 00:35:58,795
<i>Snake bite punctures</i>
<i>are typically curved...</i>

00:35:58,862 --> 00:36:00,163
Yeah, these are straight.

00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,165
And one's deeper
than the other.

00:36:02,232 --> 00:36:05,168
Look like needle marks.

00:36:05,235 --> 00:36:06,903
As you can see, the
tissue around the wound

00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:09,773
was pretty badly
degraded.

00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,508
Greg found this

00:36:11,575 --> 00:36:13,744
in the trash

00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,412
of one of the girls' rooms.

00:36:15,479 --> 00:36:17,447
Which girl?

00:36:17,514 --> 00:36:19,082
BRASS:
So I think you'll be
happy to know

00:36:19,149 --> 00:36:21,351
that your little crowbar stunt
didn't kill Happy.

00:36:21,418 --> 00:36:22,586
Really?

00:36:22,653 --> 00:36:23,920
Really.

00:36:23,987 --> 00:36:25,989
Oh, that's great.

00:36:26,056 --> 00:36:27,290
That's like I told you.

00:36:27,357 --> 00:36:28,592
So can I go now?

00:36:28,659 --> 00:36:30,827
Well, don't you even
want to know how he died?

00:36:34,064 --> 00:36:36,867
Well... yeah, okay.

00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:38,802
You know, it was
the damnedest thing.

00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:41,605
He had snake venom
in his system.

00:36:41,672 --> 00:36:43,106
Huh.

00:36:44,641 --> 00:36:46,076
A snakebite.

00:36:46,143 --> 00:36:48,545
Isn't that a hoot?

00:36:48,612 --> 00:36:50,814
Yeah, that's just
what it is-- a hoot.

00:36:50,881 --> 00:36:54,551
You know, there's a bunch
of those rattlers

00:36:54,618 --> 00:36:55,919
all up over those hills.

00:36:55,986 --> 00:36:57,087
I bet he just...

00:36:57,154 --> 00:36:58,889
Oh, he wasn't bitten.

00:36:58,955 --> 00:37:00,123
No, he was injected.

00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,225
Yeah. Somebody

00:37:02,292 --> 00:37:04,428
took a syringe full
of snake venom

00:37:04,494 --> 00:37:06,063
and injected it in his leg.

00:37:06,129 --> 00:37:09,232
I don't know nothing about that.

00:37:09,299 --> 00:37:10,901
Oh, we found

00:37:10,968 --> 00:37:12,336
the syringe with
the venom in it

00:37:12,402 --> 00:37:14,871
and your DNA on it in the tube
you hid it in.

00:37:14,938 --> 00:37:17,374
I mean, you might

00:37:17,441 --> 00:37:21,945
have walked on the crowbar
thing, but this is premeditated.

00:37:22,012 --> 00:37:24,348
And that can be very,
very bad for you.

00:37:24,414 --> 00:37:27,017
Look, I know that you
and Connor did this together.

00:37:27,084 --> 00:37:30,287
He's already going down
for the crossbow shot.

00:37:30,354 --> 00:37:33,991
That's probably why
he gave you up.

00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:40,964
He-he blamed...
he blamed it on me?

00:37:41,031 --> 00:37:42,966
He said that you cooked up
the whole thing

00:37:43,033 --> 00:37:45,102
from top to bottom.

00:37:52,609 --> 00:37:54,611
Mm...

00:37:54,678 --> 00:37:58,515
Connor would never say that.

00:37:58,582 --> 00:38:01,051
He was in love with me.

00:38:01,118 --> 00:38:04,488
Are you saying that faking
the snakebite was his idea?

00:38:04,554 --> 00:38:05,822
No.

00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:08,558
Connor ain't that smart.

00:38:10,327 --> 00:38:12,562
It was my idea.

00:38:12,629 --> 00:38:14,031
(rattling)

00:38:14,097 --> 00:38:17,501
<i>My daddy was a serpent-handling</i>
<i>preacher.</i>

00:38:17,567 --> 00:38:19,202
<i>My people all had</i>
<i>the holy fire.</i>

00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:21,605
<i>I had it, too,</i>

00:38:21,672 --> 00:38:24,308
<i>but mine came from below.</i>

00:38:28,278 --> 00:38:31,214
I caught and milked
that rattler.

00:38:31,281 --> 00:38:33,083
CONNOR:
<i>Dreama said she did it?</i>

00:38:34,117 --> 00:38:35,819
By herself?

00:38:35,886 --> 00:38:37,954
That's right.

00:38:38,021 --> 00:38:40,357
You're going to walk out
of here a free man.

00:38:40,424 --> 00:38:42,693
And she's going to jail,
and you can visit her

00:38:42,759 --> 00:38:45,495
every third Thursday
until she's a very old lady.

00:38:45,562 --> 00:38:47,631
Is that the way
you want it to be?

00:38:47,698 --> 00:38:48,966
No.

00:38:49,032 --> 00:38:50,701
Well, that's the way
it's going to be.

00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:53,103
Unless you can convince me
she's lying

00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,671
just to save your sorry ass.

00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,177
That ain't the way
it went down.

00:39:01,712 --> 00:39:06,450
Dreama thought it up,
but I'm the one who stuck it in.

00:39:15,392 --> 00:39:16,893
(mouthing)

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,462
HAPPY:
Come on, honey, stop...

00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,563
DREAMA:
That's okay. Shh.

00:39:19,629 --> 00:39:20,764
Go back sleep.
Later, I'll get
you later.

00:39:20,831 --> 00:39:22,466
Okay?
It's okay.

00:39:22,532 --> 00:39:23,834
Two holes.

00:39:24,901 --> 00:39:26,103
Two holes.

00:39:26,169 --> 00:39:29,106
Oh.

00:39:29,172 --> 00:39:32,109
CONNOR:
<i>And then I went</i>
<i>and I dumped his body</i>

00:39:32,175 --> 00:39:33,610
<i>into the culvert.</i>

00:39:33,677 --> 00:39:37,280
<i>Me, by myself.</i>

00:39:37,347 --> 00:39:39,883
Right now the D.A.'s not sure
who he's going to charge.

00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:42,519
What he needs from us
is the most accurate
timeline we can provide.

00:39:42,586 --> 00:39:43,954
Well, according

00:39:44,021 --> 00:39:47,124
to Tox, the hemolytic
component of the venom

00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,358
had time to break down tissue,

00:39:48,425 --> 00:39:50,394
which means that it had to have
been in his system

00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,428
at least a few hours.

00:39:51,495 --> 00:39:53,263
So the fake snakebite
is around 1:00.

00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:57,167
<i>Happy's down... but not out.</i>

00:40:03,073 --> 00:40:05,375
Well, that gets Dreama
and Connor

00:40:05,442 --> 00:40:07,778
for attempted murder
with conspiracy to commit.

00:40:07,844 --> 00:40:10,480
And earlier that night,
Binky fed Doris

00:40:10,547 --> 00:40:13,450
some jumbo tiger shrimp,

00:40:13,517 --> 00:40:14,985
<i>knowing that she'd eventually</i>

00:40:15,052 --> 00:40:17,054
<i>find Happy for round two.</i>

00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,989
Dreama!

00:40:19,056 --> 00:40:22,492
<i>Oye, mamita.</i>

00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:24,461
I don't feel too good.

00:40:24,528 --> 00:40:26,997
Come here, baby.

00:40:27,064 --> 00:40:28,799
I know what you need.

00:40:28,865 --> 00:40:30,701
I'm going to make you

00:40:30,767 --> 00:40:32,636
feel all better.

00:40:32,703 --> 00:40:34,338
Come to Doris, baby.

00:40:34,404 --> 00:40:37,874
Doris administers
some very special first aid...

00:40:37,941 --> 00:40:40,410
and Happy's little soldier
swells to battalion size.

00:40:42,379 --> 00:40:44,314
Babinkian knew about
that shellfish allergy--

00:40:44,381 --> 00:40:46,650
that's intent, right?

00:40:46,717 --> 00:40:49,686
In any event, Binky and Doris
lawyered up.

00:40:49,753 --> 00:40:51,321
They're sticking together.

00:40:51,388 --> 00:40:52,990
How romantic.

00:40:53,056 --> 00:40:56,426
So, now Happy is not so happy,

00:40:56,493 --> 00:40:59,196
because he'd heading into
anaphylactic shock.

00:40:59,262 --> 00:41:02,699
GRISSOM:
<i>According to Narco, Happy had</i>
<i>epinephrine in his trailer,</i>

00:41:02,766 --> 00:41:05,068
<i>which is probably what he was</i>
<i>trying to get to</i>

00:41:05,135 --> 00:41:06,703
<i>in round two.</i>

00:41:12,743 --> 00:41:15,078
STOKES:
<i>That's assault</i>
<i>with a deadly weapon.</i>

00:41:15,145 --> 00:41:17,714
GRISSOM:
<i>But not necessarily murder.</i>

00:41:17,781 --> 00:41:21,318
So the field tracheotomy
buys un-Happy enough time

00:41:21,385 --> 00:41:22,753
to get the epi.

00:41:32,629 --> 00:41:34,464
(gasps)

00:41:37,501 --> 00:41:39,569
At this point, you'd think he
would've just called it a night.

00:41:39,636 --> 00:41:41,471
Watched a little TV,
hit the sack,

00:41:41,538 --> 00:41:43,273
but no.

00:41:43,907 --> 00:41:46,443
Dreama.

00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,612
I'm going to get you,
you little bitch.

00:41:56,486 --> 00:41:58,822
Which brings us to round four.

00:42:01,858 --> 00:42:03,393
(groans)

00:42:38,095 --> 00:42:40,330
The T.K.O.

00:42:40,397 --> 00:42:41,898
You do know what a good
defense attorney

00:42:41,965 --> 00:42:43,700
is going to say to all this,
don't you?

00:42:43,767 --> 00:42:44,835
What?

00:42:44,901 --> 00:42:46,570
The lawn chair did it.
