This is a large section
of her living room carpet--

00:06:27,448 --> 00:06:30,752
wet to the touch,
pheno confirmed a blood pool.

00:06:30,818 --> 00:06:33,187
Well, it's certainly enough
blood to suggest foul play.

00:06:33,254 --> 00:06:34,889
There were
also traces of

00:06:34,956 --> 00:06:37,325

I think their UFO club is based
on the teachings of this guy.

00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,914
...and the natural form of these
invaders is not human.

00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,982
They are described
in ancient accounts

00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:10,818
as serpents and dragons.

00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:14,622
And man's weapon against them
is the sword.

00:13:14,689 --> 00:13:18,159
Cut off the tail,
the serpent lives.

00:13:18,226 --> 00:13:21,863
Cut off its head, and it dies.

00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,500
So Connors cut off her head

00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:28,336
because he thought she was
a serpent from outer space?

00:13:33,675 --> 00:13:35,677
BRASS:
Catherine...

00:13:35,743 --> 00:13:37,745
check this out.

00:13:40,715 --> 00:13:43,618
Chyna De Vere's
husband Preston.

00:13:43,685 --> 00:13:46,154
What's Shannon
doing with him?

00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,989
"Chillin' in Cabo."

00:13:57,131 --> 00:13:58,499
(cat meowing)

00:13:58,566 --> 00:14:00,168
BRASS:
Aww.

00:14:02,704 --> 00:14:04,639
Well, while Mommy's
in custody,

00:14:04,706 --> 00:14:06,874
I guess the kitty's hungry;
I'll call Animal Control.

00:14:08,409 --> 00:14:10,078
Oh, Jim...

00:14:14,315 --> 00:14:17,518
Well, hello, Xena.

00:14:25,593 --> 00:14:27,629
(splashing, squishing)

00:14:52,973 --> 00:14:54,975
(drill whirring)

00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:18,397
Oh, boy.

00:15:18,463 --> 00:15:20,732
Look what he used
on the incision.

00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,701
Duct tape?

00:15:22,768 --> 00:15:24,236
Yeah, he used it
to close up

00:15:24,302 --> 00:15:27,239
the laceration from
a sharp force perimortem wound.

00:15:27,305 --> 00:15:31,309
Corresponds to the indentation
in the skull.

00:15:31,376 --> 00:15:33,145
Could that be the fatal wound?

00:15:33,211 --> 00:15:35,080
Give me the rest of the body
and I can tell you.

00:15:35,147 --> 00:15:37,249
Nick's working on it.

00:15:37,315 --> 00:15:39,985
Almost three inches,

00:15:40,052 --> 00:15:42,421
smooth-edge blade;
you know, Catherine found--
Yeah, I heard.

00:15:42,487 --> 00:15:45,991
A sword-- everyone's talking
about this one.

00:15:46,058 --> 00:15:48,293
Why would anybody want

00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,128
to taxidermy a human head?

00:15:50,195 --> 00:15:51,763
I'm still working on the "how."

00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,565
That, I can tell you.

00:15:53,632 --> 00:15:55,467
Mounted one myself.

00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:57,736
A deer-- Dad was a hunter.

00:15:57,803 --> 00:15:59,738
First, our guy
had to separate

00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:01,473
the head from the body.

00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,311
For that, he used
a serrated-edge knife.

00:16:06,378 --> 00:16:09,014
Dad used a carving knife, same
one we used at Thanksgiving.

00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:10,348
When mom found out,

00:16:10,415 --> 00:16:11,950
she almost killed
him with it.

00:16:12,017 --> 00:16:13,085
Heartwarming.

00:16:13,151 --> 00:16:15,687
Yeah, so then...

00:16:15,754 --> 00:16:17,823
he had to flesh the skin away

00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:19,791
from the underlying muscle.

00:16:23,662 --> 00:16:26,298
Next, he would've stretched
the skin out on a board,

00:16:26,364 --> 00:16:28,166
<i>rubbed it with rock salt...</i>

00:16:30,535 --> 00:16:32,871
...then waited two days.

00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:35,707
Then he tanned the skin
to preserve it,

00:16:35,774 --> 00:16:37,843
<i>hydrated it with a borax</i>
<i>and water solution</i>

00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:39,811
<i>to keep the bugs off.</i>

00:16:39,878 --> 00:16:41,480
Next, he cleaned the skull,

00:16:41,546 --> 00:16:44,483
filled the imperfections
with clay, sawdust,

00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:45,650
anything at hand.

00:16:45,717 --> 00:16:47,686
Popped in two glass eyes,

00:16:47,753 --> 00:16:50,222
and then...

00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,994
And he's got the best-looking
wall mount the neighborhood.

00:16:56,061 --> 00:16:58,130
We're going to need to
process that toolmark.

00:16:58,196 --> 00:17:00,265
Yeah, I'll get it
over to CSI.

00:17:19,751 --> 00:17:21,620
(playful shuddering):
Oh... nice sword.

00:17:21,686 --> 00:17:23,021
Mm-hmm!

00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:24,689
I dated a guy on
the fencing team.

00:17:24,756 --> 00:17:26,691
His thighs
were incredible.

00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:28,226
Did you want to
show me something?

00:17:28,293 --> 00:17:31,530
Yes, the, uh, tip
has been wiped clean.

00:17:31,596 --> 00:17:32,964
Negative for blood.

00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:35,834
But I did find
a couple of partials

00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:38,136
on the blade
just above the hilt.

00:17:38,203 --> 00:17:42,074
Okay.
And a couple of full prints

00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,408
on the handle.

00:17:43,475 --> 00:17:48,213
STOKES:
The femur measures
461 millimeters.

00:17:50,248 --> 00:17:54,186
Gives us a height
for a white female of 5'6".

00:17:54,252 --> 00:17:56,188
Exactly Chyna's height.

00:17:56,254 --> 00:17:57,923
How about for a male?

00:17:57,989 --> 00:17:59,524
5'7".
Preston De Vere
is too tall.

00:17:59,591 --> 00:18:01,526
Did you measure
the head of the femur?

00:18:01,593 --> 00:18:03,995
No, sir, I was
just about to.

00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,769
41 point s...
point five millimeters.

00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:12,771
It's a female.

00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:14,239
You want my theory?

00:18:15,807 --> 00:18:17,109
This little piggy
went to market.

00:18:17,175 --> 00:18:19,177
This little piggy
stayed home.

00:18:19,244 --> 00:18:21,680
This little piggy had Chyna.

00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:24,049
Yeah.

00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:27,119
Human teeth aren't strong enough
to leave these marks.

00:18:27,185 --> 00:18:29,020
And it is consistent
with Connors

00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:31,590
chopping off her head
and tossing his "girls" a bone.

00:18:31,656 --> 00:18:34,393
Okay... go back to the ranch.

00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:36,328
See if you can find
the rest of her.

00:18:38,296 --> 00:18:39,331
WILLOWS:
Hey, Greg.

00:18:39,398 --> 00:18:41,733
You up for a bite?

00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,436
(forced laughter)

00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:45,604
(pounds counter)

00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,807
(continues laughing)

00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:53,078
No.

00:18:53,145 --> 00:18:55,080
I am on antibiotics,

00:18:55,147 --> 00:18:57,082
I had a tetanus shot--

00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:59,184
I'm having a pretty bad year.

00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:02,587
Oh, it's only a bad year
if you do a bad job, Greg.

00:19:02,654 --> 00:19:04,389
You're having a great year.

00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:08,460
I got that gel ready for you.

00:19:11,596 --> 00:19:13,198
♪ ♪

00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:45,397
♪ ♪

00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:04,583
Voilà!

00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:05,684
We have our weapon?

00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:07,753
Yeah, and a mounted human head,

00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:11,323
a suicidal pig farmer,
a missing husband,

00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,658
and a bunch of UFO believers.

00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:15,293
What could be next?

00:20:29,174 --> 00:20:31,109
Wendy got results
back on the blood

00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:33,845
from Connors' workbench
in the pickup truck.

00:20:33,912 --> 00:20:35,714
It's Chyna De Vere.

00:20:35,781 --> 00:20:38,417
Good. Come here,
take a look at this.

00:20:43,588 --> 00:20:46,024
Hey, isn't that, uh...?
Yeah.

00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:48,093
You can see
Dick Cheney, Al Gore,

00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,394
all nine
Supreme Court Justices

00:20:49,461 --> 00:20:52,864
shape-shift into Reptilians.

00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:54,633
Did you know that,
for thousands of years,

00:20:54,699 --> 00:20:57,502
creatures from the constellation
Draco have been mating

00:20:57,569 --> 00:20:59,504
with humans to form
a super-race that includes

00:20:59,571 --> 00:21:02,307
43 U.S. presidents,
most members of Congress,

00:21:02,374 --> 00:21:04,376
and the entire
British royal family?

00:21:04,443 --> 00:21:07,813
Hey, did Shannon Turner
have a cat?
Yeah.

00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:09,314
So did Hank Connors.

00:21:09,381 --> 00:21:10,649
See, it figures.

00:21:10,716 --> 00:21:12,751
Cats are a natural enemy
of reptiles.

00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:15,220
I'll keep that in mind.

00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:17,489
The sword I found
at Shannon Turner's

00:21:17,556 --> 00:21:18,990
made the tool marks
on the skull.

00:21:19,057 --> 00:21:22,060
Shannon's prints were
all over the handle.

00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:24,062
And the partials on the blade,
above the hilt--

00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:25,330
Chyna De Vere's.

00:21:26,732 --> 00:21:28,633
She tried to defend herself.

00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:36,942
Did Wendy find anything on that
drop of blood on the carpet?

00:21:37,008 --> 00:21:38,744
Came back to Shannon.

00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,279
Yeah, but Brass
interviewed her last week.

00:21:41,346 --> 00:21:42,614
She didn't have
any visible cuts.

00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:43,815
Warrick?

00:21:44,983 --> 00:21:46,718
Come at me with a sword.

00:21:48,754 --> 00:21:51,490
All right, so I push
back hard enough...

00:21:51,556 --> 00:21:53,792
<i>bang you on the nose.</i>

00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:55,293
<i>Brass wouldn't have seen that.</i>

00:21:57,028 --> 00:21:58,864
But what I don't understand is

00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:02,434
if Shannon Turner
and Hank Connors
really believed

00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:04,669
in a Reptilian conspiracy

00:22:04,736 --> 00:22:07,806
and they felt threatened
by the political establishment,

00:22:07,873 --> 00:22:10,509
why kill a blackjack dealer?

00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,488
BROWN:
Hey, Nick!

00:22:23,555 --> 00:22:24,956
Yeah?

00:22:25,023 --> 00:22:26,558
I got something
over here.

00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:42,607
Man, that looks human.

00:22:49,715 --> 00:22:52,017
(shutter clicks)

00:23:09,267 --> 00:23:10,802
(blows)

00:23:12,537 --> 00:23:14,106
(blows)

00:23:14,172 --> 00:23:16,108
"To Chyna,

00:23:16,174 --> 00:23:19,211
Love, Preston."

00:23:19,277 --> 00:23:22,748
"To Preston, Love, Chyna."

00:23:22,814 --> 00:23:25,884
Till death do us part.

00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,826
JOHNSON:
<i>According to the Palermo,</i>

00:23:34,893 --> 00:23:37,662
<i>Shannon Turner joined</i>
<i>the Player's Club last month.</i>

00:23:37,729 --> 00:23:40,498
Whenever a player uses a
club card at a table game,

00:23:40,565 --> 00:23:42,800
the floor man writes down
what game you played,

00:23:42,867 --> 00:23:46,004
where you sat,
what time you started,

00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,305
time you quit.

00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:49,741
Then they estimate your average
bet, win-loss ratios...

00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:52,076
No wonder she believed
in conspiracies.

00:23:52,143 --> 00:23:55,079
Well, this is the first time
Shannon used her card.

00:23:55,146 --> 00:23:58,550
SIDLE:
And the dealer
is Chyna.

00:23:58,616 --> 00:24:00,318
(computer beeps)

00:24:00,385 --> 00:24:01,820
JOHNSON:
A week later.

00:24:01,886 --> 00:24:03,254
By now, she's a regular.

00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:05,990
SIDLE:
Looks like they're
best friends.

00:24:06,057 --> 00:24:08,827
(taps key, computer whirs)
Two weeks ago.

00:24:08,893 --> 00:24:10,061
SIDLE:
Table's full.

00:24:10,128 --> 00:24:12,030
She's waiting
for a seat.

00:24:12,096 --> 00:24:14,232
Shannon only gambled
at Chyna's table.

00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:17,168
Maybe Chyna was her lucky charm.

00:24:17,235 --> 00:24:20,572
That depends
on how you define luck.

00:24:22,574 --> 00:24:25,543
SIDLE:
She never walked
away a winner.

00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,513
Maybe she blamed Chyna
for her losses.

00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,182
She's too friendly.

00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:33,885
I think
she was gaining her trust.

00:24:33,952 --> 00:24:35,920
Stalking her.

00:24:35,987 --> 00:24:38,223
Well, it's Las Vegas.

00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:40,158
It's not a crime
to play blackjack.

00:24:40,225 --> 00:24:41,559
You're right,
it's Las Vegas.

00:24:41,626 --> 00:24:44,229
But it is a crime to
lie to the police.

00:24:45,864 --> 00:24:47,832
We found your blood
in Chyna's apartment.

00:24:47,899 --> 00:24:50,040
Then it was planted.

00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,308
By whom?

00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:53,076
How should I know?

00:24:53,143 --> 00:24:54,478
Maybe you planted it.

00:24:54,545 --> 00:24:55,846
Look...

00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,216
...you killed Chyna,

00:24:59,283 --> 00:25:01,952
and you got Connors
to help you move the body.

00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:05,189
And Connors killed Preston,
because he was obsessed with you

00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:06,857
and wanted
to eliminate the competition.

00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:09,259
You lied about knowing Chyna,
you going to lie

00:25:09,326 --> 00:25:11,261
about this, too?

00:25:11,328 --> 00:25:14,097
Preston can't be killed.

00:25:14,164 --> 00:25:15,465
His cells don't die.

00:25:15,532 --> 00:25:17,868
He's over 4,000 years old.

00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:19,069
Oh, 4,000.

00:25:19,136 --> 00:25:21,071
The new 50.

00:25:22,673 --> 00:25:25,209
You just don't know the truth
when you hear it.

00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:28,645
Preston is a great man.

00:25:28,712 --> 00:25:30,714
He has the wisdom of the ages.

00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:34,284
Beyond your capacity
to understand.

00:25:34,351 --> 00:25:36,220
Ms. Turner...

00:25:37,921 --> 00:25:40,490
...was Chyna a Reptilian?

00:25:46,697 --> 00:25:48,699
Who is this?

00:25:51,702 --> 00:25:54,571
The Reptilian Athena.

00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:57,241
Is that Chyna De Vere?

00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:01,645
(papers rustling)

00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:07,684
Tell me about this one.

00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,956
That's the Protector of Mankind.

00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:16,059
Is that you?

00:26:17,895 --> 00:26:20,130
(slurping)

00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:25,135
Hmm?

00:26:27,437 --> 00:26:30,908
Did you slay
the Reptilian Athena?

00:26:30,974 --> 00:26:33,243
I did what I had to do.

00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:37,447
I have to kill you.

00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:38,515
What?!

00:26:38,582 --> 00:26:39,850
(blade rings)

00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:42,920
(grunting)

00:26:42,986 --> 00:26:45,789
It's not like
there's nothing at stake here.

00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:48,859
Just the survival
of the human race.

00:26:48,926 --> 00:26:51,028
Yeah, I'm just
a phone booth away

00:26:51,094 --> 00:26:54,431
from changing into my tights
and saving the world.

00:26:54,498 --> 00:26:56,500
(computer beeps)

00:27:01,338 --> 00:27:03,740
Hey, Warrick,
I got something.

00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:06,143
I was scanning
the casino footage

00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,711
from the day
Chyna disappeared.

00:27:07,778 --> 00:27:10,647
And she had a visitor.

00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:12,282
Her husband.

00:27:12,349 --> 00:27:14,785
She doesn't look so happy
to see him.

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,388
Well, we don't need words
to get that.

00:27:18,455 --> 00:27:19,923
JOHNSON:
"Give me your ring.

00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,859
"I really, really
hate you.

00:27:21,925 --> 00:27:23,193
Our marriage
is over."

00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,628
BROWN:
Well, that means

00:27:24,695 --> 00:27:27,831
she was killed before she had
a chance to change her clothes.

00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:30,133
That would explain why
we found both rings

00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,401
in the ashes.

00:27:31,468 --> 00:27:34,004
But it doesn't explain
what happened to him.

00:27:56,326 --> 00:27:57,327
(camera clicking)

00:28:04,868 --> 00:28:06,870
(camera clicking)

00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:14,111
I found it embedded in this.

00:28:14,177 --> 00:28:15,812
T-9 vertebra.

00:28:15,879 --> 00:28:17,714
But that means
the bullet had to pass

00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:19,149
through at least
one vital organ.

00:28:19,216 --> 00:28:21,752
Yeah, heart, lung,
and then the dome of the liver.

00:28:21,818 --> 00:28:23,020
That's your C.O.D.

00:28:23,086 --> 00:28:25,322
And you're sure
these are Chyna De Vere's bones.

00:28:25,389 --> 00:28:26,657
Yeah, pelvis is female.

00:28:26,723 --> 00:28:28,125
No duplicate bones.

00:28:28,192 --> 00:28:29,493
The femur's the same length

00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,595
as the one
the pigs were chomping on.

00:28:31,662 --> 00:28:33,030
It's her.

00:28:33,096 --> 00:28:36,567
Okay. Well, we'll run this
against Connors' guns.

00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:40,571
(people screaming)

00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:42,839
(roaring)

00:28:42,906 --> 00:28:45,142
(crowd screaming)

00:28:45,209 --> 00:28:47,344
(monster roaring)

00:28:50,113 --> 00:28:52,482
I always feel sorry
for the monster.

00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:54,051
Then you better turn it off

00:28:54,117 --> 00:28:57,054
before they use
the Oxygen Destroyer on him.

00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,156
(monster roaring)

00:29:00,557 --> 00:29:02,693
Hey, Bruno,
come on!

00:29:05,095 --> 00:29:07,197
(monster roaring on TV)

00:29:33,657 --> 00:29:36,293
GRISSOM:
<i>I don't know why</i>
<i>I find it so difficult</i>

00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,364
<i>to express my feelings to you.</i>

00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,432
<i>Even though we're far apart,</i>

00:29:42,499 --> 00:29:46,036
<i>I can see you as vividly</i>
<i>as if you were here with me.</i>

00:29:46,103 --> 00:29:48,238
<i>I said I'll miss you,</i>

00:29:48,305 --> 00:29:50,974
<i>and I do.</i>

00:30:00,184 --> 00:30:02,286
GRISSOM:
<i>As Shakespeare more ably wrote</i>

00:30:02,352 --> 00:30:04,955
<i>my sentiment in Sonnet 47,</i>

00:30:05,022 --> 00:30:10,294
<i>"Thyself away art present</i>

00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,798
<i>"For thou not farther</i>

00:30:14,865 --> 00:30:17,601
<i>"and I am still with them,</i>

00:30:17,668 --> 00:30:20,137
<i>"and they with thee.</i>

00:30:20,204 --> 00:30:22,873
<i>"Or, if they sleep,</i>

00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,109
<i>"thy picture in my sight</i>

00:30:32,816 --> 00:30:34,751
BROWN:
<i>Fire in the hole!</i>

00:30:34,818 --> 00:30:36,353
(gunshot)

00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,489
You're supposed
to let me get these things on.

00:30:39,556 --> 00:30:41,959
Hey, you were
supposed to be ready.

00:30:43,393 --> 00:30:44,595
I don't know, man.

00:30:44,661 --> 00:30:46,230
Maybe it would have
worked out

00:30:46,296 --> 00:30:48,365
if Tina was someone
who did what we did.

00:30:51,335 --> 00:30:54,304
At least
she'd understand the hours.

00:30:54,371 --> 00:30:55,472
Oh, I don't know.

00:30:55,539 --> 00:30:57,341
I don't think
it's a good idea

00:30:57,407 --> 00:30:58,909
to date somebody
you work with.

00:30:58,976 --> 00:31:00,544
You never really
get away from

00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:03,714
work or them the way
you need to, you know?

00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,716
You mean, like me
and you, baby?

00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:08,318
Yeah, exactly, honey.

00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:14,892
Mm-hmm.

00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,727
Yeah, it looks like

00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:21,298
the bullet that killed her came
from Connors' Walther PPK.

00:31:21,365 --> 00:31:23,066
(crying)

00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:24,268
(gunshot)

00:31:37,714 --> 00:31:39,650
Captain Brass?

00:31:39,716 --> 00:31:41,285
Jim.

00:31:41,351 --> 00:31:42,553
Joe Vasquez.

00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:44,054
How you doing, Joe?

00:31:44,121 --> 00:31:46,190
I got a call from
a passing motorist.

00:31:46,256 --> 00:31:48,158
Naked guy running
around in the desert.

00:31:48,225 --> 00:31:50,594
That may not be so
strange where you work,

00:31:50,661 --> 00:31:52,629
but out here, it
gets our attention.

00:31:52,696 --> 00:31:54,932
I recognized him
from the news.

00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:56,934
Thanks a lot, Joe.

00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:03,273
Preston De Vere?

00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,510
Very glad to be back home.

00:32:06,577 --> 00:32:09,046
What are you doing
out here, Preston?

00:32:09,112 --> 00:32:12,316
I was a captive,
held against my will.

00:32:14,117 --> 00:32:17,387
From what the Sheriff tells me,
I've been gone over a week.

00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:20,791
Feels like just seconds.

00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:23,193
Can you describe these people
to me?

00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:27,865
Well, yes,
but you won't believe me.

00:32:27,931 --> 00:32:29,733
Try me.

00:32:32,836 --> 00:32:34,805
They were very tall...

00:32:34,872 --> 00:32:37,641
with Reptilian features;

00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:40,811
large, almond-shaped, red eyes.

00:32:43,616 --> 00:32:46,619
Hey, what's happening,
Lizard King?

00:32:46,685 --> 00:32:48,587
I appreciate your skepticism.

00:32:48,654 --> 00:32:50,656
I anticipated it.

00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:55,828
Insight begins
with asking the right questions.

00:32:55,895 --> 00:32:57,696
Okay, then,

00:32:57,763 --> 00:33:00,733
when exactly were you abducted?

00:33:05,037 --> 00:33:06,972
Nine days ago.

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,242
Oh, so you were abducted
before your wife was missing.

00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:11,844
What do you mean Chyna
is missing?

00:33:11,911 --> 00:33:12,845
What happened to her?

00:33:12,912 --> 00:33:14,914
What are you trying to tell me?

00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,682
You don't know
your wife is dead?

00:33:16,749 --> 00:33:18,951
That was callous of you.

00:33:19,018 --> 00:33:21,353
Unnecessarily cruel.

00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,622
I had no idea.

00:33:24,623 --> 00:33:27,693
(sobbing)

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,528
That sweet girl...

00:33:29,595 --> 00:33:31,630
Stop the crocodile tears.

00:33:31,697 --> 00:33:32,765
Come on.

00:33:32,832 --> 00:33:33,766
Preston.

00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:35,101
If she was so sweet,

00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:38,904
what were you doing chillin'
in Cabo with Shannon Turner?

00:33:38,971 --> 00:33:41,040
Are you suggesting
that was romantic?

00:33:41,107 --> 00:33:42,908
Well, you got your pictures
on the coffee mug.

00:33:42,975 --> 00:33:44,844
That's romantic to me.

00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,278
You better come up
with an alibi--

00:33:46,345 --> 00:33:48,447
on planet Earth--
of where you were

00:33:48,514 --> 00:33:50,116
the night your wife was killed.

00:33:52,151 --> 00:33:54,920
That's easy.

00:33:59,258 --> 00:34:03,796
There's a woman, and it is
romantic, very romantic.

00:34:05,431 --> 00:34:08,134
I was with her
when they took me.

00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,469
Her name is Clarissa Niles.

00:34:11,504 --> 00:34:13,405
MAN:
<i>We are victims...</i>

00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,776
...and no one is listening
to us.

00:34:16,842 --> 00:34:17,777
We're powerless

00:34:17,843 --> 00:34:20,079
against what's going on.

00:34:20,146 --> 00:34:21,714
We're not crazy.

00:34:21,781 --> 00:34:25,818
If you look at who has had
contact, we're airline pilots,

00:34:25,885 --> 00:34:28,354
professionals,
teachers, scientists.

00:34:28,421 --> 00:34:32,792
I don't know how to get
the truth out, but we have to.

00:34:34,794 --> 00:34:38,597
Has anyone talked to Shannon
in the last couple of days?

00:34:42,034 --> 00:34:44,103
They've got her.

00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:47,473
It's like we're witnessing
some form of mass hallucination.

00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,141
You know,
they think

00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:52,178
the cops are part of this
Reptilian conspiracy as well.

00:34:52,244 --> 00:34:54,013
That's why Shannon
attacked Greg.

00:35:01,654 --> 00:35:04,657
And why Hank Connors
shot himself.

00:35:16,402 --> 00:35:17,870
Sorry to interrupt.

00:35:17,937 --> 00:35:19,405
Don't make eye
contact with them.

00:35:20,773 --> 00:35:23,409
Please, we
come in peace.

00:35:25,911 --> 00:35:28,347
Which one of you is
Clarissa Niles?

00:35:28,414 --> 00:35:31,083
(whispering):
Don't.

00:35:32,118 --> 00:35:33,719
It's all right.

00:35:33,786 --> 00:35:35,287
I'm not afraid.

00:35:35,354 --> 00:35:38,624
SANDERS:
<i>Got a warrant to tow in</i>
<i>Clarissa Niles' car.</i>

00:35:38,691 --> 00:35:41,660
Blue fluorescence is one of
the properties of scheelite.

00:35:41,727 --> 00:35:44,663
Which was found in the soil
at Hank Connors' ranch.

00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:47,199
And Preston beamed down
in the same area.

00:35:47,266 --> 00:35:49,668
Have you looked inside yet?

00:35:49,735 --> 00:35:51,737
I was just about to.

00:35:54,473 --> 00:35:57,076
Preston was found naked, right?

00:35:57,143 --> 00:36:00,179
Yeah, it's a recurrent theme
in tales of alien abduction.

00:36:00,246 --> 00:36:02,882
I practically grew up
on <i>The X-Files.</i>

00:36:02,948 --> 00:36:05,117
Preston's wallet.

00:36:06,152 --> 00:36:08,087
Somehow I doubt

00:36:08,154 --> 00:36:10,222
aliens would have folded his
clothes when they abducted him.

00:36:12,057 --> 00:36:14,160
So Clarissa drove him
out there

00:36:14,226 --> 00:36:16,362
and he left his stuff
in her car.

00:36:18,097 --> 00:36:20,399
That's not all he left.

00:36:20,466 --> 00:36:21,400
(chuckles)

00:36:21,467 --> 00:36:22,768
Steam cleaner.

00:36:22,835 --> 00:36:25,337
Just what every
estranged husband needs

00:36:25,404 --> 00:36:27,840
to clean up
his dead wife's blood.

00:36:27,907 --> 00:36:30,609
This case just came down
to Earth.

00:36:30,676 --> 00:36:35,247
Yes, Preston was at my home
in Summerlin.

00:36:35,314 --> 00:36:39,752
We were asleep and suddenly
the room turned very cold.

00:36:39,819 --> 00:36:41,020
Freezing.

00:36:41,087 --> 00:36:45,291
I woke up and looked over
and Preston was gone.

00:36:45,357 --> 00:36:49,728
I... I searched
the house, outside...

00:36:49,795 --> 00:36:52,298
It was as if he evaporated.

00:36:52,364 --> 00:36:53,766
(weary sigh)

00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:55,668
Come on, Clarissa, you're
a smart woman, I mean, really.

00:36:55,734 --> 00:36:57,069
I mean,
you have a beautiful home,

00:36:57,136 --> 00:36:59,305
you're a good citizen, you
pay your taxes, you vote,

00:36:59,371 --> 00:37:00,906
you even play a little golf.

00:37:00,973 --> 00:37:03,809
You got way too much on the ball
to fall for this con man.

00:37:03,876 --> 00:37:05,044
Con man?

00:37:05,111 --> 00:37:06,545
(laughing)

00:37:06,612 --> 00:37:08,247
You think I'm gullible?

00:37:09,281 --> 00:37:11,617
He's a brilliant man.

00:37:11,684 --> 00:37:14,186
He saved my life.

00:37:14,253 --> 00:37:16,455
When we first met,
I was very ill.

00:37:16,522 --> 00:37:19,291
It was cancer
and he cured it.

00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:21,260
Really?

00:37:21,327 --> 00:37:22,461
How'd he do that?

00:37:22,528 --> 00:37:27,366
He knows how to prevent
human cells from dying.

00:37:27,433 --> 00:37:32,071
He has injections;
they're, they're radioactive.

00:37:32,138 --> 00:37:35,307
Hospitals won't do it because
it would make everyone well.

00:37:35,374 --> 00:37:36,942
It would put them
out of business.

00:37:38,177 --> 00:37:41,647
Do you really think
he's 4,000 years old?

00:37:41,714 --> 00:37:44,183
Here.

00:37:45,217 --> 00:37:47,453
Let me show you
something.

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,389
Look at this.

00:37:50,456 --> 00:37:53,526
He's 42.

00:37:53,592 --> 00:37:55,294
He claims he's
a nutritionist.

00:37:55,361 --> 00:37:56,429
He's not.

00:37:56,495 --> 00:37:57,430
And look.

00:37:57,496 --> 00:37:58,864
Look at all these
schools and labs

00:37:58,931 --> 00:38:00,800
he said he went to.

00:38:00,866 --> 00:38:02,001
They never heard of him.

00:38:03,068 --> 00:38:05,671
He has no place of
business, no job.

00:38:05,738 --> 00:38:08,240
He just preys on
vulnerable women.

00:38:08,307 --> 00:38:11,477
He got Shannon Turner to
kill his wife for him.

00:38:11,544 --> 00:38:14,313
Got you to
give him money.

00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,581
He never asked for it.

00:38:15,648 --> 00:38:17,283
I wanted to give it to him.

00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:18,717
You would have done anything
for him,

00:38:18,784 --> 00:38:20,386
whether he asked for it or not.

00:38:20,453 --> 00:38:23,956
Do you have any idea
how beautiful you are?

00:38:24,023 --> 00:38:27,093
I mean really, really,
really beautiful.

00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:28,994
More so every day.

00:38:29,061 --> 00:38:30,696
That's because you cured me.

00:38:30,763 --> 00:38:34,333
I-I-I've never felt better
or happier.

00:38:35,367 --> 00:38:38,270
You know, I didn't want
to alarm you,

00:38:38,337 --> 00:38:39,972
but they put
an implant in you.

00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:41,207
They do it
while you're sleeping

00:38:41,273 --> 00:38:43,642
so they can manipulate
your thoughts.

00:38:43,709 --> 00:38:45,978
My injections disabled it.

00:38:46,045 --> 00:38:49,081
You're not only cancer-free,
you're free of their control.

00:38:49,148 --> 00:38:50,416
Oh, my God.

00:38:50,483 --> 00:38:53,552
How am I ever going
to be able to thank you?

00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:56,856
You drove him
out to McCade,

00:38:56,922 --> 00:39:00,359
you dropped him off, you
brought back his clothes.

00:39:00,426 --> 00:39:02,728
The evidence is
all over your car.

00:39:06,432 --> 00:39:08,367
He loved me.

00:39:08,434 --> 00:39:10,503
He used you

00:39:10,569 --> 00:39:12,905
just like he used everybody.

00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,104
♪ ♪

00:40:08,661 --> 00:40:10,663
If they were trying
to clean up all the blood,

00:40:10,729 --> 00:40:12,031
they did a good job.

00:40:12,098 --> 00:40:13,566
Steam cleaner tested
positive for blood,

00:40:13,632 --> 00:40:14,934
but there wasn't
enough for DNA.

00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,168
Did you find anything?

00:40:16,235 --> 00:40:17,436
Funny you should ask.

00:40:17,503 --> 00:40:18,904
Found a hair
in the brushes.
Oh.

00:40:18,971 --> 00:40:21,474
It's on the left.

00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,743
The one on the right is
Chyna De Vere's.

00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:26,345
They're both Chyna's.

00:40:26,412 --> 00:40:28,013
Hey.

00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,049
That steam cleaner was
completely wiped down,

00:40:30,116 --> 00:40:31,350
couldn't find
any prints.

00:40:31,417 --> 00:40:35,121
But then I remembered this story
about a CSI down in L.A.

00:40:35,187 --> 00:40:37,957
Nobody could find any prints
on a gas can from an arson,

00:40:38,023 --> 00:40:40,025
but he realized that you got
to grip it underneath

00:40:40,092 --> 00:40:41,460
in order to pour out the gas.

00:40:41,527 --> 00:40:43,162
And you know what?

00:40:43,229 --> 00:40:45,598
He broke the case.

00:40:45,664 --> 00:40:48,000
So whose prints are
on the steam cleaner?

00:40:48,067 --> 00:40:49,702
I just got an AFIS hit:

00:40:49,769 --> 00:40:51,670
Preston De Vere.

00:40:53,706 --> 00:40:56,108
You have a destiny.

00:40:56,175 --> 00:40:58,077
You were chosen.

00:40:58,144 --> 00:41:00,446
You are a Protector
of Mankind.

00:41:00,513 --> 00:41:02,248
Have no fear.

00:41:03,282 --> 00:41:05,885
Cut off her tail,
she lives.

00:41:05,951 --> 00:41:07,386
Cut off her head,
she dies.

00:41:07,453 --> 00:41:10,089
No problem.

00:41:18,597 --> 00:41:20,366
It wasn't
a Reptilian conspiracy,

00:41:20,433 --> 00:41:22,668
but it was a conspiracy.

00:41:22,735 --> 00:41:26,372
Men are snakes.

00:41:26,439 --> 00:41:29,108
BRASS:
So we checked Chyna's
bank account.

00:41:29,175 --> 00:41:32,344
She had a tidy little
inheritance until she met you.

00:41:32,411 --> 00:41:35,081
Chyna was sucking
the life out of me.

00:41:35,147 --> 00:41:36,816
She deserved none
of what she wanted

00:41:36,882 --> 00:41:39,251
and all of what she got
in the end.

00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:42,555
I'm glad it took a long time
for her to die.

00:41:42,621 --> 00:41:45,057
I can only imagine the pain.

00:41:45,124 --> 00:41:48,694
You know, every time I think
about leaving this job,

00:41:48,761 --> 00:41:52,298
a guy like you comes along
and reminds me why I can't.

00:42:01,006 --> 00:42:02,041
(spits)

00:42:05,978 --> 00:42:08,080
MAN (on film):
<i>History is replete with stories</i>

00:42:08,147 --> 00:42:10,616
<i>of the heroic destruction</i>

00:42:10,683 --> 00:42:15,287
<i>Perseus and Medusa,</i>
<i>St. George and the Dragon, </i>

<i>St. Patrick</i>
<i>and the Snakes of Ireland.</i>

00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:21,694
<i>These are not merely legends.</i>

00:42:21,761 --> 00:42:24,230
<i>These are accounts of battles</i>

00:42:24,296 --> 00:42:28,467
<i>for the survival</i>
<i>of the human race--</i>

00:42:28,534 --> 00:42:33,472

00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:36,876
