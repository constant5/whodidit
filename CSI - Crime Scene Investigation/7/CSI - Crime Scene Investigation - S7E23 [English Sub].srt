00:00:02,542 --> 00:00:05,879
(spurs jingling)

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,086
(thunder rumbling)

00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:25,532
(jangling spurs
approaching)

00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:29,769
(thunder crashing)

00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:36,442
You're late.

00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:47,453
Now say it.

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,256
(tinny piano playing off-key)

00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:55,929
I said... say it.

00:00:55,995 --> 00:00:57,330
You have to say it.

00:00:57,397 --> 00:00:59,833
Say it.

00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:01,234
(gagging)

00:01:04,871 --> 00:01:06,673
Is she going
to be okay?

00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:08,408
Yes, ma'am,
she's stable.

00:01:08,475 --> 00:01:09,843
Severe trauma to the neck.

00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:11,211
Heather, I'm Catherine Willows.

00:01:11,277 --> 00:01:12,979
I don't know if you remember me.

00:01:14,414 --> 00:01:15,882
It's going to be all right.

00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,156
Like a bad penny, some people
just keep showing up.

00:01:23,223 --> 00:01:25,959
Did you call Grissom?

00:01:29,128 --> 00:01:30,129
Who found her?

00:01:30,196 --> 00:01:31,197
Guy over there

00:01:31,264 --> 00:01:32,932
in the ten gallon--
Vernon Porter.

00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:34,834
He's a night watchman.

00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:37,537
All the employees are required
to wear that cowboy getup.

00:01:37,604 --> 00:01:41,174
That's the job that
cops get after they retire.

00:01:41,241 --> 00:01:43,309
You've got something
to look forward to, Jim.

00:01:43,376 --> 00:01:47,514
(piano playing jaunty tune)
Yes, ma'am.

00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,483
WILLOWS:
Chewing tobacco. Looks fresh.

00:01:54,053 --> 00:01:56,456
(piano playing)

00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,766
Lady Heather has
a house for this.

00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:09,536
Why take her show
on the road?

00:02:09,602 --> 00:02:12,272
Do you think you
know how to...?
Yeah.

00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,810
(piano stops)

00:02:16,876 --> 00:02:19,379
Oh, you're a genius.

00:02:19,445 --> 00:02:21,314
Well, this is
where we found her.

00:02:21,381 --> 00:02:22,882
WILLOWS:
Did she have
ligature marks?

00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:24,551
On her neck, yeah.

00:02:24,617 --> 00:02:26,753
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,754
She was a dominatrix.

00:02:27,821 --> 00:02:30,190
Not a submissive.

00:02:30,256 --> 00:02:32,425
Maybe the party just got
out of control.

00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:36,229
Or somebody didn't know
the rules.

How you doing?

00:03:10,968 --> 00:03:12,970
These files are
out of control.

00:03:13,037 --> 00:03:14,805
Typos, white-outs,
names missing,

00:03:14,872 --> 00:03:16,774
whole sections missing.
20 years ago,

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,442
the county was still
using typewriters.

00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:19,443
Did you find anything?

00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,378
Ernie Dell's foster child.

00:03:21,445 --> 00:03:22,580
Donna Catalani.

00:03:22,646 --> 00:03:25,149
Lived with the
Dells for a year.

00:03:25,216 --> 00:03:27,184
Her CASA report came
with a supplemental.

00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:28,752
They forgot to black out
her social security number.

00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:30,788
We can use that
to track her down,

00:03:30,855 --> 00:03:32,957
unless the adoptives
changed it.

00:03:33,023 --> 00:03:34,258
Good. I'll run it.

00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:35,926
I have to pull you off of this.

00:03:35,993 --> 00:03:37,661
Days is down to four CSIs.

00:03:37,728 --> 00:03:38,662
You're on loan-out.

00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:40,865
Why can't Days keep anybody?

00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:42,967
Money, stress, Ecklie, maybe.

00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:45,569
Just help them
with their backlog.

00:03:48,172 --> 00:03:50,474
So you're sure that
the gate was locked?

00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,610
I come on at 6:00
when Oakley's closes.

00:03:52,676 --> 00:03:55,179
The first thing I do
is lock the gate.

00:03:55,246 --> 00:03:58,849
Make my rounds
every two hours.

00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,018
8:00, 10:00, 12:00--

00:04:01,085 --> 00:04:03,521
everything was Code 4.

00:04:03,587 --> 00:04:04,989
When did things go Code 3?

00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:08,158
Found the main gate unlocked
at 0214.

00:04:08,225 --> 00:04:10,194
Went to check out the street,
heard that music.

00:04:10,261 --> 00:04:14,532
Found her on the floor,
called it in.

00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:17,535
SIDLE:
This is a family theme park.

00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:20,804
I'm assuming they don't
actually serve alcohol here.

00:04:20,871 --> 00:04:23,374
Must have brought their own.

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,043
Single malt, 30 years old.

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,878
S &amp; M is a rich man's sport.

00:04:27,945 --> 00:04:30,214
Kind of like hockey--
a lot of equipment.

00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:32,917
How much do you think
a night like this would cost?

00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:36,086
Heather told me, five years ago,
she was clearing

00:04:36,153 --> 00:04:37,721
20 grand a week.

00:04:37,788 --> 00:04:40,124
And that was before
ladyheather.com.

00:04:42,193 --> 00:04:44,895
What is she like?

00:04:44,962 --> 00:04:47,531
Beautiful...

00:04:47,598 --> 00:04:49,700
smart, intense...

00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:52,002
charming.

00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:54,205
The only woman I've ever seen
rattle Grissom.

00:04:54,271 --> 00:04:57,107
I mean, he kind
of liked that

00:04:57,174 --> 00:05:00,244
forensic anthropologist,
Terry Miller.

00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:01,779
Remember her?

00:05:01,846 --> 00:05:03,147
Yeah.

00:05:03,214 --> 00:05:07,418
But she wasn't enough
of a challenge for him.

00:05:07,484 --> 00:05:10,354
Heather, on the other hand...

00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:15,059
uninhibited and can beat him
at mental chess.

00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:19,396
They had chemistry.

00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:21,732
And he is a scientist.

00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:25,369
I have no proof
and I know he'd
never tell me,

00:05:25,436 --> 00:05:27,071
but I'm certain they
spent the night together.

00:05:27,137 --> 00:05:30,107
Wonder which one
wore the chaps.

00:05:30,174 --> 00:05:32,276
Lots of... (clears throat)
...coins and toothpicks.

00:05:32,343 --> 00:05:34,411
They don't sweep under here.

00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:35,946
I mean, more power
to him, really,

00:05:36,013 --> 00:05:38,015
to find somebody outside of work

00:05:38,082 --> 00:05:41,752
'cause you start fishing
from the company pier, and...

00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:43,888
asking for trouble.

00:05:43,954 --> 00:05:46,490
I got a shot glass.

00:05:46,557 --> 00:05:49,460
Looks like there's some
lipstick around the rim.

00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:52,830
My fantasy does not
include costumes,
or pain...

00:05:52,897 --> 00:05:55,766
and certainly
not sawdust.

00:05:57,902 --> 00:05:59,103
You?

00:06:01,005 --> 00:06:03,841
CURTIS:
<i>Patrol found her.</i>

00:06:03,908 --> 00:06:05,209
Any witnesses?

00:06:05,276 --> 00:06:09,413
No. No businesses open,
no cars on the side streets.

00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,348
So how'd she get here?

00:06:11,415 --> 00:06:13,817
CURTIS:
Well, in this
neighborhood,

00:06:13,884 --> 00:06:15,653
unless she's a hooker,
I doubt she walked.

00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:17,388
I'm going to go
make some calls,

00:06:17,454 --> 00:06:18,622
see if any of
these places

00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:20,457
have any security cameras.

00:06:20,524 --> 00:06:22,159
Thanks.

00:06:22,226 --> 00:06:25,763
That's a pretty nasty
head wound.

00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:26,964
Where's Super Dave?

00:06:27,031 --> 00:06:29,500
He's probably at the 420
on Flamingo.

00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:31,202
They left their purse.

00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,405
Oh!

00:06:34,471 --> 00:06:35,839
The thing is heavier
than my kid.

00:06:35,906 --> 00:06:37,975
Ever get hit in the head
with one of these?

00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:41,579
No. Gentlemen don't get hit
in the head with those.

00:06:41,645 --> 00:06:42,813
BROWN:
Gentlemen...

00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,986
Keysha Sayrun?

00:06:49,053 --> 00:06:50,321
Well, that's not her.

00:06:50,387 --> 00:06:52,256
Maybe it's not her purse.

00:06:52,323 --> 00:06:54,124
BROWN:
There's a whole bunch
of wallets in here.

00:06:54,191 --> 00:06:57,027
Driver's permit.

00:06:57,094 --> 00:07:00,531
Kid's only 15--
has got a credit card?

00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:02,633
She's got to be
a pickpocket.

00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,235
Aw, man, that's a shame.

00:07:04,301 --> 00:07:05,569
Look at her.

00:07:05,636 --> 00:07:07,671
She could be anything
she wanted to be.

00:07:07,738 --> 00:07:09,907
Makes you wonder
what happens to people.

00:07:09,974 --> 00:07:11,041
I got her.

00:07:11,108 --> 00:07:12,977
Faith Maroney.

00:07:13,043 --> 00:07:15,179
Twenty-five...

00:07:15,246 --> 00:07:17,681
from Southern Highlands.

00:07:17,748 --> 00:07:20,050
Sometimes I miss the days
when I didn't take this job

00:07:20,117 --> 00:07:22,319
so personally, Warrick.

00:07:22,386 --> 00:07:24,722
Yeah? Well, I miss
the days

00:07:24,788 --> 00:07:26,624
when we only had
five homicides a week.

00:07:37,735 --> 00:07:42,072
(phone ringing)

00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:43,974
Grissom.

00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,243
Catherine.

00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,579
I'm on my way.

00:07:51,982 --> 00:07:54,118
I was planning
an Old West party.

00:07:54,185 --> 00:07:57,054
I was checking out
the facilities.

00:07:57,121 --> 00:07:59,423
So why couldn't you
check them out during
normal business hours?

00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,724
It was my normal
business hours.

00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,393
You know, we spoke
to the night watchman.

00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:05,262
He said the gate was locked.
How did you get in?

00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:06,630
I know the owner.

00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:08,599
Do you know him the way
you know Judge Fincher?

00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,935
Because I know
that's how you got
out of jail last time.

00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:12,269
I need a name.

00:08:12,336 --> 00:08:13,571
Mr. Oakley.

00:08:13,637 --> 00:08:15,506
I have his number,
but not on me.

00:08:15,573 --> 00:08:17,074
You'll have to look it up.
(knocking)

00:08:17,141 --> 00:08:19,043
Hi.

00:08:19,109 --> 00:08:20,211
I'm with the crime lab.

00:08:20,277 --> 00:08:21,946
Sara Sidle.

00:08:22,012 --> 00:08:24,281
I'm here to
collect your clothes

00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:26,450
and trace evidence
from your body.

00:08:26,517 --> 00:08:28,285
Can I say no?

00:08:28,352 --> 00:08:30,521
Why would you want to?

00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:33,924
Did the nurse forget
to collect an SAE kit?

00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:35,593
Not necessary.

00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,328
You don't want help,
that's okay by me.

00:08:37,394 --> 00:08:39,163
Just don't waste
my time.

00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,966
I've got a lot of cases
on my desk that need
my attention.

00:08:42,032 --> 00:08:45,536
So when you come out
of your haze, give me a call.

00:08:47,972 --> 00:08:49,673
(door closing)

00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:53,944
I don't respond well to men
who judge me

00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:57,114
based solely on my profession.

00:08:57,181 --> 00:08:59,183
I get that a lot, too.

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,784
Law enforcement.

00:09:05,422 --> 00:09:07,358
May I move your hair?

00:09:22,006 --> 00:09:24,208
These look like rope marks
on your neck.

00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,913
Grissom.

00:09:33,517 --> 00:09:35,553
I'll be done in a minute.

00:09:39,543 --> 00:09:41,178
(yawns)

00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:43,848
What's the matter, Doc,
you been hitting it
a little too hard?

00:09:43,914 --> 00:09:45,983
No, canine-induced
insomnia.

00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,352
We're fostering some
puppies-- Jack Russells.

00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:49,954
Had me up all night.

00:09:50,021 --> 00:09:51,756
How about a puppy
to keep you company?

00:09:51,822 --> 00:09:53,090
No, if I stay up all night,

00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:54,859
it's not going to be
because of a puppy.

00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:56,627
C.O.D.?

00:09:56,694 --> 00:09:59,163
Okay, blunt
force trauma

00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,265
to the left temporal
region of the skull.

00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:03,000
The skull's fractured.

00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:05,002
Any idea what kind of weapon
might have been used?

00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:08,706
No, but I found these
imbedded in the skull.

00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:13,444
Paint chips?

00:10:13,511 --> 00:10:14,545
Could she have been

00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:16,447
hit by a car?
Well, it's possible.

00:10:16,514 --> 00:10:18,716
But if she was standing
when she was hit,

00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:21,619
I'd expect to find pedestrian
fractures on her legs.

00:10:21,686 --> 00:10:23,154
And there are no
run-over marks,

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,855
so she wasn't in
a prone position.

00:10:24,922 --> 00:10:27,792
So if she wasn't standing
or lying down...

00:10:27,858 --> 00:10:30,027
She was somewhere
in-between.

00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:33,230
Stokes, you ready
for a cup of coffee?

00:10:33,297 --> 00:10:36,267
No, thanks.
I'm only going to be

00:10:36,334 --> 00:10:38,169
about another ten minutes here,
okay?

00:10:38,235 --> 00:10:39,737
Your call.

00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,218
Hey.

00:10:54,285 --> 00:10:56,887
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:10:56,954 --> 00:10:58,522
You all right, man?

00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:00,124
You all right?

00:11:08,566 --> 00:11:12,837
Are you here in
a professional capacity?

00:11:12,903 --> 00:11:15,172
Does it make
a difference?

00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:17,174
Maybe not to you.

00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:19,377
I feel exposed.

00:11:19,443 --> 00:11:21,312
The last time
you saw me...

00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:23,114
You had just lost your daughter.

00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,217
That's not all
I lost that night.

00:11:29,286 --> 00:11:31,722
Heather!

00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:34,225
If a client did this,

00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,128
and left you to die,

00:11:37,194 --> 00:11:39,030
why are you protecting him?

00:11:39,096 --> 00:11:40,798
I'm not.

00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:42,967
Tell me the truth.

00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,639
Did they check your glucose
level when you came in?

00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:52,109
Heather?

00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:56,247
She's diabetic.
I think she's going into shock.

00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:58,115
The patient
never told us.

00:12:01,452 --> 00:12:04,989
Captain, I'll need a copy
of the police report

00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:06,324
for my insurance.

00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,526
Oh, sure, sure, sure.
We'll get to that.

00:12:08,592 --> 00:12:11,629
But, first, I need to

00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:14,498
straighten out
a few things.
Mr. Oakley,

00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:16,567
did you give Heather Kessler
permission

00:12:16,634 --> 00:12:17,902
to enter the park after hours?

00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:19,403
No, I didn't.
I did.

00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,771
She called the office.
Wanted to know about

00:12:20,838 --> 00:12:22,306
renting out Oakley's Saloon
for a private party.

00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:24,942
Well, you know what she does
for a living, right?

00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:26,110
Money's money--
doesn't matter who's

00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:27,478
handing it to you,
right, Dad?

00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:29,413
As long as you're
not breaking the law.

00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,848
So you have no problem

00:12:30,915 --> 00:12:33,484
with a dominatrix doing business
at a family theme park?

00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:37,421
Captain, sometimes, my son,
he... he doesn't think
things all the way through.

00:12:37,488 --> 00:12:39,757
But I'm learning.

00:12:39,824 --> 00:12:41,425
So how did she get in?

00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:43,761
I swung by.
Wanted to meet her.

00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:45,363
After midnight?
Yeah.

00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:47,698
Told her to lock up
when she was done.

00:12:47,765 --> 00:12:48,766
You should have stayed, Ben.

00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:49,967
You got liability
to think about.

00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:52,803
Right, Dad.
'Cause you always do.

00:12:55,773 --> 00:12:58,309
Captain, is this about it?

00:12:58,376 --> 00:13:00,144
Well, I'd like to talk
to Benny a little more.

00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:02,013
We need
to confirm his statement.

00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:29,106
(camera clicking)

00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:58,102
(camera clicking)

00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:02,873
There were no security cameras
at the crime scene,

00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,809
but Ms. Maroney
had multiple arrests

00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,777
for petty theft and shoplifting.

00:14:06,844 --> 00:14:09,947
She had just been released
on court-ordered rehab

00:14:10,014 --> 00:14:11,716
for kleptomania.

00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:13,284
She got noodles,
hairpins,

00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:16,253
dish towels, a can of tuna.

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,422
She didn't care what she took.

00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:19,957
She just had to take it.

00:14:20,024 --> 00:14:21,258
You know, I was thinking.

00:14:21,325 --> 00:14:23,494
If she pinched my wallet,
and I whacked her for it,

00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:25,930
I'd probably get back my wallet
before I split.

00:14:25,997 --> 00:14:28,933
Which means the theft victims
are probably not the suspects.

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,301
Got anything else?

00:14:30,368 --> 00:14:33,437
A couple of loose receipts,
all from last night,

00:14:33,504 --> 00:14:35,439
all paid in cash.
A pack of gum

00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:37,775
from the Bargain Bin, a soda

00:14:37,842 --> 00:14:41,045
from Carlisa's, 
and a Bloody Mary
from Diane's Steakhouse.

00:14:41,112 --> 00:14:44,782
Which is less than quarter
of a mile from the crime scene.

00:14:44,849 --> 00:14:47,418
At 9:52 p.m.

00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:48,986
Patrol found her
just after 11:00.

00:14:49,053 --> 00:14:50,855
I'll start at the steakhouse
and backtrack.

00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:19,517
Hey.
Hey.

00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,852
What? Have you been shaving
with a broken beer bottle?

00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:25,156
No, no. Some drunk driver
ran into a radio car

00:15:25,222 --> 00:15:26,757
at my crime scene.
Friggin' idiot.

00:15:26,824 --> 00:15:29,026
Yeah. I heard you pulled
the friggin' idiot's friend

00:15:29,093 --> 00:15:30,361
out of a burning car.

00:15:30,428 --> 00:15:31,495
Nothing was on fire.

00:15:31,562 --> 00:15:32,863
I didn't pull anybody
from anywhere.

00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,165
Oh, so humble.

00:15:34,231 --> 00:15:36,634
You know, some people are just
destined for greatness.

00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:41,505
Run these against the paint
chips from the body, please.

00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:45,810
Sure. You mean the engine black
over canary yellow paint chips

00:15:45,876 --> 00:15:47,812
from a Ford automobile? Yeah.

00:15:47,878 --> 00:15:49,280
If I had a yellow car,
I'd paint over it, too.

00:15:49,347 --> 00:15:52,483
So the victim <i>was</i> hit by a car.

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,989
Steakhouse called
Faith Maroney a cab.

00:15:58,055 --> 00:16:00,391
They have a direct line
to this place.

00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,593
Well, the car that hit her
was yellow and black.

00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,228
Paint color's
not going to help us

00:16:04,295 --> 00:16:06,330
narrow it down any, is it?
No.

00:16:06,397 --> 00:16:07,832
You guys from Strip-O-Gram?

00:16:07,898 --> 00:16:09,533
Excuse me?

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,935
'Cause last year,
for my birthday,

00:16:11,002 --> 00:16:12,503
a cop showed up
with a phony badge,

00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:18,209
started tearing his clothes off
and trying to rub up on me.

00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:20,244
I'm an excellent tipper.

00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:21,746
Well, I'm sure you are,
but, uh,

00:16:21,812 --> 00:16:23,047
no, ma'am, we're
not dancers.

00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:24,181
We're here about
the warrant.

00:16:24,248 --> 00:16:27,251
Okay, then.

00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:28,586
So we dispatched

00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:30,655
20 cabs to Diane's Steakhouse
last night.

00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:31,822
Around 10:00?

00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:33,658
Received a call
at 10:01.

00:16:33,724 --> 00:16:35,393
Dispatched number 29.

00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:36,994
Chandru Kambhatla.

00:16:37,061 --> 00:16:38,529
He doesn't come on until 8:00.

00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:41,632
Well, we're going to need to see
that cab and your trip sheet.

00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,534
Number 29's right there.

00:16:43,601 --> 00:16:45,303
Keys are inside.

00:16:45,369 --> 00:16:46,804
No joy riding,

00:16:46,871 --> 00:16:50,007
and don't leave the doors off
like you did last time.

00:16:50,074 --> 00:16:52,276
Hey, we just take them apart.

00:16:52,343 --> 00:16:53,444
We don't put them
back together, now.

00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:56,013
That's why nobody likes
to deal with your asses!

00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,649
(both laughing)

00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,955
Hey, Nick,
there's a camera in here.

00:17:05,022 --> 00:17:06,457
Maybe that'll be able
to tell us

00:17:06,524 --> 00:17:08,626
if Princess Pickpocket
was one of his fares.

00:17:13,097 --> 00:17:16,367
Front bumper screens positive
for blood.

00:17:16,434 --> 00:17:18,703
Hey.

00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:22,206
I got robbed last week,
filed a report.

00:17:22,273 --> 00:17:24,308
How come you're helping
Chandru and not me?

00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,077
This isn't a robbery, sir.

00:17:26,143 --> 00:17:27,244
Then, what is it?

00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:28,946
Do you know the guy
that drives this cab?

00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:30,247
Sure.

00:17:30,314 --> 00:17:31,983
You see him last night?
I had to cut out early.

00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:33,084
My wife's sick.

00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,652
But, uh, Dru's solid.

00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,287
Got to respect a guy
who comes here

00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:37,755
and wants
to be legit.

00:17:37,822 --> 00:17:41,592
Goes to work, pays his taxes,
studying to be a citizen.

00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:43,894
If you want to know about state
capitals, you just ask Dru.

00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:45,630
Did you know
that Vegas

00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:47,431
is not the
capital of Nevada?

00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:49,333
Thanks for the info, fellas.

00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,836
Go get 'em.

00:18:02,046 --> 00:18:04,515
(siren wailing in distance)

00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:05,750
WILLOWS:
<i>The substance that I found</i>

00:18:05,816 --> 00:18:07,985
under the saloon window
was chewing tobacco.

00:18:08,052 --> 00:18:08,986
The night watchman chews.

00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:10,187
Yeah, Vernon Porter.

00:18:10,254 --> 00:18:12,056
He was fired from the
force back in Chicago.

00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:13,924
Yeah, I know,
I checked him out.
Oh.

00:18:13,991 --> 00:18:15,893
He got
in an off-duty incident.

00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,130
He was in a fight in a bar
and a woman was hospitalized.

00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:20,831
I'm thinking he had
a front row seat.

00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:23,067
Well, you know,
it fits his profile.

00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:25,836
He could have waited
till Heather's client left--

00:18:25,903 --> 00:18:26,871
there's always a client...
Yeah.

00:18:26,937 --> 00:18:28,539
...and then attacked her.

00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:30,441
You know,
I should have checked

00:18:30,508 --> 00:18:31,876
to see if he was
wearing underwear.

00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:33,577
There's no way that
he could afford her.

00:18:33,644 --> 00:18:35,713
So why would Heather
cover for him?

00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,882
Unless he's
just a witness.

00:18:37,948 --> 00:18:41,185
Well, you want to see a man
about a horse?

00:18:44,555 --> 00:18:46,290
GRISSOM:
Any results
on Heather Kessler?

00:18:46,357 --> 00:18:48,659
So far, all the prints
come back to her.

00:18:48,726 --> 00:18:51,395
Player piano, whiskey
bottle, shot glass.

00:18:51,462 --> 00:18:54,165
There was some lipstick
around the rim.

00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:56,167
I haven't had a
chance to test it.

00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:58,736
You think it's
her shade?

00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:02,873
Heather's not supposed to
drink because of her diabetes,

00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,577
which could explain
the hypoglycemia and shock.

00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:10,514
Catherine found a pair
of men's underwear
in the toilet.

00:19:10,581 --> 00:19:13,417
Any evidence on them would
have been washed away,

00:19:13,484 --> 00:19:15,786
but she also found
seminal fluid

00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:18,055
in a tissue on
the floor nearby.

00:19:18,122 --> 00:19:19,991
She was sexually assaulted?

00:19:20,057 --> 00:19:22,326
She refused an SAE kit,
so we'll never know.

00:19:22,393 --> 00:19:24,395
There were no
defensive wounds,

00:19:24,462 --> 00:19:27,098
no skin or rope fibers
under her nails.

00:19:27,164 --> 00:19:28,933
At first blush, I figured
he might have ambushed her,

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,836
except that I noted
three separate

00:19:31,902 --> 00:19:33,938
strangulation
attempts on her neck.

00:19:36,073 --> 00:19:38,009
She had time to fight back.

00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:40,211
This makes no sense.

00:19:40,277 --> 00:19:41,846
She's very strong.

00:19:41,912 --> 00:19:44,081
And tough as nails.

00:19:44,148 --> 00:19:46,350
Why didn't she fight?

00:19:47,351 --> 00:19:49,420
Gate's unlocked again.

00:19:49,487 --> 00:19:51,422
Well, it's ten after.

00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:53,090
Probably unlocked
'cause he's doing his rounds.

00:19:53,157 --> 00:19:54,425
Maybe.

00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:55,760
Ah, the Wild West,
partner.

00:19:55,826 --> 00:19:57,762
Okay, come on,
Jim, give it up.

00:19:57,828 --> 00:19:58,763
I know you
know something

00:19:58,829 --> 00:20:00,031
about Grissom
and Lady Heather.

00:20:00,097 --> 00:20:03,734
I know something a lot juicier
than Grissom and Lady He...

00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:16,714
Oh, yeah, he's dead.

00:20:16,781 --> 00:20:18,783
He took one in the back.

00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:21,385
Who shot the sheriff?

00:20:24,498 --> 00:20:26,400
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:29,103
Bullet entered
through his back.

00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,605
(grunts)

00:20:31,672 --> 00:20:33,407
No exit wound.

00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:36,710
There's some swelling
under his lip.

00:20:37,745 --> 00:20:39,547
Ugh, disgusting.

00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,449
You get mouth cancer from this.

00:20:41,515 --> 00:20:42,950
David, hand me his cell phone.

00:20:43,017 --> 00:20:45,052
Sure.

00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,121
Ruger Single Six.

00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,093
Gun hasn't been fired.

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,627
Guess who he called yesterday?

00:20:53,694 --> 00:20:55,529
Lady Heather.

00:20:55,596 --> 00:20:57,298
Might have threatened her.
And we both know

00:20:57,364 --> 00:20:59,433
how she likes
to settle her own scores.

00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,535
I'm going to
get a warrant,

00:21:01,602 --> 00:21:03,037
but it may take me some time

00:21:03,104 --> 00:21:06,173
because I have to find a judge
who isn't a client of hers.

00:21:08,676 --> 00:21:11,545
STOKES:
You sure you've never
seen her before?

00:21:11,612 --> 00:21:12,613
You don't
remember her?

00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,748
No, sir.
That picture

00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,616
was taken by the
camera inside your cab.

00:21:15,683 --> 00:21:16,917
Why don't you
take another look?

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,287
Recognize her now?

00:21:20,354 --> 00:21:23,190
You know, a lot of
people get in my cab.

00:21:23,257 --> 00:21:25,659
There's always a big
convention in town.

00:21:25,726 --> 00:21:29,930
Hey. Dru. I was born at night,
but not last night, okay?

00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:33,000
You picked her up
at the steakhouse.

00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:34,201
I know the last time
she was seen alive,

00:21:34,268 --> 00:21:35,903
was in your yellow cab.

00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,406
I know she was killed
by a yellow car.

00:21:38,472 --> 00:21:40,474
I found blood on your
front bumper.

00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,878
Okay, I, uh, I remember her now.

00:21:43,944 --> 00:21:46,580
She wanted to go to MGM.

00:21:46,647 --> 00:21:48,182
There is bad traffic,

00:21:48,249 --> 00:21:50,418
so she tells me
to let her out.

00:21:50,484 --> 00:21:51,952
She wants to walk.

00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,387
Where'd you let her out?

00:21:54,889 --> 00:21:56,824
Near the Monte Carlo.

00:21:56,891 --> 00:21:58,025
Mr. Kambhatla,

00:21:58,092 --> 00:21:59,827
if I match the paint
from your cab

00:21:59,894 --> 00:22:01,495
to the paint
we found in her skull,

00:22:01,562 --> 00:22:03,264
do you realize how much
trouble you're in?

00:22:04,298 --> 00:22:06,600
'Cause I'm not sure
you really do.

00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:09,770
Scotty.

00:22:17,011 --> 00:22:19,380
JOHNSON:
The older types of cameras
only take stills.

00:22:19,447 --> 00:22:21,515
They take them sequentially
for 20 seconds

00:22:21,582 --> 00:22:23,484
any time a passenger
door is opened.

00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:24,718
Can you clarify
the background?

00:22:24,785 --> 00:22:25,886
Yeah.

00:22:28,255 --> 00:22:30,724
NICK:
I recognize the
graphitti on that bench.

00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:33,527
That's the street we found
her on, right there.

00:22:33,594 --> 00:22:35,396
So Mr. Kambhatla
was lying.

00:22:35,463 --> 00:22:37,598
That's nowhere near
the Monte Carlo.

00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,537
Go back to number two.

00:22:44,772 --> 00:22:47,141
The wallet in her
hand is... black.

00:22:49,777 --> 00:22:51,412
And her wallet was white.

00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,249
Go back, show me the last
three photos, Archie.

00:22:55,316 --> 00:22:56,383
Yeah.

00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,953
JOHNSON:
Okay, so he's looking at her.

00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:00,154
Looks down.

00:23:00,221 --> 00:23:01,388
He's looking
for something.

00:23:01,455 --> 00:23:02,356
He looks up.

00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:03,591
STOKES:
Well, he's pissed.

00:23:03,657 --> 00:23:05,860
So she <i>did</i> snatch
his wallet after all.

00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,229
BROWN:
And he ran her down
and took it back.

00:23:08,295 --> 00:23:10,097
Well, we have
him in custody.

00:23:10,164 --> 00:23:12,399
We have his wallet.

00:23:12,466 --> 00:23:15,703
Let's, uh, go see if
her prints are on it.

00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:16,971
Yeah. Thanks, Arch.

00:23:17,037 --> 00:23:18,139
Yeah.

00:23:24,578 --> 00:23:26,580
This window wasn't
broken yesterday.

00:23:26,647 --> 00:23:29,350
And I got a bullet
in a poker player.

00:23:29,417 --> 00:23:33,053
Well, the one that killed
Porter's still inside him.

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,722
Porter was shot
in the back.

00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:37,458
He was facing away
from the saloon.

00:23:37,525 --> 00:23:40,261
(gunshot)

00:23:40,327 --> 00:23:42,530
To get to the window,
this bullet had to be fired

00:23:42,596 --> 00:23:44,098
from the opposite direction.

00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:46,467
(gunshot)

00:23:47,868 --> 00:23:49,670
There were
two shooters.

00:23:55,209 --> 00:23:58,112
Lead bullet. Cannelure.

00:23:58,179 --> 00:23:59,880
We're looking
for a revolver.

00:24:15,096 --> 00:24:16,997
Oh, wow.

00:24:17,064 --> 00:24:20,601
WILLOWS:
These look authentic.

00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:22,503
All revolvers.

00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,338
Case is unlocked.

00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,442
I'll get the guns to ballistics.

00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,811
I'll process the ammo boxes.

00:24:30,878 --> 00:24:32,680
Sofia,
Faith Maroney's prints

00:24:32,747 --> 00:24:34,215
were found on the cab
driver's wallet

00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:35,349
so there's your motive.

00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:36,751
No problem.

00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,728
The paint from
the dead girl's skull

00:24:47,795 --> 00:24:49,463
matched the paint
on Chandru's cab.

00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,432
Page two.

00:24:53,801 --> 00:24:56,036
The paint chips from the street
are <i>not</i> a match

00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:57,471
to the paint chips
from her skull.

00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:58,773
Are you sure about this?

00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:02,209
I just finished a diabolical
soduku in six minutes flat.

00:25:02,276 --> 00:25:03,644
I'm positive.

00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,513
Then what color were
the other paint chips?

00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:07,114
What did you have for lunch?

00:25:07,181 --> 00:25:08,816
<i>I</i> had a ham
sandwich.

00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:09,884
Hmm?

00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,285
It's a clue.

00:25:11,352 --> 00:25:12,720
Your sandwich.

00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:14,822
Oh.

00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:15,990
The paint chips

00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,792
you collected are
from two different cars,

00:25:17,858 --> 00:25:20,294
stuck together as a
result of impact.

00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:22,830
Yellow paint, black
paint, clear coat.

00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:24,198
The other half--
clear coat,

00:25:24,265 --> 00:25:26,834
black paint, yellow paint,
clear coat, white.

00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:30,171
That's a lot of canary yellow
and engine black.

00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,705
Cab-on-cab hate?

00:25:31,772 --> 00:25:34,008
One half of the sandwich
is from Dru's 29.

00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:35,576
What about the other half?

00:25:35,643 --> 00:25:37,311
You're looking
for a white Ford

00:25:37,378 --> 00:25:38,813
that's been repainted
yellow and black.

00:25:38,879 --> 00:25:41,382
Sweet.

00:25:41,449 --> 00:25:43,584
I'm glad I figured that out.

00:25:43,651 --> 00:25:47,488
C.O.D.'s a single gunshot wound
to the lower lumbar region.

00:25:47,555 --> 00:25:50,858
Bullet entered here and then
traveled slightly upward.

00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:52,193
Where <i>is</i> the bullet?

00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,594
Well, that's
the fun part.

00:25:53,661 --> 00:25:55,596
He didn't die from
the initial wound.

00:25:55,663 --> 00:25:57,832
It entered through his back

00:25:57,898 --> 00:26:00,101
and then penetrated
the inferior vena cava.

00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:02,803
(gunshot)

00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:06,674
<i>It traveled through</i> that <i>vessel</i>
<i>into his right lung.</i>

00:26:06,741 --> 00:26:08,242
<i>It's called a bullet embolus.</i>

00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:09,810
and it's hard to find.

00:26:09,877 --> 00:26:12,747
Most medical examiners
would have missed it.

00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,519
Full metal jacket,
nine millimeter.

00:26:18,586 --> 00:26:21,689
The bullet that I found at the
saloon was from a revolver.

00:26:21,756 --> 00:26:22,690
Colt single-action Army.

00:26:22,757 --> 00:26:24,225
The gun that won the west.

00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,226
That bullet is from

00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,894
a 20th century,
high-capacity,

00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:28,362
semi-automatic pistol.

00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:30,965
I... see a lot of bullets.

00:26:39,106 --> 00:26:41,041
(sighs)

00:26:41,108 --> 00:26:43,377
Well, it looks like Friendly

00:26:43,444 --> 00:26:45,179
bought a small fleet
of white cabs

00:26:45,246 --> 00:26:47,848
from another company last
year that went belly-up.

00:26:47,915 --> 00:26:49,250
How small are
we talking?

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,854
Seventy-five.

00:26:53,921 --> 00:26:56,791
Paint samples
from 75 cabs?

00:26:56,857 --> 00:26:59,193
Well, we'll be back in
the lab by next week.

00:27:35,596 --> 00:27:36,630
Hey, Warrick.

00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:39,133
I got what looks like
fresh damage over here.

00:27:44,238 --> 00:27:45,339
Do we know that guy?

00:27:48,275 --> 00:27:50,845
JOHNSON:
Gus's cab is equipped
with a new camera.

00:27:50,911 --> 00:27:52,179
Video, not stills.

00:27:52,246 --> 00:27:53,214
Motion-activated.

00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,149
So the impact
turns it on, huh?

00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:57,618
STOKES:
Freeze that and grab
a number off that cab.

00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,958
JOHNSON:
7029-- that's Dru's cab.

00:28:04,024 --> 00:28:06,460
If Dru was dispatched,
then what was Gus doing

00:28:06,527 --> 00:28:07,495
at that steakhouse?

00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,463
Well, he had to be staging,

00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:11,031
trying to steal Dru's fare.

00:28:11,098 --> 00:28:13,000
Looks like Gus took
the fight to the streets.

00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:14,935
He hit him again right there.

00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,339
BROWN:
Whoa.

00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:19,974
Well, that's the corner.

00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,476
And we know from the paint chips
we found on the ground

00:28:22,543 --> 00:28:25,346
that Gus's cab collided
with Dru's on that street.

00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:27,148
Well, the airbags
didn't deploy, so

00:28:27,214 --> 00:28:29,383
he must have been going
under 15 miles an hour.

00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,052
I can't see Dru's cab, so Gus

00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,821
must have rear-ended him
when he was stopped.

00:28:33,888 --> 00:28:34,989
STOKES:
It's physics.

00:28:35,055 --> 00:28:36,824
Gus's cab

00:28:36,891 --> 00:28:39,660
transferred most of its
energy into Dru's--

00:28:39,727 --> 00:28:42,363
more than enough to
launch him into the girl.

00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,031
and car bumpers
are designed

00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:45,566
to absorb the impact
from another vehicle,

00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:49,036
but the bumper hitting her?

00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:50,771
Would have been like a...

00:28:50,838 --> 00:28:52,440
<i>elephant hitting a flea.</i>

00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,276
You were in the wrong.

00:28:55,342 --> 00:28:56,777
You were the one
who was staging.

00:28:56,844 --> 00:28:59,780
So why road rage
Mr. Kambhatla?

00:28:59,847 --> 00:29:02,116
Because he was gonna
report it and get me fired.

00:29:02,183 --> 00:29:04,051
I'm two months from retirement.

00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:05,853
My wife's got MS.

00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,788
I <i>need</i> my health benefits.

00:29:07,855 --> 00:29:10,591
But I didn't
hit that girl.

00:29:10,658 --> 00:29:12,059
He did.

00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:14,295
STOKES:
It's a bad neighborhood.

00:29:14,361 --> 00:29:15,963
Nothing's open out there.

00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,698
So why'd you drop her off?

00:29:17,765 --> 00:29:20,601
She was screaming at me,
"Screw you, pull over."

00:29:22,603 --> 00:29:23,738
Sorry.

00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:25,973
You guys are crazy. I want out
of this cab right now.

00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:29,810
$6.25, please.

00:29:29,877 --> 00:29:31,545
No way. I'm not paying
for this ride.

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,981
Hey, wait!

00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:35,750
You're a tease!

00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:36,951
Give me back my wallet!

00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,756
He tries to steal my fare.

00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:44,592
She tries to steal my wallet,
and I am arrested.

00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,427
So why didn't you just
report the accident?

00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:48,796
You hit a pedestrian,
it is always your fault.

00:29:48,863 --> 00:29:51,832
Hey, you were stopped
and Gus hit you,

00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:54,435
pushing your cab into her.

00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:56,003
Now, that's not your fault.

00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,004
Okay?

00:29:57,071 --> 00:29:59,507
Gus said it was.

00:29:59,573 --> 00:30:02,843
And he has been driving
for 30 years.

00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:05,079
My cab hit her,
so I am guilty.

00:30:05,146 --> 00:30:07,515
Yeah, well, Gus doesn't
know the law, but I do.

00:30:07,581 --> 00:30:11,051
What else did
he say to you?

00:30:11,118 --> 00:30:12,520
Mr. Kambhatla,

00:30:12,586 --> 00:30:16,357
this may be the last chance you
have to tell me the truth, now.

00:30:20,594 --> 00:30:22,530
We made a deal.

00:30:22,596 --> 00:30:24,031
Okay. Okay.
What kind of deal?

00:30:24,098 --> 00:30:28,736
He said if I don't
report him for staging,

00:30:28,803 --> 00:30:32,073
and hitting me,

00:30:32,139 --> 00:30:35,943
then he would keep quiet
about me hitting the girl.

00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:41,549
And I can stay
in this country...

00:30:41,615 --> 00:30:43,818
with my mother and sisters.

00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:47,021
I need to be here to
make money for them.

00:30:47,088 --> 00:30:50,758
I'm telling the truth now.

00:30:50,825 --> 00:30:52,560
Is going to be okay, right?

00:30:52,626 --> 00:30:55,463
No, sir, unfortunately,
that's not the way it works.

00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:58,766
I've got you
for obstruction,

00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:01,902
for fleeing the scene,
and now you're an accessory.

00:31:01,969 --> 00:31:03,170
I'm sorry, man.

00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:06,173
I know you're confused, but...

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,375
you just made a deal
with the wrong guy.

00:31:23,457 --> 00:31:24,658
This isn't a good time.

00:31:24,725 --> 00:31:26,727
We have a warrant
to search your house.

00:31:26,794 --> 00:31:28,195
And you'd better
put some sunblock on

00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:29,597
because we're
going downtown.

00:31:29,663 --> 00:31:32,733
My memory isn't any better
than it was yesterday.

00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,436
I'm not up to it.

00:31:35,503 --> 00:31:36,670
Well, we'll swing
by the hospital.

00:31:36,737 --> 00:31:38,572
And you can explain to
them why you checked

00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:41,342
yourself out early,
against doctor's orders.

00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:43,077
We're investigating
a homicide.

00:31:43,144 --> 00:31:45,012
I don't understand.

00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,180
Where were you
last night?

00:31:46,247 --> 00:31:48,983
You may come in.

00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:53,421
I was here.

00:31:54,822 --> 00:31:56,791
Can anyone verify that?

00:31:56,857 --> 00:31:59,260
Preferably someone not
on the payroll.

00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:03,764
Captain Brass would like to know
where I was last night.

00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,937
She was here.

00:32:10,004 --> 00:32:12,073
GRISSOM:
With me.

00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,279
WILLOWS:
<i>You were there all night.</i>

00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:30,682
Want to explain why?

00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:32,517
Look, I know that

00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:35,887
you don't go home and cuddle
your insects every single night,

00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,689
but why would
you go there knowing

00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:39,424
that we're in the middle
of an investigation?

00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:41,793
And now she's a prime suspect
with you as her alibi.

00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,063
It was a social call,
that's all.

00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:50,235
So, when your personal life
gets tangled up in a case,

00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:51,603
that's off limits?

00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,704
Yes.

00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:54,706
Isn't that a little
hypocritical?

00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:56,241
Apparently so.

00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:59,077
You know I'd slap you, but
I think you'd enjoy it too much.

00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:04,749
Look, I went to Heather's
on a hunch.

00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,751
There's something

00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,487
not right with her.

00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,860
Your timing sucked.

00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,164
What's this?

00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,001
So now you're building
your own?

00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:24,269
Yeah.

00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,605
Keeps my hands busy.

00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,507
You think I paid someone
to kill Porter

00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:32,744
and then used Grissom
as my alibi?

00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:34,246
And with your history, yes.

00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:35,647
How do you know
Vernon Porter?

00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:37,182
He did some work for me.

00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:38,917
I helped him get the job
at Oakley's.

00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:40,952
You know what? That's the first
thing you said to me

00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,120
that doesn't sound like a lie.

00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,855
What kind of work?

00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:45,790
I needed to locate someone.

00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,826
So an ex-cop does
some legwork for you.

00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:49,628
So what happened--
did you have a falling out

00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,629
or he threaten you?

00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,763
(keypad beeping)

00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,365
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
First skipped message.

00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:55,600
Received yesterday at 12:02 p.m.

00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,602
MAN:
Hey, Heather, Vernon.

00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:59,204
Looks like you got yourself
into something.

00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:00,972
If you need anything, call me.

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,509
Call me anyway.
Let me know you're okay.

00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:05,777
Does that sound like a man

00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:07,245
who wants to hurt me,
Captain Brass?

00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:08,880
Oh, I don't know, Heather.
I don't know.

00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:12,183
I mean, you get assaulted
at Old West Town where he works,

00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,185
he calls it in,
then he ends up dead.

00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,288
What is it,
just one big coincidence?

00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,390
I already told you
I was there on business.

00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,058
Mr. Porter had nothing
to do with it.

00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:21,993
Yeah, but it was your business
that got him killed.

00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,461
Come on, come on,
we both know

00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,197
that you weren't there
for some Western hoedown.

00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:26,965
So what were you
doing there?

00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:30,702
The semen on the tissue

00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:33,171
in the bathroom
did not come from Vernon Porter.

00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:36,508
Well, the underwear
that I pulled from the toilet

00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,376
was a 38-inch waist.

00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,211
Porter was a 34.

00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,245
He didn't attack Heather.

00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:42,380
But we know he was there.

00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:46,384
One of Heather's clients pays
for a kinky Wild West fantasy

00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:49,054
only to discover he had
an audience?

00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,555
Well, I don't want
to derail this,

00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:52,490
but why kill Porter and not go
after Heather?

00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:53,491
'Cause she's
not talking.

00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,794
Her business
is based on discretion.

00:34:55,861 --> 00:34:57,596
Couldn't count on Porter's
discretion.

00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:58,897
(ring tone playing)

00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:01,333
So this client goes back
to Oakley's the next night

00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:02,968
and shoots Porter.

00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:07,072
Oh, Mandy got a hit
off the revolver
and the ammo box.

00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,074
Benjamin Oakley.

00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,976
His family owns the place.

00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,244
He had access.

00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,112
Yeah, I'm calling Brass.

00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:16,581
Sara will fill you in.

00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,950
WILLOWS:
Jim...

00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:20,719
We may have a suspect.

00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:29,060
I'm the only one
Heather trusts.

00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,263
I get it.

00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,299
Sara...

00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:37,235
Yeah?

00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,172
It's fine.

00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,408
Do what you need to do.

00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:58,590
HEATHER:
When the submissive accepts
they're in control,

00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:01,059
that's when they embrace
their true power.

00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:02,194
They can say "stop."

00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,962
They can choose
to either end the pain

00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:06,231
or continue enduring it.

00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:07,766
But...

00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,000
higher consciousness
doesn't negate

00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:11,503
our animal instinct to survive.

00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,439
Dr. Grissom,
you requested

00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:15,807
a custody file from the court.

00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:17,008
Thank you, Judy.

00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:19,244
I'm assuming it's for

00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:21,746
your investigation
into the Miniature Killer.

00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:25,517
Everybody in the lab
believes you're gonna get him.

00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:05,056
She's all I have left of Zoe.

00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:06,725
Can you tell if she's

00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,226
ever given birth?

00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:11,830
There was some scarring
on her pelvic bones,

00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,365
but given the condition
of the body,

00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:15,233
it's hard to say
for sure.

00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,869
GRISSOM:
This is your granddaughter.

00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:19,704
Did you take this picture?

00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:21,840
I hired someone to find her.

00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:25,176
I can't give her love,

00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,713
but I can give her the freedom
to be who she wants to be.

00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:36,187
Is this official
police business?

00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,756
No.

00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,090
Did Heather send you?

00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:41,927
No, I'm just a friend of hers.

00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,596
Did she tell you about me?

00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:46,031
Not really.

00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,732
We were married
very young.

00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:49,401
Didn't last long.

00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:53,271
Heather left
without telling me
she was pregnant.

00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:55,840
I wasn't aware I had a child

00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:58,143
until after Zoe
was already dead.

00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:03,415
That's Zoe's daughter,
Heather's granddaughter.

00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:06,418
Her name is Alison.

00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:09,054
So why are you here?

00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,890
I'm just trying to understand
what's happening to her.

00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:14,726
(girl speaking indistinctly)

00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:18,597
I'm aware that the court

00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:21,600
has denied her
visitation rights.

00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,735
Wouldn't you?

00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,604
I'm not sure.

00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,909
Has Heather tried to give you
any money for Alison?

00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:32,277
Yes, the day
before yesterday

00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:33,879
I got a call
from the bank.

00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:35,080
Heather had set up

00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,616
a very generous trust fund
for her,

00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:39,885
no strings attached.

00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:41,620
I assumed she sold her house.

00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,455
Can you tell me how much?

00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:46,558
$843,508.

00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:49,961
I know Heather had closed
her business a few months ago

00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:52,497
trying to convince the judge
she'd be a fit guardian,

00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:54,966
so it had to be from the sale.

00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:57,435
I wonder if she calculated

00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,504
the exact amount
it would cost

00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:02,807
to raise a child
and put her through college,

00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:05,510
especially at Harvard.

00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:10,015
That's where she sent Zoe.

00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,721
But it wasn't her house
that she sold.

00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:23,061
You took a shot at Porter.

00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:25,497
That's attempted murder.

00:39:25,564 --> 00:39:29,534
Your dad's not going
to like that, Benny.

00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:31,603
This is a warrant for your DNA.

00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,772
Why do you need my DNA?

00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:36,675
To prove that you also attacked
Heather Kessler.

00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:37,709
BRASS:
And that makes two
attempted murders.

00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:40,979
And that adds up to a
lot of jail time, bud.

00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:42,314
Open up.

00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,015
I didn't touch her, okay?

00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:46,384
I didn't kill Porter.

00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:47,986
What do you want, a gold star
for being a bad shot?

00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:50,488
(sighs)

00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:51,489
Porter knew I lied.

00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,525
He wanted 50 grand
to keep his mouth shut.

00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:55,794
And I was gonna pay him.

00:39:55,861 --> 00:39:57,963
I went to the bank
to get the money, but

00:39:58,029 --> 00:39:59,397
<i>somebody drained the account.</i>

00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:01,833
There was a million dollars
in that account last week.

00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,868
Who authorized the transfer?

00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:04,336
Jack Oakley.

00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,405
I went there to kill my father.

00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:09,507
<i>I knew he was going</i>
<i>to meet Heather,</i>

00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:12,210
<i>but for some reason,</i>
<i>she didn't show.</i>

00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:15,013
<i>And Porter got up the courage</i>
<i>to ask my dad for the money.</i>

00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,016
<i>He'd seen my father</i>
<i>with Heather.</i>

00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,117
You sick bastard!

00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:21,253
You got 24 hours,
then I turn you in!

00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,090
(gunshot)

00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:35,767
<i>The Marquis de Sade's</i>
<i>got nothing on my old man.</i>

00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:38,603
<i>Inflicting pain</i>
<i>is his idea of foreplay.</i>

00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,306
You're your mother's son,
not mine.

00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:47,412
Do you know how
much money he spent
abusing women?

00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:50,382
He didn't leave anything
for my mother and me

00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,285
except for more abuse.

00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:57,689
It had to stop.

00:40:57,756 --> 00:40:59,090
Where is he?

00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:01,693
His phone's off; every time
his phone's off, he's with her.

00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,861
Is he at the saloon?

00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:04,796
No, he wouldn't do that,
not after Porter.

00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:07,432
He's got to be
at Heather's.

00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:11,269
(siren wails in distance)

00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:15,173
BRASS:
So your sick fantasy
was to kill her.

00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,776
I didn't do anything.

00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,311
She solicited me.

00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:20,979
Strictly a business deal.

00:41:21,046 --> 00:41:23,281
She needed the money.

00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:27,118
I paid her close to $1 million
for this, you know that?

00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:29,921
That's about all
I'm gonna say.

00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,891
I'll be talking
with my lawyer.

00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,195
Too bad you spent the million.

00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:39,865
You could use it
on your defense.

00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:44,836
Look, Heather,
for what it's worth,

00:41:44,903 --> 00:41:46,838
I think you're
in the clear.

00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:48,974
The D.A.'s not gonna
press charges.

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,809
Attempted murder,
assisted suicide,

00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:54,412
the lines
are kind of blurred.

00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:56,181
But do yourself a favor.

00:41:56,248 --> 00:41:58,483
Get some help.

00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:04,623
(siren blips)

00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:07,392
(indistinct radio
communication)

00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:16,902
(knocking)

00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:25,443
Leave me alone.

00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:28,346
I didn't ask you to save me.

00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:31,416
I know.

00:42:31,483 --> 00:42:33,585
What am I supposed to do?
I'm your friend.

00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:39,524
Besides, there's someone
I want you to meet.
