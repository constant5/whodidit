<i>...the legendary organized</i>

00:00:14,012 --> 00:00:15,814

I love America!

00:00:20,018 --> 00:00:22,687
<i>...and partied on its disco</i>

00:00:24,222 --> 00:00:27,526
<i>Until August 1976,</i>
<i>when federal authorities</i>

00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:30,929
<i>linked Dunn to the murder</i>
<i>of a low-level mob informant.</i>

00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:33,298
<i>It was the case prosecutors</i>

00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:34,633
<i>The arrest warrant was issued,</i>

00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:36,134

has been loosened.

00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,774
Well, maybe it broke
on impact.

00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:11,042
Impact was from
the left side.

00:05:11,109 --> 00:05:13,545
But the bolts were loosened
on both sides.

00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:18,917

Sure was the life

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,954
Hmm. And the victim?

00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:04,423
Kenny-- a regular.
He'd come in for Karaoke night.

00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,928

Sometimes.

00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,166
You think it could've been
a hate crime?

00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,770
It's a karaoke bar.
I don't see a lot of hate here.

00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,038
Me neither.

Well's Head Lager.

00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,983
You sell much of that?

00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,219
I'm lucky if I move

00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,620

Mm-hmm.

00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,625
Empties should give us DNA

00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:40,926
Not that we really need them.

00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,662

00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,630

00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:45,965

00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:46,966

00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:47,967

pesticides, heavy metal...

00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,206
maybe some decomp.

Little piece of Vegas

00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:35,448

chapter about Mickey Dunn.

00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:37,350
What, that he was a
thrill in the sack?

00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,751
No... no, that was
Tony Constantine.

00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,720
Apparently, Mickey wanted
to go down

00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:41,887

00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,423

00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,192
Quite the ego on that guy.

00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:48,260
Even in death, he was
larger than life.

00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,930
Well, sure,
but all the original

criminals, either.

00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:46,179
Is that right?

00:22:46,246 --> 00:22:48,114
We know you worked
for Mickey Dunn.

00:22:48,181 --> 00:22:49,616
We know you chased him,

00:22:49,682 --> 00:22:52,819
<i>you ran him off the road,</i>
<i>you stuck a gun in his face.</i>

00:22:52,886 --> 00:22:55,855
<i>That's armed robbery.</i>

00:22:55,922 --> 00:22:57,991
If it happened.

00:22:58,057 --> 00:23:00,360
Johnny D'Angelo said it did.

00:23:00,426 --> 00:23:02,795
How is old scaredy-cat?

00:23:02,862 --> 00:23:04,464
Credible.

00:23:04,531 --> 00:23:06,900
There were a lot of
rumors going around.

00:23:06,966 --> 00:23:08,668
Mickey owned this,
he owned that.

00:23:08,735 --> 00:23:10,803
He owned a piece
of the D.I.

00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,972
We just happened
to work there.

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,841
A lot of us guys did.

00:23:14,908 --> 00:23:17,911
See, I'm thinking
that's not the full story.

00:23:17,977 --> 00:23:21,614
You're young; you don't know.

00:23:21,681 --> 00:23:24,617
The memories,
you get up there, they...

00:23:24,684 --> 00:23:26,186
they start getting tricky.

00:23:26,252 --> 00:23:29,055
Well, why don't you tell me
what you do remember.

00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:32,225
We took a little joyride,

00:23:32,292 --> 00:23:34,561
<i>looking for Mickey Dunn.</i>

00:23:34,627 --> 00:23:38,198
<i>But we never found him--</i>
<i>because someone else</i>

00:23:38,264 --> 00:23:41,534
<i>found him first,</i>
<i>and who that was, I don't</i>
<i>know.</i>

00:23:41,601 --> 00:23:44,170
<i>Because, by the time</i>
<i>we got there,</i>

00:23:44,237 --> 00:23:46,339
<i>whoever had killed Mickey Dunn</i>

00:23:46,406 --> 00:23:48,174
was already gone.

00:23:48,241 --> 00:23:51,010
Whoosh. Like a ghost.

00:23:51,077 --> 00:23:53,079
I don't believe in ghosts.

00:23:53,146 --> 00:23:55,348
But we got
one scared guy,

00:23:55,415 --> 00:23:58,952
we got two dead guys,
and we got you, Derek.

00:24:00,954 --> 00:24:03,523
How do you feel about your
buddies getting bumped off?

00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,226
I'm all torn up inside.

00:24:09,629 --> 00:24:11,564
You ever seen them?

00:24:11,631 --> 00:24:13,566
DEREK:
Never.

00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:17,170
But... they look like suspects.

00:24:17,237 --> 00:24:19,205
And I think you're fishing.

00:24:19,272 --> 00:24:23,076
And you got no legal
right to hold me.

00:24:24,677 --> 00:24:27,447
If you can't hold me...

00:24:27,514 --> 00:24:30,617
you got to let me go.

00:24:32,318 --> 00:24:33,653
(gun cocks)

00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,755
(gunshot echoing)

00:24:52,472 --> 00:24:54,073
Johnny?

00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,808
Johnny D'Angelo?

00:24:58,678 --> 00:25:01,748
(Iris sobbing)

00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,652
(doorjamb cracks,
alarm blares)

00:25:10,853 --> 00:25:13,923
Johnny D'Angelo!
Las Vegas PD!

00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,041
(sighs)

00:25:37,046 --> 00:25:38,981
Yeah, go for Brass.

00:25:39,048 --> 00:25:40,516
CURTIS:
Scene is Code 4.

00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,819
Johnny D'Angelo is not
at his house.

00:25:42,885 --> 00:25:45,388
BRASS:
Okay, got it. Thank you.

00:25:45,455 --> 00:25:47,356

Sweet ride.

00:26:54,924 --> 00:26:58,361

00:26:58,428 --> 00:26:59,762
Love?

00:26:59,829 --> 00:27:00,997
Tetracycline.

00:27:06,002 --> 00:27:09,472
You want to help me
with a little experiment?

00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:11,607
Sure.

00:27:15,978 --> 00:27:18,981
Grab that evidence bag?

00:27:21,484 --> 00:27:23,419
Okay, let me see that.

00:27:23,486 --> 00:27:25,488
Take this.

00:27:29,726 --> 00:27:33,129
No go. Okay.

00:27:38,434 --> 00:27:41,304
Looks like a match to me.

00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,939
This is your experiment?

00:27:43,005 --> 00:27:44,374
Actually, it is.

00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,508
Thanks.

00:27:45,575 --> 00:27:47,944
GRISSOM:
The victims-- Ken Billings,

00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:51,013
Mason Carter, Derek Paul
and Johnny D'Angelo--

00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,882
all murdered
in the last 24 hours.

00:27:52,949 --> 00:27:55,618
Four victims, three killers,
no connection between them.

00:27:55,685 --> 00:27:58,721
Johnny D'Angelo's on both lists.
BROWN:
Could be

00:27:58,788 --> 00:28:00,056
he hired the others.

00:28:00,123 --> 00:28:01,958
Could be.
We don't know <i>where</i> they are.

00:28:02,024 --> 00:28:03,826
We don't know <i>who</i> they are.
Let's stick

00:28:03,893 --> 00:28:06,496
to what we do know-- all the
victims worked for Mickey Dunn,

00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:09,065
who's been dead for 30 years.

00:28:09,132 --> 00:28:10,566
Well, check this out.

00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:13,002
I've been digging through
the police files all morning,

00:28:13,069 --> 00:28:14,537
and guess who I found.

00:28:14,604 --> 00:28:17,473
Officer Eddie Sanchez.

00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,542
The "Ghost Rider."

00:28:19,609 --> 00:28:22,045
Now, assuming he's
alive, the officer
would be 55 today.

00:28:22,111 --> 00:28:25,148
And he has family
down in Mexico.

00:28:25,214 --> 00:28:27,316
So you're thinking bike cop
shoots Mickey Dunn,

00:28:27,383 --> 00:28:28,584
dumps the car and

00:28:28,651 --> 00:28:29,752
takes the money?

00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:31,354
SANDERS:
And with the exchange rate,

00:28:31,421 --> 00:28:34,690
lives like a king, south of the
border, for the last 30 years.

00:28:34,757 --> 00:28:36,926
Fast-forward-- Mickey Dunn's car
gets discovered.

00:28:36,993 --> 00:28:39,362
SIDLE:
By a Mexican fisherman
who would be

00:28:39,429 --> 00:28:41,497
just about the same age
as the bike cop.

00:28:41,564 --> 00:28:43,266
Only the discovery
was bogus.

00:28:43,332 --> 00:28:44,634
Turns out the hood ornament

00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,502
pulled from Lake Mead
is a fake.

00:28:46,569 --> 00:28:50,406
So... the fisherman was
what, pulling off a hoax?

00:28:50,473 --> 00:28:53,409
GRISSOM:
That or fraud-- he either
planted that derringer

00:28:53,476 --> 00:28:57,647
at the crime scene,
or maybe someone paid him to.

00:28:57,714 --> 00:29:00,583
BROWN:
Either way, whoever did it knew
that this car was down there.

00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,251
SANDERS:
And was missing
the original hood ornament.

00:29:02,318 --> 00:29:04,554
SIDLE:
Who could know that?

00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,857
Someone who was there
the night it went down.

00:29:07,924 --> 00:29:09,525
SANDERS:
The motorcycle cop's

00:29:09,592 --> 00:29:10,960
looking better
every minute.

00:29:11,027 --> 00:29:12,361
Hey, don't rule out

00:29:12,428 --> 00:29:14,363
the ghost of Mickey Dunn.

00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:17,333

lividity's fixed:
dead two days.

00:29:22,004 --> 00:29:24,941
Before the Cadillac
was found.
Yeah.

00:29:25,007 --> 00:29:27,243
Ah, and I got
trace analysis

00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,979

collected on Chicken Johnny.

00:29:30,046 --> 00:29:32,882
And?
Alginate and
plaster of Paris.

00:29:32,949 --> 00:29:36,219
Combination used to
make dental impressions.

00:29:36,285 --> 00:29:39,822
And you don't even seem to be
the teeniest bit surprised.

00:29:39,889 --> 00:29:41,691
I'm not.

00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:03,706
Yeah, and look

All I know is the master
of all scary movies

00:31:15,118 --> 00:31:16,419
was Lon Chaney, Sr.,

00:31:16,486 --> 00:31:20,022
the man of
a thousand faces,

00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:22,425

and still he walks.

00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:36,613
All the evidence says
he was wearing

00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,614
state-of-the-art
prosthetics.

00:31:37,681 --> 00:31:38,615

his driver's license,

00:33:48,011 --> 00:33:51,448
<i>That drug incorporated</i>
<i>into his bones,</i>

00:33:51,515 --> 00:33:53,684
<i>making them glow</i>
<i>under ultraviolet light.</i>

00:33:55,252 --> 00:33:56,954
Helped us identify him.

00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,557
BRASS:
Thing's aren't looking
too good for you, Mickey.

00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:02,893
So now we know we got
a dead cop's body

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,328
in your old car.

00:34:04,394 --> 00:34:06,730
So tell me
what happened.

00:34:06,797 --> 00:34:08,632
You were skipping town

00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:09,900
and Eddie Sanchez
pulled you over

00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:11,235
and you shot him point-blank?

00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:15,839
Like I told you,
you missed a spot.

00:34:15,906 --> 00:34:17,474
You missed a big spot.

00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:20,744
I shot a lot of guys
point-blank.

00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:24,081
But this nosy piece
of garbage

00:34:24,148 --> 00:34:26,617
bike cop that

00:34:26,683 --> 00:34:29,853
you two are so teared-up
about...

00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,122
I shot him from 40 feet away

00:34:32,189 --> 00:34:35,292
with a soaking-wet
revolver.

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,262
It was one hell of a shot.

00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:50,007
<i>The poor dumb bastard</i>
<i>didn't know what hit him.</i>

00:34:50,073 --> 00:34:51,575
<i>He thought he'd been trained.</i>

00:34:51,642 --> 00:34:53,310
<i>They don't prepare you</i>
<i>for what I got.</i>

00:34:58,816 --> 00:35:00,684
SANCHEZ:
Stop!

00:35:00,751 --> 00:35:01,952
Stop or I'll shoot!

00:35:04,154 --> 00:35:05,489
I said stop!

00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:13,764
<i>You found the skull</i>
<i>had no teeth</i>

00:35:13,831 --> 00:35:17,301
<i>because I bashed 'em in</i>
<i>with the barrel of my gun.</i>

00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:20,304
And all the forensics
in the world

00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:24,252
ain't gonna show you that
when I smashed his face in...

00:35:26,977 --> 00:35:28,712
I liked it.

00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:33,250
You're under arrest, Mickey,
for murder.

00:35:34,918 --> 00:35:38,088
Thank God you blew me off
when I didn't know better.

00:35:39,189 --> 00:35:41,158
Sam Braun's daughter.

00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:47,631
You think that I would ever
forget a face?

00:35:47,698 --> 00:35:49,733
<i>That face?</i>

00:35:54,371 --> 00:35:57,674
Meet me outside,
2:00 a.m. sharp.

00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:06,884
Ask yourself
what force on earth

00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:11,722
that kept me from your soft
teenage graces.

00:36:11,789 --> 00:36:13,357
Only one:

00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:18,162
Daddy.

00:36:18,228 --> 00:36:19,363
Sam Braun stopped you?

00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:21,098
Sam always said

00:36:21,165 --> 00:36:26,470
if I ever touched you,
he'd tear me apart.

00:36:26,537 --> 00:36:28,705
That took a big pair
to say that to me.

00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:32,209
He said that
you were family.

00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:33,977
Still, now he's gone.

00:36:34,044 --> 00:36:36,346
We're here.

00:36:36,413 --> 00:36:38,048
We could always give it a go.

00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:41,718
You're not going anywhere.

00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:43,320
(gasping)

00:36:45,088 --> 00:36:46,657
(grunting)

00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:49,893
He's having a heart attack.

00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,362
Call a paramedic.

00:36:52,429 --> 00:36:55,632
Bum ticker... right on time.

00:36:55,699 --> 00:36:56,867
I'm dying.

00:36:56,934 --> 00:36:59,002
Okay, take it
easy, buddy.

00:36:59,069 --> 00:37:00,137
Take it easy.

00:37:12,449 --> 00:37:14,284
WILLOWS:
I'll give you a hint:

00:37:14,351 --> 00:37:15,986
you're not in Heaven.

00:37:17,554 --> 00:37:20,491
How long you been
living with a bullet
in your chest?

00:37:20,557 --> 00:37:22,693
Who told you?

00:37:22,759 --> 00:37:25,095
Why God invented X rays.

00:37:25,162 --> 00:37:28,132
You'd like
to take it out,

00:37:28,198 --> 00:37:31,301
have a closer look.

00:37:31,368 --> 00:37:35,239
Ah, but you can't do that,
not without killing me.

00:37:35,305 --> 00:37:38,509
I'm guessing it's a .38...

00:37:41,311 --> 00:37:42,613
<i>...which matches the .38</i>

00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,681
<i>that we took from the body</i>
<i>of Derek Paul,</i>

00:37:44,748 --> 00:37:47,885
<i>which also matches the one</i>
<i>that killed Eddie Sanchez.</i>

00:37:54,825 --> 00:37:57,461
You like horror movies, Mickey?

00:37:57,528 --> 00:38:00,430
You know... I love 'em.

00:38:00,497 --> 00:38:01,999
I got one for you.

00:38:02,065 --> 00:38:04,501
Does it got a monster in it?

00:38:04,568 --> 00:38:06,503
(chuckles)
Yeah.

00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,539
<i>I bet you heard it.</i>

00:38:08,605 --> 00:38:11,375
<i>It's strictly B-list stuff.</i>

00:38:11,441 --> 00:38:14,678
<i>No-name cast, summer release.</i>

00:38:14,745 --> 00:38:18,015
<i>Four Vegas punks run a monster</i>
<i>off the road.</i>

00:38:18,081 --> 00:38:21,251
<i>They shoot him, they rob him,</i>
<i>they leave him for dead.</i>

00:38:26,924 --> 00:38:29,359
<i>But everybody knows</i>
<i>that shooting the monster</i>

00:38:29,426 --> 00:38:30,928
<i>and killing him</i>
<i>are never the same.</i>

00:38:44,508 --> 00:38:46,810
<i>A young honest cop arrives</i>

00:38:46,877 --> 00:38:49,813
<i>and with him</i>
<i>comes opportunity.</i>

00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,253
<i>The monster changes his name,</i>
<i>his face...</i>

00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:04,561
<i>...passes for human.</i>

00:39:04,628 --> 00:39:08,165
<i>Rides off into the night.</i>

00:39:10,801 --> 00:39:14,671
And the legend is born.

00:39:14,738 --> 00:39:15,906
The end.

00:39:15,973 --> 00:39:17,107
Mickey,

00:39:17,174 --> 00:39:19,877
you know that real horror
stories never end.

00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:23,680
Oh, this one does.

00:39:23,747 --> 00:39:25,382
(laughs)

00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:28,619
It's been huge fun

00:39:28,685 --> 00:39:31,622
coming back, trying new faces,

00:39:31,688 --> 00:39:35,759
leading you
all around town
by the nostrils.

00:39:35,826 --> 00:39:38,295
Setting up the big discovery.

00:39:38,362 --> 00:39:40,998
Everybody, he know
Mickey Dunn.

00:39:41,064 --> 00:39:46,270
<i>I'm Sally Jeffers, KRAC-TV,</i>
<i>Lake Mead, Nevada.</i>

00:39:46,336 --> 00:39:49,139
MICKEY:
<i>Going after Kenneth...</i>

00:39:49,206 --> 00:39:51,375
I'm Mickey Dunn.

00:39:52,643 --> 00:39:55,379
(wheelchair crashes
as tires squeal)

00:39:58,348 --> 00:40:00,317
<i>...taking out Mason...</i>

00:40:04,054 --> 00:40:11,195
<i>...and the best part of all,</i>
<i>the look on poor Johnny's</i>
<i>face.</i>

00:40:11,261 --> 00:40:14,498
<i>Not the most handsome guy</i>
<i>in the world,</i>

00:40:14,565 --> 00:40:16,467
but a face worth wearing.

00:40:16,533 --> 00:40:21,605
And the hardest part--

00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:23,774
learning Spanish.

00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:26,276
(chuckles)

00:40:26,343 --> 00:40:27,811
Good times.

00:40:27,878 --> 00:40:30,380
Why now?

00:40:30,447 --> 00:40:32,382
Because that tiny
piece of metal

00:40:32,449 --> 00:40:35,552
that Derek shot in my chest
has finally moved.

00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:41,692
Doctors gave me a week,
maybe two, to live.

00:40:41,758 --> 00:40:43,460
Figured I'd go out
with a bang,

00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:45,863
never see the inside
of a cell.

00:40:45,929 --> 00:40:48,999
It's really funny how

00:40:49,066 --> 00:40:54,271
one little bullet can make
things suddenly seem so clear.

00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:01,578
You mean this bullet?

00:41:03,847 --> 00:41:05,382
Mob doctors

00:41:05,449 --> 00:41:10,921
become Mob doctors because they
sucked in the first place.

00:41:10,988 --> 00:41:12,856
But we got a licensed surgeon

00:41:12,923 --> 00:41:15,058
that fixed you up good.

00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:16,760
Cheer up, Mickey,
you're gonna live

00:41:16,827 --> 00:41:19,963
another 20... 30 years.

00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:24,868
And you'll be spending every day
in the federal penitentiary.

00:41:24,935 --> 00:41:28,205
But only until you die.

00:41:31,608 --> 00:41:34,411
Well, I'll still
go out a legend.

00:41:34,478 --> 00:41:36,914
You haven't changed that.

00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,917
Oh, you've been out of the game
awhile.

00:41:39,983 --> 00:41:43,520
The homies they have in the pen
these days never heard of you.

00:41:43,587 --> 00:41:46,790
That's impossible.

00:41:46,857 --> 00:41:50,794
No, Mickey, that's life.

00:41:50,861 --> 00:41:53,397
♪ That's life... ♪

00:41:53,464 --> 00:41:54,932
♪ <i>That's life...</i> ♪
