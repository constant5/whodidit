00:00:27,774 --> 00:00:29,709
The vic is
Ross Neddy. Ex-con.

00:00:29,776 --> 00:00:30,877
Spent a couple years

00:00:30,944 --> 00:00:32,546
in Jean for
domestic assault.

00:00:32,612 --> 00:00:33,914
Just got paroled.

00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,784
Shop foreman says he's only been
working here a few days.

00:00:37,851 --> 00:00:40,087
Out of the frying pan
into the fire.

00:00:40,153 --> 00:00:41,455
He is a crispy critter.

00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:44,624
I'd say the point
of origin was him.

00:00:44,691 --> 00:00:46,827
KEPPLER:
He should have stayed in prison.

00:00:46,893 --> 00:00:48,829
STOKES:
Mmm-hmm.

00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,698
KEPPLER:
Sloppy shop.

00:00:51,765 --> 00:00:53,867
This whole place is
a fire hazard.

00:00:53,934 --> 00:00:56,470
Okay if I move him out?

00:00:56,536 --> 00:00:58,505
STOKES:
Yeah, he's all yours,
Super Dave.

00:00:58,572 --> 00:01:01,408
(device beeping)

00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:03,643
There was a lot
of gasoline over here.

00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,046
Which explains this V-pattern.

00:01:06,113 --> 00:01:08,648
Accelerant,
a second point of origin.

00:01:08,715 --> 00:01:10,117
Most likely arson.

00:01:10,183 --> 00:01:11,585
Ex-con.

00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:13,253

<i>Enemies on the outside...</i>

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,888

What do you
think, Keppler?

00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,795
I think I'd better
head back to the body.

00:01:21,862 --> 00:01:24,564

00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:27,067

00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:28,668

Something ironic, I'm sure.

00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,656

a staple gun to him.

00:01:57,664 --> 00:01:59,966

00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:36,369

PVC piping is sometimes
used to replace bones

00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:13,602
that have been donated
for transplants.

00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:15,838
So that the body looks right

00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,740
ROBBINS:
Right.

00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:19,808

00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,411
KEPPLER:
Wait a minute,
they killed the guy

00:03:22,478 --> 00:03:24,246
and torched him;
there's no open casket.

00:03:24,313 --> 00:03:26,315
What's the point
of stuffing the body?

00:03:26,382 --> 00:03:27,249
Looks like the long bones
are gone...

00:03:27,316 --> 00:03:29,585
ditto for the spine...

00:03:29,652 --> 00:03:31,253
tendons
and cartilage...

00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,422
most major veins... phew.

00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:35,858
They took the heart valves, too.

00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:40,295
KEPPLER:
So somebody murders an ex-con,

00:03:40,362 --> 00:03:42,531
then commits arson to make it
look like an accident

00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:44,500
just so that they can harvest
his bones and tissues?

00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:46,468
That's big business--
disc replacement,

00:03:46,535 --> 00:03:47,469
joint replacement,

00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:50,172
bypasses, more
demand than supply.

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,141
Why leave the kidneys,

00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:53,876
the heart
and the liver?

00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,210
They're worth big money, too.

00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,846
Organ donation
is heavily regulated.

00:03:57,913 --> 00:03:59,315
Bone and tissue aren't.

00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:00,983
C.O.D.?
ROBBINS:
At this point,

00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,051
indeterminate.

00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,353
All I can say right
now is based on the
level of decomp,

00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,488
he's been dead at least a week.

00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:09,792
You think I'm
selling body parts?

00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:10,893
Come on, you're
wasting your time.

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,061
I sell refurbished engines.

00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,029
I don't know jack
about body parts.

00:04:14,096 --> 00:04:16,365
No one's looking for
a down-and-out ex-con.

00:04:16,432 --> 00:04:18,367
It's less risky than drugs.

00:04:18,434 --> 00:04:20,336
BOONY:
I hired Ross to weld
metal together.

00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:23,005
Even if I killed him--
not saying I did--

00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:25,474
but if even if I did, I'd
just burn the body as is,

00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,475
not re-pipe the guy.

00:04:26,542 --> 00:04:28,677
And I definitely
wouldn't burn him at work.

00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:30,312
Fire station's a block away.

00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:31,647
How do you know Ross?

00:04:31,714 --> 00:04:33,015
You meet him in the joint?

00:04:33,082 --> 00:04:35,317
I was out before he even
went in. I picked Ross up

00:04:35,384 --> 00:04:36,719
with a bunch of other
guys looking for work

00:04:36,785 --> 00:04:38,187
outside that big
hardware store

00:04:38,253 --> 00:04:40,556
on Herrick four days ago.

00:04:40,622 --> 00:04:41,890
When was the last time
you saw him?

00:04:41,957 --> 00:04:44,226
Four days ago.
He'd been working nights.

00:04:44,293 --> 00:04:46,095
Really?

00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,163
'Cause the coroner said
he's been dead at least a week.

00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,532
You calling me a liar?

00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:53,135
I'd believe a dead guy
over an ex-con.

00:04:58,307 --> 00:05:01,010
Living large.
Mm.

00:05:01,076 --> 00:05:03,712
Place this big in
MacDonald Ranch--
what's the occupation?

00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:05,447
That's, uh,
Bill Norton.

00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,582
You know,
Dorton Homes.

00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:08,384
Biggest
homebuilder in town.

00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,219
He built mine.
Huh.

00:05:10,285 --> 00:05:12,254
Oh, uh...

00:05:12,321 --> 00:05:14,256
you'd better
throw on some booties.

00:05:18,327 --> 00:05:21,563
BRASS:
Margo Dorton, age 39.
Her husband said

00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,033
he returned from a business trip
and found her like this.

00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:25,567
No sign of a forced entry.

00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,070
My guys are gonna go talk

00:05:28,137 --> 00:05:30,205
to the neighbors, see what they
say about their relationship.

00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:31,607
What did he say?

00:05:31,674 --> 00:05:35,277
According to him,
it was a honeymoon every day.

00:05:37,613 --> 00:05:39,748
SIDLE:
Maybe...

00:05:39,815 --> 00:05:41,450
she was having a honeymoon
with someone else.

00:05:41,517 --> 00:05:42,918
That'll be good motive
for the husband.

00:05:42,985 --> 00:05:44,453
SIDLE:
There's a void here.

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,788
Maybe someone was
sitting on the couch,

00:05:45,854 --> 00:05:47,056
or someone
was sitting

00:05:47,122 --> 00:05:48,424
on the floor
in front of the couch.

00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:51,493
But then where's
the "someone else"?

00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,796
I mean, why kill her
and not the lover?

00:05:53,862 --> 00:05:57,666
BROWN:
<i>Maybe the husband was the one</i>
<i>having the honeymoon and the...</i>

00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,134
<i>the wife walks in.</i>

00:06:00,202 --> 00:06:02,671
He kills her,
tells his lover to beat it.

00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,506
I'd buy it.

00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,076
Unless the husband's
alibi checks out.

00:06:07,142 --> 00:06:09,912
Airport. I was coming
home from the airport.

00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:12,247
It's a business trip.
Caught an early flight

00:06:12,314 --> 00:06:13,749
to surprise Margo.

00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:15,484
I want your best
cops on this.

00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,354
I contributed a lot
to this community.
Absolutely.

00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,588

00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:23,325
Around 10:30.
10:30.

00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:25,260
And you
arrived here at...
Midnight.

00:06:25,327 --> 00:06:26,929
Well, it took you an hour and
a half at that time of night

00:06:26,996 --> 00:06:28,097
to get from McKaren to here?

00:06:28,163 --> 00:06:31,266
A half an hour waiting
for baggage check,

00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,702
(voice cracking):
and half an hour
to find my driver,

00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,437
and a half an hour

00:06:35,504 --> 00:06:38,974

Nice purse. Nice dress.

00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,950
Maybe safe to say
she went out last night.

00:06:48,017 --> 00:06:50,853

The ex-con
digs up a corpse,

scoops out a few
body parts to sell,

00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:41,263

He's Jewish.
So what?

Observant Jews don't

Mmm-hmm.

00:11:11,313 --> 00:11:13,315
(applause)

00:11:16,452 --> 00:11:17,453
Hello.

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,489
Have you seen this man?

00:11:22,358 --> 00:11:24,026
For our first pair,

00:11:24,093 --> 00:11:27,429
starting at
the low price of $50,

00:11:27,496 --> 00:11:30,265
Cotton Candy!

00:11:30,332 --> 00:11:33,135
Doesn't accept checks,
just cold, hard cash.

00:11:33,202 --> 00:11:34,970
(cheering, whistling)

00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,174
WARRICK:
Check out the pink wig.

00:11:42,478 --> 00:11:44,046
Bid!

00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:52,976
CANDY:
Come on, come on.

00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:54,344
Why you got
to take the wig?

00:11:54,411 --> 00:11:55,912
Wig's part of my act.

00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:57,647
Y'all are straight
stealing from me

00:11:57,714 --> 00:11:58,982
right now! Hello!

00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:00,116
I'm crying for you.

00:12:00,183 --> 00:12:01,117
Synthetic.

00:12:01,184 --> 00:12:03,019
Same color and texture
as the one

00:12:03,086 --> 00:12:04,654
that we collected
off the vic.

00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:06,857
Whoa, wh...
Hey, hey, hey!

00:12:06,923 --> 00:12:07,891
Look, look, look,
look, look.

00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,292
Look, we didn't
even have sex, okay?

00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:10,527
It was all touchy feely.

00:12:10,594 --> 00:12:11,561
Jerky treats.

00:12:11,628 --> 00:12:13,096
What are you
talking about?

00:12:13,163 --> 00:12:14,764
The guy I took into V.I.P.
right before panty auction.

00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:15,966
Look, man, all we did was touch.

00:12:16,032 --> 00:12:17,801
Why do you think
you're being arrested?

00:12:17,868 --> 00:12:19,503
Solicitation, right?

00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:21,171
No, actually.

00:12:21,238 --> 00:12:23,840
We found this hair on
this woman's dead body.

00:12:23,907 --> 00:12:25,942
Margo?

00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:27,377
She's dead?

00:12:27,444 --> 00:12:30,213
And you think I killed her?

00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,848
With or without the help
of her husband.

00:12:31,915 --> 00:12:32,949
No, no, no.

00:12:33,016 --> 00:12:34,985
Look, man, I never seen
dude in that picture.

00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:35,986
And Margo,
yeah, I'll admit,

00:12:36,052 --> 00:12:37,554
I slapped the ho
around last night,

00:12:37,621 --> 00:12:39,055
but I didn't kill her.

00:12:39,122 --> 00:12:40,290
You slapped her around?

00:12:40,357 --> 00:12:42,092
She's always hanging out
with my fiancé.

00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,095
I couldn't take it anymore,
so... yeah.

00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:47,564
Bitch!

00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:49,666
Get off of me!

00:12:50,801 --> 00:12:51,835
No!

00:12:51,902 --> 00:12:55,071
Why would Margo Dorton
be hanging out here

00:12:55,138 --> 00:12:56,473
with your fiancé?

00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,909
He works upstairs.

00:12:58,975 --> 00:13:00,210
Upstairs?

00:13:00,277 --> 00:13:01,912
Look, honey,
they don't call this

00:13:01,978 --> 00:13:04,047
the Over-Under for nothing,
all right?

00:13:04,114 --> 00:13:05,415
What's your fiancé's name?

00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:06,750
Jesse.

00:13:06,817 --> 00:13:07,984
WARRICK:
Take her downtown.

00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:09,186
We're going upstairs.

00:13:09,252 --> 00:13:10,320
Are you serious?

00:13:10,387 --> 00:13:11,521
I didn't do anything.

00:13:11,588 --> 00:13:12,789
(handcuffs clicking)

00:13:12,856 --> 00:13:13,857
Come on, man.

00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:34,644
♪ ♪

00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,352
Is this a restaurant?

00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:45,455
If it is,
I'm scared of the menu.

00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:48,124
The bus boy looks likes

00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:49,960
he's in charge of
stocking the champagne.

00:13:50,026 --> 00:13:51,361
I'm gonna have
a word with him.

00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:52,395
Okay.

00:13:52,462 --> 00:13:54,798
Would you like
a Meet Book

00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:56,299
or do you have a steady host?

00:13:56,366 --> 00:13:57,300
Uh, actually,

00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:58,635
it's my first time.

00:13:58,702 --> 00:14:00,804
What exactly goes on here?

00:14:00,871 --> 00:14:01,938
This is a host club,

00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:03,640
a place where men
entertain women.

00:14:03,707 --> 00:14:05,442
It's the first
of its kind in Las Vegas.

00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:06,443
They started in Japan.

00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,311
Take your pick.

00:14:08,378 --> 00:14:10,480
Hosts get paid
by the bottle.

00:14:10,547 --> 00:14:12,015
There's a two bottle
minimum.

00:14:12,082 --> 00:14:13,316
Bottles range from $50

00:14:13,383 --> 00:14:14,985
to $5,000.

00:14:15,051 --> 00:14:18,622
What's a $5,000 bottle
of champagne taste like?

00:14:18,688 --> 00:14:20,290
We only sell one brand
of champagne.

00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:22,459
It's the host
attached to the bottle

00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:24,060
that determines price.

00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:26,730
Everything is legal
in Clark County.

00:14:26,797 --> 00:14:29,232
Miss, we don't sell sex here.

00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:30,834
What <i>do</i> you sell?

00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:31,968
A relationship.

00:14:32,035 --> 00:14:33,303
Isn't that what most women want?

00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,071
I don't know.

00:14:35,138 --> 00:14:36,339
But I know what I want.

00:14:36,406 --> 00:14:38,675
I want Jesse.

00:14:38,742 --> 00:14:41,111
Who doesn't?

00:14:41,178 --> 00:14:43,180
Let me see if he's avail.

00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,300
Never seen the old guy before,
but the lady, a bunch.

00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:05,268
Last night, she got blasted on

00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:06,670
by one of the strippers
downstairs.

00:15:06,736 --> 00:15:08,305
Really?

00:15:09,873 --> 00:15:11,007
(retching)

00:15:11,074 --> 00:15:12,943
Are they doing what I think
they're doing?

00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:14,177
Hosts get paid by the bottle.

00:15:14,244 --> 00:15:15,312
So they drink more

00:15:15,378 --> 00:15:16,847
than their stomachs
can handle.

00:15:16,913 --> 00:15:17,914
Always see blood
in those toilets.

00:15:18,882 --> 00:15:21,117
Ah, just off work, huh?

00:15:21,184 --> 00:15:22,786
Just on, actually.

00:15:22,853 --> 00:15:23,787
Sara Sidle,

00:15:23,854 --> 00:15:24,988
Crime Lab.

00:15:25,055 --> 00:15:26,289
Oh.

00:15:26,356 --> 00:15:27,891
What can I do for you?

00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,727
Do you know this woman?

00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:33,497
Ah. Lady Dorton.

00:15:33,563 --> 00:15:35,632
Yeah, she's one of
my relationships.

00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,334
Could I ask you
a few questions about her?

00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,869
Okay.

00:15:38,935 --> 00:15:40,237
Um, I don't like to talk about

00:15:40,303 --> 00:15:42,005
my relationships
out here.

00:15:42,072 --> 00:15:44,141
Let's take it someplace
a little more intimate, yeah?

00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:46,776
Okay.

00:15:50,113 --> 00:15:54,117
STOKES:
The coffin had only been in
the ground for about a week.

00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:56,019
Dirt and sod were
pretty loose,

00:15:56,086 --> 00:15:59,156
so it was relatively easy
to take out and put back in.

00:15:59,222 --> 00:16:01,191
You guys sure do a lot
of exhumations here.

00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:02,425
As many as we have to.

00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,665
Nobody home.

00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:09,733
No surprise.

00:16:14,971 --> 00:16:16,339
(camera clicking)

00:16:16,406 --> 00:16:19,176
Look at this.

00:16:19,242 --> 00:16:21,945
Lapinsky may have been burned

00:16:22,012 --> 00:16:23,814
in this shirt,

00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,448
but I doubt he was buried in it.

00:16:25,515 --> 00:16:27,117
Dead men don't wear plaid.

00:16:27,184 --> 00:16:28,685
Wait a minute.

00:16:28,752 --> 00:16:30,654
Is this blood?

00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,593
(fabric ripping)
Ow!

00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,628
Dead men don't bleed.

00:16:38,695 --> 00:16:40,630
(camera clicking)

00:16:40,697 --> 00:16:42,899
How did you
meet Margo?

00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:45,535
Uh, she picked me
from the Meet Book.

00:16:45,602 --> 00:16:47,437
And then what?

00:16:47,504 --> 00:16:50,407
Uh, she wanted
what most women want.

00:16:50,474 --> 00:16:51,508
What's that?

00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:52,609
No, thank you.

00:16:54,644 --> 00:16:57,848
The dream.

00:16:57,914 --> 00:16:58,849
And that's you.

00:16:58,915 --> 00:17:00,450
50 G's

00:17:00,517 --> 00:17:02,419
I make a month
says I am.

00:17:02,486 --> 00:17:04,654
Who doesn't want to be
swept off their feet?

00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:05,822
I am not sure

00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:07,691
it's something
that I would pay for.

00:17:07,757 --> 00:17:09,125
Yeah, but you don't
want to spend

00:17:09,192 --> 00:17:10,660
your whole life
waiting for it either.

00:17:10,727 --> 00:17:13,430
Right here, right now, a woman
can have a relationship

00:17:13,497 --> 00:17:15,298
with a man who only
wants to please her--

00:17:15,365 --> 00:17:17,534
who can make her laugh,

00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:19,836
wipe away her tears,

00:17:19,903 --> 00:17:22,405
give her the confidence
to be herself.

00:17:22,472 --> 00:17:24,141
And how many
of these

00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:26,309
relationships do you have?

00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:29,946
I can handle about 25 at a time.

00:17:30,013 --> 00:17:32,883
Is a woman named Cotton Candy
one of them?

00:17:32,949 --> 00:17:34,985
Yeah.

00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:37,354
She's been financially
worshipping me for a while.

00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,455
Now, she says

00:17:38,522 --> 00:17:40,323
that she is your fiancée.

00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,559
That's good.

00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:44,561
Means I'm doing my job.

00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:48,532
She told me that she and Margo
had a scuffle.

00:17:48,598 --> 00:17:50,367
Yeah.

00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:53,136
Um... my relationships

00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:55,672
do get jealous sometimes,
especially when one has

00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:59,442
more money than the other
and can monopolize my time.

00:17:59,509 --> 00:18:01,645
Is that why you're here,
because of that little catfight?

00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:02,746
No.

00:18:02,813 --> 00:18:06,149
Um, Margo Dorton was...

00:18:06,216 --> 00:18:08,051
bludgeoned to death
with a bottle

00:18:08,118 --> 00:18:10,120
of champagne.

00:18:15,192 --> 00:18:17,093
Margo was... killed?

00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,662
Yeah.

00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:21,665
And you think Cotton Candy
killed Margo?

00:18:21,731 --> 00:18:23,200
What do you think?

00:18:23,266 --> 00:18:26,336
Um... I wouldn't know.

00:18:26,403 --> 00:18:29,840
Would you know if Margo
took you home the other night?

00:18:29,906 --> 00:18:32,175
I don't see my relationships
outside of here.

00:18:32,242 --> 00:18:36,313
If it does happen, it marks
the end of the relationship.

00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:39,015
I mean, by having sex with me,
a woman's reached her goal.

00:18:39,082 --> 00:18:40,517
There's nothing more
I can give her.

00:18:40,584 --> 00:18:42,252
Did Margo's husband
know about you?

00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:44,688
She told me she was divorced.

00:18:44,754 --> 00:18:48,091
Well, Jesse...

00:18:48,158 --> 00:18:50,093
I'm, uh, sorry for your loss.

00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:55,532
SIMS:
<i>I ran the blood from the coffin</i>

00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,767
through CODIS,
and I got a hit,

00:18:57,834 --> 00:18:59,202
but it's not Ross Neddy.

00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:00,570
So he's got
a partner.

00:19:00,637 --> 00:19:03,006
Well, DNA matches
a Heidi Sultz,

00:19:03,073 --> 00:19:05,041
who did time
for domestic assault

00:19:05,108 --> 00:19:07,410
and is currently
out on parole.

00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:08,778
That's funny.

00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:11,114
Ross Neddy did time for
domestic assault, too.

00:19:11,181 --> 00:19:14,684
Maybe they're
sparring partners.

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,555
This is Heidi's last known.

00:19:18,622 --> 00:19:20,223
According
to her P.O.,

00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,858
she's been trying
to straighten out.

00:19:21,925 --> 00:19:24,394
She's detoxed, got a job.

00:19:24,461 --> 00:19:26,596
She's dumped Ross Neddy.

00:19:26,663 --> 00:19:27,964
She may be taking
the right steps,

00:19:28,031 --> 00:19:29,399
but she definitely
hasn't cleaned up.

00:19:29,466 --> 00:19:30,400

00:19:30,467 --> 00:19:31,434
MITCHELL:
Las Vegas P.D.

00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:33,270
Heidi Sultz?

00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:34,471
What's going on?

00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:35,772
You're under arrest.
Why?

00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:36,573
Where's Ross?

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,441
I haven't seen
that dog in weeks.

00:19:38,508 --> 00:19:40,010
MITCHELL:
Anyone else living
here with you?

00:19:40,076 --> 00:19:42,279
Yeah, my baby and my new
boyfriend Charlie.

00:19:42,345 --> 00:19:43,446
Where are they?

00:19:43,513 --> 00:19:45,715
Out back, hanging out.

00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:48,218
CURTIS:
Put her in the car.

00:19:59,696 --> 00:20:00,630
Ross.

00:20:00,697 --> 00:20:03,233
Wake up, sugar.

00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,434
Hey, baby.

00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:06,536
My name's Charlie,
Charlie Keefer.

00:20:06,603 --> 00:20:08,538
Get on the wall.

00:20:08,605 --> 00:20:09,673
I got I.D.

00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:11,107
It's in my jeans.

00:20:15,412 --> 00:20:17,614
Where'd you get this,

00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:18,915
the dollar store?

00:20:18,982 --> 00:20:19,983
Have a seat, Ross.

00:20:22,752 --> 00:20:24,321
KEPPLER:
This is your third strike, pal.

00:20:24,387 --> 00:20:26,890
Right now you're looking
at a minimum of 25 years.

00:20:26,957 --> 00:20:29,125
You want to talk to us?

00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:30,660
We can make sure
it doesn't get any worse.

00:20:30,727 --> 00:20:31,661
What do you say?

00:20:31,728 --> 00:20:33,029
(fussing)

00:20:33,096 --> 00:20:34,030
Daddy will be right there,
sweetheart.

00:20:34,097 --> 00:20:36,900
It's ten more
for falsifying an ID.

00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:38,835
Fifteen for grave robbing.

00:20:38,902 --> 00:20:41,004
Arson, that's another ten.

00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:43,640
Desecrating a corpse, ten;
another 20

00:20:43,707 --> 00:20:44,641
for trafficking body parts.

00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,009
Body parts? No way.

00:20:46,076 --> 00:20:48,178
I thought those
cuts were from,

00:20:48,245 --> 00:20:49,346
like, an autopsy.

00:20:50,881 --> 00:20:53,650
So you admit
to digging up Roger Lapinsky?

00:20:53,717 --> 00:20:57,721
I've been out two months
and the best job I can get

00:20:57,787 --> 00:21:00,190
is five bucks an hour
welding engine parts together.

00:21:00,257 --> 00:21:02,726
They wouldn't even
let me flip burgers.

00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:04,227
Heidi just had the baby.

00:21:05,462 --> 00:21:06,897
It wasn't like
it was gonna hurt anyone.

00:21:07,964 --> 00:21:10,066
<i>We dug up someone my age,</i>

00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:11,601
<i>took him to work.</i>

00:21:11,668 --> 00:21:13,136
<i>made him look like me.</i>

00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:17,574
<i>And then we torched it.</i>

00:21:22,546 --> 00:21:25,148
All I was looking for
was a fresh start.

00:21:25,215 --> 00:21:27,417
Best way to make it happen
was to kill myself.

00:21:27,484 --> 00:21:29,653
Should've stuck with
the five bucks an hour.

00:21:31,284 --> 00:21:33,920
Whoever did this must
have been pretty angry.

00:21:33,986 --> 00:21:36,556
Let me guess, multiple BFT?

00:21:36,622 --> 00:21:37,724
You got it.

00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,126
Fractured skull, broken nose,
cheek bones.

00:21:40,193 --> 00:21:40,993
Take a look.

00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,063
Defensive wounds consistent
with a cylindrical object.

00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:47,400
Warrick found a bloody
champagne bottle at the scene.

00:21:47,467 --> 00:21:48,735
That'll do the trick.

00:21:48,801 --> 00:21:50,903
But the death blow
came in the neck area.

00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,674
Impacted her Adam's apple
with so much force,

00:21:54,741 --> 00:21:57,076
<i>it sent a reflex arch</i>
<i>to the vagus nerve,</i>

00:21:57,143 --> 00:21:59,412
<i>causing a stimulus</i>
<i>to the heart.</i>

00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:00,980
<i>Bradycardia set in,</i>

00:22:01,047 --> 00:22:02,582
<i>causing the heart to slow,</i>

00:22:02,648 --> 00:22:04,717
<i>and eventually to stop.</i>

00:22:04,784 --> 00:22:07,620
BRASS:
So where'd you go
after the fight with Margo?

00:22:07,687 --> 00:22:08,855
Back to the pole.

00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:10,189
You're a real
workaholic, huh?

00:22:10,256 --> 00:22:11,357
Look, man,

00:22:11,424 --> 00:22:14,193
the more I work,
the more I can be with Jesse.

00:22:15,962 --> 00:22:18,831
I know how hard it is
to wiggle your ass all night.

00:22:18,898 --> 00:22:21,300
Now, why would you
want to spend

00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:23,703
all your hard-earned money
on a guy

00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:26,739
whose job it is to be
with you and 24 other women?

00:22:26,806 --> 00:22:28,674
He doesn't care about them.

00:22:28,741 --> 00:22:29,942
Now you know this is
not a real relationship.

00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:32,078
It's a business transaction.

00:22:32,145 --> 00:22:34,414
He's doing the same
kind of thing that you

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,883
are doing
on the pole for the guys.

00:22:36,949 --> 00:22:40,686
Those guys, they can't see
past this, okay?

00:22:40,753 --> 00:22:44,791
I am more than a piece
of meat to Jesse.

00:22:44,857 --> 00:22:46,726
He-he-he doesn't judge me.

00:22:46,793 --> 00:22:49,762
All right?
He doesn't
blow me off.

00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:53,766
He makes me smile, you know?

00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:55,802
He heals me,
he heals me when I'm down.

00:22:55,868 --> 00:22:59,338
He makes me feel
like I am Mrs. Steve Wynn.

00:23:00,807 --> 00:23:02,442
Hmm.

00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:04,444
Now we're going to get married,
real soon.

00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,080
Can you show me some
verifiable proof

00:23:07,146 --> 00:23:09,348
of where you were
the night Margo was murdered?

00:23:09,415 --> 00:23:12,185
I was in V.I.P.
with this pit boss,

00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:13,920
Joe Brodsky--
works at the Olympia.

00:23:13,986 --> 00:23:17,290
But he's married and
he'll probably deny it.

00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:19,125
But I can prove it to you if you
give me my wallet right now.

00:23:19,192 --> 00:23:20,359
Sure. Okay, go ahead.

00:23:25,565 --> 00:23:27,300
There it is.

00:23:34,807 --> 00:23:37,977
Right there.
He paid me with those.

00:23:38,044 --> 00:23:40,847
Brand-new, straight
from the bank.

00:23:40,913 --> 00:23:42,815
And what would you like us
to do with those?

00:23:42,882 --> 00:23:45,585
You're a CSI.

00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:50,490
You can take a print off
of there, easy... duh.

00:24:05,938 --> 00:24:08,040
Hi.

00:24:08,107 --> 00:24:09,809
What are you doing?

00:24:09,876 --> 00:24:11,144
Just looking.

00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,946
What do you think?

00:24:14,013 --> 00:24:15,448
Meticulous.

00:24:15,515 --> 00:24:17,283
Obsessive.

00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,619
Clearly knows his way
around a modeling kit.

00:24:19,685 --> 00:24:22,388
Grissom didn't make those.

00:24:22,455 --> 00:24:25,725
No? Hmm.

00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:27,560

Bugs in bottles,
the Darwin desk set.

00:24:31,097 --> 00:24:35,168
He's a bit of a collector
of certain things.

00:24:35,234 --> 00:24:37,670
Yeah, I knew a guy in Philly
like that.

00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:39,338
Kept a case of thumbs
in his closet.

00:24:39,405 --> 00:24:40,840
Friend of yours?

00:24:40,907 --> 00:24:43,476
No, a serial killer.

00:24:46,412 --> 00:24:47,213

One is out in Summerlin.

00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:34,087
It's called Longevity

Check this out.

00:26:38,624 --> 00:26:40,426
Yeah. It's the Chinese character

00:26:40,493 --> 00:26:42,962
for "long life".

00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:45,164
So, what can Longevity do
for the L.V. Police?

00:26:45,231 --> 00:26:47,934
We need to know if your company
received tissue or bone

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,435
from a Roger Lapinsky.

00:26:49,502 --> 00:26:50,236
What's the problem?

00:26:50,303 --> 00:26:51,938
There might not be one.

00:26:52,004 --> 00:26:53,072
All right.

00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:55,374
Well, I'd be
happy to check.

00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:57,677
Will you excuse
me, sweetie?

00:27:01,147 --> 00:27:03,149
(computer keys tapping)

00:27:05,718 --> 00:27:07,820
Yep, there he is.

00:27:07,887 --> 00:27:10,623
Roger Lapinsky, 37 years old,

00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:13,126
died of cardiac arrest.

00:27:13,192 --> 00:27:14,660
It's tragic.

00:27:14,727 --> 00:27:16,162
We're going to need
a copy of his records,

00:27:16,229 --> 00:27:18,097
and we're going to need
to confiscate his parts.

00:27:18,164 --> 00:27:19,599
And if you don't tell me
what's going on,

00:27:19,665 --> 00:27:21,734
you're going to
need a warrant.

00:27:21,801 --> 00:27:23,436
This is a criminal
investigation.

00:27:23,503 --> 00:27:24,837
Those parts are evidence now.

00:27:29,342 --> 00:27:30,977
You know, I was always
under the impression

00:27:31,043 --> 00:27:34,213
that the body parts were to be
removed at the hospital.

00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,082
Major organs have
to be removed at the hospital

00:27:36,149 --> 00:27:37,216
and then transplanted

00:27:37,283 --> 00:27:40,453
into the new patients
within four to six hours,

00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,222
but bone and tissue
can be removed at any point

00:27:43,289 --> 00:27:44,457
and stored for up to five years.

00:27:44,524 --> 00:27:46,459
Who gives you access
to those parts?

00:27:46,526 --> 00:27:47,860
I always have signed consent
from next of kin.

00:27:47,927 --> 00:27:49,562
STOKES:
And?

00:27:49,629 --> 00:27:51,364
Most funeral homes have tissue
recovery coordinators.

00:27:51,431 --> 00:27:54,233
They choose who the parts go to.

00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,635
If you have a good reputation,

00:27:55,701 --> 00:27:57,970
you have a better chance
of getting the parts.

00:27:58,037 --> 00:27:59,906
I help the dead help the living.

00:27:59,972 --> 00:28:02,041
According to your records,

00:28:02,108 --> 00:28:05,478
Roger Lipinsky's body parts came
from the Silver Hills Mortuary.

00:28:05,545 --> 00:28:07,213
If that's what it says.

00:28:12,318 --> 00:28:13,786
Hey.

00:28:13,853 --> 00:28:15,988
So you heard Cotton Candy's
alibi checked out?

00:28:16,055 --> 00:28:17,156
Yeah.

00:28:17,223 --> 00:28:21,427

Mr. Dorton's limo driver.

he got home way past T.O.D.

00:28:24,163 --> 00:28:26,699
I don't get it, Warrick.

00:28:26,766 --> 00:28:28,000
The vic is in a good marriage,

00:28:28,067 --> 00:28:30,670
and she's spending thousands
on a "fake" boyfriend

00:28:30,737 --> 00:28:32,338
that she's not even
having sex with.

00:28:32,405 --> 00:28:34,107
It doesn't make any sense.

00:28:34,173 --> 00:28:38,211
Like this void on the sofa
for instance.

00:28:38,277 --> 00:28:41,914

of a third person,

00:28:41,981 --> 00:28:44,083
but we don't have
any evidence to back that up.

00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,285
Maybe it's not a person.

00:28:46,352 --> 00:28:49,222
Maybe it's a thing.

Rectangular, roughly,
what, 11 by 14 inches?

00:28:53,426 --> 00:28:55,395
It was obviously
important enough

00:28:55,461 --> 00:28:56,262
that the killer took it.

00:28:56,329 --> 00:28:58,498

but he was a drunk.

00:30:42,568 --> 00:30:44,670
Last we heard, the kid ran away.

00:30:44,737 --> 00:30:46,973
She was looking
at these photos

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,541
when she was killed.
Yeah.

00:30:48,608 --> 00:30:50,376
She started taking them out
ever since she hit menopause.

00:30:50,443 --> 00:30:52,845
BRASS:
Wasn't she
a little young

00:30:52,912 --> 00:30:53,746
for menopause?

00:30:53,813 --> 00:30:55,548
They call it premature menopause

00:30:55,615 --> 00:30:56,983
and she was having
a tough time with it.

00:30:57,049 --> 00:31:00,386
The mood swings,
the "brain fog,"

00:31:00,453 --> 00:31:02,221
the emotional detachment.

00:31:02,288 --> 00:31:04,390
The finality of not having
any more children.

00:31:04,457 --> 00:31:06,826
BRASS:
Bill...

00:31:06,893 --> 00:31:09,829
did you know that
Margo was frequenting

00:31:09,896 --> 00:31:11,898
um...a so-called
host club,

00:31:11,964 --> 00:31:14,000
and paying money
to a male escort?

00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:15,635
No. She was paying for sex?

00:31:15,701 --> 00:31:17,003
SIDLE:
She was paying...

00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,371
for companionship.

I'm looking for
Salvatore Heinz.

00:31:35,088 --> 00:31:36,255
You got him.

00:31:36,322 --> 00:31:37,557
Mike Keppler,
Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:31:37,623 --> 00:31:39,459
Sorry if I don't shake.

00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:41,527
I, uh, hope you don't mind
if I keep working here,

00:31:41,594 --> 00:31:42,662
I'm kind of on a deadline.

00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,798
That's mortuary humor.

00:31:45,865 --> 00:31:47,400
I'm sure it never gets old.

00:31:47,467 --> 00:31:50,703
We're following up
on a body that came
through here.

00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,004
Roger Lapinsky.

00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,374
You know, he does
look familiar.

00:31:55,441 --> 00:31:57,677
I believe he's spending
his eternal rest

00:31:57,744 --> 00:31:59,112
at Horizon Meadows Cemetery.

00:31:59,178 --> 00:32:00,646
Not anymore.
Someone dug him up.

00:32:00,713 --> 00:32:02,115
Aw, geez.

00:32:02,181 --> 00:32:03,983
You know, sometimes I wonder
what the heck is going on

00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,251
with the world these days.

00:32:05,318 --> 00:32:08,721
His major bones, veins
and tendons were all stolen.

00:32:08,788 --> 00:32:11,991
Recovered! Not stolen.

00:32:12,058 --> 00:32:14,394
I'm a certified tissue
recovery coordinator.

00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,828
Oh, yeah?

00:32:15,895 --> 00:32:19,232
That where you learned how to
stuff the bodies with umbrellas?

00:32:19,298 --> 00:32:22,769
That was a one-time thing.

00:32:22,835 --> 00:32:26,305
I ran out of
PVC pipe, and, uh...

00:32:26,372 --> 00:32:28,107
so I improvised.

00:32:28,174 --> 00:32:30,109
Understandable.
Look, it was a closed

00:32:30,176 --> 00:32:32,245
casket service, and uh...

00:32:32,311 --> 00:32:33,780
I have a signed consent form.

00:32:33,846 --> 00:32:35,948
Where? If you don't mind,
I'd like to take a look at that.

00:32:36,015 --> 00:32:37,817
Sure.

00:32:37,884 --> 00:32:40,453
Anything for LVPD.

00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:51,697
KEPPLER:
I take it you do a lot a work

00:32:51,764 --> 00:32:54,200
with, uh...
Longevity Tissue Services?

00:32:54,267 --> 00:32:56,769
Some.

00:32:56,836 --> 00:32:59,038
Those are just
promotional items.

00:32:59,105 --> 00:33:00,573
Handy in a pinch, huh?

00:33:03,409 --> 00:33:06,446

Lapinsky, Roger.

00:33:06,512 --> 00:33:08,281
It's all yours.

00:33:08,347 --> 00:33:10,016
I got copies.
Thanks.

00:33:15,221 --> 00:33:17,857
HEINZ:
C.O.D., cardiac arrest.

00:33:17,924 --> 00:33:20,059
Everything seems
to be in order here.

00:33:20,126 --> 00:33:21,627
Like I said.

00:33:21,694 --> 00:33:23,830
Thanks for
your time.

ROBBINS:

00:33:28,701 --> 00:33:30,536
Want a C.O.D.
on your Frankenstein?

00:33:30,603 --> 00:33:32,071
Beat you to it-- cardiac arrest.

00:33:32,138 --> 00:33:33,840
Not according to histology.

00:33:33,906 --> 00:33:35,842
Roger Lapinsky died of leukemia.

00:33:38,644 --> 00:33:40,680
You want to repeat that, Doc?
Sure.

00:33:40,747 --> 00:33:43,783
Roger Lapinksy died of leukemia.

00:33:44,817 --> 00:33:46,586
Thanks.

00:33:48,421 --> 00:33:49,956
If you don't mind, I'll, uh...

00:33:50,022 --> 00:33:52,358
stick around here
till the warrant comes.

00:33:54,882 --> 00:33:57,151
KEPPLER:
I got a copy of Roger Lapinsky's

00:33:57,217 --> 00:33:58,552
death certificate
from Carson City.

00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,487
KEPPLER:
This is the one we got
from the mortician,

00:34:00,554 --> 00:34:03,791
that old nut job, see?
Changed the C.O.D.

00:34:03,857 --> 00:34:05,659
It turns out, Ty Miloni...

00:34:05,726 --> 00:34:07,294
is a bit of a hustler as well.

00:34:07,361 --> 00:34:10,731
Those umbrellas were
a promotional gift

00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,099
for a vitamin

00:34:14,101 --> 00:34:15,302
This guy isn't even a doctor.

00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:17,404
He did drop out of
chiropractic school.

00:34:17,471 --> 00:34:18,939
You're telling me that
any Tom, Dick, or Harry

00:34:19,006 --> 00:34:21,308
with a sign can open up
a tissue bank?

00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:22,409
Well, if you're FDA
registered, yeah.

00:34:22,476 --> 00:34:23,811
How do you get FDA registered?

00:34:23,877 --> 00:34:24,979
You just fill out a form.

00:34:25,045 --> 00:34:27,348
In the last
three years,

00:34:27,414 --> 00:34:28,716
37 of the bone and tissue donors

00:34:28,782 --> 00:34:30,184
were from Silver Hills mortuary

00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,653
that went to this
Longevity clinic.

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,290
C.O.D in 23 of those
cases was cardiac arrest.

00:34:36,357 --> 00:34:39,093
And most of those decedents
were in their 30s and 40s.

00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,961
That's a lot of young
heart attacks.

00:34:41,028 --> 00:34:43,631
We're going to through
all these C.O.D's

00:34:43,697 --> 00:34:45,699
and match them up against the
official death certificates.

00:34:45,766 --> 00:34:47,234
And do more exhumations.

00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:51,038
The only thing
I'm wondering--

00:34:51,105 --> 00:34:53,374
is the mortician hustling
the tissue bank guy

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,009
or they're working together.

isn't it, Mr. Heinz?

00:36:04,144 --> 00:36:05,813
A man dies of leukemia,

00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:07,881
and his body comes
into your mortuary,

00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:09,249
and you decide to...

00:36:09,316 --> 00:36:12,553
sell his spare parts
for a few extra bucks.

00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:16,390
Only problem is, nobody wants
to buy diseased body parts,

00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:18,559
so you make a new
death certificate,

00:36:18,626 --> 00:36:20,594
change the C.O.D.,

00:36:20,661 --> 00:36:22,296
sign off with a legit
doctor's signature,

00:36:22,363 --> 00:36:24,465
and cash a check
from Ty Miloni.

00:36:24,531 --> 00:36:25,633

00:36:25,699 --> 00:36:27,401
He always seemed so honest.

00:36:27,468 --> 00:36:29,403
Have you ever followed up
on any of the patients

00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,604
who received parts

00:36:30,671 --> 00:36:32,106
from the Silver
Hills Mortuary?

00:36:32,172 --> 00:36:33,641
No. That's the hospital's job.
But as far as I know,

00:36:33,707 --> 00:36:35,142
none of the recipients
have ever complained.

00:36:35,209 --> 00:36:37,778
Maybe that's 'cause
they're not around anymore.

00:36:37,845 --> 00:36:40,147
We followed up on several
patients who received

00:36:40,214 --> 00:36:41,315
Silver Hills
bone and tissue

00:36:41,382 --> 00:36:43,284
from your clinic and now
seven of them are dead.

00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,818
Three from hepatitis,

00:36:44,885 --> 00:36:48,289
three from cancer,
and one AIDS-related.

00:36:48,355 --> 00:36:51,258
The same thing ironically
killed the donors.

00:36:51,325 --> 00:36:52,626
One of those victims
was a 15-year-old

00:36:52,693 --> 00:36:55,596
healthy high school
soccer player.

00:36:55,663 --> 00:36:57,431
You gave him
a contaminated kneecap.

00:36:57,498 --> 00:36:59,466
Oh, my God.

00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:00,934
He came to me!

00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:03,337
You harvested
diseased body parts

00:37:03,404 --> 00:37:05,172
and sold them
under false pretenses.

00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:07,174
He told me what to do.

00:37:07,241 --> 00:37:08,842
He... he said it was safe!

00:37:08,909 --> 00:37:11,512
But you didn't have to do it,
did you, Mr. Heinz?

00:37:11,578 --> 00:37:13,580
You took money,

00:37:13,647 --> 00:37:15,182
and people died.

00:37:15,249 --> 00:37:17,985
Now, whether or not
we got him--

00:37:18,052 --> 00:37:19,586
we got you.

00:37:19,653 --> 00:37:20,621
You've got nothing on me.

00:37:20,688 --> 00:37:21,622
I don't care what that...

00:37:21,689 --> 00:37:23,958
little body snatcher tells you.

00:37:24,024 --> 00:37:25,626
The families are going
to sue you

00:37:25,693 --> 00:37:27,094
and your company
into bankruptcy.

00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,395
They can try.

00:37:28,462 --> 00:37:30,197
That is what signed
release forms are for.

00:37:30,264 --> 00:37:33,634
You're reopening a very nasty,
old wound for them, now.

00:37:33,701 --> 00:37:35,269
Uh-uh. I didn't do anything.

00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,770
Because of you...

00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,973
they're going to have
to rebury their mother,

00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:40,908
their father, their son,
their daughter.

00:37:44,612 --> 00:37:46,280
Ty...

00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,681
let me tell
you something.

00:37:47,748 --> 00:37:50,851
I'm gonna come down
to that clinic...

00:37:51,885 --> 00:37:53,988
...and I'm going
to go through it

00:37:54,054 --> 00:37:56,223
piece by piece by piece.

00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,125
And if something
doesn't jibe,

00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,460
I can assure you...

00:37:59,526 --> 00:38:02,129
sir, I will find it.

00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,465
Well, that is your job,
isn't it?

00:38:04,531 --> 00:38:06,166
Yes, it is.

00:38:07,601 --> 00:38:08,836
And you'll have
my full cooperation.

<i>I did a little background</i>

00:38:13,907 --> 00:38:16,510
He was in and out of 11
different foster homes.

00:38:16,577 --> 00:38:18,479
Brass accessed
his juvie records.

00:38:18,545 --> 00:38:20,214
He had multiple arrests
for prostitution,

00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:22,316
and drug possession.

00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:25,152
Kid had a hard life if
he had to take it to the
streets to make a buck.

00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,688
We still need his DNA,
and if he did kill Margo,

00:38:27,755 --> 00:38:29,356
he's not just
gonna give it up.

00:38:29,423 --> 00:38:30,724
What about the vomit
that we found

00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:31,859
in the toilet at
the crime scene?

00:38:31,925 --> 00:38:33,160
What about it?

00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,162
Well, the hosts drink a
lot and throw up a lot.

00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:38,132
Busboy says he
always finds blood
in the toilets.

00:38:38,198 --> 00:38:41,135
If Jesse's a host,
chances are he's
throwing up blood, too.

00:38:42,136 --> 00:38:45,739
SIDLE:
Jesse, we found your DNA

00:38:45,806 --> 00:38:49,109
in Margo Dorton's toilet.

00:38:50,177 --> 00:38:51,545
I thought that you said
that you didn't

00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:53,414
see your relationships
outside of the club.

00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,383
Unless, of course,
the relationship is ending.

00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,919
BRASS:
Oh yeah, that's a
cold word for it--

00:38:58,986 --> 00:39:00,087
for murder.

00:39:00,154 --> 00:39:03,324
I didn't kill her, all right?

00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:06,393
I ended the relationship
and I bounced.

00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,062
Champagne got me sick.

00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:10,931
No, I don't think
it was the champagne, Jesse.

00:39:10,998 --> 00:39:13,801
I think it was Margo.

00:39:13,867 --> 00:39:16,370
She was coming to see you
for a couple of months,

00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,072
spending a
lot of money,

00:39:18,138 --> 00:39:20,841
you were running your
pro-game, you know,
doing the host thing.

00:39:20,908 --> 00:39:23,944
Holding her hand,
touching, consoling her.

00:39:24,011 --> 00:39:27,014
Laying on the
old Jesse magic.

00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:30,918
But then she laid
some pretty heavy
information on you.

00:39:30,985 --> 00:39:32,920
I want you to come home with me.

00:39:35,189 --> 00:39:37,825
So you want to end
the relationship?

00:39:37,891 --> 00:39:39,693
I guess you thought, you know...

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,728
here's Margo,

00:39:40,794 --> 00:39:42,796
this cougar...

00:39:42,863 --> 00:39:44,632
wants to take me
back to the love pit,

00:39:44,698 --> 00:39:46,567
end the relationship.

00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,236
Sexy time.

00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:52,206
But it didn't turn out
that way, did it?

00:39:55,843 --> 00:39:57,177
Jesse, I...

00:39:57,244 --> 00:39:58,846
Shh...

00:39:59,413 --> 00:40:00,347
Look, um...

00:40:00,414 --> 00:40:02,583
I have something
I need to show you.

00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,685
Okay?

00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,624
This is you.

00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,664
I'm your mother, Jesse.

00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,704
I've waited my entire life
to tell you this.

00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:24,838
I love you.

00:40:24,905 --> 00:40:26,707
I'm sorry.

00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,642
No!

00:40:37,551 --> 00:40:39,687
(retching)

00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:47,528
You look a little
pale, Jesse.

00:40:47,594 --> 00:40:50,564
Are you getting this?

00:40:50,631 --> 00:40:52,333
She lied to me.

00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:54,401
Said she hired

00:40:54,468 --> 00:40:56,971
some private investigator
to find me.

00:40:57,037 --> 00:41:00,975
Said she'd been
building up the nerve

00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,611
to tell me the truth.

00:41:03,677 --> 00:41:06,413
Said she had
a lot to make up for.

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,184
And that, uh...

00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,720
I could have her car.

00:41:12,786 --> 00:41:16,190
And that I didn't have
to work anymore.

00:41:16,256 --> 00:41:18,158
You thought those were lies?

00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:21,395
Yeah, lies to get
closer to me.

00:41:21,462 --> 00:41:24,732
All my clients
have their tactics.

00:41:24,798 --> 00:41:29,069
But hers was... insane.

00:41:29,136 --> 00:41:33,007
She wasn't lying to you, Jesse.

00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:36,877
You have 
13 alleles

00:41:36,944 --> 00:41:39,013
in common.

00:41:41,448 --> 00:41:42,716
You killed your mother.

00:41:44,918 --> 00:41:47,521
Then take me to jail.

00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:50,524
You know,
call me a killer...

00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:54,461
a murderer, whatever,

00:41:54,528 --> 00:41:56,297
but don't tell me

00:41:56,363 --> 00:42:01,268
I have a mother...
because I don't.

00:42:01,335 --> 00:42:02,770
I never did.

00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:06,674
And I never will.

00:42:42,743 --> 00:42:43,744
Hey.

00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,079
Need some help?

00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,580
Aren't you off shift?

00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,315
Yeah. Are you?

00:42:48,382 --> 00:42:50,451
Yeah.

00:42:50,517 --> 00:42:51,852
Thanks.

00:42:51,919 --> 00:42:53,287
I'll be back in a minute.

00:43:16,539 --> 00:43:17,470
Keppler?
