00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:09,286
(distorted, indistinct,
overlapping voices)

00:00:22,432 --> 00:00:25,002
WOMAN (distant):
<i>There's an Amber Alert</i>
<i>this evening in Clark County</i>

00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:26,937
<i>for two missing boys.</i>

00:00:27,004 --> 00:00:29,072
Okay, we have two
missing criticals--

00:00:29,139 --> 00:00:30,574
Jason Crowley, age ten--

00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:33,043
black, male, four-foot-six.

00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,046
Lucas Hanson--
age ten, Caucasian,

00:00:36,113 --> 00:00:38,415
male, five feet.
Now, uh,

00:00:38,482 --> 00:00:41,718
the boys were last seen at this
location at 15:30 hours--

00:00:41,785 --> 00:00:43,020
Jason Crowley's house.

00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:44,855
Jason lives with his
grandfather, Terrance Crowley.

00:00:44,922 --> 00:00:46,456
The address is on your handouts.

00:00:46,523 --> 00:00:48,358
Terrance Crowley
assumed

00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:49,860
that they were staying
at Lucas' house.

00:00:49,927 --> 00:00:52,429
Dawn Hanson,
Lucas's mother,

00:00:52,496 --> 00:00:54,831
returned home from work
at 21:00 hours.

00:00:54,898 --> 00:00:57,434
She assumed they were
at Terrance Crowley's house.

00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:59,703
She reported them
missing at 24:00 hours.

00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,839
Now, we searched the schools,
playgrounds, basketball courts.

00:01:02,906 --> 00:01:04,174
Found nothing.

00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:05,609
Canine is on the scene.

00:01:05,676 --> 00:01:07,978
Neither of the boys carried
cell phones or pagers.

00:01:08,045 --> 00:01:09,246
Now, any
questions?

00:01:09,313 --> 00:01:11,214
Boys ever run
away before?
No, and, uh,

00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:12,816
we interviewed the teachers
at the school,

00:01:12,883 --> 00:01:14,618
and according to them,
they're both good kids.

00:01:14,685 --> 00:01:15,786
(cell phone chimes)

00:01:15,852 --> 00:01:17,387
MAN:
Any, uh, distinguishing
features or marks?

00:01:17,454 --> 00:01:18,789
BRASS:
Well, as you can see,

00:01:18,855 --> 00:01:21,758
Jason wears glasses,
but that's it. Yeah?

00:01:21,825 --> 00:01:24,161
MAN 2:
Did Amber Alerts go
out to any other states?

00:01:24,227 --> 00:01:25,462
BRASS:
Amber Alerts
have gone out

00:01:25,529 --> 00:01:26,763
to the states of
Utah, California...

00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,199
(siren blaring)

00:01:31,635 --> 00:01:35,138
Okay, so what does your arson
have to do with my missing kids?

00:01:35,205 --> 00:01:36,974
Upon initial search
of the premises,

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,709
farmer located one adult male

00:01:38,775 --> 00:01:40,277
unconscious
on the living room floor.

00:01:40,344 --> 00:01:41,678
His name's Carl Fisher.

00:01:41,745 --> 00:01:43,347
Paramedics have him
on the bumper now.

00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:45,749
Once he came around,
he started claiming

00:01:45,816 --> 00:01:47,851
every time there's
an Amber Alert,

00:01:47,918 --> 00:01:49,419
somebody tries to kill him.

00:01:49,486 --> 00:01:51,154
Child molester.

00:01:51,221 --> 00:01:54,024
Tier Two,
by his own admission.

00:02:00,264 --> 00:02:01,999
Excuse me,

00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:03,667
Mr. Fisher?
My name's Gil Grissom.

00:02:03,734 --> 00:02:06,703
I'm with the Crime Lab.

00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,338
What happened
to your shoes?

00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:09,606
They're in the house.

00:02:09,673 --> 00:02:11,375
I was asleep.

00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:15,579
Are you familiar with the names
Lucas Hanson or Jason Crowley?

00:02:15,646 --> 00:02:17,614
The kids from the Amber Alert?

00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:18,849
No, sir.

00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,417
I'm a convicted pedophile.

00:02:20,484 --> 00:02:21,818
That would be a violation

00:02:21,885 --> 00:02:23,887
of my parole.

00:02:25,622 --> 00:02:27,557
Which is it-- boys or girls?

00:02:27,624 --> 00:02:29,793
Boys.

00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,094
Preteen.

00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:34,531
I know what you're thinking.

00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:37,401
No, you don't.

(coughing)

00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:14,727
FISHER:
<i>Don't know what woke me up,</i>
<i>the smoke or the fire.</i>

00:03:14,793 --> 00:03:16,929
(coughs and groans)

00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:18,764
Next thing I remember,
I was outside,

00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,533
looking up at
the paramedics.

00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,301
Hold out your hands, please.

00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,302
(camera shutter clicking)

00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,204
Turn them over.

00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:29,808
So, uh, can you account for your
whereabouts the last 24 hours?

00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:33,078
I worked from 6:00
until 2:00 p.m.,

00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:35,481
and then I went
straight home.

00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,149
BRASS:
Where do you work?

00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,784
At the feed lot off Highway 111.

00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,419
I've got a Masters
in English Literature.

00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:41,820
I used to teach high school.

00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:44,423
Let me guess--
the kids loved you.

00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,792
Someone set fire to my house.
I almost died.

00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,061
Why don't you ask me
about that?
Okay.

00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,863
Who would want to barbecue you?

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,164
My neighbors make it clear

00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:54,133
every day how they feel
about me.

00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,701
I would start
with Mr. Hamilton.

00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,370
He threw a rock through
my window a few months back

00:03:58,437 --> 00:04:00,372
when a little
girl went missing.

00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,775
Hamilton... he barely
finished high school.

00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:05,344
He has a lot of displaced anger.

00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,612
Hmm.

00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,914
You're not writing
any of this down.

00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:10,616
I have a good memory.

00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,718
Listen, I've called you guys
half a dozen times

00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,086
in the past two years.

00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,155
I've had my house graffitied,
my windows broken,

00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:17,923
my tires slashed.
Well, you know, Carl,

00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,459
sometimes bad things happen
to bad people.

00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,428
But I'll tell you what--
(cell phone chimes)

00:04:22,494 --> 00:04:24,463
I'll let you file
a formal complaint

00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,498
down at the police station.

00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:31,704
I got to go.
You all right here?

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,372
I'm almost done.

00:04:35,507 --> 00:04:37,776
I've been living right
the past five years

00:04:37,843 --> 00:04:39,445
since I got
out of prison.

00:04:39,511 --> 00:04:41,614
I haven't gone
near a child.

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,716
I go to a support group
every week.

00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:45,017
I've even lectured
social workers

00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:46,952
on how to recognize
sexual predators.

00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:48,721
Ask my parole
officer.

00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:50,489
Doesn't that count
for something?

00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:54,093
I don't know.

00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:57,329
But it doesn't change anything,
does it?

00:04:57,396 --> 00:04:59,765
WOMAN (on TV):
<i>Police have no new clues</i>

00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,000
in the disappearance

00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:03,102
of ten-year-old Lucas Hanson
and 11-year-old Jason Crowley.

00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:05,604
Teachers and classmates
are planning a six p.m. vigil

00:05:05,671 --> 00:05:06,939
at Rockwater Elementary...

00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,808
Mrs. Hanson, I got your message.
You said it was urgent.

00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,744
You told me to go home
and look around.

00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,479
That's what I did.
My ex took 'em.

00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,581
BRASS:
I thought you told me that

00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,616
your ex-husband wasn't involved
in Lucas' life.

00:05:17,683 --> 00:05:19,618
He doesn't care
about Lucas.

00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:22,121
He barely uses his visitation,
and then, six months ago,

00:05:22,187 --> 00:05:24,690
I don't know, he-he got
into some kind of trouble.

00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:27,026
He started coming around
when Lucas was home alone.

00:05:27,092 --> 00:05:29,028
He'd gone

00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:31,230
through my mail, my checkbook.

00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:34,033
He-He stole our TVs.

00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:35,467
Daddy, please.

00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:37,469
Mama said she's gonna
call the cops.

00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:38,604
Put it back.

00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,272
Your mom can do
whatever she wants.

00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:43,175
I paid for this.
It's mine.

00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,677
(engine starting)

00:05:44,743 --> 00:05:49,148
So I told Lucas that he couldn't
be home alone anymore,

00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,383
and I took his key.

00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,786
You locked your son
out of his own house?

00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:55,020
I made arrangements

00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:56,522
with Jason's grandpa.

00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,191
The hide-a-key is
for emergencies only.

00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,126
So it's possible
that Lucas took the key.

00:06:01,193 --> 00:06:03,195
(voice breaking):
Lucas...

00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:07,233
Lucas always drops his book bag

00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:10,636
in the hallway
and turns on the TV.

00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,339
I bought him a new one.

00:06:13,405 --> 00:06:15,975
I'm positive
he didn't came home.

00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,977
Okay, all
right, all right.

00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:20,145
Give me an address
for your ex-husband.

00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:22,348
(crying)

00:06:22,414 --> 00:06:25,084
225-IHG.

00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,719
That sounds
like a license plate.

00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:29,955
Yeah, well,
he moves around a lot.

00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,590
Practically lives
out of his car.

00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,325
He... He runs

00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,995
a stripper circuit on I-15.

00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:39,265
Have you ever seen this man?

00:06:39,331 --> 00:06:41,600
No. Why?

00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,435
Uh, he's a person of interest.

00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:45,704
Lucas knows better than that.

00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:47,740
You don't talk to strangers.

00:06:47,806 --> 00:06:49,441
Ah, it's okay. Uh, yeah.

00:06:49,508 --> 00:06:51,710
Put out a broadcast
on Perry Hanson.

00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:55,247
MAN:
<i>Look, Jason and Lucas probably</i>

00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,448
just ran away.

00:06:56,515 --> 00:06:57,683
They're at that age.

00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,552
You know what I'm saying?

00:06:59,618 --> 00:07:00,853
Well, kids with no money

00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,122
and no place to go
usually come home quickly.

00:07:03,188 --> 00:07:05,891
Do you know how hard it would be
to catch them?

00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,226
Lucas is a big boy.

00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,360
And Jason...

00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,595
(chuckles):
Jason is fast.

00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,697
The red one is Jason's.

00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,600
Your grandson's
into sports, huh?

00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:15,768
Yeah, you'd think.

00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:17,036
Plays them damn video games.

00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:18,571
That's all he wants to do.

00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:21,273
I told him I don't allow
that stuff in my house.

00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,576
Boys need fresh
air and sunshine.

00:07:23,642 --> 00:07:25,244
CURTIS:
Uh, we haven't
been able to reach

00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,412
Jason's father.

00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:28,080
Have you spoken to him?

00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:32,785
You know, my son fell apart
when his wife died.

00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:34,386
Quit his job.

00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:36,755
I was basically
taking care of both of them.

00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:39,592
And then he got
a great opportunity in Houston.

00:07:39,658 --> 00:07:42,261
Couldn't get Jason
into a school until
next semester, so I said

00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,395
I'd keep him until then.

00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:45,464
(dog barking)

00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,167
How do those dogs find people?

00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,735
(laughs)

00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,503
WILLOWS:
Just like the movies,

00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,972
they sniff them out.

00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:55,074
Bet it's expensive, huh?

00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,842
You worried about the money?

00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,244
Let me tell you something.

00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,012
Boys are gonna walk
right in here

00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,513
just like that runaway bride.

00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,015
And you people
are gonna be

00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:06,252
handing me a bill
for all the looking, you watch.

00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:10,256
(siren whoops in distance)
(device beeps quietly)

00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:12,191
(trilling)

00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,195
Hey.

00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,363
Hey.

00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:18,731
I talked with
the neighbors.

00:08:18,797 --> 00:08:22,134
A Mrs. Hamilton says
she walked her dogs
around 6:00 last night.

00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,303
She saw Carl watering
his outside plants.

00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,604
He was alone.

00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,473
She also said that after dark,

00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,942
everyone locks up their doors,
and the kids stay inside.

00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,410
And let me guess.

00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,145
Nobody saw
or heard anything, right?

00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,047
Right.
Right.

00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,482
What do you got?

00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,716
Based on the burn pattern,

00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,553
the origin
of the fire was definitely here.

00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:42,221
I detected an accelerant
on the front

00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,190
of the car, and on the ground,
both consistent with gasoline.

00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:47,560
Now, the back seat's
still intact, so I figure

00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:51,330
the fire jumped from the car
to the house and fast.

00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,471
Check this out.

00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:01,540
(indistinct radio communication
in distance)

00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,177
Full shoe impression
on the concrete.

00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,213
STOKES:
Someone stepped
in the accelerant

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,547
before the car was lit.

00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,190
Treads lead toward the street.

00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,491
Could've been
a neighbor.

00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:20,926
Could've been anybody.

00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,395
(camera shutter clicking
and beeping)

(camera shutter clicking

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,955
Well, so far,
the only prints I found

00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,357
in the bedroom
are Carl Fisher's.

00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:52,758
No semen stains
in the bed.

00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:55,361
And nothing
to indicate children.

00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:57,730
SIDLE:
Well, there's tons of these.

00:09:57,796 --> 00:09:59,431
What's that?

00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:02,568
<i>Spencer's Last Straw,</i>
<i>Wiz Kids, Mayhem and McCabe,</i>

00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:03,769
<i>Secret City.</i>

00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,371
Guy lives in a trailer.

00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:06,805
He drives an old Mercury.

00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:10,609
He has a ton of expensive DVDs
and video games.

00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:11,911
There's gummi bears and chips

00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:13,212
on the floor.

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,749
House might as well be made
out of gingerbread.

00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:20,819
(siren sounds)

00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,187
Vehicle matched
the description.

00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:25,958
Went to pull him over,
he tried to split on us.

00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,927
Perry Hanson?

00:10:27,993 --> 00:10:30,462
So, Mr. Hanson,
where are the boys?

00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,331
Which boys?

00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,465
Lucas and Jason.

00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,100
My kid, Lucas?

00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,403
What, did he ditch school
or something?

00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:39,004
No, he's missing,
and so is his best friend.

00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,439
You mean, you didn't hear
the Amber Alert,

00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:41,607
or check your messages?

00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,475
You don't have to talk
to him, okay, Perry?

00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:44,743
See, I know the
frickin' Constitution.

00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,512
I bet you do.

00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,147
Somebody get Ben Franklin
out of here.

00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,783
Don't...

00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:52,484
You didn't have to cuff us,
you know?

00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:53,852
It's not like
we're frickin' terrorists.

Lucas must've

I don't know, man, kids are

00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:30,522

Yeah, well,

00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,171
I've had calls here before.

00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,640
A lot of these
houses are vacant.

00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:48,974
Perfect place
for a little

00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,976
privacy.

00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,945
Okay, let's get
around this fence.

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,781
Okay, let's hear it.

00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,850
You know my ex
is crazy, right?

00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,718
Always been
a drama queen.

00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,154
She probably told you
that I stole the TV.

00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,389
I don't care about the TV.

00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,090
When was the last time
you were in your house?

00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:08,394
Day I left--
I've never been back.

00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,330
I found this in your car.

00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,266
Guess whose front door it opens?

00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,170
Look...

00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,773
my ex will hardly
even let me see my kid.

00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,176
You know, not until I pay up
on the vaginamony that I owe.

00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,445
And that's illegal.
She doesn't care.

00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,181
Yesterday, I-I just
wanted to see my boy.

00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,351
You know? So I went over
there and he wasn't home.

00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,887
I guess I forgot
to leave the key.

00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,655
Another sad,
suffering single dad.

00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,424
You better find my kid.

00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,060

with Dawn's boyfriends.

00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:42,528
Oh, if you were me.

00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,863
She only dates scumbags
and bottom-feeders.

00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,266
At least I never
been in prison.
Well, that can change.

00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:50,669
MAN:
LVPD.

00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,905
(dog barking)

00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,306
MAN:
Kitchen's clear.

00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,880
Clear!

00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,061
Closet's clear.

00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,529
Check the rest of the house.

00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,644
It's the door itself,
not what's inside.

00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,582
There was a struggle here.
I've got blood...

00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,418
and short dark hairs
caught in the wood.

00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,753
Could be Jason's.

00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:43,856
We've got tags.

00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,061
Blood smear.

00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,829
That's far enough
away from the door.

00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,632
It's possibly
a separate event.

00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,070
Toys and candy.

00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,339
Somebody's kids
were playing here.

00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,179
Sofia...

00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:11,417
A dental bridge.

00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,619
Two premolars.

00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,991
Grandpa lied through his teeth.

00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:27,917
Recognize these?

00:14:27,984 --> 00:14:31,788
You brought me way down here to
show me a picture of my teeth?

00:14:31,855 --> 00:14:33,656
Huh?

00:14:33,723 --> 00:14:35,859
The least you could do is
give 'em back.

00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:37,994
Remember those dogs...

00:14:38,061 --> 00:14:39,696
you were so interested in?

00:14:39,762 --> 00:14:42,332
Well, they led us to
an abandoned house,

00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:43,933
not far from where you live,

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,802
and that's where
we found your teeth.

00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:47,103
We also

00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,672
found physical evidence--
blood evidence--

00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:52,175
that tells us that your
grandson and Lucas--

00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:54,344
You think you're
real smart, lady.

00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,112
Don't you?

00:14:58,081 --> 00:15:01,417
Before I start thinking
you killed those boys,

00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,852
why don't you tell
me what happened.

00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:03,920
I was defending myself.

00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,289
Against a pair of sixth graders?

00:15:06,356 --> 00:15:07,724
You're damn right.

00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,626
Two boys can cause
a lot of damages.

00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:11,161
Especially that Lucas.

00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:13,863
Hey, hey, hey!

00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,200
Dinner was at 5:00,
now it's cold-- let's go!

00:15:17,267 --> 00:15:19,369
We don't want your food.
We're going to eat at my house.

00:15:19,435 --> 00:15:21,738
My dad said I could stay
with Lucas and his mom.

00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:22,772
I like it better there.

00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,307
Don't you lie to me, boy.

00:15:24,374 --> 00:15:25,375
I'm not lying.

00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:28,878
I wish you weren't
my grandpa.

00:15:28,945 --> 00:15:31,214
Don't talk to me
like that again.

00:15:32,782 --> 00:15:33,817
(Terrance grunts)

00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,921
They had it coming.

00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:40,290
Those boys have no respect.

00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,225
They're punks.

00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:46,496
Now, I love my son,
but he didn't do right by Jason.

00:15:46,563 --> 00:15:48,431
So you thought you'd
beat respect into him.

00:15:48,498 --> 00:15:52,769
I don't need a lecture about
how to discipline my grandson.

00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:54,804
That's the trouble
with parents today,

00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,106
they're afraid of
their own kids.

00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:58,641
Sounds like they were
afraid of you.

00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,577
That's the way
it's supposed to be.

00:16:00,643 --> 00:16:02,545
What happened
after the altercation?

00:16:02,612 --> 00:16:03,713
They ran off.

00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,483
You don't want to eat,
you go hungry.

00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,318
That's how you learn.

00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,886
Why didn't you tell us
this before?

00:16:09,953 --> 00:16:12,455
I told you
what was important, lady.

00:16:14,457 --> 00:16:16,526
Now those boys are
going to be fine.

00:16:17,927 --> 00:16:20,296
What they're trying to do,
they're trying to punish me.

00:16:20,363 --> 00:16:21,764
That's what they're
trying to do.

00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:23,533
And you'll see,
they'll be back.

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,870
And then I will sit down
and I will talk to Jason.

00:16:26,936 --> 00:16:28,338
Now, what about my teeth?

00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,606
They're evidence.

00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:31,074
We'll give them back to you
when we're done.

00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,377
It was self-defense
and you can't charge me.

00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,480
Okay, I'll let you go.

00:16:37,547 --> 00:16:39,115
Until we find the boys.

00:16:41,151 --> 00:16:42,886
Well, how am I
supposed to get home?

00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:44,287
You took my car, too.

00:16:44,354 --> 00:16:47,123
There's a bus stop
down the street.

00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,798
Where is he?
What did you do?

00:16:55,865 --> 00:16:57,200
You better watch your tone.

00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,536
You swore you wouldn't
lay a hand on him.
You better

00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:00,570
get out of my face boy.

00:17:00,637 --> 00:17:01,938
Are you Gerald Crowley?

00:17:02,005 --> 00:17:03,606
Jason's dad?
Yes, ma'am.

00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:05,542
Did you know this
man is a bully?

00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,544
Big college football
coach until

00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,445
he got caught abusing
his own players.

00:17:09,512 --> 00:17:12,148
Almost got thrown
in jail.

00:17:12,215 --> 00:17:14,317
You just had to take care
of him for a few months.

00:17:14,384 --> 00:17:15,752
What the hell is wrong with you?
Okay,

00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,520
let's go talk some place.

00:17:17,587 --> 00:17:20,023
I swear...

00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,324
If you hurt Jason...

00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:24,694
I will kill you.

00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:55,859
♪ ♪

00:18:20,283 --> 00:18:23,753
♪ ♪

00:18:31,928 --> 00:18:33,696
It's a gas
container.
Yeah.

00:18:33,763 --> 00:18:35,632
I found it melted
to the floorboard.

00:18:42,005 --> 00:18:43,940
People are so predictable.

00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:46,075
Lucky for us.

00:18:46,142 --> 00:18:48,678
You want me to go
to the station,

00:18:48,745 --> 00:18:49,779
and repeat all the

00:18:49,846 --> 00:18:51,381
facts I already told you.
If you want

00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:52,515
to file a formal complaint

00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:54,450
to make it official, yes.

00:18:54,517 --> 00:18:56,553
Oh, is that a Red
Cross voucher?

00:18:56,619 --> 00:18:58,788
I'll call and make a hotel
reservation for you.

00:18:59,823 --> 00:19:00,924
I got to go
to the bathroom.

00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,559
You want me to
leave the door open?

00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:03,793
I'm too old
for you.

00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,894
(phone line rings)

00:19:04,961 --> 00:19:06,329
Grissom.

00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:07,797
Yeah, Gil, yeah.

00:19:07,864 --> 00:19:09,899
He's agreed to come to the PD.

00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:11,367
But I can't keep him there long,

00:19:11,434 --> 00:19:12,802
so let's ratchet it up a notch

00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:14,237
and get something
to hold him on, all right?

00:19:24,514 --> 00:19:26,149
Carl Fisher's on his
way in to the station

00:19:26,216 --> 00:19:27,617
to sign off on
his arson claim.

00:19:27,684 --> 00:19:29,652
Brass needs something
from us to hold him.

00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:31,621
Yeah, if he's got
those kids stashed somewhere,

00:19:31,688 --> 00:19:33,256
he could try
to take them out of

00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:34,824
state.
Or worse.

00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,661
I wish I had more.

00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:40,630
The burned shoe impression
was a size 11.

00:19:40,697 --> 00:19:42,165
Carl Fisher wears
a size 11.

00:19:42,232 --> 00:19:43,900
But none of the
patterns match up.

00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:47,403
And the shoes that Sara
found near the sofa...

00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:50,740
I can't even
identify a brand.

00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:52,242
Sorry.

00:19:55,311 --> 00:19:58,047
(rock music blasting)

00:20:02,552 --> 00:20:04,621
Didn't we talk about
this once before, Greg?

00:20:04,687 --> 00:20:08,525
I'm the one who
turned the music on.

00:20:12,028 --> 00:20:13,763
GRISSOM:
What have you found?

00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,532
A gas container.

00:20:15,598 --> 00:20:17,433
As the heat melted
the plastic,

00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,535
it formed pockets,

00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:20,970
trapping the gasoline inside.

00:20:22,338 --> 00:20:24,741
And if Hodges can

00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,877
isolate any unique
compounds from the gas,

00:20:27,944 --> 00:20:29,779
you know, like, gas DNA.

00:20:29,846 --> 00:20:31,514
Gasoline comparisons
are only credible if

00:20:31,581 --> 00:20:32,682
you have pure samples.

00:20:32,749 --> 00:20:33,983
Otherwise, there's
too many variables.

00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,752
I know that, Grissom.

00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:38,454
What I've extracted was never

00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:40,156
exposed directly
to the fire.

00:20:40,223 --> 00:20:43,626
So, if we can identify
either a dye,

00:20:43,693 --> 00:20:45,295
or a unique compound,

00:20:45,361 --> 00:20:47,730
and match it to
a particular station,

00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:51,100
then we might be able to prove
whether Carl set the fire.

00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:55,638
I'll get this to Hodges.

00:20:55,705 --> 00:20:59,309
Greg's got the Coroner's
Inquest coming up.

00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,411
He's been under a lot of stress.

00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:03,213
Maybe you could
be a little nicer

00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:05,315
to him.

00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:06,950
I just want to find these boys.

00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,551
Okay.

00:21:08,618 --> 00:21:11,488
Carl Fisher, apparently...

00:21:12,822 --> 00:21:16,192
...eats and drinks in
the backseat of his car.

00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:18,161
I found it in
a seat pocket.

00:21:18,228 --> 00:21:19,329
Fruit punch?

00:21:19,395 --> 00:21:20,563
Or a mixer.

00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:26,870
Whiskey-- I did not
find the bottle.

00:21:26,936 --> 00:21:28,571
And... so?

00:21:30,807 --> 00:21:34,410
Mushrooms, picked off
a cheese pizza.

00:21:34,477 --> 00:21:35,979
I found it stuffed
between the cushions

00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,547
in the backseat
of the car.

00:21:37,614 --> 00:21:40,016
If you're an adult, and
you don't like mushrooms,

00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,085
you don't order them.

00:21:44,454 --> 00:21:46,656
Oh, did I tell you, you
can't check into the hotel

00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,791
till after 4:00.

00:21:48,858 --> 00:21:50,026
I'll find something to do.

00:21:50,093 --> 00:21:52,128
Well, I'm wondering
if you might hang out

00:21:52,195 --> 00:21:53,229
and volunteer
your services here.

00:21:53,296 --> 00:21:54,864
Isn't that what you do?

00:21:54,931 --> 00:21:57,400
Talk to groups about
sexual deviancy?

00:21:57,467 --> 00:21:59,402
You want me to help
you do your job?

00:21:59,469 --> 00:22:01,204
Help you find those
missing kids?

00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:03,306
Yeah, that's what I want.

00:22:03,373 --> 00:22:05,475
So you going to
help us out or what?

00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:09,045
I may be able to
offer some insights.

00:22:10,713 --> 00:22:13,016
But only if I can talk
to the other guy.

00:22:14,651 --> 00:22:17,253
I'm a victim of abuse.

00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,588
My older brother.

00:22:18,655 --> 00:22:22,258
I was eight.

00:22:22,325 --> 00:22:24,427
He was much older-- 16.

00:22:24,494 --> 00:22:26,095
He was jealous and angry.

00:22:26,162 --> 00:22:27,664
He wanted to destroy me.

00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:30,166
It's not offered
as an excuse,

00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:32,602
but it might explain

00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:34,671
why I'm here
with you right now.

00:22:41,845 --> 00:22:44,981
These are known child
molesters living

00:22:45,048 --> 00:22:47,050
within our
search radius.

00:22:51,421 --> 00:22:53,690
I met him in prison.

00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:56,426
He's an environmental offender.

00:22:56,493 --> 00:22:57,594
Situational.

00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,129
Only molests members
of his own family.

00:23:00,196 --> 00:23:02,131
Small world--
he's in my support group.

00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,468
Your boys are too ripe for him.

00:23:05,535 --> 00:23:07,504
He likes toddlers.

00:23:10,907 --> 00:23:13,209
A couple of these guys
are mysopeds--

00:23:13,276 --> 00:23:14,978
aggressive pedophiles.

00:23:15,044 --> 00:23:17,947
Some of their pleasures derive
from physical violence.

00:23:18,014 --> 00:23:21,050
They like to molest,
then beat, and sometimes

00:23:21,117 --> 00:23:23,253
kill their victims.

00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,054
But these guys aren't killers.

00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:28,124
Who said the boys were dead?

00:23:28,191 --> 00:23:30,827
They've been gone a long time.

00:23:32,028 --> 00:23:33,429
(cell phone chimes)

00:23:44,407 --> 00:23:46,009
Bad news?

00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:54,417
OFFICER:
Sir, you're gonna
have to stand back.

00:23:54,484 --> 00:23:56,252
You're gonna have to
stand back, ma'am.

00:24:00,623 --> 00:24:02,625
(screams)

00:24:27,908 --> 00:24:30,511
There's a scrape
on his left cheek.

00:24:30,578 --> 00:24:32,413
Yeah, there's some
minor bruising

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,582
on the knuckles
of his right hand.

00:24:34,648 --> 00:24:37,318
Probably
a defensive wound.

00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:42,089
Catherine found some

00:24:42,156 --> 00:24:44,058
brown fabric on a fence nearby.

00:24:45,092 --> 00:24:46,660
I bet it's from these shorts.

00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:53,601
Hey, super, you didn't

00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:55,769
leave this shirt inside out
when you took it

00:24:55,836 --> 00:24:57,538
off the body,
did you?
No.

00:24:57,605 --> 00:24:58,939
Could be a redress.

00:24:59,006 --> 00:25:02,243
Yeah. Yeah, it could.

00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:03,911
Okay...

00:25:03,978 --> 00:25:06,981
Well, SAE kit should tell us
whether or not

00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,616
he was molested.

00:25:10,017 --> 00:25:11,252
Sometimes this job gets to me.

00:25:11,318 --> 00:25:12,953
Yeah, me, too, buddy.

00:25:14,288 --> 00:25:16,624
Me, too.

00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:19,793
Grandpa play golf?

00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,929
I think golf's a little
too rich for his blood.

00:25:21,996 --> 00:25:24,565
Doesn't mean he didn't
follow them here.

00:25:24,632 --> 00:25:25,933
A killer wouldn't
take time

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,735
to bury him that way,
it was too nice.

00:25:27,801 --> 00:25:29,403
It suggests
whoever killed him

00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,005
cared about him,
knew him, you know?

00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,641
Well, my money's still
on the pedophile.

00:25:35,543 --> 00:25:36,744
A ten-year old could
fit in there, huh?

00:25:36,811 --> 00:25:38,179
Jason's a skinny kid.

00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,248
(indistinct police radio
communication in distance)

00:25:45,853 --> 00:25:48,255
I didn't see this boy
at the pizza place,

00:25:48,322 --> 00:25:49,657
but I remember the little guy.

00:25:49,723 --> 00:25:50,925
He had a fat lip.

00:25:50,991 --> 00:25:52,159
I asked him where he got it.

00:25:52,226 --> 00:25:54,094
What did he tell you?
He said his

00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:55,429
grandfather was a bully.

00:25:55,496 --> 00:25:58,032
I started to walk out
with him and I was worried.

00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,701
But he swore he was safe.

00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:03,170
With friends.
Did you see who
he was with?

00:26:03,237 --> 00:26:05,372
Some white guy.

00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,674
It was pretty dark.

00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,042
And there was no
one else with him?

00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,276
Not that I saw.

00:26:09,343 --> 00:26:12,446
But they ordered
an extra-large
with everything--

00:26:12,513 --> 00:26:14,682
and that's 18 slices-- and
a full liter of cherry soda.

00:26:15,883 --> 00:26:17,051
If it matters, they sat

00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,385
in the parking lot
for a while.

00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,154
Is there anything you can
remember about the car?

00:26:20,221 --> 00:26:21,322
Make? Color?

00:26:21,388 --> 00:26:22,556
It was a Mercury Marquis.

00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:24,725
Are you positive?
Yeah.

00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,160
My boyfriend's a street...

00:26:26,227 --> 00:26:28,529
uh, he's into cars, so...

00:26:28,596 --> 00:26:30,297
I know cars.

00:26:31,732 --> 00:26:33,734
No sand in his nasal
passages or lungs.

00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,636
He was dead before
he was buried.

00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,974
Are those palm prints
on his sternum?

00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,010
Consistent in position
and pressure with CPR.

00:26:43,077 --> 00:26:44,545
Also found air in his stomach.

00:26:44,612 --> 00:26:46,347
<i>If you don't tilt</i>
<i>the head back,</i>

00:26:46,413 --> 00:26:47,748
<i>the trachea doesn't open.</i>

00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,950
<i>It forces air into the stomach</i>
<i>instead of the lungs</i>

00:26:50,017 --> 00:26:51,752
<i>and that's bad CPR.</i>

00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,088
Now, what kind of a killer

00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:55,489
performs CPR
on their victim?

00:26:55,556 --> 00:26:57,858
Well, maybe he didn't
mean to kill him.

00:26:57,925 --> 00:27:00,561
His pupils were dilated.

00:27:00,628 --> 00:27:01,695
I found a
subdural hematoma

00:27:01,762 --> 00:27:03,531
in the left
frontal lobe.

00:27:03,597 --> 00:27:05,232
That's your preliminary
cause of death.

00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:07,468
I sent samples to
Tox, of course.

00:27:07,535 --> 00:27:09,537
Catherine found
blood smear

00:27:09,603 --> 00:27:11,539
on the floor
where he was playing.

00:27:11,605 --> 00:27:14,408
He has a laceration
on his cheek.

00:27:14,475 --> 00:27:16,544
And the grandpa admits
he pushed Lucas down

00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,712
when he hit his head.
Except that, by itself,

00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:20,648
the head injury wouldn't
have been immediately fatal

00:27:20,714 --> 00:27:23,417
or necessarily
incapacitating.

00:27:23,484 --> 00:27:26,453
But, yeah, he would've
had a headache.

00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:32,059
Hey, got some gasoline
samples for you.

00:27:32,126 --> 00:27:34,528
Thanks, Greg. It's gonna
take a little while
to fill my tank.

00:27:34,595 --> 00:27:35,563
Why don't I get
you a funnel?

00:27:35,629 --> 00:27:37,064
Kidding.

00:27:37,131 --> 00:27:38,465
You think your arson case

00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:39,600
has something to do
with these missing kids?

00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:41,969
Well, Carl Fisher lives
in the neighborhood,

00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:43,871
but, so far,
his alibi checks out.

00:27:43,938 --> 00:27:47,274
I don't know why pedophiles
just don't kill themselves.

00:27:47,341 --> 00:27:49,076
Who knows,
he might have tried.

00:27:49,143 --> 00:27:50,344
I collected these

00:27:50,411 --> 00:27:52,146
from service stations
closest to his house.

00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:53,280
Did you consider...

00:27:53,347 --> 00:27:55,416
That he might have filled up
on his way to work

00:27:55,483 --> 00:27:56,851
or anywhere else in Vegas?

00:27:56,917 --> 00:27:58,052
Yes-- that's why

00:27:58,118 --> 00:28:00,154
I wanted to get you
started on these

00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:02,189
before I hit the other
stations on the list.

00:28:02,256 --> 00:28:04,258
Good job, gas-hopper.

00:28:09,263 --> 00:28:11,265
Okay, then...

00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:16,003
...what would you do

00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,172
if you were going
to take those boys?

00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:20,708
I would be studying them.

00:28:20,774 --> 00:28:23,310
Do they like sports?
Comic books?

00:28:23,377 --> 00:28:26,480
Do they skip school?
Have any friends?

00:28:26,547 --> 00:28:28,582
Good parents,
or are they neglected?

00:28:28,649 --> 00:28:29,984
Unhappy? Angry?

00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,685
And then?

00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:33,954
What do you do
when you like a woman?

00:28:34,021 --> 00:28:36,123
It's a game of seduction.

00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:39,727
Once you know what they like,
you make contact.

00:28:39,793 --> 00:28:41,795
You start slowly, play it cool.

00:28:41,862 --> 00:28:43,030
Especially with boys.

00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:46,033
It's about building trust.

00:28:47,635 --> 00:28:49,403
Like you're doing with me.

00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,506
Do you like mushrooms, Carl?

00:28:52,573 --> 00:28:54,742
I like all
the nightshade vegetables.

00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:56,043
Are you going to buy me dinner?

00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:01,615
We found mushrooms
in the backseat of your car.

00:29:01,682 --> 00:29:03,818
Is this turning
into an interrogation?

00:29:06,253 --> 00:29:08,055
You're free to leave.

00:29:11,025 --> 00:29:12,293
On the night the
boys disappeared,

00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:14,695
witnesses said they saw
them sitting in a car

00:29:14,762 --> 00:29:17,698
with a man,
eating pizza.

00:29:17,765 --> 00:29:21,035
You take a date out
to a nice steak dinner.

00:29:21,101 --> 00:29:22,703
Kids would rather have

00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,705
hamburgers or pizza.

00:29:24,772 --> 00:29:27,208
Did you take the kids
out for pizza?

00:29:27,274 --> 00:29:30,811
No, I'm talking hypothetically.

00:29:30,878 --> 00:29:32,313
You must be desperate

00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:33,981
for a suspect,
or a scapegoat.

00:29:34,048 --> 00:29:37,151
Do you need to give the press
something to chew on?

00:29:37,218 --> 00:29:39,720
We just found
Lucas Hanson's dead body.

00:29:39,787 --> 00:29:41,455
They're chewing on that.

00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:46,427
What about the other boy?

00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:48,929
He's still missing.

00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:52,299
In my opinion,
if someone killed one boy...

00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:55,603
...he'd kill them both.

00:30:05,913 --> 00:30:08,982
So, we're working on a couple
of Jason sightings.

00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:11,618
Camper in Red Rock
spotted a kid

00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,687
that looks like Jason,
so I sent Vega.

00:30:13,754 --> 00:30:16,490
And Sofia is on her way
to Bullhead City, Arizona.

00:30:16,556 --> 00:30:18,792
A woman on a bus
called the cops.

00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,794
She swears that Jason's
sitting next to her.

00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:22,663
That's what I've got.

00:30:22,729 --> 00:30:24,197
Any luck with Carl Fisher?

00:30:24,264 --> 00:30:25,465
I don't know.

00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,367
He wants something from me...

00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:29,736
or he wouldn't still be here.

00:30:57,965 --> 00:31:00,801
♪ ♪

00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,419
(machine whirs)

00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,440
SANDERS (on phone):
Sanders?

00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:41,875
You can stop gassing up.

00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:43,076
I've got a match.

00:31:43,143 --> 00:31:46,313
AvCon on Buffalo Canyon.
Pump six.

00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,385
Where did he board?

00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,753
Vegas depot.

00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:54,021
Was he with anyone?

00:31:55,389 --> 00:31:56,890
I'm not gonna
report you.

00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,425
You can tell me the truth.

00:31:58,492 --> 00:32:00,394
Children aren't supposed
to travel alone,

00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,496
but it was a full bus
when I took off today.

00:32:02,562 --> 00:32:03,797
I couldn't tell you.

00:32:03,864 --> 00:32:05,499
He was definitely
by himself.

00:32:05,565 --> 00:32:07,067
I saw this, I
knew it was him.

00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:08,735
DRIVER:
I radioed my dispatcher.

00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:10,837
She told me to pullover
at the next town,

00:32:10,904 --> 00:32:13,006
make sure he doesn't get off,
and wait for you.

00:32:13,073 --> 00:32:14,508
Thank you for your help.

00:32:14,575 --> 00:32:15,776
Can you tell me

00:32:15,842 --> 00:32:17,411
where he's sitting?
Back row.

00:32:32,926 --> 00:32:34,161
Hey.

00:32:36,263 --> 00:32:38,999
My name's Sofia. Are you Jason?

00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,804
There's nothing to be
afraid of, Jason.

00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,340
You're not in trouble.
I just want to help you.

00:32:46,406 --> 00:32:49,443
You're on your way
to Texas to see
your dad, right?

00:32:51,745 --> 00:32:53,480
It's just...

00:32:53,547 --> 00:32:54,915
well, went you went missing,

00:32:54,982 --> 00:32:58,151
your dad flew to Las Vegas
to find you.

00:32:58,218 --> 00:33:00,454
He's waiting for you.

00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,222
Can I take you to him?

00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,331
BROWN:
<i>Is that the tox report</i>
<i>for Lucas Hanson?</i>

00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:13,867
His blood alcohol--
point one six.

00:33:13,934 --> 00:33:16,236
Geez. It's a drunk kid.

00:33:16,303 --> 00:33:18,972
And Sara found a whiskey cap
in Carl Fisher's car.

00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,074
Oh, perfect way

00:33:21,141 --> 00:33:23,977
to loosen up a little boy--
give him pizza and whiskey.

00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:25,512
Yeah, well, listen to this.

00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:28,181
According to the report,
Lucas also had 98 micrograms

00:33:28,248 --> 00:33:30,083
per milliliter of salicylates

00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,652
in his system.
Well, I guess

00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,854
he took the aspirin
after he hit his head.

00:33:33,921 --> 00:33:35,489
Wonder who gave him that.

00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,457
Probably the same
responsible adult

00:33:37,524 --> 00:33:39,393
that gave him the whiskey.

00:33:42,462 --> 00:33:46,500
FISHER:
So, you think I got
the boys drunk,

00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,068
and then killed them?

00:33:48,135 --> 00:33:50,203
Not exactly.

00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:53,040
We found Jason Crowley.

00:33:53,106 --> 00:33:54,808
Alive.

00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:57,077
On a bus headed
for Houston.

00:33:57,144 --> 00:34:00,080
One of the lucky ones.

00:34:10,724 --> 00:34:13,860
It's okay, Jason.

00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,929
Daddy's here, boy.
Daddy's here.

00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,437
That bus ticket costs $95
for a child under 12.

00:34:23,503 --> 00:34:26,006
Jason's grandfather
doesn't keep any cash

00:34:26,073 --> 00:34:29,042
in the house, and he doesn't
give him an allowance,

00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,612
so where do you think
Jason got the cash?

00:34:31,678 --> 00:34:33,714
Maybe he stole it.

00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,049
From whom?
I don't know.

00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:38,285
Why don't you ask him?

00:34:38,352 --> 00:34:40,554
I will.

00:34:43,991 --> 00:34:46,426
Do you get a lot
of migraines, Gil?

00:34:49,062 --> 00:34:52,266
You should ask your doctor for
a prescription of sumatriptan.

00:34:52,332 --> 00:34:54,334
Works for me.

00:34:58,238 --> 00:35:01,074
Captain Brass wants
to put you in a lineup.

00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:03,577
If you'll agree to it,

00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:05,846
then I think
this will all be over with.

00:35:05,913 --> 00:35:08,749
Then let's do it.

00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,651
(light switch clacks)

00:35:10,717 --> 00:35:13,320
SOFIA:
Do you recognize
anyone, Jason?

00:35:15,756 --> 00:35:17,524
Which number?

00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,165
Number two?

00:35:25,232 --> 00:35:27,267
Yes.

00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:30,170
Was he the man
who kidnapped you and Lucas?

00:35:33,574 --> 00:35:35,976
Jason,

00:35:36,043 --> 00:35:38,612
remember, you can see him,
but he can't see you.

00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:41,448
Did number two
hurt Lucas?

00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:44,785
MAN (distant, distorted):
<i>I'll kill your dad</i>
<i>if you tell...</i>

00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,853
No, ma'am.

00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,303
The gas DNA panned out.

00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,138
It did?

00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:08,175
Yeah. Hodges and I traced
the gas back

00:36:08,242 --> 00:36:10,010
to a service station
near Fisher's house.

00:36:10,077 --> 00:36:11,178
Station had security cameras.

00:36:11,245 --> 00:36:12,512
Got him filling up

00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:15,382
the night of the fire, so I went
through the electronic receipts.

00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:16,717
All of them.

00:36:16,783 --> 00:36:19,219
Carl Fisher purchased
16 gallons.

00:36:19,286 --> 00:36:20,687
And?

00:36:20,754 --> 00:36:22,889
His Mercury Marquis
only holds 14,

00:36:22,956 --> 00:36:24,891
so, where did he put the extra

00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:26,093
two gallons?

00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:28,528
In a plastic gas can?

00:36:28,595 --> 00:36:31,098
All of which he paid for
with his ATM.

00:36:31,164 --> 00:36:32,366
Not the same as cash.

00:36:32,432 --> 00:36:35,402
Thanks, Greg.

00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:42,409
No one has told me
why I'm being detained.

00:36:42,476 --> 00:36:43,810
Arson is a felony.

00:36:43,877 --> 00:36:45,579
You torched your own car.

00:36:45,646 --> 00:36:47,848
We have video
surveillance

00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:51,785
and electronic records
that show you purchasing gas

00:36:51,852 --> 00:36:53,387
and a gas can.

00:36:53,453 --> 00:36:55,489
I was trying
to scam my insurance company.

00:36:55,555 --> 00:36:56,757
I needed the money.

00:36:56,823 --> 00:36:58,158
You were destroying evidence

00:36:58,225 --> 00:37:00,494
of Lucas Hanson
and Jason Crowley in your car.

00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:04,798
And I think
you helped kill Lucas.

00:37:04,865 --> 00:37:06,900
No, I didn't.

00:37:06,967 --> 00:37:10,904
And you're not charging me
for that, so I'm guessing

00:37:10,971 --> 00:37:13,273
Jason didn't pick me
out of the lineup.

00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,809
He told us he knew you.

00:37:15,876 --> 00:37:19,479
Kill one, kill both, remember?

00:37:22,015 --> 00:37:24,918
If I <i>had</i> killed Lucas,

00:37:24,985 --> 00:37:27,688
I would have killed Jason.

00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:31,658
(sighs)

00:37:31,725 --> 00:37:34,861
Lucas was looking for a father.

00:37:34,928 --> 00:37:37,631
His real one was an accident
of biology.

00:37:37,698 --> 00:37:39,666
His mother was limited,
always working.

00:37:39,733 --> 00:37:42,970
He was lonely.

00:37:43,036 --> 00:37:44,605
<i>He</i> found <i>me.</i>

00:37:44,671 --> 00:37:48,842
LUCAS:
I see you every day.

00:37:48,909 --> 00:37:52,145
You play a lot, huh?

00:37:52,212 --> 00:37:53,780
Maybe we can play sometime.

00:37:55,682 --> 00:37:57,451
My best friend's
always grounded.

00:37:57,517 --> 00:37:58,518
How about tomorrow?

00:38:02,756 --> 00:38:04,191
Did you know

00:38:04,258 --> 00:38:06,860
that most parents spend less
than 20 minutes a day

00:38:06,927 --> 00:38:08,762
of quality time
with their kids?

00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:10,497
Lucas was starved
for attention.

00:38:10,564 --> 00:38:13,000
All his mother did
was complain about his father

00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:14,968
and how he'd abandoned them.

00:38:15,035 --> 00:38:17,437
Do you know
what that does to a child?

00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,206
It doesn't kill them.

00:38:21,909 --> 00:38:23,844
Okay, Carl,

00:38:23,911 --> 00:38:25,612
just tell me what happened.

00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,748
(sighs)

00:38:27,814 --> 00:38:29,783
Lucas and Jason had gotten
into it

00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,685
with Jason's grandfather.

00:38:31,752 --> 00:38:33,520
He knocked
the boys around.

00:38:33,587 --> 00:38:36,857
They ran to Lucas' house,
but couldn't get in,

00:38:36,924 --> 00:38:38,558
so they came to me.

00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:39,726
(knocking)

00:38:41,428 --> 00:38:44,231
(crickets chirping)

00:38:44,298 --> 00:38:46,733
<i>I explained to them</i>
<i>that hitting wasn't okay.</i>

00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,735
I said Jason needed
to call his father

00:38:48,802 --> 00:38:50,470
and tell him what was going on.

00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,239
Did you let them
use your phone?

00:38:52,306 --> 00:38:53,640
But they were too upset.

00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:57,144
When the grandfather
pushed Lucas, he hit his head.

00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,146
I gave him a couple
of aspirin.

00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,081
Well, if he didn't want
to call his mother,

00:39:01,148 --> 00:39:02,249
why didn't you call her?

00:39:02,316 --> 00:39:03,483
I couldn't risk it.

00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,085
She might have turned me in.

00:39:05,152 --> 00:39:07,588
So, instead,
you took them for pizza?

00:39:07,654 --> 00:39:10,390
I didn't touch him.

00:39:10,457 --> 00:39:12,392
I didn't want to hurt him.

00:39:12,459 --> 00:39:13,860
You gave him liquor.

00:39:13,927 --> 00:39:16,096
I stopped and bought
some whiskey before we picked up

00:39:16,163 --> 00:39:18,599
the pizza-- I was nervous about
them being in the car with me.

00:39:18,665 --> 00:39:20,233
I didn't want
to go back to prison.

00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,768
And you wanted
to get them drunk.

00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:26,907
They... They just wanted
to try it.

00:39:26,974 --> 00:39:28,942
I gave them a taste.

00:39:29,009 --> 00:39:32,079
GRISSOM:
<i>It was more than a taste, Carl.</i>

00:39:32,145 --> 00:39:34,214
<i>Lucas' blood alcohol level</i>
<i>was point one six.</i>

00:39:34,281 --> 00:39:36,750
<i>That's twice the legal limit</i>
<i>for an adult.</i>

00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:40,520
Why didn't you take them home?

00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,322
They didn't want to go home.

00:39:42,389 --> 00:39:44,791
They wanted an adventure.

00:39:44,858 --> 00:39:46,093
<i>I promised them a dollar</i>

00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:47,894
<i>for every golf ball</i>
<i>they brought back.</i>

00:39:47,961 --> 00:39:50,564
<i>Lucas wasn't feeling well, so</i>
<i>he stayed in the car with me.</i>

00:39:50,631 --> 00:39:53,233
GRISSOM:
<i>And you knew that Jason</i>
<i>wanted money, so he could go</i>

00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,102
<i>to Texas and see his dad,</i>

00:39:55,168 --> 00:39:57,571
so you bribed him in order

00:39:57,638 --> 00:39:58,939
to be alone
with Lucas.

00:39:59,006 --> 00:40:00,374
I didn't molest him.

00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,708
Who took his shirt off?

00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:03,744
He was hot.
What were you
gonna do to him

00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,045
once his shirt was off?

00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:06,780
It was innocent.

00:40:06,847 --> 00:40:08,415
He wasn't feeling well.

00:40:08,482 --> 00:40:10,417
He laid

00:40:10,484 --> 00:40:12,653
his head in my lap.

00:40:14,655 --> 00:40:17,457
I touched his hair.

00:40:17,524 --> 00:40:20,360
I didn't want to...

00:40:22,362 --> 00:40:25,832
I loved him.

00:40:25,899 --> 00:40:27,834
I loved Lucas,
and he loved me.

00:40:27,901 --> 00:40:29,770
Is that what you think?

00:40:29,836 --> 00:40:33,173
Then why didn't
you help him?

00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,142
He told you he hit his head.

00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:37,344
He was in pain.

00:40:37,411 --> 00:40:38,879
He had a concussion, Carl.

00:40:38,946 --> 00:40:40,414
You must have
known that.

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,516
I'm sure he was dizzy,
probably had no appetite.

00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:44,184
Maybe he was even
slurring his words,

00:40:44,251 --> 00:40:46,086
but you didn't
care about that,

00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:49,256
because you wanted
what you wanted.

00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:51,458
(panting)

00:40:51,525 --> 00:40:53,961
Lucas?!

00:40:54,027 --> 00:40:56,296
GRISSOM:
<i>His brain was bleeding.</i>

00:40:56,363 --> 00:40:58,198
Now, most kids won't die
from that,

00:40:58,265 --> 00:40:59,933
because someone
who really loves them

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,301
takes them to the hospital,

00:41:01,368 --> 00:41:04,371
but instead, you gave him
alcohol and aspirin,

00:41:04,438 --> 00:41:06,640
a lethal combination
for his head injury.

00:41:06,707 --> 00:41:09,977
It prevented his
blood from clotting.

00:41:10,043 --> 00:41:13,614
You killed him, Carl.

00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:19,219
<i>And you would have killed</i>
<i>Jason, too,</i>

00:41:19,286 --> 00:41:23,724
<i>except he ran away from you</i>
<i>and crawled into a drain pipe.</i>

00:41:29,796 --> 00:41:31,298
Hey.

00:41:31,365 --> 00:41:32,666
(panting)

00:41:32,733 --> 00:41:34,868
Hey, what are you
doing in there?

00:41:34,935 --> 00:41:36,203
You're not listening to me.

00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:38,505
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

00:41:38,572 --> 00:41:41,541
I need you to believe me.

00:41:41,608 --> 00:41:43,543
I don't.

00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,312
You had choices.

00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:47,981
You made the wrong ones.

00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:51,752
And now this little boy is gone.

00:41:58,392 --> 00:42:00,327
BRASS:
<i>So I talked Voris</i>

00:42:00,394 --> 00:42:01,728
into violating parole,

00:42:01,795 --> 00:42:03,730
and we're adding the charges
of negligent homicide.

00:42:03,797 --> 00:42:05,699
You're not gonna see
Carl for a long time.

00:42:05,766 --> 00:42:09,002
Also, we, uh...
we've arrested

00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:11,505
the grandpa, Terrance
Crowley, for child abuse.

00:42:11,572 --> 00:42:13,840
Everybody wins.

00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:15,876
Except Lucas.

00:42:15,943 --> 00:42:18,445
You're gonna fry.

00:42:18,512 --> 00:42:20,013
You drove him
right to it...!

00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,014
You did this!

00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:23,050
You did this!
I'll kill you!

00:42:25,419 --> 00:42:27,821
MARGARET FINN:
Where is Carl Fisher?

00:42:27,888 --> 00:42:29,790
You can't take
him to County...

00:42:29,856 --> 00:42:31,959
Mr. Crowley's
civil rights were violated.

00:42:32,025 --> 00:42:33,760
This department
is racist.

00:42:33,827 --> 00:42:35,395
FINN:
Excuse me! I
was here first.

00:42:35,462 --> 00:42:36,797
My client has been
detained illegally.

00:42:36,863 --> 00:42:39,099
LEWIS:
You cannot
charge Mister...

00:42:52,713 --> 00:42:54,915
(faint, indistinct voices
and laughter in the distance)

00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:11,932
(sighs)
