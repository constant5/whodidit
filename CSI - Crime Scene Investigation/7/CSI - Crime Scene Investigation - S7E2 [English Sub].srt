Yeah, that's my real photo
on my profile.

00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:23,917
Excuse me.

00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,286
Well, I exercise a lot.

00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:28,154
Kind of an animal
about it.

00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,027
Hey.

00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,395
Did you see me last night?

00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,931
Yeah, you were feeling no pain.

00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,267
Who was I with?

00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:42,402
Describe him.

00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,739
Was he white,
black, tall?

00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,274
Hair color, car?

00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,643
Look, lady, I get paid
not to notice.

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,849
Who was room 229
registered to?

00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,288
Catherine Willows.

00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:05,825
You used your credit card.

00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:20,607
I think Malibu Barbie did it.

00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,742
Well, then there's
a lot more to Barbie

00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,844
than just a pretty
face, 'cause this

00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:28,348
is a perfect half-inch scale
model of the the room.

00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:29,549
And assuming that the killer

00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,284
is the same person
who made the miniature...

00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,986
It would of taken weeks.

00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:34,788
Maybe even months to create

00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,457
with this kind of detail.

00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,492
Certainly qualifies
as premeditation.

00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,028
Yeah, but take a look
at he blood pools.

00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,764
They're identical.

00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,865
There's no predicting

00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,034
a blood pool,
it's inherently random.

00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,037
Killer must of stuck around
to match the scene.

00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,917
It's real blood.

00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,256
That is a level of obsession

00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,192
that gives even you
a run for your money.

00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:19,566
"If Dusty Fell,"
Izzy Delancy.

00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,068
I have never heard of him.

00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,670
Probably before your time.

00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,572
I'll download it.

00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:29,042
I checked the perimeter,
property is gated with a code.

00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:33,380
There is no sign of forced entry
on the windows or the doors.

00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:36,049
Of course if a girl can get into
Brad Pitt's underwear drawer,

00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:39,586
and take a nap on his bed,
I guess anything is possible.

00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:45,492
Lividity suggests he
hasn't been moved.

00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,461
He was probably
sitting right here
when he was killed.

00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,734
Looks like blunt
force trauma.

00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,871
No spatter

00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:58,972
or cast off.

00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,912

Oh, great, you're here,
thanks for coming.

00:04:53,785 --> 00:04:56,121
I can't believe you're leaving
Izzy Delancy's death scene.

00:04:56,188 --> 00:04:57,723
Groupies are already
starting to gather.

00:04:57,789 --> 00:04:59,791
I have something that
I have to take care of.

00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:01,493
Nick and Sofia are
talking with the family,

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,829
Grissom's in the kitchen,
you can process the bedrooms?

00:05:03,895 --> 00:05:05,697
Thanks.

00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:17,276
Mrs. Delancy?

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,811
(sighs)

00:05:19,878 --> 00:05:22,881
No, that's Mrs. Delancy.

00:05:24,716 --> 00:05:26,952
I'm Annie, the nanny.

00:05:28,253 --> 00:05:30,188
I'm going to need
to photograph your hands.

00:05:30,255 --> 00:05:31,890
To look for blood, right?

00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:35,294
Blood evidence, yeah,
and defensive wounds.

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,728
I'm also going to get a sample

00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,665
of your DNA and
your fingerprints.

00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:41,667
So, why don't you
hand little Nora

00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:43,368
to her mom for right now, okay?

00:05:43,435 --> 00:05:47,139
No, Mrs. D never holds the baby.

00:05:47,205 --> 00:05:48,740
(whispering):
She's got a bad back.

00:05:56,715 --> 00:05:57,683
I should warn you,

00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:58,817
I'm a little freaked.

00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:00,085
When I get nervous
or scared or whatever

00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,753
I have this problem
where I talk a lot.

00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,922
I've had it since I was little
I just keep talking...

00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,490
You found the body?

00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:12,197
Tuesday is Chinese.

00:06:12,264 --> 00:06:14,199
Izzy insists...

00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:15,634
on having...

00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:17,936
a really strict eating schedule.

00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,805
I have to start cooking by 4:00

00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:21,873
and when I went
into the kitchen...

00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:26,712
Baby's don't eat bok choy.

00:06:26,778 --> 00:06:28,213
Yeah, I wonder what
you're going to have for--

00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,281
(gasps)

00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:32,484
(screaming)

00:06:34,486 --> 00:06:36,521
I immediately called 9-1-1.

00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:40,459
Speaking of which, can I get
a copy of the police report?

00:06:42,628 --> 00:06:45,597
Why don't you...
Where is your shirt?

00:06:45,664 --> 00:06:48,033
(laughs)

00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,668
Right after it all went down

00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:52,671
the baby spit up on it
and I put it in the laundry.
Mmm.

00:06:52,738 --> 00:06:54,106
It happens
all the time.

00:06:54,172 --> 00:06:55,874
Nobody minds.

00:07:06,018 --> 00:07:08,487
(camera shutter clicking)

00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:32,377
Hey, what's
going on?

00:07:32,444 --> 00:07:34,947
I may have been roofied
and raped.

00:07:35,013 --> 00:07:36,148
I woke up here.

00:07:36,214 --> 00:07:37,282
What?

00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:38,483
I, uh, improvised

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,851
my own a rape kit.

00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,822
I've got pubic combing,
nail scrapings, vaginal swab,

00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:45,324
urine samples...
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
did you call it in?

00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,858
I called you.

00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,494
Catherine, doing it yourself

00:07:49,561 --> 00:07:51,797
is going to make anything
that you get inadmissible.

00:07:51,863 --> 00:07:53,031
Yeah, I know procedure,

00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,266
I didn't want
an official investigation.

00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,701
I-I just want to know
what happened.

00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,903
Okay, all right.

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,205
Uh...

00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:02,741
I got to get this, uh,
stuff to the lab.

00:08:02,808 --> 00:08:04,710
Room 229,
it's right up there.

00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:05,711
Please print it.

00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:09,348
And keep it between us.

00:08:09,414 --> 00:08:10,349
Okay.

00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:11,783
Thanks.

00:08:19,758 --> 00:08:21,393
I went out for a latte.

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,928
I got home around 5:00.

00:08:22,995 --> 00:08:25,964
I never even went
into the kitchen.

00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:28,700
I just went straight upstairs
and took a shower.

00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:30,168
(sighs)

00:08:30,235 --> 00:08:33,772
God that means that he was dead
this whole time.

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,377
We believe whoever killed your
husband had access to the house.

00:08:38,443 --> 00:08:41,113
Yeah, do you think anyone else
had the... the gate code?

00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:44,349
Just the housekeepers.

00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:47,753
And the handymen,
and the pool guys.

00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,388
And the gardeners,
and the...

00:08:49,454 --> 00:08:51,023
messengers and...

00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:52,991
the caterers.

00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,082
MRS. DELANCY:
<i>I can tell you where you should</i>

00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:18,150
start looking.

00:09:19,818 --> 00:09:21,820
(whispers):
Sven.

00:09:24,723 --> 00:09:26,758
Are you accusing your son
of killing your husband?

00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:29,194
(laughs)

00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,898
He is not my son.

00:09:32,965 --> 00:09:35,968
That's Izzy's kid
from his first wife.

00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,102
Oh.

00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:38,637
He has real problems.

00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:41,773
(whispering):
His mom was like a cokehead
or something.

00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,200
CURTIS:
Hey, how you doing?

00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,805
How you
doing man?

00:10:13,872 --> 00:10:16,141
I've been better.

00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,277
What time did you
get back from school?

00:10:18,343 --> 00:10:20,879
Around 4:00.

00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:22,514
And then what did you do?

00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:25,183
Homework, games.

00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,218
Did you...

00:10:26,285 --> 00:10:28,687
see your dad at all?

00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:33,358
No, I usually don't see him
until dinner.

00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,160
And then...

00:10:35,227 --> 00:10:37,296
I get picked up right after, so.

00:10:37,362 --> 00:10:38,363
By who?

00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:41,566
My mom.

00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:44,002
You don't live here full time?

00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:46,705
Tuesdays and every other
Saturday.

00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:52,477
Well, that's got to be tough.

00:10:52,544 --> 00:10:55,814
Whatever.

00:10:55,881 --> 00:10:59,318
I just go where I'm told.

00:10:59,384 --> 00:11:01,553
WOMAN:
Let me in,
I am his mother.

00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,490
I know, baby, I know.

00:11:05,557 --> 00:11:06,658
This is really hard.

00:11:06,725 --> 00:11:09,394
It's okay
to be upset, okay.

00:11:12,598 --> 00:11:13,532
What's on your finger...

00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:17,102
Did you fingerprint my son?

00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:19,771
We fingerprinted everyone in
the house, DNA samples as well.

00:11:19,838 --> 00:11:21,206
Is he a suspect?

00:11:21,273 --> 00:11:23,742
He didn't refuse
and Mrs. Delancy was here.

00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:27,245
Sleeping with his father does
not make her his mother, okay.

00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,246
I'm his mother.

00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,848
Where were you this afternoon?

00:11:29,915 --> 00:11:31,383
I was taking a walk.

00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,085
Can anyone confirm that?

00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,387
No.

00:11:35,454 --> 00:11:36,555
Come on.

00:11:36,622 --> 00:11:38,223
Let's go.

00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:03,682
(camera shutter clicking)

00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,762
(drawer sliding)

00:12:30,976 --> 00:12:33,111
(beeping)

00:12:36,915 --> 00:12:39,451
(device purring softly)

00:12:52,364 --> 00:12:55,701
(objects rattling)

00:13:12,818 --> 00:13:17,623
Bleach was used in this kitchen
but not to clean up the blood.

00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:21,360
So the aging rocker
bit it in the kitchen

00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,429
with the marble
rolling pin?

00:13:37,976 --> 00:13:41,246
If only the who
was as easy as the how.

00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,389
(inhales deeply)

00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,463
Oh, hey. You got to
be pulling a double

00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,964
if you're in my lab
at this hour.

00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,066
Yeah.

00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:28,600
What's up?
You need a hand?

00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,336
No. Thanks.

00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,507
Oh. ABA card.

00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:36,610
It's negative for semen.

00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:38,512
I said I didn't
need your help.

00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:46,654
Oh, thank you,

00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:49,523
but there's no drinking or
eating allowed in the lab.

00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,725
It's a urine sample.

00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:51,992
My bad.

00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,728
Get it to Tox.

00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:56,364
And... check this
for spermicide.

00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,066
Call me with the results.

00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:01,736
Did you run out of proper swabs?

00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:02,903
Just do it.

00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,805
What's the case number?

00:15:04,872 --> 00:15:06,907
Consider this
a proficiency exam.

00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:10,578
Muggs?

00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:14,715
Sam. What are you doing here?

00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:16,017
Just wanted to
see your face,

00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,752
and I missed you at
the implosion party.

00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:19,520
Oh, yeah.

00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:20,654
I heard about
that, um...

00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:22,490
I'm sorry I missed that.

00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:24,592
When's Lily get back
from her cruise?

00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:26,594
Monday.

00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,162
How about
a family dinner?

00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:30,297
Uh, yeah, I'll call you
when she's had a chance

00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:31,565
to catch her breath.

00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:34,068
You know you don't always
need a reason to call me.

00:15:34,135 --> 00:15:35,436
I know you're busy.

00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:37,204
I'll see you later.

00:15:39,073 --> 00:15:44,278

Now... what is that?

00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:51,379
The key to our mystery?

00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:52,513
(chuckles)

00:17:08,262 --> 00:17:10,131
(door closes)

00:17:27,782 --> 00:17:31,786
(machinery whirring)

00:17:49,893 --> 00:17:51,161
WILLOWS:
<i>Excuse me.</i>

00:17:51,228 --> 00:17:53,064
What can I do you for?

00:17:53,064 --> 00:17:54,398
You were working last night.

00:17:54,465 --> 00:17:56,400
Always. I own the place.

00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:57,668
Do you remember me?

00:17:57,735 --> 00:18:00,605
I was... I was here.

00:18:00,671 --> 00:18:02,774
Was a busy night, I'm sorry.

00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,942
(sighs)

00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:06,878
Well... do you have

00:18:06,944 --> 00:18:08,679
any surveillance cameras
in the place?

00:18:08,746 --> 00:18:10,114
What's this about?

00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:15,520
I'm with the Crime Lab.

00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,589
Yeah, that's the only one.

00:18:18,656 --> 00:18:21,058
Just gets
the cash register.

00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,161
So you've got nothing
that covers the customers

00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,696
or the dance floor, or...?

00:18:25,763 --> 00:18:26,931
No need to.

00:18:26,998 --> 00:18:28,866
(scoffs)

00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:57,295
♪ ♪

00:19:08,906 --> 00:19:11,309
Find something?

00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,910
No.

00:19:12,977 --> 00:19:15,346
No prints, no hairs, no fibers.

00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:17,248
Materials are common

00:19:17,315 --> 00:19:20,384
hobby shop issue, but the blood

00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,320
matches the victim's.

00:19:22,386 --> 00:19:24,322
Are you interested in motive?

00:19:24,388 --> 00:19:26,190
Sofia just spent
the last two hours

00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:28,960
with the sheriff,
the head of the Olympia Casino,

00:19:29,026 --> 00:19:30,428
and a couple of dozen lawyers.

00:19:30,495 --> 00:19:34,432
Apparently, Izzy Delancy owned
the rights to his own songs.

00:19:34,499 --> 00:19:36,634
The Olympia was negotiating
to purchase them

00:19:36,701 --> 00:19:38,436
for a medley show
based on his music.

00:19:38,503 --> 00:19:40,571
Izzy never got a chance
to sign the contracts.

00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:44,809
Dead rock star, nut job family,

00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:47,411
and a company hungry
for the next <i>Mamma Mia!</i>

00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:48,980
Who inherits the music rights?

00:19:49,046 --> 00:19:50,414
The son, Sven,

00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,416
but he's a minor, so the rights

00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,685
would be controlled
by his mother, Dusty.

00:19:54,752 --> 00:19:56,621
It's illegal to benefit
from a criminal act.

00:19:56,687 --> 00:19:59,290
If either one of them
committed the murder...

00:19:59,357 --> 00:20:02,026
Then the rights would go to
Izzy's current wife, Madeline.

00:20:02,093 --> 00:20:05,363
Well, that's motive for her.

00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,598
But how does
this fit in?

00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,600
ECKLIE (sighs):
Maybe we should release it

00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:10,935
to the media.

00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,236
Someone might have
unwittingly

00:20:12,303 --> 00:20:13,738
made a component
of the miniature.

00:20:13,805 --> 00:20:17,708
If they came forward,
that could help us.

00:20:17,775 --> 00:20:19,877
What's the point of gratifying
the murderer with publicity?

00:20:19,944 --> 00:20:22,113
Izzy Delancy is famous;
the press wants answers.

00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,248
Don't we all?

00:20:24,315 --> 00:20:26,150
Sara, this is your case, too--
what do you think?

00:20:26,217 --> 00:20:30,922
I, uh... I agree with Grissom.

00:20:31,956 --> 00:20:33,724
Of course you do.

00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:42,133
I looked into the key
that Izzy swallowed.

00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,901
Turns out that Bumblebee
is a safe company.

00:20:43,968 --> 00:20:45,236
Sofia asked Madeline about it.

00:20:45,303 --> 00:20:47,738
She says she knew that there
was a safe in the house

00:20:47,805 --> 00:20:49,807
but didn't know where it was--
my kind of marriage.

00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,476
So the key could've been
in his system

00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,177
anywhere from a few minutes
to several days?

00:20:53,244 --> 00:20:56,714
Right. So if robbery was
the motive for murder

00:20:56,781 --> 00:20:59,317
and Izzy swallowed the key
to keep something hidden,

00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:03,020
maybe whatever is in that
safe will lead us to who.

00:21:35,219 --> 00:21:38,089
(sighs)

00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:46,197
(click)

00:22:06,551 --> 00:22:08,553
(camera shutter clicking)

00:22:14,892 --> 00:22:17,695
(gasps lightly)

00:23:01,472 --> 00:23:03,274
You're late.

00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:05,243
(sighs):
I did the best I could, Lindsey.

00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:06,744
You said you would
watch the rehearsal.

00:23:06,811 --> 00:23:09,614
Work just...
really got out of hand.

00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,083
Surprise.

00:23:19,056 --> 00:23:20,391
(sighs)

00:23:22,393 --> 00:23:23,361
(sighs)

00:23:23,428 --> 00:23:24,962
Lindsey.

00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,197
I really am sorry.

00:23:26,264 --> 00:23:28,533
I hate it when work
gets in the way.

00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:30,334
I love to watch you dance.

00:23:32,055 --> 00:23:34,825
Fine. Whatever.

00:23:37,718 --> 00:23:39,249
I got a solo.

00:23:39,249 --> 00:23:41,117
You did?

00:23:41,184 --> 00:23:42,352
That's so great!

00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:43,653
It's <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,487
Fanta...

00:23:44,554 --> 00:23:46,322
(Willows grunts)

00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:52,195
(groans)

00:23:57,801 --> 00:24:00,203
Is my daughter okay?

00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,176
Lindsey!

00:24:06,242 --> 00:24:08,278
Lindsey!

00:24:10,413 --> 00:24:11,981
Lindsey...!

00:24:20,136 --> 00:24:21,848
WILLOWS:
I don't need that. I'm fine.

00:24:21,915 --> 00:24:23,640
Ma'am, you need to put this
on, for your own safety.

00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:24,724
You suffered
a head trauma.

00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:26,092
There could be serious
delayed problems.

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,061
I'm refusing treatment.
Just give me the release form.

00:24:28,128 --> 00:24:29,729
Ma'am, I strongly recommend
you put this on...

00:24:29,796 --> 00:24:31,631
Just give me the damn form!
Hey, hey, hey.

00:24:31,698 --> 00:24:32,632
Catherine.
They got Lindsey.

00:24:32,699 --> 00:24:33,967
I know.
They took Lindsey.

00:24:34,033 --> 00:24:35,969
It's all over
the radio, I heard.
It was an SUV.

00:24:36,035 --> 00:24:38,204
And it was
silver or brown.
We're gonna
get Lindsey back, okay?

00:24:38,271 --> 00:24:40,006
And they drove
that direction.

00:24:40,073 --> 00:24:41,541
I never saw it coming.
Okay.

00:24:41,608 --> 00:24:42,642
They came from
this direction.

00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:44,778
Slow down,
slow down.

00:24:50,483 --> 00:24:52,719
(tires squealing)

00:24:52,786 --> 00:24:55,622
These are acceleration marks.

00:24:55,688 --> 00:24:56,790
They were waiting for us.

00:24:58,324 --> 00:25:00,927
I should've told you, but
I didn't want a sermon.

00:25:00,994 --> 00:25:02,228
I did my own rape kit.

00:25:02,295 --> 00:25:03,563
Came back negative.

00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,131
Thank God.

00:25:05,198 --> 00:25:06,966
These events
have to be connected.

00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:10,136
We'll check your old cases
for possible suspects.

00:25:10,203 --> 00:25:12,806
I'll ask Ecklie if he can kick
in some help from day shift.

00:25:12,872 --> 00:25:14,107
I appreciate that.

00:25:14,174 --> 00:25:16,676
You've got to stay at
arm's length, Catherine.

00:25:16,743 --> 00:25:18,745
I-I know.

00:25:26,753 --> 00:25:28,555
Nothing but partials.

00:25:28,621 --> 00:25:30,590
That's impossible.

00:25:30,657 --> 00:25:32,725
I ran the VIN number
on the Cougar that hit you.

00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:36,062
A place sold it
yesterday for cash.

00:25:36,129 --> 00:25:38,364
Catherine, I'm really sorry
for leaving you there.

00:25:38,431 --> 00:25:39,666
Don't go there, Nick.

00:25:39,732 --> 00:25:41,734
They were gonna get to me,
one way or another.

00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:43,770
It had to have been
at least two guys--

00:25:43,837 --> 00:25:47,307
one who was driving the Cougar,
and the other in the SUV.

00:25:47,373 --> 00:25:49,109
(groaning)

00:25:51,978 --> 00:25:54,280
He reached through the window.

00:25:54,347 --> 00:25:55,582
Print the inside of that handle.

00:25:55,648 --> 00:25:58,351
Okay.

00:25:58,418 --> 00:26:00,153
Sam?

00:26:02,155 --> 00:26:04,390
It just happened.
Who told you?

00:26:06,392 --> 00:26:07,660
Well, I can't talk right now.

00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:09,729
I'll let you know
when we find something out.

00:26:16,436 --> 00:26:18,438
Sure, Sam.

00:26:25,211 --> 00:26:26,746
Sam!

00:26:28,748 --> 00:26:31,050
What do you know about
what happened to Lindsey?

00:26:31,117 --> 00:26:32,318
What do you know about it?

00:26:32,385 --> 00:26:34,187
Who's using us
to get to you?

00:26:34,254 --> 00:26:36,356
This is your granddaughter
we're talking about.

00:26:36,423 --> 00:26:37,657
What the hell
do you know?

00:26:43,062 --> 00:26:46,533
Front desk found this
in the quick checkout bin.

00:26:49,102 --> 00:26:50,703
"Can you guess what
you're going to give me?"

00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,005
What does that mean?
Who's behind this?

00:26:52,071 --> 00:26:54,407
I don't know.

00:26:54,474 --> 00:26:56,609
This was just found.

00:26:56,676 --> 00:26:58,678
Same place.

00:27:04,284 --> 00:27:05,752
Where is she?

00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:07,320
Who has her?

00:27:07,387 --> 00:27:09,722
I swear, I don't know.

00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:10,757
Like hell!

00:27:10,824 --> 00:27:13,226
I blame you!
I blame you for this!

00:27:13,293 --> 00:27:15,235
I never wanted to involve you
personally or professionally

00:27:15,235 --> 00:27:16,303
in any
of my business.

00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,505
Business?
You don't have a business.

00:27:18,572 --> 00:27:20,641
You're a thug
in thousand dollar shoes!

00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:32,052
Thanks for not
disappointing me, Sam.

00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:45,866
Okay, but could you
take a break

00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:48,035
or get a cup of tea
or something here?

00:27:48,102 --> 00:27:49,803
Think I got something.
What?

00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,139
Mandy ran the print that
I picked up from your car,

00:27:52,206 --> 00:27:54,975
and it's a match to
an open burglary case,

00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:56,043
from a few months ago.

00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,344
I think it was yours, Warrick.

00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:00,514
I got it.

00:28:00,581 --> 00:28:04,551
Oh, this is from this couple
from San Francisco.

00:28:04,618 --> 00:28:06,887
Bought a second home
in Seven Hills,

00:28:06,954 --> 00:28:09,089
came back and found it tossed.

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,694
The chair.

00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:18,232
Look at that.

00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:19,933
The chair.

00:28:24,977 --> 00:28:26,917
Las Vegas police you're under arrest. 

00:28:30,396 --> 00:28:31,364
Gun! Gun!

00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,365
(gunshots)

00:28:40,106 --> 00:28:40,840
Call a paramedic!

00:28:40,906 --> 00:28:42,375
Lindsey!

00:28:42,441 --> 00:28:43,876
Lindsey!
Mom!

00:28:43,943 --> 00:28:45,811
Where are you,
Lindsey?!
(muffled screaming)

00:28:45,878 --> 00:28:48,080
Lindsey! Lindsey!

00:28:48,147 --> 00:28:49,949
Lindsey!
Catherine!

00:28:50,016 --> 00:28:51,384
Don't touch her.

00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,718
If you want a conviction,

00:28:52,785 --> 00:28:54,854
you have to let me
do this, all right?

00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,223
Let me do it,
all right?

00:28:57,289 --> 00:28:58,657
All right.

00:28:58,724 --> 00:28:59,692
WILLOWS:
I'm right here, Lindsey.

00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:01,193
Right here.

00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,328
I'm right here.

00:29:02,395 --> 00:29:04,964
(muffled cries)

00:29:05,031 --> 00:29:06,265
I'm right here.

00:29:06,332 --> 00:29:08,501
I'm right here.
I'm right here.

00:29:08,567 --> 00:29:10,703
(muffled cries)

00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,339
(sobbing)

00:29:13,406 --> 00:29:14,607
Deep breaths.

00:29:14,673 --> 00:29:15,941
(breathes deeply)

00:29:16,008 --> 00:29:17,576
Breathe easy.

00:29:17,643 --> 00:29:19,445
Deep breaths.

00:29:19,512 --> 00:29:22,415
Almost. Almost.

00:29:22,481 --> 00:29:24,283
Okay. It's okay.

00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,551
I got you.

00:29:25,618 --> 00:29:27,620
I got you. Everything's okay.

00:29:27,687 --> 00:29:29,855
(sobbing):
Mom.

00:29:29,922 --> 00:29:30,890
It's okay.

00:29:30,956 --> 00:29:32,024
It's okay, baby.

00:29:32,091 --> 00:29:33,025
It's okay.

00:29:33,092 --> 00:29:34,827
Everything's okay.

00:29:36,829 --> 00:29:38,964
(sobbing):
Mom.

00:29:39,031 --> 00:29:40,633
I got you.

00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,101
Everything's okay.

00:29:42,168 --> 00:29:43,269
It's okay.

00:29:59,356 --> 00:30:00,791
How's Lindsey?

00:30:00,857 --> 00:30:02,759
(sighs)

00:30:02,826 --> 00:30:04,261
She says she's fine.

00:30:04,328 --> 00:30:07,431
The doctor is
assessing her now.

00:30:07,497 --> 00:30:10,200
We still don't
have an ID.

00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:13,804
Prints put him
in the motel.

00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:22,713
Can you place
him at the bar?

00:30:31,355 --> 00:30:33,256
Yeah.

00:30:33,323 --> 00:30:34,891
Yeah, he was there.

00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,126
The accident was a two-man job.

00:30:36,193 --> 00:30:37,728
Can you remember anybody else?

00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:52,943
I can't get a face.

00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,112
SIDLE:
Greg found the mother lode.

00:30:55,178 --> 00:30:56,613
The Nanny saved
all of her e-mails

00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,881
on her computer.

00:30:57,948 --> 00:31:01,318
She was sending private
Delancy family photos

00:31:01,385 --> 00:31:03,120
to an editor
at <i>Scandal Pages</i> magazine.

00:31:03,186 --> 00:31:05,555
Based on a sliding
scale of salaciousness,

00:31:05,622 --> 00:31:08,392
<i>Scandal Pages</i> was
depositing money

00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:10,594
into Annie's PayPal account.

00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:13,430
So I have the DNA combo
from Sven's bed sheets,

00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,499
and none of it was
actually Sven's.

00:31:22,906 --> 00:31:24,141
Whoa.

00:31:28,045 --> 00:31:30,614
CURTIS:
Annie Lansfield,

00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:34,685
Cornstalk Queen of
Tidioute, Pennsylvania.

00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:37,521
You move to Vegas
to become famous

00:31:37,587 --> 00:31:41,324
and ended up
doing diaper duty

00:31:41,324 --> 00:31:44,361
for a washed-up
rock star.

00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:46,563
Do you want to tell me
how you ended up

00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,899
in a safe that even his wife
didn't know about?

00:31:48,966 --> 00:31:51,535
I clean for extra cash.

00:31:51,602 --> 00:31:52,970
I know the house
better than anyone.

00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,405
I knew where
the safe was.

00:31:54,471 --> 00:31:57,641
I just didn't have
a key, until...

00:31:57,708 --> 00:32:01,678
Honey, I need some money
to buy clothes for Emma.

00:32:01,745 --> 00:32:03,380
I just gave you
money for that.

00:32:03,447 --> 00:32:04,615
She's a baby.

00:32:04,681 --> 00:32:05,749
She grows.

00:32:05,816 --> 00:32:07,451
You know, this wouldn't
even be an issue

00:32:07,518 --> 00:32:09,153
if you would sign
those damn contracts.

00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,287
Really?

00:32:10,354 --> 00:32:12,523
Well, that is between
me and my music.

00:32:12,589 --> 00:32:13,557
And you,

00:32:13,624 --> 00:32:16,460
you will never
see this safe.

00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:23,400
(laughing
maniacally)

00:32:23,467 --> 00:32:24,601
Gold digger!

00:32:24,668 --> 00:32:25,602
Dig for that!

00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:27,237
(chuckling)

00:32:27,304 --> 00:32:30,240
The E.R. doctor said it would
pass in a couple of days.

00:32:30,307 --> 00:32:32,076
They gave us
a copy of the X-ray

00:32:32,142 --> 00:32:34,111
to keep on file
with the general physician.

00:32:34,178 --> 00:32:37,247
It had the perfect outline
of the key.

00:32:37,314 --> 00:32:39,049
So, I took the X-ray
to a key shop,

00:32:39,116 --> 00:32:40,250
told them my kid swallowed it.

00:32:40,317 --> 00:32:42,019
Resourceful.

00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:43,487
But I put everything back.

00:32:43,554 --> 00:32:47,157
After making <i>Scandal Pages</i>
money off it.

00:32:47,224 --> 00:32:48,225
Look, a few years ago,

00:32:48,292 --> 00:32:49,727
Izzy went on this
big health kick--

00:32:49,793 --> 00:32:51,729
vegetarian, blah, blah.

00:32:51,795 --> 00:32:54,064
He claimed that
all those chicken heads

00:32:54,131 --> 00:32:56,433
that he bit on stage were fake.

00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,969
When I found them,
I was just so excited.

00:32:59,036 --> 00:33:00,637
Do you know how much
<i>Scandal Pages</i> pays

00:33:00,704 --> 00:33:02,306
for an urban
legend story?

00:33:02,372 --> 00:33:03,640
A lot.

00:33:03,707 --> 00:33:05,042
Here's a scandal:

00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:06,877
we got evidence

00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:10,647
of sex between you and
Izzy Delancy in Sven's bed.

00:33:10,714 --> 00:33:13,884
Or how about this:
if you killed him,

00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:17,321
you'd be the first to crack open
that whole story.

00:33:17,388 --> 00:33:20,391
Exclusive pics,
the whole deal.

00:33:22,426 --> 00:33:25,295
It took 911 a while to come.

00:33:25,362 --> 00:33:27,398
I just got a quick pic.

00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:30,768
You said it-- I'm resourceful,
not a murderer.

00:33:32,403 --> 00:33:34,371
I didn't do it.

00:33:40,577 --> 00:33:44,348
NARRATOR:
It seemed more
like a fairy tale.

00:33:44,415 --> 00:33:46,884
Hard living rocker,
Izzy Delancy met Dusty DeCosta.

00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,520
They fell in love.
He wrote a hit song about her.

00:33:49,586 --> 00:33:55,192
She was to become his first
wife... or was she?

00:33:55,259 --> 00:33:57,261
Where did you find this?

00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:58,729
Oh, I dug deep.

00:33:58,796 --> 00:34:00,731
In a potentially
shocking display

00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:02,166
of distrust and business acumen,

00:34:02,232 --> 00:34:04,535
Izzy Delancy, after ten years
of dating Dusty DeCosta,

00:34:04,601 --> 00:34:06,070
finally wed her in a beautiful,

00:34:06,136 --> 00:34:07,371
flower-filled ceremony
in Malaysia.

00:34:07,438 --> 00:34:09,706
The ceremony was everything
a girl could hope for--

00:34:09,773 --> 00:34:11,608
beautiful, romantic,
well-attended.

00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:14,244
The only thing it wasn't?
Legal.

00:34:14,311 --> 00:34:17,347
Much to Dusty's surprise, years
later, after filing for divorce

00:34:17,414 --> 00:34:21,385
and custody of their then
eight-year-old son, Sven,

00:34:21,452 --> 00:34:23,387
she was shocked to discover
that the Malaysian Shaman

00:34:23,454 --> 00:34:25,923
was not recognized by the United
States as an officiant.

00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:27,091
Izzy has never released

00:34:27,157 --> 00:34:29,560
an official statement
on the subject...

00:34:29,626 --> 00:34:31,228
Sounds like motive to me.

00:34:32,396 --> 00:34:33,630
Oh. Hi.

00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:34,932
Listen, you're going to have
to follow me

00:34:34,998 --> 00:34:37,301
'cause I'm late for a client.

00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:38,869
What is it you want?

00:34:38,936 --> 00:34:40,537
We were wondering

00:34:40,604 --> 00:34:42,673
if you could tell us about
your relationship with Izzy?

00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,475
Oh, God.

00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,643
So I'm a suspect now?

00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,212
That's precious.

00:34:48,278 --> 00:34:52,416
Okay. The man makes a mint off
of singing about our sex life,

00:34:52,483 --> 00:34:54,885
barely offers a
relationship to our son,

00:34:54,952 --> 00:34:56,887
kicks me out of a house
we built together,

00:34:56,954 --> 00:34:59,289
leaves me with nothing, and now
you want to put me in jail?

00:34:59,356 --> 00:35:01,091
Rich. Really rich.

00:35:01,158 --> 00:35:03,293
Izzy was a smart
business man.

00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,229
He owned all the rights
to his music.

00:35:05,295 --> 00:35:06,663
What does that matter to me?

00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,632
Do I get royalty checks
for being his muse.

00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:09,900
(chuckles)
SIDLE:
Exactly.

00:35:09,967 --> 00:35:12,736
But with Izzy dead,
the rights go to Sven.

00:35:12,803 --> 00:35:14,338
Ostensibly you.

00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:16,774
And you still don't an alibi for
the afternoon of Izzy's death.

00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,842
I do,

00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:22,246
it's just embarrassing to me.

00:35:22,312 --> 00:35:24,982
The "new" Mrs. Delancy
called a meeting.

00:35:25,048 --> 00:35:27,284
She tells me about
the Olympia offer,

00:35:27,351 --> 00:35:29,853
Izzy's being difficult
about the deal,

00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,690
so would I talk to him
because he listens to me still.

00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,025
(scoffs)

00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:36,860
Had he started sleeping
with the nanny yet?

00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,595
Yeah.

00:35:38,662 --> 00:35:40,597
Did Madeline tell you
that was her old job?

00:35:40,664 --> 00:35:42,866
No.
No.

00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:45,803
Look, I'd like to pin it on her,
I really would, but I can't

00:35:45,869 --> 00:35:49,339
because I was with her at the
Espresso Drop all afternoon.

00:35:49,406 --> 00:35:51,975
I really have to go.

00:35:52,042 --> 00:35:54,478
What are those
drawings on the table?

00:35:54,545 --> 00:35:58,182
Oh, those are Sven's.

00:35:58,248 --> 00:36:01,018
(giggles)

00:36:01,085 --> 00:36:02,586
Some mothers
get sport trophies,

00:36:02,653 --> 00:36:04,621
I get perfectly rendered
skyscrapers.

00:36:04,688 --> 00:36:06,323
He wants to be an urban planner.

00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,560
He's kind of
obsessed with models.

00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:12,229
You guys let
yourself out, okay?

00:36:28,045 --> 00:36:32,516
If Sven is capable of creating
these kind of 3-D renderings,

00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:35,552
he definitely could've
built that Miniature.

00:36:35,619 --> 00:36:37,855
Son defending the honor
of his mother?

00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:39,857
Name that Greek tragedy.

00:36:39,923 --> 00:36:42,760
Yes, I'm angry with my father

00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:44,928
for the way
he treated my mother.

00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:50,701
I'm angry with my father
for sleeping with Annie.

00:36:50,768 --> 00:36:55,372
I'm angry with my father
for naming me Sven.

00:36:55,439 --> 00:37:03,313
But I've been in therapy
twice a week since I was six.

00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:08,152
I'm tired of adults
asking me if I'm angry.

00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:12,656
Besides, I'm...

00:37:12,723 --> 00:37:15,526
I'm not the only one
who's pissed at my dad.

00:37:15,592 --> 00:37:19,329
Right, but your mom
and Madeline are covered.

00:37:19,396 --> 00:37:24,301
They were together at the time
of your father's death.

00:37:28,772 --> 00:37:33,143
(over intercom):
So maybe you were so angry
with your father,

00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,411
that you channeled your anger

00:37:34,478 --> 00:37:36,313
and used your skills
as a model builder

00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,416
to build this.

00:37:41,785 --> 00:37:43,487
And a nice...

00:37:43,554 --> 00:37:46,356
heavy object to do this.

00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:07,010
I always faint
at the sight of blood.

00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:11,582
If that's the case, he probably
did not commit the murder

00:38:11,648 --> 00:38:13,951
and he certainly
didn't paint the Miniature

00:38:14,017 --> 00:38:15,519
with his father's blood.

00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:18,555
And there's a test we can do
to prove it.

00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,425
GRISSOM:
We're using a tilt table

00:38:21,492 --> 00:38:23,727
and we're injecting him
with isoproterenol.

00:38:23,794 --> 00:38:26,964
We're testing his sensitivity
to his vagus nerve.

00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,699
Basically,
we're looking to find out

00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:30,701
if the nerves that control
his blood pressure

00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:32,669
are predisposed
to short circuit

00:38:32,736 --> 00:38:35,072
when he gets
an adrenaline rush.

00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:41,602
You're telling me that this
could keep him out of jail?

00:38:41,602 --> 00:38:43,343
Unless he was faking it.

00:38:47,017 --> 00:38:48,819
(sighs)

00:39:22,286 --> 00:39:24,288
♪ ♪

00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:30,427
(knocks softly)

00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,831
I hear we're out of suspects.

00:39:33,897 --> 00:39:35,265
Not necessarily.

00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:37,768
Could be anybody in town.

00:39:37,835 --> 00:39:39,937
Or anybody out of town
for that matter.

00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,905
That's a lot
of suspects.

00:39:41,972 --> 00:39:44,308
What do you want us to do?

00:39:45,609 --> 00:39:48,145
I don't know.

00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,249
I'll deal with it.

00:39:57,621 --> 00:39:59,523
I ran DNA on the guy
who was holding Lindsey.

00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,824
Did you get a name?

00:40:00,891 --> 00:40:02,526
Um, kind of.
See, this guy has markers

00:40:02,593 --> 00:40:04,328
that are found in, like,
ten percent of the population

00:40:04,395 --> 00:40:06,163
which reminded me
of some other results

00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,432
that I'd been processing
recently.

00:40:08,499 --> 00:40:11,735
13 alleles in common
with Robert O'Brien?

00:40:11,802 --> 00:40:16,106
The suicide from Sam Braun's
implosion party.

00:40:19,276 --> 00:40:22,780
The guy who grabbed Lindsey
is Robert O'Brien's brother?

00:40:22,846 --> 00:40:24,648
Right.
So when that came up,

00:40:24,715 --> 00:40:26,784
I ran all the other exemplars
from the O'Brien case,

00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,385
and I got a hit
on a piece of hair

00:40:28,452 --> 00:40:30,154
from the duct tape
that they used to bind Lindsey.

00:40:32,489 --> 00:40:34,491
Joe Hirschoff.

00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:37,628
O'Brien's partner.

00:40:41,065 --> 00:40:43,734
WILLOWS:
Hi, Sam.
(chuckles)

00:40:43,801 --> 00:40:47,104
Everybody in town
knows you're here
every Thursday night.

00:40:47,171 --> 00:40:49,239
And usually
with my mother.

00:40:49,306 --> 00:40:51,675
I'll be right along.

00:40:51,742 --> 00:40:53,811
She doesn't mean a thing.

00:40:53,877 --> 00:40:55,646
It's all show.

00:40:55,712 --> 00:40:59,083
Look, Muggs,
yesterday was...

00:40:59,149 --> 00:41:00,350
Just save it.

00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:03,320
I only came here to tell you
to call off your guys.

00:41:03,387 --> 00:41:05,089
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:41:05,155 --> 00:41:06,590
Joe Hirschoff and his partner

00:41:06,657 --> 00:41:09,126
invested everything they had
in The Eclipse.

00:41:09,193 --> 00:41:11,228
But it went bankrupt
before you broke ground.

00:41:11,295 --> 00:41:13,997
You formed a new corporation
to finish the project,

00:41:14,064 --> 00:41:16,133
leaving those guys
with nothing.

00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,001
Sometimes that's the way it goes
in business.

00:41:18,068 --> 00:41:19,436
Uh-huh.

00:41:19,503 --> 00:41:22,740
O'Brien and Hirschoff
lost $20 million, right?

00:41:22,806 --> 00:41:26,276
O'Brien caved
and stuck a gun in his mouth.

00:41:26,343 --> 00:41:28,145
Hirschoff wants you
to pay him back.

00:41:28,212 --> 00:41:30,848
So, where is he?

00:41:32,549 --> 00:41:34,585
Come on, Sam, this isn't
Old Vegas anymore.

00:41:34,651 --> 00:41:36,920
Let the police handle it.

00:41:36,987 --> 00:41:39,189
Or have you
already killed him?

00:41:39,256 --> 00:41:40,624
(chuckles)

00:41:40,691 --> 00:41:43,192
I give you my word, no.

00:41:53,492 --> 00:41:58,073
(no audio)
