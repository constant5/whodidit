00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:48,092
The vic had nothing on him
but his casino I.D.

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,794
Name is Vasco Ruiz.

00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:53,431
He's a dishwasher here
at the Golden Sapphire.

00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:56,768
Yeah, I guess he
got off his shift,

00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:58,970
went to his car,
got whacked.

00:01:59,037 --> 00:02:00,271
By what?

00:02:00,338 --> 00:02:01,906
A blender?

00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:05,877
Surveillance?

00:02:05,943 --> 00:02:07,879
Not in the employee

00:02:07,945 --> 00:02:08,980
Witnesses?

00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:10,248
Well, we found a
Wayne Newton impersonator,

00:02:10,314 --> 00:02:12,083
but all I could get
him to do was sing

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,151
a few bars of
"Danke Sheon".

00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:14,952
But no wallet

00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:17,055
no cash,
no cell phone,

00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,081
no car keys.

00:02:19,148 --> 00:02:20,683
Smells like a robbery.

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,852
Maybe it was his payday.

00:02:22,918 --> 00:02:24,820
Even if this guy
was walking out of here

00:02:24,887 --> 00:02:26,122
with a million dollars...

00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,590
this is way more than excessive.

00:02:27,657 --> 00:02:28,924
Personal.

00:02:28,991 --> 00:02:30,393
Yeah, I'm gonna
go get personal

00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:31,761

00:02:31,827 --> 00:02:33,796

She's not talking.

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,774
What about ID?

00:05:11,841 --> 00:05:13,009
He must've taken
her wallet.

Cell phone?

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,278
It's not here,
they took it.

00:05:15,345 --> 00:05:18,281
Somebody had
to see something.

00:05:18,348 --> 00:05:19,916
Hey.
Hi.

00:05:19,983 --> 00:05:22,785
Well, we got a souvenir cup

00:05:22,852 --> 00:05:24,554
that screams "tourist."

00:05:24,621 --> 00:05:26,689
Yep.

00:05:26,756 --> 00:05:28,057
I don't see a bar
anywhere around here.

00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:29,425
She must've been
either going to

00:05:29,492 --> 00:05:30,793
or coming from the Strip.

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,197
But she shouldn't have been
walking around here, Warrick.

00:05:34,264 --> 00:05:36,533
Couldn't pick a shadier
part of town, man.

00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:38,401
You know these tourists
don't know what they're getting

00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:42,005
when they book
a trip to Vegas online.

00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:44,874
They think "I got a room
on the Strip for 75 bucks.

00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:46,910
Whoo, what a deal."

00:05:46,976 --> 00:05:48,244
Then they mosey through
the naked city

00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:49,379
with their thousand
dollar cameras.

00:05:49,445 --> 00:05:51,281
Next thing you know,

00:05:51,347 --> 00:05:53,283
we're taking their picture.

00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:55,485
You know what,
Grissom's crime scene

00:05:55,552 --> 00:05:57,587
is just five blocks from here.

00:05:57,654 --> 00:06:00,723
Both victims had their wallets
and their cell phones stolen.

00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,893
And they were both beaten
down in the same way.

00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,629
Looks like someone's
on a little crime spree.

00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:17,574
Uh, David, hang on.

00:06:24,814 --> 00:06:26,950
Looks like a woman's toenail.

00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:30,019
Well, it's not necessarily
a woman's.

00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:42,198
(camera clicks)

00:07:00,383 --> 00:07:02,385
Jessica...

00:07:02,452 --> 00:07:04,354
this might hurt a little bit,

00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,222
but it's going to
help us get the people

00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:07,490
who did this to you.

00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:09,492

00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:11,161
I'm sorry.

00:07:11,227 --> 00:07:13,096
Thank you.

00:07:19,068 --> 00:07:21,204
Do you have any other injuries?

00:07:21,271 --> 00:07:24,073
Yeah. On my left side.

00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,241
Ow.

00:07:25,308 --> 00:07:27,844
(groans)

00:07:29,445 --> 00:07:33,583

for me, please?

(crying)

00:07:41,024 --> 00:07:43,660
Thank you.

00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:49,399
I just got out of
a ten-year relationship.

00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:52,802
So I decided to take
a solo trip to Vegas.

00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:54,704
You know, try the whole

00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:57,774
"what happens in Vegas,
stays in Vegas."

00:07:57,841 --> 00:07:59,042
Been there.

00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:02,946
Yeah, well, I get to take
this face back with me.

00:08:03,012 --> 00:08:04,914
(crying)

00:08:06,683 --> 00:08:09,986
Well, did anybody
else get hurt?

00:08:10,053 --> 00:08:11,221
Why do you ask?

00:08:11,287 --> 00:08:15,525
I heard them say
that I was number two.

00:08:15,592 --> 00:08:18,461
Was there a number one?

00:08:18,528 --> 00:08:19,796
There was.

00:08:19,863 --> 00:08:21,498
How are they doing?

00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:24,834
He died.

Now what's with the suit?

00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:04,767
Today was my first
jury trial.

00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:09,472
Today ended
an hour and a half ago.

00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:12,074

don't want the day to end.

00:09:12,141 --> 00:09:13,109

00:09:13,176 --> 00:09:14,744

00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,782

00:09:22,952 --> 00:09:25,288
How'd you do on the stand?

So good the prosecutor
took me to dinner.

00:09:27,824 --> 00:09:29,459
Female?

00:09:29,525 --> 00:09:30,827
Yeah, she was icing.

00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:32,528
I was just happy
to finally

00:09:32,595 --> 00:09:34,530
see a case from the crime
scene to the courtroom.

00:09:34,597 --> 00:09:36,466
We freakin' buried
the guy.

00:09:36,532 --> 00:09:39,535
It was bad ass.

00:09:39,602 --> 00:09:42,505
I dropped the hammer...

00:09:42,572 --> 00:09:44,841
he was squirming
in his chair.

00:09:44,907 --> 00:09:47,410
How many different patterns
you have there?

00:09:49,445 --> 00:09:52,482
Five different patterns.

00:09:52,548 --> 00:09:56,185
Well, I've got three different
ones on the T-shirt.

00:09:56,252 --> 00:09:58,154
I mean, this one that looks like

00:09:58,221 --> 00:09:59,956
an athletic shoe
sure got around.

00:10:00,022 --> 00:10:03,392
As did this pointed toe
high-heeled one.

00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:05,161
Check out the heel mark.

00:10:05,228 --> 00:10:07,396
So did this work boot.

00:10:07,463 --> 00:10:09,832
What do you know about
work boots?

00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:10,867
I'm guessing
you haven't worked

00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:12,535
a day of hard labor
in your life.

00:10:12,602 --> 00:10:14,270
I wore Doc Martens
in high school.

00:10:14,337 --> 00:10:15,304
It was the style.

00:10:15,371 --> 00:10:16,973
Yeah, for skinheads.

00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:19,442
Yeah, they kind of
ruined it for everyone.

00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,813
You know, one of the
victims was Hispanic,

00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,081
the other was Jewish.

00:10:25,148 --> 00:10:27,750
Maybe this was a hate crime.

00:10:30,219 --> 00:10:33,089
Sure looks like hate to me.

00:10:33,156 --> 00:10:34,824
Vasco Ruiz was someone's
punching bag.

00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:37,827
He suffered multiple
abrasions, lacerations,

00:10:37,894 --> 00:10:39,729
contusions.

00:10:39,796 --> 00:10:42,165
I found no particular patterns,
sharp edges

00:10:42,231 --> 00:10:43,933
or tool marks from any weapons.

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,868
Do fists and feet count?

00:10:45,935 --> 00:10:49,539
He had too many
bruises to count,

00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:50,940
one on top of another.

00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,610
And under the skin,
things get even worse.

00:10:54,677 --> 00:10:57,613
Long bone fractures
of the fingers,

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,383
radius, ulna, humerus.

00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:03,252
Rib fractures, flail chest.

00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:05,755
Fractures of the vault
and base of skull.

00:11:05,822 --> 00:11:08,090
Almost every bone in his face.

00:11:08,157 --> 00:11:11,461
Somewhere along the way,
he took a shot to the head

00:11:11,527 --> 00:11:13,629
that resulted in
a subdural hematoma.

00:11:13,696 --> 00:11:16,766
COD is multiple
blunt force trauma.

00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,401
Could one person have done this?

00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:21,170
Not even Mike Tyson.

00:11:22,905 --> 00:11:24,073
MAN:
<i>Okay, okay, okay,</i>

00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,608
they took my good vodkas,
my single-malt whiskies,

00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:26,776
they took vermouth,
cognac, VSOP cognac.

00:11:26,843 --> 00:11:28,744
Am I going to get any
of the stuff back?

00:11:28,811 --> 00:11:30,480
What are you guys
going to do about this?

00:11:30,546 --> 00:11:32,048
Okay, slow down.
You're talking too fast.

00:11:32,114 --> 00:11:34,150
All right, you know what? Just
let me know when you're ready.

00:11:34,217 --> 00:11:37,820
I'm ready, sir, I just, I just
need you to talk slower.

00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:39,489
Okay, I can do that.

00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:40,723
These creeps
come flying in here,

00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,459
they take a lot
of my good stuff.

00:11:43,526 --> 00:11:44,861
And I chased one of them

00:11:44,927 --> 00:11:47,296
and I snatched the sweater
right off his back.

00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:49,165
How many did you see?

00:11:49,232 --> 00:11:51,734
I don't know.
There was a bunch.

00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:54,971
A bunch.
Two, five, ten?

00:11:55,037 --> 00:11:56,772
Closer to the ten.

00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:58,040
Any descriptions?

00:11:58,107 --> 00:12:00,143
They had hoods on.

00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:02,111
They were hooded.

00:12:03,646 --> 00:12:05,281
You took the sweater
off one of them

00:12:05,348 --> 00:12:07,450
and you didn't get to see
what he looked like?

00:12:07,517 --> 00:12:09,285
He was on his way
out the door.

00:12:09,352 --> 00:12:12,021
What I did see was really weird.

00:12:12,088 --> 00:12:13,289
Anyway.

00:12:13,356 --> 00:12:14,824
What does "weird" look like?

00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:15,925
I don't know.

00:12:15,992 --> 00:12:20,062
His face.
His nose was all deformed.

00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:21,964
The whole thing creeped me out.

00:12:26,536 --> 00:12:29,172
Thank you.

00:12:29,238 --> 00:12:31,140
Greg...

00:12:31,207 --> 00:12:33,676
lose the monkey suit,
you got a scene;

00:12:33,743 --> 00:12:34,710
liquor store robbery.

00:12:34,777 --> 00:12:35,812
Here's the address.

00:12:35,878 --> 00:12:37,947
Related to the earlier 415s?

00:12:38,014 --> 00:12:39,749
Could be-- Sofia's got one
of the suspect's sweaters.

00:12:39,816 --> 00:12:41,717
I need you to seal it,
bring it back here

00:12:41,784 --> 00:12:42,885
and anything else
you can find.

00:12:42,952 --> 00:12:44,821
All right.
Who's my wingman?

00:12:44,887 --> 00:12:45,988
You're a big boy, Greg.

00:12:46,055 --> 00:12:47,623
You don't need
a wingman for this.

00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:51,194
Primary. Nice.

00:13:04,774 --> 00:13:06,409
(grunting)

00:13:15,985 --> 00:13:17,353
Whoa!

00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,455
Pick on somebody
you're own size.

00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,192
Are you volunteering?

00:13:24,894 --> 00:13:25,862
No.

00:13:25,928 --> 00:13:28,431
The two scenes are related.

00:13:28,498 --> 00:13:30,933
I found two common
treads on both vics;

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,103
an athletic shoe and a boot.

00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,940
I ran them through
the Solemate database.

00:13:38,007 --> 00:13:40,009
The athletic shoe...

00:13:40,076 --> 00:13:42,078
is a Converse Chuck Taylor

00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:45,314
and the boot is a Doc Martin.

00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,185
Could this be a woman's shoe?

00:13:49,252 --> 00:13:52,088
Yeah, I ran that through
the Solemate database, too.

00:13:52,155 --> 00:13:54,257
That is a Steve Madden
Dynasti stiletto.

00:13:54,323 --> 00:13:55,758
Open-toe shoe.

00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:57,994
'Cause Catherine found
a broken female toenail

00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,929
in the vic's mouth.

00:14:01,764 --> 00:14:04,767
Most of the treads
are on the sides

00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:06,969
and back of the victim's
clothing.

00:14:07,036 --> 00:14:09,438
Which suggests that they
were on the ground

00:14:09,505 --> 00:14:11,407
for most of the beating.

00:14:11,474 --> 00:14:14,710
Kicked to death.

00:14:18,347 --> 00:14:19,782
(sobbing)

00:14:19,849 --> 00:14:22,652
How am I going to feed my boys?!

00:14:22,718 --> 00:14:28,491
Pay the rent,
gas, car? God...

00:14:28,558 --> 00:14:32,395
Mrs. Ruiz,
I'll do the best I can.

00:14:32,462 --> 00:14:34,564
I'll put you in touch
with State services

00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,700
that'll help you deal
with these issues, okay?

00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:40,036
But right now
I need your help
to do my job.

00:14:40,102 --> 00:14:42,305
I need some
information, okay?

00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:44,073
Whatever you need.

00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,375
All right. When was the last
time you talked to Vasco?

00:14:46,442 --> 00:14:49,412
Midnight.

00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:51,481
He calls me every night
after work.

00:14:51,547 --> 00:14:53,649
Did he have any enemies
that you know of?

00:14:53,716 --> 00:14:54,817
No.

00:14:54,884 --> 00:14:56,819
He was a good man with

00:14:56,886 --> 00:14:57,920
a good heart.

00:14:57,987 --> 00:14:59,155
No one disliked him.

00:14:59,222 --> 00:15:02,492
Okay. Did he carry a wallet
or a cell phone?

00:15:02,558 --> 00:15:04,360
He had both.

00:15:04,427 --> 00:15:06,496
I want you to write down
his cell phone number

00:15:06,562 --> 00:15:07,763
on this piece of paper, okay?

00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,732
I need to access
his records.

00:15:16,172 --> 00:15:17,240
Hey, guys,
this officer's

00:15:17,306 --> 00:15:20,343
going to take you
and your mom home,

00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:22,612
make sure you all
get home safe, okay?

00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:26,215
Thank you.

00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,789
REPORTER:
I'm standing across
from the Holiday Motel

00:15:32,855 --> 00:15:35,825
where a brutal beating
just occurred a few hours ago.

00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:38,394
We have the footage
which was recorded

00:15:38,461 --> 00:15:41,164
by an anonymous bystander's
cell phone.

00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,034
Although the quality is poor,
you can see several images

00:15:45,101 --> 00:15:47,970
assaulting the lone
female victim.

00:15:48,037 --> 00:15:51,274
Anyone living near the strip
is being told to stay at home

00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,575
until the assailant is caught.

00:15:52,642 --> 00:15:55,311
For anyone who has any
information,

00:15:55,378 --> 00:15:59,348
please call 555-0155.

00:15:59,415 --> 00:16:01,384
Get this reporter on the phone.

00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:37,854
Control, Control,
this is CSI Sanders.

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,921
I need some help.

00:16:38,988 --> 00:16:41,257
Control, go with your
information.

00:16:41,324 --> 00:16:45,094
Okay, I got an assault
in progress one alley south

00:16:45,161 --> 00:16:49,098
of Casino Central Drive,
cross street Shane.

00:16:49,165 --> 00:16:50,366
How many suspects involved?
Multiple suspects.

00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:52,969
Could be the guys who've
been doing it all night.

00:16:53,035 --> 00:16:54,770
The closest unit
has a five-minute ETA.

00:16:54,837 --> 00:16:56,506
Rolling Code Three.
Are they armed?

00:16:56,572 --> 00:16:58,040
I don't know. I don't know.

00:16:58,107 --> 00:16:59,642
Ma'am, please, listen.

00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:01,010
You got to get here quicker
than this.

00:17:01,077 --> 00:17:03,713
Copy that. We'll roll two
additional units ASAP.

00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,248
Wait for backup.

00:17:17,927 --> 00:17:21,030
(beeping horn)

00:17:21,097 --> 00:17:22,632
(horn blaring)

00:17:22,698 --> 00:17:23,800
Move!

00:17:23,866 --> 00:17:26,736
(thugs shouting)

00:17:32,408 --> 00:17:33,843
Get out of here!

00:17:34,977 --> 00:17:36,712
(horn blares)

00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:08,311
(glass shatters)

00:18:36,405 --> 00:18:38,608
(grunting)

00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,263
(girlish laughter)

00:19:00,329 --> 00:19:03,032
(man laughs)

00:19:34,045 --> 00:19:35,546
WOMAN:
Please, let me see
Demetrius.

00:19:35,613 --> 00:19:36,814
I just want to talk to him.

00:19:36,881 --> 00:19:37,949
I'm sorry.
It's a crime scene.

00:19:38,015 --> 00:19:39,217
I can't let you pass.
I'm sorry.

00:19:39,283 --> 00:19:40,218
He's not dead,
is he?

00:19:40,284 --> 00:19:41,986
He's been badly injured,

00:19:42,053 --> 00:19:43,721
but he's being attended
to, I promise you.

00:19:43,788 --> 00:19:45,156
Hey.
Hey.

00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:49,694
Why isn't there
a medic on Greg?

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,962
He's been stabilized.

00:19:51,028 --> 00:19:52,964
Sara, he's going
to be okay.

00:20:07,612 --> 00:20:08,646
(faintly):
Sara...

00:20:08,713 --> 00:20:11,649
I didn't think you could see me.

00:20:11,716 --> 00:20:14,986
I can't...

00:20:15,052 --> 00:20:17,221
but I know that Sidle scent.

00:20:17,288 --> 00:20:20,992
I'm going to take that
as a compliment.

00:20:24,862 --> 00:20:29,066
I scratched
one of them.

00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:31,802
And you should
check my vest.

00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:34,839
I think the same guy
spit on me.

00:20:37,975 --> 00:20:40,745
And one of their cars
crashed into the Denali.

00:20:40,811 --> 00:20:45,016
I guarantee
there's transfer on it.

00:20:47,418 --> 00:20:51,556
You should process
the scene now.

00:20:51,622 --> 00:20:52,924
Me later.

00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,260
I came here for you, Greg.

00:21:07,505 --> 00:21:10,274
BRASS:
So how long you been
in town, Mr. Tanner?

00:21:10,341 --> 00:21:13,644
About 20 hours, man.

00:21:13,711 --> 00:21:15,613
You on vacation?

00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,150
Straight from Union City,
Tennessee.

00:21:19,217 --> 00:21:21,552
Okay, tell me what happened.

00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:24,722
Well, I was cutting
through that alley

00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:29,360
trying to find a taxi
off one of them side streets.

00:21:29,427 --> 00:21:31,929
Next thing I know
I'm on the ground

00:21:31,996 --> 00:21:33,164
just getting pounded

00:21:33,231 --> 00:21:37,201
all to hell.

00:21:37,268 --> 00:21:38,769
I thought
I was gonna die.

00:21:38,836 --> 00:21:43,140
Even give it up to the Man.

00:21:43,207 --> 00:21:48,980
Then I heard that horn honking
and engine revving toward me.

00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:51,782
Can you give me
any descriptions?

00:21:54,018 --> 00:21:55,019
Okay.

00:21:55,086 --> 00:21:57,321
All right. You take it easy.

00:21:57,388 --> 00:22:00,424
Could you do me a favor?

00:22:00,491 --> 00:22:02,660
Sure, I'll do my best.

00:22:02,727 --> 00:22:04,962
The man that saved my life,

00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:08,499
I'd like to meet him,
give him a thank you.

00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:10,801
His name is Greg Sanders.

00:22:10,868 --> 00:22:13,037
And I'm sure he'd appreciate it.

00:22:13,104 --> 00:22:14,539
I'll tell him.

00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:18,509
(inaudible police radio
transmission)

00:22:18,576 --> 00:22:21,646
(camera shutter clicking)

00:22:21,712 --> 00:22:24,782
I think I just found
a piece of Sanders' hair.

00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:27,652
MAN:
So what, did somebody else
get a beat down?

00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,989
You bitches haven't caught
them cats yet?

00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:33,524
Excuse me?

00:22:33,591 --> 00:22:35,660
You fellas want
to keep it moving?

00:22:35,726 --> 00:22:37,061
We're trying to work here.

00:22:37,128 --> 00:22:39,664
You call that working?
Why is there an ass-whupping

00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,800
on every other block?
There's about to be an
ass-whupping on this block.

00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:44,135
Is that right?
That's right.

00:22:44,202 --> 00:22:45,570
BROWN:
Hey, Nick...

00:22:45,636 --> 00:22:48,906
Man, you're weak,
weak, weak, weak.
Come on, man.

00:22:48,973 --> 00:22:50,341
You can't do this.
MAN:
I'm sorry,

00:22:50,408 --> 00:22:52,076
I'll say
what I want.
you're not weak.

00:22:52,143 --> 00:22:53,878
Nick.

00:22:53,945 --> 00:22:56,380
Nick...

00:22:56,447 --> 00:22:58,349
You're a joke.

00:22:58,416 --> 00:22:59,884
BROWN:
Nick.

00:23:06,824 --> 00:23:08,392
Come on!

00:23:08,459 --> 00:23:10,228
Anybody get that on video?

00:23:10,294 --> 00:23:12,830
Man, I'll take a picture myself.

00:23:12,897 --> 00:23:15,933
That's a nice phone
you got there, man.

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,869
Real nice phone.

00:23:17,935 --> 00:23:20,037
Wonder how many
drug dealers' numbers you got

00:23:20,104 --> 00:23:22,073
on this phone here.

00:23:23,841 --> 00:23:26,878
Feel like going
to jail tonight?

00:23:26,944 --> 00:23:28,446
Listen, I'm sorry
about the little spill

00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,047
you had earlier,
but that's why we got

00:23:30,114 --> 00:23:31,883
the crime tape up,
so you could see it.

00:23:31,949 --> 00:23:34,085
Watch where you're going
next time.

00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:35,753
Get you home safely.

00:23:39,657 --> 00:23:41,259
What are you doing?

00:23:41,325 --> 00:23:42,927
We beating people up now?

00:23:42,994 --> 00:23:44,662
I'm sick of
these punks, man.

00:23:44,729 --> 00:23:46,330
I'm serious,
I'm sick of it.

00:23:46,397 --> 00:23:48,766
Then you're
in the wrong town.

00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:50,635
Maybe.

00:23:52,937 --> 00:23:56,073
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A. system)

00:24:10,221 --> 00:24:12,156
Greg?

00:24:16,694 --> 00:24:18,129
Grissom.

00:24:19,997 --> 00:24:22,934
Just another day
at the office, huh?

00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,137
Well, at least I can see now.

00:24:31,008 --> 00:24:33,511
The guy they beat up...

00:24:33,578 --> 00:24:35,012
how is he?

00:24:36,047 --> 00:24:38,950
He's gonna be fine.

00:24:41,285 --> 00:24:43,654
What about the other guy?

00:24:43,721 --> 00:24:46,324
The guy I hit.

00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,859
His name is Demitrius James.

00:24:48,926 --> 00:24:50,995
He's in surgery.

00:24:51,062 --> 00:24:55,433
Is he, like,
a gangbanger or something?

00:24:55,499 --> 00:24:58,135
Actually...

00:24:58,202 --> 00:25:00,972
he's a student
at the university.

00:25:01,973 --> 00:25:04,175
He gonna be okay?

00:25:04,242 --> 00:25:07,311
I don't know.

00:25:07,378 --> 00:25:10,514
(sighs)

00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,986
Has someone called your parents?

00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,256
We should let them know.

00:25:18,322 --> 00:25:20,024
(sighs):
Mm.

00:25:20,091 --> 00:25:21,659
What's the matter?

00:25:21,726 --> 00:25:25,162
They still think I'm in the lab.

00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:29,333
Why do they think that?

00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,804
When I was in high school...

00:25:33,871 --> 00:25:36,807
I never played any sports.

00:25:36,874 --> 00:25:41,145
No football, no basketball.

00:25:41,212 --> 00:25:43,814
Definitely no hockey.

00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:45,950
I never would've guessed.

00:25:46,017 --> 00:25:48,052
Well, it wasn't
by choice.

00:25:49,086 --> 00:25:52,189
My mom wanted four kids.

00:25:52,256 --> 00:25:55,259
Ended up with only one.

00:25:55,326 --> 00:26:00,698
She always made sure
I stayed close.

00:26:02,733 --> 00:26:05,336
If I got a nosebleed,

00:26:05,403 --> 00:26:07,471
she'd take me to the E.R.

00:26:07,538 --> 00:26:08,940
(chuckles weakly)

00:26:09,974 --> 00:26:12,376
Well...

00:26:12,443 --> 00:26:15,413
now would be the
time to come clean.

00:26:16,447 --> 00:26:20,284
My mom's gonna freak.

00:26:21,752 --> 00:26:24,355
You tell her that
you risked your life

00:26:24,422 --> 00:26:27,124
to save someone else's...

00:26:27,191 --> 00:26:30,294
and I think
she'll be very proud of you.

00:26:30,361 --> 00:26:33,231
(crying quietly)

00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,268
Hey.

00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:43,341
Doctor found these
on Demitrius James.

00:26:45,343 --> 00:26:47,879
Contact lenses.
Special kind.

00:26:47,945 --> 00:26:50,648
They're called Halloween lenses.

00:26:50,715 --> 00:26:52,817
They're wearing costumes.

00:26:53,851 --> 00:26:55,419
Great.

00:26:55,486 --> 00:26:57,788
Just a game to them.

00:27:13,337 --> 00:27:15,773
WILLOWS:
<i>Is that your number, Cha Cha?</i>

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,476
Yeah, that's my number.

00:27:18,543 --> 00:27:21,579
So tell me...

00:27:21,646 --> 00:27:23,681
what does a dead guy
sound like?

00:27:23,748 --> 00:27:26,117
(suppressed laughing)

00:27:26,183 --> 00:27:27,251
Oh, is that funny?

00:27:27,318 --> 00:27:30,655
Oh, man, I mean,
isn't it supposed to be?

00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:35,393
Someone called you
from his phone-- who was it?

00:27:35,459 --> 00:27:37,929
(exhales):
When'd they call again?

00:27:37,995 --> 00:27:39,630
12:33 a.m.,

00:27:39,697 --> 00:27:43,134
last night.
Man, you know how many people
blow me up at that time?

00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:45,336
Shoot, that's
like prime time.

00:27:45,403 --> 00:27:46,671
Finding-the-right-party time.

00:27:46,737 --> 00:27:49,507
Half my calls go to voice mail
my line's so busy.

00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,948
Who's this guy?
(sighs)

00:27:57,014 --> 00:27:59,917
M-Maybe I seen him before,
I don't know.

00:28:06,724 --> 00:28:08,326
Farami, huh?

00:28:14,065 --> 00:28:15,766
Yeah.

00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,835
You like?

00:28:17,902 --> 00:28:19,871
If it was real, I might.

00:28:19,937 --> 00:28:21,539
Whatever.

00:28:21,606 --> 00:28:23,941
Can I go now? Damn.

00:28:24,008 --> 00:28:26,143
When I swab that knockoff

00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:30,348
Farami buckle and I find
this tourist's DNA on it,

00:28:30,414 --> 00:28:31,916
you're going down
for murder.

00:28:31,983 --> 00:28:33,451
(scoffs):
She didn't die.

00:28:33,517 --> 00:28:35,353
No, but Mr. Ruiz did.

00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:37,722
And you were the last person
that he called.

00:28:37,788 --> 00:28:39,423
That connects you
to both crimes.

00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,825
(sighs)

00:28:40,892 --> 00:28:42,226
Tara, okay?

00:28:42,293 --> 00:28:43,828
Tara called me.

00:28:43,895 --> 00:28:45,763
It's funny, 'cause
the only reason

00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:49,333
I picked up my phone is 'cause
I didn't know the number.

00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,602
Thought it was this hot boy.

00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:53,437
And what did Tara want?

00:28:53,504 --> 00:28:54,872
(exhales)

00:28:54,939 --> 00:28:57,909
Her boyfriend Pig invited her
to a party at a motel.

00:28:57,975 --> 00:29:00,845
She invited me, so I rolled.

00:29:00,912 --> 00:29:04,482
(indistinct shouts)

00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:08,019
Go get a piece.
It's fun.

00:29:08,085 --> 00:29:10,087
(punches landing)

00:29:12,156 --> 00:29:15,226
Is that your idea of a party?

00:29:15,293 --> 00:29:17,895
Man, everyone loves
a good fannysmackin' session.

00:29:17,962 --> 00:29:19,430
A what?

00:29:19,497 --> 00:29:21,799
Beating up fannypackers.

00:29:21,866 --> 00:29:23,534
You know, tourists.

00:29:23,601 --> 00:29:25,903
Why would you want to do that?

00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,206
Nothing else to do.

00:29:28,272 --> 00:29:31,309
And you do this all the time?

00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:32,777
Yeah, but this was
the first time

00:29:32,843 --> 00:29:34,078
I ever heard of anyone dying.

00:29:35,346 --> 00:29:37,715
What is Pig's name?

00:29:37,782 --> 00:29:39,383
I just know "Pig."

00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:43,087
So if... fannysmackin'
is all about tourists,

00:29:43,154 --> 00:29:45,623
why'd you go after a dishwasher
at the Golden Sapphire?

00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,625
I don't know.

00:29:47,692 --> 00:29:50,294
Maybe he was just practice.

00:29:53,913 --> 00:29:56,516
So, you think we're
out of the woods yet?

00:29:56,582 --> 00:29:58,151
Well, beatings were
occurring every hour,

00:29:58,217 --> 00:30:01,254
and it's been three hours
since the last one, so maybe.

00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,456
MAN:
Do I look like
I want to sign in?

00:30:03,523 --> 00:30:06,125
I want to talk to cop, okay?
Somebody get me a cop!

00:30:06,192 --> 00:30:08,261
I want to talk
to a cop now!

00:30:08,327 --> 00:30:11,164
He's a cop.
She's a cop.

00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:13,800
Hey, my friend,
he got beat up and robbed.

00:30:13,866 --> 00:30:14,801
I can see that.
Where?

00:30:14,867 --> 00:30:15,802
On the corner

00:30:15,868 --> 00:30:17,437
of Decatur and Jones.

00:30:17,503 --> 00:30:19,705
They-they took the ten G's
that I had on me,

00:30:19,772 --> 00:30:21,207
they took my watch,

00:30:21,274 --> 00:30:22,975
they took my
cell phone.
And look at his face.

00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:24,377
They beat him up, too.

00:30:24,444 --> 00:30:25,411
Did you get a good look at 'em?

00:30:25,478 --> 00:30:26,813
Not really--
they were wearing hoodies.

00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:33,112
Processed the sweater
found at the liquor store.

00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:34,747
Found blood.

00:31:34,814 --> 00:31:36,249
Sent it to DNA.

00:31:36,315 --> 00:31:39,385
Wendy found two types,
matched both to your vics.

00:31:39,452 --> 00:31:42,021
She also ran saliva
on Greg's jacket.

00:31:42,088 --> 00:31:43,689
Came back unknown male.

00:31:43,756 --> 00:31:46,092
Same unknown male
that Greg scratched.

00:31:51,364 --> 00:31:53,599
Nice map.

00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:55,301
What do you see?

00:31:55,368 --> 00:31:57,370
My old neighborhood.

00:31:57,437 --> 00:31:58,971
What do you see?

00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:00,907
Inconsistency.

00:32:00,973 --> 00:32:02,575
In what?

00:32:02,642 --> 00:32:05,378
The dishwasher, both
tourists and Greg

00:32:05,445 --> 00:32:07,513
were attacked
near the Strip.

00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,248
Dean Harden claims
that he was attacked

00:32:09,315 --> 00:32:11,417
all the way over here
in Southwest Las Vegas.

00:32:11,484 --> 00:32:13,920
Swarms don't backtrack.

00:32:13,986 --> 00:32:16,956
We're talking about
humans here, not bugs.

00:32:17,023 --> 00:32:20,226
Humans have always adapted
strategies from insects.

00:32:20,293 --> 00:32:22,662
Swarming is
an ancient military tactic.

00:32:22,729 --> 00:32:25,064
You surround your enemies,
then attack

00:32:25,131 --> 00:32:26,666
from all directions
simultaneously.

00:32:26,733 --> 00:32:30,103
Alexander the Great pioneered
the maneuver 2,000 years ago.

00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:32,105
Although swarms consist
of several individuals,

00:32:32,171 --> 00:32:34,774
they must be treated
as a single entity,

00:32:34,841 --> 00:32:37,677
which lives,
thinks and moves as one,

00:32:37,744 --> 00:32:40,680
built with an internal logic
to continue forward,

00:32:40,747 --> 00:32:44,584
gain momentum
and never backtrack.

00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:48,654
So this guy Dean probably
was not a victim of this swarm,

00:32:48,721 --> 00:32:50,089
or he's lying.

00:32:50,156 --> 00:32:52,158
Take a look at these clothes.

00:32:52,225 --> 00:32:55,528
In contrast
to the other beatings,

00:32:55,595 --> 00:32:59,332
I found only one type of shoe
tread on Dean's clothing.

00:33:01,734 --> 00:33:03,669
The print matches a size 12

00:33:03,736 --> 00:33:06,372
Nike Air.

00:33:06,439 --> 00:33:09,208
And this shoe is...

00:33:09,275 --> 00:33:11,110
his own.

00:33:11,177 --> 00:33:14,013
He swarmed himself?

00:33:18,518 --> 00:33:19,886
I owe my Uncle Lenny
ten G's.

00:33:19,952 --> 00:33:21,320
and I don't got it,
all right?

00:33:21,387 --> 00:33:24,791
Am I supposed to know
who Uncle Lenny is?

00:33:24,857 --> 00:33:26,826
Uncle Lenny? Lenny G.

00:33:26,893 --> 00:33:28,194
The famous sports
handicapper.

00:33:28,261 --> 00:33:29,996
Yeah, it's not
ringing any bells.

00:33:30,063 --> 00:33:31,330
He's blackbooked
from the casinos.

00:33:31,397 --> 00:33:32,799
But he still likes to bet.

00:33:32,865 --> 00:33:35,001
And you bet for him.

00:33:35,068 --> 00:33:38,704
Yeah, he gave me five dimes to
bet the Eagles this past Sunday.

00:33:38,771 --> 00:33:39,906
You see, me and Ant,

00:33:39,972 --> 00:33:41,374
we're hurting
for cash right now.

00:33:41,441 --> 00:33:43,142
We didn't think
the Eagles had a chance,

00:33:43,209 --> 00:33:45,211
so we thought we would
just pocket the cash.

00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:48,414
But they won and now you owe
Uncle Lenny G. ten G's.

00:33:48,481 --> 00:33:52,418
Yeah. And when we saw
these beatings on TV and...

00:33:52,485 --> 00:33:55,088
just thought
it was a great idea.

00:33:55,154 --> 00:33:56,856
Don't go near the package.

00:33:56,923 --> 00:33:58,391
Why am I going to go
near your package?

00:33:58,458 --> 00:34:00,193
All right.
All right.

00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:01,794
It'll be like Pesci did it
to DeNiro in <i>Raging Bull.</i>

00:34:01,861 --> 00:34:03,396
Remember that?
Yeah, all right,
just do it, man, come on.

00:34:03,463 --> 00:34:04,831
Okay.
All right, just
do it, man!

00:34:04,897 --> 00:34:05,832
I'm doing it!

00:34:05,898 --> 00:34:08,501
(yells, groans)

00:34:08,568 --> 00:34:09,736
What, are you crying?

00:34:09,802 --> 00:34:11,571
Shut up, man!
It's not funny, all right?!

00:34:11,637 --> 00:34:14,107
I figured if Dean said
we got beat up and robbed,

00:34:14,173 --> 00:34:16,275
we wouldn't have to pay up.

00:34:16,342 --> 00:34:18,578
Yeah, well, now you're
eleven G's in the hole.

00:34:18,644 --> 00:34:20,580
The ten thousand

00:34:20,646 --> 00:34:22,181
you owe Uncle Lenny for the bet,

00:34:22,248 --> 00:34:24,917
and the thousand you owe us for
filing a false police report.

00:34:47,707 --> 00:34:51,744
(beeping)

00:34:55,248 --> 00:34:57,884
Hey, Catherine.
I think I'm on to something.

00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,519
Check this out.

00:35:02,622 --> 00:35:05,825
WILLOWS:
Oh... the King Swine.

00:35:05,892 --> 00:35:07,493
Now, "y'all" is plural.

00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,362
Believe me, I used
the word a lot,

00:35:09,429 --> 00:35:12,331
so I have a feeling he sent
that to more than one person.

00:35:12,398 --> 00:35:14,801
Could be a mass text.

00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:16,869
Lindsey once sent everyone
in her phonebook

00:35:16,936 --> 00:35:19,038
the same message
at the same time.

00:35:19,105 --> 00:35:20,907
I got stuck with a $300 bill.

00:35:20,973 --> 00:35:23,209
Hmm, we got this punk's
phone number.

00:35:23,276 --> 00:35:25,778
All we have to do is
subpoena his phone records.

00:35:25,845 --> 00:35:28,247
We'll get every one he
sent the message to.

00:35:28,314 --> 00:35:31,150
We'll text him, we'll tell
him to meet us somewhere.

00:35:31,217 --> 00:35:33,753
From Tara's phone?
They'll know it's us.

00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,954
No, from Pig's phone.

00:35:35,021 --> 00:35:36,122
We don't have Pig's phone.

00:35:36,189 --> 00:35:37,623
Don't need it.

00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:39,092
When you text
from a computer,

00:35:39,158 --> 00:35:42,095
you put in the number
that you're calling from.

00:35:42,161 --> 00:35:44,931
We'll just use Miss Piggy's.

00:35:44,997 --> 00:35:47,967
Okay, but how do we get the Pig?

00:35:49,635 --> 00:35:52,371
BRASS:
Look, I'm not going
to play you, Tara.

00:35:52,438 --> 00:35:54,440
So let's not waste
each other's time.

00:35:54,507 --> 00:35:56,142
I have enough evidence

00:35:56,209 --> 00:35:58,611
to try you for first
degree murder.

00:35:58,678 --> 00:35:59,779
But I'm greedy.

00:35:59,846 --> 00:36:02,315
I want the rest of
the Mickey Mouse Club.

00:36:02,382 --> 00:36:04,851
So you have a choice.

00:36:04,917 --> 00:36:09,288
You can either spend a very,
very long time in jail

00:36:09,355 --> 00:36:11,057
or you can help me out.

00:36:18,264 --> 00:36:19,899
I'm not saying nothing.

00:36:19,966 --> 00:36:21,667
You don't have to <i>sayanything.</i>

00:36:29,075 --> 00:36:31,544
Write a text message.

00:36:31,611 --> 00:36:33,546
Something Pig
would send to his buddies

00:36:33,613 --> 00:36:36,015
to gather them all up for
another fannysmackin' party.

00:36:36,082 --> 00:36:37,517
Look, Tara,
I don't think

00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:39,652
that beating these
people up was your idea,

00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:42,155
so why should you and
Cha Cha take the fall?

00:36:42,221 --> 00:36:43,956
These guys don't care about you.

00:36:44,023 --> 00:36:46,192
I mean, let's face it.

00:36:46,259 --> 00:36:48,995
You're just
a piece of tail to them.

00:36:49,062 --> 00:36:51,130
Right?

00:36:51,197 --> 00:36:53,666
So what's it
going to be?

00:36:53,733 --> 00:36:55,334
Are you going to let a guy

00:36:55,401 --> 00:36:58,004
with the colorful but
unfortunate name of "Pig"

00:36:58,071 --> 00:37:00,473
run free while
you go to jail?

00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,375
You know, it's
funky in there.

00:37:02,442 --> 00:37:04,744
No Posh Spice.

00:37:04,811 --> 00:37:07,580
No parties,
no purses or pedicures

00:37:07,647 --> 00:37:10,450
or pasta primavera.

00:37:10,516 --> 00:37:13,052
So you decide.

00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,855
Decide.

00:37:25,264 --> 00:37:28,234
(rap music playing)

00:37:28,301 --> 00:37:30,703
Pig text you?

00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,905
Yeah.

00:37:50,823 --> 00:37:53,426
Hey, Pig, thanks for that text.

00:37:53,493 --> 00:37:55,595
I'm ready for
some smackin'.
I didn't text you.

00:37:55,661 --> 00:37:58,564
You didn't?
Nah. Did you text me.

00:37:58,631 --> 00:37:59,999
I didn't text you.

00:38:00,066 --> 00:38:04,103
(sirens blaring)

00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:12,879
(weapons clicking)

00:38:14,414 --> 00:38:16,349
BRASS (over bullhorn):
Everybody out of the car, now.

00:38:16,416 --> 00:38:19,986
Get out of the car.
Let's see those hands.

00:38:20,053 --> 00:38:23,856
Put them on the top
of the car.

00:38:36,569 --> 00:38:39,305
(cocks shotgun)

00:38:43,743 --> 00:38:45,812
Turn off the truck.
Get out.

00:38:45,878 --> 00:38:48,381
And put your hands
above your head.

00:38:49,615 --> 00:38:53,319
BRASS (over bull horn):
Get out of the car.

00:39:02,729 --> 00:39:03,996
You're going to jail.

00:39:04,063 --> 00:39:06,766
Free shower, free food,
free sleep.

00:39:08,301 --> 00:39:09,535
(chuckles)

00:39:09,602 --> 00:39:10,703
Let me in there.

00:39:17,477 --> 00:39:23,249
This little piggy went, "Wee,
wee, wee," all the way home.

00:39:25,151 --> 00:39:27,387
(snorts)

00:39:36,729 --> 00:39:40,600
(indistinct PA announcement)

00:39:44,103 --> 00:39:46,439
NURSE:
I think this
is the room, sir.

00:39:46,506 --> 00:39:48,908
There he is.

00:39:48,975 --> 00:39:50,643
Mr. Sanders?

00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:53,079
Hey. How you doing?

00:39:53,146 --> 00:39:54,680
Better than dead.

00:39:54,747 --> 00:39:57,617
Get me over here, Lizzy, where
I can shake this man's hand.

00:40:01,621 --> 00:40:02,855
You're a brave man.

00:40:02,922 --> 00:40:03,956
Thank you.

00:40:04,023 --> 00:40:05,391
You're welcome.

00:40:05,458 --> 00:40:08,561
Home, Elizabeth.

00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,931
I cook some mean barbeque,

00:40:11,998 --> 00:40:14,067
If you ever get yourself
to Union City, Tennessee.

00:40:14,133 --> 00:40:15,535
I'll look you up.

00:40:15,601 --> 00:40:17,804
You do that.

00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:24,243
(woman hysterically sobbing)

00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:40,059
(hysterical sobbing continues)

00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:01,748
I am going to pick up
some Roberto's,

00:41:01,814 --> 00:41:02,849
take it over to Greg.

00:41:02,915 --> 00:41:04,050
I'm sure he's sick

00:41:04,117 --> 00:41:05,985
of that hospital food--
anybody want to come?

00:41:06,052 --> 00:41:07,854
I'll take a ride with you,

00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,988
but I'm going to pass

00:41:09,055 --> 00:41:10,957
on the Mexican food
at 10:00 in the morning.

00:41:11,023 --> 00:41:14,227
No, I'd like to see Greg.
I'm definitely in, yeah.

00:41:14,293 --> 00:41:17,930
Pig and the piglets

00:41:17,997 --> 00:41:19,298
are in the pig pen.

00:41:19,365 --> 00:41:22,468
It's about time.
Finally, some good news.

00:41:22,535 --> 00:41:23,836
Did you know that Pig,

00:41:23,903 --> 00:41:25,738
aka Cole Trit,
was the only adult.

00:41:25,805 --> 00:41:27,874
The rest of them
were under 18.

00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:30,143
One was 14.
Are you kidding?

00:41:30,209 --> 00:41:32,879
Who raises these kids?

00:41:32,945 --> 00:41:34,280
I mean, they weren't
all delinquents.

00:41:34,347 --> 00:41:36,149
Demitrius James was
a college student.

00:41:36,215 --> 00:41:38,985
Hanging out with the wrong
crowd in the wrong town.

00:41:39,052 --> 00:41:40,686
I'm telling you,
a fake ID

00:41:40,753 --> 00:41:42,188
<i>in Las Vegas is like having</i>

00:41:42,255 --> 00:41:44,424
<i>a free ticket</i>
<i>on the hell train.</i>

00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:49,362
<i>Sex, drugs, gambling,</i>
<i>no adult supervision, 24/7.</i>

00:41:49,429 --> 00:41:52,465
<i>By the time they're 21,</i>
<i>they've done and seen it all.</i>

00:41:52,532 --> 00:41:53,800
Make me slit my wrists,
why don't you?

00:41:53,866 --> 00:41:55,234
I'm raising a teenager here.

00:41:55,301 --> 00:41:57,236
Oh, you're doing a great job.
Lindsey's gonna turn out

00:41:57,303 --> 00:41:59,038
to be a beautiful
young woman.

00:41:59,105 --> 00:42:02,308
Besides, I grew up in Vegas,
I didn't turn out so bad, did I?

00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:03,910
Yeah, that was
pre-Mirage,

00:42:03,976 --> 00:42:06,279
back when you were
a little squirt

00:42:06,345 --> 00:42:08,781
going to the casino
playing the arcade games.

00:42:10,149 --> 00:42:12,585
<i>No, Vegas is a different</i>
<i>animal now.</i>

00:42:12,652 --> 00:42:14,120
BROWN:
<i>Yeah, these kids</i>

00:42:14,187 --> 00:42:16,489
<i>need to beat people on</i>
<i>the street to be entertained.</i>

00:42:16,556 --> 00:42:17,924
<i>They just need</i>
<i>some good discipline.</i>

00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:19,792
They need their
grandmother

00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:22,395
whupping their ass
like, like I had.

00:42:22,462 --> 00:42:24,097
Yeah, a good slap.

00:42:24,163 --> 00:42:27,100
You know, it kind of sounds like
your guys are blaming everybody

00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:28,668
but these kids.

00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,169
I mean, you don't get a bye

00:42:30,236 --> 00:42:32,505
just 'cause you grew up here
or your parents are on drugs.

00:42:32,572 --> 00:42:35,208
Those kids are
perfectly capable

00:42:35,274 --> 00:42:38,578
of telling the difference
between a wild night out and...

00:42:38,644 --> 00:42:40,513
beating somebody to death.

00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,182
The truth is...

00:42:43,249 --> 00:42:45,551
a moral compass can only point
you in the right direction,

00:42:45,618 --> 00:42:46,753
can't make you go there.

00:42:48,187 --> 00:42:49,856
Our culture preaches that, uh,

00:42:49,922 --> 00:42:52,225
you shouldn't be ashamed of
anything you do anymore.

00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:54,694
<i>And unfortunately, this city</i>
<i>was built on the principle</i>

00:42:54,761 --> 00:42:57,497
<i>that there's</i>
<i>no such thing as guilt.</i>

00:42:57,563 --> 00:42:59,132
<i>"Do whatever you want,</i>
<i>we won't tell."</i>

00:42:59,198 --> 00:43:00,867
<i>So without a conscience,</i>

00:43:00,933 --> 00:43:03,703
<i>there's nothing to stop you</i>
<i>from killing someone.</i>

00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:05,471
<i>And evidently,</i>

00:43:05,538 --> 00:43:07,473
you don't even
have to feel bad about it.
