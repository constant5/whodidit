BRASS:
Her name is Penny Garden.

00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:54,767
Age 65.

00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:56,469
Retired cocktail waitress.

00:01:56,535 --> 00:01:59,205
Been living here since
the Rat Pack days.

00:01:59,271 --> 00:02:01,407
She may have served them drinks.

00:02:01,474 --> 00:02:03,109
Well, they must have
tipped well because

00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:05,177
20 years ago, this was
a nice neighborhood.

00:02:05,244 --> 00:02:06,212
Anyway, a guy next door

00:02:06,278 --> 00:02:07,813
heard a racket,
called 911.

00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,182
Down the hallway,
there's a spare bedroom.

00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:11,250
The bed's unmade.

00:02:11,317 --> 00:02:13,486
So if the vic
had a houseguest,

00:02:13,552 --> 00:02:16,088
they're nowhere to be found,
so I'm going to dig around.

00:02:19,992 --> 00:02:21,761
GRISSOM:
Unfortunately,

00:02:21,827 --> 00:02:23,796
these windows aren't tempered.

00:02:23,863 --> 00:02:25,464
Very dangerous if broken.

00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:29,568
And she went through
face first.

00:02:29,635 --> 00:02:33,239
SIDLE:
The door's right here--
I doubt she missed it.

00:02:33,305 --> 00:02:36,108
Maybe she had some help.

00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:37,276
God.

00:02:37,343 --> 00:02:38,477
(screaming)

00:02:38,544 --> 00:02:41,847
Those coupons on the floor
on top of the glass

00:02:41,914 --> 00:02:43,682
suggests they were scattered

00:02:43,749 --> 00:02:44,984
after the window broke.

00:02:45,051 --> 00:02:46,952
Maybe they went through the room
after they killed her.

00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:50,723
There's nothing particularly
valuable here.

00:02:52,058 --> 00:02:54,527

Control, Control, this is

00:03:33,116 --> 00:03:34,684
WOMAN:
Control,
go with the information.

00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:35,785
Assault in progress.

00:03:35,852 --> 00:03:37,220
How many suspects?
Are they armed?

00:03:37,287 --> 00:03:39,422
Ma'am, please, they gotta
get here quicker than this.

00:03:41,091 --> 00:03:42,425
Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen.

00:03:42,492 --> 00:03:44,961
My name is Pete Athens.
I am the coroner

00:03:45,028 --> 00:03:47,364
of Clark County; I want
to thank you all for being here.

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,699
Coroner inquests
go back to medieval times

00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:52,068
during the reign
of Richard I in England.

00:03:52,135 --> 00:03:55,705
In fact, "coroner" comes
from the word "crown."

00:03:55,772 --> 00:03:58,942
A public inquest was one of the
crown's checks and balances

00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:00,210
on the powers of the sheriff.

00:04:00,277 --> 00:04:02,646
And today,
a thousand years later,

00:04:02,712 --> 00:04:04,748
it serves the same purpose

00:04:04,814 --> 00:04:09,486
in our county-- checks
and balances on the sheriff

00:04:09,552 --> 00:04:10,954
and for those who work for him.

00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:13,790
The Honorable Clayton Trueblood
will be our hearing master.

00:04:13,857 --> 00:04:17,661
He's not a judge, but he's going
to be more like a, um...

00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:19,095
a traffic cop,

00:04:19,162 --> 00:04:22,265
because an inquest
isn't a trial.

00:04:22,332 --> 00:04:25,869
We're going to examine
the death of Demetrius James.

00:04:25,936 --> 00:04:27,804
The assistant district attorney

00:04:27,871 --> 00:04:30,807
Valerie Nichols will present
the facts in the case,

00:04:30,874 --> 00:04:33,343
introduce the witnesses
and ask them questions.

00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,279
Any member of the jury
may also ask questions,

00:04:36,346 --> 00:04:38,915
either orally or in writing.

00:04:38,982 --> 00:04:41,151
I understand that there are

00:04:41,217 --> 00:04:43,887
family members
of the deceased present.

00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:58,134
I'm very sorry for your loss,
and I want you to know

00:04:58,201 --> 00:05:00,370
that as what the state
calls "interested parties,"

00:05:00,437 --> 00:05:01,805
you may ask questions, too.

00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:05,875
When all the facts have been
presented, the jury will then

00:05:05,942 --> 00:05:09,312
rule the death in question
as either justifiable,

00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:12,048
excusable or criminal.

00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:15,318
Cut's pretty deep.

00:05:15,385 --> 00:05:17,554
Let's try and keep her head on
while we move her.

00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:21,391
On three:
One, two, three.

00:05:34,404 --> 00:05:35,372
Hi.

00:05:35,438 --> 00:05:38,475
Grissom said you
could use some help.

00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,210
What haven't you done?

00:05:40,277 --> 00:05:42,312
The rest of the house.

00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,936
Hope I die before I get old.

00:06:41,371 --> 00:06:43,406
Man, I was just lampin'
in the crib with my boys

00:06:43,473 --> 00:06:45,575
when all of a sudden, psssh.

00:06:45,642 --> 00:06:47,644
I thought someone
was breaking in next door.

00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:50,780
Took a look over the fence,
old Penny was breaking out.

00:06:50,847 --> 00:06:53,917
Did you hear anything?
Any voices, yelling, screaming?

00:06:53,984 --> 00:06:57,020
Mm-mm. I don't even think
Mrs. Penny could scream.

00:06:57,087 --> 00:06:59,289
She had, like, a real
low, raspy voice.

00:06:59,356 --> 00:07:02,559
Yeah. Well, you
think that's sexy?

00:07:02,626 --> 00:07:04,227
Is that the
way you roll?

00:07:04,294 --> 00:07:05,228
Huh?

00:07:05,295 --> 00:07:06,463
All right,
I'll take that

00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:08,598
for a "no." You see
anybody leave the house?

00:07:08,665 --> 00:07:10,333
No, sir. Not last night.

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,102
Who's she got
staying with her?

00:07:12,168 --> 00:07:13,603
Don't know his name,
but I seen him

00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,905
always going
in and out of there.

00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:16,406
Describe him.

00:07:16,473 --> 00:07:17,607
White dude. Skinny.

00:07:17,674 --> 00:07:20,677
Always wears jeans
and white tees.

00:07:20,744 --> 00:07:24,981
Man.

00:07:25,048 --> 00:07:26,249
I liked that old lady.

00:07:26,316 --> 00:07:28,084
She made some good victuals

00:07:28,151 --> 00:07:30,253
and always had an extra
stogie if I was out.

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,321
This is my card.

00:07:31,388 --> 00:07:33,924
If you see that white
skinny guy, give me

00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,158
a call, will you?
Yeah.

00:07:35,225 --> 00:07:36,893
All right?
Yeah.

00:07:41,932 --> 00:07:45,035
You talk to that
guy in that house?

00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:47,003
Been there twice.
Still nobody home.

00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,273
Put someone on his doorstep
until he shows.

00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,275
He's got security cameras.
I want the video.

00:07:52,342 --> 00:07:54,611
CURTIS:
<i>The first attack that night</i>

00:07:54,678 --> 00:07:56,546
occurred just after midnight,

00:07:56,613 --> 00:07:58,815
in the employee parking
structure at the Golden

00:07:58,882 --> 00:08:00,684
Sapphire Hotel.

00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,987
A group of youths ranging
from teens to early 20s

00:08:04,054 --> 00:08:05,956
attacked Vasco Ruiz,

00:08:06,022 --> 00:08:08,825
a hotel dishwasher
on his way to his car.

00:08:08,892 --> 00:08:11,895
He was apparently
selected at random.

00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:20,870
Mr. Ruiz was found
dead at the scene.

00:08:20,937 --> 00:08:22,172
And what was the mob's

00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:23,340
next move?

00:08:23,406 --> 00:08:25,842
Approximately 30 minutes
after the first attack,

00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:29,045
not far away,
at the Holiday Motel,

00:08:29,112 --> 00:08:32,215
they attacked their next victim,
Jessica Hershbaum.

00:08:32,282 --> 00:08:34,884
(screaming):
Stop it! Stop it!

00:08:36,086 --> 00:08:38,722
Now, Miss Hershbaum survived.

00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:40,857
She's alive.

00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:44,594
But she has physical and
emotional scars from the attack

00:08:44,661 --> 00:08:48,331
that she may never recover from.

00:08:48,398 --> 00:08:50,834
So when Mr. Sanders
was coming to <i>your</i> crime scene,

00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,336
would he have known about these
first two swarming attacks?

00:08:53,403 --> 00:08:54,471
Absolutely.

00:08:54,537 --> 00:08:57,274
CSI was still processing
those crime scenes,

00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,043
and then I heard on my radio
about another attack--

00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,945
the third that night--

00:09:02,012 --> 00:09:04,948
and that a CSI was
one of the victims.

00:09:05,015 --> 00:09:07,384
Is this the location
of the third swarming attack?

00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,385
Yes.

00:09:08,451 --> 00:09:10,253
I drove over there immediately.

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,955
And what did you find?

00:09:12,022 --> 00:09:14,224
Three men,
all seriously injured.

00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:20,363
Stanley Tanner was unconscious,
as was Demetrius James.

00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,599
The mob had pulled

00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,168
CSI Sanders from his vehicle
and beaten him.

00:09:27,037 --> 00:09:29,773
But it was his intervention that
saved Stanley Tanner's life.

00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,652
While I appreciate
your participation

00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:43,753
in the process here,

00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,655
I don't find this
question relevant.

00:09:45,722 --> 00:09:47,290
Excuse me, Your Honor.

00:09:47,357 --> 00:09:48,491
The question's
quite relevant.

00:09:48,558 --> 00:09:50,327
Are we just going
through the motions here,

00:09:50,393 --> 00:09:52,095
so it looks like someone
actually asked

00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:53,763
whether or not it's okay
to run over

00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:54,998
black kids
in the street?

00:09:55,065 --> 00:09:56,533
JUDGE:
Do you have a question, sir?

00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,801
Yeah.

00:09:57,867 --> 00:10:00,503
Are you also going to be
censoring verbal questions?

00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,341
Relevance is
at my discretion here.

00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:06,409
Now, please, take your seat.

00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:20,133
ROBBINS:
<i>Multiple lacerations</i>
<i>on face, neck</i>

00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,637
shoulders-- if it weren't for
the couple dozen glass fragments

00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:25,305
I tweezed out, I'd say somebody

00:10:25,372 --> 00:10:27,707
went to town on her
with a straight razor.

00:10:27,774 --> 00:10:30,977
C.O.D. is exsanguination
due to sharp force injury

00:10:31,044 --> 00:10:32,946
to the jugular-carotid
complex,

00:10:33,013 --> 00:10:36,183
but she was already
on her way out.

00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:39,953
Cannonballs of tumors
on her lungs.

00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,422
Man... her cancer had cancer.

00:10:42,489 --> 00:10:44,457
I guess she liked smoking
more than living, huh?

00:10:44,524 --> 00:10:47,160
Or else she wanted to die
with a cigarette in her mouth.

00:10:47,227 --> 00:10:50,864
You know, Catherine found
antidepressants, laxatives,

00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:53,166
acid-reflux meds
in her house,

00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:55,468
but I don't think
she found anything for pain.

00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:57,804
I guarantee you,
this lady was in pain.

00:10:57,871 --> 00:10:59,839
She must have been
taking something for it.

00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:02,876
Maybe the killer
took it with him.

00:11:02,943 --> 00:11:05,579
Well, there's a big market
for that stuff now.

00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:07,180
I'll get her medical records.

00:11:28,869 --> 00:11:31,037
Did you find something?

00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:33,173
Bloody glass.

00:11:35,876 --> 00:11:37,844
The killer on his way out?

00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,225
MAN:
You can't keep me
out of there!

00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:26,726
This is where
I live, man!

00:12:26,793 --> 00:12:27,994
Sorry, son.
This is a crime scene.

00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:29,062
You don't want
to be in there.

00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:30,397
Look, I just want to see

00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:32,332
my Auntie Penny.
Where is she?
Calm... calm down.

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,900
I don't want to calm down!

00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:35,202
Do you live here?

00:12:35,268 --> 00:12:36,369
Yeah, that's what I was
just telling this guy.

00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:38,104
What's going on?
What's your name?

00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:40,106
Henry. Henry Briney.

00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:41,474
Henry, I'm going to need you

00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,109
to come down
to the police station,

00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:44,311
give us a statement.

00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:45,378
For what?

00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:47,280
Um...

00:12:47,347 --> 00:12:50,317
Sorry to tell you,
but your aunt is dead.

00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:55,589
NICHOLS:
<i>Mr. Tanner, can you tell us</i>
<i>what injuries you sustained</i>

00:12:55,655 --> 00:12:57,424
<i>as a result of the attack?</i>

00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,161
Cuts, some of them pretty bad,
mostly on my face.

00:13:01,228 --> 00:13:04,764
Broke left arm,
crushed windpipe,

00:13:04,831 --> 00:13:09,102
one eye socket cracked,
broke right ankle.

00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:11,304
And I got
this headache

00:13:11,371 --> 00:13:13,640
they tell me
might be permanent.

00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:15,408
Would it be correct to say

00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:16,710
that while you
were being attacked,

00:13:16,776 --> 00:13:18,411
you felt like
your life was in danger?

00:13:18,478 --> 00:13:20,547
Hell, yeah.

00:13:20,614 --> 00:13:21,715
I have a question.

00:13:21,781 --> 00:13:22,916
Go ahead.

00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:24,050
Did you actually see

00:13:24,117 --> 00:13:27,220
Demetrius James attacking you?

00:13:27,287 --> 00:13:29,155
Oh, I couldn't tell who was who.

00:13:29,222 --> 00:13:31,091
I mean, hell,
my hands were on my face.

00:13:31,157 --> 00:13:33,426
I was just trying
to stay alive.

00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:36,763
If Mr. Sanders hadn't
shown up just then,

00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,833
I'd have been
like that first guy-- dead.

00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,235
There was a large laceration

00:13:42,302 --> 00:13:44,905
where Demetrius James' head
hit the ground when he fell.

00:13:44,971 --> 00:13:47,841
Underlying that wound
was a fracture

00:13:47,908 --> 00:13:49,509
of the occipital bone,
which crosses

00:13:49,576 --> 00:13:50,844
at the base of the skull.

00:13:50,911 --> 00:13:53,346
The motion of the impact

00:13:53,413 --> 00:13:55,482
caused the brain to
collide with the bony

00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:57,651
protrusions
inside the skull,

00:13:57,717 --> 00:14:00,687
resulting in what
we call contra-coup contusions.

00:14:00,754 --> 00:14:04,124
There was also prominent
cerebral edema-- or swelling--

00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:06,993
as well as hemorrhages
of the brain stem.

00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,130
So your official cause
of death was...?

00:14:10,197 --> 00:14:11,865
Blunt force trauma to the head

00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:14,167
following a motor
vehicle collision.

00:14:14,234 --> 00:14:16,536
So this was a death
at the hands of another?

00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:18,205
Yes.

00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:20,540
And what do you call
that kind of death?

00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:25,412
A homicide.

00:14:30,116 --> 00:14:33,153
So where did
you go last night?

00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,488
Movies.

00:14:35,555 --> 00:14:37,190
Oh, a ticket stub.
That's good.

00:14:37,257 --> 00:14:39,292
Who'd you go with?
You went by yourself?

00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,961
Who else would I go with?

00:14:41,027 --> 00:14:42,696
I don't know. A friend?

00:14:42,762 --> 00:14:44,497
No. I don't have friends.

00:14:44,564 --> 00:14:47,100
Okay, so the movie ended.

00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:48,969
You're all by yourself,
then what?

00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:50,704
I sat in the keno lounge
all night,

00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,973
hit the grocery store,
and then came home to cops.

00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:55,408
Why are you staying
at your Aunt Penny's?

00:14:55,475 --> 00:14:58,111
Because my parents
threw me out.

00:14:58,178 --> 00:15:00,881
Why would
they do that?

00:15:00,947 --> 00:15:03,250
Because they don't like me.

00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:05,385
Let me see your arms.

00:15:08,655 --> 00:15:11,525
Are you booting
that good "doodgie"?

00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:13,727
You ever use intravenous drugs?

00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:16,229
Not anymore,
but I did for a while.

00:15:16,296 --> 00:15:18,365
You know, your Aunt Penny
had some scrips

00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:21,001
for some pain medication--
oxycontin,

00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:22,068
fentanyl, methadone.

00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:23,703
When we searched
her house,

00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,938
we didn't find any.

00:15:25,005 --> 00:15:26,006
Did you take them?

00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:27,774
No, I didn't take them.

00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:29,175
She must have
taken them.

00:15:29,242 --> 00:15:30,410
I don't touch them.

00:15:30,477 --> 00:15:32,045
I just got out of rehab.

00:15:32,112 --> 00:15:35,382
Haven't touched a pill,
line or needle

00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:37,918
in six months.

00:15:37,984 --> 00:15:40,921
My parents threw me out,
and she took me in.

00:15:40,987 --> 00:15:43,590
I would not screw her over.

00:15:43,657 --> 00:15:47,494
We're going to need to take
your clothes and your shoes.

00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:01,241
Any luck?

00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:02,676
No.

00:16:02,742 --> 00:16:04,845
No blood on the nephew's
shoes or clothes.

00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:07,414
Drug panel on his urine
came back negative.

00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,615
He's clean.

00:16:08,682 --> 00:16:10,450
What about
Auntie Penny?

00:16:10,517 --> 00:16:12,686
No pain meds
in her system either.

00:16:12,752 --> 00:16:14,354
We've got a lot
of serious drugs

00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:16,456
that are unaccounted for.

00:16:16,523 --> 00:16:18,859
These glass fragments

00:16:18,925 --> 00:16:20,994
are from the mob
breaking out the windows

00:16:21,061 --> 00:16:23,396
of CSI Sanders' Denali.

00:16:23,463 --> 00:16:26,032
<i>That's how</i>
<i>they dragged him out.</i>

00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:30,337
This is a clump
of his hair,

00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:34,441
<i>torn from his scalp.</i>

00:16:34,507 --> 00:16:36,676
And that's the rock

00:16:36,743 --> 00:16:38,745
Demetrius James
used as a weapon.

00:16:38,812 --> 00:16:41,681
According to who?

00:16:41,748 --> 00:16:43,183
This is the first
we've even

00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,684
heard that Demetrius James
had a weapon.

00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:48,288
In his report, Mr. Sanders
testified to that fact.

00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:49,923
The rock was found at the scene.

00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,925
How do we know the cops
didn't plant it there?

00:16:51,992 --> 00:16:54,027
Sir, I've warned you.

00:16:54,094 --> 00:16:55,929
I'd like to answer
that question.

00:16:55,996 --> 00:16:57,597
Usually, when
someone plants

00:16:57,664 --> 00:16:59,599
a weapon, whoever did it
puts it right beside

00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:00,934
the body--
in this case,

00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:03,503
the rock was found near
the front tire of the Denali.

00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,872
Skid marks suggest
it was dropped upon impact.

00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,575
A rock against
two tons of steel.

00:17:08,642 --> 00:17:09,976
No. More like

00:17:10,043 --> 00:17:12,879
one man against an extremely
violent, out of control mob.

00:17:12,946 --> 00:17:16,716
What's department policy
in a situation like that?

00:17:16,783 --> 00:17:18,785
It has always been

00:17:18,852 --> 00:17:22,289
department policy
not to harm innocent civilians.

00:17:22,355 --> 00:17:25,859
You call for backup,
you try to be a good witness,

00:17:25,926 --> 00:17:27,561
and you stay out of the way.

00:17:27,627 --> 00:17:30,363
So what makes it okay
to start running over people?

00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,999
Well, when those people
are wearing masks,

00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:34,367
running around
beating people up.

00:17:34,434 --> 00:17:36,002
Man, D.J. was going
to a costume party.

00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:38,238
One victim was dead.

00:17:38,305 --> 00:17:40,974
Another was
seriously injured.

00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,509
Another fatality imminent.

00:17:42,576 --> 00:17:45,145
I'd say the use of deadly force
in this case

00:17:45,212 --> 00:17:47,214
was consistent
with department policy,

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,849
absolutely.

00:17:48,915 --> 00:17:50,684
NICHOLS:
Demetrius James
was going

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,719
to finish off the victim
with the rock.

00:17:52,786 --> 00:17:55,155
You're a liar!
My brother
wasn't a killer!

00:17:55,222 --> 00:17:56,056
Excuse me.

00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:58,091
Demetrius was going to college
Mrs. James.

00:17:58,158 --> 00:18:00,994
He had a 3.6 GPA.

00:18:01,061 --> 00:18:02,329
We are all very sorry
for your loss,

00:18:02,395 --> 00:18:03,496
but you are not a witness here.

00:18:03,563 --> 00:18:05,732
You didn't know him!
(shouting)

00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:06,867
I do! We knew him!

00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:09,035
Judge, can we have
some order here?

00:18:09,102 --> 00:18:10,337
You didn't run over a mob,

00:18:10,403 --> 00:18:12,172
you ran over one boy!

00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:14,608
My boy!

00:18:17,244 --> 00:18:19,079
(crying)

00:18:19,145 --> 00:18:21,014
Judge?

00:18:21,081 --> 00:18:23,517
Mrs. James' comments
give context

00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,285
to the events
of the night in question.

00:18:25,352 --> 00:18:28,288
I'd like to hear
what she has to say.

00:18:30,857 --> 00:18:33,727
Why is Trueblood
letting her do this?

00:18:33,793 --> 00:18:35,929
It's probably good
for his campaign.

00:18:35,996 --> 00:18:37,931
He's running for Assembly.

00:18:37,998 --> 00:18:40,433
Now you tell me.

00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,702
Got your page.

00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:44,104
Surveillance footage

00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,873
from the neighborhood watch
guy across the street.

00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,543
Yeah, he was paranoid,
but lazy.

00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:51,378
Had four security
cameras on his house,

00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:53,613
three of them
were cardboard boxes.

00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,649
Homemade security
is the worst.

00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:57,651
Okay, so the nephew comes
in and out of the house

00:18:57,717 --> 00:18:59,786
a couple times
during the day.

00:18:59,853 --> 00:19:02,255
It's a whole different
story next door.

00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:07,160
Okay, this guy

00:19:07,227 --> 00:19:10,130
comes out of the house and
meets with a different car

00:19:10,197 --> 00:19:13,099
at least three
times and hour.

00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,602
He's slinging drugs.

00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:18,271
BRASS:
The white one is
carisoprodol.

00:19:18,338 --> 00:19:19,906
It's a muscle relaxant.

00:19:19,973 --> 00:19:22,342
Yeah, I strained my pecs
bench pressing.

00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:24,211
Oh, yeah.

00:19:24,277 --> 00:19:25,979
And the blue one
is Prevalis.

00:19:26,046 --> 00:19:28,081
You look a little
young to need that.

00:19:28,148 --> 00:19:31,184
Well, I've had
my share of women.

00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:33,453
Mr. Johnson's gotten
bored over the years, so?

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,388
Well, he's going to get
really bored in prison.

00:19:35,455 --> 00:19:36,590
You hope.

00:19:36,656 --> 00:19:38,625
What, you gonna bust me
for selling Prevalis?

00:19:38,692 --> 00:19:40,260
Well, you think a guy in my job
doesn't know

00:19:40,327 --> 00:19:41,862
what goes on in the clubs
and in the street?

00:19:41,928 --> 00:19:43,129
You ever hear of
a Las Vegas Cocktail.

00:19:43,196 --> 00:19:45,165
I don't drink.

00:19:45,232 --> 00:19:48,501
It's a combination
of carisoprodol, Prevalis

00:19:48,568 --> 00:19:51,204
and very strong painkiller
called fentanyl.

00:19:51,271 --> 00:19:52,772
Problem is, fentanyl's
hard to get.

00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,040
I mean, doctors
don't just

00:19:54,107 --> 00:19:55,742
give it away, you got to be

00:19:55,809 --> 00:19:57,511
in really
serious pain to get it,

00:19:57,577 --> 00:19:59,479
like dying
of cancer.

00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:02,382
On the street it's
called "perc-a-pop".

00:20:02,449 --> 00:20:04,651
Now, Penny Garden
was prescribed 40 a month.

00:20:04,718 --> 00:20:06,887
Problem is, we couldn't find
any in her house.

00:20:06,953 --> 00:20:08,622
So what, you think I stole them?

00:20:08,688 --> 00:20:09,689
Yeah, I do.

00:20:11,258 --> 00:20:12,726
Where are the pops, old lady?

00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:14,294
Get out of my house.

00:20:14,361 --> 00:20:15,996
Where are they?

00:20:16,062 --> 00:20:17,364
I'll call the police.

00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,566
No you won't.

00:20:21,201 --> 00:20:22,335
Never.

00:20:22,402 --> 00:20:23,403
Never, never, never.

00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,105
Look, I told you,
I liked the lady.

00:20:25,171 --> 00:20:27,807
She made me dinner.
She lent me smokes, man.

00:20:27,874 --> 00:20:29,709
You liked her 'cause she had
what you needed.

00:20:29,776 --> 00:20:31,344
No, man. No way.

00:20:31,411 --> 00:20:34,181
Hey, I need a lawyer in here.

00:20:34,247 --> 00:20:36,483
So we have a drug dealer
and a former drug user,

00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,652
both of which would have
motive to steal Penny's drugs.

00:20:38,718 --> 00:20:40,120
Well, there wasn't
any trace of fentanyl

00:20:40,187 --> 00:20:41,188
in the nephew's system.

00:20:41,254 --> 00:20:42,355
He's broke,
he's unemployed,

00:20:42,422 --> 00:20:43,590
maybe he's stealing
them Penny

00:20:43,657 --> 00:20:45,325
so he can sell them
to the neighbor.

00:20:45,392 --> 00:20:47,327
If that's the case,
it's motive for both.

00:20:47,394 --> 00:20:48,328
HENRY:
Excuse me.

00:20:48,395 --> 00:20:50,530
Hi, Henry.

00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:51,998
What are you
doing here?

00:20:52,065 --> 00:20:54,601
Um... I just found this

00:20:54,668 --> 00:20:56,203
on my porch--
I opened it

00:20:56,269 --> 00:20:57,737
and thought I should
bring it down to you guys.

00:20:57,804 --> 00:21:00,440
It's... pretty creepy.

00:21:36,584 --> 00:21:38,953
SIDLE:
If one was horrifying...

00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:42,290
...what is two?

00:21:42,357 --> 00:21:45,093
Possible serial killer.

00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,097
I'd say that it takes the nephew
and the neighbor off the hook.

00:21:49,164 --> 00:21:50,598
I doubt either one of them

00:21:50,665 --> 00:21:53,401
could afford a mini-contractor,
anyway.

00:22:06,047 --> 00:22:07,615
A bloody doll.

00:22:07,682 --> 00:22:11,019
Similar to the one
in the other miniature.

00:22:14,689 --> 00:22:18,026
GRISSOM:
Look at the blood
on the doll's forehead.

00:22:18,093 --> 00:22:19,494
Same pattern
on both.

00:22:19,561 --> 00:22:23,131
Could be two different
views of the same subject.

00:22:23,198 --> 00:22:25,233
Maybe it's a signature.

00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,801
Yeah, but we have
no context.

00:22:26,868 --> 00:22:28,770
It could mean or represent
just about anything.

00:22:28,837 --> 00:22:30,739
Okay...

00:22:30,805 --> 00:22:35,043
again, the miniature
suggests that the killer

00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,411
had an intimate
familiarity

00:22:36,478 --> 00:22:40,081
with victim, home and habits.

00:22:40,148 --> 00:22:43,918
So what do they have
in common?

00:22:43,985 --> 00:22:47,188
Izzy Delancy, 50-year-old
white male,

00:22:47,255 --> 00:22:49,491
washed-up rock star.

00:22:49,557 --> 00:22:53,928
Penny Garden, cancer-stricken
retiree.

00:22:53,995 --> 00:22:55,196
Different friends,
different family,

00:22:55,263 --> 00:22:56,631
different social circles.

00:22:56,698 --> 00:23:00,068
Why wasn't this one
left at the crime
scene like that one?

00:23:05,206 --> 00:23:06,875
(rattling)

00:23:12,614 --> 00:23:16,184
Marla and Aaron James
are not sworn witnesses.

00:23:16,251 --> 00:23:18,987
If they were, they couldn't
be in the courtroom

00:23:19,054 --> 00:23:22,457
during testimony and that
would effectively take
away their rights

00:23:22,524 --> 00:23:25,994
as interested parties
to question witnesses.

00:23:26,061 --> 00:23:28,496
So please try to remember
that their remarks

00:23:28,563 --> 00:23:29,864
are not evidence.

00:23:29,931 --> 00:23:32,834
Go ahead.

00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:39,407
My sons didn't grow up
with a father.

00:23:39,474 --> 00:23:41,476
Barely had a mother...

00:23:41,543 --> 00:23:44,346
on account of me
working all the time.

00:23:44,412 --> 00:23:47,248
They got into trouble.

00:23:47,315 --> 00:23:49,050
Mostly 'cause of where we live.

00:23:49,117 --> 00:23:52,153
Aaron here, he got into
a whole lot of trouble.

00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,788
And I did my time, too.

00:23:53,855 --> 00:23:57,258
I did my time,
but that wasn't D.J.

00:23:57,325 --> 00:23:59,828
He was helping me
turn my life around.

00:23:59,894 --> 00:24:03,198
Coached me on
my GED.

00:24:03,264 --> 00:24:07,268
Made me feel like there was
a chance for me, you know.

00:24:09,004 --> 00:24:10,905
Man, you have no idea
what you killed

00:24:10,972 --> 00:24:12,307
when you killed my brother.

00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:18,513
Everyone was moved by the
compelling testimony...
Today, in the courthouse,

00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,216
...of the victim's mother...
it wasn't the judge,
the jury or the lawyer,

00:24:21,282 --> 00:24:22,984
instead it was the mother,
of Demitrius James

00:24:23,051 --> 00:24:25,787
that had the courtroom asking
did her her son behave...

00:24:25,854 --> 00:24:27,055
Hey.

00:24:27,122 --> 00:24:28,890
Nichols was right.

00:24:28,957 --> 00:24:30,458
This isn't a trial,
it's a circus.

00:24:30,525 --> 00:24:33,395
Yeah, I heard.
Starring the mother.

00:24:38,967 --> 00:24:41,403
I feel like I should
say something.

00:24:41,469 --> 00:24:42,837
Like what?

00:24:42,904 --> 00:24:44,939
I don't know.
Sorry?

00:24:45,006 --> 00:24:47,709
You going to apologize
to the mother of a guy

00:24:47,776 --> 00:24:49,210
who beat one man
to death

00:24:49,277 --> 00:24:51,212
and was trying to do
the same to you?

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,814
That's as good as
saying you're guilty

00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:55,884
and setting yourself up for one
hell of a civil suit besides.

00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,719
You did nothing wrong.

and sometimes, we pay one hell
of a price for surviving it.

00:25:06,661 --> 00:25:09,531
Other people will never
understand that.

00:25:11,566 --> 00:25:13,868
No way D.J. was
a violent person.

00:25:13,935 --> 00:25:16,338
My son is not a killer.

00:25:16,404 --> 00:25:18,940

picked up a rock...

00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,118
before going to work,

00:33:42,185 --> 00:33:46,022
would Demitrius James
still be alive?

00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,529
Alcohol wasn't...

00:33:52,596 --> 00:33:54,498
a factor.

00:33:54,564 --> 00:33:59,136
A.D.A. Ulrich insisted
on ordering the wine.

00:33:59,202 --> 00:34:01,104
I drank half a glass.

00:34:01,171 --> 00:34:02,739
About six ounces.

00:34:02,806 --> 00:34:05,175
At my weight, 150,
that would give me

00:34:05,242 --> 00:34:08,778
a blood-alcohol content
of .02%.

00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:10,614
Even without food,

00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:16,820
the alcohol burn-off rate
would be .015% per hour...

00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:20,757
meaning that there was
no alcohol in my bloodstream

00:34:20,824 --> 00:34:24,494
after 90 minutes, well before
I reported for my shift

00:34:24,561 --> 00:34:27,164
and about... seven hours

00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,132
before the incident.

00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,868
(people murmuring)

00:34:35,906 --> 00:34:38,175
SIDLE:
<i>This is where we found</i>

00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:41,178
your aunt's fentanyl, so we
know that you didn't take it.

00:34:41,244 --> 00:34:44,080
Which means you've gone
from a suspect...

00:34:44,147 --> 00:34:45,749
To a witness.

00:34:45,816 --> 00:34:49,753
Now it's up to you
to help us find the real killer.

00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,088
If you really
cared about Penny,

00:34:52,155 --> 00:34:55,125
you'll tell us the
truth about everything.

00:34:55,192 --> 00:34:58,094
So this is off the record?
Yeah.

00:34:58,161 --> 00:35:01,398
(sighs):
So I ain't going to jail?

00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:05,001
Yeah, what do you
want to know?

00:35:05,068 --> 00:35:08,605
Who was Penny hiding
her drugs from?

00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,806
I don't know.

00:35:09,873 --> 00:35:11,141
Maybe it was me.

00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:13,243
Although I never
would've taken them.

00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,912
Or maybe you should ask
the guy next-door.

00:35:15,979 --> 00:35:18,815
No, man, I'd never take
those things from her.

00:35:18,882 --> 00:35:20,851
I buy 'em,
50 bucks a pop.

00:35:25,522 --> 00:35:27,591
(man coughs)

00:35:27,657 --> 00:35:30,760
Did you know your aunt
was selling her drugs?

00:35:30,827 --> 00:35:32,229
Yeah, I had an idea.

00:35:32,295 --> 00:35:34,931
I figured it was how she
was supporting her habit.

00:35:34,998 --> 00:35:36,733
Which one?

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,201
I guess
I should've said "habits."

00:35:38,268 --> 00:35:41,505
Um, she loved her liqueur,
and she loved her cigarettes,

00:35:41,571 --> 00:35:43,773
but what she really loved
was video poker.

00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,511
She liked the sound
the coins made when
she hit a jackpot.

00:35:47,577 --> 00:35:51,148
She offered me a couple
of bucks a week to keep
the house clean, and...

00:35:51,214 --> 00:35:53,283
(laughs):
and she paid me in
nickels and quarters.

00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,652
Can you think...

00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:58,421
of anyone else
that might have known

00:35:58,488 --> 00:36:00,190
that those drugs were there?

00:36:00,257 --> 00:36:05,061
No. I lived with her
for a couple of months, and...

00:36:05,128 --> 00:36:08,632
and she never had anyone over
but me.

00:36:45,635 --> 00:36:47,571
I know that look.

00:36:47,637 --> 00:36:50,173
You just figured
something out.

00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:55,345
This is much better
than dead rock star kitchen.

00:36:55,412 --> 00:36:57,414
The whole al fresco thing?

00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,483
Come on, share.

00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:01,318
Please?

00:37:01,384 --> 00:37:04,488
Look carefully at
the back of the doll

00:37:04,554 --> 00:37:07,357
and at the pillow
on the chair.

00:37:07,424 --> 00:37:09,025
There appears to be remnants

00:37:09,092 --> 00:37:11,461
of glue on both.

00:37:11,528 --> 00:37:13,997
HODGES:
So the doll was originally

00:37:14,064 --> 00:37:17,567
glued to the back
of the chair.

00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:22,139
I think the killer
expected the victim to die

00:37:22,205 --> 00:37:24,374
in this chair.

00:37:38,955 --> 00:37:42,759
Well, if that's the case, then
how did the killer expect to...

00:37:42,826 --> 00:37:44,861
kill her?

00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:08,518
JUDGE:
I understand the jury
has reached a verdict?

00:38:08,585 --> 00:38:10,587
WOMAN:
We have, Your Honor.

00:38:11,755 --> 00:38:13,890
We, the jury in this inquest,

00:38:13,957 --> 00:38:16,760
find the death
of Demitrius James excusable.

00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:19,796
(people murmuring)

00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,402
Well, thank you,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,770
Judge Trueblood.

00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,872
This inquest is concluded.

00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,907
"Excusa..." No.

00:38:30,974 --> 00:38:35,879
See, "excusable" is a lawful act
with no intention to kill.

00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:39,616
"Justifiable" means that the
action was the only alternative.

00:38:39,683 --> 00:38:41,718
That's what they
should have found.

00:38:41,785 --> 00:38:43,453
It's okay.

00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,922
I think they may
have it right.

00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:48,391
Look, look, I got nothing
against Mr. Sanders personally,

00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:51,928
but all these inquests
ever really seem to do
is protect the cops.

00:38:51,995 --> 00:38:54,397
I'm just trying to speak
for someone who can't
speak for himself.

00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,899
We should be in
a criminal court...

00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:59,136
...about any death
at the hands of law enforcement.

00:38:59,202 --> 00:39:00,804
The rights of the
working people of...

00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:02,839
Things have a way of
working themselves out.

00:39:02,906 --> 00:39:05,542
Mr. Sanders, Mr. Sanders, do you
think the verdict was fair?

00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:07,978
Was your killing Demitrius James
excusable?

00:39:10,013 --> 00:39:12,749
This kid saved
my damn life.

00:39:12,816 --> 00:39:16,720
He is a hero,
a genuine hero.

00:39:16,786 --> 00:39:19,022

Penny Garden was poisoned
with nicotine.

00:40:39,903 --> 00:40:41,972
Well, that's not exactly
a surprise--

00:40:42,038 --> 00:40:43,874
the woman smoked
liked a chimney.

00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,208
She didn't smoke it.

00:40:45,275 --> 00:40:46,510
She drank it.

00:40:46,576 --> 00:40:48,245
Liquid nicotine.

00:40:48,311 --> 00:40:50,680
Truman Capote used it
as a murder weapon

00:40:50,747 --> 00:40:52,949
in his story,
"Hand-Carved Coffins,"

00:40:53,016 --> 00:40:56,887
and our killer put it
in Aunt Penny's liqueur bottle.

<i>...and evidently, mess up</i>
<i>a meticulously crafted murder.</i>

00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:24,714
That's why the miniature wasn't
at the crime scene.

00:41:24,781 --> 00:41:27,117
The killer was compelled
to fix it,

00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:29,553
so that it would match
what actually happened.

00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:39,095
Liquid nicotine is in a lot
of smoking cessation products.

00:41:39,162 --> 00:41:43,300
Yeah. Commonly available
to just about anyone.

00:41:43,366 --> 00:41:45,602
Any luck with
the vic's calls?

00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,238
Kind of. I data-mined
the home phone numbers

00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:50,106
of Izzy Delancy
and Penny Garden.

00:41:50,173 --> 00:41:52,309
They actually had ten
numbers in common.

00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:53,777
Information,

00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:57,280
couple of mail-order catalogs,
power company, Moviefone.

00:41:57,347 --> 00:41:59,749
There's one other number
which turned out to be

00:41:59,816 --> 00:42:01,952
an untraceable
disposable cell phone--

00:42:02,018 --> 00:42:04,654
suggests someone who
doesn't want to be found.

00:42:04,721 --> 00:42:06,556
SANDERS:
Hey, boss,

00:42:06,623 --> 00:42:08,625
unless you need me for
something, I'm gonna take off.

00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,094
Yeah. Take off that suit, too.

00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:14,264
And Greg...

00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,966
you did a good job.

00:42:16,032 --> 00:42:19,002
I'm glad you think so.

00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:33,283

00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,446
What is it, Archie?

00:43:03,513 --> 00:43:04,614
Oh, hey, Gris.

00:43:04,681 --> 00:43:06,483
I was just looking
at footage

00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,517
from the next-door
neighbor's,

00:43:07,584 --> 00:43:09,519
the night the package
was delivered.

00:43:09,586 --> 00:43:11,388
(tapping keys)

00:43:11,454 --> 00:43:13,924
Never underestimate
the Neighborhood Watch.

00:43:16,593 --> 00:43:19,863
I don't see a delivery truck.

00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,733
Well, fortunately for us,
this was a <i>personal delivery...</i>

00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,803
right to our front door.
