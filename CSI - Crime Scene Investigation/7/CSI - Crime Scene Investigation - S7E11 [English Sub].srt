00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:14,270
(creaking)

00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:20,309
(TV playing indistinctly)

00:00:20,376 --> 00:00:21,477
HOST:
...nice and hot, 'kay?

00:00:21,544 --> 00:00:25,481
And again, we always add
the salt and pepper.

00:00:25,548 --> 00:00:27,316
(static crackles)

00:00:27,383 --> 00:00:28,751
(mutters):
Piece of crap.

00:00:28,818 --> 00:00:31,687
...hits the pan and you want to
listen for that sound.

00:00:31,754 --> 00:00:34,123
That is the most
important sound.
(creaks)

00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,624
Jay?

00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:37,793
Is that you?

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,128
...next we're gonna add
the tomatoes,

00:00:39,195 --> 00:00:40,696
which sometimes
have enough sugar,

00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:42,898
but really when you've got
the natural sugar...

00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:54,877
(groaning)

00:00:54,944 --> 00:00:57,546
HOST:
...tomatoes, some tomato juice.

00:00:57,613 --> 00:00:59,915
Now if you don't... if tomatoes
aren't in season,

00:00:59,982 --> 00:01:02,718
they're not really...

00:01:02,785 --> 00:01:04,320
WILLOWS:
<i>CSI processed the knife</i>

00:01:04,387 --> 00:01:06,856
<i>and found blood from</i>
<i>four different sources,</i>

00:01:06,922 --> 00:01:11,427
three of which were intermingled
together on the blade.

00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:14,063
One matched Addie Finch,
the victim.

00:01:16,132 --> 00:01:19,201
The other two were also female.

00:01:19,268 --> 00:01:22,705
And based on the number of
DNA markers they have in common,

00:01:22,772 --> 00:01:24,340
they're either sisters
or mother and daughter.

00:01:24,407 --> 00:01:26,075
They are not related
to Addie Finch.

00:01:26,142 --> 00:01:27,309
And both remain unidentified.

00:01:27,376 --> 00:01:29,378
And the fourth DNA source?

00:01:29,445 --> 00:01:33,315
When I disassembled the knife,
I found blood on the tang,

00:01:33,382 --> 00:01:37,486
which is the steel area
under the handle.

00:01:37,553 --> 00:01:39,388
Were you able
to identify this DNA?

00:01:39,455 --> 00:01:43,459
It was a match to the victim's
son, Jay Gregory Finch.

00:01:43,526 --> 00:01:44,593
The defendant.

00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,761
That's right.

00:01:45,828 --> 00:01:49,131
JUDGE HYAK:
Cross-examination,
Mr. Novak?

00:01:49,198 --> 00:01:51,867
Did you recover the knife
from the scene three years ago?

00:01:51,934 --> 00:01:54,437
No, the defendant
turned it in to P.D.

00:01:54,503 --> 00:01:56,839
A man comes home...
only to find his mother

00:01:56,906 --> 00:01:59,442
bleeding on the floor,
a knife stuck in her chest.

00:01:59,508 --> 00:02:03,045
In a desperate attempt
to save her life,

00:02:03,112 --> 00:02:04,914
he removes the knife
from her chest.

00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,449
But it's too late.

00:02:06,515 --> 00:02:08,617
He takes the knife in question
to the authorities,

00:02:08,684 --> 00:02:10,286
cooperates with
their investigation,

00:02:10,353 --> 00:02:12,021
and then you charge him
with murder.

00:02:12,088 --> 00:02:13,856
The defendant did not
call for help,

00:02:13,923 --> 00:02:16,058
and he waited five days
to turn it in.

00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,560
He was in shock.

00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:19,895
You found two unknown sources
of blood on that knife.

00:02:19,962 --> 00:02:22,264
Isn't it possible
that one or both of them
killed Addie Finch?

00:02:22,331 --> 00:02:23,399
Objection.
Speculative.

00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:24,734
I'll allow it.

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,203
It's possible.

00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:29,038
However, Mr. Finch's blood

00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:31,140
was found isolated
near the handle.

00:02:31,207 --> 00:02:33,042
Stabbing is a messy business.

00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:34,944
I believe that Mr. Finch
cut himself...

00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:37,113
You've been warned about
speculation, Ms. Willows.

00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:38,647
It's not speculation.

00:02:38,714 --> 00:02:40,883
From his birth until
the time of his mother's death,

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,386
Mr. Finch lived in that house.

00:02:43,452 --> 00:02:44,720
Isn't it equally possible
he cut himself

00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:46,188
on that knife
at a separate occasion?

00:02:46,255 --> 00:02:47,289
Yes, but...

00:02:47,356 --> 00:02:48,624
For the record,

00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:49,925
her answer was
"Yes, it's possible."

00:02:49,992 --> 00:02:52,595
No further questions.

00:02:54,463 --> 00:02:57,299
Though Addie Finch received
multiple stab wounds,

00:02:57,366 --> 00:02:59,769
the actual cause of death
was a gunshot wound.

00:02:59,835 --> 00:03:01,170
Isn't that correct?

00:03:01,237 --> 00:03:02,571
We believe that

00:03:02,638 --> 00:03:05,441
the defendant stabbed
his mother multiple times,

00:03:05,508 --> 00:03:06,509
stood over her while

00:03:06,575 --> 00:03:08,077
she was dying, and

00:03:08,144 --> 00:03:11,013
<i>shot her in the forehead</i>
<i>to complete the act.</i>

00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,349
You recovered a bullet
from Ms. Finch's body.

00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,017
Did you also recover a gun?

00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:16,419
No.

00:03:16,485 --> 00:03:17,453
So you have nothing with which

00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,689
to forensically match
the bullet?

00:03:19,755 --> 00:03:21,357
The bullet was a .38.

00:03:21,424 --> 00:03:23,993
The defendant's father,
who passed away

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,763
in 1989, was seen in
photographs holding a .38.

00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,498
We also found
an empty gun case

00:03:29,565 --> 00:03:31,000
in the defendant's closet,

00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:33,436
which tested positive
for chromium steel.

00:03:33,502 --> 00:03:36,038
My belt buckle is also
made of metal.

00:03:36,105 --> 00:03:38,708
If I kept it in a box, wouldn't
it also test positive?

00:03:38,774 --> 00:03:40,543
Do you keep it in
a velvet-lined gun box?

00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:43,179
No further questions.

00:03:45,514 --> 00:03:47,817
On the sole count of murder
in the first degree,

00:03:47,883 --> 00:03:51,020
we, the jury, find the
defendant, Jay Gregory Finch...

00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:52,355
not guilty.

00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:53,489
(gavel bangs)

00:03:58,861 --> 00:04:00,062
Thank you.

00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:01,897
Take care of yourself.

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,067
Quite the salesman,
Mr. Novak.

00:04:05,134 --> 00:04:06,268
Not a hard sell.

00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:07,970
Finch is guilty.

00:04:08,037 --> 00:04:09,638
You once said
the same about me.

00:04:09,705 --> 00:04:10,973
You were wrong then, too.

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,209
Yeah, you're not a murderer,
you just set them free.

BRASS:
Why didn't you bring
the knife directly to us?

00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,758
I get these
anxiety attacks...

00:04:53,824 --> 00:04:57,428
since I hit my head real bad
playing football my senior year.

00:04:57,495 --> 00:05:00,965
I get these brutal headaches.

00:05:01,032 --> 00:05:03,234
So, I climb into my car
and drive.

00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:05,403
Sometimes for days.

00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:07,805
It... it calms me.

00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:10,441
Mom and I took care
of each other.

00:05:10,508 --> 00:05:12,844
We were a good team.

00:05:14,145 --> 00:05:16,080
What a load of crap.

00:05:16,147 --> 00:05:18,883
We found his bags
packed near the door.

00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,118
Addie raised a momma's boy
and she'd finally had enough.

00:05:21,185 --> 00:05:23,120
She was kicking his ass out
and he snapped.

00:05:23,187 --> 00:05:24,322
Did Finch have
a history of violence?

00:05:24,388 --> 00:05:26,891
No, but his CT scan

00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,626
showed damage
to the amygdala

00:05:28,693 --> 00:05:30,061
and the frontal lobe.

00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:33,364
That kind of injury has been
known to change personality,

00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:35,633
to make a person more
inclined to violence.

00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,669
We need to ID his
other two victims.

00:05:38,736 --> 00:05:40,071
Charge Finch
with a new crime.

00:05:40,137 --> 00:05:41,105
No double jeopardy.

00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:42,573
We can even use
the knife again.

00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,208
Catherine, we tried
three years ago.

00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:45,743
There were no other
female related crimes

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,178
in the Vegas metro area
that week.

00:05:47,245 --> 00:05:48,679
He drove for five days, Nick.

00:05:48,746 --> 00:05:49,947
Yes, and as I recall,

00:05:50,014 --> 00:05:52,683
we put out a broadcast
covering cities statewide.

00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,086
But not to any of
the small towns in between.

00:05:55,152 --> 00:05:56,754
They aren't connected
to a central network.

00:05:56,821 --> 00:05:58,523
Needle in a haystack.

00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:01,559
It's our job to find
a needle in a haystack.

00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,602
How did you know about this?

00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:14,005
I saw an approved leave of
absence form on Ecklie's desk.

00:06:14,071 --> 00:06:16,274
Don't worry, I didn't say
anything to anyone else.

00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,542
Did you think
that you were going to

00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:19,210
teach at my alma mater
in the dead of winter

00:06:19,277 --> 00:06:20,545
without warm clothes?

00:06:20,611 --> 00:06:22,513
I thought you went to college
in San Diego.

00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,881
Graduate school.

00:06:23,948 --> 00:06:26,017
Undergraduate was
all about the Bay State.

00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,687
Crazy times, my friend,
crazy times.

00:06:29,754 --> 00:06:31,789
Those Hampshire girls
down in Amherst?

00:06:31,856 --> 00:06:33,224
Insane.

00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,525
Thank you.

00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:36,561
You're welcome.

00:06:38,796 --> 00:06:39,931
What are you teaching?

00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:44,468
The seasonal fluctuations

00:06:44,535 --> 00:06:46,504
in observed behaviors

00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:48,840
of the Walden Pond
swamp mosquito.

00:06:48,906 --> 00:06:50,875
Excellent.

00:06:50,942 --> 00:06:53,911
I don't know what college
was like for you,

00:06:53,978 --> 00:06:56,214
but for me it was
a new beginning,

00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,716
a chance to
reinvent myself.

00:06:58,783 --> 00:07:01,385
For the first time in my
life, I felt like I fit in.

00:07:01,452 --> 00:07:03,154
Not like now.

00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:04,222
I mean...

00:07:04,288 --> 00:07:06,490
you and I are close,

00:07:06,557 --> 00:07:08,492
but sometimes I just don't
think the others get me.

00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:09,827
WILLOWS (knocks):
You got a second?

00:07:09,894 --> 00:07:10,928
He's kind of busy.

00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,165
Oh.

00:07:14,232 --> 00:07:17,568
When you get a chance,
hit the Purple Pint.

00:07:17,635 --> 00:07:18,903
Ask for Cookie.

00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,171
Tell her Davey Hodges
sent you.

00:07:20,238 --> 00:07:21,339
Drinks'll be on the house.

00:07:21,405 --> 00:07:23,241
Crazy times.

00:07:23,307 --> 00:07:25,343
Yeah.

00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:31,182
Jay Finch got an oil change the
day that he killed his mother.

00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:34,185
We compared the odometer reading
on the work order

00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:37,121
against what it read
when we impounded his car.

00:07:37,188 --> 00:07:38,823
The difference
was 350 miles.

00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,825
We used that to create
a search radius.

00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:43,227
Nick and I just spent
six hours on the phone with

00:07:43,294 --> 00:07:45,863
sheriffs in every county
inside that area.

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,399
There was one unsolved case
that matched our criteria

00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:49,901
in Larkston.

00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:52,236
A Laura Montoya and her
12-year-old daughter,

00:07:52,303 --> 00:07:53,237
Robyn.

00:07:53,304 --> 00:07:54,539
Why are we talking about this?

00:07:54,605 --> 00:07:55,907
Finch got off, didn't he?

00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:57,542
And I don't buy it.
I need to go to Larkston.

00:07:57,608 --> 00:07:58,743
You can't.

00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:00,845
Look, I want a second shot
at this guy.

00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:02,713
I want to get him
before he kills again.

00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,615
I'm going on sabbatical.

00:08:04,682 --> 00:08:07,952
You're gonna be the acting
supervisor while I'm gone.

00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:10,588
When are you leaving?

00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:12,156
Tomorrow night.

00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,027
I'll be back before then.

00:08:17,261 --> 00:08:18,829
How long have you
known about this?

00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:33,477
(garbled police dispatches)

00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:39,517
Need a vacation?

00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:41,919
I guess I should be grateful
you didn't stop by my house.

00:08:41,986 --> 00:08:43,821
And get a gun in my face?
No, thank you.

00:08:43,888 --> 00:08:44,922
I can take a hint.

00:08:44,989 --> 00:08:48,192
What do you want?

00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:49,927
I'm here waving a white flag.

00:08:49,994 --> 00:08:52,463
Look, I owe you
an apology.

00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,665
I regret the way I've behaved
toward you in the past.

00:08:54,732 --> 00:08:59,770
I've sobered up, and
I want to make amends.

00:08:59,837 --> 00:09:01,806
Climbing the 12 Steps.

00:09:01,873 --> 00:09:03,374
Got a few more to go.

00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:04,976
Well, you can check me
off the list.

00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:08,012
Thank you for stopping by.

00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:12,650
Hey...

00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:14,685
which pissed
you off more,

00:09:14,752 --> 00:09:17,288
that Finch went free
or that I won?

00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:19,156
I'm 50-50.

00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:23,828
There's still
hope for me.

00:09:28,065 --> 00:09:29,333
You all right?

00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,035
Perfect timing.

00:09:31,102 --> 00:09:32,103
Let's go.

00:09:34,238 --> 00:09:37,241
♪ ♪

00:09:53,424 --> 00:09:55,927
STOKES:
<i>Sabbatical's usually</i>
<i>a euphemism for "sayonara."</i>

00:09:55,993 --> 00:09:58,529
I don't think Grissom's
coming back.

00:09:58,596 --> 00:09:59,730
Why wouldn't he?

00:09:59,797 --> 00:10:02,133
I don't know,
he shaved his beard,

00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,434
he's lost a little weight,

00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:04,902
he's been leaving
when shift is over.

00:10:04,969 --> 00:10:07,238
I think he even took a day off
last week.

00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:09,240
Maybe he's got himself
a girlfriend.

00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:10,608
That's what I'm saying.

00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:12,577
You know, I thought you were

00:10:12,643 --> 00:10:14,045
going to leave
a few months ago.

00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:15,880
Why, 'cause I shaved my beard?

00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:17,415
(laughing)

00:10:17,481 --> 00:10:19,050
No, I mean, I...

00:10:19,116 --> 00:10:20,852
you don't really
have to work anymore

00:10:20,918 --> 00:10:22,386
if you don't want to, right?

00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:23,588
What are you talking about?

00:10:23,654 --> 00:10:26,557
Well... Sam, with your dad...

00:10:26,624 --> 00:10:27,592
the whole thing.

00:10:27,658 --> 00:10:29,060
Oh, is that what people think?

00:10:29,126 --> 00:10:31,863
That daddy's little girl
got herself a big inheritance?

00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:33,598
Well, let me tell
you something, Nicky.

00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:36,501
All of Sam's money is tied up
in a big hole in the ground

00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:38,636
on a very nice piece
of Strip real estate,

00:10:38,703 --> 00:10:41,572
but I got no dog
in that fight.

00:10:57,822 --> 00:11:00,825
Now you guys aren't here
to make me look bad, are you?

00:11:00,892 --> 00:11:03,160
No.
Just busting chops.

00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:04,795
Sheriff Beth McGuire.

00:11:04,862 --> 00:11:06,264
Nick Stokes.
Nice to meet you.

00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,932
Catherine Willows.
Nice to meet you.
Hi.

00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:09,767
I just read that file
that you sent over.

00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:14,639
Jay Finch, he looks like
a real son of a bitch.

00:11:14,705 --> 00:11:17,742
Laura Montoya, she was
a good friend of mine.

00:11:17,808 --> 00:11:19,710
So, uh...
hey, Ronnie.

00:11:19,777 --> 00:11:21,112
How you doing?

00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:23,948
I would really be happy
to see this case solved.

00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:25,816
Yeah, as would we.

00:11:25,883 --> 00:11:29,353
Why don't you... run us
through it, Sheriff?

00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,289
Okay. Uh...

00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:32,957
Laura...

00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:35,693
and her daughter
were right... here

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,262
eating burgers and
drinking shakes.

00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:40,198
They were the last
customers of the night.

00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:42,867
<i>Jake Hanson closed up,</i>

00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:44,168
<i>and then he left</i>

00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:45,837
<i>and they were still</i>
<i>right here, eating.</i>

00:11:45,903 --> 00:11:46,838
I'm heading home, girls.

00:11:46,904 --> 00:11:49,307
Don't you stay all night.

00:11:49,373 --> 00:11:50,641
Stay hi to
your mom, Jake.

00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,543
And I was called
about 10:00 p.m.

00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,845
Couple of local
skateboarders.

00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:55,847
They saw the blood
and they just, you know,

00:11:55,913 --> 00:11:56,714
called it in.

00:11:56,781 --> 00:11:57,648
No bodies?

00:11:57,715 --> 00:12:01,052
No. Just a
blood pool...

00:12:01,118 --> 00:12:02,587
here.

00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:05,189
I found some blood
drops leading out

00:12:05,256 --> 00:12:07,792
through the parking lot
towards the main road.

00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:08,960
Abduction?

00:12:09,026 --> 00:12:09,961
I don't know.

00:12:10,027 --> 00:12:12,263
One minute, my best friend

00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,266
is just having an Oreo
smoothie with her kid,

00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,835
and then the next minute
all I got is blood drops.

00:12:17,902 --> 00:12:20,338
Did you identify who
the blood belonged to?

00:12:20,404 --> 00:12:21,973
We sent a sample
to the Reno Lab.

00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,241
Came back a match to Laura.

00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:24,642
Mother's the
bigger threat.

00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:26,010
Probably took
her out first.

00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:27,278
And once she was injured,

00:12:27,345 --> 00:12:29,514
the daughter got
scared into compliance.

00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,150
Any idea on the mode of death?

00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:36,187
Well, I know your guy
used a knife and a gun,

00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:37,522
but I didn't
recover any weapons.

00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:40,057
We're gonna need a blood sample
to compare to our knife.

00:12:40,124 --> 00:12:42,527
I-I got that back in the
fridge at the station.

00:12:42,593 --> 00:12:43,861
You know, there <i>are</i>

00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:46,264
quite a few nicks
in the pavement down here.

00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,966
So if Laura was
seated here...

00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:51,102
the shooter
would've had to

00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:54,438
aim downward
to impact the asphalt.

00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:57,742
Then this would have been
the trajectory of the bullet.

00:12:57,808 --> 00:12:59,944
Now, there's what appears to be

00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:02,947
a ricochet mark headed
in the right direction.

00:13:03,014 --> 00:13:05,750
Killer shoots Laura
from behind...

00:13:05,816 --> 00:13:07,585
(gunshot)

00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:11,055
Wait a minute.

00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:22,633
Oh, yeah.

00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,302
I think we're
in business, ladies.

00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:49,526
Hey, Gris.

00:13:49,593 --> 00:13:51,695
So, uh, Hodges tells me

00:13:51,762 --> 00:13:53,731
you're flying the coop.

00:13:53,797 --> 00:13:55,399
What's the matter, you
sick of baby-sitting?

00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:56,734
Just the opposite.

00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,535
I'm a teacher
without any students.

00:13:58,602 --> 00:14:01,005
I've still got a lot to learn.

00:14:01,071 --> 00:14:03,774
Besides, having you around kinda
keeps me honest.

00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:06,410
Whether you know it or not,
you're the rock of my team.

00:14:06,477 --> 00:14:08,946
Catherine's going to be
in charge for a while

00:14:09,013 --> 00:14:10,014
while I'm gone.

00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,949
Be there for her
like you've been

00:14:12,016 --> 00:14:13,550
there for me
and we'll all be fine.

00:14:13,617 --> 00:14:15,819
Thanks. It means a lot.

00:14:15,886 --> 00:14:17,154
You know I got you covered.

00:14:18,656 --> 00:14:20,858
What, are you sending
those to the... the Louvre?

00:14:20,924 --> 00:14:24,662
Ernie Dell did kill
with an artistic touch.

00:14:36,907 --> 00:14:39,243
.25 caliber.

00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,511
Finch used a .38.

00:14:42,112 --> 00:14:43,747
No dice, huh?

00:14:43,814 --> 00:14:45,582
Finch could've used
a different gun,

00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:48,385
but chances are, yeah,
they're unrelated.

00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:49,887
When you guys called, I...

00:14:49,954 --> 00:14:52,923
I let myself believe
that Laura was still alive.

00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:58,696
Well, now, I'm, I'm just
gonna pray that she's dead.

00:14:58,762 --> 00:15:01,899
I just don't want to think
about the alternative.

00:15:01,966 --> 00:15:03,968
Thank you
for your help, Beth.

00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:05,903
I gotta call her
sister in Denver.

00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,972
This'll be the second time
I've gotten her hopes up.

00:15:08,038 --> 00:15:09,974
There was a first time?

00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,275
Well, there was
a double murder

00:15:11,342 --> 00:15:12,676
the day after
Laura went missing.

00:15:12,743 --> 00:15:14,311
It was about 20 miles
outside of Larkston.

00:15:14,378 --> 00:15:17,715
A Mary Acheson
and her daughter,

00:15:17,781 --> 00:15:19,617
Heather Curtis.
At first, I,

00:15:19,683 --> 00:15:22,553
I thought it was related
to the disappearance

00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,421
of Robin and Laura,
but, but it wasn't.

00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:27,157
Why didn't you
tell us this before?

00:15:27,224 --> 00:15:28,826
It's a closed case.

00:15:28,892 --> 00:15:29,994
We got the guy.

00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,030
Robert Guffey.

00:15:33,097 --> 00:15:36,033
Okay... He's in, uh...

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,568
Carson City. He's doing

00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:41,038
a life term
in the Nevada state prison.

00:15:41,105 --> 00:15:44,775
Yeah. His bloody fingerprints
were all over the crime scene,

00:15:44,842 --> 00:15:47,678
<i>and</i> he confessed the next day.

00:15:47,745 --> 00:15:50,047
So you initially thought
that Guffey was also good

00:15:50,114 --> 00:15:52,516
for your friend Laura
and her daughter's abduction.

00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,651
What changed your mind?

00:15:53,717 --> 00:15:55,719
There was no
evidence to link him

00:15:55,786 --> 00:15:57,454
and he had an alibi.

00:15:57,521 --> 00:16:00,324
Plus, he would only admit to
Heather and Mary's murders.

00:16:00,391 --> 00:16:01,525
How'd he kill them?

00:16:01,592 --> 00:16:03,427
Stabbed, then shot.

00:16:03,494 --> 00:16:06,597
This is Heather Curtis.

00:16:06,664 --> 00:16:07,698
She and her husband lived

00:16:07,765 --> 00:16:10,868
with Mary Acheson,
her mother.

00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:12,036
So, uh...

00:16:12,102 --> 00:16:13,871
Shawn was at work,
and then he

00:16:13,938 --> 00:16:16,507
called home, and then
when nobody answered the phone,

00:16:16,573 --> 00:16:17,775
he knew that
something was wrong.

00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:19,610
So the son was home?

00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:21,078
He was hiding.

00:16:24,348 --> 00:16:26,850
That. That's Robert Guffey.

00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:27,885
So Guffey knew the victims?

00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:29,820
He was their plumber.

00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:31,021
Yeah. Old house,

00:16:31,088 --> 00:16:32,356
bad pipes.

00:16:32,423 --> 00:16:33,724
Oh, he was there <i>all</i> the time.

00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,725
Says here he has

00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:35,726
a history of violence.

00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:36,827
Beat his girlfriend.

00:16:36,894 --> 00:16:38,362
Oh, yeah, and his ex-wife

00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:39,697
has a T.R.O. against him.

00:16:39,763 --> 00:16:41,231
But this is
his very first murder.

00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:43,901
Unless, of course,
he killed Addie Finch first.

00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:46,637
So maybe you're looking

00:16:46,704 --> 00:16:47,571
for <i>my</i> guy.

00:16:52,776 --> 00:16:54,712
Was Guffey in Vegas that week?

00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:56,714
I don't know.

00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,748
I didn't ask him.

00:16:57,815 --> 00:16:59,083
Did you recover a handgun?

00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:00,651
Yeah. Oh, yeah, at his house.

00:17:00,718 --> 00:17:02,553
It was a .38,
same caliber as your case.

00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,989
But you couldn't match
the bullets to it?

00:17:05,055 --> 00:17:07,224
Reno Lab said that the
bullets were too damaged,

00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,760
you know, from bouncing around
inside the victims' skulls

00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:12,529
so they just couldn't get
any kind of comparison at all.

00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:14,665
I'm assuming you have the blood
samples from the two victims?

00:17:14,732 --> 00:17:16,200
They're at the Reno Lab,

00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:19,336
but, uh...
I can do you one better.

00:17:19,403 --> 00:17:21,905
You can take your own samples.

00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,418
Just a sec,
I'm gonna open this thing.

00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:39,189
You thinking what
I'm thinking?

00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:40,991
Looks like Addie
Finch's house.

00:17:43,594 --> 00:17:45,896
Danny and Shawn got
an apartment in town.

00:17:45,963 --> 00:17:48,098
They've never been back here.

00:17:48,165 --> 00:17:54,338
And Shawn, he can't quite bring
himself to sell the place.

00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:57,374
So, nothing inside's been
touched in three years?

00:17:57,441 --> 00:18:01,512
Nope. This door
is a time machine.

00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,485
This blood pool
belongs to Mary,

00:18:08,552 --> 00:18:09,820
the mom.

00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:12,089
And, uh...
this blood

00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:15,592
down here belongs to
Heather, the daughter.

00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:17,995
Screen door's ripped.

00:18:18,062 --> 00:18:19,396
Must have been a struggle.

00:18:19,463 --> 00:18:22,266
We printed it,
only got smeared partials.

00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,435
Mary answers the door.

00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:26,637
The killer forces
his way in...

00:18:26,704 --> 00:18:27,805
stabs her.

00:18:30,207 --> 00:18:32,209
(groaning)

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,848
Heather comes to

00:18:37,915 --> 00:18:38,849
her mother's aid.

00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:39,917
Mom?

00:18:42,486 --> 00:18:44,688
<i>Gets stabbed herself.</i>

00:18:46,223 --> 00:18:47,925
(screaming)

00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:53,464
And flees to the kitchen.

00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:57,434
The killer finishes Mary off

00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:59,136
and hunts Heather down.

00:18:59,203 --> 00:19:01,939
He catches up
with Heather

00:19:02,006 --> 00:19:05,109
and executes her as well.

00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:09,146
(gunshot)

00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:11,982
This is where we found Danny.

00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:14,218
Poor little guy
had peed in his pants.

00:19:14,285 --> 00:19:16,553
He wouldn't come out
to anybody but his dad.

00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,657
Is this the phone that you
pulled Guffey's prints from?

00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:21,325
Uh... yeah.

00:19:21,392 --> 00:19:22,793
Guffey admitted

00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,662
to having made
an anonymous

00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:26,030
911 call
from the house

00:19:26,096 --> 00:19:28,799
at 3:20 p.m.

00:19:28,866 --> 00:19:31,502
And he didn't stick around.

00:19:32,903 --> 00:19:34,505
Whose blood on
the door handle?

00:19:34,571 --> 00:19:35,673
Oh, we tested it.

00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:37,308
That's a mixture
of the victims'.

00:19:37,374 --> 00:19:39,810
I think whoever did
this might have seen

00:19:39,877 --> 00:19:42,012
Danny's toys
in the backyard,

00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:43,714
thought the job
wasn't done yet...

00:19:43,781 --> 00:19:47,217
and went outside
to finish it.

00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:21,452
(thumps wood)

00:20:39,203 --> 00:20:40,371
(gunshots)

00:20:40,437 --> 00:20:42,072
He shot the rabbits.

00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:43,607
I believe
that Guffey thought

00:20:43,674 --> 00:20:44,908
that Danny was inside.

00:20:44,975 --> 00:20:46,076
We got a confession.

00:20:46,143 --> 00:20:47,611
We didn't need
those bullets,

00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:48,779
so we didn't
collect them.

00:20:51,148 --> 00:20:53,117
So we found one bullet
in Addie Finch,

00:20:53,183 --> 00:20:55,352
you found one in
Mary, one in Heather.

00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:57,354
There was three
in this hutch.

00:20:57,421 --> 00:20:59,923
If all these bullets were
shot from the same .38,

00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,358
six would kick it.

00:21:01,425 --> 00:21:03,127
Three murders,

00:21:03,193 --> 00:21:05,296
one gun, one killer.

00:21:05,362 --> 00:21:07,097
But was it Guffey,
or was it Finch?

00:21:07,164 --> 00:21:09,133
Well, these bullets should
answer that question.

00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:10,200

There's enough here
for a comparison.

00:22:03,018 --> 00:22:05,420
Good. Good, if it
matches Guffey's gun,

00:22:05,487 --> 00:22:06,588
he stays in prison,

00:22:06,655 --> 00:22:08,056
but if it doesn't,

00:22:08,123 --> 00:22:09,791

Hey, how's it going
on your civil case?

00:22:27,876 --> 00:22:29,244
Did you get a lawyer?

00:22:29,311 --> 00:22:31,413
LVPD said they'll provide me

Well, are you gonna
give me a raise?

00:22:36,618 --> 00:22:38,620
Because otherwise,
I can't afford that.

00:22:38,687 --> 00:22:41,757
Call the PPACE,
talk to your union rep.

00:22:41,824 --> 00:22:44,293
This was
an on-duty incident.

00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:45,928
They'll provide you

"The best I ever had."

00:24:17,252 --> 00:24:19,988
There was a murder
that was committed in Vegas

00:24:20,055 --> 00:24:21,590
two days before the

00:24:21,657 --> 00:24:23,659
Acheson-Curtis murders.

00:24:23,725 --> 00:24:25,093
I think the same person
committed both crimes

00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,261
and I think that person is you.

00:24:30,232 --> 00:24:32,267
Mr. Guffey, this is how
this is going to work.

00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:35,904
Every time you answer
one of my questions,

00:24:35,971 --> 00:24:37,940
I unbutton a button.

00:24:39,775 --> 00:24:41,009
(chuckles)

00:24:41,076 --> 00:24:43,045
Does that count as a question?

00:24:48,684 --> 00:24:50,085
You recognize this woman?

00:24:50,152 --> 00:24:52,488
Nope.

00:24:56,825 --> 00:24:57,860
That's it.

00:24:57,926 --> 00:24:59,628
Playing ball.

00:25:02,898 --> 00:25:05,501
Why did you kill Mary Acheson
and Heather Curtis?

00:25:08,036 --> 00:25:10,472
Ah, 'cause sometimes
women get killed.

00:25:12,975 --> 00:25:13,909
Oh,

00:25:13,976 --> 00:25:15,444
don't be like that.

00:25:15,511 --> 00:25:17,412
Well, that wasn't an answer.

00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:19,715
It was enough
for those other cops.

00:25:19,781 --> 00:25:20,649
What's that supposed to mean?

00:25:20,716 --> 00:25:24,953
That, uh, means I didn't do it.

00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,555
Well, then why did you confess?

00:25:26,622 --> 00:25:28,123
They had me

00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,493
in a room for 12 hours...

00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:37,032
no food, no water, no sleep.

00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:40,235
I had to beg
to use the bathroom.

00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:42,604
So now you're claiming
you were coerced.

00:25:42,671 --> 00:25:46,108
I've been claiming that
since day one.

00:25:46,175 --> 00:25:48,277
I recanted
the next morning.

00:25:48,343 --> 00:25:49,812
Button.

00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,322
That bitch cop...

00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:02,524
grabs my arm,

00:26:02,591 --> 00:26:06,328
points to this vein and says,

00:26:06,395 --> 00:26:09,531
"That's where
the needle will go

00:26:09,598 --> 00:26:13,202
when they put you down
like the dog you are."

00:26:13,268 --> 00:26:16,405
If I wanted to avoid the death
penalty, all I had to tell her

00:26:16,472 --> 00:26:20,175
was what she and-and-and her
deputies

00:26:20,242 --> 00:26:21,577
wanted to hear.

00:26:23,946 --> 00:26:25,981
That's worth two.

00:26:26,048 --> 00:26:29,351
Just pace yourself.

00:26:33,121 --> 00:26:34,223
How come your prints

00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:36,124

00:26:36,191 --> 00:26:38,694
Front door was open...

00:27:12,895 --> 00:27:14,696
my girlfriend before that.

00:27:14,763 --> 00:27:16,064

00:29:32,768 --> 00:29:36,672
Did anything unorthodox happen
during his interrogation?

00:29:36,738 --> 00:29:41,510
What is your point, Catherine?

00:29:41,577 --> 00:29:43,212
Did you ever do an interrogation
tired, Beth?

00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:46,515
Use your frustration,
snap at the suspect

00:29:46,582 --> 00:29:47,916
just so you can go home?

00:29:47,983 --> 00:29:49,885
Use all that edge
to get a confession?

00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:53,555
Am <i>I</i> being interrogated now?

00:29:53,622 --> 00:29:55,991
You questioned Robert Guffey
the exact week your best friend

00:29:56,058 --> 00:29:58,260
and her daughter
disappeared.

00:29:58,327 --> 00:30:01,830
That's not just edge,
that's a whole blade.

00:30:01,897 --> 00:30:04,933
I was sure Guffey was guilty
till you showed up.

00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,536
Who admits to a crime
he didn't commit?

00:30:07,603 --> 00:30:08,537
Who does that?

00:30:08,604 --> 00:30:10,606
People under duress.

00:30:10,672 --> 00:30:13,909
You come into this town,
you make me wrong,

00:30:13,976 --> 00:30:16,111
and then you go ride off
into the sunset.

00:30:16,178 --> 00:30:17,513
And where does that leave me?

00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:19,781
With the opportunity
to right a wrong.

00:30:21,783 --> 00:30:23,886
Sir, someone will be with you...
Look, I already
told you, babe,

00:30:23,952 --> 00:30:24,887
I ain't going anywhere.

00:30:24,953 --> 00:30:26,421
So unless you want
to have a really

00:30:26,488 --> 00:30:28,924
screwed-up day,
I suggest you get
her down here now.

00:30:28,991 --> 00:30:30,192
Mr. Novak.

00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:31,260
Where's Willows?

00:30:31,326 --> 00:30:32,261
Out.

00:30:32,327 --> 00:30:33,428
How can I help you?

00:30:33,495 --> 00:30:35,297
Why the hell is this department
tailing my client?

00:30:35,364 --> 00:30:36,932
Concern for his safety?

00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:37,966
That's cute.

00:30:38,033 --> 00:30:39,635
Jay Finch was acquitted
of his mother's murder.

00:30:39,701 --> 00:30:41,236
He deserves all the rights
of a free man.

00:30:41,303 --> 00:30:43,238
With all due respect,

00:30:43,305 --> 00:30:45,707
Mr. Novak, no laws
have been broken here.

00:30:45,774 --> 00:30:48,043
You can't try Finch twice
for the same crime.

00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,311
No, but you can
for a different crime.

00:30:49,378 --> 00:30:50,879
Oh, I see.

00:30:50,946 --> 00:30:53,849
This is a personal vendetta
by CSI Willows.

00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:55,050
Personal to who?

00:30:55,117 --> 00:30:57,052
Me. She's a man-hater.

00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:58,821
No surprise,
but how long

00:30:58,887 --> 00:31:00,656
do we have to pay
for the sins of her father?

00:31:00,722 --> 00:31:02,758
You know, Catherine and I

00:31:02,825 --> 00:31:04,593
get along just great.

00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,328
Maybe it's you.

00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:12,468
Well, you tell Catherine she
continues badgering my client,

00:31:12,534 --> 00:31:13,635
I will file a claim

00:31:13,702 --> 00:31:15,070
with the Attorney General's
office for oppression

00:31:15,137 --> 00:31:17,339
under cover of law.

00:31:17,406 --> 00:31:19,508
Duly noted.

00:31:24,413 --> 00:31:25,781
What do you mean, he's innocent?

00:31:25,848 --> 00:31:26,815
He confessed.

00:31:26,882 --> 00:31:31,019
I screwed up, Shawn.

00:31:31,086 --> 00:31:33,088
He dragged their blood
through my house

00:31:33,155 --> 00:31:34,790
and took off.

00:31:34,857 --> 00:31:37,192
This is bull...

00:31:43,332 --> 00:31:45,267
I spent three years
trying to get those memories

00:31:45,334 --> 00:31:46,869
out of my head.

00:31:46,935 --> 00:31:49,104
Are you telling me

00:31:49,171 --> 00:31:51,039
it's gonna start
all over again?

00:31:51,106 --> 00:31:52,841
I get that.
I get that, Shawn.

00:31:52,908 --> 00:31:53,842
I really do.

00:31:53,909 --> 00:31:56,111
And I wouldn't drag you
and Danny out here

00:31:56,178 --> 00:31:58,213
if it weren't important.

00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,682
Guffey was in your house,
but probably after the fact.

00:32:00,749 --> 00:32:02,885
We believe we know
who actually committed
the crimes.

00:32:02,951 --> 00:32:04,186
And unless we find
the evidence

00:32:04,253 --> 00:32:07,122
that he was in there,
we'll never know for sure.

00:32:07,189 --> 00:32:09,191
Mr. Curtis, your son
was the only one

00:32:09,258 --> 00:32:11,126
that got out alive.
He may have seen something.

00:32:11,193 --> 00:32:14,129
I don't think
I can go in there.

00:32:14,196 --> 00:32:15,998
How can I ask my son to do it?

00:32:16,064 --> 00:32:17,566
May I ask him?

00:32:19,434 --> 00:32:21,103
Thank you.

00:32:23,005 --> 00:32:24,373
Hi, Danny.

00:32:24,439 --> 00:32:26,842
I'm Catherine.

00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:29,478
I'm trying to catch
the bad guy that
hurt your mom

00:32:29,545 --> 00:32:32,614
and your grandma,
and I could really
use your help.

00:32:36,552 --> 00:32:38,353
Do you think they're with God?

00:32:40,856 --> 00:32:42,357
What do you think?

00:32:42,424 --> 00:32:46,595
I think they're still in there.

00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:50,732
Why?

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,403
They're waiting to fly up
to heaven.

00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:57,739
What are they waiting for?

00:32:59,441 --> 00:33:02,244
For me to say good-bye.

00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,272
Come on, Dad.

00:33:49,525 --> 00:33:51,593
Mom had made cookies.

00:34:02,871 --> 00:34:05,140
(cookie jar mooing)

00:34:05,207 --> 00:34:08,544
HEATHER:
Danny, I can hear you.
Put the cookie back.

00:34:30,566 --> 00:34:32,901
I hid in here.

00:34:44,046 --> 00:34:46,582
He's a lot bigger now.

00:34:46,648 --> 00:34:48,383
Heather always said
he grew fast.

00:34:53,655 --> 00:34:56,492
Then there was someone
at the door.

00:34:56,558 --> 00:34:58,026
No!
MAN:
This is my house!

00:34:58,093 --> 00:34:59,995
HEATHER:
Mom, what's going on? Mom?

00:35:01,263 --> 00:35:03,365

00:35:03,432 --> 00:35:06,668

(cookie jar mooing)

00:35:34,863 --> 00:35:36,331
And then what happened, Danny?

00:35:36,398 --> 00:35:38,500
I heard him eat a cookie.

00:35:38,567 --> 00:35:42,237
Then he went out
the back door.

00:35:42,304 --> 00:35:44,706
I heard some more bangs.

00:35:44,773 --> 00:35:48,677
Thought he was gone,
and then he came back in

00:35:48,744 --> 00:35:51,413
through the front door,
called the police.

00:35:53,415 --> 00:35:54,783
Guffey.

00:36:02,491 --> 00:36:04,793
You did great, buddy.

00:36:20,609 --> 00:36:21,877

00:36:21,944 --> 00:36:24,213
Good-bye, baby.
