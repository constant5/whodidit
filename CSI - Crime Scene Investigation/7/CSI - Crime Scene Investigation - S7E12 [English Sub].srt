00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:43,895
I can't believe
that she was compliant.

00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:44,896
Thanks, Doc.

00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:46,064
You got it.

00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:54,672
(exhales)

00:12:54,739 --> 00:12:58,443
You ever see a cat playing
with a mouse?

00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:02,480
Point isn't to kill the mouse,
just keep the game going.

00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:04,582
I'm guessing you've got cats.

00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:08,820
No. I just like
the metaphor.

00:13:12,524 --> 00:13:16,261
Same game every time.

00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:19,564
Cat goes home, leaves
its kill on the doorstep.

00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:20,699
Our guy's done this before.

00:13:20,765 --> 00:13:21,933
I'm with you there.

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,902
What got our cat's attention
this time?

00:13:23,968 --> 00:13:26,071
Around puberty,

00:13:26,137 --> 00:13:31,076
most guys fixate on a particular
body type that turns them on.

00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:35,146
Tall, skinny, short, red hair.

00:13:35,213 --> 00:13:36,915
Whatever floats
your boat.

00:13:36,981 --> 00:13:38,016
It's imprinted.

00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,819
Hard to let go of.

00:13:40,885 --> 00:13:43,188
Okay.

00:13:43,254 --> 00:13:46,791
So we know what his type is

00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:48,960
and we know what he likes
to do with them.

00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:01,473
Okay, we've got three
that fit the type.

00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:03,375
The cases were
years apart.

00:14:03,441 --> 00:14:07,278
1999, 1989...

00:14:07,345 --> 00:14:09,681
and 1975.

00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:12,150
Let's bring up
their photographs.

00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:18,757
Look at the similarity
in the body positions.

00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,527
They look posed,

00:14:22,594 --> 00:14:25,029
almost as if
they were...

00:14:25,096 --> 00:14:26,931
waving good-bye.

00:14:56,913 --> 00:14:59,816
Jane Doe '99
was discovered naked

00:14:59,883 --> 00:15:01,151
in a stretch of dirt
off Paradise

00:15:01,217 --> 00:15:03,153
behind the old
Hotel Continental.

00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:05,021
Based on
the photos,

00:15:05,088 --> 00:15:08,725
her hair was matted with dirt,
which suggests that it was wet

00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:09,893
when she was dumped.

00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:12,629
It's likely
that her body was washed.

00:15:12,696 --> 00:15:15,465
That's consistent
with the latest victim.

00:15:15,532 --> 00:15:17,801
Any traces of alcohol
or cotton swabs?

00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:19,002
There's nothing indicated,

00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:21,071
but there's almost nothing
in this file.

00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:22,339
Based on T.O.D.,

00:15:22,405 --> 00:15:25,175
the body was found less
than four hours after death.

00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:27,010
Yet other
than a general canvass,

00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:29,012
not a single person
was interviewed.

00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:32,582
The homicide detective's summary
is less than a page.

00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:34,351
Sounds like shoddy police work.

00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:36,086
Sounds like no police work.

00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:37,320
After the autopsy,

00:15:37,387 --> 00:15:40,357
C.O.D. confirmed
asphyxiation by strangulation.

00:15:40,423 --> 00:15:44,327
There was absolutely
no follow-up whatsoever.

00:15:44,394 --> 00:15:47,197
Well, there was a follow-up
in spades on Jane Doe '89.

00:15:47,263 --> 00:15:50,100
She was found in a vacant lot
off 28th Street

00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,434
near Boulder Highway.

00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:52,836
Uh, stripped of her clothing.

00:15:52,902 --> 00:15:54,738
Like the others,
several peri-mortem bruises,

00:15:54,804 --> 00:15:58,041
but check out this hair.

00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:01,811
Yeah, it's crimped.

00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,346
I remember those days.

00:16:03,413 --> 00:16:05,882
There's no way that
style survives a shower.

00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:07,684
Killer didn't wash
that one down.

00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:10,053
Methods evolve.

00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,621
Practice makes perfect.

00:16:11,688 --> 00:16:14,557
Again, the cops didn't come up
with a single suspect.

00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:17,227
There were detailed sketches
of the crime scene,

00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:19,929
microscopy on errant hairs
and fibers,

00:16:19,996 --> 00:16:23,066
even ran the vic's prints
through WIN.

00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:25,802
'89... that database was
barely on the Internet.

00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:27,237
The guy that worked
on this case

00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:28,571
was very thorough.

00:16:28,638 --> 00:16:30,674
He just didn't close it.

00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:35,211
Okay, Jane Doe '75.

00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:38,381
Well...

00:16:38,448 --> 00:16:42,118
she was found in an alley off
of Bridger near Fremont Street.

00:16:42,185 --> 00:16:43,453
Based on the level of decomp,

00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,921
she'd been lying there
about two days

00:16:44,988 --> 00:16:47,057
before they found her.

00:16:47,123 --> 00:16:50,260
Only thing about this one is,
she had her clothes on.

00:16:52,062 --> 00:16:53,296
Might have been his first.

00:16:53,363 --> 00:16:55,065
Or maybe the first one found.

00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:58,501
Isolated contusions on her neck,
arms and shoulders.

00:16:59,302 --> 00:17:00,270
C.O.D. listed

00:17:00,337 --> 00:17:01,771
as heroin overdose.

00:17:01,838 --> 00:17:03,340
Junkies do bruise easily.

00:17:03,406 --> 00:17:06,676
And the "waving good-bye"
hand position is

00:17:06,743 --> 00:17:08,912
a natural way to fall.

00:17:08,978 --> 00:17:10,447
It's possible

00:17:10,513 --> 00:17:11,748
that this one is
a coincidence.

00:17:11,815 --> 00:17:13,650
It's not.

00:17:13,717 --> 00:17:14,784
How do you know?

00:17:14,851 --> 00:17:16,553
Because I do.

00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,988
This guy pays attention
to the details.

00:17:18,054 --> 00:17:19,856
Knows what he likes,
he doesn't mix it up.

00:17:19,923 --> 00:17:22,092
Thing that gets me is
the discipline, though.

00:17:22,158 --> 00:17:24,527
He's got a habit, but he seems
to be able to control it.

00:17:24,594 --> 00:17:26,429
Only needs to kill once
every ten years or so,

00:17:26,496 --> 00:17:28,832
and when he does,
he's got a type.

00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,334
Pretty but not pricey.

00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:33,003
And not likely to be missed.

00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:34,804
You're a CSI,
not a profiler.

00:17:34,871 --> 00:17:36,272
What's the difference?

00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:37,741
Evidence.

00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,342
I want leads and IDs.

00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:41,778
Follow up on
what you've got.

00:17:44,781 --> 00:17:47,050
MAN:
<i>When I left this place,</i>
<i>it was all grey walls</i>

00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:48,985
and cinder blocks.

00:17:51,454 --> 00:17:52,555
Very fancy.

00:17:52,622 --> 00:17:54,290
What made you
transfer to Henderson?

00:17:54,357 --> 00:17:56,726
Cost of living,
better commute.

00:17:56,793 --> 00:17:57,961
I socked away a few bucks,

00:17:58,028 --> 00:17:59,696
bought a nice place
in Green Valley.

00:17:59,763 --> 00:18:01,765
Ah, I take it you're a
shortcuts kind of guy.

00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,033
I guess you could say that.

00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:05,301
I like to get to the heart
of things right away.

00:18:05,368 --> 00:18:07,871
Any reason that you didn't get
to the heart of this?

00:18:07,937 --> 00:18:10,106
Whoa.

00:18:11,141 --> 00:18:13,576
October 17, 1999.

00:18:13,643 --> 00:18:15,011
You remember the date?

00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:16,546
Yeah.

00:18:16,613 --> 00:18:17,914
Why is that?

00:18:17,981 --> 00:18:19,382
Hey, I'm not sure
I like your tone.

00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:21,951
Answer the question, Detective.

00:18:22,986 --> 00:18:25,121
It's my son's birthday.

00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,190
Day I caught the case,
my wife went into labor.

00:18:27,257 --> 00:18:28,725
It was rough.

00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:30,260
There were complications.

00:18:30,327 --> 00:18:32,329
Anyway, I was out for weeks
taking care of her.

00:18:32,395 --> 00:18:34,297
Used up all my vacation time.

00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:37,200
When I got back, there were
a half dozen cases on my desk.

00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:38,902
My captain told me to let it go.

00:18:40,503 --> 00:18:43,440
Look.

00:18:43,506 --> 00:18:44,607
We canvassed the neighborhood.

00:18:44,674 --> 00:18:46,242
No name.

00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:48,545
She was homeless,
hooking for drug money.

00:18:48,611 --> 00:18:49,579
You do not know that.

00:18:49,646 --> 00:18:51,081
You didn't even ask for tox.

00:18:51,147 --> 00:18:52,515
We didn't need to do a test.

00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:54,451
We found her
at Paradise and Flamingo.

00:18:54,517 --> 00:18:56,586
What else
would she be doing there?

00:19:11,434 --> 00:19:13,370
Okay, here we are.

00:19:13,436 --> 00:19:17,040
Autopsy samples for Doe, Jane.

00:19:17,107 --> 00:19:19,609
99-103.

00:19:19,676 --> 00:19:22,012
Uh, most recent vic had
traces of E in her system.

00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,147
If this one does, too,
there might be a connection.

00:19:24,214 --> 00:19:26,216
To a drug dealer
from ten years ago?

00:19:26,282 --> 00:19:28,551
That's kind of weak.

00:19:28,618 --> 00:19:31,221
Weak is the best
that we have right now.

00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:45,235
SIDLE:
<i>Hodges ran the formalin-fixed</i>
<i>tissue sample</i>

00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:47,570
<i>from Jane Doe '99 through GCMS.</i>

00:19:47,637 --> 00:19:49,139
<i>There's no traces of Ecstasy,</i>

00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:52,442
<i>but he did find</i>
<i>chloral hydrate.</i>

00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:55,278
Chloral hydrate is
a hypnotic sedative.

00:19:55,345 --> 00:19:56,913
There were no traces
of anything like that

00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,549
found in Veronica Sorensen.

00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,584
Which means if our guy
still sedates his victims

00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:02,986
before sexually
asphyxiating them,

00:20:03,053 --> 00:20:07,357
whatever he's using now
isn't leaving a trace.

00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:20,036
Warrick Brown.

00:20:20,103 --> 00:20:21,538
Mike Keppler.

00:20:21,604 --> 00:20:22,839
I know...

00:20:22,906 --> 00:20:26,209
You trying to do a geographic
profile of your serial?

00:20:26,276 --> 00:20:30,146
Yeah, most of these guys tend
to operate out of one place.

00:20:30,213 --> 00:20:32,215
In theory,
as the killer gets

00:20:32,282 --> 00:20:34,284
more and more comfortable
with each act,

00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:36,619
the locations of the bodies
should spiral outward

00:20:36,686 --> 00:20:38,355
from one central point.

00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,393
I tell you one thing that your
dump sites do have in common.

00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,995
What's that?

00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:46,863
When the bodies were
found, the location
that they were found in

00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:50,700
at the time had the highest
crime rate in the city.

00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,142
Smart.

00:20:59,209 --> 00:21:01,144
The crime center
sure seems

00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:02,579
to move around pretty
quickly here, huh?

00:21:02,645 --> 00:21:03,847
Well, in Vegas,

00:21:03,913 --> 00:21:07,517
new is old in five years,
old is history in ten,

00:21:07,584 --> 00:21:09,686
and nothing ever
seems to leave a mark.

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,189
Sounds refreshing.

00:21:16,126 --> 00:21:18,862
STOKES:
'89 Jane Doe,
this was your case.

00:21:18,928 --> 00:21:21,231
One of the first
homicides I ever worked.

00:21:21,297 --> 00:21:23,633
Damn, I had good
handwriting.

00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,502
Excuse me.

00:21:25,568 --> 00:21:28,238
Come on, come on,
I know you got company.

00:21:28,304 --> 00:21:31,374
Yeah, that's it.

00:21:31,441 --> 00:21:32,442
Oh, man.

00:21:33,476 --> 00:21:35,378
You processed a mountain
of evidence

00:21:35,445 --> 00:21:37,380
but didn't turn up
a single suspect.

00:21:37,447 --> 00:21:39,449
It's not my
fault, man.

00:21:39,516 --> 00:21:41,117
I had the scumbag
dead to rights.

00:21:41,184 --> 00:21:42,519
What are you talking about?

00:21:42,585 --> 00:21:43,520
There's nothing here

00:21:43,586 --> 00:21:45,221
to indicate
that you...

00:21:46,656 --> 00:21:47,590
This is it.

00:21:47,657 --> 00:21:49,092
That's the killer's hair.

00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:51,528
You did note morphology
consistent with the vic.

00:21:51,594 --> 00:21:52,696
Yeah,

00:21:52,762 --> 00:21:55,432
but the position-
location was all wrong.

00:21:55,498 --> 00:21:58,134
I pulled that out of her
navel, just that one hair.

00:21:58,201 --> 00:21:59,169
It was a
sexual assault,

00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,804
It had to be
from the killer.

00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:08,778
But I couldn't prove it,
so... I didn't write it down.

00:22:08,845 --> 00:22:10,914
This hair had a tag.

I don't remember.

00:35:36,441 --> 00:35:39,444
But you can't go in there,
because he's with a patient.

00:35:41,546 --> 00:35:43,548
(knocking)

00:35:45,717 --> 00:35:46,885
Dr. Lowry,

00:35:46,952 --> 00:35:48,820
would you
please come with us?

00:35:50,856 --> 00:35:53,992
Euginia has been
seeing me for, um,

00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:55,627
how many years,
my dear?

00:35:55,694 --> 00:35:56,928
(grunting)

00:35:56,995 --> 00:35:58,196
(chuckling)

00:35:58,263 --> 00:36:01,533
I think it's much
longer than that.

00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,736
I'd like to finish Euginia up
before the Novocain wears off.

00:36:04,803 --> 00:36:06,605
We've got a court order

00:36:06,671 --> 00:36:08,473
to collect a bite impression
from you.

00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,410
Is this about these young girls?

00:36:11,476 --> 00:36:13,512
KEPPLER:
I think you know what
this is about, Dr. Lowry.

00:36:13,578 --> 00:36:16,148
You're gonna need to come down
to the crime lab with us.

00:36:16,214 --> 00:36:19,117
Bite impression.

00:36:19,184 --> 00:36:20,685
Couldn't we just do that here?

00:36:20,752 --> 00:36:22,888
It'll save us all
a lot of time and trouble,

00:36:22,954 --> 00:36:25,023
unless of course,

00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:29,394
embarrassing me in front of
my patient is your real intent.

00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:36,835
Fine.

00:36:36,902 --> 00:36:39,071
Okay. Euginia?

00:36:39,137 --> 00:36:40,272
(grunts)

00:36:40,338 --> 00:36:43,642
I'm going to have you
wait in Exam Four,

00:36:43,708 --> 00:36:45,911
and I'll be in there
in just a short while.

00:36:45,977 --> 00:36:48,280
(grunting)
No, come on,
let's go.

00:36:48,346 --> 00:36:49,915
Let's see, just...

00:36:49,981 --> 00:36:52,651
And you know the upper
right teeth we worked on?

00:36:52,717 --> 00:36:54,719
Well, they're looking fine.

00:37:02,294 --> 00:37:03,995
That's too much water.

00:37:04,062 --> 00:37:06,731
It will never set.

00:37:06,798 --> 00:37:10,535
We've got time.

00:37:10,602 --> 00:37:13,038
Young lady,
please, please, please,

00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,039
let me do this.

00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,540
I have much more practice.

00:37:15,607 --> 00:37:18,143
Be my guest.

00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,444
(chuckles)

00:37:21,446 --> 00:37:23,148
You know...

00:37:23,215 --> 00:37:26,485
I don't believe courts accept

00:37:26,551 --> 00:37:28,820
bite mark evidence much anymore.

00:37:28,887 --> 00:37:30,956
No, they'd much rather have

00:37:31,022 --> 00:37:34,593
DNA from saliva around a wound.

00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:36,762
I've gotten convictions
from bite marks.

00:37:36,828 --> 00:37:40,265
Not many, I suspect.

00:37:42,167 --> 00:37:45,370
Do you know
that our teeth

00:37:45,437 --> 00:37:47,038
continuously migrate

00:37:47,105 --> 00:37:48,774
through our entire life?

00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,376
(chuckles)

00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:54,146
Yes.

00:37:54,212 --> 00:37:55,580
Dental forensics

00:37:55,647 --> 00:37:58,650
is definitely
an inexact science.

00:38:25,243 --> 00:38:29,047
We could probably
match four out of six.

00:38:29,114 --> 00:38:31,950
That's not enough
for a conviction.

00:38:32,017 --> 00:38:34,152
Has to be.

00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:36,188
It's all we've got.

00:38:38,023 --> 00:38:41,460
The killer's left front
incisor is misaligned.

00:38:41,526 --> 00:38:44,362
Dr. Dave's smile is perfect.

00:38:44,429 --> 00:38:48,567
Would you go to a dentist
with bad teeth?

00:38:53,038 --> 00:38:55,474
BRASS:
<i>So we're all on</i>
<i>the same page, right?</i>

00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,008
About giving the
names of these girls?

00:38:57,075 --> 00:38:58,310
WILLOWS:
Yes.

00:38:58,376 --> 00:39:01,113
So, Mike, the Viewing Room
is down the end of the hall.

00:39:01,179 --> 00:39:03,081
Wait, why don't you
go in and I'll watch.

00:39:03,148 --> 00:39:05,383
What makes you think
he's gonna talk to me?

00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,818
Because I have
a pretty good feeling

00:39:06,885 --> 00:39:08,920
he's not gonna talk to me.

00:39:08,987 --> 00:39:10,989
All right.

00:39:16,928 --> 00:39:20,866
KEPPLER:
Dr. Lowry, I'd like to show you
a bite impression

00:39:20,932 --> 00:39:24,202
that we're using as evidence
in the Sorensen case.

00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:26,338
There are similarities.

00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,340
But I don't think
it's conclusive.

00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,474
Yes.

00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:32,144
The left front incisor
doesn't match,

00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:34,546
and there's a sizable gap

00:39:34,613 --> 00:39:38,283
between the two
front teeth.

00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:40,252
But then we found these.

00:39:40,318 --> 00:39:41,987
We subpoenaed your
personal records.

00:39:42,053 --> 00:39:43,288
You go to a
good dentist.

00:39:43,355 --> 00:39:45,190
KEPPLER:
In late 1989,

00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:48,360
you had a cosmetic surgery
to repair

00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:51,963
a sizable gap between
your two front teeth.

00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,800
Diastema. It's called diastema.

00:39:54,866 --> 00:39:58,103
We used the X-rays
taken before the procedure

00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:01,273
to modify your dental model
so that it matched

00:40:01,339 --> 00:40:03,942
the configuration
of your teeth in 1989.

00:40:04,009 --> 00:40:05,143
This is the new overlay.

00:40:10,215 --> 00:40:12,217
Very impressive.

00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,289
You make a good case.

00:40:17,355 --> 00:40:19,124
Wasn't easy, Dr. Lowry.

00:40:19,191 --> 00:40:21,059
You cover your tracks well.

00:40:21,126 --> 00:40:24,496
Dr. Dave, please,
call me Dr. Dave.

00:40:27,132 --> 00:40:29,034
KEPPLER:
Jane Doe in 1975,

00:40:29,101 --> 00:40:32,404
Jane Doe in 1989,
and Jane Doe, 1999.

00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,438
Three girls

00:40:33,505 --> 00:40:36,007
without identities.

00:40:36,074 --> 00:40:37,776
You were the last person
to see them alive.

00:40:37,843 --> 00:40:38,777
You know their names.

00:40:38,844 --> 00:40:41,780
Tell us.

00:40:41,847 --> 00:40:45,050
You have two daughters,
don't you, Dr. Lowry?

00:40:47,085 --> 00:40:49,588
This is the most
cryptic conversation

00:40:49,654 --> 00:40:51,523
I've had since dental school.

00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,658
All right, let me
clear it up for you.

00:40:53,725 --> 00:40:55,527
The last time you moved
as a free man

00:40:55,594 --> 00:40:57,395
was when you walked
into this room.

00:40:57,462 --> 00:40:59,731
When you leave here, you're
gonna be charged with murder.

00:40:59,798 --> 00:41:01,099
So do yourself a favor,

00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:03,435
give us the identity
of these three girls,

00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,737
and you might spare
yourself the death penalty.

00:41:05,804 --> 00:41:08,473
At my age, I'll die
before that happens.

00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:11,042
So what do you have to lose?

00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:13,445
I don't want to degrade

00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:16,248
the sweetness of my memories.

00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:20,986
My memories are all I have left.

00:41:21,052 --> 00:41:23,155
I can't imagine that
you didn't feel something

00:41:23,221 --> 00:41:25,223
for these girls at some point.

00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,358
We're just asking you

00:41:26,425 --> 00:41:28,493
to help us return them
to their families.

00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,329
What benefit would I get
from doing this?

00:41:31,396 --> 00:41:33,298
You might sleep better at night.

00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:37,269
I sleep fine,
thank you very much.

00:41:37,335 --> 00:41:41,073
I've always considered that
a key to my good health.

00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:43,542
So none of this bothers you?

00:41:45,577 --> 00:41:48,447
My life has been blessed.

00:41:48,513 --> 00:41:50,816
I was married to a kind woman.

00:41:50,882 --> 00:41:52,818
Just lost her a few years ago.

00:41:52,884 --> 00:41:54,219
We raised two children.

00:41:54,286 --> 00:41:57,889
One of them is an oral surgeon,
the other one is a homemaker.

00:41:57,956 --> 00:42:00,325
And you don't care
how this might affect them?

00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,394
They'll be horrified, of course.

00:42:02,461 --> 00:42:05,097
They're not monsters.

00:42:05,163 --> 00:42:08,500
BRASS:
Well, I'm sure the judge will
take that into consideration.

00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,902
You're not listening.

00:42:10,969 --> 00:42:13,271
I don't feel bad
about what I've done.

00:42:13,338 --> 00:42:16,908
I feel disappointed
that I've been caught,

00:42:16,975 --> 00:42:20,746
but I tend to take
the long view of things.

00:42:20,812 --> 00:42:23,415
I've had
a wonderful life,

00:42:23,482 --> 00:42:27,519
and I know that all things human

00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,288
eventually must end.
