00:00:06,534 --> 00:00:09,937
WOMAN: (laughs): Oh,
you were so on tonight, Cammie.

00:00:10,004 --> 00:00:12,373
I was channeling my nerves
in a positive way.

00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,308
Somebody's got
to hold it together.

00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:16,544
(women laughing)

00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,447
I swear, Janice can't
dance a straight line.

00:00:19,513 --> 00:00:20,714
Pigeon-toed.

00:00:20,781 --> 00:00:22,316
Should have stayed on
the bluebell line. B.G.

00:00:22,383 --> 00:00:24,685
Well, you know
how she scored

00:00:24,752 --> 00:00:25,753
that principal
role, right?

00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,723
Bad on her feet,
good on her back.

00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,492
Oh, Libby, can
you believe this?

00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:32,993
I am so sick
of this pigsty.

00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,797
Been like this ever since Lauren
got her creepy new boyfriend.

00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,500
He's a musician.
My mom dated a musician--

00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:40,901
total freeloaders.

00:00:40,968 --> 00:00:42,369
If I get bumped to
principal this week,

00:00:42,436 --> 00:00:43,604
I am so out of here.

00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:46,340
Take me with you.

00:00:46,407 --> 00:00:47,741
Becca fell off
the wagon again.

00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:49,944
The nicotine
dancer diet.

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,781
(hip-hop music blasting)

00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,882
(phone rings)

00:01:27,948 --> 00:01:29,750
WOMEN (on machine):
Hey! You've reached
Showgirl Heaven.

00:01:29,817 --> 00:01:31,752
Please leave a message
at the tone. Thanks. Bye.

00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:34,355
WOMAN:
Cammie, great audition today.

00:01:34,421 --> 00:01:36,123
You made it, girl.

00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,592
You're principal.
Call me for the details.

00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:40,361
Congrats!
(machine beeps, disconnects)

00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:00,881
Everyone's in my room.
Follow the music.

00:02:00,948 --> 00:02:02,183
Be right there.

00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:04,652
Hey, guys.

00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:07,021
(muffled scream)

00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:08,622
Libby?

00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:12,726
Libby!

00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:17,898
(camera shutter clicking)

00:02:21,602 --> 00:02:23,704
Hell of a way to spend
your night off.

00:02:23,771 --> 00:02:25,039
How many bodies
do you have in there?

00:02:25,106 --> 00:02:27,441
Three.

00:02:27,508 --> 00:02:29,110
Grissom's
down the hall,

00:02:29,176 --> 00:02:31,312
first door on your right.
Just follow the blood.

00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:49,730
(gasps)

00:02:51,499 --> 00:02:53,834
My date got canceled.

00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:55,770
I'm sure he had a good excuse.

00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:04,078
Looks like sexual assault.

00:03:04,145 --> 00:03:06,013
Bound, pants pulled down.

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,381
Yeah.

00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:08,482
Where do you want me?

00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:11,919
Next bedroom.
There's another body in there.

00:03:11,986 --> 00:03:13,554
Well, that makes five.

00:03:13,621 --> 00:03:15,923
The dispatch said
there were six.

00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,491
According to Brass,

00:03:17,558 --> 00:03:19,894
the boyfriend of one of
the victims found the bodies.

00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,363
Said there were six roommates,
all showgirls.

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,799
Evidently, one
didn't come home.

00:03:24,865 --> 00:03:26,534
She picked the right night.

00:04:01,335 --> 00:04:03,537
Hot scene!
Suspect under the bed!

00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:05,573
Sara!

00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:08,576
(sputters):
Please... please help me.

00:04:08,642 --> 00:04:09,577
Please.

00:04:09,643 --> 00:04:10,644
Hold on.

00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:13,214
Victim down!
Call an ambulance!

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,450
Dispatch, this is CSI Grissom...
You're safe now, okay?

00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:18,319
You're safe now.
It's going to be okay.

00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:21,122
Help me. Help me.

00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:05,237
Up until a few hours ago,
this was considered

00:05:05,303 --> 00:05:07,706
one of the safest
neighborhoods in Las Vegas.

00:05:07,772 --> 00:05:10,108
But with the discovery
of six young women

00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:11,810
brutally slain
in their beds...

00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:13,145
I got here at 3:45.

00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:15,113
I've been dating Becca
about a month.

00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,182
When I saw all that blood
on the stairs,

00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:20,018
I just... I just knew.

00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:22,053
Jonathan, do you have
a key to the house?

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,188
Becca gave it to me.

00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:27,058
I usually try to come over
and say good night,

00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:30,529
but I was... I was late.
Had a couple

00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:32,464
clients in town.

00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:34,399
But I didn't need the key.

00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:36,001
Front door was open.

00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:38,069
If we brought you some photos,

00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:39,905
would you be able
to ID the girls

00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:41,973
for us?

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,512
(helicopter flies overhead)

00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:55,053
Look, I know
this is tough,

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,155
but did she give you anything?

00:05:57,222 --> 00:06:00,725
She told me her name.

00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:04,763
When I went into the room,
she thought that I was him.

00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,932
Anything else?

00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:10,101
It didn't make any sense.

00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:12,604
Can you tell
me your name?

00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:15,907
Ca... Cam... Cammie.

00:06:15,974 --> 00:06:18,510
Cammie, I'm Sara.

00:06:18,577 --> 00:06:20,445
Who did this to you, Cammie?

00:06:20,512 --> 00:06:23,081
Mm-an.... mm-an.

00:06:23,148 --> 00:06:25,116
The man, what did he look like?

00:06:25,183 --> 00:06:26,551
Poor w...

00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:28,086
Poor wine...

00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:31,122
Breast...

00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:33,558
Breast... knife...

00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,627
He-he stabbed you in the chest?
(grunts)

00:06:35,694 --> 00:06:37,195
No.

00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:38,597
I need some help here!

00:06:38,663 --> 00:06:42,400
Bye... Fin...
(gasps)

00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:43,768
No, no. No.

00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:54,312
STOKES: Looks like
he was about a size 11.

00:06:55,347 --> 00:06:58,450
You been up there yet?

00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:09,928
PHILLIPS:
<i>I've been through all</i>
<i>the bedrooms. She's the last.</i>

00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:13,331
Rebecca Mayford.
Boyfriend ID'd her.

00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:15,100
Neck's clean.

00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:17,903
The other five victims'
throats were transected.

00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:20,672
There are at least
a dozen stab wounds

00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:23,341
to the chest
and abdomen.

00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:26,278
Yeah. He took his time with her.

00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:29,047
The others were
killed efficiently.

00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:31,716
Liver temp is 95.6.

00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:34,686
Been dead
at least two hours, which

00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:36,955
is consistent with four
of the five other victims.

00:07:37,022 --> 00:07:40,492
David, don't move any
of the bodies just yet, okay?

00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:42,327
You got it.

00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:46,698
Hey.

00:07:47,732 --> 00:07:49,034
What did
you find?

00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,368
Partial footprint.

00:07:50,435 --> 00:07:54,172
Whoever kicked in this window

00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:56,775
was barefoot.

00:07:58,243 --> 00:08:00,245
She's wearing socks.

00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:02,013
Yeah, but some
of the others weren't.

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,716
Means one of them must have
been in here at some point.

00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:08,887
I don't think this was her room.

00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:12,991
GRISSOM:
What else?

00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:16,061
Looks like the bindings
were cut from the sheets.

00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:21,566
It takes at least a few minutes
to cut up a sheet.

00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:24,736
I think when he came to this
house, he was unprepared.

00:08:24,803 --> 00:08:27,939
He had to use things
that were already here.

00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:31,042
They say a disorganized killer

00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:34,913
is apt to obtain
his victims by chance.

00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,782
<i>Luck of the draw.</i>

00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:50,428
Busy night.

00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:02,207
She looks so familiar.

00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:04,476
When I first
started doing this,

00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:07,345
everybody I worked on
reminded me of someone.

00:09:10,715 --> 00:09:12,617
Somehow,
we all get past it.

00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:15,086
I'm not so sure
that's a good thing.

00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:19,257
I'll start
with the bathroom.

00:10:12,444 --> 00:10:16,848
The girl in this picture
is the victim from my room.

00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:20,652
MAN'S RECORDED VOICE FROM BEAR:
Becca, I'm so crazy about you.

00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:23,989
I just wanted to tell you
happy three-week anniversary!

00:10:24,055 --> 00:10:26,958
You're awesome!
And I love you bear-y much.

00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:30,562
Sounds like Becca
was still a kid.

00:10:32,664 --> 00:10:34,866
Yeah. Well,

00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:37,803
not when she was onstage.

00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:41,573
So, Grissom, I found
beige carpet fibers

00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,074
on all three victims.

00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:44,943
It's consistent with
the hallway carpet.

00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,846
I've also found rug
burns on their knees.

00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,996
Killer herded them all
into here,

00:11:05,063 --> 00:11:07,499
he used the sheets from that bed
to tie them up,

00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,067
then dragged them all
down the hallway

00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:10,936
to the other two bedrooms
to kill them.

00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:14,406
(muffled screams)

00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,110
What about Becca?

00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:22,013
Why wasn't she dragged
somewhere else?

00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,548
Maybe he wanted
to get her alone.

00:11:23,615 --> 00:11:24,716
Maybe she excited him...

00:11:24,783 --> 00:11:26,451
or pissed him off.

00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:27,986
Either way,
he was brutal with her.

00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:29,187
She was the messiest kill.

00:11:29,254 --> 00:11:31,323
He had a gun.

00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:32,791
I found grip and
slide impressions

00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,459
in some powder on
the bathroom counter.

00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:36,828
Well, a gun is one good
way for crowd control.

00:11:36,895 --> 00:11:38,230
Why didn't he
just shoot them?

00:11:38,296 --> 00:11:40,465
Noise factor?

00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:42,701
You can't scream once
your throat's been slit.

00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:44,236
Yeah.

00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:46,304
He had all the time he needed

00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:48,406
'cause the neighbors
couldn't hear a thing.

00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:52,677
(garbled radio transmission)

00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:42,828
(camera shutter clicking)

00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:48,934
(garbled radio transmission)

00:12:57,342 --> 00:12:59,845
(door opening)

00:13:07,185 --> 00:13:10,055
He used a chair to jam
this door.

00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:11,456
I heard about what happened.

00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:12,824
You okay?

00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:14,960
I'm fine.

00:13:15,026 --> 00:13:17,729
There's a custom-made label

00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,197
on a wine bottle over there.

00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:30,075
"Love, Lewis."

00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,210
SIDLE:
<i>Who did this to you, Cammie?</i>

00:13:32,277 --> 00:13:35,280
Mm-an.... mm-an.

00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,414
The man,

00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:37,883
what did he look like?

00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:40,852
Poor w...

00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:42,154
Poor wine.

00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,357
Cammie said something.

00:13:45,423 --> 00:13:48,326
"Poor wine."

00:13:48,393 --> 00:13:50,929
Maybe it had something to do
with this bottle.

00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:54,933
"Poor wine."

00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,334
Maybe he forced wine
down her throat.

00:13:56,401 --> 00:13:57,602
Tox will tell us.

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,208
It was good

00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,044
that you were there
for her, Sara.

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,347
She didn't have
to die alone.

00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:12,918
We usually show up too late
to meet the victim.

00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,459
RADIO REPORTER:
Police have confirmed
there are a total of six victims

00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:23,228
in the Green Valley
showgirl murders.

00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,163
The names have not yet
been released

00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,731
pending individual
identification

00:14:26,798 --> 00:14:29,134
and notification
of their families.

00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,669
According to police sources,

00:14:30,735 --> 00:14:32,737
there are no suspects
at this time.

00:14:32,804 --> 00:14:35,941
LVPD has asked anyone
with any information

00:14:36,007 --> 00:14:37,876
to call the following
hotline number:

00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:42,581
702-555-0132.

00:14:42,647 --> 00:14:44,382
Again, that number...

00:14:48,593 --> 00:14:50,729

ROBBINS:
All six victims
had ligature marks

00:16:19,784 --> 00:16:21,386
on their ankles and wrists.

00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:24,022
Jenn Smith was the only one
with rib fractures.

00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:25,790
She took some abuse.

00:16:25,857 --> 00:16:27,325
Except for Becca Mayford,

00:16:27,392 --> 00:16:30,428
COD was exsanguination through
incised wounds to the neck

00:16:30,495 --> 00:16:32,363
with a sharp-edged
instrument.

00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,799
How did Cammie Brookston
survive until we got there?

00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:36,101
Well, in her case,

00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:38,903
there was only a partial
transection of the jugular.

00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,806
Shallower cut, slower bleed.

00:16:41,873 --> 00:16:45,910
I found her at least two hours
after the attacks.

00:16:45,977 --> 00:16:47,445
She must've applied
pressure to her wound.

00:16:47,512 --> 00:16:49,013
That would've bought her
some time.

00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,882
So if we'd have
found her sooner,

00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:52,784
she would still be alive.

00:16:52,851 --> 00:16:56,254
Sara, there's nothing
you could've done.

00:16:56,321 --> 00:16:59,257
Well, she has a C-section
uterine scar.

00:16:59,324 --> 00:17:00,859
Hairline, almost invisible.

00:17:00,925 --> 00:17:03,361
She has a child.

00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:05,430
Well, she gave birth
some time ago.

00:17:05,497 --> 00:17:07,799
Any signs of sexual assault?

00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:09,200
Not with Cammie.

00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:11,703
I found semen in the vaginas
of Emily Wilson

00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,139
and Lauren Walderson.

00:17:14,205 --> 00:17:16,608
Both had mild reddening
and some superficial abrasion

00:17:16,674 --> 00:17:17,842
at the vaginal introitus.

00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:20,712
They could have had
consensual sex

00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:22,914
in the hours prior
to the attack.

00:17:22,981 --> 00:17:24,816
This young lady was raped.

00:17:24,883 --> 00:17:29,187
Rebecca Mayford had lacerations
at 3:00.

00:17:29,254 --> 00:17:33,158
Contusions extended from 4:00
to 8:00 and 10:00 to 12:00.

00:17:33,224 --> 00:17:35,193
Any semen?
No.

00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,529
But, uh, look at
these puncture wounds.

00:17:37,595 --> 00:17:40,565
Stab wounds have
a large cutting component

00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:41,900
to the margins.

00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:44,369
Several of these stabs
have additional tracks

00:17:44,436 --> 00:17:46,838
through the organ suggesting
a partial withdrawal

00:17:46,905 --> 00:17:48,840
and re-thrust of the blade.

00:17:48,907 --> 00:17:51,476
Is that everything then?

00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:53,645
Not quite.
He left something

00:17:53,712 --> 00:17:55,380
behind.

00:17:55,447 --> 00:17:57,582
SIDLE:
The tip of the knife.

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,922
GRISSOM:
<i>Yes, sir, I understand that,</i>

00:18:03,988 --> 00:18:07,325
but, uh, we're still analyzing
the evidence.

00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:11,529
As soon as we have something
to report, we'll report it.

00:18:11,596 --> 00:18:14,065
Okay.

00:18:14,132 --> 00:18:17,102
I may have something for
you to feed to the monster.

00:18:17,168 --> 00:18:20,672
An attack order based
on the blood evidence.

00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:21,706
In the bathroom trash,

00:18:21,773 --> 00:18:23,942
I found six bloody
paper towels.

00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:25,710
Wendy ran the DNA.

00:18:25,777 --> 00:18:28,446
Each towel has blood
from only one victim.

00:18:28,513 --> 00:18:30,382
Bottom of the pile--
first victim,

00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:31,483
top of the pile-- last.

00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:32,684
And the pattern
on each

00:18:32,751 --> 00:18:35,453
is consistent with
the knife being wiped off.

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,255
I think that the killer

00:18:37,322 --> 00:18:40,258
cleaned off the knife
after each kill.

00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:43,061
<i>First was Emily...</i>

00:18:43,128 --> 00:18:46,064
<i>then Lauren...</i>

00:18:46,131 --> 00:18:50,735
Both found in Warrick's bedroom.

00:18:50,802 --> 00:18:52,270
Libby was next.

00:18:52,337 --> 00:18:55,740
She was found dead
in Sara's bedroom.

00:18:55,807 --> 00:18:58,943
Then Cammie was attacked,
followed by Jennifer.

00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,846
She was found on the floor
in Warrick's bedroom.

00:19:01,913 --> 00:19:04,282
There's no logic to any of this.

00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:06,785
But you were right,
Becca was attacked last.

00:19:06,851 --> 00:19:10,255
It was all of her blood that was
tracked throughout the house.

00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:12,090
<i>He stepped in her blood,</i>

00:19:12,157 --> 00:19:14,559
<i>walks into the bathroom</i>
<i>to clean off the knife,</i>

00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:17,228
<i>back out into the hallway</i>
<i>down the stairs.</i>

00:19:17,295 --> 00:19:21,366
But why would he clean off
the knife between victims?

00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:23,101
To maintain control.

00:19:23,168 --> 00:19:24,469
I see a clean knife,

00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:26,805
I think that the others
are still alive and...

00:19:26,871 --> 00:19:29,607
I'm more compliant.

00:19:29,674 --> 00:19:31,042
This is Sara Sidle.

00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:32,811
Leave a message after the tone.
(beeps)

00:19:32,877 --> 00:19:37,015
Sara, the knife tip Doc Robbins
extracted from Becca Mayford

00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:39,284
isn't metal, it's ceramic...

00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,219
and extremely sharp.

00:19:41,286 --> 00:19:43,555
I accept your thank you
in advance and you're welcome.

00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:56,301
(buzzing)

00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:58,236
(buzzing)

00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:06,411
(buzzing)

00:20:11,883 --> 00:20:13,985
Hello?

00:20:14,052 --> 00:20:17,856
Uh, no, ma'am, Libby's not here.

00:20:17,922 --> 00:20:19,324
My name is David Hodges.

00:20:19,391 --> 00:20:24,095
I work for the Las Vegas
crime lab.

00:20:24,162 --> 00:20:25,897
Well, ma'am, uh...

00:20:25,964 --> 00:20:28,400
I can't really say...

00:20:28,466 --> 00:20:31,803
but I can give you the number
of someone who can.

00:20:35,607 --> 00:20:39,177
Did your daughter Libby
wear a heart-shaped necklace?

00:20:46,851 --> 00:20:49,220
Y-Y-Yes, yeah, I-I'm still here.

00:20:49,287 --> 00:20:51,589
Uh, ma'am...

00:20:51,656 --> 00:20:55,894
I don't know quite
how to say this, but, um...

00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,731
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:02,700
I matched Jenn Smith's
footprints with a partial

00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:04,302
Grissom lifted from
that broken window.

00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:06,337
According to Catherine's
attack order,

00:21:06,404 --> 00:21:08,139
Cammie was stabbed first
and then Jenn.

00:21:08,206 --> 00:21:09,574
He didn't get sloppy
with Cammie,

00:21:09,641 --> 00:21:10,709
he got distracted.

00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:13,011
So he was with Cammie
when Jenn tried to escape.

00:21:13,078 --> 00:21:17,082
(banging, muffled yelling)

00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:20,618
(glass cracks)

00:21:25,223 --> 00:21:27,225
Which explains
Jenn's fractures.

00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:29,260
He kicked the crap
out of her.

00:21:29,327 --> 00:21:30,829
He must have gone
to the bathroom,

00:21:30,895 --> 00:21:31,896
cleaned off the knife,

00:21:31,963 --> 00:21:33,998
then dragged Jenn down
the hallway to kill her.

00:21:34,065 --> 00:21:35,867
He never went back
to check on Cammie.

00:21:35,934 --> 00:21:38,837
BROWN:
Six girls, one lock.

00:21:38,903 --> 00:21:40,939
JOHNSON:
I ran the names
of all the victims.

00:21:41,005 --> 00:21:42,774
This article's
the only common link.

00:21:42,841 --> 00:21:46,177
"They pooled their money
and lived the dream in style."

00:21:46,244 --> 00:21:48,380
JOHNSON:
This could definitely
bait a killer.

00:21:48,446 --> 00:21:50,081
The only thing missing
from this is their address.

00:21:50,148 --> 00:21:52,917
It says "Green Valley,"
it's got a photo of the house.

00:21:52,984 --> 00:21:54,619
If you looked hard enough,
you could find it.

00:21:54,686 --> 00:21:57,522
Lewis Greyburg
wrote the article.

00:21:57,589 --> 00:21:59,891
"Lewis" is the name
on a custom wine label

00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,260
that we found
at the crime scene.

00:22:02,327 --> 00:22:03,762
Do me a favor.

00:22:03,828 --> 00:22:05,163
Could you zoom in
on that photo?

00:22:08,633 --> 00:22:11,136
Oh, my God.

00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,639
I knew I recognized her.

00:22:14,706 --> 00:22:16,808
Emily Wilson.

00:22:18,476 --> 00:22:20,545
Figures you'd know
a showgirl.

00:22:20,612 --> 00:22:22,714
Take it you've
seen her dance, then, huh?

00:22:22,781 --> 00:22:26,451
No, last time I saw her,
she was still wearing braces.

00:22:35,794 --> 00:22:37,495
(dog barking in distance)

00:22:50,075 --> 00:22:52,310
Warrick Brown.

00:22:52,377 --> 00:22:54,412
I remember you standing
on my steps

00:22:54,479 --> 00:22:57,749
with those guilty green eyes,
afraid to come in

00:22:57,816 --> 00:23:00,485
because you knew your
grandma would size you up

00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:02,253
no matter what kind of trouble
you got into.

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,589
I don't remember any trouble.

00:23:04,656 --> 00:23:06,691
Like when you were
13 years old

00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:09,094
and you took her new Buick
out for a spin.

00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,396
Oh, and I banged the bumper
trying to parallel park.

00:23:11,463 --> 00:23:12,464
I forgot about that one.

00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,465
Mm-hmm.

00:23:13,531 --> 00:23:17,001
I haven't seen you
since your grandma passed.

00:23:17,068 --> 00:23:18,770
Yeah, the old neighborhood
reminds me

00:23:18,837 --> 00:23:20,271
how much
I miss her.

00:23:20,338 --> 00:23:21,806
So why you here?

00:23:21,873 --> 00:23:22,907
I came to see you.

00:23:22,974 --> 00:23:24,342
Oh.

00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:27,345
Let me take that
for you.

00:23:27,412 --> 00:23:29,514
New family painted
right over my history.

00:23:29,581 --> 00:23:31,916
That's 'cause they're
making their own history.

00:23:35,987 --> 00:23:40,658
You know, my daughter
Chelsea died last August.

00:23:40,725 --> 00:23:41,693
Oh, God.

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,061
Mm-hmm. Lung cancer.

00:23:43,128 --> 00:23:45,930
She never smoked
a day in her life,

00:23:45,997 --> 00:23:47,899
but her sorry husband did.

00:23:47,966 --> 00:23:50,235
He's healthy
as an ox.

00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:51,569
Mrs. Wilson...

00:23:51,636 --> 00:23:53,805
You were always
interrupting your grandma.

00:23:53,872 --> 00:23:55,807
but-but she liked that.

00:23:55,874 --> 00:23:58,276
That's because you were
thinking, she said.

00:23:58,343 --> 00:23:59,644
Oh, she was proud of you.

00:23:59,711 --> 00:24:02,347
You remember my little
granddaughter, Emily.

00:24:02,414 --> 00:24:05,383
The next time you
drive up the Strip,

00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,318
you, you going to see
her little buns in lights

00:24:07,385 --> 00:24:08,753
'cause she's a dancer now.

00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,089
Uh-huh.

00:24:11,156 --> 00:24:12,557
Um...

00:24:12,624 --> 00:24:14,893
What, what, what, what?

00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:16,961
I'm working this case.

00:24:18,897 --> 00:24:20,765
Those six showgirls...

00:24:20,832 --> 00:24:22,667
The ones in the news?

00:24:22,734 --> 00:24:26,204
Emily listed you
as the next of kin.

00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:29,708
No.

00:24:29,774 --> 00:24:32,110
No.

00:24:32,177 --> 00:24:35,914
Oh, oh, please, God...

00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,716
No!

00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,886
I'm so sorry.

00:24:41,953 --> 00:24:43,621
I'm sorry.

00:24:43,688 --> 00:24:45,290
Oh...

00:24:45,356 --> 00:24:46,858
We're pursuing a number of leads

00:24:46,925 --> 00:24:50,261
based on evidence
gathered at the scene.

00:24:50,328 --> 00:24:51,496
Now, we believe

00:24:51,563 --> 00:24:53,832
that our suspect targeted
one individual in particular

00:24:53,898 --> 00:24:56,134
and that's where the
investigation is focused.

00:24:56,201 --> 00:24:59,537
Look, look, we have every
available police officer

00:24:59,604 --> 00:25:00,538
out looking for him.

00:25:00,605 --> 00:25:02,741
He can run, but he can't hide.

00:25:05,831 --> 00:25:08,601
So, Mr. Greyburg, you
don't want a lawyer?

00:25:08,668 --> 00:25:10,102
Why would I need a lawyer?

00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:13,906
I sent the wine over
to express my gratitude

00:25:13,973 --> 00:25:16,142
for their cooperation
on the article.

00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:18,377
How did you get to know them?

00:25:18,444 --> 00:25:22,515
I followed them around for
a week as part of my research.

00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:24,884
They were nice kids.

00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:27,753
Uh, with big hearts.

00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,221
It's an airhead piece.

00:25:29,288 --> 00:25:30,556
My editor gave me
an angle,

00:25:30,623 --> 00:25:31,691
I ran with it.

00:25:31,757 --> 00:25:35,194
But those girls
raised $12,000

00:25:35,261 --> 00:25:38,097
for a fellow showgirl
with breast cancer.

00:25:38,164 --> 00:25:39,732
They organized their
own walk-a-thon.

00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:42,001
They gave out swag bags,
kitchen stuff.

00:25:42,068 --> 00:25:43,603
What kind of kitchen stuff?

00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:44,904
Uh...

00:25:44,971 --> 00:25:48,441
cutting board, juicer,
kitchen knife.

00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:50,042
<i>Breast...</i>

00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:51,911
breast...

00:25:52,979 --> 00:25:54,680
He stabbed you in the chest?

00:25:54,747 --> 00:25:56,215
No!

00:25:58,851 --> 00:25:59,785
Sara.

00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:01,887
What did the knife look like?

00:26:01,954 --> 00:26:07,226
It had a purple handle embossed
with the name of their friend

00:26:07,293 --> 00:26:08,261
and the date.

00:26:08,327 --> 00:26:10,696
It was ceramic.

00:26:10,763 --> 00:26:13,099
Killer shoes.

00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:18,371
There were multiple shoe
impressions in blood

00:26:18,437 --> 00:26:22,141
at the house,
looked just like those.

00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:24,443
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:27,313
Look, I didn't kill
those girls.

00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,082
Where were you last night,
Mr. Greyburg?

00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:34,120
I was at home alone
working on my novel.

00:26:34,186 --> 00:26:35,888
STOKES:
Prove it.

00:26:35,955 --> 00:26:37,924
We'll take your little ceramic
knife, give us your shoes,

00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,558
and we'll take a sample
of your DNA.

00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:41,794
You can have whatever you want.

00:26:41,861 --> 00:26:44,363
Just stop looking
at me that way.

00:27:26,205 --> 00:27:28,140
Wendy swabbed the ligatures
cut from the sheet

00:27:28,207 --> 00:27:29,775
for epithelials.

00:27:29,842 --> 00:27:32,111
Each knot had one DNA source
on it; female,

00:27:32,178 --> 00:27:34,213
but not from the victim
who was tied up.

00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,749
So he forced them
to tie each other up.

00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,485
Tighter!

00:27:39,552 --> 00:27:43,055
Please don't make me do this.

00:27:43,122 --> 00:27:44,724
Thanks.

00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,859
It was all Wendy.

00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:47,893
Hey, Greg.

00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,896
The, uh, civil suit

00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:54,700
that was filed
by the Demitrius James family,

00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:56,569
DA decided
not to go to trial.

00:27:56,636 --> 00:27:57,603
So the city's agreed

00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,239
to a payout; $2.5 million.

00:28:00,306 --> 00:28:01,974
$2.5 million?

00:28:03,676 --> 00:28:05,778
That's like saying
I'm the guilty one.

00:28:05,845 --> 00:28:06,912
It's just

00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:08,447
political pragmatism.

00:28:08,514 --> 00:28:10,283
City wants to cut their losses.

00:28:10,349 --> 00:28:12,952
So they did throw me
under the bus.

00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:15,288
Comes with the job.

00:28:21,127 --> 00:28:24,697
Ran a laser ablation on the
knife tip from Becca's spine.

00:28:24,764 --> 00:28:28,434
Zirconium oxide,
otherwise known as ceramic.

00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:30,870
Basically,
ceramic is glass.

00:28:30,937 --> 00:28:33,306
Both the exemplar that
you got from the reporter

00:28:33,372 --> 00:28:34,674
and the murder weapon

00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,909
have the same composition,
color, texture and thickness.

00:28:36,976 --> 00:28:38,411
The killer could have
gotten the knife

00:28:38,477 --> 00:28:39,912
from a swag bag
at the walk-a-thon.

00:28:39,979 --> 00:28:43,549
Either that or he could
have gotten it from the house.

00:28:43,616 --> 00:28:48,321
You find me the broken knife,
and I'll match the tip.

00:28:49,355 --> 00:28:52,124
What's wrong with you?

00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:54,860
Nothing.

00:28:58,631 --> 00:28:59,599
You ever

00:28:59,665 --> 00:29:01,334
do the right thing
and still feel

00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,135
guilty about it?

00:29:03,202 --> 00:29:05,504
Yeah.

00:29:05,571 --> 00:29:07,406
Sucks, doesn't it?

00:29:07,473 --> 00:29:09,241
Yeah.

00:29:17,149 --> 00:29:19,251
So I lifted two sets of prints
from the wine bottle,

00:29:19,318 --> 00:29:20,820
but there's no match
to any of the victims.

00:29:20,886 --> 00:29:22,421
Any hits?

00:29:22,488 --> 00:29:24,257
One set was smudges.

00:29:24,323 --> 00:29:26,325
I'm guessing whoever
they belonged to works
with their hands.

00:29:26,392 --> 00:29:27,960
You know,
calloused, cut.

00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:30,830
The other set came back
to a Chris Mullins.

00:29:32,531 --> 00:29:34,033
His work card's
in the system.

00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,635
He's a musician
at the Legs show

00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:38,037
where all the
girls danced.

00:29:38,104 --> 00:29:39,572
Well, there's a cold brewski
on the table.

00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:40,806
We must have just missed him.

00:29:40,873 --> 00:29:41,807
Captain?
Yeah, what?

00:29:41,874 --> 00:29:43,009
Neighbor gave
this guy up.

00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:44,343
Mullins hangs out
at a bar right
down the street.

00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,678
All right, we'll check it out.

00:29:45,745 --> 00:29:47,179
But first we're going
to lose the radio cars.

00:29:47,246 --> 00:29:48,180
Post an unmarked.

00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:49,982
I'm going to put a broadcast out
on his vehicle.

00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:51,617
He's gotta come home
sometime.

00:29:51,684 --> 00:29:54,186
Control, this is 2-0-3 Charlie,
Captain Brass.

00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:57,156
(over radio): Go ahead, Captain.
(sirens wailing)

00:29:57,223 --> 00:29:59,091
Whoo!

00:29:59,158 --> 00:30:00,660
Did you call for backup?

00:30:00,726 --> 00:30:04,664
Look, uh, two squad cars
just passed rolling Code Three.

00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,799
I'm at 562
Herrick Drive.

00:30:06,866 --> 00:30:08,167
Where are they en route to?

00:30:08,234 --> 00:30:11,170
Units are responding
to a 415 Baker in progress

00:30:11,237 --> 00:30:12,438
outside the Trip Wire Bar.

00:30:12,505 --> 00:30:14,507
Person down, suspect possibly
still in location.

00:30:14,573 --> 00:30:15,541
All right, copy that.

00:30:15,608 --> 00:30:17,410
I'm headed to the 415B location.

00:30:17,476 --> 00:30:18,644
Assault with
a deadly weapon?

00:30:18,711 --> 00:30:20,179
Feeling lucky?

00:30:23,649 --> 00:30:25,651
Sir, could you move
your hand, please?

00:30:25,718 --> 00:30:26,686
Please?

00:30:26,752 --> 00:30:28,521
Thank you.

00:30:28,587 --> 00:30:31,257
BRASS:
Hey, what do you got?

00:30:31,324 --> 00:30:32,725
Marlon Frost, out of state.

00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:33,926
Bar patron found him.

00:30:33,993 --> 00:30:35,328
Anyone see the suspect?

00:30:35,394 --> 00:30:36,996
Mm-mm, no witnesses.

00:30:37,063 --> 00:30:38,664
Okay, I'm going inside.
Chris Mullins hangs out here.

00:30:38,731 --> 00:30:40,700
Somebody's got
to know something.

00:30:40,766 --> 00:30:43,002
Incise wound
to the neck?
Yeah.

00:30:43,069 --> 00:30:44,737
Seems to be flavor
of the week.

00:30:44,804 --> 00:30:46,439
Did he say anything?

00:30:46,505 --> 00:30:48,407
I don't think he can.

00:30:54,246 --> 00:30:55,881
STOKES:
Hey, Sara?

00:30:55,948 --> 00:30:59,185
Got a knife over here.

00:30:59,251 --> 00:31:00,720
Tip's broken off.

00:31:00,786 --> 00:31:02,455
That's probably going to be
the murder weapon right there.

00:31:02,521 --> 00:31:07,226
(woman whimpering, man grunting)

00:31:07,293 --> 00:31:12,231
And it matches the one
from the swag bag.

00:31:12,298 --> 00:31:15,334
Crime scene's only
a couple blocks from here.

00:31:15,401 --> 00:31:16,802
I'm going to go
with the vic.

00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:18,738
I'm going to collect
his clothes.

00:31:18,804 --> 00:31:22,241
You sure that's really
such a good idea?

00:31:22,308 --> 00:31:24,910
Hold up!
I'm coming with you.

00:31:32,618 --> 00:31:34,053
My name is Sara.

00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,690
Just hold on.
You're going to be fine.

00:31:43,362 --> 00:31:44,931
(grunting)

00:31:44,997 --> 00:31:47,767
Do you know who did this to you?

00:31:53,376 --> 00:31:55,411
BRASS:
<i>Seen this guy?</i>

00:31:55,478 --> 00:31:56,412
Marlon Frost?

00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:57,914
He was just stabbed
in the parking lot.

00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,982
Yeah, I seen him around
last couple of days.

00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:01,551
Friendly enough.

00:32:01,617 --> 00:32:03,653
What, did he get into an
argument or something here?

00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:04,654
It's not that
type of place.

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,655
Yeah, right.

00:32:05,721 --> 00:32:07,490
Uh, how about this guy?

00:32:07,557 --> 00:32:08,624
You see him? Chris Mullins?

00:32:08,691 --> 00:32:10,460
Yeah, he's a regular of mine.

00:32:10,526 --> 00:32:11,994
A-lister with the ladies,
you know.

00:32:12,061 --> 00:32:13,496
Has he been in lately?

00:32:13,563 --> 00:32:15,965
Why don't you check in the back?

00:32:16,032 --> 00:32:17,333
Great.

00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,168
(toilet flushes)

00:32:19,235 --> 00:32:22,371
Chris Mullins?

00:32:22,438 --> 00:32:23,406
Yeah?

00:32:23,473 --> 00:32:25,741
I hope you washed your hands.

00:32:25,808 --> 00:32:29,245
I didn't stab that guy,
I didn't kill those girls.

00:32:29,312 --> 00:32:31,581
I will cop to drinking
their wine.

00:32:31,647 --> 00:32:33,583
So you're in the house
the night of the murders.

00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:36,686
I'd been messing around
with Lauren since last weekend.

00:32:36,752 --> 00:32:38,821
You know, you don't seem
too upset that she's dead.

00:32:40,723 --> 00:32:43,226
How come your fingerprints
are in every single room

00:32:43,292 --> 00:32:44,327
of the house?

00:32:44,393 --> 00:32:45,795
It's kind of an inside joke.

00:32:45,862 --> 00:32:48,197
We did it
in all her roommates' beds

00:32:48,264 --> 00:32:49,599
just to see if they noticed.

00:32:49,665 --> 00:32:51,667
But you're only having
sex with Lauren, right?

00:32:51,734 --> 00:32:53,836
She was a good place to put it

00:32:53,903 --> 00:32:55,104
till something better
came along.

00:32:55,171 --> 00:32:56,506
I guess that's funny

00:32:56,572 --> 00:32:58,040
to somebody.

00:32:58,107 --> 00:33:00,143
But when we get
a warrant

00:33:00,209 --> 00:33:02,245
for your DNA and match it
to the semen we found in

00:33:02,311 --> 00:33:04,881
Lauren and Emily, the joke
is going to be on you, pal.

00:33:06,716 --> 00:33:09,986
I was supposed to meet Lauren
after her last show.

00:33:10,052 --> 00:33:12,021
She was late.

00:33:12,088 --> 00:33:13,422
Emily was home.

00:33:13,489 --> 00:33:15,858
And you couldn't help yourself,
right, stud?

00:33:15,925 --> 00:33:17,360
Girl politics.

00:33:17,426 --> 00:33:19,462
One wants what the other has.

00:33:19,529 --> 00:33:20,630
Why <i>not</i> give it?

00:33:20,696 --> 00:33:22,431
So I guess when
Lauren came home,

00:33:22,498 --> 00:33:23,966
you gave it to her, too.

00:33:24,033 --> 00:33:26,869
Is that right, Santa?

00:33:26,936 --> 00:33:28,471
And what about Becca?

00:33:28,538 --> 00:33:29,639
Was she blonde?

00:33:29,705 --> 00:33:31,674
I didn't meet all the roommates.

00:33:31,741 --> 00:33:34,343
Boy, you have an answer
for everything, huh?

00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:37,480
What about the
guy in the bar?

00:33:37,547 --> 00:33:39,582
What about him,
what did he do,

00:33:39,649 --> 00:33:41,651
look at you the wrong
way, bum a smoke?

00:33:41,717 --> 00:33:44,387
Or did he want you
to give it to him, too?

00:33:44,453 --> 00:33:45,888
You know what?

00:33:45,955 --> 00:33:47,690
Lawyer. Now.

00:33:47,757 --> 00:33:49,492
BROWN:
<i>Well, DNA confirmed that</i>

00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:51,861
Mullins had sex
with Emily and Lauren.

00:33:51,928 --> 00:33:55,331
Assuming he's the killer,
why didn't we find
any semen in Becca?

00:33:55,398 --> 00:33:58,868
Maybe by the time he got to her,
he was unable to ejaculate.

00:33:58,935 --> 00:34:01,471
I was able to make a physical
match between the broken tip

00:34:01,537 --> 00:34:03,606
in Becca and the knife recovered
from outside the bar.

00:34:03,673 --> 00:34:05,775
GRISSOM:
Was the same knife used
to stab Marlon Frost?

00:34:05,842 --> 00:34:07,677
STOKES:
We don't know yet.

00:34:07,743 --> 00:34:10,713
Sara's at the hospital now--
she's bringing back a DNA sample

00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,949
to compare.
Whoever...

00:34:13,015 --> 00:34:14,917
shanked Frost
killed those girls.

00:34:14,984 --> 00:34:17,453
Did you get any prints
on that knife?
Yeah. No ridge detail.

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,689
Same smudges were found
on the wine bottles

00:34:19,755 --> 00:34:20,923
and in the bedrooms.

00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,558
GRISSOM:
Smudges won't put the knife

00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:24,594
in Mullins' hands, though.
I don't get it.

00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,629
He stabs the guy
and walks back in the bar.

00:34:26,696 --> 00:34:28,564
All the evidence at the house

00:34:28,631 --> 00:34:31,734
suggests that the killer
was unfamiliar with the layout.

00:34:31,801 --> 00:34:33,636
And by his own admission,
Mullins had been

00:34:33,703 --> 00:34:35,805
in that house
at least a couple of nights.

00:34:35,872 --> 00:34:37,707
Well, that's also
how he could've made

00:34:37,773 --> 00:34:39,108
the connection to Becca.

00:34:41,277 --> 00:34:43,446
(camera shutter clicking)

00:34:43,513 --> 00:34:46,149
Mr. Frost,
I'll be out of your way soon.

00:34:48,284 --> 00:34:50,153
I'm sure you want
to get some sleep.

00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:53,356
I just need to get
your fingerprints.

00:34:53,422 --> 00:34:54,557
It's routine.

00:34:54,624 --> 00:34:56,359
I promise it won't hurt.

00:35:31,561 --> 00:35:33,729
♪ ♪

00:35:46,576 --> 00:35:49,078
SIDLE (grunting):
Get off me!

00:35:49,846 --> 00:35:51,147
Get off me!

00:35:53,449 --> 00:35:54,884
(Sidle gasps)

00:35:54,951 --> 00:35:56,986
(woman gasping, yelling)

00:35:57,053 --> 00:35:59,388
(distant clattering)
(gasps)

00:35:59,455 --> 00:36:01,324
(glass breaking)

00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:05,294
(gasping breaths):
Port... port wine... port wine.

00:36:05,361 --> 00:36:07,196
He has a vascular birthmark,
a port wine stain,

00:36:07,263 --> 00:36:09,732
on his upper chest--
that's what Cammie was
trying to tell me.

00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:11,400
We can get DNA
off his bloody clothes,

00:36:11,467 --> 00:36:14,270
but we have no blood or semen
at the scene to compare it to.

00:36:14,337 --> 00:36:15,805
His prints are useless--
they're all calluses.

00:36:15,872 --> 00:36:18,574
They only leave smudges,
like the kind we found
on the broken knife.

00:36:18,641 --> 00:36:21,244
I think the bastard
tried to kill himself.
Sara, slow down.

00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:23,980
Frost isn't going anywhere.
I am going to nail
this son of a bitch,

00:36:24,046 --> 00:36:26,449
and I don't want him to think
for a single second

00:36:26,516 --> 00:36:29,118
that he is going
to get away with this.
Okay, one step at a time.

00:36:29,185 --> 00:36:30,353
Frost smelled like
alcohol when they

00:36:30,419 --> 00:36:32,655
took him into the E.R,
so they ran a tox.

00:36:32,722 --> 00:36:34,524
His BAC came back .34--

00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,526
only a chronic alcoholic
can function at those levels.

00:36:36,592 --> 00:36:38,828
You know what I think?
I think <i>he</i> polished off

00:36:38,895 --> 00:36:40,930
the wine at the scene
straight from the bottle.

00:36:40,997 --> 00:36:45,034
GRISSOM:
<i>So his DNA should be on it.</i>

00:36:45,101 --> 00:36:48,871
BRASS:
<i>The suspect's name is</i>
<i>David Marlon. M-A-R-L-O-N.</i>

00:36:48,938 --> 00:36:50,506
<i>Also known as</i>

00:36:50,573 --> 00:36:51,808
Marlon Frost.

00:36:51,874 --> 00:36:53,943
Released from
California state penitentiary

00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:56,312
where he served time
for sexual assault.

00:36:56,379 --> 00:37:00,049
Mr. Marlon is also wanted in
the questioning of the assault

00:37:00,116 --> 00:37:03,286
of an elderly woman in
north Lake Tahoe one week ago.

00:37:03,352 --> 00:37:07,890
We believe he stole her vehicle
and then fled to Las Vegas.

00:37:07,957 --> 00:37:09,258
Where'd Brass find it?

00:37:09,325 --> 00:37:11,060
A block away from the bar.

00:37:11,127 --> 00:37:13,329
Guy didn't even bother
to switch plates.

00:37:13,396 --> 00:37:15,398
Smart.

00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:23,206
(chuckles):
Whoa.

00:37:23,272 --> 00:37:26,042
One, two...

00:37:26,108 --> 00:37:29,445
three, four, five, six...

00:37:29,512 --> 00:37:31,514
ladies' handbags.

00:37:36,285 --> 00:37:37,987
Rebecca Mayford.

00:37:38,054 --> 00:37:40,923
Becca.

00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:46,095
Mm. Looks like she was
trying to quit smoking.

00:37:46,162 --> 00:37:47,763
And failing.

00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,465
Miserably.

00:37:51,033 --> 00:37:52,802
There <i>is</i> only one
missing.

00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,275
Here we go.

00:37:59,342 --> 00:38:01,277
Bought at the Trip Wire Bar

00:38:01,344 --> 00:38:04,680
at 12:48 a.m.
same night as the murders.

00:38:04,747 --> 00:38:07,083
That's where Marlon and Becca
crossed paths.

00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,784
There you go.

00:38:12,188 --> 00:38:15,024
Appreciate it. Bye.

00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,340
I got a gun.

00:38:35,111 --> 00:38:37,513
It's <i>plastic.</i>

00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:41,551
It's a toy.

00:38:41,617 --> 00:38:42,952
Looks real to me.

00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:44,387
Imagine if you're petrified.

00:38:52,462 --> 00:38:54,430
How'd you find me?

00:38:54,497 --> 00:38:56,532
Cammie had these
in her wallet.

00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:59,068
We tracked you from
the birth certificate.

00:38:59,135 --> 00:39:00,970
She's a cutie.

00:39:01,037 --> 00:39:03,039
What's her name?

00:39:03,105 --> 00:39:04,540
Fin.

00:39:04,607 --> 00:39:06,909
After Cammie's grandmother.

00:39:06,976 --> 00:39:11,581
But her adoptive parents
call her Annabelle.

00:39:11,647 --> 00:39:13,349
She kept in touch with them?

00:39:13,416 --> 00:39:14,851
They're pretty cool.

00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:17,119
We didn't have contact, but...

00:39:17,186 --> 00:39:20,556
they would send Cammie a photo
every year on Fin's birthday.

00:39:20,623 --> 00:39:24,560
And every year,
Cammie and I would get together,

00:39:24,627 --> 00:39:27,430
have a beer, look at it.

00:39:28,631 --> 00:39:31,167
Biggest regret of my life

00:39:31,234 --> 00:39:35,505
is not marrying Cammie
and raising Fin together.

00:39:35,571 --> 00:39:37,840
I wanted to, but...

00:39:37,907 --> 00:39:40,143
she said we were too young.

00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:41,511
Maybe if we had...

00:39:41,577 --> 00:39:43,212
Corey...

00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:45,681
you can't blame yourself.

00:39:45,748 --> 00:39:49,285
Were you with her
when she died?

00:39:52,989 --> 00:39:56,459
At least Cammie died
knowing kindness.

00:39:56,526 --> 00:39:58,628
SIDLE:
Stay with me, Cammie.

00:39:58,694 --> 00:40:02,098
Bye... Fin...

00:40:02,165 --> 00:40:03,666
(weak gasp)

00:40:03,733 --> 00:40:05,201
(stops breathing)

00:40:05,268 --> 00:40:07,837
MARLON:
<i>I watched the life</i>
<i>go out of their eyes.</i>

00:40:07,904 --> 00:40:09,906
<i>Um, life drains.</i>

00:40:09,972 --> 00:40:12,775
That's... that's how
you can tell they're dead.

00:40:12,842 --> 00:40:15,378
They have, uh, empty eyes.

00:40:17,246 --> 00:40:19,415
BRASS:
That's not what
I asked you.

00:40:19,482 --> 00:40:23,186
What I asked you was,
why did you kill them?

00:40:23,252 --> 00:40:26,622
I saw this girl I liked
at the bar.

00:40:27,824 --> 00:40:29,826
I followed her home.

00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,796
I knew she wanted to party.

00:40:35,598 --> 00:40:37,600
I chose her.

00:40:39,702 --> 00:40:45,341
Girls act... sometimes like they
don't want what they want...

00:40:45,408 --> 00:40:48,511
because they want you
to take it.

00:40:48,578 --> 00:40:50,580
They like that.

00:40:51,747 --> 00:40:53,449
But this girl...

00:40:53,516 --> 00:40:56,586
she was flirting with me.

00:40:58,454 --> 00:41:03,693
And I... I just gave her
the party of her life.

00:41:03,759 --> 00:41:07,563
You know, there's something
I don't understand, Marlon.

00:41:09,398 --> 00:41:11,901
(whispers):
Why are you smiling?

00:41:11,968 --> 00:41:14,871
You feel good about this?

00:41:14,937 --> 00:41:17,106
I don't feel anything.

00:41:18,474 --> 00:41:20,510
Nothing.

00:41:20,576 --> 00:41:21,744
(on TV):
Las Vegas PD has confirmed

00:41:21,811 --> 00:41:24,013
that David Marlon confessed
earlier today

00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,816
to the murders of
the six Green Valley showgirls.

00:41:26,883 --> 00:41:29,652
He was found within a block
of the crime scene

00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:32,388
in an apparent suicide attempt.

00:41:32,455 --> 00:41:34,157
I've just been informed...

00:41:34,223 --> 00:41:35,992
I held his hand.

00:41:36,058 --> 00:41:38,895
...has confirmed the names
of the six victims.

00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:40,196
They are Cammie...

00:41:40,263 --> 00:41:42,431
Just like I held hers.

00:41:42,498 --> 00:41:45,835
Libby Cooperson 22,
Becca Mayfield, 20...

00:41:45,902 --> 00:41:48,171
I lost perspective.

00:41:48,237 --> 00:41:52,508
...Lauren Walderson 21
and Emily Wilson, 19.

00:41:52,575 --> 00:41:55,678
Their families have organized
a candlelight vigil

00:41:55,745 --> 00:41:58,214
that will begin here tonight.
