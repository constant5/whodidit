00:00:04,286 --> 00:00:08,673
NARRATOR (on TV):
...primarily on medium-
to large-size rodents.

00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,175
(lock beeps,
buzzes, clicks)

00:00:10,241 --> 00:00:13,111
...they will generally eat
any meat that is available...

00:00:13,178 --> 00:00:15,079
(loud slurping)

00:00:15,146 --> 00:00:17,916
(narration continues
on TV as wolves howl)

00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:26,391
(elevator bell dings,
doors open)

00:00:26,457 --> 00:00:28,459
(laughter, whooping,
hooting)

00:00:30,128 --> 00:00:32,297
MAN:
I can't believe that, man.

00:00:33,932 --> 00:00:35,934
(nature documentary
continues indistinctly on TV)

00:00:57,589 --> 00:00:59,591
(slot machines beeping)

00:01:20,044 --> 00:01:23,481
NARRATOR:
...a wolf's feeding requirements
is 1.5 tons of meat.

00:01:23,548 --> 00:01:25,950
(wolf howls on TV,
then narration continues)

00:01:27,452 --> 00:01:29,087
(gasping)

00:01:32,957 --> 00:01:34,959
Oh, my God.

00:01:35,026 --> 00:01:37,629
Oh, man. Oh, man.

00:01:37,695 --> 00:01:42,033
Security, we've got an emergency
in the-the west garden.

00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,537
Send help, please. Hurry.

00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:51,843
My supervisor's, uh, going
through all the video feeds.

00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,012
If we got her face
on one of our cameras,

00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:56,281
uh, you guys
are going to have it.

00:01:56,347 --> 00:01:57,415
You better pray
that she doesn't

00:01:57,482 --> 00:01:59,150
have a family that's
going to sue you

00:01:59,217 --> 00:02:00,618
and this whole joint
for gross negligence.

00:02:00,685 --> 00:02:01,886
Take a hike.
Go with him.

00:02:01,953 --> 00:02:03,354
LANGSTON (recorded):
Hello, this is Dr. Langston.

00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:04,856
Leave a message.

00:02:04,923 --> 00:02:07,091
Yeah, hey, Ray.
It's Jim Brass.

00:02:07,158 --> 00:02:10,762
Weren't you supposed to be here
at my 420 about an hour ago?

00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:12,530
Where the hell are you?

00:02:18,436 --> 00:02:20,238
Have you seen
this woman, sir?

00:02:20,305 --> 00:02:21,306
No, I haven't.

00:02:22,874 --> 00:02:25,043
How about you?
Have you seen this woman?
No.

00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:26,711
How about you, ladies?

00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:27,879
Hey, big fella.

00:02:27,946 --> 00:02:29,714
You want to party?

00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:31,850
I'm looking for this woman.
Her name is Madeline Briggs.

00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,117
Cop.
I'm not a cop.

00:02:33,184 --> 00:02:34,352
I'm not here
to arrest anyone.

00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:37,021
I just want to know if you've
seen this woman.

00:02:37,088 --> 00:02:39,224
I seen lots of people.

00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,793
What about her?
Have you seen her?

00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,729
Sorry. She's too pretty
to be a track ho.

00:02:44,796 --> 00:02:47,966
Um, you think you could
spare some frog skins?

00:02:48,032 --> 00:02:50,034
I ain't eaten
since yesterday.

00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:52,070
That's a pretty bad
rash you have.

00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:54,105
I work at a clinic.

00:02:54,172 --> 00:02:55,840
(siren chirps)
It's not too far from here.

00:02:55,907 --> 00:02:58,276
If you want to come over
and have that looked at...

00:02:59,277 --> 00:03:00,912
Dr. Ray.

00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:02,180
Yeah?
You got your phone?

00:03:02,247 --> 00:03:03,848
Yeah, yeah. Right here.

00:03:03,915 --> 00:03:05,383
Did you forget
how to use it?

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,685
You were nonresponsive.

00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:09,254
I thought you were
in trouble, man.

00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,555
Don't scare me like that.

00:03:10,622 --> 00:03:11,923
I'm sorry.

00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,125
That's okay, but if you
really want to hide out,

00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:15,660
you gotta ditch
the department cell.

00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:17,095
They all have GPS.

00:03:17,162 --> 00:03:18,696
What are you
doing out here?

00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:20,431
That's what I'm
doing out here.

00:03:20,498 --> 00:03:21,933
STOKES:
Madeline Briggs?

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,769
LANGSTON:
<i>Madeline Briggs, yeah.</i>

00:03:24,836 --> 00:03:26,237
STOKES:
<i>You been back for ten days.</i>

00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:28,573
<i>Is this what you've</i>
<i>been doing every night?</i>

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,608
<i>I thought the trail went cold</i>
<i>in New York.</i>

00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:31,743
LANGSTON:
<i>It did.</i>

00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:37,849
This picture was taken a week
ago at Pecos Bill Casino.

00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,852
Security trespassed her off
the property for soliciting.

00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,821
She's here, Nick.
She's hooking.

00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:44,856
Have you been
in contact with her mother?

00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:47,358
Not since New York,
but I told this woman

00:03:47,425 --> 00:03:48,993
I would do everything
I could to find her daughter.

00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,797
So... here I am.

00:03:52,864 --> 00:03:55,266
All right, tell you what.

00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:58,303
Let's take care
of the call-out first.

00:03:58,369 --> 00:04:01,606
Then after shift, hey, I'll
come back out here with you.

00:04:01,673 --> 00:04:03,541
We'll pass out some pictures
together, okay?

00:04:03,608 --> 00:04:05,577
Okay.
Okay. Come on.

00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:13,117
(siren whoops)

00:04:14,886 --> 00:04:16,721
Okay, boys,
what's happening?

00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:18,423
I mean, you know...
I don't know.

00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,491
Is everybody moving
in slow-motion?

00:04:19,557 --> 00:04:20,859
The coroner's
not even here yet.

00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:22,927
Sorry. We, uh, we got
held up. What's going on?

00:04:22,994 --> 00:04:24,529
BRASS:
We got a dead woman,

00:04:24,596 --> 00:04:27,665
no I.D. in her purse,
$40 in cash,

00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:29,934
half a dozen condoms, a few
roofies, and some baby wipes.

00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:31,102
What does that tell you?

00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:32,837
Standard hooker tool kit.

00:04:32,904 --> 00:04:35,773
$20 for cab fare, $20 for the
bartender to look the other way.

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,409
Which means she probably
hasn't tricked yet.

00:04:38,476 --> 00:04:39,677
Well, it looks like

00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:41,446
word's already gotten
out on the ho-vine.

00:04:41,513 --> 00:04:42,647
The "ho-vine"?
Yeah, you know,

00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:44,516
when the hookers get wind
the cops are here,

00:04:44,582 --> 00:04:46,484
they start texting
each other like mad

00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:48,786
and then they, they book out
of here like a shot.

00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:50,655
So I'm going to go
catch up with them,

00:04:50,722 --> 00:04:52,257
see if I can get
some information.
I'm out.

00:04:52,323 --> 00:04:53,258
All right.

00:04:53,324 --> 00:04:56,094
Okay.

00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:58,496
Throat is cut clean, linear.

00:04:58,563 --> 00:05:00,098
My guess would be

00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:02,133
a straight razor
severed the common carotid.

00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,135
There're a lot of ways
in and out of here.

00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:06,337
Killer could have come
from any direction.

00:05:10,074 --> 00:05:12,343
Arterial spurt like this,

00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,779
usually they at least get
some blood on their shoes.

00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:16,881
I don't see
any tread marks.

00:05:16,948 --> 00:05:18,416
PHILLIPS:
Hey, guys.

00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:19,918
I'm so sorry I'm late.

00:05:19,984 --> 00:05:22,520
I was on that biker shoot-out
up in Pahrump.

00:05:22,587 --> 00:05:23,788
Lots of gurney work.

00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:25,356
It's all right, David.

00:05:25,423 --> 00:05:26,791
Whoa!

00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:28,026
This is Dede Chase.

00:05:28,092 --> 00:05:29,294
Who?

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,895
Dede Chase. She's the, uh,

00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:33,531
meteorologist on Channel 27
in Barstow.

00:05:33,598 --> 00:05:35,467
You sure about that?
Definitely.

00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:37,836
Why do you watch the weather
in Barstow?

00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:39,704
Dede always made me laugh.

00:05:39,771 --> 00:05:41,339
She was kind of
daffy, you know?

00:05:41,406 --> 00:05:43,041
What's a weather girl

00:05:43,107 --> 00:05:46,077
from Barstow doing
turning tricks in Las Vegas?

00:05:46,144 --> 00:05:49,380
These days...

00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:52,083
seems like everybody
has a second job.

SANDERS: Took a lot of makeup
to cover these bruises.

00:06:27,046 --> 00:06:28,948
I collected the SAE kit.

00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:32,718
There were vaginal abrasions
at 3:00 and 4:00 to 8:00,

00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:35,321
consistent with
violent sexual activity.

00:06:35,388 --> 00:06:37,890
And the wet mount
was negative,

00:06:37,957 --> 00:06:40,726
so no DNA on whoever
she was with.

00:06:40,793 --> 00:06:43,329
Lots of purplish-blue
contusions.

00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:45,665
Somebody worked her over
pretty good,

00:06:45,731 --> 00:06:47,834
most likely
within the last day or two.

00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,102
Tat is still fresh, too.

00:06:49,168 --> 00:06:51,337
Skin's still inflamed.

00:06:51,404 --> 00:06:53,873
Ink can't be more
than 48 hours old.

00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,576
Guys, take a look at this.

00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:01,314
Oh, we have a fabulous weekend
ahead of us

00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,282
with highs in the upper 70s,

00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:05,618
lows in the mid-40s, though,
so bring a jacket

00:07:05,685 --> 00:07:08,187
if you'll be staying out late.
I know I will be.

00:07:08,254 --> 00:07:09,589
That's your high desert weather.

00:07:09,655 --> 00:07:11,591
I'm Dede Kase. Chase.

00:07:11,657 --> 00:07:13,659
D... Dede Chase.

00:07:13,726 --> 00:07:17,430
Wow, of all the things to screw
up, I choose my own name.

00:07:17,497 --> 00:07:19,565
I'm Dede... Chase.

00:07:19,632 --> 00:07:21,400
(on video):
I think.
I'm sorry,

00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:23,236
but I don't believe
Dede was a hooker.

00:07:23,302 --> 00:07:27,306
Maybe she just liked things
a little dangerous.

00:07:27,373 --> 00:07:29,642
WILLOWS: Well, certainly
wouldn't be the first
time a good girl

00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:32,645
starts looking for love
in all the wrong places.

00:07:32,712 --> 00:07:36,382
There is blood
on this earring.

00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:39,051
But I only saw blood on
that side of her face.

00:07:39,118 --> 00:07:41,120
Well, straight razors
are hard to handle.

00:07:41,187 --> 00:07:42,955
People cut themselves
with them all the time.

00:07:43,022 --> 00:07:44,657
So, this blood could
be the killer's.

00:07:44,724 --> 00:07:46,793
Mmm. Swab it.

00:07:46,859 --> 00:07:49,395
LANGSTON: There's no image
of the killer.

00:07:49,462 --> 00:07:51,063
The camera
is completely blocked.

00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,899
Can we see how
she got there?
Yes.

00:07:52,965 --> 00:07:56,302
Tangiers surveillance
was very cooperative.

00:07:58,137 --> 00:08:00,306
STOKES:
We know who that is?

00:08:00,373 --> 00:08:01,908
Now, don't
get excited.

00:08:01,974 --> 00:08:04,043
He's on surveillance
playing roulette

00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,511
at the time of the murder.

00:08:05,578 --> 00:08:06,746
He's a hotel guest.

00:08:06,813 --> 00:08:07,847
Brass took his
statement.

00:08:07,914 --> 00:08:09,182
He said he picked

00:08:09,248 --> 00:08:10,450
the girl up at the bar,

00:08:10,516 --> 00:08:12,251
they went upstairs,
and she split.

00:08:12,318 --> 00:08:14,821
Now, this is
the earliest

00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:16,923
we can put Dede Chase
in the hotel.

00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:19,459
Okay...
so she meets a guy in the bar,

00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:21,027
they head up to his room.

00:08:21,094 --> 00:08:23,262
Right. There's no sign
of violence, no argument,

00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:26,099
nothing inconsistent with
a woman out for a fling.

00:08:28,868 --> 00:08:31,137
That elevator is in
the south tower.

00:08:31,204 --> 00:08:32,605
She came down

00:08:32,672 --> 00:08:33,940
the elevator
in the north tower.

00:08:34,006 --> 00:08:35,875
Means she ran
all the way across the hotel

00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:37,110
just to leave?

00:08:37,176 --> 00:08:38,644
But if she got
cold feet,

00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:40,480
why not just take
the next car down?

00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:41,914
That's a good question.

00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:45,151
You know, maybe

00:08:45,218 --> 00:08:47,620
this pickup in the
bar was a cover.

00:08:47,687 --> 00:08:49,388
Maybe she was running
from somebody.

00:08:49,455 --> 00:08:52,358
Somebody who was already
down there waiting for her.

00:08:52,425 --> 00:08:54,761
If you're going to have me
keep doing Archie's job,

00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:56,195
I'm going to
need a raise.

00:08:56,262 --> 00:08:58,831
Let me know
what Ecklie says to that.

00:08:58,898 --> 00:09:01,501
I was hoping you'd ask,
Herr Supervisor.

00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:02,802
Yeah, well, it's
good to, uh...

00:09:02,869 --> 00:09:04,270
it's good to
hope for things.

00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:08,574
Here's the dump
on your vic's cell phone.

00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:10,610
In the three days
prior to her death,

00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:13,412
she received 28 phone
calls from a cell phone

00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:16,382
out of Barstow, registered
to one Brett McDowell.

00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:19,652
I wonder if he's
the jealous, violent type.

00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:21,187
Well, shouldn't be hard
to find out.

00:09:21,254 --> 00:09:22,555
I trapped his plastic.

00:09:22,622 --> 00:09:24,090
His credit card was just run

00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:25,658
at the Four Kings.

00:09:25,725 --> 00:09:27,193
He's in town.

00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,103
Enjoying your time in Vegas,
Mr. McDowell?

00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,604
Uh, yeah, I guess.

00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:40,006
What is this about?

00:09:40,072 --> 00:09:41,107
What's your relationship
to Dede Chase?

00:09:41,174 --> 00:09:42,742
We're colleagues.

00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:44,110
I'm her producer.

00:09:44,177 --> 00:09:45,545
Were you banging her?

00:09:45,611 --> 00:09:47,046
(scoffs)
Excuse me?

00:09:47,113 --> 00:09:48,181
Listen to this.

00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:50,016
Dede, damn it,
you do not call my house.

00:09:50,082 --> 00:09:51,384
You do it ever again,

00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:53,352
and I promise you
there will be consequences.

00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:56,222
There's a lot more
like this on this tape.

00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:58,091
Now, I see that you've, uh,
taken off

00:09:58,157 --> 00:09:59,358
your wedding ring
recently.

00:09:59,425 --> 00:10:00,460
So, you're married.

00:10:00,526 --> 00:10:02,295
Does your wife know
about these phone calls?

00:10:02,361 --> 00:10:04,630
Okay. Okay.

00:10:04,697 --> 00:10:08,067
Look, uh, Dede and I
were having an affair.

00:10:08,134 --> 00:10:09,902
That's a good place to start.

00:10:09,969 --> 00:10:11,804
We came to Vegas to
resolve a few issues.

00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:13,239
She wanted me to
get a divorce,

00:10:13,306 --> 00:10:14,874
and, you know, I couldn't
afford that, so...

00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:16,209
When was the last time
you saw her?

00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:17,443
Three nights ago.

00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,245
Where was that?

00:10:19,312 --> 00:10:20,880
On the street.

00:10:20,947 --> 00:10:22,582
DEDE: Yeah.
BRETT: Yeah? Great.
This is what I want.

00:10:22,648 --> 00:10:23,983
I want you out now.

00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,619
Oh! Well, why don't you
just go to hell!

00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:28,154
Just go to hell
while you're at it!

00:10:28,221 --> 00:10:29,322
Why don't you just do that?

00:10:29,388 --> 00:10:30,389
(engine revving)

00:10:32,358 --> 00:10:34,427
She told me to go to hell,
so I drove back to Barstow.

00:10:34,494 --> 00:10:35,795
So, you left her

00:10:35,862 --> 00:10:37,864
on a street corner in
a strange town, all by herself?

00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:38,965
That's why I came back.

00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:40,066
I got worried, you know.

00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:41,467
She didn't show up to work,

00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:43,669
and she wasn't returning
any of my calls.

00:10:43,736 --> 00:10:45,605
Well, she had a good reason.

00:10:45,671 --> 00:10:47,140
You thought she
was going to make good

00:10:47,206 --> 00:10:48,508
on her threat
and send your marriage

00:10:48,574 --> 00:10:50,143
and half your assets
down the toilet,

00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:51,711
so you decided
to cut your losses

00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:53,579
along with her throat--
is that what you did?

00:10:53,646 --> 00:10:55,481
I would never do anything
like that. I swear.

00:10:55,548 --> 00:10:56,783
I'm going to need
your DNA.

00:10:56,849 --> 00:10:58,417
I'm going to need a list
of all the people

00:10:58,484 --> 00:10:59,452
you met when you were here

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,988
and all the places
you went.

00:11:02,054 --> 00:11:04,457
That means bars,
restaurants, hotels,

00:11:04,524 --> 00:11:05,958
tattoo parlors, clubs.

00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:08,227
Tattoo parlors?
What are you talking about?

00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:09,429
Well, there is some evidence

00:11:09,495 --> 00:11:11,364
that she got a tattoo
in the last two days.

00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:12,965
She hated tattoos.

00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:15,768
She thought they made women
look cheap.

00:11:53,739 --> 00:11:54,807
Ray.
Yeah?

00:11:54,874 --> 00:11:56,576
I think you need
to see this.
What is it?

00:11:56,642 --> 00:11:58,544
The DNA from the blood
on the weather girl's earring--

00:11:58,611 --> 00:11:59,879
it wasn't hers,
it wasn't Brett McDowell's.

00:11:59,946 --> 00:12:02,782
It's Madeline Briggs.

00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,970
Okay, Madeline Briggs and Dede
Chase-- what's the connection?

00:12:11,995 --> 00:12:13,363
Madeline Briggs fell prey

00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,165
to an interstate
human trafficking ring.

00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,766
Took her from Miami

00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,301
to New York
to Las Vegas,

00:12:18,368 --> 00:12:19,903
where she was probably forced
into prostitution.

00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,104
SANDERS:
Her blood was found

00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:23,773
on an earring worn
by Dede Chase,

00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,909
a TV weather girl
from Barstow.

00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:28,111
Who ended up with
her throat slit

00:12:28,178 --> 00:12:29,746
in the Tangiers
garden,

00:12:29,813 --> 00:12:32,749
sporting a new tattoo associated
with known prostitutes.

00:12:32,816 --> 00:12:36,286
So, how did she cross
paths with Madeline?

00:12:36,353 --> 00:12:38,321
Well, you said
that the earring

00:12:38,388 --> 00:12:40,090
belonged to Madeline, right?

00:12:40,156 --> 00:12:41,558
Right.
Well, if she
and Dede

00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,692
were sharing jewelry,

00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,394
it suggests they
were living together.

00:12:44,461 --> 00:12:46,830
So, maybe they
had the same pimp.

00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:49,666
Possibly, but the Vice tattoo
database didn't I.D. the pimp.

00:12:49,733 --> 00:12:52,402
What's today's date?

00:12:52,469 --> 00:12:53,637
The 15th.

00:12:53,703 --> 00:12:55,205
Why?
I think I know

00:12:55,272 --> 00:12:57,407
where we can find a lot
of pimps tonight.

00:12:57,474 --> 00:13:00,176
(hip-hop playing)

00:13:05,715 --> 00:13:09,953
By all means, LVPD,
feel free to look around.

00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,688
But we ain't got none
of them real-life,

00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:13,423
lawbreaking kind of pimps
in here.

00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,226
This here
is DJ Tall-K's PlayerCon.

00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:17,694
No, right, I understand.

00:13:17,761 --> 00:13:19,296
This is, uh--
technically speaking--

00:13:19,362 --> 00:13:21,431
just an elaborate costume party.

00:13:21,498 --> 00:13:23,433
WOMAN (over P.A.):
...peoples, it's my honor

00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,003
to present the Golden Pimp Award
to DJ Slickbone!

00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,773
(crowd whistling, applauding)

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,045
All right, y'all, give it up
for Daddy of the Year!

00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:37,948
SLICKBONE: Winning the Golden
Pimp as Daddy of the Year,

00:13:38,014 --> 00:13:40,216
is a honor for DJ Slickbone,

00:13:40,283 --> 00:13:43,954
'cause pimping ain't just
about sex and bling.

00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,823
It's about standing up
to The Man

00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,225
and shaking off
that slave mentality.

00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:50,527
Touch.

00:13:50,594 --> 00:13:51,995
(hip-hop playing)

00:13:52,062 --> 00:13:53,296
Nah, baby, baby, listen.

00:13:53,363 --> 00:13:56,032
See, I'm what you call...
(clears throat)

00:13:56,099 --> 00:13:58,068
a life improvement coach.

00:13:59,102 --> 00:14:01,371
It ain't all
about business with me.

00:14:01,438 --> 00:14:03,173
I love my wifeys.

00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:04,841
Back in my
dancing days,

00:14:04,908 --> 00:14:06,943
pimps would come into
the club to recruit.

00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,244
They just have a gift

00:14:08,311 --> 00:14:10,347
for sniffing out the
damaged and needy.

00:14:10,413 --> 00:14:13,116
That's what it's
all about: love.

00:14:13,183 --> 00:14:15,251
And I'm getting
a vibe from you

00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:17,153
that you haven't
always got enough,

00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,555
especially from
your father.

00:14:18,622 --> 00:14:19,623
Am I right?

00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:20,690
Mm-hmm.

00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,793
♪ ♪

00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,203
Americans
are so puritanical.

00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,438
You need to open your mind.

00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:39,142
This is a Dionysian festival,
a celebration of life

00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:41,778
that stretches back
thousands of years.

00:14:41,845 --> 00:14:43,980
The ancient Greeks
greeted the spring...

00:14:46,182 --> 00:14:47,984
Well, we talked to
a few of the girls

00:14:48,051 --> 00:14:49,886
with the heart and
diamond tattoos,

00:14:49,953 --> 00:14:51,554
but nobody
knows nothin'

00:14:51,621 --> 00:14:53,490
about pimps or hos
in this place.

00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:54,891
Well, we could just haul

00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,960
the whole lot of them in
for questioning.

00:14:57,027 --> 00:14:58,962
BRASS:
No, that won't work.

00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:00,797
These girls are used
to being rousted,

00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:02,365
plus we have
no leverage.

00:15:02,432 --> 00:15:04,200
I don't know-- maybe we do.

00:15:04,267 --> 00:15:05,802
I've got an idea.

00:15:05,869 --> 00:15:07,871
That's one of our
tattoo ladies.

00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:10,607
Let's go talk to that
girl onstage, Jim.

00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:20,550
Las Vegas Police, ma'am.

00:15:20,617 --> 00:15:22,252
We have reason
to believe that you

00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:24,020
are holding
a controlled substance.

00:15:24,087 --> 00:15:25,322
Oh, no, not me, sir.
(chuckles)

00:15:25,388 --> 00:15:27,123
STOKES:
You know what I love
about science?

00:15:28,124 --> 00:15:29,759
It doesn't lie.

00:15:29,826 --> 00:15:31,294
Hey, I earned that.

00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:33,129
I don't mind
paying a ho-tax

00:15:33,196 --> 00:15:36,700
on a straight-up bust,
but this is bogus.

00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:39,235
Look at that--

00:15:39,302 --> 00:15:40,837
positive for cocaine.

00:15:40,904 --> 00:15:42,772
BRASS:
I guess this means
you're under arrest.

00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,041
Come with us.

00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:53,650
Hello, Mrs. Briggs.

00:15:53,717 --> 00:15:55,318
Why didn't you let me know
that Madeline

00:15:55,385 --> 00:15:57,087
had been photographed
in one of your casinos?

00:15:57,153 --> 00:15:58,855
Mrs. Briggs, what
are you doing here?

00:15:58,922 --> 00:16:01,925
You said you would let me know
if there were any developments.

00:16:01,992 --> 00:16:03,226
Do... Do you think I'm just

00:16:03,293 --> 00:16:04,728
sitting at home
waiting by the phone?

00:16:04,794 --> 00:16:07,297
I have been on every
law enforcement Web site

00:16:07,364 --> 00:16:08,632
and Listserv across the country.

00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:10,166
I know how to network.

00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:11,334
I understand, and I apologize.

00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:12,802
I should have let you know.

00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,506
We have some evidence
that Madeline

00:16:16,573 --> 00:16:18,174
was in Las Vegas.

00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:20,410
It was about a week ago.

00:16:20,477 --> 00:16:22,812
It may no longer be the
case, you understand?

00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:25,582
This is not something that
you can pin your hopes to.

00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:28,218
Okay, just don't decide
what information

00:16:28,285 --> 00:16:30,687
I am capable of handling,
all right?

00:16:38,828 --> 00:16:40,964
She's...

00:16:41,031 --> 00:16:42,065
She's with a cop.

00:16:42,132 --> 00:16:43,500
They would have
let her call me.

00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:46,036
Why didn't she call me?

00:16:46,102 --> 00:16:47,470
I would have come.

00:16:47,537 --> 00:16:48,805
I would have...

00:16:48,872 --> 00:16:50,740
brought her back home.

00:16:53,376 --> 00:16:56,446
Oh, God,
I don't care what she's done.

00:16:56,513 --> 00:16:59,115
I just want
to bring my Maddy home.

00:17:01,952 --> 00:17:03,753
This was recorded at the
Clark County Detention Center

00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,821
about an hour ago.

00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:06,089
Go ahead and play it.

00:17:06,156 --> 00:17:08,591
WOMAN:
I'm so, so sorry
to bug you, Daddy.

00:17:08,658 --> 00:17:10,427
It's just, I'm really scared.

00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:13,263
MAN:
Bitch, I told you never
to call me from in there.

00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,898
They hear everything we say.

00:17:14,965 --> 00:17:17,667
They said that my money
tested positive for coke.

00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:19,035
They said that
that means hard time.

00:17:19,102 --> 00:17:21,671
Every bill in America
has cocaine on it.

00:17:21,738 --> 00:17:22,772
Stupid bitch!

00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,240
(click, dial tone)

00:17:24,307 --> 00:17:26,242
So, did you trace the call?
(cell phone beeping)

00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:28,345
It went to a disposable cell.
There was no address.

00:17:28,411 --> 00:17:30,347
Someone just came in here

00:17:30,413 --> 00:17:32,582
to post
Diane Jasper's bail.

00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:35,585
Oh. Daddy sent someone
to bring wifey home.

00:17:35,652 --> 00:17:37,754
Must really love her.

00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,740

00:18:17,994 --> 00:18:20,297
(camera shutter clicking)

00:18:20,363 --> 00:18:22,165
SANDERS (over radio):
The woman who posted bail

00:18:22,232 --> 00:18:23,433
is Susan Samuels.

00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,101
Career prostitute.

00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:27,203
Busts for narcotics
and solicitation

00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,773
spanning over three decades,

00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:31,474
but nothing recent.

00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,677
The house belongs to her.

00:18:33,743 --> 00:18:36,346
She has a son, Anthony, 28.

00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:38,048
No criminal record.

00:18:38,114 --> 00:18:41,785
And, apart from a brief stint
in the food service industry,

00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:43,586
no employment history, either.

00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:45,922
Best guess is mom retired

00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:48,391
and left Anthony
the family business.

00:18:49,426 --> 00:18:51,328
We need to get into that house.

00:18:51,394 --> 00:18:52,696
I know.

00:18:52,762 --> 00:18:55,432
LANGSTON:
Any judges owe you favors, Jim?

00:18:55,498 --> 00:18:56,900
BRASS:
Everybody owes me a favor.

00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:58,535
But we gotta sit
on this place

00:18:58,602 --> 00:19:02,038
until we can get enough probable
cause for a warrant.

00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:04,474
SANDERS:
I think I've got something.

00:19:08,111 --> 00:19:10,080
He's wearing
Madeline Briggs' earring.

00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,719
OFFICER:
You! Get up!
Stand up!

00:19:15,785 --> 00:19:17,454
Las Vegas Police!

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,356
Remain calm.
We have a warrant to
search the premises.

00:19:19,422 --> 00:19:20,890
OFFICER:
Put the bottle down.

00:19:20,957 --> 00:19:23,059
All right,yo, yo, yo, yo.
Let me see your hands!
Get 'em up!

00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:24,728
Everybody be cool, okay?

00:19:24,794 --> 00:19:26,529
This is my mom's house.

00:19:26,596 --> 00:19:28,164
I'm just visiting.
OFFICER: Clear!

00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:30,967
You gonna let me
put my shirt on?
No.

00:19:31,034 --> 00:19:32,836
No? That's what's up?

00:19:32,902 --> 00:19:34,738
Put your hands up.

00:19:36,773 --> 00:19:38,775
(woman moaning and groaning)

00:19:51,988 --> 00:19:53,490
We need the paramedics
in here.

00:19:53,556 --> 00:19:56,426
We have an injured woman
on the first floor.

00:19:58,261 --> 00:20:00,263
Can you say
your name?

00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,432
Diane.

00:20:05,168 --> 00:20:08,271
LANGSTON:
We're looking for this woman.

00:20:08,338 --> 00:20:11,074
Her name is
Madeline Briggs.

00:20:11,141 --> 00:20:14,844
Now, if any of you
have seen her,

00:20:14,911 --> 00:20:17,614
we want to know.

00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:19,582
It might make things
easier on you.

00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:20,784
That's right, ladies.

00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,852
You help out the cops
in any way you can.

00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:24,921
OFFICER:
Get back in line!

00:20:26,823 --> 00:20:29,559
(dog barking in distance)

(camera shutter clicking)

00:22:19,093 --> 00:22:20,861
You know, you and I have
a lot more in common

00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,362
than you may think.

00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:24,164
Both of us are in the
family business, right?

00:22:24,231 --> 00:22:25,566
I mean, look at me,

00:22:25,632 --> 00:22:28,035
my uncle was a cop,
my older brother became a cop

00:22:28,102 --> 00:22:29,169
and then me.

00:22:29,236 --> 00:22:30,504
If I were in your family,

00:22:30,571 --> 00:22:33,240
I'd be a sorry-ass
sleazeball pimp, like you.

00:22:33,307 --> 00:22:34,675
I'm not a pimp.

00:22:34,741 --> 00:22:36,777
Oh, come on, playa, you live
with a bunch of prostitutes.

00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:40,247
Hey, playa,
that's just who I am.

00:22:40,314 --> 00:22:41,615
I like bangin'
strippers and whores.

00:22:41,682 --> 00:22:42,950
You like to beat
them up, too, right?

00:22:43,016 --> 00:22:44,818
Like Diane Jasper.

00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:47,321
I had nothing
to do with that.
Oh, come on...

00:22:47,387 --> 00:22:48,989
Them other bitches did it,
man, they crazy.

00:22:49,056 --> 00:22:50,390
They always doing
crap like that.

00:22:50,457 --> 00:22:52,993
Your fingerprints are all over
the baseball bat.

00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,096
We got a lot of
goodies on you, man.

00:22:56,163 --> 00:22:57,664
You know what we found
in your barbecue?

00:22:57,731 --> 00:23:00,234
67 G's in cash!

00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,669
You got 13 G's
in chips in there.

00:23:02,736 --> 00:23:04,338
I mean, there goes
the defense fund.

00:23:04,404 --> 00:23:05,672
We also found

00:23:05,739 --> 00:23:08,442
Dede Chase's driver's license.

00:23:08,509 --> 00:23:10,010
How did that get in there?

00:23:10,077 --> 00:23:12,079
Dede partied with my girls
for a couple days.
Oh, yeah.

00:23:12,146 --> 00:23:13,647
Asked me to hold on
to her valuables

00:23:13,714 --> 00:23:15,382
while she went clubbing.
Did she also ask you

00:23:15,449 --> 00:23:17,751
to beat her, rape her
and slit her throat?

00:23:17,818 --> 00:23:19,486
Hey, hey, hey, hey, whoa.
Huh?

00:23:19,553 --> 00:23:20,821
I was at Tall-K's PlayerCon

00:23:20,888 --> 00:23:22,055
the night she got killed,
a'ight?

00:23:22,122 --> 00:23:24,091
A lot of people saw me.

00:23:24,158 --> 00:23:25,192
They saw you
wearing an earring

00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:28,128
that belonged to
Madeline Briggs.

00:23:28,195 --> 00:23:30,230
She one of your girls?

00:23:30,297 --> 00:23:31,398
Nah...

00:23:31,465 --> 00:23:33,300
I, uh...

00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:35,202
I think Mom brought her by.

00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:36,970
You know, Mom's always
bringing in strays.

00:23:37,037 --> 00:23:39,673
They crash for a couple days
and then they move on.

00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,041
They give me stuff.

00:23:41,108 --> 00:23:42,109
Do you know where she is?

00:23:46,046 --> 00:23:47,381
Okay, let me tell you something.

00:23:47,448 --> 00:23:50,217
If that is her blood
in your place,

00:23:50,284 --> 00:23:52,820
you're in such
deep trouble.

00:23:52,886 --> 00:23:55,589
Give me a lawyer.

00:23:55,656 --> 00:23:58,592
WILLOWS:
Diane...

00:23:58,659 --> 00:24:00,294
Diane, we need your help.

00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,830
No.

00:24:02,896 --> 00:24:04,064
Don't want more trouble.

00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:06,233
We want to put
Anthony Samuels away

00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,402
so he can't hurt you
or anybody else ever again.

00:24:08,469 --> 00:24:11,271
My fault.

00:24:11,338 --> 00:24:12,906
I shouldn't have
called from jail.

00:24:12,973 --> 00:24:15,943
Now, I have to earn
back my hair.

00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:18,879
How am I gonna earn like this?

00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:21,482
Diane,
you don't have to.

00:24:21,548 --> 00:24:23,350
We're gonna help you
get out of the game.

00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:25,352
You can go back to school.

00:24:25,419 --> 00:24:26,754
You can get a straight job.

00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,323
Will you help Anthony, too?

00:24:30,357 --> 00:24:32,126
Diane.

00:24:32,192 --> 00:24:34,828
Anthony's a sociopath.

00:24:34,895 --> 00:24:36,997
We believe that
he murdered Dede Chase.

00:24:37,064 --> 00:24:38,332
He'd never do
anything like that.

00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:39,666
You don't know him.

00:24:39,733 --> 00:24:41,201
Diane,
he almost killed you.

00:24:41,268 --> 00:24:45,339
Anthony risked his life for me.

00:24:45,405 --> 00:24:49,376
That Russian could've put him
in a hole in the desert.

00:24:49,443 --> 00:24:52,813
That Russian has a lot
of holes for people

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,581
who cross him,
but Anthony didn't care.

00:24:54,648 --> 00:24:56,150
He fought for me!

00:24:56,216 --> 00:24:57,251
Okay, who's the Russian?

00:24:59,353 --> 00:25:01,121
Before you joined
Anthony's family,

00:25:01,188 --> 00:25:02,990
did you work for somebody else?

00:25:03,056 --> 00:25:05,692
No, I was solo.

00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:07,394
I was a renegade.

00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:09,430
Please go.

00:25:13,233 --> 00:25:15,502
Let me see your tattoo.
Don't touch me!

00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:17,471
Nurse, nurse!
Don't touch me!
Get away!

00:25:17,538 --> 00:25:19,306
Nurse!

00:25:19,373 --> 00:25:21,875
Get away from me!

00:25:21,942 --> 00:25:24,077
Get away from me!

00:25:24,144 --> 00:25:26,180
I don't want you in here!

00:25:26,246 --> 00:25:28,348
Get out of here!

00:25:28,415 --> 00:25:30,884
Get out of here.

00:25:33,754 --> 00:25:36,457
You're messing everything up.

00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:41,261
Anthony...

00:25:41,328 --> 00:25:44,031
He loves me.

00:25:53,273 --> 00:25:54,942
Thanks.

00:25:55,008 --> 00:25:57,444
Nick.

00:25:57,511 --> 00:25:59,379
Help me roll her over.

00:26:05,652 --> 00:26:07,554
This tattoo,

00:26:07,621 --> 00:26:09,089
it's larger than the ones

00:26:09,156 --> 00:26:10,357
on Anthony's
other girls.

00:26:10,424 --> 00:26:11,592
Yeah, what's that tell you?

00:26:11,658 --> 00:26:14,862
Usually, when a girl
leaves her pimp,

00:26:14,928 --> 00:26:16,463
the new daddy gets rid of

00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,932
the old one's brand.

00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:21,268
Either with, I don't know,
a hot iron

00:26:21,335 --> 00:26:23,570
or battery acid
or a cheese grater.

00:26:23,637 --> 00:26:26,006
There's no evidence of
anything like that here.

00:26:26,073 --> 00:26:27,474
That's right.

00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:30,711
Which makes me believe that
Anthony just covered it up.

00:26:30,778 --> 00:26:33,247
Since tattoo inks
vary among artists,

00:26:33,313 --> 00:26:36,417
they should fluoresce
differently under different
wavelengths of light.

00:26:48,729 --> 00:26:50,297
You know...

00:26:50,364 --> 00:26:53,534
pimps treat these girls
like livestock.

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,803
Back in the Old West,
if another rancher

00:26:55,869 --> 00:26:58,572
stole another man's cattle
and tried to rebrand them,

00:26:58,639 --> 00:27:01,275
it'd start a range war.

00:27:04,378 --> 00:27:07,014
SIMMS: The samples that you took
from these satellite stains

00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,649
came from one contributor.

00:27:08,715 --> 00:27:10,317
Madeline Briggs.

00:27:10,384 --> 00:27:12,119
Yeah, it's exactly
what you thought.

00:27:12,186 --> 00:27:14,321
But then this large
stain right here,

00:27:14,388 --> 00:27:17,291
it was actually from
two contributors,

00:27:17,357 --> 00:27:19,993
so, I subtracted out
Madeline's profile from the mix,

00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,528
and I got this.

00:27:21,595 --> 00:27:23,130
13 alleles in common.

00:27:23,197 --> 00:27:25,065
That's a parent-child
relationship.

00:27:25,132 --> 00:27:28,068
CSI New York discovered
that Madeline was pregnant.

00:27:28,135 --> 00:27:30,104
That blood is from
a miscarriage?

00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:33,440
Anthony Samuels buys Madeline

00:27:33,507 --> 00:27:34,942
from the Miami-New York
traffickers.

00:27:35,008 --> 00:27:36,443
According to Vice,

00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:40,948
the going price
is ten grand.

Dimitri Sadesky.

00:29:22,616 --> 00:29:24,685

00:29:24,752 --> 00:29:27,721

confused with someone else.

00:29:27,788 --> 00:29:29,490
So, how's it work
in the pimp world, huh?

00:29:29,556 --> 00:29:31,058
To discourage poaching,

00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:33,527
if he takes one of your girls,
you take one of his?

00:29:33,594 --> 00:29:36,263
I'm sure I don't know,
but I wonder,

00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,933
what has become of loyalty, hmm?

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,404
An organization invests time
and money training an employee,

00:29:44,471 --> 00:29:48,642
and the moment they get
the better offer, they bolt.

00:29:48,709 --> 00:29:50,711
How are we ever going to

00:29:50,778 --> 00:29:52,713

00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,815

00:29:54,882 --> 00:29:57,184
That's very poetic,
but it's not an answer.

You know, Vice told me
that five years ago,

00:30:24,711 --> 00:30:26,480
you were handing out flyers
outside a strip club.

00:30:26,547 --> 00:30:28,582
Now here you are

00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:32,086
up in 10,000 square feet

00:30:32,152 --> 00:30:34,521

for an old Soviet lit professor

00:30:34,588 --> 00:30:36,090

Too long to be Madeline.

00:38:57,233 --> 00:38:59,102
The girl meant something
to you, huh?

00:38:59,169 --> 00:39:01,171
Dimitri...

00:39:02,272 --> 00:39:04,240
I can see that.

00:39:04,307 --> 00:39:06,743
Fine.

00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,746
As a token of
my good faith,

00:39:09,813 --> 00:39:11,781
I'll tell you what
I did with her.

00:39:11,848 --> 00:39:13,650
I'm listening.

00:39:13,717 --> 00:39:15,151
Nothing.

00:39:15,218 --> 00:39:17,087
Her blood was in your car.

00:39:17,153 --> 00:39:18,321
How do you explain that?

00:39:18,388 --> 00:39:21,324
She was a peace offering
from Anthony,

00:39:21,391 --> 00:39:24,828
in exchange for stealing
Diane from me.

00:39:24,894 --> 00:39:26,196
I accepted this.

00:39:26,262 --> 00:39:29,866
But... only to save face.

00:39:29,933 --> 00:39:34,437
<i>I could see he had destroyed</i>
<i>her commercial value.</i>

00:39:34,504 --> 00:39:37,607
<i>She knew nothing of me</i>
<i>or my operation,</i>

00:39:37,674 --> 00:39:40,644
<i>so, easiest thing to do...</i>

00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,046
<i>was let her go.</i>

00:39:51,554 --> 00:39:55,492
So... I'm not such a
hard-hearted guy, huh?

00:39:55,558 --> 00:39:57,560
(chuckles)

00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,969
WILLOWS:
Well, well, well.

00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:08,004
HODGES:
It's not Christmas yet.

00:40:08,071 --> 00:40:10,006
Aren't we lucky?

00:40:10,073 --> 00:40:12,008
What is this stuff?

00:40:12,075 --> 00:40:14,044
Uh, Langston sent us
some souvenirs

00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,146
from Miami
and New York.
Oh.

00:40:16,212 --> 00:40:17,747
WILLOWS:
Oh.

00:40:17,814 --> 00:40:19,516
I was kind of hoping for
a little somethin'-somethin'

00:40:19,582 --> 00:40:20,784
from Bergdorf's.

00:40:22,252 --> 00:40:24,187
SIMMS:
I love this.

00:40:24,254 --> 00:40:26,356
How do I look?

00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:28,391
SANDERS:
Bitchin'.
Oh... ridiculous.

00:40:30,393 --> 00:40:32,495
LANGSTON: The names Dimitri
gave us are going to help Miami

00:40:32,562 --> 00:40:34,664
and New York roll up most of
the human trafficking syndicate.

00:40:34,731 --> 00:40:36,933
Oh, so we did some good.

00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,935
Not good enough.

00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:40,470
Look, if Dimitri
really set her free,

00:40:40,537 --> 00:40:42,272
then why didn't
Madeline go home?

00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:44,975
Well, a lot of girls that try
to get out of that life

00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:47,177
come out feeling so
degraded and ashamed,

00:40:47,243 --> 00:40:48,511
they feel like, sometimes,

00:40:48,578 --> 00:40:50,113
nobody will ever
want them again.

00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,182
You know what I mean?

00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:56,553
Yeah.

00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,988
What are you doing?
Using the ho-vine.

00:41:32,055 --> 00:41:34,024
The phones we recovered
in Anthony's house

00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:35,425
all had the same numbers

00:41:35,492 --> 00:41:37,594
programmed into them.

00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,963
He must've given one of
them to each of his girls.

00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,998
You think Madeline
still has hers.

00:41:42,065 --> 00:41:45,068
It's good to hope
for things, right?

00:42:15,031 --> 00:42:17,033
♪ ♪

00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,632
♪ ♪

00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:53,470
Madeline.

00:42:53,536 --> 00:42:55,705
(voice breaking):
You're Langston?

00:42:55,772 --> 00:42:58,375
Yes.

00:42:58,441 --> 00:43:02,212
How can I go back after
everything that's happened?

00:43:02,278 --> 00:43:05,315
(sniffling)
All you have to do is...

00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:07,384
walk through the door.

00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:16,726
Come on.

00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,596
(crying)

00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:21,931
It's all right.
