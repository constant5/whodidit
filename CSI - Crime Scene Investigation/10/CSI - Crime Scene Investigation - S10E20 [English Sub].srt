00:00:01,874 --> 00:00:04,076
(jazzy Vegas show music playing)

00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:07,279
(applause)

00:00:10,015 --> 00:00:11,417
MAN:
<i>I'll tell you why.</i>

00:00:11,484 --> 00:00:13,519
<i>It's my mom's fault</i>
<i>I'm still single.</i>

00:00:13,586 --> 00:00:16,088
What do you mean,
it's your mom's fault?

00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:18,557
She hates every
girl I bring home.

00:00:18,624 --> 00:00:19,992
Listen, you little
nuck-nuck,

00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:23,095
some girls you just don't
bring home to Mom.

00:00:23,162 --> 00:00:26,132
For instance, if a girl's
ever told you to hurry up

00:00:26,198 --> 00:00:28,134
before somebody
takes her corner,

00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,771
that's not a girl
you take home to Mom.

00:00:31,837 --> 00:00:33,773
And you say to a girl
you're gonna take her

00:00:33,839 --> 00:00:35,408
to a football game,
and at the halftime,

00:00:35,474 --> 00:00:36,575
the band comes
on the field

00:00:36,642 --> 00:00:39,678
and-and spells out
her phone number.

00:00:39,745 --> 00:00:42,481
That's not a girl
you take home to Mom.

00:00:42,548 --> 00:00:44,483
No, you don't
take her home to Mom.

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,620
Right. Now if
you find a girl

00:00:47,686 --> 00:00:49,488
who thinks
shooting the breeze

00:00:49,555 --> 00:00:51,957
means wearing a mini-
skirt without undies,

00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:55,428
oh-ho, don't take
her home to Mom.

00:00:55,494 --> 00:00:56,762
Take her home to Dad.

00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:01,333
And if her tattoos,
her tattoos are misspelled,

00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,835
man, oh, man,
you don't try to bring

00:01:02,902 --> 00:01:04,370
that... you-you...

00:01:04,437 --> 00:01:06,605
You-you don't try...
You don't-you don't...

00:01:06,672 --> 00:01:08,708
Oh! Am I running this
through the shredder.

00:01:08,774 --> 00:01:09,775
What is... Uh...

00:01:09,842 --> 00:01:12,945
"You don't take her home."

00:01:13,012 --> 00:01:14,113
This is funny stuff, ladies.

00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,482
30 years ago, your parents
were peeing themselves

00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:18,317
in the TV room.

00:01:18,384 --> 00:01:20,119
30 years ago, you were saying
the right lines.

00:01:20,186 --> 00:01:22,321
I'm distracted
by these lovelies.

00:01:22,388 --> 00:01:25,524
They probably all got
boyfriends, husbands.

00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:27,793
And you,

00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,963
you got that beautiful wife,
your Terpsie.

00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,698
I got nobody, Knuckles.

00:01:32,765 --> 00:01:34,366
Never did.

00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:36,535
Nobody loves me.

00:01:36,602 --> 00:01:39,071
<i>I</i> love you.

00:01:40,206 --> 00:01:41,774
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:43,376
Everybody loves Knuckles.

00:01:43,442 --> 00:01:45,211
Nobody loves Nash.

00:01:45,277 --> 00:01:46,545
Ten minutes.

00:01:46,612 --> 00:01:49,982
Ten minutes!

00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:52,551
Ten minutes, girls.

00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:53,886
See you at the party.

00:01:53,953 --> 00:01:55,921
(showgirls conversing
indistinctly)

00:01:55,988 --> 00:01:58,657
Ten minutes, Mr. Nash!

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,428
Mr. Nash?

00:02:03,462 --> 00:02:04,530
It's me-- Bingo.

00:02:04,597 --> 00:02:06,432
Is everything okay?

00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,275
SANDERS:
It was the Rat Pack
at the Sands in '62,

00:02:16,342 --> 00:02:19,378
Elvis at the Hilton in '69,

00:02:19,445 --> 00:02:22,782
and Knuckles &amp; Nash
at the Rampart in '74.

00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,916
This was supposed

00:02:23,983 --> 00:02:25,818
to be their first reunion
in 30 years.

00:02:25,885 --> 00:02:27,720
And I bet you
had a ticket.

00:02:27,787 --> 00:02:29,922
Saturday night, front row.

00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:31,257
(Stokes laughs)

00:02:38,097 --> 00:02:39,465
What's the story, Doc?

00:02:39,532 --> 00:02:41,434
No obvious trauma.

00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,937
Jaw's slack,
dead no more than two hours.

00:02:45,004 --> 00:02:46,372
Could be a natural.

00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,406
Blemishes,

00:02:47,473 --> 00:02:50,976
enlarged blood vessels
on his skin.

00:02:51,043 --> 00:02:53,312
It's consistent with long-term
alcohol abuse.

00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:55,815
Legend is,
Nash was such a boozer,

00:02:55,881 --> 00:02:58,584
PD kept a cell waiting for him
every time they played town.

00:02:58,651 --> 00:02:59,885
What do you think?

00:02:59,952 --> 00:03:01,620
Open bottle of vodka,
used glass.

00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:02,955
One last drink?

00:03:04,323 --> 00:03:06,392
One last laugh.

(siren whooping)

00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:46,817
AKERS: Hey. So, a Sanitation
Department worker

00:03:46,883 --> 00:03:48,485
noticed the tarp
when he was making a pickup.

00:03:48,552 --> 00:03:49,720
Nobody's laid a finger on it.

00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:53,824
Let's take a look.

00:03:59,563 --> 00:04:01,565
Ooh...

00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:02,699
Human Swiss cheese.

00:04:02,766 --> 00:04:04,334
AKERS:
Holy...!

00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:07,037
Man!

00:04:07,104 --> 00:04:09,339
LANGSTON:
Hands blown off,

00:04:09,406 --> 00:04:10,974
feet blown off.

00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,175
With what? Bazooka?

00:04:12,242 --> 00:04:14,578
Well, that might not be
an exaggeration.

00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:18,315
WILLOWS:
If Holey Man was shot here,

00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:21,051
we'd have more evidence of it,
not to mention

00:04:21,118 --> 00:04:22,319
someone in the neighborhood
would've heard.

00:04:22,386 --> 00:04:24,855
We'll canvass the block.

00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:25,923
There's white trace

00:04:25,989 --> 00:04:27,858
on the body as well
as the tarp.

00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:33,330
You usually see

00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:35,599
this level of violence
down around the border.

00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,501
Could be spillover from Mexico.

00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,670
We're definitely in gangland.

00:04:39,736 --> 00:04:41,672
This is how cartels kill people.

00:04:41,738 --> 00:04:44,775
I.D.-less,
no face, no hands.

00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:46,543
I'm assuming no wallet.

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,811
Nothing.

00:04:51,481 --> 00:04:53,283
Gun on him.

00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,484
Gun <i>in</i> him.

00:04:56,853 --> 00:04:58,522
When a man is dead,
a man is dead.

00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,624
Why keep killing him?

00:05:00,691 --> 00:05:02,559
Either you're very angry

00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:04,828
or you're having too much fun
to stop.

00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:28,485
Tox just came in
for Bernie Nash.

00:05:28,552 --> 00:05:30,487
BAC was .11.

00:05:30,554 --> 00:05:33,090
He had a reputation as
a gold-medal drinker.

00:05:33,156 --> 00:05:35,092
How's this for a chaser?

00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:39,396
Henry also found higher than
therapeutic levels of oxycodone.

00:05:39,463 --> 00:05:41,331
Really?

00:05:41,398 --> 00:05:42,866
Well, you know,
if he'd just been drinking,

00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:44,568
I would think
he died of natural causes.

00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,970
I mean, he was an old comic

00:05:47,037 --> 00:05:48,906
facing an audience
after decades.

00:05:48,972 --> 00:05:50,274
You add in
the drugs...

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,308
So he over-medicated?

00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,743
It wouldn't surprise me.

00:05:52,809 --> 00:05:54,678
I, uh, I need to roll him here.

00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:56,914
(Robbins grunts)

00:05:58,882 --> 00:06:01,451
STOKES:
Bruises and abrasions.

00:06:01,518 --> 00:06:03,453
Appear to be perimortem.

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,557
Yeah, alcohol abusers
bruise easily.

00:06:10,627 --> 00:06:14,898
There's some trace
in these scratches.

00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:19,169
Gold flecks.

00:06:19,236 --> 00:06:21,405
He had a whole lot
of party going on.

00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:23,941
Those are <i>love</i> scratches.

00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:26,710
(young woman laughs,
Bernie groans)

00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:30,414
It appears old Bernie
wasn't alone when he died.

00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,490
KNUCKLES:
Well, Bernie had the most
creative comic mind

00:06:40,557 --> 00:06:41,758
in the business.

00:06:41,825 --> 00:06:43,360
Brilliant, really was.

00:06:43,427 --> 00:06:45,429
He was my friend for 40 years,

00:06:45,495 --> 00:06:47,965
partner, brother I never had,
you know?

00:06:48,031 --> 00:06:49,700
I was nothing without him.

00:06:49,766 --> 00:06:52,402
I-I was just this hippie comic

00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:54,805
with a dirty T-shirt
telling bad jokes,

00:06:54,871 --> 00:06:56,807
getting no laughs.

00:06:56,873 --> 00:06:59,610
And all of a sudden,
Bernie sees the act

00:06:59,676 --> 00:07:02,079
and says, "Hey. Hmm?"

00:07:02,145 --> 00:07:04,281
So he gets me a haircut,
tuxedo,

00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:08,552
puts me on his left side,
bang, we're big stars.

00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:10,887
You know the stage
manager-- Bingo?
Uh-huh.

00:07:10,954 --> 00:07:13,357
He said that you rehearsed
up till 4:00 p.m.

00:07:13,423 --> 00:07:14,391
Is that right?

00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,959
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we did.

00:07:16,026 --> 00:07:21,598
Uh, but look, if you haven't
got a pulse by now,

00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:23,567
I'm gonna be doing
a double with Bernie

00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:26,003
over at Forest Lawn,
all right? Huh?

00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:27,905
Uh, did Mr. Nash
appear ill at any time?

00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:30,407
WOMAN:
He was a nervous wreck

00:07:30,474 --> 00:07:32,409
every rehearsal this week.

00:07:32,476 --> 00:07:34,411
Yeah, yeah, well,

00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:35,746
you know,
it takes a whileto get

00:07:35,812 --> 00:07:37,881
your stage legs back
under you after 30 years.

00:07:37,948 --> 00:07:40,350
Oh, sure.
Come on in, Greg.

00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:41,885
This is CSI Sanders.
He may have

00:07:41,952 --> 00:07:43,020
a few questions.
Huh?

00:07:43,086 --> 00:07:44,855
Did you see Mr. Nash
after the rehearsal?

00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,590
No, no, he wanted

00:07:46,657 --> 00:07:49,393
to, uh, take a nap,
so he went back to his room.

00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:52,629
Which is French for
"hoisting a couple."

00:07:52,696 --> 00:07:54,364
(clears throat)
Uh, sweetheart,

00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:56,166
I'll-I'll handle this.

00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:57,434
Right.

00:07:57,501 --> 00:07:59,269
KNUCKLES: A lot of comics
will knock one back

00:07:59,336 --> 00:08:01,471
before the show,
you know, kinda relax 'em.

00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:03,807
SANDERS: Excuse me,
Captain, but

00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:06,977
wasn't it his drinking
that broke up the act?

00:08:07,044 --> 00:08:08,145
Yeah. (chuckles)

00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:09,846
How could you possibly
know that?

00:08:09,913 --> 00:08:12,282
That-that was before
you were even born.

00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:13,417
Hey, look,

00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:15,285
we were a couple
of poor kids

00:08:15,352 --> 00:08:17,087
who made a pile of money,

00:08:17,154 --> 00:08:20,824
but Bernie didn't have
any time to play with it,

00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:23,527
so, huh-huh,
he quits.

00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:25,429
Was it amicable?

00:08:25,495 --> 00:08:26,763
I thought I was through,
you know?

00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,933
As it turned out, it
opened some other doors.

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,101
I did TV shows.

00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:33,170
Two hit TV
shows I had.

00:08:33,237 --> 00:08:34,171
Very successful.

00:08:34,238 --> 00:08:37,574
And I-I did, uh, movies.
Had movies.

00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:40,444
And Mr. Nash?

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,045
He-He played with his money,
yeah.

00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:45,315
Racehorses,
real estate, women.

00:08:45,382 --> 00:08:47,718
Pretty soon,
he's busted again,

00:08:47,784 --> 00:08:49,086
so he needed a comeback.

00:08:49,152 --> 00:08:50,087
He asked me...

00:08:50,153 --> 00:08:51,154
Begged you.

00:08:51,221 --> 00:08:53,056
Begged...

00:08:53,123 --> 00:08:54,458
Begged you.

00:08:54,524 --> 00:08:55,559
And, uh,

00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:57,895
how could I say no?

00:08:57,961 --> 00:09:01,632
We believe that someone
was with him when he died.

00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:03,133
KNUCKLES:
Oh?

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,969
A woman.

00:09:06,036 --> 00:09:08,405
A woman.
Aha, ha, ha...

00:09:08,472 --> 00:09:10,274
Yeah, those-those are good.

00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,542
<i>Cherchez la...</i>

00:09:12,609 --> 00:09:14,511
showgirl--
that's-that's French.

00:09:14,578 --> 00:09:15,679
Do you have a name?

00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:17,981
Did he ever get a name?

00:09:18,048 --> 00:09:21,285
KNUCKLES:
No, no, but...

00:09:21,351 --> 00:09:22,686
good for Bernie.

00:09:22,753 --> 00:09:25,522
Went out with his shorts down.
(chuckles)

00:09:27,925 --> 00:09:31,695
...97, 98,

00:09:31,762 --> 00:09:36,600
99, 100...

00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:38,201
101...

00:09:38,268 --> 00:09:41,438
Over 100 bullet holes,
and still counting.

00:09:41,505 --> 00:09:43,006
I take it that's why

00:09:43,073 --> 00:09:44,408
Catherine kicked me over
to help.

00:09:44,474 --> 00:09:46,710
There are bullet holes
on top of bullet holes.

00:09:46,777 --> 00:09:49,012
There are bullet holes
through bullet holes.

00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:50,781
Plenty of bullets
in his body,

00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,549
and one bullet
in his mouth.

00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:57,054
Fast-track that frag
to Ballistics.

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,596
(squishing)

00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:14,471
Looks like he left us
some kind of I.D.

00:10:36,193 --> 00:10:38,462
(computer trilling, beeping)

00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:47,604
(rapid beeping)

00:10:50,173 --> 00:10:51,675
LANGSTON:
Kurtis Torse.

00:10:51,742 --> 00:10:53,176
Ten Most Wanted list.

00:10:53,243 --> 00:10:54,978
SIDLE:
I know him.

00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:57,281
He blew up an abortion clinic
in Seattle last year.

00:10:57,347 --> 00:10:59,249
This was a dangerous man.

00:10:59,316 --> 00:11:01,685
He's been on the
run for a year.
That's a long time.

00:11:01,752 --> 00:11:03,086
It's not every day

00:11:03,153 --> 00:11:05,355
you get a hit
on a Top-Tener.

00:11:05,422 --> 00:11:07,925
Yes, but who got him?

00:11:17,872 --> 00:11:19,840
(door opening)

00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:21,776
Hey, Doc. I left you
a breakfast burrito

00:11:21,842 --> 00:11:23,511
in the other fridge.

00:11:23,577 --> 00:11:24,578
Thanks.

00:11:24,645 --> 00:11:26,547
So is that another picture

00:11:26,614 --> 00:11:28,683
for your <i>Death-styles</i>
<i>of the Rich and Famous</i> book?

00:11:28,749 --> 00:11:31,118
The death of Bernie Nash

00:11:31,185 --> 00:11:33,888
is a book-worthy mystery
of its own, my boy.

00:11:33,954 --> 00:11:36,524
A locked dressing
room mystery.

00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,727
So you're saying he did not
die of natural causes?

00:11:39,794 --> 00:11:41,128
Nothing natural about it.

00:11:41,195 --> 00:11:42,763
I found a fair amount

00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,198
of fluid in
his pharynx--

00:11:44,265 --> 00:11:46,100
suggested laryngospasm.

00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:47,635
(gurgling)

00:11:47,702 --> 00:11:50,905
<i>His esophageal sphincter</i>
<i>closed off the pathway.</i>

00:11:50,972 --> 00:11:53,641
<i>He couldn't swallow</i>
<i>or breathe.</i>

00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,943
Take a look at the lungs.

00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,145
Pulmonary edema is
the body's response

00:11:58,212 --> 00:12:00,982
to heart failure when
he stopped breathing.

00:12:01,048 --> 00:12:04,251
But there's one more thing--

00:12:04,318 --> 00:12:07,254
I aspirated this fluid
from the sphenoid sinuses.

00:12:07,321 --> 00:12:09,156
They were full of it.

00:12:09,223 --> 00:12:11,826
Pulmonary edema,
laryngospasm,

00:12:11,892 --> 00:12:15,029
his pharynx and sinuses
were filled with fluid?

00:12:15,096 --> 00:12:16,797
Are you trying to tell me
this guy drowned?

00:12:16,864 --> 00:12:18,232
That's exactly
what it looked like.

00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:21,102
At least from
where I'm standing.

00:12:21,168 --> 00:12:24,171
The closest body of water
was a toilet 12 feet away.

00:12:24,238 --> 00:12:26,173
Told you it was
a great mystery.

00:12:28,476 --> 00:12:31,746
WILLOWS:
Mrs. Torse, when was the last
time you saw your husband?

00:12:31,812 --> 00:12:33,648
Does it matter?
He's dead.

00:12:33,714 --> 00:12:36,183
Whoever killed him
did you a favor.

00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,285
We prefer to find
our suspects alive.

00:12:38,352 --> 00:12:41,656
Well, that wasn't gonna happen.

00:12:41,722 --> 00:12:43,958
He's too smart.

00:12:44,025 --> 00:12:45,860
Think about it.

00:12:45,926 --> 00:12:51,065
He got all the way from Seattle
to Las Vegas on foot,

00:12:51,132 --> 00:12:53,134
and no one heard a peep.

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,902
WILLOWS:
<i>Did he ever contact you?</i>

00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:57,204
MRS. TORSE:
<i>Feds had my phones tapped</i>
<i>and two guys on my tail.</i>

00:12:57,271 --> 00:12:58,773
<i>You know he didn't.</i>

00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:01,842
<i>The day the police found out</i>
<i>Kurt did the bombing</i>

00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:05,313
<i>was the last day I saw him.</i>

00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:08,516
He just walked out the front
door and he didn't look back.

00:13:08,582 --> 00:13:11,118
I know you have two children.

00:13:11,185 --> 00:13:13,554
It's hard to not
look back at them.

00:13:13,621 --> 00:13:16,457
No secret visits?

00:13:16,524 --> 00:13:18,693
Kurt's beliefs meant more
to him than his family.

00:13:20,728 --> 00:13:23,831
<i>Kurt always talked about</i>
<i>going off the grid some day.</i>

00:13:23,898 --> 00:13:26,267
<i>How going out in public,</i>

00:13:26,334 --> 00:13:29,837
<i>taking the bus, driving a car</i>

00:13:29,904 --> 00:13:31,172
<i>could get him got.</i>

00:13:31,238 --> 00:13:33,007
WILLOWS:
<i>Any idea who got him?</i>

00:13:33,074 --> 00:13:34,709
How do I know you cops didn't?

00:13:34,775 --> 00:13:36,077
How do I know you didn't?

00:13:36,143 --> 00:13:39,246
27 people died in that clinic.

00:13:39,313 --> 00:13:40,781
They all had families.

00:13:40,848 --> 00:13:42,283
They all wanted Kurt dead.

00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,785
They want me dead.

00:13:44,852 --> 00:13:47,421
So why don't you start
harassing them?

00:13:47,488 --> 00:13:48,856
Why don't you start
giving me names?

00:13:48,923 --> 00:13:50,024
Got no names.

00:13:50,091 --> 00:13:51,859
Sorry.

00:13:51,926 --> 00:13:53,527
I just...

00:13:53,594 --> 00:13:56,597
I'd just catch them
following me around.

00:13:56,664 --> 00:13:59,667
They even called the house.

00:13:59,734 --> 00:14:01,502
I take phone numbers, too.

00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:05,106
I don't call people
who are trying to kill me.

00:14:05,172 --> 00:14:07,441
Well, once you give me
your phone records,

00:14:07,508 --> 00:14:09,143
I can do that for you.

00:14:20,755 --> 00:14:23,024
LANGSTON:
Porcupine man.

00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,493
It's like he was
stuck on a spit

00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,361
and put in front
of a firing squad.

00:14:27,428 --> 00:14:30,731
C.O.D. was GSWs

00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:32,366
to the everything.

00:14:32,433 --> 00:14:34,502
Robbins found these in
the body at autopsy.

00:14:34,568 --> 00:14:36,037
.50 calibers,

00:14:36,103 --> 00:14:37,938
.30-06's, nine millimeters.

00:14:38,005 --> 00:14:40,274
Lucky for us he left us an eye.

00:14:40,341 --> 00:14:42,810
Vitreous potassium puts

00:14:42,877 --> 00:14:45,379
T.O.D. at one to four hours
before you found him.

00:14:45,446 --> 00:14:50,384
All right, that's between
midnight and 3:00 a.m.

00:14:50,451 --> 00:14:52,820
David counted 127 bullet holes--

00:14:52,887 --> 00:14:55,256
37 of which were blackened.

00:14:55,323 --> 00:14:57,258
You know, at first
I thought that was GSR

00:14:57,325 --> 00:15:00,995
from close shots, but histo
revealed that they were singed.

00:15:01,062 --> 00:15:02,663
Tracers or incendiary rounds

00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,665
could cause this kind
of burning.

00:15:04,732 --> 00:15:07,234
When I was a kid,
my dad and his army buddies

00:15:07,301 --> 00:15:10,237
would get drunk and fire tracer
rounds at night on the base,

00:15:10,304 --> 00:15:11,939
tell me they
were fireworks.

00:15:12,006 --> 00:15:13,641
And they are a kind
of firework.

00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,477
<i>Tracers are modified</i>
<i>with a pyrotechnic charge</i>

00:15:16,544 --> 00:15:18,946
<i>in the base. thereby allowing</i>
<i>the machine gun shooter</i>

00:15:19,013 --> 00:15:20,748
<i>to correct his aim</i>

00:15:20,815 --> 00:15:22,116
vis-à-vis the target.

00:15:22,183 --> 00:15:24,185
But incendiaries and tracers

00:15:24,251 --> 00:15:26,253
are designed for use
on the battlefield.

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,656
Fully automatic firearms
and surplus ammo

00:15:28,723 --> 00:15:30,791
are pretty widely available
in Nevada.

00:15:30,858 --> 00:15:32,660
They're illegally sold
to recreational shooters.

00:15:32,727 --> 00:15:36,130
For target practice.

00:15:36,197 --> 00:15:38,833
He certainly looks like
a human target.

00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:42,637
SANDERS:
It's hard to get a hair in your
throat without intimate contact.

00:15:42,703 --> 00:15:44,905
But I guess
you're never too old.

00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:46,540
Especially with
the blue pill.

00:15:46,607 --> 00:15:48,643
Heck, I know guys my age
who are using it.

00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:50,578
Guys who, you know,
need the boost.

00:15:50,645 --> 00:15:51,946
Other guys.

00:15:52,013 --> 00:15:54,181
Take a look.

00:15:55,383 --> 00:15:57,018
The pigment of most hair is

00:15:57,084 --> 00:16:00,321
concentrated on the outer
edges of the cuticle.

00:16:00,388 --> 00:16:04,025
Only red hair has a
central concentration
of pigment like that.

00:16:04,091 --> 00:16:07,795
So, <i>cherchez la</i>
redheaded showgirl.

00:16:11,032 --> 00:16:14,935
I really appreciate you
volunteering to do this.

00:16:15,002 --> 00:16:17,905
Yeah, the only other thing
we had to do today was
file for unemployment.

00:16:17,972 --> 00:16:19,173
Well, I just need

00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,976
a few hair samples
from each of you.

00:16:22,043 --> 00:16:25,379
Well, the drapes are hanging
but the carpet's Brazilian.

00:16:25,446 --> 00:16:26,614
(nervous chuckle)

00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:27,815
Uh...

00:16:27,882 --> 00:16:31,252
a few from your head
should do it.

00:16:33,487 --> 00:16:36,490
So did you see Mr. Nash
after rehearsal?

00:16:36,557 --> 00:16:38,326
We hightailed it out of there

00:16:38,392 --> 00:16:40,761
before he and Knuckles
got offstage.

00:16:40,828 --> 00:16:43,698
Showgirls-- we're moving targets
to Bernie Nash.

00:16:43,764 --> 00:16:45,499
What about Knuckles?

00:16:45,566 --> 00:16:48,436
Oh, he'll corner you, too,
if he gets the chance.

00:16:48,502 --> 00:16:49,837
Bettina darling,

00:16:49,904 --> 00:16:50,838
Well, looking
mighty fine.

00:16:50,905 --> 00:16:51,939
Say, how'd you like to play

00:16:52,006 --> 00:16:53,407
a little King Kong?

00:16:53,474 --> 00:16:55,209
You know, I'll be
the gorilla,

00:16:55,276 --> 00:16:56,877
you be the Empire
State Building.

00:16:56,944 --> 00:16:57,945
Knuckles!

00:16:58,012 --> 00:17:00,181
Whoa. Cheese it, the wife.

00:17:00,247 --> 00:17:02,450
What are you doing
without your pants?

00:17:02,516 --> 00:17:04,552
I, mm, uh... Oh!
(clears throat)

00:17:04,618 --> 00:17:07,021
Uh, well, actually,

00:17:07,088 --> 00:17:09,256
I was doing pretty good
till you showed up.

00:17:09,323 --> 00:17:12,159
BETTINA:
<i>All Knuckles forces</i>
<i>on you is jokes.</i>

00:17:12,226 --> 00:17:15,663
Until his wife
yanks the leash.

00:17:21,435 --> 00:17:24,038
DAWSON:
So those bullet frags
from Torse's mouth

00:17:24,105 --> 00:17:26,741
came from a lead-
free frangible,

00:17:26,807 --> 00:17:28,376
composed of
sintered copper,

00:17:28,442 --> 00:17:30,611
meant to disintegrate
on impact,

00:17:30,678 --> 00:17:34,081
<i>which is why frangibles</i>
<i>are used in shooting ranges.</i>

00:17:34,148 --> 00:17:37,418
Maybe Kurtis Torse was killed
at a range.

00:17:37,485 --> 00:17:39,253
Shot with multiple calibers...

00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,988
means lots of different guns.

00:17:41,055 --> 00:17:43,958
And Vegas has the least
restrictive gun laws
in the country.

00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:47,728
I mean, anyone with a valid I.D.
can shoot a machine gun

00:17:47,795 --> 00:17:49,163
in an indoor range.

00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,399
I'll have Brass pass
his photo around.

00:17:51,465 --> 00:17:52,733
Wait, hang on.

00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,635
I can save him
some shoe leather.

00:17:54,702 --> 00:17:56,437
Come here.

00:17:56,504 --> 00:17:59,307
So your brand of frangible
is Crate City Arsenal.

00:17:59,373 --> 00:18:01,809
Now, unless the killer
ordered them online,

00:18:01,876 --> 00:18:06,247
there's only one shooting range
in town that has those.

00:18:06,314 --> 00:18:08,582
And I'm pretty certain
you've heard of it.

00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:11,786
I have only been
to PD's shooting range.

00:18:11,852 --> 00:18:14,221
The tourists in town
are ditching Manilow
to shoot at this place.

00:18:14,288 --> 00:18:15,423
The ads are everywhere.

00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:17,525
Oh, come on.

00:18:17,591 --> 00:18:19,026
Now, you had to
have seen this.

00:18:23,931 --> 00:18:26,067
Hey, lady, grab
a Blast Away coupon.

00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:27,468
WOMAN (over bullhorn):
Come on in, folks!

00:18:27,535 --> 00:18:30,371
Come on in and experience
the thrill of freedom!

00:18:30,438 --> 00:18:32,740
Exercise your
Second Amendment right

00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:35,076
and experience what
real freedom feels like.

00:18:35,142 --> 00:18:36,978
Come on in, folks.
Come right now.

00:18:37,044 --> 00:18:39,680
And ladies,
first 50 rounds are free.

00:18:44,618 --> 00:18:46,620
(clearing throat)

00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:50,324
Biz license, F.F.L.,

00:18:50,391 --> 00:18:52,526
proof of secure gun
storage, Class-3 license.

00:18:52,593 --> 00:18:54,028
This is not an
enforcement check.

00:18:54,095 --> 00:18:56,664
Do you recognize him?

00:18:56,731 --> 00:18:58,833
A thousand people come
through here every day.

00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:00,835
Yes, but this man
was murdered.

00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:02,069
Uh...

00:19:02,136 --> 00:19:03,371
(nervous chuckle)

00:19:05,973 --> 00:19:08,309
I didn't make
eight mill last year

00:19:08,376 --> 00:19:09,377
because I kill people.

00:19:09,443 --> 00:19:11,679
Do you see those big-ass dudes?

00:19:11,746 --> 00:19:13,014
Anyone tries
anything,

00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,883
one of them
takes care of it.

00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,852
We found a Crate City bullet

00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:18,886
where his two front teeth
used to be.

00:19:18,953 --> 00:19:20,421
You are the
only place

00:19:20,488 --> 00:19:21,722
in town that sells those.

00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:22,757
I don't sell bullets.

00:19:22,823 --> 00:19:24,091
Ammo's included
with the rentals.

00:19:24,158 --> 00:19:25,693
Nothing comes in
or out of this place

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,827
without me knowing.

00:19:26,894 --> 00:19:28,162
We'd like to take a look

00:19:28,229 --> 00:19:29,430
at your surveillance video.

00:19:29,497 --> 00:19:30,598
We'd also like
to take a look around.

00:19:30,665 --> 00:19:32,466
Fine.

00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:34,368
What are you looking for?

00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:35,870
Blood.

00:19:35,936 --> 00:19:38,105
(gunfire blasting)

00:19:45,513 --> 00:19:47,815
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Attention shooters, stop firing.

00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:50,484
Make your guns safe,
step back from the line.

00:19:51,652 --> 00:19:54,221
(repeating announcement
in foreign language)

00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:35,062
(sighs)

00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:36,731
This place hasn't been cleaned.

00:20:36,797 --> 00:20:38,899
There's at least a week's worth
of debris here.

00:20:38,966 --> 00:20:40,901
I'm not seeing a stitch
of blood.

00:20:40,968 --> 00:20:43,904
Torse wasn't shot here.

00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:50,793
WILLOWS: Mrs. Torse's
phone records show

00:20:51,028 --> 00:20:54,531
that you had called her
25 times in January.

00:20:54,598 --> 00:20:57,334
She changed her number
in March,

00:20:57,401 --> 00:21:00,971
following which, you phoned her
another 30 times.

00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,476
Her husband killed my mom
and my dad and my baby sister.

00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:06,877
Anyone I ever cared about.

00:21:06,944 --> 00:21:09,313
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:11,782
You know,
my mom had preeclampsia.

00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:13,517
She, uh, had to get
the procedure

00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:15,252
or she was going to die.

00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:18,255
We found an AK
in your apartment.

00:21:18,322 --> 00:21:23,193
You've also been to
the Blast Away Gun
Alley a dozen times

00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,294
in the last month.

00:21:24,361 --> 00:21:25,562
What were you doing there,
practicing?

00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:27,030
You think I did something

00:21:27,097 --> 00:21:29,066
to that scumbag's wife,
you're wrong.

00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:30,667
No, I think you did something
to the scumbag.

00:21:30,734 --> 00:21:32,102
He was murdered.

00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:35,205
He was shot so many times
you could see through him.

00:21:35,272 --> 00:21:36,373
Yes!

00:21:37,207 --> 00:21:38,776
(whoops)

00:21:38,842 --> 00:21:41,378
(laughing)

00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:45,048
(laughing)

00:21:45,115 --> 00:21:47,751
I didn't kill him,
but I would've.

00:21:49,286 --> 00:21:53,023
I would've taken the needle
to taste that sweet revenge.

00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,459
I mean,
murder is wrong,

00:21:55,526 --> 00:21:56,627
but killing your enemies,

00:21:56,693 --> 00:21:57,795
that's all through
the Old Testament.

00:21:57,861 --> 00:22:00,864
That's pretty much
the same reason

00:22:00,931 --> 00:22:02,499
that Torse bombed that clinic.

00:22:02,566 --> 00:22:04,635
I didn't cast the first stone.

00:22:04,701 --> 00:22:08,305
I'm gonna need your prints,
your DNA,

00:22:08,372 --> 00:22:09,573
and those boots.

00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,175
You got it. They're all yours.

00:22:11,241 --> 00:22:14,611
And, miss, thank you for giving
me the best news of my life.

00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:26,323
HODGES:
All the hairs from the showgirls
were dyed,

00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,259
no pigment concentration.

00:22:29,326 --> 00:22:31,428
And I always thought that
those girls were all natural.

00:22:32,729 --> 00:22:34,264
However, the hair

00:22:34,331 --> 00:22:36,767
that was found
in Bernie Nash's throat

00:22:36,834 --> 00:22:38,102
is from a natural redhead.

00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:40,737
So, it wasn't one of the
showgirls who was with Nash.

00:22:40,804 --> 00:22:43,073
What about

00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,175
the trace in the scratches
on his back?

00:22:45,242 --> 00:22:46,677
Ah, believe it or not,

00:22:46,744 --> 00:22:48,378
there's gold in them
thar scratches.

00:22:49,646 --> 00:22:51,181
No, really, it's actual gold.

00:22:51,248 --> 00:22:54,184
Along with traces
of camphor, ethyl acetate,

00:22:54,251 --> 00:22:56,253
and tosylamide-
formaldehyde resin.

00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,256
All common ingredients
in fingernail polish.

00:22:59,323 --> 00:23:01,458
We're not looking
for a showgirl.

00:23:04,795 --> 00:23:06,930
We're looking for a gold digger.

00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:11,935
I was just trying
to protect my marriage.

00:23:12,002 --> 00:23:16,940
Believe it or not,
I really do love my Knuckles.

00:23:17,007 --> 00:23:19,410
My little hamster.

00:23:19,476 --> 00:23:21,512
Then how do you explain
the traces

00:23:21,578 --> 00:23:24,114
of your fingernail polish
on Bernie Nash's back?

00:23:24,181 --> 00:23:25,149
Huh?

00:23:25,215 --> 00:23:26,784
Remember we found you
trying to remove it

00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,319
when we questioned you?

00:23:29,386 --> 00:23:30,554
(sighs)

00:23:30,621 --> 00:23:34,425
Bernie made a pass at
me the day we met,

00:23:34,491 --> 00:23:36,493
right in front
of Knuckles.

00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,929
And all these
years since,

00:23:38,996 --> 00:23:42,499
every time we saw him,
he was always grabbing

00:23:42,566 --> 00:23:44,735
and squeezing

00:23:44,802 --> 00:23:48,238
and whispering
dirty talk.

00:23:48,305 --> 00:23:51,809
And always, I told
him, "Get lost."

00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:57,448
And then one day he happened
to catch me in a...

00:23:57,514 --> 00:24:00,017
compromising position.

00:24:00,084 --> 00:24:03,320
How'd you get
the funny name?

00:24:03,387 --> 00:24:05,622
By doing this.

00:24:07,057 --> 00:24:08,859
Bingo! (chuckles)

00:24:10,994 --> 00:24:13,330
(moaning)

00:24:13,397 --> 00:24:15,599
Anybody here
got a cough drop?

00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:19,870
Um, do you have
a cough drop?

00:24:19,937 --> 00:24:24,374
Bernie said he would tell
Knuckles unless...

00:24:24,441 --> 00:24:27,244
So, anyway,
after rehearsal,

00:24:27,311 --> 00:24:29,213
I went to his
dressing room and...

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,447
Mm, yeah.

00:24:30,514 --> 00:24:34,418
But Bernie
couldn't do zilch.

00:24:34,485 --> 00:24:35,652
(both laugh)

00:24:35,719 --> 00:24:37,888
Come on!
(grunts)

00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:43,794
Well, you gave it
the 120-proof try.

00:24:44,728 --> 00:24:45,963
Bernie?

00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:48,665
You need a doctor?

00:24:48,732 --> 00:24:51,635
I need a stiff drink.

00:24:51,702 --> 00:24:52,870
Vodka rocks.

00:24:52,936 --> 00:24:56,673
You need a stiff something,
that's for sure.

00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,010
I gave him his
drink, I left,

00:25:00,077 --> 00:25:01,211
and then he died.

00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:03,814
I guess I was
just too much

00:25:03,881 --> 00:25:05,983
for his old heart to handle.

00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:08,986
(both laugh)

00:25:09,052 --> 00:25:14,057
But that-that's not breaking
any laws, is it?

00:25:14,124 --> 00:25:15,626
Well, doping his drink

00:25:15,692 --> 00:25:18,695
with enough oxycodone
to take out Rhode Island is.

00:25:18,762 --> 00:25:21,665
What?

00:25:21,732 --> 00:25:23,667
No, I didn't, I didn't.

00:25:23,734 --> 00:25:26,069
I don't even have any oxy.

00:25:26,136 --> 00:25:27,237
Oh, come on.

00:25:27,304 --> 00:25:29,673
And believe me,
I could use it.

00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,242
Dancing for 20 years,
I got gravel for cartilage

00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:34,511
and back pain like you
wouldn't believe.

00:25:34,578 --> 00:25:36,880
What I do believe...

00:25:36,947 --> 00:25:39,716
is that you could never let Nash
tell your little hamster

00:25:39,783 --> 00:25:41,785
about what was going on
between you and Bingo.

00:25:41,852 --> 00:25:45,789
It wasn't Nash's heart
that made him a dud Casanova,

00:25:45,856 --> 00:25:49,626
it was the fact
that he was loaded up on dope.

00:25:49,693 --> 00:25:50,928
That's what did it.

00:25:56,967 --> 00:25:59,636
That's ridiculous.

00:25:59,703 --> 00:26:04,108
The last thing you could get
Bernie to drink was water.

00:26:06,176 --> 00:26:09,146
Look, I was there
five minutes, tops.

00:26:09,213 --> 00:26:11,749
And when I left,
he was alive.

00:26:11,815 --> 00:26:15,419
Well, now he's dead.

00:26:15,486 --> 00:26:18,489
And you're not going
anywhere.

00:26:31,368 --> 00:26:33,237
Oh, uh, no-no, no-no.

00:26:33,303 --> 00:26:34,905
The straw
and razor blade

00:26:34,972 --> 00:26:37,307
are for an experiment
that I'm working on.

00:26:37,374 --> 00:26:38,442
And the white stuff?

00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:40,244
Uh, the white stuff.

00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:44,581
Yes, that's magnesite,
aka magnesium carbonate.

00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:47,651
It's the white residue

00:26:47,718 --> 00:26:49,319
that was found
on the tarp

00:26:49,386 --> 00:26:50,921
that your victim was
wrapped up in.

00:26:50,988 --> 00:26:52,656
It was also found on
Daniel Peidre's boots.

00:26:52,723 --> 00:26:54,658
Where does one find a lot
of magnesite around here?

00:26:54,725 --> 00:26:56,026
You want to guess where

00:26:56,093 --> 00:26:57,795
the largest magnesite mine
in the U.S. is?

00:26:57,861 --> 00:26:58,796
Not really.

00:26:58,862 --> 00:27:00,164
I'll tell you anyway.

00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:03,867
It's in the lovely town
of Gabbs, Nevada.

00:27:03,934 --> 00:27:05,102
About two 250 miles

00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:06,103
outside of Vegas.

00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:08,505
You know, my mother
took me there

00:27:08,572 --> 00:27:09,840
for my 15th birthday.

00:27:09,907 --> 00:27:12,409
She's a bit
of a rock hound.

00:27:12,476 --> 00:27:14,912
Every store in town sells
magnesite souvenirs.

00:27:14,978 --> 00:27:18,215
There's clocks,
key chains, pens...

00:27:18,282 --> 00:27:23,587
Maybe the killer killed
Torse in Gabbs.

00:27:23,654 --> 00:27:26,023
All right, T.O.D.
was between 12:00 a.m.

00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,591
and 3:00 a.m.

00:27:27,658 --> 00:27:30,060
Which means the killer would've
had to have shot Torse

00:27:30,127 --> 00:27:32,096
127 times in Gabbs,

00:27:32,162 --> 00:27:35,632
then drove 250 miles
to Vegas to dump the body.

00:27:35,699 --> 00:27:37,835
All under four hours.

00:27:37,901 --> 00:27:39,603
I don't buy that.

00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:45,042
But I bet there's
plenty of magnesite

00:27:45,109 --> 00:27:47,644
washing down from that mine.

00:27:51,348 --> 00:27:53,984
Koral, Nevada.

00:27:54,051 --> 00:27:55,986
Just 50 miles outside of Vegas.

00:27:56,053 --> 00:27:57,121
More like it.

00:27:57,187 --> 00:27:59,189
Mm-hmm.

00:28:03,727 --> 00:28:04,962
MAN:
<i>Light 'em up!</i>

00:29:05,522 --> 00:29:06,490
Excuse me!

00:29:06,557 --> 00:29:08,358
Hey, y'all lookin' for passes?!

00:29:08,425 --> 00:29:12,029
LVPD usually
shoots here for free!

00:29:12,096 --> 00:29:13,464
We're not here to shoot!

00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,767
We need everybody
to stop shooting-- now!

00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:18,735
Okay.

00:29:18,802 --> 00:29:21,405
(whistles)

00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:23,907
(air horn blows,
gunfire stops)

00:29:23,974 --> 00:29:25,776
MAN (over P.A.):
Okay, folks, sorry about that.

00:29:25,843 --> 00:29:27,511
MAN:
Hey, what's going on?

00:29:27,578 --> 00:29:28,912
(over P.A.):
Uh, local authorities have got

00:29:28,979 --> 00:29:30,514
a little something to do here
for a few minutes.

00:29:30,581 --> 00:29:31,448
Why don't you visit
the tables...

00:29:31,515 --> 00:29:33,250
Now first off,
let me just say

00:29:33,317 --> 00:29:35,586
I'm a huge supporter
of law enforcement.

00:29:35,652 --> 00:29:37,321
I respect the badge.

00:29:37,387 --> 00:29:40,124
But this here,
it's not a firing range.

00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,592
It's a shootout.

00:29:41,658 --> 00:29:43,660
I don't need a permit.

00:29:43,727 --> 00:29:44,995
I own the land.

00:29:45,062 --> 00:29:46,764
All right. I see
you're shooting an M2.

00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:51,201
And I noticed
a grenade launcher
on the way in,

00:29:51,268 --> 00:29:53,370
a hydraulic cannon as well
as a flamethrower.

00:29:53,437 --> 00:29:54,938
Yes, sir, pretty cool.

00:29:55,005 --> 00:29:56,940
All registered and legal.
Doesn't mean you

00:29:57,007 --> 00:29:58,776
should be shooting
them for fun, does it?

00:29:58,842 --> 00:30:00,811
Sure. Why not?

00:30:00,878 --> 00:30:03,947
This here-- it's a festival,
celebrating gun ownership.

00:30:04,014 --> 00:30:06,650
A place where
law-abiding Americans

00:30:06,717 --> 00:30:08,051
can dust off weapons

00:30:08,118 --> 00:30:10,888
they normally couldn't use
anywhere else.

00:30:10,954 --> 00:30:13,190
Want to try the ol' Ma Deuce?

00:30:13,257 --> 00:30:14,224
She's a lot of fun.

00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:15,292
I'm sure she is.

00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,994
Do you recognize
this man?

00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,496
Negative.

00:30:19,563 --> 00:30:21,632
We think he might have been
killed on your property.

00:30:21,698 --> 00:30:26,870
Ma'am, I've been doing this
for a lot of years.

00:30:26,937 --> 00:30:28,472
Never had any accidents.

00:30:28,539 --> 00:30:30,374
We didn't say
it was an accident.

00:30:30,441 --> 00:30:32,276
What about him?

00:30:32,342 --> 00:30:33,710
Have you ever seen him before?

00:30:33,777 --> 00:30:35,412
Yeah.

00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:38,015
Yeah, yeah, he was

00:30:38,082 --> 00:30:39,783
shooting down here
the other night.

00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:42,186
Well, as a big supporter
of law enforcement,

00:30:42,252 --> 00:30:44,321
would you mind if we
took a look around?

00:30:44,388 --> 00:30:46,957
Not at all.

00:31:10,614 --> 00:31:13,951
(whirrs, beeps)

00:31:33,303 --> 00:31:35,439
What if Terpsie Pratt
is telling the truth,

00:31:35,506 --> 00:31:37,508
and she didn't
kill Nash?

00:31:37,574 --> 00:31:39,877
She's not a redhead.
It's possible.

00:31:39,943 --> 00:31:41,445
So, somebody must have been

00:31:41,512 --> 00:31:43,847
in the dressing room
after she left.

00:31:43,914 --> 00:31:46,116
Yeah, but the hair I found
didn't come from

00:31:46,183 --> 00:31:48,252
any of the people
that we know were backstage.

00:31:48,318 --> 00:31:50,721
And we still don't know where
the oxycodone came from.

00:31:50,788 --> 00:31:53,357
Water, water everywhere,
including Bernie Nash's lungs.

00:31:53,424 --> 00:31:54,858
Good. Salt water?

00:31:54,925 --> 00:31:56,226
Tap water? Glacial melt? What?

00:31:56,293 --> 00:31:58,862
Fresh water,
indeterminate source.

00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:01,632
But it did contain minute
particles of ferric oxide.

00:32:01,698 --> 00:32:04,902
Iron rust. That usually comes
from old pipes.

00:32:04,968 --> 00:32:07,171
That's why nearly all water
lines are copper now.

00:32:07,237 --> 00:32:08,439
We can probably
rule out

00:32:08,505 --> 00:32:10,140
Terpsie's bottled water.

00:32:10,207 --> 00:32:11,375
And the samples that
you collected

00:32:11,442 --> 00:32:12,443
from the dressing room sink,

00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:14,745
toilet and shower
had no iron particles.

00:32:14,812 --> 00:32:17,681
So the water Nash drowned in
came from somewhere else.

00:32:17,748 --> 00:32:18,682
And it doesn't add up.

00:32:18,749 --> 00:32:20,451
We gotta go back
to the crime scene.

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,788
Dressing rooms were
completely renovated
a year ago.

00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:25,823
Including the plumbing?

00:32:25,889 --> 00:32:26,890
Yeah, all new.

00:32:26,957 --> 00:32:28,425
Believe me,
no expense spared.

00:32:28,492 --> 00:32:30,094
All right, thanks, Bingo.

00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,209
Lines are all copper.

00:32:45,275 --> 00:32:47,745
Water did not come from here.

00:32:47,811 --> 00:32:50,180
(man and woman arguing
in distance)

00:32:50,247 --> 00:32:51,882
MAN:
Get out of here!

00:32:51,949 --> 00:32:53,417
Come on.
WOMAN:
Give it to me!

00:32:53,484 --> 00:32:55,586
Hey! Come here!
Give me that!

00:32:55,652 --> 00:32:57,387
Let go!

00:32:57,454 --> 00:32:59,256
Are you crazy?
Let go!

00:32:59,323 --> 00:33:00,324
Let go!

00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,526
STOKES: Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:33:02,593 --> 00:33:03,527
What's going on here?

00:33:03,594 --> 00:33:04,528
He took my bag.

00:33:04,595 --> 00:33:05,829
Hey, hey, hey!
Give me my bag!

00:33:05,896 --> 00:33:07,664
It's my bag.
Give it back!

00:33:07,731 --> 00:33:09,833
All right, enough, enough!

00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,869
You're under arrest
for assault.

00:33:11,935 --> 00:33:13,003
Which gives me the right

00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,004
to search your bag.

00:33:14,071 --> 00:33:15,305
Cuff him.

00:33:15,372 --> 00:33:16,306
Aw, come on.

00:33:16,373 --> 00:33:17,341
There's nothing
in there.

00:33:17,408 --> 00:33:18,609
(handcuffs clicking)

00:33:18,675 --> 00:33:21,378
What's this?

00:33:21,445 --> 00:33:22,613
(pills rattle)

00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:25,716
Looks like oxycodone to me.

00:33:25,783 --> 00:33:27,050
Where did that come from?

00:33:27,117 --> 00:33:28,352
That's illegal
possession,

00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:30,287
sale of a Schedule II
controlled substance

00:33:30,354 --> 00:33:31,288
and homicide.

00:33:31,355 --> 00:33:32,689
Looks like we got
ourselves a Bingo.

00:33:32,756 --> 00:33:33,924
Get him out of here.

00:34:04,663 --> 00:34:06,665
Oh, I got something
over here.

00:34:13,038 --> 00:34:15,274
(flies buzzing)

00:34:15,341 --> 00:34:16,976
Whew!

00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:20,146
Well, Torse was missing
both of his feet.

00:34:20,212 --> 00:34:22,214
Directionality of the
blood is heading this way.

00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,630
I got a finger.

00:34:41,534 --> 00:34:43,035
(camera clicks twice)

00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:51,644
(Langston sighs)

00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,013
Looks like this is
where it started.

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,883
(flies buzzing)

00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,425
MAN:
That's what I'm talkin' about!

00:35:06,492 --> 00:35:07,726
MAN 2:
Here we go, boys!

00:35:07,793 --> 00:35:09,161
(men shouting,
whooping in distance)

00:35:09,228 --> 00:35:11,130
(gunfire blasting)

00:35:11,197 --> 00:35:12,264
(grunting)

00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:15,334
(groans)

00:35:22,141 --> 00:35:25,311
SIDLE: So you said that Daniel
Peidre was at your shootout.

00:35:25,377 --> 00:35:26,579
Yeah.
What was he shooting?

00:35:26,645 --> 00:35:27,913
Same thing
we were all shooting.

00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,315
The mountain.

00:35:29,381 --> 00:35:31,183
Look, the kid didn't do
this by himself, all right?

00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,518
You want to play
dumb with us,

00:35:32,585 --> 00:35:33,853
we'll just charge
you for murder, too.

00:35:33,919 --> 00:35:35,521
Look, I didn't kill anybody.

00:35:35,588 --> 00:35:37,022
We found his
body wrapped in

00:35:37,089 --> 00:35:39,925
one of your blue tarps
off an alley on 28th Street,

00:35:39,992 --> 00:35:41,193
where it was dumped.

00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,828
It's your land,
it's your shootout,

00:35:42,895 --> 00:35:43,996
it's your responsibility.

00:35:44,063 --> 00:35:45,197
So what happened?

00:35:45,264 --> 00:35:48,033
<i>Daniel catches himself</i>
<i>a famous fugitive,</i>

00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,335
<i>he brings him down here,</i>

00:35:49,401 --> 00:35:51,737
<i>you guys decide</i>
<i>to have a whole lot of fun,</i>

00:35:51,804 --> 00:35:52,972
<i>use him for target practice...</i>

00:35:53,038 --> 00:35:55,541
No, no, no, no.
No, that's not what happened.

00:35:55,608 --> 00:35:57,009
Then what did happen?

00:35:57,076 --> 00:35:59,645
Because that is the story
that we're gonna give the D.A.

00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,716
He was already dead
when I found him.

00:36:03,783 --> 00:36:07,686
<i>We sweep the range before</i>
<i>and after every night shoot,</i>

00:36:07,753 --> 00:36:09,455
<i>make sure it's clear</i>
<i>of animals.</i>

00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:14,493
<i>Never expected to see</i>
<i>a body out there.</i>

00:36:23,135 --> 00:36:27,006
My family's owned this land
for over a hundred years.

00:36:27,072 --> 00:36:29,575
I figured you guys find
a dead body out here,

00:36:29,642 --> 00:36:31,076
you'd probably take it from me.

00:36:31,143 --> 00:36:33,579
Most people take their bodies
from Vegas out to the desert,

00:36:33,646 --> 00:36:34,947
not the other way around.

00:36:35,014 --> 00:36:38,884
Well, I'm just not real
experienced on killing people.

00:36:38,951 --> 00:36:42,288
<i>Look, I was just trying to get</i>
<i>the scent away from my land.</i>

00:36:44,323 --> 00:36:46,292
<i>All right,</i>
<i>we dropped him in Northtown</i>

00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:49,762
<i>thinking you guys would think</i>
<i>it was some sort of gang thing.</i>

00:36:51,697 --> 00:36:55,000
I'm telling you,
we sweep this range

00:36:55,067 --> 00:36:56,235
at last light.

00:36:56,302 --> 00:36:58,504
He had to have snuck in
after that to camp out.

00:37:17,356 --> 00:37:19,425
<i>It's so dark out there.</i>

00:37:19,492 --> 00:37:20,726
<i>We didn't know about him.</i>

00:37:20,793 --> 00:37:22,628
<i>He sure as hell</i>
<i>didn't know about us.</i>

00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:26,432
Not till we started shooting.

00:37:26,499 --> 00:37:29,602
So, you're saying
that this was an accident?

00:37:29,668 --> 00:37:33,506
Ma'am, I'm telling you that
everybody on that firing line

00:37:33,572 --> 00:37:35,708
probably put at least
one bullet in him.

00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:38,544
Including me.

00:37:38,611 --> 00:37:41,514
That kid-- he didn't have
anything to do with it.

00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,782
Well, the dead guy,

00:37:42,848 --> 00:37:46,619
Kurtis Torse, he blew up
an abortion clinic.

00:37:46,685 --> 00:37:48,220
He killed 27 people.

00:37:48,287 --> 00:37:51,323
If you had just
called the cops,

00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,025
you'd be a hero
right now.

00:37:53,092 --> 00:37:55,161
LANGSTON:
Instead, you tried
to cover it up.

00:37:55,227 --> 00:37:57,863
Which makes you a criminal, too.

00:38:03,903 --> 00:38:05,271
Bingo's the oxy connection.

00:38:05,337 --> 00:38:06,739
He's involved
with Terpsie Pratt,

00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:08,741
which gave her access
to the drugs.

00:38:08,808 --> 00:38:12,745
And Nash's death would have
kept their affair secret.

00:38:12,812 --> 00:38:15,247
But how did
they drown him?

00:38:15,314 --> 00:38:18,184
(ice clattering)

00:38:22,755 --> 00:38:24,557
Old model.

00:38:29,295 --> 00:38:32,064
You thinking what
I'm thinking?

00:38:32,131 --> 00:38:35,034
I was, but it's
another copper line.

00:38:35,101 --> 00:38:37,436
Let's get this panel off.

00:38:49,915 --> 00:38:53,452
The line's got a leak--
check it out.

00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:56,922
And it's dripping onto
that rusty panel.

00:39:04,263 --> 00:39:06,966
It's dripping into the ice bin.

00:39:07,032 --> 00:39:10,903
Nash drowned in ice cubes?

00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:13,105
Well, the vodka and the oxy

00:39:13,172 --> 00:39:14,740
would have induced
respiratory depression.

00:39:14,807 --> 00:39:17,042
<i>Blood flow to the brain</i>
<i>would've been reduced.</i>

00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:18,511
<i>He was probably</i>
<i>unable to realize</i>

00:39:18,577 --> 00:39:20,780
<i>what was happening to him,</i>
<i>much less how to stop it.</i>

00:39:20,846 --> 00:39:23,282
No prints.

00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:25,918
Weapon just melts away.

00:39:25,985 --> 00:39:28,921
Looks like natural causes.

00:39:28,988 --> 00:39:31,223
It's the perfect murder.

00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,826
Yeah, but where'd
the red hair come from?

00:39:33,893 --> 00:39:36,228
It's not the showgirl's--
hers was dyed.

00:39:36,295 --> 00:39:37,496
And Terpsie's a brunette.

00:39:39,532 --> 00:39:41,967
Knuckles wears a toupee.

00:39:42,034 --> 00:39:43,202
So what?

00:39:43,269 --> 00:39:44,270
It's brown.

00:39:44,336 --> 00:39:46,906
Well, having
dabbled in the art

00:39:46,972 --> 00:39:49,341
of discreet hair
coloration myself

00:39:49,408 --> 00:39:52,645
in my younger, more
experimental days,

00:39:52,711 --> 00:39:56,382
I know a thing or two about
the calibration of highlights

00:39:56,449 --> 00:40:00,653
and lowlights required to
obtain certain effects.

00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:04,857
To wit, human hair both absorbs
and reflects light.

00:40:04,924 --> 00:40:09,395
<i>So, a brown toupee could also</i>
<i>contain lighter shades,</i>

00:40:09,462 --> 00:40:12,998
<i>such as light brown,</i>
<i>blonde or even red.</i>

00:40:13,065 --> 00:40:15,768
I guarantee you,
we are going to find

00:40:15,835 --> 00:40:18,871
red hairs in Knuckles' rug.

00:40:21,707 --> 00:40:25,144
Should've taken
that toupee off a long time ago.

00:40:25,211 --> 00:40:26,145
It's been molting for years.

00:40:26,212 --> 00:40:28,047
(chuckles)

00:40:28,114 --> 00:40:29,849
No, I-I-I did.

00:40:29,915 --> 00:40:31,117
I killed Bernie.

00:40:31,183 --> 00:40:33,085
Well, why?

00:40:33,152 --> 00:40:35,221
Was it jealousy because
they were having an affair?

00:40:35,287 --> 00:40:37,623
Oh, no; no, no.

00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:40,493
No, if a light in Vegas
went out every time

00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:42,495
Terpsie banged a guy...
(chuckles)

00:40:42,561 --> 00:40:45,331
you'd have to be a bat
to find your way home at night.

00:40:45,397 --> 00:40:46,966
That wasn't it.

00:40:47,032 --> 00:40:51,437
You see... what we do
out on that stage,

00:40:51,504 --> 00:40:53,105
it's kind of like
life and death.

00:40:53,172 --> 00:40:56,108
I mean, you do a good show
and you come off and you go,

00:40:56,175 --> 00:40:57,176
"Boy, I killed 'em."

00:40:57,243 --> 00:40:58,344
(chuckles)

00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,513
But, uh, you don't
get any laughs,

00:41:00,579 --> 00:41:04,350
oh, boy, you say,
"Whew, I died."

00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:06,786
Yeah.

00:41:06,852 --> 00:41:08,754
Yeah, and that's not
just an expression.

00:41:08,821 --> 00:41:11,056
You know, when Bernie and I
were rehearsing

00:41:11,123 --> 00:41:15,060
last week, um... well,

00:41:15,127 --> 00:41:18,564
he couldn't remember any of
the new material, you know.

00:41:18,631 --> 00:41:22,501
He couldn't even remember
the old material, so, just...

00:41:22,568 --> 00:41:26,505
Drive me kind of crazy,
but he lost his funny.

00:41:26,572 --> 00:41:30,443
And when a comic
loses his funny...

00:41:30,509 --> 00:41:31,610
that's the end.

00:41:31,677 --> 00:41:33,245
(slurring):
Cancel? Are you nuts!

00:41:33,312 --> 00:41:34,580
Give back a
million bucks?

00:41:34,647 --> 00:41:36,348
You don't want
to open, fine.

00:41:36,415 --> 00:41:38,951
I done a single before,
and I'll do it again.

00:41:41,987 --> 00:41:43,489
KNUCKLES:
<i>I couldn't let him go out</i>

00:41:43,556 --> 00:41:46,025
<i>in front of that audience</i>
<i>on opening night.</i>

00:41:46,092 --> 00:41:48,861
I figure I...

00:41:48,928 --> 00:41:51,330
I just killed him
before they did.

00:41:53,432 --> 00:41:56,302
And I did it because...

00:41:56,368 --> 00:41:58,304
I loved him.

00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:00,573
And he'd have done
the same for me.

00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:02,274
Where did you get the OxyContin?

00:42:02,341 --> 00:42:04,043
Swiped it from Terpsie.

00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,744
You know, she's got
a little trouble

00:42:05,811 --> 00:42:06,779
with the pills, you know.

00:42:06,846 --> 00:42:08,214
(chuckles)

00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,649
Yeah, she tries to hide that
stuff from me, but I find it.

00:42:10,716 --> 00:42:11,917
You know,
it's a little game we play.

00:42:11,984 --> 00:42:14,120
And how'd you come up with
the ice cube gag?

00:42:14,186 --> 00:42:17,123
Oh, y-yeah... Oh, that was
a good one. Yeah, yeah.

00:42:17,189 --> 00:42:19,859
See, I did a show with Angela
Lansbury one time, you know.

00:42:19,925 --> 00:42:22,128
And, uh, Angie says to me--
I called her Angie--

00:42:22,194 --> 00:42:24,430
she says to me,

00:42:24,497 --> 00:42:27,633
"That's the perfect murder."

00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,969
And I say, "Well, it would
have been perfect,

00:42:30,035 --> 00:42:32,805
if you hadn't decided
to come to town."

00:42:32,872 --> 00:42:35,007
(laughs)

00:42:35,074 --> 00:42:37,343
Eh, got a pretty big laugh.

00:42:39,345 --> 00:42:41,147
Yeah.

00:42:41,213 --> 00:42:44,483
Nuh, maybe I lost
my funny, too, huh?

00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,318
But I'll tell you
something.

00:42:46,385 --> 00:42:48,654
It was beautiful
while we were there.

00:42:48,721 --> 00:42:49,822
Yes, sirree.

00:42:49,889 --> 00:42:53,626
And we were both there,
right on top, you know.

00:42:53,692 --> 00:42:55,694
Vegas was Mount Olympus.

00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:00,132
And we were gods.
