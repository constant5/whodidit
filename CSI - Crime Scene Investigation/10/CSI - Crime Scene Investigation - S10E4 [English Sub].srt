00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:56,111
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:00:56,177 --> 00:00:58,747
MAN:
I was the driver on patrol.

00:00:58,813 --> 00:01:02,517
Heard gunfire,
called it in, responded.

00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:05,720
Saw the suspect with a gun
firing in a southwest direction.

00:01:05,787 --> 00:01:08,256
Told my partner
to call for backup.

00:01:08,323 --> 00:01:10,859
Fearing for someone's life,
I exited the vehicle

00:01:10,926 --> 00:01:12,928
and engaged the suspect.

00:01:12,994 --> 00:01:14,996
I fired three rounds.

00:01:15,063 --> 00:01:16,831
Suspect went down.

00:01:16,898 --> 00:01:18,934
I approached,
kicked the gun away,

00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,268
handcuffed him.

00:01:20,335 --> 00:01:21,670
Okay.

00:01:21,736 --> 00:01:24,339
(chuckles wryly):
25 years on the job, Jim.

00:01:24,406 --> 00:01:27,175
First time I ever had
to fire my weapon.

00:01:27,242 --> 00:01:28,944
What was your partner's name?

00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,812
Donna Grayson.

00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,948
First week on patrol.

00:01:33,014 --> 00:01:33,982
Officer Grayson, we're ready

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:35,650
to take you
downtown now.

00:01:35,717 --> 00:01:37,552
We're gonna need your
statement, too, Danny.

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,621
Yeah, I know the drill.
Okay.

00:01:39,688 --> 00:01:42,190
Hey.
We've been getting
way too much business

00:01:42,257 --> 00:01:43,625
out of this
neighborhood, Jim.

00:01:43,692 --> 00:01:46,628
Well, if the gangs in L.A.
would stay in L.A.,

00:01:46,695 --> 00:01:48,697
life in the ghetto
would be beautiful again.

00:01:48,763 --> 00:01:50,799
What does it
look like, David?

00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:52,834
We got three GSWs:

00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:54,536
one to the left kidney area;

00:01:54,603 --> 00:01:56,104
one to the left thigh;

00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:58,106
and one to the
upper torso.

00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,675
LANGSTON:
At least one of them

00:02:00,742 --> 00:02:02,077
was a through-and-through.

00:02:05,146 --> 00:02:08,016
A nine-millimeter hollow-point.

00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:10,352
This looks like our duty issue.

00:02:10,418 --> 00:02:12,487
Smith &amp; Wesson Model 60.

00:02:12,554 --> 00:02:14,756
.38 Special.

00:02:14,823 --> 00:02:16,858
Suspect fired four rounds.

00:02:16,925 --> 00:02:21,563
Well, that's consistent
with Officer Finn's statement.

00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,064
Hey, brother!
Let me talk to you!

00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:25,333
That's right.
I'm talking to you.

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,869
Damn cop shot him
after he was down.

00:02:27,936 --> 00:02:29,504
(crowd clamoring)

00:02:29,571 --> 00:02:31,373
Plain murder.

00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,574
Murder!

00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:33,875
She's speaking the truth!

00:02:33,942 --> 00:02:35,277
It was murder!

00:02:35,343 --> 00:02:37,279
Murder!
Would they be crying "murder"

00:02:37,345 --> 00:02:39,047
if he was a white guy?

00:02:41,249 --> 00:02:43,418
It's not about this guy.

00:02:43,485 --> 00:02:45,954
It's never about one guy.

00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:48,123
We'll be taking all their
statements. Let's keep going.

00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,625
David, would you go ahead
and roll him, please?

00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:53,295
(crowd clamoring)

00:03:04,573 --> 00:03:08,476
We have another
nine-mil hollow-point.

00:03:08,543 --> 00:03:10,011
Well, there are a lot of ways

00:03:10,078 --> 00:03:11,713
a bullet could end up
under his body.

00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,616
I can only think of two:
shot from a distance

00:03:14,683 --> 00:03:17,886
through-and-through,
bullet got caught
in his clothing,

00:03:17,953 --> 00:03:19,588
fell out when
he went down;

00:03:19,654 --> 00:03:20,956
or...

00:03:21,022 --> 00:03:23,391
the suspect was shot
after he was down,

00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,227
like the young lady said.

00:03:25,293 --> 00:03:26,595
Coup de grâce.

00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:28,663
Sounds like you already
made up your mind.

00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,967
You already made up yours?

00:03:32,033 --> 00:03:34,269
Ray.

00:03:38,306 --> 00:03:39,975
Jim?
Yeah?

00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,410
This man is a cop.

00:03:42,477 --> 00:03:43,511
Oh, no.

00:03:43,578 --> 00:03:45,180
LANGSTON:
Sergeant Scott Johnson.

00:03:45,247 --> 00:03:47,215
Lives in Seven Hills.
(groans)

00:03:47,282 --> 00:03:49,851
What are you doing
down here, my man?

00:03:49,918 --> 00:03:51,820
BRASS:
I'll find out.

00:03:51,887 --> 00:03:54,923
First I have to notify Ecklie.

00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,591
Conrad, Jim Brass.

00:03:56,658 --> 00:03:58,159
(Brass continues indistinctly)

00:03:58,226 --> 00:04:00,662
Eyes are gonna be
on every move we make.

00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:03,031
They already are.

00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:06,535
Tired of this!
Shot him in the back!

<i>Hey, you know as well as I do--</i>
<i>if there's one gun,</i>

00:05:03,126 --> 00:05:05,228
there's two; if there's
two guys, there's three.

00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:07,500
It's how I was trained;
it's how I train the rookies.

00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:09,201
You don't have
to defend your actions.

00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,703
I'm just here to document them

00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,538
for the record.
(door opens)

00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:15,541
CSI Willows has
entered the room.

00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:18,177
She is here
to collect and document

00:05:18,244 --> 00:05:19,779
your service weapon.

00:05:19,845 --> 00:05:23,182
WILLOWS:
Actually, I'd like to ask
a few questions first.

00:05:23,249 --> 00:05:25,584
This is a sketch of the...

00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:28,854
900 block of Adams Street,
where the shooting took place.

00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:31,390
Officer Finn, could you indicate
the position of the suspect

00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:32,558
and where you were

00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,027
when you fired?
Suspect was...

00:05:35,094 --> 00:05:37,196
here.

00:05:37,263 --> 00:05:39,532
For the record,
Officer Finn has indicated

00:05:39,598 --> 00:05:41,233
that the suspect was
in the parking lot

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,769
of White House Burgers,
south of the building.

00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:45,271
I parked my vehicle here.

00:05:45,338 --> 00:05:47,373
I fired behind
the driver's door.

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,709
Also in the parking lot,
north of the suspect.

00:05:49,775 --> 00:05:51,677
And you never fired
from any other position?

00:05:51,744 --> 00:05:53,312
No, I fired three.

00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:55,748
From behind my door.

00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:59,352
(two gunshots)
WILLOWS:
<i>When did the suspect go down?</i>

00:05:59,418 --> 00:06:02,288
FINN:
<i>On the third shot.</i>

00:06:02,355 --> 00:06:06,125
WILLOWS:
<i>At what point</i>
<i>did you approach the suspect?</i>

00:06:06,192 --> 00:06:08,694
FINN:
<i>When I felt the suspect</i>
<i>was no longer a threat.</i>

00:06:08,761 --> 00:06:09,762
<i>When he was down.</i>

00:06:12,932 --> 00:06:15,234
FINN:
Somebody saying
something different?

00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:19,605
BRASS:
Well, preliminary
eyewitness reports suggest...

00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:23,109
that the suspect was shot
in the back after he was down.

00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:26,078
So far the physical evidence
doesn't disprove it.

00:06:26,145 --> 00:06:28,047
Well, it didn't happen.

00:06:28,114 --> 00:06:29,915
Ask my partner.

00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:34,053
You gonna tell me
what's going on here?

00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,888
Did you recognize him?

00:06:35,955 --> 00:06:37,289
No.

00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,591
Did you I.D. yourself to him?

00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:40,660
I don't know. Maybe.

00:06:40,726 --> 00:06:42,628
Did you give him a chance
to I.D. himself to you?

00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:43,663
Hell, no. Why would I?

00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:45,231
Because he was a cop.

00:06:45,298 --> 00:06:48,701
Sergeant
Scott Johnson.

00:06:54,674 --> 00:06:56,142
That's it.

00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,810
I'm not saying another word

00:06:57,877 --> 00:06:59,812
until my union attorney
gets here.

00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,781
STOKES:
<i>If Finn fired three shots</i>

00:07:01,847 --> 00:07:03,649
from behind his door
in that direction,

00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:07,186
cartridge cases would have
ejected right... and rear.

00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:10,122
They should be
around here somewhere.

00:07:13,192 --> 00:07:15,328
LANGSTON:
I think I got one.

00:07:27,707 --> 00:07:30,843
Make that two.

00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,681
One to go.

00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:39,352
WOMAN:
<i>He shot out of there</i>
<i>like a bolt of lightning.</i>

00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,053
SANDERS:
<i>So you saw him</i>
<i>leave the restaurant?</i>

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,555
I'm saying, where's
that other guy,

00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:45,024
the one I was talking to
in the parking lot?

00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:46,459
You know who I mean.

00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:48,094
Well, you got me.

00:07:51,564 --> 00:07:55,134
(sighs) Did you, uh,
see anybody on the street?

00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:56,135
Anything unusual?

00:07:56,202 --> 00:07:57,670
Not till all that
gunfire started,

00:07:57,737 --> 00:07:59,672
and that's not
all that unusual.

00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:01,440
Okay.

00:08:01,507 --> 00:08:03,809
What happened
when you heard the shots?

00:08:03,876 --> 00:08:05,645
I grabbed my baby,
and I hit the ground.

00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:06,879
Your baby?

00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:08,247
My boy, Avery.

00:08:08,314 --> 00:08:10,216
Six years old.

00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,418
Bring him with me to work.

00:08:12,485 --> 00:08:14,654
Sitters cost too much.

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,222
Could you see who was shooting?

00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,423
I saw the floor.

00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,924
And when did you go outside?

00:08:18,991 --> 00:08:20,026
When it got quiet.

00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:22,295
Can you show me
where you were standing?

00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:24,597
Right here.

00:08:24,664 --> 00:08:26,666
Right outside the door.

00:08:26,732 --> 00:08:27,833
What did you see?

00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,835
I saw the brother murdered.

00:08:29,902 --> 00:08:33,673
Here. The cop was standing
over him, and he shot him.

00:08:33,739 --> 00:08:35,508
But you just said
that you waited

00:08:35,574 --> 00:08:38,744
until the shooting stopped
before you went outside.

00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:41,714
I know what I saw
and what I heard.

00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:44,417
There was a whole bunch
of guns going off.

00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:45,885
Then it got quiet.

00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:47,586
Then one last shot,

00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:50,823
and that cop was standing
over that poor man.

00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,792
I saw a murder.

00:08:56,195 --> 00:08:58,331
(gunshot)

00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,902
Well, if that's what happened,

00:09:02,969 --> 00:09:05,571
Officer Finn's gun would have
been pointed at the ground.

00:09:05,638 --> 00:09:09,375
That cartridge case...

00:09:09,442 --> 00:09:11,444
ejected.

00:09:20,219 --> 00:09:22,188
(whistles)

00:09:27,627 --> 00:09:29,762
Nine-millimeter
cartridge case.

00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:32,531
Consistent with
witness statements.

00:09:32,598 --> 00:09:35,835
And inconsistent with
the officer's statement.

00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,305
Sara, glad to see you back.

00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:40,406
Ecklie.

00:09:40,473 --> 00:09:42,241
How was your
week off in Paris?

00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:43,609
Dr. Grissom sends
his regards.

00:09:43,676 --> 00:09:45,811
Were you able to
make notification?
Well, Johnson's

00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:47,213
only next-of-kin is his father.

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,748
Looks like he's out of town.

00:09:48,814 --> 00:09:51,083
Any word on what Johnson
was doing down there?

00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,485
Well, according
to Johnson's captain,

00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:55,154
he was off duty; Adams Street
isn't in his district;

00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:57,590
he wasn't working undercover;
<i>and</i> he had no informants.

00:09:57,657 --> 00:09:59,825
So no official reason
to be there.

00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:03,429
Which is why you are here.

00:10:03,496 --> 00:10:05,665
Maybe Sergeant Johnson

00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:08,901
was just looking
for a good burger.

00:10:08,968 --> 00:10:10,236
I doubt it.

00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,138
Take a look at his body fat.

00:10:12,204 --> 00:10:14,106
Not the usual
yellow-orange color.

00:10:14,173 --> 00:10:16,942
It's white.
He was a vegetarian.

00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:19,178
So what was he doing
in a burger joint?

00:10:19,245 --> 00:10:21,847
Do you have the third bullet?

00:10:25,384 --> 00:10:26,852
Nine-mil.

00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:29,622
Lodged in his left kidney,
not immediately fatal.

00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:33,459
Same as the one
shot through his left thigh.

00:10:33,526 --> 00:10:35,494
This one's your COD.

00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:37,163
Back-to-front.

00:10:37,229 --> 00:10:38,431
Penetrated the
interventricular septum

00:10:38,497 --> 00:10:39,999
near the base of the heart.

00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:42,768
<i>That's the area concerned</i>
<i>with its electrical conduction.</i>

00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:45,104
(heart beating,
electrical buzzing)

00:10:45,171 --> 00:10:47,340
Kind of like flipping
the main breaker.

00:10:47,406 --> 00:10:49,175
Heart would have
stopped immediately.

00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:50,443
So it must have been
the final shot.

00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:53,879
Does the trajectory tell you
if he was standing or prone?

00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:56,015
That is the question
of the night,

00:10:56,082 --> 00:10:57,883
and I can't give you an answer.

00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,585
You know,

00:10:59,652 --> 00:11:01,654
in ancient times,
a coup de grâce

00:11:01,721 --> 00:11:03,522
was considered an act of mercy--

00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:05,124
a quick blow
to end the suffering

00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:07,660
of a comrade wounded in battle.

00:11:07,727 --> 00:11:11,931
Whatever this was,
it was no act of mercy.

00:11:21,741 --> 00:11:23,743
♪ ♪

00:11:41,427 --> 00:11:43,429
♪ ♪

00:11:49,268 --> 00:11:51,103
How's the House of Meat?

00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:55,341
Sergeant Johnson ordered
two burgers, two drinks,
and a salad.

00:11:55,408 --> 00:11:57,610
Burgers were not for him.
He was a vegetarian.

00:11:57,677 --> 00:12:01,213
According to the witnesses,
he entered alone.

00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,149
So he must have been
meeting someone.

00:12:03,215 --> 00:12:04,750
Okay. Who?

00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:08,020
And why haven't
they come forward?

00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:10,690
Officer Grayson,
could you see

00:12:10,756 --> 00:12:12,758
who Sergeant Johnson
was shooting at?

00:12:14,627 --> 00:12:17,630
I don't think so.

00:12:17,697 --> 00:12:19,031
It was all so fast.

00:12:19,098 --> 00:12:21,167
I should have seen more.

00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:23,970
I didn't.

00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:26,572
Can we do this a little later?

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,174
A officer lost his life
last night.

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,242
We owe it to him
to get past ourselves

00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:31,644
and do what we
have to do.

00:12:31,711 --> 00:12:33,779
If you want to pound nails
in your head, do it tomorrow.

00:12:33,846 --> 00:12:35,715
Now, show me your position.

00:12:35,781 --> 00:12:39,952
Um, I was right there,

00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:41,821
calling for backup.

00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,322
And while you were
on the radio,

00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:44,824
could you see
Sergeant Johnson?

00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,158
No.

00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:47,693
Could you see your partner?

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,328
Yes.

00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:51,430
FINN:
Grayson, get the hell down.

00:12:51,497 --> 00:12:53,466
Call for backup now.

00:12:53,532 --> 00:12:55,434
Control, this is 3 David 34.

00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:58,037
We have a 444 in progress,
900 block of Adams.

00:12:58,104 --> 00:12:59,739
(two gunshots)

00:12:59,805 --> 00:13:02,708
Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.

00:13:02,775 --> 00:13:05,277
Requesting backup
and paramedics.

00:13:05,344 --> 00:13:06,646
(gunshot)

00:13:06,712 --> 00:13:08,881
DISPATCH:
3 David 3-4, copy that.
Will advise.

00:13:08,948 --> 00:13:11,050
All units, vicinity
of 900 block of Adams,

00:13:11,117 --> 00:13:14,487
be advised we have a 444 in
progress. Officer involved.

00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:16,989
So you didn't actually see

00:13:17,056 --> 00:13:19,125
Officer Finn
fire the third shot?

00:13:19,191 --> 00:13:20,860
I heard it.

00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:23,596
It was close.

00:13:23,663 --> 00:13:25,898
But by the time
that I looked up...

00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:30,736
Where was Officer Finn
when you looked up?

00:13:30,803 --> 00:13:34,540
Over the body.

00:13:39,045 --> 00:13:40,313
Do you have the dispatch calls

00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:42,214
from Officer Finn's
patrol car yet?

00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,084
Is there a problem?

00:13:45,151 --> 00:13:46,452
Deputy?

00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,920
No, ma'am.

00:13:47,987 --> 00:13:50,489
But Officer Finn's mic was stuck
in the open position.

00:13:50,556 --> 00:13:52,358
Happens all the time.
Might be helpful.

00:13:52,425 --> 00:13:55,695
Let's hear it.

00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:57,096
FINN:
Grayson, get the hell down!

00:13:57,163 --> 00:13:58,331
Call for backup now!

00:13:58,397 --> 00:14:01,367
GRAYSON:
Control, this is 3 David 34.

00:14:01,434 --> 00:14:03,102
We have a 444 in progress.

00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:04,870
(two gunshots)

00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:06,643
FINN:
I'm taking him down.

00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,179
Black son of a bitch.

00:14:09,246 --> 00:14:11,248
(gunshot)

00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:23,270
Jim, we need to
talk about the...

00:14:23,337 --> 00:14:25,339
Jim!

00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,379
I put my credibility
on the line for you.

00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:35,515
CSI said excessive force.
I said, "No way."

00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:37,217
That's right.
Oh, really?

00:14:37,284 --> 00:14:38,418
(audio device beeps on)

00:14:38,485 --> 00:14:39,686
FINN (on recording):
I'm taking him down.

00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,588
Black son of a bitch.

00:14:41,655 --> 00:14:43,123
(shot fires, device beeps off)

00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,825
Look, I don't remember
saying that.

00:14:44,892 --> 00:14:46,159
I'm advising you not to speak.

00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:47,594
Not until we hear
the complete recording

00:14:47,661 --> 00:14:48,896
and check
the witness statements.

00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:50,364
What, you think
I'm racist?

00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,732
ATTORNEY: Again, officer,
I'm telling you...

00:14:51,798 --> 00:14:53,834
I don't remember. If
I said he was black,

00:14:53,901 --> 00:14:55,569
I was describing
the suspect.

00:14:55,636 --> 00:14:58,071
I was so focused on what
the gun was doing, I...

00:14:58,138 --> 00:14:59,306
Did you see his face?

00:14:59,373 --> 00:15:00,674
No, it was dark out.

00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:02,843
Are you telling me you didn't
recognize Scott Johnson?

00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,245
He was a trainee.
He rode with you.

00:15:05,312 --> 00:15:06,647
He was your damn partner
for four months.

00:15:06,713 --> 00:15:08,382
You spent eight hours a day
in the car together.

00:15:08,448 --> 00:15:10,284
You saw more of him
than you did of your wife.

00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,818
This was over five years ago.

00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:14,288
So, you're telling me that
you didn't recognize the guy

00:15:14,354 --> 00:15:15,889
who put a formal complaint
in your file

00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,558
for racial discrimination?

00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:19,092
Let me read
this to you.

00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:22,563
"Frequent and excessive use
of racial epithets,

00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:23,931
including the 'N' word."

00:15:23,997 --> 00:15:28,068
First of all, no,
I didn't recognize Johnson.

00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:31,939
And second, yeah, sure, I use
street talk with the trainees.

00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:33,807
Come on, you know
that doesn't fly anymore.

00:15:33,874 --> 00:15:34,875
But believe me,

00:15:34,942 --> 00:15:36,643
whatever they get from me
is nothing

00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,378
compared to what they're going
to get from the real gorillas

00:15:38,445 --> 00:15:40,514
in the jungle.
That's a poor choice of words.

00:15:40,581 --> 00:15:42,549
I am training them
for the real world.

00:15:42,616 --> 00:15:46,486
And of the dozens and dozens
of people that I have trained--

00:15:46,553 --> 00:15:49,122
and that is every color
of the rainbow, pal--

00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:51,558
that hard-ass was the only one
who ever complained.

00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,627
The only one.

00:15:53,694 --> 00:15:57,297
He's the racist, not me.

00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,668
WILLOWS:
<i>Ready, set, go.</i>

00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,608
Four seconds.
(groans)

00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:08,809
Could have run it in two.

00:16:08,876 --> 00:16:10,744
Except we're timing
a 53-year-old guy

00:16:10,811 --> 00:16:12,713
who's packing
about 30 pounds of gear.

00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:15,549
So, the distance from Finn's car
to Johnson's body was 40 feet?

00:16:15,616 --> 00:16:18,919
And according
to the dispatch recording,

00:16:18,986 --> 00:16:21,989
there was 5.4 seconds

00:16:22,055 --> 00:16:24,424
that elapsed between
the second and third shots.

00:16:24,491 --> 00:16:26,793
SIDLE:
<i>Greg just proved</i>
<i>that that's time enough</i>

00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,496
<i>for Finn to have delivered</i>
<i>the final shot over the body.</i>

00:16:29,563 --> 00:16:31,131
(gunshot)

00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,101
Brass found out Finn put in for
a promotion about a year ago.

00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:35,435
It was denied.

00:16:35,502 --> 00:16:37,237
A couple of weeks later,

00:16:37,304 --> 00:16:40,874
Finn saw Johnson at another
officer's retirement party,

00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:42,242
took a swing at him.

00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:44,611
Finn probably thought
he deserved a desk job

00:16:44,678 --> 00:16:45,779
and a bigger pension

00:16:45,846 --> 00:16:47,347
and he blamed Johnson
for not getting it.

00:16:47,414 --> 00:16:50,150
Would Finn have delivered
that coup de grâce,

00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,486
if that guy hadn't been Johnson?

00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,021
But it was, and when
Finn recognized him,

00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:56,023
his resentment
probably took over.

00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:57,724
Racially motivated, you think?

00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,027
Well, obviously, race is
a hot-button issue for the guy.

00:17:00,093 --> 00:17:01,795
When I heard
the dispatch recording,

00:17:01,862 --> 00:17:04,398
I hated what I heard.
I thought, "The guy's a racist."

00:17:04,464 --> 00:17:07,034
But it may not be that simple.

00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,869
I mean, it was
a stress situation.

00:17:08,936 --> 00:17:12,406
And people say things
they would never, ever say

00:17:12,472 --> 00:17:14,474
in a normal setting.

00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,876
Don't we?

00:17:15,943 --> 00:17:17,844
(liquid pouring)

00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,380
LANGSTON:
You know, there was a study
done back in Michigan

00:17:20,447 --> 00:17:22,049
about a year or so ago.

00:17:22,115 --> 00:17:25,285
It, uh, examined
an officer's response

00:17:25,352 --> 00:17:27,588
to situations
involving deadly force

00:17:27,654 --> 00:17:29,022
and whether race is a factor.

00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:33,560
It found that an officer has
less than a third of a second

00:17:33,627 --> 00:17:35,162
to decide
whether to use his gun.

00:17:35,229 --> 00:17:36,363
That's not much time.

00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,632
It's enough for
an instinctive response.

00:17:38,699 --> 00:17:40,634
Yes, but the study showed,
overwhelmingly,

00:17:40,701 --> 00:17:43,437
that the most important factor
in an officer's response

00:17:43,503 --> 00:17:46,039
is the suspect's actions,
not race.

00:17:47,374 --> 00:17:49,710
I'm not talking
about racial profiling.

00:17:49,776 --> 00:17:51,845
That's a whole other
box of crayons.

00:17:51,912 --> 00:17:54,514
I'm talking about
that third of a second

00:17:54,581 --> 00:17:56,750
when a threat jumps out at you.

00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:58,819
(bangs loudly)

00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:03,891
Look...

00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:07,527
when I had a gun
pulled on me,

00:18:07,594 --> 00:18:11,098
I didn't check for skin color
before I pulled the trigger.

00:18:11,164 --> 00:18:13,033
(phone beeps)

00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,701
Finn's motives are not
what we're after.

00:18:14,768 --> 00:18:17,070
Just the evidence that's going
to tell us about his actions.

00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,406
WILLOWS:
We got a 420

00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,376
at an abandoned school
on Madison, north of Fifth.

00:18:23,744 --> 00:18:25,879
I'll take it.
Okay.

00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,817
And life goes on.

00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,090
If I need to call you,
I'm going to. That's cool?

00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,692
Thanks.

00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,828
Moreno.
Sara.

00:18:41,895 --> 00:18:43,630
Skater found the body.

00:18:43,697 --> 00:18:45,632
It looks like a
gang execution.

00:18:45,699 --> 00:18:47,968
The victim's just a kid.

00:18:50,103 --> 00:18:51,905
(groans)

00:18:51,972 --> 00:18:53,507
Body's in full rigor.

00:18:53,574 --> 00:18:55,242
TOD was about 16 hours ago.

00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:57,544
10:00 last night.

00:18:57,611 --> 00:18:58,812
It was a busy hour
in the neighborhood.

00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:01,949
This was why my parents
moved from L.A. to Vegas.

00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,918
So I wouldn't end up like that.

00:19:04,985 --> 00:19:06,920
GSW to the neck.

00:19:06,987 --> 00:19:09,289
It's a through-and-through.

00:19:15,229 --> 00:19:16,263
Got a bullet here.

00:19:18,966 --> 00:19:21,768
Nine-mil.

00:19:21,835 --> 00:19:23,270
Everybody
loves their nines, huh?

00:19:23,337 --> 00:19:25,772
Good guys, bad guys. My mom.

00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:28,175
I don't see any cartridge
casings.

00:19:28,242 --> 00:19:30,677
Homeboys are catching finally on
and policing their brass.

00:19:32,246 --> 00:19:33,647
He's missing a finger.

00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,484
When you get him on the table,
look in his rectum.

00:19:38,652 --> 00:19:39,953
You'll find his finger there.

00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,690
So that's what gangs are doing
to snitches these days?

00:19:43,757 --> 00:19:45,592
How do you know he's a snitch?

00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:47,561
He got shot through the throat.

00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:53,033
Trajectory was upwards,
front to back.

00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,335
David, can I see the entry?
Yeah.

00:20:00,674 --> 00:20:03,477
(sobbing):
No, please.

00:20:03,544 --> 00:20:05,879
No! No!

00:20:05,946 --> 00:20:08,515
Please! I'll stop!
I'll stop! Please, no!

00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,983
No! No!

00:20:12,219 --> 00:20:13,720
Hmm.

00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,861
Supplying or buying?

00:20:25,365 --> 00:20:27,000
Got sneaker prints in blood.

00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:29,870
Ball to toe.

00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:34,174
They were running.

00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:36,243
The tread detail is still sharp.

00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,178
Sneakers were fairly new.

00:20:38,245 --> 00:20:42,049
Probably just lifted them
at the mall.

00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:46,653
Blood drops traveling
in the same direction.

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,356
Your suspect was wounded.

00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,289
You know, I can't help
but wonder

00:21:22,356 --> 00:21:23,957
how Officer Finn
just happened to roll up

00:21:24,024 --> 00:21:25,425
on the very guy
he had a beef with.

00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,927
Yeah, who just happened to be
in the middle of the hood,

00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,663
miles from home and
shooting at something.

00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,267
Presenting Finn with the perfect
opportunity to exact revenge.

00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,336
What do you think? You think
it could have been a setup?

00:21:36,403 --> 00:21:38,939
I don't know. I mean, he
called in "shots fired"

00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,208
before he could even see
that it was Johnson.

00:21:41,275 --> 00:21:43,243
But if he planned it,
he knew Johnson was there.

00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,879
And his unwitting partner
would give him credibility.

00:21:47,714 --> 00:21:50,984
All right, so, what puts
Johnson on Adams Street

00:21:51,051 --> 00:21:52,920
in the first place?

00:21:52,986 --> 00:21:55,489
Well, his last call
was to someone

00:21:55,556 --> 00:21:58,859
named "Anthony" at 9:59 pm.

00:21:58,926 --> 00:22:02,129
Dispatch logged
"shots fired" at 10:07 p.m.

00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,965
Looks like Johnson and this guy
called each other

00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,967
several times
over the last couple days.

00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,969
All right, so maybe
that's who he was meeting.

00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,138
Could run the number
on an AG warrant.

00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,773
Or we could call him.

00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,641

00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,443

00:22:39,866 --> 00:22:41,335
(phone beeps)

00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,703
Hello?

00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:44,037
STOKES:
Sara?

00:22:44,104 --> 00:22:45,973
This is Nick.

00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,207
Whose phone is this?

00:22:47,274 --> 00:22:48,208
My John Doe's--

00:22:48,275 --> 00:22:49,176
the dead kid.

00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:53,313
His name's Anthony.

00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,166
SIDLE:
<i>Victim's name</i>
<i>was Anthony Lopez.</i>

00:22:59,233 --> 00:23:01,235
He lived with his mom
in an apartment on Garfield.

00:23:01,302 --> 00:23:02,370
She I.D.'d the body.

00:23:02,436 --> 00:23:04,405
She said he wasn't
involved with gangs.

00:23:04,472 --> 00:23:05,673
Don't they all?

00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,575
What did she say about
the drugs he was carrying?

00:23:07,642 --> 00:23:10,378
She said he never used,
and his tox came back clean.

00:23:10,444 --> 00:23:12,013
Did the mother know
Sergeant Johnson?

00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:14,115
No. And Johnson
wasn't working gangs.

00:23:14,181 --> 00:23:16,317
And Lopez did not
have a record.

00:23:16,384 --> 00:23:19,287
Sorry, Mom, this has gangs
written all over it.

00:23:19,353 --> 00:23:21,489
PD has a trial
on some new gang software.

00:23:21,556 --> 00:23:23,291
Call Detective Moreno
and give it a try.

00:23:23,357 --> 00:23:25,693
Yeah, okay.

00:23:33,534 --> 00:23:34,969
All right, keep them out.

00:23:35,036 --> 00:23:37,271
OFFICER:
All right, folks, you heard
the man. Stay behind the tape.

00:23:39,807 --> 00:23:41,842
(sighs)

00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:43,377
Okay, Danny,
this is

00:23:43,444 --> 00:23:45,179
the standard
after-shooting walk-through.

00:23:45,246 --> 00:23:47,348
I'm CSI Stokes.

00:23:47,415 --> 00:23:50,318
I'm going to be asking you
a few questions, okay?

00:23:50,384 --> 00:23:52,053
Why not?
Everybody else is.

00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:54,388
When you arrived on the scene,
according to your statement,

00:23:54,455 --> 00:23:56,390
Officer Johnson had his gun
drawn and was shooting.

00:23:56,457 --> 00:23:57,391
Is that correct?

00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:58,426
Yeah, that's right.

00:23:58,492 --> 00:24:00,127
Could you see
what he was shooting at?

00:24:02,563 --> 00:24:05,099
I could not see his target.

00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:06,601
I could not see his face.

00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:08,936
But I saw the gun,
and I saw him firing.

00:24:09,003 --> 00:24:11,606
And that was, uh, that was
in this direction, right?

00:24:11,672 --> 00:24:12,707
No.

00:24:12,773 --> 00:24:13,708
Turn to your right.

00:24:13,774 --> 00:24:15,343
More.

00:24:17,345 --> 00:24:18,579
That's it.

00:24:18,646 --> 00:24:20,781
So he was facing away from you?

00:24:22,683 --> 00:24:25,386
Why'd you make the decision
to shoot?

00:24:25,453 --> 00:24:26,387
Screw you.

00:24:26,454 --> 00:24:27,388
What?
Hey, hey, hey.

00:24:27,455 --> 00:24:28,923
No, I am so sick
of everybody

00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,224
and their kid brother
second-guessing me.

00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:31,459
Hey, I'm not
second-guessing you!

00:24:31,526 --> 00:24:33,094
You know what?
If you knew anything,

00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,530
you'd know that a guy with a gun
in this neighborhood...

00:24:35,596 --> 00:24:36,531
ITHACA:
Watch it.
What?!

00:24:36,597 --> 00:24:37,532
It's a black neighborhood.

00:24:37,598 --> 00:24:38,566
Look at their faces.

00:24:38,633 --> 00:24:39,634
Tell me I'm wrong.
(crowd murmurs)

00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,468
Don't go there.

00:24:40,535 --> 00:24:41,569
It's you people

00:24:41,636 --> 00:24:43,404
I was trying to save!
All right, shut up!

00:24:43,471 --> 00:24:45,106
Mitch, get him
out of here.

00:24:45,172 --> 00:24:47,475
I put my life on the line
every day for you people!

00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:48,976
What have you ever
done for me, huh?

00:24:49,043 --> 00:24:50,278
You got
a death wish, buddy?

00:24:50,344 --> 00:24:51,412
And you know what?!

00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:53,548
Every bad thing
that happened to you people,

00:24:53,614 --> 00:24:54,749
it's not my fault.

00:24:54,815 --> 00:24:55,616
Got it?!

00:24:55,683 --> 00:24:57,118
It's not my fault!

00:24:57,185 --> 00:24:58,119
Let's go.

00:24:58,186 --> 00:24:59,587
Let go of me!

00:24:59,654 --> 00:25:01,389
I can't defend this guy.

00:25:01,455 --> 00:25:03,057
All right, all right, all right.

00:25:03,124 --> 00:25:05,560
He's kind of prickly, isn't he?

00:25:05,626 --> 00:25:06,894
Well, let's cut him
some slack.

00:25:06,961 --> 00:25:09,297
He's under a lot of pressure.
You know.

00:25:09,363 --> 00:25:12,233
Well, at least now we know
where Johnson was shooting.

00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,336
And I'm thinking
it was Anthony Lopez

00:25:15,403 --> 00:25:17,805
that Johnson
was meeting here.

00:25:17,872 --> 00:25:20,675
And Johnson was shooting
at whoever killed Anthony.

00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:25,479
I got what looks like
a bullet hole here, Jim.

00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:30,151
BRASS:
Missing hubcaps,
flat tire.

00:25:30,218 --> 00:25:31,485
You don't park in
this neighborhood

00:25:31,552 --> 00:25:34,956
unless your car's
not worth stealing.

00:25:35,022 --> 00:25:36,824
Look at that.

00:25:38,693 --> 00:25:40,294
.38 expanded hollow-point,

00:25:40,361 --> 00:25:43,497
with what looks like traces
of blood and tissue.

00:25:43,564 --> 00:25:44,699
We'll find out.

00:25:44,765 --> 00:25:46,767
Well, Johnson
was shooting a .38.

00:25:49,871 --> 00:25:51,439
Hey, Nick.
Yeah?

00:25:51,505 --> 00:25:53,507
I got a trail.

00:25:53,574 --> 00:25:56,310
Yep.

00:25:56,377 --> 00:25:57,478
Right here.

00:26:07,655 --> 00:26:09,023
It's blood.

00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:15,196
Whatever Johnson was
shooting at, he hit.

00:26:15,263 --> 00:26:17,265
All right, this program
links evidence

00:26:17,331 --> 00:26:18,833
from gang-related crimes

00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,736
in a fraction of the time
it used to take us to do it.

00:26:21,802 --> 00:26:23,304
We input all the
evidence we've got

00:26:23,371 --> 00:26:24,972
and compare it
against the database,

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,507
starting with ballistics.

00:26:26,574 --> 00:26:29,010
Each dot represents a crime
involving firearms.

00:26:29,076 --> 00:26:31,345
And that, that's
just the last year.

00:26:31,412 --> 00:26:33,214
Wow. I leave town for a while

00:26:33,281 --> 00:26:34,815

Pretty cool.

00:26:38,452 --> 00:26:39,554
Showing you guys something new.

00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,190
Let's hope it works.

00:26:42,256 --> 00:26:43,391
Oh, it works.

00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:46,294
You see?
Four gangs favor

00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,095
jacketed hollow-point
nine-mils.

00:26:50,097 --> 00:26:51,699
All right, let's input
the sneaker print.

00:26:55,703 --> 00:26:57,805
"Cause and manner of death:
exsanguination

00:26:57,872 --> 00:27:01,142
due to GSWs."

00:27:01,209 --> 00:27:02,910
All right, we're down
to two possible gangs.

00:27:02,977 --> 00:27:04,845
Let's input the location
where we found the victim--

00:27:04,912 --> 00:27:05,846
Madison and Fifth.

00:27:05,913 --> 00:27:07,114

They run Garfield Street,
where Lopez lived.

00:27:16,224 --> 00:27:19,260
Adams is outside
of their territory.

00:27:19,327 --> 00:27:21,829
So, Anthony Lopez and Sergeant
Johnson probably thought

00:27:21,896 --> 00:27:23,064
they were meeting
somewhere safe.

00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,533
Do you have a log of all
the known D-Street Killers

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,701
in the database?

00:27:26,767 --> 00:27:29,537
Except the ones that are
dead or incarcerated.

00:27:29,604 --> 00:27:30,771
Yeah.

00:27:35,076 --> 00:27:38,045
I'll round them up.

I analyzed the bullet
that you found here,

00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:34,802
under Sergeant Johnson's body.

00:28:34,869 --> 00:28:38,673
It had manufacturer's
petroleum sealant on the base.

00:28:38,739 --> 00:28:39,974
That's not uncommon.

00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:41,976
It keeps moisture from
getting into the cartridge.

00:28:42,043 --> 00:28:43,678
Right, but I did not
find any sealant

00:28:43,744 --> 00:28:45,179
on any of Finn's other bullets.

00:28:45,246 --> 00:28:46,881
Which also is not uncommon.

00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:51,919
Did you find sealant
on any of the cartridge cases?

00:28:51,986 --> 00:28:54,288
Bear with me, wise one.

00:28:54,355 --> 00:28:57,592
There was no sealant
on the cartridge case Nick found

00:28:57,658 --> 00:28:58,926
under the fence.

00:28:58,993 --> 00:29:03,197
However, I did find sealant
on one cartridge case:

00:29:03,264 --> 00:29:05,700
the cartridge case
that you found

00:29:05,766 --> 00:29:07,768
in the windshield
of the patrol car.

00:29:07,835 --> 00:29:10,271
STOKES:
So the bullet we thought
was the coup de grâce

00:29:10,338 --> 00:29:12,440
was fired from the cartridge
case on the patrol car?

00:29:12,506 --> 00:29:14,475
40 feet from Johnson.

00:29:14,542 --> 00:29:16,110
That's not a coup de grâce.

00:29:16,177 --> 00:29:17,645
HODGES:
And in addition

00:29:17,712 --> 00:29:19,714
to the sealant, there were
denim fibers in the nose

00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,115
of the bullet
found under Johnson.

00:29:21,182 --> 00:29:22,683
He was wearing jeans.

00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,751
(gunshot)

00:29:26,754 --> 00:29:29,390
He landed on top of the bullet
that went through his leg.

00:29:29,457 --> 00:29:30,625
LANGSTON:
The first bullet
I found

00:29:30,691 --> 00:29:32,360
was the one that went
through his back.

00:29:32,426 --> 00:29:33,461
STOKES:
We can't be sure.

00:29:33,528 --> 00:29:34,729
Without
corresponding trace,

00:29:34,795 --> 00:29:37,131
we can't match bullets
to cartridge cases.

00:29:37,198 --> 00:29:39,667
There was trace
on the cartridge case

00:29:39,734 --> 00:29:41,235
near the fence.

00:29:41,302 --> 00:29:43,871
And this is where
it gets really sticky.

00:29:43,938 --> 00:29:46,807
STOKES:
"Grape juice, corn syrup,
fruit pectin,

00:29:46,874 --> 00:29:50,978
citric acid, sodium citrate."

00:29:51,045 --> 00:29:52,747
It had grape jelly on it?

00:29:52,813 --> 00:29:54,348
Yes.

00:29:54,415 --> 00:29:57,752
And there was a fingerprint.

00:29:57,818 --> 00:30:00,321
Mandy ran it-- no hits.

00:30:00,388 --> 00:30:03,391
If there was jelly on the
cartridge before it was fired,

00:30:03,457 --> 00:30:05,226
it would have burned off
in the chamber.

00:30:05,293 --> 00:30:09,230
So somebody had to have
touched it after it was fired.

00:30:09,297 --> 00:30:11,065
Which means somebody
moved the evidence.

00:30:11,132 --> 00:30:13,167
The scene was secure
within minutes.

00:30:13,234 --> 00:30:15,002
The only people
that were there

00:30:15,069 --> 00:30:17,405
were Officers Finn
and Grayson

00:30:17,471 --> 00:30:19,040
and the witnesses
at the burger joint.

00:30:19,106 --> 00:30:20,942
Which doesn't
serve breakfast--

00:30:21,008 --> 00:30:23,244
only burgers, fries,
and ice cream.

00:30:23,311 --> 00:30:25,580
No jelly in the kitchen
or on the menu.

00:30:25,646 --> 00:30:26,581
But check this out.

00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:29,383
There's a
jelly packet.

00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:32,220
Right by the toy truck.

00:30:32,286 --> 00:30:35,690
I know who touched
the cartridge case.

00:30:35,756 --> 00:30:38,960
I like French fries
with jelly.

00:30:39,026 --> 00:30:41,529
Puts grape jelly on everything--

00:30:41,596 --> 00:30:45,066
macaroni, eggs, carrots.

00:30:45,132 --> 00:30:47,268
I take those jelly packs
from breakfast spots,

00:30:47,335 --> 00:30:48,736
so I always have some handy.

00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:52,240
Else-wise, baby
won't eat at all.

00:30:52,306 --> 00:30:54,075
Avery, last night,

00:30:54,141 --> 00:30:56,444
when everybody ran outside,

00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,112
did you touch anything?

00:30:58,179 --> 00:30:59,447
WOMAN:
He didn't touch
anything.

00:30:59,513 --> 00:31:01,782
It was all I could do
to keep him

00:31:01,849 --> 00:31:02,950
from having to see that...

00:31:03,017 --> 00:31:05,186
that man that was sick
in the parking lot.

00:31:10,358 --> 00:31:13,828
I'd like your consent
to run his fingerprints.

00:31:13,895 --> 00:31:16,230
Could help us clear up
a critical part

00:31:16,297 --> 00:31:19,033
of our investigation.

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,007
Avery,

00:31:26,073 --> 00:31:28,843
can you do this
with your finger?

00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,011
Put it right there.

00:31:30,077 --> 00:31:31,679
All right, that's good.

00:31:33,381 --> 00:31:35,516
(beeping)

00:31:37,818 --> 00:31:40,154
He did find something.

00:31:40,221 --> 00:31:42,223
(sirens blaring)

00:31:50,298 --> 00:31:51,232
What you doing?

00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:53,634
Put that down.

00:31:57,438 --> 00:32:00,274
He didn't know
what he was doing.

00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:02,710
He's not in any trouble, ma'am.

00:32:02,777 --> 00:32:07,682
But he did help us prove
that Officer Finn didn't hurt

00:32:07,748 --> 00:32:10,751
Sergeant Johnson after
he was already down.

00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,992
Witnesses often

00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:21,262
merge what they actually saw
with prior assumptions.

00:32:34,475 --> 00:32:36,777
Well, good news is,

00:32:36,844 --> 00:32:40,548
CSIs proved you didn't
commit a coup de grâce.

00:32:40,615 --> 00:32:42,517
The bad news?

00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:45,720
Excuse me.

00:32:49,824 --> 00:32:51,325
You're still on
administrative leave.

00:32:51,392 --> 00:32:54,295
Because of your
recent outburst,

00:32:54,362 --> 00:32:56,197
they aren't gonna issue you
a replacement weapon

00:32:56,264 --> 00:32:58,232
until you get cleared
by a department shrink.

00:32:58,299 --> 00:33:02,069
When you shot a cop,
is that what you did, Jim?

00:33:02,136 --> 00:33:04,205
Did you cry on some couch
to a shrink?

00:33:04,272 --> 00:33:06,107
Come on, Danny.
Come on.

00:33:08,976 --> 00:33:10,344
I know the deal.
I know the depression.

00:33:10,411 --> 00:33:12,513
But you know, you should
look at the bright side.

00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:15,049
You're on paid leave,
so why don't you go somewhere?

00:33:15,116 --> 00:33:18,019
Take a vacation. Go to a beach.
Go play golf.

00:33:18,085 --> 00:33:20,054
Go make love to your wife
in the afternoon.

00:33:20,121 --> 00:33:21,956

anymore.

00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:34,268
Hey, hey, come on,

it to you straight.

00:33:41,342 --> 00:33:43,544

a favor?

back home with me.

working patrol then.

00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:06,977
That's for sure.

00:42:07,044 --> 00:42:09,313
Probably too proud to go out
on a disability,

00:42:09,379 --> 00:42:11,248
even though
it's a better pension.

00:42:11,315 --> 00:42:15,152
I have to say he was a pretty
good shot for a blind guy.

00:42:15,218 --> 00:42:18,088
Ironically, because his vision
was so constrained,

00:42:18,155 --> 00:42:20,524
he was able to focus on

00:42:20,591 --> 00:42:21,825
the immediate threat.

00:42:21,892 --> 00:42:23,427
And there's
one more thing.

00:42:23,493 --> 00:42:25,329
Officer Finn's
patrol car was parked

00:42:25,395 --> 00:42:29,499
at an angle where his headlights
wouldn't have picked up Johnson,

00:42:29,566 --> 00:42:33,937
which means that that light
put him in silhouette.

00:42:42,613 --> 00:42:44,248
It's like the
perfect storm:

00:42:44,314 --> 00:42:48,919
his condition, at night
with this lighting.

00:42:48,986 --> 00:42:51,221
Finn couldn't have known
it was Johnson.

00:42:51,288 --> 00:42:53,523
Finn took action

00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:55,692
in the line of duty,

00:42:55,759 --> 00:42:58,495
and Johnson was trying
to help a kid at risk.

00:43:00,497 --> 00:43:02,666
So where's the bad guy in this?

00:43:04,368 --> 00:43:06,637
You tell me.
