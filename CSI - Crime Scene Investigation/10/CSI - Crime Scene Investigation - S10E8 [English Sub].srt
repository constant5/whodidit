I'll tell you though...

Oh, man.

How many times has this been
done, J.T., in history?

00:00:57,249 --> 00:00:58,183

Three times.

00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,685
Only three times.

00:00:59,752 --> 00:01:00,853

00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:02,788
Chevy Cigs has got
to pick them both up

00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,823
to make this
a win for him.

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,258
If not, X-Man wins

00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:08,093
and becomes the new champion.

00:09:29,372 --> 00:09:30,740
<i>Then she heard the shot,</i>

00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:34,710
<i>found the body, called 911.</i>

00:09:34,777 --> 00:09:36,479
Was the sister
ever a suspect?

00:09:36,546 --> 00:09:37,880
Unfortunately, no.

00:09:37,947 --> 00:09:39,882
She'd been on a date
earlier that evening,

00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:41,617
with a movie ticket
stub to prove it.

00:09:41,684 --> 00:09:43,252
Taxi dropped her
off at the house.

00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:45,221
Cabbie confirmed
angry voices inside.

00:09:45,288 --> 00:09:47,023
Sister claims
she was out back

00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:49,492
trying to get away
from the noise.

00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:55,898
Are you certain there was
no one else in the house?

00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:57,500
Just the vic's
11-month-old daughter

00:09:57,567 --> 00:09:59,502
in the master
bedroom crib.

00:10:00,536 --> 00:10:02,805
I tried to get
Carla to plead out.

00:10:02,872 --> 00:10:05,141
She just wouldn't do it.

00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:08,044
Jury came back guilty
in five hours.

00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,179
She was dead five
hours after that.

00:10:10,246 --> 00:10:12,615
Why are you so interested
in the original case?

00:10:12,682 --> 00:10:15,218
This woman hung herself
over the verdict.

00:10:15,284 --> 00:10:17,186
I would like to know why.

00:10:17,253 --> 00:10:18,955
You're thorough.

00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:21,190
I heard that about you.

00:10:21,257 --> 00:10:22,859
Is there anything else
you need from me?

00:10:22,925 --> 00:10:25,194
No. No, thanks.

00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:26,629
Take care.

00:10:28,965 --> 00:10:31,434
You know, I brought
Carla's kid to the jail

00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:34,470
a few times to visit her
while she was awaiting trial.

00:10:34,537 --> 00:10:37,306
She always used to tell her,
her dad was on vacation

00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:39,375
and that he loved her very much.

00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,545
It's kind of sad, huh?

00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:01,697
Ah, just in time

00:11:01,764 --> 00:11:02,965
for the headtopsy.

00:11:03,032 --> 00:11:05,601
I heard someone
was using this one
as a bowling ball.

00:11:05,668 --> 00:11:07,870
Well, his head <i>is</i>
very spherical.

00:11:07,937 --> 00:11:10,873
My father had bowling alleys
in every one of his casinos.

00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,143
I liked everything
about them but the bowling.

00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,379
Rented shoes
that you have to disinfect

00:11:16,445 --> 00:11:17,713
before you put them on.

00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,649
Not for me.

00:11:19,715 --> 00:11:22,018
This looks like
manual saw strokes.

00:11:23,252 --> 00:11:26,389
Probably a handsaw
or a box saw.

00:11:26,455 --> 00:11:28,357
Multiple cuts
from multiple angles,

00:11:28,424 --> 00:11:29,692
hesitation marks.

00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,195
Whoever did this
wasn't skilled.

00:11:32,261 --> 00:11:35,097
Lack of hemorrhagic
tissue suggests

00:11:35,164 --> 00:11:37,433
decapitation was postmortem.

00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,302
What do you think this is?

00:11:40,336 --> 00:11:42,905
Has an alveolar texture.

00:11:42,972 --> 00:11:44,440
Lung tissue?
Mm-hmm.

00:11:44,507 --> 00:11:46,275
How'd it end up in his nose?

00:11:46,342 --> 00:11:47,743
Maybe the vic suffered

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:50,680
some kind of traumatic injury
to the chest, like a gunshot.

00:11:50,746 --> 00:11:52,215
(gunshot)

00:11:55,651 --> 00:11:58,020
Could be C.O.D.

00:11:58,087 --> 00:12:00,223
We found this guy

00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:01,290
in Ronny's car,

00:12:01,357 --> 00:12:03,259
and he has a pretty
long rap sheet.

00:12:03,326 --> 00:12:06,028
Oh, yeah,
that's Vitas.

00:12:06,095 --> 00:12:08,464
He was going through
some really hard times,

00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:11,067
and Ronny was
helping him out.

00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:13,536
Do you think
he killed Ronny?

00:12:13,603 --> 00:12:14,804
We don't know.

00:12:14,871 --> 00:12:17,874
When was the last time
that you saw Ronny alive?

00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,012
Earlier today; he was working.

00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:25,181
You know, before...

00:12:25,248 --> 00:12:27,283
his-his head...

00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,585
You know.

00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:33,222
Did he have any enemies
that you know of?

00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:34,924
Just himself.

00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:37,660
He wanted to be pro,

00:12:37,727 --> 00:12:40,096
but he ended up
being the shoe boy,

00:12:40,163 --> 00:12:42,632
and it really started
getting to him.

00:12:42,698 --> 00:12:44,634
So he gave up on his dream.

00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,402
No, his dream
gave up on him.

00:12:46,469 --> 00:12:48,171
He definitely had
the physical ability.

00:12:48,237 --> 00:12:49,772
I don't know anyone

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,108
that could throw
a harder ball.

00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:55,411
He even beat the X-Man
the other day in a pickup game.

00:12:55,478 --> 00:12:58,314
I-I know this is weird

00:12:58,381 --> 00:13:00,149
to say after what
just happened...

00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:04,954
...but he just didn't really
have it all up here.

that I'm the best bowler
in the place, all right?

I doubt that.

Tell me about you
and Chevy Cigs.

00:16:19,328 --> 00:16:22,064
He's, uh, he's old school.
I'm new.

He uses a three-finger grip,
I use a no-finger grip.

00:16:25,368 --> 00:16:26,435

00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:28,871

But he's the only guy
you never beat on the tour.

You know,
I did some research

the head rolled out.

00:19:42,698 --> 00:19:44,567
Now, according to Brass,

00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:47,703
our vic played Kevin X
the night before.

00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,206
So, I went through
those photos

00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,308
and I found this.

00:19:55,077 --> 00:19:56,345
STOKES:
Hey, I know that guy.

00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:59,248
Know where he works, too.

00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:09,025
BRASS:
We're looking for Vitas Ling.

00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:10,826
MAN:
Back there.

00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,648
WILLOWS:
You recognize that smell?

00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:22,004
Hey, Cheech.

00:20:22,071 --> 00:20:24,507
BRASS:
Got your hands on a little
chronic, eh, <i>hombre?</i>

00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:27,777
Whoa, all right?

00:20:27,843 --> 00:20:30,346
Everybody just
calm down, okay?

00:20:30,413 --> 00:20:32,348
It's medicinal.
I got a bad back, all right?

00:20:32,415 --> 00:20:33,683
I got it at a dispensary.

00:20:33,749 --> 00:20:35,551
I got my card in my wallet
right here.

00:20:35,618 --> 00:20:38,587
Keep your hands
where we can see them.

00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,023
Okay.
This is Nevada, pal.

00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,725
You want to play that,
go back to Cali.

00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:43,993
STOKES:
"Going Back to Cali."

00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,161
That's a good
rap song.

00:20:45,227 --> 00:20:46,729
BRASS:
Yeah, I'm channeling

00:20:46,796 --> 00:20:48,397
Notorious B.I.G.,
can't you tell?

00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:51,267
Hey, Jim, go ahead
and take "High Times"
back to the station.

00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:53,469
Nick and I are gonna get a
little familiar with this place.

00:20:53,536 --> 00:20:54,870
Oh, come on!

00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:01,811
I've got a box saw over here.

00:21:01,877 --> 00:21:04,814
It's the same type of saw used
to cut off the victim's head.

00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:18,494
I think we just found
the victim's head remover.

00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,372
Got some more blood over here.

00:21:29,438 --> 00:21:32,875
<i>Trail looks like</i>
<i>it goes outside.</i>

00:21:42,118 --> 00:21:44,353
STOKES:
See that... right there?

00:21:46,022 --> 00:21:48,124
Then it kind of stops.

00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:09,078
Positive for blood.

00:22:10,112 --> 00:22:11,747
C.O.D.

00:22:11,814 --> 00:22:12,915
is gunshot to the chest.

00:22:12,982 --> 00:22:14,917
This could be where
Ronald Tobin was killed.

00:22:16,652 --> 00:22:18,954
STOKES:
Medium velocity spatter.

00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:21,424
Could be from
an exiting bullet.

00:22:31,634 --> 00:22:33,636
Nine millimeter.

00:22:33,703 --> 00:22:35,771
Remington Golden Saber.

00:22:39,742 --> 00:22:41,844
There's a trail
of wood splinters.

00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,881
Somebody was dragging
something made of wood.

00:22:52,755 --> 00:22:54,090
(groans softly)

00:22:54,156 --> 00:22:55,992
You recognize that smell?

00:22:56,058 --> 00:22:59,061
Yes, ma'am.
Unfortunately.

00:23:03,232 --> 00:23:06,202
Staphylinidae beetles.

00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:08,704
Clean up crew.

00:23:32,228 --> 00:23:34,125
BRASS:
Who's that?

00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:36,185
That you?

00:23:36,209 --> 00:23:39,012
Can you see through
those slits, buddy?

00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:40,514
Yeah, man.

00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,349
I was knocking over pins
for Ron Ron.

00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:44,718
He called me up, said he was
bowling against some pro

00:23:44,785 --> 00:23:46,053
and he needed
my help.

00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:47,320
So, you were cheating for him?

00:23:47,387 --> 00:23:48,588
Yeah.

00:23:48,655 --> 00:23:49,856
20 bucks a pin.

00:23:49,923 --> 00:23:52,693
I knocked over, like,
ten that night.

00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:54,261
(clicks tongue)
It's easy money.

00:23:54,328 --> 00:23:55,929
It was easy money
for your drug dealer.

00:23:55,996 --> 00:23:57,831
'Cause everything you get
goes to him.

00:23:57,898 --> 00:24:00,167
Right?
Unless, Ron Ron

00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:02,536
wasn't breaking you off
with your paycheck on time?

00:24:02,602 --> 00:24:03,770
Of course he did.

00:24:03,837 --> 00:24:05,038
He was a stand-up dude.

00:24:05,105 --> 00:24:06,373
Stand-up dudes don't cheat.

00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,709
He only was doing this
to impress his girl Shea.

00:24:08,775 --> 00:24:10,410
Stand-up dudes don't steal.

00:24:10,477 --> 00:24:12,412
He only stole that stuff
because he was a fan.

00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:14,081
I never seen him sell any of it.

00:24:14,147 --> 00:24:15,415
Well, maybe you were selling it,

00:24:15,482 --> 00:24:17,217
and you didn't cut him in
on his action.

00:24:17,284 --> 00:24:21,088
You... you think <i>I</i> killed him?

00:24:21,154 --> 00:24:23,924
You were caught sleeping
in Ronald's car.

00:24:23,991 --> 00:24:25,959
He was shot,
he had his head cut off.

00:24:26,026 --> 00:24:28,962
He was thrown away
like a piece of garbage,

00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:31,798
and all this happened
at your place of employment.

00:24:31,865 --> 00:24:33,867
And you're telling me you didn't
know anything about it?

00:24:33,934 --> 00:24:35,869
No, I didn't.

00:24:35,936 --> 00:24:39,339
Look, I may be a-a-a broke,
homeless druggie,

00:24:39,406 --> 00:24:41,408
but I ain't no killer.

00:24:47,547 --> 00:24:49,416
Okay.

00:24:49,483 --> 00:24:51,485
That should do it.

00:25:13,206 --> 00:25:15,776
This is the bullet's
true path.

00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,212
Shot came from
the backyard.

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,214
Yes.

00:25:21,281 --> 00:25:23,250
And with any luck,

00:25:23,316 --> 00:25:27,020
this overhang
will have protected this area

00:25:27,087 --> 00:25:28,255
from the elements.

00:25:28,321 --> 00:25:31,291
Maybe we can still get GSR.

00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:42,369
Don't you put your hands on me!
That's enough!

00:25:50,777 --> 00:25:53,080
Well, the sister told the truth
about one thing--

00:25:53,146 --> 00:25:56,149
she was exactly
where she said she was.

00:25:58,118 --> 00:26:01,054
Autopsy confirms that the victim
died of a single gunshot wound

00:26:01,121 --> 00:26:02,923
through the left lung.

00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,192
All of the blood at the scene
was from our victim.

00:26:05,258 --> 00:26:07,828
No hits on the bullet
and no prints on the saw.

00:26:07,894 --> 00:26:09,329
There were two sets of prints
on the bloody roller bag--

00:26:09,396 --> 00:26:12,532
the victim's and
Kevin X's.

00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:15,002
Kevin X.

00:26:15,068 --> 00:26:17,804
Okay, we know
that the victim

00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:19,473
and his pal Vitas
were partners in crime,

00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:21,508
stealing whatever
they could get their hands on.

00:26:21,575 --> 00:26:23,844
But if these two guys
are the best we got,

00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,178
I'm a little worried.

00:26:25,245 --> 00:26:26,847
Both of them were
at the front of the lanes

00:26:26,913 --> 00:26:28,615
when Ronald's head popped out--
Kevin was bowling,

00:26:28,682 --> 00:26:30,650
Vitas was
in the crowd.

00:26:30,717 --> 00:26:31,818
I mean, how could
either one of them

00:26:31,885 --> 00:26:33,286
have put the head
in the ball pit?

00:26:33,353 --> 00:26:35,288
You're right about Kevin--
he was bowling the whole time,

00:26:35,355 --> 00:26:36,590
and we have the footage

00:26:36,657 --> 00:26:38,091
to prove it.
Which leaves Vitas.

00:26:38,158 --> 00:26:39,326
Is it possible

00:26:39,393 --> 00:26:41,294
that he put the head
in the ball pit

00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:42,896
and made it around

00:26:42,963 --> 00:26:44,831
to the front of the lanes
in time?

00:26:44,898 --> 00:26:46,166
And obviously it's going
to take a little longer

00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:47,601
for a ball to make it back
to the return

00:26:47,668 --> 00:26:48,969
if it's pushing a human head.

00:26:49,036 --> 00:26:50,804
It also depends
on the pinsetter.

00:26:50,871 --> 00:26:52,806
Some are faster than others.

00:26:52,873 --> 00:26:56,143
The automated scoring
computer clocked

00:26:56,209 --> 00:26:59,813
Chevy's first throw of the
tenth frame at 8:47.

00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,616
The head appeared in the return
just 18 seconds later.

00:27:02,683 --> 00:27:04,151
So, you're telling me
that Vitas

00:27:04,217 --> 00:27:07,320
dropped the head in the ball pit
and then made it all the way

00:27:07,387 --> 00:27:10,557
back around to the front
of Chevy's lane in 18 seconds?

00:27:12,025 --> 00:27:14,394
I don't know if weed head
could've pulled that off.

00:27:14,461 --> 00:27:17,097
I mean, look at him.

00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:20,901
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

00:27:31,211 --> 00:27:32,512
Are you ready?

00:27:38,051 --> 00:27:39,252
It's in.

00:27:58,338 --> 00:28:00,273
13 seconds.

00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,609
(panting)
Good job.

00:28:05,145 --> 00:28:07,781
It's five seconds faster
than the pinsetter.

00:28:07,848 --> 00:28:09,349
I don't know, man.

00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:11,351
Add in the crowd, it's doable.

00:28:11,418 --> 00:28:13,053
Even for Vitas.

00:28:16,423 --> 00:28:19,359
SIDLE:
This is the raw broadcast
footage of the tournament.

00:28:19,426 --> 00:28:22,029
We have all the camera angles.

00:28:22,095 --> 00:28:25,332
So, this is the moment that
Ronald's head appeared.

00:28:27,367 --> 00:28:29,603
And there's Vitas.

00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,071
Back it up.

00:28:31,138 --> 00:28:33,907
Let's see
where he came from.

00:28:33,974 --> 00:28:35,909
This is a few
moments prior.

00:28:35,976 --> 00:28:37,911
And Vitas doesn't move.

00:28:37,978 --> 00:28:39,946
He stayed there
the entire time.

00:28:40,013 --> 00:28:43,216
But the vic's
girlfriend is moving.

00:28:43,283 --> 00:28:44,785
Do you have a wider angle?

00:28:47,988 --> 00:28:50,590
Can you zoom in,
track her movement?

00:28:50,657 --> 00:28:52,025
Yep.

00:28:58,498 --> 00:29:00,233
She's coming

00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,735
from the back side
of the lanes.

00:29:01,802 --> 00:29:04,171
And apparently
she's one hell of an actress.

00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,083
WOMAN:
<i>So are you sure you're going</i>
<i>to be okay with her?</i>

00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,518
Oh, yeah. I love them
when they're this age.

00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:15,021
Hello. Hey, you want
to be in CODIS?

00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:18,491
(little girl gibbering)

00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:21,227
Let's go play with CODIS.
Okay, we can play...

00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:23,796
Right this way.

00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:28,467
Go ahead
and have a seat.

00:29:30,503 --> 00:29:33,039
So?

00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,541
You said you had some
information about my sister.

00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:39,378
Actually, it's about
your sister's husband,

00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,380
James York.

00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:44,784
We were able to determine
that she didn't kill him.

00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,853
What good is that going to do
her now? There's no point.

00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,188
You killed him.

00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:51,857
Didn't you, Hannah?

00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:53,326
James York liked to play around.

00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:55,194
I suspect that he was playing
around with you.

00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:58,197
And maybe you didn't
intend to kill him,

00:29:58,264 --> 00:29:59,532
but after you shot him,

00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:02,034
you never thought your sister
would go down for it.

00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:05,037
Now, we know you didn't
try to frame her.

00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:08,374
That was just an accident
of bullets and geometry.

00:30:08,441 --> 00:30:11,711
The D.A. is going
to press charges.

00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:14,747
Just come clean now.

00:30:25,258 --> 00:30:26,259
Thank you.

00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,695
Hannah...

00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,466
...spare yourself the trouble
and the pain

00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:35,468
of going through another trial.

00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:38,437
Would it make any difference

00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:42,275
if you knew that James York
was a piece of garbage?

00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,610
I wouldn't have touched him
with a ten foot pole.

00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:46,879
You know he had three
other children

00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:48,915
with other women.

00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:51,984
Sweet little kids he'd already
managed to screw up.

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,656
I loved my sister,

00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:59,158
but she was never very bright.

00:30:59,225 --> 00:31:03,162
And she was an idiot to
stay with a man like that.

00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:05,164
Their daughter...

00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:07,166
my daughter...

00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:10,169
is two years old now.

00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:13,639
And I tell her that I love her
every day.

00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:17,143
And she knows I really mean it.

00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:21,080
Whoever killed James York
did her a favor.

00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:28,588
(voice breaking):
That should make a difference.

00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:33,225
It's not for me to judge.

00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:36,295
You're going to have to go
with this officer now.

00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:59,051
Did you go behind the lanes

00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:02,321
the night that
Ronald was killed?

00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:04,390
Mm-mmm.

00:32:04,457 --> 00:32:06,892
Oh. That.

00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,895
That was
when I ran to my car

00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:10,863
to get my birth
control pills.

00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:13,266
And you were running because...?

00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:15,268
Well, because I didn't want
to miss the match.

00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:16,702
I wanted to find out
who won.

00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:18,771
(door opens)

00:32:18,838 --> 00:32:20,439
Ms. Lammet,

00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:24,243
I found this
in your apartment.

00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,480
This is <i>the</i> hot designer
bag of the moment.

00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:29,749
Every woman wants one,
including me, but...

00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:32,018
we just don't make
that kind of money.

00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:33,452
What's your secret, Shea?

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,222
It was a gift.

00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:37,590
From Ronny?

00:32:37,657 --> 00:32:39,058
Your boyfriend makes less
than you do.

00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:42,295
WILLOWS:
Oh, but you know, it could
be from his side biz.

00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:44,063
Except...

00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,766
this bag has been
slashed with a razor,

00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:48,367
and totally ruined.

00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:52,638
No woman I know would do this
to this bag.

00:32:52,705 --> 00:32:54,740
And if a guy is splurging
on something like this,

00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:56,042
he's not going to destroy it.

00:32:56,108 --> 00:32:57,443
Who did you get it from?

00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:06,852
Chevy Cigs
gave it to me.

00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:08,721
You know,
the famous bowler.

00:33:08,788 --> 00:33:10,222
Yeah.
Yeah, we know him.

00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:12,124
How did you meet him?

00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:14,894
I served him at the alley
a couple times.

00:33:14,961 --> 00:33:18,864
He lives in the area,
so he would come in to practice.

00:33:18,931 --> 00:33:20,933
You started dating?

00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:24,437
We fell in love, actually.

00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:28,274
So, what happened, Chev?

00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:31,244
So, you meet cute little Shea
at the bowling alley, right?

00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,846
And you're itching to roll
your balls down another lane.

00:33:33,913 --> 00:33:35,081
You know what I mean?

00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:37,750
So, you wine her,
you dine her, you buy her.

00:33:37,817 --> 00:33:40,486
Then the boyfriend finds out,
and he slices up

00:33:40,553 --> 00:33:43,022
the purse you gave her,
so the boyfriend's got to go?

00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:45,258
Hey, I didn't kill anybody.
You're the only one

00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:47,360
with a registered nine
millimeter in the bowling alley.

00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:48,794
Now, you know
we searched your house.

00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,429
We didn't find the weapon,
but we found

00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:52,265
a box of Remington
Golden Sabers,

00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:54,867
the same ammo used
to kill Ronald Tobin.

00:33:54,934 --> 00:33:56,135
So, where's the gun?

00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:57,970
She must have
stolen it from me.

00:33:58,037 --> 00:33:59,505
So you're saying
that Shea killed Ronald?

00:33:59,572 --> 00:34:00,539
She had to, right?

00:34:00,606 --> 00:34:02,208
Did she tell you
that she killed Ronald?

00:34:02,275 --> 00:34:03,509
No.

00:34:03,576 --> 00:34:04,777
Look,

00:34:04,844 --> 00:34:06,946
I broke up with her
because Ronald found out.

00:34:07,013 --> 00:34:09,115
And I guess she was thinking,
with Ronald gone,

00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:10,816
maybe I'd get back together
with her.

00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:12,585
You're telling me
that Shea killed Ronald

00:34:12,652 --> 00:34:15,621
and cut his head off
just to mess up your game?

00:34:15,688 --> 00:34:17,890
She did that
because she's nuts.

00:34:17,957 --> 00:34:19,926
Because I didn't get
back together with her,

00:34:19,992 --> 00:34:22,028
and I guess it's
her idea of revenge.

00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,365
That's the truth.
I got nothing to hide.

00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,501
I got a big match tonight.

00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:31,070
Can I go now?

00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:33,272
SIDLE:
<i>If Chevy's telling the truth...</i>

00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:36,242
then Shea did
everything by herself.

00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:37,643
It doesn't add up.

00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,811
Let's see.

00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:40,846
She shoots him,
cuts off his head,

00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:42,949
picks him up,
tosses him in a crate,

00:34:43,015 --> 00:34:45,685
then drags the crate
across a parking lot.

00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:49,188
And I think Ronald weighed
about 180 pounds,

00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:50,723
minus his head.

00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,325
Add the crate.

00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:53,593
I'd say it's unlikely.

00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,161
She must have had help.

00:35:25,057 --> 00:35:26,792
♪ ♪

00:35:58,124 --> 00:36:00,626
(computer trilling,
then beeps twice)

00:36:00,693 --> 00:36:03,663
SIMMS:
The blood in the finger
holes came from the victim.

00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:05,698
The blood in the head
was already dried

00:36:05,765 --> 00:36:08,234
by the time it was
tossed into the ball pit.

00:36:08,301 --> 00:36:09,468
Which means that
it couldn't have splashed

00:36:09,535 --> 00:36:10,636
or spilled in there.

00:36:10,703 --> 00:36:12,038
Right.

00:36:12,104 --> 00:36:14,073
So we've got the victim's
blood on Chevy's hands.

00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,841
I think it came
from his fingertips.

00:36:15,908 --> 00:36:17,510
And I think
that the smears were minute

00:36:17,577 --> 00:36:19,178
because he washed his hands.

00:36:19,245 --> 00:36:23,482
I think he accidentally left
blood under his nails, but...

00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:25,751
did Chevy ever actually
touch the bowling ball

00:36:25,818 --> 00:36:27,253
after he touched the head?

00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,222
No, so, at the very least, we
know that Chevy was involved.

00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:32,191
It's just so weird,
because you didn't find

00:36:32,258 --> 00:36:34,327
blood on any
of his personal effects.

00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:37,663
Not his shoes, clothes,
towel, gloves, just nothing.

00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,298
He had to have tossed
everything.

00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:41,267
I mean, clothes are replaceable.

00:36:41,334 --> 00:36:43,536
His lucky ball isn't.

00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:48,708
ANNOUNCER 2: Well, it's been
a crazy turn of events,

00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:51,344
but we're finally gonna find out
who wins this tournament.

00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,579
Final frame, final throw,
for the championship.

00:36:53,646 --> 00:36:56,182
Yeah, Chevy needs to
knock this field goal down

00:36:56,249 --> 00:36:57,483
for the win, J.T.

00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,753
If he misses, X-Man takes
his first against Chevy.

00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,921
Here we go.

00:37:01,988 --> 00:37:03,089
Look at the
determination.

00:37:03,155 --> 00:37:04,590
All comes down
to this, folks.

00:37:04,657 --> 00:37:05,825
He needs a miracle.

00:37:11,297 --> 00:37:13,232
Chevy, you're
under arrest.

00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:15,468
Drop the ball.

00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:17,036
Oh, this cannot be happening.
Come on.

00:37:17,103 --> 00:37:18,404
Get on your knees.

00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,048
(cheering)
Yes!

00:37:29,115 --> 00:37:30,650
(applause, cheering
and whistling)

00:37:30,716 --> 00:37:32,418
(sighs)

00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:35,087
You just lost.

00:37:35,154 --> 00:37:37,323
BRASS:
So did you.

00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:40,459
How's it feel to be ratted out
by your own bowling ball?

00:37:46,832 --> 00:37:48,868
What the hell am I still
doing here?

00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:50,670
I've told you everything I know.

00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:52,238
No, you didn't, but Chevy did.

00:37:52,305 --> 00:37:53,806
Sit.

00:37:53,873 --> 00:37:55,675
What did he tell you?

00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:58,811
That you killed Ronald,
decapitated him

00:37:58,878 --> 00:38:01,347
and threw his head
in the ball pit.

00:38:01,414 --> 00:38:02,615
That's what he said.

00:38:02,682 --> 00:38:03,783
No, he didn't.

00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:04,951
Shea,

00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:06,252
this is your life.

00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:07,820
Sit down.

00:38:07,887 --> 00:38:10,723
If Chevy's lying,
you need to tell me.

00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,291
Otherwise, he's going
to continue

00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:14,894
to win bowling titles
while you rot in a cell.

00:38:15,928 --> 00:38:18,497
Look, I didn't shoot Ronald.

00:38:18,564 --> 00:38:20,466
Then who did?

00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:24,904
When Ronny found out
about Chevy,

00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:26,973
he got a gun,

00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:29,842
and he forced me
to lure Chevy to SSB.

00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:32,345
He said he was just
trying to scare him,

00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:34,347
but I didn't know.

00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:36,816
I got completely freaked.

00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:39,218
<i>So, I just did what he wanted,</i>

00:38:39,285 --> 00:38:41,520
<i>and I told Chevy</i>
<i>that I was stranded.</i>

00:38:41,587 --> 00:38:44,190
Hey, bro, get out
of the truck.

00:38:44,257 --> 00:38:45,424
Get that gun out of my face.

00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:46,626
Get out of
the truck!
Ronny, don't!

00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:48,127
You're gonna get
out of the truck,

00:38:48,194 --> 00:38:49,862
I'm gonna call
your wife,

00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:51,998
and you're gonna tell her
what a scumbag you are,

00:38:52,064 --> 00:38:53,232
and how you been banging
my chick.

00:38:53,299 --> 00:38:54,500
SHEA:
Ronny, put the gun down.

00:38:54,567 --> 00:38:55,868
Shut up.
No.

00:38:55,935 --> 00:38:57,169
(crying):
Oh, my God!

00:38:57,236 --> 00:38:58,971
Oh, my God, Chevy!

00:38:59,038 --> 00:39:00,573
You set me up!

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,074
I ought to kill you, too!

00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:03,476
I'm sorry, Chevy.
I'm sorry.

00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:05,811
We got to get rid of this body.

00:39:05,878 --> 00:39:08,047
So, come on, pick him up.
Come on, come on, come on.

00:39:08,114 --> 00:39:09,248
(crying):
Okay, okay.

00:39:09,315 --> 00:39:12,051
Come on, lift higher.

00:39:12,118 --> 00:39:14,120
Come on, push!

00:39:15,288 --> 00:39:16,822
We're over.

00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:19,292
(gasping sob)

00:39:20,326 --> 00:39:22,828
Say a word, and
we both go down.

00:39:22,895 --> 00:39:24,730
(sobbing):
Oh, my God...

00:39:26,632 --> 00:39:29,735
Ronny promised me
that he was gonna marry me.

00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:31,837
15 years later,

00:39:31,904 --> 00:39:33,873
I still have the same last name.

00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,875
Chevy promised me
the same thing,

00:39:35,942 --> 00:39:38,511
just so he could
keep getting laid.

00:39:38,578 --> 00:39:41,247
I was just fed up.

00:39:43,983 --> 00:39:46,218
I wanted to give Chevy something

00:39:46,285 --> 00:39:48,321
that he would never forget.

00:39:51,924 --> 00:39:53,926
(sighs)

00:39:55,928 --> 00:39:57,563
(sudden squish)

00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,532
<i>It's shocking enough</i>

00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,135
<i>to find a human head</i>
<i>in the ball rack...</i>

00:40:05,671 --> 00:40:09,709
<i>...but when it's the head</i>
<i>of someone that you killed--</i>

00:40:09,775 --> 00:40:11,777
unforgettable.

00:40:19,852 --> 00:40:23,789
So, um,
what are we looking at here?

00:40:25,324 --> 00:40:26,926
Jail-time-wise? What...?

00:40:26,993 --> 00:40:28,261
What am I looking at?

00:40:28,327 --> 00:40:30,096
I mean, I didn't actually
kill anybody.

00:40:30,162 --> 00:40:32,131
No, but cutting the head off

00:40:32,198 --> 00:40:34,300
of your dead boyfriend
is not going

00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:36,903
to get you a lot of sympathy
from a jury.

00:40:36,969 --> 00:40:39,005
Right, yeah.

00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:41,207
But I mean,
I'll get out some day, right?

00:40:43,709 --> 00:40:46,145
And Chevy--
it was just self-defense.

00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:49,582
He could get out
even before I do.

00:40:49,649 --> 00:40:51,550
You might be right about that.

00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,389
By then, I mean,
he could have forgiven me.

00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:02,028
Maybe we'll get to be
together after all.

00:41:09,335 --> 00:41:10,703
MAN:
Ooh!

00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,004
(people groaning)

00:41:12,071 --> 00:41:14,640
I had it. I almost had it
and I hate this.

00:41:14,707 --> 00:41:15,808
I hate it.

00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:17,677
Happens every single time.

00:41:17,743 --> 00:41:18,878
No more.

00:41:18,945 --> 00:41:20,313
Aw, come on.
You know,

00:41:20,379 --> 00:41:22,782
don't be afraid to rock
the granny roll, Cath.

00:41:22,848 --> 00:41:24,850
Always works for me.

00:41:26,452 --> 00:41:27,553
Are you coming?

00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,854
The party's
already started.

00:41:28,921 --> 00:41:30,389
(over phone):
You better hurry.

00:41:30,456 --> 00:41:31,891
You're coming up soon.

00:41:31,958 --> 00:41:34,060
Yeah, Sara, I'm here, I'm here.

00:41:34,126 --> 00:41:35,294
I'm just getting my shoes.

00:41:35,361 --> 00:41:36,829
Size 13 and a half, please.

00:41:36,896 --> 00:41:38,764
Wait. Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on.

00:41:39,799 --> 00:41:40,800
HODGES: My granny
taught me that.

00:41:40,866 --> 00:41:41,867
Uh-huh...

00:41:43,236 --> 00:41:44,237
Langston's here,
everybody.

00:41:44,303 --> 00:41:46,339
Sara, that pin
is flipping you off.

00:41:48,241 --> 00:41:49,542
Nothing but
strikes, Doc!

00:41:51,077 --> 00:41:52,345
Nice hook.

00:41:52,411 --> 00:41:54,347
(everyone shouting
encouragement)

00:41:54,413 --> 00:41:57,183
(cheering and whistling)

00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,217
He's the sexiest.

00:41:58,284 --> 00:42:00,553
STOKES: There he is.
Time for a toast.

00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,721
Cold one?

00:42:01,787 --> 00:42:03,656
Yo, bowling
is a family sport.

00:42:03,723 --> 00:42:07,360
I would like to raise a glass
to our CSI family.

00:42:07,426 --> 00:42:08,761
STOKES:
Cheers.

00:42:08,828 --> 00:42:11,063
ALL:
Cheers! Yeah!

00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,332
Cheers.
Cheers.

00:42:13,399 --> 00:42:14,400
Cheers.

00:42:16,636 --> 00:42:18,271
But unfortunately,

00:42:18,337 --> 00:42:20,940
it's time to give the family
a little ass whooping.

00:42:21,007 --> 00:42:23,042
Ouch!
Oh, really!
All of us?

00:42:23,109 --> 00:42:24,543
Just pay attention, Nick.

00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,579
Be careful you don't let
your mouth write a check

00:42:26,646 --> 00:42:27,747
that your ass can't cash.

00:42:27,813 --> 00:42:29,448
(everyone laughing)
Ooh!

00:42:31,851 --> 00:42:34,186
Oh! Nice!

00:42:34,253 --> 00:42:35,655
(cheering, whooping,
applause)

00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:36,822
Wow. All right.

00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:38,324
WILLOWS:
Yeah!

00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:39,892
(laughs)
He's on my team.

00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:42,628
I told them 13 and a half.

00:42:42,695 --> 00:42:44,764
Wrong size.

00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,966
Be right back.
Hurry up.

00:42:47,033 --> 00:42:48,768
Hey, sorry I'm late.

00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:51,337
I couldn't find my ball.

00:42:51,404 --> 00:42:53,239
You have
a ball?
Yeah.

00:42:53,306 --> 00:42:54,373
And a bag.
It's a purse!

00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,541
(laughter)
Check it out!

00:42:55,608 --> 00:42:57,209
Did your grandmother
give you that bag?

00:42:57,276 --> 00:42:59,245
Time out. I thought
you weren't gonna bowl.

00:42:59,312 --> 00:43:00,546
Yeah, I changed my mind.

00:43:00,613 --> 00:43:02,949
Somebody's rearview mirror's
a little lighter.

00:43:03,015 --> 00:43:03,950
STOKES:
Is that legal?!

00:43:04,016 --> 00:43:06,352
Don't be scared.

00:43:11,857 --> 00:43:13,726
(cheering and applause)
I owe you nothing.

00:43:15,828 --> 00:43:17,763
Oh, all right,
it's on, it's on.

00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:20,800
All right... so what was that
about an ass whooping?
