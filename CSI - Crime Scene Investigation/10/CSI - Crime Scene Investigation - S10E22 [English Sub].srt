Brass said
the Dumpster diver

00:01:40,953 --> 00:01:44,022
that called it in hadn't been
down this way in a few days.

00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,395

Four-plus-one impressions

00:01:50,462 --> 00:01:52,765
Manual strangulation.

00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:54,800
There's also a thin abrasion.

00:01:54,867 --> 00:01:57,636
Killer swapped her necklace
for a choker?

00:01:57,703 --> 00:02:01,640
(gasps, choking)

00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:04,343
Where's the source
of that blood?

00:02:05,377 --> 00:02:08,981
It's a V-shaped wound.

00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:10,749
Doesn't look too deep.

00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,684
Maybe incidental
to the strangulation?

00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:15,487
Blood flow defies gravity.

00:02:23,929 --> 00:02:27,232
She bled in an upright position
and was moved after death.

00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:30,302
I think she might
have been dumped here.

00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:31,470
There is some

00:02:31,537 --> 00:02:33,172
yellow trace in the wound.

00:02:33,238 --> 00:02:35,674
I got a purse.

No cash.

00:02:59,031 --> 00:03:01,033

She a cop?
No badge or creds.

00:03:23,756 --> 00:03:26,325
So, what was her interest
in the Jekyll case?

00:03:26,391 --> 00:03:30,229

about something else, actually.

00:04:19,585 --> 00:04:21,520
Um, Heidi Custer.

00:04:21,587 --> 00:04:23,289
The woman found
in the alley?

00:04:23,355 --> 00:04:25,157
Yes.

00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:27,893
I knew her.

00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,296
Really?

00:04:30,362 --> 00:04:31,997
She was a reporter.

00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,400
She covered the Angel
of Death murders

00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:36,835
at Delaware General
while I was there.

00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,571
We spent quite a bit of
time talking back then.

00:04:39,638 --> 00:04:42,474
You talk to her
recently?
No, it's been years.

00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,109
But she was a
great reporter.

00:04:44,176 --> 00:04:45,778
Fierce, tenacious.

00:04:45,844 --> 00:04:47,146
Well, Brass reached her husband,

00:04:47,212 --> 00:04:49,715
who's also the editor
of the magazine she writes for.

00:04:49,782 --> 00:04:51,884
He's been in L.A. all week,
and confirmed

00:04:51,951 --> 00:04:54,153
that she was working on a story
about Jekyll.

00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:56,822
Do we know when she got
into town?
Monday.

00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:58,490
How much could she discover
in three days?

00:04:58,557 --> 00:04:59,592
Reporter like

00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:00,759
Heidi wouldn't have come

00:05:00,826 --> 00:05:02,294
out here without a good lead.

00:05:02,361 --> 00:05:04,330
It's possible that she turned up
something that we didn't.

00:05:04,396 --> 00:05:06,832
Well, Nick is heading to her
hotel room. You should join him.

00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:08,334
All right.

00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,449
No signs of a
struggle, no blood.

00:05:23,515 --> 00:05:25,451
This doesn't look
like the primary.

00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:28,187
And according to Heidi's
credit card records,

00:05:28,253 --> 00:05:30,356
she had a rented
Malibu, which is

00:05:30,422 --> 00:05:31,657
still M.I.A.

00:05:31,724 --> 00:05:33,859
Yeah.

00:05:38,564 --> 00:05:39,898
Where's her work?

00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:43,702
Where are her notes and...
her research?

00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:47,306
There's a camera charger here
and a laptop power cord.

00:05:47,373 --> 00:05:50,476
But she could have the camera
and the computer in her car.

00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:53,746
Right, or it could be in
the hands of her killer.
Yeah.

00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:58,417
Blue Aces Casino
Player's Club Card here.

00:05:58,484 --> 00:05:59,952
It's a locals only type place.

00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:01,220
I know.

00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:04,089
Jack Herson clocked
some credit card debt there.

00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:07,893
It's also along Joey Bigelow's
panhandling route.

00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,063
And why don't I remember
any of that?

00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,498
I've been following up

00:06:12,564 --> 00:06:15,034
on some of the Jekyll leads
in my spare time.

00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,502
Oh, you have?

00:06:16,568 --> 00:06:18,003
Yeah, I've been talking

00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,238
to victims' families
and friends.

00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:21,106
Trying to get a feel
for their habits.

00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:22,875
Trying to get a feel for Jekyll.

00:06:22,942 --> 00:06:24,810
Ray...

00:06:24,877 --> 00:06:28,881
this job will eat you alive
if you take it home with you.

00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:35,587
Okay, so, two victims
connected to the Jekyll case,

00:06:35,654 --> 00:06:37,990
and a reporter
who was investigating it

00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:40,059
all visited
the same little casino.

00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,894
If Heidi used that
player's card anywhere,

00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:43,896
we should be able
to find her on surveillance.

00:06:43,963 --> 00:06:45,965
Right.

00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:50,069
What about that?

00:06:50,135 --> 00:06:53,038
That looks exactly
like the letter L.

00:06:53,105 --> 00:06:56,075
Could be a message
from Jekyll. L for...

00:06:56,141 --> 00:06:58,677
David, those are two
surgical screws,

00:06:58,744 --> 00:07:00,212
implanted at a
90-degree angle

00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:03,549
as part of a knee
operation, documented

00:07:03,616 --> 00:07:04,883
in her medical records

00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,119
as having been performed
three years ago

00:07:07,186 --> 00:07:11,223
by a doctor whose name was
distinctly not Jekyll.

00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,893
Let it go.

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,729
Hey, David, Doc.

00:07:16,795 --> 00:07:18,197
What do we have?

00:07:18,264 --> 00:07:19,999
C.O.D.'s no surprise.

00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,635
Asphyxiation via manual
strangulation.

00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:24,436
Broken hyoid.

00:07:24,503 --> 00:07:27,640
Superficial
head wound clotted.

00:07:27,706 --> 00:07:29,775
Later reopened around
the time of death.

00:07:29,842 --> 00:07:31,176
As for the question
of whether

00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,312
she was a Jekyll victim--

00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:36,315
I performed a thorough
examination for puncture wounds,

00:07:36,382 --> 00:07:38,784
laparoscopic entry points,

00:07:38,851 --> 00:07:42,354
and despite David's imaginative
analysis...

00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,823
Greg, tell me that does not look
exactly like a smiley face.

00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,260
There was nothing
out of the ordinary.

00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:52,865
No unaccounted for objects
or organs inside her.

00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:54,133
So, Heidi Custer could be
another victim

00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:56,201
like Lily Xiaoping--

00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,904
a spur-of-the-moment,
unplanned kill

00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:00,839
by a cornered Jekyll

00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:03,642
who was simply trying
to avoid capture.

00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:07,980
Hey, Archie, I brought
you that blinky thing

00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:10,382
from the beepy
no-working thing

00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,518
you told me you'd
take a look at.

00:08:12,584 --> 00:08:14,119
Is that...?

00:08:14,186 --> 00:08:15,421
Yeah.

00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:17,122
Anything on the Blue Aces
surveillance, Archie?

00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:20,025
Actually, there is.

00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:22,027
(surveillance video rewinding)

00:08:22,094 --> 00:08:23,796
3:30 p.m. Monday.

00:08:23,862 --> 00:08:28,000
Heidi Custer goes
into the casino bar.

00:08:29,268 --> 00:08:30,903
Okay.

00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,372
30 seconds before that...

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,275
(video rewinding)

00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:41,580
WILLOWS:
Langston goes into the bar.

00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:44,650
There's no surveillance
inside the bar.

00:08:44,717 --> 00:08:46,318
But 20 minutes later,
Langston leaves.

00:08:46,385 --> 00:08:48,253
15 seconds
after that...

00:08:50,923 --> 00:08:52,091
Heidi leaves.

00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:55,361
Did he say anything about
meeting her for a drink?

00:08:57,863 --> 00:08:59,265
Thanks.

00:09:04,136 --> 00:09:06,672
MAN:
<i>Afghanistan, Liberia,</i>

00:09:06,739 --> 00:09:09,041
Iraq.

00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:11,010
Of all the places
she went for stories,

00:09:11,076 --> 00:09:15,381
I never-- I never thought Vegas
would be the one that got her.

00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:18,684
You see this mark
around her neck?

00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:20,552
Did your wife
wear a necklace?

00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:22,988
(gags)

00:09:23,055 --> 00:09:25,124
Amber pendant.

00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,127
Well, gift
from a Congolese rebel.

00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,931
I was never able to get her
to wear her wedding ring, but...

00:09:31,997 --> 00:09:35,401
she never took
that damn thing off.

00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:38,637
I always knew I came
second to her work.

00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:42,441
But she was worth it.

00:09:44,343 --> 00:09:47,746
Yeah, I heard she was
a hell of a reporter.

00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:51,917
A colleague of
mine knew her.

00:09:51,984 --> 00:09:54,320
Ray Langston.

00:09:55,821 --> 00:09:58,824
Ray Langston's a cop?

00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:01,460
No, he's a CSI.

00:10:01,527 --> 00:10:04,763
Ray Langston is a murderer.

00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,493
About five years ago,
my wife was writing a piece

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,542
on the Angel of Death
at Delaware General Hospital.

00:10:17,608 --> 00:10:20,445
27 patients were murdered by
injection of ethylene glycol

00:10:20,511 --> 00:10:22,113
into their IVs.

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,351
Langston was a pathologist
at the hospital...

00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,286
and a very helpful source
to Heidi.

00:10:28,353 --> 00:10:30,688
At first.

00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,625
HEIDI:
<i>If the tragedy</i>
<i>at Delaware General</i>

00:10:33,691 --> 00:10:36,761
<i>is ever granted the full</i>
<i>autopsy it deserves,</i>

00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:38,730
<i>a haunting truth will</i>
<i>be revealed</i>

00:10:38,796 --> 00:10:40,565

00:10:40,632 --> 00:10:42,133

<i>the same way</i>
<i>he killed his patients,</i>

00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:48,206
<i>the police and hospital</i>
<i>quickly closed the case.</i>

00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,807
<i>Even though there was</i>
<i>compelling evidence</i>

00:10:49,874 --> 00:10:52,010

<i>act alone. </i>

00:10:53,878 --> 00:10:57,348
<i>Death by ethylene glycol</i>
<i>does not arrive unheralded.</i>

00:10:57,415 --> 00:10:59,684
<i>Distinct crystals</i>
<i>of calcium oxalate</i>

00:10:59,751 --> 00:11:02,253
<i>accumulate in the tubules</i>
<i>of the kidney.</i>

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,323
<i>And yet, with the evidence</i>
<i>of Dr. Webb's murders</i>

00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,492
<i>literally glittering</i>
<i>before him,</i>

00:11:07,558 --> 00:11:10,828
<i>Delaware General's pathologist,</i>

00:11:10,895 --> 00:11:12,463

00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,831
<i>nothing unusual.</i>

00:11:13,898 --> 00:11:17,335
<i>27 times over, he saw nothing</i>

00:11:17,402 --> 00:11:21,839
<i>and allowed Dr. Webb's</i>
<i>sinister work to continue.</i>

00:11:21,906 --> 00:11:23,941
Well, I talked
to CSI Langston.

00:11:24,008 --> 00:11:26,511
He had nothing but admiration
for your wife.

00:11:26,577 --> 00:11:28,546
He never mentioned
her article.

00:11:28,613 --> 00:11:30,348
That's because
we never published it.

00:11:30,415 --> 00:11:32,717
It never passed
the fact-checking process.

00:11:32,784 --> 00:11:34,152
So, her accusations
were false?

00:11:34,218 --> 00:11:35,253
I didn't say that.

00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,288
We kill stories
all the time...

00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:40,391
because reporters rely
too heavily on unnamed sources.

00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,026
And the only reason
that this story got spiked

00:11:42,093 --> 00:11:43,828
was because a bunch of lawyers
were too afraid

00:11:43,895 --> 00:11:47,565
the magazine was
gonna get sued.

00:11:47,632 --> 00:11:49,067
But my wife was right.

00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:50,568
He helped Dr. Webb,

00:11:50,635 --> 00:11:52,704
and now he's helping
Dr. Jekyll.

00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:56,874
CSI Langston has been relentless
in his pursuit of Dr. Jekyll.

00:11:56,941 --> 00:12:01,112
<i>He was personally assaulted</i>
<i>by the suspect.</i>

00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,480
(groans)

00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,918
AARON:
<i>And you saw this happen?</i>

00:12:06,985 --> 00:12:08,353
The gash in his head--
that told the story.

00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:09,354
Giving himself

00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,022
a bump on the head--

00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:13,424
nice touch
of authenticity.

00:12:13,491 --> 00:12:17,762
Raymond Langston hid
behind a lab coat,

00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:19,831
and now he's hiding
behind a badge.

00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,303
HODGES:
It's a lovely shade
of saffron, no?

00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:31,275
Just got my annual
trace metals report.

00:12:31,342 --> 00:12:35,213
Hmm, my mercury is as high
as the Baker thermometer.

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,215
Guess I should lay
off that tuna sushi.

00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:39,951
Otherwise, I'm facing
chelation therapy.

00:12:40,018 --> 00:12:42,654
The trace we found
in Heidi Custer's head wound

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,222
was lead paint.

00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:47,258
My lead levels are well
within the normal range.

00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:50,461
The weapon could have
been any tool or implement

00:12:50,528 --> 00:12:51,729
with a 90-degree angle

00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:54,232
and old enough
to have lead paint.

00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:56,768
Or a super fun new toy
from China.

00:12:56,834 --> 00:12:58,069
Ray.

00:12:58,136 --> 00:12:59,203
Yes.

00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,238
My office.

00:13:00,305 --> 00:13:01,506
Right.

00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,479
She came at me in disguise,
Catherine.

00:13:08,546 --> 00:13:09,914
She pretended
to value my insights,

00:13:09,981 --> 00:13:11,883
and the whole time
Heidi was investigating me.

00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:12,950
Ray...

00:13:13,017 --> 00:13:14,919
This article of hers
is full of junk science.

00:13:14,986 --> 00:13:16,621
That's not the issue
here.

00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:21,426
I examined samples that
I received from other doctors.

00:13:21,492 --> 00:13:23,161
Dr. Webb wasn't just
going to send me

00:13:23,227 --> 00:13:25,029
evidence of his murders,

00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,264
and when his mortality rates
became suspicious,

00:13:26,331 --> 00:13:27,799
I was the one
that bucked protocol.

00:13:27,865 --> 00:13:30,468
I started autopsying
the bodies myself.

00:13:30,535 --> 00:13:32,270
We're not here about the article

00:13:32,337 --> 00:13:33,571
or your feelings, Ray.

00:13:33,638 --> 00:13:36,674
You met with a homicide victim
shortly before she died.

00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:38,109
What are you talking about?
And then withheld

00:13:38,176 --> 00:13:39,410
that information

00:13:39,477 --> 00:13:40,945
from your supervisor.

00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:49,320
I was at the Blue Aces,
but I was there on my own time,

00:13:49,387 --> 00:13:51,089
and I swear,
Catherine,

00:13:51,155 --> 00:13:52,957
I never saw her there.

00:13:56,928 --> 00:13:59,731
Conrad... you know what
a casino floor is like.

00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,368
It's a maze of slot
machines and gaming tables.

00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:04,769
(scoffs)

00:14:04,836 --> 00:14:08,272
You know, I admire you guys for
sticking together, I really do.

00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:12,510
I'm not saying I don't believe
you, Ray-- I'm struggling to--

00:14:12,577 --> 00:14:13,945
but when we catch
Heidi's killer,

00:14:14,012 --> 00:14:15,813
12 members of a jury
aren't going to be

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,715
as understanding as Catherine
when it comes

00:14:17,782 --> 00:14:18,950
to coincidence.

00:14:19,017 --> 00:14:21,219
They're just going to
see an over-involved CSI

00:14:21,285 --> 00:14:23,254
who had a conflict
of interest.

00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,823
So... it's hands off.

00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,892
You can't work this one.

00:14:29,761 --> 00:14:33,498
(computer beeping)

00:14:52,884 --> 00:14:54,986
(typing)

00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,630
Ray,

00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,265
Catherine just told me
what happened with Ecklie.

00:15:07,332 --> 00:15:08,866
What are you doing
in here?

00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:09,901
Take a look at this.

00:15:09,968 --> 00:15:11,169
Heidi Custer

00:15:11,235 --> 00:15:14,072
used her credit card at the
Blue Aces when I was there.

00:15:14,138 --> 00:15:17,141
Then she used it again
to park at WLVU

00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,309
Medical School.

00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:21,612
I was there--
same place, same time.

00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:23,314
Heidi Custer
was following me.

00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,482
Why would she do
something like that?

00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,817
Because she thought
I was connected

00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,185
to the Jekyll murders.

00:15:27,251 --> 00:15:29,821
I'm investigating Jekyll,
she's investigating me.

00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,556
All right, all right,
if anybody asks, though,

00:15:31,623 --> 00:15:33,024
I found this,
you didn't.

00:15:33,091 --> 00:15:35,093
Now, you got to get out
of here-- I think you're up next

00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,461
for call-outs.
I may have led her to Jekyll.

00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:37,695
I may have gotten her killed.

00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:38,763
You don't know that.

00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,931
I was going to
all the places

00:15:39,998 --> 00:15:41,733
that Jekyll's
victims went to,

00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:43,835
places that Jekyll may
have gone to himself.

00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,304
Heidi was there
asking questions about Jekyll,

00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:48,439
She asked the wrong person
the wrong question.

00:15:48,506 --> 00:15:51,476
I need to go out there.
I need to retrace my steps.

00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:53,378
No, no, we'll go back out,
as a team.

00:15:53,444 --> 00:15:55,480
You need to stay off this case
and trust us.

00:15:55,546 --> 00:15:57,315
We'll handle it.

00:15:57,382 --> 00:15:59,951
I'm going to get you my notes.

00:16:00,018 --> 00:16:01,853
All right.

00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,692
He's off the Heidi Custer case.

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,427
I want to tell you something,

00:16:09,494 --> 00:16:11,396
but you cannot tell
anybody else.

00:16:11,462 --> 00:16:13,031
You know me.

00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,166
Okay, this time I swear.

00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:16,668
I promise.

00:16:16,734 --> 00:16:18,970
Do you remember
the Botanica case?

00:16:19,037 --> 00:16:23,141
<i>Langston had palpated some</i>
<i>grout with his bare hands.</i>

00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:24,909
So I asked him for
a control DNA sample

00:16:24,976 --> 00:16:26,344
because I wanted
to exclude him, right?

00:16:26,411 --> 00:16:28,079
Well, in that case, I just need
a sample of your DNA

00:16:28,146 --> 00:16:29,580
and I will exclude you.

00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:32,250
You're going to have to put
in your report that I said no.

00:16:32,317 --> 00:16:33,818
<i>He refused.</i>

00:16:33,885 --> 00:16:37,288
Well, after seeing <i>Gattaca,</i>
you can't hardly blame him.

00:16:37,355 --> 00:16:39,390
We all have privacy issues.

00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:40,858
Okay, that's a valid point,

00:16:40,925 --> 00:16:42,894
but a couple months before that,

00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,228
he was in the break room,

00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,964
and he was reading somebody's
genetic report

00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,265
about M.A.O.A. deficiency.

00:16:47,332 --> 00:16:48,666
You know, that specific
mutation right there

00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:50,335
has actually been linked
to violent behavior.

00:16:50,401 --> 00:16:53,571
M.A.O.A. deficiency
doesn't make you violent.

00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,707
Just 'cause something might
happen, doesn't mean it will.

00:16:55,773 --> 00:16:57,508
It's genetics,
it's not destiny.

00:16:57,575 --> 00:17:00,445
HODGES:
<i>I see your need</i>
<i>for the cone of silence.</i>

00:17:00,511 --> 00:17:04,449
First his hospital, his
classroom and now here.

00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:07,752
The man does seem to be a magnet
for serial killers.

00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,922
I understand not wanting
to share the details

00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:12,890
of your personal life
with your coworkers.

00:17:12,957 --> 00:17:14,692
But when you don't share
the fruits

00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,160
of your investigative work...

00:17:16,227 --> 00:17:17,562
No, he will
from now on.

00:17:17,629 --> 00:17:19,263
He wasn't purposely
shutting us out.

00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,065
Look, I really like Ray.

00:17:21,132 --> 00:17:24,702
I think he's a great CSI.

00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:27,271
But if he doesn't trust us,
how can we have his back?

00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,706
And how can he have ours?

00:17:28,773 --> 00:17:32,810
Hey, Heidi Custer used her
credit card Wednesday night

00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:34,545
at 7:05 p.m. to get gas.

00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:36,581
I called the station.

00:17:36,648 --> 00:17:38,883
I got a surveillance photo
of her at the pump.

00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:42,053
Now, that narrows down time
of death to Wednesday night.

00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,755
It does something
else, too.

00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:46,424
It gives Langston an alibi
for Heidi's murder.

00:17:46,491 --> 00:17:48,793
At 7:05 p.m.,
he was already at work.

00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,295
Solo burglary.

00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,163
He was gone a couple of hours.

00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:58,670
Well, it's easy enough to
confirm he was there, right?

00:18:07,345 --> 00:18:09,414
Crime scene photos
are all time coded.

00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,149
7:20.

00:18:12,984 --> 00:18:14,919
7:20.

00:18:14,986 --> 00:18:16,354
24.

00:18:16,421 --> 00:18:20,258
7:32... and the last one's

00:18:20,325 --> 00:18:21,426
at 7:40.

00:18:21,492 --> 00:18:23,194
So, he obviously
photoed first.

00:18:23,261 --> 00:18:26,230
Three latent prints
in two hours?

00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,134
That's all he collected?

00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:34,572
What else was Langston doing?

00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,250
OFFICER:
Parking control spotted
Heidi Custer's vehicle.

00:18:39,316 --> 00:18:40,951
SANDERS:
Let's start a canvass.

00:18:41,018 --> 00:18:44,989
See if anybody recognizes her
or saw who parked the car.

00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:46,824
Will do.
SIDLE: Thanks.

00:18:51,796 --> 00:18:53,731
Well, she wouldn't have
walked away

00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:55,299
and left the keys
in the ignition.

00:18:58,903 --> 00:19:00,871
No laptop, no camera.

00:19:00,938 --> 00:19:02,940
Nothing in here either.

00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:05,876
So, the killer dumps Heidi
in the alley

00:19:05,943 --> 00:19:07,044
a couple miles away,

00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:09,046
drives over here

00:19:09,113 --> 00:19:11,348
and walks away with
the camera and the laptop.

00:19:11,415 --> 00:19:12,717
A private lot
like this

00:19:12,783 --> 00:19:16,320
is rarely patrolled
by police or parking control.

00:19:16,387 --> 00:19:19,123
Dumping the car here
indicates the perp

00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,258
may have some knowledge
of law enforcement.

00:19:21,325 --> 00:19:25,296
Well, if they were banking on us
not finding the car,

00:19:25,363 --> 00:19:26,831
maybe there's something
inside it.

00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,724
(camera shutter clicking)

00:19:58,996 --> 00:20:00,865
Bloody print
on the steering wheel.

00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:07,505
SANDERS:
More blood over here.

00:20:32,463 --> 00:20:36,033
LANGSTON:
<i>I was going to all the places</i>
<i>that Jekyll's victims went to.</i>

00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,768
<i>Places that Jekyll may</i>
<i>have gone to himself.</i>

00:20:37,835 --> 00:20:40,371
<i>I need to go out there.</i>
<i>I need to retrace my steps.</i>

00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:43,040
STOKES:
<i>You need to stay off this case</i>
<i>and trust us.</i>

00:20:43,107 --> 00:20:45,976
LANGSTON:
<i>I may have led her to Jekyll.</i>
<i>I may have gotten her killed.</i>

00:20:46,043 --> 00:20:48,279
(tires screeching)

00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:10,668
Hello. My name's Ray Langston.

00:21:10,735 --> 00:21:12,236
I'm with the Vegas Crime Lab.

00:21:12,303 --> 00:21:13,838
I came in here the other day

00:21:13,904 --> 00:21:15,706
and showed you
some pictures.
You remember?

00:21:15,773 --> 00:21:17,508
Oh, yeah, I remember.

00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:20,044
Um, I have one more
photograph to show you.

00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:21,679
Do you recognize this woman?

00:21:21,746 --> 00:21:24,014
No. I don't make eye contact
with the customers.

00:21:24,081 --> 00:21:25,349
It only encourages
them to yell.

00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,485
I'm trying to find out
if she came in here

00:21:27,551 --> 00:21:28,986
shortly after I did
the other day.

00:21:29,053 --> 00:21:30,354
Maybe she spoke
with someone else?

00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:31,956
Uh, a white male,

00:21:32,022 --> 00:21:33,457
average build?

00:21:33,524 --> 00:21:35,860
I've never seen her.
But I know we got surveillance,

00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:37,895
'cause the night shift
gets robbed all the time.

00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:39,530
All right, I'll, uh,

00:21:39,597 --> 00:21:41,499
come back with a warrant.
Thank you.

00:22:04,355 --> 00:22:05,423
You son of a bitch,

00:22:05,489 --> 00:22:06,991
you killed my wife!

00:22:07,058 --> 00:22:09,894
You killed my wife,
you son of a bitch!

00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,064
(sobbing):
You son... you killed my wife!

00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,133
AARON:
<i>You just, you're gonna</i>
<i>let him go?</i>

00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,301
Just let him walk away?

00:22:17,368 --> 00:22:18,636
This guy's a murderer!

00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:19,970
I'm telling you
he's a murderer!

00:22:20,037 --> 00:22:21,605
LANGSTON:
He blindsided me,
Catherine

00:22:21,672 --> 00:22:22,773
Yeah, I know
the feeling.

00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,041
What are you
doing here?

00:22:24,108 --> 00:22:25,142
I was on my way

00:22:25,209 --> 00:22:26,644
to a 406 on Riviera.

00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:29,246
And you decided to
stop for a soda and

00:22:29,313 --> 00:22:31,148
the Jekyll Killer
special, is that it?

00:22:31,215 --> 00:22:32,683
Ray, you got to quit

00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,285
playing detective,
you know?

00:22:34,351 --> 00:22:37,188
'Cause I don't have
time to keep getting
your ass out of jams

00:22:37,254 --> 00:22:39,090
that you shouldn't be in
in the first place.

00:22:39,156 --> 00:22:40,191
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:22:40,257 --> 00:22:42,360
So this is why
it took you two hours

00:22:42,426 --> 00:22:44,128
to lift three points
at your last 406?

00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:45,863
You're running your
own investigation.

00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,865
Catherine, listen...
Right. It's a lot

00:22:47,932 --> 00:22:49,133
harder to blindside a guy

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,202
if he follows the playbook
and trusts his team.

00:22:51,268 --> 00:22:53,938
I was honestly on my way
to my scene. I passed...

00:22:54,004 --> 00:22:55,706
You're not going to your scene
anymore. You're going home.

00:22:55,773 --> 00:22:57,141
You're suspending me?

00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,309
No, I'm diagnosing you.

00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,443
You got the whatever virus.

00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,078
Take a sick day.

00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:33,344
(knocking)

00:23:50,027 --> 00:23:51,228
Hey.

00:23:51,295 --> 00:23:52,830
Hey.

00:23:52,897 --> 00:23:55,332
Come on in.

00:23:57,668 --> 00:24:02,406
Catherine send you
to take my temperature?

00:24:02,473 --> 00:24:04,675
No. No,
I'm not a doctor.

00:24:04,742 --> 00:24:06,043
Maybe if I was,

00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,679
I could decipher your
chicken-scratch handwriting.

00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:09,947
(dry chuckle)

00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:13,284
Nice place.

00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,819
Thank you.

00:24:14,885 --> 00:24:17,054
Single-malt.

00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:18,723
Boy, that's good stuff.

00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:21,225
Dr. Robbins brought it by
last week.

00:24:21,292 --> 00:24:23,394
Care for a snort?

00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:24,829
I'm, I'm good.

00:24:24,895 --> 00:24:26,564
Sure?

00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,065
Good stuff.

00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:29,934
I'm sure it is.

00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:33,437
(sighs)

00:24:33,504 --> 00:24:34,905
We can work back there.

00:24:34,972 --> 00:24:36,640
All right.

00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:06,037
You've been, uh, <i>busy,</i> huh?

00:25:07,471 --> 00:25:09,073
Just a little bit.

00:25:23,721 --> 00:25:26,424
What, uh, what happened
over here?

00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:29,627
Those are leads
I decided to eliminate;

00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,829
crackpot theories mostly.

00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:34,265
Tinfoil-hat ramblings,

00:25:34,331 --> 00:25:35,833
some of which
are not even my own.

00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,001
You know how it is, Nick.

00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:38,569
You listen to any piece
of music long enough,

00:25:38,636 --> 00:25:41,338
it starts to sound good.

00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,276
We found
Heidi's rental car.

00:25:45,342 --> 00:25:48,279
Unknown fingerprint
on the steering wheel.

00:25:48,345 --> 00:25:52,049
Heidi's blood on the interior
of the passenger-side door.

00:25:52,116 --> 00:25:55,186
The car went off the road
at some point.

00:25:58,022 --> 00:25:59,457
Did you have any places

00:25:59,523 --> 00:26:01,092
of interest out
in the desert,

00:26:01,158 --> 00:26:03,728
off the beaten path?

00:26:03,794 --> 00:26:06,964
Sure. A dump where Jack Herson
used to salvage scrap metal,

00:26:07,031 --> 00:26:10,368
an airstrip where Bernard
Higgins used to charter jets.

00:26:10,434 --> 00:26:11,736
Half a dozen
other places,

00:26:11,802 --> 00:26:14,572
You think she could have
homed in on some of your leads

00:26:14,638 --> 00:26:16,540
going out here
on her own?

00:26:16,607 --> 00:26:17,942
I didn't go out

00:26:18,008 --> 00:26:20,244
to any of those places while
she was following me, but...

00:26:20,311 --> 00:26:23,147
sure, I suppose it's possible.

00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,551
Ecklie's not gonna like us
running around

00:26:27,618 --> 00:26:28,886
all over the place.

00:26:28,953 --> 00:26:31,255
Us?

00:26:31,322 --> 00:26:32,757
Yeah, man,

00:26:32,823 --> 00:26:35,159
we're a team. Come on.

00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:41,632
Okay?

00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,002
Now, who's this

00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:46,737
on the back wall
over here?

00:26:49,173 --> 00:26:52,043
Ah... yes.

00:26:52,109 --> 00:26:55,546
My family.

00:26:56,747 --> 00:26:58,449
The great mystery: my father.

00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:01,385
A man
with a very violent temper.

00:27:01,452 --> 00:27:05,489
I sometimes wonder if my
affinity for Chicago blues

00:27:05,556 --> 00:27:08,893
isn't the only thing
that I inherited from him.

00:27:10,761 --> 00:27:14,999
You know, I think everybody
has a violent streak in 'em.

00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,434
I know I do.

00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,003
But it's how we deal with it

00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,905
that determines who we are
as men.

00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,409
(knocking)

00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:29,647
We brought soup,
bagels...

00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,048
And bat feces.

00:27:31,115 --> 00:27:32,650
I'd prefer cream cheese.

00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:33,984
Come on in.

00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:36,887
SANDERS:
Hodges analyzed
the trace recovered

00:27:36,954 --> 00:27:38,956
from the Malibu's
tires-- bat guano.

00:27:39,023 --> 00:27:41,225
And based on

00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,893
the insect matter,

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,063
the little morsels were the
work of the free-tailed bat.

00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,598
Considering the large amount
of the sample,

00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,867
the car must've been driven
near a bat roosting spot.

00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:51,869
Mines, caves.

00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,939
There are a lot of those
around Clark County.

00:27:55,005 --> 00:27:57,708
But we can eliminate
most of them.

00:27:57,775 --> 00:27:59,110
The Malibu's tires were clean

00:27:59,176 --> 00:28:01,645
when Heidi filled up
at 7:05 p.m.

00:28:01,712 --> 00:28:03,481
She started
with a full tank of gas.

00:28:03,547 --> 00:28:06,384
Malibus can get, you know,
up to 34 miles to the gallon.

00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:09,887
We found the car with a half
a gallon consumed, which means

00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:12,857
she drove up to 17 miles
after she filled up.

00:28:12,923 --> 00:28:15,426
Maximum 8.5 miles out,
8.5 miles back.

00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:16,560
There are only

00:28:16,627 --> 00:28:19,196
a handful of caves and mines
within 8.5 miles

00:28:19,263 --> 00:28:20,498
of that gas station.

00:28:20,564 --> 00:28:23,401
We marked them here.

00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:25,669
LANGSTON:
Huh, Lobo Flats.

00:28:25,736 --> 00:28:27,605
STOKES:
Were you out there?
Mm-hmm.

00:28:27,671 --> 00:28:28,606
What was the lead?

00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:30,007
A fairy tale.

00:28:30,074 --> 00:28:32,777
That's why I tore it down.

00:28:32,843 --> 00:28:34,145
A couple of weeks ago,

00:28:34,211 --> 00:28:36,247
I was out at WLVU
Medical School.

00:28:36,313 --> 00:28:40,084
<i>A man approached me, a coffee</i>
<i>server named Vince Grady.</i>

00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,585
<i>Badge lover.</i>

00:28:41,652 --> 00:28:45,056
<i>He said he was interested</i>
<i>in what I was working on.</i>

00:28:45,122 --> 00:28:47,324
Dr. Langston?

00:28:47,391 --> 00:28:50,761
You're still investigating
the Dr. Jekyll case, right?

00:28:50,828 --> 00:28:51,829
Yes.

00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:55,766
I saw something this weekend.

00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:58,035
Why don't you
have a seat.

00:29:00,604 --> 00:29:04,175
I was out near Lobo Flats
looking for arrowheads.

00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:07,978
<i>Valuable stuff out there</i>
<i>if you've got the eyes for it.</i>

00:29:08,045 --> 00:29:09,380
<i>That's where I saw him.</i>

00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,315
<i>There was blood</i>
<i>all over his scrubs.</i>

00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:13,551
<i>So I went out there with Vince.</i>

00:29:13,617 --> 00:29:16,420
<i>At first, I thought,</i>
<i>"Why would he be way out here?"</i>

00:29:16,487 --> 00:29:19,356
<i>But if you think about it,</i>
<i>it's the perfect place.</i>

00:29:19,423 --> 00:29:21,592
<i>Nobody could hear</i>
<i>his victims scream.</i>

00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,628
<i>Who knows how many victims</i>
<i>he's chalked up by this point.</i>

00:29:24,695 --> 00:29:27,898
<i>Could have bodies buried</i>
<i>all around here.</i>

00:29:27,965 --> 00:29:29,500
<i>Might consider bringing out</i>
<i>some cadaver dogs</i>

00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,702
<i>or ground-penetrating radar.</i>

00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:33,137
LANGSTON:
<i>Place wasn't even locked.</i>

00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:36,874
<i>Hardly the fastidious work</i>
<i>of a killer like Jekyll.</i>

00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,476
<i>And what I found inside</i>

00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:40,144
<i>did nothing</i>
<i>to assuage those doubts.</i>

00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,179
He's good.

00:29:42,246 --> 00:29:43,714
Not a drop of
blood anywhere.

00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:45,049
The guy's a genius.

00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,717
I'll be sure to integrate
this lead

00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:48,285
into our
investigation.

00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:55,159
Is this the place?

00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:57,294
LANGSTON:
Yes.

00:29:57,361 --> 00:29:59,296
(sirens wailing)

00:29:59,363 --> 00:30:00,698
(sirens stop)

00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:16,680
OFFICER:
It's all clear.

00:30:16,747 --> 00:30:18,883
All right, Ray, I'm heading in.

00:30:18,949 --> 00:30:20,818
Copy that.

00:31:14,338 --> 00:31:17,308
I got a stain on the floor
in here.

00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,777
Blood?

00:31:25,983 --> 00:31:28,719
LANGSTON:
Nick, you there?

00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,588
Nick, you there?

00:31:30,654 --> 00:31:32,323
Nick, you there?!

00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,458
Yeah.

00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:36,894
Yeah, and so was someone else.

00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:58,542
Got a toolbox here.

00:32:01,255 --> 00:32:05,059
Yellow paint like we found
in Heidi's head wound.

00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:07,719
And some of the paint's
been knocked

00:32:07,786 --> 00:32:09,221
off one of the corners.

00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,192
(screaming and yelling)

00:32:14,259 --> 00:32:16,094
(toolbox clattering)

00:32:19,131 --> 00:32:23,001
I may even have
a partial palm print.

00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,038
(computer trilling)

00:32:26,104 --> 00:32:27,639
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:32:27,706 --> 00:32:31,417
The bloody fingerprints from
the fridge are Heidi Custer's.

00:32:31,484 --> 00:32:35,788
LANGSTON (over phone):
Well, what about the palm print
from the toolbox?

00:32:35,855 --> 00:32:37,456
STOKES:
Running it right now.

00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:39,325
(typing)

00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:41,193
(computer trilling)

00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:43,162
No match.

00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:45,664
And no way to tell if it's
from the same contributor

00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:46,732
as the bloody fingerprint

00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,467
from the steering wheel
in Heidi's car.

00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:52,338
That means Heidi was in
the building and alive

00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:55,107
at least long enough
to have left her prints.

00:32:55,174 --> 00:32:57,176
Ray,

00:32:57,243 --> 00:32:59,145
if you haven't been back out 
to this place

00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:01,680
since she came to town,
how did she learn about it?

00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:05,718
Perhaps from the same person
who led me out there.

00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:07,786
(grunting)

00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:10,956
Happy to aid you
with the Jekyll investigation.

00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:15,427
Has Dr. Langston
been following up on my lead?

00:33:17,062 --> 00:33:19,965
Mr. Grady,

00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:22,401
you recognize her?

00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:25,437
Yes, ma'am.

00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:28,674
She-she's dead?

00:33:28,741 --> 00:33:30,676
Mm-hmm.

00:33:30,743 --> 00:33:32,278
(sighs)

00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,980
Nev-never should have taken her
out there.

00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:39,852
<i>She said that she had seen me</i>
<i>talking to Dr. Langston.</i>

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,355
Gave him a big lead
in the Dr. Jekyll investigation.

00:33:43,422 --> 00:33:44,723
It was integrated.

00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,192
Oh.

00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:48,060
What was the lead?

00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:49,762
Well, that's
police business.

00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:52,565
Really don't want
to compromise the investigation.

00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:55,267
Sure. Um, well, I'm
working on a story

00:33:55,334 --> 00:33:57,570
for a big national
news magazine.

00:33:57,636 --> 00:33:59,905
Think a $100 latte

00:33:59,972 --> 00:34:01,707
might be the fix I need?

00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:05,744
GRADY:
Hey, Lou, cover for me.

00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:10,850
The key with a
killer like Jekyll

00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:13,319
is to put yourself into
his twisted mindset.

00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:14,987
It's a chess game, really.

00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:17,590
Every move Jekyll
makes is calculated,

00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:19,725
and guys like
Langston and I

00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:22,528
have to anticipate
his deadly gambits.

00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:27,066
Location like this fits
my profile of Jekyll.

00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:29,502
I'm thinking there may
be a secret passageway

00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:32,104
to an underground
operating room.

00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:34,440
(gasps)
Ow.
Geez!

00:34:34,507 --> 00:34:37,209
WILLOWS:
<i>Toolbox just happened</i>
<i>to fall on her head?</i>

00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:39,478
GRADY:
<i>That's what happened. I swear.</i>

00:34:39,545 --> 00:34:43,749
So, tell me more about
the secret passageway theory.

00:34:43,816 --> 00:34:46,085
WILLOWS:
<i>I'm not buying it, Mr. Grady.</i>

00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:48,454
And I don't think Heidi was,
either.

00:34:48,521 --> 00:34:51,023
I think Heidi realized
that there was nothing

00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,792
in that building but a story
and a pathetic little man

00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:55,461
who had spun it
for some attention.

00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:59,064
She called you out on it--
she humiliated you--

00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:01,100
so you attacked her.

00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:03,469
You smashed her head
into that toolbox,

00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:05,070
grabbed her by the throat...

00:35:05,137 --> 00:35:06,472
No.

00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:09,441
No. No.

00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:11,577
Uh, no, no, no, no, no.

00:35:11,644 --> 00:35:14,947
Okay, yeah,
maybe she wasn't thrilled

00:35:15,014 --> 00:35:17,917
about the head wound
and some of my theories,

00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:19,785
but I certainly
did not touch her.

00:35:19,852 --> 00:35:22,021
She gave me a ride
back to the medical school.

00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:23,756
She was alive
when she dropped me off.

00:35:23,823 --> 00:35:27,159
And I was not lying.

00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:31,497
We never should
have breached Jekyll's lair.

00:35:31,564 --> 00:35:33,666
But we did--
he tasted her blood,

00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:36,502
he hunted her down,
and he finished her.

00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:38,504
Where's Dr. Langston?

00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:40,873
Excuse me?
I need to speak to Dr. Langston.

00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,041
He understands the kind
of criminal mastermind

00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:43,042
that we're after.

00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:45,177
(knocking on glass)

00:35:53,953 --> 00:35:57,189
The palm print
on the toolbox is Vince's,

00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:59,792
but the bloody print
on Heidi's steering wheel

00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:01,794
is definitely not.

00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:03,295
Still unknown.

00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:06,265
Well, it's consistent
with the goofball's story.

00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:09,835
Guy's delusional,
but I don't think he killed her.

00:36:09,902 --> 00:36:11,637
And we don't have
any other suspects.

00:36:11,704 --> 00:36:13,439
But we do have another theory.

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,142
Langston's.

00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:18,878
STOKES:
If Langston was right
and he led Heidi to Jekyll,

00:36:18,944 --> 00:36:20,546
we might find him
somewhere

00:36:20,613 --> 00:36:22,882
in this Blue Aces
surveillance footage.

00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:25,151
JOHNSON:
Well, I've looked
through it all.

00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:27,586
She didn't talk to anybody.

00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:30,322
She just follows Langston
through the casino,

00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:32,558
into the bar,
and then out again.

00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:34,226
Besides, aside
from a guy

00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:36,262
playing keno in
his bloody scrubs,

00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:38,731
how are we even going to be able
to identify Jekyll?

00:36:38,798 --> 00:36:41,767
Some random
five-foot-ten white dude?

00:36:41,834 --> 00:36:43,502
Check out this guy.

00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:46,705
He's playing a penny machine
near Langston and Heidi,

00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:49,775
but when they were on
the other side of the casino...

00:36:51,076 --> 00:36:53,412
...the same guy is playing
ten dollar slots,

00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:55,714
and again right by
the two of them.

00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:57,416
Now, nobody who plays pennies

00:36:57,483 --> 00:36:59,752
starts yanking
ten dollars a spin like that.

00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:02,521
Well, maybe I can get
some other angles on this guy.

00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:03,923
Yeah, but first,

00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:06,292
give me a surveillance still
of Jekyll

00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:08,761
from the St. Sebastian's
Hospital supply room.

00:37:08,828 --> 00:37:10,262
Biometric comparison?

00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:11,597
Yeah, exactly.

00:37:11,664 --> 00:37:13,332
All right.

00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,416
WILLOWS:
<i>So, Heidi's following Langston</i>

00:37:30,483 --> 00:37:35,221
and Jekyll is following one--
or both-- of them.

00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:36,889
Yep.

00:37:36,956 --> 00:37:39,658
And somewhere along the
way, Heidi meets Jekyll,

00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:42,895
and he kills her.

00:37:42,962 --> 00:37:44,897
It's looking very possible.
JOHNSON:
Okay.

00:37:44,964 --> 00:37:46,966
There are no more angles
on this guy.
No.

00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:49,068
He's good. He ducks the cameras.

00:37:49,135 --> 00:37:51,270
(cell phone ringing)

00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:54,273
Hey, Jim.

00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,575
So, we picked up a guy
who was trying to pawn

00:37:56,642 --> 00:37:59,245
Heidi Custer's amber pendant,
and her laptop and camera.

00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:01,647
And his print matches
the bloody print

00:38:01,714 --> 00:38:03,149
we found on the rental car.

00:38:03,215 --> 00:38:05,551
Jim, it's got to be him--
Dr. Jekyll.

00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:07,520
No, this kid
is no Doogie Howser.

00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:09,488
Been spilling his guts
for the past two hours.

00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:11,690
Name is Lou Brennan.

00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:15,327
He's a busboy at the loony-tune
coffeemaker Vince's place,

00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:18,130
and he was tweaked
on more than a macchiato.

00:38:18,197 --> 00:38:22,001
<i>Said he saw Heidi talking</i>
<i>to Vincent at the coffee stand.</i>

00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:23,435
HEIDI:
Well, I'm working
on a story

00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:25,437
for a big national
news magazine.

00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:27,540
BRASS:
<i>Saw her flashing</i>
<i>a lot of green.</i>

00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:29,375
Think a $100 latte
might be the fix I need?

00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:34,113
BRASS:
<i>After Lou closed up,</i>

00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,981
<i>he waited for Heidi and Vince</i>
<i>to come back.</i>

00:38:36,048 --> 00:38:38,083
What the hell?

00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,686
Heard you give money
to people who know stuff.

00:38:40,753 --> 00:38:43,189
I know stuff
about all kinds of stuff.
You know what?

00:38:43,255 --> 00:38:46,458
I have had a belly full of crap
from losers today.

00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:48,661
I am not giving you any money.

00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:50,996
You don't think I know stuff?

00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:54,233
You mop the floors for a guy
who knows nothing, so no.

00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,235
Now, get out of my car.

00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:05,711
(grunting)

00:39:07,046 --> 00:39:08,714
(gasps)

00:39:13,419 --> 00:39:15,754
BRASS:
<i>Claims he didn't mean</i>
<i>to kill her,</i>

00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:19,725
<i>just accidentally strangled her</i>
<i>for four and a half minutes.</i>

00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:25,564
<i>Then, had to get rid</i>
<i>of his mess.</i>

00:39:34,273 --> 00:39:35,875
WILLOWS:
<i>So, Heidi's murder</i>

00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:37,409
had nothing to do
with Dr. Jekyll.

00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:39,245
It was a simple crime
of opportunity.

00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:43,282
My big question is,
if Jekyll wasn't after Heidi,

00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:46,252
what was he doing
at the Blue Aces?

00:39:47,286 --> 00:39:48,954
He was following me.

00:39:55,594 --> 00:39:57,329
The man stole my I.D. badge.

00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:58,998
He knows my face.

00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:03,636
He could have followed me
from the lab to that casino.

00:40:09,275 --> 00:40:12,545
He could have followed me home.

00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:14,914
He could have followed me here.

00:40:16,549 --> 00:40:19,819
I can talk to Brass to get a
protection detail for you.

00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:24,089
You should think
about wearing a gun again.

00:40:24,156 --> 00:40:26,759
Jekyll's had plenty
of opportunities to hurt me.

00:40:26,826 --> 00:40:28,894
I don't think
that's what he wants.

00:40:28,961 --> 00:40:30,429
SIDLE:
Don't be so sure.

00:40:30,496 --> 00:40:33,632
Jekyll's meticulous,
takes his time.

00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:36,735
He might be planning
something special for you.

00:40:36,802 --> 00:40:38,471
(cell phone ringing)

00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:40,806
Thanks.

00:40:40,873 --> 00:40:42,942
Excuse me.

00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,978
This is Langston.

00:40:46,045 --> 00:40:48,113
MAN:
It's been a while, Professor.

00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,849
Who is this?

00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:54,587
Did I come up on your phone
as "unknown"?

00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:57,690
And you answered anyway.

00:40:57,756 --> 00:40:59,358
It's nice to know you haven't

00:40:59,425 --> 00:41:01,694
lost your faith
in your fellow man.

00:41:03,028 --> 00:41:06,165
How's the real world
been treating you?

00:41:06,232 --> 00:41:10,035
Ever get nostalgic
for our school days?

00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,638
Nate Haskell.

00:41:12,705 --> 00:41:14,340
That's right.

00:41:14,406 --> 00:41:18,043
Your favorite serial killer.

00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:21,347
I'm calling with an exciting
limited-time offer.

00:41:21,413 --> 00:41:23,816
What do you want, Nate?

00:41:23,883 --> 00:41:26,352
That's the wrong question,
Professor.

00:41:26,418 --> 00:41:28,420
This isn't about what I want.

00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:30,456
This is about what you want.

00:41:30,523 --> 00:41:34,160
Or rather... <i>who</i> you want.

00:41:34,226 --> 00:41:37,163
I know who Dr. Jekyll is.
