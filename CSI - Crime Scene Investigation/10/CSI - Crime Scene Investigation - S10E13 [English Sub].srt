00:00:08,416 --> 00:00:11,368
ROBBINS:
Victim's name is Trevor Beck.

00:00:11,434 --> 00:00:14,871
Caucasian male, age 17.

00:00:14,938 --> 00:00:17,574
<i>Five foot, 11.</i>

00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:20,043
<i>154 pounds.</i>

00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,112
<i>Senior at Sagebrush</i>
<i>Valley High.</i>

00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:26,483
Appears to be well nourished
and in overall good health,

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,454
without any abnormal skin
coloring or pigmentation.

00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:03,253
♪ ♪

00:01:07,524 --> 00:01:10,861
There are several
light abrasions

00:01:10,927 --> 00:01:13,930
and contusions on the knuckles
of his right hand,

00:01:13,997 --> 00:01:15,966
<i>consistent</i>
<i>with a recent scuffle.</i>

00:01:22,305 --> 00:01:24,074
(no audible dialogue)

00:01:25,876 --> 00:01:28,311
(indistinct yelling)

00:01:38,155 --> 00:01:40,123
<i>But there do not</i>
<i>appear to be any</i>

00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,894
<i>external wounds consistent</i>
<i>with severe trauma.</i>

00:01:45,295 --> 00:01:47,931
Internal organs appear healthy.

00:01:47,998 --> 00:01:50,734
No signs of trauma or disease.

00:01:50,801 --> 00:01:53,136
Heart muscle...

00:01:55,672 --> 00:01:58,742
...is free of scarring
and necrosis.

00:01:58,809 --> 00:02:02,479
And there's no evidence
of any cardiac event.

00:02:06,483 --> 00:02:08,985
(sighs)

00:02:09,052 --> 00:02:10,320
Healthy young men like this

00:02:10,387 --> 00:02:12,322
don't simply drop dead
for no reason.

00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:16,660
I concur, which is
why I am still looking.

00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:21,131
Whoa!
(Langston exclaims)

00:02:21,198 --> 00:02:23,333
Oh!

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,503
That is one massive
cerebral edema.

00:02:28,305 --> 00:02:30,040
The meninges don't
appear to be

00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:33,109
discolored or inflamed,

00:02:33,176 --> 00:02:35,846
so I think we can safely
rule out meningitis.

00:02:37,314 --> 00:02:39,149
Did he suffer any
blows to the head?

00:02:39,216 --> 00:02:42,018
There's no evidence
of any injuries to support that.

00:02:42,085 --> 00:02:43,587
According to the police report,

00:02:43,653 --> 00:02:45,989
he was shoved at school
this morning and collapsed.

00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:49,659
And even if he
sustained a blow
during the altercation,

00:02:49,726 --> 00:02:52,229
that's not nearly enough time
to cause this much swelling.

00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:55,432
And what does
that leave us with?

00:02:55,499 --> 00:02:57,934
Drugs? Toxins?

00:02:58,001 --> 00:03:00,670
Or a prior injury
we don't know about.

Mrs. Beck,
please sit down.

00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:40,952
(sniffling):
Okay.
Okay.

00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:43,354
Just-just a few things I have
to ask you, all right?

00:03:45,623 --> 00:03:47,892
Was Trevor injured recently?

00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,696
"Injured"? How?

00:03:51,763 --> 00:03:54,365
You know, uh...
a bang in the head.

00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:56,000
Even a little bump? Anything?

00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:58,837
MRS. BECK:
<i>No. No, I mean,</i>
<i>not that I know of.</i>

00:03:58,903 --> 00:04:01,606
BRASS:
<i>No? Was he complaining</i>
<i>of, uh, headaches</i>

00:04:01,673 --> 00:04:04,342
<i>or blurred vision, nausea--</i>
<i>anything like that?</i>

00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:07,979
<i>I-- you mean, he's been</i>
<i>a little grumpy lately.</i>

00:04:08,046 --> 00:04:10,315
<i>I mean, this morning,</i>
<i>he couldn't find his car keys,</i>

00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:12,817
<i>and he... he threw a fit.</i>

00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:16,087
<i>And then, he realized</i>
<i>he'd left them in the car.</i>

00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:17,822
But, um, I think that's
just 'cause he's,

00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:19,324
he's not getting enough sleep,
you know?

00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,159
He's... he's a teenager.

00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:22,727
Sure. Sure.

00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:24,395
Sure, we all do that.
I understand.

00:04:24,462 --> 00:04:26,464
(Mrs. Beck sniffles)

00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:29,701
Was he in a fight recently?

00:04:29,768 --> 00:04:31,269
Trevor doesn't fight.

00:04:31,336 --> 00:04:34,506
He's a, um...
he was a good kid.

00:04:34,572 --> 00:04:36,975
Well, even good kids
have bad days.

00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,380
Did somebody do something
to Trevor...

00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:45,049
that, that killed him?
We can't say

00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:46,317
anything definitive.

00:04:46,384 --> 00:04:47,919
We're just looking
at possibilities.

00:04:47,986 --> 00:04:51,022
But it would be helpful
to have a diary of Trevor's

00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:52,457
comings and goings
in the last week.

00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:53,725
That would be good.

00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:56,928
How do you know anything
about a kid at his age? I...

00:04:56,995 --> 00:04:58,229
BRASS:
<i>Well, we could</i>
<i>ask his friends.</i>

00:04:58,296 --> 00:04:59,898
<i>You know, maybe</i>
<i>they could help.</i>

00:04:59,964 --> 00:05:01,866
MRS. BECK:
<i>He didn't have</i>
<i>a lot of friends.</i>

00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:05,303
<i>You know, when Trevor</i>
<i>wasn't doing his schoolwork,</i>

00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,306
<i>he was, he was</i>
<i>working on his car.</i>

00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:11,476
<i>You know, he always</i>
<i>said that he was going</i>
<i>to be an artist.</i>

00:05:11,543 --> 00:05:13,311
<i>I mean, I thought</i>
<i>that would be</i>

00:05:13,378 --> 00:05:16,781
<i>like a, you know,</i>
<i>a painter or sculptor</i>
<i>or something, you know?</i>

00:05:16,848 --> 00:05:19,150
<i>Not a gearhead.</i>

00:05:19,217 --> 00:05:23,021
<i>But he said</i>
<i>that a car was art</i>

00:05:23,088 --> 00:05:24,622
that could move.

00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:27,492
(computer beeping)

00:05:28,526 --> 00:05:30,028
<i>He started seeing a girl.</i>

00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:33,631
<i>Cindy. About a week ago.</i>

00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:35,366
<i>She came home</i>
<i>with him last night.</i>

00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:36,835
Yeah? What time was that?

00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:39,871
Let's see, they went up
to Trevor's room about 9:00.

00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:42,941
But, um, there was
no sleeping over,
so she left

00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:45,443
about, uh, 11:00, I think.

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,212
But I-I didn't
see her go.

00:05:47,278 --> 00:05:48,613
Do you have her phone number?

00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,616
No. I don't.

00:05:51,683 --> 00:05:53,284
It's okay.
It's all right.

00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:55,453
We can find that.
That's easy for us.

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,622
(line ringing)

00:05:57,689 --> 00:05:59,324
CINDY (on recording):
Hey! If you want Cindy,

00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,493
well, too bad,
'cause you can't have her.

00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:03,495
(giggles, voice mail beeps)

00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:04,662
(phone beeps off)

00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:06,931
(music plays over headphones)

00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:11,136
You don't look
nearly busy enough.
(music stops)

00:06:11,202 --> 00:06:12,470
Well, thank you.

00:06:12,537 --> 00:06:15,573
It is my gift to look relaxed
while doing many things.

00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,674
Unlike Hodges,

00:06:16,741 --> 00:06:18,676
who has the ability
to look overwhelmed

00:06:18,743 --> 00:06:20,545
while really doing
nothing at all.

00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:22,680
I'm waiting on
an A.G. waiver

00:06:22,747 --> 00:06:24,649
on a cell phone for...
WILLOWS:
Cindy Warner.

00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:26,651
It just came through.
Start "relaxing."

00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:29,387
You got it. Okay.

00:06:31,723 --> 00:06:34,025
You know,
I heard the victim's

00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:36,428
brain kind of exploded
in his head.

00:06:36,494 --> 00:06:37,929
Kind of.

00:06:37,996 --> 00:06:40,365
What does this girl have
to do with that?
No one's

00:06:40,432 --> 00:06:42,600
seen her since the night
before Trevor Beck died.

00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:44,702
She lives
with her brother,

00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:46,704
a construction worker
out of town on a job.

00:06:46,771 --> 00:06:48,339
I sent some unis
over to their apartment

00:06:48,406 --> 00:06:50,542
for a welfare check
and she wasn't there.

00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:53,144
I mean, her boyfriend drops dead
in front of the whole school,

00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:54,646
and she's nowhere to be found.

00:06:54,712 --> 00:06:56,448
That qualifies
as suspicious to me.

00:06:56,514 --> 00:06:57,916
Hmm.
(computer beeps)

00:06:57,982 --> 00:07:00,085
Oh, okay.
Her cell is

00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:02,353
registered
and active at a tower

00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,657
on Washington Boulevard
between Oak and Maple.

00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:11,863
Sagebrush Valley High.

00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,765
Well, it is a school day.

00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:17,940
According to the office,

00:07:18,007 --> 00:07:19,942
Cindy was not in her
homeroom this morning.

00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:21,343
WILLOWS (on phone):
Well, according to my daughter,

00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,212
some kids just go to school
to hang out.

00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,880
Never set foot in a classroom.

00:07:24,947 --> 00:07:26,182
Oh, I have her schedule.

00:07:26,248 --> 00:07:28,417
I will beat the bushes
and see what turns up.

00:07:28,484 --> 00:07:30,486
Bye.

00:07:35,724 --> 00:07:37,960
Cindy?

00:07:38,027 --> 00:07:40,696
Sorry?
This is

00:07:40,763 --> 00:07:41,964
Cindy Warner's locker.

00:07:42,031 --> 00:07:43,966
Yeah and mine.
We share.

00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:45,301
Oh, uh, well,
I'm Sara Sidle.

00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:47,336
I'm with the crime lab.
What's your name?

00:07:47,403 --> 00:07:49,105
Renata Clarke.

00:07:49,171 --> 00:07:51,006
I'm going to need
to get in there, Renata.

00:07:51,073 --> 00:07:53,375
Like the teachers say

00:07:53,442 --> 00:07:55,111
"no expectation of privacy."

00:07:56,645 --> 00:07:58,681
So did Cindy do
something wrong?

00:07:58,747 --> 00:08:00,349
Have you seen her today?
No.

00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,685
I mean, not since
the other night.

00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:05,154
Actually, before what
happened with Trevor.

00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:06,789
And I've been texting
her like crazy

00:08:06,856 --> 00:08:07,957
and Cindy's my biff.

00:08:08,023 --> 00:08:09,325
We always talk
before bed.

00:08:09,391 --> 00:08:10,559
She text you back?

00:08:12,128 --> 00:08:13,696
And you're not worried
about her at all?

00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:15,264
Of course
I'm worried about her.

00:08:15,331 --> 00:08:16,565
Her boyfriend, like, died.

00:08:16,632 --> 00:08:19,001
But I mean, half the school
went home after that

00:08:19,068 --> 00:08:20,336
and I figured
Cindy did, too.

00:08:20,402 --> 00:08:23,506
She just wasn't ready to talk.

00:08:23,572 --> 00:08:26,408
And I can't even imagine
how she was feeling.

00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:32,882
You think Cindy
ran away or something?

00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:34,550
We don't know.

00:08:34,617 --> 00:08:35,818
(school bell rings)

00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:38,087
Well, I'm going to be
late for class.

00:08:38,154 --> 00:08:39,321
Oh, uh, no problem.
Go ahead.

00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:41,557
But, um, could
you do me a favor?

00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:44,727
If Cindy does get in touch
with you, could you

00:08:44,794 --> 00:08:46,562
call me please?
Sure.

00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:48,631
Thanks.

00:08:54,804 --> 00:08:56,806
(indistinct chatter)

00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:03,512
Hey!
STOKES:
Hi.

00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:05,848
What are you doing here?
I called Impound for this.

00:09:05,915 --> 00:09:07,583
Yeah, they're
still sorting out

00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,418
a multi-car pileup
on the 15.

00:09:09,485 --> 00:09:10,786
Thought I'd save
them some trouble.

00:09:10,853 --> 00:09:12,421
Take care of this
one in the field.

00:09:12,488 --> 00:09:14,557
Nobody mentioned
it was electric.

00:09:14,623 --> 00:09:16,192
So?

00:09:16,258 --> 00:09:18,727
So this is
a 1958 Porsche Speedster.

00:09:18,794 --> 00:09:20,095
So?

00:09:20,162 --> 00:09:22,131
<i>So,</i> it's a classic.

00:09:22,198 --> 00:09:23,566
James Dean had
one of these.

00:09:23,632 --> 00:09:26,035
Putting an electric motor
in this is sacrilegious.

00:09:26,102 --> 00:09:27,269
Not to polar bears.

Did you process
the interior?

00:09:30,673 --> 00:09:32,108
No, no, not yet.

00:09:32,174 --> 00:09:34,443
Uh-oh.

00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,879
Looks like we've got
some more blasphemy here.
Yeah.

00:09:36,946 --> 00:09:39,482
I saw that fresh
yellow paint scrape
passenger's side door.

00:09:39,548 --> 00:09:42,485
Already collected for trace.
Hmm.

00:09:43,953 --> 00:09:46,622
You know, these EVs
have diagnostic

00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:48,891

They log

00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,227
range, speed, acceleration,

00:09:51,293 --> 00:09:53,129

all that stuff.

00:09:53,195 --> 00:09:55,865

You know, for such

you have a funny way
of showing it.

You know what I think happened?

00:12:30,686 --> 00:12:33,456
I think it all had
to do with Cindy Warner.

00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,925
I'm perplexed.

00:12:38,027 --> 00:12:39,195
Come on.

00:12:40,996 --> 00:12:43,232
Cindy used to be my lady.

00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:45,968
Then she started keeping
his passenger seat warm.

00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:48,504
But you never know
when history's

00:12:48,571 --> 00:12:50,506
going to repeat itself--
that's the way I saw it.

00:12:50,573 --> 00:12:52,775
The way I see it is, uh,
you get in a fight with Trevor

00:12:52,842 --> 00:12:55,277
to win Cindy back,
and then Trevor kicked your ass.

00:12:55,344 --> 00:12:58,447
17 hours later, he ends up dead
and Cindy goes missing.

00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:03,018
She's missing?

00:13:03,085 --> 00:13:04,420
Yeah.

00:13:04,487 --> 00:13:06,088
Where is she?

00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:07,857
If we knew where she was,
she wouldn't be missing.

00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,494
Now, where did you go
after Trevor decked you?

00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,329
Back here.

00:13:13,395 --> 00:13:14,763
Look, I swear.
Ask my boss.

00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,198
I was helping with inventory.

00:13:16,265 --> 00:13:17,333
When was the last you saw Cindy?

00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,668
You're looking at it.

00:13:19,735 --> 00:13:22,905
STOKES:
It looks like his brain stem
has been jammed into his spine.

00:13:22,972 --> 00:13:24,240
Essentially it has.

00:13:24,306 --> 00:13:27,409
It's a rare condition known
as Chiari malformation.

00:13:27,476 --> 00:13:29,445
It's a deformity of the skull

00:13:29,512 --> 00:13:31,781
that displaces
the cerebellum

00:13:31,847 --> 00:13:34,617
and the brain stem
into the spinal canal.

00:13:34,683 --> 00:13:36,418
Most people don't even
realize they have it

00:13:36,485 --> 00:13:38,120
until they've experienced
some kind of trauma

00:13:38,187 --> 00:13:40,523
or vigorous
neck flexion.

00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:42,191
Like a blow to the head?
Exactly.

00:13:42,258 --> 00:13:45,594
<i>If that happens,</i>
<i>the condition creates swelling,</i>

00:13:45,661 --> 00:13:49,665
<i>edema, resulting in massive</i>
<i>intracranial pressure.</i>

00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:52,568
The headaches can be
excruciating.
WILLOWS:
According to the mother,

00:13:52,635 --> 00:13:54,503
Trevor had been irritable.

00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,905
And wasn't sleeping very well.

00:13:55,971 --> 00:13:57,706
It's got to be hard
to sleep when your brain's

00:13:57,773 --> 00:13:59,074
blowing up in your skull
like that, huh?

00:13:59,141 --> 00:14:00,910
SIDLE:
Trevor was also taking

00:14:00,976 --> 00:14:03,779
antidepressants,
MAO inhibitors.

00:14:03,846 --> 00:14:05,014
I know they spike
blood pressure,

00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,882
but wouldn't they have worsened
the swelling?

00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:08,017
LANGSTON:
Definitely.

00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,519
The existing Chiari,
the antidepressants,

00:14:10,586 --> 00:14:11,854
and whatever struck his head,

00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:15,724
all combined to create
an acute hypertensive crisis--

00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:16,892
a perfect storm.

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,127
So whoever gave him the drugs

00:14:18,194 --> 00:14:19,361
was also contributing
to his death.

00:14:19,428 --> 00:14:21,030
Yes.
WILLOWS:
We still don't know

00:14:21,096 --> 00:14:24,099
what hit him or who
or where it happened.

00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,436
Well, the diagnostic modules
in Trevor's Franken-Porsche

00:14:27,503 --> 00:14:29,105
did give us
a little something there.

00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:32,007
On the night before his
last drive from home

00:14:32,074 --> 00:14:34,410
to school,
Trevor drove

00:14:34,477 --> 00:14:37,179
about 14 miles in the course
of an hour and a half

00:14:37,246 --> 00:14:38,414
without turning his engine off.

00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:42,651
That's seven miles out,
seven miles back...

00:14:42,718 --> 00:14:44,286
Seven mile search radius.

00:14:44,353 --> 00:14:46,055
And just before
he made that trip

00:14:46,122 --> 00:14:48,591
is the last time that
Cindy Warner was seen.

00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:54,997

00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,433
The treads
on the left are

00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,402
a thin five-bar tire
that's consistent

00:20:13,469 --> 00:20:14,770
with the ones on Trevor's car.

00:20:14,837 --> 00:20:15,938
The treads on the right

00:20:16,004 --> 00:20:18,040
are from his
mystery opponent.

00:20:18,107 --> 00:20:20,275
They're 17-inch,
Goodyear Eagles

00:20:20,342 --> 00:20:22,911
with a wheel width
of approximately 70 inches.

00:20:22,978 --> 00:20:24,580
STOKES:
A lot of cars
on the road today

00:20:24,646 --> 00:20:25,981
that fit that
description.

00:20:26,048 --> 00:20:27,316
Hodges was able

00:20:27,382 --> 00:20:29,151
to I.D. the yellow flakes
in Cindy's wounds

00:20:29,218 --> 00:20:30,319
and the point of impact.

00:20:30,385 --> 00:20:32,087
It's Flatz uranium number two.

00:20:32,154 --> 00:20:33,388
And it is the same

00:20:33,455 --> 00:20:35,557
paint as the yellow
scrape that we found

00:20:35,624 --> 00:20:37,960
on Trevor's door.
Okay, so...

00:20:38,026 --> 00:20:41,630
the two cars race,
one swipes the other.

00:20:41,697 --> 00:20:46,135
The yellow car loses control
and takes out Cindy.

00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:48,103
That would explain
why there was no damage

00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,605
to the front-end
of Trevor's car.

00:20:49,671 --> 00:20:51,039
So we're looking for

00:20:51,106 --> 00:20:53,442
a yellow street racer
in Las Vegas? Great.

00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:55,944
That should
narrow it down to just
a few hundred suspects.

00:20:56,011 --> 00:20:58,847
Well, maybe Trevor's
drug dealer can help
us out with that.

00:20:58,914 --> 00:21:00,949
I tracked the lot number
on the phenelzine

00:21:01,016 --> 00:21:02,284
pack you found.

00:21:02,351 --> 00:21:04,186
It's from a local pharmacy.
I called the owner.

00:21:04,253 --> 00:21:05,854
His son works as a stock boy

00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:08,490
<i>and</i> he goes
to Trevor's school.

00:21:09,525 --> 00:21:10,926
BOY:
A drug dealer?

00:21:10,993 --> 00:21:12,461
Me?

00:21:12,528 --> 00:21:14,997
Do I look like
Tony Montoya to you?

00:21:15,063 --> 00:21:16,899
Damn it, Rishi,
stop messing around.

00:21:16,965 --> 00:21:18,567
That's good advice.

00:21:18,634 --> 00:21:20,102
We know that you're dealing.

00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:22,371
I never took any cash
from Trevor.

00:21:24,373 --> 00:21:26,775
We were in auto shop together.

00:21:26,842 --> 00:21:29,845
He was like a genius,
and I have this mental blockage

00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:31,079
when it comes to things
mechanical,

00:21:31,146 --> 00:21:33,749
so I exchanged
my goods for his services.

00:21:33,816 --> 00:21:35,584
Tutoring.

00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:37,753
All this and you're failing
auto shop, too?

00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,755
That's right, Dad!

00:21:39,822 --> 00:21:41,256
I'm never going
to be an engineer.

00:21:41,323 --> 00:21:43,158
Strip me of my Indian.

00:21:43,225 --> 00:21:45,260
The night before he died...

00:21:45,327 --> 00:21:47,663
who was Trevor racing?

00:21:47,729 --> 00:21:49,198
No one.
Come on.

00:21:49,264 --> 00:21:51,700
I'm telling you,
Trevor wasn't a racer.

00:21:51,767 --> 00:21:53,035
Tell the police the truth!

00:21:54,203 --> 00:21:56,171
He wasn't a racer!

00:21:56,238 --> 00:21:58,440
Not as far I know.

00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,610
That car was like his baby.
Well, racing

00:22:01,677 --> 00:22:03,712
is what a car like that
is built for.

00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:06,782
We know that Trevor was
out in the desert drag racing

00:22:06,849 --> 00:22:09,418
a yellow car,
which killed Cindy Warner.

00:22:11,754 --> 00:22:14,156
Do you know somebody
with a yellow car?

00:22:18,026 --> 00:22:21,563
I don't think you're aware
of what's going on here.

00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,565
The pills that you gave Trevor

00:22:23,632 --> 00:22:24,933
helped kill him.

00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,403
No-no-no, he...
he asked me for the painkillers.

00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,739
But that stuff's addictive,
so I gave him the uppers.

00:22:30,806 --> 00:22:32,374
Which are
controlled substances.

00:22:32,441 --> 00:22:34,209
Trafficking them is a felony.

00:22:35,978 --> 00:22:37,513
Hey, I'm still a minor.

00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:38,647
But your father isn't.

00:22:38,714 --> 00:22:41,583
He's responsible for
those medications.

00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:44,153
And if he's found
criminally liable,

00:22:44,219 --> 00:22:45,754
he could lose his store.

00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:49,425
Oh, my God.

00:22:50,726 --> 00:22:52,361
Oh, my God.

00:22:52,428 --> 00:22:53,962
Rishi, what have you done?

00:22:56,165 --> 00:23:00,502
The yellow car...

00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:02,337
it's got to be a Demon.

00:23:02,404 --> 00:23:04,673
They're a gang.
Their color's yellow.
That's all I know.

00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,074
I swear.

00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:08,377
I'm sorry, Dad.

00:23:09,478 --> 00:23:10,646

He got busted in a chop shop
raid last summer,

but since he was a juvee,

00:27:12,984 --> 00:27:15,320
and not principally involved,
they turned him loose.

00:27:15,386 --> 00:27:18,022

he's involved in this, too.

width matches,

00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,870
So, Trevor smokes Renata
in an organized race.

00:29:12,937 --> 00:29:15,440
Maybe the desert was a rematch.

00:29:18,843 --> 00:29:20,845
(engine revs, ticks)

00:29:22,413 --> 00:29:25,950
All right, you hear that
light ticking sound?

00:29:26,017 --> 00:29:28,019
That's the hot solid lifter cam.

00:29:28,086 --> 00:29:30,054
The valves need adjusting.

00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:32,557
Shut it down.
See, if you listen,

00:29:32,624 --> 00:29:34,759
your car will tell you
everything.

00:29:34,826 --> 00:29:36,127
There's no guesswork.

00:29:36,194 --> 00:29:38,296
Unlike your girlfriend,
she'll tell you exactly

00:29:38,363 --> 00:29:40,131
what she means,
but you have

00:29:40,198 --> 00:29:42,867
to listen, because...

00:29:44,435 --> 00:29:47,772
If you don't, your car's
just a noisy heap of metal.

00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:49,674
So take care
of those valves.
Okay, Gus.

00:29:49,741 --> 00:29:51,209
Hi. Can I help you?

00:29:51,276 --> 00:29:53,578
Hi there. Mr. Davis?
Yes.

00:29:53,645 --> 00:29:56,014
We're with the crime lab.

00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,149
I understand that
you're Renata's legal guardian.

00:29:58,216 --> 00:30:02,253
I am. I'm her uncle
and her shop teacher.

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,455
We're going to need to take
a look at her car.

00:30:04,522 --> 00:30:07,191
Sure. Uh, yeah,
it's right over here,

00:30:07,258 --> 00:30:09,360
only it's not for sale.

00:30:09,427 --> 00:30:11,362
Renata? Come on out.

00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:14,365
Uh, these people want
to take a look at the car.

00:30:17,502 --> 00:30:19,103
What's this all about, Gus?

00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,505
I don't know.

00:30:24,042 --> 00:30:26,544
No signs of blood spatter
or body damage.

00:30:26,611 --> 00:30:28,680
Even the tires look clean.

00:30:28,746 --> 00:30:30,548
But the headlights <i>are</i> glass.

00:30:35,353 --> 00:30:36,788
Well, the wheel width is right.

00:30:36,854 --> 00:30:38,990
SIDLE:
There's no way we're
off base on this.

00:30:43,595 --> 00:30:44,862
Maybe we're not.

00:30:44,929 --> 00:30:47,065
Check it out.

00:30:47,131 --> 00:30:50,568
Yellow paint overspray.

00:30:50,635 --> 00:30:52,604
This area's been recently
repaired and repainted.

00:30:56,741 --> 00:30:58,242
What are you looking for?

00:31:00,044 --> 00:31:01,312
Renata...

00:31:01,379 --> 00:31:04,182
where were you the night
that Cindy went missing?

00:31:04,249 --> 00:31:07,051
Um, I went to Giant Burger

00:31:07,118 --> 00:31:08,886
to meet up with some
friends for dinner.

00:31:08,953 --> 00:31:10,822
When the fries got cold,
I came home.

00:31:10,888 --> 00:31:12,624
Studied calc and fell
asleep on my textbook.

00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,192
True story.

00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:16,194
What were you calling
Cindy about at 1:00
in the morning?

00:31:16,261 --> 00:31:19,664
Around midnight, I woke up,
ink on my face and everything.

00:31:19,731 --> 00:31:21,299
I watched
the <i>Gossip Girl</i> I DVR'd

00:31:21,366 --> 00:31:23,334
and called Cindy to go
over the pertinent details.

00:31:23,401 --> 00:31:24,869
Did you made plans to meet up?

00:31:24,936 --> 00:31:26,537
"Meet up"?

00:31:26,604 --> 00:31:27,705
There's no meeting up.

00:31:27,772 --> 00:31:29,207
Cindy and I talk every night.

00:31:29,274 --> 00:31:31,175
This is nothing
out of the ordinary.

00:31:31,242 --> 00:31:33,177
Wait.

00:31:33,244 --> 00:31:36,347
You couldn't possibly think
I was there when Cindy...

00:31:36,414 --> 00:31:38,249
When Cindy what?
You think I killed her?

00:31:39,484 --> 00:31:41,019
Cindy was my best friend!

00:31:41,085 --> 00:31:42,220
I would never hurt her!

00:31:42,287 --> 00:31:43,454
Never!
Renata.

00:31:43,521 --> 00:31:44,923
What's this all about?

00:31:44,989 --> 00:31:46,157
Evidence consistent
with this car

00:31:46,224 --> 00:31:48,793
was collected at
a crime scene, Mr. Davis.

00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,095
This vehicle
will now be impounded.

00:31:51,162 --> 00:31:54,198
Impound? What? Because of some
stupid measuring tape?

00:31:54,265 --> 00:31:55,566
You can't take it!

00:31:55,633 --> 00:31:57,268
You can't let them take my car!
You don't

00:31:57,335 --> 00:31:58,436
actually have a choice
in the matter.

00:31:58,503 --> 00:31:59,737
Okay. Fine. Look.

00:31:59,804 --> 00:32:01,205
She was at home.

00:32:01,272 --> 00:32:02,874
I was with her.

00:32:02,941 --> 00:32:04,442
And we're done talking.

00:32:19,547 --> 00:32:22,250
Okay, you guys are
looking for fibers

00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:24,919
blood, hair-- any transfer
that would confirm

00:32:24,986 --> 00:32:27,689
this is the vehicle that struck
and killed Cindy Warner, okay?

00:32:27,755 --> 00:32:30,859
The suspect hides the murder
weapon in plain sight,

00:32:30,925 --> 00:32:33,094
in her auto shop class.

00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:35,256
That's pretty sophisticated
for a high school girl.
Right.

00:32:35,323 --> 00:32:37,025
She's definitely more
sophisticated than the ones

00:32:37,091 --> 00:32:39,093
you chat with on
the <i>Twilight</i> message boards.

00:32:41,095 --> 00:32:42,130
Wait, wait.

00:32:42,196 --> 00:32:43,431
So, I'm guessing
that about

00:32:43,498 --> 00:32:45,500
a million grubby
teenagers probably

00:32:45,566 --> 00:32:47,035
pawed their way
all around this thing.

00:32:47,101 --> 00:32:48,636
So how exactly do we put

00:32:48,703 --> 00:32:51,105
Renata behind the wheel
when Cindy was killed?

00:32:51,172 --> 00:32:53,541
By going over it
with a fine-tooth comb.

00:32:53,608 --> 00:32:55,510
If we can rule out
other drivers,

00:32:55,576 --> 00:32:57,712
then we can build
a pretty good case.
Right.

00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:59,714
What if the other driver
was wearing gloves?

00:32:59,781 --> 00:33:03,284
Helping or hindering, Wendy,
which one's it going to be?

00:33:03,351 --> 00:33:04,318
I am helping.

00:33:04,385 --> 00:33:06,688
Attagirl. Thanks.

00:33:07,722 --> 00:33:08,923
(shutter clicks)

00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:12,593
SIMMS:
What do you got there?

00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,266
Kids.
Gross.

00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:21,502
SIDLE:
<i>There are only two ways</i>
<i>to get to the drag</i>

00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:22,670
<i>where Cindy was killed.</i>

00:33:22,737 --> 00:33:24,539
One is an exit
off the 95.
Mm-hmm.

00:33:24,605 --> 00:33:26,441
And the other's a turn
off Blue Diamond Road,

00:33:26,507 --> 00:33:28,509
which is the way to get
there from Henderson.

00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:31,813
And where both Trevor
and Renata live.

00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:34,982
Is there a traffic camera
or video surveillance

00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:37,318
at the Blue Diamond
intersection?
I am just going
to check that out.

00:33:37,385 --> 00:33:39,554
Good. PDs doing
their part.

00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,490
Somebody's bound
to get lucky.

00:33:42,557 --> 00:33:45,426
This is a 1933 Ford Roadster.

00:33:45,493 --> 00:33:48,029
It was involved
in a street race that resulted

00:33:48,096 --> 00:33:49,597
in the death of a teenage girl.

00:33:49,664 --> 00:33:51,866
Now, we have reason to believe
that the street gang known

00:33:51,933 --> 00:33:53,768
as the Demons
aided the driver

00:33:53,835 --> 00:33:55,636
by chopping the
parts of this car

00:33:55,703 --> 00:33:57,171
<i>immediately after the incident.</i>

00:33:57,238 --> 00:33:59,607
<i>Now, the gang unit has supplied</i>
<i>you with a list of the known</i>

00:33:59,674 --> 00:34:01,275
<i>Demon chop shops,</i>

00:34:01,342 --> 00:34:04,145
<i>several of which are fronted</i>
<i>by legitimate businesses.</i>

00:34:04,212 --> 00:34:06,614
Now, the job is
to locate and recover

00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:08,683
any and all parts
from this vehicle.

00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,685
And when you do so,
give CSI a call.

00:34:12,754 --> 00:34:14,589
♪ ♪

00:34:42,116 --> 00:34:44,118

00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,578
Cindy Warner's

00:35:10,645 --> 00:35:12,580
sweater made quite
the impression

00:35:12,647 --> 00:35:14,449
on the hood of Renata's car.

00:35:14,515 --> 00:35:16,284
(screaming)

00:35:16,351 --> 00:35:18,619
<i>There was so much</i>
<i>kinetic energy transferred</i>

00:35:18,686 --> 00:35:21,356
in the collision that when
the fabric came into contact

00:35:21,422 --> 00:35:23,391
with the hood, it actually

00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:26,060
deformed the clear coat
and the paint.

00:35:26,127 --> 00:35:28,730
After that, she takes
the car to the Demons

00:35:28,796 --> 00:35:32,266
who replace the parts and
paint everything to match.

00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:34,268
And she pretends
the whole thing didn't happen.

00:35:34,335 --> 00:35:35,536
Were there any other prints

00:35:35,603 --> 00:35:36,938
besides hers
on the steering wheel?

00:35:37,005 --> 00:35:39,741
No. No, we got her
as good as we can.

00:35:39,807 --> 00:35:41,809
You know, there's one thing
that I still don't get.

00:35:41,876 --> 00:35:46,981
So, Renata loses to Trevor
in a legal, organized race,

00:35:47,048 --> 00:35:49,417
and then a week later,
they have a rematch

00:35:49,484 --> 00:35:51,419
at an illegal drag
in the desert.

00:35:51,486 --> 00:35:53,755
Why not just wait
until the next Rumble?

00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:56,691
Racer mentality
runs in her family.

00:35:56,758 --> 00:35:58,292
Her guardian
was on the stock car

00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:00,094
circuit in the '70s.

00:36:00,161 --> 00:36:01,462
Made a bit of a name
for himself.

00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:03,731
Back then, guys used
to build their own cars

00:36:03,798 --> 00:36:05,166
and race them for pink slips.

00:36:05,233 --> 00:36:07,635
He obviously passed
the bug on to Renata.

00:36:07,702 --> 00:36:09,470
Uh, guys, we got
a problem.

00:36:09,537 --> 00:36:11,973
These were taken
by a traffic camera

00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,642
on Blue Diamond Road
the night of Cindy's death.

00:36:14,709 --> 00:36:17,111
STOKES:
That's Trevor's Porsche

00:36:17,178 --> 00:36:18,279
with Renata
behind the wheel.

00:36:18,346 --> 00:36:19,414
That doesn't
make any sense.

00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,648
It blows up
our whole theory.

00:36:20,715 --> 00:36:21,883
Trevor wasn't in the desert.

00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:23,484
It wasn't a rematch.

00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:26,120
So then what-- he let
Renata borrow his car

00:36:26,187 --> 00:36:27,789
to... what?

00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:28,956
Race who?

00:36:29,023 --> 00:36:30,158
Her car was
already there.

00:36:30,224 --> 00:36:32,293
STOKES:
We're missing something.

00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,162
SIDLE: Okay, but what?

00:36:39,367 --> 00:36:40,835
I think I know.

00:36:40,902 --> 00:36:43,304
(gum rattles)

00:36:45,873 --> 00:36:47,075
Want a piece of gum?

00:36:48,843 --> 00:36:50,645
Piece of gum, Gus?

00:36:53,381 --> 00:36:55,583
We know you didn't
race Trevor in the
desert, Renata.

00:36:57,518 --> 00:37:00,188
Finally. It was starting
to feel like harassment.

00:37:00,254 --> 00:37:02,223
You were racing each other.

00:37:04,292 --> 00:37:05,593
We found a wad
of chewing gum stuck

00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,161
on the back of the steering
wheel of Renata's car.

00:37:07,228 --> 00:37:09,697
I know you're a fan of
Chuck Yeager's. So am I.

00:37:09,764 --> 00:37:12,667
Chuck used to snag
a stick of Beeman

00:37:12,734 --> 00:37:14,502
from his mechanic before
he did a test flight.

00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:16,771
And then he'd take
the gum, right?

00:37:16,838 --> 00:37:19,207
And he'd place it...

00:37:19,273 --> 00:37:21,409
right on the cockpit.

00:37:21,476 --> 00:37:25,346
So it'd be there
on his safe return home.

00:37:25,413 --> 00:37:27,415
And I guess that in your
racing days, you'd leave

00:37:27,482 --> 00:37:29,017
a wad of gum on
the steering wheel?

00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:30,251
Just like Chuck.

00:37:32,653 --> 00:37:34,255
Well, once we match

00:37:34,322 --> 00:37:35,757
your DNA to that
chewing gum,

00:37:35,823 --> 00:37:37,558
it's like the checkered flag
for us.

00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:39,060
So, I chew gum.

00:37:39,127 --> 00:37:40,795
Renata and I work together

00:37:40,862 --> 00:37:42,330
on that car
all the time.

00:37:42,397 --> 00:37:43,765
That doesn't prove anything.

00:37:43,831 --> 00:37:46,300
The morning that Trevor died,

00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:47,935
he couldn't find his car keys,

00:37:48,002 --> 00:37:51,673
but he said found them
later inside his car.

00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:55,810
So I think that you
got your BFF Cindy

00:37:55,877 --> 00:37:57,879
to steal the car and
bring it out the desert

00:37:57,945 --> 00:37:59,147
so you could race it.

00:37:59,213 --> 00:38:01,049
And after Cindy
got killed,

00:38:01,115 --> 00:38:03,418
you drove the car back
into Trevor's house

00:38:03,484 --> 00:38:06,487
and left the keys
inside the car.

00:38:18,933 --> 00:38:20,935
He...

00:38:21,002 --> 00:38:22,770
We, we didn't mean to...
We didn't do

00:38:22,837 --> 00:38:25,039
anything.

00:38:25,106 --> 00:38:26,541
And we're leaving.

00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:28,576
No, you're not leaving.
Well, wait a minute.

00:38:28,643 --> 00:38:31,079
Actually, you can leave.

00:38:31,145 --> 00:38:32,280
But you're going to stay.

00:38:32,347 --> 00:38:34,048
You're under arrest.

00:38:34,115 --> 00:38:35,983
Cuff her.
Read her her rights.

00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,552
Charge is felony murder.
She were there.

00:38:37,618 --> 00:38:39,754
You want to give her a hug,
buddy, now's a good time.

00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:41,422
No, wait. N-now stop!
RENATA:
It's okay, Gus.

00:38:41,489 --> 00:38:42,990
I'm going to be okay.
No.

00:38:43,057 --> 00:38:43,958
Don't.

00:38:44,025 --> 00:38:46,527
It's my fault.
Don't!

00:38:47,862 --> 00:38:49,397
It was my fault.

00:38:49,464 --> 00:38:51,632
(cheering)

00:38:53,534 --> 00:38:54,936
What the hell
happened out there?

00:38:55,003 --> 00:38:56,504
That guy's never raced
a day in his life

00:38:56,571 --> 00:38:58,439
and he beat you?!
His car runs like

00:38:58,506 --> 00:39:00,441
it's on jet fuel.
There's no beating that.

00:39:00,508 --> 00:39:01,809
You were slow
on your gear changes.

00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:03,811
If you had the guts
of a real racer

00:39:03,878 --> 00:39:06,681
you would've beat him!
His car is better
than ours, Gus.

00:39:06,748 --> 00:39:08,416
Get over it!

00:39:09,684 --> 00:39:12,286
I saw Trevor's little toaster

00:39:12,353 --> 00:39:14,455
all the time in class.

00:39:14,522 --> 00:39:16,691
It's not about what's
under the hood.

00:39:16,758 --> 00:39:18,826
And I had to show

00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:22,130
Renata that what matters most
is the heart behind the wheel.

00:39:22,196 --> 00:39:24,565
<i>Cindy was dating Trevor.</i>

00:39:26,067 --> 00:39:31,839
<i>I got Renata to convince Cindy</i>
<i>to steal Trevor's car.</i>

00:39:31,906 --> 00:39:35,343
<i>so I could prove my point.</i>

00:39:46,187 --> 00:39:47,955
<i>I don't know what came over me.</i>

00:39:48,022 --> 00:39:51,926
<i>I just never liked</i>
<i>to lose to anyone.</i>

00:39:57,398 --> 00:39:59,000
(Cindy screaming)

00:39:59,801 --> 00:40:01,836
RENATA:
Cindy!

00:40:01,903 --> 00:40:04,372
Cindy!
Get in the car!
Get in the car!

00:40:04,439 --> 00:40:06,174
(panting, crying)

00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,942
No! We have to find her!

00:40:08,009 --> 00:40:09,811
All right, I will,
but I want you out of here.

00:40:09,877 --> 00:40:11,879
Take Trevor's car
back and go home.

00:40:18,753 --> 00:40:22,323
I tried.

00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:24,459
I tried to find her,
but I couldn't.

00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,265
But I felt that hit.

00:40:33,968 --> 00:40:36,304
There was nothing
I could do for her.

00:40:37,572 --> 00:40:40,742
I gave that Miyamoto
kid 500 bucks

00:40:40,808 --> 00:40:44,212
to make the car
like new overnight.

00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:48,516
This is on me.

00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:51,052
RENATA (crying):
No.

00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,054
It was my fault.

00:40:53,121 --> 00:40:55,590
If I hadn't had Cindy
steal Trevor's car,

00:40:55,656 --> 00:40:58,393
she never would have been out
there in the first place.

00:40:58,459 --> 00:40:59,794
You did.

00:41:00,828 --> 00:41:02,463
She was.

00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,232
Who won?

00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,737
WILLOWS:
<i>Brass said the D.A.'s</i>

00:41:09,804 --> 00:41:11,472
going to charge
them both.

00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:13,508
STOKES:
There you go--
two lives ruined,

00:41:13,574 --> 00:41:15,410
two dead kids
and for what?

00:41:15,476 --> 00:41:18,312
So some old-time race car
driver could show off?

00:41:18,379 --> 00:41:19,714
It's a shame.

00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:21,449
When you're young,
you think you're immortal.

00:41:21,516 --> 00:41:22,583
And when you get older,

00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,285
you just want to remember
how that felt.

00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,056
Driving crazy fast
on an open road.

00:41:28,122 --> 00:41:30,158
We're not getting
that old, are we?
(chuckles)

00:41:30,224 --> 00:41:31,526
Good night, Nicky.

00:41:31,592 --> 00:41:33,594
Good night, Catherine.
I'll see you tomorrow.
