ANDREWS: I don't.
I swear to God.

00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,524
I don't know anything.

Who's Harry?

00:01:03,594 --> 00:01:06,130

Don't be stupid, Henry.

00:01:06,197 --> 00:01:08,265
Now's no time to play dumb.

00:01:08,332 --> 00:01:10,968
'Cause Harry don't like it
when people play dumb.

00:01:11,035 --> 00:01:13,104
Understand?

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,973
Please, look, if you
just give me a hint,

00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,242
I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

00:01:21,145 --> 00:01:22,346

Hey, man!

You scared the crap out of me!

00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:35,192

00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:36,460
Hey, hey, come on!
I'm driving!

00:01:36,527 --> 00:01:38,796
It was all for a laugh!
God!

00:01:38,863 --> 00:01:41,866
Henry, my friend, you are
about to have the best birthday

00:01:41,932 --> 00:01:44,669
of your life,
because we are taking you

00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:49,440
to the one,
the only, Harry's Hog Hideout.

00:01:49,507 --> 00:01:51,542
Yeah!
What's a hog hideout?

00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:53,778
It's only the best barbecue
known to mankind.

00:01:53,844 --> 00:01:55,846
It's a little bit
of a drive,

00:01:55,913 --> 00:01:59,016
but don't worry.
Greg knows where it is.

00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,919
SANDERS:
I thought you said
<i>you</i> knew where it is.

00:02:03,454 --> 00:02:05,222
It's just a bit

00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:08,492
ANDREWS:
Look, if this place,
if it's so great,

00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,960
then how come
I've never heard of it?

00:02:10,027 --> 00:02:11,028
Come on, man.

00:02:11,095 --> 00:02:12,963
A little trust, baby.

00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,865
Come on.
It's your birthday.

00:02:14,932 --> 00:02:17,201
Yeah.
I hate my birthdays.

00:02:17,268 --> 00:02:18,269
They always suck.

00:02:21,272 --> 00:02:23,541
Oh, great, we got
a full moon tonight, too,

00:02:23,607 --> 00:02:25,843
so every nut job
in the state will be out.

00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,411
I'm surprised at you, Henry.

00:02:27,478 --> 00:02:29,647
There's absolutely no
statistical evidence linking

00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:32,883
lunar cycles to an increase
in irrational,

00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,652

00:03:05,816 --> 00:03:07,985

You got a little
something.
What?

00:03:10,788 --> 00:03:13,657
ANDREWS:
Aah, I think
I sprained my ankle.

00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:18,195
Damn!

00:03:18,262 --> 00:03:20,264

Nope.
Uh-uh.
No.

00:03:35,946 --> 00:03:37,481
Doesn't really matter.

00:03:37,548 --> 00:03:40,584
Harry's is about a mile
up that way, I think.

The common

through that window
ninja-style,

could shoot it,

00:08:23,256 --> 00:08:26,726

00:12:15,055 --> 00:12:17,224
So you're telling me you slept
through the whole attack?

00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,892
Attack?!

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,027
(sobbing):
Oh, God, there was an attack...

00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,765
I have apnea.

00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:29,269
Which means I have
a chronic sleep deficit.

00:12:29,336 --> 00:12:32,172
When I put on the machine,
I'm dead to the world.

00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:33,840
Who would want
to kill Lily?

00:12:33,907 --> 00:12:35,141
Well, that's what
we're here to find out.

00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,010
Look... (groaning)

00:12:37,077 --> 00:12:39,446
You o... you okay?

00:12:39,513 --> 00:12:42,048
(groaning)

00:12:42,115 --> 00:12:43,116
I have Crohn's disease.

00:12:43,183 --> 00:12:44,651
HIGGINS:
You know what that is?

00:12:44,718 --> 00:12:46,319
Yes, an inflammatory disorder

00:12:46,386 --> 00:12:47,754
of undetermined
etiology.

00:12:47,821 --> 00:12:49,189
It ulcerates
the intestine.

00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:50,724
It can be very painful.

00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,792
HIGGINS: You can't get
rid of it, which is why

00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:55,495
I feel like my guts
are on fire all the time.

00:12:55,562 --> 00:12:57,297
Well, do you need
medical attention?
No.

00:12:57,364 --> 00:12:59,733
Not at the moment.
Okay, then come with us.

00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:00,967
We have some
more questions.

00:13:01,034 --> 00:13:03,537
(groaning)

00:13:03,603 --> 00:13:05,205
Oh, Lily, God.

00:13:05,272 --> 00:13:08,408
(sniffling)

00:13:10,377 --> 00:13:13,346
A woman was attacked
and violently drowned
in his own bathroom

00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:15,282
and he says he slept
through the whole thing?

00:13:15,348 --> 00:13:17,717
Well, being connected
to a CPAP is kind of like

00:13:17,784 --> 00:13:19,386
being connected
to a ventilator.

00:13:19,452 --> 00:13:21,021
It's a noisy machine,
and it's a reasonable alibi.

00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:23,056
And Mr. Higgins knows a lot
about reasonable alibis.

00:13:23,123 --> 00:13:27,394
He's a big fan
of true crime.

00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:44,778
Compressed ethylene gas.

00:13:48,615 --> 00:13:50,217
(scoffs)

00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:51,551
Used book of matches.

00:13:51,618 --> 00:13:52,886
Somebody's been playing

00:13:52,953 --> 00:13:55,789
with fire.
Gee, I wonder who.

00:13:58,158 --> 00:14:02,028
Gnawed bones and trash
at the bottom of a barrel.

00:14:04,364 --> 00:14:07,601
Raccoon bait.

00:14:14,007 --> 00:14:15,408
Really?

00:14:35,195 --> 00:14:38,291
You know, I had a hat
like that when I was a kid.

00:14:38,358 --> 00:14:40,793
Except I wore it
on the back of my head.

00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,329
The other kids
would make fun of me

00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:45,431
and occasionally beat me up,
but I didn't care,

00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:46,766
'cause I was...

00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,269
♪ Davy, Davy Crockett ♪

00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:51,971
♪ King of the wild frontier ♪

00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:54,173
(cocking gun)
Hold it right there.
Geez!

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,408
I'll unload both
barrels on you

00:14:55,475 --> 00:14:56,676
and I'll turn you
into a pink mist.

00:14:56,743 --> 00:14:58,011
Don't you think I won't.

00:14:59,412 --> 00:15:01,181
Did you kill my friend?

00:15:02,248 --> 00:15:04,117
Well, I go away and come back.

00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:05,752
He's dead and you're here.

00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:06,953
Put that gun down

00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,155
on the floor.
And end up like Gomez?

00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:10,490
I don't think so.

00:15:10,557 --> 00:15:12,425
You think I'm crazy?
Calm down.

00:15:12,492 --> 00:15:14,417
Yes, please calm down.
You calm down!

00:15:14,484 --> 00:15:15,750
Hey, we're law enforcement.

00:15:15,817 --> 00:15:17,124
Put that gun down
right now!

00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,125
No!

00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:19,918
Look, you may get a shot off.

00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:23,088
You may even kill
my young friend there.

00:15:23,154 --> 00:15:26,525
But then I will
unload on you.

00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:27,993
I can't miss from here
and you don't wanna be

00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:29,594
dead, now, do you?

00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:32,130
You're a cop.

00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,532
That's right.

00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:36,134
Mystery solved, gentlemen,
courtesy of the A-Team--

00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,370
Whoa! Who the hell are you?!

00:15:38,436 --> 00:15:39,704
I just work in the lab.

00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:41,439
We're crime scene investigators.

00:15:41,506 --> 00:15:44,109
I'm gonna reach in my pocket
and I'm gonna show you my badge.

00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,644
Lookie here.

00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,812
See that?

00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,115
That's legit.

00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,683
There you go.
Nobody has to get hurt.

00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,051
Yeah, tell that to Gomez.

00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,853
Give me that shotgun.

00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,854
You all cops?

00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,689
STOKES:
Here you go.

00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:01,927
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
good man.

00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:07,632
Uh, sir, I think
we can explain

00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:09,634
what happened
to your friend.

00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:13,305
<i>You see, it looks like</i>
<i>he baited the pipe out back</i>

00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:16,675
<i>to lure the raccoons,</i>
<i>filled it with ethylene gas</i>

00:16:16,741 --> 00:16:21,646
<i>and then tried to ignite it.</i>

00:16:21,713 --> 00:16:24,216
HODGES: <i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>he didn't realize that</i>

00:16:24,282 --> 00:16:26,518
<i>the gas was pooling</i>
<i>at the bottom</i>

00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:29,387
<i>so, when he resorted</i>
<i>to other methods...</i>

00:16:29,454 --> 00:16:31,223
(chattering)
(gunshot)

00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:41,833
It was an accident.

00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,902
That's Raccoonzilla.

00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:47,205
In life, he and Gomez
was locked into a hatred

00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,508
that surpasseth understanding.

00:16:49,574 --> 00:16:52,511
Uh... Raccoonzilla?

00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:53,945
Well, that's the meanest,

00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:56,181
vilest rodent that ever
strode the planet.

00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,716
Technically, not a rodent.

00:16:57,782 --> 00:17:00,652
What?

00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:04,489
You're book-smart.

00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:13,231
Gomez...

00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,000
he was a good man.

00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:18,770
You kept to yourself,
but you always had a smile

00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,472
and a helping hand for others.

00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,208
You're gonna be missed.

00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:26,178
(sighing)

00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:28,413
I saw him alive
less than an hour ago.

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,482
How in the hell did you boys
get here so fast?

00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,783
We're off duty.

00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,084
We came for the ribs.

00:17:33,151 --> 00:17:34,286
And the hepatitis.

00:17:34,352 --> 00:17:35,554
What are you doing here?

00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,721
I'm the handyman.

00:17:36,788 --> 00:17:38,223
Well, I was the handyman.

00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,457
I'm the night watchman now.

00:17:39,524 --> 00:17:41,726
Do you have a car?
Uh-uh, no.

00:17:41,793 --> 00:17:42,727
A buddy dropped me off.
(car approaching)

00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:44,095
Somebody's coming.

00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:46,631
That'd be Shirley,
Harry's wife.

00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,066
Where is Harry anyway?

00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,035
I'd better let
Shirley tell you.

00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:52,671
(tires screeching, crashing)

00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:55,473
(sighing)

00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:04,182
Damn it all to hell!

00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,020
Who put that pig there?

00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:12,023
Who are these assclowns?

00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:27,295
Gomez was an artist.

00:18:27,362 --> 00:18:29,931
He was a genius with
the flesh of a pig.

00:18:29,998 --> 00:18:31,699
Kept all his

00:18:31,766 --> 00:18:34,269
recipes locked up secret
inside his head.

00:18:34,335 --> 00:18:37,472
Now, why did you have to go do
that to yourself, you dumbass?

00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:39,541
Now we are never gonna
get this place reopened.

00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:40,842
You can always
hire another chef.

00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:42,043
No...

00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:46,047
No one cooks swine
like Gomez did.

00:18:46,114 --> 00:18:47,649
He's the heartbeat
of this place.

00:18:47,715 --> 00:18:49,384
I thought Harry was.

00:18:49,451 --> 00:18:50,585
He was nothing
but the front man.

00:18:50,652 --> 00:18:52,687
Yeah, where is Harry?

00:18:52,754 --> 00:18:54,689
Bastard cleared out
the accounts,

00:18:54,756 --> 00:18:56,791
took off
six months ago.

00:18:56,858 --> 00:19:00,261
A month later,
Board of Health shut us down.

00:19:00,328 --> 00:19:01,396
Wouldn't surprise me

00:19:01,463 --> 00:19:03,298
if Harry had something
to do with that, too.

00:19:03,364 --> 00:19:06,434
If I ever catch up to him,
I'm gonna wring his ass dry.

00:19:06,501 --> 00:19:08,303
At least I've got

00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:09,437
the martini olives.

00:19:09,504 --> 00:19:12,140
So, Greg says
that the car is toast.

00:19:12,207 --> 00:19:14,943
And reeking of alcohol.

00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:17,612
I think that this is the same
broad that ran us off the road.

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,149
Yeah, that's what
we just said.

00:19:23,985 --> 00:19:26,187
All right, we gotta find a way
to get some backup out here.

00:19:26,254 --> 00:19:28,923
Hey, is there not a working
phone in here anywhere?

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:32,127
No.

00:19:32,193 --> 00:19:35,530
There's a ham radio
buried in the back.

00:19:37,732 --> 00:19:40,368
Keep an eye on her.

00:20:03,057 --> 00:20:04,559
(device beeps)

00:20:34,456 --> 00:20:36,758
That broken needle
in the victim's arm

00:20:36,825 --> 00:20:38,326
contained ketamine.

00:20:38,393 --> 00:20:40,495
Party drug.
Prelim tox
on the victim

00:20:40,562 --> 00:20:42,564
shows no traces of ketamine
in her system.

00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,366
<i>Maybe the party</i>
<i>hadn't gotten started.</i>

00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:49,304
According to your measurements,

00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,172
the fragment we extracted
from the victim

00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:53,208
was part of a 16-gauge needle.

00:20:53,274 --> 00:20:54,209
Right.

00:20:54,275 --> 00:20:55,410
The only needles we found

00:20:55,477 --> 00:20:56,711
at Bernard Higgins' house

00:20:56,778 --> 00:20:58,580
were 31-gauge.
He could've had
a different kit

00:20:58,646 --> 00:21:00,181
for his recreational stuff.

00:21:00,248 --> 00:21:01,883
What about this bloody
piece of metal

00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,052
that was found on the floor
under the recliner?

00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:06,321
It's high-grade
stainless steel,

00:21:06,387 --> 00:21:08,156
probably from a hand tool.

00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,791
Maybe scissors
or a pair of snips.

00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:11,726
I'm running the blood for DNA.

00:21:11,793 --> 00:21:13,628
Well, if it comes
back the vic's,

00:21:13,695 --> 00:21:16,431
Bernard's got a serious problem.

00:21:16,498 --> 00:21:17,999
You have to believe me.

00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:20,201
I would never hurt Lily.

00:21:20,268 --> 00:21:22,771
We, we loved each other.

00:21:22,837 --> 00:21:27,008
(sighs)
I wouldn't expect
a man like you to understand

00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:31,613
how this petite,
exquisite creature

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,784
could love a man like me,
but I...

00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:38,620
Our hearts touched.

00:21:38,686 --> 00:21:40,655
She used to call me...

00:21:40,722 --> 00:21:44,659
(speaking Mandarin)

00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:47,929
It's Mandarin
for "bountiful panda."

00:21:47,996 --> 00:21:49,230
Sounds a lot sexier in Mandarin.

00:21:49,297 --> 00:21:50,665
Listen,

00:21:50,732 --> 00:21:52,066
I'm just not seeing it that way.

00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:55,069
In fact, I think she came
to tell you that it was over.

00:21:55,136 --> 00:21:57,138
She was tired
of banging Sasquatch.

00:21:57,205 --> 00:21:58,706
So you kind of
got all jammed up.

00:21:58,773 --> 00:22:00,141
You roughed her up.

00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,609
You roofed her
with ketamine.

00:22:01,676 --> 00:22:02,777
That didn't work.

00:22:02,844 --> 00:22:04,412
She ran away.
She called 911.

00:22:04,479 --> 00:22:05,480
So you had to kill her.

00:22:05,547 --> 00:22:06,981
You've got it all wrong.

00:22:07,048 --> 00:22:08,917
I'm a very sick man.

00:22:15,523 --> 00:22:18,326

00:22:18,393 --> 00:22:20,995
Cut the crap, Bernie.
Come on.

00:22:21,062 --> 00:22:22,430
Sorry.

00:22:22,497 --> 00:22:24,399
I'm a narcoleptic.

00:22:24,466 --> 00:22:27,735
It's a very
serious disease.

00:22:27,802 --> 00:22:31,639
But it never stopped me from
making a success of myself.

00:22:31,706 --> 00:22:33,141
When I'm under stress,
it gets worse.

00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,443
Tell me about
the beautiful friend Lily.

00:22:36,978 --> 00:22:39,581
She comes to Vegas once
in a while on a layover.

00:22:39,647 --> 00:22:40,982
Oh.

00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:43,752
She was an international
flight attendant.

00:22:43,818 --> 00:22:47,255
And, yes, all right,
I would pay her expenses

00:22:47,322 --> 00:22:48,389
when she was in town.

00:22:48,456 --> 00:22:51,659

my patience a little bit.

believe me, all right?

00:23:07,242 --> 00:23:08,877
I can't sleep.

00:23:18,753 --> 00:23:20,889
Hey. Bountiful!

Ooh.

00:23:31,499 --> 00:23:35,970
There's a radio
here somewhere.

00:23:36,037 --> 00:23:37,472
I know that, uh...

Lift it up...

No radio in there.

00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,996
I-I wouldn't go in there,
if I was you.

00:24:13,842 --> 00:24:16,044
You don't move, Slick.

00:24:16,111 --> 00:24:17,479
I mean it. Just freeze.

00:24:17,545 --> 00:24:19,214
I'm froze.

00:24:39,934 --> 00:24:41,236
Yeah, yeah.

00:24:41,302 --> 00:24:45,940
Harry used to make Shirley
give first-timers the tour.

00:24:46,007 --> 00:24:47,809
Never failed to scare
the crap out of them.

00:24:47,876 --> 00:24:49,277
Should've seen
the look on your face.

00:24:49,344 --> 00:24:50,445
Yeah, you got me.

00:24:50,512 --> 00:24:52,981
Eh, that's the kind
of guy Harry was.

00:24:53,047 --> 00:24:54,783
Always good
for a laugh.

00:24:54,849 --> 00:24:57,018
Yeah, let's find that radio.

00:24:57,085 --> 00:25:00,255
You think I don't know what
you see when you look at us?

00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:02,924
Bunch of ignorant,
drunk crackers.

Shiftless peckerwoods.

00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,961
Let me tell you something.

00:25:07,028 --> 00:25:08,730
We built this place
out of nothing

00:25:08,797 --> 00:25:11,800
with our hands and our sweat
and our determination.

00:25:11,866 --> 00:25:14,702
Mayor of Vegas
used to eat here.

00:25:14,769 --> 00:25:17,372
All right-- if I can't find a
phone, I'm going to make one.

00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:19,374
Keep an eye on her.

00:25:19,441 --> 00:25:22,110
We had politicians, celebrities,

00:25:22,177 --> 00:25:24,679
rubbing up elbows
with the common man.

00:25:24,746 --> 00:25:29,484
Some nights, we had eight, ten
limos stacked out up front.

00:25:29,551 --> 00:25:31,186
Then Harry took off.

00:25:32,554 --> 00:25:34,789
(whispers):
All went to hell.

00:25:34,856 --> 00:25:36,324
He didn't care who he hurt.

00:25:36,391 --> 00:25:40,829
Are you sure, though,
that I can't fix you
boys one of these?

00:25:40,895 --> 00:25:43,631
You know, uh, I could use
a little boys' room.

00:25:43,698 --> 00:25:45,266
Yeah. Yeah.
Toilets is all stuffed up.

00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:46,568
There's one in the basement.

00:25:46,634 --> 00:25:50,872
But you don't want
to use that one, believe me.

You know, you just puff up

00:32:22,622 --> 00:32:25,391
This should all be
cleared up soon.

00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:26,459
It's a good thing, too.

00:32:26,525 --> 00:32:28,461
That guy is getting pretty ripe.

00:32:28,527 --> 00:32:31,664
I'm sure, he wasn't too good
in real life either, but now...

00:32:33,466 --> 00:32:34,600
(sniffing)

00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:36,636
I need to wash up.

00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:40,873
HODGES:
Hey, see if you can find
an air freshener.

00:32:46,546 --> 00:32:47,580
(clattering, glass shattering)

00:32:47,647 --> 00:32:49,882
Aah! Oh, my God!

00:32:49,949 --> 00:32:51,183
What happened?
Aah!

00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,219
It's sulfuric acid! Aah!

00:32:53,286 --> 00:32:55,254
All right, put your hand
under cold water.

00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:56,322
(groaning)

00:32:56,389 --> 00:32:59,358
(Andrews groaning
in pain)

00:32:59,425 --> 00:33:00,860
Ow! Aah!

00:33:02,161 --> 00:33:03,195
Here, here.

00:33:03,262 --> 00:33:04,530
The charcoal will
neutralize the acid.

00:33:06,132 --> 00:33:07,667
(sighs loudly)

00:33:07,733 --> 00:33:09,468
Yeah. Ah.

00:33:09,535 --> 00:33:11,537
(Andrews groaning)

00:33:13,205 --> 00:33:15,174
ANDREWS:
More. More charcoal!

00:33:15,241 --> 00:33:16,576
SANDERS:
Just keep it underwater.

00:33:16,642 --> 00:33:17,777
(Andrews groans)

00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,216
Whoa!

00:33:23,282 --> 00:33:25,351
What do we
have here?

00:33:25,418 --> 00:33:26,953
Check it out, guys.

00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,724
Y'all want to tell me

00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:33,025
who this is?

00:33:33,092 --> 00:33:34,327
Who?

00:33:34,393 --> 00:33:36,362
Well, I don't know.

00:33:36,429 --> 00:33:37,997
You tell me, Shirley.

00:33:38,064 --> 00:33:40,266
I got no idea.

00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:41,968
Slick?

00:33:42,034 --> 00:33:43,002
I don't know.

00:33:43,069 --> 00:33:45,338
(sirens approaching)

00:33:45,404 --> 00:33:47,773
You know what?
That's okay.

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,176
Just sit tight.

00:33:50,243 --> 00:33:52,011
(cocks gun)

00:33:52,078 --> 00:33:53,946
We're gonna figure this out.

00:33:54,013 --> 00:33:57,083
LANGSTON:
<i>All right, the sutures</i>
<i>had started to dissolve,</i>

00:33:57,149 --> 00:33:59,185
which means
that the septic appendix

00:33:59,252 --> 00:34:03,389
was inserted into his body
about four to seven days ago.

00:34:07,827 --> 00:34:10,429
<i>The blood on</i>
<i>the piece of steel I found</i>

00:34:10,496 --> 00:34:12,231
<i>was not Lily's;</i>
<i>it was Bernie's,</i>

00:34:12,298 --> 00:34:14,934
<i>and it was most likely from</i>
<i>a laparoscopic scissor.</i>

00:34:20,806 --> 00:34:23,109
Dr. Jekyll has moved on
to living victims, Catherine.

00:34:23,175 --> 00:34:24,844
He is escalating.

00:34:26,846 --> 00:34:27,914
Okay.

00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,216
Joseph Bigelow,
about two months ago,

00:34:30,283 --> 00:34:33,319
was found with his intestines
tied into a bow.

00:34:33,386 --> 00:34:35,054
Operated on postmortem.

00:34:35,121 --> 00:34:37,089
What does he have in common
with Bernard Higgins?

00:34:37,156 --> 00:34:38,291
Joseph Bigelow:

00:34:38,357 --> 00:34:40,993
lounge piano player,
homeless.

00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,131
Bernard Higgins:
self-help real estate guru.

00:34:45,197 --> 00:34:47,400
Different ages,
different social circles,

00:34:47,466 --> 00:34:49,235
different
physical types.

00:34:49,302 --> 00:34:50,803
Nothing leaps to mind.

00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:53,072
We'll run DNA
on the septic appendix.

00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:55,575
If the donor's in CODIS,
it might give us a lead.

00:34:55,641 --> 00:34:56,742
We can check hospital records...

00:34:56,809 --> 00:34:58,511
There are almost
200 appendectomies

00:34:58,578 --> 00:35:01,080
that are performed
in Las Vegas every month.

00:35:01,147 --> 00:35:02,848
If the appendix
was stored

00:35:02,915 --> 00:35:05,084
in formaldehyde
and flushed prior to surgery,

00:35:05,151 --> 00:35:06,953
it could've been in storage
for years.

00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:09,488
Right, which means it could've
come from just about anywhere.

00:35:09,555 --> 00:35:12,291
Bernie was a narcoleptic,

00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:13,859
the perfect victim for a surgeon

00:35:13,926 --> 00:35:16,596
who doesn't want his patients to
know they'd been operated on.

00:35:16,662 --> 00:35:17,830
Right.

00:35:17,897 --> 00:35:19,398
WILLOWS:
And Jekyll performed

00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:21,367
the surgery
in Bernie's home.

00:35:21,434 --> 00:35:24,503
All of which suggests
that Jekyll knew him.

00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:26,973
But maybe not as well
as he thought.

00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:29,075
Bernie was so full of meds

00:35:29,141 --> 00:35:32,478
that I suspect
the appendix didn't kill him

00:35:32,545 --> 00:35:34,413
as quickly as Jekyll planned.

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,084
Well, say Jekyll saw Bernie
somewhere, up and about,

00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,186
<i>after</i> he was supposed
to be dead.

00:35:40,253 --> 00:35:41,621
Wouldn't that piss him off?

00:35:41,687 --> 00:35:42,989
And like many serial killers,

00:35:43,055 --> 00:35:45,591
it might have compelled him
to finish what he started.

00:35:45,658 --> 00:35:47,226
So Jekyll goes back
to the house,

00:35:47,293 --> 00:35:48,394
packing ketamine to subdue

00:35:48,461 --> 00:35:50,863
Bernie, and he
surprises Lily.

00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:53,399
LANGSTON:
<i>She runs. She calls 911.</i>

00:35:53,466 --> 00:35:56,869
<i>He chases her,</i>
<i>tries to inject her, but fails.</i>

00:35:56,936 --> 00:35:58,304
<i>He hears the sirens,</i>

00:35:58,371 --> 00:36:01,040
<i>and he leaves before</i>
<i>he can finish Bernie off.</i>

00:36:01,107 --> 00:36:05,077
And all we have of him, maybe,
is a size 13 shoe.

00:36:05,144 --> 00:36:06,412
LANGSTON:
Well, if Bernie
and Jekyll

00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:07,947
did know each other,
then maybe there's

00:36:08,014 --> 00:36:10,316
something that connects them
back at the house.

00:36:21,876 --> 00:36:23,744
PHILLIPS:
Poor guy.

00:36:23,811 --> 00:36:25,046
SANDERS:
Gomez?

00:36:25,112 --> 00:36:27,114
I meant the raccoon.

00:36:29,617 --> 00:36:33,955
I got Harry's medical records
and dental X-rays here.

00:36:34,021 --> 00:36:36,424
Number three, M.O.L. amalgam.

00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,993
Number 30, full gold crown.

00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,896
You know, I'm no
forensic odontologist,

00:36:41,963 --> 00:36:43,164
but that's Harry.

00:36:43,231 --> 00:36:44,765
You will be missed.

00:36:44,832 --> 00:36:46,067
Not by pigs.

00:36:46,133 --> 00:36:48,636
Look what we got here.

00:36:48,703 --> 00:36:52,506
Gomez has got a record.

00:36:52,573 --> 00:36:56,277
SANDERS:
Busted for forgery
in San Antonio 13 years ago.

00:36:56,344 --> 00:36:58,379
Jumped bail
while awaiting trial.

00:36:58,446 --> 00:36:59,814
Whereabouts unknown.

00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:01,015
Until now.

00:37:01,082 --> 00:37:03,084
A little help?

00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:07,421
(grunting)

00:37:07,488 --> 00:37:10,258
Oh! Oh.

00:37:11,259 --> 00:37:14,362
Oh, way to go, little guy.

00:37:20,501 --> 00:37:22,303
This guy's ribs
are completely missing.

00:37:23,571 --> 00:37:25,339
It looks like they were cut

00:37:25,406 --> 00:37:28,009
along the sternum
and spine.

00:37:30,044 --> 00:37:33,314
The restaurant was closed,
due to a hepatitis outbreak,

00:37:33,381 --> 00:37:35,449
a month after
Harry disappeared.

00:37:37,852 --> 00:37:40,555
Harry had hepatitis B.

00:37:40,621 --> 00:37:44,292
Which has an incubation period
of roughly four weeks.

00:37:44,358 --> 00:37:45,860
You know what that means,
don't you?

00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,609
(man laughing, chattering)

00:38:04,845 --> 00:38:08,649
Mmm. I have always
loved Harry's ribs.

00:38:08,716 --> 00:38:10,184
Where is Harry tonight?

00:38:10,251 --> 00:38:11,819
You know, honey,

00:38:11,886 --> 00:38:14,322
I'm not sure
where he got off to.

00:38:14,388 --> 00:38:16,657
I'm sure he's here in spirit.

00:38:16,724 --> 00:38:18,960
I just can't believe
Harry's dead.

00:38:20,328 --> 00:38:21,896
I never killed nobody.

00:38:21,963 --> 00:38:23,598
I ain't that kind of woman.

00:38:23,664 --> 00:38:26,667
Anyway, I loved the man
until the day he disappeared.

00:38:27,668 --> 00:38:31,305
Now, if you ask me...

00:38:31,372 --> 00:38:32,840
it was Slick.

00:38:32,907 --> 00:38:34,709
Now, why would he
do that?

00:38:34,775 --> 00:38:38,813
'Cause... before Harry
came to town, I was...

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,081
You was what?

00:38:40,147 --> 00:38:42,183
Slick's fiancée.

00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,718
Oh.

00:38:43,784 --> 00:38:45,353
Harry swept me
off my feet.

00:38:45,419 --> 00:38:47,889
I am not proud
of what I did.

00:38:47,955 --> 00:38:49,223
So you dumped Slick for Harry?

00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:50,391
Yes, sir.

00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:53,528
I broke Slick's heart.

00:38:53,594 --> 00:38:55,263
And then,
after Harry disappeared,

00:38:55,329 --> 00:38:58,165
I was in the vulnerable state,
and Slick forgave me.

00:38:58,232 --> 00:39:01,702
He took me back, but I think
that he bumped Harry off,

00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:03,371
get him out of the way,

00:39:03,437 --> 00:39:06,541
so he could have me all
to his self once again.

00:39:06,607 --> 00:39:08,175
What man wouldn't?

00:39:11,312 --> 00:39:13,080
I'm not one
to cast aspersions,

00:39:13,147 --> 00:39:15,716
but Harry and Shirley were
at each other's throats

00:39:15,783 --> 00:39:17,718
night and day.

00:39:17,785 --> 00:39:20,388
Shirley's what
you might call a, uh, uh, uh...

00:39:20,454 --> 00:39:23,090
a first-class bitch on wheels.

00:39:23,157 --> 00:39:27,094
She told me she dumped you
and ran off with Harry

00:39:27,161 --> 00:39:28,663
and broke your heart.

00:39:28,729 --> 00:39:30,598
She said that?

00:39:30,665 --> 00:39:32,166
Yeah.

00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:34,268
I'm the one kicked
that tramp out,

00:39:34,335 --> 00:39:37,138
and she went crawling
on her belly back to Harry.

00:39:37,205 --> 00:39:39,674
Oh, she spun her feminine wiles,

00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,743
but he grew... he grew wise
to her trampy ways.

00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:45,179
You know,
I thought he got out

00:39:45,246 --> 00:39:46,614
while the getting was good,

00:39:46,681 --> 00:39:48,716
but I will bet you
dollars to donuts,

00:39:48,783 --> 00:39:51,586
it was that whore
that barbecued his ass.

00:39:51,652 --> 00:39:54,155
STOKES:
<i>They both had motive,</i>

00:39:54,222 --> 00:39:56,524
and they're both accusing
each other of killing Harry.

00:39:56,591 --> 00:39:58,059
So far, we have
no evidence

00:39:58,125 --> 00:40:00,061
that suggests either
of them actually did it.

00:40:00,127 --> 00:40:02,597
Could be either one
or both,

00:40:02,663 --> 00:40:05,766
or-- <i>or--</i> it could be
somebody else altogether.

00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:08,669
(groans) My money is
on someone else altogether.

00:40:08,736 --> 00:40:09,871
Hey, Hop-Along.

00:40:09,937 --> 00:40:11,272
What do you got there?

00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:14,609
A postcard Harry sent Shirley
<i>after</i> he was dead,

00:40:14,675 --> 00:40:17,845
which is why I had Mandy
print it-- and get this:

00:40:17,912 --> 00:40:21,682
She got a hit for Gomez's
mother, a 60-year-old

00:40:21,749 --> 00:40:24,619
truck-stop hooker in Boca Raton.

00:40:24,685 --> 00:40:26,454
So I ran the handwriting
through Q.D.

00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,889
It was an excellent forgery.

00:40:27,955 --> 00:40:30,458
It was good enough
to fool Shirley, kite a check

00:40:30,525 --> 00:40:31,692
and empty
their bank accounts.

00:40:31,759 --> 00:40:33,127
But, wait,
where did you get...

00:40:33,194 --> 00:40:34,962
An exemplar of
Harry's handwriting?

00:40:35,029 --> 00:40:36,130
From his bank.

00:40:36,197 --> 00:40:37,865
Time out. Let me
get this straight.

00:40:37,932 --> 00:40:39,500
Gomez, a convicted forger,

00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:41,302
wrote the postcard,
sent it

00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:42,603
to his mother,
who then mailed it back

00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,905
to Shirley all the way
from Florida?

00:40:43,971 --> 00:40:45,072
Yes! See,

00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:46,340
it's a deliberate attempt

00:40:46,407 --> 00:40:48,142
to obscure the details
of Harry's death.

00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:51,178
See, I think Shirley really
believed Harry ran out on her.

00:40:51,245 --> 00:40:52,780
But why?
Why would Gomez...

00:40:52,847 --> 00:40:54,582
Kill Harry?
Yeah.

00:40:54,649 --> 00:40:55,750
I don't know.

00:40:55,816 --> 00:40:57,885
I bet Harry knew
Gomez was on the lam,

00:40:57,952 --> 00:41:00,254
and was using it to keep him
under his thumb.

00:41:00,321 --> 00:41:04,225
STOKES:
<i>One day Gomez just</i>
<i>got sick and tired of it.</i>

00:41:07,795 --> 00:41:09,664
Huh.

00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,999
You know, this birthday
didn't suck after all.

00:41:12,066 --> 00:41:13,301
(laughs)

00:41:13,367 --> 00:41:14,669
Oh! Aah!

00:41:14,735 --> 00:41:17,171
Ow.

00:41:19,574 --> 00:41:21,509
WILLOWS:
<i>We got Bernie's</i>

00:41:21,576 --> 00:41:24,312
computers, Rolodex and
personal correspondence.

00:41:24,378 --> 00:41:26,914
Everything that we collected
will go into storage, in case...

00:41:26,981 --> 00:41:28,916
In case Jekyll
strikes again?

00:41:28,983 --> 00:41:30,484
He will, you know.

00:41:30,551 --> 00:41:32,253
Well, this is what's
been bugging me.

00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,921
With Joey Bigelow,

00:41:33,988 --> 00:41:36,357
Jekyll took
the man's bow tie

00:41:36,424 --> 00:41:38,926
and then left another
bow tie, so to speak,

00:41:38,993 --> 00:41:40,328
inside his body.

00:41:40,394 --> 00:41:43,931
But with Bernie, Jekyll
gave him another appendix.

00:41:43,998 --> 00:41:46,200
I'm just wondering,
what did he take?
