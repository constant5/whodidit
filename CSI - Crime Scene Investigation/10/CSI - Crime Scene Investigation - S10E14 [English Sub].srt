check for faulty wiring
in this building.

00:08:59,362 --> 00:09:01,431
I do a shock test

00:09:01,498 --> 00:09:03,934
Oh, okay.
Yeah, that's
why the wiring

got to be jacked.

00:09:06,002 --> 00:09:10,473
It fried most of our wireless
equipment before the show,

00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,642
and that's why
we had to cable Jay.

00:09:30,527 --> 00:09:31,895

they're cops.

00:09:42,272 --> 00:09:45,175
Jay's injuries are not
consistent with an accident.

00:09:45,242 --> 00:09:46,710
What are they consistent with?

00:09:46,776 --> 00:09:48,545
Intentional electrocution.

00:09:48,612 --> 00:09:50,046
You're saying
that somebody actually

00:09:50,113 --> 00:09:51,648
tried to hurt Jay on purpose?

00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:53,617
Why don't you tell us
about the fight you guys had?

00:09:53,683 --> 00:09:55,285
I mean, what's there to tell?
Families fight.

00:09:55,352 --> 00:09:56,453
That's just something
that happens.

00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,256
<i>You know, at least once a tour.</i>

00:09:59,322 --> 00:10:00,624
(grunts)

00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,292
<i>It's no big deal.</i>

00:10:04,494 --> 00:10:06,596
And did you have one of
those fights last night?

00:10:06,663 --> 00:10:08,198
That's none of your business.

00:10:08,265 --> 00:10:09,666
Well, I'm making it
my business, how about that?

00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:10,901
WILLOWS:
All right,

00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:12,536
uh...

00:10:12,602 --> 00:10:15,238
Joe Don, why don't you tell us?

00:10:15,305 --> 00:10:18,141
Well, uh, Jay wants to do
his own project, you know?

00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,809
He told us, uh,
he wanted to take

00:10:19,876 --> 00:10:22,946
a little time away from the band
and threw it on us last night.

00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:26,349
And we didn't think it was very
cool, so we tried to kill him.

00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,084
Dude, they're cops.

00:10:29,219 --> 00:10:32,322
Okay, how about you give us
Jay's equipment?

00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:34,191
Uh...
Yes, yes.

00:10:34,257 --> 00:10:35,358
You give these folks
whatever they need

00:10:35,425 --> 00:10:36,526
and none of your damn lip.

00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:38,662
Buddy, lighten up a little bit.

00:10:38,728 --> 00:10:39,896
You know what,
we're all Rascal Flatts here,

00:10:39,963 --> 00:10:41,765
you know, even though
Jay can't remember.

00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:48,038
COD?

00:10:48,104 --> 00:10:50,440
Got a laundry list
of what didn't kill him.

00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:53,743
No water on the lungs,
no water on the stomach.

00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,978
He didn't drown.

00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:58,415
Head wound was severe
but not fatal.

00:11:02,285 --> 00:11:03,253
This man had cancer.

00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,222
Prostate, stage four.

00:11:05,288 --> 00:11:06,690
It migrated

00:11:06,756 --> 00:11:08,291
to his liver,
colon and stomach.

00:11:08,358 --> 00:11:09,693
But it's not COD.

00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:11,661
Nope, it's undetermined
pending tox.

00:11:11,728 --> 00:11:13,964
Let's start clipping.

00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,164
♪ ♪

00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:00,944
HODGES:
My father liked to fish.

00:12:01,978 --> 00:12:03,780
he never took
me with him.

00:12:03,847 --> 00:12:06,383
Maybe he felt
you were crowding him.

00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:09,085
Hmm, not true.

00:12:09,152 --> 00:12:11,788
I think he just liked
his alone time.

00:12:12,823 --> 00:12:15,458
My mother and I
would bake cookies.

00:12:16,493 --> 00:12:18,328
Your father ever
take you fishing?

00:12:18,395 --> 00:12:20,263
Fishing?

00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,865
No.

00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:26,736
Hey, head wound
wasn't accidental.

00:12:26,803 --> 00:12:28,405
Gravitational
blood on the shirt

00:12:28,471 --> 00:12:30,273
indicates that he was standing
when he was hit.

00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,108
(grunts)

00:12:32,175 --> 00:12:34,177
(groans)

00:12:35,745 --> 00:12:37,881
<i>There was no blood</i>
<i>on the outside of the vest,</i>

00:12:37,948 --> 00:12:39,616
<i>only transfer on the inside.</i>

00:12:39,683 --> 00:12:41,451
He was dressed after the event.

00:12:41,518 --> 00:12:44,788
Someone wants us to think
it was an accident.

00:12:44,855 --> 00:12:47,557
(phone ringing)

00:12:49,893 --> 00:12:51,361
Willows.

00:12:51,428 --> 00:12:53,096
It's Craig Halliday.

00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:57,200
Associate Director,
Central Intelligence Agency.

00:12:57,267 --> 00:12:59,970
That's right, CIA.

00:13:00,036 --> 00:13:01,505
I heard the pause.

00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:05,242
Listen, I'm sitting here
in my office,

00:13:05,308 --> 00:13:08,478
and I just happened to notice
that CSI Raymond Langston

00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:10,780
is running the fingerprints

00:13:10,847 --> 00:13:14,284
of former deputy director
of operations Vance Colton.

00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:16,086
(chuckling)

00:13:16,152 --> 00:13:18,822
That old goat didn't get caught
with trick dice, did he?

00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:21,191
Before I give you
any information,

00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,826
I'll need to verify
your identity.

00:13:22,893 --> 00:13:24,227
Good job.

00:13:24,294 --> 00:13:26,396
You'd be surprised
how many people don't ask.

00:13:26,463 --> 00:13:27,731
You call Langley,

00:13:27,797 --> 00:13:29,065
they'll route you through to me.

00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:30,734
Headquarters is expecting
your call.

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,968
(dial tone)

00:13:36,406 --> 00:13:37,908
(cell phone ringing)

00:13:37,974 --> 00:13:39,075
(phone beeps on)

00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:41,578
Hi, Catherine.

00:13:41,645 --> 00:13:43,680
So, you were saying?

00:13:43,747 --> 00:13:45,749
My team is investigating
a floater

00:13:45,815 --> 00:13:47,184
recovered from Lake Mead

00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,652
early this morning.

00:13:48,718 --> 00:13:50,353
A floater, huh?

00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,521
Like a dead fish?

00:13:51,588 --> 00:13:52,756
As in a dead human being.

00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:55,225
Male Caucasian, 70s.

00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,927
Does that sound
like your Vance Colton?

00:13:56,993 --> 00:13:59,696
Well, Catherine,
this falls under

00:13:59,763 --> 00:14:02,232
National Security protocols,
meaning I'm taking the body

00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:05,569
and all logs, reports, evidence

00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:07,904
and whatnot
that your team has collected.

00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:11,308
If the victim
is Deputy Director Colton,

00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:14,578
his body is the property
of the Clark County coroner.

00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:16,279
You will need to contact them.

00:14:16,346 --> 00:14:19,516
As for the "whatnot," you'll
need to put it in writing to me.

00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,917
(laughing)

00:14:20,984 --> 00:14:23,086
Whoa, there, yikes.

00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:27,190
Uh, Catherine, I'm not trying
to dance on anybody's feet here.

00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:29,960
How about a collaboration?

00:14:30,026 --> 00:14:32,562
In exchange
for helping your government,

00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:36,066
how about I give you something
you won't get otherwise?

00:14:41,938 --> 00:14:46,610
I've seen access denied,
but access restricted?

00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:48,545
Denied is "get
lost."

00:14:48,612 --> 00:14:52,549
Restricted-- that's like
a fence you want to climb over.

00:14:52,616 --> 00:14:56,052
That fence surrounds the CIA.

00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:58,488
Your floater's name
is Vance Colton.

00:14:58,555 --> 00:15:00,690
That would explain
the pocket full of memories.

00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:03,760
SIDLE:
Oh, here he is.

00:15:03,827 --> 00:15:06,630
Vance Colton,
Deputy Director of Operations.

00:15:06,696 --> 00:15:11,668
Central Intelligence Agency,
1976 to 1983.

00:15:11,735 --> 00:15:13,537
"As Deputy Director,

00:15:13,603 --> 00:15:16,907
"he oversaw covert operations
on four continents.

00:15:16,973 --> 00:15:19,910
"High point of his career
was Operation Blackwood.

00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:22,846
"Colton conceived
and successfully conducted

00:15:22,913 --> 00:15:26,816
Operation Blackwood
against the East German Stasi."

00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:28,285
East German Stasi?

00:15:28,351 --> 00:15:29,452
Bad guys.

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,854
Well, the CIA

00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:33,690
is taking the body
and all our evidence, so...

00:15:33,757 --> 00:15:35,892
we made copies
of everything.

00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:37,460
Do we get anything in return?

00:15:37,527 --> 00:15:40,297
Colton's home address.

00:15:40,363 --> 00:15:42,399
And maybe the primary.

00:15:45,735 --> 00:15:49,039
(buzzing)

00:15:49,105 --> 00:15:50,707
Put down the saw!

00:15:50,774 --> 00:15:52,876
(motor winding down)

00:15:52,943 --> 00:15:54,778
Step away from
the guitar.

00:15:54,845 --> 00:15:57,447
You were about to commit murder

00:15:57,514 --> 00:16:00,684
on an immaculate '62 Fender
jazz bass with the original

00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,320
factory paint.
So, what?

00:16:03,386 --> 00:16:05,188
For someone from the
great state of Texas,

00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:08,892
you show very little respect
for a true American art form.

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,260
Hey, just 'cause I'm from Texas

00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:12,062
doesn't mean
I like country music.

00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:14,231
This, Nick, is a
solid body guitar.

00:16:14,297 --> 00:16:16,466
Do you mind?
Please.

00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:18,702
What you see is what you get.

00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:20,537
(sensor beeps intermittently)

00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,306
You ever hear of the Yardbirds?

00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:26,009
Oh, come on, Clapton,
Page, Beck, Relf?

00:16:26,076 --> 00:16:27,344
Of course I have.

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,712
Back in 1976,

00:16:28,778 --> 00:16:32,883
(sensor beeps)
practicing for a reunion
in his basement,

00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:36,386
Keith Relf did not properly
ground his guitar,

00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,088
and he killed himself.

00:16:38,154 --> 00:16:41,391
If this guitar was sabotaged,
we'd see shaved wires.

00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,895
Well, if it was just a short,
these two pot resistors

00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:47,998
would show residue
from the ozone flash.

00:16:48,064 --> 00:16:49,833
There's not even any burned skin

00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,068
to the strings.

00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:53,837
I think we're doing

00:16:53,904 --> 00:16:55,438
a guitar-topsy on the
wrong guitar, buddy.

00:16:55,505 --> 00:16:59,476
One of those Rascal Flatts boys
is jerking us around.

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,037
Dr. Langston.

00:17:27,103 --> 00:17:29,573
And, uh,
Catherine?
Sara.

00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:31,975
Sidle.
Oh, CSI three,
and a very good one.

00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:33,577
Craig Halliday,

00:17:33,643 --> 00:17:35,412
Associate Director, CIA,
but you know that.

00:17:35,478 --> 00:17:37,047
And how do you know me?

00:17:37,113 --> 00:17:39,583
Sorry. They beat it into us
from day one of training.

00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:42,152
You never meet any stranger
you don't already know.

00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:43,553
Agent Halliday...
Actually,

00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,256
we recruit agents;
we're called officers.

00:17:46,323 --> 00:17:47,457
Your officers

00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,126
are corrupting
a potential crime scene.

00:17:50,193 --> 00:17:53,563
Catherine told me
DDO Colton drowned.

00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,931
She didn't tell you that.

00:17:54,998 --> 00:17:58,134
We are investigating his death
as a probable homicide.

00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:00,837
Aw, hell.

00:18:00,904 --> 00:18:04,708
Oh... offer a favor
and I screw it up, huh?

00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:07,511
You can fix it
by pulling back your officers.

00:18:07,577 --> 00:18:09,846
Well, I would if I could,

00:18:09,913 --> 00:18:12,782
but you see,
federal statute demands

00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:15,519
that any investigation
of the death of one of our own,

00:18:15,585 --> 00:18:18,555
the crime scene be turned over
to the agency for 24 hours

00:18:18,622 --> 00:18:20,524
in order to secure
any and all whatnot

00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,492
pertaining to National Security.

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,295
But 24 hours is for slowpokes.

00:18:25,362 --> 00:18:28,398
I'm out of your way
in less than two.

00:18:35,205 --> 00:18:37,941
Since when is a mattress
National Security?

00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,514
(camera shutter clicking)

00:18:49,873 --> 00:18:53,676
Travis, why'd you give
the man the wrong guitar?

00:18:53,743 --> 00:18:55,712
I gave him the guitar case.

00:18:55,779 --> 00:18:58,848
I-I thought Jay's bass was in it
because I put it there

00:18:58,915 --> 00:19:00,917
after I finished playing
with y'all.

00:19:00,984 --> 00:19:04,821
Okay, so which one
of these shocked him?

00:19:04,888 --> 00:19:05,955
None of them.

00:19:06,022 --> 00:19:08,191
I put that one in the case.

00:19:08,258 --> 00:19:10,593
Okay, so where is Jay's guitar?

00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,128
Is it missing or what?

00:19:12,195 --> 00:19:14,030
I don't know what to tell you.

00:19:14,097 --> 00:19:15,398
Well, you better
tell me something.

00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:18,468
You know, this is

00:19:18,535 --> 00:19:20,837
starting to look a lot like
a conspiracy to me, fellas.

00:19:20,904 --> 00:19:23,173
Don't look at me like that.

00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:24,808
Like what?
I'm not even looking

00:19:24,874 --> 00:19:26,209
at you, man.
Yeah, then why am I sweating?

00:19:26,276 --> 00:19:28,411
You tell me.
Look, our security team

00:19:28,478 --> 00:19:30,814
would've stopped somebody
leaving with Jay's guitar.

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,484
Look, guys, if you want
to can me, I get it.

00:19:34,551 --> 00:19:35,985
You're not
going anywhere.

00:19:36,052 --> 00:19:37,854
We got a concert tonight and Jay
still doesn't know who he is.

00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:39,656
Look, we have no show
without Jay.

00:19:39,722 --> 00:19:41,257
Figure it out, boys.

00:19:41,324 --> 00:19:43,193
I'm going to talk
to security.

00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:53,102
I wonder what this
place would look like

00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:55,271
if they weren't
cooperating with us.

00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:56,873
If Vance Colton was murdered,

00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,077
why would the CIA
want to cover it up?

00:20:01,144 --> 00:20:03,513
Maybe they were looking
for something

00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,415
here in the house.

00:20:05,482 --> 00:20:06,916
Something...

00:20:06,983 --> 00:20:09,853
they thought
the killer was after.

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,122
If they were looking
for something specific,

00:20:12,188 --> 00:20:14,390
why not just take it?

00:20:14,457 --> 00:20:15,992
I mean, we would
never know.

00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:17,527
They took everything.

00:20:17,594 --> 00:20:21,030
They either didn't know
what they were looking for,

00:20:21,097 --> 00:20:24,167
or they didn't want anyone
to know what they were taking.

00:20:34,511 --> 00:20:37,614
LANGSTON:
One canoe missing,
one paddle missing.

00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,916
Colton was dressed
to go out on the water.

00:20:39,983 --> 00:20:42,252
Could be the primary.

00:20:42,318 --> 00:20:44,120
Freshly split logs,

00:20:44,187 --> 00:20:45,655
no axe.

00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:47,390
Got green-painted

00:20:47,457 --> 00:20:50,460
plastic fragments,
possibly polyethylene.

00:20:50,527 --> 00:20:53,263
Same color and composition
as these two canoes.

00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:58,268
If these are from
the missing canoe,

00:20:58,334 --> 00:20:59,969
then it has a hole in it.

00:21:00,036 --> 00:21:01,070
(tapping)

00:21:01,137 --> 00:21:03,673
An ax could put
a hole in this,

00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,341
in which case both the ax

00:21:05,408 --> 00:21:07,844
and the canoe are probably
at the bottom of the lake.

00:21:07,911 --> 00:21:09,946
Maybe not, actually.

00:21:10,013 --> 00:21:13,183
Canoes today are made with
flotation devices on each end.

00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:15,185
Grissom and I take canoe trips.

00:21:15,251 --> 00:21:17,353
We went looking for bugs
in a canoe on our honeymoon.

00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,721
(clears throat)

00:21:18,788 --> 00:21:20,190
Uh, point is

00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,692
that, um, canoes today
don't always sink.

00:21:26,196 --> 00:21:27,764
I got drag marks here.

00:21:27,831 --> 00:21:31,134
Green paint transfer.

00:21:31,201 --> 00:21:32,969
(spraying)

00:21:33,036 --> 00:21:34,838
Why would a guy like Colton

00:21:34,904 --> 00:21:37,307
drag his canoe to the dock
every time he used it?

00:21:37,373 --> 00:21:40,276
And if he did do that,
wouldn't there be

00:21:40,343 --> 00:21:41,711
a lot more drag
marks here?

00:21:45,415 --> 00:21:48,151
(spraying)

00:21:48,218 --> 00:21:50,553
Negative.

00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,957
All right, what if Colton

00:21:54,023 --> 00:21:57,460
was in the canoe before
it was dragged to the water?

00:22:02,165 --> 00:22:05,401
SIDLE:
<i>Killer launches him</i>
<i>from the dock,</i>

00:22:05,468 --> 00:22:10,974
<i>assuming that he'll drift away</i>
<i>and sink, leaving no evidence.</i>

00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,342
SANDERS:
Just got off the phone
with the head porter

00:22:12,408 --> 00:22:14,110
at the Palermo Center.

00:22:14,177 --> 00:22:16,546
One of his guys
saw some crazy groupie chick

00:22:16,613 --> 00:22:17,947
Dumpster-diving last night.

00:22:18,014 --> 00:22:20,617
Thought the Web site
on her T-shirt was pretty funny.

00:22:20,683 --> 00:22:24,120
RascalFlattsPsychoBitch.com.

00:22:24,187 --> 00:22:25,822
(chuckling):
That is pretty funny.

00:22:25,889 --> 00:22:27,457
Yeah. I checked the site,

00:22:27,524 --> 00:22:29,626
she's been blogging
about Jay's guitar.

00:22:29,692 --> 00:22:32,162
(knocking on door)

00:22:33,763 --> 00:22:35,532
Are you Marta Petrovich?

00:22:35,598 --> 00:22:37,066
Yeah.

00:22:37,133 --> 00:22:38,201
We have a warrant
to search your apartment.

00:22:38,268 --> 00:22:40,904
Well, what are you looking for?

00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,173
Uh, we heard
about your guitar.

00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:44,374
We'd really love to see it.

00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:47,944
Oh! Well, you don't need
no warrant for that.

00:22:48,011 --> 00:22:49,379
I'd love to show it off.
Come on, come on.

00:22:49,446 --> 00:22:50,947
Come on.

00:22:51,014 --> 00:22:52,348
(squealing)

00:22:52,415 --> 00:22:54,017
Okay...

00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:55,218
(humming)

00:22:55,285 --> 00:22:57,220
Wow.
So nice.

00:22:57,287 --> 00:22:59,289
Yeah.
Ah!

00:22:59,355 --> 00:23:01,658
When I found it in the Dumpster,
I just about died.

00:23:01,724 --> 00:23:04,527
I love them so much.

00:23:04,594 --> 00:23:06,696
The problem is that
guitar is evidence

00:23:06,763 --> 00:23:09,566
in an attempted murder
investigation.

00:23:09,632 --> 00:23:11,568
Yeah, and you know,
you could be a hero,

00:23:11,634 --> 00:23:13,570
helping to solve
a really big case

00:23:13,636 --> 00:23:15,104
involving Rascal Flatts.

00:23:15,171 --> 00:23:16,706
Yeah, and I'm sure the
band would be happy

00:23:16,773 --> 00:23:18,675
to reward it to you
when we're done.

00:23:18,741 --> 00:23:21,644
Yeah, do you, uh, mind
if I step on your couch?

00:23:21,711 --> 00:23:25,381
Uh, I-I guess so...

00:23:25,448 --> 00:23:28,118
J-J-Just look, don't touch!

00:23:28,184 --> 00:23:29,719
I mean, Jay's fingers
are still on it.

00:23:29,786 --> 00:23:32,388
Oh, boy, yeah, I hope so.
Don't you, Greg?

00:23:32,455 --> 00:23:34,624
Mm-hmm.
Hmm-hmm.

00:23:38,361 --> 00:23:40,196
I hate to break it
to you, sweetie,

00:23:40,263 --> 00:23:42,031
but, uh, this guitar
is coming with us.

00:23:42,098 --> 00:23:44,467
No, no, no, no, it's mine.

00:23:44,534 --> 00:23:46,269
Yeah, I'm really sorry.
I found it!

00:23:46,336 --> 00:23:49,572
No, you can't do this!
Maybe we can get you
an autograph.

00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:52,375
(door opens)
(whimpering)

00:23:52,442 --> 00:23:55,879
(door closes)
(sighing)

00:23:55,945 --> 00:23:59,749
But I already have
their autographs.

00:23:59,816 --> 00:24:01,985
(whining)

00:24:07,557 --> 00:24:08,825
HALLIDAY:
At our headquarters,

00:24:08,892 --> 00:24:10,927
we have a whole food court
in the basement.

00:24:10,994 --> 00:24:13,196
I always get a kick
out of the idea that the girl

00:24:13,263 --> 00:24:14,931
serving the burgers
has to have security clearance.

00:24:18,168 --> 00:24:19,636
Craig Halliday,
Associate Director.

00:24:19,702 --> 00:24:21,404
You're Jim Brass.

00:24:21,471 --> 00:24:22,972
That's right.

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,776
So, uh, what do you need
from me, Mr. Halliday?

00:24:26,843 --> 00:24:30,713
Well, I think that you need
something from me.

00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,949
Oh, yeah?
An apology.

00:24:33,016 --> 00:24:35,385
I offered CSI
my full cooperation,

00:24:35,452 --> 00:24:38,421
and I hate always being
the bad guy.

00:24:38,488 --> 00:24:40,824
Ah, don't worry about it, I'm
always the bad guy around here.

00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,692
Oh, yeah?
So, anything else

00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:43,960
you want to get
off your chest?

00:24:44,027 --> 00:24:45,195
Captain, Larry Colton
to see you.

00:24:45,261 --> 00:24:48,131
No, I've achieved
what I came for.

00:24:52,502 --> 00:24:53,970
Your father was a great patriot.

00:24:54,037 --> 00:24:56,639
I'm here to sign whatever
there is to sign and go home.

00:24:56,706 --> 00:24:58,441
You know, I don't think I'm
gonna let you see the body.

00:24:58,508 --> 00:25:00,009
It's, uh, it's not
a good idea really.

00:25:00,076 --> 00:25:02,545
I haven't seen my father in
20 years, I couldn't care less.

00:25:02,612 --> 00:25:05,515
Mmm, I know
that he loved you very much.

00:25:05,582 --> 00:25:08,485
My father hated me.

00:25:08,551 --> 00:25:10,320
You know that;
it's in my file.

00:25:10,386 --> 00:25:12,655
Just by sitting here, he's
already started a file on you.

00:25:12,722 --> 00:25:15,325
So, besides you,
any other haters?

00:25:15,391 --> 00:25:17,293
All five of his wives.

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,630
The thousands of people he had
killed and everyone in between.

00:25:20,697 --> 00:25:23,166
Ah, if only we could kill them
by the thousands.

00:25:23,233 --> 00:25:25,602
The problem
with killing our enemies

00:25:25,668 --> 00:25:28,104
is that you can't spy on them
after that.

00:25:29,873 --> 00:25:32,909
Just want to let the family
know, the agency is behind you.

00:25:32,976 --> 00:25:37,647
Hmm, your way of saying that
you're sharpening the daggers,

00:25:37,714 --> 00:25:39,315
screwing on the silencers
and that the foreign flunky

00:25:39,382 --> 00:25:41,785
who took out my father is
about to get capped as payback.

00:25:41,851 --> 00:25:44,187
Executive order 11-905
forbids the agency

00:25:44,254 --> 00:25:46,122
from engaging in assassination.

00:25:46,189 --> 00:25:48,057
Okay, on that note,

00:25:48,124 --> 00:25:49,259
have you seen
what you needed?

00:25:49,325 --> 00:25:51,094
Because, uh, I think I
can handle it from here.

00:25:51,161 --> 00:25:54,831
Captain Brass.
Good-bye, Mr. Halliday.

00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,621
Tire tracks look like
they were made

00:26:18,688 --> 00:26:21,224
by Suburbans.
Three of them.

00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:22,959
SIDLE:
<i>Two miles from the house,</i>

00:26:23,026 --> 00:26:24,561
<i>a mile from where</i>
<i>we found the body.</i>

00:26:26,996 --> 00:26:31,267
And look, green paint transfer.

00:26:31,334 --> 00:26:33,102
Colton's canoe washed up here.

00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:38,942
LANGSTON:
<i>Halliday beat us here.</i>

00:26:42,045 --> 00:26:43,980
SIDLE:
Halliday spooks?

00:26:45,014 --> 00:26:47,050
That's not a Suburban.

00:26:47,117 --> 00:26:49,586
I'll call it in.
(dialing)

00:26:58,962 --> 00:27:01,331
Can I help you with something?

00:27:01,397 --> 00:27:03,433
(speaking German)

00:27:16,846 --> 00:27:17,480
Gun!

00:27:19,883 --> 00:27:21,918
I'm reaching
for my identification.

00:27:21,985 --> 00:27:26,723
This doesn't have to be
an international incident.

00:27:31,995 --> 00:27:35,098
You're with the
German consulate.

00:27:35,165 --> 00:27:36,666
As consulate officials,

00:27:36,733 --> 00:27:39,302
we are protected
by diplomatic immunity.

00:27:39,369 --> 00:27:41,204
Why don't you be diplomatic
and toss the guns out?

00:27:41,271 --> 00:27:45,308
This car is German soil.

00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:47,177
You have no jurisdiction
inside of it,

00:27:47,243 --> 00:27:48,812
including us.

00:27:50,513 --> 00:27:52,182
My passport.

00:27:52,248 --> 00:27:53,450
This is a bunch of crap.

00:27:53,516 --> 00:27:54,717
Yes, but he's telling the truth.

00:27:54,784 --> 00:27:56,286
For your information, gentlemen,

00:27:56,352 --> 00:27:59,823
it's illegal to shoot fish
in the state of Nevada.

00:28:00,857 --> 00:28:02,859
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

00:28:13,837 --> 00:28:16,773
(printer whirring)

00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,842
(whirring continues)

00:28:34,457 --> 00:28:37,166
So, even though
we're on a secure network,

00:28:37,232 --> 00:28:39,535
someone hacked
Hodges' computer.

00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:41,904
Why me?
Well, maybe it's because

00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,438
you like to surf
more outside sites

00:28:43,505 --> 00:28:44,673
than anyone else in the lab.

00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,341
It's all research.

00:28:46,408 --> 00:28:47,776
Archie, can't you just
trace the source of the hack?

00:28:47,843 --> 00:28:49,244
With enough time.

00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,779
Well, if I'm not needed,

00:28:50,846 --> 00:28:53,615
I need to go delete
some personal files.

00:28:55,284 --> 00:28:58,720
The book certainly starts off
with a bang.

00:28:58,787 --> 00:29:02,090
A word-for-word transcript
of a telephone conversation

00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:05,594
between the East German secret
police and Nettie Moller.

00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:08,163
She's like their German Obama.

00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,532
They say she's gonna win
the election by a landslide.

00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:13,335
Well, she won't
if this gets out.

00:29:13,402 --> 00:29:17,439
During the 1970s,
Moller was a double agent,

00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:20,642
recruiting agents for the CIA
and betraying them

00:29:20,709 --> 00:29:23,378
to the East German Stasi
for execution.

00:29:23,445 --> 00:29:25,581
You know, if we have
a copy of this memoir,

00:29:25,647 --> 00:29:27,316
it's not a stretch
to think that the Germans

00:29:27,382 --> 00:29:29,651
and the CIA
had it first.

00:29:29,718 --> 00:29:31,720
You can say anything
you want to say in a book,

00:29:31,787 --> 00:29:34,923
but Colton had to be working
from a tape when he wrote this.

00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:38,727
Halliday, the house,
the Germans.

00:29:38,794 --> 00:29:41,597
The tape is what
they were looking for.

00:29:41,663 --> 00:29:43,765
A tape worth killing for.

00:29:43,832 --> 00:29:45,100
Yes.

00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:48,470
Well, it's a decent theory
for a spy novel.

00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:50,172
What do we have in the way
of evidence?

00:29:50,239 --> 00:29:52,808
COD?
Nothing yet.

00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:54,610
Still waiting for tox.

00:29:56,645 --> 00:29:58,313
Pots are fried,

00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,415
but no shaved wires.

00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:03,252
This is the right guitar
but not the source of the shock.

00:30:03,318 --> 00:30:04,486
If it's not his guitar,

00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:09,691
then it's gotta be
his mic or his amp.

00:30:16,165 --> 00:30:17,633
Well, yee-haw.

00:30:17,699 --> 00:30:19,668
The ground on the amp
has been removed.

00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,069
Without grounds,
the circuit breaker's

00:30:21,136 --> 00:30:23,839
not gonna pop, you are.

00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:28,544
Yeah, but that alone's not
enough to cause electrocution.

00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:33,315
Well, the power comes
from the amp into the guitar

00:30:33,382 --> 00:30:36,285
and through Jay to his mic,

00:30:36,351 --> 00:30:39,288
where Jay's lips
close the circuit.

00:30:39,354 --> 00:30:41,723
XLR plug's been singed.

00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:45,127
This is part of the circuit
that shocked Jay.

00:30:45,194 --> 00:30:47,196
But there's not enough voltage
from a 110

00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,364
to leave fern patterns
on his arms like that.

00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,533
220 had to come
from somewhere.

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,535
Well, the venue
runs on 220.

00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:56,738
All somebody had to do
was sabotage a 110 box

00:30:56,805 --> 00:30:58,607
so 220 could run
through it.

00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,246
Here you go,
this is 220 right here.

00:31:06,515 --> 00:31:10,185
<i>Once whoever did this linked</i>
<i>the 220 to the sabotaged 110,</i>

00:31:10,252 --> 00:31:12,988
<i>it sent the 220</i>
<i>directly into Jay.</i>

00:31:13,055 --> 00:31:14,890
<i>And without a breaker</i>
<i>to protect him,</i>

00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:16,592
<i>as soon as his lips</i>
<i>touch the mic,</i>

00:31:16,658 --> 00:31:18,660
<i>Jay fries.</i>

00:31:20,229 --> 00:31:22,331
♪ When your heart
is full of doubt ♪

00:31:22,397 --> 00:31:25,767
♪ And you think that
there's no way out ♪

00:31:25,834 --> 00:31:29,004
(electricity crackling)
♪ You find your faith

00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,412
So, wait a minute,
why didn't Jay get zapped

00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:38,947
when the concert started?

00:31:39,014 --> 00:31:40,949
When his lips

00:31:41,016 --> 00:31:42,684
first touched that mic?
I don't know.

00:31:42,751 --> 00:31:45,721
But whoever's responsible
for this had to rig this box.

00:31:45,788 --> 00:31:48,390
So maybe there's some
prints on the inside.

00:31:48,457 --> 00:31:50,492
If we get an ID,
we'll ask him ourselves.

00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:53,228
Henry, what do you have for me?

00:31:53,295 --> 00:31:57,065
Well, I ran an expanded
tox panel on Vance Colton,

00:31:57,132 --> 00:32:00,102
all the normal drugs of abuse
and poisons were negative.

00:32:02,104 --> 00:32:04,540
Not even the cancer drugs.

00:32:04,606 --> 00:32:07,276
No, he wasn't taking
any medications.

00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,211
The man had stage four cancer.

00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:11,346
Then he must've
stopped treatment.

00:32:11,413 --> 00:32:12,948
(sighing)

00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:14,149
All right, try these.

00:32:14,216 --> 00:32:18,554
Aconitine, succinylcholine,

00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,556
fluphenazine and sarin.

00:32:20,622 --> 00:32:23,258
I've never heard of aconitine.

00:32:23,325 --> 00:32:25,794
Fluphenazine is a psychotropic.

00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,329
Sarin's a binary
chemical weapon.

00:32:27,396 --> 00:32:29,331
Saddam used it against
the Kurds in the '80s.

00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:32,468
But I thought the United Nations
banned production

00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,236
and stockpiling
of all chemical weapons.

00:32:34,303 --> 00:32:36,672
Correct, but all four compounds

00:32:36,738 --> 00:32:39,341
are mentioned here
in Colton's memoir.

00:32:39,408 --> 00:32:40,676
Tools of the spy trade.

00:32:40,742 --> 00:32:43,745
(computer beeping and chirping)

00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,654
(typing)

00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:56,825
Okay, backed the last zombie
to the source.

00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:59,094
Hodges' printer was hacked here,

00:32:59,161 --> 00:33:00,429
in Vegas.

00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:02,131
German Consulate
or Halliday's office?

00:33:02,197 --> 00:33:04,166
(keys tapping)

00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:07,870
Coffee shop
at the Blue Siren Motel.

00:33:07,936 --> 00:33:10,472
That's not very 007.

00:33:12,508 --> 00:33:14,510
(TV playing indistinctly)

00:33:24,486 --> 00:33:27,256
I mean, it figures the
Colton kid was lying to us.

00:33:27,322 --> 00:33:28,924
He's been registered
here for four nights.

00:33:28,991 --> 00:33:31,927
SIDLE:
Which means he checked in a day
before his father was killed.

00:33:31,994 --> 00:33:33,996
(TV playing indistinctly)

00:33:37,366 --> 00:33:40,369
(silenced gunshots)

00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,844
Yeah, the manager says
he may still be in his room.

00:33:48,911 --> 00:33:50,579
The door is open.

00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:04,660
He's dead.

00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:11,967
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,269
Well, they
tossed the room,

00:34:14,336 --> 00:34:16,505
probably looking
for that tape.

00:34:16,572 --> 00:34:17,906
And his computer's gone.

00:34:22,211 --> 00:34:24,146
Control, this is
Captain Brass.

00:34:24,213 --> 00:34:26,482
We have a 419
down at the Blue Siren Motel.

00:34:26,548 --> 00:34:28,383
Send backup...

00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:30,452
and the coroner's wagon.

00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:38,427
The Germans want us to know
they didn't kill Vance Colton.

00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:41,263
<i>And they also want us to know</i>
<i>they killed his son.</i>

00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:03,792
You call my mother
a whore in print,

00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:05,060
you say I'm a bastard.

00:35:05,127 --> 00:35:07,162
It's just more
of your lies.
She was a whore,

00:35:07,229 --> 00:35:09,264
you don't exist, and
I'm going fishing.

00:35:12,467 --> 00:35:14,503
(grunts)
(groans)

00:35:16,571 --> 00:35:19,174
LANGSTON:
<i>Larry died believing</i>
<i>he'd killed his father.</i>

00:35:19,241 --> 00:35:20,809
<i>He sent us the manuscript</i>

00:35:20,876 --> 00:35:23,812
<i>to deflect suspicion</i>
<i>from himself onto the Germans.</i>

00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,216
From Colton's vest,
we always assumed

00:35:28,283 --> 00:35:31,253
that Colton was on the dock
because he was going fishing.

00:35:31,319 --> 00:35:33,321
But there's no
fishing equipment here.

00:35:33,388 --> 00:35:35,157
Colton took down the canoe.

00:35:35,223 --> 00:35:37,559
So, he planned
to go out on the water

00:35:37,626 --> 00:35:38,894
before Larry put him there.

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,129
But if Larry
hadn't been there,

00:35:41,196 --> 00:35:42,631
what was going to happen next?

00:35:42,697 --> 00:35:46,268
Vance Colton was going to die
anyway.

00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:48,703
By whose hand?

00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:51,339
That's what's bothering me.

00:35:51,406 --> 00:35:53,442
I bet if we dug
a little deeper,

00:35:53,508 --> 00:35:55,143
we'd find out that
when Larry was a boy,

00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,813
he wanted to be
just like his father,
even though he hated him.

00:35:57,879 --> 00:36:01,383
You always see something of
both parents in yourself.

00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,885
Even if it's more than
you'd like to admit.

00:36:03,952 --> 00:36:05,554
Hey, I got your COD,

00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,723
and it's right
out of James Bond.

00:36:07,789 --> 00:36:09,324
Just call me "H."

00:36:09,391 --> 00:36:12,327
You get it? 'Cause
"M" and the "H"...
"H," "Q,"

00:36:12,394 --> 00:36:13,762
Yeah.
special branch-- I get it.

00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:15,931
Right, I-I tested all the
poisons from the memoir,

00:36:15,997 --> 00:36:17,365
and you're negative
on the first three.

00:36:17,432 --> 00:36:18,667
Which leaves sarin.

00:36:18,734 --> 00:36:20,102
It was first created
by the Germans

00:36:20,168 --> 00:36:22,771
as a super pesticide
until World War II

00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:25,340
when they discovered it was very
effective at killing people.

00:36:25,407 --> 00:36:26,508
Back to the Germans.

00:36:26,575 --> 00:36:29,344
These levels of sarin
you found in Vance Colton

00:36:29,411 --> 00:36:31,012
should have killed
him instantly.

00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:33,048
Which suggests the poison
was administered

00:36:33,115 --> 00:36:34,483
when he was already
in the canoe.

00:36:34,549 --> 00:36:36,385
Yeah, but out on the
lake and out cold?

00:36:36,451 --> 00:36:37,619
Why didn't they
just shoot him?

00:36:37,686 --> 00:36:39,020
That's a good point.

00:36:39,087 --> 00:36:41,022
Henry, is there a way
to make sarin

00:36:41,089 --> 00:36:42,557
not instantaneously lethal?

00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,892
Well, it's a clear liquid,

00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:46,495
so I suppose it's possible
to put it in a capsule.

00:36:46,561 --> 00:36:48,730
Which means it would
take some time to dissolve

00:36:48,797 --> 00:36:51,032
before it entered the system,
so he could've

00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:53,201
ingested it before
he was out on the dock.

00:36:54,536 --> 00:36:55,504
This doesn't make any sense.

00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,172
Yes, but Catherine
asked for COD.

00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:59,241
That she did.

00:37:01,243 --> 00:37:02,677
I'll tell her.

00:37:04,045 --> 00:37:06,014
ANDREWS:
Dr. Ray? You think
I could read

00:37:06,081 --> 00:37:08,183
the rest of Colton's book?
I love spy thrillers.

00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:11,386
No. I'm going to return this
to its author.

00:37:11,453 --> 00:37:14,456
(indistinct chatter, jazz music
playing in background)

00:37:20,762 --> 00:37:23,165
I'd offer to buy you a drink,
but you already got one.

00:37:23,231 --> 00:37:24,933
Can I have a scotch?
Okay.

00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,169
It needs to be a new bottle
Sure.

00:37:27,235 --> 00:37:29,604
with the seal unbroken.
You got it.

00:37:29,671 --> 00:37:31,106
Seriously?

00:37:31,173 --> 00:37:34,042
(chuckles):
I'm just kidding.

00:37:34,109 --> 00:37:37,279
Thanks for calling me and...
and bringing me this.

00:37:40,916 --> 00:37:43,452
Sometimes old men forget
the promises they made,

00:37:43,518 --> 00:37:46,021
and secrets must
remain just that.

00:37:46,088 --> 00:37:48,423
I think Colton
kept his promises,

00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:50,625
which is why you gave him
exactly what he wanted.

00:37:50,692 --> 00:37:52,694
What was it that he wanted?

00:37:52,761 --> 00:37:55,030
His way out of this world.

00:37:55,097 --> 00:37:57,432
Yeah, drowning sure
is a tough way to go.

00:37:57,499 --> 00:37:59,534
So is cancer.

00:37:59,601 --> 00:38:00,869
So is blunt force trauma.

00:38:00,936 --> 00:38:03,438
With sons like that,
who needs enemies, huh?

00:38:03,505 --> 00:38:04,673
Cheers.

00:38:10,445 --> 00:38:14,850
We both know what killed him
was the sarin you gave him.

00:38:30,665 --> 00:38:33,101
Sarin?

00:38:33,168 --> 00:38:34,770
They don't even make
that stuff anymore.

00:38:34,836 --> 00:38:36,438
Germans still make it.
Hmm.

00:38:36,505 --> 00:38:38,774
You put Colton
back in business.

00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,542
You had him write the memoir.

00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:43,211
You provided the Moller tape.

00:38:43,278 --> 00:38:44,980
If there ever was a Moller tape.

00:38:45,046 --> 00:38:47,949
If someone believes
there's a tape, there's a tape.

00:38:48,016 --> 00:38:51,119
I believe that Colton

00:38:51,186 --> 00:38:53,955
posted the manuscript
on the Internet,

00:38:54,022 --> 00:38:55,791
knowing that the Germans
would read it.

00:38:55,857 --> 00:38:58,560
No, I don't think so,
because Colton was retired.

00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,395
He was dying of cancer.

00:39:00,462 --> 00:39:02,397
I doubt that he cared
about German politics.

00:39:02,464 --> 00:39:04,299
He cared about his legacy.

00:39:04,366 --> 00:39:06,601
He didn't want to come in
from the cold and die
a sick, old man.

00:39:06,668 --> 00:39:08,303
He wanted to go out a hero,

00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:11,039
poisoned by his old enemies
fighting for his country.

00:39:11,106 --> 00:39:13,708
So you helped an old friend
commit suicide.

00:39:14,976 --> 00:39:18,980
Well, Dr. Langston,
you like the...

00:39:19,047 --> 00:39:23,085
extra spin around the block,

00:39:23,151 --> 00:39:27,556
uh, goes beyond the cut-and-dry

00:39:27,622 --> 00:39:30,058
microscoped answer from
the green paint chips of life.

00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,861
You know where I work,

00:39:32,928 --> 00:39:35,897
that block
has an unlimited horizon.

00:39:38,233 --> 00:39:41,169
Are you offering me a job?

00:39:41,236 --> 00:39:43,371
Have you found one yet
that fits?

00:39:50,078 --> 00:39:51,613
Well, my mistake.

00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,685
Thanks for the drink.

00:39:58,587 --> 00:40:01,356
Did your father ever talk to you
about his time in Vietnam?

00:40:01,423 --> 00:40:03,658
It was an odd place
to take leave

00:40:03,725 --> 00:40:05,594
with a war staring us
in the face.

00:40:08,163 --> 00:40:11,233
Or maybe you two
weren't that close?

00:40:23,412 --> 00:40:25,414
(indistinct chatter)

00:40:35,457 --> 00:40:37,225
STOKES:
There he is right there.

00:40:37,292 --> 00:40:38,894
Just hang on a second.

00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,962
How's it going, fellas?

00:40:42,215 --> 00:40:43,383
Mr. Murray?

00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:47,754
I think you know
why I'm here.

00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:49,356
Man, we got
a show to do.

00:40:49,423 --> 00:40:50,724
Yeah, not with him,
you're not.

00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:53,593
He's the one that sabotaged
Jay's equipment.

00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,828
What?!

00:40:54,895 --> 00:40:57,030
GARY:
Travis?

00:40:57,097 --> 00:40:58,432
Why would you do something
like that?

00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,468
I just meant to give him
a little jolt

00:41:01,535 --> 00:41:03,236
so I... so I could do
the one song.

00:41:03,303 --> 00:41:05,072
Travis, all you had
to do was ask.

00:41:05,138 --> 00:41:08,775
I... Don't-don't you guys see?

00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:11,011
I'm getting old.

00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:13,246
Th-th-the show was over

00:41:13,313 --> 00:41:15,515
(handcuffs clicking)
after this tour for me.

00:41:15,582 --> 00:41:17,784
JOE DON: Jay.
GARY: Hey, Jay!

00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,788
Jay, I...

00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,623
I didn't mean for this
to get so out of control.

00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,225
Man, you lit me up like
a Christmas tree,

00:41:25,292 --> 00:41:26,593
and you smoked
my best guitar.

00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,028
Why would you do that?

00:41:28,095 --> 00:41:30,197
I'm sorry, man.

00:41:30,263 --> 00:41:32,099
What did I do to you?
I'm sorry.

00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:36,737
Are you back?

00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,039
Look at me.

00:41:39,106 --> 00:41:40,474
You recognize me?

00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:44,578
A face like yours, as ugly
as it is, it's hard to forget.

00:41:44,645 --> 00:41:45,779
GARY:
Oh, yeah, laugh if you

00:41:45,846 --> 00:41:47,147
want to,
but I'm the one that's

00:41:47,214 --> 00:41:48,715
sitting there been covering
for you this entire time.

00:41:48,782 --> 00:41:50,784
Hey, right back at you, big boy.
JAY:
Hey, guys.

00:41:50,851 --> 00:41:52,819
I wrote a new song
while I was in the hospital.

00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:54,488
It's a little bit different.
You're gonna have to follow me.

00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:56,056
You guys stick around.

00:41:56,123 --> 00:41:58,125
We're going to have
some fun tonight.

00:42:00,661 --> 00:42:02,262
BUDDY:
Okay.

00:42:02,329 --> 00:42:03,997
Enjoy yourselves tonight.

00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:05,766
(cheering and applause)

00:42:10,637 --> 00:42:13,640
Hey, Las Vegas!
How y'all feeling?

00:42:13,707 --> 00:42:15,909
(cheering and applause
continues)

00:42:15,976 --> 00:42:18,945
As most of you know,
Cousin Jay got a little shocked

00:42:19,012 --> 00:42:20,447
last night on stage.

00:42:20,514 --> 00:42:23,450
And, um... he's feeling better.

00:42:23,517 --> 00:42:25,952
He doesn't look any better
but he's feeling better.

00:42:26,019 --> 00:42:28,121
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jay DeMarcus. He's back!

00:42:28,188 --> 00:42:30,324
(cheering)
Thank you.

00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:32,225
I got a little song
I wrote for you.

00:42:32,292 --> 00:42:33,760
You guys just follow
along, we'll do this.

00:42:33,827 --> 00:42:34,928
Y'all ready?

00:42:34,995 --> 00:42:37,631
(cheering)
Okay. Here we go.

00:42:37,698 --> 00:42:40,767
Kick it off.
