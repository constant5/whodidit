00:00:04,458 --> 00:00:06,460
(dog barking)

00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,569
(barking continues outside)

00:00:18,635 --> 00:00:20,737
Try "extrapolate."

00:00:20,804 --> 00:00:23,540
(barking continues)

00:00:26,367 --> 00:00:27,634
(chuckles)

00:00:27,701 --> 00:00:29,203
You want to do me
another favor?

00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:30,671
Uh-uh.

00:00:30,738 --> 00:00:32,573
Get Rocket to
stop barking?

00:00:32,639 --> 00:00:34,308
It's your turn
to bring him in.

00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,677
Hmm.

00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:38,946
(barking continues)

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:51,158
I bet he's harassing

00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:52,926
that poor little possum again.

00:00:52,993 --> 00:00:54,728
(barking stops)

00:00:57,097 --> 00:00:58,432
(barking resumes)

00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:04,071
(window creaking)

00:01:05,773 --> 00:01:07,007
(dog barking)

00:01:07,074 --> 00:01:08,342
(gunshot, dog whimpers)

00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:10,210
(barking stops)

00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:12,479
(door opening)

00:01:12,546 --> 00:01:13,681
(glass breaking)

00:01:13,747 --> 00:01:14,815
(woman screaming)

00:01:14,882 --> 00:01:16,050
Lisa!

00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:18,419
(thudding)

00:01:18,485 --> 00:01:19,987
(Lisa screaming)
Lisa!

00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:22,456
(gunshot)

00:01:22,523 --> 00:01:24,158
(gasping)

00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,226
(wind whistling)

00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:31,031
What the hell is wrong
with you?

00:01:31,098 --> 00:01:36,003
Now you're really in trouble.

00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,305
MAN:
Lisa!

00:01:38,372 --> 00:01:39,707
(gunshot)

00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:42,476
(camera shutter clicking)

00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:47,981
(distant siren wailing)

00:01:58,258 --> 00:02:01,895
MAN:
As soon as I saw their dog,
I knew something was wrong.

00:02:01,962 --> 00:02:04,264
Then I saw the door open
and Ms. Layman inside.

00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:05,666
You touch anything?

00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:07,468
No, sir.
I just called 911.

00:02:09,403 --> 00:02:11,839
No shell casings.

00:02:11,905 --> 00:02:13,774
None here either.

00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:15,876
Weapon was probably a revolver.

00:02:15,943 --> 00:02:19,680
Wife hears the commotion,
comes out...

00:02:19,747 --> 00:02:21,949
She struggles with the killer.

00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,517
He drops her.

00:02:23,584 --> 00:02:25,252
Lisa, honey, what's wrong?!

00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,856
(three gunshots, man groans)

00:02:31,058 --> 00:02:33,227
(camera shutter clicking)

00:02:41,935 --> 00:02:45,039
SIDLE:
Got a partial shoe impression.

00:02:45,105 --> 00:02:46,373
Generic worker boot.

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,808
Roughly 10 to 13.

00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:53,247
WILLOWS:
We'll put a broadcast out
on the daughter.

00:02:53,313 --> 00:02:55,416
That's about all we can do
for now.

00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:57,785
Yeah, that's the one thing

00:02:57,851 --> 00:02:59,453
I hate most about this job.

00:03:03,223 --> 00:03:04,324
(gunshot, man groans)

00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:05,659
Daddy! Daddy!

00:03:05,726 --> 00:03:07,928
(screaming)

00:03:08,929 --> 00:03:10,397
(three gunshots)

00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,633
(gunman panting)

00:03:14,868 --> 00:03:16,203
(indistinct police
radio chatter)

00:03:26,347 --> 00:03:29,149
There's a wallet
and a purse

00:03:29,216 --> 00:03:30,784
in the master bedroom,

00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:33,187
both filled with
cash and cards,

00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:37,524
so this wasn't
a home invasion robbery.

00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:39,760
And looks like they came
for Gracie.

00:03:39,827 --> 00:03:41,628
Mm-hmm.

00:03:41,695 --> 00:03:45,265
Tom Layman was a pit boss
at the Palermo.

00:03:45,332 --> 00:03:48,335
Lisa was working here at home
as a freelance

00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:51,472
technical writer.

00:03:51,538 --> 00:03:55,642
They were a regular
middle-class family,

00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:56,877
not typical targets

00:03:56,944 --> 00:03:58,312
for kidnappers.

00:04:01,515 --> 00:04:03,984
I don't see any blood.

00:04:13,027 --> 00:04:14,628
There's a crawl trail here.

00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:16,030
See that?
Green fluorescence--

00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:17,865
urine.

00:04:38,752 --> 00:04:40,087
(screaming)

00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,222
Gracie. Gracie,
it's okay.

00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:44,158
My name's Nick.
I'm with the police department.

00:04:44,224 --> 00:04:45,325
You're safe now.

00:04:45,392 --> 00:04:48,195
Come here, honey.

00:04:48,262 --> 00:04:49,897
Oh, baby, it's all right.

00:04:49,963 --> 00:04:51,965
Come here. It's okay.

00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:55,035
Aw.

00:04:57,204 --> 00:04:59,239
It's okay.

00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:00,441
Oh...

00:05:00,507 --> 00:05:01,608
(crying)

00:05:03,377 --> 00:05:05,579
I got you, honey.

00:05:05,646 --> 00:05:09,116
(sobbing)
It's okay.

00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,352
I got you.

00:05:22,763 --> 00:05:25,532

(tapping)
Hey, Sara, I found
some fresh tool marks

00:06:20,395 --> 00:06:21,997
on the windowsill.

00:06:22,064 --> 00:06:23,832
Looks like somebody jimmied it.

00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:27,069
Well, the shooter definitely
came in through the back door.

00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:29,771
<i>But maybe he did</i>
<i>a little recon first.</i>

00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:36,011
In L.A., the Manson family

00:06:36,078 --> 00:06:38,413
used to do "creepy crawls."

00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,816
They would break into a house
while the people were asleep

00:06:40,882 --> 00:06:42,050
and sneak around inside.

00:06:42,117 --> 00:06:43,585
Knowing they
had the power

00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:45,254
to end people's lives
like that

00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,489
must have been a real turn-on
for them.

00:06:50,158 --> 00:06:51,960
Got a print.

00:07:10,145 --> 00:07:12,748
(grunting and panting)

00:07:12,814 --> 00:07:15,083
(gunman straining)

00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:23,258
(soft beep)

00:07:33,135 --> 00:07:34,469
(soft beep)

00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:51,920
SANDERS:
<i>Mandy got a hit off that print</i>

00:07:51,987 --> 00:07:53,488
on the windowsill.

00:07:53,555 --> 00:07:55,357
STOKES:
The gardener?

00:07:55,424 --> 00:07:57,025
He's just going to say
he left it

00:07:57,092 --> 00:07:58,594
when he was working
around the house.

00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,795
Yeah, well, I'm more interested

00:07:59,861 --> 00:08:01,730
in what the little girl
has to say.

00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:03,365
(sighs)
Child witness--

00:08:03,432 --> 00:08:05,567
that's not a lot
to hang your hat on.

00:08:05,634 --> 00:08:07,102
We got anything else?

00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:09,037
Just some metallic trace
in the killer's bootprint

00:08:09,104 --> 00:08:10,339
and on the wife's robe.

00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:11,740
All right.

00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:13,609
I'll let you know how it goes.
Later.

00:08:13,675 --> 00:08:15,410
(phone beeps off and flips shut)

00:08:15,477 --> 00:08:17,479
(television playing softly)

00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:27,089
Hey, Gracie.

00:08:27,155 --> 00:08:28,690
You remember me?

00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:29,858
Yeah?

00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:31,727
Can I sit here with you?

00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,132
I've got some
good news for you.

00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:40,602
Your Aunt Maggie's flying in
from Boston to see you.

00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,771
She's going to be here
real soon.

00:08:42,838 --> 00:08:45,307
But hey, listen,
I'm stuck,

00:08:45,374 --> 00:08:46,875
and I need some help.

00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:49,378
It's very important.
You want to help me?

00:08:49,444 --> 00:08:51,113
Hmm?
Okay.

00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:52,648
(phone beeps on)

00:08:52,714 --> 00:08:54,716
You know who he is?

00:08:56,618 --> 00:08:57,753
He's our gardener.

00:08:57,819 --> 00:08:59,655
Is he the guy
you saw last night?

00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,326
(gunshot, man groans)
Daddy!

00:09:04,393 --> 00:09:06,361
(screaming)

00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:07,763
(three gunshots)

00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:09,765
(panting)

00:09:09,831 --> 00:09:11,733
(door creaking)

00:09:13,468 --> 00:09:15,504
(wind whistling)

00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,876
(gun cocking)

00:09:22,277 --> 00:09:24,279
(sobbing quietly)

00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,121
(screaming furiously)

00:09:46,268 --> 00:09:49,171
It was really dark, and...

00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:54,843
I really couldn't see anything.

00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,845
I'm sorry.

00:09:56,912 --> 00:09:59,381
Hey, don't be scared, honey.

00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:01,350
You're safe now.

00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,218
Nobody's going to get you.

00:10:03,285 --> 00:10:06,655
You can tell me:
Is this the guy

00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:07,756
who hurt your parents?

00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:16,665
It was him, right?

00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,273
I'm glad you're feeling better.

00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:26,475
So maybe I leaned
against the window

00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,076
while trimming the bushes.
So what?

00:10:28,143 --> 00:10:30,879
So you're a convicted felon,
that's what.

00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:32,381
So you got a record, right?

00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:34,883
B&amp;E, assault,
grand larceny.

00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,385
The gang unit tells me

00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:39,321
you were a member of the
L.V. Marrones back in the day.

00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,889
They also tell me
three weeks ago,

00:10:40,956 --> 00:10:42,591
you were hanging
at Jackson and K.

00:10:42,658 --> 00:10:44,059
That's where the Marrones
deal heroin.

00:10:44,126 --> 00:10:45,460
But you know that anyway, right?

00:10:45,527 --> 00:10:46,962
I'm not on probation anymore.
Yeah.

00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:49,364
Every once in a while I go by
the old neighborhood,

00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:50,565
say hi to the homies.

00:10:50,632 --> 00:10:51,700
Sure, I understand.

00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:53,135
You want to go by
the clubhouse,

00:10:53,201 --> 00:10:55,170
kick it, chill,
drink some 40s,

00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,539
smoke some herb,
watch football...

00:10:57,606 --> 00:10:59,141
and plan some robberies
and murders.

00:10:59,207 --> 00:11:02,844
I don't run with those guys,
and I didn't touch the Laymans.

00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:05,180
I got a wife and a kid,

00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,150
and I've been doing it straight
for nine years.

00:11:08,216 --> 00:11:10,319
You guys just don't lay off
a guy's ass,

00:11:10,385 --> 00:11:11,787
just hoping he's gonna screw up.

00:11:11,853 --> 00:11:12,821
What's your shoe size?

00:11:12,888 --> 00:11:14,222
Why?

00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:15,958
Because I asked you.
That's why.

00:11:16,024 --> 00:11:17,593
Eleven.

00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:18,727
Eleven.

00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:21,096
You said the magic word.
Give me your shoes.

00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:25,167
Now you want to give them to me
or you want me

00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:28,637
to get some professional in here
to take them off you?

00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:36,311
Look, I was never in that house.

00:11:36,378 --> 00:11:38,747
Are you sure about that, homes?

00:11:38,814 --> 00:11:40,749
Are you absolutely sure

00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:42,818
about that?

00:11:42,884 --> 00:11:45,754
Because if I toss
your place and I find

00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:48,357
one eensy-bitsy piece of swag

00:11:48,423 --> 00:11:49,491
from the Laymans...

00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:54,129
Okay, fine.

00:11:54,196 --> 00:11:56,198
I snuck in that window...

00:11:56,265 --> 00:11:58,934
not last night, last week.

00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:01,470
I looked inside, 
and I saw their kid playing

00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:03,105
with a brand-new
video game box.

00:12:03,171 --> 00:12:07,376
The old one was just sitting
there on the shelf.

00:12:07,442 --> 00:12:09,511
So I waited till they went out,

00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:10,979
I went inside,

00:12:11,046 --> 00:12:12,714
And I took it.

00:12:14,016 --> 00:12:16,852
I make $60 a day pulling weeds
and shoveling dog crap.

00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,186
How do you think it feels?

00:12:18,253 --> 00:12:20,923
I can't even afford
to buy my kid one game.

00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:28,096
I didn't kill anyone, I swear.

00:12:41,576 --> 00:12:43,512
Gardener's boots had
the same tread pattern

00:12:43,578 --> 00:12:44,646
as the crime scene
impression,

00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:48,150
but there was no
characteristic match.

00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:50,485
And apparently,
they're negative for blood.

00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:53,622
There was no metallic
trace on them either.

00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,824
Any luck in Ballistics?

00:12:55,891 --> 00:12:58,226
Well, the bullets
we recovered were all .22s

00:12:58,293 --> 00:12:59,661
fired from
the same gun.

00:12:59,728 --> 00:13:03,432
Nothing in IBIS,
so no real luck at all.

00:13:03,498 --> 00:13:07,869
Luck is where opportunity
meets preparation.

00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:16,011
The metallic dust
was a titanium alloy

00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:18,947
consisting of 4% vanadium
and 6% aluminum.

00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:20,983
That's an odd material
to find in a garden.

00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:24,453
Definitely. Titanium is
widely used in aerospace

00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:25,621
and high-end tooling.

00:13:25,687 --> 00:13:27,422
Based on
the particle size

00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:32,894
and uniformity, my guess is,
they came from a machine shop.

00:13:32,961 --> 00:13:35,931
Titanium dust on the killer's
boots and hands?

00:13:35,998 --> 00:13:39,201
Maybe we're looking
for an industrial worker?

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:46,074
You know, if there was dust
on the inside of the house...

00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:49,244
(wind whistling)

00:14:24,146 --> 00:14:27,649
(gate creaking)

00:14:27,716 --> 00:14:29,718
(wind whistling)

00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:38,460
OFFICER:
Thought you guys
checked this house.

00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:40,729
STOKES:
Twice. Both times, nobody home.

00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,536
SIDLE:
I got a blood smear.

00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:52,674
(doorknob jiggles)

00:14:52,741 --> 00:14:54,910
STOKES:
It's unlocked.

00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,079
Vegas Police!

00:14:58,413 --> 00:14:59,781
Call for backup.

00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:01,683
(static crackles)
OFFICER: Control. Akers.

00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,518
Two additional units backup
at my location.

00:15:03,585 --> 00:15:05,921
DISPATCHER:
Copy, Akers, 105.
(static crackles)

00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:38,253
(whispers):
.22s.

00:15:40,155 --> 00:15:41,957
(wind whistling, dull thud)

00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,699
(water running)

00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,979
(water running)

00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,014
(door creaking)

00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:07,983
(radio playing music softly)

00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:49,024
(soft, repetitive
mechanical humming)

00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:17,920
(repetitive mechanical humming
grows louder)

00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,394
(mill humming)

00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:34,069
(electronic beep)

00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,572
(computer beeps)

00:17:48,183 --> 00:17:49,618
Nick!

00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,417
LVPD tell 8 News Now
that they want

00:18:02,484 --> 00:18:04,920
to talk to retired machinist
Jack Herson.

00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:07,823
Herson, in his 50s,
is a person of interest

00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:10,258
in the violent home invasion
that shattered the calm

00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:13,195
in that normally quiet
neighborhood.

00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:16,131
Well, I'm pretty darn sure
he hated that dog.

00:18:16,198 --> 00:18:20,135
Furry bastard was always
tearing up flower beds,

00:18:20,202 --> 00:18:23,238
chasing cats,
barking at all hours.

00:18:23,305 --> 00:18:25,574
Enough to drive anybody
to murder.

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,642
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:36,918
(camera shutter clicks)

00:19:03,665 --> 00:19:07,616
Jack Herson owns a 12-shot
.22-caliber revolver

00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:11,753
with the same GRCs
as the murder bullets.

00:19:13,188 --> 00:19:14,756
Any sign of the gun?

00:19:14,823 --> 00:19:16,591
Hasn't turned up.

00:19:16,658 --> 00:19:18,393
After what he did,
he'd probably

00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,961
be keeping that with him.

00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:21,396
We anywhere on his contacts?

00:19:21,463 --> 00:19:23,331
His Internet service provider
gave us access

00:19:23,398 --> 00:19:24,733
to all of his accounts.

00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,735
There are hundreds of e-mails,
hundreds of phone numbers.

00:19:26,802 --> 00:19:29,404
The few with the same
last names are relatives,

00:19:29,471 --> 00:19:31,173
and we know they're
are all back east.

00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:33,642
As for his friends...

00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:36,077
it's gonna take a while
to round up

00:19:36,144 --> 00:19:38,814
even the local ones.

00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:41,583
LANGSTON:
Hey.

00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,419
Hey. I just got off
the phone with Brass.

00:19:44,486 --> 00:19:47,255
We're not gonna find Herson
by trapping his plastic.

00:19:47,322 --> 00:19:48,824
According to his
credit card company,

00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,559
he's been maxed out
for months.

00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,661
Great.

00:19:52,727 --> 00:19:54,996
So, at this point,
we seem to be dealing

00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:56,765
with a nice,
retired machinist

00:19:56,832 --> 00:19:58,400
who suddenly goes
on a killing spree

00:19:58,467 --> 00:19:59,868
because he's behind
on his bills.

00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:02,737
Well, one day,
the wrong synapse fires,

00:20:02,804 --> 00:20:04,239
and a dam bursts.

00:20:04,306 --> 00:20:06,541
No one can truly know
what goes on

00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:08,376
inside another man's mind.

00:20:08,443 --> 00:20:09,511
No.

00:20:19,054 --> 00:20:21,189
Nick, come take a look at this.

00:20:29,764 --> 00:20:32,033
I'm assuming that's not
just another machine part.

00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,902
It's a surgical tool.

00:20:33,969 --> 00:20:35,036
According to the witness,

00:20:35,103 --> 00:20:36,471
it was a straight-up
hit-and-run.

00:20:36,538 --> 00:20:37,672
Started as a fender-bender.

00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:38,840
One driver got out pissed;

00:20:38,907 --> 00:20:40,742
the pickup ran him
over and split.

00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:42,477
When the responding officer
called in the tags,

00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:43,778
it came up as Herson.

00:20:43,845 --> 00:20:46,481
Injured driver's in stable
condition at Desert Palm.

00:20:46,548 --> 00:20:48,183
Ah, he was lucky.

00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:52,420
South Turkson at Blue Diamond
three hours ago.

00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:53,855
Where was Herson going?

00:20:56,625 --> 00:21:01,429
These are pieces of a prototype
stereotactic frame.

00:21:01,496 --> 00:21:03,665
It's what a machinist makes

00:21:03,732 --> 00:21:06,234
in order to ensure
his design works

00:21:06,301 --> 00:21:08,804
before he mills a real one.

00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,372
SIDLE:
Out of titanium,
I'm guessing.

00:21:10,438 --> 00:21:11,373
Yeah.

00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:12,274
What's it for?

00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,276
Neurosurgery.

00:21:14,342 --> 00:21:17,879
<i>The surgeon locks it</i>
<i>onto the patient's skull,</i>

00:21:17,946 --> 00:21:20,715
<i>and then uses</i>
<i>the calibration marks</i>

00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:24,619
<i>to precisely position</i>
<i>instruments</i>

00:21:24,686 --> 00:21:26,988
<i>for operating on the brain.</i>

00:21:27,055 --> 00:21:28,857
(squishing)

00:21:28,924 --> 00:21:31,726
You think Jack Herson
is Dr. Jekyll.

00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:33,361
SIDLE:
Why would a methodical killer
like Jekyll

00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:35,997
suddenly go ballistic and kill
his next-door neighbor?

00:21:36,064 --> 00:21:37,299
Maybe the Laymans
saw something.

00:21:37,365 --> 00:21:39,201
Figured out what Herson
was doing down here.

00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:42,070
Jekyll's killed a witness
out of panic before.

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,077
To perform surgery, you...
you need a operating table,

00:21:49,144 --> 00:21:51,413
don't you, Doctor?

00:22:16,505 --> 00:22:18,473
That's a lot of blood.

00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:24,012
All right. I'll see
what I can find out.

00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,647
Hey. Nick and Dr. Ray

00:22:25,714 --> 00:22:26,948
are finishing up
at the Herson place.

00:22:27,015 --> 00:22:28,517
I figured I might be able
to help out here.

00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:30,719
Highway Patrol
just found Herson's car

00:22:30,785 --> 00:22:33,622
overheated and abandoned
off the 160, outside of Pahrump.

00:22:33,688 --> 00:22:35,090
Any idea who...

00:22:43,365 --> 00:22:45,734
(computer beeps)
(typing)

00:22:45,801 --> 00:22:47,235
(sighs)

00:22:47,302 --> 00:22:49,437
I take it you're
playing a hunch?

00:22:49,504 --> 00:22:50,672
Uh-huh.

00:22:50,739 --> 00:22:54,576
What is the mascot for
Pahrump Nye County High School?

00:22:54,643 --> 00:22:56,645
Uh, the bulldog.

00:22:59,915 --> 00:23:01,049
I thought so.

00:23:02,818 --> 00:23:04,352
Herson knows a woman
in West Pahrump.

00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:07,289
The residence
is number 28128...

00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:08,857
I can't see the street.

00:23:08,924 --> 00:23:11,226
Well, there can't be too many
houses in that district

00:23:11,293 --> 00:23:12,127
with that number.

00:23:12,194 --> 00:23:13,895
No, there can't.

00:23:21,837 --> 00:23:22,938
WOMAN (distorted):
Those men outside,

00:23:23,004 --> 00:23:24,306
they're going to hurt you

00:23:24,372 --> 00:23:26,308
if you don't do what they say.

00:23:26,374 --> 00:23:28,810
You-you've always been
a good boy, Jackie, and I...

00:23:28,877 --> 00:23:32,214
I know that whatever you did,
you-you must have had a reason.

00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,450
Mr. Herson, we've got
the place surrounded.

00:23:35,517 --> 00:23:37,185
You know there's no way
you can escape.

00:23:37,252 --> 00:23:38,854
Why don't you pick up the phone
and talk to us?

00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,190
Stupid dog.
I understand.

00:23:42,257 --> 00:23:44,226
HERSON:
Stupid dog!

00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:46,428
Sir, the house belongs
to Nell Porter,

00:23:46,495 --> 00:23:48,797
a retired schoolteacher
and Herson's aunt.

00:23:48,864 --> 00:23:51,133
Yeah. There's something
wrong with that guy.

00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:52,434
HERSON:
Barking! Barking!

00:23:52,501 --> 00:23:53,668
No kidding, sir.
No, no.

00:23:53,735 --> 00:23:55,203
I mean his behavior.
Look at that.

00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,672
He just kept barking
and barking and barking.

00:24:02,978 --> 00:24:04,779
Hold on a second.

00:24:04,846 --> 00:24:06,515
What is it?

00:24:09,117 --> 00:24:11,186
The radiator
plug's missing.
So?

00:24:11,253 --> 00:24:12,888
So, if you turned on the heat,

00:24:12,954 --> 00:24:14,956
you'd flood the whole place.

00:24:16,158 --> 00:24:19,628
Somewhat imprecise for
a precision machinist.

00:24:19,694 --> 00:24:21,696
Hang on to that.

00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:25,901
Fresh tool marks.

00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:27,969
This has been
wrenched off recently.

00:24:30,405 --> 00:24:31,840
Hang on a sec.

00:24:31,907 --> 00:24:33,842
The last time Jekyll killed,

00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:37,312
he took a souvenir
from the victim's house.

00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:39,247
And he left...

00:24:39,314 --> 00:24:41,817
Oh, please put the gun down!

00:24:41,883 --> 00:24:45,053
(crying):
Oh, please put the gun down,
Jackie.

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,255
HERSON:
There's something wrong
with my head.

00:24:58,433 --> 00:24:59,701
OFFICER:
Mr. Herson, please.

00:24:59,768 --> 00:25:01,303
Why don't you let your aunt
come on out?

00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:04,072
(gunshot)
(screams)

00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:05,974
Go, go, go, go.
OFFICER: We have a go.

00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:08,443
(static crackles)
Move! Move it!

00:25:09,611 --> 00:25:10,579
(keypad beeping)

00:25:10,645 --> 00:25:13,148
Gita.

00:25:13,215 --> 00:25:15,283
11:32.

00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,921
Go! Let's go!

00:25:19,988 --> 00:25:21,423
It's a passage

00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,891
<i>from the</i> Bhagavad Gita.

00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:25,293
OFFICER:
Let me see the hands.
Get the hands up, sir!

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,896
The words that went through
Robert Oppenheimer's mind

00:25:27,963 --> 00:25:29,231
after he witnessed

00:25:29,297 --> 00:25:31,733
<i>the first atomic bomb test.</i>

00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,168
Stop moving now!

00:25:33,235 --> 00:25:35,570
<i>"Now I am become Death,</i>

00:25:35,637 --> 00:25:38,907
<i>the Destroyer of Worlds."</i>

00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:42,043
Herson isn't Jekyll.

00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,179
No.

00:25:44,246 --> 00:25:47,182
He's another victim.

00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:13,625
STOKES:
<i>Dr. Jekyll performed</i>
<i>his first operation</i>

00:26:13,692 --> 00:26:15,994
<i>on an already dead</i>
<i>street performer</i>

00:26:16,061 --> 00:26:18,430
<i>by inserting a laparoscope</i>
<i>into the corpse</i>

00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:21,199
<i>and tying his intestines</i>

00:26:21,266 --> 00:26:23,168
<i>into a bow around his spleen.</i>

00:26:23,235 --> 00:26:26,504
WILLOWS:
<i>However, his second victim</i>
<i>was very much alive</i>

00:26:26,571 --> 00:26:28,540
<i>when Jekyll sewed</i>
<i>a septic appendix</i>

00:26:28,607 --> 00:26:31,209
<i>to his ascending colon.</i>

00:26:31,276 --> 00:26:32,510
<i>In both cases,</i>

00:26:32,577 --> 00:26:34,412
<i>Jekyll gave his victim</i>
<i>something and then took</i>

00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:35,747
<i>a similar souvenir.</i>

00:26:37,082 --> 00:26:41,720
Joey Bigelow got
a bow-tied intestine,

00:26:41,786 --> 00:26:45,357
and then Jekyll took
his actual bow tie.

00:26:45,423 --> 00:26:49,327
STOKES:
<i>And Bernard Higgins</i>
<i>received an extra appendix</i>

00:26:49,394 --> 00:26:53,331
<i>in exchange for a word</i>
<i>from the appendix of his book.</i>

00:26:53,398 --> 00:26:54,766
And now it appears

00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:58,570
that Dr. Jekyll has taken
Jack Herson's radiator plug.

00:26:58,637 --> 00:27:01,306
Mm-hmm.

00:27:01,373 --> 00:27:03,375
But in exchange for what?

00:27:07,379 --> 00:27:09,514
What do you know?

00:27:09,581 --> 00:27:11,550
Oh...

00:27:11,616 --> 00:27:13,251
He's wearing a rug.

00:27:13,318 --> 00:27:14,920
Oh.

00:27:14,986 --> 00:27:18,423
Human hair hand-tied
to a fine lace front

00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,392
to hide the hair line.

00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:22,460
Quality carpet.

00:27:23,662 --> 00:27:25,730
LANGSTON:
He's got stitches.

00:27:25,797 --> 00:27:27,866
PHILLIPS:
They look fresh.

00:27:27,933 --> 00:27:29,935
They are.

00:27:32,671 --> 00:27:34,606
What is that?

00:27:34,673 --> 00:27:37,142
It's super-bright.

00:27:37,209 --> 00:27:38,643
May be a bullet.

00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,712
Give me another view.

00:27:43,415 --> 00:27:44,749
I can't even see any edges.

00:27:44,816 --> 00:27:47,352
And the image
isn't moving at all.

00:27:51,022 --> 00:27:53,158
Could it be radiating energy?

00:27:57,662 --> 00:28:00,398
Radiator.

00:28:00,465 --> 00:28:02,467
It's radioactive.

00:28:04,636 --> 00:28:06,671
(Geiger counter clicking
rapidly)

00:28:06,738 --> 00:28:09,074
(saw buzzing)

00:28:16,882 --> 00:28:18,950
ROBBINS:
<i>Looks like Dr. Jekyll</i>
<i>drilled a hole</i>

00:28:19,017 --> 00:28:21,419
<i>in the top of Herson's skull,</i>

00:28:21,486 --> 00:28:23,421
<i>inserted a hollow needle</i>
<i>between the brain hemispheres</i>

00:28:23,488 --> 00:28:25,624
<i>and into the septum pellucidum,</i>

00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,059
<i>and then shoved</i>
<i>radioactive material in</i>

00:28:28,126 --> 00:28:30,695
<i>like peas through a straw.</i>

00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,932
They're radiation seeds.

00:28:33,999 --> 00:28:37,502
Don't worry.
It's a lead-infused acrylic.

00:28:37,569 --> 00:28:38,803
STOKES:
Yeah, I've heard of these.

00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:41,139
They're used
to treat cancer.

00:28:41,206 --> 00:28:43,141
Herson didn't have cancer.
No.

00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:45,343
The radiation severely damaged
the area of the brain

00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,579
that's involved
with mood changes,

00:28:47,646 --> 00:28:49,748
sexual gratification and rage.

00:28:49,814 --> 00:28:51,116
LANGSTON:
In the 1950s,

00:28:51,183 --> 00:28:53,852
researchers induced
similar lesions in rats.

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,321
It produced
"septal rage."
These creatures

00:28:56,388 --> 00:29:00,192
would attack each other savagely
with the slightest provocation.

00:29:00,258 --> 00:29:03,228
Are we saying that Herson isn't
responsible for his murders?

00:29:03,295 --> 00:29:05,964
No. But he might not have
been aware of what he was doing.

00:29:06,031 --> 00:29:07,866
I'll bet he didn't even realize
he'd been operated on.

00:29:07,933 --> 00:29:11,870
Jekyll's anesthetic
of choice is ketamine.

00:29:11,937 --> 00:29:15,207
Herson would've come to
with his rug back in place,

00:29:15,273 --> 00:29:19,211
<i>disoriented, and unable</i>
<i>to remember what happened.</i>

00:29:35,627 --> 00:29:38,230
SIDLE:
<i>According to his medical</i>
<i>records, he called his HMO,</i>

00:29:38,296 --> 00:29:39,731
<i>complaining</i>
<i>of severe headaches.</i>

00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:41,132
<i>They said that they couldn't</i>

00:29:41,199 --> 00:29:42,701
<i>schedule an appointment</i>
<i>until next week.</i>

00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:43,869
<i>He threw a tantrum.</i>

00:29:43,935 --> 00:29:46,104
<i>They said</i>
<i>that he sounded drunk.</i>

00:29:46,171 --> 00:29:48,106
(grunting angrily)

00:29:48,173 --> 00:29:50,508
(dog barking)

00:29:50,575 --> 00:29:52,577
(barking grows louder)

00:29:57,682 --> 00:30:00,886
LANGSTON:
<i>Maybe the dog barking</i>
<i>was the final straw.</i>

00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,722
(panting nervously)

00:30:09,094 --> 00:30:10,629
(gun cocking)

00:30:14,132 --> 00:30:16,101
I'm sorry.

00:30:16,167 --> 00:30:18,537
(agonized groans)

00:30:18,603 --> 00:30:19,704
STOKES:
<i>And not killing Gracie</i>

00:30:19,771 --> 00:30:22,607
was the last shred
of humanity he could muster.

00:30:22,674 --> 00:30:24,209
WILLOWS:
Three weeks ago,

00:30:24,276 --> 00:30:26,378
Jack Herson made
a cash deposit of $5,000.

00:30:26,444 --> 00:30:28,313
The very next day,

00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,082
he drew up plans
for the stereotactic unit

00:30:31,149 --> 00:30:33,218
and placed an order

00:30:33,285 --> 00:30:34,819
for medical-grade titanium.

00:30:34,886 --> 00:30:36,721
So, Jekyll
gives Herson the money

00:30:36,788 --> 00:30:38,623
to build the device,
and then, when it's finished,

00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,992
he turns around and
uses it on its maker?

00:30:41,059 --> 00:30:43,929
I've seen my share of sickos,
but this is severely twisted.

00:30:43,995 --> 00:30:46,398
Dr. Jekyll is a classic sadist.

00:30:46,464 --> 00:30:48,633
He designs
his operations

00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,337
so his victims suffer
slow, agonizing deaths.

00:30:52,404 --> 00:30:55,607
Well, we have Herson's contacts
and emails.

00:30:55,674 --> 00:30:59,211
I know it's brute force,
but if we can figure out

00:30:59,277 --> 00:31:02,647
where or how Herson and Jekyll
could have crossed paths,

00:31:02,714 --> 00:31:03,882
it could lead us to him.

00:31:03,949 --> 00:31:05,350
This is Jekyll's
third time at bat.

00:31:05,417 --> 00:31:07,152
He doesn't seem to be
getting any sloppier.

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,824
Well, he did leave these.

00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,831
(radioactive beads pulsing
photons of gamma radiation)

00:31:19,898 --> 00:31:22,334
(Geiger counter clicking)

00:31:28,306 --> 00:31:30,308
(clicking continues)

00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,479
Why did I just receive 17 pages

00:31:34,546 --> 00:31:37,282
of federal forms to fill out
with your name on it?

00:31:37,349 --> 00:31:38,517
Have you ever tried to locate

00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:41,353
a high-purity germanium
gamma ray detector at 4:00

00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:42,521
on a Friday
in Las Vegas?

00:31:42,587 --> 00:31:43,955
WILLOWS:
No.

00:31:44,022 --> 00:31:46,157
I assumed you wanted the
analysis as quickly as possible,

00:31:46,224 --> 00:31:50,262
and I'm happy to tell you
that the implants

00:31:50,328 --> 00:31:54,499
showed gamma spikes
characteristic of iridium 192.

00:31:54,566 --> 00:31:57,035
Iridium 192?

00:31:57,102 --> 00:31:59,437
That's used in high dose rate
cancer therapy.

00:31:59,504 --> 00:32:03,074
It also has half-life
of 73.827 days,

00:32:03,141 --> 00:32:06,044
which means that a simple
decay rate calculation

00:32:06,111 --> 00:32:08,380
can accurately determine
when it was manufactured.

00:32:08,446 --> 00:32:10,048
I take it you've performed
this calculation?

00:32:10,115 --> 00:32:11,216
Of course.

00:32:11,283 --> 00:32:12,250
But there's more...

00:32:12,317 --> 00:32:13,718
This gamma signature

00:32:13,785 --> 00:32:17,722
indicates that the pellet
also contained gold.

00:32:17,789 --> 00:32:19,891
The only commercially
available iridium pellets

00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:23,228
with gold substrates
are from Nosumi BioMed,

00:32:23,295 --> 00:32:26,298
which manufactured these seeds
13 days ago for delivery

00:32:26,364 --> 00:32:29,701
to Saint Sebastian's Hospital,
in care of a Dr. William Burke.

00:32:29,768 --> 00:32:31,803
I'll tell you what he says.

00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,239
Well done, David Hodges.

00:32:36,308 --> 00:32:38,276
And, uh, you can tell
Homeland Security

00:32:38,343 --> 00:32:40,545
that the quantity
of radioactive material in this

00:32:40,612 --> 00:32:42,280
is infinitesimal
and poses no threat.

00:32:42,347 --> 00:32:44,850
Oh, you can tell them.

00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:46,184
Hang on a second. No.

00:32:46,251 --> 00:32:48,453
If-if the radiation source
is infinitesimal,

00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,121
why are you wearing
three lead aprons?

00:32:50,188 --> 00:32:52,057
Despite my aversion
to children,

00:32:52,123 --> 00:32:53,258
sperm count.

00:33:01,433 --> 00:33:05,136
Gentlemen, it, uh...
seems you're correct.

00:33:05,203 --> 00:33:08,707
We received 40 iridium seeds
from the manufacturer last week.

00:33:08,773 --> 00:33:10,308
My physicist just

00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:14,279
counted them
in the storage room, and...

00:33:14,346 --> 00:33:16,281
we are ten short.

00:33:16,348 --> 00:33:18,817
Do you know what
happened to them?
Not yet,

00:33:18,884 --> 00:33:21,253
but I promise you we will.
It's possible

00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:22,954
it's a clerical error.
It's also possible

00:33:23,021 --> 00:33:23,989
someone stole them.

00:33:24,055 --> 00:33:25,423
What for?

00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:27,692
You can't make a dirty bomb
out of them,

00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:29,327
and they won't get you high.

00:33:30,996 --> 00:33:32,797
Have we met?

00:33:32,864 --> 00:33:35,667
No, I don't believe we have.

00:33:35,734 --> 00:33:39,104
Why are a homicide detective

00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:41,106
and a CSI investigating

00:33:41,172 --> 00:33:43,642
a discrepancy in our inventory?

00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:45,810
Your iridium seeds
were used by a killer.

00:33:45,877 --> 00:33:48,647
A person with sophisticated
surgical skills.

00:33:48,713 --> 00:33:50,749
Sounds like a modern-day
Jack the Ripper.

00:33:50,815 --> 00:33:52,684
The perpetrator's not
a simple cutter.

00:33:52,751 --> 00:33:55,287
Two days ago, he used
a custom-built

00:33:55,353 --> 00:33:57,722
stereotactic device
to insert your pellets

00:33:57,789 --> 00:33:59,524
into a man's septum.

00:33:59,591 --> 00:34:01,660
The ensuing brain damage
caused the victim

00:34:01,726 --> 00:34:04,095
to kill three people
before he died himself.

00:34:04,162 --> 00:34:05,130
You're kidding.

00:34:05,197 --> 00:34:06,531
No, I'm not.

00:34:06,598 --> 00:34:08,366
Dr. Burke,

00:34:08,433 --> 00:34:10,135
we're gonna need
a detailed account

00:34:10,202 --> 00:34:12,971
of your whereabouts in
the last several days.

00:34:13,038 --> 00:34:14,940
Mostly here.

00:34:18,143 --> 00:34:20,011
Am I a suspect?

00:34:20,078 --> 00:34:21,580
We're just following
our leads, Doc.

00:34:21,646 --> 00:34:23,348
Actually, we're trying
to rule you out.

00:34:23,415 --> 00:34:25,450
Right.

00:34:25,517 --> 00:34:28,620
My secretary can give you
that information.

00:34:28,687 --> 00:34:29,955
If you'll excuse me,

00:34:30,021 --> 00:34:31,423
I have a patient
with prostate cancer.

00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:33,124
I have to tell him that

00:34:33,191 --> 00:34:35,093
his surgery has
been delayed.

00:34:39,931 --> 00:34:41,199
I got it.

00:34:41,266 --> 00:34:43,335
Raymond Langston--
you wrote that book

00:34:43,401 --> 00:34:46,404
about the Angel of Death
at Delaware General.

00:34:46,471 --> 00:34:47,772
(chuckles):
Oh, yeah!

00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,941
You'd love it if
I was the killer.

00:34:50,008 --> 00:34:51,443
Then you could
write a sequel

00:34:51,509 --> 00:34:53,745
about another psychopathic
doctor murdering his patients,

00:34:53,812 --> 00:34:56,081
<i>and</i> use it as an
excuse to indict

00:34:56,147 --> 00:34:57,749
the entire medical
establishment again.

00:34:57,816 --> 00:35:00,085
Well, obviously, you didn't read
very clearly or carefully.

00:35:00,151 --> 00:35:02,387
I was examining my own
failures in the book.

00:35:02,454 --> 00:35:05,290
Interesting how
your soul-searching
managed to imply

00:35:05,357 --> 00:35:07,325
that everyone else
was incompetent.

00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,094
You took one rogue surgeon

00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,162
and vilified
an entire profession.

00:35:11,229 --> 00:35:13,932
I saw their mistakes
in the morgue, Doctor.

00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:15,433
I wrote what I saw.

00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,570
I don't suffer the illusion
that all surgeons walk on water.

00:35:18,637 --> 00:35:21,806
You know, Ray,
I think were not needed here.

00:35:21,873 --> 00:35:23,341
I think we're all done.

00:35:23,408 --> 00:35:25,043
Thanks for your time, Doctor.
Mm-hmm.

00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,111
Let's go.

00:35:26,177 --> 00:35:27,779
Uh, you sound a
little envious.

00:35:27,846 --> 00:35:28,847
Why is that?

00:35:28,914 --> 00:35:30,582
Because you didn't
have what it takes

00:35:30,649 --> 00:35:32,884
to cut into a living,
breathing human being

00:35:32,951 --> 00:35:34,252
and try and save
their lives?

00:35:34,319 --> 00:35:35,620
Being a pathologist is easier.

00:35:35,687 --> 00:35:36,922
Your patients are already dead.

00:35:36,988 --> 00:35:38,757
It's kind of like being a CSI,

00:35:38,823 --> 00:35:40,225
I guess, right?

00:35:40,292 --> 00:35:41,293
You're perfect for the job.

00:35:42,027 --> 00:35:43,595
(loud bang)
Aah!

00:35:43,662 --> 00:35:45,597
(groans in pain, pants)

00:35:45,664 --> 00:35:47,232
Now you've got a problem.

00:35:47,299 --> 00:35:49,000
(groans)

00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:07,377
So, the good doctor
saw the light,

00:36:07,444 --> 00:36:10,246
and he's agreed not
to press charges for assault.

00:36:10,313 --> 00:36:12,916
I convinced him that
a very public investigation

00:36:12,982 --> 00:36:16,019
into how he lost potentially
dangerous radioactive material

00:36:16,086 --> 00:36:18,955
may impact negatively
on his insurance liability,

00:36:19,022 --> 00:36:20,750
both for him and his hospital.

00:36:20,817 --> 00:36:22,785
So he calmed down and...

00:36:22,852 --> 00:36:25,088
actually became
kind of reasonable.

00:36:25,154 --> 00:36:28,891
So I said we'll chalk
it up to an accident.

00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:31,961
It was an accident, right?

00:36:33,262 --> 00:36:35,732
Yeah. Look, Ray, I mean,
I've known you long enough

00:36:35,798 --> 00:36:38,234
to know that you don't
like to get any advice,

00:36:38,301 --> 00:36:40,269
but I'm gonna give you
some anyway, okay?

00:36:40,336 --> 00:36:43,973
You know, if this song-and-dance
here that you did was

00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,808
because you're frustrated
about the Jekyll killer,

00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:47,377
I understand that.
I get it.

00:36:47,443 --> 00:36:49,879
But if it has to do
with something...

00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:52,915
from the past, some old,
unfinished business,

00:36:52,982 --> 00:36:55,218
something from way back when...

00:36:55,284 --> 00:36:58,154
I suggest you drop it,

00:36:58,221 --> 00:37:01,057
'cause it's not working for you.

00:37:02,892 --> 00:37:05,228
That's all I'm gonna say.

00:37:13,536 --> 00:37:17,340
SECURITY DIRECTOR:
All of the restricted areas in
the hospital have keypad locks.

00:37:17,407 --> 00:37:19,575
To gain access,
I assume all your people

00:37:19,642 --> 00:37:21,444
have to enter their
personal code.
Exactly.

00:37:21,511 --> 00:37:23,179
Our system tracks
every time and place

00:37:23,246 --> 00:37:24,680
one of those codes is used.

00:37:24,747 --> 00:37:26,883
Now, these surveillance photos
were taken at the door

00:37:26,949 --> 00:37:28,551
to the nuclear medicine
storage room.

00:37:28,618 --> 00:37:30,787
That's where we keep
those radioactive seeds.

00:37:30,853 --> 00:37:34,023
STOKES:
Mm-hmm. And these are
the people who entered

00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,325
during the time period
the seeds went missing?

00:37:36,392 --> 00:37:38,094
SECURITY DIRECTOR:
Mm-hmm.

00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:39,595
(typing)

00:37:40,897 --> 00:37:42,498
Hmm.

00:37:42,565 --> 00:37:43,666
Huh, what is it?

00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:45,001
This man used

00:37:45,068 --> 00:37:46,836
Dr. Davis's I.D. code.
Only one problem:

00:37:46,903 --> 00:37:48,871
Dr. Davis is a five-foot-two

00:37:48,938 --> 00:37:50,840
African-American woman,
and she's in Hawaii.

00:37:50,907 --> 00:37:54,210
Has that code been used anywhere
else in the hospital since then?

00:37:54,277 --> 00:37:55,411
Uh, searching.

00:37:55,478 --> 00:37:56,546
(typing)

00:37:56,612 --> 00:37:58,347
(computer beeps)

00:37:58,414 --> 00:38:00,917
It was used
four minutes ago.

00:38:00,983 --> 00:38:05,621
Where?
A surgical supply locker
on the fifth floor.

00:38:05,688 --> 00:38:06,756
Get on the phone,
lock down the building.
Lock it down!

00:38:06,823 --> 00:38:08,257
Hey, what's going on?

00:38:08,324 --> 00:38:09,859
Dr. Jekyll's here--
fifth floor.

00:38:09,926 --> 00:38:11,260
Control, this is
Charlie 03 Stokes.

00:38:11,327 --> 00:38:13,162
I need four units containment,
Saint Sebastian Hospital.

00:38:13,229 --> 00:38:14,564
You sure he's
in the building?

00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:17,166
Yeah, he was in a lab coat
and a surgical mask.

00:38:17,233 --> 00:38:19,569
So are half of
the people in here.

00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,907
(both panting)

00:38:24,974 --> 00:38:26,909
You go east; I'll go west.

00:38:26,976 --> 00:38:28,311
Yeah.

Excuse me.

Everyone, I'm a crime scene
investigator with the Vegas PD.

00:38:54,904 --> 00:38:57,273
I need everyone to remove
their masks for me, please.

00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,342
Are you out of your mind?
This is a sterile area!

00:38:59,409 --> 00:39:00,843
And I'm in pursuit
of a murder suspect.

00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,011
Take it off.

00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:03,413
Take if off!
That goes for

00:39:03,479 --> 00:39:05,281
the rest of you, too.
Get them off.

00:39:05,348 --> 00:39:06,416
Identify each other.
