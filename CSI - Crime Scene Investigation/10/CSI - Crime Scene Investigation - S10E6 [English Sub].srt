00:00:02,542 --> 00:00:03,943
(panting, grunting)

00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:07,780
(screams)

00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,586
(grunting, gagging)

00:00:13,653 --> 00:00:14,654
(punches landing)

00:00:16,188 --> 00:00:18,357
(coughing)

00:00:22,728 --> 00:00:23,763
(groans)

00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:31,871
(screaming)

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:41,981
STOKES:
What's his status?

00:00:42,048 --> 00:00:46,085
He has multiple contusions
and severe lacerations.

00:00:46,152 --> 00:00:48,854
You know, I should follow
and process this kid.

00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:50,456
I'll be back soon as I can.

00:00:50,523 --> 00:00:51,691
Still be here.

00:00:51,757 --> 00:00:53,793
All right.

00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:55,127
WOMAN:
I swear.

00:00:55,194 --> 00:00:57,630
I swear on the
Bible, the Koran

00:00:57,697 --> 00:00:59,432
and a whole stack
of police badges,

00:00:59,498 --> 00:01:01,033
I ain't do
nothing wrong.

00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,602
Then what are you
doing in the alley?

00:01:02,668 --> 00:01:04,170
Looking for my kitty.

00:01:04,237 --> 00:01:05,171
She's lost.

00:01:05,238 --> 00:01:06,472
What's your cat's name?

00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:07,840
Pussy cat.

00:01:07,907 --> 00:01:09,609
Yeah, now why
didn't I know that?

00:01:09,675 --> 00:01:11,711
Okay, the victim's name
is Tommy Baker.

00:01:11,777 --> 00:01:12,845
He's a local kid.

00:01:12,912 --> 00:01:14,547
Somebody beat the crap
out of him.

00:01:14,614 --> 00:01:16,115
WILLOWS:
Business deal gone wrong?

00:01:16,182 --> 00:01:17,283
What's with all the blood?

00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,418
Don't take that tone
with me, Blondie.

00:01:19,485 --> 00:01:21,120
This is the blood
on an innocent Samaritan.

00:01:21,187 --> 00:01:22,521
BRASS:
Oh, yeah, we got a special

00:01:22,588 --> 00:01:23,556
on Samaritans.

00:01:23,623 --> 00:01:24,690
We're arresting
them tonight.

00:01:24,757 --> 00:01:25,725
That's you,
your pimp...

00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,627
Hey-hey-hey-hey-
hey-hey-hey-hey.

00:01:27,693 --> 00:01:29,562
I got to work tonight,
so here's the straight.

00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:31,797
I was in the alley
with my boyfriend.

00:01:31,864 --> 00:01:33,065
I got some
good stuff for you.

00:01:33,132 --> 00:01:34,500
Oh, oh.

00:01:34,567 --> 00:01:36,636
Oh, Lord Almighty.

00:01:36,702 --> 00:01:38,738
Honey, honey?

00:01:38,804 --> 00:01:39,906
Are you okay?

00:01:39,972 --> 00:01:41,440
It looked like somebody

00:01:41,507 --> 00:01:42,975
put him in a blender
or something.

00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:44,410
Where'd your boyfriend go?

00:01:44,477 --> 00:01:45,411
He ran off.

00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:47,346
I don't know.

00:01:47,413 --> 00:01:49,315
Didn't even scrape me off a tip,
but that's okay,

00:01:49,382 --> 00:01:50,349
because I got
his number.

00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:51,417
(chuckles):
Okay.

00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:00,026
Excuse me. I'm looking
for Tommy Baker.

00:02:00,092 --> 00:02:01,327
Yeah, right down there.

00:02:01,394 --> 00:02:03,062
Thanks.

00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,533
Excuse me.

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,035
Hey, are you with
the crime lab?

00:02:09,101 --> 00:02:10,536
Yes, sir.
Hey, I'm Mark.

00:02:10,603 --> 00:02:11,704
I'm Tommy's older brother.

00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:13,272
Nick Stokes.

00:02:13,339 --> 00:02:14,507
He's pretty whacked out.

00:02:14,574 --> 00:02:16,442
It's hard to look at
his face, you know?

00:02:17,944 --> 00:02:19,412
Hey, excuse me.

00:02:19,478 --> 00:02:21,581
When are we gonna
be able to see a doctor?

00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:24,016
Nobody will
talk to me.

00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,018
Doctor hasn't even been
in to see Tommy yet.

00:02:26,085 --> 00:02:27,687
You look like
you could use a break.

00:02:27,753 --> 00:02:29,956
There's a pretty decent vending
machine down the hallway.

00:02:30,022 --> 00:02:31,257
Why don't you go grab something?

00:02:31,324 --> 00:02:32,959
I'll stay
with your brother.

00:02:33,025 --> 00:02:33,960
All right.
Okay?

00:02:34,026 --> 00:02:35,695
Yeah.

00:02:45,338 --> 00:02:47,340
Mr. Baker.

00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:50,776
I'm Nick Stokes.

00:02:50,843 --> 00:02:52,311
I'm a crime scene
investigator.

00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:56,782
I'm here to photograph your
injuries, collect trace and...

00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:59,752
later, I'll take your
clothes from you.

00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,788
I'm sure you want to catch
whoever did this to you.

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,662
Can you tell me
what happened?

00:03:12,832 --> 00:03:14,834
Do you know who
did this to you?

00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:21,941
(Tommy screaming)

00:03:24,176 --> 00:03:26,746
Get the hell out of here!
Huh?!

00:03:26,812 --> 00:03:28,180
Leave me the hell alone!

That was fast.

00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:13,073
Yeah, I think we might
have a P-Paul.

00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:15,842
Victim won't cooperate?

00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:18,511
Mr. Baker went a little nuts,
busted my camera.

00:04:18,578 --> 00:04:20,313
Is he on something?

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,082
Nah, I think
he's just traumatized.

00:04:22,148 --> 00:04:24,951
I'm gonna have
the hospital call me

00:04:25,018 --> 00:04:28,054
after the doctors
examine him.

00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:29,723
What is going on here?

00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:33,460
I found five separate
bloodletting incidents.

00:04:33,526 --> 00:04:36,396
Blood spatter, blood
spray, drag marks.

00:04:36,463 --> 00:04:38,465
Whew.

00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:44,904
How come all the blood
over here is still wet,

00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:46,306
but this blood's dry?

00:04:46,372 --> 00:04:47,307
Well, this wasn't
a hit-and-run,

00:04:47,373 --> 00:04:48,575
this went on
for a while.

00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:50,877
I found some
semen here.

00:04:50,944 --> 00:04:52,946
Hooker alley.

00:04:53,012 --> 00:04:54,647
You'd think I
would've found more.

00:04:54,714 --> 00:04:56,716
Mm-hmm.

00:05:02,489 --> 00:05:03,957
Are you done taking overalls?

00:05:04,023 --> 00:05:05,658
Yeah, all clear.

00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:12,165
A Saint Christopher medal

00:05:12,232 --> 00:05:13,767
with blood on it?

00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,735
Could belong to the victim.

00:05:15,802 --> 00:05:18,671
Yeah, it didn't do him
much good, did it?

00:05:18,738 --> 00:05:21,674
That's because he's
the patron saint of travel.

00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:24,577
Eddie always used to have one
hanging on his rear-view.

00:05:24,644 --> 00:05:26,546
Didn't help him much, either.

00:05:33,486 --> 00:05:36,856
Yup. No, I'm staring
at it right now.

00:05:36,923 --> 00:05:38,858
No. All right,
sprinklers are off.

00:05:38,925 --> 00:05:40,226
Thank you.

00:05:40,293 --> 00:05:43,930
Fire department finally tracked
down the main water line.

00:05:43,997 --> 00:05:46,066
Okay, KQUT traffic chopper
spotted smoke

00:05:46,132 --> 00:05:47,467
on their morning flyover
around 8:00.

00:05:47,534 --> 00:05:48,468
Store doesn't open till 9:00.

00:05:48,535 --> 00:05:49,969
Did you happen
to notice

00:05:50,036 --> 00:05:51,704
whether or not this was the fire
department's handiwork here?

00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:54,441
You mean the evidence
eradication crew.

00:05:54,507 --> 00:05:56,676
VARTANN:
They never checked to see
if it was unlocked.

00:05:56,743 --> 00:05:58,111
They said that there was
so much smoke

00:05:58,178 --> 00:06:00,346
that they had to do
a hatchet job on it anyway.

00:06:00,413 --> 00:06:02,482
I'm going to canvass the
neighborhood, see if anybody

00:06:02,549 --> 00:06:04,050
saw anything.

00:06:04,117 --> 00:06:06,453
Excuse me.

00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,855
Think we have a camera
in the ceiling down here.

00:06:21,935 --> 00:06:23,636
Victim's only lightly toasted.

00:06:23,703 --> 00:06:26,206
If someone was trying
to burn this place down,

00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:27,640
they didn't do
a very good job.

00:06:27,707 --> 00:06:30,477
And a seasoned arsonist would've
disabled the sprinklers.

00:06:30,543 --> 00:06:33,379
The fire was probably
an afterthought,

00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:35,782
just an attempt to
destroy any evidence.

00:06:43,256 --> 00:06:45,592
Hmm.

00:06:45,658 --> 00:06:47,861
This camera's
not just a live feed,

00:06:47,927 --> 00:06:49,763
it's a surveillance camera.

00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:51,364
Means there's
got to be a console

00:06:51,431 --> 00:06:53,032
around here somewhere.

00:06:59,572 --> 00:07:02,308
I think I found it.

00:07:08,248 --> 00:07:09,182
Tape's missing.

00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:11,017
How surprising.

00:07:11,084 --> 00:07:12,952
Hey. I'm so sorry I'm late.

00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:14,988
Just drove in from Pahrump.

00:07:15,055 --> 00:07:17,190
Sara's got a
quintuple in a motel.

00:07:17,257 --> 00:07:18,191
She's gonna be there for days.

00:07:18,258 --> 00:07:19,259
(chuckles)

00:07:26,866 --> 00:07:28,301
Your vic's only been dead

00:07:28,368 --> 00:07:29,369
a couple of hours.

00:07:30,637 --> 00:07:32,572
Oh.

00:07:36,142 --> 00:07:38,278
We got two GSWs
to the upper torso.

00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:41,815
Not through-and-throughs.

00:07:41,881 --> 00:07:43,817
SANDERS:
Wayne Smith, 26.

00:07:43,883 --> 00:07:45,318
Lives in the area.

00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:51,091
Wayne Smith, proprietor.

00:07:51,157 --> 00:07:52,459
So Wayne's here

00:07:52,525 --> 00:07:56,162
getting ready to open up
the store, somebody comes in.

00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:58,131
Or somebody's here already.

00:07:59,232 --> 00:08:00,366
(doorbell chimes)

00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:07,006
Botched burglary?

00:08:07,073 --> 00:08:09,008
Guess it's more than the economy

00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:11,144
that's killing
small business owners.

00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:24,657
(sighs softly)

00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:36,302
Hi.

00:08:36,369 --> 00:08:38,371
I help you?

00:08:38,438 --> 00:08:39,406
Uh, yes, ma'am.

00:08:39,472 --> 00:08:41,040
LVPD. I'm looking
for Tommy Baker.

00:08:41,107 --> 00:08:43,176
(sighs)

00:08:43,243 --> 00:08:44,944
(slurred):
That's my son.

00:08:45,011 --> 00:08:46,379
I'm his mom.

00:08:46,446 --> 00:08:49,182
Can I get you a drink?

00:08:50,216 --> 00:08:52,886
Uh... no.

00:08:52,952 --> 00:08:54,521
No, I'm good.

00:08:54,587 --> 00:08:56,589
Thanks.

00:08:59,893 --> 00:09:01,828
Did you know your son
checked himself out

00:09:01,895 --> 00:09:03,863
of the hospital against
doctor's orders last night,

00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,665
refused treatment?

00:09:05,732 --> 00:09:06,699
(dishes clattering loudly)

00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:08,201
You okay?

00:09:08,268 --> 00:09:10,403
When was he in the hospital?

00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,338
Last night.

00:09:12,405 --> 00:09:14,741
You do know your son was
assaulted last night, don't you?

00:09:14,808 --> 00:09:17,343
Really?

00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,812
(scoffs)

00:09:18,878 --> 00:09:20,447
That boy's always
had a temper!

00:09:20,513 --> 00:09:23,016
I hope that he
kicked some ass!

00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,084
Well, he didn't.

00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,819
Is he around?

00:09:25,885 --> 00:09:27,387
I really need to talk to him.

00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:31,257
Hey.

00:09:31,324 --> 00:09:32,425
Mama, what are you doing here?

00:09:32,492 --> 00:09:33,426
How'd you get in?

00:09:33,493 --> 00:09:34,427
Hey, honey!

00:09:34,494 --> 00:09:35,795
Did you know that Tommy was

00:09:35,862 --> 00:09:37,030
in a fight last night?

00:09:37,097 --> 00:09:38,598
Mark, I'm sorry
to barge in on you

00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:40,233
like this,
but I still need to get

00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,001
your brother's statement,
process him, you know?

00:09:42,068 --> 00:09:43,069
Yeah, sure,
of course.

00:09:43,136 --> 00:09:44,070
But, uh...

00:09:44,137 --> 00:09:45,371
Tommy's asleep.
I'm on my break.

00:09:45,438 --> 00:09:46,906
I came by to check on him.

00:09:46,973 --> 00:09:48,508
Oh, okay.
I'll get him.

00:09:48,575 --> 00:09:50,610
No. Mama, you need to go,
all right?

00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:51,711
Get your hands
off of me!

00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:52,746
You know you're
not welcome here.

00:09:52,812 --> 00:09:54,114
Let's go.
I want to see my baby!

00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,148
Outside!
Take it easy, okay?

00:09:55,215 --> 00:09:56,382
All right, just
give me a minute.

00:09:56,449 --> 00:09:57,917
Just take it easy.
Okay, just give me

00:09:57,984 --> 00:09:58,918
some money, because...
Outside!

00:09:58,985 --> 00:10:00,353
Take it easy!

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,354
Outside, Mom!

00:10:01,421 --> 00:10:03,623
Let's go.

00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,958
That's a police officer,
you know?!

00:10:05,024 --> 00:10:06,292
You are a
piece of work!

00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:07,961
That is an officer
of the law!

00:10:08,027 --> 00:10:10,096
You don't touch
your mama like that!

00:10:10,163 --> 00:10:11,431
I am your mother!

00:10:11,498 --> 00:10:12,699
You're supposed
to respect me!
(knocking)

00:10:12,766 --> 00:10:14,401
(shouting continues faintly)

00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,640
MARK:
Hey, excuse me.

00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:22,709
I didn't say you could
go into my room.

00:10:22,776 --> 00:10:24,577
It's not your room,
it's Tommy's.

00:10:24,644 --> 00:10:25,945
Where is he?

00:10:26,012 --> 00:10:27,414
I don't know.

00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,316
He came home, he took a shower,
he didn't feel like talking,

00:10:30,383 --> 00:10:32,018
then he left
a little before 6:00.

00:10:32,085 --> 00:10:33,319
Figured he went
to his girlfriend's,

00:10:33,386 --> 00:10:35,688
but he's not
answering his cell.

00:10:35,755 --> 00:10:38,725
Look, Mr. Stokes,
I'm sorry about your camera.

00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:40,226
I'm not really worried
about the camera.

00:10:40,293 --> 00:10:42,228
But, believe it or not,
there are other cases

00:10:42,295 --> 00:10:43,430
that could use
my attention.

00:10:43,496 --> 00:10:44,597
You know what I mean?

00:10:44,664 --> 00:10:45,932
I'm not gonna run
all over town

00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:47,300
playing hide and seek
with your brother.

00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:49,202
You have him call me.

00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:50,470
Yeah?
Yeah.

00:10:58,244 --> 00:11:02,415
Cash register's cleaned out,
but there's a .22 in here.

00:11:02,482 --> 00:11:04,217
Most likely belonged
to the victim.

00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:09,089
Two fired cartridges.

00:11:09,155 --> 00:11:10,890
The vic had two gunshot wounds,

00:11:10,957 --> 00:11:14,294
so he probably pulled it out
to defend himself,

00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,529
and then got overpowered.

00:11:16,596 --> 00:11:21,367
But why'd the killer put
the gun back in the register?

00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:24,804
Langston?

00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:27,240
Ray?

00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:31,411
I can answer my own question.

00:11:31,478 --> 00:11:34,547
"You see, Greg, cop pulls you
over and finds cash on you,

00:11:34,614 --> 00:11:35,782
"no big deal.

00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:38,618
"Finds a gun,
then you're going to jail.

00:11:38,685 --> 00:11:42,055
Want to bet it's wiped down?"

00:11:53,466 --> 00:11:55,235
Well, looky here.

00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:58,371
Got a serial number on the
bottom of the cash drawer.

00:11:58,438 --> 00:12:01,241
Lots of mom-and-pops
will record the serial number

00:12:01,307 --> 00:12:05,044
off a 20 and keep it
in the drawer as bait money.

00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:07,881
That way,
in case they get robbed,

00:12:07,947 --> 00:12:10,250
cops have a way to match it.

00:12:10,316 --> 00:12:11,518
"Thanks, Greg."

00:12:11,584 --> 00:12:12,919
No, thank you.

00:12:14,054 --> 00:12:16,723
Back door's dead-bolted.

00:12:21,127 --> 00:12:22,929
Window's unlocked.

00:12:35,508 --> 00:12:41,047
Sometimes when God closes
a door, Satan opens a window.

00:12:41,114 --> 00:12:42,649
(grate creaks)

00:12:43,616 --> 00:12:44,751
I'm glad to
hear I'm not

00:12:44,818 --> 00:12:46,386
the only one who talks
to himself.

00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:50,724
I think I found a point
of entry here.

00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,725
Really?

00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:52,559
Can I help?

00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:53,827
You can start processing

00:12:53,893 --> 00:12:55,595
what's on that side
of the room.

00:12:55,662 --> 00:12:56,863
All right.

00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:12,245
I got a bag here with what
appears to be blood on it.

00:13:23,223 --> 00:13:24,457
Looks like Jack
Sparrow's been here.

00:13:24,524 --> 00:13:27,060
I don't think our vic
was making his living

00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:28,561
from just selling TVs.

00:13:28,628 --> 00:13:30,130
I don't think this was
a random hit.

00:13:30,196 --> 00:13:31,998
Killer knew his way
in and out.

00:13:32,065 --> 00:13:35,034
Also knew
about the surveillance.

00:13:35,101 --> 00:13:37,937
I'm thinking that our suspect
either knew the victim

00:13:38,004 --> 00:13:40,240
or at the very least
knew about his operation.

00:13:40,306 --> 00:13:43,476
Then why'd he take all the cash
and leave the good stuff?

00:13:47,847 --> 00:13:52,252
Do you know
who killed my brother?

00:13:52,318 --> 00:13:54,821
I mean, do you, do you have
any suspects?

00:13:54,888 --> 00:13:55,855
No, none yet.

00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:58,024
Hey, don't worry, okay?

00:13:58,091 --> 00:14:00,293
We're gonna
catch the guy.

00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:03,196
So Wayne lived
at home

00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,431
with you and
your parents?

00:14:04,497 --> 00:14:06,599
No, it's just us.

00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:11,104
Our folks died when I was 13.

00:14:11,171 --> 00:14:14,774
Wayne had to quit school
to keep the store going.

00:14:14,841 --> 00:14:18,011
When's the last time
you saw him?

00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:20,146
He was heading out
when I got up.

00:14:20,213 --> 00:14:21,881
It was around 6:00.
Wayne opens

00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:23,650
during the week
when I'm in school.

00:14:23,716 --> 00:14:25,585
So you work at the store, too?

00:14:26,786 --> 00:14:29,856
Did he empty the cash register
every night?

00:14:29,923 --> 00:14:32,225
No. He only goes to the bank
once a week.

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,261
Can I go now?

00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:37,564
Actually, CSI will need
to get your fingerprints

00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,100
just to exclude
you, okay?

00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,936
And then I can give
you a ride home.

00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,793
Ran a background on Tommy Baker.
Got his juvie record.

00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,194
He was a runaway.

00:15:08,261 --> 00:15:09,195
A drunk mother.

00:15:09,262 --> 00:15:11,598
Oh, I met her.
Still drunk.

00:15:11,664 --> 00:15:14,234
Did a stint
for punching a cop,

00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,602
another for
petty theft.

00:15:15,668 --> 00:15:16,970
He's no angel.

00:15:17,036 --> 00:15:19,305
<i>I'm thinking that</i>
<i>he picked up a hooker...</i>

00:15:19,372 --> 00:15:20,473
That's 50 bucks
extra, baby.

00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,142
Hey-hey-hey-hey-
hey-hey-hey!

00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,209
You think you're gonna get

00:15:23,276 --> 00:15:25,078
some of this sweet stuff
without paying?

00:15:25,145 --> 00:15:27,714
<i>...and her management</i>
<i>beat him up.</i>

00:15:27,781 --> 00:15:29,482
He seems embarrassed about it.

00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:31,885
I think he just wants it
to go away.

00:15:31,951 --> 00:15:33,253
It could be the
same hooker

00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:36,056
who called 911.
Guilty conscience.

00:15:36,122 --> 00:15:37,590
I'll have Brass
pick her up.

00:15:37,657 --> 00:15:39,492
Maybe she'll roll
on her pimp.

00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:41,561
Won't do any good
if Baker won't testify.

00:15:41,628 --> 00:15:44,597
Hey, guys, I just got
the DNA results from the alley.

00:15:44,664 --> 00:15:46,933
All the blood came
from one unknown male.

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,768
I'm assuming that's
probably your victim.

00:15:48,835 --> 00:15:50,670
Reasonable assumption.

00:15:50,737 --> 00:15:52,405
But the fluid was actually
a mixture.

00:15:52,472 --> 00:15:53,540
It was semen and blood.

00:15:53,606 --> 00:15:54,908
So I separated out
the swimmers,

00:15:54,974 --> 00:15:57,143
and a profile came back
to a second unknown male.

00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,478
The blood was
actually a match

00:15:58,545 --> 00:16:00,513
to the rest of the blood
at the scene.

00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,818
So we got the victim's blood
plus an unknown male's semen.

00:16:04,884 --> 00:16:07,087
Maybe the semen was
already there

00:16:07,153 --> 00:16:09,155
and the blood
dropped onto it.

00:16:09,222 --> 00:16:12,826
No, there was
no visible blood on
or near the stain.

00:16:12,892 --> 00:16:16,596
You said that Tommy got violent
when you tried to process him?

00:16:16,663 --> 00:16:18,064
Yeah.

00:16:18,131 --> 00:16:19,699
He refused medical treatment,

00:16:19,766 --> 00:16:22,368
he went home
and showered,

00:16:22,435 --> 00:16:24,337
and according to his brother,

00:16:24,404 --> 00:16:26,706
he wouldn't talk
about what happened.

00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:32,312
If this were a woman,
what would you think?

00:16:33,613 --> 00:16:36,750
I'd think she was raped.

00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,417
WILLOWS:
<i>Excuse me. I'd like to speak</i>
<i>with the nurse</i>

00:16:42,484 --> 00:16:44,286
that admitted
Tommy Baker last night.

00:16:44,352 --> 00:16:45,754
I admitted Mr. Baker.

00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:47,989
Uh, checked the
paparamedicsmedics'
intake sheet;

00:16:48,056 --> 00:16:48,990
nothing life threatening

00:16:49,057 --> 00:16:50,358
so I stuck him
in a room.

00:16:50,425 --> 00:16:51,493
Did he say anything?

00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,795
Just that he got jumped
after leaving a bar.

00:16:53,862 --> 00:16:55,964
And did the paramedics draw
any blood?
They suspected

00:16:56,031 --> 00:16:57,299
drug use, so they pulled
a sample.

00:16:57,365 --> 00:16:59,801
Do you still have that?

00:17:02,904 --> 00:17:04,573
Thank you.

00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:14,616
(knocking)

00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:15,650
Miss Martin,

00:17:15,717 --> 00:17:17,285
Nick Stokes, CSI.

00:17:17,352 --> 00:17:19,020
I got your name
from Captain Brass.

00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:22,591
Who cares if I'm in the middle
of lunch, right?

00:17:22,657 --> 00:17:24,092
I can come back later.

00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:25,861
Mm-mm.
We never get CSI

00:17:25,927 --> 00:17:27,195
in Victim Services.

00:17:27,262 --> 00:17:29,331
Wouldn't want you to waste
a trip. What is it?

00:17:29,397 --> 00:17:33,435
I have a victim who may have
been sexually assaulted, but <i>he</i>

00:17:33,502 --> 00:17:35,604
isn't really in
the mood to talk.

00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,339
"Sexually assaulted,"
as in raped?

00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:38,473
Yeah.

00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,442
Men almost never
report it.

00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:42,043
People think
it's a prison thing,

00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,279
but it's just as likely
to happen on the outside.

00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:45,814
This your first?

00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:48,116
Yeah. Yeah, that's why I'm here,
looking for some insight.

00:17:48,183 --> 00:17:50,218
Your victim was
raped in an alley

00:17:50,285 --> 00:17:52,787
My experience, it means
he probably didn't have

00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:54,789
a strong connection
to his attacker.

00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:56,358
Either they didn't know
each other

00:17:56,424 --> 00:17:57,559
or the connection
was casual.

00:17:57,626 --> 00:17:59,561
And don't be surprised

00:17:59,628 --> 00:18:01,630
if Mr. Baker never admits
he was raped.

00:18:01,696 --> 00:18:04,299
Odds are you'll probably close
the case on lack of cooperation

00:18:04,366 --> 00:18:06,234
and then make fun of him
around the office.

00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:07,969
Have a nice day,
Mr. Stokes.

00:18:08,036 --> 00:18:09,404
What is your problem?

00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:10,405
I'm just trying

00:18:10,472 --> 00:18:11,573
to do my job here.

00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,741
I've watched you guys

00:18:12,807 --> 00:18:14,576
stand over dead bodies
and crack jokes.

00:18:14,643 --> 00:18:16,244
I still see
a human being

00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:17,979
when all you see
is evidence.

00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:19,881
Which might make you
a good investigator,

00:18:19,948 --> 00:18:22,050
but it also makes you
cold, hard people.

00:18:22,117 --> 00:18:25,220
So you can feel compassion
for dead people, but you can't

00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:27,556
feel it for someone who's
alive wearing a badge

00:18:27,622 --> 00:18:28,924
trying to help?

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,159
Good luck with that.
Enjoy your sandwich.

00:18:31,226 --> 00:18:34,863
Best way to get Mr. Baker
to talk

00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,766
is to let him know
that you want to help him,

00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,769
that it's not just a job.

00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:42,103
Give him my card.

00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,773
He might feel more
comfortable talking
to a woman.

00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,743
Keep the other one in case
you have any more questions.

00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:56,718
Okay. Thanks.

00:19:06,127 --> 00:19:07,729
Out with it, Simms.

00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:09,731
What is up with Ecklie?

00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:11,132
Excuse me?

00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:13,768
He said he's not
gonna let anybody else
pull a Sanders.

00:19:13,835 --> 00:19:15,737
I don't get to go out
in the field.

00:19:15,804 --> 00:19:16,738
Ah.

00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:17,939
And the thing
that really

00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:19,975
pisses me off about this...

00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,178
I have recommendation letters
from Grissom, Catherine

00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,412
and Nick in my file.

00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:25,881
It didn't make
any difference to him.

00:19:25,947 --> 00:19:26,948
I mean,
this is ridiculous.

00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:28,316
It's supposed
to be a meritocracy.

00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,285
Since when?

00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:31,920
<i>Et tu,</i> Hodges?

00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:33,788
It's a bureaucracy.

00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,324
Just keeping it real.

00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:38,493
You want me to talk
to Conrad for you?

00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,494
Yeah, no.

00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:40,996
I can talk to him myself.

00:19:41,062 --> 00:19:42,497
You sure?

00:19:42,564 --> 00:19:43,765
We're in book club
together,

00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:45,901
and Conrad respects
my opinion.

00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:47,903
At least where
<i>Pride and Prejudice</i>

00:19:47,969 --> 00:19:48,937
and <i>Zombies</i>
is concerned.

00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:50,605
I thought you were
against me going

00:19:50,672 --> 00:19:53,775
from lab rat to field mouse?

00:19:53,842 --> 00:19:56,311
I just want you to be happy.

00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,123
ROBBINS:
Victim from the electronics
store was shot twice.

00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,426
Both bullets entered
front to back,

00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:12,928
but this one's
your killer.

00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:15,630
Did a little samba
around the lung and heart.

00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:16,631
(gunshot)

00:20:16,698 --> 00:20:18,433
<i>Bullet entered the left lung,</i>

00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,202
<i>hit the anterior aspect</i>

00:20:20,268 --> 00:20:23,805
<i>of the spine, then ricocheted</i>
<i>down into the ascending aorta.</i>

00:20:23,872 --> 00:20:25,473
.22s will do that.
Yeah.

00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,309
You find any soot
in his larynx?

00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:31,012
<i>Well, if you're wondering</i>
<i>whether Mr. Smith was breathing</i>

00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:35,050
<i>when the fire started, he was.</i>

00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:36,117
Thank you, Doctor.

00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:37,219
Show ain't over yet.

00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:41,656
Glasses?

00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:45,460
I found this under the soot.

00:20:45,527 --> 00:20:47,329
Bruise is perimortem.

00:20:47,395 --> 00:20:49,731
Could have occurred any
time between one minute

00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:51,733
and a couple hours
prior to death

00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,768
Judging from color and shape,

00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,570
I'd say someone slapped him
pretty hard.

00:20:55,637 --> 00:20:56,571
Maybe the killer.

00:20:56,638 --> 00:20:59,074
(claps twice)

00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,176
Or it could be
unrelated.

00:21:01,243 --> 00:21:02,944
The zipper on his pants
was down,

00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,381
so I swabbed his penis;
found a vaginal contribution.

00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:07,916
He had sex shortly
before death.

00:21:07,983 --> 00:21:10,485
So you're thinking it's a woman.
A little slap and tickle?

00:21:10,552 --> 00:21:13,221
Most men don't slap, they punch.

00:21:14,756 --> 00:21:15,657
<i>Now</i> the show's over.

00:21:15,724 --> 00:21:18,193
Not quite yet.

00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:22,531
SANDERS:
Uh, yeah, connect me
to pawnshop detail, please.

00:21:22,597 --> 00:21:25,066
Hi. This is CSI Sanders.
I need you

00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:27,035
to run some serial numbers
against your database.

00:21:27,102 --> 00:21:30,238
The first one is
a Patek Phillipe watch.

00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:34,943
Serial number is
Edward-6-Victor-5-Lincoln-2.

00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:39,481
All right, next one is
a diamond ring--

00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:44,052
5-Victor-7-2-1.

00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:46,855
Pam Harris.

00:21:46,922 --> 00:21:47,856
Grrlz Club?

00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:48,857
MAN:
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

00:21:48,924 --> 00:21:53,662
(rock music playing)

00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:12,280
♪ ♪

00:22:15,984 --> 00:22:17,486
I'm Pam.
You're looking for me?

00:22:17,552 --> 00:22:19,120
Miss Harris,
I'm Detective Vartann, LVPD

00:22:19,187 --> 00:22:21,389
This is Greg Sanders
from the crime lab.

00:22:21,456 --> 00:22:22,924
You reported
a ring missing?

00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:24,226
My engagement ring.

00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:25,460
If you guys got it,

00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:26,928
drinks are on me,
all night.

00:22:26,995 --> 00:22:29,164
We wish we could
take you up on that.

00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:30,432
So you caught the guy?

00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:33,101
Do you recognize this man?

00:22:33,168 --> 00:22:34,469
Wayne?

00:22:34,536 --> 00:22:35,937
Are you kidding me?

00:22:36,004 --> 00:22:39,074
Angela, get your
ass over here.

00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,809
These guys
want to know

00:22:40,876 --> 00:22:42,844
about Wayne.

00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:44,613
I told you not
to date customers.

00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:45,881
Wayne's my boyfriend.

00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,349
He's not in any trouble, is he?

00:22:47,415 --> 00:22:50,819
Did you know Wayne
was fencing stolen goods?

00:22:50,886 --> 00:22:52,954
No way. He sells TV's.

00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:55,223
But I lost my
sapphire necklace

00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,792
just last week, and Wayne
kept telling me it must be

00:22:57,859 --> 00:22:58,894
in my apartment.

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,496
That dirtbag!

00:23:01,563 --> 00:23:04,199
I'll tell you where he lives,
and I'll press charges.

00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:07,135
Well, that
won't be necessary.

00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,971
He's dead.

00:23:10,038 --> 00:23:11,706
Oh, my God.

00:23:15,944 --> 00:23:17,245
I ran this three times,

00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,514
and I kept getting
exactly the same results.

00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:22,918
I think I cross-contaminated
your samples.

00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,553
(clears throat):
All right...

00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:26,588
first of all,
what are your results?

00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,490
Well, the fluid from the alley

00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:31,293
came back as a mixture
of Tommy Baker's blood

00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:32,828
mixed with Wayne
Smith's semen.

00:23:32,894 --> 00:23:34,529
Wayne Smith?
That's <i>our</i> victim.

00:23:34,596 --> 00:23:35,730
Right. And
then the blood

00:23:35,797 --> 00:23:37,966
from the bag that you
two found at the store

00:23:38,033 --> 00:23:39,134
came back as
Tommy Baker.

00:23:39,201 --> 00:23:41,136
That's our victim
from the alley.

00:23:41,203 --> 00:23:43,405
Not a mixture,
just a single profile?

00:23:43,471 --> 00:23:46,641
Yeah. That's why
I confirmed it in triplicate.

00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:49,678
Okay, so if there was
cross-contamination

00:23:49,744 --> 00:23:52,113
or commingling,
there'd be a mixture

00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,382
of profiles
on the bag, too.

00:23:54,449 --> 00:23:57,252
Unless it's an additional
lab error, and it's from

00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:59,421
a third, unrelated case?

00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,790
Knowing Wendy's process
and lab procedure,

00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,459
with only one case
open at a time,

00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,128
I'd say that's... impossible.

00:24:08,463 --> 00:24:10,732
WILLOWS:
So if there's
no cross-contamination,

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,033
then there's a connection.

00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,502
It means
that Wayne Smith

00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,837
sexually assaulted Tommy Baker.

00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:18,640
(punches landing, grunting)

00:24:22,177 --> 00:24:25,213
Which gave Tommy motive
to kill the bastard.

00:24:26,648 --> 00:24:28,817
If I were Tommy,
I would've killed him, too.

00:24:34,122 --> 00:24:35,724
Hey, look.

00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:38,160
I found a Franken-Blob.

00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,328
That could be our missing

00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,797
surveillance tape.

00:24:41,863 --> 00:24:44,366
Mm, it's pretty destroyed.

00:24:44,432 --> 00:24:47,702
Archie's gonna have
a hard time with this one.

00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:51,339
Hmm.

00:24:53,508 --> 00:24:57,846
We didn't find any evidence
of accelerant at the scene,

00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:01,250
but these could be
our ignition source.

00:25:01,317 --> 00:25:02,752
Maybe you can
pull DNA.

00:25:02,818 --> 00:25:05,821
I knew you were taking
a lot of classes--
I didn't realize

00:25:05,888 --> 00:25:07,823
you knew all
about DNA.
No, I don't know

00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,159
all about it... yet.
(laughs)

00:25:10,226 --> 00:25:12,461
But I did learn
that burn materials

00:25:12,528 --> 00:25:14,730
used to be collected
in paint cans

00:25:14,797 --> 00:25:16,732
and plastic bags, which
preserves accelerant

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,434
but destroys DNA,

00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:21,103
which, until recently, no one
knew could survive fire damage.

00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,938
I take it you passed.

00:25:23,005 --> 00:25:25,408
You take it right.

00:25:25,474 --> 00:25:27,910
Mm, the stems are limp;
that means they got wet.

00:25:27,977 --> 00:25:30,813
Unfortunately, DNA can't survive
on burn material once it's wet.

00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:38,087
Well...

00:25:38,154 --> 00:25:39,855
Wendy,

00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:41,957
these babies look dry.

00:25:51,901 --> 00:25:53,135
Where have you been?

00:25:53,202 --> 00:25:54,437
I was dialoguing with Conrad.

00:25:54,503 --> 00:25:55,938
What else have
you been touching?

00:25:56,005 --> 00:25:58,374
Have you run the trace
from my cash tray?

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,282
Dust bunnies?

00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:07,883
Comprised of dirt,
pollen, metal shavings

00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,452
from copper wiring
and fecal matter.

00:26:09,518 --> 00:26:12,388
Did you know that most dust
contains trace amounts of poop?

00:26:12,455 --> 00:26:14,757
Even in hospitals.

00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:17,026
What about the white fragment?

00:26:17,093 --> 00:26:18,527
Eh, still in the works.

00:26:18,594 --> 00:26:20,596
All right, I know
you're dying to know,

00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:22,131
so I'm just gonna tell you.

00:26:22,198 --> 00:26:24,734
I was talking to Onrad-Cay
about Endy-Way

00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,270
and an ansfer-tray
to the ield-fay.

00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,373
I... need the trace.

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,376
Ow-nay.

00:26:35,111 --> 00:26:37,246
Oser-lay.

00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,284
Ey-hay.

00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,221
LANGSTON:
The edges of the security tape
were melted,

00:26:45,287 --> 00:26:46,689
but this section
survived.

00:26:46,756 --> 00:26:49,225
It's from the night
before Smith was shot.

00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:50,793
Check out the bag.

00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,329
Now, it looks like
the one that we found,

00:26:53,396 --> 00:26:55,498
but it doesn't have
Tommy's blood on it yet.

00:26:55,564 --> 00:26:57,133
I think this is Tommy.

00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:59,769
Seems to be avoiding
the camera.

00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:01,237
Does have on
similar clothing.

00:27:01,303 --> 00:27:03,839
The night that Greg and
I processed the store,

00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:07,343
we were under the assumption
that it was one event.

00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,477
Wayne interrupted
a burglary,

00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,646
the suspect shot him
and torched the place.

00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:13,182
But this proves there
were two events.

00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:15,851
<i>The botched burglary</i>
<i>on Thursday night...</i>

00:27:15,918 --> 00:27:17,053
WAYNE:
Bastard! I'm gonna kill you!

00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,721
...the shooting on
Friday morning.

00:27:18,788 --> 00:27:21,190
That time code
says 10:16 p.m.

00:27:21,257 --> 00:27:24,694
Wayne assaulted
Tommy in the alley
a few minutes later.

00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,496
You know...

00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:30,599
that electronics store
was only five blocks away.

00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:33,302
So... there was
a chain of events,

00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:35,571
assuming that Tommy
is our killer.

00:27:35,638 --> 00:27:36,639
Okay, let it run.

00:27:36,706 --> 00:27:37,740
All right.

00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:45,414
What did he just take there?

00:27:46,782 --> 00:27:48,017
There?

00:27:52,121 --> 00:27:53,389
That's a St. Christopher medal.

00:27:53,456 --> 00:27:55,758
You know, I found
one of those at
my crime scene.

00:27:55,825 --> 00:27:59,962
Then how did he
know it was there,
and why did he take it?

00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:01,731
(sighs)

00:28:01,797 --> 00:28:03,332
What is it, Nick?

00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:04,734
Wayne had a stripper girlfriend.

00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,603
He had sex with a female
just moments before he died.

00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,939
Every indication is,
this guy was a hetero.

00:28:10,006 --> 00:28:12,074
So?
So, you catch a guy

00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:14,310
burgling your store,
you want to teach him a lesson--

00:28:14,377 --> 00:28:17,046
I get it, you beat him,
you stab him, you shoot him--

00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:18,614
but do you have to rape him?

00:28:18,681 --> 00:28:22,451
Greek warriors in ancient times
would sodomize their enemies

00:28:22,518 --> 00:28:26,222
after a battle to humiliate
them, take their manhood.

00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:28,491
Yeah, yeah, I understand
the concept of humiliation--

00:28:28,557 --> 00:28:30,459
rape isn't about sex,
it's about violence.

00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:33,062
But this is a little excessive,
don't you think?

00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:35,498
Well...

00:28:35,564 --> 00:28:38,100
for some men...

00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:40,770
violence is their sex.

00:28:40,836 --> 00:28:43,072
BRASS:
Do you recognize that man?

00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:44,907
WILLOWS:
He was in the store
Thursday night.

00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:47,209
We have him
on surveillance.

00:28:47,276 --> 00:28:49,712
No. I've never
seen him before.

00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:51,681
We think he's the one
who killed your brother.

00:28:54,283 --> 00:28:56,285
No, he didn't.

00:28:57,753 --> 00:28:59,722
How do you know that?

00:29:04,093 --> 00:29:06,529
Because I killed Wayne.

00:29:12,735 --> 00:29:14,670
JESS:
<i>I hated him.</i>

00:29:14,737 --> 00:29:18,007
Wayne treated me like property.

00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,711
<i>Had all these rules.</i>

00:29:21,777 --> 00:29:23,713
<i>I couldn't wear short skirts.</i>

00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:26,882
<i>I had a 10:00 curfew.</i>

00:29:26,949 --> 00:29:29,218
<i>He would hack into my email.</i>

00:29:29,285 --> 00:29:32,054
<i>I couldn't sleep over</i>
<i>at friends or...</i>

00:29:32,121 --> 00:29:35,024
<i>or get my own car.</i>

00:29:35,091 --> 00:29:37,460
He threatened any guy
who asked me out.

00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,295
And that's why
you shot him?

00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:41,864
No.

00:29:41,931 --> 00:29:45,835
I shot him because he liked
to hit me when he got mad.

00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:50,373
Why don't you
tell me about that?

00:29:51,841 --> 00:29:54,810
The first time he hit me
was eighth grade,

00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:58,481
because I wore makeup to school.

00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:03,419
Wayne said I looked like
a whore, and he would know.

00:30:03,486 --> 00:30:07,590
He was such a hypocrite.

00:30:07,657 --> 00:30:10,359
Sleeping around, partying,
stealing stuff.

00:30:10,426 --> 00:30:13,996
BRASS:
<i>I'm just trying to understand.</i>

00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:18,734
<i>Did Wayne, uh,</i>
<i>do anything else to you?</i>

00:30:18,801 --> 00:30:22,238
JESS:
<i>Isn't that enough?</i>

00:30:22,304 --> 00:30:23,572
So no one ever noticed?

00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:26,776
You know, a doctor, a teacher,
a friend or anyone?

00:30:26,842 --> 00:30:29,111
I got real good
at hiding it.

00:30:30,946 --> 00:30:33,616
This is the last thing
he gave me.

00:30:35,318 --> 00:30:37,553
I tried to run away.

00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,355
He always found me.

00:30:39,422 --> 00:30:41,290
'He thought I was
his baby sister,

00:30:41,357 --> 00:30:43,592
and he wanted
to keep it that way.

00:30:48,197 --> 00:30:50,199
<i>I'm 18 years old.</i>

00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:53,936
He was never going to let me
have my own life.

00:31:00,843 --> 00:31:01,944
(beep)

00:31:02,011 --> 00:31:06,182
Oh. Now, that looks
like you know him.

00:31:06,248 --> 00:31:08,718
You know, I think
I get it now.

00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:09,986
Your brother, Wayne Smith,

00:31:10,052 --> 00:31:11,587
caught your boyfriend,
Tommy Baker,

00:31:11,654 --> 00:31:13,889
stealing from his store
and assaulted him.

00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:16,492
And then Tommy came back
later and shot Wayne.

00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,961
And then in order to
cover up for Tommy,

00:31:19,028 --> 00:31:20,930
you made up
this whole...

00:31:20,997 --> 00:31:23,566
sequence of lies.

00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,267
No.

00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:31,307
We were going to get married.

00:31:31,374 --> 00:31:34,110
We needed money
to get out of town.

00:31:34,176 --> 00:31:36,445
So I came up
with this plan

00:31:36,512 --> 00:31:38,914
to rob the store.

00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:42,018
But I left my
St. Christopher medal, and...

00:31:42,084 --> 00:31:44,086
I couldn't leave without it.

00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:47,356
It was my mom's.

00:31:47,423 --> 00:31:50,026
That's how Tommy ended up
on the surveillance.

00:31:50,092 --> 00:31:51,627
That's the least
of his problems.

00:31:51,694 --> 00:31:52,962
I already told you.

00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,733
I shot my brother.

00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,302
Tommy had nothing to do with it.

00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:04,674
OFFICER:
Don't run!

00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,442
Tommy, stop!

00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:08,544
On the ground!
Hold it right there!

00:32:08,611 --> 00:32:10,846
(cops shouting, Tommy yelling)

00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:16,352
What is this?

00:32:16,418 --> 00:32:17,586
It's the number of someone

00:32:17,653 --> 00:32:19,321
who might be able
to help you.

00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:24,360
Listen, Tom, I know
what happened to you
in that alley.

00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:26,161
What are you talking about?
Hey, rape

00:32:26,228 --> 00:32:28,230
is a horrible thing,
no matter who it happens to.

00:32:28,297 --> 00:32:29,465
This young lady will...

00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,700
will better understand
what it is you might

00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:33,802
be going through, help
keep your manhood intact.

00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,270
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:36,572
Nothing happened.

00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:38,340
Look, W-Wayne beat me up.

00:32:38,407 --> 00:32:40,642
Okay? He didn't
make me some...

00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,244
some bitch.
We talked
to your girlfriend,

00:32:42,311 --> 00:32:44,847
Jess-- she claims she's
the one that did it.

00:32:44,913 --> 00:32:47,383
Did... did what?

00:32:48,751 --> 00:32:50,552
Shot Wayne.

00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:56,191
I did it.

00:32:56,258 --> 00:32:57,826
I killed Wayne.

00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,596
Everything was
my idea.

00:33:00,663 --> 00:33:03,499
Well, we found her prints on the
unlocked window at the scene.

00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,401
That's conspiracy.

00:33:05,467 --> 00:33:06,802
I'm telling you right now,

00:33:06,869 --> 00:33:08,971
Jess had nothing to do
with that, okay?

00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:10,973
I staked that place out
for three weeks.

00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,275
And after the robbery
went south,

00:33:13,342 --> 00:33:15,844
after the alley, I went
back into the store.

00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,212
<i>And I knew right then that</i>

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,515
<i>he would never let me</i>
<i>see Jess again.</i>

00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:20,816
Son of a bitch!

00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,795
I want to cooperate
with you, Mr. Stokes,

00:33:32,861 --> 00:33:36,699
100%, but you got to leave
Jess out of this.

00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,267
I can't do that, Tom.

00:33:38,334 --> 00:33:42,071
Not if the evidence
shows me she was involved.

00:33:43,472 --> 00:33:46,442
So what, you got him here?

00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:48,210
Mr. Stokes.
Yeah?

00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:49,678
Hey, I just got a call.

00:33:49,745 --> 00:33:50,980
Tommy's been arrested?

00:33:51,046 --> 00:33:52,481
(phone ringing)
I don't understand.

00:33:52,548 --> 00:33:54,216
You brother just confessed
to killing the man

00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:55,551
who assaulted him.

00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,086
What?

00:33:57,152 --> 00:33:58,821
I'm sorry, Mark,
I got to take this.

00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:04,827
Tommy's lying.

00:34:04,893 --> 00:34:06,495
I shot Wayne Smith.

00:34:06,562 --> 00:34:08,630
Come again?

00:34:08,697 --> 00:34:10,632
Then I torched the store
to cover it up.

00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:15,371
This is for my brother.

00:34:17,406 --> 00:34:19,441
BRASS:
So you shot him
with a Colt .45?

00:34:19,508 --> 00:34:20,676
That's right.

00:34:20,743 --> 00:34:22,845
What did you do
with the revolver?

00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:26,248
I tossed it in a Dumpster
by my house.

00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:29,318
And you did this because
Wayne Smith assaulted
your brother--

00:34:29,385 --> 00:34:30,986
Tommy Baker?

00:34:31,053 --> 00:34:32,788
It was more than assault.

00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,258
He raped my brother.

00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:37,993
Tommy tell you that?

00:34:39,028 --> 00:34:42,364
I, uh...

00:34:42,431 --> 00:34:44,700
I figured it out.

00:34:48,137 --> 00:34:50,773
<i>When I saw the blood,</i>

00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,375
<i>I don't know, I felt sick.</i>

00:34:55,411 --> 00:34:57,780
What did he do to you, Tommy?

00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,682
You know, you could have just
called the police

00:34:59,748 --> 00:35:00,749
and had Wayne arrested.

00:35:00,816 --> 00:35:01,850
That would have been

00:35:01,917 --> 00:35:04,019
the easy
thing to do.

00:35:04,086 --> 00:35:06,188
Then the whole world
would know what happened.

00:35:08,624 --> 00:35:12,094
Tommy would have never been able
to live that down.

00:35:13,962 --> 00:35:17,766
The truth is,
it would have been better off

00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:20,002
if that bastard had just
killed Tommy.

00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:24,273
So we've got three confessions
and three suspects.

00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:28,210
Jess Smith, Tommy Baker,
Mark Baker.

00:35:28,277 --> 00:35:32,181
The DNA evidence
on the matchbook

00:35:32,247 --> 00:35:34,350
puts Mark at the scene.

00:35:34,416 --> 00:35:37,152
Which proves
that he set the fire.

00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:38,420
But he claims
he used a .45.

00:35:38,487 --> 00:35:39,822
Murder weapon
was a .22.

00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:42,024
Yeah, he's lying about that,
but not about the fire.

00:35:42,091 --> 00:35:43,726
STOKES:
<i>Yeah, he knew Tommy ran</i>
<i>out of the house</i>

00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:46,428
<i>and he assumed</i>
<i>his brother did it.</i>

00:35:46,495 --> 00:35:49,164
<i>He was trying to cover it up</i>
<i>to protect him.</i>

00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:52,935
<i>Grabbed the surveillance tape,</i>
<i>tossed it in the box,</i>

00:35:53,002 --> 00:35:54,236
<i>set the fire.</i>

00:35:56,171 --> 00:35:58,307
What do we have on Tommy?

00:35:58,374 --> 00:35:59,508
STOKES:
Motive, opportunity,

00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:01,310
but no physical evidence
putting him in the store

00:36:01,377 --> 00:36:02,611
at the time of the shooting.

00:36:02,678 --> 00:36:05,748
Have we considered
the possibility

00:36:05,814 --> 00:36:08,684
that Tommy confessed
for the same reason
his brother Mark did?

00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:10,953
To protect the person he loved.

00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:15,190
Jess-- who has her own reasons
for killing Wayne.

00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:17,192
Could have been Tommy,
could have been Jess,

00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:18,327
could have been both.

00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:23,298
Okay, maybe we can
come at this from a
different direction.

00:36:23,365 --> 00:36:25,167
Whoever shot Wayne,

00:36:25,234 --> 00:36:28,103
most likely stole the cash
from the register.

00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,772
Well, I didn't find any cash
in Jess' house.

00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:31,974
And I searched the Baker boys'
apartment and their vehicles.

00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:33,809
<i>Nada.</i>

00:36:33,876 --> 00:36:35,644
Then again, the mother could
have helped herself to it.

00:36:35,711 --> 00:36:39,948
WOMAN (over P.A.):
CSI Stokes. Stokes,
please come to reception.

00:36:40,015 --> 00:36:41,583
Now what?

00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,986
Ms. Martin.

00:36:44,053 --> 00:36:45,554
What can I do for you.

00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:46,855
I just came
from Tommy's jail cell.

00:36:46,922 --> 00:36:47,890
I didn't know
Victim's Services

00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,391
was allowed to talk
to suspects.

00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:50,926
He's still a victim.

00:36:50,993 --> 00:36:52,594
You're the one who gave him
my card.

00:36:52,661 --> 00:36:54,763
Tommy asked me to pass on a
message to his brother Mark.

00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:57,232
Who is also now in jail.
What's the message?

00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:59,335
You know I'm bound
by confidentiality.

00:36:59,401 --> 00:37:02,338
Come on. Why'd you
come down here then?

00:37:02,404 --> 00:37:05,541
I've read Tommy's confession,
and the police report.

00:37:05,607 --> 00:37:08,877
There is no way that kid
was brave enough to confront
his attacker unarmed.

00:37:08,944 --> 00:37:10,612
It's very atypical.

00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:12,581
Like everything
in this case.

00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:14,950
Look, I know you think
I'm just a bleeding heart,

00:37:15,017 --> 00:37:17,152
but I can read victims
like you can read fingerprints.

00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:19,521
Tommy Baker is not a killer.

00:37:21,423 --> 00:37:23,425
Okay.

00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:25,527
Okay, I'll keep that
under consideration.

00:37:27,363 --> 00:37:29,365
I don't think you're
a bleeding heart.

00:37:30,899 --> 00:37:34,069
I appreciate the help.

00:37:39,441 --> 00:37:41,543
Your white fragment.

00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,879
Ran MICRO-FTIR.

00:37:43,946 --> 00:37:45,047
Came back synthetic.

00:37:45,114 --> 00:37:46,649
More specifically acrylic.

00:37:46,715 --> 00:37:49,852
With a layer of "Snow White"
nail polish on top.

00:37:52,087 --> 00:37:54,723
French tips.

00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:57,626
My mother wears acrylics...

00:37:57,693 --> 00:37:59,962
♪ ♪

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,734
Hey, Ms. Paulson.

00:38:05,801 --> 00:38:06,869
Hey, officers.

00:38:06,935 --> 00:38:09,705
Did you find my necklace?

00:38:09,772 --> 00:38:11,206
No, but we think
we found out

00:38:11,273 --> 00:38:12,408
who killed your
boyfriend Wayne.

00:38:12,474 --> 00:38:15,210
Really? Who was it?

00:38:15,277 --> 00:38:16,278
You.

00:38:18,447 --> 00:38:20,649
This is a search warrant.

00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:23,018
I'll take that,
thank you.

00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:34,663
Same serial number
as the bait money.

00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:37,366
Stop!
Why don't you tell me
that you love it, huh?

00:38:37,433 --> 00:38:38,901
Don't! I don't want to!

00:38:38,967 --> 00:38:40,736
I got to get to work.

00:38:40,803 --> 00:38:43,005
What? I'm not man
enough for you?
Just give me my money.

00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:45,674
I want my cut for all
the stuff I stole.

00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:47,176
That's for the dress
I bought you.

00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:49,178
You owe me for the trip.

00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:50,346
That was a gift you ass!

00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:51,714
(gun cocking)

00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:55,084
Get that thing out of my face!
(gunshot)

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,260
You're under arrest
for the murder of Wayne Smith.

00:39:05,327 --> 00:39:06,428
It wasn't my fault.

00:39:06,495 --> 00:39:08,597
I wiped off the gun
and took what he owed me.

00:39:08,664 --> 00:39:10,232
It was self-defense.
Keep still, ma'am, please.

00:39:10,299 --> 00:39:11,934
Thank you.

00:39:12,968 --> 00:39:14,903
WILLOWS:
<i>You're free to go.</i>

00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,505
They're just finishing
up some paperwork.

00:39:16,572 --> 00:39:18,974
But I need
to ask you...

00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:22,211
How did Wayne know that Tommy
would be at the store?

00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:23,679
He didn't.

00:39:26,515 --> 00:39:28,684
Wayne was supposed
to be at home with me.

00:39:30,653 --> 00:39:32,988
This whole thing
was my fault.

00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,492
My brother was
obsessed with me

00:39:36,558 --> 00:39:39,194
staying a virgin.

00:39:39,261 --> 00:39:41,597
He had no clue Tommy
and I were having sex.

00:39:41,664 --> 00:39:44,433
<i>Tommy would always come over</i>
<i>when Wayne was at work.</i>

00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,434
No, wait, no.

00:39:45,501 --> 00:39:46,835
Oh, I ripped your shirt.

00:39:46,902 --> 00:39:49,104
I'm sorry.

00:39:49,171 --> 00:39:51,707
(both laughing)

00:39:53,342 --> 00:39:55,344
I didn't even
think about it

00:39:55,411 --> 00:39:58,247
when my shirt ripped that night.

00:39:58,314 --> 00:40:00,616
Then Wayne came home...

00:40:04,386 --> 00:40:06,188
What the hell
happened to you?
Nothing.

00:40:06,255 --> 00:40:09,291
It must have ripped
on something.

00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:10,826
I'm-I'm fine.

00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:14,530
You had sex, didn't you?!

00:40:14,596 --> 00:40:15,531
No.

00:40:15,597 --> 00:40:16,699
No, Wayne, no.

00:40:16,765 --> 00:40:18,067
I wouldn't.

00:40:23,138 --> 00:40:26,141
It wasn't like that.
It wasn't.

00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:28,444
It was that Baker kid,
wasn't it? Huh?

00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,045
He forced you, didn't he?

00:40:30,112 --> 00:40:32,114
Didn't he?

00:40:32,181 --> 00:40:34,083
JESS:
<i>He went crazy.</i>

00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:38,020
<i>Took my cell and locked</i>
<i>me in my room.</i>

00:40:38,087 --> 00:40:41,924
I knew Tommy was at the store
and Wayne was going there

00:40:41,991 --> 00:40:46,729
to get his gun, but...
I had no way to warn him.

00:40:48,731 --> 00:40:50,532
So what's going to happen
to my brother?

00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:53,535
D.A.'s gonna charge
him with manslaughter.

00:40:53,602 --> 00:40:57,306
Wayne was still alive
when Mark set that fire.

00:40:57,373 --> 00:41:00,576
Listen, Tommy,

00:41:00,642 --> 00:41:02,878
I know you've been traumatized.

00:41:02,945 --> 00:41:05,881
And I want to tell
you that, uh...

00:41:07,716 --> 00:41:09,084
Hey, look at me.

00:41:09,151 --> 00:41:10,319
(sniffs)

00:41:10,386 --> 00:41:11,654
If there's
anything you need,

00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,389
you call me.

00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:17,760
Here, take this.

00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,735
Back-back in the alley

00:41:26,802 --> 00:41:29,338
uh...

00:41:29,405 --> 00:41:30,806
he said something.

00:41:33,175 --> 00:41:36,578
I'm going to ruin you 
like you ruined my sister!

00:41:36,645 --> 00:41:38,447
It really worked.

00:41:38,514 --> 00:41:40,949
Because I can't even think

00:41:41,016 --> 00:41:44,320
about Jess now,
without seeing his face.

00:41:46,155 --> 00:41:49,925
I didn't even fight back.

00:41:49,992 --> 00:41:51,627
I just froze up, you know.

00:41:51,694 --> 00:41:54,096
I didn't-- Why couldn't I
at least just fight back?

00:41:54,163 --> 00:41:56,498
It wasn't your fault.

00:41:59,702 --> 00:42:01,203
Look, Jess doesn't know
what happened,

00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,072
and I'm sure not going
to say anything.

00:42:03,138 --> 00:42:06,275
And if you
don't want to,

00:42:06,342 --> 00:42:08,210
that's up to you.

00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:11,246
But if you really love her
and she really loves you,

00:42:11,313 --> 00:42:13,482
this isn't going
to make a difference.

00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,889
Tommy?

00:42:57,059 --> 00:42:59,762
Tommy...

00:43:03,532 --> 00:43:05,000
Tommy?
