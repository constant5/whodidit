00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,664
You guys, ready?

00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,732
(women laughing)

00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,322
(man laughing)

00:00:37,388 --> 00:00:38,823
Yes!

00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,892
(coins clattering)

00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:46,264
(indistinct chattering)

00:00:51,102 --> 00:00:52,303
Seven.
Yes!

00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,305
(cheering)

00:00:54,372 --> 00:00:55,840
Yes. Yes.

00:00:55,907 --> 00:00:57,642
Pay it. Pay it.

00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:13,291
(laughter)

00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:29,507
I already ejected the guest
from the show.

00:01:29,574 --> 00:01:30,975
You don't need to do anything.

00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,311
Just send him down.

00:01:33,378 --> 00:01:35,747
Tell him to meet me
at the front desk.

00:01:41,552 --> 00:01:43,554
(elevator bell dings)

00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:46,624
MAN:
What's your floor, honey?

00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:47,725
WILLOWS:
17.

00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:51,462
Who gets thrown out
of a lingerie show

00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:53,531
in Vegas?

00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,435
I mean, what is the point
of having live girls

00:01:57,502 --> 00:01:59,504
if you can't touch them?

00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,572
I flew all the
way from Omaha.

00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,224
Hi.

00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,225
Hey.

00:02:26,164 --> 00:02:27,598
(laughs)

00:02:27,665 --> 00:02:29,067
MAN:
Well, everybody's

00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:31,469
getting lucky tonight.

00:02:31,536 --> 00:02:33,037
(door closes)

00:02:33,104 --> 00:02:35,039
Sorry, close call.

00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:37,809
Too close.

00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,210
Where's the setup?

00:02:39,277 --> 00:02:40,845
It's in here.

00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:42,146
Our first suspect,
Everett Edwards,

00:02:42,213 --> 00:02:44,515
decided to bring the
party back to the room.

00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:46,684
Had to get our guys
out of there fast.

00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:49,287
I passed Greg
and Archie in the hall.

00:02:49,354 --> 00:02:51,389
They got out of
there just in time.

00:02:51,456 --> 00:02:54,125
But they didn't finish.

00:02:54,192 --> 00:02:55,660
WOMAN:
Ooh. Hi.

00:02:55,727 --> 00:02:57,495
(door opening)
Wow, look at this place.

00:02:57,562 --> 00:03:00,565
Oh. No bathroom cam.

00:03:00,631 --> 00:03:03,267
Here's the second suspect,
Bellermine Quisk.

00:03:03,334 --> 00:03:04,736
Goes by Bell.

00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:06,971
These two guys are the
biggest suppliers of Ecstasy

00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:09,507
in the Southwest.

00:03:09,574 --> 00:03:10,808
When did they get here?

00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,377
Everett checked in
around 2:00.

00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:13,678
Bell, about an hour ago.

00:03:13,745 --> 00:03:16,781
Since then, it's been
all booze and hookers.

00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:20,985
Well, there's no chemicals
or apparatus visible.

00:03:21,052 --> 00:03:22,153
(woman laughing)

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,855
Probably still
in the luggage.

00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:25,156
(phone ringing)

00:03:25,223 --> 00:03:26,758
Hey, Greg.

00:03:26,824 --> 00:03:28,960
SANDERS:
Bathroom cam malfunctioned.

00:03:29,027 --> 00:03:31,562
Tell her we can get
a lipstick cam in
the tissue box.

00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:33,498
Just need a
little time.
Did you hear that?

00:03:33,564 --> 00:03:34,666
Yeah.

00:03:34,732 --> 00:03:36,267
But I think the boys
are in for the night.

00:03:36,334 --> 00:03:37,435
SANDERS:
Okay.

00:03:37,502 --> 00:03:39,303
I'll send Archie back
to the lab.

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,572
I'm gonna stick around
in case you need me.

00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,974
Thanks.

00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:46,110
So you get to kick it with
the babes in the casino,

00:03:46,177 --> 00:03:48,546
and I get Hodges
at the lab.

00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:50,248
Yup.

00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,550
Sorry.

00:03:57,855 --> 00:04:00,525
(phone beeps)

00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:02,560
(beeps)

00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:15,506
(cries out)

00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:17,642
(grunts)

00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:20,478
(groaning)

00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,452
Oh! Oh.

00:04:31,489 --> 00:04:32,924
Oh.

00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:34,659
Oh.

00:04:34,726 --> 00:04:38,162
Catherine, I think
I got a dead body here.

00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:41,399
Uh, there's a-a woman down.

00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:42,900
Archie, where exactly are you?

00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:44,369
The loading dock.

00:04:44,435 --> 00:04:46,270
Her head's bleeding. Uh...

00:04:46,337 --> 00:04:48,106
WILLOWS:
Okay, listen to me.
This is what you're going to do.

00:04:48,172 --> 00:04:50,708
Stay with the body, don't
let anybody come or go,

00:04:50,775 --> 00:04:52,043
and don't touch anything.

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,478
Got it.

00:04:56,414 --> 00:04:58,449
I don't believe this.

00:04:58,516 --> 00:05:01,285
We got a 419
down at the loading dock.

00:05:01,352 --> 00:05:04,022
Well... we can't have
a big police presence here.

00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:05,523
I'll call it in.

00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,127
The last thing we need tonight
is a crime scene.

00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,137
♪ Who... are you? ♪

00:05:19,203 --> 00:05:21,906
♪ Who, who, who, who? ♪

00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:24,909
♪ Who... are you? ♪

00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:27,145
♪ Who, who, who, who? ♪

00:05:27,211 --> 00:05:28,813

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,482

00:05:31,549 --> 00:05:33,117
♪ Oh-oh-oh ♪

00:05:33,184 --> 00:05:36,754

00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:39,891

00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:43,278
MAN:
Her name was Sasha Katsaros.

00:05:43,345 --> 00:05:44,780
She was one
of our event planners.

00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:46,148
Outstanding employee.

00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:47,482
You know, everybody loved her.

00:05:47,549 --> 00:05:49,318
She'd always go
that extra mile.

00:05:49,384 --> 00:05:50,819
What kind of
security do you have

00:05:50,886 --> 00:05:53,222
in the, uh, employee
areas, Mr. Thomas?

00:05:53,288 --> 00:05:55,090
Call me Finn, please.
Sure.

00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:57,192
Well, no cameras, but,
uh, access is restricted

00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:59,494
to employees,
key card only.

00:05:59,561 --> 00:06:02,130
We're gonna need a list
of all the employees who were

00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:04,132
on duty
tonight.
Absolutely.

00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,134
Did you see
or speak to Miss Katsaros

00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:07,469
at any point today?

00:06:07,536 --> 00:06:11,874
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, the last time
I saw her was at... 10:00 p.m.

00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,809
All right, Finn,
can you tell me, uh,

00:06:13,876 --> 00:06:15,711
who she was going
that extra mile for?

00:06:15,777 --> 00:06:17,779
Yes.

00:06:19,915 --> 00:06:21,116
FINN:
His name is Lon Rose.

00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,318
He's hosting a private
lingerie show in the casino.

00:06:23,385 --> 00:06:26,188
And I should mention
that Sasha sometimes brought

00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:27,689
angry guests back here
to calm them down.

00:06:27,756 --> 00:06:29,424
Thanks.

00:06:29,491 --> 00:06:31,226
I want everyone
behind the crime tape

00:06:31,293 --> 00:06:33,095
until we finish
processing the scene.

00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:34,730
Anything you need,
you know where to find me.

00:06:34,796 --> 00:06:36,565
Thank you.

00:06:36,632 --> 00:06:39,034
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:06:43,138 --> 00:06:45,340
STOKES:
Dried blood on the stairs.

00:06:45,407 --> 00:06:47,009
It looks like she took a tumble.

00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:49,878
Archie said her body
was still warm?

00:06:49,945 --> 00:06:54,049
LANGSTON: Head of security
said he saw her at 10:00 p.m.

00:06:54,116 --> 00:06:57,119
Archie called
Catherine at 11:15.

00:06:57,185 --> 00:06:59,788
That gives us a 75-minute
window for time of death.

00:06:59,855 --> 00:07:01,156
PHILLIPS:
Hey.

00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:06,795
He's looking
kind of green.
SANDERS:
How you doing, man?

00:07:06,862 --> 00:07:09,298
First DB's the hardest.

00:07:09,364 --> 00:07:10,799
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:12,200
PHILLIPS:
Huh.

00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:13,602
Neck feels broken.

00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:17,773
She's got a four plus one

00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,241
on the left forearm.

00:07:19,308 --> 00:07:22,611
STOKES: Yeah, same thing
on the other arm.

00:07:22,678 --> 00:07:25,113
Thumbs on the inside,
fingers on the outside.

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,381
Stop!

00:07:26,448 --> 00:07:28,750
<i>Whoever grabbed her</i>
<i>was facing her.</i>

00:07:28,817 --> 00:07:32,788
Hey. I, uh, told Archie
to go to the lab

00:07:32,854 --> 00:07:34,056
and check in his clothes

00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:36,124
and then head to the station
and give his statement.

00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,994
He's, uh, a little
shook up, but

00:07:39,061 --> 00:07:40,229
he'll be okay.

00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:42,231
He did have one

00:07:42,297 --> 00:07:44,233
unusual observation.

00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:45,400
David,

00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:47,803
can you please confirm
if the vic

00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,839
has, uh... gone commando?

00:07:50,906 --> 00:07:52,841
Sure.

00:07:52,908 --> 00:07:54,910
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:07:56,812 --> 00:07:59,414
No underwear.

00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:01,650
Why was he looking

00:08:01,717 --> 00:08:03,619
up her skirt to begin with?

00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:05,621
He was just being thorough.

00:08:05,687 --> 00:08:07,256
LANGSTON:
The killer might have taken

00:08:07,322 --> 00:08:10,425
the panties as a souvenir,

00:08:10,492 --> 00:08:12,494
which means
this wasn't an accident.

00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:13,962
Okay.

00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:16,665
Be sure and collect
an SAE kit, huh, Super?

00:08:20,602 --> 00:08:23,305
I know. Just make sure
that no one enters the casino

00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:24,706
with vests, radios or uniforms.

00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:26,041
We can't have any mistakes.

00:08:26,108 --> 00:08:27,876
STOKES: Copy that.
How's the stakeout going?

00:08:27,943 --> 00:08:29,678
Well, so far,
it's like watching bad porn.

00:08:29,745 --> 00:08:31,079
All right, talk to you later.

00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:33,315
Keep me in the loop, Nicky.
Will do.

00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:37,819
I just don't get
these two idiots.

00:08:37,886 --> 00:08:39,688
They're born
into money.

00:08:39,755 --> 00:08:41,123
They graduated
good schools.

00:08:41,189 --> 00:08:43,058
Their daddies
paid for it all.

00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,893
Sounds like you've got an issue
with rich people.

00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,061
No.

00:08:46,128 --> 00:08:48,330
I got an issue with
rich kids killing

00:08:48,397 --> 00:08:49,531
poor kids.

00:08:49,598 --> 00:08:50,999
These guys were
in Tahoe last week.

00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:53,902
They were peddling bunny tabs
laced with DXM.

00:08:53,969 --> 00:08:55,037
Cough suppressant.

00:08:55,103 --> 00:08:57,272
Causes hallucinations,
inhibits sweating,

00:08:57,339 --> 00:08:58,507
raises body temperature.

00:08:58,574 --> 00:09:00,709
You add E and a hot dance party,
you got yourself

00:09:00,776 --> 00:09:02,411
a heart attack before
you're old enough to vote.

00:09:02,477 --> 00:09:03,712
And with their
background,

00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,048
they probably didn't cut the E
to save money.

00:09:06,114 --> 00:09:07,549
Trying to

00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:09,885
distinguish their product,
make it a stronger trip.

00:09:09,952 --> 00:09:12,054
And Bell, his profile
is even more disturbing.

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,056
This kid,
he gets off on anything taboo.

00:09:14,122 --> 00:09:16,124
He is a crazy bastard.

00:09:16,191 --> 00:09:19,528
And what makes you guys think
they cook in hotels?

00:09:19,595 --> 00:09:21,396
Tahoe PD found
an empty can of ether

00:09:21,463 --> 00:09:23,265
and some broken glassware
in their hotel room,

00:09:23,332 --> 00:09:24,866
but that's not enough
to bust them.

00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:26,835
So we got to catch
them in the act?

00:09:26,902 --> 00:09:29,538
Just... not that act.

00:09:31,907 --> 00:09:34,810
(moaning on video)

00:09:36,578 --> 00:09:38,347
Nothing on surveillance.

00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:40,515
Did you find anything
in the vic's files?

00:09:40,582 --> 00:09:42,551
Yes. She noted an incident
with an angry guest

00:09:42,618 --> 00:09:45,721
at the lingerie show,
but no details.

00:09:45,787 --> 00:09:47,289
STOKES:
Well, it's a private show.

00:09:47,356 --> 00:09:49,057
There has to be a guest list.

00:09:49,124 --> 00:09:51,460
Let's get a name.

00:09:55,731 --> 00:09:58,500
(Stokes signs)

00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:00,569
How do you want
to do this?

00:10:02,938 --> 00:10:04,172
Nick!
Hmm?

00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:06,208
How do you want
to do this?

00:10:06,275 --> 00:10:07,476
Oh, yeah.

00:10:07,543 --> 00:10:10,045
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Cheerleaders are my weakness.

00:10:10,112 --> 00:10:11,547
I noticed.

00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:13,949
Let's find the host
of this shindig.

00:10:14,016 --> 00:10:15,817
Divide and conquer.

00:10:15,884 --> 00:10:17,886
Yeah.

00:10:19,888 --> 00:10:21,890
(sighs):
Oh.

00:10:50,986 --> 00:10:52,921
Excuse me, ma'am.

00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:54,957
Hi.

00:10:55,991 --> 00:10:58,293
Hi.

00:10:59,628 --> 00:11:03,065
Do you know where I could find
a guy named Lon Rose?

00:11:04,099 --> 00:11:05,968
It's Brenda.

00:11:06,034 --> 00:11:07,603
Brenda?
Mm-hmm.

00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:08,837
Okay.

00:11:11,807 --> 00:11:14,109
I haven't seen him in a while.

00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:15,711
No?
Mm-mm.

00:11:15,777 --> 00:11:17,279
Okay.

00:11:17,346 --> 00:11:20,148
What do you think about these?

00:11:23,418 --> 00:11:25,087
I slept in them all night.

00:11:27,055 --> 00:11:30,025
I don't know what to think,
to be honest with you.

00:11:32,928 --> 00:11:34,529
I'll take them.

00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,693
♪ ♪

00:12:19,942 --> 00:12:22,444
You looking for
sweet or sour?

00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:25,881
Sweet or sour?

00:12:25,948 --> 00:12:27,115
(chuckles)

00:12:27,182 --> 00:12:29,751
Well, you must be a musk man.

00:12:29,818 --> 00:12:32,354
Have I got the perfect
model for you.

00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:35,424
You must be Lon Rose.
Yes.

00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,227
Hi.

00:12:38,293 --> 00:12:40,862
I haven't seen you before.

00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:42,531
You find us online?

00:12:42,598 --> 00:12:44,099
No, my name's Langston.

00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,634
Langston.

00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:47,903
Ray Langston.

00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,906
I'm with
the Vegas Crime Lab.

00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:52,407
I need to speak with you,
Mr. Rose,

00:12:52,474 --> 00:12:55,978
about, uh,
a woman named Sasha Katsaros.

00:12:56,044 --> 00:12:57,145
You gotta be kidding me.

00:12:57,212 --> 00:12:58,280
Pudder called you guys?

00:12:58,347 --> 00:13:01,850
Ms. Katsaros was
only doing her job.

00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:04,152
Mr. Pudder was out of line.

00:13:04,219 --> 00:13:06,255
And who is Mr. Pudder?

00:13:06,321 --> 00:13:08,223
A buyer.

00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,760
See, he started
pawing one of the models

00:13:11,827 --> 00:13:14,529
and when he wouldn't stop,
I asked Sasha to eject him.

00:13:14,596 --> 00:13:17,232
He tried to sneak
back in, I sent him

00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:18,934
downstairs to her and
she took care of it.

00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:20,502
Hey. Hey.

00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:22,271
You open it,
you own it, pal.

00:13:22,337 --> 00:13:23,906
Yeah, I see you.

00:13:23,972 --> 00:13:26,975
Uh, I'm happy
to talk to you all night.

00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:29,144
Just, uh, let me
take care of business.

00:13:29,211 --> 00:13:31,446
Very well.
Okay.

00:13:33,115 --> 00:13:35,918
Hey, check it out.

00:13:35,984 --> 00:13:37,486
Two grand
for a pair of underwear.

00:13:37,553 --> 00:13:38,787
Can you believe that?

00:13:38,854 --> 00:13:43,659
Why would you want
to vacuum pack panties?

00:13:43,725 --> 00:13:46,995
Well, the vacuum process
removes oxygen, which

00:13:47,062 --> 00:13:49,131
preserves the shelf life
and quality of things.

00:13:49,197 --> 00:13:52,768
But that's typically food.

00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:54,503
(inhales deeply)

00:13:56,205 --> 00:13:59,441
"By any other name..."
Get it?

00:13:59,508 --> 00:14:02,144
"Would smell as sweet."

00:14:02,211 --> 00:14:03,579
Oh!

00:14:03,645 --> 00:14:05,414
(inhales deeply)

00:14:07,783 --> 00:14:09,785
Oh...

00:14:11,587 --> 00:14:13,021
Oh.

00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:27,064
Thank you.
You're welcome.

00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:34,280
(music playing)

00:14:41,988 --> 00:14:44,657
(music playing)

00:14:54,658 --> 00:14:56,560
WILLOWS:
<i>He just turned down the AC.</i>

00:14:56,627 --> 00:14:59,263
Must be getting
ready to cook.

00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,998
(light snoring)

00:15:01,065 --> 00:15:03,000
Dude...

00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:05,269
girl won't quit snoring.

00:15:05,336 --> 00:15:07,171
You don't pay hookers for sex,
buddy, you pay them to leave.

00:15:07,238 --> 00:15:08,339
Get her out of here.

00:15:08,405 --> 00:15:10,341
(knocking on door)

00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:12,676
VARTANN:
We got a situation.

00:15:12,743 --> 00:15:14,011
Somebody's at the door.

00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:16,647
Both suspects have
at least one gun each.

00:15:16,714 --> 00:15:18,816
Looks like Everett
has a .357.

00:15:18,882 --> 00:15:23,120
And Bell is packing a Colt .45.

00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:24,588
BRASS (over radio):
Copy that.

00:15:24,655 --> 00:15:26,557
It's a room service waiter
pushing a cart. Looks legit.

00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:28,158
More room service?

00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:30,794
(groaning)

00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:32,529
I forgot, yeah.

00:15:32,596 --> 00:15:34,698
You can order online here.

00:15:34,765 --> 00:15:37,034
I was craving
cheeseburgers, man.

00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:39,270
Don't let him in the room.

00:15:39,336 --> 00:15:42,406
We needed more
ice anyway.

00:15:44,108 --> 00:15:45,676
Should I
bring it in?

00:15:45,743 --> 00:15:46,844
Yeah, I got this.

00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:48,712
Yeah, I got this.

00:15:52,182 --> 00:15:54,184
(door closes)

00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:56,787
Hurry up, we got beans to cook.

00:15:56,854 --> 00:15:59,123
This isn't a freaking vacation.

00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:00,891
That's confirmation.

00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,559
BELL:
You want a coffee?

00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:04,662
Back in college the girls
would always complain

00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:08,299
about their underwear being
stolen from the laundry room.

00:16:08,365 --> 00:16:09,767
It does give
a whole new meaning

00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,036
to the term "panty raid."

00:16:12,102 --> 00:16:14,171
You know, I spent a
lot of time in Japan.

00:16:14,238 --> 00:16:17,508
They actually have,
um, vending machines

00:16:17,575 --> 00:16:18,876
filled with used panties.

00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,110
Vending machines?

00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:22,379
Seriously?

00:16:22,446 --> 00:16:23,847
I've seen them.

00:16:23,914 --> 00:16:25,182
Okay, all right,

00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:28,252
so, this guy, Lon Rose,

00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:30,955
hosts a fetish show
for men who enjoy

00:16:31,021 --> 00:16:34,024
the scent of women's
<i>used</i> underwear?
Right.

00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:36,894
And because his clients
are so hardcore,

00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:41,332
he vacuum packs them because
it's all about that first whiff.

00:16:41,398 --> 00:16:42,800
(chuckling)

00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:46,203
Look, we smell with our
brains, not our noses.

00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,339
Every time we inhale
through our nostrils,

00:16:48,405 --> 00:16:50,608
<i>air enters the nasal cavity</i>

00:16:50,674 --> 00:16:55,012
<i>which contains millions</i>
<i>of olfactory receptor neurons,</i>

00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,815
<i>and when scent molecules</i>
<i>lock into the cilia,</i>

00:16:57,881 --> 00:16:59,383
<i>it creates an electrical signal</i>

00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:02,786
<i>that tells the brain</i>
<i>how to interpret the smell.</i>

00:17:02,853 --> 00:17:05,756
We follow our noses.
Exactly.

00:17:05,823 --> 00:17:07,191
Odors help us choose our mates,

00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:09,860
impacts our sex drive,
alters our hormone levels,

00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:11,028
even triggers memories.

00:17:11,095 --> 00:17:12,863
For example,

00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,398
any time I smell nail polish,

00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:16,400
I think about my first
girlfriend, Michelle.

00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:18,836
It's a long way
from vending machines.

00:17:18,903 --> 00:17:21,005
(phone chirps)

00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:24,842
They picked up Pudder.

00:17:28,946 --> 00:17:32,283
Mr. Pudder, you've got
quite a collection

00:17:32,349 --> 00:17:37,254
of women's panties
in your hotel room.

00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:38,789
Did you buy all
those at the show?

00:17:38,856 --> 00:17:42,126
Yes. And I would've bought more.

00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:45,095
That's why I came to Vegas.

00:17:45,162 --> 00:17:46,931
Well, you must've been

00:17:46,997 --> 00:17:49,500
angry...

00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,835
when Sasha Katsaros
kicked you out.

00:17:51,902 --> 00:17:53,637
She had no right.

00:17:53,704 --> 00:17:55,439
Yeah, is that why
you killed her?

00:17:55,506 --> 00:17:57,908
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:17:57,975 --> 00:18:00,744
Someone killed
Sasha Katsaros, Mr. Pudder.

00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:04,148
Whoever did it took her panties.

00:18:04,214 --> 00:18:06,250
You better hope we don't
find her underwear

00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:07,818
in your little collection.

00:18:16,493 --> 00:18:19,863
I would never go
to a loading dock.

00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,600
Those places smell horrible.

00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,602
And anyway,

00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:27,705
Miss K... not my type.

00:18:27,771 --> 00:18:30,507
So, what is your, um,

00:18:30,574 --> 00:18:33,110
your type?

00:18:33,177 --> 00:18:35,012
(snickers)

00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:38,148
Well...

00:18:38,215 --> 00:18:43,287
When it comes to the,
uh, chamber of Venus,

00:18:43,354 --> 00:18:47,658
I have a very
sophisticated palate.

00:18:48,626 --> 00:18:50,194
You know,

00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:52,529
a woman's aroma is...

00:18:52,596 --> 00:18:53,898
(inhaling deeply)

00:18:53,964 --> 00:18:57,234
(moans)
It's complex,

00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:58,402
you know?

00:18:58,469 --> 00:19:00,771
And when all of the conditions

00:19:00,838 --> 00:19:02,539
are just right...

00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:09,179
...there's nothing to compare.

00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:13,150
(clearing throat)

00:19:13,217 --> 00:19:16,887
Look, why don't you just talk
to that charlatan Lon Rose?

00:19:16,954 --> 00:19:19,023
He'll tell you.

00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:21,358
I only bought off
of one model.

00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:23,093
Brenda.

00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,896
After all the money
I dropped on her last year,

00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:28,465
I slipped a pair
off of her last night--

00:19:28,532 --> 00:19:29,733
I'd earned it.

00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,736
Can you tell us what you did
after you had been

00:19:32,803 --> 00:19:34,505
ejected for the
second time?

00:19:34,572 --> 00:19:38,342
I hooked up with another buyer,
paid him to buy up

00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:39,910
Brenda's whole table.

00:19:39,977 --> 00:19:42,379
He dropped off the
merchandise around 11:00...

00:19:43,414 --> 00:19:46,150
...and I blissed out in my room

00:19:46,216 --> 00:19:48,852
for the rest of the night.

00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:50,187
Holed up in your hotel room

00:19:50,254 --> 00:19:53,524
with a bunch of women's panties
is not an alibi.

00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:54,792
(low chuckle)

00:19:56,026 --> 00:20:00,130
If you'd ever tried it,
you'd know it was.

00:20:00,197 --> 00:20:02,166
(chuckling)

00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:05,836
We're gonna need a sample

00:20:05,903 --> 00:20:08,472
of your fingerprints
and your DNA.

00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:10,874
Right hand, please.

00:20:10,941 --> 00:20:13,944
Is that thing clean?

00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:15,779
I hope so.

00:20:15,846 --> 00:20:16,981
(beeping)

00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:18,983
Sticks.

00:20:22,486 --> 00:20:24,421
BELL:
Okay, it's show time.

00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:27,992
EVERETT:
Just get the stuff
we need for now.

00:20:28,058 --> 00:20:31,495
How long does it take
to make Ecstasy?

00:20:31,562 --> 00:20:33,731
(sighing)

00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:35,432
Well, let's see.

00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:39,203
We could go shoot some craps,
play a little blackjack,

00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,072
have a long lunch,
go shopping.

00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:44,742
Or you could take me
to the new Cirque show.

00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:46,343
Maybe dinner.

00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:50,514
And... maybe about halfway done.

00:20:50,581 --> 00:20:52,816
Wow.

00:20:52,883 --> 00:20:54,385
You're not a cheap date.

00:20:54,451 --> 00:20:55,920
Not anymore.

00:20:55,986 --> 00:20:58,155
No.
(laughing)

00:20:58,222 --> 00:21:01,892
Seriously, it all depends
on the recipe

00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,928
and the, uh, skill of the cook.

00:21:03,994 --> 00:21:06,664
Well, it's noon now.

00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,632
Intel says that it's a surge
that starts at 10:00,

00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:10,034
they just don't know where.

00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,704
I'm assuming surge
is another term for a rave?

00:21:13,771 --> 00:21:15,773
The underground scene
uses different terms.

00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:18,609
"Surge" is slang
for an inside party.

00:21:18,676 --> 00:21:20,611
A "doof" is outside.

00:21:20,678 --> 00:21:23,614
Surge because of the feeling
you get from E,

00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:24,982
but "doof"?

00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:28,819
Doof, it's the sound
that the bass makes

00:21:28,886 --> 00:21:32,022
when there are no walls
to reverberate off of.

00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:33,824
You know, "doof, doof,

00:21:33,891 --> 00:21:36,093
doof, doof."
Yeah, I get it.

00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,696
(phone chirps)

00:21:38,762 --> 00:21:40,764
(clears throat)

00:21:47,371 --> 00:21:50,207
Is that a text
from your daughter?

00:21:50,274 --> 00:21:51,709
(sighing)

00:21:51,775 --> 00:21:54,411
Lindsey wants to visit
a friend at USC.

00:21:54,478 --> 00:21:58,816
I said no way,
and she just won't drop it.

00:21:58,882 --> 00:22:02,319
She graduates
this year, right?

00:22:02,386 --> 00:22:03,721
Well, you'll miss

00:22:03,787 --> 00:22:05,789
the fights some day.

00:22:05,856 --> 00:22:07,791
Yeah, I know.

00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:10,060
I even miss my son's
horrible techno music.

00:22:11,328 --> 00:22:13,764
You've never talked
about your son.

00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,435
Um, Jake.

00:22:18,502 --> 00:22:20,838
He just, uh, turned 21.

00:22:22,072 --> 00:22:24,575
Yeah, my ex got custody,
but, uh, he was a handful,

00:22:24,642 --> 00:22:27,077
so he ended up living with me
for high school.

00:22:27,144 --> 00:22:29,480
I always thought

00:22:29,546 --> 00:22:31,749
that I was...

00:22:31,815 --> 00:22:33,984
you know, better alone,

00:22:34,051 --> 00:22:36,120
you know?

00:22:36,186 --> 00:22:38,756
But I miss having someone

00:22:38,822 --> 00:22:40,824
to come home to.

00:22:48,766 --> 00:22:51,135
I didn't mean
to put you on the spot.

00:22:53,938 --> 00:22:56,373
Just wanted you to know.

00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,952
(helicopter blades whirring)

00:23:11,822 --> 00:23:14,258
My uncle was obsessed

00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:16,727
with the smell
of chocolate chip cookies.

00:23:16,794 --> 00:23:19,897
One day my aunt came home
and found him with his head

00:23:19,964 --> 00:23:21,065
in the oven,

00:23:21,131 --> 00:23:22,700
thought he was
committing suicide.

00:23:22,766 --> 00:23:27,805
She realized at that instant
the secret to a happy marriage--

00:23:27,871 --> 00:23:30,975
fresh-baked cookies every day.

00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,943
You're really
kind of freaky, Doc.

00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,144
(laughs)

00:23:34,211 --> 00:23:36,513
Coming from you, I'll take that
as a compliment.

00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,715
You're welcome.

00:23:37,781 --> 00:23:40,718
I found a contusion on her back

00:23:40,784 --> 00:23:43,821
and, uh, a couple
of fractured ribs.

00:23:43,887 --> 00:23:45,189
It's a partial shoe impression.

00:23:45,256 --> 00:23:46,390
David found

00:23:46,457 --> 00:23:48,492
a corresponding
mark on her jacket.

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,261
No distinguishing
features.

00:23:50,327 --> 00:23:52,263
Hmm. So,

00:23:52,329 --> 00:23:53,831
our victim
was grabbed

00:23:53,898 --> 00:23:55,766
and then kicked.

00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:57,635
Let me go! Oh.

00:23:57,701 --> 00:23:59,837
(yells)

00:24:01,171 --> 00:24:03,140
That would explain
the broken neck

00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:05,843
and the, uh,
scalp lacerations.

00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,512
Vascular birthmark

00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:10,347
shaped like a strawberry.

00:24:10,414 --> 00:24:13,117
You know, in Arabic
they're called <i>Wiham.</i>

00:24:13,183 --> 00:24:14,618
That translates to "wishes,"

00:24:14,685 --> 00:24:16,453
and believed to be a sign

00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,723
of a mother's
unfulfilled dreams.

00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:23,494
SIMMS:
Hey.

00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,962
Hey.

00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:27,531
So, I just finished analyzing
your victim's SAE kit.
Yeah?

00:24:27,598 --> 00:24:30,701
I found one plus spermatozoa,
but no indication of trauma.

00:24:30,768 --> 00:24:33,070
Okay. She had sex,
but she wasn't raped.

00:24:33,137 --> 00:24:34,338
Right.
We know whose it is?

00:24:34,405 --> 00:24:35,973
Yeah. It was an unknown male.

00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,207
It wasn't Pudder.

00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:41,679
Is that the bra
she was wearing when she died?

00:24:41,745 --> 00:24:44,715
Yeah.

00:24:44,782 --> 00:24:46,650
I don't think Pudder
took her panties.

00:24:46,717 --> 00:24:47,818
Based on what?

00:24:47,885 --> 00:24:49,620
Based on the fact
that I didn't receive

00:24:49,687 --> 00:24:51,088
any black underwear like that
with pink satin trim

00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:52,289
in any of the lingerie

00:24:52,356 --> 00:24:54,491
that was retrieved
from Pudder's room.

00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:55,893
And...?

00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,127
Okay, stay with me.

00:24:57,194 --> 00:24:59,196
That right there
is an Amatore bra.

00:24:59,263 --> 00:25:01,632
Now, it's really nice,
it's really expensive,

00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:03,133
and if a woman buys a bra
like that,

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,735
then one, she always buys
the matching underwear,

00:25:04,802 --> 00:25:07,204
and two, she wears them
together as a set.

00:25:07,271 --> 00:25:08,572
It's a thing.

00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:10,341
Maybe it was in the wash.

00:25:10,407 --> 00:25:12,243
Yeah. No. She would never put
underwear like that

00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:13,577
in a washing machine.

00:25:13,644 --> 00:25:15,079
Why not?

00:25:15,145 --> 00:25:16,914
Just trust me.
I'm an expert.

00:25:24,255 --> 00:25:26,890
WILLOWS: So Bell just
brought in more ice.

00:25:26,957 --> 00:25:28,859
They're probably bathing
the condensate.

00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:31,528
It's the most dangerous part.

00:25:33,297 --> 00:25:35,566
<i>If I'm right,</i>
<i>they just completed</i>

00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:39,536
<i>the Wacker oxidation stage</i>
<i>to keep the temperature down.</i>

00:25:40,838 --> 00:25:42,606
<i>The chemical reaction</i>
<i>is exothermic,</i>

00:25:42,673 --> 00:25:44,675
<i>it gives off a lot of heat.</i>

00:25:47,177 --> 00:25:49,880
<i>From this point on,</i>
<i>they've got to keep the mixture</i>

00:25:49,947 --> 00:25:52,383
<i>below 40 degrees Celsius</i>
<i>at all times.</i>

00:25:52,449 --> 00:25:54,685
Or what? It goes bad?

00:25:54,752 --> 00:25:56,687
No.

00:25:56,754 --> 00:25:58,756
It explodes.

00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:10,779
How you holding up?

00:26:10,846 --> 00:26:14,316
Finding that woman's body
was pretty intense.

00:26:16,218 --> 00:26:17,519
But... (laughs)

00:26:17,586 --> 00:26:19,221
You know, these bodies here

00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:22,891
are making that memory
fade pretty fast.

00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:24,893
It's all right, Archie.

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,362
It gets easier.

00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:29,197
(mutters)

00:26:29,264 --> 00:26:30,799
I've been going over
Rose's sales

00:26:30,866 --> 00:26:33,769
for the last 24 hours.

00:26:33,835 --> 00:26:35,837
Quite an inventory.

00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,172
Let me tell you,

00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:39,975
this is one
recession-proof industry.

00:26:42,466 --> 00:26:44,235
Enlarge and enhance
this photo for me.

00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:46,771
I want a look
at her clavicle.
Yeah.

00:26:47,838 --> 00:26:50,208
Our victim had a
strawberry-shaped birthmark.

00:26:50,274 --> 00:26:53,044
<i>That</i> is Sasha Katsaros.

00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,047
Oh, I... I thought she worked
at the hotel.

00:26:56,113 --> 00:26:59,917
Apparently, she wasn't making
enough money at her day job.

00:27:01,385 --> 00:27:03,221
I'll see you guys
tomorrow, okay?

00:27:03,287 --> 00:27:04,722
Mr. Rose?

00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:05,723
(clears throat)

00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,259
There's been a
development

00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:10,027
in Sasha Katsaros' case.

00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:11,195
Oh, good news.

00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:12,563
You caught the guy.

00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,232
LANGSTON:
We're circling him.

00:27:14,298 --> 00:27:17,068
Why didn't you tell us that
Sasha was one of your models?

00:27:17,134 --> 00:27:19,237
Well, you didn't ask.

00:27:19,303 --> 00:27:20,504
You didn't think
that's important

00:27:20,571 --> 00:27:21,706
in a murder investigation?

00:27:21,772 --> 00:27:24,108
Look,

00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,577
she, uh, made me promise.

00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,613
She loved her job here
at the hotel.

00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:31,449
That's... that's why
she never did live modeling.

00:27:31,515 --> 00:27:33,417
That's her table, isn't it?

00:27:33,484 --> 00:27:35,419
Yeah.

00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:37,655
My biggest seller.

00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,857
Guys went crazy
over her scent.

00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,995
You guys think my business

00:27:44,061 --> 00:27:48,232
is for undersexed husbands
or losers who can't get any?

00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,401
Yeah, something
like that, yeah.

00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:53,404
Well, I might have thought that,
too, if I hadn't met Sasha.

00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:56,140
You see, she was my inspiration

00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:57,742
for starting the business.

00:27:57,808 --> 00:28:00,278
I fell in love
with the way she smelled.

00:28:00,344 --> 00:28:02,880
Well, her killer
liked her smell, too.

00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:07,652
So much so that he took a pair
of her panties as a souvenir.

00:28:07,718 --> 00:28:10,187
This is for you.
There's an officer

00:28:10,254 --> 00:28:13,024
outside who will
escort you downtown.

00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:15,960
Yeah, we're just going to sniff
around, if you don't mind.

00:28:25,636 --> 00:28:27,838
Sasha gave them to me yesterday.

00:28:27,905 --> 00:28:30,441
Sasha, darling,
they can't get enough.

00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,310
I need more product.
(chuckles)

00:28:32,376 --> 00:28:34,612
Well, I can't go home.
I'm working.

00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,547
Well, what about the ones
you're wearing?

00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:38,516
I could sell those as fresh.

00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,551
Get a premium.

00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:41,686
(sighs)

00:28:50,928 --> 00:28:53,197
Ah.
Oh.

00:28:55,032 --> 00:28:58,536
Look, I swear I didn't
kill Sasha. I loved her.

00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:01,739
We're going to need
a sample of your DNA.
You think I had sex with her?

00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:02,874
Did you?
I would never

00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,141
have sex with Sasha.

00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:06,544
That'd be like scribbling
on the Mona Lisa.

00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:08,412
It would kill my business.

00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:11,215
And these-- turns out
they're worthless.

00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:12,884
Yeah, well, they're not yours
anymore; they're ours now.

00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,051
Give them to me.

00:29:14,118 --> 00:29:16,387
Sex changes a woman's
body chemistry,

00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,589
which alters the fragrance.

00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:21,559
Look, she should've
known better.

00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,594
But the nose knows.

00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:29,100
BELL:
No, no, no, no, l-listen to me.

00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:33,204
I don't... no, no, I don't care
how big her boobs are. I...

00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,840
Oh, I'm so tired
of white chicks. Um...

00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,142
Give me...
give me an Asian chick.

00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:39,443
No, you know what?

00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,912
Make that two
Asian chicks.

00:29:40,978 --> 00:29:41,946
I want...
(phone beeps off)

00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:43,147
No more hookers.
Whoa!

00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,949
We've got to finish.
We only got three hours.

00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:47,885
Ev, you've got to relax.

00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,687
We're the sole suppliers

We don't deliver,
they don't roll.

00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:53,658
Dude, what's going to happen
if we're five minutes late?

00:29:53,724 --> 00:29:54,992
You on a suicide mission, Bell?

00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,961
We ruin this guy's
surge, we're dead.

00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,162
He won't care how rich

00:29:58,229 --> 00:29:59,430
your daddy is.
Hey, no.

00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:01,799
Hey, uh-uh. Don't talk to me
like that, okay?

00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:04,835
You owe me. I'm the one
that got us out of the
mess in Tahoe, pal.

00:30:04,902 --> 00:30:06,938
You're the one that got us
in the mess...
Oh, come on, no.

00:30:07,004 --> 00:30:09,173
Don't put that on me, all right?
You cooked the beans.

00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,641
You're the one
that screwed up the ratio.

00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:11,742
Yeah, 'cause you lied to me

00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:13,344
about what you put...
(shouts)
Shut up.

00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:16,180
Shut up, Ev.
Shut up, or I will shoot you.

If that's room service,

00:30:18,382 --> 00:30:20,351
I'm going to shoot you.
Who's at the door?

00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:22,153
They are friends of mine.

00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,121
It is a private sale.

00:30:24,188 --> 00:30:25,523
Get rid of them.

00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,392
I paid for the room,
so just back off.

00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:31,395
Belly Bell!
Mmm, Jilly-Jill.

00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:32,630
You are looking good.

00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:34,732
(Jill giggling)
How you
doing, baby?

00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,602
Who are you?
You the BF?

00:30:37,668 --> 00:30:38,636
We need a hook-up.

00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:40,638
Well...

00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:43,774
She's obviously trippin' balls,
so you're out of luck.

00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:46,444
We're, uh, we're
not ready yet.

00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,546
I can feel your energy, Belly.

00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:51,315
It's, like, ice cream.

00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,519
I love your soul.

00:30:55,586 --> 00:30:56,721
Get off her, man.

00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:02,760

00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:06,831

00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,866
Get up, Jill.
This is like

00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,635
the softest thing on Earth.

00:31:10,701 --> 00:31:11,636
Now!

00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:13,004
Come on, Jill.

00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,038
Hey!

00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:15,072
You're not going anywhere,

00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:16,440
except hell.

00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,112
All right, we got a possible
444 developing here.

speaking indistinctly)

00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:29,754
Hey, buddy, you
looking for these?

00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,822
Yeah.

00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:33,524
But first I'm going
to kill your boy here.

00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:36,027
Oh, you gotta know, I'm not
going to let that happen.

00:31:36,994 --> 00:31:39,397
Besides, we start shooting,

00:31:39,463 --> 00:31:41,199
whole place goes boom.

00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,569
Take them.

00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:45,770
On the house.

00:31:45,836 --> 00:31:47,071
Ooh, I'll take them.

00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:48,472
Grab your lady and bounce.

00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,142
Babe.

00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,045
Do you guys want to come?

00:31:54,111 --> 00:31:55,079
Get out.

00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:56,347

<i>Okay, stand down, stand down.</i>

00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:07,592
grab the male and female.

00:32:07,658 --> 00:32:08,793
The guy's armed.
He's got a revolver

00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:09,994
inside his jacket.

00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,529
Hold them
until I get there.

00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,531
BELL: We only got a couple more
hours. Let's go.

00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,899
Hey, uh,

00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:16,601
you want me to send
one of my guys

00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:17,969
up here, keep you company?

00:32:18,035 --> 00:32:20,104
I'm solid.

00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,940
I'll leave the radio.

00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:32,984
Wendy.
Hmm?

00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,318
Here's Lon Rose's exemplar.

00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:35,653
I need you to compare it

00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,122
to the male contribution found
in the victim's SAE kit.

00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:39,123
Okay.

00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,492
And... victim's underwear.

00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,761
I was right.
Yes.

00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:45,897
You were.
Thanks for the insight.
JOHNSON: Hey, Nick.

00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:47,298
Yeah?

00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:49,033
You're going to want
to see this.

00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,837
I was reviewing the victim's
key card history for you.

00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,839
According to the hotel's
security card database,

00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:57,842
somebody's
currently using it.

00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,143
That's impossible.

00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,412
Sasha's key card is
still in evidence.

00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:16,294
Let me see that thing.

00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,996
(beeping)

00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,171
Didn't see that coming.

00:33:37,321 --> 00:33:39,256
Just wrapped up.

00:33:39,323 --> 00:33:40,691
We didn't get anything
from the boyfriend,

00:33:40,758 --> 00:33:41,926
but we did get
a location

00:33:41,993 --> 00:33:44,595
for the surge from
the E-tard girl, Jill.

00:33:44,662 --> 00:33:46,464
It's an abandoned building
just west of Red Rock.

00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:47,631
I've been to parties there.

00:33:47,698 --> 00:33:50,668
Well, I used to be
down with PLUR.

00:33:50,735 --> 00:33:52,436
It's an acronym for
"Peace, Love,

00:33:52,503 --> 00:33:53,437
Unity, Respect."

00:33:53,504 --> 00:33:56,007
It's like the, uh, rave motto.

00:33:56,073 --> 00:33:58,676
Anyways, it was a long time ago,
but I know the scene.

00:33:58,743 --> 00:33:59,777
You pass your drug tests?

00:33:59,844 --> 00:34:01,178
Of course.

00:34:01,245 --> 00:34:02,780
Consider yourself recruited.

00:34:02,847 --> 00:34:04,482
Okay, the
surveillance team

00:34:04,548 --> 00:34:05,683
that's in place at the casino--

00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,118
they'll follow Everett and Bell
when they leave.

00:34:07,184 --> 00:34:08,653
I'll keep the backup units
at a distance.

00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,054
Do you want to pick them up

00:34:10,121 --> 00:34:11,789
before they get to the party,
or after they distribute?

00:34:11,856 --> 00:34:13,491
No, I want them
for distribution to minors.

00:34:13,557 --> 00:34:15,459
Give the DA something
rock solid to deal with,

00:34:15,526 --> 00:34:17,128
something they can't skate on.
All set?

00:34:17,194 --> 00:34:18,696
I'll head back upstairs.

00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:25,177
Mr. Thomas.

00:34:25,243 --> 00:34:26,578
Oh, hey.

00:34:26,645 --> 00:34:28,146
Gentlemen, can
I help you?

00:34:28,213 --> 00:34:29,347
Yeah, I hope so.

00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:33,418
Sasha's key card
is still active.

00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:35,353
What, you mean
somebody's using it?

00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,988
Probably her killer.

00:34:37,055 --> 00:34:38,990
But, you see,
the thing is

00:34:39,057 --> 00:34:42,327
we already found a card
in her jacket.

00:34:42,394 --> 00:34:44,362
Oh.

00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:46,398
May I see
your key card, please?

00:34:46,464 --> 00:34:48,200
Yes, absolutely.

00:34:48,266 --> 00:34:50,001
(chuckles)

00:34:50,068 --> 00:34:51,069
Uh, you know what?

00:34:51,136 --> 00:34:53,305
I, uh, I think
I left it at my desk.

00:34:53,371 --> 00:34:54,439
This is embarrassing.

00:34:54,506 --> 00:34:55,674
I'll be right back.
No, no,

00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,409
no, no, no.

00:34:59,411 --> 00:35:01,646
We'll just check
your pockets right here.

(beeping)

00:35:23,134 --> 00:35:25,103
LANGSTON: How do you
explain that, Mr. Thomas?

00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:29,241
Look, when I met Sasha,
I knew she was special.

00:35:29,307 --> 00:35:31,776
Hell, after the third date,
I wanted to marry her.

00:35:35,714 --> 00:35:38,316
Then she booked that...
that lingerie job.

00:35:38,383 --> 00:35:40,085
It made me sick

00:35:40,151 --> 00:35:42,954
to think of her sharing
herself with all those...

00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:44,456
perverts.

00:35:44,523 --> 00:35:47,392
So we had it out,

00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:48,994
she promised to quit.

00:35:50,328 --> 00:35:52,264
She lied.

00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,665
Wait a minute.

00:35:53,732 --> 00:35:56,468
You're going to choose
a bunch of perverts over me?

00:35:56,535 --> 00:35:57,569
They're not perverts.

00:35:57,636 --> 00:35:58,837
They're fans--
they're my fans.

00:35:58,904 --> 00:35:59,971
You shouldn't be jealous.

00:36:00,038 --> 00:36:01,540
Are you kidding me here?

00:36:01,606 --> 00:36:02,641
Look, Finn,

00:36:02,707 --> 00:36:04,276

my lifestyle,

00:36:04,342 --> 00:36:06,111

Wait, wait a minute.

You don't understand.

She was everything to me.

00:36:20,025 --> 00:36:21,593
I couldn't live without her.

00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,463
No, Mr. Thomas, you couldn't
let her live without you.

00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,933
Let's go.

(muffled):
Slow.

00:40:12,524 --> 00:40:15,660
(techno plays)

00:40:20,498 --> 00:40:21,833
Bell, let's go, man.

00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,834
I'm good.

00:40:22,901 --> 00:40:23,869
No, come on, let's go.

00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:25,070
(laughs)

00:40:25,136 --> 00:40:27,505
Whoo! Whoo!
(mutters)

00:40:49,027 --> 00:40:51,229
Hey, uh, can I get another roll?

00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:54,566
I lost the other one.

00:41:02,774 --> 00:41:04,276
Thanks, man.
(gun hammer cocks)

00:41:04,342 --> 00:41:06,244
Don't move.

00:41:06,311 --> 00:41:09,381
Don't even twitch, or this
will be your last party.

00:41:09,447 --> 00:41:12,284
Stay right there.

00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:13,585
You're under arrest.

00:41:13,652 --> 00:41:14,586
OFFICER:
Let's go, pal.

00:41:14,653 --> 00:41:16,588
The party's over.

00:41:16,655 --> 00:41:17,689
What's the 20 on Bell?

00:41:17,756 --> 00:41:18,723
He was back there

00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,426
a minute ago,
but he's gone.

00:41:24,963 --> 00:41:27,866
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:41:27,933 --> 00:41:28,934
(camera shutter snaps)

00:41:30,035 --> 00:41:31,269
Hey, they
arrested Everett.

00:41:31,336 --> 00:41:32,904
They're still searching
for Bell in the crowd.

00:41:32,971 --> 00:41:34,439
Almost done.

00:41:34,506 --> 00:41:37,843
The chemicals are sealed and
secure, HazMat's on their way,

00:41:37,909 --> 00:41:39,778
and we'll need to pack up
those suitcases

00:41:39,845 --> 00:41:41,112
and take them with us.

00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:42,414
Okay, you got it.

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,083
DISPATCHER: ...in or out of any
exits at this time.

00:41:47,485 --> 00:41:49,120
OFFICER:
Adam 2-2, copy that.

00:41:49,187 --> 00:41:52,023
We are currently in the back
alleyway of the Diamond Dust.

00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:54,626
(door opens)

00:41:54,693 --> 00:41:57,829
BELL:
No, dude, I snuck out
a side door.

00:41:57,896 --> 00:41:59,431
Yeah.

00:41:59,497 --> 00:42:01,666
No, the cop... the cops don't...
they don't know where I am.

00:42:01,733 --> 00:42:03,635
I don't know what
happened to Ev.

00:42:04,669 --> 00:42:07,172
Just... just come get me.

00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:08,707
Just-just come get me...

00:42:08,773 --> 00:42:10,742
DISPATCHER:
Confirm suspects are in custody.

00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:13,111
BRASS: We do not have
the second suspect in custody.

00:42:13,178 --> 00:42:15,914
Repeat, we do not have
the second suspect in custody.

00:42:15,981 --> 00:42:17,015
DISPATCHER:
Copy that.

00:42:17,082 --> 00:42:19,784
Confirm that the suspect
is still at large.

00:42:29,928 --> 00:42:30,929
(gun hammer cocks)

00:42:36,201 --> 00:42:39,538
(soft rustling)

00:42:39,604 --> 00:42:44,876
(garbled radio transmissions)

00:42:46,778 --> 00:42:48,180
(grunts, sniffles)

00:42:48,246 --> 00:42:52,617
DISPATCHER: Any available units
to Diamond Dust Hotel.

00:42:52,684 --> 00:42:54,019
OFFICER:
...1-2, yeah, stand by

00:42:54,085 --> 00:42:56,788
and we'll check with the watch
commander in your area.

00:42:58,089 --> 00:43:00,692
(grunts)

00:43:07,532 --> 00:43:12,103
(grunts continue)

00:43:20,812 --> 00:43:22,080
(gunshot)

00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:28,119
(panting)
