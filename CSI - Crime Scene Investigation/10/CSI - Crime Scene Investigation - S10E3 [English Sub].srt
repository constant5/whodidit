00:00:04,542 --> 00:00:06,544
(crickets chirping)

00:00:17,688 --> 00:00:19,223
(yelling)

00:00:20,525 --> 00:00:22,527
(yelling wildly)

00:00:36,174 --> 00:00:37,742
Hiker spotted the body

00:00:37,808 --> 00:00:40,511
from that rise just after dawn.

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,988
(camera shutter clicks)

00:00:51,055 --> 00:00:52,089
LANGSTON:
Whoever did this

00:00:52,156 --> 00:00:53,491
put a lot more effort

00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:55,626
into the killing
than the concealing.

00:00:55,693 --> 00:00:57,562
Looks like it might have been
spur-of-the-moment.

00:00:57,628 --> 00:00:59,964
Or he didn't care if the victim
was found, either way.

00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:01,299
Go ahead and roll him, Dave.

00:01:07,805 --> 00:01:09,841
STOKES:
If the killer's smart,

00:01:09,907 --> 00:01:11,275
<i>he's already out of town,</i>

00:01:11,342 --> 00:01:12,844
<i>laying</i>
<i>on a beach somewhere,</i>

00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,679
<i>drinking a margarita.</i>

00:01:14,745 --> 00:01:17,148
LANGSTON:
<i>Well, let's hope he's not</i>
<i>all that smart, then.</i>

00:01:17,215 --> 00:01:18,616
<i>Any I.D. on him?</i>

00:01:18,683 --> 00:01:20,484
PHILLIPS:
Mmm. There's no wallet,

00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:22,186
there's no cell, and
there's no keys,

00:01:22,253 --> 00:01:25,656
unless you want to count
this bicycle lock thingy.

00:01:26,691 --> 00:01:29,160
Body is just going
into rigor.

00:01:29,227 --> 00:01:31,529
LANGSTON:
So, probably killed
late last night.

00:01:31,596 --> 00:01:33,331
STOKES:
Those look like
defensive wounds

00:01:33,397 --> 00:01:34,932
on the wrist.

00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:36,200
LANGSTON:
Multiple head wounds,

00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:38,703
<i>any of which</i>
<i>could have been fatal.</i>

00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:41,472
STOKES:
<i>He pissed somebody off,</i>
<i>didn't he?</i>

00:01:44,408 --> 00:01:46,043
What's the angriest
you've ever been?

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,945
I've been mad enough
to kill somebody.

00:01:48,012 --> 00:01:49,113
Didn't do it.

00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,348
What about you?

00:01:50,414 --> 00:01:51,949
High threshold.

00:01:52,016 --> 00:01:53,117
Short fuse.

00:01:53,184 --> 00:01:54,886
PHILLIPS:
Me, too. In high school,

00:01:54,952 --> 00:01:59,290
I vented my frustrations
by devising elaborate tortures

00:01:59,357 --> 00:02:01,025
for my classmates.

00:02:02,059 --> 00:02:03,861
In comic book form, of course.

00:02:04,896 --> 00:02:06,998
Well, whether the killer

00:02:07,064 --> 00:02:08,132
<i>woke up this morning intending</i>

00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,834
<i>to beat this guy to death</i>
<i>or not,</i>

00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:12,470
<i>right now, he's a new man</i>
<i>with a new plan.</i>

00:02:12,537 --> 00:02:14,672
<i>And a big, fat secret.</i>

00:02:16,774 --> 00:02:18,843
LANGSTON:

00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,606
(camera shutter clicking)

00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,310
Tire tracks head
out to the road.

00:03:14,377 --> 00:03:16,246
They're fresh and deep.

00:03:16,312 --> 00:03:19,349
Driver must have floored it.

00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,750
But, then again,

00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:23,253
he had a good reason
to be in a hurry.

00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,522
I have two different sets

00:03:25,588 --> 00:03:27,857
of shoe impressions here,
in mud.

00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:30,126
It hasn't rained out here
for weeks.

00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:32,996
Could be melted ice
from a cooler.

00:03:33,063 --> 00:03:36,332
Locals sometimes use these woods
to get drunk,

00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:38,868
have target practice.

00:03:41,037 --> 00:03:42,972
No, this isn't alcohol.

00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,708
And he wasn't shot;
he was bludgeoned.

00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:00,457
ROBBINS:
<i>Victim's male Caucasian,</i>

00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:03,293
<i>five-foot-ten,</i>

00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:06,996
<i>155 pounds,</i>
<i>probably in his mid-20s,</i>

00:04:07,063 --> 00:04:12,001
<i>with multiple BFTs</i>
<i>to the head and back,</i>

00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:15,338
as well as severe
lacerations

00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:19,075
to the left wrist.

00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:20,510
Lack of hemorrhagic tissue

00:04:20,577 --> 00:04:22,479
indicates the wound
is postmortem.

00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:27,250
Wound tract: approximately
two centimeters deep,

00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:29,519
atypical for a defensive wound.

00:04:29,586 --> 00:04:31,755
<i>Which suggests the killer...</i>

00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:39,462
...was trying to dig...
something... out.

00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:47,237
This looks like
an implantable RFID.

00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:50,673
Radio Frequency
Identification chip.

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,243
I know. They're used for
tracking inventory at Wal-Mart.

00:04:53,309 --> 00:04:55,645
But unless the 13th Amendment
got repealed

00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,247
while I wasn't looking,

00:04:57,313 --> 00:04:58,848
that's not inventory.

00:04:58,915 --> 00:04:59,983
Implantable RFIDs
are pretty new.

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,384
There's some high-end
nightclubs

00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:02,986
that give them to their VIPs

00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,255
to make it easier for them
to run up a tab.

00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:06,423
(chuckling):
Oh, yeah.

00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:08,758
Having a chip surgically
implanted in your body

00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:10,760
is so much more convenient

00:05:10,827 --> 00:05:12,829
than putting a credit card
in your pocket.

00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,432
Well, not everything I wear out
has pockets.

00:05:15,498 --> 00:05:17,067
I'll buy you a purse.
All right.

00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:20,036
The chip itself looks intact.

00:05:20,103 --> 00:05:22,005
If I can get my hands
on a scanner,

00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,741
I might be able to tell
who this belongs to.

00:05:24,808 --> 00:05:26,543
MAN:
<i>No batteries required.</i>

00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:28,711
<i>Just a little movement</i>
<i>in a magnetic field</i>

00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:31,247
<i>to energize the circuit,</i>
<i>which transmits a code,</i>

00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:32,749
<i>which gets sent</i>
<i>to the access database,</i>

00:05:32,816 --> 00:05:34,117
and...
(buzzing and clicking)

00:05:34,184 --> 00:05:36,886
(sighs)
Just like magic.

00:05:36,953 --> 00:05:38,488
That's impressive.

00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:40,223
So, do you have
any other tricks

00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,225
up your, um, arm?

00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:43,226
MAN:
Belinda?

00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:44,994
I have those TPS reports...

00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:46,062
Jason, this is Paulie Krill,

00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:47,597
facilities
management.

00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:48,865
Paulie, this
is Jason Devereaux,

00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,266
our new I.T. guru.

00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,068
I.T. geek-- it's
okay to say it.

00:05:52,135 --> 00:05:55,338
I had an RFID surgically
implanted in my wrist.

00:05:55,405 --> 00:05:57,006
It's, uh, practically
the definition.

00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:58,608
Did it hurt?
No, it was, uh...

00:05:58,675 --> 00:06:00,944
it was a little like
getting a vaccination.

00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,545
Without the autism.

00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,748
Actually,
that's anecdotal.

00:06:04,814 --> 00:06:06,182
I read in...
I tell most people

00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:07,484
that it was a
suicide attempt.

00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,119
It makes me appear
dark and tormented.

00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:10,954
I bet the ladies
love that.

00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,822
You tell me.

00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:14,958
(clearing throat):
Lombard.

00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:18,194
Sounds to me like your
computer has a virus.

00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:19,996
BELINDA: Oh, that's
what I was afraid of.

00:06:20,063 --> 00:06:21,297
Ah, well, come with me.

00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:23,400
That's why we call
it the Help Desk.

00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,985
WOMAN: What?
Sorry.

00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,792
(beep, buzz)

00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:50,060
(door handle clicking)

00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:51,294
(beep, buzz)

00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:52,829
(door handle clicking)

00:06:52,896 --> 00:06:55,198
(beep, buzz,
rattling handle)

00:06:58,935 --> 00:07:01,438
(beeping, buzzing)
(groans)

00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,409
Where the hell
is Devereaux?

00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:07,844
I haven't seen him today.

00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:09,012
Something wrong?

00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,046
Yeah.

00:07:10,113 --> 00:07:11,414
It's, uh...

00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:13,883
Something is, uh...

00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,385
very wrong.

00:07:15,452 --> 00:07:17,220
Come here.

00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:18,555
No, come here, you...

00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:19,923
you've got something in your,

00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:21,057
something
in your hair.

00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:23,860
There, there,
there, there...

00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:27,130
There.

00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,198
Got it.

00:07:28,264 --> 00:07:29,799
Thank you.

00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,036
What are you looking at?

00:07:33,103 --> 00:07:35,071
A sexual harassment suit.

00:07:38,842 --> 00:07:40,577
(raspy, snorting laugh)

00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:42,312
You're a very funny guy.

00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,713
Hey.

00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,215
Tell, uh, little Jason

00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:47,417
that I want that
fixed ASAP.

00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:50,019
From now on, this is no longer
the Help Desk.

00:07:50,086 --> 00:07:53,022
It's just... the desk.

00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:56,025
Thanks.

00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:57,394
You're welcome.

00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,630
You ever think that some people
would be better off dead?

00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:03,900
What's gotten into you today?

00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:06,903
I don't know.

00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,238
Whatever it is,

00:08:08,304 --> 00:08:10,273
I like it.

00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:30,727
So, they say people have
a good side and a bad side.

00:08:30,794 --> 00:08:32,095
What's the verdict?

00:08:32,162 --> 00:08:34,597
I don't seem to have a bad side.

00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:40,003
What do you
have there?

00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,439
Metal fragment
from my crime scene.

00:08:43,673 --> 00:08:45,008
LANGSTON:
Mandy was able to pull

00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:46,910
a few small partials
and some smudges,

00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:48,478
but, uh...

00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:50,914
nothing with enough detail
to run through AFIS.

00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,482
It's magnetic,

00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:55,318
which means it's ferrous,
probably a steel alloy.

00:08:55,385 --> 00:08:57,153
Layered steel.

00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,621
Very high strength.

00:08:58,688 --> 00:09:00,757
That fine line pattern
looks like ferning.

00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:03,259
HODGES:
Material deformation resulting

00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:04,394
from explosive force.

00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,662
Yeah, possibly.

00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:08,631
You see that kind of
thing in a pipe bomb.

00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:10,033
Is that what this is from?

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,901
I don't know.

00:09:15,572 --> 00:09:17,941
(trilling, beeping)

00:09:19,943 --> 00:09:21,845
Come on, damn it.

00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:23,680
(beeping)

00:09:23,747 --> 00:09:24,781
(gasps)

00:09:24,848 --> 00:09:26,416
Yes.

00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:30,420
You sound happy.

00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:31,454
What's going on?

00:09:31,521 --> 00:09:33,156
I just got the
vic's name.

00:09:33,223 --> 00:09:34,724
Jason Devereaux.

00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,127
STOKES:
Nice.

00:09:37,193 --> 00:09:38,361
I'll track down
his phone records.

00:09:38,428 --> 00:09:39,796
He lives at 1120

00:09:39,863 --> 00:09:42,999
Marapasa Parkway,
apartment number one.

00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:44,868
STOKES: And he drives
a Ford Ranger.

00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:47,670
That's consistent with
the tire treads at the scene.

00:09:47,737 --> 00:09:49,372
Kill a man, take his car.

00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:50,907
Mmm. Bonus.

00:09:52,242 --> 00:09:53,910
STOKES:
Man, that's three messages

00:09:53,977 --> 00:09:55,645
I've left for
the property manager now.

00:09:55,712 --> 00:09:57,113
Maybe he's got
better things to do

00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,348
than cooperate
with the law.

00:09:58,415 --> 00:10:00,250
Wait, wait.
Hold up a sec.

00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:03,520
That's the victim's truck
right there.

00:10:03,586 --> 00:10:05,522
And trust me...

00:10:05,588 --> 00:10:08,725
he was in no condition
to drive it home.

00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:24,107
SANDERS:
Key's in the ignition.

00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:26,042
Door's unlocked.

00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:28,378
I'll check for prints.

00:10:30,814 --> 00:10:34,317
Looks like everything's
been wiped clean.

00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:37,654
Maybe not everything.

00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,356
Dispatch, this is
Charlie-Zero-Six Sanders.

00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:44,861
We need backup and tow
at 1120 Marapasa Parkway.

00:10:44,928 --> 00:10:46,930
DISPATCHER:
Copy that, Charlie-Zero-Six.

00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:50,767
Officers are already at
that location, responding 406.

00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,571
We came in on the other
side of the complex.

00:10:54,637 --> 00:10:56,639
That's why we
missed each other.

00:10:56,706 --> 00:10:58,174
Regular maid service

00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,243
entered the apartment
a few hours ago.

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,212
Found the place trashed,
called it in.

00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,115
The unit's
right back here.

00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:06,616
Most of the electronics
are gone.

00:11:06,683 --> 00:11:08,685
TV was probably too big
to carry out.

00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:27,137
Security cable's been cut.

00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:29,639
Killer didn't have a key.
It was on the victim's belt.

00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:33,309
So, the killer comes back
to the vic's apartment.

00:11:33,376 --> 00:11:34,644
Why?

00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:36,713
Maybe to get something that
ties him to the murder.

00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,515
A computer,
from the looks of it.

00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:39,916
That suggests that
the killer

00:11:39,983 --> 00:11:43,219
had a prior relationship
with the vic--

00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,722
family, friend, coworker.
Mm-hmm.

00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:49,159
Which means this...

00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:52,228
is a pretty good place
to start.

00:11:58,768 --> 00:11:59,869
Hey!

00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:01,471
Everybody shut up!

00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:03,807
And stop trying to look busy
for a minute,

00:12:03,873 --> 00:12:05,308
and give your attention
down here.

00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,476
BRASS:
Good afternoon.

00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:08,878
I'm, uh, Captain Jim Brass.

00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:10,814
I'm a detective

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,115
with the Las Vegas
Police Department.

00:12:12,182 --> 00:12:14,451
I'm sorry to break up
your day like this,

00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:16,352
but I'm here about
Jason Devereaux.

00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:17,520
BELINDA:
He's not in yet.

00:12:17,587 --> 00:12:19,189
What is this about?
Mr. Devereaux

00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:21,191
is the subject of an active
investigation.

00:12:21,257 --> 00:12:23,793
I'll be talking to all of you
individually.

00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,296
These officers will pick up
your contact information.

00:12:26,362 --> 00:12:28,031
I promise it won't
take too long.

00:12:28,098 --> 00:12:30,066
Thank you in advance
for your cooperation.

00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:32,635
(staffers murmuring)

00:12:32,702 --> 00:12:34,471
He's a hacker.

00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:36,473
Bet it's
a hacker thing.

00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:39,642
Probably some high-tech
black market credit card scam.

00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:42,645
I read about it
in <i>Wired.</i>

00:12:42,712 --> 00:12:44,714
Some people,
you just can't tell.

00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:51,985
Well, all I know is the kid
was here yesterday,

00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:53,820
he wasn't here today.

00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,822
And since he didn't
bother calling,

00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:58,658
he's also fired,
so you know.

00:12:58,725 --> 00:13:00,493
That's the least
of his problems.

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,729
LOMBARD:
Well, I got just the
place for you.

00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:05,732
You pull the blinds, it's
totally private and quiet.

00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:08,735
You can pull out the
rubber hose, nobody
will even know.

00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:10,403
You know, I'm curious, uh,

00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,839
do have you any problems with
disgruntled employees lately?

00:13:12,906 --> 00:13:14,874
(scoffs)
No more than usual.

00:13:14,941 --> 00:13:17,043
I mean, come on, you know
what we do here.

00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,478
Yeah, I can read
the sign.

00:13:18,545 --> 00:13:21,247
You're a support operations
for the Tangiers.

00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:23,183
Which mean we laminate badges,
distribute uniforms,

00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:24,584
and issue parking permits.

00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:28,655
We are the testicles of the
casino business, my friend.

00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:30,690
If you're working here,

00:13:30,757 --> 00:13:32,859
it's not 'cause
you want to be.

00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:37,363
(camera shutter clicking)

00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:46,673
Action figures and anime
for the computer guy.

00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:48,341
It's almost a cliché.

00:13:48,408 --> 00:13:49,742
Let me guess,
you were a GI Joe man?

00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:52,779
No, but... my dad was.

00:13:52,846 --> 00:13:56,015
Hey, Nick, we're
finished up here.

00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:57,884
Want me to help Barnes?
All right, go ahead.

00:13:57,951 --> 00:14:00,720
LANGSTON: Nick, what do
you make of this?

00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:04,757
Looks like a long portrait.

00:14:04,824 --> 00:14:07,961
They're big on
photo-sharing sites.

00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:11,397
Video art.
With a little narcissism.

00:14:11,464 --> 00:14:13,233
Well, one's not much
without the other.

00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,401
So, all electronic data
goes back to the lab.

00:14:15,468 --> 00:14:17,437
I'll do the honors.

00:14:17,503 --> 00:14:19,806
Yeah, hold on there, Doctor,
I'll save you the hassle.

00:14:19,873 --> 00:14:21,774
I've got a drive duplicator
in my truck.

00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:23,843
I'll go grab it.
All right.

00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:41,477
According to Mr. Devereaux's
phone records,

00:14:41,544 --> 00:14:43,746
the two of you called each
other several times last night.

00:14:43,813 --> 00:14:45,748
I'm his direct supervisor;
we talk all the time.

00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:48,083
Most of the calls were
after 11:00 p.m.

00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,921
Jason said he was
dealing with some sort
of mail server glitch.

00:14:51,987 --> 00:14:53,355
I.T.'s always dealing
with something.

00:14:53,422 --> 00:14:55,090
(wry chuckle)

00:14:56,492 --> 00:14:58,360
I thought it takes,
like, 48 hours

00:14:58,427 --> 00:15:00,396
to report someone missing,

00:15:00,463 --> 00:15:04,533
so this can't be about him
not showing up for work.

00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,035
You seem
more concerned about him

00:15:06,102 --> 00:15:07,570
than the rest of
your colleagues.

00:15:07,636 --> 00:15:08,737
We're friends.

00:15:08,804 --> 00:15:10,506
I just want to know...

00:15:10,573 --> 00:15:11,974
He's dead.

00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:15,744
I'm going to be informing
the rest of your coworkers,

00:15:15,811 --> 00:15:18,047
individually,
about that fact.

00:15:18,114 --> 00:15:21,117
Please don't discuss it
with anybody, okay?

00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:25,087
(whirring, blipping)

00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:31,093
Hmm.

00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,096
There are virtually no personal
files on his computer.

00:15:34,163 --> 00:15:36,098
Yeah, what do you
make of that?

00:15:36,165 --> 00:15:38,234
Some people
take their privacy seriously.

00:15:43,105 --> 00:15:45,674
STOKES: His files have
to be somewhere.

00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:50,412
This thing's set up to remotely
access another machine.

00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:52,314
How much you want to
bet it's the laptop

00:15:52,381 --> 00:15:53,916
stolen from his apartment?

00:15:55,551 --> 00:15:58,487
Killed?

00:15:58,554 --> 00:16:03,726
My God,
that's... terrible.

00:16:03,793 --> 00:16:06,228
Where were you last night,
Mr. Krill?

00:16:06,295 --> 00:16:07,463
Nowhere.

00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,466
I... I got off work
and went home as usual.

00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:12,601
Do you have a wife or anybody
who can verify that?

00:16:12,668 --> 00:16:14,970
No. I live alone.

00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:19,975
How would you describe your
relationship to Mr. Devereaux?

00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,913
I don't like your tone,
Detective.

00:16:23,979 --> 00:16:25,581
You don't
like my tone?

00:16:25,648 --> 00:16:27,650
One of your coworkers
was just killed.

00:16:27,716 --> 00:16:30,186
You don't seem to be too upset
by it-- why is that?

00:16:34,023 --> 00:16:35,991
I didn't like him.

00:16:36,058 --> 00:16:41,130
Jason was always
trying to get people
to do his work for him.

00:16:41,197 --> 00:16:45,301
And because he was
good-looking and charming,

00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:47,369
I guess they did.

00:16:49,405 --> 00:16:51,841
You do your job...

00:16:51,907 --> 00:16:53,342
and you work hard.

00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:56,345
That's how you get
what you deserve in life.

00:16:56,412 --> 00:16:59,415
At least
that's the way I was raised.

00:17:00,516 --> 00:17:02,384
Hmm.

00:17:23,873 --> 00:17:26,909
Ooh, monoamine
oxidase A.

00:17:26,976 --> 00:17:28,744
Ask me anything.
What do you want to know?

00:17:28,811 --> 00:17:29,912
What do you know about it?

00:17:29,979 --> 00:17:31,080
Kind of a lot.

00:17:31,147 --> 00:17:32,648
My research group
in grad school developed

00:17:32,715 --> 00:17:34,517
a protocol
to synthesize the gene.

00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,185
What's the case?

00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:38,687
It's just something
I'm working on.

00:17:38,754 --> 00:17:41,157
You know, that specific mutation
right there

00:17:41,223 --> 00:17:42,825
has actually been linked
to violent behavior.

00:17:42,892 --> 00:17:44,560
For example,
there was this Dutch family,

00:17:44,627 --> 00:17:45,995
and all the males
in the family

00:17:46,061 --> 00:17:47,997
who had that were rapists
and arsonists.

00:17:48,063 --> 00:17:49,532
And then mice without
the MAOA gene

00:17:49,598 --> 00:17:51,801
all exhibited highly
aggressive behavior.

00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:54,837
MAOA deficiency
doesn't make you violent.

00:17:54,904 --> 00:17:56,071
I didn't say it did.

00:17:56,138 --> 00:17:57,206
Just 'cause something
might happen

00:17:57,273 --> 00:17:58,374
doesn't mean it will.

00:17:58,441 --> 00:18:00,443
It's genetics,
it's not destiny.

00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,314
(blipping, chiming)

00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:09,585
The vic's laptop
is online there.

00:18:09,652 --> 00:18:11,654
That's the victim's
apartment building.

00:18:12,855 --> 00:18:14,657
Can you isolate the unit?

00:18:14,723 --> 00:18:15,724
Let's see.

00:18:21,363 --> 00:18:24,300
His computer was configured
for remote screen access.

00:18:24,366 --> 00:18:30,106
So, that means I might
be able to access
the computer directly.

00:18:30,172 --> 00:18:31,740
Got him.

00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,809
That's what's on his machine
right now.

00:18:35,978 --> 00:18:37,746
This guy's
a gamer, huh?

00:18:37,813 --> 00:18:38,781
Mm-hmm.

00:18:38,848 --> 00:18:40,416
But so am I.

00:18:40,483 --> 00:18:43,152
Check this.
Laptop cam on.

00:18:43,219 --> 00:18:46,021
(computer game
weapons firing)

00:18:52,128 --> 00:18:54,396
Okay...

00:18:54,463 --> 00:18:56,232
Say cheese, dirtbag.

00:18:56,298 --> 00:18:58,968
(camera shutter clicking)

00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:00,536
(nervous chuckle)

00:19:00,603 --> 00:19:02,605
Look, I-I didn't kill nobody,
I don't know nothing

00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:03,706
about nobody
getting killed.

00:19:03,773 --> 00:19:05,574
And here you are
with a dead guy's laptop

00:19:05,641 --> 00:19:09,111
in your possession.
Okay, yeah, sure,
okay, I can admit to that.

00:19:09,178 --> 00:19:10,146
(nervous chuckle)

00:19:10,212 --> 00:19:12,414
I-I was heading
outta my crib

00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:13,649
and I walked by this apartment.

00:19:13,716 --> 00:19:15,151
See, the door was
just wide open.

00:19:15,217 --> 00:19:17,019
All this high-end gear in there,

00:19:17,086 --> 00:19:19,288
it's just sitting there,
unattended.

00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:21,490
Yeah, all locked up
with security cables, right?

00:19:21,557 --> 00:19:23,993
Well, well, yeah, that's why I
go back, get the bolt cutters.

00:19:25,261 --> 00:19:29,331
You know, what with Christmas
coming up and all.

00:19:29,398 --> 00:19:31,400
Yeah.

00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:35,137
Write it down.

00:19:35,204 --> 00:19:37,706
LANGSTON:
He's nothing.

00:19:37,773 --> 00:19:39,675
He's just a random
petty thief.

00:19:39,742 --> 00:19:41,243
The killer probably left
the apartment door open

00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,611
to make it look like a robbery.

00:19:42,678 --> 00:19:45,648
Well, Jason Devereaux
had a juvee record.

00:19:45,714 --> 00:19:46,782
I had it unsealed.

00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:50,052
A lot of antisocial
tendencies in there.

00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,687
He also did time on a work farm

00:19:51,754 --> 00:19:53,222
for peddling Ritalin
in high school.

00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:55,324
You think it's a drug thing?

00:19:55,391 --> 00:19:57,460
His tox came back positive
for methamphetamine.

00:19:57,526 --> 00:20:00,463
Point-oh-two mikes per mil.

00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:02,465
That's a party dose.

00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:03,566
Maybe.

00:20:03,632 --> 00:20:04,867
But it wouldn't be
the first time

00:20:04,934 --> 00:20:07,002
that a regular guy with
a steady job threw it all away

00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:08,871
for the great taste of meth.

00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:23,819
(typing, computer beeps)

00:20:26,455 --> 00:20:28,424
Desi?

00:20:28,491 --> 00:20:30,426
Lucy?

00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:32,428
(chuckles)

00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:35,397
You're doing Desorption
Electrospray Ionization--

00:20:35,464 --> 00:20:38,567
<i>DESI-- a spray of</i>
<i>electrically charged water</i>

00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:40,736
<i>dissolves compounds</i>
<i>in the fingerprints,</i>

00:20:40,803 --> 00:20:43,239
<i>which creates a thin film</i>
<i>that gets scattered back</i>

00:20:43,305 --> 00:20:44,673
<i>to the mass-spec</i>

00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,610
identifying what
the suspect touched.

00:20:47,676 --> 00:20:49,211
I know how it works.

00:20:49,278 --> 00:20:51,380
I'm doing it.
Yes.

00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:54,016
But it was a lucid and
entertaining explanation

00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:57,019
of the process.

00:20:57,086 --> 00:21:00,189
You know, um, I did
process that metal

00:21:00,256 --> 00:21:03,192
and there was no unusual
residue on the surface.

00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:05,961
Are you expecting to find
something in the prints?

00:21:06,028 --> 00:21:09,031
I was at a DEA seminar
last month, uh,

00:21:09,098 --> 00:21:10,466
they were discussing
making "one-pot" meth.

00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:11,634
You mix the chemicals

00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,502
in a container
which you leave in the woods

00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:15,171
to vent and cure.

00:21:15,237 --> 00:21:16,572
But if someone comes along

00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:19,074
and disturbs it at the wrong
moment in the reaction...

00:21:19,141 --> 00:21:20,342
Kaboom.

00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:21,710
So it's a drug thing.

00:21:21,777 --> 00:21:23,112
That's what everyone
seems to think.

00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:25,948
Homeland Security
was missing out

00:21:26,015 --> 00:21:28,384
on a real asset
with Jason Devereaux.

00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:31,153
His laptop was loaded
with keyloggers

00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,290
and corporate spyware set up
to copy e-mails and files

00:21:34,356 --> 00:21:36,325
from a dozen people
in his office.

00:21:36,392 --> 00:21:38,227
There's gigabytes
of stuff here.

00:21:38,294 --> 00:21:40,596
He was spying on
everybody he worked with.

00:21:40,663 --> 00:21:42,598
Maybe he read something
he shouldn't have.

00:21:42,665 --> 00:21:45,601
Something worth
killing him for.

00:21:45,668 --> 00:21:48,437
This isn't
a drug thing.

00:21:48,504 --> 00:21:51,607
Traces of RDX
in the fingerprints--

00:21:51,674 --> 00:21:53,642
high explosive.

00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:55,144
That's disturbing.

00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:56,879
Terrorism comes to mind.

00:21:56,946 --> 00:21:59,548
It certainly does.

00:22:28,444 --> 00:22:31,447
♪ ♪

00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:46,495
I know what you're
up to, Paulie.

00:22:46,562 --> 00:22:48,464
And I want to help.

00:22:48,531 --> 00:22:50,399
What are you talking about?

00:22:57,339 --> 00:23:00,609
What are you doing?

00:23:00,676 --> 00:23:03,679
I haven't been here long, but
I can see the way things are.

00:23:03,746 --> 00:23:07,783
People putting you down,
day after day, in little ways,

00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,618
making you feel
like you're nothing.

00:23:09,685 --> 00:23:11,053
"Hey, Paulie,
you're going to have to

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,721
stay late and do inventory."

00:23:12,788 --> 00:23:16,292
"Hey, Paulie, we're out of
coffee again, would you mind?"

00:23:16,358 --> 00:23:19,395
"Hey, Paulie,
love the shirt."

00:23:19,462 --> 00:23:23,099
I know what it feels like
to be on the outside.

00:23:23,165 --> 00:23:25,568
And I know
you want to make them pay.

00:23:25,634 --> 00:23:28,437
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:23:34,777 --> 00:23:35,744
How did you...

00:23:35,811 --> 00:23:37,513
How did you do that?

00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,748
Your life's an open
book to me, Paulie.

00:23:39,815 --> 00:23:42,618
I know what you really
want to do to this place,

00:23:42,685 --> 00:23:45,521
deep down in your heart,
when it feels like

00:23:45,588 --> 00:23:50,426
Lombard and this job
are grinding you down.

00:23:50,493 --> 00:23:56,031
I've got an uncle that works
in the mining business.

00:23:56,098 --> 00:24:01,537
I could get a brick of RDX
with one phone call.

00:24:01,604 --> 00:24:06,142
No questions asked.

00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:10,412
I can make all your dreams
come true, Paulie.

00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:14,049
All you gotta do is let me.

00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:38,352
Okay, these are
the colleagues whose trust

00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:40,458
Jason Devereaux was violating.

00:24:40,525 --> 00:24:42,427
Knowing the deep,
dark secrets of your coworkers

00:24:42,494 --> 00:24:44,362
is a slippery slope.

00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:48,600
There was a time in my life
that would've come in handy.

00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:51,436
I used to work alongside
an angel of death, remember?

00:24:51,503 --> 00:24:52,937
Hmm.

00:24:53,004 --> 00:24:55,707
It's mostly online shopping
and DVD rentals.

00:24:55,774 --> 00:24:57,642
I take it the office
firewalls porn?

00:24:57,709 --> 00:24:58,943
Don't they all.

00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,378
STOKES:
But if the victim was poking

00:25:00,445 --> 00:25:01,579
into everyone's
private life,

00:25:01,646 --> 00:25:02,814
this could've been
an extortion scheme

00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:04,449
gone bad, a crime of passion.

00:25:04,516 --> 00:25:06,117
Wouldn't explain the
explosives we found

00:25:06,184 --> 00:25:07,185
on the metal fragment.

00:25:07,252 --> 00:25:08,386
SANDERS:
Archie and I did

00:25:08,453 --> 00:25:10,722
global searches for words
like "explosives,"

00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:13,058
and unless Mr. Lombard's

00:25:13,124 --> 00:25:15,226
recent bout of diarrhea
counts, we struck out.

00:25:15,293 --> 00:25:17,128
Brass ran scent dogs
through this whole office.

00:25:17,195 --> 00:25:18,463
The only thing found

00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,832
were traces of RDX
in Jason's cubicle.

00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:23,034
Well, his uncle
runs a mining company

00:25:23,101 --> 00:25:24,903
and according
to Jason's juvee record,

00:25:24,969 --> 00:25:27,672
he enjoyed blowing
things up as a child.

00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:30,175
Maybe he was just pursuing
his hobby into adulthood.

00:25:30,241 --> 00:25:32,310
LANGSTON: Well, if there's
an explanation in there,

00:25:32,377 --> 00:25:34,412
it looks like we're
going to have to find it

00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:36,514
the old-fashioned way
and read the lot of them.

00:25:36,581 --> 00:25:38,149
Split it up by individual,
starting with the day

00:25:38,216 --> 00:25:39,584
of the murder and
work your way back.

00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:41,653
Okay.

00:26:01,673 --> 00:26:03,308
Oh, hey, George.

00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:06,244
Mr. Lombard wanted me
to bring him the new swatches

00:26:06,311 --> 00:26:08,346
Oh, yeah.
for the bellman uniforms.

00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:11,316
Looking for Ms. Mayfield, but...
Yeah, sure, fine, whatever.

00:26:11,383 --> 00:26:13,051
Okay?
Thanks.

00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:16,187
(sports broadcast plays
faintly over earpiece)

00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,692
So, how'd you know this
thing was even in here?

00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:24,562
I found it logging inventory
a few months back,

00:26:24,629 --> 00:26:27,465
so I contacted
the City Planning...

00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:28,967
City Planning Department,
that's right, I remember.

00:26:29,034 --> 00:26:30,135
They, uh, they e-mailed you

00:26:30,201 --> 00:26:33,138
the building plans.
Yeah.

00:26:33,204 --> 00:26:36,007
Okay, coast is clear.

00:26:37,676 --> 00:26:40,111
This was an electrical conduit.

00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:43,381
It goes about 150 feet
outside the building,

00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:45,684
comes up on the other side
of the security fence.

00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,851
Okay.

00:26:46,918 --> 00:26:48,620
Get in.

00:26:48,687 --> 00:26:50,488
What?
Get in.

00:26:50,555 --> 00:26:52,924
Go all the way out
and then come back.

00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:55,460
You said this was
your exit strategy.

00:26:55,527 --> 00:26:56,961
I just want to be sure
that it works.

00:26:57,028 --> 00:26:58,329
Go ahead, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna stand guard.

00:26:58,396 --> 00:27:00,331
Jason, it's totally
dark in there.

00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:01,933
I don't even
have a flashlight.

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,871
Hey, there's an app for that.

00:27:14,612 --> 00:27:16,581
(sneezing, spitting)

00:27:20,985 --> 00:27:23,388
(anxious gasping)

00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:29,194
(rapid breathing)

00:27:31,763 --> 00:27:35,233
(grunting)

00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:48,847
(ringtone blaring,
echoing)

00:27:51,883 --> 00:27:53,885
Hello?

00:27:57,989 --> 00:28:01,059
Okay, okay.

00:28:04,562 --> 00:28:08,566
(ringtone blaring,
echoing)

00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:11,269
GEORGE (in distance):
What are you doing down here?

00:28:11,336 --> 00:28:12,904
JASON: Oh, hey, there, George!
Good to see you again.

00:28:12,971 --> 00:28:14,072
Where's Paulie?

00:28:14,139 --> 00:28:15,573
I'm sorry?
Where's Paulie?

00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,075
You know, I don't know.

00:28:17,142 --> 00:28:18,510
He was just here.

00:28:18,576 --> 00:28:20,478
I'm calling Lombard!
Whoa!

00:28:20,545 --> 00:28:22,213
George, George,
calm down a second!

00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,282
I don't know-- Paulie's
gonna be back in a second.

00:28:24,349 --> 00:28:28,586
Hey, George,
I can explain.

00:28:28,653 --> 00:28:29,921
(laughing)

00:28:29,988 --> 00:28:33,725
That phone has
outstanding reception.

00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:36,628
Wait, that was a joke?

00:28:36,695 --> 00:28:37,962
You were joking?

00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:40,265
Always expect the unexpected.

00:28:40,331 --> 00:28:41,633
Are you kidding me?!

00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,401
Relax, I'm just
toughening you up.

00:28:43,468 --> 00:28:45,036
You're gonna thank me later.

00:28:45,103 --> 00:28:46,638
Did you get all the way out?

00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:48,606
That conduit isn't
going to do us any good

00:28:48,673 --> 00:28:50,775
if you're just counting on
old George to be there...

00:28:50,842 --> 00:28:53,244
(blipping,
lock buzzes and clicks)

00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:55,013
We don't need him.

00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,681
You're not authorized
to be in this...

00:28:56,748 --> 00:28:59,718
How did you,
how did you...?

00:28:59,784 --> 00:29:02,821
Never underestimate the power
of a sexy geek...

00:29:02,887 --> 00:29:04,589
with a Flash drive.

00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:09,828
I got
all the access codes we need.

00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,065
LOMBARD:
Right over here,
Ms. Devereaux.

00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,901
Um...

00:29:16,968 --> 00:29:19,204
they said I could
collect my son's things.

00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,572
Personal effects
only, ma'am.

00:29:20,638 --> 00:29:22,707
And write down
whatever you take.

00:29:30,081 --> 00:29:33,385
Excuse me, are you
Jason's mom?

00:29:33,451 --> 00:29:38,623
I'm Paulie Krill;
my condolences.

00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:41,092
You look like you could
use some help.

00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:44,462
That'd be nice.

00:29:50,535 --> 00:29:53,171
Were you friends with Jase?

00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:55,006
Um, work friends mostly.

00:29:55,073 --> 00:29:57,709
You didn't really
know him then?

00:29:57,776 --> 00:29:59,110
PAULIE:
No, not really.

00:30:08,353 --> 00:30:10,321
I always figured things
would turn out bad for him.

00:30:18,129 --> 00:30:23,935
Jase was a difficult boy.

00:30:24,002 --> 00:30:26,004
High-spirited.

00:30:28,339 --> 00:30:30,809
That's rough when
there's no dad around.

00:30:33,011 --> 00:30:35,814
Sometimes I think I took
extra shifts at work

00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,984
so I wouldn't have to go home.

00:30:54,966 --> 00:30:56,935
Here you go.

00:30:57,001 --> 00:31:01,673
I hope he wasn't
awful to you.

00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,010
Don't blame yourself.

00:31:14,185 --> 00:31:16,187
Ray.

00:31:16,254 --> 00:31:18,456
Highway Patrol just
brought this in.

00:31:18,523 --> 00:31:21,159
They found it on the side of
the road near Mount Charleston,

00:31:21,226 --> 00:31:22,861
about a mile away
from your crime scene.

00:31:22,927 --> 00:31:25,997
Metal's consistent with the
exploded fragment you found.

00:31:26,064 --> 00:31:27,532
And there's blood on the edge.

00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:30,201
Which I sampled
with a high-quality

00:31:30,268 --> 00:31:34,839
Lynn-Peavey integra swab
to compare with the vic's.

00:31:36,574 --> 00:31:40,445
It could be what made the
impact wound on his back.

00:31:40,512 --> 00:31:42,347
It could be our murder weapon.

00:31:42,414 --> 00:31:44,315
Whatever it is.

00:32:08,873 --> 00:32:10,141
Stokes.

00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:11,643
Hey, Nick, it's Wendy.

00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:14,546
I got the DNA results for the
semen stain in the victim's car.

00:32:20,185 --> 00:32:21,319
Hey.

00:32:21,386 --> 00:32:23,521
You okay?

00:32:23,588 --> 00:32:26,958
Yeah. Clearly.

00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:36,368
Thanks.

00:32:36,434 --> 00:32:37,769
You're welcome.

00:32:43,108 --> 00:32:45,443
Belinda, I know
you liked Jason.

00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:49,714
But he was obviously into
some pretty bad stuff.

00:32:49,781 --> 00:32:52,884
Maybe he wasn't as nice
a guy as you think he was.

00:32:52,951 --> 00:32:54,919
They never are.

00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:57,389
Yeah.

00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:01,793
Look, it's about time
to get out of here.

00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,828
You up for a drink?

00:33:03,895 --> 00:33:05,430
(sniffles)

00:33:05,497 --> 00:33:07,565
Or ten?

00:33:07,632 --> 00:33:09,634
Just us?

00:33:10,668 --> 00:33:12,604
Yeah.

00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,439
It's been a weird day.

00:33:14,506 --> 00:33:15,907
What the hell.

00:33:15,974 --> 00:33:17,609
Let's make it a weird night.

00:33:19,644 --> 00:33:21,813
Sure.

00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,616
Ms. Mayfield, I need you
to come to the police station.

00:33:24,683 --> 00:33:26,184
Why?
Do you mind?

00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:28,687
No, he doesn't have...
I already talked with you.

00:33:28,753 --> 00:33:29,888
You didn't talk to me about

00:33:29,954 --> 00:33:31,222
what your DNA was doing
in the victim's car,

00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:34,059
unless you want
to deny sleeping with him.

00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:36,127
Go with this officer.

00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:55,828
You know what
the weird part of this is,

00:33:55,895 --> 00:33:57,730
I mean, at least
from your point of view.

00:33:58,792 --> 00:34:01,227
The only reason we have your DNA
in our system is because

00:34:01,294 --> 00:34:03,196
you gave it to us
three years ago,

00:34:03,263 --> 00:34:04,597
when you filed charges

00:34:04,664 --> 00:34:06,900
against your scumbag ex-husband
for domestic abuse.

00:34:06,966 --> 00:34:08,368
Believe me, I remember that.

00:34:08,435 --> 00:34:09,736
Oh, I'm sure you do.

00:34:09,803 --> 00:34:12,071
And I'm not telling you
something you don't know,

00:34:12,138 --> 00:34:14,808
but you've got a history
of picking the wrong guy.

00:34:14,874 --> 00:34:17,010
I mean, I have statements
from your coworkers.

00:34:17,076 --> 00:34:21,314
Jason Devereaux was banging
half the women in your office.

00:34:21,381 --> 00:34:23,583
So, what do they say
about a woman scorned?

00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,518
SANDERS:
<i>We found Jason's Flash drive</i>

00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:28,988
in her purse, filled with
passwords, account information,

00:34:29,055 --> 00:34:30,557
and RFID access codes

00:34:30,623 --> 00:34:32,692
to nearly every secure area
in that building.

00:34:32,759 --> 00:34:34,994
That screams
white collar crime to me.

00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:36,196
What's the scam?

00:34:36,262 --> 00:34:37,897
I mean, what is
there to steal?

00:34:37,964 --> 00:34:39,365
That place isn't
exactly a bank.

00:34:39,432 --> 00:34:42,702
I don't know, but Jason had
an E-ticket on Pacific Vista

00:34:42,769 --> 00:34:44,170
departing for Cabo
tomorrow morning.

00:34:44,237 --> 00:34:45,338
What?!

00:34:45,405 --> 00:34:46,806
Yeah, so,
unless he just happened

00:34:46,873 --> 00:34:48,007
to be planning a vacation...

00:34:48,074 --> 00:34:50,009
More like trying
to skip town.

00:34:50,076 --> 00:34:53,213
Let's see if anybody else
from his work went with him.

00:34:53,279 --> 00:34:55,582
BRASS:
I hear Cabo's very

00:34:55,648 --> 00:34:56,750
romantic this time of year.

00:34:56,816 --> 00:34:58,551
We were just going away
for the weekend.

00:34:58,618 --> 00:35:00,186
No, you were going away
for good.

00:35:01,821 --> 00:35:04,891
We have your access codes
on Jason's Flash drive.

00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:07,227
I gave him that
so he could reprogram

00:35:07,293 --> 00:35:09,529
my boss' access card,
so it wouldn't work.

00:35:09,596 --> 00:35:10,730
(buzzing)

00:35:10,797 --> 00:35:11,931
Something wrong?

00:35:11,998 --> 00:35:14,134
It was a joke.
BRASS:
It was a plan.

00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,236
You and Jason were cooking up
some scheme in the office,

00:35:16,302 --> 00:35:17,537
things went bad,

00:35:17,604 --> 00:35:19,072
and one working stiff makes
another worker stiff.

00:35:19,139 --> 00:35:20,740
I had a fling with him.

00:35:20,807 --> 00:35:22,475
That was it!

00:35:22,542 --> 00:35:24,310
I didn't kill him.

00:35:24,377 --> 00:35:27,781
The piece that Highway Patrol
brought in is part

00:35:27,847 --> 00:35:32,419
of the inside cover
of a Traeger GR-7 jewelry safe.

00:35:32,485 --> 00:35:33,586
So Jason and
whoever killed him

00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:35,088
were out in the woods
blowing up a safe?

00:35:35,155 --> 00:35:36,256
Apparently.

00:35:36,322 --> 00:35:37,557
All of which suggests

00:35:37,624 --> 00:35:40,727
they were planning
an old-fashioned robbery.

00:35:40,794 --> 00:35:44,297
You know that my dad was
a casino boss, right?

00:35:44,364 --> 00:35:46,166
Well, every few weeks,

00:35:46,232 --> 00:35:48,768
he had to collect the
revenue from all of his

00:35:48,835 --> 00:35:50,904
low-end, low-volume operations.

00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:53,072
Nickel slots from bars
and mini-marts,

00:35:53,139 --> 00:35:55,809
grocery store Keno,
that sort of thing?

00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:57,444
<i>We're not talking</i>
<i>small potatoes, either.</i>

00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:00,880
<i>Quarter mil, easy,</i>
<i>even on a bad month.</i>

00:36:00,947 --> 00:36:03,783
<i>An armored truck would go</i>
<i>around town</i>

00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,385
<i>making the pickups,</i>

00:36:05,452 --> 00:36:08,922
<i>but when they were done,</i>
<i>the bank would be closed.</i>

00:36:08,988 --> 00:36:11,691
<i>So, they would drive</i>
<i>to Sam's business office</i>

00:36:11,758 --> 00:36:13,693
<i>where he kept a big,</i>

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,496
<i>old vault</i>
<i>in a room all by itself.</i>

00:36:16,563 --> 00:36:19,065
<i>Sam loved showing it off to me</i>

00:36:19,132 --> 00:36:23,036
<i>as the sacks of coins and</i>
<i>bricks of cash went into it.</i>

00:36:23,103 --> 00:36:26,072
<i>Anyway, the money would go</i>
<i>into the vault and stay there</i>

00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:27,740
<i>until the next morning,</i>

00:36:27,807 --> 00:36:32,045
<i>when the armored car guys would</i>
<i>return and take it to the bank.</i>

00:36:32,112 --> 00:36:34,114
<i>I think we need to find out</i>

00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,282
<i>if there's a safe</i>
<i>on the premises.</i>

00:36:47,727 --> 00:36:50,096
Oh, hi, there.

00:36:52,198 --> 00:36:53,600
I'm David Hodges.

00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:55,802
Welcome to Lynn-Peavey
Corporation's

00:36:55,869 --> 00:36:57,370
<i>Wonderful World of Forensics.</i>

00:36:57,437 --> 00:37:00,507
Today on our show--
the scintillating

00:37:00,573 --> 00:37:01,641
science of swabbing.

00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:03,143
BRASS (over phone):
I don't think

00:37:03,209 --> 00:37:04,878
the girl
had anything to do with it.

00:37:04,944 --> 00:37:07,547
I think she's more of a victim
than a killer.

00:37:07,614 --> 00:37:08,648
Okay. What about his safe?

00:37:08,715 --> 00:37:10,016
No, not yet.
Tangiers Corporate

00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:11,551
doesn't want
to talk about how and where

00:37:11,618 --> 00:37:13,119
they keep their money
until they get the okay

00:37:13,186 --> 00:37:14,320
from their bosses
in New York,

00:37:14,387 --> 00:37:15,755
and back East,
they're still in bed,

00:37:15,822 --> 00:37:17,190
so I'm working up a warrant.

00:37:17,257 --> 00:37:19,292
Thanks, Jim.
You know how to find me.

00:37:29,636 --> 00:37:31,004
What are you doing?

00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,372
Proof of principle.

00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:34,574
<i>Mythbusters</i> style.

00:37:34,641 --> 00:37:37,710
When you landed on the idea that
there might be a safe involved,

00:37:37,777 --> 00:37:40,680
we had Archie and Greg search
Jason's files for the term.

00:37:40,747 --> 00:37:42,315
It turns out that
both the victim

00:37:42,382 --> 00:37:43,917
and another employee,
Paulie Krill,

00:37:43,983 --> 00:37:46,586
had been doing a lot of Web
searches on safecracking.

00:37:46,653 --> 00:37:48,288
LANGSTON:
That is a Traeger GR-7

00:37:48,354 --> 00:37:50,190
jewelry safe,
same model as the one

00:37:50,256 --> 00:37:52,292
that we found evidence of
in the woods.

00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:53,626
We bought it from
the one local store

00:37:53,693 --> 00:37:54,928
that carries them.

00:37:54,994 --> 00:37:57,464
And the last one they sold was
to Paulie Krill.

00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,532
I take it the fact that
you're both still here means

00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:00,700
there's a broadcast out?

00:38:00,767 --> 00:38:01,634
Yes.

00:38:01,701 --> 00:38:03,703
Paulie Krill is
not at home.

00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:06,272
His office is
closed for the night.

00:38:06,339 --> 00:38:07,707
In any event,

00:38:07,774 --> 00:38:09,909
this safe features what's known
as a glass re-locker.

00:38:09,976 --> 00:38:14,114
<i>When someone attempts</i>
<i>to drill the door,</i>

00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,915
<i>a glass plate</i>
<i>inside the safe breaks,</i>

00:38:15,982 --> 00:38:17,550
<i>activating additional</i>
<i>locking bolts,</i>

00:38:17,617 --> 00:38:19,119
<i>which render the safe</i>

00:38:19,185 --> 00:38:20,620
practically impervious.

00:38:20,687 --> 00:38:22,255
(phone chimes)

00:38:22,322 --> 00:38:26,626
There's a Traeger GR-17 safe
in the vic's office.

00:38:26,693 --> 00:38:28,361
That is the big brother
to this model,

00:38:28,428 --> 00:38:29,662
but the physics is the same.

00:38:29,729 --> 00:38:31,765
These guys were also renting
heist movies,

00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:33,933
among them <i>The Score,</i>
which is not

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,468
a bad film.
I liked it.

00:38:35,535 --> 00:38:37,237
Safecracker cuts a hole
in the top of the safe,

00:38:37,303 --> 00:38:38,505
fills it with water,

00:38:38,571 --> 00:38:40,073
and then drops in
a high explosive depth charge.

00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,941
There was water in
the vic's truck.

00:38:42,008 --> 00:38:43,743
LANGSTON:
And mud at the scene.

00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:45,111
Water is
an incompressible fluid,

00:38:45,178 --> 00:38:47,413
so it transfers the force
of the explosion to the door

00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,416
<i>before the glass re-locker</i>
<i>can activate.</i>

00:38:49,482 --> 00:38:50,817
<i>That was their plan.</i>

00:38:50,884 --> 00:38:52,552
(explosion)

00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,691
That... was... awesome.

00:38:58,758 --> 00:39:00,693
(laughs)

00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,929
Now all we got to do

00:39:02,996 --> 00:39:04,798
is hang loose
for a couple of days

00:39:04,864 --> 00:39:07,667
until the money comes in,
and then we cash out.

00:39:07,734 --> 00:39:08,968
<i>Yo hablo español, mi amigo.</i>

00:39:09,035 --> 00:39:10,136
(laughs)

00:39:10,203 --> 00:39:11,304
I hope you do, too.

00:39:11,371 --> 00:39:12,639
I can't go through with it.

00:39:12,705 --> 00:39:14,040
What?

00:39:14,107 --> 00:39:15,842
No, no, no, no, no.

00:39:15,909 --> 00:39:17,377
No, no, not now.

00:39:17,444 --> 00:39:19,813
No, you are not backing out
of this now, man.

00:39:19,879 --> 00:39:21,014
Not now.
It wasn't real!

00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,215
It was just a game.

00:39:22,282 --> 00:39:23,450
It was... It was a secret.

00:39:23,516 --> 00:39:25,085
Nobody was even supposed
to know about it.

00:39:25,151 --> 00:39:26,286
Hey, hey!

00:39:26,352 --> 00:39:30,190
For 20 years, all you do
is fill in the space

00:39:30,256 --> 00:39:32,225
in that lousy little cubicle,

00:39:32,292 --> 00:39:34,627
and still, you somehow manage

00:39:34,694 --> 00:39:37,530
to come up with
the perfect plan to rip off

00:39:37,597 --> 00:39:39,732
all of the losers
that you work for

00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:42,202
that make you feel
like crap day after day.

00:39:42,268 --> 00:39:45,438
I give you the thing that
you need to make it all go boom,

00:39:45,505 --> 00:39:47,740
and-and you don't want
to go through with it?
No.

00:39:47,807 --> 00:39:49,509
I can't. I can't.

00:39:49,576 --> 00:39:51,211
Yes, you can, Paul.

00:39:51,277 --> 00:39:52,445
For once in your life,

00:39:52,512 --> 00:39:54,013
you're actually going
to do something,

00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,348
something big.

00:39:55,415 --> 00:39:57,217
You want this,
I know you do!

00:39:57,283 --> 00:39:58,952
I've seen it in your eyes.

00:39:59,018 --> 00:40:01,588
Staring at all those things
that you can't get--

00:40:01,654 --> 00:40:05,125
money, respect, Belinda.

00:40:05,191 --> 00:40:06,292
No!

00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:07,660
I don't care!

00:40:07,727 --> 00:40:09,095
I'm not doing it.

00:40:09,162 --> 00:40:10,663
I can't! That's it!

00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:11,998
I am out!

00:40:12,065 --> 00:40:14,100
Fine!

00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:16,035
You want out, you're out!

00:40:16,102 --> 00:40:21,207
I don't need you to carry
this off any more, anyway.

00:40:22,442 --> 00:40:25,678
Breathe a word of this
to anyone anywhere,

00:40:25,745 --> 00:40:28,815
and I will hunt you down and
put a bullet in your head.

00:40:28,882 --> 00:40:30,250
I swear.

00:40:34,821 --> 00:40:37,524
Empty space.

00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:40,160
That's all you are.

00:40:54,174 --> 00:40:55,742
(screaming)

00:41:20,266 --> 00:41:21,434
Mr. Krill!

00:41:21,501 --> 00:41:23,103
LVPD! Open up!

00:41:23,169 --> 00:41:25,171
Paulie, drop it!

00:41:25,238 --> 00:41:26,473
Open this door!

00:41:26,539 --> 00:41:27,774
Open up!

00:41:27,841 --> 00:41:29,943
(beep)

00:41:48,495 --> 00:41:49,596
(banging, shouting)

00:41:49,662 --> 00:41:51,598
Mr. Krill!

00:41:51,664 --> 00:41:55,068
Hey! Don't do it, Paulie!

00:42:01,508 --> 00:42:03,510
(sirens wailing
in distance)

00:42:10,383 --> 00:42:12,385
(sirens approaching)

00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,875
(gasps)

00:42:42,115 --> 00:42:44,451
(banging on door,
indistinct shouting)

00:42:46,252 --> 00:42:48,588
Can't get it open!

00:42:48,655 --> 00:42:50,790
Paulie!

00:42:50,857 --> 00:42:52,792
(pounding on door)
Get the door open!
Let's go!

00:42:52,859 --> 00:42:54,594
GEORGE:
I can't find my card.
Try harder!

00:42:54,661 --> 00:42:56,963
Oh, wait.
I found it.

00:43:02,669 --> 00:43:04,671
(weak panting)

00:43:05,939 --> 00:43:07,774
(groaning)
Call it in.

00:43:07,841 --> 00:43:10,110
(groaning)

00:43:10,176 --> 00:43:11,744
(grunts)
(gasps)

00:43:11,811 --> 00:43:14,247
(panting)
(coughs)

00:43:21,287 --> 00:43:23,223
I knew...

00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:25,425
it would work.
