00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,331
Hmm. And somehow the drunk
manages to survive.

00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:34,836
ECKLIE:
<i>Heard from some uniforms</i>
<i>that you guys</i>

00:13:34,903 --> 00:13:36,705
<i>had a little dust-up</i>
<i>at the scene.</i>

00:13:36,771 --> 00:13:38,640
It was just a spirited debate
among colleagues.

00:13:38,707 --> 00:13:40,141
My team's very passionate
about their work.

00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,277
Yeah, they're also understaffed
and have been for a while,

00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:44,346
which is why I'm adding
another CSI to your shift.

00:13:44,412 --> 00:13:46,047
Ugh, Conrad.

00:13:46,114 --> 00:13:47,415
I don't have time
to train anybody new.

00:13:47,482 --> 00:13:48,917
Don't worry. This one's
been around the block.

00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:50,385
You're going to
get along just fine.

00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,855
ANDREWS:
<i>Richard Wilkes had</i>
<i>a blood alcohol level</i>

00:13:53,922 --> 00:13:56,391
<i>of point one-eight;</i>
<i>he also had GHB</i>

00:13:56,458 --> 00:14:01,162
in his system to the tune
of 60 milligrams per liter.

00:14:01,229 --> 00:14:02,864
Guy obviously
liked to party.

00:14:02,931 --> 00:14:04,232
Copy that.

00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:07,335
Think it's safe to say
his judgment was impaired.

00:14:07,402 --> 00:14:09,671
This could be the culprit.

00:14:09,738 --> 00:14:11,406
Henry...

00:14:11,473 --> 00:14:14,909
find out what that is
for me, please.

00:14:17,412 --> 00:14:18,847
LANGSTON:
According to the SMDs,

00:14:18,913 --> 00:14:23,284
Wilkes traveled 3.2 miles
from his last engine stop.

00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:26,121
Now, how do you drive
that far, that wasted,

00:14:26,187 --> 00:14:27,622
and still stay on the road?

00:14:27,689 --> 00:14:29,824
Individual tolerances vary.

00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:31,493
Just ask Keith Richards.

00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,898
Want to take a
look at this?

00:14:36,965 --> 00:14:38,300
Yes.

00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,618
"Dearest Richard,
thank you for your letter.

00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:58,453
"It was so sweet and so real.

00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,957
Love, always, Olivia."

00:15:05,226 --> 00:15:07,662
This wasn't some random drunk

00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:11,700
accidentally slamming
into a famous actress.

00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:13,501
He was stalking her.

00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,736
The call sheet that we found
in Olivia Hamilton's car

00:15:25,803 --> 00:15:27,471
indicates the time that she was

00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:31,442
due on the movie set,
along with a map from her hotel

00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:33,611
to the location.

00:15:33,677 --> 00:15:35,412
The same information was
on Richard Wilkes' computer.

00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:36,714
We think he hacked

00:15:36,781 --> 00:15:38,549
into the film company's
virtual production office.

00:15:38,616 --> 00:15:41,385
He knew where she was gonna be
and when she was gonna be there.

00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:42,653
In other words, he ambushed her.

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,788
Mm-hmm.
Maybe.

00:15:43,854 --> 00:15:45,356
There are some inconsistencies.

00:15:45,422 --> 00:15:47,258
Like what?

00:15:47,324 --> 00:15:50,027
The duct tape, the rope,
the knife we found--

00:15:50,094 --> 00:15:51,362
all these things suggest that

00:15:51,428 --> 00:15:53,998
Wilkes was thinking to
kidnap Olivia, that he wanted

00:15:54,064 --> 00:15:55,099
to possess her.

00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,267
His crashing his car

00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:59,236
into hers without
wearing a seat belt

00:15:59,303 --> 00:16:01,438
makes it seem like
he was suicidal.

00:16:01,505 --> 00:16:03,340
The man was intoxicated.

00:16:03,407 --> 00:16:04,475
Well, celebrity stalkers

00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:06,877
who kill are driven by

00:16:06,944 --> 00:16:10,214
an overwhelming desire
to achieve fame

00:16:10,281 --> 00:16:12,483
by murdering someone
who's famous.

00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,885
If he killed himself
at the same time as Olivia,

00:16:14,952 --> 00:16:17,388
he would've missed his chance
to bask in the limelight.

00:16:17,455 --> 00:16:19,190
ECKLIE:
All right, look, guys,

00:16:19,256 --> 00:16:20,491
I got a press conference
in an hour,

00:16:20,558 --> 00:16:21,625
and I'd rather not say something

00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:23,694
I'll have to backtrack on
later on.

00:16:23,761 --> 00:16:27,031
Did Wilkes intentionally
kill Olivia Hamilton?

00:16:27,097 --> 00:16:29,300
I'd say so.
I doubt it.

00:16:29,366 --> 00:16:31,702
Maybe you should cancel
the press conference.

00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:34,438
(insistent beeping)

00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:38,843
Well, looks like we got someone
who can clear things up.

00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,582
Richard...

00:16:44,648 --> 00:16:45,883
Hey, Richard.

00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,186
My name is Jim Brass.

00:16:49,253 --> 00:16:50,754
Oh...
I'm a detective.

00:16:50,821 --> 00:16:53,023
Do you know why you're here?

00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:56,594
I killed Olivia.

00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,163
Yeah, you did.

00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,464
How'd that happen?

00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:06,370
We spoke with the people
Olivia works with.

00:17:06,437 --> 00:17:09,273
<i>They said you went by the set</i>
<i>the day before,</i>

00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,508
<i>asking to see her.</i>

00:17:13,911 --> 00:17:16,347
<i>She got you booted off the set.</i>

00:17:17,615 --> 00:17:19,550
<i>So you get mad and...</i>

00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:22,153
you went to an intersection
where you knew she would be.

00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:23,821
She rolls up,
stops at a light.

00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:27,992
"Love always...

00:17:28,058 --> 00:17:29,894
Olivia."

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,896
What?

00:17:31,962 --> 00:17:34,899
Her letter.

00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:37,268
She loved herself.

00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:39,470
Yeah, right.

00:17:43,841 --> 00:17:46,544
STOKES:
This angle is looking
straight down Bridger.

00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,412
Unfortunately,
the crash site itself

00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:51,415
is obscured, but I figured,
you know, see what we can see.

00:17:51,482 --> 00:17:53,017
And where did
this come from?

00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:56,053
A patrolman noticed
a camera on a warehouse

00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,788
about a quarter-mile
from the intersection.

00:17:57,855 --> 00:18:01,692
Okay, this is about
the time the accident
was reported to 911.

00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:02,960
I'll roll it back.

00:18:07,898 --> 00:18:10,167
Dr. Langston, these
just came for you.

00:18:15,473 --> 00:18:17,241
Shooting Review Board?

00:18:17,308 --> 00:18:18,909
Yeah.

00:18:21,278 --> 00:18:22,947
(sighs)

00:18:25,983 --> 00:18:27,551
They cleared me.

00:18:29,553 --> 00:18:31,055
Good.

00:18:31,122 --> 00:18:32,256
Kill or be killed, Ray.

00:18:32,323 --> 00:18:33,991
It's a terrible situation
to be in, man.

00:18:34,058 --> 00:18:35,159
Don't let it bother you.

00:18:35,226 --> 00:18:38,629
It hasn't been bothering me.

00:18:38,696 --> 00:18:41,298
And that's what's been
bothering me.

00:18:47,838 --> 00:18:48,906
LANGSTON:
That's Olivia's car.

00:18:48,973 --> 00:18:50,074
(taps key)

00:18:54,545 --> 00:18:56,113
That's her, all right.

00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,616
I'll roll it forward.

00:18:58,682 --> 00:19:02,219
Now she's approaching the
intersection at Hasbrook.

00:19:02,286 --> 00:19:04,522
Damn, if that camera were
just a couple feet higher,

00:19:04,588 --> 00:19:05,956
we could see
the crash.

00:19:06,023 --> 00:19:07,691
Light turns red,
she stops at the intersection.

00:19:07,758 --> 00:19:09,293
That puts the crash time at

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,528
3:27 a.m.

00:19:10,594 --> 00:19:11,529
Yeah...

00:19:11,595 --> 00:19:14,031
but look at all
the lights on Bridger.

00:19:14,098 --> 00:19:16,333
They're all green,
except for hers.

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,368
So?

00:19:17,434 --> 00:19:18,869
So I know that street
pretty well.

00:19:18,936 --> 00:19:20,104
Those traffic signals
are synced.

00:19:20,171 --> 00:19:21,372
Her light should be green,

00:19:21,438 --> 00:19:23,841
like the rest of them.

00:19:23,908 --> 00:19:25,342
What's the white light

00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:27,678
on the traffic signal?

00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:33,317
That's a confirmation light
for a traffic signal preemption.

00:19:33,384 --> 00:19:36,921
Looks like somebody overrode
the normal timing,

00:19:36,987 --> 00:19:39,056
forcing Olivia's light
to turn red.

00:19:39,123 --> 00:19:42,226
Making her a sitting duck.

00:19:42,293 --> 00:19:45,162
HODGES: Tom O'Neill,
Guardian of the Stars?

00:19:45,229 --> 00:19:46,430
Hey.

00:19:46,497 --> 00:19:47,565
David Hodges.

00:19:47,631 --> 00:19:49,166
Uh, w-we met at Lavo.

00:19:49,233 --> 00:19:50,901
The CineVegas after-party.

00:19:50,968 --> 00:19:53,037
You were parting the seas
for Tarantino.

00:19:53,103 --> 00:19:55,105
Uh...

00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:56,607
Actually, it was, uh,
outside of Lavo.

00:19:56,674 --> 00:19:57,942
I couldn't get past the rope.

00:19:58,008 --> 00:19:59,577
Next time,

00:19:59,643 --> 00:20:01,011
you flash this.

00:20:01,078 --> 00:20:02,780
That'll get you inside.

00:20:02,847 --> 00:20:03,881
Thanks.

00:20:03,948 --> 00:20:05,349
Always glad to help
a brother in blue.

00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,184
Where are we at with Wilkes?

00:20:07,251 --> 00:20:09,520
Oh, uh, yeah, he confessed.

00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:10,821
But we're not sold on it.

00:20:10,888 --> 00:20:12,389
Something just doesn't add up.

00:20:14,091 --> 00:20:16,093
Denny, you okay?

00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:22,533
Hi.
(nervous laugh)

00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,735
Gentlemen.

00:20:24,802 --> 00:20:26,470
They're ready downstairs.

00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,145
WILLOWS:
David.

00:20:34,211 --> 00:20:36,413
Sorry, we are
really backed up.

00:21:10,014 --> 00:21:11,115
STOKES:
<i>The only way</i>

00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:13,517
anybody could change
Olivia's traffic light

00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:16,020
is with
an infrared emitter.

00:21:16,086 --> 00:21:17,721
LVPD and fire department
emitters

00:21:17,788 --> 00:21:19,957
are coded for identification.

00:21:20,024 --> 00:21:21,859
Uncoded emitters
are against the law.

00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:23,661
<i>D.O.T. records confirm</i>

00:21:23,727 --> 00:21:26,831
<i>that at 3:27 a.m., an uncoded</i>

00:21:26,897 --> 00:21:28,399
<i>MIRT infrared emitter</i>
<i>preempted the signal</i>

00:21:28,466 --> 00:21:29,934
<i>at Bridger and Hasbrook.</i>

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,402
(tires screech)

00:21:33,437 --> 00:21:35,906
If Wilkes was using
an illegal emitter,

00:21:35,973 --> 00:21:39,043
why didn't we find it
in his car or at the scene?

00:21:43,614 --> 00:21:45,015
What are you thinking, Ray?

00:21:45,082 --> 00:21:47,918
I'll tell you if I can prove it.

00:21:56,827 --> 00:21:59,463
Are you a reporter?

00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,799
I'm from the crime lab.

00:22:01,866 --> 00:22:04,168
Oh.

00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:08,172
I heard there are a lot
of reporters out there.

00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:10,641
They're all here
to talk to me, you know?

00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,244
Everybody wants
to talk to me now.

00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:17,481
They've even been bothering
the poor nurses.

00:22:17,548 --> 00:22:20,885
I feel so exploited.

00:22:20,951 --> 00:22:23,220
They're not interested
in discovering

00:22:23,287 --> 00:22:25,055
who I really am.

00:22:25,122 --> 00:22:27,792
They just want
to make money off me.

00:22:27,858 --> 00:22:30,261
I watched a segment
on TV la...

00:22:30,327 --> 00:22:31,929
Your O2 sat is very low,
Mr. Wilkes.

00:22:31,996 --> 00:22:34,265
Oh. Oh...

00:22:34,331 --> 00:22:37,434
Now you're in perfectly good
hands. I am a doctor.

00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:42,373
I mean, I <i>was</i> a doctor
until I was forced

00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:43,641
out of my profession.

00:22:43,707 --> 00:22:45,476
It was one of those angel
of death things, you know?

00:22:45,543 --> 00:22:47,711
Huh?
You see, no one really
understood the real me.

00:22:47,778 --> 00:22:50,948
A-And what...?

00:22:51,015 --> 00:22:53,918
Would you close
your eyes for me?

00:22:53,984 --> 00:22:56,754
(laser beeps)
And try to relax.

00:22:56,821 --> 00:22:58,756
Oh, wait a minute.

00:22:58,823 --> 00:23:01,125
Shh. This will be over
in just a moment.

00:23:01,192 --> 00:23:05,396
<i>ALS revealed subcutaneous</i>
<i>bruising on Wilkes' torso.</i>

00:23:05,463 --> 00:23:08,132
STOKES:
Looks like a seat belt injury.

00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:10,100
First responder said
he wasn't wearing a seat belt.

00:23:10,167 --> 00:23:12,536
I know.
Look, the bruising runs

00:23:12,603 --> 00:23:14,638
from his right shoulder
to his left hip.

00:23:14,705 --> 00:23:17,007
That means Wilkes
was in the passenger seat.

00:23:17,074 --> 00:23:18,809
He wasn't
driving the car.

00:23:18,876 --> 00:23:23,013
<i>The real driver crashes into</i>
<i>Olivia Hamilton, killing her.</i>

00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,050
<i>I don't think the crash</i>
<i>broke Wilkes' neck.</i>

00:23:26,117 --> 00:23:27,985
<i>I think the killer moved</i>
<i>a drugged-out Wilkes</i>

00:23:28,052 --> 00:23:31,155
<i>behind the wheel,</i>
then <i>snapped his neck.</i>

00:23:31,222 --> 00:23:32,923
Killer leaves the scene.

00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,293
The headline is,
"Stalker Kills Actress."

00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,096
Which suggests that the killer
knew that Wilkes was a stalker.

00:23:39,163 --> 00:23:40,764
Well, he certainly picked
the right nut job.

00:23:40,831 --> 00:23:42,933
Even though Wilkes survived,
he still confessed to the crime.

00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,135
Can Wilkes corroborate
any of this?

00:23:44,201 --> 00:23:45,503
Oh, he won't.

00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:48,105
He's too happy being
the new Mark David Chapman.

00:23:48,172 --> 00:23:50,541
I really hope you're referring
to Richard Wilkes.

00:23:50,608 --> 00:23:51,509
I wasn't.

00:23:52,843 --> 00:23:55,045
Where'd they get
this from?

00:23:55,112 --> 00:23:56,547
I don't know. You tell me.

00:23:56,614 --> 00:23:58,182
I don't know.

00:23:58,249 --> 00:23:59,250
It's your job to know,
Catherine.

00:23:59,316 --> 00:24:00,818
Nobody in this lab
should be talking

00:24:00,885 --> 00:24:03,320
to anybody in the media
about an open investigation,

00:24:03,387 --> 00:24:05,990
let alone one
of this profile.

00:24:06,056 --> 00:24:07,057
Hey, take it easy,
Ecklie.

00:24:07,124 --> 00:24:08,058
I'm sure she's not the leak.

00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:09,460
I can defend myself.

00:24:09,527 --> 00:24:10,761
This is a discipline problem,
Catherine.

00:24:10,828 --> 00:24:12,229
Just get a grip on your people.

00:24:12,296 --> 00:24:14,031
I'm beginning to think
Riley was right about you.

00:24:14,098 --> 00:24:15,733
What is that supposed
to mean?

00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,034
You didn't read
her exit interview.

00:24:17,101 --> 00:24:18,636
I put it on your desk.

00:24:18,702 --> 00:24:20,538
What?
Just read it.

00:24:20,604 --> 00:24:22,573
Uh, hi, guys.

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,208
This a bad time?

00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:29,290
LANGSTON:
Nice to meet you,

00:24:29,357 --> 00:24:30,925
and I look forward
to working with you.

00:24:30,992 --> 00:24:32,160
Thanks. Me, too.

00:24:32,226 --> 00:24:33,561
STOKES:
I'll see you
later, yeah?
Yeah.

00:24:33,628 --> 00:24:35,530
So let's grab a bite
after the shift.
Okay.

00:24:35,596 --> 00:24:36,764
Sara!

00:24:39,133 --> 00:24:41,736
What are you doing here?

00:24:41,802 --> 00:24:46,107
You tired of being
happy and married?

00:24:46,174 --> 00:24:48,576
No, Grissom is guest-lecturing
at the Sorbonne

00:24:48,643 --> 00:24:51,312
while we're waiting for our
research grant to get funded,

00:24:51,379 --> 00:24:53,614
and Ecklie called;
he said the team was down a man

00:24:53,681 --> 00:24:55,449
and he wondered if I could
recommend anyone.

00:24:55,516 --> 00:24:57,585
And you know,
as much as I love Paris,

00:24:57,652 --> 00:24:59,687
and my French is
actually pretty good right now,

00:24:59,754 --> 00:25:01,923
I realized I miss you guys.

00:25:01,989 --> 00:25:05,126
Well, we miss you, too.

00:25:05,193 --> 00:25:07,962
So, uh, how's the world
treating you?

00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:10,665
Oh, you know, still being
treated like the lab tech

00:25:10,731 --> 00:25:12,633
with the crazy hair.

00:25:45,933 --> 00:25:48,069
(sighs)

00:25:48,135 --> 00:25:49,170
(man clears throat)

00:25:50,838 --> 00:25:54,876
It has ten percent of the FDA's
daily requirement for vitamin C.

00:25:54,942 --> 00:25:58,012
If you don't have
your health,

00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,113
you don't have anything.

00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,315
Hodges, who did you blab to?

00:26:01,382 --> 00:26:03,351
Nobody in the media,
(scoffs)

00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:06,554
but I did mention something
to Tom O'Neill.

00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:10,558
But only in passing
and implicitly in confidence.

00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:14,595
I would point out that I had
not been explicitly forbidden

00:26:14,662 --> 00:26:16,297
from discussing
the case

00:26:16,364 --> 00:26:17,698
with law enforcement community.

00:26:17,765 --> 00:26:21,102
Uh, memo from my supervisor
to that effect

00:26:21,169 --> 00:26:23,004
would have been helpful,

00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,472
not that I'm
blaming you.

00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,875
Don't ever do anything
like that ever again.

00:26:27,942 --> 00:26:30,144
Thank you.

00:26:46,527 --> 00:26:49,163
STOKES:
<i>I know Richard Wilkes</i>
<i>stayed here. You remember him?</i>

00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,633
Uh, you know, I guess
I recognize him.

00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,503
You know, he looks like
a lot of guys that stay here.

00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,138
Sir, please, it's important.
Think a little bit harder.

00:26:57,205 --> 00:26:58,773
Are you sure you didn't see him
with anybody else?

00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,175
No. All I can say for sure
is that he checked out

00:27:01,242 --> 00:27:03,344
two nights ago around
midnight. Paid cash.

00:27:03,411 --> 00:27:05,746
All right, thanks.
Sure.

00:27:07,181 --> 00:27:08,449
Hey.

00:27:08,516 --> 00:27:11,686
Eye-in-the-sky guys delivered
some surveillance video.

00:27:11,752 --> 00:27:13,788
Good. 'Cause the manager
confirmed Wilkes stayed here,

00:27:13,855 --> 00:27:16,591
but that's about it.

00:27:16,657 --> 00:27:19,393
Hey, looks like he managed
to make himself a friend.

00:27:26,901 --> 00:27:29,103
STOKES:
Is that...?

00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:30,538
That's Tom O'Neill.

00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:32,340
Talking to Olivia Hamilton's
stalker

00:27:32,406 --> 00:27:35,510
a little over three hours
before she died.

00:27:35,576 --> 00:27:36,711
It's funny
he didn't manage

00:27:36,777 --> 00:27:37,912
to mention that
to anybody.

00:27:37,979 --> 00:27:40,515
STOKES:
Little lie, big lie.

00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:42,884
What if O'Neill
was the driver?

00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,218
If O'Neill was driving,

00:27:44,285 --> 00:27:46,154
then how come he didn't get
so much as a scratch

00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,222
from the airbag opening up
in his face?

00:27:54,795 --> 00:27:56,497
BRASS:
Well, rolling the dice.

00:27:56,564 --> 00:27:59,734
That's a, that's
a different way to grieve.

00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,569
He has the right to grieve
any way he wants.

00:28:01,636 --> 00:28:02,737
Now if there's
any more questions...

00:28:02,803 --> 00:28:04,906
Actually,
I have questions for you.

00:28:04,972 --> 00:28:06,941
Sure, no problem.

00:28:07,008 --> 00:28:09,477
Hang in there, kid.

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,316
Did you know
that Olivia was pregnant?

00:28:15,383 --> 00:28:17,285
Yes.

00:28:17,351 --> 00:28:18,386
You didn't mention that before.

00:28:18,452 --> 00:28:20,621
It's none of your business.

00:28:20,688 --> 00:28:22,757
We spoke to Olivia's
production office,

00:28:22,824 --> 00:28:24,559
and they told us
that you would ride

00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:26,394
to the set with her
nearly every morning.

00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,929
Why not that morning?

00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:34,335
I wish I had.

00:28:36,504 --> 00:28:38,773
I was gonna give her this.

00:28:47,248 --> 00:28:50,685
(trilling)

00:28:53,821 --> 00:28:55,556
(beeping)

00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,636
<i>When I heard about the incident</i>
<i>on Olivia's set,</i>

00:29:08,703 --> 00:29:10,271
I put a tail on Wilkes.

00:29:10,338 --> 00:29:11,839
I found where
he was staying.

00:29:11,906 --> 00:29:13,007
Olivia Hamilton
wasn't your client.

00:29:13,074 --> 00:29:15,276
A threat to her
was a threat to Denny.

00:29:15,343 --> 00:29:17,478
So I went and had a little chat
with Wilkes.

00:29:17,545 --> 00:29:19,714
If you don't leave
Olivia Hamilton alone,

00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,949
I'm gonna go
to that aerospace plant

00:29:22,016 --> 00:29:26,220
where you polish the floors
and I'm gonna show Mr. Segal.

00:29:26,287 --> 00:29:29,557
That's right.
I know your boss's name.

00:29:29,624 --> 00:29:33,127
I'll show Mr. Segal my card,
and I'll tell him to fire you.

00:29:33,194 --> 00:29:34,996
He'll ask me why.

00:29:35,062 --> 00:29:38,799
And I'll say because you're
a stalker and a psycho.

00:29:38,866 --> 00:29:41,002
And then he'll fire you.

00:29:41,068 --> 00:29:42,603
Then I'll go to my cop friends,

00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,505
and I'll get
a restraining order.

00:29:44,572 --> 00:29:45,873
And when you violate it--

00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,942
because sooner or later
you will--

00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:50,811
I'm gonna throw your ass
in jail.

00:29:50,878 --> 00:29:52,480
I impressed him
with my sincerity,

00:29:52,547 --> 00:29:53,915
and he agreed to leave town.

00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:55,750
I walked him back
to his room.

00:29:55,816 --> 00:29:56,884
I helped him pack,

00:29:56,951 --> 00:29:58,820
and I put him in his car

00:29:58,886 --> 00:30:00,822
and I followed him 
to the I-15 on-ramp.

00:30:00,888 --> 00:30:03,224
Watched him get back
on the road to L.A.

00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:04,659
Apparently not for long.

00:30:04,725 --> 00:30:05,760
You can understand

00:30:05,827 --> 00:30:07,328
why I didn't tell you
all this before.

00:30:07,395 --> 00:30:08,396
No, I understand.

00:30:08,462 --> 00:30:10,231
You lean on a guy,
the guy flips out,

00:30:10,298 --> 00:30:11,332
kills your client's girlfriend.

00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:12,500
That can't look good
on your resumé.

00:30:12,567 --> 00:30:14,502
I-I couldn't afford the hit.

00:30:14,569 --> 00:30:15,937
I got six hungry bookies
to feed.

00:30:16,003 --> 00:30:17,371
Oh, yeah, sure.

00:30:17,438 --> 00:30:18,873
Hey...

00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,675
what's in the bag?

00:30:20,741 --> 00:30:23,544
Workout stuff.
I was at the gym.

00:30:23,611 --> 00:30:25,112
11:30 at night?

00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:27,281
Crazy hours I pull,

00:30:27,348 --> 00:30:29,784
you grab a little cardio
whenever you can.

00:30:29,851 --> 00:30:31,819
Well, let's just see
if that's true.

00:30:33,521 --> 00:30:36,090
I assume you had a warrant
for that?

00:30:36,157 --> 00:30:38,192
Oh, sure, we're professionals.

00:30:38,259 --> 00:30:40,094
Mr. O'Neill,
I have to say

00:30:40,161 --> 00:30:43,097
that your hotel suite
was very impressive.

00:30:43,164 --> 00:30:47,068
The Ocampo family
clearly values your services.

00:30:47,134 --> 00:30:49,170
Now why are you carrying around
this helmet?

00:30:49,237 --> 00:30:52,673
I use that for a tactical
driving course I teach.

00:30:54,742 --> 00:30:57,745
And can you tell me what
that white powdery substance is?

00:30:57,812 --> 00:30:59,647
Uh-uh.

00:30:59,714 --> 00:31:02,149
We are testing it, of course.

00:31:02,216 --> 00:31:04,152
Here's my prediction.

00:31:04,218 --> 00:31:05,820
It's airbag dust.

00:31:05,887 --> 00:31:07,321
Tactical driving,
you bump into things.

00:31:07,388 --> 00:31:08,689
Airbags go off.

00:31:08,756 --> 00:31:11,192
They also go off when you ram
a young woman's car

00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:13,094
and crush her
to death.

00:31:13,161 --> 00:31:14,896
Now, maybe Denny loved Olivia.
I don't know.

00:31:14,962 --> 00:31:17,532
But I bet
his father in Macao didn't.

00:31:17,598 --> 00:31:19,367
Not with Denny's record.

00:31:19,433 --> 00:31:20,668
Another pregnant bimbo,

00:31:20,735 --> 00:31:23,671
another multimillion-dollar
settlement.

00:31:23,738 --> 00:31:27,041
Mr. Ocampo, who pays your
salary, who finances your...

00:31:27,108 --> 00:31:28,276
Flamboyant.

00:31:28,342 --> 00:31:31,145
...lifestyle,
I think he asked you

00:31:31,212 --> 00:31:33,347
to find a more
cost-effective way

00:31:33,414 --> 00:31:36,551
of dealing with the situation,
and so you did.

00:31:48,629 --> 00:31:51,666
Too bad for you
Wilkes already confessed.

00:31:56,537 --> 00:31:59,207
I want a lawyer.

00:32:00,441 --> 00:32:02,510
LANGSTON:
<i>Hodges confirmed</i>

00:32:02,577 --> 00:32:04,178
<i>that the dust we found</i>
<i>in the helmet</i>

00:32:04,245 --> 00:32:05,746
was airbag talc.

00:32:05,813 --> 00:32:09,917
Which only puts O'Neill in half
of all cars with airbags.

00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,918
He's guilty, Catherine.

00:32:10,985 --> 00:32:12,553
Okay, how are we
gonna prove it?

00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,489
I don't know yet,
but we will.

00:32:16,224 --> 00:32:17,425
I like his attitude.

00:32:17,492 --> 00:32:19,560
Reminds you of you?

00:32:19,627 --> 00:32:21,929
I checked companies
that sell Murray emitters

00:32:21,996 --> 00:32:24,065
against O'Neill's
credit card statements.

00:32:24,131 --> 00:32:26,033
No joy. He could
have his own emitter.

00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,402
The old ones aren't coded.

00:32:28,469 --> 00:32:30,872
So what's next?

00:32:30,938 --> 00:32:32,673
(sighs)

00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,811
Sara, I know that you walked
into some fireworks

00:32:36,878 --> 00:32:38,279
in the break room.

00:32:38,346 --> 00:32:43,017
What, Ecklie? Please.

00:32:43,084 --> 00:32:45,920
No, I just read
Riley's exit interview.

00:32:45,987 --> 00:32:51,459
She had some harsh things
to say about my leadership;

00:32:51,526 --> 00:32:54,061
that the team's
fractured;

00:32:54,128 --> 00:32:58,065
that it lacks cohesion
because of me

00:32:58,132 --> 00:33:00,201
because of my
managerial style.

00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,805
I don't know. I-I admit it.

00:33:04,872 --> 00:33:09,076
I admit that things are
different since Grissom left.

00:33:09,143 --> 00:33:13,214
Well... it's like...

00:33:13,281 --> 00:33:16,184
when a great baseball team
loses its clean-up hitter,

00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,419
suddenly everybody's
swinging for the fences

00:33:18,486 --> 00:33:19,854
and nobody's playing small ball.

00:33:19,921 --> 00:33:23,457
You're using a baseball analogy.

00:33:23,524 --> 00:33:26,460
Apparently,
part of being married

00:33:26,527 --> 00:33:29,463
is attempting to share
in your spouse's interests.

00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,898
(chuckles)

00:33:30,965 --> 00:33:34,735
Okay.
That's a weird side of you.

00:33:34,802 --> 00:33:36,404
I know.

00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:39,607
Look, you still have
a lot of great players

00:33:39,674 --> 00:33:41,375
<i>and</i> some new talent.

00:33:41,442 --> 00:33:44,278
Maybe you just need
to reshuffle your lineup.

00:33:44,345 --> 00:33:46,981
English, please.

00:33:47,048 --> 00:33:49,817
You are a great CSI, Catherine,

00:33:49,884 --> 00:33:51,686
and you know
how to manage your team.

00:33:52,820 --> 00:34:00,127
The only thing Grissom had
that you don't...

00:34:01,662 --> 00:34:03,164
is you.

00:34:12,206 --> 00:34:14,308
Oh, God.

00:34:19,447 --> 00:34:21,082
Hey, who are you?

00:34:21,148 --> 00:34:22,984
Hello? Excuse me, excuse me.

00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,920
Hey, hey, stop!

00:34:25,987 --> 00:34:29,157
What the hell
is going on here?!

00:34:29,223 --> 00:34:33,928
(speaking Russian)

00:34:38,733 --> 00:34:40,401
Security!

00:34:48,242 --> 00:34:50,878
(yelling indistinctly)

00:34:58,786 --> 00:35:00,421
(gunfire)

00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,845
You okay?
Are you okay?

00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:31,845
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:35:31,911 --> 00:35:33,480
On your feet!

00:35:37,584 --> 00:35:39,119
Settle down!

00:35:55,869 --> 00:35:57,971
The doctor said both of
our people are stable.

00:35:58,038 --> 00:35:59,906
SIDLE:
Good.

00:35:59,973 --> 00:36:03,143
Okay, I got the van's plate
number out on broadcast

00:36:03,209 --> 00:36:04,411
and Ecklie's handling the press.

00:36:04,477 --> 00:36:05,979
Any idea who they were?

00:36:06,046 --> 00:36:09,049
Well, they're not morticians,
no matter what their IDs say,

00:36:09,115 --> 00:36:10,216
and these...

00:36:10,283 --> 00:36:12,419
are Russian mob tattoos.

00:36:12,485 --> 00:36:14,654
BRASS:
Which means we're going to get
a lot more out of him

00:36:14,721 --> 00:36:16,756
than we will out
of any of the survivors.

00:36:16,823 --> 00:36:18,258
The IDs looked legit

00:36:18,324 --> 00:36:20,293
so the security guard let them
in through the loading dock.

00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,461
They snatched the body.

00:36:21,528 --> 00:36:23,997
When they tried to leave
the same way they came in,

00:36:24,064 --> 00:36:26,199
they found the doors blocked
by a double-parked truck.

00:36:26,266 --> 00:36:28,268
So they found
another way out, okay.

00:36:28,334 --> 00:36:30,904
But why risk breaking
into a lab filled with cops

00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,138
to steal Olivia Hamilton's body?

00:36:32,205 --> 00:36:35,408
They didn't take
Olivia Hamilton.

00:36:35,475 --> 00:36:37,043
They took my bum?

00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,778
But we don't even
know who he is.

00:36:38,845 --> 00:36:40,246
Well, clearly they do.

00:36:40,313 --> 00:36:42,248
Hey, guys, you're not
going to believe this.

00:36:42,315 --> 00:36:43,750
The DNA from
your John Doe

00:36:43,817 --> 00:36:46,486
just came back with a parental
match to an open case.

00:36:46,553 --> 00:36:49,022
That bum is
Olivia Hamilton's father.

00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:53,259
DISPATCH:
All units be advised,

00:36:53,326 --> 00:36:55,061
suspect vehicle
in the lab break-in

00:36:55,128 --> 00:36:56,796
was recovered on Westcroft Drive

00:36:56,863 --> 00:36:58,631
at mile marker 214,
Mount Charleston.

00:36:58,698 --> 00:36:59,866
Hey.
Hey.

00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:04,270
Oh, no.

00:37:04,337 --> 00:37:06,406
This doesn't look good.

00:37:06,473 --> 00:37:11,111
(flies buzzing)

00:37:11,177 --> 00:37:14,180
STOKES: Well, so much
for Olivia Hamilton's father.

00:37:14,247 --> 00:37:15,682
Ugh.

00:37:15,749 --> 00:37:17,517
It might not be him.

00:37:19,919 --> 00:37:22,322
SIDLE:
Mmm. (coughs, clears throat)

00:37:30,463 --> 00:37:33,066
You, uh, care to rethink that?

00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:36,970
SANDERS:
<i>According to James Hamilton's</i>
<i>medical records,</i>

00:37:37,037 --> 00:37:41,374
he was a diagnosed schizophrenic
prone to violent outbursts.

00:37:41,441 --> 00:37:44,277
Olivia Hamilton
was his only child,

00:37:44,344 --> 00:37:46,846
and she did the best she could
taking care of him,

00:37:46,913 --> 00:37:48,915
but he was in and out
of institutions

00:37:48,982 --> 00:37:51,885
and on and off the streets
for years.

00:37:51,951 --> 00:37:53,553
Now from what I can tell,

00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,655
their relationship
was never made public.

00:37:55,722 --> 00:37:58,091
It's a minor miracle she was
able to keep it out of the tabs.

00:37:58,158 --> 00:38:01,327
That might have been
about to change.

00:38:01,394 --> 00:38:03,430
We found these shots
on O'Neill's camera.

00:38:03,496 --> 00:38:05,732
Recovered JPEGs
from the SD card.

00:38:05,799 --> 00:38:07,701
They were taken
in front of the weekly

00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:09,302
where James Hamilton
was living

00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:11,871
two days before
Olivia Hamilton's death.

00:38:11,938 --> 00:38:14,240
We got O'Neill's financials.

00:38:14,307 --> 00:38:17,644
Like we figured, Denny's father,
Mr. Moneybags from Macau,

00:38:17,711 --> 00:38:19,112
pays his salary.

00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:21,247
One week ago,
O'Neill receives

00:38:21,314 --> 00:38:24,217
an unusually large deposit--
a hundred grand--

00:38:24,284 --> 00:38:26,920
wired from an Asian bank.

00:38:26,986 --> 00:38:29,923
Maybe paying him to break up
Denny's latest romance.

00:38:29,989 --> 00:38:32,659
O'Neill shadows Olivia,
trying to dig up some dirt.

00:38:32,726 --> 00:38:34,094
Follows her to the weekly

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,097
where she meets up with
this very strange old man.

00:38:37,163 --> 00:38:39,065
He could be a drug dealer.
Who knows?

00:38:39,132 --> 00:38:41,868
But it looks like the perfect
material to incite a break-up.

00:38:41,935 --> 00:38:43,803
So he takes a couple shots
of them.

00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,171
But he's curious.

00:38:45,238 --> 00:38:47,574
So he goes to the room
to talk to the guy

00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,908
and see what the story is.

00:38:48,975 --> 00:38:50,243
<i>Hamilton freaks out.</i>

00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:53,480
<i>They fight and O'Neill</i>
<i>ends up killing him.</i>

00:38:53,546 --> 00:38:56,182
Now O'Neill's a murderer--
under stress.

00:38:56,249 --> 00:38:58,184
And a delusional stalker

00:38:58,251 --> 00:39:00,987
provides him
with the perfect way

00:39:01,054 --> 00:39:04,624
to get Olivia out
of Denny's life permanently.

00:39:04,691 --> 00:39:06,760
It's reasonable.

00:39:06,826 --> 00:39:08,328
But it's just speculation.

00:39:08,395 --> 00:39:10,163
We can't nail O'Neill
for either death.

00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:13,233
The only reason O'Neill
would risk stealing the body

00:39:13,299 --> 00:39:16,302
is if he believed
it could somehow implicate him,

00:39:16,369 --> 00:39:19,506
which means there has to be
evidence on the body

00:39:19,572 --> 00:39:21,808
or <i>in</i> the body.

00:39:55,342 --> 00:39:56,676
(sighs)

00:39:56,743 --> 00:39:58,111
(sniffs)

00:39:58,178 --> 00:40:00,347
Ugh.

00:40:00,413 --> 00:40:02,148
Oh.

00:40:03,049 --> 00:40:04,417
(chuckles)

00:40:07,687 --> 00:40:10,256
James Hamilton swallowed
something

00:40:10,323 --> 00:40:12,525
when O'Neill beat him
to death.

00:40:12,592 --> 00:40:16,429
<i>Greg found clothing fibers</i>
<i>in his teeth.</i>

00:40:18,932 --> 00:40:20,834
We're looking for this cufflink.

00:40:23,169 --> 00:40:24,571
If O'Neill knew
what happened,

00:40:24,637 --> 00:40:26,973
why not take the body
right then and there?

00:40:28,942 --> 00:40:31,845
WILLOWS:
<i>He didn't know,</i>

00:40:31,911 --> 00:40:36,316
<i>not until he came here</i>
<i>and saw James Hamilton's body.</i>

00:40:41,788 --> 00:40:45,258
STOKES:
We've been separating
metals and inorganics.

00:40:45,325 --> 00:40:47,494
So... Here, this may be it.

00:41:00,907 --> 00:41:03,209
We got him.

00:41:05,478 --> 00:41:07,480
WOMAN:
Las Vegas Police have arrested
Tom O'Neill,

00:41:07,547 --> 00:41:10,784
a bodyguard
often seen protecting

00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,086
the biggest celebrities,

00:41:13,153 --> 00:41:14,721
including Denny Ocampo.

00:41:14,788 --> 00:41:16,189
Funny thing is,
the father's death

00:41:16,256 --> 00:41:17,857
was probably an accident.

00:41:17,924 --> 00:41:20,293
But Olivia was
premeditated.

00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,696
Irritates me that we weren't
able to get him for that.

00:41:22,762 --> 00:41:24,197
But you know what?
We know what he did

00:41:24,264 --> 00:41:26,232
and so does he,
and he can spend

00:41:26,299 --> 00:41:27,434
the next 20 years
of his life

00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,668
dreaming of his
perfect crime.

00:41:28,735 --> 00:41:33,840
Think of it like busting
Al Capone for tax evasion.

00:41:35,442 --> 00:41:37,944
(cricket chirping)

00:41:42,349 --> 00:41:44,684
How did you now he was
going to be hungry?

00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:46,152
It doesn't
really matter.

00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:47,821
They go after crickets
no matter what.

00:41:47,887 --> 00:41:50,924
I think the chirping
annoys them.

00:41:58,765 --> 00:42:01,234
That's not my spider, dude.

00:42:01,301 --> 00:42:03,536
Seriously?

00:42:03,603 --> 00:42:05,438
Seriously.

00:42:05,505 --> 00:42:07,574
Is that...?

00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,542
Little Stevie?

00:42:09,609 --> 00:42:12,746
Oh, he's been missing for years.

00:42:12,812 --> 00:42:15,515
I'll have to let Sara know
so she can tell her...

00:42:15,582 --> 00:42:18,184
husband.
Husband.

00:42:18,251 --> 00:42:20,453
WILLOWS:
Hey, Nicky.
Yeah.

00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,655
You got a sec?
Yeah.

00:42:25,425 --> 00:42:27,761
What's up?

00:42:27,827 --> 00:42:30,530
Oh, something
that's long overdue.

00:42:30,597 --> 00:42:32,832
I don't tell you enough, Nicky,

00:42:32,899 --> 00:42:36,302
but I couldn't do this job
without you.

00:42:37,337 --> 00:42:40,173
Okay.

00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,242
Love you too, Catherine.

00:42:42,308 --> 00:42:45,512
I am promoting you.

00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:51,885
You are now assistant
supervisor on grave.

00:42:51,951 --> 00:42:54,821
All right. Thanks.

00:42:54,888 --> 00:42:57,757
Please have these FI reviews
on my desk

00:42:57,824 --> 00:42:59,926
by tomorrow night.

00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,903
What's up, Doc?

00:43:09,969 --> 00:43:13,139
Well, just business as usual,
I'm delighted to say.

00:43:13,206 --> 00:43:17,077
This gentleman has been in
the cooler for a couple days.

00:43:17,143 --> 00:43:18,478
Joseph Bigelow.

00:43:18,545 --> 00:43:20,080
No known address.

00:43:20,146 --> 00:43:22,949
Apparently, spent most of his
time downtown in the streets.

00:43:23,016 --> 00:43:25,752
No signs of trauma.

00:43:25,819 --> 00:43:29,222
My guess is his ticker probably
decided to call it quits.

00:43:30,657 --> 00:43:33,026
Whoa.

00:43:39,899 --> 00:43:42,635
What the hell is that?

00:43:42,702 --> 00:43:44,838
I was hoping
you'd tell me.
