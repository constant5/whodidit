So, the guy says
it was an accident.

00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,345
That he didn't mean
to kill his wife.

00:02:16,412 --> 00:02:18,481
The golf ball
just hit her in the head.

00:02:18,547 --> 00:02:22,218
So the detective says,
"Well, the coroner also found

00:02:22,284 --> 00:02:25,821
a golf ball
lodged up against her rectum."

00:02:25,888 --> 00:02:27,723

00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,625
"Yeah, that was
my mulligan."

Maybe a nine millimeter
or a .38.

00:02:43,138 --> 00:02:45,908
And no exit wound.

00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:47,643
The blood's reddish brown.

00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,979
Deoxygenated.
That's right.

00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,680
Bullet hit his jugular.

00:02:51,747 --> 00:02:53,215
He's in full rigor.

00:02:53,282 --> 00:02:55,484
T.O.D.'s ten to 12 hours ago.

00:02:58,154 --> 00:02:59,889
Uh...

00:02:59,955 --> 00:03:02,892
he was dead before my ball
got there, wasn't he?

00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:05,561
Well, so far,
it seems that way.

00:03:05,628 --> 00:03:07,396

Sorry, Cath, no I.D.

00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:15,471
Oh, the club
official told me

00:03:15,538 --> 00:03:16,872
that his name
is Russell Huntley.

00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:19,341
He's a member,
so he's out here often.

00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,010
Apparently he used
to be a pro.

00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:24,213
This is his own
personal cart.

00:03:25,499 --> 00:03:28,135
This club head cover's
saturated in blood.

00:03:28,201 --> 00:03:29,291
The victim probably grabbed

00:03:29,358 --> 00:03:30,959
whatever was
within his reach,

00:03:31,026 --> 00:03:33,128
and tried to staunch
the bleeding.

00:03:33,195 --> 00:03:36,732
<i>But this soft, porous fabric</i>

00:03:36,798 --> 00:03:39,301
<i>probably acted</i>
<i>more like a sponge.</i>

00:03:39,368 --> 00:03:42,371
So we've got a club head cover,
but no clubs.

00:03:42,437 --> 00:03:44,806

The golf cart tracks end

00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:21,879

practically anywhere

he's got a four and a half

00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:53,937
But this is the only part

00:05:54,004 --> 00:05:56,072

00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:08,284

He's Russell's son.

00:06:09,853 --> 00:06:13,089
But with your last name.
That's curious.

00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:14,691
It was his decision.

00:06:14,758 --> 00:06:16,893
I raised him.
Oh.

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,095

you saw Russell?

Here's to Danny Nagano,
the new course record holder.

00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:34,377
Enjoy the night, kid,

00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:36,780
because tomorrow I'm gonna
be gunning for you.

00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:39,049
Are you going to stand
for that, Danny?

00:06:39,115 --> 00:06:40,450
Danny?

00:06:40,517 --> 00:06:41,518
It's one round.

00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:42,919
You didn't win
the tournament.

00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,954
No, you shot
one round.
What's the matter?

00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:46,056
Can't you stand the fact

00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:47,724
that your son beat
your old record, huh?

00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,959
Don't take that
tone with me.
No. You go home.

00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:51,294
You are drunk.

00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:53,463
Go home before you embarrass
yourself any more than you have.

00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,800
Hey, try to remember what
this game is really about.
Go.

00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:58,468
Don't worry.
Shake it off.

00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:02,605
If you'll excuse me,

00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,841
I have funeral
arrangements to make.

00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:08,011
I understand.
Thank you.

00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:36,940
PHILLIPS:
I couldn't find the bullet,

00:07:37,007 --> 00:07:39,743
and with no exit wound,
I don't think he was shot.

00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:42,212
Take a look.

00:07:42,278 --> 00:07:44,314
Well, if that's the case,

00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,984
this wound might indicate
sharp-force trauma.

00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:56,393
There's a fragment of something.

00:07:58,862 --> 00:08:00,930
Black plastic maybe?

00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:04,534
With something else
embedded in it?

00:08:07,937 --> 00:08:09,939
Huh.

00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:15,412
Got a sportsbook ticket
from the Eclipse.

00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:17,247
Thank you.

00:08:17,313 --> 00:08:18,381
If he picked a winner,

00:08:18,448 --> 00:08:20,984
is the casino obligated
to pay his next of kin?

00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:22,485
Yes. I'll Q.D. that.

00:08:22,552 --> 00:08:24,187
And you can I.D. this.

00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,190
So, find out
what's on his shoes.

00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,692
Oh, is that all?

00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,393
We don't have
a primary crime scene.

00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,529
We need to know
where he was.

00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,532
(imitates Johnny Carson):
I'm thinking a golf course.

00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,800

Hi-oh!

(camera shutter clicking)

00:08:43,473 --> 00:08:45,909
Well, this ought to keep Hodges
busy for a while.

00:08:45,975 --> 00:08:48,511
So, uh, Dr. Ray?
Yes?

00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:50,246
What's your handicap?

00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:52,849
I don't golf.

00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,351
I thought all doctors
played golf.

00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:55,852
Maybe only
the rich ones.

00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,187
Oh, come on now.

00:08:57,253 --> 00:08:58,621
That's not true.

00:08:58,688 --> 00:08:59,723
Anybody can play golf.

00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,958
There's plenty
of public golf courses.

00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:03,827
SIDLE:
Sure there are.

00:09:03,893 --> 00:09:06,262
LANGSTON:
Mark Twain referred to golf

00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:07,797
as "A good walk spoiled."

00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:09,366
(chuckles)

00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:12,836
Well, it can be, if you don't
stay in bounds, believe me.

00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:19,642
This medium-velocity spatter

00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:23,046
I've got on the roof here
looks like it could be cast-off.

00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:27,917
(grunting)

00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,087
Was there any evidence of a
passenger at the crash site?

00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,922
LANGSTON: No, but these things
aren't exactly race cars.

00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,724
It wouldn't be hard
to jump out of one

00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,793
while it was moving.

00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,561
Which puts up back to,
where is the primary?
Right.

00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:42,732
Hey, the balls in this shag bag
are Jupiter PTXs,

00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,634
but the ones in the front rack
are Fuschidas.

00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:46,236
That's fascinating.

00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:47,771
Different balls are designed

00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,239
with different
playing characteristics.

00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:51,174
Some hit the green
and stop dead;

00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:53,810
others have a harder core
for the long game.

00:09:53,877 --> 00:09:56,012
You know,
each one is unique, Sara.

00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:58,782
Oh, just like snowflakes.

00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,917
Exactly.
I think Nick's point is

00:10:00,984 --> 00:10:03,086
two different types of balls
suggest two different players?

00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:06,089
Possibly.

00:10:06,156 --> 00:10:07,223
(cheering)

00:10:12,796 --> 00:10:14,197
Hang in there, Danny.

00:10:14,264 --> 00:10:16,700
If there's anything I can
do, you let me know, yeah?

00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:18,234
Thanks, Jonathan.
Take care, man.

00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:19,969
BRASS: Mr. Nagano,
can I talk to you?

00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,138
I'm Detective Jim Brass,
Las Vegas police.

00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,007
I need to ask you
a few questions.

00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:26,543
Do we have to do this
now, Detective?
I'm afraid so.

00:10:26,609 --> 00:10:27,711
Yeah, today's been
kind of rough.

00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:29,713
Well, been really rough
for his dad.

00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:31,881
He'll meet you in the
clubhouse, okay?

00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:33,249
Don't forget to sign
your card, kiddo.

00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:35,385
Thanks a lot.

00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:37,187
Sorry about this,
but I got to ask you,

00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:38,989
when was the last time
you saw your father?

00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,423
Last night.

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,225
There was a party
in the clubhouse.

00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:44,027
Your stepmother mentioned that.

00:10:44,094 --> 00:10:45,462
You broke his course record.

00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:47,063
Well, that must
have been tricky.

00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,932
I mean, he was a
competitive guy, right?

00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:50,166
How did he feel
about that?

00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,669
We just happened to be in
the room with the bar, so...

00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:55,905
Here's to Danny Nagano,
the new course record holder.

00:10:55,972 --> 00:10:57,841
Enjoy the night, kid.

00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,010
So you think this puts you in
the same league as your old man?

00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,579
Ah, I wouldn't set
my sights that low.
Why you little piece...

00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:05,215
Russell, please,
not on a night like tonight.

00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:07,250
Please, don't do this.
Hey, Mom, it's okay.

00:11:07,317 --> 00:11:09,052
He's just ranting
and probably drunk.

00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:11,087
Don't take that
tone with me.
No, go home, Dad.

00:11:11,154 --> 00:11:14,024
Go home before you
embarrass yourself more
than you already have.

00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,859
Why don't you
try to remember

00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,329
what this game is really about.

00:11:19,396 --> 00:11:20,897
Good night.
Just ignore him, okay?

00:11:20,964 --> 00:11:23,033
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.
It's your night.

00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,802
And that was the last thing
he ever said to me.
Hmm.

00:11:28,405 --> 00:11:30,040
I gotta go
turn in my scorecard.
No, I understand.

00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,274
Thanks for the help.

00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:32,876

How can I help you, sir?

00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:40,283
Look, I need to know
who was on duty

00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,152
at the clubhouse bar last night.

00:11:42,218 --> 00:11:44,754
Preferably somebody
with a good memory.

00:12:07,711 --> 00:12:09,212

00:12:44,748 --> 00:12:46,182
Russell Huntley's prints
are on the Jupiters.

00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:47,651
That's not surprising.

00:12:47,717 --> 00:12:49,386
Let's see what we've got
on the Fuschidas.

00:12:49,452 --> 00:12:51,187
WILLOWS:
The fragment we recovered

00:12:51,254 --> 00:12:53,990
from the victim's neck wound
is carbon fiber

00:12:54,057 --> 00:12:57,694
reinforced polymer and
thermosetting epoxide polymer.

00:12:57,761 --> 00:12:59,162
Graphite and epoxy.

00:12:59,229 --> 00:13:00,363
He got shafted.

00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,599
Yeah, the murder weapon
is most likely

00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:03,767
the composite shaft
of a golf club.

00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,969
How appropriate.
WILLOWS:
Mm-hmm.

00:13:07,249 --> 00:13:08,833
STOKES:
Here's some prints
on a Fuschida

00:13:09,661 --> 00:13:10,974
belonging to a guy

00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,342
named John Dudek.

00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:14,811

I believe he's
the son's caddy.

00:13:16,413 --> 00:13:19,849

on a Fuschida.

00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,018
Belonging to Erin Nagano.

00:13:22,085 --> 00:13:23,553
WLVU student.

00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,055
Ooh, quite a record.

00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:27,157

"DUI, disorderly conduct,

00:13:33,463 --> 00:13:35,365
She's Michelle's sister.

00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:40,170
With her prints all over
her sister's ex's balls.

00:13:57,246 --> 00:13:58,414

00:13:58,481 --> 00:14:00,116
That's me.

00:14:00,183 --> 00:14:03,553
My name's Nick...
Goggle up and tell
me who you are.

00:14:03,619 --> 00:14:05,354
Oh.

00:14:05,421 --> 00:14:08,090
Okay, sure.

00:14:08,157 --> 00:14:11,060
I'm Nick Stokes.
I'm with the Vegas Crime Lab.

00:14:12,295 --> 00:14:13,362
Interferometer?

00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:15,298
No.

00:14:15,364 --> 00:14:17,633
Optical heterodyne detector.

00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,468
Yeah.
Yeah. Nice.

00:14:19,535 --> 00:14:21,374
All right, am I getting busted?

00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:23,410
Now, why would I want to go
and do something like that?

00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:27,291
No reason. It's just
happened before.

00:14:27,357 --> 00:14:29,359
Yeah, that I do
know about you.

00:14:29,888 --> 00:14:31,833
Your prints were found
on a golf ball

00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,436
in a cart Russell Huntley's body
was found dead in.

00:14:35,638 --> 00:14:36,583
Really?

00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:38,885
P.D. passed your picture around
in the clubhouse.

00:14:38,952 --> 00:14:41,654
Bartender said he saw
you with Russell the
night that he died.

00:14:41,721 --> 00:14:44,424
<i>Said it looked like you two</i>
<i>were in a fight.</i>

00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:45,592
...leave Danny alone!

00:14:45,658 --> 00:14:47,727
I was at the party, yeah.

00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:49,462
But for Danny.

00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:51,498
I blew off my Physics 101
section so I could

00:14:51,564 --> 00:14:52,565
watch his round.

00:14:52,632 --> 00:14:54,467
And I saw every single
amazing shot.

00:14:54,534 --> 00:14:56,469
What was going on
with you and Russell?

00:14:56,536 --> 00:14:57,971
Oh, damn.

00:14:58,038 --> 00:15:00,807
I mean, you make it sound
like we're just knocking it out.

00:15:00,874 --> 00:15:03,343
Were you?

00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,311
Oh, believe me,
even if Russ hadn't been married

00:15:05,378 --> 00:15:08,481
to my sister, I'm not into
old retired pros.

00:15:08,548 --> 00:15:11,117
But if Michelle
had been married

00:15:11,184 --> 00:15:13,687
to a pro looper,
then yeah, sure,

00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:16,040
she might have had
some competition.

00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,691
A looper?
You're into caddies?

00:15:18,332 --> 00:15:19,666
What can I say?

00:15:19,698 --> 00:15:21,161
I just like a man
who hauls a big bag.

00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,831
(chuckles)

00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:25,899
Maybe Russell
was drinking.

00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:27,801
I know I was.

00:15:27,867 --> 00:15:29,602
He had a lot
to be angry about,

00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:31,738
because he was a douche,

00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,207
to my sister
and to Danny.

00:15:34,274 --> 00:15:36,242
I had as little to do with him
as possible.

00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:38,645
Still doesn't explain how
the golf ball got in the cart.

00:15:38,712 --> 00:15:40,413
I don't know
how those got there.

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,317
I mean, sometimes
I buy balls for Danny.

00:15:44,384 --> 00:15:46,219
But I've never given
anything to Russell.

00:15:46,286 --> 00:15:48,588
You buy Fuschida golf balls
for Danny.

00:15:49,723 --> 00:15:51,324
He gets all that stuff
for free.

00:15:51,391 --> 00:15:53,293
All right, look,
a couple of years ago,

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,395
before Danny started
making noise on the tour,

00:15:55,462 --> 00:15:58,331
I bought him a box of Fuschidas
before the Las Vegas Open.

00:15:58,398 --> 00:15:59,733
As a gift.

00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:02,902
You know, 'cause he
is my step-nephew.

00:16:02,969 --> 00:16:04,637
Anyways, Danny ends up winning

00:16:04,704 --> 00:16:06,940
and, ta-da,
a new tradition's born.

00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,475
Golfers are hardcore
superstitious,

00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,410
so every time Danny tees
it up in competition,

00:16:10,477 --> 00:16:12,012
I have to fork
over the dough

00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:14,180
and buy him a brand-new
box of those pills.

00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:16,049
And trust me,
they are not cheap.

00:16:16,116 --> 00:16:18,084

Well, the soil
on your vic's shoes

00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:52,084

the Fuschida golf balls

in Russell's cart
belong to Danny.

00:18:28,453 --> 00:18:30,122
Danny's prints
weren't on the balls

00:18:30,188 --> 00:18:32,357
or anywhere on the cart;
just his caddy's.

00:18:32,424 --> 00:18:34,359
At least we know who
to talk to next.

00:18:34,426 --> 00:18:36,628
Hey, guys,
you gotta see this.

00:18:36,695 --> 00:18:40,632
Before John Dudek
became a caddy,

00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:42,100
he was a professional golfer.

00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:44,603
He toured in Europe
and North America.

00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:46,238
He went from pro to caddy?

00:18:46,304 --> 00:18:48,039
Usually it's
the other way around.

00:18:48,106 --> 00:18:50,375
Well, it wasn't by choice.

00:18:50,442 --> 00:18:52,144
He was suspended
for the illegal use

00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,812
of performance-enhancing drugs.

00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:55,313
Specifically
propranolol.

00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,948
That's a beta-blocker.

<i>They're designed to lower</i>
<i>heart rate, reduce tremors.</i>

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,761
They don't really
enhance performance

00:19:09,828 --> 00:19:11,763
so much as they
ease anxiety.

00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,333
But they're still banned

00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,768
including golf.

00:19:16,835 --> 00:19:18,003
Want to know how
Dudek got caught?

00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,671
Yeah, lay it on me.

00:19:19,738 --> 00:19:21,940
Russell Huntley
dimed him out.

00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:24,409
MAN:

golf has been spared

00:19:24,476 --> 00:19:25,977
scandals involving
performance-enhancing drugs,

00:19:26,044 --> 00:19:28,613
which is why the suspension
of John Dudek

00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,550
in 1987 was
so notable.

00:19:31,616 --> 00:19:32,984
It was a disgrace.

00:19:33,051 --> 00:19:34,720
You had a very
personal stake in it.

00:19:34,786 --> 00:19:35,987
When he was on tour,

00:19:36,054 --> 00:19:38,790
you often referred to
John Dudek as a brother.

00:19:38,857 --> 00:19:40,325
That's the way
I felt about him.

00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:43,829
There's an old saying:

00:19:43,895 --> 00:19:46,098
"If you're not cheating,
you're not really trying."

00:19:46,164 --> 00:19:49,701
That kind of attitude
doesn't have a place in golf.

00:19:49,768 --> 00:19:54,039
The only person you're really
playing out there is yourself.

00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:57,909
At the end of day, when you
put your name on that scorecard,

00:19:57,976 --> 00:19:59,945
you're swearing,
"This is what I did,

00:20:00,011 --> 00:20:02,147
this is who I am."

00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:05,517
John tried to put himself
above the honor of the game.

00:20:05,584 --> 00:20:06,124
I couldn't let him.

00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:07,207

Excuse me.

00:20:37,065 --> 00:20:39,434
Come on, man, no autographs
right now. I'm working here.

00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:40,969
That was a very nice finish,

00:20:41,036 --> 00:20:42,874
but you've been laying it off
at the top a little bit lately.

00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,008
You might want
to watch that.

00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:45,043
My name's Ray Langston.

00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:46,477
I'm with the Crime Lab,

00:20:46,544 --> 00:20:49,147
and I need to speak to
Mr. Dudek, if you don't mind.

00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:50,915
Catch you later, Johnny.
I hope.

00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:55,987
How can I help you?

00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:59,023
Well, you can tell me
why we found your fingerprints

00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:02,760
on a golf ball that we found
near Russell Huntley's body.

00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:04,762
Russell Huntley--
you remember him.

00:21:04,829 --> 00:21:06,464
He's the man that turned you
into a caddy

00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,199
after he ratted you
off the tour.

00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:10,068
That was over 25 years ago.

00:21:10,134 --> 00:21:11,936
It was another lifetime.

00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:14,172
What do you want me to
say, I killed Russell

00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,207
'cause he ruined
my life?
You can say

00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:18,142
whatever you like,
Mr. Dudek.

00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:20,044
Look, I didn't
become Tiger Woods,

00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:22,146
but you want
to know something?

00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:23,615
Being Steve Williams
isn't half bad.

00:21:25,116 --> 00:21:26,751
Steve Williams is
Tiger Woods' caddy.

00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,620
I'm aware of who
Steve Williams is.

00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:31,055
I just don't care.

00:21:31,122 --> 00:21:32,957
What about your prints?

00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:35,026
I don't know.

00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,362
Maybe Russell borrowed
some of Danny's balls.

00:21:37,428 --> 00:21:41,199
I didn't get the impression
that they were that friendly.

00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,535
How'd you wind up
on Danny's bag?

00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:45,770
I was at the hospital
with Russell

00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,272
the night that Danny was born.

00:21:47,338 --> 00:21:50,942
And on the green the day
he picked up his first clubs.

00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,610
Years after Russell
blew up my career,

00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:54,913
Danny called me, asked me
if I would carry for him.

00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:55,980
Gave me a way back.

00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:57,850
He's a good kid.

00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,419
So the other day,
you and Danny

00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,055
set fire to the course,

00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:04,490
you partied at the clubhouse,

00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:05,658
and then what?

00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:07,360
Same as every night--

00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:08,694
pizza and porn.

00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:24,944
(beep)

00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:37,823
SIDLE:
<i>So, Russell corners laser girl,</i>

00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,560
argues with his son
and his ex-wife,

00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:44,530
and then leaves the party
around 7:15 p.m.

00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:46,732
His body was found
the next morning

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,067
on the golf course at...

00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:52,772
9:45 a.m., which gives us
a gap of 14 and a half hours.

00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,941
And we still don't have
a primary crime scene.

00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:58,411
Russell Huntley

00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:01,013
placed a $5,000 over/under bet

00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,416
on Danny's
first round score.

00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:04,884
Cash in on his son's success.

00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:07,386
No, actually he bet
against his son.

00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:09,722
Man, he bet the ball
on Danny?

00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:11,757
Bet the ball?
WILLOWS:
He bet the over.

00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:14,594
He bet that his son,
a professional golfer,

00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,262
wouldn't even
break par.
That's cold.

00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:17,897
LANGSTON:
Danny shot 61.

00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:20,266
Russell lost the bet--
big time.

00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,802
Sounds like a better theory
for father killing son.

00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:26,806
STOKES:
You know, Danny's round
was pretty incredible.

00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,407
I mean, a 61's no joke.

00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:31,043
There's nothing in his
recent tournament history

00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:35,047
to suggest he was on the verge
of blowing up.

00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:38,084
What if Danny was cheating?

00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,253
And his father
found out about it.

00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,454
Danny's caddy,

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,457
John Dudek,
has a history of cheating.

00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,325
"Honor the game above all else."

00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:48,995
That was Russell's credo.

00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:50,596
WILLOWS:
Well, if you think

00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:52,198
that cheating
is a viable motive,

00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:53,900
see if you can prove it.

00:23:58,122 --> 00:23:59,857
Every amateur golfer,
at one time or another,

00:23:59,923 --> 00:24:02,493
has used the old foot-wedge
to improve his lie,

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,495
but it's a big no-no
in tournament play.

00:24:04,561 --> 00:24:05,963
I once played
a podiatrist

00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,332
who used to apply
lip balm to his driver

00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:09,800
to reduce his side spin.

00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:11,035
He still couldn't
break a hundred.

00:24:11,101 --> 00:24:12,670
I thought you said
you didn't play.

00:24:12,736 --> 00:24:14,238
I did, once
upon a time,

00:24:14,305 --> 00:24:16,507
but not anymore.

00:24:16,573 --> 00:24:18,542
So how does a
professional golfer cheat

00:24:18,609 --> 00:24:21,478
with the cameras and the eyes
of the gallery on him?

00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:23,213
Think the answer
is in these pages?

00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,350
The list of conforming balls
is 35 pages long.

00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:28,652
So is the list
of non-conforming balls.

00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:29,820
Right.
Conforming drivers,

00:24:29,887 --> 00:24:32,656
non-conforming drivers.

00:24:32,723 --> 00:24:35,092
Standards designed to balance
human skill

00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:36,360
against technological advantage.

00:24:36,427 --> 00:24:38,562
To prevent things

00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:40,831
like drivers
from adding distance

00:24:40,898 --> 00:24:43,267
<i>with a trampoline effect.</i>

00:24:43,334 --> 00:24:45,402
STOKES: <i>Or that</i>
<i>the ball's dimple pattern</i>

00:24:45,469 --> 00:24:48,539
<i>doesn't greatly reduce</i>
<i>the drag or spin rate.</i>

00:24:48,605 --> 00:24:49,907
But it's still just a game.

00:24:49,974 --> 00:24:52,343
It's a golfer,
a club and a ball.

00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:54,378
Yeah. Yeah,
if Danny was cheating,

00:24:54,445 --> 00:24:56,313
he was either messing
with the ball, his club

00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,348
or his body.

00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:59,183
Or all three.
Mm-hmm.

00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:01,652
DANNY:
I just don't understand
why they need my clubs.

00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:02,987
It's all in the warrant.

00:25:03,053 --> 00:25:05,856
Come on in here.
I want to show you something.

00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:07,157
Sit here.

00:25:07,224 --> 00:25:08,592
Watch this. Check it out.

00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:12,429
HUNTLEY:
Golf is not a game of perfect.

00:25:12,496 --> 00:25:15,265
No matter how good you are,
you'll want to get better at it,

00:25:15,332 --> 00:25:16,734
and you'll never master it.

00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,369
But that,
like any great love affair,

00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:21,472
is the pain and the passion
of golf,

00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:22,506
whether you're playing against

00:25:22,573 --> 00:25:24,308
the greatest players
in the world

00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:25,442
or just knocking around

00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:28,245
on a late afternoon
with your son.

00:25:28,312 --> 00:25:31,048
Why are you
showing me this?

00:25:31,115 --> 00:25:32,916
You know, jog your memory
a little bit.

00:25:32,983 --> 00:25:35,519
I mean, for someone whose father
just got killed,

00:25:35,586 --> 00:25:38,322
you seem a little... detached.

00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:41,558
Hmm? Why is that?

00:25:42,995 --> 00:25:45,264
You know what I remember
most about that day?

00:25:45,331 --> 00:25:46,499
What?

00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:49,491
My dad's driver.

00:25:50,525 --> 00:25:52,927
It was a gift from Byron Nelson.

00:25:52,994 --> 00:25:54,896
Hmm.
A '55 five-screw

00:25:54,963 --> 00:25:57,232
MacGregor MT Eye-O-Matic.

00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:58,633
He loved that club.

00:26:02,037 --> 00:26:04,139
My father started coaching me
when I was five.

00:26:04,205 --> 00:26:05,740
Dropped me when I was 19.

00:26:05,807 --> 00:26:07,309
Too many false starts.

00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:09,177
Too many choked-out
finishes, he said.

00:26:09,244 --> 00:26:11,012
Didn't have what it takes.

00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:13,081
So is that why
you brought Dudek back, huh?

00:26:13,148 --> 00:26:14,916
To stick it to
the old man?

00:26:14,983 --> 00:26:16,618
Give yourself a
different kind of edge?

00:26:16,685 --> 00:26:19,087
You think I'm cheating?

00:26:19,154 --> 00:26:20,922
Sir, I'm gonna take your blood.

00:26:20,989 --> 00:26:22,624
You're not taking anything from
me. Is that what you think?

00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:25,193
I can come back later...
No, do it now.

00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,862
We're gonna take your blood.
It's in the warrant.

00:26:57,325 --> 00:27:00,195
♪ ♪

00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:19,347
(beeping)

00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,727
Nice.

00:27:32,794 --> 00:27:35,130
Thanks.

00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:37,699
LANGSTON:
There is nothing unusual
about any of his clubs.

00:27:37,766 --> 00:27:39,801
And all of his golf
balls check out.

00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:41,970
Dimple pattern,
weight, diameter,

00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:43,505
they're all up to spec.

00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:46,341
So I got expanded tox
on Danny Nagano's blood,

00:27:46,408 --> 00:27:47,542
and I got nothing.

00:27:47,609 --> 00:27:49,577
No traces
of propranolol

00:27:49,644 --> 00:27:51,813
or any other beta-blockers
in his system.

00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,315
Maybe we were wrong.

00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:55,617
Maybe Danny has game
after all.

00:27:56,751 --> 00:27:59,321
Sorry; I'm sorry.
I'll clean that up.

00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:01,022
That's all right...
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:28:01,089 --> 00:28:03,091
(golf ball bouncing, clacking)

00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,410
What is it?

00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:17,980
A not-so-inelastic collision.

00:28:22,485 --> 00:28:23,919
HODGES:
Hey, guys.

00:28:23,986 --> 00:28:25,988
LANGSTON: Hodges, you want
to know what we're doing?

00:28:26,055 --> 00:28:28,824
I guess that means you found
the primary crime scene.

00:28:36,565 --> 00:28:40,336
The center mass of the ball
from Russell's cart

00:28:40,402 --> 00:28:42,571
is almost 20% harder
than it should be.

00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,607
Danny was definitely cheating.

00:28:44,673 --> 00:28:46,742
There was no evidence
of any tampering on the shell,

00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:49,311
so how do you harden
a polybutadiene core

00:28:49,378 --> 00:28:51,614
without leaving a mark?

00:28:54,183 --> 00:28:56,852
Frickin' laser beams.

00:28:58,087 --> 00:29:01,657
Isn't this, like, a matter
for, like, the USGA?

00:29:01,724 --> 00:29:04,960
Murder during the course
of a felony, such as fraud,

00:29:05,027 --> 00:29:06,495
is a matter for us.

00:29:06,562 --> 00:29:07,730
Whoa.

00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:09,131
Murder?

00:29:09,198 --> 00:29:10,266
That's right.

00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,334
You know, I...

00:29:12,401 --> 00:29:14,370
I read a lot, Erin.

00:29:14,436 --> 00:29:17,239
And I remember a write-up
a few years back

00:29:17,306 --> 00:29:19,842
about some Japanese scientists
who exposed golf balls

00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:22,511
to focused X-ray sources.

00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,614
<i>They found that</i>
<i>the radiation altered</i>

00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:28,851
<i>the composition of the cores,</i>
<i>making them harder,</i>

00:29:28,918 --> 00:29:31,153
<i>which increased</i>
<i>the distance per drive.</i>

00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,155
I mean, it's not a hard
experiment to duplicate.

00:29:33,222 --> 00:29:34,857
Especially not for a bright,

00:29:34,924 --> 00:29:36,192
young laser jockey
like yourself.

00:29:36,258 --> 00:29:38,527
All right,
so I juiced the balls.

00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:40,930
But that's all.

00:29:40,996 --> 00:29:43,866
Giving them to Danny,
that was Dudek's idea.

00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:45,167
I heard Erin bragging
in the clubhouse,

00:29:45,234 --> 00:29:47,036
a few weeks ago,
about what she could do

00:29:47,102 --> 00:29:48,070
with her lasers and balls.

00:29:48,137 --> 00:29:49,672
So I asked her
if she could make me some.

00:29:49,738 --> 00:29:51,841
Did you tell her what for?
She didn't care.

00:29:51,907 --> 00:29:54,743
She just wanted one thing
in exchange--

00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,679
Sex.

00:29:56,745 --> 00:29:59,081
Bad kitty, I know.

00:29:59,148 --> 00:30:01,250
I'm only consoled, though,
by some recent studies

00:30:01,317 --> 00:30:04,541
suggesting a link between
IQ and sex drive.

00:30:05,028 --> 00:30:06,129
In women.

00:30:06,195 --> 00:30:07,797
Hmm.

00:30:07,864 --> 00:30:09,165
Danny just needed a edge.

00:30:09,232 --> 00:30:10,667
Making a living
on ten percent

00:30:10,733 --> 00:30:14,938
doesn't work unless your man's
into the serious money.

00:30:15,004 --> 00:30:16,506
Right?

00:30:16,572 --> 00:30:17,707
All right.

00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:18,841
I needed an edge.

00:30:18,908 --> 00:30:20,276
Danny had nothing
to do with it.

00:30:20,343 --> 00:30:22,612
Why do I find that
so hard to believe?

00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:23,980
The kid has
never cheated

00:30:24,047 --> 00:30:25,848
a day in his life.

00:30:25,915 --> 00:30:27,050
He had no idea.

00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,751
He-He was just having
a great round.

00:30:31,888 --> 00:30:33,056
Try this.

00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:35,325
A nine iron?
I can't get there with that.

00:30:35,391 --> 00:30:37,894
You can today, kiddo.
Believe.

00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,240
(cheering)

00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,443
But Russell...
he figured it out, didn't he?

00:30:53,509 --> 00:30:54,711
He knew better.

00:30:54,777 --> 00:30:56,379
Yeah.

00:30:56,446 --> 00:30:59,015
Danny didn't have enough talent
to play the way he did today.

00:30:59,082 --> 00:31:01,718
You gave him some of those
damn laser balls, didn't you?

00:31:01,784 --> 00:31:04,087
Look, I don't know what
you're talking about, sunshine.

00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,255
Is this Dudek's idea?

00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,723
Is Dudek helping Danny cheat?

00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:07,857
Is that it?

00:31:07,924 --> 00:31:09,459
Why don't you just
leave Danny alone?

00:31:09,525 --> 00:31:11,060
Just let him enjoy the moment.

00:31:11,127 --> 00:31:13,029
MAN:
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention please.

00:31:13,096 --> 00:31:15,098
Duffy would like
to say a few words.

00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:18,501
And that was the last time that
I saw him alive; I swear.

00:31:18,568 --> 00:31:20,603
Why should
I believe you now, Erin?

00:31:22,071 --> 00:31:24,007
Can I borrow your phone?

00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,609
I'm not calling a lawyer.

00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,880
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

00:31:32,915 --> 00:31:34,917
I can show you my alibi.

00:31:37,153 --> 00:31:40,123
I put a Webcam
in my lab.

00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,191
To document research.

00:31:42,258 --> 00:31:43,860
You see, um,

00:31:43,927 --> 00:31:46,562
I couldn't have
killed Russell.

00:31:48,264 --> 00:31:50,566
I was kind of busy.

00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:52,902
Yeah, yeah, kind of.

00:31:56,863 --> 00:31:58,698
Like I said,

00:31:58,764 --> 00:32:00,833
pizza and porn.

00:32:16,145 --> 00:32:20,082
<i>Rhizoctonia solani.</i>

00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:22,810
It's a fungus that causes
"large patch disease"

00:32:22,876 --> 00:32:24,211
in zoysia grass
and Bermuda grass.

00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:26,981
A fungus on a
golf course is bad.

00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:28,949
Yes, but for us,
it's very, very good.

00:32:29,016 --> 00:32:29,950
You see,

00:32:30,017 --> 00:32:31,952
the greenskeepers
at Copper Glen

00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:34,355
are doing a magnificent job
keeping the Rhizoc at bay.

00:32:34,421 --> 00:32:35,622
Only two areas

00:32:35,689 --> 00:32:36,790
are currently affected.

00:32:36,857 --> 00:32:38,459
This one near the
clubhouse is being used

00:32:38,525 --> 00:32:40,928
during the tournament
by the media.

00:32:40,995 --> 00:32:42,963
But this one
is a private teaching range

00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,732
behind course number two.

00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:47,001
Technically, it's closed.

00:32:47,067 --> 00:32:50,304
You see what you can accomplish
when your pride's on the line?

00:32:50,371 --> 00:32:53,240
Every day of my life.

00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:05,052
(beeping)

00:33:24,672 --> 00:33:27,875
Okay, so we have Russell's bag,

00:33:27,941 --> 00:33:31,812
his jacket
and an open box of Fuschidas.

00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:37,084
Weird,
there's no driver in here.

00:33:42,923 --> 00:33:44,591
SIDLE:
Here's Hodge's fungus.

00:33:44,658 --> 00:33:46,260
You know, golf always

00:33:46,327 --> 00:33:49,363
struck me as the kind of sport
that might appeal to Grissom.

00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,698
(laughing)
I don't know.

00:33:50,764 --> 00:33:52,366
It's never come up.

00:33:52,433 --> 00:33:56,637
Sometimes I wonder
if you two are really married.

00:33:56,704 --> 00:33:58,973
Well, now that you mention it...

00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:01,442
Just kidding.

00:34:01,508 --> 00:34:04,078
6,000 miles, huh?

00:34:05,112 --> 00:34:07,581
So far, so good.

00:34:07,648 --> 00:34:08,816
All right.

00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:15,990
Looks like some
paint transfer here.

00:34:17,024 --> 00:34:19,393
It's red, like the driver head.

00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:31,672
Busted graphite shaft.

00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:32,940
Grip end.

00:34:35,442 --> 00:34:36,810
No sign of the head.

00:34:36,877 --> 00:34:38,445
I got some blowflies
over here.

00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:43,317
(camera shutter clicking)

00:34:57,564 --> 00:35:00,000
Now, this looks like
murder to me.

00:35:01,747 --> 00:35:03,348
WILLOWS:
<i>We found black and red</i>
<i>enamel paint traces</i>

00:35:03,415 --> 00:35:05,117
<i>in the concrete</i>
<i>near the practice tee,</i>

00:35:05,183 --> 00:35:07,953
<i>consistent with a Fuschida</i>
<i>driver head.</i>

00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,622
We believe that the club broke
in the course of a struggle,

00:35:10,689 --> 00:35:13,058
and that it was used as a weapon
to kill Russell Huntley.

00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:14,526
Hmm.

00:35:14,593 --> 00:35:16,928
Well, I didn't do
anything to Russell.

00:35:16,995 --> 00:35:19,398
Well, you were there.

00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:22,134
And so was Michelle.

00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,568
She didn't have a thing
to do with this.

00:35:23,635 --> 00:35:24,936
Well, then tell me
what happened.

00:35:31,108 --> 00:35:34,044
Russell had accused me
of cheating.

00:35:34,111 --> 00:35:36,647
I break your course record, so
I must be cheating, is that it?

00:35:36,713 --> 00:35:38,582
You are a jealous old man.

00:35:38,649 --> 00:35:41,151
And you're a fraud.
And if you got the guts,

00:35:41,218 --> 00:35:43,253
you meet me at the
teaching range in an hour

00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,855
and I'll prove it to you.

00:35:47,357 --> 00:35:51,695
Try to remember what this
game is really about.

00:35:51,762 --> 00:35:54,965
DANNY:
<i>And what it's about is honor.</i>

00:35:55,032 --> 00:35:56,700
<i>And that's why I had to go.</i>

00:35:58,035 --> 00:35:59,936
HUNTLEY:
That's the best I got.

00:36:01,738 --> 00:36:02,906
Not bad, huh?

00:36:02,973 --> 00:36:04,107
All right,
that was a new ball.

00:36:04,174 --> 00:36:06,677
Now I'm gonna do it again
with this one.

00:36:06,743 --> 00:36:08,545
Took this out of your bag
in the clubhouse.

00:36:08,612 --> 00:36:10,147
This is what you, uh,

00:36:10,213 --> 00:36:12,049
shot your big 61 with.

00:36:18,555 --> 00:36:20,524
He said the balls
were juiced.

00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,492
Yeah, they were.

00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:24,661
Whether you knew it
or not.

00:36:24,728 --> 00:36:28,098
You know, I switched
to new balls the next day, so...

00:36:28,165 --> 00:36:29,533
I don't know, maybe I did know.

00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,336
On my best day, I was never
able to hit it that good.

00:36:34,104 --> 00:36:35,305
Okay.

00:36:35,372 --> 00:36:36,673
So then what happened?

00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,442
I left.

00:36:38,508 --> 00:36:41,111
You gotta man up and
come clean, Danny.

00:36:41,178 --> 00:36:42,379
This is insane, all right?

00:36:42,446 --> 00:36:43,714
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,915
You gotta go to those officials,

00:36:44,982 --> 00:36:48,085
confess and take the
consequences, you hear me?

00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:50,387
It's better to lose
than to be a cheater.

00:36:50,454 --> 00:36:51,788
Go to hell, Dad!

00:36:51,855 --> 00:36:53,890
I said I don't know
what you're talking about!

00:36:53,957 --> 00:36:55,158
You gotta tell them!

00:36:55,225 --> 00:36:57,027
You hear me, son,
you've gotta tell them!

00:36:57,094 --> 00:36:58,462
You gotta tell them or I will!

00:36:58,528 --> 00:37:00,697
You gotta tell them
what you did!

00:37:00,764 --> 00:37:03,800
You tell them or I will,
you hear me?!

00:37:03,867 --> 00:37:05,869
So you're saying that
he was alive when you left?

00:37:05,936 --> 00:37:07,204
There wasn't a struggle?

00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,839
I never touched him.

00:37:08,905 --> 00:37:10,140
Well, did your stepmother
witness anything?

00:37:10,207 --> 00:37:11,908
I just saw Michelle
driving up

00:37:11,975 --> 00:37:13,477
as I was leaving.

00:37:17,614 --> 00:37:20,284
Danny? Danny!

00:37:21,351 --> 00:37:23,487
(sighing)

00:37:23,553 --> 00:37:26,957
She would never hurt anyone.

00:37:29,192 --> 00:37:31,662
Yes, I did see Danny on his
way out of the teaching range.

00:37:31,728 --> 00:37:33,864
What were you
doing up there?

00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:37,267
I was just going to hit
a few, blow off some steam.

00:37:37,334 --> 00:37:39,102
It's nice and quiet up there.

00:37:39,169 --> 00:37:41,438
But when I saw Danny leaving,
I turned around

00:37:41,505 --> 00:37:43,073
and followed him
back to the clubhouse.

00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,976
So you never went
to the practice tee?

00:37:46,043 --> 00:37:47,911
Listen, uh,

00:37:47,978 --> 00:37:51,748
I know you want to protect
Danny, I understand that.

00:37:51,815 --> 00:37:53,650
But the best way to protect him

00:37:53,717 --> 00:37:55,118
is to tell me the truth.

00:37:55,185 --> 00:37:56,353
I told you before.

00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:59,122
I don't know what
happened to Russell.

00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:01,658
Well, I think I do.

00:38:01,725 --> 00:38:04,661
I think you went up
to the practice tee,

00:38:04,728 --> 00:38:08,465
and you saw what your stepson
had done to his father.

00:38:08,532 --> 00:38:10,467
Danny?

00:38:10,534 --> 00:38:12,536
Danny!

00:38:16,974 --> 00:38:19,743
And you left.

00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,144
You walked away.

00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:22,946
And you didn't even bother

00:38:23,013 --> 00:38:25,616
to make an anonymous
phone call for help.

00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:29,119
That never happened.

00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:37,294
I figure she sees him
and leaves.

00:38:37,361 --> 00:38:39,663
He gets into the cart to try to
get help and doesn't make it.

00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,999
Agreed, but we still
have no way to determine

00:38:42,065 --> 00:38:43,200
who's telling the truth.

00:38:43,266 --> 00:38:44,267
Either Danny's
protecting Michelle

00:38:44,334 --> 00:38:45,669
or Michelle's
protecting Danny.

00:38:45,736 --> 00:38:47,738
Or the two of them
are in on it together.

00:38:47,804 --> 00:38:50,407
They certainly both had their
reasons to want Russell dead.

00:38:50,474 --> 00:38:52,009
What we need
is the murder weapon.

00:38:52,075 --> 00:38:53,443
All right, assuming
that Russell was stabbed

00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:56,446
with the broken club head
at the teaching range,

00:38:56,513 --> 00:38:58,949
then the cast-off on
the golf cart's roof

00:38:59,016 --> 00:39:01,685
probably came from when he
pulled it out of his neck.
Yes.

00:39:01,752 --> 00:39:03,887
LANGSTON: <i>Since we know</i>
<i>where he crashed...</i>

00:39:03,954 --> 00:39:05,956
WILLOWS:
<i>We know where to look.</i>

00:39:32,449 --> 00:39:34,918
SIDLE: <i>I've got bad news</i>
<i>and worse news.</i>

00:39:34,985 --> 00:39:36,286
Let's hear it.

00:39:36,353 --> 00:39:37,721
Bad news is the
only prints that

00:39:37,788 --> 00:39:38,789
I recovered
from the murder weapon

00:39:38,855 --> 00:39:40,123
are a match to the victim.

00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:44,661
So we can't put the murder
weapon in the hands of

00:39:44,728 --> 00:39:45,762
either one of
our suspects?

00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:48,231
It exonerates the both of them.

00:39:48,298 --> 00:39:50,500
Yeah, that's the, uh,
worse news part.

00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:53,136
So, both Danny and Michelle
just walk?

00:39:57,074 --> 00:40:00,844
Sara, can you blow up the prints

00:40:00,911 --> 00:40:02,913
on the grip
there, please?
Sure.

00:40:09,386 --> 00:40:12,255
That's a partial palm print.

00:40:12,322 --> 00:40:15,626
Nick, you familiar with any of
the urban legends about golf?

00:40:15,692 --> 00:40:17,527
Vaguely.

00:40:17,594 --> 00:40:19,896
Look at the orientation
of the prints.

00:40:21,665 --> 00:40:23,300
I think I know
what you're getting at.

00:40:25,535 --> 00:40:28,138
LANGSTON:
<i>When I told the company rep</i>
<i>what we were doing,</i>

00:40:28,205 --> 00:40:31,441
he was more than happy
to lend us the robot.

00:40:37,581 --> 00:40:40,851
All right, why don't we
let the big dog eat?

00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:43,887
You know, Ray,

00:40:43,954 --> 00:40:45,489
for somebody
who doesn't like golf,

00:40:45,555 --> 00:40:47,557
you certainly seem to know
an awful lot about it.

00:40:47,624 --> 00:40:48,992
It's not that
I don't like golf.

00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:52,496
It's just that you have
to focus your mind,

00:40:52,562 --> 00:40:55,198
practically every fiber
of your being

00:40:55,265 --> 00:40:56,400
on a small white ball

00:40:56,466 --> 00:40:58,502
that you want to hit
just the right way,

00:40:58,568 --> 00:41:01,171
and then when you hit it...

00:41:01,238 --> 00:41:02,973
the feeling is exhilarating.

00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,376
And so you chase
the small, white ball

00:41:06,443 --> 00:41:09,112
all day...
Mm-hmm.

00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:11,348
so that you can hit it
exactly the same way.

00:41:11,415 --> 00:41:13,050
You chase that feeling.

00:41:13,116 --> 00:41:14,484
It's kind of like cocaine.

00:41:14,551 --> 00:41:16,520
Not exactly

00:41:16,586 --> 00:41:19,656
the best hobby
for an obsessive personality.

00:41:19,723 --> 00:41:22,559
Yeah, people like that
are better suited for a job

00:41:22,626 --> 00:41:24,061
in criminalistics, huh?

00:41:26,496 --> 00:41:28,265
Wow, you guys weren't kidding
about this thing.

00:41:28,332 --> 00:41:30,334
That's a lot of technology
for smacking golf balls.

00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,502
It can be a serious game.

00:41:32,569 --> 00:41:34,104
Okay, so what's your theory?

00:41:34,171 --> 00:41:35,405
What caught our eye were

00:41:35,472 --> 00:41:37,908
Russell's partial
palm prints on the shaft,

00:41:37,975 --> 00:41:39,276
just below the grip.

00:41:39,343 --> 00:41:41,411
Yeah, and when Danny
left his dad,

00:41:41,478 --> 00:41:45,582
he said he was just pounding
his club against the ground.

00:41:45,649 --> 00:41:48,118
LANGSTON:
<i>He was mad as hell and he</i>
<i>wasn't gonna take it anymore.</i>

00:41:57,461 --> 00:41:58,462
STOKES:
Fore!

00:42:00,631 --> 00:42:01,632
Oh!

00:42:11,441 --> 00:42:13,076
(gasping, gagging)

00:42:13,143 --> 00:42:16,213
That's gotta be about
a one-in-a-million shot.

00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,714
STOKES:
It is.

00:42:17,781 --> 00:42:20,117
And believe it or not,
it's not just an urban legend.

00:42:20,183 --> 00:42:22,286
There are at least
four reported cases,

00:42:22,352 --> 00:42:23,787
worldwide, of golfers

00:42:23,854 --> 00:42:26,290
who accidentally
killed themselves

00:42:26,356 --> 00:42:28,058
by breaking their clubs.

00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:29,626
Well, there's a lesson in that.

00:42:29,693 --> 00:42:30,961
What?

00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:33,151
Don't drive angry.
Don't drive angry.
