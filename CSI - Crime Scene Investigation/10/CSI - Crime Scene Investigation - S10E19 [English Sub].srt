Hey. You kids are

00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:49,810
what's going on outside.

00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:53,413
(thunder crashing)

00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,239
STOKES:
Man, this town floods
at the drop of a hat.

00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,775
Water's almost up
to the street.

00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,644
We're lucky he got
tangled up in the bars.

00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,547
Kid could be spilled out
in the desert by now.

00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,783
Yeah, but we could
still lose him

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,351
if the water
starts to drop.

00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:32,719
Cuff his wrist to the gate.

00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,387
I'll go down below
when it's safe

00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:35,789
and get him out of there.

00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:37,424
Good call.

00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,067
(thunder rumbling)

00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,536
Hey, Catherine.

00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,905
Didn't expect to see
you out here.

00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,306
You like the rain?

00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,041
I was in the area.

00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,643
He was obviously trying
to claw his way out.

00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,178
Any I.D.?

00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:02,015
No, no I.D., but I can't exactly
check his pockets right now.

00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:04,885
This is technically
off school property,

00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:07,120
but he looks young enough
to be a student.

00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,256
We're still trying to contact
the principal now.

00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,991
Phil Anderson.

00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,859
He's certainly had
his hands full this semester.

00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,327
STOKES:
Oh, yeah, that's right,

00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,996
Lindsey goes
to school here, doesn't she?

00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,932
WILLOWS:
Yeah, she had a late rehearsal.

00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,001
Actually, I was here
to pick her up.

00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,371
Hey.

00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,273
Lindsey, honey.

00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,608
Are you okay?

00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,278
Do you know that boy?

00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:35,048
Yeah. It's Sean Becker.

00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,083
He goes to school here.

00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,187
Was he a friend?
No.

00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,722
Look, Mom, I know
this is going to sound bad,

00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,926

PHILLIPS:
I think I've bumped into
every piece of dog poop

00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:33,897
and used condom in
the city of Las Vegas.

00:04:33,964 --> 00:04:36,299
Aw, David, suck it up.

00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:39,870
There he is.

00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:47,277
Yep, he's dead.

00:04:47,344 --> 00:04:50,681
David, you think
you have a hard job?

00:04:50,747 --> 00:04:53,884
Well, Officer, I am
the one who has to
haul him out of here.

00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,252
WILLOWS:
Unlock the cuffs.

00:04:55,318 --> 00:04:56,420
OFFICER:
Got it.

00:04:56,486 --> 00:04:57,888
Okay, get under his pit.

00:04:57,954 --> 00:04:59,289
Gently.

00:04:59,356 --> 00:05:00,624
Gently.

00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:03,226
All right.

00:05:03,293 --> 00:05:04,227
Got him?

00:05:04,294 --> 00:05:05,462
Good. Okay.

00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:08,765
(siren wailing)

00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,972
STOKES:
The only way to get
something as big a body

00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:20,177
into the drain system
is through an access
point on the line.

00:05:20,243 --> 00:05:21,845
This is the first
one upstream.

00:05:21,912 --> 00:05:24,014
It looks like there's
a service platform down there.

00:05:24,081 --> 00:05:25,749
Mm-hmm.

00:05:25,816 --> 00:05:27,084
Feeling lucky?

00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,053
Well, it is Vegas.

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,022
After you.

00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:36,893
SANDERS:
You know, the city's got like
350 miles of storm drain

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,428
running under it.

00:05:38,495 --> 00:05:40,630
I've heard there's probably
a thousand homeless

00:05:40,697 --> 00:05:42,065
living down here.

00:05:42,132 --> 00:05:44,968
High ground spots like this
must be prime real estate.

00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:57,381
STOKES:
This is the same design
that kid had

00:05:57,447 --> 00:05:58,915
tattooed on his hand.

00:05:58,982 --> 00:06:00,617
Maybe this was his hangout.

00:06:00,684 --> 00:06:03,020
It's close
to the school.

00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:05,622
Good place to catch
a buzz between classes.

00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:07,424
Could have been huffing out
the storm

00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:09,092
and puffing up a storm.

00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:12,162
Passed out and rolled
into the drink.

00:06:14,531 --> 00:06:17,534
Yeah, that's possible.

00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:21,571
You know, this spot's
beginning to look

00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:24,875
more like a Klan house
than a clubhouse.

00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:31,915
Numerous perimortem abrasions.

00:06:31,982 --> 00:06:34,251
Small puncture wounds.

00:06:34,317 --> 00:06:37,387
All consistent with tumbling
through debris filled water.

00:06:39,756 --> 00:06:42,125
That--

00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:45,495
is a white supremacist tattoo.

00:06:45,562 --> 00:06:48,598
Knuckles thickened,

00:06:48,665 --> 00:06:49,966
discolored.

00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:52,869
This boy was no stranger

00:06:52,936 --> 00:06:55,339
to using his fists.

00:06:55,405 --> 00:06:57,474
Dr. Langston, I think
you should take a look.

00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:58,975
There's no writing
on the back,

00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:01,378
and nothing to indicate
who or where--

00:07:01,445 --> 00:07:03,280
at least, not as far
as I can tell.

00:07:03,347 --> 00:07:05,816
A racist carrying a picture
of two young black girls.

00:07:05,882 --> 00:07:07,951
Could be targets.

00:07:08,018 --> 00:07:09,886
Assuming they're not
already victims.

00:07:09,953 --> 00:07:12,889
WILLOWS:
<i>So Lindsey has told me</i>
<i>a little bit</i>

00:07:12,956 --> 00:07:14,157
about Sean Becker.

00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:15,625
What can you
tell me?

00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:17,794
Same crap,
different iteration.

00:07:17,861 --> 00:07:20,998
Abusive father-- used
to disappear for long
periods of time.

00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:23,767
Until he finally came
out of the closet,

00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:26,169
left Sean's mother
for another man.

00:07:26,236 --> 00:07:27,871
The mother was
already unstable,

00:07:27,938 --> 00:07:31,008
so the father's departure
just knocked her into a
psychiatric institution.

00:07:31,074 --> 00:07:32,976
That kid was filled
with hate.

00:07:33,043 --> 00:07:34,978
Blacks, Jews, gays.

00:07:35,045 --> 00:07:37,347
Well, I'm going to need
his disciplinary files,

00:07:37,414 --> 00:07:39,850
and I'll need to talk
to his friends.

00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,451
That would be Daryl Johnson
and Karl Hart.

00:07:41,518 --> 00:07:42,586
But good luck finding them.

00:07:42,652 --> 00:07:44,654
I suspended them both
when I kicked Sean out.

00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:45,989
Well, just give me
their info--

00:07:46,056 --> 00:07:48,425
we'll find them.
Oh, man.

00:07:48,492 --> 00:07:50,027
Billy Tinker-- that's
the boy that was killed

00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:51,228
in the hit-and-run
two months ago.

00:07:51,294 --> 00:07:53,230
The gay student.
There isn't a kid in this school

00:07:53,296 --> 00:07:54,865
who thinks his death
was a accident.

00:07:54,931 --> 00:07:56,533
Half of them think Sean did it.

00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,602
Do you?

00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:00,904
You're the cop,
you tell me.

00:08:00,971 --> 00:08:03,707
As far as I know,
it's still an open case.

00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,976
Well...

00:08:06,043 --> 00:08:11,048
After Billy was killed,
a bunch of students formed

00:08:11,114 --> 00:08:13,050
a gay and lesbian
defense league.

00:08:13,116 --> 00:08:16,453
Fights broke out
all over the place.

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,056
So I organized Tolerance Week
to help defuse things.

00:08:19,122 --> 00:08:20,791
Sean and his pals

00:08:20,857 --> 00:08:23,560
always seemed to be
around the action, so...

00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:26,630
Just one more thing.

00:08:26,697 --> 00:08:28,865
Do you recognize these girls?

00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:30,100
They're not
students here.

00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:32,636
I've never seen them before.

00:08:32,703 --> 00:08:35,138
BRASS:
<i>Okay, let me</i>
<i>get this straight--</i>

00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:37,741
you'd rather do the legwork
on a next-of-kin notification--

00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,777
you'd rather do that than slog
around in the sewer

00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:43,113
looking for evidence?

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,149
I mean, that-that is not
the down and dirty Sara Sidle

00:08:46,216 --> 00:08:47,718
I used to know.

00:08:47,784 --> 00:08:50,220
I like to know
where haters come from.

00:08:50,287 --> 00:08:52,322
Maybe you'll get your chance.

00:08:57,294 --> 00:08:58,962
May I help you?

00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:03,300
Can I get you some tea?

00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:04,668
No, thank you.

00:09:04,735 --> 00:09:06,236
No, no, no, thank you.

00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,105
Um, so you're Sean Becker's

00:09:08,171 --> 00:09:10,040
guardian,
is that right?

00:09:10,107 --> 00:09:11,108
Yes, it is.

00:09:11,174 --> 00:09:13,176
Mrs. Becker, please sit down.

00:09:13,243 --> 00:09:14,578
Sit down.

00:09:14,644 --> 00:09:16,913
I have some
bad news.

00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,648
Sean's dead.

00:09:18,715 --> 00:09:21,651
His body was found
in a storm drain
near the high school.

00:09:21,718 --> 00:09:23,587
I'm sorry
to tell you this.

00:09:23,653 --> 00:09:26,323
Oh, no.

00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,160
Oh, my God.

00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:31,762
(sobbing)

00:09:31,828 --> 00:09:33,730
We're sorry
for your loss.

00:09:38,568 --> 00:09:39,770
Ma'am--

00:09:39,836 --> 00:09:43,140
we need to take a look
around Sean's room.

00:09:43,206 --> 00:09:45,275
Would that be okay with you?

00:09:45,342 --> 00:09:47,411
(sniffs)

00:09:47,477 --> 00:09:49,613
Oh, of course, 
of course.

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,314
It's--

00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:55,719
it's the first room
on the right.

00:10:02,326 --> 00:10:03,794
When Sean comes back,

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,563
I'm sure he'll be happy
to show you around.

00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,699
Now, now, now, Mrs. Becker...

00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:10,701
you understand what
I'm telling you, right?

00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:12,169
You know?

00:10:12,235 --> 00:10:14,905
Sean's not coming back.

00:10:14,971 --> 00:10:17,507
He's-- he's dead.

00:10:17,574 --> 00:10:18,842
He's, uh...

00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,345
he's with Jesus.

00:10:23,113 --> 00:10:24,381
He's with Jesus.

00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:28,819
Oh.

00:10:28,885 --> 00:10:31,321
How did that happen?

00:10:31,388 --> 00:10:34,491
That's what we're
here to find out.

00:10:34,558 --> 00:10:38,829
Well, then, we'll just have
to wait for Sean to get back.

00:10:38,895 --> 00:10:41,565
He'll certainly be able

00:10:41,631 --> 00:10:45,702
to shed some light
on-- on, um...

00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:47,604
Uh...
It's okay.

00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:48,638
It's okay.

00:10:48,705 --> 00:10:50,107
Can I get you some tea?

00:10:50,173 --> 00:10:52,409
That'd be great.

00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,039
(sighs)

00:11:22,105 --> 00:11:24,508
The grandmother's
non compos mentis.

00:11:24,574 --> 00:11:25,976
She has

00:11:26,043 --> 00:11:27,911
serious short-term memory loss.

00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:28,945
Probably Alzheimer's.

00:11:29,012 --> 00:11:31,882
I called up
Social Services.

00:11:31,948 --> 00:11:33,950
They're coming out here
to do an evaluation.

00:11:34,017 --> 00:11:35,285
What do you got?

00:11:35,352 --> 00:11:38,622
Well, it's not at all
what I expected.

00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:40,424
Heidegger, Nietzsche.

00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,993
Seems like he was whip smart.

00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,162
And fascinated
with killing.

00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:49,966
The mural that the guys found
in the storm drain,

00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:51,735
it's definitely this kid's work.

00:11:51,802 --> 00:11:55,138
Well, Hitler started
as a painter, too.

00:11:56,673 --> 00:11:59,676
Bones fractured
and never properly reset.

00:11:59,743 --> 00:12:02,979
This young man's body was
a road map

00:12:03,046 --> 00:12:04,748
of violence inflicted
and meted out.

00:12:04,815 --> 00:12:08,352
ROBBINS:
Live fast, die you, and leave
a not-so-good-looking corpse.

00:12:08,418 --> 00:12:09,886
Prelim tox is in.

00:12:09,953 --> 00:12:11,922
Sean Becker was clean.

00:12:11,988 --> 00:12:13,824
If he was into drugs,

00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,359
he wasn't high the
night he drowned.

00:12:15,425 --> 00:12:16,460
He didn't drown.

00:12:18,095 --> 00:12:20,430
No foam cone, perinasal sinuses

00:12:20,497 --> 00:12:22,432
are negative
for water.

00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:24,167
Then what killed him?

00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:27,204
I knew you would ask that.

00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,573
Take a look.

00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:33,310
One of the exterior puncture
wounds extended into the lung.

00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,512
The size of the clot
suggests

00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:38,882
roughly two liters
of blood loss.

00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,352
That's definitely
the C.O.D.

00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:51,361
Wound is cylindrical,

00:12:51,428 --> 00:12:52,596
roughly three inches deep

00:12:52,663 --> 00:12:54,831
and about an eighth
of an inch wide.

00:12:54,898 --> 00:12:56,533
LANGSTON:
X marks the spot.

00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,769
My guess would be
Phillips-head screwdriver?

00:12:58,835 --> 00:12:59,803
Mine, too.

00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,038
A racist gets stabbed

00:13:01,104 --> 00:13:04,041
before he can drown.

00:13:04,107 --> 00:13:06,243
A lot of people would call
that justice.

00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:08,979
We still have to call it murder.

00:13:11,453 --> 00:13:13,411
SANDERS:
Didn't you say were going

00:13:13,477 --> 00:13:14,812
to keep checking
these access points

00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,281
until we found
something?

00:13:17,348 --> 00:13:20,051
Till we found
something <i>useful,</i> yeah.

00:13:20,117 --> 00:13:23,120
Well, I think
this qualifies.

00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:31,729
Same color fibers
as the vic's jacket.

00:13:31,796 --> 00:13:34,065
I think this might
be the dump site.

00:13:34,131 --> 00:13:36,100
(thunder crashing)

00:13:42,373 --> 00:13:44,075
My turn, right?

00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:45,910
Yeah, your turn.

00:13:45,977 --> 00:13:47,645
Okay.

00:13:49,447 --> 00:13:51,015
(grunts)

00:14:12,103 --> 00:14:14,372
Well, what do you know?
(laughs)

00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:16,340
Langston said we might be

00:14:16,407 --> 00:14:17,909
looking for one
of these.

00:14:17,975 --> 00:14:20,411
Killer must have dropped
it in with the body.

00:14:20,478 --> 00:14:25,550
Kid washes downstream,
weapon sinks and gets caught up.

00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:27,752
I think we got lucky here,
buddy.

00:14:27,818 --> 00:14:29,687
Yeah, kinda.

00:14:29,754 --> 00:14:33,090
That thing's been sitting in
rushing storm water.

00:14:33,157 --> 00:14:37,295
We'll be lucky if we get DNA
or prints.

00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:40,398
Ah, I'm an optimist.
(chuckles)

00:15:06,457 --> 00:15:08,693
♪ ♪

00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:18,269
That's quite
a road map.

00:15:20,438 --> 00:15:23,741
It's a lot violence
for such a short life.

00:15:23,808 --> 00:15:25,443
Some people turn
their anger inward:

00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,212
depression,
self-mutilation, suicide.

00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,648
Sean Becker tended
to turn his outward.

00:15:30,715 --> 00:15:33,150
Now, based on
the bruise coloration,

00:15:33,217 --> 00:15:35,520
the most recently sustained
injuries,

00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:39,490
before the night of the murder,
are these: displaced knee,

00:15:39,557 --> 00:15:43,461
torso and facial bruising

00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:45,897
approximately three days
earlier.

00:15:53,938 --> 00:15:56,040
The high school sent us
his disciplinary files.

00:15:56,107 --> 00:15:57,742
Something stood out.

00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:03,548
Hmm, fight at school three days
ago with another student:

00:16:03,614 --> 00:16:04,849
Ian Wentworth.

00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,418
So you think what started there

00:16:07,485 --> 00:16:09,887
ended with a screwdriver
to Sean Becker's lung?

00:16:09,954 --> 00:16:12,690

This is a play
about the last days

00:17:13,284 --> 00:17:16,454
before the end of the world!

00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:23,494
The song is a romantic dream
of a pure and orderly future

00:17:23,561 --> 00:17:26,864
purged of the filth
and decadence

00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:30,434
represented by the cabaret life.

00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:32,670
It is a song sung
by beautiful children

00:17:32,737 --> 00:17:35,673
who will soon turn
into monsters,

00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,242
leaving corpses spread
across the length

00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:40,545
and breadth of Europe!

00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:43,848
Next time you're going to do it

00:17:43,915 --> 00:17:46,384
like you got genocide
on your minds.

00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,919
Take five.

00:17:49,253 --> 00:17:50,521
Ben?

00:17:50,588 --> 00:17:52,490
Catherine, nice to see you.

00:17:52,557 --> 00:17:54,659
Lindsey, your,

00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:55,660
uh, mother's here.

00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:57,628
Oh, actually,
I'm here

00:17:57,695 --> 00:17:58,629
in an official capacity.

00:17:58,696 --> 00:18:00,064
I need to see Ian Wentworth.

00:18:00,131 --> 00:18:01,732
It's about Sean Becker.

00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,634
Why am I not surprised?

00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:04,969
I'll get him.

00:18:05,036 --> 00:18:06,170
Mom, what's going on?

00:18:06,237 --> 00:18:07,672
Ian couldn't have
had anything to do

00:18:07,738 --> 00:18:08,873
with Sean's death.
Linds...

00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,007
I know Ian.

00:18:10,074 --> 00:18:11,976
Are you giving me information
or your opinion?

00:18:12,043 --> 00:18:14,212
This is business.

00:18:14,278 --> 00:18:15,479
Stay out of it.

00:18:15,546 --> 00:18:18,015
Fine.

00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:22,987
Three days ago,
you got

00:18:23,054 --> 00:18:24,255
into a fight
with Sean Becker.

00:18:24,322 --> 00:18:25,523
What happened?

00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,859
It wasn't much of a fight.

00:18:27,925 --> 00:18:29,794
Okay.
<i>I'm sure he was there</i>

00:18:29,861 --> 00:18:32,830
<i>planning some kind of mayhem</i>
<i>to ruin the play:</i>

00:18:32,897 --> 00:18:35,833
<i>tomatoes or hand grenades.</i>

00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,669
<i>With someone like that,</i>
<i>who knows?</i>

00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:42,073
<i>I just wanted</i>
<i>to put him on notice.</i>

00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:43,341
What are you
doing here?

00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:44,342
Nothing.

00:18:44,408 --> 00:18:45,576
Just checking out
the play.

00:18:45,643 --> 00:18:46,944
Yeah, right.

00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,015
Get the hell out
of my way.

00:18:51,082 --> 00:18:53,584
What are you
looking for, fear?

00:18:53,651 --> 00:18:55,019
Like what you saw
in Billy Tinker

00:18:55,086 --> 00:18:56,187
when you got him
in your headlights?

00:18:56,254 --> 00:18:57,989
Screw you!

00:18:58,055 --> 00:18:59,724
(both grunting)

00:19:03,895 --> 00:19:06,197
You like bashing gays?!

00:19:06,264 --> 00:19:08,065
Well, I fight back!

00:19:10,468 --> 00:19:12,503
WILLOWS:
<i>In other words, you started it.</i>

00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,871
Sean threw
the first punch.

00:19:13,938 --> 00:19:15,239
I defended myself

00:19:15,306 --> 00:19:18,576
in a way I'm sure he thought
I couldn't.

00:19:18,643 --> 00:19:21,078
I... I'm not gonna lie
to you, Miss Willows.

00:19:21,145 --> 00:19:22,413
I'm glad he's dead.

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,917
It's like someone
finally gave him

00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:29,420
the lifetime achievement award
he so richly deserved.

00:19:29,487 --> 00:19:31,956
But I didn't
kill him.

00:19:32,023 --> 00:19:35,459
I was in dress rehearsal that
night with about 50 other people

00:19:35,526 --> 00:19:36,928
who'll swear to it...

00:19:36,994 --> 00:19:38,729
including Lindsey.

00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:45,369
STOKES:
<i>A common Phillips-head</i>
<i>screwdriver</i>

00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:47,638
with a cracked wooden handle.

00:19:47,705 --> 00:19:50,608
Available at over a hundred
hardware stores in town.

00:19:50,675 --> 00:19:52,443
It's consistent
with the shape
of the wound.

00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,978
Yeah, but unfortunately,
we didn't recover

00:19:54,045 --> 00:19:55,479
any blood or prints
off of it.

00:19:55,546 --> 00:19:56,914
I swabbed for epithelials.

00:19:56,981 --> 00:19:58,549
We're still waiting for DNA.

00:19:58,616 --> 00:20:00,618
Take a look at these bruises
on his torso and his face.

00:20:00,685 --> 00:20:03,087
They're more
than three days old.

00:20:03,154 --> 00:20:04,155
Yellowish brown.

00:20:04,222 --> 00:20:05,389
That's seven-
to ten-days old.

00:20:05,456 --> 00:20:07,625
Maybe they were
from the same altercation.

00:20:07,692 --> 00:20:08,960
That's what
I'm thinking.

00:20:09,026 --> 00:20:13,197
This fracture of the ulna
would have hurt like hell.

00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:17,435
(gasping)

00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:19,604
You'd think he would have
at least gone to an ER,

00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:20,771
had it checked out.

00:20:20,838 --> 00:20:22,406
There's nothing in
his medical records.

00:20:22,473 --> 00:20:25,176
There's nothing
in the school file.

00:20:25,243 --> 00:20:27,445
Someone did this to him.

00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:31,382
Phil?

00:20:31,449 --> 00:20:32,483
Hey, Catherine.

00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,885
What are you
doing here?

00:20:33,951 --> 00:20:36,420
Just something
I realized

00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:38,489
I probably should have
mentioned before.

00:20:38,556 --> 00:20:40,892
What's on your mind, Phil?

00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,529
Well, uh... (chuckles)

00:20:44,595 --> 00:20:46,631
I guess this is
what it feels like

00:20:46,697 --> 00:20:49,000
when I call someone
into <i>my</i> office.

00:20:49,066 --> 00:20:50,668
Phil, this is a homicide
investigation.

00:20:50,735 --> 00:20:52,703
If you know something...

00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:57,508
Uh... someone roughed up
the school janitor last week.

00:20:57,575 --> 00:20:59,777
He came in one morning
bruised and limping.

00:20:59,844 --> 00:21:01,445
Did he say it was Sean Becker?

00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:02,980
I asked him.
He wouldn't say,

00:21:03,047 --> 00:21:05,116
but I...
I knew it in my gut.

00:21:05,183 --> 00:21:07,351
Sean and his crew
had been on a real tear.

00:21:07,418 --> 00:21:10,688
Why didn't this janitor
file a police report?

00:21:10,755 --> 00:21:13,291
Laurent Senyabou's
a very private man.

00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:16,194
He didn't want to invite
any more trouble.

00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,330
Lord knows, he's seen enough
of it to last several lifetimes.

00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,534
Excuse me.

00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:26,370
Laurent Senyabou?

00:21:26,437 --> 00:21:27,805
Ye-yes?

00:21:27,872 --> 00:21:30,274
I'm Detective Jim Brass,
Las Vegas Police.

00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:32,243
I'd like to ask you
some questions about

00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,845
the alleged assault
last week.

00:21:34,912 --> 00:21:36,380
Please, I'd rather not.

00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:39,383
You seem nervous.
Are you okay?

00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,887
Where I come from,
the government and the police

00:21:42,954 --> 00:21:45,056
are not forces with which
one wishes to get involved.

00:21:45,122 --> 00:21:47,258
Please, I am okay.

00:21:47,325 --> 00:21:49,660
Now if you don't mind, I have
a lot of work to finish.

00:21:49,727 --> 00:21:50,728
No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:21:50,795 --> 00:21:52,964
Laurent, look,
in this country,

00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,465
the police protect
their citizens.

00:21:54,532 --> 00:21:57,268
So I can't do my job
unless you help me.

00:21:57,335 --> 00:21:59,237
Did Sean Becker
assault you?

00:21:59,303 --> 00:22:00,238
No.

00:22:00,304 --> 00:22:01,939
You don't understand.

00:22:02,006 --> 00:22:05,076
When I heard about his death,
it saddened me.

00:22:05,142 --> 00:22:06,477
Well, that's a first.

00:22:06,544 --> 00:22:08,679
So far, you're the only one.

00:22:12,577 --> 00:22:15,480
<i>It is true. Sean was there</i>
<i>when I was attacked.</i>

00:22:15,547 --> 00:22:16,982
(chuckles):
Oh, no!

00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:19,484
<i>But he was</i> not <i>the one</i>
<i>who attacked me.</i>

00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:21,053
S'up, homie?

00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,487
How you doing, huh?!

00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:25,857
Oh, come on, you little monkey.

00:22:25,924 --> 00:22:26,992
Hey, hey, hey.
(punch lands, groans)

00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:28,126
Come on, boy.

00:22:28,193 --> 00:22:30,395
(yelling)

00:22:33,865 --> 00:22:37,135
Sean Becker was
a stone-cold racist

00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:38,236
with a history of violence.

00:22:38,303 --> 00:22:39,971
I mean, why would
a kid like that

00:22:40,038 --> 00:22:42,607
put himself
on the line for you?

00:22:42,674 --> 00:22:44,443
We had become friends.

00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:47,679
That's a tough one
for me to understand, you know.

00:22:47,746 --> 00:22:49,915
It's no secret I
survived the genocide

00:22:49,981 --> 00:22:51,950
in my home country
of Rwanda.

00:22:52,017 --> 00:22:54,686
An event as meaningless
to most students here

00:22:54,753 --> 00:22:58,190
as... Latin is to a bush hog.

00:22:58,256 --> 00:23:01,460
<i>But one day,</i>
<i>Sean showed up at my door.</i>

00:23:01,526 --> 00:23:03,161
Hey.

00:23:03,228 --> 00:23:04,463
What do you want?

00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:06,231
I want to know more.

00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:07,833
About what?

00:23:09,868 --> 00:23:11,136
You.

00:23:11,203 --> 00:23:12,137
Your life.

00:23:12,204 --> 00:23:13,138
<i>I admit,</i>

00:23:13,205 --> 00:23:15,040
he frightened me at first.

00:23:15,107 --> 00:23:17,309
He had a reputation for cruelty.

00:23:17,376 --> 00:23:20,679
But I soon realized
Sean Becker

00:23:20,746 --> 00:23:22,581
was a truly
intelligent young man.

00:23:22,647 --> 00:23:25,016
He could see
that the future

00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:26,752
which awaited him
would be bleak

00:23:26,818 --> 00:23:30,055
unless he learned to contain
the anger which consumed him.

00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:33,658
So I told him about
what I had experienced.

00:23:33,725 --> 00:23:35,794
In my town
of Gitambo,

00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:38,463
the entire village
took refuge in a church

00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:41,867
because we knew the next
morning we would be killed.

00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:44,870
So we sent an envoy with
a letter to our priest,

00:23:44,936 --> 00:23:48,173
begging him to intercede
with the authorities,

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,242
to spare our lives.

00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:56,648
The envoy returned
with the letter, stating only,

00:23:56,715 --> 00:23:59,551
"Get your spiritual affairs
in order.

00:23:59,618 --> 00:24:01,820
God wants
you to die."

00:24:06,525 --> 00:24:07,893
What did you do?

00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:11,897
We prayed and awaited the end.

00:24:11,963 --> 00:24:15,700
Why didn't you pick up a knife
or a club and strike back?

00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:17,269
We had no weapons...

00:24:17,335 --> 00:24:19,704
Then you should have gouged out
their eyes with your fingers!

00:24:19,771 --> 00:24:21,973
You should have ripped out
their throats with your teeth.

00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,276
It would've made no difference.

00:24:24,342 --> 00:24:28,280
<i>I told him about</i>
<i>how hatred begets only hatred,</i>

00:24:28,346 --> 00:24:31,383
and that, in the end,
all one is left with

00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,387
is loss, diminishment
and death.

00:24:35,454 --> 00:24:39,257
The next morning,
the Hutu militia

00:24:39,324 --> 00:24:41,760
tossed grenades
into the church.

00:24:41,827 --> 00:24:44,863
Those who could fled outside,

00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:48,967
but only to be hacked with
machetes and left to die slowly.

00:24:49,034 --> 00:24:52,270
Some, myself included,

00:24:52,337 --> 00:24:54,973
slipped into a
forest and escaped.

00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,944
But I never saw my family again.

00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:03,515
<i>He came around often</i>
<i>after that, always in secret.</i>

00:25:03,582 --> 00:25:06,351
And we discussed
many things.

00:25:06,418 --> 00:25:09,855
Is that a picture
of you and your family?

00:25:09,921 --> 00:25:11,390
You know, God works

00:25:11,456 --> 00:25:13,458
in mysterious ways,
Detective Brass.

00:25:13,525 --> 00:25:17,462
In Rwanda,
he took everything from me.

00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:21,333
But in my new country,
he granted me a new family.

00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:24,703
Do you recognize them?

00:25:27,906 --> 00:25:32,144
They were my sisters.

00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,678
This is Eliane.

00:25:33,745 --> 00:25:35,614
She was studying
to become a nurse.

00:25:37,282 --> 00:25:40,385
And this is
Grace, the baby.

00:25:40,452 --> 00:25:42,721
Silly girl.

00:25:42,788 --> 00:25:44,656
She was always laughing
for reasons

00:25:44,723 --> 00:25:45,690
known only to herself.

00:25:45,757 --> 00:25:47,259
(both chuckle)

00:25:47,325 --> 00:25:49,061
<i>I think perhaps</i>
<i>he had fallen a bit</i>

00:25:49,127 --> 00:25:50,662
<i>in love with them.</i>

00:25:50,729 --> 00:25:54,666
He asked me if he could
copy the photo.

00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:56,968
I didn't see why not.

00:25:57,035 --> 00:26:00,038
Do you think Sean's friends knew
about your friendship with him?

00:26:00,105 --> 00:26:02,974
I don't know.

00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:07,579
But if so, it would have been
very dangerous for Sean.

00:26:14,786 --> 00:26:16,722
The big dumb one's
Daryl Johnson.

00:26:16,788 --> 00:26:18,390
Little dumb one's
Karl Hart.

00:26:18,457 --> 00:26:19,391
They look wasted.

00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:20,525
Found them
huffing spray paint,

00:26:20,592 --> 00:26:22,294
Green Valley Park,

00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,795
with the girl.

00:26:23,862 --> 00:26:25,363
Well, my guys are waiting
in the rooms for them.

00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,133
Let's go, big boy.

00:26:33,572 --> 00:26:36,708
Okay. You don't have to talk
if you don't want to.

00:26:36,775 --> 00:26:39,644
But if you're smart,

00:26:39,711 --> 00:26:43,115
you will write down everything
that happened that night.

00:26:43,181 --> 00:26:45,083
In your own words.

00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,886
So at least we have
your side of the story.

00:27:03,135 --> 00:27:04,736
You want a layer?

00:27:04,803 --> 00:27:06,371
It says "lawyer," dude.

00:27:06,438 --> 00:27:09,074
Don't you know
how to read?

00:27:09,141 --> 00:27:11,910
So I hear that gold
gives you the best buzz.

00:27:11,977 --> 00:27:13,345
Is that right?

00:27:13,412 --> 00:27:17,482
Yeah, nothing but
the best for us, bro.

00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:20,152
So why don't you tell me
about the altercation that you

00:27:20,218 --> 00:27:22,254
and Karl and Sean
Becker got into

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,322
with the school
janitor last week.

00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:25,590
Oh, right.

00:27:25,657 --> 00:27:27,659
That.

00:27:30,062 --> 00:27:33,999
Uh... Sean and Karl,

00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:35,967
they were gonna kick this, um,

00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:38,236
uh...

00:27:38,303 --> 00:27:41,840
African-American dude's ass.

00:27:41,907 --> 00:27:46,144
But then I stepped in
and said, you know,

00:27:46,211 --> 00:27:49,047
"Seeing as this is
Tolerance Week and all,

00:27:49,114 --> 00:27:52,617
why don't we try a little
tolerance for a change?"

00:27:52,684 --> 00:27:54,052
You know?

00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:57,022
"Try and see things from the
point of view of the brother."

00:27:57,089 --> 00:27:58,023
Right?

00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:01,293
But they just kept on
wailing on him.

00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:03,028
So, I mean...

00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,599
The janitor says that you were
the one that attacked him.

00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:10,035
(chuckles)

00:28:10,102 --> 00:28:14,539
Those banana-eaters
can't tell white people apart.

00:28:14,606 --> 00:28:17,042
I'm gonna kick his ass
when I get out of here.

00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:20,212
Well, you're not going
anywhere just yet, tough guy.

00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:21,847
When I cut your
friends a deal

00:28:21,913 --> 00:28:25,484
and they flip on you,
which they will,

00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,952
you're gonna find
yourself locked up

00:28:27,018 --> 00:28:29,521
in the county
jail for assault.

00:28:29,588 --> 00:28:31,857
But you know what,
I'm gonna do you a favor,

00:28:31,923 --> 00:28:35,227
since you like to
whup so much ass.

00:28:35,293 --> 00:28:36,895
I'm gonna have
the warden put you in

00:28:36,962 --> 00:28:39,598
with some African-Americans
so that they can give you

00:28:39,664 --> 00:28:42,334
an up-close and personal
lesson on race relations.

00:28:46,371 --> 00:28:48,974
I saw you there that night
outside the storm drain, Molly.

00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,343
If you know anything about
what happened to Sean,

00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:52,744
you need to tell me.

00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,415
I killed Sean.

00:28:56,481 --> 00:28:57,649
What do you mean?

00:28:57,716 --> 00:28:58,650
Sean had been acting

00:28:58,717 --> 00:29:00,118
weird lately.

00:29:00,185 --> 00:29:01,553
He was pulling away from me,

00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,921
disappearing a lot.

00:29:02,988 --> 00:29:04,723
I thought he was cheating on me.

00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,058
So I followed him.

00:29:06,124 --> 00:29:07,359
NARRATOR (over TV):
Ten years ago,

00:29:07,426 --> 00:29:10,429
in the small East African
country of Rwanda,

00:29:10,495 --> 00:29:14,166
800,000 people were slaughtered
by their own government.

00:29:14,232 --> 00:29:17,035
Virtually the entire world
turned away.

00:29:17,102 --> 00:29:18,670
<i>It was so weird.</i>

00:29:18,737 --> 00:29:22,607
He was being so secretive.

00:29:22,674 --> 00:29:25,377
So I followed him again
the next day.

00:29:25,444 --> 00:29:28,313
<i>And it got even weirder.</i>

00:29:30,615 --> 00:29:34,586
<i>That janitor was,</i>
<i>like, touching him.</i>

00:29:35,587 --> 00:29:38,223
I had this just sick feeling

00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,926
that Sean was, like, getting
it on with the colored guy.

00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,361
I told Daryl and Karl,

00:29:43,428 --> 00:29:45,230
and they didn't believe me.

00:29:47,232 --> 00:29:51,136
So they decided to test
Sean's loyalty.

00:29:51,203 --> 00:29:52,771
What's going
on, little man?

00:29:52,838 --> 00:29:54,506
How you doing, huh?!
Hey, hey, hey.

00:29:54,573 --> 00:29:56,208
Let's blow, man.
This guy ain't worth it.

00:29:56,274 --> 00:29:57,642
Hey, chillax, bro.
We're just trying

00:29:57,709 --> 00:29:59,578
to have a good time,
all right? Aren't we?

00:29:59,644 --> 00:30:00,479
SEAN:
Hey, hey.

00:30:00,545 --> 00:30:02,781
I said cut it out, bro.

00:30:02,848 --> 00:30:03,882
This guy mops
the floors,

00:30:03,949 --> 00:30:05,484
cleans the toilets.

00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,119
He's one Negro
who knows his place.

00:30:07,185 --> 00:30:08,687
Let's go.

00:30:10,522 --> 00:30:12,824
(yelling)

00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:20,665
(yells)

00:30:24,035 --> 00:30:25,370
(groans)

00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:29,307
Don't think, Daryl!

a race traitor.

the two dummies

00:30:52,831 --> 00:30:54,833
ended up killing
Sean in retribution,

00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,802
we're not getting
anything out of them.

00:30:56,868 --> 00:30:58,036
They both "layered up."

00:30:59,237 --> 00:31:01,273
Well, they all had access
to the storm drain

00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:03,008
where the body
was found.

00:31:03,075 --> 00:31:04,309
And no surprise,
the murder weapon

00:31:04,376 --> 00:31:06,411
came back negative
for epithelials.

00:31:06,478 --> 00:31:07,679
So much for optimism.

00:31:07,746 --> 00:31:10,048

I do believe that
the body evidence

00:31:10,115 --> 00:31:11,983
corroborates
the janitor's statement.

00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,052
Sean was protecting him.

00:31:15,954 --> 00:31:17,622
The facial bruising
is consistent

00:31:17,689 --> 00:31:19,658
with Daryl's blow
to Sean's mouth.

00:31:21,626 --> 00:31:24,362
The ulnar fracture is
a classic defensive wound.

00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:28,734
Sean warding off
Daryl's attack.

00:31:30,402 --> 00:31:31,703
(screams)

00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:34,306
Sounds like Sean was really
trying to change his life.

00:31:34,372 --> 00:31:36,375
Probably what got him killed.

00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:39,511
It's always easier
to, uh, embrace hatred

00:31:39,578 --> 00:31:41,179
than it is
to leave it behind.

00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:43,181
And we still don't have
a shred of evidence

00:31:43,248 --> 00:31:44,516

00:32:15,747 --> 00:32:16,782
Something wrong?

Not really.

a really rough life.

So?

00:32:41,506 --> 00:32:42,474

accessing fingerprint databases?

00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:49,147
Why? You want to know
if you're already in the system?

00:32:51,149 --> 00:32:53,785
Why would Sean be interested
in fingerprints?

00:32:53,852 --> 00:32:55,087
He was hitting on me.

00:32:55,153 --> 00:32:56,254
Obviously.

00:32:56,321 --> 00:32:59,091

God to forgive me,

this one soul,

00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:05,795
I could save a part
of myself as well.

00:41:08,597 --> 00:41:12,234
I never meant to hurt him.

lucky is the man
