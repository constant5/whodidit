I didn't get
a window seat,

00:02:54,616 --> 00:02:56,251

when the police confiscated
my belongings,

00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,010
they took something from my
dresser drawer, top right.

00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:58,413
You'll find it in evidence.

00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,648
Oh, I'm sure you've got
boxes and boxes...

00:04:00,715 --> 00:04:03,351

evidence out of storage,

00:04:03,418 --> 00:04:05,053

didn't realize its significance,

00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:12,427
and frankly, when I was
given this beautiful gift...

00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:15,230
I didn't, either.

00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,866
I felt, at the time,
it was more like a...

00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:21,703
promise.

00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:25,039
A talisman from
a like-minded soul.

00:04:26,674 --> 00:04:29,344
But...

00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,113
given recent events, uh...

00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,550
<i>I kept it in</i>
<i>a beautiful lacquer box,</i>

00:04:35,617 --> 00:04:37,752

I do have a weakness
for embellishment.

00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,342
I think I got it.

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,734
Pasta?

00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:28,536

Mm-hmm.

But that's what

00:06:42,788 --> 00:06:45,257

I'm the Dick and
Jane Killer.

00:07:18,657 --> 00:07:19,858
Kind of makes me sound

00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:22,795
so... immature.

00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:24,129
How do you know Jekyll?

00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:26,432
Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde?

00:07:26,498 --> 00:07:28,567
Do you guys even read?

00:07:28,634 --> 00:07:30,669
Robert Louis Stevenson? Hello?

00:07:30,736 --> 00:07:33,105
Jekyll was the good guy?
Well, why don't you

00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:35,040
be the good guy
and give us a name?

00:07:39,345 --> 00:07:42,414
Well... since you ask,

00:07:42,481 --> 00:07:44,483
I met him in a restaurant.

00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,686
<i>All of his victims were there.</i>

00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:50,956
<i>Before he</i> was <i>Jekyll,</i>
<i>of course.</i>

00:07:51,023 --> 00:07:53,092
<i>That was, oh...</i>

00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:55,527
<i>heavens, ten, no...</i>

00:07:55,594 --> 00:07:59,398
<i>11 years ago.</i>
(chuckles)

00:07:59,465 --> 00:08:00,833
<i>My, how time crawls.</i>

00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,636
<i>He hadn't discovered his...</i>

00:08:03,702 --> 00:08:06,572
<i>potential yet, back then,</i>

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,508
<i>back when I was free to be me.</i>

00:08:09,575 --> 00:08:14,380
<i>It was so... unexpected.</i>

00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,353
<i>So captivating.</i>

00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,456
I knew there was
genius behind it.

00:08:24,523 --> 00:08:26,025
Come on-- pasta?

00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:29,395
I asked if I could
meet the chef.

00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,798
What do you call this?

00:08:32,865 --> 00:08:34,400
I'll take it back
if you like.

00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:36,602
No, no, I like it,
I like it a lot.

00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,971
You're very talented. Sit.

00:08:40,272 --> 00:08:44,143
<i>I spoke to him.</i>
<i>I liked him, Dr. Langston.</i>

00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:45,644
<i>He was mad as a hatter.</i>

00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:47,379
What is that mess?

00:08:47,446 --> 00:08:49,515
What's the matter
with you?

00:08:49,582 --> 00:08:51,784
Nobody wants to see that crap
floating in their food.

00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,652
Get back in
the kitchen.

00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:55,988
Excuse me.
I'm sorry if he
bothered you, sir.

00:08:56,055 --> 00:08:57,323
I'll get you another
plate of pasta.

00:08:57,389 --> 00:08:58,757
This is good.
I'll keep this...

00:08:58,824 --> 00:09:00,559
No, please, let me
get some more pasta...
Leave it!

00:09:00,626 --> 00:09:02,695
<i>Dr. Langston,</i>

00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:05,631
choosing a partner--
it's intuitive.

00:09:05,698 --> 00:09:09,168
It comes from a place
deep inside of you.

00:09:09,235 --> 00:09:10,236
What, like your colon?

00:09:10,302 --> 00:09:12,371
Could we get a private room?

00:09:12,438 --> 00:09:14,406
There's a fly buzzing in here.

00:09:14,473 --> 00:09:16,709
Take this psychopath,
send him back to Hell

00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:18,210
and throw away the key.
Jim...

00:09:18,277 --> 00:09:19,878
(imitates a fly buzzing)

00:09:19,945 --> 00:09:21,513
Could I have a few
minutes with him?

00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,015
BRASS: Take all the
time you want.

00:09:27,686 --> 00:09:30,022
(angry sigh)

00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:32,024
Nice bad-cop routine.

00:09:32,091 --> 00:09:34,126
Yeah, well,
I wasn't acting.

00:09:34,193 --> 00:09:35,895
I need a name.

00:09:35,961 --> 00:09:38,864
And I'm just so bad with names.

00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:43,869
I did talk to him,
though, Dr. Langston.

00:09:43,936 --> 00:09:45,938
And he opened up to me.

00:09:46,005 --> 00:09:47,940
The right ones
always do.

00:09:48,007 --> 00:09:49,975
He's a late bloomer,

00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:51,610
but...

00:09:51,677 --> 00:09:55,047
he seems to be making
quite a splash now.

00:09:55,114 --> 00:09:56,882
What was the name
of the restaurant?

00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:59,084
All this food talk is
making me so hungry.

00:09:59,151 --> 00:10:02,121
I wonder whether a nice steak
dinner would jog my memory.

00:10:02,187 --> 00:10:03,455
I'll have the rib eye,

00:10:03,522 --> 00:10:06,592
(over speaker):
rare, baked potato, sour cream,

00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:08,294
chives; for dessert,
berry pie--

00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,496
if it's in season--
and I'll have it á la mode.

00:10:10,563 --> 00:10:13,098
If you want to get something...

00:10:13,165 --> 00:10:15,467
you have to give me something.

00:10:16,902 --> 00:10:19,471
(whispers):
Let's be perfectly clear--

00:10:19,538 --> 00:10:23,075
you need me,
and I need you.

00:10:23,142 --> 00:10:27,179
I'm gonna die in prison,
so I'm gonna have some fun.

00:10:27,246 --> 00:10:30,049
If you don't like it,
send me back to Ely.

00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,386
Let the good doctor
continue his work.

00:10:34,453 --> 00:10:36,488
I want my steak bloody.

00:10:36,555 --> 00:10:38,457
So, the sheriff
has given us 48 hours,

00:10:38,524 --> 00:10:39,959
then he ships Haskell back.

00:10:40,025 --> 00:10:41,961
Haskell said he was
in a restaurant

00:10:42,027 --> 00:10:44,496
that serves pasta
with a piano bar.

00:10:44,563 --> 00:10:46,565
Jekyll was there, so were
three of his victims.

00:10:46,632 --> 00:10:49,268
All in the same place
at the same time.
Oh, that's convenient.

00:10:49,335 --> 00:10:50,336
I don't believe it.

00:10:50,402 --> 00:10:51,770
He's lying for fresh air.

00:10:51,837 --> 00:10:53,739
Yeah. But there is the pasta.

00:10:53,806 --> 00:10:55,507
Haskell's not a magician,
right, and we had that

00:10:55,574 --> 00:10:56,909
in evidence way before

00:10:56,976 --> 00:10:58,944
Joey Bigelow's surgery.
He likes to mix

00:10:59,011 --> 00:11:01,247
the truth with lies.
Let's run down
this restaurant--

00:11:01,313 --> 00:11:03,048
if it exists--
see which is which.

00:11:03,115 --> 00:11:06,118
Joey Bigelow may have been
playing some gigs back then,

00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:08,487
so there could be tax records,
pay stubs...

00:11:08,554 --> 00:11:09,655
Joey had an agent.

00:11:09,722 --> 00:11:12,258
His name was, um,
Marty Felnick.

00:11:12,324 --> 00:11:13,759
I know Marty.

00:11:13,826 --> 00:11:16,929
I sat on his lap a few times,
back in the day.

00:11:16,996 --> 00:11:18,664
When you were a little girl?

00:11:18,731 --> 00:11:20,132
No, when I was a big girl.

00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:22,268
So, if he's
still alive,

00:11:22,334 --> 00:11:23,636
I'll find him.

00:11:23,702 --> 00:11:25,504
STOKES:
Okay, we should get
credit card receipts

00:11:25,571 --> 00:11:27,940
for Jekyll's victims,
see if there was an
overlap 11 years ago.

00:11:28,007 --> 00:11:30,276
I'll take Higgins.
I got Herson.

00:11:30,342 --> 00:11:32,444
And I'll call Reno PD,
get Haskell's financials.

00:11:34,046 --> 00:11:36,115
Thank you.

00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:38,450
Mr. Felnick?

00:11:39,685 --> 00:11:41,220
I'm Catherine Willows.

00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:43,088
I'm with the crime lab.

00:11:43,155 --> 00:11:45,457
I was wondering
when you guys would show up.

00:11:45,524 --> 00:11:46,792
Hmm.

00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:48,694
This is about Joe-Joe, right?

00:11:48,761 --> 00:11:51,997
Yes. Yes, sir, it is.

00:11:52,064 --> 00:11:54,700
I heard that you were with him
from the beginning.

00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:57,036
From before the beginning,
young lady.

00:11:57,102 --> 00:11:59,838
Now it's after the end,
isn't it?

00:11:59,905 --> 00:12:02,274
Whew.

00:12:02,341 --> 00:12:04,543
The man had such talent.

00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,545
He drank, though.

00:12:06,612 --> 00:12:09,615
But I mean, from the bottom
of the bottle-- he drank.

00:12:09,682 --> 00:12:12,585
Dumb bastard--
he threw it all away.

00:12:12,651 --> 00:12:16,622
Do you recall if Joey was
playing any restaurant gigs

00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:18,857
about ten or 11 years ago?

00:12:18,924 --> 00:12:20,659
You know,
you're a very attractive woman.

00:12:20,726 --> 00:12:22,194
Did anybody ever tell you that?

00:12:22,261 --> 00:12:23,362
Thank you.

00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:24,663
But one time,
I do remember

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,831
he came to me.

00:12:25,898 --> 00:12:26,999
I remember this time,

00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:29,068
he wanted me
to come see him play.

00:12:29,134 --> 00:12:30,903
It was like a comeback,
you know?

00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,340
It was only a one-night thing
in some kind of joint.

00:12:34,406 --> 00:12:36,175
He not only lost his touch...

00:12:36,242 --> 00:12:37,576
(laughs)

00:12:37,643 --> 00:12:39,578
...he stiffed me for dinner.

00:12:39,645 --> 00:12:41,180
Do you remember the name
of the place?

00:12:41,247 --> 00:12:44,883
No, but I remember
the $150 he took from me.

00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,485
(laughs)

00:12:46,552 --> 00:12:47,786
That I remember.

00:12:47,853 --> 00:12:50,389
The joint-- it was...

00:12:50,456 --> 00:12:53,859
It was west of the 15,
as driving,

00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:56,395
and south of the 95.

00:12:56,462 --> 00:12:57,796
That's where it was.

00:12:57,863 --> 00:13:00,799
Could you show me where,
on this map?

00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:02,468
You got a map?
Mm-hmm.

00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:04,103
Hm-hm!

00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:05,404
Huh.

00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:07,640
Somewhere around here.

00:13:07,706 --> 00:13:11,477
Sweetheart,
you are very familiar.

00:13:11,543 --> 00:13:13,779
We knew each other,
something.

00:13:13,846 --> 00:13:16,815
I bet you say that
to all the cops.
(laughs)

00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:21,253
Haskell's never filed
an income tax form in his life.

00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,455
He's never had a job
there's any record of.

00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:24,690
He's very smart.

00:13:24,757 --> 00:13:25,925
He made himself invisible.

00:13:25,991 --> 00:13:27,927
I talked to Marty Felnick.

00:13:27,993 --> 00:13:29,828
Joey played piano
in a restaurant

00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:32,197
in roughly the vicinity
where we found his body.

00:13:32,264 --> 00:13:33,799
I didn't get the name, though.

00:13:33,866 --> 00:13:37,570
I found this picture
in Herson's evidence.

00:13:37,636 --> 00:13:40,272
His shirt is from Venetti's.

00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:41,974
Which is on that side of town.

00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,076
Bernie Higgins ate out
breakfast, lunch and dinner.

00:13:44,143 --> 00:13:46,378
And he went to Venetti's
at least once a week.

00:13:54,653 --> 00:13:56,655
(sighs heavily)

00:14:01,594 --> 00:14:04,930
We're here.
Let's have a look around.

00:14:05,998 --> 00:14:07,233
I'll get it.

00:14:35,394 --> 00:14:36,829
What do you know?

00:14:36,896 --> 00:14:40,099
Farfalle--
homemade bow tie pasta.

00:14:43,469 --> 00:14:45,537
Found their business license.

00:14:45,604 --> 00:14:47,239
Expired five years ago.

00:14:56,448 --> 00:14:59,718
Joe-Joe Bigelow--
he's on the wall.

00:15:05,891 --> 00:15:06,926
Bernard Higgins here.

00:15:09,228 --> 00:15:11,697
STOKES:
Yeah, Herson...

00:15:11,764 --> 00:15:13,499
is here, as well.

00:15:13,566 --> 00:15:15,534
Looks like
Haskell was telling the truth.

00:15:15,601 --> 00:15:18,137
I'd like to be the one
to tell Brass.

00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,493
ANDREWS: <i>Catherine, hey,</i>
<i>I got the information</i>

00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,661
you asked for.

00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:24,029
I called the Clark
County Assessor

00:15:24,095 --> 00:15:26,231
and got the names of the
three co-owners of Venetti's.

00:15:26,298 --> 00:15:27,532
Oh, great.
I'll call them.

00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:28,700
Yeah, uh, they're dead.

00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,169
Two of them were
low-level Italian mobsters.

00:15:31,236 --> 00:15:32,437
They're brothers.

00:15:32,504 --> 00:15:34,406
Apparently, they got sent
through a wood chipper

00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:36,141
in Brime County
a few years back.

00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,309
Okay.

00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,144
The third is
a Hasidic bookie.

00:15:39,211 --> 00:15:41,046
According to Vice,
the last thing they saw

00:15:41,112 --> 00:15:43,248
of his before he vanished
were the charred remains

00:15:43,315 --> 00:15:44,649
of his bookie receipts

00:15:44,716 --> 00:15:47,919
and a yarmulke on the roof
of the, uh, Silver Vista

00:15:47,986 --> 00:15:50,555
Athletic Club.
Elroy Wax?

00:15:50,622 --> 00:15:52,691
How did you know?
My father used to
place bets with him

00:15:52,757 --> 00:15:53,859
all the time.

00:15:53,925 --> 00:15:55,427
Hell, I placed a few myself.

00:15:55,493 --> 00:15:56,728
Uncle Elroy? He's dead?

00:15:56,795 --> 00:15:57,729
Sorry.

00:15:57,796 --> 00:15:59,331
Here--
I also got a list

00:15:59,397 --> 00:16:00,999
of the restaurant's employees
from the IRS.

00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:02,434
If we're to believe Haskell,

00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,036
one of these guys
has got to be Jekyll.

00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,878
Jekyll's forehead
wasn't that big.

00:16:09,944 --> 00:16:11,880
You said bulging.

00:16:11,946 --> 00:16:13,348
I said prominent.

00:16:13,414 --> 00:16:15,216
Make it wider, flatter.

00:16:15,283 --> 00:16:16,384
Chin is too weak.

00:16:16,451 --> 00:16:18,453
Where did you learn
to draw, my dear--

00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,522
"Sketch Bambi" contest?

00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:22,056
(wry, mocking laugh)

00:16:22,123 --> 00:16:25,493
It's better, but the
eyes more wide-set,

00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,198
and jaw more square,
more patrician.

00:16:30,265 --> 00:16:33,668
Do you know what
that means? Patrician?

00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:37,939
That's perfect.

00:16:40,275 --> 00:16:41,709
Do you like it,
Dr. Langston?

00:16:41,776 --> 00:16:43,077
I made it for you.

00:16:43,144 --> 00:16:44,078
You can go.

00:16:44,145 --> 00:16:46,047
Mm.

00:16:46,114 --> 00:16:47,916
Bye, my dear.

00:16:52,253 --> 00:16:55,023
Do you, uh,
recognize this place?

00:16:56,624 --> 00:16:59,060
It looks familiar.

00:16:59,127 --> 00:17:01,563
It's come on hard
times, hasn't it?

00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:04,732
Things are so tough out there;
everybody out of work.

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,902
That's the thing about
two consecutive life sentences.

00:17:07,969 --> 00:17:09,237
Mortgage is paid.

00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:11,806
Three hots and a cot.

00:17:11,873 --> 00:17:15,143
Must be hard for you to indulge
your hobbies from inside.

00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:18,113
When you consider
Dr. Jekyll is out there,

00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:21,149
free to continue his practice.

00:17:21,216 --> 00:17:22,884
You don't get
that many opportunities

00:17:22,951 --> 00:17:25,120
to, uh, "Dick and Jane" around,

00:17:25,186 --> 00:17:26,387
do you?

00:17:26,454 --> 00:17:27,689
Mm.

00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,158
We confirmed
that all of

00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:32,760
Dr. Jekyll's victims
did visit this restaurant,

00:17:32,827 --> 00:17:34,662
this, uh, Venetti's.

00:17:34,729 --> 00:17:37,999
Venetti's.

00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:39,267
Yes.

00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:42,303
Good work, Ray.

00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:46,074
So you saw the Wall of Fame?

00:17:46,141 --> 00:17:48,910
This is working great.

00:17:48,977 --> 00:17:51,913
I give you good information,
you give me a good steak.

00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,149
I have a list
of names here, Nate.

00:17:54,215 --> 00:17:55,583
I wonder...

00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,286
if you see the young man's name
on this list?

00:18:01,322 --> 00:18:03,691
Oh, yeah, I see it.

00:18:03,758 --> 00:18:05,393
What is his name?

00:18:06,928 --> 00:18:09,264
Ray...

00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,599
you know this is
a barter system.

00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,601
You gave me good steak,

00:18:13,668 --> 00:18:16,004
I got you to the place.

00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,407
Now, I need
a little something else.

00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:24,412
(sighs)

00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,781
You know that we are
running down these names,

00:18:26,848 --> 00:18:28,183
which means that
your information

00:18:28,249 --> 00:18:29,984
won't be very valuable
for very long.

00:18:30,051 --> 00:18:33,521
Maybe long enough
for someone to die.

00:18:33,588 --> 00:18:35,323
Be careful, Doctor.

00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,326
You might be
the next victim.

00:18:38,393 --> 00:18:40,395
Is that a game you want to play?

00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:47,469
♪ ♪

00:19:05,253 --> 00:19:07,055
She's for Haskell.

00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,326
(sultry dance music
playing on boom box)

00:19:35,283 --> 00:19:36,551
That's enough,
thank you.

00:19:36,618 --> 00:19:38,319
I need a name, Nate.

00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,822
You're interrupting
a performance! It's very rude!

00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:43,792
Yes-- I need
his name, Nate.

00:19:47,428 --> 00:19:49,197
Carlo Parini.

00:19:49,264 --> 00:19:50,498
You sure?

00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:51,666
OFFICER:
Haskell, get back!

00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,235
Enjoy yourself.

00:19:56,171 --> 00:19:58,206
Carlo Parini.

00:19:58,273 --> 00:20:00,141
Let's see if we
can find this guy.

00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,643
I'm betting he's got a sheet.

00:20:01,709 --> 00:20:03,211
See? What did I tell you?

00:20:03,278 --> 00:20:04,446
Carlo Parini--

00:20:04,512 --> 00:20:06,648
he's in Ely, finishing
up a five-year stint

00:20:06,714 --> 00:20:08,149
for hit-and-run manslaughter.

00:20:08,216 --> 00:20:09,317
So, your friend Haskell

00:20:09,384 --> 00:20:11,686
has got himself
a free lap dance in jail.

00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,121
Look, Haskell

00:20:13,188 --> 00:20:14,989
is smart enough to know
that we were going

00:20:15,056 --> 00:20:16,424
to come at him
with this list.

00:20:16,491 --> 00:20:19,527
If he gives us nothing,
the game's over.

00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:20,895
He gets nothing.

00:20:20,962 --> 00:20:22,430
There's got to be
something here, Jim.

00:20:22,497 --> 00:20:24,432
He's making us work for it.

00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,438
Dr. Ray?

00:20:30,505 --> 00:20:31,673
Yes.

00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:33,441
Yeah. Uh, I accepted
a package for you.

00:20:33,508 --> 00:20:36,111
It was marked perishable, so I
put it in the lunch fridge.

00:20:36,177 --> 00:20:38,680
Thank you.
It's from a
James Langston.

00:20:38,746 --> 00:20:39,948
Is that a relative
of yours?

00:20:40,014 --> 00:20:41,116
My dad.

00:20:41,182 --> 00:20:43,118
Oh, that's nice.

00:20:43,184 --> 00:20:45,520
He's been dead for ten years.

00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:01,402
We lived in Delaware
for a while,

00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,438
when I was a kid.

00:21:03,505 --> 00:21:05,340
Maybe it's some
kind of sick joke.

00:21:05,406 --> 00:21:06,574
Or something worse.

00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:09,744
ROBBINS:
Hmm. No batteries,

00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:12,747
no switches,
no timers.

00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,616
It doesn't look
like a bomb,

00:21:14,682 --> 00:21:16,151
or any body part.

00:21:17,185 --> 00:21:19,287
LANGSTON:
Well...

00:21:19,354 --> 00:21:21,322
let's take a look.

00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,961
See what we can see.

00:21:37,272 --> 00:21:40,074
LANGSTON:
Hmm. It's my old I.D. badge.

00:21:40,141 --> 00:21:42,243
Jekyll's come out to play.

00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,478
(grunts)

00:21:55,757 --> 00:21:56,758
ROBBINS:
Whoa.

00:22:00,662 --> 00:22:02,163
Looks like homemade
beef jerky.

00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,666
Or homemade people jerky.

00:22:04,732 --> 00:22:07,235
ROBBINS:
You can't tell by looking at it.

00:22:07,302 --> 00:22:10,672
LANGSTON:
That's da Vinci's Vitruvian man.

00:22:10,738 --> 00:22:13,708
Looks to be hand-drawn,
with great precision.

00:22:13,775 --> 00:22:15,443
STOKES:
Tattooed on meat?

00:22:17,145 --> 00:22:19,114
LANGSTON:
"NAYL"?

00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,417
That's text speak
for "in a while."

00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,825
I have no idea what that is.

00:22:34,162 --> 00:22:37,499
It appears to be a propeller
of some kind.

00:22:40,335 --> 00:22:42,770
WILLOWS:
An angel.

00:22:42,837 --> 00:22:44,105
That number's a John Doe.

00:22:44,172 --> 00:22:45,740
ROBBINS:
<i>David?</i>

00:22:48,777 --> 00:22:50,712
John Does are over here.

00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:53,014
Uh, help Nick move
these bodies, would you?

00:23:10,398 --> 00:23:13,168
JD-09-1157.

00:23:13,234 --> 00:23:14,903
Day shift case.

00:23:14,969 --> 00:23:16,137
December 2, 2009.

00:23:16,204 --> 00:23:17,639
It's a typical body dump.

00:23:17,705 --> 00:23:19,607
Okay, that's a couple of
months after Joey Bigelow,

00:23:19,674 --> 00:23:21,009
and a couple of days

00:23:21,075 --> 00:23:22,577
before Bernard Higgins
was worked on.

00:23:22,644 --> 00:23:23,745
What was C.O.D.?

00:23:23,812 --> 00:23:25,780
Uh, exsanguination
due to a stab wound.

00:23:25,847 --> 00:23:26,948
Stab wound?

00:23:27,015 --> 00:23:29,150
"An unusual sharp-force injury,

00:23:29,217 --> 00:23:31,653
"wider at the entrance,
consistent with a typical,

00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:34,088
"single-edged knife wound
for the first three inches.

00:23:34,155 --> 00:23:36,090
"then extending
another three inches

00:23:36,157 --> 00:23:38,293
"is a roughly circular,
eighth-inch-diameter

00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:41,196
"wound track, which appears
to have perforated

00:23:41,262 --> 00:23:42,230
the appendicular
artery."

00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:44,065
And eighth-inch-diameter
wound that deep

00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:46,301
would be consistent...

00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:48,436
with a laparoscopic penetration.

00:23:48,503 --> 00:23:50,705
And the appendicular
artery--

00:23:50,772 --> 00:23:53,041
Jekyll surgically implanted

00:23:53,108 --> 00:23:55,310
a septic appendix
into Bernie Higgins.

00:23:55,376 --> 00:23:57,579
STOKES: <i>Maybe the appendix</i>
<i>was meant for this guy</i>

00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:58,780
<i>and Jekyll botched it.</i>

00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:00,582
<i>He knew the guy</i>
<i>was gonna bleed out,</i>

00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:04,219
<i>so he tried to cover</i>
<i>his mistake with a knife wound.</i>

00:24:04,285 --> 00:24:06,087
Why would he cover it up
back then,

00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:08,223
and hand it to us
on a platter now?

00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:09,891
Jekyll's getting
cocky, boys.

00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,893
That's good for us.

00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,061
(camera clicks)

00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:31,813
Door's been open recently.

00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:42,190
If you have a key
to the place, you could

00:24:42,257 --> 00:24:43,825
come and go
as you please.

00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:47,128
SANDERS:
Got blood.

00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:51,032
But then again,
this is

00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:52,867
where they prepared the food.

00:24:52,934 --> 00:24:54,469
I'll test it.

00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:56,271
(phone rings)

00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:37,712
Hey, Nick?

00:25:37,779 --> 00:25:41,516
I got a photo and a name:
Yuri Grishenko.

00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,084
He's with another man
who appears

00:25:43,151 --> 00:25:45,420
in a lot of the pictures
on the wall.

00:25:45,487 --> 00:25:48,523
Sara, blood on the
table's human.

00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,226
We just found
Jekyll's operating room.

00:25:53,337 --> 00:25:55,606
SANDERS:
<i>We got the DNA back from</i>
<i>the blood at the restaurant.</i>

00:25:55,672 --> 00:25:58,575
<i>Two donors:</i>
<i>Joey Bigelow and the John Doe,</i>

00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:00,677
<i>who we now know</i>
<i>as Yuri Grishenko.</i>

00:26:00,744 --> 00:26:03,680
<i>He was a Ukranian businessman,</i>
<i>made his fortune</i>

00:26:03,747 --> 00:26:05,883
<i>in gas and oil,</i>
<i>spent his winters</i>

00:26:05,949 --> 00:26:07,918
<i>in Vegas gambling.</i>
<i>No family.</i>

00:26:09,786 --> 00:26:11,388
<i>When his body was recovered,</i>

00:26:11,455 --> 00:26:13,223
<i>his passport and wallet</i>
<i>were gone.</i>

00:26:15,428 --> 00:26:17,063
<i>No one reported him missing,</i>

00:26:17,129 --> 00:26:19,732
and he fell
through the cracks.

00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:21,467
So how did Jekyll

00:26:21,534 --> 00:26:24,036
get Grishenko's
John Doe number?

00:26:24,103 --> 00:26:25,538
WILLOWS: Probably called
the Coroner's Office,

00:26:25,605 --> 00:26:28,207
used Ray's badge number
to get the information.

00:26:28,274 --> 00:26:31,544
You see that mark...
on the leg?

00:26:31,611 --> 00:26:34,313
That "X" is not a part
of da Vinci's original drawing.

00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,615
And a mark like that

00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:38,551
could imply surgical incision
through the groin.

00:26:38,618 --> 00:26:41,888
None of his previous victims
had an injury there,

00:26:41,954 --> 00:26:45,191
so this could be a present
or future victim.

00:26:45,258 --> 00:26:46,325
Right.

00:26:46,392 --> 00:26:49,562
I think that I...
saw something like this

00:26:49,629 --> 00:26:52,932
in Herson's evidence box.

00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:56,469
Like some sort of claw.

00:27:03,042 --> 00:27:04,777
This is an IVC filter.

00:27:04,844 --> 00:27:06,312
It's used to collect

00:27:06,379 --> 00:27:09,448
clotted blood
in venous thrombosis patients,

00:27:09,515 --> 00:27:11,450
and it's inserted

00:27:11,517 --> 00:27:13,819
laparoscopically
through the groin.

00:27:13,886 --> 00:27:19,850
So this... is a drawing
of an IVC filter.

00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:21,561
All right.

00:27:21,627 --> 00:27:24,397
"NAYL."

00:27:24,463 --> 00:27:27,099
No... There's...
a partial horizontal break

00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:29,468
in the stem of the "Y."

00:27:32,338 --> 00:27:33,673
"Navel"?

00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:35,675
"Navel."

00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:37,143
A pneumonic
acronym taught

00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,411
to medical students

00:27:38,477 --> 00:27:40,813
to teach them how to locate
the femoral artery.

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,450
<i>Nerve, Artery, Vein, Lymphatic.</i>

00:27:44,517 --> 00:27:46,853
<i>It's the order in which</i>
<i>these anatomical structures</i>

00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:49,322
<i>are positioned in the leg.</i>

00:27:49,388 --> 00:27:52,692
So if he meant N-A-V-L,
why did he use a "Y"?

00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:54,727
Because he's a wordsmith.

00:27:54,794 --> 00:27:58,331
He likes double entendres,
even triple entendres.

00:27:58,397 --> 00:28:01,167
The "Y" could represent

00:28:01,234 --> 00:28:03,502
the inferior vena cava, which is

00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:05,137
the large forking vein
that carries blood

00:28:05,204 --> 00:28:06,806
from the lower half of the body

00:28:06,873 --> 00:28:09,208
up into the heart,
which is typically

00:28:09,275 --> 00:28:11,010
where an IVC filter

00:28:11,077 --> 00:28:12,845
is placed.

00:28:12,912 --> 00:28:15,481
Jekyll is telling us
that "in a while"

00:28:15,548 --> 00:28:17,149
he is going to insert

00:28:17,216 --> 00:28:20,553
an IVC filter into the inferior
vena cava of his next victim.

00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,787
(Sanders sighs)

00:28:21,854 --> 00:28:24,824
So what's that propeller for?

00:28:27,293 --> 00:28:31,998
It looks...
as if it was designed to fit

00:28:32,064 --> 00:28:35,334
perfectly inside the filter.

00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:39,672
If this device was inserted
into the inferior vena cava...

00:28:39,739 --> 00:28:42,942
blood flow would cause
the propeller to turn,

00:28:43,009 --> 00:28:46,879
<i>which would cause the legs</i>
<i>of the filter itself</i>

00:28:46,946 --> 00:28:48,948
<i>to expand out, pushing against</i>

00:28:49,015 --> 00:28:50,883
the interior wall of the vein.

00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:53,252
How long could someone survive
with that thing inside them?

00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:54,687
LANGSTON:
It's hard to say,

00:28:54,754 --> 00:28:56,522
but it would work very slowly,

00:28:56,589 --> 00:28:58,858
it would create
excruciating pain,

00:28:58,925 --> 00:29:03,095
and eventually, the vein
would burst from the pressure,

00:29:03,162 --> 00:29:05,331
and the victim would die.

00:29:05,398 --> 00:29:09,435
(slowly, taunting):
♪ Barclay ♪

00:29:09,502 --> 00:29:12,271
♪ Barclay... ♪

00:29:12,338 --> 00:29:14,473
(sighs)

00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,443
♪ Barclay ♪

00:29:19,312 --> 00:29:21,447
♪ Barclay... ♪

00:29:21,514 --> 00:29:22,548
Shut up!

00:29:22,615 --> 00:29:25,651
Told you to shut the hell up.
My God!

00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:29,622
♪ Barclay ♪

00:29:30,656 --> 00:29:33,192
♪ Barclay... ♪
(annoyed sigh)

00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,962
Uh, we're just
about finished.

00:29:36,028 --> 00:29:37,530
Just give me what you got.

00:29:37,597 --> 00:29:39,799
Well, the meat is definitely
not human; it's pork.

00:29:39,866 --> 00:29:42,034
HODGES: In fact, it's
prosciutto di Parma.

00:29:42,101 --> 00:29:44,971
Common prosciutto is cured
with garlic and spices--

00:29:45,037 --> 00:29:47,573
cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg--
but prosciutto di Parma

00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,642
is cured with sea salt
and then larded

00:29:49,709 --> 00:29:51,043
and packed with cracked pepper,

00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,913
allowing for the superior flavor
of the meat to come through.

00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,383
So maybe Jekyll is moving up
in the culinary world.

00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,985
DNA?

00:29:59,051 --> 00:30:01,387
Well, there's definitely no
touch DNA-- that was negative.

00:30:01,454 --> 00:30:03,789
But because it's prosciutto,
that means it was dehydrated.

00:30:03,856 --> 00:30:05,825
And not cooked.
Right.

00:30:05,892 --> 00:30:08,160
So we think it might
still contain some
embedded epithelial DNA,

00:30:08,227 --> 00:30:10,129
if Jekyll wasn't
wearing gloves when

00:30:10,196 --> 00:30:11,864
he made the jerky
in the first place.

00:30:22,074 --> 00:30:24,310
How's it going?
Oh, we've been
cross-referencing

00:30:24,377 --> 00:30:25,811
employees from
the old restaurant

00:30:25,878 --> 00:30:28,681
with people who are
still in the industry.

00:30:28,748 --> 00:30:30,883
Well, I can narrow down the
list-- we're only interested

00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,618
in employees who are
now working at high-end

00:30:32,685 --> 00:30:35,688
Italian restaurants.
Well, we've got
a handful of those.

00:30:37,256 --> 00:30:38,624
Let's hit the streets.

00:30:56,242 --> 00:30:59,212
There's a couple
cars in the lot.

00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:01,280
Somebody's here.

00:31:17,396 --> 00:31:19,131
Excuse me, sir?

00:31:19,198 --> 00:31:21,968
Sorry, fellas,
kitchen's closed.

00:31:22,034 --> 00:31:23,903
I'm Nick Stokes.
This is Ray Langston.

00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,338
We're with
the crime lab.

00:31:25,404 --> 00:31:28,007
We'd like to ask you a few
questions, if you got a minute.

00:31:28,074 --> 00:31:30,276
Hey... it's always
an honor to help out

00:31:30,343 --> 00:31:31,611
the Las Vegas
Police Department,

00:31:31,677 --> 00:31:33,012
the greatest
in the world.

00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:35,348
I'm Giovanni.
Everybody calls me Papa.
Thank you.

00:31:35,414 --> 00:31:37,683
Have a seat.
All right, thanks.

00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,285
Papa...

00:31:39,352 --> 00:31:41,854
did you used to work at a
restaurant called Venetti's,

00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:43,422
on the north side of town?

00:31:43,489 --> 00:31:44,824
I managed the place.

00:31:44,891 --> 00:31:48,027
Worked my way up
from dishwasher.

00:31:48,094 --> 00:31:49,328
It was old-school, you know.

00:31:49,395 --> 00:31:52,198
A red sauce joint, but...

00:31:52,265 --> 00:31:55,601
a lot of great men--
important men-- ate there.

00:31:55,668 --> 00:31:57,236
Do you manage
this place?

00:31:57,303 --> 00:31:58,371
Come on.

00:31:58,437 --> 00:31:59,672
(chuckles):
I own it.

00:31:59,739 --> 00:32:01,307
DiMasa, that's me.
Papa DiMasa.

00:32:01,374 --> 00:32:03,276
Hey, how about a glass of wine?

00:32:03,342 --> 00:32:06,078
Aw, that's very
kind of you...
Come on,
come on, come on,

00:32:06,145 --> 00:32:07,246
who's gonna know?

00:32:07,313 --> 00:32:08,881
A glass of wine's
good for the heart.

00:32:08,948 --> 00:32:10,082
Hey, Charlie, yo!

00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:12,418
A good Barolo and three glasses.

00:32:12,485 --> 00:32:14,554
We're looking for all the guys
who used to work

00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,290
at Venetti's that
work here now, you
know what I mean?

00:32:17,356 --> 00:32:18,658
DiMASA:
Yeah. Oh...

00:32:18,724 --> 00:32:20,726
so this is Charlie--
he's the cook.

00:32:20,793 --> 00:32:21,827
STOKES:
Charlie.

00:32:21,894 --> 00:32:23,496
Gentlemen.

00:32:23,563 --> 00:32:25,565
Yeah, I brought
a lot of the boys.

00:32:25,631 --> 00:32:27,800
All good guys.
(gasping breaths)

00:32:27,867 --> 00:32:30,002
Are you all right?

00:32:30,069 --> 00:32:31,971
Whew! (wry laugh)
Being an owner.

00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:33,773
Lot of stress.

00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:35,308
Yeah, I'd like to take a look

00:32:35,374 --> 00:32:37,143
at your employee list,
if you don't mind.

00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:39,145
Yeah, sure.

00:32:39,212 --> 00:32:40,580
Don't get up, Dad.

00:32:40,646 --> 00:32:42,415
I'll get it.

00:32:44,383 --> 00:32:46,219
How long have you
been experiencing

00:32:46,285 --> 00:32:48,788
this pain, sir?
I don't know, a day or two.

00:32:48,855 --> 00:32:50,756
Aw, don't worry
about me, I'm fine.

00:32:50,823 --> 00:32:52,658
Do you have some kind
of heart condition?

00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:53,793
Me? Nah.

00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,828
Come on... I got
a heart like a lion,

00:32:55,895 --> 00:32:56,996
like all the DiMasa men.

00:32:57,063 --> 00:32:58,164
(gasps, groans quietly)

00:32:58,231 --> 00:32:59,432
I just... I just got to...

00:32:59,498 --> 00:33:01,200
lay off the Bolognese sauce,
you know?

00:33:01,267 --> 00:33:02,368
(phone ringing)

00:33:02,435 --> 00:33:04,437
Excuse me.

00:33:05,771 --> 00:33:07,340
Stokes.

00:33:07,406 --> 00:33:09,976
I just got the DNA results
from the meat cards.

00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:12,345
Whoever made the prosciutto
is a filial match

00:33:12,411 --> 00:33:15,581
<i>to the septic appendix</i>
<i>we found in Bernard Higgins.</i>

00:33:15,648 --> 00:33:18,718
So that appendix either belonged
to Jekyll's father or...

00:33:18,784 --> 00:33:20,119
Or his son.

00:33:20,186 --> 00:33:21,387
Thanks, Catherine.

00:33:21,454 --> 00:33:25,358
Mr. DiMasa, did you recently
have your appendix removed?

00:33:25,424 --> 00:33:27,660
What are you, a mind reader?

00:33:27,727 --> 00:33:30,463
Yeah. A couple of days
before Thanksgiving.

00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,031
(groans)
STOKES:
Go back there and see what

00:33:32,098 --> 00:33:33,299
that guy's doing.

00:33:33,366 --> 00:33:35,268
Get him out of here, Ray.

00:33:35,334 --> 00:33:37,470
Mr. DiMasa, we're gonna
take you to the hospital.

00:33:37,537 --> 00:33:39,071
It's-It's okay.
I'm-I'm a doctor.

00:33:39,138 --> 00:33:41,040
Oh... my son wanted
to be a doctor.

00:33:41,107 --> 00:33:43,075
Yes...
(gunshot blasts)

00:33:43,142 --> 00:33:45,444
LANGSTON: Come with me.
This way, sir.
STOKES: Shotgun!

00:33:45,511 --> 00:33:47,113
Clark! Clark!

00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:50,816
Situation! Clark!

00:34:23,621 --> 00:34:25,323
CONTROL (over radio):
Three-David-34, Control.

00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:26,491
Officer Clark, respond.

00:34:33,231 --> 00:34:35,200
Charlie-oh-three-Stokes,
Control. Respond.

00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:37,635
Control, Langston.

00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:39,237
Shots fired.
Two officers down.

00:34:39,304 --> 00:34:41,706
CHARLIE:
Got here too early, Ray,
but you're not gonna

00:34:41,773 --> 00:34:43,108
spoil my fun.

00:34:43,174 --> 00:34:44,709
Repeat. Shots fired.
Two officers down.

00:34:44,776 --> 00:34:47,645
Armed suspect with a shotgun
in the restaurant.

00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:49,013
CHARLIE:
Sure. Call 'em all.

00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,549
Nothing the old man likes better
than an audience.

00:34:51,616 --> 00:34:52,917
Isn't that so, Papa?!

00:34:52,984 --> 00:34:55,120
What-What-What... What
are you talking about?

00:34:55,186 --> 00:34:56,855
What?
Put your weapon down!

00:34:56,921 --> 00:34:59,424
I don't want
to have to shoot you!

00:34:59,491 --> 00:35:00,592
What do I care?

00:35:00,658 --> 00:35:01,760
I'm a cop killer

00:35:01,826 --> 00:35:03,695
twice over.
I just want

00:35:03,762 --> 00:35:05,196
to see my father die.

00:35:05,263 --> 00:35:07,732
You try and stop me,
and I'll blow you away!

00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:08,800
PAPA: What, are
you crazy?

00:35:08,867 --> 00:35:10,401
Are you out of
your mind?! (groans)

00:35:10,468 --> 00:35:12,837
Mr. DiMasa-- slow, controlled,
even breaths, please.

00:35:12,904 --> 00:35:14,472
HASKELL:
<i>Don't you ever get tired</i>

00:35:14,539 --> 00:35:16,007
of standing
on your feet all day?

00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:17,542
Man, I hear
that's what they do

00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:20,178
to those guys down in Gitmo
to make them talk.

00:35:20,245 --> 00:35:22,247
I can sit down,
if I want to.

00:35:22,313 --> 00:35:24,315
Why don't you, man?

00:35:26,651 --> 00:35:27,752
Maybe I don't want to.

00:35:27,819 --> 00:35:31,022
Thing is, I could
make you a hero, Barclay.

00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:33,391
I...

00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:34,692
guess I could make you famous.

00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:37,429
I've been screwing
with these other guys.

00:35:37,495 --> 00:35:39,197
You know that, right?

00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:43,001
But I could just give you
the whole head of cabbage.

00:35:43,067 --> 00:35:46,538
You must know
people at Ely, right?

00:35:47,572 --> 00:35:50,108
Maybe.

00:35:50,175 --> 00:35:53,411
Mr. DiMasa, you have something
implanted in your chest.

00:35:53,478 --> 00:35:54,813
You have to remain calm.

00:35:54,879 --> 00:35:55,980
(groaning)

00:35:56,047 --> 00:35:57,449
I hope it's tearing you up like

00:35:57,515 --> 00:35:59,284
a thousand
knives inside.

00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,485
I did that to you, Papa.

00:36:00,552 --> 00:36:01,653
(Papa groaning loudly)

00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:03,588
(yells, grunts)

00:36:03,655 --> 00:36:06,024
That's the sound I want to hear.

00:36:06,091 --> 00:36:09,160
Keep that strong DiMasa
heart pumping, Papa.

00:36:09,227 --> 00:36:12,163
It's a drumbeat
right to the grave.

00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,599
I wanted to be a doctor, Papa!

00:36:14,666 --> 00:36:16,334
What stopped you, Charlie?

00:36:16,401 --> 00:36:17,335
He did!

00:36:17,402 --> 00:36:18,636
Look what I built.

00:36:18,703 --> 00:36:21,106
For-For you, Charlie.

00:36:21,172 --> 00:36:22,540
I never wanted it!

00:36:22,607 --> 00:36:24,375
I could have been a great man.

00:36:24,442 --> 00:36:25,977
A doctor, Papa.

00:36:26,044 --> 00:36:27,712
But you had to wreck my life!

00:36:27,779 --> 00:36:29,147
LANGSTON:
Do what a doctor would do.

00:36:29,214 --> 00:36:30,482
Let him live.

00:36:30,548 --> 00:36:33,785
I'm not asking
for the world here, man. I...

00:36:33,852 --> 00:36:36,354
It's just,
my life there sucks.

00:36:36,421 --> 00:36:39,057
All I want is an extra
half hour in the yard,

00:36:39,124 --> 00:36:41,292
maybe some smokes
once in a while,

00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,863
but... nothing illegal, man.

00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:46,664
Screw you.

00:36:46,731 --> 00:36:49,534
I know I got to give up
Jekyll's name to somebody,

00:36:49,601 --> 00:36:50,835
while it's still
worth something.

00:36:50,902 --> 00:36:52,303
Might as well be you.

00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,005
Barclay, I like you a lot, man.

00:36:54,072 --> 00:36:56,141
You have a light finger
on that button.

00:36:56,207 --> 00:36:58,209
If it was me,
I'd be mashing

00:36:58,276 --> 00:37:00,378
that thing just
to watch me dance. I...

00:37:00,445 --> 00:37:02,847
But you are good people, man.

00:37:02,914 --> 00:37:06,317
But I guess I'd see you
on the 6:00 news, right?

00:37:06,384 --> 00:37:09,087
You'd be getting
a medal on your chest.

00:37:09,154 --> 00:37:10,422
I don't know.

00:37:10,488 --> 00:37:12,891
Would it help you
make detective, Barclay?

00:37:12,957 --> 00:37:15,660
You'd strut around
like those guys.

00:37:15,727 --> 00:37:17,762
You could probably
get laid, Barclay.

00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:20,098
I mean, you'd probably
get laid a lot.

00:37:20,165 --> 00:37:23,501
Who is he?

00:37:23,568 --> 00:37:25,937
Dr. Jekyll is your mother.

00:37:26,004 --> 00:37:27,338
What?

00:37:27,405 --> 00:37:29,174
And she banged every one of 'em

00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,775
before she killed them.
(croaks)

00:37:30,842 --> 00:37:32,577
(electrical crackling)

00:37:32,644 --> 00:37:34,446
(groaning in pain)

00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,981
(gasps)

00:37:41,186 --> 00:37:42,420
Sergeant Barclay.

00:37:42,487 --> 00:37:44,122
I need medical in
the holding cells.

00:37:44,189 --> 00:37:45,323
I got an inmate down.

00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,192
LANGSTON:
<i>Charlie, I understand</i>

00:37:47,258 --> 00:37:49,461
you wanting to kill
your old man, I do.

00:37:49,527 --> 00:37:51,029
But why Higgins?

00:37:51,096 --> 00:37:52,630
Why Herson?
Why all the others?

00:37:52,697 --> 00:37:55,600
You killed all those men,
Charlie? You did that?!

00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:58,536
Yeah... I killed
your friends, Pop.

00:37:58,603 --> 00:38:00,605
Your heroes.

00:38:00,672 --> 00:38:03,641
Great men who were
what I could never be.

00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:04,809
Never good enough.

00:38:04,876 --> 00:38:07,212
I got through three
years of medical school,

00:38:07,278 --> 00:38:08,746
and then Mama died.

00:38:08,813 --> 00:38:13,218
And you used that to suck me
back in, didn't you, Papa?

00:38:13,284 --> 00:38:14,619
I need, I needed
you, Charlie.

00:38:14,686 --> 00:38:16,588
CHARLIE:
To serve your heroes!

00:38:16,654 --> 00:38:19,124
I should have been your hero!

00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,358
I was lonely.

00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:23,261
I-I... I needed you, Charlie.

00:38:23,328 --> 00:38:25,330
Charlie, listen to me.

00:38:26,865 --> 00:38:28,967
I wished my old man dead
a thousand times over.

00:38:29,033 --> 00:38:31,536
He was a drunk, you
know? A real bad drunk.

00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:33,104
One night, he'd
been out fighting.

00:38:33,171 --> 00:38:35,940
A neighbor brought him home,
blind drunk.

00:38:36,007 --> 00:38:37,475
Someone had beaten him
so terribly,

00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:40,578
he had a bruise on his throat
the size of a baseball.

00:38:40,645 --> 00:38:41,813
I pulled him up
on the porch

00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,982
and watched him try
and catch his breath

00:38:44,048 --> 00:38:45,683
while he was
gargling blood.

00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,085
I was so tired

00:38:47,152 --> 00:38:48,987
of taking him
to the emergency room,

00:38:49,053 --> 00:38:51,356
I just left him there.

00:38:51,423 --> 00:38:53,992
Figured he'd
sleep it off.

00:38:54,058 --> 00:38:55,460
When I came down
in the morning,

00:38:55,527 --> 00:38:57,328
he was laying in a patch
of winter sunshine,

00:38:57,395 --> 00:38:59,531
and he was

00:38:59,597 --> 00:39:01,132
stone-cold dead
where I left him.

00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,567
How'd that make you feel?

00:39:04,402 --> 00:39:07,005
Not the way you think it's gonna
make you feel, Charlie.

00:39:07,071 --> 00:39:10,408
I just want to see him die.

00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:12,544
Shouldn't be much longer now.

00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,112
Let me tell you something,
Charlie.

00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:15,680
Even when the old man dies,

00:39:15,747 --> 00:39:18,283
you're not gonna stop
being his son.

00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:20,685
You become
the son of a ghost.

00:39:20,752 --> 00:39:22,187
The pain doesn't go away.

00:39:22,253 --> 00:39:23,721
The rage doesn't go away.

00:39:23,788 --> 00:39:28,226
So, come on, put your gun down,
walk out of here, be a man.

00:39:28,293 --> 00:39:30,228
I will.

00:39:30,295 --> 00:39:32,063
Soon as he's dead.

00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:33,698
I can't let
that happen, Charlie.

00:39:33,765 --> 00:39:35,266
I'm going
to stand up now.

00:39:37,469 --> 00:39:40,538
I'm standing up, Charlie.

00:39:43,775 --> 00:39:47,378
I'm going to walk into the back,
get some ice.

00:39:47,445 --> 00:39:49,747
Slow your father's
heart rate.

00:40:09,601 --> 00:40:10,535
(heavy sigh)

00:40:10,602 --> 00:40:11,870
(siren approaching)

00:40:15,507 --> 00:40:17,442
STOKES:
<i>Y'all better get out of here</i>

00:40:17,509 --> 00:40:20,779
before there's a crime
scene to investigate.

00:40:20,845 --> 00:40:22,747
You scared
the hell out of us, Nicky.

00:40:22,814 --> 00:40:24,816
Ah... I'll be all right.

00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:26,484
LANGSTON:
Papa DiMasa made it
through surgery.

00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:30,355
The doctors were able to remove
the filter and stent the vein.

00:40:30,422 --> 00:40:31,723
He's going to make it.

00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:34,659
The Jekyll case is closed.

00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:36,428
On to the next one, right?

00:40:36,494 --> 00:40:39,164
Unfortunately,
there's always a next one.

00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,365
Mm.

00:40:40,432 --> 00:40:41,566
I'll see you soon.

00:40:41,633 --> 00:40:43,968
All right.

00:40:44,035 --> 00:40:45,970
I'll be back
to give you a lift home?

00:40:46,037 --> 00:40:48,239
(groaning):
Oh, no way.

00:40:48,306 --> 00:40:50,241
You're a terrible driver.

00:40:50,308 --> 00:40:52,777
(Sidle and Stokes laugh)

00:40:52,844 --> 00:40:53,978
STOKES:
Ray?

00:40:54,045 --> 00:40:56,047
Yeah?

00:40:57,382 --> 00:40:59,317
That story you told
about your father--

00:40:59,384 --> 00:41:03,088
did you really just
let him die like that?

00:41:03,154 --> 00:41:06,624
I should have let the son
of a bitch die, but...

00:41:06,691 --> 00:41:09,761
I loved him.

00:41:09,828 --> 00:41:12,130
I took a knife,
I opened his trachea,

00:41:12,197 --> 00:41:14,999
saved his life.

00:41:15,066 --> 00:41:17,502
Watched him die of
lung cancer two years later.

00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:24,175
Hey, you feel better.

00:41:24,242 --> 00:41:26,211
I play dead good, don't I?

00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:28,746
You should've been an actor.

00:41:28,813 --> 00:41:30,148
(laughs)

00:41:30,215 --> 00:41:32,350
Thanks, Cath.

00:41:32,417 --> 00:41:34,452
Nick's going to be okay.

00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:35,787
(sighs)

00:41:35,854 --> 00:41:36,988
That's great.

00:41:37,055 --> 00:41:39,357
HODGES:
<i>Okay. Thanks.</i>

00:41:39,424 --> 00:41:40,992
How is he?

00:41:41,059 --> 00:41:42,894
I'm assuming he's okay,
because he wants us

00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:45,663
to bring him a pizza,
or he's gonna kick our asses.

00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:46,831
(quiet laugh)

00:41:46,898 --> 00:41:48,666
Do you want to
come with us?

00:41:48,733 --> 00:41:50,935
No, thanks.

00:41:51,002 --> 00:41:55,106
Uh... just tell him
I'm glad he's all right.

00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:00,678
Jim.

00:42:00,745 --> 00:42:02,847
Come on, I'll buy you
a drink at PJ's.

00:42:02,914 --> 00:42:04,382
Listen, uh, give me a minute.

00:42:04,449 --> 00:42:06,451
I'll catch up to you.

00:42:11,456 --> 00:42:14,726
Officer, give us
a little room, will you?

00:42:14,793 --> 00:42:16,394
Hello, Nate.

00:42:19,097 --> 00:42:20,698
I came to tell
you that...

00:42:20,765 --> 00:42:23,034
You killed Jekyll.

00:42:23,101 --> 00:42:27,338
All the urgency's gone out
of your eyes, Doctor.

00:42:27,405 --> 00:42:30,508
All the tension's out
of your body.

00:42:30,575 --> 00:42:33,611
You look like you came out
of it relatively unscathed.

00:42:33,678 --> 00:42:35,780
You know what they say,
"Whatever doesn't kill you..."

00:42:35,847 --> 00:42:38,616
I knew you
and Charlie would get along.

00:42:38,683 --> 00:42:41,553
Daddy issues.

00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:44,589
And the irony is, Doctor,

00:42:44,656 --> 00:42:46,091
he didn't kill nearly
as many people

00:42:46,157 --> 00:42:47,992
as he would've,
if he'd followed his dream

00:42:48,059 --> 00:42:50,762
and become, you know,
your average surgeon.

00:42:50,829 --> 00:42:52,063
Am I right?

00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:54,032
Good-bye, Nate.
