00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:12,867
I am not ready for this.

00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:14,302
Yeah, you are.

00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:16,304
Besides, you got to be.

00:00:16,371 --> 00:00:18,640
Dr. Ray's still on leave
from the concussion.

00:00:18,707 --> 00:00:19,841
We're all tapped out.

00:00:19,908 --> 00:00:22,510
I got a multiple
in Northtown.

00:00:22,577 --> 00:00:24,746
Call me if you need
anything, okay?

00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:36,858
(indistinct chatter)

00:00:38,526 --> 00:00:40,528

Damn it, Derrick, you're
screwing up my one-to-ones.

00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,711
DERRICK:
Sorry.

00:01:29,778 --> 00:01:32,881
This stuff is giving me
the desire for pancakes.

00:01:32,947 --> 00:01:35,250
WOMAN: Yeah, me, too.
(laughter)

00:01:35,317 --> 00:01:37,352
(groans)
Kids.

00:01:37,419 --> 00:01:38,653
Okay,

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,123
crime cadets, this is
serious crime-fighting business,

00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,326
so... back to
being dead,

00:01:44,392 --> 00:01:46,928
please.

00:01:46,995 --> 00:01:49,331
Excuse me, CSI Hodges?

00:01:49,397 --> 00:01:50,899
Yes.

00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:52,500
CSI Hodges,

00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:54,636
th-that's me.
Katy Cypress.
Nice to meet you.

00:01:54,703 --> 00:01:56,104
Look, I know

00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:58,540
that this is just a program
for wannabe CSIs.

00:01:58,606 --> 00:02:00,442
And this exercise does test

00:02:00,508 --> 00:02:02,110
observational and
evidence-collection skills.

00:02:02,177 --> 00:02:03,945
Yes.
Is it at least based

00:02:04,012 --> 00:02:05,080
on a real case?

00:02:05,146 --> 00:02:07,282
No.

00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:08,917
This is just
brute-force rote work.

00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:11,019
I couldn't agree with you more.
The real fun

00:02:11,086 --> 00:02:12,687
is nailing bad guys.

00:02:12,754 --> 00:02:14,756
And that's about
interpreting the evidence

00:02:14,823 --> 00:02:16,291
and solving
a real mystery.

00:02:16,358 --> 00:02:17,926
That's what... you do,

00:02:17,993 --> 00:02:19,794
and that's what I want to do.

00:02:22,063 --> 00:02:23,665
Okay.

00:02:23,732 --> 00:02:24,933
I'll tell you what.

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,969
Let's finish up here,
and then you

00:02:28,036 --> 00:02:29,838
grab a couple
of your cadet buddies

00:02:29,904 --> 00:02:31,673
and meet me at the Crime Lab

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,807
for a <i>real</i> challenge--

00:02:32,874 --> 00:02:34,009
<i>if</i> you're
up to it.

00:02:34,075 --> 00:02:35,477
Oh, I am up to it.

00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:36,645
Guillermo.

00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:38,880
He'd love to do it.

00:02:38,947 --> 00:02:40,215
(laughs):
He has no life.

00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:43,351
I collect spores,
molds and fungi.

00:02:43,418 --> 00:02:45,954
You, too, Derrick--
it'll be fun.

00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:47,555
(beeping)

00:02:50,558 --> 00:02:52,560
Grab a seat.

00:02:53,728 --> 00:02:56,665
(laughs)

00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:58,667
Are we waiting on Derrick?

00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:00,135
Uh, no. He's not coming.

00:03:00,201 --> 00:03:01,369
He has video-game

00:03:01,436 --> 00:03:02,370
issues.

00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:03,838
Ah.
These files

00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:07,509
are from a case we investigated
four months ago.

00:03:07,575 --> 00:03:10,145
You said you wanted
to match wits with real CSIs.

00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:11,313
Now's your chance.

00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:13,648
Among the many
consequences

00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:15,317
of a construction boom
are structures

00:03:15,383 --> 00:03:17,686
that are thrown together
with little regard

00:03:17,752 --> 00:03:18,820
for building codes.

00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:20,655
The fire department
responded quickly.

00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:22,757
<i>But even so,</i>
<i>the lower three levels</i>

00:03:22,824 --> 00:03:26,928
<i>of this apartment building were</i>
<i>almost completely consumed.</i>

00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:29,364
<i>The firemen, or,</i>
<i>as we like to call them,</i>

00:03:29,431 --> 00:03:31,900
<i>the "Evidence</i>
<i>Eradication Crew,"</i>

00:03:31,967 --> 00:03:33,835
<i>got the blaze under control.</i>

00:03:33,902 --> 00:03:35,337
<i>But they were</i>
<i>utterly unprepared</i>

00:03:35,403 --> 00:03:38,940
<i>for the astonishing sight</i>
<i>waiting there to greet them.</i>

00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:40,842
Oh, boy, do I
remember that one.

00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:43,078
It was an
incredible case.

00:03:43,144 --> 00:03:45,347
I mean, like, you would never
even believe it was possible

00:03:45,413 --> 00:03:46,614
unless you saw
the evidence yourself.

00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:49,551
Yeah, which is why
I was about to show it to them.

00:03:49,617 --> 00:03:51,319
Oh.

00:03:51,386 --> 00:03:52,921
Hey. I'm Wendy.

00:03:52,988 --> 00:03:54,289
And you are...?

00:03:54,356 --> 00:03:55,624
Crime cadets.

00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,791
Guillermo.

00:03:56,858 --> 00:03:58,860
KATY:
Could we see the
body already,

00:03:58,927 --> 00:04:00,128
please?

00:04:00,195 --> 00:04:01,463
Yeah. Okay.

00:04:01,529 --> 00:04:02,631
Hey.

00:04:02,697 --> 00:04:04,766
I tell it better
than you.

00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,434
Trust me, you guys

00:04:06,501 --> 00:04:08,236
are really gonna
enjoy this.

00:04:08,303 --> 00:04:10,138
<i>What used to be</i>
<i>the parking garage</i>

00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:12,874
<i>was filled with the contents</i>
<i>of a dozen apartments,</i>

00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:14,209
<i>everything charred</i>

00:04:14,275 --> 00:04:16,378
<i>virtually beyond recognition...</i>

00:04:16,444 --> 00:04:20,248
<i>with one incredible exception.</i>

00:04:20,315 --> 00:04:22,751
<i>The CSIs had never seen</i>
<i>anything like it.</i>

00:04:22,817 --> 00:04:24,686
I've never seen
anything like it.

00:04:24,753 --> 00:04:27,222
There's barely a mark on her.

00:04:27,288 --> 00:04:31,326
Given the amount of available
fuel consumed by this fire,

00:04:31,393 --> 00:04:32,994
I'd say we
should be looking

00:04:33,061 --> 00:04:35,563
at a pile of roasted
flesh and bone.

00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,667
The body must have been put here
after the fire was extinguished.

00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:40,035
There were a dozen cops

00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:41,903
and two dozen
firefighters
on the scene.

00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,673
The likelihood of anyone
carrying a body into <i>this</i>

00:04:44,739 --> 00:04:48,243
and getting out unseen
is... slim to none.

00:04:49,411 --> 00:04:51,413
HODGES:
<i>That's when I said...</i>

00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,849
It's as if...
the fire refused to touch her.

00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:55,817
Excuse me?

00:04:55,884 --> 00:04:57,218
And then Wendy said...

00:04:59,287 --> 00:05:01,256
HODGES:
<i>The question is,</i>

00:05:01,323 --> 00:05:04,492
<i>is it miracle or murder?</i>

00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,833
Uh, please familiarize yourself
with this evidence report.

00:05:14,536 --> 00:05:17,505
(quietly): That's what you're
doing, you're lying to children?

00:05:17,572 --> 00:05:18,773
It's a teaching exercise.

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,642
It's an exercise in self-love.

00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:22,477
Just play along
and be a role model, please?

00:05:22,544 --> 00:05:25,180
Uh, no. Why would
I play along with you?

00:05:25,246 --> 00:05:27,349
Because if you
can't even imagine yourself

00:05:27,415 --> 00:05:30,719
out in the field, how
will you ever expect Ecklie to?

00:05:32,754 --> 00:05:35,256
(loudly):
Okay, so there we were.

00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,294
The question is,
is it miracle...

00:05:39,361 --> 00:05:40,895
or murder?

00:05:40,962 --> 00:05:45,400
Either way, she tried as best
as she could to survive.

00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:47,669
(laughs)

00:05:49,971 --> 00:05:52,841

You been working out
or something?

00:06:29,915 --> 00:06:31,316
Yeah, new diet.

00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:33,704
No more donuts or sugary snacks,
just-just pure protein.

00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:34,972
All beef, all day.

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,641
Trading the diabetes
for a heart attack.

00:06:36,707 --> 00:06:38,342
(phone rings)
Good call.

00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:39,477
Yeah, what's up, Cath?

00:06:39,544 --> 00:06:41,379
I'm in Mega-Lo-Mattress hell.

00:06:41,446 --> 00:06:44,015
Found another DB in a quilt.
I'll be here a while.

00:06:44,082 --> 00:06:45,450
Oh, that's okay-- I just
wrapped up

00:06:45,516 --> 00:06:47,485
my 419, I'll hold down the f...
(man clears throat)

00:06:47,552 --> 00:06:49,187
(retching)

00:06:49,253 --> 00:06:50,822
(laughter)

00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:52,023
Nicky?

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,191
(laughs)

00:06:53,257 --> 00:06:54,659
WOMAN:
Oh, my God!

00:06:54,726 --> 00:06:56,227
(loud retching)

00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,652
Nicky? You there?

00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,821
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,490
(retching)

00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,366
Yeah, it looks like
I'm gonna be tied up

00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,934
for a little while longer
here, Catherine.

00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,969
BARCLAY: Need paramedics and
HazMat down to the squad.

00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:19,940
GUILLERMO:
Okay, I see it.

00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:23,210
The concrete around the furnace
is pitted and chipped,

00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,278
most likely from
rapid thermal expansion.

00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:26,346
It's called "spalling."

00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:27,447
Now, take a look

00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,116
at the vent pipes.

00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,183
What do they
tell you?

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,284
They're rusty.

00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:32,652
And since fire is essentially

00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,287
a rapid oxidation reaction...

00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:35,389
It means that
the furnace

00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,823
is most likely
where the fire started.

00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,724
Very good.

00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,959
This has got to be arson.

00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:40,427
What makes you say that?

00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:41,962
Most fires are
either started

00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:44,331
because of insurance fraud or
to cover up evidence of a crime.

00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:46,299
GUILLERMO:
And that certainly is a crime.

00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,300
Were all
the tenants

00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:48,535
accounted for?

00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,537
And were any able to
identify the victim?

00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,039
Good questions...

00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,740
for a detective.

00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,681
So, all the tenants
have been accounted for.

00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,983
I showed her picture
around, but, uh,

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,284
no one recognized her.

00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,754
Or so they say.

00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,222
Thanks, Captain.
We'll, uh,
let you know

00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,591
what we come up with.
(chuckles)

00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,694
That's great.

00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,595
You know what?
Nobody gives a damn

00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,431
about life or death.

00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,333
That's the truth.
So why should I?

00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,734
Why should you?

00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:23,770
(slurring):
Do you know what the
best thing to do is?

00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,507
Is to just to go home...

00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:30,544
and cuddle up
with someone you love...

00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,946
and just...

00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,614
forget...

00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:39,553
...just forget about
all this-this...

00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,054
madness.

00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,890
(Hodges exhales)

00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:46,760
But that would let them all
off the hook, wouldn't it?

00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:48,895
So, you know what
I'm gonna do?

00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:52,265
I'm gonna go home,
I'm gonna get painted up,

00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,700
put on some Kevlar,

00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,268
go on a five-state
shooting spree

00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:58,205
and take out these scumbags
one at a time. Screw 'em.

00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,307
And then let

00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:04,378
copper-jacketed
justice take its

00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,446
sweet release.

00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,052
Ooh, ouch.

00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,220
(chuckles) What?

00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,055
(laughing)

00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:17,457
What?!

00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:18,925
What the heck? No.

00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,595
(laughs): No, I'm not going
to do that, all right?

00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,430
(sputters)

00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:24,698
No, I choose life.

00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,769
Keep me apprised.

00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:32,005
HODGES:
<i>FYI, the alcoholism rate</i>
<i>among police officers</i>

00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,607
<i>is double the national average.</i>

00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:34,975
Suicide rate's triple.

00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:37,277
Really?
KATY:
Hey, uh, wait a second.

00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,279
That tub-- where's it from?

00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,982
It's, uh, from apartment 2B,
second floor.

00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:43,650
SIMMS:
Whose tenant just happened

00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:45,819
to be out of town
right before the fire.

00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:47,587
Does he have a record?

00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,956
No, but he wasn't exactly
a model citizen, either.

00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:52,259
He'd had run-ins
with the landlord before

00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,594
over illegal sublets.
Okay.

00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,496
Check this out...

00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,932
<i>off-the-books sublet girl</i>
<i>was in the tub</i>

00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,167
<i>when the fire breaks out.</i>

00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,935
<i>She dies of carbon monoxide</i>
<i>poisoning,</i>

00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:03,603
<i>leaving no marks on the body.</i>

00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,839
<i>She was still in the tub</i>

00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:07,774
<i>when the flames</i>
<i>torched the floor</i>

00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,309
<i>and it all came tumbling down.</i>

00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:12,746
So, the bath oil
on her skin acts
like a shield

00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:14,614
long enough to protect her
from the flames until

00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:17,284
she is discovered.
That's not a bad theory.

00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:18,785
And for a while,
it was our theory.

00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,187
It was also
the wrong theory.

00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:21,822
HODGES:
Most essential oils

00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,824
in bath gels
have a flash point

00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,360
of under 250 degrees.
With a fire that hot,

00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,695
it would've actually
drawn the flames to her,

00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:31,264
not protect her.
All right.

00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,100
Well, since
we know it's arson,

00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,601
if we identify
the victim,

00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:37,270
it could lead us
to the arsonist.
Yeah.

00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,139
What'd you get
from Autopsy?

00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:40,807
For that, you'll need a coroner.

00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:43,143
And, uh, luckily,
I happen to know where we

00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,378
can find one.

00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,113
Take five.

00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,549
ANDREWS:
Hey, Hodges.
Oh, hey, Henry.

00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:53,420
Yes?
Remember that time

00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,722
you said that thing
about your having
a higher commitment

00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,357
to the lab
and the pursuit of justice?

00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:59,459
Yeah, I've probably
said that more than once.
Yeah, you have.

00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:00,994
For the record,
I find it admirable

00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,662
and Wendy does, too.

00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,865
She does?
Yeah.

00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,067
We were chatting about it last
weekend at the blood bank.

00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:08,068
We donate together.

00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:09,269
Oh.

00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:10,437
No, B-positive.

00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,205
Actually, Wendy
and I have

00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:13,206
a lot in common.

00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,841
We dabble in
calligraphy,

00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:15,976
we're both
passionate

00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:18,078
about French neoclassical
architecture,

00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:21,048
and we are both
allergic to eggplant.

00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:25,686
Look, I was just thinking
that I should ask her out

00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:28,789
on a date, and I assume that
you'd be cool with that,

00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,624
due to your admirable
commitment to the lab.

00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,092
So are you

00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,361
cool with that?

00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,699
Totally.
Great.

00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:41,034
Great, yes, see?
That is awesome.

00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,536
Thank you, you're
a man of principle.

00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:44,571
(chuckles)

00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:47,541
Uh, Wendy.

00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:49,376
SIMMS: Hey.
ANDREWS: Hello.

00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:51,111
What's up?
Good.
How are you? Hi.

00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:53,747
Um, I was wondering if you want
to go out to eat tonight

00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:54,748
after work.

00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,249
Yeah.
Yeah?
Okay.

00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,452
All right, yeah,
I'm just gonna...
(Simms chuckling)

00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:04,291
MAN (over P.A.):
Attention, all personnel...

00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:07,928
quarantine is still in effect
until further notice.

00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:10,997
Continue to observe all
class-four protocol.

00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,266
(devices beeping)

00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,570
No anthrax, no ricin,
no botulinum.

00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:19,706
And no plague and no tularemia.

00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:20,907
We're good, people.

00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:22,642
Area's clear.

00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,280
(sighs)

00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:30,417
Well, if it's not in the air
or a contact toxin,

00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:32,986
it has to be something
they ate or drank.

00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,155
Wouldn't be the first
time a bunch of cops

00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,790
cheaped out on a dinner
and ended up

00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,358
spewing out
of both ends.

00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,760
You're a CSI.

00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:41,661
It's not your problem.

00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:45,065
I think I'm making it
mine tonight.

00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,467
SANDERS:
<i>Have you</i>

00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,469
encountered
any cases recently

00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:51,805
with similar symptoms?

00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:54,641
Projectile vomit,
sweats, diarrhea?

00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,309
I mean, it could be
almost anything thing.

00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:57,611
You know, there's

00:12:57,678 --> 00:12:59,379
a lot of stuff
going around.

00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,682
This town is a petri dish.

00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,485
(grunting)

00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:08,388
Hey, Jenkins...

00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,223
how you doing?
(moans)

00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,692
I will get out of here

00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,927
in a second to let you
get back to sleep.

00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:17,130
But I need you to tell me
everything you had to eat

00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,331
or drink today.

00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,534
(muttering)

00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,205
(retching)

00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:29,042
Uh, nurse?

00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,312
Hey, kids, you know,
a lot of people

00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,381
believe that all a coroner
does is determine

00:13:34,448 --> 00:13:36,550
cause, manner,
and time of death.

00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:37,984
And in a case like this,

00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,853
there is so much more
to discover.

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,823
<i>All you have to do is look.</i>

00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,725
<i>Her prints weren't</i>
<i>in the system.</i>

00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,059
<i>And no bodies matching</i>
<i>her description</i>

00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:47,260
<i>were in missing persons.</i>

00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,129
<i>The condition of her...</i>

00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:54,534
...area is consistent
with recent sexual activity.

00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,303
But her wet mount
came back negative

00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,405
for, uh...

00:13:58,472 --> 00:14:00,374
Semen?
Thank you.

00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,742
I believe this woman had

00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:03,677
safe sex before she died.
GUILLERMO:
Could we get

00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:04,778
to the C.O.D. please?

00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,014
Not so fast.

00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,248
You'll miss it.

00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:10,283
The victim had

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,752
very poor dental hygiene:

00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:13,420
<i>plaque with numerous cavities,</i>

00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:16,089
<i>crowns made of white gold--</i>

00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:18,859
<i>a substance not commonly used</i>
<i>in the United States.</i>

00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,328
All of which led me to conclude
that the victim was Russian...

00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:22,562
GUILLERMO:
Russian or Eastern European.

00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,865
Obviously.

00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:26,600
This is, uh,
"Vokovushka,"

00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,602
the Russian Mighty Mouse.

00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:30,804
Perhaps she was
a tourist?

00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,107
What are these

00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:35,475
glossy patches on her skin?

00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:36,643
I-I don't know.

00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,078
I sent samples to Trace.

00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:39,479
Talk to Trace.

00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,281
Actually, Trace loves to talk.

00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:42,716
I'd suggest carving out

00:14:42,783 --> 00:14:44,885
a couple hours
and taking snacks.
C.O.D.?

00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,953
Right.

00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,256
There's no soot
in the trachea.

00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:52,693
(cat meowing, man laughs nearby)

00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,927
Lung tissue color

00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:54,995
is normal.

00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:56,763
(laughing)

00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:01,068
(laughter, meowing continue)

00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,903
There's no sign
of carbon monoxide

00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:04,371
pink at all.
(meowing)

00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,274
Meow.

00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:08,275
(phone ringing)

00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:10,911
(sighs)

00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:13,313
Hello, Morgue.

00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,350
Of course.
I'm always ready.

00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,984
Right.

00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:21,688
All right, the CSIs are
on their way down.

00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,024
She didn't inhale smoke.

00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:26,626
Give me your notes.
Give me your notes.

00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:28,628
Get out!

00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:29,963
(clears throat)

00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,832
PHILLIPS:
You see, tox
revealed a BAC

00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:34,801
of .30 with several
benzodiazepine sedatives,

00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:36,970
along with zolpidem
in her system.

00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:38,839
Now, while the individual levels
were sublethal...

00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,173
The combination was...

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,843
Deadly. That's right.

00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,611
C.O.D. was multiple drug
overdose.

00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:46,713
The victim was dead
before the fire.

00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:49,916
I was about
to say that.

00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,752
Too bad I said it first.

00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:00,160
STOKES:
Here you go.

00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:02,929
Now, we're starting off small.

00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:04,598
This is only the
stuff from the desks

00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:06,933
of the officers who
actually got sick.

00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,669
This is starting small?

00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,103
Yep.

00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,439
And you better get the
GCMS fired up, boss.

00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:14,274
Greg's bringing in vomit,
blood and fecals.

00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:15,475
(slapping)

00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:18,311
(tapping rhythmically)

00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:20,113
Get it going.

00:16:22,883 --> 00:16:24,751
SIMMS:
<i>In an arson investigation,</i>

00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,253

00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,221

00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,363
Hey, Wendy.

00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,432
Come take a look at this.

00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,770
It's a natural gas line.

00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,238
It's uncapped.

00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:49,643
There's no tarnish
on these tool marks.

00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,011
This was done recently.

00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:52,412
Yeah.

00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,450
Did you find the gas cap
at the scene?

00:16:58,151 --> 00:16:59,653
Hodges.
Hmm?

00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,388
Uh, no.

00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:03,423
And we sifted
through a ton of char.

00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,791
KATY:
I'm sure you're still

00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,294
finding soot in places
you don't want to talk about.

00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:13,667
Well, no gas cap
means no accident.

00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:16,103
That proves that, uh,
we're right about arson.

00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,971
So it would seem.

00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:20,907
(grinding)

00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:22,909
SIMMS:
<i>We removed</i>
<i>a section of the pipe</i>

00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:25,445
to preserve the tool marks.

00:17:27,748 --> 00:17:29,616
But what we didn't know

00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:31,618
was that
this crime scene--

00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:34,187
it very well
could have been our last.

00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:35,956
(grinding)

00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:38,692
(clattering)

00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,560
No!

00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:51,772
(sighs)

00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:54,107
SIMMS:
Shortly thereafter, the city
declared the building

00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,376
structurally unsound, and...

00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:58,745
that was the last time
CSI was allowed in.

00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:01,915
He saved my life.

00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:05,085
He saved the evidence, too.

00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:13,040
SANDERS (sighs):
<i>You got to be kidding me.</i>

00:18:13,107 --> 00:18:15,643
What do you mean,
the GCMS run isn't done yet?

00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:16,844
It was supposed to be done
an hour ago.

00:18:16,911 --> 00:18:17,978
I don't know what's going on.

00:18:18,045 --> 00:18:19,513
Well, I have a bunch
of sick cops

00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,915
who need answers,
and if you have

00:18:20,981 --> 00:18:22,550
to pull another shift
to get it done,

00:18:22,616 --> 00:18:23,651
you're going
to have to.

00:18:23,717 --> 00:18:25,853
Let me look at this.
(sighs)

00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,688
Henry,

00:18:27,755 --> 00:18:29,557
the run cycle's been altered.

00:18:29,623 --> 00:18:31,091
You set it to
perform a cleaning

00:18:31,158 --> 00:18:32,760
and test cycle
after each sample.

00:18:32,826 --> 00:18:35,162
No, I didn't set it like that.
I swear.

00:18:35,229 --> 00:18:37,364
Well, maybe a power interruption
could have reset it

00:18:37,431 --> 00:18:38,432
to a default.

00:18:38,499 --> 00:18:40,000
There you go.

00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:41,135
Problem solved.

00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:42,570
You lucked out.

00:18:42,636 --> 00:18:44,471
Yeah.

00:18:44,538 --> 00:18:47,208
♪ ♪

00:18:54,048 --> 00:18:55,549
The uncapped gas line

00:18:55,616 --> 00:18:56,550
was the fuel.

00:18:56,617 --> 00:18:59,420
What else do you
need to make a fire?

00:18:59,486 --> 00:19:00,454
A spark.

00:19:00,521 --> 00:19:01,789
That's right.

00:19:01,856 --> 00:19:05,059
And I've got a whole box
full of sparks right over here.

00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,127
Take a look.

00:19:13,934 --> 00:19:15,769
According
to this maintenance record,

00:19:15,836 --> 00:19:18,205
this breaker box was serviced
the same day as the fire.

00:19:18,272 --> 00:19:19,807
GUILLERMO: And it looks
like the same company

00:19:19,874 --> 00:19:21,442
maintains the gas lines.
HODGES:
They do.

00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:23,844
The police questioned
the maintenance man,

00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:27,047
but the CSIs found this
in his van.

00:19:29,316 --> 00:19:30,951
KATY:
The pipe cap?

00:19:31,018 --> 00:19:33,854
The arsonist kept evidence
of the crime on him?

00:19:33,921 --> 00:19:35,723
Serial killers often
keep souvenirs.

00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:37,791
The maintenance man
told the cops that he had gone

00:19:37,858 --> 00:19:39,727
to the apartment building
to service the gas line

00:19:39,793 --> 00:19:41,562
and removed the cap,
which had become corroded.

00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:43,097
But when he returned
to his van

00:19:43,163 --> 00:19:46,066
to find a replacement,
he found he didn't have one,

00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:47,635
so he left.

00:19:47,701 --> 00:19:49,303
He left the gas line uncapped?

00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,738
He said he forgot.

00:19:50,804 --> 00:19:52,806
He thought he closed
the gas line completely, but he

00:19:52,873 --> 00:19:55,142
must have left a slow leak,
which he didn't notice

00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:56,777
because he was losing
his sense of smell--

00:19:56,844 --> 00:19:58,078
or so he claimed.

00:19:58,145 --> 00:19:59,246
His medical records
confirmed that.

00:19:59,313 --> 00:20:00,748
GUILLERMO:
So, natural gas

00:20:00,814 --> 00:20:02,316
gradually filled the room...

00:20:02,383 --> 00:20:03,717
KATY:
<i>Until there was enough,</i>

00:20:03,784 --> 00:20:05,920
<i>so that when the furnace</i>
<i>clicked on...</i>

00:20:05,986 --> 00:20:07,054
(clicking)

00:20:07,121 --> 00:20:08,489
Whoosh.

00:20:08,556 --> 00:20:09,924
Indeed.

00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,492
It was an accident.

00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:13,160
Which means that it wasn't set

00:20:13,227 --> 00:20:14,495
to destroy the victim's body.

00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:15,829
Our theory was completely wrong.

00:20:15,896 --> 00:20:17,298

Hey.
Hi.

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,135
Uh, I got great news.

00:20:21,202 --> 00:20:23,237
I had to call in a couple
of favors, but I got us

00:20:23,304 --> 00:20:26,140
a reservation
at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.

00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:27,875
It's, like,
the best view in Vegas.

00:20:27,942 --> 00:20:29,243
Wow.

00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,178
ANDREWS:
That's cool, right?
SIMMS: It-it's, uh...

00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:33,180
a little more
fancy-pants

00:20:33,247 --> 00:20:35,649
than the cop diner
that I'd been picturing.

00:20:35,716 --> 00:20:37,151
(chuckling):
No. I, um... I was going

00:20:37,218 --> 00:20:39,186
to surprise you,
but then I thought, you know,

00:20:39,253 --> 00:20:40,421
the gentlemanly thing to do

00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:42,489
would be to let you know,
so you could dress

00:20:42,556 --> 00:20:44,091
appropriately
for the occasion.

00:20:44,158 --> 00:20:46,493
I'm going to go home on
my lunch break and get my suit.

00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,729
You're wearing a suit?

00:20:49,763 --> 00:20:52,967
<i>Ce sera parfaît.</i>

00:20:53,033 --> 00:20:57,104
It means, "It will be perfect."

00:20:57,171 --> 00:20:59,039
SIMMS:
Um...

00:21:00,074 --> 00:21:01,809
(chuckling)

00:21:01,876 --> 00:21:04,144
STOKES:
<i>According to Henry,</i>
<i>there were no drugs,</i>

00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:05,713
poisons or toxins in any

00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:07,448
of the food or drink samples
I collected.

00:21:07,515 --> 00:21:08,782
We'll just have to test

00:21:08,849 --> 00:21:09,917
every consumable in the station.

00:21:09,984 --> 00:21:11,685
It's shigella.

00:21:11,752 --> 00:21:13,621
Positive?
I called in a favor

00:21:13,687 --> 00:21:15,389
at the hospital's microbio lab.

00:21:15,456 --> 00:21:18,125
We just did cultures
on each of the sick unis.

00:21:18,192 --> 00:21:19,760
They all have it.

00:21:19,827 --> 00:21:22,830
Okay, well,
shigella is food-borne.

00:21:22,897 --> 00:21:25,299
It typically vectors through
unsanitary handling practices.

00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:28,235
Yeah, but something
doesn't make sense.

00:21:28,302 --> 00:21:31,205
According to what the unis
told me between pukes...
(man clears throat)

00:21:31,272 --> 00:21:33,541
...none of them ate any
of the same things today,

00:21:33,607 --> 00:21:35,809
so how did they all come down

00:21:35,876 --> 00:21:38,913
with the same
bacterial infection?

00:21:38,979 --> 00:21:41,348
STOKES:
I might be able to answer that.
I'll call you back.

00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:53,594
Hey, Nick. What's up?

00:21:53,661 --> 00:21:54,895
Hold out your hands, Metcalf.

00:21:56,263 --> 00:21:57,998
And, uh, don't touch me,

00:21:58,065 --> 00:21:59,967
please.

00:22:05,673 --> 00:22:08,108
So, basically, we have
an accidental fire

00:22:08,175 --> 00:22:10,277
and a victim whose body

00:22:10,344 --> 00:22:12,413
managed to remain
unburned in it.

00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:15,182
GUILLERMO:
These patches on her skin,

00:22:15,249 --> 00:22:17,117
did you guys get
anything useful from Trace?

00:22:17,184 --> 00:22:19,153
You always get
something from Trace.

00:22:37,605 --> 00:22:39,273
CSI Hodges.
Trace Tech Langston.

00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,941
What do you have for me?

00:22:41,008 --> 00:22:43,744
The question, CSI Hodges,
is what don't I have for you?

00:22:43,811 --> 00:22:46,947
I used, uh, polarized light
microscopy to identify

00:22:47,014 --> 00:22:49,283
the glossy patches
on your victim's skin.

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,419
And not to sound corny, but I
think you'll find the results

00:22:52,486 --> 00:22:54,288
a-maize-ing.

00:22:56,991 --> 00:22:58,959
Starch molecules.

00:22:59,026 --> 00:23:00,594
Vaporized cornstarch,
to be precise.

00:23:00,661 --> 00:23:03,564
Did you know the word
"cornstarch" is derived

00:23:03,631 --> 00:23:04,999
from the Middle English
"sterchen"

00:23:05,065 --> 00:23:07,434
meaning "to stiffen,"
which is apropos

00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:08,669
to the condition of your vic.

00:23:08,736 --> 00:23:11,505
(laughs) Langston, the way
that your rapier wit

00:23:11,572 --> 00:23:13,908
envelopes critical information,
is just so...

00:23:13,974 --> 00:23:15,075
Thrilling?

00:23:15,142 --> 00:23:17,411
That's exactly
what I was going to say.

00:23:17,478 --> 00:23:19,413
Now, you say you derived
these results

00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,748
from a simple
polarized light test?

00:23:20,814 --> 00:23:22,483
Lesser men would have

00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,851
resorted to using the GCMS.

00:23:23,918 --> 00:23:26,086
Why use a sledgehammer
to kill a fly?

00:23:26,153 --> 00:23:27,922
I bow to the master.
Nonsense.

00:23:27,988 --> 00:23:29,156
"You are great.
I am great."

00:23:29,223 --> 00:23:32,159
M-5.
The Ultimate Computer.

00:23:32,226 --> 00:23:33,427
<i>Star Trek,</i> the original series.

00:23:33,494 --> 00:23:35,262
Is there any other?

00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:37,164
It's like you're inside my head.

00:23:37,231 --> 00:23:40,601
(both laughing)

00:23:40,668 --> 00:23:42,970
That Trace tech
sounds kinda...

00:23:43,037 --> 00:23:44,471
Obsequious.

00:23:45,673 --> 00:23:46,807
Misunderstood.

00:23:47,775 --> 00:23:50,477
You look concerned.

00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,015
I am.

00:23:56,917 --> 00:23:58,586
How does somebody get coated
in vaporized cornstarch?

00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,188
Body powder?

00:24:01,255 --> 00:24:03,157
SIMMS:
It's a health-conscious
alternative to talc.

00:24:03,224 --> 00:24:07,161
I doubt that powder would be
thick enough to account for...

00:24:08,596 --> 00:24:10,497
Peanuts.

00:24:10,564 --> 00:24:11,866
Cornstarch peanuts.

00:24:11,932 --> 00:24:13,868
Packing material.

00:24:13,934 --> 00:24:17,738
<i>She was killed and packed</i>

00:24:17,805 --> 00:24:20,674
<i>The cardboard and the</i>

00:24:20,741 --> 00:24:22,810
<i>to protect the body</i>
<i>from the flames.</i>

00:24:22,877 --> 00:24:24,211
Until the firemen arrived,

00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:26,313
blasting everything
with their hoses,

00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,848
which separated
her from whatever

00:24:27,915 --> 00:24:29,517
remained of the box.

00:24:30,618 --> 00:24:31,852
Congratulations.

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,188
You have just matched
wits with the CSIs.

00:24:34,255 --> 00:24:35,356
SIMMS:
Nicely done.
Hmm!

00:24:35,422 --> 00:24:37,491
Okay, so what's next?

00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:40,060
Based on what we have here,
nothing.

00:24:40,127 --> 00:24:41,729
That's as far we got.

00:24:41,795 --> 00:24:43,430
But we never
ID'd the body.

00:24:43,497 --> 00:24:44,765
Or the killer.

00:24:44,832 --> 00:24:45,900
Neither did we.

00:24:45,966 --> 00:24:48,536
What?

00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,572
That sucks.
HODGES: Yes.

00:24:51,639 --> 00:24:54,275
But what doesn't suck
is that yesterday,

00:24:54,341 --> 00:24:56,844
the city declared the building
structurally sound.

00:24:56,911 --> 00:24:58,445
So, after you have
your parents fax me

00:24:58,512 --> 00:25:00,281
their written permission
indemnifying

00:25:00,347 --> 00:25:02,449
the Crime Lab for any
injuries you may sustain,

00:25:02,516 --> 00:25:04,718
we're going on a field trip.

00:25:04,785 --> 00:25:06,487
So, my suit's done then?

00:25:06,554 --> 00:25:08,856
Great. No, I'm on my way.

00:25:08,923 --> 00:25:11,325
You didn't crease the pants
though, did you, Mom?

00:25:11,392 --> 00:25:13,327
'Cause there is nothing
worse than...

00:25:13,394 --> 00:25:15,196
(rattling, hissing)
Huh?

00:25:15,262 --> 00:25:17,731
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I'll call you back.

00:25:17,798 --> 00:25:19,733
No, no-no-no.

00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,435
Not today.

00:25:21,502 --> 00:25:23,370
♪ ♪

00:25:23,437 --> 00:25:25,439
What?

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,376
Ow.

00:25:29,443 --> 00:25:31,445
(coughing)

00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,349
Ah! No!

00:25:36,684 --> 00:25:37,952
Car trouble?

00:25:38,018 --> 00:25:39,620
Yeah, no kidding.

00:25:39,687 --> 00:25:40,955
This ruins my whole
lunch break,

00:25:41,021 --> 00:25:42,690
and I had things to do.

00:25:44,091 --> 00:25:45,659
You know, Henry, maybe
you should stay out

00:25:45,726 --> 00:25:46,894
of parking garages.

00:25:46,961 --> 00:25:50,197
Bad things seem
to happen to you there.

00:25:50,264 --> 00:25:54,869
(music plays over stereo)

00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:11,010
WILLOWS:
Henry?

00:26:11,077 --> 00:26:13,546
Hmm?
I don't mind taking
time out of my day

00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,014
to check out your radiator hose,

00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:16,649
'cause, clearly,
it means a lot to you.

00:26:16,716 --> 00:26:18,484
But you need to back off.
You are ripe.

00:26:18,551 --> 00:26:20,253
Sorry.

00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:22,688
My car's been spending
a lot of time in the shop.

00:26:22,755 --> 00:26:23,890
I just wanted to know

00:26:23,956 --> 00:26:25,458
what's wrong before I
take it in again.

00:26:25,525 --> 00:26:27,560
Well...

00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,529
I can tell you one thing.

00:26:29,595 --> 00:26:30,763
This is not defective.

00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,933
These holes are straight
and uniform,

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,368
which suggests they were

00:26:35,434 --> 00:26:37,236
mechanically introduced
from the outside in.

00:26:38,771 --> 00:26:40,006
Somebody poked my hose.

00:26:41,007 --> 00:26:42,241
(whispers):
Sorry.

00:26:42,308 --> 00:26:44,610
Sure, yeah, you could
have a shady mechanic,

00:26:44,677 --> 00:26:47,713
but as far as car sabotage
goes, this is amateur hour.

00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,215
I mean, you really
want to do some damage,

00:26:49,282 --> 00:26:50,450
you pop out a spark plug

00:26:50,516 --> 00:26:51,818
and throw rocks
into the cylinder.

00:26:51,884 --> 00:26:55,254
Radiator hose--
third grade stuff.

00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:58,191
You been pissing off a lot
of third graders lately?

00:26:59,225 --> 00:27:01,561
Hodges! (groans)

00:27:03,696 --> 00:27:05,565
You know, when you told me
to join you for some fun,

00:27:05,631 --> 00:27:07,200
I really didn't realize
it was going to be

00:27:07,266 --> 00:27:08,601
as wonderful as this.

00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,170
As your humble tech, I would
like to thank you very much

00:27:11,237 --> 00:27:13,639
for entrusting me
with such an important job.

00:27:13,706 --> 00:27:16,075
Listen, just remember
to label all

00:27:16,142 --> 00:27:18,978
bindled evidence.
Chain of custody is not just

00:27:19,045 --> 00:27:20,580
a suggestion, you know.

00:27:20,646 --> 00:27:21,581
Don't push it, Hodges.

00:27:21,647 --> 00:27:22,915
Okay.
All right.

00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:25,351
Hey.

00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:27,820
Did I miss anything?

00:27:27,887 --> 00:27:29,255
Thanks for texting me, K.

00:27:29,322 --> 00:27:31,157
Sure, I mean, the team
isn't the same without...

00:27:31,224 --> 00:27:33,025
Oh!

00:27:33,092 --> 00:27:34,727
(both laughing)

00:27:34,794 --> 00:27:36,796
Okay.

00:27:38,364 --> 00:27:39,832
Oh.
Yes.

00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:41,267
(laughing)

00:27:41,334 --> 00:27:44,370
(coughs) Fire scenes
always smell this bad?

00:27:44,437 --> 00:27:46,439
Yes.

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,008
KATY: Just let me
know if you find

00:27:49,075 --> 00:27:51,978
anything that matches the burn
pattern that we found earlier.

00:27:52,044 --> 00:27:55,715
Why do you feel
compelled to lie to us?

00:27:55,782 --> 00:27:57,817
About what, exactly?

00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:58,985
You don't have to be

00:27:59,051 --> 00:28:01,654
a real CSI to know that
you and Hodges are not.

00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,990
I suspect Hodges
is a Trace tech,

00:28:04,056 --> 00:28:07,960
because I doubt any real
CSI would wax so rhapsodic

00:28:08,027 --> 00:28:10,196
about that
particular specialty.

00:28:11,764 --> 00:28:13,166
And, clearly, that man

00:28:13,232 --> 00:28:15,201
does not relish being outdoors.

00:28:15,268 --> 00:28:16,836
(splutters)
That, and the fact

00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,571
that you two
obviously spend

00:28:18,638 --> 00:28:20,606
an inordinate amount
of time with each other,

00:28:20,673 --> 00:28:22,308
would suggest that you're

00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:24,177
most likely a lab tech, too.

00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,046
I'm DNA.

00:28:27,113 --> 00:28:28,514
So, why lie?

00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:31,150
I guess I'm afraid
that maybe I'm going

00:28:31,217 --> 00:28:33,219
to wake up one morning
and I'm going to think

00:28:33,286 --> 00:28:35,555
that I spent most of life

00:28:35,621 --> 00:28:37,990
fighting crime in a test tube.

00:28:38,057 --> 00:28:40,960
Just because something
is the size of a molecule

00:28:41,027 --> 00:28:43,496
doesn't mean that it can't be
filled with intrigue

00:28:43,563 --> 00:28:45,031
and excitement.

00:28:45,097 --> 00:28:46,833
CSIs gather
the evidence,

00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:51,104
but analysis is really
what gives it meaning.

00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,271
You need both

00:28:52,338 --> 00:28:54,107
to find the truth.

00:28:54,173 --> 00:28:55,942
DERRICK:
Found some crispy-ass denim.

00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,613
WEBSTER:
They look like men's jeans.

00:29:05,351 --> 00:29:07,386
A quarter and two pennies.

00:29:07,453 --> 00:29:09,288
Dinner's on me.

00:29:13,593 --> 00:29:14,894
Dead girl's a blonde, right?

00:29:18,998 --> 00:29:22,268
KATY: That's her.
"Stacia Borsala."

00:29:22,335 --> 00:29:23,669
Hungarian passport.

00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:27,607
Looks like I've got what's left
of a blister pack of...

00:29:27,673 --> 00:29:28,741
"Zolpidem."

00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:31,043
This is so warped,
I doubt I'm going to get

00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,579
any prints off of it.
The victim had
zolpidem in her system.

00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,214
We did it.

00:29:35,281 --> 00:29:36,649
We ID'd the vic.

00:29:36,716 --> 00:29:38,951
I'm sorry, who?

00:29:39,018 --> 00:29:41,154
In your face, CSIs.
(laughter)

00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,257
Techs and
crime cadets, we rule.

00:29:44,323 --> 00:29:45,491
Hello.

00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:52,598
Metcalf doesn't have
shigella on his hands.

00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,267
Oh, that's surprising.

00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,768
A bit of a relief, actually.

00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,136
(over phone):
Yeah, but get this.

00:29:57,203 --> 00:29:59,672
The bacteria that infected
the squad room,

00:29:59,739 --> 00:30:01,974
turns out to be the same strain
that closed down

00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:04,377
a day care center
in Summerlin last week.

00:30:06,245 --> 00:30:08,514
Hold on.

00:30:08,581 --> 00:30:10,149
A day care center, huh?

00:30:10,216 --> 00:30:12,218
Yep, half a dozen preschoolers.

00:30:12,285 --> 00:30:13,653
Must've been quite a mess.

00:30:15,421 --> 00:30:17,757
I don't think
that's a coincidence.

00:30:17,824 --> 00:30:20,259
STOKES:
The stuff that got 'em sick came

00:30:20,326 --> 00:30:21,861
from your pastry box.

00:30:21,928 --> 00:30:24,363
What's the deal, bud? Hmm?

00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,898
You get tired of the
guys in the station

00:30:25,965 --> 00:30:27,233
stealing your food,
so you thought

00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,635
you'd lace a few of your
goodies with some shigella,

00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,737
teach 'em a lesson?
No.

00:30:31,804 --> 00:30:33,272
Yes, the guys steal my food,

00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:34,807
although those lowlifes
would never admit it.

00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,209
But, look,

00:30:36,275 --> 00:30:38,678
I would never...

00:30:38,744 --> 00:30:40,012
Wh-What's shi-wha?

00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,581
Shigella-- it's a bacteria, man.

00:30:41,647 --> 00:30:43,649
Come on, now. Don't make this
any harder on yourself.

00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:44,884
What'd you do?
Did you get

00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:46,519
the sample from your
kid's day care center?

00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:48,888
I don't know where the pastries
came from, all right?

00:30:48,955 --> 00:30:50,189
I stopped eating
sugary snacks, remember?

00:30:50,256 --> 00:30:52,458
Oh, and this isn't my kid's,

00:30:52,525 --> 00:30:53,626
it's my-my girlfriend's kid.

00:30:53,693 --> 00:30:55,328
My-My ex-girlfriend,
we just broke up.

00:30:55,394 --> 00:30:57,163
But I got nothing
against the kid.

00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,865
You know, it's a good drawing,
he's talented.

00:30:58,931 --> 00:31:01,167
Was it a nasty break-up?

00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,703
Is there a pretty kind?

00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:06,506
Where can I find her?

00:31:06,572 --> 00:31:08,241
STOKES: So in revenge
for breaking up with you,

00:31:08,307 --> 00:31:09,675
you decide to give

00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:12,912
Sergeant Barclay some
delicious, homemade baked goods

00:31:12,979 --> 00:31:15,681
tainted with your
child's shigella.

00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:18,117
What did you do,
save a diarrhea diaper

00:31:18,184 --> 00:31:19,752
and lace some
in with the icing?

00:31:19,819 --> 00:31:22,421
No.
Well, what you
didn't know was

00:31:22,488 --> 00:31:26,659
that Sarge had just gone
on a little post-break-up diet.

00:31:26,726 --> 00:31:30,396
Too bad for the cops
who stole his food.

00:31:30,463 --> 00:31:32,565
Your prints were on it.

00:31:32,632 --> 00:31:36,102
It was a gift.
I left it

00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:37,437
for Barky as a
peace offering.

00:31:37,503 --> 00:31:38,738
Without telling him?
The worst

00:31:38,805 --> 00:31:41,441
you can do is have me
reprimanded for bad hygiene.

00:31:41,507 --> 00:31:43,176
You can't prove
malicious intent.

00:31:43,242 --> 00:31:45,011
That will be up to the D.A.

00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:48,080
You caused a disruption
at a police station,

00:31:48,147 --> 00:31:50,283
which could've cost lives.

00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:52,652
You're looking
at a class-B felony.

00:31:52,718 --> 00:31:55,221
Would it help if I said
I was really, really sorry?

00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:03,296
WILLOWS:
I have to say I'm impressed
with the initiative. I mean,

00:32:03,362 --> 00:32:05,832
this case had kind
of fallen off the radar.

00:32:05,898 --> 00:32:07,400
What made you
follow up on it?

00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,302
It was...

00:32:09,368 --> 00:32:11,037
you know, for the children.

00:32:11,104 --> 00:32:12,405
No, really, why?

00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,573
SIMMS:
I have sex stains

00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:14,740
right here.

00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,276
Anything usable?

00:32:17,343 --> 00:32:18,811
Maybe.

00:32:18,878 --> 00:32:20,913
I'm going to try
magnetic bead separation.

00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,548
It works best
for getting results

00:32:22,615 --> 00:32:23,883
from inhibited surfaces.

00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,486
If the inhibited surface
is a negative,

00:32:26,552 --> 00:32:27,587
then it needs

00:32:27,653 --> 00:32:30,823
a strong positive
to draw it out.

00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,059
Yeah, it also needs an outside
agent to activate

00:32:33,126 --> 00:32:37,130
the... attraction.

00:32:37,196 --> 00:32:41,467
Couldn't the outside agent
contaminate the entire process?

00:32:41,534 --> 00:32:43,336
No, it's not strong enough.

00:32:43,402 --> 00:32:45,605
In fact, it's really

00:32:45,671 --> 00:32:47,306
only there to get
things started.

00:32:47,373 --> 00:32:48,474
Sounds like a delicate process.

00:32:48,541 --> 00:32:51,511
Hmm, it is.
One that requires

00:32:51,577 --> 00:32:53,746
a lot of patience.

00:32:53,813 --> 00:32:55,581
It's worth it,

00:32:55,648 --> 00:32:57,450
because...

00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:01,654
once the two
are bound together,

00:33:01,721 --> 00:33:03,990
everything else is left behind.

00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,093
Okay.

00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,161
Let me know

00:33:08,227 --> 00:33:10,329
how it turns out.

00:33:11,564 --> 00:33:12,832
(sighs)

00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:19,038
Hey! I know what
you're doing,

00:33:19,105 --> 00:33:20,506
and I know why
you're doing it.

00:33:20,573 --> 00:33:21,941
You're trying to ruin
my date with Wendy.

00:33:22,008 --> 00:33:23,276
Well, it's not gonna happen.

00:33:23,342 --> 00:33:24,644
I followed protocol.

00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,512
I asked you if it was
cool, and you said "yes."

00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:28,848
Henry, I understand
you're having a bad day,
but I really don't see

00:33:28,915 --> 00:33:31,350
how I factor into any of it.
Oh, fine, then I'll
spell it out for you.

00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:33,886
<i>First, you monkeyed</i>
<i>with my GCMS,</i>

00:33:33,953 --> 00:33:36,289
<i>and when that didn't work,</i>
<i>you took it to the next level.</i>

00:33:36,355 --> 00:33:37,490
But that didn't
work, either.

00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,058
Our date is still on.

00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:40,493
I hired a limo.

00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,061
That's kind of flashy
for a first date.

00:33:42,128 --> 00:33:45,631
Stay out of my lab and stay
out of my life, or else.

00:33:45,698 --> 00:33:47,467
Or else what?
Back off, man.

00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:49,635
I'm a toxicologist.

00:33:49,702 --> 00:33:51,471
I know every
odorless, colorless,

00:33:51,537 --> 00:33:53,206
vomit-inducing
liquid known to man.

00:33:53,272 --> 00:33:55,141
You think about that

00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:56,943
the next time you eat lunch.

00:34:05,078 --> 00:34:07,213
SIMMS:
<i>When the metal beads are added</i>
<i>to a sample of the stain from</i>

00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,495
<i>the jeans, the DNA actually</i>
<i>binds to sites on the metal.</i>

00:34:10,562 --> 00:34:13,665
<i>And then in the magnetic field,</i>
<i>the beads with the DNA</i>

00:34:13,731 --> 00:34:15,867
<i>are separated from the rest</i>
<i>of the soup.</i>

00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:18,670
Now, this particular
sample came back

00:34:18,736 --> 00:34:22,173
as a mixture,
so we just

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,775
subtract out
the victim's profile.

00:34:23,842 --> 00:34:25,677
And we get...

00:34:27,245 --> 00:34:28,613
An unknown male.
All we've got to do

00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,381
is match it to a tenant
in the building.

00:34:30,448 --> 00:34:33,151
You just made denim
speak for the dead.

00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,188
BRASS:
<i>I'm sure</i>

00:34:37,255 --> 00:34:39,891
you'll all be willing to give us
a DNA sample to assist

00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:43,061
in our investigation.
There's a bunch of other people
whose apartments burned up.

00:34:43,128 --> 00:34:45,163
Why are we the only ones here?

00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,698
You just got lucky,
I guess.

00:34:46,764 --> 00:34:48,133
Fine, just show me
the cup to pee in

00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,702
or take my blood or whatever,
but I gotta be at my job

00:34:50,768 --> 00:34:52,237
in 20 minutes,
so can we get this done?

00:34:52,303 --> 00:34:54,205
That's the attitude.
Let's go.
All right.

00:34:57,709 --> 00:34:59,410
Hey, uh, look,

00:34:59,477 --> 00:35:01,179
giving DNA to cops... uh...

00:35:01,246 --> 00:35:03,748
The way I see it, that's
an invasion of my privacy,

00:35:03,815 --> 00:35:06,151
so I'm going to decline.

00:35:06,217 --> 00:35:07,685
You know,
just on principle.

00:35:07,752 --> 00:35:09,554
Sure, I respect your rights.

00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:11,790
What's your name?
Melvin Dodge.

00:35:11,856 --> 00:35:13,291
Melvin Dodge.

00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:15,226
Apartment 3C.

00:35:15,293 --> 00:35:17,095
I just have a few
things to follow up on,

00:35:17,162 --> 00:35:18,630
so why don't we have a chat?

00:35:18,696 --> 00:35:19,831
Just you and me.

00:35:19,898 --> 00:35:22,500
Okay, okay.

00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:24,335
According to the landlord,
you moved in

00:35:24,402 --> 00:35:26,204
three days before the fire.

00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:27,405
Boy, that's a tough break.

00:35:27,472 --> 00:35:29,641
Has the town been treating
you any better since?

00:35:29,707 --> 00:35:32,844
Yeah, I got a job dealing craps
over at the Palermo.

00:35:32,911 --> 00:35:34,312
They let me go, though.

00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:35,814
Layoffs.
There is a recession going on.

00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,183
Maybe that's not
the best time to move.

00:35:38,249 --> 00:35:40,385
Three days
before the fire,

00:35:40,452 --> 00:35:41,786
that's barely enough
time to unpack.

00:35:41,853 --> 00:35:44,122
Yeah, I was totally
living out

00:35:44,189 --> 00:35:45,190
of boxes.
Boxes?

00:35:45,256 --> 00:35:47,926
You know what I
hate about boxes?

00:35:47,992 --> 00:35:50,628
The stuff they put in them-- the
peanuts-- they get everywhere.

00:35:50,695 --> 00:35:51,963
I learned
something about them.

00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,631
You know, they're not
made out of Styrofoam.

00:35:53,698 --> 00:35:56,201
To be friendly to the
environment, they're made
out of cornstarch.

00:35:56,267 --> 00:35:58,803
They keep things from
getting crushed, and also,

00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:01,639
keeps a dead girl
from going up in flames.

00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:04,442
Look, I can get your DNA
in about ten seconds.

00:36:04,509 --> 00:36:06,478
Tell me what happened
right now,

00:36:06,544 --> 00:36:08,079
and maybe we can
knock the charge

00:36:08,146 --> 00:36:09,414
down to involuntary
manslaughter.

00:36:11,282 --> 00:36:13,017
That's a break for you.

00:36:16,588 --> 00:36:18,156
I didn't know
she was going to die.

00:36:18,223 --> 00:36:19,891
I met her at Haze.

00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:21,192
She was new in town, too.

00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:22,393
She didn't know
anybody, either.

00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,230
We started drinking. A lot.

00:36:25,296 --> 00:36:27,966
<i>She got flirty. She asked me</i>
<i>if I had any drugs.</i>

00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:31,469
<i>I told her I had</i>
<i>zolpidem back at my place.</i>

00:36:31,536 --> 00:36:33,805
<i>She starts talking about all</i>
<i>the dirty things we can do</i>

00:36:33,872 --> 00:36:35,173
<i>if we popped a couple.</i>

00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,574
<i>15 minutes later,</i>
<i>she's doing things to me</i>

00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:38,810
<i>I've only seen online.</i>

00:36:38,877 --> 00:36:42,447
<i>Then I woke up</i>
<i>the next morning...</i>

00:36:42,514 --> 00:36:44,015
Babe?

00:36:44,082 --> 00:36:45,550
<i>And there she was.</i>
Hey, come on.

00:36:45,617 --> 00:36:47,919
Hey, wake up.
<i>Dead.</i>

00:36:47,986 --> 00:36:49,187
<i>I don't know what happened.</i>

00:36:49,254 --> 00:36:51,823
<i>She said that she had</i>
<i>done it before.</i>

00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,425
<i>I guess I just wasn't</i>
<i>thinking straight.</i>

00:36:54,492 --> 00:36:58,730
So you put her body
in one of your boxes, figured

00:36:58,797 --> 00:37:00,632
you'd throw it
in a Dumpster later?

00:37:00,698 --> 00:37:02,000
Was that the plan?

00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:04,903
I guess so.

00:37:04,969 --> 00:37:07,372
But then, I got home that night

00:37:07,438 --> 00:37:10,442
and I saw that the whole place
was going up in flames.

00:37:10,508 --> 00:37:14,012
<i>The fireman came up</i>
<i>and he told me that</i>

00:37:14,078 --> 00:37:16,381
<i>my apartment had been</i>
<i>completely destroyed.</i>

00:37:16,448 --> 00:37:19,184
I kind of felt like
I got lucky again.

00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,452
How do you feel now?

00:37:23,188 --> 00:37:25,623
Let's do some
writing.

00:37:27,425 --> 00:37:30,528
This guy's life
is totally over.

00:37:30,595 --> 00:37:34,432
How do you deal with this
day after day?

00:37:34,499 --> 00:37:37,302
It's good work when you know
you're on the right side.

00:37:44,476 --> 00:37:46,911
Captain Brass?

00:37:46,978 --> 00:37:48,913
I just want to say that
I think it's awesome

00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,215
the way you've pulled
your life back together.

00:37:50,281 --> 00:37:52,217
Did you get

00:37:52,283 --> 00:37:53,952
into a program?

00:37:54,018 --> 00:37:55,653
Who are you?

00:37:57,956 --> 00:37:59,624
And what's he been telling you?

00:38:13,304 --> 00:38:15,106
♪ ♪

00:38:15,173 --> 00:38:17,275
What?

00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:20,645
Oh, come on...

00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,782
Oh, no way.

00:38:23,848 --> 00:38:26,117
This isn't funny!

00:38:29,254 --> 00:38:31,122
What the...?!

00:38:31,189 --> 00:38:34,759
(grunting)

00:38:34,826 --> 00:38:37,695
(exclaims)

00:38:37,762 --> 00:38:39,831
(whimpers):
Help. My face...

00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:42,267
Help.

00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:43,468
(banging)

00:38:43,535 --> 00:38:45,937
Lab tech down! Aah!

00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:49,407
Wait, is that acetone?

00:38:49,474 --> 00:38:50,809
Ah...

00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:54,846
It is the best way to
dissolve cyanoacrylate, Henry.

00:38:54,913 --> 00:38:56,648
Yeah-- ah!

00:38:56,714 --> 00:38:57,916
That's toxic.

00:38:57,982 --> 00:39:00,952
Well, not so much, if you
keep your mouth closed

00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:03,154
and cover your
eyes with that.

00:39:03,221 --> 00:39:04,889
Okay.
Lucky for you,

00:39:04,956 --> 00:39:07,859
I was feeling better and decided
to come to work today.

00:39:07,926 --> 00:39:09,994
There's no telling how long
you could've been stuck here.

00:39:10,061 --> 00:39:12,230
Obviously,

00:39:12,297 --> 00:39:17,101
someone has not been adhering to
lab policy against pranks,

00:39:17,168 --> 00:39:21,439
which is strange because we're
usually such a cohesive group.

00:39:21,506 --> 00:39:24,109
Please stop.
I think it's a terrible

00:39:24,175 --> 00:39:27,378
injustice, because you...

00:39:27,445 --> 00:39:28,780
(groans)

00:39:28,847 --> 00:39:30,048
...are the glue

00:39:30,115 --> 00:39:32,450
that holds this
whole place together.

00:39:34,085 --> 00:39:36,154
Let's see.

00:39:36,221 --> 00:39:38,623
Mm-hmm. Looks like someone

00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,258
shimmed the lock, then

00:39:40,325 --> 00:39:41,926
applied contact adhesive

00:39:41,993 --> 00:39:43,995
to the interior surfaces
of your locker.

00:39:44,062 --> 00:39:46,397
Yeah, well,
I have a very good idea who.

00:39:47,499 --> 00:39:49,400
Stick it to him, Henry.

00:39:54,105 --> 00:39:57,142
Hey. I saw you and Henry

00:39:57,208 --> 00:40:00,044
in the hall before...
Look, I haven't been
messing with Henry.

00:40:00,111 --> 00:40:02,080
I'm not trying to spoil
your date, and I hope that

00:40:02,147 --> 00:40:03,882
you guys have
a very nice life together.

00:40:03,948 --> 00:40:06,818
I really wasn't trying
to blame you for anything.

00:40:06,885 --> 00:40:09,053
I was just checking in.

00:40:11,623 --> 00:40:13,158
Why are your hands
in your pockets?

00:40:13,224 --> 00:40:16,127
Because I'm
socially awkward,

00:40:16,194 --> 00:40:18,963
and it gives me
a sense of security.

00:40:26,871 --> 00:40:29,674
You know,
after Henry accused me,

00:40:29,741 --> 00:40:31,643
I began to suspect
that someone was trying

00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:33,845
to pin their
practical jokes on me.

00:40:33,912 --> 00:40:37,081
So I mixed up
a little something called

00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:39,417
"detection spray" and I put
it all over the surfaces

00:40:39,484 --> 00:40:42,454
that I felt that Henry would be
most vulnerable to pranks,

00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,788
including his locker.

00:40:43,855 --> 00:40:45,757
<i>It's essentially</i>
<i>a ninhydrin solution,</i>

00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,425
<i>which goes on clear,</i>
<i>then reacts</i>

00:40:47,492 --> 00:40:49,093
<i>with the amino salts</i>
<i>in perspiration,</i>

00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,696
<i>leaving a stain on anyone</i>
<i>who touches it.</i>

00:40:51,763 --> 00:40:55,667
And the more that the perp
tries to wash it off,

00:40:55,733 --> 00:40:57,502
the more the stain spreads.

00:40:57,569 --> 00:40:59,137
That's really fascinating.
I should go.

00:40:59,204 --> 00:41:00,438
It can last up
to five days.

00:41:00,505 --> 00:41:03,308
You may want to wear a dress
with pockets tonight.

00:41:13,718 --> 00:41:15,120
I'm not proud of this.

00:41:15,186 --> 00:41:17,322
Then why

00:41:17,388 --> 00:41:20,458
did you do it?
Because, originally,

00:41:20,525 --> 00:41:22,527
I really wanted
to go out with Henry.

00:41:22,594 --> 00:41:25,530
Because he's everything that
I know I should be looking for.

00:41:25,597 --> 00:41:27,365
He's adorable

00:41:27,432 --> 00:41:30,368
and charming and funny and

00:41:30,435 --> 00:41:33,138
sweet and nice to me...
Okay, I get it.

00:41:33,204 --> 00:41:35,140
He's peachy.
But then, I realized

00:41:35,206 --> 00:41:39,310
that what
I'm supposed to want...

00:41:39,377 --> 00:41:42,046
isn't what I do want.

00:41:43,114 --> 00:41:44,682
So...

00:41:44,749 --> 00:41:46,284
basically,
I did the mature thing

00:41:46,351 --> 00:41:48,586
and I tortured the poor guy
with practical jokes all day,

00:41:48,653 --> 00:41:51,389
thinking that it might make him
cancel the date.

00:41:51,456 --> 00:41:54,492
That does sound like
something I'd do.

00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:57,462
All right, Hodges,
Henry tells me that you

00:41:57,529 --> 00:41:59,164
reprogrammed the GCMS.

00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,565
And glued my face to my locker

00:42:00,632 --> 00:42:02,033
and poked my hose.

00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,701
WILLOWS:
Whatever. If this is
true, you're looking

00:42:03,768 --> 00:42:05,503
at a formal reprimand and
days off. Did you do it?

00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,372
SIMMS:
Can I just say something?

00:42:08,273 --> 00:42:10,675
I am so sorry...

00:42:10,742 --> 00:42:12,844
That you didn't
stop me earlier.

00:42:12,911 --> 00:42:14,345
You see, Wendy

00:42:14,412 --> 00:42:17,482
suspected what I was up to, and
she was urging me to come clean.

00:42:17,549 --> 00:42:20,018
I swear,
it'll never happen again.

00:42:20,084 --> 00:42:21,186
Mea culpa.

00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,022
Can you forgive me?

00:42:26,224 --> 00:42:27,492
This is going to go on

00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:28,593
your permanent record.

00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,861
You got your

00:42:29,928 --> 00:42:31,362
confession-- happy?

00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:32,363
Hmm.

00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:35,266
Nobody likes a snitch.

00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:36,334
(whimpers)

00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:40,972
(Hodges clears throat)

00:42:43,842 --> 00:42:47,011
Henry, I am so, so sorry.

00:42:47,078 --> 00:42:48,746
I guess this means
our date's off?

00:42:48,813 --> 00:42:51,883
Oh, yeah.

00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,685
I guess I need some time

00:42:53,751 --> 00:42:55,820
for my face to heal!

00:42:56,855 --> 00:42:58,156
Can I get a rain check?

00:43:04,129 --> 00:43:05,130
Mmm!

00:43:11,936 --> 00:43:13,963
It's never going to happen.
