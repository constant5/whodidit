00:00:02,215 --> 00:00:05,413
(players shouting, calling plays
distantly, echoing)

00:00:07,114 --> 00:00:09,517
(heart beating very slowly)

00:00:09,584 --> 00:00:11,419
(distant, echoing shouts
and slow heartbeat continue)

00:00:11,486 --> 00:00:12,653
(fading in):
Green 30!

00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,722
Green 30.
Sweep right!
Watch the backs!

00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:16,591
Set! Hut!

00:00:18,392 --> 00:00:20,261
(spectators cheering)

00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,033
ANNOUNCER: <i>Burns is tackled...</i>
<i>he's goin' for it!</i>

00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,002
<i>Oh!</i>
<i>He's hit by the Aztec safety.</i>

00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,403
Time-out! Time-out!

00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,405
(whistle blows)
Give me a time-out! Kayle!

00:00:31,472 --> 00:00:32,740
(air horn blows)

00:00:32,807 --> 00:00:34,909
All right, look, this is it.

00:00:34,976 --> 00:00:37,645
This is it.
Just stay focused, son.

00:00:37,712 --> 00:00:39,647
It's our will versus their will.

00:00:39,714 --> 00:00:41,883
Run 2-22 Strike.

00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:45,453
(air horn blasting)

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,222
(quarterback calling play)

00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:53,361
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Nice snap, dropping back...</i>

00:00:53,427 --> 00:00:56,397
<i>He's got a man open downfield!</i>

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,434
<i>Oh! He got it! Touchdown!</i>

00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:02,403
(whistle blows, cheering)

00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,841
(cheering wildly)

00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,951
(shrill beeping)

00:01:22,156 --> 00:01:24,158
(beeping continues)

00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:40,474
(beeping continues)

00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:42,543
(water running)

00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:03,831
(alarm blaring)

00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,340
(alarm continues)

00:02:36,864 --> 00:02:39,066
Coach?

00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:41,135
Coach, you okay?

00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,050
You know the Mustangs
were 7 and oh this season?

00:02:56,117 --> 00:02:57,819
On their way
to winning their
third consecutive

00:02:57,885 --> 00:02:59,387
Silver State Bowl.

00:02:59,453 --> 00:03:00,922
Didn't realize you
were a fan, David.

00:03:00,988 --> 00:03:04,058
My father took me to my first
game when I was seven.

00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,726
And it was Coach Miller's
first game, too.

00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:10,298
My father loved this man.

00:03:40,461 --> 00:03:42,630

00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:08,890

00:04:23,704 --> 00:04:26,741
Spatter is concentrated on
the pillow, the headboard;

00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:30,611
there's cast-off on the
ceiling and the wall.

00:04:30,678 --> 00:04:32,980
(thudding, squishing)

00:04:33,047 --> 00:04:35,616
Looks like he was attacked
while he was sleeping.

00:04:35,683 --> 00:04:37,752
A large blood pool
under his head.

00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,088
Looks like he laid there
for hours, bleeding.

00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,824
And still managed
to get out of bed

00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,026
when his alarm went
off at 6:00 a.m.

00:04:45,092 --> 00:04:47,028
I turned it off.

00:04:47,094 --> 00:04:49,263
There wasn't any blood
on any of the phones.

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,098
But he still had
the wherewithal

00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,334
to pour himself a cup
of coffee and a bowl of cereal,

00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:55,336
but not call 911.

00:04:55,403 --> 00:04:57,505
You know how it is
with head wounds.

00:04:57,572 --> 00:04:59,006
Yeah.

00:04:59,073 --> 00:05:01,776
All right. I got a couple
shoe impressions.

00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:02,944
Coach Miller was barefoot,

00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,179
so this has got
to belong to the killer.

00:05:09,784 --> 00:05:11,686
I spoke to
the home security company.

00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:14,489
The system was triggered
at 6:04 a.m.

00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:15,723
So, the security system
was on last night?

00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,024
Suggests the killer
knew the code,

00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:19,560
otherwise, how would they
get in and out of here

00:05:19,627 --> 00:05:21,796
without setting it off?

00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,498
LANGSTON:
I was teaching at WLVU

00:05:23,564 --> 00:05:26,534
when Coach Miller won his
second conference title.

00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:29,504
Everybody loved him,
treated him like a god.

00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,342

Not unless
Nemo was a Beemo.

00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,409
Some kids spotted the car
over the weekend.

00:06:43,476 --> 00:06:45,845
Couldn't get a crane here
until this morning.

00:06:45,912 --> 00:06:47,280
Ran the tags.

00:06:47,346 --> 00:06:50,950
Fleet vehicle
from Vegas Legacy Motors.

00:06:51,017 --> 00:06:53,352
Reported stolen
about six months ago.

00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,125
(sniffs)

00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:01,127
Phew! She's been down
there a while.

00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:11,070
This window's
rolled down,

00:07:11,137 --> 00:07:13,406
that one's broken.

00:07:13,473 --> 00:07:14,907
She had two escape routes.

00:07:14,974 --> 00:07:18,344
It looks like she might've
gotten stuck in her seat belt.

00:07:34,594 --> 00:07:37,663
"Paige Hammer, 19."

00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,031
North Dakota license.

00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:42,568
Possibly a tourist
or a new resident.

00:07:42,635 --> 00:07:44,604
SIDLE:
Both airbags are deployed.

00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,206
The airbags only go off if
someone's sitting in the seat.

00:07:47,273 --> 00:07:49,208
She wasn't alone.

00:07:49,275 --> 00:07:51,043
Guess we're looking for the one
who got away.

00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,413
So, did you see anyone else
when you pulled up?

00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,848
SECURITY OFFICER:
No, sir, just Coach.

00:07:55,915 --> 00:07:57,817
And I usually keep an extra
eye out for his house.

00:07:57,884 --> 00:07:59,685
You know, he spends a
lot of time on the road,

00:07:59,752 --> 00:08:01,554
so I take in his
newspaper and his mail.

00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:03,723
Then I guess you're the one
who turned off the alarm?

00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:04,891
Was that bad?

00:08:04,957 --> 00:08:05,992
Yeah.

00:08:06,058 --> 00:08:07,760
So, is it just you
who knows the code

00:08:07,827 --> 00:08:09,862
or everyone
in the department?

00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:11,797
Pretty much
the whole department.

00:08:11,864 --> 00:08:14,233
Everybody loves Coach M
and the Mustangs.

00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,969
Okay, I'm gonna need a list
of everyone.

00:08:17,036 --> 00:08:19,438
MAN: I got 'em
right here.

00:08:19,505 --> 00:08:21,474
Put that on for
Coach, all right?

00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,476
Did everybody get one?
Did everybody get an armband?

00:08:23,543 --> 00:08:26,179
Yeah, I got one.
Did you get an armband?

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,081
Did everybody get one?
She needs one.

00:08:33,286 --> 00:08:35,321
I'm sorry for your loss.

00:08:35,388 --> 00:08:37,390
It's more than a loss.
It's a tragedy.

00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:39,358
Coach took a third-rate team
with players

00:08:39,425 --> 00:08:42,328
no other school wanted,
turned them into champions

00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:45,164
with real futures,
real degrees.

00:08:45,231 --> 00:08:46,732
He was one of a kind.

00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,401
I'm Catherine Willows
with the Crime Lab.

00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:49,836
And you are...?

00:08:49,902 --> 00:08:51,571
I'm Pal Arnold.

00:08:51,637 --> 00:08:53,239
I'm president of
the Booster Club.

00:08:53,306 --> 00:08:55,174
Did you know Coach Miller well?

00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:56,542
Like a blood brother.

00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:57,844
Did he have any family?

00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,545
A wife, any kids?

00:08:59,612 --> 00:09:01,914
Yeah, about 85 of 'em;
the whole roster.

00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:04,517
Coach always said, "Your
team is your family."

00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:05,585
Am I right?

00:09:05,651 --> 00:09:06,919
That's right.
That's right.

00:09:06,986 --> 00:09:09,155
His wife passed on
about ten years ago,

00:09:09,222 --> 00:09:10,456
and they had no kids.

00:09:10,523 --> 00:09:12,225
So he lived alone?

00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,359
I wouldn't say that.

00:09:13,426 --> 00:09:14,594
House was always full.

00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,095
It's the way
he liked it.

00:09:16,162 --> 00:09:17,530
Would you happen to know

00:09:17,597 --> 00:09:20,700
if any of his extended family
had a key to the house?

00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:21,734
They kind of all did.

00:09:21,801 --> 00:09:23,035
What do you mean by that?

00:09:23,102 --> 00:09:24,403
Let me show you, can I...?

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,305
No, no, just tell me.

00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:29,075
Um... you see those three
rocks there in front?

00:09:29,142 --> 00:09:33,880
Uh, there's a small rock,
uh, on the left-hand side.

00:09:33,946 --> 00:09:35,047
That's the
one, right...

00:09:35,114 --> 00:09:37,950
Right... your right.
That's it.

00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:57,069
C.O.D.'s exsanguination
due to both sharp force

00:09:57,136 --> 00:09:58,938
and blunt force trauma.

00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:00,439
Coach was struck

00:10:00,506 --> 00:10:01,841
at least a dozen times.

00:10:01,908 --> 00:10:03,009
Lot of rage here.

00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:04,410
Agreed.

00:10:04,477 --> 00:10:05,845
The multiple impacts
crushed his skull

00:10:05,912 --> 00:10:08,648
and drove bone fragments
into the brain,

00:10:08,714 --> 00:10:10,783
causing catastrophic
hemorrhaging.

00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,518
<i>It's like when you</i>
<i>push your finger</i>

00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:14,153
<i>into a hard-boiled egg--</i>

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,456
<i>the shell cracks,</i>
<i>but the pieces stay in place.</i>

00:10:17,523 --> 00:10:19,525
Thanks for ruining
another breakfast for me.

00:10:19,592 --> 00:10:21,360
It's what I do.

00:10:21,427 --> 00:10:23,029
What about the weapon?

00:10:23,095 --> 00:10:24,597
Well, you're looking
for a wide,

00:10:24,664 --> 00:10:27,133
flat object with
narrow sharp edges.

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,768
I can't be any more
specific than that.

00:10:28,835 --> 00:10:30,169
Okay.

00:10:30,236 --> 00:10:33,473
Come on. You're not gonna ask me
about the zombie thing?

00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:35,775
You're obviously eager
to tell me.

00:10:35,842 --> 00:10:40,146
Well, damage was predominantly
on the right side

00:10:40,213 --> 00:10:42,215
of the brain to the neocortex

00:10:42,281 --> 00:10:45,318
<i>which controls thought,</i>
<i>language and reason.</i>

00:10:45,384 --> 00:10:47,386
<i>It was almost completely</i>
<i>destroyed.</i>

00:10:47,453 --> 00:10:49,288
But the paleocortex,

00:10:49,355 --> 00:10:51,858
which lies beneath it,
remained intact.

00:10:51,924 --> 00:10:56,162
<i>The paleocortex controls</i>
<i>learned instinct and rituals,</i>

00:10:56,229 --> 00:10:58,531
which explains why the victim
was able to brush his teeth

00:10:58,598 --> 00:11:00,366
and eat his breakfast

00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:02,735
without noticing
that he was bleeding to death.

00:11:02,802 --> 00:11:05,838
They never seem to get
that right in zombie movies.

00:11:08,841 --> 00:11:11,144
Most of the mud and
silt is over here.

00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,246
Tells me the car settled

00:11:13,312 --> 00:11:15,348
driver's-side down
on the lake bed.

00:11:15,414 --> 00:11:16,682
Yeah, which
eliminates using

00:11:16,749 --> 00:11:18,417
the driver's-side window
as an escape route.

00:11:28,161 --> 00:11:29,629
Lots of diced glass.

00:11:29,695 --> 00:11:31,764
Must be from the broken window.

00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,467
It is not easy
to break one of these.

00:11:34,534 --> 00:11:36,369
I wonder how she did it.

00:11:49,448 --> 00:11:51,417
Hey, Sara...
Hmm?

00:11:51,484 --> 00:11:52,952
Got a .38 Smith &amp; Wesson.

00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:55,421
What? We got to open it up
right now

00:11:55,488 --> 00:11:59,158
and get the cartridge cases out
before the gun totally rusts.

00:12:00,326 --> 00:12:01,861
(phone chirps)

00:12:01,928 --> 00:12:05,464
Mandy, we just recovered a .38
revolver that's been in water.

00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:08,401
We need a rush on
getting it processed.

00:12:08,467 --> 00:12:10,469
MANDY (over phone):
Okay, got it.

00:12:11,871 --> 00:12:13,706
It's a five-shot.

00:12:13,773 --> 00:12:16,042
Four live rounds.

00:12:16,108 --> 00:12:17,276
One cartridge has been fired.

00:12:17,343 --> 00:12:20,112
This is the most
excitement I've had in weeks.

00:12:21,614 --> 00:12:23,449
Oh, okay.
Well, the prints for this

00:12:23,516 --> 00:12:26,118
are gonna be a long shot,
but we'll give it a try.

00:12:45,004 --> 00:12:48,341
(door slides open,
then closed)

00:12:55,748 --> 00:12:58,918
That's a lot of computing power
for a football coach.

00:12:58,985 --> 00:13:01,154
LANGSTON:
It's a complex game.

00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,322
Two teams, 11 players,

00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:07,360
each play crafted with
multiple levels of redundancy.

00:13:07,426 --> 00:13:11,531
And yet, most academics and
intellectuals prefer baseball.

00:13:11,597 --> 00:13:13,633
I suppose for the poetry.

00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:15,601
I just like to watch the guys
hit each other.

00:13:15,668 --> 00:13:16,669
And I like their butts.

00:13:18,437 --> 00:13:20,139
Check out this photo.

00:13:21,741 --> 00:13:24,610
LANGSTON:
Okay, in the photograph,
there are two trophies

00:13:24,677 --> 00:13:26,646
and a football
on the top shelf.

00:13:26,712 --> 00:13:31,684
The Coach of the Year trophy
and the football are missing.

00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:41,360
The remaining trophy
has been moved.

00:13:43,362 --> 00:13:45,298
What do you think?

00:13:45,364 --> 00:13:47,867
Think it might be a burglary
gone bad.

00:13:58,411 --> 00:14:01,948
The cover-up always
leaves behind more evidence.

00:14:06,143 --> 00:14:07,645
BRASS:
<i>See, one of the downsides</i>

00:14:07,712 --> 00:14:08,913
to working
in law enforcement

00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,115
is that your fingerprints
are on file.

00:14:11,182 --> 00:14:13,851
So when you break the
law, you're screwed.

00:14:16,187 --> 00:14:17,355
Okay, listen, I...

00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:20,625
Like I said before,
I'm a huge Mustang fan,

00:14:20,691 --> 00:14:24,295
and while I was waiting for your
guys to arrive at the scene,

00:14:24,362 --> 00:14:28,266
I... may have touched
one of Coach M's trophies.

00:14:28,332 --> 00:14:29,967
(wry laugh)

00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:31,202
Oh, you did more than touch.

00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:32,470
I don't know
anything about that.

00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:33,938
Are you sure?

00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:36,540
'Cause look at the big bid
I just put on BarterBarrel.com.

00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:41,879
Captain, do you know
how much the university

00:14:41,946 --> 00:14:43,180
pays campus security?

00:14:43,247 --> 00:14:46,917
Well, I know that prison inmates
make 15 cents an hour.

00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:48,352
Is it less than that?

00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:51,055
Look, here's what I
think happened.

00:14:51,122 --> 00:14:52,723
I think you broke into
Coach Miller's house--

00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,392
you already admitted to
having the alarm code--

00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,028
you snatched up
some valuable memorabilia.

00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:58,596
You went upstairs
hunting for some more.

00:14:58,663 --> 00:15:00,765
Coach Miller wakes up,
you panic, and you grease him.

00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:01,766
No, no.

00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:03,034
I loved Coach Miller, all right?

00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,235
Don't go around saying that.

00:15:07,972 --> 00:15:10,207
All right, I'll cop
to stealing the football.

00:15:10,274 --> 00:15:12,977
Okay, what about the big trophy,
the Coach of the Year?

00:15:13,044 --> 00:15:14,545
No, I only stole the football.

00:15:14,612 --> 00:15:16,814
I mean, the trophy
would've been tempting,

00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:20,351
but... I don't even
remember it being there.

00:15:23,988 --> 00:15:27,124
C.O.D. should come as no
surprise; she drowned.

00:15:27,191 --> 00:15:29,760
One of my greatest
fears, by the way.

00:15:29,827 --> 00:15:32,830
Can't definitively tell you if
she engaged in sexual activity

00:15:32,897 --> 00:15:34,332
immediately
prior to death,

00:15:34,398 --> 00:15:36,133
but I did find this
wedged between

00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,436
her central
and lateral incisors.

00:15:38,502 --> 00:15:40,905
Oh, pubic hair.

00:15:40,972 --> 00:15:42,239
I'll get it to Wendy.

00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:48,212
I also found something
in her right main stem bronchi.

00:15:50,214 --> 00:15:51,616
Tempered auto glass.

00:15:53,084 --> 00:15:54,685
ROBBINS: <i>She aspirated it</i>
<i>while drowning.</i>

00:15:54,752 --> 00:15:57,088
<i>Glass particles wash</i>
<i>down the trachea,</i>

00:15:57,154 --> 00:15:58,923
<i>eventually wedging</i>
<i>in a pathway</i>

00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,425
<i>of the main-stem bronchi.</i>

00:16:01,492 --> 00:16:03,294
Confirms that
the passenger window was broken

00:16:03,361 --> 00:16:04,462
<i>after</i> the car was submerged.

00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:05,830
ROBBINS:
Mm-hmm.

00:16:05,896 --> 00:16:07,431
Thanks, Doc.
Mm-hmm.

00:16:07,498 --> 00:16:09,300
Hey, Sara.

00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:10,501
Ooh. How's it going?

00:16:10,568 --> 00:16:12,470
I'm, uh, kind of
underwater on this one.

00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:13,471
Yeah, looks like it.

00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:14,472
Have fun on campus.

00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:16,474
Will do.

00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,877
Hey, Doc, are these the casts
from Coach Miller's head wounds?

00:16:19,944 --> 00:16:22,647
Yeah. You got a
weapon to compare?

00:16:22,713 --> 00:16:27,051
No... No, just a hunch.

00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:54,478
WILLOWS:
<i>So Coach Miller was killed</i>

00:16:54,545 --> 00:16:56,213
with his Coach of
the Year trophy.

00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,516
Mm-hmm.
That can't be a coincidence.

00:16:58,582 --> 00:17:00,885
No, I think Coach
knew his killer.

00:17:00,952 --> 00:17:03,421
And given his penchant for
treating everyone like family,

00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,157
that narrows our
suspect pool down to...

00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:07,758
The entire university.
Yeah.

00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:10,628
Bloody shoe impression
you found in the bedroom

00:17:10,695 --> 00:17:12,964
is a size 12 Jupiter
Athletic Gear

00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,999
Galaxy One.

00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:16,100
Last year's model.

00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:17,835
Mine's current.

00:17:17,902 --> 00:17:19,537
And I'm sure this is
leading somewhere.

00:17:19,604 --> 00:17:21,405
Yeah, to the gross
overcommercialization

00:17:21,472 --> 00:17:22,974
and corruption
of college athletics.

00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,012
See, uh, Jupiter sponsors
WLVU football.

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,581
Yeah, I contacted the
Mustang's equipment manager.

00:17:30,648 --> 00:17:32,016
And he said that
Jupiter did donate

00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,885
a pair of Galaxy Ones to
every player on the team.

00:17:34,952 --> 00:17:37,254
How many of them wore size 12s?

00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:39,590
Five. Four of which have
gone on to graduate,

00:17:39,657 --> 00:17:41,926
which is not unusual for
Coach Miller's players.

00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:45,763
Which leaves us with the star
running back Calvin Crook.

00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,633
Is Mr. MVP
living up to his name?

00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:52,870
Where's Archie?

00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:55,072
He's at a technical conference
in Sioux City, Iowa.

00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:57,541
How can I help you?

00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:02,013
I'm interested in any e-mails

00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:04,849
between Coach M
and Calvin Crook.

00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:06,384
Coach had two separate
e-mail accounts.

00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,119
One was an ".edu"
through the university,

00:18:08,185 --> 00:18:09,487
the other was personal.

00:18:09,553 --> 00:18:10,688
I found an e-mail trail
between

00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:12,857
the two of them
back in April.
April?

00:18:12,923 --> 00:18:14,091
Yeah, got a little heated.

00:18:14,158 --> 00:18:15,459
That's around the time
of the NFL draft.

00:18:15,526 --> 00:18:17,094
Rumor had it that

00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:19,163
Calvin was gonna skip out
on his senior year

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,498
and enter the draft early.

00:18:20,564 --> 00:18:21,599
Money, money, money.

00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,301
But he stayed.

00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:25,036
Yeah, and he lost
some of his magic.

00:18:25,102 --> 00:18:27,538
Wasn't being played as often,
and he was playing for free.

00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:30,474
Most of their back and forth
was on the university account,

00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,976
the majority of which

00:18:32,043 --> 00:18:34,278
was between the coach
and Calvin's reps.

00:18:34,345 --> 00:18:36,747
But... check these out.

00:18:36,814 --> 00:18:39,717
LANGSTON:
"Coach, Agents are blowing
up my cell saying I can

00:18:39,784 --> 00:18:43,120
"enter the draft now and sign
for three years, five mil.

00:18:43,187 --> 00:18:44,488
Calvin."

00:18:44,555 --> 00:18:46,123
Now comes the tough love.

00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,359
"The Mustangs are
family, Calvin,

00:18:48,426 --> 00:18:49,894
"and that has more
value than money.

00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:51,095
"Money waits
for talent.

00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:52,430
"Finish your education,

00:18:52,496 --> 00:18:54,098
"not just for the team
but for yourself

00:18:54,165 --> 00:18:55,766
"so you'll have a career
after football.

00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,501
Coach M."

00:18:57,568 --> 00:19:00,104
Five minutes later, the
Coach sends Calvin a link

00:19:00,171 --> 00:19:02,306
to this <i>Las Vegas Globe</i>
article.

00:19:02,373 --> 00:19:04,775
22-year-old restaurant
worker found in the lake.

00:19:04,842 --> 00:19:06,277
Single gunshot wound.

00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:08,412
Andrew Jimenez.

00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:10,648
Calvin never mentions
the draft again.

00:19:10,715 --> 00:19:12,450
Because of this article?

00:19:12,516 --> 00:19:15,186
Well, something made him
walk away from five million.

00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:21,192
CALVIN:
I know you're hurting.

00:19:21,258 --> 00:19:23,027
I'm hurting.

00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:25,429
But we have to remember
what Coach M taught us.

00:19:25,496 --> 00:19:28,466
What he expected
from each of us.

00:19:28,532 --> 00:19:30,635
We play in that game
on Saturday

00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:32,503
and we play <i>hard.</i>

00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,039
And we honor Coach M
by drilling

00:19:35,106 --> 00:19:37,241
the Cougars into the ground.

00:19:37,308 --> 00:19:39,076
What did he always tell us?

00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:41,045
"God didn't put us on
this Earth to be losers."

00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:43,614
So what are we going to do?!
ALL:
Win!

00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:45,616
That's right!

00:19:45,683 --> 00:19:47,385
Calvin...

00:19:47,451 --> 00:19:48,886
I'm Nick Stokes.

00:19:48,953 --> 00:19:50,921
This is Ray Langston,
we're with the Crime Lab.

00:19:50,988 --> 00:19:52,957
We need to ask you
a few questions, okay?

00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:54,392
Sure, sure.
Yeah, ask away.

00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,561
Last season you received
some Jupiter Athletic Gear,

00:19:57,628 --> 00:20:00,831
specifically a pair
of Galaxy Ones.
Yeah.

00:20:00,898 --> 00:20:02,300
We need to examine them.

00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:04,001
Well, I don't know what that
has to do with anything.

00:20:04,068 --> 00:20:06,070
And I'd love to help you
guys out, but I tossed
those months back.

00:20:06,137 --> 00:20:08,039
The more expensive
the kicks, the quicker

00:20:08,105 --> 00:20:09,640
they wear out
I guess, huh?

00:20:09,707 --> 00:20:12,510
Hey, what can you tell us
about Andrew Jimenez?

00:20:12,576 --> 00:20:13,744
I'm sorry, who?

00:20:13,811 --> 00:20:14,912
Andrew Jimenez.

00:20:14,979 --> 00:20:16,847
He was a waiter
at Lakeside Pizza.

00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:18,549
Coach Miller
sent you an article

00:20:18,616 --> 00:20:20,251
on him back in April,
didn't he?

00:20:20,318 --> 00:20:21,519
(sighs)

00:20:21,585 --> 00:20:22,887
That's it.
I forgot his name.

00:20:22,954 --> 00:20:24,755
Uh, shot coming
home from work.

00:20:24,822 --> 00:20:26,390
LANGSTON:
So you two weren't friends?
No, no, no.

00:20:26,457 --> 00:20:27,725
I never met him.

00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:29,994
See, Coach used to do stuff
like that all the time.

00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:32,263
You know, he'd send me stories
to keep my head straight.

00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,532
I was thinking about
entering the draft, but...

00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:38,536
that guy's death just reminded
me how short life can be.

00:20:38,603 --> 00:20:39,770
So it was a life lesson?

00:20:39,837 --> 00:20:42,173
"Our decisions
define who we are."

00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:43,774
If I were to
die tomorrow,

00:20:43,841 --> 00:20:46,043
would I want to be the
guy who turned his back

00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,511
on his team for
some quick cash

00:20:47,578 --> 00:20:49,380
or the guy who stayed
loyal and led the Mustangs

00:20:49,447 --> 00:20:50,982
to another victory?

00:20:51,048 --> 00:20:52,650
The decision
was easy after that.

00:20:52,717 --> 00:20:53,918
You know what?
Save it.

00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:56,921
Where were you yesterday between
1:00 and 6:00 a.m.?

00:20:56,988 --> 00:20:58,389
I was asleep.

00:20:58,456 --> 00:21:00,891
In my bed.

00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,727
Hey, guys, if you

Hey, that, uh, .38
revolver Sara and I found

00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:52,143
got a hit on IBIS.

00:21:52,209 --> 00:21:55,613
It was used in a six-month-old
unsolved homicide.

00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,415
And get this-- the victim

00:21:57,481 --> 00:21:59,684
died of a single
gunshot wound.

00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,152
The gun had one expended round.

00:22:01,218 --> 00:22:02,486
Yeah, and there's more.

00:22:02,553 --> 00:22:04,088
Bobby Dawson
found fragments

00:22:04,155 --> 00:22:05,222
of tempered auto glass

00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:07,258
on the tip of the bullet
that killed the vic.

00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:09,327
He couldn't explain it.

00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:11,362
I think that the bullet
shattered the passenger window

00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:12,863
and then went
into his chest.

00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,199
He could be our
missing driver.

00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:17,068
Well, and Doc Robbins
found glass fragments

in Paige Hammer's bronchi,
along with a lot of water.

00:22:19,837 --> 00:22:22,607
I think that the gun
was fired underwater.

00:22:22,673 --> 00:22:25,309

00:22:51,402 --> 00:22:53,070
Well, it says here

00:22:53,137 --> 00:22:56,007
that your vic was found
without the shoes, jacket

00:22:56,073 --> 00:22:58,009
or bicycle he left work with.

00:22:58,075 --> 00:23:02,580
Do you even have any evidence
that he was inside the car?

00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:04,515
No, but that
doesn't necessarily mean

00:23:04,582 --> 00:23:06,350
he wasn't the driver.

00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:09,720
All right, just to be safe,
let's go back

00:23:09,787 --> 00:23:12,556
to the lake and canvass the
area where we found the car.

00:23:12,623 --> 00:23:15,526
Okay, but in the meantime,
assuming your theory is correct,

00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:18,629
is it even possible for a bullet
fired underwater through glass

00:23:18,696 --> 00:23:20,698
to actually kill somebody?

00:23:29,707 --> 00:23:31,709
Andrew Jimenez.

00:23:32,743 --> 00:23:34,912
That's just really weird.

00:23:34,979 --> 00:23:36,981
His name popped up
in Coach Miller's homicide.

00:23:38,282 --> 00:23:39,583
Prove your theory.

00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,986
We gotta find out
what the hell's going on here.

00:23:49,351 --> 00:23:51,753
He's Andrew.

00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,422
And this is the car window.

00:23:54,489 --> 00:23:56,424
We fire the gun
through the glass

00:23:56,491 --> 00:23:59,361
and see if it was possible
to shoot him underwater.

00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,620
Firing one!

00:24:31,142 --> 00:24:33,278
Wound has a depth of two inches.

00:24:33,345 --> 00:24:34,679
According to the file,

00:24:34,746 --> 00:24:37,248
Andrew Jimenez had
a shallow penetrating wound

00:24:37,315 --> 00:24:39,617
of approximately
two inches.

00:24:39,684 --> 00:24:42,420
Paige Hammer shot
Andrew Jimenez,

00:24:42,487 --> 00:24:46,157
most likely by accident.

00:24:46,224 --> 00:24:47,459
So we know that Coach Miller

00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:51,296
was murdered the day after
the BMW surfaced.

00:24:51,363 --> 00:24:54,299
But was he murdered
<i>because</i> the BMW surfaced?

00:24:54,366 --> 00:24:55,500
Was there any direct connection

00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:57,636
between Coach Miller
and Andrew Jimenez?

00:24:57,702 --> 00:24:58,937
We haven't been
able to find one.

00:24:59,004 --> 00:25:03,008
Andrew had no ties to WLVU.

00:25:03,074 --> 00:25:05,043
High school dropout,
didn't go to college.

00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,511
Never played sports.

00:25:06,578 --> 00:25:09,781
Could they be indirectly
connected through your

Ah, Paige Hammer.

00:25:11,716 --> 00:25:14,786

no known address.

good-guy reputation.

00:25:21,192 --> 00:25:23,228
According to Andrew's
co-workers, it didn't
fit his rep either.

00:25:23,294 --> 00:25:25,630

of a stretch,

00:25:32,971 --> 00:25:34,639

Coach Miller drove a Beemer

00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,966
Possibly pizza sauce?

00:28:59,644 --> 00:29:01,579
Negative for blood.

00:29:01,646 --> 00:29:03,715
If Andrew Jimenez

wouldn't most of the pizza
sauce have washed off?

00:29:06,751 --> 00:29:09,254
You'd think so.

00:29:09,321 --> 00:29:10,922
His shoes never did
get in the water.

00:29:10,989 --> 00:29:12,657
Because he took them off

Whoever <i>was</i> driving
gets out,

Andrew dives in to save Paige,

00:29:27,973 --> 00:29:30,809
gets shot,
floats to the surface,

00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:33,111
which most likely
freaks the driver out.

00:29:33,178 --> 00:29:37,415
He ditches Andrew's clothes
in the bushes and takes off.

00:29:37,482 --> 00:29:40,318
Right place, wrong time

ATTORNEY: He's not
giving you his DNA.

00:29:45,657 --> 00:29:46,958
Then we'll compel it.

00:29:47,025 --> 00:29:50,261
Look, Calvin, I'm gonna
be straight with you.

00:29:50,328 --> 00:29:52,597
You're in a tight
spot here, man.

00:29:52,664 --> 00:29:54,666
We already found one of your
hairs on the dead girl,

00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:55,934
so we know you
were with her.

00:29:56,001 --> 00:29:58,637
If that's true,
why do you need his DNA?

00:29:58,703 --> 00:30:01,806
We know you were at Pal Arnold's
house on April 15 with her.

00:30:01,873 --> 00:30:03,942
Here, let me show you
a picture of her.

00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:06,478
This is what
she looks like now.

00:30:08,546 --> 00:30:09,981
No, go on, Calvin,
take a look.

00:30:10,048 --> 00:30:11,716
Come on.

00:30:11,783 --> 00:30:14,886
We know you left the party in
Pal's BMW, drove to the lake,

00:30:14,953 --> 00:30:16,254
and then what?
What happened?

00:30:16,321 --> 00:30:18,623
How did the car
get underwater?

00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:19,824
You obviously
saved yourself.

00:30:19,891 --> 00:30:21,326
Were you too much of a
coward to save her, too?

00:30:21,393 --> 00:30:22,327
I mean, that's gotta
be eating you...

00:30:22,394 --> 00:30:23,828
No, that never happened.

00:30:23,895 --> 00:30:26,231
Andrew Jimenez wasn't
a coward, was he?

00:30:26,297 --> 00:30:28,166
He was a Good Samaritan,
trying to help.

00:30:28,233 --> 00:30:30,101
I know you already
told me about him,

00:30:30,168 --> 00:30:31,670
but you weren't
telling me the truth.

00:30:31,736 --> 00:30:34,039
Which brings us
to Coach Miller.

00:30:34,105 --> 00:30:36,141

you and Paige

00:30:36,207 --> 00:30:38,243

your chances to go pro.

00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,744
So you killed him.

00:30:39,811 --> 00:30:41,646
Hmm?

00:30:41,713 --> 00:30:43,148
I got to tell the truth here.

00:30:43,214 --> 00:30:44,683
You need to keep
your mouth shut.

00:30:44,749 --> 00:30:45,850
Come on, Calvin.

00:30:45,917 --> 00:30:49,054
Get this off your chest.

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,590
This is not who I am
and that's not what happened.

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,895
I loved Coach M.

00:30:56,961 --> 00:30:59,664
I'd give my life
for his right now.

00:30:59,731 --> 00:31:01,700
I admit
I was at the party.

00:31:01,766 --> 00:31:02,867
I admit I was with that girl.

00:31:02,934 --> 00:31:04,002
It was a lapse of judgment.

00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:05,337
I did get in the car with her.

00:31:05,403 --> 00:31:08,807
<i>But we never even</i>
<i>left Pal's driveway.</i>

00:31:13,445 --> 00:31:14,612
<i>Coach M showed up.</i>

00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:18,616
<i>He didn't yell,</i>
<i>he didn't scream.</i>

00:31:18,683 --> 00:31:20,885
<i>It'd probably</i>
<i>been easier if he had.</i>

00:31:20,952 --> 00:31:24,222
I'm not angry at you.
But I am disappointed.

00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:27,025
If you want to screw
around with your life,
that's your decision.

00:31:27,092 --> 00:31:31,730
But you cannot do that
and play football for me.

00:31:31,796 --> 00:31:33,932
That goes for the
rest of you, too!

00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:35,433
Now pull up your pants,

00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,470
put down the beers and get
your asses back to campus!

00:31:38,536 --> 00:31:39,638
YOUNG MAN:
Yes, sir.

00:31:39,704 --> 00:31:40,805
Pal...

00:31:40,872 --> 00:31:43,875
you never were
what these boys are.

00:31:43,942 --> 00:31:45,944
And you never will be.

00:31:46,011 --> 00:31:48,046
Stop trying.

00:31:48,113 --> 00:31:50,849
I can tell you that...
it was a lot harder

00:31:50,915 --> 00:31:53,151
than being caught
by my old man, you know?

00:31:53,218 --> 00:31:54,519
I looked up to Coach.

00:31:55,553 --> 00:31:57,756
Then what happened?

00:31:57,822 --> 00:32:00,458
When Coach M tells you
to do something, you do it.

00:32:00,525 --> 00:32:02,827
I went back to campus.

00:32:02,894 --> 00:32:05,497
The next few days
were brutal.

00:32:05,563 --> 00:32:08,299
You know, I had agents
trying to sign me,

00:32:08,366 --> 00:32:10,135
fly me everywhere
for meetings.

00:32:10,201 --> 00:32:12,604
Coach M was giving me
the silent treatment.

00:32:12,671 --> 00:32:16,141
And then I got the e-mail.

00:32:16,207 --> 00:32:17,942
So, this did have
something to do with Paige?

00:32:21,913 --> 00:32:25,583
I didn't know anything
had happened to her.

00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,519
I mean, didn't even connect
the e-mail to her.

00:32:27,585 --> 00:32:28,853
I thought this was about me

00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:32,324
and being at Pal's
lake house and goofing off.

00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,493
So I decided to play for
the Mustangs one last season.

00:32:37,362 --> 00:32:39,297
I swear to you,

00:32:39,364 --> 00:32:41,766
Mr. Stokes, if I'd have
been in that sinking car,

00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:45,170
I'd have done everything I could
to save that girl's life.

00:32:52,975 --> 00:32:54,943
Hey, Ray.

00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,512
You got a second?

00:32:56,578 --> 00:32:58,247
Yeah.

00:32:58,313 --> 00:32:59,882
Did you ever play football?

00:33:00,916 --> 00:33:02,518
Yes, um,

00:33:02,584 --> 00:33:04,353
the <i>real</i> football.

00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:07,022
You know, tok-tok,

00:33:07,089 --> 00:33:08,857
tok-tok-tok,
with your feet.

00:33:08,924 --> 00:33:10,025
Soccer.

00:33:10,092 --> 00:33:11,426
Well, I never
called it that.

00:33:11,493 --> 00:33:13,629
I was born in Seoul,
South Korea,

00:33:13,695 --> 00:33:16,498
and my dad was career
military man.

00:33:16,565 --> 00:33:18,734
I grew up on bases
all over the world,

00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:20,869
and we just always
called it football.

00:33:20,936 --> 00:33:22,271
What about you?

00:33:22,337 --> 00:33:24,106
I'm... I'm from Austin.
I grew up playing football.

00:33:24,173 --> 00:33:26,442
You know,
I feel like

00:33:26,508 --> 00:33:27,643
I understand football players,

00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:30,145
but I don't know
about this Calvin Crook kid.

00:33:30,212 --> 00:33:33,348
At first I thought
he was lying to us,

00:33:33,415 --> 00:33:35,284
but he really came clean
with me, man.

00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,052
And now I'm
not so sure.

00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:39,254
Well, what is the
evidence telling you?

00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:41,223
There's no physical
evidence connecting him

00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,392
to Coach Miller's murder
or to the drowning.

00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:45,527
So where does
that leave us?

00:33:45,594 --> 00:33:48,964
If Calvin's telling the truth,
which I think he is,

00:33:49,031 --> 00:33:50,833
then Paige Hammer
was still alive

00:33:50,899 --> 00:33:53,502
after Calvin and the rest of
the team left Pal's party.

00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:55,737
Pal didn't leave the party.
It was Pal's house, his car.

00:33:55,804 --> 00:33:58,207
He had to be one of the last
people to see her alive.

00:33:58,273 --> 00:34:00,042
Maybe <i>the</i> last.

00:34:00,109 --> 00:34:02,678
And if he was the driver,
Coach Miller knew about it,

00:34:02,744 --> 00:34:05,581
that would be motive
enough for murder.

00:34:05,647 --> 00:34:07,149
Can we put him in the car
with Paige?

00:34:07,216 --> 00:34:09,084
I'll check with Mandy,

00:34:09,151 --> 00:34:10,419
but the gun's the only
evidence outstanding.

00:34:10,486 --> 00:34:11,720
Wait a minute.

00:34:11,787 --> 00:34:14,857
If we want to catch
Coach Miller's killer,

00:34:14,923 --> 00:34:18,160
we gotta find the murder weapon,
right, boss?

00:34:19,228 --> 00:34:24,199
I need...
a couple of volunteers.

00:34:26,235 --> 00:34:27,803
Okay, I'm in.

00:34:31,507 --> 00:34:34,409
He would love to.
Thanks.

00:34:34,476 --> 00:34:37,012
Can I at least hear
what I'm volunteering for,

00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:38,614
considering I've just
been drafted?

00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,717
Campus police always circled
Coach Miller's house.

00:34:41,784 --> 00:34:43,552
They would have noticed
a parked car.

00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:45,220
I'm thinking the killer
approached on foot.

00:34:45,287 --> 00:34:46,755
And since the killer
was most likely associated

00:34:46,822 --> 00:34:48,490
with the university,
that means that

00:34:48,557 --> 00:34:50,793
he would have walked
back to his place on campus...

00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:51,794
Ditching the murder weapon

00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,162
and blood evidence
along the way.

00:34:53,228 --> 00:34:54,730
It's all very
<i>Mission: Impossible.</i>

00:34:54,797 --> 00:34:56,598
What are you talking about?
It's a great theory.

00:34:56,665 --> 00:34:59,101
It's a great theory.
Thank you. Can we go?

00:34:59,168 --> 00:35:00,469
I'm eating.

00:35:00,536 --> 00:35:02,604
There's plenty of food
where we're going.

00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:11,079
You know what this is?

00:35:11,146 --> 00:35:14,683
Looks like a fingerprint.

00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:17,753
Yeah. Yours.

00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,355
Found on your .38 caliber
Smith &amp; Wesson

00:35:20,422 --> 00:35:21,924
in your car
with a dead hooker

00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:24,693
at the bottom
of a lake.

00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,463
Sounds like you're
accusing me of something.

00:35:27,529 --> 00:35:28,931
I'm not accusing

00:35:28,997 --> 00:35:31,533
you of anything.

00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,869
I'm charging your
with vehicular manslaughter

00:35:33,936 --> 00:35:35,637
and negligent homicide.

00:35:35,704 --> 00:35:38,140
Well, why don't you
charge me with

00:35:38,207 --> 00:35:40,843
the JFK assassination
while you're at it?

00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:43,011
No, I'm gonna let you slide
on that one.

00:35:43,078 --> 00:35:44,113
But I could add in

00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:45,681
a first degree murder
of Coach Miller.

00:35:45,747 --> 00:35:47,983
Now that's not funny.

00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,985
I lose my sense of humor
when it comes to murder.

00:35:51,253 --> 00:35:53,055
Tell me about Paige Hammer.

00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:58,694
It was an accident.

00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,296
<i>She was hot.</i>

00:36:01,363 --> 00:36:03,465
<i>The boys had already</i>
<i>had some on my dime.</i>

00:36:03,532 --> 00:36:04,833
<i>My turn.</i>

00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,335
You didn't have
to drive me home.

00:36:06,401 --> 00:36:09,438
Thought you might be interested
in a little... overtime.

00:36:09,505 --> 00:36:11,440
Strictly cash and carry.

00:36:11,507 --> 00:36:13,475
(chuckles)

00:36:13,542 --> 00:36:16,945
(tires squeal)

00:36:17,012 --> 00:36:19,915
Next thing I know, airbag was
exploding in my face.

00:36:22,885 --> 00:36:24,486
PAIGE:
I can't get out!

00:36:24,553 --> 00:36:27,389
<i>I said three hallelujahs</i>
<i>when that window rolled down.</i>

00:36:27,456 --> 00:36:29,658
You can't leave me!

00:36:29,725 --> 00:36:30,692
Let go of me!

00:36:30,759 --> 00:36:33,428
Please! Help!

00:36:35,297 --> 00:36:37,666
"You can always trust
your Pal."

00:36:37,733 --> 00:36:39,168
I'm not a brave man.

00:36:39,234 --> 00:36:41,837
When I was safe, I wouldn't have
gone back for my own mother.

00:36:41,904 --> 00:36:43,472
But that doesn't make me
a bad guy.

00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:44,706
It just makes me human.

00:36:44,773 --> 00:36:47,743
And when that kid showed up,

00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,912
I thought he'd save my ass.

00:36:49,978 --> 00:36:51,680
Hey, you okay?

00:36:51,747 --> 00:36:54,016
There's somebody...
(coughs)

00:36:54,082 --> 00:36:56,084
There's a girl in there.
You gotta help her.

00:36:56,151 --> 00:36:57,619
(Pal coughing)

00:36:59,154 --> 00:37:01,557
(coughing)

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,727
(muffled gunshot)

00:37:07,963 --> 00:37:09,798
<i>Then his body floated up...</i>

00:37:09,865 --> 00:37:11,767
<i>and I got</i>
<i>the hell out of there.</i>

00:37:11,834 --> 00:37:14,369
<i>Tossed his clothes</i>
<i>along the way.</i>

00:37:14,436 --> 00:37:18,774
BRASS:
<i>So this kid dies</i>
<i>saving your girlfriend...</i>

00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:22,611
...and you didn't even call 911?

00:37:22,678 --> 00:37:25,581
I was... I was scared.

00:37:25,647 --> 00:37:27,282
I wasn't thinking.

00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:29,551
You were thinking clear enough
to hide his clothes

00:37:29,618 --> 00:37:32,254
in the bushes,
cover up the evidence.

00:37:32,321 --> 00:37:35,657
It's better to be a live coward
than a dead hero.

00:37:35,724 --> 00:37:36,925
Tell me something.

00:37:36,992 --> 00:37:39,862
How did Coach Miller
fit into this whole deal?

00:37:39,928 --> 00:37:42,297
Just my luck he'd come back.

00:37:42,364 --> 00:37:45,901
<i>I guess he hadn't finished</i>
<i>chewing me out.</i>

00:37:45,968 --> 00:37:47,302
<i>I was soaking wet.</i>

00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:50,539
<i>I had to tell him</i>
<i>what had happened.</i>

00:37:50,606 --> 00:37:54,543
<i>He wanted to call the cops.</i>

00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:59,148
I convinced him of the
consequences for the team:

00:37:59,214 --> 00:38:01,683
the parties, the booze,
the girls.

00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,252
And now two bodies deep-sixed.

00:38:03,318 --> 00:38:05,120
You weren't going down alone.

00:38:05,187 --> 00:38:09,825
You know, it's the only time
he ever compromised his values.

00:38:09,892 --> 00:38:12,594
And even then,
he did it for the team.

00:38:12,661 --> 00:38:16,165
So when that car bubbled up,
so did Coach Miller's conscience

00:38:16,231 --> 00:38:19,301
and he finally figured out
that he better do

00:38:19,368 --> 00:38:22,471
the right thing, but you
couldn't let that happen,

00:38:22,538 --> 00:38:23,839
so you killed him.

00:38:26,975 --> 00:38:28,777
(scoffs)

00:38:36,752 --> 00:38:38,520
Excuse me.

00:38:38,587 --> 00:38:39,822
My name is Ray Langston.

00:38:39,888 --> 00:38:41,490
I'm with the Las Vegas
Crime Lab.

00:38:41,557 --> 00:38:43,692
We're gonna need you
to dump your garbage.

00:39:00,676 --> 00:39:02,511
Really?

00:39:31,273 --> 00:39:33,142
♪ ♪

00:39:38,747 --> 00:39:40,449
(laughs)

00:39:40,516 --> 00:39:42,151
Touchdown!

00:39:42,217 --> 00:39:44,686
SIMMS (sighs):
Nicely done.

00:39:44,753 --> 00:39:48,223
You know, I'm not
a CSI by choice.

00:39:57,065 --> 00:39:59,067
Hey, Hodges?
Yep?

00:40:01,703 --> 00:40:04,406
It's probably
for the best.

00:40:06,074 --> 00:40:07,676
ATTORNEY:
<i>I'm advising my client</i>

00:40:07,743 --> 00:40:08,977
not to say anything.

00:40:09,044 --> 00:40:10,746
Then he can just listen.

00:40:10,813 --> 00:40:16,084
We found your fingerprint in
blood on the murder weapon.

00:40:26,495 --> 00:40:29,198
We also found
your Jupiter Galaxy Ones.

00:40:29,264 --> 00:40:31,366
You told us you had
tossed them months ago.

00:40:31,433 --> 00:40:33,535
In fact, it was just
the other night.

00:40:33,602 --> 00:40:35,938
They matched the bloody
shoe impression we found

00:40:36,004 --> 00:40:37,106
next to Coach Miller's bed.

00:40:37,172 --> 00:40:38,440
You killed Coach Miller, Calvin.

00:40:38,507 --> 00:40:40,476
We're not clear on why,
but it doesn't matter.

00:40:40,542 --> 00:40:42,578
No, it matters
to me.
Calvin...

00:40:42,644 --> 00:40:45,147
Look, you heard the man;
I'm screwed.

00:40:46,102 --> 00:40:51,854
Mr. Langston...
all I've ever known,

00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,858
all I've ever been good at
is playing football.

00:40:55,924 --> 00:40:58,894
I love the game,
and it loved me back.

00:40:58,961 --> 00:41:00,829
And what about Coach Miller?

00:41:00,896 --> 00:41:03,432
Coach M's head
was buried in the past.

00:41:03,499 --> 00:41:04,466
He was naive.

00:41:04,533 --> 00:41:05,834
Nobody's cutting you
a fat check

00:41:05,901 --> 00:41:07,636
for team loyalty.
Not anymore.

00:41:07,703 --> 00:41:11,140
"Calvin, you want to be the guy
who turned his back

00:41:11,206 --> 00:41:13,075
"on his team
for some quick cash,

00:41:13,142 --> 00:41:14,510
"or the man who stayed loyal

00:41:14,576 --> 00:41:18,180
and helped lead the Mustangs
to one last victory?"

00:41:18,247 --> 00:41:20,115
Hell, yeah, I wanted
to get paid to play.

00:41:20,182 --> 00:41:23,819
Are you kidding me? I busted
my ass. I was entitled.

00:41:23,886 --> 00:41:25,320
Then what made you stay?

00:41:25,387 --> 00:41:28,190
That night at Pal's.

00:41:28,257 --> 00:41:29,525
The dead girl.

00:41:29,591 --> 00:41:32,027
I didn't even know she was dead.
She was just a hooker.

00:41:32,094 --> 00:41:34,630
I'd forgotten her name by the
time she stepped out of the car.

00:41:34,696 --> 00:41:38,167
I was drunk,
stoned, whoring.

00:41:38,233 --> 00:41:40,836
Coach M had everything
he needed to bury me.

00:41:40,903 --> 00:41:43,138
So I gave him
what he wanted:

00:41:43,205 --> 00:41:46,108
one last season.

00:41:46,175 --> 00:41:47,509
He was blackmailing you?

00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,612
Yeah, in so many words.

00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:52,281
Then why did you kill him?

00:41:52,347 --> 00:41:55,451
Because he didn't live up
to his end of the bargain.

00:41:55,517 --> 00:41:57,352
He stopped playing me
when it mattered;

00:41:57,419 --> 00:41:59,054
when I had a chance to shine.

00:41:59,121 --> 00:42:00,456
ANNOUNCER:
<i>He's goin' for it!</i>

00:42:00,522 --> 00:42:02,591
<i>Oh!</i>

00:42:02,658 --> 00:42:04,693
Time-out!
Give me a time-out, ref.

00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,696
Coach, let me run
2-22 Strike.
Sit down.

00:42:07,763 --> 00:42:10,332
But the scouts are here.
I need this.
Back off.

00:42:11,366 --> 00:42:12,968
Kayle!

00:42:13,035 --> 00:42:14,403
Run 2-22 Strike.

00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,705
Yes, Coach.
All right, get it.

00:42:19,241 --> 00:42:20,843
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Oh! He got it!</i>

00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:24,580
(cheering)

00:42:24,646 --> 00:42:28,350
CALVIN:
<i>He was punishing me</i>
<i>for letting him down.</i>

00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:31,887
Scouts had stopped calling.

00:42:31,954 --> 00:42:35,524
I could feel my future
slipping away.

00:42:35,591 --> 00:42:38,360
"God didn't put us on
this Earth to be losers."

00:42:38,427 --> 00:42:41,230
Well, he didn't put us here
to be suckers, either,

00:42:41,296 --> 00:42:43,065
so I did what I had to do.

00:42:43,132 --> 00:42:44,767
Did you never stop to think
that maybe

00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:46,902
it wasn't about
you, Calvin?

00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:50,038
Paige Hammer
and Andrew Jimenez died.

00:42:50,105 --> 00:42:52,674
Pal was responsible.
Coach knew about that.

00:42:52,741 --> 00:42:54,076
That had nothing to do with me.

00:42:54,143 --> 00:42:56,578
Didn't it? Carrying a secret
around like that

00:42:56,645 --> 00:42:58,881
couldn't have been easy
for a man like Coach Miller.

00:42:58,947 --> 00:43:02,084
And I think that every time
he looked at you,

00:43:02,151 --> 00:43:04,753
he was reminded
of his own hypocrisy.

00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:12,561
I was looking out for myself,

00:43:12,628 --> 00:43:14,596
doing what was best for me,

00:43:14,663 --> 00:43:16,899
and I'm not gonna apologize
for that.

00:43:16,965 --> 00:43:20,135
But if Coach M were here,
he'd say, "Calvin,

00:43:20,202 --> 00:43:24,106
you need to take responsibility
for your actions."

00:43:24,173 --> 00:43:28,277
So that's what I'm doing.

00:43:28,343 --> 00:43:30,746
I owe him that much.

00:43:30,813 --> 00:43:33,115
Then you did learn something.
