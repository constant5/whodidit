standard operating

TRUCKER:
Hey, I told you I
wasn't drinking,

00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:24,387
but those girls, they must
have been on something.

00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:27,257
What about the pedestrian that was hit?

00:01:27,323 --> 00:01:28,558
Did you see where she came from?

00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:29,559
I didn't see her

00:01:29,626 --> 00:01:31,227
till she was
on the ground.

00:01:31,294 --> 00:01:32,228
Girls were screaming.

00:01:32,295 --> 00:01:33,897
I'm the one
that called 911.

00:01:33,963 --> 00:01:35,632
LANGSTON:
Thank you.

00:01:35,698 --> 00:01:36,900
OFFICER:
All right, calm down.

00:01:36,966 --> 00:01:38,534
Tell me what happened
before you hit that lady.

00:01:38,601 --> 00:01:39,535
WOMAN:
We didn't hit her.

00:01:39,602 --> 00:01:40,670
She hit us.

00:01:40,737 --> 00:01:42,739
Shut up, Claire.

00:01:42,805 --> 00:01:44,474
You girls
been drinking tonight?

00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,009
Is that woman going to die?

00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:47,410
I don't know.

00:01:47,477 --> 00:01:49,012
Which one of you was driving?

00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:50,647
All right, Mitch,

00:01:50,713 --> 00:01:54,017
Breathalyzers and sobriety tests
times three.

00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,752
Got you.
But I'm getting
married this weekend.

00:01:55,818 --> 00:01:56,920
And if he loves you,

00:01:56,986 --> 00:01:58,354
he'll wait.

00:01:58,421 --> 00:02:01,658
Julie was driving.
Julie?

00:02:01,724 --> 00:02:04,861
I'm not going to miss
my wedding for you.

00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,929
(vomits)

00:02:07,997 --> 00:02:10,133
You got a whole desert here.

00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:14,203
LANGSTON:
Hey, Nick, what do you got?

00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,405
Why can't people just wait

00:02:15,471 --> 00:02:17,040
till they get to Vegas
to start partying?

00:02:17,106 --> 00:02:18,208
Is that so difficult?

00:02:18,274 --> 00:02:19,442
Well, it is
for some people.

00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:20,476
You know
what they say--

00:02:20,543 --> 00:02:22,445
beer before wine,
you'll be fine.

00:02:22,512 --> 00:02:24,314
Yeah, wine after
liquor, never sicker.

00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,282
Hmm.
Which is probably
the case here.

00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:28,351
Right front tire is flat
and as you can see,

00:02:28,418 --> 00:02:29,719
this front bumper
is just shredded.

00:02:29,786 --> 00:02:31,521
Yeah, that looks
like the point of impact.

00:02:31,588 --> 00:02:33,256
Paramedic said he found
the victim over there.

00:02:33,323 --> 00:02:35,225
I'm still trying to figure out
what she was doing

00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:38,294
out here all by herself
in the middle of nowhere.

00:02:41,364 --> 00:02:43,666
(monitor beeping)

00:02:49,706 --> 00:02:51,307
We moved her from
critical to stable,

00:02:51,374 --> 00:02:53,977
but it's going to be a while
before you can talk to her.

00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:56,212
Okay, thank you.
Okay.

00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,716
Hey, Jim.
Hey.

00:02:59,782 --> 00:03:00,750
Greg found
an abandoned vehicle

00:03:00,817 --> 00:03:01,818
about a mile
from the scene.

00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:03,152
It could be
the victim's.

00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:05,922
Keys and wallet were under
the seat, Nevada license.

00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:09,459
Her name is
Janet Marie Marsh.

00:03:09,525 --> 00:03:11,160
She lives in
Seven Hills.

00:03:11,227 --> 00:03:13,329
She's a friend.

00:03:15,398 --> 00:03:18,167
About three years ago,
her husband and two kids

00:03:18,234 --> 00:03:20,503
went missing.

00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:24,908
We found his abandoned SUV
with blood inside on the I-15.

00:03:24,974 --> 00:03:28,545
She was hit
near mile marker 41.

00:03:28,611 --> 00:03:30,613
It's the same
stretch of road.

00:03:31,648 --> 00:03:33,683
She lost
her whole family.

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,852
She was looking for them.

00:03:36,886 --> 00:03:39,622
She's looking for ghosts.

00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:18,297
I carried this around
in my wallet for three years.

00:04:18,364 --> 00:04:19,966
This is the husband,

00:04:20,032 --> 00:04:21,367
Mike Marsh,

00:04:21,434 --> 00:04:23,236
and the two kids--
that's Andy, age nine,

00:04:23,302 --> 00:04:25,204
and Emily,
age 15.

00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:27,573
Hmm, how did it
all go down?

00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,910
Well, Janet got out of work
a little after midnight.

00:04:30,977 --> 00:04:33,079
Comes home, nobody's there,
you know.

00:04:33,146 --> 00:04:34,447
So she calls her husband,
she calls her daughter--

00:04:34,514 --> 00:04:35,648
no answer.

00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:38,117
She, uh, calls her brother
who lives nearby.

00:04:38,184 --> 00:04:40,219
He doesn't know anything
about it, so calls the hospital

00:04:40,286 --> 00:04:41,354
and then
she calls us.

00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:42,622
We put out
a broadcast.

00:04:42,688 --> 00:04:44,891
Around 6:00 a.m.,
Highway Patrol found

00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:48,161
an abandoned SUV on I-15 North.

00:04:48,227 --> 00:04:50,897
<i>Inside we find the husband</i>
<i>and the daughter's blood</i>

00:04:50,963 --> 00:04:54,033
<i>in the backseat and a bloody</i>
<i>pajama top of the young boy.</i>

00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,936
<i>Not enough blood</i>
<i>to confirm death,</i>

00:04:57,003 --> 00:04:59,906
but it was certainly enough
to suspect serious injury.

00:04:59,972 --> 00:05:01,841
That's all the evidence
we recovered.

00:05:01,908 --> 00:05:03,509
Case went cold.

00:05:03,576 --> 00:05:05,578
And she just keeps going

00:05:05,645 --> 00:05:06,946
back out to the
crime scene?

00:05:07,013 --> 00:05:08,448
Yeah.

00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:16,355
(camera shutter clicks)

00:05:16,422 --> 00:05:19,025
You know, I usually work
scenes like this solo--

00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:21,260
deserted stretches
of highway,

00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:23,129
nothing around but coyotes.

00:05:23,196 --> 00:05:25,598
I used to consider it
punishment, but now

00:05:25,665 --> 00:05:27,800
I enjoy the quiet.

00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:28,801
(sighs)

00:05:28,868 --> 00:05:30,269
I can leave if you like.

00:05:30,336 --> 00:05:31,938
(both chuckle)

00:05:33,973 --> 00:05:35,975
Looks like the
convertible

00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:37,310
bottomed out here.

00:05:37,377 --> 00:05:39,712
Yeah, this dip
probably caused the car

00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:42,115
to bleed off
a lot of speed.

00:05:42,181 --> 00:05:44,183
It's probably
why the victim is still alive.

00:05:46,986 --> 00:05:48,588
Something in
the bushes.

00:05:56,462 --> 00:05:58,030
I got a flashlight...

00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:02,869
with what appears
to be fresh blood on the grip.

00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,539
Could've belonged to the victim.

00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:07,840
<i>And you didn't have</i>

00:06:07,907 --> 00:06:09,308
any suspects?

00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,610
I kinda liked the brother.

00:06:10,676 --> 00:06:12,011
Name is Bill Cornwell.

00:06:12,078 --> 00:06:13,513
He has
a construction business.

00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:14,947
He was in
partnership

00:06:15,014 --> 00:06:16,215
with Mike Marsh.

00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:18,418
There's a lot of debt,
a lot of insurance.

00:06:18,484 --> 00:06:20,119
That's motive right there, Jim.

00:06:20,186 --> 00:06:22,355
We brought him in,
we interrogated him,
you know?

00:06:22,422 --> 00:06:24,223
He didn't give me a straight
answer. He was very cagey.

00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,259
I just didn't like his face.
I felt he was lying.

00:06:26,325 --> 00:06:28,027
But he had
an airtight alibi.

00:06:28,094 --> 00:06:30,530
DOCTOR:
Captain, she has a concussion.

00:06:30,596 --> 00:06:32,165
Her left ulna's fractured
in two different places.

00:06:32,231 --> 00:06:33,533
There's no
internal bleeding.

00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:35,468
She got lucky. I'm going to keep
her under observation

00:06:35,535 --> 00:06:36,502
for a few more hours.

00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:37,837
That's great news.
Thank you, Doctor.

00:06:37,904 --> 00:06:39,305
Okay.
Thanks for your help.

00:06:39,372 --> 00:06:40,540
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

00:06:40,606 --> 00:06:42,108
Would you mind
if I just...?

00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,810
Give me a minute?
No, please.

00:06:43,876 --> 00:06:46,546
Thanks.
Go ahead.

00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:50,550
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

00:06:51,884 --> 00:06:53,486
I thought we had a deal.

00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,057
No more
moonlight hikes.

00:06:58,124 --> 00:06:59,892
What happened out there?

00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:02,995
How are the girls?

00:07:03,062 --> 00:07:04,330
Did their parents
get notified?

00:07:04,397 --> 00:07:07,533
Come on, Detective.
Don't do my job for me.

00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,768
Okay.

00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:09,836
(knocking on door)

00:07:09,902 --> 00:07:12,638
This is CSI Nick Stokes.

00:07:12,705 --> 00:07:15,341
He's got to do
a little work, okay?

00:07:15,408 --> 00:07:17,877
Mrs. Marsh, I'm here
to, um, document your injuries

00:07:17,944 --> 00:07:19,412
and collect
your clothing, okay?

00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:21,914
Janet, they're gonna
release you

00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:23,015
in about two hours.

00:07:23,082 --> 00:07:24,016
I'm gonna come back

00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,585
and give you
a ride home, okay?

00:07:29,055 --> 00:07:30,156
Ooh!

00:07:30,223 --> 00:07:30,990
(groans)

00:07:31,057 --> 00:07:32,892
How many stitches

00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,926
did they give you?

00:07:33,993 --> 00:07:35,795
You're wasting your time.

00:07:35,862 --> 00:07:37,697
I'm not going to press charges.

00:07:37,764 --> 00:07:39,832
Well, that's up
to the D.A.,

00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:41,334
but I'll put it
in my report.

00:07:41,401 --> 00:07:43,269
Jim told you all about me,
didn't he?

00:07:43,336 --> 00:07:46,706
I can tell by the
look in your eyes

00:07:46,773 --> 00:07:49,876
you pity the poor crazy lady
who lost her family.

00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:51,110
No.

00:07:51,177 --> 00:07:53,079
Yes.
No, I don't.

00:07:53,146 --> 00:07:55,681
Listen,
I don't pity you.

00:07:55,748 --> 00:07:58,584
Honestly,
I completely understand.

00:07:58,651 --> 00:08:00,720
If I lost my whole family
like that,

00:08:00,787 --> 00:08:02,622
I would never stop
looking for them

00:08:02,688 --> 00:08:03,956
until I got some answers.

00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:07,026
No matter what.

00:08:07,093 --> 00:08:11,697
Can you remember anything
about the car accident?

00:08:11,764 --> 00:08:13,266
BOY (low and distant):
<i>Mommy, Mommy, I'm here!</i>

00:08:13,332 --> 00:08:15,935
He was calling me.

00:08:16,002 --> 00:08:17,937
BOY:
Mommy, Mommy,
I'm here!

00:08:18,004 --> 00:08:19,806
Mommy, I'm here!

00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:24,243
(women screaming)

00:08:28,314 --> 00:08:31,084
Sometimes I get lost
in my thoughts.

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,552
Is that what happened
last night?

00:08:32,618 --> 00:08:33,920
You got lost in your thoughts?

00:08:33,986 --> 00:08:38,391
No. I was out following a lead

00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,059
on the case.

00:08:40,126 --> 00:08:42,662
And did you tell Captain Brass
about that lead?

00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:44,897
Uh-uh.

00:08:44,964 --> 00:08:46,833
Because the lead came
from a psychic.

00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:48,101
A reputable one

00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:50,136
who's worked
with the LAPD.

00:08:50,203 --> 00:08:52,805
Jim thinks it's all hocus-pocus.

00:08:52,872 --> 00:08:54,440
You probably do, too.

00:08:54,507 --> 00:08:57,977
(chuckles):
No, ma'am. I've learned
to keep an open mind.

00:08:58,044 --> 00:08:59,145
This job will

00:08:59,212 --> 00:09:01,013
do that to you, you know?

00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,018
This psychic...

00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:09,222
she's sure that Andy is dry,

00:09:09,288 --> 00:09:10,590
yet near water.

00:09:10,656 --> 00:09:12,925
Did you know that
Vegas is built

00:09:12,992 --> 00:09:14,360
on some underground springs?

00:09:14,427 --> 00:09:15,528
Yeah.

00:09:15,595 --> 00:09:16,796
Well, I got a map.

00:09:16,863 --> 00:09:18,965
And there's a spring
in the desert

00:09:19,031 --> 00:09:21,467
right under where they
found Mike's Jeep.

00:09:21,534 --> 00:09:24,270
See-- dry, yet near water.

00:09:24,337 --> 00:09:25,972
Mommy, Mommy, help me.

00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,340
Help me!

00:09:27,407 --> 00:09:28,441
Mommy, please...

00:09:28,508 --> 00:09:29,942
<i>Please help me.</i>

00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:31,978
(voice breaking):
Andy's so close.

00:09:33,112 --> 00:09:35,415
He wants me to find him.

00:09:35,481 --> 00:09:37,650
I feel him
all around me still.

00:09:37,717 --> 00:09:38,885
(sobs)

00:09:41,954 --> 00:09:44,323
What about your husband
and your daughter?

00:09:47,293 --> 00:09:49,362
Never.

00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,764
Isn't that terrible?

00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:52,832
No.

00:09:58,304 --> 00:10:00,506
(computer trilling, beeping)

00:10:23,596 --> 00:10:26,632
(computer trilling, beeping)

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,001
Hey, Greg.

00:10:29,068 --> 00:10:31,304
you gotta come take
a look at this.

00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:34,407
I was just processing

00:10:34,474 --> 00:10:36,442
the fresh blood
from the grip,

00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:38,378
and I noticed old
blood and tissue

00:10:38,444 --> 00:10:39,912
in this ring
around the lens.

00:10:39,979 --> 00:10:41,414
Old blood?
Yeah.

00:10:41,481 --> 00:10:43,883
So it can't be casual transfer
from the vic.

00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,818
Has to be from an earlier event.

00:10:45,885 --> 00:10:47,019
Right.

00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:48,721
And that impact
had to be significant enough

00:10:48,788 --> 00:10:50,123
to actually damage tissue.

00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:53,593
Plus those are hair fragments
right there,

00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:55,027
which tells me that

00:10:55,094 --> 00:10:56,929
somebody was whacked
on the head.

00:11:02,802 --> 00:11:05,972
So, uh, Wendy got a hit
on the blood and tissue

00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:08,274
from Janet Marsh's flashlight.

00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:11,210
Familial match
to her son Andy.

00:11:11,277 --> 00:11:12,678
We could be looking

00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:14,180
at our murder weapon.

00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:16,983
So this woman's been searching
for her son all these years

00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,285
with the exact same flashlight
that was used to kill him?

00:11:19,352 --> 00:11:21,320
If Janet Marsh
was in possession

00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:23,489
of the murder weapon,
that makes her the only suspect.

00:11:23,556 --> 00:11:24,490
Wait a minute now.

00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:26,459
I've met the woman.

00:11:26,526 --> 00:11:28,428
It's very tough to fake grief
like that.

00:11:28,494 --> 00:11:30,663
Well, guilt can masquerade
as grief.

00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,800
And there's a lot of people
who express remorse

00:11:33,866 --> 00:11:35,668
after committing
a homicide.

00:11:35,735 --> 00:11:38,571
If this were the father
that we were talking about

00:11:38,638 --> 00:11:40,306
and not the mother,

00:11:40,373 --> 00:11:43,276
what would we be thinking then?

00:11:43,342 --> 00:11:44,677
"Lock him up"?

00:11:44,744 --> 00:11:46,612
And, ordinarily,
we'd be right,

00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,681
but this is by no means
an ordinary case.

00:11:53,455 --> 00:11:55,457
(knocking on door)

00:11:56,709 --> 00:11:58,478
Hi.
How you feeling,
Janet?

00:11:58,545 --> 00:11:59,479
Better?

00:11:59,546 --> 00:12:00,647
I'm okay.

00:12:00,713 --> 00:12:01,548
Good.

00:12:01,614 --> 00:12:04,017
So, what brings you here?

00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,418
We found
some new evidence.

00:12:05,485 --> 00:12:06,586
It concerns Andy.

00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:07,754
You found my son?

00:12:07,821 --> 00:12:09,155
Uh, no, ma'am,

00:12:09,222 --> 00:12:11,491
but with your help,
we may be able to.

00:12:11,558 --> 00:12:13,626
Okay.

00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:15,428
Come on in.

00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:34,714
So, what can I do?

00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:35,882
How can I help?

00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:37,884
You had a flashlight with you
last night.

00:12:37,951 --> 00:12:38,918
Yes.

00:12:38,985 --> 00:12:39,953
Where did you get that?

00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:41,554
It was in the car.

00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:43,723
Okay, so it's yours.
Yes.

00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,292
Oh. And where do you
keep that, in the car?

00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:47,627
In the kitchen.
How long have

00:12:47,694 --> 00:12:48,695
had the flashlight?

00:12:48,762 --> 00:12:50,163
Uh, ten years.

00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,098
Since we bought the house.

00:12:52,165 --> 00:12:54,400
(chuckles)
Why are they asking
about the flashlight?

00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:57,237
We found Andy's blood on it.

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,775
Well, how can that be?

00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:04,944
You all searched
the house already.

00:13:05,011 --> 00:13:06,446
When we searched
Mike's Jeep,

00:13:06,513 --> 00:13:08,381
that became our
crime scene.

00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:10,617
Mrs. Marsh, we'd
like permission

00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:11,818
to process your house.

00:13:11,885 --> 00:13:13,720
Of course.

00:13:13,787 --> 00:13:15,455
Kitchen's that way.

00:13:18,158 --> 00:13:20,260
MAN (over radio):
Control, 257 Adam, copy.

00:13:20,326 --> 00:13:21,394
Responding at three.

00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:23,730
WOMAN:
252 Boy, Control.

00:13:23,797 --> 00:13:26,366
Respond to a 417
at 273 Adams Street.

00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:28,701
Informant will meet you
in front of the house.

00:13:30,036 --> 00:13:31,237
(scoffs)

00:13:31,304 --> 00:13:34,441
When did you get
the police scanner?

00:13:34,507 --> 00:13:37,644
Oh, I hardly listen
to that thing anymore.

00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,013
It's in the kitchen.

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,615
Yeah. Let-let me show you
where I keep the...

00:13:42,682 --> 00:13:46,119
No, no. You can just point it
out for me, if you don't mind.

00:13:46,186 --> 00:13:49,422
I keep it in the last drawer.

00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,092
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:13:52,158 --> 00:13:54,594
Come on, Janet.
I'll buy you lunch.

00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:01,634
All right, I got a
police report here

00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:03,837
with a supplemental
in Brass' handwriting.

00:14:03,903 --> 00:14:07,107
Time cards substantiate
that Janet Marsh was working

00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:08,842
at Wellington's Market
from 4:00 p.m.

00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:10,977
to midnight the night
her family went missing.

00:14:11,044 --> 00:14:12,545
She had an alibi.

00:14:12,612 --> 00:14:13,580
But she didn't
call 911

00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:16,483
until almost 4:00 a.m.

00:14:16,549 --> 00:14:18,084
Which would've given
Janet Marsh time

00:14:18,151 --> 00:14:20,086
to kill her family,
to clean up,

00:14:20,153 --> 00:14:21,354
to dispose of the bodies

00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:23,690
and to dump
the bloody truck,

00:14:23,757 --> 00:14:25,091
which gave her a diversion

00:14:25,158 --> 00:14:26,960
and took us 23 miles away
from the house.

00:14:27,026 --> 00:14:28,995
That's a lot
for one person to do.

00:14:29,062 --> 00:14:30,597
So, if she did it,

00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:32,332
she had to have help.

00:14:36,302 --> 00:14:38,571
If a stranger committed
these murders,

00:14:38,638 --> 00:14:40,707
he would've brought
his own weapon.

00:14:40,774 --> 00:14:42,075
And if he didn't,

00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:43,143
he would've done

00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:45,145
a quick search
of the room

00:14:45,211 --> 00:14:46,780
and grabbed one
of these knives.

00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:49,282
Why would he pick
a flashlight?

00:14:49,349 --> 00:14:51,851
And why put it back
in the drawer?

00:14:51,918 --> 00:14:54,087
Maybe force of habit.

00:14:54,154 --> 00:14:55,889
Or the killer thought
he cleaned it off

00:14:55,955 --> 00:14:57,390
and put it back
where it belonged.

00:14:57,457 --> 00:14:58,892
Either way, it suggests
we're looking

00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,393
at a family member
or a friend.

00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,997
Janet admitted to Brass
that her marriage was rocky.

00:15:04,063 --> 00:15:06,266
A lot of marriages end
because of infidelity.

00:15:06,332 --> 00:15:07,333
Maybe she was seeing someone.

00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,935
Brass checked
her phone records.

00:15:09,002 --> 00:15:10,503
There was
no unusual calls.

00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,573
Looks like she talked to her
brother at least twice a day.

00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,444
Let's say Janet snapped,
killed her family,

00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,045
calls brother Bill.

00:15:19,112 --> 00:15:20,547
He helps her
cover it up.

00:15:20,613 --> 00:15:23,016
Well, Brass' gut told him
that the brother was involved,

00:15:23,082 --> 00:15:24,784
but the guy had
a ironclad alibi.

00:15:24,851 --> 00:15:27,787
He was questioned
a dozen times.

00:15:27,854 --> 00:15:30,590
Searched his home,
his office, his car.

00:15:30,657 --> 00:15:32,959
Still, Janet told Nick
that she had hallucinations

00:15:33,026 --> 00:15:34,627
about her dead son.

00:15:34,694 --> 00:15:36,296
It sounds like
she was experiencing

00:15:36,362 --> 00:15:37,530
some kind
of dissociative episode.

00:15:37,597 --> 00:15:39,232
Her personality splintered

00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:41,067
because of the guilt.

00:15:41,134 --> 00:15:43,069
This is why she wanders
the highway at night.

00:15:43,136 --> 00:15:45,371
She's being tormented
by her own conscience.

00:15:45,438 --> 00:15:48,408
Or she's a cold-blooded murderer
who's still playing out

00:15:48,475 --> 00:15:51,311
her diversion
to keep the suspicion away.

This is the latest issue
of this magazine.

00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:29,142
Janet Marsh never canceled
her son's subscription.

00:17:29,209 --> 00:17:31,845
You know. it looks
to me like she just quit

00:17:31,911 --> 00:17:33,746
living the night
her family disappeared.

00:17:33,813 --> 00:17:35,582
And she's not going to live
again until

00:17:35,648 --> 00:17:37,684
she gets some answers.

00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,052
What's that?

00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:41,588
Her daughter
had a diary.

00:17:41,654 --> 00:17:43,923
Listen to this.

00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,391
"He gave me
the coolest bracelet today

00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,860
"and told me how special I am.

00:17:46,926 --> 00:17:48,862
"He's the only one
who understands me,

00:17:48,928 --> 00:17:51,831
"especially since my mom
only cares about Andy,

00:17:51,898 --> 00:17:53,566
"and my dad's never home.

00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:55,602
"I love him, and
I wish he could

00:17:55,668 --> 00:17:59,038
take me away from here.
Maybe someday."

00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:02,208
Did Brass interview
the boyfriend?

00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:03,710
Brass never mentioned
a boyfriend.

00:18:03,777 --> 00:18:05,612
Well, this is the last entry,

00:18:05,678 --> 00:18:08,181
five months before
her disappearance.

00:18:08,248 --> 00:18:11,317
She wrote in this journal
every day for a year,

00:18:11,384 --> 00:18:12,919
and then just stopped.

00:18:12,986 --> 00:18:14,654
There must have been something
going on,

00:18:14,721 --> 00:18:16,856
especially at that age.

00:18:16,923 --> 00:18:18,591
Maybe a significant event
with a significant other?

00:18:18,658 --> 00:18:21,428
A boyfriend could've known
his way around the house.

00:18:21,494 --> 00:18:23,229
What's his name?
We'll have Brass round him up.

00:18:23,296 --> 00:18:24,931
She doesn't even mention
his name.

00:18:24,998 --> 00:18:26,199
Not even an initial.

00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:29,002
Ah, that's weird.

00:18:29,068 --> 00:18:31,171
Maybe it was someone
her parents didn't approve of.

00:18:35,074 --> 00:18:37,911
You think they're
dead, don't you?

00:18:37,977 --> 00:18:40,246
It's just that

00:18:40,313 --> 00:18:44,484
I always had this feeling
that somehow Andy got away.

00:18:45,885 --> 00:18:47,287
What about
your daughter?

00:18:47,353 --> 00:18:49,522
Could you ever
give up on Ellie?

00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:51,357
(children giggling)

00:18:54,227 --> 00:18:55,962
Actually, I think
in some ways

00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:57,931
Ellie gave up on me.

00:18:57,997 --> 00:18:58,998
You never stop

00:18:59,065 --> 00:19:00,633
loving your kids.

00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,570
There's a difference
between giving up

00:19:03,636 --> 00:19:05,105
and letting go.

00:19:05,171 --> 00:19:07,140
Janet,

00:19:07,207 --> 00:19:09,843
you got to learn to let go.

00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:15,381
(car door closes)

00:19:17,884 --> 00:19:18,985
Can I help you?

00:19:19,052 --> 00:19:21,955
What's going on here?

00:19:22,021 --> 00:19:23,623
This is a police investigation.
Who are you?

00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,292
Bill Cornwell.
This is my sister's house.

00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:28,828
Let me see some I.D.

00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,697
Okay.

00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:37,871
You're not an organ donor?

00:19:37,937 --> 00:19:40,306
Look, Janet came home
from the hospital this morning.

00:19:40,373 --> 00:19:42,041
She should be resting.
Where is she?

00:19:42,108 --> 00:19:44,511
Your sister's fine,
Mr. Cornwell.

00:19:44,577 --> 00:19:47,947
My sister hasn't been fine
in a long time.

00:19:48,014 --> 00:19:49,649
That's why I have
to come by every day;

00:19:49,716 --> 00:19:51,751
pay her bills,
make sure she eats.

00:19:51,818 --> 00:19:53,653
Is there something going on
with the case?

00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,288
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:55,355 --> 00:19:57,290
I know.
You can't talk about it.

00:19:57,357 --> 00:20:00,026
I just miss them, you know?

00:20:00,093 --> 00:20:01,928
Andy and Emily
were great kids.

00:20:01,995 --> 00:20:04,130
Hey, Bill, while
we're talking,

00:20:04,197 --> 00:20:05,465
have you ever met

00:20:05,532 --> 00:20:07,233
any of Emily's boyfriends?

00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,369
If she did have any,
she didn't bring them home.

00:20:09,436 --> 00:20:10,870
Yeah? Why's that?

00:20:10,937 --> 00:20:12,972
Mike was pretty protective
of his little girl.

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,507
And Em and Janet,
you know,

00:20:14,574 --> 00:20:16,409
they had
a pretty stormy relationship.

00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:19,746
Thanks for stopping by.
Yeah, I hope you

00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:21,080
come up with
something again.

00:20:21,147 --> 00:20:22,348
We'll do the best we can.

00:20:22,415 --> 00:20:23,550
Thanks.

00:20:23,616 --> 00:20:25,685
You're welcome.

00:20:32,158 --> 00:20:33,159
(engine starting)
Hey.

00:20:33,226 --> 00:20:34,494
Hey.

00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:35,995
Janet's brother.

00:20:36,062 --> 00:20:38,031
Heard you could use

00:20:38,098 --> 00:20:39,265
an extra hand.

00:20:39,332 --> 00:20:41,835
Yeah. Yeah, thanks, Ray.

00:20:41,901 --> 00:20:43,336
Greg's finishing up
with the luminol inside,

00:20:43,403 --> 00:20:45,371
but so far, there's no evidence
of any killing

00:20:45,438 --> 00:20:47,373
that took place here.

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,908
Let's check the garage.

00:21:03,757 --> 00:21:05,759
It's frozen in time.

00:21:05,825 --> 00:21:07,060
Just like the rest of the house.

00:21:07,127 --> 00:21:08,461
Let's go to work.

00:21:22,675 --> 00:21:25,945
The luminol's reacting
with the detergent.

00:21:26,012 --> 00:21:28,515
Yeah, and the bleach.

00:21:35,455 --> 00:21:37,090
Nick.

00:21:37,157 --> 00:21:38,725
Hmm?

00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:40,927
I've got something over here,

00:21:40,994 --> 00:21:43,229
and it ain't bleach.

00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,764
No, sir.

00:21:46,633 --> 00:21:48,001
We need to get up there.

00:21:53,206 --> 00:21:55,909
LANGSTON:
That's the stain that seeped
through into the garage.

00:21:55,975 --> 00:21:58,912
A trail of fluid leads
back to...

00:21:58,978 --> 00:22:00,447
this footlocker here.

00:22:00,513 --> 00:22:03,216
U.S. Army standard issue.

00:22:04,517 --> 00:22:09,155
A psychic told Janet that her
son was dry but near water.

00:22:28,007 --> 00:22:29,008
Oh.

00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:42,555
LANGSTON:
Andy was wearing pajamas
the night he disappeared.

00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,458
(sighs)

00:22:45,525 --> 00:22:47,560
BRASS:
Where exactly?

00:22:47,627 --> 00:22:49,829
Have they recovered
anything else?

00:22:49,896 --> 00:22:51,631
Okay, keep me posted, Nick.

00:22:54,467 --> 00:22:55,468
Jim, what is it?

00:22:56,603 --> 00:22:59,873
What? Did they
find something?

00:22:59,939 --> 00:23:02,041
Tell me.

00:23:03,843 --> 00:23:05,812
They found Andy's body.

00:23:07,714 --> 00:23:09,849
At the house?

00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:11,751
No.

00:23:11,818 --> 00:23:14,554
Oh, he was with me all the time!

00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:15,955
(sobbing):
He was with me!

00:23:16,022 --> 00:23:18,458
Come on.
No! No! No!

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,583
(sighs)

00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,585
You know, Doc...

00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:46,222
I'm against the death penalty...

00:23:47,448 --> 00:23:49,917
...except when it comes
to people who kill children.

00:23:49,984 --> 00:23:52,186
I think they should
be tortured first

00:23:52,253 --> 00:23:55,056
and then guillotined.

00:23:55,122 --> 00:23:58,693
ROBBINS:
Every layer of friction ridged
skin was eaten away by bugs,

00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:00,227
so I can't get prints.

00:24:00,294 --> 00:24:01,996
Tissue sample should be able
to confirm

00:24:02,063 --> 00:24:03,531
his identity through DNA.

00:24:03,597 --> 00:24:06,067
Well, I confirmed
the remains as male.

00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:08,135
Femur measured
11 inches.

00:24:08,202 --> 00:24:10,404
That's consistent with an
average nine-year-old.

00:24:10,471 --> 00:24:12,940
The decay was consistent
with a boy

00:24:13,007 --> 00:24:15,109
who's been dead
approximately three years.

00:24:15,176 --> 00:24:16,277
What about C.O.D.?

00:24:16,343 --> 00:24:17,912
Blunt force trauma

00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:19,580
to the temporal bone.

00:24:19,647 --> 00:24:21,716
Single blow?
As far as
I can tell.

00:24:21,782 --> 00:24:23,050
The wound appears compatible

00:24:23,117 --> 00:24:26,520
of an object the size and shape
of that flashlight I saw.

00:24:26,587 --> 00:24:30,324
And there were bone fragments
inside what was left his brain.

00:24:34,095 --> 00:24:36,731
I can't tell you
what Andy was feeling

00:24:36,797 --> 00:24:38,132
in the final moments
of his life...

00:24:39,834 --> 00:24:41,569
...but I do know
he didn't suffer long.

00:24:41,635 --> 00:24:44,305
He shouldn't have suffered
at all.

00:24:44,372 --> 00:24:48,509
(sobbing)

00:24:48,576 --> 00:24:50,044
Her son's body
was found in her garage.

00:24:50,111 --> 00:24:51,645
She was in possession
of the murder weapon.

00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,647
That makes Janet Marsh
suspect number one.

00:24:53,714 --> 00:24:54,882
We're taking her
into custody, Jim.

00:24:54,949 --> 00:24:56,450
The woman has been through hell.

00:24:56,517 --> 00:24:58,586
She just found out
that she's been living

00:24:58,652 --> 00:25:00,287
with her kid's corpse.

00:25:00,354 --> 00:25:02,356
Yeah, a corpse that was
never in her husband's vehicle.

00:25:02,423 --> 00:25:04,592
Which means that her son's
bloody pajama top was
planted there,

00:25:04,658 --> 00:25:06,293
which brings us back
to your friend Janet.

00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,095
She didn't kill her family.

00:25:08,162 --> 00:25:09,864
Jim, I know you're
trying to do your job,

00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,932
but you have a personal
relationship with this woman.

00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:13,300
Okay?

00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:14,769
And that's not going
to look good.

00:25:14,835 --> 00:25:16,604
Don't go there, Conrad, okay?

00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,139
Jim, we're going
to do this by the book.

00:25:18,205 --> 00:25:19,340
I'm not taking you
off the case,

00:25:19,407 --> 00:25:20,508
but I want to interview her.

00:25:20,574 --> 00:25:21,609
She knows me.
She trusts me.

00:25:21,675 --> 00:25:23,310
Let's just see what she'll say

00:25:23,377 --> 00:25:25,179
when she's talking to someone
she doesn't know.

00:25:26,981 --> 00:25:28,949
Mrs. Marsh,
my name's Conrad Ecklie.

00:25:29,016 --> 00:25:30,518
I'm the undersheriff.

00:25:30,584 --> 00:25:32,219
We need to ask you
some questions.

00:25:34,188 --> 00:25:37,358
First, I need to make sure
this waiver of attorney we
have on file still applies.

00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:39,260
Do you waive your right
to have an attorney present?

00:25:40,327 --> 00:25:41,829
Yes or no, please?
Yes.

00:25:41,896 --> 00:25:44,365
I waive my right
to have an attorney present.

00:25:44,432 --> 00:25:47,268
Janet, you remember me, yeah?

00:25:47,334 --> 00:25:49,036
We've talked before.
Yes.

00:25:49,103 --> 00:25:52,173
Guess we'll talk a little bit
again here.

00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:55,743
Um, what can you tell me
about the footlocker

00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:58,279
in the crawl space
above the garage?

00:25:58,345 --> 00:26:01,582
Oh, my God.

00:26:01,649 --> 00:26:03,184
Was he in there?

00:26:05,853 --> 00:26:07,421
Stay with me now, Janet.

00:26:09,423 --> 00:26:10,791
How long has it been there?

00:26:10,858 --> 00:26:14,862
Since Mike got back
from Desert Storm.

00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:16,597
So it was your husband's
footlocker?

00:26:16,664 --> 00:26:19,166
Yes.

00:26:19,233 --> 00:26:21,669
But we kept Andy's camping stuff

00:26:21,736 --> 00:26:23,070
in it.

00:26:23,137 --> 00:26:24,939
He loved to camp.

00:26:30,378 --> 00:26:32,413
STOKES:
<i>And how long has it been</i>

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,081
<i>since you opened it?</i>

00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:37,818
JANET:
<i>We took a camping trip</i>

00:26:37,885 --> 00:26:41,055
<i>to Cathedral Gorge that summer.</i>

00:26:41,122 --> 00:26:43,290
The kids, Mike, Bill and me.

00:26:43,357 --> 00:26:44,792
And Bill is...?

00:26:44,859 --> 00:26:47,028
My brother.

00:26:47,094 --> 00:26:49,530
He spent more time with the kids
than their own father.

00:26:49,597 --> 00:26:53,234
Taught Andy
to fish.

00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:58,072
Uh, Emily was being difficult,

00:26:58,139 --> 00:27:01,809
so I brought her home.

00:27:01,876 --> 00:27:06,347
I'm pretty sure they put the
locker away when they got back.

00:27:15,122 --> 00:27:20,027
You think I killed
my little boy?

00:27:20,094 --> 00:27:22,963
My daughter? My husband?

00:27:25,332 --> 00:27:29,537
I can't move because I'm afraid
if they come back,

00:27:29,603 --> 00:27:32,940
they won't be able to find me.

00:27:33,007 --> 00:27:37,278
I can't sleep, and so I go
looking for them on the highway.

00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:40,247
It's all I do!

00:27:40,314 --> 00:27:43,617
Why can't you people
understand that?

00:27:43,684 --> 00:27:47,922
I hire psychics to help me,
and then people think I'm crazy.

00:27:47,988 --> 00:27:50,624
This is making me crazy!

00:27:50,691 --> 00:27:54,895
And it's got to stop!

00:27:54,962 --> 00:27:57,465
It's got to stop!

00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:03,337
LANGSTON:
I collected 16 prints.

00:28:03,404 --> 00:28:05,573
Six were identifiable.

00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:08,409
Five were on the bottom panel
of the footlocker.

00:28:08,476 --> 00:28:10,945
Position suggests that someone
was trying to pick it up.

00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:14,448
All five were a match
to Mike Marsh.

00:28:14,515 --> 00:28:16,183
Identified by an old work card.

00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,085
Construction contract
at the Eclipse.

00:28:20,021 --> 00:28:21,322
This one...

00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,392
is unknown.

00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:26,560

People on the run

00:33:00,469 --> 00:33:01,904
They're not thinking straight.
They change their names,

Father and daughter

00:33:20,723 --> 00:33:22,625
Connor was three.

00:33:22,691 --> 00:33:25,327
Emily was pregnant
before she disappeared.

00:33:25,394 --> 00:33:27,796
Her father's the father.

I want to see Emily now.

00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:32,368
It's gonna be a while.

00:33:32,434 --> 00:33:33,936
We haven't finished
talking to her yet.

00:33:34,003 --> 00:33:36,238
Why? What's the matter?

00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,473
Emily is safe.

00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,376
So keep that in the front

00:33:40,442 --> 00:33:42,978
But things are
unraveling very quickly,

He's three years old.

00:33:59,895 --> 00:34:04,166
How...? No, no, that can't be.

00:34:04,233 --> 00:34:05,234
How could that be?

00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:06,302
Captain.
Yeah?

00:34:06,368 --> 00:34:08,103
There's a Doug Wilson

00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,639
Wants to talk to you.
Okay.

00:34:10,706 --> 00:34:12,841
I'm gonna send someone
home with you, okay?

As soon as I take
him to Interrogation,

00:34:18,747 --> 00:34:20,850
get her out of here.

00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:22,451
Yeah.

Oh, my...

00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,822

Have you arrested him?
Yes, Captain.

00:34:36,665 --> 00:34:38,334
That's why I'm here.

00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,437
I'm the guy you want,
not my daughter.

00:34:41,503 --> 00:34:43,172
Emily didn't do anything wrong.

00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,107
We're gonna talk about that.

00:34:45,174 --> 00:34:46,775
Let's go.

00:34:46,842 --> 00:34:48,477
I made the decision to run!

00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:49,778
I took her with me.

00:34:49,845 --> 00:34:51,881
Let Emily and her son go!
She didn't have

00:34:51,947 --> 00:34:53,616
anything to do
with Andy's death!

00:34:53,682 --> 00:34:55,317
I killed him!
It was an accident.

00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,318
It was all me.

00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,487
Did you hear
what I said?

00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,955
It was all my fault.

00:35:00,022 --> 00:35:01,257
I killed my son.

00:35:02,191 --> 00:35:03,626
(screams)

00:35:03,692 --> 00:35:05,995
You sick bastard!

00:35:06,061 --> 00:35:07,630
You were supposed

00:35:07,696 --> 00:35:08,964
to protect our children!

00:35:09,632 --> 00:35:10,566
Get down!

00:35:29,451 --> 00:35:30,853
Dad?

00:35:38,794 --> 00:35:39,862

Daddy, what happened?

00:35:50,005 --> 00:35:52,007
What happened?
Daddy.

00:35:52,074 --> 00:35:53,742
No!

00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:56,145
(sighs)

00:36:01,317 --> 00:36:03,352
<i>A man murders his son,</i>

00:36:03,419 --> 00:36:06,355
impregnates his daughter.

00:36:06,422 --> 00:36:07,790
Why turn yourself in?

00:36:07,857 --> 00:36:10,559
I mean, he ran once,
why not run again?

00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,627
Maybe he thought,

00:36:11,694 --> 00:36:13,829
in his own sick,
twisted way,

00:36:13,896 --> 00:36:15,998
that he was really
in love with her.

00:36:16,065 --> 00:36:18,734
And then he found out
that she and their son

00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,169
we're in custody?

00:36:20,236 --> 00:36:22,171
He wanted to protect
the both of them.

00:36:23,272 --> 00:36:25,407
DNA results on Connor Wilson
came back.

00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:28,244
He shares more than 20 alleles
with Emily.

00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,980
Because Connor's mother and
father were father and daughter.

00:36:31,046 --> 00:36:33,916
The extra alleles come
from the maternal DNA.

00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,551
Say again?

00:36:35,618 --> 00:36:39,255
Mike Marsh is not
Connor Wilson's father.

00:36:39,321 --> 00:36:40,923
His father shares
seven alleles

00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,458
with Janet Marsh.

00:36:42,525 --> 00:36:43,893
Janet's brother?

00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:45,427
Uncle Bill.

00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:50,766
I told my mom I didn't want
Uncle Bill to come over anymore.

00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,402
She said I was

00:36:53,469 --> 00:36:56,171
ungrateful,
and it was her house.

00:36:56,238 --> 00:36:59,341
This whole thing is her fault!

00:36:59,408 --> 00:37:01,076
Everything is her fault!

00:37:01,143 --> 00:37:04,647
When did your dad find out?

00:37:07,116 --> 00:37:09,218
That night.

00:37:09,285 --> 00:37:12,354
My dad was still at work.

00:37:12,421 --> 00:37:14,690
Uncle Bill let himself in.

00:37:14,757 --> 00:37:17,760
I thought since I was pregnant,

00:37:17,826 --> 00:37:20,529
he would leave me alone,
but he didn't.

00:37:22,364 --> 00:37:24,967
Andy should've been in bed.

00:37:28,437 --> 00:37:30,206
(Bill speaking indistinctly)

00:37:30,272 --> 00:37:32,408
(Emily sobbing)

00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:53,095
When Uncle Bill left,
I went to find Andy.

00:37:53,162 --> 00:37:55,531
I didn't even know what to say.

00:37:55,598 --> 00:37:57,299
But the way he looked at me...

00:37:57,366 --> 00:37:58,901
He started yelling,

00:37:58,968 --> 00:38:02,104
"I'm gonna tell Mom!
I'm gonna tell Mom!

00:38:02,171 --> 00:38:03,973
I'm gonna tell Mom!"

00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:06,442
She would have blamed me!

00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,445
I just wanted him to shut up!

00:38:09,511 --> 00:38:11,580
I'm gonna tell Mom!
I'm gonna tell Mom!

00:38:11,647 --> 00:38:13,415
Quit it!
You're not gonna tell Mom!

00:38:13,482 --> 00:38:15,050
Yes, I am!
Get that thing

00:38:15,117 --> 00:38:16,352
out of my face!

00:38:16,418 --> 00:38:17,786
You're gonna be
in so much trouble!

00:38:17,853 --> 00:38:19,088
Shut up!

00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:25,794
When my dad came home and found
us, I told him everything.

00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,898
Emmy, what happened?

00:38:28,964 --> 00:38:30,599
(sobbing)

00:38:30,666 --> 00:38:32,301
I'm sorry.

00:38:32,368 --> 00:38:35,771
<i>He said it wasn't my fault,</i>

00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:38,240
<i>that he'd make it all better.</i>

00:38:39,975 --> 00:38:43,546
My dad said we'd come back
someday and bury him.

00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:52,321

00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:08,270
<i>I loved my brother.</i>

00:39:15,044 --> 00:39:16,679
I'm sorry.

00:39:16,745 --> 00:39:18,113
I'm so sorry!

00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,716
(sobbing)

00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:30,259
The D.A. has decided not to file
charges against Emily.

00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:34,129
She'll be a much better mother
than I ever was.

00:39:34,196 --> 00:39:36,098
I never could

00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,167
talk with Emily...

00:39:38,234 --> 00:39:41,637
even when she was little.

00:39:41,704 --> 00:39:43,873
Andy was different.

00:39:43,939 --> 00:39:46,275
He was so easy to love.

00:39:48,744 --> 00:39:50,446
This all happened

00:39:50,512 --> 00:39:53,048
because they knew I could
never forgive her.

00:39:56,819 --> 00:40:01,190
I hope one day
she can learn to forgive me.

00:40:05,594 --> 00:40:07,096
Okay.

00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,266
(sighs)

00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,963
♪ ♪

00:41:09,325 --> 00:41:10,459
Okay, there's your mom.

00:41:10,526 --> 00:41:12,094
It's time to go.

00:41:12,161 --> 00:41:14,396
But before you leave,
how about...

00:41:14,463 --> 00:41:16,799
a green one for the road?

00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,702
All right,
you're a good boy.

00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,537
Go on,
you little CSI.
Mom!

00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,439
Hey.

00:41:23,505 --> 00:41:25,040
Hi.
Mommy.

00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,342
How are you?

00:41:26,408 --> 00:41:27,710
Are you okay?
Yeah.

00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:28,911
Yeah?

00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,714
I missed you.

00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,450
Let me see you.
