(gunshot)

00:07:34,718 --> 00:07:36,987

00:07:37,054 --> 00:07:39,223
the man in the red shirt
was everyone's target.

00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,892
Which is consistent with
everyone's trajectories,

00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,894
assuming he was
a moving target.

00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:47,331
But where are
Red Shirt's bullets?

00:07:47,398 --> 00:07:50,968
Well, all of these shots
are misses.

00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:52,703

00:08:00,811 --> 00:08:04,915
A combination of Dolores'
and Hank's ammo killed Ed.

00:08:04,982 --> 00:08:08,018
And the surgeon pulled
one of Ed's nine mils

00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:09,186
out of Hank's shoulder.

00:08:09,253 --> 00:08:11,288
Well, that answers

00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:14,491
The man in the red
shirt never fired.

00:08:14,558 --> 00:08:16,794
So, all three shooters
missed him

00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,861
and only hit each other?

00:08:17,928 --> 00:08:19,964
Warrick and I worked a case once

00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,866
where two guys were shooting
at each other in an elevator.

00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:24,668
Zero out of 25 were hits.

00:08:24,735 --> 00:08:27,438
But the math is off.

00:08:27,504 --> 00:08:29,974
Customer Ed put four
of his nine mils into Dolores,

00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,442
one into Hank,

00:08:31,508 --> 00:08:33,377
and ten into the back wall here.

00:08:33,444 --> 00:08:34,612
That's 15 shots.

00:08:34,678 --> 00:08:38,949
And we collected
16 nine mil cases.

00:08:39,016 --> 00:08:40,684
So, we're missing a bullet.

00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:43,153
All of Ed's shots missed
in this direction.

00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,688
And unless
it's in Red Shirt,

00:08:44,755 --> 00:08:48,425
it's got to be
in this back wall.

00:08:55,532 --> 00:08:58,068
Got it.
Straight through the wall

00:08:58,135 --> 00:09:00,905
and into the stock room.

00:09:12,182 --> 00:09:15,185
Huh. Ed's nine mil.

00:09:16,754 --> 00:09:19,156
All projectiles
now accounted for,

00:09:19,223 --> 00:09:21,659
which means
Red Shirt wasn't hit.

00:09:21,725 --> 00:09:24,228
It's hard to believe.

and fetch a mint
on the black market.

00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:03,500
Two excellent reasons
for hiding them.

ROBBINS:
<i>Ran her prints.</i>

00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:09,340
Still a Jane Doe.

00:10:09,406 --> 00:10:11,942
Suffered multiple traumatic
events before she died.

00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:14,712
C.O.D. is
no surprise.

00:10:14,778 --> 00:10:17,214
Disarticulation of the
atlantooccipital junction.

00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:19,950
Consistent with her impact
into the rock.

00:10:20,017 --> 00:10:23,621
This, however, is the result
of a separate incident.

00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:25,623
Superficial bullet wound.

00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:27,224
She was shot?

00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,560
Sodium rhodizonate test
was positive for lead.

00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:33,097
The extent of the blood clotting
indicates it was antemortem.

00:10:33,163 --> 00:10:35,666
Shot at least an hour
prior to death.

00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:38,135
So, he shoots her
but doesn't kill her.

00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:40,571
Then dumps her out
of a car an hour later,

00:10:40,638 --> 00:10:41,872
which does kill her.

00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:44,742
Why didn't he
just shoot her again?

00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:47,177
Well, I saw
the crime scene photos.

00:10:47,244 --> 00:10:49,813
It's only luck of the draw
that she hit that rock.

00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,349
Not much logic to it.

00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,752
Gun shop's camera
was out of focus,

00:10:54,818 --> 00:10:56,954
only took intermittent
still shots

00:10:57,021 --> 00:10:59,056
and was on
an oscillating pattern.

00:10:59,123 --> 00:11:02,559
It's hard to choreograph
a less useful record of events.

00:11:02,626 --> 00:11:05,563
However, there were
two helpful frames

00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:08,832
before the camera was
knocked out by a stray shot.

00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:11,769
This one shows
Ed Smith and Red Shirt

00:11:11,835 --> 00:11:13,804
walking into the
store together.

00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:15,973
You can't see
Red Shirt's face.

00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,475
But it does look
like they're together.

00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:20,578
All right.
Now check this out.

00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:24,381

Red Shirt is in front of Mom.

00:11:25,883 --> 00:11:27,918
Not even in Hank's
line of fire.

00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:30,988
STOKES:
He told Brass he was
shooting at Red Shirt.

00:11:31,055 --> 00:11:34,191
Red Shirt is clearly
not Hank's target.

00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:35,993
Which isn't
the only thing Hank lied about.

00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,196
He told Brass that Ed was just
a random, well-armed customer.

00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:41,465
Ed was another
customer all right.

00:11:41,532 --> 00:11:42,633
His prints
were all over

00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,868
the cash
with the full-auto sears.

00:11:44,935 --> 00:11:47,471
Which explains the five grand
we found in his wallet.

00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:49,506
He was there
to purchase more sears.

00:11:49,573 --> 00:11:50,874
From Hank.

00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:54,144
Whose prints were on both
the cash and the sears.

00:11:54,211 --> 00:11:55,312
So, Hank's about
to make another big sale.

00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:58,282
Why shoot such a good customer?

00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:03,320
Get too greedy
for the green stuff,

00:12:03,387 --> 00:12:06,523
you can get yourself hurt.

00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:10,094
We know about your little
side business there, Hank,

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,528
selling the full-auto sears.

00:12:11,595 --> 00:12:13,597
Which is a federal offense
in itself.

00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:16,367
You pile on the fact
that you lied to the cops

00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:17,735
about killing Ed Smith...

00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:19,003
He was robbing us!

00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:21,338
I was... I was afraid
if I told you,

00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:22,840
you'd take a
closer look at him,

00:12:22,907 --> 00:12:24,575
find out about the sears.

00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:28,779
Honestly, I was just
defending our store.

00:12:28,846 --> 00:12:31,215
(Mom arguing)
HANK: <i>I come out of the back,</i>

00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:34,518
<i>and Ed's got my ma at gunpoint.</i>

00:12:34,585 --> 00:12:35,886
<i>And not just him. He brought</i>
<i>some partner with him.</i>

00:12:35,953 --> 00:12:38,255
<i>So I did what</i>
<i>my mother taught me.</i>
Hey! (fires gun)

00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:40,591
Guy kills your mom,

00:12:40,658 --> 00:12:43,727
you're okay saying he died
trying to defend her?

00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:45,462
Make him out to be a hero?

00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:48,232
The truth wasn't going
to bring her back.

00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,735
And I didn't want
to go to jail.

00:12:51,802 --> 00:12:53,270
(sighs)

00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:55,906
So, you caught him, right?

00:12:55,973 --> 00:12:58,309
Ed's wing man, the
guy in the red shirt.

00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,476
You caught him, right?

00:12:59,543 --> 00:13:00,911
That's how you
learned all this?

00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:02,112
Well, actually...

00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:04,481
But we're getting close.

00:13:04,548 --> 00:13:05,683
Oh, God.

00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:07,084
What?

00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:09,620
He's still out there?

00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:14,091
You got to find him.

00:13:14,158 --> 00:13:16,060
That guy, the way he
was just standing there

00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:18,762
with those bullets
flying all around?

00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:20,331
He was not human.

00:13:20,397 --> 00:13:25,469
(shots firing)

00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:27,805
He was like the Terminator.

00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:30,241
A machine.

00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:33,677
<i>I've seen my share of crazies.</i>

00:13:33,744 --> 00:13:35,613
<i>But this guy?</i>

00:13:37,881 --> 00:13:41,852
<i>Wasn't his first time</i>
<i>at the death dance.</i>

00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:46,957
<i>As long as he's out there,</i>
<i>I'm staying right here.</i>

00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,876
(camera shutter clicks)

00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,915
(camera shutter clicks)

00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,054
(camera shutter clicks)

00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,091
Hey.

00:14:11,293 --> 00:14:13,395
Car was parked in
a loading zone off Industrial.

00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:14,596
The ticketing officer

00:14:14,663 --> 00:14:16,631
saw the blood and towed it in.

00:14:16,698 --> 00:14:19,201
I'm hoping it's related
to our body dump.

00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:23,805
R.O. is a Carrie Warren

00:14:23,872 --> 00:14:26,775
of Noelle Lane, Las Vegas.

00:14:26,842 --> 00:14:29,611
WILLOWS:
Is that an I.D. badge?

00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,684
It's our Jane Doe
from the ditch.

00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,720
She was dumped from her own car.

00:14:38,787 --> 00:14:42,390
Clearly, she wasn't driving.

00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:45,794
So, uh...

00:14:45,861 --> 00:14:47,529
what's going on
with you and Vartann?

00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,833
I am a trained observer,
you know.

00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,036
(chuckles)

00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:58,840
Okay. I see it's still in its,
uh, early investigative stages.

00:14:58,907 --> 00:15:00,575
No comment.

00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,046
Huh.

00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:08,483
Same pattern as the quilt
she was wrapped in.

00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:12,320
Key's still in the ignition.

00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:15,290
(key turns, chime sounds)

00:15:15,357 --> 00:15:16,691
Out of gas.

00:15:16,758 --> 00:15:18,894
Explains why the killer
left the murder mobile

00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,228
in plain sight.

00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,130
(removes key from ignition)

00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:25,534
Looks like we have
her house keys.

00:15:35,177 --> 00:15:37,179
LVPD!

00:15:37,245 --> 00:15:39,247
Anybody home?

00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:42,818
WILLOWS:
How's it look?

00:15:44,553 --> 00:15:47,255
No sign of
forced entry.

00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,758
All Carrie Warren.

00:15:51,726 --> 00:15:53,528
Looks like
she lived alone.

00:15:53,595 --> 00:15:55,730
SIDLE:
I got a blood trail.

00:15:55,797 --> 00:15:58,233
It's all clear.

00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,535
You're not going to like
what you find in the bedroom.

00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,705
I'm going to check
the perimeter.

00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:09,744
Blood spatter on the wall.

00:16:09,811 --> 00:16:11,413
This is
where she was shot.

00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,781
(shutter clicks)

00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:15,650
Sheets match the quilt
she was wrapped in.

00:16:22,457 --> 00:16:26,094
There's no photos
of any humans.

00:16:26,161 --> 00:16:28,363
But she sure had some love
for this German Shepard.

00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,732
Yeah. Roscoe.

00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:32,868
Oh, my God.

00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:35,237
It's Roscoe.

00:16:38,773 --> 00:16:40,775
(sighs)

00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:48,617
He was shot.

00:16:48,683 --> 00:16:51,720
Blood trail ends in the garage.

00:16:51,786 --> 00:16:53,955
So, killer's in the bedroom.

00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:55,090
(dog barking)

00:16:55,157 --> 00:16:56,558
<i>Shoots the dog.</i>

00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:57,559
(Carrie screaming)

00:16:57,626 --> 00:16:59,628
<i>Shoots Carrie.</i>

00:17:01,363 --> 00:17:04,065
<i>Takes Carrie and the quilt,</i>

00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:06,301
and takes her car.

00:17:06,368 --> 00:17:10,205
Control, this is 802 Charlie,
Detective Vartann.

00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:11,907
I need Animal Control
to transport

00:17:11,973 --> 00:17:13,208
a dead dog.

00:17:13,275 --> 00:17:14,476
Carrie's tidy.

00:17:14,543 --> 00:17:19,247
Strange that she'd leave
food trash in the bedroom.

00:17:19,314 --> 00:17:21,183
Maybe the killer
likes milk.

00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,652
Stain on the bed skirt.

00:17:23,718 --> 00:17:26,154
Milky vomit.

00:17:26,221 --> 00:17:27,689
I'll get it to DNA.

00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,758
Maybe we'll get lucky
on some epithelials.

00:17:29,825 --> 00:17:33,962
There's no pictures
of any boyfriends,

00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:36,264
yet she's got a drawer full

00:17:36,331 --> 00:17:39,768
of tokens
of someone's affections.

00:17:39,835 --> 00:17:41,903
Hmm. She doesn't want
to look at them anymore,

00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,306
but she can't bring herself
to throw them away.

00:17:44,372 --> 00:17:47,742
Maybe Roscoe wasn't
the only man in her life.

00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:53,682
PHILLIPS:
<i>Backed over by a car.</i>

00:17:53,748 --> 00:17:55,417
Fell down a well.

00:17:55,484 --> 00:17:57,486
Attacked by coyotes.

00:17:57,552 --> 00:17:59,488
Poisoned by a spider.

00:17:59,554 --> 00:18:03,358
Lost in a cave.

00:18:03,425 --> 00:18:07,128
Traded for a Mike Schmidt
rookie baseball card.

00:18:07,195 --> 00:18:08,163
And my favorite,

00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,365
given to a farm.

00:18:10,432 --> 00:18:12,067
Allegedly.

00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:15,837
The tragic fates of the
Phillips family dogs.

00:18:15,904 --> 00:18:17,138
Oh.
Mm-hmm.

00:18:17,205 --> 00:18:18,740
Okay.

00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:20,008
I'm sorry.

00:18:20,075 --> 00:18:23,044
I-I extracted a bullet
from his dorsal lumbar.

00:18:23,111 --> 00:18:25,147
Shallow penetration.

00:18:25,213 --> 00:18:27,249
Lack of vital response
in the surrounding tissue

00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,650
indicates he was
shot postmortem.

00:18:28,717 --> 00:18:31,019
Oh, accounts for the lack
of blood at the scene.

00:18:31,086 --> 00:18:33,221
No blood pressure, no bleeding.

00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:34,356
C.O.D.?

00:18:34,422 --> 00:18:35,924
Undetermined at this point.

00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:38,894
Huh.

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,897
Medium caliber bullet
flattened on two sides.

00:18:41,963 --> 00:18:44,432
Double ricochet explains
the shallow penetration.

00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,668
<i>And the fact</i>
<i>that we have two wounds</i>

00:18:46,735 --> 00:18:49,604
<i>but just one bullet.</i>

00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:53,208
I bought my first
Ruger 1022 from Rinaldi's.

00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:55,577
Oh, sweet.

00:18:55,644 --> 00:18:59,247
Colt Single Action
Army. Beautiful.

00:18:59,314 --> 00:19:01,583
Aw, this baby's a
shooter, not a collector.

00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,918
Dang it.

00:19:02,984 --> 00:19:04,452
Hey, guys.
I know you're slammed.

00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,687
This is the round
that we pulled

00:19:05,754 --> 00:19:08,290
from our female victim's
German Shepherd.

00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,859
You're looking for the
"Truth About Gats and Dogs"?

00:19:10,926 --> 00:19:12,360
(both chuckle)

00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:14,529
A little bit of ballistics
humor there for you.

00:19:14,596 --> 00:19:18,867
See, 7.62 by 25 mil.

00:19:18,934 --> 00:19:21,636
Only a few rare old makes
of gun use this ammo.

00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:23,138
Mauser, Tokarev,

00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:24,573
Norinco.

00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:29,478
Hold on. We collected
a Tokarev from the gun shop.

00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,279
Here it is.

00:19:31,346 --> 00:19:32,614
(casing clatters)

00:19:32,681 --> 00:19:33,782
Whoa.
Whoa.

00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:36,051
The case was stuck
in the chamber.

00:19:36,117 --> 00:19:38,386
You were supposed to clear
that at the scene, Greg.

00:19:38,453 --> 00:19:41,490
I know, but I got it out of
a shattered merchandise case.

00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:44,659
Guns for sale are supposed
to be unloaded by law.

00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:50,432
It's clear.

00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:53,435
Hey, y'all, there's a
piece of somebody in here.

00:19:53,502 --> 00:19:54,970
Must've blocked the
slide with their hand.

00:19:57,038 --> 00:19:58,607
Now, there is no way

00:19:58,673 --> 00:19:59,841
Rinaldi's would sell a gun

00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,276
with an expended case
in the chamber

00:20:01,343 --> 00:20:03,512
and a hunk of skin in the slide.

00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:05,347
Maybe it wasn't for sale.

00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,715
Wait a sec.

00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:09,951
If your vic was shot
with that gun earlier today,

00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:12,621
and it wasn't
for sale at Rinaldi's,

00:20:12,687 --> 00:20:15,924
then it stands to reason that
your killer brought it there.

00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:18,660
There were four players

00:20:18,727 --> 00:20:20,929
in the shootout,
and only three known guns.

00:20:20,996 --> 00:20:24,466
Maybe the Tokarev belongs
to the Man In The Red Shirt.

00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:26,368
Who's the Man In The Red Shirt?

00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:27,869
Some guy on a crime spree.

00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,604
Bobby, can you run
the serial number?

00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:31,940
Then we need to compare
my bullet with your gun.

00:20:36,478 --> 00:20:38,313
(typing)

00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:45,086
R.O. is a John Rakow.

00:20:45,153 --> 00:20:46,321
Guy lives...

00:20:46,388 --> 00:20:49,157
Right behind Carrie Warren.

00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:08,041
Mr. Rakow, I see from your file
you served in the military.

00:21:08,108 --> 00:21:11,478
And you have a Tokarev
automatic registered to you?

00:21:11,545 --> 00:21:14,214
Yeah. I brought
that back from 'Nam.

00:21:14,281 --> 00:21:16,750
That gun saved my ass
more than once.

00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,151
Thank you for your
service, Mr. Rakow.

00:21:18,218 --> 00:21:19,486
You're welcome.

00:21:19,553 --> 00:21:21,588
Where is the Tokarev now?

00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,824
I gave it to a friend.

00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,425
What's the friend's name?

00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,527
It's a neighbor. Why?

00:21:27,594 --> 00:21:28,762
Carrie Warren?

00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:29,997
Yeah.

00:21:30,063 --> 00:21:31,498
You guys get along?

00:21:31,565 --> 00:21:34,434
Well, I ain't
particularly crazy

00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,702
about that
yappy mutt of hers,

00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:36,870
but we worked that out.

00:21:36,937 --> 00:21:39,573
Mr. Rakow, do you
make it a point

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,074
to arm your entire
neighborhood,

00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:42,809
or just the pretty girls?

00:21:42,876 --> 00:21:45,779
I had a daughter once.

00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,815
She was about the age of Carrie.

00:21:48,882 --> 00:21:50,350
She moved to New York.

00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:55,188
Young girl all alone
in the big city.

00:21:55,255 --> 00:22:00,360
I wish somebody had
looked out after her.

00:22:00,427 --> 00:22:03,530
So I look out after Carrie;
I protect her.

00:22:03,597 --> 00:22:05,265
Protect her from what?

00:22:05,332 --> 00:22:08,368
This armpit
of a city.

00:22:08,435 --> 00:22:10,570
You know, when
seconds count,

00:22:10,637 --> 00:22:15,008
you-- you cops
are minutes away.

00:22:15,075 --> 00:22:19,279
So you've got a
crazy-ass boyfriend,
got some screws loose.

00:22:19,346 --> 00:22:20,714
She's always
breaking up with him,

00:22:20,781 --> 00:22:22,316
and he's always begging
to come back.

00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,651
So how do you fit
into all this?

00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:28,221
I chased him off a couple
times, but I couldn't
watch her for 24-7,

00:22:28,288 --> 00:22:31,224
so I gave her the Tokarev
and taught her how to use it.

00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,263
Something happen to Carrie?

00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,865
She's dead.

00:22:45,706 --> 00:22:48,642
Someone shot her and her
yappy mutt with your gun.

00:22:51,311 --> 00:22:53,280
I'm done talking.

00:22:53,347 --> 00:22:55,415
BRASS:
Okay, let's talk about
something else, then.

00:22:55,482 --> 00:22:57,117
What about the boyfriend?

00:22:57,184 --> 00:22:58,385
Has he got a name?

00:22:58,452 --> 00:23:00,821
Dirtbag.

00:23:00,887 --> 00:23:05,058
And I can't recall
his last name.

00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:22,776
The man is wearing

00:23:22,843 --> 00:23:25,245
boots as big
as all of Texas.

00:23:25,312 --> 00:23:27,914
<i>There's no way he could cram</i>
<i>those dogs</i>

00:23:27,981 --> 00:23:31,852
<i>into size-nine sneakers.</i>

00:23:31,918 --> 00:23:34,221
Plus, I observed his hands;
there's no slide bite.

00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:35,822
He didn't shoot Carrie.

00:23:35,889 --> 00:23:37,291
He wasn't in the gun shop.

00:23:37,357 --> 00:23:39,793
He's not the man
in the red shirt.

00:23:40,994 --> 00:23:43,463
ANDREWS:
<i>I got Roscoe's tox panel.</i>

00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,932
Your German Shepherd
was poisoned.

00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:49,102
High concentrations of lorazepam
and diazepam in his blood.

00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:51,271
Found the same
anti-anxiety drugs

00:23:51,338 --> 00:23:53,373
in the milk you collected
from the bedroom.

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,542
So, based on
his stomach contents,

00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:57,144
Carrie's dog drank
the poison milk.

00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,645
What about Carrie's tox?

00:23:58,712 --> 00:24:00,681
She was clean.
Stomach was empty.

00:24:00,747 --> 00:24:03,083
No milk.
We didn't find any
prescriptions at Carrie's house.

00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,252
Red Shirt had to have
brought the drugs with him.

00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:09,990
So he dissolved them in milk
and feeds them to the dog?

00:24:13,894 --> 00:24:16,263
The dog apparently regurgitated
some of the mixture

00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,132
onto the bedskirt, but not
enough to save his life.

00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:22,436
The killer premeditates
the dog's murder,
but not Carrie's?

00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,471
Not necessarily.

00:24:24,538 --> 00:24:26,506
He poisons the dog
to shut it up.

00:24:26,573 --> 00:24:27,808
Waits for her to come home,

00:24:27,874 --> 00:24:29,710
then shoots her
with her own gun.

00:24:29,776 --> 00:24:32,546
Well, if that's true,
he knew her. He knew her dog.

00:24:32,613 --> 00:24:34,214
He knew where she kept the gun.

00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:36,617
No signs of forced entry.

00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,385
He had to have a key.

00:24:38,452 --> 00:24:41,288
Obvious question--
she have a boyfriend?

00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:42,856
Oh, yeah.

00:24:42,923 --> 00:24:45,592
And I'm betting
he has a red shirt.

00:24:46,994 --> 00:24:50,163
I mean, is this what
women really want?

00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:54,034
It's what men think
women want.

00:24:54,101 --> 00:24:56,036
Like candy.

00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:57,838
It's sweet and hard to resist,

00:24:57,904 --> 00:25:01,308
but sooner or later, we just
want some meat and potatoes.

00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,311
(gravelly voice):
All the women I take out
just order a salad.

00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:08,982
(laughs)
God, I used to have drawers
full of this crap from guys.

00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:15,222
Now I just want a man
I can count on.

00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:17,924
"My eternal love is yours

00:25:17,991 --> 00:25:20,527
in life and in death.
Forever, Sam."

00:25:20,594 --> 00:25:23,497
That sure sounds
like a boyfriend.

00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,499
Although I never wrote
a love poem

00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,634
to a girl that included
the word "death."

00:25:29,002 --> 00:25:30,604
There's something
under that label.

00:25:41,348 --> 00:25:45,118
Sam gift-lifted this book
from a public library

00:25:45,185 --> 00:25:46,853
and gave it
to his beloved.

00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,355
Classy.

00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:51,992
Call the library and find out
who the last borrower was.

00:26:21,989 --> 00:26:25,325
♪ ♪

00:26:38,872 --> 00:26:41,341
(knocking)

00:26:48,949 --> 00:26:51,184
Las Vegas Police.
Anybody home?

(football game playing on TV)

00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:55,789
Go, go, go, go, go.
Hold.

00:26:55,856 --> 00:26:56,990
Who are you?

00:26:57,057 --> 00:26:58,158
I'm Detective Jim Brass,

00:26:58,225 --> 00:26:59,426
Las Vegas Police.

00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:00,827
We're looking for Sam Trent.
Who are you?

00:27:00,894 --> 00:27:03,964
I'm Paul Trent, his father.
He's not home.

00:27:04,031 --> 00:27:06,266
What happened
here, Mr. Trent?

00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:09,069
It was an accident.

00:27:09,136 --> 00:27:11,071
BRASS:
Any idea where Sam is?

00:27:11,138 --> 00:27:14,474
My son's 27. I don't interfere
with his personal life.

00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:16,610
Well, we do. We have a warrant
to search your house.

00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:17,978
What's this about?

00:27:18,045 --> 00:27:19,780
An overdue library book.

00:27:21,381 --> 00:27:23,717
Mr. Trent, I need you
to come with me.

00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:32,292
Another accident.
Mm-hmm.

00:27:42,102 --> 00:27:44,371
SIDLE:
Styron, Plath, Sexton.

00:27:44,438 --> 00:27:46,607
Looks like a reading
list from Morbid 101.

00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:51,678
Taste in cinema appears
to be much lighter.

00:27:51,745 --> 00:27:54,381
These are all
romantic comedies.

00:27:54,448 --> 00:27:56,483
SIDLE: With the kind of guy
who never gives up

00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,518
until he wins the heart
of his dream girl?

00:27:58,585 --> 00:28:01,221
Of course, Sam's dream girl
is dead.

00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:10,030
A photograph

00:28:10,097 --> 00:28:11,832
of Sam and Carrie.

00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,734
Proves they
were together.
Mm-hmm.

00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,704
Does this look like
it was taken from the
top of the Stratosphere to you?

00:28:17,771 --> 00:28:20,007
No, it's not
high enough.

00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,943
It's got to be
the Ivory Tower Skydeck.

00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,879
It's kind of a dumpy
old tourist trap
with a nice view

00:28:25,946 --> 00:28:27,848
of the methadone clinic
across the street.

00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,449
I'll take you there sometime.

00:28:29,516 --> 00:28:32,119
Gee, thanks.

00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,222
I have...

00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:39,926
at least a dozen ticket stubs

00:28:39,993 --> 00:28:43,063
to the Skydeck.

00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:46,733
Maybe it was Sam and Carrie's
favorite place.

00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,101
Eight bucks a pop.

00:28:48,168 --> 00:28:50,470
What do you have?

00:28:50,537 --> 00:28:53,140
Letters.

00:28:53,206 --> 00:28:55,776
"Sam, meeting
you up there,

00:28:55,842 --> 00:28:58,745
the city sprawling
below us, changed my life."

00:28:58,812 --> 00:29:00,981
This is five days later.

00:29:01,048 --> 00:29:04,618
"Sam, I'm sorry, but I can't
be with you anymore."

00:29:04,685 --> 00:29:06,520
And then a few days after that.

00:29:06,586 --> 00:29:08,588
"I can't stop thinking
about you."

00:29:08,655 --> 00:29:10,090
"I need you.

00:29:10,157 --> 00:29:12,259
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me."

00:29:12,326 --> 00:29:14,227
"Sam, I hope we can
always be friends."

00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:17,097
Light-switch romance.

00:29:17,164 --> 00:29:19,299
On and off.

00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:21,501
Well, this is from last week.

00:29:21,568 --> 00:29:23,670
"You need to respect
my boundaries, Sam.

00:29:23,737 --> 00:29:27,140
It's over. Leave me alone, or my
neighbor will kick your ass."

00:29:27,207 --> 00:29:29,142
Good neighbor John Rakow?

00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:38,018
Diazepam.

00:29:38,085 --> 00:29:40,420
Lorazepam.

00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,190
Both scripts written last week.

00:29:43,256 --> 00:29:45,158
Both empty.

00:29:45,225 --> 00:29:46,927
That's what killed Carrie's dog.

00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,195
Mm.

00:29:49,196 --> 00:29:54,868
Some other...
letters here.

00:29:54,935 --> 00:29:58,305
This one...

00:29:58,372 --> 00:30:00,207
written two days ago.

00:30:00,274 --> 00:30:01,341
From Sam to Carrie.

00:30:01,408 --> 00:30:03,277
Looks like
an early draft.

00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,545
"Carrie, we have
talked about this.

00:30:05,612 --> 00:30:09,283
"I know talking is easier
than going through with it.

00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,452
"But after the darkness
comes the light.

00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:18,659
"In a painless moment we
can be together forever."

00:30:18,725 --> 00:30:23,063
That sounds like an invitation
to a suicide pact.

00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:26,400
She's dead.

00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:29,136
Did he change his mind?

00:30:37,873 --> 00:30:40,309
You have the results from
the Carrie Warren scene?
I do.

00:30:40,376 --> 00:30:43,145
There was DNA on the lip
of the tainted milk bottle.

00:30:43,212 --> 00:30:45,648
And I just matched it
to Sam Trent's toothbrush

00:30:45,714 --> 00:30:47,816
that was sent over
from his house.

00:30:47,883 --> 00:30:49,918
Sam drank the
poisoned milk?
Yeah.

00:30:49,985 --> 00:30:51,487
Which is why
I then ran the vomit,

00:30:51,553 --> 00:30:53,722
and it turns out it wasn't
actually the dog's.

00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:55,524
The mucosal cells
were a match to Sam.

00:30:55,591 --> 00:30:59,094
Sam tried to commit suicide
in Carrie's bedroom but failed?
Mm-hmm.

00:30:59,161 --> 00:31:01,930
(sighs)
What about the tissue
from the gun?

00:31:01,997 --> 00:31:04,099
(machine beeps)
Just came up.

00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:14,076
It's Carrie Warren.

00:31:14,143 --> 00:31:16,478
You're joking.

00:31:17,746 --> 00:31:20,549
She shot herself?

00:31:46,973 --> 00:31:48,241
The physical evidence

00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:51,244
now supports
the suicide pact theory.

00:31:51,311 --> 00:31:53,346
Only Sam didn't die
from the poison,

00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:55,682
and Carrie didn't die
from the gunshot.

00:31:55,749 --> 00:31:57,083
Okay, check this out.

00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,686
This is Carrie's house.

00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:01,821
This is where we
found the body.

00:32:01,888 --> 00:32:05,125
This is where you found her car.

00:32:05,191 --> 00:32:06,826
And this is Rinaldi's
Gun &amp; Ammo.

00:32:06,893 --> 00:32:09,095
I think that Sam took
the gun and Carrie,

00:32:09,162 --> 00:32:12,165
got in her car, and I think he
was headed for the gun shop.

00:32:12,232 --> 00:32:13,700
The gun was jammed.

00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:18,071
It wasn't his gun, so maybe
he thought it ran out of ammo.

00:32:18,138 --> 00:32:21,308
He needed more bullets, so he
could finish them both off.

00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:24,044
Okay, so why did he dump her
on the side of the road

00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,645
on the way to the gun shop?

00:32:25,712 --> 00:32:31,451
Well, Carrie was dumped
at the apex of a hairpin turn.

00:32:31,518 --> 00:32:32,852
And a piece of the quilt

00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:34,754
was in the passenger
door latch,

00:32:34,821 --> 00:32:38,325
which could have prevented
the door from fully closing.

00:32:41,094 --> 00:32:42,429
(tires screeching)

00:32:43,997 --> 00:32:45,832
I mean, an accident
would explain

00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:47,767
why he wrapped her in a quilt.

00:33:12,642 --> 00:33:14,877
Nothing was going
according to plan.

00:33:14,944 --> 00:33:16,012
She's dead,
he's not.

00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:19,282
He's probably feeling
left behind.

00:33:19,348 --> 00:33:21,117
Yeah, and now
he really needs

00:33:21,184 --> 00:33:22,752
to get to that gun shop.

00:33:22,818 --> 00:33:24,153
So when the car runs
out of gas,

00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,621
he just walks
the rest of the way.

00:33:25,688 --> 00:33:28,457
Suicidal guy enters
a gun shop,

00:33:28,524 --> 00:33:31,127
desperate for another bullet
to pop into his Tokarev.

00:33:31,194 --> 00:33:33,563
If they're not going
to give one to him,

00:33:33,629 --> 00:33:35,164
maybe they'll shoot one at him.

00:33:35,231 --> 00:33:39,735
Mm. So somehow,
Sam triggered the gunfight.

00:33:39,802 --> 00:33:41,437
Just his luck, he's the only one

00:33:41,504 --> 00:33:43,506
that walks out of there
unscathed.

00:33:48,144 --> 00:33:49,478
(door rattling)

00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:56,185
Sara...

00:33:56,252 --> 00:33:58,454
the closet door's
been kicked in.

00:33:58,521 --> 00:34:01,123
I don't think
Sam did this.

00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:05,461
Does that look
like a cowboy boot to you?

00:34:05,528 --> 00:34:07,330
Texas-sized.

00:34:07,396 --> 00:34:10,800
Mr. Trent, if you want
to try to help us

00:34:10,867 --> 00:34:12,034
save your son's life,

00:34:12,101 --> 00:34:14,704
you've got to tell me
what happened in your house.

00:34:19,342 --> 00:34:22,745
There was a knock at the door.

00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:25,214
I barely heard it over the TV.

00:34:25,281 --> 00:34:27,517
When I went to answer it...

00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:29,685
(football game playing on TV)

00:34:29,752 --> 00:34:30,753
(door banging)

00:34:31,921 --> 00:34:33,489
(glass shattering)

00:34:33,556 --> 00:34:36,659
Sam Trent, where is he?
Where is he?!
(gun cocks)

00:34:40,229 --> 00:34:42,298
Sam, you son of a bitch!

00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,801
When he didn't find Sam,

00:34:45,868 --> 00:34:47,570
he trashed the place
and stormed out.

00:34:47,637 --> 00:34:50,006
A couple minutes later,
Sammy came home.

00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:56,212
Sammy... Sammy,

00:34:56,279 --> 00:34:57,580
what happened?

00:34:57,647 --> 00:34:59,582
Are you in trouble?

00:34:59,649 --> 00:35:01,017
There was a man here.

00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:02,585
I... I almost called the police.

00:35:02,652 --> 00:35:04,020
No police, Dad.

00:35:04,086 --> 00:35:06,522
Everything's gonna be fine.

00:35:06,589 --> 00:35:09,659
Take my car.
The guy had a gun.

00:35:09,725 --> 00:35:12,328
Go on, t-take my keys,
grab-grab my wallet.

00:35:12,395 --> 00:35:14,997
Take what you need.

00:35:15,064 --> 00:35:16,299
Thanks, Dad.

00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:25,107
Sam only wanted eight dollars
from his father?

00:35:25,174 --> 00:35:28,778
The price of an Ivory Tower
Skydeck ticket.

00:35:37,386 --> 00:35:39,388
Hey, you-you
can't park here.

00:35:46,429 --> 00:35:48,531
I just received
Carrie Warren's
medical records.

00:35:48,598 --> 00:35:50,266
She had a history
of bipolar disorder

00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:51,934
for which she was
recently was being

00:35:52,001 --> 00:35:54,070
treated at
St. Anthony's Hospital,

00:35:54,136 --> 00:35:58,007
101 Southwest
Harmony Avenue.

00:35:58,074 --> 00:36:00,409
101 S.W.

00:36:00,476 --> 00:36:03,446
The shopping list
from the gun shop.
Yeah.

00:36:03,513 --> 00:36:04,947
It was an address.

00:36:05,014 --> 00:36:06,148
Uh-huh.
We just assumed

00:36:06,215 --> 00:36:09,886
that he was driving
Carrie to the gun shop.

00:36:09,952 --> 00:36:11,754
This is her house...

00:36:11,821 --> 00:36:13,923
body, car.

00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,391
There's the gun shop.

00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:17,894
And just to the west
of it...

00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,730
St. Anthony's.

00:36:20,796 --> 00:36:23,799
He was headed for the hospital.

00:36:23,866 --> 00:36:25,968
Sam was trying to save her life.

00:36:45,087 --> 00:36:47,423
(lively chatter)

00:36:54,764 --> 00:36:57,633
(wind whistling)

00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,702
(vehicles passing below)

00:37:11,447 --> 00:37:13,449
(distant car alarm blaring)

00:37:22,191 --> 00:37:25,027
(sirens wailing)

00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,497
(siren whoops)

00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:33,736
Control, officers are moving
into position

00:37:33,803 --> 00:37:36,839
(cell phone rings)
at the Ivory Tower.

00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:39,141
I need a full rescue-
team response.

00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:40,977
Detective Vartann and a police
officer are already up there.

00:37:41,043 --> 00:37:42,378
You're free to go up.

00:37:42,445 --> 00:37:44,614
I don't want any
heroes up there.

00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,883
Can you hear me, Catherine?

00:37:55,224 --> 00:37:56,692
You son of a bitch!

00:37:56,759 --> 00:37:58,828
You're a dead man, Sam Trent!
(grunts)

00:37:58,895 --> 00:38:01,597
(gasping):
One would think.

00:38:01,664 --> 00:38:02,598
(gun cocks)

00:38:02,665 --> 00:38:04,367
Police, drop the weapon!
Drop it!

00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:06,536
John, Sam didn't
shoot Carrie.

00:38:06,602 --> 00:38:07,570
You're lying!
We found her skin

00:38:07,637 --> 00:38:09,171
in the Tokarev slide.
John, you know

00:38:09,238 --> 00:38:11,073
what that means?
I know you do.

00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,108
Carrie shot herself.
No, you're lying.

00:38:12,174 --> 00:38:13,509
She wouldn't do that.

00:38:13,576 --> 00:38:15,211
John, Carrie was bipolar.

00:38:15,278 --> 00:38:17,513
She'd attempted
suicide before.

00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,148
You told me that
Carrie needed protection,

00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:20,783
but it wasn't from Sam,

00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:21,817
it was from herself.

00:38:21,884 --> 00:38:23,052
That's not true,
John. I killed her.

00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,720
You shut up!

00:38:24,787 --> 00:38:26,522
I put the gun to her head.

00:38:26,589 --> 00:38:28,191
I brushed away...
LANGSTON:
Sam stop.

00:38:28,257 --> 00:38:30,760
I brushed away her hair,
I looked into her eyes...

00:38:30,826 --> 00:38:31,794
and I just...

00:38:31,861 --> 00:38:33,796
LANGSTON:
John, after Carrie

00:38:33,863 --> 00:38:35,198
shot herself, Sam took her
to the hospital.

00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,767
No, that's not true!
I killed her, John.

00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:39,302
We found a note

00:38:39,368 --> 00:38:41,437
with the address
to St. Anthony's on it.

00:38:41,504 --> 00:38:44,807
SARA:
Sam, you loved Carrie.

00:38:44,874 --> 00:38:47,210
You tried
to save her.

00:38:52,014 --> 00:38:53,082
(uncocks gun)

00:38:55,184 --> 00:38:56,586
Sam!

00:38:56,652 --> 00:38:58,221
You don't have to die today!

00:38:58,287 --> 00:39:00,389
This is meant to be.

00:39:00,456 --> 00:39:01,791
You don't have to die today.

00:39:01,858 --> 00:39:05,328
The last two people who tried
to stop me ended up dead.

00:39:05,394 --> 00:39:07,230
Just give me one bullet, okay?

00:39:07,296 --> 00:39:09,298
Just one bullet.
Whatever this takes!

00:39:09,365 --> 00:39:10,233
(laughs)

00:39:10,299 --> 00:39:12,335
Just give me one bullet!
No...

00:39:12,401 --> 00:39:14,604
(gunshots)
Hey!

00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:18,708
This is where Carrie and I met.

00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:21,010
And this is where it's
destined to end.

00:39:21,077 --> 00:39:22,311
It doesn't have
to end here.

00:39:22,378 --> 00:39:24,146
We know about the pact.

00:39:25,748 --> 00:39:27,316
We know you tried to save her.

00:39:27,383 --> 00:39:28,851
And Carrie,

00:39:28,918 --> 00:39:31,654
she would want us to save you.

00:39:34,323 --> 00:39:36,125
Okay, but I have
one question.

00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:39,795
Was it me or the dog?

00:39:39,862 --> 00:39:42,465
What do you mean?

00:39:42,532 --> 00:39:47,970
It wasn't, I mean, it wasn't
technically a pact.

00:39:50,706 --> 00:39:53,342
<i>I wanted her to come home</i>
<i>and find me.</i>

00:39:53,409 --> 00:39:58,814
<i>My whole being</i>
<i>rendered solemn valentine.</i>

00:39:58,881 --> 00:40:00,683
(dog whining)

00:40:04,687 --> 00:40:06,822
(gunshot)

00:40:13,029 --> 00:40:15,331
<i>There was milk all over</i>
<i>its snout.</i>

00:40:26,242 --> 00:40:28,778
<i>Carrie loved that dog.</i>

00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:32,415
<i>And when she came home</i>
<i>and found him,</i>

00:40:32,481 --> 00:40:35,785
was it the sight of me
or the dog

00:40:35,852 --> 00:40:37,820
that made her pull the trigger?

00:40:37,887 --> 00:40:39,789
It was you, Sam.

00:40:39,856 --> 00:40:41,524
I'm sure it was you.

00:40:41,591 --> 00:40:44,927
So nice of you to say that.

00:40:45,962 --> 00:40:47,129
SIDLE:
Sam!

00:41:11,754 --> 00:41:13,923
(sirens wailing)

00:41:21,464 --> 00:41:23,199
Situation is Code Four.

00:41:23,266 --> 00:41:24,634
One in custody.
