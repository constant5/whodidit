Another quiet night

00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:18,642
Nothing stirring

Nobody should be out here.

00:01:48,698 --> 00:01:51,334
That's Juan Ramirez,

CAVALIERE:
He was dumping trash,
which is what

00:01:57,474 --> 00:01:59,376
you guys are here for.

(indistinct background

00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,461
Surgical waste?!

00:02:32,642 --> 00:02:34,110
And human organs.

00:02:34,177 --> 00:02:36,046

00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:38,048

00:02:39,249 --> 00:02:40,750
And these cuts--

00:02:40,817 --> 00:02:42,452
they're surgically precise.

00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:45,622
Hey, guys, we need a tarp
on the ground over here, please.

00:02:51,261 --> 00:02:53,396
Nick.

00:02:57,734 --> 00:02:59,736
It's just a kid.

00:03:01,705 --> 00:03:03,139
Betadine.

00:03:03,206 --> 00:03:04,741
This boy was prepped
for surgery.

00:03:04,808 --> 00:03:06,710
What are the chances
there's another guy in Vegas

00:03:06,776 --> 00:03:08,745
cutting out human organs
on the DL?

00:03:08,812 --> 00:03:10,313
No, this is Dr. Jekyll's work.

00:03:11,648 --> 00:03:14,417
I never would've expected
him to look like Juan.

00:03:14,484 --> 00:03:15,819
Nah.

00:03:15,886 --> 00:03:17,787
That's not him.

00:03:17,854 --> 00:03:20,423
Hey, Dr. Frankenstein had Igor.

00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,159
Maybe Dr. Jekyll has Juan.

Room service found her
just after 4:00 a.m.

There's no cameras
in the hallway,

00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:07,449

What about the stairs?

Well, hotel
security tells me

00:04:11,186 --> 00:04:12,921
that the door
monitoring system

00:04:12,988 --> 00:04:15,124
hasn't been triggered
in the last 12 hours.

00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,792
David.

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:17,860
What have you got?

00:04:17,926 --> 00:04:19,294
White marks on the neck,

00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:20,496
but they don't go
all the way around,

00:04:20,562 --> 00:04:23,032
and there's no indentations
on the skin.

00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:25,000
Means she probably
wasn't strangled.

00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:27,369
Possible asphyxiation.
Possible.

00:04:28,404 --> 00:04:30,539
We have no abrasions
on her legs.

00:04:32,675 --> 00:04:34,376
Nothing on her back.

00:04:34,443 --> 00:04:36,178
She must have been dead when
the killer dragged her out here.

00:04:36,245 --> 00:04:38,614
BRASS: Which means
she was probably killed

00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:39,882
in a room on this floor.

00:04:39,948 --> 00:04:41,684
Here's her purse.

00:04:43,452 --> 00:04:44,553
Smooth skin.

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,456
Very little body hair.

00:04:47,523 --> 00:04:49,191
Makes her a perfect
candidate for Super Glue.

00:04:49,258 --> 00:04:51,460
Call Robbins, have him turn
the thermostat down in autopsy.

00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:53,328
And, David,
get the body back stat.

00:04:53,395 --> 00:04:54,897
Disturb her as little
as possible.

00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:57,299
I'll leave
her clothes on.

00:04:57,366 --> 00:04:58,467

00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:02,304
23 from Phoenix.

00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:04,373
Yeah, hi, this is Captain Brass.
I'm upstairs.

00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,342
Do you have a Karen Jones

00:05:06,408 --> 00:05:08,310
registered as
a hotel guest?

00:05:08,377 --> 00:05:09,878
MAN: No, sir,we don't.
Thank you.

00:05:09,945 --> 00:05:11,347
She's not registered.

00:05:13,782 --> 00:05:16,418
This might be.

00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:42,611
I found some empty bottles
of prescription meds over here:

00:05:42,678 --> 00:05:48,317
Fluoxetine, atorvastatin calcium
and Prevalis.

00:05:48,384 --> 00:05:50,953
And this shipping order for
herbs and vitamins

00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,522
from a store
called Botanica Ventura.

00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:56,091
You want to bet that Botanica
sells more than just herbs?

00:05:56,158 --> 00:05:57,459
That's a good bet.

00:05:57,526 --> 00:05:59,094
STOKES:
What about this blood?

00:06:02,464 --> 00:06:03,799
It's human.

00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:05,968
The fresh drops
are still gummy.

00:06:06,035 --> 00:06:08,504
Older ones are flaky.

00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,272
Multiple events.

00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:13,809
This wasn't Igor's
first trash run.

00:06:16,211 --> 00:06:17,513

Excuse me.

00:06:19,014 --> 00:06:21,684
Did either of you hear
or see anything last night?

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,119
(speaking Japanese)

00:06:24,186 --> 00:06:25,320

00:06:27,656 --> 00:06:29,625

00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:33,662
(yelling in Japanese)

00:06:36,165 --> 00:06:38,734
Uh, just get a Japanese
officer over here to F.I. them.

00:06:38,801 --> 00:06:41,403
Thank you. <i>Arigato.</i>

00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,472
SANDERS:
So you haven't
slept last night?

00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:45,240
I don't know...
Where did those come from?

00:06:45,307 --> 00:06:48,510
I-I-I mean, I think I remember
some, like, stripper chicks,

00:06:48,577 --> 00:06:49,878
like, trying to grind
up on me, you know?

00:06:49,945 --> 00:06:51,080
I don't know, dude.

00:06:51,146 --> 00:06:52,681
I was so faded.

00:06:52,748 --> 00:06:54,183
(coughs)

00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:55,651
I think I'm still drunk.

00:06:55,718 --> 00:06:58,120
All right, dude, well,
we need to get your statement,

00:06:58,187 --> 00:07:01,256
but first,
you need to brush your teeth.

00:07:01,323 --> 00:07:02,458
WILLOWS:
Mr. Crowley, just calm down.

00:07:02,524 --> 00:07:04,093
I'm going to miss my plane.

00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:05,127
So you're not spending
the weekend?

00:07:05,194 --> 00:07:06,628
I'm an actuary.

00:07:06,695 --> 00:07:08,163
It was our
annual meeting.

00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,665
Where were you last night?

00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:12,034
A group of us went to dinner
and a show.

00:07:12,101 --> 00:07:13,168
(phone rings)
I'm going to need their names.

00:07:13,235 --> 00:07:14,169
Well, keep knocking on doors,

00:07:14,236 --> 00:07:15,337
'cause we're all on this floor.

00:07:15,404 --> 00:07:17,539
Thank you for your help.

00:07:17,606 --> 00:07:20,943
Jim, I'm getting a lot
of no answers.

00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:24,480
So get a list of all the guests
on 19 including checkouts.

00:07:24,546 --> 00:07:26,015
Yeah, I'm on it.

00:07:26,081 --> 00:07:28,283
We've been showing Karen Jones'
picture around everywhere.

00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,119
Somebody had to see her.

00:07:30,185 --> 00:07:32,388
Listen, something
may be breaking now.
I'll get back to you.

00:07:32,454 --> 00:07:33,989
What do you got, Joe?

00:07:34,056 --> 00:07:35,324
Bartender recognized
the photo.

00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:37,292
She was here last two nights
with a girlfriend.

00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:38,827
With a prostitute girlfriend?

00:07:38,894 --> 00:07:41,330
Hard to tell, but they had guys
dripping off them

00:07:41,397 --> 00:07:43,632
so if they were working girls,
they were off duty.

00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:44,733
Can you describe
the other woman?

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,835
Smoking body. Brunette.

00:07:46,902 --> 00:07:48,971
<i>I don't remember names. Sorry.</i>

00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:51,173
<i>But I do remember that last</i>
<i>night, the girls got into it.</i>

00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,341
BRASS:
<i>What do you mean?</i>

00:07:52,408 --> 00:07:53,676
BARTENDER:
<i>Well, the blonde asked me</i>

00:07:53,742 --> 00:07:55,911
to quit serving the brunette;
got a little heated.

00:07:55,978 --> 00:07:58,047
Have to say, the girl-fight--
kind of hot.

00:07:58,113 --> 00:08:00,282
Okay.
All right, thanks, thanks.

00:08:14,263 --> 00:08:17,166
WILLOWS:
We got no eyewitnesses on 19.

00:08:17,232 --> 00:08:19,702
Found some white fibers
in her nostril.

00:08:19,768 --> 00:08:22,271
Hotel's bedding and towels
were all white.

00:08:22,338 --> 00:08:26,508
WILLOWS:
Maybe the killer used what
was available to suffocate her.

00:08:26,575 --> 00:08:28,811
68 on the extremities.

00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,582
70 on the abs.

00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:34,650
She's chill.

00:08:37,786 --> 00:08:40,723
All right,
that's our test print.

00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:48,063

00:10:52,654 --> 00:10:55,057
Yes.

00:10:55,124 --> 00:10:58,060
Sometimes I wish
they would tell me more.

00:10:58,127 --> 00:11:00,329
Sometimes I wish
they'd just shut up.

00:11:00,396 --> 00:11:01,730
What are you hearing?

00:11:01,797 --> 00:11:03,966
Well, the blood in his nostrils

00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:08,904
and the petechial dots
on his skin tell me

00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:10,406
that he was
some kind of bleeder.

00:11:10,472 --> 00:11:14,376
His hands are raw

00:11:14,443 --> 00:11:16,111
from detergents
or cleansers

00:11:16,178 --> 00:11:18,080
of some kind--
tells me he worked hard.

00:11:18,147 --> 00:11:23,052
And his teeth, see,
they're worn down by grinding.

00:11:23,118 --> 00:11:25,454
Tells me he was probably
in constant pain,

00:11:25,521 --> 00:11:28,557
but I don't think it was
a problem with the spleen.

00:11:28,624 --> 00:11:30,159
You nailed it.

00:11:30,225 --> 00:11:32,761
The splenectomy was a last-ditch
effort to save his life.

00:11:32,828 --> 00:11:34,663
The purpose
of this surgery

00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,666
was to remove this.

00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:38,901
Supersized cyst.

00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:40,636
It was still in situ.

00:11:40,703 --> 00:11:43,972
Which means the surgeon
was unable to remove it

00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:46,141
because
he was a bleeder.

00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:49,411
Histology showed disseminated
platelet-fibrin

00:11:49,478 --> 00:11:50,446
and microvascular thrombi.

00:11:50,512 --> 00:11:54,416
Idiopathic thrombocytopenia
purpura.

00:11:54,483 --> 00:11:57,119
This boy's immune system
was destroying

00:11:57,186 --> 00:11:59,021
his blood platelets,
inhibiting clotting.

00:11:59,088 --> 00:12:00,989
So the moment
the incision was made,

00:12:01,056 --> 00:12:02,291
the bleeding would have been

00:12:02,358 --> 00:12:05,661
unstoppable and the surgeon
probably panicked.

00:12:05,728 --> 00:12:07,896
And because platelet destruction
occurs in the spleen,

00:12:07,963 --> 00:12:10,466
the surgeon would have hoped
once it was removed,

00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:11,800
new platelets would form

00:12:11,867 --> 00:12:13,836
and his blood would start
clotting again.

00:12:15,871 --> 00:12:18,974
Four months ago,
our Dr. Jekyll made a bow tie

00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,576
<i>with Joey Bigelow's intestines.</i>

00:12:22,378 --> 00:12:24,279
<i>A month ago, he implanted</i>
<i>a superfluous appendix</i>

00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:28,384
<i>into Bernard Higgins.</i>

00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,887
Cystectomy
and splenectomy are...

00:12:31,954 --> 00:12:34,223
routine procedures.

00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:40,253
If he did this, he's not
limiting himself to perversity.

00:12:40,362 --> 00:12:44,033
He's operating both inside
and outside the norm.

00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:45,434
A true Jekyll and Hyde.

00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:52,959
I went through all
the camera footage
from the casino bar.

00:12:53,026 --> 00:12:54,828
Karen Jones and her friend
got there

00:12:54,895 --> 00:12:56,863
around 8:00 last night.

00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:57,964
Well, now we know
what she's wearing:

00:12:58,031 --> 00:12:59,900
Sequined dress,
silver stilettos.

00:12:59,966 --> 00:13:01,768
What about all
these guys?

00:13:01,835 --> 00:13:02,803
Lots of approaches,

00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:04,004
no landings.

00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:05,739
The bartender was right.

00:13:05,806 --> 00:13:08,041
There was an altercation
between the girls.

00:13:08,108 --> 00:13:10,077
Nothing to write
<i>Penthouse</i> about.

00:13:10,143 --> 00:13:13,213
Picked up Karen
at a casino ATM camera

00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,247
about an hour later.

00:13:14,314 --> 00:13:16,216
She's working him.

00:13:16,283 --> 00:13:17,517
He's not interested.

00:13:17,584 --> 00:13:20,220
Probably didn't want
to pay for it.

00:13:20,287 --> 00:13:21,655
Can't blame a girl
for trying, though.

00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:23,256
He's obviously
got cash.

00:13:23,323 --> 00:13:24,591
Exit camera picked her up

00:13:24,658 --> 00:13:28,462
leaving the casino
at 10:37 p.m. solo.

00:13:28,528 --> 00:13:29,930
What time did she come back?

00:13:29,997 --> 00:13:31,098
Around 3:30 a.m.

00:13:31,164 --> 00:13:33,266
Got her going up
the elevator

00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,402
at 3:33, in a hurry.

00:13:35,469 --> 00:13:37,704
Got off on 19.

00:13:37,771 --> 00:13:39,072
So her john
had to be on that floor.

00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:41,375
Probably checked
out by now.

00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:43,210
So what we need to do

00:13:43,276 --> 00:13:45,679
is find that girl
in the blue dress.

00:13:45,746 --> 00:13:48,548
WILLOWS: Have Brass show

ADAMS: First priority
is an I.D. on the bleeder.

00:15:43,964 --> 00:15:46,967
Now, he wasn't in CODIS,
but I did get a familial hit.

00:15:47,034 --> 00:15:48,568
This is Carlos Gomez.

00:15:48,635 --> 00:15:51,004
He's doing time for assault,

00:15:51,071 --> 00:15:52,939
and he I.D.'d the victim's
autopsy photo

00:15:53,006 --> 00:15:54,474
as his son Eduardo.

00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,511
It turns out Eduardo was working
as a night janitor at a motel

00:15:57,577 --> 00:15:59,212
on Bonanza and Albert.

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,647
That's only a couple of blocks

00:16:00,714 --> 00:16:02,382
from where Joey Bigelow
was found.

00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:04,851
Anything on the body
parts or blood evidence?

00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:06,486
Well, the spleen
was the victim's.

00:16:06,553 --> 00:16:08,722
The gallbladder and the fingers
were from

00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:10,123
unrelated donors.

00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,359
And as far as the rest,
I'm working on it.

00:16:12,426 --> 00:16:14,394
What about the surgical
evidence we found
in the trash bags?

00:16:14,461 --> 00:16:16,029
The syringes
all contained

00:16:16,096 --> 00:16:18,031
2% lidocaine solution.

00:16:18,098 --> 00:16:19,633
Local anesthetic
for minor surgeries.

00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,301
And analysis of the
tubing confirmed

00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:24,204
intravenous diazepam--
a Schedule IV

00:16:24,271 --> 00:16:25,706
Controlled Substance;
probably used

00:16:25,772 --> 00:16:27,074
to twilight patients.

00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,209
All the empty bottles
of pharmaceuticals

00:16:29,276 --> 00:16:30,544
were from Mexico;

00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,045
prescription-only,
here and there.

00:16:32,112 --> 00:16:35,248
So maybe Dr. Jekyll
has a Mexico connection.

00:16:35,315 --> 00:16:37,184
Yeah, it could be this
Botanica Ventura place.

00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,485
What do we know about it?

00:16:38,552 --> 00:16:39,486
It's a storefront leased

00:16:39,553 --> 00:16:40,821

Jeffrey Hughes.

00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:42,322
Now there were
good clean

drug bottles,

00:16:43,457 --> 00:16:44,591
I just can't confirm
they're his.

00:16:44,658 --> 00:16:46,193
No AFIS hits.

00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:47,728
So we're gonna go check him out.
Warrant's on its way.

00:16:47,794 --> 00:16:49,229

You've seen my customers.

00:17:44,851 --> 00:17:46,586
Their ancestors were the Maya.

00:17:46,653 --> 00:17:49,790
The Mayans believe that wellness
resides in a balance

00:17:49,856 --> 00:17:53,226
of body and spirit;
man and God.

00:17:53,293 --> 00:17:55,495
We're not here

If there was an

it would have been
in the middle of the room.

some light.

All right, that's bright enough
for surgery.

00:19:29,356 --> 00:19:31,391

Oh. Ms. Rose has got
quite a few contusions.

00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,943
WILLOWS:
Yeah. Defensive wounds.

00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:10,545
Nasty lump on her forehead.

00:23:10,612 --> 00:23:12,981
No internal hemorrhaging,
not fatal but

00:23:13,048 --> 00:23:14,549
probably happened
during the struggle.

00:23:14,616 --> 00:23:15,517
What's C.O.D.?

00:23:15,584 --> 00:23:17,352
Petechial hemorrhaging

00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:19,721
in the eyes and lips...

00:23:19,788 --> 00:23:21,356
white marks, but...

00:23:21,423 --> 00:23:22,991
no indentations in the neck.

00:23:23,058 --> 00:23:25,494
Just like her friend--
she was asphyxiated.

00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,263
Uh, didn't find any trace
in her nose or esophagus.

00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:32,300
She was suffocated
<i>before</i> she was put
into that box spring.

00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:33,969
Any indication
what time she died?

00:23:34,036 --> 00:23:35,871
Ballpark: Sometime
between midnight

00:23:35,937 --> 00:23:38,407
and 4:00 a.m.

00:23:38,473 --> 00:23:40,809
Karen Jones and Jillian Rose,

00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:43,812
friends from the same town,
sharing the same room,

00:23:43,879 --> 00:23:46,715
killed in a similar manner
around the same time.

00:23:46,782 --> 00:23:49,518
But their bodies were found
in two different locations.

00:23:49,584 --> 00:23:50,986
Are we looking
for <i>two</i> killers?

00:23:51,053 --> 00:23:53,088
My gut says that we're not.

00:23:53,155 --> 00:23:55,590
Well, if just one guy did this,

00:23:55,657 --> 00:23:57,926
she had to have
been killed first.

00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:02,297
So the blood in the truck bed
and the trash bags

00:24:02,364 --> 00:24:04,566
came from multiple donors,
both male and female.

00:24:04,633 --> 00:24:06,134
Including Eduardo Gomez?

00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:07,536
And you were right--

00:24:07,602 --> 00:24:10,238
<i>that was his blood</i>
<i>in the grout.</i>

00:24:13,008 --> 00:24:16,011
But I also found a second
contributor in the grout sample.

00:24:16,078 --> 00:24:18,113
It was an unknown male.

00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,581
They're probably
my epithelials.

00:24:19,648 --> 00:24:22,551
I had to palpate the
grout-- you can't do
that with gloves on.

00:24:22,617 --> 00:24:25,087
Well, in that case, I just
need a sample of your DNA,

00:24:25,153 --> 00:24:26,254
and I will exclude you.

00:24:26,321 --> 00:24:29,558
My DNA-- which would
go into a database.

00:24:29,624 --> 00:24:33,362
Your fingerprints are already
in AFIS-- what's the difference?

00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:35,464
There's a big difference.

00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:39,334
You're gonna have to put
in your report that I said no.

00:24:56,918 --> 00:24:58,520
Mrs. Hughes.

00:24:58,587 --> 00:25:01,356
We have a warrant
to search the premises.

00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,642
(slaps folder down)

00:25:20,709 --> 00:25:22,577
LANGSTON:
All right, Mr. Hughes,

00:25:22,644 --> 00:25:25,914
Eduardo Gomez died
in your operating room.

00:25:25,981 --> 00:25:27,516
I don't have
an operating room.

00:25:27,582 --> 00:25:29,151
But you knew him.

00:25:29,217 --> 00:25:30,819
I knew his whole family.

00:25:30,886 --> 00:25:32,754
His mother was a loyal customer.

00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:34,623
Did you tell his mother
that you dumped him

00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:37,826
with the rest of the trash
from your other surgeries?

00:25:37,893 --> 00:25:39,361
I mean, it must have
been a busy night.

00:25:39,428 --> 00:25:42,597
You, um, removed
a gallbladder;

00:25:42,664 --> 00:25:45,333
you amputated a
gangrenous finger;

00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,904
you attempted to remove
Eduardo's abdominal cyst.

00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,540
So tell me, where
did you train, Doctor?

00:25:53,442 --> 00:25:55,444
I graduated premed

00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,478
<i>at Harvard,</i>

00:25:56,545 --> 00:25:59,181
<i>and celebrated in Cozumel,</i>

00:25:59,247 --> 00:26:01,983
<i>where I fell in love</i>
<i>with a local girl.</i>

00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,051
<i>So I, uh,</i>

00:26:03,118 --> 00:26:04,986
<i>went to medical school</i>
<i>in Guadalajara</i>

00:26:05,053 --> 00:26:07,255
<i>and trained at a hospital</i>
<i>in Monterey.</i>

00:26:08,457 --> 00:26:09,925
LANGSTON:
<i>And are you licensed</i>

00:26:09,991 --> 00:26:12,027
<i>to practice</i>
<i>in the United States?</i>

00:26:12,094 --> 00:26:13,995
HUGHES:
<i>You know the answer to that.</i>

00:26:14,062 --> 00:26:15,831
LANGSTON:
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

00:26:15,897 --> 00:26:17,432
So you were
smuggling drugs,

00:26:17,499 --> 00:26:19,801
you were practicing
without a license in
unsafe conditions,

00:26:19,868 --> 00:26:22,504
all of which cost
Eduardo Gomez his life.

00:26:22,571 --> 00:26:24,639
I was trying to save his life!

00:26:24,706 --> 00:26:27,275
He is the sole support
of his mother

00:26:27,342 --> 00:26:28,410
and his newborn sister.

00:26:28,477 --> 00:26:30,045
They're here
without documentation.

00:26:30,112 --> 00:26:31,446
No insurance.

00:26:31,513 --> 00:26:33,148
He was in so much pain,

00:26:33,215 --> 00:26:35,250
he couldn't travel
to Mexico for surgery.

00:26:35,317 --> 00:26:37,052
I couldn't turn him away.
Eduardo presented

00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:39,554
with obvious signs of ITP.

00:26:39,621 --> 00:26:41,123
I misdiagnosed.

00:26:41,189 --> 00:26:43,658
<i>By the time I knew what was</i>
<i>going on, it was too late.</i>

00:26:43,725 --> 00:26:45,894
<i>His mother was there.</i>

00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:47,763
<i>She made the decision</i>
<i>to dispose of the body.</i>

00:26:47,829 --> 00:26:48,897
<i>She doesn't blame me.</i>

00:26:48,964 --> 00:26:51,266
I delivered her baby!

00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,769
Her perfectly healthy infant.

00:26:53,835 --> 00:26:56,805
Eduardo was the first patient
ever to die in my care.

00:26:56,872 --> 00:26:58,340
Well, what about
Joey Bigelow

00:26:58,407 --> 00:27:00,175
and Bernard Higgins?

00:27:00,242 --> 00:27:01,443
Hmm?

00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,078
What about them?

00:27:04,946 --> 00:27:07,416
I don't know these men.

00:27:09,284 --> 00:27:11,253
This isn't medicine.

00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:14,589
Look, I don't run
a practice to get rich.

00:27:14,656 --> 00:27:17,492
I... help those
the system ignores.

00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:19,895
The nanny whose gallbladder
is inflamed,

00:27:19,961 --> 00:27:23,432
the gardener who risks his life
for a gangrenous finger.

00:27:23,498 --> 00:27:26,168
There are clinics,
social services

00:27:26,234 --> 00:27:29,237
for that kind of thing.
Reform health care all you want.

00:27:29,304 --> 00:27:32,040
My patients are always
gonna be left out.

00:27:39,247 --> 00:27:42,217
Had the casino send over
some more surveillance footage,

00:27:42,284 --> 00:27:45,587
this time tracking our
second victim, Jillian Rose.

00:27:45,654 --> 00:27:49,358
Started with Karen
and Jillian at the bar,

00:27:49,424 --> 00:27:51,426
and I noticed something.

00:27:51,493 --> 00:27:53,395
A few minutes after
their little argument,

00:27:53,462 --> 00:27:57,599
Karen and Jillian went
on the hunt-- separately.

00:28:01,703 --> 00:28:03,071
That's when I found this.

00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:09,111
WILLOWS: Oh, she landed
the ATM guy.

00:28:09,177 --> 00:28:11,279
The one that Karen couldn't.

00:28:11,346 --> 00:28:13,482
They got off on 19.

00:28:13,548 --> 00:28:17,319
STOKES: Six minutes later,
she's texting, coming down.

00:28:17,386 --> 00:28:19,721
That's not even enough time
for a quickie.

00:28:19,788 --> 00:28:21,323
<i>And</i> why would

00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:25,394
two hookers go after
the same john?

00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,730
'Cause maybe
they aren't hookers.

00:28:28,797 --> 00:28:32,134
And I don't think
this is about sex.

00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,035
Karen Jones and Jillian Rose
were running a con.

00:29:07,102 --> 00:29:09,137
One of them would steal
the guy's PIN number,

00:29:09,204 --> 00:29:10,772
the other would steal
his credit card.

00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:12,407
Who am I looking at?
Their mark.

00:29:12,474 --> 00:29:14,042
That's Karen with
him at the ATM,

00:29:14,109 --> 00:29:16,311
and an hour later,
Jillian went up to his room

00:29:16,378 --> 00:29:17,312
on the 19th floor.

00:29:17,379 --> 00:29:18,513
We never talked to him,

00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,682
so he's got to be one
of the checkouts.

00:29:20,749 --> 00:29:23,385
Let's go back
to the Mediterranean.

00:29:26,054 --> 00:29:28,190
BRASS:
<i>So, the room is registered</i>

00:29:28,256 --> 00:29:29,624
to Donald Fiore.

00:29:29,691 --> 00:29:32,427
He works as an actuary;
he's here for the convention.

00:29:32,494 --> 00:29:34,663
The maid I.D.'d him
from a photo.

00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,565
She said she saw nothing unusual
when she cleaned up, so...

00:29:36,631 --> 00:29:38,500
SANDERS:
We're only three doors down

00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:40,469
from where we found
Karen Jones' body.

00:29:40,535 --> 00:29:41,803
When did Fiore check out?
Well, he didn't.

00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,038
He left his key in the room,

00:29:43,105 --> 00:29:44,573
and the hotel automatically
checks him out at noon.

00:29:44,639 --> 00:29:47,142
Right, so he could've
checked out anytime.
Fiore lives

00:29:47,209 --> 00:29:48,810
in Salt Lake City--
I spoke to the local cops.

00:29:48,877 --> 00:29:51,346
(phone rings)
They said they'd
keep an eye on him,

00:29:51,413 --> 00:29:52,881
but they weren't
gonna arrest him

00:29:52,948 --> 00:29:54,316
until we provided them
with more evidence.

00:29:54,383 --> 00:29:55,751
I gotta take this.
Good luck.

00:29:57,586 --> 00:30:00,756
Brass. Talk to me.
(door shuts)
Okay. So...

00:30:00,822 --> 00:30:03,592
the maid would have vacuumed,
emptied the trash,

00:30:03,658 --> 00:30:05,994
cleaned the bathroom,

00:30:06,061 --> 00:30:07,763
changed the towels...

00:30:07,829 --> 00:30:09,498
And the sheets, too.

00:30:09,564 --> 00:30:11,700
Hotel laundry will
all be commingled.

00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:14,903
And if he threw her clothes
in the trash, well...

00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,739
that's like looking for a needle
inside a stack of needles,

00:30:17,806 --> 00:30:20,575
so... what part
of the room remains

00:30:20,642 --> 00:30:23,045
from guest to guest?

00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,982
(door opens)

00:30:34,956 --> 00:30:36,958
♪ ♪

00:30:54,476 --> 00:30:57,012
STOKES: Looks like somebody
messed with this vent.

00:31:08,957 --> 00:31:10,959
Oh...
Got a pair of shoes.

00:31:11,026 --> 00:31:13,862
No dress, though.

00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:17,032
Karen Jones...

00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:19,301
had silver stilettos.

00:31:19,368 --> 00:31:21,603
They're all wet.

00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:24,172
I didn't see any condensation
in the vent.

00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:26,808
Heels have been
snapped off.

00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,745
And the soles
are... are bent.

00:31:29,811 --> 00:31:33,315
I mean... this didn't
happen during the struggle.

00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,889
He was trying
to get rid of these.

00:32:09,951 --> 00:32:10,852
(sighs)

00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:12,120
He flushed the dress,

00:32:12,187 --> 00:32:13,889
but he couldn't get
the shoes to go down.

00:32:27,536 --> 00:32:30,672
SANDERS: <i>If the dress</i>
<i>is still in this pipe,</i>

00:32:30,739 --> 00:32:32,841
then the toilet
would be backed up.

00:32:32,908 --> 00:32:35,544
And you know
what rolls downhill.

00:32:39,981 --> 00:32:42,551
Okay. We're ready.

00:32:58,734 --> 00:33:00,736
(flushing)

00:33:11,146 --> 00:33:12,748
Greg, stop.

00:33:12,814 --> 00:33:14,750
We've got something.

00:33:15,884 --> 00:33:17,919
How may feet of cable
do you have out?

00:33:17,986 --> 00:33:19,821
Uh, about 20.

00:33:19,888 --> 00:33:21,189
About ten feet per floor.

00:33:21,256 --> 00:33:22,491
So, that's...

00:33:22,557 --> 00:33:24,059
Two floors below.

00:33:24,126 --> 00:33:26,261
1721.

00:33:26,328 --> 00:33:28,330
(power saw grinding)

00:33:52,788 --> 00:33:54,790
(groans)

00:33:55,891 --> 00:33:57,993
I think that's enough
to compel a warrant.

00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:07,042
I didn't realize I was set up
until I was in the shower.

00:34:07,109 --> 00:34:09,444
Oh, God, your body
is unbelievable!

00:34:09,511 --> 00:34:11,813
And you'll get to
taste all of it.
(moans)

00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,682
As soon as you shower.

00:34:13,749 --> 00:34:15,183
I'll be right here,

00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,319
thinking about what
I'm going to do to you.

00:34:20,922 --> 00:34:22,924
(shower running)

00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:36,038
FIORE:
<i>She stole my wallet.</i>

00:34:36,104 --> 00:34:37,572
I should have known.

00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,974
She was...

00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:40,642
too beautiful
to be a hooker.

00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:42,677
I called my bank,
found out that they had

00:34:42,744 --> 00:34:45,247
used my credit
card and PIN,

00:34:45,313 --> 00:34:47,549
took a $2,000 cash advance.

00:34:47,616 --> 00:34:51,186
That's a $50 bank charge,
accrues at 28% interest.

00:34:51,253 --> 00:34:52,821
Why didn't you just report it?

00:34:52,888 --> 00:34:55,057
Well, if I called the cops
and you found them,

00:34:55,123 --> 00:34:56,591
then there would be reports

00:34:56,658 --> 00:34:58,727
saying that I had brought
a girl back to my room,

00:34:58,794 --> 00:35:00,862
and I couldn't take the risk
of my wife finding out.

00:35:00,929 --> 00:35:03,498
She's an heiress.

00:35:03,565 --> 00:35:05,867
Has all the money.

00:35:05,934 --> 00:35:09,004
Simple cost-benefit analysis.

00:35:09,071 --> 00:35:10,872
How does that analysis work?

00:35:10,939 --> 00:35:12,708
Their lives for your wallet?

00:35:12,774 --> 00:35:13,875
The solve rates

00:35:13,942 --> 00:35:15,677
for murders, for homicides
in Clark County?

00:35:15,744 --> 00:35:17,679
62%.

00:35:17,746 --> 00:35:19,881
My wife finds out
that I'm philandering?

00:35:19,948 --> 00:35:22,684
That's a 100% chance of divorce.

00:35:22,751 --> 00:35:23,885
But since
you didn't cheat,

00:35:23,952 --> 00:35:25,520
you figured
that she would be okay

00:35:25,587 --> 00:35:27,589
with you murdering
Karen and Jillian?

00:35:27,656 --> 00:35:29,591
I never saw Jillian again.

00:35:29,658 --> 00:35:30,926
As far as her friend goes,

00:35:30,992 --> 00:35:32,561
she came looking for me.

00:35:34,529 --> 00:35:36,031
(door closes)

00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:38,767
You want it back?
It's gonna cost you.

00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:40,769
Just-Just give it to me,
and I'll forget the whole thing.

00:35:40,836 --> 00:35:42,771
I don't think so.

00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:45,974
FIORE:
<i>I saw that the safety</i>
<i>was still on, so...</i>

00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:48,276
<i>I took my chances.</i>

00:35:48,343 --> 00:35:52,013
Prostitutes are 60 to
100 times more likely

00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,648
to be murdered than
non-prostitutes.

00:35:53,715 --> 00:35:56,418
So I flushed the dress, and I
pulled her out into the hallway.

00:35:56,485 --> 00:35:57,586
I calculated the likelihood

00:35:57,652 --> 00:35:59,221
that you would think
that she was a hooker

00:35:59,287 --> 00:36:00,455
and wouldn't be a priority.

00:36:00,522 --> 00:36:01,923
You calculated wrong.

00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:04,393
Regardless, I acted
in self-defense.

00:36:04,459 --> 00:36:05,894
Yeah, right up until
you suffocated her.

00:36:05,961 --> 00:36:08,730
Well, acquittal rates
for self-defense claims

00:36:08,797 --> 00:36:11,099
are very high-- jurors
tend to judge the motives

00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:13,268
of a beautiful con woman
much more harshly

00:36:13,335 --> 00:36:16,705
than an overworked actuary.

00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:32,521
♪ ♪

00:36:56,411 --> 00:36:57,579
Hodges.

00:36:57,646 --> 00:36:58,747
Yeah?

00:36:58,814 --> 00:37:01,149
I need you to tell me
what this is.

00:37:03,085 --> 00:37:04,352
Gray fibers.

00:37:04,419 --> 00:37:07,989
Maybe a recycled
synthetic.

00:37:10,292 --> 00:37:11,693
Oh, yeah.

00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,862
It's polyester
polyfill fiber.

00:37:13,929 --> 00:37:16,365
Commonly used in
box spring padding.

00:37:16,431 --> 00:37:19,568
Don't you have to do
an FTIR to confirm that?

00:37:19,634 --> 00:37:20,702
Just did one.

00:37:20,769 --> 00:37:22,404
On your motel girl;

00:37:22,471 --> 00:37:24,039
the one stuffed into
the box spring.

00:37:24,106 --> 00:37:27,709
Are you saying this fiber
is from the same box spring?

00:37:27,776 --> 00:37:30,746
I'm just saying that it's
the same type of material.

00:37:30,812 --> 00:37:32,347
Your two victims
shared the room.

00:37:32,414 --> 00:37:35,517
What are the chances that
it's not from that box spring?

00:37:37,052 --> 00:37:40,155
Karen had to have come into
contact with the box spring

00:37:40,222 --> 00:37:41,957
after it was cut open.

00:37:42,024 --> 00:37:44,292
Which puts her in the room
after Jillian was dead.

00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:46,595
Or after Karen killed her.

00:37:46,661 --> 00:37:48,630
I'd hate to think Fiore's
telling the truth.

00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,039
Okay, so, there were no fibers

00:37:57,105 --> 00:37:59,574
in Jillian's nose or throat.

00:37:59,641 --> 00:38:02,611
So Karen had to have used
something non-textile

00:38:02,677 --> 00:38:03,812
to asphyxiate her.

00:38:03,879 --> 00:38:05,447
Shower curtain was intact.

00:38:05,514 --> 00:38:09,451
Plastic laundry bags were
clean and folded in the closet.

00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:19,027
Trash can liner.

00:38:19,094 --> 00:38:21,963
STOKES:
There was nothing in it,
so I didn't collect it.

00:38:22,964 --> 00:38:25,233
You had no reason to.

00:38:29,504 --> 00:38:32,274
STOKES: Looks like
a lipstick smudge to me.

00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,477
Who kisses a trash bag?

00:38:35,544 --> 00:38:37,746
Maybe a girl fighting
for her life.

00:38:57,032 --> 00:38:58,266
Those are carpal prints.

00:38:59,701 --> 00:39:02,104
WILLOWS: No way those
are Karen's prints.

00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,672
They're too big.

00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:04,573
<i>Karen didn't kill her.</i>

00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:06,141
(Karen gasps, screams)

00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:08,477
SANDERS:
<i>She came back to the room</i>
<i>and found Jillian dead.</i>

00:39:08,543 --> 00:39:12,414
Then Karen hid Jillian
inside the box spring

00:39:12,481 --> 00:39:14,015
<i>to buy herself some time.</i>

00:39:14,082 --> 00:39:16,418
WILLOWS:
<i>She then...</i>

00:39:16,485 --> 00:39:18,220
took the wallet over
to the hotel room

00:39:18,286 --> 00:39:19,755
and tried to extort money
from Fiore.

00:39:19,821 --> 00:39:22,791
Live by the con,
die by the con.

00:39:28,597 --> 00:39:30,465
Mr. Fiore.

00:39:30,532 --> 00:39:33,001
There's been a development.

00:39:33,068 --> 00:39:34,336
We need your
major case prints.

00:39:34,403 --> 00:39:37,739
I already gave you my prints.

00:39:37,806 --> 00:39:41,376
And I admitted to killing
Karen Jones in self-defense.

00:39:41,443 --> 00:39:43,311
That was a standard ten-card.

00:39:43,378 --> 00:39:44,780
Give me your right hand.

00:39:44,846 --> 00:39:45,881
And if I refuse?

00:39:45,947 --> 00:39:47,149
Then I'm going to get six

00:39:47,215 --> 00:39:49,284
of the biggest deputies
you've ever seen

00:39:49,351 --> 00:39:52,020
to come in here and assist you.

00:39:59,227 --> 00:40:01,363
(scanner whirrs)

00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,331
(rapid electronic trilling)

00:40:17,345 --> 00:40:18,647
Jillian Rose

00:40:18,714 --> 00:40:22,250
was suffocated with a trash
liner from her motel room,

00:40:22,317 --> 00:40:24,019
and your prints are on it.

00:40:24,086 --> 00:40:25,921
How did you find out
where she was staying?

00:40:25,987 --> 00:40:28,857
I wanted my wallet back.

00:40:28,924 --> 00:40:31,460
FIORE:
<i>I went out looking for Jillian,</i>

00:40:31,526 --> 00:40:33,962
<i>and I saw her</i>
<i>at the casino next door.</i>

00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:36,031
<i>She jumped into a cab,</i>
<i>and I followed her.</i>

00:40:37,132 --> 00:40:40,102
(lock clicks, door opens,
then shuts)

00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:46,241
(knocking on door)

00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:49,845
Open up or I'll call the police.

00:40:49,911 --> 00:40:51,380
Give me my wallet,
you bitch!

00:40:51,446 --> 00:40:52,481
I don't have it!

00:40:52,547 --> 00:40:53,615
Give me my wallet!
I swear!

00:40:53,682 --> 00:40:55,684
I want my wallet!

00:41:02,157 --> 00:41:03,425
(muffled screams)

00:41:06,628 --> 00:41:08,864
It was
a mathematical certainty

00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,966
that a woman like that
would report the assault

00:41:11,033 --> 00:41:13,335
or she would blackmail me
for the rest of my life.

00:41:13,402 --> 00:41:15,404
The only logical thing
to do was to kill her.

00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,539
And you applied
that same logic

00:41:17,606 --> 00:41:19,608
when Karen Jones showed up
at your door?

00:41:19,674 --> 00:41:20,809
(chuckles)

00:41:20,876 --> 00:41:23,111
You know what that
stupid girl did?

00:41:23,178 --> 00:41:25,347
She-She pointed a gun at me,

00:41:25,414 --> 00:41:28,350
and she demanded
that I give her $50,000

00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:29,785
for her friend's funeral.

00:41:30,819 --> 00:41:32,654
Well, according to my math,

00:41:32,721 --> 00:41:35,057
the $50,000 that you saved

00:41:35,123 --> 00:41:37,592
is going to cost you
20 years to life.

00:41:41,196 --> 00:41:42,597
W-Wait...

00:41:42,664 --> 00:41:43,965
Look, I-I am a good man.

00:41:44,032 --> 00:41:45,901
I work hard.

00:41:45,967 --> 00:41:47,069
I love my wife.

00:41:47,135 --> 00:41:48,670
I contribute to society.

00:41:48,737 --> 00:41:49,805
I mean, these people,

00:41:49,871 --> 00:41:51,606
you deal with them all the time.
And those girls?

00:41:51,673 --> 00:41:53,108
They were just... they were
just worthless criminals.

00:41:53,175 --> 00:41:55,610
No, they were human beings.

00:41:55,677 --> 00:41:58,213
You're the worthless criminal.

00:42:11,493 --> 00:42:12,661
Okay, I'll come by your place.

00:42:12,728 --> 00:42:14,730
No, no, it's cool.
I have tomorrow off.

00:42:14,796 --> 00:42:15,897
Hey, Nick?

00:42:15,964 --> 00:42:17,132
STOKES:
I'll call you back.

00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:19,601
Listen, I need
to talk to you.

00:42:19,668 --> 00:42:22,003
Uh, I had Wendy
run the markers

00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,606
for race on the appendix
implanted in Bernard Higgins.

00:42:24,673 --> 00:42:27,042
It was
non-Hispanic Caucasian.

00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:30,612
Now, all the body parts we found
in the truck were Hispanic.

00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:33,215
I don't think Hughes
is Dr. Jekyll.

00:42:33,281 --> 00:42:35,317
Regardless, we-we got him
for drug trafficking.

00:42:35,384 --> 00:42:37,652
We got him for practicing
without a license

00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:39,554
and Eduardo Gomez's death.

00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:41,857
Yeah. Yeah.
He's not going anywhere.

00:42:41,923 --> 00:42:43,859
Agreed.

00:42:43,925 --> 00:42:45,327
I need a favor.

00:42:45,394 --> 00:42:47,229
I think your Spanish is a
little better than mine.

00:42:47,295 --> 00:42:49,798
Would you take a look
at that for me, please?

00:42:49,865 --> 00:42:51,833
(clears throat)

00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,735
<i>"Clinica gratis."</i>

00:42:53,802 --> 00:42:55,704
Okay. Free clinic.

<i>"Pedíatra, emergencias,</i>

I thought I was the only one
trying to save the world.

00:43:03,412 --> 00:43:04,713
(chuckles)

00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,915
I don't approve of the
way Hughes went about it,

00:43:06,982 --> 00:43:08,717
but he had the right idea.

00:43:08,784 --> 00:43:10,519
This clinic I volunteer at,

00:43:10,585 --> 00:43:13,855
it's safe, it's free,
it's legal.

00:43:13,922 --> 00:43:16,992
I just want to
spread the word.
