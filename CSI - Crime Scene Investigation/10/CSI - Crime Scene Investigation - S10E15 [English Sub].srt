00:00:05,164 --> 00:00:09,535
BOY:
<i>This is the part</i>
<i>where it gets scary.</i>

00:00:09,602 --> 00:00:12,166
This is the part where
everybody's panicking

00:00:12,233 --> 00:00:14,235
because the bad guys are coming.

00:00:14,302 --> 00:00:16,237
BOY 2:
Wait, where'd you
see this movie?

00:00:16,304 --> 00:00:19,407
It's not a movie, okay,
it's a book.

00:00:21,209 --> 00:00:26,214
But anyways, everybody is
scared, except for one boy.

00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:29,584
<i>He is the bravest one.</i>

00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:38,560
<i>So can I go ahead</i>
<i>and open it?</i>

00:00:38,626 --> 00:00:39,928
WOMAN:
<i>Yes.</i>

00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:48,303
Oh, Mom, this is exactly
the one I wanted!

00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:50,071
WOMAN:
Is that
the good one?

00:00:50,138 --> 00:00:51,606
Where did you get this?

00:00:53,675 --> 00:00:55,076
Oh, my gosh.

00:00:55,143 --> 00:00:56,211
Come here.

00:00:56,277 --> 00:00:57,545
Stop.

00:00:57,612 --> 00:00:58,646
(laughing)

00:00:58,713 --> 00:01:00,582
This is the best
mom in the world.

00:01:00,648 --> 00:01:02,116
Ah, I love you, baby.

00:01:02,183 --> 00:01:03,151
Love you, too.

00:01:03,218 --> 00:01:04,519
I have legal proof now.

00:01:04,586 --> 00:01:06,287
I'm the best mom.

00:01:37,018 --> 00:01:38,786
(car door closes)

00:01:38,853 --> 00:01:40,421
(flies buzzing)

00:01:40,488 --> 00:01:41,890
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:45,593
BRASS:
At 6:47 a.m., an anonymous
phone call was made

00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,097
from a pay phone on the I-15
by an adult male.

00:01:49,163 --> 00:01:51,866
The caller said he drove by
and saw the body.

00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:54,536
Sunrise was at 6:54 a.m.
this morning.

00:01:54,602 --> 00:01:56,871
Would have been too dark
for even an eagle-eyed passerby

00:01:56,938 --> 00:01:58,573
to spot the body
from that distance.

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,175
Have one of your guys
dust that pay phone for prints.

00:02:01,242 --> 00:02:02,677
We might get
something off it.

00:02:02,744 --> 00:02:04,445
I'm gonna check with
missing persons. Good luck.

00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:05,947
Yeah, I'll handle it.
Thanks, Jim.

00:02:06,014 --> 00:02:07,415
Morning, Doc.
Nick.

00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:08,449
What's going on?

00:02:08,516 --> 00:02:09,684
Well, he's been dead

00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:12,620
about four to eight hours
based on liver temp.

00:02:12,687 --> 00:02:13,955
Depressed skull fracture

00:02:14,022 --> 00:02:16,724
with a laceration
to the overlying scalp.

00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,326
C.O.D. is most likely

00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:21,496
contusion
of the brain

00:02:21,563 --> 00:02:23,031
and a subdural hemorrhage.

00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:24,699
The breadth of the depression

00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:27,402
suggests impact
with a wide, flat surface.

00:02:27,468 --> 00:02:29,137
A wound like that
with no blood pool?

00:02:29,204 --> 00:02:30,271
Nope.

00:02:30,338 --> 00:02:31,539
A body dump.

00:02:39,614 --> 00:02:41,683
Dried blood underneath
his fingernails.

00:02:41,749 --> 00:02:43,585
I'll bag his hands,

00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:45,320
preserve any evidence
for transport.

00:02:45,386 --> 00:02:46,788
Okay, if I check
his pockets?

00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:49,057
Go for it.

00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:56,898
Compass, pocket knife.

00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:01,436
Music.

00:03:03,171 --> 00:03:04,873
Food rations.

00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:07,475
Possible runaway.

00:03:11,045 --> 00:03:12,513
A flashlight

00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,216
with "East Las Vegas
High School" on it.

00:03:15,283 --> 00:03:18,219
Well, if he was a student, he
had to be at least 14 years old.

00:03:18,286 --> 00:03:20,121
He's kind of small
for that age.

00:03:20,188 --> 00:03:21,990
I'll get a photo
over to the school.

00:03:24,492 --> 00:03:26,294
You know, I was really small
when I was 14.

00:03:26,361 --> 00:03:27,395
Yeah?

00:03:27,462 --> 00:03:28,596
Yeah. Made me ambitious.

00:03:28,663 --> 00:03:31,599
So what did you want to be
when you were 14?

00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,602
Probably the same thing

00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:35,837
he most wanted to be--

00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:38,973
fifteen.

WILLOWS:
When was the last time
you saw your son?

00:04:25,528 --> 00:04:31,434
I didn't even look in
Will's room last night
when I got home from work.

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,769
Didn't check on him.

00:04:33,836 --> 00:04:36,072
And when did
you get home?

00:04:36,138 --> 00:04:37,840
(sniffs)

00:04:37,907 --> 00:04:40,076
Uh, club closed at 2:00.

00:04:40,142 --> 00:04:42,778
Cashed out, divided up my tips
with the other waitresses.

00:04:42,845 --> 00:04:46,148
It was-- it was about 3:00.

00:04:46,215 --> 00:04:48,918
I thought I was letting him
sleep in this morning,

00:04:48,985 --> 00:04:50,720
till I got the call.

00:04:50,786 --> 00:04:52,488
Ms. Sutter, do
you have any idea

00:04:52,555 --> 00:04:54,390
where he might have been
going last night?

00:04:54,457 --> 00:04:56,559
Who he might have been with?

00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,328
He knows not to open the door
for anyone,

00:04:59,395 --> 00:05:02,698
or-or leave without calling me.

00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:04,433
A million times
we've gone over it.

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,736
And where's
his father?

00:05:06,802 --> 00:05:08,170
He's not in Will's life.

00:05:08,237 --> 00:05:10,439
WILLOWS:
Do you know if Will
had tried to contact him?

00:05:10,506 --> 00:05:13,909
Because a boy Will's age

00:05:13,976 --> 00:05:17,179
starting to think about
growing up, manhood--

00:05:17,246 --> 00:05:20,182
sometimes they seek
out a mentor.

00:05:20,249 --> 00:05:22,585
SUTTER:
Will's father
is no mentor.

00:05:22,652 --> 00:05:24,453
He's hardly a man.

00:05:25,955 --> 00:05:28,324
I will still need
to be in touch with him.

00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:30,126
His name's Billy Melvoy.

00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:31,560
Your line of work--

00:05:31,627 --> 00:05:34,163
you're more likely
to bump into him than I will.

00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,798
What about Will's friends?

00:05:35,865 --> 00:05:37,400
Were any of them driving yet?

00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:38,668
No.

00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:41,337
No, he's-- he's got
two best friends.

00:05:41,404 --> 00:05:42,705
They're 14, too.

00:05:42,772 --> 00:05:44,540
Mason and Steve.

00:05:44,607 --> 00:05:46,909
They live down the street.

00:05:46,976 --> 00:05:48,110
They've all grown up together.

00:05:48,177 --> 00:05:51,180
So they spent a lot
of time with Will?

00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:54,183
More than I ever got to.

00:06:08,046 --> 00:06:09,248
(camera shutter clicking)

00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:42,981
♪ ♪

00:06:50,556 --> 00:06:52,658
Found a small crack
in the front window,

00:06:52,724 --> 00:06:53,992
but no prints.

00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:56,028
Other than that,
the perimeter's clean.

00:06:56,094 --> 00:06:57,496
No sign of forced entry.

00:06:57,563 --> 00:06:58,897
That's not surprising
when you consider

00:06:58,964 --> 00:07:00,866
how much equipment
Will had in his pockets.

00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:04,469
It's clear he wasn't
dragged out of his bed
in the middle of the night.

00:07:04,536 --> 00:07:06,004
He was prepared for something.

00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:08,874
He's got the whole universe

00:07:08,941 --> 00:07:11,710
and all of human
history here.

00:07:11,777 --> 00:07:14,880
So what was he out
in search of?

00:07:14,947 --> 00:07:16,648
Or... what was he
running away from?

00:07:16,715 --> 00:07:18,250
Right.

00:07:22,888 --> 00:07:27,993
Got his recent
online activity here.

00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,062

Open this one, please.

00:07:38,403 --> 00:07:40,339

You must be
Mason Ward.
Yeah.

00:07:54,953 --> 00:07:56,421
Yeah, hi, I'm Nick Stokes.
I'm with the crime lab.

00:07:56,488 --> 00:07:58,056
I'm going to be asking
you a few questions.

00:07:58,123 --> 00:07:59,591
Go ahead and
have a seat.
Okay.

00:07:59,658 --> 00:08:01,827
Now do you want a soda
or something to eat

00:08:01,894 --> 00:08:02,895
before we
get started?

00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:04,096
Nah. The vending machines
here suck.

00:08:04,162 --> 00:08:07,266
Yeah, yeah, I'd have
to agree with that.

00:08:07,332 --> 00:08:08,934
Now how do you know
something like that?

00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:10,002
You come here often?

00:08:10,068 --> 00:08:11,036
My dad's a cop.

00:08:11,103 --> 00:08:12,304
I've been around.

00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:13,405
Oh, okay.

00:08:13,472 --> 00:08:15,140
Then you know how
important it is

00:08:15,207 --> 00:08:16,842
that you help me
figure out what happened

00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:18,210
to your friend
last night.

00:08:18,277 --> 00:08:19,945
Right.

00:08:20,012 --> 00:08:24,783
Will wasn't
really my friend anymore.

00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:25,984
Steve, Will's mom said

00:08:26,051 --> 00:08:27,920
that you and Mason
are Will's best friends.

00:08:27,986 --> 00:08:31,056
Yeah, we were.

00:08:31,123 --> 00:08:32,457
It's just
different now.

00:08:32,524 --> 00:08:33,892
How so?

00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:36,628
Will would still ask us
to, like, ride bikes

00:08:36,695 --> 00:08:39,431
or look for lizards
in the park,

00:08:39,498 --> 00:08:41,133
but we're not
into that anymore.

00:08:44,369 --> 00:08:46,305
What are you into now?
MASON:
<i>Girls.</i>

00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:48,273
You know, getting serious
about working out.

00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,676
And, you know, other stuff.

00:08:52,711 --> 00:08:56,815
Do you have any idea what might
have happened to him last night?

00:08:56,882 --> 00:09:00,252
No clue.

00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:02,321
When was the last time
that you saw Will?

00:09:02,387 --> 00:09:03,922
I saw him yesterday
at school, but that's it.

00:09:03,989 --> 00:09:05,324
Did you talk to him?

00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,126
No.

00:09:08,193 --> 00:09:10,662
Steve, you don't look so good.

00:09:10,729 --> 00:09:11,897
Are you feeling okay?

00:09:11,964 --> 00:09:13,398
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:20,505
Look, I know what you mean
about moving on to other things.

00:09:20,572 --> 00:09:22,274
When I was
your age,

00:09:22,341 --> 00:09:24,476
I couldn't get
there quick enough.

00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:28,981
I started to wish there was some
magic potion I could swallow

00:09:29,047 --> 00:09:30,682
to make myself older,

00:09:30,749 --> 00:09:32,584
cooler.

00:09:32,651 --> 00:09:34,586
Turned out
there was.

00:09:34,653 --> 00:09:35,821
The downside was,

00:09:35,888 --> 00:09:38,190
the next day,
I would feel awful.

00:09:38,257 --> 00:09:42,027
My mouth would be dry,
my head would be pounding

00:09:42,094 --> 00:09:43,428
and I could just
smell this...

00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:47,466
sweet sugary poison
seeping out of my pores.

00:09:50,903 --> 00:09:54,506
You're a tequila
man, huh, Steve?

00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:57,242
HODGES:
There were two different fibers
found on Will Sutter.

00:09:57,309 --> 00:09:59,545
This one's a standard trilobal
nylon polypropylene fiber.

00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:01,847
Widely used in
the manufacture

00:10:01,914 --> 00:10:04,716
of upholstered
furniture and bedding.

00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:06,618
This other fiber

00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:09,054
that Nick found
on the boy,

00:10:09,121 --> 00:10:10,856
is significantly more specific.

00:10:10,923 --> 00:10:13,191
It's an 80-20 rayon-nylon

00:10:13,258 --> 00:10:16,328
with an emerald hue, used,
as far as my research shows,

00:10:16,395 --> 00:10:18,363
exclusively to carpet

00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,566
1970's green Cadillacs.

00:10:20,632 --> 00:10:22,200
Not a popular seller.

00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:26,238
And in addition
to carpeting the interior,

00:10:26,305 --> 00:10:30,742
this same material was also used
to line the vehicle's trunk.

00:10:32,411 --> 00:10:34,846
You know, I read
something a while back.

00:10:34,913 --> 00:10:37,849
Said that the distance from home
that the average parent

00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,852
would allow their nine-year-old
to wander had shrunk to a tenth

00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:43,355
of what it was
when I was a kid.

00:10:43,422 --> 00:10:46,925
The world's a scarier place,
that's for sure.

00:10:46,992 --> 00:10:49,027
Oh, I was terrified back then.

00:10:49,094 --> 00:10:50,529
But a boy who
ventures out

00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:54,566
thinking the world <i>isn't</i>
a place to hide from,

00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:57,336
shouldn't be proven wrong.

00:10:59,338 --> 00:11:02,007
JOHNSON:
Will Sutter was exchanging
emails with someone

00:11:02,074 --> 00:11:03,875
screen-named "BlackChipCraig."

00:11:03,942 --> 00:11:06,011
Correspondence
was mostly about

00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:08,580
historic sites, ghost
towns, old mines.

00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:10,415
So, one day...

00:11:10,482 --> 00:11:12,084
(typing)

00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,920
BlackChip suggests they
go check out one of

00:11:14,987 --> 00:11:16,221
the old mines.

00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:17,322
Sounds like innocent geek fun.

00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:18,590
Except...

00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:21,526
a check of BlackChip's
static I.P. address

00:11:21,593 --> 00:11:22,694
and a quick Web search

00:11:22,761 --> 00:11:26,765
reveal him to be
Craig Lifford,

00:11:26,832 --> 00:11:29,401
40-year-old librarian
from Henderson.

00:11:29,468 --> 00:11:31,770
So a 40-year-old man
invites a 14-year-old boy

00:11:31,837 --> 00:11:32,938
to a secluded location.

00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:37,175
Could be more than just
innocent geek fun.

00:11:42,214 --> 00:11:44,316
Mr. Lifford.

00:11:44,383 --> 00:11:46,151
I see you're a history buff.

00:11:46,218 --> 00:11:50,155
You like old things--
vintage clothes, vintage cars.

00:11:50,222 --> 00:11:52,291
Well, I-I drive a hybrid, but...

00:11:52,357 --> 00:11:54,159
What is this about?

00:11:54,226 --> 00:11:56,662
Can you tell
me how you got

00:11:56,728 --> 00:11:58,764
the scratches on
your left wrist?

00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,165
Um, yeah.

00:12:00,232 --> 00:12:01,767
I have a new kitten.

00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,101
A new kitten?

00:12:03,168 --> 00:12:05,270
So you like some newer things,

00:12:05,337 --> 00:12:07,406
younger things.

00:12:07,472 --> 00:12:08,907
Should I have a lawyer here?

00:12:08,974 --> 00:12:10,275
Younger things
like, um,

00:12:10,342 --> 00:12:12,444
Will Sutter.

00:12:12,511 --> 00:12:13,946
The young man
you invited

00:12:14,012 --> 00:12:15,447
on a trip
to the Crowley Silver Mine.

00:12:15,514 --> 00:12:16,448
Remember him?

00:12:16,515 --> 00:12:18,984
Yeah?

00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:20,485
What the hell is this?

00:12:22,854 --> 00:12:24,156
No.

00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:26,225
No, no, no, no, no.
Yes.

00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,627
I-I work in a library.

00:12:28,694 --> 00:12:29,661
Among children.

00:12:29,728 --> 00:12:31,930
This has been my
life's passion.

00:12:31,997 --> 00:12:35,100
And if someone got in that
boy's ear and egged him into

00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:37,202
thinking that my
communication with him

00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:38,804
was something
that it was not...

00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,373
Tell me about what happened
between you and Will.

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,776
Um, we met online, um,

00:12:44,843 --> 00:12:47,479
in a forum
on a history Web site.

00:12:47,546 --> 00:12:50,415
His intellect,
his-his bearing--

00:12:50,482 --> 00:12:51,617
I assumed he was an adult.

00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:53,652
When I found out
that he was a young man...

00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:55,053
You continued to contact him.

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,756
About Nevada mining history!

00:12:57,823 --> 00:12:59,925
I suggested a few
historic sites

00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:02,094
that his parents
should take him to.

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,130
When he explained that he could
not, that that was not possible,

00:13:05,197 --> 00:13:07,532
I guess, yeah, I-I volunteered--

00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:10,068
forgetting
for one moment

00:13:10,135 --> 00:13:12,838
the implicit nefariousness
of an adult male

00:13:12,905 --> 00:13:16,541
taking a young boy's
academic curiosity seriously.

00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:18,277
But we didn't
go to the mine,

00:13:18,343 --> 00:13:19,378
I never met him.

00:13:19,444 --> 00:13:21,246
I didn't even know
his last name.

00:13:21,313 --> 00:13:23,382
I need to take
a sample of your DNA.

00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:25,784
Absolutely.

00:13:25,851 --> 00:13:28,220
Open your mouth, please.

00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:32,457
So is Will really claiming
that something happened?

00:13:32,524 --> 00:13:34,860
Mr. Lifford, Will is dead.

00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,026
Hey.
Hey.

00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,094
I got your text.

00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,529
What exactly am I
not gonna believe?

00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:50,830
(clears throat)

00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:52,565
That blood that was
under Will Sutter's nails

00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:54,367
was a hit to somebody
already in CODIS.

00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:57,370
One of Sara's old cases.

00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,005
And, before you look at this,
I promise you,

00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,106
I triple-checked this;
it's absolutely accurate.

00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,641
Okay.

00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,576
Okay.

00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,149
Simon Rose?

00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,117
I know. I don't know
what to tell you.

00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,319
It's impossible,
but it's true.

00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:16,056
Yeah, but he's been in
prison for the last...

00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:17,390
Two and a half years.

00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:20,060
Exactly.

00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:23,630
So how does his blood end up
under the nails of a dead kid?

00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:29,920
Since the morning
of January 1, 2006,

00:14:29,987 --> 00:14:33,858
when his wife Samantha was found
murdered in their home,

00:14:33,924 --> 00:14:37,895
I have stood by
my client Simon Rose.

00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:41,966
I was at his side
while he grieved over his loss,

00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:45,836
while he endured trial,
mistrial and the retrial

00:14:45,903 --> 00:14:48,439
that wrongfully
convicted him of a crime

00:14:48,506 --> 00:14:51,142
he did not commit.

00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,545
My belief in Simon Rose
has never faltered.

00:14:54,612 --> 00:14:58,616
And this morning's development
has vindicated my belief.

00:14:58,683 --> 00:15:02,253
The discovery of this blood
under the dead child's nails

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,922
is evidence that there is
someone in Las Vegas--

00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:09,026
a child murderer--
who has the same DNA profile

00:15:09,093 --> 00:15:12,964
as my incarcerated
but innocent client Simon Rose.

00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,933
Mr. Rose must be released

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,471
and the real murderer of both
Will Sutter and Samantha Rose

00:15:20,538 --> 00:15:22,340
brought to justice.

00:15:22,406 --> 00:15:23,574
Thank you.

00:15:23,641 --> 00:15:25,643
(reporters clamoring)

00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,036
SIDLE:
This is Simon Rose's blood
all over his wife.

00:15:31,103 --> 00:15:34,106
He choked her to death,
left her on the kitchen floor,

00:15:34,173 --> 00:15:35,607
and then claimed
to have been

00:15:35,674 --> 00:15:37,876
upstairs asleep
when she was attacked.

00:15:37,943 --> 00:15:40,812
Well, if he choked her,
then how did his blood

00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:41,813
wind up on her?

00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,182
SIDLE:
Well, because for once,

00:15:43,248 --> 00:15:45,050
she fought back.

00:15:45,117 --> 00:15:47,019
She broke his nose,
scratched his face.

00:15:47,085 --> 00:15:48,353
She couldn't stop him.

00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,355
And I guarantee that he took her

00:15:50,422 --> 00:15:52,024
halfway there
a dozen times before.

00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,725
STOKES:
And there were
police call-outs

00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:55,961
for domestic but no convictions.

00:15:56,028 --> 00:15:57,663
SIDLE:
The house told
the story.

00:15:57,729 --> 00:15:59,998
Punched-in walls
covered up with paintings.

00:16:00,065 --> 00:16:02,501
Broken vases
glued back together.

00:16:02,568 --> 00:16:04,603
He's rich and handsome,
he always got away with it,

00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,505
and he almost got away
with killing her, too.

00:16:06,572 --> 00:16:07,906
The mistrial?

00:16:07,973 --> 00:16:09,541
STOKES:
The prosecution had
a slam dunk going,

00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:10,843
but there was juror misconduct.

00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:11,844
Couple of weeks

00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,212
into the trial,
two jurors got

00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:14,880
their hands on
a bottle of gin

00:16:14,947 --> 00:16:16,281
and got tanked at lunch.

00:16:16,348 --> 00:16:18,083
SIDLE:
Other jurors said
that they saw one

00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,085
of Lynn Stecker's associates
bringing the booze to them.

00:16:20,152 --> 00:16:22,187
Yeah, but nobody can prove that.

00:16:22,254 --> 00:16:24,056
They have tried everything
to get this guy off,

00:16:24,122 --> 00:16:25,324
and they're still trying.

00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:28,026
By planting blood
under a dead kid's nails?

00:16:28,093 --> 00:16:29,862
I got to say,
I wouldn't put it past them.

00:16:29,928 --> 00:16:31,797
Okay.

00:16:31,864 --> 00:16:34,099
So, where did Rose's blood
come from?

00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,134
There were no preservatives
in the sample,

00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:37,569
which means it wasn't blood

00:16:37,636 --> 00:16:39,238
drawn from Rose and
stored in a blood bank.

00:16:39,304 --> 00:16:40,372
SIDLE:
If Rose did

00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:42,841
plan this,
he could have had blood drawn

00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:45,043
and stored without preservative
before going to prison.

00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,412
We're only dealing
with a minute amount.

00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:49,414
He could've snuck some
blood out of prison

00:16:49,481 --> 00:16:51,383
via mail or a
bribed guard.

00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,985
Be tough to track that one down.

00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:54,353
LANGSTON:
Well, if Rose

00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:57,222
cut himself to draw blood,
he might still have a wound.

00:16:57,289 --> 00:16:58,624
I'd like to examine him.

00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,093
As long as you're just looking
and not questioning,

00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,928
he doesn't have a right
to an attorney.

00:17:02,995 --> 00:17:04,062
So make that happen.

00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:06,431
Any other possible
sources for the blood?

00:17:06,498 --> 00:17:09,234
Samantha's dress
with Rose's blood on it.

00:17:09,301 --> 00:17:12,905
It's in permanent storage
at the Central Evidence Vault.

00:17:12,971 --> 00:17:15,207
All right, why don't the three
of you focus on those angles,

00:17:15,274 --> 00:17:17,609
Greg and I will
look at something else.

00:17:17,676 --> 00:17:19,411
A boy was killed.

00:17:19,478 --> 00:17:20,679
Simon Rose didn't do it.

00:17:20,746 --> 00:17:22,848
We need to find out who did.

00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,717
STECKER:
<i>Jim, at this firm,</i>

00:17:25,784 --> 00:17:28,320
we are the Lakers,
not the Globetrotters.

00:17:28,387 --> 00:17:29,888
We don't rely
on tricks.

00:17:29,955 --> 00:17:32,224
Oh, I've seen you
pass the ball behind your back

00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,959
quite a few times
over the years, Lynn.

00:17:34,026 --> 00:17:37,196
We've been pressing to get an
appeal for nearly two years.

00:17:37,262 --> 00:17:38,597
This morning's
discovery

00:17:38,664 --> 00:17:41,133
will merely serve as one
more piece to present

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,101
in the evidentiary
hearing--

00:17:43,168 --> 00:17:45,237
a chance to get real
justice for my client.

00:17:45,304 --> 00:17:46,572
This morning's discovery?

00:17:46,638 --> 00:17:48,106
We're talking about a dead boy.

00:17:48,173 --> 00:17:50,742
Don't give me justice for
your client; don't give me that.

00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:52,878
Samantha Rose was covered
in your client's blood.

00:17:52,945 --> 00:17:54,379
Funny how that works.

00:17:54,446 --> 00:17:58,817
I argue in trial that one of
Mr. Rose's many powerful enemies

00:17:58,884 --> 00:18:02,521
could easily have drugged
and wounded Mr. Rose,

00:18:02,588 --> 00:18:06,725
killed his wife and then planted
Mr. Rose's blood on his wife,

00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:08,327
and the prosecution, the media,

00:18:08,393 --> 00:18:10,128
treat that theory
like it was a joke.

00:18:10,195 --> 00:18:12,431
And yet, in this
new case, some vast

00:18:12,497 --> 00:18:17,202
blood-plant conspiracy is
the only viable explanation.

00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:19,605
Fitting that it should be
blood we're talking about,

00:18:19,671 --> 00:18:24,276
because isn't the stuff supposed
to smell kind of iron-y?

00:18:24,343 --> 00:18:25,744
That's cute, Lynn.

00:18:25,811 --> 00:18:28,146
But I'm telling you,
and I want you to hear this.

00:18:28,213 --> 00:18:31,149
If you know anything about this
dead boy or the manipulation

00:18:31,216 --> 00:18:35,888
of evidence, you have a lot more
to lose than just an appeal.

00:18:35,954 --> 00:18:38,323
Does it get old, Jim?

00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,959
Being sent as the
sheriff's messenger?

00:18:41,026 --> 00:18:42,194
Because when
you're ready

00:18:42,261 --> 00:18:45,898
to join a new team, you call me.

00:18:45,964 --> 00:18:48,000
Yeah, I know a lot of guys
who worked P.I. for you.

00:18:48,066 --> 00:18:50,002
Financially, it's great.

00:18:50,068 --> 00:18:52,671
Ethically, it's not so great.

00:18:52,738 --> 00:18:54,406
By the way,
your theory's flawed.

00:18:54,473 --> 00:18:56,041
Oh?
If someone wanted
to plant blood,

00:18:56,108 --> 00:18:58,610
they could do it
in any crime scene.

00:18:58,677 --> 00:19:02,614
What kind of a monster would
kill a kid to accomplish that?

00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:06,618
The same kind of monster

00:19:06,685 --> 00:19:08,587
who couldn't just divorce
Samantha Rose.

00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,694
ANDERSON:
Yeah, I-I remember you
on this case.

00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:19,665
W-When Rose got off that first
time round on that mistrial,

00:19:19,731 --> 00:19:21,433
must have driven you nuts.

00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,002
Drove me toward some
brochures about Costa Rica.

00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:26,271
You're smart
to get away like that.

00:19:26,338 --> 00:19:28,440
'Cause I remember,
when I was wearing that vest,

00:19:28,507 --> 00:19:30,442
I always told myself
I'd do the same.

00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:31,510
(sighs)

00:19:31,577 --> 00:19:33,645
Little fishing lodge,
Ely, Minnesota.

00:19:33,712 --> 00:19:35,147
(chuckles)

00:19:35,214 --> 00:19:37,049
Clear all of it out.

00:19:37,115 --> 00:19:39,885
But... just didn't
happen that way.

00:19:39,952 --> 00:19:41,887
You ever get out of
town now, George?

00:19:41,954 --> 00:19:43,255
Oh, nah.

00:19:43,322 --> 00:19:46,792
This-this here,
this is my castle.

00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:48,493
Let me see here.

00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,696
Yeah.

00:19:50,762 --> 00:19:51,930
Samantha Rose.

00:19:51,997 --> 00:19:54,633
When was the last time
this evidence was taken out

00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,636
by the defense
for independent examination?

00:19:57,703 --> 00:20:00,072
Let's see.

00:20:00,138 --> 00:20:01,740
November 4, 2006.

00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:03,075
Returned two days later.

00:20:03,141 --> 00:20:04,977
Right before the trial started.

00:20:05,043 --> 00:20:05,978
Sealed, signed

00:20:06,044 --> 00:20:07,980
and dated by yours truly.

00:20:09,648 --> 00:20:11,250
Here you go.
Thank you.

00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,045
Okay.

00:20:40,112 --> 00:20:41,446
Okay.

00:20:46,985 --> 00:20:48,987
LANGSTON:
<i>I'm going to need to see</i>

00:20:49,054 --> 00:20:51,023
Simon Rose's
visitation records.

00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:52,257
Yes, sir.

00:20:52,324 --> 00:20:54,359
And I'd also like to
speak with his cell mate.

00:20:54,426 --> 00:20:56,361
Well, his cell mate was
paroled three days ago.

00:20:56,428 --> 00:20:58,430
But I can get you
his P.O.'s contact info.

00:20:58,497 --> 00:20:59,932
All right.

00:20:59,998 --> 00:21:02,234
You Ray Langston?

00:21:02,301 --> 00:21:03,635
Yes.

00:21:04,736 --> 00:21:07,539
Nate Haskell says hello.

00:21:08,907 --> 00:21:10,108
Trustee!

00:21:10,175 --> 00:21:12,211
Get back to work!

00:21:16,949 --> 00:21:19,618
Step to the center
of the cell.

00:21:19,685 --> 00:21:22,287
LANGSTON:
Hello, Mr. Rose.

00:21:22,354 --> 00:21:24,356
My name is Ray Langston,
I work with the crime lab,

00:21:24,423 --> 00:21:25,691
and I'm here
to examine you today.

00:21:25,757 --> 00:21:28,527
Notice you have a cut there
on your neck.

00:21:28,594 --> 00:21:30,562
Can't help but breed
a few enemies in here.

00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:34,199
You just hope that they come
at you with spoons not knives.

00:21:34,266 --> 00:21:36,034
Breakfast,
couple days ago.

00:21:37,736 --> 00:21:41,073
Infirmary already shot photos,
documented the wound,

00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:42,074
wrote up a report.

00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,076
Mm-hmm.
Take your shirt off, please.

00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,646
(chuckles)

00:21:47,713 --> 00:21:51,617
I know how you guys
are feeling.

00:21:51,683 --> 00:21:55,387
Wake up one day
and everything's upside down.

00:21:55,454 --> 00:21:58,090
Suddenly, what you know to be
impossible is the only thing

00:21:58,156 --> 00:22:00,392
anyone else will believe,
because it's written in blood.

00:22:00,459 --> 00:22:02,628
Turn around.

00:22:03,662 --> 00:22:06,665
You know, when I was framed...

00:22:06,732 --> 00:22:09,635
I kept telling myself...

00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:12,771
if everything could be upended
in one morning like that,

00:22:12,838 --> 00:22:15,174
maybe someday
I'll wake up <i>another</i> day

00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,675
and everything gets flipped back

00:22:16,742 --> 00:22:19,111
the way it should be
just as suddenly.

00:22:19,178 --> 00:22:22,481
It took a thousand
mornings for that to
finally happen, Doctor.

00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:24,983
I wouldn't count on that
if I were you.

00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,252
Now shut up and drop your pants.

00:22:28,987 --> 00:22:31,156
What sort of
physical evidence
do you guys have?

00:22:31,223 --> 00:22:33,425
Anything, uh, interesting
from the dump site?

00:22:33,492 --> 00:22:35,727
Well, we're working on it.
Well, what about

00:22:35,794 --> 00:22:37,930
that pay phone where
the guy phoned it in?

00:22:37,996 --> 00:22:40,799
Sometimes you luck out
with a camera, fingerprints...

00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:42,901
Sorry.
(laughs)

00:22:42,968 --> 00:22:44,169
Listen to me.

00:22:44,236 --> 00:22:46,572
You still have the
instincts, huh, George?

00:22:47,739 --> 00:22:49,374
Take care of
yourself, okay?

00:22:49,441 --> 00:22:50,542
You, too.

00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:53,178
Good to see you.
You, too.

00:22:56,281 --> 00:22:57,583
George?

00:22:57,649 --> 00:22:58,884
Hmm?

00:22:58,951 --> 00:23:01,119
Whose Cadillac is this?

00:23:02,287 --> 00:23:04,489
That's mine-- uh, thing
barely runs anymore.

00:23:04,556 --> 00:23:05,557
I just...

00:23:05,624 --> 00:23:07,392
I just can't bring
myself to junk it.

00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:09,728
I'm gonna need you
to open the trunk for me...

00:23:09,795 --> 00:23:11,530
please.

00:23:20,138 --> 00:23:21,640
(sighs)

00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:29,548
Step over there
for me, please.

00:23:53,138 --> 00:23:54,173
What is that?

00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:56,642
That's a piece of
a candy bar wrapper.

00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:01,013
Same brand Will Sutter
was eating.

00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:07,219
I was the only one left
in the building last night.

00:24:07,285 --> 00:24:08,920
I was closing up
the vault...

00:24:08,987 --> 00:24:10,589
<i>a little after midnight.</i>

00:24:10,655 --> 00:24:12,224
<i>Turning off the lights.</i>

00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:19,676
Hey!

00:24:19,742 --> 00:24:21,544
(Will gasps, thuds to ground)

00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,854
<i>He was dead.</i>

00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:34,957
And I was afraid that
him being inside there
could jeopardize

00:24:35,024 --> 00:24:37,660
the evidence.
George, why didn't
you just call it in?

00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:40,129
Why didn't you just
let us know about it?

00:24:40,196 --> 00:24:41,964
That vault...

00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:44,200
is mine to protect.

00:24:44,267 --> 00:24:46,035
I keep the records.

00:24:46,102 --> 00:24:47,804
I watch over the evidence.

00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:50,473
If someone gets inside that's
not supposed to get inside...

00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:54,110
that intrusion
can compromise

00:24:54,177 --> 00:24:55,979
all the evidence,

00:24:56,045 --> 00:24:57,981
can threaten
every conviction.

00:24:58,047 --> 00:25:01,551
<i>I was not going</i>
<i>to let that happen.</i>

00:25:13,997 --> 00:25:16,432
I put all the Rose
evidence in a new box,

00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:19,268
I... signed and
redated the seals

00:25:19,335 --> 00:25:21,904
and placed it back
on its spot on the shelf.

00:25:21,971 --> 00:25:25,875
<i>I drove out to the vacant lot,</i>

00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:29,045
<i>cleaned out</i>
<i>the trunk afterwards...</i>

00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:32,081
<i>then called 911.</i>

00:25:32,148 --> 00:25:36,586
<i>I didn't want to leave him out</i>
<i>there any longer than I had to.</i>

00:25:36,653 --> 00:25:40,089
Well, it looks like this is
where Will Sutter bled out.

00:25:41,524 --> 00:25:43,726
It's consistent
with George's story.

00:25:44,894 --> 00:25:48,431
What was that kid doing in here?

00:26:00,043 --> 00:26:01,678
Take a look at this.

00:26:05,948 --> 00:26:08,184
"5-4-A-

00:26:08,251 --> 00:26:10,820
0-0-2-8-A."

00:26:10,887 --> 00:26:13,323
That's the evidence number
for the Rose case.

00:26:15,358 --> 00:26:17,627
With someone's algebra homework
on the back?

00:26:17,694 --> 00:26:19,729
I'm guessing... Will Sutter's.

00:26:20,897 --> 00:26:23,099
He knew what he
was looking for.
Yeah.

00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,834
How did he get
this number?

00:26:24,901 --> 00:26:27,403
Well, Rose's attorneys
would have it in
their case files.

00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,806
But anybody in law enforcement
can look that up

00:26:29,872 --> 00:26:30,940
on the C-Track
Database.

00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:32,542
So what are we saying, that...

00:26:32,608 --> 00:26:34,210
Simon Rose
didn't kill Will Sutter

00:26:34,277 --> 00:26:36,145
and have his blood
planted on him,

00:26:36,212 --> 00:26:38,114
but one of Rose's
associates sent Will

00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:39,582
in here to steal evidence?

00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:41,718
It looks good
for Rose's appeal

00:26:41,784 --> 00:26:45,154
if the prosecution lost
all the evidence.

00:26:45,221 --> 00:26:46,689
Yes, but why send a kid?

00:26:46,756 --> 00:26:49,125
He's 14 years old,
he's smart,

00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:50,493
he follows
instructions well,

00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,562
and if he gets caught,
he's a juvie--

00:26:52,628 --> 00:26:55,064
they just chalk it up to a...
youthful misadventure.

00:26:55,131 --> 00:26:56,265
That sounds right,

00:26:56,332 --> 00:26:58,501
but why Will Sutter?

00:26:58,568 --> 00:27:01,037
What is his connection
to Simon Rose?

00:27:03,806 --> 00:27:06,909
MAN (recorded):
<i>Whoever's looking</i>
<i>at Will Sutter's death,</i>

00:27:06,976 --> 00:27:09,112
<i>here's your tip: kid's dead,</i>

00:27:09,178 --> 00:27:10,713
boy's mother cashes in.

00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,515
You look at her bank account.

00:27:12,582 --> 00:27:13,816
Strange how that happens--

00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:15,652
he's dead and she's rich.

00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,520
(beep)
It came in

00:27:17,587 --> 00:27:20,089
as an anonymous tip.

00:27:20,156 --> 00:27:22,125
That's Will's dad.

00:27:22,191 --> 00:27:24,694
You told me that
he wasn't in your life.

00:27:24,761 --> 00:27:26,763
He isn't.

00:27:26,829 --> 00:27:30,600
You used to work
at the Shade Club.

00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:32,769
Simon Rose was
a silent partner

00:27:32,835 --> 00:27:35,071
in that club, spent
a lot of time there.

00:27:35,138 --> 00:27:37,373
I served him drinks.
And last week
you deposited

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,209
$10,000 into your bank account.

00:27:40,276 --> 00:27:43,012
Are you actually
accusing me of something.

00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:45,348
Your son broke in
to the police
evidence vault.

00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:47,383
He died while trying
to steal evidence

00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,052
from the Samantha Rose
murder case.

00:27:49,118 --> 00:27:50,787
Somebody sent him
on that mission.

00:27:50,853 --> 00:27:53,189
Now, between the money
and your affiliation

00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:55,792
with Simon Rose, it says
that that somebody was you.

00:27:55,858 --> 00:27:57,560
Look, that...

00:27:57,627 --> 00:27:59,095
The money?

00:27:59,162 --> 00:28:01,264
Will's dad came by last week.

00:28:01,331 --> 00:28:04,834
He'd hit some parlay
at the sports book: $50,000.

00:28:04,901 --> 00:28:07,570
He was drunk and generous--
gave me $10,000.

00:28:07,637 --> 00:28:09,472
I took the money.

00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:12,408
God knows he owes me twice
that in child support.

00:28:12,475 --> 00:28:14,010
Why is he calling us?

00:28:14,077 --> 00:28:15,211
He probably sobered up

00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:17,280
when he found out
what happened to Will

00:28:17,347 --> 00:28:20,950
and-and got pissed
that I'd still have the money...

00:28:21,017 --> 00:28:22,819
all to myself.

00:28:22,885 --> 00:28:24,687
What a deal for me, huh?

00:28:24,754 --> 00:28:27,290
Look, if you're
gonna arrest me,

00:28:27,357 --> 00:28:29,292
then-then do it.

00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,593
I'm not here to...

00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,762
Then get the hell
out of my house.

00:28:41,537 --> 00:28:45,375
I still can't figure out
how Will got inside the vault.

00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:49,278
On the night of his death, the
only thing that enters the vault

00:28:49,345 --> 00:28:52,081
are the evidence custodians...

00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:53,983
and the evidence.

00:28:56,953 --> 00:28:59,155
Wait, go back a little bit.

00:29:00,723 --> 00:29:01,824
That's good. Hold it.

00:29:01,891 --> 00:29:03,459
Bring up camera three.

00:29:03,526 --> 00:29:08,097
You know, I found some beige
microfibers in Will's hair.

00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:10,566
Hodges I.D.'d them
as the same type

00:29:10,633 --> 00:29:12,568
used in upholstered furniture.

00:29:12,635 --> 00:29:15,138
Hand me that evidence
entry list again, please.

00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,975
Thanks.

00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:25,415
"A woman walking her dog

Trojan horse.

00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:17,767
Trojan sofa.

LANGSTON:

00:30:38,121 --> 00:30:40,990
Will wasn't bleeding when
he came into the vault.

00:30:41,057 --> 00:30:43,226
Then where did
that blood come from?

00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:45,261
Right.

00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:50,733
Yeah. Smells
a little fishy.

00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,535
Does it?

00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:54,771
Yeah, it does.

00:30:54,837 --> 00:30:56,205
(sighs):
Hematrace.

00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:57,674
Yeah.

00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:23,366
Not human.

00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:24,767
Blood was just the bait.

00:31:24,834 --> 00:31:26,936
Smeared on the sofa
to draw attention.

00:31:27,003 --> 00:31:30,273
Sacrificial sea bass
to bless the Trojan voyage.

00:31:32,108 --> 00:31:35,144
Captain, you wanted to see me
about the Sutter case?

00:31:35,211 --> 00:31:37,413
Sit down.

00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,617
Will... was actually a
friend of my son, Mason.

00:31:41,684 --> 00:31:43,920
But CSI, they've
already talked to him.

00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:46,589
Two days ago, you looked up
the Samantha Rose case

00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:49,158
on the C-Track
database. Why?
No, I didn't.

00:31:49,225 --> 00:31:51,060
Your computer,

00:31:51,127 --> 00:31:53,830
4:00 p.m.
Two days ago, 4:00 p.m.,

00:31:53,896 --> 00:31:56,566
I would've been...
doing paperwork in my office.

00:31:56,632 --> 00:31:58,468
My son stopped by to hang out.

00:31:58,534 --> 00:31:59,569
Do some homework.

00:31:59,635 --> 00:32:00,903
Was Mason in your office?

00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,872
Yeah, he said his mom
was bugging him at home,

00:32:02,939 --> 00:32:04,273
so I said he
could hang out.

00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,309
Did he have access
to your computer?

00:32:06,376 --> 00:32:08,644
Well... for a minute,
yeah, I guess.

00:32:08,711 --> 00:32:11,581
Do you recognize
this sofa?

00:32:11,648 --> 00:32:13,249
This looks like
an old one

00:32:13,316 --> 00:32:15,151
we got out
in the garage.

00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:18,021
Is that blood?

00:32:23,226 --> 00:32:25,561
Mason?

00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:32,035
Get out here. Now.

00:32:33,803 --> 00:32:35,004
Mason?

00:32:35,071 --> 00:32:36,205
(sighs)

00:32:37,507 --> 00:32:39,175
(whispers):
My God!

00:32:39,242 --> 00:32:42,045
Control, this is
Captain Brass--
we have a 421
Oh, my God!

00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:43,379
with head wounds.
Easy, buddy.

00:32:43,446 --> 00:32:45,181
Send paramedics
to my location.

00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,718
Easy, Mason.

00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:11,143
Mason must have written down
the Rose evidence number

00:33:11,209 --> 00:33:12,644
and given it to Will.

00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:16,648
The kid might have miscalculated
more than his algebra.

00:33:38,036 --> 00:33:39,237
Found the weapon.

00:33:40,338 --> 00:33:41,339
(loud crack)

00:33:44,908 --> 00:33:47,678
With a bloody print
on the handle.

00:33:47,745 --> 00:33:50,814
You know, either this
assailant's sloppy
and disorganized,

00:33:50,881 --> 00:33:52,516
or really, really bold.

00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:55,452
SANDERS:
They didn't just
leave a print--

00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,254
they left a card.

00:33:57,321 --> 00:33:59,790
Lynn Stecker, Attorney at Law.

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,995
You're lucky

00:34:05,062 --> 00:34:07,364
this was on my route
between appointments, Jim.

00:34:07,431 --> 00:34:09,266
And whatever you want
to show me better be

00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:11,035
earth-shattering.

00:34:12,336 --> 00:34:14,538
BRASS:
Do you know him--
Officer Ward?

00:34:14,605 --> 00:34:17,308
He one of the guys
on your team?

00:34:17,374 --> 00:34:19,500
Never seen him before.

00:34:19,567 --> 00:34:21,302
I know you know
his son Mason.

00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:23,137
I know you know him,

00:34:23,204 --> 00:34:25,172
because we found your
business card in his bedroom.

00:34:26,207 --> 00:34:28,843
How dare you.

00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,444
He's going in and out
of consciousness.

00:34:30,511 --> 00:34:32,747
He hasn't said much-- yet.

00:34:34,181 --> 00:34:38,152
Yes, I met the kid
earlier today.

00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:43,291
<i>He tried to ambush me</i>
<i>in the firm's parking garage.</i>

00:34:43,357 --> 00:34:45,626
I say you on TV, and I
know you're trying to get

00:34:45,693 --> 00:34:48,729
Simon Rose out of jail,
because nobody knows how his
blood got on that dead kid,

00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:51,365
but I do know how.
Look, kid, I don't know
what you're doing here...

00:34:51,432 --> 00:34:53,434
Will snuck in the evidence vault
on a dare, all right?

00:34:53,501 --> 00:34:56,571
I know how he got in,
and I know how he got
Simon Rose's blood on him.

00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:59,473
And if you don't give me $5,000,
I'm gonna tell the cops.

00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,443
And Simon Rose will
stay in prison forever.

00:35:04,378 --> 00:35:07,014
He tried to extort you
and you didn't report it?

00:35:07,081 --> 00:35:09,250
I'm reporting it now.
You pay him,

00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:11,352
or do you know someone
who plays baseball?

00:35:11,419 --> 00:35:13,087
I gave him cab fare.

00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:14,755
Told him to get lost.

00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:16,591
How much?

00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:19,994
I don't know-- whatever
was in my pocket-- $200.

00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:21,696
That's like
cab fare to Reno.

00:35:21,762 --> 00:35:24,332
A bold and creative
kid like that--

00:35:24,398 --> 00:35:28,202
he reminded me of some
of my best interns.

00:35:28,269 --> 00:35:31,072
I gave him my card, told him
to call me in a few years.

00:35:31,138 --> 00:35:33,441
Let's let him make it
through the night first.

00:35:36,143 --> 00:35:37,979
Good luck on that appeal.

00:35:42,717 --> 00:35:46,153
So I heard that Mandy matched
the bloody print from the bat

00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,588
to another crime scene.

00:35:47,655 --> 00:35:50,191
Yeah, a swing shift case

00:35:50,258 --> 00:35:52,059
from the night before
Will Sutter died.

00:35:52,126 --> 00:35:54,395
LANGSTON:
Swing shift CSIs responded

00:35:54,462 --> 00:35:55,930
to an extinguished house fire

00:35:55,997 --> 00:35:58,566
at 494 Harris Street.

00:35:58,633 --> 00:36:01,602
Just northwest of Will Sutter
and Mason Ward's homes.

00:36:01,669 --> 00:36:02,937
LANGSTON:
The house had
stood vacant

00:36:03,004 --> 00:36:05,072
for the past three months,
but upon entering it,

00:36:05,139 --> 00:36:07,775
the CSIs discovered
the following items.

00:36:07,842 --> 00:36:09,210
Lighter--

00:36:10,578 --> 00:36:12,680
peace pipe...

00:36:12,747 --> 00:36:15,583
And the print on that bong
matches a print on the bat.

00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:19,186
So somebody parties
in a vacant house,

00:36:19,253 --> 00:36:20,488
sets it on fire

00:36:20,555 --> 00:36:23,591
and then three days later
attempts to kill Mason Ward?

00:36:23,658 --> 00:36:25,693
STOKES:
Yeah, in the meantime,

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,062
Mason helps Will sneak
into the evidence vault.

00:36:28,129 --> 00:36:30,298
There's got to be
a connection there.

00:36:30,364 --> 00:36:31,966
Rose.

00:36:32,033 --> 00:36:34,135
The burnt house
was at the corner

00:36:34,202 --> 00:36:36,671
of Harris Street
and Rose Street.

00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:38,439
Mason must have thought

00:36:38,506 --> 00:36:40,308
the address was on Rose Street.

00:36:40,374 --> 00:36:42,476
He wanted to retrieve
the evidence.

00:36:42,543 --> 00:36:45,880
<i>So Mason went</i>
<i>to his dad's office.</i>

00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:52,787
<i>He looked up Rose Street</i>
<i>in the C Track database,</i>

00:36:52,853 --> 00:36:54,789
<i>but mistakenly wrote down</i>
<i>the evidence number</i>

00:36:54,855 --> 00:36:57,558
<i>for Rose, Samantha.</i>

00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:59,827
But we don't have any evidence
of Will being in

00:36:59,894 --> 00:37:01,195
that burnt house.

00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:03,164
There was no THC
in his tox results.

00:37:03,231 --> 00:37:05,066
So he wasn't
partying.

00:37:05,132 --> 00:37:07,368
Why did he go in
to get the evidence?

00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:11,072
Maybe so he'd be invited
to the next party.

00:37:11,138 --> 00:37:14,642
This is a bottle of tequila.

00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:17,411
<i>We need to find Steve Reppling.</i>

00:37:17,478 --> 00:37:18,746
(knocking)

00:37:18,813 --> 00:37:20,581
BRASS:
<i>Las Vegas Police. Open up.</i>

00:37:20,648 --> 00:37:21,983
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Reppling,</i>

00:37:22,049 --> 00:37:24,685
we need to talk
to your son. Open up.

00:37:26,654 --> 00:37:28,923
Anything we can do?
BRASS:
There's nobody home.

00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,292
I'll be back with a unit--
we'll break down the door.

00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:32,827
Call me if you need me.

00:37:32,894 --> 00:37:33,828
Copy that, Captain.

00:37:33,895 --> 00:37:35,263
Dr. Ray.
Yes?

00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:37,365
Something's burning over there.

00:37:37,431 --> 00:37:39,333
Wouldn't that be
right around...

00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,302
The corner of Harris and Rose.

00:37:43,738 --> 00:37:45,940
Patrol, this is
Charlie-Zero-Four Sidle.

00:37:46,007 --> 00:37:48,142
402 fire, single-family
residence

00:37:48,209 --> 00:37:49,844
at the corner
of Harris and Rose Street.

00:37:57,084 --> 00:37:58,719
His bike's here.

00:38:00,621 --> 00:38:03,024
Steven, where are you?
(coughs)
Steve, we saw

00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,325
your bicycle outside.

00:38:04,392 --> 00:38:05,793
We know you're in here.

00:38:09,797 --> 00:38:11,432
There he is.

00:38:14,168 --> 00:38:15,636
Get him out of here.

00:38:16,871 --> 00:38:19,140
Dr. Ray, come on!

00:38:19,207 --> 00:38:20,975
I'll be right behind you.
Let's go!

00:38:31,953 --> 00:38:33,754
(distant sirens)

00:38:37,425 --> 00:38:39,560
Sara,

00:38:39,627 --> 00:38:43,631
we've got, uh,
apparent kindling for the blaze.

00:38:43,698 --> 00:38:45,766
SIDLE:
Lynn Stecker gave
Mason Ward $200.

00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:48,536
STEVE:
He deserved it.

00:38:48,603 --> 00:38:49,637
Excuse me?

00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:51,472
Mason deserved to die.

00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:53,641
<i>Mason started</i>
<i>everything that night.</i>

00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:57,078
He bought some weed
off a sophomore.

00:38:57,144 --> 00:38:59,614
Snuck a few bottles
from his dad.

00:39:01,682 --> 00:39:04,018
We'd been hanging out
in that house.

00:39:05,653 --> 00:39:06,721
Mason...
Wha...?

00:39:06,787 --> 00:39:07,922
What did you do?!

00:39:07,989 --> 00:39:09,657
I was just messing around
with the lighter,

00:39:09,724 --> 00:39:11,926
and then the whole...

00:39:11,993 --> 00:39:14,228
I'm gone.

00:39:17,832 --> 00:39:19,967
STEVE:
<i>We needed help.</i>

00:39:20,034 --> 00:39:22,503
<i>We knew Will</i>
<i>could figure something out.</i>

00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,638
(knocking)

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,943
So we went back over,
and the firemen had
put the fire out,

00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:31,178
but the CSIs were bringing out
all the stuff we left in there.

00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:33,781
What kind of stuff?

00:39:33,848 --> 00:39:36,450
Uh...

00:39:36,517 --> 00:39:38,819
Look, Will, you got to help us.

00:39:38,886 --> 00:39:40,488
Okay, that stuff is evidence.

00:39:40,555 --> 00:39:42,323
They're gonna trace it
and lock us up.

00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:44,959
You're the smart one--
you can come up with something.

00:39:45,026 --> 00:39:46,093
Just please.

00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,161
Please.
Come on, man.

00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:54,202
All right. Just let me
think for a minute.

00:39:55,503 --> 00:39:58,372
Will was smarter, braver,

00:39:58,439 --> 00:40:01,976
he was better than both of us.

00:40:02,043 --> 00:40:03,544
Two Benjamins.

00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:06,247
And I think I can get
even more out of the lady

00:40:06,314 --> 00:40:07,548
if I just...
Will died!

00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:09,483
Trying to save us.

00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:12,553
And what, you're just going
to make money off of that?

00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,655
All right, you can
have $50 of it, okay?

00:40:14,722 --> 00:40:16,791
You got change?

00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:22,363
<i>It was blood money,</i>

00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:24,498
<i>and I needed to see it burn.</i>

00:40:24,565 --> 00:40:26,901
<i>I didn't even care</i>
<i>if I went with it.</i>

00:40:26,968 --> 00:40:29,737
We let Will down.

00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:33,641
He's the one who deserved
to grow up.

00:41:01,135 --> 00:41:02,904

00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:35,102
WILL:
Oh, Mom, this is exactly
the one I wanted!

00:41:35,169 --> 00:41:36,470
SUTTER:
That the good one?

00:41:36,537 --> 00:41:38,573
Stop.

00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:41,275
This is the best
mom in the world.

00:41:41,342 --> 00:41:43,477
Ah, I love you, baby.
I love you, too.

00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:45,079
I have legal proof now.

00:41:45,146 --> 00:41:48,015
I am the best mom.

00:41:48,082 --> 00:41:49,784
WILL:
Wow.

00:42:03,731 --> 00:42:04,665
Check this out.

00:42:04,732 --> 00:42:06,500
We can pop wheelies
right here.

00:42:09,537 --> 00:42:11,906
All right.

00:42:11,973 --> 00:42:14,709
SUTTER:
Okay, guys, get in
for a group shot.

00:42:17,812 --> 00:42:19,274
Hi.
Hi.
