the fact that the

00:02:20,034 --> 00:02:22,269
Joseph Bigelow

00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:26,874

He was mutilated postmortem.

So, he died,
then someone cut into him

00:03:04,111 --> 00:03:05,913

So, did you and Ryan have a
relationship outside of work?

00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:12,935
We hooked up a few times.
Okay...

00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:15,704
But that... that was
a long time ago.

00:04:15,771 --> 00:04:17,573

What?

And there was no fight?
There was no struggle?

00:04:40,796 --> 00:04:41,997

What else?

00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:48,270

to get changed.

Okay, now just
wait right here.

Wincroft, yes.
Wincroft, right.

want to take your clothes, too.

00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:45,720
Uh, yeah, I'm the

00:05:45,787 --> 00:05:47,856
Neighborhood Watch captain.
Mm-hmm.

00:05:47,922 --> 00:05:49,724
Here, let me give you these.
No, no, no.

00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:50,892
Keep your shirt
on, captain.

00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,194

down at the station.

00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:29,998
Hey, somebody turned
the power off.

00:06:30,064 --> 00:06:32,934
I think I might've pulled
a partial off the main breaker.

00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:35,570
I'm turning the power
back on now.

00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,088
(camera shutter clicking)

00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:27,555
What is going on in here?

00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:28,990
Sorry I'm late.

00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:31,025
The freezer is
still on the fritz

00:07:31,092 --> 00:07:33,828
from when those ROC
goons tore up the place.

00:07:33,895 --> 00:07:35,063
It's not like we can
hang a "closed" sign

00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,397
on the door or anything.

00:07:36,464 --> 00:07:39,834
Hey, what kind of a house
has a sign-in board, man?

00:07:39,901 --> 00:07:41,102
I don't know.

00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,004
Where am I going?

00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:44,205
Oh, yeah.

00:07:44,272 --> 00:07:45,473
Yeah, sorry, Super Dave.

00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,542
Follow me.

00:07:51,212 --> 00:07:52,947
End of the hallway.

00:07:57,252 --> 00:07:59,954
I wonder if the bedroom
across the hall

00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,557
has a Webcam, too.

00:08:02,624 --> 00:08:05,360
Uh, I'm pretty
sure it does.

00:08:05,426 --> 00:08:07,162
How would you know
something like that?

00:08:07,228 --> 00:08:10,198
Nick, could I tell you
something personal?

00:08:10,265 --> 00:08:12,100
Maybe.

00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:14,302
Mrs. Phillips and I
occasionally enjoy

00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,205
a little... live stimulation

00:08:17,272 --> 00:08:19,607
to get us in the mood.

00:08:19,674 --> 00:08:20,708
What I'm saying is,

00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:23,511
uh, I'm intimately familiar

00:08:23,578 --> 00:08:25,146
with this
particular bedroom.

00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,148
I subscribe to the Web site.

00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:31,486
Well, try and maintain
your objectivity.

00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,122
Of course.

00:08:34,189 --> 00:08:36,357
(sighs)

00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,394
(camera shutter clicks)

00:08:41,963 --> 00:08:43,064
After you.

00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:45,266
David. I missed
your face.

00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,501
Aw, it's good
to see you.

00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:47,535
How's your wife?

00:08:47,602 --> 00:08:48,703
Good. Great. Why?

00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,938
What have you heard?

00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,576
The, um, back door is broken.

00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:56,811
It's probably the killer's
entrance and exit point.

00:08:56,878 --> 00:08:58,847
Looks like

00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,315
a men's size ten to 12.

00:09:00,381 --> 00:09:01,649
There's not much detail

00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:03,518
in these impressions.

00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:04,853
STOKES:
Not much?

00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,855
There's no detail.

00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,389
It's kind of weird,
actually.

00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:10,191
SIDLE: Maybe his shoes
had smooth soles.

00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,460
Or maybe he was doing
what we do.

00:09:12,527 --> 00:09:13,761
Which means
he planned this out.

00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:15,563
Great.

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,898
PHILLIPS:
Hey, guys.

00:09:16,965 --> 00:09:20,335
We've got a single laceration
here, left to right.

00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:24,005
Sliced the
carotid-jugular complex.

00:09:24,072 --> 00:09:26,541
This guy didn't
cut too deep.

00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,244
Just deep enough, actually.

00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,812
Efficient.

00:09:35,683 --> 00:09:37,085
ROBBINS:
<i>You're in a room,</i>

00:09:37,152 --> 00:09:38,253
<i>no doors, no windows.</i>

00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:40,388
<i>How do you get out?</i>

00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,158
Same way you got in.
(chuckles)

00:09:43,224 --> 00:09:44,859
Mm, I heard it this way.

00:09:44,926 --> 00:09:46,628
You're in a room with
no doors, no windows,

00:09:46,694 --> 00:09:47,996
there's a chain saw
and a table.

00:09:48,062 --> 00:09:50,031
How do you get out?

00:09:50,098 --> 00:09:51,766
I give up.

00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,102
You cut the table in half
with the chain saw.

00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:56,905
Two halves make a...?
"Hole."

00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,340
Out you go.
Brother.

00:09:59,407 --> 00:10:01,276
(laughing)

00:10:01,342 --> 00:10:04,913
Well, whoever did this
had to get in and out

00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,015
through a "hole."

00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:10,185
Well, think it was
a natural opening

00:10:10,251 --> 00:10:11,352
or did he make one?

00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:12,821
Either way,

00:10:12,887 --> 00:10:16,257
he had to use an endoscope
or a laparoscope.

00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:21,596
Well...

00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:25,066
here at the navel, that could
be a laparoscopic opening.

00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:26,501
Oh, yeah.
Mm-hmm.

00:10:30,071 --> 00:10:32,640
Hmm... Internally...

00:10:32,707 --> 00:10:37,145
the incision is open,
but externally, it's fused.

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,149
I don't see any sutures,

00:10:41,216 --> 00:10:45,653
so probably used
surgical glue.

00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,590
Whoever did this had to have
access to medical equipment.

00:10:48,656 --> 00:10:53,328
A doctor, med student,
surgical nurse.

00:10:53,394 --> 00:10:55,230
This isn't medicine.

00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:58,466
So, I hear you're the
Neighborhood Watch captain,

00:10:58,533 --> 00:10:59,901
is that right?

00:10:59,968 --> 00:11:01,136
Yeah.

00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,570
Well, since the
housing crash, you know,

00:11:02,637 --> 00:11:04,606
I've had to really
step up my patrols.

00:11:04,672 --> 00:11:07,475
You know, the banks nowadays--
they're selling,

00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,810
and renting out
these houses

00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,044
to anyone
who has a dime.

00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:11,279
Yeah, tell me about it.

00:11:11,346 --> 00:11:13,481
I got the same problem
in my neighborhood.

00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,484
Obviously, I could've
done a better job,

00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,019
being that someone was killed.

00:11:18,086 --> 00:11:19,053
Well, the girl wasn't.

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,488
She claims you saved her life.

00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,090
Well, I do my best.

00:11:22,157 --> 00:11:23,925
You know,
I pick up my flashlight

00:11:23,992 --> 00:11:25,360
the minute I come home
from work.

00:11:25,426 --> 00:11:26,694
Good man.

00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:28,763
Here, have a seat.
Oh, sure.

00:11:29,831 --> 00:11:31,366
So, tell me,

00:11:31,432 --> 00:11:34,469
how well did you know
Ryan Lester?

00:11:34,536 --> 00:11:36,538
Not really. Uh, I mean,

00:11:36,604 --> 00:11:38,339
I've seen him coming
and going.

00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,374
You know,
the Greene family

00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:41,276
owned that house before him--

00:11:41,342 --> 00:11:42,310
good friends--

00:11:42,377 --> 00:11:43,711
until they lost
their jobs

00:11:43,778 --> 00:11:45,647
and had to foreclose.

00:11:45,713 --> 00:11:47,315
Yeah, man,
everybody's feeling it.

00:11:47,382 --> 00:11:49,984
I'm so underwater in my house,
I should be wearing scuba gear

00:11:50,051 --> 00:11:51,786
in there, you
know what I mean?

00:11:51,853 --> 00:11:53,488
And neighborhoods aren't
neighborhoods anymore.

00:11:53,555 --> 00:11:54,989
Yeah.

00:11:55,056 --> 00:11:57,158
You know, we even got a peeper
in our neighborhood.

00:11:57,225 --> 00:11:58,626
Really?
Yeah.

00:11:58,693 --> 00:12:00,061
I mean,
I haven't seen him yet,

00:12:00,128 --> 00:12:02,330
but a few of the neighbors,
you know, that are left,

00:12:02,397 --> 00:12:04,365
they said they saw him
lurking around.

00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,401
Do you think, uh, anybody could
give me description?

00:12:06,468 --> 00:12:09,204
Well, the minute I get
something, you're my first call.

00:12:14,576 --> 00:12:17,912
Can you hold out your index
finger for me, please?

00:12:20,815 --> 00:12:22,951
(electronic blipping)

00:12:26,154 --> 00:12:29,724
Why is your print on the circuit
breaker at Ryan's house?

00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,726
Because I'm always
turning it back on.

00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:32,994
I told that cop earlier--

00:12:33,061 --> 00:12:34,262
the lights are always
going out.

00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:36,464
With all the Webcams,
curling irons,

00:12:36,531 --> 00:12:38,500
and blow-dryers,
the thing overloads.

00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:41,569
Can you hold out
your hands for me?

00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,771
Ryan's too cheap
to call an electrician.

00:12:43,838 --> 00:12:45,940
Did you touch the switch
last night?

00:12:46,007 --> 00:12:48,943
No. I don't do anything at night
except go to my car.

00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,845
There's a Peeping Tom
in the neighborhood.

00:12:50,912 --> 00:12:52,747
Have you seen him?
No.

00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,616
If I had, he'd have my Mace
in his face.

00:12:54,682 --> 00:12:56,885
Ryan said he's seen him
running from the house.

00:12:56,951 --> 00:12:59,220
Did Ryan happen to tell you
what this peeper looked like?

00:12:59,287 --> 00:13:02,056
You ever seen Marilyn Manson?

00:13:04,092 --> 00:13:05,860
SANDERS:
So, I've been scanning

00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:09,464
through this Webcam footage
for the past couple hours.

00:13:09,531 --> 00:13:11,399
It's a tough job.

00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:12,734
I manage.

00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:16,204
By the way, congrats on your
new gig, <i>supervisor.</i>

00:13:16,271 --> 00:13:17,539
You deserve it.

00:13:17,605 --> 00:13:19,507
Thanks, Greg.

00:13:19,574 --> 00:13:20,542
So, the, uh,

00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:22,811
Webcam girls turn off
their cameras

00:13:22,877 --> 00:13:24,179
at the end of their shift.

00:13:24,245 --> 00:13:27,582
So Marnie's camera was off
when Ryan bit it.

00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:29,584
Check this out.

00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:31,586
The curtains moved.

00:13:31,653 --> 00:13:32,921
I don't see
any hands.

00:13:32,987 --> 00:13:34,289
So, unless it was

00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,957
the AC, what is it?

00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,325
A ghost?

00:13:37,392 --> 00:13:40,161
Looks like there's something
behind the curtain,

00:13:40,228 --> 00:13:42,163
covering the windows.

00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,933
Probably to keep the light out.

00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:46,734
And anybody
from looking in.

00:13:46,801 --> 00:13:47,969
Not so sure
about that.

00:13:59,614 --> 00:14:02,117
Maybe it is a ghost.

00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,333
Ray.

00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,536
I remember how I know
this Bigelow guy.

00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:15,406
Years ago, I used to catch
this lounge act at the Riv.

00:14:15,472 --> 00:14:18,175
Joey-- "Joe Joe" Bigelow

00:14:18,242 --> 00:14:19,843
was always there.

00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,346
Sitting in the back
with his dirty tux on,

00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:24,515
playing air piano
to every tune.
Mm-hmm.

00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:26,350
The rumor is that he...

00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:28,385
he really did play
piano for Dean Martin.

00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:30,421
All the old-timers knew him.
Wow.

00:14:30,487 --> 00:14:33,590
Every day,
Joe Joe would walk

00:14:33,657 --> 00:14:36,427
from the Nugget
to the Mandalay

00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:38,429
and back again.

00:14:38,495 --> 00:14:40,431
Just looking for
some ivories

00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:41,932
to tickle, chasing
the dream.

00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:43,267
I guess he hadn't heard

00:14:43,334 --> 00:14:45,669
that live piano players went
the way of the dollar martini.

00:14:45,736 --> 00:14:49,173
Well, my point is,
is that he was on the streets,

00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:50,841
sleeping in different alleys,

00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:53,877
but always within spitting
distance of the Strip.

00:14:53,944 --> 00:14:56,714
Here's Las Vegas
Boulevard.

00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,716
Here's where
the body was found.
So?

00:14:58,782 --> 00:15:00,751
Joe Joe was

00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:02,019
a Strip snob.

00:15:02,086 --> 00:15:03,287
He wouldn't be caught dead west

00:15:03,354 --> 00:15:05,322
of the 15.
But he was caught dead there.

00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:06,890
Which suggests

00:15:06,957 --> 00:15:09,193
that that is where his surgeon

00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:11,695
works or lives.

00:15:11,762 --> 00:15:14,365
It also suggests that...

00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,900
he didn't know Joey.

00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:18,969
And that he selected him
at random.

00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:26,310
STOKES:
Now, looks like the peeper

00:15:26,377 --> 00:15:28,612
jimmied the window open.

00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:31,715
Cut himself a handy little flap
in the cardboard.

00:15:31,782 --> 00:15:33,717
Yeah, so he could see
the ladies in action.

00:15:33,784 --> 00:15:37,621
Closed...
never really noticed it.

00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,623
But open...

00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,358
I can see everything.

00:15:41,425 --> 00:15:45,929
There's some white trace
around the peephole.

00:15:45,996 --> 00:15:47,665
Kind of looks like makeup.

00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:49,166
Marnie Bennett said
that the peeper

00:15:49,233 --> 00:15:51,168
looked like Marilyn Manson.

00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:52,603
He wears a lot of makeup.

00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,004
I'll swab it.

00:15:57,007 --> 00:15:58,942
Hey, now what do you see?

00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:00,778
Nothing.

00:16:00,844 --> 00:16:03,647
He would've had to...

00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,317
move the curtains
to the side

00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,352
to enjoy the show.

00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:10,421
Which is what we
saw on the Webcam.

00:16:37,214 --> 00:16:38,515
Aha!

00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:41,051
The old wire hanger
through the peephole trick.

00:16:41,118 --> 00:16:42,252
(chuckling):
Yeah.

00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:43,687
And I have a pretty good idea

00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:46,256
where this old wire hanger
came from.

00:16:46,323 --> 00:16:48,759
Hey, Jim, this is Charlie-05.

00:16:48,826 --> 00:16:51,996
I need a warrant for Diamond
Star Cleaners, please, sir.

00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:56,066
(doorbell rings)

00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:58,335
This is the only household
in the development

00:16:58,402 --> 00:17:00,404
that uses Diamond Star Cleaners.

00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,374
Faith Mason?

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,042
Yes.
Ma'am,

00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,210
is there anyone else inside?

00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,945
What's this about?

00:17:08,012 --> 00:17:09,113
It's a warrant

00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,181
to search your house.

00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:15,552
Uh, my son is upstairs.

00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,587
I'll get him.
STOKES:
No, no.

00:17:16,654 --> 00:17:17,621
That's all right,
Mrs. Mason.

00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:19,289
We'll get him. What's his name?

00:17:19,356 --> 00:17:20,791
Craig.

00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:21,959
Craig. Okay.

00:17:22,026 --> 00:17:23,460
Come on, Sara.

00:17:25,596 --> 00:17:28,599
(black metal music
blasting in distance)

00:17:37,841 --> 00:17:39,843
(black metal music
grows louder)

00:17:41,211 --> 00:17:43,213
♪ ♪

00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:54,158
(knocking on door)
Craig!

00:17:54,224 --> 00:17:56,160
Las Vegas Police.

00:17:56,226 --> 00:17:57,494
(music blaring)

00:17:57,561 --> 00:17:59,496
Craig!

00:17:59,563 --> 00:18:02,666
Get up! Las Vegas Police!

00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:04,802
(loud music continues)

00:18:12,076 --> 00:18:14,011
(music stops)

00:18:14,078 --> 00:18:16,080
Craig!

00:18:17,481 --> 00:18:19,416
Craig, come on, buddy!

00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:21,485
Time to wake up!

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,089
Don't touch me.

00:18:25,155 --> 00:18:26,323
Las Vegas Police.

00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,958
We need you
to step outside.

00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:29,293
(scoffs)
You aren't the police.

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,461
Yeah, that's
all right,

00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,528
we brought one with us.

00:18:31,595 --> 00:18:32,863
Get your ass up.

00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:36,200
I said get up!

00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,077
Jeepers creepers.

00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:53,086
Does anybody
believe in sunlight

00:18:53,153 --> 00:18:55,622
in this neighborhood?

00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:09,803
(click, beep)

00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,085
Hey, Sara.

00:19:18,152 --> 00:19:19,553
Ten and a halves.

00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,623
Same size as the
show impressions
at the scene.

00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,093
I have seen this
mask before.

00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,929
Is it from a horror movie
or something?

00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:32,463
This job is a
horror movie.

00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,599
I don't even watch them anymore.

00:19:39,337 --> 00:19:41,606
Hey.

00:19:41,673 --> 00:19:44,008
I think we're in
the right place.

00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:06,531
(Sidle groans)

00:20:06,598 --> 00:20:07,865
(clears throat)

00:20:07,932 --> 00:20:09,033
What is it?

00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,803
It's, um...

00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,205
(groans)

00:20:14,272 --> 00:20:15,807
Satanists have been known

00:20:15,873 --> 00:20:17,075
to collect dead crows,

00:20:17,141 --> 00:20:18,710
to keep the smell of death
around them.

00:20:18,776 --> 00:20:20,345
How do you know that?
Grissom?

00:20:20,411 --> 00:20:21,679
Ozzy Osbourne.

00:20:21,746 --> 00:20:23,081
I loved Black Sabbath.

00:20:23,147 --> 00:20:24,482
For a summer.

00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:26,117
Well, in that case,
I guess we're lucky

00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:29,387
the head's still on it.

00:20:31,422 --> 00:20:33,191
Sara.

00:20:33,258 --> 00:20:36,361
Did Ozzy, uh, say anything
about collecting dead bodies?

00:20:46,237 --> 00:20:48,172
(chuckles)

00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:50,174
What?

00:20:50,241 --> 00:20:52,243
(sighs)

00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:54,579
Scary masks.

00:20:54,646 --> 00:20:55,613
Rubber hands.

00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,615
Arts and crafts.

00:20:57,682 --> 00:21:00,385
What's this kid's name again?

00:21:00,451 --> 00:21:02,887
Craig Mason.

00:21:02,954 --> 00:21:05,890
As in Judge Mason?

00:21:05,957 --> 00:21:07,425
Aka Paul Millander.

00:21:07,492 --> 00:21:08,826
WILLOWS:
<i>You're never going to believe</i>

00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,329
<i>who Judge Mason's</i>
<i>fingerprints match.</i>

00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:12,830
GRISSOM:
<i>His real name</i>
<i>is Paul Millander.</i>

00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,667
<i>He's a serial killer</i>
 <i>with a split personality.</i>

00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,703
This is our best-seller-- even
used my own hand for the mold.

00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:22,173
MRS. MASON:
<i>I'd like you to meet</i>
<i>our son Craig.</i>

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,143
You'll be safe now.

00:21:26,344 --> 00:21:30,014
Craig Mason is Paul Millander's
adopted son.

00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:31,716
Son of Millander.

00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,293
Nature or nurture--
you choose.

00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:46,162
Either way,
this kid Mason's a freak.

00:21:46,229 --> 00:21:47,597
And not very
cooperative.

00:21:47,664 --> 00:21:50,566
The only thing he hates
worse than cops is CSIs.

00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:53,102
He even mentioned Grissom's name
a few times.

00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:55,438
Well, then I won't mention
that I'm Mrs. Grissom.

00:21:55,505 --> 00:21:56,439
Oh, you took his last name?

00:21:56,506 --> 00:21:57,607
Uh, no.

00:21:57,674 --> 00:21:59,676
Uh, turns out we do not have
a murder weapon.

00:21:59,742 --> 00:22:01,811
According to Wendy, the blood
on Craig's straightedge

00:22:01,878 --> 00:22:03,379
does not belong
to Ryan Lester.

00:22:03,446 --> 00:22:05,481
Well, maybe there was
more than one knife.

00:22:05,548 --> 00:22:06,883
I'll call Canine,

00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,318
have them meet them
at the scene.

00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,553
Thank you.

00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,589
My son didn't do
anything wrong.

00:22:12,655 --> 00:22:16,125
Mrs. Mason, I am only here
to collect evidence.

00:22:16,192 --> 00:22:18,127
I married a judge.

00:22:18,194 --> 00:22:21,264
Craig's father was a judge,
not a serial killer.

00:22:21,331 --> 00:22:22,999
This is not about
Craig's father.

00:22:23,066 --> 00:22:24,634
You know damn well it is.

00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:27,604
Craig shouldn't be punished
for Paul Millander's sins.

00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,906
I can assure you
he will only be punished

00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,407
if he has broken the law.

00:22:31,474 --> 00:22:33,476
Now, if you'll please
excuse me.

00:22:35,912 --> 00:22:38,147
Craig.

00:22:38,214 --> 00:22:39,782
Hi.

00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:43,953
I need your clothes
and a DNA sample.

00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,789
Look, don't force me to
do this the hard way.

00:22:46,856 --> 00:22:49,359
Can you sit
up, please?

00:22:51,394 --> 00:22:54,197
I know you've had a
hard childhood, and

00:22:54,264 --> 00:22:55,598
you've probably been scrutinized
at every school

00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,367
that you've been to,
and to you, I'm just

00:22:57,433 --> 00:22:58,468
another one of those
people who wants

00:22:58,534 --> 00:22:59,602
to put you under a
microscope, but...

00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,770
Just shut up

00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,839
and take my DNA.

00:23:12,248 --> 00:23:14,183
(sniffing)

00:23:27,196 --> 00:23:29,599
(dog whining, panting)

00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:31,734
(dog barks)

00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:33,569
STOKES: Where's he goin'?
This is the Mason house.

00:23:33,636 --> 00:23:34,637
I don't know!

00:23:52,188 --> 00:23:54,724
Get that dog back.
Get that dog back.

00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:57,126
Clear it, Mitch.

00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:06,152
His throat's slit
just like Ryan Lester's.

00:24:06,219 --> 00:24:08,388
SANDERS:
Dried blood, fixed lividity.

00:24:08,454 --> 00:24:10,356
Been here
at least 24 hours.

00:24:10,423 --> 00:24:11,991
MITCH:
Code four.

00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:13,259
You're going to want
to see this.

00:24:21,067 --> 00:24:23,536
Whoa-ho-ho!

00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:32,227
The plot thickens.

00:24:32,293 --> 00:24:35,030
Porn house,
drug house.

00:24:35,096 --> 00:24:36,731
Millander house
in between.

00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:39,534
They must throw one hell
of a block party.

00:24:41,436 --> 00:24:43,371
ROBBINS:
<i>A drug dealer</i>

00:24:43,438 --> 00:24:45,206
named Kilo, 25.

00:24:45,273 --> 00:24:47,475
I compared his neck wound
to Ryan Lester's.

00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:49,344
They're virtually identical.

00:24:49,411 --> 00:24:52,047
Both incised wounds
about an inch deep.

00:24:52,113 --> 00:24:54,182
Result of an extremely

00:24:54,249 --> 00:24:55,617
sharp, thin blade.

00:24:55,684 --> 00:24:56,951
But there's something additional

00:24:57,018 --> 00:24:58,420
with Mr. Kilo.

00:24:58,486 --> 00:25:01,890
Parallel abrasions
on both sides of the incision.

00:25:01,956 --> 00:25:04,192
Murder weapon was probably

00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:06,194
a utility knife
or box cutter.

00:25:06,261 --> 00:25:08,697
STOKES:
If the same weapon was used
on both victims,

00:25:08,763 --> 00:25:10,532
then why didn't we find
similar abrasions

00:25:10,598 --> 00:25:12,367
on Ryan Lester here?

00:25:12,434 --> 00:25:14,002
Might be a matter of pressure.

00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:17,138
Killer pressed harder
on Mr. Kilo.

00:25:17,205 --> 00:25:18,873
<i>He jammed the body</i>
<i>of the weapon</i>

00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,443
<i>right up against his neck.</i>

00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:23,745
T.O.D.'s?

00:25:23,812 --> 00:25:26,381
Both men were killed
between 10:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m.

00:25:26,448 --> 00:25:28,783
I can't tell you
who was first.

00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,086
Well, either way,

00:25:31,152 --> 00:25:33,621
we've got ourselves
a spree killer.

00:25:33,688 --> 00:25:36,725
ANCHORWOMAN:
This afternoon while
investigators were at the scene

00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:39,327
of the Ryan Lester homicide,
a police dog lead them

00:25:39,394 --> 00:25:42,230
to a second murder victim
located several houses down.

00:25:42,297 --> 00:25:44,165
Police have a suspect
in custody

00:25:44,232 --> 00:25:46,601
related to the murder
of Ryan Lester,

00:25:46,668 --> 00:25:49,504
who was attacked and killed
in his own home last night.

00:25:49,571 --> 00:25:51,740
Officials have not confirmed
a connection

00:25:51,806 --> 00:25:53,742
between the two murders.

00:25:53,808 --> 00:25:56,344
(door opening)
And police are asking
the public to please

00:25:56,411 --> 00:25:58,680
contact the Las Vegas
Police Department with any...

00:25:58,747 --> 00:26:00,015
Where are you
taking him?

00:26:00,081 --> 00:26:01,182
CCDC.

00:26:01,249 --> 00:26:02,817
Uh, we have evidence
placing your son

00:26:02,884 --> 00:26:04,452
at the scene
of the first murder.

00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,820
For the moment,
we're holding him

00:26:05,887 --> 00:26:07,422
under NRS-200.603.

00:26:07,489 --> 00:26:09,357
It's peeping.

00:26:10,392 --> 00:26:12,327
Did you really do that?

00:26:12,394 --> 00:26:15,363
Did you look
into other people's homes?

00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,965
Yeah.

00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,235
But I didn't kill anyone.

00:26:20,301 --> 00:26:22,170
I was just looking
at the girls.

00:26:22,237 --> 00:26:23,705
That's why they do it.

00:26:23,772 --> 00:26:26,041
I just wasn't paying.

00:26:29,411 --> 00:26:31,012
Mom, just bail me out, okay?

00:26:32,714 --> 00:26:33,815
Mom?

00:26:33,882 --> 00:26:35,316
Mom, you-you believe me,
don't you?

00:26:35,383 --> 00:26:36,618
Mom!

00:26:36,685 --> 00:26:39,454
Mom! Mom!

00:26:39,521 --> 00:26:43,992
Mom, I didn't do it!
Your son's going
to need a lawyer.

00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:46,628
(stifled sobbing)

00:26:55,337 --> 00:26:57,272
(door opening)

00:26:57,339 --> 00:26:59,574
I'm learning
when I can't find you,

00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:01,409
I should look down here.

00:27:01,476 --> 00:27:02,977
This is very
difficult.

00:27:03,044 --> 00:27:05,747
It's like attempting to tie

00:27:05,814 --> 00:27:08,416
a cherry stem
into a knot

00:27:08,483 --> 00:27:10,618
with your tongue.

00:27:10,685 --> 00:27:12,887
I can do that...
after a few drinks.

00:27:12,954 --> 00:27:15,156
(sighing)

00:27:15,223 --> 00:27:18,834
Our Dr. Jekyll has some
remarkable surgical skills.

00:27:18,901 --> 00:27:20,403
Dr. Jekyll?

00:27:20,469 --> 00:27:21,671
Whoever mutilated Mr. Bigelow.

00:27:21,737 --> 00:27:23,873
What remarkable surgeon

00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,641
steals a dead man
off the streets,

00:27:25,708 --> 00:27:28,210
practices on him,
and then dumps him in an alley?

00:27:28,277 --> 00:27:30,246
No surgeon I ever met.

00:27:30,313 --> 00:27:32,081
You did get permission
from the family

00:27:32,148 --> 00:27:33,649
to use this body for research?

00:27:33,716 --> 00:27:35,451
Not necessary.
Take a look.

00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:41,591
(laughs)

00:27:41,657 --> 00:27:43,159
I'm hosting a luau later.

00:27:43,226 --> 00:27:44,760
Well, don't invite Sara.

00:27:44,827 --> 00:27:47,163
And before you put on
your grass skirt

00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,332
and put pinkie on a spit,
I need you in Layout.

00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:52,401
Nick and Sara need some
fresh eyes on the Mason case.

00:27:52,468 --> 00:27:55,538
Okay... Come on,
come on, come on...

00:27:56,739 --> 00:27:58,908
(sighs)

00:27:58,975 --> 00:28:00,343
DNA has come up empty.

00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:01,911
There's no sign of either victim

00:28:01,978 --> 00:28:03,779
on Craig Mason's
clothes or shoes.

00:28:03,846 --> 00:28:05,114
I did notice some scars

00:28:05,181 --> 00:28:06,782
on his arms.
I think he was using

00:28:06,849 --> 00:28:08,618
the straight razor
to cut himself.

00:28:08,684 --> 00:28:10,886
STOKES:
Hodges analyzed the white trace

00:28:10,953 --> 00:28:13,422
that was found around the
peephole at the Webcam house,

00:28:13,489 --> 00:28:15,958
and it was a match
to Craig's corpse makeup.

00:28:16,025 --> 00:28:17,360
So we can put him
at the house,

00:28:17,426 --> 00:28:18,527
but not in the house.

00:28:18,594 --> 00:28:19,929
And we have nothing
so far

00:28:19,996 --> 00:28:21,697
that puts him
at the drug dealer's house.

00:28:21,764 --> 00:28:23,199
We keep looking.

00:28:23,266 --> 00:28:25,034
His mother hasn't
bailed him out yet.

00:28:25,101 --> 00:28:26,602
I don't think
she's going to.

00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:27,803
She had that look
in her eye

00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:28,971
that maybe he did it.

00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:31,307
It is classic escalation.

00:28:31,374 --> 00:28:32,742
From peeper
to murderer.

00:28:32,808 --> 00:28:34,443
He's a teenager.

00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:37,480
There were attractive women
coming in and out of that house

00:28:37,546 --> 00:28:38,781
all the time.

00:28:38,848 --> 00:28:40,316
It doesn't seem that
sinister to me. Besides,

00:28:40,383 --> 00:28:42,418
he didn't murder the person
that he was peeping.

00:28:42,485 --> 00:28:44,320
STOKES:
Maybe he saw Ryan Lester
as competition.

00:28:44,387 --> 00:28:46,289
You know, Lester was intimate
with Marnie.

00:28:46,355 --> 00:28:48,391
Craig could only watch her
from a distance.

00:28:48,457 --> 00:28:50,293
All right, say that's true.
Then what about

00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,727
the second victim,
Cliff Kilo?

00:28:51,794 --> 00:28:53,796
WILLOWS:
Extensive criminal record.

00:28:53,863 --> 00:28:55,331
It's mostly drug related.

00:28:55,398 --> 00:28:57,400
Why would Mason murder
a drug dealer?

00:28:57,466 --> 00:28:59,802
Did he have drugs
in his system?
No.

00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:01,237
Tox panel came back clean.

00:29:01,304 --> 00:29:02,805
And it wasn't about money.

00:29:02,872 --> 00:29:05,274
I mean, there was cash
all over the house.

00:29:05,341 --> 00:29:07,610
All right, if...

00:29:07,677 --> 00:29:11,781
Craig wasn't a ghoul,

00:29:11,847 --> 00:29:15,017
and if his father hadn't come
after Grissom,

00:29:15,084 --> 00:29:17,386
would you be considering him
at all?

00:29:22,425 --> 00:29:23,960
And whose hand is this?

00:29:24,026 --> 00:29:26,262
It's Millander's.
Used his own hand to make

00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:27,430
the mold.

00:29:27,496 --> 00:29:28,965
All right,
did Paul Millander's thumbs

00:29:29,031 --> 00:29:31,601
and forefingers have
a congenital malformation?

00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:33,936
No.

00:29:34,003 --> 00:29:37,206
Then this isn't his hand.

00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:48,627
(latch clicks, door slides)

00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,099
Hello, Craig.

00:29:54,165 --> 00:29:55,834
My name is Ray.

00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,404
I work at the
crime lab.

00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:01,873
Can I see your hands?

00:30:02,907 --> 00:30:04,909
Please?

00:30:08,513 --> 00:30:10,849
Hmm.

00:30:10,915 --> 00:30:13,451
Good. Just a moment.

00:30:13,518 --> 00:30:15,920
Let me just
document them.

00:30:15,987 --> 00:30:16,955
(camera shutter clicks)

00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:18,857
I'm gonna need your help

00:30:18,923 --> 00:30:20,358
with a little
experiment.

00:30:20,425 --> 00:30:22,193
Why would I help
the crime lab?

00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,596
Who said
you'd be helping the crime lab?

00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:29,968
You're going to help yourself.

00:30:37,509 --> 00:30:38,543
(click)

00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:48,086
See, Craig, you and I
have something in common.

00:30:48,153 --> 00:30:51,456
We both have fathers
who killed people.

00:30:51,523 --> 00:30:52,891
Your father was a serial killer?

00:30:52,958 --> 00:30:55,327
No. He was a soldier
in the Korean War.

00:30:57,462 --> 00:30:59,965
He even got a Bronze
Star for his work.

00:31:00,031 --> 00:31:02,033
That's different.
No, it's not.

00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,803
See, after the war was over,
my father continued to fight.

00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:07,806
Every once in a while,
he would go out to a bar.

00:31:07,872 --> 00:31:10,041
Not so much to drink,
but to pick fights?

00:31:10,108 --> 00:31:13,078
I remember one day, he came
home, he was very excited.

00:31:13,144 --> 00:31:15,313
Had a black eye
and a fat lip.

00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,916
Was bragging about
how he had knocked somebody out.

00:31:17,983 --> 00:31:19,818
Said he hit the man so hard,

00:31:19,884 --> 00:31:22,220
the paramedics had
to peel him off the floor.

00:31:22,287 --> 00:31:24,689
Said it was the most fun
he'd ever had.

00:31:32,964 --> 00:31:34,399
(Langston groans)

00:31:34,466 --> 00:31:37,168
Why don't you come over here
and cut his throat, Craig?

00:31:37,235 --> 00:31:38,570
What?

00:31:38,637 --> 00:31:40,238
Come on, cut his throat.

00:31:40,305 --> 00:31:42,307
Don't hold back.

00:31:43,341 --> 00:31:45,277
Show me how much

00:31:45,343 --> 00:31:47,279
you're <i>not</i> like your father.

00:31:57,055 --> 00:31:58,323
Hey.

00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,925
Hey. We got a warrant for
Craig Mason's medical records.

00:32:00,992 --> 00:32:03,595
You were right. He was born
with a congenital malformation.

00:32:03,662 --> 00:32:05,764
He made a mold of his own hand?
Like father,

00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,132
like son.

00:32:07,198 --> 00:32:08,700
Well, both neck wounds
were uniform.

00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:09,868
Left to right,
slightly downward.

00:32:09,935 --> 00:32:11,002
Take a look

00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:12,237
at Jell-O Man.

00:32:12,304 --> 00:32:14,706
SIDLE:
Cut's uneven. Shallow.

00:32:14,773 --> 00:32:16,875
It's almost
vertical.
Huh.

00:32:16,942 --> 00:32:18,476
He could have done that
on purpose.

00:32:18,543 --> 00:32:20,378
LANGSTON:
Well, his anomaly makes it
virtually impossible for him

00:32:20,445 --> 00:32:21,680
to hold a box cutter properly.

00:32:21,746 --> 00:32:22,847
I watched him.

00:32:22,914 --> 00:32:24,683
That was the
best he could do.

00:32:24,749 --> 00:32:27,218
Okay. So,
if Craig didn't kill them,

00:32:27,285 --> 00:32:29,454
who did?

00:32:29,521 --> 00:32:31,323

You know,
I just had to make

00:32:38,129 --> 00:32:39,898
a little pit stop
at the crime lab.

00:32:39,965 --> 00:32:42,300
Yeah.

00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:45,503
Yeah, all right.
Thank you.

00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,839

these things are to tie?

00:32:59,751 --> 00:33:01,786

00:33:07,525 --> 00:33:09,628
Oh, right.

00:33:09,694 --> 00:33:12,197
When we found the body,
he wasn't wearing a tie.

00:33:12,263 --> 00:33:14,132
There's no bow tie on the body,

00:33:14,199 --> 00:33:15,800
not anywhere on the body.

00:33:22,707 --> 00:33:23,642
So what?

00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:24,743
Someone took it?

00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:26,478
His bow tie's missing.

00:33:26,544 --> 00:33:28,346
His intestines are tied
into a bow.

00:33:28,413 --> 00:33:30,482
That can't be a coincidence.

00:33:30,548 --> 00:33:33,518
I think Dr. Jekyll
took it as a souvenir.

the last time
we're going to see Dr. Jekyll.

00:33:42,694 --> 00:33:44,696

he's not gonna be content

00:33:44,763 --> 00:33:46,598

I lost both my father...

00:40:59,798 --> 00:41:04,669
...and my idol.

00:41:04,736 --> 00:41:07,806
Making masks and rubber hands

00:41:07,872 --> 00:41:10,742
is my way of keeping
the connection alive.

00:41:12,978 --> 00:41:16,114
Is my mom here to pick me up?

00:41:17,148 --> 00:41:19,618
I can give you a lift.

00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:27,158
Let's go.

00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,081
♪ ♪

00:41:58,423 --> 00:42:00,692
LANGSTON:
See, Craig, you and I have
something in common.

00:42:00,759 --> 00:42:03,161
We both have fathers
who killed people.

00:42:03,228 --> 00:42:04,996
CRAIG:
Your father was
a serial killer?

00:42:05,063 --> 00:42:07,732
No, he was a soldier
in the Korean War.

00:42:07,799 --> 00:42:10,168
He even got a Bronze Star
for his work.

00:42:10,235 --> 00:42:11,336
That's different.

00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,637
No, it's not.

00:42:12,704 --> 00:42:14,906
See, after the war was over,
my father continued to fight.

00:42:14,973 --> 00:42:17,309
Every once in a while,
he would go out to a bar.

00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:20,378
<i>Not so much to drink</i>
<i>but to pick fights.</i>

00:42:20,445 --> 00:42:23,181
<i>I remember one day he came</i>
<i>home, he was very excited.</i>

00:42:23,248 --> 00:42:25,717
<i>Had a black eye</i>
<i>and a fat lip.</i>

00:42:25,784 --> 00:42:28,486
<i>He was bragging about how</i>
<i>he had knocked somebody out.</i>

00:42:28,553 --> 00:42:30,422
He said he hit
the man so hard

00:42:30,488 --> 00:42:32,991
the paramedics had to
peel him off the floor.

00:42:33,058 --> 00:42:36,061
Said it was the most fun
he'd ever had.

00:42:43,234 --> 00:42:45,303
<i>Why don't you come over here</i>
<i>and cut his throat, Craig?</i>

00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:46,605
CRAIG:
<i>What?</i>

00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:48,239
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>cut his throat.</i>

00:42:50,976 --> 00:42:54,579
<i>Show me how much</i>
<i>you're</i> not <i>like your father.</i>
