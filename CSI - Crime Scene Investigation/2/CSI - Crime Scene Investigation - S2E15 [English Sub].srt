00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,936
That one's not ours.

00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:28,937
You sure?

00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:32,740
I authorize all cadavers
and associated research.

00:01:32,807 --> 00:01:33,942
He's not ours.

00:01:36,611 --> 00:01:39,280
BRASS:
People donate their
body to science

00:01:39,347 --> 00:01:41,115
end up submerged in a pond?

00:01:41,182 --> 00:01:42,317
Crammed in a car?

00:01:42,383 --> 00:01:45,687
Body farm; creepy.

00:01:45,753 --> 00:01:47,455
GRISSOM:
A body farm
is not creepy.

00:01:47,522 --> 00:01:50,291
It's a controlled study of
situational decomposition.

00:01:50,358 --> 00:01:51,893
All in all,
a very healthy place.

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,729
Tell that to slim
hanging from the tree.

00:01:54,796 --> 00:01:57,765
Whoever placed our victim here
knew that the body farm existed.

00:01:57,832 --> 00:01:59,133
What they didn't know
is each body

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,635
is tracked by
a bunch of scientists.

00:02:00,702 --> 00:02:03,004
Can't just slip a card
into the deck.

00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:05,917
Well, he's not in rigor.
TSD is under six hours.

00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,291
I'll move him

00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:07,959
as soon as
your finished.

00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:08,610
Any I.D.?

00:02:08,676 --> 00:02:09,811
None.

00:02:09,877 --> 00:02:11,879
Okay, I'm going
to move him.

00:02:17,685 --> 00:02:19,420
Gunshot wound
to the chest.

00:02:19,487 --> 00:02:21,289
WILLOWS:
Well, look.

00:02:21,356 --> 00:02:23,324
One of your friends.

00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:35,470
It's a carpet beetle.

00:02:35,536 --> 00:02:37,138
It shouldn't be here.

00:02:37,205 --> 00:02:39,540
Vic seem more like a hardwood
floors kind of guy to you?

00:02:39,607 --> 00:02:42,644
Carpet beetles are the last
to arrive at a corpse--

00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,379
when it's almost a skeleton.

00:02:44,445 --> 00:02:46,381
I mean, this guy's still fresh.

00:02:53,888 --> 00:02:56,324
David, get this body
out of here now!

00:02:56,391 --> 00:02:58,226

Yeah.

00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:36,667
I've always wanted
to go there.

00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:37,668
What was it like?

00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,534
Quiet.

00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:41,375
I hear Grissom
goes there all the time.

00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,477
Like even on his nights off.

00:03:43,544 --> 00:03:46,647
Why does that
not surprise me?

00:03:46,714 --> 00:03:48,149
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:03:48,216 --> 00:03:51,586
Man, something stinks
in here again.

00:03:51,652 --> 00:03:53,888
What, bad milk?
Cottage-cheese bad?

00:03:53,955 --> 00:03:56,123
Worse. It's all
over my sandwich.

00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,225
Smell that.

00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,852
( <i>sniffs</i> )

00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:05,054
( <i>groans</i> )

00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:06,990
Yeah.

00:04:07,056 --> 00:04:09,208
He's got one of his
experiments in there.

00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,342
You're kidding me?

00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:11,377
Bugs or blood?

00:04:11,443 --> 00:04:12,378
Not bugs.

00:04:12,444 --> 00:04:13,512
Oh, that's so not cool.

00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:14,847
That's a community fridge.

00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:17,383
Someone has got to talk
to Grissom about this.

00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:18,651
Talk to me about what?

00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,320
You leaving your
experiments in our
refrigerator.

00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:22,655
The lab fridge was full.

00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:23,822
I put in last night.

00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:24,823
Well...

00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:25,858
I'm going to test

00:04:25,925 --> 00:04:27,226
for horizontal motion
on bloodstains.

00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:29,595
Vis-a-vis surface
textures.

00:04:29,662 --> 00:04:32,164
Hey, any of you guys got
any linoleum at home?

00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:35,201
STOKES:
That blood
is rank, man.

00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:35,959
I know. That's why the
Red Cross gives it to us

00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:39,038
'cause it's past
its expiration date.

00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:45,711
Anything new on the
body farm victim?

00:04:45,778 --> 00:04:47,179
I gave the prints
to Identification.

00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:48,747
They're running through
the bases now.

00:04:48,814 --> 00:04:49,849
Okay.

00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,017
( <i>pager beeping</i> )

00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:56,522
I'll be in autopsy. Let me know.

00:04:57,823 --> 00:04:58,757
Way to go, Nick.

00:04:58,824 --> 00:04:59,992
You really told him.

00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:01,694
I told him, he just...

00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,962
doesn't hear it.

00:05:03,028 --> 00:05:04,029
BROWN:
Yeah.

00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:06,866
Well...

00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:10,703
the entry wound tells me
the body sustained a projectile.

00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,238
A bullet.

00:05:12,304 --> 00:05:16,075
Uh, but there's no bullet
fragments in the tissue

00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:17,543
and no exit wound.

00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,278
So, how do you explain that?

00:05:19,345 --> 00:05:21,580
Bullet wounds usually
leave bullet evidence.

00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:29,955
There's no evidence
of a bullet in this wound tract.

00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:31,357
So, let's excise it.

00:05:31,423 --> 00:05:33,259
Do a more localized search.

00:05:33,325 --> 00:05:34,994
That was my next suggestion.

00:05:35,995 --> 00:05:37,963
What's your best tool

00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,732
for excising the tissue
of our Mr. Doe?

00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,300
Oh, it's not a John Doe anymore.

00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:42,902
Database says
that our victim

00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,303
is Mike Kimble

00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,538
age 38.

00:05:45,604 --> 00:05:48,207
He has a townhouse
in Summerlin.

00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:49,775
Brass is going to meet
us there along

00:05:49,842 --> 00:05:50,976
with the rest
of the unit.

00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:53,145
My bet says that it's
the primary crime scene.

00:05:53,212 --> 00:05:55,281
Good.

00:05:56,515 --> 00:05:57,683
Aren't you coming?

00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:01,153
We're excising
a wound tract.

00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,208
Sounds fascinating.

00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,000
It is.

00:06:04,857 --> 00:06:07,493
( <i>loud whirring</i> )

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,262
( <i>siren blaring</i> )

00:06:12,631 --> 00:06:14,195
Is that Mike Kimble's house?

00:06:14,195 --> 00:06:15,296
That's it.

00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,915
Seems like somebody
beat us here.

00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,416
You think?

00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:27,020
Neighbor called it in.
She smelled the smoke.

00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,255
Thought he was barbecuing
in his living room.

00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,057
Where's his neighbor now?

00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,093
Over there talking to Brass.

00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:37,097
Um, no, I didn't hear any noise
coming from Mike's place

00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,465
last night.

00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:39,766
But, um...

00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,102
I was wearing my headphones,
doing my workout.

00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,370
Did Mr. Kimble have many
visitors to his house?

00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,673
Other than his clients,
just, um...

00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,174
just his fiancee, Jane.

00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,344
Uh, but they usually
stayed at her place.

00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,313
Do you have the full name
and address

00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:54,948
of the victim's fiancee Jane?

00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,082
Yes, actually I do.

00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,250
It's in my kitchen.

00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:01,020
As soon as they let me back in
I can get for you.

00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,388
BRASS:
Good. Yes.

00:07:05,362 --> 00:07:07,654
Something...

00:07:07,654 --> 00:07:09,155
a metal fragment.

00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:12,859
It's not like any bullet
I've ever seen.

00:07:12,926 --> 00:07:14,694
Titanium...

00:07:14,761 --> 00:07:16,429
maybe a pin.

00:07:16,496 --> 00:07:18,698
From the ribs?

00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:21,100
Oh, here's
the manufacturer's number.

00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:24,037
I should've bought stock
when I first started finding

00:07:24,103 --> 00:07:26,306
all these medical implants.

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,680
Bovine.

00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:35,148
Excuse me?

00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:36,416
Genus Hypaderma.

00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:39,819
These are normally found
in the intestinal tract of cows.

00:07:39,886 --> 00:07:42,722
These maggots aren't
found in humans.

00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:44,324
Foreign tissue. Cow.

00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,459
Makes absolutely no sense.

00:07:46,526 --> 00:07:51,397
The body farm also studies
animals, not just humans.

00:07:51,464 --> 00:07:54,367
This more of your
cross contamination?

00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:57,337
Only one way to find out.

00:08:15,155 --> 00:08:17,090
What up, doc?

00:08:17,157 --> 00:08:18,224
Oh, there you are.

00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,359
Sorry I'm late.

00:08:19,425 --> 00:08:21,861
D.A. wanted an update
on my robbery case.

00:08:21,928 --> 00:08:23,196
Oh, it's all good.

00:08:23,263 --> 00:08:25,365
I'm just starting
my walk-through.

00:08:28,201 --> 00:08:30,737
The desk is crispy.

00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,677
There's a burn pattern for you.

00:08:37,744 --> 00:08:39,813
Fire burns upward.

00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:42,715
This is moving downward.

00:08:42,782 --> 00:08:44,717
Defies the laws of physics.

00:08:44,784 --> 00:08:46,452
Fire's drawn to fire.

00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,755
Could have started upstairs.

00:08:48,822 --> 00:08:50,890
Check out the upstairs?

00:08:50,957 --> 00:08:53,092
The guy who started the fire

00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:56,563
wanted to make sure the
bedroom got it worse.

00:08:56,629 --> 00:08:57,997
How do you know it's a guy?

00:08:58,064 --> 00:08:59,532
Why are you jumping the gun?

00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:01,167
Well, according to Sara

00:09:01,234 --> 00:09:03,303
94% of all arsonists
are male.

00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:05,271
Yeah, that sounds
like Sara.

00:09:05,338 --> 00:09:08,441
The fire burned longest here.

00:09:08,508 --> 00:09:10,276
It's the point of origin.

00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:15,081
I don't smell any accelerant.

00:09:15,148 --> 00:09:16,249
Could have burned off.

00:09:16,316 --> 00:09:17,750
Fabric would have fueled it.

00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:19,719
I don't know.
It doesn't make any sense.

00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:21,054
A fire burning downward?

00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:25,792
STOKES:
<i>Must have found an accelerant.</i>

00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:31,865
<i>Furniture polish.</i>

00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,805
Warrick...

00:09:44,277 --> 00:09:46,713
Is that blood?

00:09:50,617 --> 00:09:52,819
Oh, man.

00:09:52,886 --> 00:09:55,221
Something bad happened here.

00:09:55,288 --> 00:09:58,525
This fire is just a cover up.

00:10:04,864 --> 00:10:06,583
GIRL ( <i>giggling</i> ):
Are you serious?

00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,000
Hold on a second. Hi.

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,041
I'm Detective Jim Brass.

00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,500
Is Jane Bradley in?

00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,250
She's in the kitchen.

00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,417
GIRL:
Really? No way.

00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,542
JANE:
This can't be happening.

00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:20,750
Mike is dead?

00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,417
I don't know how
I'm going to tell my kids.

00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,208
They love Mike.

00:10:27,922 --> 00:10:30,291
You and Mike were engaged?

00:10:30,358 --> 00:10:34,796
The wedding was supposed to
be in a week at the Tangiers.

00:10:34,862 --> 00:10:36,464
( <i>door opens</i> )

00:10:39,968 --> 00:10:42,036
No sweets after 10:00.
What's the rule?

00:10:42,103 --> 00:10:44,272
Oh, come on, Mom,
I'm starving.

00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,107
Have an apple.

00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:49,177
( <i>groans</i> )

00:10:49,243 --> 00:10:52,080
He's growing
like a weed.

00:10:52,146 --> 00:10:54,983
What was your
fiance's business?

00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:56,884
He was a photographer.

00:10:56,951 --> 00:10:59,020
He did weddings, events.

00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:01,708
We argued over who'd
do our wedding because

00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,077
he didn't trust
anyone else's work.

00:11:04,144 --> 00:11:06,013
( <i>door opens and closes</i> )

00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,460
Hi.

00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:09,333
How many times

00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,500
have I said you have to knock?

00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,000
You can't just
barge in this house.

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,375
Maybe as many times
as I've asked you

00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:17,069
to have the kids
ready and out front
on my nights?

00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,604
You must be the ex-husband.

00:11:19,671 --> 00:11:21,106
What's going on?

00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:22,908
Are the kids
all right?

00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,643
Is Jake in some kind of trouble?

00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,278
No.

00:11:26,345 --> 00:11:27,946
Mike Kimble was
killed last night.

00:11:28,013 --> 00:11:29,981
Are you serious?

00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,954
Would you mind
showing us your hands?

00:11:36,021 --> 00:11:37,589
My hands? Why?

00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:41,626
To see if there's any gun powder
or evidence of a burn on them.

00:11:41,693 --> 00:11:43,829
Sure.

00:11:45,197 --> 00:11:47,232
Look, uh, I don't want
to be rude, but...

00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:49,601
I stop paying alimony the day
Mike and Jane get married.

00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,937
I mean, I'm the last person
who would have killed him.

00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:54,006
If we wanted to get in touch
with you

00:11:54,072 --> 00:11:55,340
how would we reach you?

00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:56,166
You can reach me

00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,375
at any of my four
grocery stores.

00:11:58,667 --> 00:11:59,500
Any time.

00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:00,909
We'll be in touch.

00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:05,166
I'm going to get the kids
if that's all right.

00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:07,015
They're in the den.

00:12:10,152 --> 00:12:13,288
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,344
( <i>beeping grows more rapid</i> )

00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:31,449
Accelerant.

00:12:31,516 --> 00:12:33,084
Hey.

00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,854
Yeah, Warrick said
the fire was orange

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,555
so low-temperature fuel.

00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:39,458
Something accessible...

00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,361
gasoline, kerosene...

00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:44,229
I thought you
were at the post.

00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:45,264
I was.

00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:49,201
So, anyway, this is where
the fire started.

00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,769
Victim's bedroom.

00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,409
STOKES:
Grissom...

00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,046
Gris...

00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:37,015
Sometimes it's about
where the fire <i>isn't.</i>

00:14:08,976 --> 00:14:11,045
Sometimes I hate this job.

00:14:15,393 --> 00:14:16,226
BRASS:
We have evidence

00:14:16,226 --> 00:14:17,476
that Mike may
have had

00:14:17,476 --> 00:14:20,393
an inappropriate
relationship
with your daughter.

00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,429
What kind of evidence?

00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:24,898
Photographic
and definitive.

00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:27,375
That the man
I was going to marry

00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,875
somehow sexually...

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,161
No, I don't believe that.

00:14:32,228 --> 00:14:33,462
Things like this
happen

00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:35,331
sometimes right
under our noses.

00:14:35,398 --> 00:14:36,351
We're going
to have to talk

00:14:36,351 --> 00:14:38,987
with your daughter.

00:14:39,054 --> 00:14:42,124
Jody, we found pictures
in Mike's house

00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,859
of you posing.

00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:47,095
Tell her Mike would
never do anything
to hurt you.

00:14:49,965 --> 00:14:52,334
In some of the pictures...

00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:54,569
He truly was like
a father to both kids.

00:14:54,636 --> 00:14:58,840
I wish you would
just listen once.

00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,977
In some of the pictures

00:15:02,044 --> 00:15:04,946
you're wearing a bathing suit.

00:15:07,315 --> 00:15:09,684
Do you remember
Mike taking them?

00:15:20,262 --> 00:15:22,864
Jody...

00:15:22,931 --> 00:15:27,369
Anything that he did to you
was not your fault.

00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:32,174
You can tell me
if Mike took
those pictures.

00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:34,743
Jody?

00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,378
Honey?

00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:39,014
I loved Mike

00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:41,149
and he loved me.

00:15:52,794 --> 00:15:53,995
The daughter clammed up.

00:15:54,062 --> 00:15:56,364
Seems to be in the
protect-the-abuser trap.

00:15:56,431 --> 00:15:59,501
I'm going to take her
over to the hospital
for a SART exam.

00:15:59,568 --> 00:16:02,504
What are the chances
Mom knew what her
boyfriend was up to?

00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:03,572
I've seen it happen.

00:16:03,638 --> 00:16:04,806
As a mother,
I hope not.

00:16:04,873 --> 00:16:06,775
Yeah, right.

00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:08,510
I'm going
to look into it.

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,237
Well, our photo guys tell me
those pictures were taken

00:16:21,303 --> 00:16:22,542
with Mike Kimble's
type of camera.

00:16:22,542 --> 00:16:23,543
Yeah?

00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,145
Yeah.

00:16:25,212 --> 00:16:26,947
What are you
doing here?

00:16:27,014 --> 00:16:28,682
A thousand points
of light

00:16:28,749 --> 00:16:31,685
and I only need one
to clear up this picture.

00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:39,059
The blur equals
the length of the light.

00:16:39,126 --> 00:16:41,294
If I can compress this light
back into a point

00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:44,131
then the rest of the picture
gets clear.

00:16:47,768 --> 00:16:49,469
That's how they got
Hinkley's image

00:16:49,536 --> 00:16:51,071
when he was shooting the Prez.

00:16:51,138 --> 00:16:53,073
What is that?

00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,342
There at the bottom
right corner?

00:16:55,409 --> 00:16:56,576
is that a finger?

00:16:56,643 --> 00:16:58,311
Yeah, I think so.

00:16:58,378 --> 00:16:59,946
Well, that's unusual, isn't it?

00:17:00,013 --> 00:17:02,816
A professional photographer
gets a finger in the shot?

00:17:02,883 --> 00:17:05,552
Maybe his good hand
was otherwise engaged.

00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,387
I'm going to work
on that for a while

00:17:07,454 --> 00:17:09,723
and see if I can get
some ridge detail.

00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,158
Maybe even a fat print.

00:17:11,224 --> 00:17:13,994
I'll... I'll see you later.

00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:16,997
( <i>buzzing</i> )

00:17:21,401 --> 00:17:25,038
So because you found beef in
the wound tracts of the victim

00:17:25,105 --> 00:17:28,809
you think the meat might be
from one of the body farm cows?

00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,511
Did the fly find
the beef in the wound

00:17:31,578 --> 00:17:32,713
and lay its eggs

00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:35,148
or did it bring
the beef with him.

00:17:35,215 --> 00:17:37,784
SIDLE:
I did an experiment
similar to this in San Francisco

00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:39,686
except the cross-contamination
was blood.

00:17:39,753 --> 00:17:43,156
Wasn't a murder case,
but it was instructional.

00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:46,927
None of these
beef particles

00:17:46,994 --> 00:17:48,462
are as big as
the tissue

00:17:48,528 --> 00:17:50,831
found in Mike Kimble's
wound tract.

00:17:52,632 --> 00:17:55,302
And I found out
the ex-husband

00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:59,239
is the proud owner
of a registered handgun.

00:17:59,306 --> 00:18:01,375
Hmm, what does
that mean?

00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:03,910
It means I need
to see that gun.

00:18:03,977 --> 00:18:05,145
Uh, Grissom...

00:18:05,212 --> 00:18:07,714
Aren't you going
to tell me anything?

00:18:07,781 --> 00:18:08,982
About?

00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:12,252
The case, the meat,
what you found...?

00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:13,620
I'm working it.

00:18:13,687 --> 00:18:16,056
I thought I was
working it with you.

00:18:16,123 --> 00:18:17,557
Yes.

00:18:17,624 --> 00:18:19,159
You're right,
you are.

00:18:19,226 --> 00:18:22,396
So, take some photos
of the experiment for the D.A.

00:18:22,462 --> 00:18:24,364
and then get rid
of that stuff.

00:18:24,431 --> 00:18:26,733
That meat... the raw meat... me?

00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,634
Yeah.

00:18:27,701 --> 00:18:29,670
How many meals
have we shared together?

00:18:29,736 --> 00:18:30,537
I don't know.

00:18:30,604 --> 00:18:31,538
Take a guess--

00:18:31,605 --> 00:18:33,407
over a year working together.

00:18:33,473 --> 00:18:35,375
Thirty.

00:18:35,442 --> 00:18:36,610
I'm a vegetarian.

00:18:36,677 --> 00:18:38,445
Everyone here knows
I'm a vegetarian.

00:18:38,512 --> 00:18:39,813
I haven't eaten meat

00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,149
since we stayed up that night
with that dead pig.

00:18:42,215 --> 00:18:45,052
It pains me to see ground beef;
forget about cleaning it up.

00:18:45,118 --> 00:18:46,987
Okay.

00:18:47,054 --> 00:18:48,288
Have Nick do it.

00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,798
You're telling me

00:18:57,864 --> 00:19:00,801
this bastard took
pictures of my daughter?

00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:03,870
Yes, we found them
at his house.

00:19:03,937 --> 00:19:07,174
I never liked the way
he looked at Jody.

00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,175
I never liked it.

00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:09,543
How did he look at her?

00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:11,211
Touchy-feely.

00:19:11,278 --> 00:19:12,746
<i>It wasn't normal.</i>

00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:16,516
I told Jane when
she started seeing him

00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,684
he's not a good guy.

00:19:17,751 --> 00:19:20,120
He's not good
for our family.

00:19:20,187 --> 00:19:24,925
But you can't control
who your ex-wife dates.

00:19:24,992 --> 00:19:27,327
Russ Bradley,
Gil Grissom, CSI Lab.

00:19:27,394 --> 00:19:28,895
Thanks for coming in.

00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,798
Is this your gun?

00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:33,066
Yes.

00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:35,068
May I take a look at it?

00:19:35,135 --> 00:19:36,603
Please.

00:19:43,677 --> 00:19:45,479
It's been cleaned.

00:19:45,545 --> 00:19:46,546
Of course.

00:19:46,613 --> 00:19:48,148
You never store
a dirty firearm.

00:19:48,215 --> 00:19:50,384
May I ask what kind
of ammunition you use?

00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,618
A .38 special.

00:19:51,685 --> 00:19:53,120
It takes .38s.

00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:57,991
Whatever's on sale.

00:20:10,771 --> 00:20:12,606
There you are.

00:20:12,673 --> 00:20:15,942
Got something
for you from Trace.

00:20:16,943 --> 00:20:18,045
Sara?

00:20:18,111 --> 00:20:20,647
Almost finished.

00:20:25,252 --> 00:20:28,221
They isolated
the accelerant
used in the fire.

00:20:28,288 --> 00:20:29,589
It's alcohol based.

00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,494
Acetone, methyl
methacrylate?

00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:36,797
Nail polish remover.

00:20:36,863 --> 00:20:39,733
Guess that's
the six percent
no one talks about.

00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,168
Female fire starters.

00:20:49,276 --> 00:20:51,845
What's this... a burn?

00:20:51,912 --> 00:20:53,647
Yeah.

00:20:53,714 --> 00:20:55,882
DOCTOR:
How'd that happen?

00:20:55,949 --> 00:20:57,918
On a curling iron.

00:21:09,563 --> 00:21:11,398
I'll give you
a prescription
for antibiotics.

00:21:11,465 --> 00:21:14,301
Let's do the last portion
of your exam now, okay?

00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:16,837
Excuse me.

00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,243
Okay, lay back.

00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,345
Scoot back
a little more.

00:21:25,412 --> 00:21:27,114
Just a little more.

00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,248
Very good.

00:21:28,315 --> 00:21:30,751
Take a deep breath.

00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:32,285
This won't
hurt at all.

00:22:04,317 --> 00:22:06,286
It's melting.

00:22:43,724 --> 00:22:46,226
I thought Nick
asked you not to
put experiments

00:22:46,293 --> 00:22:47,794
in our communal
refrigerator.

00:22:47,861 --> 00:22:50,497
I'm putting it
in the freezer.

00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:56,937
The doctor finished
the exam on Jody Bradley.

00:22:57,004 --> 00:22:58,605
Physical findings:

00:22:58,672 --> 00:23:01,742
scarring,
chronic sexual abuse.

00:23:01,808 --> 00:23:02,776
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:23:02,843 --> 00:23:04,177
Well, have Brass get a warrant

00:23:04,244 --> 00:23:05,278
for the mother's house.

00:23:05,345 --> 00:23:06,747
Check the evidence we recovered

00:23:06,813 --> 00:23:08,281
from the dead boyfriend's house.

00:23:08,348 --> 00:23:09,583
They stayed in both places.

00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:12,419
Listen, there's a good chance
the daughter's our arsonist.

00:23:12,486 --> 00:23:14,454
She had second-degree burns
on our wrist.

00:23:14,521 --> 00:23:15,956
One thing at a time.

00:23:16,023 --> 00:23:17,024
Right.

00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,091
You coming with?

00:23:18,158 --> 00:23:19,292
I can't.

00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,327
Take Nick.

00:23:20,394 --> 00:23:22,996
Right.

00:23:23,063 --> 00:23:24,898
Experiment.

00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:27,734
A warrant?

00:23:27,801 --> 00:23:29,336
Uh-huh.

00:24:16,616 --> 00:24:18,952
We've got some samples
coming in.

00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:20,520
They're priority one.

00:24:20,587 --> 00:24:22,289
What is that...
what did you find?

00:24:22,356 --> 00:24:25,192
Child Services will
be remanding Jody
to a foster home.

00:24:25,258 --> 00:24:27,961
Was my fiance involved
in any way?

00:24:28,028 --> 00:24:30,697
He's not your fiance.

00:24:30,764 --> 00:24:31,965
Not anymore, anyway.

00:24:32,032 --> 00:24:33,100
Jim?

00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:34,234
I just got back

00:24:34,301 --> 00:24:36,770
from the events office
at the Tangiers

00:24:36,837 --> 00:24:39,206
where you and Mike
were supposed
to be married.

00:24:39,272 --> 00:24:40,674
You canceled
your wedding
five days ago.

00:24:40,741 --> 00:24:42,075
I even have your
credit card receipt

00:24:42,142 --> 00:24:44,945
for the ten percent
cancellation charge.

00:24:45,012 --> 00:24:47,481
You didn't like the way
he looked at your daughter

00:24:47,547 --> 00:24:48,715
any more than
your ex did.

00:24:48,782 --> 00:24:50,050
No. I just got cold feet.

00:24:50,117 --> 00:24:52,052
Convenient timing.

00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:54,221
Look, when Russ and I got
married 20 years ago

00:24:54,287 --> 00:24:55,922
you couldn't find
two happier people

00:24:55,989 --> 00:24:58,659
and now we can barely
stand to be civil.

00:24:58,725 --> 00:25:00,093
I didn't want to make
another mistake.

00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,063
It wasn't that you sensed
what was going on?

00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,999
Mike would not do
what he's being accused of.

00:25:06,066 --> 00:25:08,268
Believe me.

00:25:08,335 --> 00:25:10,337
I'll believe the DNA.

00:25:16,678 --> 00:25:18,380
Feels like blackjack, you know?

00:25:18,446 --> 00:25:21,483
You guys all fanned around
the table, holding your breath

00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:23,852
waiting to see
which card I'll reveal next.

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,453
Greg, this is
an abuse case

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,722
involving a minor.

00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:30,425
Right. Sorry.

00:25:31,793 --> 00:25:33,528
So, I have DNA samples
from every male

00:25:33,595 --> 00:25:35,030
that lives with Jody Bradley

00:25:35,096 --> 00:25:37,399
full-time or weekends.

00:25:37,466 --> 00:25:40,235
First, I have Mike Kimble,
the fiance.

00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:42,370
Dead fiance.

00:25:42,437 --> 00:25:44,539
BRASS:
"Match not found."

00:25:44,606 --> 00:25:46,141
You got to be kidding me.

00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,609
Sorry, Captain.

00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:50,312
The guy has naked pictures
of her in his townhouse.

00:25:50,378 --> 00:25:52,247
The mother called off
their wedding.

00:25:52,314 --> 00:25:54,316
DNA takes a pair.

00:25:54,382 --> 00:25:56,551
So, whose is it,
the father?

00:25:56,618 --> 00:25:59,788
"Match not found."

00:25:59,855 --> 00:26:01,189
SANDERS:
Third and last.

00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:04,926
Give me that.

00:26:08,163 --> 00:26:10,098
How'd we miss that?

00:26:10,165 --> 00:26:12,734
No. No, I never did

00:26:12,801 --> 00:26:14,469
anything like that
to my sister, no.

00:26:14,536 --> 00:26:15,770
BRASS:
How do you explain

00:26:15,837 --> 00:26:17,772
your semen on her nightgown?

00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:22,010
I can't... I can't.

00:26:25,013 --> 00:26:26,303
The county automatically
provides your son

00:26:26,303 --> 00:26:27,671
with an advocate.

00:26:27,737 --> 00:26:30,640
We can't proceed
until he arrives.

00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:37,814
You getting anywhere
with the print?

00:26:37,881 --> 00:26:40,116
I'm still trying
to enhance it.

00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:42,219
It's kind of
frustrating,
that, uh

00:26:42,285 --> 00:26:45,555
this picture puts us
at the very moment
of the crime

00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:47,190
but we can't see
what she's seeing.

00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:49,359
They say the eyes are
the window to the soul.

00:26:49,426 --> 00:26:51,628
Yeah, my grandma used
to say that all the time.

00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:53,196
In a way, it's true.

00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:56,766
The aqueous fluid and the
vitreous in the human eye

00:26:56,833 --> 00:26:59,769
allows for an image
to be reflected in it.

00:26:59,836 --> 00:27:04,808
Well, maybe... if I enhanced
the reflection in her eye

00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:08,411
with the right combination
of algorithms...

00:27:08,478 --> 00:27:11,715
I think my Popsicles
are ready.

00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:15,151
Jake, did you take pictures
of your sister

00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:17,153
and plant them
in Mike Kimble's house?

00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,055
No.

00:27:19,122 --> 00:27:23,793
You do have keys
to his house, though. Right?

00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:28,064
I mean, your mother told us
that both you kids do.

00:27:28,131 --> 00:27:30,300
Yes, but I didn't
plant anything.

00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:33,236
He didn't take the pictures.
He didn't plant them.

00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:37,173
He has no idea how
his DNA got in his
sister's nightgown.

00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,010
Well, maybe a little hobbit
put it there.

00:27:42,379 --> 00:27:43,847
That's it, we're done.

00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:44,881
All right, hold on.

00:27:46,216 --> 00:27:47,651
You mind if I talk
to Jake alone?

00:27:47,717 --> 00:27:48,985
To what end?

00:27:51,354 --> 00:27:52,856
I have a hunch.

00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:57,494
Everyone does it, Jake.

00:27:57,561 --> 00:28:00,664
You just... feel like
you're the only one.

00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,599
Then when you don't do it

00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:05,335
it happens in your
sleep anyway, right?

00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:09,639
Yeah. And then you
go to take a leak

00:28:09,706 --> 00:28:11,508
dust off the equipment

00:28:11,575 --> 00:28:14,978
and just grab the first
thing that's handy, huh?

00:28:18,315 --> 00:28:21,184
It was just... on the hamper.

00:28:21,251 --> 00:28:23,320
Your sister's nightgown?

00:28:23,386 --> 00:28:25,989
( <i>laughing softly</i> )

00:28:26,056 --> 00:28:29,259
The next thing I know,
I'm getting, like...

00:28:29,326 --> 00:28:32,028
questioned by the police

00:28:32,095 --> 00:28:33,663
and my parents are looking at me

00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,966
like I'm some sort of...
pervert.

00:28:36,032 --> 00:28:39,769
Yeah, that's rough. Rough.

00:28:39,836 --> 00:28:42,305
Well, listen, in
the future, dude...

00:28:42,372 --> 00:28:44,674
even if the situation's
embarrassing

00:28:44,741 --> 00:28:47,244
the truth's probably
the best policy there.

00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:50,213
Yeah.

00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,415
Hey, listen, you
ever notice your
mom's boyfriend

00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:53,984
acting weird around
your sister?

00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,252
Like a little, uh...

00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:59,122
too friendly,
too forward?

00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:02,926
Mmm, no.

00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:07,597
No, I mean, my sister is
the one that's kind of weird.

00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:08,698
Really?
Yeah.

00:29:08,765 --> 00:29:09,866
How?

00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:12,602
She's just always just,
you know, "Mike's coming over.

00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:14,471
I can't wait
till Mike gets here."

00:29:14,537 --> 00:29:16,873
Mm. Mm-hmm.

00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,541
You like the guy?

00:29:18,608 --> 00:29:22,045
When, uh, my parents
were getting divorced

00:29:22,112 --> 00:29:25,215
my mom, she cried,
like, every day

00:29:25,282 --> 00:29:27,417
and, uh, Mike showed up

00:29:27,484 --> 00:29:29,586
and she stopped crying

00:29:29,653 --> 00:29:34,157
so, yeah. I guess.

00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:52,642
What are you doing here?

00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:54,177
Isn't this your day off?

00:29:54,244 --> 00:29:57,814
On the day you plan
to expend a meat bullet?

00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,485
Frozen?

00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:06,156
Yeah, I had to freeze it with
a touch of liquid nitrogen.

00:30:06,223 --> 00:30:08,525
Well, I'm ready
to watch history.

00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:27,510
Bullet-like

00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:28,845
entry wound.

00:30:34,317 --> 00:30:37,954
The soft tissue. Hm.

00:30:38,021 --> 00:30:40,090
You're quite
a marksman, Russ.

00:30:40,156 --> 00:30:45,495
And inventive-- you managed
to build a bullet made of meat.

00:30:45,562 --> 00:30:48,932
The meat from the projectile
was visually indistinguishable

00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:51,935
from the victim's
stomach tissue.

00:30:52,002 --> 00:30:54,537
We know that
your gun was clean

00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:57,340
but it turns out
that your re-loader wasn't.

00:30:57,407 --> 00:30:59,976
Yeah. We got this from
your garage on a warrant.

00:31:00,043 --> 00:31:02,245
We figured a gun enthusiast
like yourself

00:31:02,312 --> 00:31:03,747
would have one of these.

00:31:03,813 --> 00:31:05,682
Packs gunpowder
into used shell casings.

00:31:05,749 --> 00:31:07,551
Cheaper than buying
new rounds, right?

00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:12,055
The material that
was on your re-loader

00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:13,957
is consistent with
the material we found

00:31:14,024 --> 00:31:15,559
in the victim's wound tract.

00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,727
Ground beef.

00:31:20,497 --> 00:31:22,999
A father knows.

00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:28,905
He was giving her gifts,
you know, cameras.

00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,246
He gave her a camera?

00:31:39,115 --> 00:31:41,985
And the wedding was,
like, a week off

00:31:42,052 --> 00:31:44,054
and he was going
to be living

00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,056
under the same roof as
my children full-time.

00:31:46,122 --> 00:31:48,325
When I went over there

00:31:48,391 --> 00:31:51,261
you know, I was just going
to set him straight, right?

00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:53,163
You know what he says?

00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,599
Now, I can't help it
if she likes me.

00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:58,201
I guess it's like mother,
like daughter.

00:31:58,268 --> 00:32:02,539
You touch my little girl
and I will kill you.

00:32:02,606 --> 00:32:04,174
Too late.

00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:06,176
<i>That's when I lost it.</i>

00:32:06,243 --> 00:32:09,079
Then you dumped him
at the body farm.

00:32:09,145 --> 00:32:12,916
Your grocery chain makes
regular meat deliveries there

00:32:12,983 --> 00:32:15,118
for experimental purposes.

00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:17,454
Then what?

00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,358
You arsoned his place
to cover up the murder?

00:32:21,424 --> 00:32:24,995
GRISSOM:
<i>Grabbed the nail polish remover</i>
<i>from the bedside table</i>

00:32:25,061 --> 00:32:26,963
<i>poured it all over the place?</i>

00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,565
I'll tell you the truth.

00:32:28,632 --> 00:32:29,766
I...

00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:33,069
I feel relieved.

00:32:33,136 --> 00:32:36,406
I'd like to make
a formal confession.

00:32:36,473 --> 00:32:38,008
He can confess
to the homicide

00:32:38,074 --> 00:32:40,377
but we're still examining
evidence on the arson.

00:32:40,443 --> 00:32:43,213
The guy wants to take the heat
for his daughter on the arson

00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,881
well, where's
the harm in that?

00:32:44,948 --> 00:32:47,017
The harm would be
to the justice system

00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:48,852
unless I misunderstand
our place in it.

00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:51,388
Don't you think that little
girl's been through enough?

00:32:51,454 --> 00:32:53,290
What I think and what
the evidence proves

00:32:53,356 --> 00:32:56,459
are possibly
two different things.

00:33:00,797 --> 00:33:02,399
What is this?

00:33:02,465 --> 00:33:04,367
It's, uh, just what it says:

00:33:04,434 --> 00:33:06,803
it's a request
for a leave of absence--

00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:10,173
six months... year, maybe.

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,508
Why?

00:33:11,575 --> 00:33:13,276
I was thinking
of checking out

00:33:13,343 --> 00:33:17,013
the federal government
system-- FBI...

00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,381
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:33:18,448 --> 00:33:21,017
We have the best lab
in the country.

00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:24,588
I need a different
work environment.

00:33:24,654 --> 00:33:26,156
What does <i>that</i> mean?

00:33:26,223 --> 00:33:30,860
One with, um, communication...

00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:32,696
respect.

00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:34,531
Everybody here respects you.

00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:35,765
You don't.

00:33:35,832 --> 00:33:39,703
Is this about
that hamburger thing?

00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:42,272
No. Grissom...

00:33:42,339 --> 00:33:44,407
this is not about
that hamburger thing.

00:33:44,474 --> 00:33:46,610
I-I-I don't believe you.

00:33:46,676 --> 00:33:48,812
How can you reduce
everything that I've said

00:33:48,878 --> 00:33:50,280
to some kind
of single quirk?

00:33:50,347 --> 00:33:52,983
Do you think the problem here
is just about me?

00:33:55,085 --> 00:33:58,388
If you don't sign my leave,
I'm going to have to quit.

00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,996
Hey, Sara?

00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:12,769
The lab needs you here.

00:34:14,738 --> 00:34:16,406
Great.

00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:26,678
Did you hear the dad

00:34:26,678 --> 00:34:27,846
copped a plea
on the murder

00:34:27,913 --> 00:34:29,080
and the D.A.
expedited it?

00:34:30,053 --> 00:34:32,322
Voluntary man,
first offense.

00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:34,391
Out on bail.
Free in four.

00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:36,593
No jury was going
to convict a father

00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,628
for killing
his daughter's abuser.

00:34:38,695 --> 00:34:39,963
What do you have?

00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:43,967
Accelerant. Identical
to the type found
at the arson.

00:34:44,034 --> 00:34:47,037
Police got it out
of Jody's gym locker.

00:34:48,605 --> 00:34:49,906
( <i>sizzling</i> )

00:34:59,082 --> 00:35:01,518
Looks as if Jody
was probably telling the truth.

00:35:01,585 --> 00:35:04,421
She did burn herself
on a curling iron.

00:35:04,488 --> 00:35:06,490
So who started the fire?

00:35:24,474 --> 00:35:25,408
NICK:
Hey.
Hey.

00:35:25,475 --> 00:35:28,445
You get anywhere
with those fingerprints?

00:35:28,512 --> 00:35:29,446
Back burner.

00:35:29,513 --> 00:35:33,350
I've been working
on this reflection in her eye.

00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:35,285
You see
what I'm seeing?

00:35:35,352 --> 00:35:36,653
No.

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,654
Come on.

00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:40,223
I've been working on this
enhancement all night.

00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,625
Look closer.

00:35:41,691 --> 00:35:42,959
What is it?

00:35:43,026 --> 00:35:46,607
A clock, a mirror?

00:35:48,768 --> 00:35:53,706
It's got a latch,
a lock.

00:35:53,773 --> 00:35:55,208
A porthole?

00:35:55,274 --> 00:35:57,710
It's a porthole?

00:35:57,777 --> 00:35:59,746
Yeah.

00:35:59,812 --> 00:36:02,982
These pictures were taken
on a boat.

00:36:09,247 --> 00:36:10,181
Miss Bradley.

00:36:10,248 --> 00:36:11,249
Yes.

00:36:11,316 --> 00:36:12,784
Warrick Brown.

00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:16,654
Your fiance Mike,
did he own a boat?

00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:18,589
A boat? No.

00:36:18,656 --> 00:36:19,590
No?

00:36:19,657 --> 00:36:21,959
Did he borrow one
or rent one?

00:36:22,026 --> 00:36:24,262
He wanted to borrow
my ex-husband's boat

00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:25,963
but he was too proud to ask.

00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,699
Your ex-husband owned a boat?

00:36:27,765 --> 00:36:30,935
He bought one after our divorce.

00:36:31,002 --> 00:36:32,103
I've never been on it.

00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:34,972
Okay. Thank you.

00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:03,032
Jody?

00:37:03,581 --> 00:37:05,683
We know that Mike gave
you his camera.

00:37:10,372 --> 00:37:13,308
We suspect that your
father used it

00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:16,511
to take pictures of
you on his boat.

00:37:21,683 --> 00:37:22,751
We believe that

00:37:22,817 --> 00:37:25,720
he then placed
the camera back
at Mike's

00:37:25,787 --> 00:37:30,358
to implicate him
along with the pictures.

00:37:31,826 --> 00:37:35,163
He said I was like my mom
when she was young

00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,832
and they were happy.

00:37:37,899 --> 00:37:43,238
He said having me
was like having his
family back.

00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,552
Did you ever tell your mom?

00:37:53,321 --> 00:37:56,057
I tried.

00:37:56,124 --> 00:37:57,592
I don't want to go to Dad's.

00:37:57,658 --> 00:37:58,993
You know what the judge said:

00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,528
Two weeks with Dad,
two with me.

00:38:00,595 --> 00:38:07,201
Jody, we have strong forensic
evidence against your father.

00:38:07,268 --> 00:38:12,173
But cases like this are
very difficult to prove.

00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,377
A victim testifying
makes all the difference.

00:38:18,449 --> 00:38:21,786
He told me if I ever talked
he'd kill me.

00:38:21,852 --> 00:38:24,406
Jody, if you don't talk...

00:38:24,406 --> 00:38:26,809
I told Mike

00:38:26,876 --> 00:38:28,911
and he was going to fix things.

00:38:34,183 --> 00:38:38,487
And my dad killed him...

00:38:38,554 --> 00:38:40,322
okay?

00:38:40,389 --> 00:38:42,391
( <i>door opens</i> )

00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:44,827
BROWN:
Catherine.

00:38:48,063 --> 00:38:50,065
What is this?

00:38:50,132 --> 00:38:53,402
Found it on the boat.

00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:55,971
DNA just ran it.

00:38:58,507 --> 00:39:01,010
She's under 14, right?

00:39:01,076 --> 00:39:03,179
Yeah, 12.

00:39:15,057 --> 00:39:17,593
He didn't take pictures
of his daughter.

00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,028
He never touched her.

00:39:19,094 --> 00:39:21,931
He's a loving, devoted father
who works hard

00:39:21,997 --> 00:39:25,868
at his chain of grocery stores
to keep her in good schools.

00:39:25,935 --> 00:39:29,271
Except when she's on his boat,
right?

00:39:32,031 --> 00:39:35,668
This is your sleeping bag
we took off your boat.

00:39:35,735 --> 00:39:37,437
Our lab turned it
inside-out.

00:39:37,504 --> 00:39:39,072
The discoloration you see

00:39:39,139 --> 00:39:43,042
is a mixture of vaginal
and seminal fluid...

00:39:43,109 --> 00:39:45,678
your daughter's and yours.

00:39:46,946 --> 00:39:47,914
Okay.

00:39:48,322 --> 00:39:49,804
Don't say a word, Russ.

00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,095
He doesn't have to.

00:39:51,095 --> 00:39:54,455
The sleeping bag's talking
loud and clear.

00:39:57,721 --> 00:39:59,012
Brad, make me a deal.

00:39:59,012 --> 00:40:00,428
I can't.

00:40:00,495 --> 00:40:01,562
What do you mean you can't?

00:40:01,629 --> 00:40:02,964
You got me four years
for murder.

00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:03,965
I can't.

00:40:04,031 --> 00:40:05,095
You can get me something.

00:40:05,095 --> 00:40:07,101
No, he can't.

00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,550
In the state of Nevada

00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,251
we're all bound
by a legal statute.

00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:12,454
The sexual assault of a minor
age 14 and under

00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,892
is a mandatory life sentence
with no possibility for parole.

00:40:39,147 --> 00:40:40,081
Excuse me.

00:40:40,148 --> 00:40:42,717
Could I talk to you
for a moment?

00:40:42,784 --> 00:40:44,886
Why don't you wait
over there, sweetie.

00:40:44,953 --> 00:40:45,887
Okay.

00:40:45,954 --> 00:40:49,758
I owe you an apology.

00:40:49,824 --> 00:40:51,593
I have an eight-year-old
daughter.

00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:52,827
It's okay.

00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:57,688
You were looking out for mine.

00:41:14,384 --> 00:41:16,620
GRISSOM:
<i>Tough case, huh?</i>

00:41:16,686 --> 00:41:20,190
Just give me
a straight-ahead
murder any day.

00:41:20,257 --> 00:41:25,695
Well, you wouldn't be human
if it didn't affect you.

00:41:27,864 --> 00:41:32,402
I heard about you and Sara.

00:41:32,469 --> 00:41:37,340
Sara, you know,
she gets very emotional.

00:41:39,743 --> 00:41:40,744
Are you in denial?

00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:46,149
No, that's... no, no.
Way too analytical.

00:41:46,216 --> 00:41:48,919
Wow, you got burned bad, huh?

00:41:48,985 --> 00:41:50,587
Welcome to the club.

00:41:50,654 --> 00:41:54,090
I got third-degree burns
from my marriage.

00:41:54,157 --> 00:41:55,358
Happens to everybody.

00:41:55,425 --> 00:41:56,927
Everybody just moves on.

00:41:56,993 --> 00:41:59,596
Good.

00:41:59,663 --> 00:42:01,298
Let's move on.

00:42:01,364 --> 00:42:02,732
But you have
to deal with it.

00:42:02,799 --> 00:42:04,301
You have to deal
with it first.

00:42:04,367 --> 00:42:06,636
You got to deal with it
before it goes away.

00:42:06,703 --> 00:42:08,004
You are the supervisor.

00:42:08,071 --> 00:42:10,807
You have responsibilities,
and people are making

00:42:10,874 --> 00:42:12,876
a family around you
whether you like it not,

00:42:12,943 --> 00:42:14,845
whether you give them
permission or not.

00:42:17,414 --> 00:42:20,083
We don't have to go
to the Grand Tetons together.

00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,818
Just... every now and then

00:42:21,885 --> 00:42:25,288
you got to lift your head up
out of that microscope.

00:42:27,691 --> 00:42:29,492
Yeah.

00:42:52,415 --> 00:42:54,084
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:42:58,051 --> 00:42:59,553
( <i>dialing phone</i> )

00:43:03,717 --> 00:43:09,289
Yeah, hi. I'd like to get
some flowers for a girl.

00:43:09,356 --> 00:43:10,323
No, no. Not flowers.

00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:11,717
A plant. A living plant.

00:43:11,717 --> 00:43:13,753
She likes vegetation.

00:43:13,819 --> 00:43:16,389
Yeah, that'd be fine.

00:43:16,455 --> 00:43:18,858
To a Sara Sidle.

00:43:18,924 --> 00:43:19,959
Deliver it at

00:43:20,026 --> 00:43:22,895
the CSI Division,
Las Vegas Police Department

00:43:22,962 --> 00:43:25,264
the one out on North Trop
Boulevard.

00:43:25,331 --> 00:43:27,900
Yeah, you can bill me
at the same place.

00:43:27,967 --> 00:43:30,503
Gil Grissom.

00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:32,738
The sentiment?

00:43:32,805 --> 00:43:35,308
Oh, on the card.

00:43:35,374 --> 00:43:39,412
Um, uh...

00:43:39,478 --> 00:43:42,548
have it say...

00:43:42,615 --> 00:43:46,592
have it say, uh...

00:43:46,592 --> 00:43:49,675
"From Grissom."
Thank you.
