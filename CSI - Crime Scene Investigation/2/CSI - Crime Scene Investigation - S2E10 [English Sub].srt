00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,993
<i>(Rock music)</i>

00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:24,999
Are you all right?

00:00:25,127 --> 00:00:27,119
I'm barred.

00:00:27,254 --> 00:00:29,827
I've got, like, $10,000 in chips,

00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:32,717
and I cannot cash it.

00:00:32,843 --> 00:00:35,251
Look, if I kept an eye on you two,

00:00:35,387 --> 00:00:38,838
could you please just go in there
and just claim my money?

00:00:38,974 --> 00:00:43,019
Sure, we can do that for you,
but you don't have to keep your eye on us.

00:00:43,145 --> 00:00:44,722
We're honest people.

00:00:44,855 --> 00:00:49,481
I'm sure you are, but, come on,
if I'm gonna be giving you ten grand in chips,

00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,935
I just gotta know that you're coming back.

00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,063
We could give you a deposit.

00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:56,985
What kind of deposit?

00:00:57,117 --> 00:01:01,115
$2,000 would give me peace of mind.

00:01:01,246 --> 00:01:03,073
You do that,

00:01:03,207 --> 00:01:06,492
I will give you back your deposit
plus another thousand.

00:01:11,548 --> 00:01:13,874
I'm sorry, sir, I can't cash this for you.

00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:15,503
What? Why?

00:01:15,636 --> 00:01:16,916
They're worthless.

00:01:22,726 --> 00:01:24,304
(Car starts)

00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:30,430
(Gunshot)

00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:33,144
(Tyres screech)

00:01:33,278 --> 00:01:35,983
The guy was running
one of the oldest scams in Vegas.

00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:40,444
Would have got away with it too, until the
getaway driver put a nickel in the guy's jukebox.

00:01:40,577 --> 00:01:42,119
Those are the Ortons from Florida.

00:01:42,246 --> 00:01:44,285
Are you sure about that?

00:01:45,582 --> 00:01:48,916
The couple ID'd the deceased as the con man.

00:01:54,424 --> 00:01:56,251
That's the Ortons' money

00:01:56,385 --> 00:01:58,128
It's mine now.

00:01:58,262 --> 00:02:00,338
- Surveillance?
- Not in the garage.

00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:06,341
Banana skids and fresh blood. That helps.

00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:08,803
Oil slick doesn't hurt us either.

00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:10,267
Hey, Jim.

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,226
- Got these from the cage.
- Thanks, Sam.

00:02:14,778 --> 00:02:18,479
The chip clip. Haven't seen that one in a while.

00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:21,651
Striking resemblance to Judas.

00:02:21,785 --> 00:02:23,612
How's that?

00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:26,283
Both lost their lives
over a worthless bag of chips.

00:03:03,952 --> 00:03:05,945
<i>Punk rock music on hi-fi</i>

00:03:07,664 --> 00:03:09,657
Hey, Sanders. No punk rock.

00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:11,499
What about Black Flag?

00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:13,703
Are you nuts?

00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:19,169
Whoa! Careful.

00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:22,884
- Livestock. Hissing roaches from Madagascar.
- Sorry.

00:03:23,013 --> 00:03:25,006
These babies run 2 1/2 miles an hour.

00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:29,133
- I don't doubt it for a minute.
- 5th Annual Entomological Convention in Duluth.

00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:30,847
Cockroach racing finals.

00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:32,771
You're roach racing?

00:03:32,898 --> 00:03:36,397
Actually, I'm giving a tutorial
in preserving mass crime scenes.

00:03:36,527 --> 00:03:38,235
The sideshow is racing these guys.

00:03:38,362 --> 00:03:41,565
To nave a chance to run
against legendary roaches

00:03:41,698 --> 00:03:46,906
like Cocky Balboa, The Drain Lover,
Priscilla, Queen Of The Gutters. It's huge.

00:03:47,037 --> 00:03:48,994
- What do you feed those guys?
- Dog food.

00:03:49,123 --> 00:03:52,456
- And who's supervising Night shift?
- You are.

00:03:52,584 --> 00:03:55,455
Me? I am on the red-eye to Reno.

00:03:55,587 --> 00:03:58,292
The Braun family is opening a new casino.
I am Sam's date.

00:03:58,423 --> 00:04:00,416
That's tonight?

00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:02,757
I told you once. Memoed you twice.

00:04:03,929 --> 00:04:06,005
Man, these guys are primed.

00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:11,929
You better get somebody.

00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:14,980
A-slash? Acting supervisor.

00:04:15,107 --> 00:04:18,108
What about Nick? He's got seniority.

00:04:18,235 --> 00:04:20,275
Or Sara. She'd jump at the chance.

00:04:20,404 --> 00:04:22,610
If it was about seniority, I'd ask Nick.

00:04:22,739 --> 00:04:24,946
For staying up three straight days, I'd ask Sara.

00:04:25,075 --> 00:04:27,744
- Instead, I want you.
- And if I ask why?

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,621
Your curiosity
would be better served on the case.

00:04:30,747 --> 00:04:34,579
The shooting death of a con man
at the Tropicana. Our guys are already there.

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,702
Hang on.

00:04:36,837 --> 00:04:39,506
Have you told Nick and Sara about this?

00:04:39,631 --> 00:04:40,912
No.

00:05:42,694 --> 00:05:44,402
I got one left

00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,728
Smile.

00:05:47,658 --> 00:05:49,200
- Lovely.
- Hey.

00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:52,953
- Nice of you to show up.
- We're done here, brother.

00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,907
I'm sorry. I got detained.

00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,374
- You did a one-to-one on these treads?
- Yeah, I just finished.

00:05:58,502 --> 00:06:00,578
- Put together an evidence list?
- No.

00:06:00,712 --> 00:06:04,413
- You gotta do it. You were late.
- I don't think so. I gotta go back with the body.

00:06:06,677 --> 00:06:11,422
Sara, can you get back to the lab
and put a rush on this analysis?

00:06:11,557 --> 00:06:14,926
- Who died and made you boss?
- He's not exactly dead.

00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:18,763
Grissom gave you the shift tonight.

00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:27,191
Anything you wanna say?

00:06:27,322 --> 00:06:29,066
Yeah.

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,859
Good luck.

00:06:41,753 --> 00:06:43,746
Get a speeding ticket?

00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:46,965
Side roads. So...

00:06:47,092 --> 00:06:49,132
this is our con artiste?

00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:51,586
Vincent Thomas Avery. ID'd him from his prints.

00:06:51,722 --> 00:06:54,295
- Tell you anything?
- No mystery in cause of death.

00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:56,093
Gunshot wound to the outer ear.

00:06:56,226 --> 00:06:59,013
Left ear at that.

00:06:59,146 --> 00:07:01,185
Probably when he was getting into the car.

00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:05,941
He knew the driver.

00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:10,150
Soot deposition on the skin
surrounding the entry wound tells the story.

00:07:10,282 --> 00:07:15,193
The bullet entered the external
auditory meatus fracturing the skull base

00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:18,246
- The hardest bone of the skull.
- You got any pictures of that?

00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:20,247
Hot off the fluoroscope.

00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,368
Haven't had the pleasure yet.

00:07:24,838 --> 00:07:26,961
Hello! There is your bullet.

00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:30,175
Deformed projectile
on the right side of the calvarium.

00:07:30,302 --> 00:07:32,508
- Can you fish that out for me?
- You bet.

00:07:34,807 --> 00:07:36,349
Wait a minute.

00:07:41,146 --> 00:07:43,139
There's something in his stomach

00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:58,785
Something tells me
this isn't filled with white sugar.

00:08:02,251 --> 00:08:05,370
- How many more are there?
- I'd say about 50 balloons

00:08:05,504 --> 00:08:11,376
The green dye you see here
is probably from lime-flavoured gelatine.

00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,799
Makes them much easier to swallow.

00:08:13,929 --> 00:08:15,922
He's a mule.

00:08:17,474 --> 00:08:22,931
Why is a guy trafficking in big-pay drugs wasting
his time on some nickel-and-dime chip scam?

00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,181
Hey. I got the horsepower on your vic.

00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:30,686
Vincent Avery. Age 28.
Con man out of Atlantic City.

00:08:30,821 --> 00:08:34,404
Enough petty thefts and grand larcenies
on his record to choke a hippo.

00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:36,572
Hey, Jim.

00:08:36,702 --> 00:08:39,371
What do you make of that void? Nail?

00:08:39,455 --> 00:08:41,246
Either that or a spot on your lens.

00:08:41,373 --> 00:08:44,208
Don't say that.

00:08:48,672 --> 00:08:50,083
Hey!

00:08:50,215 --> 00:08:53,252
You making a cake?
What's the hold-up on my pills?

00:08:53,385 --> 00:08:54,844
Process.

00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,588
Just because you got passed over,
don't take it out on me.

00:08:58,724 --> 00:09:00,348
He didn't pass me over.

00:09:00,476 --> 00:09:04,176
- Really? What would you call it, then?
- Grissom.

00:09:04,313 --> 00:09:05,593
Ah.

00:09:18,535 --> 00:09:19,780
Coal.

00:09:21,497 --> 00:09:22,695
Wood

00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,701
And coconut shells.

00:09:36,178 --> 00:09:39,428
Activated carbon. Activated charcoal pills.

00:09:39,556 --> 00:09:43,506
Best antacid in the world.
Coats the stomach and absorbs impurities.

00:09:43,644 --> 00:09:46,182
It's great if you're a mule transporting drugs.

00:09:46,313 --> 00:09:47,938
Our con man's a mule?

00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:50,734
We found balloons of cocaine
in his stomach cavity.

00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:53,350
Without the pills one bite of a chocolate bar

00:09:53,487 --> 00:09:56,654
would produce enough gastric acid
to eat away the balloon

00:09:56,782 --> 00:09:58,490
causing him to OD.

00:09:58,617 --> 00:10:01,286
- Then he went out and got shot.
- Speaking of which,

00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,659
I found airline stubs in Avery's shirt.

00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:05,663
- What?
- Vincent Avery was 4A,

00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,582
Ellie Rebecca was 4B.

00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:09,667
Strange, right, using two first names?

00:10:09,795 --> 00:10:14,006
What's strange is going into the evidence locker
after post and finding nothing left.

00:10:14,133 --> 00:10:16,125
Don't make me feel bad for doing my job.

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,169
If it was your job, you couldn't feel bad.

00:10:19,555 --> 00:10:21,594
Well, I think I hear some coffee perking.

00:10:25,185 --> 00:10:28,305
What do you want from me?
I'm working the case. The case is hot.

00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:30,846
It's my case. Tonight, I'm the primary.

00:10:30,983 --> 00:10:34,980
I have to process it. If you have a problem
with that, you can clock out now.

00:10:37,156 --> 00:10:39,113
Am I clear?

00:10:40,284 --> 00:10:41,861
Clear.

00:11:36,048 --> 00:11:37,542
It couldn't be.

00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:42,296
<i>Corner of Paradise and Main...</i>

00:11:45,182 --> 00:11:47,091
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:11:47,226 --> 00:11:49,135
You have a daughter?

00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:52,771
Where are you going with this?

00:11:52,898 --> 00:11:56,101
Her prints are on airline stubs
relating to tonight's homicide.

00:11:57,569 --> 00:12:00,523
There's got to be more than one Ellie Brass
in the world.

00:12:00,656 --> 00:12:02,233
Ellie Rebecca Brass?

00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:04,240
DOB 9/24/82.

00:12:04,368 --> 00:12:09,030
Essex County, New Jersey.
Last known address: 554 Applegate Way.

00:12:09,164 --> 00:12:10,789
OK, you told me.

00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:15,459
- I got to bring her in.
- PD brings in suspects. I'll put Vega on it.

00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:17,414
You're hands-off?

00:12:17,548 --> 00:12:20,086
Of course.

00:12:23,512 --> 00:12:25,801
Just go in, right in there.

00:12:53,834 --> 00:12:55,412
I'm fine.

00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,289
I'm fine.

00:12:59,798 --> 00:13:03,001
So, we're gonna pick up
right where we left off, huh, Ellie?

00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:16,016
You still documenting the money
from the con man?

00:13:16,148 --> 00:13:19,065
Every serial number. Evidence.

00:13:19,193 --> 00:13:23,985
Did you know that 9T% of all 100-dollar bills
have traces of cocaine on them?

00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:26,107
I was the one that told you that.

00:13:26,241 --> 00:13:27,901
Oh, yeah.

00:13:31,663 --> 00:13:33,407
Hey, Ronnie.

00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,699
Do you know what the intaglio script is?

00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:38,242
The engraving on Ben Franklin's collar?

00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:42,881
I don't see it on this bill.

00:13:43,008 --> 00:13:44,716
Do you?

00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,097
Everyone I sleep with dies.

00:13:53,101 --> 00:13:54,264
Excuse me?

00:13:55,437 --> 00:13:58,391
I slept with this sailor once, when I was 14.

00:13:58,524 --> 00:14:00,516
He died overseas somewhere.

00:14:00,651 --> 00:14:04,102
What was your relationship to Vincent Avery?

00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,115
There was no relationship. I barely knew him.

00:14:08,242 --> 00:14:10,400
You knew him enough to fly to Baja with him.

00:14:10,536 --> 00:14:12,612
He invited me for the weekend.

00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:14,703
I figured as long as he didn't chop me up,

00:14:14,832 --> 00:14:16,705
I'd have some fun.

00:14:16,834 --> 00:14:18,577
Mind if I smoke?

00:14:20,838 --> 00:14:23,245
- Yeah.
- Plain sight.

00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:31,634
It's a dummy chip. No casino logo.

00:14:31,765 --> 00:14:35,763
Exactly the same kind of chips
Vincent Avery used to scam the casinos.

00:14:35,894 --> 00:14:38,266
Before he got shot.

00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:40,722
So, you two fly down to Baja,

00:14:40,858 --> 00:14:42,316
pose as a married couple,

00:14:42,443 --> 00:14:44,400
bring back a stomach-load of blow,

00:14:44,528 --> 00:14:46,521
and then you run chip scams?

00:14:46,655 --> 00:14:48,612
Who's taking your drug profits?

00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,445
Man, I wish I knew what you were talking about.

00:14:51,577 --> 00:14:55,111
- Someone catch you two working on the side?
- I wasn't even there.

00:14:55,247 --> 00:14:56,741
- Where were you?
- Home.

00:14:56,874 --> 00:14:59,910
- In the bathroom.
- She was passing pellets of cocaine.

00:15:00,043 --> 00:15:01,454
I'm outta here.

00:15:03,881 --> 00:15:05,838
Sit down!

00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,681
Thank you.

00:15:14,808 --> 00:15:17,478
With your permission,
we need to take some X-rays.

00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:19,767
So long as you're the one doing them.

00:15:19,897 --> 00:15:21,474
We'd also like to look at your car.

00:15:21,607 --> 00:15:24,643
- I lent it to my boyfriend.
- What is his name?

00:15:24,777 --> 00:15:28,644
You know, you have
this whole Lenny Kravitz thing going on.

00:15:30,407 --> 00:15:33,610
- I'm not one for brothers, but... damn!
- His name.

00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,702
Keith Driscoll.

00:15:38,832 --> 00:15:42,035
- Now you tell me to get involved.
- Evidence against her isn't good.

00:15:42,169 --> 00:15:44,838
Hey, listen. Nothing places her at the murder.

00:15:44,963 --> 00:15:48,130
She mules drugs for a guy who ends up dead
ten hours later?

00:15:48,258 --> 00:15:50,132
A BS chip scam? A lousy alibi?

00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:54,803
Vega's on it. He'll find your boyfriend.
If I know my daughter, that's your shooter.

00:15:54,932 --> 00:15:58,051
Brass, it's a big city.

00:15:58,185 --> 00:16:00,178
Boyfriend could disappear.

00:16:00,312 --> 00:16:03,017
But, hey, it's your kid.

00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:11,151
Left scope is a government-issued $100 bill.

00:16:11,281 --> 00:16:13,607
Right scope is the money from your tourists.

00:16:13,742 --> 00:16:15,865
It confirms what you saw with the naked eye.

00:16:15,994 --> 00:16:21,202
On a genuine bill "The United States Of
America" is written in micro-letters on the border

00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,958
of Ben Franklin's portrait.

00:16:23,085 --> 00:16:26,501
On the Ortons' bill,
the intaglio script is blurred out.

00:16:27,673 --> 00:16:31,208
Microprinting. A trick the Treasury
uses to thwart photocopying a US bill.

00:16:31,343 --> 00:16:37,381
What about pigmentation? Treasury seals
and serial numbers... are the same colour, right?

00:16:37,516 --> 00:16:40,268
They are on the bill on your left.

00:16:40,394 --> 00:16:44,392
So the numbers on the right
didn't hold the green ink

00:16:44,523 --> 00:16:46,681
No printer on the market can make a true green.

00:16:46,817 --> 00:16:48,893
Blue and yellow hues always bleed in.

00:16:49,027 --> 00:16:50,854
Our monetary system depends on it.

00:16:52,364 --> 00:16:54,357
Who do we notify? The Treasury?

00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:57,196
Secret Service Branch.
They have a field office in Vegas.

00:16:57,327 --> 00:16:59,403
I'll put these back in the evidence room.

00:17:01,373 --> 00:17:06,368
Wait till the Ortons find out
what we do with counterfeit money.

00:17:17,556 --> 00:17:20,094
Nothing.

00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:21,767
Told you I was clean.

00:17:21,894 --> 00:17:24,135
So, you gave up your drugs to your boss, huh?

00:17:24,271 --> 00:17:25,386
Boss?

00:17:25,522 --> 00:17:28,689
Do you realise,
every time you ingest one of those pellets,

00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:30,395
you risk dying of an overdose?

00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:35,273
Only if I eat.
Releases gastric acids. Blah, blah, blah.

00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:36,901
So, you can just not eat.

00:17:37,034 --> 00:17:40,948
You see, the thing with me is,
I'm... mind over matter.

00:17:42,706 --> 00:17:46,075
I can imagine a hamburger and... I'm full.

00:17:49,671 --> 00:17:51,664
Will you fill me up, Warrick?

00:17:57,262 --> 00:17:59,255
I don't think I can handle this.

00:17:59,389 --> 00:18:02,177
- I gotta call Grissom.
- Then call him.

00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:04,467
But?

00:18:04,603 --> 00:18:07,521
- I didn't say anything.
- I heard it, bro, a "but" in there.

00:18:07,648 --> 00:18:10,898
You know how Grissom is.
If you ask him for the keys to the car,

00:18:11,026 --> 00:18:13,434
he's gonna ask you
if you've done your homework.

00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,812
Yeah. That's what I was thinking.

00:18:15,948 --> 00:18:19,862
It's like a multiple-choice question. You know?
You go with your first choice.

00:18:19,993 --> 00:18:22,200
- Sack up.
- Sack up.

00:18:31,088 --> 00:18:33,080
(Cellphone rings)

00:18:37,469 --> 00:18:39,462
So did Warrick tell you to call me?

00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:41,553
You think you're my only friend in the PD?

00:18:41,682 --> 00:18:43,840
I'm just telling you to be careful.

00:18:43,976 --> 00:18:46,301
Am I supposed to hold my breath
and count to ten?

00:18:46,437 --> 00:18:50,351
Hey, look. We all get a little crazy
when our kids are involved.

00:18:50,482 --> 00:18:53,187
Look, I'm on the job. It's standard police work.

00:18:53,318 --> 00:18:55,525
Enjoy Reno. I got this.

00:18:55,654 --> 00:18:58,227
OK. Hey, but listen, if you find the boyfriend,

00:18:58,365 --> 00:18:59,824
don't go it alone

00:19:02,828 --> 00:19:04,488
Don't worry, I won't.

00:19:05,831 --> 00:19:07,491
Dispatch. Navaho 4-1-9-7.

00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:11,742
In pursuit of a '78 red Camaro.
Suspect wanted for questioning.

00:19:15,466 --> 00:19:18,039
(Tyres screech)

00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:20,711
(Car horn blares)

00:19:40,741 --> 00:19:42,401
Which one's Keith Driscoll?

00:19:42,534 --> 00:19:45,535
I was just hitchhiking.
I told the guy to let me out.

00:19:45,662 --> 00:19:47,536
Get lost.

00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:50,457
OK come on! Out!

00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:53,585
- Easy, man!
- I'm only gonna ask you once.

00:19:53,712 --> 00:19:56,084
- What are you and Ellie into?
- What do you mean?

00:19:56,215 --> 00:19:59,584
You got her muling drugs from Mexico.
You got her mixed up in a homicide.

00:19:59,718 --> 00:20:03,586
You got it backwards, man.
She turned me on to coke so I could stud for her.

00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:07,475
You can't just shoot me, man.

00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:09,428
(Sirens)

00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:17,270
Brass.

00:20:17,402 --> 00:20:18,945
Yo, Jim.

00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:21,147
- We got it.
- Everything's cool.

00:20:21,281 --> 00:20:24,235
This guy was gonna kill me, man.
He pulled his gun.

00:20:24,368 --> 00:20:26,775
I'm sure the officer felt
his life was in danger, sir.

00:20:26,912 --> 00:20:29,664
We wanna question you
about the murder of Vincent Avery.

00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,455
- I'm not riding with him.
- You're right, you're not.

00:20:50,227 --> 00:20:53,810
What do you mean, you can't give it back?
It's all we have for our vacation.

00:20:53,939 --> 00:20:57,390
Well, it's counterfeit.
We have to take it out of circulation.

00:20:57,526 --> 00:20:59,400
What?

00:21:00,571 --> 00:21:04,355
Mr Orton, you don't look so surprised.

00:21:04,491 --> 00:21:05,820
Matt? Honey?

00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:09,534
I went to the gas station. The attendant said
the hundred I had was phoney.

00:21:09,663 --> 00:21:11,988
So I went to our branch bank here

00:21:12,124 --> 00:21:14,829
and I tried to exchange it,
but they couldn't do it.

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,421
I mean, why would anybody turn in bad money
if they can't get reimbursed for it?

00:21:19,548 --> 00:21:22,715
Because it's in violation of Title 18, Section 473

00:21:22,843 --> 00:21:24,586
of the United States Code,

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,385
punishable by up to 15 years
for knowingly passing on bad money.

00:21:28,515 --> 00:21:32,015
- Oh, my God!
- I just didn't wanna get stuck holding the bag.

00:21:32,144 --> 00:21:33,519
Do you have a $20 bill?

00:21:34,688 --> 00:21:36,266
Our wallets are up in the room.

00:21:36,398 --> 00:21:37,940
I may have something.

00:21:39,193 --> 00:21:41,102
Hm. You see the ghost?

00:21:42,404 --> 00:21:45,109
Right there on the right.

00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,692
- Oh, yeah.
- They're embedded to prevent forgeries.

00:21:48,827 --> 00:21:53,205
You should see Lincoln on the five.
He looks really stressed out.

00:21:53,332 --> 00:21:55,241
I wish I had met you last week.

00:21:55,375 --> 00:22:00,962
A special agent from Secret Service wants to
talk to you about the final deposition of this case.

00:22:08,472 --> 00:22:10,014
Warrick Brown?

00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,299
Special Agent Beckman, Treasury Department.

00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:14,059
- Subbing in tonight, right?
- Treasury Department?

00:22:14,186 --> 00:22:17,519
We wanted to be sure CSI's on the same page
on this counterfeit case.

00:22:17,648 --> 00:22:20,732
- Counterfeit?
- Our lab wants to analyse that money too.

00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:23,564
- What money?
- I didn't wanna interrupt you.

00:22:23,695 --> 00:22:26,365
- On a federal case.
- Agent Beckman,

00:22:26,448 --> 00:22:29,022
I'm Sara Sidle
Could you excuse us for a minute?

00:22:31,411 --> 00:22:36,654
Warrick, you gotta turn on your pager, man.
I got Brass's daughter's car in the garage.

00:22:36,792 --> 00:22:39,959
- I'm dealing with something.
- That's why I didn't bring this to you.

00:22:40,087 --> 00:22:43,538
Vega says we won't be able to hold the suspect
for more than a half-hour.

00:22:43,674 --> 00:22:45,417
Did Sidle hold back information?

00:22:45,551 --> 00:22:47,543
I didn't not tell him.

00:22:47,678 --> 00:22:51,011
- I ran with the case. I do it with Grissom.
- Well, I'm not Grissom!

00:22:52,224 --> 00:22:54,430
Guys.

00:22:55,394 --> 00:22:57,552
I didn't say it.

00:22:59,982 --> 00:23:05,771
Sara, brief Special Agent Beckman
on the funny money. Nick, garage.

00:23:10,617 --> 00:23:13,155
<i>THE CHAMBERS BROTHERS:
Time Has Come Today</i>

00:23:14,955 --> 00:23:16,948
<i>Young hearts can go that way</i>

00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:21,918
<i>Can't put it off another day</i>

00:23:23,046 --> 00:23:25,716
<i>I don't care what others say</i>

00:23:26,758 --> 00:23:29,166
<i>They say we don't listen anyway</i>

00:23:29,303 --> 00:23:31,509
<i>Time has come today</i>

00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:44,609
<i>Oh, the rules have changed today</i>

00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:48,108
<i>I have no place to stay</i>

00:23:49,114 --> 00:23:50,229
<i>Hey!</i>

00:23:50,365 --> 00:23:52,572
<i>Thinking about the subway</i>

00:23:52,701 --> 00:23:53,697
<i>Hey!</i>

00:23:53,827 --> 00:23:55,820
<i>The love has flown away</i>

00:23:55,954 --> 00:23:57,497
<i>Hey!</i>

00:23:57,623 --> 00:24:00,410
<i>My tears have come and gone</i>

00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:01,491
<i>Hey!</i>

00:24:01,627 --> 00:24:04,200
<i>Oh, my Lord, I have to roam</i>

00:24:04,338 --> 00:24:05,251
<i>Hey!</i>

00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,254
<i>I have no home</i>

00:24:07,382 --> 00:24:08,545
<i>Hey!</i>

00:24:08,675 --> 00:24:10,668
<i>I have no home</i>

00:24:12,095 --> 00:24:13,638
<i>Hey!</i>

00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:20,228
Tyre plug.

00:24:20,354 --> 00:24:22,014
That's a nail in sheep's clothing.

00:24:24,608 --> 00:24:26,980
Treads from the crime scene.

00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:31,938
The void on the one-to-one
matches the void on Ellie's left rear tyre.

00:24:32,074 --> 00:24:34,113
Siamese twins.

00:24:34,243 --> 00:24:37,908
Proves one thing.
This was the getaway car used in the murder.

00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:39,449
Yeah.

00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:43,953
We printed the vehicle
your client was found driving.

00:24:44,086 --> 00:24:47,455
It puts the car at the scene of Avery's murder
less than 12 hours ago.

00:24:47,589 --> 00:24:51,208
Come off it. The car's not even registered to him.

00:24:51,343 --> 00:24:53,300
No. The girl he bought tickets to Baja for.

00:24:53,428 --> 00:24:55,088
He bought tickets for Avery as well.

00:24:55,222 --> 00:25:00,180
The tickets were bought with your credit card,
but we have no proof he ever went down there.

00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,268
- He's generous
- Till Avery made him mad.

00:25:02,396 --> 00:25:05,812
You wanna talk about the gun
your captain pulled on my client?

00:25:05,941 --> 00:25:09,559
An unarmed man.
That's got PD brutality written all over it.

00:25:09,695 --> 00:25:11,319
Vega?

00:25:11,447 --> 00:25:13,938
Safety precaution only.

00:25:16,535 --> 00:25:19,108
- We're done.
- Let's go.

00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:29,457
You suspect them
of a high-end counterfeit operation?

00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,341
No, but it did get me thinking.

00:25:32,468 --> 00:25:34,959
If something doesn't feel right, it probably isn't.

00:25:35,095 --> 00:25:38,013
Take a look. This is the money
that we got from the con man.

00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,094
See the serial numbers?
Each one is different.

00:25:46,857 --> 00:25:50,142
- Just like real money.
- That's what threw Ronnie and I off the scent.

00:25:50,277 --> 00:25:54,489
This couple didn't make one bill and run
100 copies with the same serial number.

00:26:01,288 --> 00:26:03,613
They had to burn separate plates
for each number.

00:26:08,921 --> 00:26:10,913
Much harder to catch.

00:26:11,632 --> 00:26:13,423
The very high end.

00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,590
The Duffys are major counterfeiters.

00:26:15,719 --> 00:26:17,712
You mean the Ortons.

00:26:17,846 --> 00:26:21,381
My investigators tell me they're the Duffys
from Las Vegas County.

00:26:21,517 --> 00:26:22,927
Orton's their assumed names.

00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,803
How long have you known that?

00:26:24,937 --> 00:26:27,143
I went on the T-Department database.

00:26:27,272 --> 00:26:31,104
They've each done time for fraud.
And, yes, high-end counterfeiting.

00:26:31,235 --> 00:26:34,271
- You federal guys are sneaky.
- Access.

00:26:34,404 --> 00:26:36,563
So, what do you wanna do with the money?

00:26:36,698 --> 00:26:40,364
It's your money now. Well, the Treasury's.

00:26:42,162 --> 00:26:44,155
Thanks. I'll take it from here.

00:26:44,289 --> 00:26:46,578
Find the operation and shut it down.

00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:48,666
Hey!

00:26:49,753 --> 00:26:52,588
- I'm still part of this.
- Not really.

00:26:52,714 --> 00:26:55,585
But you're making me look good,
so if you wanna tag along...

00:26:55,717 --> 00:26:58,588
- I don't tag along.
- Suit yourself.

00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:07,844
We got bad news from the garage

00:27:09,022 --> 00:27:10,517
Give it to me.

00:27:10,649 --> 00:27:13,603
The tyre evidence
puts Ellie's car at the murder scene.

00:27:13,735 --> 00:27:17,733
- We'll be pressing charges for Avery's murder.
- Come on. You know she didn't kill him.

00:27:17,865 --> 00:27:21,234
- Keith Driscoll did.
- Maybe so, but we don't have Driscoll.

00:27:21,368 --> 00:27:24,737
- What?
- Vega had to let him go after your gun episode.

00:27:24,872 --> 00:27:27,908
Oh, I get it.
Vega thinks she'll eventually rat out Driscoll.

00:27:28,041 --> 00:27:33,166
- That's what you cops think.
- Let me tell you something about my daughter.

00:27:33,297 --> 00:27:34,625
Never happen.

00:27:49,521 --> 00:27:52,273
- Are they arresting me?
- I'm gonna bail you out.

00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:55,358
You can stay at my place.

00:27:55,486 --> 00:27:56,861
I have a place.

00:27:56,987 --> 00:27:58,565
You have a place?

00:27:58,697 --> 00:28:02,196
Keith and I do. We share everything.

00:28:07,956 --> 00:28:12,286
Ellie, why do you do this to yourself?
You're better than that.

00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:14,412
You're better than him.

00:28:14,546 --> 00:28:16,705
No, I'm not.

00:28:31,438 --> 00:28:33,431
(Phone rings)

00:28:42,324 --> 00:28:45,527
Grissom's office. CSI. Warrick speaking.

00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:48,330
Warrick it's Vega. I got a 444.

00:28:48,413 --> 00:28:51,367
Officer involved shooting? Who?

00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,493
One guess.

00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,902
You've just bounced off the glass ceiling.

00:29:29,037 --> 00:29:30,697
Excuse me?

00:29:30,831 --> 00:29:35,540
Brass buys his daughter a get-out-of-jail-free
card and her boyfriend ends up on a gurney.

00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:39,370
Ecklie, you're Day shift,
and you're here because...?

00:29:39,506 --> 00:29:42,176
- I'm dedicated.
- Yeah. Picture that.

00:29:45,971 --> 00:29:48,129
- What happened?
- Driscoll shot in the throat.

00:29:48,265 --> 00:29:53,260
First officer here found Brass in the apartment,
woozy. Keith Driscoll on the floor, lights out.

00:29:53,395 --> 00:29:57,227
- Where's his daughter?
- No-one knows. I got guys looking for her.

00:29:57,357 --> 00:29:59,848
- Check his weapon?
- Waiting on you guys.

00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:26,284
There's one round missing.

00:30:36,637 --> 00:30:39,306
It's just you and me talking now, Jim.

00:30:39,389 --> 00:30:41,133
Off the record

00:30:41,266 --> 00:30:43,583
You went to the apartment?

00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,096
Yeah.

00:30:45,222 --> 00:30:47,594
- You notify Dispatch?
- It was a personal visit.

00:30:47,724 --> 00:30:51,307
- But you went looking for Keith Driscoll.
- No.

00:30:51,436 --> 00:30:53,429
I went looking for Ellie.

00:30:55,524 --> 00:30:56,899
Where is she?

00:30:58,068 --> 00:31:01,069
- Where is she?
- She's not here. Hey, you got a warrant?

00:31:04,783 --> 00:31:07,072
Everything's a blur after that.

00:31:07,202 --> 00:31:09,195
Do you remember drawing your gun?

00:31:09,329 --> 00:31:11,405
No.

00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,209
You're leaving something out.

00:31:16,086 --> 00:31:18,577
Hey, you got a warrant?

00:31:19,881 --> 00:31:22,088
Ellie, are you here?

00:31:22,801 --> 00:31:25,588
- I'm not leaving anything out.
- Your daughter lives there.

00:31:25,721 --> 00:31:29,635
She probably saw what happened.
We're gonna pick her up eventually.

00:31:31,184 --> 00:31:33,177
Careful. She spits.

00:31:38,525 --> 00:31:40,268
One shot?

00:31:40,402 --> 00:31:43,486
15 bullets left in Brass's gun.
There should be 16.

00:31:43,613 --> 00:31:47,148
What cop doesn't empty his magazine?
They're trained to shoot to kill.

00:31:58,712 --> 00:32:00,455
Hey!

00:32:02,716 --> 00:32:05,124
Look where I just located this blood.

00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,340
- The back of the grip.
- Novices get their hands pinched in the slide.

00:32:11,266 --> 00:32:12,464
Slide bite

00:32:13,644 --> 00:32:15,636
Man.

00:32:15,771 --> 00:32:17,929
Brass didn't shoot this guy.

00:32:18,065 --> 00:32:20,057
I need you to show me your hands.

00:32:20,192 --> 00:32:23,561
You're testing for gunshot residue?
It's a little late for that.

00:32:23,695 --> 00:32:25,355
Your hands, Captain.

00:32:30,911 --> 00:32:32,702
Satisfied?

00:32:32,829 --> 00:32:34,869
I'm gonna need to take your badge.

00:32:34,998 --> 00:32:37,668
It's not your job to take my stripes.

00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:39,957
In this case, it is.

00:32:40,087 --> 00:32:43,372
- Detective Vega.
- No.

00:32:57,187 --> 00:33:01,351
AB Dick 4910. 11 x 14 offsets.

00:33:01,483 --> 00:33:05,812
This is the Rolls-Royce of printers.
The closest thing to what the government uses.

00:33:05,946 --> 00:33:07,938
Multiple inks.

00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:10,564
Disaperf computer paper.

00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:13,571
Heavy rag. 25% content. Makes for durability.

00:33:13,704 --> 00:33:16,658
Mr Duffy, can Agent Beckman and I
see your burn plates, please?

00:33:30,637 --> 00:33:32,760
Press, ink, paper, burn plates.

00:33:33,724 --> 00:33:35,550
Only question now is

00:33:35,684 --> 00:33:37,677
where's the money...

00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,722
...Mr and Mrs Duffy?

00:33:43,525 --> 00:33:45,233
There isn't any.

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,022
Oh, come on. You can print a million dollars
a day with this operation. Where is it?

00:33:50,157 --> 00:33:52,445
- There is no money.
- Excuse me?

00:33:55,162 --> 00:33:56,989
I don't get this. Beckman...

00:33:57,122 --> 00:33:58,913
Congratulations, Sidle.

00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:01,366
- You passed.
- Passed?

00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:04,075
Duffy is their code alias.

00:34:04,212 --> 00:34:09,207
This is Special Agent Conners,
Special Agent Tessari. We're all with Service.

00:34:09,343 --> 00:34:12,628
- I don't...
- We put bait money in the hands of bad people.

00:34:12,763 --> 00:34:14,921
In this case, a reputed con.

00:34:15,057 --> 00:34:17,808
To see how the money
leads to law enforcement.

00:34:17,934 --> 00:34:21,802
- What if Vincent Avery wasn't murdered?
- Murder wasn't on the agenda.

00:34:21,938 --> 00:34:25,806
However, in light of unpredictable events,
the sting still upheld.

00:34:25,942 --> 00:34:29,394
It came to you and you didn't take.
You should be very proud.

00:34:29,529 --> 00:34:32,199
Wow. I don't feel that at all.

00:34:32,282 --> 00:34:34,275
It never feels right when it works.

00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:37,079
Only feels wrong when it doesn't.

00:34:37,204 --> 00:34:40,703
First, I have the saliva sample
taken from Captain Brass's badge.

00:34:40,832 --> 00:34:42,825
Better known as Ellie's DNA.

00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:44,952
Take a good look at her markers.

00:34:45,087 --> 00:34:48,088
Second, blood sample from Jim Brass.

00:34:48,215 --> 00:34:50,622
They're nothing alike.

00:34:50,759 --> 00:34:54,543
From parent to child, seven of thirteen markers
should match up. Minimum.

00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,135
In this case,
there's not one marker in common.

00:34:57,265 --> 00:34:59,472
I don't have Ellie's mother's DNA on file,

00:34:59,601 --> 00:35:01,808
- but my guess is...
- Was she adopted?

00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:07,149
Whew!

00:35:07,275 --> 00:35:09,268
What about the blood on Brass's gun?

00:35:09,403 --> 00:35:11,395
Not Brass's. Not Ellie's.

00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,024
Not Ellie's?

00:35:13,156 --> 00:35:15,232
No, or her boyfriend Keith Driscoll.

00:35:16,368 --> 00:35:18,325
You still got a shooter out there.

00:35:18,453 --> 00:35:20,529
With a pinch on his hand.

00:35:22,124 --> 00:35:24,875
All right. Where's that manifest?

00:35:29,923 --> 00:35:31,916
Vincent Avery.

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,677
2034.

00:35:40,475 --> 00:35:42,018
2034.

00:35:48,692 --> 00:35:50,483
Marty Gilmore.

00:35:57,701 --> 00:36:00,026
(Siren)

00:36:01,872 --> 00:36:03,745
Hold it, hold it.

00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:07,411
The game's over, Marty.

00:36:08,337 --> 00:36:10,246
The hitchhiker.

00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,251
- You know this guy?
- Yean we met

00:36:13,383 --> 00:36:15,506
When the three of you got back from Baja.

00:36:15,636 --> 00:36:17,178
You conned the Captain.

00:36:19,014 --> 00:36:21,339
I gotta shake your hand.

00:36:21,475 --> 00:36:23,551
- This a joke?
- No, on the real.

00:36:31,735 --> 00:36:33,774
You shot Driscoll.

00:36:35,072 --> 00:36:37,907
- With his firearm.
- That was you in the other room.

00:36:40,077 --> 00:36:41,986
I think I killed him.

00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,790
- Nope. He killed you.
(Gunshot)

00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,785
Urgh!

00:36:54,007 --> 00:36:57,922
So, you offed Driscoll to take over his drug op.

00:36:58,053 --> 00:36:59,761
What about Ellie?

00:37:00,847 --> 00:37:04,892
She's supposed to be in jail
for shooting Avery at the casino.

00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,312
- Urgh!
- You eat something?

00:37:08,438 --> 00:37:10,431
I took a laxative.

00:37:10,565 --> 00:37:13,816
Oh, God. He's gonna OD.

00:37:13,944 --> 00:37:15,272
Can we get a medic?

00:37:16,905 --> 00:37:18,779
Can we get a medic?

00:37:19,991 --> 00:37:20,940
Brass!

00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,870
Yeah.

00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:27,452
I need Rescue,

00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:32,534
826 Herrick Lane. Overdose.
Send an ambulance.

00:37:32,671 --> 00:37:34,331
Oh, my God. I'm gonna die.

00:37:34,464 --> 00:37:38,248
No, worse. You're gonna live.

00:37:47,727 --> 00:37:50,563
Brass! Hang on.

00:37:55,902 --> 00:37:58,191
I only took it to get Ellie's DNA off of it.

00:37:58,321 --> 00:37:59,899
That's it.

00:38:00,991 --> 00:38:02,983
A man's gotta do...

00:38:05,453 --> 00:38:07,363
What is it, Rick?

00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:11,031
We were checking out the blood from your gun.

00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:14,916
- We compared your DNA to her DNA.
- Yeah?

00:38:15,046 --> 00:38:18,250
You never said anything
about her being adopted.

00:38:24,556 --> 00:38:26,180
She's not.

00:38:27,684 --> 00:38:29,427
Call it the mailman.

00:38:32,439 --> 00:38:34,431
Ellie doesn't know.

00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,629
Ellie?

00:39:00,842 --> 00:39:03,084
How did you find me?

00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,793
I'm a detective.

00:39:08,517 --> 00:39:11,767
I heard you never went back
to Driscoll's apartment that night.

00:39:11,895 --> 00:39:14,386
It's true.

00:39:14,523 --> 00:39:17,274
I could have sworn
I heard you in that other room.

00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,393
No, Dad.

00:39:19,528 --> 00:39:22,778
I was never there. Never.

00:39:23,907 --> 00:39:26,742
I guess I've been doing that
since you've been born.

00:39:26,868 --> 00:39:30,071
I mean, I know I was never around, but...

00:39:32,582 --> 00:39:34,575
You know, no matter where I am...

00:39:37,629 --> 00:39:39,622
...no matter what I'm doing...

00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,333
...I always think that you're there.

00:39:46,471 --> 00:39:48,464
Even if you're not.

00:39:49,975 --> 00:39:52,810
Come back to me, Ellie.

00:39:57,482 --> 00:39:59,274
Dad...

00:39:59,401 --> 00:40:01,393
it's way too late.

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,193
I've got to catch a flight to Jersey.

00:40:09,327 --> 00:40:11,320
Midnight.

00:40:11,454 --> 00:40:13,412
Mom says...

00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,532
I can stay with her... a while.

00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:18,205
Sure. OK.

00:40:18,336 --> 00:40:21,622
You need a ride to the airport?
I can get you there fast.

00:40:21,756 --> 00:40:23,548
Thanks.

00:40:23,675 --> 00:40:25,668
I'm taking the shuttle, so...

00:40:25,802 --> 00:40:27,795
Oh, yeah. Right. OK.

00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:36,228
Catch you later.

00:40:46,072 --> 00:40:48,065
- Hey, Sara.
- Hey.

00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,860
Hey.

00:40:49,993 --> 00:40:52,401
I'm short on cash.
Can you loan me a hundred?

00:40:52,537 --> 00:40:54,530
Funny. Very funny.

00:40:54,664 --> 00:40:56,657
Oh! Look, shift's over.

00:40:56,791 --> 00:40:58,784
Guess you're one of us again.

00:41:07,844 --> 00:41:09,837
Hey Griss!

00:41:09,971 --> 00:41:12,758
- How did it go?
- The seminar was fine.

00:41:12,891 --> 00:41:16,260
Every one of my roaches got stage fright.

00:41:16,394 --> 00:41:18,601
They came in fourth, third, second...

00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,723
and dead last.

00:41:20,857 --> 00:41:22,684
How about you? How did you do?

00:41:22,817 --> 00:41:26,601
Well, the job is fine.
It's the other stuff, the personalities.

00:41:26,738 --> 00:41:29,443
I love mankind, it's people I can't stand?

00:41:29,574 --> 00:41:31,567
- Who's that? Einstein?
- Linus.

00:41:31,701 --> 00:41:33,409
Charlie Brown. Figures.

00:41:33,537 --> 00:41:35,280
Is that why you put me in charge?

00:41:35,413 --> 00:41:37,453
You think I like dealing with people?

00:41:37,582 --> 00:41:39,785
Remember you asked me
what I was in high school?

00:41:39,785 --> 00:41:41,279
Yeah. You said "a ghost".

00:41:41,412 --> 00:41:44,781
When I leave CSI, there won't be cake
in the break room. I'll be gone.

00:41:44,915 --> 00:41:47,786
So I wanted to see if you could step in.

00:41:47,918 --> 00:41:50,041
Tell me.

00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:52,626
All of it. From the top.

00:41:52,756 --> 00:41:54,381
From the top?

00:42:01,932 --> 00:42:03,925
I don't know where to start.

00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:06,052
It was wild.
