00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:44,197
Mom! Mom!

00:00:44,264 --> 00:00:48,268
The dirt burned my hand!

00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,241
( <i>siren blipping</i> )

00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,461
What's HazMat doing here?

00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:02,930
Kid's playing tag,
takes a header in the dirt

00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:05,132
ends up with first-degree
on his hands.

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,034
Wait. We got a call
about a dead body.

00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:09,604
Yeah, I'm getting there.
So, HazMat arrives

00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,206
figuring some sort
of chemical spill.

00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:15,810
Starts removing
the toxic soil, and bam

00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:19,347
a shovel slams
into a shoulder blade.

00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:21,927
SIDLE:
Clothing's been
reduced to shreds.

00:01:21,994 --> 00:01:24,875
Epidermal tissue.
is virtually gone.

00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,076
The body's desiccated.

00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,834
GRISSOM:
Viscous fluid the consistency
of dishwashing soap.

00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,810
HazMat guy was right.

00:01:32,877 --> 00:01:35,146
Killer doused
the body in lye.

00:01:35,212 --> 00:01:37,815
Must have thought
it would destroy the body.

00:01:37,882 --> 00:01:39,984
Yeah, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,686

Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I need
to neutralize the soil.

00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,133
If you touch the soil

00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,902
you're going to contaminate
my crime scene

00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:27,670
but I'll let you know
when I'm finished.

00:02:27,737 --> 00:02:29,739
Okay.

00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:36,012
What'd you get?

00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,880
Vic's wallet, what's left of it.

00:02:37,947 --> 00:02:40,550
It's a Nevada license.
Bob Martin.

00:02:40,617 --> 00:02:42,418
31. He lived downtown.

00:02:42,485 --> 00:02:44,287
There's 20 bucks in the flap.

00:02:44,354 --> 00:02:45,421
Rules out robbery.

00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,205
Look at this.

00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:07,310
Looks like a paint fleck
or metal chip, maybe.

00:03:07,377 --> 00:03:08,845
What'd the Ranger say?

00:03:08,911 --> 00:03:14,083
Nobody saw anything suspicious.
Park closes up at 10:00 p.m.

00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,152
No security,
minimal lighting.

00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:18,655
Basically, a pretty good place
to dump a body.

00:03:18,721 --> 00:03:20,823
You found this guy
in the park?

00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,725
Actually,
HazMat found him.

00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:26,129
Well, that explains the
postmortem scar tissue.

00:03:26,195 --> 00:03:28,231
Lye had a field day
on his flesh.

00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:33,770
( <i>sizzling</i> )

00:03:33,836 --> 00:03:35,004
Time of death?

00:03:35,071 --> 00:03:36,906
Approximately 24 hours ago.

00:03:36,973 --> 00:03:38,508
Tell me about the car.

00:03:38,574 --> 00:03:39,509
Car?

00:03:39,575 --> 00:03:41,444
What car?

00:03:41,511 --> 00:03:43,613
Comminuted fractures

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,417
of the proximal tib-fib.
Both legs.

00:03:47,483 --> 00:03:49,152
Bumper hits right
below the knees.

00:03:49,218 --> 00:03:50,620
Sure sign he was hit by a car.

00:03:53,122 --> 00:03:55,858
Look at all the bruising.

00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:58,761
If he was struck and killed,
ecchymosis would be nonexistent.

00:03:58,828 --> 00:04:01,164
Which suggests he survived
the impact.

00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,231
Usual injuries.

00:04:02,298 --> 00:04:05,201
Ruptured patellar tendon

00:04:05,268 --> 00:04:07,203
laceration
of the saphenous vein

00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,639
and multiple incised wounds
containing slivers of glass

00:04:09,706 --> 00:04:14,777
which I will send over to Trace

00:04:14,844 --> 00:04:17,547
and bruises:
legs, arms and chest.

00:04:17,614 --> 00:04:20,950
What I didn't find
was arterial lacerations

00:04:21,017 --> 00:04:23,219
or underlying vessel damage.

00:04:23,286 --> 00:04:24,954
Confirms death wasn't immediate?

00:04:25,021 --> 00:04:25,989
Correct.

00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:28,825
Victim was like
a leaky water balloon.

00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:31,794
Heart slowly pumped blood
right out of his body

00:04:31,861 --> 00:04:34,464
and based on the coloration
of the bruises

00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,032
trauma was sustained

00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:38,868
approximately 48 hours
before death.

00:04:40,503 --> 00:04:43,306
Three days ago,
this man was injured.

00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:45,508
He bled out
until he died yesterday.

00:04:45,575 --> 00:04:47,510
We didn't find any blood.

00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,851
Lockwood?

00:04:54,917 --> 00:04:56,319
Hey, Stokes.

00:04:56,386 --> 00:04:58,388
Who called it in?

00:04:58,454 --> 00:04:59,455
BLM chopper pilot.

00:04:59,522 --> 00:05:01,424
They always buzz Diablo Canyon

00:05:01,491 --> 00:05:03,960
looking for hikers
in distress. Or worse.

00:05:04,027 --> 00:05:06,029
He see anyone else
in the vicinity?

00:05:06,095 --> 00:05:08,932
No, just the vic:
Stacy Warner, 26.

00:05:08,998 --> 00:05:10,600
Las Vegas resident.

00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:12,368
I scanned
for a Missing Persons on her.

00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:14,203
Nothing.

00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:20,143
No tire treads.

00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:21,311
Whose are these?

00:05:21,377 --> 00:05:22,412
Paramedics and mine.

00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:24,814
Same path.
Walked straight in,
straight out.

00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:31,120
Engagement ring,
no wedding band.

00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:44,601
Orbital bone
looks fractured.

00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:47,036
Could have lost her footing
and hit her head.

00:05:47,103 --> 00:05:48,371
Could've.

00:05:48,438 --> 00:05:50,840
Hold that for me?

00:06:08,157 --> 00:06:09,525
Down feather.

00:06:09,592 --> 00:06:12,228
But she's not wearing a jacket.

00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:18,534
Shine that right here.

00:06:32,282 --> 00:06:35,018
Grissom should enjoy this.

00:06:35,084 --> 00:06:36,619
Hey, Lockwood

00:06:36,686 --> 00:06:38,321
you got any food
in your vehicle?

00:06:38,388 --> 00:06:39,923
Hamburger, anything like that?

00:06:39,989 --> 00:06:41,758
Gum, sugar-free.

00:06:41,824 --> 00:06:44,193
No, gum'll kill him.

00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,296
I'll stop at the
first place I see

00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:48,231
pick up some jerky.

00:06:48,298 --> 00:06:51,501
Will you get me a sample
of the ground

00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:52,602
underneath the body?

00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:54,671
Soon as the Coroner moves her.

00:06:54,737 --> 00:06:56,606
Good.

00:06:59,943 --> 00:07:01,644
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:07:01,711 --> 00:07:02,645
Bob is dead?

00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:05,081
His body was found
at Sunset Park.

00:07:05,148 --> 00:07:07,250
His license gave
this address.

00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:09,919
Are you his domestic partner?

00:07:09,986 --> 00:07:11,254
We're roommates.

00:07:11,321 --> 00:07:13,289
I got divorced
last year.

00:07:13,356 --> 00:07:15,558
And about six months ago,
Bob's wife kicked him out.

00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:16,826
He needed a place
to crash

00:07:16,893 --> 00:07:18,595
and I needed help
with the mortgage.

00:07:18,661 --> 00:07:20,830
He's two months late
on the rent.

00:07:20,897 --> 00:07:24,534
How do I go about collecting
under the circumstances?

00:07:28,338 --> 00:07:30,039
Look, we were roommates.

00:07:30,106 --> 00:07:32,008
We weren't really friends.

00:07:32,075 --> 00:07:33,309
When was the last time
you saw him?

00:07:33,376 --> 00:07:34,711
We both work at the Tangiers.

00:07:34,777 --> 00:07:37,280
He managed the restaurant,
and I work in maintenance.

00:07:37,347 --> 00:07:38,915
Last Monday
we drove in together.

00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:40,416
But you didn't drive home
together?

00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:41,517
Mondays? No.

00:07:41,584 --> 00:07:44,988
After shift, he'd walk over
to the university.

00:07:45,054 --> 00:07:46,589
He's an amateur photographer.

00:07:46,656 --> 00:07:47,590
Take the bus home.

00:07:47,657 --> 00:07:49,826
But he didn't come home
Monday night...

00:07:49,892 --> 00:07:51,294
I didn't think much of it.

00:07:51,361 --> 00:07:53,529
He's always going
back and forth
with Charlotte.

00:07:53,596 --> 00:07:55,031
His wife.

00:07:55,098 --> 00:07:56,466
What do I care?

00:07:56,532 --> 00:07:59,035
As long as
the rent's paid.

00:08:08,444 --> 00:08:10,113
Photo Department
kept a log.

00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:12,715
Bob Martin reserved
a darkroom on Mondays

00:08:12,782 --> 00:08:14,284
from 10:00 to 11:00 p.m.

00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,185
He was logged in
Monday night.

00:08:16,252 --> 00:08:17,654
Good. We got
a bus to catch.

00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:20,723
( <i>tires screech</i> )

00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:26,529
He left these photos behind.

00:08:26,596 --> 00:08:27,697
They're all of the same woman.

00:08:27,764 --> 00:08:30,233
I bet it's his wife.

00:08:51,054 --> 00:08:53,156
Silver flecks...

00:08:53,222 --> 00:08:55,124
like the one you found
at the body.

00:08:58,595 --> 00:09:02,832
I got a piece of plastic.

00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:04,767
Looks like a headlight cover,
maybe.

00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:08,471
This could be our crime scene.

00:09:11,574 --> 00:09:14,043
( <i>tires screech</i> )

00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,812
Assuming this was a hit-and-run

00:09:15,878 --> 00:09:18,214
how does a guy
with two broken legs end up

00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:21,651
on the other side of town buried
in a park, covered in lye?

00:09:25,788 --> 00:09:27,757
What are you looking for?

00:09:27,824 --> 00:09:29,759
No sign of blood.

00:09:29,826 --> 00:09:32,729
No evidence of a cleanup.

00:09:32,795 --> 00:09:34,731
If this is our crime scene

00:09:34,797 --> 00:09:38,001
then somewhere between here
and Sunset Park

00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:39,736
Bob Martin lost
eight to ten pints of blood.

00:09:41,437 --> 00:09:43,573
Where is it?

00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:48,503
So do want to tell me about
the silver flecks I found?

00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,504
Paint chips?

00:09:49,571 --> 00:09:51,273
Aluminum and melamine
in the color coat

00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:53,208
indicate that
it's car paint.

00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,576
Factory job.

00:09:54,643 --> 00:09:58,313
Uh, body shop paint
contains styrene,
not melamine.

00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:01,711
Mm, what type of car?

00:10:01,778 --> 00:10:03,312
Trick question.

00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:04,614
Paint won't tell me that.

00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,882
But I do have an answer.

00:10:05,948 --> 00:10:08,351
It's not technically part
of my job description

00:10:08,418 --> 00:10:10,053
but as you know,
I'm always eager

00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:12,121
to expand my
responsibilities.

00:10:12,188 --> 00:10:14,390
Take a look
down the scope.

00:10:16,392 --> 00:10:18,661
GRISSOM:
Looks like
some sort of insignia.

00:10:18,728 --> 00:10:20,229
Crosshairs.

00:10:20,296 --> 00:10:22,265
That's the plastic
you collected

00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,733
at the accident site.

00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,136
Now that mark is only found
on the S-class Mercedes.

00:10:27,203 --> 00:10:28,671
It's all about
branding.

00:10:28,738 --> 00:10:32,041
Now knowing
that the headlight
came from a Mercedes

00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:34,811
I was able to compare
the infrared spectra

00:10:34,877 --> 00:10:38,314
with the paint spectra
supplied by the manufacturer.

00:10:38,381 --> 00:10:39,782
Check this out.

00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,487
SANDERS:
Your vehicle was painted
Sarasota Silver.

00:10:44,554 --> 00:10:48,591
Also, only available on
the S-series '99 models.

00:10:48,658 --> 00:10:50,660
I checked with
the Mercedes state rep.

00:10:50,727 --> 00:10:52,095
Five were sold in Nevada.

00:10:52,161 --> 00:10:53,863
Sara's tracking down
the owners.

00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:58,034
You've, uh, already shared
this information with Sara?

00:10:58,101 --> 00:10:59,268
Yeah, an hour ago.

00:10:59,335 --> 00:11:02,305
And she was way more
fascinated than you are.

00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,173
Well, I'm somewhat
fascinated by the fact

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,476
that I'm your boss,
but you talked to her first.

00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,411
Well, you were at dinner.

00:11:08,478 --> 00:11:11,214
I've been in the lab
all day, Greg.

00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,152
I've been
looking for you.

00:11:16,219 --> 00:11:17,687
Well, it's hard
to see me

00:11:17,754 --> 00:11:19,922
if you and Greg
are out ahead of me.

00:11:19,989 --> 00:11:21,424
Oh, uh, sorry
about that

00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:23,993
but Brass got me a list
of those Mercedes owners.

00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,295
One moved to Los Angeles,
three are over 50.

00:11:26,362 --> 00:11:28,998
My guess, they would have
stopped and rendered aid.

00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:30,400
Brass is checking them out

00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:33,035
which leaves
a Ben Weston, 25.

00:11:33,102 --> 00:11:35,671
Leased the vehicle
last week.

00:11:37,073 --> 00:11:38,975
You found my car?

00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:40,510
Why? Is your car missing?

00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:43,279
Yeah, isn't that why
you guys are here?

00:11:43,346 --> 00:11:46,315
I filed a police report
a couple days ago.

00:11:46,382 --> 00:11:47,884
God, I love that car.

00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,519
Hocked my future on it.

00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:51,821
Tell me it hasn't been stripped.

00:11:51,888 --> 00:11:53,022
You wouldn't
happen to have

00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:54,857
a copy of that police
report, would you?

00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:57,427
I'm a lawyer.

00:11:57,493 --> 00:11:58,761
Here you go.

00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:02,065
Thanks.

00:12:02,131 --> 00:12:06,102
Sarasota Silver, S-series,
stolen Monday night.

00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:08,137
Yeah, I stopped
for take-out after work.

00:12:08,204 --> 00:12:09,705
When I came out, it was gone.

00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:13,443
Don't most of these luxury
vehicles have security systems?

00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:15,878
What's with all the questions?

00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:18,181
We're investigating
a possible hit-and-run.

00:12:18,247 --> 00:12:20,950
You think the bastard
that stole my car hit someone?

00:12:23,252 --> 00:12:26,122
GRISSOM:
Ignacias High,
Nevada State University...

00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:27,123
Are you a local?

00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,325
Yeah. Great town.

00:12:29,392 --> 00:12:31,094
I studied my ass off
in law school.

00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,462
Passed the bar first time.

00:12:32,528 --> 00:12:33,463
Good for you.

00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:34,464
Let me guess--

00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,765
criminal defense?

00:12:35,832 --> 00:12:37,433
Everyone deserves
representation.

00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,434
Yes, they do.

00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:39,669
Would you happen
to remember

00:12:39,736 --> 00:12:41,204
what clothes you were
wearing yesterday?

00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,439
A blue pinstripe,
a light blue oxford

00:12:43,506 --> 00:12:45,375
gray tie--
a gift from my girlfriend.

00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,375
First week as
an associate--

00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,310
firm like this

00:12:47,376 --> 00:12:50,083
you tend to pay attention
to wardrobe.

00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,084
SIDLE:
Mr. Weston,
we'd like

00:12:51,151 --> 00:12:53,019
to take a look
at those clothes.

00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:54,988
Really?

00:12:55,055 --> 00:12:57,157
Well, you need a warrant.

00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,710
But I'm a nice guy.

00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:02,879
I picked them up
at lunch.

00:13:02,946 --> 00:13:05,215
Downstairs--
one-hour dry cleaning.

00:13:05,282 --> 00:13:07,284
Nice suit.

00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:08,518
Thank you.

00:13:08,585 --> 00:13:10,020
I just bought it.

00:13:11,855 --> 00:13:14,658
I hope you didn't
just buy the shirt.

00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:16,426
Oh, come on.

00:13:17,527 --> 00:13:19,896
I've been meaning
to change dry cleaners.

00:13:19,963 --> 00:13:21,965
Well, maybe you shouldn't
have gotten lye on it.

00:13:22,032 --> 00:13:23,300
Lye is an alkali

00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:25,802
and when it's mixed with water,
it eats right through fabric.

00:13:25,869 --> 00:13:28,038
Mr. Weston...

00:13:28,105 --> 00:13:29,573
you mind taking off your shirt?

00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,141
Excuse me?

00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,576
Lye can burn through fabric.

00:13:32,643 --> 00:13:34,144
It can also burn through skin.

00:13:34,211 --> 00:13:35,445
I have my limits.

00:13:35,512 --> 00:13:38,148
You want me to strip,
you're going to need a warrant.

00:13:38,215 --> 00:13:40,350
But since there's no basis
for your request

00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:41,685
you can forget about it.

00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,101
MAN:
She drowned.

00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:51,136
This is the girl I found
in the desert.

00:13:51,203 --> 00:13:52,137
I am aware
of that.

00:13:52,204 --> 00:13:53,305
She drowned.

00:13:53,372 --> 00:13:54,640
It's not possible, Dave-o.

00:13:54,707 --> 00:13:56,242
She was found
in Diablo Canyon--

00:13:56,308 --> 00:13:58,077
miles from the nearest
water source.

00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,945
Lake Mead's got to be
20 miles away.

00:14:00,012 --> 00:14:01,680
Desert, no desert--
I don't care.

00:14:01,747 --> 00:14:02,748
She drowned.

00:14:02,815 --> 00:14:04,617
Look, if it's
any consolation

00:14:04,683 --> 00:14:05,718
she dry-drowned.

00:14:05,784 --> 00:14:06,819
Dry-drowned?

00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:09,655
Happens in about
ten percent of all cases.

00:14:09,722 --> 00:14:11,757
When dry-drowning occurs
the larynx closes

00:14:11,824 --> 00:14:14,360
involuntarily

00:14:14,426 --> 00:14:17,229
<i>preventing air and water</i>
<i>from entering the lungs</i>

00:14:17,296 --> 00:14:18,597
<i>resulting in hypoxia--</i>

00:14:18,664 --> 00:14:21,133
a reduced concentration
of oxygen in the blood.

00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,602
Thus, water's
kept out of the lungs--

00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:24,603
dry-drowning.

00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,306
In wet drowning,
hypoxia also occurs

00:14:27,373 --> 00:14:30,342
<i>but the larynx relaxes</i>
<i>and water floods the lungs.</i>

00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:33,445
Still, the question remains,
how does a girl drown

00:14:33,512 --> 00:14:35,614
in the middle
of the desert?

00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:36,949
She doesn't.

00:14:37,016 --> 00:14:38,450
She was engaged.

00:14:38,517 --> 00:14:42,655
The guy never filed
a missing persons on her.

00:14:42,721 --> 00:14:45,925
I didn't file a missing persons
report on Stacy

00:14:45,991 --> 00:14:47,826
because she wasn't missing.

00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:49,795
As far as I knew,
she was on a solo trek

00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:51,730
up in Diablo working
toward her NESTFs.

00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:53,732
NESTFs?

00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,900
Sorry.

00:14:54,967 --> 00:14:57,102
National
Extreme Sports Trainer Finals.

00:14:57,169 --> 00:14:58,370
I took mine last week.

00:14:58,437 --> 00:14:59,939
Did it in three days total.

00:15:00,005 --> 00:15:03,142
So, I didn't expect her back
for at least two more days.

00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:04,743
Okay.

00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,879
You mind if I have
a look around?

00:15:06,946 --> 00:15:09,081
No, go ahead.

00:15:09,148 --> 00:15:10,516
Thanks.

00:15:57,329 --> 00:15:59,899
Detective.

00:16:10,976 --> 00:16:12,745
You see that?

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,848
Mr. Hudson...

00:16:15,915 --> 00:16:19,051
you own this house with
Stacy Warner, is that right?

00:16:19,118 --> 00:16:20,586
That's right.

00:16:20,653 --> 00:16:22,855
Any idea
how this blood got there?

00:16:25,824 --> 00:16:26,792
No.

00:16:26,859 --> 00:16:28,194
Stacy had a head trauma wound.

00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,796
You wouldn't know anything
about that either, would you?

00:16:30,863 --> 00:16:32,831
I'd never hurt Stacy.

00:16:32,898 --> 00:16:34,033
No?

00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:36,835
How do you explain
the domestic disturbance call

00:16:36,902 --> 00:16:38,637
to this address two weeks ago?

00:16:38,704 --> 00:16:40,973
We told the officers then
it was nothing.

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,608
I don't know...

00:16:42,675 --> 00:16:44,643
the neighbor who
filed the complaint

00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,812
said you were really yelling
at Stacy.

00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:48,214
Said it sounded abusive.

00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,949
HUDSON:
We're sports trainers.

00:16:50,015 --> 00:16:52,585
We say some crazy things
to get each other

00:16:52,651 --> 00:16:55,654
to do one more lap in the pool,
one more crunch.

00:16:55,721 --> 00:16:56,989
Are you a liar?!

00:16:57,056 --> 00:16:59,792
Or are you going
to give me more?!

00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:02,528
Are you weak?
Are you worthless?!

00:17:02,595 --> 00:17:04,897
Can you account for your
whereabouts this week?

00:17:04,964 --> 00:17:06,899
Big Sky Triathlon
in Montana.

00:17:06,966 --> 00:17:10,636
You want to see a picture
of me crossing the finish line?

00:17:10,703 --> 00:17:12,905
No. No.

00:17:12,972 --> 00:17:15,508
We got what we need.

00:17:17,977 --> 00:17:18,708
BRASS:
So I sent out
some bulletins.

00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,877
Got a hit on Weston's
missing Mercedes.

00:17:20,944 --> 00:17:22,178
Sullivan called it in.

00:17:22,245 --> 00:17:23,546
He's a typical tow guy.

00:17:23,613 --> 00:17:24,781
I'll run him.

00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,593
MAN:
Yeah, I got a call.

00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,596
"You want a wrecked
S-class?"

00:17:32,663 --> 00:17:33,631
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:17:33,697 --> 00:17:34,965
You betcha.

00:17:35,032 --> 00:17:37,568
The parts alone are worth
four or five times

00:17:37,635 --> 00:17:39,403
the Blue Book value
of the car.

00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,871
I asked where do
I pick it up.

00:17:40,938 --> 00:17:41,872
That's all I asked.

00:17:41,939 --> 00:17:43,441
You didn't ask his name?

00:17:43,507 --> 00:17:45,743
Someone throws you
300 thou in used parts

00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,212
the only response
is "thank you very much."

00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:50,114
So where is the vehicle now?

00:17:50,181 --> 00:17:51,916
Look around.

00:17:51,982 --> 00:17:54,085
You work fast.

00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:55,086
Hey, I called it in.

00:17:55,152 --> 00:17:56,287
What more
do you want?

00:17:56,353 --> 00:17:57,655
Aristotle said something

00:17:57,721 --> 00:18:00,691
about the whole being more
than the sum of its parts.

00:18:00,758 --> 00:18:03,227
Of course, he never
worked in a chop shop.

00:18:03,294 --> 00:18:05,663
We want all of the parts.

00:18:20,945 --> 00:18:23,514
Affirmative for blood--
passenger side.

00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,685
Well, that's just
a trace amount.

00:18:27,752 --> 00:18:28,986
Where's the rest
of it?

00:18:29,053 --> 00:18:31,655
Want to pass me the luminol?

00:18:53,043 --> 00:18:56,313
Well, you do know
how to light up a room.

00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,549
Location of the blood
on the seats and the dash

00:18:58,616 --> 00:19:00,718
indicates that
the victim

00:19:00,785 --> 00:19:02,052
was inside the vehicle.

00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:04,288
Maybe the driver hit Bob Martin

00:19:04,355 --> 00:19:07,024
stopped
and put him in the front seat.

00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:08,259
Okay.

00:19:08,325 --> 00:19:10,461
Where'd they go?

00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:12,897
Well, not to the emergency room.

00:19:12,963 --> 00:19:14,832
Not to Sunset Park
for 48 hours.

00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:16,200
I'll swab
the rest
of the car--

00:19:16,267 --> 00:19:17,368
bring the samples
to Greg

00:19:17,435 --> 00:19:20,171
and have him run it
against Bob Martin's DNA.

00:19:20,237 --> 00:19:23,841
If you find any blood
that isn't his then...

00:19:23,908 --> 00:19:27,178
Maybe it belongs
to an injured joyrider

00:19:27,244 --> 00:19:29,647
and we have a new suspect.

00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,084
The one day
I'm due in court

00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:47,354
and you pull a drowning
in the desert.

00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:48,355
How'd it go?

00:19:48,422 --> 00:19:49,723
Oh, it went great.

00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:53,060
The judge recessed
right before my testimony.

00:19:53,127 --> 00:19:57,665
I'm on call.
Catherine's on call.

00:19:57,731 --> 00:19:59,458
You're making progress.

00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,194
The blood from the poolside
matches the female victim.

00:20:02,261 --> 00:20:04,597
Yeah, the problem is
the small amount of blood

00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:05,731
found in her own home

00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:07,866
isn't enough to prove anything,
you know?

00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:09,101
People bump their heads

00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:10,417
and scrape their knees
all the time.

00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,385
Yeah.

00:20:11,451 --> 00:20:13,787
That musclehead
boyfriend--

00:20:13,854 --> 00:20:15,122
he's a little shady.

00:20:15,188 --> 00:20:17,324
He's hiding something.
I can feel it.

00:20:17,391 --> 00:20:18,525
Are you able to prove

00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,827
that he drowned her
in their swimming pool?

00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:23,263
Four samples:
one from their swimming pool

00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,799
one from their bathroom,
one from Lake Mead

00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:27,267
and one from Clark County
Reservoir

00:20:27,334 --> 00:20:28,902
but none are consistent
with the water

00:20:28,969 --> 00:20:30,137
I recovered from her stomach.

00:20:30,203 --> 00:20:31,505
What else did you collect
from the scene?

00:20:31,571 --> 00:20:34,141
Some rocks from under her body

00:20:34,207 --> 00:20:36,143
and a goose feather.

00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:37,711
Goose feather?

00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,480
This looks like basalt rock.

00:20:40,547 --> 00:20:42,849
Didn't it say somewhere in here

00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,318
that she found her
at 1,500 feet?

00:20:45,385 --> 00:20:47,020
The desert, yeah.

00:20:47,087 --> 00:20:48,922
Well, you can only find
this rock

00:20:48,989 --> 00:20:50,857
at high altitudes
like 4,000 feet.

00:20:50,924 --> 00:20:52,125
Really?

00:20:52,192 --> 00:20:53,393
Mm-hmm.

00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,528
You sure?

00:20:54,594 --> 00:20:58,098
Yeah. I went on this field trip
up at Table Mountain

00:20:58,165 --> 00:21:00,734
in my senior year--
"Rocks for Jocks."

00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,936
Don't ask me why
I remember any of this.

00:21:03,003 --> 00:21:03,937
Hey, that helps.

00:21:04,004 --> 00:21:05,972
I think I'm going
to head out there.

00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:06,973
You want to roll?

00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,276
You're on call at court,
right.

00:21:09,343 --> 00:21:11,912
All that blood belonged
to the victim.

00:21:11,978 --> 00:21:13,013
Look at this.

00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,982
Visible blood drops
under the passenger seat.

00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:18,685
That's a strange place
for blood.

00:21:18,752 --> 00:21:21,154
Radiated spatter.

00:21:21,221 --> 00:21:22,422
What do you think?

00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,424
<i>Blood pooled</i>
<i>onto the floormat.</i>

00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,226
<i>As more drops splashed down</i>

00:21:26,293 --> 00:21:28,395
<i>the impact projected</i>
<i>the blood drops upward.</i>

00:21:28,462 --> 00:21:29,396
Okay.

00:21:29,463 --> 00:21:32,099
But where
did it fall from?

00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,000
Greg said you guys
are processing an S-class.

00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:35,736
Yeah, what's left of it.

00:21:35,802 --> 00:21:37,204
Now, that's a crime.

00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,440
Oh, this would have broken
my ex's heart.

00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:44,378
Every weekend the guy'd be
test-driving another Mercedes.

00:21:44,444 --> 00:21:46,313
I'd get myself all dressed up

00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,716
make the dealer believe
we could actually afford it.

00:21:49,783 --> 00:21:52,386
Damn.

00:21:52,452 --> 00:21:54,287
Except if this car was stolen

00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:55,789
the ignition lock would be
punched, right?

00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,724
Huh?

00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:00,293
Anyway, I got to go.
Warrick and I are due in court.

00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,395
Later.

00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,033
We... we would
have caught that.

00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:09,936
We were distracted
by what we were
looking for.

00:22:10,003 --> 00:22:12,572
Yeah.

00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:15,642
So how did the thief
turn the engine over

00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,744
without breaking that lock?

00:22:17,811 --> 00:22:21,148
Maybe there is no thief.

00:22:22,783 --> 00:22:24,618
WESTON:
<i>All right, you got me.</i>

00:22:24,685 --> 00:22:26,486
I ran
into the Chinese restaurant.

00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:29,456
I wasn't in there
more than two minutes

00:22:29,523 --> 00:22:32,426
but I left my keys
in the car.

00:22:32,492 --> 00:22:35,395
You left
an $80,000 Mercedes idling.

00:22:35,462 --> 00:22:36,997
Yeah.

00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:37,998
Stupid, right?

00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,167
That's why I didn't
say anything.

00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,335
Besides,
if my insurance finds out

00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,237
it's contributory negligence.

00:22:44,304 --> 00:22:45,839
Let's just
cut to the chase.

00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,074
I told you everything.

00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,909
Chinese restaurant
near my house.

00:22:48,975 --> 00:22:50,143
I couldn't find a parking spot.

00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,145
Parked in the handicapped zone,
left the motor running.

00:22:52,212 --> 00:22:54,014
I wasn't in there
more than a minute.

00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,283
Take off your shirt, please.

00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,119
You're going to need a warrant,
like I said.

00:22:59,186 --> 00:23:00,754
But you don't
have basis.

00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:02,789
Actually, the issuing judge
disagrees.

00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:10,030
I can call Judge Scott,
contest your grounds.

00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,064
But you won't.

00:23:11,131 --> 00:23:12,099
You want to refuse?

00:23:12,165 --> 00:23:14,368
One of us will remove it
for you.

00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,604
Yeah, all right.

00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:23,310
Here you go.

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,848
Look, no chemical burns.

00:23:27,914 --> 00:23:29,216
You satisfied?

00:23:33,253 --> 00:23:36,323
The warrant
is for the whole shirt.

00:23:37,324 --> 00:23:38,992
Yeah.

00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,103
You don't have to be
a scientist

00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,872
to know where that came from.

00:23:51,938 --> 00:23:52,973
( <i>tires screeching</i> )

00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,708
We got enough
for a hit-and-run.

00:23:54,775 --> 00:23:56,610
All right, hold on.

00:23:56,677 --> 00:23:58,078
It's not what you think.

00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,746
<i>I called in my order.</i>

00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,549
<i>I looked down to put away</i>
<i>my phone.</i>

00:24:02,616 --> 00:24:04,017
( <i>bang</i> )

00:24:04,084 --> 00:24:06,319
<i>I hit something.</i>

00:24:06,386 --> 00:24:08,622
<i>I stopped. I looked around.</i>

00:24:08,689 --> 00:24:10,691
<i>I couldn't see anything.</i>

00:24:10,757 --> 00:24:15,529
I figured it must have been
a dog and it ran off.

00:24:15,595 --> 00:24:17,431
So I drove
to the restaurant

00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,700
and that's when
my car was stolen.

00:24:19,766 --> 00:24:22,936
It was a rough night.

00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,838
Look, my car was stolen.

00:24:24,905 --> 00:24:27,407
What happened next,
I don't know.

00:24:27,474 --> 00:24:30,043
Save it.

00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,411
You're under arrest.

00:24:31,478 --> 00:24:33,513
All right.

00:24:42,255 --> 00:24:44,224
I hate lawyers.

00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:47,461
We need a warrant for his house.

00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,062
We need to find something
we can use

00:24:49,129 --> 00:24:50,664
to keep that creep
off the street.

00:24:58,305 --> 00:25:00,273
( <i>panting</i> )

00:25:01,975 --> 00:25:04,044
I'm all for retracing
the girl's steps

00:25:04,111 --> 00:25:06,613
but it wouldn't hurt
to bring in some cadets.

00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,816
If it was a little kid
or a mass casualty

00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,619
maybe we'd get
that kind of manpower

00:25:12,686 --> 00:25:15,956
but hey, exercise is good
for us, right?

00:25:16,023 --> 00:25:19,226
Air feels thin to me.

00:25:19,292 --> 00:25:20,994
( <i>grunting</i> )

00:25:34,508 --> 00:25:36,176
Check it out.

00:25:38,445 --> 00:25:40,080
Let's go.

00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,398
You said the vic
was wearing

00:25:58,465 --> 00:26:00,267
light layers of
clothing, right?

00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,536
Yeah, several layers,
tempered cotton.

00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:06,073
This is a men's extra large.

00:26:06,139 --> 00:26:07,441
This is too big for her.

00:26:07,507 --> 00:26:13,046
Goose down like
I found on her body.

00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,581
What's this?

00:26:21,054 --> 00:26:26,293
Ah. Property of Mr. Muscles.

00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,694
You want to run it?

00:26:27,761 --> 00:26:31,598
Well, maybe he left
a day later than he said

00:26:31,665 --> 00:26:34,634
for his little marathon,
you know?

00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:37,337
Followed her out here,
started arguing with her

00:26:37,404 --> 00:26:41,708
<i>no neighbors around</i>
<i>to call the cops.</i>

00:26:41,775 --> 00:26:43,110
( <i>shrieks</i> )

00:26:43,176 --> 00:26:44,878
<i>She manages</i>
<i>to fight her way free</i>

00:26:44,945 --> 00:26:49,049
<i>finds higher ground,</i>
<i>he follows her, takes her</i>
<i>down.</i>

00:26:49,116 --> 00:26:50,050
So then what?

00:26:50,117 --> 00:26:52,386
He drowns her
with canteen water?

00:26:53,954 --> 00:26:56,523
I'm going to let you
run that by the DA.

00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,359
You should try describing
a scuba diver

00:26:59,426 --> 00:27:00,494
up in a tree, man.

00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,596
This is nothing.

00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:05,899
No, the evidence tells a story.

00:27:05,966 --> 00:27:08,035
So why'd a cagey guy
like our suspect

00:27:08,101 --> 00:27:09,503
leave his jacket up here?

00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:12,139
Everybody thinks
they have a plan

00:27:12,205 --> 00:27:14,641
till things start
to go wrong.

00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:19,946
I gave Stacy my jacket
the morning she left for Diablo

00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,281
for night layering.

00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,750
Extreme hikers can't carry
bedrolls.

00:27:23,817 --> 00:27:25,719
That's what makes it extreme.

00:27:25,786 --> 00:27:29,322
And she just left
your jacket wedged
under some rocks.

00:27:29,389 --> 00:27:32,459
Maybe.
I don't know.

00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:36,063
Look, I gave it to her
to take care of her.

00:27:36,129 --> 00:27:38,665
I loved Stacy.

00:27:38,732 --> 00:27:41,368
Then help us out here, man.

00:27:41,435 --> 00:27:43,537
I've got
prior disturbance calls

00:27:43,603 --> 00:27:45,005
her blood in the pool

00:27:45,072 --> 00:27:46,306
her body drowned

00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:50,377
in the middle of the desert
with your jacket nearby

00:27:50,444 --> 00:27:51,511
your map.

00:27:51,578 --> 00:27:54,181
That's my trail map.
I'd like it back.

00:27:54,247 --> 00:27:57,751
No. No, it's evidence now.

00:27:57,818 --> 00:27:59,553
You can put
a request in for it

00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:01,621
when we complete
our investigation, okay?

00:28:01,688 --> 00:28:03,457
Am I free to go?

00:28:03,523 --> 00:28:05,292
You're not under arrest.

00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,334
I'm getting this to QD.

00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,769
He doesn't want me
to have this map

00:28:15,836 --> 00:28:18,505
and I want to know why.

00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,514
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:28,749
He made bail.

00:28:28,815 --> 00:28:30,617
Yeah, that figures.

00:28:30,684 --> 00:28:31,985
Oh, I almost forgot.

00:28:32,052 --> 00:28:34,788
Here's a warrant
to search your premises.

00:28:34,855 --> 00:28:37,090
We'd like to start
in your garage.

00:28:37,157 --> 00:28:40,160
Yeah.

00:28:40,227 --> 00:28:43,363
Look, I'm filing a complaint
with your supervisor.

00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,098
You're harassing me.

00:28:45,165 --> 00:28:47,367
If you're a lawyer
you should know

00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,703
the legal definition
of harassment.

00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:53,306
Investigating a crime
doesn't quite fit the criteria.

00:28:53,373 --> 00:28:55,375
However, a false accusation
of harassment

00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,478
within earshot of my colleagues
could be construed as slander.

00:28:58,545 --> 00:28:59,813
I know the law, too

00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,482
and I've actually been
in a courtroom.

00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:27,260
This was parked in
the driveway, wasn't it?

00:29:27,327 --> 00:29:29,529
Now that's a crime?

00:29:29,596 --> 00:29:32,699
Jim, could you get
this car moved for us?

00:29:32,766 --> 00:29:35,035
Unless the keys
are in the ignition

00:29:35,102 --> 00:29:36,069
hand them over.

00:29:36,136 --> 00:29:37,337
It's a rental.

00:29:37,404 --> 00:29:39,473
You're not
on my policy.

00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:41,241
I'm a safe driver.

00:30:01,695 --> 00:30:03,864
It smells like bleach to me.

00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,066
I'll check for blood.

00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:08,301
Why would he leave
his car outside

00:30:08,368 --> 00:30:11,872
with the sprinklers on
instead of putting it in here?

00:30:11,938 --> 00:30:14,241
Maybe the garage was full.

00:30:28,021 --> 00:30:29,956
MAN:
What exactly do you
want me to look for?

00:30:30,023 --> 00:30:32,025
STOKES:
Alterations, erasures,
paper content.

00:30:32,092 --> 00:30:34,561
The guy was really
nervous about me
having these maps.

00:30:34,628 --> 00:30:36,563
Okay, I'll test
the components in the inks

00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,798
and then bombard the paper

00:30:37,864 --> 00:30:39,499
with different wavelengths
of light.

00:30:39,566 --> 00:30:40,500
We'll see what's up.

00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:41,635
Sounds good, man.

00:30:41,702 --> 00:30:42,333
Thanks, man.

00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:42,917
You bet.

00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:44,536
Hey, Grissom...

00:30:44,602 --> 00:30:46,438
Keep me posted.
I will.

00:30:46,504 --> 00:30:48,873
Did you take a look
at that maggot from
the desert yet?

00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,874
Yes.

00:30:49,941 --> 00:30:50,909
And?

00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:53,044
Well, it belongs
to the family
of sarcophagids.

00:30:53,111 --> 00:30:54,112
That's as far
as I got.

00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:55,780
You mind taking
another look for me?

00:30:55,847 --> 00:30:58,049
Your maggot never
developed, Nick.

00:30:58,116 --> 00:30:59,084
It never will.

00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,118
Why?

00:31:00,185 --> 00:31:01,286
It happens to
Sarcophagids

00:31:01,353 --> 00:31:03,355
when they're exposed
to freezing temperatures

00:31:03,421 --> 00:31:04,856
before they're
allowed to pupate.

00:31:04,923 --> 00:31:06,624
So, my maggot
was stunted?

00:31:06,691 --> 00:31:08,193
Probably by
frozen air.

00:31:08,259 --> 00:31:11,062
Yeah, but we found
the vic in the desert.

00:31:11,129 --> 00:31:13,665
Well, maybe it was
a very cold night.

00:31:13,732 --> 00:31:15,667
<i>Mucho frio.</i>

00:31:17,168 --> 00:31:20,138
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

00:31:30,115 --> 00:31:32,150
Come on in, Greg.

00:31:36,855 --> 00:31:37,822
Hey.

00:31:37,889 --> 00:31:38,923
Hey.

00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,659
So I heard about
your cold maggot.

00:31:41,726 --> 00:31:43,194
News travels fast.

00:31:43,261 --> 00:31:45,263
I was thinking--

00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:48,666
most people figure Las Vegas
means The Strip.

00:31:48,733 --> 00:31:51,169
But it really means
"the meadows."

00:31:51,236 --> 00:31:54,239
I'm trying to calculate
barometric pressures here, G.

00:31:54,305 --> 00:31:55,473
Well, my point is

00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,043
Nevada is a
basin-and-range state.

00:31:58,109 --> 00:32:01,179
Down in the desert basin,
hardly any rain.

00:32:01,246 --> 00:32:03,381
But up in the
mountain ranges

00:32:03,448 --> 00:32:05,450
it's 40 inches a year.

00:32:05,517 --> 00:32:06,518
That's more

00:32:06,584 --> 00:32:07,519
than Seattle

00:32:07,585 --> 00:32:09,521
more than San Francisco.
more than...

00:32:09,587 --> 00:32:11,556
Yeah, yeah, I see
where you're going.

00:32:11,623 --> 00:32:13,625
Last week in Vegas--
perfect weather.

00:32:13,692 --> 00:32:16,561
Warm, steady barometric
pressure, but...

00:32:16,628 --> 00:32:21,166
out in Diablo, two days before
I found Stacy Warner's body...

00:32:21,232 --> 00:32:23,234
The mountain
shadow effect.

00:32:31,109 --> 00:32:33,578
That's what
meteorologists call it.

00:32:33,645 --> 00:32:35,613
Right.

00:32:39,451 --> 00:32:40,952
This is Ecklie's
Mercedes?

00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:44,656
Well, actually,
I sold it to him--
five years ago.

00:32:44,723 --> 00:32:47,492
It was in much better
condition back then.

00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:49,594
Hey.

00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:52,702
So I checked
with Auto Detail.

00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:55,605
Uh, obviously, if you fill
a car up with enough water

00:32:55,671 --> 00:32:56,906
or, in our case, blood

00:32:56,973 --> 00:32:59,042
it's going to leak
through the bottom.

00:32:59,108 --> 00:33:02,145
Dicing wounds with
glass were limited

00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:04,414
to the upper torso, right?

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,449
Top of the head, face,
top of shoulders

00:33:06,516 --> 00:33:07,784
and forearms.

00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,219
Which would be consistent
with a head-on crash.

00:33:10,286 --> 00:33:14,457
The head of the victim
crashed into the passenger side

00:33:14,524 --> 00:33:15,758
of the windshield.

00:33:15,825 --> 00:33:17,694
Well, this isn't
the same model or year

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,795
but it's
close enough.

00:33:18,861 --> 00:33:21,998
Okay, I'm thinking
that the car

00:33:22,065 --> 00:33:24,067
clipped the victim here

00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:25,868
and he was catapulted...

00:33:27,737 --> 00:33:31,340
and he was positioned
something like this.

00:33:33,976 --> 00:33:37,280
( <i>glass shattering</i> )

00:33:37,346 --> 00:33:38,414
So now he's bleeding

00:33:38,481 --> 00:33:40,683
and his blood is dripping
onto the mat.

00:33:45,655 --> 00:33:47,990
The victim bled out
for two days.

00:33:48,057 --> 00:33:50,860
Yeah, but he could
have been conscious, right?

00:33:50,927 --> 00:33:53,129
Until he lost
a third of his

00:33:53,196 --> 00:33:54,430
circulating blood volume?

00:33:54,497 --> 00:33:57,700
Then the hypovolemic shock
would have set in

00:33:57,767 --> 00:33:59,936
after approximately 12 hours.

00:34:00,002 --> 00:34:02,238
So it's possible
that he was wedged

00:34:02,305 --> 00:34:05,141
into the windshield
of Ben Weston's Mercedes

00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:07,810
which was parked
in Ben Weston's garage.

00:34:07,877 --> 00:34:10,613
We know where Bob Martin was.

00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,648
Where was Ben Weston?

00:34:12,715 --> 00:34:14,884
My guess...

00:34:14,951 --> 00:34:18,287
At work,
making a good impression.

00:34:22,258 --> 00:34:26,396
Sometimes I'm glad
I only deal with dead people.

00:34:28,898 --> 00:34:30,867
You know...

00:34:30,933 --> 00:34:36,839
the tow truck driver said
Weston's Mercedes was totaled.

00:34:36,906 --> 00:34:38,374
But the only damage
would have been

00:34:38,441 --> 00:34:39,876
to the bumper
and the windshield.

00:34:39,942 --> 00:34:42,178
He's lying.

00:34:42,245 --> 00:34:43,713
Maybe it
wasn't totaled.

00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,847
I don't remember.

00:34:44,914 --> 00:34:47,150
I was only interested
in the parts.

00:34:47,216 --> 00:34:49,152
You don't know
who phoned it in?

00:34:49,218 --> 00:34:50,219
It was a guy.

00:34:50,286 --> 00:34:53,222
What else
can I tell you?

00:34:53,289 --> 00:34:55,391
Mr. Sullivan, in '96
you were arrested

00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:56,693
for vandalism, right?

00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:58,428
I was 18.
It was a prank.

00:34:58,494 --> 00:35:01,230
I hoisted the principal's
station wagon

00:35:01,297 --> 00:35:03,066
onto the roof of the gym.

00:35:03,132 --> 00:35:05,068
St. Ignacias High School, right?

00:35:05,134 --> 00:35:06,969
GRISSOM:
It's funny, but
the registered owner

00:35:07,036 --> 00:35:09,472
of the Mercedes
also went to St. Ignacious.

00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:11,541
You were in
the same class.

00:35:11,607 --> 00:35:14,043
Ben Weston.

00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,845
That might ring a bell.

00:35:15,912 --> 00:35:16,913
So what?

00:35:16,979 --> 00:35:18,514
He's been arrested
on a hit-and-run.

00:35:18,581 --> 00:35:20,149
He's also under suspicion
for murder.

00:35:20,216 --> 00:35:22,151
That makes you an accomplice
after the fact.

00:35:22,218 --> 00:35:23,219
Twenty to life.

00:35:23,286 --> 00:35:25,321
Okay, look, all I did

00:35:25,388 --> 00:35:27,156
was take his call,
take his car.

00:35:27,223 --> 00:35:29,158
I don't even like the guy.

00:35:29,225 --> 00:35:31,694
In high school,
he's the one
who turned me in.

00:35:31,761 --> 00:35:34,831
He said he wanted
to make it up to me.

00:35:40,336 --> 00:35:41,771
Just remind yourself

00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:44,407
that usually I bring
the case home.

00:35:46,142 --> 00:35:49,278
If that garage floor stain
started out as blood

00:35:49,345 --> 00:35:51,180
the bleach
just degraded it.

00:35:51,247 --> 00:35:53,082
There's nothing for me
to work with.

00:35:53,149 --> 00:35:54,584
Sorry.

00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,918
There goes the slam dunk.

00:35:55,985 --> 00:35:56,953
Blood in the garage

00:35:57,019 --> 00:35:59,689
would have conclusively
linked victim to killer.

00:36:01,424 --> 00:36:04,160
So is this his
rental car?

00:36:04,227 --> 00:36:06,496
Sunset Park is two miles
from Ben Weston's house.

00:36:06,562 --> 00:36:08,231
I was thinking maybe
he used this car

00:36:08,297 --> 00:36:10,099
to transport the body
to the dump site.

00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:13,336
So we should be able to find
some of the vic's blood

00:36:13,403 --> 00:36:15,538
or hair or fibers
from his clothes.

00:36:15,605 --> 00:36:17,507
No visible trace
of any kind.

00:36:20,943 --> 00:36:23,279
Except for this.

00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:28,418
So this mountain
shadow effect--

00:36:28,484 --> 00:36:30,386
the barometric
pressure spikes down

00:36:30,453 --> 00:36:32,155
the temperature
strikes down...

00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:33,790
Right. Humidity
spikes up.

00:36:33,856 --> 00:36:35,692
Moisture in the air
condenses.

00:36:35,758 --> 00:36:38,728
( <i>thunder crashing</i> )

00:36:38,795 --> 00:36:40,830
The mountains get
a flash flood.

00:36:40,897 --> 00:36:42,865
I checked with the National
Weather Service.

00:36:42,932 --> 00:36:45,101
This area got three inches
of rain in 20 minutes

00:36:45,168 --> 00:36:46,536
the night Stacy died.

00:36:46,602 --> 00:36:51,774
<i>So, she was up here hiking</i>
<i>when the weather changed.</i>

00:36:54,577 --> 00:36:56,679
( <i>thunder rumbling</i> )

00:36:56,746 --> 00:36:57,747
( <i>wind whistling</i> )

00:36:57,814 --> 00:36:59,148
<i>Takes one to the head...</i>

00:36:59,215 --> 00:37:00,450
<i>on to the basalt rock.</i>

00:37:00,516 --> 00:37:03,453
<i>She's trying to clear</i>
<i>the cobwebs when the rain hit.</i>

00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:05,688
( <i>thunder rumbling</i> )

00:37:17,734 --> 00:37:20,370
<i>But it was too late.</i>

00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,976
<i>She drowns in the floodwater.</i>

00:37:27,043 --> 00:37:31,180
<i>Body gets carried</i>
<i>to the base of the canyon.</i>

00:37:31,247 --> 00:37:33,516
A couple hours
worth of sun

00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:34,884
water dries up.

00:37:34,951 --> 00:37:37,754
No evidence
of the storm anywhere

00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,322
except on the vic

00:37:39,389 --> 00:37:41,924
who carried traced amounts
of basalt rock with her

00:37:41,991 --> 00:37:45,128
and rainwater
in her throat.

00:37:45,194 --> 00:37:48,998
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:37:49,065 --> 00:37:50,250
Stokes.

00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,552
The map has definitely
been tampered with.

00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:53,754
You sure about that?

00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,821
Positive.

00:37:54,888 --> 00:37:56,790
Chemical tag in the ink
tells the tale.

00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:59,726
Then I shot the maps with
300 nanometers just to be sure.

00:37:59,793 --> 00:38:01,695
I need you to get
those results to me.

00:38:01,762 --> 00:38:03,063
Thought you would.

00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:05,132
I have a messenger on call.

00:38:05,198 --> 00:38:10,137
Are you telling me Stacy's death
was an accident?

00:38:10,203 --> 00:38:12,973
An accident
of nature, yeah.

00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,208
But you still had
a hand in her death

00:38:15,275 --> 00:38:17,511
just the same,
didn't you, Mr. Hudson?

00:38:17,577 --> 00:38:19,646
What are you
talking about?

00:38:19,713 --> 00:38:21,715
Why don't you
take a break.

00:38:21,782 --> 00:38:24,318
Come on over here
for a sec.

00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,254
You altered the map.

00:38:27,321 --> 00:38:29,289
You used the same
color ink as the printer

00:38:29,356 --> 00:38:32,292
but the chemical tags
in the ink are different.

00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:34,261
This is magic marker.

00:38:36,596 --> 00:38:39,366
And when you shine
ultraviolet light on it

00:38:39,433 --> 00:38:40,634
like this...

00:38:40,701 --> 00:38:43,036
you can see exactly
what you did.

00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:45,572
You made this look like
an impenetrable ridge--

00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:47,774
no way out,
when it's actually a meadow.

00:38:47,841 --> 00:38:48,775
If she had a good map

00:38:48,842 --> 00:38:50,677
she might have been able
to find her way

00:38:50,744 --> 00:38:52,279
out of the highlands
by nightfall.

00:38:52,346 --> 00:38:55,015
I didn't want her to die.

00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,751
I didn't.

00:38:57,818 --> 00:38:59,619
Then why did you alter the map?

00:38:59,686 --> 00:39:01,488
We competed.

00:39:01,555 --> 00:39:03,423
I'd just run the trail
in three days.

00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,325
I didn't want her
to beat my time.

00:39:07,327 --> 00:39:09,296
Am I being charged with murder?

00:39:10,897 --> 00:39:12,699
No.

00:39:12,766 --> 00:39:13,834
You altered the map

00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,569
but you didn't make it rain.

00:39:15,635 --> 00:39:17,938
What you did isn't a crime...

00:39:18,005 --> 00:39:21,274
but it is criminal, isn't it?

00:39:25,979 --> 00:39:27,180
Oh, come on.

00:39:27,247 --> 00:39:30,817
Your entire case
is circumstantial.

00:39:30,884 --> 00:39:33,153
Your physical evidence
is pathetic.

00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,355
You've got, what,
a wrecked car--

00:39:35,422 --> 00:39:38,525
a white powder
in a rental--

00:39:38,592 --> 00:39:40,661
and a bleached-out
stain in my garage.

00:39:40,727 --> 00:39:42,029
If that's
all you've got

00:39:42,095 --> 00:39:44,364
you won't even get
a filing.

00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:51,304
My cell phone.

00:39:51,371 --> 00:39:52,339
Yeah.

00:39:52,406 --> 00:39:54,808
Mitchell Sullivan
found it in your car

00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:55,942
at his chop shop.

00:39:56,009 --> 00:39:58,278
I hope he didn't make
any long-distance calls.

00:39:58,345 --> 00:39:59,513
Thanks.

00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,716
It's evidence.

00:40:02,783 --> 00:40:05,218
Yeah.

00:40:05,285 --> 00:40:06,953
Hey, now it's a party.

00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,156
And I brought the music.

00:40:09,222 --> 00:40:11,224
You'll be happy
to know

00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:13,860
that there were no
long-distanced calls
made on your cell phone.

00:40:13,927 --> 00:40:16,363
But there was one call made--

00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:19,800
to 911 at 2:30 a.m.
on Tuesday morning

00:40:19,866 --> 00:40:23,403
while your car was
still in your possession.

00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,072
( <i>tape recorder clicking</i> )

00:40:25,138 --> 00:40:27,074
MAN:
911. What's your emergency?

00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,076
( <i>man gasping</i> ):
Please help me.

00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:30,793
I can't hear you.

00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,328
You'll have to speak up.

00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:38,069
Help...

00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:40,205
Sir, our system is
not compatible

00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,906
with your cellular phone.

00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:43,741
Where are you calling from?

00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:47,078
I'm in a garage.

00:40:47,145 --> 00:40:50,281
Sir, can you see a street sign?

00:40:50,348 --> 00:40:52,483
It's dark...

00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:57,610
Explain it to me, Ben.

00:40:57,677 --> 00:41:01,714
How does a lawyer rationalize
something like this?

00:41:01,781 --> 00:41:04,584
SIDLE:
You know the law.

00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:06,219
You hit a guy.

00:41:06,285 --> 00:41:07,000
It was an accident.

00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,302
Nothing criminal.

00:41:08,368 --> 00:41:12,039
But you let it escalate
to first-degree murder.

00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:15,736
I spoke with your
senior partner.

00:41:15,802 --> 00:41:17,792
It was your first day
on the job.

00:41:17,792 --> 00:41:18,750
Big firm.

00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,452
Big welcome.

00:41:21,417 --> 00:41:24,119
How many drinks
did you have that night?

00:41:24,186 --> 00:41:26,789
GRISSOM:
Let me guess.

00:41:26,855 --> 00:41:28,757
You wanted the alcohol
to wear off

00:41:28,824 --> 00:41:30,626
before you called it in, right?

00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:32,875
So you decided
to wait it out.

00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:34,610
Have a cup of coffee,
sober up

00:41:34,677 --> 00:41:36,078
and then call the cops.

00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:40,483
But unfortunately,
Bob Martin woke up.

00:41:42,718 --> 00:41:44,153
Help me.

00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,223
Please, help...
help me...

00:41:56,265 --> 00:41:57,666
So what do you do now, hmm?

00:41:57,733 --> 00:41:59,702
Can't walk into
the emergency room

00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:01,704
and say, "Hey, this guy
was bleeding to death

00:42:01,771 --> 00:42:03,806
in my garage while I was eating
mu shu pork."

00:42:03,873 --> 00:42:04,974
( <i>door opening</i> )

00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,209
Sara, there's someone
here to see you.

00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:08,978
Not right now.

00:42:09,045 --> 00:42:11,380
You'll want to talk to him.
It's relevant.

00:42:23,759 --> 00:42:27,163
I sacrificed to get where I am.

00:42:27,229 --> 00:42:30,599
My whole life
was leading up
to last Monday.

00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:33,702
Yeah. It's tough, huh?

00:42:33,769 --> 00:42:36,906
Fifteen years
to build your dream

00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:39,775
and a 15-second phone call
destroys it.

00:42:39,842 --> 00:42:41,811
Where did
you find this?

00:42:41,877 --> 00:42:44,213
Packing up
Bob's stuff.

00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,781
Found it
on his dresser.

00:42:45,848 --> 00:42:47,208
Thought you'd
want to see it.

00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:49,010
Thanks.

00:43:11,399 --> 00:43:13,434
When a driver hits a pedestrian

00:43:13,501 --> 00:43:16,304
the presumption is
the driver is negligent.

00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:18,539
When a driver's been drinking
and he hits a pedestrian

00:43:18,606 --> 00:43:21,375
it's no longer negligence,
it's reckless homicide.

00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:25,208
But when a pedestrian
intentionally throws himself

00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:26,376
in front of a moving vehicle

00:43:26,443 --> 00:43:28,144
then the driver's
no longer responsible.

00:43:28,211 --> 00:43:32,515
Legally, he's
off the hook.

00:43:32,582 --> 00:43:35,385
This suicide letter
was written by Bob Martin

00:43:35,452 --> 00:43:36,820
to his wife Charlotte.

00:43:36,886 --> 00:43:39,522
When you hit him
Monday night

00:43:39,589 --> 00:43:41,725
it wasn't an accident.

00:43:52,569 --> 00:43:55,538
You were off the hook.

00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:57,917
Until you let him die.
