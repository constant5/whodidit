Yeah, what's up with that?

Coincidence.
Make anything

Yes, he can.

I can tell

00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,792
he was shot once

wouldn't plume this way.

is illegal in Clark County.

to the chest

00:08:57,741 --> 00:09:00,644

00:09:00,711 --> 00:09:02,041
The others didn't
have stippling

00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,443
on the side of their faces.

00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,395

change direction and stick.

Unless...

00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:19,913
he turned his face away
from the gun.

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,148
Not likely

00:09:21,214 --> 00:09:23,150
due to the origin
of the facial burn.

00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:41,394
Well, the vic had
light brown hair

00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:42,863
so we know it's not his.

00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:44,531
Could be

00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:47,434
Well, that's impossible.

00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:49,269
The amelogenin
on the follicle

00:10:49,336 --> 00:10:52,806
came back XX-- female.

00:10:52,873 --> 00:10:54,808
So, back to that again.

00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,877
Another victim,
or an accomplice?

00:10:56,943 --> 00:10:58,612
Yeah, but what decade?

00:10:58,678 --> 00:11:00,881
What do you mean?

00:11:00,947 --> 00:11:03,517
Look under 400-X.

00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,085
The tag cell
is aged.

00:11:10,123 --> 00:11:12,225
So Millander planted
an aged hair?

00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:14,561
But once exposed,
the tag

00:11:14,628 --> 00:11:17,330
would dry up and fall off,
especially in transport.

00:11:17,397 --> 00:11:18,665
Not if he nurtured it

00:11:18,732 --> 00:11:20,700
kept it in a freezer.

00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:23,136
That would work.

00:11:23,203 --> 00:11:25,105
WILLOWS:
Okay, so what's he

00:11:25,172 --> 00:11:26,506
trying to tell us?

00:11:26,573 --> 00:11:28,675
That he used to kill women?

00:11:28,742 --> 00:11:31,044
Maybe just one.

00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:33,079
Grounds?

00:11:34,414 --> 00:11:36,483
I don't know yet.

00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,486
Is this the car
the guy was killed in?

00:12:14,553 --> 00:12:16,188
He was killed in
the warehouse--

00:12:16,254 --> 00:12:18,390
and don't sneak up
on a person like that.

00:12:18,457 --> 00:12:21,460
Now you know how I feel,
like ten times a day.

00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:23,929
So what's this
Millander guy's thing?

00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:26,965
He saw his dad killed
when he was a kid

00:12:27,032 --> 00:12:28,900
over some money dispute.

00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:31,236
Ends up killing
guys himself.

00:12:33,004 --> 00:12:34,906
Check that out.

00:12:34,973 --> 00:12:37,409
An eight digit number
with a dash.

00:12:37,476 --> 00:12:40,412
Pep Boys receipt?
Dry cleaning tags?

00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:42,080
Well, whatever
it is

00:12:42,147 --> 00:12:43,815
it happened during the summer.

00:12:43,882 --> 00:12:45,851
Paper only burns itself
into plastic

00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:47,185
in high levels of heat.

00:12:47,252 --> 00:12:48,653
So what kind
of paper item

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,822
would you shove
into the center console

00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:52,090
in the heat of summer?

00:12:52,157 --> 00:12:55,460
Something you didn't want.

00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:59,164
Or something you had to keep.

00:12:59,231 --> 00:13:02,200
( <i>pager ringing</i> )

00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,051
Powwow.

00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,653
Later.

00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,291
Nevada State Patrol
found the victim's
vehicle here.

00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,461
Found the body
in Good Springs here.

00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:16,129
Warrick and I found
stippling

00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,031
on the passenger side
seat back.

00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:21,368
WARRICK:
We were thinking Millander
posed as a hitchhiker

00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:24,671
overpowered Walker,
and then faked a
gunshot in the car.

00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,635
I put a call into three area
country and western stations.

00:13:28,702 --> 00:13:30,792
Got the FCC list
for each.

00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:33,996
During the time of the victim's
suicide recording

00:13:34,062 --> 00:13:36,431
KWV had Willie Hank's
"Don't Pay the Ransom"

00:13:36,498 --> 00:13:39,901
playing from 1:47 a.m.
to 1:51 a.m.

00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:41,770
And what time was
sunrise this morning?

00:13:41,837 --> 00:13:43,038
5:13 a.m.

00:13:43,105 --> 00:13:44,773
So that's about
a three hour window.

00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,874
He was racing
daylight.

00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:48,210
WILLOWS:
So in that time he had
to get the recording

00:13:48,276 --> 00:13:49,411
and get rid of the body.

00:13:49,478 --> 00:13:50,679
Made the recording in the car

00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:51,947
killed him in the warehouse.

00:13:52,014 --> 00:13:55,117
No, he carried him
into the warehouse.

00:13:55,183 --> 00:13:55,792
Yeah?

00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:58,333
Mud prints--
one set in, one set out.

00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:00,959
Are we sure he didn't

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,228
kill him
in the car?

00:14:03,295 --> 00:14:05,597
He was shot in the warehouse.

00:14:05,664 --> 00:14:08,266
He was incapacitated in the car.

00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,936
SIDLE:
Okay, how?

00:14:11,002 --> 00:14:12,671
Grissom, you want

00:14:12,737 --> 00:14:14,673
to add something
to this?

00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:20,846
Yeah. None of it matters.

00:14:20,912 --> 00:14:23,115
It's one of those
few cases

00:14:23,181 --> 00:14:25,617
where physical evidence
isn't helping us much.

00:14:25,684 --> 00:14:27,686
I mean, put it in context.

00:14:27,753 --> 00:14:30,088
The victim's birthday is always
on the anniversary

00:14:30,155 --> 00:14:31,823
of the murder
of Millander's father.

00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,391
Staged like his father's death.

00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,460
A planted hair

00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:37,829
a planted
fingerprint

00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:39,965
It's all biographical.

00:14:40,031 --> 00:14:43,535
He's using the evidence
to tell us a story.

00:14:43,602 --> 00:14:44,870
Hey...

00:14:44,936 --> 00:14:47,105
Peter Walker,
our victim

00:14:47,172 --> 00:14:50,509
worked for Cinema Road Services
in Valencia, California.

00:14:50,575 --> 00:14:52,677
Drives the newly released
film reels

00:14:52,744 --> 00:14:54,146
back and forth to Vegas.

00:14:54,212 --> 00:14:56,381
Drops off the new reels
every Tuesday

00:14:56,448 --> 00:14:57,682
for Friday's release.

00:14:57,749 --> 00:14:59,117
Brings the old one back.

00:14:59,184 --> 00:15:01,119
Drives the same route
all the time?

00:15:01,186 --> 00:15:02,921
Yeah, according
to his mileage log.

00:15:02,988 --> 00:15:05,557
Did Walker have
any kind of record?

00:15:05,624 --> 00:15:07,392
BRASS:
Pretty much a boy scout

00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:09,428
except for a speeding ticket.

00:15:09,494 --> 00:15:11,863
Speeding ticket?
How long ago?

00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,065
July 2, last year.

00:15:16,935 --> 00:15:18,470
Summer.

00:15:18,537 --> 00:15:22,407
909987-23...

00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,812
Pete Walker.

00:15:26,878 --> 00:15:27,946
Excessive speed.

00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:30,415
July 2, 2001.

00:15:30,482 --> 00:15:32,184
Walker's birth date's
on the ticket.

00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,251
August 17, 1957.

00:15:33,318 --> 00:15:34,853
Run the other two vics.

00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,954
Royce Harmon.

00:15:37,522 --> 00:15:40,992
WILLOWS:
Employment--
Dinners Delivered.

00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:42,461
Need a car for that.

00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:44,362
What about
his driving record, Jim?

00:15:48,633 --> 00:15:50,969
He drove himself right out
of a license.

00:15:51,036 --> 00:15:53,905
Try Stuart Rampler.

00:15:53,972 --> 00:15:57,008
STOKES:
There's a few tickets.

00:15:57,075 --> 00:15:59,311
Last violation--
excessive speed, June, 2000.

00:15:59,377 --> 00:16:01,146
So what's the commonality?

00:16:01,213 --> 00:16:03,014
Besides birth dates.

00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:05,150
Besides birth dates...

00:16:07,052 --> 00:16:08,854
BRASS:
All the tickets were written

00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,789
by the same cop.

00:16:15,861 --> 00:16:17,262
Excuse me.

00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:20,465
Officer Yarnell?

00:16:20,532 --> 00:16:22,434
Yeah.

00:16:22,501 --> 00:16:25,470
My name's Gil Grissom,
with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:16:25,537 --> 00:16:27,773
May I ask you how many
speeding tickets

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,207
you issue a day?

00:16:29,274 --> 00:16:31,143
Why is it any
business of yours?

00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:34,379
You wrote tickets to three
people who ended up dead.

00:16:34,446 --> 00:16:36,681
You think I had
something to do with it?

00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,651
Look, I'm a good cop.

00:16:39,718 --> 00:16:40,886
I protect and serve.

00:16:40,952 --> 00:16:42,487
I even go to court
on my days off.

00:16:42,554 --> 00:16:45,157
You mean court dates
for speeding tickets?

00:16:45,223 --> 00:16:46,792
Yeah. Sometimes,
believe it or not

00:16:46,858 --> 00:16:47,993
people actually contest them

00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:49,494
and I'm there fighting
it tooth and nail.

00:16:49,561 --> 00:16:50,729
Court.

00:16:50,796 --> 00:16:51,797
Yeah.

00:16:51,863 --> 00:16:54,132
In fact, I just responded
to a challenge this morning.

00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:55,400
Always the same judge?

00:16:55,467 --> 00:16:58,503
No, there's three
traffic court judges.

00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,604
Session's about to start.

00:16:59,671 --> 00:17:00,939
Why don't you go
bother them.

00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:05,510
All rise.

00:17:05,577 --> 00:17:08,713
Honorable Judge Douglas Mason
presiding...

00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,850
Municipal Court,
City of Mulberry

00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:13,618
State of Nevada.

00:17:31,336 --> 00:17:33,138
You may be seated.

00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:48,208
Gil.

00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,417
Excuse me, Officer.

00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:55,885
I'm with the Las Vegas
Crime Lab.

00:17:55,952 --> 00:17:57,653
I need you to arrest
a murder suspect.

00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,822
Where's the suspect?

00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:01,224
Judge Mason.

00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,992
His real name
is Paul Millander.

00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:04,394
You don't want
to do this.

00:18:05,628 --> 00:18:07,463
Sir, please take a seat.

00:18:08,998 --> 00:18:11,234
Officer, this man is not
who he's pretending to be.

00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,668
Take a seat now
or I'll have you

00:18:12,735 --> 00:18:15,204
removed from this courtroom
and charged with contempt.

00:18:15,271 --> 00:18:17,273
He's wanted in
Clark County
for murder.

00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,542
You are now in contempt
of court. Bailiff?

00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:20,943
Come on.

00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,779
I apologize
for the disruption.

00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:25,048
Let's proceed.

00:18:25,114 --> 00:18:26,516
You may be seated, miss.

00:18:26,582 --> 00:18:28,418
You can leave
this court

00:18:28,484 --> 00:18:31,120
when it has concluded
its business.

00:18:34,957 --> 00:18:37,794
Or find yourself in contempt
along with your friend.

00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:51,574
Where are you from?

00:18:51,641 --> 00:18:53,676
You know where
I'm from...

00:18:53,743 --> 00:18:55,611
and I know who you are.

00:18:55,678 --> 00:18:58,247
I'm not who you
think I am.

00:18:58,314 --> 00:19:00,049
Local police have been
out here twice

00:19:00,116 --> 00:19:01,584
this past year
about this man--

00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:02,719
Paul Millander, is it?

00:19:02,785 --> 00:19:06,089
Every time his story's
in the paper.

00:19:06,155 --> 00:19:08,257
I've heard I look
like him.

00:19:08,324 --> 00:19:10,493
Identical.

00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,962
You've heard
of the Doppelganger Syndrome?

00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:16,866
That every person is supposed
to have an exact double

00:19:16,933 --> 00:19:18,601
somewhere in the world?

00:19:18,668 --> 00:19:20,303
Do you believe in it?

00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:21,637
Never been proved.

00:19:21,704 --> 00:19:23,272
A Swiss neurobiologist

00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:27,410
recently published papers
supporting its viability.

00:19:27,477 --> 00:19:29,812
Brugger, I think his name is.

00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:32,115
Stands to reason
this Millander

00:19:32,181 --> 00:19:33,649
is my doppelganger.

00:19:33,716 --> 00:19:34,917
The monkey wrench for you

00:19:34,984 --> 00:19:37,320
is that we're both here
in the state of Nevada.

00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:43,993
Well, you know,
we could always
do a DNA test.

00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,029
You know, if you
keep that up

00:19:47,096 --> 00:19:50,299
people are going
to start calling
you crazy.

00:19:50,366 --> 00:19:52,468
Guard.

00:19:56,806 --> 00:19:58,674
I trust you won't
go near

00:19:58,741 --> 00:20:00,476
my courtroom again.

00:20:04,213 --> 00:20:05,982
Before you go back
to Las Vegas

00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:07,717
why don't you
come to dinner.

00:20:07,784 --> 00:20:10,253
I tell my wife stories
about my day

00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,123
and this one she may
need to hear in person.

00:20:15,525 --> 00:20:17,527
6:00.

00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:19,695
That's my address.

00:20:19,762 --> 00:20:22,298
We live right here
in Mulberry.

00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,036
Any chance
he's got a twin?

00:20:39,102 --> 00:20:41,805
A doppelganger,
evidently.

00:20:41,872 --> 00:20:43,373
Do you have your
mentholatum?

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,575
Why, you getting a cold?

00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:45,576
No.

00:20:45,642 --> 00:20:47,177
The judge just got sloppy.

00:20:47,244 --> 00:20:48,912
Thanks.

00:20:51,248 --> 00:20:53,116
Ah, fuming.

00:20:53,183 --> 00:20:55,552
I'll lift it

00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:57,154
and get it to the lab.

00:20:57,221 --> 00:20:58,041
Go ahead and take
the Tahoe.

00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:58,975
Call me later.

00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:00,243
I'm going to dinner.

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,402
Greg, did you look
at the female hair

00:21:06,469 --> 00:21:08,137
from the crime scene tub?

00:21:08,204 --> 00:21:12,308
When you say "jump,"
I say "how high?"

00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,510
I found testosterone
in female hair.

00:21:14,577 --> 00:21:16,179
Post pubescent
female hair.

00:21:16,245 --> 00:21:18,815
Well, men and women both
have testosterone

00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:19,882
in their systems.

00:21:19,949 --> 00:21:21,117
No big deal, right?

00:21:21,184 --> 00:21:22,351
Well, this is.

00:21:22,418 --> 00:21:25,054
This testosterone's
endogenous.

00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:26,689
What? What do you mean?

00:21:26,756 --> 00:21:28,257
Like outside the body?

00:21:28,324 --> 00:21:30,159
Injections. Supplements.

00:21:31,894 --> 00:21:33,996
So our mystery lady was trying
to enhance

00:21:34,063 --> 00:21:35,398
her athletic performance?

00:21:35,465 --> 00:21:39,369
Or increase her sex drive.

00:21:39,435 --> 00:21:40,970
You know women do that.

00:21:42,205 --> 00:21:43,639
I read.

00:21:43,706 --> 00:21:45,108
None that I've ever met.

00:21:45,174 --> 00:21:46,843
Not yet anyway.

00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:48,378
Okay, I'm not sure

00:21:48,444 --> 00:21:50,680
what this means yet, but thanks.

00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:17,340
( <i>rings doorbell</i> )

00:22:31,187 --> 00:22:32,221
Mr. Grissom?

00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,454
I was admiring
these rain boots.

00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:39,523
Please come in.

00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:46,830
( <i>violin music playing</i> )

00:22:51,502 --> 00:22:52,667
You have a lovely home.

00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,968
We like it.

00:22:55,035 --> 00:22:57,304
May I ask how long
you've lived here?

00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:00,273
We bought the year
we adopted Craig

00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,142
so that would be '92.

00:23:03,877 --> 00:23:06,913
Craig, what did I tell you
you had to do

00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,282
when our dinner guest arrived?

00:23:09,349 --> 00:23:11,051
Hi, I'm Craig Mason.
Nice to meet you.

00:23:11,117 --> 00:23:13,520
Nice to meet you, Craig.

00:23:13,587 --> 00:23:16,656
Want an I.D. tag
for safety?

00:23:16,723 --> 00:23:18,091
Craig's school
is sponsoring

00:23:18,158 --> 00:23:19,459
an identification program

00:23:19,526 --> 00:23:20,494
for students.

00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,429
Parents get one, too.

00:23:22,496 --> 00:23:26,099
Can't be too safe out there,
can we, Mr. Grissom?

00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:29,636
No, we can't.

00:23:29,703 --> 00:23:31,371
Hungry?

00:23:34,441 --> 00:23:35,742
That reminds me, Doug.

00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:38,645
Be sure to tell Mr. Grissom
where you bought your rain
boots.

00:23:38,712 --> 00:23:40,113
He was admiring them earlier.

00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,414
Was he?

00:23:41,481 --> 00:23:43,517
My husband's
only hobby

00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,185
is driving around the state

00:23:45,252 --> 00:23:47,320
looking for bargains,
rain or shine.

00:23:47,387 --> 00:23:49,623
And I tell him,
"You're a judge now.

00:23:49,689 --> 00:23:51,258
We don't need bargains."

00:23:51,324 --> 00:23:54,661
To which I reply,
"Old habits die hard."

00:23:54,728 --> 00:23:56,863
Truth is I think he just enjoys
his private time.

00:23:58,698 --> 00:23:59,800
Dear.

00:24:01,868 --> 00:24:05,539
As a judge I don't want
the outside world privy
to my private life

00:24:05,605 --> 00:24:07,741
because they'll use
it against me.

00:24:11,178 --> 00:24:12,879
You'll be safe now.

00:24:12,946 --> 00:24:14,281
( <i>typing</i> )

00:24:31,865 --> 00:24:33,700
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

00:24:36,703 --> 00:24:38,038
Grissom.

00:24:38,104 --> 00:24:39,940
You're never going to believe

00:24:40,006 --> 00:24:42,309
who Judge Mason's fingerprints
match.

00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:43,376
Judge Mason.

00:24:43,443 --> 00:24:46,613
As printed when he was sworn
before the bar

00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,782
Nevada State Superior Court.

00:24:48,849 --> 00:24:51,151
Okay.

00:24:51,218 --> 00:24:52,486
Thank you.

00:24:55,522 --> 00:24:57,424
My prints came back sound.

00:24:59,092 --> 00:25:00,026
Douglas?

00:25:00,093 --> 00:25:01,828
As I told you
earlier, dear

00:25:01,895 --> 00:25:03,463
Mr. Grissom has confused me

00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,698
with a very bad man.

00:25:04,764 --> 00:25:07,667
I left him fingerprints
so that he could confirm

00:25:07,734 --> 00:25:09,870
that I am
who I say I am.

00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:17,210
Uh, I have to get back
to my lab right away.

00:25:17,277 --> 00:25:18,211
I'm sorry.

00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:19,679
Thank you for a lovely dinner,
Mrs. Mason.

00:25:19,746 --> 00:25:22,949
Craig...

00:25:23,016 --> 00:25:24,751
Your Honor.

00:25:26,686 --> 00:25:29,623
<i>I don't care</i>
<i>what the computer says</i>

00:25:29,689 --> 00:25:31,458
that guy is Paul Millander.

00:25:31,525 --> 00:25:34,060
Yeah, we know that.
How do we prove it?

00:25:34,127 --> 00:25:36,563
We have to disprove
this Judge Mason.

00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,865
Birth certificate--
was he born in Mulberry?

00:25:38,932 --> 00:25:41,368
Well, that's
the first thing
Brass looked into.

00:25:41,434 --> 00:25:44,104
Apparently,
the records building
burned down in 1982.

00:25:44,171 --> 00:25:45,105
Burned down?

00:25:45,172 --> 00:25:47,340
Ruled arson.
No suspects ever found.

00:25:47,407 --> 00:25:50,043
So Judge Mason has
no birth certificate.

00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,244
How convenient.

00:25:51,311 --> 00:25:54,147
Man, this guy plays
way out in front.

00:25:54,214 --> 00:25:55,148
Here's some good news.

00:25:55,215 --> 00:25:56,850
Brass went
to the new records building

00:25:56,917 --> 00:25:58,485
looking for anything
on a Millander.

00:25:58,552 --> 00:26:01,922
Found current
property-tax accounts.

00:26:03,623 --> 00:26:07,360
In the name of Paul
and Isabelle Millander.

00:26:07,427 --> 00:26:09,362
Mm-hmm.

00:26:28,315 --> 00:26:29,716
Isabelle Millander?

00:26:32,085 --> 00:26:34,287
We're with the Las Vegas
crime lab.

00:26:34,354 --> 00:26:36,389
Are you here about my husband?

00:26:36,456 --> 00:26:38,658
That happened over 30 years ago.

00:26:42,262 --> 00:26:44,064
It's our understanding

00:26:44,131 --> 00:26:48,168
that your child witnessed
your husband's murder.

00:26:51,705 --> 00:26:53,039
Thank you.

00:26:55,142 --> 00:26:57,544
My child was only ten years old.

00:26:57,611 --> 00:27:00,413
So brave to testify
against those men.

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,815
But it didn't matter.

00:27:01,882 --> 00:27:05,352
The judge ruled it a suicide
and those men went free.

00:27:05,418 --> 00:27:06,820
I hope we're not interrupting.

00:27:06,887 --> 00:27:09,289
It looks as if you're expecting
someone for dinner.

00:27:09,356 --> 00:27:11,458
I always set

00:27:11,525 --> 00:27:13,026
an extra place for Paul.

00:27:13,093 --> 00:27:14,060
Your son?

00:27:14,127 --> 00:27:16,463
My husband.

00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,898
My way of
being together.

00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,472
Those are
from his best years.

00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:28,208
He started a company
out in Hollywood

00:27:28,275 --> 00:27:29,276
in the 1930s.

00:27:30,777 --> 00:27:32,679
GRISSOM:
<i>Halloweird.</i>

00:27:32,746 --> 00:27:34,481
Movie makeup.
He used himself

00:27:34,548 --> 00:27:36,616
as a model.

00:27:36,683 --> 00:27:37,818
He made hand molds

00:27:37,884 --> 00:27:40,220
<i>and masks, everything.</i>

00:27:40,287 --> 00:27:42,489
Like a one-man
company.

00:27:42,556 --> 00:27:44,157
May I use your bathroom?

00:27:44,224 --> 00:27:45,792
Last door down the hall.

00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:47,527
Would you happen
to have

00:27:47,594 --> 00:27:49,996
any of his work still?

00:27:50,063 --> 00:27:53,767
I kept only what's
most sentimental.

00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:56,937
Might I take
a look at it?

00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:57,097
Hmm, it's rudimentary.

00:28:57,164 --> 00:28:59,399
Almost childlike.

00:28:59,466 --> 00:29:01,835
Our child made it.

00:29:01,902 --> 00:29:03,937
It's an ashtray?

00:29:04,004 --> 00:29:08,875
My husband used his own hand
to imprint the center.

00:29:10,477 --> 00:29:11,845
May I?

00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,000
I wonder what this
green discoloration is.

00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:27,644
I was often curious
about that.

00:29:27,711 --> 00:29:28,542
I could take this

00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:29,943
back to the lab
and analyze it.

00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:33,080
I promise
to bring it back.

00:30:16,792 --> 00:30:19,628
What are you doing
in my daughter's room?

00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:22,231
Oh...

00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:25,534
I have
a daughter myself.

00:30:25,601 --> 00:30:27,303
I was admiring

00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:28,571
the old clothes.

00:30:28,637 --> 00:30:29,905
She's beautiful.

00:30:33,475 --> 00:30:36,111
She died.

00:30:36,178 --> 00:30:38,414
I'm sorry.

00:30:39,415 --> 00:30:40,983
When did she die?

00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:45,354
A long time ago.

00:30:45,421 --> 00:30:48,023
A lifetime ago.

00:30:49,992 --> 00:30:53,229
What about your son Paul?

00:30:53,295 --> 00:30:55,664
I think it's time
for you to go now.

00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:57,066
Mrs. Millander

00:30:57,132 --> 00:30:58,434
we're just trying to clarify...

00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,336
Please?

00:31:07,042 --> 00:31:10,746
So, Paul Millander
killed his sister.

00:31:10,813 --> 00:31:13,449
It's plausible.

00:31:13,516 --> 00:31:15,284
It's not provable...

00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:17,119
yet.

00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,685
SANDERS:
No, you were right.

00:31:30,752 --> 00:31:32,420
The substance <i>isMicrocil-like</i>

00:31:32,487 --> 00:31:35,490
but it's really
old-school-- alginate.

00:31:35,557 --> 00:31:37,492
The book says
that, uh...

00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,961
makeup people
used it up to the '70s

00:31:40,028 --> 00:31:42,063
to make molds
and impressions.

00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,708
It's green, hence the "algin"

00:31:43,708 --> 00:31:45,243
in "alginate."

00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,511
We sold 10,000
of those units

00:31:46,578 --> 00:31:48,213
last Halloween.
Even used

00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,547
my own hand
for the mold.

00:31:49,614 --> 00:31:52,617
These were his father's prints.

00:31:52,684 --> 00:31:55,320
He was planting them
as if they were his own.

00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:03,094
SANDERS:
<i>The guy's pretty shrewd.</i>

00:32:03,161 --> 00:32:05,296
Every murder
comes back to a dead man.

00:32:05,363 --> 00:32:06,965
Greg, if I refer
to Millander

00:32:07,031 --> 00:32:08,566
as smart, it's one thing

00:32:08,633 --> 00:32:11,102
but I mind if
other people do it, okay?

00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:13,004
Got it.

00:32:13,071 --> 00:32:15,940
What have you got on the hair
Catherine recovered?

00:32:16,007 --> 00:32:17,976
Processing it next, sir.

00:32:18,042 --> 00:32:19,511
Find me.

00:32:24,983 --> 00:32:27,252
Did I miss something?

00:32:27,318 --> 00:32:28,486
It's a kid's
fingerprint

00:32:28,553 --> 00:32:29,687
from
the baseball card.

00:32:29,754 --> 00:32:31,789
GRISSOM:
Clear...

00:32:31,856 --> 00:32:33,258
Concise...

00:32:33,324 --> 00:32:34,692
Anonymous.

00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:37,708
Brass found no prints
from little Pauline

00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:39,877
no birth records,
no death certificate.

00:32:39,943 --> 00:32:41,478
I'm going to use the prints

00:32:41,545 --> 00:32:44,782
from the only other kid who
lived in the Millander house.

00:32:44,848 --> 00:32:46,550
Here come de judge.

00:32:50,921 --> 00:32:53,166
Ridge analysis proof.

00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:54,401
Judge Mason <i>is...</i>

00:32:54,467 --> 00:32:56,336
Paul Millander.

00:32:56,403 --> 00:32:57,737
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:33:00,407 --> 00:33:02,342
It's...

00:33:02,409 --> 00:33:03,677
It's Greg.

00:33:03,743 --> 00:33:05,412
Come on.

00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:13,553
Okay.

00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,454
The hair you found

00:33:14,521 --> 00:33:15,989
in Pauline
Millander's bedroom

00:33:16,056 --> 00:33:18,024
Two X chromosomes-- female.

00:33:18,091 --> 00:33:19,426
You didn't beep
me for that.

00:33:19,492 --> 00:33:20,827
Well, Sara had
me compare it

00:33:20,894 --> 00:33:22,762
to the hair
found in the tub

00:33:22,829 --> 00:33:24,130
at the crime scene.

00:33:24,197 --> 00:33:25,832
They're a
perfect match.

00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:28,234
DNA identical.

00:33:28,301 --> 00:33:31,538
So her brother
planted it?

00:33:31,605 --> 00:33:34,574
Well... not exactly.

00:33:34,641 --> 00:33:36,076
Yeah, he planted it.

00:33:36,142 --> 00:33:37,911
He planted his own hair.

00:33:37,978 --> 00:33:39,312
Millander.

00:33:39,379 --> 00:33:42,015
It's a female hair.

00:33:42,082 --> 00:33:44,084
With endogenous testosterone.

00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:47,220
Pauline was taking
male hormone injections.

00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:50,390
Why?

00:33:50,457 --> 00:33:52,058
My theory?

00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:54,227
Sex change.

00:33:54,294 --> 00:33:56,997
You know, when I
was back at the house

00:33:57,063 --> 00:34:00,166
I saw several
photographs of Pauline

00:34:00,233 --> 00:34:01,434
and nothing of Paul.

00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:02,836
In fact,
the only proof

00:34:02,902 --> 00:34:06,806
of Paul is
a hidden baseball card.

00:34:08,575 --> 00:34:10,677
There is no birth or
death record for Pauline.

00:34:10,744 --> 00:34:12,178
Paul killed Pauline.

00:34:13,647 --> 00:34:15,415
But he didn't murder her.

00:34:15,482 --> 00:34:17,684
So that's what
you've been hiding?

00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:20,053
That your daughter
is now your son?

00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,623
Pauline went away and came
back a very strange man.

00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:38,238
And I wouldn't let
him stay here--

00:34:38,305 --> 00:34:39,673
not like that.

00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:42,375
Mrs. Millander, we believe

00:34:42,442 --> 00:34:46,646
that your son
has murdered three people

00:34:46,713 --> 00:34:49,749
and that he's living
under the assumed name

00:34:49,816 --> 00:34:51,451
of Judge Douglas Mason.

00:34:51,518 --> 00:34:54,454
I need your permission
to collect some hairs

00:34:54,521 --> 00:34:57,190
from Pauline's bedroom
for use in court.

00:35:01,861 --> 00:35:03,096
We took this hair

00:35:03,163 --> 00:35:05,165
from your
childhood bedroom

00:35:05,231 --> 00:35:07,467
when you used to be Pauline.

00:35:10,403 --> 00:35:12,339
They told my parents

00:35:12,405 --> 00:35:16,343
I had
an "endocrinic ambiguity."

00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:21,348
My chromosomes said female,
but my body wasn't that sure.

00:35:21,414 --> 00:35:24,818
The doctors told my
parents to raise me

00:35:24,884 --> 00:35:26,419
as they saw fit.

00:35:30,757 --> 00:35:33,760
Unfortunately, they disagreed.

00:35:37,764 --> 00:35:39,032
So, uh...

00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:42,369
You were a girl
when you were inside the house

00:35:42,435 --> 00:35:45,605
and a boy when you
were out in the world?

00:35:46,439 --> 00:35:47,641
I managed.

00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,311
Until...

00:35:53,113 --> 00:35:54,848
that night.

00:36:02,055 --> 00:36:03,189
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:36:11,398 --> 00:36:12,732
A boy...

00:36:15,068 --> 00:36:17,971
<i>could</i> have saved his father.

00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:22,108
You did what you could do.

00:36:22,175 --> 00:36:23,743
You testified
against them.

00:36:25,412 --> 00:36:27,280
Do you see the man who
killed your father

00:36:27,347 --> 00:36:28,548
in this courtroom?

00:36:31,785 --> 00:36:34,454
Y... Yes.

00:36:39,092 --> 00:36:41,428
They went free.

00:36:41,494 --> 00:36:45,632
And you started to identify
with the aggressors.

00:36:50,437 --> 00:36:52,305
Why are you smiling?

00:36:54,107 --> 00:36:55,976
I am...

00:36:56,042 --> 00:36:58,645
comfortable

00:36:58,712 --> 00:37:00,780
sharing this with you.

00:37:02,082 --> 00:37:03,216
My, uh...

00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:08,989
My mother wouldn't hear it.

00:37:09,055 --> 00:37:10,724
Against her wishes

00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:13,226
I cut off my hair.

00:37:13,293 --> 00:37:15,662
Started wearing big shirts.

00:37:15,729 --> 00:37:18,398
Big boots.

00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:23,403
If I got tough enough...

00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:26,673
No one would ever hurt me.

00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,476
I went to the clinic...

00:37:29,542 --> 00:37:31,645
and became a man.

00:37:31,711 --> 00:37:33,680
Sexual reassignment.

00:37:33,747 --> 00:37:36,683
Not just a man,
though-- a judge.

00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,019
Doesn't get much
more powerful than that

00:37:39,085 --> 00:37:40,453
but none of it

00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,356
solved your
problems, did it?

00:37:43,423 --> 00:37:46,826
Or else you wouldn't
have killed three innocent men.

00:37:53,433 --> 00:37:55,769
I have a warrant
for your DNA.

00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:01,942
Identity is so
fluid, you know.

00:38:06,046 --> 00:38:07,347
May I?

00:38:27,734 --> 00:38:29,002
See you in court.

00:38:29,069 --> 00:38:30,537
Aren't you
wondering

00:38:30,604 --> 00:38:33,506
about your birthday?

00:38:33,573 --> 00:38:35,909
August 17, 1956.

00:38:35,976 --> 00:38:37,510
No.

00:38:37,577 --> 00:38:40,413
Why I didn't kill you,
since you were next?

00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,681
No.

00:38:41,748 --> 00:38:43,316
I've already picked

00:38:43,383 --> 00:38:45,785
my next victim,
if you're curious.

00:38:46,786 --> 00:38:50,590
It doesn't matter, Paul--
you'll be in jail.

00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,336
Next up, <i>People v. Landry.</i>

00:39:06,402 --> 00:39:08,838
Are all
the parties present?

00:39:09,542 --> 00:39:10,676
What is going on?

00:39:10,743 --> 00:39:13,333
I thought Millander
was supposed to be
arraigned at 8:00.

00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:14,367
This is just
ridiculous.

00:39:14,434 --> 00:39:16,503
I mean, you'd think
they'd make an exception

00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:17,871
in this case--
three murders.

00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,606
This guy's telling me
that Millander

00:39:19,673 --> 00:39:20,807
is representing himself.

00:39:20,874 --> 00:39:23,210
Pro pers are always
last on the docket.

00:39:52,806 --> 00:39:55,375
BRASS:
A clean-cut guy
in a suit--

00:39:55,442 --> 00:39:57,277
no one looks too close.

00:39:57,344 --> 00:40:00,580
He must have got
a fake I.D.

00:40:00,647 --> 00:40:02,382
He had <i>my</i> I.D.

00:40:19,065 --> 00:40:20,000
You going home?

00:40:20,066 --> 00:40:22,669
Yeah. They know
where to find me.

00:40:22,736 --> 00:40:24,070
I re-read the
backgrounds

00:40:24,137 --> 00:40:25,438
of Millander's victims.

00:40:25,505 --> 00:40:27,007
I think that
he slipped up.

00:40:27,073 --> 00:40:30,777
You know how every victim
read the suicide note

00:40:30,844 --> 00:40:34,347
"I'd like to say
'I love you' to my mother"?

00:40:34,414 --> 00:40:36,283
Well, Pete Walker
had no mother.

00:40:36,349 --> 00:40:37,751
She died in
childbirth.

00:40:40,754 --> 00:40:42,756
He never slips up.

00:41:41,414 --> 00:41:43,083
Mrs. Millander?

00:42:55,689 --> 00:42:58,291
My name is Paul Millander.

00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:02,295
I reside
at 13891 Sand Creek Road.

00:43:02,362 --> 00:43:06,099
I'm 46 years of age
and I'm going to kill myself.

00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:09,069
I'd like to say "I love you"

00:43:09,135 --> 00:43:11,071
to my mother, Isabelle.

00:43:11,137 --> 00:43:12,872
I'm so sorry.

00:43:12,939 --> 00:43:15,208
I never wanted
to put you through this.

00:43:15,275 --> 00:43:17,444
I just can't do it anymore.

00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:20,914
I've lost hope.
