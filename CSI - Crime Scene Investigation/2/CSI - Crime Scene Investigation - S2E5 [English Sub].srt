00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:10,480
You'll like this apartment.

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,948
My wife says
it's the best of the lot.

00:00:12,015 --> 00:00:13,583
Now, the tenants
moved out kind of quick

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,285
so I don't normally
show apartments

00:00:15,351 --> 00:00:17,954
before I've had
a chance to look, so...

00:00:18,021 --> 00:00:20,290
use your imagination.

00:00:27,263 --> 00:00:28,631
WOMAN:
Oh, my God.

00:00:28,698 --> 00:00:30,200
Call 911.

00:00:31,568 --> 00:00:33,670
I worked in a slaughterhouse
one summer.

00:00:33,736 --> 00:00:35,004
Looked a lot like this.

00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:38,308
The lease is in the name
of Clifford Renteria.

00:00:38,374 --> 00:00:39,576
He lived here
with his girlfriend

00:00:39,642 --> 00:00:41,411
till they snuck out
in the middle of the night.

00:00:41,477 --> 00:00:44,314
Gee, I wonder why.

00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,249
For all we know,
this is animal blood.

00:00:46,316 --> 00:00:47,784
BRASS:
Yeah, sure.

00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:50,887
Deer, sheep, llama.

00:00:50,954 --> 00:00:53,556
A deer hunter comes home
from the mountains drunk

00:00:53,623 --> 00:00:55,425
decides to play butcher

00:00:55,491 --> 00:00:57,193
clean his kill.

00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,637
Chops his game up
into oven-sized pieces for the winter.

00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:03,199
I mean, what does he care?
He's renting.

00:01:06,636 --> 00:01:08,137
BRASS:
Victim's human.

00:01:08,204 --> 00:01:11,261
And a human has only
eight pints of blood.

00:01:11,328 --> 00:01:13,163
So, whoever the victim is...

00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,332
is now dead.

SIDLE:
Any uniformity in the spray?

00:01:53,457 --> 00:01:55,192
GRISSOM:
Well, by and large,
the average diameter

00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,994
is about one millimeter.

00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:58,963
SIDLE:
Blood drops this size

00:01:59,029 --> 00:02:02,066
are characteristic of
high-velocity impact

00:02:02,132 --> 00:02:03,467
like gunshot trauma

00:02:03,534 --> 00:02:06,670
but there's no bullet
strikes on the walls...

00:02:06,737 --> 00:02:09,039
ruling out murder by gun.

00:02:09,106 --> 00:02:10,608
Just acquaint yourself, Sara.

00:02:10,674 --> 00:02:12,476
Don't interpret just yet, okay?

00:02:17,948 --> 00:02:19,350
All right.

00:02:22,887 --> 00:02:23,954
Show time.

00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:34,365
This looks
like a multiple.

00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:35,366
More than one vic.

00:02:35,432 --> 00:02:36,400
Acquainting myself.

00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:37,968
Check out these "voids."

00:02:38,035 --> 00:02:39,637
That's the real evidence.

00:02:39,703 --> 00:02:40,971
Couch?

00:02:41,038 --> 00:02:43,941
We've only got 30 seconds
till this luminol disappears.

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,315
Television, maybe?

00:02:51,382 --> 00:02:54,084
A magazine?

00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:55,753
Triangle...

00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:58,389
coat rack?

00:02:58,455 --> 00:03:00,157
Guys...

00:03:05,162 --> 00:03:07,264
What do you think
that is?

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,869
Looks like it could be
an electric saw.

00:03:13,938 --> 00:03:16,040
High-velocity,
small spray.

Zero humidity,

00:03:40,865 --> 00:03:42,266
'Tis the season.

00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,001
You left out the hot firemen.

00:03:45,703 --> 00:03:46,637
Hi.

00:03:46,704 --> 00:03:47,838
Hey.

00:03:47,905 --> 00:03:50,841
I don't even know where
to start with this one.

00:03:50,908 --> 00:03:53,210
Take a look at that.

00:03:53,277 --> 00:03:56,013
A scuba diver...
up a tree.

00:03:57,715 --> 00:03:59,683
Wow.

00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,819
WILLOWS:
I wonder how he got up there.

00:04:03,754 --> 00:04:05,055
STOKES:
He couldn't have
climbed up there

00:04:05,122 --> 00:04:06,156
with all that crap on.

00:04:06,223 --> 00:04:09,560
He got up there somehow.

00:04:09,627 --> 00:04:11,295
Well, you know...

00:04:11,362 --> 00:04:12,997
Lake Mead is just
over the hill

00:04:13,063 --> 00:04:14,965
and the copters
are dropping water.

00:04:15,032 --> 00:04:16,767
( <i>helicopter whirring</i> )

00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:22,239
You're serious?

00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:26,477
That's a total urban legend.

00:04:26,544 --> 00:04:29,180
We're scientists, Nickie.

00:04:29,246 --> 00:04:30,347
No way that happened.

00:04:30,414 --> 00:04:31,949
Okay.

00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:38,389
And I suppose
you believe in Santa?

00:04:38,455 --> 00:04:41,592
After today...

00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:43,527
oh, yeah.

00:04:45,262 --> 00:04:47,498
When I said Cliff Renteria
and his girlfriend

00:04:47,565 --> 00:04:49,667
skipped out in the middle
of the night

00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:51,068
I didn't have the whole story.

00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:53,003
I haven't seen Alison
in over a month.

00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,972
Any idea where
she might be?

00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:57,107
Renteria said
she left town.

00:04:57,174 --> 00:04:59,076
So you noticed
that she was gone?

00:04:59,143 --> 00:05:00,578
I manage the complex.

00:05:00,644 --> 00:05:01,779
I notice everything.

00:05:01,846 --> 00:05:03,280
Did you notice
if Mr. Renteria

00:05:03,347 --> 00:05:04,615
left a forwarding
address?

00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:06,684
No. He just wrote
the letter saying
he was moving on.

00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,952
Listen, if you find him

00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:10,421
you tell him he is not getting
his deposit back, okay?

00:05:10,487 --> 00:05:11,555
The blood'll never come out.

00:05:11,622 --> 00:05:13,257
Hopefully not.

00:05:13,324 --> 00:05:15,426
That's all the evidence we have.

00:05:15,492 --> 00:05:17,494
( <i>helicopter whirring</i> )

00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:40,484
What do you make of that void?

00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:43,587
Green vegetation.

00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,326
There's a consistent burn
over this whole area.

00:05:49,393 --> 00:05:51,595
Except for that one spot.

00:05:53,497 --> 00:05:55,933
Well, the chief says the
original fire was a class "C."

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,001
Downed power line.

00:05:57,067 --> 00:05:59,703
Winds keep shifting

00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,206
hot spots breaking
out all over.

00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,508
STOKES:
Well, well...

00:06:04,575 --> 00:06:07,711
Downed power line, huh?

00:06:12,516 --> 00:06:14,652
Good eye.

00:06:14,718 --> 00:06:17,121
STOKES:
Matchbook time-delay device.

00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:20,591
Don't touch it.

00:06:20,658 --> 00:06:23,427
It'll disintegrate.

00:06:23,494 --> 00:06:27,498
That's the only reason
I carry this stuff.

00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:29,400
WILLOWS:
Hair spray.

00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:30,868
Extra hold?

00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,243
The difference between
walking and running.

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,079
Guy lights a cigarette,
sticks it in a matchbook

00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:43,180
takes a stroll.

00:06:47,284 --> 00:06:49,920
It buys an arsonist
a five-minute head start.

00:06:49,987 --> 00:06:51,322
Mm-hmm.

00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,658
Monaco Receiving.

00:06:54,725 --> 00:06:57,461
Clifford Renteria,
Platform Manager.

00:06:57,528 --> 00:06:59,964
Gee, Brass,
all in one shift.

00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,465
I'm impressed.

00:07:01,532 --> 00:07:03,167
BRASS:
Are you
Clifford Renteria?

00:07:03,234 --> 00:07:04,201
Cliff.

00:07:04,268 --> 00:07:05,536
Who are you?

00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:08,539
Las Vegas Police.

00:07:08,606 --> 00:07:10,908
With the Crime Lab.

00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:12,176
Do you have
any knowledge

00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:14,044
of the whereabouts
of Alison Scott?

00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:17,214
She's in Canada
visiting her parents. Why?

00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:20,751
We just came
from your old apartment.

00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:23,420
We found some disturbing
evidence there.

00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:25,523
Would you care
to explain that?

00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:26,891
Hey, he had it coming.

00:07:26,957 --> 00:07:28,659
I'll tell you that
right now.

00:07:28,726 --> 00:07:32,029
Apartment stank, there were
flies everywhere, no water.

00:07:32,096 --> 00:07:33,664
So I trashed the place.

00:07:33,731 --> 00:07:34,765
Who had it coming?

00:07:34,832 --> 00:07:35,833
The apartment manager.

00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,568
The lazy bastard.

00:07:37,635 --> 00:07:38,702
Serves him right.

00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:39,770
GRISSOM:
Mr. Renteria

00:07:39,837 --> 00:07:43,541
your apartment walls
are covered in human blood.

00:07:43,607 --> 00:07:45,576
Are you aware
of that?

00:07:45,643 --> 00:07:46,610
Yeah.

00:07:46,677 --> 00:07:48,179
Do you have
an explanation?

00:07:48,245 --> 00:07:49,446
It's my blood.

00:07:49,513 --> 00:07:50,514
Your blood?

00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:51,916
You got a stigmata?

00:07:51,982 --> 00:07:54,418
No. I get nosebleeds.

00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:55,719
Nosebleeds?

00:07:55,786 --> 00:07:56,921
From hepatitis C.

00:07:56,987 --> 00:07:58,088
I got blood to spare.

00:07:58,155 --> 00:08:00,324
My nose is like Old Faithful.

00:08:00,391 --> 00:08:02,359
Finally came in handy.

00:08:02,426 --> 00:08:04,061
You expirated blood
from your nose

00:08:04,128 --> 00:08:07,031
all over your apartment walls
to get back at your manager?

00:08:07,097 --> 00:08:08,499
Yeah.

00:08:08,566 --> 00:08:10,467
I hope I made
his cleanup job hell.

00:08:10,534 --> 00:08:14,305
That's not supposed
to go anywhere.

00:08:16,707 --> 00:08:18,042
This guy blows

00:08:18,108 --> 00:08:20,911
ten quarts of blood
from his nose onto his wall?

00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:23,080
You want to ask
for a demonstration?

00:08:23,147 --> 00:08:24,281
He's lying.

00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:26,116
Expirating from your nose

00:08:26,183 --> 00:08:28,953
would leave oval-shaped
blood patterns.

00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:31,055
The ones we found
in his apartment

00:08:31,121 --> 00:08:33,290
were V-shaped.

00:08:33,357 --> 00:08:34,825
Mr. Renteria.

00:08:38,128 --> 00:08:39,964
We're going to need
a sample of your blood--

00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,499
from your arm,
not your nose--

00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:44,435
and a visit
to your new apartment.

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,638
That's home to me now.

00:08:47,705 --> 00:08:50,441
Been staying there
about a week.

00:08:50,507 --> 00:08:52,643
Well, may we see your furniture?

00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,645
Sure.

00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,191
GRISSOM:
Electric saw.

00:09:07,258 --> 00:09:10,361
Used to do some landscaping.

00:09:12,012 --> 00:09:13,831
GRISSOM:
Interesting lamp.

00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:18,769
Mr. Renteria, with
your permission

00:09:18,836 --> 00:09:21,405
I'd like to move
some of your property

00:09:21,472 --> 00:09:23,741
to my lab for
a closer inspection.

00:09:23,807 --> 00:09:25,809
Hey, save me 250 a week
truck rental.

00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:27,444
Keep it as long as you want.

00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:28,979
I'll sleep in the break room.

00:09:29,046 --> 00:09:30,648
That's after
you come down

00:09:30,714 --> 00:09:32,716
and give us
that blood sample.

00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,627
You check nosebleed's
tools yet?

00:09:43,694 --> 00:09:44,695
No observable blood.

00:09:44,762 --> 00:09:45,829
Not even with Pheno.

00:09:45,896 --> 00:09:48,732
That's because
he probably ditched them

00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,067
after using them
on the victim.

00:09:50,134 --> 00:09:52,169
Now we've just got to
figure out which one.

00:09:53,337 --> 00:09:55,673
How long did Firearms
give us these for?

00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:59,143
24 hours, then we've got
to get them back. Clean.

00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,879
Let's do it.

00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,042
GRISSOM:
So?

00:10:33,077 --> 00:10:34,411
DNA results, um...

00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:38,015
16 samples from
the apartment walls

00:10:38,082 --> 00:10:40,117
and the one we just took
from the guy's arm.

00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:46,423
This cannot be right.

00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,026
Hey, I always
double-check your stuff.

00:10:49,093 --> 00:10:50,961
But all the results
are pointing one way.

00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:52,563
What about the blood
on the lamp?

00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,931
That is my next run.

00:10:53,998 --> 00:10:55,699
Just a little backlogged.

00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:57,935
Well, get through it.

00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,540
I thought you said the blood
on those walls couldn't be his.

00:11:02,606 --> 00:11:05,209
I also thought
the metric system
would catch on.

00:11:05,276 --> 00:11:06,677
Look, everything
that starts

00:11:06,744 --> 00:11:08,746
with a faulty premise
is bound to fail.

00:11:08,812 --> 00:11:12,716
I saw "V" patterns
and I foolishly
ruled out the nose.

00:11:12,783 --> 00:11:14,685
I told you I had
a condition, hepatitis C.

00:11:14,752 --> 00:11:16,287
I was diagnosed
when I was 18.

00:11:16,353 --> 00:11:18,389
And this relates
to your magic nose, how?

00:11:18,455 --> 00:11:20,591
Hepatitis C
destroys the liver

00:11:20,658 --> 00:11:23,827
and a whole host of
clotting functions.

00:11:23,894 --> 00:11:26,764
Cliff, indeed,
has blood to spare.

00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,466
Thanks for coming around
to my side.

00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:31,302
Which way is out?

00:11:31,368 --> 00:11:33,837
Nobody released you.

00:11:33,904 --> 00:11:36,240
Mr. Renteria,
I can't sign
off on a case

00:11:36,307 --> 00:11:37,942
until I fully
understand it.

00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:39,677
So, let me get
this straight.

00:11:39,743 --> 00:11:41,645
You had a beef
with your landlord

00:11:41,712 --> 00:11:43,581
and you decided to pay him back

00:11:43,647 --> 00:11:46,684
by blowing blood out
of your nose

00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,185
all over the apartment walls.

00:11:48,252 --> 00:11:49,787
Is that about right?

00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:50,988
Yeah.

00:11:51,055 --> 00:11:53,490
A day? A week?
A couple of months?

00:11:53,557 --> 00:11:55,259
How long did this take?

00:11:55,326 --> 00:11:56,260
I don't know.

00:11:56,327 --> 00:11:58,128
About a month.

00:11:58,195 --> 00:12:00,331
So, you get up
in the morning,
make coffee and go

00:12:00,397 --> 00:12:02,666
"I think I'll blow some blood
on the kitchen wall today."

00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:04,335
Get out of
the shower

00:12:04,401 --> 00:12:05,402
grab your towel, go

00:12:05,469 --> 00:12:07,938
"Hey, this looks like
a nice spot to expirate

00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:09,273
a couple of pints."

00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,574
It wasn't like that.

00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:12,843
Something would set me off.

00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,445
The disposal was backed up,
no hot water

00:12:14,512 --> 00:12:15,613
the toilet was broken...

00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:18,449
I knew the landlord
wasn't going to fix it.

00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:22,853
So, you made your statement
through your nose?

00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,155
I wasn't getting anywhere
with words.

00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:26,790
Look, if it'll get me

00:12:26,857 --> 00:12:29,593
out of here any quicker,
I'll show you.

00:12:31,095 --> 00:12:33,097
Um...

00:12:35,766 --> 00:12:38,435
It's really not that big a deal.

00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,542
You might want to back up.

00:12:49,446 --> 00:12:53,851
SIDLE:
Same high-velocity spray.

00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:55,819
Same short "V" pattern, too.

00:12:55,886 --> 00:12:59,590
Didn't you say expirating
through the nose
made oval patterns?

00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:02,426
Yeah, well, as it turns out

00:13:02,493 --> 00:13:05,429
our guy stands very close
to the wall

00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:07,865
and blows almost sideways.

00:13:07,932 --> 00:13:09,033
This is on the real.

00:13:09,099 --> 00:13:10,201
You actually saw him do this?

00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:12,336
Right through his Jimmy Durante.

00:13:12,403 --> 00:13:14,438
Ambidextrous, both nostrils.

00:13:14,505 --> 00:13:15,573
Great.

00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:16,907
Our big murder's a nosebleed.

00:13:16,974 --> 00:13:18,909
Oh, not necessarily.

00:13:18,976 --> 00:13:21,245
Sample from the
nosebleed's lamp.

00:13:21,312 --> 00:13:22,913
It's not his blood.

00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,715
And I don't know
whose blood it is

00:13:24,782 --> 00:13:28,452
but the Amelogenin
came back with something
pretty interesting: "XX."

00:13:29,386 --> 00:13:30,428
Female blood.

00:13:30,855 --> 00:13:32,690
Our guy's girlfriend
is still missing.

00:13:32,756 --> 00:13:35,025
Two things which may have
nothing to do with each other.

00:13:35,092 --> 00:13:36,160
Or everything.

00:13:47,386 --> 00:13:49,822
So you got an ID
on the scuba guy?

00:13:49,888 --> 00:13:52,224
Jacques Cousteau.

00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,892
Kidding.

00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,527
Coroner humor.

00:13:55,594 --> 00:13:57,763
But I'll tell you
what I do know.

00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,665
He didn't die in that fire.

00:13:59,732 --> 00:14:02,762
No carboxyhemoglobin
in his blood.

00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:05,265
Means he didn't inhale
any carbon monoxide.

00:14:05,331 --> 00:14:07,867
Tells us he stopped breathing
before the fire started.

00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:10,170
Guy was probably killed
someplace else and dumped.

00:14:10,236 --> 00:14:11,738
Oh, he was dumped all right...

00:14:11,805 --> 00:14:13,106
out of a chopper.

00:14:13,173 --> 00:14:14,207
Right, Doc?

00:14:14,274 --> 00:14:18,595
Victim's injuries are inconsistent
with a fall of that magnitude.

00:14:18,762 --> 00:14:20,386
No fracture
of the pelvis

00:14:20,386 --> 00:14:22,615
no compression of
the lumbar vertebrae

00:14:22,682 --> 00:14:26,186
no shortening
of the body.

00:14:26,252 --> 00:14:28,261
There goes your theory, Nick.

00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:30,490
Good try though.

00:14:30,557 --> 00:14:32,325
So what was the cause of death?

00:14:32,392 --> 00:14:33,893
His heart stopped beating.

00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,331
Heart attack... consistent with
being scooped out of Lake Mead.

00:14:38,398 --> 00:14:41,000
The human heart beats
in a four-beat rhythm

00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:42,202
like a fox-trot.

00:14:42,268 --> 00:14:45,004
The two atria contract,
then the two ventricles.

00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:46,740
Ba-boom, ba-boom.

00:14:46,806 --> 00:14:48,308
So, what happened to this guy?

00:14:48,374 --> 00:14:51,411
<i>Commotio cordis.</i>
Cardiac concussion.

00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:53,847
The guy short-circuited.

00:14:53,913 --> 00:14:55,348
It's rare, but I've seen it.

00:14:55,415 --> 00:14:56,516
Couple of years ago

00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,953
a Minor Leaguer
took a line drive to the chest.

00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:02,455
<i>Interrupted the impulse</i>
<i>to the heart</i>

00:15:02,522 --> 00:15:05,225
<i>turning it into a bag of worms.</i>
<i>Fibrillation.</i>

00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:08,695
So, our scuba diver
took one to the chest.

00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:09,829
Definitely.

00:15:09,896 --> 00:15:10,964
He could've been clipped

00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,000
by the chopper's bambi bucket.

00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:16,836
Did you find anything
between his toes?

00:15:16,903 --> 00:15:18,304
Like sand from...

00:15:18,371 --> 00:15:20,407
Lake Mead.
Sorry, Nick.

00:15:20,473 --> 00:15:23,443
But I did find something
between him and his wetsuit.

00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,778
Soap residue.

00:15:24,844 --> 00:15:26,613
Like he started to shower.

00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:27,680
Soaped up

00:15:27,747 --> 00:15:29,149
never soaped off.

00:15:37,824 --> 00:15:40,060
Something on
your mind, Greg?

00:15:40,126 --> 00:15:42,595
No. I heard
about your case.

00:15:42,662 --> 00:15:44,164
Sounds interesting.

00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,132
Yeah.

00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,234
You want to make
yourself useful

00:15:48,301 --> 00:15:50,637
drop this off at Trace.

00:15:50,703 --> 00:15:52,105
Must be some kind of soap.

00:15:52,172 --> 00:15:53,807
Robbins got me halfway there.

00:15:53,873 --> 00:15:56,276
Bet it's liquid
dishwashing soap.

00:15:56,342 --> 00:15:58,078
Yeah, state your source.

00:15:58,144 --> 00:16:00,313
Well, you know

00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,282
I used to do a little
diving myself actually.

00:16:02,348 --> 00:16:03,983
Belize, Maui

00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,486
Great Barrier Reef.

00:16:06,553 --> 00:16:10,557
Okay, maybe I took that
one a little too far.

00:16:10,623 --> 00:16:12,459
But the point is,
that these rubber suits

00:16:12,525 --> 00:16:14,561
aren't very easy to put on.

00:16:14,627 --> 00:16:17,163
Neoprene and skin
need a little romance
to get together.

00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,200
And a capful of liquid
soap works like a charm.

00:16:22,836 --> 00:16:26,506
So, you want to check
this safety valve?

00:16:26,573 --> 00:16:29,008
Sealed closed.

00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:30,977
And what about
the pressure gauge?

00:16:31,044 --> 00:16:32,378
Hose melted.

00:16:32,445 --> 00:16:34,581
Catherine found it at
the base of the tree.

00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:37,917
It's 3,000 psi;
that tank was full.

00:16:37,984 --> 00:16:39,452
Guess it's like
anything pressurized.

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,155
These things blow for
one of two reasons:

00:16:42,222 --> 00:16:44,858
Too much air
or too much heat.

00:16:48,995 --> 00:16:51,097
You just made yourself
useful, my friend.

00:16:51,164 --> 00:16:53,066
Yeah?
Oh, yeah.

00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:54,401
How?

00:16:55,935 --> 00:16:57,404
What are we
looking for exactly?

00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,172
Same thing we're
always looking for

00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:00,473
evidence of a crime.

00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,609
Failing that, we'll
have to release
this apartment.

00:17:02,675 --> 00:17:04,611
What about Nose Bleed's
missing girlfriend?

00:17:04,677 --> 00:17:05,745
You heard Brass.

00:17:05,812 --> 00:17:08,281
He got ahold of Alison
Scott's parents in Canada.

00:17:08,348 --> 00:17:09,582
They said
she never arrived.

00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:11,684
They had no idea she was
even going to see them.

00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:21,161
What if Nose Man blew blood
all over these walls

00:17:21,227 --> 00:17:23,630
to cover up Alison
Scott's blood?

00:17:42,716 --> 00:17:44,350
I don't see
any evidence of that.

00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:46,553
You're not finding another layer
of blood under there?

00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:47,520
No.

00:17:47,587 --> 00:17:48,555
You don't think maybe

00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:50,223
he offed his girlfriend?

00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,892
( <i>fly buzzing</i> )

00:17:55,528 --> 00:17:57,897
How many flies do you
count in this room?

00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:05,872
15, give or take.

00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:08,541
I counted four on my
first walk-through.

00:18:10,076 --> 00:18:11,678
Fly spots.

00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:13,646
Regurgitations.

00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:29,729
Fresh.

00:18:29,796 --> 00:18:31,097
Problem is

00:18:31,164 --> 00:18:34,367
flies don't feast
on dry blood.

00:18:34,434 --> 00:18:37,137
Place is sealed, and they don't
spontaneously generate.

00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:42,008
So they're feeding
on fresh blood.

00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:45,645
Could be a rodent, though,
or bad garbage.

00:18:45,712 --> 00:18:47,747
Or it could be something
higher up the food chain

00:18:47,814 --> 00:18:49,349
like Alison Scott.

00:19:03,363 --> 00:19:07,400
The preponderance of
flies is in this room.

00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:11,871
They can egress a space
less than .001 centimeters.

00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:14,741
Behind you.

00:19:14,808 --> 00:19:16,643
Vent.

00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:26,753
Hey, coffee boy.

00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,854
Where's my DNA?

00:19:27,921 --> 00:19:29,022
Cigarette butt?

00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:31,091
Match book time-delay device?
Hair spray?

00:19:31,157 --> 00:19:32,525
Any of this sound familiar?

00:19:32,592 --> 00:19:35,695
Bags under the eyes,
coffee cups, stress face.

00:19:35,762 --> 00:19:37,397
Any of this look familiar?

00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:40,533
I'm working on it.

00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,470
Did Grissom put his stuff
in front of mine?

00:19:43,536 --> 00:19:45,004
No.

00:19:45,071 --> 00:19:47,373
I'm working on your case--
with Nick.

00:19:52,245 --> 00:19:54,681
I just talked
with your partner.

00:19:54,748 --> 00:19:55,815
Working this case
without me, huh?

00:19:55,882 --> 00:19:56,916
Hmm?

00:19:56,983 --> 00:19:58,485
Greg Sanders?

00:19:58,551 --> 00:20:00,487
Let go my Grego.

00:20:00,553 --> 00:20:01,921
He's a CSI wannabe.

00:20:01,988 --> 00:20:03,223
Please.

00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:06,059
Check out the bottom
of this tank.

00:20:07,694 --> 00:20:08,928
Fissure.

00:20:08,995 --> 00:20:11,664
We had a little
explosion here.

00:20:11,731 --> 00:20:13,333
That explains a lot.

00:20:15,935 --> 00:20:18,671
Acid etching.
Not bad.

00:20:18,738 --> 00:20:20,707
Figure if I can get
the serial number
off the tank

00:20:20,774 --> 00:20:22,242
get on the horn
with some surf shops

00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:23,877
track the renter
through a credit card.

00:20:23,943 --> 00:20:28,415
Pretty smart thinking
there, partner.

00:20:29,616 --> 00:20:33,286
Well, we still haven't
ID'd the vic, but...

00:20:33,353 --> 00:20:36,022
it's worth a shot.

00:20:38,391 --> 00:20:41,861
Okay, N-4-0-0-2, let's see
what kind of lead you are.

00:20:43,797 --> 00:20:46,699
Hi. Uh, whatever you're selling,
I have no interest, okay.

00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:49,769
Maybe you should find out
what we're selling first.

00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,473
I'm Catherine Willows,
Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,607
Detective O'Riley.

00:20:54,674 --> 00:20:56,776
Is there a Jerry Walden
lives here?

00:20:56,843 --> 00:20:58,878
You're looking at him.

00:21:01,014 --> 00:21:02,615
What?

00:21:02,682 --> 00:21:04,818
Are you missing a scuba tank?

00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,829
So, let me get this straight,
Mr. Walden.

00:21:15,895 --> 00:21:18,498
You lent Bruce Skeller
a spare tank.

00:21:18,565 --> 00:21:19,499
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:21:19,566 --> 00:21:22,235
Yeah.

00:21:22,302 --> 00:21:25,238
I just, I can't believe
what you're telling me here.

00:21:25,305 --> 00:21:27,907
I mean, Bruce was
an experienced diver.

00:21:27,974 --> 00:21:31,010
Well, he didn't exactly
die in the water.

00:21:33,213 --> 00:21:35,782
Bruce and I were about

00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:37,884
to break ground
on this project.

00:21:37,951 --> 00:21:39,686
Really meant a lot to him.

00:21:39,753 --> 00:21:41,488
You guys were
in business together?

00:21:41,554 --> 00:21:44,391
We've been best friends
since we were kids.

00:21:44,457 --> 00:21:46,292
We used to

00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:48,194
build these forts together

00:21:48,261 --> 00:21:50,296
like our imaginary casino,
you know?

00:21:50,363 --> 00:21:53,566
Now we were going
to build the real thing.

00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:56,236
We partnered up with this big
development company Adventures.

00:21:56,302 --> 00:21:58,071
Excuse me.

00:21:58,138 --> 00:22:01,408
You said that Mr. Skeller
was an experienced diver.

00:22:01,474 --> 00:22:03,243
Why would he
be borrowing a tank?

00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:05,311
Well, just because
somebody's experienced

00:22:05,378 --> 00:22:07,914
doesn't make them any less
of a freeloader.

00:22:07,981 --> 00:22:10,350
He was just down
on his luck.

00:22:10,417 --> 00:22:12,185
But, as I say,
we were like brothers.

00:22:12,252 --> 00:22:13,686
I mean, we shared everything.

00:22:13,753 --> 00:22:15,955
What was mine was his,
what was his was mine.

00:22:16,022 --> 00:22:18,024
But you just said
he didn't have anything.

00:22:18,091 --> 00:22:20,527
Yeah, but he
would've, you know.

00:22:20,593 --> 00:22:21,928
And I kept
telling him that.

00:22:21,995 --> 00:22:23,730
I mean, that's
what kept him going.

00:22:23,797 --> 00:22:24,964
And then this happened.

00:22:25,031 --> 00:22:27,300
There used to be something here.

00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:29,936
Oh, yeah, it's my coffee table.

00:22:30,003 --> 00:22:32,338
Interesting furniture.
What is that, ash wood?

00:22:32,405 --> 00:22:33,773
Yeah.

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,974
Is that what

00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:36,276
the coffee table
was made out of?

00:22:36,342 --> 00:22:38,611
Made them out of
the same piece of wood.

00:22:38,678 --> 00:22:40,046
Where is the coffee table?

00:22:40,113 --> 00:22:42,782
Oh, I sent it out
to get it refinished.

00:22:42,849 --> 00:22:46,486
The guy said it would
be back in a week.

00:22:48,121 --> 00:22:49,322
I, uh...

00:22:51,424 --> 00:22:55,195
...think it needed
a little more than that.

00:23:05,371 --> 00:23:07,474
Fly egg casings.

00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,143
I thought I heard
some banging around.

00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,645
You, uh, you
find my tenant?

00:23:12,712 --> 00:23:16,483
You can contact Captain Brass
for that information, sir.

00:23:23,123 --> 00:23:24,491
What do you got?

00:23:24,557 --> 00:23:26,893
Either Paul or John.

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,561
A very important beetle.

00:23:28,628 --> 00:23:29,896
The most important.

00:23:29,963 --> 00:23:32,499
The Silphid Beetle
typically feeds

00:23:32,565 --> 00:23:34,501
on decomposing human flesh.

00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:36,503
There's a dead body
in here somewhere.

00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:37,971
Mr. Evans...

00:23:39,773 --> 00:23:41,374
...could you get permission
from the owner

00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:42,909
to let us break
into these walls?

00:23:42,976 --> 00:23:44,878
Our original warrant
didn't cover that.

00:23:44,944 --> 00:23:48,114
Depends, how many walls
and what for?

00:23:48,181 --> 00:23:49,816
We can't divulge that

00:23:49,883 --> 00:23:52,852
but it may be...
all the walls.

00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:54,220
In every room?

00:23:54,287 --> 00:23:56,056
Yeah.

00:23:56,122 --> 00:23:58,391
You CSI's going to pay
for the replastering?

00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:01,461
We don't do that.

00:24:01,528 --> 00:24:04,097
But you can submit a form
to the city for reimbursement.

00:24:04,164 --> 00:24:06,032
Yeah, I'm still waiting
for my tax rebate.

00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:08,101
I don't even have to bother
the owner with this.

00:24:08,168 --> 00:24:10,870
He's not going to let you
bust out these walls.

00:24:14,674 --> 00:24:16,076
Now what?

00:24:16,142 --> 00:24:18,311
DNA lab.

00:24:18,378 --> 00:24:20,680
I don't want to hear any
rumors that Paul is dead.

00:24:20,747 --> 00:24:22,082
He may be the only
chance we have

00:24:22,148 --> 00:24:23,550
of getting in these walls.

00:24:24,928 --> 00:24:27,063
We already know this beetle
feeds only off

00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:30,133
of human blood, so why
are we extracting
its stomach contents?

00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,468
Not so.

00:24:31,534 --> 00:24:33,103
According to Grissom--
Mr. Bug Guy

00:24:33,169 --> 00:24:37,887
the Silphid beetle will actually feed on
any decomposing mammal.

00:24:37,907 --> 00:24:40,928
So we need to show
human DNA

00:24:40,928 --> 00:24:43,095
or we are not
going to get a warrant

00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:44,678
to break down those walls.

00:24:44,745 --> 00:24:47,614
Well, I hope he got
his grub before you
grabbed him up.

00:24:47,681 --> 00:24:48,615
Where's Greg?

00:24:48,682 --> 00:24:49,883
We need to get
this processed.

00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,352
You know, I swear that guy
has a second job somewhere.

00:24:57,758 --> 00:25:00,260
I'm, uh, all for
being alone, but...

00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:01,929
Did you bring
the file?

00:25:01,995 --> 00:25:03,764
Well, there goes
the foreplay.

00:25:03,831 --> 00:25:04,765
It's in the car.

00:25:04,832 --> 00:25:06,133
I hope you appreciate

00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,668
that even as
District Engineer

00:25:07,735 --> 00:25:10,237
it wasn't easy getting you
the original land deed.

00:25:10,304 --> 00:25:12,206
Well, I know how
you love a challenge.

00:25:12,272 --> 00:25:13,874
So, what'd
the property sell for?

00:25:13,941 --> 00:25:16,577
Half a million bucks
an acre.

00:25:16,643 --> 00:25:19,079
Is there anything
else that you need
to use me for?

00:25:20,345 --> 00:25:21,137
Excuse me?

00:25:21,137 --> 00:25:22,845
It's obvious that
you're not here for me.

00:25:22,845 --> 00:25:23,484
You're here for yourself.

00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,686
So let's not waste
each other's time, all right?

00:25:25,753 --> 00:25:27,688
The property was owned
jointly by two men--

00:25:27,755 --> 00:25:29,156
Jerry Walden
and Bruce Skeller.

00:25:29,223 --> 00:25:30,924
At the time that
they bought it

00:25:30,991 --> 00:25:32,893
it was a steal--
50 grand an acre.

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,095
Two years later,
Adventures Development

00:25:35,162 --> 00:25:37,470
comes in, they start
buying up the surrounding parcels.

00:25:38,031 --> 00:25:39,800
Your guys hold out,
until last week

00:25:39,867 --> 00:25:42,002
and let me tell you,
they got top dollar.

00:25:42,069 --> 00:25:45,105
Capitalist's wet dream--
buy low, sell high.

00:25:45,172 --> 00:25:46,940
So they played it smart.

00:25:47,007 --> 00:25:48,275
Well, one of them did.

00:25:48,342 --> 00:25:49,576
From all I can tell

00:25:49,643 --> 00:25:52,012
Jerry Walden was selling to
Adventures from the get-go

00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:54,314
but his partner was a different
deal altogether.

00:25:54,381 --> 00:25:56,383
He was a diehard
environmentalist.

00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,618
A real tree-hugger.

00:25:57,684 --> 00:25:59,953
You can say that again.

00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,288
He saw the writing on the wall.

00:26:01,355 --> 00:26:02,556
The urbanization of Lake Mead

00:26:02,623 --> 00:26:04,725
and he spent every cent he had
trying to fight it.

00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:07,227
When it comes down
to money versus the
environment

00:26:07,294 --> 00:26:09,263
it's no big surprise
who's going to win.

00:26:09,329 --> 00:26:11,932
So is there anything else
that I can do for you?

00:26:12,966 --> 00:26:14,668
I'll see you.

00:26:18,305 --> 00:26:19,740
This really frosts
my lizard.

00:26:19,807 --> 00:26:22,443
I go out to the lake
to get away from
the casinos.

00:26:22,509 --> 00:26:23,977
Well, there goes
jet-skiing.

00:26:24,044 --> 00:26:26,413
What about the land deed,
Ronnie?

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,982
Oh, what I can
tell you about that is...

00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:30,117
I'm impressed.

00:26:30,184 --> 00:26:32,886
If it is a forgery,
it's a great forgery.

00:26:32,953 --> 00:26:33,887
Van Gogh.

00:26:33,954 --> 00:26:35,489
Nothing I can testify to.

00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,093
What can you testify to?

00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:41,662
Have you seen my VSC-4 machine?

00:26:41,729 --> 00:26:42,996
No.

00:26:50,104 --> 00:26:52,606
The original copy
of the land sale
agreement, okay?

00:26:52,673 --> 00:26:55,008
Inks luminesce

00:26:55,075 --> 00:26:59,146
at different
wavelengths.

00:26:59,213 --> 00:27:01,448
At one wavelength

00:27:01,515 --> 00:27:03,584
the signature
on the left
disappears.

00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:04,718
At another wavelength

00:27:04,785 --> 00:27:06,420
the one on the right
disappears.

00:27:06,487 --> 00:27:07,554
Where'd it go?

00:27:07,621 --> 00:27:09,289
I can bring it back.

00:27:11,058 --> 00:27:13,127
What does it mean?

00:27:13,193 --> 00:27:14,928
Whatever you make of it.

00:27:14,995 --> 00:27:16,997
You've got
a legal document.

00:27:17,064 --> 00:27:18,999
Two signatures--

00:27:19,066 --> 00:27:21,368
notarized, the whole
nine yards.

00:27:21,435 --> 00:27:23,504
The only thing
I can tell you

00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:26,407
is your two guys
used separate pens.

00:27:29,576 --> 00:27:32,012
Excuse me.

00:27:33,514 --> 00:27:34,648
Yeah.

00:27:34,715 --> 00:27:38,652
Silphid beetle--
test for presence of human DNA.

00:27:42,322 --> 00:27:44,391
Is this definitive?

00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:46,360
Yes, sir.

00:27:52,466 --> 00:27:54,001
Did we get our warrant?

00:27:54,068 --> 00:27:55,502
The beetle was full
of human DNA.

00:27:55,569 --> 00:27:56,603
Brass got us a judge.

00:28:03,077 --> 00:28:05,679
Let's go knock down some walls.

00:28:22,496 --> 00:28:24,598
( <i>coughing</i> )

00:28:24,665 --> 00:28:27,301
One wall down...

00:28:27,367 --> 00:28:28,736
15 to go.

00:28:28,802 --> 00:28:30,738
Sorry to interrupt your fun

00:28:30,804 --> 00:28:34,141
but I have someone here
you might like to meet.

00:28:35,642 --> 00:28:37,611
Jimmy Durante's
girlfriend.

00:28:40,013 --> 00:28:41,582
You're Alison Scott?

00:28:41,648 --> 00:28:44,351
I see Cliff's been
showing off again.

00:28:44,418 --> 00:28:46,920
It's one of
the reasons I left him.

00:28:46,987 --> 00:28:48,422
You left him?

00:28:48,489 --> 00:28:51,058
I went back to my old
boyfriend in Chicago.

00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:54,161
Miss Scott, we found

00:28:54,228 --> 00:28:56,597
some blood on one of Cliff's lamps.

00:28:56,663 --> 00:28:58,365
Stubbed my toe on that lamp

00:28:58,432 --> 00:28:59,466
like once a week.

00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:01,935
I begged Cliff
not to buy that thing

00:29:02,002 --> 00:29:03,771
but he never listens.

00:29:03,837 --> 00:29:05,639
GRISSOM:
Would you be amenable

00:29:05,706 --> 00:29:07,741
to providing us with
a sample of your blood

00:29:07,808 --> 00:29:08,976
for comparison purposes?

00:29:09,042 --> 00:29:10,677
Sure.

00:29:10,744 --> 00:29:13,547
But I'm telling you,
that's my blood.

00:29:13,614 --> 00:29:14,548
Look, Cliff's...

00:29:14,615 --> 00:29:15,983
well, he's a lot of things

00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:18,152
but he's not a murderer.

00:29:18,218 --> 00:29:20,387
Yeah, I still want a sample.

00:29:20,454 --> 00:29:21,955
Warrick, would you?

00:29:22,022 --> 00:29:23,791
Yeah.

00:29:37,671 --> 00:29:39,073
You never get
a second chance

00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:40,808
to make a first
impression.

00:29:40,874 --> 00:29:42,810
A square of nine dots on paper

00:29:42,876 --> 00:29:45,946
and you can only draw four lines
to connect them

00:29:46,013 --> 00:29:50,284
without the pen
ever leaving the paper.

00:29:53,787 --> 00:29:55,456
Right.

00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:00,160
Think outside the box.

00:30:09,336 --> 00:30:11,271
( <i>doorbell ringing</i> )

00:30:22,249 --> 00:30:25,285
Yeah. What do
you want now?

00:30:25,352 --> 00:30:28,922
We need to
take a look at your wall.

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,988
Hey, yo, Cat...

00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:48,829
I'm going to forget
that you called me that.

00:30:48,895 --> 00:30:51,998
Sorry.
Um, I've got a full profile on our--

00:30:52,065 --> 00:30:54,034
a full profile
on our--

00:30:54,101 --> 00:30:55,335
"your" torch.

00:30:55,402 --> 00:30:57,471
I pulled his DNA off
of a cigarette butt.

00:30:57,537 --> 00:30:59,973
Lucky for us, he's
a wet-lipped smoker.

00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,008
So, you've done your job.

00:31:02,075 --> 00:31:03,677
I got to go do mine.

00:31:03,744 --> 00:31:05,378
Just give me something
we can compare it to.

00:31:06,813 --> 00:31:08,782
These ash wood splinters
are from scuba guy's back?

00:31:08,849 --> 00:31:09,816
Mm-hmm.

00:31:09,883 --> 00:31:12,185
Embedded in his aconeus muscle.

00:31:12,252 --> 00:31:15,422
After you paged me
I had Robbins comb his body.

00:31:15,489 --> 00:31:17,257
They only get
us something

00:31:17,324 --> 00:31:20,227
if they match Walden's
Ninja coffee table.

00:31:23,095 --> 00:31:24,863
It's your theory.

00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,902
WILLOWS:
Radial chains align.

00:31:30,969 --> 00:31:32,170
Pores match.

00:31:32,237 --> 00:31:34,506
Two pieces of ash wood,
one source.

00:31:34,573 --> 00:31:37,409
So, Walden and Skeller
get into an argument

00:31:37,476 --> 00:31:39,144
probably over their land.

00:31:39,211 --> 00:31:41,380
Buy yourself a hundred acres
of rain forest, man!

00:31:41,446 --> 00:31:42,481
Cash in your end!

00:31:42,547 --> 00:31:43,548
I'm not going to sell!

00:31:43,615 --> 00:31:44,950
Walden pushes Skeller

00:31:45,017 --> 00:31:47,319
he falls back
onto the ash wood table.

00:31:47,386 --> 00:31:49,021
But that's not
what killed Skeller.

00:31:49,087 --> 00:31:51,390
Robbins said he took
a line drive to the chest.

00:31:51,456 --> 00:31:53,191
Which escalates to a punch.

00:31:56,061 --> 00:31:58,296
I'll call O'Reilly.

00:31:58,363 --> 00:31:59,865
Scented candles, huh?

00:31:59,931 --> 00:32:03,802
EVANS:
Food went rotten
wanted to cover the smell.

00:32:03,869 --> 00:32:07,012
You've re-plastered
this wall recently?

00:32:07,078 --> 00:32:08,013
I had rain damage.

00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:10,015
Funneled down,
wrecked a five-foot area.

00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:20,715
You wouldn't mind if I, uh...

00:32:20,782 --> 00:32:23,418
examined your vent, would you?

00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:25,186
( <i>door opens</i> )

00:32:25,253 --> 00:32:27,489
BRASS:
You don't have to ask
his permission.

00:32:27,555 --> 00:32:29,758
I got a new warrant
that covers his apartment.

00:32:29,824 --> 00:32:32,227
Your wife being
missing put it over.

00:32:32,294 --> 00:32:34,829
Funny you didn't
mention that before.

00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:44,914
Did you know that your apartment

00:32:44,981 --> 00:32:47,750
shares heating ducts
with the apartment next door?

00:32:47,817 --> 00:32:50,286
Yeah, me and Cliff were always
fighting about the temperature.

00:32:50,353 --> 00:32:51,354
So what?

00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:05,735
Sara?

00:33:05,802 --> 00:33:06,803
Yeah.

00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:23,720
Hold up. Hold up.
Hold up.

00:33:33,396 --> 00:33:34,898
Alklyd.

00:33:34,964 --> 00:33:37,066
Blood on
the blanket.

00:33:39,035 --> 00:33:42,205
And <i>Dermestidae Masculatus.</i>

00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:43,806
SARA:
That's Latin

00:33:43,873 --> 00:33:45,642
for you're hiding
a dead body.

00:33:45,708 --> 00:33:46,943
BRASS:
What's the matter?

00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:49,078
Didn't realize
how bad a corpse can smell

00:33:49,145 --> 00:33:51,345
so you just decided to move it
around the place?

00:33:51,514 --> 00:33:53,095
GRISSOM:
You can tell us where the body is

00:33:53,095 --> 00:33:55,752
or we can, uh...

00:33:55,819 --> 00:33:59,122
tear your place apart
piece by piece.

00:33:59,189 --> 00:34:01,491
Whichever.

00:34:01,558 --> 00:34:03,059
Look, you got squat.

00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:06,396
Jerry and Bruce signed
with different pens.

00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:09,432
You found a cigarette butt
at Lake Mead

00:34:09,499 --> 00:34:11,401
and wood chips
on a tree-hugger.

00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,803
Bottom line, you got
a dead guy up a tree

00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,005
and you don't know
how he got there.

00:34:16,072 --> 00:34:18,074
Hey, I'm just here
to make the arrest.

00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:19,142
For what? What have you got?

00:34:19,209 --> 00:34:20,310
Plenty.

00:34:20,376 --> 00:34:22,812
Why don't we
just start from the beginning.

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,115
Bruce Skeller
didn't die in any fire.

00:34:26,182 --> 00:34:27,350
He was killed

00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:29,385
at your house.

00:34:30,687 --> 00:34:34,090
He didn't pick up any ash
splinters from that forest.

00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:36,259
It's all telarosa and oak
out there.

00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:38,361
STOKES:
You had a dead body.

00:34:38,428 --> 00:34:41,431
So, you decided to get creative.

00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:44,167
Fire season, wet suit

00:34:44,234 --> 00:34:45,969
liquid soap.

00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:51,541
You drove out to the lake,
dumped the body...

00:34:56,212 --> 00:34:57,647
...and lit up.

00:34:59,883 --> 00:35:02,252
Not 'cause
you wanted a cigarette.

00:35:02,318 --> 00:35:04,254
You lit up with a purpose.

00:35:07,257 --> 00:35:09,492
This gave you a head start.

00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:11,861
My guess is around, what,
five-minute mark.

00:35:15,698 --> 00:35:19,502
You figured the fire department
would label it a hot spot--

00:35:19,569 --> 00:35:21,571
relate it to the original fire

00:35:21,638 --> 00:35:23,706
and the body would just burn up.

00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:25,909
Still doesn't explain
how Bruce's body

00:35:25,975 --> 00:35:27,243
wound up in that tree.

00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,678
I didn't put him there.

00:35:29,779 --> 00:35:30,880
Actually...

00:35:32,315 --> 00:35:34,217
you did.

00:35:34,284 --> 00:35:36,319
See, the thing you forgot

00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:40,056
about a scuba tank is
it contains compressed air.

00:35:40,123 --> 00:35:42,592
Too much heat... and

00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:44,294
kaboom.

00:36:01,845 --> 00:36:04,781
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:36:04,848 --> 00:36:06,249
Rocket man.

00:36:06,316 --> 00:36:07,350
Yeah.

00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:09,118
Got to love this job.

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,936
I got a hollow section.

00:36:30,507 --> 00:36:32,442
Let's open it up.

00:36:50,927 --> 00:36:52,529
Damn.

00:36:52,595 --> 00:36:57,267
Are we in the wrong
apartment again?

00:36:57,333 --> 00:36:59,035
I don't know.

00:36:59,102 --> 00:37:01,070
I don't mind being wrong.

00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:03,773
I just don't think
I am this time.

00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,544
Okay... start on
the floorboards.

00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,546
I'll be outside.

00:37:26,596 --> 00:37:28,131
You okay?

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,866
95.

00:37:29,933 --> 00:37:31,434
Excuse me?

00:37:33,054 --> 00:37:34,470
Normally my pulse is 70.

00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,472
When it gets to 95
I realize how mad I am.

00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:39,409
I have ten people working
around the clock on this thing.

00:37:39,476 --> 00:37:40,844
You're too hard
on yourself.

00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,011
No, no,
I'm not mad at me.

00:37:42,078 --> 00:37:44,614
There's a body in there
and that guy knows where it is!

00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:47,150
What's your pulse at now?

00:37:47,217 --> 00:37:49,152
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:37:51,888 --> 00:37:55,191
You want to take a walk
around the block?

00:37:55,258 --> 00:37:56,326
Get some air?

00:37:56,392 --> 00:37:58,661
No.

00:37:58,728 --> 00:37:59,963
Clear your head.

00:38:02,432 --> 00:38:04,667
I'm fine.

00:38:04,734 --> 00:38:06,469
Okay.

00:38:13,343 --> 00:38:15,512
Chalk, from plaster.

00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:18,314
Oh.

00:38:20,817 --> 00:38:23,686
Better go wash up.

00:38:57,353 --> 00:38:59,255
Hey, Brass.

00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:03,526
When did the shnoz say
he lost his hot water?

00:39:03,593 --> 00:39:05,595
He wasn't exact.

00:39:05,662 --> 00:39:08,798
You, uh, have no pressure
for your hot water.

00:39:08,865 --> 00:39:11,568
I got a plumber coming
on Saturday.

00:39:11,634 --> 00:39:13,803
Well, you know, my Uncle Herb
was a plumber.

00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,071
I might be able to help.

00:39:15,138 --> 00:39:16,472
Where's your installation?

00:39:16,539 --> 00:39:17,740
In the basement.

00:39:17,807 --> 00:39:19,642
But, really,
I got a plumber coming.

00:39:28,384 --> 00:39:30,987
You got an electrician coming,
too?

00:39:35,261 --> 00:39:37,160
A filtration system.

00:39:37,227 --> 00:39:38,294
It softens the water.

00:39:38,361 --> 00:39:39,295
Yeah.

00:39:39,362 --> 00:39:41,297
Listen, you know, I
got a guy on retainer.

00:39:41,364 --> 00:39:42,499
You don't have
to do this.

00:39:42,565 --> 00:39:43,800
Yeah, well, I'm non-union.

00:39:44,762 --> 00:39:46,603
There's no disruption
to the cold water line.

00:39:46,669 --> 00:39:48,938
Hot water line...

00:39:49,005 --> 00:39:51,774
water runs through
the filtration tanks first

00:39:51,841 --> 00:39:54,277
and the water heater second,
right?

00:39:54,344 --> 00:39:55,745
Yeah.

00:39:57,678 --> 00:40:00,216
Why is it bypassed?

00:40:04,053 --> 00:40:07,924
You've cut off the water
to the filtration tanks.

00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:11,327
Something's wrong with that.
I had no choice.

00:40:15,899 --> 00:40:19,135
( <i>knocks</i> )

00:40:20,179 --> 00:40:23,511
Brine tanks are usually hollow.
Only got about eight inches of water at the bottom

00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,707
for the salt mixture.

00:40:26,242 --> 00:40:30,113
( <i>knocks on tank again</i> )

00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,081
Does that sound hollow to you?

00:40:40,523 --> 00:40:42,091
Oh...

00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:47,697
Not enough candles in the world.

00:40:50,834 --> 00:40:52,869
She nagged me.

00:40:59,909 --> 00:41:02,712
She nagged you?

00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:11,921
Hey, you want to grab
some breakfast?

00:41:11,988 --> 00:41:13,089
No, thanks.

00:41:13,156 --> 00:41:15,525
STOKES:
Come on...
we always get better service

00:41:15,592 --> 00:41:16,593
when you're there.

00:41:16,659 --> 00:41:18,561
I'm having breakfast
with a friend of mine.

00:41:18,628 --> 00:41:21,898
STOKES:
You're keeping him alive?

00:41:21,965 --> 00:41:24,901
Sara said you guys
already solved the case.

00:41:24,968 --> 00:41:26,469
He did.

00:41:28,771 --> 00:41:30,428
All right.
