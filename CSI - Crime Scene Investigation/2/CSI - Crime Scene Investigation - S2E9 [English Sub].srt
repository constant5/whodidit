00:00:08,338 --> 00:00:09,817
Five! Baby, go!

00:00:09,817 --> 00:00:11,343
Seven. Whoo!

00:00:28,978 --> 00:00:30,847
Changing $100.

00:00:30,847 --> 00:00:32,682
Change $100, go ahead.

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,356
(<i>boisterous shouting)</i>

00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,662
Section G-3, all clear.

00:00:46,662 --> 00:00:48,358
En route to H-4

00:00:48,358 --> 00:00:49,899
then Soft Count.

00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,985
(<i>all screaming)</i>

00:01:17,356 --> 00:01:18,361
Section G-4.

00:01:18,361 --> 00:01:20,997
Security Three
intersect at G-5.

00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,832
Contain! Contain!

00:01:34,277 --> 00:01:35,811
GRISSOM:
And the body count?

00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:37,880
Five guards,
three civilians wounded.

00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,915
One dead bad guy.

00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:40,950
Armed robbers snatched
the lock boxes

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,363
from the two
high-stakes tables

00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:44,220
right off the rolling cage.

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,361
Cash on wheels.

00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:47,023
Busiest time of night.

00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,355
Three women-- organized
and muscled.

00:01:49,355 --> 00:01:50,893
Small time crooks, Jim.

00:01:50,893 --> 00:01:53,355
Hey, they got away
with 250 K.

00:01:53,355 --> 00:01:55,264
That's a mere pittance

00:01:55,264 --> 00:01:56,358
to a Vegas casino.

00:01:56,358 --> 00:01:59,902
Cashiers alone are sitting
on a million and change.

00:01:59,902 --> 00:02:01,070
Small time or not

00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,105
these ladies are dangerous.

00:02:06,008 --> 00:02:08,363
Dangerous, yes.

00:02:08,363 --> 00:02:10,246
Ladies...

00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:13,983
no.

00:02:29,932 --> 00:02:32,363

00:02:32,363 --> 00:02:34,737

00:02:58,363 --> 00:03:00,358
WARRICK:
These guys packed enough

00:03:00,358 --> 00:03:02,932
.45 caliber ammo
for a small army.

00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,768
Security managed
to return a few rounds.

00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:06,936
Nine millimeter.

00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,354
Less than a year ago

00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,363
security couldn't
even carry guns.

00:03:10,363 --> 00:03:12,008
Times have changed.

00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:13,362
Yeah.

00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:16,112
The same M.O.
as Laughlin.

00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,881
Last month, Cottage Casino,
men dressed as women

00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:20,216
shot the place to hell.

00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:21,363
In and out in
under five.

00:03:21,363 --> 00:03:23,953
My bet was that that was
the practice run.

00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,254
And the more
you practice...

00:03:25,254 --> 00:03:27,990
MAN:
I don't know what
the hell's going on
with the world.

00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,058
Everything's crazy.

00:03:29,058 --> 00:03:30,793
I risk my life
just coming into work.

00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,354
Makes you miss
the mob days, huh?

00:03:32,354 --> 00:03:34,354
Back then, this never
would've happened.

00:03:34,354 --> 00:03:36,732
And if it did, those scumbags,
they'd be dead,

00:03:36,732 --> 00:03:37,933
every last one of them

00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:40,002
and we would never
know about it.

00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:41,771
Mister...
Mr. Duncan--

00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:43,355
take a deep breath

00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:44,974
and tell us
what happened.

00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,742
We'd just made
a money transfer

00:03:46,742 --> 00:03:48,010
to the rolling cages.

00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,211
Then, bang--

00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:51,881
the chandelier comes
crashing down.

00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:53,362
Sounded like an explosion.

00:03:53,362 --> 00:03:56,118
So I dropped to my knees--
took cover.

00:03:56,118 --> 00:03:57,355
Anything else?

00:03:57,355 --> 00:04:00,122
Yeah, I started praying
for the gunfire to stop.

00:04:00,122 --> 00:04:01,857
Okay. Thanks a lot.

00:04:01,857 --> 00:04:05,061
And check in with triage
before you leave.

00:04:06,095 --> 00:04:08,164
Well, that was
helpful.

00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:11,362
Actually, it was.

00:04:11,362 --> 00:04:14,103
Gives us
a starting point.

00:04:14,103 --> 00:04:16,360
<i>The falling chandelier</i>
<i>distracts the guards.</i>

00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,840
<i>Makes them easy targets.</i>

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,357
(<i>gunshots)</i>

00:04:19,357 --> 00:04:22,978
The armed robbers load up,
head for the exits...

00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:24,280
Quick escape.

00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,361
Chaos moving
in one direction

00:04:26,361 --> 00:04:29,018
the money moving
in the other.

00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,357
Can you imagine living out here?

00:04:38,357 --> 00:04:39,829
It's peaceful.

00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:41,163
Peaceful?

00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:43,833
The town just lost five percent
of its population.

00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:47,870
I thought you said
this was a single homicide.

00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,306
Yeah, in a population of 20.

00:04:52,174 --> 00:04:53,360
SIDLE:
We made it.

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,910
State trooper.

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,860
Two hours to drive
75 miles.

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,095
You guys got lost.

00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:14,797
What's the rush?

00:05:14,797 --> 00:05:17,032
Crime scene's
not going anywhere.

00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:18,167
Yeah, but I am.

00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:20,202
Body's behind the counter.

00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:21,804
Dustin Bale--

00:05:21,804 --> 00:05:23,072
store clerk.

00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,361
Bullet through
the chest.

00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:25,941
The register's empty.

00:05:25,941 --> 00:05:28,362
"Officer Spencer..."
did you touch anything?

00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:29,879
14 years as a state trooper.

00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,356
I know how to secure
a crime scene

00:05:31,356 --> 00:05:32,982
without contaminating
the evidence.

00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:34,950
Sorry.

00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,361
It's okay.

00:05:36,361 --> 00:05:38,360
Look, I cover
97.5 square miles.

00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,655
I got to book.

00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,845
Vomit?

00:06:08,184 --> 00:06:10,219
Not an expectorate.

00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:11,754
Potato.

00:06:11,754 --> 00:06:12,922
Blown to smithereens.

00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:15,724
A poor man's silencer.

00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:23,732
Now, why would an assailant
need a silencer way out here?

00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,052
Last paying customer--

00:06:43,052 --> 00:06:45,355
eight hours ago.

00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:47,156
We just got the call.

00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,357
The place is open 24/seven.

00:06:49,357 --> 00:06:51,894
Why'd it take
so long?

00:06:51,894 --> 00:06:54,997
SIDLE:
<i>The assailant flipped the sign</i>
<i>on the way out</i>

00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,361
buying him time to get away.

00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:00,836
WILLOWS:
But now without

00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:03,272
 getting his picture taken first.

00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:18,354
It's plastic.

00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,362
You're joking.

00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:24,059
Nine volt attached
to a blinking light.

00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:29,231
Real or fake, it didn't work.

00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:31,133
MAN:
There was three of them.

00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:32,835
They come from around
the corner, guns drawn

00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:38,140
I think they came
from over there.

00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,708
There were two of them.

00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,356
WOMAN:
<i>I said four.</i>

00:07:42,356 --> 00:07:44,013
There were four
of those lunatics.

00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:45,047
They were everywhere.

00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,148
Right.

00:07:46,148 --> 00:07:47,149
Write it down.

00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:48,363
I got it.
Thank you very much.

00:07:48,363 --> 00:07:49,363
Excuse me.

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,955
I've interviewed
17 people.

00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:54,657
No two accounts
are alike.

00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:56,692
A Harvard professor
conducted an experiment.

00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:58,794
Asked a bunch of students
to watch a basketball game--

00:07:58,794 --> 00:08:00,362
count the number of times
the ball was passed.

00:08:00,362 --> 00:08:02,231
Yeah. Groundbreaking.

00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,356
During the game

00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:04,967
a person dressed in
a gorilla suit

00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:06,001
ran across the court.

00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:07,670
Afterwards, the professor

00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,773
asked his students
if they noticed
the gorilla.

00:08:10,773 --> 00:08:12,708
50% responded,
"What gorilla?"

00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:13,742
That's wonderful, Gil.

00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:15,357
If I see a gorilla,
I'll arrest it.

00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:20,115
The car was sitting
right here.

00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:21,984
Did you get
a good look at it?

00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:23,361
Make, model?

00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:25,821
No. It was beige,
beat up.

00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:27,089
Hazards flashing.

00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,291
People leave their cars here
all the time.

00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,293
I wait ten minutes
then call for a tow.

00:08:31,293 --> 00:08:33,355
Car peel out?

00:08:33,355 --> 00:08:35,359
No. The driver gunned it
but I didn't hear a screech.

00:08:45,355 --> 00:08:47,910
Smells like burnt wood.

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,363
Motor oil?

00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:52,359
No. No, transmission fluid.

00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:55,084
But it's brown, not red.

00:08:55,084 --> 00:08:56,355
Which means?

00:08:56,355 --> 00:08:59,221
It's not the right color.

00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:06,762
Extraction is
an art, Albert.

00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:09,031
I like to think so.

00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:11,360
So this is our cross-dresser
in the blue coat?

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,968
I.D.'d as Adam Brower.

00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:14,903
Shot in the back
with a hollow point--

00:09:14,903 --> 00:09:16,305
close range.

00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,358
Mushroomed upon impact

00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,360
maximizing trauma.

00:09:23,112 --> 00:09:24,913
Caliber?

00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:27,049
Forty-five.

00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:29,363
The guards were armed
with nine millimeters

00:09:29,363 --> 00:09:31,820
and they weren't
hollow point.

00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,355
so...

00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:34,857
he was shot
in the back

00:09:34,857 --> 00:09:36,692
by one of his
own partners?

00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:38,354
Someone didn't
want to share.

00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:47,803
Wow. A fumette.

00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:49,772
Did you get that
out of some museum?

00:09:49,772 --> 00:09:50,873
Hey, don't
knock it.

00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:52,174
It's still the best tool

00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,360
for lifting prints
off cardboard.

00:09:55,744 --> 00:09:57,358
Blow and print.

00:09:57,358 --> 00:09:59,715
If you were in a hurry

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,357
how would you get back there?

00:10:03,357 --> 00:10:06,362
Easy.

00:10:06,362 --> 00:10:07,956
Jump the counter.

00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:10,356
Exactly what
I'm thinking.

00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,756
(<i>electrostatic crackling)</i>

00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:51,355
Shoe prints.

00:10:51,355 --> 00:10:53,202
Lay it out.

00:10:53,202 --> 00:10:55,363
Suspect entered...

00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:00,275
<i>shoots the clerk</i>
<i>through the potato...</i>

00:11:02,077 --> 00:11:05,180
<i>then hops up and over,</i>
<i>leaving behind shoe prints...</i>

00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,216
<i>grabs the cash...</i>

00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:10,252
<i>flips the sign from</i>
<i>"open" to "closed" and exits.</i>

00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,788
How old is the killer?

00:11:12,788 --> 00:11:14,656
What are you thinking?

00:11:14,656 --> 00:11:17,659
Shoe size is
five, six tops.

00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:20,996
We may be looking
for a minor.

00:11:20,996 --> 00:11:22,358
You want to see me?

00:11:22,358 --> 00:11:23,363
Yeah.

00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:26,768
This is the video surveillance
from the heist.

00:11:26,768 --> 00:11:30,139
This camera was trained
on their entrance.

00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:31,840
All the disguises
in the world

00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,356
and they dress like women.

00:11:33,356 --> 00:11:36,178
Ski masks are played out.

00:11:36,178 --> 00:11:39,681
Red and Blue teamed up together

00:11:39,681 --> 00:11:41,917
and took out the guards
in the rolling cage.

00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:43,361
Black shot down
that chandelier.

00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:45,363
Well, Blue's the decedent

00:11:45,363 --> 00:11:47,923
I.D.'d as Adam Brower...

00:11:47,923 --> 00:11:49,363
so enlarge Red.

00:11:51,356 --> 00:11:53,162
No amount of makeup
in the world

00:11:53,162 --> 00:11:55,358
could cover up that chunk
of Adam's apple.

00:11:55,358 --> 00:11:58,358
That must be the one
that killed Brower.

00:11:58,358 --> 00:12:00,869
.45 in the back at close range.

00:12:03,205 --> 00:12:06,141
No honor among thieves.

00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:08,210
Photoshop Black.

00:12:10,846 --> 00:12:12,748
No stubble...

00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:14,783
no Adam's apple.

00:12:14,783 --> 00:12:16,318
Dressed
as a woman

00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,361
among men dressed as women.

00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:22,791
Now, see?
That's a disguise.

00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,363
Fluorescent powders?

00:12:33,363 --> 00:12:36,038
Eh, why not?
They're in the kit.

00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:38,040
Protocol's black.

00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,876
Since when do you care
about my choice of powders?

00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:43,359
Assistant coroner
is four hours late

00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:46,354
and we are stuck out here
until he transports the body.

00:12:46,354 --> 00:12:48,817
And I haven't even heard
from Grissom.

00:12:48,817 --> 00:12:50,786
I've never tried green.
I should never
have been sent

00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:52,788
to this remote scene
in the first place.

00:12:52,788 --> 00:12:54,022
I've got seniority.
I deserve--

00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:57,192
no, I've<i>earnedthe</i>
right to pick my cases.

00:13:06,361 --> 00:13:08,363
If I start eating,
I will shut up.

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,774
Do you have a mirror?

00:13:12,774 --> 00:13:15,110
Since when do you care
about your appearance?

00:13:18,947 --> 00:13:20,983
I mean at a crime scene.

00:13:20,983 --> 00:13:23,118
It's not for me.

00:13:23,118 --> 00:13:24,354
Sorry.

00:13:27,656 --> 00:13:29,157
We can't touch it.

00:13:29,157 --> 00:13:30,926
I'm just getting a better look.

00:13:39,801 --> 00:13:41,360
Oh, thank God.
It's about time.

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,072
Nice to see you,
too, Catherine.

00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:45,807
Well, I smell the body.

00:13:45,807 --> 00:13:47,109
Where is he?
Hey, David.

00:13:47,109 --> 00:13:48,354
I wasn't touching him.

00:13:48,354 --> 00:13:50,112
I know you better than that.

00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:51,880
So, uh, what took you
so long?

00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,357
I made a wrong turn
back at the fork.

00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:06,795
You're a surfer now?

00:14:06,795 --> 00:14:08,096
Dude, I rip.

00:14:08,096 --> 00:14:12,067
We're 300 miles from
the nearest beach.

00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:15,003
Surfing's just
a state of mind.

00:14:15,003 --> 00:14:16,360
I got your page.

00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,363
Where's my report?

00:14:17,363 --> 00:14:18,363
Oh, relax, bro.

00:14:18,363 --> 00:14:20,356
The GC Mass Spec's
working on it.

00:14:20,356 --> 00:14:21,360
Should be done, um...

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,355
(<i>spectrometer beeps)</i>

00:14:23,355 --> 00:14:24,980
now.

00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:27,355
Transmission fluid.

00:14:27,355 --> 00:14:30,886
Yeah, thanks.

00:14:30,886 --> 00:14:34,056
Type F with Dexron.

00:14:34,056 --> 00:14:36,058
So...

00:14:36,058 --> 00:14:37,959
you should be reading
<i>Car &amp; Driver</i>

00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:39,356
instead of<i>Sand</i>
<i>and Surf.</i>

00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:41,362
Someone put the wrong type
of fluid

00:14:41,362 --> 00:14:43,354
in the car's transmission.

00:14:43,354 --> 00:14:45,233
See, Ford automobiles use

00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:47,703
a thick, red, Type F
transmission fluid.

00:14:47,703 --> 00:14:50,172
General Motors uses
a thinner, yellow fluid

00:14:50,172 --> 00:14:51,173
with Dexron.

00:14:51,173 --> 00:14:53,108
Now, when Dexron's
put into a Ford

00:14:53,108 --> 00:14:54,363
it thins that Type F fluid.

00:14:54,363 --> 00:14:56,355
Friction builds, gears grind.

00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:59,114
<i>The second gear</i>
<i>is usually the first to go.</i>

00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:01,363
<i>Friction causes the engine</i>
<i>to overheat, in turn</i>

00:15:01,363 --> 00:15:03,085
<i>cooking the transmission fluid</i>

00:15:03,085 --> 00:15:04,152
turning it brown.

00:15:04,152 --> 00:15:06,358
Leak on the pavement
is the first clue

00:15:06,358 --> 00:15:07,823
you've got a problem.

00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,926
Congratulations--
you're looking for
a Ford with a leak.

00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:12,027
Not just a Ford.

00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:15,130
The getaway vehicle
has a stubborn second gear.

00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,358
Which means
it can't get very far.

00:15:17,358 --> 00:15:19,361
My guess is
it's already been dumped.

00:15:19,361 --> 00:15:22,355
Before Mr. Brower
dressed up as a woman

00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,839
and heisted a casino

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,242
he was a janitor
at an office park
off Flamingo.

00:15:27,242 --> 00:15:30,078
Before that,
he was "out of town."

00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:32,357
Fours years,
grand larceny.

00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:36,752
Well, the manager's not in?

00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:38,787
I got a warrant.

00:15:38,787 --> 00:15:39,988
I got a key.

00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:49,931
Whoo, tidy little camper,
isn't he?

00:15:49,931 --> 00:15:52,359
BROWN:
Yeah.

00:15:59,207 --> 00:16:00,358
What are we looking for?

00:16:00,358 --> 00:16:01,910
Anything that links
Brower

00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,359
to his co-conspirators.

00:16:14,356 --> 00:16:15,924
Dirty laundry?

00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:18,126
I'm thinking trace elements
in the clothes

00:16:18,126 --> 00:16:20,358
could tell us where he was
before the heist.

00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:24,833
I'm going to take it all
back to the lab.

00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,835
Okay.

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,772
Let's see here...

00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:47,889
Well, while you're at it

00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:49,958
don't forget his wigs and bras.

00:17:17,354 --> 00:17:19,120
Anything on
the shoe print?

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,022
Skechers.
Adult size five.

00:17:21,022 --> 00:17:22,360
Female.

00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,025
Well, at least we're
not chasing a kid.

00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:26,061
How's the prints
coming?

00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:27,796
WOMAN:
You two lifted
82 suspect prints.

00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,698
43 are partial.

00:17:29,698 --> 00:17:31,233
WILLOWS:
We ID'd one

00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:32,355
from the "open/closed"
sign.

00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:33,869
Great.
Not so great.

00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:35,356
State trooper.

00:17:35,356 --> 00:17:36,738
You got to be kidding me.

00:17:36,738 --> 00:17:38,773
"Officer Moron"
contaminated the scene.

00:17:38,773 --> 00:17:42,077
Yep. Well, I'll just
beef him to his captain.

00:17:42,077 --> 00:17:44,360
Tough. I like that.

00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,363
(<i>beeping)</i>

00:17:45,363 --> 00:17:47,148
Match.

00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:48,950
Print off
the register.

00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:49,684
What have you got?

00:17:53,255 --> 00:17:55,090
Tammy Felton.

00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,363
Who's Tammy Felton?

00:17:56,363 --> 00:17:59,363
A fugitive and
clinical psychopath

00:17:59,363 --> 00:18:02,030
that Grissom and I
put behind bars.

00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,900
She tried to play me
but I didn't bite.

00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:12,362
Her biological parents
posted bail

00:18:12,362 --> 00:18:14,359
and then she bailed on them.

00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,877
Biological parents?

00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:18,358
Tammy was kidnapped
as a child.

00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:20,081
Raised by her kidnapper.

00:18:20,081 --> 00:18:23,018
When she found out
the truth, she killed him.

00:18:27,656 --> 00:18:29,257
Hey, finish running the prints.

00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:32,294
Tammy uses people.

00:18:32,294 --> 00:18:33,662
She wasn't alone.

00:18:34,963 --> 00:18:36,264
Grissom!

00:18:36,264 --> 00:18:37,866
If you're going to badger me

00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,669
about your crime scene location,
put it in a memo.

00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:42,103
You don't
read memos.

00:18:42,103 --> 00:18:43,838
Do you remember
Tammy Felton?

00:18:43,838 --> 00:18:45,674
I always remember
the ones that get away.

00:18:45,674 --> 00:18:46,908
She's back.

00:18:47,976 --> 00:18:49,878
She's been
to Cal Nev Ari.

00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,681
She's a prime suspect
in our convenience
store homicide.

00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:55,183
Grissom...
I need you, ASAP.

00:18:55,183 --> 00:18:57,185
Please.

00:19:00,956 --> 00:19:04,357
So, Ballistics sent me
a bullet from the casino.

00:19:04,357 --> 00:19:05,994
It's a .45, so we know

00:19:05,994 --> 00:19:08,354
it came from one
of the "ladies'" guns.

00:19:08,354 --> 00:19:10,765
And this is
a special bullet?

00:19:10,765 --> 00:19:13,168
No, but there was
a foreign substance
adhered to it.

00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:14,362
And the substance
is special?

00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,359
Not exactly.

00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:18,006
Just get to the point, Greg.

00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:20,358
Tomato, to-mah-to,
potato...

00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:21,776
Wait a second.

00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:23,845
There was potato
on the bullet?

00:19:23,845 --> 00:19:25,880
SANDERS:
You bet.

00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,048
Strange, huh?

00:19:27,048 --> 00:19:28,283
There was potato
on the bullet

00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:29,362
because there
was potato

00:19:29,362 --> 00:19:31,286
inside the barrel
of the gun.

00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:33,355
This bullet
is from<i>myinvestigation.</i>

00:19:33,355 --> 00:19:34,357
Right.

00:19:34,357 --> 00:19:36,359
One of your armed robbers

00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,356
may have used a potato
as a silencer

00:19:39,356 --> 00:19:41,062
 prior to the heist.

00:19:45,354 --> 00:19:47,002
Tammy Felton?

00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:48,937
Maybe.

00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,362
Three armed robbers.

00:19:51,362 --> 00:19:54,357
Adam Brower--
killed at the scene

00:19:54,357 --> 00:19:55,777
Tammy Felton...

00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,359
We're still
one suspect short.

00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,781
SIDLE:
Cath, got another match

00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,282
from the convenience store.

00:20:01,282 --> 00:20:02,951
The print
on the outside doorknob

00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,886
belongs to an ex-con,
Darin Hanson.

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,193
You know this guy,
too?

00:20:12,193 --> 00:20:14,829
WILLOWS:
He ran with
Tammy's "father."

00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:16,931
Mostly from the law.

00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:18,356
So Tammy kills Dad...

00:20:18,356 --> 00:20:21,269
and she and Darin Hanson
run off together.

00:20:26,074 --> 00:20:28,309
A regular Bonnie and Clyde.

00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:30,311
 Just what Vegas needs.

00:20:35,182 --> 00:20:37,185
GRISSOM:
Let me see, Bobby.

00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:38,186
Yeah.

00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:39,954
Projectile on the left,
.45 hollow point

00:20:39,954 --> 00:20:41,289
courtesy of Adam
Brower's back.

00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:42,791
On the right

00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,357
a .45 hollow point
extracted from Dustin Bale--

00:20:45,357 --> 00:20:47,359
dead clerk
at the convenience store.

00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,361
Bullets confirm the story
told by the potato.

00:20:50,361 --> 00:20:52,967
Same gun. Two crimes. One case.

00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:54,135
Three suspects.

00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:55,670
Adam Brower, deceased.

00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,362
Tammy Felton, Darin Hanson,
still at large.

00:20:58,362 --> 00:20:59,841
STOKES:
Hey, guys.

00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,710
I just got a call from Brass.

00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,746
We got a possible getaway
vehicle off I-93.

00:21:04,746 --> 00:21:06,314
What makes you think
it's the right car?

00:21:06,314 --> 00:21:07,315
It's beige

00:21:07,315 --> 00:21:09,360
abandoned, '77
Mercury Cougar.

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,020
Mercury's a division of Ford.

00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,822
I'll drive.

00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,355
A trucker called it in.

00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,173
Well, if that's the getaway car

00:21:32,173 --> 00:21:35,356
there would have been a
secondary vehicle parked nearby.

00:21:35,356 --> 00:21:37,356
Yeah. Check for treads, Jim?

00:21:37,356 --> 00:21:40,148
Yeah.

00:21:40,148 --> 00:21:41,883
Shall we?

00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,363
Let's go.

00:21:56,865 --> 00:21:59,701
If you were stashing a car,
where would you hide it?

00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:02,103
All these bushes would
provide good cover.

00:22:04,672 --> 00:22:05,940
Oh...

00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,360
check out that dirt
displacement.

00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,711
Yeah.

00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:12,747
 Skid mark; one tire.

00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:19,754
Where's the other one?

00:22:19,754 --> 00:22:21,856
There isn't one.

00:22:21,856 --> 00:22:24,926
(<i>engine revving)</i>

00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:29,362
Dirt to pavement

00:22:29,362 --> 00:22:31,356
then the trail goes cold.

00:22:33,768 --> 00:22:35,804
No damage. This car
was barely moving.

00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:37,359
It was dumped.

00:22:38,673 --> 00:22:39,774
Detail...

00:22:39,774 --> 00:22:42,043
 pop the trunk.

00:22:47,148 --> 00:22:49,150
Thanks.

00:22:54,356 --> 00:22:57,361
It's Tammy.

00:22:57,361 --> 00:22:59,260
(<i>flies buzzing)</i>

00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,065
Contusions on the anterior neck.

00:23:04,065 --> 00:23:06,668
Streaking erythema
on the lateral aspect

00:23:06,668 --> 00:23:08,303
of zone one.

00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,672
Cartilaginous tracheal rings
are crushed.

00:23:10,672 --> 00:23:13,107
Hey, Doc.

00:23:13,107 --> 00:23:14,358
Catherine.

00:23:14,358 --> 00:23:16,354
(<i>recorder clicks off)</i>

00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:19,180
She didn't put up
a fight, did she?

00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,715
How'd you know?

00:23:20,715 --> 00:23:23,359
She was killed by the one
person in life she trusted.

00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:34,863
(<i>gagging)</i>

00:23:34,863 --> 00:23:37,198
Darin Hanson stared her
in the face

00:23:37,198 --> 00:23:39,133
and she never saw it coming.

00:23:39,133 --> 00:23:40,835
Put his thumbs
around her air pipe

00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:42,237
and pushed.

00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:44,363
(<i>choking)</i>

00:23:46,363 --> 00:23:48,354
I swabbed her neck.

00:23:48,354 --> 00:23:50,879
Affirmative
for epithelials.

00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:54,115
I'll run them against
Darin Hanson's DNA.

00:23:54,115 --> 00:23:56,851
Parents called.
They're on their way in to I.D.

00:23:56,851 --> 00:23:59,287
How did they sound?

00:23:59,287 --> 00:24:02,023
Oddly, relieved.

00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:06,360
 They finally know where she is.

00:24:16,361 --> 00:24:18,740
I'm not pulling it.

00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,354
I found similar dust on Adam
Brower's dirty clothes.

00:24:21,354 --> 00:24:23,211
 Check it out.

00:24:30,718 --> 00:24:32,354
Real-life fairy dust.

00:24:32,354 --> 00:24:35,356
Yeah, it turns grown men
into criminals.

00:24:35,356 --> 00:24:37,025
What's the composition?

00:24:37,025 --> 00:24:38,026
S-I...

00:24:38,026 --> 00:24:41,195
O-2. Silica dust.

00:24:41,195 --> 00:24:43,231
Each particle's
a hundred times smaller

00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,363
than a grain of sand.

00:24:44,363 --> 00:24:47,359
I thought you guys
were processing the car.

00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:50,362
Yeah, um... what do you
know about silica?

00:24:50,362 --> 00:24:52,006
It's used to make glass.

00:24:52,006 --> 00:24:53,708
It's mined in open pits.
Why?

00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,944
STOKES:
Silica found both on
Adam Brower's clothing

00:24:55,944 --> 00:24:57,745
and the getaway vehicle.

00:24:57,745 --> 00:25:01,282
There's an abandoned silica mine
outside Cal Nev Ari.

00:25:01,282 --> 00:25:02,984
 What<i>don'tyou know?</i>

00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:06,321
(<i>sirens blaring)</i>

00:25:44,058 --> 00:25:46,060
Come here.

00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,356
Motorcycle tracks

00:25:52,356 --> 00:25:54,068
at the vehicle dump site.

00:26:08,216 --> 00:26:11,719
Yeah, that smells nice.

00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:13,888
Shouldn't smell at all,
if this place is abandoned.

00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:24,699
Get your guns out.

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,316
Say hello to Darin Hanson.

00:26:47,655 --> 00:26:50,792
 Shot with a .45.

00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,362
Execution style.

00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,196
STOKES:
Adam, Tammy...

00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,765
now Darin... all dead.

00:26:57,765 --> 00:26:59,934
And we're out of suspects.

00:27:01,472 --> 00:27:05,840
GRISSOM:
Three robbers
hold up the casino.

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,358
Tammy was in black,
Adam was the one in blue

00:27:08,358 --> 00:27:10,044
and that leaves us Darin.

00:27:10,044 --> 00:27:11,846
We found Darin
and Tammy's prints

00:27:11,846 --> 00:27:13,247
at the convenience store.

00:27:13,247 --> 00:27:15,917
Hours before the heist,
the clerk gets murdered.

00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:17,361
(<i>gunshot)</i>

00:27:17,361 --> 00:27:21,689
Shot with the same gun used
to kill Adam at the casino.

00:27:21,689 --> 00:27:23,359
The surveillance video tells us

00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,362
that Darin was the only one
in position to shoot Adam.

00:27:28,296 --> 00:27:29,997
Why did Darin kill Adam?

00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:31,699
SIDLE:
Greed.

00:27:31,699 --> 00:27:33,360
Fewer slices. Bigger pieces.

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,358
Which explains why
he killed Tammy.

00:27:36,358 --> 00:27:37,362
(<i>gagging)</i>

00:27:37,362 --> 00:27:38,873
(<i>grunting)</i>

00:27:38,873 --> 00:27:39,974
That's confirmed?

00:27:39,974 --> 00:27:41,361
Epithelials on her neck

00:27:41,361 --> 00:27:43,359
are a match to Darin's DNA.

00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:46,357
So, Darin thought
he was getting the whole score.

00:27:46,357 --> 00:27:47,360
But now he's dead.

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,985
So, who killed him,
and where's the money?

00:27:50,985 --> 00:27:52,359
And we still don't know why

00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:55,358
Darin and Tammy took out
the convenience store clerk.

00:27:55,358 --> 00:27:56,891
Why kill a man for
a few hundred bucks

00:27:56,891 --> 00:27:59,727
when you're about to steal
a few hundred thousand?

00:27:59,727 --> 00:28:01,762
We've got more questions
than answers.

00:28:01,762 --> 00:28:04,065
I just got off the phone
with the Laughlin CSI

00:28:04,065 --> 00:28:06,355
assigned to last month's
Cottage Casino case.

00:28:06,355 --> 00:28:08,102
He told me
the casino's cameras

00:28:08,102 --> 00:28:11,356
captured four assailants,
not three.

00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,241
Maybe Tower Club
surveillance

00:28:13,241 --> 00:28:14,709
missed something.

00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:17,357
Actually, it didn't.<i>Wedid.</i>

00:28:17,357 --> 00:28:18,946
Tower Casino surveillance.

00:28:18,946 --> 00:28:20,281
The screen on your left

00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:23,851
the camera's trained over where
Tammy, Darin and Adam entered.

00:28:23,851 --> 00:28:28,354
The screen on your right is
trained on the gaming tables.

00:28:28,354 --> 00:28:31,058
Okay, check it out.

00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:35,963
What are we looking for?

00:28:35,963 --> 00:28:38,356
What, you missed him?
All right...

00:28:38,356 --> 00:28:40,067
I'll play it again...

00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:42,361
slower, just for you.

00:28:42,361 --> 00:28:45,356
Now, keep your
eye trained

00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,355
on the pit boss

00:28:47,355 --> 00:28:49,277
and the chandelier.

00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:53,948
He ducked before
the chandelier fell.

00:28:53,948 --> 00:28:55,716
Yeah, before Tammy drew her gun.

00:28:55,716 --> 00:28:56,951
Play it again.

00:28:56,951 --> 00:28:58,819
(<i>keys clacking)</i>

00:29:02,023 --> 00:29:03,858
GRISSOM:
Well done, Warrick.

00:29:03,858 --> 00:29:05,860
You found our mole.

00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,829
Pit boss' name
is Max Duncan.

00:29:08,829 --> 00:29:11,265
Started working there
about three weeks ago.

00:29:11,265 --> 00:29:12,357
Before that...

00:29:12,357 --> 00:29:13,734
Let me guess.

00:29:13,734 --> 00:29:15,359
Laughlin, Cottage Casino?

00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:18,172
I'll call Brass.

00:29:18,172 --> 00:29:19,840
He can make the arrest.

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,359
I'll meet him at the station.

00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,177
Call you with an update.

00:29:39,126 --> 00:29:40,962
Max Duncan?

00:29:40,962 --> 00:29:42,830
Yeah. What the hell
is going on here?

00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,665
You going somewhere?

00:29:44,665 --> 00:29:46,801
What's it to you?
I'll tell you
how this works:

00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:49,670
I'll ask the questions;
you give the answers downtown.

00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,357
I'm calling my lawyer.

00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:54,308
Good idea.

00:29:56,811 --> 00:30:00,355
Max... are you clairvoyant?

00:30:00,355 --> 00:30:01,362
Excuse me?

00:30:01,362 --> 00:30:04,285
WILLOWS:
Surveillance tape
from the Tower Club Casino.

00:30:04,285 --> 00:30:07,363
You ducked before there
was a reason to cover.

00:30:07,363 --> 00:30:10,858
I saw a gun;
I hit the ground.

00:30:10,858 --> 00:30:12,994
BRASS:
Okay, let's try this.

00:30:12,994 --> 00:30:14,996
Why were you leaving town?

00:30:14,996 --> 00:30:16,964
Trying to beat a murder rap?

00:30:16,964 --> 00:30:19,300
I didn't kill anyone.

00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,802
You forget about Darin Hanson?

00:30:21,802 --> 00:30:23,362
Your car
was covered

00:30:23,362 --> 00:30:26,274
with gray dust-- silica.

00:30:26,274 --> 00:30:28,909
It places you
at the murder scene.

00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:30,311
I didn't kill him.

00:30:30,311 --> 00:30:31,912
Max...
I went there, but ...

00:30:31,912 --> 00:30:33,748
I'm advising you not
to say another word.

00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,283
No, I want to clear this up.

00:30:35,283 --> 00:30:38,753
All right, I went out to the
mine, but I didn't kill Darin.

00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,087
He was already dead.

00:30:41,856 --> 00:30:48,162
All right, look, I...
I'll admit I helped him out.

00:30:48,162 --> 00:30:50,965
I... I told him when
and where to hit.

00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:52,833
That's why I ducked.

00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:54,355
But that's it.

00:30:54,355 --> 00:30:55,970
That's a lot.

00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,772
WILLOWS:
And it still
doesn't explain

00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,874
why you went to see Darin.

00:30:59,874 --> 00:31:01,208
Max, that is enough.

00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:03,356
Well, I went
to collect my share...

00:31:03,356 --> 00:31:05,179
but the money was gone

00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:07,181
Darin was dead,
and I panicked.

00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:09,354
But I didn't shoot him.

00:31:09,354 --> 00:31:11,952
You can't get me
for murder on this.

00:31:11,952 --> 00:31:14,822
When someone is killed during
a commission of a felony

00:31:14,822 --> 00:31:17,024
all the conspirators
are liable.

00:31:17,024 --> 00:31:18,363
Darin Hanson shot Adam Brower

00:31:18,363 --> 00:31:21,128
but you might as well
have pulled the trigger.

00:31:24,832 --> 00:31:26,357
Let's make a deal.

00:31:26,357 --> 00:31:29,036
Tell me, who else was involved?

00:31:29,036 --> 00:31:30,359
Who killed Darin?

00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:35,176
Look, Darin was the only one
that I spoke to.

00:31:35,176 --> 00:31:38,356
I never even met
the other three.

00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:40,356
Then we got no deal.

00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:42,216
BRASS:
Officer.

00:31:43,217 --> 00:31:44,356
Let's go.

00:31:55,996 --> 00:31:58,354
You know what?
I kind of believe him.

00:31:58,354 --> 00:32:00,357
Yeah, me, too.

00:32:00,357 --> 00:32:02,703
He confirmed a fourth.

00:32:02,703 --> 00:32:04,357
Darin plus three.

00:32:04,357 --> 00:32:05,362
Just like
Laughlin.

00:32:05,362 --> 00:32:08,109
So, the last man standing
killed Darin.

00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:10,111
And he's still out there...

00:32:10,111 --> 00:32:15,149
flushed with cash
and a .45 caliber.

00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:17,361
JOHNSON:
Surveillance stills
from the Laughlin heist.

00:32:17,361 --> 00:32:21,222
Four perps; we've identified
three: Darin, Tammy and Adam.

00:32:21,222 --> 00:32:22,362
All deceased.

00:32:22,362 --> 00:32:24,091
Yeah. All murdered.

00:32:24,091 --> 00:32:25,760
JOHNSON:
That leaves one.

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,027
I.D. the "Unknown"

00:32:27,027 --> 00:32:30,131
good chance we solve both cases:
Laughlin and Vegas.

00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:32,363
Except all we got
is a guy in drag.

00:32:32,363 --> 00:32:35,136
Well, that's why I'm here.

00:32:35,136 --> 00:32:36,362
(<i>typing)</i>

00:32:36,362 --> 00:32:38,362
I've divided the photo
into segments

00:32:38,362 --> 00:32:41,356
removed the disguise
and rebuilt the original image

00:32:41,356 --> 00:32:43,277
based on male
physiological norms.

00:32:43,277 --> 00:32:44,979
Now, it's not exact

00:32:44,979 --> 00:32:48,359
but you'll have an idea
of what your guy looks like.

00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,362
That's Dustin Bale.

00:32:57,362 --> 00:32:59,727
The clerk from the
convenience store.

00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,895
Whoa. Hold on.

00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,964
He was killed hours
before the Tower Club heist.

00:33:03,964 --> 00:33:06,356
In on Laughlin, out on Vegas.

00:33:06,356 --> 00:33:09,036
So, Darin
took him out first.

00:33:09,036 --> 00:33:12,173
They cleared the register just
to make it look like a robbery.

00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:15,009
But the pit boss said
it was Darin plus three.

00:33:15,009 --> 00:33:17,912
Because he knew there were four
at the Laughlin heist.

00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:20,881
Well, maybe he didn't know
that the clerk wasn't there.

00:33:20,881 --> 00:33:22,216
He wasn't counting wigs.

00:33:22,216 --> 00:33:24,363
He was hiding under
a blackjack table.

00:33:24,363 --> 00:33:27,354
And we're back to
who killed Darin Hanson.

00:33:29,657 --> 00:33:30,658
Bobby D.

00:33:30,658 --> 00:33:31,659
Yeah?

00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:33,661
We need your help.

00:33:33,661 --> 00:33:36,263
Another round
from the casino heist?

00:33:36,263 --> 00:33:38,355
 Indirectly, yeah.

00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:43,357
Well, tip didn't blossom.

00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:47,141
Not a hollow point, so it's
not from Darin Hanson's gun.

00:33:47,141 --> 00:33:48,776
No, it's from his head.

00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:55,363
All right, 230 grains
gives us a .45 automatic.

00:33:55,363 --> 00:33:56,984
What else?

00:33:56,984 --> 00:34:01,357
Okay, normally, lands and
grooves are highly delineated

00:34:01,357 --> 00:34:04,356
but these are smooth, polished--
which means

00:34:04,356 --> 00:34:07,862
that your projectile was fired
from a polygonal barrel.

00:34:07,862 --> 00:34:09,356
Be right back.

00:34:14,268 --> 00:34:17,271
These are the only types
of .45 automatics

00:34:17,271 --> 00:34:18,360
with polygonal barrels.

00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,355
So, the gun that fired
your bullet

00:34:20,355 --> 00:34:24,912
was either a Heckler &amp; Koch USP
or a Glock.

00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:31,355
WILLOWS:
Narrow it further.

00:34:31,355 --> 00:34:33,359
Well, that's
what I'm doing:

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,355
dissecting your bullet.

00:34:35,355 --> 00:34:37,758
Hey, Nick.
Mm-hmm.

00:34:37,758 --> 00:34:40,160
Count the stripes.

00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,229
One, two, three

00:34:42,229 --> 00:34:44,265
four, five, six.

00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:45,361
Six lands and grooves

00:34:45,361 --> 00:34:47,356
Mm-hmm.
with a right-hand twist.

00:34:47,356 --> 00:34:50,362
Glock's got eight;
Heckler and Koch-- six.

00:34:50,362 --> 00:34:51,939
You got your gun.

00:34:51,939 --> 00:34:54,362
Let's run ATF.

00:34:54,362 --> 00:34:57,358
Pretty unique weapon.

00:34:57,358 --> 00:34:58,812
Expensive.

00:34:58,812 --> 00:35:01,357
Not exactly what you'd buy
out of the back of a van.

00:35:01,357 --> 00:35:02,950
(<i>typing)</i>

00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,358
(<i>computer beeping)</i>

00:35:04,358 --> 00:35:06,320
(<i>clears throat)</i>

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,688
Only take a second.

00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,189
(<i>printer hums)</i>

00:35:09,189 --> 00:35:12,362
See? Can I call it?

00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:14,929
Only 18 registered in-state.

00:35:14,929 --> 00:35:18,361
Ten in Clark County; seven
of them still in circulation.

00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,363
Any names jumping off the page?

00:35:24,363 --> 00:35:25,363
Just one.

00:35:25,363 --> 00:35:28,361
It's out of left field.

00:35:28,361 --> 00:35:31,361
About 75 miles out.

00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:41,358
You're accusing me of murder.

00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:44,191
And absconding with a quarter
of a mil, stolen money.

00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:45,693
Where did you stash the cash?

00:35:45,693 --> 00:35:48,028
I'm a state trooper.

00:35:48,028 --> 00:35:50,363
How does a cop hook up
with an ex-con like Darin?

00:35:50,363 --> 00:35:52,066
I can answer that.

00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,134
It's all in a day's work.

00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:00,357
(<i>gunshot)</i>

00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:07,360
A potato silencer muffles
a bullet but won't silence it.

00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,361
You went in

00:36:09,361 --> 00:36:10,718
your gun drawn.

00:36:12,363 --> 00:36:15,022
Take it easy, pal.

00:36:15,022 --> 00:36:17,057
You should have
arrested them.

00:36:17,057 --> 00:36:19,093
But something happened,
didn't it?

00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:22,096
My bet, Tammy made you an offer.

00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,361
Drop the weapon.

00:36:23,361 --> 00:36:27,101
Hey, uh, let's be smart
about this.

00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:31,305
You can take us in
or we can cut you in.

00:36:35,709 --> 00:36:38,912
They still had pockets full
of cash from the Laughlin job.

00:36:38,912 --> 00:36:40,356
They offered you

00:36:40,356 --> 00:36:41,715
a finder's fee.

00:36:43,354 --> 00:36:44,952
This isn't going to do it.

00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:47,359
It'll hold you over...
till tomorrow.

00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,991
Deal?

00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:52,292
(<i>car door shuts)</i>

00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:53,363
(<i>engine starts)</i>

00:37:02,002 --> 00:37:04,204
What are you doing?

00:37:06,363 --> 00:37:10,944
You patrol 97.5 square miles.

00:37:10,944 --> 00:37:14,114
Is the Cal Nev Ari Mine a part
of your jurisdiction?

00:37:14,114 --> 00:37:16,183
No. I'm east of the mine.

00:37:16,183 --> 00:37:17,362
But you've been there

00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:19,219
 haven't you?

00:37:36,236 --> 00:37:38,739
Where is the cash?

00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:40,908
Jim, hit the
overhead, will you?

00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:47,281
GRISSOM:
Silica is a crystal.

00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:48,782
It reflects the light.

00:37:48,782 --> 00:37:51,752
Even trace amounts
will show up.

00:37:51,752 --> 00:37:53,187
(<i>chuckles)</i>

00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:55,361
How about that?

00:38:22,182 --> 00:38:23,363
(<i>locker door opens)</i>

00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:05,192
(<i>zipper unzips)</i>

00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,361
More than I'd make
in a lifetime.

00:39:16,361 --> 00:39:18,358
Was it worth it?

00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:21,355
You wouldn't understand.

00:39:21,355 --> 00:39:22,943
WILLOWS:
That's right.

00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,812
We make the big bucks.

00:39:24,812 --> 00:39:26,046
SPENCER:
Look--

00:39:26,046 --> 00:39:28,359
I was never<i>thatguy.</i>

00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:31,084
You know, that guy
that wins the jackpots

00:39:31,084 --> 00:39:33,358
gets promoted,
catches the breaks?

00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:35,255
It was right there.

00:39:35,255 --> 00:39:37,355
Yeah, well, you're
still not that guy.

00:39:37,355 --> 00:39:38,360
Get him out of here.

00:39:47,355 --> 00:39:50,137
$250,000 turned
a career cop bad.

00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,972
Yeah, well, he had his price.

00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:56,109
We all do.
