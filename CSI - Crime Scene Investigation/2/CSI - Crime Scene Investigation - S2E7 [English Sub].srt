Did she think that
she could beat it?

Hey.

WILLOWS:
Dead center.

Question is: Why did the SUV
cross the tracks?

00:01:25,282 --> 00:01:26,783

Sheriff says we're

This entire
railroad division

00:02:16,358 --> 00:02:18,160
depends on keeping
the main line open.

00:02:18,226 --> 00:02:20,375

we can take this back
to the garage.

Well, unfortunately,
his priority

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,625
is clearing this train
from the tracks.

You have two hours.

Once we made entry,
we found the victim downstairs.

Never knew
this place existed.

The Western States
Historical Society.

I had them
cut the wires.

00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,166
We need to identify the
source of the alarm, Ray.

00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:08,836
Security company said
it was downstairs.

00:03:08,902 --> 00:03:11,004
The body's there, too.

00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:18,812
Trying to get them to turn
some more lights on in here.

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,615
There are no more
lights, O'Riley.

00:03:21,682 --> 00:03:22,850
It's a controlled
environment.

00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,651
Notice how you're
not sweating?

00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:26,587
It's probably 66
degrees in here.

00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:27,988
35% relative humidity.

00:03:28,055 --> 00:03:29,790
Too much light,
too much heat

degrades the books.

What-- nobody's
got a key?

Red foam, blue tint.

00:04:09,196 --> 00:04:10,898
Foam could be from blood

00:04:10,964 --> 00:04:12,666
in her lungs.

00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:13,701

Skin is cyanotic.

after the post.

Don't do that.

Only other person here
when the alarm sounded.

00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:48,736
Did he tell you what
he was doing here?

00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:50,137
Oh, yeah.

00:04:50,204 --> 00:04:52,373
Watching her.

00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,708
Set off the alarm,
trying to get
in the cage.

PRATT:
I wasn't watching her.

00:04:57,044 --> 00:05:00,547
I always say "good night"
to Veronica

00:05:00,614 --> 00:05:06,286
because I have to leave at 8:03
to catch the 8:10 bus.

00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:08,789
It's three blocks away.

00:05:08,856 --> 00:05:10,424
And sometimes

00:05:10,491 --> 00:05:16,964
the bus comes at 8:08,
so I have to rush to catch it.

00:05:17,031 --> 00:05:20,334
So you went down
to the basement
to say good night.

00:05:21,869 --> 00:05:23,971
"Good night, Veronica."

00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:25,439
"Good night, Aaron."

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,377
Sometimes she...
walks me to the bus.

00:05:30,444 --> 00:05:33,981
Did she walk you
to the bus tonight?

00:05:34,048 --> 00:05:36,517
"Are you coming?"

00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,820
"No. You go ahead without me.

00:05:39,887 --> 00:05:43,657
I have more work
to do."

00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:48,529
Then...

00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:50,230
a uniball pen

00:05:50,297 --> 00:05:54,568

<i>fell onto the chair...</i>

hit the floor

<i>and stopped rolling</i>
<i>at the wastebasket.</i>

00:06:05,746 --> 00:06:07,915
Then water...

00:06:10,484 --> 00:06:15,889
water falls into her eyes.

00:06:17,825 --> 00:06:19,460
You mean she was sweating?

00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:23,464
From her forehead.

00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:27,334
<i>Lots...</i>

00:06:27,401 --> 00:06:31,672
And then,
she grabs her stomach...

00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:33,974
with both hands.

00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,444

00:06:44,485 --> 00:06:47,988
Then she put on
her new face.

Shelley's Frankenstein.

00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:55,963
Up and down...

00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,865
flopping around

00:06:57,931 --> 00:07:03,404
<i>like a salmon</i>
<i>on my uncle's fishing boat.</i>

00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:07,641
She was convulsing.

00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,878
I... couldn't help her...

00:07:10,944 --> 00:07:15,582
because the cage is locked
and I don't have a key.

00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:16,684
Hey, there.

00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,055
Warrick's got three
residential burglaries, so...

00:07:22,523 --> 00:07:23,691
Mr. Pratt

00:07:23,757 --> 00:07:25,626
will you excuse me
for a moment?

00:07:28,395 --> 00:07:29,797
According
to O'Riley

00:07:29,863 --> 00:07:32,933
this guy's body language
says he's guilty.

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,401
I think he's autistic.

00:07:34,468 --> 00:07:37,404
Autistic? You mean
like Rain Man?

00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,106
Rain Man
was a savant.

00:07:39,173 --> 00:07:40,407
Extremely rare.

00:07:40,474 --> 00:07:43,177
Aaron Pratt is a
high-functioning
autistic man

00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:45,279
with superior
right-brain ability.

00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:47,181
Kind of sounds like you.

00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:50,784
The crime scene's
in the basement.

00:07:56,123 --> 00:07:58,892
Man, I hate rushing
through a crime scene.

00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,861
Two years from now,
no one is going to care

00:08:00,928 --> 00:08:03,263
that the Sheriff
turned this into
a "scoop and run."

00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,699
Call was made
above our heads.

00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:08,135
Just document the time
in your notes.

00:08:08,202 --> 00:08:10,270
Yeah, well, I'll let you
testify on this one.

00:08:10,337 --> 00:08:12,439
Thanks.

00:08:14,007 --> 00:08:17,411
Aw...
Hey, little guy.

00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:19,913
Hey.

00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,815
Hey. Let's see.

00:08:21,882 --> 00:08:24,018
His name is Maverick.

00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:25,386
He lives on

00:08:25,452 --> 00:08:27,121
Martingale Street in Henderson.

00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:29,456
That's not that far from here.

00:08:29,523 --> 00:08:31,825
Guess I'll go call
Animal Control.

00:08:31,892 --> 00:08:32,826
Okay.

00:08:32,893 --> 00:08:34,695
I'll be right back.

00:08:34,762 --> 00:08:35,863
Hey.

00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:37,097
Come on, boy.

00:08:37,164 --> 00:08:38,399
Let's get you home.

00:08:38,465 --> 00:08:39,600
So let me get
this straight--

00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,668
all you saw was a car
trying to beat the signal?

00:08:41,735 --> 00:08:43,270
I'm putting
55 miles an hour.

00:08:43,337 --> 00:08:44,338
It's dark.

00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:46,640
I got an oil leak,
can't figure out where.

00:08:46,707 --> 00:08:48,442
I looked up
and I saw something.

00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:49,743
The SUV.

00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,045
Like I said, it was dark.

00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:52,446
I thought it was stopping.

00:08:52,513 --> 00:08:53,881
I turned my head
for one second.

00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:56,250
Next thing I know, it's
in the middle of the tracks.

00:08:56,316 --> 00:08:58,085
With all due respect

00:08:58,152 --> 00:09:00,688
we've got the right
of way out here.

00:09:00,754 --> 00:09:02,389
Thanks for your time.

00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,594
That's not yours, is it?

00:09:07,661 --> 00:09:09,263
I am collecting evidence.

00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:11,265
Do we have an address
on the vic yet?

00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:12,933
855 Martingale.

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,736
Vic had a passenger.

00:09:15,803 --> 00:09:18,372
Say hello to Maverick.

00:09:20,407 --> 00:09:22,910
Have you finished with
our lady of the library?

00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:24,678
As finished as
I'm going to be.

00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:26,814
You were right. Cyanosis.

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,615
Blood was unable

00:09:28,682 --> 00:09:30,718
to oxygenate
her tissue.

00:09:35,055 --> 00:09:36,857
Explains the blue face.

00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:38,359
Underlying cause?

00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:40,661
With blood in her lungs,
asphyxiation's out.

00:09:40,728 --> 00:09:43,130
I found vomit
in her throat

00:09:43,197 --> 00:09:44,531
bloody stool, hemolysis

00:09:44,598 --> 00:09:47,368
and some irritation of the
mucous membrane on her tongue.

00:09:47,434 --> 00:09:51,038
I won't know more
till I get the blood test back.

00:09:51,105 --> 00:09:52,406
Could be blood-borne disease.

00:09:52,473 --> 00:09:54,341
I'm thinking about homicide.

00:09:54,408 --> 00:09:56,443
Then you know more than I do.

00:10:05,586 --> 00:10:06,620
It's fine.

00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:07,821
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:10:07,888 --> 00:10:09,356
Sir, you can't come in here.

00:10:09,423 --> 00:10:10,657
I told the officer upstairs.

00:10:10,724 --> 00:10:11,859
I'm Stanley Hunter.

00:10:13,327 --> 00:10:14,194
The curator.

00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:17,731
Do you have any idea
the damage you're causing?

00:10:17,798 --> 00:10:21,001
With your dust, flashbulbs.

00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:22,202
You see that?

00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:23,570
Right there, behind you.

00:10:23,637 --> 00:10:26,807
That is a 17th century text
by Johannes Van Den Avelen.

00:10:26,874 --> 00:10:30,044
It's one of two volumes
in the world.

00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,081
Now, do you go
to the Louvre

00:10:34,148 --> 00:10:36,517
and put your hands all over
the <i>Raft of the Medusa?</i>

00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,218
Officer, Mr. Hunter would like

00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:40,521
to give a statement
to Detective O'Riley.

00:10:40,587 --> 00:10:41,655
Statement?
Mm-hmm.

00:10:41,722 --> 00:10:42,756
I just got here.

00:10:42,823 --> 00:10:44,558
I don't even know
what happened.

00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:48,262
But what I do know is that
these are masterpieces.

00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:49,430
One of a kind.

00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:51,065
They're evidence
in an active

00:10:51,131 --> 00:10:53,634
criminal investigation--
also one of a kind.

00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:57,671
Mr. Hunter, why don't
we go upstairs and talk?

00:11:21,462 --> 00:11:22,830
The good news, Nick?

00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:24,565
We had a camera in here.

00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:26,900
There's no surveillance system.

00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:29,470
Yeah, there is-- Aaron Pratt.

00:11:29,536 --> 00:11:30,938
We just have
to figure out

00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:33,507
how to get the film
out of his head.

00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,701
Filament.

00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:04,470
Train probably
busted out her headlights.

00:12:04,537 --> 00:12:08,341
First thing on our list
when we get to the tow yard.

00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:14,714
Catherine...

00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:16,949
Check this out.

00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:23,523
Two sets of skid marks.

00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:26,392
One set going forward...

00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,561
( <i>tires squealing</i> )

00:12:28,628 --> 00:12:30,697
These skid marks
are about

00:12:30,763 --> 00:12:32,865
seven feet
shy of the gate.

00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:36,636
The second set
of skid marks are darker

00:12:36,703 --> 00:12:39,305
more rubber residue.

00:12:39,372 --> 00:12:41,741
Could be an overlay.

00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:49,716
Looks like the tires
were spinning in place.

00:12:49,782 --> 00:12:52,041
<i>In reverse.</i>

00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:56,489
Burning rubber.
Going nowhere.

00:12:56,556 --> 00:13:01,160
So... which set of skid marks
are telling the story?

00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:03,229
Maybe they both are.

00:13:04,564 --> 00:13:07,583
So, all of your chemicals
in here are alkaline?

00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,819
We're not dealing
with the far ends
of the pH range.

00:13:10,886 --> 00:13:13,389
See, old book pages
are slightly acidic.

00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,257
The acid eats
away the paper.

00:13:15,324 --> 00:13:17,326
We neutralize them
by a solution

00:13:17,393 --> 00:13:18,861
that's slightly
basic.

00:13:18,928 --> 00:13:20,496
To reach "7," the neutral pH.

00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:21,497
Exactly.

00:13:21,564 --> 00:13:22,531
Imidazole.

00:13:22,598 --> 00:13:24,733
15% ammonia.

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,270
That's the sort of thing
we work with here.

00:13:28,337 --> 00:13:31,273
It's all about
preserving the books.

00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:35,250
No, not that you could
even assign a value

00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,458
but do you have any idea
how much each of these books is worth?

00:13:38,656 --> 00:13:40,758
No.

00:13:40,825 --> 00:13:44,395
The first printed book
was a <i>Gutenberg Bible.</i>

00:13:44,462 --> 00:13:46,864
It sold at Christie's
for $5.3 million.

00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:49,867
Lewis and Clark's
<i>Elk Skin Journal</i>

00:13:49,934 --> 00:13:52,503
sold for $500,000.

00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:56,474
We have an illustrated
<i>Audubon, the Birds of America</i>

00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:59,208
which is worth
an estimated $300,000.

00:13:59,844 --> 00:14:01,416
All of that and you never thought about

00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,314
beefing up your security?

00:14:03,381 --> 00:14:05,917
Special collections
are kept in the vault.

00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:08,152
Any rare book
removed from the vault

00:14:08,219 --> 00:14:09,821
gets scanned
through a coder.

00:14:09,887 --> 00:14:11,289
If the book
is to be read

00:14:11,355 --> 00:14:13,891
it's delivered to
a secure room upstairs.

00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,360
And If Veronica was
going to work on it

00:14:16,427 --> 00:14:17,695
it stayed down here.

00:14:17,762 --> 00:14:18,930
Is this one
of the books

00:14:18,996 --> 00:14:20,431
that Veronica
was restoring?

00:14:20,498 --> 00:14:23,167
Yes. It...

00:14:23,234 --> 00:14:24,502
it was published
in 1797.

00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:26,337
The author was
a British botanist.

00:14:26,404 --> 00:14:28,339
It's worth
an estimated

00:14:28,406 --> 00:14:31,476
$300,000.

00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:35,012
It's really not
a dangerous profession.

00:14:40,785 --> 00:14:42,120
We got a situation.

00:14:42,186 --> 00:14:43,855
You know
that weird guy?

00:14:43,921 --> 00:14:47,525
He's not weird, O'Riley,
he's autistic.

00:14:47,592 --> 00:14:48,893
Whatever. First on the scene,

00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,063
and he's got
sticky fingers.

00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,151
"But I will wear my
heart upon my sleeve

00:14:56,218 --> 00:14:57,419
"for daws to peck at.

00:14:57,486 --> 00:14:59,416
I am not
what I am."

00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,623
<i>Othello,</i> Act One,
Scene One.

00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:06,458
Line 61 and 62,
Iago to Roderigo.

00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,593
Very good, Aaron.

00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,694
Now, you want to tell me

00:15:08,761 --> 00:15:10,529
how <i>Othello</i> ended up
in your briefcase?

00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:16,068
It's my... favorite
Shakespeare tragedy.

00:15:16,135 --> 00:15:17,603
I like
<i>Hamlet</i> myself.

00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,972
And I bet Mr. Hunter
is into <i>King Lear.</i>

00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:22,508
He's very concerned
with property rights.

00:15:22,574 --> 00:15:25,878
He tells me the rare books
are kept in the vault

00:15:25,944 --> 00:15:28,213
and they're not
allowed off-site.

00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,149
Mr. Hunter doesn't like me.

00:15:30,215 --> 00:15:32,818
I don't think the rule
was made with you in mind.

00:15:32,885 --> 00:15:35,654
He breaks the rules
all the time.

00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:37,690
He takes the books home?

00:15:37,756 --> 00:15:41,827
No. He... eats his lunch
in his office.

00:15:41,894 --> 00:15:44,496
Carrots, celery

00:15:44,563 --> 00:15:48,500
tuna on whole wheat...

00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:50,369
and Veronica.

00:15:52,171 --> 00:15:54,173
What do you mean,
"and Veronica"?

00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:58,277
She's eating

00:15:58,344 --> 00:16:03,182
and he takes her sandwich...

00:16:03,248 --> 00:16:05,351
<i>and he puts his hand</i>

00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:07,386
<i>on her breasts.</i>

00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:12,725
<i>And then he puts</i>

00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,527
<i>his tongue...</i>

00:16:15,594 --> 00:16:16,996
Aaron, I get it.

00:16:17,062 --> 00:16:18,631
Did they know

00:16:18,697 --> 00:16:20,432
that you were watching them?

00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:37,149
Hey, you know that filament
you picked up?

00:16:37,216 --> 00:16:38,884
Yeah.

00:16:38,951 --> 00:16:41,520
The lamp cover's smashed,
but the filament's intact.

00:16:41,587 --> 00:16:44,056
So what, the filament's
from another car?

00:16:44,123 --> 00:16:46,558
Well, taillights have
different filaments

00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,861
so... yeah.

00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:51,730
Paint transfer.

00:16:51,797 --> 00:16:52,998
Recent?

00:16:53,065 --> 00:16:54,233
Hard to say.

00:17:01,106 --> 00:17:03,809
You know, this right rear tire's
lost a lot of rubber.

00:17:08,447 --> 00:17:10,215
I got a cell phone.

00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,057
Battery's dead.

00:17:18,123 --> 00:17:19,425
Hey, Catherine...

00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:22,528
her emergency brake
is still on.

00:17:23,896 --> 00:17:25,297
Maybe her brakes failed

00:17:25,364 --> 00:17:26,799
or she had to engage it

00:17:26,865 --> 00:17:27,967
for some reason.

00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:29,001
You know, I'm thinking

00:17:29,068 --> 00:17:30,869
that maybe another vehicle
was involved.

00:17:30,936 --> 00:17:33,639
Engineer didn't mention anything
about a second driver.

00:17:33,706 --> 00:17:35,975
Maybe he didn't see it.

00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:40,045
15 minutes before
my next post.

00:17:40,112 --> 00:17:43,315
Hey.

00:17:43,382 --> 00:17:45,718
Great room.

00:17:45,784 --> 00:17:47,653
Great table.

00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,221
I could use this.

00:17:49,288 --> 00:17:51,657
Lay out all
the body parts.

00:17:51,724 --> 00:17:52,992
Get a real overview.

00:17:53,058 --> 00:17:54,827
Is that a light
under there?

00:17:54,893 --> 00:17:58,631
Do you have something for me?

00:17:58,697 --> 00:18:00,032
Oh, your vic.

00:18:00,099 --> 00:18:01,033
Poisoned.

00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,868
Substance as yet
unidentified.

00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:04,570
Well, there's
no smoking gun

00:18:04,637 --> 00:18:06,105
in any of these bottles.

00:18:06,171 --> 00:18:08,841
What's on the label
is what's in the bottle.

00:18:08,907 --> 00:18:10,075
Isopropyl alcohol...

00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:11,677
15% ammonia solution...

00:18:11,744 --> 00:18:12,678
imidazole...

00:18:12,745 --> 00:18:13,846
bleach.

00:18:13,912 --> 00:18:15,247
When you isolate the toxin

00:18:15,314 --> 00:18:17,683
you'll have a better idea
where it came from.

00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,817
Nick.

00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:20,352
Hmm?

00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:22,354
I love this table.

00:18:23,989 --> 00:18:27,826
There's no glass
on the filament.

00:18:27,893 --> 00:18:29,862
10:30 at night?

00:18:29,928 --> 00:18:31,163
Crim 101.

00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,632
If a guy's driving along
at night with his lights on...

00:18:33,699 --> 00:18:35,801
<i>gets in a wreck, glass breaks</i>

00:18:35,868 --> 00:18:37,469
<i>fuses to the filament.</i>

00:18:37,536 --> 00:18:40,806
Instant evidence.

00:18:40,873 --> 00:18:42,941
But there's no glass
on the filament.

00:18:43,008 --> 00:18:44,510
His headlights
weren't on.

00:18:56,422 --> 00:18:59,959
Black car... headlights off.

00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:02,628
Easy for an engineer to miss.

00:19:02,695 --> 00:19:04,363
So he hit
our SUV.

00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:08,167
Accidental or intentional?

00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:10,035
Hard to tell.

00:19:10,102 --> 00:19:11,437
Maybe not.

00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:24,683
These books are from
the Historical Society.

00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,884
That's my mail.

00:19:25,951 --> 00:19:28,988
Aaron, what about these books?

00:19:29,054 --> 00:19:31,056
Don't... don't
mix those up.

00:19:31,123 --> 00:19:33,258
I have two bills
due tomorrow--

00:19:33,325 --> 00:19:34,493
gas and electric--

00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,696
and I have to mail
them on my way to work.

00:19:37,763 --> 00:19:38,731
Don't.

00:19:38,797 --> 00:19:40,866
You're messing
everything up.

00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:44,069
Aaron, may I have
a glass of water, please?

00:19:44,136 --> 00:19:46,538
Of course you may.

00:19:46,605 --> 00:19:47,973
Thank you.

00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:54,113
Is this guy
the real deal?

00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:56,515
I think he's incapable
of deception, Nick.

00:19:56,582 --> 00:19:59,618
We're just witnessing
displaced anxiety.

00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:01,186
I mean, look around.

00:20:01,253 --> 00:20:03,589
Everything's
in precise order.

00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,558
Organized by size.

00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,208
GRISSOM:
Order provides comfort.

00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,791
His whole life is based
on routine.

00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,291
Without it,
he can't function.

00:20:13,465 --> 00:20:15,834
I'll check out
the bedroom.

00:20:15,901 --> 00:20:18,604
Mountain spring water,
Calistoga, California.

00:20:18,671 --> 00:20:20,039
Bottled at the source.

00:20:20,105 --> 00:20:21,573
Thank you.

00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,242
You're welcome.

00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:24,977
Now, how did these
books get here?

00:20:25,044 --> 00:20:27,246
Veronica brought them.

00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:29,581
She was here?

00:20:29,648 --> 00:20:32,084
Yes, she was here.

00:20:32,151 --> 00:20:34,086
We date.

00:20:34,153 --> 00:20:37,122
What do you mean you date?

00:20:37,189 --> 00:20:42,661
We have dinner--
roast beef, baked potato...

00:20:42,728 --> 00:20:45,664
organic broccoli...
Acacia

00:20:45,731 --> 00:20:47,132
Pinot Noir.

00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:49,702
<i>Shakespeare in Love.</i>

00:20:49,768 --> 00:20:51,570
DVD. Miramax.

00:20:51,637 --> 00:20:56,041
M-C-M-X-C-V-I-I-I.

00:20:58,077 --> 00:21:00,679
You two were involved
with each other?

00:21:00,746 --> 00:21:04,850
Why? Don't you think she would
date someone like me?

00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:06,051
No. You told me

00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:09,021
Veronica was involved
with Mr. Hunter.

00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:12,658
I have a Masters
in Library Science

00:21:12,725 --> 00:21:15,794
and an English degree from UNLV.

00:21:15,861 --> 00:21:18,097
And some people

00:21:18,163 --> 00:21:22,434
like Mr. Hunter, treat me
like a freak.

00:21:22,501 --> 00:21:24,870
But Veronica
didn't.

00:21:24,937 --> 00:21:28,841
She... loved me.

00:21:28,907 --> 00:21:30,476
Not him.

00:21:30,542 --> 00:21:31,710
STOKES:
Grissom.

00:21:31,777 --> 00:21:34,713
You might want to come
back here a sec.

00:21:36,248 --> 00:21:37,716
Thank you.

00:21:46,225 --> 00:21:48,527
Personal effects.

00:21:48,594 --> 00:21:52,298
Like some creepy
little shrine.

00:21:53,532 --> 00:21:56,500
Vic's hair.
She was seeing Hunter.

00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,038
Aaron got jealous.

00:22:01,307 --> 00:22:04,643
Incapable of
deception, huh?

00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,445
How do you feel about murder?

00:22:10,382 --> 00:22:13,886
"Yet she must die
else she betray more men.

00:22:13,953 --> 00:22:18,090
Put out the light,
and then put out the light."

00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:26,943
Last call on her
cell phone was to 911.

00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,113
Reel to reel's already
interfaced on my computer.

00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,982
DISPATCHER:
911, what's your emergency?

00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:35,018
MEGAN:
Oh, God, you've got to help me,
please, help me.

00:22:35,085 --> 00:22:36,519
Ma'am, try to calm down.
Where are you?

00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:38,088
I'm in my car.

00:22:38,154 --> 00:22:39,656
There's this maniac,
he's following me...

00:22:39,723 --> 00:22:41,024
Ma'am, what's your location?

00:22:41,091 --> 00:22:42,459
Help me, please!

00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:43,526
( <i>dog barking</i> )

( <i>train whistle blowing</i> )

00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:47,597
Can you isolate
the individual tracks?

00:22:47,664 --> 00:22:48,698
Yes, ma'am.

00:22:48,765 --> 00:22:49,933
Good. Lose the dog.

00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:51,701
Train, too, please.

00:22:52,936 --> 00:22:55,472
DISPATCHER:
Ma'am, what's your location?

00:22:55,538 --> 00:22:57,006
MEGAN:
Help me, please!

00:22:57,073 --> 00:22:58,708
Oh, my God!

00:22:58,775 --> 00:23:00,577
( <i>tires screeching</i> )

00:23:04,948 --> 00:23:06,383
She was flooring it.

00:23:06,449 --> 00:23:07,851
With the emergency brake on?

00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:09,219
It doesn't make any sense.

00:23:09,285 --> 00:23:11,287
Okay, lose
the victim's voice

00:23:11,354 --> 00:23:12,422
and let's just
hear the car.

00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,058
( <i>tires screeching</i> )

00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:17,093
( <i>engines running</i> )

00:23:18,728 --> 00:23:20,563
Two engines.

00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,531
Separate them out.

00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:28,701
SUV -- sounds like
any regular four-cylinder.

00:23:31,337 --> 00:23:32,772
( <i>engine running</i> )

00:23:33,326 --> 00:23:34,927
Sounds like the same thing.

00:23:34,994 --> 00:23:36,162
Hang on.

00:23:39,232 --> 00:23:42,134
( <i>whirring</i> )

00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:43,769
You hear that?

00:23:43,836 --> 00:23:46,205
Turbo. Probably diesel.

00:23:50,877 --> 00:23:52,879
She definitely likes you.

00:23:55,114 --> 00:23:58,050
You ever see <i>The Attack of</i>
<i>the Killer Tomatoes?</i>

00:23:58,117 --> 00:24:00,653
'Cause there's something
in the victim's blood

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,855
that looks like one
of those Heirlooms.

00:24:02,922 --> 00:24:04,891
Well, it's not
pulling a spectra.

00:24:04,957 --> 00:24:06,125
It's not a chemical.

00:24:06,192 --> 00:24:09,028
No, it's a large,
ugly, globular mass.

00:24:09,095 --> 00:24:10,463
You know, it's
probably a protein

00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:12,865
'cause it's the largest mass
of anything in the body--

00:24:12,932 --> 00:24:15,134
except organs, of course.

00:24:15,201 --> 00:24:16,335
But it's foreign.

00:24:16,402 --> 00:24:17,937
How did it get in there?

00:24:18,004 --> 00:24:19,739
Cart before the horse, Nick.

00:24:19,805 --> 00:24:21,340
First you identify it

00:24:21,407 --> 00:24:23,442
then you figure out
where it came from.

00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:27,013
I always thought
you kept your porn in there.

00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,848
I move it around.

00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,585
Okay, now, this is

00:24:32,652 --> 00:24:37,023
a 66-kilodalton globular
protein, composed of

00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:39,358
two disulfide-linked subunits,
A and B.

00:24:39,425 --> 00:24:41,394
Very impressive.

00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,596
And I know what you
all think of me--

00:24:43,663 --> 00:24:46,098
I'm just another pretty face

00:24:46,165 --> 00:24:47,600
who got to where I am

00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:49,602
by sleeping with Catherine.

00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:53,105
But seriously...

00:24:53,172 --> 00:24:55,842
Phi Beta Kappa, Stanford.

00:24:55,908 --> 00:24:58,077
Can I help it if I'm hip?

00:24:58,144 --> 00:25:00,680
Yeah, yeah, which one of
your relatives got you in?

00:25:00,746 --> 00:25:02,114
Full ride.

00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:04,183
Hey, eyes forward.

00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:08,688
A and B chains link together

00:25:08,754 --> 00:25:10,857
to form a large
three-dimensional structure

00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:13,159
of these beta sheets
and helices.

00:25:13,226 --> 00:25:14,861
Translation...
Wait!

00:25:14,927 --> 00:25:17,029
You just drew
the molecular structure

00:25:17,096 --> 00:25:18,431
of a foreign protein.

00:25:18,498 --> 00:25:20,800
Plant?
Correct.

00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:23,769
But, more specifically,
a lectin.

00:25:23,836 --> 00:25:25,104
( <i>gasps</i> )

00:25:25,171 --> 00:25:28,140
This is nastier
than I thought.

00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:30,743
It's ricin, a biotoxin.

00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,578
Biotoxin?
Yeah.

00:25:32,645 --> 00:25:34,480
"B chain binds
to glycoside residues

00:25:34,547 --> 00:25:37,083
"which trigger endocytotic
uptake of the protein

00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,384
"which internalizes the toxin

00:25:38,451 --> 00:25:40,153
and begins
the irreversible effects..."

00:25:40,219 --> 00:25:42,054
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
stop now.

00:25:42,121 --> 00:25:45,091
Biotoxin, as in
anthrax, smallpox?

00:25:45,158 --> 00:25:47,760
I was at that crime scene
for eight hours, man.

00:25:47,827 --> 00:25:48,995
Relax, man.

00:25:49,061 --> 00:25:52,131
It takes, like, two hours
for ricin symptoms to show

00:25:52,198 --> 00:25:53,499
and, like, 48 more
to kill you.

00:25:53,566 --> 00:25:55,768
What kind of symptoms
are we talking about, here?

00:25:55,835 --> 00:25:57,904
Um...

00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,106
Sweats?

00:26:00,173 --> 00:26:01,407
Cramps?

00:26:01,474 --> 00:26:02,508
No.

00:26:02,575 --> 00:26:03,309
Convulsions?

00:26:03,376 --> 00:26:04,477
Mm-mm.

00:26:04,544 --> 00:26:06,045
Then you're fine.

00:26:06,112 --> 00:26:08,181
And where did you say
this woman worked?

00:26:08,247 --> 00:26:10,917
Western State
Historical Society.

00:26:10,983 --> 00:26:12,819
Hey.

00:26:12,885 --> 00:26:15,655
I just got the word on
our library victim.

00:26:15,721 --> 00:26:17,690
How does ricin grab you?

00:26:17,757 --> 00:26:19,525
Well, ricin.

00:26:19,592 --> 00:26:21,027
I never would
have gone there

00:26:21,093 --> 00:26:22,595
but it explains
the irritation

00:26:22,662 --> 00:26:24,664
of the mucous membrane
on her tongue.

00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:28,100
So you think she ate the poison.

00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:29,869
I don't know about ate

00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:32,405
but the ricin made contact
with the tongue

00:26:32,471 --> 00:26:35,508
which means you're probably
looking for a powder.

00:27:39,472 --> 00:27:41,741
Day in the life.

00:27:41,808 --> 00:27:43,209
SIDLE:
Megan Treadwell

00:27:43,276 --> 00:27:45,912
wakes up at home
on Martingale Street

00:27:45,978 --> 00:27:48,314
puts the dog in the car,
heads to work

00:27:48,381 --> 00:27:49,816
at her desk by 9:00 a.m.

00:27:49,882 --> 00:27:51,617
We know this how?

00:27:51,684 --> 00:27:53,619
Brass. Talked to her boss.

00:27:53,686 --> 00:27:55,188
Why the dog?

00:27:55,254 --> 00:27:57,323
Dog went with her, every day.

00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,759
So she works till 6:00?

00:27:59,826 --> 00:28:02,161
8:00, actually. Hard worker.

00:28:02,228 --> 00:28:05,231
She packs up
and leaves the office.

00:28:05,298 --> 00:28:07,400
Except she doesn't go home.

00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:08,968
She runs an errand.

00:28:09,035 --> 00:28:11,871
I found these in the
front seat of her SUV.

00:28:11,938 --> 00:28:14,273
There's only one store in
Las Vegas that makes them.

00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,576
Yeah, it happens
all the time.

00:28:16,642 --> 00:28:20,012
Parking spaces are too narrow,
and at a premium

00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:22,448
now that the restaurant
moved in.

00:28:22,515 --> 00:28:26,719
This guy was out of line,
almost... psycho.

00:28:26,786 --> 00:28:28,821
Because of this woman?

00:28:28,888 --> 00:28:31,257
Yeah. Maverick's owner.

00:28:31,324 --> 00:28:32,725
I think her name was

00:28:32,792 --> 00:28:35,127
um, something with an M.

00:28:35,194 --> 00:28:36,629
Megan.

00:28:36,696 --> 00:28:38,231
Yeah. And this guy
yelled so loud.

00:28:38,297 --> 00:28:40,066
I came out here
just to check it out.

00:28:40,132 --> 00:28:41,801
He said something like...

00:28:41,868 --> 00:28:43,302
"You could have
killed me, bitch!"

00:28:43,369 --> 00:28:45,338
I heard it, too.

00:28:45,404 --> 00:28:47,006
Did you see it?
Kind of.

00:28:47,073 --> 00:28:49,976
I mean, I didn't hear a crash
or anything, just brakes.

00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:52,345
It seemed like
she backed out,
didn't see him.

00:28:52,411 --> 00:28:54,147
Happened right over there.

00:28:55,748 --> 00:28:57,517
( <i>engine starts</i> )

00:28:57,583 --> 00:28:59,519
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey!

00:28:59,585 --> 00:29:01,254
And that set him off.

00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,689
The last thing this guy needed
was coffee.

00:29:03,756 --> 00:29:05,191
Hey!
What?

00:29:05,258 --> 00:29:06,959
Pull your head out of your ass
and use your mirror!

00:29:07,026 --> 00:29:08,961
Was he a regular?

00:29:09,028 --> 00:29:10,830
Double latte, tall

00:29:10,897 --> 00:29:13,933
Monday through Friday
between 8:30 and 9:00.

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,602
Does Mr. Double Latte
have a name?

00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:19,972
I think it's Croft.

00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,841
Works right down
the street-- CPA.

00:29:21,908 --> 00:29:24,510
He's always telling us how
to streamline our business.

00:29:24,577 --> 00:29:26,679
How did Megan react
to Mr. Croft?

00:29:26,746 --> 00:29:28,214
She told him to go to hell.

00:29:28,281 --> 00:29:29,415
Go to hell!

00:29:29,482 --> 00:29:31,384
No, you go to hell!

00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,451
You're an ass!

00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,822
And then just drove off.

00:29:35,888 --> 00:29:38,291
And what about Mr. Croft?

00:29:38,357 --> 00:29:40,026
Everyone was just
staring at him

00:29:40,092 --> 00:29:42,428
and then he got in his car
and peeled out.

00:29:52,538 --> 00:29:53,973
<i>Ricinus communis.</i>

00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,576
Castor beans,
like castor oil.

00:29:56,642 --> 00:29:59,011
Well, botanically speaking,
it's a spurge, not a bean.

00:29:59,078 --> 00:30:01,013
Ricin is made
from the husk.

00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,849
Castor oil is made from
what's inside.

00:30:02,915 --> 00:30:04,884
Hmm, which makes two people
who know that--

00:30:04,951 --> 00:30:06,552
you and the guy
who wrote the book.

00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:07,720
Three, actually.

00:30:07,787 --> 00:30:09,722
Someone knew how to turn
this spurge into a poison.

00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:12,091
Hey, guys.

00:30:12,158 --> 00:30:13,559
That's Aaron's book, right?

00:30:13,626 --> 00:30:14,927
Mm-hmm.

00:30:14,994 --> 00:30:17,396
Shouldn't you be looking at that
under a fume hood?

00:30:17,463 --> 00:30:19,732
We brought this from his
apartment, not his office.

00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:21,767
What makes you think
there's a difference?

00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:24,103
He probably cooked up that ricin
in his kitchen.

00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,372
Our guys didn't find
anything there.

00:30:26,439 --> 00:30:28,241
So he cleans up well.

00:30:28,307 --> 00:30:31,511
What, you're not feeling sorry
for this guy, now, are you?

00:30:31,577 --> 00:30:32,778
Hey, man, he is autistic.

00:30:32,845 --> 00:30:34,647
Anybody else would be in a cell
right now.

00:30:41,787 --> 00:30:45,024
Yes, I've heard of ricin.

00:30:45,091 --> 00:30:48,928
Georgy Markov, 1978.

00:30:48,995 --> 00:30:52,798
Bulgarian political
refugee in London

00:30:52,865 --> 00:30:54,433
assassinated by injection

00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:59,272
with a ricin pellet
shot out of a black umbrella.

00:30:59,338 --> 00:31:01,474
Died two days later.

00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:04,577
Not that different from
the way Veronica died, is it?

00:31:09,415 --> 00:31:11,884
I found this book
in your apartment.

00:31:11,951 --> 00:31:13,686
What if I also told you

00:31:13,753 --> 00:31:15,621
that I found your fingerprint
on this page?

00:31:15,688 --> 00:31:19,125
Page 153.

00:31:19,192 --> 00:31:21,794
I don't touch
that book anymore.

00:31:21,861 --> 00:31:23,729
But you did touch it.

00:31:23,796 --> 00:31:26,332
Why are you mad at me?

00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:27,633
Answer the question.

00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,569
I don't touch this book anymore.

00:31:29,635 --> 00:31:30,736
It doesn't feel right.

00:31:30,803 --> 00:31:33,005
Ever since you
killed Veronica.

00:31:33,072 --> 00:31:35,408
I loved Veronica.

00:31:35,475 --> 00:31:37,643
What do you mean,
it doesn't feel right?

00:31:39,212 --> 00:31:41,681
Like a new bus pass.

00:31:41,747 --> 00:31:43,983
Smooth. Feel the page.

00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:46,352
It used to feel like

00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:48,955
my bus pass after a month.

00:31:49,021 --> 00:31:50,990
Now...

00:31:51,057 --> 00:31:53,359
Rough.

00:31:55,695 --> 00:31:57,063
Did you tell anyone

00:31:57,129 --> 00:31:59,131
that the illustrations
felt different?

00:31:59,198 --> 00:32:00,967
Yes.

00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:04,537
I told Veronica
and I told Mr. Hunter.

00:32:04,604 --> 00:32:06,772
She said that sometimes

00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:10,109
the books feel that way
after they've been restored.

00:32:10,176 --> 00:32:11,577
What did Mr. Hunter say?

00:32:11,644 --> 00:32:17,183
He said, "Get out of my office,
Aaron, I'm having my lunch!"

00:32:18,451 --> 00:32:21,888
Was Mr. Hunter having lunch
with Veronica again?

00:32:21,954 --> 00:32:26,492
Hard-boiled egg, celery,
fruit salad

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:27,693
iced tea.

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,295
Veronica was on a diet.

00:32:29,362 --> 00:32:31,797
She had to lose three pounds.

00:32:31,864 --> 00:32:32,965
Was this lunch different

00:32:33,032 --> 00:32:35,034
from the other lunches
you told me about?

00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,172
Yes.

00:32:39,238 --> 00:32:40,339
How?

00:32:40,406 --> 00:32:43,242
They fought.

00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:48,548
Aaron, I want you
to be very specific.

00:32:48,614 --> 00:32:50,249
Tell me what you saw.

00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:54,287
You did what?

00:32:55,922 --> 00:32:56,989
All I have is my reputation

00:32:57,056 --> 00:32:58,858
and I'm not going to let you
ruin it for me!

00:32:58,925 --> 00:33:03,196
Veronica started crying.

00:33:03,262 --> 00:33:06,766
Mr. Hunter stopped yelling.

00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:09,268
He sat down.

00:33:09,335 --> 00:33:13,072
He started eating.

00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:16,075
He cut the hard-boiled egg
in half.

00:33:20,813 --> 00:33:22,782
<i>He reached in the drawer</i>

00:33:22,849 --> 00:33:26,452
<i>and pulled out the salt shaker.</i>

00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:31,057
No sex, no food, no salt.

00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:06,127
Poison?
What are you talking about?

00:34:06,194 --> 00:34:07,695
GRISSOM:
We're talking
about ricin.

00:34:07,762 --> 00:34:09,531
The toxin that killed
Veronica Bradley.

00:34:09,597 --> 00:34:10,532
You were dating her.

00:34:10,598 --> 00:34:11,666
You ate lunch together.

00:34:11,733 --> 00:34:13,168
O'RILEY:
Opportunity.

00:34:13,234 --> 00:34:15,470
So, you mix up
a batch of ricin

00:34:15,537 --> 00:34:16,638
put it in a salt shaker.

00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,907
Next time you're breaking bread,
she asks for the salt...

00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,208
It never happened.

00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:22,911
We have a witness who says
he saw you try to kill her.

00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,179
What? Aaron?

00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:27,048
Are you sure you trust him?

00:34:27,115 --> 00:34:29,851
Normally an eyewitness is the
least reliable evidence we have.

00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,653
But in this case,
it's the most reliable.

00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,588
Veronica knew about
the forgeries.

00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:37,926
A career-ender, huh, Stanley?

00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,761
For her, not for me.

00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,396
She's the forger.

00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,933
Oh, there, there, there.

00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,401
( <i>clicks tongue</i> )

00:34:46,468 --> 00:34:48,636
I suppose he indicted me
for that, too?

00:34:48,703 --> 00:34:50,271
He's the one who came to me.

00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,173
Told me about the illustrations.

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,276
Said they felt like
his bus pass.

00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,112
Whatever that means.

00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,113
Go on.

00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,628
He even knew the page numbers.

00:34:59,628 --> 00:35:01,960
So, I checked it out
and he was right.

00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,888
Veronica was using me
and <i>mea culpa.</i>

00:35:06,955 --> 00:35:10,291
Why didn't you tell us
about the forgeries earlier?

00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,027
When she died, I thought
the problem was solved.

00:35:13,094 --> 00:35:15,897
In this business, all you have
is your reputation.

00:35:15,964 --> 00:35:17,065
There was a dozen books.

00:35:17,132 --> 00:35:19,300
I was going to remove them
from the collection

00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,804
inform the board, collect
the insurance and cut my losses.

00:35:24,806 --> 00:35:26,408
If you don't believe me

00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:28,910
go ask your
very reliable witness.

00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:33,448
Tell me again,
what did you see?

00:35:33,515 --> 00:35:37,585
Uniball pen rolls
across the desk.

00:35:37,652 --> 00:35:40,422
Falls on the chair,
hits the floor

00:35:40,488 --> 00:35:43,558
and stops rolling
at the wastebasket.

00:35:44,502 --> 00:35:48,406
Then water falls
into Veronica's eyes...

00:35:48,472 --> 00:35:51,375
Aaron, when you look
at things

00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:53,611
you see pictures in your mind.

00:35:53,678 --> 00:35:55,419
Tell me the first picture
you see

00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,002
of Veronica
in this cage.

00:35:57,002 --> 00:35:58,169
I already told you.

00:35:58,544 --> 00:36:00,628
Tell me something
you haven't told me.

00:36:00,919 --> 00:36:05,056
Tell me what Veronica was doing
before you said good night.

00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:09,393
She pulled out a canvas bag.

00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,130
Then she looked around.

00:36:13,197 --> 00:36:15,700
Why was she looking around?

00:36:15,766 --> 00:36:18,536
She was deciding something.

00:36:18,603 --> 00:36:24,942
Tell me what "Veronica
deciding something" looks like.

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,929
Thank you, Aaron.

00:36:49,419 --> 00:36:51,888
Veronica Bradley
must have loved Uniballs.

00:36:51,955 --> 00:36:54,023
She had about a dozen
at her house.

00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,793
Plus every known piece
of forgery equipment.

00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:00,544
Some people bite
their nails; she
bit her pens.

00:37:02,461 --> 00:37:03,862
Bad habit.

00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:06,732
STOKES:
I also found this

00:37:06,798 --> 00:37:08,066
under her refrigerator.

00:37:08,133 --> 00:37:10,636
Funny how people don't think
to clean there.

00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:14,640
Castor bean.

00:37:14,706 --> 00:37:16,275
<i>Ricinus communis.</i>

00:37:22,414 --> 00:37:25,217
STOKES:
<i>But if we find ricin</i>
<i>on any of the pens</i>

00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,551
from her house

00:37:26,618 --> 00:37:28,987
we'll know where she cooked up
the castor beans.

00:37:29,054 --> 00:37:30,589
And maybe how she died.

00:37:30,656 --> 00:37:33,085
Get these to Greg right away.

00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:35,252
We need the results of the ricin
ELISA test.

00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,798
I came home straight from work.

00:37:39,865 --> 00:37:41,733
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,335
You want to submit
to a lineup?

00:37:43,402 --> 00:37:45,137
A lineup?

00:37:45,203 --> 00:37:47,005
What for?

00:37:52,044 --> 00:37:54,914
His car, out in the parking lot,
it's a rental.

00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,082
Rented this morning.

00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,618
Let's just cut the b.s.
Where's your car?

00:37:58,684 --> 00:37:59,852
I sold it.

00:37:59,919 --> 00:38:01,287
You got proof of sale?

00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,024
An accountant
who doesn't keep receipts.

00:38:05,091 --> 00:38:07,326
Hey, you don't know
anything about me.

00:38:07,393 --> 00:38:08,961
I know you've got a temper.

00:38:13,399 --> 00:38:16,702
Hey. Brass did the legwork
and rushed the warrant.

00:38:16,769 --> 00:38:19,839
Found it in a body shop
a mile from his house.

00:38:19,905 --> 00:38:24,010
Black Excursion.
Turbo diesel.

00:38:27,246 --> 00:38:28,180
Gutted.

00:38:28,247 --> 00:38:29,515
Gets better.

00:38:29,582 --> 00:38:32,618
Vic's SUV was silver.

00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,321
What do you think?

00:38:35,388 --> 00:38:39,325
WILLOWS:
Well, this is a lot more
than a fender bender.

00:38:39,392 --> 00:38:40,593
Sustained contact.

00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,128
Get some scrapings.

00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:43,195
Yeah.

00:39:07,286 --> 00:39:08,721
I think I may know what...

00:39:08,788 --> 00:39:09,722
( <i>sniffs</i> )

00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:10,923
set this guy off.

00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:14,260
He spilled his coffee.

00:39:30,209 --> 00:39:32,144
Not a good color for Croft.

00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,231
Coffee on the outside,
coffee on the inside.

00:39:52,298 --> 00:39:54,066
Lipstick on the lid.

00:39:54,133 --> 00:39:55,768
She threw her coffee at him.

00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,139
WILLOWS:
<i>Croft chases her</i>
<i>from the parking lot</i>

00:40:00,206 --> 00:40:01,707
<i>caught up to her at the light.</i>

00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,110
They said their
"screw you, screw yous."

00:40:04,176 --> 00:40:05,745
I think I know
the word

00:40:05,811 --> 00:40:07,413
that made her throw the coffee.

00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,581
I hate that word.

00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:13,986
SIDLE:
<i>Those lids never fit.</i>
<i>She nailed him.</i>

00:40:14,053 --> 00:40:16,155
Light turns green
and the chase is on.

00:40:16,222 --> 00:40:18,090
WILLOWS:
<i>And now she's got a problem.</i>

00:40:18,157 --> 00:40:20,926
( <i>tires screeching</i> )

00:40:26,165 --> 00:40:27,566
She's got a pursuit
on her hands.

00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,135
And she's the pursued.

00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:30,603
So, she dials 9-1-1.

00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,538
( <i>voice over phone</i> ):
9-1-1. What's your emergency?

00:40:32,605 --> 00:40:35,174
Oh, my God, you've got help me,
please. Help me!

00:40:35,241 --> 00:40:37,777
Somehow she loses him.

00:40:37,843 --> 00:40:39,879
And she's still spooked.

00:40:39,946 --> 00:40:42,748
All she wants now
is to get home.

00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,651
( <i>tires squealing</i> )

00:40:45,718 --> 00:40:48,120
Please... pl-please.

00:40:48,187 --> 00:40:49,822
( <i>train whistle blowing</i> )

00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:52,191
( <i>brakes screeching</i> )

00:40:52,258 --> 00:40:55,928
( <i>crossing-guard bells ringing)</i>

00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:59,198
( <i>sighs with relief</i> )

00:40:59,265 --> 00:41:01,067
Hey, sweetie...

00:41:02,702 --> 00:41:04,670
Oh, God, no!

00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,040
Help me!

00:41:08,107 --> 00:41:09,842
( <i>train whistle blowing</i> )

00:41:11,744 --> 00:41:14,480
That's why she had
the emergency brake on.

00:41:25,057 --> 00:41:26,292
( <i>train whistle blowing</i> )

00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,628
She could have jumped out.

00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,663
Not without her dog.

00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:31,697
Help!

00:41:31,764 --> 00:41:32,999
( <i>tires squealing</i> )

00:41:33,065 --> 00:41:35,301
( <i>train whistle blowing</i> )

00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:36,502
No!

00:41:36,569 --> 00:41:38,704
( <i>starter grinding</i> )

00:41:38,771 --> 00:41:40,039
( <i>screams</i> )

00:41:50,149 --> 00:41:53,686
And that's why you always cut
the other driver some slack.

00:41:53,753 --> 00:41:57,623
I'll call Brass, tell him
to make the arrest.

00:41:59,992 --> 00:42:02,728
Veronica removed the
original illustrations
from the books

00:42:02,795 --> 00:42:04,263
and replaced them
with forgeries

00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,865
which she then
left at your house

00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:07,867
so that she could point
the finger at you

00:42:07,933 --> 00:42:09,068
if it ever came to that.

00:42:09,135 --> 00:42:10,903
She never thought
that you'd find out

00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:11,938
but you did.

00:42:12,004 --> 00:42:14,507
And you told
Mr. Hunter.

00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:17,510
"All you have in this business
is your reputation."

00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,912
So, Veronica tried
to save hers

00:42:19,979 --> 00:42:22,515
but instead of
killing Mr. Hunter

00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,951
she ended up killing herself.

00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:28,020
Oh.

00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,088
Sorry.

00:42:29,155 --> 00:42:31,290
That's okay.

00:42:31,357 --> 00:42:34,660
( <i>giggling</i> )

00:42:38,497 --> 00:42:40,466
I like order.

00:42:40,533 --> 00:42:43,102
Me, too.

00:42:44,503 --> 00:42:47,306
That's why I was scared.

00:42:47,373 --> 00:42:49,809
Scared?

00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:54,614
Of Veronica being in love.

00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:57,783
I was stupid.

00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:00,419
I thought she loved me.

00:43:10,229 --> 00:43:15,268
"Then must you speak of one
that loved not wisely...

00:43:15,334 --> 00:43:17,970
But too well."

00:43:18,037 --> 00:43:25,678
<i>Othello,</i> Act Five, Scene Two,
lines 343 and 344.

00:43:25,745 --> 00:43:28,014
But Othello killed Desdemona.

00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,284
I didn't kill Veronica.

00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:34,711
No, you didn't.
