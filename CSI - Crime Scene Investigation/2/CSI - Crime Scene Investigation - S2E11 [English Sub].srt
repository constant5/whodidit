00:00:14,673 --> 00:00:16,309
You’re going
to like my room.

00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:17,710
You can see
the entire Strip

00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,446
from my balcony...

00:00:19,446 --> 00:00:22,416
and the bed.

00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,952
I usually
don’t do this.

00:00:24,952 --> 00:00:27,622
I-I mean, especially with
somebody that I just met.

00:00:27,622 --> 00:00:29,090
Yeah?

00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,293
Well, I could tell that
just by looking at you.

00:00:31,293 --> 00:00:32,629
( <i>elevator bell dings</i> )

00:00:32,629 --> 00:00:35,365
Uh...

00:00:35,365 --> 00:00:37,568
Come on, don’t worry,
all right?

00:00:37,568 --> 00:00:40,438
You can trust me.

00:00:40,438 --> 00:00:41,572
Okay?

00:00:41,572 --> 00:00:43,307
Promise?

00:00:43,307 --> 00:00:45,244
I never lie.

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,583
You... are so bad.

00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:51,852
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:54,388
Yeah, I am.

00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:55,857
( <i>gasps</i> )

00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,935
( <i>gasps</i> )

00:01:07,304 --> 00:01:08,705
Hey.

00:01:08,705 --> 00:01:11,308
Dispatch said
suspicious circs.

00:01:11,308 --> 00:01:12,910
Yeah.

00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,345
We got an anonymous call
to 911

00:01:14,345 --> 00:01:16,482
at the same time
the couple found him.

00:01:16,482 --> 00:01:18,150
A male voice said:

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,588
"A man has collapsed
at the Devon. Hurry."

00:01:21,588 --> 00:01:22,755
Where’s the man?

00:01:22,755 --> 00:01:24,992
Well, he was
unconscious but breathing

00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,428
so paramedics took him
to Desert Palm Hospital.

00:01:27,428 --> 00:01:30,264
There was no bullet wounds,
no knife... nothing.

00:01:30,264 --> 00:01:31,266
You got a name?

00:01:31,266 --> 00:01:32,334
Bob Fairmont.

00:01:32,334 --> 00:01:33,568
Upscale home developer.

00:01:33,568 --> 00:01:35,237
"A Fairmont home,
you’ll never roam"?

00:01:35,237 --> 00:01:36,872
His billboards are everywhere.

00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:39,275
They took these pictures
before they moved him.

00:01:44,348 --> 00:01:46,684
Well, this is as phony as
a Chappaquiddick neck brace.

00:01:46,684 --> 00:01:48,420
The clothes are all bunched.

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,823
SIDLE:
Collar’s off
to the side

00:01:50,823 --> 00:01:52,425
leg fabric’s gathered.

00:01:52,425 --> 00:01:54,461
It’s impossible to redress
an unconscious person

00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:56,463
to make it look like
they dressed themselves.

00:01:56,463 --> 00:01:59,400
You notice anything
about the suit coat?

00:02:01,202 --> 00:02:03,439
Well, unless he’s going
to court or church

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,308
there’s no way he buttons
all three buttons.

00:02:06,308 --> 00:02:08,745
Very good, Jim.

00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:10,914

they can fool us?

Call me
if you learn anything.

00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:52,398
Hey, guys.

00:02:52,398 --> 00:02:55,234
I just pulled the manager
out of a restaurant.

00:02:55,234 --> 00:02:58,739
Bob Fairmont was staying
in room 2927.

00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:00,307
Catherine’s
parking the car.

00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:01,942
Let’s go up.

00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:03,244
We’ll meet you there.

00:03:03,244 --> 00:03:05,146
Okay.

00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:15,492
Mr. Fairmont was staying
in Murder Central.

00:03:15,492 --> 00:03:16,493
Mmm.

00:03:16,493 --> 00:03:17,561
Murder Central?

00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:18,930
You never heard
that phrase?

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,233
Well, if I did,
would I have asked the question?

00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:22,968
Sara, you’re with me
in here.

00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:24,470
You guys get the elevator.

00:03:25,904 --> 00:03:26,906
All yours, girl.

00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,041
Thanks.

00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:33,848
Sara doesn’t know
what Murder Central means

00:03:33,848 --> 00:03:35,183
any more than I do.

00:03:35,183 --> 00:03:36,985
Oh, Nick, give it up.

00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:39,455
We got a Death Imminent
to worry about.

00:03:40,522 --> 00:03:41,958
My husband’s in surgery.

00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,125
Can’t this wait?

00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,128
I’m sorry, no.

00:03:45,128 --> 00:03:47,598
He was found under
suspicious circumstances.

00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:50,601
Do you have any idea
who may have redressed
him or moved him?

00:03:50,601 --> 00:03:53,672
He usually goes with women
who look a lot like me...

00:03:53,672 --> 00:03:55,474
only younger.

00:03:56,776 --> 00:03:58,478
And I’m embarrassed to say

00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:00,714
that I’ve been flattered
by that, at times.

00:04:00,714 --> 00:04:03,417
Do you have a name?

00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:06,588
I was very much on the outside
of that part of his life.

00:04:08,656 --> 00:04:10,358
I see.

00:04:19,837 --> 00:04:21,839
I know.
The room’s talking to us.

00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,976
They had champagne.

00:04:24,976 --> 00:04:27,513
They were celebrating
something.

00:04:32,953 --> 00:04:34,922
No lipstick on
either glass.

00:04:34,922 --> 00:04:38,159
911 did say it was a man’s
voice that placed the call.

00:04:40,795 --> 00:04:42,965
Smell the musk?

00:04:42,965 --> 00:04:44,634
Hint of bleach?

00:04:48,238 --> 00:04:50,474
Sexual intercourse.

00:04:53,177 --> 00:04:54,979
They kept
the drapes open.

00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:57,983
A married man who’s
not worried about...

00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,453
photographs, long lenses...

00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:05,159
Well, he’s either careless
or arrogant, maybe.

00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:06,994
Or he has a death wish.

00:05:15,504 --> 00:05:18,641
34 C?

00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:21,044
If he was with a woman

00:05:21,044 --> 00:05:23,581
who was the guy
on the 911 call?

00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,486
Hand me that magnifier.

00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:30,489
Thank you.

00:05:30,489 --> 00:05:32,692
What do you got?

00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:34,127
See those white specks?

00:05:37,264 --> 00:05:39,701
What do you think,
cocaine?

00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:42,504
No, I don’t think so.

00:05:42,504 --> 00:05:44,539
How can you tell
just by looking?

00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:48,544
Never you mind.

00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:58,489
Let’s just get this to Trace.

00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:04,897
Okay, we’re done
in the elevator.

00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,333
You guys need a hand?

00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,002
Yeah, you want to dust
the champagne bottle?

00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:10,904
The average American hotel room

00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:14,409
is covered with stains
invisible to the naked eye.

00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:16,745
Yeah, but they’re
not all biological.

00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:20,650
Some are soda stains,
food stains, whiskey
stains, you know.

00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,520
No matter how clean
or expensive the room seems

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,357
that why I always travel
with Nonoxinol Nine.

00:06:26,357 --> 00:06:29,261
You sound like
you’re making a commercial.

00:06:29,261 --> 00:06:31,263
Nick, hit the lights,
will you?

00:06:33,432 --> 00:06:36,335
Okay, we’re looking
for the freshest stains.

00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:40,274
Soda, maybe...

00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,976
Maybe champagne...

00:06:41,976 --> 00:06:43,944
Oh! Someone’s little soldiers...

00:06:43,944 --> 00:06:47,549
not fresh, dry.

00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:50,386
More champagne.

00:06:57,728 --> 00:06:59,330
GRISSOM:
Hmm...

00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,567
"Starlight, star bright,
First star I see tonight."

00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,174
Okay, I’ll let you guys
do the collection.

00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:10,744
Thanks a lot.

00:07:10,744 --> 00:07:12,379
Oh, and Sara?

00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:13,314
Hmm.

00:07:13,314 --> 00:07:14,448
Last hotel room

00:07:14,448 --> 00:07:15,750
nearest the stairwell--

00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,785
easy entry and egress
for an intruder

00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:21,657
and if the victim fights back,
50% less chance of being heard.

00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:26,330
Rooms only on one side.
Murder Central.

00:07:31,802 --> 00:07:33,538
( <i>door closes</i> )

00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:35,707
You are <i>so</i> busted.

00:07:49,358 --> 00:07:50,960
I gave this to Trace.

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,327
Why do you have it?

00:07:52,327 --> 00:07:54,096
SANDERS:
Well, because I deal
in DNA.

00:07:54,096 --> 00:07:57,433
The smallest sliver
of epidermal tissue.

00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:58,835
This is skin.

00:07:58,835 --> 00:08:01,172
Scalp skin.

00:08:01,172 --> 00:08:02,874
Itchy.

00:08:02,874 --> 00:08:04,642
Can be embarrassing
in social situations

00:08:04,642 --> 00:08:07,012
especially if one is wearing
a dark shirt.

00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:08,481
Dandruff.

00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,487
Good chance whoever
moved the guy into
the elevator...

00:08:13,487 --> 00:08:15,890
Had a bad case of seborrhea.

00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,794
Thanks.

00:08:19,794 --> 00:08:21,029
Hey, Catherine.

00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:24,200
Do you think Sara
would ever go out with me?

00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,002
Sure.

00:08:26,002 --> 00:08:29,506
As long as you don’t tell her
it’s a date.

00:08:29,506 --> 00:08:30,841
BROWN:
<i>Hey, Cath...</i>

00:08:30,841 --> 00:08:33,611
are you on this
Fairmont case?

00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:35,346
House mogul caught
with his pants on?

00:08:35,346 --> 00:08:38,283
Yeah, I’m just rolling
to the hospital to get
his clothes. Why?

00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:39,685
You know the
Fairmont house

00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,421
was one of my first
calls three years ago?

00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,023
You serious?
For what?

00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,424
Shots fired.

00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:47,094
He shot himself while
he was cleaning his gun.

00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,495
Wow!

00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:50,598
Yeah. And after hearing
about tonight

00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:52,600
I’m wondering if that’s
what really happened.

00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,637
I’m going to pull his file
and check it out.

00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:56,239
Let me know.

00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:57,306
I will.

00:08:57,306 --> 00:08:59,576
STOKES:
Nice shot.

00:08:59,576 --> 00:09:02,412
Reservoir’s still wet.

00:09:02,412 --> 00:09:03,981
Why did he
throw it?

00:09:03,981 --> 00:09:06,284
Mmm. I’m only impressed
if he aimed.

00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:09,888
I wonder if the woman
has any idea she left
her DNA behind?

00:09:09,888 --> 00:09:12,591
Not rocket science.
Man’s inside, woman’s out.

00:09:14,294 --> 00:09:15,662
Wife says the guy’s
a player.

00:09:15,662 --> 00:09:16,897
She doesn’t know
the women.

00:09:16,897 --> 00:09:18,932
You tell her about
the 911 tape?

00:09:18,932 --> 00:09:20,000
The male voice?

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,770
Oh, I just got back
from Central Dispatch.

00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,438
The tape’s lost.
New computer system.

00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,107
Any ear-witnesses?

00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,943
The dispatcher says
it could’ve been
a woman whispering.

00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:32,282
Or a very old person,
gender indeterminate.

00:09:32,282 --> 00:09:34,418
That’s about as good
as an eyewitness.

00:09:34,418 --> 00:09:36,420
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:09:38,055 --> 00:09:39,892

00:09:39,892 --> 00:09:41,894
What?

00:09:41,894 --> 00:09:43,629
I’ll be right there.

00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:47,334
No lunch.

00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:48,935
GRISSOM:
We got a time?

00:09:48,935 --> 00:09:50,771
Well, all indications
are he was brain-dead

00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:52,740
from the time he collapsed
at the hotel.

00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,674
From?

<i>but the brain’s dead.</i>

00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,352
And it doesn’t regenerate.

00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,823
Aneurysm from trauma...
infection...?

00:10:05,823 --> 00:10:07,959
Genetic predisposition.
Both parents went that way.

00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:11,430
It increases a person’s
chance of stroke ten-fold.

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,632
He looks like an athlete.

00:10:13,632 --> 00:10:15,768
Brain dead at 38,
otherwise healthy and strong.

00:10:17,303 --> 00:10:18,839
Is this a Frankenstein?

00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,074
I was wondering
when you’d ask.

00:10:21,074 --> 00:10:24,211
Prime donor candidate.

00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:25,547
Next of kin signed off.

00:10:25,547 --> 00:10:26,681
How many organs
they take?

00:10:26,681 --> 00:10:28,550
Eight in under two hours.

00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,486
Man, those harvest doctors move,
don’t they?

00:10:30,486 --> 00:10:32,155
Stat!
Go, go, go!

00:10:32,155 --> 00:10:34,323
Here comes the liver.
Ready with a basin, please.

00:10:34,323 --> 00:10:35,459
Right now.

00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,294
And here we go.

00:10:37,294 --> 00:10:38,663
( <i>steady tone</i> )

00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:40,598
Clamp it.
Get it back,
get it back.

00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,233
Ready and got it.
Here we go.

00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:45,938
All right, I’ll notify
the PD about the organs.

00:10:50,743 --> 00:10:53,947
So I was thinking...

00:10:53,947 --> 00:10:58,086
maybe we could take our break
at the same time.

00:10:58,086 --> 00:11:00,355
Later this shift.

00:11:00,355 --> 00:11:02,357
Together.

00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:03,859
Sure.

00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:05,796
Really.

00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:12,169
Semen.
No surprise there.

00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:16,441
Well, without the DNA sample
from the hotel guy

00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:18,444
this test is pretty useless.

00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,247
I’m more interested...

00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,083
in who the woman is.

00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,519
Well, just like the bra,
I’m going to need a
reference of her DNA

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,323
in order to do anything,
and that’s not going
to happen until--

00:11:28,323 --> 00:11:29,424
What the heck?

00:11:29,424 --> 00:11:31,460
What?

00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,794
Stripes.

00:11:35,397 --> 00:11:37,667
Stripes.

00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:39,069
Transverse white bands
that appear

00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:41,405
six weeks after the onset
of symptoms of toxicity.

00:11:41,405 --> 00:11:43,407
You got a closer view?

00:11:43,407 --> 00:11:45,877
Uh...

00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,286
They look like
Mees lines to me.

00:11:53,286 --> 00:11:54,721
Could be livor mortis.

00:11:54,721 --> 00:11:57,759
Or white striae, indicative
of heavy metal poisoning.

00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,993
We can’t count
on a photo

00:11:58,993 --> 00:12:00,462
to draw that kind
of conclusion.

00:12:00,462 --> 00:12:01,964
We need the body.

00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:05,634
Don’t take this wrong,
Dr. Robbins, but...

00:12:05,634 --> 00:12:07,203
how do you
release a body

00:12:07,203 --> 00:12:09,806
that’s been redressed and
dumped in an elevator?

00:12:09,806 --> 00:12:13,177
I deal with cause of death,
which was an aneurysm

00:12:13,177 --> 00:12:16,514
and therefore, a Natural,
and based on that

00:12:16,514 --> 00:12:18,884
his body is released
to a mortuary.

00:12:18,884 --> 00:12:21,120
The whole transplant thing
didn’t raise a flag?

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,590
I thought I’d raised a flag
with the good doctor

00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,994
when I told him I was going
to notify the police department.

00:12:26,994 --> 00:12:29,797
But evidently,
I miscommunicated again.

00:12:29,797 --> 00:12:31,432
Great.

00:12:31,432 --> 00:12:33,201
( <i>typing</i> )

00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:35,304
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:12:35,304 --> 00:12:37,206
All may not be lost. Here...

00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:41,978
Body of Robert Fairmont
released at 0400 hours

00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:44,081
to the Desert Haven
Mortuary.

00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:45,082
I know that place.

00:12:45,082 --> 00:12:46,618
Well, if they haven’t
embalmed him

00:12:46,618 --> 00:12:47,852
we can still
get a blood sample,

00:12:47,852 --> 00:12:49,321
test for heavy metal
poisoning.

00:12:49,321 --> 00:12:51,056
Good. I’ll drive.

00:12:53,927 --> 00:12:55,328
You’re not coming?

00:12:55,328 --> 00:12:57,964
You found it, you run with it.

00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:01,235
You can do it. Take Nick.

00:13:01,235 --> 00:13:03,071
Okay.

00:13:07,476 --> 00:13:09,779
How long’s he been in here?

00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,049
92 minutes at
1,600 degrees.

00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:14,051
What exactly was it
that you wanted to see?

00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:15,218
His fingernails.

00:13:15,218 --> 00:13:16,320
I’m very sorry.

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,356
Who approved
this cremation?

00:13:18,356 --> 00:13:20,325
( <i>sighing</i> )

00:13:20,325 --> 00:13:22,194
His wife, Julia Fairmont.

00:13:22,194 --> 00:13:25,197
Same person who approved
the organ transplants.

00:13:31,305 --> 00:13:33,908
( <i>flames crackling</i> )

00:13:47,157 --> 00:13:50,095
BRASS:
<i>You told me</i>
<i>your husband was in surgery.</i>

00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,631
He was.

00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,533
Surgery to take
his organs

00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,102
not to save his life.

00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:59,940
He was technically... dead.

00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,975
He wanted to donate his organs.

00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:04,545
I was following his wishes.

00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:07,349
Why are you being so hostile?

00:14:07,349 --> 00:14:10,019
Someone was poisoning
your husband.

00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:11,286
What?

00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:15,358
We don’t know the dose
or the duration

00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:18,662
but we do know
the type of poison.

00:14:18,662 --> 00:14:21,599
We processed your husband’s
remains.

00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:23,000
<i>Most poisons would be</i>

00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,602
<i>completely burned off</i>
<i>by cremation</i>

00:14:24,602 --> 00:14:26,972
<i>but heavy metals</i>
<i>are very resistant to heat.</i>

00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:30,844
<i>This heavy metal is called</i>

00:14:30,844 --> 00:14:32,846
selenium.

00:14:32,846 --> 00:14:34,414
Did you notice that

00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:36,617
your husband’s breath
might have been garlicky?

00:14:36,617 --> 00:14:38,386
Garlicky?

00:14:38,386 --> 00:14:41,290
The body will excrete
demethyl selenide--

00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,724
smells just like garlic.

00:14:42,724 --> 00:14:46,429
Uh... no.

00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:48,331
The white stripes
on his fingernails--

00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:49,433
did you notice those?

00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:51,869
Um...

00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:54,072
We didn’t see each other a lot.

00:14:54,072 --> 00:14:56,141
Bob was busy building
his company.

00:14:56,141 --> 00:14:59,144
That bother you,
him never being home?

00:15:02,082 --> 00:15:05,219
I think it would bother
any woman.

00:15:07,121 --> 00:15:09,123
Did you know that
the most common choice

00:15:09,123 --> 00:15:11,526
of premeditated murder
among women is poison?

00:15:11,526 --> 00:15:13,362
They cite its passivity.

00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:18,835
I did not poison my husband.

00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,871
You cremated his body.

00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:23,007
He wanted to be cremated.
I cremated him.

00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:25,443
He wanted to donate his organs.
I did that, too.

00:15:25,443 --> 00:15:27,479
Now, if there’s nothing else,
I will be at home

00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:29,648
preparing for my husband’s
memorial service.

00:15:29,648 --> 00:15:31,083
Excuse me.

00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:35,588
Do you want us
to notify you?

00:15:35,588 --> 00:15:37,525
Of what?

00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:40,695
When we find out
the exact amount of selenium

00:15:40,695 --> 00:15:43,565
given to your husband
and over what period of time?

00:15:43,565 --> 00:15:46,168
I thought you couldn’t tell.

00:15:46,168 --> 00:15:49,272
Your husband’s gone, but
his organs are still out there.

00:15:49,272 --> 00:15:51,808
Well, good.

00:15:51,808 --> 00:15:55,046
Yes, I would like
to be notified.

00:16:01,053 --> 00:16:03,857
Straight up,
am I going to die?

00:16:03,857 --> 00:16:06,059
You have only a small
fraction of the poison

00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:07,995
that was in your
donor’s body--
one organ.

00:16:07,995 --> 00:16:09,163
With nothing
new coming in

00:16:09,163 --> 00:16:10,230
it should work
its way out.

00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,702
I must’ve had 100 tests.

00:16:13,702 --> 00:16:15,103
How’d you doctors miss this?

00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,173
A heavy metal like selenium
presents so rarely

00:16:17,173 --> 00:16:19,375
that it’s not part of
our screening protocol.

00:16:21,611 --> 00:16:24,114
You don’t look like a doctor.

00:16:24,114 --> 00:16:25,949
No, sir, no, I’m not.

00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:27,251
I’m Nick Stokes.

00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:28,987
I’m with the Las Vegas
Crime Lab.

00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:30,622
I’ll be right outside.

00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,091
Thank you, Doctor.

00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,729
I was hoping I might
be able to get

00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,599
a sample of that
new kidney of yours.

00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:40,501
A sample?

00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:41,769
Biopsy. A sliver.

00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:43,471
You mean open me up again?

00:16:43,471 --> 00:16:47,009
Maybe an invasive scope.

00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:49,145
The only way I can get
an accurate barometer

00:16:49,145 --> 00:16:51,014
of the poison
in Mr. Fairmont’s system

00:16:51,014 --> 00:16:52,516
is through
one of his organs.

00:16:52,516 --> 00:16:55,185
I’m sorry, young man,

00:16:55,185 --> 00:16:57,722
but this is my kidney now.

00:16:57,722 --> 00:16:59,424
I waited four years.

00:16:59,424 --> 00:17:02,027
I can’t have anyone
cut into me for it.

00:17:02,027 --> 00:17:03,629
I just can’t.

00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:07,099
No, hey, I understand.

00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,469
Thank you for your time.

00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:13,942
I like your watch,
man, that’s cool.

00:17:13,942 --> 00:17:15,944
It broke while
I was down in surgery--

00:17:15,944 --> 00:17:18,047
stuck on 11:00.

00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:20,449
Think the Lord’s
trying to tell me something?

00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:22,017
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:17:22,017 --> 00:17:24,354
Yeah, get it to
a watch repair shop.

00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:31,095
I hope you get to
feeling better, Mr. Mercer.

00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:43,878
Nick struck out on the kidney.

00:17:43,878 --> 00:17:45,346
I got four no’s
over the phone.

00:17:45,346 --> 00:17:48,483
One yes from a recipient
in Illinois--heart.

00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:51,487
Useless--heart has
no memory for poison.

00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,189
Why can’t we
cut the middle man

00:17:53,189 --> 00:17:55,758
and just check
the wife’s house
for selenium?

00:17:55,758 --> 00:17:58,295
All right, I know, something
about Constitutional law.

00:17:58,295 --> 00:18:00,431
Get probable cause,
then get a search warrant...

00:18:00,431 --> 00:18:03,568
Sara! I was just looking
for you.

00:18:03,568 --> 00:18:05,104
Still up for break?

00:18:05,104 --> 00:18:07,740
Sorry, Greggo. Hot case.

00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,942
I’m going to go look at
Nick’s champagne bottle.

00:18:09,942 --> 00:18:11,077
How you doing
with our DNA?

00:18:11,077 --> 00:18:12,613
Uh... inside-outside

00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:15,082
we’re still looking for
a reference for comparison

00:18:15,082 --> 00:18:17,852
but the epidermals
are looking promising.

00:18:17,852 --> 00:18:19,787
Nice.

00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:21,389
You want to clue me in?

00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:24,793
Sara and I were just
going out for dinner.

00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:26,996
On the case, <i>Greggo.</i>

00:18:26,996 --> 00:18:29,333
Oh. Right.

00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:35,974
Excuse me...

00:18:35,974 --> 00:18:38,110
I’m Claudia Gideon,
Bob Fairmont’s secretary.

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,611
I came to pick up
his property.

00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:41,280
NURSE:
Oh, I’m sorry,
but Ms. Willows

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,682
already asked for them.

00:18:42,682 --> 00:18:45,418
His property is
part of our investigation.

00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:47,155
I’m afraid
I have to take it.

00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:48,990
Oh, fine. I was
just doing my job.

00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,358
Yeah, me, too.

00:18:50,358 --> 00:18:52,026
Did you work
for the Fairmonts

00:18:52,026 --> 00:18:54,296
three years ago,
when Mr. Fairmont was shot?

00:18:54,296 --> 00:18:56,766
I was out sick that day.

00:18:56,766 --> 00:18:58,234
Interesting.

00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,373
You have dandruff.

00:19:02,373 --> 00:19:06,178
Is that really
proper etiquette?

00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,781
It is when I’m on a case.

00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,549
You mind?

00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,723
Where did you say you worked?

00:19:18,726 --> 00:19:21,196
BRASS:
I’m going to ask you again--

00:19:21,196 --> 00:19:23,832
were you in that hotel room
with Bob Fairmont?

00:19:23,832 --> 00:19:25,301
I was not, no.

00:19:25,301 --> 00:19:28,738
But you did redress him
and place him in the elevator.

00:19:28,738 --> 00:19:30,540
You don’t know what
you’re talking about.

00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,243
Well, that’s dangerous
to say to a scientist.

00:19:34,612 --> 00:19:38,817
Dandruff is nothing more than
sloughed-off skin.

00:19:38,817 --> 00:19:40,219
It has a nucleus

00:19:40,219 --> 00:19:43,956
just like a cell on your arm
or your big toe.

00:19:43,956 --> 00:19:47,227
These 13 DNA markers

00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,096
from this dandruff cell
are a match

00:19:49,096 --> 00:19:52,834
to the dandruff
that I recovered
from your sweater.

00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:54,903
You were there.

00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,705
At the hotel.

00:20:01,144 --> 00:20:03,513
Okay.

00:20:03,513 --> 00:20:05,583
Mr. Fairmont told me
earlier that day

00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,186
to meet him in his hotel room
at 9:00

00:20:08,186 --> 00:20:10,221
to pick up some papers, okay?

00:20:10,221 --> 00:20:12,424
When I got there,
he was in bed--

00:20:12,424 --> 00:20:14,593
<i>naked, unconscious.</i>

00:20:14,593 --> 00:20:16,696
<i>He always told me</i>
<i>reputation before health--</i>

00:20:16,696 --> 00:20:19,599
<i>no scandals.</i>

00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,302
I dragged him to the elevator.

00:20:28,744 --> 00:20:30,112
Let me guess--

00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:32,315
you snuck out down
the stairwell.

00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:35,919
Who was Fairmont partying with
in that room?

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,421
I don’t know.

00:20:37,421 --> 00:20:40,958
Well, we won’t mind
if we compare your DNA

00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,728
to the vaginal
contribution
of a condom

00:20:42,728 --> 00:20:44,897
that we recovered from
Mr. Fairmont’s room?

00:20:44,897 --> 00:20:46,599
Sure, go ahead.
Good.

00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:49,168
We’d like to show you
something else--

00:20:49,168 --> 00:20:51,205
about that
accidental shooting

00:20:51,205 --> 00:20:54,542
three years ago
at your boss’ house.

00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:56,377
WARRICK:
In this reenactment

00:20:56,377 --> 00:20:59,448
Fairmont shot himself
while cleaning his gun.

00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,652
The story
just doesn’t add up.

00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:05,755
I think I fell for it
because I was new

00:21:05,755 --> 00:21:07,791
and I wasn’t too eager
to talk to another guy

00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,328
about him almost shooting off
his manhood.

00:21:12,196 --> 00:21:14,566
This is the room
as it was then

00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:17,102
based off of
my crime scene photos.

00:21:17,102 --> 00:21:21,374
This is crime scene
reconstruction, new school.

00:21:21,374 --> 00:21:23,844
Works backward, reverse time.

00:21:23,844 --> 00:21:25,647
The bullet hit here.

00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:29,251
The only logical place

00:21:29,251 --> 00:21:30,853
for that bullet

00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:32,288
to have been shot from

00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:35,792
is four meters away,
one meter high.

00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:39,263
He didn’t
accidentally shoot himself.

00:21:39,263 --> 00:21:40,397
Someone shot him.

00:21:40,397 --> 00:21:41,832
We’re thinking it was you.

00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:46,572
The admission form
from the ER, 9/6/98.

00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:48,640
The person who
brought Fairmont in

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,943
on the accidental
shooting...

00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:53,881
was you.

00:21:53,881 --> 00:21:56,217
I didn’t shoot him.

00:21:56,217 --> 00:21:57,651
You didn’t poison him, either.

00:21:57,651 --> 00:21:59,488
All these bad things
just happen to you.

00:21:59,488 --> 00:22:02,391
I’m on call
24 hours a day, okay?

00:22:02,391 --> 00:22:04,359
Mr. Fairmont beeped me.

00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:06,796
I drove out to the house,
and I took him in.

00:22:06,796 --> 00:22:08,331
Where was his wife?

00:22:11,635 --> 00:22:14,772
You’d have to ask her.

00:22:14,772 --> 00:22:15,907
Yes, I shot him.

00:22:15,907 --> 00:22:17,876
He was supposed to go riding
with me

00:22:17,876 --> 00:22:20,813
and he didn’t show up
until 2:00 in the morning.

00:22:20,813 --> 00:22:22,248
No calls, nothing.

00:22:22,248 --> 00:22:25,885
I was... hurt.

00:22:25,885 --> 00:22:29,189
So, you just sat
there in the dark

00:22:29,189 --> 00:22:31,192
<i>and aimed south of his belt.</i>

00:22:31,192 --> 00:22:33,261
I just wanted to scare him.

00:22:33,261 --> 00:22:35,231
It was a business meeting.

00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:36,398
I swear.

00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:38,468
I-It wasn’t like before.

00:22:38,468 --> 00:22:41,538
I was thinking about you
the whole time.

00:22:41,538 --> 00:22:43,474
So, why didn’t you
tell the truth then?

00:22:43,474 --> 00:22:46,377
I wanted to,
but Bob wouldn’t let me.

00:22:46,377 --> 00:22:48,380
He said that
it would ruin his career--

00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,882
Fairmont Family Estates.

00:22:49,882 --> 00:22:51,651
WARRICK:
I’m presenting
this case

00:22:51,651 --> 00:22:54,220
to the D.A., even if
it is three years old.

00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,989
My husband’s dead.

00:22:55,989 --> 00:22:57,491
We had our problems

00:22:57,491 --> 00:22:59,894
but I loved him.

00:22:59,894 --> 00:23:02,530
I don’t... I don’t much care
what you do now.

00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,666
Well, there’s only two reasons
a woman shoots a man.

00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,168
She either loves him
or hates him.

00:23:06,168 --> 00:23:07,770
Or both.

00:23:11,741 --> 00:23:13,377
And that’s the sample
Catherine pulled off

00:23:13,377 --> 00:23:15,980
of the secretary’s blouse
and the hotel man’s clothes--

00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,014
same source.

00:23:17,014 --> 00:23:18,516
Secretary moved the body.

00:23:18,516 --> 00:23:20,051
We just interviewed her.

00:23:20,051 --> 00:23:21,520
She copped
to moving him.

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,655
We’re looking hard
at the wife on the poisoning.

00:23:23,655 --> 00:23:26,293
The secretary
has dandruff.

00:23:26,293 --> 00:23:27,694
We know.

00:23:27,694 --> 00:23:30,298
Dermatomycoses seborrhea--
we got it.

00:23:30,298 --> 00:23:33,635
Topical eczemas
like that require
prescription medication.

00:23:33,635 --> 00:23:36,238
The primary ingredient
of those medications--

00:23:36,238 --> 00:23:38,340
selenium sulfide.

00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,843
JULIA:
<i>I don’t really feel right</i>

00:23:40,843 --> 00:23:41,644
about doing this.

00:23:41,644 --> 00:23:43,113
Oh, this is
your residence.

00:23:43,113 --> 00:23:45,582
Everything in Claudia’s
office is your property.

00:23:45,582 --> 00:23:47,852
She could be back
from dinner at any moment.

00:23:47,852 --> 00:23:49,887
This shouldn’t
take long.

00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,556
( <i>door closes</i> )

00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:27,367
( <i>door opens</i> )

00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:29,635
That’s mine.

00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,805
BRASS:
Could you tell us

00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:34,141
why you keep your shampoo
in your office?

00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:35,943
WILLOWS:
Shampoo full of
the same poison

00:24:35,943 --> 00:24:38,146
found in Bob Fairmont’s remains?

00:24:38,146 --> 00:24:39,481
I don’t know.

00:24:39,481 --> 00:24:41,650
Aw, you have to do
better than that.

00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,052
CLAUDIA:
Maybe I picked it up

00:24:43,052 --> 00:24:45,188
at the pharmacy on lunch
and put it there.

00:24:45,188 --> 00:24:46,122
I don’t know.

00:24:56,902 --> 00:24:59,038
Cream cheese.

00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:01,208
( <i>Claudia scoffs</i> )

00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,642
<i>Garlic</i> cream cheese.

00:25:02,642 --> 00:25:04,578
Hides the bitter aftertaste.

00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:15,591
It explains away
his bad breath.

00:25:15,591 --> 00:25:17,694
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:25:17,694 --> 00:25:18,862
I did not poison him.

00:25:18,862 --> 00:25:20,397
( <i>cabinet door closes</i> )

00:25:20,397 --> 00:25:21,866
We’ll see.

00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,237
Aren’t you going to arrest her?

00:25:25,237 --> 00:25:26,238
( <i>scoffs</i> )

00:25:26,238 --> 00:25:27,673
I haven’t done anything.

00:25:27,673 --> 00:25:29,375
Other than poison Bob.

00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:30,609
Poison?

00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:32,546
I’m the one who looked out
for him.

00:25:32,546 --> 00:25:33,747
You? I ran his home.

00:25:33,747 --> 00:25:35,482
I entertained his clients.

00:25:35,482 --> 00:25:37,752
Who made all of his
dental appointments, huh?

00:25:37,752 --> 00:25:40,655
His haircuts? Who got
his taxes in on time?

00:25:40,655 --> 00:25:41,923
Covered for his mistresses.

00:25:41,923 --> 00:25:45,261
Oh...
why did he need mistresses?

00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:46,362
BRASS:
Ladies...

00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:47,497
don’t go there.

00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,769
This is yours...

00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:52,836
and these are yours.

00:25:52,836 --> 00:25:54,205
There’s the door.

00:25:54,205 --> 00:25:57,409
We build a case
before we make any arrests.

00:25:57,409 --> 00:25:59,544
( <i>monitor beeping rhythmically</i> )

00:26:01,481 --> 00:26:02,648
Hey, Mr. Mercer.

00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:04,350
I got your message.

00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,186
You wanted to talk to me?

00:26:06,186 --> 00:26:09,123
Did you find out
who poisoned Mr. Fairmont?

00:26:09,123 --> 00:26:10,257
No.

00:26:10,257 --> 00:26:12,560
No, sir. I have found
selenium in his office

00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,565
but... without actually
knowing how much was
in his system...

00:26:16,565 --> 00:26:19,435
What if I could tell you?

00:26:19,435 --> 00:26:21,037
My body’s rejecting the organ.

00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,774
Doctor says it’s got
nothing to do with poison.

00:26:23,774 --> 00:26:24,975
It’s antibodies.

00:26:24,975 --> 00:26:27,012
( <i>sniffles</i> )

00:26:27,012 --> 00:26:28,647
I’m sorry.

00:26:28,647 --> 00:26:31,550
I told you this watch stopped
while I was

00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,085
down in surgery?

00:26:33,085 --> 00:26:35,322
It’s funny...

00:26:35,322 --> 00:26:39,727
it’s like it knew all along
the kidney wasn’t going to take.

00:26:39,727 --> 00:26:43,998
Anyway... there’s
one last good thing I can do

00:26:43,998 --> 00:26:46,468
before I leave this earth.

00:26:46,468 --> 00:26:49,905
So... how do we do this?

00:26:54,511 --> 00:26:55,679
I can’t even talk Warrick

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,081
into splitting a sandwich
with me

00:26:57,081 --> 00:26:59,116
and this guy’s willing
to give us his kidney?

00:26:59,116 --> 00:27:00,285
You asked for it.

00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,920
Yeah, that’s my point.

00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,724
Carl Mercer risks
dying sooner to help
our investigation

00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,727
but who protects
his rights?

00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:10,197
He has free will.

00:27:10,197 --> 00:27:11,331
Well, so do I.

00:27:11,331 --> 00:27:13,000
I want to retract
our request.

00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,870
I don’t think
any investigation
for the dead

00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,672
is worth hurting
the living.

00:27:20,943 --> 00:27:22,178
What?

00:27:22,178 --> 00:27:23,513
SIDLE:
Guys?

00:27:23,513 --> 00:27:25,215
You’re not going
to believe this.

00:27:25,215 --> 00:27:26,249
<i>Funny.</i>

00:27:26,249 --> 00:27:27,818
Sometimes it is
the simplest things

00:27:27,818 --> 00:27:29,053
that seem so difficult.

00:27:29,053 --> 00:27:30,722
I’ve been trying
to match the partial

00:27:30,722 --> 00:27:32,791
from the champagne bottle
to these known prints.

00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:34,894
It was upside down.

00:27:36,228 --> 00:27:37,730
( <i>computer beeps</i> )

00:27:41,302 --> 00:27:42,769
Must’ve grabbed

00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:47,042

<i>upside-down to pour.</i>

( <i>computer beeps twice</i> )

00:27:58,422 --> 00:28:00,124
So...

00:28:00,124 --> 00:28:01,526
who was he with?

00:28:01,526 --> 00:28:03,595
Mrs. Fairmont.

00:28:03,595 --> 00:28:05,096
What?
Player was in the hotel

00:28:05,096 --> 00:28:07,867
cheating with his own wife?

00:28:07,867 --> 00:28:11,638
I was trying to...
rekindle our marriage.

00:28:11,638 --> 00:28:15,509
I... got the room...
brought the champagne.

00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:17,245
Oh, yes.

00:28:17,245 --> 00:28:18,647
Yes.

00:28:18,647 --> 00:28:19,981
He squeezed me
in between

00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:21,851
business meetings
at the hotel.

00:28:21,851 --> 00:28:23,919
And you didn’t think
to tell me that

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,321
when we first talked?

00:28:25,321 --> 00:28:26,957
No, because you asked me

00:28:26,957 --> 00:28:29,927
about him being redressed
in an elevator...

00:28:29,927 --> 00:28:33,798
and, besides, when I left him,
he was... alive

00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:35,801
watching the news.

00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:37,936
( <i>television news playing</i> )

00:28:42,108 --> 00:28:45,312
Oh, so, he had a stroke
alone, after you left.

00:28:45,312 --> 00:28:48,283
( <i>groaning</i> )

00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,819
I’m not a doctor.

00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:52,254
I don’t know when he had it.

00:28:52,254 --> 00:28:53,855
BRASS:
Well, CSI is testing

00:28:53,855 --> 00:28:55,858
that champagne bottle
for selenium.

00:28:55,858 --> 00:28:58,829
I didn’t think
poison caused strokes.

00:28:58,829 --> 00:29:01,332
You seem to know
a lot about poison

00:29:01,332 --> 00:29:02,967
for not being a doctor.

00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:07,005
I know a lot of things
about a lot of things

00:29:07,005 --> 00:29:09,942
but that doesn’t mean
that I killed my husband.

00:29:12,612 --> 00:29:16,283
Yeah... but
what never lies?

00:29:18,753 --> 00:29:20,955
Fairmont had
three gold crowns.

00:29:20,955 --> 00:29:23,759
They should’ve survived
the cremation.

00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:27,897
At least partially.
Heavy metal, after all.

00:29:27,897 --> 00:29:30,700
SIDLE:
His wife...

00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,302
had them removed
at the mortuary.

00:29:32,302 --> 00:29:35,140
That adds new meaning
to the phrase "gold digger."

00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,508
Actually, that’s how
the phrase got started.

00:29:37,508 --> 00:29:40,712
People used to dig up the
bodies to extract the gold.

00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:41,914
Now they just marry them.

00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:43,883
In some countries,
this would be enough

00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:46,186
to have her arrested
for murdering her husband.

00:29:46,186 --> 00:29:48,356
What’s the most
important component

00:29:48,356 --> 00:29:50,391
in a poisoning?

00:29:50,391 --> 00:29:53,194
Poison.

00:29:53,194 --> 00:29:54,997
Patience.

Yeah, yeah, let’s sit down

00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:54,135
Hey, what’s going on?

00:30:54,135 --> 00:30:55,870
We called the hospital.

00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,072
She’s been released.

00:30:57,072 --> 00:30:59,107
ER doc gave her a shot
of Hydropazeen...

00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,409
sent her on her way.

00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:01,477
Hydropazeen?

00:31:01,477 --> 00:31:02,946
That’s an antiemetic

00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:06,416
used to counteract
heavy metal poisoning.

00:31:06,416 --> 00:31:10,788
Which means... somebody’s
been poisoning our suspect.

00:31:10,788 --> 00:31:13,224
I don’t know
how it happened.

00:31:13,224 --> 00:31:15,794
Maybe she poisoned herself.

00:31:15,794 --> 00:31:17,564
Why would she do that?

00:31:17,564 --> 00:31:20,567
Why would she hide my
shampoo in my office?

00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:21,802
What, you know she did that?

00:31:21,802 --> 00:31:22,936
Well, it wasn’t her husband.

00:31:22,936 --> 00:31:24,272
He was already dead.

00:31:24,272 --> 00:31:26,040
She’s trying to frame me
for killing him.

00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,341
I mean,
do you have anything

00:31:27,341 --> 00:31:29,311
beyond your suspicions
that she did kill him?

00:31:29,311 --> 00:31:31,981
She had
his gold fillings removed.

00:31:31,981 --> 00:31:34,517
Doesn’t that tell you something
about her?

00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,555
I had his watch
and ring removed, too.

00:31:38,555 --> 00:31:40,124
Do you want to see them?

00:31:40,124 --> 00:31:41,959
They’re in a box at home.

00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:44,062
You realize that
doesn’t look good?

00:31:44,062 --> 00:31:45,864
It can look
however it wants.

00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:47,233
I have nothing to hide.

00:31:47,233 --> 00:31:49,368
You mean since
you yourself have
been poisoned?

00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:51,671
Yeah, why aren’t you asking
Claudia Richards about that?

00:31:51,671 --> 00:31:53,107
First my husband, then me?

00:31:53,107 --> 00:31:55,576
Why would she want
to kill either one of you?

00:31:55,576 --> 00:31:57,478
I don’t know.

00:31:59,347 --> 00:32:02,118
Maybe because he refused...

00:32:02,118 --> 00:32:05,522
to leave me for her.

00:32:05,522 --> 00:32:08,325
I had to wash his grungy
coffee mug every night.

00:32:08,325 --> 00:32:11,529
I had to clean his toenail
clippings off of his desktop.

00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,766
Why would I ever ask Bob
Fairmont to leave anyone for me?

00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,102
So, you think it was all
in Mrs. Fairmont’s head?

00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:20,440
He always said
she was crazy.

00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,108
Okay, that’s it. All right...

00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:23,509
Look, we’re not leaving here

00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:25,346
till we get
to the bottom of this.

00:32:25,346 --> 00:32:28,315
Then I hope she talks soon.

Hey.

00:32:42,132 --> 00:32:44,702
I was just printing
something out for you

00:32:44,702 --> 00:32:46,705
on your hot case.

00:32:46,705 --> 00:32:48,340
From the Internet?

00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,276
SANDERS:
Yeah, I...

00:32:50,276 --> 00:32:52,812
I was... on break,
had some time...

00:32:52,812 --> 00:32:54,714
thought, hey...

00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,787
Sorry, I drew
a blank on the wife.

00:32:59,787 --> 00:33:04,059
I could really, really
just kiss you right now.

00:33:13,304 --> 00:33:15,707
GRISSOM:
So, this is Claudia.

00:33:15,707 --> 00:33:20,145
SIDLE:
Ten years ago, her husband,
John Gideon.

00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,919
Claudia’s rich husband

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,654
also died young-- 35.

00:33:27,654 --> 00:33:32,093
She donated his organs
and cremated his body.

00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,762
We don’t have to chase
down these organs.

00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:36,898
Ralph Parks rejected
the organ that he got

00:33:36,898 --> 00:33:38,067
from Claudia’s husband.

00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:39,836
An organ with a memory,
maybe?

00:33:39,836 --> 00:33:41,938
The most. Liver.

00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:44,775
He died two months
after receiving it

00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:45,943
back in ’93.

00:33:45,943 --> 00:33:48,312
Lived one state over
in Arizona.

00:33:48,312 --> 00:33:50,515
I have the cemetery address.

00:33:50,515 --> 00:33:52,451
Hey, Sara,
got the warrant.

00:33:52,451 --> 00:33:53,919
Awesome.

00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,755
We’ll keep you posted.

00:34:17,515 --> 00:34:21,119
Embalming certainly retards
the decomposition process.

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,322
Yeah, well, it doesn’t
stop the smell.

00:34:23,322 --> 00:34:25,958
The liver’s degraded

00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:27,827
but any metal should
still be there.

00:34:29,729 --> 00:34:31,464
We’ll find out.

00:35:15,385 --> 00:35:17,654
Nick, did you get anything?

00:35:17,654 --> 00:35:18,522
Hey, Sara. Yeah.

00:35:18,522 --> 00:35:21,625
Sodium selenite--selenium.

00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:25,130
280 milligrams
for a 180-pound man...

00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,832
That’s murder.

00:35:26,832 --> 00:35:29,335
Yeah, well, it would have been
murder for a 300-pound man.

00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,704
This is different
than the shampoo compound.

00:35:31,704 --> 00:35:35,008
Yeah, it contains
polysorbate 80
and vitamin E.

00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,343
That combination’s found

00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,580
in selenium supplements
injected in animals.

00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,616
Animals? Like cats, dogs?

00:35:41,616 --> 00:35:44,120
Mostly livestock, grazers.

00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,454
To make up for the lack

00:35:45,454 --> 00:35:47,624
of selenium nutrient
in the soil.

00:35:47,624 --> 00:35:50,627
How did Claudia get
access to this stuff?

00:35:50,627 --> 00:35:53,264
A dairy farm.

00:35:53,264 --> 00:35:56,768

00:35:56,768 --> 00:35:59,538
Largest supplier of milk
in Connecticut, in fact.

chamber-of-commerce type

00:36:04,411 --> 00:36:05,913

00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:08,749
You want to know
who his secretary was?

Ten years ago,
you played secretary

00:36:23,768 --> 00:36:27,305
and you played wife
to John Gideon.

00:36:27,305 --> 00:36:28,774
We have never represented

00:36:28,774 --> 00:36:32,145
we didn’t know
each other previously.

00:36:32,145 --> 00:36:34,313
JULIA:
And I wasn’t playing.

00:36:34,313 --> 00:36:37,217
I was
a hard-working secretary.

00:36:37,217 --> 00:36:38,552
And you loved
your husband

00:36:38,552 --> 00:36:41,689
right up to the day he died...

00:36:41,689 --> 00:36:44,626
of 240 milligrams
of selenium.

00:36:44,626 --> 00:36:47,663
Animal selenium,
the kind used for cattle.

00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,432
Well, we did live
in grazing country.

00:36:49,432 --> 00:36:51,301
Although, I have to say,
Julia knew more

00:36:51,301 --> 00:36:53,036
about livestock
than I did.

00:36:53,036 --> 00:36:54,738
She rode horses.

00:36:54,738 --> 00:36:57,909
I took the job because
Mr. G let me board my horse

00:36:57,909 --> 00:36:59,444
at the family stables.

00:36:59,444 --> 00:37:01,781
CLAUDIA:
Oh, I hated the stables.

00:37:01,781 --> 00:37:03,783
The smell.
Never stepped foot in them.

Bravo. ladies.

You have got this down
to a science.

00:37:16,965 --> 00:37:18,467
Why did it happen

00:37:18,467 --> 00:37:20,269

00:37:20,269 --> 00:37:23,240
Hubby ignored you
or abused you

00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,209
or you got sick of him
fooling around

00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:26,777
so you started slipping

<i>the cow stuff</i>
<i>into his chocolate milk?</i>

00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:38,191

I’m coming into a lot of money.

No, we are.

And then what?

00:37:58,315 --> 00:37:59,751
The two of you realized

00:37:59,751 --> 00:38:02,020
how quickly you could run
through a couple million?

00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,521
So you went looking

00:38:03,521 --> 00:38:05,691
for another mark
here in Nevada?

00:38:05,691 --> 00:38:07,393
But the difference is

00:38:07,393 --> 00:38:10,063
that you actually
loved Bob Fairmont.

00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,270
You shot him because
he was cheating

00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,673
but that didn’t get in the way

00:38:17,673 --> 00:38:22,278

00:38:57,621 --> 00:38:59,757
Where’s the ladies’ room?

00:38:59,757 --> 00:39:03,027
It’s down the hall
to your right.

00:39:03,027 --> 00:39:04,863
Thanks.

00:39:06,865 --> 00:39:08,400
Pardon me.

00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,338
WILLOWS:
Well, no big surprise.

00:39:11,338 --> 00:39:13,140
We have proof of poison

00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,643
but no way to prove
which one of them did it.

00:39:15,643 --> 00:39:17,378
I like either one of them
for the murder--

00:39:17,378 --> 00:39:18,947
so will a jury.

00:39:18,947 --> 00:39:21,082
She-said/she-said defense?
It’s never going to fly.

00:39:21,082 --> 00:39:22,918
They’ll raise each other
as a viable suspect

00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:24,520
just like they did with us.

00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,489
That’s what the D.A. said
verbatim.

00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,624
See you back at CSI.

00:39:28,624 --> 00:39:29,793
Wait. What?

00:39:29,793 --> 00:39:31,862
So, what,
and just let them move on

00:39:31,862 --> 00:39:33,731
to another state,
another husband?

00:39:33,731 --> 00:39:35,667
It’s not always up to us.

00:39:45,845 --> 00:39:49,249
( <i>distant siren wailing</i> )

00:39:49,249 --> 00:39:52,387
Sara...

00:39:52,387 --> 00:39:53,789
look...

00:39:53,789 --> 00:39:56,993
I know this isn’t
news to you

00:39:56,993 --> 00:39:59,529
but sometimes
science isn’t enough.

00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:02,332
What are we doing?

00:40:02,332 --> 00:40:05,937
Digging up graves,
chasing prints--

00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:09,174
if it’s no good in court...

00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:11,410
if the killers win...

00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,279
It isn’t a competition.

00:40:13,279 --> 00:40:14,380
We don’t win.

00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,250
The courts are
like dice.

00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,652
They have no memory.

00:40:18,652 --> 00:40:20,221
What works one week

00:40:20,221 --> 00:40:20,939
doesn’t work
the next.

00:40:20,939 --> 00:40:22,673
I know that. I do.

00:40:22,673 --> 00:40:25,206
I know that.

00:40:25,206 --> 00:40:26,706
That’s why I’m mad.

00:40:26,706 --> 00:40:30,106
But, see, if you get mad,
then they <i>do</i> win.

00:40:30,106 --> 00:40:31,673
You just said...

00:40:35,773 --> 00:40:38,673
This is one of your riddles,
isn’t it?

00:40:38,673 --> 00:40:41,173
One of life’s riddles...

00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:44,739
but, hey...

00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:46,473
the good news--

00:40:46,473 --> 00:40:49,439
there’s no statute of limitation
on murder.
