Vic's Ruth Elliot,

Animal Control's

To us, smelly.

To a female cat,

You don't look so good.

Oh, bummer.

She's been dead

And who would have access?

Just me... and my husband.

But Johnny had nothing
to do with this.

You know, house cats have

didn't kill her.

00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:34,268
Kind of like when Mommy's
boyfriend is late for dinner.

00:11:34,335 --> 00:11:35,736
She hates that.

00:11:36,838 --> 00:11:39,040
GRISSOM:
And, uh...

00:11:39,106 --> 00:11:40,875
who is Mrs. Stein?

00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:43,711
Mrs. Elliot's
next-door neighbor.

00:11:43,778 --> 00:11:45,146
Ran a background check.

00:11:45,213 --> 00:11:46,848
The good neighbor filed

00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,817
three nuisance complaints
against the victim.

00:11:51,352 --> 00:11:53,387
Hey, are you girls
sharing secrets?

00:11:53,454 --> 00:11:54,655
Can you share it with me?

00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,391
All right.

00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,798
Thank you.

00:12:03,865 --> 00:12:05,199
No problem.

00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:10,238
I think
that we're done here.

00:12:10,304 --> 00:12:12,240
Okay. Thanks
for your help.

00:12:12,306 --> 00:12:13,941
Sure.

00:12:16,077 --> 00:12:17,311
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:12:17,378 --> 00:12:19,280
I'll get a warrant for
Mrs. Stein's shoes.

00:12:19,347 --> 00:12:21,349
See if we can
place her at
the crime scene.

00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,085
Don't you have
a secret

00:12:24,152 --> 00:12:25,386
to share
with me now?

00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,156
Oh, uh,
Mrs. Stein?

00:12:28,222 --> 00:12:30,725
She hates cats.

00:12:51,016 --> 00:12:52,885
Another spring.

00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:54,954
Did you know
there's a dozen moving parts

00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,155
inside a ticking clock?

00:12:56,222 --> 00:12:58,124
I do now.

00:13:00,393 --> 00:13:01,694
Hmm...

00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:03,129
Hello, sweetheart.

00:13:03,195 --> 00:13:04,130
End cap?

00:13:04,196 --> 00:13:06,565
Pipe bomb.

00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:08,434
End cap at both ends.

00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:10,536
Either one could have come
in contact

00:13:10,603 --> 00:13:12,571
with the explosive
inside the pipe.

00:13:12,638 --> 00:13:14,440
I'll swab it

00:13:14,507 --> 00:13:17,343
see if Trace
can identify it.

00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,178
I will see your end cap

00:13:19,245 --> 00:13:20,679
and raise you a grommet.

00:13:20,746 --> 00:13:24,016
A grommet?
Inside a pipe bomb?

00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,419
Not in the bomb, itself,
but embedded in the end cap.

00:13:26,485 --> 00:13:27,853
The wires from
the timing device

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,922
enter the pipe through
a hole in the grommet.

00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:31,957
<i>When the timing device</i>
<i>is activated, it sets off</i>

00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:34,427
<i>an electrical charge that</i>
<i>detonates the explosives</i>

00:13:34,493 --> 00:13:35,428
<i>inside the pipe.</i>

00:13:35,494 --> 00:13:37,329
Yet the grommet's fully intact.

00:13:37,396 --> 00:13:39,165
How did it survive the blast?

00:13:39,231 --> 00:13:40,933
I don't know, but
they always do.

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,135
And just when I thought
you knew everything.

00:13:43,202 --> 00:13:44,603
BRASS:
How's the puzzle?

00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,039
Hey. Pieces are small,
but it's coming together.

00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:48,407
Well, I got a
corner piece.

00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:50,276
The 4-1-1 on Marcie
Tobin's husband?

00:13:50,342 --> 00:13:52,178
Junior foreman

00:13:52,244 --> 00:13:54,046
on Tobin C &amp;amp; D,
Incorporated.

00:13:54,113 --> 00:13:56,315
The "C" stands for
"construction"

00:13:56,382 --> 00:13:59,285
the "D" is
for "demolition."

00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:01,554
MAN:
I got to do my job,
you got to do your job.

00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,689
So, if this stuff
isn't taken down there

00:14:03,756 --> 00:14:05,124
then we all lose.

00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:06,258
So, you just make sure

00:14:06,325 --> 00:14:07,860
that you are in touch
with me...

00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:08,961
Jonathan Claddon?

00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:10,096
Yeah.

00:14:10,162 --> 00:14:11,997
I'm Nick Stokes.
This is Sara Sidle.

00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:13,666
We're with
the Vegas Crime Lab.

00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:15,067
We're here about
your wife's car.

00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:16,635
Yeah, she told me
you might stop by.

00:14:16,702 --> 00:14:19,171
Mr. Claddon are you
a demolitions expert?

00:14:19,238 --> 00:14:20,339
That's what we do.

00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:22,308
You must have seen
our work on TV.

00:14:22,374 --> 00:14:24,744
We imploded most
of the old Strip hotels.

00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,480
Do you personally know
how to make a bomb?

00:14:27,546 --> 00:14:28,614
It's not hard.

00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:30,983
Anybody here
could show you how.

00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:31,884
STOKES:
So, I take that

00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:32,885
as a "yes"?

00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:34,253
If you're implying

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,689
I had anything
to do with all of this...

00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:38,157
I love my wife.

00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:41,527
Not enough, apparently,
to be there for her last night.

00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:44,196
Johnny, Reynolds needs
help loading the truck.

00:14:44,263 --> 00:14:45,798
These folks are
from the Crime Lab.

00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:47,066
They're here about Marcie.

00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:48,801
I'd like to talk to them.

00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:51,303
Alone.

00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,539
Well, let me know
if I can help.

00:14:53,606 --> 00:14:54,874
Will do.

00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,008
MAN:
Oh.

00:14:56,075 --> 00:14:57,209
Barclay Tobin.

00:14:57,276 --> 00:14:58,611
This is my company.

00:14:58,677 --> 00:15:00,079
Any leads on my daughter's case?

00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:02,248
At this point, we're
still asking questions.

00:15:02,314 --> 00:15:04,617
Can you tell us about
your son-in-law?

00:15:04,683 --> 00:15:07,353
Well, I got him
his first and only job
when he married Marcie.

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,121
STOKES:
You, uh...
you don't think

00:15:09,188 --> 00:15:10,423
too much of him, huh?

00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:11,624
Even less these days.

00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,759
Marcie says
that he's cheating on her

00:15:13,826 --> 00:15:16,562
but I don't think
he has the stones.

00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:18,798
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:20,132
But after last night...

00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:22,468
Does Johnny have access
to explosives?

00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:24,970
All my foremen have access
to dynamite.

00:15:27,706 --> 00:15:29,642
Mr. Tobin, do
you fingerprint
your employees?

00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:30,876
Sure do.

00:15:30,943 --> 00:15:33,379
It's standard
for the industry.

00:15:33,446 --> 00:15:35,981
Just let me know
what you need.

00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,285
Before you ask

00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:42,621
that swab of yours,
from the end cap...

00:15:42,688 --> 00:15:45,291
let's play
"Name That Chemical Compound."

00:15:45,357 --> 00:15:47,126
Today's category:
"Explosives."

00:15:47,193 --> 00:15:48,594
30 seconds on the clock.

00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:49,695
Get...

00:15:49,762 --> 00:15:52,031
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:57,269
C-3...

00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:01,674
H-5...

00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:06,245
and three molecules of NO-3...

00:16:06,312 --> 00:16:07,747
Nitroglycerin.

00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:09,348
The explosive
component

00:16:09,415 --> 00:16:10,750
of dynamite.

00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:13,185
Now, the other component
for dynamite

00:16:13,252 --> 00:16:15,121
is either silica or sawdust.

00:16:15,187 --> 00:16:17,123
Your sample contains sawdust.

00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:18,824
Thanks, Greg.

00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:20,559
What'd I win?

00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:22,555
Hey.

00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:23,522
Hey.

00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,890
Well, you look...

00:17:24,957 --> 00:17:25,825
Happy?

00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:27,159
Smug, actually.

00:17:27,226 --> 00:17:29,061
I got a perfect print

00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:30,830
off the end cap.

00:17:30,896 --> 00:17:32,164
Husband.

00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:33,733
Nice.

00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:37,369
I got the type
of explosive used
in the pipe bomb.

00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:39,605
Dynamite--
nitro and sawdust.

00:17:39,672 --> 00:17:42,241
The same kind used
at Tobin C &amp; D.

00:17:42,308 --> 00:17:43,409
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:44,410
Mm-hmm...

00:17:44,477 --> 00:17:46,078
You found the end cap?

00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:47,313
That's not easy.

00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,281
Hey, if I were you

00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:51,517
I'd worry about
my fingerprint.

00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:53,386
How'd it get there?

00:17:53,452 --> 00:17:54,787
My father-in-law's
company is

00:17:54,854 --> 00:17:56,789
the largest purchaser
of end caps in Nevada.

00:17:56,856 --> 00:17:58,057
I log inventory.

00:17:58,124 --> 00:17:59,692
BRASS:
Well, speaking
of inventory

00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:00,893
I checked the books.

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,094
As you know,
per the ATF

00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:04,029
every stick of dynamite
is catalogued.

00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:05,464
You logged-out
a case of 24.

00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:08,300
When the demolition project
was postponed

00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:10,770
you returned the case...

00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:12,438
one stick short.

00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:14,940
It was stolen.

00:18:15,007 --> 00:18:16,942
Look, I'm the one who
reported the theft.

00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:21,647
I kept the dynamite in my SUV,
inside a storage magazine.

00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:24,750
So, you're telling us
someone broke into your vehicle

00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:26,919
and stole a single stick
of dynamite?

00:18:26,986 --> 00:18:29,288
Yes.

00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,591
Tell us about
your girlfriend.

00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:36,529
Is that what Mr.
Tobin told you?

00:18:38,297 --> 00:18:41,767
Marcie's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:43,202
Plus, I've got an ulcer.

00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:45,738
Do you have any idea
what an affair would do to me?

00:18:45,805 --> 00:18:48,374
I work my butt off
for her old man.

00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:50,943
I barely have enough
time to sleep

00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,945
let alone Romeo
some other girl.

00:18:53,012 --> 00:18:56,215
And the truth is, nothing
I ever do is good enough.

00:18:56,282 --> 00:18:59,018
Tobin wouldn't even
let Marcie take my name.

00:18:59,085 --> 00:19:00,986
Cry me a river, Johnny.

00:19:02,855 --> 00:19:04,457
You're looking at the wrong guy.

00:19:04,523 --> 00:19:06,859
Then point us
in the right direction.

00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:10,996
Marcie handles the payroll

00:19:11,063 --> 00:19:14,867
and she has a rep
for shortchanging overtime.

00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:17,536
Talk about pissing
people off.

00:19:17,603 --> 00:19:20,840
Any one of those guys could have
put that bomb in her car.

00:19:20,906 --> 00:19:23,008
Why didn't you tell us
this before?

00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:24,677
Because it's
not her fault.

00:19:24,744 --> 00:19:27,346
She's just doing what
her father tells her.

00:19:42,428 --> 00:19:44,430
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:19:45,564 --> 00:19:46,632
Debbie Stein?

00:19:46,699 --> 00:19:47,900
Yes.

00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:49,835
I'm here for your shoes.

00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:24,336
Phew.

00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:27,306
<i>Eau de</i> cat.

00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:43,089
<i>Eau de</i> match.

00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,034
She was a pig.

00:20:46,101 --> 00:20:47,169
Her house stunk.

00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:50,261
She didn't belong
in the neighborhood.

00:20:50,328 --> 00:20:53,164
So, I guess it's
safe to say you
weren't friends?

00:20:55,683 --> 00:20:57,952
Why were you in her house?

00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:00,225
I wanted to give her a chance
to find homes for her cats

00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,100
before I called
the Humane Society.

00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:04,349
To report her.

00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:05,808
By law, you can
only own three.

00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:08,777
Well, a witness heard
you scream at her.

00:21:08,844 --> 00:21:10,946
She was irrational.

00:21:11,013 --> 00:21:12,348
I was angry.

00:21:12,414 --> 00:21:13,983
This is disgusting.
Nobody lives like this.

00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:15,150
You've got to
get rid of them.

00:21:15,217 --> 00:21:16,719
These cats are my children,
and no one's

00:21:16,785 --> 00:21:18,020
going to take them away from me.

00:21:18,087 --> 00:21:19,989
Then you clean up after them.

00:21:20,055 --> 00:21:22,358
I can smell your house
from my kitchen.

00:21:22,424 --> 00:21:25,160
When, exactly, did you
confront Mrs. Elliot?

00:21:25,227 --> 00:21:27,229
I don't know.

00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:28,430
Maybe...

00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:30,466
six days ago.

00:21:30,532 --> 00:21:33,235
Before my trip
to L.A.

00:21:33,302 --> 00:21:35,404
I went to visit my sister.

00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:37,573
Look, if you have
any other questions

00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,142
I want a lawyer.

00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:42,378
You're free to go.

00:21:48,651 --> 00:21:50,619
Well, she had an answer
for everything.

00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:52,354
You know, according
to Mark Twain

00:21:52,421 --> 00:21:53,822
the most
striking difference

00:21:53,889 --> 00:21:56,759
between a cat and a lie is that
a cat only has <i>nine</i> lives.

00:21:56,825 --> 00:21:58,494
What are you saying?
That she's lying?

00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,797
Unless her alibi
checks out.

00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:22,718
Bomber fastened the cap
to the pipe

00:22:22,785 --> 00:22:24,186
leaving behind tool marks.

00:22:24,253 --> 00:22:26,655
Check it out.

00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:28,924
What kind of tool leaves

00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:31,794
evenly-spaced vertical
striations?

00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,562
A vice grip.

00:22:35,864 --> 00:22:36,799
A vice grip?

00:22:36,865 --> 00:22:38,500
Yeah.

00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:41,136
Let's get a warrant
for Johnny Claddon's home

00:22:41,203 --> 00:22:42,905
and for Tobin C &amp;amp; D.

00:22:47,977 --> 00:22:49,645
Hey, guys.

00:22:51,213 --> 00:22:52,147
WILLOWS:
Hey!

00:22:52,214 --> 00:22:53,349
Talked with O'Riley.

00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,117
The neighbor's alibi
<i>does</i> check out.

00:22:55,184 --> 00:22:56,585
She was at her sister's
in L.A.

00:22:56,652 --> 00:22:57,987
during the time
of the murder.

00:22:58,053 --> 00:22:59,622
Well, there goes
our only suspect.

00:22:59,688 --> 00:23:00,789
Not so fast.

00:23:00,856 --> 00:23:02,157
I got another one.

00:23:02,224 --> 00:23:04,259
We have a match
on that print

00:23:04,326 --> 00:23:06,562
that we found
on the wall safe.

00:23:06,629 --> 00:23:07,963
Right!

00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,431
Yeah.

00:23:09,498 --> 00:23:11,000
He has a non-gaming work card.

00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:12,167
He's 45 years old.

00:23:12,234 --> 00:23:13,902
He was an electrician
at the Tangiers

00:23:13,969 --> 00:23:15,671
from '97 to '99.

00:23:15,738 --> 00:23:17,606
His name is Tyler Elliot.

00:23:17,673 --> 00:23:18,974
That's the same last name

00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,643
as the vic.
Victim's son.

00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:22,077
Only child.

00:23:22,144 --> 00:23:24,280
MAN:
<i>I wasn't skipping town.</i>

00:23:24,346 --> 00:23:25,648
O'RILEY:
That why you had

00:23:25,714 --> 00:23:27,349
a duffel bag in
the back seat?

00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:30,085
I was going camping
out at Red Rock.

00:23:30,152 --> 00:23:32,521
And suddenly, these
cops pull me over.

00:23:32,588 --> 00:23:34,189
They take me
into custody.

00:23:34,256 --> 00:23:35,991
My car's still up there.

00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:39,728
Your mother died,
and you never claimed the body.

00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:40,963
How come?

00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,265
Funerals are expensive.

00:23:43,332 --> 00:23:44,500
I'm broke.

00:23:44,566 --> 00:23:46,702
O'RILEY:
Records show
he filed

00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:48,337
for bankruptcy
last month.

00:23:48,404 --> 00:23:51,006
I figured let
the county pick
up the tab.

00:23:51,073 --> 00:23:54,209
No one was going
to show up anyway.

00:23:58,781 --> 00:24:00,516
It's not like
we were close.

00:24:00,582 --> 00:24:02,885
So, how often
<i>did</i> you see her?

00:24:02,952 --> 00:24:04,720
Twice a month.

00:24:04,787 --> 00:24:07,122
Went over,
made sure her bills got paid.

00:24:07,189 --> 00:24:09,325
Brought her medication.

00:24:09,391 --> 00:24:11,160
Stocked the fridge.

00:24:11,226 --> 00:24:13,996
All the stuff
any good son's supposed to do.

00:24:14,063 --> 00:24:16,332
WILLOWS:
Mr. Elliot

00:24:16,398 --> 00:24:18,367
we found
your mother's safe.

00:24:18,434 --> 00:24:20,169
It was busted open

00:24:20,235 --> 00:24:21,870
and your prints
were all over it.

00:24:21,937 --> 00:24:23,539
( <i>scoffs</i> )

00:24:23,606 --> 00:24:24,840
Something funny?

00:24:24,907 --> 00:24:27,176
About a month ago,
she called me up--

00:24:27,242 --> 00:24:29,478
middle of the night--
hysterical.

00:24:29,545 --> 00:24:32,348
Her precious tabby
was locked inside.

00:24:32,414 --> 00:24:35,017
She couldn't remember the combo.

00:24:38,787 --> 00:24:40,823
I didn't steal her money.

00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:42,558
She didn't <i>have</i> any.

00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:45,761
The only thing she
owned was the house.

00:24:45,828 --> 00:24:49,331
And she left that
to some damn cat sanctuary.

00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,535
And so...

00:24:53,602 --> 00:24:55,638
that's it?

00:24:56,672 --> 00:24:58,674
I'm flat broke

00:24:58,741 --> 00:25:01,744
and she gives her house
to complete strangers.

00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:04,079
Can, uh...

00:25:05,981 --> 00:25:08,550
can somebody drive me back
to my car

00:25:08,617 --> 00:25:10,352
if we're done?

00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:13,222
MARCIE:
<i>You know, since my car blew up</i>

00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:16,058
<i>everybody</i> is
in my business.

00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:18,827
All of a sudden,
everybody has something to say.

00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:21,130
You know, an opinion,
a theory.

00:25:21,196 --> 00:25:22,431
My life is
an open book

00:25:22,498 --> 00:25:24,500
and my father wants me to hire
a bodyguard.

00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:25,934
For what?

00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:27,469
To protect me from who?

00:25:27,536 --> 00:25:29,138
You know what I think?
Someone put the bomb

00:25:29,204 --> 00:25:30,806
in the wrong car.
I think they confused

00:25:30,873 --> 00:25:32,107
our house with
somebody else's

00:25:32,174 --> 00:25:34,076
because stranger
things have happened.
Marcie?

00:25:34,143 --> 00:25:36,211
Yeah. Sorry.

00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:39,481
Maybe we should talk alone.

00:25:39,548 --> 00:25:41,450
MARCIE:
Uh, we don't have

00:25:41,517 --> 00:25:42,718
any secrets.

00:25:42,785 --> 00:25:44,086
Okay.

00:25:44,153 --> 00:25:47,156
Listen-- about
your marriage--
your father said...

00:25:47,222 --> 00:25:49,925
Oh, my God. My father shouldn't
have said anything.

00:25:49,992 --> 00:25:52,127
Your father ran his mouth
about our personal life?

00:25:52,194 --> 00:25:53,629
Johnny, you know what?
I, um...

00:25:53,696 --> 00:25:55,331
A couple of weeks ago

00:25:55,397 --> 00:25:57,399
I thought that maybe Johnny
was fooling around

00:25:57,466 --> 00:25:58,901
just because
he was never home...

00:25:58,968 --> 00:26:00,402
I was working.
and never
interested...

00:26:00,469 --> 00:26:02,738
Marcie, we talked
about this. You
know the pressure

00:26:02,805 --> 00:26:04,440
your father
has me under.
I know. I know.

00:26:04,506 --> 00:26:06,241
It's not fair.
And you know what?

00:26:06,308 --> 00:26:07,977
You shouldn't
put too much
stock in this

00:26:08,043 --> 00:26:09,111
because every couple has

00:26:09,178 --> 00:26:11,046
their problems.
Marcie and I
have had enough.

00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:13,082
That's it. Now,
you have your
warrant, fine.

00:26:13,148 --> 00:26:14,817
But please

00:26:14,883 --> 00:26:16,885
no more questions.

00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:18,087
( <i>Marcie sighs</i> )

00:26:18,153 --> 00:26:20,122
Just take what you need.

00:26:30,866 --> 00:26:33,102
Hey. You got a head start.

00:26:33,168 --> 00:26:35,104
Yeah, didn't even have to wait
for my warrant.

00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,505
I just rolled over
to Tobin C &amp;amp; D

00:26:36,572 --> 00:26:37,973
and before I could say
"vice grip"

00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,209
the senior foreman gave me
every grip in the house.

00:26:40,276 --> 00:26:41,477
Bad news, though.
No matches.

00:26:41,543 --> 00:26:43,178
Ah! One more vice grip

00:26:43,245 --> 00:26:46,515
compliments of
the Tobin/Claddon household.

00:27:11,473 --> 00:27:12,875
Aw...

00:27:12,942 --> 00:27:15,210

the same size.

00:27:15,277 --> 00:27:16,345
No.

00:27:16,412 --> 00:27:18,013
And we're out of vice grips.

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,181
We're out of luck.

00:27:19,248 --> 00:27:21,150
Let's unwrap the Beemer.

00:27:24,053 --> 00:27:28,157
You know, when I was 16,
I begged my mom for a car.

00:27:28,223 --> 00:27:29,858
Swore she'd
come through.

00:27:29,925 --> 00:27:30,859
What happened?

00:27:30,926 --> 00:27:32,828
<i>Encyclopedia Britannica.</i>

00:27:32,895 --> 00:27:33,933

Still own them, still use them.

00:27:40,433 --> 00:27:42,135
Okay.

00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:45,142
Mechanic found the bomb
next to the engine mount

00:27:45,142 --> 00:27:46,349
closest point to the driver.

00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:47,884
Bomb was on a delay.

00:27:47,951 --> 00:27:51,421
Clock with a ticking second hand
and a nail driven into "12."

00:27:53,975 --> 00:27:55,476
That means
the bomb was triggered

00:27:55,543 --> 00:27:58,346
60 seconds before detonation,
one rotation of the second hand.

00:27:59,308 --> 00:28:02,110
Question is, what
started the clock?

00:28:04,146 --> 00:28:06,882
Something Marcie Tobin touched
inside the car?

00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:19,308
<i>Ignition, door locks</i>

00:28:19,308 --> 00:28:21,510

00:28:24,813 --> 00:28:27,983
Yeah, but we're only dealing
with a 60-second time frame.

00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,418
Okay, she pulls into the lot

00:28:29,485 --> 00:28:31,787
she gets out of the car,
and she asks for help.

00:28:31,854 --> 00:28:33,556
Mechanic offers to take a look.

00:28:33,622 --> 00:28:35,724
So, she pops the hood for him.

00:28:38,127 --> 00:28:39,862
Hood release.

00:28:42,264 --> 00:28:43,999
Whoa.

00:28:44,066 --> 00:28:46,101
The latch has been blown apart.

00:28:46,168 --> 00:28:50,105
Which means the hood was down
when the bomb was detonated.

00:28:52,474 --> 00:28:54,410
How is that possible?

00:28:54,476 --> 00:28:56,879
The mechanic saw the bomb.

00:28:56,946 --> 00:28:59,381
X-ray vision?

00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:01,884
Okay, maybe he took one look
at it, and he slammed the hood.

00:29:01,951 --> 00:29:03,953
Sara, if you found a bomb
in your car

00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:05,421
would you close the hood?

00:29:05,487 --> 00:29:07,723
No, I would back away fast.

00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,259
Um... maybe the hood dropped?

No way.

00:30:29,238 --> 00:30:30,840
I just absorb information.

00:30:30,906 --> 00:30:32,274
I thought that was <i>my</i> line.

00:30:32,341 --> 00:30:34,410
Yeah, and I absorbed it.

00:30:34,476 --> 00:30:35,411
Okay, so...

00:30:35,477 --> 00:30:36,545
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:30:36,612 --> 00:30:37,913
knives, screwdriver
ice pick

00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,448
letter opener.

00:30:39,515 --> 00:30:41,750
We're looking for a weapon
with a splash of mineral oil.

00:30:41,817 --> 00:30:42,818
I'll grab the A.L.S.

00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:46,255
An A.L.S. for mineral oil?

00:30:46,322 --> 00:30:49,592
Mineral oil fluoresces
at 525 nanometers

00:30:49,658 --> 00:30:52,161
when filtered through a KV590.

00:30:52,228 --> 00:30:55,898
A little more absorbing,
a little less rock and roll.

00:30:59,435 --> 00:31:02,404
( <i>dog barking</i> )

00:31:05,241 --> 00:31:07,543
( <i>machine humming</i> )

00:31:36,205 --> 00:31:37,473
Now what?

00:31:38,707 --> 00:31:40,209
( <i>meowing</i> )

00:31:43,879 --> 00:31:46,615
I thought Animal Control
rounded up all the cats.

00:31:46,682 --> 00:31:48,417
Where are you going?

00:31:48,484 --> 00:31:50,452
Following the evidence.

00:31:57,726 --> 00:31:58,808
( <i>meows</i> )

00:31:58,808 --> 00:32:00,409
Wait. Rascal.

00:32:01,142 --> 00:32:02,744
Hi.

00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,178
( <i>Rascal meows</i> )

00:32:04,245 --> 00:32:05,580
How'd you get out?

00:32:05,646 --> 00:32:06,948
Hi. Girls.

00:32:07,014 --> 00:32:08,483
Say hi, Rascal.

00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:09,784
WILLOWS:
Hi, Rascal.

00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,424
Excuse me, uh...
may I hold your cat?

00:32:16,491 --> 00:32:18,726
No. He doesn't like you.

00:32:19,727 --> 00:32:22,497
Girls, dinner.

00:32:22,563 --> 00:32:24,065
Can't she see
we're playing?

00:32:24,132 --> 00:32:25,333
Just ignore her.

00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,934
MRS. TRENT:
Girls.

00:32:27,001 --> 00:32:29,237
I see you've met Rascal.

00:32:29,303 --> 00:32:31,267
Mrs. Trent, I noticed this
cat has a sore on its leg.

00:32:31,267 --> 00:32:33,002
I'd be happy to
swab it for you.

00:32:33,068 --> 00:32:35,237
Might need
medical attention.
No.

00:32:35,304 --> 00:32:37,039
I don't think that
that's really necessary.

00:32:37,106 --> 00:32:38,307
It's just a cut; it'll heal.

00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,075
But I mean,
for your daughter's sake

00:32:40,142 --> 00:32:42,011
wouldn't you rather be safe
than sorry?

00:32:42,077 --> 00:32:44,780
I think it's time
to go inside.

00:32:44,847 --> 00:32:47,683
Uh, Jessica...
I-I think he might have a point.

00:32:51,587 --> 00:32:53,822
I want her to do it.

00:32:57,993 --> 00:33:00,329
Okay.

00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:02,498
Rascal.

00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:09,171
( <i>Rascal meows</i> )

00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:11,774
All righty.

00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,208
Thank you.

00:33:14,777 --> 00:33:16,378
MRS. TRENT:
Okay, girls,
go wash up.

00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,949
Come on, Jackie,
let's go.

00:33:20,015 --> 00:33:22,217
Kids these days,
they just don't listen.

00:33:22,284 --> 00:33:24,320
Two against one.

00:33:26,555 --> 00:33:28,390
Thank you.
See you later.

00:33:29,658 --> 00:33:31,026
One thing about my mother

00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:33,762
even though she was deaf,
she was always the boss.

00:33:33,829 --> 00:33:35,631
Huh. Well...

00:33:35,698 --> 00:33:37,166
single mom...

00:33:37,232 --> 00:33:38,767
juggling a job, a boyfriend.

00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:40,669
It's just easier
to say yes than no

00:33:40,736 --> 00:33:43,739
and then eventually,
they just stop asking
for permission.

00:33:43,806 --> 00:33:46,141
You want to tell me why
I swabbed their cat?

00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:49,044
That cat has an open sore
and a missing patch of fur--

00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:51,413
both indicative
of possible staph infection.

00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,117
And we know that our victim
had a staph infection.

00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:56,585
Staphylococcus bacteria

00:33:56,652 --> 00:33:59,255
can jump the species barrier--

00:33:59,321 --> 00:34:01,390
be passed from human to animal.

00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:03,759
MAN:
<i>Guess I must have</i>
<i>shut it, then.</i>

00:34:03,826 --> 00:34:06,128
I wasn't thinking;
I was reacting, you know?

00:34:06,195 --> 00:34:07,329
No harm, no foul.

00:34:07,396 --> 00:34:09,765
STOKES:
No prints.
Come again?

00:34:09,832 --> 00:34:11,834
Well, if you were pawing
all over the hood

00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,535
then your prints
should be on it.

00:34:13,602 --> 00:34:14,903
And they're not.

00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,672
I wear gloves.

00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:17,773
You're not wearing them now.

00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,209
I wear them most of the time.

00:34:20,276 --> 00:34:21,410
Mind if we take a look

00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:23,712
around the garage?
Knock yourselves out.

00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,882
( <i>electric tool whirring</i> )

00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:32,354
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

00:34:32,421 --> 00:34:34,056
Mechanics use vice grips?

00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:40,129
You got any clay?
No.

00:34:40,195 --> 00:34:44,300
Well... we can't just take
the tool without a warrant.

00:34:47,303 --> 00:34:48,771
But...

00:34:51,707 --> 00:34:55,110
we can improvise.

00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:56,745
Trash is trash.

00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:58,948
Cheese. Nice.

00:35:02,618 --> 00:35:04,553
I'll compare this

00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,322
with our case toolmark.

00:35:09,758 --> 00:35:11,260
You guys having fun?

00:35:11,327 --> 00:35:12,394
A blast.

00:35:12,461 --> 00:35:13,596
Hey, man...

00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,631
These yours?

00:35:15,698 --> 00:35:16,932
Don't use vice grips--

00:35:16,999 --> 00:35:18,734
pipe wrench has a better feel.

00:35:18,801 --> 00:35:20,736
Must belong
to one of my mechanics.

00:35:20,803 --> 00:35:21,971
I'll take
the prints on those.

00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:24,306
Boy, you just have an answer
for everything, don't you?

00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:25,975
Yeah, I guess I do.

00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:53,235
Striae are identical.

00:35:53,302 --> 00:35:55,337
Auto Body vice grip
was definitely used

00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:57,172
to tighten the end cap.

00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,041
Mechanic's prints on file?

00:35:59,108 --> 00:36:01,911
Marcus Remmick.
Arrested for fraud in 1994.

00:36:01,977 --> 00:36:04,113
He was selling
used parts as new.

00:36:04,179 --> 00:36:06,515
Prints are in AFIS, but they
don't match the vice grip.

00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:08,417
And, in fact,
AFIS drew a blank.

00:36:08,484 --> 00:36:11,120
Hmm. Then what are you running?

00:36:11,186 --> 00:36:13,155
I'm running
a Tobin C&amp;amp;D database.

00:36:13,222 --> 00:36:14,690
Oh. Shot in the dark.

00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:16,358
( <i>beeps</i> )

00:36:20,629 --> 00:36:23,532

Even a shot in the dark hits
sometimes.

SIDLE:
Not only did
you put a bomb

00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:31,006
in your car--
you made it yourself.

00:36:31,073 --> 00:36:32,107
Why would I do that?

00:36:32,174 --> 00:36:33,509
BRASS:
The business
registration

00:36:33,575 --> 00:36:35,911
shows that you own 25%
of your father's company.

00:36:35,978 --> 00:36:38,914
So Nevada's a community property
state-- you divorce Johnny

00:36:38,981 --> 00:36:41,250
he becomes a part-owner
of Tobin Construction.

00:36:41,317 --> 00:36:43,586
That wouldn't sit too well
with Dad, would it?

00:36:43,652 --> 00:36:45,521
SIDLE:
<i>But</i> if Johnny
goes down

00:36:45,588 --> 00:36:47,022
for attempted murder,
he goes to jail

00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:49,058
and you get to keep everything,
because a criminal

00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,659
can't benefit
from his own malfeasance.

00:36:50,726 --> 00:36:53,596
This is absurd.

00:36:53,662 --> 00:36:55,998
You know, for your
information, um

00:36:56,065 --> 00:36:58,400
your mechanic friend
lawyered up.

00:36:58,467 --> 00:36:59,935
Guys with records
roll fast.

00:37:00,002 --> 00:37:01,870
He's not my friend.
STOKES:
Really?

00:37:01,937 --> 00:37:05,007
Because we found
your prints on a tool
at the body shop.

00:37:05,074 --> 00:37:08,444
It was the same tool
we know was used to
make the pipe bomb.

00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,315
( <i>quietly</i> ):
Sit down.

00:37:17,353 --> 00:37:19,755
SIDLE:
You and Marcus
tag-teamed us.

00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:22,358
You never popped the hood; he
never shut it-- it was latched.

00:37:22,424 --> 00:37:24,093
Fortunately for you,
you only worked

00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,928
Thursday nights,
because your little plan

00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:27,563
took a lot of extra
time and effort?

00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:45,080
That's not a crime.

Really?

00:37:46,582 --> 00:37:48,284
You sure about that?

00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:56,458
Ready.

60 seconds.

00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,439

You used to own
a '92 Volvo.

00:38:10,506 --> 00:38:12,074
I ran your credit card.

00:38:12,141 --> 00:38:13,342
You owe $20,000

00:38:13,409 --> 00:38:14,877
in auto body repairs.

00:38:14,944 --> 00:38:16,612
Your dad kicked
in $30,000.

00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:18,147
I ran his credit card, too.

That's 50 g's

You needed Marcus' help
to wire the bomb

and substantiate
your story.

00:38:25,487 --> 00:38:29,758
So the two of you
paid him $50,000 for
services rendered.

00:38:29,825 --> 00:38:32,995
Look, I'm fine,
and my husband is fine

00:38:33,062 --> 00:38:35,164
and it was my car that exploded

00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,734
so does this...
really need to go any further?

00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:40,769
BRASS:
Ma'am, you and
your father

00:38:40,836 --> 00:38:44,039
conspired to frame your husband
for attempted murder.

STOKES:
So, you're both looking
at, what, uh...

00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:49,144
20-plus.

00:38:50,713 --> 00:38:53,182
Oh, and Johnny's getting
a promotion.

00:39:04,126 --> 00:39:06,729
Girl's cat...

00:39:06,795 --> 00:39:09,331
positive for staphylococcus.

00:39:09,398 --> 00:39:11,333
You know,
I spoke with Janet Trent.

00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,535
She and her daughters
are all healthy.

00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:16,338
Could their cat have been
infected by Mrs. Elliot?

00:39:16,405 --> 00:39:18,374
Could Rascal

00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,409
have been her cat at one time?

00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:24,079
What, and she...

00:39:24,146 --> 00:39:25,848
gave it to
the girls?
No.

00:39:25,915 --> 00:39:28,684
So if it was hers, and she...

00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:31,020
didn't give it away...

00:39:31,086 --> 00:39:35,157
Maybe someone in the Trent house
adopted it.

00:39:35,224 --> 00:39:38,294
( <i>indistinct radio transmission)</i>

00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:31,747
We know that Mrs. Elliot
was killed by this pen.

00:40:31,814 --> 00:40:35,017
Can one of you tell me
what happened?

00:40:37,553 --> 00:40:40,189
Girls, do you understand what
Ms. Willows is asking you?

00:40:47,896 --> 00:40:50,266
I'll tell.
No. You promised.

00:40:50,332 --> 00:40:53,769
WILLOWS:
Jessica, in this room,
the only promise you make

00:40:53,836 --> 00:40:56,071
is to tell the truth.

00:40:56,138 --> 00:40:57,706
She didn't mean to do it.

00:40:57,773 --> 00:40:59,241
I'm sure she didn't.

00:40:59,308 --> 00:41:01,510
Who?

00:41:02,912 --> 00:41:04,914
Mommy.

00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:14,924
What did your mother do?

00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:18,928
Mrs. Elliot should have just
given us the cat.

00:41:18,994 --> 00:41:20,863
He's always at our house.

00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:22,031
Rascal likes
it there.

00:41:22,097 --> 00:41:23,999
I won't give them away.

00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:25,167
Look, then I'll
pay you for him.

00:41:25,234 --> 00:41:26,769
I'm sorry.

00:41:26,835 --> 00:41:28,003
Every child
should have a cat

00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,271
but these are mine.

00:41:29,338 --> 00:41:30,205
Just give me...
Oh!

00:41:30,272 --> 00:41:31,273
Girls, take the cat and run.

00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,342
Go. Go.

00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:35,711
ELLIOT ( <i>crying</i> ):
No! Please... no!

00:41:35,778 --> 00:41:39,048
So then we ran, and that's when
we heard the old lady scream.

00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,751
Jackie?

00:41:45,287 --> 00:41:46,789
Girls, do you...

00:41:46,855 --> 00:41:48,490
know about fingerprints?

00:41:51,694 --> 00:41:53,829
When you... touch something--

00:41:53,896 --> 00:41:57,933
like this floaty pen,
for instance--

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,203
you leave behind
an invisible mark

00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:04,073
that's special,
that's yours.

00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:08,177
I have a way to...

00:42:08,243 --> 00:42:11,280
see these invisible marks.

00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:17,186
And we found these fingerprints
on the pen.

00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:21,724
And they don't belong
to an adult.

00:42:28,831 --> 00:42:30,633
They're not mine.

00:42:32,334 --> 00:42:35,537
Tattletales burn in hell.

00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:42,978
The old lady should have just
given <i>me</i> the cat.

00:42:43,045 --> 00:42:45,180
I lied before.

00:42:45,247 --> 00:42:47,616
She wasn't nice.

00:42:47,683 --> 00:42:50,519
She was mean.

00:42:50,586 --> 00:42:53,055
My mom said we can
keep him. Please?

00:42:53,122 --> 00:42:56,125
These are <i>my</i> babies.
I don't give them away.

00:42:56,191 --> 00:42:57,359
But you have so many.

00:42:57,426 --> 00:42:58,727
We don't have even one.

00:42:58,794 --> 00:42:59,828
I'm sorry.

00:43:03,766 --> 00:43:05,401
Run, Jackie!

00:43:08,804 --> 00:43:10,506
I'll tell your mother!
You won't!

00:43:33,662 --> 00:43:35,064
Did you know?

00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:37,700
I told the girls
that they could have a cat

00:43:37,766 --> 00:43:41,770
<i>if</i> Mrs. Elliot gave them one.

00:43:41,837 --> 00:43:45,441
I knew she never would.

00:43:45,507 --> 00:43:47,776
That's why I made the promise.

00:43:47,843 --> 00:43:50,613
JESSICA:
No, I need Mommy.

00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:53,849
( <i>crying</i> ):
Mommy. I want
my mommy!

00:43:53,916 --> 00:43:56,352
No! Jessica!

00:43:56,933 --> 00:43:58,434
Mommy...

00:44:00,433 --> 00:44:03,102
( <i>crying</i> ):
<i>Mommy...</i>
