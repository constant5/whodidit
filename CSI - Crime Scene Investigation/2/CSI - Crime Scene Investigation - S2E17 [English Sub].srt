"Wherever you live

Paramedics just pronounced.

00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,124
Four dead, no witnesses.

00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:58,392
Coroner's on his way.

00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:00,561
Guy in the robe flagged down
an officer.

00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,696
"Guy in the robe"
is a monk, Nick.

00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:04,398
Yeah? Well...

00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,367
he's a quiet monk.

00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,869
Nonnative, from Thailand.

00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:21,081
SIDLE:
Rug's low pile, smooth.

00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:23,150
I'll try to dust lift.

00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:24,718
Okay.

00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:27,221
Let's hug the walls.

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,828
( <i>Grissom sighs</i> )

00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:37,364
Gunshot to the head.

Times four.

00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:52,312
SIDLE:
Gold statues...

00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,547
money trees...

00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,349
That's a lot of loot
to leave behind.

00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:58,218
This wasn't a robbery.

00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,787
This was a hit.

00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:19,807
Five years ago, West Vegas...

00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,242
German tourist took
a wrong turn, ended up dead.

00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,644
This "placa" was sprayed

00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,113
across the windshield
of their rental car.

00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,048
It's the Snakebacks.

00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:30,584
Gangbangers?
At a Buddhist temple?

00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,353
Stippling around entry.

00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,825
Close range.

00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,194
Looks like they were shot
one at a time.

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,895
How do you
get one vic--

00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:43,931
let alone four-- to sit still

00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,834
while you put a bullet
between their eyes?

00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,836
They were praying.

00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,337
Yeah, for mercy.

00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:53,207

What can you tell me
about the victims?

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,955
We came from Thailand

00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:14,390
to share Buddhism
here in Nevada.

00:04:14,457 --> 00:04:17,760
But you didn't share
the last couple hours together.

Where were <i>you?</i>

00:04:19,696 --> 00:04:20,964
I was at the bank.

We're raising money
to build a school.

00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,636
I was making
a deposit.

00:04:26,703 --> 00:04:28,805
Where are
the other monks?

00:04:28,872 --> 00:04:30,206
On a retreat.

00:04:30,273 --> 00:04:32,742
They come
back tomorrow.

00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:34,277
May I ask a question?

00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:36,880
This is
a high-crime area.

00:04:36,946 --> 00:04:39,816
Have you had
any problems here before?

00:04:39,883 --> 00:04:42,152
Like break-ins or burglaries?

00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:44,154
The past...

00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,156
is in the past.

00:04:46,222 --> 00:04:48,124
True.

00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:52,061
But sometimes, it leaves
its fingerprints on the future.

00:05:04,674 --> 00:05:06,943
Aren't you on duty?

00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:07,944

Fine. Sit.

Attitude adjustment?

00:05:17,887 --> 00:05:19,689
For the wife.

Says she can't face me
without it.

Ah. How is Mrs. Tadero?

Yeah.

So, did <i>you</i> see it?

The confession?

00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:49,927
On TV, yeah.

00:05:49,994 --> 00:05:52,029
And what do you think?

00:05:52,096 --> 00:05:54,198
I always regretted the jury
didn't give him the chair.

00:05:54,265 --> 00:05:55,833
But I'll take cancer,
long as he's gone.

00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,602
I've made a lot of mistakes.

00:05:57,668 --> 00:06:01,005
I killed that guy in Reno.

00:06:01,072 --> 00:06:05,076

Stephanie Watson.

Deathbed denial.

Negotiate with God
for a better seat in hell.

00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,622
What if Kelso
didn't kill Stephanie?

00:06:17,688 --> 00:06:20,391

15 years ago. He did it.

( <i>people laughing</i> )

00:06:34,305 --> 00:06:36,808
Witnesses saw him bothering her

Uniform picks him up
a block from the alley.

00:06:38,943 --> 00:06:40,611
Knife cut on his hand.
Come on, Cath!

00:06:40,678 --> 00:06:44,782
Well... maybe I'm just afraid
ifI accept that he killed her

00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:47,518
that it's over,
and Stephanie's really dead.

00:06:47,585 --> 00:06:49,487

The evidence.

00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:02,333
<i>The statute says that</i>
<i>once the convicted party</i>

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,503
is executed or dies,
the evidence can be destroyed.

00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,504
I-It's not here.

00:07:06,571 --> 00:07:08,506
Relax. They said
it'd be here.

00:07:08,573 --> 00:07:10,942
Yeah, well,
people make mistakes.

00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:14,946
Well, that's why we
have computer tracking.

00:07:15,012 --> 00:07:16,214
Fourteen...

00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,015
It was 15, right?

00:07:18,082 --> 00:07:19,517
Yeah.

00:07:19,584 --> 00:07:21,619
Fifteen...

00:07:21,686 --> 00:07:22,854
Stephanie Watson, right?

00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,388
Yeah.

00:07:26,858 --> 00:07:29,193
Yeah, that's it.

00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:36,467
This was my old life.

00:07:36,534 --> 00:07:37,769
Yeah?

00:07:37,835 --> 00:07:40,238
We all have a past, huh?

00:07:45,576 --> 00:07:47,845
Stephanie was my best friend.

00:07:47,912 --> 00:07:49,847
Hey, we still on for tonight?

00:07:49,914 --> 00:07:51,249
I got a gig.

00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:53,251
I promised him I'd be there.
Forgive me?

00:07:53,317 --> 00:07:54,786
Just this once.

00:07:54,852 --> 00:07:57,355
I never saw her again.

00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:04,328
What exactly are we looking for?

00:08:04,395 --> 00:08:05,663
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,498
Peace of mind
that they got the killer.

00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,236
Well, I'd start with this.

00:08:14,572 --> 00:08:16,507
( <i>man speaking</i>
<i>foreign language</i> )

00:08:16,574 --> 00:08:17,775
Forgive me.

00:08:17,842 --> 00:08:20,078
English is my second language.

00:08:20,144 --> 00:08:21,813
I understand you fine.

00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:24,148
So, you're
the part-time cook here?

00:08:24,215 --> 00:08:25,516
How many days a week

00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,018
do you work at the temple?

00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:28,086
Three.

00:08:28,152 --> 00:08:30,054
You have a key?

00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:31,622
No need.

00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:33,491
The door is always open.

00:08:33,558 --> 00:08:35,760
I told the monks.

00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:37,328
Too trusting.

00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:40,231
In this neighborhood, yeah.

00:08:40,298 --> 00:08:42,200
They ever have
any problems with gangs?

00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:43,401
Couple months ago

00:08:43,468 --> 00:08:46,237
I saw spray paints
on the back wall.

00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:48,272
Gang signs.

00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:51,843
I wanted to file
a police report, but Ananda...

00:08:51,909 --> 00:08:54,078
told me not to.

00:08:54,145 --> 00:08:55,880
Why not?

00:08:57,482 --> 00:08:59,016
I told you.

00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,953
"Monks are too trusting."

00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:48,693
Interesting reading
for a man of the cloth.

00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,363
That monk had it in the
bottom of his desk drawer.

00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:53,398
And he was the guy
handling the money.

00:10:53,465 --> 00:10:55,400
You hide one thing
from your brothers

00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,756
then maybe he
was hiding more.

00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,092
Yeah, but just 'cause
you're stashing trash

00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:01,526
doesn't make you a killer.

00:11:01,593 --> 00:11:03,628
Yeah, I'm just...
talking it out, Sara.

00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:04,896
What'd you find?

00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:06,932
I found some boot prints
on the prayer room rug.

00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,467
Monks don't wear boots,
right, Nick?

00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:11,169
No, no, or read porn
or commit murder.

00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:13,605
I also found a smudge
with some trace material

00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,173
on a small statue.

00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,843
It was a partial, some ridge
detail, but not makable

00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:20,712
and a wad of gum that was stuck
to the big Buddha.

00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:23,815
All of which is definitely
pointing to an outside job.

00:11:23,882 --> 00:11:25,517
Hey, whatever.
Outside, inside.

00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:28,253
Why shoot four people, then
leave the murder weapon

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,323
behind the temple where even
a blind man could find it?

00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,158
And I hate taking off my shoes.

00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,934
MAN:
All were shot
in the third eye

00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:46,171
the sixth chakra,
vortex of consciousness.

00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:49,741
I was a <i>Gray's Anatomy</i> man,
until I lost my legs.

00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:52,044
I started getting
phantom pains

00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,513
no drug or exercise
could control.

00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:56,581
I began studying
the chakras.

00:11:56,648 --> 00:11:59,317
Well, I do know that
the seven chakras

00:11:59,384 --> 00:12:02,654
correspond to the body's
seven energy centers.

00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,123
Each has a color
and a vibration.

00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:09,127
Muladhara, the root chakra,
keeps us in the physical world.

00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:13,398
Svadisthana, seat
of sexual energy.

00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:17,402
Manipura, melting pot of
spiritual and earthly desires.

00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:19,905
Anahata, the loving heart.

00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:23,008
Visuddha, where feelings
are given expression.

00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,043
Ajna, the third eye.

00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,412
Saharsrara, the
crown connecting

00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:31,383
the mortal human to
the timeless universe.

00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,385
Let's go back to
the third eye.

00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,486
Ajna, the hub

00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,254
of higher consciousness.

00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:39,324
If someone were threatened
by that consciousness

00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,326
that would be
a logical target, yeah?

00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:44,363
Hmm, there's a very good chance
your killer's a Buddhist.

00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:46,331
SANDERS:
<i>Now, this is</i>
<i>where Ecklie swabbed</i>

00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:49,835
the blood sample
from the blade 15 years ago.

00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:51,770
It's your friend's

00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,605
Stephanie Watson.

00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:56,775
And we got the second sample
from the handle end.

00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,311
Perfect match to Dwight Kelso

00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:02,214
the guy convicted
for Stephanie's murder.

00:13:04,182 --> 00:13:06,018
Thank you, Greg.

00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:07,686
Thank you.

00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,921
Had to be hard on you.

00:13:09,988 --> 00:13:12,858
Losing a friend,
someone that you...

00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:15,027
I'm taking this to Trace.

00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,334
Did I miss something?

00:13:23,835 --> 00:13:26,238
You see that?

00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:29,074
Hmm, it's blood.
That's a weak sample.

00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,343
That's probably
why Ecklie took
the thicker one.

00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,845
15 years ago, we figured,
why light up something

00:13:33,912 --> 00:13:35,814
you can't analyze
in the first place?

00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,550
Yeah, except now,
we can replicate
DNA a million times

00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,719
even from the most minute
sample of blood.

00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,821
Priority.

00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,823
Let me know
what you find out.

00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,525
Yes, ma'am.

00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:51,763
Bobby D. shot
the test bullet

00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,066
through the rifle you
found behind the temple.

00:13:54,132 --> 00:13:55,767
It's on the right.

00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,637
Bullet from vic
number three
on the left.

00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,839
Lans and grooves
align perfectly.

00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:04,309
GRISSOM:
Well, we've got ourselves
a murder weapon.

00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,244
Well, we've got
more than that.

00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:08,146
Sara and I found prints
off the rifle.

00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:09,448
And?

00:14:09,514 --> 00:14:11,350
Well, I'll give you
a hint.

00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,984
He's bald, he wears a robe

00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:15,087
and he likes his coeds
bodacious.

00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:17,389
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:20,592
One survivor,
one suspect.

00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,428
And a whole lot
of bad karma.

00:14:25,504 --> 00:14:27,473
I entered through the back.

00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:29,375
The rifle was on my desk.

00:14:29,441 --> 00:14:31,577
I walked into the prayer room

00:14:31,643 --> 00:14:34,046
to ask my brothers
about the gun.

00:14:35,587 --> 00:14:38,890
I returned to my office,
placed the weapon outside

00:14:38,957 --> 00:14:40,959
and went for help.

00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,307
Tampering with evidence is
against the law.

00:14:45,374 --> 00:14:46,795
The temple is a holy place.

00:14:46,795 --> 00:14:49,765
Maybe, but a crime had been
committed there.

00:14:49,831 --> 00:14:52,768
Please understand,
I was obeying my teachings.

00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:56,138
Do your teachings allow you
to keep pornography?

00:14:56,204 --> 00:14:58,907
Someone left the magazine
at the temple.

00:14:58,974 --> 00:14:59,942
I kept it

00:15:00,008 --> 00:15:01,576
in case this
person came back.

00:15:01,643 --> 00:15:02,778
Yeah, right.

00:15:04,146 --> 00:15:07,049
If you are no longer attached
to seeking pleasure

00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,450
pictures of naked women

00:15:08,517 --> 00:15:10,953
mean no more than pictures
of waterfalls.

00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:16,216
I abstain from
erotic behavior not
because we believe

00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,718
sex is sinful

00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:21,621
but because preoccupation
with worldly pleasure

00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,790
diverts us from the path.

00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:25,379
Got to be a lot easier
to be a monk

00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:26,837
in a monastery on a mountaintop

00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:28,705
than one on Las Vegas Boulevard.

00:15:31,107 --> 00:15:33,643
I ran that faint blood
sample from the knife.

00:15:36,504 --> 00:15:38,172
Wow.

00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,507
Yeah, I know.

00:15:39,573 --> 00:15:40,495
ECKLIE:
Willows.

00:15:40,562 --> 00:15:42,100
Just the person
I wanted to see.

00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:45,367
I just signed off

00:15:45,434 --> 00:15:47,075
on the Authorization
to Destroy Evidence

00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:48,876
in the Stephanie Watson
homicides

00:15:48,943 --> 00:15:51,713
since I was the primary,
and then I learned tonight

00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:53,848
that the evidence
has been checked out

00:15:53,915 --> 00:15:55,350
by you and Warrick.

00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,851
You care to explain that?

00:15:56,918 --> 00:15:59,187
Found a third donor
on the knife.

00:15:59,253 --> 00:16:01,255
Blood's from a male.
Unknown.

00:16:01,322 --> 00:16:03,491
But Kelso didn't have
an accomplice.

00:16:03,558 --> 00:16:06,494
Then you know why
we're looking at the file.

00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:09,097
Hey.
Hey.

00:16:09,163 --> 00:16:11,366
Here's the good news.

00:16:11,432 --> 00:16:13,334
Look at his hands.

00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:15,737
The cut on his
left index finger--

00:16:15,803 --> 00:16:19,173
it's just like
the evidence log says.

00:16:21,442 --> 00:16:24,879
Kelso's glove
is not in any

00:16:24,946 --> 00:16:28,416
of the crime scene photos,
any of the sketches, anywhere.

00:16:28,483 --> 00:16:30,018
ECKLIE:
Pictures get lost, Warrick.

00:16:30,084 --> 00:16:32,186
I do remember that glove,
though.

00:16:32,253 --> 00:16:34,255
Kelso's blood was all over it.

00:16:34,322 --> 00:16:36,290
It is in the evidence log.

00:16:36,357 --> 00:16:38,192
You see
who logged it in?

00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:40,528
Jimmy Tadero.

00:16:42,463 --> 00:16:46,968
Booked two days
after the murder.

00:16:48,503 --> 00:16:50,138
So why no photos?

00:16:50,204 --> 00:16:52,240
Want me to tag along?

00:16:52,307 --> 00:16:53,574
He's my mentor.

00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:54,876
If he screwed up

00:16:54,942 --> 00:16:57,178
I don't think
he's going to want an audience.

00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:03,697
( <i>computer beeps</i> )

00:17:03,763 --> 00:17:04,931
( <i>keyboard clacks</i> )

00:17:06,004 --> 00:17:07,038
You know those prints

00:17:07,105 --> 00:17:08,740
that Nick and I
got off the rifle?

00:17:08,807 --> 00:17:10,546
GRISSOM:
D.A. says it's enough
for a warrant.

00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:11,914
Ananda's already
in custody.

00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:13,171
Well, I better talk fast, then.

00:17:13,171 --> 00:17:15,306
The prints are
only telling half the story.

00:17:15,373 --> 00:17:17,976
Even when a shooter holds a gun,
he grips the barrel

00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:21,112
<i>and he wraps his index finger</i>
<i>around the trigger.</i>

00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:23,281
Ananda never fingered
the trigger.

00:17:23,348 --> 00:17:24,682
What about the prints?

00:17:24,749 --> 00:17:28,386
On the weapon, but definitely
not where they should be.

00:17:28,453 --> 00:17:29,721
( <i>computer beeps</i> )

00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:41,823
He held the rifle
by the stock

00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,291
barrel pointing down.

00:17:43,358 --> 00:17:45,293
He never fired it.

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,162
No. Anticipating
your next question

00:17:47,229 --> 00:17:48,697
the rifle's not registered.

00:17:48,763 --> 00:17:51,399
Well, Nevada doesn't require
rifle registration.

00:17:51,466 --> 00:17:52,767
What's my next question?

00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:54,469
That chewing gum--
is with DNA.

00:18:23,431 --> 00:18:25,433
( <i>whirring</i> )

00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:29,939
"Placa" was carved
into the panel

00:18:30,006 --> 00:18:31,674
with a straight-edged blade.

00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:33,810
Nondescript.
Not much to work with.

00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:36,078
What's unusual is
the "placa" itself.

00:18:36,145 --> 00:18:38,181
Bangers tag homicides
all the time.

00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:41,217
Yeah, but after those
German tourists were killed

00:18:41,284 --> 00:18:43,853
the Snakebacks were
pretty much wiped out.

00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,255
The cops really came down hard
on those guys.

00:18:46,322 --> 00:18:48,624
27 members were put away
for... for murder

00:18:48,691 --> 00:18:51,093
and weapons possession,
drugs, you name it.

00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,628
According to the Gang Unit

00:18:52,695 --> 00:18:55,031
they've been out of business
about a year.

00:18:55,097 --> 00:18:58,034
So we're looking at a Warhol.

00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,368
Hmm?

00:18:59,435 --> 00:19:00,870
Well, it's not a real soup can.

00:19:00,937 --> 00:19:02,371
It's a painting of a soup can.

00:19:02,438 --> 00:19:05,408
Not a gang member, uh...
wannabe?

00:19:05,475 --> 00:19:08,444
Except, if you want to be
in a gang, you can be.

00:19:10,513 --> 00:19:11,881
False clue.

00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:12,982
Excuse me, sir?

00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:14,383
I'm sorry to interrupt.

00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,885
David, stop
calling me "sir."

00:19:15,952 --> 00:19:16,921
What's up
with the Air Force?

00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:18,089
You're all clear for tonight.

00:19:18,155 --> 00:19:19,223
Air Force?

00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,125
My dad's a colonel
out at Nellis.

00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:22,960
Grissom's requested
a meeting.

00:19:23,027 --> 00:19:23,594
Why?

00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:25,730
I'm enlisting.

00:19:25,796 --> 00:19:27,004
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:19:27,004 --> 00:19:29,673
Since 9-11, geosynchronous
government satellites

00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,475
have maintained
a constant watch

00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:33,377
over U.S. military
installations.

00:19:33,443 --> 00:19:36,837
And the surrounding areas
as well, right?

00:19:36,837 --> 00:19:39,807
This temple is less
than two miles from your base.

00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:43,210
What's the chances your
satellite's picked something up?

00:19:43,277 --> 00:19:45,880
We can see a postage stamp
on the sidewalk

00:19:45,946 --> 00:19:47,348
outside Lenin's tomb.

00:19:48,682 --> 00:19:50,017
Cool.

00:20:04,365 --> 00:20:06,934
Hey. Glad to see
you're not in uniform.

00:20:07,001 --> 00:20:10,371
Only one vehicle passed
through the temple gates

00:20:10,438 --> 00:20:12,573
around the time
of the murders.

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,775
Parked next
to the monk's car.

00:20:14,842 --> 00:20:18,112
"PROUD U.S."

00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:21,048
Registered to a Peter Hutchins.

00:20:21,115 --> 00:20:23,384
Did you get his picture
from outer space?

00:20:23,451 --> 00:20:25,019
All photographs were
intermittent.

00:20:25,085 --> 00:20:26,487
None included the driver.

00:20:27,822 --> 00:20:28,889
The coffee shop?

00:20:28,956 --> 00:20:30,057
Yep.

00:20:30,124 --> 00:20:34,562
Would you like to, uh,
process the truck?

00:20:34,628 --> 00:20:35,296
Sure.

00:20:35,362 --> 00:20:36,630
Thank you.

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,907
Hi there.

00:20:46,974 --> 00:20:48,242
Can I help you guys?

00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:49,543
Yeah, I'm Nick Stokes.

00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,744
This is Gil Grissom.

00:20:50,811 --> 00:20:52,613
We're with the Vegas Crime Lab.

00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,681
Pete Hutchins.

00:20:53,747 --> 00:20:55,850
Uh, cops are always welcome.

00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,319
Any sandwich,
on the house, guys.

00:20:58,385 --> 00:20:59,620
No, thanks.

00:20:59,687 --> 00:21:01,822
We're here about the murders
at the Buddhist temple

00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:03,157
off Crystal Peak Drive.

00:21:03,224 --> 00:21:04,592
Yeah, I heard about it.

00:21:04,658 --> 00:21:06,694
I heard that, uh, some
of the local business owners

00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:08,796
weren't very happy
with the members of the temple.

00:21:08,863 --> 00:21:10,197
The monks?

00:21:10,264 --> 00:21:12,433
Well, they don't speak English

00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,202
and that bothered
the other customers.

00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:19,340
And it's kind of hard to sell
beer, sandwiches or videos

00:21:19,406 --> 00:21:21,575
when the monks don't partake
in any of those things.

00:21:21,642 --> 00:21:23,844
MAN:
Those monks changed
the whole feel

00:21:23,911 --> 00:21:25,079
of this neighborhood.

00:21:25,146 --> 00:21:27,114
I'm not surprised
at any of these murders.

00:21:27,181 --> 00:21:28,282
Your name is?

00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:29,984
Peter Hutchins, Sr.

00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,751
You know what?
I've owned this
shop for 20 years.

00:21:32,818 --> 00:21:34,520
Suddenly,
these holy robers move in here

00:21:35,047 --> 00:21:36,282
and business takes
a nose-dive.

00:21:36,349 --> 00:21:37,984
And I don't care
what they say

00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,719
it doesn't have
a damn thing to do

00:21:39,786 --> 00:21:41,053
with the economy.

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,441
Good night, Las Vegas;
good morning, Vietnam.

00:21:44,524 --> 00:21:46,325
Uh, Grissom, I found these

00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:48,294
on the front seat.

00:21:51,664 --> 00:21:53,366
Uh, which one
of you two guys

00:21:53,432 --> 00:21:54,901
drives the
truck outside?

00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:55,968
I do.

00:21:56,035 --> 00:21:57,503
Well, these wouldn't be

00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,071
your prayer beads, would they?

00:21:59,138 --> 00:22:00,973
No. Isn't there
a law against her

00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,708
sniffing around
inside my truck?

00:22:02,775 --> 00:22:04,510
She has a warrant.

00:22:04,577 --> 00:22:07,680
STOKES:
Sir, your vehicle was found
in the driveway of the temple

00:22:07,747 --> 00:22:09,715
around the time of the murders.

00:22:09,782 --> 00:22:11,818
Now, why would I go
to a Buddhist temple?

00:22:11,884 --> 00:22:14,053
Probably not looking
for salvation.

00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:21,627
( <i>rock music playing</i> )

00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,047
Jimmy's running late.

00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,682
Nothing changes, huh?

00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,116
Oh, uh...

00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,185

00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:34,520
Aw, you kidding, Catherine?

00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,989
Any day of the week, honey
you can still have them

00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,624
three deep, lined up at the bar.

00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,359
You were always
nice to me, Ted.

00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:42,328
Nice has nothing
to do with it, kid.

00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,797
Let's face it,
you and this CSI stuff...

00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,666
that's where you light up--
you're a natural.

00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,468
Jimmy changed my life.

00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,905
And no funny stuff,
just mentor and pupil.

00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:56,075
Guy delivered me
into a whole new life.

00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,510
Hey! Jimmy!

00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,079
What's the case of the week?

00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:01,881
Guy's up a tree, dead.
Mm-hmm?

00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,749
Ex-wife in the bedroom,
with the pool man

00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,584
both <i>very</i> alive, if
you know what I mean.

00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:07,052
Guy's spying on his ex.

00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,721
Has a heart attack
when he sees her

00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,389
doing the nasty
with the pool man.

00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:12,558
You must have read
the coroner's report.

00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,026
Just my woman's intuition.

00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:17,830
I wish he could have done
the same for Stephanie.

00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,532
Yeah.
TADERO:
Hey, Cath.

00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:20,766

00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,201
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,203
Wish I didn't know.

00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,271
You up for this?

00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:26,372
Ted.

00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:29,141
I'll see you, kid.

00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,947
This is where Stephanie
was found.

00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:41,320
Worst day of my life.

00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,693
Over there is where the
beat cop grabbed Kelso

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,528
as he was running out
into the alley.

00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,830
That's right.

00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,233
Now, do you remember where
you found Kelso's glove?

00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,368
Up there, around the corner
of that dumpster.

00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,537
I figure he'd dropped it,
trying to get away.

00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,706
And then you logged
it into evidence?

00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,107
No sketches, no photos.

00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:04,810
Just brought it in two
days after the murder.

00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:06,245
Yeah.

00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:12,284
Arresting officer never saw
a glove, according to the file.

00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:14,620
He was busy trying
to coral Kelso. It was dark.

00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:16,889
I came back in the daylight.
What's going on?

00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,857
You always used to say

00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:21,760
if something doesn't feel right,
it probably isn't.

00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,329
What do you want?
We got the guy.

00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:26,699
Jimmy, you're not hiding
anything, are you?

00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,437
You didn't try
to make things fit...?

00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,039
I'm going to forget
you ever asked that.

00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,236
I thought so.

00:25:12,807 --> 00:25:14,642
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:25:15,677 --> 00:25:18,513
Lot of activity
in this neighborhood.

00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,515
Guy going the wrong way
on a one-way.

00:25:20,582 --> 00:25:21,950
Fender bender on the corner.

00:25:22,016 --> 00:25:24,119
Some guy running down
the middle of the street...

00:25:24,185 --> 00:25:25,720
Good, we should go
after him, then

00:25:25,787 --> 00:25:28,389
'cause the sandwich man's
going to walk.

00:25:28,456 --> 00:25:30,058
His alibi checks out--
he was in Laughlin

00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:31,559
with his wife
at a farmers market.

00:25:31,626 --> 00:25:33,528
What about the truck?
Took the van.

00:25:33,595 --> 00:25:35,029
Left the truck
in the driveway.

00:25:35,096 --> 00:25:35,864
Junior?

00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,198
Yeah.

00:25:37,265 --> 00:25:39,534
Teenage kid, no parents,
keys to a ride.

00:25:39,601 --> 00:25:41,035
I'm all over him.

00:25:41,102 --> 00:25:43,638
SANDERS:
Results from
the colored material

00:25:43,705 --> 00:25:45,006
found at the crime scene.

00:25:45,073 --> 00:25:46,741
I'm trying to be humble,
but once again

00:25:46,808 --> 00:25:47,909
I have the case breaker.

00:25:53,648 --> 00:25:55,283
You may be right.

00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,620
Paintball paint.

Come on over here, Rambo.

00:26:16,237 --> 00:26:19,073
Wow! One pop
to the chest

00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,542
and you're out.

00:26:20,608 --> 00:26:22,277
You got off easy.

What are you guys
doing here?

00:26:24,145 --> 00:26:25,947
GRISSOM:
Well, we know that
your father's truck

00:26:26,014 --> 00:26:28,483
was at the temple at
the time of the murders.

00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,018
And our lab identified
boot prints

00:26:30,084 --> 00:26:31,586
and paint residue
near the altar.

00:26:31,653 --> 00:26:33,321
HUTCHINS JR.:
What kind of paint?

00:26:33,388 --> 00:26:35,256
Water soluble, with
flecks of plastic coating

00:26:35,323 --> 00:26:36,925
like the kind
on your clothes.

00:26:36,991 --> 00:26:38,526
Toss them in the
wash, paint's gone.

( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:26:49,838 --> 00:26:53,074
I've never been
to the temple.

00:26:53,141 --> 00:26:55,410
Never.

00:26:57,745 --> 00:26:59,848
Well...

00:27:01,683 --> 00:27:03,718
See...

00:27:03,785 --> 00:27:07,388
this says that you were.

00:27:07,455 --> 00:27:09,591
Tell him who you lent
your boots to.

00:27:09,657 --> 00:27:12,093
Tell him, or they'll accuse
you of something else.

00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,895
Nobody else
wears my boots.

We heard that this
place was freaky

that there was a
money tree and drugs.

00:27:23,037 --> 00:27:25,540
We wanted to see
for ourselves.

That's why you found
my boot prints.

00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:36,417
No.

00:27:38,553 --> 00:27:39,988
You see, our dust lifter

00:27:40,054 --> 00:27:43,458
is only effective
on very recent prints.

00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:46,895
I think you were there
the day of the murders.

00:27:53,902 --> 00:27:55,270
It was a...

( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:27:56,805 --> 00:27:59,541
It was a week ago when
I went there with my friends.

00:28:01,976 --> 00:28:04,379
But Tommy, he copped a statue.

00:28:04,446 --> 00:28:08,082
I went back to return it,
and I was removing my boots

00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:10,852
when I looked inside
and I saw them laying there.

00:28:17,425 --> 00:28:19,594
I wanted to call the police,
but I knew

00:28:19,661 --> 00:28:22,330
if they found me there,
they'd think I did it.

00:28:25,567 --> 00:28:28,736
How'd you know
to remove your boots?

00:28:32,474 --> 00:28:34,809
You'd been there before?

00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:38,246
Maybe.

00:28:38,313 --> 00:28:41,216
What are you accusing
my son of now?

00:28:43,151 --> 00:28:45,253
They were my friends.

00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,489
Whoa, whoa.

00:28:47,555 --> 00:28:50,892
Those monks were your friends?

00:28:52,827 --> 00:28:56,164
I'm taking a walk.

( <i>door closes</i> )

00:29:07,642 --> 00:29:10,078
Someone once asked the Buddha

00:29:10,145 --> 00:29:13,982
"How do we escape the heat
of a summer's day?"

00:29:14,048 --> 00:29:16,251
And the Buddha said

00:29:16,317 --> 00:29:20,522
"Why not leap
into a blazing furnace?"

00:29:28,263 --> 00:29:30,899
WILLOWS:
I got your beep.
Did you run those tests?

00:29:30,965 --> 00:29:32,534
Kelso's glove--

00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,403
embedded in the
fabric-- dog hair.

00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,405
I isolated motor oil
on the thumb

00:29:37,472 --> 00:29:40,074
and the rest of the stains
were bloodstains.

00:29:40,141 --> 00:29:42,110
Kelso's, just like
in the report.

00:29:42,177 --> 00:29:44,479
From where he cut himself
stabbing her?

00:29:44,546 --> 00:29:47,882
You'd think, but you kind of
put me on a wild snipe hunt

00:29:47,949 --> 00:29:52,153
so I tested for all biologicals,
and I ran amylase

00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,923
and I found saliva.

00:29:54,989 --> 00:29:57,158
Kelso's saliva?

00:29:57,225 --> 00:29:58,293
Yeah.

00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,627
Well, blood mixed with saliva

00:29:59,694 --> 00:30:00,962
sounds like a mouth injury.

00:30:03,131 --> 00:30:06,000
Did you check the blood
that Ecklie collected

00:30:06,067 --> 00:30:07,068
from the murder weapon?

00:30:07,135 --> 00:30:08,303
Also amylase.

00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:10,905
Well, how did blood
from Kelso's mouth

00:30:10,972 --> 00:30:13,808
end up on the glove
as well as the knife?

00:30:17,512 --> 00:30:20,682
Unless it was planted.

00:30:27,088 --> 00:30:28,556
Jimmy.

00:30:31,192 --> 00:30:34,028
You set him up.
He killed her.

00:30:34,095 --> 00:30:35,964
You don't know that.
Yes, I do.

00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,399
When I stuck her,
she called out your name.

00:30:38,466 --> 00:30:40,869
Where's a cop when you need one?

about things they didn't do,

He had a history of
roughing up girls.

He had a knife
cut on his hand.

But D.A...

00:30:52,347 --> 00:30:54,883
got cold feet,
released him.

Good evidence
doesn't need help.

<i>You</i> taught me that one.

for a sample of your blood.

on the murder weapon.

00:31:29,684 --> 00:31:31,853
It doesn't belong to Kelso.

00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,422
You think I killed Stephanie?

00:31:34,489 --> 00:31:37,125
You were in love
with her, Jimmy.

00:31:37,192 --> 00:31:39,961
That was no secret.

00:31:40,028 --> 00:31:42,063
But the ring was.

00:31:43,298 --> 00:31:44,899
Three karats

00:31:44,966 --> 00:31:47,969
and she turned you down.

00:31:48,036 --> 00:31:49,404
Same week she died.

00:31:49,471 --> 00:31:51,906
I never thought
anything of it till now.

00:31:54,742 --> 00:31:56,878
You're good.

00:31:56,945 --> 00:31:58,713
You are.

00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,648
I'll get a warrant.

00:32:00,715 --> 00:32:01,749
Yeah, you do that.

00:32:03,218 --> 00:32:04,953
You go get a warrant.

00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,101
I'm going to have
to warn you

00:32:13,101 --> 00:32:15,704
any food I find in the gum
is not going to be unique.

00:32:15,771 --> 00:32:17,005
Why don't you
just give me

00:32:17,072 --> 00:32:18,273
a suspect
I can match to?

00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,375
I can't give you
what I don't have, Greg.

00:32:20,442 --> 00:32:23,934
All we're going to have is
what we get from this gum.

00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:28,018
All right, then I guess it's
slice and dice.

00:32:28,018 --> 00:32:30,020
Thank you.

00:32:40,698 --> 00:32:46,370
Results on
Jimmy Tadero's sample.

00:32:46,437 --> 00:32:49,039
I just got it back from DNA.

00:32:52,042 --> 00:32:54,144
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:32:55,646 --> 00:32:57,214
Not going to take a look at it?

00:32:59,216 --> 00:33:01,752
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:33:04,989 --> 00:33:08,893
There was a shooting one night
in the club

00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:11,462
and Jimmy pulls out
his revolver

00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:13,931
and takes down the bad guy.

00:33:13,998 --> 00:33:16,433
The guy's on the floor, dying.

00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,804
Even though this was 15 years
ago, we still knew about AIDS.

00:33:23,207 --> 00:33:25,142
Jimmy then puts his gun away,
he leans down--

00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:26,977
he starts giving this guy
mouth-to-mouth

00:33:27,044 --> 00:33:30,214
after having just shot him.

00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:35,886
Forget his own life, he's going
to bring this guy back.

00:33:35,953 --> 00:33:39,490
And he did.

00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,632
You want me to open it?

00:33:48,699 --> 00:33:52,136
( <i>sighs heavily</i> )

00:34:06,317 --> 00:34:08,152
( <i>laughter</i> )

00:34:28,672 --> 00:34:31,242
You've been excluded
on the murder weapon.

00:34:31,308 --> 00:34:32,710
I could have
told you that.

00:34:32,776 --> 00:34:35,212
Did you compare the unknown
against the club owner, Ted?

00:34:35,279 --> 00:34:36,680
Yeah, I compared it to Ted.

00:34:36,747 --> 00:34:38,649
I compared it
to every male in CODIS.

00:34:38,716 --> 00:34:40,651
There were no hits, nowhere.

00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,022
Have a seat, Jimmy.

00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:54,285
I screwed up--
you want to hear me say it?

00:34:54,352 --> 00:34:55,620
I liked Kelso.

00:34:55,686 --> 00:34:56,788
Maybe I was wrong.

00:34:56,854 --> 00:34:59,390
Yeah, you were.

00:34:59,457 --> 00:35:02,260
So now what?

00:35:04,028 --> 00:35:05,963
You know now what.

00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,515
You're not serious.

00:35:07,581 --> 00:35:09,917
You put a man away for life
on planted evidence, Jimmy.

00:35:09,984 --> 00:35:12,119
He was a scumbag.
He copped to another murder.

00:35:12,186 --> 00:35:14,388
Scumbag or saint,
what you did is a capital crime.

00:35:14,455 --> 00:35:16,824
You can't play with evidence,
especially in a murder.

00:35:16,891 --> 00:35:19,360
I can get life in prison if you
turn me in, do you know that?

00:35:19,426 --> 00:35:20,494
Maybe even the death penalty.

00:35:20,561 --> 00:35:21,562
Do you know that?!

00:35:21,629 --> 00:35:22,797
What do you want me to do?

00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,498
What do you
want me to do?

00:35:25,565 --> 00:35:26,454
Do you want me to look
the other way?

00:35:26,454 --> 00:35:27,889
Do you want me to dummy
my report?

00:35:27,955 --> 00:35:29,490
I can't believe
you're doing this to me.

00:35:29,557 --> 00:35:30,491
I gave you your career.

00:35:30,558 --> 00:35:31,626
I earned my career

00:35:31,693 --> 00:35:33,027
and you did this to yourself.

00:35:33,094 --> 00:35:34,529
You fabricated evidence, Jimmy.

00:35:34,595 --> 00:35:36,331
You were two steps away
from turning tricks.

00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,533
This is the thanks I get?

00:35:43,437 --> 00:35:47,007
I danced, period.

00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:51,178
And instead of feeling
sorry for yourself

00:35:51,244 --> 00:35:52,412
think about this.

00:35:52,479 --> 00:35:53,920
When you were out there
planting evidence

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,170
on a case
that you couldn't break

00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,839
Stephanie's real killer
got away.

00:35:56,906 --> 00:36:00,142
And he's still out there

00:36:01,504 --> 00:36:04,640
because you sold
the one thing a cop

00:36:04,707 --> 00:36:06,528
can't afford to sell:
your integrity.

00:36:06,594 --> 00:36:08,530
So you tell me,
between the two of us

00:36:08,596 --> 00:36:10,198
who's the whore?

00:36:14,435 --> 00:36:16,938
Arrest him.

00:36:29,914 --> 00:36:31,182
You can hate me
all you want.

00:36:31,249 --> 00:36:32,817
I'm going to see you
through this.

00:36:53,972 --> 00:36:55,974
If you see the Buddha

00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,076
on the side of the road,
kill him.

00:36:58,143 --> 00:37:00,445
Because the true Buddha
is inside of us

00:37:00,512 --> 00:37:02,180
so that is the false Buddha

00:37:02,247 --> 00:37:04,315
or a tired monk
who doesn't drive

00:37:04,382 --> 00:37:06,818
because he can't control
his anger.

00:37:06,885 --> 00:37:09,754
Climb in, I'll
give you a lift.

00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:20,365
We've cleared the father.

00:37:20,431 --> 00:37:22,867
The son has
also been cleared.

00:37:22,934 --> 00:37:25,270
And you're looking
for my help.

00:37:26,671 --> 00:37:29,812
You know my religion better
than I know your science.

00:37:30,761 --> 00:37:32,095
There was a gang placa

00:37:32,162 --> 00:37:34,303
that was scrawled into
the walls of your temple.

00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:36,105
It was put there
to mislead us.

00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:38,307
The weapon we found
on your desk

00:37:38,374 --> 00:37:40,643
was also put there
to mislead us.

00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:43,245
The only other unexplained
evidence we have

00:37:43,312 --> 00:37:45,381
is the chewing gum.

00:37:45,448 --> 00:37:48,517
We found traces of
curry and saffron.

00:37:48,584 --> 00:37:52,788
Somebody ate a meal,
then chewed gum.

00:37:52,855 --> 00:37:54,290
Sometimes the best
evidence we get

00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:56,626
comes from what people do
when they're not thinking.

00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:59,195
Old habits, routines.

00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:04,393
I don't think the gum was
put there to mislead us.

00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,229
I think it was just a mistake.

00:38:06,295 --> 00:38:09,065
And you want to know
what I eat for dinner.

00:38:10,633 --> 00:38:13,469
Curry and saffron.

00:38:15,271 --> 00:38:16,973
It's the real stuff.

00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:19,942
The neighborhood kids
thought we imported drugs.

00:38:20,009 --> 00:38:22,912
We just imported spices.

00:38:22,979 --> 00:38:26,115
And the five of you
ate together that night?

00:38:26,182 --> 00:38:27,917
Any guests?

00:38:27,984 --> 00:38:29,919
No.

00:38:29,986 --> 00:38:32,054
How come you don't leave
your cell phone on?

00:38:32,121 --> 00:38:33,723
We're in a temple, O'Riley.

00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:35,525
Oh, sorry.

00:38:35,591 --> 00:38:37,030
I just left the bank.

00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:40,166
Mr. Ananda here,
you're playing fast and loose

00:38:40,233 --> 00:38:41,534
with the school
fund money.

00:38:41,601 --> 00:38:43,236
He raised just
over $13,000

00:38:43,303 --> 00:38:45,205
for the school fund

00:38:45,271 --> 00:38:47,574
but you only deposited $12,000.

00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,309
You planning any more

00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:50,910
trips to Disneyland?

00:38:50,977 --> 00:38:52,078
According to the bank

00:38:52,145 --> 00:38:54,981
you opened the school fund
account on the same day

00:38:55,048 --> 00:38:56,483
as the murders.

00:38:56,549 --> 00:38:58,585
Where did you have
the money before that?

00:38:58,651 --> 00:39:01,087
In a box in my office.

00:39:12,565 --> 00:39:14,434
Curry powder.

00:39:16,569 --> 00:39:19,405
Your temple employs
a part-time cook.

00:39:19,472 --> 00:39:21,207
Mr. Suddahara moved on.

00:39:21,274 --> 00:39:23,710
After you caught him
with his hand in the till?

00:39:34,254 --> 00:39:36,856
Why didn't you tell us
about Mr. Suddahara before?

00:39:36,923 --> 00:39:40,593
Because a man steals
doesn't mean he also kills.

00:39:46,699 --> 00:39:50,370
Got any more of that
gum, Mr. Suddahara?

00:39:50,436 --> 00:39:52,939
Fresh out.

00:39:54,974 --> 00:39:57,076
( <i>door opens</i> )

00:39:57,143 --> 00:40:01,247
Yep, his DNA matches
the gum sample.

00:40:04,072 --> 00:40:06,197
You thought Ananda was going
to report you to the police

00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:07,732
for stealing
the money.

00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:08,900
Went home, got his rifle

00:40:08,967 --> 00:40:11,489
came back to make sure
he didn't talk.

00:40:11,489 --> 00:40:12,557
And he'd gone
to the bank

00:40:12,624 --> 00:40:13,858
to protect the rest
of the money

00:40:13,925 --> 00:40:15,426
but you didn't know that.

00:40:15,493 --> 00:40:16,895
Where is he?
( <i>chanting</i> )

00:40:16,961 --> 00:40:18,663
Did he go to the cops
already?

00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,266
If they ask what I look like

00:40:21,332 --> 00:40:22,467
here's your answer.

00:40:22,534 --> 00:40:23,868
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:26,804
I'm curious about
one thing, though.

00:40:26,871 --> 00:40:31,776
Why did you shoot them all
in their sixth chakra?

00:40:31,843 --> 00:40:35,346
I shot them
between the eyes.
