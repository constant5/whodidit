00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,971
( <i>crowd cheering</i> )

00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:24,152
What are you waiting for?
Call it!

00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:25,375
( <i>blows whistle</i> )

00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,750
Come on, come on.
Coming through.

00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:39,852
Let me have a look.

00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,085
Okay, you're out.

00:00:42,152 --> 00:00:43,792
Myles will move in
from the second line.

00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:45,500
Forget about Myles,
I'm going back in.

00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,166
Stitch me.

00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,167
Terry, will you relax?

00:00:47,234 --> 00:00:49,625
It's a weekend league,
it's not the NHL.

00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:50,559
It is to me.

00:00:50,626 --> 00:00:52,161
You're not 100%.

00:00:52,228 --> 00:00:53,166
What are you,
a doctor or a coach?

00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,200
Do me a favor, stitch.

00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:02,542
Come on.

00:01:40,581 --> 00:01:43,050
( <i>whistles blow</i> )

00:01:54,996 --> 00:01:56,430
Get the doc.

00:02:04,272 --> 00:02:05,673
Where's the body?

00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,275
On the bench--
he was moved there

00:02:07,341 --> 00:02:09,210
after he collapsed
in front of the net.

00:02:09,277 --> 00:02:10,878
Apparently, uh

00:02:10,945 --> 00:02:12,380
the guy was
responsive enough

00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:13,714
to be helped
off the ice.

00:02:13,781 --> 00:02:16,284
He died a few
minutes later.

00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:35,636
This looks fresh.
Well, according

00:02:35,703 --> 00:02:37,905
to the on-site doctor,
he took one across the cheek

00:02:37,972 --> 00:02:39,373
earlier in the second period.

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,609
Well, I guess this must be

00:02:41,676 --> 00:02:43,444
from the third period.

00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:45,112
Looks like that
other team

00:02:45,179 --> 00:02:47,048
worked him over pretty good.

00:02:47,114 --> 00:02:48,950
Hockey, rough game.

00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:51,185

Ten minutes,
unsportsmanlike conduct.

Boys will be boys.

00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:34,741
Yeah, sounds like these
boys went to a fight

00:03:34,808 --> 00:03:36,042
and a hockey game
broke out.

00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:37,544
You just don't like sports.

00:03:37,611 --> 00:03:40,046
That's not true-- I've been
a baseball fan my whole life.

00:03:40,113 --> 00:03:42,949
Baseball.
Well, that figures.
All those stats.

00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:44,284
It's a beautiful game.

00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:46,353
Since when are you
interested in beauty?

00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:47,988
Since I met you.

00:03:49,756 --> 00:03:51,224
So, we'll start at
the opposite goal

00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:54,327
work our way across
the blue line to center ice.

00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:57,330
Sure.

00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,418
It's not much to go on.

00:05:25,485 --> 00:05:28,254
Maybe we should be
looking off the ice.

00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,524
( <i>engine purring</i> )

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,532
So, why did you
move the body?

00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:40,933
You ever tried
treating someone

00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,568
on the ice wearing just
street shoes?

00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:44,304
Then Mr. Rivers was still
breathing?

00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,639
When I brought him back
to the bench, yes.

00:05:46,706 --> 00:05:49,142
Then I performed CPR,
and he didn't respond.

00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,911
Did you also do the stitch work?

00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,915
I'm the on-site doctor
for this facility.

00:05:55,982 --> 00:05:57,817
The stitches held,
and I advised Terry

00:05:57,884 --> 00:05:59,819
not to go back on the ice.

00:05:59,886 --> 00:06:02,922
So, if he'd listened,
he'd still be alive.

00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:08,561
What do these
guys play for?

00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:09,562
A little money?

00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:10,249
Imitation

00:06:10,249 --> 00:06:11,792
Stanley Cup?

00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:13,394
We play for
the pride of it.

00:06:15,696 --> 00:06:17,598
And the joy of kicking ass.

00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:18,851
You are...?

00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:20,887
Tommy Sconzo.

00:06:20,953 --> 00:06:22,688
Right wing, first line.

00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:24,056
Hitting's part
of the game.

00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:25,993
Take away the
physical aspect

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,661
you've got figure skating.

00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:29,897
Guys out there doing
triple lutzes.

00:06:29,964 --> 00:06:31,399
Is that how you lost the, uh...?

00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:34,969
The sit spin?
Second period,
number nine.

00:06:35,036 --> 00:06:36,137
The guy's a real McCracken.

00:06:36,203 --> 00:06:38,172
Which means?
He gave me a high
stick to the mouth.

00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:39,740
That's why my guys crashed
the goalie.

00:06:39,807 --> 00:06:40,975
An eye for an eye, you know?

00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:43,077
That why your guy ended up dead?

00:06:47,748 --> 00:06:49,250
What can I tell you, lady?

00:06:49,316 --> 00:06:51,085
It all happened so fast,
you know?

00:06:51,152 --> 00:06:53,454

00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,708
We all do.

00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:51,469
The thing I love about Zambonis

00:07:51,536 --> 00:07:53,504
is they pick up everything.

00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,559
Hey.

00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,562
Yeah?

00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:01,264
I'm afraid the other part
of this tooth might be in there.

Time to combine
Foyeer's Law of Conduction

00:08:06,837 --> 00:08:08,872

I'd estimate...

100 cubic feet.

at 90 degrees, but
the variables are
constantly changing.

00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:33,697
Let's ballpark it.

00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:37,567
I don't know, 50-cubic-foot
melt per hour, if we're lucky?

00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:40,070
120 minutes for a tooth...

00:08:40,137 --> 00:08:41,605
the whole tooth...

00:08:41,672 --> 00:08:44,675
and nothing
but the tooth.

Yup.

See if I can get this back
to Gregor at the lab.

00:11:13,962 --> 00:11:15,597
He could tell us
what we're dealing with.

00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:20,635
Two coasters, one glass?

00:11:20,702 --> 00:11:21,836
What do you think?

00:11:21,903 --> 00:11:24,205
Our guy was having a little
party with the waitress?

00:11:24,272 --> 00:11:25,807
She was just coming
on shift.

00:11:25,874 --> 00:11:27,842
She came through me.
Already cleared her.

00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:30,345

was here...

00:11:30,412 --> 00:11:31,346
grabbed the stuff

Hey, how's he doing?
Whoa, whoa...

00:11:53,635 --> 00:11:55,070
Miss, you can't come in here.
Why not?

00:11:55,136 --> 00:11:56,338
I'm sorry, he's dead.

00:11:56,404 --> 00:11:57,906
He's dead?
What are you talking about?

00:11:57,973 --> 00:11:59,441
They told me he wasn't
feeling well.

00:11:59,507 --> 00:12:01,810
He was backing
me up an hour ago.

00:12:01,876 --> 00:12:03,712
What happened to him?
Miss...

00:12:03,778 --> 00:12:05,647
Why don't we step outside
for a minute?

00:12:16,992 --> 00:12:19,094
What took you so long?

00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,929
I was watching
ice melt.

00:12:20,996 --> 00:12:22,297
Tox screen
came up empty

00:12:22,364 --> 00:12:23,465
Except for quinine.

00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:25,834
Must have had malaria
in the past six months.

00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,835
Either that

00:12:26,901 --> 00:12:28,670
or he's a big
gin and tonic drinker.

00:12:28,737 --> 00:12:30,305
I've ordered up his
medical records.

00:12:30,372 --> 00:12:32,307
If I was this guy

00:12:32,374 --> 00:12:34,075
I'd have been
popping pain pills.

00:12:34,142 --> 00:12:36,411
Hairline fracture
of the ulna

00:12:36,478 --> 00:12:37,579
bruised kidney

00:12:37,646 --> 00:12:39,347
ten stitches off
the orbital bone

00:12:39,414 --> 00:12:41,483
fractured nasal bone,
all recent.

00:12:42,751 --> 00:12:44,686
Healed rib fractures.

00:12:44,753 --> 00:12:47,222
He should have worn a cage.

00:12:51,126 --> 00:12:53,094
I bet he was proud of every

00:12:53,161 --> 00:12:55,363
last battle scar.

00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,299
What is it
about organized sports?

00:12:57,365 --> 00:12:58,500
Well, organized sports is

00:12:58,566 --> 00:13:00,335
the paradigmatic model
of a just society.

00:13:00,402 --> 00:13:02,971
Everyone knows the same language
everyone knows the rules.

00:13:03,038 --> 00:13:05,640
And there's a specific
punishment handed out

00:13:05,707 --> 00:13:07,742
the moment someone tries
to cheat.

00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:08,843
Instant morality.

00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,546
So, uh, what did this guy do
in real life?

00:13:11,613 --> 00:13:13,748
Stockbroker.

00:13:13,815 --> 00:13:15,517
Competition junky.

00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,851
Aren't we all?

00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:17,952
Not me, not anymore.

00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:19,020
No?

00:13:19,087 --> 00:13:21,056
How'd you get to be
chief medical examiner?

00:13:21,122 --> 00:13:22,657
Look, we're all carrying

00:13:22,724 --> 00:13:24,826
prehistoric genes
in a postmodern world.

00:13:24,893 --> 00:13:26,895
We get our meat
from the grocery store

00:13:26,962 --> 00:13:28,663
instead of with a club
or a knife.

00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,433
We have to work off our,
uh, testosterone somehow.

00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:32,708
Foibles of youth.

00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:33,959
Yeah.

00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:36,041
So, cause of death?

00:13:36,805 --> 00:13:38,306
Not sure.

00:13:38,373 --> 00:13:39,741
This cut

00:13:39,808 --> 00:13:41,009
nicked his carotid.

00:13:41,076 --> 00:13:44,045
Double-edged, clean blade,
hockey skate, uh...

00:13:44,112 --> 00:13:45,981
<i>could have killed him.</i>

00:13:46,047 --> 00:13:47,125
Fun continues.

00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,208
Basilar artery
also suffered

00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,500
significant trauma.

00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,834
Evidence of blood
in the intimal space.

00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:55,417
Possibly enough
to cause syncope.

00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,708
Loss of consciousness.

00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,083
Well, it could explain

00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:01,096
why the vic ended up
in the bottom of that pile.

00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:05,700
So did his death cause his fall

00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:07,802
or did his fall cause his death?

00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:14,406
What'd you get from Area 51?

00:14:14,473 --> 00:14:15,975
Terry Rivers was
an instigator.

00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,509
Always stirring
the pot.

00:14:17,576 --> 00:14:19,111
Every fire needs a match.

00:14:19,178 --> 00:14:21,547
So, I guess this is
their equipment?

00:14:21,614 --> 00:14:22,915
Yeah, down to
the last stick.

00:14:22,982 --> 00:14:24,583
Here's a copy of
the team roster.

00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,618
Okay.

00:14:25,684 --> 00:14:27,346
See you later.
Okay.

00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:32,525
Ms. Gallagher?

00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:33,526
Yeah.

00:14:33,592 --> 00:14:34,960
Catherine Willows

00:14:35,027 --> 00:14:35,961
Crime Lab.

00:14:36,028 --> 00:14:37,963
I understand you play
for Area 51.

00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,199
Did you see much ice time
during the game?

00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:41,600
No, they just
let me take off

00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:43,669
my cheerleader uniform
and warm the bench.

00:14:43,736 --> 00:14:46,639
You know what?
Been there, done that.

00:14:46,705 --> 00:14:47,907
Just asking
a question here.

00:14:47,973 --> 00:14:50,242
I played 24 minutes,
12 seconds--

00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:51,944
about my season
average.

00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:53,512
I also lead the team
in assists.

00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:56,549
Oh... you've got
good peripheral vision.

00:14:56,615 --> 00:14:57,917
You see the ice
really well.

00:14:57,983 --> 00:14:59,818
I didn't see what
happened to Terry.

00:14:59,885 --> 00:15:01,086
You're a real teammate.

00:15:01,153 --> 00:15:03,722
Down the line,
just one of the guys.

00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:06,158
You're looking
in the wrong direction.

00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:07,660
Now, we may have
disliked Terry

00:15:07,726 --> 00:15:09,495
but his own teammates...

00:15:09,562 --> 00:15:11,830
hated him.

00:15:11,897 --> 00:15:13,999
Any reason why?

00:15:14,066 --> 00:15:16,535
How would I know?
I'm just a girl.

00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,038
Can I go now?

00:15:24,343 --> 00:15:26,612
Nice bike.

00:15:37,723 --> 00:15:39,258
( <i>Nick clears throat</i> )

00:15:39,325 --> 00:15:42,761
Just getting into the mind
of a potential killer.

00:15:42,828 --> 00:15:43,963
Potential killer?

00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:46,198
Why don't you just
catch us up there, boss?

00:15:46,265 --> 00:15:48,434
In a minute.

00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,070
First things first--
your contact lens

00:15:51,136 --> 00:15:52,705
was worn by
a near-sighted person.

00:15:52,771 --> 00:15:54,773
And since I was born
with perfect eyesight

00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,141
I'm experimenting with what

00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,667
it would feel like
to be near-sighted.

00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:59,291
Don't tell us
you're wearing
our evidence.

00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,114
STOKES:
Come on, Greg.

00:16:02,181 --> 00:16:03,649
Give me some credit.

00:16:03,716 --> 00:16:08,020
Borrowing a pair
of lenses from
Archie in A/V.

00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:10,990
Giving me a headache, though.

00:16:15,794 --> 00:16:18,163
Mannitol-- that's
that baby laxative

00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,899
used to cut heroin with.

00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:21,375
China White?
You sure?

00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,436
The GCMS does not kid around.

00:16:24,503 --> 00:16:26,208
West coast heroin
is Mexican Brown.

00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,542
20, 30% pure, tops.

00:16:28,542 --> 00:16:30,811
What's China White, 75%?

00:16:30,878 --> 00:16:31,945
Uh, your sample's 91.

00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:37,000
91%? No wonder the guy O.D.'d.

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,959
That's a death sentence.

00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:39,260
Doesn't make any sense, man.

00:16:39,327 --> 00:16:41,896
The money from
dealing heroin comes
from the cutting.

00:16:41,963 --> 00:16:44,098
The more you cut,
the more money you make.

00:16:44,165 --> 00:16:46,934
There's no profit
margin in selling
stuff that's too pure.

00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:50,071
Unless you're looking
to kill someone.

00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:55,195
So, this is what being
a stockbroker buys you.

00:17:01,301 --> 00:17:04,404
( <i>sighs</i> ):
Hmm, well.

00:17:04,471 --> 00:17:07,541
How do men live like this?

00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:10,110
What's wrong with it?

00:17:10,177 --> 00:17:12,542
Well, it's a cave

00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:14,166
with hardwood floors.

00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:16,500
It's clean.

00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Television, couch.
What else does a guy need?

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,768
Well, how about
a plant?

00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:27,071
Anything to makes it
a little more... human.

00:17:27,138 --> 00:17:30,708
I mean, it doesn't seem
like this guy had any...

00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:32,443
connection to anybody.

00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:36,979
I don't know about that.

00:17:54,196 --> 00:17:56,164
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:17:56,231 --> 00:18:00,375
It's never a good sign
when the number of women

00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,583
a guy sleeps with is greater

00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,917
than the number
of chairs he owns.

00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,619
So, what's the ratio here?

00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:11,187
Well, uh, ballparking it,
I'd say...

00:18:11,254 --> 00:18:14,959
four women to every one piece
of furniture he owns

00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:16,583
including the TV.

00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,310
( <i>sighs</i> ):
So...

00:18:21,377 --> 00:18:25,083
I guess our guy is
about three things--

00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,884
pucks, bucks, and...

00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,654
chicks.

00:18:29,721 --> 00:18:32,824
Well, we still don't know
how or why he died.

00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,660
Well, we know how he lived.

00:18:40,198 --> 00:18:41,132
Any blood?

00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:42,133
Take your pick.

00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,268
Testing for blood
on a hockey jersey

00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:47,572
it's like handing out
jaywalking tickets
at a marathon.

00:18:47,638 --> 00:18:49,874
Well, speaking
on a meta-level...

00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:52,677
Isn't it obvious?

00:18:52,744 --> 00:18:55,113
The overbearing
patriarchal structure

00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:57,548
of modern organized
sports represents

00:18:57,615 --> 00:19:00,718
a socially palatable
sublimation of what
Jung refers to

00:19:00,785 --> 00:19:02,954
as the "shadows
of the unconscious."

00:19:03,021 --> 00:19:04,889
You sucked
at team sports, huh?

00:19:04,956 --> 00:19:07,592
I was captain of
the high school
chess squad.

00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:11,896
Chess is not
a sport, Greg.

00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:18,603
Then why is there
a world chess champion?

00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:22,073
I think sports are
physical by definition.

00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,676
Well, sex is physical.

00:19:24,742 --> 00:19:25,910
Is that a sport?

00:19:25,977 --> 00:19:27,545
Not to me.

00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,118
These blades skated

00:19:34,185 --> 00:19:36,387
through the blood pool.

00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:50,702
Blood spatter.

00:19:50,768 --> 00:19:52,870
Good guess--
this is the one

00:19:52,937 --> 00:19:55,106
that did the damage.

00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:57,241
You know, I had
a roommate in college

00:19:57,308 --> 00:19:59,877
freshman year, from Edmonton,
went on to play

00:19:59,944 --> 00:20:01,245
for the Swedish
Elite League.

00:20:01,312 --> 00:20:02,480
Anyways, he set his blade

00:20:02,547 --> 00:20:03,881
at half an inch, tops.

00:20:03,948 --> 00:20:07,485
And I should know, because
he made me get them sharpened.

00:20:07,552 --> 00:20:09,954
These blades are probably
set at a quarter of an inch.

00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:13,324
GREG:
<i>Well, that's as sharp</i>
<i>as it gets.</i>

00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:14,692
It's a tough blade
to skate on.

00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:16,227
We're talking
Wayne Gretzky style.

00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:18,062
And deadly in a fight.

00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,042
Yeah, that victim was
out of L.A.

00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:32,777
and I don't think
the singer, Lillie

00:20:32,844 --> 00:20:35,413
met him before last night,
so she may be in the clear.

00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,683
Sure you don't want to start
in the dressing room?

00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,151
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Right...

00:20:40,218 --> 00:20:43,087
like you're going
to take Dumpster duty alone.

00:20:43,154 --> 00:20:45,289
Hey, just 'cause I've been
on a personal losing streak

00:20:45,356 --> 00:20:47,258
with the ladies doesn't mean
you should be, too.

00:20:47,325 --> 00:20:49,027
Man, I don't even know

00:20:49,093 --> 00:20:50,395
if I'm going to go there.

00:20:50,461 --> 00:20:52,830
The odds haven't gone my way
in a <i>long</i> time.

00:20:52,897 --> 00:20:55,400
I'm talking about chicks,
not gambling.

00:20:55,466 --> 00:20:56,501
Same difference.

00:20:58,069 --> 00:21:00,304
Mind if I go
for her, then?

00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:15,687
Warrick.

00:21:28,032 --> 00:21:29,834
LILLIE:
<i>It's mine--</i>

00:21:29,901 --> 00:21:31,836
but anybody could have
lifted this scarf

00:21:31,903 --> 00:21:32,970
from my dressing room.

00:21:33,037 --> 00:21:36,240
It's still yours.

00:21:36,307 --> 00:21:38,009
You trying to pin this
on me, now?

00:21:38,076 --> 00:21:40,044
We're just doing
our jobs here.

00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:42,180
Well, did you find
my fingerprints on anything?

00:21:42,246 --> 00:21:43,125
We won't know
till we print you.

00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:47,118
Oh, I'm not worried.
What you see is what you get.

00:21:51,055 --> 00:21:52,390
You're putting words
in my mouth.

00:21:52,457 --> 00:21:54,325
You said everybody hated
him-- now we know why.

00:21:54,392 --> 00:21:56,861
GRISSOM:
We opened up
Terry's hard drive.

00:21:56,928 --> 00:21:58,763
It turns out he had
your entire roster

00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,365
knee-deep in the stock market.

00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:02,066
I don't play for the rat pack.

00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:03,067
SIDLE:
Not now...

00:22:03,134 --> 00:22:04,602
but you used to.

00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:07,071
Okay, so I changed teams.
Big deal. I wanted to win.

00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:09,007
BRASS:
The fact that Terry Rivers
churned and burned

00:22:09,073 --> 00:22:10,742
your brokerage account
out of ten grand

00:22:10,808 --> 00:22:12,043
that didn't enter into it?

00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,144
Terry was a stockbroker.

00:22:13,211 --> 00:22:15,346
He did really well for himself--
Rolex, Beemer.

00:22:15,413 --> 00:22:16,981
He said he could
do the same for me.

00:22:17,048 --> 00:22:17,982
I gave him some money.

00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:19,517
If I wasn't willing
to take a risk

00:22:19,584 --> 00:22:20,685
I'd have put it
in a bank.

00:22:20,752 --> 00:22:22,186
You weren't the only one,
were you?

00:22:22,253 --> 00:22:24,455
No. All the guys
had money with him.

00:22:24,522 --> 00:22:26,524
I mean, Terry
was a salesman.

00:22:26,591 --> 00:22:28,493
You listened to him
talk for five minutes

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,761
and your hair was on fire.

00:22:29,827 --> 00:22:31,029
Ms. Gallagher,
your skate

00:22:31,095 --> 00:22:32,697
had a certain
blood spatter on it.

00:22:32,764 --> 00:22:34,298
It indicates that you're the one

00:22:34,365 --> 00:22:35,633
that nicked Terry River's

00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,968
carotid artery.

00:22:37,035 --> 00:22:38,569
Look, it was pileup.

00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:42,206
<i>Everything was a blur.</i>

00:22:42,273 --> 00:22:43,775
That's ten guys with blades on.

00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:45,710
Hey, I was just looking out
for myself.

00:22:45,777 --> 00:22:47,078
He was a stationary target.

00:22:47,145 --> 00:22:48,379
Terry was on the bottom

00:22:48,446 --> 00:22:49,447
of all those bodies.

00:22:49,514 --> 00:22:50,581
Like you said

00:22:50,648 --> 00:22:52,083
nobody saw anything.
Including

00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,385
your skate intentionally
coming down on his neck.

00:22:54,452 --> 00:22:56,054
Oh, God.

00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,655
( <i>vomiting</i> )

00:22:57,722 --> 00:22:59,257
SIDLE:
You okay?

00:22:59,324 --> 00:23:01,125
You all right?

00:23:01,192 --> 00:23:04,495
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
I knew I shouldn't have had
that shrimp salad

00:23:04,562 --> 00:23:05,797
for dinner last night.

00:23:05,863 --> 00:23:07,799
If you'll excuse me

00:23:07,865 --> 00:23:11,636
I'll get that
cleaned up.

00:23:14,605 --> 00:23:16,474
Wait, you're not going to...

00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,176
What are you doing?

00:23:18,242 --> 00:23:20,211
It's evidence.

00:23:20,278 --> 00:23:21,379
Food poisoning

00:23:21,446 --> 00:23:23,614
especially anything
with spoiled mayonnaise

00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:25,249
can induce vomiting
within 15 minutes.

00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:29,921
She said last night--
that was 12 hours ago.

00:23:36,847 --> 00:23:38,882
She's a liar, and a mother.

00:23:38,949 --> 00:23:40,350
Morning sickness?

00:23:40,417 --> 00:23:41,618
Yep.

00:23:41,685 --> 00:23:43,053
And you know this how?

00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:45,655
Well, first I tested for
the presence of shellfish--

00:23:45,722 --> 00:23:46,723
crustacean free.

00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,491
And then I figured
if she's hiding that

00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:49,659
what else is she hiding?

00:23:49,726 --> 00:23:51,695
Little lie, big lie.

00:23:51,761 --> 00:23:53,396
There was blood in the sample.

00:23:53,463 --> 00:23:55,198
Not uncommon
in early pregnancy.

00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:56,909
Women get mucosal tears

00:23:56,976 --> 00:23:59,445
in their esophagus
because they yak so much.

00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,834
So, I tested the blood

00:24:01,901 --> 00:24:04,771
for the presence of human
choriogonadotropins.

00:24:04,837 --> 00:24:06,806
She is definitely with child.

00:24:06,873 --> 00:24:08,908
She wasn't showing.
She's skinny as a rail.

00:24:08,975 --> 00:24:10,343
But...

00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,792
still, why lie about it?

00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:13,928
Maybe she didn't know
she was pregnant.

00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,130
If she had, would she
have gone out on the ice?

00:24:16,196 --> 00:24:17,965
I wonder if
she would know

00:24:18,032 --> 00:24:20,034
who the father
is... or was.

00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,635
Well, if it was Terry Rivers

00:24:21,702 --> 00:24:23,871
he was definitely
deadbeat dad material.

00:24:23,938 --> 00:24:25,206
Which speaks to motive.

00:24:25,272 --> 00:24:27,441
It's enough to
get us a warrant.

00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,343
Except you can't
safely test for paternity

00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,444
before the baby's born.

00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,846
We could search Jane
Gallagher's apartment.

00:24:32,913 --> 00:24:35,783
See if Terry Rivers might
have left anything behind.

00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:39,286
Yeah. Say goodbye to Greg.

00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:41,655
Bye, Greg.

00:24:43,157 --> 00:24:45,593
STOKES:
I've got twins here, Bill--
one set of prints

00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,228
from your work card;
another set

00:24:47,294 --> 00:24:50,349
from the drug paraphernalia
we found in the Dumpster.

00:24:50,349 --> 00:24:52,085
Look, what can I say?

00:24:52,151 --> 00:24:53,419
He's got a son.

00:24:53,486 --> 00:24:54,887
Well, that's fine.

00:24:54,954 --> 00:24:56,255
That's not
the issue.

00:24:56,322 --> 00:24:58,057
You tampered with the evidence.

00:24:58,124 --> 00:24:59,325
He's eight years old.

00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:02,495
I didn't want Stan's son to hear
that he died in a lounge.

00:25:02,562 --> 00:25:04,063
Foam coming out of his mouth

00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,064
a needle in his arm.

00:25:05,131 --> 00:25:06,432
That's too much for a boy.

00:25:06,499 --> 00:25:07,834
Yeah, but you
got him the gig.

00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,069
You didn't know he was a junkie?

00:25:10,136 --> 00:25:11,871
So am I.

00:25:11,938 --> 00:25:13,072
Former.

00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:14,741
Hell, we met in A.A.

00:25:14,807 --> 00:25:16,309
I thought he was clean.

00:25:16,376 --> 00:25:18,478
I got my fourth birthday
coming up.

00:25:18,544 --> 00:25:20,513
Could have lost your job.

00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,348
Besides, Lillie's going places.

00:25:22,415 --> 00:25:24,183
You know, she's on her way up.

00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,319
I want to be along
for the ride.

00:25:26,386 --> 00:25:30,223
So, you cleaned him up,
threw away his works...

00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:31,858
Why Lillie's scarf?

00:25:31,924 --> 00:25:33,793
I grabbed the first thing
I could find.

00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,028
Lillie's scarf was there?

00:25:35,094 --> 00:25:36,963
Yeah.
Really?

00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,664
You mind rolling up
your sleeves for us?

00:25:38,731 --> 00:25:40,400
( <i>laughs softly</i> )

00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:51,778
I've always had good veins.

00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:54,080
Yeah, okay.

00:25:55,948 --> 00:25:57,283
Thanks.

00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,653
Hey, one more thing, Bill.

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,988
You wear contacts?

00:26:02,055 --> 00:26:03,056
Not anymore.

00:26:03,122 --> 00:26:04,323
Lasik surgery.

00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,725
How's that working out for you?

00:26:05,792 --> 00:26:06,726
Great.

00:26:06,793 --> 00:26:08,428
One less thing I'm dependent on.

00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:15,968
( <i>soft jazz piano playing</i> )

00:26:30,383 --> 00:26:33,586
( <i>piano music becomes louder)</i>

00:26:44,263 --> 00:26:45,765
( <i>stops playing</i> )

00:26:45,832 --> 00:26:46,766
No, no, no, no.

00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:47,900
Don't stop.

00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:49,168
I don't like playing

00:26:49,235 --> 00:26:51,104
in front of an audience.

00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,538
It's just me.

00:26:53,224 --> 00:26:56,127
What, are you uncomfortable in
front of strangers or something?

00:26:56,194 --> 00:26:58,529
No, I just came by to
ask you a few questions

00:26:58,596 --> 00:27:00,298
and I got a little
carried away.

00:27:00,365 --> 00:27:03,201
Oh.

00:27:03,267 --> 00:27:05,036
Well, if you keep playing

00:27:05,103 --> 00:27:08,172
I'll keep talking.

00:27:17,248 --> 00:27:19,150
( <i>starts playing softly</i> )

00:27:24,689 --> 00:27:27,933
So, um, how well do you know
these people you play with?

00:27:27,933 --> 00:27:28,867
Oh...

00:27:28,934 --> 00:27:31,036
well enough.

00:27:37,265 --> 00:27:38,433
Who is this?

00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,368
I thought I was the one

00:27:40,435 --> 00:27:43,839
asking questions here.

00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:47,943
Warrick Brown.

00:27:50,946 --> 00:27:52,514
Lillie Ivers.

00:27:54,015 --> 00:27:56,751
So, I guess we're not
strangers anymore.

00:28:00,622 --> 00:28:02,791
Maybe you should

00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:05,227
come by later...

00:28:05,293 --> 00:28:07,796
so we can talk some more.

00:28:11,132 --> 00:28:13,602
Well, Jane may play hockey

00:28:13,668 --> 00:28:17,138
but her sheets
are distinctly female.

00:28:17,205 --> 00:28:19,107
There are semen
stains everywhere.

00:28:19,174 --> 00:28:20,675
Not very Victoria Secret.

00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:24,012
What is Victoria's Secret,
I wonder?

00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:26,181
Beauty, Grissom.

00:28:26,248 --> 00:28:27,682
Remember?

00:28:43,832 --> 00:28:46,701
Sheets may be female,
but this toenail

00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:47,769
belonged to a man.

00:28:47,836 --> 00:28:49,738
With all the sex these
people are having

00:28:49,804 --> 00:28:51,306
maybe I should
take up hockey.

00:28:57,112 --> 00:28:59,581
I told you what I make.

00:28:59,648 --> 00:29:00,474
What do you bring in?

00:29:01,182 --> 00:29:02,684
50, 60 a year?

00:29:02,751 --> 00:29:04,252
So, that's what
you're all about?

00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:06,321
No, that's what
the business is all about.

00:29:06,388 --> 00:29:07,689
Then run.

00:29:07,756 --> 00:29:10,058
Hmm.

00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,427
I just thought that
with your kind of talent

00:29:12,494 --> 00:29:14,028
you know,
I could dial you in.

00:29:14,095 --> 00:29:16,631
I've got a manager

00:29:16,698 --> 00:29:19,467
with a pipeline to God.

00:29:19,534 --> 00:29:21,703
Sounds like you're
pretty dependent on him.

00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:26,808
I've been booked solid
for the past two years.

00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:31,212
Next stop...
Blue Note, Motown...

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,547
anything I want.

00:29:32,614 --> 00:29:35,683
Studio time,
recording contracts...

00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,818
Great.

00:29:36,885 --> 00:29:39,821
I'm a musician, Warrick,
and I recognize talent.

00:29:41,516 --> 00:29:43,551
And the way you look...

00:29:43,618 --> 00:29:47,488
you might as well
be dipped in gold.

00:29:47,555 --> 00:29:48,766
I don't know
about all that.

00:29:48,766 --> 00:29:50,934
What are you holding back for?

00:29:52,703 --> 00:29:55,105
You could be out there
making a difference.

00:29:55,172 --> 00:29:57,908
I already do make a difference.

00:29:57,975 --> 00:29:59,443
Yeah, riding around
chasing ghosts

00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,711
with that partner of yours.

00:30:00,778 --> 00:30:02,045
Nobody even knows you exist.

00:30:02,112 --> 00:30:04,615
You do.

00:30:06,483 --> 00:30:08,085
Show time.

00:30:08,152 --> 00:30:09,453
We're back.

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,988
Okay.

00:30:13,023 --> 00:30:14,625
Okay, so...

00:30:14,691 --> 00:30:15,993
Knock 'em dead.

00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:17,761
I'll try.

00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:47,958
Catherine...

00:30:48,025 --> 00:30:50,327
you seen any guys
with a broken tooth lately?

00:30:50,394 --> 00:30:51,562
Yeah, I saw
ten of them.

00:30:51,628 --> 00:30:53,497
Yeah, well, one of them
is your suspect.

00:30:53,564 --> 00:30:55,199
I got your page.
What's the big news?

00:30:55,265 --> 00:30:57,182
Oh, that tooth that you found at
the bottom of the snow pile...

00:30:57,182 --> 00:30:58,217
You got a match.
To what?

00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:00,592
To the nasty-ass toenail
that Sara found.

00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,694
What? I thought it
belonged to the dead guy.

00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:04,162
No, it belongs to a live guy.

00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:05,497
So, what you're
saying is

00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,432
whoever was in
Jane Gallagher's bed

00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:10,068
was on the ice
the night that
Terry Rivers died.

00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:11,169
Goal.

00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,838
It's a temp.

00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:16,108
What about the girl?
Is she a temp, too?

00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:20,011
You know, I treated Jane better
than that mutt Rivers ever did.

00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:22,280
And it never
cost her a cent.

00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,049
Is that why you
hated Terry?

00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:26,284
He was on my
short list, yeah.

00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:27,486
You know, I got a list.

00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,288
It's got a negative figure
of 12,000 after your name.

00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:33,892
Well, money's kind
of like my tooth.

00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,894
It don't grow back.

00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:37,896
Did you ever hear
the story of the 19th century

00:31:37,963 --> 00:31:39,599
Chinese goldsmith?

00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:42,435
He lost a lot of money
for his goldsmith buddies

00:31:42,502 --> 00:31:44,537
due to his shoddy
business practices

00:31:44,604 --> 00:31:46,205
so they decided to kill him

00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:49,742
by biting him to death.

00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:51,778
123 goldsmiths took a bite
out of the victim

00:31:51,844 --> 00:31:54,714
insuring that no one individual
could be blamed for the murder.

00:31:54,781 --> 00:31:55,748
For who would know

00:31:55,815 --> 00:31:57,951
which one administered
the lethal bite.

00:31:58,017 --> 00:32:00,219
SIDLE:
You're the captain
of the rat pack.

00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:01,788
You make it so everyone
gets a shot in

00:32:01,854 --> 00:32:04,057
and no one takes the blame--
it's a win-win situation.

00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:07,293
Well, it's a nice little
bedtime story for your kids

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,529
but it doesn't have
a lick of truth.

00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:11,497
Well, there's
truth in this:

00:32:11,564 --> 00:32:13,566
your friend Jane
is pregnant.

00:32:13,633 --> 00:32:17,604
I'm going to be a dad?

00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,305
( <i>pager beeping</i> )

00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:23,076
What kind
of coronary anomaly?

00:32:23,142 --> 00:32:25,044
W.P.W.: Wolff-Parkinson
-White Syndrome.

00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:27,313
Interferes with the heart's
electrical system.

00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,314
I never heard of it.

00:32:28,381 --> 00:32:30,116
Well, it didn't show
during the post

00:32:30,183 --> 00:32:31,784
but I looked at
the tissue sections

00:32:31,851 --> 00:32:33,119
in histopath.

00:32:33,186 --> 00:32:34,754
They showed a small defect

00:32:34,821 --> 00:32:37,323
in the atrium of the heart.

00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,428
So, the game had nothing
to do with it?

00:32:42,495 --> 00:32:43,429
It was the heart?

00:32:43,496 --> 00:32:44,530
Not necessarily.

00:32:44,597 --> 00:32:47,433
You know the quinine
I found in his system?

00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,435
Lethal for someone
with W.P.W.

00:32:49,502 --> 00:32:51,337
Big scars didn't
do him in.

00:32:51,404 --> 00:32:53,306
It was the little scar.

00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:56,109
Someone still gets an assist.

00:33:05,474 --> 00:33:07,410
Hey, Sara.

00:33:07,476 --> 00:33:08,978
If you come up here
on your nights off

00:33:09,045 --> 00:33:10,682
people are going
to start confusing
the two of you.

00:33:10,682 --> 00:33:12,250
You're here.

00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,655
What's up?

00:33:16,721 --> 00:33:18,056
New lead.

00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:19,491
The bartender.

00:33:20,492 --> 00:33:21,593
Purple.

00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,461
Marquis Mecke Froede.

00:33:23,528 --> 00:33:25,330
Test for opiates.

00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:35,206
Purple.

00:33:35,273 --> 00:33:37,042
You know
what that means.

00:33:39,844 --> 00:33:43,481
The coasters test
positive for heroin.

00:33:43,548 --> 00:33:46,885
<i>He sandwiched the drugs</i>
<i>between the coasters.</i>

00:33:46,952 --> 00:33:48,520
<i>That's how he hid it.</i>

00:33:48,587 --> 00:33:51,256
<i>He was dealing</i>
<i>from behind the bar.</i>

00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:52,791
When we found those
two coasters

00:33:52,857 --> 00:33:54,259
in Stan Grevey's
dressing room

00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:56,127
we assumed that
there was two people--

00:33:56,194 --> 00:33:57,462
either a user or supplier.

00:33:57,529 --> 00:33:58,997
There weren't.

00:33:59,064 --> 00:34:01,533
Just our guy--
the victim.

00:34:04,469 --> 00:34:06,238
What's wrong?

00:34:06,304 --> 00:34:10,275
He wasn't the only one
with two coasters, man.

00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,044
What do you mean?

00:34:13,111 --> 00:34:16,147
Remember when we talked
to Lillie about the scarf?

00:34:16,214 --> 00:34:17,449
Yeah?

00:34:17,515 --> 00:34:19,284
STOKES:
<i>She had a drink</i>

00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:20,885
<i>with two coasters.</i>

00:34:20,952 --> 00:34:22,287
So what?

00:34:22,354 --> 00:34:24,489
There could be
a hundred reasons why she...

00:34:24,556 --> 00:34:25,490
Did you
not hear me?

00:34:25,557 --> 00:34:26,524
She might be involved.

00:34:26,591 --> 00:34:27,959
You got to walk away
from this fast.

00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:29,561
We got the dealer--
the bartender.

00:34:29,628 --> 00:34:30,729
Let's just take him out.

00:34:30,795 --> 00:34:31,730
And we will.

00:34:31,796 --> 00:34:33,031
What about her?

00:34:33,098 --> 00:34:34,633
What <i>about</i> her?

00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:36,234
Why don't you...

00:34:36,301 --> 00:34:39,037
Why don't you just
let me handle my business.

00:34:39,104 --> 00:34:40,405
Then handle it.

00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:49,147
We were in the sack.

00:34:49,214 --> 00:34:51,416
Right in
the middle of it.

00:34:51,483 --> 00:34:53,752
Next thing I know,
he stopped...

00:34:53,818 --> 00:34:55,020
How do I say this?

00:34:55,086 --> 00:34:56,288
He stopped...

00:34:56,354 --> 00:34:57,989
Doing it?

00:34:58,056 --> 00:34:58,990
Yes. Thank you.

00:34:59,057 --> 00:35:00,258
His face
was flushed.

00:35:00,325 --> 00:35:01,293
He was sweating.

00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,662
It was all good,
and then he just...

00:35:07,465 --> 00:35:10,068
<i>He went soft and passed out.</i>

00:35:11,836 --> 00:35:13,905
I was scared.
I called the team doctor.

00:35:13,972 --> 00:35:15,006
The paramedics came

00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:16,641
and rushed him
to the E.R.

00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:18,643
You know we got
his medical records.

00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,078
Let me ask you
a question.

00:35:20,145 --> 00:35:21,146
When Terry came to

00:35:21,212 --> 00:35:23,782
did he tell you what
had happened to him?

00:35:23,848 --> 00:35:25,517
He didn't tell
me anything.

00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:27,052
Neither did
the doctors.

00:35:27,118 --> 00:35:28,119
I wasn't family.

00:35:28,186 --> 00:35:29,187
What did you do?

00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:30,455
Took off.

00:35:30,522 --> 00:35:33,124
I didn't want
anybody to know
I'd been with him.

00:35:33,191 --> 00:35:35,760
Worried that the father
of your child

00:35:35,827 --> 00:35:38,163
might find out?

00:35:43,268 --> 00:35:45,637
I was sleeping with Terry

00:35:45,704 --> 00:35:47,606
but I was dating Tommy.

00:35:47,672 --> 00:35:50,375
And what's the difference?

00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:52,143
Terry was a bad boy.

00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:55,013
The kind of guy you just
can't get out of your system.

00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,449
Who's on your mind
all the time.

00:35:57,515 --> 00:35:59,484
He used to drive

00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:02,020
my friends crazy.

00:36:02,087 --> 00:36:06,558
Tommy... husband material.

00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:11,463
So we just double-checked
the search warrant

00:36:11,529 --> 00:36:13,198
returned from Terry
Rivers apartment.

00:36:13,265 --> 00:36:15,233
There was no quinine
found in the location.

00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,102
He never had
a prescription
for quinine.

00:36:17,168 --> 00:36:19,037
Well, according
to Doc Robbins

00:36:19,104 --> 00:36:20,405
he never had
malaria.

00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:22,807
Do you have
his medical file?

00:36:22,874 --> 00:36:23,909
Yeah.

00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:25,243
Let me see it.

00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,178
Right here.

00:36:27,245 --> 00:36:29,214
GRISSOM:
So Jane Gallagher
is officially

00:36:29,281 --> 00:36:30,248
no longer a suspect.

00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:31,650
Didn't have access
to quinine

00:36:31,716 --> 00:36:33,752
let alone know
it would kill him.

00:36:33,818 --> 00:36:34,853
So who did know?

00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,321
Terry was
a roughneck.

00:36:36,388 --> 00:36:37,355
He dished it out

00:36:37,422 --> 00:36:40,091
so the other players
dished it out harder.

00:36:40,158 --> 00:36:41,359
Which they wouldn't
have done

00:36:41,426 --> 00:36:42,861
if they had known
about his heart.

00:36:42,928 --> 00:36:44,529
They would have
played tentatively.

00:36:44,596 --> 00:36:47,399
Which in hockey
is a sacrilege.

00:36:47,465 --> 00:36:49,267
Someone besides Terry
had to know.

00:36:50,368 --> 00:36:51,670
Somebody did.

00:36:51,736 --> 00:36:53,905
You can withhold
medical information

00:36:53,972 --> 00:36:55,407
from your friends all you want

00:36:55,473 --> 00:36:56,608
but it's still going

00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:58,310
to be in your
hospital record.

00:36:58,376 --> 00:36:59,411
Anyone with access

00:36:59,477 --> 00:37:02,147
to Terry's medical records
knew how to kill him.

00:37:03,982 --> 00:37:06,751
How many patients do you have
with malaria?

00:37:06,818 --> 00:37:08,920
I'm an orthopedist. None.

00:37:08,987 --> 00:37:10,422
BRASS:
Not according
to the pharmacy

00:37:10,488 --> 00:37:11,556
in your medical building.

00:37:11,623 --> 00:37:13,792
Last month you wrote
a prescription for quinine--

00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:16,561
an anti-malaria
medication.

00:37:16,628 --> 00:37:17,963
Malaria in Las Vegas.

00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:20,131
No wonder they
were out of stock.

00:37:20,198 --> 00:37:21,900
Look, a friend of mine
was going to Africa.

00:37:21,967 --> 00:37:23,802
I did him a favor.
That's it.

00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:25,804
Now, is there a crime in that?

00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:29,507
Well... a man is dead.

00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:37,018
It hurts getting stitched.

00:37:37,084 --> 00:37:38,099
It hurts even more

00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:39,333
when you get home.

00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,869
I always give the guys
something for the pain.

00:37:41,936 --> 00:37:43,140
So you're
the go-to guy?

00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,076
I am the on-site doctor
for this facility.

00:37:46,143 --> 00:37:48,312
Nothing more and nothing less.

00:37:48,378 --> 00:37:50,180
GRISSOM:
Is this Umbria or Tuscany?

00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:53,317
SIDLE:
Italy.

00:37:53,383 --> 00:37:54,651
That's pretty serious.

00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,457
But Jane's had a couple
of boyfriends

00:38:00,524 --> 00:38:02,192
since that trip,
right?

00:38:14,404 --> 00:38:17,641
Terry was an injury
waiting to happen, wasn't he?

00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:19,977
And when it did

00:38:20,043 --> 00:38:21,178
you were there on the bench

00:38:21,245 --> 00:38:22,813
with two little pills
in your hand.

00:38:32,723 --> 00:38:34,491
So what?

00:38:34,558 --> 00:38:36,026
So what if I gave him quinine?

00:38:36,093 --> 00:38:38,328
It's like giving
a candy bar to
a diabetic

00:38:38,395 --> 00:38:39,897
if you know
he's a diabetic.

00:38:39,963 --> 00:38:41,565
SIDLE:
And you knew, Doctor.

00:38:41,632 --> 00:38:44,201
Terry Rivers had
a heart condition.

00:38:48,372 --> 00:38:49,473
I need you.

00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,108
Oh, yeah, since when?

00:38:51,175 --> 00:38:53,077
Look, we tried it out,
it didn't work.

00:38:53,143 --> 00:38:54,078
We're friends.

00:38:54,144 --> 00:38:56,046
I don't want the whole
world to know

00:38:56,113 --> 00:38:57,514
that I've been
with Terry.

00:38:59,383 --> 00:39:00,584
Please?

00:39:02,453 --> 00:39:05,689
Okay, okay.
I'll stay with Terry.

00:39:05,756 --> 00:39:08,058
You were always
cleaning up her messes

00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:09,693
weren't you,
Doctor?

00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,696
Jane told us she paid
you a visit a couple
of days ago.

00:39:12,763 --> 00:39:15,232
She thought
she had the flu...
but she didn't.

00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:17,067
She's pregnant.

00:39:17,134 --> 00:39:19,837
And with the father
out of the way

00:39:19,903 --> 00:39:22,673
you knew who she
would turn to.

00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:26,143
But Tommy Sconzo
is the father.

00:39:29,613 --> 00:39:32,015
You killed the wrong guy.

00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:39,289
BRASS:
Let's take
a little drive.

00:39:54,271 --> 00:39:55,472
You're nearsighted?

00:39:55,539 --> 00:39:58,509
I bet this is going
to match the contact lens

00:39:58,575 --> 00:40:00,444
we found at the crime scene.

00:40:02,279 --> 00:40:04,381
Let me ask you
another question.

00:40:04,448 --> 00:40:06,450
Why deal 91% pure
China White?

00:40:06,517 --> 00:40:08,285
Did you have a beef

00:40:08,352 --> 00:40:10,053
with the victim,
or what?

00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,389
I never met the guy.

00:40:12,456 --> 00:40:14,925
You're going to have
to do better than that.

00:40:14,992 --> 00:40:16,760
You intentionally

00:40:16,827 --> 00:40:19,830
sold him stuff
that was too pure.

00:40:19,897 --> 00:40:21,899
We know he's not
the only guy
you dealt it to.

00:40:22,474 --> 00:40:25,611
Look, I didn't mean
to harm anybody, all right?

00:40:25,678 --> 00:40:27,413
I didn't know
what I was cutting.

00:40:27,479 --> 00:40:28,948
Probably got
a bad batch.

00:40:29,014 --> 00:40:31,317
Bad batch?

00:40:31,383 --> 00:40:35,020
Hey, do yourself
a favor, slick.

00:40:35,087 --> 00:40:37,456
If you don't know enough
about something

00:40:37,523 --> 00:40:38,757
stay out of it.

00:40:38,824 --> 00:40:40,392
It's too late
for that.

00:40:47,399 --> 00:40:49,468
You want to talk about it?

00:40:49,535 --> 00:40:51,370
No.

00:40:51,437 --> 00:40:53,205
Okay.

00:40:53,272 --> 00:40:54,640
I'm going to meet Lillie.

00:40:54,707 --> 00:40:56,375
I'll see you back
at the lab.

00:40:59,224 --> 00:41:00,792
You don't know me.

00:41:06,474 --> 00:41:08,743
Obviously.

00:41:08,809 --> 00:41:11,445
BROWN:
You hiding from me?

00:41:13,414 --> 00:41:15,716
Are you looking
for me?

00:41:15,783 --> 00:41:17,084
Yeah.

00:41:17,151 --> 00:41:19,820
I wanted to talk to you.

00:41:19,887 --> 00:41:22,089
Oh, yeah?

00:41:22,156 --> 00:41:24,692
About what?

00:41:28,062 --> 00:41:29,063
Come on, tell me.

00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:31,499
We're not strangers
anymore, remember?

00:41:33,567 --> 00:41:34,969
Yeah, you're right.

00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:40,007
Warrick Brown.

00:41:44,712 --> 00:41:46,047
What?

00:41:55,423 --> 00:41:58,225
I'm sorry, Lillie.

00:42:00,961 --> 00:42:04,098
Life's too short.

00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:08,793
Good-bye.

00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,342
What are you
doing here?

00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:33,344
I'm playing cards...

00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:38,054
with my friend.
