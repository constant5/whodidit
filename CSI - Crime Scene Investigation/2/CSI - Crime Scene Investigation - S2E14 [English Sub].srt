I need to, uh,
make a withdrawal.

There's sufficient funds

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,542
Just have to clear it
with my manager.

00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:01,214
Is that going to take long?

00:01:02,282 --> 00:01:03,683

It's a lot of money,
Mr. Logan.

It's going to
take some time.

00:01:50,597 --> 00:01:52,199
Mr. Logan, would you like

00:01:52,265 --> 00:01:54,134

Do you want to get that?

00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:04,304
I think you should step
out of the car.

where I can see them.

So how rich is
this guy?

00:03:17,317 --> 00:03:18,885
Well, he had
a million dollars

00:03:18,952 --> 00:03:20,253

00:03:21,655 --> 00:03:23,190
He's a real estate
developer.

On the mayor's committee
to revitalize downtown.

Nope. That's why we're here.

I'm taking my complaint directly
to the district attorney.

You had no grounds to detain
Mr. Logan

let alone disrobe him.

00:05:23,842 --> 00:05:24,877
His hands were covered

and he had a million dollars
in his briefcase.

It's not a crime
to be rich.

Yeah. Hey, can you do me a favor
and drop this off at the lab?

Good. Because if you had been
a cop

she'd already be dead.

00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,291
Who would be dead?

Do you have a weapon?

00:07:03,878 --> 00:07:05,813
Yes.

Then put it on the ground,
along with your pager

How did they make contact?

I, uh, I probably left
a dozen messages for her

and, um, she, uh,
never called me back

00:09:36,728 --> 00:09:39,932

it was the kidnapper.

He said, uh, he wanted
a million dollars in cash

or he would...

I don't normally date
women from work

but there was...
something about you.

your perfume.

00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:28,467
You have one hour.

00:12:31,637 --> 00:12:32,971
What'd he say?

00:12:35,073 --> 00:12:37,075
Let's go.

00:12:52,191 --> 00:12:53,992
Is that a finger?

00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,452
Open the briefcase.
I've got an idea.

00:13:19,274 --> 00:13:20,289
I use this

00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:21,772
to paint my
daughter's face.

00:13:21,772 --> 00:13:24,396
She was playing the moon
tonight in the school play.

00:13:24,396 --> 00:13:25,230
I missed it.

00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:29,465
Mark the edges of the money.

00:13:35,204 --> 00:13:37,239
Do you got
any kids?

00:13:37,306 --> 00:13:39,608
Yeah, I've got a son.

00:13:39,675 --> 00:13:41,443
He's a soccer freak.

00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:45,547
His life's ambition
is to be Roberto Baggio.

00:13:47,063 --> 00:13:47,616
Hey, there's a cop.

00:13:47,683 --> 00:13:48,938
There's cop.
Slow down. Come on.

00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:50,188
We don't want
to be pulled over.

00:13:50,605 --> 00:13:51,313
If we're seen
with a cop

00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:52,355
Amanda's dead.

00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:02,731
STOKES:
<i>Catherine didn't say anything?</i>

00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:04,066
She barely made eye contact.

00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:05,813
She dropped the finger
on the table and walked out.

00:14:05,813 --> 00:14:06,521
Where is it?

00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:08,924
Locked up at the Coroner's Lab,
waiting for Dr. Robbins.

00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:11,093
Unless you want me to wake
him up in Kansas City.

00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,628
Brother's wedding,
back tomorrow...

00:14:12,694 --> 00:14:13,996
It was the right
index finger?

00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,531
Top half severed
just below the right
intercostal joint.

00:14:16,598 --> 00:14:17,866
Any hemorrhagic tissue?

00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:19,835
Yeah, I couldn't tell.
There was blood, though.

00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,136
How did
Catherine seem?

00:14:21,203 --> 00:14:23,672
Like I told Nick,
she completely
ignored me.

00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:25,240
And her behavior
toward Logan?

00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:26,875
Was she under duress?
Agitated?

00:14:26,942 --> 00:14:28,310
No... no,
looked to me

00:14:28,377 --> 00:14:30,746
like Catherine was
running the show.

00:14:30,812 --> 00:14:33,048
A severed finger,
a million bucks.

00:14:33,115 --> 00:14:36,018
And Catherine's not allowed
to talk to anyone.

00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:36,752
Kidnapping?

00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:39,288
So, who's worth
one mil?

00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:41,957
It's time to speak
to his wife.

00:14:42,024 --> 00:14:43,058
I'll call Brass.

00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,192
It's a bit

00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,594
of a coincidence,
don't you think?

00:14:45,661 --> 00:14:47,262
Catherine just showing
up at the diner.

00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:49,731
It's not like she knew
I was going to be there.

00:14:49,798 --> 00:14:52,668
I knew.

00:15:01,688 --> 00:15:03,063
ROY:
That's it-- Yucca.

00:15:03,063 --> 00:15:06,534
One more mile.

00:15:21,815 --> 00:15:23,117
( <i>tires screeching</i> )

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,089
Are you crazy?

00:15:29,156 --> 00:15:30,891
Sorry, it's been
a while

00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,294
since I've driven
a sports car.

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,361
Thanks.

00:16:00,955 --> 00:16:03,257
( <i>gate creaking</i> )

00:16:09,096 --> 00:16:12,099
( <i>inhaling</i> )

00:16:27,481 --> 00:16:29,650
( <i>high-pitched, altered voice):</i>
The briefcase.

00:16:33,287 --> 00:16:35,089
First we need
to see Amanda.

00:16:35,155 --> 00:16:37,124
Hand over the money

00:16:37,191 --> 00:16:41,629
get back in the car,
and drive to a pay phone.

00:16:41,695 --> 00:16:44,665
The Gas-and-Go
station

00:16:44,732 --> 00:16:48,369
Highway 528,
south of Henderson.

00:16:48,435 --> 00:16:51,906
I will call you.
I will tell you where she is.

00:16:51,972 --> 00:16:56,143
No. We need something more
than just your word.

00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,144
Then she's dead.

00:16:57,211 --> 00:16:58,012
ROY:
No, wait!

00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:12,426
The Gas-and-Go station,
Highway 582, south of Henderson.

00:17:12,493 --> 00:17:14,728
( <i>breathing heavily</i> )

00:17:26,373 --> 00:17:27,608
Mrs. Logan?

00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:29,143
Yes? Uh, one
minute, please.

00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,844
Oh, come on, honey, last time

00:17:30,911 --> 00:17:32,713
you got food all over the place.

00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,049
Your father
spent a fortune

00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:36,217
detailing the car.

00:17:36,283 --> 00:17:38,886
Mrs. Logan, I'm Jim Brass,
Las Vegas PD.

00:17:38,953 --> 00:17:40,788
This is Nick Stokes, Crime Lab.

00:17:40,854 --> 00:17:42,289
Hi.

00:17:42,356 --> 00:17:43,958
BRASS:
Have you heard
from your husband?

00:17:44,024 --> 00:17:45,292
( <i>clears throat</i> ):
No.

00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:47,628
When he didn't come
home last night

00:17:47,695 --> 00:17:49,663
did you find that unusual?

00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,632
Or maybe you're used to it.

00:17:51,699 --> 00:17:56,003
Look, our lawyer has advised me
not to speak to the police.

00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,506
And until I hear from Roy
that's exactly

00:17:59,573 --> 00:18:00,541
what I'm going to do.

00:18:00,608 --> 00:18:02,543
How about if we just
have a look around?

00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,144
I don't think so.

00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:28,813
I don't see a phone.

00:18:29,003 --> 00:18:30,037
( <i>glass breaking</i> )

00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:32,706
Where's
the phone?

00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:48,589
They set us up. She's dead.
I <i>knew</i> it!

00:18:48,656 --> 00:18:50,024
He had a shotgun.

00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,760
If all he wanted was the money,
we'd both be dead.

00:19:07,474 --> 00:19:09,310
Give me the phone.

00:19:09,376 --> 00:19:11,378
No, no, no-- no, no!
He said no phone calls.

00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:12,479
They may be watch...

00:19:12,546 --> 00:19:14,048
We're past that.
Give me the phone!

00:19:14,114 --> 00:19:16,483
Listen, please. What if it was
someone <i>you</i> loved?

00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,118
What if it was your daughter?!

00:19:21,021 --> 00:19:24,225
The blood from the finger
was diluted due to the ice.

00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,593
But I made a positive match.

00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:27,661
To the blood
on Logan's hands.

00:19:27,728 --> 00:19:29,396
So it was kind of
like Getty's ear?

00:19:29,463 --> 00:19:30,438
They cut it off,
sent it to the house?

00:19:30,896 --> 00:19:32,798
Wife was way too cool
to have seen a severed finger.

00:19:32,865 --> 00:19:33,799
I don't think so.

00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:35,938
He's a real estate developer.

00:19:35,938 --> 00:19:37,206
Does he own any other
properties?

00:19:37,273 --> 00:19:38,207
Townhouse off Flamingo.

00:19:38,274 --> 00:19:40,676
Under the company name,
not rented.

00:19:40,743 --> 00:19:41,577
But occupied?

00:19:41,644 --> 00:19:42,578
I'll get a warrant.

00:19:42,645 --> 00:19:44,747
See if anybody's missing
a finger over there.

00:19:44,814 --> 00:19:46,616
Hey.
Hey.

00:19:46,682 --> 00:19:49,563
State Troopers just spotted
Logan's car on the 582.

00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,230
Drove past him earlier
this morning.

00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,896
Five minutes later,
drove past him again

00:19:52,896 --> 00:19:53,480
other direction.

00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,258
Grab Sara. We're gone.

00:20:18,748 --> 00:20:20,817
( <i>camera clicking</i> )

00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:24,620
Thank you, Catherine.

00:20:52,215 --> 00:20:53,416
She was burning

00:20:53,483 --> 00:20:54,917
some <i>serious</i> rubber.

00:20:54,984 --> 00:20:57,053
Definitely high-end tires--

00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,647
there's colored flecks
on the treads

00:20:58,647 --> 00:21:00,423
and they're fresh.
It's got be Lexus.

00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:04,994
Does this mean anything to you?

00:21:06,028 --> 00:21:08,030
Looks like some kind
of glow paint stick.

00:21:08,097 --> 00:21:10,133
BROWN:
I think Catherine

00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:12,301
dragged her heels
a little bit here.

00:21:12,368 --> 00:21:14,203
SIDLE:
Yeah.

00:21:16,506 --> 00:21:18,207
Helium canister.

00:21:18,274 --> 00:21:20,877
You mean like helium
for balloons?

00:21:20,943 --> 00:21:24,347
You can also use it to change
the pitch in your voice.

00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:26,549
The Lexus stopped there.

00:21:26,616 --> 00:21:29,152
Catherine walked up to here.

00:21:29,218 --> 00:21:31,254
So the second set
of fresh tire treads

00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,321
on the access road

00:21:32,388 --> 00:21:34,490
could be the kidnapper's.

00:21:34,557 --> 00:21:37,560
Looks like the drop-off
went down.

00:21:37,627 --> 00:21:39,896
Then why hasn't Catherine
contacted us yet?

00:21:50,306 --> 00:21:52,708
Criminalistics. Anybody home?

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,163
Okay... talk to me.

00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,031
( <i>loud squawk</i> )

00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:19,435
( <i>squawking</i> )

00:22:32,915 --> 00:22:34,146
( <i>beep</i> )

00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:35,938
ROY:
Amanda, hi, it's me, Roy.

00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:38,617
Where are you?
Call me on the cell.

00:22:45,021 --> 00:22:45,854
( <i>beep</i> )

00:22:45,854 --> 00:22:48,896
Amanda, I thought you'd be home
all day.

00:22:48,896 --> 00:22:52,834
I wanted to swing by.
Call me.

00:22:54,772 --> 00:22:55,707
( <i>beep</i> )

00:22:55,773 --> 00:22:58,042
Amanda, it's Mark. At the gym.

00:22:58,109 --> 00:22:59,944
You missed your session.

00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,379
Call to reschedule.

00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,181
( <i>dial tone</i> )

00:23:04,896 --> 00:23:07,432
( <i>loud squawk</i> )

00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:10,902
( <i>continuous squawking</i> )

00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:12,647
Too bad you can't talk.

00:23:12,647 --> 00:23:14,606
Maybe you could tell me
where she is.

00:23:54,521 --> 00:23:57,357
Well... according
to the map

00:23:57,424 --> 00:23:59,493
she should be somewhere
around here.

00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,894
Amanda!

00:24:02,262 --> 00:24:04,565
Amanda!

00:24:06,633 --> 00:24:09,002
Why don't you give me a hand?

00:24:23,817 --> 00:24:26,053
Oh, God...

00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,632
Oh, God...

00:24:54,104 --> 00:24:56,673
DR. ROBBINS:
<i>The finger was severed</i>
<i>postmortem.</i>

00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,938
No hemorrhagic tissue
at the point of injury.

00:24:59,938 --> 00:25:01,188
And they used
a serrated blade.

00:25:01,188 --> 00:25:03,438
Jagged teeth patterns
on the bone.

00:25:03,438 --> 00:25:05,039
Not much else I can tell you.

00:25:05,106 --> 00:25:06,407
It's just a finger.

00:25:07,021 --> 00:25:10,558
( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:11,792
Grissom.

00:25:12,627 --> 00:25:13,995
Thank God.

00:25:14,061 --> 00:25:15,863
There was a kidnapping.

00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,765
I know-- Amanda Freeman.

00:25:17,832 --> 00:25:20,034
She's dead... and whoever
touched the money

00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,803
probably has glow-in-the-dark
paint on their hands.

00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,006
You got my clues?

00:25:25,072 --> 00:25:26,240
Yeah, nicely done.

00:25:26,307 --> 00:25:29,343
I know just about everything
except...

00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,579
where are you?

00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:36,181
She ate, but she didn't
fall asleep till way late.

00:25:36,248 --> 00:25:38,117
We had her helping Greg
go out in the lab.

00:25:38,183 --> 00:25:40,085
I bet she loved that.
Yeah.

00:25:45,813 --> 00:25:48,349
I owe you.
Thank you.

00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:50,485
Oh...

00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:14,063
GRISSOM:
So, you couldn't see
what he looked like?

00:26:14,063 --> 00:26:16,365
You're assuming
it was a "he."

00:26:16,432 --> 00:26:17,800
Rabbit mask.

00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,235
Full-beam headlights.

00:26:19,302 --> 00:26:20,469
Truman Capote voice.

00:26:20,536 --> 00:26:22,104
Who can tell gender?

00:26:22,171 --> 00:26:23,639
Amanda Freeman.

00:26:26,108 --> 00:26:28,044
My guess is, she's been

00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,780
in the water about 24 hours.

00:26:30,846 --> 00:26:32,048
Washerwoman effect.

00:26:32,114 --> 00:26:34,150
But no saponification.

00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,960
Blowfly eggs?

00:26:44,026 --> 00:26:46,229
Unhatched ova.

00:26:46,295 --> 00:26:47,230
They're waterlogged.

00:26:47,296 --> 00:26:49,165
I found some in her nose
and trachea, too.

00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,467
The decomposing body
would need time

00:26:51,534 --> 00:26:54,136
to attract the bugs
before submersion.

00:26:54,203 --> 00:26:56,072
Well, she's been dead 48 hours

00:26:56,138 --> 00:26:58,541
24 hours above water,
24 hours under.

00:26:58,608 --> 00:27:00,109
Bloody nose, ecchymosis.

00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,578
She took a beating.

00:27:02,645 --> 00:27:03,746
Cause of death?

00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,230
Blunt-force trauma.

00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:06,916
Back of the head.

00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:12,788
Look at this.

00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,260
What is it?

00:27:17,326 --> 00:27:19,595
You'll have to get it
under the microscope.

00:27:19,662 --> 00:27:21,330
My guess is
some form of stone.

00:27:21,397 --> 00:27:22,698
Granite maybe.

00:27:22,765 --> 00:27:24,667
I'm going to head over
to the townhouse

00:27:24,734 --> 00:27:26,702
check out those blood spots
with Nick.

00:27:33,272 --> 00:27:34,773
Mr. Logan?

00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,742
I need to see her.

00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:37,876
Please.

00:27:37,943 --> 00:27:40,712
I wouldn't advise that.

00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:42,681
Look, she...

00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:44,950
was my life.

00:27:45,017 --> 00:27:46,785
I loved her.

00:27:48,454 --> 00:27:49,922
Please?

00:27:56,261 --> 00:27:57,629
Ooh... ooh...

00:27:59,264 --> 00:28:01,300
It's my fault.

00:28:03,268 --> 00:28:04,937
If I'd only...

00:28:05,003 --> 00:28:06,238
gotten to her sooner.

00:28:06,305 --> 00:28:08,207
If I'd only paid them sooner...

00:28:08,273 --> 00:28:09,775
It wouldn't have made
any difference.

00:28:09,842 --> 00:28:12,077
She was killed long before
you could have helped her.

00:28:12,144 --> 00:28:13,312
When?

00:28:14,938 --> 00:28:15,438
Where?

00:28:15,438 --> 00:28:16,949
WILLOWS:
You've got to give
us time.

00:28:17,015 --> 00:28:19,017
Why don't you go home,
get some sleep?

00:28:23,155 --> 00:28:25,491
I-I don't think I can face
my wife right now.

00:28:25,557 --> 00:28:27,759
This town is
full of hotels.

00:28:27,826 --> 00:28:29,094
All right.

00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:31,763
You can find me
at the Tangiers.

00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:49,181
Marble.

00:28:49,248 --> 00:28:51,884
Good to see you again.

00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:54,419
Yeah, somebody hit the table.

00:28:54,486 --> 00:28:57,156
There's obvious signs
of a struggle.

00:28:57,222 --> 00:28:59,691
Kidnapper probably broke in.

00:28:59,758 --> 00:29:02,728
She made a run for it.

00:29:02,795 --> 00:29:04,563
Got hit in the face.

00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,931
Went down.

00:29:05,998 --> 00:29:08,167
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:10,936
Blood pool here.

00:29:11,003 --> 00:29:13,772
Spatter all the way
to the bird.

00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,874
Birds have blood feathers
and flight feathers.

00:29:15,941 --> 00:29:17,176
Flight feathers
don't bleed.

00:29:17,242 --> 00:29:20,145
No capillaries,
just cartilage.

00:29:20,212 --> 00:29:22,247
And you know this from...?

00:29:22,314 --> 00:29:24,817
Discovery Channel.

00:29:27,219 --> 00:29:30,722
So, how did the killer get
the body out of the house?

00:29:32,658 --> 00:29:33,688
There's no blood
trail from here

00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:36,605
to the door,
so my guess is

00:29:36,605 --> 00:29:37,854
he wrapped her
in something.

00:29:37,854 --> 00:29:39,798
Bedsheets?
Checked.

00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:40,999
Bed's still made.

00:29:41,066 --> 00:29:42,468
Linen closet's full.

00:29:42,534 --> 00:29:44,870
Not to mention,
a wet sheet leaks.

00:29:44,937 --> 00:29:48,106
Plastic, maybe.

00:29:48,173 --> 00:29:49,675
If she was murdered here

00:29:49,741 --> 00:29:51,443
her finger was severed here

00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,378
where are the knives?

00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:07,647
Clever.

00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:12,231
Kidnapper washed all the knives.

00:30:12,297 --> 00:30:15,400
Why wash the knives
and leave the wine glasses?

00:30:16,935 --> 00:30:19,872
Get those glasses to Greg.

00:30:40,592 --> 00:30:43,729
Yeah, looks like someone ripped
the liner out.

00:30:43,796 --> 00:30:45,564
He wrapped her in it.

00:30:45,631 --> 00:30:48,066
Must've gotten dumped
when she did.

00:31:06,118 --> 00:31:08,987
Watch your step.

00:31:09,054 --> 00:31:10,889
Thank you.

00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:28,040
Here we are.

00:31:29,808 --> 00:31:31,477
BRASS:
<i>Ran Amanda Freeman's</i>
<i>phone records.</i>

00:31:31,543 --> 00:31:34,413
Creature of habit.

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,114
Mother, gym,
Logan, pizza.

00:31:36,181 --> 00:31:38,584
But the last call made
from that house was
to a cell phone

00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:39,918
we traced to Mrs. Logan.

00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:42,221
Greg got saliva off
the wine glasses.

00:31:42,287 --> 00:31:45,257
Ran the DNA. One was Amanda,
and the other a woman.

00:31:45,324 --> 00:31:47,826
Mrs. Logan, maybe.
They would have had
a lot to talk about.

00:31:47,893 --> 00:31:49,828
Or fight about.

00:31:59,896 --> 00:32:02,866
Looks like a small tear.

00:32:09,647 --> 00:32:12,049
Looks more like a slice.

00:32:12,116 --> 00:32:13,885
Could've happened

00:32:13,951 --> 00:32:15,786
when he cut through her finger.

00:32:25,329 --> 00:32:28,299
Does this look like blood
to you?

00:32:31,869 --> 00:32:34,071
If the body was wrapped
with this side

00:32:34,138 --> 00:32:35,539
that's on the outside.

00:32:52,123 --> 00:32:54,325
It's not blood.

00:32:54,392 --> 00:32:56,294
Yeah.

00:33:03,634 --> 00:33:06,270
This is a grease stain.

00:33:06,337 --> 00:33:08,205
An oily substance.

00:33:11,542 --> 00:33:14,478
( <i>machine humming</i> )

00:33:20,484 --> 00:33:22,353
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:33:23,521 --> 00:33:25,156
SANDERS:
Did you guys clean the table

00:33:25,223 --> 00:33:26,691
before putting the curtain
on it?

00:33:26,757 --> 00:33:28,526
Yeah.

00:33:28,593 --> 00:33:30,294
'Cause I think
your evidence got contaminated.

00:33:30,361 --> 00:33:31,362
With what?

00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:34,465
Oleic acid.
Goes well with jelly.

00:33:34,532 --> 00:33:35,967
Peanut butter.

00:33:37,401 --> 00:33:39,003
Great.

00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,104
Hey, Nick?

00:33:40,171 --> 00:33:41,339
Yeah?

00:33:41,405 --> 00:33:43,441
Have you been eating
peanut butter

00:33:43,507 --> 00:33:44,442
in the layout room?

00:33:44,508 --> 00:33:45,710
No, man, I hate the stuff.

00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:46,711
Well, we found it

00:33:46,777 --> 00:33:48,512
on the back of that
shower curtain.

00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:53,684
STOKES:
<i>Mrs. Logan scolded her son</i>

00:33:53,751 --> 00:33:55,219
for eating in the car.

00:33:55,286 --> 00:33:56,854
Peanut butter and jelly.

00:33:56,921 --> 00:33:58,389
Said her husband just had

00:33:58,456 --> 00:33:59,724
the car detailed.

00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:10,534
I need to take my car
to this detailer.

00:34:10,601 --> 00:34:11,869
Not bad.

00:34:11,936 --> 00:34:14,205
Come on. You know
that treating the surface

00:34:14,272 --> 00:34:17,275
<i>with a carpet cleaner only</i>
<i>pushes the dirt further down?</i>

00:34:23,781 --> 00:34:25,917
Warrick, you got
those box cutters?

00:34:38,796 --> 00:34:40,765
Did I mention how much
I hate peanut butter?

00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:44,402
Mrs. Logan, do you
know Amanda Freeman?

00:34:45,313 --> 00:34:47,188
Because she called you
on your cell phone

00:34:47,188 --> 00:34:49,006
the day she was murdered.

00:34:49,073 --> 00:34:51,242
Could have been
a wrong number.

00:34:51,309 --> 00:34:52,977
Then, uh, what did
you talk about

00:34:53,044 --> 00:34:54,779
for three minutes
and 55 seconds?

00:34:54,845 --> 00:34:57,215
WILLOWS:
We could compel
a DNA sample

00:34:57,281 --> 00:34:59,283
which would confirm that you had

00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:01,586
a glass of wine
with her that night.

00:35:01,652 --> 00:35:02,987
Is it your intention

00:35:03,054 --> 00:35:05,456
to charge my client
with Miss Freeman's kidnapping?

00:35:05,523 --> 00:35:08,125
I think you went to your
husband's townhouse--
a townhouse you

00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:10,528
probably didn't
know he had-- and
a civilized drink

00:35:10,595 --> 00:35:12,296
turned into a violent brawl.

00:35:12,363 --> 00:35:14,498
( <i>yelling</i> )

00:35:19,537 --> 00:35:21,472
You tore down the shower curtain

00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:23,274
wrapped the body in it.

00:35:25,543 --> 00:35:27,712
Cut off her finger,
stuck it in a mint tin

00:35:27,778 --> 00:35:29,313
and left it for your husband.

00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,249
WILLOWS:
You transported the body
to the reservoir

00:35:31,315 --> 00:35:32,750
in the back of your SUV

00:35:32,817 --> 00:35:34,819
where some
of your son's PB and J

00:35:34,886 --> 00:35:36,420
made it onto the
shower curtain.

00:35:36,487 --> 00:35:37,855
Are you finished?

00:35:37,855 --> 00:35:38,522
Diane?

00:35:38,522 --> 00:35:41,230
I had my drink
with Miss Freeman.

00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,698
I listened
to her rantings

00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,533
about how she and Roy

00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,734
were getting married.

00:35:45,801 --> 00:35:46,902
That's enough, Diane.

00:35:46,969 --> 00:35:48,137
And I set her straight.

00:35:48,204 --> 00:35:50,105
Roy was not going
to leave me for her.

00:35:50,172 --> 00:35:52,208
He loved his money
more than both of us.

00:35:52,274 --> 00:35:55,478
I told her I was going
to evict her

00:35:55,544 --> 00:35:57,246
from that tacky
little townhouse

00:35:57,313 --> 00:35:58,481
and then Roy came in.

00:35:58,547 --> 00:36:01,016
You should have seen
the look on his face.

00:36:02,585 --> 00:36:05,488
And I-I left them there
to work it out.

00:36:05,554 --> 00:36:07,156
Okay...

00:36:07,223 --> 00:36:09,225
If you don't have
anything else?
One more thing.

00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:11,393
Mrs. Logan, can you hold
your hands out

00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,362
palms up?

00:36:13,429 --> 00:36:14,630
Jim, can you
hit the lights?

00:36:14,697 --> 00:36:15,831
We don't have time

00:36:15,898 --> 00:36:17,933
for these games.

00:36:21,604 --> 00:36:22,571
Okay, you satisfied?

00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:23,606
Whoa!

00:36:32,014 --> 00:36:33,549
Look, I can explain.

00:36:43,259 --> 00:36:45,227
Look, I put on a mask

00:36:45,294 --> 00:36:46,480
I made some phone calls

00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,522
I took the money

00:36:47,522 --> 00:36:49,291
but I did not
break any laws.

00:36:49,357 --> 00:36:51,193
You killed Amanda Freeman.
Oh, no.

00:36:51,259 --> 00:36:52,327
I didn't kill anybody.

00:36:52,394 --> 00:36:53,662
I didn't even know she was dead.

00:36:53,728 --> 00:36:54,663
I'm a lawyer.

00:36:54,729 --> 00:36:55,664
I work for my client.

00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,098
I did what
he asked me to do.

00:36:57,165 --> 00:36:58,500
Your client?

00:36:58,567 --> 00:36:59,935
Roy Logan.

00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:01,002
What are you saying?

00:37:01,069 --> 00:37:02,204
That Mr. Logan paid you

00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,838
to dress up as a bunny rabbit?

00:37:03,905 --> 00:37:05,674
That was my idea.

00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,842
So, Roy Logan set
this whole thing up?
Yes.

00:37:07,909 --> 00:37:09,878
It started with a phone call.

00:37:09,945 --> 00:37:12,180
I just did what
my client asked.

00:37:12,247 --> 00:37:14,282
I just played a part.

00:37:21,223 --> 00:37:25,393
So, basically, this was a stage
play written by Mr. Logan.

00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,195
That's right. Now you got it.

00:37:27,262 --> 00:37:28,296
GRISSOM:
During this
elaborate farce

00:37:28,363 --> 00:37:29,431
you never thought
to ask him

00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,566
why he was making you
jump through these hoops?

00:37:31,633 --> 00:37:34,002
I don't get paid to ask.
I get paid to do.

00:37:34,069 --> 00:37:35,937
What about the money?
A million dollars cash?

00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,173
Well, Roy was having
marital problems

00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,842
so I figured he was just
hiding his assets.

00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:42,077
Where's the money now?

00:37:42,143 --> 00:37:43,078
In a locker.

00:37:44,145 --> 00:37:45,247
At his country club.

00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:46,715
Where did Logan
say he was staying?

00:37:46,781 --> 00:37:47,716
The Tangiers.

00:37:47,782 --> 00:37:49,251
I'll drive.

00:37:49,317 --> 00:37:50,986
I'll follow the money.

00:37:55,657 --> 00:37:56,791
Mr. Logan?

00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,560
Open the door.

00:37:58,627 --> 00:37:59,728
Please.

00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:33,228
I'll call down, see if
his car's in the parking lot.

00:38:33,295 --> 00:38:35,797
Fat chance.

00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,402
Son of a bitch.

00:38:42,604 --> 00:38:44,706
He had me completely fooled.

00:38:46,308 --> 00:38:48,643
I bet that locker's empty, too.

00:38:54,683 --> 00:38:55,884
Okay, let's run this.

00:38:55,951 --> 00:38:59,187
Amanda was tired of being number
two, so she calls up Mrs. Logan

00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,523
to discuss her affair
with her husband.

00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:06,661
But Mrs. Logan doesn't just
discuss it

00:39:06,728 --> 00:39:08,697
she throws down the gauntlet.

00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,131
He's not going to leave me

00:39:10,198 --> 00:39:11,132
for you.

00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:12,734
( <i>door opening</i> )
He already has.

00:39:14,803 --> 00:39:16,037
Amanda broke the only rule.

00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,239
Don't call the Missus.

00:39:20,008 --> 00:39:22,410
Now he really has a problem.

00:39:22,477 --> 00:39:23,545
Two problems.

00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:26,715
His wife is going to leave him,
take half his money

00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,416
and he was going to jail.

00:39:28,483 --> 00:39:30,685
You got to admit,
his solution was ingenious.

00:39:30,752 --> 00:39:33,622
GRISSOM:
<i>Most killers take their time</i>
<i>planning a murder.</i>

00:39:33,688 --> 00:39:36,224
<i>He took his time</i>
<i>covering it up.</i>

00:39:37,759 --> 00:39:39,761
<i>48 hours to be precise.</i>

00:39:49,404 --> 00:39:52,407
<i>So Logan cleans up</i>
<i>the crime scene</i>

00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:53,408
and calls his lawyer.

00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:55,510
Asks him to help him
with his little charade.

00:39:55,577 --> 00:39:57,646
I mean, what better way
to protect your assets

00:39:57,712 --> 00:40:00,015
than to pay a kidnapper
who's already on retainer?

00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:02,817
Everything from that point on
was calculated.

00:40:02,884 --> 00:40:04,986
<i>Blood on his hands</i>

00:40:05,053 --> 00:40:07,989
<i>he's the last customer</i>
<i>of the day at the bank</i>

00:40:08,056 --> 00:40:09,324
<i>acting suspiciously</i>

00:40:09,391 --> 00:40:11,459
<i>driving recklessly.</i>

00:40:11,526 --> 00:40:13,728
He knew he'd get hauled
in to the cops.

00:40:13,795 --> 00:40:15,263
WILLOWS:
<i>You bet your ass.</i>

00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,466
<i>He didn't leave those</i>
<i>sunglasses behind by accident.</i>

00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:21,169
His cell phone rang on cue.
The call's for me.

00:40:21,236 --> 00:40:26,775
( <i>high-pitched, altered voice</i>
<i>talking on phone</i> )

00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,077
He practically forced that money
into his lawyer's hands.

00:40:29,144 --> 00:40:31,446
Out of one pocket
into the other.

00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:36,585
I especially liked
the little show he did for us

00:40:36,651 --> 00:40:37,686
in the coroner's lab.

00:40:37,752 --> 00:40:39,554
Trying to find out
how much we knew.

00:40:39,621 --> 00:40:41,923
When? Where?

00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:42,991
Why make the map?

00:40:43,058 --> 00:40:44,593
Why lead Catherine
to the body?

00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:48,730
Because without the body, Logan
would always be under suspicion.

00:40:48,797 --> 00:40:51,233
If not by the police,
by his wife.

00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:55,837
So, he left these wine glasses
for you to find.

00:40:55,904 --> 00:40:59,107
Sure, we wanted us
to suspect the wife.

00:40:59,174 --> 00:41:01,309
That's why he
used her SUV

00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,912
<i>to transport the body.</i>

00:41:03,979 --> 00:41:05,247
And he let me mark the money

00:41:05,313 --> 00:41:07,983
because he knew that eventually
his lawyer would touch it.

00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,117
Why though?

00:41:09,184 --> 00:41:10,952
The money was
in a suitcase.

00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:12,888
A million dollars.
Tempting.

00:41:12,954 --> 00:41:15,390
I saw the locker
and I saw Logan's briefcase.

00:41:15,457 --> 00:41:17,459
<i>It was too big to fit inside.</i>

00:41:17,526 --> 00:41:21,229
<i>His lawyer had to remove</i>
<i>the cash by hand.</i>

00:41:21,296 --> 00:41:22,564
How could he possibly know

00:41:22,631 --> 00:41:24,733
that Catherine was
going to mark the money?

00:41:24,799 --> 00:41:25,800
He didn't.

00:41:25,867 --> 00:41:28,303
He probably thought
the bank marked it.

00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:31,907
Besides, there's always
fingerprints.

00:41:31,973 --> 00:41:35,677
So I did everything in my power
to help him.

00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,880
Yeah, and he's probably
long gone by now.

00:41:38,947 --> 00:41:43,552
( <i>cell phone ringing</i> )

00:41:47,689 --> 00:41:49,624
Willows.

00:41:49,691 --> 00:41:51,159
Yeah.

00:41:51,226 --> 00:41:53,094
That's a beautiful car,
that SC-430.

00:41:53,161 --> 00:41:56,598
Don't get to see a nice car like
that in these parts too often.

00:41:56,665 --> 00:41:59,201
So when I see one twice
in two days, I notice.

00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,970
Especially when the driver's
exceeding the speed limit.

00:42:12,714 --> 00:42:14,015
Bravo.

00:42:22,357 --> 00:42:24,759
You know, with all that money
on my lap

00:42:24,826 --> 00:42:26,695
we could've driven to Mexico.

00:42:26,761 --> 00:42:30,031
That's right.
You're short one mistress.

00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:35,570
I got to hand it to you

00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:37,672
that was a brilliant
performance.

00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:39,474
But then again,
any man

00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:42,711
who juggles a wife and mistress
and God knows what else

00:42:42,777 --> 00:42:44,346
has to be a pro.

00:42:44,412 --> 00:42:45,580
I don't know.

00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:49,851
You get so used to lying
you figure, what's one more?

00:42:51,186 --> 00:42:55,123
Try explaining that to your son.
