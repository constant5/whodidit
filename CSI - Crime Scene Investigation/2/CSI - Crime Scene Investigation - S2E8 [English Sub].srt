00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:08,634
You're going down!

00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:11,270
( <i>laughter</i> )

00:00:11,337 --> 00:00:14,307
I got you, I got you!

00:00:14,373 --> 00:00:16,275
I got you!

00:00:16,342 --> 00:00:18,377
I got you.

00:00:27,787 --> 00:00:29,188
Butchy, what's wrong?

00:00:29,255 --> 00:00:31,657
Keep going.

00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:33,159
( <i>screams</i> )

00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,333
( <i>sirens wailing</i> )

00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:52,478
You've been walking in circles
for ten minutes.

00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:54,814
There's no sign of struggle.

00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:56,716
Whatever happened
happened somewhere else.

00:00:56,782 --> 00:00:58,451
This is a secondary scene.

00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:00,186
Body dump?

00:01:00,253 --> 00:01:01,787
Textbook.

00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:02,955
David, when
we dig her up

00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:04,957
I want you to tag her
special processing.

00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,193
Yes, sir.

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,295
Only person who knows
where the crime scene is

00:01:09,362 --> 00:01:11,197
has a mouthful of sand.

00:01:11,264 --> 00:01:14,100
A thousand square miles
of desert in Vegas

00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:17,336
and this perp
dumps the body in a sandbox.

00:01:17,403 --> 00:01:19,672
He didn't put it here
to hide it.

00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:21,750
He put it here to be found.

GRISSOM:
What do you think?

00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:02,440
WILLOWS:
I think we got a van
full of tools we can't use.

00:02:02,506 --> 00:02:04,208
Sand's a nightmare.

00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:07,511
To get to the evidence,
we may destroy the evidence.

00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:09,547
You get these haikus
out of a book

00:02:09,614 --> 00:02:11,315
or do they just
come to you?

00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,252
Every time you find a body

00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:15,853
you have to choose a path

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,222
and when you take
that path, <i>Grasshopper</i>

00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:20,758
you risk destroying
the evidence.

00:02:20,825 --> 00:02:23,761
We grab a trowel and
some fine mesh screens

00:02:23,828 --> 00:02:26,030
and we just pretend like
we're panning for gold...

00:02:26,097 --> 00:02:27,965
<i>Master.</i>

00:03:34,065 --> 00:03:36,734
Gunshot victim
shipped to Desert Palms.

00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:38,669
Santee Cherna, 32.

00:03:38,736 --> 00:03:40,304
Runs this
check-cashing joint.

00:03:40,371 --> 00:03:42,139
Cash business, huh?
You bet.

00:03:42,206 --> 00:03:44,575
Was shot in the leg
making his weekly bank run.

00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,510
Let me guess--
the guy makes his run

00:03:46,577 --> 00:03:47,678
same time every week.

00:03:47,745 --> 00:03:49,313
Night deposit.

00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,582
He's either stupid
or suicidal.

00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:54,685
We can't arrest people
for that, unfortunately.

00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,787
Whole thing
went down here?

00:03:56,854 --> 00:03:59,390
Sister heard a gunshot,
saw a car take off.

00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:01,959
Okay, I'm going to do
a once-around.

00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:04,395
All right,
I'll take the lot.

00:07:07,812 --> 00:07:10,281
You run this car already?

00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:11,282
Oh, yeah.

00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:12,350
The RO's our vic.

00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,417
That's his spot.

00:07:13,484 --> 00:07:14,952
Right here?
Mm-hmm.

00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:16,187
Hey, Warrick!

00:07:16,254 --> 00:07:18,189
Check this out!

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,229
( <i>chuckling</i> )

00:07:25,296 --> 00:07:27,265
We're dealing with
some criminal geniuses.

00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:30,067
Grab the money bag,
slice it and run.

00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:33,304
You forgot the "leave
the evidence on the ground."

00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:36,107
Let's see.

00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:40,978
We got some checks

00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:43,481
no cash...

00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:47,785
and a deposit slip
for $22,500.

00:07:47,852 --> 00:07:50,521
So, our victim
breaks out of the store

00:07:50,588 --> 00:07:52,623
with a bag full of dough...

00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,158
Same time every week.

00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:56,327
Guess somebody
was casing the joint, huh?

00:07:56,394 --> 00:08:00,064
Or... it was an inside job.

00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,934
This morning
everything was fine.

00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,669
Then some <i>pendejo</i>
attacks my brother

00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:06,537
and we're out
God knows how much money

00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:08,639
and now I'm stuck
running this place alone.

00:08:08,706 --> 00:08:10,508
Um, Ms. Delgado,
I know you're upset...

00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:11,609
Upset?

00:08:11,676 --> 00:08:13,911
Upset is for white people, lady.

00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:14,979
I'm pissed off.

00:08:15,046 --> 00:08:16,514
My brother was just shot
in the thigh, okay?

00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:18,082
That's awful
close to serious

00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:19,684
if you know what I'm saying.

00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,820
Ms. Delgado,
how long have you been here?

00:08:22,887 --> 00:08:23,921
Six years.

00:08:23,988 --> 00:08:24,989
You have insurance?

00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:26,924
You better have insurance.

00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:28,159
You take 15% of
a man's paycheck

00:08:28,226 --> 00:08:29,360
just to cash it.

00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:30,428
People use us

00:08:30,494 --> 00:08:32,263
but they don't like us.

00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,130
Thank you.

00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:41,505
So...

00:08:41,572 --> 00:08:43,441
You think the brother
might be behind this?

00:08:43,507 --> 00:08:46,644
Well, I might bet my own
paycheck on that one.

00:08:46,711 --> 00:08:47,745
But if that's true

00:08:47,812 --> 00:08:49,847
then our vic gets to collect
the insurance money

00:08:49,914 --> 00:08:52,116
plus he gets to keep the money
he stole for himself.

00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:54,285
Nice scam.

00:08:54,352 --> 00:08:55,887
Check it out.

00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,121
What's the first
thing you do

00:08:57,188 --> 00:08:59,023
when you see
one of these on
your windshield?

00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,791
Chuck it.
Exactly.

00:09:00,858 --> 00:09:03,794
But the only guy to chuck his
was the victim.

00:09:03,861 --> 00:09:06,631
I found one on the ground
next to his car.

00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:08,633
That means whoever
put these here

00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:11,335
wasn't gone long
when the brother was shot.

00:09:11,402 --> 00:09:12,737
Potential eyewitness.

00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:15,873
She died two to four hours
before she was discovered.

00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,341
Jury's still out

00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:19,343
on cause of death

00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,412
but considering
the whip and ligature marks

00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:23,414
it's no stretch
to say it was violent.

00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:25,483
Some of the scars on her back
are years old.

00:09:25,549 --> 00:09:26,751
Some are fresh.

00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,219
So what are we looking at?

00:09:28,286 --> 00:09:29,921
Rape, multiple
sexual assaults?

00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,856
That's the strange part.

00:09:31,923 --> 00:09:34,258
Her body's
a road map of abuse

00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:36,394
but there's no sign
it was sexual.

00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,329
She hasn't had intercourse
in months.

00:09:38,396 --> 00:09:39,697
I'm thinking trade-in.

00:09:39,764 --> 00:09:42,833
Some lowlife gets tired
of beating on the old model

00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,335
so he punches her ticket

00:09:44,402 --> 00:09:47,104
and starts shopping around
for a version 2.0.

00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:50,875
Here's a woman who's been beaten
on a regular basis

00:09:50,942 --> 00:09:53,444
but look at the care
she's lavished on herself.

00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:57,381
Manicured fingernails,
manicured toenails.

00:09:57,448 --> 00:10:00,985
Perfect teeth, hair.

00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:07,425
Not to mention some serious
breast augmentation.

00:10:07,491 --> 00:10:10,194
That is not a Tijuana boob job.

00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:12,458
Those puppies are top-of-the-line.

00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,665
<i>At least we've got</i>
<i>a pair of saline leads.</i>

00:10:14,732 --> 00:10:15,900
Can you grab me one of those?

00:10:15,967 --> 00:10:17,268
Left or right?

00:10:17,335 --> 00:10:18,636
Dealer's choice.

00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:26,911
What up, Einstein?

00:10:26,978 --> 00:10:28,946
Ooh, you got anything there?

00:10:29,013 --> 00:10:30,248
You think Einstein
had people

00:10:30,314 --> 00:10:32,283
hovering over his shoulders
all the time?

00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,318
If he did, do
you think that

00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:37,021
we'd be walking around
with E=MC squared t-shirts?

00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,060
Would you step back?

00:10:43,127 --> 00:10:44,896
Just give me some
breathing room?

00:10:44,962 --> 00:10:47,498
Maybe I'll tell you something
about the silver sliver

00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:49,567
that Grissom found on
Sandbox Girl's back.

00:10:49,634 --> 00:10:51,168
It's all yours.

00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:06,551
Let's see what the library
has to say.

00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,922
Tempered steel
with aluminum coating.

00:11:10,988 --> 00:11:12,356
Maybe she was chained up.

00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:14,992
If she was, she was wearing
something pretty funky.

00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:16,127
She was in the raw.

00:11:16,193 --> 00:11:17,395
Yeah, in a manner of speaking.

00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:19,630
Remember that sparkly stuff
that Grissom got off her body?

00:11:19,697 --> 00:11:20,798
Yeah.

00:11:20,865 --> 00:11:23,868
I broke it down--
tree sap, ammonia and water.

00:11:23,935 --> 00:11:25,636
Sounds like frat house gravy.

00:11:25,703 --> 00:11:27,371
Liquid latex.

00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:28,539
Never heard of it.

00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:30,341
Really? It's all the craze
right now, man.

00:11:30,408 --> 00:11:31,809
Girls paint it
on guys.

00:11:31,876 --> 00:11:33,511
Guys paint it on girls.

00:11:33,578 --> 00:11:35,279
You can paint it on
yourself if you want

00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:36,347
if that's what you're into.

00:11:36,414 --> 00:11:37,348
You can't get a date.

00:11:37,415 --> 00:11:37,982
I got it.

00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:39,050
Like I would know.

00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,152
Sure, sure. I got it, man.

00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,363
Hey, is that our guy?

00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,998
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:11:55,032 --> 00:11:56,567
Detective Vega, LVPD.

00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:58,002
Can I see some ID?

00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:00,071
I am a legitimate
businessman.

00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:02,139
My card.

00:12:02,206 --> 00:12:04,141
How often do you distribute
around here?

00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,509
On this street?

00:12:05,576 --> 00:12:06,644
Every Thursday and Friday.

00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:07,845
Is that a crime?

00:12:07,912 --> 00:12:09,046
Well, that depends.

00:12:09,113 --> 00:12:11,015
Did you see anything
unusual last night?

00:12:11,082 --> 00:12:13,150
In the parking lot
at Flamingo and Rhodes?

00:12:13,217 --> 00:12:14,952
I don't know what city
you live in, missy

00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:16,787
but in Las Vegas,
unusual is what happens

00:12:16,854 --> 00:12:18,155
when you leave the house.

00:12:18,222 --> 00:12:20,324
We can do this at the station
if that works better for you.

00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:21,893
Okay, okay.

00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:24,395
Um, some jerk told me
if I touched his car

00:12:24,462 --> 00:12:25,496
he'd shove a flyer
down my throat.

00:12:25,563 --> 00:12:26,564
Does that count?

00:12:26,631 --> 00:12:29,100
Maybe. Did you get
a good look at him?

00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,501
Them. There were two.

00:12:30,568 --> 00:12:33,070
A couple of lowlifes
in baseball caps.

00:12:33,137 --> 00:12:34,071
What about the car?

00:12:34,138 --> 00:12:35,339
Did you notice the make?

00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:37,375
Honda, maybe.

00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:41,045
All those tin boxes
look alike.

00:12:41,913 --> 00:12:44,081
WILLOWS:
Dr. Cornfeld?

00:12:44,148 --> 00:12:47,451
Catherine Willows,
Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:52,623
I believe this
is one of yours.

00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,625
Oh, yeah.
414 series.

00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:55,927
Firm, but plenty of give.

00:12:55,993 --> 00:12:57,895
Spare me the sales pitch.

00:12:57,962 --> 00:13:00,898
We removed that from
a homicide victim.

00:13:00,965 --> 00:13:02,400
I've got a photo.

00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:03,434
Judging by the size

00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:05,469
she had a pretty decent
pair to start with.

00:13:07,104 --> 00:13:09,740
Oh, she was
a pretty girl.

00:13:09,807 --> 00:13:11,576
I'm going to need her name.

00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:14,478
Let's see.

00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,814
Oh, yeah, here we go.

00:13:16,881 --> 00:13:19,417
Third-party billing, but
I do recognize the address.

00:13:19,483 --> 00:13:20,952
They send me
a lot of business.

00:13:21,018 --> 00:13:22,253
Mona Taylor.

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,788
She must have worked there.

00:13:23,854 --> 00:13:25,923
Real shame.

00:13:27,325 --> 00:13:28,593
I'll tell you
what's a shame--

00:13:28,659 --> 00:13:31,028
that she was so
pretty and perfect

00:13:31,095 --> 00:13:33,064
and still thought
she needed implants.

00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,432
You shouldn't judge Mona

00:13:34,498 --> 00:13:36,601
for wanting
to improve herself.

00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:38,402
Competition's intense

00:13:38,469 --> 00:13:40,137
especially for a young woman
living in Las Vegas.

00:13:40,204 --> 00:13:41,772
Why don't you put
yourself in her shoes?

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,174
Trust me-- I've
been in her shoes.

00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:44,242
I got out of them.

00:13:44,308 --> 00:13:45,276
Oh, yeah, why is that?

00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:48,312
They were killing me.

00:13:52,883 --> 00:13:54,218
Are you sure
the surgeon said

00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:55,853
this is where
Mona Taylor worked?

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,154
Maybe she was
a domestic.

00:13:57,221 --> 00:13:59,690
No domestic
has a $10,000 rack.

00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:01,692
Not even in Vegas.

00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,594
Well, the DMV
records indicate

00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:06,898
that she hit town
from South Dakota
three years ago.

00:14:06,964 --> 00:14:08,699
I figure the
bright lights faded

00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:10,434
and she snagged
a sugar daddy.

00:14:10,501 --> 00:14:11,502
How much business

00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:13,571
can one sugar daddy
give a plastic surgeon?

00:14:13,638 --> 00:14:14,605
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

00:14:14,672 --> 00:14:15,706
The eternal question

00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:17,942
to which we're about
to find the answer.

00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:23,614
Let me guess--

00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:25,850
three police officers
looking for respite

00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:28,886
from having to control
and dominate our big, bad city?

00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:32,356
Close-- one police officer,
two criminalists.

00:14:32,423 --> 00:14:34,225
May we come in?

00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:42,900
( <i>whip cracking</i>
<i>and man groaning</i> )

00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:45,770
Another happy customer.

00:14:47,204 --> 00:14:48,873
Now, would you prefer
individual sessions

00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,042
or would you like
to enjoy each
other's submission?

00:14:53,911 --> 00:14:55,246
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:14:55,313 --> 00:14:57,081
You don't have to decide now.

00:14:57,148 --> 00:14:59,150
Please, make
yourselves comfortable

00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:01,919
and welcome to
Lady Heather's Dominion.

00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,410
That's her.

00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,947
I'm for fun.
Right.

00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,216
She drove herself
to work.

00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:20,286
But she didn't drive
herself home.

00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,725
Still locked.

00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:35,100
Looks clean.

00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,273
Hey, Catherine....

00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,375
Come check this out.

00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:50,649
What's that?

00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,125
Liquid latex.

00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:54,227
Grissom found some
on the victim.

00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:56,129
Sanders did a trace analysis.

00:15:56,196 --> 00:15:57,998
Stuff peels off
like a glove.

00:15:58,064 --> 00:15:59,266
Handy.

00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:00,267
Yeah.

00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,936
What do you think
that is there?

00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,104
Watch?

00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,238
Bag it.

00:16:05,305 --> 00:16:09,176
We can get a mold and
try and track it down.

00:16:09,242 --> 00:16:12,712
Never lost one of my girls.

00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:15,215
You don't seem very
upset about it.

00:16:15,282 --> 00:16:19,219
What you see and what I feel
are two different things.

00:16:19,286 --> 00:16:20,520
Really?

00:16:20,587 --> 00:16:22,622
Were there any
disturbances last night?

00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:23,857
Did you hear screams?

00:16:23,924 --> 00:16:27,227
( <i>man groaning loudly</i> )

00:16:27,294 --> 00:16:30,997
It's when I don't hear screams
that I start to worry.

00:16:31,064 --> 00:16:34,534
Well, then can you
tell us what time
Mona got off?

00:16:34,601 --> 00:16:36,002
Knowing Mona,
every couple of hours.

00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:37,104
She enjoyed her work.

00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,005
There's no sexual contact

00:16:39,072 --> 00:16:42,442
or anything illegal
going on here, of course.

00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:44,911
Captain Brass, surely you
don't think sexual contact

00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:46,480
is the only means
of fulfillment?

00:16:46,546 --> 00:16:48,982
Lady Heather

00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,350
you don't what to know
what I think.

00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:52,452
Her last client was at 11:00.

00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,821
She would have left at midnight.

00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,124
Do you have any kind
of log book?

00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,992
Some record of who
was working that night?

00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,561
What they did with their
clients, that sort of thing?

00:17:01,628 --> 00:17:03,296
Would that get you excited?

00:17:03,363 --> 00:17:04,564
Not particularly.

00:17:04,631 --> 00:17:07,801
But it might help us catch
the creep who murdered Mona.

00:17:07,868 --> 00:17:09,069
We need names and addresses.

00:17:09,136 --> 00:17:11,171
We also need to know

00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,740
which rooms she worked last
night so we can examine them.

00:17:13,807 --> 00:17:15,709
Mona worked the pool house.

00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:16,943
Give me a minute.

00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,646
I'll have to move
some clients around.

00:17:19,713 --> 00:17:23,150
WILLOWS:
Oh, there you are.

00:17:23,216 --> 00:17:25,385
Um, Mona's car
is in the driveway.

00:17:25,452 --> 00:17:26,420
It looks clean.

00:17:26,486 --> 00:17:27,654
Okay, tow it to CSI

00:17:27,721 --> 00:17:29,756
and then start processing
the rooms in the pool house

00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:30,891
where Mona worked
last night.

00:17:30,957 --> 00:17:33,059
And you will be...?

00:17:33,126 --> 00:17:34,461
I'll be in with
Lady Heather.

00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:49,743
Does all this
fascinate you?

00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,945
Yes.

00:17:52,012 --> 00:17:54,648
I find all deviant behavior
fascinating

00:17:54,714 --> 00:17:57,317
in that to understand
our human nature

00:17:57,384 --> 00:17:59,953
we have to understand
our aberrations.

00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,056
And you think
what goes on here is aberrant?

00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,326
I would say that whip marks
and ligature contusions

00:18:06,393 --> 00:18:08,261
on a young woman
are aberrant.

00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:09,563
Wouldn't you?

00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:12,966
Every job
has its peculiar hazards.

00:18:13,033 --> 00:18:14,835
Rock stars
damage their ear drums.

00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:16,736
Football players
ruin their knees.

00:18:16,803 --> 00:18:18,305
In this business,
it's scars.

00:18:18,371 --> 00:18:19,806
But no one who works for me

00:18:19,873 --> 00:18:21,808
has ever sustained
a serious injury.

00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,110
Mona did.

00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:24,611
She died.

00:18:24,678 --> 00:18:26,880
Not because she worked here.

00:18:26,947 --> 00:18:28,849
That's your assumption.

00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:33,920
What happens here
isn't about violence.

00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,923
It's about challenging
preconceived notions

00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,492
of Victorian normalcy.

00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:40,260
Bringing people's fantasies
to life.

00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,928
Making them real and acceptable.

00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,730
Like the theater.

00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:51,705
It's people who don't
come to places like this

00:18:51,772 --> 00:18:52,906
that I worry about.

00:18:52,973 --> 00:18:54,941
The ones who don't
have an outlet.

00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:58,178
Say... someone
like yourself.

00:18:58,245 --> 00:19:00,380
Oh, I have outlets.

00:19:00,447 --> 00:19:02,949
I read.

00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:06,820
I study bugs.

00:19:06,887 --> 00:19:09,790
I sometimes
even ride roller coasters.

00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:11,625
And your sex life?

00:19:11,691 --> 00:19:14,127
It doesn't involve
going to the theater.

00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:22,602
In my experience, Mr. Grissom,
some men go to the theater...

00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:24,471
some men <i>are</i> the theater.

00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:28,175
Either way, what I offer
is a chance for submission

00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:30,610
or control,
whichever's required.

00:19:30,677 --> 00:19:32,813
Sometimes a client
doesn't know

00:19:32,879 --> 00:19:34,881
what he wants until I show him.

00:19:34,948 --> 00:19:41,054
"No man is a complete mystery
except to himself."

00:19:41,121 --> 00:19:42,856
Marcel Proust.

00:19:42,923 --> 00:19:46,359
I bet
he'd have enjoyed himself here.

00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:47,627
Probably.

00:19:47,694 --> 00:19:50,630
No crime
is a complete mystery, either.

00:19:50,697 --> 00:19:53,800
The whip marks on Mona Taylor
were fresh.

00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:55,202
That can't be.

00:19:55,268 --> 00:19:57,904
Mona was dominant
with her clients.

00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:05,178
I know that sometimes
she saw clients off the books.

00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:08,215
I let her because
she brought in so
much business

00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:10,984
but I just assumed
she knew what she was doing.

00:20:11,051 --> 00:20:15,822
My guess is that one of her
off-the-book clients...

00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:18,959
is a regular.

00:20:19,025 --> 00:20:24,131
I mean, it is a repeat business,
is it not?

00:20:28,135 --> 00:20:30,937
Does that one interest you?

00:20:31,004 --> 00:20:33,707
Yes, it does.

00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,575
May I borrow it?

00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:39,913
( <i>whip cracking</i>
<i>and man groaning</i> )

00:20:45,185 --> 00:20:46,253
All right, Randolph

00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:48,555
you may lick my boots and go.

00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,524
RANDOLPH:
Is it because
I'm naughty?

00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,124
Shut up!

00:20:51,191 --> 00:20:51,958
( <i>groans</i> )

00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:58,965
WILLOWS:
I feel like I'm trapped in
the Marquis de Sade's brain pan.

00:20:59,032 --> 00:21:00,734
STOKES:
Yeah, I guess Lady Heather

00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,602
hasn't quite cleared
this room yet.

00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:05,772
Waiting for recess.

00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,100
Didn't Grissom say he found
some flecks of silver

00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,468
on the victim's back?

00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:35,335
STOKES:
Yeah.

00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:40,540
I may have found the source.

00:21:40,607 --> 00:21:41,808
Mm-hmm.

00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,992
Hey, hey.

00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:00,827
Liquid latex.

00:22:00,894 --> 00:22:03,764
Like the kind we found
in the Dumpster and on the vic.

00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,265
Hand me a bindle, will you?

00:22:05,332 --> 00:22:07,467
You know
what I just realized?

00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,602
Hmm?

00:22:08,668 --> 00:22:11,671
None of this
weirds me out anymore.

00:22:11,738 --> 00:22:15,509
People are just as twisted
in their own living rooms.

00:22:15,575 --> 00:22:18,178
Props are different
here, that's all.

00:22:18,245 --> 00:22:20,380
Well, not everybody's twisted.

00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:21,581
Everybody, Nick.

00:22:21,648 --> 00:22:23,950
Wake up and smell
the species.

00:22:24,017 --> 00:22:26,953
Catherine, do you really think
that those freaks out there

00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,190
running around with their
little dog collars on
getting spanked

00:22:30,257 --> 00:22:31,658
are the same as you and me?

00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,661
Just because you never did it
doesn't mean you never could.

00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,863
No way;
never going to happen.

00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,365
Well, relax, Nick.

00:22:38,432 --> 00:22:40,967
All I'm saying is you're human.

00:22:41,034 --> 00:22:44,905
Hey, man, my mom
and dad are human, and...

00:22:44,971 --> 00:22:46,907
There's one thing you learn
on this job

00:22:46,973 --> 00:22:49,242
is that human beings
are capable of anything.

00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:53,046
A smudge of dirty tire on
a ratty piece of paper?

00:22:53,113 --> 00:22:55,015
I know, I know, it sucks.

00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:58,218
You couldn't get anything
off of it, huh?

00:22:58,285 --> 00:23:00,720
Just because I'm a newbie,
doesn't mean I'm not good.

00:23:00,787 --> 00:23:02,522
Your tire print
from the strip mall.

00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,057
Wow.

00:23:04,124 --> 00:23:06,059
Common to a lot of compacts
and subcompacts.

00:23:06,126 --> 00:23:08,862
But one manufacturer who uses it
standard off-the-lot: Honda.

00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,498
So, that confirms
what Sara's eyewitness said.

00:23:11,565 --> 00:23:12,599
What else you got?

00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:14,267
I've got incidental marks

00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:16,870
from where the tire
ran over something.

00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,538
Left an impression.

00:23:21,341 --> 00:23:22,275
All you have to do

00:23:22,342 --> 00:23:24,244
is find the tire
attached to the vehicle

00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:25,545
your shooter was driving.

00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:26,913
Thanks.

00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:30,417
Ok now,
look at the bullet from your vic's thigh.

00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,253
Five lands and grooves on it.

00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,122
That would be a Colt.

00:23:35,188 --> 00:23:36,423
.38 caliber.

00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,591
According to Vega

00:23:37,657 --> 00:23:39,392
the vic owns a Colt.

00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,527
And?

00:23:40,594 --> 00:23:43,497
And... since he
mysteriously got
shot in the leg

00:23:43,563 --> 00:23:45,031
instead of a vital organ

00:23:45,098 --> 00:23:47,267
I'm thinking I should
go visit him.

00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:50,470
DR. ROBBINS:
Mona Taylor didn't die
from the beatings

00:23:50,537 --> 00:23:53,540
but cause of death was
equally as slow: asphyxia.

00:23:53,607 --> 00:23:55,275
You look like you expected it.

00:23:55,342 --> 00:23:56,643
I considered it.

00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,779
Well, there's something else.

00:23:58,845 --> 00:24:00,580
She had some odd scaring

00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,549
in the inside
of her nose.

00:24:02,616 --> 00:24:05,986
Some small red circle.

00:24:06,052 --> 00:24:08,588
She worked in a sex club,
it could be caused by anything.

00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,023
Like a straw?

00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,626
Maybe I lack
imagination

00:24:12,692 --> 00:24:14,327
but why would you need a straw
at a sex club?

00:24:14,394 --> 00:24:16,029
Well, it's not a sex club,
actually.

00:24:16,096 --> 00:24:17,063
It's a fetish club.

00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,632
There's a difference?

00:24:18,698 --> 00:24:21,668
Like a straw is not used
for sipping Mint Juleps.

00:24:21,735 --> 00:24:22,936
Cocaine?

00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,272
Air.

00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:30,277
Anything from last
night would be in here.

00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,846
Masks, the usual accouterment.

00:24:32,913 --> 00:24:34,981
We don't technically
have a warrant.

00:24:35,048 --> 00:24:36,049
Not necessary.

00:24:36,116 --> 00:24:37,117
I want to help.

00:24:46,927 --> 00:24:48,028
Go ahead, ask.

00:24:48,095 --> 00:24:50,764
"How can I do this
for a living?"

00:24:50,831 --> 00:24:53,667
Oh, that's not
what I was thinking.

00:24:55,168 --> 00:24:56,970
How much does this place
clear a week?

00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,339
Ten grand.

00:24:59,406 --> 00:25:02,142
I'm not with the IRS.

00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,877
Okay, 20.

00:25:03,944 --> 00:25:07,881
I don't make that
in three months.

00:25:07,948 --> 00:25:10,317
Sex pays a
lot better

00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,485
than death.

00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,853
Plus the outfits are cooler.

00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:14,821
Well, I have this
genius tailor.

00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,424
Worked at the Desert
Inn back in the day.

00:25:17,491 --> 00:25:20,594
I let him come in weekends
and play human ashtray.

00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,529
He designs for
me and my girls.

00:25:22,596 --> 00:25:23,697
It's a fair trade.

00:25:23,764 --> 00:25:25,665
You got a good thing going here.

00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:29,336
And the best part is, these guys
think getting slapped around

00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:31,638
and being humiliated
is <i>their</i> fantasy.

00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:33,206
It's like I always tell
my daughter...

00:25:33,273 --> 00:25:34,307
You got a daughter?

00:25:34,374 --> 00:25:36,343
18 this month;
freshman at Harvard.

00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,744
Really?

00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:40,380
Mine's seven.

00:25:40,447 --> 00:25:42,015
Oh, that's a great age.

00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,049
Yeah.

00:25:43,116 --> 00:25:45,252
When I thought Zoe
was ready to hear it

00:25:45,318 --> 00:25:48,922
I told her, "Honey, there are a
lot of things you can give a man

00:25:48,989 --> 00:25:51,558
"your body, your time,
even your heart.

00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:54,861
"But the one thing you can
never, ever, ever let go of

00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,129
is your power."

00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:04,404
All my mother ever told me
was "cash up front."

00:26:04,471 --> 00:26:05,605
Don't take this the wrong way

00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:07,307
but I think you've got
everything it takes

00:26:07,374 --> 00:26:08,442
to make a great dominatrix.

00:26:08,508 --> 00:26:10,110
I take that as a compliment.

00:26:10,177 --> 00:26:11,378
Well, you should.

00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:14,848
It's just about knowing
yourself, being strong

00:26:14,915 --> 00:26:18,018
and not taking any crap
from powerful jerks

00:26:18,085 --> 00:26:20,921
who are used to giving it
all day long.

00:26:20,987 --> 00:26:23,090
Well, death is still
a man's business

00:26:23,156 --> 00:26:25,926
and I don't have to tell you
about police work.

00:26:25,992 --> 00:26:27,594
So, how do you survive?

00:26:27,661 --> 00:26:32,732
By knowing myself
and working hard...

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,268
and by not taking any crap
from powerful jerks

00:26:35,335 --> 00:26:37,504
who are used to giving it
all day long.

00:26:38,772 --> 00:26:40,874
( <i>bag snaps shut</i> )

00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:44,208
Well, these are
masks and straws

00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:45,879
I took out of the sink
at Lady Heather's.

00:26:45,946 --> 00:26:47,280
None of which have been washed.

00:26:47,347 --> 00:26:49,149
GRISSOM:
Mona was a dominatrix
at the fetish club.

00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,585
But my guess is
that she was a switch

00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,653
for her off-the-books clients.

00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,921
( <i>chuckling</i> )

00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,023
You know what a switch is?

00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,593
Someone who's dominant
as well as submissive.

00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,162
Oh, he's even got
the lingo down.

00:27:02,229 --> 00:27:04,064
( <i>mocks whip cracking</i> )

00:27:04,131 --> 00:27:05,632
If Mona's DNA

00:27:05,699 --> 00:27:07,033
is in one of these masks

00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,903
then she was the submissive
on the night she died.

00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,772
You're so dialed into this case

00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:15,342
I bet you don't need me to tell
you which mask had her DNA.

00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:16,710
Yes, I do, Greg.

00:27:16,777 --> 00:27:20,480
I also need to know
which straw she used.

00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,817
( <i>sniffing</i> )

00:27:23,884 --> 00:27:25,619
WILLOWS:
Oh, nice. Mmm.

00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,754
Yeah, that's the idea, Greg.

00:27:27,821 --> 00:27:29,289
Two straws per mask.

00:27:35,162 --> 00:27:36,797
You can't get any air
through pens.

00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,498
And not much more
through straws.

00:27:38,565 --> 00:27:41,334
And even less if someone's
finger is on the other end.

00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,305
I found the victim's DNA

00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,140
on this mask

00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:47,974
and...

00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,643
these two straws.

00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,512
Red mark: victim; blue mark:...

00:27:52,579 --> 00:27:54,815
Our killer.

00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,716
Now we just need a suspect.

00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:07,042
You got the yin.

00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:10,546
I got the yang.

00:28:10,612 --> 00:28:12,014
Actually,
I've got the yang

00:28:12,081 --> 00:28:13,382
and you've got the yin.

00:28:13,449 --> 00:28:16,151
At least as far
our watch molds go.

00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:18,208
So that's from her wrist.

00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:21,256
No air bubbles.
Good job.

00:28:21,323 --> 00:28:23,359
Thank you.

00:28:23,425 --> 00:28:26,195
Now we'll see
how yours turns out.

00:28:30,899 --> 00:28:33,268
Wow.

00:28:33,335 --> 00:28:36,939
Looks like there's a few
carats around that bezel.

00:28:37,005 --> 00:28:38,440
And the band.

00:28:38,507 --> 00:28:42,044
Major bucks.

00:28:42,111 --> 00:28:43,645
Oh, and, uh,
Computer Graphics

00:28:43,712 --> 00:28:45,647
keyed up this
Mideo System.

00:28:45,714 --> 00:28:47,049
Just hit it.

00:28:49,852 --> 00:28:51,487
Yin and yang.

00:28:51,553 --> 00:28:52,855
Top and bottom.

00:28:52,921 --> 00:28:55,991
It's definitely
not a man's watch.

00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:07,069
You know any fine jewelers?

00:29:07,136 --> 00:29:09,138
You have my pants?

00:29:09,204 --> 00:29:10,973
You know, I wake up,
I look around

00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,541
I can't find my damn pants.

00:29:12,608 --> 00:29:14,243
You can't wear them
out of here.

00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:16,145
So what, you want them
as a souvenir?

00:29:16,211 --> 00:29:17,479
I want my stuff.

00:29:17,546 --> 00:29:19,014
Let's start talking
about your pistol.

00:29:19,081 --> 00:29:20,883
I have one gun.

00:29:20,949 --> 00:29:22,317
It wouldn't happen to be a Colt.

00:29:22,384 --> 00:29:24,586
It's on a shelf
behind the cash register.

00:29:24,653 --> 00:29:25,888
<i>Ay, mi hermano.</i>

00:29:25,954 --> 00:29:27,189
I was so worried about you.

00:29:28,457 --> 00:29:29,758
Me, too, <i>Papi,</i> huh?

00:29:29,825 --> 00:29:30,826
Hey, don't worry.

00:29:30,893 --> 00:29:32,594
Doctor said everything
is going to be okay.

00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,799
Burglary?

00:29:36,865 --> 00:29:38,967
In this neighborhood?

00:29:39,034 --> 00:29:41,503
Well, are you missing
any personal property?

00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,839
Jewelry? Small valuables?

00:29:43,906 --> 00:29:46,341
No.

00:29:46,408 --> 00:29:49,378
My wife didn't mention
anything either.

00:29:49,445 --> 00:29:50,946
Again?

00:29:51,013 --> 00:29:52,448
Look, I'm sorry.

00:29:52,514 --> 00:29:54,016
I have to go change Dylan.

00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,784
Before you do...
in the last year

00:29:55,851 --> 00:29:57,419
did you buy a diamond watch

00:29:57,486 --> 00:30:00,055
at Maarten's Jewelers
at the Forum Shops?

00:30:00,122 --> 00:30:03,692
Yeah, in my spare time between
the grocery store and the park

00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:05,694
and Baby Jamboree.

00:30:05,761 --> 00:30:08,764
No, no, this...
this is my life. Sorry.

00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:10,466
Thanks for you help.

00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:16,405
Why do men always make
everything look so tough?

00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,042
If the dad didn't
buy the watch

00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,243
then the mom did.

00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,878
Brass has the
credit card receipt.

00:30:22,945 --> 00:30:25,647
A $20,000 watch and
he didn't discuss it?

00:30:25,714 --> 00:30:27,916
He's lying.

00:30:27,983 --> 00:30:30,252
I thought my husband
answered all your questions.

00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:31,286
He tried.

00:30:31,353 --> 00:30:32,788
Gustav Stickley.

00:30:32,855 --> 00:30:35,557
Very nice furniture.

00:30:35,624 --> 00:30:37,126
No pictures of
your family though.

00:30:37,192 --> 00:30:38,927
I know what they look like.

00:30:38,994 --> 00:30:40,062
Most people keep pictures

00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,663
of their loved ones
in their office.

00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,699
Well, I would hope that
I'm not like most people.

00:30:43,766 --> 00:30:44,800
Is there a point to this?

00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:47,503
Did you order
a $20,000 custom-made watch

00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:49,772
from a jeweler
at the Forum shops?

00:30:49,838 --> 00:30:51,306
I did. Is there a problem?

00:30:51,373 --> 00:30:53,976
No. We'd just like to see it.

00:30:54,043 --> 00:30:55,444
Do you have a warrant?

00:30:55,511 --> 00:30:56,512
Do we need one?

00:30:56,578 --> 00:30:59,214
The truth is,
I lost it on a business trip.

00:30:59,281 --> 00:31:01,617
I'm waiting to find out
from the hotel if they found it.

00:31:01,683 --> 00:31:03,285
Is that the trip
that you took L.A.

00:31:03,352 --> 00:31:04,653
with your boss Ronald?

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,855
Let me refresh
your memory.

00:31:06,922 --> 00:31:08,691
You shared a suite.

00:31:08,757 --> 00:31:10,426
Very cost-effective.

00:31:10,492 --> 00:31:12,628
What'd you save there,
$200, $300?

00:31:14,997 --> 00:31:16,365
I'm a corporate litigator.

00:31:16,432 --> 00:31:18,867
It's going to take a lot more
than that to rattle my cage.

00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,805
Okay.

00:31:22,871 --> 00:31:24,707
How about this?

00:31:24,773 --> 00:31:28,444
Are you familiar with the gal
who calls herself Lady Heather?

00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,713
No.

00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:33,449
One of the girls who works
for Lady Heather was found dead

00:31:33,515 --> 00:31:35,517
with an imprint of your watch
on her wrist.

00:31:36,952 --> 00:31:38,987
That's why we'd like
a sample of your DNA.

00:31:39,054 --> 00:31:40,823
That's a big leap.

00:31:40,889 --> 00:31:43,759
Lost watch to a DNA request.

00:31:43,826 --> 00:31:45,361
I think we're done here.

00:31:48,097 --> 00:31:49,531
What do you know
about the money bag?

00:31:49,598 --> 00:31:51,367
Clean cut, quick way in.

00:31:51,433 --> 00:31:53,102
Can you tell us anything
about the tool

00:31:53,168 --> 00:31:54,236
that may have been used?

00:31:54,303 --> 00:31:55,671
BFK.

00:31:55,738 --> 00:31:56,905
Big knife. Great.

00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,908
Tell us something we don't know.

00:31:59,975 --> 00:32:02,077
I found materials on the cut.

00:32:02,144 --> 00:32:03,278
Nice.

00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:10,352
Got to be transferred
from the knife.

00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:12,621
Red fibers.

00:32:12,688 --> 00:32:14,123
All uniform length.

00:32:14,189 --> 00:32:17,526
The refractive index
of the fibers is 1.544.

00:32:17,593 --> 00:32:19,661
It's a synthetic. Fiberglass.

00:32:19,728 --> 00:32:21,230
Like the insulation in my attic.

00:32:21,296 --> 00:32:22,264
Close.

00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:24,433
But those amber beads
are a catalyst--

00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,835
resin-- which causes
the fiberglass to harden

00:32:26,902 --> 00:32:28,170
once it's poured into a mold.

00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,705
A mold?

00:32:29,772 --> 00:32:31,073
To make what?

00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,943
( <i>whirring</i> )

00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:39,210
There's three fiberglass
manufacturers in Vegas.

00:32:39,234 --> 00:32:40,711
This is the largest one

00:32:40,778 --> 00:32:41,979
for prefab baths
and showers.

00:32:42,046 --> 00:32:43,347
24 employees.

00:32:43,414 --> 00:32:46,517
Everybody in the bath business
uses isophthalic resin because

00:32:46,584 --> 00:32:48,786
it's got the highest
water resistance.

00:32:48,853 --> 00:32:50,421
Downside is, the stuff
gets everywhere.

00:32:50,488 --> 00:32:51,689
Hair, clothes, skin...

00:32:55,092 --> 00:32:57,428
Small world, huh?

00:32:58,763 --> 00:33:00,031
Hey, that's ironic, Hector.

00:33:00,097 --> 00:33:02,233
We're investigating
your brother-in-law's shooting

00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,402
and look where we end up.

00:33:04,468 --> 00:33:07,171
We found traces
of fiberglass and resin

00:33:07,238 --> 00:33:08,673
in Santee's money bag.

00:33:08,739 --> 00:33:11,242
So?

00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:13,744
So, how many knives in Vegas
come into contact

00:33:13,811 --> 00:33:15,446
with both
those materials?

00:33:17,515 --> 00:33:19,183
<i>Dame la navaja.</i>

00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:27,024
Thanks.

00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,661
Hey, could be anybody's knife.

00:33:30,728 --> 00:33:32,196
We also have a tire print.

00:33:34,265 --> 00:33:37,034
See? You got
the wrong car.

00:33:37,101 --> 00:33:39,103
We never said what model
we were looking for.

00:33:40,137 --> 00:33:41,706
We're looking
for a Honda, Hector.

00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:42,707
Do you have one?

00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:44,041
Because we can
check your house.

00:33:44,108 --> 00:33:45,376
We can check
your neighborhood.

00:33:45,443 --> 00:33:47,979
Why don't we just start
right here in this parking lot?

00:34:02,593 --> 00:34:04,695
You know it don't look
good when you run, man.

00:34:04,762 --> 00:34:06,697
You want to tell us who
that Honda belongs to?

00:34:06,764 --> 00:34:08,032
I don't know.

00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:09,500
Okay, okay!
It's a friend of mine.

00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:10,901
He told me nobody
would get hurt.

00:34:10,968 --> 00:34:12,436
I guess that makes
everything okay.

00:34:16,273 --> 00:34:17,408
You again?

00:34:17,475 --> 00:34:19,710
I thought you people would've
gotten the message.

00:34:19,777 --> 00:34:20,878
Oh, we did.

00:34:20,945 --> 00:34:23,281
We also got a warrant.

00:34:26,884 --> 00:34:28,886
Is this some kind of joke?

00:34:28,953 --> 00:34:30,254
This is limited
to my watch box.

00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:32,156
Sometimes that's
all it takes.

00:34:32,223 --> 00:34:33,824
( <i>baby crying</i> )

00:34:33,891 --> 00:34:35,493
Eilene, honey,
everything okay?

00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:37,361
Cameron, go see
what Dylan needs.

00:34:40,064 --> 00:34:43,434
I think my watch box is
in my glove compartment.

00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:45,303
Is the watch in the box?

00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:00,208
Latex.

00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:02,153
Like Hansel
and Gretel

00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:04,488
we just followed the bread
crumbs all the way home.

00:35:14,542 --> 00:35:15,910
Afternoon tea.

00:35:15,977 --> 00:35:17,979
How nice.

00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,716
I like a bit of civility
before dark...

00:35:21,782 --> 00:35:24,051
when all the needy
little boys show up.

00:35:24,118 --> 00:35:26,888
Well, I'm a little
needy myself today.

00:35:26,954 --> 00:35:30,725
My lab pulled skin cells
from Mona Taylor's straws.

00:35:30,791 --> 00:35:32,460
A DNA sample?

00:35:34,562 --> 00:35:36,964
I have several clients
in law enforcement.

00:35:37,031 --> 00:35:38,266
X-X OR X-Y?

00:35:38,332 --> 00:35:40,535
They're male.

00:35:43,571 --> 00:35:47,041
Have you ever seen
either of these two people?

00:35:47,108 --> 00:35:49,625
Not the wife
but I have seen the husband.

00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:52,476
I didn't say
they were married.

00:35:52,543 --> 00:35:53,778
It's obvious.

00:35:53,844 --> 00:35:56,647
Look at the way he's
clenching her hand
with both of his

00:35:56,714 --> 00:35:57,815
and leaning
toward her.

00:35:57,882 --> 00:35:59,417
And see how she's
twisting away

00:35:59,483 --> 00:36:01,786
presenting herself
to the wealthy alpha male?

00:36:01,853 --> 00:36:04,055
She's insensitive;
he's insecure.

00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:06,924
That's a setup for matrimony,
not passion.

00:36:06,991 --> 00:36:09,393
She wants the dominant
male to choose her

00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,362
so she can stop
being dominant.

00:36:14,098 --> 00:36:15,399
You're very good.

00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:16,801
You could work for me.

00:36:16,868 --> 00:36:19,804
You want to be my boss?

00:36:21,505 --> 00:36:22,840
You never know.

00:36:22,907 --> 00:36:25,109
We both might learn something.

00:36:25,176 --> 00:36:27,612
Oh, I'm sure of that.

00:36:30,915 --> 00:36:33,818
I can read anyone who walks
through this door

00:36:33,885 --> 00:36:34,852
and know their desires.

00:36:34,919 --> 00:36:36,187
Sometimes even
before they do.

00:36:36,254 --> 00:36:40,658
Why do you think I selected
china and table linens?

00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:43,494
You like fine things.

00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:45,997
Or maybe I knew
you'd like them.

00:36:46,063 --> 00:36:47,765
Same way I know
you enjoy

00:36:47,832 --> 00:36:51,469
most of the superficial
trappings of civilization.

00:36:52,703 --> 00:36:54,972
I'm that obvious, huh?

00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:56,774
Only because you try
not to be.

00:36:56,841 --> 00:36:59,277
You spend your life
uncovering what goes on

00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:02,613
beneath the surface of civility
and acceptable behavior.

00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,282
So it's a release
for you

00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:06,817
to indulge in something
like high tea

00:37:06,884 --> 00:37:09,253
when it seems,
if only for a moment

00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,422
the world really
is civilized.

00:37:15,259 --> 00:37:18,996
The most telling thing about
anyone is what scares them.

00:37:19,063 --> 00:37:23,901
And I know what you fear more
than anything, Mr. Grissom.

00:37:25,736 --> 00:37:27,004
Which is?

00:37:27,071 --> 00:37:28,673
Being known.

00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:30,841
You can't accept
that I might know

00:37:30,908 --> 00:37:33,878
what you really desire,
because that would mean

00:37:33,945 --> 00:37:36,013
that I know you.

00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,582
Something, for whatever reason

00:37:37,648 --> 00:37:40,585
you spend your entire life
making sure no one else does.

00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:47,558
Lady Heather,
you're an anthropologist.

00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:50,027
More tea?

00:37:54,098 --> 00:37:55,766
But, see, I could
give the money back.

00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:57,301
But my wife doesn't
even know it.

00:37:57,368 --> 00:37:59,470
If I, like, give the money back
to her brother

00:37:59,537 --> 00:38:00,571
I could go home, right?

00:38:00,638 --> 00:38:01,572
Right?!

00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:03,841
Tell us how
it happened--

00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:06,978
then we'll talk
about the future.

00:38:08,613 --> 00:38:10,948
When I picked Carla up
from work on Wednesday

00:38:11,015 --> 00:38:12,950
I doubled back and
I lifted the piece

00:38:13,017 --> 00:38:14,785
that Santee keeps
by the register.

00:38:14,852 --> 00:38:16,454
I figured I'd
return it Friday.

00:38:16,521 --> 00:38:17,522
Nobody would know.

00:38:17,588 --> 00:38:19,423
Pretty smart, Hector.

00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:22,059
I couldn't use my car
'cause Santee knew my car

00:38:22,126 --> 00:38:23,461
so I hit up on a buddy.

00:38:26,631 --> 00:38:27,732
<i>Maricon!</i>

00:38:27,798 --> 00:38:29,367
No... Ow!

00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:30,434
( <i>blow landing</i> )

00:38:32,303 --> 00:38:34,338
( <i>car revving</i>
<i>and tires squealing</i> )

00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:40,344
Look, it's not like
they're out of anything.

00:38:40,411 --> 00:38:41,579
They're insured.

00:38:41,646 --> 00:38:42,947
For the money

00:38:43,014 --> 00:38:44,582
and his health.

00:38:44,649 --> 00:38:46,017
Nobody loses.

00:38:47,385 --> 00:38:49,387
So can I go now?

00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:51,088
CARLA:
<i>Hector's my husband</i>

00:38:51,155 --> 00:38:53,457
but I hope you keep him
in jail a long time.

00:38:53,524 --> 00:38:55,092
He's not going
anywhere, right?

00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:57,161
You commit a crime,
you pay the price.

00:38:57,228 --> 00:38:58,296
You got that right.

00:38:58,362 --> 00:38:59,297
Oh, by the way

00:38:59,363 --> 00:39:01,132
we found the $5,000
you skimmed

00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:03,467
from this business
in your jeans pocket.

00:39:03,534 --> 00:39:05,803
What?

00:39:12,977 --> 00:39:15,246
You self-righteous bastard.

00:39:15,313 --> 00:39:17,415
You stand there
and bad-mouth my husband

00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:20,585
while you're robbing me
behind my back?

00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:22,320
I was just borrowing it,
I swear.

00:39:23,788 --> 00:39:25,890
You going to
arrest his ass?

00:39:25,957 --> 00:39:27,158
Yeah.

00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:43,041
CAMERON:
They had a warrant.

00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:44,242
I didn't want
to bother you at work.

00:39:45,376 --> 00:39:47,812
This qualifies a harassment suit.

00:39:47,879 --> 00:39:49,480
Too late.

00:39:50,615 --> 00:39:52,450
"Grains of golden sand."

00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:53,117
What?

00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:54,151
Edgar Allan Poe.

00:39:54,218 --> 00:39:56,888
Another man who was
familiar with murder.

00:39:58,122 --> 00:40:00,658
Played in any sandboxes
lately, Mr. Nelson?

00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,227
As my husband's attorney

00:40:03,294 --> 00:40:05,663
I'm advising him
not to speak with you.

00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,899
Eilene...

00:40:07,965 --> 00:40:08,933
Shut up, Cameron.

00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,067
I'll handle this.

00:40:11,969 --> 00:40:13,671
No.

00:40:13,738 --> 00:40:16,941
No, I will not shut up.

00:40:18,242 --> 00:40:19,744
I didn't ask you
to be my attorney.

00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,979
You're just doing this
to look out for yourself.

00:40:22,046 --> 00:40:23,314
I'm looking out
for our family.

00:40:23,381 --> 00:40:24,815
I'm the only one
that's qualified.

00:40:24,882 --> 00:40:25,983
Really?

00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,985
And how exactly
is sleeping with Ronald

00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:29,353
looking after your family?

00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,155
EILENE:
Cameron...

00:40:31,222 --> 00:40:33,558
CAMERON:
Cameron what? What?

00:40:33,624 --> 00:40:35,426
You never gave
a damn about me.

00:40:35,493 --> 00:40:36,427
And our child...

00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:39,897
Our child is just some yuppie pet
designed to make you look better at the firm.

00:40:39,964 --> 00:40:41,465
Which happens to be
the only family

00:40:41,532 --> 00:40:42,900
you probably
really care about.

00:40:42,967 --> 00:40:45,583
Mr. Nelson, you're very
emotional right now.

00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:46,537
Why don't you
just take a moment

00:40:46,604 --> 00:40:47,538
collect yourself.

00:40:47,605 --> 00:40:49,006
Let me get you
a glass of water.

00:40:49,073 --> 00:40:51,242
No! No water, no gum,
no anything.

00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:52,910
If you think
you can trick him

00:40:52,977 --> 00:40:55,146
into giving you some DNA,
you're mistaken.

00:41:03,788 --> 00:41:05,656
Liquid latex.

00:41:08,025 --> 00:41:10,695
What is that supposed to mean?

00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:12,697
Your husband made
Mona Taylor wear it

00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:14,966
every time that he paid
to humiliate her.

00:41:15,032 --> 00:41:17,068
Why would he do that?

00:41:17,134 --> 00:41:20,471
Psychologically,
she was a surrogate.

00:41:20,538 --> 00:41:22,874
In fetish club terms,
she was a slave.

00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,442
Cameron

00:41:24,508 --> 00:41:27,745
would put a mask on her face

00:41:27,812 --> 00:41:31,782
and cover her body
in liquid latex.

00:41:31,849 --> 00:41:34,318
( <i>industrial rock music</i>
<i>playing</i> )

00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:45,796
He made her into nothing

00:41:45,863 --> 00:41:48,099
in order to make her into you.

00:41:48,165 --> 00:41:49,467
My watch.

00:41:49,534 --> 00:41:51,102
I guess that made it more real.

00:41:51,168 --> 00:41:54,005
Cameron couldn't
dominate you

00:41:54,071 --> 00:41:56,240
so he dominated Mona.

00:41:56,307 --> 00:41:58,075
Only his last
appointment

00:41:58,142 --> 00:42:00,545
he got carried away.

00:42:00,611 --> 00:42:02,079
Corporate bitch!

00:42:02,146 --> 00:42:03,714
You still think
you're too good

00:42:03,781 --> 00:42:05,116
to touch your
own husband?

00:42:05,182 --> 00:42:06,817
How about I make you
beg for air?

00:42:06,884 --> 00:42:07,852
Huh?

00:42:07,919 --> 00:42:10,755
How about I make you...
beg for it?!

00:42:10,821 --> 00:42:13,891
( <i>muffled scream</i> )

00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:16,527
Are you begging for it? Huh?

00:42:16,594 --> 00:42:18,129
I can't hear you, Eilene.

00:42:18,196 --> 00:42:21,365
( <i>muffled scream</i> )

00:42:29,173 --> 00:42:34,045
I had to pay some girl
to pretend to be my wife.

00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:39,383
If this is all that you have,
I am...

00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:42,520
happy to go to trial.

00:42:42,587 --> 00:42:45,656
Mrs. Nelson, we're going to
match Cameron's epithelials

00:42:45,723 --> 00:42:47,792
to the ones on the end
of the straws.

00:42:47,859 --> 00:42:49,060
Wait, wait, wait.

00:42:49,126 --> 00:42:50,928
Epithelials--
that's like DNA, right?

00:42:50,995 --> 00:42:51,996
That's DNA?

00:42:53,264 --> 00:42:55,533
Okay, I got an idea.

00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,702
Why don't we test
little Dylan's epithelials?

00:42:57,768 --> 00:43:00,304
See if his daddy isn't
really your law partner.

00:43:00,371 --> 00:43:05,543
'Cause, God knows, you haven't
let me touch you in three years.

00:43:07,111 --> 00:43:08,980
I'm out of here.

00:43:09,046 --> 00:43:10,214
Where are you going?

00:43:10,281 --> 00:43:11,515
Away from you.

00:43:12,316 --> 00:43:14,452
Other than that,
I really don't care.

00:43:26,964 --> 00:43:28,666
I just realized
that you and I

00:43:28,733 --> 00:43:30,635
have a very healthy
relationship.

00:43:30,701 --> 00:43:32,303
We do?

00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:33,838
Well, when we
have a problem

00:43:33,905 --> 00:43:35,773
I don't paint
Greg Sanders in latex

00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,441
and stick a straw
up his nose.

00:43:37,508 --> 00:43:39,877
Good. He'd probably
like it.

00:43:39,944 --> 00:43:42,613
Gil... you're
supposed to say

00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,116
something revealing
back to me.

00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:50,542
Okay. I never told anybody
this, Catherine.
