What do you make
of the smears?

00:02:00,985 --> 00:02:03,888
It's definitely
not blood.

00:02:03,955 --> 00:02:06,558
Wrong color, texture.

00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:16,201
It's hair dye.

00:02:17,735 --> 00:02:19,904
Her hair's still wet.

00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:21,739
You think
the assailant

00:02:21,806 --> 00:02:24,008
surprised her
while she was dyeing her hair?

00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:26,110
Who called it in?

00:02:26,177 --> 00:02:27,679
Neighbor lady--

with her window open.

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,815
Heard the dog
yelping, evidently.

00:02:30,882 --> 00:02:32,750
Called the cops.

00:02:32,817 --> 00:02:34,385
There's no sign
of forced entry.

00:02:34,452 --> 00:02:36,721
The bathroom window's
nailed shut.

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,166
So, has anyone
seen this dog?

00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:53,041
Dog bed, dog bowl, dog food;
no dog.

00:02:54,272 --> 00:02:58,076
Triple locks
on all the doors.

Every shade drawn.

State-of-the-art

As far as we know

00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:07,041
her place was perfectly
hermetically sealed

00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,875
until the cops
batter-rammed

00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,309
their way in.

00:03:10,376 --> 00:03:12,612
Prisoner in
her own home?

00:03:12,678 --> 00:03:14,747
So, how did he get in?

00:03:14,814 --> 00:03:18,417

You've been staring at this girl
for ten minutes.

00:04:17,265 --> 00:04:18,833
Do you know her?

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,802
No.

Why don't you

and finish up
in the bathroom.

00:04:25,507 --> 00:04:27,642
Sure.

00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:38,153
Hey, Catherine,
I'll get that.

00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:39,854
No. I got it.

00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:41,890
Tweeze me.

00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,527
Thank you.

00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,867
So, what do you think?

00:04:52,934 --> 00:04:54,208
A little thick
for a human hair.

00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,875
No, I've seen
them this thick.

00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,373
Really?
Yeah.

00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,008
I'll get it to the lab.

00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,046
Oh, and don't forget
what's under the bed.

00:05:05,113 --> 00:05:06,948
Why, what's
under the bed?

00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,718
Something that you would
have caught eventually...

00:05:10,785 --> 00:05:12,520
Crime Stopper.

00:05:16,758 --> 00:05:17,926
No.

00:05:17,992 --> 00:05:19,894
You know, now that
you're a celebrity

00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:22,530
you may want to think
about getting a new shirt.

00:05:22,597 --> 00:05:23,731
Yeah? Well...

00:05:23,798 --> 00:05:24,933
I'm short on options.

00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:27,769
Besides, the dry cleaners
keeps losing my stuff.

00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:38,246
What'd you get?

to grab a couple shovels

And I quote,
"In his off time

00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:16,518
he enjoys creating
and inventing toys."

00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,752
That's fascinating.

What kind of toys
do you make, Nick?

00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:22,557

00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:34,869
I do love a blond.

Sara

00:06:42,677 --> 00:06:44,579
Yes, you are.
( <i>chuckling</i> )

00:06:44,646 --> 00:06:47,415
We know two things for certain.

00:06:47,482 --> 00:06:50,685
Jane Galloway died
from a lack of O2

00:06:50,752 --> 00:06:53,188
and she is
a natural blond.

00:06:53,254 --> 00:06:54,923
What are you looking at me for?

00:06:54,989 --> 00:06:56,324
Sorry.

00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:57,959
So, what--

00:06:58,026 --> 00:06:59,160
suffocation?

00:06:59,227 --> 00:07:01,262
It certainly looks that way.

00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:02,530
Uh, petechial

00:07:02,597 --> 00:07:05,266
hemorrhaging in the eyes,
deoxygenation

00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,136
led to cyanosis,
hence the blue lips...

00:07:10,538 --> 00:07:12,507
blue fingertips

00:07:12,574 --> 00:07:14,642
and blue face.

00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:16,959
GRISSOM:
No ligature marks
on her neck.

00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:19,041
If she had struggled
with her assailant

00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,792
that effort alone could have
limited her oxygen intake

00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:26,154
causing further O2 depletion
of the brain.

00:07:30,592 --> 00:07:33,495
Easy kill.

00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:34,829
Sexual assault?

00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:36,698
No physical findings.

00:07:36,764 --> 00:07:39,200
You'll have
to check the kit.

00:07:39,267 --> 00:07:41,002
So, he murders her, poses her

00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:43,238
yet he doesn't rob her
or rape her.

00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,908
So, what's his agenda?

00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:49,277
How's that platinum blond
coming?

00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,378
Wrong question.

00:07:50,445 --> 00:07:51,479
Come on, Greg

00:07:51,546 --> 00:07:53,248
I'm not getting
anything out of Trace.

00:07:53,314 --> 00:07:55,150
I was hoping you
could help me out here.

00:07:55,216 --> 00:07:59,087
I took a snip, ran a crossed
immuno-electrophoresis.

00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:00,388
Didn't pass.

00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:01,990
Not hair?
Not human?

00:08:02,056 --> 00:08:04,192
What are you reading?

00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,661
This is Pink.

00:08:06,728 --> 00:08:09,097
Pink, this is Warrick.

00:08:09,164 --> 00:08:10,832
Do you <i>know</i> how hot you are?

00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:12,033
Ssss!

00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,234
Bet I know someone
who's hotter

00:08:13,301 --> 00:08:14,536
and I'm not talking
about looks.

00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:15,904
Yeah?
Yeah.

00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,672
How mad is he?

00:08:17,739 --> 00:08:20,208
Watch your back.

00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,715
Heard you were
looking for me?

00:08:27,782 --> 00:08:28,883
Greg. Come here.

00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,885
I want to talk to you
for a sec.

00:08:30,952 --> 00:08:32,821
Come on.

00:08:35,423 --> 00:08:37,025
What's up?

00:08:37,091 --> 00:08:39,427
Stop invading my privacy, man,
I don't like it.

00:08:39,494 --> 00:08:41,563
I'm just trying
to do my job around here.

00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:43,231
I don't need
the extra attention.

00:08:43,298 --> 00:08:44,966
Okay. But, I mean,
you are the one

00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:46,835
who's doing the
"Forensic Spotlight"

00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,303
in the department
newsletter.

00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:49,637
I didn't
do anything, man.

00:08:49,704 --> 00:08:52,640
Someone from the community
wrote a letter of commendation.

00:08:52,707 --> 00:08:54,075
Public Affairs
ran it. Cool?

00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:55,343
Cool.

00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,213
( <i>pats Greg on the back</i> )

( <i>sighing</i> )

00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,484
So, uh, what
are you fuming?

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,719
Plastic bag
from the crime scene.

00:09:04,786 --> 00:09:06,454
I'm trying to get lucky--

00:09:06,521 --> 00:09:08,990
see if I can get
some prints off it.

00:09:10,558 --> 00:09:12,594
Did she die of suffocation?

00:09:28,643 --> 00:09:29,978
( <i>muffled screams</i> )

00:09:31,212 --> 00:09:32,247
<i>Did some digging</i>

00:09:32,313 --> 00:09:33,448
on Jane Galloway.

00:09:33,515 --> 00:09:35,183
Her boyfriend had
a TRO against him.

00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,851
And according
to the phone records

00:09:36,918 --> 00:09:39,354
the guy called Jane 13 times
the day of the murder.

00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,722
And that's 13 times
too many

00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,423
according to
the restraining order.

00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,125
We're going
to check out his house.

00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:45,160
I'll be on my cell.

00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:46,194
Grissom,
you got a second?

00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:47,195
I got a mystery.

00:09:47,262 --> 00:09:49,297
GRISSOM:
No Becke Line.

00:09:49,364 --> 00:09:50,532
Yeah.

00:09:50,598 --> 00:09:52,801
Hair refracts light
under cross polarization

00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:54,269
but glass doesn't.

00:09:54,335 --> 00:09:55,537
Well, it's not a hair.

00:09:55,603 --> 00:09:56,905
It's a synthetic fiber.

00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,442
Glass-- what do you
think, fiberglass?

00:10:00,508 --> 00:10:01,643
Maybe.

00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:03,411
This could be
a lot of things.

00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,146
You'll figure it out.

00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,550
( <i>pounding on door</i> )

00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:14,055
Looks like the boyfriend
skipped out on us.

00:10:14,122 --> 00:10:15,657
( <i>sighing</i> )

00:10:18,593 --> 00:10:21,229
Hey, Brass?

00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,499
Isn't that his car?

00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:28,903
Control,
this is P-9241

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,473
requesting backup
and medical assistance.

00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:32,607
The 1800 block

00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,509
of Newhaven Road.

00:10:34,576 --> 00:10:35,810
Possible 419.

00:10:35,877 --> 00:10:38,246
DISPATCHER:
P-9241, copy.

00:10:46,421 --> 00:10:47,355
( <i>gasping</i> )

00:10:47,422 --> 00:10:49,357
BRASS:
All right,
all right.

00:10:49,424 --> 00:10:51,192
Get out of the car,
get out of the car.

00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:52,794
Sit down
on the ground.

00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,129
Sit down,
sit down.

00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,463
Sit down;
just sit.

00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,132
Sir, are you okay?

00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,466
You all right?

00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,001
You seem injured.

00:11:00,068 --> 00:11:02,170
No, I'm all right.

00:11:02,237 --> 00:11:03,938
Are you Adam Piorio?

00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:05,907
Yes.

00:11:05,974 --> 00:11:07,609
Any idea how you got this blood?

00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,381
I don't remember.

00:11:13,448 --> 00:11:14,625
We're going
to take you to a place

00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:15,750
and help you
remember.

00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,259
Let's start again.

00:11:20,326 --> 00:11:21,360
What happened last night?

00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,534
I'm telling you,
I don't know.

00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:26,070
Adam, we're analyzing the blood
that we found on your shirt

00:11:26,136 --> 00:11:27,504
with the blood
of your girlfriend.

00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:28,939
It's going to tell us everything

00:11:29,006 --> 00:11:29,974
that we want to know.

00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,442
Look, we broke up
a few weeks ago.

00:11:31,508 --> 00:11:32,610
She...

00:11:32,676 --> 00:11:34,378
She started acting weird
for no reason.

00:11:35,813 --> 00:11:38,048
She had a TRO against you.

00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,585
Something must have happened
to spook her.

00:11:41,652 --> 00:11:42,887
She changed overnight.

00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:45,556
She... she wouldn't return any
of my phone calls.

00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:47,525
She started calling in sick
at work.

00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:50,628
Barricading herself
in her own house.

00:11:50,694 --> 00:11:52,496
So, you went to Jane's
house. What next?

00:11:52,563 --> 00:11:54,932
We started arguing.

00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:56,500
Open this door.
What do you mean

00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:58,435
I can't come within
1000 feet of you?

00:11:58,502 --> 00:12:00,371
Open the door.
Stay away from me!

00:12:00,437 --> 00:12:03,274
I was afraid she was going
to call the cops, so I-I left.

00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,875
SIDLE:
Well, that's interesting

00:12:04,942 --> 00:12:07,278
because according to her phone
records, she never did...

00:12:07,344 --> 00:12:08,445
call the cops.

00:12:08,512 --> 00:12:11,048
BRASS:
But you called
her 13 times.

00:12:11,115 --> 00:12:12,283
Once, you're in love.

00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:13,484
Twice, you're obsessed.

00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:16,053
More than three,
you're a stalker.

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,221
We just broke up.

00:12:17,288 --> 00:12:19,557
All right, I was...
I was rolling on E last night.

00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:21,058
Give me a break.

00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,059
Adam?

00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:23,961
That's not all
you were taking last night.

00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:26,230
I was on a lot of stuff
last night. I was a space cadet.

00:12:26,297 --> 00:12:27,598
I'm not a murderer.

00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:30,868
Blood doesn't match our victim.

00:12:30,935 --> 00:12:32,670
The girlfriend
of a Ricco

00:12:32,736 --> 00:12:34,471
Manzo filed the police report

00:12:34,538 --> 00:12:35,606
last night.

00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:37,708
It seems that Adam here
put Ricco in the hospital

00:12:37,775 --> 00:12:38,709
with a broken nose

00:12:38,776 --> 00:12:40,544
from a fight
at Bar 9-1-1.

00:12:40,611 --> 00:12:42,913
BRASS:
Well, that's
a lucky alibi.

00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,615
Roll him out of here.

00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:14,745
You've got mail.

00:13:19,183 --> 00:13:20,851
Horndog?

00:13:20,918 --> 00:13:22,820
That's a blast from the past.

00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,543
What did your prom date say
when you called her?

00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:48,479
She said that she
was cleaning out
the attic one day

00:13:48,546 --> 00:13:49,647
stumbled upon them

00:13:49,713 --> 00:13:52,049
thought she'd
send them to me
for a laugh.

00:13:52,116 --> 00:13:53,184
You think she's a suspect?

00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,451
No. She lives
in Bosnia, man.

00:13:54,518 --> 00:13:55,886
Maine or something.

00:13:55,953 --> 00:13:57,321
She's got three kids.

00:13:57,388 --> 00:14:00,324
What's she going to do,
fly in for murder?

00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,694
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:05,529
Stranger things have happened.

00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:07,431
I don't know.

00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:11,135
Something in
my gut tells me
it isn't right.

00:14:11,202 --> 00:14:14,371
Hey, what if somebody from
work tapped into my e-mail?

00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:15,573
No.

00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:17,775
Yeah. Maybe I forgot
to log off one day.

00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:18,776
No. You're tripping.

00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:20,811
No. I'm serious.

00:14:20,878 --> 00:14:22,346
Somebody <i>had</i> to
have read my e-mail.

00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:23,847
Change your password.

00:14:23,914 --> 00:14:27,117
I already did.

00:14:27,184 --> 00:14:28,586
How does this relate
to the case?

00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:30,120
Well, he was an eyewitness,
sort of.

00:14:30,187 --> 00:14:32,590
I mean, he says he had a vision
of Jane Galloway's murder

00:14:32,656 --> 00:14:33,724
hours before it happened.

00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,892
He's a psychic?

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:35,926
Well, he has details.

00:14:35,993 --> 00:14:37,595
He has details
that weren't on the news

00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:38,662
or the press release.

00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:46,770
Mr. Pearson.

00:14:46,837 --> 00:14:48,839
Sit down.

00:14:48,906 --> 00:14:51,408
Captain Brass
tells me that, uh

00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:54,211
you had some
sort of "vision"

00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:56,313
regarding Jane
Galloway's murder.

00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,815
Yes, I did.

00:14:57,882 --> 00:14:59,149
What kind of vision?

00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:02,052
Screaming face
in a plastic womb.

00:15:04,088 --> 00:15:06,457
Blood shower.

00:15:12,863 --> 00:15:14,865
Anything else?

00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,068
Three hearts beating very fast.

00:15:18,135 --> 00:15:20,070
Two large, one small.

00:15:20,137 --> 00:15:22,673
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,742
( <i>dog barking</i> )

00:15:24,808 --> 00:15:27,144
GRISSOM:
Okay.

00:15:27,211 --> 00:15:29,346
Thank you.

00:15:30,548 --> 00:15:31,749
This is your
eyewitness?

00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:33,884
The dog didn't make it,
did it?

00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:41,759
What about Jane's
work history?

00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:43,594
Secretary
at a brokerage firm.

00:15:43,661 --> 00:15:46,297
About three weeks
from the day of her death

00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:48,098
she took a leave of absence.

00:15:48,165 --> 00:15:49,567
Medical records?

00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:51,001
She saw Dr. Slater.

00:15:51,068 --> 00:15:54,104
Had a prescription
for Valium and Librium.

00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:57,007
Severe anxiety due
to personal reasons.

00:15:57,074 --> 00:15:59,877
One day back from leave,
Jane quits her job.

00:15:59,944 --> 00:16:01,078
No notice.

00:16:01,145 --> 00:16:02,379
Hotel receipts show

00:16:02,446 --> 00:16:05,249
she checked into the Monaco
for two nights.

00:16:05,316 --> 00:16:06,517
A week before that

00:16:06,584 --> 00:16:09,620
she goes on a frightened woman
shopping spree.

00:16:09,687 --> 00:16:11,922
Hardware shop receipts
for locks.

00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:13,224
Locksmiths.

00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,825
Alarm installations.

00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,126
Phone screeners.

00:16:16,193 --> 00:16:18,996
The voice on her
answering machine-- electronic.

00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:20,965
She changes
her telephone number.

00:16:21,031 --> 00:16:23,634
She cancels all
but one of her credit cards.

00:16:23,701 --> 00:16:26,637
It's as if she's trying
to make herself disappear.

00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:27,838
Make no mistake.

00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,107
Jane Galloway was being stalked.

00:16:30,174 --> 00:16:32,509
Emotional terrorism
at its finest.

00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:34,511
And her boyfriend had an alibi?

00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:37,414
Here's the, uh, worst part.

00:16:37,481 --> 00:16:39,750
Uh, I ran a phone check

00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:41,986
on all her incoming calls.

00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,656
Guess where
they were coming from.

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,129
Inside her house.

00:16:53,163 --> 00:16:54,865
BRASS:
So I ran

00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,367
Merlin's, uh, credit card

00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:57,868
with his
permission.

00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,604
Do you know where he was
the night of the murder?

00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,606
Monaco Hotel.

00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:04,441
Room 834.

00:17:04,508 --> 00:17:07,044
Guess who was in
the adjoining room?

00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:09,880
Jane Galloway.

00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,452
Why didn't you tell us
you were staying here?

00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:32,023
I didn't know
she was your victim.

00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:33,157
According
to the front desk

00:17:33,224 --> 00:17:36,093
you placed a call
to Jane Galloway's room at, uh

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,664
9:12 p.m.?
Lasting 21 seconds?

00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,700
May I ask what you two
were talking about?

00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:45,069
Energy.

00:17:45,136 --> 00:17:46,070
( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:17:46,137 --> 00:17:47,138
( <i>gasps</i> )

00:17:50,508 --> 00:17:51,909
Hello?

00:17:51,976 --> 00:17:53,211
I'm calling from the next room.

00:17:53,277 --> 00:17:54,512
I don't mean to alarm you

00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:56,814
but I'm feeling some negative
energy coming from your room.

00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:02,653
S-she wouldn't talk to me.
I-I get that a lot.

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,856
But evidently, you
called her back.

00:18:04,922 --> 00:18:08,493
Yes, she picked up,
and hung up.

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,363
Phone records say that
she received three calls.

00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,364
Twice, I believe.

00:18:13,431 --> 00:18:15,099
The front desk
records also show

00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,468
that she checked
out that night.

00:18:17,535 --> 00:18:20,104
And you checked out
shortly thereafter.

00:18:20,171 --> 00:18:21,606
Why?

00:18:21,672 --> 00:18:25,877
Well, she was suffering,
and I shared her fear.

00:18:27,411 --> 00:18:28,346
Seems my

00:18:28,412 --> 00:18:31,349
intuition was accurate,
as it turns out.

00:18:34,852 --> 00:18:39,090
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:18:39,157 --> 00:18:41,025
You don't believe me, do you?

00:18:41,092 --> 00:18:43,194
Mr. Pearson, I'm
a scientist.

00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:46,063
And I am a clairvoyant.

00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:49,667
You see science
without abstractions.

00:18:49,734 --> 00:18:52,870
I see visions with abstractions.

00:18:52,937 --> 00:18:54,906
Am I less credible than you

00:18:54,972 --> 00:18:56,440
Mr. Grissom?

00:18:56,507 --> 00:19:00,044
These visions that you've had
in the past...

00:19:00,111 --> 00:19:01,345
nothing specific triggered them?

00:19:01,412 --> 00:19:05,750
Sometimes a touch or an object.

00:19:05,817 --> 00:19:07,518
Fear?

00:19:07,585 --> 00:19:09,187
Sure.
And you were

00:19:09,253 --> 00:19:12,323
hoping to heal Jane Galloway?

00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,159
I was only hoping
to comfort her.

These are the only ones
you've experienced?

Yeah... they-they seem
different, though.

You know, I don't
think this thing

00:23:31,516 --> 00:23:32,984
was about sex at all.

00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,820
I think it was about control,

Jane was like his,

from the inside.

00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:48,283
Used Jane Galloway
to emulate the photo?

00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,552
GRISSOM:
Why would he do that?

00:32:50,619 --> 00:32:51,553
Why Nick?

00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,388
Nick has satellite cable, right?

00:32:53,455 --> 00:32:56,691
Lunar Cable-- 150 channels.

00:32:56,758 --> 00:32:57,726
Wait a minute

00:32:57,793 --> 00:33:00,095
we've been doing this
the wrong way.

00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:02,164
We need to see the last tape.

00:33:12,274 --> 00:33:14,376
It's like he, he's...

00:33:14,442 --> 00:33:18,413
he's the kind of guy
I always wanted to, um...

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,548
to be.

00:33:19,614 --> 00:33:22,217
And that's why it's
so great, because...

00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,719
we're friends now.

00:33:24,786 --> 00:33:27,889
I feel like I can count on him,
you know?

00:33:27,956 --> 00:33:28,924
And you know what?

00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,859
I think if it came
right down to it

00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:34,863
he would lay his life down
for me.

00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,298
Ask him.

00:33:36,364 --> 00:33:38,767
A-A-Ask Nick.

00:33:43,004 --> 00:33:45,607

Galloway case.

Who?

00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:32,147
Nigel Crane, the stalker.

00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:33,181

here myself.

refresh my memory.

a few movie channels.

I mean, it's like
I knew you my entire life.

00:38:28,256 --> 00:38:30,692
You installed my cable.

I met you

00:38:34,763 --> 00:38:37,165
I knew we connected.

00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:39,701
Because you told me
what you did

00:38:39,768 --> 00:38:40,735
and I knew exactly

00:38:40,802 --> 00:38:42,437
what you were talking
about, because...

00:38:42,504 --> 00:38:43,438
that's what I do.

00:38:43,505 --> 00:38:44,539
I do it, too.

You know, I observe people.

about them.

Like you watched
Jane Galloway?

00:38:54,015 --> 00:38:55,117
Jane was cool.

00:38:55,183 --> 00:38:59,654
But, um, it would have never
worked out between us, you know.

00:38:59,721 --> 00:39:00,689
Never.

00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,224
I mean, she had
a boyfriend

00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,892
and she was
kind of stuck up.

00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:05,427
And you know what,
she would have

00:39:05,494 --> 00:39:08,130
totally, totally
gotten between us.

00:39:08,196 --> 00:39:13,635
So, you know,
consider that a gift.

00:39:13,702 --> 00:39:15,270
A gift?

00:39:15,337 --> 00:39:16,438
Yeah.

Jane's hair

00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,955
was the wrong color but,
you know

00:39:34,022 --> 00:39:35,791
obviously, I fixed that.

00:39:35,857 --> 00:39:40,228
Because I know how much
you love redheads.

00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,631
You know, you...

00:39:42,697 --> 00:39:46,067
You mentioned her name
in your sleep.

00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:47,969
You watch me sleep?

00:39:56,878 --> 00:39:58,246
Hmm?

00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:01,016
No, no,
it's, uh...

00:40:01,082 --> 00:40:02,317
it's not my job.

00:40:02,384 --> 00:40:04,052
You should know that.

It's the coroner's gig.

No.

We made friends that day

00:40:13,462 --> 00:40:15,931
and every time since

00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:19,968
you just blew me off.

Do you know that?

You just

00:40:23,104 --> 00:40:25,373
completely blanked me.

better than that.

You know?

apart, right?

00:42:24,226 --> 00:42:26,461
Or Jane Galloway,
for that matter.

00:42:26,528 --> 00:42:28,563
I think it was
more about

00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,966
Maslow's Hierarchy
of Needs.

00:42:31,032 --> 00:42:35,303
His premise is that social
beings strive to belong.

00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:36,605
In Nigel's mind

00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,507
Jane Galloway was someone
he could control

00:42:38,573 --> 00:42:39,674
which was okay
for a while

00:42:39,741 --> 00:42:40,675
but you...

00:42:40,742 --> 00:42:43,678
you were someone he
could actually become.

00:42:43,745 --> 00:42:45,413
See, Maslow's
fifth tier

00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,550
of the Hierarchy
is Self-Actualization.

00:42:48,617 --> 00:42:49,951
I am one, and who am I?

00:42:50,018 --> 00:42:51,920
The problem for Nigel
is that you would

00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:53,989
have to die in order
for that to happen.

00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,644
Or else he would.

00:43:01,917 --> 00:43:04,086
25 years to life, Nick.

00:43:04,153 --> 00:43:05,654
It's over.

00:43:07,122 --> 00:43:11,026
It's not over for me.

00:43:11,093 --> 00:43:13,495
It's over for Jane Galloway.

00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:19,595
Well, we should
get back to the lab.

00:43:22,198 --> 00:43:23,566
GRISSOM:
Yeah.

00:43:29,772 --> 00:43:32,341
I am one, and who am I?

00:43:32,408 --> 00:43:34,444
I am one,
and who am I?

00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,479
I am one, and who am I?

00:43:36,546 --> 00:43:38,481
I am one,
and who am I?

00:43:38,548 --> 00:43:41,784
I am one, and who am I?

00:43:41,851 --> 00:43:43,653
And who am I?
