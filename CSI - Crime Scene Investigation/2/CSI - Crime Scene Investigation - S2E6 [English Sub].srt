Caught him red-handed.

What happened here?

00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:22,768
You have anything
to say?

00:01:24,803 --> 00:01:27,072
You don't have to talk to us.

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,109

00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,507
Blood settled
at the time of death.

00:02:12,574 --> 00:02:15,543
Body's been moved
from the murder scene.

Impound his car.

00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,547
Sorry, guys. I lost
you at the fork.

00:02:19,614 --> 00:02:21,549
My bad, Sara.

00:02:21,616 --> 00:02:25,019
Let's process this guy

00:02:25,086 --> 00:02:26,688
shall we?

00:02:26,754 --> 00:02:29,057
Officer, would you
uncuff him, please?!

00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,900
Okay, make like a scarecrow

00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:39,934
for me, partner.

00:02:41,102 --> 00:02:42,871
Arms out, away from your body.

00:02:42,937 --> 00:02:45,774
That's it.
Stay just like that.

00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:53,915
Give me your right foot.

00:02:53,982 --> 00:02:55,984
Other right.

00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:56,985
Put it down.

00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,052
Lift it up.

00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,723
GRISSOM:
Hold still.

00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:07,095
Possible secondary transfer.

00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,299
Got some red fibers.

00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,537
Other foot.

00:03:15,603 --> 00:03:16,604
Lift it up.

00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:17,705
Put it down.

00:03:22,343 --> 00:03:23,678
GRISSOM:
No defensive wounds.

00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,214
No hematomas.

00:03:26,281 --> 00:03:28,716
Victim didn't fight back.

00:03:28,783 --> 00:03:29,984
Probably didn't see it coming.

00:03:32,787 --> 00:03:33,955
Matthew...

00:03:34,022 --> 00:03:36,891
tag that body for special
processing, VIP room.

00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:40,662
Don't wash it till I get there,
and don't touch his fingernails.

00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:54,676
"D.B., Mediterranean Casino,
Women's Spa."

00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:58,746
Body is Shelley Danvers.

00:03:58,813 --> 00:04:01,483
DOB: 10/10/81.

00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:03,518
Employee walked in
to get towels...

00:04:06,354 --> 00:04:08,690
found her here.

00:04:15,196 --> 00:04:19,601
A young woman, healthy,
just reading a magazine

00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:21,936
and all of a sudden she DFOs?

00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:24,205
Done fell out.

00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:26,474
That's what the
night manager says.

00:04:29,177 --> 00:04:30,545
BROWN:
Miss?

00:04:34,549 --> 00:04:36,518
We're from the Crime Lab.

00:04:36,584 --> 00:04:39,487
You found the deceased?

00:04:39,554 --> 00:04:42,123
Yes, I was, um...

00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,525
just getting some towels

00:04:43,591 --> 00:04:45,493
and I walked in
and she was there.

00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,262
WILLOWS:
Hey, Brass...

00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,363
you touch this body?

00:04:48,429 --> 00:04:50,165
Yeah, I was born yesterday.

00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:53,334
Well, it looks as if the sash
may have been tied

00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:55,003
by somebody else.

00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:57,338
Miss...

00:04:57,405 --> 00:04:59,174
you know anything

00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,642
about redressing the body?

00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:01,643
Well, she was naked.

00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:03,211
I-I-I thought
she should be covered.

00:05:03,278 --> 00:05:06,548
Did you move the body here, too?

00:05:06,614 --> 00:05:08,216
Guests were looking in.

00:05:08,283 --> 00:05:09,884
I put a robe on her.

00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:12,687
It's not like
it's a crime or anything.

00:05:12,754 --> 00:05:14,155
Actually, it is.

00:05:14,222 --> 00:05:17,525
Makes us doubt the circumstances
surrounding the victim's death.

00:05:22,096 --> 00:05:23,398
Flour, maybe?

00:05:23,465 --> 00:05:25,633
But what kind?

00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,569
All-purpose?

00:05:27,635 --> 00:05:29,537
Self-rising?

00:05:29,604 --> 00:05:30,872
Pastry?

00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:33,875
Trace will probably
have a better idea.

00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,579
I'll get DNA
to see if
there's bits

00:05:37,645 --> 00:05:39,547
of Ben under
the fingernails.

00:05:39,614 --> 00:05:40,815
What about the neck?

00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,350
Any fibers in the wound?

00:05:42,417 --> 00:05:43,751
You told me to wait for you.

00:05:43,818 --> 00:05:45,220
Well, that hasn't
stopped you yet.

00:05:45,286 --> 00:05:47,422
I did observe
some fibers in the wound.

00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:49,190
I didn't collect them, though.

00:05:49,257 --> 00:05:51,025
Be my guest.

00:05:56,764 --> 00:05:58,166
Yellow.

00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:01,436
Not cotton; satin, maybe.

00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,343
Dress shirt...

00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,944
but no tie.

00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:12,447
Strangled with his own tie?

00:06:14,382 --> 00:06:16,117
Find me on the flour.

00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,255
BROWN:
"Shelley Danvers"--

00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:21,890
appointment 8:00.

00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:23,858
Ms. Marita,
did the deceased

00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,060
use the Jacuzzi facilities
this evening?

00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:27,762
Not that I remember, no.

00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:29,197
( <i>gurney clanging</i> )

00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,965
What? You don't believe me?

00:06:31,032 --> 00:06:33,401
Well, you lied
to us before.

00:06:33,468 --> 00:06:35,403
It's, uh,
not uncommon to drown

00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,538
in a Jacuzzi.

00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,772
Hair gets caught
in the whirl

00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,973
a person
gets dragged under.

00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,708
The hotel wouldn't be
considered unsafe.

00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,477
Well, that didn't happen here.

00:06:42,544 --> 00:06:44,579
She did not drown
on these premises.

00:06:44,646 --> 00:06:47,882
Well, if she did, the coroner
would find water in her lungs

00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:48,983
but it'd be worse

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,685
hearing it from him
than from you.

00:06:50,752 --> 00:06:54,489
Oliver Dunne;
corporate lawyer, father of two.

00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:57,292
You get all that
from his dentals?

00:06:57,358 --> 00:06:58,660
His wife-- widow.

00:06:58,726 --> 00:07:00,695
She came down
to I.D. his property.

00:07:00,762 --> 00:07:01,863
.380s?

00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:02,964
Last one I recovered

00:07:03,031 --> 00:07:05,500
entered through his abdominals

00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:08,903
<i>pierced the liver,</i>
<i>lodged in the oblique.</i>

00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,005
That's not what
killed him, is it?

00:07:11,072 --> 00:07:13,942
We pulled a yellow fiber
out of the neck wound.

00:07:14,008 --> 00:07:15,610
I think it's from his tie.

00:07:15,677 --> 00:07:17,245
You might be right.

00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,347
He died of asphyxiation.

00:07:19,414 --> 00:07:22,150
Tie probably
closed the windpipe.

00:07:22,217 --> 00:07:26,855
<i>Without oxygen, the alveoli</i>
<i>capillaries wither and dry up.</i>

00:07:26,921 --> 00:07:29,257
Whole pulmonary system
shut down.

00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,859
What you may have here

00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:34,028
is the smallest sliver
of the murder weapon.

00:07:34,095 --> 00:07:36,631
Why would a guy shoot
a man three times

00:07:36,698 --> 00:07:39,267
and then strangle him
with his own tie?

00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,102
SIDLE:
I cannot
tell you why

00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,104
but I might be able
to tell you where.

00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,172
A pizza shop.

00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:46,608
The flour on Oliver Dunne
has a low gluten content--

00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,443
seven percent protein--
it's typical

00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,945
of flour used to make cakes,
pizzas, that kind of thing.

00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,047
So, why did you rule out
bakeries?

00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:55,850
Well, the subtype of flour is
another subtype; double zero.

00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:58,520
It's a very fine flour
used only in pizza-baking ovens.

00:07:58,586 --> 00:08:01,523
Oh, and Trace picked up
some oregano in the sample.

00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:04,626
When are you set
to interview Ben?

00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,295
You're the registered owner
of a Lorcin .380.

00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,997
Takes the same
caliber bullet

00:08:09,063 --> 00:08:10,999
as the slugs
we took out of the victim.

00:08:11,065 --> 00:08:13,201
So, I'm going to ask you
one more time

00:08:13,268 --> 00:08:15,170
where's your gun?

00:08:15,236 --> 00:08:16,671
I lost it.

00:08:16,738 --> 00:08:18,339
Do you think
we believe that?

00:08:18,406 --> 00:08:19,340
Do you think...

00:08:19,407 --> 00:08:20,642
Are you employed, Ben?

00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,811
Yeah... yeah, um...

00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:27,015
it's a place called
Dante's Pizzeria.

00:08:27,081 --> 00:08:28,850
It's behind the Strato'.

00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:30,084
You make pizzas?

00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:32,654
Well, I deliver the pizzas.

00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,788
It's too hot back there

00:08:33,855 --> 00:08:35,290
with all the ovens
and stuff.

00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,226
Do you, uh...

00:08:38,293 --> 00:08:42,764
ever come into contact with
the baking flour at Dante's?

00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:46,167
Mostly pizza boxes.

00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,236
Why?

00:08:48,303 --> 00:08:51,139
Well, 'cause we found
flour on the victim

00:08:51,206 --> 00:08:53,174
and it's the
kind that's used

00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,577
to make pizza.

00:08:55,643 --> 00:08:57,112
Can you explain that?

00:08:57,178 --> 00:08:59,347
No.

00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:04,318
Ben, why don't you earn
yourself some points

00:09:04,318 --> 00:09:06,855
by telling me what the science
is going to tell me anyway?

00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,723
Well, I don't have to talk.

00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,695
No... but we're going
to figure it out.

00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,563
Look, if you know so much
about these murders

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,598
what do you need me for?

00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:18,266
Murders?

00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,604
There are more bodies?

00:09:24,706 --> 00:09:27,342
( <i>background</i>

00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:31,646
I feel like I'm mowing a lawn.

00:09:31,713 --> 00:09:33,548
What is that?
A beer can?

00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,817
Soda can?

00:09:35,884 --> 00:09:37,986
Zilch.

00:09:39,821 --> 00:09:41,523
Zilch.

00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:43,658
Don't tell me,
more zilch?

00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:45,827
SIDLE:
Whoa... Whoa.

00:09:45,894 --> 00:09:48,229
Point of disturbance.

00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,831
Hold up.

00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,369
STOKES:
Isolate it.

00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,763
Any more bodies
you want to tell me about?

00:10:23,898 --> 00:10:26,868
No.

00:10:26,935 --> 00:10:29,604
We're going to radar
this whole hillside.

00:10:33,975 --> 00:10:37,712
Sometimes... when I leave
a crime scene

00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:43,051
where I've been particularly
involved with a dead body

00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:47,889
I sit in my car
and it hits me--

00:10:47,956 --> 00:10:50,592
how close I was...

00:10:50,658 --> 00:10:55,730
how heavy the body is...

00:10:55,797 --> 00:10:58,433
the texture of the body...

00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,803
how it feels... you know?

00:11:09,344 --> 00:11:11,246
Mr. Grissom...

00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,051
I'm not a bad person.

00:11:17,118 --> 00:11:19,454
You're not a bad person?

00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,524
Then, what are you?

00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,511
Oh, I hope that's
Shelley Danvers

00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:36,146
the woman
from the hotel spa.

00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:37,214
Yep, she's next.

00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:38,382
Well, it's about time.

00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,817
You guys finished
with day-shift runover, huh?

00:11:40,884 --> 00:11:43,453
I hate it when
you CSI guys
get territorial.

00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,955
Yeah, well,
the victims' families

00:11:45,022 --> 00:11:46,189
hate it
when we don't.

00:11:46,256 --> 00:11:48,892
I'll take it
from here, David.

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,294
Good morning.

00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,162
Catherine.

00:11:52,229 --> 00:11:54,131
No serosanguineous
fluid

00:11:54,197 --> 00:11:56,567
expunged from the mouth
or nose.

00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,668
She didn't drown?

00:11:57,734 --> 00:12:00,804
Rules out your Jacuzzi theory.

00:12:00,871 --> 00:12:02,072
Anything probative?

00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,407
Bright red lividity

00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,142
extending down
the body.

00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,209
From?

00:12:06,276 --> 00:12:08,211
Well, heatstroke possibly.

00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:10,948
Stroke could cause
multiple organ failure

00:12:11,014 --> 00:12:12,249
and if I'm right...

00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:14,885
Cover-up.

00:12:14,952 --> 00:12:17,287
Hey, I still have
to do the post. Catherine?

00:12:17,354 --> 00:12:19,022
Brass, I need you
to get records

00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:21,992
from that hotel spa--
a warrant, if we need it.

00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:23,193
Yep, that's right.

00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,329
Bye.

00:12:25,395 --> 00:12:26,496
Oh, it's on.

00:12:26,563 --> 00:12:29,399
Yeah. Was our girl
staying with anyone
at that hotel?

00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:31,401
Uh, yeah.

00:12:31,468 --> 00:12:33,203
Tina... Tina Kolas.

00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,305
Best friends from
Terre Haute, Indiana.

00:12:35,372 --> 00:12:36,773
Flew here in
a package. Why?

00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,743
We need someone
to give us the truth
about last night.

00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,922
Gil Grissom?

00:12:51,989 --> 00:12:53,390
Father?

00:12:53,457 --> 00:12:55,025
Benjamin's a member
of my parish.

00:12:55,092 --> 00:12:56,894
The officer won't let me
talk to him.

00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,128
He said you were
in charge.

00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,364
Of this crime scene.

00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,566
He needs
spiritual guidance.

00:13:08,138 --> 00:13:10,540
Yeah, I imagine
he does.

00:13:10,607 --> 00:13:12,643
Ah... then you'd have
no problem

00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,244
with my talking to him.

00:13:14,311 --> 00:13:15,245
It's the 11th hour.

00:13:15,312 --> 00:13:16,246
I wouldn't expect

00:13:16,313 --> 00:13:17,748
anything less.
11th hour?

00:13:17,814 --> 00:13:19,550
When the reality
of their actions set in

00:13:19,616 --> 00:13:21,385
they usually turn
to religion.

00:13:21,451 --> 00:13:23,453
Can you think
of a better time?

00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:33,463
Okay, hold it.

00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,464
That's enough.

00:13:34,531 --> 00:13:35,532
Let's dust him.

00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,818
No ligature marks.

00:13:54,885 --> 00:13:56,753
SIDLE:
Different from
the first guy.

00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,556
See if this laceration
on this guy's forehead

00:13:59,623 --> 00:14:01,892
is consistent with
the kid's shovel.

00:14:03,393 --> 00:14:05,028
Hey...

00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:06,797
I feel a wallet
here.

00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,471
Ramirez

00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:15,706
Kenny.

00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,508
A 25-year-old Latino
and a 42-year-old white guy?

00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:20,277
SIDLE:
Strangers.

00:14:20,344 --> 00:14:22,212
Doesn't make sense.
There's no connection.

00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,816
Well, it obviously
wasn't a robbery.

00:14:25,883 --> 00:14:27,351
STOKES:
Hey, O'Riley.

00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:29,186
What's the matter, man--
A.C. not working?

00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:30,721
I was on with Dispatch.

00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:34,358
Oliver Dunne's car was
just found by the Highway Patrol

00:14:34,424 --> 00:14:36,894
abandoned at an AvCon station
off 215.

00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,531
They didn't happen
to find another car
there, did they?

00:14:41,598 --> 00:14:43,533
Yeah.

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,803
Registered to a "Ramirez."

00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,006
Yeah...
gas station.

00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:01,051
WILLOWS:
And you can verify
that when Shelley went

00:15:01,118 --> 00:15:02,786
to the hotel spa last night

00:15:02,853 --> 00:15:05,022
she was going to use
the dry sauna?

00:15:05,088 --> 00:15:06,256
We'd been drinking
apple martinis

00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:07,257
for three days straight.

00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:09,393
Shelley said the sauna
would detox her

00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:10,761
you know, clean her out.

00:15:14,464 --> 00:15:15,465
Cath.

00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:18,502
Whose shirt is this?

00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:21,505
Mine. Shelley and I got
in a fight over it.

00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:22,739
When?

00:15:22,806 --> 00:15:23,740
Yesterday.

00:15:23,807 --> 00:15:25,842
I caught her trying it on
and I said

00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:27,611
"Give it back,"
and then we started

00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:29,346
fighting over it,
you know, tug of war

00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:31,181
and the whole thing
ripped right in two.

00:15:31,248 --> 00:15:32,683
We fell back laughing.

00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:34,318
( <i>laughing and squealing</i> )

00:15:35,619 --> 00:15:37,688
I'd give anything to have
her back.

00:15:37,754 --> 00:15:39,089
We're going to take

00:15:39,156 --> 00:15:41,058
this shirt,
if you don't mind.

00:15:41,124 --> 00:15:43,393
No, go ahead,
if it'll help.

00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,828
You said you have proof

00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,797
that Shelley used
the dry sauna.

00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,532
She called down from this phone.

00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:50,200
Do they tape phone calls here?

00:15:50,267 --> 00:15:52,035
WILLOWS:
Hotel surveillance
would love that.

00:15:52,102 --> 00:15:55,872
You're sure she used
that phone to make
the appointment?

00:15:55,939 --> 00:15:56,840
Yeah.

00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,312
We're going to take this
as well.

00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,749
Okay... but it doesn't have
anything on it.

00:16:05,816 --> 00:16:07,317
Well, that's okay.

00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:08,819
We do magic.

00:16:10,487 --> 00:16:11,822
Two men were shot
and killed

00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,257
and you didn't
see anything?

00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:14,758
Sorry.

00:16:14,825 --> 00:16:17,261
You don't just miss
something like that.
What was going on?

00:16:17,327 --> 00:16:19,630
A friend of mine came
with his new car.

00:16:19,696 --> 00:16:21,465
We took it
for a drive.

00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:22,799
I'm afraid my boss
will find out.

00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:23,967
I was only gone
five minutes.

00:16:24,034 --> 00:16:25,702
Okay, all right.

00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:26,770
Just walk us through it.

00:16:26,837 --> 00:16:28,939
When did you know
there'd been a crime committed?

00:16:29,006 --> 00:16:31,508
Well, my buddy
dropped me back here

00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,744
and I noticed
these two cars.

00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,345
I went to check
them out.

00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,722
Oh, my God.

00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:50,294
I don't see any blood.

00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,495
Yeah, I hosed
it down.

00:16:51,562 --> 00:16:52,362
You what?

00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:53,497
It was freakin' me out.

00:17:04,675 --> 00:17:06,009
H-Hello?

00:17:06,076 --> 00:17:07,644
Mr. Grissom?

00:17:07,711 --> 00:17:09,046
Uh...

00:17:11,548 --> 00:17:14,651
They told me out front
I'd find you here.

00:17:18,522 --> 00:17:20,958
I don't see your,
uh... visitor's badge.

00:17:21,024 --> 00:17:22,392
Priest's collar.

00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,194
People trust it.

00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:27,497
Most people.

00:17:27,564 --> 00:17:29,666
Even lapsed Catholics.

00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:34,071
What makes you think, uh...
I was ever a Catholic?

00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:36,673
First time we met,
you called me "Father."

00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,975
Only Romans do that.

00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:41,178
Everybody else,
it's "Reverend"
or "Minister."

00:17:41,245 --> 00:17:42,279
I wanted to know

00:17:42,346 --> 00:17:45,249
how your investigation
against Ben is going.

00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:46,984
This is his car.

00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,253
You know,
you really shouldn't be here.

00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,289
I didn't come here to tamper
with your evidence.

00:18:03,901 --> 00:18:06,570
He was a good kid,
all through school.

00:18:06,637 --> 00:18:07,571
Still comes

00:18:07,638 --> 00:18:11,208
to Mass
every Sunday.

00:18:11,275 --> 00:18:14,077
If he has a problem...

00:18:14,144 --> 00:18:15,712
it's trying to please people.

00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:19,249
Is that a problem?

00:18:19,316 --> 00:18:20,717
It can be.

00:18:31,495 --> 00:18:33,497
This Luminol reveals

00:18:33,564 --> 00:18:34,998
any dried
blood spots.

00:18:56,687 --> 00:18:58,989
He wouldn't do this.

00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:01,792
I believe the car.

00:19:04,194 --> 00:19:09,466
"To whom much is given,
much will be expected."

00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:15,772
I leave you to your work.

00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:24,681
I told you we have
no record Shelley Danvers

00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:26,516
specifically used
the dry sauna.

00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,518
WILLOWS:
That's okay, 'cause we do.

00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:31,154
ESDA can read
this blank paper

00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:33,357
see what's
written on it.

00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:34,358
Up to 14 layers.

00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,360
BROWN:
Sometimes a simple
flashlight

00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:37,694
will do the trick.

00:19:39,696 --> 00:19:41,098
That's Miss Danvers'
handwriting.

00:19:41,164 --> 00:19:42,132
We confirm that.

00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:43,166
So she took a dry sauna.

00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:44,167
What does that prove?

00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:48,405
She died of a heat stroke.

00:19:48,472 --> 00:19:50,107
The Coroner
just called in

00:19:50,173 --> 00:19:52,743
with the results
of his final post.

00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:55,078
Your sauna's kept
in the optimal condition

00:19:55,145 --> 00:19:56,446
for heat stroke--
182 °F.

00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,117
That could kill a person
if you left them

00:20:00,183 --> 00:20:01,785
longer than
two straight hours.

00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:03,854
Especially if no one
checks up on them.

00:20:03,921 --> 00:20:05,789
A hotel employee
is supposed to check

00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:07,457
on the various saunas
every 15 minutes.

00:20:07,524 --> 00:20:09,960
Hotel regulations,
right?

00:20:10,027 --> 00:20:11,485
We, uh,

00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,667
we got a copy of
the check-up sheet.

00:20:17,901 --> 00:20:23,151
No hotel employee
checked in on the sauna after 7:30 p.m.

00:20:23,151 --> 00:20:25,509
So, Shelley was in here
from 8:00 until...

00:20:25,575 --> 00:20:27,878
what time did
you call 9-1-1?

00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:32,249
I, um...

00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:33,683
<i>I came in at closing.</i>

00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,684
<i>10:00.</i>

00:20:34,751 --> 00:20:37,521
Miss?

00:20:37,587 --> 00:20:38,555
Miss?

00:20:38,622 --> 00:20:39,423
Oh, my God.

00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,525
You moved her
into the locker room?

00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:43,760
Put the robe on her?

00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:46,063
I was just trying to protect
the hotel.

00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:48,131
From negligent homicide.

00:20:48,198 --> 00:20:51,234
They drill into us that
the reputation of this hotel

00:20:51,301 --> 00:20:53,904
is everything.

00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,739
Murder scene
was compromised.

00:20:55,806 --> 00:20:57,707
Pump jockey wasn't
very helpful

00:20:57,774 --> 00:21:00,901
but bullets pulled
from Victim One

00:21:00,901 --> 00:21:02,379
and Victim Two.

00:21:02,446 --> 00:21:03,480
Identical striations.

00:21:03,547 --> 00:21:05,348
Bullets in both
victims were fired

00:21:05,415 --> 00:21:06,817
by the exact same weapon.

00:21:06,883 --> 00:21:07,818
A Lorcin .380.

00:21:07,884 --> 00:21:08,952
The same pistol

00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:11,388
registered to
a Benjamin Jennings.

00:21:11,455 --> 00:21:13,123
SIDLE:
P.D. can prove through
credit cards

00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,858
that Ben frequents
the AvCon gas stations

00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:16,026
where both vics
were killed.

00:21:16,093 --> 00:21:17,060
STOKES:
And we can prove

00:21:17,127 --> 00:21:18,895
he transported those bodies
in his vehicle

00:21:18,962 --> 00:21:20,197
based on the blood
you found.

00:21:20,263 --> 00:21:21,798
And fibers.

00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:25,736
<i>I recovered a burgundy fiber</i>

00:21:25,802 --> 00:21:27,204
<i>from the sock of Victim One.</i>

00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,573
Found the same fiber
on the sock of Victim Two.

00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:33,143
We ID'd the fibers
using the FTIR.

00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,412
It's a polymer commonly used
in vehicle carpeting.

00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:36,913
So we went back

00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,914
to Ben's car.

00:21:40,951 --> 00:21:42,219
STOKES:
<i>They're identical.</i>

00:21:42,285 --> 00:21:43,320
We got the Master
Standards

00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:44,421
from the car
manufacturer.

00:21:44,488 --> 00:21:46,590
The assigned name
for the material

00:21:46,656 --> 00:21:48,525
is "12-ounce Merlot Trialon."

00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,430
Bottom line...
he killed them.

00:21:53,497 --> 00:21:56,666
Good work, you guys.

00:21:56,733 --> 00:22:00,270
Very good.

00:22:00,337 --> 00:22:02,739
But you haven't proved murder.

00:22:02,806 --> 00:22:03,740
You've proved burial.

00:22:03,807 --> 00:22:05,609
Excuse me?

00:22:05,675 --> 00:22:07,978
Victim blood on his clothes...

00:22:08,044 --> 00:22:09,279
under his nails.

00:22:09,346 --> 00:22:11,181
From burying them.

00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:14,184
Victim blood in his car?

00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:16,453
He transported them.

00:22:17,821 --> 00:22:18,855
Show me the gun

00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:20,857
with Ben's prints
on it.

00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:23,460
Gun shot residue,
the ligature, the...

00:22:23,527 --> 00:22:26,630
The holes in Christ's hands,
Doubting Thomas?

00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:28,365
Yes. Empirical evidence.

00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:29,866
St. Thomas was ahead

00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:31,168
of us all.

00:22:31,234 --> 00:22:33,270
Does this have anything to do

00:22:33,336 --> 00:22:36,673
with the priest that's been
coming around here?

00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,674
No.

00:22:37,741 --> 00:22:40,043
It has to do with the evidence.

00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:43,480
It's our job to present the D.A.
with the best evidence possible.

00:22:43,547 --> 00:22:44,481
Let a jury decide.

00:22:44,548 --> 00:22:47,617
Anything else,
we're playing judge.

00:22:47,684 --> 00:22:51,755
The evidence doesn't get
any better than this.

00:23:00,068 --> 00:23:01,364
Okay. Ship it.

00:23:01,431 --> 00:23:02,999
Show it to the D.A.

00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:06,069
Right.

00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:13,886
Anyone up
for breakfast?

00:23:13,953 --> 00:23:16,689
I'm up for a shower
and tucking my daughter in.

00:23:16,756 --> 00:23:19,025
Football-- wide-screen.

00:23:19,092 --> 00:23:21,094
Well, I guess I'll go
see Tina alone.

00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:25,298
Hotel tells me she's down
playing quarter slots.

00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:29,235
I thought we
solved this case.

00:23:29,302 --> 00:23:30,370
What'd you get?

00:23:30,436 --> 00:23:31,971
Well, my guy in the hotel lounge

00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:34,674
tells me that Tina and Shelley
were having a catfight

00:23:34,741 --> 00:23:36,075
over some dude named Jeremy

00:23:36,142 --> 00:23:37,610
the day she died.

00:23:37,677 --> 00:23:39,379
That's probably how the shirt

00:23:39,445 --> 00:23:41,080
really got ripped.

00:23:41,147 --> 00:23:42,115
Don't ring her bell

00:23:42,181 --> 00:23:44,384
till we re-examine our case.

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,886
Misunderstood the priest?

00:23:46,953 --> 00:23:48,588
How?

00:23:48,655 --> 00:23:50,089
I looked deeper
into the evidence.

00:23:50,156 --> 00:23:52,325
I should have looked deeper
into Ben's character.

00:23:52,392 --> 00:23:55,094
STOKES:
"Benjamin Corey Jennings."

00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:56,829
Nonviolent crimes.

00:23:58,164 --> 00:24:01,567
"Roger Jennings...
armed robbery.

00:24:01,634 --> 00:24:03,970
"Past convictions,
breaking and entering

00:24:04,037 --> 00:24:07,774
"assault with
great bodily harm.

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,777
Paroled 9/27/2000."

00:24:10,843 --> 00:24:12,679
This guy is hard-core.

00:24:12,745 --> 00:24:14,747
He's looking
at his third strike here.

00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,018
What's going on?

00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:25,291
You know how we pushed him
to file on Ben?

00:24:25,358 --> 00:24:26,593
Yeah.

00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:29,095
We might have been wrong.

00:24:29,162 --> 00:24:31,431
Tell me
about your brother.

00:24:36,235 --> 00:24:38,638
We know that you only
buried the bodies.

00:24:38,705 --> 00:24:41,374
So, what happened?

00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:45,678
Did he threaten you?

00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:51,217
Ben?

00:25:11,204 --> 00:25:13,239
Did you learn to throw
pizzas in prison, Roger?

00:25:16,743 --> 00:25:19,178
Who the hell are you guys?

00:25:19,245 --> 00:25:21,193
Get out of my kitchen.

00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,462
"Roger Jennings--

00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:25,731
armed robbery,
breaking and entering."

00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:28,967
You sound like the kind
of guy it wouldn't be
a big jump to murder.

00:25:29,776 --> 00:25:30,977
What is this?

00:25:32,112 --> 00:25:34,147
Your first stop
the AvCon gas station.

00:25:34,214 --> 00:25:35,882
See these two guys?

00:25:35,949 --> 00:25:37,751
Nope.

00:25:37,818 --> 00:25:40,587
Don't know what
you're talking about.

00:25:40,654 --> 00:25:42,589
My little brother
got me this job.

00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,890
I'm staying clean.

00:25:43,957 --> 00:25:44,991
Suppose I told you

00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:46,793
your brother said
you did these guys.

00:25:49,729 --> 00:25:51,498
He wouldn't do that.

00:25:51,565 --> 00:25:53,900
You did it directly after work

00:25:53,967 --> 00:25:57,237
using a .380 pistol

00:25:57,304 --> 00:25:58,538
and then you strangled

00:25:58,605 --> 00:26:00,607
one of the victims
with his own tie.

00:26:12,986 --> 00:26:14,221
Ben did it.

00:26:15,622 --> 00:26:16,857
Did you witness this?

00:26:16,923 --> 00:26:19,125
He told me about it.

00:26:19,192 --> 00:26:21,361
Look what I did--
I just lost my head.

00:26:22,195 --> 00:26:23,630
What am I supposed to do now?

00:26:23,697 --> 00:26:26,166
I'm on a short line, all right?

00:26:26,233 --> 00:26:27,968
You're on your own, Ben.

00:26:28,034 --> 00:26:29,110
Roger, you've
got to help me.

00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,036
You know
I can't.

00:26:30,036 --> 00:26:31,304
What am I going to do?

00:26:31,371 --> 00:26:32,472
Huh?

00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:33,473
It's your mess.

00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,774
You got to deal with it.

00:26:34,841 --> 00:26:37,477
What started the beef
with the victims?

00:26:37,544 --> 00:26:38,612
I don't know.

00:26:38,678 --> 00:26:40,213
Tempers, I guess.

00:26:42,015 --> 00:26:43,016
Hey!

00:26:43,617 --> 00:26:45,051
Hey, man! I was here first.

00:26:45,118 --> 00:26:46,820
You want to
wait your turn?

00:26:46,887 --> 00:26:48,889
What are you
going to do, huh?

00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:53,760
Bystander gets
a little too nosy...

00:26:57,898 --> 00:26:59,733
and he gets it, too.

00:27:01,268 --> 00:27:02,969
The perpetrator's
hands left flour

00:27:03,036 --> 00:27:04,504
on the victim's face.

00:27:04,571 --> 00:27:06,306
This was not
from a gunshot.

00:27:06,373 --> 00:27:09,142
This was something a
little more intimate.

00:27:20,086 --> 00:27:22,923
When a person changes
his mode of murder

00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:24,357
from pistol to ligature

00:27:24,424 --> 00:27:26,159
it's for one of
two reasons--

00:27:26,226 --> 00:27:30,430
entertainment...
or necessity.

00:27:30,497 --> 00:27:32,199
Which was it for you?

00:27:32,265 --> 00:27:33,366
Neither.

00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:36,269
I told you,
Ben strangled that guy.

00:27:36,336 --> 00:27:38,605
The flour said you did.

00:27:40,073 --> 00:27:42,175
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:27:43,844 --> 00:27:46,880
Anything on the list
besides the tie?

00:27:46,947 --> 00:27:48,615
Nope.

00:27:50,951 --> 00:27:52,018
Hey, guys.

00:27:52,085 --> 00:27:53,520
You can go ahead
and take off.

00:27:53,587 --> 00:27:54,521
I think we got it.

00:27:54,588 --> 00:27:55,655
Thanks.

00:28:02,262 --> 00:28:03,463
Whoa.

00:28:18,612 --> 00:28:19,779
Hey.

00:28:19,846 --> 00:28:21,014
Dry cleaning.

00:28:21,081 --> 00:28:22,549
The trailer's
low-rent.

00:28:22,616 --> 00:28:24,417
Dry cleaning's expensive.

00:28:36,563 --> 00:28:38,465
Sara?

00:28:38,532 --> 00:28:40,567
This man's not
as smart as he thinks.

00:28:40,634 --> 00:28:42,702
Dry cleaning
bakes in blood stains.

00:28:44,404 --> 00:28:45,338
Could be red sauce.

00:28:45,405 --> 00:28:46,373
Oh, now
you're cautious.

00:28:46,439 --> 00:28:48,008
I'm just
trying to put

00:28:48,074 --> 00:28:49,910
our mistake to good use.

00:28:49,976 --> 00:28:52,179
Okay. You wanna...

00:28:52,245 --> 00:28:56,516
check the perimeter and I'll see
if we have blood stains or red sauce.

00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:57,751
Okay.

00:30:10,257 --> 00:30:11,725
Hemoglobin.

00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:13,460
Take a look at this.

00:30:19,332 --> 00:30:20,333
Nick?

00:30:22,769 --> 00:30:24,337
Hey, Nick.

00:30:59,506 --> 00:31:00,607
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:03,677
( <i>gunshots</i> )

00:31:07,314 --> 00:31:09,249
jammed, huh?

00:31:09,316 --> 00:31:11,418
Get anything instructive?

00:31:11,485 --> 00:31:12,986
Possibly.

00:31:13,053 --> 00:31:14,654
Blood from Jennings's
denim shirt.

00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:20,927
Is the printer out of ink?

00:31:20,994 --> 00:31:22,128
"ND, ND, ND."

00:31:22,195 --> 00:31:23,630
It means "None Detected."

00:31:23,697 --> 00:31:25,665
The dry cleaning
baked in the blood

00:31:25,732 --> 00:31:27,067
and it also degraded it

00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:28,735
to a degree that I
can't get a result.

00:31:28,802 --> 00:31:31,004
Try again. This could be
victim blood. Try again.

00:31:31,071 --> 00:31:32,005
I have tried.

00:31:32,072 --> 00:31:33,707
It's chemically
impossible, Sara.

00:31:33,773 --> 00:31:35,475
Nothing from nothing
is nothing.

00:31:42,883 --> 00:31:45,685
The striations
are different. See?

00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,288
There's no way I can say

00:31:48,355 --> 00:31:50,423
that the bullets
taken from the victims

00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,125
were fired by Jennings's gun.

00:31:54,361 --> 00:31:56,563
So, he altered
the barrel somehow.

00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:59,966
Yeah. Changed how the bullet
relates to the barrel

00:32:00,033 --> 00:32:03,637
so when the bullet emerges,
its fine stria are altered.

00:32:03,703 --> 00:32:05,872
Any idea what he used?

00:32:07,941 --> 00:32:09,176
Whatever it was...

00:32:09,242 --> 00:32:10,644
did the job.

00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,878
My evidence
is no better.

00:32:11,945 --> 00:32:13,613
Total wash.

00:32:16,316 --> 00:32:18,251
We present this
to the D.A.

00:32:18,318 --> 00:32:22,322
Unfortunately, we've had
this discussion before.

00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:23,990
The guilty brother's
going to walk.

00:32:56,485 --> 00:32:59,276
He's never been in
any real trouble before.

00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,693
They'll go easy on him.

00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:08,468
The bullet jammed
in the feed, didn't it?

00:33:18,778 --> 00:33:21,381
So, it <i>was</i> necessity.

00:33:33,901 --> 00:33:36,604
Wait, are you saying Shelley
didn't die in the sauna?

00:33:36,671 --> 00:33:37,905
She died of
heat stroke.

00:33:37,972 --> 00:33:41,475
But the stroke covered up an
underlying medical catastrophe.

00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:42,743
Like what?

00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:43,945
Shell was always healthy.

00:33:44,011 --> 00:33:45,913
She went into
anaphylactic shock.

00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,182
Coroner says some
of the indicators

00:33:48,249 --> 00:33:49,784
are the same
as a stroke:

00:33:49,851 --> 00:33:52,353
renal failure, cerebral edema.

00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,355
We missed it until Captain Brass

00:33:54,422 --> 00:33:57,525
brought your room service
records to our attention.

00:33:57,592 --> 00:33:59,360
I don't understand.

00:33:59,427 --> 00:34:02,129
Well, maybe this will help--
the travel agency contract

00:34:02,196 --> 00:34:03,664
you and Shelley signed.

00:34:03,731 --> 00:34:06,133
Under "allergic reactions
to foods" for Shelley Danvers--

00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,768
shellfish.

00:34:07,835 --> 00:34:09,871
As her best friend,
you would know that.

00:34:09,937 --> 00:34:12,273
BRASS:
And then we have this

00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,542
from the hotel computer
for your room

00:34:14,609 --> 00:34:16,043
7:01 p.m., on the day:

00:34:17,445 --> 00:34:20,047
"A Taste from the Sea

00:34:20,114 --> 00:34:21,949
"a lovely tureen
of mild bisque

00:34:22,016 --> 00:34:24,051
with pureed bits
of Maine lobster."

00:34:24,118 --> 00:34:27,021
Pureed, two bowls.

00:34:27,088 --> 00:34:28,656
She didn't know

00:34:28,723 --> 00:34:31,092
what she was eating
when it arrived, did she?

00:34:33,261 --> 00:34:36,264
Because she didn't
order it; you did.

00:34:39,818 --> 00:34:42,970
We've got a machine
known as the ESDA machine

00:34:43,037 --> 00:34:46,807
<i>which can read pen imprints.</i>

00:34:46,874 --> 00:34:48,543
Well, the machine isolated this.

00:34:49,577 --> 00:34:51,546
"Jeremy, drinks, 10:00."

00:34:51,612 --> 00:34:53,014
Shelley made that date.

00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,549
That's her handwriting.

00:34:55,983 --> 00:34:58,386
Were you in the room
when Jeremy called?

00:34:58,452 --> 00:35:00,488
I answered the phone.

00:35:00,555 --> 00:35:02,156
He asked for her.

00:35:02,223 --> 00:35:05,193
You killed her over a guy
you two met at a bar?

00:35:05,259 --> 00:35:07,695
I didn't mean to kill her.

00:35:07,762 --> 00:35:10,865
I thought that she
would just have an
allergic reaction

00:35:10,932 --> 00:35:13,067
and she wouldn't be able
to make her date that night

00:35:13,134 --> 00:35:14,335
like, get hives or something.

00:35:14,402 --> 00:35:16,837
Well, her allergy kicked in
in the sauna

00:35:16,904 --> 00:35:19,207
under the worst
possible conditions--

00:35:19,273 --> 00:35:25,780
<i>trachea... larynx...</i>
<i>tongue swelled.</i>

00:35:25,846 --> 00:35:28,216
Her pressure got so low

00:35:28,282 --> 00:35:30,117
her blood quit running
through her organs.

00:35:30,184 --> 00:35:32,053
They shut down.

00:35:37,425 --> 00:35:39,493
I didn't even like the guy.

00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,932
I just...
I didn't want to be left out.

00:35:48,836 --> 00:35:52,740
BRASS:
Miss Kolas, you're
under arrest.

00:35:52,807 --> 00:35:55,142
Hey.

00:35:55,209 --> 00:35:56,711
D.A.'s looking for you.

00:35:56,777 --> 00:35:59,146
About?
What, you think I
read your messages?

00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,251
"Top secret and urgent"?

00:36:03,317 --> 00:36:04,785
It's a gift,
reading upside down.

00:36:04,852 --> 00:36:06,888
<i>The Las Vegas District Attorney
is reportedly...</i>

00:36:06,954 --> 00:36:08,823
<i>preparing to file
homicide charges...</i>

00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,592
<i>against Benjamin Corey Jennings</i>

00:36:11,659 --> 00:36:13,494
<i>in the so-called
Burial Murders case.</i>

00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:16,497
<i>Jennings has been in police
custody for the last...</i>

00:36:16,564 --> 00:36:18,299
Guess we know what
she was calling about.

00:36:18,366 --> 00:36:21,502
<i>...since he was caught burying
the first victim, Oliver Dunne</i>

00:36:21,569 --> 00:36:23,104
<i>in the National Forest.</i>

00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:24,939
Don't you have enough cases
over at CSI

00:36:25,006 --> 00:36:26,674
now you're going
to start telling me

00:36:26,741 --> 00:36:28,309
which ones I should
take to court?

00:36:28,376 --> 00:36:30,344
There isn't one piece
of evidence that says

00:36:30,411 --> 00:36:32,313
that kid was even present
at the murders.

00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,347
As a matter of fact

00:36:33,414 --> 00:36:34,916
this is why
I was hunting you.

00:36:34,982 --> 00:36:37,118
Jennings brought it in
about an hour ago.

00:36:37,185 --> 00:36:39,053
Chain of custody;
I can't touch it.

00:36:40,888 --> 00:36:42,857
The first victim was
ligatured, right?

00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:54,335
Jennings says his little brother
asked him to hide the tie.

00:36:54,402 --> 00:36:55,703
Well, how convenient.

00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,672
The older brother brings it in

00:36:57,738 --> 00:37:01,709
explaining why his epithelials
are all over the murder weapon.

00:37:01,776 --> 00:37:04,779
A jury doesn't understand
epi-whatevers, okay?

00:37:04,845 --> 00:37:09,050
They understand a twisty tie and
blood all over Ben's car seat.

00:37:09,116 --> 00:37:10,184
He set up his brother.

00:37:10,251 --> 00:37:12,520
Oh, come on, Grissom,
they're both part of it

00:37:12,587 --> 00:37:14,455
and if I can get
one of them, I will.

00:37:14,522 --> 00:37:15,790
He's a good kid, Robin.

00:37:15,857 --> 00:37:18,726
He hero-worships his brother,
but he's a good kid.

00:37:18,793 --> 00:37:19,861
Yeah?

00:37:19,927 --> 00:37:22,730
Then his epithelials
shouldn't be on that tie.

00:37:24,866 --> 00:37:26,300
Explain how bits

00:37:26,367 --> 00:37:28,769
of your skin
got on the ligature

00:37:28,836 --> 00:37:31,038
used to strangle
that victim.

00:37:31,105 --> 00:37:32,573
I don't know.

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,711
Your brother brought this in
to the District Attorney.

00:37:40,848 --> 00:37:42,049
What?

00:37:42,116 --> 00:37:43,651
He's framing you.

00:37:43,718 --> 00:37:46,187
GRISSOM:
Unless you can tell us

00:37:46,254 --> 00:37:49,857
how your epithelials
got on that tie.

00:37:49,924 --> 00:37:52,894
I don't know.

00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,262
I swear I don't know.

00:37:54,328 --> 00:37:57,398
I... he... I just picked up
the bodies at his place.

00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,668
Grab that guy's tie, little bro.

00:38:00,735 --> 00:38:02,970
I like that thing.

00:38:08,976 --> 00:38:10,778
Bury them deep, all right?

00:38:10,845 --> 00:38:12,380
You get into any trouble

00:38:12,446 --> 00:38:14,482
you don't have to say
anything, all right?

00:38:14,549 --> 00:38:15,516
I'm counting on you.

00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:18,386
Yeah, yeah, man,
I'm there all the way.

00:38:18,452 --> 00:38:21,689
Go, get out of here.

00:38:21,756 --> 00:38:23,391
Go on.

00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:26,894
I got to ask...

00:38:26,961 --> 00:38:30,097
how does somebody bury
two bodies as a favor?

00:38:30,164 --> 00:38:32,099
'Cause he's my brother.

00:38:33,818 --> 00:38:37,610
He told...
He told me that if I didn't talk...

00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,840
to you guys and if he didn't talk,
then this would all just blow over;

00:38:39,907 --> 00:38:41,409
it'd all just go away.

00:38:41,475 --> 00:38:43,110
You're looking at
two counts of Murder

00:38:43,177 --> 00:38:45,413
Special Circumstances.

00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:47,215
The best you can hope for

00:38:47,281 --> 00:38:50,218
is life
without parole.

00:38:50,284 --> 00:38:53,521
I don't... I don't think
I can do that kind of time.

00:38:55,556 --> 00:38:57,725
Do you have
any physical evidence

00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,228
linking your brother
to the murders?

00:39:00,294 --> 00:39:01,963
Anything?

00:39:57,218 --> 00:40:00,087
I know that we've arrested
the wrong brother.

00:40:07,595 --> 00:40:09,931
He came to see you as soon
as Ben was in custody.

00:40:12,934 --> 00:40:16,871
I tried to help without
breaking my vows.

00:40:20,908 --> 00:40:24,712
We both have jobs
that begin after the crime.

00:40:24,779 --> 00:40:27,114
After the sin.

00:40:27,181 --> 00:40:31,052
Some people would call that
a career in futility.

00:40:31,118 --> 00:40:34,222
Some call it a vocation.

00:40:37,124 --> 00:40:39,026
100 years ago

00:40:39,093 --> 00:40:42,330
we didn't have the technology
for fingerprints.

00:40:42,396 --> 00:40:44,866
15 years ago,
we didn't have DNA.

00:40:44,932 --> 00:40:48,369
Hopefully one day,
we'll have foolproof means

00:40:48,436 --> 00:40:52,406
by which to put the right man
in jail in this case.

00:40:52,473 --> 00:40:55,243
Someday, we won't need jails.

00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:02,550
I celebrate mass
every Thursday night, 7:00.

00:41:04,785 --> 00:41:07,488
Thank you...

00:41:07,555 --> 00:41:10,625
but...

00:41:10,691 --> 00:41:12,760
no.

00:41:12,827 --> 00:41:15,329
You don't believe?

00:41:15,396 --> 00:41:18,399
In religion?

00:41:18,466 --> 00:41:21,002
I believe in God, in science...

00:41:21,068 --> 00:41:23,638
in Sunday supper.

00:41:23,704 --> 00:41:27,074
I don't believe in rules
that tell me how I should live.

00:41:27,141 --> 00:41:30,011
Even if they're
handed down by God?

00:41:30,077 --> 00:41:32,079
How many crusades were fought
in the name of God?

00:41:32,146 --> 00:41:33,481
How many people died

00:41:33,548 --> 00:41:36,751
because of someone's religion?

00:41:36,817 --> 00:41:39,587
Fanaticism; not religion.

00:41:39,654 --> 00:41:41,189
Semantics.

00:41:41,255 --> 00:41:43,991
They're still dead.

00:41:44,058 --> 00:41:47,195
I'm sorry about Ben, Father.

00:41:50,565 --> 00:41:53,968
You still suffer
like a Catholic.

00:41:56,003 --> 00:41:58,005
Light bulb goes out

00:41:58,072 --> 00:42:00,608
other people fix it,
get a new one.

00:42:00,675 --> 00:42:03,811
Light bulb goes out
for the Catholic

00:42:03,878 --> 00:42:05,646
he stands in the dark

00:42:05,713 --> 00:42:08,282
says, "What
did I do wrong?"

00:42:10,351 --> 00:42:12,753
That guilt's not in me anymore.

00:42:28,102 --> 00:42:29,370
Hey.

00:42:29,437 --> 00:42:30,938
Oh.

00:42:31,005 --> 00:42:33,174
You're going
to be getting a call

00:42:33,241 --> 00:42:35,877
from the local papers
about spa safety.

00:42:35,943 --> 00:42:38,212
Spa safety?

00:42:38,279 --> 00:42:41,082
We had a victim die
of an allergic reaction

00:42:41,148 --> 00:42:42,550
at the Mediterranean.

00:42:42,617 --> 00:42:46,554
Some foul play;
some negligence.

00:42:46,621 --> 00:42:48,356
So what am I
supposed to say?

00:42:48,422 --> 00:42:50,558
That it was an
isolated incident...

00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:52,693
that in no way
should it be a mark

00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,563
against the Strip's other
fine hotel-casinos.

00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:58,332
CSI supports Las Vegas.

00:42:58,399 --> 00:42:59,901
Bottom line.

00:43:07,742 --> 00:43:09,310
Need some help in here!

00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:16,918
Hold his head!
Hold his head!

00:43:16,984 --> 00:43:18,653
I can't stop
the bleeding.

00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:20,254
Oh, no, no, no.

00:43:20,321 --> 00:43:21,389
How did this happen?!

00:43:21,455 --> 00:43:23,424
Incisor.
He used his teeth.

00:43:23,491 --> 00:43:24,725
Clamp down.

00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,528
Keep him with us.

00:43:27,595 --> 00:43:28,696
Get out of the way!

00:43:28,763 --> 00:43:30,565
Out of the way!
Sir, step back.

00:43:30,631 --> 00:43:32,400
Sir.
He's bleeding out.

00:43:32,466 --> 00:43:33,768
He's bleeding out here.

00:43:33,834 --> 00:43:35,303
We need to stop this.

00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:37,305
Compression.
Keep him with us.

00:43:37,371 --> 00:43:38,773
Get the head up.

00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,275
We're losing him,
we're losing him.

00:43:46,734 --> 00:43:49,717
I'm going to pronounce.
22:04.
