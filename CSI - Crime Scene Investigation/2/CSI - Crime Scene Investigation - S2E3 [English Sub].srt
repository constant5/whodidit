- You're late.
- Thursday night. Traffic on the Strip.

00:00:33,807 --> 00:00:35,883
Like every night. We're on a deadline. Go.

00:00:41,023 --> 00:00:43,016
(Siren)

00:00:45,986 --> 00:00:47,778
Man versus gravity.

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:50,697
Man lost.

00:00:50,824 --> 00:00:53,066
I think that was his point.

00:00:53,202 --> 00:00:54,993
- Hello, Bob.
- Hey, Brian.

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,698
Grissom, what are you doing here?

00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,531
- What do you think?
- I didn't alert Homicide.

00:01:00,668 --> 00:01:02,993
Dispatch called. The body's on county property.

00:01:03,128 --> 00:01:05,370
Well, we're not looking at a crime here.

00:01:05,506 --> 00:01:07,913
Bob explained it to me on the phone.

00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,089
His guy was alone up there

00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:12,544
He jumped. This is suicide.

00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,253
- Then why are you here, Sheriff?
- Look er...

00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:17,763
Roger Valenti was an unhappy guy.

00:01:17,893 --> 00:01:19,886
Money problems, family problems...

00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,562
He took the easy way out.

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,223
It's a tragedy, but it is not a crime.

00:01:26,443 --> 00:01:28,021
Suicide, huh?

00:01:28,153 --> 00:01:29,731
I don't know Brian

00:01:29,863 --> 00:01:32,651
On the day you decide to end your life,

00:01:32,783 --> 00:01:34,692
why would you go to work?

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,986
1,400 new beds means 1,400 criminals
off the street. That old jail's maxed.

00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:20,203
The prison population's increased by 10%
in one year.

00:02:20,331 --> 00:02:22,703
If this place isn't built soon, you do the math.

00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:27,042
You look like the Sheriff,
but you talk like the Mayor.

00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:30,125
Mr Harris, do you get an extra bonus
for early completion?

00:02:30,257 --> 00:02:32,333
20 grand a day. I'm 10 days ahead.

00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:36,133
Wow. $200,000.
You must work your guys pretty hard, huh?

00:02:46,482 --> 00:02:50,562
- Where was Valenti's work station?
- He had the whole floor to himself.

00:02:50,694 --> 00:02:52,651
Valenti was usually my first guy up.

00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,187
He would drill the holes for the safety cables.

00:02:56,408 --> 00:03:00,358
No-one walks a new slab until
the cables are looped around the perimeter.

00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:02,120
(Car horns and sirens)

00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:11,545
Terminal velocity
is 9.8 metres per second squared.

00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:14,959
He would have hit the ground
in under five seconds.

00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:59,006
- Did this belong to Mr Valenti?
- Well, like I said, he was the only one up here.

00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:05,227
This drill has shorted out.

00:04:05,352 --> 00:04:09,053
Do you think he jumped before or after
he got the shock of his life?

00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:11,182
GFCI would have prevented shock.

00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:12,515
What is GFCI?

00:04:12,651 --> 00:04:14,691
The Ground-Fault Circuit Interrupter.

00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,607
Big words meaning he won't get electrocuted.

00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:21,529
You see, if there's an electrical imbalance,

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,528
then the GFCI trips the circuit
and the tool's supposed to shut itself off.

00:04:29,627 --> 00:04:34,419
But if the third prong of the plug is compromised,
the interrupter won't work.

00:04:34,548 --> 00:04:35,711
Will it, Bob?

00:04:35,841 --> 00:04:37,584
The third prong grounds the drill.

00:04:37,718 --> 00:04:39,711
Without it, the interrupter's useless.

00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:43,344
These prongs don't usually snap off
by themselves.

00:05:00,991 --> 00:05:04,360
Are all your workers
this careless with their tools?

00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:10,501
Do you mind telling me what you're doing?

00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:14,333
These cutters may have been used
to tamper with the grounding prong.

00:05:14,463 --> 00:05:16,954
What happened to good old dusting for prints?

00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:19,379
When your crime scene is 12 storeys up...

00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,962
...I don't wanna take any chances.

00:05:25,432 --> 00:05:27,010
I'm gonna lock in these prints.

00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:41,813
Hey, O'Riley. We got the 419.

00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,820
Dylan Buckley. 14 years old.

00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,166
The paramedics pronounced

00:05:52,293 --> 00:05:53,953
The coroner's on his way

00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,963
Was he home alone?

00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:01,167
Not alone. Not his home.

00:06:04,763 --> 00:06:07,468
Catherine Willows, Nick Stokes. Crime Lab.

00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,763
Dr Leigh Sapien.

00:06:09,893 --> 00:06:11,174
This is her residence

00:06:11,312 --> 00:06:12,936
On good

00:06:13,063 --> 00:06:14,095
Then you can fill us in.

00:06:14,231 --> 00:06:16,900
- We were in the middle of a session.
- You're a therapist?

00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:20,893
- Psychiatrist.
- And why were you seeing Dylan?

00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,440
Doctor-patient privilege.

00:06:22,573 --> 00:06:24,696
Privilege doesn't extend post mortem.

00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:26,568
We can get a warrant for your records.

00:06:26,702 --> 00:06:30,201
No need. Dylan suffered from
reactive-attachment disorder.

00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:33,746
Issues with his mother.
I'd been treating him for 16 months.

00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:35,370
It's ten o'clock at night.

00:06:35,502 --> 00:06:36,961
Is this your home?

00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:38,914
I see my patients whenever they need me.

00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:41,835
On weekends, at night, at the office or here.

00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:44,126
Why don't you... just tell us what happened?

00:06:44,261 --> 00:06:47,511
Dylan had an argument with his mother.
He needed to unload.

00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,131
He was complaining about his curfew

00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:52,509
blaming his mother for problems at school

00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,637
Suddenly he began to convulse

00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:01,064
I tried to stabilise his head,
but it was a grand mal seizure.

00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,190
Dylan was an epileptic.

00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:07,067
He hit his head.

00:07:07,201 --> 00:07:09,692
And when the convulsions stopped,
he was dead.

00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:11,371
Did you try to revive him?

00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,240
Of course Standard CPR

00:07:13,374 --> 00:07:16,078
Cleared his airway, worked his chest.

00:07:19,296 --> 00:07:22,796
I... take it this wasn't his first convulsion?

00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:25,594
He was diagnosed with epilepsy at age three.

00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,802
W-What are you doing?

00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:31,469
Catherine, we need to get
a tape lift here, please.

00:07:37,856 --> 00:07:39,683
Look, I dialled 911.

00:07:40,818 --> 00:07:41,980
I'm not hiding anything.

00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:43,902
Well...

00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:45,938
I can see that.

00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:58,747
Quick. Name three human bones
that can withstand a 12-storey drop.

00:07:58,877 --> 00:08:02,460
The bones of the inner ear -
malleus, incus, stapes.

00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:06,255
High cellular density,
completely protected by the skull. Why?

00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:09,635
They appear to be the only bones
not fractured or broken.

00:08:09,763 --> 00:08:11,886
I wanna see the entry and exit wounds.

00:08:12,016 --> 00:08:15,550
He wasn't shot. This guy fell off
the new jailhouse. Are we on the same case?

00:08:15,686 --> 00:08:19,386
- He fell after he was electrocuted.
- News to me.

00:08:19,523 --> 00:08:22,228
I didn't find any physical evidence
of electrocution.

00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:24,019
Faulty drill.

00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:26,359
There should be burn marks
on one of his palms.

00:08:29,366 --> 00:08:31,193
Negative on the burn marks

00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:34,742
In most electrocution cases, capillaries rupture,

00:08:34,872 --> 00:08:37,992
haemoglobin leaks into the perivascular tissue.

00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:41,576
Right. Creating a fern-like pattern on the chest.

00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,751
His body contradicts your crime scene.

00:08:49,887 --> 00:08:52,674
I don't care what his body says.
This guy was electrocuted.

00:08:52,806 --> 00:08:54,051
It was not an accident.

00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:08,895
What?

00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:10,655
I don't know what I'm looking for.

00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,902
Signs of charring or melting.
You've done this before.

00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:15,827
Yean but

00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,532
we always go back to the body.

00:09:17,665 --> 00:09:19,207
The body tells the story.

00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:23,200
And, in this case, the body says
there was no crime and you're not listening.

00:09:24,338 --> 00:09:25,287
Why?

00:09:25,422 --> 00:09:27,415
Now and then we have to break the rules.

00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:30,254
Start with the conclusion
and work our way backwards.

00:09:30,386 --> 00:09:32,924
Like when we don't agree with
the coroner's report?

00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:34,430
Like, for instance,

00:09:34,556 --> 00:09:37,842
in the 1800s...
when surgery was Russian roulette

00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,886
and patients were dying on the tables.

00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,594
- Germs?
- Until Louis Pasteur theorised

00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:45,768
that something we could not see
was attacking the patients.

00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:48,060
- Relevance?
- Bodies tell us stories

00:09:48,195 --> 00:09:51,231
because we interpret them
how our predecessors taught us to.

00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:54,236
Not seeing something
doesn't mean that it's not there.

00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:08,631
Wires are crossed.

00:10:10,426 --> 00:10:12,050
Polarity's been reversed.

00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:18,382
This confirms that
someone tampered with Valenti's drill.

00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:25,770
The rubber soles of his boots
should have protected him from electrical shock.

00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:30,941
That's why you're safe in a car during a lightning
storm - you're insulated by the rubber tyres.

00:10:34,783 --> 00:10:38,318
Rubber's an insulator, but metal's a conductor.

00:10:38,454 --> 00:10:40,411
What form of metal hides in plain view

00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,081
at a construction site?

00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:49,335
A nail

00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,005
Hey

00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:02,177
How's that palm print
Grissom got off those cutters?

00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:04,802
Good. I'm running it through AFIS right now.

00:11:04,938 --> 00:11:06,896
Good thing is, the jailhouse is a union gig,

00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:09,479
and all the union guys
are already in the database.

00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,484
What I did for the print was I lined up

00:11:11,612 --> 00:11:16,274
the ridge detail from the partial
that I found on each handle.

00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:17,986
Nice.

00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:20,863
(Sighs) So...

00:11:20,996 --> 00:11:22,989
you think that guy fried before he fell?

00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:25,496
I don't know. We found a nail in his boot.

00:11:25,626 --> 00:11:27,951
It could have pierced the protective rubber.

00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,669
It might have allowed electricity
to course through his body.

00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,875
Bobby Dawson's taking odds.

00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:36,002
2 to 1, Grissom's wrong.

00:11:36,136 --> 00:11:39,801
5 to 1, he gets suspended
for shutting down that jailhouse.

00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,258
- 10 to 1...
- Fired.

00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,016
(Beeping)

00:11:48,482 --> 00:11:50,273
Sounds like you got a match

00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,985
Hey Gris

00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,773
How long have you been there?

00:11:55,906 --> 00:11:57,021
Yeah. Yeah, we do.

00:11:58,075 --> 00:12:00,281
The um... It's a former union guy,

00:12:00,411 --> 00:12:03,447
turned night-shift project manager.

00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,861
Robert Harris.

00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:06,409
Does that name mean anything?

00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:07,621
Yeah.

00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:09,376
Especially if you bet against me.

00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:21,799
My prints are on the cutters because they're on
everything at the site. I'm the project manager.

00:12:21,932 --> 00:12:23,426
There's no mystery here.

00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:26,643
You are, but you don't actually use
all the tools, right?

00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,562
I'm vigilant about safety.

00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:31,606
I'm always inspecting the equipment, tools...

00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:34,141
Look, this is what's going to happen here.

00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:38,489
The construction site is going to reopen
and the investigation goes away.

00:12:38,616 --> 00:12:41,533
Sure. After the lab processes all the evidence.

00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,239
Excuse me.

00:12:47,124 --> 00:12:49,911
For the record,
I don't like being put in the middle.

00:12:50,044 --> 00:12:51,242
Who does?

00:12:51,378 --> 00:12:55,079
I did a little homework on the guy
who took a nose dive after he was electrocuted.

00:12:55,215 --> 00:12:57,208
Three days ago he was voted union rep.

00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:00,094
Demanded more overtime pay.
Pressed for a walkout.

00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,890
- Motive?
- Right.

00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,640
Oh, in case you're interested,

00:13:05,768 --> 00:13:08,175
Bob Harris was the Sheriff's best man.

00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:18,234
- What was that about?
- Oh... We're in a bowling league together.

00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,570
- Can we wrap this up?
- Sure.

00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,155
Someone tampered with Roger Valenti's drill.

00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:25,697
And I have only one suspect.

00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:27,822
I read the coroner's prelim.

00:13:27,957 --> 00:13:30,792
There is nothing in it about electrocution.

00:13:30,918 --> 00:13:32,246
That's why it's a "prelim".

00:13:33,462 --> 00:13:36,167
Mr Harris, were you against
Valenti's union activities?

00:13:36,298 --> 00:13:39,085
Of course not. I'm a union man myself.

00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,507
You're fishing, Gil. We're done here.

00:13:41,637 --> 00:13:43,012
Moving on.

00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,316
Mrs Buckley, do you have someone
to drive you home?

00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:42,320
- Mrs Buckley?
- Yes?

00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,773
Do you have someone to drive you home?

00:14:44,908 --> 00:14:47,578
Oh, er... Thank you, I'll be all right.

00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:54,574
- Mrs Buckley?
- Yeah.

00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,996
I'm Nick Stokes, Crime Lab.
I've been assigned your son's case.

00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,131
- Crime Lab?
- It's... protocol.

00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,252
We were... just having pizza together.

00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:06,846
He seemed fine and...

00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,724
I dropped him off at Dr Sapien's and...

00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:17,763
My husband passed away three years ago
and now my...

00:15:29,453 --> 00:15:31,280
...my baby's gone.

00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,791
I understand.

00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,171
If you'll excuse me,
I need to go and make arrangements.

00:15:39,254 --> 00:15:40,286
Sure.

00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:44,959
I'm sorry for your loss.

00:15:46,804 --> 00:15:48,381
Thank you.

00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:03,811
My youngest just turned 14.

00:16:03,946 --> 00:16:05,654
Tough age.

00:16:08,284 --> 00:16:09,991
Cause of death?

00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:14,068
Cranial cerebral injuries.
Comminuted fractures of the occipital bone.

00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,917
Injuries consistent with a grand mal seizure?

00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,005
First blush, yes.

00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:27,340
Waiting on toxicology. In the meantime,

00:16:27,469 --> 00:16:29,343
check out his torso.

00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:31,879
He's covered in bruises

00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:34,554
Possibly from being thrashed
during the seizure?

00:16:34,685 --> 00:16:35,716
Possibly.

00:16:37,187 --> 00:16:39,394
I found tan fibres on his boxers.

00:16:39,523 --> 00:16:42,228
You, too, huh? His body's covered in them.

00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:46,689
Fibres on his body, his underwear,
but not on his shirt and pants. Why?

00:16:46,822 --> 00:16:50,072
Maybe it's as simple as
he wasn't wearing his shirt and pants.

00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,404
Then, at some point, he was with his shrink...
in his underwear.

00:16:53,537 --> 00:16:56,075
Exactly what kind of therapy was this?

00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,483
- Gil Grissom?
- Yes.

00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:30,028
I have information... about Roger Valenti.

00:17:30,157 --> 00:17:31,900
Call Jim Brass at Homicide.

00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:38,451
I was the union rep before Roger.
The walkout was my idea.

00:17:38,582 --> 00:17:40,076
Bob Harris...

00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:42,201
threatened me and my family.

00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:47,085
I wouldn't betray the union,
so I gave up my position at the local.

00:17:47,216 --> 00:17:49,422
Roger... picked up where I left off.

00:17:49,551 --> 00:17:50,927
Why are you telling me this?

00:17:51,053 --> 00:17:52,547
Because it could have been me.

00:17:54,723 --> 00:17:56,515
Cheese...

00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,184
milk...

00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,342
...sweaters.

00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,231
What do these things have in common?

00:18:03,357 --> 00:18:05,729
Goat cheese. Goat milk.

00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:08,232
- Goat... sweaters?
- Angora.

00:18:08,362 --> 00:18:11,612
Ding, ding, ding!
Fibres from the lady shrink, fibres from the boy.

00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,484
Both are angora

00:18:13,617 --> 00:18:15,325
Angora is processed goat hair?

00:18:15,452 --> 00:18:16,650
Mm-hm.

00:18:16,787 --> 00:18:20,073
Sheared, washed, spun and dyed.
Angora is 100% goat.

00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,619
You didn't know that, Nick?

00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,663
- Must be a chick thing.
- (Laughs)

00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:29,709
(Yawns)

00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,503
I need to see the body again.

00:18:32,636 --> 00:18:35,554
- No can do. Released six hours ago.
- Final report?

00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:39,761
Another 24, but there's nothing
to support Valenti was electrocuted.

00:18:39,893 --> 00:18:43,227
- Doc, please.
- You want to look at my notes.

00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,982
So, what have you got?

00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,518
I mean, anything unusual, even the mundane.

00:18:50,654 --> 00:18:54,106
His troponin enzymes are elevated.

00:18:54,241 --> 00:18:57,112
They become elevated
after ventricular fibrillation,

00:18:57,244 --> 00:18:59,153
which could be caused by electrocution.

00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:02,408
Sure, but troponin is found
in all victims of cardiac arrest.

00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,534
Most of whom have not been zapped.

00:19:04,668 --> 00:19:05,747
Work with me, will you?

00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:09,626
Er... Vic also had an elevated concentration
of iron in his blood.

00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:11,334
Six, seven times normal.

00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:13,340
- Life-threatening?
- No.

00:19:13,469 --> 00:19:14,749
What else?

00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:18,172
Well, it fits the bill of "mundane".
His skin looked jaundiced.

00:19:18,307 --> 00:19:20,264
Postmortem deoxygenation?

00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:23,678
Dead or alive, your vic's epidermis is yellow.

00:19:26,815 --> 00:19:28,855
- Tell me about his testicles.
- What?

00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,061
OK, I'm working with you. Er...

00:19:34,198 --> 00:19:35,906
I... I don't remember.

00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:39,153
I mean... genetics can be fascinating

00:19:39,286 --> 00:19:41,078
and there are things I take note of.

00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:43,914
But I didn't focus on his genitals.

00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:47,535
Thanks, doc.

00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,748
You're welcome.

00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:53,372
<i>Let's cool off with a blast from the past</i>

00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:57,173
<i>Here's Chubby Checker and Limbo Rock</i>

00:19:57,304 --> 00:19:58,585
What are you guys doing?

00:19:58,722 --> 00:20:00,881
Waiting for an assignment.

00:20:01,016 --> 00:20:03,305
- You got a new case for us?
- A new case?

00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:06,436
We heard the Sheriff put the brakes
on the investigation.

00:20:06,563 --> 00:20:07,726
I didn't say that, did I?

00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:13,440
Well, I think I er...
smell something burning in the DNA Lab.

00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:16,655
- Love to stay and chat, but...
- Greg?

00:20:18,534 --> 00:20:20,610
I hope that's not the crossword puzzle.

00:20:20,744 --> 00:20:24,196
<i>Hey let's do the limbo rock!
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ha!</i>

00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:26,787
<i>Don't move that limbo bar!</i>

00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:30,084
<i>You'll be a limbo star</i>

00:20:30,212 --> 00:20:32,454
<i>How low can you go?</i>

00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:35,081
What about the nail
we pulled out of Valenti's boot?

00:20:35,217 --> 00:20:37,008
- Dusted?
- No, cos...

00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:39,591
Process the nail, please. If you get a print...

00:20:39,722 --> 00:20:42,177
I'll compare it to Bob Harris's ten card.

00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:44,015
Anything else?

00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:45,720
Yes. Metal cutters.

00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:49,767
I need you to prove or disprove whether
they were used to sever the grounding prong.

00:20:49,898 --> 00:20:50,978
OK.

00:20:53,193 --> 00:20:54,142
And you're with me.

00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,832
(Music builds)

00:21:28,604 --> 00:21:29,683
Mr Gesek!

00:21:32,608 --> 00:21:33,983
You're conducting.

00:21:36,153 --> 00:21:39,024
- I didn't hear you come in.
- Vivaldi. Four Seasons.

00:21:39,156 --> 00:21:41,196
Vivaldi, Valenti.

00:21:42,326 --> 00:21:44,864
Both Italians. It's like... being in Venice.

00:21:47,665 --> 00:21:50,037
Why are you here? Do I need a lawyer?

00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:51,994
Have you prepped him yet?

00:21:52,127 --> 00:21:54,915
I was about to commence draining
when I got distracted.

00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,503
Yeah, I know - Venice.
I need to see his testicles.

00:21:57,633 --> 00:21:59,672
I knew there was something weird about you.

00:21:59,802 --> 00:22:01,212
Excuse me!

00:22:01,345 --> 00:22:04,097
You can't just come in here
and look at my guy's goods.

00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:07,177
If I let you see him,
I have to let everybody see him.

00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:13,056
- But... perhaps we can work something out.
- What? Do you want us to pay to see him?

00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,396
That's a good idea, but no.

00:22:15,526 --> 00:22:19,025
I'm starting a business:
Crime Scene Cleanup. I'll want some referrals.

00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:22,231
I'll put you on a list.

00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:27,704
Testicular atrophy.

00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,288
They're the size of peas.

00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:30,992
Poor guy.

00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:34,375
Yeah, that's rough.
And the significance of this evidence?

00:22:34,503 --> 00:22:36,792
Haemochromatosis.

00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:39,923
Valenti had elevated levels of iron in his blood.

00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,292
Yellow pallor. Shrunken testicles.

00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:45,797
He's been ingesting trace amounts of iron
over a long period of time.

00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,390
Why'd he eat iron?

00:22:47,516 --> 00:22:50,885
Trace amounts are odourless, tasteless.
He probably didn't know.

00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,893
- You're saying he was poisoned?
- No.

00:22:53,022 --> 00:22:55,595
Iron molecules take a long time to build up.

00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:59,813
Could have been his diet, repeated blood
transfusions, excessive smoking.

00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,737
Possibly hereditary abnormalities.

00:23:01,864 --> 00:23:03,275
So, where does this get us?

00:23:03,407 --> 00:23:05,613
One step closer. Mr Gesek...

00:23:05,743 --> 00:23:08,613
Stick a syringe in his carotid,
all the way to his clavicle.

00:23:08,746 --> 00:23:10,454
You want his blood?

00:23:10,581 --> 00:23:12,289
One pint. To go.

00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:19,788
- Warrick.
- Hey.

00:23:19,923 --> 00:23:22,000
- I got a thumbprint off that nail.
- Cool.

00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,625
Only a partial. Print Lab's running a comparison.

00:23:24,762 --> 00:23:27,050
Whatever happened with those metal cutters?

00:23:27,181 --> 00:23:30,799
Serrations didn't match up.
They weren't used on the grounding prong.

00:23:30,934 --> 00:23:33,888
- What's in the envelope?
- Roger Valenti's blood.

00:23:34,021 --> 00:23:36,393
Grissom wants it packaged in plastic.

00:23:36,523 --> 00:23:37,721
I don't know. Don't ask.

00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:40,484
You want lunch?

00:23:40,611 --> 00:23:42,188
Later.

00:23:45,032 --> 00:23:46,312
- Hey, Catherine?
- Yeah.

00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:47,695
You ever been in therapy?

00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:49,534
Who hasn't?

00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:51,322
Didn't save my marriage.

00:23:51,455 --> 00:23:54,575
You were OK sharing your problems
with a complete stranger?

00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:56,167
You rather I tell them to you?

00:23:57,294 --> 00:23:58,753
Somebody order a warrant?

00:23:58,879 --> 00:24:01,584
- Yeah.
- Mustard and relish. Hold the onions.

00:24:01,715 --> 00:24:02,830
I hope it's a general.

00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:05,967
Epilepsy. Eyewitness physician dials 911.

00:24:06,095 --> 00:24:08,586
Coroner's quiet. You're lucky to get a limited.

00:24:08,722 --> 00:24:12,850
What do you mean? We've got fibres
on a 14-year-old and the shrink's clothing.

00:24:12,977 --> 00:24:14,601
Which would have got you nothing.

00:24:14,728 --> 00:24:18,144
But I did a check on the doctor.
She once had her licence suspended.

00:24:18,273 --> 00:24:23,019
Sex with a patient.
Teen's parents filed a complaint with the APA.

00:24:23,153 --> 00:24:27,281
Sex with a minor? Suspension's a joke.
She should have lost her licence, minimum.

00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:29,199
Yeah, well, this time maybe she will.

00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:54,511
OK, Gris.

00:24:56,687 --> 00:24:58,098
Valenti's blood.

00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,605
Packaged. Ready to go.

00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:01,012
Thank you.

00:25:04,945 --> 00:25:06,737
You wanna fill me in here? I mean...

00:25:06,864 --> 00:25:09,569
This wasn't covered in any science class I took.

00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,942
Well, iron is a conductive mineral.

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,993
I wanna know if there was enough iron
in Valenti's blood... to conduct electricity.

00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:21,699
- That's far out
- Yeah, well...

00:25:21,837 --> 00:25:23,415
We'll see.

00:25:23,547 --> 00:25:25,338
Plug in the blood.

00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,567
Angora fibres?
What does that have to do with anything?

00:25:50,991 --> 00:25:54,158
Excuse me, I don't appreciate
being treated like a suspect.

00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,243
Then maybe you should wait outside.

00:25:56,372 --> 00:25:59,788
Do you consider me a suspect?
Because that's how I'm feeling.

00:26:03,545 --> 00:26:04,744
Fine

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,956
Don't answer me. It's your choice.

00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:09,000
Funny thing about choices.

00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:11,886
Once you make 'em, you have to live with 'em.

00:26:14,056 --> 00:26:16,049
Dylan Buckley was just a boy.

00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:20,388
He trusted you.

00:26:20,521 --> 00:26:22,928
And you abused that trust.

00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,892
Linen closet. Top shelf.

00:26:27,027 --> 00:26:28,936
Was that blanket here?

00:26:29,071 --> 00:26:31,111
On the floor, with you and Dylan under it?

00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:43,951
It's gonna be OK.

00:26:44,086 --> 00:26:46,577
That's it. That's it.

00:26:46,714 --> 00:26:48,706
That's it. That's it.

00:26:50,426 --> 00:26:52,833
He was a 14-year-old kid

00:26:54,221 --> 00:26:55,715
What's the matter with you?

00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:59,181
He resisted. You persisted. Then what?

00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:03,259
I don't know the basis of your allegations,
but I have never crossed the line.

00:27:03,397 --> 00:27:05,140
That's not what your rap sheet says.

00:27:05,274 --> 00:27:06,554
Rap sheet?

00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:08,519
Sex with an underage patient.

00:27:08,652 --> 00:27:12,104
I was a resident. He was 17. We were in...

00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:16,652
Look, no criminal charges were filed.
It should have been expunged from my record.

00:27:16,785 --> 00:27:18,577
It doesn't make you any less guilty.

00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:20,282
Lady, I'm not a saint,

00:27:20,414 --> 00:27:23,534
but I am not a killer or a child molester.

00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,868
Dylan Buckley was an epileptic.

00:27:27,004 --> 00:27:29,412
He had a seizure. He hit his head.

00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:31,541
That's the truth.

00:27:31,675 --> 00:27:33,751
You don't like it? You can leave.

00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:37,715
We got what we came here for.

00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:44,385
- What's going on with you?
- I'm on a case.

00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:46,313
We're on a case.

00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,018
Right.

00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:06,620
Hey, is that from the deli?

00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:08,543
Egg salad sandwich. You want half?

00:28:08,671 --> 00:28:10,829
- No. Can I have your pickle?
- Yeah.

00:28:13,717 --> 00:28:15,425
You can have it.

00:28:16,637 --> 00:28:18,428
Oh, that's a nice one.

00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:39,025
You've turned my pickle into a light bulb.

00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:41,485
- I'm electrocuting it.
- You sure are.

00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,114
That would explain that smell.

00:28:43,247 --> 00:28:45,156
This is how I cooked hot dogs in college.

00:28:51,714 --> 00:28:53,706
Check out the burn marks.

00:28:54,925 --> 00:28:56,503
There are none.

00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:59,969
Just like Valenti's body.
No evidence of electrocution.

00:29:00,097 --> 00:29:02,968
Pickles are high in sodium content.

00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,342
Sodium is conductive, just like iron.

00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:08,644
The flow of electricity through a body
generates heat.

00:29:16,363 --> 00:29:19,898
Burn marks are the physical evidence
of that. But...

00:29:20,034 --> 00:29:23,782
if the body offers no resistance
to the flow of electricity -

00:29:23,912 --> 00:29:25,905
no heat, no burn marks.

00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,666
Roger Valenti's body offered up no resistance
because of the excess iron in his blood.

00:29:30,794 --> 00:29:32,372
It conducted electricity

00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:36,288
Making his body one big wire. Path to ground.

00:29:36,425 --> 00:29:40,043
In through his hand from the drill,
out through the nail in the boot.

00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:43,299
No burn marks... but he was still electrocuted.

00:30:01,659 --> 00:30:03,402
So you've just proved murder.

00:30:04,787 --> 00:30:07,278
I wouldn't break out that champagne just yet.

00:30:07,414 --> 00:30:10,914
Don't go shooting the messenger.
Thumbprint from the nail.

00:30:13,963 --> 00:30:16,798
Bob Harris's prints were not
on the murder weapon?

00:30:16,924 --> 00:30:18,252
They were not on the nail.

00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:22,677
I think someone stuck a nail in the victim's boot
and it wasn't Bob Harris.

00:30:22,805 --> 00:30:25,130
So you made a suspect out of an innocent man.

00:30:25,265 --> 00:30:27,139
Obviously that wasn't my intent.

00:30:27,267 --> 00:30:31,016
Oh, good. Maybe you'll wanna bring that up
in the newspaper article.

00:30:31,146 --> 00:30:33,637
What are you talking about? What article?

00:30:33,774 --> 00:30:36,894
The one I'm arranging for your public apology.

00:30:37,027 --> 00:30:39,565
- I'm not making an apology.
- Oh, yes, you are.

00:30:39,697 --> 00:30:45,237
You don't go after a friend of mine,
sully his reputation and then walk away.

00:30:45,369 --> 00:30:47,825
Actions have consequences, Gil. Even yours.

00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:08,423
I heard the Sheriff chewed you a new one.

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,762
- You get my message?
- You want me to check out your Deep Throat.

00:31:11,895 --> 00:31:13,176
(Printer beeps)

00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:16,391
Well, that was fast.

00:31:16,525 --> 00:31:19,526
Ian Wolf. Union of Electrical Workers, Local 37.

00:31:19,653 --> 00:31:24,399
He wanted to make sure that I stayed on Harris
for the murder of Roger Valenti.

00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:27,867
- Doesn't that tell you something?
- I told him to talk to you.

00:31:27,995 --> 00:31:29,786
I'll check out the guy.

00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:32,117
(Sighs)

00:31:32,249 --> 00:31:34,242
Gil, why do you do this to yourself?

00:31:34,376 --> 00:31:36,203
- What?
- The guy's dead

00:31:36,337 --> 00:31:38,828
Could have been suicide. Accident.

00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:40,624
You always gotta push it.

00:31:40,758 --> 00:31:42,631
It's just like any other case.

00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,218
You know what I think?

00:31:44,345 --> 00:31:45,590
Adrenaline.

00:31:45,721 --> 00:31:48,177
You need the rush

00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:50,549
But that's just me.

00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:49,233
OK. Thank you, David.

00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:50,827
No sweat.

00:32:50,953 --> 00:32:53,870
Hey, he asked for it.

00:32:53,998 --> 00:32:57,117
How many swabs does it take
to process a blanket?

00:32:57,251 --> 00:32:58,247
I'm thorough.

00:32:58,377 --> 00:33:01,544
The lab tested Dylan Buckley's blood
for creatine kinase

00:33:01,672 --> 00:33:03,665
which would be elevated post-seizure.

00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:05,875
But Dylan Buckley's levels were normal.

00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,086
I just got my own copy of the report.

00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:10,466
Dr Sapien lied.

00:33:11,598 --> 00:33:14,718
You're racing me, Nick.
We're driving the same car.

00:33:14,852 --> 00:33:16,761
Nick!

00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:20,648
Nick, I'll have you removed from the case.

00:33:25,738 --> 00:33:29,237
You're confronting suspects
before the evidence is processed.

00:33:29,366 --> 00:33:31,359
You're flying solo, cutting me out.

00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:34,192
What's going on?

00:33:35,998 --> 00:33:37,576
OK.

00:33:39,335 --> 00:33:43,083
There are some people
you're supposed to be able to trust, you know.

00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:50,215
I was nine
and she was a last-minute baby-sitter.

00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:57,476
All I can remember doing afterwards
is sitting in my room in the dark,

00:33:57,603 --> 00:34:01,102
staring at the door,
waiting for my... mom to get home.

00:34:05,861 --> 00:34:07,854
I've never told anyone before.

00:34:14,495 --> 00:34:16,072
I'm sorry.

00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:19,198
It's what makes a person, I guess.

00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:23,912
I'm sorry, Catherine.

00:34:29,259 --> 00:34:33,471
Check me out. So what? The worst thing
I've done is get a speeding ticket.

00:34:33,597 --> 00:34:36,468
And take a pipe to Valenti's head
four days before he died.

00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,218
It wasn't on the foreman's report.
Valenti's widow told me.

00:34:40,354 --> 00:34:42,145
Guys get in beefs all the time

00:34:42,272 --> 00:34:44,942
But he died
Harris had nothing to do with it

00:34:45,067 --> 00:34:47,523
Despite your efforts to make it seem that way.

00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:51,401
Look, I'm not saying another word
till I talk to a union lawyer.

00:34:51,532 --> 00:34:54,367
I pay my dues and these guys play hardball.

00:35:02,209 --> 00:35:03,324
He's guilty.

00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,951
Let's not make the same mistake twice.

00:35:07,214 --> 00:35:11,128
30 swabs in six hours?
Not realistic, all right? Even for me.

00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,629
I thought you'd like the challenge.
What are we looking at here?

00:35:14,763 --> 00:35:18,263
Lots of epithelials.
There were skin cells shed all over the blanket.

00:35:18,392 --> 00:35:20,385
Dylan Buckley's. Dr Sapien's.

00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:22,144
You're two-thirds of the way there.

00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:26,185
I also isolated a set of cells
from another individual. Identity unknown.

00:35:28,736 --> 00:35:31,405
But, when it's important to Nick here,
I push further.

00:35:31,488 --> 00:35:33,777
7 of the 13 markers match your dead kid.

00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:36,612
Familial DNA?

00:35:36,744 --> 00:35:38,653
Father's dead. Means we're looking at mom.

00:35:38,787 --> 00:35:42,737
A naked kid under a blanket at a shrink's
late at night... and his mother's there.

00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:45,876
Your case just entered
a whole new dimension of weird.

00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:58,057
- Where's Mandy?
- Cross-eyed from running our partial.

00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,678
I didn't wanna lose any time so I took over.

00:36:00,809 --> 00:36:03,098
The database is 70,000.

00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:05,470
- It could take a while
- If I narrow the scope?

00:36:05,606 --> 00:36:07,314
- To one.
- We got a suspect?

00:36:07,441 --> 00:36:10,857
Ian Wolf. Like the animal, not the authors.

00:36:22,206 --> 00:36:26,334
Partial overlay - perfect match.
Now we just gotta place him at the crime scene.

00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,125
Warrick's on it. I got a warrant for his tool belt.
Metal cutters included.

00:36:35,052 --> 00:36:36,843
(Door opens)

00:36:38,305 --> 00:36:42,255
Doc? The kid in his underwear -
tell us about the Y-incision.

00:36:42,393 --> 00:36:44,184
Leftovers from my anniversary dinner.

00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:45,889
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:49,639
The same tan fibres I found on the outside
I found on the inside.

00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:53,061
Mouth, nasal passages, both lungs.

00:36:53,195 --> 00:36:55,947
- He was wrapped in that blanket.
- Mm-hm. Head to toe.

00:37:02,288 --> 00:37:05,657
Mrs Buckley, we know that your son
didn't have a seizure.

00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:08,709
We also know that you were
at Dr Sapien's house with Dylan

00:37:08,836 --> 00:37:10,460
the night that he died

00:37:10,587 --> 00:37:13,672
He was in his underwear,
wrapped in a blanket,

00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:15,792
fighting for every breath.

00:37:15,926 --> 00:37:17,504
I loved my son.

00:37:18,721 --> 00:37:20,547
That's what every parent says.

00:37:21,765 --> 00:37:23,473
This...

00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,720
This was therapy. I had tried everything else.

00:37:26,854 --> 00:37:30,721
Taken him to so many specialists,
but I couldn't reach him.

00:37:30,858 --> 00:37:32,352
So we...

00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:33,943
We tried the...

00:37:34,069 --> 00:37:36,145
(Sighs) We

00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:42,449
I have to tell them.

00:37:45,748 --> 00:37:47,787
It's called rebirthing.

00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:50,418
Rebirthing?

00:37:50,544 --> 00:37:54,209
It's a technique used to treat
extreme behavioural disorders.

00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:57,459
The idea is to turn back the clock,
wipe the slate clean.

00:37:57,593 --> 00:37:59,799
Allow the child to re-bond with his mother.

00:37:59,928 --> 00:38:01,423
What is the blanket for?

00:38:01,555 --> 00:38:02,966
It represents the birth canal.

00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:07,636
So you wrapped Dylan up...

00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,519
beat the hell out of him and...

00:38:11,649 --> 00:38:14,899
hocus-pocus, he's supposed to love you again?

00:38:15,027 --> 00:38:20,187
Rebirthing may not be a recognised
therapeutic procedure, but it's not illegal.

00:38:20,324 --> 00:38:22,233
Last time I checked, murder is.

00:38:22,368 --> 00:38:24,076
I begged her to do it.

00:38:24,203 --> 00:38:26,112
All other methods of therapy had failed.

00:38:26,246 --> 00:38:29,450
Dylan was becoming more belligerent,
withdrawn. Even dangerous.

00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:33,118
I just wanted my son to love me. That's all.

00:38:33,253 --> 00:38:35,542
- Dylan was a willing participant.
- He was 14.

00:38:36,674 --> 00:38:40,089
I instructed Dylan to lie down
on the floor

00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:41,796
in the foetal position

00:38:41,929 --> 00:38:43,589
As part of the process,

00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:47,423
I asked him if he wanted to be reborn
to his mother. He said yes.

00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,885
Now we're going to close the womb.

00:38:52,356 --> 00:38:54,645
Twist.

00:38:54,775 --> 00:38:56,898
So, then what happened?

00:38:58,028 --> 00:39:00,068
Things got out of hand? He changed his mind?

00:39:00,197 --> 00:39:03,233
Somewhere in the middle
of an angora birth canal?

00:39:03,367 --> 00:39:05,075
It is time to be reborn.

00:39:06,328 --> 00:39:08,998
That's it. Push harder. Push harder!

00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:10,908
- Try to get out.
- (Fights for breath)

00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:13,497
A little harder. Come on, Dylan.

00:39:13,627 --> 00:39:15,620
I can't breathe. I'm gonna die!

00:39:15,754 --> 00:39:19,170
Do you wanna be reborn
or do you wanna stay in there and die?

00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,466
Let me outta here, please.
Mom, please! I want this to stop!

00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:25,631
- Maybe we should.
- No. This is what happens. We can't stop now.

00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:28,255
Trust me. This is a normal response.

00:39:29,476 --> 00:39:32,643
- I thought it was part of the process.
- It is.

00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:35,097
She said that that's what
he was supposed to say.

00:39:35,232 --> 00:39:39,811
That babies don't want to come out.
That's why it's such an ordeal for the woman.

00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,369
So, you pushed on him,
like a mother in labour?

00:39:47,453 --> 00:39:50,454
Come on! Push harder!

00:39:50,581 --> 00:39:52,241
Stop it! I can't breathe!

00:39:53,292 --> 00:39:54,952
Push harder!

00:39:55,085 --> 00:39:56,580
That's it!

00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:02,544
(Panting) OK.

00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,430
Honey?

00:40:08,557 --> 00:40:10,799
Dylan? Honey?

00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,183
When we opened the blanket,
his eyes were closed.

00:40:19,318 --> 00:40:21,357
I thought he was pretending to be asleep.

00:40:27,701 --> 00:40:30,192
So much for your... therapy.

00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:36,703
Excuse me.

00:40:44,677 --> 00:40:48,805
And that's why we tried to hide it.
We knew you wouldn't understand.

00:41:05,114 --> 00:41:07,237
The twin moons of Venus

00:41:07,366 --> 00:41:08,825
Overlap to one.

00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:13,244
The striations match

00:41:13,372 --> 00:41:15,495
Wolf stuck a nail in Valenti's boot

00:41:15,624 --> 00:41:19,207
compromised the drill, and cut
the grounding prong with his own cutters.

00:41:19,336 --> 00:41:22,539
- That seems like a lot of work to kill a guy.
- Not for an electrician.

00:41:22,673 --> 00:41:23,918
I'm gonna find Brass.

00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:25,212
Hey, Gris...

00:41:25,342 --> 00:41:28,842
I think I can speak for both of us
when I say I'm sorry that we let you down.

00:41:28,971 --> 00:41:32,719
- We quit before we should have.
- Yeah. You did.

00:41:37,813 --> 00:41:39,889
(Workmen shout)

00:41:45,404 --> 00:41:46,982
Mr Wolf!

00:41:48,157 --> 00:41:49,699
We got you for murder

00:41:49,825 --> 00:41:51,734
Premeditated.

00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:53,328
You know this from my cutters?

00:41:53,454 --> 00:41:55,411
They're just part of the story.

00:41:58,834 --> 00:42:02,962
You spiked Roger's boot with a nail
compromised the insulation

00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:05,923
You reversed the polarity in his drill.

00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,541
You cut the grounding prong

00:42:08,677 --> 00:42:10,337
planted evidence

00:42:10,471 --> 00:42:12,179
And killed a man.

00:42:26,111 --> 00:42:27,938
You're under arrest.

00:42:36,622 --> 00:42:38,413
Grissom!

00:42:40,918 --> 00:42:42,542
It's all you, man.

00:42:44,546 --> 00:42:46,206
Thank you.

00:42:47,424 --> 00:42:48,919
Sheriff.

00:42:49,051 --> 00:42:51,174
Well, you got the bad apple.

00:42:51,303 --> 00:42:52,797
Yeah. How about that?

00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:55,717
Just in time for my big public apology.

00:42:55,849 --> 00:42:58,519
I may be changing the tenor
of that piece somewhat.

00:42:58,644 --> 00:43:02,309
You won't be the goat,
but you won't be the hero, either.

00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:04,998
Good. I'll leave that to you.

00:43:05,126 --> 00:43:07,617
That's why we will continue
to work well together.

00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,493
Grissom.
