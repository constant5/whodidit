00:01:18,276 --> 00:01:20,278
Easy.

Have you been inside?

00:01:50,642 --> 00:01:52,277
What have you got?

00:02:02,087 --> 00:02:03,417
There you go,
Detective.

00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:05,119
Thanks.

00:02:05,186 --> 00:02:06,208
Little tired this morning.

00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,625
Pulling a double.

00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,090
Yeah, join the club.

00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:12,693
Good morning,
Catherine.

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,663
Good morning,
Gil.

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,367
So, this is
Tony Braun's house.

00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:21,402
Son of Sam Braun.

00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:24,672
GRISSOM:
He was Steve Wynn
before Steve Wynn.

00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:26,040
Oh, yeah,
you bet your ass.

00:02:26,107 --> 00:02:28,376
Sam came to Vegas
when Vegas was dying.

00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:31,212
Built three casinos
in a year.

00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:33,914
Had ties to
Bugsy Siegel.

00:02:36,717 --> 00:02:40,454
Wish I had Tony Braun's gardener
working for me.

00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:42,690
Guy sniffed it out
from the jump.

00:02:42,757 --> 00:02:44,058
Blinds were drawn shut.

00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,693
Side gate unlocked.

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,861
Dogs let out.

00:02:46,927 --> 00:02:48,829
"A" plus "B" plus "C"

00:02:48,896 --> 00:02:50,998
equals 9-1-1.

00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:04,412
All seems very neat
and peaceful, doesn't it?

00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,485
Chasing the dragon.

00:03:11,552 --> 00:03:12,620
A pinch of "H."

00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:13,688
Heat the foil.

00:03:13,754 --> 00:03:15,089
Inhale the fumes.

00:03:19,593 --> 00:03:23,064
With a Xanax back.

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,334
100 pills.

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,869
Prescription filled
yesterday.

00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:31,439
So the rumors
about ol' Tony boy are true.

00:03:31,505 --> 00:03:32,873
Drug overdose.

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,310
It sure seems that way.

00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:39,580

SIDLE:
Eight rolls.
Two copies.

00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:26,130
Case is hot.
Put a rush on it.

00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:42,076
Lose an earring?

Looks like <i>somebody</i> did.

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,856
He's got adhesive residue
on his wrists.

00:04:54,923 --> 00:04:55,924
He was restrained.

00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,559
Some sort of tape.

00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,693
Well, that would be the obvious.

00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,828
Braun had company.

00:04:59,894 --> 00:05:01,462
Welcome...

00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:03,498
or unwelcome?

00:05:03,565 --> 00:05:04,599
Where's the purge?

00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,135
Car blows its engine,
there's an oil leak.

00:05:07,202 --> 00:05:09,204
A guy ODs,
where's the body fluid?

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,705
Urine, vomit, excrement.

00:05:10,772 --> 00:05:12,273
Did somebody clean him up?

00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:20,048
SIDLE:
Interesting love bites
on the chest.

00:05:20,114 --> 00:05:21,883
Curious, isn't it?

00:05:24,686 --> 00:05:26,454
And he's posed.

00:05:27,822 --> 00:05:29,123
When did you know

00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,125
this was a homicide
and not an OD?

00:05:31,192 --> 00:05:31,926
Initially?

00:05:31,993 --> 00:05:32,727
Yeah.

00:05:32,794 --> 00:05:34,395
When I saw the TV on.

00:05:38,366 --> 00:05:39,501
( <i>barks</i> )

00:05:41,436 --> 00:05:43,004
Well, I'll tell
you one thing--

00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:44,205
if those were my dogs

00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:46,608
I wouldn't be leaving
this gate open.

00:05:46,674 --> 00:05:48,877
Yeah, you're talking
about a dog owner on heroin.

00:05:48,943 --> 00:05:50,144
How responsible can he be?

00:05:50,211 --> 00:05:52,647
Gardener said it was
the first time in five years

00:05:52,714 --> 00:05:54,449
that he'd found
this gate unlocked.

00:05:54,516 --> 00:05:56,651
What's so different
about this morning?

00:05:56,718 --> 00:05:58,553
Last morning of
Tony Braun's life?

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,722
Well, either somebody
inside the house

00:06:00,788 --> 00:06:04,292
opened it, or
somebody had a key

00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:06,861
because this lock
hasn't been forced.

00:06:06,928 --> 00:06:08,363
There's no pry marks.

00:06:08,429 --> 00:06:09,664
No metal shavings.

00:06:09,731 --> 00:06:11,833
So... why was
the gate open?

00:06:13,535 --> 00:06:15,937
BROWN:
A heroin addict's confetti.

00:06:16,004 --> 00:06:18,006
Nothing like going
on a binge.

00:06:28,116 --> 00:06:30,718
Some black tar heroin.

00:06:30,785 --> 00:06:34,088
This is the difference
between a Cadillac and a Pinto.

00:06:34,155 --> 00:06:35,089
How would you know?

00:06:35,156 --> 00:06:36,658
It's my job.

00:06:36,724 --> 00:06:39,594
I count at least
six balloons,
and that's

00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:40,862
just in the bedroom.

00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:43,531
The dealer must have come
down the chimney.

00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:45,667
It's like Christmas
in July here.

00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,005
Not that Braun
even needed any more drugs.

00:06:51,072 --> 00:06:53,474
Yeah, looks like the guy
had a pill for everything.

00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,443
Can you get a print
off those balloons?

00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,413
I can get a print
off the air.

00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,218
Any luck?

00:07:03,284 --> 00:07:06,087
I have gone through every
garbage can in the house.

00:07:06,154 --> 00:07:07,922
What about
the cans outside?

00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:09,691
First thing I
checked. Zip.

I always wondered
which one of us coroners

00:08:24,465 --> 00:08:25,767
would get to carve Tony.

00:08:29,771 --> 00:08:31,239
His lifestyle was no secret--

00:08:31,306 --> 00:08:32,373
sex, drugs

00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,142
and a big bankroll.

00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:36,711
No needle marks
on his arms.

00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:39,814
The guy plays golf;
short-sleeved shirts

00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:42,550
Checked between
the toes... groin area.

00:08:42,617 --> 00:08:45,420
Whatever he did
went up his nose.

00:08:45,486 --> 00:08:46,788
His nasal cavity

00:08:46,855 --> 00:08:48,656
looks like
raw hamburger.

00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:56,631
These abrasions around
his mouth? What?

00:08:56,698 --> 00:08:58,266
Hard to shave
when you're stoned?

00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,734
Or they're pressure marks.

00:08:59,801 --> 00:09:02,504
For example, if someone
places a pillow or object

00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,305
against someone's
nose and mouth

00:09:04,372 --> 00:09:05,940
in the climate of struggle.

00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:09,744
Petechial hemorrhaging?

00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:11,846
Also suggestive
of suffocation.

00:09:11,913 --> 00:09:13,848
Not always.

00:09:13,915 --> 00:09:17,752
For as much as pathology is
an absolute science, it isn't.

00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:21,089
Vessels can rupture
under innocent circumstances

00:09:21,155 --> 00:09:22,824
such as a violent cough.

00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:26,828
These three, circular,
red marks on his chest?

00:09:26,895 --> 00:09:28,129
They're not bug bites.

00:09:28,196 --> 00:09:29,764
No neurotoxins present

00:09:29,831 --> 00:09:33,268
but that's not to say
some overanxious paramedic

00:09:33,334 --> 00:09:37,672
trying to save a legend's life
didn't cause them in the moment.

00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:39,107
CPR wasn't performed.

00:09:39,174 --> 00:09:40,542
Then I don't know
what they are.

00:09:40,608 --> 00:09:43,511
It's hard to OD
just <i>inhaling</i> heroin.

00:09:43,578 --> 00:09:45,213
I know he was restrained

00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,583
which leads me to believe
that someone forced him

00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,719
to ingest lethal amounts
of heroin and Xanax.

00:09:51,786 --> 00:09:52,954
( <i>indistinct radio chatter</i> )

00:09:53,021 --> 00:09:54,289
Excuse me.

00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:59,861
Boy, are you lucky my lawyer's
on a golf course.

00:09:59,928 --> 00:10:02,664
I've been standing out here,
in the heat

00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,433
for hours, answering
these stupid questions.

00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,068
Here's your answer, okay.

00:10:07,135 --> 00:10:08,403
This is my house.

00:10:08,469 --> 00:10:09,737
Okay?

00:10:09,804 --> 00:10:12,207
This is half my house anyway.

00:10:12,273 --> 00:10:14,175
Who's this?

00:10:14,242 --> 00:10:15,743
BRASS:
It's Braun's squeeze.

00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,312
She's an ex-stripper, too.

00:10:17,378 --> 00:10:19,314
Perhaps you two met
in a professional capacity.

00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,315
These are my things...

00:10:20,381 --> 00:10:22,650
And, uh, where has she
been the past 12 hours?

00:10:22,717 --> 00:10:23,651
Uh, let's see.

00:10:23,718 --> 00:10:25,220
Oh, my God.

00:10:25,286 --> 00:10:29,357
"Out."

00:10:29,424 --> 00:10:31,426
When Tony's drug dealer
showed up, she split.

00:10:31,492 --> 00:10:32,827
She slept at a
friend's house.

00:10:32,894 --> 00:10:34,863
She didn't like
the way Tony acted

00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:37,198
when he was cruising
on magic carpets.

00:10:37,265 --> 00:10:40,168
Look, you two, listen--
if anything is missing
from this house

00:10:40,235 --> 00:10:42,270
I'm going to add you
to my lawyer's "to sue" list.

00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:44,105
Why don't you
just put the camera away

00:10:44,172 --> 00:10:45,406
before you get arrested?

00:10:45,473 --> 00:10:48,109
You can't arrest me
in my own house.

00:10:48,176 --> 00:10:50,812
Right now,
your house is our crime scene...

00:10:52,313 --> 00:10:54,349
and we can do whatever we want

00:10:54,415 --> 00:10:56,885
and that includes
fingerprinting you.

00:10:56,951 --> 00:10:58,052
Why?

00:10:58,119 --> 00:10:59,721
Didn't do anything.

00:10:59,787 --> 00:11:02,557
Thumb to pinkie.

00:11:02,624 --> 00:11:04,759
I just lost
my boyfriend, okay?

00:11:04,826 --> 00:11:06,094
You're a woman.

00:11:06,161 --> 00:11:09,531
I'm just looking out
for my end here, you know?

00:11:09,597 --> 00:11:11,466
Things start to disappear.

00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:14,502
If Tony were here right now,
he'd tell you himself

00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:16,938
"Just make sure
Janine's taken care of."

00:11:17,005 --> 00:11:18,473
That's a lawyer's call.

00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,974
Hey, I'm in the will.

00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,677
Of course you are.

00:11:30,185 --> 00:11:31,419
Can I help you?

00:11:31,486 --> 00:11:32,720
Yeah. Is Sam Braun in?

00:11:32,787 --> 00:11:34,455
He's not seeing anyone today.

00:11:34,522 --> 00:11:35,924
Would you let him know

00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,660
that Catherine Willows
is here to see him?

00:11:38,726 --> 00:11:40,695
( <i>keyboard clacking</i> )

00:11:43,865 --> 00:11:45,800
Just one second, please.

00:11:58,713 --> 00:11:59,848
Mugs?

00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:13,328
I remember
the first time I saw you.

00:12:13,394 --> 00:12:15,663
You didn't have
any clothes on.

00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,600
Yeah, well, that
was a long time ago.

00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:22,837
I would've taken you home
right then, if you had let me.

00:12:22,904 --> 00:12:24,839
I know, but you
were married.

00:12:24,906 --> 00:12:26,341
I was a baby.

00:12:26,407 --> 00:12:29,310
It would've never worked.

00:12:29,377 --> 00:12:32,380
Sam... how are
you holding up?

00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:34,716
Hey, Dad, I got the press
clogging up Valet.

00:12:34,782 --> 00:12:37,385
Should I call Security
or just handle it, or what?

00:12:37,452 --> 00:12:38,553
I'll take care of it.

00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,154
You go back to the pit.

00:12:40,221 --> 00:12:42,724
Make sure nobody's
robbing us blind.

00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:50,698
You know, back
in, uh... in '67

00:12:50,765 --> 00:12:53,635
I was in my 20s and...

00:12:53,701 --> 00:12:56,571
I was drinking in a dive
in downtown Buffalo.

00:12:56,638 --> 00:12:59,607
At the end of the bar
was this pro quarterback

00:12:59,674 --> 00:13:02,177
drinking double scotches,
two at a time

00:13:02,243 --> 00:13:04,245
midnight to 7:00
in the morning.

00:13:04,312 --> 00:13:07,215
It's Sunday,
game day, mind you.

00:13:07,282 --> 00:13:08,650
So you know
what I did?

00:13:08,716 --> 00:13:10,752
Called my bookie,
bet against him.

00:13:10,818 --> 00:13:13,388
Guess what?

00:13:13,454 --> 00:13:18,927
I'll be damned if he didn't
throw six touchdown passes.

00:13:18,993 --> 00:13:20,395
( <i>laughing</i> ):
Yeah...

00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:22,130
Sounds like Tony.

00:13:23,832 --> 00:13:26,668
You know,
even when Tony was juicing

00:13:26,734 --> 00:13:31,339
he could run circles around
these college, Harvard types.

00:13:31,406 --> 00:13:33,074
( <i>sniffling</i> )

00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:37,125
And I'm not saying that
just because he was my kid.

00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:43,885
Tony was the best damn casino
exec this town has ever seen

00:13:43,952 --> 00:13:47,088
and just between you and me...

00:13:47,155 --> 00:13:49,724
I couldn't hold a candle to him.

00:13:51,993 --> 00:13:53,995
Now he's dead.

00:13:55,997 --> 00:13:57,532
Overdose.

00:13:57,599 --> 00:14:01,102
Sam...

00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:03,404
The bigger the pedestal

00:14:03,471 --> 00:14:07,108
the bigger the target.

00:14:10,812 --> 00:14:16,618
Nobody shoots at that target
without going through me.

00:14:16,684 --> 00:14:19,187
Well, that's business.

00:14:19,254 --> 00:14:21,623
What about personal?

00:14:25,226 --> 00:14:26,327
What do you mean?

00:14:26,394 --> 00:14:27,996
Did you ever talk
to Tony

00:14:28,062 --> 00:14:29,998
about any
of his girlfriends?

00:14:30,064 --> 00:14:30,999
Which one?

00:14:31,065 --> 00:14:33,334
I mean, they were all trying
to pick the gold

00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:34,335
out of his teeth.

00:14:34,402 --> 00:14:35,470
Janine Haywood.

00:14:35,537 --> 00:14:36,971
She's the worst...

00:14:37,038 --> 00:14:39,174
and he loved her the most.

00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,775
Can you believe it?

00:14:40,842 --> 00:14:42,844
Yeah, I do.

00:14:47,682 --> 00:14:51,452
If I know her type,
now that she has the gold

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,355
she'll be going
after the silver.

00:15:29,224 --> 00:15:31,226
( <i>footsteps passing</i> )

00:16:03,658 --> 00:16:07,262
Okay, on the left,
Braun prints we got
from the Coroner

00:16:07,328 --> 00:16:09,164
and on the right,
gold digger prints

00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,632
I got
from Janine Haywood.

00:16:10,698 --> 00:16:12,500
Here's where it
gets interesting.

00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:14,435
I took six prints
off this bottle.

00:16:14,502 --> 00:16:16,404
And?
They all belong
to one person.

00:16:16,471 --> 00:16:19,607
Good thing or...
bad thing?

00:16:19,674 --> 00:16:21,042
It's good if you're us...

00:16:21,109 --> 00:16:23,077
( <i>keyboard clacking</i> )

00:16:23,144 --> 00:16:25,880
bad if you're
Janine Haywood.

00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:32,252
Have you seen Brass?

00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:34,121
Not tonight, no. Why?

00:16:34,187 --> 00:16:35,856
Oh, print off air.

00:16:35,922 --> 00:16:37,290
Orange balloon.

00:16:37,357 --> 00:16:38,658
Cyanoacrylate.

00:16:38,725 --> 00:16:40,961
Dead bang, drug dealer.

00:16:41,027 --> 00:16:43,663
Ooh, ooh, watch it!
Evidence.

00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,198
Where did you get it?
Cracker box.

00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:47,067
It was all stuck
together, muckety-muck.

00:16:47,134 --> 00:16:48,902
I don't want to ruin
any potential prints

00:16:48,969 --> 00:16:51,204
but I saw this TV dinner
commercial and it hit me.

00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:53,673
I'm going to put it
in the freezer.

00:16:56,409 --> 00:16:58,512
Did you try this coffee?

00:16:58,578 --> 00:16:59,713
Mm-mm.

00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,848
The last cup I had
tasted like motor oil.

00:17:01,915 --> 00:17:03,850
Oh, don't touch it.
That's my pot!

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,134
Your pot?

00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:08,637
Yeah, you know, from
my own private stash.

00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:10,205
Blue Hawaiian--
$40 a pound.

00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:13,275
Only grown a couple times
a year on the Big Island

00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:14,943
hand-picked to perfection.

00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,011
Good.

00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,112
You're using my water

00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:18,881
so I guess that makes it
community coffee.

00:17:18,947 --> 00:17:19,915
You want a cup, Nick?

00:17:19,982 --> 00:17:21,416
No, thanks.

00:17:21,483 --> 00:17:22,784
What's the matter
with your leg?

00:17:22,851 --> 00:17:23,919
I don't know, man.

00:17:23,986 --> 00:17:26,822
Something back at that house
must have bit me.

00:17:26,889 --> 00:17:29,358
Oh, is that alcohol
on a bug bite?

00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,827
That's like butter
on burns, man.

00:17:31,894 --> 00:17:33,228
Wives' tale.

00:17:33,295 --> 00:17:34,530
Yeah, this is the guy
who told me

00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:35,964
to put hemorrhoid cream
on my acne.

00:17:36,031 --> 00:17:38,467
It worked, didn't it?

00:17:41,036 --> 00:17:43,772
This is pretty good.

00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,277
Let me see the bite
before you get gangrene.

00:17:48,343 --> 00:17:49,978
Chigger bite.
Yeah?

00:17:50,045 --> 00:17:52,981
Probably picked it up
walking through the ferns
in Braun's backyard.

00:17:53,048 --> 00:17:54,783
See if Catherine's got
some clear nail polish.

00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,985
It'll seal it off from the
air, keep it from itching.

00:17:58,687 --> 00:17:59,988
What happened with
that doggy door?

00:18:00,055 --> 00:18:02,257
Something definitely two-legged
went through it.

00:18:02,324 --> 00:18:03,392
Got mostly partials.

00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,127
Print Lab's working on it now.

00:18:05,194 --> 00:18:07,996
Be sure to check it against
Janine Haywood's prints.

00:18:09,331 --> 00:18:11,867
Braun's stomach contents.

00:18:11,934 --> 00:18:13,035
No food.

00:18:13,101 --> 00:18:14,503
Plenty of drugs.

00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,304
Xanax?

00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,205
And heroin.

00:18:16,271 --> 00:18:17,206
I thought he inhaled it.

00:18:17,272 --> 00:18:19,141
Inhaled and ingested.

00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,142
He ate it?

00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:21,310
Got there somehow.

00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:24,480
Where are all the
undissolved pills?

00:18:24,546 --> 00:18:25,647
Didn't find any.

00:18:25,714 --> 00:18:29,351
Most OD's die before
digestion's complete, right?

00:18:29,418 --> 00:18:30,853
My guess, someone
mashed up the Xanax

00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:34,456
dissolved them in red wine,
which I did find.

00:18:34,523 --> 00:18:38,160
Okay, so what do we know
that we can write home about?

00:18:38,227 --> 00:18:39,795
Well, Braun was a heroin addict

00:18:39,862 --> 00:18:41,697
using heavy just before he died

00:18:41,763 --> 00:18:44,700
which means he was probably
meek as a lamb.

00:18:44,766 --> 00:18:47,736
Wouldn't have taken much to bind
his hands with duct tape.

00:18:47,803 --> 00:18:49,671
And make him drink hemlock.

00:18:49,738 --> 00:18:51,740
It's a lot easier

00:18:51,807 --> 00:18:53,142
to pour liquid
down a guy's throat

00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,910
than it is to make him
swallow 100 pills.

00:18:54,977 --> 00:18:56,678
It wasn't 100 pills.

00:18:56,745 --> 00:18:57,980
How many?

00:18:58,046 --> 00:18:59,214
Educated,
unofficial guess:

00:18:59,281 --> 00:19:00,382
No more than 50.

00:19:06,455 --> 00:19:08,490
Based on your pupes,
I could take you in right now.

00:19:08,557 --> 00:19:10,259
Hey, man, I'm in mourning.

00:19:10,325 --> 00:19:11,560
It's tears you see.

00:19:11,627 --> 00:19:12,794
I lost a customer.

00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:15,030
It's like losing
my job, kind of.

00:19:15,097 --> 00:19:16,765
You're Braun's grocery store.

00:19:16,832 --> 00:19:18,233
But I deliver.

00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,701
When did you
last deliver?

00:19:19,768 --> 00:19:21,170
Night before
he croaked.

00:19:21,236 --> 00:19:23,806
About 9:00--
ask his woman.

00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,607
She's fine, too.

00:19:25,674 --> 00:19:27,876
Well, she told us as soon as
you got there, she left.

00:19:27,943 --> 00:19:29,545
Oh, she didn't go that fast.

00:19:29,611 --> 00:19:31,180
I dropped off some balloons

00:19:31,246 --> 00:19:33,549
Braun paid me,
she gave me a tip.

00:19:33,615 --> 00:19:35,417
What, shave the soul patch?

00:19:35,484 --> 00:19:37,586
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:19:37,653 --> 00:19:38,854
No.

00:19:38,921 --> 00:19:40,422
30 Xanadus.

00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:41,456
Xanax?

00:19:41,523 --> 00:19:42,724
I told you I dropped them

00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:43,892
down the bathroom sink.

00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:46,295
First time I heard that.

00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:47,763
Look, I took two

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,132
gave Tony two

00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:51,366
and I accidentally dropped

00:19:51,433 --> 00:19:53,468
15 or 20
down the sink.

00:19:53,535 --> 00:19:55,304
It was an accident.

00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,638
You know,
an accident?

00:19:56,705 --> 00:19:58,974
Haven't you ever
spilled a drink?

00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,108
Not lately.

00:20:00,175 --> 00:20:02,578
We found 50 Xanax
in Tony's stomach.

00:20:02,644 --> 00:20:04,213
Don't pin that on me.
I'd left.

00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:06,048
I'll tell you what you left--
your fingerprints

00:20:06,114 --> 00:20:07,382
all over
the prescription bottle.

00:20:07,449 --> 00:20:08,584
I went to the pharmacy

00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,885
waited in line

00:20:09,952 --> 00:20:11,386
picked up the prescription

00:20:11,453 --> 00:20:12,554
signed for it

00:20:12,621 --> 00:20:14,323
brought it back to the house.

00:20:14,389 --> 00:20:15,591
Tony did nothing
for himself

00:20:15,657 --> 00:20:18,760
except work and get high.

00:20:18,827 --> 00:20:20,429
Got you a brand-new Mercedes,
didn't it?

00:20:20,496 --> 00:20:21,296
Yes, it did.

00:20:21,363 --> 00:20:23,732
And it'll buy me
the dress I wear

00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,501
at Tony's funeral, too.

00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:27,069
Look, when you left
your half a house

00:20:27,135 --> 00:20:28,237
where did you go?

00:20:28,303 --> 00:20:29,438
A friend's.

00:20:29,505 --> 00:20:30,439
Well, let's get her on the line.

00:20:30,506 --> 00:20:32,141
She's out of town.

00:20:32,207 --> 00:20:34,643
Let me guess--
she's incommunicado.

00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,578
That means you can't reach her?

00:20:36,645 --> 00:20:38,013
Yeah.

00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:42,117
Oh, mind the dummy.

00:20:44,253 --> 00:20:45,387
It's been 24 minutes, Greg.

00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:46,922
When's this thing
going to be done?

00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:49,591
Well, with all due respect, sir,
it's not a baked potato.

00:20:49,658 --> 00:20:50,959
It's Braun's blood

00:20:51,026 --> 00:20:52,861
and with all the impurities
in his system

00:20:52,928 --> 00:20:55,497
it might take
a little extra time.

00:20:55,564 --> 00:20:57,833
Did I ever tell you
I used to live in New York?

00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,369
Is this going to be
a short story or a novel?

00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:02,538
( <i>machine beeps</i> )
Excuse me.

00:21:03,705 --> 00:21:05,841
You know, heroin has
a nine-minute half-life.

00:21:05,908 --> 00:21:07,810
After that,
it metabolizes
into morphine.

00:21:07,876 --> 00:21:09,678
What's the six-MAM count?

00:21:09,745 --> 00:21:11,613
158 nanograms per mil.

00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,549
Definitely not lethal.

00:21:13,615 --> 00:21:14,850
The same with your Xanax.

00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:17,052
Quarter-mil tabs,
100 micrograms per liter.

00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,253
Again, not lethal.

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,088
There's addicts
walking around Times Square

00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:21,523
with more drugs in their system.

00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,726
So Braun should still
be walking around.

00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:31,633
And the point of your
New York story was...?

00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,402
Oh, I was just
going to tell you about

00:21:33,468 --> 00:21:36,138
another way to take heroin--
a suppository up the coolee.

00:21:36,205 --> 00:21:38,907
You just stand on your head,
and then you let gravity...

00:21:40,442 --> 00:21:42,211
Forget it.

00:21:49,918 --> 00:21:51,386
Braun didn't die
of a drug overdose

00:21:51,453 --> 00:21:52,654
accidental or otherwise.

00:21:52,721 --> 00:21:55,724
I figured.
So why'd I bring the dummy?

00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,529
Braun's shirt.

00:22:00,596 --> 00:22:02,264
Robbins opened him up.

00:22:02,331 --> 00:22:03,732
His lungs
were compressed.

00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:04,867
Remember Burke and Hare

00:22:04,933 --> 00:22:06,969
the two 19th century
Scottish body snatchers

00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:09,204
who made a living
intoxicating innocent victims

00:22:09,271 --> 00:22:10,672
and suffocating them?

00:22:10,739 --> 00:22:12,541
Sold their cadavers
to teaching hospitals?

00:22:12,608 --> 00:22:14,810
Got away with it, too,
until a medical student

00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:16,512
discovered his fiancee
on a slab.

00:22:16,578 --> 00:22:20,849
Is this part of
the Sherlock Holmes
Fan Club kit?

00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,718
Janine Haywood said that

00:22:22,784 --> 00:22:25,120
she left the house when
the drug dealer arrived.

00:22:25,187 --> 00:22:27,890
I think she came back.

00:22:27,956 --> 00:22:31,326
So Braun would have been on his
third or fourth balloon by then.

00:22:33,295 --> 00:22:36,565
Would have been easy
to tape his wrists

00:22:36,632 --> 00:22:37,666
mash up 50 pills...

00:22:39,635 --> 00:22:43,272
<i>and force-feed him</i>
<i>a Xanax cocktail.</i>

00:22:43,338 --> 00:22:47,376
So everything was going great
until the gardener showed up.

00:22:47,442 --> 00:22:49,378
Then I think her plan
turned to panic.

00:22:49,444 --> 00:22:53,182
It takes time to OD--
time Janine didn't have.

00:22:56,785 --> 00:22:59,054
Burke would kneel on
his victim's chest, right

00:22:59,121 --> 00:23:01,156
covering their mouth
and nostrils.

00:23:01,223 --> 00:23:03,091
But when you're
doing drugs

00:23:03,158 --> 00:23:04,893
you're a slob

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,296
and when you're
being manhandled,
you're even sloppier.

00:23:09,698 --> 00:23:11,099
Like this.

00:23:18,907 --> 00:23:20,409
He was Burked.

00:23:20,476 --> 00:23:21,944
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,448
Hello.

00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:27,950
( <i>staticky voice</i> )

00:23:28,016 --> 00:23:30,252
Where?

00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:32,454
Brass, you're breaking up.

00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:38,093
Said he was in Blue Diamond,
digging something up.

00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,696
( <i>sirens wailing</i> )

00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,122
Hey... Hey,
what's going on?

00:24:07,189 --> 00:24:09,892
Anybody ever tell you
to call before you dig?

00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,360
I got permission to be here.

00:24:13,462 --> 00:24:14,663
From who?

00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,231
A dead man?

00:24:16,298 --> 00:24:17,566
You got a name?

00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:19,501
My name's Curt Ritten.

00:24:19,568 --> 00:24:22,504
Look, Tony Braun was
a friend of mine, right?

00:24:22,571 --> 00:24:23,906
This is his property.

00:24:23,972 --> 00:24:25,207
He calls me
about a month ago.

00:24:25,274 --> 00:24:27,910
He says "If anything
should happen to me,
you start digging.

00:24:27,976 --> 00:24:30,579
You take care of what's
mine at all costs."

00:24:30,646 --> 00:24:32,047
That's what I'm doing.

00:24:32,114 --> 00:24:33,148
BRASS:
Do me a favor.

00:24:33,215 --> 00:24:35,150
Put down the shovel.

00:24:35,217 --> 00:24:37,052
Okay.

00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:38,220
Stand over there.

00:24:38,287 --> 00:24:39,154
Okay.

00:24:39,221 --> 00:24:41,690
Maybe Janine had a helper.

00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:48,931
Hey, guys, you might want
to check out the basement.

00:25:42,351 --> 00:25:46,688
"A sable cloud turns forth
its silver lining to the night."

00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:49,358
That's a lot of motive.

00:25:52,694 --> 00:25:54,696
And a lot of silver.

00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,068
Okay, three rolls of tape

00:26:33,135 --> 00:26:35,370
found in the truck
owned by Curt Ritten.

00:26:35,437 --> 00:26:36,772
Nice.

00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:39,475
Let's see if that's
where my print came from.

00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:40,642
No match!

00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:42,277
Oh, listen to you.

00:26:42,344 --> 00:26:45,314
Would you rather hit
a home run in the fourth

00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,016
or the bottom
of the ninth?

00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:49,318
Let me ask you something.

00:26:49,384 --> 00:26:50,619
Braun collected silver--

00:26:50,686 --> 00:26:52,221
coins, bullion--

00:26:52,287 --> 00:26:53,722
23 tons of it.

00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:55,891
Why bury it
in Blue Diamond?

00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:57,226
'Cause he was smart.

00:26:57,292 --> 00:26:59,528
In the past 20 years

00:26:59,595 --> 00:27:01,029
the value of silver's
gone to nothing

00:27:01,096 --> 00:27:02,865
and a commodity broker's
going to charge you

00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:04,700
a storage fee per troy ounce

00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:07,536
and there's only one thing
worse than losing

00:27:07,603 --> 00:27:09,004
seven to eight percent

00:27:09,071 --> 00:27:11,073
on silver a year

00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,574
and that's losing
nine to ten percent

00:27:12,641 --> 00:27:14,510
because of some
stupid storage fee.

00:27:14,576 --> 00:27:15,811
What good's collecting

00:27:15,878 --> 00:27:17,212
silver coupons
when you're dead?

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,914
Depends on
who's doing the clipping.

00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:22,050
Oh, we got a positive
association.

00:27:22,117 --> 00:27:24,920
Roll to tape.

00:27:24,987 --> 00:27:26,388
Curt to Tony.

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,402
You arresting me for digging?

00:27:29,468 --> 00:27:32,875
No, burglary, theft
and conspiracy, to start.

00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,944
Tony asked me
to move his silver collection

00:27:35,011 --> 00:27:36,279
up to his ranch in Wyoming.

00:27:36,346 --> 00:27:37,580
I'm doing what I was told.

00:27:37,647 --> 00:27:38,581
Mr. Ritten...

00:27:38,648 --> 00:27:40,416
it appears that
we may have

00:27:40,483 --> 00:27:42,318
physical evidence
connecting you

00:27:42,385 --> 00:27:44,020
to the murder
of Tony Braun.

00:27:44,087 --> 00:27:46,589
Look, I had nothing
to do with the drugs.

00:27:46,656 --> 00:27:48,391
I swear to you,
I haven't messed around

00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,093
with that stuff
in a long time.

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,195
I was always telling
Tony, as a friend

00:27:52,261 --> 00:27:54,564
to get off of it,
to walk away.

00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,199
How'd you know
where the silver was buried?

00:27:56,265 --> 00:27:57,667
Because I built the vault
for him.

00:27:57,734 --> 00:27:59,202
I'm a contractor.
That's what I do.

00:27:59,268 --> 00:28:00,636
Ever work on his house?

00:28:00,703 --> 00:28:01,637
No.

00:28:01,704 --> 00:28:03,106
We did... we did talk

00:28:03,172 --> 00:28:05,975
about me building a basement
for him once.

00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:07,910
It never got
off the ground.

00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,412
Oh, so,
you've been to his house?

00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,413
We were friends.

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,148
I've been to his house
plenty of times.

00:28:12,215 --> 00:28:13,516
I was there
a couple weeks ago.

00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:15,618
We were watching
the Notre Dame game together.

00:28:15,685 --> 00:28:17,120
Did you ever leave
anything there?

00:28:17,186 --> 00:28:19,222
Did you ever bring anything
over to his house?

00:28:19,288 --> 00:28:22,659
Yeah, I brought
a six-pack
and some chips--

00:28:22,725 --> 00:28:24,927
sour cream.

00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,863
Tools of the trade,
Curt.

00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:29,932
Construction items--
hammer, duct tape?

00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:30,933
No.

00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,201
Why would I do that?

00:28:32,268 --> 00:28:34,771
I got no idea
what you're talking about.

00:28:34,837 --> 00:28:38,641
Yeah, well, whatever you
don't tell us, we'll find it.

00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:48,584
That's the quickest warrant
I ever got.

00:28:48,651 --> 00:28:51,988
Yep. Braun family.
Long arms.

00:28:55,391 --> 00:28:56,492
I thought you said

00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,028
that Ritten's wife lives
in Carson City.

00:28:59,095 --> 00:29:00,029
She does.

00:29:00,096 --> 00:29:01,064
They both do.

00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:04,033
He just stays here
when he's working.

00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,102
Or digging up silver.

00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:17,280
( <i>shower running</i> )

00:29:21,818 --> 00:29:23,152
Mrs. Ritten?

00:29:24,954 --> 00:29:26,956
Criminalistics.

00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,928
VEGA:
Police officer.

00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,502
Geez!

00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,237
You scared me.

00:29:41,304 --> 00:29:42,472
How'd you get in here?

00:29:42,538 --> 00:29:45,708
I don't have to ask
<i>you</i> that question.

00:29:45,775 --> 00:29:46,709
How can this be, Mandy?

00:29:46,776 --> 00:29:48,578
We found the duct tape
in the guy's truck.

00:29:48,644 --> 00:29:49,846
SIDLE:
You're telling us

00:29:49,912 --> 00:29:51,581
the prints on that tape
aren't his or hers?

00:29:51,647 --> 00:29:53,449
Well, if their names are
Curt Ritten and Janine Haywood

00:29:53,516 --> 00:29:54,917
the answer's, "No,
it's not their prints."

00:29:54,984 --> 00:29:56,586
This is ridiculous.

00:29:56,653 --> 00:29:57,654
This thing must have a virus.

00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,555
Maybe you have
the wrong suspects.

00:29:59,622 --> 00:30:01,424
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

00:30:01,491 --> 00:30:03,426
All you do is scan prints
all day and hit "enter."

00:30:03,493 --> 00:30:05,928
Look, I'm not your
beast of burden.

00:30:05,995 --> 00:30:07,263
Sara, this is your thing.

00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,600
Mandy...
give me something dandy.

00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:12,268
I'll give you something dandy.

00:30:12,335 --> 00:30:13,970
Your doggie-door prints.

00:30:14,037 --> 00:30:15,538
Good-bye, I have to go

00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,540
on a break now.

00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,178
See what I mean?

00:30:22,245 --> 00:30:23,746
Your prints came back unknown,
too?

00:30:23,813 --> 00:30:25,415
No.

00:30:25,481 --> 00:30:27,083
Came back Walt Braun.

00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,418
Who is he?

00:30:28,484 --> 00:30:30,586
He's Tony Braun's brother.

00:30:30,653 --> 00:30:32,288
He's a pit boss
at the Tangiers

00:30:32,355 --> 00:30:35,091
which is why his
prints were on file--
gaming card.

00:30:35,158 --> 00:30:36,459
He's family.

00:30:36,526 --> 00:30:39,262
Why's he using the doggie door
and not the front door?

00:30:39,329 --> 00:30:40,496
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
Go figure.

00:30:40,563 --> 00:30:42,065
The more evidence
that shows up

00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,000
the more this case
doesn't make sense.

00:30:44,067 --> 00:30:45,501
We got two suspects
in custody

00:30:45,568 --> 00:30:48,037
and neither of their prints
are on the duct tape.

00:30:48,104 --> 00:30:50,039
Or on the doggie door...

00:30:50,106 --> 00:30:51,541
but the brother's are.

00:30:51,607 --> 00:30:52,642
Mm-hmm.

00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:53,643
So, call the print lab.

00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,644
It's been done.

00:30:54,711 --> 00:30:56,979
They're not Walt Braun's
prints on the tape.

00:30:57,046 --> 00:30:58,981
Came back unknown.

00:30:59,048 --> 00:31:00,783
Hey.

00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,920
I've got Detective Vega
rounding up Walt Braun.

00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:07,223
Apparently, this
Janine Haywood
really got around.

00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,225
<i>When she wasn't</i>
<i>at Braun's house</i>

00:31:09,292 --> 00:31:12,428
<i>playing girlfriend,</i>
she's over at "Vault Boy's"
flat

00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,930
<i>playing mistress...</i>

00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:16,799
<i>which gives neither of them</i>
<i>a credible alibi.</i>

00:31:16,866 --> 00:31:19,002
Flimsy alibis
don't prove murder.

00:31:19,068 --> 00:31:20,570
What else have we got?

00:31:20,636 --> 00:31:21,571
Nothing probative.

00:31:21,637 --> 00:31:23,406
BRASS:
Then I let the
girlfriend go.

00:31:23,473 --> 00:31:26,009
Curt Ritten goes back to
lock-up until he posts bail.

00:31:26,075 --> 00:31:27,010
Look, forget Curt.

00:31:27,076 --> 00:31:29,178
Forget Janine.
Forget the suspects.

00:31:29,245 --> 00:31:30,179
It's simple.

00:31:30,246 --> 00:31:32,615
We got to figure out
how a piece of duct tape

00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,384
from a roll we found
in Curt Ritten's truck

00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,452
ended up wrapped
around the wrists of our victim.

00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,121
Without Curt's prints on it.

00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:40,957
( <i>speaking indistinctly</i> )

00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,325
Curt, we're out of here.

00:31:42,392 --> 00:31:44,594
Oh, you're going
to take this, too, huh?

00:31:44,661 --> 00:31:46,429
CURT:
Bonnie...

00:31:46,496 --> 00:31:48,598
I come down here with a check
to bail <i>my</i> husband out

00:31:48,665 --> 00:31:50,299
and you say to him,
"We're out of here"?

00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,367
No, honey,
you're out of here!

00:31:51,434 --> 00:31:52,368
CURT:
Bonnie, take it easy.

00:31:52,435 --> 00:31:53,970
BONNIE:
Take it easy?!

00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,838
How many men
do you need, huh?

00:31:55,905 --> 00:31:57,373
Hey, at least I can take care
of mine.

00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,642
I've stuck by you
through the bankruptcies

00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,045
the flings, the lies,
and I have had it, okay?

00:32:02,111 --> 00:32:03,046
So, you choose.

00:32:03,112 --> 00:32:04,714
Me or her?

00:32:04,781 --> 00:32:07,050
Sorry, Janine.

00:32:07,116 --> 00:32:08,384
Yeah...

00:32:08,451 --> 00:32:10,019
Heard that before.

00:32:11,688 --> 00:32:13,489
JANINE:
Call me.

00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,558
BRASS:
Bail processing is

00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:16,759
this way.

00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,435
Been there.

00:32:25,501 --> 00:32:26,569
MAN:
<i>You came down here</i>

00:32:26,636 --> 00:32:28,237
to ask me
about a doggie door?

00:32:28,304 --> 00:32:30,540
I could've just told you
over the phone.

00:32:30,606 --> 00:32:31,541
It's a quirk.

00:32:31,607 --> 00:32:34,010
I always like to discuss
fingerprints in person.

00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,745
Hmm. Tony and I went
to dinner.

00:32:35,812 --> 00:32:36,679
How long ago?

00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,915
A while back.

00:32:38,981 --> 00:32:40,516
Be more specific.

00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,851
Uh, about a month
and a half ago.

00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,720
We ate at Piero's

00:32:43,786 --> 00:32:46,255
talked a little business--
I dropped him off.

00:32:46,322 --> 00:32:48,057
TONY:
Walt...

00:32:48,124 --> 00:32:49,359
( <i>no audio</i> )

00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,660
My key still works here.

00:32:50,727 --> 00:32:53,029
How come it doesn't work
on the front door?

00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,731
I changed the locks.

00:32:54,797 --> 00:32:56,599
WALT:
<i>And, so,</i>
<i>I used the doggie door</i>

00:32:56,666 --> 00:33:00,203
walked through the house,
opened the door, let Tony in.

00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:03,039
Guy with that kind of money
doesn't have a security alarm?

00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,040
When you're a Braun

00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,508
there's nothing
you can't replace.

00:33:05,575 --> 00:33:08,845
You can't replace
your brother.

00:33:08,911 --> 00:33:11,614
What's the matter with your leg?

00:33:11,681 --> 00:33:13,616
I don't know.
Something must've bit me.

00:33:13,683 --> 00:33:15,051
Mind if I take a look?

00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,719
What are you,
a dermatologist?

00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,655
I'm an entomologist,
actually.

00:33:18,721 --> 00:33:20,289
I-I know all about bugs.

00:33:20,356 --> 00:33:21,124
Sure.

00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,459
Can you tell me
what to put on it?

00:33:23,526 --> 00:33:24,794
It's killing me.

00:33:24,861 --> 00:33:26,429
Chigger bites.

00:33:27,697 --> 00:33:31,300
You might want to
try some nail polish,
keep it from itching.

00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:33,569
Would you mind if I
took a photograph

00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,038
for my bite collection?

00:33:35,104 --> 00:33:37,473
Whatever rubs
your Buddha.

00:33:43,546 --> 00:33:44,914
We're almost done.

00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,116
Mr. Braun, uh,
where do you live?

00:33:47,183 --> 00:33:48,918
Shoshone Hi-Rise--
J.W. Brown Road.

00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,320
VEGA:
And you work here?

00:33:50,386 --> 00:33:52,588
Yeah, I'm a glorified pit boss.

00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:53,656
In the, uh,
last 48 hours

00:33:53,723 --> 00:33:55,458
have you been anywhere else

00:33:55,525 --> 00:33:57,160
besides those two places?

00:33:57,226 --> 00:33:58,328
WALT:
No.

00:33:58,394 --> 00:34:00,797
My life's pretty routine.

00:34:01,964 --> 00:34:05,101
It might just get
a little more routine.

00:34:10,406 --> 00:34:12,342
GRISSOM:
Nick, I need your leg.

00:34:12,408 --> 00:34:13,609
Show me your bite.

00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,244
Oh, it's no worries.
I got some cream.

00:34:15,311 --> 00:34:15,845
Hey.

00:34:15,912 --> 00:34:17,580
All right.

00:34:17,647 --> 00:34:19,382
It's no big deal,
really.

00:34:28,491 --> 00:34:31,327
What time did you log in
at the Braun house?

00:34:31,394 --> 00:34:32,662
9:15 that morning.

00:34:32,729 --> 00:34:35,098
How long after
that did you start
processing the backyard?

00:34:35,164 --> 00:34:36,099
About a half hour.

00:34:36,165 --> 00:34:39,769
You're not the only one
with chigger bites.

00:34:39,836 --> 00:34:41,137
Who is this?

00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,672
Walt Braun.

00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:44,540
It's now 9:30 at night.

00:34:44,607 --> 00:34:47,110
Approximately 36 hours
ago, you were bitten.

00:34:47,176 --> 00:34:48,811
Three hours
earlier than that

00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,279
Tony Braun was murdered.

00:34:50,346 --> 00:34:52,048
Chiggers run a
predictable course.

00:34:52,115 --> 00:34:55,284
<i>A chigger attaches itself</i>
<i>to a hair follicle</i>

00:34:55,351 --> 00:34:57,587
<i>injects a digest enzyme</i>
<i>into the skin</i>

00:34:57,654 --> 00:34:59,856
<i>which ruptures</i>
<i>the surrounding cells</i>

00:34:59,922 --> 00:35:02,892
allowing the chigger
to suck them up

00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:05,695
leaving behind a
red, itchy bump.

00:35:05,762 --> 00:35:06,829
So...?

00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,631
Walt Braun lied.

00:35:08,698 --> 00:35:10,800
We now have an
entomological timeline

00:35:10,867 --> 00:35:14,671
that places him at
the house on the day
his brother was murdered.

00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:15,905
I don't know, Boss.

00:35:15,972 --> 00:35:17,674
I mean,
ask yourself the question--

00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,977
are doggie-door prints
and chigger bites enough

00:35:21,044 --> 00:35:22,779
to get a man for murder?

00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:35,085
What've we got?

00:35:35,152 --> 00:35:36,420
Well, I got motive.

00:35:36,486 --> 00:35:38,889
According to the
family lawyer,
the drug addict...

00:35:38,956 --> 00:35:41,224
Now, Jim, that's just
a little callous.

00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:42,292
I'm calling it what it is.

00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:43,794
I know you're friends
with the family

00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,662
but the guy used heroin.
He was a drug addict

00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:46,964
who stood in line

00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,732
to inherit
the old man's fortune.

00:35:48,799 --> 00:35:49,733
What about the brother?

00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,535
Walt's out of the picture.
Out in the cold.

00:35:51,601 --> 00:35:52,536
He is?
Yeah.

00:35:52,602 --> 00:35:54,705
Tony promised he'd
take care of him.

00:35:54,771 --> 00:35:56,707
Whatever he got,
he'd split 50-50

00:35:56,773 --> 00:35:58,241
all in...

00:35:58,308 --> 00:35:59,276
silver included...

00:35:59,343 --> 00:36:00,577
up until about
a month ago.

00:36:00,644 --> 00:36:03,647
But Tony changed his mind,
which changed the will.

00:36:03,714 --> 00:36:06,016
WILLOWS:
So, wait a second--
Janine, the stripper

00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,918
claims that half
of everything is hers

00:36:07,985 --> 00:36:10,487
so that's actually more
than just wishful thinking?

00:36:10,554 --> 00:36:12,456
Bet Walt wasn't too
happy about that.

00:36:12,522 --> 00:36:14,958
It's 50-50 going 75-25
the wrong way.

00:36:15,025 --> 00:36:17,694
Curt was digging up the silver
to protect Janine's interest.

00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:20,097
So, what's right in front of us
that we're missing?

00:36:20,163 --> 00:36:21,865
What evidence do we have
that's still open?

00:36:21,932 --> 00:36:23,367
Got the references
off of Walt Braun

00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:25,335
gave the samples to Greg.

00:36:25,402 --> 00:36:26,536
SIDLE:
Couple of things

00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:28,372
on the list that haven't
been processed yet:

00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:31,508
Tape lifts, adhesive residue,
I got the earring back.

00:36:31,575 --> 00:36:33,010
Where'd you find that?

00:36:33,076 --> 00:36:34,111
Living room, near the body.

00:36:34,177 --> 00:36:36,079
We have to deal
with that earring.

00:36:36,146 --> 00:36:37,614
We got to test it
against Janine.

00:36:37,681 --> 00:36:39,216
You want to swab me,
go ahead

00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:40,617
but I can save you the Q-Tip.

00:36:40,684 --> 00:36:41,952
That's really not my style.

00:36:42,019 --> 00:36:43,253
Ms. Haywood...

00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,555
you have pierced ears.
Yeah.

00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:47,891
He doesn't understand.
I don't wear studs.

00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:49,593
Haven't worn studs
since, like...

00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,595
God, seventh grade.

00:36:51,662 --> 00:36:52,963
Mm-hmm.

00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:55,632
Can I see that picture?

00:36:55,699 --> 00:36:58,769
Thanks. See?

00:36:58,835 --> 00:37:01,238
This is an earring back.
It goes to a stud earring.

00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:03,440
I don't wear studs.
I'm more of, like,
a dangle gal.

00:37:03,507 --> 00:37:04,975
I like chandeliers.
They move with you.

00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:06,610
They're on wires.
They don't have a back.

00:37:06,677 --> 00:37:08,912
Are you finished?

00:37:08,979 --> 00:37:10,948
Open your mouth.

00:37:13,116 --> 00:37:15,786
Don't bite down.
Wouldn't want you
to swallow it.

00:37:15,852 --> 00:37:17,421
GRISSOM:
How about your
girlfriends

00:37:17,487 --> 00:37:21,258
or Tony's girlfriends--
any of them wear studs?

00:37:21,325 --> 00:37:24,494
Look, rule number one:
no women allowed in the house.

00:37:24,561 --> 00:37:26,930
Tony had a wandering eye,
he had a wad of cash

00:37:26,997 --> 00:37:29,333
who needed that drama?
What about the maid?

00:37:29,399 --> 00:37:31,201
No. Rule number two:

00:37:31,268 --> 00:37:35,172
Heavyset, over 50, no makeup,
no jewelry, no English.

00:37:35,238 --> 00:37:36,707
Wow.
You got this whole thing down

00:37:36,773 --> 00:37:37,741
don't you?

00:37:37,808 --> 00:37:39,276
Yeah. This is my house.

00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:41,078
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:37:41,144 --> 00:37:43,413
And I inherited Josie,
and she cleans real good.

00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,781
How often does she vacuum?

00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:46,950
Every day.

00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:48,685
Except on her day off.

00:37:48,752 --> 00:37:50,854
Hmm. The day Tony died.

00:37:50,921 --> 00:37:52,990
Hmm.

00:37:53,056 --> 00:37:55,125
Well, if the maid is
as good as Janine
says she is...

00:37:55,192 --> 00:37:57,861
then the earring back
was lost that day.

00:37:59,763 --> 00:38:02,265
There. Well, maybe not.

00:38:02,332 --> 00:38:03,934
The earring back--
not Janine's.

00:38:04,001 --> 00:38:05,769
But it was in the ear
of a female.

00:38:05,836 --> 00:38:07,671
So, I guess rule number one
was broken.

00:38:07,738 --> 00:38:09,773
There was a woman
in the house.

00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,742
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

00:38:11,808 --> 00:38:14,878
Whoever's prints are
on the duct tape is
missing an earring back.

00:38:14,945 --> 00:38:16,780
Who's the only other
woman in the story?

00:38:16,847 --> 00:38:18,115
She lives in Carson City.

00:38:18,181 --> 00:38:20,384
She's here now.
She has access
to Curt's truck.

00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,519
We saw the fight in
the police department.

00:38:22,586 --> 00:38:24,021
"Hell hath no fury..."

00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:28,158
It's not mine.
I don't wear earrings.

00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:29,526
GRISSOM:
It's funny,
just recently

00:38:29,593 --> 00:38:31,528
I had a little
education in earrings

00:38:31,595 --> 00:38:33,563
and I noticed that
you have pierced ears.

00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,665
Yeah. So what?

00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:37,668
If you don't wear
earrings for a while

00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:39,136
the holes will close up.

00:38:39,202 --> 00:38:41,872
BRASS:
Will you volunteer
as a DNA sample?

00:38:41,938 --> 00:38:44,808
It will confirm your story
or confirm ours.

00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:46,576
I'm not giving you anything.

00:38:46,643 --> 00:38:49,012
It's okay, Jim,
we have enough.

00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,648
You should let your
husband rot in jail.

00:38:51,715 --> 00:38:54,251
We lifted your thumbprint

00:38:54,318 --> 00:38:56,687
from the check that you posted
for his bail.

00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:59,089
GRISSOM:
We compared it to a
set of unknown prints

00:38:59,156 --> 00:39:01,558
that we found on
some duct tape
at the crime scene.

00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:03,994
WILLOWS:
Just like a pair of
earrings-- identical.

00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:06,863
So you were at Tony's house
the morning he died.

00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,932
<i>Along with Walt Braun</i>

00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:11,635
<i>whose prints we confirmed</i>
<i>on the doggy door.</i>

00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:23,380
( <i>Tony groaning</i> )

00:39:31,355 --> 00:39:34,958
GRISSOM:
You know, sometimes,
doing the job that we do

00:39:35,025 --> 00:39:39,196
our biggest break comes from
the most innocent circumstance.

00:39:39,262 --> 00:39:43,266
It was the maid's day off,
but not the gardener's.

00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:45,202
That's the thing about murder

00:39:45,268 --> 00:39:47,404
you never think
to have a backup plan.

00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:50,240
The dogs lead him
right to you...

00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:51,608
( <i>dogs barking</i> )

00:39:51,675 --> 00:39:53,477
so you had to wing it.

00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,350
The gardener came
to the window...

00:40:00,417 --> 00:40:02,119
( <i>dogs barking</i> )

00:40:02,185 --> 00:40:04,421
<i>but he didn't see you...</i>

00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:07,224
so you removed the tape
from Tony's wrists...

00:40:07,291 --> 00:40:09,826
and made it look like
an OD.

00:40:09,893 --> 00:40:11,928
WILLOWS:
What I don't get is

00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:16,133
you and Walt Braun
didn't move in the same circles.

00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:18,201
How'd the two of you hook up?

00:40:21,371 --> 00:40:24,841
News flash, sweetheart:

00:40:24,908 --> 00:40:27,477
Can't make a deal
if you keep your mouth shut.

00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:35,786
That's the thing
about my father:

00:40:35,852 --> 00:40:38,588
He could never give advice

00:40:38,655 --> 00:40:42,292
but he had a million stories.

00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:44,661
"Scorpion and the Frog."

00:40:44,728 --> 00:40:48,165
Scorpion needed
to get across
the creek

00:40:48,231 --> 00:40:50,934
and asked the frog
for a ride.

00:40:51,001 --> 00:40:55,605
Frog says, "I can't trust you,
you're a scorpion."

00:40:55,672 --> 00:40:58,408
Scorpion says, "Sure you can."

00:40:58,475 --> 00:41:00,877
Hops on the frog's back.

00:41:02,779 --> 00:41:06,516
Midway across,
the scorpion stings the frog.

00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:10,020
Frog looks at him.

00:41:10,087 --> 00:41:13,357
"Why would you do that?

00:41:13,423 --> 00:41:15,525
Now we're both gonna die."

00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:20,564
Scorpion says...

00:41:23,033 --> 00:41:27,437
"I can't help it.
I'm a scorpion."

00:41:29,773 --> 00:41:34,077
If Tony hadn't thrown a party...

00:41:34,144 --> 00:41:37,247
the two of us would never
have been standing at that bar.

00:41:37,314 --> 00:41:39,683
Hey, Janine,
you're lookin' good.

00:41:52,529 --> 00:41:54,431
You're looking
at my brother's trophy?

00:41:54,498 --> 00:41:57,167
No, my husband's bimbo.

00:41:57,234 --> 00:41:59,936
Walt Braun.

00:42:00,003 --> 00:42:02,606
Bonnie Ritten.

00:42:03,974 --> 00:42:07,144
And an opportunity
presented itself.

00:42:08,478 --> 00:42:11,348
Tony had erased you
from the will

00:42:11,415 --> 00:42:14,885
and Bonnie wanted the people
that hurt her to pay.

00:42:16,253 --> 00:42:18,288
Ain't love grand?

00:42:24,094 --> 00:42:27,125
You know, this...
this could've all been his.

00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:29,399
His and Tony's.

00:42:30,542 --> 00:42:31,401
It's not your fault.

00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:33,470
Sure it is.

00:42:35,305 --> 00:42:38,442
I committed
the cardinal sin.

00:42:38,508 --> 00:42:41,912
I loved one son
more than the other.

00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:44,081
It's human nature.

00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:46,550
We can't deny
our feelings.

00:42:46,617 --> 00:42:49,152
But you can hide it.

00:42:49,219 --> 00:42:51,688
And I didn't.

00:42:51,755 --> 00:42:54,491
And my sons...

00:42:54,558 --> 00:42:57,928
I made them,
I raised them...

00:42:57,995 --> 00:43:00,330
and one kills the other.

00:43:00,397 --> 00:43:04,201
Hey, Sam...
you still got me.

00:43:06,003 --> 00:43:08,438
You know, I should've
married your mother.

00:43:08,505 --> 00:43:10,941
Well, considering
I was six months old

00:43:11,008 --> 00:43:13,010
when you guys lit the flame...

00:43:13,076 --> 00:43:15,379
a lot of time has passed.

00:43:15,445 --> 00:43:17,981
You had plenty of chances.

00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:21,685
Just wasn't in the cards,
Catherine.

00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:27,250
It just wasn't
in the cards.
