Couldn't stand the heat,

What can we do?

00:12:20,647 --> 00:12:22,282
Just let me do my job.

00:12:22,348 --> 00:12:23,283
This is our

00:12:23,349 --> 00:12:25,151
daughter, we can't
just be <i>observers.</i>

00:12:25,218 --> 00:12:26,853
No, we won't.
We're part of this.

00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,854
Look.

00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:29,022
What no one's telling you

00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:31,391
is that the only tangible
connection you have left

00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,792
between you and your daughter

00:12:32,859 --> 00:12:34,761
is the evidence
that my team is collecting

00:12:34,828 --> 00:12:36,629
and how we interpret it.

00:12:36,696 --> 00:12:38,698
So, please...

00:12:38,765 --> 00:12:40,300
let me think.

00:12:56,683 --> 00:12:58,918
You showered.

00:12:58,985 --> 00:13:01,488
Thanks for noticing, Gil,
you're very observant.

00:13:01,554 --> 00:13:03,456
GRISSOM:
Yeah? Well...

00:13:03,523 --> 00:13:06,493
I can't tell what
I'm observing here.

00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:10,930
What does that
look like?

00:13:10,997 --> 00:13:13,466
A five-foot-eleven workaholic.

00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:17,437
Sorry.

00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:18,938
It looks like somebody

00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:20,907
carrying... something.

00:13:20,974 --> 00:13:22,275
Paige Rycoff

00:13:22,342 --> 00:13:24,144
was missing a rug from her room.

00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,445
Hello.

00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:26,980
Got an ID off
my print.

00:13:27,046 --> 00:13:29,149
I know who covered
the cameras.

00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,650
Good.

00:13:30,717 --> 00:13:33,520
We know what he might've
carried out.

00:13:37,157 --> 00:13:40,059
It's a hand.

00:13:40,126 --> 00:13:41,928
It's <i>your</i> hand.
( <i>scoffing</i> )

00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:43,997
Okay, if you say so.

00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,532
Hey, your <i>fingerprints</i> say so.

00:13:48,234 --> 00:13:51,771
Okay. I'll cop to it.

00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:55,008
But I'm not copping to it alone.

00:13:58,645 --> 00:14:00,680
Pledge prank.

00:14:00,747 --> 00:14:02,082
You boosted a carpet
and a couch?

00:14:02,148 --> 00:14:03,950
We <i>borrowed--</i> we borrowed
some stuff from the lounge

00:14:04,017 --> 00:14:05,085
but we were going
to return it.

00:14:05,151 --> 00:14:06,086
When?

00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:07,420
After you graduate?

00:14:07,487 --> 00:14:09,489
What else did you
take, Henry?

00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:11,524
Ohhh...

00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:13,526
Two lamps, coffee table

00:14:13,593 --> 00:14:15,995
couple rolls
of toilet paper.

00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:16,996
Look, I'll pay for it.

00:14:17,063 --> 00:14:18,331
Why the fourth floor?

00:14:18,398 --> 00:14:19,332
Uh...

00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:20,333
The fourth, fifth

00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,168
and seventh floor
have the primo goods.

00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:23,503
Okay?

00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,205
Fourth floor's closer
to the ground

00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:26,573
less stairs.

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,809
Faster we can get out of the
building and into the van

00:14:29,876 --> 00:14:31,611
faster we get
out of there.

00:14:36,282 --> 00:14:37,917
Do you know Paige Rycoff?

00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:47,393
Yeah.

00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,295
Yeah, but I had
nothing to do with...

00:14:49,362 --> 00:14:52,866
with that or whatever
happened to her.

00:14:52,932 --> 00:14:54,033
But you do know her.

00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,034
Well, yeah.

00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:57,337
You know, we live
in the same dorm.

00:14:57,403 --> 00:15:00,073
We're in Economics 101
together, so what?

00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,674
So what?
Paige and I

00:15:01,741 --> 00:15:04,611
dated once or twice.

00:15:04,677 --> 00:15:06,212
She wasn't my type.

00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:08,148
If you haven't
noticed...

00:15:08,214 --> 00:15:10,350
I'm in the system now.

00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:12,252
The talent pool's
pretty deep.

00:15:12,318 --> 00:15:13,586
She dumped you.

00:15:16,656 --> 00:15:19,659
Guy like you, it had to be
a blow to your ego.

00:15:19,726 --> 00:15:22,495
Maybe you tried
to change her mind.

00:15:22,562 --> 00:15:25,198
All right, come on, listen.
It wasn't like that.

00:15:25,265 --> 00:15:26,900
It wasn't like that at all.

00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:29,369
Come on, Paige was seeing
another guy.

00:15:29,436 --> 00:15:30,937
Someone who was

00:15:31,004 --> 00:15:32,872
"more mature" than I am.

00:15:32,939 --> 00:15:34,441
You got a name
on this other guy?

00:15:34,507 --> 00:15:38,344
No. She never said.

00:15:42,482 --> 00:15:43,850
You can go.

00:15:45,685 --> 00:15:48,488
But the stuff
gets returned.

00:15:48,555 --> 00:15:50,190
Yes, sir.

00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:56,062
From hot to cold in a minute.

00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:57,597
This is the worst place
you can be

00:15:57,664 --> 00:16:00,934
on a missing person...
a dead end.

00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:04,126
REPORTER:
The parents

00:16:04,193 --> 00:16:06,596
of Western Las Vegas University
freshman, Paige Rycoff.

00:16:06,662 --> 00:16:09,866
They join us now to discuss
their daughter's disappearance.

00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,178
Mrs. Rycoff,
did your daughter tell you why

00:16:13,244 --> 00:16:15,013
she was leaving school?

00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:18,249
We're a close family,
and Paige just felt

00:16:18,316 --> 00:16:20,852
she needed to be
home... with us.

00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:24,322
But why leave mid semester?

00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:25,457
I asked her...

00:16:25,523 --> 00:16:27,692
She was going to make
a fresh start back in Boulder.

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,727
I need you in the lab.

00:16:30,794 --> 00:16:32,931
You know, when a tree
falls in the forest

00:16:32,997 --> 00:16:35,633
even if no one's
there to hear it

00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,203
it does, in fact,
make a sound.

00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:42,540
Yes. Somebody must have
seen or heard something.

00:16:42,607 --> 00:16:44,742
What have we got?

00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:47,312
SANDERS:
Well, this is one way
to get her DNA.

00:16:47,378 --> 00:16:49,013
Bring me her
whole life.

00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,748
It's called zeal, Greg.

00:16:50,815 --> 00:16:52,350
Or overkill.

00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:53,785
It's called protocol.

00:16:53,852 --> 00:16:55,220
Let's get on with it.

00:16:56,166 --> 00:17:00,208
Okay, well, I, uh,
got Paige's DNA from her toothbrush.

00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,667
I compared it to
the blood and semen
that Sara found

00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:04,035
on the mattress
in her dorm room.

00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:06,337
Blood's not hers.

00:17:06,404 --> 00:17:07,972
Not hers?
That's not all.

00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:10,007
Check out the tox screen.

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,502
Rohypnol?

00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:16,903
Date rape drug.

00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,939
What about the semen?

00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:21,208
Well, the vaginal contribution
to the semen stain

00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:22,376
is a match to the blood.

00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,478
Whose blood,
don't know.

00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:28,582
We may have two victims--
one missing, one raped.

00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:31,752
STOKES:
There's our boys

00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:33,887
about to move
their "borrowed" furniture.

00:17:33,954 --> 00:17:40,327
Advance it to 8:27 p.m.

00:17:43,964 --> 00:17:46,333
Okay, I think
the table's set.

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,001
Cab double-parked.

00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,236
He calls up.

00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:51,171
Paige says that
she'll be right down.

00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,440
And he becomes
the world's most patient cabbie.

00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,045
And just like he tells Brass...

00:17:58,111 --> 00:17:59,746
he waits 15 minutes.

00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:01,548
13 minutes.
27 seconds

00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:02,816
according to the timecode.

00:18:02,883 --> 00:18:03,917
Close enough.

00:18:03,984 --> 00:18:05,452
Let's get back out
in the field.

00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:06,620
Tech can finish up here.

00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:07,921
Hey, where's
the fire, Bud?

00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:09,222
We're just
getting started.

00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,323
These security cameras

00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,325
are the only witnesses
we've got.

00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:13,727
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:17,330
I'll, uh, settle in.

00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:18,875
Good idea.

00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,300
BRASS:
Jennifer Riggs--

00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:21,368
missing girl's
roommate.

00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:22,736
She dropped out
of school, too

00:18:22,803 --> 00:18:24,071
about a month
and a half ago.

00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,272
That dorm room is cursed.

00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:26,940
Is this
her parents' house?

00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:28,108
Yeah.

00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:29,409
Possible sexual assault

00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,745
so I thought I'd wait
for the whole team.

00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:34,347
You thought you should,
uh, wait for a female.

00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:37,451
WOMAN( <i>over TV</i> ):
A video shot during
the first week of school

00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:41,041
offers fresh insight
into the 18-year-old's personality.

00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:44,391
We can see that Paige was
an average, apparently happy

00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,127
and healthy freshman,
looking forward to...

00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:50,330
How did you guys
even find out about me?

00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:52,666
I mean, I-I didn't report it.

00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:55,602
I just... ran.

00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:58,238
And I left school.

00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:02,008
Nobody knew, not even Paige.

00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:04,344
Jennifer, we found
forensic evidence

00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:05,846
in your old dorm room.

00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:07,781
We believe you were

00:19:07,848 --> 00:19:12,219
sexually assaulted
under the influence of Rohypnol.

00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:15,322
And now you guys think
the guy that attacked me

00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:18,425
had something to do
with Paige's disappearance?

00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:19,926
Two women.

00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,062
Same dorm room.

00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:24,564
We're looking for a connection.

00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,102
Will you tell us his name?

00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,706
( <i>shaky breathing</i> )

00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:36,376
Do you want to talk alone?

00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:37,778
You don't understand.

00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,115
I can't remember.

00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,551
I never could remember.

00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:47,721
That's one of the side effects
of Rohypnol.

00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:50,257
I'm sure he was counting
on that.

00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,166
There was this party...

00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:11,445
Who was at this party?

00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:16,483
It was a floor party.

00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,821
That's why
I had to leave school.

00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:26,159
Somebody that I was living with
attacked me...

00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:29,763
and I was never
going to know who.

00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:38,805
SIDLE:
Why would a rapist
voluntarily give up his DNA?

00:20:38,872 --> 00:20:41,241
Officially, we're looking
for the individual

00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:42,676
who abducted Paige Rycoff

00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:44,978
not the student
who raped Jennifer Riggs.

00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:46,613
Oh, so as long
as the students

00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,948
participate voluntarily

00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:49,883
we can use their DNA
as we see fit.

00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,485
Ah, the old
bait and switch.

00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:52,619
Yo, smart and legal.

00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:54,521
Yeah, but what if
someone refuses?

00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:56,189
That's what we're hoping for.

00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,024
De facto suspect.

00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:11,538
Open.

00:21:12,873 --> 00:21:14,174
Are you refusing?

00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:16,410
I haven't brushed my teeth.

00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:18,512
Hey, mouth boy,
she's not going to kiss you.

00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:20,047
She just wants your DNA, okay?

00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,937
( <i>beeps</i> )

00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:48,341
Friederich Miescher
requests my presence?

00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:50,143
Figured out my code, huh?

00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,812
Well, you know,
my boy Freddy

00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:53,780
discovered DNA.

00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:56,249
He's been dead a
hundred years, Greg.
What do you got?

00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:59,486
Well, I ran the samples
on Cofiler and Profiler Plus.

00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:01,488
Then I compared each specimen
against the types

00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:02,656
obtained from the dried semen

00:22:02,723 --> 00:22:04,324
that you found
on the victim's mattress...

00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:06,793
Are we paying you
by the word?

00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:17,671
13 markers.

00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:20,340
13 matches.

00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:22,142
One suspect.

00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:23,643
Thank you.

00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:31,618
Kevin Watson,
19, room 407

00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:34,221
just down the hall
from our girls.

00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:35,956
Athletic director says

00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,924
he plays first base,
bats right-handed.

00:22:37,991 --> 00:22:39,092
Any record?

00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:41,495
Three Ds and a "C,"
nothing criminal.

00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:44,331
Number 25, just
like McGwire.

00:22:44,398 --> 00:22:47,134
Yeah? I wonder
how he hits.

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,770
Listen, Kevin,
we know that
you assaulted

00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:51,104
Jennifer Riggs.

00:22:51,171 --> 00:22:53,673
Why don't you just tell us
about Paige Rycoff.

00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,510
I don't know anything
about Paige... or Jennifer.

00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:58,378
Well, I'll tell
you what I know.

00:22:58,445 --> 00:23:00,047
Jennifer Riggs was raped.

00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:02,082
We found semen
on her mattress.

00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:03,850
We matched the seminal DNA

00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:06,286
to you.

00:23:06,353 --> 00:23:07,421
Q-tip down my throat.

00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:08,555
Thought you were here

00:23:08,622 --> 00:23:10,791
trying to find out
what happened to Paige.

00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:12,359
We are.

00:23:12,426 --> 00:23:14,227
So what did happen,
Kevin?

00:23:14,294 --> 00:23:15,562
You attack Paige, too?

00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:17,531
Hell, you been
in her room before

00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:18,965
but unlike her roommate

00:23:19,032 --> 00:23:20,801
Paige fought back,
is that it?

00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:22,636
I never touched Paige.

00:23:22,703 --> 00:23:24,071
I wasn't even in town.

00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:25,872
Three ball games in Fresno.

00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:27,407
We got back yesterday.

00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:28,875
Check the roster.

00:23:28,942 --> 00:23:30,177
Ask Coach.

00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:31,178
No, I'll do that

00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:32,946
but in the meantime,
you're coming with us.

00:23:33,013 --> 00:23:34,247
You're under arrest
for the use

00:23:34,314 --> 00:23:36,550
of a controlled substance
in the sexual assault

00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:37,551
on Jennifer Riggs.

00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:38,418
Get him out of here.

00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:40,921
Wait for me.

00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:43,657
Wait for me in the car.

00:23:47,294 --> 00:23:49,262
Another dead end.

00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:50,931
Yeah, I know,
I talked to the coach.

00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,699
Road trip.

00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:54,768
We're losing her.

00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,885
And there it is again.

00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,903
STOKES:
You know, that car
circled the block six times

00:24:03,969 --> 00:24:07,640
between... 8:20
and 8:40 p.m.

00:24:07,706 --> 00:24:09,575
All right,
you loop around twice

00:24:09,642 --> 00:24:11,710
you're looking
for a parking space.

00:24:11,777 --> 00:24:13,112
Six times...

00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:15,147
STOKES:
You're up to no good.

00:24:15,214 --> 00:24:18,350
Is that something hanging
from the rearview mirror?

00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:23,456
Why don't you zoom in on that.

00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:39,405
You know, it's easier to
get a master's degree than
a parking spot on campus.

00:24:39,472 --> 00:24:42,308
Right. Why don't you meet up
with University Parking

00:24:42,374 --> 00:24:44,944
and cross-reference
all silver Volvos.

00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,145
Right.

00:24:46,212 --> 00:24:47,480
Oh, and Nick?

00:24:47,546 --> 00:24:48,981
Yeah?

00:24:49,048 --> 00:24:50,015
When you find the car...

00:24:50,082 --> 00:24:52,685
I know-- check the trunk.

00:24:56,455 --> 00:25:01,093
Silver Volvo. University I.D.

00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,631
A world of possibilities
reduced to a single car?

00:25:05,698 --> 00:25:09,602
Registered to Robert
Woodbury, philosophy
professor, tenured.

00:25:09,668 --> 00:25:11,971
Detail's almost
got the latch.

00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,530
Nick, tow it to CSI
and process.

00:25:37,596 --> 00:25:39,398
Cath...

00:25:39,465 --> 00:25:41,792
Office hours
with the professor.

00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:43,794
MAN:
<i>Yes...</i>

00:25:43,861 --> 00:25:45,629
I was near the dorm that night.

00:25:45,696 --> 00:25:51,769
Professor Woodbury,
you circled the block six times.

00:25:51,836 --> 00:25:53,971
Let's start
with an easy question.

00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:56,440
Paige Rycoff was
a student of yours.

00:25:56,507 --> 00:25:58,309
Introduction to Philosophy, yes.

00:25:58,376 --> 00:26:00,077
Amanda...

00:26:00,144 --> 00:26:02,880
uh, I'll talk to you tomorrow
after class.

00:26:05,683 --> 00:26:07,918
WILLOWS:
Cute.

00:26:07,985 --> 00:26:10,521
Let me guess-- "C" student?

00:26:10,588 --> 00:26:12,623
Not if I can help it.

00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:16,123
and what kind of student was Paige?

00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:20,500
She was a very bright young woman.

00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:25,583
"Some circumstantial
evidence is very strong

00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,318
"as when you find a trout in the milk."

00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,474
Henry David Thoreau.

00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:33,344
But that's just broken pottery.

00:26:33,411 --> 00:26:36,080
My perception--

00:26:36,147 --> 00:26:39,317
sign of struggle.

00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:43,644
Okay, look,
it's been six days.

00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,345
If you have a legitimate reason

00:26:45,412 --> 00:26:47,381
for being outside of her dorm,
tell us.

00:26:47,447 --> 00:26:50,125
If you have
an illegitimate reason, tell us that.

00:26:50,528 --> 00:26:52,930
Tell us something,
so that we can move forward.

00:26:56,767 --> 00:27:00,504
Again, my perception--
silence confirms guilt.

00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:06,077
We found <i>you.</i> We will
find what you're hiding.

00:27:06,143 --> 00:27:08,179
I'm married.

00:27:08,245 --> 00:27:10,014
Yep. The ring indicates that.

00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:11,882
BRASS:
Your car's on the way
to the crime lab.

00:27:11,949 --> 00:27:13,584
We're going to need
to search your home.

00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:15,753
She was never in my car;
she was never in my house.

00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,921
Where <i>has</i> she been?

00:27:16,988 --> 00:27:20,391
Here. That's how the vase broke,
because we were...

00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:21,892
Physical.

00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:23,661
Amorous.

00:27:23,728 --> 00:27:25,529
Oh, so you cared
about her?

00:27:25,596 --> 00:27:27,198
But obviously not enough
to come forward.

00:27:27,264 --> 00:27:31,035
And tell you what?
That I cheat on my wife

00:27:31,102 --> 00:27:33,070
with my student
who is missing

00:27:33,137 --> 00:27:35,840
and I have absolutely
no information?

00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:38,109
If it was important enough
for you to hide

00:27:38,175 --> 00:27:40,211
it's important enough
for us to know.

00:27:42,313 --> 00:27:44,415
Any idea where she might be?
No. I...

00:27:44,482 --> 00:27:46,751
I went to the dorm.

00:27:46,817 --> 00:27:49,286
I-I did. I went to, I don't
know, maybe to stop her

00:27:49,353 --> 00:27:51,022
maybe to say good-bye
one last time

00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:53,257
but at the very least,
I wanted to see her.

00:27:54,692 --> 00:27:56,894
But she never came down.

00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:59,527
BRASS:
Let's take a ride in the black-and-white.

00:28:01,963 --> 00:28:04,298
Can I meet you there?

00:28:04,365 --> 00:28:05,603
I-I'm not going anywhere.

00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:10,941
I just need a little time
to explain all this to my wife.

00:28:11,008 --> 00:28:13,244
BRASS:
No, I understand.

00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,945
I'll send an officer with you,
just in case.

00:28:15,012 --> 00:28:17,648
Thank you.

00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:44,775
Medulla, cuticle and cortex
are a visual match

00:28:44,842 --> 00:28:47,611
to the hairs I pulled
from Paige Rycoff's brush.

00:28:47,678 --> 00:28:51,349
The roots have skin tags.

00:28:51,415 --> 00:28:53,651
Means hairs were ripped out.

00:28:53,718 --> 00:28:55,152
Ouch!

00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,490
Too bad this doesn't get us
any closer to finding Paige.

00:28:59,557 --> 00:29:01,726
She was in his car.

00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:04,128
It gets us closer
to our suspect.

00:29:05,542 --> 00:29:09,245
GRISSOM:
Let me remind you,
you have the right to counsel.

00:29:09,312 --> 00:29:10,947
I don't need counsel.

00:29:11,014 --> 00:29:12,803
The only person I was
hiding from was my wife.

00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,805
She knows everything now.

00:29:14,872 --> 00:29:16,707
So ask your questions.

00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:22,021
We found some of Paige's
hair in your car.

00:29:22,087 --> 00:29:24,375
Well, that's impossible
because she's never been in my car.

00:29:24,382 --> 00:29:26,183
Are you sure it was hers?

00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:29,120
You mean, uh, will it
stand up in court?

00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:30,454
Yes, it will.

00:29:30,521 --> 00:29:32,990
Well, maybe it was
on my sweater or something.

00:29:33,057 --> 00:29:34,325
Four strands of hair

00:29:34,392 --> 00:29:38,429
pulled out by the root,
on the passenger's headrest.

00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:44,301
How about this one?

00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:47,538
A phone call made from your
house to Paige's dorm room

00:29:47,605 --> 00:29:48,806
the day she disappeared.

00:29:48,873 --> 00:29:51,208
I only use my cell phone
when I call her--

00:29:51,275 --> 00:29:53,911
not my office, not my home.

00:29:53,978 --> 00:29:58,115
12:16 p.m., four minutes long.

00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:02,987
Faculty lunch

00:30:03,054 --> 00:30:06,390
that day, 12:00 to 2:00,
every department head.

00:30:06,457 --> 00:30:08,592
And it will stand up in court.

00:30:10,761 --> 00:30:14,065
Professor Woodbury,
does your wife work?

00:30:14,131 --> 00:30:15,733
No.

00:30:17,935 --> 00:30:20,438
No.

00:30:23,908 --> 00:30:26,277
BRASS:
So, are you home
during the day?

00:30:26,344 --> 00:30:28,446
Sometimes.
Were you home
around 12:00

00:30:28,512 --> 00:30:30,748
on the day that Paige
Rycoff disappeared?

00:30:30,815 --> 00:30:32,149
I don't remember.

00:30:32,216 --> 00:30:36,087
Sharon, someone called
Paige from the house,
and it wasn't me.

00:30:36,153 --> 00:30:38,589
Mrs. Woodbury

00:30:38,656 --> 00:30:40,424
do you have the keys
to your husband's car?

00:30:40,491 --> 00:30:43,094
We share it. It's <i>our</i> car.

00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,096
How long have you known?

00:30:45,162 --> 00:30:47,064
About this one
or all the others?

00:30:47,131 --> 00:30:49,867
I knew that she
was different.

00:30:49,934 --> 00:30:53,704
And I wasn't about to let some
kid walk away with my marriage

00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:56,707
so I called her up,
took her for a ride

00:30:56,774 --> 00:30:59,477
explained the facts of life
to her-- wife, three kids

00:30:59,543 --> 00:31:01,212
mortgage.

00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:04,849
She said it was over,
she was going home.

00:31:04,915 --> 00:31:07,752
Didn't say why; I didn't ask.

00:31:07,818 --> 00:31:11,255
Mrs. Woodbury, I think
you're leaving something out.

00:31:11,322 --> 00:31:15,259
They found Paige's hair
in the car

00:31:15,326 --> 00:31:17,628
and they think...

00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,832
Did you attack her?

00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:23,501
No.

00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:25,169
I wanted to.

00:31:25,236 --> 00:31:27,838
I almost did.

00:31:27,905 --> 00:31:29,840
<i>She went to get out of the car.</i>

00:31:29,907 --> 00:31:32,843
You are 18. What the hell
do you know about love?

00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,712
I don't need to take this.

00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:36,614
Ow!

00:31:37,915 --> 00:31:39,984
I stopped her.

00:31:40,051 --> 00:31:43,821
Apologized. We talked.

00:31:43,888 --> 00:31:45,656
And I dropped her off.

00:31:45,723 --> 00:31:46,857
( <i>cell phone rings</i> )

00:31:46,924 --> 00:31:48,959
Excuse me.
Yeah.

00:31:49,026 --> 00:31:51,629
Grissom.

00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:56,634
( <i>inaudible radio transmission)</i>

00:31:56,701 --> 00:31:58,169
So, is it her?

00:31:58,235 --> 00:32:00,271
I don't know. I just
got here myself.

00:32:00,338 --> 00:32:04,675
Some homeless guy
searching for hidden
treasure finds a body.

00:32:04,742 --> 00:32:06,344
P.D.'s here on the scene.

00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,346
We got first looks.

00:32:34,438 --> 00:32:37,008
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:32:37,074 --> 00:32:39,677
Yeah.

00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,934
I've seen things
like this before.

00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:45,744
When I worked in Arlington,
Virginia, every winter

00:32:45,811 --> 00:32:49,083
homeless trying to stay warm
take a nap in a Dumpster

00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:51,719
wake up in a garbage
compactor. Mulch.

00:32:51,786 --> 00:32:54,622
Warrick and I searched the
trash chute at the dorm.

00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:57,692
It was clean. There was no
reason to check the Dumpster.

00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:59,227
GRISSOM:
So you're saying

00:32:59,293 --> 00:33:02,130
she was killed
by the compactor.
Crushed to death.

00:33:02,196 --> 00:33:03,765
No, she was crushed postmortem.

00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:05,900
And you know this how?

00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:09,570
Tissue in the extremities

00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:11,672
was yellow and dry.

00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,474
Means blood wasn't pumping

00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:15,209
through her veins

00:33:15,276 --> 00:33:17,478
when she went
through that compactor.

00:33:17,545 --> 00:33:18,946
So what did kill her?

00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:22,483
Massive internal bleeding.
Her spleen ruptured.

00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,718
From what?

00:33:23,785 --> 00:33:25,253
Blunt-force trauma.

00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:27,121
Point of impact?

00:33:27,188 --> 00:33:28,456
Rib cage.

00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:32,260
Ribs weren't crushed.
They sustained a single blow.

00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:35,496
Type of weapon?

00:33:35,563 --> 00:33:36,597
I have no idea.

00:33:36,664 --> 00:33:38,266
I'm still trying
to straighten her out.

00:33:38,332 --> 00:33:39,834
Truth? I may never know.

00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:42,437
Now what?

00:33:42,503 --> 00:33:45,006
Well, you followed the lead,
it went cold.

00:33:45,073 --> 00:33:46,541
Now it's hot again.

00:33:56,684 --> 00:33:59,354
I found some blood.

00:34:03,324 --> 00:34:04,659
WILLOWS:
Yeah.

00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:06,260
Not much, but enough
to work with.

00:34:06,327 --> 00:34:07,929
GRISSOM:
Okay.

00:34:07,995 --> 00:34:09,697
Photograph it, swab it.

00:34:09,764 --> 00:34:10,865
Let's get it
back to the lab.

00:34:10,932 --> 00:34:12,100
If it's hers,
maybe that's why

00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:13,634
the scent dogs lost their trail.

00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:15,503
The odor from the
Dumpster would've...

00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:16,938
thrown them off.

00:34:17,004 --> 00:34:18,773
I think I got something here.
Check this out.

00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,875
The whole Dumpster's
beat to hell.

00:34:20,942 --> 00:34:22,977
This one spot's fresh.

00:34:27,715 --> 00:34:29,617
Nick's right--
the vehicle paint chips

00:34:29,684 --> 00:34:31,152
metal flecks
in the color coat.

00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:33,187
There's some matching
chips on the ground.

00:34:33,254 --> 00:34:35,890
Still, there's no reason
to think there's a connection

00:34:35,957 --> 00:34:38,559
between the paint transfer
and Paige.

00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:40,161
No reason to think there's not.

00:34:40,228 --> 00:34:42,296
STOKES:
Possibly a
hit-and-run?

00:34:42,363 --> 00:34:45,400
Means the vehicle had a high
ground clearance. Maybe an SUV?

00:34:45,466 --> 00:34:48,936
It would explain
the blunt-force trauma.

00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:52,940
Point of impact was her abdomen.

00:34:55,076 --> 00:34:56,844
( <i>tires screeching</i> )

00:34:58,613 --> 00:35:00,882
( <i>thudding</i> )

00:35:00,948 --> 00:35:03,818
Driver tossed her in
the Dumpster to hide his crime.

00:35:03,885 --> 00:35:05,753
Or <i>her</i> crime.

00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,822
Mrs. Woodbury.

00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:09,023
She's still a viable suspect.

00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,625
But with a silver car.

00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,593
SIDLE:
She could have rented

00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,228
borrowed from a friend.

00:35:14,295 --> 00:35:15,997
Still, why was Paige
even down here?

00:35:16,064 --> 00:35:17,765
GRISSOM:
Look, let's stick
to the how--

00:35:17,832 --> 00:35:19,867
we'll deal with the why later.

00:35:21,235 --> 00:35:24,439
The car that impacted
the Dumpster was
originally white

00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:26,774
then painted red,
and now it's black.

00:35:26,841 --> 00:35:29,444
There's two coats of primer
between each paint job.

00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,713
Quality work--
probably a dealership.

00:35:31,779 --> 00:35:34,682
Every paint has a unique
light absorption rate.

00:35:34,749 --> 00:35:36,884
We I.D. the paint,
we get to the car.

00:35:36,951 --> 00:35:38,586
Really?

00:35:40,588 --> 00:35:42,690
Cherokee, '89 or '90.

00:35:42,757 --> 00:35:45,760
Three paint jobs,
all factory stock.

00:35:45,827 --> 00:35:47,095
Stone white, flame red

00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:50,264
and there's your
midnight black there.

00:35:50,331 --> 00:35:52,166
Well, this narrows
our scope.

00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,401
Call Brass.

00:35:53,468 --> 00:35:54,569
Done.

00:35:54,635 --> 00:35:56,371
An hour ago.

00:36:00,441 --> 00:36:01,743
Where you been?

00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:03,344
I can't be everywhere,
Warrick

00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,046
and they banned human cloning.

00:36:05,113 --> 00:36:06,414
I just left Sanders.

00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:10,184
The blood from the Dumpster
matches Paige.

00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,553
Hey. Brass just called.
He's down at P.D.

00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,322
Paint to car; car to driver.

00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:17,291
Suspect's down there--
he's looking for you.

00:36:24,198 --> 00:36:25,733
Expectant father.

00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,170
My wife's pregnant.
Almost nine months.

00:36:29,237 --> 00:36:31,139
She beeped me.

00:36:31,205 --> 00:36:32,940
I was trying to get home.

00:36:33,007 --> 00:36:34,976
Couldn't believe the traffic.

00:36:35,043 --> 00:36:36,978
You always drive
through campus?

00:36:37,045 --> 00:36:39,447
We live on the other side
of Fraternity Row.

00:36:39,514 --> 00:36:41,449
It's a straight shot
from my office

00:36:41,516 --> 00:36:44,786
but I get to the freshman dorm,
nothing's moving.

00:36:44,852 --> 00:36:46,287
What time is this?

00:36:46,354 --> 00:36:47,822
Around 8:30, I guess.

00:36:49,524 --> 00:36:53,094
So you took a shortcut?

00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:55,029
Yeah, I thought
I was having a baby

00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:56,764
so I gunned it down the alley.

00:36:56,831 --> 00:36:58,132
Then what happened?

00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:01,302
I veered to avoid
the parked van.

00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:05,306
It was wet...
and I swiped the Dumpster.

00:37:05,373 --> 00:37:09,410
( <i>tires screeching, thudding)</i>

00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:14,349
If I had hit a car,
I would've stopped.

00:37:14,415 --> 00:37:17,885
It... it was just a Dumpster.

00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:21,356
Paint transfer's green,
just like the Dumpster.

00:37:21,422 --> 00:37:24,125
Doesn't mean
he didn't also hit a body.

00:37:24,192 --> 00:37:27,061
We have sprayed,
U.V.'d--

00:37:27,128 --> 00:37:30,298
no hair, no fibers,
no blood anywhere.

00:37:30,365 --> 00:37:33,735
It was a clean strike
against the Dumpster.

00:37:34,635 --> 00:37:36,371
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:37:36,437 --> 00:37:39,173
Your guy didn't hit Paige.

00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,276
And we've chased another lead
to a dead end.

00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,879
We still have
Mrs. Woodbury.

00:37:44,946 --> 00:37:45,947
Or her husband.

00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,682
WARRICK:
Oh, we've got
tons of motives.

00:37:47,749 --> 00:37:50,985
Not a stitch of evidence.

00:37:51,052 --> 00:37:52,520
GRISSOM:
H.L. Mencken
once said

00:37:52,587 --> 00:37:56,024
"There's an easy solution
to every human problem--

00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,860
neat, plausible... and wrong."

00:37:58,926 --> 00:38:01,763
So if the solution
to our problem

00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:03,898
is not neat

00:38:03,965 --> 00:38:05,800
plausible and wrong

00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:10,471
then it could be messy,
unlikely and right.

00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,106
Right?

00:38:13,841 --> 00:38:15,410
A butterfly flaps its wings
in Brazil

00:38:15,476 --> 00:38:17,412
we get a hurricane
off the coast of Florida.

00:38:17,478 --> 00:38:19,781
Chaos theory.
Here we go.

00:38:19,847 --> 00:38:22,350
Random events;
the wholesale rejection

00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:23,718
of linear thought.

00:38:23,785 --> 00:38:25,887
Physics meets philosophy.

00:38:25,953 --> 00:38:27,922
If we apply it
to Paige Rycoff
and our case

00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:29,924
at this particular moment
in time

00:38:29,991 --> 00:38:33,561
then we can say
life is unpredictable.

00:38:33,628 --> 00:38:37,098
No one can predict more than
a few seconds into the future.

00:38:37,165 --> 00:38:39,967
I predict I'll still be standing
here one minute from now.

00:38:40,034 --> 00:38:41,869
Where are we going
with this?

00:38:41,936 --> 00:38:43,171
Paige was in her dorm room

00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,639
and then ended up
in the Dumpster.

00:38:44,706 --> 00:38:47,442
Somewhere between her dorm room
and the Dumpster is our answer.

00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:48,876
That's where we're going.

00:38:48,943 --> 00:38:50,478
Coming, Nick?

00:38:51,646 --> 00:38:54,315
WARRICK:
Nice try,
Nostradamus.

00:38:57,685 --> 00:38:59,987
Look out the window.

00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,492
What do you see?

00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:11,432
Traffic. My cab
is waiting for me.

00:39:11,499 --> 00:39:13,067
So what do you do next?

00:39:13,134 --> 00:39:14,669
Grab my suitcases...

00:39:14,736 --> 00:39:16,137
get out of town.

00:39:17,472 --> 00:39:18,940
Stop.

00:39:19,006 --> 00:39:20,908
Suitcases never left the room.

00:39:20,975 --> 00:39:22,777
You didn't take them with.

00:39:24,145 --> 00:39:26,280
I've been cleaning all day.

00:39:26,347 --> 00:39:28,516
Because you want
your security deposit back.

00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:31,619
Yeah, I have to leave the room
exactly like I found it.

00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:36,257
So what's missing?

00:39:36,324 --> 00:39:38,626
Two box springs,
two mattresses

00:39:38,693 --> 00:39:41,496
two desks... two
lamps, two chairs

00:39:41,562 --> 00:39:44,165
two dressers.

00:39:45,533 --> 00:39:47,201
Trash can?

00:39:50,104 --> 00:39:52,040
And it's missing.

00:39:52,106 --> 00:39:55,176
What's the last thing you do
after you've done the cleaning?

00:39:55,243 --> 00:39:57,078
Take out the trash.

00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:05,853
Hi. Could I borrow
your trash can?

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,824
Paige dumps the trash,
goes back to her room.

00:40:09,891 --> 00:40:12,126
How does she end up
in the Dumpster?

00:40:12,193 --> 00:40:13,895
You're thinking too linear.

00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:16,698
Chaos theory, remember?
Just dump it.

00:40:16,764 --> 00:40:18,032
Okay.

00:40:23,104 --> 00:40:24,372
Whoa.

00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:26,307
Almost took my hand off.

00:40:26,374 --> 00:40:28,743
Maybe you're quicker
than Paige was.

00:40:30,445 --> 00:40:31,479
Excuse me.

00:40:31,546 --> 00:40:33,247
Could you do
me a favor?

00:40:33,314 --> 00:40:34,849
We're doing a
little experiment.

00:40:34,916 --> 00:40:36,284
Could you count
to a hundred

00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,820
and then drop this
can all the way
down the chute?

00:40:38,886 --> 00:40:40,321
Thanks.

00:40:40,388 --> 00:40:42,457
Watch your fingers.

00:40:46,661 --> 00:40:49,664
( <i>clanging</i> )

00:40:49,731 --> 00:40:52,633
What the hell is going on?

00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,969
There was a busted spring
in the chute.

00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,505
Oh, yeah, I had
to prop that open

00:40:57,572 --> 00:41:00,441
when Catherine
rappelled down.

00:41:00,508 --> 00:41:02,410
Relevance?

00:41:02,477 --> 00:41:05,246
The trash can was missing
from Paige's room.

00:41:05,313 --> 00:41:08,583
You're thinking she
accidentally dropped
it down the chute.

00:41:08,649 --> 00:41:10,885
Then how did she end
up in the Dumpster?

00:41:10,952 --> 00:41:13,354
SIDLE:
She wanted her
security deposit back.

00:41:13,421 --> 00:41:16,224
And there's no
easy access here.

00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:19,894
Right, so... she
had to improvise.

00:41:21,596 --> 00:41:24,032
Excuse me.
Oh. Please.

00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:28,970
This actually happened to me
once before, with a set of keys.

00:41:29,037 --> 00:41:31,773
Eddie and I had
this huge blowout.

00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,708
He threw my keys in the trash.

00:41:33,775 --> 00:41:36,911
All right, so Paige...
leans over

00:41:36,978 --> 00:41:38,646
reaches for the trash can.

00:41:38,713 --> 00:41:42,617
But just then,
here comes Mark Doyle.

00:42:02,203 --> 00:42:03,471
( <i>thudding</i> )

00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:16,617
Let me get this straight.

00:42:16,684 --> 00:42:20,154
You're-you're saying a
confluence of unrelated,
unfortunate events

00:42:20,221 --> 00:42:23,224
conspired... to
kill my daughter.

00:42:24,592 --> 00:42:25,593
Yes.

00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,694
No, no, no.

00:42:26,761 --> 00:42:28,296
<i>Somebody</i> is responsible.

00:42:28,363 --> 00:42:29,764
Mrs. Rycoff

00:42:29,831 --> 00:42:31,766
there is no one

00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:33,601
guilty of this.

00:42:33,668 --> 00:42:36,537
Because you say so?

00:42:36,604 --> 00:42:38,506
Because the evidence says so.

00:42:38,573 --> 00:42:41,109
We'll hire an investigator,
as many as necessary.

00:42:41,175 --> 00:42:42,310
Someone killed Paige

00:42:42,377 --> 00:42:43,945
and my wife and I
won't rest

00:42:44,012 --> 00:42:46,147
until every question
is answered.

00:42:50,351 --> 00:42:52,520
We told them what happened.

00:42:52,587 --> 00:42:55,256
Yeah, but we didn't give them
what they needed--

00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:56,991
some closure.

00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,162
Truth brings closure.

00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,792
Not always.
