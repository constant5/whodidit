00:00:46,843 --> 00:00:49,078
We should have
these parties more
than once a month.

00:00:49,145 --> 00:00:51,180
I would, but Mina
tends to get jealous.

00:00:51,247 --> 00:00:52,682
I love you, Chief

00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:56,319
but if anybody should
be jealous, it's you.

00:00:56,386 --> 00:00:58,187
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:00:59,856 --> 00:01:01,057
Who's that guy?

00:01:01,124 --> 00:01:01,750
Hey, Chief...

00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,518
I didn't know
you were into guys.

00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:05,743
What guy?

00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:46,417
( <i>two gunshots</i> )

00:01:51,856 --> 00:01:53,091
Daddy?

00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:18,236
So two nights ago
he has a party.

00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:20,605
High-end guest list,
very private.

00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:22,908
That was the last
anyone saw of him.

00:02:22,974 --> 00:02:26,111
Housekeeper arrives
20 minutes ago.

00:02:26,178 --> 00:02:27,679
This is what she found.

00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:39,391
Ex-Chief of Detectives.

00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,893
Left to make the big bucks.

00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,164
Consultant with security
at every major casino in town

00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:48,233
and couldn't even
protect himself.

00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,670
There's only one interpretation
for this:

00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:54,539
"Kill the pig."

00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:58,310
And what about
the rest of his family?

00:02:58,376 --> 00:03:00,178
No sign of the wife.

00:03:00,245 --> 00:03:01,880
What about the daughter?

00:03:01,947 --> 00:03:03,849
Housekeeper assumed
that she spent the weekend

00:03:03,915 --> 00:03:04,916
with the grandmother.

00:03:04,983 --> 00:03:06,017
Assumed?

00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:30,242
She's gone.

His wife and daughter
are missing.

00:04:05,243 --> 00:04:08,513
His silver Cadillac DTS
is also missing.

00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,350
We're looking for any
signs of forced entry
in the house.

00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,584
Any signs of ransack

00:04:12,651 --> 00:04:15,153
that's not associated
with the party.
Okay.

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,355
We need serious damage control.

00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:17,622
When the media gets a hold of it

00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:19,324
it's going to be bad
for morale all around.

00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:20,826
Watch your step.

00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:21,893
I'll take the downstairs.

00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,495
Yeah, I'll be above you.

00:04:23,562 --> 00:04:25,630
Looks execution-style.

00:04:25,697 --> 00:04:27,599
At least one shot
to the back of the head.

00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:30,335
A lot of bruising
around these handcuffs.

00:04:30,402 --> 00:04:32,771
So he probably
fought back.

00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:34,539
Without a doubt.

00:04:34,606 --> 00:04:36,541
Found a shell casing.

00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:41,446
Looks like one of ours.

00:04:41,513 --> 00:04:45,183
Nine-millimeter.
Standard issue.

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,487
So where do you suppose
the Chief keeps his gun safe?

00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:50,222
( <i>drilling</i> )

00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:11,877
We're in.

00:05:15,747 --> 00:05:17,449
Thank you, Scott.

00:05:18,984 --> 00:05:21,286
What do you got?

00:05:24,756 --> 00:05:27,092
.38.

00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:29,895
Nice.

00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:32,064
Pearl handle .25.

00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,065
Clear?

00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:34,299
Still looking for that .9.

00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:46,178
So you think the
Chief might've kept

00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:48,347
his signature piece
someplace else?

00:05:48,413 --> 00:05:51,616
"For 25 years of
distinguished service."

00:05:51,683 --> 00:05:56,855
An honor like that.
Keep it in the case.

00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:58,123
Yeah.

00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,525
So I'm thinking that
the wife might be in on this.

00:06:00,592 --> 00:06:01,693
Why didn't
she plan better?

00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,628
Pack the kid's clothes.
What?

00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:05,597
The nanny told me that
she only took one shirt--

00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:06,965
one the kid
wouldn't even wear.

00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:08,333
Security guard.

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,768
No party list

00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:11,169
but he did see
each car that left

00:06:11,236 --> 00:06:12,671
the night of the
party and morning.

00:06:12,738 --> 00:06:15,374
Chief Rittle left
around 5:00 a.m.

00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:18,110
5:14 to be exact.

00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:24,116
You saw Chief Rittle leave?

00:06:24,182 --> 00:06:25,717
Yeah, he was with
his wife and kid.

00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:28,253
And he had his baseball cap
and sunglasses on

00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,721
like always does.

00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:32,324
So you saw a baseball cap
and sunglasses.
( <i>cell phone rings</i> )

00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,126
Did you actually
see the Chief's face?

00:06:34,192 --> 00:06:36,028
Grissom.
Well...

00:06:36,094 --> 00:06:37,429
Actually, I didn't.

00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:40,866
Brass found the
Chief's Cadillac.

00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:42,200
Who found it?

00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:44,603
In-house security.
Blue jacket.

00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,805
First time he saw
the car was Saturday.

00:06:46,872 --> 00:06:48,607
Chalked the tires twice.

00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:51,209
Saw the bulletin on
the Chief and called us.

00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:52,678
Any bodies, Joe?

00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:54,980
I already checked
inside the car.

00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,115
We're waiting on you
to check the trunk.

00:07:00,852 --> 00:07:02,287
( <i>cell phone rings</i> )

00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:03,655
Whoa.

00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:05,357
Excuse me.

00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,225
Who is this?

00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:16,802
"Chief Rittle"?

00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:19,638
What is his connection
to the Chief?

00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:20,839
I don't know.

00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:23,108
But if he has gunpowder
residue on him

00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:24,910
could be our shooter.

00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,478
Okay.

00:07:26,545 --> 00:07:29,014
Florida Highway Patrol called.

00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,583
Several motorists
saw a girl

00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,685
matching Sasha's exact
physical description

00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:35,187
walking along an access road.

00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:36,288
In Florida?

00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:37,622
Miami-Dade County.

00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:39,524
Chief was shot Friday night.

00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:41,360
It's a two-day drive
if you don't stop.

00:07:41,426 --> 00:07:43,195
It's national news

00:07:43,261 --> 00:07:44,763
with national attention.

00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,598
I'm not surprised
we're getting call-ins.

00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:48,100
Well, if it is our little girl

00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,602
she's got evidence on her
from two Vegas homicides.

00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:52,304
One of us should be down there

00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,573
to process.

00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,345
Take Warrick.
I don't think he's
ever been to Florida.

00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:10,489
( <i>sirens blaring</i> )

00:08:10,555 --> 00:08:12,024
She's seven years old!

00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,192
She's wearing a pink shirt!

00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:17,462
She was last seen
by a motorist there!

00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:20,499
She can be two kilometers
in either direction.

00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:23,168
Think of this area
as a quadrant. Divide up.

00:08:23,235 --> 00:08:24,803
You, north.
Got it!

00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,271
You, south.

00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:27,439
All right, this way.

00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:28,774
Let's go.

( <i>horn blowing</i> )

00:08:30,642 --> 00:08:31,710
Clear out!

00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:32,811
Watch your back!

00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:03,842
( <i>squeals</i> )

00:09:07,112 --> 00:09:09,314
( <i>squealing</i> )

00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,585
Sasha?

00:09:53,522 --> 00:09:55,057
Sasha.

00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:58,794
My name is Horatio Caine.

00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:00,542
I'm the head of the Crime Unit.

00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,009
Horatio?

00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:03,344
Yeah.

00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,312
That's a funny name,
isn't it?

00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:07,281
My mother named me

00:10:07,348 --> 00:10:10,017
after a famous writer
named Horatio Alger.

00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:11,852
Ever hear of him?

00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,620
Is your badge real?

00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:15,222
Yeah.

00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:17,591
Yeah, that's real.

00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:23,097
My daddy's a policeman.

00:10:23,163 --> 00:10:26,133
I know that.

00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,401
I knew that.

00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:32,406
They're looking for me,
you know.

00:10:32,473 --> 00:10:36,043
Me, too. Me, too.

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:40,714
What do you say we sit here
and get found together?

00:10:51,158 --> 00:10:52,359
What a day.

00:10:58,417 --> 00:11:01,086
( <i>helicopter whirring</i> )

00:11:01,153 --> 00:11:03,388
Burgundy sedan.
Caucasian female.

00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,857
Age 32. Traveling
with a Caucasian male

00:11:05,924 --> 00:11:07,059
indeterminate age.

00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,660
I got a female in distress.

00:11:08,727 --> 00:11:11,096
I want the APB to
extend the whole state.

00:11:11,163 --> 00:11:12,792
Panhandle to the Keys, yes, sir.

00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:13,793
Good.

00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,135
Horatio Caine.

00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:31,136
Catherine Willows.

00:11:31,202 --> 00:11:32,137
Caine.
Brown.

00:11:32,203 --> 00:11:34,039
Child Services has
sent a doctor out.

00:11:34,105 --> 00:11:35,673
All right,
let's just be clear.

00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,941
This is a Las Vegas case.

00:11:37,008 --> 00:11:39,210
This is our victim
and we do the processing.

00:11:39,277 --> 00:11:40,812
Okay, I didn't say
he processed her.

00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:41,946
I just said he was here.

00:11:42,013 --> 00:11:43,615
I appreciate the respect.

00:11:43,682 --> 00:11:45,150
You sure about that?

00:11:45,216 --> 00:11:46,618
Does she know about her father?

00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:47,667
Not yet.

00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:49,369
Well, I'd like to get started
processing.

00:11:49,436 --> 00:11:50,704
Can you show me
who you found?

00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,439
Okay, I found her
right in here. And...

00:11:52,505 --> 00:11:54,808
this is the young lady
right over here.

00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,786
Hi, Sasha.

00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:02,320
I'm Catherine Willows.

00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:04,156
And...

00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:07,225
I need to ask you
a few questions.

00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:08,693
Okay?

00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,664
My kit.

00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,199
Did the man touch you?

00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,868
He hit my mommy.

00:12:20,305 --> 00:12:22,374
Did he hit you?

00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,342
Did he hurt you
in any way?

00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:27,112
He acted like
I wasn't there.

00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:31,383
Well, you know what
always happens to
bad people?

00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,418
They leave behind
a part of themselves

00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:36,922
and that's how you can
help us find your mommy.

00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:38,724
Now, I need to look

00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,125
underneath your fingernails.

00:12:45,263 --> 00:12:48,500
You want to show me
what's in your hand?

00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:51,403
It's okay.

00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,312
Where did you get that?

00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,316
Go! Run, Sasha, run!

00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:09,321
I ran out after they drove off.

00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,226
I picked that up.

00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:16,128
I bet it felt cold
when you picked it up.

00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:19,364
No.

00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,099
No... hot.

00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,435
Hmm.

00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:24,936
You're tricking me.

00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:27,105
You're too smart for that.

00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,610
You can spot a Glock cartridge
from a block away:

00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:33,412
rectangular
firing pin impression

00:13:33,478 --> 00:13:35,080
breach face shear.

00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,114
This casing's no Glock.

00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:37,282
It's isn't your Chief's weapon.

00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,618
Well, whoever this guy
is, he's a lousy shot.

00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:40,986
Five casings, no hits.

00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,321
Oh, by the way,
I'm Calleigh Duquesne.

00:13:43,388 --> 00:13:45,757
Don't ask me how to spell it.
Southern.

00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,060
Catherine Willows.
Southern... Nevada.

00:13:48,126 --> 00:13:49,394
You got a theory on how

00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:50,595
the mother and daughter
ended up

00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:51,997
all the way in Miami
from Las Vegas?

00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:53,932
Well, we don't actually
work theories.

00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:54,933
Do we, Warrick?

00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,601
No, just evidence.

00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:59,237
We're much more
fanciful down here.

00:13:59,304 --> 00:14:00,238
Aren't we, Horatio?

00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:01,807
I think that's a
fair description.

00:14:01,873 --> 00:14:04,342
My guess is, this belongs
to Taurus 9, made in Brazil.

00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:05,944
It's a cheap
Beretta knockoff

00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,246
and you may not see
many of them in Vegas

00:14:08,313 --> 00:14:10,449
but we get them down here
all the time.

00:14:10,515 --> 00:14:13,585
Which makes me think this guy
wasn't fleeing Las Vegas.

00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,954
He was coming home to Miami.

00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,023
Well, it's no longer
"Trunk Man."

00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,525
Identified him
from his dental records.

00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:23,095
Jason Doyle. Dead
for three days; no GSR.

00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,419
So, I guess he
didn't shoot Rittle.

00:14:26,486 --> 00:14:28,792
We only recovered one
slug from his cranium.

00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:30,527
And I got this fragment

00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:32,028
from his lower back.

00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,326
His lower back?

00:14:34,392 --> 00:14:37,262
I thought he was shot
twice in the head.

00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:38,830
Vascular embolization.

00:14:38,897 --> 00:14:40,583
Bullet got into his
arterial system.

00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,518
That's rare.

00:14:41,584 --> 00:14:43,586
Well, it took a
full-body x-ray

00:14:43,653 --> 00:14:45,522
for me to find the thing.

00:14:45,588 --> 00:14:47,023
Bullet entered here

00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:50,226
fragmenting at the neck

00:14:50,293 --> 00:14:52,295
<i>and losing velocity</i>
<i>upon penetration</i>

00:14:52,362 --> 00:14:54,464
of the carotid artery.

00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:57,500
Tube down the aorta,
continually losing momentum.

00:14:57,567 --> 00:15:01,104
<i>As it exited the aorta,</i>
<i>it struck the vertebral column</i>

00:15:01,171 --> 00:15:03,840
<i>and then was swept down</i>
<i>to the base of the aorta</i>

00:15:03,907 --> 00:15:05,625
where I recovered it
here at the lumbar region.

00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:06,960
( <i>huffs</i> )

00:15:07,027 --> 00:15:08,028
Pinball.

00:15:09,162 --> 00:15:11,565
Looks like nines,
like we found in the Chief.

00:15:11,631 --> 00:15:13,542
I'll call Catherine. Thanks.

00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:14,543
Yeah.

00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:19,514
Hey, Nick...

00:15:19,581 --> 00:15:20,515
Mm-hmm?

00:15:20,582 --> 00:15:22,951
You ever been
to a swingers' party?

00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:25,554
Well, if it's the same
thing as a frat party

00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,721
yeah, lots of them.

00:15:26,788 --> 00:15:28,823
You know, you get
enough booze going

00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,492
things can get pretty wild.

00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,160
Frat party, huh?

00:15:32,227 --> 00:15:35,897
I wouldn't know
anything about that.

00:15:39,467 --> 00:15:41,002
How wild?

00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,583
Multiple-partner wild.

00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,284
And it'd be no big deal

00:15:46,351 --> 00:15:49,721
to have two, maybe three
girls at once, just...

00:15:49,788 --> 00:15:51,389
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:15:51,456 --> 00:15:54,159
Hit on the rock glass.

00:15:54,226 --> 00:15:55,041
"Work card.

00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,844
Orpheus Hotel. Tiffany Langer."

00:15:57,911 --> 00:15:59,212
Who's she?

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,914
Showgirl.

00:16:02,382 --> 00:16:04,217
Yes, I went to the party.

00:16:04,284 --> 00:16:05,886
No, I didn't go alone.

00:16:05,952 --> 00:16:07,954
And no, I'm not telling you

00:16:08,021 --> 00:16:10,223
my date's name
or anyone else who was there.

00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,092
These people are important.

00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:15,362
Well, a very important
police officer

00:16:15,428 --> 00:16:17,097
was murdered there.

00:16:17,164 --> 00:16:18,298
I don't care.

00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:20,901
It took me a long time
to get into the circle

00:16:20,967 --> 00:16:22,502
and I plan on
staying there.

00:16:22,569 --> 00:16:24,838
Was there anybody there
you didn't know?

00:16:24,905 --> 00:16:26,540
Anybody who wasn't
in "the circle"?

00:16:26,606 --> 00:16:28,742
Well, my date.

00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:30,043
Do you know where he is?

00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,345
I haven't seen him
since that night.

00:16:32,412 --> 00:16:35,048
He sent me home
with a judge and his wife.

00:16:35,115 --> 00:16:37,083
So... your date

00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,885
stayed at the party
after you left?

00:16:38,952 --> 00:16:40,987
As far as I know.

00:16:41,054 --> 00:16:42,689
Where does he live?

00:16:42,756 --> 00:16:43,690
I don't know.

00:16:43,757 --> 00:16:44,991
I've known him for five days.

00:16:45,058 --> 00:16:47,360
GRISSOM:
Well, that's 120 hours.

00:16:47,427 --> 00:16:49,229
There must be something
you know about him

00:16:49,296 --> 00:16:50,597
that you could share with us.

00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:55,068
Right-handed, a Libra,
circumcised, rich...

00:16:55,135 --> 00:16:57,137
Back-East rich.

00:16:57,204 --> 00:16:58,238
Which kind of surprised me

00:16:58,305 --> 00:16:59,873
because he wore
really cheap cologne.

00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,243
Cheap? How?

00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:06,179
Smelled funny... sweet.

00:17:06,246 --> 00:17:07,547
Are you sure it was cologne?

00:17:07,614 --> 00:17:08,548
Or deodorant.

00:17:08,615 --> 00:17:10,183
Mouthwash maybe.

00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,686
All I know is
it smelled sickly sweet.

00:17:12,752 --> 00:17:16,389
To be honest I thought he could
have used a little help

00:17:16,456 --> 00:17:17,958
in that department.

00:17:18,024 --> 00:17:19,426
Would you happen to have

00:17:19,493 --> 00:17:22,062
an article of clothing
of his by any chance?

00:17:22,129 --> 00:17:24,764
The only thing he gave me
was a good time.

00:17:24,831 --> 00:17:25,832
Hey, guess what?

00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:27,417
This isn't about you.

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,602
This is about a missing
seven-year-old girl.

00:17:33,305 --> 00:17:35,607
Why don't you give us his name.

00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:41,813
Adam Van der Welk.

00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,516
Uh, no, the Chief's little girl
is with Child Services.

00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,185
We're still
at the drop-off place.

00:17:47,252 --> 00:17:48,186
Yeah, right.

00:17:48,253 --> 00:17:49,454
Will do, Brass.

00:17:49,521 --> 00:17:50,589
I got a pill.

00:17:50,656 --> 00:17:52,991
Looks like sedative.

00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:58,030
Okay.

00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:01,291
Diazapam.

00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,593
Benzos...

00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:04,094
That could explain
why the mother

00:18:04,161 --> 00:18:05,208
didn't escape
with her daughter.

00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,543
She was incapacitated.

00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:09,579
Go!

00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,959
How'd the little girl get away?

00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,166
We got some tire treads
on the shoulder.

00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,250
Made an easy stop.

00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,187
And why did he pick
such a secluded area?

00:18:20,253 --> 00:18:22,689
Seems like a great place
to ice someone.

00:18:22,756 --> 00:18:24,124
Or take a leak.

00:18:24,191 --> 00:18:27,394
Maybe that's why he stopped
the car here... to take a leak.

00:18:30,197 --> 00:18:32,766
Run! Run, Sash, run!

00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,001
Let me ask you another question:

00:18:35,068 --> 00:18:36,603
When you're home alone

00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,305
do you lock the bathroom door?

00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:39,706
I don't even know you.

00:18:39,773 --> 00:18:40,707
Sure you do.

00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:41,875
We all do.

00:18:41,942 --> 00:18:44,611
It's human nature to avoid
being vulnerable, isn't it?

00:18:44,678 --> 00:18:46,146
So, if that's the case

00:18:46,213 --> 00:18:48,782
then he would look for a tree

00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:51,384
to shield himself, wouldn't he?

00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:55,122
So, then the question becomes

00:18:55,188 --> 00:18:58,792
how far along this path
before he loses sight of them?

00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:00,961
Not very far.

00:19:01,027 --> 00:19:02,162
Look at this.

00:19:02,229 --> 00:19:03,463
Bang. Footprints...

00:19:05,198 --> 00:19:07,968
and this is urine.

00:19:11,338 --> 00:19:14,007
If you're lucky urethral cells
with slough off with urine.

00:19:15,075 --> 00:19:18,445
But if we get his DNA

00:19:18,512 --> 00:19:20,180
there's a chance we'll get him.

00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:21,448
( <i>cell phone rings</i> )

00:19:21,515 --> 00:19:23,183
Yeah. Caine.

00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,851
What do you mean FBI?

00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:30,690
WILLOWS:
So you're saying

00:19:30,757 --> 00:19:31,992
the guy has B.O.?

00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:34,428
GRISSOM:
Body odor, bad breath.

00:19:34,494 --> 00:19:36,496
I don't know; there's something
about Adam Van der Welk

00:19:36,563 --> 00:19:37,798
that makes him smell.

00:19:37,864 --> 00:19:41,368
All this because some showgirl
said he smelled sweet?

00:19:41,435 --> 00:19:42,369
Sickly sweet.

00:19:42,436 --> 00:19:44,805
Smells can be like fingerprints,
my dear.

00:19:44,871 --> 00:19:46,473
Hey, what's going on there?

00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,775
I thought you were meeting
the Feds?

00:19:48,842 --> 00:19:50,744
Uh, yeah, we are.
They picked the place.

00:19:50,811 --> 00:19:51,745
The Shore Club.

00:19:51,812 --> 00:19:53,613
Later.

00:19:54,815 --> 00:19:56,316
What's taking so long?

00:19:56,383 --> 00:19:58,151
That is a good question.

00:20:00,887 --> 00:20:02,989
Hey, I just ran into
a Fed in the lobby.

00:20:03,056 --> 00:20:05,125
He told me that

00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:08,662
apparently the Vegas case
fits the profile of a serial

00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:10,097
the FBI's been tracking.

00:20:10,163 --> 00:20:11,932
Hey, you're from Vegas?

00:20:11,998 --> 00:20:12,866
Speedle.
Brown.

00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:14,267
Where was the Fed?

00:20:14,334 --> 00:20:15,669
He's right there
in the lobby.

00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:17,204
He's got his
little headphone on

00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,205
and his little tie.

00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:19,473
And you talked to him?

00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:20,807
Yeah.

00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:22,175
Do they have an ID yet?

00:20:22,242 --> 00:20:23,610
No ID yet,
but their perp

00:20:23,677 --> 00:20:25,312
targets wealthy couples

00:20:25,378 --> 00:20:27,647
at their playgrounds...

00:20:27,714 --> 00:20:31,017
Pebble Beach, Aspen,
the Hamptons.

00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:33,220
Evidently the husbands
get murdered first

00:20:33,286 --> 00:20:35,355
and the wives later.

00:20:35,422 --> 00:20:38,658
After they've enjoyed 48 hours
of fun and games.

00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:39,826
48?

00:20:39,893 --> 00:20:41,027
Vegas?

00:20:41,094 --> 00:20:42,896
Speedle.
Willows.

00:20:44,097 --> 00:20:45,232
That's it?

00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:46,700
There's also a link to Miami.

00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:48,368
Of course there is.

00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:51,004
Or, you know, he could
just be some geriatric dude

00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,506
that just digs the weather.

00:20:52,572 --> 00:20:54,174
WILLOWS:
I don't understand.

00:20:54,241 --> 00:20:56,042
Why didn't the Feds
put this out on NCIC?

00:20:56,109 --> 00:20:57,677
Because they're Feds.

00:20:57,744 --> 00:20:59,112
Excuse me.

00:21:00,414 --> 00:21:04,050
Dennis... Dennis...

00:21:04,117 --> 00:21:05,318
Tick-tock, Dennis.

00:21:05,385 --> 00:21:07,120
While you're waiting
to get your ducks in a row

00:21:07,187 --> 00:21:08,188
the guy with
the "Miami link"

00:21:08,255 --> 00:21:09,356
just slipped
through my hands.

00:21:09,423 --> 00:21:11,258
Horatio, I didn't have
Federal approval...

00:21:11,324 --> 00:21:13,126
I need answers
for this little girl.

00:21:13,193 --> 00:21:15,829
Her father's just been killed,
maybe her mother, too.

00:21:15,896 --> 00:21:17,030
And that's your fault.

00:21:17,097 --> 00:21:18,098
You understand that.

00:21:18,165 --> 00:21:20,400
It sounds like you're
making this personal.

00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:23,236
Dennis, you don't give me
this link

00:21:23,303 --> 00:21:25,939
I will make this very personal.

00:21:27,774 --> 00:21:30,944
All of his victims stayed
here in the last year.

00:21:31,011 --> 00:21:32,379
Here? This hotel?

00:21:32,446 --> 00:21:35,115
Rittle and his wife, too.
Last winter.

00:21:35,182 --> 00:21:36,917
Mm, I wish I would have
known that.

00:21:36,983 --> 00:21:38,452
Maybe they'd still be alive.

00:21:38,518 --> 00:21:39,753
Yeah?

00:21:41,588 --> 00:21:43,724
( <i>speaking Spanish</i> )

00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:48,795
<i>Si... Vamos.</i>

00:21:48,862 --> 00:21:51,531
I had a bad feeling about this.

00:21:51,598 --> 00:21:52,699
What'd she just say to you?

00:21:52,766 --> 00:21:54,801
She just said that you need
to learn the language.

00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,793
I don't see this burgundy car.

00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,994
Where are you looking?

00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,385
Check the disturbance
along the bank

00:22:05,451 --> 00:22:06,786
and follow it in.

00:22:06,853 --> 00:22:08,021
How did you find
the disturbance?

00:22:08,087 --> 00:22:09,455
Drive up and down
the canals all day?

00:22:09,522 --> 00:22:11,557
No, the thing about Miami

00:22:11,624 --> 00:22:13,760
is the entire city's
watched from above.

00:22:13,826 --> 00:22:15,795
Coast Guard choppers.

00:22:15,862 --> 00:22:16,896
Someone going to cover me?

00:22:16,963 --> 00:22:17,930
I got you.

00:22:18,965 --> 00:22:21,034
WILLOWS:
Cover you for what?

00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,669
Alligators.

00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,125
Only way to
outrun a gator

00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,728
is to swim faster than
the guy next to you.

00:22:28,795 --> 00:22:30,263
Isn't that right, Delko?

00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,031
Used to have a partner.

00:22:32,098 --> 00:22:33,000
CAINE:
Guys...

00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,301
please?

00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:33,994
That her?

00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,563
Yeah, that's Mina Rittle.

00:23:53,914 --> 00:23:55,849
Our guy's still in the wind,
folks.

00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:59,352
Still in the wind.

00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:07,727
What's her name?

00:24:07,794 --> 00:24:08,962
Mina Rittle.

00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,844
Who wrapped you, Mina?

00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:15,083
The plastic wasn't
for transport.

00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:18,219
Covering her intimates--
most likely sexual.

00:24:18,286 --> 00:24:20,054
Two gunshot wounds
left temple.

00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:22,223
One shot was
a through-and-through.

00:24:23,892 --> 00:24:25,960
Trace ASAP, along
with the plastic.

00:24:26,027 --> 00:24:28,596
My preliminary probe

00:24:28,663 --> 00:24:30,098
shows water in the lungs

00:24:30,165 --> 00:24:32,300
which indicates
she was still alive

00:24:32,367 --> 00:24:34,235
when she was put
in the canal.

00:24:36,437 --> 00:24:38,039
Looks like the eyes

00:24:38,106 --> 00:24:40,475
are glued shut.

00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:44,712
Gold crusty substance
underneath.

00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:46,781
What is that, Mina?

00:24:53,087 --> 00:24:56,257
The substance is water-soluble.

00:24:56,324 --> 00:24:58,860
But somehow it got
preserved in the water.

00:24:58,927 --> 00:25:00,061
My guess is

00:25:00,128 --> 00:25:01,896
the plastic
was wrapped

00:25:01,963 --> 00:25:03,598
around her eyes
at some point.

00:25:03,665 --> 00:25:05,333
Wait a minute.

00:25:07,235 --> 00:25:09,170
There's a lot more of it.

00:25:11,172 --> 00:25:12,740
What do you
want to bet

00:25:12,807 --> 00:25:15,977
this is in every orifice?

00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,950
You guys got a sick one.

00:25:37,365 --> 00:25:39,134
Aha!

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,036
Delko, you've been down there
for 45 minutes.

00:25:42,103 --> 00:25:44,405
Do you know the level
of bacteria in the water?

00:25:44,472 --> 00:25:45,740
You can get
all kinds of infections.

00:25:45,807 --> 00:25:46,741
What do you got?

00:25:46,808 --> 00:25:48,510
Water pistol.

00:25:48,576 --> 00:25:51,513
One water-logged
Beretta knock-off.

00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:53,548
Suspect's personal gun?

00:25:53,615 --> 00:25:55,049
That's it.
Congratulations.

00:25:55,116 --> 00:25:57,018
I'll put it
over the wires

00:25:57,085 --> 00:25:59,287
that he's not carrying
that Taurus anymore.

00:25:59,354 --> 00:26:01,489
Do that, and take a shower.

00:26:01,556 --> 00:26:02,924
Nice shoes.

00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:07,695
Ma'am, you have
to concentrate
on the face.

00:26:07,762 --> 00:26:09,697
In parts, not
just the whole.

00:26:09,764 --> 00:26:11,065
Ask me
what he wore.

00:26:11,132 --> 00:26:13,067
Ask me if he was
good in bed.

00:26:13,134 --> 00:26:15,370
Just don't ask me
how close together
his eyes were.

00:26:15,436 --> 00:26:17,806
You said he kind of looked
like Ricky Martin, right?

00:26:17,872 --> 00:26:19,808
Yeah, with a touch of Jude Law.

00:26:19,874 --> 00:26:22,043
ARTIST:
Try to not
just picture him.

00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,012
Try to think of an event.

00:26:25,947 --> 00:26:27,749
Okay...

00:26:27,816 --> 00:26:29,751
Three-way kiss.

00:26:29,818 --> 00:26:31,920
His lower lip
was kind of pouty...

00:26:31,986 --> 00:26:34,722
and he had this

00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:37,625
Michael Douglas thing
working, you know---

00:26:37,692 --> 00:26:39,060
a cleft in his chin.

00:26:39,127 --> 00:26:40,061
Kind of like that?

00:26:40,128 --> 00:26:41,896
Yeah.

00:26:41,963 --> 00:26:45,066
You're right.
That is easier.

00:27:04,853 --> 00:27:06,287
Adam Van der Welk.

00:27:06,354 --> 00:27:08,456
Little girl saw a monster.

00:27:08,523 --> 00:27:10,391
Showgirl saw a husband.

00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:12,861
So this guy could be anybody.

00:27:12,927 --> 00:27:15,330
STOKES:
Yeah, that's the problem
with eyewitnesses.

00:27:15,396 --> 00:27:17,332
All the more reason
to rely on evidence.

00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:19,167
Tell Warrick hey.
Let me know if anything breaks.

00:27:19,234 --> 00:27:20,168
You, too.

00:27:20,235 --> 00:27:21,636
Hey.

00:27:21,703 --> 00:27:22,871
Hey.

00:27:22,937 --> 00:27:24,806
So, how's your colleague
Grissom doing

00:27:24,873 --> 00:27:25,840
on the aroma angle?

00:27:25,907 --> 00:27:27,342
I'm sure he's
making progress

00:27:27,408 --> 00:27:29,010
but Grissom rarely
says anything

00:27:29,077 --> 00:27:30,378
until he's good
and ready.

00:27:30,445 --> 00:27:31,913
Smart man.

00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,548
I just wanted to show
you something.

00:27:33,615 --> 00:27:35,416
The sticky substance
we got off the wife

00:27:35,483 --> 00:27:36,451
is, in fact, honey.

00:27:36,518 --> 00:27:38,620
You say that like
it means something.

00:27:38,686 --> 00:27:40,955
Well, honey on its own
is just honey

00:27:41,022 --> 00:27:44,959
but when you add plastic wrap,
it's... a different situation.

00:27:45,026 --> 00:27:47,896

00:28:24,566 --> 00:28:26,501
Yum.

00:28:26,568 --> 00:28:29,537
This is where
he got the idea.

00:28:29,604 --> 00:28:31,172
Yep. This is Hives.

00:28:31,239 --> 00:28:32,407
Wish me luck.

00:28:36,311 --> 00:28:37,712
Excuse me.

00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:39,514
Excuse me.

00:28:39,581 --> 00:28:41,249
Hi.

00:28:41,316 --> 00:28:43,451
Some guys like to lick it off.

00:28:43,518 --> 00:28:46,554
Really? I'm partial
to the swab myself.

00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:49,757
Ready, honey?

00:28:49,824 --> 00:28:51,159
Coming, dear.

00:28:54,963 --> 00:28:57,932
Tuberculosis victims
emit breath that smells

00:28:57,999 --> 00:28:59,067
like wet leaves.

00:28:59,134 --> 00:29:01,369
Maple, elm, ash, what?

00:29:01,436 --> 00:29:02,637
I'm not sure.

00:29:02,704 --> 00:29:04,539
Miami is pulling
cars out of canals--

00:29:04,606 --> 00:29:06,441
chasing leads,
debriefing the kid--

00:29:06,508 --> 00:29:08,243
and you guys are
flipping through textbooks?

00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:10,278
This is how I work.

I'm following my nosino.

You're closer to this
Van der Welk guy

00:29:20,688 --> 00:29:21,789
than you're letting on

00:29:21,856 --> 00:29:23,625
aren't you?

00:29:23,691 --> 00:29:26,427
Doctor...

00:29:26,494 --> 00:29:27,962
Doctor.

00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:29,931
How about Darier disease?

00:29:29,998 --> 00:29:31,633
Doesn't that
give you a rash

00:29:31,699 --> 00:29:33,701
that smells like
human excrement?

00:29:33,768 --> 00:29:36,504
We're looking for something
a little sweeter.

00:29:36,571 --> 00:29:37,539
There's diabetic

00:29:37,605 --> 00:29:39,107
ketoacidosis.

00:29:39,174 --> 00:29:42,343
Body has excess glucose
which converts to ketone...

00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:45,647
gets expelled
through the pores.

00:29:45,713 --> 00:29:47,715
Has a fruity smell.

00:29:47,782 --> 00:29:50,819
It would help if we had a piece
of the assailant's clothing.

00:29:54,088 --> 00:29:55,123
What?

00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,992
I think I overlooked
some evidence.

00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:03,932
SPEEDLE:
I'm going to isolate it
using high-performance

00:30:03,998 --> 00:30:06,234
liquid chromatography.

00:30:06,301 --> 00:30:08,336
Once we identify
the pollen

00:30:08,403 --> 00:30:10,472
we'll know if it's
floral honey.

00:30:17,712 --> 00:30:19,481
So, H, when's
the last time

00:30:19,547 --> 00:30:20,682
you were in Hives?

00:30:20,748 --> 00:30:22,484
I was there opening night.

00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,085
I didn't see you there.

00:30:24,152 --> 00:30:25,353
I was, uh...

00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,754
VIP.

00:30:29,891 --> 00:30:32,293
What is this?

00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,394
It's Tupelo honey.

00:30:33,461 --> 00:30:35,196
It's the purest
of all honeys.

00:30:35,263 --> 00:30:36,731
Stays in liquid form for life.

00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:38,299
Doesn't crystallize or harden.

00:30:38,366 --> 00:30:39,801
Where'd you get that?

00:30:39,868 --> 00:30:40,802
CDC hipped me to it

00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:42,670
after that Africanized
bee problem.

00:30:42,737 --> 00:30:44,539
Okay, let's swap
this out.

00:30:44,606 --> 00:30:47,142
I want you to take
a look at this.

00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,946
We got this off
the Chief's wife.

00:30:56,885 --> 00:30:58,019
It's a match.

00:30:59,721 --> 00:31:01,856
It's a match.

00:31:01,923 --> 00:31:03,591
WARRICK:
$500 for five dollars
worth of honey?

00:31:03,658 --> 00:31:04,926
I don't think
it's worth it.

00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:06,394
Those are mostly
for decoration

00:31:06,461 --> 00:31:07,896
but once in a while
some bigwig comes

00:31:07,962 --> 00:31:10,000
takes one of them out of here.

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,458
Wouldn't it have
been easier to put
these in order?

00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:12,693
This is going
to take forever.

00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,362

Maybe not. I've got a receipt
from just two nights ago.

00:31:15,429 --> 00:31:16,363
Let me see that.

00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:21,201
Do you recognize
this guy?

00:31:21,268 --> 00:31:23,404
Yeah, looks just like
every other Joe

that comes in here.

00:31:24,571 --> 00:31:25,939
Look, you work the door.

00:31:26,006 --> 00:31:28,308
Anybody come in here
in the last 48 hours

00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:31,583
that bought some of that
very expensive Tupelo honey

00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:32,626
This is Miami.

00:31:32,692 --> 00:31:34,527
Every night's a weekend.

00:31:34,594 --> 00:31:35,729
My people tell me
that a customer

00:31:35,795 --> 00:31:37,464
came in here two nights ago
to buy some.

00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,199
Wasn't a customer.
It was a limo driver.

00:31:39,266 --> 00:31:40,433
A limo driver?

00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,434
Yeah, Gordon.

00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:42,969
Gave me a C-note
just to double park.

00:31:43,036 --> 00:31:44,070
Did this Gordon tell you

00:31:44,137 --> 00:31:45,438
who he had in back
of his car?

00:31:45,505 --> 00:31:46,439
No.

00:31:46,506 --> 00:31:48,541
Just that it was some rich guy--

00:31:48,608 --> 00:31:49,676
some high roller.

00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:52,412
Let me guess-- from Vegas.

00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:53,747
Yeah.

00:31:57,517 --> 00:32:00,887
( <i>siren blaring</i> )

00:32:05,525 --> 00:32:06,893
How'd you find him?

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,195
Figured, limo driver--
airport.

00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:11,765
I spotted Gordon
here on Alton--

00:32:11,831 --> 00:32:14,367
back way to
Miami International.

00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:17,070
Lit him up,
pulled him over here.

00:32:17,137 --> 00:32:18,438
Nice work.

00:32:18,505 --> 00:32:20,006
You got a
last name, Gordon?

00:32:20,073 --> 00:32:21,041
Daimler.

00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:23,143
Look, Officer,
the Corwins are coming in

00:32:23,209 --> 00:32:24,511
on their own private jet.

00:32:24,577 --> 00:32:26,279
They're two of my
best customers.

00:32:26,346 --> 00:32:27,647
I really should be there.

00:32:27,714 --> 00:32:30,016
Well, the Corwins
are going to have to wait.

00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:32,585
WILLOWS:
We understand that
another one of your customers

00:32:32,652 --> 00:32:35,155
bought some
very expensive honey

00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:36,523
from a club.

00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:38,491
Yeah, well, I've had
stranger requests.

00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:41,127
This customer of yours
have a name?

00:32:41,194 --> 00:32:42,529
Never got it.
He paid cash.

00:32:42,595 --> 00:32:43,830
Never saw a credit card.

00:32:43,897 --> 00:32:45,699
Well, did you notice
anything unusual

00:32:45,765 --> 00:32:46,967
about him?

00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:49,135
Did he smell?

00:32:49,202 --> 00:32:50,503
Did he...

00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,538
have an odor?

00:32:51,605 --> 00:32:53,073
Uh, his breath maybe.

00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:54,941
He'd been drinking a lot.

00:32:55,008 --> 00:32:56,076
Remember what
he was drinking?

00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:57,310
Was it sweet
like Irish whiskey?

00:32:57,377 --> 00:32:58,979
Whatever I have stocked.

00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:00,313
Well, we'd like
to take a look.

00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,648
Sure. Go ahead.

00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:32,379
Gin.

00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:35,081
( <i>engine starting</i> )

00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:46,593
Hmm.

00:33:50,997 --> 00:33:52,032
Smell that?

00:33:52,098 --> 00:33:53,366
Sickly sweet.

00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:55,268
That's exactly how

00:33:55,335 --> 00:33:57,804
Grissom
described it.

00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:04,277
You want me
to do what?

00:34:04,344 --> 00:34:06,479
Smell this.

00:34:15,689 --> 00:34:16,656
That's it.

00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:18,391
That's Adam's smell.

00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:20,360
In the five days
that you two were together

00:34:20,427 --> 00:34:22,529
did you happen to notice
what he was drinking?

00:34:22,595 --> 00:34:24,531
Champagne.

00:34:24,598 --> 00:34:26,433
Did he ever drink
anything sweeter

00:34:26,499 --> 00:34:27,767
like whiskey or cognac?

00:34:27,834 --> 00:34:29,469
Are you kidding me?

00:34:29,536 --> 00:34:32,772
With him it was all Dom
all the time.

00:34:34,674 --> 00:34:36,509
You found a medical condition.

00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:38,511
GRISSOM:
Diabetic ketoacidosis--

00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:40,347
it's an insulin deficiency.

00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:43,083
His body's been expelling
excess glucose.

00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:44,351
Makes him smell fruity.

00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:47,320
Which I guess
could easily
be mistaken

00:34:47,387 --> 00:34:48,888
for whiskey breath.

00:34:48,955 --> 00:34:49,889
Hey, can you

00:34:49,956 --> 00:34:54,127
test for diabetic
ketoacidosis off urine?

00:34:54,194 --> 00:34:55,495
Well, blood's the best

00:34:55,562 --> 00:34:57,797
but if you had a urine sample,
maybe.

00:34:57,864 --> 00:35:01,301
Ask him what medication
you would take for that.

00:35:01,368 --> 00:35:03,470
What would
a doctor prescribe?

00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:05,605
Novalin insulin.

00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:10,185
Lucky for us we found
blood in his urine.

00:35:10,252 --> 00:35:12,583
Absence of C-Peptide
in the blood.

00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:14,792
Means the insulin
in our guy's system

00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:16,333
isn't natural--
it's synthetic.

00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:17,667
And prescribed.

00:35:17,667 --> 00:35:19,834
We're right over here.
This is our database.

00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:25,041
Okay, what we're looking for
is a patient

00:35:25,108 --> 00:35:27,644
who's purchased
synthetic insulin

00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:29,446
in the last 48 hours.

00:35:34,317 --> 00:35:37,020
Here we go.

00:35:43,193 --> 00:35:44,628
Gordon Daimler.

00:35:44,694 --> 00:35:46,830
That's the limo driver.

00:35:46,897 --> 00:35:48,031
That's him.

00:35:48,098 --> 00:35:50,634
And the reason that old Gordon
probably didn't smell

00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,935
when we picked him up

00:35:52,002 --> 00:35:54,271
is because he'd just taken
his insulin, hadn't he?

00:35:54,337 --> 00:35:58,074
But the scent was still
in the limo's AC system.

00:35:58,141 --> 00:36:00,343
Well, now we have
this guy's address.

00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,878
Yes, take a look
at this address.

00:36:01,945 --> 00:36:02,913
A limousine driver

00:36:02,979 --> 00:36:05,982
with a house on the water
in Coconut Grove?

00:36:06,049 --> 00:36:07,250
I don't think so.

00:36:07,317 --> 00:36:10,587
Who's the owner of record?

00:36:10,654 --> 00:36:12,622
Let's check it.

00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:16,927
Sissy and Dylan Corwin.

00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:22,583
That's the couple
he was picking up at the airport

00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:23,667
when we pulled him over.

00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:24,701
That's right.

00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:27,542
So then maybe that's how
he finds his victims--

00:36:27,542 --> 00:36:28,610
driving a limo.

00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:32,837
And when they're away
at some posh resort

00:36:32,903 --> 00:36:35,573
he moves into
their house,
doesn't he?

00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,476
Hops over to Las Vegas.

00:36:38,542 --> 00:36:40,177
Visits the couple
he met in Miami.

00:36:40,244 --> 00:36:41,679
Kills the husband...
Mm-hmm.

00:36:41,746 --> 00:36:44,015
...brings the wife
back here-- kills her.

00:36:44,081 --> 00:36:45,708
And when the Corwins
come home...

00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:48,693
not good.

00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:03,469
WILLOW:
No one's answering inside.

00:37:08,474 --> 00:37:10,309
Miami-Dade Police!

00:37:43,176 --> 00:37:44,377
Slowly.

00:37:46,512 --> 00:37:47,714
Slowly.

00:38:06,099 --> 00:38:08,167
I got a blood trail here.

00:38:08,234 --> 00:38:10,336
Leading to the garage.

00:38:52,879 --> 00:38:55,515
He dragged the body to here...

00:38:55,581 --> 00:38:57,450
Put her in that car.

00:38:57,517 --> 00:38:58,885
Nine-mil.

00:39:02,922 --> 00:39:04,390
One shot's
a through-and-through.

00:39:04,457 --> 00:39:05,525
Scalp hair.

00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,562
He fired this
one first.

00:39:09,629 --> 00:39:10,930
I don't know.

00:39:10,997 --> 00:39:12,832
To terrorize her.

00:39:12,899 --> 00:39:14,734
This strike here.

00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:16,402
That one's all business.

00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,565
He wrapped her
in plastic by the bed

00:39:45,631 --> 00:39:46,699
raped her.

00:39:46,766 --> 00:39:48,334
Then dragged her
in here

00:39:48,401 --> 00:39:50,603
and cornered her
like an animal.

00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,505
If Gordon's true to form

00:39:52,572 --> 00:39:53,940
he's going
to kill the Corwins.

00:39:54,006 --> 00:39:56,542
You guys should take
a look at this.

00:39:57,877 --> 00:39:59,479
Well, people don't really

00:39:59,545 --> 00:40:01,347
buy these houses
for the view.

00:40:01,414 --> 00:40:04,083
It's a place to put
a million-dollar boat.

00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,585
But what's your point?

00:40:08,688 --> 00:40:10,356
The boat's missing

00:40:10,423 --> 00:40:13,359
and that's where he's
killing them right now.

00:40:13,426 --> 00:40:14,708
Speed, get on that thing
right now.

00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:17,000
Put the birds in the air
and call the Coast Guard.

00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,068
Right now. Do it.

00:40:18,135 --> 00:40:19,903
Air and Sea, this
is Tim Speedle.

00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,672
I need you to be
on the lookout

00:40:21,738 --> 00:40:22,739
for a yacht, T-45.

00:40:22,806 --> 00:40:24,274
R.O. Dylan and
Sissy Corwin.

00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:26,276
Commandeered
by one Gordon Daimler.

00:40:26,343 --> 00:40:27,811
Gordon Daimler.

00:40:27,878 --> 00:40:29,279
Commandeered by...

00:40:29,346 --> 00:40:30,581
Gordon Daimler.

00:40:36,153 --> 00:40:38,288
Coast Guard found her adrift!

00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:39,923
No radio contact!

00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:42,543
We hailed her.

00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:43,977
No response.

00:40:44,044 --> 00:40:45,279
Infrared's up.

00:40:45,345 --> 00:40:46,947
Blue means dead,
red means alive.

00:40:47,014 --> 00:40:48,449
Pink.

00:40:48,515 --> 00:40:50,150
Body heat's fading.
Person's dying.

00:40:50,217 --> 00:40:51,485
Identify the
other players.

00:40:51,552 --> 00:40:52,486
Speed?

00:40:52,553 --> 00:40:55,089
Red. Is that our suspect?

00:40:55,155 --> 00:40:56,356
I'm not sure.

00:40:56,423 --> 00:40:57,424
I am.

00:40:57,491 --> 00:40:58,659
How?

00:40:58,726 --> 00:41:00,794
We haven't identified
all the players.

00:41:00,861 --> 00:41:02,930
He's going back to finish off
the job. Detweiler.

00:41:02,996 --> 00:41:04,598
Getting a bead on him, sir.

00:41:04,665 --> 00:41:05,766
The M.O.
on this guy

00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:08,102
says husband's already dead.

00:41:08,168 --> 00:41:10,404
He's going back to
finish off the wife.

00:41:10,471 --> 00:41:11,438
You're good to go.

00:41:11,505 --> 00:41:12,973
Body language
does not

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,508
look like an attack.

00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:22,826
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

00:41:22,893 --> 00:41:24,128
Don't the Corwins
have a jet?

00:41:24,194 --> 00:41:25,229
The Corwins have a jet!

00:41:25,295 --> 00:41:26,363
That's where
Daimler is.

00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,032
It's the Corwins
in there.

00:41:28,098 --> 00:41:30,234
Abort this, Sackheim!
Abort this!

00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,603
Interstate case,
not your call! Proceed!

00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,271
Stand down!

00:41:34,338 --> 00:41:35,773
Take him out!

00:41:37,508 --> 00:41:38,642
Detweiler,
I know you want

00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:39,677
to impress your boss

00:41:39,743 --> 00:41:41,578
but there's an innocent
man on that boat.

00:41:41,645 --> 00:41:42,780
Now, if you
take this shot

00:41:42,846 --> 00:41:44,181
I'm going to be
in your grille

00:41:44,248 --> 00:41:45,783
for the rest of
your natural life.

00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:46,784
I want you to think

00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,719
about what that
might be like.

00:41:50,321 --> 00:41:51,488
Think about that.

00:41:58,996 --> 00:42:01,231
Thank you. Speed,
the Corwins have a jet.

00:42:01,298 --> 00:42:02,733
Find the jet.

00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,135
Call the FAA
and ground the jet

00:42:05,202 --> 00:42:07,671
by authority
of Miami-Dade <i>County.</i>

00:42:07,738 --> 00:42:08,872
You got it, H.

00:42:08,939 --> 00:42:09,940
Give us 30 seconds.

00:42:10,007 --> 00:42:11,008
Then send backup!

00:42:17,748 --> 00:42:18,682
Mr. Corwin!

00:42:18,749 --> 00:42:22,686
I tried to save her.

00:42:22,753 --> 00:42:24,088
It's too late.

00:42:24,154 --> 00:42:25,422
I'm sorry.

00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:27,391
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:42:29,827 --> 00:42:31,962
Get me Fire Rescue.

00:42:36,433 --> 00:42:39,458
Few more minutes, sir.
We'll be on the way to Monaco.

00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:49,835
Good evening.

00:42:50,542 --> 00:42:53,706
Mr. Van der Welk.

00:42:53,772 --> 00:42:55,908
Gordon, drive
your limo here?

00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:59,244
He's clean.

00:42:59,311 --> 00:43:01,180
The Corwins...

00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:02,181
are my friends.

00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:03,615
They lent me this plane.

00:43:03,682 --> 00:43:05,542
Like the lent you their boat?

00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:07,177
Speak to the pilot.

00:43:07,244 --> 00:43:09,613
Dylan Corwin called
him personally.

00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:11,915
Directed him to fly me
to Monaco.

00:43:11,982 --> 00:43:15,485
I'd rather call "Dylan"
at the hospital to confirm.

00:43:15,552 --> 00:43:17,854
WILLOW:
The husband
didn't die.

00:43:17,921 --> 00:43:19,623
He left us a witness

00:43:19,689 --> 00:43:21,591
and enough evidence
to convict you

00:43:21,658 --> 00:43:23,026
in two states.

00:43:23,093 --> 00:43:25,362
Rich men don't go to jail.

00:43:25,428 --> 00:43:27,697
You're not rich, Gordon.

00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:37,140
I'm going to, uh...

00:43:37,207 --> 00:43:38,675
I'm going
to book this guy.

00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:39,876
You want to go with?

00:43:39,943 --> 00:43:41,177
Nah, you got it.

00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:43,213
I'll have my DA
call your DA.

00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,514
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:47,017
Sounds good.

00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,351
Sounds good.

00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:51,454
Uh... Thank you
for your help on this.

00:43:51,521 --> 00:43:53,890
Thanks for yours, actually.

00:43:53,957 --> 00:43:56,059
Right.

00:43:57,627 --> 00:43:59,129
You take care of yourself.

00:43:59,195 --> 00:44:01,598
I always do.

00:44:19,382 --> 00:44:20,483
Hey.

00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:29,993
My mommy and daddy are dead,
aren't they?

00:44:33,263 --> 00:44:37,000
Well, your aunt is flying in
to talk to you.

00:44:37,867 --> 00:44:40,270
That's a yes.

00:44:42,272 --> 00:44:44,608
I lost someone once.

00:44:44,674 --> 00:44:47,310
Who?

00:44:47,377 --> 00:44:50,947
Well...

00:44:51,014 --> 00:44:53,016
Did you feel sick?

00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:54,384
Still do.

00:44:54,451 --> 00:44:56,453
Still do.

00:44:58,521 --> 00:45:00,090
Sasha.

00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:01,992
People are going to say
a lot of things

00:45:02,058 --> 00:45:03,126
about your mom and dad

00:45:03,193 --> 00:45:04,961
and some of them
are going to be true

00:45:05,028 --> 00:45:07,097
but what I want you to remember

00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:09,633
is that they fought
like heroes for you.

00:45:09,699 --> 00:45:12,702
Will you remember
that for me?

00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:16,773
Good.

00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,041
Good for you.

00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:30,320
Hello.

00:45:31,588 --> 00:45:32,789
Hey.

00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:36,826
Nice tan.

00:45:36,893 --> 00:45:38,662
Nice suit.

00:45:38,728 --> 00:45:40,163
Yeah, well,
I knew you were

00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:43,099
coming back today,
so I dressed up.

00:45:43,166 --> 00:45:44,301
Yeah.

00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:45,769
Right.

00:45:45,835 --> 00:45:48,905
Really.

00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,675
What?

00:45:51,741 --> 00:45:53,009
Nothing.

00:45:53,076 --> 00:45:57,180
It's just... unusual
to see you dressed like that.

00:45:57,247 --> 00:46:00,517
I had to go
to the Chief's funeral.

00:46:00,584 --> 00:46:02,986
Missed me that much, huh?
