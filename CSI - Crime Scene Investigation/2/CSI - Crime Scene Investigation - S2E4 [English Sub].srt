People aren't usually scared
of class clowns.

Who said his shooter was scared?

00:01:21,962 --> 00:01:24,531

There's been a murder here,

It's school policy, Miss.

in high school.

Worse.

Ooh... You were the girl
I ran away from.

00:02:45,886 --> 00:02:49,223
Yeah, till you caught me.

00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,375
So you say football
practice was over
at 5:45?

00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:53,376
That's right.

00:02:53,443 --> 00:02:55,667
And it was okay
for a student like the victim

00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:57,875
to return to the school property
to use the restroom?

00:02:58,181 --> 00:02:59,682
That wasn't out
of the ordinary?

00:02:59,749 --> 00:03:00,683
Hand me a bindle.

Yeah, a little.

Yeah, it better.

Wait.

Orange, by my kit.

00:06:02,253 --> 00:06:04,555

Paint from another source.

00:06:13,297 --> 00:06:14,499
I'm going
to find out

00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:16,567
who belongs to that locker.

00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,338
Kind of weird
being in a high school, huh?

00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:22,440
They do have a timeless quality.

00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,642
What were you?
A jock or a brain?

00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:26,077
I was a ghost.

And...?

00:06:47,844 --> 00:06:50,646
Reconstruction guys
can give us a more precise

00:06:50,713 --> 00:06:52,381
angle measurement,
but I'm thinking...

00:06:52,448 --> 00:06:54,150
Five-four...

00:06:54,217 --> 00:06:55,151
maybe three.

00:06:55,218 --> 00:06:56,274
We got ourselves a shorty.

00:06:58,309 --> 00:07:01,212
STOKES:
Let's see what metal shows up.

00:07:03,314 --> 00:07:05,516
Well, there's no gun
on our dead body.

00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,251
Wouldn't it be easier
to just unzip the bag

00:07:07,318 --> 00:07:08,920
and see what kind of shape
our vic is in?

00:07:08,986 --> 00:07:10,021
I like to put that off

00:07:10,088 --> 00:07:11,923
till the last possible moment
with decomps.

00:07:13,624 --> 00:07:17,458
I see a coin.
Looks like a half dollar.

00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:19,430
PHILLIPS:
Silver, whole.

00:07:19,497 --> 00:07:21,065
I've done a few of these.

00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:24,535
STOKES:
What's that?

00:07:24,602 --> 00:07:26,938
There. About
four inches long.
What is that?

00:07:27,004 --> 00:07:28,272
PHILLIPS:
It looks like a pin.

00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:29,874
It's a medical implant.

00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,612
Oh, and that's a
plate in the skull.

00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:36,614
The head's
been rolled.

00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:38,449
I'd say we're dealing
with a male.

00:07:38,516 --> 00:07:41,041
Yeah, and by the sound of things
he's been dead about two months.

00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,093
Sound?

00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,402
You weren't here when
ESD brought this in.

00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:48,538
Well, it wasn't from
lack of trying.

00:07:51,074 --> 00:07:52,743
PHILLIPS:
Let's go to
the VIP room.

00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:55,245
I'll show you what I mean.

00:07:59,716 --> 00:08:01,618
That's Dennis Fram's locker.

00:08:01,685 --> 00:08:02,919
And was this a first

00:08:02,986 --> 00:08:05,122
or has the deceased
spray-painted his locker before?

00:08:05,188 --> 00:08:06,556
Look, I'm the school counselor

00:08:06,623 --> 00:08:08,492
I don't know every move
these kids make.

00:08:08,558 --> 00:08:11,495
Well, that's obvious
or a young man wouldn't be dead.

00:08:13,263 --> 00:08:16,333
Tell me what "stick" means.

00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,574
Is that a polymer
sensor proboscis?

00:08:24,641 --> 00:08:26,443
Cyranose 320.

00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,146
Company sent it to me,
gratis for a week.

00:08:29,212 --> 00:08:30,514
They figure if it helps

00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,682
CSI will buy one.

00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:33,684
Electronic noses
run like ten grand.

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,585
Yeah, well,
what if the shooter

00:08:35,652 --> 00:08:37,521
chews a certain kind
of tobacco

00:08:37,587 --> 00:08:41,058
or has a unique halitosis
and the e-nose picks up on it?

00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:43,961
If that thing ran out of here
and bit the shooter in the ass

00:08:44,027 --> 00:08:45,362
the county would not approve

00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:47,898
a $10,000
purchase order.

00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:51,501
I thought it was our job
to speak for the victim

00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:52,803
no matter what it took.

00:08:52,869 --> 00:08:54,504
And to hell with the budgets.

00:08:54,571 --> 00:08:56,406
Our job is to think, Warrick.

00:08:56,473 --> 00:08:59,676
Machinery should never matter
more than our mind.

00:09:01,445 --> 00:09:02,846
Try this.

00:09:05,215 --> 00:09:07,384
Glass tube.

00:09:07,451 --> 00:09:08,418
Air pump.

00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:09,519
Air pump.

00:09:09,586 --> 00:09:11,555
Cost about ten bucks.

00:09:11,622 --> 00:09:14,391
Absorption agent?

00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:18,028
Fresh out. Improvise.

00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:24,368
WILLOWS:
And Miss Barrett says

00:09:24,434 --> 00:09:26,136
that a Dennis Fram

00:09:26,203 --> 00:09:27,771
had been bullied by
the deceased all year.

00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,539
He spray-painted his locker
many times

00:09:29,606 --> 00:09:31,341
always something to do
with his build.

00:09:31,408 --> 00:09:32,442
"Skinny," "shorty"

00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:33,443
that kind
of thing.

00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,544
Dennis is slight

00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,079
and Barry always
picks on him for it.

00:09:36,146 --> 00:09:38,548
Can you arrange for us
to meet with Dennis?

00:09:38,615 --> 00:09:40,951
Of course, but he
would never hurt Barry.

00:09:41,018 --> 00:09:42,386
He's a good kid.

00:09:42,452 --> 00:09:44,655
He's totally nonviolent.

00:09:44,721 --> 00:09:46,490
Well, then,
this will be brief.

00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:53,163
We can call him
from my office.

00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,965
GRISSOM:
Cathy, you coming?

00:09:55,032 --> 00:09:57,367
Oh, I'll catch
up to you.

00:10:01,571 --> 00:10:02,673
Hey...

00:10:02,739 --> 00:10:04,508
I need to
talk to you.

00:10:04,574 --> 00:10:06,610
I didn't clean anything.

00:10:06,677 --> 00:10:08,946
It's not about that.

00:10:09,012 --> 00:10:10,447
How tall are you, Dennis?

00:10:13,517 --> 00:10:15,719
Five-three and one quarter.

00:10:17,587 --> 00:10:19,856
Have you washed your hands
in the last hour?

00:10:19,923 --> 00:10:21,625
Yeah. Why?

00:10:21,692 --> 00:10:23,427
Changed your shirt?

00:10:23,493 --> 00:10:25,462
No.

00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,264
I'd like to do a test
on your shirt if I may.

00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:29,099
What kind of test?

GRISSOM:
G.S.R.

00:10:54,891 --> 00:10:56,660
When someone fires a weapon

00:10:56,727 --> 00:10:58,495
gunshot residue plumes back

00:10:58,562 --> 00:11:00,330
onto their hands
and clothing.

00:11:05,435 --> 00:11:06,703
This means that you fired a gun

00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,171
within the last
three to six hours.

00:11:08,238 --> 00:11:09,206
Dennis...

00:11:09,273 --> 00:11:11,275
The police are going to want
to talk to you.

00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:16,375
BRASS:
So, you admit
you fired a gun.

00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,667
DENNIS:
I was over at the shooting range
on Desert Way.

00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:20,750
So the same night
that Barry Schickel was shot and killed

00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:23,151
you were out
taking target practice?

00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:24,318
I go every Monday night.

00:11:24,385 --> 00:11:26,875
You can ask my sister.
She goes with me.

00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,122
Where's your gun?

00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:29,891
I rent different ones there.

00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:31,492
Did you ever rent a .44 caliber?

00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:34,662
Sometimes.

00:11:34,729 --> 00:11:36,030
I'm going to see
my brother!

00:11:36,097 --> 00:11:38,633
Get out of the way!

00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,001
Denny, are you okay?
Got your call.

00:11:40,068 --> 00:11:41,736
I'm fine, I'm fine.

00:11:41,803 --> 00:11:43,871
We're conducting
a police investigation here.

00:11:43,938 --> 00:11:45,273
My dad's back in town tonight

00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:47,742
and you'll be sorry
you harassed my little brother.

00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:48,976
Questioned.

00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:52,246
A student was shot and killed
in this building tonight.

00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:53,881
You know what?

00:11:53,948 --> 00:11:56,050
Dennis has explained to you
about the gunpowder.

00:11:56,117 --> 00:11:57,051
and I am sure

00:11:57,118 --> 00:11:59,253
his sister will vouch
for his whereabouts.

00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,888
And he's a minor.

00:12:00,955 --> 00:12:01,856
Jim.

00:12:01,923 --> 00:12:04,926
We'll be in touch.

00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:13,594
Well, we are 73.5%
liquid, eh, Dave?

00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:17,131
Add some bacteria,
a couple gases, and... voila!

00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:20,835
Okay, I'll take Liquid Man's
jacket, see what I can find.

00:13:20,902 --> 00:13:22,070
I'll cremate this.

00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:23,938
What if we find
the family or
they find us?

the better.

Yeah.

00:13:42,757 --> 00:13:43,758
Yeah, in a zip bag.

Barry Schickel

Dug three of these .44's
from his back.

00:15:34,302 --> 00:15:36,771

his infraspinous fossa.

pierced the heart.

The heart?
That makes no sense.

00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,986

This guy was attacked before.

00:15:57,792 --> 00:15:59,460

But not with a knife,
it looks like prongs.

00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:06,300

would've killed him.

had been there.

Until I fixed him.

00:20:27,146 --> 00:20:30,583
It was about half a year ago,
I went at him.

00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:32,218
GRISSOM:
With a fork?

00:20:32,284 --> 00:20:34,687
Stabbed him above
his left pectoral.

00:20:34,754 --> 00:20:37,289
Yeah.

00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:39,058
It still didn't stop him.

00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,193
I mean, today was the first day
I could come to school

00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,195
and not feel
like a moving target.

00:20:43,262 --> 00:20:46,065
Where were you last
night about 6:00?

00:20:46,132 --> 00:20:48,834
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
When Barry was shot?

00:20:50,469 --> 00:20:55,374
Boxing practice.

00:20:55,441 --> 00:20:58,778
Okay. Thanks.

00:21:01,113 --> 00:21:04,050
I can protect them

00:21:04,116 --> 00:21:07,253
from being called
a derogatory word for homosexual

00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,322
or the N-word.

00:21:09,388 --> 00:21:11,891
Everything else falls
under free speech.

00:21:11,957 --> 00:21:14,060
No one's blaming you.

00:21:14,126 --> 00:21:16,729
I am.

00:21:16,796 --> 00:21:19,865
You know who did
this, don't you?

00:21:19,932 --> 00:21:24,670
You have no idea
what these kids go through.

00:21:24,737 --> 00:21:28,274
I listen to them <i>every</i> day.

00:21:28,341 --> 00:21:30,543
Divorce, working parents...

00:21:30,609 --> 00:21:32,511
<i>Cliques.</i>

00:21:32,578 --> 00:21:36,115
And all they need is just one
person to believe in them.

00:21:36,182 --> 00:21:40,086
Yeah.

00:21:40,152 --> 00:21:42,755
But where does that
leave Barry Schickel?

00:21:42,822 --> 00:21:45,524
That's your job.

00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,259
Shut up. She was not.

00:21:53,326 --> 00:21:54,928
I saw her in action.

00:21:54,995 --> 00:21:56,096
Really?

00:21:56,162 --> 00:21:57,063
Yeah, she was.

00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,431
Catherine?

00:21:58,498 --> 00:21:59,566
I was what?

00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:03,792
I was just telling Nick
how you were a big bully

00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:05,071
in high school.

00:22:05,138 --> 00:22:06,106
A bully?

00:22:06,172 --> 00:22:07,240
All right, I guess I was.

00:22:07,307 --> 00:22:08,375
But, I mean,
not the kind

00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:10,944
that people want to take
a gun out and shoot.

00:22:11,011 --> 00:22:11,945
No.

00:22:12,012 --> 00:22:12,746
No, no.

00:22:12,812 --> 00:22:13,913
You were the kind

00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,082
that guys fall all over
themselves trying to impress.

00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:17,417
Like you, Nick, huh?

00:22:20,754 --> 00:22:23,356
Oh, Nick, uh...
what were you in high school?

00:22:23,423 --> 00:22:26,493
Me? I was, uh...

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,228
I was dependable.

00:22:28,294 --> 00:22:29,796
Dependable.

00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:33,566
Dependable jock,
dependable stoner?

00:22:33,633 --> 00:22:35,301
No, never a strap,
never a smoker.

00:22:35,368 --> 00:22:38,138
Just all-around
dependable guy, I guess.

00:22:38,204 --> 00:22:39,939
He's trying to say
he was unpopular.

00:22:40,006 --> 00:22:42,242
I was popular
with the right people

00:22:42,308 --> 00:22:43,343
I can tell you that.

00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,178
I can also tell you
what I wasn't.

00:22:45,245 --> 00:22:46,746
I wasn't a Mac Daddy wannabe

00:22:46,813 --> 00:22:48,515
with a Members Only jacket,
putting his swerve

00:22:48,581 --> 00:22:50,083
on all the ladies.

00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,418
What was wrong with those
Members Only jackets?

00:22:51,484 --> 00:22:52,552
They were kind of cool
back in the day.

00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:54,120
SARA:
Hey, Nick.

00:22:54,187 --> 00:22:56,656
Ronnie's got something
on Liquid Man, says it's hot.

00:22:56,723 --> 00:22:58,291
Good.

00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:01,828
Hey, Sara, what were you
in high school?

00:23:01,895 --> 00:23:04,698
Science nerd.

00:23:04,764 --> 00:23:05,865
You changed...

00:23:05,932 --> 00:23:08,335
( <i>whispering</i> ):
but you still smell.

00:23:08,401 --> 00:23:09,903
Let's go.

00:23:09,969 --> 00:23:11,905
So that leaves you, Warrick.

00:23:11,971 --> 00:23:13,340
What were you?

00:23:13,406 --> 00:23:18,044
Oh, I was short, I had
big feet, thick glasses.

00:23:18,111 --> 00:23:19,145
You?!

00:23:19,212 --> 00:23:20,280
Yeah.

00:23:20,347 --> 00:23:22,615
I got pushed around
by all the guys

00:23:22,682 --> 00:23:24,818
and never got any play
from the girls.

00:23:24,884 --> 00:23:28,488
The girls didn't
even notice your eyes?

00:23:28,555 --> 00:23:30,056
No, they used to tease
me about my eyes.

00:23:30,123 --> 00:23:31,124
Called me names.

00:23:31,191 --> 00:23:34,728
Aw. Well, what do they know?

00:23:34,794 --> 00:23:36,162
They're your best feature.

00:23:36,229 --> 00:23:38,498
I didn't have a best feature
in high school.

00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:42,235
Looking back on it now

00:23:42,302 --> 00:23:44,404
I can say I could see
both sides of it

00:23:44,471 --> 00:23:47,507
thinking about this
guy Barry Schickel,
and how he was shot

00:23:47,574 --> 00:23:49,109
and whichever kid did it.

00:23:49,175 --> 00:23:54,114
I'm not saying it was right, but
I kind of understand, you know?

00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,450
Yeah.

00:24:04,758 --> 00:24:07,027
I wanted to hold off
on this matchbook

00:24:07,093 --> 00:24:08,294
until it dried out

00:24:08,361 --> 00:24:09,396
but then I realized...

00:24:09,462 --> 00:24:12,132
Human fat never dries out,
it just gets waxy.

00:24:12,198 --> 00:24:13,299
Exactly.

00:24:13,366 --> 00:24:19,572
What I'm doing is adding pixels
at some points

00:24:19,639 --> 00:24:22,575
and erasing pixels
at other points.

00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,095
Got it.

00:24:42,162 --> 00:24:44,030
"Roma..."

00:24:44,097 --> 00:24:46,599
"Roman... nini's..."

00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:47,600
Never heard of it.

00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:49,336
NICK:
I have.

00:24:49,402 --> 00:24:51,204
Nightclub for boomers
off the strip.

00:24:51,271 --> 00:24:52,238
Thanks, man.

00:24:52,305 --> 00:24:53,473
You bet.

00:24:56,042 --> 00:24:57,043
O'RILEY:
Hey, Stokes.

00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,845
Your "W. Cartsen"?

00:24:58,912 --> 00:24:59,980
Yeah?

00:25:00,046 --> 00:25:02,115
He's a Second Lieutenant
William Cartsen.

00:25:02,182 --> 00:25:04,517
Served in the war,
wounded in action.

00:25:04,584 --> 00:25:05,585
Got sent stateside

00:25:05,652 --> 00:25:07,220
after they put him
back together.

00:25:07,287 --> 00:25:09,055
They put a pin in his spine

00:25:09,122 --> 00:25:11,491
and a plate in his head
31 years ago.

00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:14,961
Walked out of the hospital,
hasn't been heard of since.

00:25:15,028 --> 00:25:16,896
Okay. Come with us.

00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:04,811
( <i>beep</i> )

00:26:04,878 --> 00:26:06,413
What's the matter,
you don't trust me?

00:26:07,447 --> 00:26:08,848
I trust you.

00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:19,392
I got a boatload
of chemical components here.

00:26:19,459 --> 00:26:23,596
Marijuana, bubble gum, cigars.

00:26:23,663 --> 00:26:26,299
It's like every guy's
bathroom in America.

00:26:26,366 --> 00:26:27,600
What doesn't belong?

00:26:36,876 --> 00:26:38,945
How can I help you people?

00:26:39,012 --> 00:26:41,815
Valet guy said
you're the manager.

00:26:41,881 --> 00:26:43,984
Detective O'Riley,
Las Vegas P.D.

00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,285
Stokes and Sidle
from the Crime Lab.

00:26:45,352 --> 00:26:46,653
Crime Lab?

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,521
What's going on?

00:26:48,588 --> 00:26:50,657
This man a patron
of your establishment?

00:26:50,724 --> 00:26:52,292
Name's William Cartsen.

00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:54,694
Not that I recognize, no.

00:26:54,761 --> 00:26:56,062
Are you sure you haven't
seen him around here?

00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:00,033
Wore an Army jacket,
might've been down on his luck?

00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,635
Oh, you mean Moses.

00:27:02,702 --> 00:27:04,004
Moses?

00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,039
Yeah, guy had a beard
down to here, wore a robe

00:27:06,106 --> 00:27:08,341
the Army jacket.

00:27:08,408 --> 00:27:11,711
Stood out here scaring
every patron I had.

00:27:11,778 --> 00:27:13,513
Hey!

00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,881
The whole world is watching.

00:27:14,948 --> 00:27:15,582
Bidi dou!

00:27:15,649 --> 00:27:16,383
Bidi dou!

00:27:16,449 --> 00:27:18,318
Guy was ruining my business.

00:27:18,385 --> 00:27:19,619
So what'd you do?

00:27:19,686 --> 00:27:21,888
I tried to reason
with him.

00:27:21,955 --> 00:27:23,423
( <i>Moses yells</i> )
Hey!

00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,058
Hey, buddy,

00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:27,827
you've got to leave
my customers alone, okay?

00:27:27,894 --> 00:27:31,731
Here.

00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:34,167
Cash that and move on.

00:27:34,234 --> 00:27:35,802
That's the last
I saw of him.

00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:37,237
When was that?

00:27:37,303 --> 00:27:39,506
I don't know,
about two months ago.

00:27:39,572 --> 00:27:40,774
SIDLE:
That's funny

00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,841
we found his body.

00:27:41,908 --> 00:27:43,843
Coroner says he's been dead
two months.

00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:46,012
We're going to want you

00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:47,580
to take a little ride
with us.

00:27:47,647 --> 00:27:50,016
Okay.

00:27:54,354 --> 00:27:56,022
( <i>computer beeping</i> )

00:28:01,861 --> 00:28:04,898
I checked out those kids
you talked to.

00:28:04,964 --> 00:28:07,334
None of them was
even near the school

00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,369
when Barry Schickel
was killed.

00:28:09,436 --> 00:28:11,438
The only one who doesn't
check out is Dennis Fram.

00:28:11,504 --> 00:28:13,173
WILLOWS:
There's a reason.

00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:14,507
I can put him
at the crime scene.

00:28:14,574 --> 00:28:16,009
Jim, can you call them
from the car?

00:28:16,076 --> 00:28:17,510
Sure, let's go.

00:28:17,577 --> 00:28:18,545
Put him there, how?

00:28:18,611 --> 00:28:20,080
Well, I'll explain on the way.

00:28:20,146 --> 00:28:21,247
No, no.

00:28:21,314 --> 00:28:23,650
I'm going to stay here
with this, close to Warrick.

00:28:23,717 --> 00:28:26,953
Okay. But you'll miss
all the fireworks.

00:28:31,658 --> 00:28:34,127
( <i>distant siren blaring</i> )

00:28:34,194 --> 00:28:36,329
I know I must sound
like the typical parent

00:28:36,396 --> 00:28:38,732
but my son had nothing
to do with the death

00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:40,066
of the Schickel boy.

00:28:40,133 --> 00:28:42,168
We've placed him
at the murder.

00:28:42,235 --> 00:28:43,303
What?

00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,071
Here's the fingerprint
that I recovered

00:28:45,138 --> 00:28:47,107
from Dennis' locker.

00:28:47,173 --> 00:28:50,844
These are Dennis' prints
on file at school--

the Missing Kids
Prevention Drive.

00:28:54,648 --> 00:28:56,616
There's a match.

00:28:56,683 --> 00:28:58,718
Well, his own fingerprint
on his own locker

00:28:58,785 --> 00:29:00,153
that doesn't prove anything.

00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,022
Proves a timeline.

00:29:02,088 --> 00:29:03,990
The alkyd particles

00:29:04,057 --> 00:29:08,762
in the victim's spray paint
adhere and dry in 30 seconds.

00:29:08,828 --> 00:29:10,363

00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:13,266
<i>Dennis had to have swiped</i>

00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:15,602
the paint within seconds

00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:19,139
of Barry putting it on his
locker for his print to take.

00:29:19,205 --> 00:29:20,473
Well, how do you know...?

00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,541
The janitor.

00:29:21,608 --> 00:29:23,343
He keeps timed records
of graffiti.

00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,379
Job security.

00:29:26,446 --> 00:29:28,515
And Dennis left paint
on the door jamb

00:29:28,581 --> 00:29:31,051
in the bathroom
where Barry was shot.

00:29:32,986 --> 00:29:34,321

of the murder, Mr. Fram.

We know every move
your son made

00:29:37,691 --> 00:29:38,792
up until the gun.

00:29:38,858 --> 00:29:40,894

It's okay, it's okay.

Come on.

00:29:48,468 --> 00:29:51,504
We'll fix it.

00:29:56,943 --> 00:30:01,381
<i>This...</i> does not belong
in a guy's bathroom.

00:30:01,448 --> 00:30:02,615
Can we prove this?

00:30:02,682 --> 00:30:05,585
I mean, there's got to be
a thousand different brands

00:30:05,652 --> 00:30:06,619
of this stuff out there.

00:30:06,686 --> 00:30:08,722
You still got that $10,000
e-nose you were using?

00:30:08,788 --> 00:30:11,391
Oh, now you want
my tricked-out toy.

00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:13,526
I just want the software.

00:30:18,965 --> 00:30:20,633
Come on, drink up.

00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,901
Here you go.

00:30:21,968 --> 00:30:24,337
Good.

00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,309
Just hold this
to your face, okay?

00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,543
I'll be right back.

00:30:33,813 --> 00:30:36,149
He's got a bleeding ulcer

00:30:36,216 --> 00:30:38,084
from being bullied
by Barry Schickel.

00:30:40,186 --> 00:30:42,489
( <i>grunts</i> )

00:30:42,555 --> 00:30:44,424
Hey, shrimp,
want to go for a ride?

00:30:44,491 --> 00:30:46,092
( <i>laughter</i> )

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,628
You don't know how
hard it was for him

00:30:48,695 --> 00:30:50,196
every morning trying
to work up the courage

00:30:50,263 --> 00:30:51,531
just to go to school.

00:30:51,598 --> 00:30:54,401
( <i>vomiting</i> )

00:30:54,467 --> 00:30:55,335
( <i>coughs</i> )

00:30:58,605 --> 00:31:01,608
I thought my little brother
was going to kill himself.

00:31:01,675 --> 00:31:03,610
And then someone killed Barry.

00:31:05,211 --> 00:31:06,813
Yeah.

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,349
How tall are you?

00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:12,886
Five-four... with heels.

00:31:14,954 --> 00:31:16,256
Why?

00:31:16,323 --> 00:31:19,225
No reason.

00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:21,528
GRISSOM:
You grabbed a top note
of "floral"

00:31:21,594 --> 00:31:24,731
and now we ask the software
to break it into ingredients.

00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:26,766
Do you recognize any of these?

00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:28,935
That's all from
one perfume?

00:31:29,002 --> 00:31:32,238
Some of these perfumes
have, like, 750 ingredients.

00:31:32,305 --> 00:31:35,842
( <i>computer beeping</i> )

00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:37,444
"Chanteuse."

00:31:39,112 --> 00:31:41,314
We can narrow it down
to one brand?

00:31:41,381 --> 00:31:43,416
Yeah, the original application
for this program

00:31:43,483 --> 00:31:44,751
was perfume companies.

00:31:44,818 --> 00:31:47,120
You know,
testing new brands

00:31:47,187 --> 00:31:48,621
stealing from the competition.

00:31:48,688 --> 00:31:50,357
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:31:50,423 --> 00:31:52,125
Grissom.

00:31:52,192 --> 00:31:53,860
Grissom, we got a suspect.

00:31:53,927 --> 00:31:55,695
But it's not who you think.

00:31:55,762 --> 00:31:56,963
Let me guess.

00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,932
Denny Fram's sister?

00:31:58,999 --> 00:32:00,567
How did you know?

00:32:00,633 --> 00:32:02,035
Vapor molecules.

00:32:02,102 --> 00:32:04,170
See if you can get a warrant
for her perfume

00:32:04,237 --> 00:32:05,538
and have Brass bring her in.

00:32:05,605 --> 00:32:07,107
Her perfume?

00:32:07,173 --> 00:32:09,676
Let's get back to my first
question, Miss Fram.

00:32:09,743 --> 00:32:12,512
Where were you the night
Barry Schickel was killed?

00:32:12,579 --> 00:32:16,483
I told you,
I was out driving around.

00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:20,620
So what, your perfume just
wafted into the boys' room

00:32:20,687 --> 00:32:22,322
all the way
from Highway 10?

00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:26,059
Yes. I wear Chanteuse.

00:32:26,126 --> 00:32:28,895
What's that got to
do with anything?

00:32:28,962 --> 00:32:31,798
My mom used to wear it,
and... after

00:32:31,865 --> 00:32:33,333
her car accident

00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,501
I started to wear it.

00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:36,036
Well, aromas have
fingerprints.

00:32:36,102 --> 00:32:38,838
They're like a unique
combination of vapor molecules

00:32:38,905 --> 00:32:41,808
that linger in the air,
long after the source has gone.

00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:44,844
We isolated a combination
in the restroom

00:32:44,911 --> 00:32:47,147
where Barry Schickel was shot.

00:32:47,213 --> 00:32:49,015
It matches your perfume.

00:32:49,082 --> 00:32:50,784
A high-end woman's perfume.

00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:54,487
It's doubtful that any other
girl at the school wears it.

00:32:54,554 --> 00:32:55,488
Wait, wait, wait...

00:32:55,555 --> 00:32:57,590
She has no reason
to hurt Barry Schickel.

00:32:57,657 --> 00:32:59,993
What about revenge
for her little brother?

00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,394
I can't believe this.

00:33:01,461 --> 00:33:04,264
That bastard Schickel
dogged my family

00:33:04,331 --> 00:33:06,766
now he's doing it
from the grave.

00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:09,002
Come on, Kelsey.

00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:10,603
You come near us again

00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,472
you do it
through my lawyer.

00:33:18,044 --> 00:33:21,715
Wears her dead
mother's perfume.

00:33:21,781 --> 00:33:22,882
Nice touch.

00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:25,218
GRISSOM:
Might be true.

00:33:25,285 --> 00:33:26,753
Scent triggers memory
more acutely

00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,088
than any of the five senses.

00:33:28,154 --> 00:33:30,056
Yeah?

00:33:30,123 --> 00:33:34,661
Well, I smell a rat
in the Fram family.

00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,934
So you didn't
hurt him.

00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:41,136
You just put him
in your car.

00:33:41,202 --> 00:33:42,270
Is that what
you're saying?

00:33:42,337 --> 00:33:44,005
Back seat.
Then I drove him out of town.

00:33:44,072 --> 00:33:46,241
I left him on the side
of the road, out by Red Rock.

00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,602
You didn't maybe

00:33:48,668 --> 00:33:50,036
zip him up in a bag

00:33:50,103 --> 00:33:51,738
because he was
giving you trouble

00:33:51,805 --> 00:33:52,906
anything like that?

00:33:52,973 --> 00:33:53,974
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,308
No.

00:33:57,811 --> 00:33:59,179
These...

00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,147
are the handles
from the bag

00:34:01,214 --> 00:34:02,916
that he was found in.

00:34:02,983 --> 00:34:04,317
You see these prints here?

00:34:09,022 --> 00:34:10,991
Can I see your right hand, sir?

00:34:12,025 --> 00:34:13,126
Look, he was drunk.

00:34:13,193 --> 00:34:14,995
He was rolling
all over my backseat.

00:34:15,061 --> 00:34:17,464
So I put him in a
bag from my trunk.

00:34:17,531 --> 00:34:21,201
Once we got out of town,
I just tipped him down the hill.

00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,774
I figured he'd get out

00:34:27,841 --> 00:34:29,409
once he slept it off.

00:34:29,476 --> 00:34:31,333
The guy always shows up.

00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:34,981
What am I looking at?

00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,751
Homicide.

00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:42,027
Look, I was just doing my job.

00:34:42,094 --> 00:34:43,796
Hey...

00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:47,733
treating another human being
like garbage is not a job.

00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,102
It's a choice.

00:34:56,275 --> 00:34:57,750
Paperwork. Later.

00:34:57,817 --> 00:34:59,452
WILLOWS:
Dennis?

00:35:01,554 --> 00:35:03,189
I need to talk to you.

00:35:04,824 --> 00:35:06,259
You have to understand

00:35:06,325 --> 00:35:08,995
anything my sister did
was to protect me.

00:35:09,062 --> 00:35:11,564
You said that you went back
to the high school that night

00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:12,598
after target practice.

00:35:12,665 --> 00:35:15,125
I forgot a book I needed for homework.

00:35:16,035 --> 00:35:18,037
And I knew Barry had been there.

00:35:21,374 --> 00:35:22,909
I wasn't looking for him.

00:35:22,975 --> 00:35:24,711
I had to go to the bathroom.

00:35:30,116 --> 00:35:31,150
( <i>glass breaking</i> )

00:35:38,858 --> 00:35:40,259
My dad's freaking out.

00:35:40,326 --> 00:35:43,229
My sister won't come
out of her room.

00:35:43,296 --> 00:35:46,432
I figure if you can
get the police

00:35:46,499 --> 00:35:48,501
to make some kind
of deal for her...

00:35:49,936 --> 00:35:51,838
Well, Dennis,
you haven't told us

00:35:51,904 --> 00:35:54,807
that you explicitly saw
Kelsey shoot the victim.

00:35:54,874 --> 00:35:56,917
She was in a stall. I couldn't see her.

00:35:57,143 --> 00:35:58,811
BRASS:
Can I, uh...

00:35:58,878 --> 00:36:00,279
Can I talk to you for a minute?

00:36:00,346 --> 00:36:01,948
Excuse us.

00:36:07,553 --> 00:36:09,288
He copping to anything?

00:36:09,355 --> 00:36:11,491
He says that
his sister did it.

00:36:11,557 --> 00:36:13,526
I don't think so.

00:36:13,593 --> 00:36:15,695
Kelsey was "otherwise

00:36:15,762 --> 00:36:17,263
disposed."

00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:18,431
She got a parking ticket

00:36:18,498 --> 00:36:20,533
the same time
the vic was shot

00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,135
in an alley
behind a motel

00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:23,302
off Fremont Street.

00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:27,507
In fact, a lot of cars
got tickets that night.

00:36:30,209 --> 00:36:32,211
Who's Jeremy Spencer?

00:36:32,278 --> 00:36:34,113
Football coach.

00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,715
Oh.

00:36:35,782 --> 00:36:38,117
At a motel
with the high school coach.

00:36:38,184 --> 00:36:40,620
No wonder she wouldn't talk.

00:36:40,687 --> 00:36:42,188
Well, I paid "coach" a visit.

00:36:42,255 --> 00:36:43,756
The guy's 23, just got engaged.

00:36:43,823 --> 00:36:45,158
I mean, he'll testify
to anything

00:36:45,224 --> 00:36:46,826
as long
as his fiancée doesn't find out.

00:36:46,893 --> 00:36:48,528
He says that Kelsey

00:36:48,594 --> 00:36:50,229
gave him a roll in the hay

00:36:50,296 --> 00:36:52,331
asked him to intercede
with Barry-the-bully

00:36:52,398 --> 00:36:54,701
and get the kid to leave
her little brother alone.

00:36:54,767 --> 00:36:57,370
She didn't kill anyone.

00:36:57,437 --> 00:36:59,906
So why is he saying she did?

00:36:59,972 --> 00:37:01,374
Do you ever smell a fart

00:37:01,441 --> 00:37:03,409
and end up
blaming the wrong guy?

00:37:07,947 --> 00:37:10,183
Why do you think your
sister shot Barry?

00:37:10,249 --> 00:37:12,618
Because.

00:37:12,685 --> 00:37:14,821
Because why?

00:37:14,887 --> 00:37:18,491
'Cause of the last time
he beat me up.

00:37:19,592 --> 00:37:23,429
( <i>retching</i> )

00:37:23,496 --> 00:37:25,598
I'll protect you.

00:37:25,665 --> 00:37:29,268
I'll fix things
so he never comes
near you again.

00:37:29,335 --> 00:37:31,471
She always keeps her word.

00:37:31,537 --> 00:37:33,473
She asked Barry's coach
to help you.

00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:35,174
That was her protection plan.

00:37:35,241 --> 00:37:37,877
She was nowhere
near the high
school that night.

00:37:37,944 --> 00:37:39,178
I smelled her perfume.

00:37:39,245 --> 00:37:41,180
<i>I saw Barry.</i>

00:37:41,247 --> 00:37:42,682
<i>I saw the gun.</i>

00:37:42,749 --> 00:37:44,250
<i>And I smelled</i>
<i>my sister's perfume.</i>

00:37:44,317 --> 00:37:46,886
( <i>gunshots</i> )

00:37:46,953 --> 00:37:48,154
No.

00:37:48,221 --> 00:37:51,357
You smelled her <i>brand</i>
of perfume.

00:37:51,424 --> 00:37:53,860
But then who was it?

00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:03,669
We recovered this from
your townhouse on a warrant.

00:38:03,736 --> 00:38:06,706
Chanteuse.

00:38:10,443 --> 00:38:12,145
We also
found the gun.

00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:18,785
It hasn't been cleaned.

00:38:20,586 --> 00:38:23,856
Well, I don't know
how to clean a gun.

00:38:23,923 --> 00:38:25,858
That was my husband's.

00:38:25,925 --> 00:38:28,461
You know how to shoot one,
though.

00:38:28,528 --> 00:38:31,164
Do you know how many kids go
to school and kill

00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:34,634
just to get relief
from the bullying?

00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:36,169
You talked to them.

00:38:36,235 --> 00:38:38,971
Boxing lessons
and target practice.

00:38:39,038 --> 00:38:41,808
How long before one of them
came in here

00:38:41,874 --> 00:38:44,744
and opened fire
on a hallway full of kids, huh?

00:38:46,145 --> 00:38:48,792
I just thought

00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,818
that one life was better
than 20...

00:38:51,884 --> 00:38:54,654
or 30.

00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,485
Or eleven.

00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:07,095
Captain Brass ran a search on you.

00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:10,528
Tetrick High School,
Tetrick, Arizona.

00:39:10,594 --> 00:39:14,164
Eleven kids
shot a few days
after Columbine.

00:39:14,231 --> 00:39:16,233
You were
the Assistant Principal.

00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:24,808
I watched them die at my feet.

00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,779
Just because some sophomore

00:39:28,846 --> 00:39:32,116
couldn't take the jokes
about his glasses.

00:39:34,952 --> 00:39:36,887
It says that you were left

00:39:36,954 --> 00:39:39,056
with Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder.

00:39:39,123 --> 00:39:41,625
You might want to mention that
to your lawyer.

00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:46,430
I did this for my kids.

00:39:46,497 --> 00:39:50,367
You know, Miss Barrett

00:39:50,434 --> 00:39:52,670
as difficult
as high school can be for kids

00:39:52,736 --> 00:39:55,806
eventually, it's over...

00:39:57,775 --> 00:40:00,644
...but too soon
for Barry Schickel.

00:40:17,995 --> 00:40:19,864
( <i>school bell rings</i> )

00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:20,691
Rest in peace, Lieutenant.

00:41:20,758 --> 00:42:26,824
Rest in peace.
