The dove-tail abrasion
of the margins

00:04:58,823 --> 00:05:02,126

of the handle of some weapon.

found the door open.

After that,
he didn't touch a thing.

going back several months.

00:15:20,735 --> 00:15:23,405
A couple of tennis
rackets, a broom

00:15:23,471 --> 00:15:24,873
an umbrella, a pot

00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,009
I guess some kind of
glove or something.

00:15:30,812 --> 00:15:33,415
I stand corrected.

00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:47,929
I have a feeling
whoever owned this cart...

00:15:47,996 --> 00:15:50,198
was an Ashleigh James fan.

00:15:53,435 --> 00:15:55,537
Or a fanatic.

00:16:01,076 --> 00:16:03,011
Well, it looks like

00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:04,579
lover boy isn't home.

00:16:04,646 --> 00:16:07,082
Maybe he wrote her a
letter and left town.

00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:10,685
It's trash day.

00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:11,686
I don't know, man.

00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:13,188
We don't even have a warrant.

00:16:13,255 --> 00:16:14,990
It's on the street.

00:16:15,056 --> 00:16:16,258
It's fair game.

00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:42,684
What did you find?

00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,753
Photographic paper.

00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,170
That's Ashleigh James.

00:17:15,317 --> 00:17:17,319
( <i>camera shutters clicking</i> )

00:17:18,587 --> 00:17:20,188
The cow says moo.

00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:21,857
I can hold my
breath, I swear.

00:17:21,923 --> 00:17:24,292
Lola, if you exhale,
you'll burst the bloody seams.

00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,394
Rod, I'm sorry. I...

00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:28,029
The fitting was two days ago.

00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:29,030
Are you telling me

00:17:29,097 --> 00:17:31,566
you couldn't keep your face
out of the trough

00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,934
for 48 hours?

00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:34,569
You want me to be your agent

00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,438
you better start doing
your part, all right?

00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:39,341
Rod Darling?

00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:42,010
Las Vegas Police.

00:17:42,077 --> 00:17:44,079
You're here
about Ashleigh, right?

00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:45,080
Yeah.

00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,515
Sorry about
what happened

00:17:46,581 --> 00:17:47,716
but she wasn't
a client anymore.

00:17:47,782 --> 00:17:49,117
I dropped her a
couple of months ago.

00:17:49,184 --> 00:17:50,485
Did you forget to pack?

00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,290
We found men's clothing
and personal items at her place.

00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:57,993
She was a screwed up kid
looking for a father figure.

00:17:58,059 --> 00:17:59,361
One minute

00:17:59,427 --> 00:18:00,629
booking a photo shoot.

00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:03,131
The next minute,
she's screaming for Daddy.

00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:06,868
( <i>grunts</i> )

00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:07,802
You son of a bitch!

00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:08,970
All right, that's enough.

00:18:09,037 --> 00:18:09,804
He killed her.

00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:11,540
He killed her!

00:18:11,606 --> 00:18:12,841
You're a psycho!

00:18:14,643 --> 00:18:16,845
Rod did everything he could

00:18:16,912 --> 00:18:20,315
to make her dependent on him
and only him.

00:18:20,382 --> 00:18:22,050
She shut me out.

00:18:22,117 --> 00:18:23,552
Is that why you

00:18:23,618 --> 00:18:25,987
tore up her photograph

00:18:26,054 --> 00:18:27,389
and tossed it in the trash?

00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,257
You just don't get it, do you?

00:18:29,324 --> 00:18:30,659
No, I don't.

00:18:30,725 --> 00:18:31,827
I mean, I don't know.

00:18:31,893 --> 00:18:34,196
I care about a woman,
I put her picture in a frame.

00:18:34,262 --> 00:18:35,397
Maybe put it on my desk

00:18:35,463 --> 00:18:38,333
but to tear it
up and throw it
in the garbage

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,568
with old cole slaw

00:18:39,634 --> 00:18:41,303
that just doesn't say "love"
to me.

00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:45,040
If you were in love
with an amazing woman

00:18:45,106 --> 00:18:47,042
and you knew

00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:50,245
she was throwing away everything
that was amazing about her

00:18:50,312 --> 00:18:53,081
on some scum...

00:18:53,148 --> 00:18:56,918
would you still want her picture
on your desk?

00:18:56,985 --> 00:18:58,753
What did you use
to cut up the picture?

00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,989
Same knife you
were waving
around at Rod?

00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,859
The same knife you used
to cut up Ashleigh's face?

00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,661
If you're suggesting

00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,597
I was sleeping with her,
I wasn't.

00:19:08,663 --> 00:19:10,899
You run out of drawer space
in your place?

00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:12,868
I was protecting my asset.

00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:15,604
I don't know what that means.

00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,605
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:19:16,671 --> 00:19:18,373
You can't drive a mile
in this town

00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,308
without seeing her face
on a billboard

00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,409
on the side of a bus.

00:19:21,476 --> 00:19:22,577
Up in lights.

00:19:22,644 --> 00:19:24,980
The mantra in
this business

00:19:25,046 --> 00:19:28,416
is you protect what's bankable
in this business.

00:19:28,483 --> 00:19:29,618
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:19:29,684 --> 00:19:31,119
So you didn't sleep with her.

00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:32,287
You just "stayed over."

00:19:32,354 --> 00:19:33,922
You brought a change of clothes

00:19:33,989 --> 00:19:36,057
razor blade, toothbrush,
blah, blah, blah.

00:19:36,124 --> 00:19:37,225
Yeah.

00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:39,561
She needed constant attention,
supervision.

00:19:39,628 --> 00:19:43,165
Leave her alone for a minute,
fill in the blank.

00:19:47,302 --> 00:19:49,571
I got crabs.

00:19:49,638 --> 00:19:51,573
Excuse me?

00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,741
I got crabs.

00:19:52,807 --> 00:19:55,076
Take a look.

00:19:59,848 --> 00:20:00,949
Pthirus pubis.

00:20:01,016 --> 00:20:02,751
Feeds on human blood.

00:20:02,818 --> 00:20:05,253
They prefer the pubic
and perianal regions

00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,988
because their
legs are adapted

00:20:07,055 --> 00:20:09,257
to grasp hairs which
are widely spaced.

00:20:09,324 --> 00:20:11,359
They don't usually
nest in clothing.

00:20:11,426 --> 00:20:13,395
But when the clothing
is being worn

00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:15,997
by someone with substandard
personal hygiene...

00:20:16,064 --> 00:20:18,300
Like one
of the victim's neighbors.

00:20:18,366 --> 00:20:19,968
We have a high-end handbag
found

00:20:20,035 --> 00:20:21,736
in a street person's
shopping cart

00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,104
a jacket covered in crabs

00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:25,040
in a closet full
of designer clothes.

00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:26,308
What does that tell us?

00:20:26,374 --> 00:20:28,510
Tells me the victim not only
had a visitor

00:20:28,577 --> 00:20:30,712
but that visitor was
most likely homeless.

00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:32,914
Tells me that whoever is missing
a shopping cart

00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,150
is also missing his jacket.

00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:05,213
Good stuff in here.

00:21:06,648 --> 00:21:09,284
Hey, you got a smoke?

00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,286
No. Sorry.

00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,022
So, what good
are you?

00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,559
It depends.

00:21:17,626 --> 00:21:19,327
Ooh, hey.

00:21:19,394 --> 00:21:23,198
Don't even think
that you can play me, my man.

00:21:23,265 --> 00:21:25,267
I'm not playing.

00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,370
I've got a gal named Sara,
and she would love that scarf.

00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,706
What do you say?

00:21:31,773 --> 00:21:34,543
Trade me.

00:21:35,577 --> 00:21:37,345
Yeah. What the hell.

00:21:46,822 --> 00:21:48,757
Hey.

00:21:48,824 --> 00:21:50,325
Hey, hey, Mister.

00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,793
Hey, Mister, that
is Tookie's scarf.

00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,261
That is his scarf.
I gave it to him.

00:21:53,328 --> 00:21:54,296
That is Tookie's.

00:21:54,362 --> 00:21:56,164
Are you a taker, or are
you a giver, Mister?

00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,432
I'm a trader.

00:21:57,499 --> 00:22:00,602
I traded Tookie my jacket
for this scarf.

00:22:02,037 --> 00:22:04,339
Yeah, and fleas can tell time.

00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,041
I think fleas <i>can</i> tell time.

00:22:06,107 --> 00:22:07,976
( <i>muttering</i> )

00:22:09,444 --> 00:22:11,112
That's a nice ring.

00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:14,349
I'll trade you.

00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:20,518
I'll trade you for kit, too.

00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,427
Now I can see
what the dark looks like.

00:22:30,494 --> 00:22:33,063
I've been trying
to do that for years.

00:22:41,105 --> 00:22:43,007
Greg ran the blood
on this scarf.

00:22:43,073 --> 00:22:44,441
It matches the victim's.

00:22:44,508 --> 00:22:45,843
How about the blood
on the knife?

00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,878
Yeah, we got a
match, too, but

00:22:47,945 --> 00:22:49,280
it's not the vic's.

00:22:49,346 --> 00:22:50,581
BROWN:
Yeah, Mcbride

00:22:50,648 --> 00:22:53,484
clipped Rod Darling's right hand
during his little hissy fit.

00:22:53,551 --> 00:22:54,952
Blood's his.

00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:59,356
And Mcbride's knife does not
match these wounds.

00:23:00,991 --> 00:23:03,627
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:23:03,694 --> 00:23:07,431
The tools were trade.
The weapons of beauty.

00:23:07,498 --> 00:23:09,700
Yeah. If other people inflicted
as much torture

00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:11,268
as women inflict upon themselves

00:23:11,335 --> 00:23:12,470
there would be lawsuits.

00:23:12,536 --> 00:23:16,273
Someone forgot to clean these,
too, for a long time.

00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,175
Positive for blood
all over the place.

00:23:22,746 --> 00:23:25,049
SANDERS:
Grissom...

00:23:25,116 --> 00:23:26,283
I, uh, ran the DNA

00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:29,687
on the epithelials
from the homeless lady's ring.

00:23:29,753 --> 00:23:31,989
It's like <i>Prince</i>
<i>and the Pauper.</i>

00:23:32,056 --> 00:23:33,491
No. <i>Princess and the Pauper.</i>

00:23:33,557 --> 00:23:35,359
The princess is
a dead supermodel.

00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:36,560
Yeah.

00:23:36,627 --> 00:23:39,630
And her pauper sister could
be the killer.

00:23:41,232 --> 00:23:43,501
Hot dog?

00:23:49,406 --> 00:23:51,308
Relish?

00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:55,412
Mm... with all those
preservatives, no, no, no.

00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:59,316
I-I don't want to be preserved,
thank you very much. No.

00:23:59,383 --> 00:24:00,551
I mean, I mean
do you know

00:24:00,618 --> 00:24:02,753
what-what relish
can do to your
insides, huh?

00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,522
I'd have to investigate.

00:24:04,588 --> 00:24:06,157
Yeah, well, you know,
you should.

00:24:06,223 --> 00:24:07,158
I mean, you know

00:24:07,224 --> 00:24:09,493
because our insides--
they can kill us.

00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,962
So, you're pretty careful
about what you eat?

00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:14,565
Yeah, you know,
you-you have to be
careful, you know

00:24:14,632 --> 00:24:16,167
'cause what goes
down, you know

00:24:16,233 --> 00:24:17,601
it's got to come out.

00:24:17,668 --> 00:24:19,003
It's got to come up.

00:24:19,069 --> 00:24:20,337
Out.

00:24:20,404 --> 00:24:21,705
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:24:21,772 --> 00:24:23,974
Newton's theory twisted again.

00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:26,043
Everybody's twisted.

00:24:29,647 --> 00:24:31,582
How about your sister?

00:24:31,649 --> 00:24:33,751
My-my sister didn't
have a sister.

00:24:33,818 --> 00:24:35,186
Protein's good,
you know?

00:24:35,252 --> 00:24:36,487
C-carbs are bad.

00:24:36,554 --> 00:24:37,755
This is bad.

00:24:37,822 --> 00:24:38,989
That's bad.

00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:46,997
Hey, Cassie, you know that scarf
you gave Tookie?

00:24:47,064 --> 00:24:49,800
Yeah, I know it.

00:24:49,867 --> 00:24:52,570
Did your sister give that
to you, or...

00:24:52,636 --> 00:24:54,572
did you steal it from her?

00:24:54,638 --> 00:24:58,209
I should have stole it.

00:24:58,275 --> 00:25:01,979
Because sh-sh-she stole from me.

00:25:02,046 --> 00:25:04,515
What did she steal from you?

00:25:04,582 --> 00:25:08,385
My life.

00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:15,561
DARLING:
I admit I gave up on Cassie.

00:25:15,628 --> 00:25:16,896
Washed my hands.

00:25:16,962 --> 00:25:19,598
Ashleigh was the only one
who still gave a damn.

00:25:19,665 --> 00:25:22,067
Get together with her
every couple of weeks.

00:25:22,134 --> 00:25:25,538
Make sure she had a decent meal,
shower, clothes on her back.

00:25:25,604 --> 00:25:26,906
And what did
you do for her?

00:25:26,972 --> 00:25:28,274
Let me tell you something.

00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,910
For every piece of meat,
there has to be a butcher.

( <i>scoffs</i> )

00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:33,913
So, you led her
to the slaughter?

00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:34,914
Free will.

00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,650
Recognize this one?

00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:42,436
That's Cassie.

00:25:42,503 --> 00:25:44,739
It's the homeless sister.

00:25:44,805 --> 00:25:47,275
How long ago
was this taken?

00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:48,376
Three years.

00:25:48,442 --> 00:25:50,845
See, Cassie got deep
into freebase.

00:25:50,911 --> 00:25:54,715
No shortage of sleazebags around
to keep her supplied.

00:25:54,782 --> 00:25:57,718
I knew she had the sister
in Wichita Falls.

00:25:57,785 --> 00:25:58,886
All right, Cassie,
let's go.

00:25:58,953 --> 00:26:00,187
Come on, chin up.

00:26:00,254 --> 00:26:01,956
Colin, will you get in
there and get her hair

00:26:02,023 --> 00:26:02,990
out of her face?

00:26:03,057 --> 00:26:04,091
Don't touch me!

00:26:04,158 --> 00:26:06,060
I hate this!

00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:07,194
I hate this place!

00:26:07,261 --> 00:26:08,195
I hate it!

00:26:08,262 --> 00:26:09,196
I hate my life!

00:26:09,263 --> 00:26:10,298
Get away from me!

00:26:10,364 --> 00:26:12,066
( <i>muttering</i> )

00:26:19,473 --> 00:26:23,110
One look... that was it.

00:26:23,177 --> 00:26:25,813
Camera ate her up.

00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,482
So, in Cassie's mind,
she was a victim here.

00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:30,584
Makes sense that she'd be angry.

00:26:30,651 --> 00:26:32,019
Angry was five flights up.

00:26:32,086 --> 00:26:33,821
Cassie was an obsessed basehead.

00:26:33,888 --> 00:26:35,623
Cocaine already
had her paranoid.

00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,592
Once Ashleigh
started modeling

00:26:37,658 --> 00:26:40,161
everything became
this big conspiracy.

00:26:40,227 --> 00:26:43,064
Naturally,
yours truly was Satan.

00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,832
Cassie threw her life away

00:26:44,899 --> 00:26:47,268
and her sister Ashleigh
recycled it.

00:26:47,335 --> 00:26:49,637
GRISSOM:
It's like a crossword
puzzle, isn't it?

00:26:49,704 --> 00:26:51,706
Once you pick it up,
you can't put it down.

00:26:51,772 --> 00:26:53,374
And go home? No way.

00:26:53,441 --> 00:26:56,043
You know, this Day Runner
belonged to Ashleigh.

00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,511
"BFJ3".

00:26:57,578 --> 00:26:59,947
BF: Bellagio fountain.

00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:05,152
J3? Date?

00:27:05,219 --> 00:27:07,655
January 3rd?
June 3rd? July 3rd?

00:27:07,722 --> 00:27:09,824
Uh, third "J" month, July?

00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,759
That's what I
thought at first.

00:27:11,826 --> 00:27:13,995
Parking space
in a parking garage?

00:27:14,061 --> 00:27:17,265
Nope. Once you pick it up,
you can't put it down.

00:27:17,331 --> 00:27:19,100
J3... J3...

00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:20,468
City or state grid map?

00:27:20,534 --> 00:27:22,503
You're cold.

00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:25,306
What's one thing
a model always knows?

00:27:26,507 --> 00:27:27,508
Who's shooting her.

00:27:27,575 --> 00:27:28,776
Three Js. Jay Jay Jarrett.

00:27:28,843 --> 00:27:30,011
Who?

00:27:30,077 --> 00:27:31,345
Famous photographer.

Compliments of P.D.:

Ashleigh James's
employment contracts
for the last year.

00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:36,951
And, as an aside

00:27:37,018 --> 00:27:38,653
she stopped working
two months ago.

00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:40,321
Why?

00:27:40,388 --> 00:27:42,523
Good question.

00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,858
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:27:43,925 --> 00:27:46,861
Maybe the answer is in
one of these pages.

00:27:51,866 --> 00:27:55,503
BRASS:
Nobody could blame you
for being mad, Cassie.

00:27:55,569 --> 00:27:58,139
I mean, your sister took
your career

00:27:58,205 --> 00:28:00,641
and you wanted to get back
at her.

00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:03,311
If you couldn't have success,
she couldn't either.

00:28:03,377 --> 00:28:04,412
Isn't that right?

00:28:04,478 --> 00:28:08,082
The v-victims have victims, too.

00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:10,518
So, which one of you
is the victim?

00:28:10,584 --> 00:28:14,855
I-I know... you know,
I know, I tried to warn her.

00:28:14,922 --> 00:28:16,424
About the in-in

00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,992

and the pick-pick.

and the counting

I mean, I did, I tried.

00:28:22,029 --> 00:28:24,198
That's why I tried to really,
really save her.

00:28:24,265 --> 00:28:25,600
I mean, I tried to save her.

00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:26,834
You tried to save her?

00:28:26,901 --> 00:28:27,835
Your sister?

00:28:27,902 --> 00:28:29,503
Right. She could
never be, you know...

00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,872
she could never be...
pretty enough.

00:28:31,939 --> 00:28:35,743
And she could never

00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,279
And sh-she could never be...

00:28:38,346 --> 00:28:41,048
And sh-she could never be

Hey, fat girl.

I got what you need.

She doesn't know

Yes, she does.

I found blisters in
the back of her throat.

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,662
What? Forced oral?

00:30:01,729 --> 00:30:03,264
That's what I thought

00:30:03,331 --> 00:30:07,969
until I noticed worn
enamel on the tooth.

In conjunction
with this red mark

00:30:10,538 --> 00:30:12,907
on the knuckle
of her middle finger.

00:30:12,974 --> 00:30:16,644
Which made me realize
it wasn't sexual abuse.

00:30:16,711 --> 00:30:19,180
Eating disorder.

( <i>gagging sound</i> )

00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,453
She was bulimic and anorexic.

00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,489
Which explains
the down on her skin.

00:30:28,556 --> 00:30:30,725
Lanugo.

00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:34,095
Characteristic of premature
babies and anorexics.

00:30:34,161 --> 00:30:36,998
She doesn't seem that skinny.

who knows?

00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:43,004
Binge-and-purge.

00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,473
Till her entire system
is in a state of shock.

00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:46,641
You know what's next.

00:30:46,707 --> 00:30:48,676
Body starts feeding
on its own muscle.

00:30:48,743 --> 00:30:50,011
Is that what killed her?

00:30:50,077 --> 00:30:54,615
Uh, starvation and purging
weaken the immune system.

00:30:54,682 --> 00:30:59,520
But cause of death: failed
kidney, fueled by septicemia.

00:30:59,587 --> 00:31:01,188
Blood infection.

00:31:01,255 --> 00:31:04,825
Caused by the injuries
to her face?

00:31:04,892 --> 00:31:07,828
Probably, but she's been septic
for at least a month.

00:31:07,895 --> 00:31:10,097
She has anemia
borne of chronic disease.

00:31:10,164 --> 00:31:12,199
Her red cell count's low,
iron's low.

00:31:12,266 --> 00:31:14,402
ESR is extremely high.

00:31:14,468 --> 00:31:17,004
So she didn't just die.

00:31:44,189 --> 00:31:45,324
schizophrenic.

00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:47,326
Which explains why
the interrogation room

00:31:47,392 --> 00:31:48,794
was too hard on her.

00:31:48,861 --> 00:31:51,663
For schizophrenics,
you know, the tighter the space

00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,665
the more unbearable
the feelings tend to be.

00:31:53,732 --> 00:31:55,000
Well, if you ask me

00:31:55,067 --> 00:31:57,169
that's not the only

Definitely lacking
in the self-image department.

She suffered from septicemia,
indicative of chronic abuse.

But...
what if Cassie

00:32:10,582 --> 00:32:13,886

Another psychological--

that people with extreme sexual

their feelings

00:35:17,002 --> 00:35:18,770
Or your skin,
or your hair

00:35:18,837 --> 00:35:21,373
or that zit
on your forehead.

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,674
I knew this dancer.

00:35:22,741 --> 00:35:26,111
Every night she'd stare
at herself in the mirror
for three hours.

00:35:26,178 --> 00:35:28,981
Meticulous grooming,
when a person suffers from BDD

00:35:29,047 --> 00:35:31,083
becomes
a destructive compulsion.

00:35:31,149 --> 00:35:32,885
There's one line
in her daybook

00:35:32,951 --> 00:35:34,920
that keeps repeating
over and over

00:35:34,987 --> 00:35:37,422
and over again: "I'm not even."

00:35:37,489 --> 00:35:40,058
So you're saying she knew
she was slipping.

00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:42,861
No. She literally means even.

00:35:42,928 --> 00:35:44,530
A large number of BDD sufferers

00:35:44,596 --> 00:35:46,698
are convinced that
they're not symmetric.

00:35:46,765 --> 00:35:48,467
That one side of their body
or their face

00:35:48,534 --> 00:35:49,568
doesn't match the other.

00:35:49,635 --> 00:35:51,803
All animals prefer symmetry
in their mates.

00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:55,173
The male Japanese scorpion flies
with the most symmetrical wings

00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,441
gets the most mates.

00:35:56,508 --> 00:35:58,076
BROWN:
So, really

00:35:58,143 --> 00:36:00,078
we're not talking about
being beautiful at all.

00:36:00,145 --> 00:36:01,146
In terms of entomology

00:36:01,213 --> 00:36:02,915
being beautiful
is about being even.

00:36:02,981 --> 00:36:05,484
It signals the fitness
to procreate.

00:36:05,551 --> 00:36:07,653
STOKES:
So, we're not really
talking about looks.

00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:10,489
We're talking about
survival of the species?

00:36:10,556 --> 00:36:12,057
The bottom line
is the same:

00:36:12,124 --> 00:36:14,293
control and perfectionism.

00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:16,361
That's what her
code was all about.

00:36:19,698 --> 00:36:28,106
Let's take "HBWC/3, 1590 BC,
90 BF, 3930 S, 114 TC."

00:36:28,173 --> 00:36:30,108
Three hamburgers with cheese.

00:36:30,175 --> 00:36:31,343
<i>Content 530.</i>

00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:33,245
<i>530 times three</i>

00:36:33,312 --> 00:36:35,681
is where she gets 1590 BC.

00:36:35,747 --> 00:36:38,450
That's BC for "bad calories."

00:36:38,517 --> 00:36:40,519
And at 30 grams a pop

00:36:40,586 --> 00:36:42,120
90 grams of BF.

00:36:42,187 --> 00:36:43,288
Bad fat?

00:36:43,355 --> 00:36:44,623
Yeah.

00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:46,058
The rest of her formula

00:36:46,124 --> 00:36:48,260
involves sodium,
total carbohydrates

00:36:48,327 --> 00:36:50,963
and the actual weight
of everything she ate.

00:36:51,029 --> 00:36:53,232
And so,
she was, uh...

00:36:53,298 --> 00:36:54,900
operating like a scientist

00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:57,870
seeking a perfect formula
to take her pain away.

00:36:57,936 --> 00:37:00,205
Or disappear altogether.

00:37:00,272 --> 00:37:02,908
Which brings me to
the minus side of her equation.

00:37:02,975 --> 00:37:05,010
She would write down
the number of times

00:37:05,077 --> 00:37:08,780
she t'u'd, threw up,
in this case twice-- or evo'd.

00:37:08,847 --> 00:37:10,148
"Evo'd"?

00:37:10,215 --> 00:37:12,351
Moving her bowels.

00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:14,319
The directions
on her disposable enema box

00:37:14,386 --> 00:37:15,487
use the term "evacuate".

00:37:15,554 --> 00:37:18,323
So, after
her burger binge

00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:22,861
she "3 evo'd, 14 G,
2 t'u'd, 9 G, 3 #1."

00:37:22,928 --> 00:37:24,663
She evo'd three times

00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:27,065
but her calculations
didn't stop there.

00:37:27,132 --> 00:37:29,902
"G" stands for grams.

00:37:36,141 --> 00:37:37,709
14 gram... wait a minute.

00:37:37,776 --> 00:37:39,945
You're telling me
that she weighed her bowel?

00:37:40,012 --> 00:37:41,113
WILLOWS:
Yeah.

00:37:41,179 --> 00:37:43,749
We bagged it.

00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:49,054
SIDLE:
Input and output

00:37:49,121 --> 00:37:51,223
down to the last quarter gram.

00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:53,592
Well, that makes sense
why the blood and skin

00:37:53,659 --> 00:37:56,395
under Ashleigh James's
fingernails is a perfect match

00:37:56,461 --> 00:37:57,696
to Ashleigh James.

00:37:57,763 --> 00:37:59,264
She attacked herself.

00:38:00,832 --> 00:38:02,534
<i>I mean, Ashleigh was convinced</i>

00:38:02,601 --> 00:38:05,237
<i>that everything about her</i>
<i>needed to be fixed.</i>

00:38:05,304 --> 00:38:07,039
<i>The real problem</i>
<i>was inside her head.</i>

00:38:07,105 --> 00:38:08,307
<i>She couldn't deal with that</i>

00:38:08,373 --> 00:38:09,775
so she tried to fix the outside.

00:38:09,841 --> 00:38:13,111
<i>Hence, the digging and picking</i>
<i>and purging and bleeding.</i>

00:38:13,178 --> 00:38:14,813
To us, it would be torture.

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,784
To her... some sort of release.

00:38:18,851 --> 00:38:22,588
Which is why Rod cut her loose.

00:38:22,654 --> 00:38:24,756
She was no longer bankable.

00:38:24,823 --> 00:38:27,960
Also why Frank was so angry
at Rod.

00:38:28,026 --> 00:38:30,529
Yeah, he destroyed
Frank's vision of her.

00:38:30,596 --> 00:38:34,132
So the victim and the killer
became one and the same.

00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:36,869
The very nature
of addiction--

00:38:36,935 --> 00:38:39,371
whether it be self-medicating
herself or self-mutilating--

00:38:39,438 --> 00:38:41,440
is that the very behavior
we use to survive it

00:38:41,506 --> 00:38:43,375
becomes a behavior
that ends up killing us.

00:38:43,442 --> 00:38:46,378
STOKES:
But wait, that
still doesn't answer

00:38:46,445 --> 00:38:50,916
how Ashleigh ended up in
a shopping cart by the freeway.

00:38:50,983 --> 00:38:53,685
Well, the fingerprints
explain that.

00:39:08,667 --> 00:39:10,669
( <i>crying</i> )

00:39:14,706 --> 00:39:17,943
I think Cassie was trying
to take care of her sister.

00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,478
She pushed her
to a place

00:39:19,545 --> 00:39:21,480
where she thought
she'd be safe.

00:39:21,547 --> 00:39:24,416
Where she thought
she could see herself

00:39:24,483 --> 00:39:26,985
for how beautiful
she really was.

00:39:35,994 --> 00:39:38,063
What happened to these girls?

00:39:48,307 --> 00:39:52,144
I'm sorry about your sister,
Cassie.

00:39:52,211 --> 00:39:54,546
The dead don't bleed.

00:39:54,613 --> 00:39:58,317
True. Death does have
some advantages.

00:40:00,252 --> 00:40:02,521
Would you like me to help you
get into a shelter?

00:40:02,588 --> 00:40:04,623
No, I would need a shelter
from a shelter.

00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:07,359
No, no, no. Out here,
I can hunt and I can range

00:40:07,426 --> 00:40:08,861
and I can find the things

00:40:08,927 --> 00:40:10,896
that I need
out here.

00:40:10,963 --> 00:40:13,799
I mean, you never know
what you need until you find it.

00:40:13,866 --> 00:40:16,168
Or until you lose it.

00:40:19,238 --> 00:40:23,141
I mean, all we are
is what we try
to get rid of.

00:40:23,208 --> 00:40:25,544
Fat and newspapers

00:40:25,611 --> 00:40:27,546
and loneliness
and cat food cans.

00:40:27,613 --> 00:40:30,916
And there are going-away people
and there are left-behind people

00:40:30,983 --> 00:40:32,851
but, you know,
everybody's secrets...

00:40:32,918 --> 00:40:34,586
everybody's secrets
are the same.

00:40:34,653 --> 00:40:36,955
Were you and your sister's
secrets the same?

00:40:37,022 --> 00:40:38,557
My sister didn't
have secrets.

00:40:38,624 --> 00:40:40,025
Her secrets had her.

00:40:40,092 --> 00:40:43,228
That... I told you I didn't...
I don't know.

00:40:43,295 --> 00:40:46,431
I mean, you know, y-y-you-you
can pick through a million lives

00:40:46,498 --> 00:40:48,634
and never have one of your own.

00:40:51,537 --> 00:40:56,108
Looking for things,
analyzing them...

00:40:56,174 --> 00:41:00,112
trying to figure out the world--
that's a life.

00:41:00,178 --> 00:41:03,749
You never know what you
need until you find it.

00:41:03,815 --> 00:41:05,250
And the next thing I find

00:41:05,317 --> 00:41:09,288
it might be the thing
that changes everything.

00:41:09,354 --> 00:41:13,192
What will you do
when you find it?

00:41:13,258 --> 00:41:16,195
Sleep...

00:41:16,261 --> 00:41:19,731
the most perfect sleep.

00:41:22,601 --> 00:41:25,604
( <i>muttering</i> )

00:42:22,027 --> 00:42:22,995
( <i>muted tires screeching</i> )

00:42:23,061 --> 00:42:24,897
( <i>muted horn honking</i> )

00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:38,176
GRISSOM:
<i>Obviously most of crime scene</i>
<i>investigation is about seeing.</i>

00:42:38,243 --> 00:42:40,979
<i>But much of it</i>
<i>is about hearing as well.</i>

00:42:41,046 --> 00:42:42,314
<i>Listening.</i>

00:42:42,381 --> 00:42:43,749
<i>Knowing how to listen.</i>

00:42:43,815 --> 00:42:45,951
<i>Not just to what people</i>
<i>are saying</i>

00:42:46,018 --> 00:42:47,286
<i>but how they say it.</i>

00:42:47,352 --> 00:42:51,123
<i>How their tone of voice matches</i>
their facial expressions

00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:53,392
<i>or body posture.</i>

00:42:53,458 --> 00:42:58,697
<i>So, even if I read lips</i>
<i>and know what they're</i>
<i>saying...</i>

00:42:58,764 --> 00:43:01,567
<i>it's not enough.</i>

00:43:02,401 --> 00:43:04,736
We're both scientists,
Mr. Grissom

00:43:04,803 --> 00:43:06,939
so let me tell you
the science.

00:43:07,005 --> 00:43:09,975
You've got otosclerosis.

00:43:10,042 --> 00:43:12,144
Basically, this means
a bony growth

00:43:12,211 --> 00:43:15,147
has begun to form around
the base of the stapes.

00:43:15,214 --> 00:43:18,250
What this does
is prevent the stapes
from moving

00:43:18,317 --> 00:43:20,853
and passing vibrations
to the inner ear

00:43:20,919 --> 00:43:25,390
effectively neutralizing
sound waves.

00:43:25,457 --> 00:43:27,893
It's hereditary--
my mother.

00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,428
Most doctors think so.

00:43:29,494 --> 00:43:32,965
But there's no way to know
when it's going to show up

00:43:33,031 --> 00:43:36,702
and there's no way to reverse it
once it does.

00:43:36,768 --> 00:43:38,237
Right.

00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,876
How long do you think?

00:43:45,944 --> 00:43:47,880
I don't have that answer.
