to the right.

Newton's Third Law:
"For every action

00:07:16,925 --> 00:07:18,994
there is an equal
and opposite reaction."

Suspension to frame.

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,603
And the lower radius rod arm...

00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,106
which connects
the axle to the frame.

00:07:31,172 --> 00:07:33,975
Not anymore.

00:07:36,645 --> 00:07:39,748

going to make things worse.

Putting pressure
on the right front tire

SANDERS:
Oh, I feel bad.

00:10:29,904 --> 00:10:31,583
I just
froze up.

00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,186
That's why we have
fielding training, Greg.

00:10:34,252 --> 00:10:37,622
No disrespect, but you're
not qualified to be out here.

00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:41,560
I guess I just wasn't
expecting blood
to look like that.

00:10:41,626 --> 00:10:43,662
Pre-collection,
so different.

00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:44,996
Yup.

00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:46,965
I remember my first
time in the field.

00:10:47,032 --> 00:10:48,033
CSI One.

00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:49,868
Green as could be.

00:10:49,935 --> 00:10:51,703
Initial call was a robbery.

00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,605
I get there,
triple homicide.

00:10:53,672 --> 00:10:56,675
Blood all over the place,
mother and two kids.

00:10:56,741 --> 00:10:58,643
How do you deal?

00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,445
You just do.

00:11:04,216 --> 00:11:06,718
Okay, what's next?

00:11:06,785 --> 00:11:08,787
Well, we're missing
a passenger.

00:11:08,854 --> 00:11:12,824
The only one unaccounted for is
an ex-con named Calvin McBride.

00:11:12,891 --> 00:11:15,126
According to Brass, he wasn't
admitted to the hospital

00:11:15,193 --> 00:11:16,728
and he's not in any
of the body bags.

00:11:16,795 --> 00:11:18,396
What about the rest
stop in Barstow?

00:11:18,463 --> 00:11:20,465
CHP and the Barstow PD
are looking.

00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:24,002
Anybody check the bus?

00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,343
I'll find out.

00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:06,211
Firefighters only look
in the obvious spots.

00:12:08,813 --> 00:12:12,517
Just out of curiosity, what
are the <i>unobvious</i> spots?

00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:14,486
For bodies?

00:12:14,552 --> 00:12:18,256
Walls, hot water heaters

00:12:18,323 --> 00:12:21,083
stuffed in the box spring
of a hotel room bed.

00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,519
I found a head
in a bucket of paint once.

00:12:24,553 --> 00:12:26,555
I get the picture.

00:12:34,863 --> 00:12:36,331
What do you see?

00:12:36,398 --> 00:12:39,034
Well...

00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:41,837
McBride's not on the bus.

00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,395
Grissom.

00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:08,597
Cheap whiskey

00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:11,400
broken bottle, brown paper bag.

00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:15,971
You know, I never gave
the bus driver a breath test.

00:13:19,107 --> 00:13:20,108
Greg

00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,778
bag this, take it
to the lab

00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,947
swab the rim for DNA.

00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,052
You should be wearing gloves.

00:13:31,987 --> 00:13:33,422
Sorry.

00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:39,428
This guy was in 1C.

00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,338
Seat 1C was the only seat

00:13:49,404 --> 00:13:52,474
with an unobstructed path
through the windshield.

00:14:02,985 --> 00:14:04,853
Where's the other half
of this windshield?

00:14:23,872 --> 00:14:26,875
STOKES:
Laminated safety glass,
pops in, pops out.

00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:43,258
Hello,
Mr. McBride.

00:14:45,294 --> 00:14:48,730
I'm afraid our ex-con
just got the death penalty.

00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,703
WILLOWS:
He's one of the victims
in the bus crash.

00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,038
He was in the Camaro.

00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,673
He was driving the Camaro.

00:14:57,739 --> 00:14:58,740
Excuse me.

00:14:58,807 --> 00:15:00,142
Ma'am,
not now.

00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:02,010
Catherine Willows
with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:15:02,077 --> 00:15:03,178
This will just take a second.

00:15:03,245 --> 00:15:04,213
Can you tell me
your name?

00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,881
Eric.
Eric?

00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:09,051
I just wanted to surprise her.
That's all.

00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,285
If I don't make it

00:15:10,352 --> 00:15:12,054
please tell her
I'm sorry.

00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,589
Ma'am, this is
the operating room.

00:15:13,655 --> 00:15:14,656
You need to leave.

00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,965
GRISSOM:
I need the two front wheels,
axle, suspension, all of it.

00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:25,200
The whole front undercarriage.

00:15:35,777 --> 00:15:37,446
Excuse me, Miss.

00:15:37,513 --> 00:15:38,881
This is
a crime scene.

00:15:38,947 --> 00:15:39,982
It's off limits.

00:15:40,048 --> 00:15:41,216
I know.

00:15:41,283 --> 00:15:43,852
I was, uh,
I was on the bus.

00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,458
Why are you here?

00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,629
I don't...

00:15:53,695 --> 00:15:55,464
I don't know.

00:16:00,202 --> 00:16:01,637
I'm sorry.

00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:08,010
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:16:22,324 --> 00:16:24,693
Shreds of rubber everywhere.

00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,029
Between the crash, and all
the other interstate traffic

00:16:27,095 --> 00:16:28,630
it might as well be
the Indy 500.

00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,465
This stuff could be
from any vehicle.

00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:34,369
There's no doubt that this bus
body-checked this K-Rail.

00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,192
( <i>tires squealing</i> )

00:17:19,848 --> 00:17:21,917
You've got that "Sara" look.

00:17:21,984 --> 00:17:24,319
You mean that "Grissom" look?

00:17:24,386 --> 00:17:27,055
Second set
of skid marks.

00:17:27,122 --> 00:17:28,724
Camaro.

00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,359
I got a theory.

00:17:31,827 --> 00:17:34,897
Grissom said the suspension
gave on the bus, right?

00:17:34,963 --> 00:17:37,065
Broken rod arm.

00:17:37,132 --> 00:17:38,400
Well,
I'm thinking

00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:41,003
when that rod arm
hit the pavement

00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:42,738
it made this great
first impression here.

00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,412
If this is the bus...

00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:52,314
the bus begins
to slide right.

00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:53,682
Driver overcorrects.

00:17:55,551 --> 00:17:57,753
Crosses the highway

00:17:57,819 --> 00:17:59,221
slams into the K-Rail.

00:18:01,156 --> 00:18:02,291
Meanwhile

00:18:02,357 --> 00:18:04,960
the Camaro's holding
steady in the right lane

00:18:05,027 --> 00:18:06,395
heading straight
for us.

00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,297
Bus bounces off
this K-Rail...

00:18:09,865 --> 00:18:11,533
heads back towards us.

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,902
Taking out anything
in its path.

00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,540
Bus crosses four
lanes of traffic

00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:20,742
and only takes out
the car behind it?

00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:24,546
Someone upstairs was
looking out big-time.

00:18:29,852 --> 00:18:30,986
Hey, boss.

00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:34,456
I had a feeling
you were coming.

00:18:34,523 --> 00:18:36,391
I ran the DNA
on that whiskey bottle.

00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,426
You'll never guess.

00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:38,460
It's not the bus driver

00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:40,929
but I do have an answer
behind door number two.

00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:42,297
Seat number 1C.

00:18:42,364 --> 00:18:44,132
Calvin McBride.

00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:45,767
He's an ex-con.
Found his DNA in CODIS.

00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,636
Good, Greg.

00:18:49,805 --> 00:18:51,306
Did you enjoy
being in the field?

00:18:51,373 --> 00:18:53,442
You heard about it, too?

00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:55,143
What?

00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,979
That I...

00:18:57,045 --> 00:18:58,981
messed up.

00:18:59,047 --> 00:19:00,516
No.

00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,952
Well, then I enjoyed it fine.

00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,893
You're telling me
this guy <i>wasn't</i> intoxicated.

00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,961
Not a drop of ethanol
in his system

00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:14,496
not even
from cough syrup.

00:19:14,563 --> 00:19:16,298
He could barely
put a sentence together.

00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:18,000
If he wasn't drunk,
then what was he?

00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:19,134
My guess, hungry.

00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,569
Driver's medical eval

00:19:20,636 --> 00:19:22,504
taken just
last month.

00:19:22,571 --> 00:19:25,107
Martin Draper, 40.

00:19:25,174 --> 00:19:26,175
Overweight.

00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:27,743
One of 15 million
people

00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:30,412
in this country suffering
from Type II diabetes.

00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:31,747
On any medication?

00:19:31,813 --> 00:19:34,216
Primary course of treatment
would have been exercise

00:19:34,283 --> 00:19:35,984
and weight loss
to lower blood sugar.

00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,986
Doesn't look like
he was hitting the gym.

00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,421
But he was
dieting.

00:19:39,488 --> 00:19:40,422
Crash dieting.

00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:41,256
Didn't find

00:19:41,323 --> 00:19:42,424
any food in
his stomach.

00:19:42,491 --> 00:19:43,458
Means he
hadn't eaten

00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:45,661
anything in at least six hours.

00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,996
An empty stomach
invites hypoglycemia.

00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:50,766
Symptoms of which can
mirror intoxication.

00:19:50,832 --> 00:19:52,768
And in extreme cases?

00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:56,038
Loss of consciousness
and seizure.

00:19:56,104 --> 00:19:57,105
Do I pass?

00:19:57,172 --> 00:19:58,407
Cum laude.

00:19:58,473 --> 00:19:59,508
Cause of death?

00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:00,709
Just what you'd expect.

00:20:00,776 --> 00:20:02,511
Massive injuries,
internal bleeding.

00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:04,479
So, if we're not looking
at the driver...

00:20:04,546 --> 00:20:06,715
We're looking at the bus.

00:20:32,374 --> 00:20:33,709
Check this out.

00:20:37,412 --> 00:20:38,480
A bolt?

00:20:38,547 --> 00:20:39,848
Nice.

00:20:39,915 --> 00:20:41,049
I got 20 of them.

00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:43,151
Well, this one's sheared.

00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:46,455
It is, isn't it?

00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:18,520
Bus company just faxed over
a maintenance report.

00:21:18,587 --> 00:21:20,489
Bus was in
perfect working order.

00:21:20,556 --> 00:21:21,790
Serviced last week.

00:21:23,292 --> 00:21:25,827
Does this look like it's
in perfect working order?

00:21:25,894 --> 00:21:28,697
Uh... no.

00:21:28,764 --> 00:21:30,432
What'd you get?

00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:31,867
Three-quarter
inch bolt.

00:21:31,934 --> 00:21:34,636
It matches the bolt
on the specs for this
suspension system.

00:21:34,703 --> 00:21:36,438
The hex head says
it's a grade eight.

00:21:40,275 --> 00:21:41,743
Snapped in half?

00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,012
Bolts are graded according
to their hardness.

00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:46,315
The higher the grade,
the stronger the steel.

00:21:46,381 --> 00:21:48,650
STOKES:
A grade eight bolt shouldn't
snap like a toothpick.

00:21:48,717 --> 00:21:50,085
Did you do a Rockwell
Hardness test?

00:21:50,152 --> 00:21:51,353
Yeah,
I hit it with the Tru-Blue.

00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,088
It's not a grade eight.
It's a grade five.

00:22:02,464 --> 00:22:04,933
Often when there's one...

00:22:07,336 --> 00:22:08,804
there's another one.

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,942
Bus company
was using bogus bolts.

00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:16,879
Inferior bolts would cause
the suspension to give

00:22:16,945 --> 00:22:18,580
the bus veers off the road.

00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:20,115
If the sheared bolts

00:22:20,182 --> 00:22:21,416
were the first
action.

00:22:21,483 --> 00:22:24,920
No, the bolts snapped
midway through the skid

00:22:24,987 --> 00:22:26,855
after the bus hit the K-Rail.

00:22:26,922 --> 00:22:27,956
Proof?

00:22:28,023 --> 00:22:29,558
The gouge in the road.

00:22:32,928 --> 00:22:35,163
Broken rod arm,
maybe?

00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,632
Okay.

00:22:36,698 --> 00:22:38,967
Driver hits the brakes,
initiates the skid.

00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:41,870
Why'd he hit the brakes?

00:22:41,937 --> 00:22:42,871
Another vehicle.

00:22:42,938 --> 00:22:44,673
Nope, only two sets
of fresh skid marks

00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,941
on that stretch
of highway.

00:22:46,008 --> 00:22:49,645
And the Camaro's skid marks
place it behind the bus.

00:22:49,711 --> 00:22:51,180
So I ask again--

00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:52,548
why'd he hit the brakes?

00:22:52,614 --> 00:22:53,582
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:22:53,649 --> 00:22:55,350
Man, there could be
a million reasons.

00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:58,153
Well, fortunately,
we're just looking for one.

00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,769
The kid in the Camaro
didn't make it.

00:23:12,837 --> 00:23:14,405
Eric Kevlin, 32.

00:23:14,472 --> 00:23:16,540
He was a resident
at the UCLA Med Center.

00:23:16,607 --> 00:23:19,443
He was on his way to Vegas
to surprise his girlfriend.

00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:22,413
Only to end up
pinned under a bus.

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,682
But he's rescued.

00:23:24,749 --> 00:23:27,752
Given a second chance on life.

00:23:27,818 --> 00:23:30,421
And, uh... he signs this.

00:23:33,124 --> 00:23:34,625
It's a pre-op DNR.

00:23:34,692 --> 00:23:36,927
BRASS:
"Do not resuscitate"?

00:23:36,994 --> 00:23:39,597
It doesn't make sense
for a young person.

00:23:39,663 --> 00:23:41,208
Why refuse CPR?

00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:45,477
MADDOX:
Our company has
an excellent safety record.

00:23:45,544 --> 00:23:46,583
BROWN:
Until last night.

00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:48,333
Look, you own an airline
or a bus company--

00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,602
any transport business--
accidents are inevitable.

00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:52,583
Criminal acts, however,
are another matter.

00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:53,125
Wait a minute.

00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:53,959
I've got a family.

00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:55,160
Sometimes they ride my buses.

00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:57,563
I don't take a chance with
their lives or anybody else's.

00:23:57,629 --> 00:23:58,630
I screen all
my drivers.

00:23:58,697 --> 00:24:00,917
Zero tolerance for
drugs or alcohol.

00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:02,500
I keep strict
maintenance records.

00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,542
Vehicle inspection every 45 days
as required by law.

00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:07,375
You're not going to find
anything criminal here.

00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:10,611
I believe this belongs to you.

00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:14,577
Bolt, grade eight.

00:24:14,644 --> 00:24:16,445
Sheared.

00:24:16,512 --> 00:24:17,680
It doesn't happen.

00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,782
The front suspension
was riddled with these.

00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,885
We have more questions
about the accident

00:24:22,952 --> 00:24:23,953
but one thing we know.

00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,254
The suspension didn't hold.

00:24:25,321 --> 00:24:28,090
I buy all my spare parts
from reputable companies.

00:24:28,157 --> 00:24:29,692
We only care about the bolts.

00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,661
Brillway Bolt Company.

00:24:31,727 --> 00:24:33,963
I just switched;
they were low bid.

00:24:35,364 --> 00:24:37,266
The consequences
of saving a buck.

00:24:38,734 --> 00:24:40,603
I think maybe it's time
for another inspection.

00:24:42,371 --> 00:24:44,340
I'll ground
the fleet.

00:25:33,956 --> 00:25:35,258
I get it.

00:25:35,324 --> 00:25:36,726
It's busy here
in Barstow.

00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:38,728
But you do remember the bus?

00:25:38,794 --> 00:25:40,329
Yeah, I knew the driver.
Marty.

00:25:40,396 --> 00:25:42,365
Always fill him up
on the return trip.

00:25:42,431 --> 00:25:45,067
I remember this one guy
kept checking me out.

00:25:45,134 --> 00:25:46,802
Bought a lot
of turkey jerky.

00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:49,538
Oh, and this one couple
was having a fight.

00:25:49,605 --> 00:25:51,774
Did, uh, did they
come off the bus?

00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,009
I don't know.

00:25:53,075 --> 00:25:54,911
But you do remember
the bus?

00:25:54,977 --> 00:25:56,012
Of course.

00:25:56,078 --> 00:25:57,146
Mojave Express.

00:25:57,213 --> 00:25:58,247
Always on time.

00:25:58,314 --> 00:26:00,249
Ten-minute rest stop,
right back on the road.

00:26:00,316 --> 00:26:02,084
Did you see a couple arguing?

00:26:02,151 --> 00:26:04,887
No. But it was really busy.

00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:44,500
Hey, Nick.

00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:48,118
We making
any progress?

00:26:48,185 --> 00:26:50,420
Just this jacket so far.

00:26:50,487 --> 00:26:52,723
Passenger seat. And you?

00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:55,392
We checked Kevlin's property
at the hospital.

00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:56,460
There's no wallet.

00:26:56,526 --> 00:26:59,529
Guy drives from L.A.
four and a half hours--

00:26:59,596 --> 00:27:01,798
I got an idea.

00:27:01,865 --> 00:27:03,667
( <i>grunts</i> )

00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:06,637
Hand me that, uh, crowbar
there, please.

00:27:09,473 --> 00:27:11,341
Thank you.

00:27:17,781 --> 00:27:19,416
Ha.

00:27:19,483 --> 00:27:20,651
Bingo.

00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,589
I always take mine out.

00:27:25,656 --> 00:27:26,990
Pain in the ass.

00:27:27,057 --> 00:27:29,226
Literally.

00:27:29,293 --> 00:27:31,228
Yeah, that's him.

00:27:31,295 --> 00:27:34,031
Yeah.

00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:38,235
Nice-looking girl.

00:27:38,302 --> 00:27:40,270
Wait.

00:27:42,372 --> 00:27:43,507
I've seen her.

00:27:45,642 --> 00:27:49,012
Yeah. Yeah, I've seen her.

00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:51,648
She was in
the accident.

00:27:51,715 --> 00:27:54,284
He said he wanted
to surprise you.

00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,121
He did.

00:27:58,188 --> 00:28:00,657
In Barstow at the rest stop.

00:28:00,724 --> 00:28:04,194
It was supposed to be
a girls' weekend.

00:28:05,395 --> 00:28:07,631
No! This is my weekend.

00:28:07,698 --> 00:28:10,434
If this is
going to work,
I need my space.

00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,135
I don't want
to lose you.

00:28:12,202 --> 00:28:13,437
Then go back home.

00:28:13,503 --> 00:28:16,607
I saw him pull out.

00:28:16,673 --> 00:28:18,308
Drive off.

00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:21,311
Well, he didn't
drive back to L.A.

00:28:21,378 --> 00:28:24,214
I wish I hadn't yelled at him.

00:28:27,784 --> 00:28:30,721
Is there any reason why Eric,
in a medical crisis

00:28:30,787 --> 00:28:32,422
would refuse resuscitation?

00:28:32,489 --> 00:28:34,224
What are you talking about?

00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:38,262
He consented
to lifesaving surgery, but...

00:28:38,328 --> 00:28:40,063
signed a DNR.

00:28:41,698 --> 00:28:43,433
Oh, God.

00:28:46,303 --> 00:28:49,039
It's because he was a doctor.

00:28:49,106 --> 00:28:51,008
He saw it every day.

00:28:51,074 --> 00:28:55,212
People hooked up to machines
waiting to die.

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,348
He swore he wouldn't let
anyone he loved

00:28:58,415 --> 00:28:59,683
go through that.

00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,518
And if his life was at stake

00:29:01,585 --> 00:29:03,720
he wanted to make
the hard decision

00:29:03,787 --> 00:29:05,722
so no one else would have to.

00:29:40,891 --> 00:29:44,361
I thought I told you
I'd page you with the results.

00:29:44,428 --> 00:29:46,096
I know. I want to wait.

00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:54,805
Greg?

00:29:54,871 --> 00:29:57,074
You're really good
at what you do.

00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:09,843
Sabotage.

00:30:22,055 --> 00:30:24,157
Grissom.

00:30:24,224 --> 00:30:26,359
I finally know
the first action.

00:30:26,426 --> 00:30:27,861
What initiated the skid.

00:30:27,928 --> 00:30:30,497
The right front tire
started to come apart.

00:30:30,564 --> 00:30:33,833
When it blew, it left
an indentation in the pavement.

00:30:35,535 --> 00:30:36,703
I didn't see it.

00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,171
You and me both.

00:30:38,238 --> 00:30:40,974
Treads from the right rear tire
obscured it.

00:30:44,044 --> 00:30:46,379
So, the driver overcorrects

00:30:46,446 --> 00:30:47,647
but since
there's no more tire

00:30:47,714 --> 00:30:49,983
all that force is displaced
on the suspension system.

00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,285
The bolt snaps,
the rod arm breaks

00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:54,688
and the bus
broadsides the Camaro.

00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:01,194
But why did the tire come apart
in the first place?

00:31:03,163 --> 00:31:04,764
I don't know.

00:31:04,831 --> 00:31:05,899
I do.

00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:09,836
Chloroform. Inside the tire.

00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:20,146
Newton's Third... with a twist.

00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,917
Yeah, the front right tire
was compromised.

00:31:23,917 --> 00:31:24,917
I found
chloroform

00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:26,417
in the interior
fragments of
the rubber.

00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,752
Oh, that's original.
What happened to
slashing tires?

00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:29,787
It wasn't vandalism.

00:31:29,853 --> 00:31:31,155
It was an act
of premeditation.

00:31:31,221 --> 00:31:32,189
Why chloroform?

00:31:32,256 --> 00:31:34,124
Chloroform destroys the
elasticity of the rubber.

00:31:34,191 --> 00:31:35,459
Sooner or later,
the air pressure

00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:36,894
inside the tire
causes it to explode.

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,895
How much later?

00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:39,930
Well, that's what
we're going to find out.

00:31:39,997 --> 00:31:41,565
We need a treadmill--
a big one.

00:31:41,632 --> 00:31:42,566
All right,
to do what?

00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:43,567
Exercise a bus.

00:31:43,634 --> 00:31:45,002
Warrick, tell Larry Maddox

00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,571
it's in his best interest
to lend us one of his.

00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:50,641
Set it up in the empty police
warehouse next door. Sara?

00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:54,445
Yeah, I'll be at Trace.
They're going to love this.

00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:59,183
Chloroform
in the tire?

00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:03,354
Yeah. Weird, huh?
So, where are we?

00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,389
Body count jumped to nine dead.

00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:06,557
Sabrina Wright

00:32:06,623 --> 00:32:08,158
law student, 7-B.

00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:09,693
Pronounced an hour ago.

00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,262
23 passengers,
plus the driver.

00:32:12,329 --> 00:32:15,766
WILLOWS:
Whoever tampered with that tire
was playing Russian roulette

00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:16,867
with people's lives.

00:32:16,934 --> 00:32:19,003
GRISSOM:
Or maybe one of them
was a target.

00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:22,239
Hmm.... Gwen Murray, 1-B...

00:32:22,306 --> 00:32:25,242
was unemployed,
but was clearing a bundle

00:32:25,309 --> 00:32:26,276
in alimony.

00:32:26,343 --> 00:32:28,245
Also got the Porsche
and the vacation home.

00:32:28,312 --> 00:32:30,114
Michael Goodman,
10-C

00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:33,384
was picked up a couple times
by vice for making fake IDs.

00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,552
Ryan Hyde, a
money manager

00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:38,222
in 4-C, filed
bankruptcy last year

00:32:38,288 --> 00:32:40,457
but carried a hefty
life insurance policy.

00:32:40,524 --> 00:32:41,692
I mean, I could go on.

00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:42,693
Right.

00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,994
You look hard enough

00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:45,763
everybody's got
a skeleton.

00:32:48,065 --> 00:32:50,668
What was her skeleton?

00:32:50,734 --> 00:32:52,369
Tracey Logan?

00:32:52,436 --> 00:32:54,505
Seat 8-B?

00:32:54,571 --> 00:32:56,407
Her boyfriend
was Eric Kevlin

00:32:56,473 --> 00:32:57,675
the Camaro driver.

00:32:57,741 --> 00:32:58,676
He was a doctor.

00:32:58,742 --> 00:33:00,044
He followed her
from L.A.

00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,912
They had an argument
in Barstow.

00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:03,547
He didn't want her
in Vegas.

00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:06,350
First step to stopping her
is stopping the bus.

00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,686
And he has access to chloroform.

00:33:08,752 --> 00:33:11,889
Chloroform can be picked up
at any chemical supply store.

00:33:11,955 --> 00:33:12,890
Wait a minute.

00:33:12,956 --> 00:33:15,225
Eric Kevlin was a
nervous boyfriend.

00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:16,694
He wasn't a criminal.

00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:21,365
Still possible.
Motive, access, opportunity.

00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,634
His car should be towed in
by now.

00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:27,304
I'll check for residue.

00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:31,141
So, who do you like?

00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:32,409
The bus company.

00:33:32,476 --> 00:33:35,179
Larry Maddox--
he talks a good game

00:33:35,245 --> 00:33:37,915
but, uh, he cheaped out
on his supplies

00:33:37,981 --> 00:33:40,150
and he's been way too helpful.

00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,635
You busy?

00:33:49,701 --> 00:33:52,638
I got three minutes
and, uh, five seconds.

00:33:52,704 --> 00:33:54,006
Then I have
a question for you.

00:33:54,072 --> 00:33:55,007
Bus case?

00:33:55,073 --> 00:33:56,275
Uh-huh.

00:33:56,341 --> 00:33:58,777
I heard Sanders
broke out of here, fared poorly

00:33:58,844 --> 00:33:59,945
and disgraced us all.

00:34:00,012 --> 00:34:02,214
No, he didn't.

00:34:02,281 --> 00:34:03,849
( <i>monitor beeps</i> )

00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,484
Listen, I-I found chloroform

00:34:05,551 --> 00:34:07,653
on the inside
of a steel-belted radial

00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:08,720
and I need to know

00:34:08,787 --> 00:34:10,455
how it got there.

00:34:10,522 --> 00:34:13,492
You ever hear the expression
"pissing up a rope"?

00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:16,361
Not in a scientific context, no.

00:34:16,428 --> 00:34:18,864
Well, I don't know
if you <i>can</i> urinate

00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:19,865
up a rope

00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,466
but you can urinate
against a rope

00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:23,468
and the urine will dribble down.

00:34:23,535 --> 00:34:24,903
Answer your
question?

00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:27,406
Yes.

00:34:27,472 --> 00:34:29,174
You know we need
to document this

00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:31,710
for <i>The Journal</i>
<i>of Forensic Science,</i> right?

00:34:33,745 --> 00:34:34,913
Is this the twin?

00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,482
Yeah, this is the rear trailing
tire of the crash bus.

00:34:37,549 --> 00:34:39,117
It has the same
maintenance record

00:34:39,184 --> 00:34:40,185
as the tire
that blew.

00:34:40,252 --> 00:34:42,721
Chloroform, glass rod

00:34:42,788 --> 00:34:45,390
valve core remover....

00:34:45,457 --> 00:34:48,026
According to Vincent and Trace

00:34:48,093 --> 00:34:49,895
it's like pissing
down a rope.

00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,863
Gravity, huh?

00:35:08,914 --> 00:35:10,983
Reattach the valve...

00:35:15,587 --> 00:35:17,256
reinflate the tire...

00:35:18,857 --> 00:35:20,826
( <i>air hissing</i> )

00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,103
...and you're done.

00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:32,371
Minute, minute and a half

00:35:32,437 --> 00:35:35,574
tops.

00:35:35,641 --> 00:35:37,075
Did you see that?

00:35:37,142 --> 00:35:39,144
Yeah.

00:35:39,211 --> 00:35:41,446
You used your left hand
to prop yourself up.

00:35:41,513 --> 00:35:45,384
The perp may have
done the same.

00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,052
Yeah, I'm going to go dust
that right rim.

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,320
I'll see you guys.

00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:55,494
Okay. "Drive," he said.
Just the speed limit.

00:35:58,997 --> 00:36:01,600
( <i>motor whirring</i> )

00:36:30,862 --> 00:36:32,564
( <i>computer beeping</i> )

00:36:52,885 --> 00:36:56,989
( <i>cell phone ringing</i> )

00:36:57,055 --> 00:36:58,657
Warrick.

00:36:58,724 --> 00:36:59,658
Okay.

00:36:59,725 --> 00:37:02,160
Yeah, okay.

00:37:02,227 --> 00:37:03,762
I'll be there.

00:37:05,631 --> 00:37:08,867
Sara. She's at the print lab.

00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:10,936
She needs me.

00:37:15,641 --> 00:37:17,676
Checkmate.

00:37:29,321 --> 00:37:30,856
Print off the rim

00:37:30,923 --> 00:37:33,225
matched a work card
on file-- a Sean Nolan.

00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:36,194
So, why are you
paging me?

00:37:36,261 --> 00:37:38,497
I pulled up his DMV
records looking
for an address.

00:37:38,564 --> 00:37:40,299
I found one, not recent, but...

00:37:40,365 --> 00:37:42,868
he's got a Class B license
with passenger endorsement.

00:37:42,935 --> 00:37:45,737
WARRICK:
Oh... so he can drive

00:37:45,804 --> 00:37:47,673
a vehicle
with over ten passengers.

00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:49,500
I cross-checked his name
with the employee roster

00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,701
from Mojave Express.
Mm-hmm?

00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,702
He's a driver.

00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:56,069
Well, I guess
I'll grab a uniform

00:37:56,135 --> 00:37:59,038
and pay Mr. Maddox
another visit.

00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:05,708
Bus logged into Barstow
at 8:03 p.m.

00:38:05,708 --> 00:38:07,041
target would be
two hours later.

00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:08,917
No, if the tire was
tampered with in Barstow

00:38:08,917 --> 00:38:10,319
it should blow
any minute.

00:38:10,385 --> 00:38:12,988
If not, it was
sabotaged in L.A.

00:38:13,055 --> 00:38:14,957
and we've got another
two hours and 13 minutes.

00:38:17,326 --> 00:38:20,596
Hello.

00:38:20,662 --> 00:38:22,664
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:38:30,472 --> 00:38:31,740
( <i>explosion</i> )

00:38:31,807 --> 00:38:33,475
( <i>motor stops</i> )

00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:35,410
Cool.

00:38:35,477 --> 00:38:37,713
Well, I guess
it's Barstow.

00:38:37,779 --> 00:38:40,249
Listen

00:38:40,315 --> 00:38:41,783
I scanned Eric
Kevlin's car

00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,318
and clothing
with an ion detector.

00:38:43,385 --> 00:38:45,053
There was no chloroform.
He was clean.

00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,655
And I got a hit
off that print--

00:38:46,722 --> 00:38:49,024
a Sean Nolan,
employed by Mojave Express.

00:38:49,091 --> 00:38:50,759
Any chance
he was

00:38:50,826 --> 00:38:51,960
in Barstow yesterday?

00:38:52,027 --> 00:38:55,230
Uh, his route is...
Vegas/Grand Canyon

00:38:55,297 --> 00:38:57,165
but I'll call Warrick.

00:38:57,232 --> 00:38:59,167
He's on his way
to the bus company right now.

00:38:59,234 --> 00:39:01,937
You know, if this guy Nolan
worked for the bus company

00:39:02,004 --> 00:39:03,939
his print on the wheel
could be legit.

00:39:04,006 --> 00:39:06,875
Well, I wish we had a "who"

00:39:06,942 --> 00:39:10,312
but at least we have a "where."

00:39:10,379 --> 00:39:11,680
I have a zero
tolerance policy.

00:39:11,747 --> 00:39:14,016
I found marijuana
in Mr. Nolan's locker.

00:39:14,082 --> 00:39:16,018
He was out of here
that afternoon.

00:39:16,084 --> 00:39:17,586
Well, we're still going
to need

00:39:17,653 --> 00:39:18,987
those maintenance records.

00:39:19,054 --> 00:39:21,023
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:39:21,089 --> 00:39:22,591
( <i>machinery whirring</i> )

00:39:24,893 --> 00:39:27,863
Everything from fill-ups
to tune-ups the last six months.

00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,765
Thank you.

00:39:32,568 --> 00:39:34,870
There were security cameras
behind the counter

00:39:34,937 --> 00:39:36,905
but none of them were
pointed out here.

00:39:36,972 --> 00:39:39,174
Five buses have pulled in
in the last ten minutes.

00:39:39,241 --> 00:39:41,043
Not to mention all
the private vehicles

00:39:41,109 --> 00:39:43,212
truckers-- nothing's changed
since I was here yesterday.

00:39:43,278 --> 00:39:45,047
Forget about getting
a usable print

00:39:45,113 --> 00:39:46,815
off that airhose.

00:39:46,882 --> 00:39:48,817
BRASS:
Yeah, a guy putting air
in a tire at a rest stop

00:39:48,884 --> 00:39:50,552
does not draw
attention.

00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:52,187
( <i>cell phone rings)</i>
Grissom.

00:39:52,254 --> 00:39:54,423
Sean Nolan was fired
two months ago.

00:39:54,489 --> 00:39:56,725
Maddox says he's working
in Barstow

00:39:56,792 --> 00:40:00,062
and since then three
of Maddox's buses had blowouts.

00:40:00,128 --> 00:40:02,030
They all went through Barstow.

00:40:02,097 --> 00:40:04,199
Did you check
their maintenance records?

00:40:04,266 --> 00:40:06,735
Yeah, only last night's bus
had been serviced

00:40:06,802 --> 00:40:08,537
since Maddox changed suppliers.

00:40:08,604 --> 00:40:10,339
Way to go, Warrick. I owe you.

00:40:10,405 --> 00:40:11,340
Yeah, you do.

00:40:11,406 --> 00:40:12,674
See you.

00:40:12,741 --> 00:40:15,544
We got a suspect.

00:40:15,611 --> 00:40:17,479
Sean Nolan.

00:40:26,955 --> 00:40:29,091
BRASS:
Sean Nolan?

00:40:29,157 --> 00:40:30,325
Can I help you?

00:40:30,392 --> 00:40:33,462
Yeah, there was a bus crash
up the road.

00:40:33,529 --> 00:40:35,030
About nine people died.

00:40:35,097 --> 00:40:37,399
Yeah, it's all
over the news.

00:40:37,466 --> 00:40:38,534
I already talked to him.

00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,968
I forgot what you told me.

00:40:40,035 --> 00:40:41,537
Wasn't much to tell.

00:40:41,603 --> 00:40:43,472
Your prints were
on the bus.

00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:45,574
Not following.

00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:47,776
Front right wheel hub.

00:40:47,843 --> 00:40:48,977
I work here.

00:40:49,044 --> 00:40:51,547
Julius Caesar,
murdered in 44 B.C.

00:40:51,613 --> 00:40:54,416
Legend has it
that the molecules
from his last breath

00:40:54,483 --> 00:40:55,817
spread all over
the world.

00:40:55,884 --> 00:40:58,186
Probably like
your fingerprints, right?

00:40:58,253 --> 00:40:59,288
They're everywhere.

00:40:59,354 --> 00:41:00,422
WILLOWS:
Uh...

00:41:00,489 --> 00:41:02,958
Mr. Nolan, have you handled
any chloroform lately?

00:41:03,025 --> 00:41:05,427
No.

00:41:05,494 --> 00:41:07,729
You mind?

00:41:07,796 --> 00:41:09,431
( <i>slow beeping</i> )

00:41:09,498 --> 00:41:11,166
What are you doing?

00:41:11,233 --> 00:41:12,801
Would you turn
around, please?

00:41:15,204 --> 00:41:16,638
( <i>rapid beeping</i> )

00:41:17,906 --> 00:41:18,874
( <i>steady beeping</i> )

00:41:18,941 --> 00:41:19,975
GRISSOM:
Whoa.

00:41:20,042 --> 00:41:21,243
Is that a pickle
in your pocket

00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,611
or are you just
happy to see us?

00:41:22,678 --> 00:41:24,980
( <i>steady beep</i> )

00:41:36,658 --> 00:41:40,829
Just wanted to stick it to him.
Give him a few problems.

00:41:40,896 --> 00:41:42,564
Maddox?

00:41:42,631 --> 00:41:45,334
Yeah.

00:41:47,169 --> 00:41:50,072
I smoke one joint
on the weekend... my time.

00:41:50,138 --> 00:41:51,707
Now I got a jacket as a junkie.

00:41:53,575 --> 00:41:56,111
Can't get a job driving a bus
to save my life.

00:41:56,178 --> 00:42:00,415
So, you figured, "I'll just
blow a couple of his tires."

00:42:00,482 --> 00:42:01,583
Even if a tire blows

00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:04,186
the suspension system
should keep the bus on the road.

00:42:04,253 --> 00:42:07,022
I been driving buses
for ten years.

00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:09,525
I've never seen a flat
take out a bus.

00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:12,094
There's always a first time.

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,029
You're under arrest.

00:42:21,703 --> 00:42:24,506
I didn't mean to hurt anyone,
okay?

00:42:27,509 --> 00:42:30,646
Well, I'd hate to be a juror
on a case like this.

00:42:30,712 --> 00:42:31,813
Second-degree murder.

00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,484
Reckless disregard
for safety and human life

00:42:35,551 --> 00:42:37,486
mitigated by bad bolts.

00:42:37,553 --> 00:42:40,222
Yeah, which was mitigated
by greed.

00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:45,661
MAN:
<i>Folks, we're going to take</i>
<i>a quick 15-minute pit stop.</i>

00:42:45,727 --> 00:42:47,829
<i>We're about 45 minutes</i>
<i>outside of Las Vegas.</i>

00:42:47,896 --> 00:42:49,431
<i>We'll be back on the bus</i>
<i>in a jiffy</i>
