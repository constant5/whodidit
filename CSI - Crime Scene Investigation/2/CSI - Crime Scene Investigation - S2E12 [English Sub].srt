00:00:30,454 --> 00:00:31,246
Come on, Gunner.

00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:33,694
Let's go.

00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,192
(Horse whinnies)

00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:38,819
What is wrong with you?

00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,948
Easy.

00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:56,005
(Horse whinnies)

00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,719
(Helicopter whirs)

00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:11,988
Girl in a culvert pipe
at a highway construction site...

00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:14,908
in the middle of an alfalfa field.

00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:21,204
You got anything to add?

00:01:21,338 --> 00:01:23,331
Nothing as poetic.

00:01:23,465 --> 00:01:26,217
Just... Road crew took off at 3 o'clock.

00:01:26,343 --> 00:01:28,336
Body was discovered at 5:15.

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,048
Who found the body?

00:01:31,034 --> 00:01:33,276
Our friend Flicka.

00:01:33,412 --> 00:01:34,867
Well, there goes that theory.

00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:38,699
- What's that?
- Whoever finds the body is the first suspect.

00:01:38,834 --> 00:01:41,503
Grissom!

00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,542
What you got?

00:01:48,677 --> 00:01:51,346
The one thing you don't want
at a murder scene.

00:01:56,242 --> 00:01:57,825
A second body.

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,853
Who would you like to start with?

00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,980
Which one died first?

00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:37,522
Identical body temps in vitreous humour.

00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:40,695
Both women died approximately 12 hours ago.

00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:44,162
My Uncle Phil used to say
you can't kill two birds with one stone.

00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,330
All I can tell you is cause of death.

00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:48,701
Injury to the cervical spine.

00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,829
Looks to be hands-on.

00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:57,087
Somebody snapped her neck.

00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,762
She died instantly.

00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:00,881
Now the blonde.

00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:05,012
Contusion to the forehead. Not fatal.

00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:07,137
Whatever cut her face, cut her arm.

00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:11,020
I found glass in all the incised wounds.
Except...

00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,439
for these abrasions on her neck.

00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,025
Fingernails, maybe?

00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:17,650
Possible sign of struggle.

00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:21,447
I swabbed the abrasions for foreign DNA.
Sent it to the lab.

00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:23,155
Cause of death?

00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,861
Severed brachial artery. She bled out.

00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,998
Something doesn't seem right.

00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,871
The brunette.

00:03:33,006 --> 00:03:34,500
Elaborate tattoos.

00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:37,467
Perfectly dyed hair.

00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:44,672
Multiple body piercings.

00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,886
Tells me she craved attention.

00:03:48,021 --> 00:03:50,013
- Sure.
- The blonde, however...

00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,894
...seems almost prosaic.

00:03:56,029 --> 00:03:58,816
She doesn't even nave pierced ears

00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:05,360
She didn't shave her legs.

00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:11,040
A wild flower and a wallflower.

00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:13,161
So, besides time of death,

00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:16,213
what do our dead flowers have in common?

00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:25,132
(Owl hoots)

00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:32,410
Found his SUV in the turnout after closing,

00:04:32,537 --> 00:04:34,530
so I scoped out the area.

00:04:34,664 --> 00:04:36,657
He should have been wearing his orange vest.

00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,163
Bullet looks like a through-and-through.

00:04:40,712 --> 00:04:42,503
He bled out.

00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,588
Hunting rifle.

00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,752
Winchester 70.

00:04:51,806 --> 00:04:54,760
- What are you doing there?
- Checking liver temperature.

00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:57,016
Estimating time of death

00:04:59,773 --> 00:05:02,442
Should be a total of five bullets.

00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:07,353
Four in the magazine. One in the chamber.

00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:09,944
All accounted for.

00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:11,984
This rifle was never fired

00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:18,744
88.6. That's 10 degrees below normal.

00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,535
So he died 10 hours ago.

00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:21,949
That would make it 2pm.

00:05:22,784 --> 00:05:25,654
Nick, Catherine, he's all yours.

00:05:25,787 --> 00:05:27,863
Thanks, David.

00:05:27,997 --> 00:05:29,990
OK. Let's see who you are.

00:05:42,762 --> 00:05:44,755
Nevada licence.

00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:47,178
James Jasper

00:05:47,308 --> 00:05:50,034
- When's hunting season?
- Deer season opened last week.

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,240
- Record number of permits.
- He should have worn his safety vest.

00:05:55,743 --> 00:05:59,784
Hunter lays in wait, Spots a deer

00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:02,289
- Hunter fires
(Gunshot)

00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:03,700
Bullet takes off

00:06:03,837 --> 00:06:06,126
Bullet keeps going until it stops.

00:06:06,256 --> 00:06:08,249
No bullet in the body.

00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:14,881
No bullet in the tree.

00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:16,723
It's got to be somewhere.

00:06:25,859 --> 00:06:27,852
Processed the crime scene.

00:06:27,986 --> 00:06:31,901
- Lots of treads and tracks. Nothing salient.
- What about the culverts?

00:06:32,032 --> 00:06:35,781
I came up empty.
I worked from the victims out till I hit the highway.

00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:38,746
Nothing. Nothing to process. No follow-up. Zip.

00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,334
You have something.

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,500
Print Lab ID'd one of the vics.

00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:46,957
Blonde or brunette?

00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:49,128
Brunette. Joan Marks.

00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:51,796
At 18, she was booked for felony shoplifting.

00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:53,587
Lived at home. We got the address.

00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,840
Warrick grabbed a Uniform.
He's on his way with a warrant.

00:07:19,163 --> 00:07:20,989
Catherine!

00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:25,284
- You find the bullet?
- Yeah.

00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,337
But how am I gonna get it out
without damaging it?

00:07:32,092 --> 00:07:34,085
You know what the textbook says.

00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:38,087
If you're not 100% sure how to collect it,
bring the whole thing in.

00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:47,558
Yeah. I'll figure it out.

00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,897
Thanks a lot.

00:07:55,032 --> 00:07:57,024
I'll take the driver's side.

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,872
1,200 miles, and it's an older model.

00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:12,999
Driver doesn't get out much.

00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:18,421
Registered to a Donna Marks.

00:08:18,555 --> 00:08:21,722
Could be our blonde. Related to Joan Marks.

00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,092
- I'll check with DMV.
- I already did.

00:08:25,854 --> 00:08:29,769
28 years old. Blonde. Blue eyes. 125Ib.

00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,774
5' 6". Sound familiar?

00:08:31,902 --> 00:08:33,100
That's her.

00:08:33,237 --> 00:08:37,021
Uniform was talking to a neighbour.
Donna is Joan's older sister.

00:08:37,157 --> 00:08:39,150
Well...

00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:43,116
we know what they have in common now,
don't we? Genetics.

00:08:43,247 --> 00:08:47,659
House belonged to the mother.
Donna's lived here alone since the mother died.

00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:51,458
Joan lived in Henderson.
The real action's around back.

00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:57,800
If the highway was the dump site...
this is the primary.

00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,758
Makes sense.

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,927
The blonde's lacerations were filled with glass

00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,053
She went through that door.

00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:09,180
From inside out.

00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:17,569
To take out one of these doors,
you need some serious momentum.

00:09:17,698 --> 00:09:21,945
No doubt. I'm gonna collect the glass,
then I'll start with the doorframe.

00:09:22,077 --> 00:09:24,070
How are you at solving puzzles?

00:09:24,204 --> 00:09:26,493
- You're the puzzle guy.
- I have a hint.

00:09:26,623 --> 00:09:30,455
When they cool sheet glass, they lay it out on tin.

00:09:30,586 --> 00:09:34,666
So the side that kissed up to the tin
will fluoresce under UV.

00:09:34,798 --> 00:09:36,838
It's still a long two days at the lab.

00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:40,253
I got some imprints on these blood spots here.

00:09:41,805 --> 00:09:45,506
Looks like the killer may nave stepped
in Donna's blood

00:09:45,642 --> 00:09:47,765
Or... maybe her sister stepped in it.

00:09:47,895 --> 00:09:50,220
There was blood on Joan Mark s' right shoe.

00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:54,975
That would place Joan at the house.

00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,103
And establish a timeline.

00:09:57,237 --> 00:09:59,230
If Joan did step in Donna's blood,

00:09:59,364 --> 00:10:03,658
then Donna was injured and bleeding
while Joan was still walking around.

00:10:32,314 --> 00:10:35,765
Sweet-and-sour pork.

00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,894
Smells fresh.

00:10:43,534 --> 00:10:45,526
More sweet-and-sour.

00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:47,737
Mostly sour.

00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:50,872
Single servings in the back. Spoiled.

00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:54,035
Family-sized boxes...

00:10:55,212 --> 00:10:56,208
...in front.

00:10:56,338 --> 00:10:58,331
One or two days old.

00:11:01,718 --> 00:11:05,134
What do you think? Increase in appetite or...

00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,256
perhaps a guest?

00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:36,202
Universal remote.

00:11:36,754 --> 00:11:40,621
She could do everything she wanted
from this chair but cook a roast.

00:11:40,758 --> 00:11:42,750
We already know she cooks like I do.

00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:44,711
Takeout on speed dial.

00:11:44,845 --> 00:11:46,802
Pottery Barn.

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,923
Lillian Vernon. Magnolia.

00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:50,137
Yafa Pen.

00:11:50,267 --> 00:11:53,470
She's a catalogue junkie.
We're on the same mailing lists.

00:11:53,604 --> 00:11:56,439
Catalogues... the internet.

00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:58,558
Mail order.

00:11:58,692 --> 00:12:01,017
Takeout. 1,200 miles on her car.

00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,480
Agoraphobic, maybe?

00:12:04,615 --> 00:12:06,323
Or...

00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,495
- she just doesn't like people?
- Ah, that's you talking.

00:12:12,289 --> 00:12:15,076
I'll haul in her PC. Check her e-mail.

00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:17,000
Look in on her social life.

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,792
Hey...

00:12:24,927 --> 00:12:27,085
the toilet seat's up.

00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:32,175
There was a man here.

00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:38,850
Nick.

00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:43,477
- Tell me what you got.
- Coroner said it's cut and dry.

00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:46,530
- Bullet severed an abdominal artery.
- Trajectory?

00:12:46,657 --> 00:12:51,366
Front to back. Round entered
an inch to the right of the umbilicus.

00:12:51,495 --> 00:12:55,030
Bullet's with Ballistics. Vega's got the widow.

00:12:55,165 --> 00:12:56,280
They're ready for us.

00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:59,583
Jimmy left early. Before I got up.

00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:01,788
When he didn't come home for dinner,

00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:04,627
I just figured that he got himself a deer.

00:13:04,758 --> 00:13:06,751
Did he go by himself?

00:13:06,885 --> 00:13:09,672
He took a day off of work
in the middle of the week?

00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:13,505
Well... um... we had both been laid off recently.

00:13:13,642 --> 00:13:16,180
He was in insurance.

00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:19,763
He... he was an auditor.

00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:21,725
How was your husband handling that?

00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:24,528
Oh, you know, he was OK.

00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:26,604
I mean... er...

00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,574
we had to borrow money
from his folks to pay the rent.

00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,692
That was hard on him.

00:13:31,827 --> 00:13:34,152
I have to call them. I haven't called them.

00:13:34,288 --> 00:13:35,830
- I...
- Mrs Jasper...

00:13:35,956 --> 00:13:38,743
was your husband an experienced hunter?

00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:40,868
Yes.

00:13:41,003 --> 00:13:42,995
Since he was a kid.

00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:46,214
He always looked forward to deer season.

00:13:47,718 --> 00:13:49,710
But... with the baby an' all...

00:13:49,845 --> 00:13:51,838
he missed the last few.

00:13:51,972 --> 00:13:53,965
It's me...

00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,424
isn't it?

00:13:57,561 --> 00:13:59,554
I encouraged him to go.

00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:04,065
I thought that it would help him
take his mind off things.

00:14:07,821 --> 00:14:09,814
What am I gonna do?

00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:20,707
Can you think of any reason
James wasn't wearing his safety vest?

00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:22,827
No.

00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:27,464
I mean, he was always... so careful.

00:14:27,591 --> 00:14:30,509
It doesn't sound right.

00:14:32,763 --> 00:14:35,633
If you're here about the blood
on Joan Mark s' shoe,

00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:37,177
I already told Sara.

00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,017
Backed up.

00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,814
I'm here about foreign DNA
on Donna Mark s' neck.

00:14:41,897 --> 00:14:44,470
Oh... well, on that, I got an ID.

00:14:45,609 --> 00:14:47,602
You found a match in CODIS?

00:14:47,736 --> 00:14:50,310
No, but I ran a DNA profile on both victims.

00:14:50,447 --> 00:14:52,938
What do all sisters have in common?

00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:55,067
DNA.

00:14:55,202 --> 00:14:58,867
You're saying that Donna's sister scratched her?

00:14:58,997 --> 00:15:00,242
No!

00:15:00,374 --> 00:15:01,572
Meow!

00:15:03,293 --> 00:15:06,627
So... did I solve the case?

00:15:06,755 --> 00:15:08,748
No, Greg. You didn't.

00:15:08,882 --> 00:15:10,839
But you've helped.

00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:19,600
Brass... I heard the database kicked out
a temporary restraining order.

00:15:19,727 --> 00:15:21,803
Joan Marks against her old boyfriend.

00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:25,306
I'll do you one better.
Gavin Pallard had one against her.

00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:27,848
- Tit for tat.
- They both filed last month.

00:15:27,985 --> 00:15:29,977
Hey...

00:15:30,112 --> 00:15:32,105
wanna find out why?

00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:34,315
Don't mind if I do.

00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,442
See this?

00:15:36,577 --> 00:15:38,237
I didn't get this French kissing.

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,363
Joanie had a temper

00:15:40,497 --> 00:15:45,740
Punctuated her sentences with throwing
furniture. Made it hot, you know?

00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,870
We'd break up to make up

00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:50,128
What about the last time?

00:15:50,257 --> 00:15:52,380
Look, since the whole TRO business...

00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,752
...she'd been in my house three times.

00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,295
- Couldn't stay away
- According to you.

00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:03,842
- When did you see her last?
- Yesterday. Dodged a coffeepot.

00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:06,185
- She hit the road.
- What was she driving?

00:16:06,315 --> 00:16:09,269
My Thunderbird.
I'd lent it to her and used my bike.

00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:10,646
But... you know...

00:16:10,778 --> 00:16:13,648
I'd like it back now.

00:16:13,781 --> 00:16:15,405
When we find it.

00:16:15,532 --> 00:16:19,447
Did she tell you she was going to her sister's?

00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,571
No.

00:16:21,705 --> 00:16:24,113
Why would she go there? It's oil and water.

00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:25,909
Joanie liked action.

00:16:26,043 --> 00:16:29,626
Real partier. The last party Donna went to
was her third birthday.

00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:33,171
What about you?
You been to Donna's house recently?

00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,293
No. Boring.

00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:39,045
She's always glued to her computer.

00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:42,846
Joan thought Donna owed her rent.
The house was in both their names.

00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:45,638
May I

00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,847
see the bottom of your shoes?

00:16:47,981 --> 00:16:49,144
Why?

00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,437
Why not?

00:16:59,368 --> 00:17:00,945
(Sighs)

00:17:04,415 --> 00:17:06,407
I like the shoes.

00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:08,700
I like 'em enough to get a warrant.

00:17:10,921 --> 00:17:13,377
I was just calling you.

00:17:13,507 --> 00:17:16,674
- You were?
- I carved your bullet out of that hunk of tree.

00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:20,752
You know, a bullet's only this big.
Y'all gave me a pound of redwood.

00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:23,131
- That's cottonwood.
- You should know.

00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,140
You wanted Nick to chop down the tree.

00:17:25,269 --> 00:17:27,760
- I did.
- Tell us about the bullet now.

00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:29,889
Striations. Lands. Grooves.

00:17:30,023 --> 00:17:33,772
I find some discoloration on the bullet's tail.
Check it out.

00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:36,903
An oxidation

00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,700
Yeah. Copper-jacketed. Tail was exposed.

00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,316
Oxidation takes a lot more than 24 hours.

00:17:42,453 --> 00:17:45,204
It's definitely older than y'all's crime scene.

00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:48,407
How's it going?

00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:51,876
We've got the wrong bullet,
but the case seems a write-off.

00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,162
Nothing says it wasn't a hunting accident.

00:17:54,298 --> 00:17:56,789
Insurance policy. A million goes to the widow.

00:17:56,925 --> 00:17:59,760
She was crying poverty
when she was in the money?

00:17:59,887 --> 00:18:02,342
There's more. It wasn't purchased by Mr Jasper.

00:18:02,473 --> 00:18:03,848
She bought it.

00:18:03,974 --> 00:18:06,809
Monthly instalments, taken on Mrs Jasper's card.

00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:12,096
He's in the insurance business
and she buys a policy behind his back.

00:18:12,232 --> 00:18:14,937
We've got to find that bullet.

00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:17,830
Donna Marks was a telecommuter

00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:20,372
Liked to shop Mail order Over the phone

00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:23,296
I retrieved lots of e-mail confirmations

00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:26,928
If she shopped online,
why did she place orders over the phone?

00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:28,931
Need for human contact?

00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:32,428
- Without physical contact?
- She spent time in chat rooms.

00:19:32,563 --> 00:19:34,555
Book clubs. Home crafts.

00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,682
Collected fountain pens.

00:19:36,817 --> 00:19:38,560
Personal e-mails?

00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,605
Only one buddy on her buddy list.

00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,575
- Screen name's Apollo.
- Pull up his most recent.

00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:48,192
That would be three days ago.

00:19:50,372 --> 00:19:52,448
(Reads) I know it sounds weird, but...

00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,121
my life began when I first heard your voice.

00:19:55,252 --> 00:19:58,502
When you said my name, it felt so right.

00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,623
Did you feel it too?

00:20:02,926 --> 00:20:08,169
It's easy to wear your heart on your sleeve
when you're not looking in his eyes.

00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:12,767
He said her name. So their relationship
must have extended beyond the computer.

00:20:14,938 --> 00:20:17,014
So, what do we know about this Apollo?

00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,142
You know that garbage?

00:20:19,276 --> 00:20:22,859
- Those numbers at the bottom of every e-mail?
- Yean

00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:27,899
It's actually a unique number that registers
the location of the sender's terminal.

00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:32,412
- An address?
- Internet protocol address CSI has access

00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:36,703
Seven different IP addresses
means he used seven different computers.

00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:38,828
That's strange.

00:20:38,962 --> 00:20:40,955
Could be a network.

00:20:43,717 --> 00:20:46,884
23000 Ganza Avenue, Ely, Nevada.

00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,681
Western Nevada Correctional Facility

00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:53,301
Her Greek god is in the slam.

00:20:56,897 --> 00:20:59,649
Like it or not, prison is a business.

00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:03,144
The facility is privately owned.
Contract with the state.

00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:05,686
Our aim is simple. Customer satisfaction.

00:21:05,823 --> 00:21:08,658
The key to a successful business.
Word of mouth.

00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:11,322
Criminals are cutting deals to get sent here.

00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:14,371
I imagine. It's like a theme park.

00:21:14,498 --> 00:21:17,748
The more guys through the turnstile,
the more money we make.

00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,830
So, as long as I'm in business,
you're in business?

00:21:20,963 --> 00:21:22,421
Ker-ching.

00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:25,003
(Chatter)

00:21:25,134 --> 00:21:28,668
Are your inmates allowed to use e-mail
anywhere else but here?

00:21:28,804 --> 00:21:30,713
Personal computers are prohibited.

00:21:30,848 --> 00:21:34,430
But they're allowed to surf the web,
send and receive e-mail?

00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,604
Only at these terminals.
All internet activity is strictly monitored.

00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:43,558
The blouse comes in Laguna blue, Amazon
green or Tahitian red, our most popular colour.

00:21:43,694 --> 00:21:45,686
How would you like that shipped?

00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:49,356
UPS? Overnight?

00:21:51,952 --> 00:21:55,819
Something tells me state funds
aren't your only source of revenue.

00:21:55,956 --> 00:21:59,455
We have contracts with several retailers.
Perfectly legal.

00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:01,873
So, let me get this straight.

00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:04,162
I receive a catalogue in the mail.

00:22:04,298 --> 00:22:06,836
I call a toll-free number to place an order,

00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:10,301
and I'm giving my personal credit card
information to a...

00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,421
hello-I'm-doing-time/life operator?

00:22:12,556 --> 00:22:16,470
Once orders are sent to the fulfilment centre,
only the retailer has access.

00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:21,976
All right. Let's cut to the chase.
I'm investigating the deaths of two women,

00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,777
one of whom was having a relationship
with an inmate.

00:22:24,902 --> 00:22:26,479
I need to speak to him.

00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:28,485
His e-mail alias is Apollo.

00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:32,065
- I'll check the log.
- That comes to $ 17493

00:22:33,202 --> 00:22:35,241
Thank you for calling

00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:38,040
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

00:22:38,165 --> 00:22:40,952
- I can get a warrant.
- It won't do you much good.

00:22:41,085 --> 00:22:45,414
Mickey Rutledge, aka Apollo,
was released three days ago.

00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,808
Hey.

00:23:05,943 --> 00:23:08,019
Hey.

00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:11,605
- How's the glass puzzle going?
- Still putting it together.

00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,868
I'm just doing a trace on Donna Mark s' clothing
and I came across this fibre.

00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,402
Look at this cross section.

00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:20,911
Triangular

00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:23,413
That means it can't be clothing fibre.

00:23:23,544 --> 00:23:25,536
Yeah. Short and coarse.

00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:27,580
Car upholstery?

00:23:27,714 --> 00:23:31,380
Yeah, but that still doesn't get us anything.

00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:35,590
We found the vics near the freeway.
We've been thinking vehicle transport.

00:23:35,722 --> 00:23:37,715
Well, it's from black upholstery.

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,554
What colour was
the boyfriend's Thunderbird?

00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:42,678
I'll ask him. And his lawyer.

00:23:42,813 --> 00:23:47,771
The blood from his shoe was consistent
with Donna Mark s' DNA. He was at the house.

00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:49,894
Really?

00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:52,401
What about the blood from Joan Mark s' shoe?

00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:54,524
Also a match.

00:23:54,658 --> 00:23:57,196
Joan and Gavin both stepped in Donna's blood.

00:23:59,163 --> 00:24:01,701
- Fine. I went there.
- We already know that.

00:24:01,832 --> 00:24:03,908
We're looking for, "Fine,

00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:05,620
I went there

00:24:05,753 --> 00:24:07,413
and..."

00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:12,789
My client went there after the fact.
He was looking for his girlfriend. Didn't find her.

00:24:12,926 --> 00:24:14,919
Right.

00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:17,889
- He found a crime scene.
- Broken glass.

00:24:18,015 --> 00:24:20,054
A pool of blood.

00:24:20,184 --> 00:24:22,472
- But you didn't call 911.
- I was scared.

00:24:22,603 --> 00:24:24,595
I took off.

00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,399
Besides, there was
a restraining order against me.

00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,560
Gavin, what colour's your car?

00:24:30,694 --> 00:24:33,648
- Your missing Thunderbird.
- Blue. Why?

00:24:33,781 --> 00:24:34,729
Interior?

00:24:34,865 --> 00:24:37,273
Black. Did you find it?

00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,568
- Not yet.
- But we will.

00:24:39,703 --> 00:24:42,538
OK. The tree is a point of reference.

00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:45,202
Yeah, and since the bullet didn't hit the tree

00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,326
and the blood's to the west,

00:24:47,461 --> 00:24:51,589
then the through-and-through
defines our search area.

00:24:51,715 --> 00:24:54,040
The furthest drop of blood is here.

00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:58,630
The spatter seems to be confined
to a 45-degree angle.

00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:02,927
So the bullet should be
somewhere between your rope and mine.

00:25:04,061 --> 00:25:08,770
Yeah. We've reduced a 360-degree crime scene
to a 45-degree angle.

00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,893
Congratulations to us.

00:25:12,027 --> 00:25:14,020
It's still a needle in a haystack.

00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,643
Nick...

00:25:53,777 --> 00:25:55,853
Yeah?

00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:59,024
Let's pack it up.
The bullet couldn't have gone this far.

00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:08,327
Hey. Saw your Tahoe.
I didn't expect to see you guys back here.

00:26:08,459 --> 00:26:11,662
Just... uh... tying up a few loose ends.

00:26:11,795 --> 00:26:12,910
Maybe this'll help.

00:26:13,046 --> 00:26:16,332
James Jasper didn't purchase a hunting licence.

00:26:16,467 --> 00:26:19,503
Well, he was out of work.
Maybe he was trying to save money.

00:26:19,636 --> 00:26:24,215
A licence is 24 buck s. Hunting without one
is a $1,000 fine and six months in jail.

00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,429
Ooh!

00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:29,426
Oh, well, that's not worth the risk.
Maybe he wasn't up here to hunt.

00:26:29,563 --> 00:26:31,188
We haven't heard a single shot.

00:26:31,315 --> 00:26:33,224
Where are these hunters?

00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:35,185
You only hunt deer at dusk and dawn.

00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:37,857
Right. Right. Feeding time.

00:26:37,988 --> 00:26:40,693
It's when they're out in the open.
And other game?

00:26:40,824 --> 00:26:43,113
This time of year, only deer's in season.

00:26:43,243 --> 00:26:45,402
Take off those vests if you want.

00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,530
No-one hunts during the day,

00:26:47,664 --> 00:26:51,413
but the coroner placed
Jasper's time of death at 2pm.

00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:54,580
Yeah. It's an odd time for a hunting accident.

00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:05,387
Hey. Brass is holding the boyfriend
on a TRO violation.

00:27:05,516 --> 00:27:08,719
I'm going to the lab to process the prints
from the toilet seat.

00:27:08,852 --> 00:27:11,889
Guy claims he was in and out.
No time to make a pit stop.

00:27:12,022 --> 00:27:14,976
- I processed the prints.
- You did?

00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:17,778
- They're not a match to Joan's boyfriend.
- What?!

00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:19,730
But we do have a match.

00:27:19,863 --> 00:27:22,152
Donna's cyber boyfriend.

00:27:22,282 --> 00:27:26,743
- I thought he was in jail?
- Just released. His parole officer brought him in.

00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:30,535
You're fishing. I just got out of the joint.
I was never at Donna's.

00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:34,414
We found your fingerprints
on the toilet seat in her bathroom.

00:27:34,545 --> 00:27:38,412
What are you gonna do?
Arrest me for flushing the toilet?

00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:42,509
Well, unfortunately, I can't arrest you for lying.

00:27:42,636 --> 00:27:44,178
Help me out here.

00:27:44,304 --> 00:27:48,682
Mickey, you have the right to an attorney,
but if you're not hiding anything,

00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:50,683
I suggest you answer their questions.

00:27:50,811 --> 00:27:52,804
(Sighs)

00:27:54,356 --> 00:27:56,349
Look, we met over the internet.

00:27:57,818 --> 00:27:59,811
We had a lot in common.

00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:01,938
Donna understood my situation.

00:28:02,072 --> 00:28:04,065
When I told her I was getting out...

00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:05,859
she invited me over.

00:28:08,245 --> 00:28:09,953
No-one's ever brought me flowers.

00:28:11,331 --> 00:28:15,792
She served takeout. What do I care?
It wasn't chipped beef.

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,382
- How is it?
- Sweet-and-sour pork. My favourite.

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,045
She invites you for lunch. Everything's great.

00:28:27,181 --> 00:28:30,632
And somewhere between the fortune cookies
and sunset

00:28:30,768 --> 00:28:33,638
Donna and her sister are both murdered.

00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:37,523
Thoughts?

00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:40,057
Huh. I think the sister's a piece of work.

00:28:40,194 --> 00:28:44,026
As soon as we finish eating, she shows up...

00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:45,780
with an attitude.

00:28:45,908 --> 00:28:48,825
- This is my house too!
- I'm paying the taxes.

00:28:49,953 --> 00:28:51,448
Who the hell's this?

00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:56,408
First thing I learned in the joint -
when inmates fight, you make yourself invisible.

00:28:56,543 --> 00:28:57,824
I got out.

00:28:57,961 --> 00:29:02,291
Six months ago,
Donna Marks ordered a sweater

00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:04,832
and two scarves from Magnolia Apparel.

00:29:04,968 --> 00:29:07,008
You took the order.

00:29:07,137 --> 00:29:08,679
I took 50 calls a day.

00:29:08,806 --> 00:29:13,053
How many of your callers invited you home
and served you Chinese food?

00:29:16,105 --> 00:29:19,723
When Donna placed her order for the clothes...

00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,349
she gave you her e-mail address, didn't she?

00:29:22,486 --> 00:29:25,522
Yeah. She was lonely.

00:29:25,656 --> 00:29:27,732
She struck up a conversation with me

00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,526
Reached out.

00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,198
Hey...

00:29:32,329 --> 00:29:35,081
you know, I don't usually meet girls like Donna.

00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:38,367
She was nice.

00:29:38,502 --> 00:29:40,495
She was vulnerable.

00:29:40,629 --> 00:29:42,918
No social life. No friends. Not even a cat.

00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:44,756
All she had was her work

00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:48,466
She ordered from catalogues
so she had something to look forward to.

00:29:48,595 --> 00:29:50,303
You know, Mickey...

00:29:50,431 --> 00:29:53,100
I don't think your intention was to kill.

00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:56,890
All of your priors are for non-violent activities,
right?

00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,354
Look, I've been in the system. I know the law.

00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:03,152
I admit, I was there.

00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:05,228
So what?

00:30:10,367 --> 00:30:12,360
You know where to find me.

00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,910
I'll keep my eye on him.

00:30:25,466 --> 00:30:29,000
Joan's boyfriend, Gavin Pallard,
blood on his shoe and a TRO.

00:30:29,136 --> 00:30:33,003
Donna's boyfriend, Mickey Rutledge,
opportunity and a rap sheet.

00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,390
Both hid the truth
until confronted with the evidence.

00:30:37,978 --> 00:30:39,971
Well...

00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:42,098
we know we have two liars.

00:30:44,318 --> 00:30:46,773
Do we have a killer?

00:30:52,242 --> 00:30:54,235
Hey.

00:30:54,369 --> 00:30:56,362
Point of impact.

00:30:58,207 --> 00:31:00,199
It's... uh...

00:31:01,835 --> 00:31:04,077
...65 inches...

00:31:04,213 --> 00:31:06,205
from the base.

00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:11,251
- So, what does that tell us?
- Well, Donna was 5' 6".

00:31:11,386 --> 00:31:15,680
If she was thrown through that glass,
the point of impact would have been lower.

00:31:19,228 --> 00:31:21,220
She had multiple incised wounds.

00:31:22,356 --> 00:31:26,567
The only contusion was on her forehead,
suggesting that's where contact was made.

00:31:26,693 --> 00:31:29,647
So she was upright
when she went through the door.

00:31:32,616 --> 00:31:34,609
She walked through it.

00:31:34,743 --> 00:31:36,902
You saying it was an accident?

00:31:37,037 --> 00:31:39,244
- It's your science.
- Nice work.

00:31:39,373 --> 00:31:40,322
Thanks.

00:31:40,457 --> 00:31:45,166
PD found Pallard's Thunderbird
hidden off the 169, five miles from the dump site.

00:31:45,295 --> 00:31:47,502
Hook up with Auto Detail. Tow it in.

00:31:57,266 --> 00:31:59,175
Radiator's cracked.

00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:04,517
That might explain why Joan bought coolant
twice in the last week from a convenience store.

00:32:04,648 --> 00:32:06,937
- We ran her credit cards.
- Well...

00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:10,234
whoever drove this last
filled up the radiator fluid,

00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:12,438
but instead of coolant, they used water.

00:32:12,573 --> 00:32:15,657
Either someone unfamiliar
with the car or...

00:32:16,785 --> 00:32:19,110
...someone in a desperate situation, maybe.

00:32:19,246 --> 00:32:21,654
Radiator cap. I'll print it.

00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:24,198
Good.

00:32:24,334 --> 00:32:26,457
Grab me a sample of fluid too, will you?

00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:31,874
Gunshot residue.

00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:35,294
Expect the unexpected.

00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:38,880
GSR on the clothing means
the victim was shot at close range.

00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:43,016
So now what? We're thinking murder?

00:32:43,145 --> 00:32:45,470
Or suicide.

00:32:45,606 --> 00:32:48,856
He never fired his rifle.
What did he shoot himself with?

00:32:48,984 --> 00:32:50,977
OK.

00:32:51,111 --> 00:32:54,480
But if he was murdered,
we should have found some evidence

00:32:54,615 --> 00:32:56,572
of the killer at the crime scene.

00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,737
Whoever shot him
would have been eyeball to eyeball.

00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:02,539
Who could have gotten that close
without a struggle?

00:33:02,664 --> 00:33:04,456
Exactly.

00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:06,576
It's somebody he knew.

00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:10,375
I'm gonna call on Vega.
See if he's checked out Mrs Jasper's alibi.

00:33:10,506 --> 00:33:12,498
- OK.
- I'll meet you at the car.

00:33:12,633 --> 00:33:14,625
- Hey, Nick.
- Hey, Sara.

00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,752
How's your case going?

00:33:16,887 --> 00:33:19,378
You ever try to print a radiator cap?

00:33:19,515 --> 00:33:21,424
Smudge city.

00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:23,634
Yeah. Yeah, I know. It's impossible.

00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:26,176
But it's just a radiator cap, so...

00:33:26,313 --> 00:33:28,436
- give yourself a break.
- Thank you.

00:33:28,565 --> 00:33:30,523
Sara...

00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:33,770
...you gotta get out more.

00:33:41,078 --> 00:33:43,533
So you got this water from a radiator?

00:33:43,664 --> 00:33:45,656
Yes.

00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:47,784
It ain't no Rocky Mountain spring.

00:33:47,918 --> 00:33:50,623
- What is it, Greg?
- A nasty sodium count.

00:33:50,754 --> 00:33:52,913
Potassium. Phosphorus.

00:33:58,095 --> 00:34:00,633
You've got that look. What did I say right?

00:34:04,768 --> 00:34:06,761
OK. Thanks for the info.

00:34:06,895 --> 00:34:08,888
We'll keep you posted.

00:34:09,022 --> 00:34:11,395
Well, Mrs Jasper's alibi checks out.

00:34:11,525 --> 00:34:13,767
She was at work from 10am to 6pm.

00:34:13,902 --> 00:34:15,895
Ate lunch at her desk.

00:34:16,029 --> 00:34:18,022
She didn't kill her husband.

00:34:18,157 --> 00:34:19,983
Murder for hire?

00:34:20,117 --> 00:34:23,153
A pro would have shot him in the heart.

00:34:23,287 --> 00:34:25,279
This guy was shot in the gut.

00:34:25,414 --> 00:34:27,952
Bullet didn't come close to his spinal cord.

00:34:30,711 --> 00:34:34,246
Wait a minute.
Abdominal injuries take time to bleed out.

00:34:34,381 --> 00:34:37,715
It would take 10 minutes
for haemorrhagic shock to set in.

00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:39,302
He would have been mobile.

00:34:39,428 --> 00:34:41,919
Right. But he never moved.

00:34:42,055 --> 00:34:46,100
He was in front of this tree
when he was shot. He didn't try to reach his car

00:34:46,226 --> 00:34:48,219
or get help, he just...

00:34:49,396 --> 00:34:51,389
...sat down and waited to die.

00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:53,516
Yeah.

00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,643
Yeah, I see where you're going here.

00:34:55,778 --> 00:34:59,360
His injuries and his behaviour
aren't consistent with murder,

00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,159
but they're not consistent with suicide either.

00:35:03,827 --> 00:35:08,573
99 out of 100 suicides by a gun -
muzzle to the mouth, bullet to the brain.

00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:10,700
There's always just that one.

00:35:10,834 --> 00:35:12,626
Look...

00:35:12,753 --> 00:35:15,291
suicidals want it quick and painless.

00:35:15,422 --> 00:35:18,174
Bleeding to death is slow and painful.

00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,589
Not to mention he never fired his rifle.

00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,053
No, the weapon we found was never fired.

00:35:24,181 --> 00:35:26,754
That's a big stretch.

00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:28,885
He brought his rifle plus a spare?

00:35:29,019 --> 00:35:31,095
He shoots himself in the gut.

00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:36,063
Leaving himself time to hide the weapon.

00:35:36,193 --> 00:35:39,894
There's no blood trail. And what did he do
with the spare? Throw it up a tree?

00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:44,901
How about the lake?

00:35:46,036 --> 00:35:47,910
Yeah.

00:35:48,038 --> 00:35:50,031
Yeah, OK. Heads up.

00:35:59,466 --> 00:36:01,459
I've just marked our search area.

00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:08,174
You know...

00:36:08,308 --> 00:36:10,301
even if your theory's right,

00:36:10,436 --> 00:36:15,014
we still haven't explained the insurance policy
purchased by the wife.

00:36:15,149 --> 00:36:17,141
(Tapping)

00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:19,605
Hey!

00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:22,772
Metal on metal.

00:36:25,534 --> 00:36:28,072
- Hold on, let me give you a hand.
- OK.

00:36:28,203 --> 00:36:30,196
It's right there

00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:32,572
Yean I got it I got it

00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:37,912
Whoa...

00:36:38,046 --> 00:36:40,039
Water pistol.

00:36:40,174 --> 00:36:43,128
Well, we never found the bullet,
but we found the gun.

00:36:57,066 --> 00:36:59,473
Mr Jasper committed suicide.

00:37:01,945 --> 00:37:04,234
And the wife's out a million bucks.

00:37:04,364 --> 00:37:06,357
Thank you.

00:37:08,535 --> 00:37:10,528
Mrs Jasper...

00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:16,249
you purchased a life insurance policy
on your husband,

00:37:16,376 --> 00:37:18,784
in which you are the sole beneficiary.

00:37:18,921 --> 00:37:21,791
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:37:22,925 --> 00:37:27,172
We have the actual application for the policy...

00:37:27,304 --> 00:37:29,297
with your signature.

00:37:29,431 --> 00:37:34,140
Ma'am, you are aware that insurance policies
exclude suicide?

00:37:34,269 --> 00:37:36,511
Your husband...

00:37:36,647 --> 00:37:38,639
staged his death...

00:37:38,774 --> 00:37:41,347
to...look like a homicide.

00:37:41,485 --> 00:37:44,652
As a beneficiary...

00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,615
if you knew of his intentions to...

00:37:48,742 --> 00:37:50,865
...take his own life...

00:37:50,994 --> 00:37:52,987
that would constitute fraud.

00:37:53,122 --> 00:37:56,372
If I knew, I would have stopped him.

00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,999
Jimmy was everything to me.

00:38:00,129 --> 00:38:04,956
I didn't... I didn't buy the policy.
I didn't know about his plans.

00:38:05,092 --> 00:38:06,551
Hi.

00:38:06,677 --> 00:38:08,669
Hi.

00:38:11,473 --> 00:38:13,466
Do you wanna explain this?

00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,973
Sure.

00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:21,894
Mrs Jasper, when you claimed
your husband's personal possessions,

00:38:22,025 --> 00:38:24,018
you signed a release form, yeah?

00:38:25,446 --> 00:38:28,696
I ran that form
through our questionable documents lab,

00:38:28,824 --> 00:38:33,700
and I crosschecked your signature
with the signature on the insurance application.

00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:37,865
It's not yours.

00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,416
Your husband must have forged it.

00:38:41,545 --> 00:38:43,953
I also checked with the insurance company.

00:38:45,549 --> 00:38:47,542
Your husband opened the account.

00:38:49,803 --> 00:38:51,796
Why? Why?

00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:55,015
I don't understand that. Why did he do that?

00:38:55,142 --> 00:39:00,481
Because he knew that if he had bought
the insurance, it would have sent up a red flag.

00:39:00,564 --> 00:39:02,722
So, what you're saying is...

00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,065
...that my husband...

00:39:08,197 --> 00:39:10,770
killed himself for me?

00:39:12,618 --> 00:39:14,610
Yes, ma'am.

00:39:21,251 --> 00:39:23,374
It may sound funny, but I'm proud of it.

00:39:23,504 --> 00:39:26,255
It took a year to put in
my new fertigation system.

00:39:26,381 --> 00:39:29,299
It mixes the fertiliser
with the irrigation system.

00:39:29,426 --> 00:39:31,668
How about that? Economical and practical.

00:39:31,804 --> 00:39:33,880
What you're looking for is over here.

00:39:39,019 --> 00:39:41,557
Cars are always overheating on this stretch.

00:39:41,688 --> 00:39:43,432
And everyone thinks water is free.

00:39:43,565 --> 00:39:47,433
What do you use in your fertiliser?
Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium?

00:39:47,569 --> 00:39:49,811
Standard 6-10-10 mixture.

00:39:49,947 --> 00:39:51,939
Mr Willoughby...

00:39:52,074 --> 00:39:55,110
would you mind if I fingerprint your spigot?

00:39:55,244 --> 00:39:57,450
No-one's ever asked me that before.

00:40:18,475 --> 00:40:20,468
Thirsty?

00:40:20,602 --> 00:40:22,013
I'm good, thanks.

00:40:22,146 --> 00:40:23,688
I wouldn't drink it either.

00:40:23,814 --> 00:40:26,352
I wouldn't even put it in my radiator.

00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:31,146
I don't have all the pieces yet, Mickey, but...

00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,272
I'll tell you what we do have.

00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:36,319
- You're an ex-con. Get the hell out!
- Don't listen.

00:40:36,452 --> 00:40:38,409
This is my house. This is my life.

00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:41,206
You're so desperate
you date through the computer.

00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:43,532
Then you end up with him. Pathetic!

00:40:44,668 --> 00:40:47,076
We know that Joan scratched Donna.

00:40:47,212 --> 00:40:49,501
We also know that Donna died first.

00:40:49,631 --> 00:40:51,339
I didn't kill her.

00:40:51,467 --> 00:40:54,467
That's right. You didn't.

00:40:54,595 --> 00:40:56,883
- You are so selfish!
- Get your hands off me!

00:40:57,556 --> 00:40:59,050
Donna's death was an accident.

00:40:59,391 --> 00:41:01,716
Oh! Aaargh!

00:41:02,061 --> 00:41:04,765
But Joan went off on you.

00:41:04,897 --> 00:41:07,898
And up to that point
you hadn't done anything wrong

00:41:08,025 --> 00:41:12,354
- So what went wrong?
- It wasn't my fault.

00:41:12,696 --> 00:41:16,279
- She's dead.
- You are going back where you came from.

00:41:22,122 --> 00:41:24,198
Rehabilitation was working for me.

00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:26,325
Put a guy in that position...

00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,453
He's got to go all the way.

00:41:28,962 --> 00:41:30,955
Aaargh!

00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,082
(Neck snaps)

00:41:37,096 --> 00:41:40,050
You figured if you hid the bodies,
you'd be in the clear.

00:41:40,182 --> 00:41:42,056
But you didn't nave a car

00:41:42,184 --> 00:41:44,260
Joan did.

00:41:57,825 --> 00:42:01,609
You could have just backed off.
Let Joan make the call.

00:42:03,705 --> 00:42:06,623
I would have landed myself
right back in the joint.

00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:09,039
- You don't know that.
- Come on.

00:42:09,169 --> 00:42:11,839
Who's gonna believe a guy like me?

00:42:11,922 --> 00:42:14,460
A guy like me.

00:43:22,201 --> 00:43:24,194
Hey, it's Sara.

00:43:25,329 --> 00:43:27,903
I was thinking...

00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,033
You wanna go out... somewhere?
