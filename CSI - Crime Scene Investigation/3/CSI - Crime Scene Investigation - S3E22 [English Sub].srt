up the bleachers,

in a room

00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:57,057
with only
one way out?

00:07:57,123 --> 00:08:01,161
Cause of death was asphyxiation
due to strangulation.

00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:03,296
Multiple round oval bruises

00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:05,932

00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:19,412
None that I could find,
but take a look at this.

00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:21,381
The, uh, bruises
are concentrated

00:08:21,448 --> 00:08:22,515
on the left side
of the neck.

00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:24,350
On the right side,
there's only one.

00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,252
Killer strangled her

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,420
with his right hand.

00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:28,855
One hand only.

00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:31,691
Yeah, prolonged pressure
on the jugular.

00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:37,864
He must have been looking
right in her eyes.

00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:39,099
Yeah, that takes hate.

00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:41,601
I'll get a measurement
of the, uh, grip size.

00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:44,003
What about the SART kit?

00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,105
It's on Graves' desk,

00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:46,940
but he's pretty backed up,
more than usual.

00:08:48,742 --> 00:08:49,776
Bruises on her hands,

00:08:49,843 --> 00:08:51,511
her arms,

00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:53,847
upper torso--
it's consistent with rape.

00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:55,448
Maybe not.

00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:57,117
I did a vaginal clock on her.

00:08:57,183 --> 00:08:59,052
Signs of activity
at 11:00, 12:00,

00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:02,122
and 1:00, and that would imply
rough sex, not rape.

00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:05,892
May have started as sex,
but it ended as murder.

00:09:35,388 --> 00:09:36,489
Well, I keep one by the bed.

00:09:36,556 --> 00:09:37,824

00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:39,793

00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:54,507
You should be telling
Nick or Sara.

00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:55,842
Yeah, couldn't find them.

00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:57,477
They must be on another break.

00:09:57,544 --> 00:09:59,979
Anyway, the blister pack
is methadone.

00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:02,582
40 milligrams,
former smack addict dose.

00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:04,718
And that ceramic chip?
Not ceramic.

00:10:04,784 --> 00:10:06,820
It's acrylic
with a quartz resin composite

00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:08,755
used primarily
in dental crowns.

00:10:08,822 --> 00:10:09,823
Cheap ones.

00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:10,957
Good work.

00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:12,992
Yeah, thank you. Listen,
I'd like to think that and I...

00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:14,594
Now go tell
Nick or Sara.

00:10:16,463 --> 00:10:17,731
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:10:17,797 --> 00:10:20,266
Problem is AGIS doesn't play
real nice with partials.

00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,102
So here's what I'm going to do.

00:10:22,168 --> 00:10:24,070
I'll pick eight or nine
distinctive features,

00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:25,371
run those through the system,

00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:29,209
and examine anything
with a 60% or better match.

00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:31,511
You could end up
with over 100 hits.

00:10:31,578 --> 00:10:33,213
You trying
to discourage me?

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,647
It's all about
interpretation.

00:10:34,714 --> 00:10:36,015
Knowing what's
commonplace,

00:10:36,082 --> 00:10:38,351
and what's unique.

00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:04,310
That's where
skill comes in.

00:11:04,377 --> 00:11:06,513
You still have to check
each one by hand.

00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:08,181
You're going

The semen inside your victim--

00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,888
I got a DNA match through CODIS.

00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:16,089
It's Jason Kent.

00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:17,657

00:11:43,183 --> 00:11:45,652
She was a friend.

"No, I'm innocent"

You did the whole bit.

00:11:58,898 --> 00:12:00,333
The whole 15 years.

00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,135
You're a hard-core ex-con.

00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:03,770
This must really piss you off.

00:12:03,837 --> 00:12:04,804
You know what?

00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:06,306
I know the conditions
of my release.

00:12:06,372 --> 00:12:08,408
So you can check
whatever you'd like.

00:12:08,475 --> 00:12:10,777
You want to tell me
what this is about?

00:12:10,844 --> 00:12:13,313
You're under arrest for
the murder of Alison Carpenter.

00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:16,750
Last night, your old high
school, Go Monarchs.

00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:18,952
I'm not talking to you
without a lawyer.

00:12:19,018 --> 00:12:20,954
Looks like you bit your lip.

00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:25,959
May I see your hands, please?

00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:31,931
Recently clipped your nails,
huh?

00:12:31,998 --> 00:12:34,067
BRASS:
And you're such
a smart guy,

00:12:34,134 --> 00:12:36,369
bet you flushed them
down the toilet.

00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:12,872
All right.

00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,281
How'd you do
with the nail clippers?

00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:23,183
Right over here.

00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:25,685
Figured it wasn't
high priority

00:13:25,752 --> 00:13:27,520
since I'd already ID'd
the semen in the victim.

00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:29,656
GRISSOM:
That only proves
that they had sex.

00:13:29,723 --> 00:13:31,958
The nail clippers can place
Jason Kent at the murder scene.

00:13:32,025 --> 00:13:33,626
His nails,

00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:36,296
her DNA,
traces of the booth, et cetera.

00:13:36,362 --> 00:13:38,531
Killer, victim, location.

00:13:38,598 --> 00:13:40,333
Holy Trinity, Greg.
I need that.

00:13:48,308 --> 00:13:49,876
So?

00:13:49,943 --> 00:13:52,912
ARCHIE:
Just getting started.
I'll keep you posted.

00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,486
SECRETARY:
Mr. Grissom, I have
your phone messages.

00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:00,987
Thank you.

00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:07,360
Grissom, do you
have a second?

00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,552
MAN: His vitals are stable 
...full thickness burns
on the neck and back.

00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,943
Burn unit.
Let's move.

00:15:24,229 --> 00:15:26,565
Are you okay?

00:15:27,866 --> 00:15:28,867
Uh-huh.

00:15:34,172 --> 00:15:35,173
Honey, this doesn't
look good.

00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,075
It's fine.

00:15:37,142 --> 00:15:39,110
Cleanup's
going to be something.

00:15:39,177 --> 00:15:41,179
We should get started.

00:15:41,246 --> 00:15:43,915
You need to get stitches.

00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,018
I'm okay.

00:15:47,085 --> 00:15:48,453
Would you take care
of her hand, please?

00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:52,390
MAN:
Yes, sir,
I just got here.

00:15:52,457 --> 00:15:55,227
Several injuries,
one serious.

00:15:55,293 --> 00:15:57,195
Fire department
arson explosives

00:15:57,262 --> 00:15:59,631
are assessing
the damage right now.

00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:02,501
What'd you do to my lab,
Grissom?

00:16:14,546 --> 00:16:17,315
I'm going to need a complete
evidence inventory by case.

00:16:17,382 --> 00:16:19,084
What's been lost,
what's contaminated,

00:16:19,151 --> 00:16:20,318
what's salvageable.

00:16:20,385 --> 00:16:21,553
We have LIMS backup

00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,421
for every computer
on the network.

00:16:23,488 --> 00:16:26,124
I'm sure we've only lost
an hour or two of data.

00:16:26,191 --> 00:16:27,926
Well, we'll never
sell that in court.

00:16:27,993 --> 00:16:30,162
Defense attorneys
will rip us apart.

00:16:30,228 --> 00:16:32,297
That, uh,

00:16:32,364 --> 00:16:34,799
double murder movie
star case last year,

00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:37,969
compromised evidence,
lax procedures, mistakes.

00:16:38,036 --> 00:16:39,838
We got a conviction on that.

00:16:39,905 --> 00:16:41,072
You got lucky.

00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:42,774
This is a priority.

00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:43,809
I want to know

00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,010
how this happened.

00:16:45,076 --> 00:16:46,611
And who's to blame?

00:16:48,713 --> 00:16:50,448
I'm going to have Catherine
run the investigation.

00:16:50,515 --> 00:16:51,449
I'm on a murder case.

00:16:51,516 --> 00:16:54,219
I'll be waiting for her report.

00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:00,859
So what was your relationship
again with Alison Carpenter?

00:17:00,926 --> 00:17:04,563
Once again, my client asserts
his Fifth Amendment rights

00:17:04,629 --> 00:17:06,398
and declines to answer.

00:17:06,464 --> 00:17:08,233
Why bother?

00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,303
His semen was found
inside the victim.

00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:14,873
A finding from a crime unit
that blows up its own DNA lab?

00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,042
You really think that's going
to carry a lot of weight?

00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:19,644
BRASS ( <i>over speakers</i> ):
I understand you're
in a methadone program.

00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:20,645
WOMAN:
So what?

00:17:20,712 --> 00:17:22,247
My client's a recovering addict.

00:17:22,314 --> 00:17:23,482
He got hooked in prison.

00:17:23,548 --> 00:17:25,484
The war on drugs
works about as well

00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,352
on the inside
as it does on the street.

00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:29,654
Well, methadone puts him
in the victim's car.

00:17:29,721 --> 00:17:31,690
There are thousands
of methadone users

00:17:31,756 --> 00:17:33,058
out there.

00:17:33,124 --> 00:17:34,860
With chipped dental crowns?

00:17:36,628 --> 00:17:38,396
We're going to need
an orthodontic sample.

00:17:38,463 --> 00:17:39,731
This is harassment.

00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:41,399
We're done cooperating here.

00:17:50,075 --> 00:17:52,711
My third week in prison.

00:17:52,777 --> 00:17:54,546
Break the new guy's teeth,

00:17:54,613 --> 00:17:57,349
he can't bite down on something
that's shoved in his mouth.

00:18:10,362 --> 00:18:11,696
JOHNSON:
That box of tapes

00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:13,198
we found
in her motel room,

00:18:13,265 --> 00:18:14,466
this is the third one.

00:18:14,533 --> 00:18:17,435
She recorded about
nine hours in total.

00:18:17,502 --> 00:18:19,437
Started like this.

00:18:19,504 --> 00:18:21,940
CARPENTER:
It's almost 6:00.

00:18:22,007 --> 00:18:24,109
I'm almost ready.

00:18:24,176 --> 00:18:26,244
I know there's nothing
to be nervous about,

00:18:26,311 --> 00:18:28,380
but I am.

00:18:28,446 --> 00:18:30,682
He's suffered so much.

00:18:30,749 --> 00:18:35,954
I'm going to help him remember
who he really is.

00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:38,056
So, she knew Jason Kent.

00:18:38,123 --> 00:18:39,291
He wasn't just some

00:18:39,357 --> 00:18:40,826
random pickup.

00:18:40,892 --> 00:18:43,395
At first I thought maybe she was
working on a book or something.

00:18:43,461 --> 00:18:44,729
Then I hit this.

00:18:44,796 --> 00:18:46,832
Day two.

00:18:46,898 --> 00:18:48,400
You threw four touchdowns
that game,

00:18:48,466 --> 00:18:49,434
didn't you?

00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:50,735
And ran for one
from right here.

00:18:50,802 --> 00:18:52,971
Everybody was thinking pass...

00:18:54,573 --> 00:18:56,975
I ran it right up the middle
for six.

00:18:57,042 --> 00:18:58,410
Sounds amazing.

00:18:58,477 --> 00:19:00,946
I wish I could
have been there with you.

00:19:01,012 --> 00:19:03,448
Is it just me or does it
sound like she's in love

00:19:03,515 --> 00:19:04,516
with this guy?

00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:05,817
Maybe she was a murder groupie.

00:19:05,884 --> 00:19:07,652
Hey, Manson,

00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:10,155
the Night Stalker--
all those guys had them.

00:19:10,222 --> 00:19:13,525
I think for some freaks,
killing's a turn-on, you know?

00:19:14,826 --> 00:19:16,495
Well, check this out.

00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:18,296
Day before
the murder.

00:19:18,363 --> 00:19:20,131
Last thing on her tapes.

00:19:20,198 --> 00:19:21,900
Well, this is an apartment

00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:26,638
and it is the right address, so
I guess I'm just waiting here.

00:19:26,705 --> 00:19:28,507
Let's go. Let's go.

00:19:28,573 --> 00:19:29,808
Start the car.

00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,676
Jason,
what happened?

00:19:31,743 --> 00:19:32,677
( <i>spitting</i> )

00:19:32,744 --> 00:19:33,678
I don't want
to talk about it.

00:19:33,745 --> 00:19:34,746
This about
Jesus Carden...

00:19:34,813 --> 00:19:37,249
Jesus Cardenas
is a scumbag convict,

00:19:37,315 --> 00:19:39,117
and we're not talking about him.

00:19:39,184 --> 00:19:40,452
Okay, I'm sorry.

00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:41,686
Shut that thing off.

00:19:41,753 --> 00:19:44,422
Run Jesus through NCIC.

00:19:44,489 --> 00:19:46,525
Cardenas.

00:19:49,094 --> 00:19:51,463
Jesus Cardenas.

00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,532
Heroin,
possession for sale

00:19:53,598 --> 00:19:54,633
and manslaughter.

00:19:54,699 --> 00:19:56,034
Currently serving 25

00:19:56,101 --> 00:19:58,203
at the Western Nevada
Correctional Facility.

00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,339
The former residence
of Jason Kent.

00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:06,778
Look, I'm pretty tired.

00:20:06,845 --> 00:20:09,080
WILLOWS:
This won't take long, Greg.
We promise.

00:20:09,147 --> 00:20:11,616
BROWN:
Why don't you tell us
exactly what happened.

00:20:11,683 --> 00:20:13,518
As best as you can remember.

00:20:13,585 --> 00:20:16,988
I was working
three cases.

00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:17,989
Mixing solvents.

00:20:18,056 --> 00:20:18,990
Did you
notice anything

00:20:19,057 --> 00:20:20,525
prior to the explosion?

00:20:20,592 --> 00:20:22,160
A power surge,

00:20:22,227 --> 00:20:24,563
a spark, a smell?

00:20:24,629 --> 00:20:25,864
Plastic.

00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:29,401
Burning plastic.

00:20:29,467 --> 00:20:31,703
<i>I turned around to see</i>
<i>where it was coming from.</i>

00:20:35,073 --> 00:20:36,741
After that...

00:20:38,643 --> 00:20:40,645
I'm sorry.

00:20:40,712 --> 00:20:42,681
It's okay.

00:20:42,747 --> 00:20:43,882
We done?

00:20:43,949 --> 00:20:45,650
Yeah, we're done.

00:20:45,717 --> 00:20:47,652
Feel better, all right?

00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:48,920
Get some rest.

00:20:50,555 --> 00:20:53,191
( <i>printing</i> )

00:21:55,053 --> 00:21:57,289
STOKES:
Jesus Cardenas
and Jason Kent

00:21:57,355 --> 00:21:59,958
were two prisoners with
the same taste in visitors.

00:22:00,025 --> 00:22:01,626
Alison Carpenter.

00:22:01,693 --> 00:22:04,863
Yeah, she visited Jason
13 times in the last 18 months.

00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,632
And the last two times,
she also visited Jesus.

00:22:07,699 --> 00:22:10,168
GRISSOM:
A murderer,
his groupie

00:22:10,235 --> 00:22:12,037
and a heroin dealer,
what a team.

00:22:12,103 --> 00:22:13,071
Mm.

00:22:13,138 --> 00:22:14,372
Does Western Nevada
Correctional

00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:16,508
use surveillance cameras
in their visitation room?

00:22:16,575 --> 00:22:19,177
Yeah, and it's all cued up.

00:22:20,846 --> 00:22:23,782
JOHNSON:
It's pretty casual for prison.

00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:25,083
It's medium security.

00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,418
Nicer criminals.

00:22:26,485 --> 00:22:27,886
Right.

00:22:27,953 --> 00:22:29,221
Anyway, every time we visit

00:22:29,287 --> 00:22:30,789
it pretty much went
the same way.

00:22:30,856 --> 00:22:33,758
She sits down with Jason Kent,
they talk for a little while,

00:22:33,825 --> 00:22:35,994
and Kent goes back to his cell.

00:22:36,061 --> 00:22:37,829
Then the last two visits,

00:22:37,896 --> 00:22:40,866
she stayed behind.

00:22:44,402 --> 00:22:45,871
Jesus Cardenas.

00:22:47,739 --> 00:22:51,409
JOHNSON:
They're offscreen here
for about five minutes.

00:22:51,476 --> 00:22:53,678
Then they come back to the table

00:22:53,745 --> 00:22:55,046
and she leaves.

00:22:55,113 --> 00:22:56,348
Run that again.

00:23:00,452 --> 00:23:01,553
Can you enhance that?

00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,687
Yeah, I think so.

00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:13,899
Jason's little girlfriend
was screwing a guy he hates.

00:23:13,965 --> 00:23:16,001
Well, if you can't kill
the one you want...

00:23:17,969 --> 00:23:20,105
kill the one you're with.

00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,577
What a mess.

00:23:25,644 --> 00:23:27,779
Want to strip it?

00:23:27,846 --> 00:23:30,248
I'm thinking spiral
with an overlap.

00:23:30,315 --> 00:23:32,250
I'll head this way.

00:23:32,317 --> 00:23:33,718
All right.

00:24:28,206 --> 00:24:30,942
Damage radiates from here.

00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:33,578
Well... there's no crater.

00:24:35,213 --> 00:24:37,349
Yeah, so it's not
a high explosive.

00:24:37,415 --> 00:24:39,351
I guess we're looking
for a combustible liquid?

00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:40,752
Yeah. That narrows things down.

00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:41,820
Yeah.

00:24:43,488 --> 00:24:45,524
Oh.

00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,793
Somebody left the hot plate on
inside of the fume hood.

00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,862
Genius.

00:24:59,671 --> 00:25:01,673
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,278
What do you think?

00:25:07,445 --> 00:25:09,114
Developer pan?

00:25:09,181 --> 00:25:11,383
Presence of acetone, methanol,
all kinds of combustibles.

00:25:11,449 --> 00:25:13,285
Mix that with a heat source,
and what have you got?

00:25:13,351 --> 00:25:15,453
This.

00:25:31,837 --> 00:25:34,072
Hey.

00:25:35,907 --> 00:25:37,375
You back on?

00:25:37,442 --> 00:25:38,677
Yeah.

00:25:38,743 --> 00:25:40,212
I hear you're going to prison.

00:25:40,278 --> 00:25:42,614
Hmm.

00:25:42,681 --> 00:25:44,783
Why don't you come along?

00:25:59,231 --> 00:26:01,433
( <i>explosion</i> )

00:26:11,576 --> 00:26:13,578
STOKES:
<i>What can you tell us</i>

00:26:13,645 --> 00:26:15,113
about Alison Carpenter?

00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,115
Knew her real well,

00:26:17,182 --> 00:26:20,051
but I guess
you already know that.

00:26:21,486 --> 00:26:23,021
How did you like the show?

00:26:23,088 --> 00:26:24,990
Alison Carpenter is dead.

00:26:25,056 --> 00:26:26,992
I got an alibi.

00:26:27,058 --> 00:26:29,728
Yeah, you're completely
innocent, and so, tell me,

00:26:29,794 --> 00:26:31,997
why would a woman
like Alison Carpenter,

00:26:32,063 --> 00:26:33,398
who was obsessed
with Jason Kent,

00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:34,699
have anything to do with you?

00:26:34,766 --> 00:26:36,368
STOKES:
You remember Jason.

00:26:36,434 --> 00:26:37,569
Two cells down.

00:26:37,636 --> 00:26:39,371
Hates your guts.

00:26:39,437 --> 00:26:40,806
A lot of anger in that boy.

00:26:40,872 --> 00:26:42,340
Not much sense.

00:26:42,407 --> 00:26:44,609
Doesn't understand
how things work.

00:26:44,676 --> 00:26:45,744
In here or out there?

00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:46,912
Either way.

00:26:46,978 --> 00:26:48,213
It doesn't matter.

00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,182
This is still
the U.S. of A., my man.

00:26:50,248 --> 00:26:51,883
It's capitalism.

00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,885
Every one us a buyer or seller.

00:26:53,952 --> 00:26:55,921
Which one was Alison?

00:26:55,987 --> 00:26:58,256
Exchange of goods for services.

00:26:58,323 --> 00:27:02,527
I gave Jason credit,
he walks out of here in debt.

00:27:02,594 --> 00:27:04,229
Thinks because he's
on the outside,

00:27:04,296 --> 00:27:05,397
he don't have to pay.

00:27:05,463 --> 00:27:07,299
Man who doesn't

00:27:07,365 --> 00:27:10,135
pay his debt undermines
the whole system.

00:27:10,202 --> 00:27:11,470
What did he owe you for?

00:27:12,504 --> 00:27:14,573
STOKES:
<i>We pulled Jason Kent's</i>

00:27:14,639 --> 00:27:15,740
disciplinary
file.

00:27:15,807 --> 00:27:17,209
He spent some
time in solitary.

00:27:17,275 --> 00:27:18,610
His CO caught
him with heroin

00:27:18,677 --> 00:27:19,878
on two separate
occasions.

00:27:19,945 --> 00:27:22,314
Once in, uh, '97
and again in '99.

00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,249
Did our lab examine
the physical evidence?

00:27:24,316 --> 00:27:25,884
Yeah, we pulled
those records, too.

00:27:25,951 --> 00:27:28,053
The analysis had yielded
a black tar heroin

00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:30,922
<i>with trace amounts</i>
<i>of blue and red linen fibers.</i>

00:27:38,964 --> 00:27:40,499
Linen? In a prison?

00:27:40,565 --> 00:27:42,300
You know, they got him
on the heroin once.

00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:43,869
They didn't follow up
with the trace.

00:27:43,935 --> 00:27:45,470
So how did Jason Kent get
the heroin?

00:27:45,537 --> 00:27:46,738
STOKES:
Uh...

00:27:46,805 --> 00:27:48,373
you-you know how these guys are.

00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,143
All they do 24/7 is figure out
how to beat the system.

00:27:51,209 --> 00:27:53,445
We figure the drugs probably
came from Jesus.

00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:54,913
So what are we saying?

00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,915
Jesus sells Jason Kent heroin.

00:27:56,982 --> 00:27:58,350
Kent falls into debt,

00:27:58,416 --> 00:28:00,986
and pays him off
with Alison Carpenter?

00:28:01,052 --> 00:28:02,554
I'll-I'll get
the money somehow.

00:28:02,621 --> 00:28:04,556
I'll work another
shift, and we'll...

00:28:04,623 --> 00:28:07,659
pay him later.

00:28:07,726 --> 00:28:09,261
I owe him.

00:28:09,327 --> 00:28:13,832
And one way or another,
he's going to collect.

00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:17,536
I'll do whatever I have to do.

00:28:17,602 --> 00:28:19,604
Yeah, they passed her around
like a party favor.

00:28:19,671 --> 00:28:21,606
Actually...

00:28:21,673 --> 00:28:23,775
she passed
around herself.

00:28:25,777 --> 00:28:27,779
Hmm.

00:28:27,846 --> 00:28:30,182
We understand that you handled
a meth lab yesterday.

00:28:30,248 --> 00:28:31,349
Contaminated
filter papers.

00:28:31,416 --> 00:28:33,351
So what?

00:28:33,418 --> 00:28:35,120
So, you had
to do a solvent extraction?

00:28:35,187 --> 00:28:36,321
What did you use?

00:28:36,388 --> 00:28:39,457
Chloroform, methanol
and acetone.

00:28:39,524 --> 00:28:41,459
I cleaned the pan.

00:28:41,526 --> 00:28:44,496
Same way you turned
off that hot plate?

00:28:44,563 --> 00:28:46,131
If it was on,
it wasn't my fault.

00:28:46,198 --> 00:28:48,767
That thing gets turned on
by accident all the time.

00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,075
Mysterious dude defense.

00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,012
Well, our report is going
to reflect the fact

00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:03,381
that an active heat source
was under the fume hood.

00:29:11,323 --> 00:29:13,258
I know what this is.

00:29:13,325 --> 00:29:16,127
You guys hear the lies
and rumors about me from L.A.

00:29:16,194 --> 00:29:18,330
You know
how much Grissom depends on me.

00:29:18,396 --> 00:29:19,498
So you figure,

00:29:19,564 --> 00:29:21,166
let's get
rid of him.

00:29:21,233 --> 00:29:24,035
I'll lawyer up before I let you
pin the tail on the new donkey.

00:29:24,102 --> 00:29:25,637
Start dialing.

00:29:27,506 --> 00:29:30,375
WOMAN:
Partial from your vic's
ankle on the left.

00:29:30,442 --> 00:29:31,910
Jason Kent on the right.

00:29:31,977 --> 00:29:33,745
One point of commonality?

00:29:33,812 --> 00:29:36,515
That's it.

00:29:36,581 --> 00:29:37,816
So it's not his print?

00:29:37,883 --> 00:29:39,451
Couldn't be.

00:29:39,518 --> 00:29:41,520
'Cause it belongs
to another guy.

00:29:41,586 --> 00:29:43,255
Ten points of commonality.

00:29:43,321 --> 00:29:45,190
I think I could get a couple

00:29:45,257 --> 00:29:48,593
of more,
not that we need it.

00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,195
Miguel Dorado.

00:29:50,262 --> 00:29:52,430
Mickey D.

00:29:52,497 --> 00:29:54,833
Las Culebras.

00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:00,305
What's the connection?

00:30:00,372 --> 00:30:02,073
Jesus Cardenas

00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,308
is in the same game.

00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:04,843
Mickey D. could be the guy

00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,379
who's getting the heroin
into the prison.

00:30:07,445 --> 00:30:09,881
How did his prints turn up
at the scene?

00:30:09,948 --> 00:30:12,984
I'm not sure how, but I
may see a potential why.

00:30:14,286 --> 00:30:19,090
<i>Could be Mickey D. is</i>
<i>collecting Jason Kent's debt.</i>

( <i>sighs</i> )

00:30:26,064 --> 00:30:28,900
One way or another,
you got to pay what you owe.

00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:31,403
Suze can't wait
to see you again.

00:30:32,971 --> 00:30:34,439
Jason Kent

00:30:34,506 --> 00:30:37,008
was suitable for framing.

00:31:37,903 --> 00:31:39,137
Hey.

00:31:39,204 --> 00:31:41,673
Hey.

00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,009
Oh, you work fast.

00:31:45,744 --> 00:31:49,014
Which color charts
Hodges' developer pan?

00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,382
Blue.

00:31:50,448 --> 00:31:51,683
The blue.

00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,718
That's 180-degree array.

00:31:53,785 --> 00:31:56,655
That's not the epicenter
of the explosion.

00:31:56,721 --> 00:31:57,989
Hodges' pan wasn't the source.

00:31:58,056 --> 00:31:59,257
It got pushed out.

00:32:01,626 --> 00:32:03,562
By what?

00:32:07,065 --> 00:32:10,268
By this.
The primary frag.

00:32:10,612 --> 00:32:11,486
The green glass.

00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,212
Then who blew up the lab?

00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:22,414
I did.

00:32:28,711 --> 00:32:31,281
( <i>TV playing in distance</i> )

00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,402
Las Vegas Police!

You. Go. Go. Go. There.

00:33:00,268 --> 00:33:01,000

( <i>grunting</i> )

You got him?
Got him.

00:33:13,349 --> 00:33:14,316
Okay.

00:33:14,383 --> 00:33:15,317
Holster your weapon.

00:33:15,384 --> 00:33:16,318
What were you doing?

00:33:16,385 --> 00:33:17,319
What were you thinking?

00:33:17,386 --> 00:33:19,321
You know that we clear
the room, not you.

00:33:19,388 --> 00:33:21,423
I got him.

00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,125
You're all done, <i>hombre.</i>

00:33:34,267 --> 00:33:36,303
( <i>sighs</i> )

( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:46,530
Grissom.

00:33:46,597 --> 00:33:49,033
WOMAN:
Director Covallo
is ready to see you.

00:33:49,099 --> 00:33:51,101
Okay, thank you.

00:33:54,305 --> 00:33:57,408
CSI Brown and I
had collected evidence on a case

00:33:57,474 --> 00:34:00,411
involving a woman
whose husband had collapsed.

00:34:00,477 --> 00:34:01,779
We suspected poison.

00:34:01,845 --> 00:34:03,747
When we returned
to the lab...

00:34:03,814 --> 00:34:05,649
You hadn't identified
the liquid?

00:34:05,716 --> 00:34:07,651
Not yet, no.

00:34:07,718 --> 00:34:09,253
And it was consumed
in the explosion

00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,055
so I guess we'll never know
what it was.

00:34:11,121 --> 00:34:13,624
In any event,
you placed

00:34:13,691 --> 00:34:16,560
this unidentified chemical
under the fume hood.

00:34:16,627 --> 00:34:17,561
Right.

00:34:17,628 --> 00:34:19,129
Next to an active heat source.

00:34:19,196 --> 00:34:20,331
I didn't know that
at the time.

00:34:20,397 --> 00:34:21,365
Because you didn't check.

00:34:25,903 --> 00:34:28,672
Unlogged evidence gets placed
under the fume hood.

00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,107
A hot plate was left on.

00:34:30,174 --> 00:34:31,275
It's a lab.
It's nobody's fault.

00:34:31,342 --> 00:34:32,276
It's my
responsibility.

00:34:32,343 --> 00:34:33,310
I didn't follow procedure.

00:34:33,377 --> 00:34:34,612
Why not?

00:34:35,646 --> 00:34:37,514
Because there's 24 hours
in the day

00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:39,416
and I'm pulling 16
for the County,

00:34:39,483 --> 00:34:41,318
spending three
pretending to sleep

00:34:41,385 --> 00:34:44,521
and the other five
lying to my daughter
that everything's

00:34:44,588 --> 00:34:45,956
going to be all right.

00:34:46,023 --> 00:34:48,158
There were 13 active cases
in DNA.

00:34:48,225 --> 00:34:50,694
They are all now tainted
or destroyed.

00:34:50,761 --> 00:34:52,730
What do you want to hear?

00:34:52,796 --> 00:34:54,665
I screwed up.
I'm sorry.

00:34:54,732 --> 00:34:55,799
"Sorry" doesn't cut it.

00:34:55,866 --> 00:34:56,834
You're on suspension.

00:34:56,901 --> 00:34:58,068
Five days unpaid leave.

00:35:02,206 --> 00:35:03,307
Grissom.

00:35:03,374 --> 00:35:04,675
We're not done here.

00:35:04,742 --> 00:35:06,176
I've heard rumors

00:35:06,243 --> 00:35:09,346
that you've been kicking back
Willows' reports.

00:35:09,413 --> 00:35:10,481
One report.

00:35:10,547 --> 00:35:11,649
The Jenkins case.

00:35:11,715 --> 00:35:12,750
She made a miscalculation.

00:35:12,816 --> 00:35:14,318
I've asked her to reissue
the report.

00:35:14,385 --> 00:35:15,653
Great.

00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:16,787
Well, while you're at it,

00:35:16,854 --> 00:35:18,689
maybe she can reissue
the lab explosion.

00:35:20,457 --> 00:35:21,992
Let me explain something to you.

00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:23,360
Every one of us

00:35:23,427 --> 00:35:24,995
( <i>audio fading</i> ):
in this building,
all of us...

00:35:25,062 --> 00:35:27,431
( <i>no audio</i> )

00:35:28,465 --> 00:35:30,234
Robert.

00:35:31,435 --> 00:35:33,571
If you have something to say
to me, say it to my face.

00:35:33,637 --> 00:35:34,838
Okay.

00:35:34,905 --> 00:35:37,641
It's not your job
to protect your people.

00:35:37,708 --> 00:35:40,578
It's to protect the integrity
of this lab.

00:35:40,644 --> 00:35:42,012
Without the people...

00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,948
there is no lab.

00:36:00,364 --> 00:36:04,101
I hear you think you're
indestructible now, Sara.

00:36:06,937 --> 00:36:09,640
Have you ever had a gun drawn
on you, Sara?

00:36:09,707 --> 00:36:11,842
No, I haven't.

00:36:32,363 --> 00:36:33,297
Hey, Nick.

00:36:33,364 --> 00:36:36,200
Know those red and blue
fibers we found

00:36:36,267 --> 00:36:38,002
in Jason Kent's heroin?

00:36:38,068 --> 00:36:39,236
Mm-hmm.

00:36:39,303 --> 00:36:40,704
I think I know
where they came from.

00:36:59,023 --> 00:37:01,926
Take the G.W. Bridge?

00:37:01,992 --> 00:37:03,627
I don't know

00:37:03,694 --> 00:37:05,329
what you're talking
about.

00:37:08,265 --> 00:37:09,300
Did you cut yourself shaving

00:37:09,366 --> 00:37:10,701
or were you just thinking
too hard?

00:37:10,768 --> 00:37:11,802
Police brutality.

00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:13,137
You ever hear of it?

00:37:13,203 --> 00:37:15,539
Those are human bite marks.

00:37:15,606 --> 00:37:16,974
Yeah?

00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:18,208
His.

00:37:19,243 --> 00:37:21,579
You're not looking
at assault, Mick.

00:37:21,645 --> 00:37:23,314
You're looking at murder.

00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,215
What?

00:37:25,282 --> 00:37:27,451
You have Jason Kent's
teeth marks on your head.

00:37:30,387 --> 00:37:33,357
( <i>groaning</i> )

00:37:33,424 --> 00:37:34,792
STOKES:
And your fingerprints

00:37:34,858 --> 00:37:36,727
are on Alison Carpenter's body.

00:37:36,794 --> 00:37:39,897
You're not putting
this murder rap on me.

00:37:39,964 --> 00:37:41,799
It was that freak Jason.

00:37:41,865 --> 00:37:43,334
He did it.

00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,135
We're placing you
at the scene.

00:37:45,202 --> 00:37:46,870
Yeah.

00:37:46,937 --> 00:37:48,672
I was there...

00:37:48,739 --> 00:37:50,341
for the money.

00:37:50,407 --> 00:37:51,976
I told him
that he had one day

00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:53,744
to pay up what he owed.

00:37:53,811 --> 00:37:56,280
Make everything right
with Jesus.

00:37:56,347 --> 00:37:57,982
That's it.

00:38:00,584 --> 00:38:02,353
You know, it's not a bad deal
for prison.

00:38:02,419 --> 00:38:04,355
Mickey D. brings the heroin
to Jesus Cardenas

00:38:04,421 --> 00:38:07,224
and you trade him
a woman for smack.

00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:09,193
Testimony
from Mickey D.?

00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,262
Hearsay from
a gangbanger?

00:38:11,328 --> 00:38:12,663
Oh, there's more.

00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,265
You left prison
without paying your tab

00:38:14,331 --> 00:38:16,400
and when Jesus sent
his collection agency after you,

00:38:16,467 --> 00:38:17,701
you figured you'd pay him back

00:38:17,768 --> 00:38:19,003
just the way you
did in the joint.

00:38:19,069 --> 00:38:20,237
GRISSOM:
We know that
you had sex

00:38:20,304 --> 00:38:22,273
with Alison Carpenter
that night.

00:38:22,339 --> 00:38:24,074
Most probably in her car.

00:38:24,141 --> 00:38:25,943
BRASS:
Get her in the mood.

00:38:27,244 --> 00:38:28,646
I want you to do
something for me.

00:38:28,712 --> 00:38:29,880
Anything you want.

00:38:29,947 --> 00:38:31,715
Good, come on.

00:38:37,655 --> 00:38:38,923
This get us square?

00:38:38,989 --> 00:38:39,990
Yeah.

00:38:40,057 --> 00:38:41,725
For now.

00:38:41,792 --> 00:38:43,560
Take care of him.

00:38:43,627 --> 00:38:45,629
No, I don't want to.

00:38:45,696 --> 00:38:47,698
You said you'd help me.

00:38:47,765 --> 00:38:49,633
I did help you.

00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,668
Alison,
just one time.

00:38:50,734 --> 00:38:51,735
Come on.
No!

00:38:54,138 --> 00:38:57,575
( <i>hands pounding on walls</i> )

00:38:57,641 --> 00:38:59,310
( <i>pounding continues</i> )

00:38:59,376 --> 00:39:01,712
( <i>squeaking</i> )

00:39:01,779 --> 00:39:04,348
( <i>pounding stops</i> )

00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,456
You're in on this.

00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:25,536
You're going back
in the joint, freak.

00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:28,472
You can't prove
any of this.

00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:31,141
You have no evidence that places
my client at the scene.

00:39:32,176 --> 00:39:34,311
Would you place your hand--
your right hand--

00:39:34,378 --> 00:39:36,046
on this paper, please?

00:39:42,753 --> 00:39:44,021
Extend the fingers outward.

00:39:44,088 --> 00:39:45,456
ATTORNEY:
You have a known

00:39:45,522 --> 00:39:47,358
gang member
in custody and yet

00:39:47,424 --> 00:39:49,159
you persist
in harassing my client.

00:39:49,226 --> 00:39:50,861
You're protective, aren't you?

00:39:50,928 --> 00:39:52,997
Of my clients.

00:39:53,063 --> 00:39:55,499
Do you pay the rent
for all your clients

00:39:55,566 --> 00:39:57,801
or just the ones
you really like?

00:39:59,837 --> 00:40:04,675
Mickey D... has a hand
span of 19 centimeters.

00:40:06,543 --> 00:40:08,879
The hand that strangled

00:40:08,946 --> 00:40:12,683
Alison Carpenter...
has a span of 22 centimeters.

00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:22,559
And your hand...

00:40:23,594 --> 00:40:26,163
...22 centimeters.

00:40:40,611 --> 00:40:41,879
You going to go
to the DA

00:40:41,946 --> 00:40:43,314
with a connect-
the-dots hand

00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,715
on a piece of
tracing paper?

00:40:44,782 --> 00:40:46,850
It's all we got
that links him to the murder.

00:40:46,917 --> 00:40:48,552
Everything else blew up
in the lab.

00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:51,055
The guy's
going to walk.

00:40:51,121 --> 00:40:53,023
Yep.

00:40:57,928 --> 00:41:00,431
( <i>groans</i> )

00:41:06,837 --> 00:41:09,039
What time is it?

00:41:09,106 --> 00:41:11,842
Late.

00:41:11,909 --> 00:41:13,877
How long have you been here?

00:41:13,944 --> 00:41:15,679
A while.

00:41:15,746 --> 00:41:18,249
I got a little time on my hands.

00:41:23,153 --> 00:41:25,923
You figured out what happened
in the lab, didn't you?

00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,459
Yeah.

00:41:31,495 --> 00:41:33,030
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:41:33,097 --> 00:41:36,700
Yeah, and, um...

00:41:36,767 --> 00:41:40,771
I wanted you
to hear it from me.

00:41:54,351 --> 00:41:55,619
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:41:55,686 --> 00:41:57,621
You... got a minute?

00:41:57,688 --> 00:41:58,956
I was just leaving.

00:41:59,023 --> 00:42:00,557
Yeah, the,
uh, schedule

00:42:00,624 --> 00:42:01,926
says you're off tonight.

00:42:01,992 --> 00:42:03,160
I am.

00:42:03,227 --> 00:42:04,161
Me, too.

00:42:04,228 --> 00:42:05,629
You should be
on paid leave.

00:42:05,696 --> 00:42:07,598
I'm fine.

00:42:07,665 --> 00:42:08,832
You were fortunate.

00:42:08,899 --> 00:42:10,601
And I'm not talking
about the explosion.

00:42:10,668 --> 00:42:13,170
You, uh, you talked to Brass?

00:42:13,237 --> 00:42:14,638
And Nick.

00:42:14,705 --> 00:42:16,006
We got the guy.

00:42:16,073 --> 00:42:18,175
Is that all you have to say?

00:42:18,242 --> 00:42:20,844
Would you like to
have dinner with me?

00:42:21,879 --> 00:42:23,981
No.

00:42:24,048 --> 00:42:25,182
Why not?

00:42:25,249 --> 00:42:27,217
Let's... let's have dinner.

00:42:27,284 --> 00:42:28,986
Let's see what happens.

00:42:29,053 --> 00:42:31,522
Sara...

00:42:31,589 --> 00:42:33,924
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:42:35,259 --> 00:42:38,696
I don't know what to do
about this.

00:42:38,762 --> 00:42:41,332
I do.

00:42:43,734 --> 00:42:46,437
You know, by the time
you figure it out,

00:42:46,503 --> 00:42:48,472
you really could
be too late.
