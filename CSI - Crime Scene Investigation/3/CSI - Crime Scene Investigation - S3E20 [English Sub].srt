Look, look, the Kennedys
killed Marilyn Monroe.

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,889
I'm pretty sure the gunman
in the grassy knoll

00:00:14,956 --> 00:00:17,325
was either Arthur Miller
or Joe DiMaggio.

00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,359
"Bang my wife...?"

I'd ask you to marry me.

Hell, somebody's got
to clean my apartment."

00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,335

00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,370

All right.

the Bill of Rights?

00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,975
That's-that's-that's...

00:00:34,042 --> 00:00:36,311
Who cares?
It's really not that important.

00:00:36,377 --> 00:00:37,679

"You know, if it wasn't
for the US,

00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,091

00:00:53,394 --> 00:00:55,430
Yeah, well, if it,
if it wasn't for the French,

00:00:55,496 --> 00:00:57,565
you'd be speaking Cherokee.

00:01:00,768 --> 00:01:02,370
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I hurt your brains?

00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,638

Yeah. Laugh.

<i>It recently came out that</i>
<i>Jesus could've had siblings.</i>

00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,709
Could you imagine growing up
having Jesus in your family?

00:01:25,776 --> 00:01:27,611
"Why can't you be
more like your brother?"

00:01:27,678 --> 00:01:29,112
What's up, dude?

00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:31,014
"Uh, 'cause he's the Messiah.
He's the son of God."

00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:32,115
Hi, Lis. All right.

00:01:32,182 --> 00:01:33,000
"When your brother's home,

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,458
we always have wine."

00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:36,126
Caught your act
on the tube
last night.

00:01:36,193 --> 00:01:37,127
You knocked
them out.

00:01:37,194 --> 00:01:38,128
I had to turn up
the volume,

00:01:38,195 --> 00:01:39,129
I was laughing
so loud.

00:01:39,196 --> 00:01:40,397
This art exhibit get any laughs?

00:01:40,464 --> 00:01:42,533
Hey, come on, you're
my only headliner,
you know that.

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,870
Well, I'm Michael Borland,
and that's my time...

00:01:47,037 --> 00:01:49,640

( <i>cheering and applause</i> )

00:02:32,116 --> 00:02:33,751
Ain't it great? Bam!

00:02:33,817 --> 00:02:35,586
Welcome to The Tragedy Hall.

00:02:35,653 --> 00:02:39,189
Hey, you hear the one about
the comedian who died onstage?

00:02:39,256 --> 00:02:40,591
Literally.
Bud-um-bum.

00:02:40,658 --> 00:02:41,992
I'll be here all week.

00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:44,094
Maybe he slipped
on a banana peel.

00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:46,196
Bud-um-bum.
Hmm.

00:02:46,263 --> 00:02:48,999
BRASS:
<i>Crowd thought</i>
<i>it was part of his act...</i>

00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:50,434
<i>till he didn't get up.</i>

00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:51,802
Hi, David.

00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:53,971
Hey, Catherine.

00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,108
Well, there's no foam
on the mouth.

00:02:58,175 --> 00:03:01,845
No discoloration
around the lips.

00:03:01,912 --> 00:03:03,414
Pupils aren't dilated.

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,016
No overt evidence
of a drug overdose.

00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,384
When was the last time

00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:09,453
a comedian died
of natural causes?

00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,888
Clenched fist...

00:03:10,955 --> 00:03:12,389
classic Levine sign.

00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:14,191
He's awfully young
for a heart attack.

00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:15,993
BRASS:
Well, live fast,

00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,962
I forget the rest.
Excuse me!

00:03:18,028 --> 00:03:19,930
Could someone turn down
the house lights,

00:03:19,997 --> 00:03:21,398
and turn up the stage lights?

00:03:21,465 --> 00:03:23,634
Thank you.

00:03:23,701 --> 00:03:27,938
I want to see what <i>he</i> saw...
right before he died.

00:03:29,607 --> 00:03:31,041
What do you see?

00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:33,577
Nothing.

to a better place.

Sorry, Alan. I didn't see you.

At least Dougie put laughter
in the air

00:04:28,378 --> 00:04:30,080
and asses in the seats
and drinks on the tabs.

00:04:31,215 --> 00:04:33,183
I loved that guy.

00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,374
Took me 15 years to find
the next Kinison,

00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:37,374
and the minute I do,
he gets a sitcom.

00:04:37,374 --> 00:04:38,222
Now I have to pay
him a king's ransom

00:04:38,288 --> 00:04:39,590
to come back here
once a year,

00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:41,158
and this is where
he started.

00:04:41,225 --> 00:04:42,993
( <i>laughs</i> ):
Figures the bastard
would die on me.

00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,162
You know, I-I should
put up a sign,

00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:48,432
you know, like
in Dealey Plaza,
"Kennedy Shot Here,"

00:04:48,499 --> 00:04:49,433
"Dougie Dropped Here."

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,968
Hey, Alan, you got
a spot open now.

00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:53,103
What do you say tomorrow
you give me some time?

00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,771
You got a job.
You want to keep it?

00:04:56,874 --> 00:04:58,475
Dougie was a hack
with hack material

00:04:58,542 --> 00:05:00,844
who caught a break
and never let anybody forget it.

00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:02,546
Oh, you want suspects?

00:05:02,613 --> 00:05:04,414
Here, check out
the wall.

00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:07,751
Any one of these guys'd kill
to have his stage.

00:05:58,068 --> 00:06:01,405
Oh, China.

00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,507
Six bottles of Innoko water.

00:06:03,574 --> 00:06:06,410
Three partially filled,
three unopened.

00:06:06,477 --> 00:06:08,178
Don't go Cousteau
on me here.

00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:09,947
It was all part
of his shtick.

00:06:10,013 --> 00:06:12,149
He was like Tarkanian
with the towel.

00:06:12,216 --> 00:06:14,251
You know, always
biting and pacing.

00:06:14,318 --> 00:06:15,686
Dougie's mantra was,

00:06:15,752 --> 00:06:18,388
"It's a cruel world.
Ain't it great?"

00:06:19,923 --> 00:06:22,493
Uh, it was low-brow.
Strictly chug-and-belch.

00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:25,462
Laughter is an involuntary
motor response

00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:27,564
triggered by survival issues:

00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:30,033
food, sex, body functions...
death.

00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,237
Yeah, it's a cruel world.

So, who has access
to the Green Room?

00:06:35,205 --> 00:06:36,440
Well, according to who?

00:06:36,507 --> 00:06:38,375
According to me,
just the talent.

00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:40,944
According to these
meat sticks-- the world.

00:06:41,011 --> 00:06:42,246
All right.

00:06:42,312 --> 00:06:45,249
I would like to see
everyone's wallet.

00:06:45,315 --> 00:06:47,885
I don't need to see
your identification.

00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:49,386
Just open
your wallets.

00:06:49,453 --> 00:06:53,924
Uh, it says I'm
180 pounds, but I'm 145.

00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:56,426
I know that,
in Nevada law,

00:06:56,493 --> 00:06:59,429
if there's a 25-pound
discrepancy, that...

00:06:59,496 --> 00:07:00,964
that's actually
against the law.
Thank you.

00:07:04,368 --> 00:07:06,770
Thanks.
Thank you.

00:07:06,837 --> 00:07:10,741
In this one
I'm wearing a thong.

00:07:10,807 --> 00:07:14,745
That's more than
I needed to know.

had more than comedy
in his blood.

Tox came back
positive for coke.

00:08:15,772 --> 00:08:20,577
The answer is... the three
main ways to take cocaine.

00:08:22,146 --> 00:08:25,115
All right, Alex.
What is snorting it,

00:08:25,182 --> 00:08:27,084
smoking it,
or injecting it?

00:08:27,151 --> 00:08:28,085
Very good.

00:08:28,152 --> 00:08:31,188
The answer is normal
nasal passages,

00:08:31,255 --> 00:08:35,092
clear lungs, and no
track marks on the body.

00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,960

childish metaphor,

get into his system?

00:09:05,756 --> 00:09:08,392
Well...

00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,594
Dougie always liked to do
a little hum-and-coke

00:09:10,661 --> 00:09:11,795
before a show.

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,342
Cocaine on the foreskin,
or any skin, for that matter,

00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:28,045
is not a stimulant;
it's a numbing agent.

00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:30,447
Right. That
was the idea.

00:09:30,514 --> 00:09:34,351
You see, the goal wasn't
to pop the cork.

00:09:34,418 --> 00:09:37,287
It was to...
shake the bottle.

00:09:37,354 --> 00:09:38,489
Sounds frustrating.

00:09:38,555 --> 00:09:41,391
Dougie liked to go out
on stage frustrated.

00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,061
I ran away from home at age 25.

00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:47,431
I drank... and I whored...
( <i>cheering</i> )

00:09:47,498 --> 00:09:48,732
...and I got my own show!

00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,900
( <i>cheering</i> )

00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:52,903
Yeah, <i>Dougie to the Max,</i>
bee-yatch!

00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,239
Gave him an edge.

00:09:55,305 --> 00:09:58,675
That was Dougie's philosophy:
go in hot...

00:09:58,742 --> 00:10:00,944
burn the place down.

00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,983
Oh, you're making coffee.
Good. I could use some.

00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:07,251
How do you take it?

00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:09,686
Today, high-octane black.

00:10:09,753 --> 00:10:12,856
I need your help with something.

00:10:12,923 --> 00:10:15,225
Shoot.

00:10:17,294 --> 00:10:18,562
A few weeks ago,

00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:21,598
Homicide gets called
to Green Valley.

00:10:21,665 --> 00:10:24,101
A woman in her 40s slips
in the bathtub and drowns.

00:10:24,168 --> 00:10:26,036
You know, cracked skull,
raccooned eyes--

00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:28,472
I mean, a traumatic death,
but nothing suspicious.

00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:30,107
CSI found what?

00:10:30,174 --> 00:10:32,676
I didn't call them in.
I ruled it an accident.

00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:34,892
What changed?

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,294
Last night I saw
the husband

00:10:37,361 --> 00:10:38,762
out on the town.

00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:39,458
I mean, I could tell
you something, Nick.

00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,460
Three weeks ago,
this guy was devastated.

00:10:41,527 --> 00:10:44,263
( <i>sobbing</i> ):
I should've been here.

00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,265
What am I going to do?

00:10:46,332 --> 00:10:49,535
I mean, she was my life.

00:10:49,602 --> 00:10:51,537
Onward and upward.

00:10:51,604 --> 00:10:52,872
No, but this is way upward.

00:10:52,938 --> 00:10:54,740
I mean, trades in
his beat-up old Acura

00:10:54,807 --> 00:10:55,941
for a brand-new Ferrari.

00:10:56,008 --> 00:10:57,910
He's with a girl
who gives more lift-off

00:10:57,977 --> 00:10:59,311
than-than Cape Canaveral.

00:10:59,378 --> 00:11:01,814
( <i>laughs</i> ):
People grieve
in different ways, man.

00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:03,149
No, I understand that.

00:11:03,215 --> 00:11:04,683
I got no problem with that.
I'm not a priest.

00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,986
That's why I called
the life insurance carrier.

00:11:07,053 --> 00:11:08,020
And check this out.

00:11:08,087 --> 00:11:10,322
The morning...
Shelley Stark...

00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:11,557
was found,

00:11:11,624 --> 00:11:14,994
George Stark made a call
to the life insurance agent.

00:11:15,061 --> 00:11:18,264
Went like this: "My wife
is dead. I want my money."

00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,333
I mean, just like that.
All in one breath.

00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,701
What's the payout?

00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,451
$750,000.

00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,053
Now, I got the police report,
autopsy protocol,

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,489
detective summary,
and scene photos.

00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,728
You sure you're not
looking for Grissom?

00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:38,631
I'm chasing something that Gil
Grissom isn't interested in--

00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,500
a hunch.

00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,402
I don't have to run any tests.

00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:46,005
You cannot absorb enough cocaine
through your penis to OD.

00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,107
Cite your source.

00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,575
I don't have a source.

00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,443
That's why we
did the tests.

00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,678
Whatever.

00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:53,880
All right, who wants it?

00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,450
Cocaine levels

00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:01,321
are less than .05 milligrams
per liter.

00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,823
Way too low.
That's not what killed him.

00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,824
So what did?

00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,493
Well, according
to your blood sample,

00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,494
naratriptamine.

00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,862
The new migraine medication?

00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,663
Mm-hmm. Powerful stuff.

00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,065
And what were the
levels in the vic?

00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:15,468
30 milligrams-- 12 times
the recommended dosage.

00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:19,039
Ooh. Dougie Max was poisoned.

00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,306
To the max.

00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:32,252
Cop shots.
No rulers, no markers.

00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:35,388
Just a bathroom,
a towel bar,
and a dead woman.

00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:41,261
Injuries are consistent
with an accident.

00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:44,030
Yeah, but the contusion
to the back of the head

00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,398
was not fatal.

00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,434
Abbreviated autopsy.

00:12:57,501 --> 00:12:59,303
Dr. Robbins oversaw.

00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,505
Cause of death: drowning.

00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,173
It jibes
with the husband's account.

00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,942
It jibes
with the detective's account.

00:13:05,008 --> 00:13:06,310
There is nothing in this file

00:13:06,377 --> 00:13:08,479
that suggests anything
other than an accident.

00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:09,613
I don't know, Sara...

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,015
other people's notes,
other people's photos,

00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,283
evidence twice-removed.

00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,219
No CSI ever even got
to look at it.

00:13:18,222 --> 00:13:20,157
Do you want to go
to the bathroom?

00:13:22,893 --> 00:13:24,528
Consumables from the club

00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,663
that matched
Dougie's stomach contents.

00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,832
We know that he had
naratriptamine

00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:30,067
in his system,

00:13:30,134 --> 00:13:32,002
and we also know
that the poison was ingested.

00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:34,705
Because Spam can't be absorbed
through the penis,

00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,840
and if you ask me
to cite my source...

00:13:36,907 --> 00:13:38,442
I'll take your word for it.

00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,998
Death by chocolate again?

00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,201
Hmm.

00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:16,947
STARK:
Miss,

00:14:17,014 --> 00:14:18,348
plea-please-please
don't get so close

00:14:18,415 --> 00:14:19,416
to the car,
all right?

00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,552
The alarm
is really delicate.

00:14:21,618 --> 00:14:24,555
We're not really
as concerned
with the car, sir.

00:14:24,621 --> 00:14:26,423
What we'd like to do
is look at your bathroom.

00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,725
Um, why, wha-what

00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,994
would you like
to look at the bathroom for?

00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:32,629
Like I said,
we're with the Crime Lab.

00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:35,432
We're here to tie up some loose
ends regarding your wife's case.

00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,402
I appreciate how thorough
you guys are being,

00:14:38,469 --> 00:14:41,939
but... I got...
I got to be honest.

00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:43,741
This is pretty painful
territory for me.
Right.

00:14:43,807 --> 00:14:46,410
I mean, it's still pretty hard
to get up in the morning

00:14:46,477 --> 00:14:47,578
without Shelley.
I understand...

00:14:47,644 --> 00:14:48,879
( <i>knocks on car,</i>
<i>alarm sounding</i> )

00:14:48,946 --> 00:14:50,914
Ma'am, miss,
I thought I...

00:14:50,981 --> 00:14:53,417
Sorry. I-I-I-I'm sorry.
I, uh...

00:14:55,152 --> 00:14:57,721
Your neighbors are looking.

00:14:57,788 --> 00:15:01,125
I'll get the keys.
Come on. Come on in.

00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,498
It smells like fresh paint.

00:15:07,564 --> 00:15:10,567
Yeah, I had
the whole place
redone this week.

00:15:10,634 --> 00:15:12,236
Bad memories.

00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:14,171
Did you replace the tub?

00:15:14,238 --> 00:15:15,372
No.

00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:16,673
But you replaced the fixtures.

00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,010
There used to be
a towel bar there.

00:15:20,077 --> 00:15:21,078
Yeah.

00:15:21,145 --> 00:15:22,713
Would you by any chance

00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,448
have the old towel bar
lying around somewhere?

00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:27,151
No, the contractor tossed it.
It was junk.

00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,485
Came with the house.

00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,921
This whole
subdivision
comes stock.

00:15:30,988 --> 00:15:32,089
In fact, the first thing

00:15:32,156 --> 00:15:33,691
the broker told me
when I bought it--

00:15:33,757 --> 00:15:34,725
if I ever want to sell,

00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:36,460
invest in upgrades.
You selling?

00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:38,696
Too big for one person.

00:15:40,264 --> 00:15:41,732
Thank you.

00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:45,102
Uh, thanks for your time.

00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:46,303
Mmm.

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,374
You pulled the plug
kind of early.

00:15:50,441 --> 00:15:51,909
What's going on?

00:15:51,975 --> 00:15:53,944
Yeah, that bathroom's
not the crime scene anymore.

00:15:54,011 --> 00:15:56,013
I say we go with
the next best thing.

00:15:57,815 --> 00:15:59,450
Model home.

00:15:59,516 --> 00:16:01,218
Model home.

00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:03,454
What do Socrates,
Edgar Allen Poe,

00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,756
and Dougie Max
have in common?

00:16:05,823 --> 00:16:07,925
They all drank themselves
to death.

00:16:07,991 --> 00:16:09,660
You've isolated the source
of the poison?

00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,095
Naratriptamine--

00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:14,031
Innoko water bottle
number three.

00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:19,536
( <i>cheering and applause</i> )

00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,171
Oh, God.

00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,042
What about the other bottles?

00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,477
Clean.

00:16:26,543 --> 00:16:30,881
Okay. I need you to process that
bottle for trace impurities.

00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,484
Got it. Anything that might've
mixed in with the poison

00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,519
could help us identify
the original source.

00:16:35,586 --> 00:16:37,254
We identify the source...

00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:39,356
maybe we identify the killer.

00:16:40,591 --> 00:16:42,126
Where are you going?

00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:43,727
To get a drink.

00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:52,569
75 units
with 75 identical floor plans.

00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:56,340
I never thought I'd be grateful
for cookie cutter homes.

00:16:56,407 --> 00:16:58,175
Like bees in a hive.
Gives me the creeps.

00:16:58,242 --> 00:16:59,843
You sure you
don't want me
to do this?

00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,311
Are you kidding?
I live for this.

00:17:01,378 --> 00:17:03,847
And Shelley Stark and I
are the same height and weight.

00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:06,650
Yeah, but you're
taller, thinner.

00:17:06,717 --> 00:17:09,186
Oh, butter that toast, Nick.

00:17:09,253 --> 00:17:11,221
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:17:11,288 --> 00:17:12,623
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,427
Okay, I'm Shelley Stark.

00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:21,065
My bath is over,
and I'm about to get out, so...

00:17:21,131 --> 00:17:24,234
I brace myself
with my left hand,

00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:26,704
and I'm getting up
at a 45-degree angle,

00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,940
and I slip... so, I grab
the first thing that I can.

00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:30,974
Towel bar.

00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,042
Towel bar.

00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:34,845
Okay.

00:17:34,912 --> 00:17:35,946
So, at this point,

00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:39,450
all of my weight
is being supported by this bar.

00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,418
And it doesn't budge.

00:17:41,485 --> 00:17:42,553
No.

00:17:45,322 --> 00:17:46,890
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:17:46,957 --> 00:17:48,025
You okay?

00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:50,160
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine...

00:17:50,227 --> 00:17:52,096
but this thing is coming down.

00:17:52,162 --> 00:17:53,197
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:17:53,263 --> 00:17:54,832
Okay.

00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,435
You sure you don't want me
to do that?

00:17:58,502 --> 00:17:59,636
No.

00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:00,704
( <i>grunting</i> )

00:18:00,771 --> 00:18:01,805
Okay.

00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,377
Sara.

00:18:06,443 --> 00:18:07,745
( <i>grunts</i> )

00:18:10,414 --> 00:18:11,482
There is no way

00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,617
that Shelley Stark
brought down this towel bar.

00:18:13,684 --> 00:18:15,953
You want me to give it a shot?

00:18:24,328 --> 00:18:27,531
( <i>rattling</i> )

00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:35,706
( <i>pants</i> )

00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:41,512
Someone took a lot of effort to
make this look like an accident.

00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,648
Yeah,
about $750,000 worth of effort.

00:18:44,715 --> 00:18:45,649
Okay, so you know

00:18:45,716 --> 00:18:47,217
the thing that drives me
crazy about men?

00:18:47,284 --> 00:18:49,119
You know how
they take the toilet paper,

00:18:49,186 --> 00:18:51,088
and then they put it up
on top of the holder.

00:18:51,155 --> 00:18:52,322
What is that?

00:18:52,389 --> 00:18:55,459
Do they not see that?

00:18:55,526 --> 00:18:57,661
Are they just busy looking
at their underwear on the floor?

00:18:57,728 --> 00:19:00,531
( <i>laughs</i> ):
I got a nickname for my man.

00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,399
I call him Mr. Drop-and-Stay,

00:19:02,466 --> 00:19:05,035
'cause if he drops it, man,
it just stays there.

00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,503
God, uh,

00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,971
ooh, well,

00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:09,373
and that's my time.

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,374
Uh, you've been

00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,042
14 quiet people,

00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:16,013
six empty tables,
and I'll see you in hell.

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,717
Modern version
of the old hook.

00:19:21,485 --> 00:19:23,887
Welcome to Open Mike Night,
guys. What can I get you?

00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,055
Information.

00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:28,058
Wow, your coffee stinks.

00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,427
Oh, really. I'm sorry
it's not up to the standards

00:19:30,494 --> 00:19:31,762
of your crap-ass home brew,

00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:34,531
but that'll be five bucks
all the same, my friend.

00:19:34,598 --> 00:19:36,767
Dougie Max's Innoko water
bottles that were on the stage

00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:37,835
his last performance--

00:19:37,901 --> 00:19:39,203
who set them up?

00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:40,904
Yours truly. Bartender.

00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,740
Mr. Max had very
acquired tastes.

00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:45,109
Lofty demands, you know.

00:19:45,175 --> 00:19:47,177
Six pristine
Innoko water bottles,

00:19:47,244 --> 00:19:48,912
labels all facing
the Luxor.

00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,114
And a Green Room?

00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,050
Forget it.
Silver tray, Spam, Choco Bees--

00:19:53,117 --> 00:19:54,151
all blue.

00:19:54,218 --> 00:19:55,519
Not-not to mention
that, uh,

00:19:55,586 --> 00:19:57,521
passionfruit stuff--
what is it, two bucks a pop?

00:19:57,588 --> 00:19:58,522
Try to find that stuff.

00:19:58,589 --> 00:20:00,691
Let's get back to the water.

00:20:00,758 --> 00:20:02,292
It was poisoned.

00:20:04,028 --> 00:20:05,029
Really?

00:20:05,095 --> 00:20:06,063
Mmm.

00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,965
The, uh, bottles
you took out to the stage--

00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:10,100
where'd they come from?

00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,403
That... Dougie's private stash.

00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:16,306
Well, besides you and Dougie,
who had access to it?

00:20:16,373 --> 00:20:19,643
Nobody's allowed behind the bar
besides the bar staff and me.

00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,446
But no one listens to him.
You got a bottle opener?

00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,114
Hey, that's going on your tab,
you leech.

00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,115
I'm scared.

00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,216
Well, you've got a temper...

00:20:26,283 --> 00:20:28,252
and a record.

00:20:28,318 --> 00:20:30,220
Assault. Club in Tucson.

00:20:30,287 --> 00:20:31,321
Yeah, I had a temper,

00:20:31,388 --> 00:20:32,923
until I kicked the crap
out of a heckler

00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,591
for interrupting
my closing bit.

00:20:34,658 --> 00:20:35,993
Do you get headaches?

00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,127
I'm getting one right now.

00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,096
We want all the Innoko water...

00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,166
to go.

00:20:48,272 --> 00:20:49,740
Warrick...

00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:51,241
this just in.

00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:53,177
D.B. at a convenience store
on Torrey Pines.

00:20:53,243 --> 00:20:54,211
You're all I got.

00:20:54,278 --> 00:20:56,880
I'm on it.

00:20:56,947 --> 00:20:57,881
Oh, hey, listen.

00:20:57,948 --> 00:20:59,550
I checked the bartender's
medical records.

00:20:59,616 --> 00:21:01,952
The guy's had six different
prescriptions for migraines

00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:02,986
in the last two years.

00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,154
Guess which one he's on now?

00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,255
Naratriptamine.

00:21:20,037 --> 00:21:21,572
I'm Warrick Brown from CSI.

00:21:21,638 --> 00:21:23,841
You want to tell me
what happened here?

00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,109
I don't know.

00:21:25,175 --> 00:21:27,344
Kid walks in.
He goes down an aisle.

00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,713
Next thing I know,
he drops dead.

00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:33,484
Where'd he start?

00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,587
He was pacing back and forth,
scoping the place out.

00:21:36,653 --> 00:21:38,021
I always spot
those kids.

00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,123
People don't know.

00:21:39,189 --> 00:21:41,458
You consume food or drink
in the store,

00:21:41,525 --> 00:21:43,093
it's the same
as shoplifting

00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,328
until you pay for it.

00:21:44,395 --> 00:21:45,329
What'd he steal?

00:21:45,396 --> 00:21:46,497
A beverage.

00:21:46,563 --> 00:21:48,432
He put it back before
I could catch him.

00:21:48,499 --> 00:21:50,200
Where?

00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,835
Over here.

00:22:10,154 --> 00:22:11,722
This isn't funny anymore.

00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,875
WILLOWS:
<i>We pulled 140 bottles</i>

00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:19,378
of Innoko water off the shelves
in this store alone.

00:22:19,445 --> 00:22:21,347
There's 500 convenience stores
in Vegas.

00:22:21,413 --> 00:22:23,749
We need to get this product
off the shelves now.

00:22:23,816 --> 00:22:25,884
Grocery stores,
restaurants, wholesalers...

00:22:25,951 --> 00:22:26,919
Right now,
it looks like

00:22:26,986 --> 00:22:28,821
only your Innoko water product
is involved.

00:22:28,887 --> 00:22:31,156
CSI is going to need the name
of any recent firings,

00:22:31,223 --> 00:22:33,025
anyone with a lawsuit
against the company,

00:22:33,092 --> 00:22:35,060
anyone who's made threats
against the company--

00:22:35,127 --> 00:22:36,362
anyone with an axe to grind.

00:22:36,428 --> 00:22:37,463
I know
that we risk panic,

00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:39,131
Chief, but I'd rather

00:22:39,198 --> 00:22:41,567
risk that
than have another victim.

00:22:41,634 --> 00:22:43,035
Hang on.

00:22:43,102 --> 00:22:45,104
We need to find out
what's in there.

00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,039
I'm back.

00:22:47,106 --> 00:22:48,140
Yeah.

00:22:48,207 --> 00:22:49,475
Right.

00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,628
I checked her
lungs-- bath water.

00:22:52,695 --> 00:22:54,597
And the blow to the
back of the head

00:22:54,663 --> 00:22:55,831
consistent
with a fall.

00:22:55,898 --> 00:22:57,233
Besides, Homicide
reported

00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:59,802
that nothing at the scene
indicated foul play,

00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:01,670
so, there was no
reason to do more

00:23:01,737 --> 00:23:03,539
than an abbreviated autopsy.

00:23:03,606 --> 00:23:05,207
No one's impugning
your work, Doctor.

00:23:05,274 --> 00:23:06,709
Yeah, it's nothing personal,
Doc.

00:23:06,775 --> 00:23:08,544
Well, this <i>is</i> personal, Nick.

00:23:08,611 --> 00:23:10,546
I tend to take
my work to heart,

00:23:10,613 --> 00:23:12,815
and when the two of you
come in here

00:23:12,882 --> 00:23:15,417
asking me to sign
a court-ordered request

00:23:15,484 --> 00:23:19,054
for an exhumation of a body
that's already left my hands,

00:23:19,121 --> 00:23:21,223
I tend to take it
very personally.

00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,858
Look, I'm the one
who said

00:23:22,925 --> 00:23:25,294
Shelley Stark's death
was an accident,

00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:27,363
and I'm the one
with second thoughts.

00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:29,131
I mean, it's my ass
on the line.

00:23:29,198 --> 00:23:31,534
That's wrong, Captain.
It's my ass on the line.

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,636
I don't think the two of you
are sensitive

00:23:33,702 --> 00:23:35,671
to what we're
really talking about here.

00:23:35,738 --> 00:23:38,073
First of all, exhumations
are costly and public.

00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,976
Makes this office look inept,
and that's just internally.

00:23:41,043 --> 00:23:42,645
God forbid it gets
in the newspaper.

00:23:42,711 --> 00:23:43,913
Remember something--

00:23:43,979 --> 00:23:47,349
the public does not understand
abbreviated autopsy.

00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:50,085
All they hear
is "Oh, what did he miss?"

00:23:50,152 --> 00:23:51,787
No one's saying
you missed anything.

00:23:51,854 --> 00:23:52,788
We have new evidence.

00:23:52,855 --> 00:23:54,323
We need to reevaluate the body.

00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,559
Respectfully, Nick,
I don't think you understand.

00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,794
I think I do understand.

00:23:58,861 --> 00:24:00,529
Yeah, Nick...

00:24:00,596 --> 00:24:01,964
Give us a minute,
will you?

00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:03,365
Just a minute.

00:24:05,734 --> 00:24:07,403
Neither of us want to be wrong,

00:24:07,469 --> 00:24:09,538
but this isn't about
the press, the public,

00:24:09,605 --> 00:24:10,706
your office,
you or me.

00:24:10,773 --> 00:24:12,107
This is about Shelley Stark.

00:24:12,174 --> 00:24:13,742
Now, we can do
one of two things.

00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:15,611
We can do nothing,
let this guy walk,

00:24:15,678 --> 00:24:18,314
or we can go to work,
exhume the body,

00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,882
and find
new evidence.

00:24:19,949 --> 00:24:21,884
Now, it's your call.

00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:12,593
The poison
in both bottles

00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,416
is naratriptamine.

00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:15,952
Same trace impurities
in the water-- sulfides,

00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:18,622
phenols, amino acid complexes
and caffeine.

00:25:18,688 --> 00:25:21,057
So, we've got two bottles
of poisoned Innoko water--

00:25:21,124 --> 00:25:22,626
one from a comedy club
on Western,

00:25:22,692 --> 00:25:24,227
the other
from a convenience store

00:25:24,294 --> 00:25:25,362
halfway across town.

00:25:25,428 --> 00:25:26,930
What's the connection?

00:25:26,997 --> 00:25:28,798
There may not be one;
it could just be random.

00:25:28,865 --> 00:25:30,400
So, how are we going
to get this guy?

00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:31,835
You know, they never
caught the guy

00:25:31,901 --> 00:25:34,037
who put the cyanide in the
Tylenol back in the '80s.

00:25:34,104 --> 00:25:35,238
They found out

00:25:35,305 --> 00:25:36,740
how the bottles
were tampered with.

00:25:36,806 --> 00:25:38,441
That's where safety seals
came from.

00:26:00,597 --> 00:26:05,168
No injection holes
in the bottle from
the Speedy Mart.

00:26:05,235 --> 00:26:07,437
Do you see anything?

00:26:07,504 --> 00:26:09,973
No, nothing yet.

00:26:12,876 --> 00:26:15,312
Wait a minute.

00:26:15,378 --> 00:26:17,547
It's in the threads.

00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,790
Would you like to try
one from the Comedy Hole?

00:26:26,856 --> 00:26:29,225
Mr. Phillips,
she's not going to hop out

00:26:29,292 --> 00:26:30,827
of that coffin by herself.

00:26:30,894 --> 00:26:33,229
Doc, I'm not quite sure
how to proceed.

00:26:33,296 --> 00:26:34,965
First exhumation.

00:26:35,031 --> 00:26:36,933
Well, it's very simple.

00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,802
You open it up.

00:26:38,868 --> 00:26:40,437
Now, if she grabs you,

00:26:40,503 --> 00:26:43,640
use your free hand
and hold her down, okay?

00:26:43,707 --> 00:26:46,009
Okay.

00:26:46,076 --> 00:26:48,311
( <i>lid squeaking</i> )

00:26:52,115 --> 00:26:53,516
Wow.

00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:55,485
She's pretty well-preserved.

00:26:55,552 --> 00:26:57,487
NICK:
Well, embalming does...

00:26:57,554 --> 00:27:00,090
Removes the blood,
retards bacterial growth,

00:27:00,156 --> 00:27:02,292
and, uh, pickles the tissue.

00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,760
David, would you
go to the store

00:27:03,827 --> 00:27:04,861
and buy some
cold cream?

00:27:04,928 --> 00:27:06,696
Why?
Her makeup--

00:27:06,763 --> 00:27:07,864
it's got to come off.

00:27:07,931 --> 00:27:09,666
Oh. Okay.

00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:11,067
Thanks.

00:27:11,134 --> 00:27:13,670
Thanks, Dave.

00:27:13,737 --> 00:27:16,973
Las Vegas awakens today
with a terrible realization

00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,043
that our city may face
a new and deadly menace.

00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,513
15-year-old Casey Flynn
collapsed and died this morning

00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,516
shortly after drinking a bottle
of Innoko water

00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:29,119
at a convenience store
near Torrey Pines.

00:27:29,185 --> 00:27:31,888
What kind of sick bastard
would do something like this?

00:27:31,955 --> 00:27:34,291
The question isn't
who-- it's how.

00:27:34,357 --> 00:27:36,393
As in how do they
expect this lab

00:27:36,459 --> 00:27:40,063
to test 40,000 bottles
of overpriced tap water?

00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,432
If we have to, one
bottle at a time

00:27:42,499 --> 00:27:44,834
until we find every
tainted bottle.

00:27:44,901 --> 00:27:47,137
The events occurred
on opposite ends of town,

00:27:47,203 --> 00:27:48,972
and investigators
have not yet established

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,475
a definite connection
between the two deaths.

00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:55,145
But Las Vegas residents
fear the worst--

00:27:55,211 --> 00:27:57,347
that our city may be in the grip

00:27:57,414 --> 00:27:59,549
of a product-tampering
nightmare.

00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,785
You know
how they tested for the cyanide

00:28:01,851 --> 00:28:02,919
in the Tylenol case?

00:28:02,986 --> 00:28:04,321
Hodges? One, two, three?

00:28:04,387 --> 00:28:05,522
( <i>imitates buzzer</i> )

00:28:05,588 --> 00:28:07,324
They took it to the airport.

00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:10,660
They x-rayed bottles in bulk
using baggage scanners.

00:28:10,727 --> 00:28:13,096
Nice-- cyanide's opaque
to X rays.

00:28:13,163 --> 00:28:14,998
Yeah, cyanide and X rays--

00:28:15,065 --> 00:28:16,566
that's a lucky break.

00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:17,901
But any of you geniuses

00:28:17,968 --> 00:28:20,170
have a "lucky" test
for naratriptamine?

00:28:20,236 --> 00:28:23,006
We've got a bigger problem
than we thought we had.

00:28:23,073 --> 00:28:24,574
Why are you looking at me?

00:28:24,641 --> 00:28:26,042
I'm not looking at you.

00:28:26,109 --> 00:28:27,143
Yes, you are.

00:28:28,778 --> 00:28:31,014
We think that we nailed
the tampering method.

00:28:31,081 --> 00:28:32,849
The poison
wasn't inside the bottle.

00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:34,184
It was on the bottle cap.

00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,619
We think that the killer

00:28:35,685 --> 00:28:37,320
dripped a solution
of naratriptamine

00:28:37,387 --> 00:28:38,421
into the threads

00:28:38,488 --> 00:28:39,823
<i>of the bottle cap.</i>

00:28:39,889 --> 00:28:42,759
<i>Capillary action pulled</i>
<i>the solution into the threads,</i>

00:28:42,826 --> 00:28:44,594
where it dried
into white crystals.

00:28:44,661 --> 00:28:47,063
Oh, so, each time Dougie Max
and Casey Flynn took a sip,

00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,032
the liquid came in contact
with the threads

00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:50,533
and washed back
into the bottle.

00:28:52,836 --> 00:28:53,903
And so the
poison I found

00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,605
in the Innoko water
was... backwash.

00:28:55,672 --> 00:28:57,507
Which means that
we're going to have

00:28:57,574 --> 00:28:58,642
to take the caps off

00:28:58,708 --> 00:29:00,443
of 40,000 bottles.

00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,811
Right now,
that's the way it looks.

00:29:01,878 --> 00:29:03,213
Great.

00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:34,344
I need to see the lot numbers

00:29:34,411 --> 00:29:36,680
of the bottles you pulled
from the convenience store.

00:29:36,746 --> 00:29:40,483
I got all the stacks arranged
by locations,

00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:44,020
so the convenience store
is right here.

00:29:44,087 --> 00:29:48,558
140 bottles-- NV6630.

00:29:51,094 --> 00:29:53,430
The tainted bottles
didn't come from this lot.

00:29:53,496 --> 00:29:56,666
Well, the bottle that
killed Casey Flynn
came from this store.

00:29:56,733 --> 00:29:59,769
Somebody may have just walked in
and put it there, though.

00:29:59,836 --> 00:30:02,038
Where are the bottles
from the comedy club?

00:30:02,105 --> 00:30:04,207
Over here.

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,847
These are a match.

00:30:10,914 --> 00:30:14,684
So, the source of
the poison bottles
was the comedy club.

00:30:14,751 --> 00:30:17,053
Maybe the killer
wanted us to think

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,255
it was random product tampering.

00:30:19,322 --> 00:30:21,091
Why?

00:30:21,157 --> 00:30:23,750
To cover up one murder
with another.

00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:31,810
I've never seen
mold like this.

00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:33,979
Embalming fluid's a witch's brew

00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:36,982
of formaldehyde, phenol,
menthol and alcohol,

00:30:37,048 --> 00:30:40,218
perfume and pink coloring agent.

00:30:40,285 --> 00:30:42,954
Kills the bacteria,
but mold feeds on it?

00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:43,989
Yeah.

00:30:44,055 --> 00:30:47,159
It's like
bathing an infant, Nick.

00:30:47,225 --> 00:30:49,828
Soft and always
in motion.

00:30:54,366 --> 00:30:56,301
What's wrong?
I'm not doing it right?

00:30:56,368 --> 00:30:57,502
No, you're
doing fine.

00:30:57,569 --> 00:30:59,471
See the bruising

00:30:59,538 --> 00:31:01,873
on her back and
her right elbow?

00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,242
It's consistent with her fall.

00:31:04,309 --> 00:31:06,044
But it wasn't in your report.

00:31:06,111 --> 00:31:09,381
Well, it wasn't evident
four weeks ago.

00:31:09,447 --> 00:31:10,982
Subtle bruising
may not be evident

00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:12,284
<i>at the time of death,</i>

00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,653
<i>but it can be accentuated</i>
<i>by the embalming process</i>

00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:17,155
<i>after the body leaves my slab.</i>

00:31:17,222 --> 00:31:21,526
<i>This bruising would have meant</i>
<i>nothing to the mortician.</i>

00:31:21,593 --> 00:31:24,095
They're in the beauty business.

00:31:24,162 --> 00:31:26,932
It's my job to spot them,
his job to cover them.

00:31:26,998 --> 00:31:28,433
Let's turn her over.

00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,434
Got her?

00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:30,435
Yeah.

00:31:30,502 --> 00:31:31,670
Here we go.

00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:39,344
All right, let's see
what's under that makeup.

00:31:48,487 --> 00:31:51,223
Bruises on her face.

00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:55,894
Brass was right.

00:31:55,961 --> 00:31:58,597
We are looking
at murder.

00:31:58,663 --> 00:32:00,165
Naratriptamine
comes in tablet form.

00:32:00,232 --> 00:32:01,666
In order to get it
in the solution,

00:32:01,733 --> 00:32:02,901
you'd have to grind it up.

00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:05,770
There were traces of caffeine
with the naratriptamine.

00:32:05,837 --> 00:32:07,439
Right, so how
did it get there?

00:32:07,506 --> 00:32:09,608
Maybe it got there
during the grinding process.

00:32:09,674 --> 00:32:11,877
There was a coffee grinder
in the Green Room

00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:13,912
at the Comedy Hole.

00:32:16,648 --> 00:32:18,817
Do you provide your
comedians with coffee

00:32:18,884 --> 00:32:20,252
or do they brew
their own?

00:32:20,318 --> 00:32:21,720
Around here you get generic.

00:32:21,786 --> 00:32:24,556
If they want something special,
they can bring a thermos.

00:32:24,623 --> 00:32:27,592
Just take
whatever you want, okay?

00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:29,828
Knock yourself out.

00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,918
That's the last
picture taken

00:32:49,985 --> 00:32:54,322
of Dougie Max
before he died.

00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:02,297
Doesn't the red light
mean "get off the stage"?

00:33:02,364 --> 00:33:05,066
No, the red light means
"get off the stage <i>now."</i>

00:33:05,133 --> 00:33:08,036
So why were you giving
Dougie Max the red light?

00:33:08,103 --> 00:33:09,504
He's my headliner.

00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,706
I wasn't giving him
the red light.

00:33:43,171 --> 00:33:47,175
We're going to need
a sample of everyone's DNA.

00:33:47,242 --> 00:33:48,610
All right, gentleman.

00:33:48,677 --> 00:33:49,611
Good afternoon.

00:33:49,678 --> 00:33:51,179
Could you line up
for me, please.

00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:52,247
Right up here,
please.

00:33:52,314 --> 00:33:54,082
Is this going
to take a long time?

00:33:54,149 --> 00:33:57,052
I've got a 4:00 bikini wax
that I don't want to miss.

00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:59,521
I got to get my wig redone
like in a half hour, so if we...

00:33:59,588 --> 00:34:00,922
I have plenty of time.

00:34:00,989 --> 00:34:02,290
I have no career.

00:34:02,357 --> 00:34:03,725
Right, well, I can see

00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:06,795
you all know how to open
your mouths, so, good.

00:34:06,862 --> 00:34:08,330
Ready?

00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:12,868
Just give me an "O."

00:34:12,934 --> 00:34:14,970
I need a lot of foreplay.

00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:17,139
Oh, well, then maybe I
should use a rectal swab.

00:34:17,205 --> 00:34:19,040
Ah... oh.

00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,010
Good boy.

00:34:22,077 --> 00:34:23,979
Okay, who's next
for some foreplay?

00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:26,348
Oh, a nail
biter, huh?

00:34:26,414 --> 00:34:28,717
You mind if I see your hands?

00:34:36,224 --> 00:34:37,559
I'm one of 11 kids

00:34:37,626 --> 00:34:38,693
from 12 dads.

00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,028
You figure it out.

00:34:40,095 --> 00:34:41,163
<i>Yeah, I gave him the red light.</i>

00:34:41,229 --> 00:34:42,531
What are you going to do,

00:34:42,597 --> 00:34:45,367
arrest me for distraction
with intent to humiliate?

00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:46,935
I'm guilty.

00:34:49,137 --> 00:34:50,138
What?
Are you kidding me?

00:34:50,205 --> 00:34:52,474
I was joking.

00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:54,676
Funny.

00:34:54,743 --> 00:34:56,878
BRASS:
You know, something
about your wife's case

00:34:56,945 --> 00:34:57,979
never felt right to me.

00:34:58,046 --> 00:35:00,248
It bugged me,
kept me up at night.

00:35:00,315 --> 00:35:02,884
It's not because you called
your insurance company

00:35:02,951 --> 00:35:04,419
and filed a claim
the next day.

00:35:04,486 --> 00:35:06,221
It's your policy;
it's your right.

00:35:06,288 --> 00:35:08,123
It's not because you
bought a new Ferrari;

00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,524
it's your money.

00:35:09,591 --> 00:35:11,359
Or because you're
with a beautiful girl.

00:35:11,426 --> 00:35:12,861
I mean, you just
lost your wife,

00:35:12,928 --> 00:35:14,196
you need some companionship.

00:35:14,262 --> 00:35:16,932
No.

00:35:16,998 --> 00:35:20,035
Because of something you said.

00:35:20,101 --> 00:35:22,537
What am I going to do?

00:35:22,604 --> 00:35:25,340
She was my life.

00:35:25,407 --> 00:35:29,978
You said, "She <i>was</i> my life."

00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:31,546
Not <i>is.</i>

00:35:31,613 --> 00:35:32,948
That's why I'm sitting here?

00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:36,051
Because I used the wrong tense
at the time of my wife's death?

00:35:36,118 --> 00:35:37,552
No, hold on
a minute.

00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:39,921
I've been a detective
for half my life.

00:35:39,988 --> 00:35:43,291
I can count on one hand
the times surviving spouses

00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:46,728
used the past tense,
and I got to tell you,

00:35:46,795 --> 00:35:51,233
I'll be damned if every one of
them wasn't guilty of something.

00:35:53,835 --> 00:35:55,537
Now, I mean, that's just me.

00:35:55,604 --> 00:35:58,206
I mean, in a court of law
it means nothing.

00:35:58,273 --> 00:35:59,975
NICK:
But...

00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:02,544
this...

00:36:02,611 --> 00:36:04,946
and this...

00:36:05,013 --> 00:36:07,115
and this...

00:36:07,182 --> 00:36:08,650
mean everything.

00:36:08,717 --> 00:36:10,285
The fact that
you're left-handed

00:36:10,352 --> 00:36:11,853
doesn't hurt us either.

00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,455
Hurts you, though.

00:36:13,522 --> 00:36:15,423
Wait a minute.

00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,925
I haven't
seen these.

00:36:16,992 --> 00:36:18,527
New evidence.

00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,729
Body was exhumed
by a court order.

00:36:20,796 --> 00:36:23,064
Second autopsy.

00:36:23,131 --> 00:36:24,166
You dug her up?

00:36:24,232 --> 00:36:25,433
Mm-hmm.

00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,637
I didn't give anyone
permission to dig her up.

00:36:28,703 --> 00:36:30,205
You're a suspect
in a murder case.

00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:31,673
We don't need your permission.

00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,974
Can they do that?

00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:35,644
Yeah.

00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,880
You killed your wife, George.

00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:41,183
I loved my wife.

00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:43,218
And she loved you.

00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:45,587
Which is why she didn't react

00:36:45,654 --> 00:36:49,090
when you walked into
the bathroom that night.

00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:23,358
You staged the crime scene.

00:37:23,425 --> 00:37:25,727
You see, it's physically
impossible for her

00:37:25,794 --> 00:37:28,296
to pull that towel rack
off the bathroom wall.

00:37:28,363 --> 00:37:30,432
It was an accident.

00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:32,901
You said so yourself.

00:37:32,968 --> 00:37:35,237
I was wrong.

00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:43,145
I see the pictures.
I hear the theories.

00:37:43,211 --> 00:37:46,047
Still doesn't make
my client a murderer.

00:37:51,153 --> 00:37:53,889
( <i>indistinct muttering</i> )

00:37:55,657 --> 00:37:56,558
Hey!

00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:58,727
Hey! Hey!

00:37:58,794 --> 00:38:00,729
That's my car!
What are you...?

00:38:03,899 --> 00:38:04,866
What the hell is going on?

00:38:04,933 --> 00:38:05,867
This is harassment.

00:38:05,934 --> 00:38:07,702
We don't have enough
to file charges,

00:38:07,769 --> 00:38:09,905
but the insurance
company

00:38:09,971 --> 00:38:11,740
feels they got
more than enough.

00:38:11,807 --> 00:38:13,041
Civil charges.

00:38:13,108 --> 00:38:15,977
Translated: that means they
want their cheese back, man.

00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,112
They want their $750K.

00:38:17,179 --> 00:38:19,214
They can just take my car?

00:38:19,281 --> 00:38:20,382
For starters, yeah.

00:38:20,449 --> 00:38:22,083
This isn't the end of our

00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:24,019
criminal investigation
there, George.

00:38:24,085 --> 00:38:25,787
It's just the beginning.

00:38:25,854 --> 00:38:28,590
That's present tense.

00:38:28,657 --> 00:38:30,158
The coffee you bagged
from the club

00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:31,960
doesn't match
the tainted Innoko water.

00:38:32,027 --> 00:38:33,428
That's the bad news.

00:38:33,495 --> 00:38:35,130
Still listening.

00:38:35,197 --> 00:38:38,433
You know what I have that
you want in the mornings?

00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,536
Apart from my devilish grin and
rakish good looks, of course.

00:38:41,603 --> 00:38:42,938
I like your coffee.

00:38:43,004 --> 00:38:44,039
No, no.

00:38:44,105 --> 00:38:45,106
You love my coffee.

00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:46,174
And you want to know why?

00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:47,242
It's Blue Hawaiian.

00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:49,311
40 bucks a pound,
hand-picked...

00:38:49,377 --> 00:38:51,446
I know,
the finest money can buy.

00:38:51,513 --> 00:38:53,081
No, not even close.

00:38:53,148 --> 00:38:54,216
Just let me get there.

00:38:54,282 --> 00:38:56,284
Now caffeine by itself
is not distinctive.

00:38:56,351 --> 00:38:58,320
It's in all kinds
of coffee by definition.

00:38:58,386 --> 00:39:01,289
Now the trace amino acid
complex, on the other hand,

00:39:01,356 --> 00:39:02,624
is a signature.

00:39:02,691 --> 00:39:06,027
Okay, so you've identified
the type of coffee.

00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,164
Kopi Luwak.

00:39:09,231 --> 00:39:11,700
The most expensive
coffee in the world.

00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,302
Revered for its rich,
chocolatey texture

00:39:14,369 --> 00:39:16,404
and made from the excrement

00:39:16,471 --> 00:39:18,440
of a small Indonesian
cat-like creature

00:39:18,507 --> 00:39:19,841
known as a luwak.

00:39:19,908 --> 00:39:21,576
Cat feces?

00:39:21,643 --> 00:39:23,678
The luwak eats
only the ripest beans,

00:39:23,745 --> 00:39:26,481
which pass through
its digestive system intact.

00:39:26,548 --> 00:39:28,083
However, during the process

00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,152
enzymes break down
a number of amino acids

00:39:30,218 --> 00:39:31,286
which cause
bitterness.

00:39:31,353 --> 00:39:33,755
And leaves
a unique chemical signature.

00:39:33,822 --> 00:39:35,824
So whichever one
of your suspects

00:39:35,891 --> 00:39:38,059
drinks Kopi Luwak
is your killer.

00:39:41,196 --> 00:39:43,865
We are a bashing nation.

00:39:43,932 --> 00:39:45,534
Gay bashing?
You know what that is?

00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,635
That's guys going,

00:39:46,701 --> 00:39:50,472
"I hate you 'cause
you're queer and you're gay

00:39:50,539 --> 00:39:53,308
"and you're kind
of attractive

00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:56,111
"and I would like to have sex
with you but I'm in the closet

00:39:56,178 --> 00:39:58,113
"so I'll just
beat you up

00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,481
"and then play with myself

00:39:59,548 --> 00:40:02,150
in my Trans Am
on the way home."

00:40:02,217 --> 00:40:03,452
Boo.

00:40:03,518 --> 00:40:04,486
Boo?

00:40:04,553 --> 00:40:05,821
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:40:05,887 --> 00:40:07,289
I didn't mean to offend you.

00:40:07,355 --> 00:40:08,490
Hey, you know what?

00:40:08,557 --> 00:40:09,691
If that offends you,

00:40:09,758 --> 00:40:11,560
perhaps you should
just come out of the closet

00:40:11,626 --> 00:40:12,694
and move on with your life.

00:40:12,761 --> 00:40:14,129
You're going to feel
so much better.

00:40:14,196 --> 00:40:15,597
You know, you are what you hate.

00:40:21,803 --> 00:40:23,805
All right, um...

00:40:23,872 --> 00:40:26,708
Mm, I'm a little dehydrated.

00:40:26,775 --> 00:40:29,611
I hope you don't mind
if I replenish my bodily fluids.

00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:30,779
Mm...

00:40:32,714 --> 00:40:35,917
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:40:35,984 --> 00:40:38,553
( <i>applause</i> )

00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:41,990
It's a cruel world...

00:40:42,057 --> 00:40:44,025
CROWD:
Ain't it great?

00:40:44,092 --> 00:40:45,093
Yeah.

00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,361
You know what you'd like?

00:40:46,428 --> 00:40:48,396
How many people
would like it if I just,

00:40:48,463 --> 00:40:49,998
if I just
dropped trou right now

00:40:50,065 --> 00:40:53,768
and pee on
Vin Diesel's head, huh?

00:40:53,835 --> 00:40:55,237
( <i>cheering</i> )

00:40:55,303 --> 00:40:57,506
I'm going to do it
for you good people.

00:40:57,572 --> 00:40:59,774
I'll do it.

00:41:02,444 --> 00:41:05,514
( <i>cheering</i> )

00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,149
Open wide.

00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,251
I'm flattering myself,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:41:09,317 --> 00:41:11,019
You don't have to open up
that wide.

00:41:11,086 --> 00:41:14,422
See, I'm implying
I have a tiny, tiny penis.

00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:16,358
That's what that joke would be.

00:41:16,424 --> 00:41:17,759
Ergo, the comedy.

00:41:17,826 --> 00:41:20,962
I'm talking about penises.

00:41:21,029 --> 00:41:23,999
You just want to eat
out of that toilet bowl.

00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,801
Yum, yum.

00:41:25,867 --> 00:41:28,170
( <i>cheering</i> )

00:41:30,806 --> 00:41:31,773
Shut up.

00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,642
( <i>cheering</i> )

00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:35,277
Shut up.

00:41:35,343 --> 00:41:36,211
Don't you get it?

00:41:36,278 --> 00:41:37,612
Are you that stupid?

00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:39,247
I am making fun of you.

00:41:39,314 --> 00:41:41,249
I am the lowest
common denominator

00:41:41,316 --> 00:41:43,351
in comedy when I do that crap.

00:41:46,988 --> 00:41:52,060
The only way I could get you
to stop laughing now

00:41:52,127 --> 00:41:55,630
is if I went
to every single table

00:41:55,697 --> 00:41:58,166
and slit every one
of your throats.

00:42:02,804 --> 00:42:04,339
I can see that
I am getting

00:42:04,406 --> 00:42:06,341
the red light,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:42:06,408 --> 00:42:09,311
and that means
it's time for me to stop.

00:42:09,377 --> 00:42:14,716
Stop with the hate
and stop with the fear.

00:42:14,783 --> 00:42:17,619
Stop with the lies.

00:42:17,686 --> 00:42:19,988
Comedy, uh,

00:42:20,055 --> 00:42:23,592
comedy's supposed
to be about the truth.

00:42:23,658 --> 00:42:27,562
You know, uh, I killed tonight.

00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:32,601
And, uh, I killed, uh,
two nights ago.

00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:34,836
Dougie Max.

00:42:34,903 --> 00:42:37,339
Uh... on this stage.

00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:44,946
'Cause I despised
everything he stood for.

00:42:45,013 --> 00:42:48,483
Dumb people, like you.

00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:52,220
You think I did a disservice
to the world

00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,189
by killing
Dougie Max?

00:42:54,256 --> 00:42:58,560
You ought to give me a parade.

00:42:58,627 --> 00:43:00,562
But the shame of it is,

00:43:00,629 --> 00:43:04,332
is that, uh, an innocent kid

00:43:04,399 --> 00:43:07,068
got killed, too,
and, uh...

00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,304
I blame you.

00:43:09,371 --> 00:43:12,874
Yeah, I, uh...

00:43:12,941 --> 00:43:16,745
I didn't think you were
going to get the joke.

00:43:16,812 --> 00:43:19,381
Oh, I got it.

00:43:19,448 --> 00:43:21,229
It just wasn't funny.
