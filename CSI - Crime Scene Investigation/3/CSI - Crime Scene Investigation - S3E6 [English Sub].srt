( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:02:14,643 --> 00:02:17,079
Grissom... a stay.

00:02:17,146 --> 00:02:20,983
New evidence appeal:
hair analysis.

00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,751
I already overnighted
the six pubic hairs

00:02:22,818 --> 00:02:24,119
found on the victim
to Norfolk--

00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:27,022
Department of Criminal Justice--
for mitochondrial DNA analysis.

00:02:36,098 --> 00:02:39,168
Defense thinks DNA's
a magic pill for exoneration.

00:02:39,234 --> 00:02:41,770
I doubt if it's going to change
the outcome.

00:02:43,672 --> 00:02:45,007
You don't know
what I'm talking about.

00:02:45,074 --> 00:02:47,109
Not really.

00:02:47,176 --> 00:02:49,545
<i>People v. John Mathers.</i>

00:02:49,611 --> 00:02:51,747
Serial. Western LVU.
I was a rookie...

00:02:51,814 --> 00:02:53,415
Three dead coeds?

00:02:53,482 --> 00:02:56,085
All sexually assaulted,
but no semen was found.

00:02:56,151 --> 00:02:57,686
Suspected he wore a condom.

00:02:57,753 --> 00:02:58,954
Dumped in garbage bags.

00:02:59,021 --> 00:03:00,823
Case with the
strongest evidence

00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,291
was victim number three:

00:03:02,358 --> 00:03:03,292
Charlene Roth.

00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:05,294
Mathers, a campus
security guard

00:03:05,361 --> 00:03:06,895
got murder one for that.

00:03:06,962 --> 00:03:08,364
When are you going
to get the test back?

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,466
I put a rush on it.

00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:14,136
Is this your first one?

00:03:14,203 --> 00:03:16,472
First to exhaust
all of his appeals

00:03:16,538 --> 00:03:18,307
and get an execution date.

00:03:20,142 --> 00:03:21,910
How many have you had?

00:03:21,977 --> 00:03:23,312
Two.

00:03:25,014 --> 00:03:27,082
So, how do you
feel about it?

00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:31,086
Mathers was convicted
and sent to death row

00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:32,388
by a jury of his peers.

00:03:32,454 --> 00:03:33,722
I played a small part.

00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:35,157
I presented my findings...

00:03:35,224 --> 00:03:36,358
Non-responsive.

00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,062
Okay.

00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:42,698
I haven't figured
out how I feel yet.

00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:44,500
It's just about evidence.

00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:47,102
It's not up to you
whether he lives or dies.

00:03:48,737 --> 00:03:50,250

A girl, 17,
didn't show up for work

and they found
Dad passed out
on the sofa

in a blood-soaked
T-shirt.


00:04:46,903 --> 00:04:49,305
Did he have anything to

Mr. Reston, uh,
can't remember what day it is.

00:04:55,678 --> 00:04:57,747
His blood alcohol level is .37.


00:04:57,814 --> 00:05:00,883
Ooh... alcoholic.


00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,418
Yeah.


00:05:02,485 --> 00:05:04,420
Lucky me.


00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:08,357
( <i>loudly</i> ):
Hey, buddy, this is Sara Sidle
of the Las Vegas Crime Lab.


00:05:08,424 --> 00:05:10,526
She's going to ask you
some questions.


00:05:10,593 --> 00:05:14,730
Sir, I need your shirt
and I need to see your hands.


00:05:14,797 --> 00:05:16,132
Shirt and hands!

00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,611
Hey.


00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:30,079
Hey.


00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,216
People are pigs.


00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:35,251
Don't insult
the pigs, Nick.


00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:37,386
They're actually
very clean.


00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:44,827
Must be the girl's room.


00:05:45,962 --> 00:05:48,965
Doesn't seem like
the same house.


00:05:53,035 --> 00:05:55,505
Dead bolts on her bedroom door.


00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:57,440
Trying to keep
something out.


00:05:57,507 --> 00:05:58,775
Hmm.


00:06:06,582 --> 00:06:08,718
A bedroom refrigerator?


00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:16,559
There's milk, fruit...
a toaster?


00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,028
Guess they weren't much
on family dinners.

( <i>camera clicking</i> )


00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:28,671
Nick?


00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,475
A gi and a black belt.


00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:36,012

I'll bag it.

00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,839
BROWN:
I heard Mathers
had that I.V. in his arm

00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:38,841
and everything,
when that call came in.

00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:44,180
Never had a death penalty case
get that far.

00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:45,248
Just working it all out?

00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:48,518
Yeah. Old case, new eyes,
new technology.

00:07:48,584 --> 00:07:50,953
This evidence was processed,
what, 15 years ago?

00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,021
That was before DNA.

00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:53,656
Now that the case
has been reopened

00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,324
I can re-evaluate
all three murders.

00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,794
We always thought Mathers
was good for the other two

00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,629
but if they overturn
Charlene Roth with
the new DNA

00:07:59,695 --> 00:08:02,765
we can go back and try Mathers
with the other two murders

00:08:02,832 --> 00:08:04,000
with the new evidence.

00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,836
Keep Mathers in prison.

00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,208
You pro or con?

00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:14,477
Pro, if he did it.

00:08:14,544 --> 00:08:15,745
The applications sucks, though.

00:08:15,812 --> 00:08:17,380
There's a lot of brown skin
on that row.

00:08:17,447 --> 00:08:18,848
Yeah.

00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,683
What about you?

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,819
I try not to give it
much thought.

00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:24,720
I stick to the work.
Really?

00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:26,189
Campus police

00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,192
found the victim
Charlene Roth in
this trash bag.

00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,493
The trash bag, yeah.

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,694
I was looking at that.

00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,996
Processed with superglue,
rhodamine, laser.

00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:36,566
No prints found though.

00:08:36,632 --> 00:08:38,501
Who's working
the print lab tonight?

00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:40,770
Franco. Just off of days.

00:08:43,473 --> 00:08:45,341
Hey, I hear you're
cheating on me

00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:47,343
with an out-of-state
DNA analyst.

00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,011
Apples and oranges, Greg.

00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:50,613
15-year-old hair samples

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,949
no roots, room-
temperature storage.

00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:54,050
Room temp?

00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,786
Yeah, that's how we
stored hair evidence
back then.

00:08:56,853 --> 00:08:57,920
Microscopy was king.

00:08:57,987 --> 00:08:59,555
Really? I thought
Elvis was king.

00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,690
And you are how old?

00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:02,825
Age is irrelevant
in our relationship.

00:09:02,892 --> 00:09:04,127
Maybe so, but
face it, Greg

00:09:04,193 --> 00:09:05,828
you just don't
have the equipment.

00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:08,431
The government results
won't give you an
individual profile

00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:10,066
and you can't put
them through CODIS.

00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,868
Well, maternal lineage

00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:13,336
is good enough on this one.

00:09:13,402 --> 00:09:16,038
No one else on Mathers'
mother's side is a suspect.

00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:18,107
So, if it's a match,
the stay is lifted

00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:19,475
he's back in the chamber.

00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:21,010
If not, we're back in court.

I'm so glad
you're back on nights.

00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:34,891
Got a good one for you.

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,729
Trash bag?
Yeah, love it.

00:09:39,796 --> 00:09:41,397
Give it some
vacuum metal deposition.

Hottest thing going for plastic.

If there's anything to be found,
my machine'll find it.

00:09:45,435 --> 00:09:46,402
And, um, super-rush.

to catch up.
How's Lindsey?

00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:56,012
Second grade, tons of homework.

00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:57,046
Lucky for her

00:09:57,113 --> 00:09:58,481
she got your smarts,
not Eddie's.

00:09:58,548 --> 00:10:00,183
Now I know why
I missed you so much.

00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:05,368
I was confident at trial.

00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:06,903
I'm still confident.

00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:08,337
The evidence is solid.

00:13:08,404 --> 00:13:10,440
If the court overturns
the conv...

00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:12,241
We just can't go through
another trial.

00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:13,676
( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:13:13,743 --> 00:13:17,113
Uh, well, you will have
an answer very soon.

00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,347
I'm sure of it.

00:13:18,414 --> 00:13:21,851
Excuse me. I need to go.

00:13:24,153 --> 00:13:26,489
What's going on?
I'm not on call.

00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,824
I know.
I called you

00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,826
because your name's
on the memo.

00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:30,860
Which memo?

00:13:30,927 --> 00:13:33,029
Young female, bound,
trash bag.

00:13:33,096 --> 00:13:34,597
Copycats come out
of the woodwork

00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:36,165
every time there's
an execution.

00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,001
Mather's attorney is going
to have a field day.

00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:42,071
Everybody liked Mathers
for the Kent and Reese cases

00:13:42,138 --> 00:13:44,841
but the DA wouldn't file
because he already had

00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,676
a slam dunk
with Charlene Roth.

00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,745
How many times
can you fry a guy?

00:13:49,812 --> 00:13:50,880
Right.

00:13:50,947 --> 00:13:53,316
Maintenance guy
thought it was trash.

00:13:53,382 --> 00:13:54,984
Picked it up,
ripped open.

00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:56,652
Body dump.

00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:58,321
Just like 15 years ago.

00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,277
( <i>buzzing</i> )

00:14:45,728 --> 00:14:47,096
PHILLIPS:
You ready for me?

00:14:47,163 --> 00:14:48,264
Not yet.

00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:50,867
May I?

00:14:50,934 --> 00:14:52,302
Sure.

00:14:56,372 --> 00:14:58,141
What do you think this is?

00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,642
That's Grissom's bailiwick,
not mine.

00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:02,378
That's what I was thinking--
bug.

00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:03,379
What you got?

00:15:03,446 --> 00:15:04,380
Two-fer.

00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,616
Looks like some kind
of a bug casing

00:15:06,683 --> 00:15:08,718
and black fibers.

00:15:08,785 --> 00:15:11,721
She's all yours, David.

00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,063
How come I get you?

00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,898
Grissom says
it's precautionary

00:15:21,965 --> 00:15:23,733
in case Mathers
gets overturned

00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,968
and you get swamped.

00:15:25,034 --> 00:15:27,137
I'm glad to have
the help.

00:15:27,203 --> 00:15:29,139
This looks familiar.

00:15:29,205 --> 00:15:33,576
A little too familiar.

00:15:33,643 --> 00:15:35,211
Let's figure out
how she got here.

00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,065
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:07,410
( <i>beeping rapidly</i> )

00:16:10,013 --> 00:16:11,147
Hey, Griss...

00:16:12,148 --> 00:16:15,185
found a density change.

00:16:15,251 --> 00:16:16,486
The screen's showing something.

00:16:18,788 --> 00:16:21,291
What's your depth estimate?

00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:22,892
Two and a half feet.

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,862
Oh, dear.

00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:28,832
Shovels and screens,
chutes and ladders.

00:16:28,898 --> 00:16:30,266
Yeah.

00:16:44,214 --> 00:16:46,349
A little more.

00:16:46,749 --> 00:16:47,750
There we go.

00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,325
She's in rigor.

00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:56,526
At least 12 hours.

00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:05,435
Get out your ten card
and print her.

00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:07,403
But look out
for this blue paint.

00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,239
Catherine's going
to need to see it.

00:17:13,676 --> 00:17:17,213
Well, we got
something else
to hold Reston on:

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,649
Illegal burial
of a domestic animal.

00:17:19,716 --> 00:17:20,283
Weak.

00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,417
I'll cover him back up.

00:17:21,484 --> 00:17:23,286
So Debbie Reston

00:17:23,353 --> 00:17:24,721
never showed up at work

00:17:24,788 --> 00:17:27,023
and she's not buried
in the backyard.

00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,525
Where did Debbie go?

00:17:28,591 --> 00:17:30,760
I don't know her schedule.

00:17:30,827 --> 00:17:33,062
She works, goes to school.

00:17:33,129 --> 00:17:35,465
I hardly ever see her.

00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:38,768
GRISSOM:
She's 17.
She lives in your house.

00:17:38,835 --> 00:17:42,238
You're going
to have to do better than that.

00:17:42,305 --> 00:17:46,242
Stuck-up bitch is ashamed of me.

00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:50,346
Can't wait to graduate
high school and move out.

00:17:50,413 --> 00:17:52,449
She's already got
a job:

00:17:52,515 --> 00:17:54,918
coffee shop.

00:17:54,984 --> 00:17:56,019
Got a car.

00:17:56,085 --> 00:17:57,287
What kind of car?

00:17:57,353 --> 00:18:01,291
VW convertible, blue.

00:18:01,357 --> 00:18:04,994
And as a concerned parent,
you're going to ask me

00:18:05,061 --> 00:18:07,664
to put out a broadcast,
aren't you?

00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,265
Whatever.

00:18:09,332 --> 00:18:11,701
Is the car in her name
or yours?

00:18:11,768 --> 00:18:15,004
I'm going to need
the license plate number.

00:18:15,071 --> 00:18:17,106
You listening to me?

00:18:17,173 --> 00:18:19,008
I just left Greg in DNA.

00:18:19,075 --> 00:18:21,811
Blood on Reston's shirt
is his own.

00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:22,946
Blood on the towel?

00:18:23,012 --> 00:18:24,681
Eight markers match.
Family member.

00:18:24,747 --> 00:18:26,516
There's only two people
in the house.

00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,650
It's probably Debbie's

00:18:27,717 --> 00:18:29,919
but there isn't that much
blood on the towel.

00:18:29,986 --> 00:18:32,322
So what?
Innocuous injury?

00:18:32,388 --> 00:18:34,691
That's what
I'm thinking.

00:18:34,757 --> 00:18:37,026
You got kids?

00:18:37,093 --> 00:18:40,563
They think it's all about them.

00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,298
Like I owe her.

00:18:42,365 --> 00:18:45,201
You owe your daughter more
than being a drunk.

00:18:48,805 --> 00:18:49,939
You know, I think
that maybe jail

00:18:50,006 --> 00:18:51,541
might be the best thing
for you right now.

00:18:51,608 --> 00:18:55,245
I think she just took off...

00:18:55,311 --> 00:18:56,279
like her mother.

00:18:56,346 --> 00:18:58,548
Can you believe
this guy?

00:18:58,615 --> 00:19:00,617
I wouldn't blame
his kid

00:19:00,683 --> 00:19:02,585
if she just took off.

00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,189
Hey. Catherine and I
got a case

00:19:06,256 --> 00:19:08,324
at the university--
dead female.

00:19:08,391 --> 00:19:09,859
Prints just came back.

00:19:09,926 --> 00:19:13,296
Matches your
missing girl,
Debbie Reston.

00:19:13,363 --> 00:19:16,232
Brass just put a broadcast out
on her car.

00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:18,434
Then my guys
will find it.

00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:20,203
They're posting her now.

00:19:23,907 --> 00:19:26,142
ROBBINS:
Crazy world out there.

00:19:28,111 --> 00:19:30,280
Sorry I'm late.

00:19:30,346 --> 00:19:31,648
So, where are we?

00:19:31,714 --> 00:19:33,716
Debbie Reston, 17.

00:19:33,783 --> 00:19:36,653
She was taking a night class
at Western LVU.

00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:38,521
Prereq for early admission.

00:19:38,588 --> 00:19:41,057
So technically she was
a Western LVU student.

00:19:41,124 --> 00:19:43,226
Yep. Just like
Mathers' other victims.

00:19:43,293 --> 00:19:45,094
Thought Mathers
was on Death Row.

00:19:45,161 --> 00:19:47,297
Mm-hmm.

00:19:47,363 --> 00:19:48,598
Doc, you were here back then.

00:19:48,665 --> 00:19:50,099
Tell me why this one's
different.

00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,936
Suspect must be
intimately familiar

00:19:53,002 --> 00:19:55,238
with the minutiae
of the prior cases.

00:19:55,305 --> 00:19:57,207
What's identical:

00:19:57,273 --> 00:19:59,409
cause of death-- strangulation.

00:19:59,476 --> 00:20:01,778
Bruising on her wrists

00:20:01,845 --> 00:20:05,515
plastic zip tie,
navy-blue paint.

00:20:05,582 --> 00:20:10,720
There is one new element:
defensive wounds on the hands.

00:20:10,787 --> 00:20:14,257
Whatever she grabbed onto
shattered

00:20:14,324 --> 00:20:16,192
and caused these lacerations.

00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:19,462
Is that before or after
she got the paint on her hands?

00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:21,431
After.
One of these cuts

00:20:21,498 --> 00:20:24,868
sliced right through the paint.

00:20:24,934 --> 00:20:26,970
The paint was there first.

00:20:36,846 --> 00:20:38,648
It's still wet.

00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:40,884
So she's been dead
at least 12 hours, right?

00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,618
Right.

00:20:41,684 --> 00:20:43,787
What kind of paint

00:20:43,853 --> 00:20:47,323
doesn't dry in 12 hours,
I wonder.

00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,526
( <i>clock ticking</i> )

00:21:20,223 --> 00:21:22,258
( <i>whirring</i> )

00:21:23,993 --> 00:21:25,995
Ms. Willows.

00:21:26,062 --> 00:21:28,164
I heard you're investigating

00:21:28,231 --> 00:21:29,432
the murder at Western LVU.

00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:30,934
Female, young, bound

00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,836
dumped in a trash bag.

00:21:32,902 --> 00:21:34,537
( <i>clearing throat</i> )

00:21:34,604 --> 00:21:38,641
You know that I can't confirm
or deny any information

00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,010
regarding an active
investigation.

00:21:41,077 --> 00:21:42,145
Excuse me.

00:21:42,212 --> 00:21:44,514
Ms. Willows, my client's
life is on the line here.

00:21:44,581 --> 00:21:46,783
We've always maintained
John Mathers' innocence.

00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,552
Ms. Campbell, I have
no personal opinion
about your client.

00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:51,121
I tested the evidence
in his case

00:21:51,187 --> 00:21:53,123
and that evidence failed
to exonerate him.

00:21:53,189 --> 00:21:54,324
15 years ago.
Before DNA.

00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,126
Before the real killer
struck again.

00:21:56,192 --> 00:21:57,827
You are going to test
the pubic hair

00:21:57,894 --> 00:22:00,363
sent to the federal lab
against the new suspect...

00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,031
What suspect?

00:22:02,098 --> 00:22:03,299
I can't help you.

00:22:03,366 --> 00:22:06,436
You CSIs are biased
for the prosecution.

00:22:06,503 --> 00:22:08,171
You decide ahead
of time

00:22:08,238 --> 00:22:10,340
how you want the
evidence to come out.

00:22:10,406 --> 00:22:12,609
Ms. Campbell, I am only
an interpreter of the evidence.

00:22:12,675 --> 00:22:14,477
I know how to make
the evidence speak to me.

00:22:14,544 --> 00:22:15,845
I don't care about the outcome.

00:22:15,912 --> 00:22:18,014
How about guilt or innocence?

00:22:18,081 --> 00:22:20,583
John was 15 seconds
from execution.

00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,318
Sure you're not biased?

00:22:22,385 --> 00:22:24,087
I hear the same
evidence speaking.

00:22:24,154 --> 00:22:25,688
You know what
it's telling me.

00:22:25,755 --> 00:22:29,058
The killer's still out there.

00:22:32,896 --> 00:22:36,232
( <i>garbled radio transmission)</i>

00:22:44,474 --> 00:22:46,943
It's
Debbie Reston's car.

00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,345
Looks like you and I are
officially running

00:22:49,412 --> 00:22:50,346
with
the same case.

00:22:50,413 --> 00:22:51,815
Yeah?

00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:54,184
It's got to be the cleanest
tape lift I've ever seen.

00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,486
There's no stains
of any kind in this car.

00:22:56,553 --> 00:22:57,787
Whatever happened to her

00:22:57,854 --> 00:22:59,522
happened after she
left her car.

00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:01,691
Debbie Reston was taking
Economics 101.

00:23:01,758 --> 00:23:03,426
6:00 to 8:00 p.m.

00:23:03,493 --> 00:23:05,228
Never missed a class
before last night.

00:23:05,295 --> 00:23:06,563
Well, this is
my alma mater.

00:23:06,629 --> 00:23:08,231
Econ 101-- that's Sabian Hall.

00:23:08,298 --> 00:23:10,800
It's a long walk from here
but I know the way.

00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:12,502
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:14,504
I'll have to catch
up with you.

00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:23,780
Damn.

00:23:25,548 --> 00:23:27,383
It's still wet.

00:23:34,224 --> 00:23:36,526
What's the first thing you'd do
if you got paint on your hands?

00:23:38,261 --> 00:23:39,429
Wash it off.

00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:44,934
GRISSOM:
We found glass

00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:47,837
in the lacerations
on her right hand.

00:23:55,478 --> 00:23:58,681
I'll see if I can get
a match from this.

00:23:58,748 --> 00:24:01,918
He painted the railing and just
waited by the water fountain.

00:24:01,985 --> 00:24:03,953
Victim was like a fly
in a spiderweb.

00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:14,264
We just learned something

00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,266
we didn't know about
the prior murders.

00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:19,002
Yes, what the paint
was all about.

00:24:19,068 --> 00:24:21,871
And if we just learned
about it now

00:24:21,938 --> 00:24:24,641
how did the copycat killer know?

00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:28,526
Looks like Debbie isn't

00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:30,728
the only one
who got paint on her hands.

00:24:30,795 --> 00:24:34,065
Well, maybe he was waiting
till he saw the girl he wanted.

00:24:35,366 --> 00:24:36,968
That's creepy.

00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:45,353
I'll call the Fire Department,
get a circular saw.

00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,389
Take this back
to the lab.

00:24:52,861 --> 00:24:55,430
I've got a backpack.

00:24:55,497 --> 00:24:57,899
Wallet...

00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:01,236
Debbie Reston.

00:25:01,302 --> 00:25:02,804
Credit cards...

00:25:02,871 --> 00:25:04,839
money, keys.

00:25:06,508 --> 00:25:09,277
Not what he was looking for.

00:25:12,681 --> 00:25:13,848
What are you doing?

00:25:13,915 --> 00:25:16,718
I found pieces of this
in the victim's hair.

00:25:16,785 --> 00:25:18,453
What's it look like
to you?

00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,655
Hmm, what does
it sound like?

00:25:23,692 --> 00:25:25,727
With the exception
of the termite queen

00:25:25,794 --> 00:25:27,929
the cicada is the longest-living
insect.

00:25:27,996 --> 00:25:30,598
Spends 17 years dormant
underground

00:25:30,665 --> 00:25:34,769
and then the cicada nymph
emerges and sheds its skin.

00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:52,787
As adults they flit
around

00:25:52,854 --> 00:25:55,090
for about five
weeks of activity

00:25:55,156 --> 00:25:57,425
in the hot sun
and then they die.

00:25:57,492 --> 00:26:00,195
They spend their
whole lives waiting
for the end.

00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:02,430
Not unlike death row.

00:26:02,497 --> 00:26:04,866
( <i>high-pitched whirring</i> )

00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,735
WARRICK:
This is the spot.

00:26:40,802 --> 00:26:43,705
You can see the path
and the rail.

00:26:43,772 --> 00:26:45,073
Well, and if
she was trying

00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,342
to clean off her right hand
in this fountain

00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:49,511
she would have had to be
in this position.

00:26:49,577 --> 00:26:51,246
And he waited till
her back was turned...

00:26:51,312 --> 00:26:53,415
and came up behind her.

00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:54,683
I found some more glass.

00:26:57,385 --> 00:26:59,688
Looks polarized.

00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:03,258
Well, lightbulb glass
isn't polarized.

00:27:03,324 --> 00:27:05,894
Eyeglasses are.
Yeah.

00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,395
You know, she was a black belt.

00:27:07,462 --> 00:27:08,496
Maybe she fought back.

00:27:08,563 --> 00:27:10,532
That would explain
why she had defensive wounds

00:27:10,598 --> 00:27:12,100
and none
of the other victims did.

00:27:13,635 --> 00:27:15,870
( <i>yelling</i> )

00:27:21,376 --> 00:27:23,845
Sorry about the "no print"
results on the Mathers' case.

00:27:23,912 --> 00:27:25,313
Make it up to me.

00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,549
I got a new case.
New bag.

00:27:52,807 --> 00:27:55,810
( <i>electrical crackling</i> )

00:28:10,725 --> 00:28:11,926
It's only partial

00:28:11,993 --> 00:28:13,828
but I've got a hit off less.

00:28:13,895 --> 00:28:15,497
Great.

00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:19,634
Hey, you know that black fiber

00:28:19,701 --> 00:28:21,936
that Catherine pulled from
Debbie Reston's hair?

00:28:22,003 --> 00:28:22,937
STOKES:
Yeah.

00:28:23,004 --> 00:28:23,938
It's trilobal.

00:28:24,005 --> 00:28:26,107
Vehicle upholstery.

00:28:26,174 --> 00:28:28,309
It's not from her car.
Her upholstery is red.

00:28:28,376 --> 00:28:29,310
That's good for us.

00:28:29,377 --> 00:28:30,979
She was killed
at the water fountain

00:28:31,046 --> 00:28:32,814
but the body was dumped
at the library.

00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:34,516
You can't carry a body
in plain sight on campus

00:28:34,582 --> 00:28:35,517
even in at night.

00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,452
Odds are decent we're looking
at a fiber

00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:40,588
from the killer's vehicle.

00:28:43,525 --> 00:28:45,360
Generic Chevy.

00:28:45,427 --> 00:28:48,163
Well, that kind
of narrows it down.

00:28:48,229 --> 00:28:50,832
WARRICK:
The glass on the left

00:28:50,899 --> 00:28:52,434
is not polarized.

00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,102
There's not color change.

00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:56,471
What, from the busted
security light?

00:28:56,538 --> 00:28:58,006
Yeah, the one found
in the path.

00:28:58,073 --> 00:28:59,474
Not the one found
in her hand.

00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:01,176
Okay, the guy broke

00:29:01,242 --> 00:29:02,644
the bulb on purpose.

00:29:02,711 --> 00:29:04,512
Gives him an advantage--
cover of darkness.

00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:06,815
I'll buy that, but the glass
on the right was the one

00:29:06,881 --> 00:29:08,383
extracted from the cuts
on her hand.

00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,318
And it matches the glass
that Catherine found

00:29:10,385 --> 00:29:11,319
near the water fountain.

00:29:11,386 --> 00:29:12,420
Confirms that Debbie

00:29:12,487 --> 00:29:13,822
fought with her attacker.

00:29:13,888 --> 00:29:15,623
Suspect's minus

00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,959
one point two five.

00:29:18,026 --> 00:29:20,362
What is that, 20/80?

00:29:20,428 --> 00:29:21,596
That's like half of mine.

00:29:21,663 --> 00:29:23,131
It's not much of a correction.

00:29:23,198 --> 00:29:26,001
Great. We're looking for a guy
with a 20/80 prescription

00:29:26,067 --> 00:29:28,069
who drives a Chevy
with black interior.

00:29:34,242 --> 00:29:35,243
Hey.

00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,512
Got your report from the feds.

00:29:38,546 --> 00:29:39,547
Why did it come to you?

00:29:39,614 --> 00:29:41,583
Because they returned
the DNA evidence to me.

00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:44,152
I took a look
at the results.

00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:45,420
Didn't think you'd mind.

00:29:45,487 --> 00:29:48,323
I do.

00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:51,726
All six hairs are a match
to Mathers.

00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:05,840
He raped and murdered
Charlene Roth.

00:30:05,907 --> 00:30:08,343
Dead bang. Airtight.
Good night, John.

00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,112
How are you coming
with that twist tie, Greg?

00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:12,614
The new case?
Yeah.

00:30:12,681 --> 00:30:13,748
Working on it.

00:30:13,815 --> 00:30:15,717
Good.
Keep working on it.

00:30:19,688 --> 00:30:21,956
Slam dunk on Mathers.

00:30:22,023 --> 00:30:23,391
Good.

00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:26,761
The paint on
Debbie Reston's hands...

00:30:26,828 --> 00:30:28,663
Yeah?

00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,099
...oil-based blue.

00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:32,934
Oil-based?

00:30:33,001 --> 00:30:35,270
That's for canvases,
not railings.

00:30:35,337 --> 00:30:38,973
Not only that, it was mixed
with 30-weight motor oil.

00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,377
Which isn't a component
of any commercial paint.

00:30:42,444 --> 00:30:44,212
As an additive however...

00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,648
keeps paint from drying.

00:30:48,183 --> 00:30:52,420
Okay...
he knew what he was doing.

00:30:52,487 --> 00:30:56,991
Expanding his window
of opportunity.

00:30:57,058 --> 00:30:59,160
Hello?

00:30:59,227 --> 00:31:01,396
Hairs.

00:31:01,463 --> 00:31:03,598
Hopefully from his paintbrush.

00:31:03,665 --> 00:31:06,768
And the paint matches
Western LVU shade of blue.

00:31:06,835 --> 00:31:08,603
He knows a lot about paint.

00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,605
WILLOWS:
<i>He knows a lot</i>
<i>about that campus.</i>

00:31:10,672 --> 00:31:12,474
I don't know
what I can tell you.

00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,142
I've only been here
since '95.

00:31:14,209 --> 00:31:16,611
Well, is there anyone
in the art department

00:31:16,678 --> 00:31:19,247
who was here when
the first murders
took place?

00:31:19,314 --> 00:31:21,883
A couple of the guys
predate me.

00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,284
I'll ask around.

00:31:23,351 --> 00:31:26,121
Are any of these brushes
made with badger hair?

00:31:26,187 --> 00:31:28,957
We artists covet
our brushes.

00:31:30,258 --> 00:31:32,027
That's Russian
blue squirrel...

00:31:32,093 --> 00:31:35,663
Japanese synthetic...
badger.

00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,066
In the oil paint sample
we collected

00:31:38,133 --> 00:31:41,136
we found both badger hair
and nylon bristles.

00:31:41,202 --> 00:31:45,173
Anyone who's studied art
would never use nylon with oils

00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,743
unless they were
using the paint
for something else.

00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:51,046
<i>When brushes age,</i>
<i>they shed hairs.</i>

00:31:51,112 --> 00:31:53,415
<i>Then, if they used</i>
<i>a nylon brush the next time...</i>

00:31:53,481 --> 00:31:55,717
Say I wanted
a badger hair paintbrush--

00:31:55,784 --> 00:31:56,985
where would I buy one?

00:31:57,052 --> 00:31:59,120
Student Union sells them.

00:31:59,187 --> 00:32:01,156
Most art stores.

00:32:01,222 --> 00:32:03,925
You can get them cheaper
on the Internet.

00:32:06,061 --> 00:32:08,396
Sorry. I was admiring
your frames.

00:32:08,463 --> 00:32:10,565
Nice.

00:32:14,302 --> 00:32:16,538
The results are back
on the zip tie

00:32:16,604 --> 00:32:19,974
you removed from
Debbie Reston's wrists.

00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:21,676
No foreign
epithelials

00:32:21,743 --> 00:32:23,511
but I did find
an errant hair

00:32:23,578 --> 00:32:25,046
DNA tag still attached.

00:32:25,113 --> 00:32:27,482
It's not Debbie Reston's.

00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:29,217
Catherine asked me
to cross-check

00:32:29,284 --> 00:32:30,852
everything with the old cases.

00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:33,088
It actually belongs
to Janet Kent.

00:32:33,154 --> 00:32:34,422
Janet Kent-- the first victim?

00:32:34,489 --> 00:32:35,523
I know.

00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:38,226
So Janet Kent's killer
saved some of her hair

00:32:38,293 --> 00:32:41,029
and planted it on
Debbie Reston 15 years later

00:32:41,096 --> 00:32:42,831
on the night
that John Mathers

00:32:42,897 --> 00:32:45,266
was set to be
executed.

00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:46,868
John Mathers is the copycat.

00:32:46,935 --> 00:32:48,103
Yeah.

00:32:48,169 --> 00:32:50,271
And the original killer's
still out there

00:32:50,338 --> 00:32:51,973
playing a really twisted game.

00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:04,985
Oh. Hey.

00:34:05,052 --> 00:34:07,521
Mathers' execution's
back on.

00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:10,057
The Roths asked me
to sit with them.

00:34:10,123 --> 00:34:12,593
Is that a good idea?

00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,194
I just need to do it.

00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,396
Why?

00:34:16,463 --> 00:34:18,131
It's like your
first autopsy...

00:34:18,198 --> 00:34:19,967
your first
murdered child.

00:34:20,033 --> 00:34:21,101
You can make it
through that

00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:22,736
you can keep
doing this work.

00:34:22,803 --> 00:34:24,505
All the paints
match all the victims

00:34:24,571 --> 00:34:26,139
except for Charlene Roth.

00:34:26,206 --> 00:34:28,642
See, being capable of
matching paint samples

00:34:28,709 --> 00:34:30,210
that are 15 years apart

00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,713
that's why I keep
doing this work.

00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:36,116
Well, that's the difference
between you and me.

00:34:36,183 --> 00:34:37,651
Hey.
Hey.

00:34:37,718 --> 00:34:39,553
Dean of the Art School
came up with a name.

00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,687
A Cody Lewis.

00:34:40,754 --> 00:34:43,490
He was a grad student
at WLVU in the late '80s

00:34:43,557 --> 00:34:45,292
same time the three girls
were murdered.

00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,662
He left just after the Roth case
for a post-doc in Louisiana.

00:34:48,729 --> 00:34:50,163
Where is he now?

00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,832
WLVU since September.

00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:53,800
He's an assistant professor
there.

00:34:57,771 --> 00:35:00,274
So you like to paint
dead girls?

00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:03,277
I paint what I feel.

00:35:03,343 --> 00:35:05,112
Yeah, sure.

00:35:05,179 --> 00:35:07,181
You know,
you're an artist.

00:35:07,247 --> 00:35:09,216
So back in '87
when you painted this girl

00:35:09,283 --> 00:35:10,417
what were you feeling?

00:35:10,484 --> 00:35:13,654
That you wanted her to die?

00:35:15,889 --> 00:35:19,760
What's the subject matter
this week?

00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,061
More dead girls?

00:35:21,128 --> 00:35:23,063
I haven't been doing a
lot of painting lately.

00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:25,065
Uh-huh.

00:35:25,132 --> 00:35:28,936
So it's just a coincidence
that another coed gets murdered

00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:30,771
right after you show up
in Vegas, right?

00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:34,675
Listen, I painted that
15 years ago.

00:35:34,741 --> 00:35:36,577
Right after that second
girl was murdered...

00:35:36,643 --> 00:35:38,946
Marjorie something.

00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,214
Really affected me.

00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,882
Affected everyone.

00:35:41,949 --> 00:35:43,417
Yeah, but it affected you more.

00:35:43,483 --> 00:35:45,052
Because you knew
the first victim.

00:35:45,118 --> 00:35:48,188
Janet Kent.

00:35:48,255 --> 00:35:50,591
Yeah, I knew Janet.

00:35:50,657 --> 00:35:52,693
Come on, Cody, man.

00:35:52,759 --> 00:35:54,494
You two had a thing.

00:35:54,561 --> 00:35:55,762
We had a date.

00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:57,865
I took her to a
Springsteen show.

00:35:57,931 --> 00:36:01,535
We had drinks afterwards
and that was it.

00:36:01,602 --> 00:36:03,604
So what, did she reject you?

00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,138
Did she give you

00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:08,408
the "Cody, we can still
be friends"?

00:36:08,475 --> 00:36:09,810
That speech?

00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:11,178
No.

00:36:11,245 --> 00:36:12,913
Never got that far.

00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:16,416
I was just wondering

00:36:16,483 --> 00:36:19,586
because some guys can't
take "no" for an answer.

00:36:19,653 --> 00:36:21,989
But that's not you, right?

00:36:32,933 --> 00:36:34,968
Okay, I'm getting this to Trace.

00:36:35,035 --> 00:36:37,504
Hey, check out
the vehicle's upholstery.

00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:40,474
It's black and
it's a Chevy...

00:36:40,541 --> 00:36:41,675
We got nothing.

00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:43,677
Nobody cleans a car this good.

00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:45,345
There is no evidence
that Debbie Reston

00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:46,947
was transported in this vehicle.

00:36:47,014 --> 00:36:49,917
Still doesn't rule out
Cody Lewis as a suspect.

00:36:49,983 --> 00:36:53,020
You got to wonder when a guy
gives it up this easily.

00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:58,292
Prints, DNA, his car...

00:36:58,358 --> 00:36:59,860
Yeah, well...

00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:02,062
maybe he's thinks
he's some kind of smart guy

00:37:02,129 --> 00:37:04,264
you know,
covering all the bases.

00:37:04,331 --> 00:37:06,500
Or maybe
he didn't do it.

00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:08,902
What's that?

00:37:08,969 --> 00:37:10,437
His prints don't match
the partial

00:37:10,504 --> 00:37:12,506
on the Debbie Reston
trash bag.

00:37:15,776 --> 00:37:17,177
Wonderful.

00:37:17,244 --> 00:37:18,779
Thanks.

00:37:22,216 --> 00:37:25,385
Ammonia... in case
anyone starts to feel...

00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:26,620
unsteady.

00:38:21,441 --> 00:38:22,976
I keep racking my brain

00:38:23,043 --> 00:38:25,646
going over these
unsolved murder cases.

00:38:25,712 --> 00:38:27,514
And I keep coming back
to the fact

00:38:27,581 --> 00:38:29,049
that they're 15 years apart.

00:38:29,116 --> 00:38:32,052
That means
he's either out of town

00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:33,187
or in the joint.

00:38:33,253 --> 00:38:34,655
Why wouldn't he
take his business

00:38:34,721 --> 00:38:36,056
to some other college

00:38:36,123 --> 00:38:37,457
if it was only
about young girls?

00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:38,859
It's got to be personal.

00:38:38,926 --> 00:38:41,161
He wanted to kill
those girls.

00:38:54,508 --> 00:38:56,543
( <i>heart beating</i> )

00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:18,832
( <i>heartbeat slowing</i> )

00:39:44,024 --> 00:39:45,859
I mean, I don't know
much about bugs

00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:48,028
but most animals hunt
in their own backyard.

00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:50,464
True of insects as well.

00:39:50,531 --> 00:39:51,632
You know why?

00:39:51,698 --> 00:39:53,767
It's where they feel
most comfortable.

00:39:53,834 --> 00:39:55,602
And where they can
blend in the best.

00:39:55,669 --> 00:39:59,173
<i>This guy had ties</i>
<i>to Western LVU.</i>

00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:03,177
He paints a railing
on a campus walkway.

00:40:03,243 --> 00:40:05,512
I tried it;
took me about five minutes.

00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:08,148
My guys were all
over that school.

00:40:08,215 --> 00:40:10,651
Nobody remembers
seeing anything.

00:40:10,717 --> 00:40:13,153
Probably because there
wasn't much to see.

00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,789
<i>He must've looked</i>
<i>as though he belonged.</i>

00:40:15,856 --> 00:40:18,458
Like the insects, he blended in.

00:40:18,525 --> 00:40:19,793
( <i>sighs heavily</i> )

00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,195
Yeah.

00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,332
You off the clock?

00:40:25,399 --> 00:40:27,134
I guess.

00:40:27,201 --> 00:40:30,003
( <i>protesters yelling</i> )

00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:41,048
He's going to kill again.

00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,452
Yeah.

00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:47,921
And all we've got
is a partial fingerprint

00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:51,725
and an MO that may lead us
in the right direction.

00:40:51,792 --> 00:40:56,163
You know sometimes
in this job

00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:59,199
I'd rather be lucky
than good.

00:40:59,266 --> 00:41:01,001
Maybe next time
we'll get lucky.

00:41:01,068 --> 00:41:03,670
I don't believe in luck.

00:41:03,737 --> 00:41:07,608
My only real purpose is to be
smarter than the bad guys

00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:10,944
to find the evidence
that they didn't know
they left behind

00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:12,446
and make sense of it all.

00:41:12,792 --> 00:41:16,083
It makes me very uncomfortable
to realize that this guy...

00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:19,286
may be smarter than me.
