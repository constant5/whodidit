After me, there'll be others.

You'll have to go on killing,
on and on until they catch you.

I won't be the last;
there'll be others after me.

I'm going to have to ask
you to turn the phone off.

Whoo! Theaters are
like nightclubs;

00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:53,916
they should always
keep the lights off.

00:00:53,983 --> 00:00:56,552
This is the last art house
left in Vegas.

00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:58,354
I saw Baraka here,

00:00:58,421 --> 00:01:00,623
on a double bill
with Koyaanisqatsi

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,758
Was there anyone
else here?
Sure.

00:01:02,825 --> 00:01:04,260

No.

oozing blood like a broken
bottle of ketchup.

00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:18,975
His name is Gus Sugarman.

Cell phone went off
three times during the movie.

00:01:23,946 --> 00:01:26,782
So, the usher finally
came over to shut him up.

Yeah, somebody
beat him to it.

Single puncture wound
to the base of the skull.

00:01:33,022 --> 00:01:34,023
And nobody saw anything?

Puncture wound is small.
Not a knife.

Seems like it penetrated
all the way to the brain stem,

and there's some bruising
around the mouth.

00:02:40,132 --> 00:02:42,601
Well, the killer could
have stood over him,

00:02:42,668 --> 00:02:43,802
placed his hand over his mouth,

00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:45,170
stabbed him in the back
of the head.

00:02:45,237 --> 00:02:47,873
Didn't Telly Savalas do that

Right.

did you see this in?

DR. ROBBINS:
Looks like somebody ripped
something off his neck.

been a chain, maybe, huh?

Well, whoever called him
didn't leave their number.

00:03:33,953 --> 00:03:36,388
Hey!

00:03:36,455 --> 00:03:39,391
I wasn't the only one who
dropped something tonight.

00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:43,329
I got a witness.

00:03:43,395 --> 00:03:44,763
I only noticed 'cause she got up

00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,231
during the best part
of the movie,

00:03:46,298 --> 00:03:47,433
right before the gunfight.

00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:49,001
Is the gunfight loud?

00:03:49,068 --> 00:03:51,303
Yeah. I mean it's not
THX Surround-sound.

00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,440
This was 1950 and
mono optical track.

00:03:54,506 --> 00:03:56,342
I like how loud
this theater keeps it.

00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:57,543
Perfect moment to do it.

00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,612
Cover up any noise
the victim might make.

00:03:59,678 --> 00:04:01,013
You get a look at her?

00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,748
I drove 40 minutes
to see this flick;

00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:04,083
my eyes were on the screen,

00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:06,652
but, uh, she was tall,

00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:09,121
not old... a redhead.

00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:10,289
Did she come back in?

00:04:10,356 --> 00:04:11,457
No.

00:04:11,523 --> 00:04:12,625
And, uh...

00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:14,760
I-I don't see her here.

00:04:15,928 --> 00:04:17,529

for the night.

had left before we got here.

He had been smoking blunts.

He was afraid we were going
to bust him for marijuana.

I'll be tweaking him when
I call him for my statement.

If you ask me, anybody who
leaves their phone on in a movie

00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,312
deserves to get
stabbed in the head.

below the knees.

Question is not what we're going
to find on the murder weapon;

00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,244
question is what isn't on it.

The sticky substance?

It wasn't the cleanest
theater in the world.

I just want to match
the blood to our victim.

00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:51,590
And you want to know if
there's a recoverable print.

Phone Company unblocked
all his private numbers for us.

00:06:42,608 --> 00:06:43,742
They can do that now?

00:06:43,809 --> 00:06:47,780
Yeah. On the left side of the
screen are the outgoing calls.

00:06:47,846 --> 00:06:50,082
On the right, the incoming.

Last outgoing call your vic made
was at 10:38.

26 seconds.

00:07:02,294 --> 00:07:04,430
That sounds like a no answer.

00:07:04,496 --> 00:07:06,598
Yeah, but 555-0110
was the number

00:07:06,665 --> 00:07:09,101
that called him
three times in a row:

00:07:09,168 --> 00:07:13,672
11:26, 11:27
and 11:28.

00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:15,541
Someone needed
to talk to him
pretty bad.

00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:17,443
Yeah, well, he was
already dead by then.

00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:20,446
Dr. Robbins was that accurate
with the TOD?

00:07:20,512 --> 00:07:22,081
That's when the gunfire erupted.

00:07:22,147 --> 00:07:23,682
There was gunfire?

00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:25,284
In the movie.

00:07:25,351 --> 00:07:27,953

to the movies,

it was a late show,

00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:09,837

early for work.

he'd get my message.

00:10:18,745 --> 00:10:21,181
And why did you call him
three times in a row,
40 minutes later?

00:10:21,248 --> 00:10:23,550
I felt bad standing him up.

00:10:23,617 --> 00:10:25,486
I called to apologize.

00:10:25,552 --> 00:10:27,588
I figured I'd get his Voice
Mail, but when I didn't,

00:10:27,654 --> 00:10:29,189
I tried again.

00:10:29,256 --> 00:10:30,691
And you were here alone?

00:10:30,757 --> 00:10:32,259
Yes.

00:10:32,326 --> 00:10:33,460
Can anyone verify that?

00:10:33,527 --> 00:10:35,529
Why?

00:10:35,596 --> 00:10:38,999
( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:40,868
( <i>ringing continues</i> )

00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:42,536
Still screening?

00:10:42,603 --> 00:10:44,138
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:10:57,184 --> 00:10:59,119
Do you see a lot of movies
at the Art House Theater?

00:10:59,186 --> 00:11:01,855
Sure. I love old movies.

00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:04,224
I see they recently had
a Hitchcock Retrospective.

00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,692
I prefer French New Wave.

00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:08,362
If you'll excuse me now,
I have to go to work.

00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:10,431
We'll be in touch.

00:11:17,571 --> 00:11:19,039
Geez, what was
this kid, tortured?

00:11:19,106 --> 00:11:21,008
Couple of fractured ribs.

00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:23,644
Deep purple contusions
of the presternal chest wall.

00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,779
Each one around two inches
in diameter.

00:11:25,846 --> 00:11:27,581
I stopped counting around nine.

00:11:27,648 --> 00:11:30,017
What do you think
could've done this?
Baseball bat?

00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,718
It's hard to tell.
Whatever it was,

00:11:31,785 --> 00:11:33,554
it had a great deal of velocity.

00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,555
Yeah.

00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:37,024
Cause of death:
single gunshot to the chest.

00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,926
No evidence
of gunshot residue.

00:11:38,992 --> 00:11:42,696
Shot from a distance. Yeah.

00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,906
And at a downward angle...

00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:54,808
It's, uh...

00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:59,046
It's about 25 degrees.

00:11:59,113 --> 00:12:00,914
He was shot from above.

00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:03,283
( <i>gun cocking</i> )

00:12:04,451 --> 00:12:06,687
Rooftop angle is 45 degrees.

00:12:06,753 --> 00:12:08,322
This is 25 degrees?

00:12:10,057 --> 00:12:11,291
It's impossible.

00:12:11,358 --> 00:12:15,329
If that's the case, he was shot
by somebody 10 to 15 feet tall.

00:12:15,395 --> 00:12:17,931
What else you got?

00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:20,968
Scabbing abrasions
on the elbows, the back

00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:23,470
and kneecaps.

00:12:23,537 --> 00:12:26,707
Looks to be harmless
"boys will be boys" stuff.

00:12:26,774 --> 00:12:30,144
There's nothing harmless
about death.

00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,602
Don't tell me--
Greg won the bet.

00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:38,070
The blood on the screwdriver

00:12:38,137 --> 00:12:39,905
definitely belongs
to your victim.

00:12:39,972 --> 00:12:42,475
It was incredible how fast
he got me back the results.

00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,577
I don't know how he does it.

00:12:44,643 --> 00:12:46,912
Now I got to wear
this stupid thing all day.

00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:49,415
Oh, look at him, hovering.

00:12:49,482 --> 00:12:51,450
Making sure
I still have it on.

00:12:51,517 --> 00:12:54,019
Do us all a favor and
get him out in the field,
will you, Grissom?

00:12:54,086 --> 00:12:55,187
He's going stir crazy
in here.

00:12:55,254 --> 00:12:57,323
Jaqui, do you have
anything for us?

00:12:57,389 --> 00:12:59,391
A palm print.

00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,594
Oh, great.
Let's, uh, go back to Audrey's

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,828
and see if we
have a match.

00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:04,663
Not quite.

00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,732
Look at the ridges.

00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,468
Too consistent.

00:13:09,535 --> 00:13:11,470
Looks like fine grain.

00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:12,972
Leather.

00:13:13,038 --> 00:13:14,306
Killer wore gloves.

00:13:14,373 --> 00:13:15,674
BRASS:
Okay...

00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:17,710
here's what's happening--
three months ago,

00:13:17,776 --> 00:13:20,012
Audrey Hilden filed
a sexual malpractice suit

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,947
against our Dr. Sugarman.

00:13:22,014 --> 00:13:23,716
The suit claims that

00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:25,885
she was molested while
she was under anesthesia.

00:13:25,951 --> 00:13:27,787
And she was going on a date
with this guy?

00:13:27,853 --> 00:13:29,321
Yeah. Sugarman
countersued.

00:13:29,388 --> 00:13:32,458
He's represented
by big-time attorneys,
so she backed down.

00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:34,894
Well, a screwdriver's
cheaper than an attorney.

00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,562
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Yeah.

00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:37,897
Well, uh, there's more.

00:13:37,963 --> 00:13:40,666
Remember the usher
who likes to smoke the chronic?

00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:43,502
He claims he saw a redheaded
woman make a phone call

00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:45,738
halfway through the movie,
so I'm going to check it out.

00:13:45,805 --> 00:13:48,774
Want to tag along?

00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,978
This where the
limbo party is?

00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:54,747
Can I come in?
Yeah.

00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:57,049
Sorry, I don't let
everyone in here.

00:13:57,116 --> 00:13:59,051
Well, I've got
your one-to-ones.

00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:01,187
The tire treads,

00:14:01,253 --> 00:14:02,988
there's nothing specific here.

00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:05,257
Bummer.
But the shoe prints
that you took,

00:14:05,324 --> 00:14:07,059
they look interesting.

00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:08,561
It looks like five
suspects walked in,

00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:10,196
and four ran out.

00:14:10,262 --> 00:14:11,831
Four guilty people

00:14:11,897 --> 00:14:12,998
out there somewhere.

00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:14,266
No doubt.

00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,335
How's it coming with
your big bamboo here?

00:14:16,402 --> 00:14:18,437
Well, I have black lung
from all the powder,

00:14:18,504 --> 00:14:20,339
and not a single print,
nothing, <i>nada.</i>

00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:21,674
You test for GSR?

00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,109
The place was riddled with
bullets-- it wouldn't hurt.

00:14:24,176 --> 00:14:25,644
Wouldn't hurt.

00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:42,128
Nothing.

00:14:42,194 --> 00:14:44,029
Maybe this has nothing
to do with the case.

00:14:44,096 --> 00:14:46,899
Maybe it was just a piece
of debris left at the scene.

00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:49,768
No, no. I-I'm not quitting. No.

00:14:49,835 --> 00:14:52,738
I am in too deep.

00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,977
Where you going?
Trace.

00:14:58,043 --> 00:14:59,678
Maybe Hodges can find something.

00:14:59,745 --> 00:15:01,714
Oh, coming through.
Careful, people.

00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:03,549
Easy.

00:15:03,616 --> 00:15:04,750
Hey, Brown. PD called.

00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:05,951
Mrs. McCallum's there.

00:15:06,018 --> 00:15:08,087
The mother.

00:15:08,154 --> 00:15:10,322
Tell them I'm on my way.

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,562
I was getting myself a soda.

00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:18,464
You know,
we're allowed to do that.

00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:20,800
A tall redhead

00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:22,168
came out of the theater,

00:15:22,234 --> 00:15:24,537
and then she made a phone call
from over there.

00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:32,311
From the pay phone.

00:15:32,378 --> 00:15:34,346
What? I... What?
I'm on it. I'm on it.

00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:36,816
Did you happen to notice
if she was wearing gloves?

00:15:36,882 --> 00:15:38,417
Yeah, she was, actually.

00:15:38,484 --> 00:15:40,453
I thought it was really weird,

00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,955
'cause it's, like,
70 degrees in here.

00:15:43,022 --> 00:15:44,623
Did you notice anything else?

00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,426
No. She just threw something
in the trash

00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:49,495
and headed out.

00:15:57,336 --> 00:15:59,738
The cleaning crew's
in the theater now.

00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:02,208
They got a late start
'cause of you guys.

00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:13,953
Excuse me.

00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:15,221
What happened to the garbage

00:16:15,287 --> 00:16:16,689
that was in the can
in the lobby?

00:16:16,755 --> 00:16:18,224
Well, it's already
been bagged up,

00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,359
but it should be
around here somewhere.

00:16:20,426 --> 00:16:23,129
Excuse me.
Where'd you get those gloves?

00:16:23,195 --> 00:16:25,030
If it's garbage,
it's hers.

00:16:25,097 --> 00:16:26,699
They let us keep
whatever we find

00:16:26,765 --> 00:16:29,068
as long as it's been thrown out.

00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:31,537
I'll tell you what--

00:16:31,604 --> 00:16:34,406
I'll buy you a new
pair of gloves.

That's the best part.

00:16:49,588 --> 00:16:50,623
You know us lab rats

00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:52,424

to get through the day.

00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:55,094
I know, I just dumped a sack
of bullets on Bobby Dawson.

00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:57,396
So, why don't you sing me
a tune I want to hear?

00:16:57,463 --> 00:17:00,166
Well... how about...

00:17:00,232 --> 00:17:02,601
Harold Melvin
and the Blue Notes.

00:17:02,668 --> 00:17:04,703
He ain't heavy.

00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,239
He's my brother.

00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:10,376
DNA? From the beer bottles?

00:17:10,442 --> 00:17:12,311
Five different donors--
two of them are related.

00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:13,446
Donor number one,

00:17:13,512 --> 00:17:15,114
Tim McCallum, the victim;

00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:17,149
donor number two,
his relative,

00:17:17,216 --> 00:17:18,751
most likely a brother.

00:17:18,818 --> 00:17:20,886
No telling if he's heavy or not.

00:17:20,953 --> 00:17:23,956
I'm very sorry for your
loss, Mrs. McCallum.

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,394
Are you Timmy's brother?

00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:30,763
Yeah.

00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,532
Kevin's the only son
I have left.

00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:36,068
We were able to
identify Timmy

00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:38,037
by the driver's permit

00:17:38,103 --> 00:17:39,705
that we found at the scene.

00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:41,073
Had he been driving long?

00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,274
A few months.

00:17:42,341 --> 00:17:44,009
I know that law says

00:17:44,076 --> 00:17:46,412
you're supposed to have
an adult present,

00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:48,981
but I work graveyard.

00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:51,817
Kevin usually drives with him.

00:17:51,884 --> 00:17:54,320
What kind of car
does Timmy drive?

00:17:54,386 --> 00:17:55,688
We have a mini-van.

00:17:55,754 --> 00:17:59,291
It's more safe.

00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:01,727
This is an ongoing
investigation,

00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:03,562
so we are going to need
to see that vehicle.

00:18:05,197 --> 00:18:07,666
Do you ever drive
the mini-van, Kevin?

00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:10,002
Sometimes, yeah.

00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:12,638
Did you drive Timmy to the
warehouse the other night?

00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:13,706
No.

00:18:13,772 --> 00:18:14,907
What warehouse?

00:18:14,974 --> 00:18:16,809
We have reason
to believe

00:18:16,876 --> 00:18:19,979
that Kevin was at the
warehouse that night.

00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:22,615
We found his DNA
on some beer bottles.

00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,518
Beer?

00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:26,652
Kevin...

00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:29,955
Mom... I bought beer for Timmy.

00:18:30,022 --> 00:18:31,524
I don't do it all the time.

00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,025
He begged me.

00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:34,560
He... he said

00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:37,363
he was going out partying
with some friends.

00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:38,664
If Mom catches you with these,

00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:39,899
you didn't get them
from me.

00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:41,033
Bro, there's one missing.

00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,203
I got thirsty. Later, freak.

00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:49,441
I took a sip-- I gave him
the rest of the 12-pack.

00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:53,712
Sorry, Mom.

00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:56,015
Mr. Brown,
I don't know what to say.

00:18:56,081 --> 00:19:00,052
I'm a single mother...
I work nights,

00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:02,154
and you can't keep
your eyes on your kids

00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:03,823
all the time.

00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:08,894
At a certain age,
you just have to trust them.

00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:10,629
I understand.

00:19:10,696 --> 00:19:12,531
We are going to need
to keep Kevin here

00:19:12,598 --> 00:19:14,033
to ask him some
more questions

00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:15,768
about that night.

00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:17,269
Do you object?

00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:20,406
N-No.

00:19:23,943 --> 00:19:26,345
Spiral gouges.

00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:27,847
Check it out.

00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:34,587
From tip to tip.

00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:36,255
What do you think
caused these marks?

00:19:36,322 --> 00:19:39,658
Give me more time--
I'm not a miracle worker.

00:19:39,725 --> 00:19:40,960
Well, that's obvious, Hodges.

00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:43,262
If you were a miracle worker,
you wouldn't be rude.

00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:45,030
I wasn't being rude,
I was being curt.

00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:47,032
Rude would be, "When
I know, you'll know."

00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:48,400
Friends?

00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:49,835
No.

00:19:49,902 --> 00:19:52,505
Hodges, how's it coming
with that glass?

00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:56,108
Looks like there's some kind of

00:19:56,175 --> 00:19:57,543
coating on it.

00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,546
More specifically,
crystallized calcium fluoride.

00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:02,214
You ran it through the I.R.?

00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:04,350
Please. I.R. says fluorspar.

00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,119
I say high-end optics.

00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:08,654
Camera lens.

00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:10,790
You think someone
has this murder on tape?

00:20:10,856 --> 00:20:13,125
WILLOWS:
<i>So, the gloves match</i>
<i>the palm print</i>

00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:16,095
on the murder weapon as
well as the pay phone

00:20:16,162 --> 00:20:17,129
in the theater lobby.

00:20:17,196 --> 00:20:18,264
Unfortunately,
there was

00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,632
no epithelials
inside the gloves

00:20:19,698 --> 00:20:21,901
because the cleaning woman
had ammonia on her hands.

00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:23,035
Ah, I see.

00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:25,004
Well, according to this,
a phone call was made

00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,106
from the theater lobby
to Audrey's home at 11:25.

00:20:27,173 --> 00:20:30,176
Well, Audrey called
Dr. Sugarman's cell

00:20:30,242 --> 00:20:32,645
from <i>her</i> home at 11:26.

00:20:32,711 --> 00:20:36,148
Well, obviously, she didn't
make it home in one minute.

00:20:36,215 --> 00:20:37,817
We're looking
for someone else.

00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:40,419
The mysterious redhead
in the theater?

00:20:40,486 --> 00:20:41,754
Maybe Audrey hired a pro

00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:43,889
who called up to say, uh,
"It's done."

00:20:43,956 --> 00:20:46,258
Well, if she couldn't
afford a powerful attorney,

00:20:46,325 --> 00:20:47,760
how did she pay
for a hit man?

00:20:47,827 --> 00:20:49,462
Hit woman.

00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:51,130
Why don't we ask her?

00:20:51,197 --> 00:20:54,333
( <i>knocking on door</i> )

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,035
( <i>disconnect tone beeping</i> )

00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:59,338
You hear that?
Phone's off the hook.

00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:08,948
There must be another way in.

00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:13,219
( <i>beeping continues</i> )

00:21:45,618 --> 00:21:48,721
WILLOWS:
She used an extension cord

00:21:48,788 --> 00:21:52,091
and tied it to the railing
and must have jumped off.

00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:00,733
Yeah, this is Brass.

00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,334
I got a DB.

00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:05,137
Yeah.

00:22:13,913 --> 00:22:16,248
WILLOWS:
Our only suspect

00:22:16,315 --> 00:22:18,617
apparently commits suicide.

00:22:18,684 --> 00:22:20,352
Convenient.

00:22:22,655 --> 00:22:24,924
Too convenient.

00:22:28,727 --> 00:22:30,663
Catherine...

00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:32,398
she's got a whole nother set

00:22:32,465 --> 00:22:34,366
of horizontal marks
on her neck,

00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:35,901
below the cord.

00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:39,605
And postmortem bruising.

00:22:39,672 --> 00:22:41,607
I think she was strangled first,

00:22:41,674 --> 00:22:43,509
and then hanged.

00:22:43,576 --> 00:22:45,177
( <i>groaning</i> )

00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,968
WILLOWS:
No signs of
a break-in...

00:22:47,035 --> 00:22:48,970
or a struggle.

00:22:49,037 --> 00:22:51,806
She may have been killed
by someone she knew.

00:22:51,873 --> 00:22:53,541
She was dragged.

00:22:53,608 --> 00:22:56,544
She's got carpet fibers
on her heels.

00:22:56,611 --> 00:22:59,147
( <i>grunting</i> )

00:22:59,214 --> 00:23:03,084
Yeah, she was dragged over here,
tied off and shoved over.

00:23:03,151 --> 00:23:04,853
( <i>grunting</i> )

00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:13,461
You got something?

00:23:13,528 --> 00:23:15,430
When we were here earlier,

00:23:15,497 --> 00:23:17,899
there was a movie schedule
pinned up there

00:23:17,966 --> 00:23:19,934
that had a handwritten
note on it.

00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:22,837
I'm not sure she
wanted me to see it.

00:23:22,904 --> 00:23:24,873
Now it's gone.

00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:26,941
Maybe she threw it away.

00:24:36,377 --> 00:24:37,579
Venus and Serena.

00:24:37,645 --> 00:24:39,647
Perfect match.

00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:25,193
Timmy's 15, I'm 18.

00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,928
He's got his friends,
I got my friends.

00:25:26,995 --> 00:25:28,196
We don't do
the same things.

00:25:28,263 --> 00:25:29,597
We don't hang together.

00:25:29,664 --> 00:25:30,799
Evidence says
you were there.

00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:32,700
You want to go down
for suspicion of murder?

00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:34,402
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:25:34,469 --> 00:25:36,971
( <i>over speaker</i> ):
Or you want to stop digging
your own grave?

00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:38,706
Just talked
to Bobby Dawson.

00:25:38,773 --> 00:25:40,575
All the bullets came
from the same gun:

00:25:40,642 --> 00:25:42,544
nine-millimeter
semi-automatic.

00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,179
How's this going?

00:25:44,245 --> 00:25:46,981
I found
a 12-pack container

00:25:47,048 --> 00:25:48,116
in the McCallum minivan.

00:25:48,183 --> 00:25:51,519
Sales slip said
"Jenko Liquors."

00:25:51,586 --> 00:25:53,855
I'll check
the surveillance,

00:25:53,922 --> 00:25:56,691
see if we can get
some footage of this guy.

00:25:56,758 --> 00:25:58,293
What is that on his elbow?

00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,694
It's just a scab.

00:25:59,761 --> 00:26:01,096
Got it skateboarding.

00:26:01,162 --> 00:26:02,430
Can we see it?

00:26:02,497 --> 00:26:04,265
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:26:05,934 --> 00:26:08,036
Peel it back.

00:26:15,076 --> 00:26:16,377
Skateboarding?

00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,542
Why don't you stand up
and take off your shirt.

00:26:19,542 --> 00:26:21,000
Don't you guys need
a warrant for that?

00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,934
We get a warrant,

00:26:22,001 --> 00:26:22,792
and we're going
to strip you down

00:26:22,792 --> 00:26:25,729
to nothing, then ask you
to bend over-- choose.

00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:35,277
BROWN:
Geez, man, what
happened to you?

00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,646
Turn around.

00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,716
Those are the same markings
your brother had.

00:26:41,783 --> 00:26:43,583
You want to tell us
what went down here?

00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:45,084
I can't talk about it.

00:26:47,153 --> 00:26:48,855
I'm sorry.

00:26:48,921 --> 00:26:50,356
Hey, listen,

00:26:50,423 --> 00:26:52,959
if-if you're the victim here,
you can tell us.

00:26:53,025 --> 00:26:55,194
Okay?

00:26:58,464 --> 00:27:00,700
Kevin, who did this to you, man?

00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:11,677
Well, there's an awful lot
of water damage, but, um...

00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,479
there's some kind
of an impression.

00:27:13,546 --> 00:27:15,414
GRISSOM:
Well, maybe this
will bring it up.

00:27:17,183 --> 00:27:19,118

It's written above
<i>Strangers On A Train.</i>

<i>Strangers On A Train.</i>

00:27:27,126 --> 00:27:28,528
Is that the one with
the perfect murder?

00:27:28,594 --> 00:27:29,629
Two strangers
meet on a train,

00:27:29,695 --> 00:27:32,031
make a pact to get rid
of each other's problems.

00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:34,367
They figure since neither
has a motive for the killings,

00:27:34,433 --> 00:27:35,568
they won't be caught.

00:27:35,635 --> 00:27:37,503
Life imitating art?

00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:40,673
In the movie, Robert Walker
kills Farley Granger's wife.

00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,542
Granger didn't think
he was serious,

00:27:42,608 --> 00:27:44,844
so when he refuses
to kill Walker's father,

00:27:44,911 --> 00:27:46,546
Walker goes after him.

00:27:46,612 --> 00:27:50,049
So if Audrey
is Farley Granger...

00:27:50,116 --> 00:27:52,752
Who's playing
Robert Walker's part?

It's not a hotel room,
though.

got to go through me.

That's my locker.

00:29:14,033 --> 00:29:15,802

ever wear that wig
when you go out?

Do you like the movies?

I'm sorry I'm late.

What bullet are you on?

00:30:26,739 --> 00:30:29,208
109, finally.

00:30:29,275 --> 00:30:32,011
Height, distance, angle.

00:30:32,078 --> 00:30:33,846
This has been
a very laborious shift.

00:30:33,913 --> 00:30:35,715
Are you in the mood
for a light show?

00:30:35,782 --> 00:30:37,416
Yeah, hook it up.

The trajectory
is all pointing

00:30:43,156 --> 00:30:44,090
in one uniform area.

00:30:44,157 --> 00:30:46,359
Looks like some
kind of a pole.

00:30:46,425 --> 00:30:48,261
Or a bamboo stick.

00:30:48,327 --> 00:30:49,595
( <i>weary laugh</i> )

00:30:49,662 --> 00:30:51,197
The whole case
has been like this.

It's like you can't
wrap your head
around it, you know?

00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,537
A bamboo cane with black swirls
descending downward, no GSR,

109 rods, 109 bullets,

from the same gun.

00:31:14,253 --> 00:31:16,522
Yes.

00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:20,810
Hey.

00:31:20,876 --> 00:31:22,678
Hey, Sara,
I was just coming to get you.

00:31:22,745 --> 00:31:24,166
Surveillance footage
from Jenko Liquor.

00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:26,333
Archie just put together
some black-and-white stills.

Check it out.

Kevin, the older brother,

Looks like he
wasn't alone.

No, you're right.

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,915
He had four other friends
with him, including Timmy.

00:31:35,982 --> 00:31:36,983
And here you go.

00:31:38,284 --> 00:31:39,452
( <i>both chuckling</i> )

00:31:39,518 --> 00:31:41,821
It's a classic
distraction technique.

00:31:41,887 --> 00:31:42,822
Did it many times.

00:31:42,888 --> 00:31:43,956
You go in
with a group of buddies

00:31:44,023 --> 00:31:44,991
and you cause
a little ruckus.

00:31:45,057 --> 00:31:45,992
Store owner
gets flustered.

00:31:46,058 --> 00:31:47,326
He wants the kids
out of his store.

00:31:47,393 --> 00:31:48,327
So, he sells them the beer,

00:31:48,394 --> 00:31:49,462
even though they're underage,

00:31:49,528 --> 00:31:50,630
and of course they drink it.

00:31:50,696 --> 00:31:52,098
Well, you know about the camera
glass Warrick found, right?

00:31:52,164 --> 00:31:54,467
That means someone has this
all on tape.

00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:56,268
I say we track down
the other kids,

00:31:56,335 --> 00:31:58,671
see which one of them thinks
he's Tarantino.

00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:07,513
So, get this-- Anthony Haines
had a sexual harassment suit
filed against him recently.

00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,248
There's a lot of that
going around.

00:32:09,315 --> 00:32:11,784
Uh-huh, from one
of the showgirls.

00:32:11,851 --> 00:32:14,186
Kelly Goodson?

00:32:14,253 --> 00:32:16,589
She claims that he
threatened to fire her

00:32:16,656 --> 00:32:19,191
if she didn't perform
certain sexual favors.

00:32:19,258 --> 00:32:22,295
You know, she had a business
card in her locker--

00:32:22,361 --> 00:32:24,430
Langly &amp;amp; Langly,
Attorneys-at-Law.

00:32:24,497 --> 00:32:26,265
It'd be interesting
to find out...

00:32:26,332 --> 00:32:28,234
If Audrey hired
the same firm?

00:32:28,301 --> 00:32:29,302
She did.

00:32:31,137 --> 00:32:33,105
So, they liked
the same movies...

00:32:33,172 --> 00:32:34,874
they had the same problem...

00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,809
and they hired
the same lawyer?

00:32:36,876 --> 00:32:39,178
Knees bothering you?

00:32:43,749 --> 00:32:48,020
The extension cord used
to strangle Audrey Hilden.

00:32:48,087 --> 00:32:51,857
The dentist's gold chain.

00:32:51,924 --> 00:32:53,492
The murderer's gloves.

00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:56,028
Well, any physical evidence
on those gloves

00:32:56,095 --> 00:32:58,464
would've been compromised
by the ammonia.

00:32:58,531 --> 00:33:01,300
Only on the inside;
not necessarily the outside.

00:33:01,367 --> 00:33:02,702
You use two hands

00:33:02,768 --> 00:33:05,071
to put on gloves.

00:33:05,137 --> 00:33:06,973
You're looking for transfer.

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,675
Special recipe.

00:33:46,646 --> 00:33:50,049
We go to the warehouse
all the time...

00:33:50,116 --> 00:33:53,919
just go there to party,
talk about chicks.

00:33:53,986 --> 00:33:56,088
Sometimes we smoke out.

00:33:56,155 --> 00:33:58,524
You take off your shirt, please?

00:34:11,404 --> 00:34:14,340
I ride BMX bikes...

00:34:14,407 --> 00:34:15,341

Man, I wake up with bruises.

00:34:17,777 --> 00:34:19,679
We were just messing around.

00:34:19,745 --> 00:34:20,846
I'm not.
A kid's dead.

00:34:20,913 --> 00:34:22,014
Back to the question.

00:34:22,081 --> 00:34:23,416
How'd you get the shiner?

We were messing with it,
shooting the walls.

00:34:30,856 --> 00:34:32,358
So, one night,

00:34:32,425 --> 00:34:33,960
I brought my hi-eight camera in,

00:34:34,026 --> 00:34:36,329
and one of the stray bullets
shot my lens out.

You can tell us
and save yourself,

00:34:44,804 --> 00:34:46,872
or you can let the tape tell us.

00:34:46,939 --> 00:34:48,307
It's your call.

You know, the "don't
try this at home" stuff.

00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:07,259
We-We all watched it on TV.

00:35:07,326 --> 00:35:09,362
So, one day, we're bored.

00:35:09,428 --> 00:35:12,531
We started making up
stunts on our own,

00:35:12,598 --> 00:35:14,834

and by morning

00:36:17,063 --> 00:36:18,998
he had it.

00:36:19,065 --> 00:36:20,232

We did it a bunch of times.

00:36:32,745 --> 00:36:36,048
You know, we all took turns
going up on the roof.

00:36:36,115 --> 00:36:40,353
We almost stopped when I
got shot in the arm...

00:36:40,419 --> 00:36:43,055
but we were drunk, and so...

00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:47,793
...we decided to try
it one more time.

I came down from the roof.

00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:21,694
I went over to his side.

00:37:25,698 --> 00:37:30,002
I kept saying... "Come on,
breathe, bro.

You can't die on me, man."

00:37:38,244 --> 00:37:40,313
Why didn't you call
an ambulance?

00:37:40,379 --> 00:37:43,149
I didn't want to get in trouble.

00:37:43,215 --> 00:37:45,017
So, you just left him
for dead?

00:37:45,084 --> 00:37:47,086
It was an accident.

00:37:49,755 --> 00:37:52,591
It's not like
we had a death wish.

00:37:52,658 --> 00:37:54,994

I'm sorry?

00:38:05,738 --> 00:38:08,474
Oh, it's the law firm that
both you and Audrey hired

00:38:08,541 --> 00:38:10,109
to deal with your problems--

00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,944
Gus Sugarman and
Anthony Haines.

00:38:12,011 --> 00:38:16,349
Tony Haines is a pig...
but who's Gus?

00:38:16,415 --> 00:38:20,052
Well, we're guessing
that that's where the
two of you first met,

00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:21,354
at the lawyers'.

00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,656
GRISSOM:
Or they could've met
at the movie theater.

00:38:23,723 --> 00:38:25,024
Right. Right.

00:38:25,091 --> 00:38:27,760
I mean, either way, you
ladies had a lot in common.

00:38:33,032 --> 00:38:34,233
Boy, can't you see them

00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,469
watching <i>Strangers</i>
<i>on a Train</i> together?

00:38:36,535 --> 00:38:38,204
Oh, yeah.

00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,573
GRISSOM:
I'm thinking that Audrey
told her everything

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,110
about her dentist, and she told
Audrey everything about Haines.

00:38:44,176 --> 00:38:46,612

So, right out of
<i>Strangers on a Train,</i>

00:38:55,254 --> 00:38:57,156
if you swapped murders,

00:38:57,223 --> 00:38:59,625
no one could tie you
to the victims,

00:38:59,692 --> 00:39:02,395
and then you started
talking specifics--

00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:08,013
where the best place
would be to kill Haines...

00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,683
someplace dark, secluded--

00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:14,853
the parking lot right
here at the Sphere.

00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:20,668
After you stabbed Sugarman,

00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:22,803
you ripped the gold
chain off of his neck

00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,039
as proof that you'd kept up
your end of the bargain.

00:39:33,347 --> 00:39:34,982
And then you walked
out into the lobby

00:39:35,049 --> 00:39:36,584
and called Audrey
on the pay phone,

00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,952
to say that the
deed was done.

00:39:38,018 --> 00:39:41,222
And then Audrey
called Sugarman
three times in a row

00:39:41,288 --> 00:39:42,690
to see if it was true.

00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:45,426
She was the one
who picked the movie...

00:39:45,493 --> 00:39:46,827
and made the date.

00:39:48,362 --> 00:39:51,499
But that's all she
did, isn't it?

00:39:51,565 --> 00:39:53,067
'Cause just like
in the movie,

00:39:53,134 --> 00:39:55,236
she had no intention
of killing Haines...

00:39:55,302 --> 00:39:58,472
and that's when you
started harassing her.

00:40:04,545 --> 00:40:05,880
WILLOWS:
<i>You'd killed for her.</i>

00:40:05,946 --> 00:40:08,182
Now she wasn't holding up
her end of the bargain.

00:40:08,249 --> 00:40:10,818
GRISSOM:
You couldn't let
her betray you.

00:40:10,885 --> 00:40:12,720
So, unfortunately,
she had to die, too.

00:40:24,198 --> 00:40:25,633
<i>So, you made it look like</i>

00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:26,767
she'd committed suicide,

00:40:26,834 --> 00:40:29,270
and then you planted Sugarman's
gold chain, in hopes

00:40:29,336 --> 00:40:31,172
that we would think
that she killed him, too.

00:40:31,238 --> 00:40:32,773
The only thing that
she had on you was

00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,075
that movie schedule.

00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:36,877
That had to go.

00:40:38,746 --> 00:40:40,514
( <i>toilet flushing</i> )

00:40:40,581 --> 00:40:43,117
Wow...

00:40:43,184 --> 00:40:45,085
that is a really good story.

00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:48,789
You guys must be
movie fans yourselves.

00:40:48,856 --> 00:40:50,057
You're right.

00:40:50,124 --> 00:40:52,126
It's just a story...

00:40:53,828 --> 00:40:55,596
...but the chemicals

00:40:55,663 --> 00:40:57,431
that we found
on your gloves

00:40:57,498 --> 00:41:01,168
and on the extension cord
that was used to kill Audrey,

00:41:01,235 --> 00:41:02,369
that's our proof.

00:41:02,436 --> 00:41:06,440
Menthol... trolamine
salicylate...

00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:09,110
capsaicin...

00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,549
Eucalyptabalm...

00:41:15,616 --> 00:41:17,551
Isorcreme...

00:41:17,618 --> 00:41:19,453
capsaicin ointment--

00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,324
a unique concoction--
<i>your</i> unique concoction...

00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:28,362
...and this stuff is
all over the evidence.

00:41:28,429 --> 00:41:30,731
Yeah...

00:41:30,798 --> 00:41:33,267
it's a pretty good movie.

00:41:33,334 --> 00:41:35,469
Well, the character that
you've been playing,

00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:38,639
the character that Robert
Walker played in the movie...

00:41:38,706 --> 00:41:42,243
he dies at the end.

00:41:45,646 --> 00:41:46,981
( <i>movie music playing</i> )

00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:48,149
( <i>gunshot fires</i> )

00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:49,917
( <i>dramatic movie music playing)</i>

00:41:52,353 --> 00:41:55,823
MAN:
I said he'd be alone.

00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:58,793
Hi.

00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:02,329
What'd I miss?

00:42:02,396 --> 00:42:06,000
Murder, seduction,
deceit-- the usual.

00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:07,434
Mm.

00:42:07,501 --> 00:42:11,772
This one of your favorites?

00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,642
Actually, I'm not a
big fan of noir.

00:42:16,977 --> 00:42:20,281
Okay.

00:42:20,347 --> 00:42:26,053
Well, what <i>do</i> you like?

00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:36,797
I like silent movies.
