Yeah, yeah. No.

00:00:53,894 --> 00:00:54,928
All right.

00:00:54,995 --> 00:00:57,030
Yeah, hold on,
hold on.

00:00:57,097 --> 00:00:58,665
Happy hour. Joint was packed.

00:00:58,732 --> 00:01:00,934
Two fatalities, four critical.

00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:02,135
How about the driver?

00:01:02,202 --> 00:01:03,604
Nonresponsive.

00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,539
I've got
a GCS of three.

00:01:05,606 --> 00:01:07,140
I need to intubate.

00:01:07,207 --> 00:01:08,675
WILLOWS:
That's Sara's boyfriend.

00:01:08,742 --> 00:01:10,844
Hey, Sara. Typical Thursday.

00:01:12,112 --> 00:01:13,447
Hank?

00:01:13,514 --> 00:01:14,882
Your wrist is broken.

00:01:17,885 --> 00:01:19,253
Larry, take over, will you?

00:01:22,422 --> 00:01:24,258
The car's dry.

00:01:24,324 --> 00:01:26,260
This must've happened
right before the rain.

00:01:28,862 --> 00:01:30,364
I was sitting at the table.

00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,532
Next thing I knew...

00:01:31,598 --> 00:01:32,833
MAN:
I got a heartbeat!

00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,735
Excuse me.

00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,143
Some happy hour, huh?

00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,979
I think

You okay?

00:02:32,563 --> 00:02:33,765
Yeah.

00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:36,234
I didn't think
I'd see you tonight.

00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:38,703
So that's what
all this is about.

00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:41,993
Thanks.

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,228
Any time.

00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:45,030
Listen, I got to head
over to the hospital,

00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:46,765
and I'm sure you got
to get back to work.

00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:48,066
Yeah, but...

00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:50,769
will you call me if
you need anything?

00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:52,103
My cell will be on.

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,538
Anything.

00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:02,414
You and Catherine are running
the evidence on this.

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,316
Warrick just got done
with Internal Affairs.

00:03:04,382 --> 00:03:05,383
He's on his way.

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,619
You need to talk to the
restaurant manager, too.

00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:08,920
Anything else?

00:03:08,987 --> 00:03:09,921
No.

00:03:09,988 --> 00:03:11,022
Where are you going?

00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:12,924
I got gas.

00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:13,925
Oh.

00:03:13,992 --> 00:03:16,394
Residential gas leak
in Henderson.

00:03:19,364 --> 00:03:20,500
Are you the
restaurant manager?

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,468
Yes.

00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,536
I'm Sara Sidle,
Crime Lab.

00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:23,703
Oh, hi, Fred Lychock.

00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,905
Ooh, sorry.

00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:28,166
Um... your supervisor
asked for a seating chart.

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,469
Everything's computerized--
software program.

00:03:31,536 --> 00:03:34,505
This here'll show you
the number of people per table.

00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:35,984
Where were you during the crash?

00:03:36,051 --> 00:03:38,153
I was at the register,
behind the bar.

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,554
Did you see anything?

00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:42,357
A blurry Jaguar speeding
through the intersection.

00:03:44,192 --> 00:03:45,360
I thought the car
would slow down,

00:03:45,427 --> 00:03:46,361
but it kept
right on coming.

00:03:46,428 --> 00:03:47,496
If you ask me,
that's the reason

00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:49,131
why old people don't
belong behind the wheel.

00:03:49,197 --> 00:03:50,766
Yeah, I didn't ask you.

00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:52,334
Thanks for your time.

00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:57,708
I'm sorry.
I got wrapped up in...

00:03:58,875 --> 00:03:59,750
Hank.

00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,285
Yeah.

00:04:01,352 --> 00:04:03,887
An old Jaguar
with a GPS unit.

00:04:03,954 --> 00:04:05,055
That's strange.

00:04:05,122 --> 00:04:08,058
Yeah, not your
granny's Oldsmobile.

00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,527
GRISSOM:
<i>We're cleared to go in?</i>

00:04:10,594 --> 00:04:11,595
Yeah.

00:04:11,662 --> 00:04:13,897
Gas company shut off the valve
at the street.

00:04:13,964 --> 00:04:15,633
Paramedics aired out the scene.

00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:17,501
STOKES:
Homicide radioed
in a D.B.?

00:04:17,568 --> 00:04:18,769
Vanessa Arnz.

00:04:18,836 --> 00:04:20,971
She's in the
master bedroom.

00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,607
GRISSOM:
Thanks.

00:04:28,178 --> 00:04:31,148
The gas company spikes its
natural gas with mercaptan--

00:04:31,215 --> 00:04:32,883
smells like rotten eggs.

00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,286
I don't
smell anything.

00:04:35,352 --> 00:04:37,721
GRISSOM:
All's I smell is mothballs
and stale tobacco.

00:04:37,788 --> 00:04:39,523
STOKES:
Science geek.

00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:43,827
Takes one to know
one, I guess.

00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,802
Hello, David.

00:04:51,869 --> 00:04:53,070
Hey.

00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:56,440
She's hot pink,
like a maraschino.

00:04:56,507 --> 00:04:58,275
Makes our job easier.

00:04:58,342 --> 00:05:01,345
Death was not the result
of natural gas inhalation.

00:05:01,412 --> 00:05:03,414
No, but carbon monoxide's
still gas.

00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,850
Right, when carbon monoxide
displaces oxygen in the blood,

00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:11,055
victim asphyxiates,
turns... pink.

00:05:19,897 --> 00:05:21,966
Was Mr. Arnz
in bed with her?

00:05:22,032 --> 00:05:22,967
Uh, yeah.

00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:24,635
Paramedics said they
found them both in here.

00:05:24,702 --> 00:05:27,471
So why is she dead
and he's alive?

00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:31,842
You know, Dave,
when I was a CSI-One,

00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:33,510
I would've tried to answer that,

00:05:33,577 --> 00:05:35,346
but now I know
"where" before "why."

00:05:35,412 --> 00:05:37,681
First step, find
the source of the C.O.

00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:39,483
I'll grab the Nighthawk,

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,285
fire it up.

00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:46,323
Mr. Arnz has been
stabilized.

00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,891
They're preparing
him for transport.

00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,660
I want to take a look at him.

00:05:49,727 --> 00:05:50,761
Yeah.

00:05:54,064 --> 00:05:55,966
I wake up in the middle
of the night sometimes,

00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:57,668
if I get cold.

00:05:57,735 --> 00:05:59,336
Vanessa steals the covers.

00:05:59,403 --> 00:06:01,972
Uh, I woke up and my
head was spinning.

00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,575
I think I'm coming
down with something.

00:06:04,642 --> 00:06:07,845
Then I look over at her...

00:06:09,046 --> 00:06:10,047
( <i>gasping</i> )

00:06:10,114 --> 00:06:11,248
Vanessa.

00:06:11,315 --> 00:06:12,383
( <i>clattering</i> )

00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:13,651
( <i>phone dialing</i> )

00:06:13,717 --> 00:06:15,119
My wife isn't breathing.

00:06:15,185 --> 00:06:17,121
Do you remember
anything else?

00:06:18,455 --> 00:06:20,224
No, I don't remember
hanging up the phone.

00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,258
I must've
passed out.

00:06:21,325 --> 00:06:22,259
Next thing I know

00:06:22,326 --> 00:06:24,461
the paramedics
are taking me out.

00:06:24,528 --> 00:06:25,462
PARAMEDIC:
We got to roll.

00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:27,097
Patient will be
at Desert Palm.

00:06:27,164 --> 00:06:28,866
Wait a minute.
What about my boy?
Peter seems fine.

00:06:28,933 --> 00:06:30,034
The kid's 18.

00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,635
Signed an AMA.

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,045
Peter...

00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:42,313
my name's
Gil Grissom.

00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:46,183
I'm with the Las Vegas
Crime Lab.

00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,619
You want to ask me questions.

00:06:50,354 --> 00:06:52,423
I was in my bedroom,
asleep.

00:06:52,489 --> 00:06:53,791
I heard the doorbell.

00:06:53,857 --> 00:06:55,225
It was the paramedics.

00:06:55,292 --> 00:06:58,295
A few minutes later,
the police showed up.

00:07:00,864 --> 00:07:03,934
I'm very sorry about what
happened to your mother.

00:07:04,001 --> 00:07:05,836
Why are you sorry?

00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:08,172
You're
not responsible.

00:07:08,238 --> 00:07:10,040
You didn't know her.

00:07:10,107 --> 00:07:12,476
You don't know me.

00:07:21,852 --> 00:07:23,153
How's she doing?

00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,688
Doctors are working
on her right now.

00:07:24,755 --> 00:07:27,391
Doesn't look good.

00:07:28,692 --> 00:07:30,194
Relative?

00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:33,397
Driver's been I.D.'d
as Diane Lambert.

00:07:33,464 --> 00:07:35,499
That's her
grandson Corey.

00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:39,103
Hi, Corey?

00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:41,672
I'm, uh, Sara Sidle.

00:07:41,739 --> 00:07:43,641
I'm with the Las Vegas
Crime Lab.

00:07:43,707 --> 00:07:46,043
Do you mind if I ask you
a couple questions?

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,512
I don't even know
why she was in Las Vegas.

00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:49,680
We live in Laughlin.

00:07:49,747 --> 00:07:50,948
She hates it here.

00:07:51,015 --> 00:07:54,451
Corey, um... did your
grandmother own a Jaguar?

00:07:54,518 --> 00:07:56,420
Yeah... ( <i>sniffles</i> )

00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:58,956
Yeah, she won it in the, uh,
quarter slots.

00:07:59,023 --> 00:08:01,659
First two coins and bingo.
Triple stars.

00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:04,295
She also win the GPS?

00:08:04,361 --> 00:08:05,863
No.

00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,865
She hadn't been
driving it much.

00:08:07,932 --> 00:08:09,967
Uh, she got lost
a couple times

00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:11,669
and it scared her,

00:08:11,735 --> 00:08:13,971
so for her birthday last month,
I bought her the unit.

00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:15,539
Can you excuse me for a second?

00:08:15,606 --> 00:08:16,840
Yeah.

00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:21,045
Hey.

00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:22,746
Hey.

00:08:22,813 --> 00:08:24,882
And the EMT of the year
award goes to...

00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:25,916
Not me.

00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:27,551
Death toll's now three.

00:08:27,618 --> 00:08:29,086
Could climb to four.

00:08:29,153 --> 00:08:31,622
Elaine-- the girl
in the wheelchair--

00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:33,157
she's one of the lucky ones.

00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:35,159
You were amazing.

00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:36,594
Eight years in the rig,

00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,896
first time I've actually
been a part of the scene.

00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:41,665
I can't stop it
going through my head.

00:08:41,732 --> 00:08:45,703
Yeah, you never know when
your life's going to change.

00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:48,072
Listen, I...
I got to get out of here.

00:08:48,138 --> 00:08:50,774
You need a lift?

00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:53,110
No, I drove.

00:08:54,612 --> 00:08:55,946
Hank?

00:08:57,748 --> 00:09:00,117
I'm really glad you're okay.

00:09:00,184 --> 00:09:02,019
Thanks.

00:09:09,593 --> 00:09:12,830
Plenty of tire treads,
but nothing looks fresh.

00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:14,932
So you going to
tell me how it went?

00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:17,201
I got called in
by Internal Affairs.

00:09:17,268 --> 00:09:18,869
How do you think it went?

00:09:18,936 --> 00:09:20,037
Too many questions.

00:09:20,104 --> 00:09:21,338
Thanks.

00:09:21,405 --> 00:09:22,906
I wish I could've
pleaded the Fifth.

00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:24,642
Yeah, you don't answer
their questions,

00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,210
you're looking
at more days off

00:09:26,277 --> 00:09:27,645
without pay,
and that blows.

00:09:27,711 --> 00:09:29,246
Yeah.

00:09:30,247 --> 00:09:32,316
It's a red light camera.

00:09:32,383 --> 00:09:34,051
Did any of
the witnesses

00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:35,786
see the driver
run the red light?

00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:37,655
Nobody mentioned it,
but the camera's there.

00:09:37,721 --> 00:09:38,989
Big Brother knows.

00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:40,858
I'll put in a call.

00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:43,427
WILLOWS:
Black gold.

00:09:46,797 --> 00:09:48,432
Now, that looks fresh.

00:09:48,499 --> 00:09:49,934
( <i>car accelerating</i> )

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,335
( <i>metallic clank</i> )

00:09:51,402 --> 00:09:55,306
Hitting the curb could've
caused the car to buck.

00:10:01,211 --> 00:10:05,416
Traffic light,
intersection, curb.

00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:08,786
Well, either the
car wasn't working,
or the driver wasn't.

00:10:17,595 --> 00:10:20,798
Looks like the newspaper
dispenser used to be here.

00:10:20,864 --> 00:10:22,166
( <i>car accelerating</i> )

00:10:22,232 --> 00:10:23,567
( <i>metallic clank</i> )

00:10:28,038 --> 00:10:29,907
Catherine.

00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:33,811
Tire treads.

00:10:33,877 --> 00:10:35,179
That kills one theory.

00:10:35,246 --> 00:10:37,248
Car's brakes
must've been working.

00:10:37,314 --> 00:10:40,651
She tried to stop,
but it was too late.

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:43,750
Let me guess:

00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,851
no air bags
in the vehicle.

00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,659
No.

00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:49,195
Preliminary cause of death,
epidural hematoma.

00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:51,264
Her head impacted
the steering wheel.

00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:52,865
( <i>glass shattering</i> )

00:10:52,932 --> 00:10:55,868
Blood accumulated between
the inner table of the skull

00:10:55,935 --> 00:10:57,870
and the dural
membrane.

00:10:57,937 --> 00:10:59,505
Her injury is consistent

00:10:59,572 --> 00:11:01,574
with a severed middle
meningeal artery.

00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:02,975
What about pre-impact?

00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:05,712
At the risk of feeding
a stereotype, she was 72.

00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:08,715
Any indication of stroke,
Alzheimer's, heart attack?

00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:12,125
I considered and dismissed
all age-related factors.

00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,208
No arthritis,

00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,875
no significant
impairment of her senses.

00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,111
She has had part
of her colon removed,

00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,412
probably due
to injury

00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,614
or prior medical condition,

00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,650
but Sara, it's irrelevant
to your case.

00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:27,353
I found no physiological
explanation for the crash.

00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,755
Well, that's a bummer,

00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:31,391
'cause at this point, we got
no forensic one, either.

00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,560
STOKES:
Carbon monoxide fills the air

00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,829
when any carbon-based
substance is ignited.

00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,197
( <i>detector beeps slowly</i> )

00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,565
The kid checks out, so...

00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,867
the point of ignition's
probably this room.

00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:42,735
Now, the two
most common causes

00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,238
for accidental
household C.O. poisoning:

00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:46,606
unvented space heaters

00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,775
and improperly
maintained chimneys.

00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,376
I don't see any heaters.

00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,146
My dad's a fireman.

00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,015
Last Christmas, he gave
all the kids C.O. detectors.

00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,984
( <i>beeping faster</i> )

00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,420
Would've saved
this woman's life.

00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,055
25 parts per million.

00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,991
That's the highest
reading in the room.

00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,562
This is a natural gas
burning fireplace.

00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,564
Burns clean.

00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:13,833
C.O. fumes should be
minimal at best.

00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,875
Foreign substance.

00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,643
Still warm.

00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:31,984
There was something other than
natural gas burning in here.

00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,186
If the gas company
hadn't shut off the gas,

00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,055
whatever that is
probably burned up.

00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:39,325
Chimneys are designed
to funnel smoke up and out.

00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:42,294
If this fireplace
was the source of the C.O.,

00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:45,898
the fumes should've
traveled up the chimney

00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,601
instead of permeating the room.

00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,670
LOCKWOOD:
Unless the chimney
isn't doing its job.

00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:54,039
( <i>clanging</i> )

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,876
Damper's busted.

00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,879
( <i>creaking</i> )

00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:10,122
Foreign fuel source
in a compromised chimney...

00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,858
I think we just ruled out
accident.

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,932
Hey, I hear you're
working on Hank's case.

00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,301
I believe
it's <i>my</i> case.

00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:23,302
Territorial.

00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,204
You know, guys
don't like that.

00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,605
You're crowding me,
Greg.

00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,240
Well, I have
some information

00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,142
that could bring
us even closer.

00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,344
But you first.

00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,346
What are we looking at?

00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,082
I downloaded the memory
from the GPS in the Jaguar.

00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,919
She wasn't a local; I wanted
to see if she got lost.

00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,153
SANDERS:
Well, did she?

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,221
Diane Lambert

00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,356
lives in Laughlin.

00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,624
Excuse me.

00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,529
She took 95 North

00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:54,833
to Summerlin Parkway.

00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,136
Then she took Parkway
to Rampart,

00:13:57,202 --> 00:13:59,004
made a left on Main Street

00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,640
and headed straight
to Meadows Lane--

00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,108
16 North Meadows Lane.

00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,677
That's where
she was going,

00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,111
and that's where
she ended up.

00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,347
So does that thing tell you <i>why?</i>

00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,449
What do you have, Greg?

00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,418
Well, maybe
she had the munchies.

00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,753
Tox screen came back.

00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,057
Mrs. Lambert tested positive
for <i>cannabis sativa.</i>

00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:18,924
Grass?

00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,427
"Grass"? So '70s, man.

00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,228
Sticky green, the dank.

00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:26,265
The chronic, the cush,
happy stick, wacky-tobaccy...

00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,766
Well, wait, wait, wait.

00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:28,901
Grandma was high?

00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:29,768
Yeah.

00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,036
Grandma was high.

00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,071
( <i>inhales</i> )

00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,138
As a kite.

00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,274
Hey.
Return visit, huh?

00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,009
You're here
about the tox screen.

00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:40,145
Yeah. Was Diane Lambert
legally impaired?

00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,514
Less than two nanograms
of THC,

00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,316
so per NIDA,
she wasn't.

00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,253
Oh. But, if she were
a long-time user,

00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:50,656
her reaction time could've been
slowed down, right?

00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,558
I know where you're going.
Let me stop you.

00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,761
THC has no significant
cumulative effect,

00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:59,331
so maybe the question
you should be asking is:

00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,334
Why was a woman
her age doping up?

00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,504
Okay, why was a woman
her age doping up?

00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,074
Tell you what-- check
out her optic nerve.

00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,847
SIDLE:
Nerve's damaged.

00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,081
She had glaucoma.

00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,716
I thought you said
she was in good health.

00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,685
That was before the
tox screen came back.

00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,687
You know, it's not
standard procedure

00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,691
to check for glaucoma, but
the Mary Jane tipped me off.

00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,993
People think it slows the
progression of the disease,

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,895
but it just reduces
the pressure in the eye

00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,497
and that reduction's
only temporary.

00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:34,900
Prescription medications
do a much better job.

00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,770
Unfortunately, they don't
have the same side effects.

00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,672
Her vision could've been
impaired by the glaucoma.

00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,507
It didn't affect
her driving.

00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:45,344
Sara, Diana Lambert has
nothing more to tell you.

00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,181
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:56,989
Hello.

00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,958
Oh, hey.

00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:02,561
So, I got photos of
the restaurant patrons

00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,363
off the DMV database

00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,498
and input the information

00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:11,170
per the restaurant seating
chart and the police report.

00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,973
Who's Elaine Alcott?

00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,007
Who?

00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,709
Oh, well, she was
seated with Hank.

00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,077
I just thought
maybe that...

00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,713
Oh.

00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,916
Anyway, um...

00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,384
Apparently, she told PD

00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:28,153
that she was returning
from the ladies' room

00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,955
at the time
of the impact.

00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,190
They must be friends.

00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,225
I saw him with her
at the hospital.

00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,227
Okay.

00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:39,632
Um... okay, so, we've got
36 people in the restaurant.

00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,902
12 worked for Sillmont
Healthcare, a block away.

00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,536
Another ten were from

00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,138
the brokerage firm
across the street,

00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,340
a couple of regulars,
a few out-of-towners and...

00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:49,608
restaurant employees.

00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,211
You know how long it
takes to get in touch

00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,546
with <i>anybody</i> at the
Transportation Safety Bureau?

00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:55,614
It's way out of hand.

00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,615
Diane Lambert

00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,651
ran the light.

00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:05,190
WILLOWS:
Wow. She sped through
that intersection--

00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,191
52 miles per hour.

00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,860
That's more than twice
the speed limit.

00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,862
Well, the tread marks
tell us

00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,730
that her brakes did work,

00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:15,634
so it must've been something
else that malfunctioned,

00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,069
causing her
to accelerate.

00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,238
Gas pedal could've
gotten stuck, or...

00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,073
throttle plate could've jammed.

00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,875
There's only one
way to find out.

00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,443

No. Car checks out perfectly.

Well, I did some more
digging down at the TSB.

00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:26,572
I found out that the red light
camera that photo'd our driver

I'd come by.

00:18:48,164 --> 00:18:50,866
You're checking
up on me again.

00:18:50,933 --> 00:18:54,070
No, I'm checking up
on my evidence.

00:18:54,136 --> 00:18:55,471
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:18:55,538 --> 00:18:59,375
You think if you hover,
the FTIR will work faster?

00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:02,878
Yeah... Hodges,
that's what I think.

00:19:02,945 --> 00:19:05,214
HODGES:
Hey, boss.

00:19:05,281 --> 00:19:07,250
( <i>printer whirring</i> )

00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:07,917
Nice timing.

00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,602
The foreign substance in
the fireplace is carbon.

00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:18,037
Associated minerals?

00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:20,205
None. Pure,

00:19:20,272 --> 00:19:22,441
unadulterated carbon.

00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:24,943
It may be pure,
but it's not solid.

00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,479
Micro-pores.

00:19:27,546 --> 00:19:29,882
Sample's under the scope.

00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,693
GRISSOM:
Activated charcoal?

00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:44,463
Used in filtration
systems, kitty litter,

00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,298
some medications...

00:19:46,365 --> 00:19:49,568
And possibly a murder.

00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,502
BROWN:
The building has
mirrored glass on it.

00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,834
Lets in the light,
but it keeps out the glare.

00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:58,669
SIDLE:
Sun sets in the
west behind us.

00:19:58,736 --> 00:20:00,671
Glare could be pretty
intense in the afternoon.

00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:04,228
This could explain why this
intersection is so dangerous.

00:20:04,295 --> 00:20:06,163
So you think the
sun was a factor
in the crash?

00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,233
Well, according
to the accident report,

00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,569
the sun set
at 5:30 yesterday.

00:20:11,635 --> 00:20:13,504
The accident
was at 5:15,

00:20:13,571 --> 00:20:16,040
so the sun was
still in the sky.

00:20:16,106 --> 00:20:18,175
Trees and buildings
extend at least

00:20:18,242 --> 00:20:20,211
ten degrees above
the western horizon.

00:20:20,277 --> 00:20:21,912
Yeah.

00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:25,549
All right, well,
there's 24 hours in a day,

00:20:25,616 --> 00:20:28,586
360 degrees
in the Earth's rotation.

00:20:28,652 --> 00:20:33,657
360 divided by 24 is... 15?

00:20:33,724 --> 00:20:37,328
15. Sun moves
about 15 degrees an hour.

00:20:54,178 --> 00:20:57,882
At 5:15 yesterday, the sun
would've been about what--

00:20:57,948 --> 00:21:02,019
3.75 degrees
above the horizon?

00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:03,387
Wow, you're fast.

00:21:03,454 --> 00:21:04,989
3.75, huh?

00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,391
Then the sun was
behind the trees

00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,426
at the time
of the accident,

00:21:09,493 --> 00:21:10,694
so it was not a factor.

00:21:10,761 --> 00:21:13,697
Great, and our investigation
is still in the dark.

00:21:13,764 --> 00:21:17,902
( <i>rock music blaring</i> )

00:21:17,968 --> 00:21:19,570
( <i>music stops</i> )

00:21:19,637 --> 00:21:22,139
I just got a page
from James Watson.

00:21:22,206 --> 00:21:24,508
And I got one
from Francis Crick.

00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:26,143
What's going on, Greg?

00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,411
Well, as you both know,

00:21:27,478 --> 00:21:29,580
Watson and Crick
are the granddaddies of DNA.

00:21:29,647 --> 00:21:32,616
Without their discoveries,
I'd have nothing to do all day.

00:21:32,683 --> 00:21:34,652
What <i>have</i> you been doing
all day?

00:21:34,718 --> 00:21:37,988
A tox report on your d.b.,
Ms. Pretty in Pink.

00:21:38,055 --> 00:21:40,090
She died
of carbon monoxide poisoning.

00:21:40,157 --> 00:21:41,358
Blood saturation level

00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,927
of 46.2%.

00:21:42,993 --> 00:21:44,428
No surprise there.

00:21:44,495 --> 00:21:47,431
Nicotine levels are high--
she was a smoker.

00:21:47,498 --> 00:21:50,201
And she popped a couple
of sleeping pills that night.

00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,169
Nothing probative.

00:21:52,236 --> 00:21:54,238
What if I told you that Mr. Arnz

00:21:54,305 --> 00:21:57,575
had a carbon monoxide blood
saturation level of 37%--

00:21:57,641 --> 00:21:59,543
nearly 10% lower
than his wife.

00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,878
Mrs. Arnz was a smoker.

00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,446
Typically, a smoker's blood

00:22:02,513 --> 00:22:04,415
is already 10% saturated
with C.O.

00:22:04,482 --> 00:22:06,417
STOKES:
You mean smokers
get a jump start

00:22:06,484 --> 00:22:07,751
on the poisoning process?

00:22:07,818 --> 00:22:09,487
Could explain
the 10% difference.

00:22:09,553 --> 00:22:12,022
It could also explain
why he lived and she died.

00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:14,125
Nice theory,
but what if I told you

00:22:14,191 --> 00:22:17,027
that Mr. Arnz had high
nicotine levels as well.

00:22:17,094 --> 00:22:18,729
They were both smokers.

00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,965
That still doesn't explain
why one lived and one died.

00:22:21,031 --> 00:22:23,200
Well, I don't know
if this is going to help,

00:22:23,267 --> 00:22:25,069
but the sleeping pills
are zolpidem.

00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,070
Prescription only.

00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:27,471
I thought I'd save you
some time,

00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:28,906
talked to Lockwood.

00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,709
She didn't have a prescription,
but her husband does.

00:22:31,775 --> 00:22:33,577
Thanks, Greg.

00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,481
( <i>rock music blaring</i> )

00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,926
Hey, check this out.

00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,028
The red light camera
clocked her speed

00:22:51,095 --> 00:22:52,596
at 52 miles per hour,
right?

00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,932
Mm-hmm.

00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,767
The computer software

00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,235
pegged her at 60

00:22:58,302 --> 00:23:02,306
by the time she hits
the newspaper dispenser.

00:23:02,373 --> 00:23:04,942
She accelerated
into the building.

00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,645
You already reviewed
the driver's tox screen.

00:23:07,711 --> 00:23:09,713
Now you want
her basic blood panel.

00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,215
I'm running
with a hunch.

00:23:11,282 --> 00:23:12,850
Let's go.

00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,026
SIDLE:
Acetylcholine levels were low,

00:23:22,092 --> 00:23:24,662
epinephrine was high.

00:23:24,728 --> 00:23:26,464
Why are you focused
on those hormones?

00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,898
Kamikaze pilots,
World War II--

00:23:27,965 --> 00:23:29,500
their blood work
was very unusual.

00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:30,935
Acetylcholine levels
were low,

00:23:31,001 --> 00:23:32,503
epinephrine was through
the roof.

00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,739
Well, you're talking about the
sympathetic response to stress--

00:23:35,806 --> 00:23:38,709
eyes dilate, uh, heart rate
goes up, hormones go haywire.

00:23:38,776 --> 00:23:40,277
Diane Lambert lived
two hours away.

00:23:40,344 --> 00:23:41,745
If she drove her car into Vegas

00:23:41,812 --> 00:23:44,048
with the intention of using it
as a murder weapon,

00:23:44,114 --> 00:23:46,016
I imagine she would be
pretty stressed out.

00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:49,220
Kamikaze Granny.

00:23:50,254 --> 00:23:51,655
( <i>door bells jingling</i> )

00:24:10,941 --> 00:24:13,444
Isaac Asimov-- one of
my favorite writers.

00:24:14,478 --> 00:24:16,080
"If knowledge
can create problems,

00:24:16,147 --> 00:24:19,083
then it is not through ignorance
that we will solve them."

00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,051
Is that what you're doing here?

00:24:21,118 --> 00:24:22,553
Solving problems?

00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,222
It's my job to figure out
what happened to your mother.

00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:30,895
Scientists derive satisfaction
from figuring out the puzzle.

00:24:30,961 --> 00:24:34,498
It's about the quest...
not the grail.

00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:39,570
Asimov believed

00:24:39,637 --> 00:24:42,239
that only scientists
could understand the universe.

00:24:42,306 --> 00:24:43,908
His corollary:

00:24:43,974 --> 00:24:46,043
"It's not so much
that I have confidence

00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,411
in scientists
being right..."

00:24:47,478 --> 00:24:49,246
"But that I have
so much confidence

00:24:49,313 --> 00:24:51,248
in non-scientists
being wrong."

00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,885
You a scientist?

00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,520
Yeah.

00:24:56,587 --> 00:24:58,222
I am.

00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:00,692
Peter?

00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:03,428
The boxes won't
unload themselves.

00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:12,337
Peter and I were hoping

00:25:12,404 --> 00:25:13,917
to get back into
the house tonight.

00:25:13,917 --> 00:25:15,385
Well, not tonight, sir.

00:25:15,452 --> 00:25:17,521
It's still an active
crime scene.

00:25:17,587 --> 00:25:21,024
Our lab found zolpidem
in your wife's system--

00:25:21,091 --> 00:25:22,359
20 milligrams.

00:25:22,426 --> 00:25:25,028
That's twice
the recommended dosage.

00:25:25,095 --> 00:25:27,764
Do you know anything
about that?

00:25:27,831 --> 00:25:31,535
Well... Vanessa was having
trouble sleeping.

00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:33,937
The, uh, prescription
is in your name.

00:25:34,004 --> 00:25:35,339
Are you accusing me
of something?

00:25:35,405 --> 00:25:36,707
No.

00:25:36,773 --> 00:25:38,809
We're just telling you
what we know.

00:25:42,346 --> 00:25:45,382
Look, uh... ( <i>sighs</i> )

00:25:45,449 --> 00:25:48,852
ever since this discount chain
opened a branch down the block,

00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:50,854
I've been working
16-hour days

00:25:50,921 --> 00:25:52,456
just trying to survive.

00:25:52,522 --> 00:25:56,627
And I'd go home
and Vanessa would come at me.

00:25:56,693 --> 00:25:57,995
You're always tired.

00:25:58,061 --> 00:25:59,329
You never talk to me.

00:25:59,396 --> 00:26:00,998
Y-You need to
communicate with me.

00:26:01,064 --> 00:26:02,332
You know, I have needs.

00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:03,667
I'm here all day long.

00:26:03,734 --> 00:26:04,935
You never talk to me.

00:26:05,002 --> 00:26:07,404
She'd just go on and on and on
talking.

00:26:07,471 --> 00:26:10,173
And when she'd finally let me
get to sleep,

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,409
she'd want
what every woman wants.

00:26:13,877 --> 00:26:15,579
I-I don't mean
just sex.

00:26:15,646 --> 00:26:17,848
She'd want to talk and talk.

00:26:17,914 --> 00:26:19,549
Next thing you know,
it's 5:00 a.m.,

00:26:19,616 --> 00:26:22,386
the alarm is screaming at me,
and I got to go back to work.

00:26:22,452 --> 00:26:25,856
So you drugged your wife
to get some shut-eye?

00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,692
Yeah.

00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:31,094
I put it in her ice cream.

00:26:31,161 --> 00:26:32,496
I know it
was wrong, but...

00:26:32,562 --> 00:26:33,864
STOKES:
It's also illegal.

00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,232
Yeah.

00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:37,200
Happened as an accident
the first time.

00:26:37,267 --> 00:26:39,169
See, I got a problem
swallowing pills,

00:26:39,236 --> 00:26:41,772
so I crush them up
in the ice cream.

00:26:41,838 --> 00:26:43,674
One night, she grabbed
the wrong bowl

00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,008
and was out like a light.

00:26:45,075 --> 00:26:45,976
Best night's sleep

00:26:46,043 --> 00:26:47,711
I'd had in a long time.

00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,149
Well, if you...

00:26:52,215 --> 00:26:53,650
you got nothing else
you want to ask,

00:26:53,717 --> 00:26:54,718
I got things I got to do.

00:26:54,785 --> 00:26:56,119
I have one more question.

00:26:56,186 --> 00:26:57,587
When did you quit smoking?

00:26:57,654 --> 00:27:00,123
I noticed the, uh,
nicotine patch on your arm.

00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,392
Oh, uh, about three weeks.

00:27:02,459 --> 00:27:03,827
Doctor's orders.

00:27:03,894 --> 00:27:04,995
I got high
blood pressure.

00:27:05,062 --> 00:27:06,430
STOKES:
I have another question.

00:27:06,496 --> 00:27:09,132
Did you know the damper
on your chimney was busted?

00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:10,375
Why, did this have
something to do

00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:11,417
with my wife's death?

00:27:11,417 --> 00:27:13,637
I mean, I asked
Peter if he'd...

00:27:13,704 --> 00:27:16,173
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:18,308
Is this my fault?

00:27:19,876 --> 00:27:21,041
SIDLE:
If the crash was intentional,

00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:22,667
I'm thinking either
the restaurant was the target

00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:24,583
or someone inside
the restaurant.

00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:25,500
I'll call Brass.

00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,101
If Lambert had a grudge
against the place,

00:27:27,168 --> 00:27:28,536
somebody there
should know her.

00:27:28,603 --> 00:27:30,138
If she was gunning
for someone specific,

00:27:30,205 --> 00:27:31,239
there's a lot of variables.

00:27:31,306 --> 00:27:33,374
Maybe we should start
with the most obvious targets--

00:27:33,441 --> 00:27:35,310
the people sitting
in the window.
Let's run it.

00:27:36,811 --> 00:27:39,681
Okay... top to bottom.

00:27:40,682 --> 00:27:42,584
Cameron Black,

00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,319
deceased; from Jersey.

00:27:44,385 --> 00:27:45,954
First time in Vegas.

00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,422
Unlikely mark.

00:27:47,488 --> 00:27:49,924
Second table:

00:27:49,991 --> 00:27:51,993
Rachel Krandall,

00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,595
and...

00:27:53,661 --> 00:27:55,964
Tom Krandall.

00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,265
Both died at the scene.

00:27:57,332 --> 00:27:59,267
Both worked
for Sillmont Healthcare.

00:27:59,334 --> 00:28:00,568
Table three:

00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:02,837
Hank and...

00:28:02,904 --> 00:28:05,773
Elaine Alcott.

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,309
Also works
at the insurance company.

00:28:08,376 --> 00:28:10,345
Three out of five of the people
sitting in the window

00:28:10,411 --> 00:28:11,980
work at
Sillmont Healthcare.

00:28:12,046 --> 00:28:14,349
Maybe I should go talk to her.

00:28:14,415 --> 00:28:15,583
Yeah.

00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,118
Maybe you should.

00:28:17,185 --> 00:28:19,821
ALCOTT:
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>I don't recognize her.</i>

00:28:19,888 --> 00:28:22,624
Well, uh, could she be
one of your policy holders?

00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:23,758
It's possible.

00:28:23,825 --> 00:28:25,426
I oversee hundreds
of members' accounts.

00:28:25,493 --> 00:28:26,594
I can check my list.

00:28:26,661 --> 00:28:27,762
That'd be great.

00:28:29,831 --> 00:28:33,902
I wish I had some more time off,
but with Tom Krandall gone

00:28:33,968 --> 00:28:36,771
and half my department
in the hospital...

00:28:36,838 --> 00:28:39,741
I'm back
at the office tomorrow.

00:28:39,807 --> 00:28:41,776
Let's see...

00:28:41,843 --> 00:28:44,345
Diane Lambert.

00:28:51,686 --> 00:28:53,988
My boyfriend.

00:28:54,055 --> 00:28:55,456
Saved up my miles

00:28:55,523 --> 00:28:57,559
and took him to
Hawaii last year.

00:28:57,625 --> 00:28:59,727
He's going to take me to Tahiti
in a few weeks.

00:28:59,794 --> 00:29:02,564
I can't wait.

00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:05,233
Ms. Lambert isn't on my list.

00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,236
But if you want, I can
go on the company database.

00:29:08,303 --> 00:29:09,571
Thank you.

00:29:09,637 --> 00:29:12,373
Um, I-I have to get back
to the lab.

00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,709
Um, maybe you could call me.

00:29:15,743 --> 00:29:17,645
Okay.

00:29:45,006 --> 00:29:47,342
( <i>water bubbling</i> )

00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:19,741
You're not supposed to be
in here.

00:30:19,807 --> 00:30:22,477
It's my home.

00:30:22,544 --> 00:30:25,680
Well, perhaps you didn't see
the crime scene tape.

00:30:26,714 --> 00:30:29,117
Do I look stupid to you?

00:30:29,183 --> 00:30:30,251
On the contrary.

00:30:30,318 --> 00:30:33,221
I heard you have
an almost perfect 4.0 GPA.

00:30:33,288 --> 00:30:35,924
With the exception
of a B in English.

00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,826
Our detectives do complete
background searches

00:30:38,893 --> 00:30:40,828
on all the principles
at a crime scene.

00:30:40,895 --> 00:30:43,431
I understand you threatened
your English teacher.

00:30:44,465 --> 00:30:48,069
I have to feed my fish.

00:30:50,572 --> 00:30:52,040
Clown loaches,

00:30:52,106 --> 00:30:56,844
tetras, angelfish.

00:30:59,647 --> 00:31:01,616
You might want to check
your filter, too.

00:31:01,683 --> 00:31:03,818
You're out of charcoal.

00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:11,843
GRISSOM:
In 1939, Isaac Asimov

00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:14,278
was an undergraduate
studying zoology.

00:31:14,345 --> 00:31:15,947
As part of
a course requirement,

00:31:16,013 --> 00:31:17,882
the students were asked
to find a stray cat,

00:31:17,949 --> 00:31:19,617
kill it and dissect it.

00:31:19,684 --> 00:31:22,520
Isaac found his cat,
he killed it,

00:31:22,587 --> 00:31:24,555
and then he promptly
dropped out of zoology.

00:31:24,622 --> 00:31:26,257
50 years later,

00:31:26,324 --> 00:31:29,527
he wrote that the memory
of killing that cat
still haunted him.

00:31:29,594 --> 00:31:32,230
Do you have
a question for me?

00:31:32,296 --> 00:31:34,866
Yeah, I do.

00:31:34,932 --> 00:31:37,668
Why didn't you fix the chimney
damper in your parents' bedroom?

00:31:37,735 --> 00:31:38,936
Why would I?

00:31:39,003 --> 00:31:40,705
You told your father
you fixed it.

00:31:40,771 --> 00:31:42,206
So he'd quit
bugging me.

00:31:43,407 --> 00:31:46,444
And if you're accusing me
of disobeying a man

00:31:46,511 --> 00:31:50,147
with only a tenth-grade
education, then you're right.

00:31:50,214 --> 00:31:53,684
We know you took advantage
of the broken damper.

00:31:53,751 --> 00:31:56,454
Placed activated charcoal
from your fish tank filter

00:31:56,521 --> 00:31:58,089
in the back of the fireplace...

00:31:58,155 --> 00:32:00,157
( <i>granules rattling</i> )

00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,431
<i>...then waited for your father</i>
<i>to do what he does every</i>
<i>night.</i>

00:32:07,498 --> 00:32:09,400
You killed your mother.

00:32:09,467 --> 00:32:11,002
You almost killed your father.

00:32:11,068 --> 00:32:13,604
That's good science fiction.

00:32:13,671 --> 00:32:15,072
Well, you thought
the charcoal

00:32:15,139 --> 00:32:17,875
would burn up, destroying
any evidence of the crime,

00:32:17,942 --> 00:32:19,577
but your father woke up,

00:32:19,644 --> 00:32:22,180
called 911.

00:32:25,816 --> 00:32:28,553
Nick, at what point
is the saturation level

00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:31,589
of carbon monoxide in
the bloodstream lethal?

00:32:31,656 --> 00:32:34,659
Approximately 45, 50%.

00:32:34,725 --> 00:32:35,693
Mmm.

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,563
Well, his mother's
level was in the range,

00:32:38,629 --> 00:32:40,665
but his father's
level was low.

00:32:40,731 --> 00:32:41,799
STOKES:
Yeah, but two people

00:32:41,866 --> 00:32:43,634
exposed to the same level
of carbon monoxide

00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:44,802
for the same
period of time,

00:32:44,869 --> 00:32:48,573
their C.O. saturation levels
should be approximate.

00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:50,474
As long as the variables
are consistent--

00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:51,609
body mass, health, age.

00:32:51,676 --> 00:32:53,911
What about smoking?

00:32:53,978 --> 00:32:55,112
Of course.

00:32:55,179 --> 00:32:57,014
STOKES:
Three weeks ago,

00:32:57,081 --> 00:32:59,550
your father quit.

00:33:01,485 --> 00:33:04,021
Yeah, we didn't know
he'd quit, either.

00:33:04,088 --> 00:33:06,624
The nicotine levels
in his system were high

00:33:06,691 --> 00:33:09,260
but when we went
to speak with him,

00:33:09,327 --> 00:33:11,162
he was wearing a nicotine patch.

00:33:11,229 --> 00:33:13,030
STOKES:
The patch
delivers nicotine

00:33:13,097 --> 00:33:14,732
to the blood,

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,201
but since your father
quit smoking cigarettes,

00:33:17,268 --> 00:33:19,570
his C.O. saturation level
returned to zero.

00:33:22,406 --> 00:33:24,375
You made a basic scientific
mistake, Peter.

00:33:24,442 --> 00:33:26,677
You stopped observing
the human element

00:33:26,744 --> 00:33:28,880
because you thought
it was inferior.

00:33:31,516 --> 00:33:34,218
STOKES:
What I don't
understand is why.

00:33:34,285 --> 00:33:37,889
Man, why would you want
to kill your parents?

00:33:37,955 --> 00:33:39,724
Your high school told us

00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:42,159
you were accepted to Princeton,
early action.

00:33:42,226 --> 00:33:43,327
A few more months,

00:33:43,394 --> 00:33:45,563
you would've been
2,000 miles away.

00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:48,199
Whatever your parents
did to piss you off

00:33:48,266 --> 00:33:50,334
wouldn't have mattered.

00:33:53,504 --> 00:33:55,339
I know why.

00:33:57,642 --> 00:34:00,745
They weren't going
to let you go, were they?

00:34:03,814 --> 00:34:05,917
They refused to pay for it.

00:34:05,983 --> 00:34:08,819
I don't qualify
for financial aid

00:34:08,886 --> 00:34:11,923
because my father makes
too much money.

00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:15,393
Not enough money
to live well,

00:34:15,459 --> 00:34:18,596
but enough to destroy my dreams.

00:34:24,368 --> 00:34:26,404
So with your parents gone,

00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:30,374
you could sell the business
and pay your tuition.

00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:35,646
You figured out the puzzle.

00:34:35,713 --> 00:34:37,014
Must be very gratifying.

00:34:37,081 --> 00:34:38,583
GRISSOM:
Science isn't about

00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:41,385
the gratification, Peter.

00:34:41,452 --> 00:34:43,855
It's about the truth.

00:34:46,824 --> 00:34:48,359
Hey.

00:34:48,426 --> 00:34:49,961
Hey.

00:34:54,365 --> 00:34:57,301
So, how did it go
with Elaine Alcott?

00:34:57,368 --> 00:35:00,705
She didn't have anything
to add to the investigation.

00:35:01,706 --> 00:35:02,707
Hey, how's it going?

00:35:02,773 --> 00:35:05,710
Here are the phone records
from the driver of the vehicle

00:35:05,776 --> 00:35:07,445
that you asked for.

00:35:07,512 --> 00:35:10,181
You know, there may be something
to that kamikaze grandma

00:35:10,248 --> 00:35:11,249
theory of yours.

00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:14,886
Last week, Diane Lambert
closed out her bank accounts,

00:35:14,952 --> 00:35:17,722
paid off her credit cards,
and updated her will.

00:35:17,788 --> 00:35:19,524
Well, that's certainly
more evidence

00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,792
to suggest that her actions
were intentional.

00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:25,062
There's only one Vegas
phone number on this statement

00:35:25,129 --> 00:35:26,264
and the prior statement.

00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,799
There's got to be 80 calls
here to the same number.

00:35:28,866 --> 00:35:30,301
Dial the number.

00:35:34,238 --> 00:35:36,174
( <i>keypad beeping</i> )

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,041
( <i>ringing</i> )

00:35:37,108 --> 00:35:39,110
WOMAN:
Sillmont Healthcare.

00:35:39,177 --> 00:35:41,345
How can I direct your call?

00:35:43,214 --> 00:35:44,549
What's your address?

00:35:44,615 --> 00:35:46,984
16 South Meadows Lane.

00:35:47,051 --> 00:35:50,121
Thank you.

00:35:52,089 --> 00:35:55,893
Right. The Checkerbox
is at 16 <i>North</i> Meadows.

00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,261
BRASS:
I don't think

00:35:57,328 --> 00:35:59,230
that's a coincidence.

00:35:59,297 --> 00:36:02,733
If Sillmont Healthcare was
the intended target,

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,503
how did she end up
at the Checkerbox?

00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,004
Well, I'll tell you
what happened to me.

00:36:07,071 --> 00:36:08,005
Last week, I was driving

00:36:08,072 --> 00:36:09,273
to a crime scene in the car

00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,541
and the GPS said go right.

00:36:10,608 --> 00:36:12,977
Had I done so,
I'd be coughing up fish

00:36:13,044 --> 00:36:14,912
from the bottom of Lake Mead.

00:36:14,979 --> 00:36:16,981
Well, GPS is hardly perfect.

00:36:17,048 --> 00:36:19,717
Maybe north was
a directional default.

00:36:19,784 --> 00:36:21,619
Or maybe she put in
the wrong address.

00:36:21,686 --> 00:36:23,287
SIDLE:
Either way...

00:36:23,354 --> 00:36:25,690
it does leave one question:

00:36:25,756 --> 00:36:28,559
Why was Diane Lambert so angry?

00:36:31,929 --> 00:36:34,599
Mrs. Lambert was a member
of our HMO.

00:36:34,665 --> 00:36:36,834
I was, uh, going to call you.

00:36:36,901 --> 00:36:39,770
Well, did she have
some kind of problem

00:36:39,837 --> 00:36:41,539
with her policy?

00:36:41,606 --> 00:36:44,041
MAN:
Not to our knowledge.

00:36:44,108 --> 00:36:46,911
Then you won't mind
if we take a look at her file.

00:36:46,978 --> 00:36:49,780
I'm sorry, member files
are confidential.

00:36:49,847 --> 00:36:51,215
Well, this
member's deceased.

00:36:51,282 --> 00:36:54,185
Not even the doctor-patient
privilege extends postmortem.

00:37:08,432 --> 00:37:10,635
Mrs. Lambert had colon cancer.

00:37:10,701 --> 00:37:13,604
If you read further, you'll see
that it was in remission.

00:37:15,139 --> 00:37:17,008
No, actually,
her most recent CAT scan

00:37:17,074 --> 00:37:18,709
shows recurrence two months ago.

00:37:18,776 --> 00:37:20,077
That's about the same time

00:37:20,144 --> 00:37:22,580
she started calling
your office two times a day.

00:37:22,647 --> 00:37:24,182
Why would she
be calling you?

00:37:26,784 --> 00:37:27,852
You know what?

00:37:27,919 --> 00:37:29,220
Four people are dead.

00:37:29,287 --> 00:37:30,588
Don't waste our time.

00:37:30,655 --> 00:37:32,356
We can take this downtown.

00:37:35,092 --> 00:37:36,494
Mrs. Lambert's oncologist

00:37:36,561 --> 00:37:39,230
recommended immediate
and aggressive treatment.

00:37:39,297 --> 00:37:40,965
Did treatment commence?

00:37:41,032 --> 00:37:42,500
The recommendation was pending.

00:37:42,567 --> 00:37:44,669
Well, what exactly
does that mean?

00:37:44,735 --> 00:37:45,803
Not yet approved,

00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,371
not yet denied.

00:37:49,941 --> 00:37:53,845
In other words,
Mrs. Lambert's health

00:37:53,911 --> 00:37:55,179
was in limbo.

00:37:55,246 --> 00:37:57,048
She wasn't
receiving treatment,

00:37:57,114 --> 00:37:58,916
but she couldn't
file an appeal,

00:37:58,983 --> 00:38:01,118
since you hadn't officially
denied her claim.

00:38:01,185 --> 00:38:04,188
The authorization process
takes... it takes time.

00:38:07,892 --> 00:38:09,760
Time Mrs. Lambert didn't have.

00:38:09,827 --> 00:38:12,496
We have a procedure,
and we follow it.

00:38:12,563 --> 00:38:14,432
( <i>car accelerating</i> )

00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:20,137
And while you were
following your procedure,

00:38:20,204 --> 00:38:22,006
and postponing a decision,

00:38:22,073 --> 00:38:23,574
her cancer cells
were multiplying.

00:38:23,641 --> 00:38:25,109
What were you,
playing the odds?

00:38:25,176 --> 00:38:28,012
Were you hoping she would die
before you had to spend a dime?

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,281
We're not liable here.

00:38:30,348 --> 00:38:32,850
We're not
responsible for

00:38:32,917 --> 00:38:35,119
Mrs. Lambert's actions.

00:38:39,023 --> 00:38:42,560
For what it's worth,
that makes me sick.

00:38:50,968 --> 00:38:52,103
Catherine.

00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,171
Yeah.

00:38:53,237 --> 00:38:54,906
We missed something.

00:38:54,972 --> 00:38:56,541
SIDLE:
Corey, when
I was reviewing

00:38:56,607 --> 00:38:58,776
your grandmother's
insurance policy,

00:38:58,843 --> 00:39:02,046
I noticed she that didn't
specify an e-mail address,

00:39:02,113 --> 00:39:03,648
and that got me thinking.

00:39:03,714 --> 00:39:06,500
Some people her age aren't
technologically savvy.

00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,303
Maybe a GPS device would be
intimidating to her.

00:39:09,369 --> 00:39:12,339
I wondered if she actually
even knew how to use it.

00:39:12,406 --> 00:39:15,809
So I printed the unit and I
found your fingerprints on it.

00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,434
I installed it.

00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,402
SIDLE:
The prints just weren't

00:39:21,468 --> 00:39:22,041
on the base of the unit,
they were on the face.

00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:24,043
You punched in addresses.

00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:25,444
( <i>quiet mumble</i> )

00:39:25,511 --> 00:39:28,213
WILLOWS:
If you were aware of your
grandmother's intentions

00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,716
and programmed the GPS,
you're guilty

00:39:30,783 --> 00:39:34,420
of aiding and abetting
in the murder of three people.

00:39:36,422 --> 00:39:38,991
Oh, God.

00:39:39,058 --> 00:39:41,493
Uh...

00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,163
Last week, she came by my place
'cause she said

00:39:44,229 --> 00:39:46,198
she didn't know how
to work the GPS.

00:39:46,265 --> 00:39:48,167
Okay, Grandma, look,
it's really easy.

00:39:48,233 --> 00:39:49,735
I'll explain it to you again.

00:39:49,802 --> 00:39:53,405
You just type in the address
of where you want to go.

00:39:53,472 --> 00:39:57,876
Look, I swear, if I had known
what she was planning,

00:39:57,943 --> 00:39:59,945
I would've stopped her.

00:40:00,012 --> 00:40:01,547
Uh...

00:40:01,613 --> 00:40:03,082
Well...

00:40:03,148 --> 00:40:05,250
Corey, Homicide has informed us

00:40:05,317 --> 00:40:08,721
that your grandmother
had a life insurance policy,

00:40:08,787 --> 00:40:11,323
in which you're
the sole beneficiary.

00:40:13,092 --> 00:40:16,261
I had no idea.

00:40:16,328 --> 00:40:18,030
She never mentioned it to you?

00:40:18,097 --> 00:40:19,999
No.

00:40:20,065 --> 00:40:23,102
No, no, wait.

00:40:23,168 --> 00:40:25,804
Promise me.

00:40:27,806 --> 00:40:29,608
Okay, fine.

00:40:29,675 --> 00:40:32,711
When I can afford it,
I'll go back to college.

00:40:32,778 --> 00:40:34,880
You should have a degree.

00:40:34,947 --> 00:40:36,815
Grandma, I promise.

00:40:36,882 --> 00:40:38,317
I love you.

00:40:38,384 --> 00:40:41,487
You're such a good boy.

00:40:41,553 --> 00:40:43,589
I love you, too.

00:40:43,656 --> 00:40:45,591
SIDLE:
Your grandmother's
death has been

00:40:45,658 --> 00:40:47,960
ruled a suicide,
which nullifies the policy.

00:40:48,027 --> 00:40:49,795
There's not going
to be any money.

00:40:49,862 --> 00:40:52,164
No...

00:40:52,231 --> 00:40:57,936
Look, I don't think you
understand.

00:40:58,003 --> 00:41:03,509
I loved my grandmother,
and she's dead.

00:41:03,575 --> 00:41:05,811
She killed herself,

00:41:05,878 --> 00:41:09,415
and she killed
these three other people.

00:41:09,481 --> 00:41:11,650
What are you telling me?

00:41:11,717 --> 00:41:14,853
She killed these people for me?

00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,490
And I'm supposed
to live with this?

00:41:31,303 --> 00:41:34,139
I'll meet you at the car.

00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,475
I called the lab.

00:41:36,542 --> 00:41:38,410
They said you were here.

00:41:39,445 --> 00:41:42,314
I heard you met Elaine.

00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:46,051
Yeah, she's really something.

00:41:48,454 --> 00:41:52,057
I didn't tell her about us,
if that's what you're wondering.

00:41:53,759 --> 00:41:56,695
I'm really sorry, Sara.

00:41:56,762 --> 00:41:59,698
Yeah, me, too.

00:41:59,765 --> 00:42:02,001
I don't know what else to say.

00:42:02,067 --> 00:42:06,338
I'll see you around.
