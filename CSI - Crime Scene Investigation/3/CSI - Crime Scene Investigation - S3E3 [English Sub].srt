00:00:14,988 --> 00:00:17,648
Wow, I love it already.

00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,186
I can't believe we're doing this.
Is that the lockbox?

00:00:22,253 --> 00:00:24,255
Broker gave me the combination.

00:00:24,322 --> 00:00:25,523
He's doing a walk-through

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,958
in Seven Hills.

00:00:27,024 --> 00:00:30,127
Owners are out.

00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:44,475
Wow.

00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:46,844
Wait till you see
the master.

00:00:54,185 --> 00:00:56,387
Oh, my God.

00:00:56,454 --> 00:00:58,689
This is gorgeous.

00:00:59,991 --> 00:01:01,092
Amazing.

00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:06,330
What?

00:01:06,397 --> 00:01:08,266
Want to snoop around?

00:01:20,812 --> 00:01:21,913
Hey.

00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:25,149
What do you think?

00:01:25,216 --> 00:01:26,450
I don't know, yeah.
It's nice?

00:01:26,517 --> 00:01:28,252
Looks good.

00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,487
Cut it out.

00:01:29,554 --> 00:01:31,055
No, seriously,
I think I hear a car.

00:01:31,122 --> 00:01:32,857
Will you relax?
No, really.

00:01:32,924 --> 00:01:34,158
You're paranoid.

00:01:37,962 --> 00:01:39,697
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:01:39,764 --> 00:01:41,265
Oh, my God.

00:01:41,332 --> 00:01:42,767
I could get used
to this place.

00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:43,901
I bet you could.

00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:44,969
I could.

00:01:45,036 --> 00:01:46,471
You're an animal.

00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:48,372
The backyard is the best
part of the house.

00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,907
Really? Is there
a Jacuzzi?

00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:57,014
Oh, my God.

00:01:57,081 --> 00:02:00,384
Looks like something
out of a magazine.

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,613
Cal and Monica Newman.

00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:31,082
Owners of the house.
My guess, second marriage.

00:02:31,149 --> 00:02:32,783
'Cause she's a babe
and he's...

00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,318
He's, uh...

00:02:34,385 --> 00:02:35,987
got a good sense of humor.

00:02:44,962 --> 00:02:49,100
.380 auto caliber.

00:02:54,205 --> 00:02:56,007
GRISSOM:
Gunshot, right temple.

00:02:56,073 --> 00:02:58,009
Women don't usually shoot
themselves in the head

00:02:58,075 --> 00:02:59,310
do they, Catherine?

00:02:59,377 --> 00:03:01,145
Well, gunshots do
a number on your face

00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:03,981
so typically women
prefer pills.

00:03:04,048 --> 00:03:06,517
BRASS:
So what are we calling this,
murder, suicide, what?

00:03:06,584 --> 00:03:09,187
Is the husband around?

00:03:09,253 --> 00:03:10,188
No.

00:03:10,254 --> 00:03:12,290
Well, do the math:

00:03:12,356 --> 00:03:13,624
Dead female spouse

00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:15,526
plus missing husband...

00:03:15,593 --> 00:03:17,660
equals murder.

( <i>beeping</i> )

00:04:00,795 --> 00:04:03,798
White female,
multiple bruising...

00:04:03,865 --> 00:04:06,067
Bullet hole to the temple
doesn't help.

00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:09,370
.380 auto on the side.

00:04:09,437 --> 00:04:11,539
Yeah, somebody manhandled her
pretty good

00:04:11,606 --> 00:04:13,941
before they killed her.

00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:35,263
Reminds me
of my daughter.

00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:37,632
She used throw butts
out the window, too.

00:04:37,698 --> 00:04:40,434
The Newmans have kids?

00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:43,204
<i>A</i> kid.
Son, 15, Max Newman.

00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:45,773
He's MIA like the father.

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,908
The secretary said

00:04:46,974 --> 00:04:49,076
he went out for lunch
and never came back.

00:04:49,143 --> 00:04:51,379
I checked the garage--
three cars.

00:04:51,445 --> 00:04:54,115
None of the hoods
are hot.

00:04:54,182 --> 00:04:56,918
We're missing something.

00:04:56,984 --> 00:04:58,619
Grissom.
Mr. Grissom.

00:04:58,686 --> 00:05:01,956
Where would I find
Mr. Grissom?

00:05:02,023 --> 00:05:03,891
Great, great. Thank you
very much. Mr. Grissom?

00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,260
Hi, I'm Augie Heitz.

00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:07,962
This is my listing.

00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:09,897
Someone died, I know.

00:05:09,964 --> 00:05:11,098
It's a terrible thing.

00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:12,800
But we got people
knocking down awnings

00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:14,836
stomping through
the flower beds.

00:05:14,902 --> 00:05:17,071
How am I supposed
to sell this house?

00:05:17,138 --> 00:05:18,439
You're not.

00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:20,274
It's a crime scene.

00:05:20,341 --> 00:05:23,477
Mr. Heitz, you're
Mr. Newman's broker.

00:05:23,544 --> 00:05:25,079
Have you seen
your client lately?

00:05:25,146 --> 00:05:27,081
What, you kidding?

00:05:27,148 --> 00:05:28,249
I mean,
this is actually

00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:30,518
the beauty of the service
I provide.

00:05:30,585 --> 00:05:32,153
My clients never have to see me.

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,022
They don't even have to be home
when I show their house.

00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:36,958
Do you always give
out the combination
to your lockboxes?

00:05:37,024 --> 00:05:38,025
It's illegal.

00:05:38,092 --> 00:05:40,795
It's a hot market.

00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:42,096
Um...

00:05:42,163 --> 00:05:43,865
You know, I had a fish
on the line.

00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:46,267
Potential bidding war.

00:05:46,334 --> 00:05:47,835
Look... ( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:05:47,902 --> 00:05:51,138
I only give out the combination
to people that I really trust.

00:05:55,176 --> 00:05:56,978
All right, look,
I read rooms for a living.

00:05:57,044 --> 00:05:59,814
That closet was tossed.
The carpet lit up.

00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:01,148
So I'm going to ask you again.

00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,885
What were you doing in there
besides copulating?

00:06:05,953 --> 00:06:07,522
It was my idea.

00:06:07,588 --> 00:06:11,225
Right. Well, we found this
laptop on the vanity still on.

00:06:11,292 --> 00:06:13,461
You didn't play
with it, too, did you?

00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:20,334
Hey, Warrick.

00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:21,736
Check this out.

00:06:24,772 --> 00:06:26,841
It's a little thin
for blood, isn't it?

00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:28,943
Yeah.

00:06:31,646 --> 00:06:34,615
What do you...?

00:06:34,682 --> 00:06:37,018
Tastes like sugar water.

00:06:37,084 --> 00:06:38,686
Erythrosine.

00:06:38,753 --> 00:06:40,588
Red dye number three.

00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:41,856
Hummingbirds

00:06:41,923 --> 00:06:43,524
do love the color red.

00:06:43,591 --> 00:06:44,725
You've been watching

00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:46,260
way too much
Discovery Channel.

00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:48,062
This guy needs a girl.

00:06:49,597 --> 00:06:51,432
I'm going to check out
the cabana.

00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:52,800
No visible footprints.

00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:54,936
Doesn't mean someone
wasn't out here.

00:06:55,002 --> 00:06:56,704
Grab the LS.

00:06:56,771 --> 00:06:58,406
Yeah.

00:07:00,374 --> 00:07:01,475
Hey.
Sara.

00:07:03,544 --> 00:07:05,279
I am so sorry.

00:07:05,346 --> 00:07:08,049
I paged you two hours ago.

00:07:08,115 --> 00:07:09,951
Right. Uh, it's my day off.

00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:11,953
I was up in Pahrump
at some vineyard.

00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:13,621
You told me to get a life,
remember?

00:07:13,688 --> 00:07:14,388
Did I?

00:07:17,758 --> 00:07:18,993
I'm sorry, but I needed you.

00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,629
Dispatch called in a 419
at Tuscadero High School.

00:07:21,696 --> 00:07:22,797
You're on your own.

00:07:22,864 --> 00:07:24,832
On my own?

00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:27,268
Solo.

00:07:31,506 --> 00:07:33,541
See you around.

00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,911
Solo?

00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:41,182
So does this mean
when I come in on my day off

00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:42,617
I get to work solo?

00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:44,018
Process.

00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:54,428
Whoa.

00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:58,299
I got what looks like
two sets of prints.

00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:03,004
Ballpark in a size ten

00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,639
from the house.

00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:07,708
And what looks like a...

00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:10,444
size 12, possibly

00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:13,381
from the pool.

00:08:13,447 --> 00:08:16,284
There were definitely
two guys here, Griss.

00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,153
Now we just need to
figure out if one of
them was Mr. Newman.

00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,688
Hey, fellas.

00:08:20,755 --> 00:08:22,557
Looks like the husband
pulled a Clark Kent

00:08:22,623 --> 00:08:24,158
and left all his clothes behind.

00:08:24,225 --> 00:08:26,561
Couldn't have gone far.

00:08:26,627 --> 00:08:28,196
I got his wallet,
credit card

00:08:28,262 --> 00:08:29,730
and keys.

00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:32,366
You hear that?

00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:33,367
What is that?

00:08:33,434 --> 00:08:35,336
Oh, yeah,
it's the pool.

00:08:35,403 --> 00:08:36,871
It's been doing it
all night.

00:08:36,938 --> 00:08:38,472
Sounds like
it's clogged.

00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,608
Did someone
check this pool?

00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:44,111
First officer
said it was clear.

00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:46,280
Does that pool
look clear to you?

00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:49,684
Uh... no.

00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:54,722
One of you guys
is going in.

00:09:03,798 --> 00:09:05,233
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:06,734
I'll go in the pool.

00:09:44,272 --> 00:09:46,040
Oh, man!

00:09:46,107 --> 00:09:48,442
Male D.B.

00:09:55,116 --> 00:09:56,184
You have dinner yet?

00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,719
Yeah. Why?

00:09:58,786 --> 00:10:01,055
You might be
seeing it again.

00:10:04,926 --> 00:10:06,427
Mandy Kirk.

00:10:06,494 --> 00:10:07,428
Seventeen.

00:10:07,495 --> 00:10:08,462
Seventeen.

00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:09,764
Senior.

00:10:09,831 --> 00:10:11,365
Janitor found her.

00:10:11,432 --> 00:10:13,401
Hi, David.
Hey.

00:10:20,608 --> 00:10:22,443
Eviscerated.

00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,778
Maybe a wild animal.

00:10:23,845 --> 00:10:26,747
They picked up a mountain lion
last week in Henderson.

00:10:26,814 --> 00:10:28,616
Suburbs are encroaching
on the hinterlands.

00:10:28,683 --> 00:10:31,786
We'll know more
after the autopsy.

00:10:31,853 --> 00:10:35,389
It's a cheerleader.

00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:37,558
She had to have good lungs.

00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,328
How come nobody
heard her scream?

00:10:49,971 --> 00:10:51,873
Didn't have to do
much of a "Y."

00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:53,140
Attack did it for me.

00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:54,909
Died of exsanguination.

00:10:54,976 --> 00:10:55,910
Bled out.

00:10:55,977 --> 00:10:58,179
Trauma to her
internal organs.

00:10:58,246 --> 00:10:59,247
Spleen, liver, heart

00:10:59,313 --> 00:11:01,516
they all sustained
multiple mastications.

00:11:01,582 --> 00:11:03,317
Hmm.

00:11:03,384 --> 00:11:04,785
You able to isolate the species?

00:11:04,852 --> 00:11:07,054
From the tooth mark
on her left ninth rib.

00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:12,994
Dog maybe?

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,363
Teeth marks are too small
for a mountain cat.

00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:16,531
They're human.

00:11:16,597 --> 00:11:19,167
You're lying.

00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:24,338
You can see the bridgework
on this impression

00:11:24,405 --> 00:11:27,875
of a premolar and
an adjoining molar.

00:11:27,942 --> 00:11:31,913
Can you tell how old
the attacker is?

00:11:31,979 --> 00:11:33,514
Well, I can't give you
the exact age

00:11:33,581 --> 00:11:35,683
but wisdom teeth erupt
between 16 and 30.

00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,552
And there's no evidence
of a wisdom molar

00:11:37,618 --> 00:11:38,786
on this impression.

00:11:38,853 --> 00:11:39,887
Thanks.

00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,758
Oh, one more thing.

00:11:43,825 --> 00:11:45,960
I found an infection
in the mucus

00:11:46,027 --> 00:11:47,428
overlying the
large intestine.

00:11:47,495 --> 00:11:50,164
This girl suffered
from the E-coli bacteria.

00:11:50,231 --> 00:11:52,466
E-coli?

00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:53,835
Unsanitary conditions?

00:11:53,901 --> 00:11:55,403
Or a bad burger.

00:11:55,469 --> 00:12:00,074
So whoever did this to her
also has E-coli.

00:12:00,141 --> 00:12:01,242
Oh, yeah.

00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:04,445
Spiked temp, vomiting,
lower GI problems, the works.

00:12:04,512 --> 00:12:07,515
Smoking gun.

00:12:46,654 --> 00:12:49,657
I mean, I don't get it.

00:12:49,724 --> 00:12:51,492
She's not even
slated to work

00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:52,894
she comes in
on her day off

00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,762
and she gets to work solo.

00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:57,698
You still harping on
the solo thing?

00:12:57,765 --> 00:13:00,301
You know every time
you work with me
you learn something.

00:13:00,368 --> 00:13:03,704
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:13:03,771 --> 00:13:05,606
Is that right?
Yes.

00:13:05,673 --> 00:13:07,842
I live here.
Why can't I go in?

00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:09,510
I want to see my father.

00:13:09,577 --> 00:13:11,312
I'm Cal's ex-wife, Jeri Newman

00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:12,647
and this is our son Max.

00:13:12,713 --> 00:13:14,115
We have the right
to an answer.

00:13:14,182 --> 00:13:16,584
And we have a right
to protect the crime scene.

00:13:16,651 --> 00:13:18,119
What's going on?

00:13:18,186 --> 00:13:21,155
I can't tell you anything
until I get all the details.

00:13:21,222 --> 00:13:22,690
I'm sorry.

00:13:22,757 --> 00:13:23,991
Catherine?

00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:32,300
We need someone
to identify the body.

00:13:32,366 --> 00:13:33,534
Ms. Newman.

00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:35,603
Would you come
with me, please?

00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,104
What about me?

00:13:37,171 --> 00:13:38,172
Uh, no, honey.

00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:40,408
You stay right here.

00:13:43,044 --> 00:13:45,112
No skin separation.

00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:46,814
Minimal gaseous buildup.

00:13:46,881 --> 00:13:48,883
This guy's been in here
under 12 hours.

00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,552
According to his office,
he left work at 1:00.

00:13:51,619 --> 00:13:52,687
It's about right.

00:13:58,192 --> 00:14:00,328
What is that,
some kind of filter?

00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:02,964
It's an anti-vortex filter.

00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,967
Hey, I'm from Jersey,
we swim at the shore.

00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:10,071
It's designed to keep his hand
out of that pipe.

00:14:10,137 --> 00:14:12,607
But it's missing a few screws.

00:14:14,175 --> 00:14:18,713
Ms. Newman, is this
your ex-husband?

00:14:20,314 --> 00:14:21,983
It's Cal.

00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:36,130
Virtual tour.

00:14:36,197 --> 00:14:37,565
Right on, Archie.

00:14:37,632 --> 00:14:41,004
Before and after photos
of the crime scene.

00:14:41,071 --> 00:14:43,920
( <i>imitating Elvis Presley):</i>
Thank you, thank you very much.

00:14:43,986 --> 00:14:45,555
It was on
the hard drive

00:14:45,621 --> 00:14:47,754
of the computer you
got at the crime scene.

00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,123
Looks like
a Peter Croft sculpture.

00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,091
You know your art.
You a collector?

00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,560
What? On my salary?

00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,929
Guggenheim's as close as I get

00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:56,996
to something
like that.

00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,131
Oh, I haven't been yet.

00:14:58,198 --> 00:14:59,365
Really?

00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:02,135
Well, if you want a tour,
I know a docent.

00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:04,137
A docent.

00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:05,972
So, you think
that's legit?

00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,942
House like this, probably
not a knock-off.

00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,243
You'd be surprised.

00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,812
The rich go cheap to stay
rich, know what I mean?

00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,781
Yeah. Let me show you
the after photos.

00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,249
Please.

00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:18,418
Same spot.

00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,119
And, uh, what happened
to the sculpture?

00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,255
Good question.

00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:24,090
You saying somebody lifted it?

00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:26,059
Well, they don't call them
open houses for nothing.

00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,126
Put your house
on the market

00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,529
your privacy's
up for grabs, too.

00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,865
The Newmans
unlocked their door

00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,300
to anybody
with Internet access.

00:15:38,462 --> 00:15:39,713
Soccer bunnies?

00:15:39,713 --> 00:15:41,462
What are soccer bunnies?

00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:43,810
Well, each cheerleader
is assigned a soccer player.

00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:44,811
She's his bunny.

00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:47,614
Gives him gifts the night
before the big game

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,182
places his wake-up call.

00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,183
Sounds sexual.

00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,118
Yeah, that's what
I asked the principal

00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:53,319
but he said no.

00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:54,621
He said that, uh

00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:55,622
it's all good, clean fun.

00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:56,923
Gifts are
inspirational videos

00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,391
like, uh, <i>Rocky</i>

00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,693
and wake-up calls are
pep talks, nothing more.

00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,695
Yeah, well, I'm not
sure the principal's

00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,764
up to speed on teenagers'
sexual habits.

00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,065
Yeah, well, victim Mandy

00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,967
was soccer bunny
to a Chuck Darwell.

00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:09,669
And when I called him
on his cell this morning

00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:12,305
he said that he
hooked up with Mandy

00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,874
after every game
except last night.

00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:16,843
Said he hadn't
seen her last night.

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,545
He in class?
Hospital.

00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,013
Got rushed there
two minutes ago.

00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,853
I bet I know why.

00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:32,072
ROBBINS:
No surprise here.

00:16:32,504 --> 00:16:33,139
He drowned.

00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,662
We found his right hand

00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,530
caught in
a pool filter.

00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,466
Lack of bruising,
no bleeding wounds.

00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:45,238
Indicates his circulatory system
had stopped.

00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,106
This was postmortem.

00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:55,014
Any significance

00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:57,317
to the marks
on his chest?

00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,885
Uh, don't know.
Not a rash.

00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:00,486
Some kind of abrasion.

00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:03,223
Maybe even
a friction burn.

00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,691
Definitely peri-mortem.

00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:05,892
X-rays reveal

00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,460
several broken ribs

00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,597
and he's got a bruise
on his forehead.

00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,632
He could have taken
a bad fall.

00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,601
Or he could have been beaten.

00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,369
Maybe.

00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:17,971
How about the new wife?

00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:22,642
No physical findings
for sexual assault

00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,744
though I did send a kit to DNA.

00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:27,814
Looks like cause of death was
a single gunshot to the head.

00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,048
I'll know more later.

00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:31,384
You always tell me that.

00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:32,619
Yes, I do.

00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,387
Depth of bruising

00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:35,922
gives us a timeline.

00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:37,891
Apparent thumbprint
on her neck came first

00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:41,928
the, uh, prints
on her hands second.

00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:43,730
Major impression on top.

00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,632
It's some kind of

00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:48,501
recoil bruise
on her palm.

00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,504
She didn't shoot herself.

00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,972
( <i>screaming and a gunshot</i> )

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,008
She had help.

00:17:56,309 --> 00:18:00,847
Of course, no house
is complete without a pool.

00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,817
Why live in Vegas
if you don't have a pool?

00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:10,089
Mm, water's warm.

00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:14,093
You want to come by
and take a dip?

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,628
Quite the saleswoman.

00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:20,166
Come on, take a...

00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:23,670
It's got to be
a fantasy of yours, huh?

00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:25,572
Huh, double feature.

00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:29,342
You know you want this.

00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,945
STOKES:
Blam.

00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,613
You can say that again.

00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,681
Blam.

00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,082
Down, boys.

00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:43,723
I probably should even
be saying this, but, uh...

00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:50,330
sex is on my mind all the time.

00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:53,499
Hey, Archie,
freeze it.

00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,468
And, uh...

00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:56,703
Who's that in the background?

00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:57,904
STOKES:
Hmm?

00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:01,241
Oh, that guy in the mirror.
Good.

00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,343
Archie, help us out.

00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,044
Yup, I got him.

00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:06,512
STOKES:
Nice.

00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,585
BRASS:
Hey this is the broker.

00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,320
I just did a background
check on that guy.

00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:17,690
Half a dozen robberies in
the houses he has listed.

00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:19,726
Art, antiques,
stuff like that.

00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,595
Like the Peter Croft sculpture.

00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:23,930
Exactly.

00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,566
STOKES:
Looks like Augie was helping
himself to a little bit

00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,067
more than the artwork.

00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,571
SIDLE:
I understand,
Mr. Darwell.

00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,706
Have your son's wisdom
teeth come in yet?

00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:34,941
What?

00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,342
Whoever killed Amanda Kirk

00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,378
ingested her organs,
Mr. Darwell. Left teeth marks.

00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:40,046
Excuse me.

00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:42,382
Hi, uh, Chuck, I'm with
the crime lab.

00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,884
I'm going to ask you
to show me your back teeth.

00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:47,954
Give us an odontological
impression.

00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,723
I didn't see Mandy
last night, I swear.

00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,191
DARWELL:
You have no legal right

00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:53,726
to question or to touch my son.

00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:54,894
I want you out of here.

00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:56,195
Now.

00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:57,397
Is that stomach contents?

00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,098
That's right, officer.

00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,770
Anything he throw up
no longer belongs to him.

00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:04,971
PD, public domain.

00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,240
It's going to tell us
everything we need to know.

00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:09,676
Look, anyone could have
lifted that Peter Croft.

00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,311
I thought this
was about murder.

00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,312
WILLOWS:
Oh, it is.

00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,379
( <i>cell phone rings</i> )

00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:14,447
Excuse me.

00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:16,082
Yeah?

00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:17,283
Hey, yeah...

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,952
Hey, can I
call you back?

00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:21,087
Okay, then.

00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:22,855
Bye-bye.

00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,591
I'm sorry,
where were we?

00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:25,925
The tape.

00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:29,329
It wasn't anybody's face on
that tape, it was your face.

00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,931
I recorded their house
for the virtual tour.

00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:33,900
That's what I do to sell houses.

00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:35,668
Selling house
as a front for porno

00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,303
a little blackmail
on the side.

00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,504
What are you talking about?

00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:39,672
I have done nothing wrong.

00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,407
Oh, you're innocent in all this?

00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:45,111
I admit to having
lust in my heart.

00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:47,247
Lust doesn't live in your heart.

00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:51,017
I'm going to need
that DNA sample.

00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:53,052
Well, my DNA is your DNA.

00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,754
Great.

00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:56,489
Look, for what it's
worth I can tell you

00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:58,191
at least one guy
other than her husband

00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:00,827
that saw Monica in the buff
on a weekly basis.

00:21:00,894 --> 00:21:01,828
Say, "ah."

00:21:01,895 --> 00:21:02,996
Ah.

00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:05,398
BROWN:
You must get a lot of ass
on a job like this, huh?

00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,634
I'm the pool guy, it's one
of the perks of the job.

00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,935
One minute
I'm scooping leaves

00:21:09,002 --> 00:21:10,136
the next I'm staring at...

00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:11,204
Yeah, I get it.

00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:14,974
The last time
you were there

00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,943
did you happen to see anything
out of the ordinary?

00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,311
What? You mean sexual?

00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:19,846
Maybe.

00:21:19,913 --> 00:21:21,014
No.

00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,348
But, uh...

00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:23,583
Newman had a temper.

00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,318
He and
his kid Max

00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:26,819
were always going at it.

00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:28,821
What are these, huh?

00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:29,856
Where did you get these?!

00:21:29,923 --> 00:21:30,857
I thought the old man

00:21:30,924 --> 00:21:31,991
was going to beat his ass

00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,661
but... Newman just screamed
some more and took off.

00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:37,297
You mind if I take a look
in your cab?

00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:38,364
Sure.

00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,686
Well, that's a coincidence.

00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,621
Newman's anti-vortex filter

00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:03,156
was missing three screws.

00:22:03,223 --> 00:22:04,490
I can explain, okay?

00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:06,826
I remove them screws
from the filter

00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:08,995
so I'd have an excuse
to go back.

00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:10,663
Oh, you mean,
like, a "leave-behind"?

00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,398
Yeah, I figured
the more I was around...

00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:13,466
The more she'd want you.

00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:14,734
Oh, yeah.

00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:17,237
Well, the lab
wants more of you, too.

00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:19,639
We're going to need
your fingerprints

00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:21,040
and a DNA sample.

00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:23,877
Take whatever you want,
I've got nothing to hide.

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,689
GRISSOM:
Anything
from the pool?

00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:39,893
Some hairs,
I may have found a filling.

00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:43,463
Tributlyltin oxide,
aluminum sulfate

00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:44,697
quaternary ammonium.

00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:46,399
Chemicals
in the vic's lungs

00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:48,568
match the chemicals
in the pool water.

00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:50,270
Anything from his head wound?

00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:51,771
Trace matches
the side of the pool.

00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:54,607
No surprises.

00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:58,411
Mildew.

00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:00,113
Hmm?

00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,881
Aureobasidium pullulans.

00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:03,216
One of the very few fungi

00:23:03,283 --> 00:23:05,418
that can withstand
the desert temperature.

00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:07,153
Gives us possible transfer.

00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:11,504
Exactly.
and here's the basic chemistry of the transfer.

00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:14,827
GRISSOM:
<i>Add sugar water</i>
<i>spoiled from the heat</i>

00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:18,531
<i>mix in some human biofilm</i>
<i>you got yourself</i>

00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:21,467
<i>an all-you-can-eat</i>
<i>mildew buffet.</i>

00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:23,036
Cal Newman wore size tens.

00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:25,538
So assuming our killer
wore the size 12...

00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:29,008
He may have transferred mildew
from the pool to the house.

00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:31,544
Normally I don't like
to speak ill of the dead

00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:33,746
but, uh, Mr. Newman's
sperm had company.

00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:34,814
Bad company.

00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:36,082
Look at D7.

00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:37,150
Three alleles.

00:23:37,217 --> 00:23:39,219
Genetics only gives you one

00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:40,320
from each parent.

00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:42,288
Which can only mean
one thing--

00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:43,423
<i>Menage d'allele.</i>

00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,258
She <i>was</i> cheating on her husband.

00:23:45,325 --> 00:23:46,559
What about stutter?

00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:48,161
Percentage is too high.

00:23:48,228 --> 00:23:51,164
We're looking at a minor
and a major sample.

00:23:51,231 --> 00:23:52,398
Minor donor?

00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:53,433
The husband.

00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:54,434
Major donor?

00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,401
Pool man.

00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:56,336
Nope.

00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:57,971
The broker?

00:23:58,037 --> 00:23:58,838
Ibid.

00:23:58,905 --> 00:23:59,906
Major donor

00:23:59,973 --> 00:24:01,207
is still unaccounted for.

00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:10,281
BROWN:
How's it coming?

00:24:10,347 --> 00:24:12,283
STOKES:
Good. I'm almost there.
Hang on.

00:24:12,349 --> 00:24:14,185
Sometime this year.

00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:20,057
Okay, I think that's the angle.

00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:22,393
All right, where do I stand?

00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,095
Back up.

00:24:24,161 --> 00:24:25,162
Keep going.

00:24:25,229 --> 00:24:27,264
Keep going.
Big steps?

00:24:27,331 --> 00:24:28,265
Little steps?

00:24:28,332 --> 00:24:29,333
Big. Keep going.

00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,468
Keep going.

00:24:30,534 --> 00:24:32,436
I go any further,
I'll be in the closet.

00:24:32,503 --> 00:24:34,305
Well, go in the closet.

00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,477
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

00:24:39,543 --> 00:24:40,678
What?

00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:43,714
How's this?

00:24:43,781 --> 00:24:45,850
What the hell is that?

00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:48,619
( <i>scoffs</i> )

00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:51,689
( <i>clattering</i> )

00:24:53,724 --> 00:24:56,260
These slime will do anything
to sell a house, huh?

00:24:56,327 --> 00:24:58,996
JOHNSON:
Sometimes, reflections
beget reflections.

00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:01,966
I figured if I could get
a glimpse of the Augie cutout

00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,535
maybe I could get a glimpse
of the cameraman.

00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:06,937
Check out the lamp.

00:25:23,587 --> 00:25:24,688
Her stepson, Max.

00:25:24,755 --> 00:25:26,624
Did you get
any DNA

00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,125
off the cigarette butts?

00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:30,261
Yeah, we did.

00:25:30,327 --> 00:25:32,997
So, let's get Greg to compare the
reference sample

00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:35,099
and see if we found
our major donor.

00:25:51,015 --> 00:25:54,018
SANDERS:
Driving someone else's
porcelain bus?

00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:57,688
Suspect's dinner
from last night.

00:25:57,755 --> 00:25:58,856
The coroner left this

00:25:58,923 --> 00:25:59,924
in your mail slot.

00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,459
Can you read it for me?

00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,697
What's this
look like, Greg?

00:26:06,764 --> 00:26:07,732
Uh, Caesar salad.

00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:10,634
Oh, and Pele used

00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:12,470
an interesting dressing.

00:26:12,536 --> 00:26:13,804
PCP.

00:26:13,871 --> 00:26:16,073
Angel dust. Hallucinogen.

00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,475
Well, it acts like one.

00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:21,112
But PCP's such a powerful drug
it's in a class all its own:

00:26:21,178 --> 00:26:22,680
Disassociative anesthetic.

00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,048
Brain disassociates
from the body.

00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:25,049
Yeah, after it takes you

00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:26,083
through the paces.

00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,385
How many milligrams?

00:26:27,451 --> 00:26:29,220
Uh... 20.

00:26:29,286 --> 00:26:31,856
Dude's dose was off
the charts.

00:26:31,922 --> 00:26:33,357
I'm surprised
he's still alive.

00:26:33,424 --> 00:26:34,358
Yeah.

00:26:34,425 --> 00:26:37,361
Too bad everybody
didn't make it.

00:26:44,735 --> 00:26:47,271
Tell me this
is raw chicken skin.

00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:54,178
Well, it's raw...
and it's definitely skin.

00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:02,553
My son was nowhere near
that pool.

00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,587
He was at...

00:27:03,654 --> 00:27:04,855
Red Rock Canyon.
A field trip.

00:27:04,922 --> 00:27:06,090
Oh, I'm getting that.

00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:08,492
What I'm not getting
is this.

00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,063
Oh, now, this is disgusting.

00:27:13,197 --> 00:27:15,045
Look, whatever Cal wanted to do

00:27:15,087 --> 00:27:17,134
behind closed doors,
that was his business.

00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:18,369
This is not for my eyes

00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:19,370
or for his eyes.

00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:23,340
This is not the first time,
is it, Max?

00:27:31,682 --> 00:27:33,918
Can I plead the Fifth
or something?

00:27:33,984 --> 00:27:35,052
Max

00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,487
we found two sperm donors

00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:39,123
on the sample
from your stepmother.

00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,125
Your father's and yours.

00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:42,460
Now I know why you were spending

00:27:42,526 --> 00:27:43,928
all that time
at your father's.

00:27:43,994 --> 00:27:45,062
Mom, look, I...

00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:49,934
Mom...

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,802
I don't want to hear
a word from you.

00:27:51,869 --> 00:27:55,427
Well, let me lay it out for you.

00:28:02,046 --> 00:28:04,248
So you must've thought you won
the lottery.

00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:07,418
And the only thing
standing between you
and the winning ticket

00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:08,652
was your father.

00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:10,888
( <i>yelling</i> )

00:28:18,362 --> 00:28:20,765
What's your shoe size, Max?

00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:22,066
Twelve.

00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:24,935
This can't be happening.

00:28:25,002 --> 00:28:26,170
Yes, it's happening.

00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,505
Okay, this is a fling.

00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:28,773
Okay, it's not real.

00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:30,641
You're confused.
You're a kid.

00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,777
I killed my father

00:28:32,843 --> 00:28:34,445
for you.

00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:37,281
That's not possible.

00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,216
How come?

00:28:39,283 --> 00:28:41,452
Because I can't swim.

00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,523
He's telling the truth.

00:28:45,589 --> 00:28:47,625
When Max was a child

00:28:47,691 --> 00:28:50,161
he had this terrible
pool accident.

00:28:50,227 --> 00:28:53,297
He nearly drowned.

00:29:04,508 --> 00:29:06,177
We need that
report, ASAP.

00:29:08,412 --> 00:29:10,247
Your temperature
is spiking.

00:29:10,314 --> 00:29:14,485
Of course, you didn't
know Mandy had E. coli

00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:16,887
when you... ate her,
did you?

00:29:16,954 --> 00:29:18,322
No, no, I would never do that.

00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:20,091
You would on PCP.

00:29:21,692 --> 00:29:23,828
Normal brain, neurons
send a message

00:29:23,894 --> 00:29:25,863
<i>synapses blink on and off.</i>

00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,533
On PCP, synapses
never stop firing.

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,703
<i>Like your entire brain</i>
<i>is on constant DSL.</i>

00:29:34,045 --> 00:29:35,539
LOCKWOOD:
You and Mandy

00:29:35,606 --> 00:29:37,074
were on the soccer field.

00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:38,809
You were cranked up.

00:29:38,876 --> 00:29:40,611
Do you remember
anything?

00:29:46,283 --> 00:29:48,452
Yeah.

00:29:49,653 --> 00:29:52,022
But I don't remember
killing her. I swear to God.

00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:54,492
Lieutenant Lockwood's
going to arrest you.

00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:57,795
We'll assign you
an advocate.

00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,233
GRISSOM:
So, how does a kid who can't
swim drown his father?

00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:03,300
The kid didn't do it.

00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:04,735
Look, we found
the father's blood

00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:06,370
on the underside
of the pool ledge.

00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,005
And his body at the bottom
of the pool

00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:09,306
with abrasions
on his chest.

00:30:10,808 --> 00:30:12,309
So there was a struggle
in the water.

00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,145
With someone
who can swim.

00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:15,679
Right.

00:30:21,629 --> 00:30:24,337
You cannot be serious!

00:30:24,404 --> 00:30:27,073
Hey, John McEnroe,
where's the game?

00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,508
All the prints
are accounted for

00:30:28,575 --> 00:30:30,944
by people who had a reason
to be in the Newman house

00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:33,179
all the way down to the vortex
cover, <i>Warrick.</i>

00:30:33,246 --> 00:30:34,714
Prints came back
to the pool boy.

00:30:34,781 --> 00:30:37,484
Yeah. Yeah, so all I've got

00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,452
is an errant blond hair

00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:43,156
a tooth filling and some
detritus from the bottom
of the pool.

00:30:43,223 --> 00:30:46,259
All right, now, don't get
your panties in a bunch.

00:30:46,326 --> 00:30:51,231
Uh, so we got the blond hair,
the tooth filling...

00:30:51,297 --> 00:30:52,699
That's it, huh?

00:30:52,766 --> 00:30:53,700
Yeah.

00:30:53,767 --> 00:30:56,636
I mean, I did identify
some Neoprene

00:30:56,703 --> 00:30:58,705
and it was white.

00:30:58,772 --> 00:30:59,672
White Neoprene.

00:30:59,739 --> 00:31:00,707
Yeah.

00:31:00,774 --> 00:31:02,409
Like in a wet suit
Neoprene?

00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,345
Was the vic a diver?

00:31:05,412 --> 00:31:06,646
Not that I know of.

00:31:06,713 --> 00:31:09,115
The son can't even swim.

00:31:09,182 --> 00:31:10,617
Let's think about that.

00:31:10,683 --> 00:31:15,221
Who wears a white wet suit
in a pool?

00:31:15,288 --> 00:31:17,524
Scuba diver.

00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,892
Or a professional.

00:31:18,958 --> 00:31:21,795
A professional.

00:31:21,861 --> 00:31:24,864
No, I mean like
a hired gun professional.

00:31:24,931 --> 00:31:27,167
Yeah.

00:31:35,608 --> 00:31:36,976
Tooth hurt?

00:31:38,645 --> 00:31:43,483
You might, uh, need your filling

00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:46,086
which we found
at the bottom
of the Newmans' pool.

00:31:46,152 --> 00:31:48,521
BRASS:
We also found
your fingerprints

00:31:48,588 --> 00:31:50,190
and your hair.

00:31:50,256 --> 00:31:54,127
Look, I'm sure
you'll find me all
over the house.

00:31:54,194 --> 00:31:55,895
I wanted to buy it.

00:31:55,962 --> 00:31:57,097
I was everywhere.

00:31:57,163 --> 00:32:00,767
Well, you made sure you were
everywhere, too, didn't you?

00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:04,270
I wanted to thoroughly
inspect the property.

00:32:04,337 --> 00:32:05,438
<i>Caveat emptor,</i> right?

00:32:05,505 --> 00:32:08,408
Or <i>caveat venditor.</i>

00:32:08,475 --> 00:32:09,943
Let the seller beware.

00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:12,445
Your prints
came back military.

00:32:12,512 --> 00:32:13,680
Navy Seal.

00:32:13,747 --> 00:32:15,081
Ex-Navy Seal.

00:32:15,148 --> 00:32:16,449
Oh, yeah, that's right.

00:32:16,516 --> 00:32:19,686
You rang the bell.

00:32:22,589 --> 00:32:24,791
You had the physical tools
for the training

00:32:24,858 --> 00:32:26,025
but not the character.

00:32:26,092 --> 00:32:28,361
And if you had anything
more than a filling

00:32:28,428 --> 00:32:30,363
and a piece
of Neoprene

00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,165
we wouldn't be here.

00:32:32,232 --> 00:32:33,366
Berglund.

00:32:33,433 --> 00:32:36,970
That's a Scandinavian name,
isn't it?

00:32:37,036 --> 00:32:39,005
That's what
my parents tell me.

00:33:02,796 --> 00:33:04,064
Hey, heard you nailed

00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,632
soccer boy
for the murder.

00:33:05,698 --> 00:33:06,733
Not exactly.

00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,734
No match

00:33:07,801 --> 00:33:09,135
on the bite plate.

00:33:09,202 --> 00:33:11,638
Well, maybe there was someone
else with them.

00:33:11,704 --> 00:33:14,107
Someone getting sicker
by the minute.

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,248
Greg.

00:33:22,315 --> 00:33:23,850
Yeah?

00:33:23,917 --> 00:33:25,418
I need you to take off
your shoes and socks.

00:33:25,485 --> 00:33:29,989
See, now we're getting into this
whole strip forensics thing

00:33:30,056 --> 00:33:31,925
and I'm not so sure
I can hang with that

00:33:31,991 --> 00:33:33,593
even if you are my boss.

00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,629
Your mother's maiden name
is Hojem, correct?

00:33:36,696 --> 00:33:37,931
Hojem is Norwegian?

00:33:37,997 --> 00:33:39,065
Yeah.

00:33:39,132 --> 00:33:41,267
And you know, my grandfather
got tossed from Norway

00:33:41,334 --> 00:33:42,769
for getting my grandmother
pregnant

00:33:42,836 --> 00:33:43,837
before they got married.

00:33:43,903 --> 00:33:45,939
To this day,
he still tells me

00:33:46,005 --> 00:33:48,408
<i>"Som man reder sa ligger man."</i>

00:33:52,512 --> 00:33:54,347
One must lie in the bed
one has made.

00:33:54,414 --> 00:33:56,015
That's true.

00:33:56,082 --> 00:33:57,917
Right foot first, please.

00:34:00,086 --> 00:34:01,521
Now, you're sure you want
me to do this?

00:34:01,588 --> 00:34:03,556
Things could get loud
in here.

00:34:08,194 --> 00:34:09,295
Left foot.

00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,300
So you want
to tell me

00:34:14,367 --> 00:34:15,535
why we're doing this?

00:34:17,837 --> 00:34:19,606
It's an experiment.

00:34:20,573 --> 00:34:21,508
Put these on.

00:34:21,574 --> 00:34:23,810
Come see me in six hours.

00:34:34,254 --> 00:34:35,722
Nicole Exmoor, 18.

00:34:35,789 --> 00:34:37,754
School nurse said
she couldn't stop
throwing up.

00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,671
Teacher found
her passed out
in the locker room.

00:34:39,671 --> 00:34:40,660
She have an
explanation?

00:34:40,727 --> 00:34:42,095
Said that she
ate something

00:34:42,162 --> 00:34:43,563
that didn't
agree with her.

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,733
Nicole, do you know
what E. coli is?

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,769
Your friend Mandy
was infected with it.

00:34:49,836 --> 00:34:52,172
We think we know
how you got it.

00:34:52,238 --> 00:34:53,907
We can test
your blood for PCP...

00:34:53,973 --> 00:34:56,843
( <i>sniffling</i> ):
Chuck brought the weed,
not me.

00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:59,813
This guy told him
it was a really great high.

00:35:01,548 --> 00:35:04,751
These photographs are...

00:35:04,818 --> 00:35:07,120
of Mandy's ribs.

00:35:07,187 --> 00:35:09,089
We believe these
are your teeth marks.

00:35:13,827 --> 00:35:15,128
Ms. Sidle can make

00:35:15,195 --> 00:35:17,097
an impression
of your teeth

00:35:17,163 --> 00:35:18,832
or you can
help yourself

00:35:18,898 --> 00:35:20,834
and explain
what happened.

00:35:24,871 --> 00:35:27,240
When Jack and I went
to the field...

00:35:27,307 --> 00:35:28,541
we were hooking up

00:35:28,608 --> 00:35:30,610
<i>behind Mandy's back.</i>

00:35:33,337 --> 00:35:35,315
<i>She showed up, she was like,</i>

00:35:35,382 --> 00:35:37,450
<i>"He's my player."</i>

00:35:37,517 --> 00:35:38,952
Mandy!

00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:41,629
<i>I don't know what happened.</i>
<i>I started to feel weird</i>

00:35:41,629 --> 00:35:44,860
<i>like my blood</i>
<i>was surging through me.</i>

00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,330
It didn't make any sense.

00:35:53,566 --> 00:35:56,603
I think I wanted to be her.

00:36:04,711 --> 00:36:06,413
It felt...

00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:09,883
It felt like somebody else
walked over and did it.

00:36:09,949 --> 00:36:12,185
Like she was split
from my body.

00:36:17,657 --> 00:36:21,828
It's called
psychological detachment.

00:36:21,895 --> 00:36:23,396
It's a function
of PCP.

00:36:43,183 --> 00:36:46,486
It's like out
of a really bad dream.

00:36:46,553 --> 00:36:49,589
Nicole, I was at
Mandy's autopsy.

00:36:49,656 --> 00:36:52,258
It was not a dream.

00:37:03,603 --> 00:37:06,539
I'm placing you
under arrest

00:37:06,606 --> 00:37:08,641
for the murder
of Amanda Kirk.

00:37:11,344 --> 00:37:13,413
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:19,919
What's going to happen to me?

00:37:21,087 --> 00:37:23,556
That's up to the D.A.

00:37:32,632 --> 00:37:35,004
Hey, Cyrus, next time
somebody says

00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:37,087
experimenting with
drugs is harmless

00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,706
remind me of this.

00:37:46,813 --> 00:37:49,349
What did you do to me?

00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:51,651
You had a reaction.

00:37:51,718 --> 00:37:54,020
I'm Hazmat meat.

00:37:54,087 --> 00:37:56,322
Quarantine,
here I come.

00:37:57,296 --> 00:37:59,059
Your right foot,
I swabbed

00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:01,428
with a placebo,
regular tap water.

00:38:01,494 --> 00:38:03,296
Yeah, well, I'm not worried
about the right foot.

00:38:03,296 --> 00:38:06,433
Left foot...
eumycotic dermatitis.

00:38:06,499 --> 00:38:07,667
Oh, great.

00:38:07,734 --> 00:38:09,469
It's probably fatal.

00:38:09,536 --> 00:38:11,638
It's a mildew-induced
skin rash.

00:38:11,704 --> 00:38:15,642
You infected me with mildew?

00:38:19,345 --> 00:38:20,814
Here. Hydrocortisone.

00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,850
Follow the directions,
clear it right up.

00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:29,522
It's called
Aureobasidium pullulans.

00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:32,959
Is that supposed
to mean something to me?

00:38:34,004 --> 00:38:35,762
It may.

00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:38,231
This is a warrant.

00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:42,001
To see my feet?

00:38:42,068 --> 00:38:44,070
Yes, both of them.

00:38:44,137 --> 00:38:46,039
Take off your shoes
and socks, please.

00:38:47,941 --> 00:38:50,176
Aureobasidium pullulans
is a mildew.

00:38:50,243 --> 00:38:52,545
We found it around
the Newmans' pool.

00:38:52,612 --> 00:38:54,247
It induces rashes
in people

00:38:54,314 --> 00:38:55,915
of Scandinavian descent--

00:38:55,982 --> 00:38:58,685
and it does so in
a predictable progression

00:38:58,752 --> 00:38:59,819
which provides us

00:38:59,886 --> 00:39:01,888
with a valuable
timeline.

00:39:06,626 --> 00:39:07,761
You have the rash.

00:39:12,532 --> 00:39:14,067
And size 12 feet.

00:39:22,876 --> 00:39:25,278
Let me tell you
how you did this.

00:39:41,895 --> 00:39:43,563
( <i>gasping</i> )

00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,529
And then you went upstairs.

00:40:16,596 --> 00:40:17,430
Cal?

00:40:17,497 --> 00:40:19,032
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,969
You're still
going to have to
convince a jury

00:40:23,036 --> 00:40:24,270
that I killed
two strangers

00:40:24,337 --> 00:40:25,739
for no reason.

00:40:29,476 --> 00:40:32,612
You ever been to the theater,
Peter?

00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:35,582
There's a play called
<i>Six Degrees of Separation.</i>

00:40:35,648 --> 00:40:37,650
It's about how all the people
in the world

00:40:37,717 --> 00:40:40,420
are connected to each other
by no more than six people.

00:40:40,487 --> 00:40:42,989
All it takes
to connect you
to the victims

00:40:43,056 --> 00:40:45,024
is one degree.

00:40:49,162 --> 00:40:51,965
Peter Berglund?

00:40:52,031 --> 00:40:54,367
No, I don't recall
ever having met

00:40:54,434 --> 00:40:55,735
somebody
by that name.

00:40:55,802 --> 00:40:58,304
Well, do you recall
living in San Diego?

00:40:58,371 --> 00:41:01,041
What does that have
to do with anything?

00:41:01,107 --> 00:41:02,776
Oh, it just might
help jog your memory.

00:41:02,842 --> 00:41:04,044
San Diego's
a military town.

00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:06,079
Your sister
married a guy in
the Navy, right?

00:41:06,146 --> 00:41:08,248
Did you really bring me in here
just for this?

00:41:08,314 --> 00:41:10,250
Well, we could go
someplace else

00:41:10,316 --> 00:41:11,818
if you'd like.

00:41:11,885 --> 00:41:14,587
How about your house?

00:41:14,654 --> 00:41:16,623
The one you're selling.

00:41:16,689 --> 00:41:18,091
What's this?

00:41:18,158 --> 00:41:19,826
Well, you see,
we didn't have

00:41:19,893 --> 00:41:22,337
enough evidence at this point
to get a warrant

00:41:22,337 --> 00:41:25,265
but you put your house
on the Internet.

00:41:25,331 --> 00:41:27,500
I didn't need
a warrant.

00:41:27,567 --> 00:41:29,769
Gave me
complete access

00:41:29,836 --> 00:41:32,505
via this
virtual tour.

00:41:32,572 --> 00:41:35,308
And all with
your permission.

00:41:42,015 --> 00:41:45,985
That's you...
that's Peter Berglund...

00:41:46,052 --> 00:41:47,987
and that's the Pacific.

00:41:48,054 --> 00:41:49,422
So what?

00:41:49,489 --> 00:41:51,124
I know Peter.

00:41:51,191 --> 00:41:53,593
Yeah.

00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,596
You hired him to kill your ex-husband

00:41:56,663 --> 00:41:57,897
and his
new wife.

00:41:57,964 --> 00:41:59,666
The picture doesn't
prove anything.

00:41:59,733 --> 00:42:01,434
No, but it did
give me access

00:42:01,501 --> 00:42:03,536
to Peter's
financial information.

00:42:06,339 --> 00:42:08,341
Loan application.
Two signatures--

00:42:08,408 --> 00:42:10,510
Peter Berglund
and yours.

00:42:10,577 --> 00:42:11,578
You cosigned for Peter

00:42:11,644 --> 00:42:13,480
because he couldn't qualify
on his own.

00:42:13,546 --> 00:42:15,048
Payment for the hit.

00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,383
He gets
your house

00:42:16,449 --> 00:42:18,818
you get your
ex-husband's money.

00:42:18,885 --> 00:42:21,121
The thing about
murder for hire...

00:42:21,187 --> 00:42:23,223
there's always a paper trail.

00:42:31,531 --> 00:42:33,900
Good night.

00:42:34,934 --> 00:42:36,736
Good night, Sara.

00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:40,907
Hey.

00:42:42,909 --> 00:42:45,111
Nice work on
the high school case.

00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:49,916
I'm, uh...

00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:53,453
...sorry I missed your page.

00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,389
It's just, um...

00:42:56,456 --> 00:42:57,891
you tell me to get a life

00:42:57,957 --> 00:43:00,760
and then I get
one, and...

00:43:00,827 --> 00:43:04,464
then you expect me to be there
at a moment's notice.

00:43:04,531 --> 00:43:08,087
It's, um, confusing.
