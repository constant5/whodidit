of them.

And bringing them to Vegas
for target practice.

What's it
highlighted for?

00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,562
It's a Riviera necklace.

00:09:13,628 --> 00:09:15,597
We loaned it to a couple
for the fight

00:09:15,664 --> 00:09:17,365
and they refuse
to return it

00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,400
until we return
the ring

00:09:18,466 --> 00:09:19,901
that they brought
in for cleaning.

00:09:19,968 --> 00:09:22,771
Which was stolen along
with the other items, right?

00:09:22,837 --> 00:09:24,439
Exactly--
and they won't leave

00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:26,174
until we get this
sorted out.

00:09:26,241 --> 00:09:27,909
Can you help me out here?

00:09:27,976 --> 00:09:30,445
Sorry, mediation's
not really my thing.

00:09:30,512 --> 00:09:31,913

00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,481
Mm-hmm.

00:09:37,886 --> 00:09:40,222

I'm at a smash and grab.

00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,224
Lots of glass, a little blood.

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,559
Do me a favor:
Check the local hospitals.

00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,027
Anyone comes in with

00:09:46,094 --> 00:09:48,396
a forearm laceration,
it could be our guy.

00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,532
Thanks, man.

00:09:53,602 --> 00:09:56,037
I promoted this
match, Mr. Grissom.

00:09:56,104 --> 00:09:58,673
I spent 16 months
of my life stroking

00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,011
fighters, managers, handlers,
and kissing a whole lot of ass

00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:05,313
that never got past junior high

00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,383
and I resent
the implication

00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,686
that the fight was fixed,
or that Laroi Steele's death

00:10:11,753 --> 00:10:13,755
was anything
other than a tragedy.

00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,490
These photographs are from...?

00:10:15,557 --> 00:10:17,826
The last
Steele-Molina fight.

00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:19,394
What, does he use them
for motivation?

00:10:19,461 --> 00:10:20,395
And for show.

00:10:20,462 --> 00:10:21,663
Boxing is theater.

00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,931
Well, according to

00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:25,300
your poster, this fight
was about revenge.

00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:26,301
Boxers fight

00:10:26,368 --> 00:10:27,302
for money.

00:10:27,369 --> 00:10:28,803
The rest of it is just hype.

00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:32,107
These Mr. Molina's?

00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,542
Yeah.

00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:34,943
From tonight's fight?

00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:35,944
Yeah.

00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,312
Technically,
after a fight

00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:38,813
those gloves
become property

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,182
of the Boxing Commission.

00:10:40,248 --> 00:10:42,450
Right now, they're evidence,
so they belong to me.

00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,152
What do you think
you're going to find

00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:45,387
on those gloves--
liniment?

00:10:45,453 --> 00:10:48,223
Like Sonny Liston used
to blind Cassius Clay?

00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,125
The sport has come a long way

00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:51,159
since then.

00:10:51,226 --> 00:10:53,995
It's still
two skulls and four fists.

00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:55,964
It hasn't come that far.

00:10:58,266 --> 00:11:01,770
What did you find?

00:11:01,836 --> 00:11:03,939
GRISSOM:
What appears to be

00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:07,142
a unique metal: mercury.

00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,845
Like in a
thermometer?

00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:12,647
Amongst other things.

00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,120
Looks like
it was fight night

00:11:19,187 --> 00:11:20,121
for a lot of people.

00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:21,156
It sure does.

00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,490
And some guys
get paid

00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,627
a million bucks
for it.

00:11:25,694 --> 00:11:29,497
Sorry to keep you waiting, but,
uh, Commission rules, you know?

00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,867
Before and
after a fight.

00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:34,603
Boxing and drugs
don't mix, you know?

00:11:38,506 --> 00:11:41,276
All yours.

00:11:43,512 --> 00:11:45,447
So... <i>Â¿que onda?</i>

00:11:45,514 --> 00:11:49,017
What's the crime lab
want with me?

00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,287
Well, for starters,
we need to see your hands.

00:11:52,354 --> 00:11:53,822
Why?

00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:55,724
Is that a "no"?

00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,093
No.

00:12:02,664 --> 00:12:04,332
One more.

00:12:08,837 --> 00:12:11,139
Now, who do you think
you're looking at--

00:12:11,206 --> 00:12:12,574
Felix Trinidad?

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,385
Who is that?

00:12:15,452 --> 00:12:16,887
Felix Trinidad
is a fighter

00:12:16,954 --> 00:12:19,223
who was once accused
of dipping his wraps

00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:21,834
in ice water
before a fight.

00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:24,504
It turns the tape and gauze
into a hardened cast.

00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,372
It's like punching
with concrete.

00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:29,375
And it also shreds your hands.

00:12:29,442 --> 00:12:30,910
Mine are clean.

00:12:30,977 --> 00:12:32,578
A fighter's lost his life.

00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:34,013
We're just making sure

00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,215
that there was
no unfair advantage.

00:12:36,282 --> 00:12:38,251
All I did was out-punch Laroi.

00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:41,554
Okay, you think I wanted it
to go down like this?

00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:44,257
I mean, people are going
to remember me now

00:12:44,323 --> 00:12:46,250
like Ray Mancini
when he killed that Korean guy.

00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,918
That's my legacy now.

00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,143
Ah, this wasn't my fault,
all right?

00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,179
He brought it upon himself
talking all that trash

00:12:55,246 --> 00:12:57,081
saying I could never beat him.

00:12:57,148 --> 00:12:59,751
Look...

00:12:59,817 --> 00:13:02,186
he should have never came out
in the seventh round.

00:13:02,253 --> 00:13:04,122
He could barely
stand up.

00:13:04,188 --> 00:13:06,691
I knew it was over right then.

00:13:06,758 --> 00:13:08,426
So why did you keep hitting him?

00:13:08,493 --> 00:13:09,527
Because
real fighters

00:13:09,594 --> 00:13:10,695
don't stop hitting

00:13:10,762 --> 00:13:13,031
until somebody makes them,
all right?

00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:16,668
When you're in the ring,
your life's in the ref's hands.

00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:26,620
Now, one word from that ref,
and I would have stopped.

00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,792
<i>But he never gave the word.</i>

00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:45,126
How we doing, Bobby?

00:13:45,193 --> 00:13:46,628
Hey. Well, good news.

00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:49,064
All the bullets
pulled from the vic

00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,165
are from the same gun.

00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:52,600
Six right, .380.

00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:53,602
The bad news?

00:13:53,668 --> 00:13:54,636
We're 0 for two

00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:56,838
matching the bullets
to the guns y'all recovered.

00:13:56,905 --> 00:13:58,440
I did find something,
though

00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:01,009
on one of them shells,
if you want to take a look.

00:14:01,076 --> 00:14:03,078
It's set up for you
over there.

00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,616
Could be biological.

00:14:07,682 --> 00:14:09,484
I'll send it to trace.

00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:11,486
Well, I hope
it gets you somewhere

00:14:11,553 --> 00:14:13,855
'cause all we got here
is strike three.

00:14:13,922 --> 00:14:15,457
BROWN:
Brass, Brown.

00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:18,727
I need as much information as
you can give me on a referee.

00:14:18,793 --> 00:14:19,995
Hey, Sara.

00:14:20,061 --> 00:14:21,162
Hey.

00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,959
I'll be right there.

00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:26,668
I have something
to show you.

00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:29,237
We gave Molina a ride in.

00:14:29,304 --> 00:14:30,272
You did?

00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:31,273
He didn't say much

00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:33,208
which is no big
surprise, considering.

00:14:33,275 --> 00:14:34,509
There's not much in here

00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:35,708
but, uh, I know
how you like to
see everything.

00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,910
Thanks.

00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,047
We checked vitals,
cleaned his lacerations

00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,349
and he wanted

00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,751
his hand wraps cut off,
so we cut them off.

00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,319
Is this it?

00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,387
Right.

00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,193
He autographed it.

00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,061
Nah, that's
the inspector's signature.

00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:57,530
Whoever watched him wrap up.

00:14:57,596 --> 00:15:00,399
It looks like there's some kind
of metal in the gauze.

00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:03,936
Mercury, maybe?

00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,972
No, there's no mercury
in any of our instruments.

00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,307
We're fully digital.

00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:09,975
How do you think
it got there?

00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,210
I don't know.

00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:14,813
Massive soft tissue damage,
severe facial fractures.

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,449
Are they letting guys
go at each other

00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,018
with clubs these days?

00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,819
Only on cable.

00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,189
It never ceases
to amaze me

00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,258
the damage one human being
can inflict on another.

00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,994
Or how much damage a
human body can sustain.

00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,829
A heavyweight
can land a punch

00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,798
at 1,000 pounds
per square inch.

00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,900
<i>The energy of the punch</i>
<i>is transferred</i>

00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,735
<i>through the</i>
<i>cerebrospinal fluid</i>

00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,938
<i>compressing the brain</i>
<i>against the skull</i>

00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:41,106
<i>temporarily disrupting</i>
<i>neural activity.</i>

00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,308
<i>Like a short circuit.</i>

00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:43,909
<i>Too many short circuits</i>

00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,611
<i>and the brain shuts down.</i>

00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,847
And hence, a knockout.

00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:51,383
This guy should
have been so lucky.

00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,252
This, uh, bruising

00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,087
under the chin
seems heavy.

00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,222
Yeah, I thought so, too.

00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,690
I did a postmortem angiogram.

00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,061
It's a basilar
subarachnoid hematoma

00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,662
the result of a massive

00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,198
<i>vertical blunt force trauma</i>
<i>to the chin.</i>

00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,133
<i>The sudden forced rotation</i>
<i>of the neck</i>

00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,035
tears the vertebral artery

00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,973
and blood pours out into
the surrounding soft tissue.

00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,141
It's called an uppercut.

00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,010
♪ You say tomato... ♪

00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,479
and I say "cause of death."

00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:24,283
Gil, I never had you pegged
as a fight fan.

00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,284
I'm not, really.

00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,052
My first year as a criminalist

00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,321
I thought boxing
would be a good place

00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,156
to observe live blood spatter.

00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,992
So, I went to a
couple of bouts.

00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,627
There wasn't much spatter.

00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:37,296
Some interesting bruise
formations, though.

00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,165
So, uh,
this is a socially acceptable

00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:40,833
live-subject laboratory for you?

00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,836
Yeah. Not in this case.

00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,378
Thank you.

00:16:48,444 --> 00:16:49,379
Preliminary tox?

00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:50,480
Yeah.

00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:54,317
Professional athlete.

00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:55,451
Would have expected

00:16:55,518 --> 00:16:58,755
performance enhancers--
uh, creatine, dianobol.

00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:01,758
This man had sufentanil
in his system.

00:17:01,824 --> 00:17:03,726
Sufentanil? A sedative?

00:17:03,793 --> 00:17:05,762
Yeah.

00:17:05,828 --> 00:17:07,931
So, if the fighter
won't take a dive...

00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,935
help him take a dive.

00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,736
What's my cousin
got to do with the fight?

00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,004
Your cousin bet 20
large on Javier Molina

00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,339
at five-to-one against.

00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,108
Hey, he's always been
a lucky guy.

00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,500
Yeah, I know,
I'm sure he is.

00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,001
Well, you know
how this works.

00:17:26,068 --> 00:17:27,803
I mean, you hear
the fight's fixed

00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,406
you tip off your cousin
for a piece of the action

00:17:30,472 --> 00:17:32,675
he tells a couple of
friends, so on, so on.

00:17:32,741 --> 00:17:35,711
They make a bet at
the last minute, and
the odds go south.

00:17:35,778 --> 00:17:37,580
Hey, big fight,
money moves around.

00:17:37,646 --> 00:17:38,781
Oh, yeah, that's cool.

00:17:38,847 --> 00:17:40,249
This is Vegas.
Money flows.

00:17:40,316 --> 00:17:42,384
As long as it doesn't
flow out of your pocket.

00:17:42,451 --> 00:17:46,055
Maybe that's why you let
the fight go on so long.

00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:47,823
Yeah, you see a
fighter in trouble

00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,391
you give him
a standing eight.

00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,460
If he comes out a winner,
you're in the poorhouse.

00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:53,863
So, what are you saying,
that if I'd stopped the fight

00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:55,431
Laroi Steele
would still be alive?

00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,801
You charging me
with something?

00:17:58,868 --> 00:18:01,570
No. Not yet.

00:18:01,637 --> 00:18:04,773
You know where to find me.

00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,642
Randy Watkins.

00:18:06,709 --> 00:18:08,477
I'm Detective
O'Riley.

00:18:08,544 --> 00:18:10,312
This is Nick Stokes
of the crime lab.

00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:11,914
Hi, there.
Where'd you get the cut

00:18:11,981 --> 00:18:13,215
on your forearm, man?

00:18:13,282 --> 00:18:14,717
You practicing for
a job at Benihana?

00:18:14,783 --> 00:18:15,718
Hey, this is a hospital.

00:18:15,784 --> 00:18:17,386
I got doctor-client
privilege here, huh?

00:18:17,453 --> 00:18:20,089
Well, you don't get
any privileges, Randy.

00:18:20,155 --> 00:18:21,824
You're wearing
stolen property.

00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:25,628
Let me trade that
bracelet in for this one.

00:18:25,694 --> 00:18:26,962
( <i>handcuffs click</i> )

00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:29,231
Ladies and gentlemen,
in this corner

00:18:29,298 --> 00:18:30,466
wearing red leather

00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:32,701
coming from
the great fighting city

00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:34,203
of Everlast, USA...

00:18:35,538 --> 00:18:37,273
the gloves
that Javier Molina wore

00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:38,841
when he killed Laroi Steele.

00:18:38,908 --> 00:18:40,676
This is a piece
of boxing history.

00:18:40,743 --> 00:18:41,810
Do you know how much

00:18:41,877 --> 00:18:43,178
this would go for
on eBay?

00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:45,481
Greg, the residue
on the gloves, what is it?

00:18:45,548 --> 00:18:48,517
Half inorganic salts:
magnesium, potassium, etcetera

00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:50,286
and half
organic derivatives:

00:18:50,352 --> 00:18:52,454
urea, choline and uric acid.

00:18:52,521 --> 00:18:53,656
Sweat.

00:18:53,722 --> 00:18:54,657
Occasionally found

00:18:54,723 --> 00:18:55,925
at a boxing match.

00:18:55,991 --> 00:18:57,259
Oh, but wait.

00:18:57,326 --> 00:18:59,195
In this corner

00:18:59,261 --> 00:19:01,597
fighting <i>way</i> out
of his weight class

00:19:01,664 --> 00:19:05,100
coming from... that place
that textiles come from

00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:06,535
a cotton swab

00:19:06,602 --> 00:19:08,170
soaked in sufentanil.

00:19:09,271 --> 00:19:10,673
BROWN:
Sufentanil?

00:19:10,739 --> 00:19:13,943
I did recover this swab
from the victim's corner.

00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:17,313
Time to talk to the cut man.

00:19:17,379 --> 00:19:19,181
I would have got a bonus
if we won.

00:19:19,248 --> 00:19:21,450
Why would I mess
with the guy who pays me?

00:19:21,517 --> 00:19:22,685
Why is for
the lawyers.

00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,788
BROWN:
Your corner, your swab

00:19:25,855 --> 00:19:27,523
your drugs.

00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:31,493
Suck it up.

00:19:33,596 --> 00:19:35,030
I been doing this 28 years.

00:19:35,097 --> 00:19:38,167
Back when every cut man around
was using Monsels solution

00:19:38,234 --> 00:19:39,635
getting it in kids' eyes

00:19:39,702 --> 00:19:41,403
blinding them.

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,439
I wouldn't touch the stuff.

00:19:43,505 --> 00:19:45,307
And I didn't hurt Laroi.

00:19:45,374 --> 00:19:47,343
I been in his corner
six fights.

00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:49,578
Every one, he fought hard
and never stiffed me.

00:19:49,645 --> 00:19:52,147
Him dying
was a tragedy.

00:19:53,782 --> 00:19:55,251
Molina trains here?

00:19:55,317 --> 00:19:57,052
Yeah, maybe.
He owns the place.

00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,654
And you're looking for work.

00:20:00,022 --> 00:20:01,724
Work comes to me.

00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,393
Well, here's something else
that's coming to you.

00:20:08,864 --> 00:20:10,699
What, you want me

00:20:10,766 --> 00:20:11,934
to give you my bag?

00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:14,270
We're not asking.

00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:27,383
It's kind of primitive.

00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:28,984
So is boxing.

00:20:30,886 --> 00:20:32,788
Did you get anywhere
with that mercury?

00:20:32,855 --> 00:20:33,989
Yeah. Ensenada, Mexico.

00:20:34,056 --> 00:20:36,192
Molina has a personal
physician down there.

00:20:36,258 --> 00:20:37,860
It turns out that
mercury is used

00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:39,295
in a folk remedy
for <i>empacho.</i>

00:20:39,361 --> 00:20:40,996
It's a chronic
stomach condition.

00:20:41,063 --> 00:20:41,834
And Molina has it?

00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:43,236
Medical history
confirms it.

00:20:43,303 --> 00:20:44,270
The guy eats metal.

00:20:44,337 --> 00:20:46,272
It's not the eating
that will get you.

00:20:46,339 --> 00:20:48,074
The poison's
in the mercury vapor.

00:20:48,141 --> 00:20:49,075
It's toxic.

00:20:49,142 --> 00:20:50,417
Well, I guess we're
left with the sedative.

00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,351
Any luck?

00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:52,619
Greg's working on it.

00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:53,953
Three guns
found at the scene.

00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,189
None match the bullets
recovered from the victim.

00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:57,257
What does that tell us?

00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:58,525
The shooter
kept his weapon.

00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:00,602
Means he likes
his gun

00:21:00,668 --> 00:21:01,333
and may have

00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,534
used it before.

00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,185
Which is where the shell case
and IBAS come in.

00:21:06,252 --> 00:21:08,054
I'll run it against
the national database.

00:21:08,121 --> 00:21:11,125
Firing pin impressions
and breech face marks

00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,226
a closer look.

00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:13,861
Well, okay.

00:21:13,928 --> 00:21:14,862
Got us a hit.

00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:16,197
Los Angeles County

00:21:16,263 --> 00:21:18,399
Sheriff's Department
found

00:21:18,466 --> 00:21:20,234
shell casings from the same gun

00:21:20,301 --> 00:21:22,336
used in a gang murder
two years ago.

00:21:22,403 --> 00:21:24,372
They get a conviction
on the suspect?

00:21:24,438 --> 00:21:25,806
No. Guy beat the rap.

00:21:25,873 --> 00:21:28,943
"Timothy Fontaine,
aka 'Tiny Tim.'"

00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,612
Member
of the Snakebacks.

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,781
Current residence unknown.

00:21:33,848 --> 00:21:36,450
I bet I could find
where he stays in Vegas.

00:21:36,517 --> 00:21:37,752
Hey.

00:21:40,388 --> 00:21:44,191
CATHERINE:
I guess Tiny's mother can be
proud of her son for one thing.

00:21:44,258 --> 00:21:46,060
He sure knows how
to clean a room.

00:21:46,127 --> 00:21:49,196
Well, there is one
Snakeback still in town.

00:21:49,263 --> 00:21:50,231
Who's that?

00:21:50,297 --> 00:21:53,067
That guy
right over there.

00:21:53,134 --> 00:21:55,002
What's his dealio?

00:21:55,069 --> 00:21:58,172
Okay, I'm The Man,
I take care of my people.

00:21:58,239 --> 00:22:00,174
That is
Jerome Anderson.

00:22:00,241 --> 00:22:02,276
AKA, The Man.

00:22:02,343 --> 00:22:03,577
The Man?

00:22:03,644 --> 00:22:05,112
The Man.

00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:07,381
Technically a former
Snakeback who shed his skin

00:22:07,448 --> 00:22:09,250
and worked his way
into the real world.

00:22:09,316 --> 00:22:11,485
Record producer,
clothing designer

00:22:11,552 --> 00:22:13,421
sports agent.

00:22:13,487 --> 00:22:15,523
Why didn't you get
a warrant for his room?

00:22:15,589 --> 00:22:16,824
We're working on it.

00:22:16,891 --> 00:22:18,926
He's got an entire
law firm on retainer.

00:22:18,993 --> 00:22:20,728
...five percent here,
ten percent there.

00:22:20,795 --> 00:22:23,264
Better get back in the ring,
Laroi, and keep fighting.

00:22:23,331 --> 00:22:25,466
See, what Laroi needed
was a giver not a taker.

00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:27,834
That's why
he came to me, The Man

00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:29,333
so I could stand
by his side

00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,571
and give him honest
representation.

00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:32,826
Police.

00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,794
Another thing
that The Man understands

00:22:34,861 --> 00:22:36,596
because he comes from
the same place

00:22:36,663 --> 00:22:38,098
as today's
athletes.

00:22:38,165 --> 00:22:39,266
I'm Detective Vega.

00:22:39,332 --> 00:22:41,101
This is Catherine Willows
from the Crime Lab.

00:22:41,168 --> 00:22:42,636
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

00:22:42,702 --> 00:22:44,004
The Man ain't got
nothing to hide.

00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,005
We're looking
for members

00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:46,173
of the Snakebacks.

00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,441
A Timothy Fontaine,
in particular.

00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,077
No idea.

00:22:51,144 --> 00:22:53,647
The Man is here
on business.

00:22:53,713 --> 00:22:55,315
So are we.

00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,684
Do you mind
if I ask

00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,453
how The Man
got the burn mark on his neck?

00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,858
Well, all the ladies
say that The Man is hot.

00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,860
I guess I must have
just burned myself

00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:07,961
and forgot all about it.

00:23:09,462 --> 00:23:10,430
No, you didn't.

00:23:10,497 --> 00:23:12,966
Are you crazy?
No, no, no, no.

00:23:13,033 --> 00:23:14,367
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,203
Ooh, ooh...

00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,305
I guess you <i>are</i> hot.

00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:19,406
Oh, that's old.

00:23:19,473 --> 00:23:21,975
The Man
is all about the new.

00:23:30,484 --> 00:23:32,152
Did you get a hold
of that cut man?

00:23:32,219 --> 00:23:35,388
Yeah, we found sufentanil
in a bottle of coagulant

00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,923
in the guy's kit.

00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,892
Doesn't make sense.

00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,060
If the cut man did it

00:23:40,126 --> 00:23:41,628
why would he hold on
to the evidence?

00:23:41,695 --> 00:23:42,929
I was thinking
the same thing.

00:23:42,996 --> 00:23:45,232
I'm not convinced he actually
knew it was in his kit.

00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:48,435
The prints that I got
off the bottle came back to...

00:23:48,502 --> 00:23:53,340
Gerry Barone,
the victim's manager.

00:23:53,406 --> 00:23:57,878
And I thought
Don King was bad.

00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:01,560
The reason my prints
are in the system

00:24:01,627 --> 00:24:03,228
is I'm a foster parent.

00:24:03,295 --> 00:24:05,130
Six kids in 30 years.

00:24:05,197 --> 00:24:06,532
Treated them like my own.

00:24:06,598 --> 00:24:08,334
Trained them,
took them off the streets.

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,635
We know that.

00:24:09,702 --> 00:24:11,737
We know
you're a good guy.

00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:17,776
So what made you
dope up Laroi Steele?

00:24:17,843 --> 00:24:21,046
We found your prints on
a bottle of coagulant.

00:24:21,113 --> 00:24:25,517
It was laced with a sedative.

00:24:25,584 --> 00:24:27,119
Found it in the cut man's kit.

00:24:27,186 --> 00:24:29,321
I was trying to save Laroi.

00:24:29,388 --> 00:24:31,123
By drugging him?

00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,691
We kept it out of the press

00:24:32,758 --> 00:24:35,561
but in their last fight,
Molina hurt him bad.

00:24:35,627 --> 00:24:36,562
How bad?

00:24:36,628 --> 00:24:38,664
The signs were all there
in training--

00:24:38,731 --> 00:24:42,601
sagging eye, drooping shoulder,
brain damage down the road.

00:24:42,668 --> 00:24:44,436
Laroi couldn't handle
another beating.

00:24:44,503 --> 00:24:47,239
But I couldn't talk him
out of this fight.

00:24:47,306 --> 00:24:49,742
Molina got under his skin.

00:24:49,808 --> 00:24:52,945
Laroi wouldn't let it go.

00:24:53,012 --> 00:24:55,014
I taught him not to quit.

00:24:56,715 --> 00:24:59,685
<i>I was trying</i>
<i>to get him out alive.</i>

00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,591
Laroi was 16 years old
the first time I saw him fight.

00:25:05,658 --> 00:25:08,661
And the only thing
faster than his hands

00:25:08,727 --> 00:25:10,596
was his mouth.

00:25:10,663 --> 00:25:11,830
There was this one time

00:25:11,897 --> 00:25:15,267
he made his sparring partner
laugh so hard

00:25:15,334 --> 00:25:19,271
the man pissed his trunks
before he hit the mat.

00:25:21,173 --> 00:25:25,144
Can you imagine that?

00:25:28,547 --> 00:25:30,316
NICK:
We arrested the guy

00:25:30,382 --> 00:25:32,551
and recovered
all the jewelry.

00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:35,688
Thank you so much,
Mr. Stokes.
Not a problem.

00:25:35,754 --> 00:25:37,990
I just need you to fill out
some documentation

00:25:38,057 --> 00:25:40,826
and then I can release
your ring back to you, okay?

00:25:40,893 --> 00:25:42,161
That's not your ring.

00:25:42,227 --> 00:25:43,762
Of course it is.

00:25:43,829 --> 00:25:45,964
I'm telling you,
that is not the ring I gave you.

00:25:46,031 --> 00:25:47,099
That's a different cut.

00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:48,834
Now I wore this ring
on my finger

00:25:48,901 --> 00:25:50,202
every day for five years.

00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:52,705
I think that I...
I bought you
that ring.

00:25:52,771 --> 00:25:55,641
Who do you think spent the week
looking for the perfect stone

00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:58,010
for our first anniversary?

00:25:58,077 --> 00:25:59,511
Sir, I matched
every item recovered

00:25:59,578 --> 00:26:01,480
to a log provided
by the jewelry store

00:26:01,547 --> 00:26:02,781
piece for piece.

00:26:02,848 --> 00:26:04,383
Then maybe you should
explain to me

00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,517
why I'm not looking

00:26:05,584 --> 00:26:06,618
at my wife's ring.

00:26:06,685 --> 00:26:09,555
I need to explain to you?

00:26:09,621 --> 00:26:11,490
Come on, Mack.

00:26:11,557 --> 00:26:13,659
How do I know you didn't switch
this ring out?

00:26:13,726 --> 00:26:15,227
Man, I would n...

00:26:15,294 --> 00:26:16,962
'Cause that's not
the way it works.

00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:18,831
Oh, we screw
the out-of-towners

00:26:18,897 --> 00:26:21,033
and nobody's going
to care, right?

00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,335
Are you making
a formal accusation?
You bet I am.

00:26:23,402 --> 00:26:24,536
Knock yourself out,
big dog.

00:26:24,603 --> 00:26:25,838
Forms are
at the front desk.

00:26:33,145 --> 00:26:34,780
BROWN:
Okay...

00:26:34,847 --> 00:26:35,981
It's about a month ago

00:26:36,048 --> 00:26:38,651
at a pre-fight press conference.

00:26:38,717 --> 00:26:41,153
Check it out, he lost
the last couple of times.

00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,655
I'm the one who did
all the whupping.

00:26:42,721 --> 00:26:45,524
And I'm just going to do
a three-peat, baby, you know?

00:26:45,591 --> 00:26:47,760
What I'm saying is
anytime, anyplace, <i>cabron.</i>

00:26:47,826 --> 00:26:49,895
You can't wait to get whupped,
is that it?

00:26:51,964 --> 00:26:54,166
Steele is slurring his words.

00:26:54,233 --> 00:26:56,669
Fast forward

00:26:56,735 --> 00:26:58,871
to the fight.

00:26:58,937 --> 00:27:02,641
Watch his shoulder,
how he keeps dropping it.

00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,945
The manager was right.

00:27:07,012 --> 00:27:09,081
Pugilistic dementia.

00:27:09,148 --> 00:27:12,017
They say eight out of ten boxers
suffer some form of brain damage

00:27:12,084 --> 00:27:13,652
later on in life.

00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:15,521
The Greatest-- Muhammad Ali.

00:27:15,587 --> 00:27:18,557
Steele must've known
what was happening to him.

00:27:18,624 --> 00:27:20,693
He would never admit it.

00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:23,028
Fighters need to psych
themselves up before a fight.

00:27:23,095 --> 00:27:24,997
They got to believe
they're going to win.

00:27:25,064 --> 00:27:26,265
Or they'd never fight.

00:27:26,332 --> 00:27:29,668
In a way, every opponent
Laroi Steele fought

00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:31,970
contributed to his death.

00:27:35,641 --> 00:27:37,576
I don't know if he was
incredibly stupid

00:27:37,643 --> 00:27:40,679
or just... brave.

00:27:45,617 --> 00:27:47,019
We'll contest this
on the grounds

00:27:47,086 --> 00:27:48,320
that your request
to the judge

00:27:48,387 --> 00:27:51,123
was based on a specious
connection to the Snakebacks.

00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:53,826
Contest all you want.

00:27:53,892 --> 00:27:56,028
It's still coming
after the fact.

00:27:56,095 --> 00:27:57,329
Open.

00:27:57,396 --> 00:27:59,832
The warrant was based
on physical findings.

00:27:59,898 --> 00:28:02,134
A burn mark?

00:28:02,201 --> 00:28:03,669
Could have happened anywhere.

00:28:03,736 --> 00:28:06,271
Jerome is under
the misguided impression

00:28:06,338 --> 00:28:09,208
that he's a one-man
pyrotechnic display.

00:28:10,876 --> 00:28:12,678
Watch too many movies
and kids start to think

00:28:12,745 --> 00:28:14,313
that people actually
shoot like that.

00:28:17,816 --> 00:28:18,984
The most you're
going to prove

00:28:19,051 --> 00:28:20,352
is my client was
in the vicinity.

00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:22,087
Period.
That's it.

00:28:22,154 --> 00:28:24,056
If his DNA matches what we found
on the shell casing

00:28:24,123 --> 00:28:25,958
we'll be able to extend
the scope of the warrant.

00:28:26,025 --> 00:28:28,027
<i>If</i> it matches.

00:28:28,093 --> 00:28:29,928
File says you're a smart guy.

00:28:29,995 --> 00:28:31,363
Three years in Georgetown.

00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:33,265
Why turn stupid
all of a sudden?

00:28:33,332 --> 00:28:35,634
Give us the guy
we're looking for.

00:28:35,701 --> 00:28:37,436
WILLOWS:
Look, we all know

00:28:37,503 --> 00:28:39,304
that you forget what the word
"loyalty" means

00:28:39,371 --> 00:28:41,273
as soon as you step away
from the mirror

00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,609
so what do the Snakebacks
get you?

00:28:43,676 --> 00:28:46,478
R-E-S-P-E-C-T, baby.

00:28:46,545 --> 00:28:49,148
I thought that's what
college was for.

00:28:49,214 --> 00:28:52,484
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
I went to school.

00:28:52,551 --> 00:28:58,223
In fact, I have carefully
analyzed business models

00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:00,659
of African American
entrepreneurs

00:29:00,726 --> 00:29:02,494
such as Darian Daze
at Dis-Kard Enterprises

00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:05,831
which grosses
$250 million a year.

00:29:05,898 --> 00:29:07,866
And my analysis has
led me to understand

00:29:07,933 --> 00:29:10,336
that an emerging CEO

00:29:10,402 --> 00:29:13,972
needs to have as solid a command
of flow charts and spreadsheets

00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:16,709
as he does
a bad-ass street rep.

00:29:16,775 --> 00:29:20,245
And let me tell you something,
sweetness, I got it all

00:29:20,312 --> 00:29:21,914
coming and going.

00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,849
So the more you try to stress me

00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:26,018
the more you're just selling me

00:29:26,085 --> 00:29:28,320
to the people
out on the streets.

00:29:28,387 --> 00:29:31,323
So crime pays.

00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:34,994
Oh, don't hate the player,
hate the game.

00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,896
Right, you don't make the rules,
you just exploit them.

00:29:37,963 --> 00:29:40,366
Ain't that a bitch.

00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,718
Nice work on
that jewelry heist.

00:30:32,785 --> 00:30:34,286
Yeah, well,
it's not done yet.

00:30:34,353 --> 00:30:35,354
You got the guy.

00:30:35,421 --> 00:30:36,722
Oh, yeah, it was
a little rough.

00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:38,891
We had to check a few ERs,
but we snatched him up.

00:30:38,957 --> 00:30:41,960
Being efficient is not
a bad thing, Nick.

00:30:42,027 --> 00:30:43,729
Yeah. Why are you tossing me
a softball

00:30:43,796 --> 00:30:45,764
and putting everyone else
on real cases?

00:30:45,831 --> 00:30:47,633
You wanted to work solo.

00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,335
Yeah, but it's like
Night of the Pifflings out there

00:30:49,401 --> 00:30:50,336
and I'm on a smash and grab.

00:30:50,402 --> 00:30:51,870
Pifflings?

00:30:51,937 --> 00:30:53,906
Puffin offspring.

00:30:55,507 --> 00:30:57,009
First time out of the nest
every year

00:30:57,076 --> 00:30:58,777
they crash land in this town
near Iceland

00:30:58,844 --> 00:31:01,580
because they're attracted to the
lights of human civilization.

00:31:03,082 --> 00:31:06,652
It's the same way people
flock to Vegas for a fight.

00:31:09,188 --> 00:31:10,956
<i>Animal Planet.</i>

00:31:11,023 --> 00:31:12,491
How come when you talk
about bugs

00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:13,926
everyone says you're a genius

00:31:13,993 --> 00:31:15,494
but when I talk
about birds

00:31:15,561 --> 00:31:18,030
everyone says
I watch too much television?

00:31:18,097 --> 00:31:19,999
I don't know.

00:31:20,065 --> 00:31:22,901
Look, the next night
of the Pifflings

00:31:22,968 --> 00:31:24,970
you get the first dead body.

00:31:25,037 --> 00:31:26,605
Copy that.

00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:31,844
The victim suffered
tripod fractures

00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,546
of the zygomatic arch
in two places.

00:31:34,613 --> 00:31:37,149
There's also a fracture
of the orbital floor.

00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,218
This tripod fracture
of the zygoma

00:31:39,284 --> 00:31:41,086
is what caused the flattening

00:31:41,153 --> 00:31:43,222
of the victim's face.

00:31:43,288 --> 00:31:44,556
It indicates that
he was struck

00:31:44,623 --> 00:31:46,091
with an extremely
powerful blow.

00:31:46,158 --> 00:31:48,661
Which couldn't be caused
by normal boxing gloves.

00:31:48,727 --> 00:31:49,862
We checked Molina's gloves.

00:31:49,928 --> 00:31:51,397
There's nothing in them
or on them.

00:31:51,463 --> 00:31:53,332
Well, we're missing something.

00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:54,633
We have a problem.

00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,101
Pile it on.

00:31:56,168 --> 00:31:57,870
Well, in the interests
of posterity

00:31:57,936 --> 00:31:59,071
I took it upon myself

00:31:59,138 --> 00:32:01,206
to establish provenance
for the killer gloves

00:32:01,273 --> 00:32:02,408
I mean DNA-wise.

00:32:02,474 --> 00:32:03,509
On my own time,
of course

00:32:03,575 --> 00:32:05,511
of which I have
precious little

00:32:05,577 --> 00:32:07,112
so that should count
for something.

00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:09,248
Greg, why are you
always doing this?

00:32:09,314 --> 00:32:11,250
Because you make me nervous.

00:32:11,317 --> 00:32:14,053
My point is,
the epithelials

00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:16,755
found on the surface
of the glove.

00:32:16,822 --> 00:32:18,424
They're not Laroi Steele's.

00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:20,326
Those aren't the gloves
that killed him.

00:32:51,417 --> 00:32:53,519
Gloves look brand-new.

00:32:53,585 --> 00:32:54,953
Padding's still stiff.

00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,389
It's like
they've never been used.

00:33:06,565 --> 00:33:09,468
What are all these dots?

00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:22,147
Looks like a little piece
of red leather.

00:33:22,214 --> 00:33:24,550
Hmm.

00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:33,425
And more mercury.

00:33:33,492 --> 00:33:35,928
Well, Molina does take it
for his stomach, right?

00:33:35,994 --> 00:33:39,431
He's a sloppy eater.

00:33:40,733 --> 00:33:43,202
Hmm.

00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:44,670
Mercury's volatile.

00:33:44,737 --> 00:33:48,006
It emits a toxic vapor
at room temperature.

00:33:48,073 --> 00:33:50,175
So you're saying
if I find the vapor

00:33:50,242 --> 00:33:52,244
I find the mercury.

00:34:30,516 --> 00:34:31,683
Grissom.

00:35:08,353 --> 00:35:09,788
BRASS:
That your
signature?

00:35:09,855 --> 00:35:11,457
Yeah. That's my signature.

00:35:11,523 --> 00:35:12,208
So what?

00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:13,443
Well, according to fight rules

00:35:13,509 --> 00:35:15,545
you were supposed
to watch Molina wrap his hands

00:35:15,611 --> 00:35:17,580
and sign them,
then watch him put on his gloves

00:35:17,647 --> 00:35:19,125
and then sign those.

00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:20,059
Which is what I did.

00:35:20,126 --> 00:35:21,661
SIDLE:
Okay, you
signed his wraps

00:35:21,727 --> 00:35:23,229
but the gloves
that we found

00:35:23,296 --> 00:35:25,750
were not the gloves
used in the fight.

00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,952
Molina switched them.

00:35:27,018 --> 00:35:28,753
There's no way.

00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,255
You watched Molina glove up?

00:35:30,322 --> 00:35:32,424
Not exactly.

00:35:32,491 --> 00:35:35,291
Come on.
Get her out of here.

00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:36,992
CROSS:
<i>Look. It was a big fight.</i>

00:35:37,059 --> 00:35:37,993
There was
a lot of pressure.

00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,562
You've got to give the fighters
a little space.

00:35:39,628 --> 00:35:43,032
So, no one saw him
put his gloves on.

00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:48,594
I guess not.

00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,396
I should have called you first
to apologize

00:35:51,463 --> 00:35:53,866
for my husband's
unfortunate outburst.

00:35:53,932 --> 00:35:56,201
You know what?
You should apologize.

00:35:56,268 --> 00:35:57,870
But not for your husband.

00:35:57,936 --> 00:35:59,004
Excuse me?

00:35:59,071 --> 00:36:00,472
You know damn well
your diamond

00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:01,473
isn't a diamond.

00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,442
It's a substance
called moissanite.

00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:05,277
Really?

00:36:05,344 --> 00:36:08,280
Really. White light refractions
and inclusions of your stone

00:36:08,347 --> 00:36:10,215
are inconsistent
with a real diamond's.

00:36:10,282 --> 00:36:12,885
Then the thief
must have switched the stone

00:36:12,951 --> 00:36:14,319
before you caught him.

00:36:14,386 --> 00:36:16,355
The <i>thief.</i> Yeah.

00:36:16,421 --> 00:36:17,990
I don't think so.

00:36:18,056 --> 00:36:20,225
Because before the store
could clean your ring

00:36:20,292 --> 00:36:21,994
I was able to collect DNA.

00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,230
Wow, that's very thorough
of you.

00:36:25,297 --> 00:36:26,398
Isn't it?

00:36:26,465 --> 00:36:27,432
You know, it's my guess

00:36:27,499 --> 00:36:29,268
you switched out the
stone some time ago

00:36:29,334 --> 00:36:31,270
because judging from
your husband's response

00:36:31,336 --> 00:36:33,038
he knew nothing
about it.

00:36:33,105 --> 00:36:34,173
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,641
Mr. Stokes,
can I...?

00:36:35,707 --> 00:36:37,509
You're from Texas,
aren't you?

00:36:37,576 --> 00:36:39,144
'Cause I can always tell.

00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:41,980
I'm a criminalist for
Clark Country, Nevade.

00:36:42,047 --> 00:36:44,416
Yes, well, one's body
might reside elsewhere

00:36:44,483 --> 00:36:47,319
but one's heart never really
leaves home, does it?

00:36:48,954 --> 00:36:50,189
Look, all you
have to do

00:36:50,255 --> 00:36:54,493
is say that you recovered
a fake diamond

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,161
which is the truth.

00:36:56,228 --> 00:36:58,664
So you can file a
false insurance claim
which is a felony?

00:36:58,730 --> 00:36:59,832
Better yet,
why don't I have

00:36:59,898 --> 00:37:01,133
an adjuster come
over to your place

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,302
and check out all your rocks
and see which ones are real

00:37:03,368 --> 00:37:04,636
and which ones
you've switched out?

00:37:04,703 --> 00:37:06,472
No?

00:37:06,538 --> 00:37:08,173
Look, if you
find yourself

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,143
in a hole, the best thing
to do is stop digging.

00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,478
You know what I mean?

00:37:12,544 --> 00:37:14,713
Sounds like a plan.

00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,682
Put it in motion.

00:37:19,084 --> 00:37:21,019
I guess clothes
<i>do</i> make "the man."

00:37:21,086 --> 00:37:24,389
In this case,
"the man" makes the clothes.

00:37:24,456 --> 00:37:28,494
And produces the music
and represents the athletes...

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,865
when he's not involved
in street shootings, of course.

00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:34,666
And when you asked him
what he was wearing

00:37:34,733 --> 00:37:36,635
the night of the murder,
he couldn't remember?

00:37:36,702 --> 00:37:37,703
As far as he's concerned

00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:39,705
murder is just another way
to separate himself

00:37:39,771 --> 00:37:42,374
from the Calvins and Ralphs
of the world.

00:37:42,441 --> 00:37:44,877
Calvin and Ralph?

00:37:44,943 --> 00:37:47,045
Klein and Lauren.
Fashion.

00:37:47,112 --> 00:37:50,482
Oh. Well, for most CSIs,
fashion is irrelevant.

00:37:50,549 --> 00:37:51,850
Speak for
yourself.

00:37:51,917 --> 00:37:53,886
The only thing between me
and a wardrobe like this

00:37:53,952 --> 00:37:55,354
is a few extra zeros
on my paycheck.

00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,657
Well, what's standing between
you and this Tiny Tim character?

00:37:58,724 --> 00:37:59,858
The Mojave.

00:37:59,925 --> 00:38:02,227
Highway patrol is out looking
for our guy.

00:38:02,294 --> 00:38:04,763
Odds are that Tiny Tim
is back in L.A.

00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:07,099
Evidence disposed of
along the way.

00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:09,635
That means my last chance
of connecting the dots

00:38:09,701 --> 00:38:11,270
is somewhere
along these racks.

00:38:11,336 --> 00:38:13,172
Fibers, GSR, blood.

00:38:13,238 --> 00:38:17,276
Hey. Guess who never left town?

00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:26,685
WILLOWS:
Calling card?

00:38:26,752 --> 00:38:28,921
10th Street Vandals.

00:38:31,924 --> 00:38:34,226
.380 automatic.

00:38:34,293 --> 00:38:36,061
Tiny's favorite piece.

00:38:36,128 --> 00:38:37,963
Odds are
it traces back

00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,131
to the original murder.

00:38:39,198 --> 00:38:41,200
Same as it always does.

00:38:41,266 --> 00:38:42,634
Somebody gets dissed.

00:39:04,256 --> 00:39:06,592
The Snakebacks kill a Vandal.

00:39:06,658 --> 00:39:08,260
Then the Vandals kill

00:39:08,327 --> 00:39:09,828
a Snakeback.

00:39:09,895 --> 00:39:11,296
Everyone goes home satisfied.

00:39:11,363 --> 00:39:13,665
Round and round and round
it goes.

00:39:13,732 --> 00:39:16,568
Where it stops, nobody knows.

00:39:19,404 --> 00:39:22,074
There was this one case
where a boxer put lead shot

00:39:22,141 --> 00:39:24,476
in his gloves to increase
his punching power.

00:39:24,543 --> 00:39:26,745
And also ancient Greek
and Roman pugilists

00:39:26,812 --> 00:39:29,548
used a glove weighted
with metal, called a "cestus."

00:39:29,615 --> 00:39:31,316
You making a
classical reference?

00:39:31,383 --> 00:39:33,018
Yeah. I thought
you'd like that.

00:39:33,085 --> 00:39:35,754
Question is, if Molina was
using mercury to load up

00:39:35,821 --> 00:39:37,322
how'd it get
into his gloves?

00:39:37,389 --> 00:39:38,557
Well, he injected it.

00:39:38,624 --> 00:39:41,360
Those circular pieces
of leather that you found

00:39:41,426 --> 00:39:43,162
in Molina's locker
are the same diameter

00:39:43,228 --> 00:39:45,264
as a 14-gauge needle.

00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,399
Well, mercury's
incredibly dense.

00:39:47,466 --> 00:39:49,268
It could easily be
contained in the leather

00:39:49,334 --> 00:39:50,602
in the form of
a boxing glove.

00:39:50,669 --> 00:39:52,070
The boxing gloves
weighed eight ounces

00:39:52,137 --> 00:39:53,906
so the question is,
would a few ounces

00:39:53,972 --> 00:39:55,607
of mercury
be enough to cause

00:39:55,674 --> 00:39:57,309
the damage that we observed
on the victim?

00:39:57,376 --> 00:39:59,011
Right.

00:39:59,077 --> 00:40:01,413
I smell an experiment.

00:40:02,514 --> 00:40:05,184
All right.

00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,552
Normal gloves.

00:40:08,687 --> 00:40:09,888
Ready.

00:40:11,123 --> 00:40:12,991
And... go.

00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,035
Good?

00:40:23,101 --> 00:40:25,137
Little more.

00:40:30,676 --> 00:40:32,311
Good.

00:40:35,314 --> 00:40:37,649
Loaded gloves.

00:40:37,716 --> 00:40:39,618
Ready?

00:40:39,685 --> 00:40:40,752
SIDLE:
And...

00:40:40,819 --> 00:40:42,054
go.

00:40:46,892 --> 00:40:48,427
Ooh, this thing's are heavy.

00:40:53,465 --> 00:40:54,666
Good.

00:40:54,733 --> 00:40:56,368
Good, good.

00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:01,673
GRISSOM:
And mercury

00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,275
kills steel.

00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,645
Boxing is a combat sport.

00:41:06,712 --> 00:41:08,781
Sometimes fighters die, okay?

00:41:08,847 --> 00:41:09,948
That's all part
of the game.

00:41:10,015 --> 00:41:11,583
Laroi Steele's death
was a tragedy

00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:12,618
not a murder.

00:41:12,684 --> 00:41:13,652
It became murder

00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:15,821
when your client injected
mercury into his gloves.

00:41:15,888 --> 00:41:17,022
SIDLE:
And your hands,
Molina

00:41:17,089 --> 00:41:19,358
literally, became
lethal weapons.

00:41:32,871 --> 00:41:34,072
BROWN:
<i>Heavy gloves.</i>

00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:37,009
<i>That's why you kept your hands</i>
<i>to your side.</i>

00:41:37,075 --> 00:41:38,644
<i>It also kept the mercury</i>

00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,479
<i>on the tip of your glove.</i>
SIDLE:
<i>With every punch</i>

00:41:40,546 --> 00:41:42,915
<i>a little bit got forced down</i>
<i>through the padding</i>

00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:45,050
<i>through the seams</i>
<i>and on to your hands.</i>

00:41:45,117 --> 00:41:46,318
<i>That's how it got</i>
<i>on your wraps.</i>

00:41:46,385 --> 00:41:47,886
BROWN:
And into your lungs.

00:41:47,953 --> 00:41:50,122
SIDLE:
And finally out
into your urine.

00:41:50,189 --> 00:41:52,157
We tested the sample
that you gave the
boxing commission

00:41:52,224 --> 00:41:53,158
after the fight.

00:41:53,225 --> 00:41:54,993
It came back positive
for mercury.

00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,028
I have <i>empacho.</i>

00:41:56,094 --> 00:41:58,030
I take mercury
for my stomach problems.

00:41:58,096 --> 00:42:00,599
We didn't find mercury
in your stomach.

00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:02,301
We found it
in your locker

00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,236
in your gym bags,
on your wraps...

00:42:04,303 --> 00:42:06,738
SIDLE:
When the fight was
over, your trainer

00:42:06,805 --> 00:42:08,240
cut the tape off
your gloves

00:42:08,307 --> 00:42:10,943
and you took the
pieces and put them
in the hamper

00:42:11,009 --> 00:42:12,644
with a pair of
sparring gloves,
just in case

00:42:12,711 --> 00:42:14,646
anybody wondered what
had happened to them.

00:42:14,713 --> 00:42:16,815
BROWN:
But the real gloves
were in your gym bag

00:42:16,882 --> 00:42:19,351
at that hospital, weren't they?

00:42:21,286 --> 00:42:24,490
Steele had already
kicked your ass... twice before?

00:42:24,556 --> 00:42:27,726
Must have been
humiliating.

00:42:27,793 --> 00:42:32,364
You push a man too far,
there are consequences.

00:42:39,471 --> 00:42:42,641
You knew there was no way
you could beat Steele

00:42:42,708 --> 00:42:43,909
in a fair fight.

00:42:43,976 --> 00:42:46,545
BROWN:
The best way

00:42:46,612 --> 00:42:49,815
to punish a guy is
to beat him to death in the ring

00:42:49,882 --> 00:42:52,551
in front of two million people
on pay-per-view.

00:42:52,618 --> 00:42:54,953
That's boxing.

00:42:56,588 --> 00:42:57,723
No, that's murder.

00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:58,957
I'll see you in court.

00:43:06,532 --> 00:43:08,901
MAN 1:
So that means the
title's vacant, right?

00:43:08,967 --> 00:43:09,968
MAN 2:
Not for long.

00:43:10,035 --> 00:43:11,303
I heard it's Lopez

00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:13,829
versus Lewis at Caesar's
in six months.
