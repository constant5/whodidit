00:00:35,181 --> 00:00:38,321
MAN ( <i>over radio</i> ):
We have a high-speed chase
in progress.

00:00:41,257 --> 00:00:43,025
( <i>sirens wailing</i> )

00:00:45,526 --> 00:00:47,151
( <i>thudding, tires squealing</i> )
He is going in a tunnel.

00:00:56,026 --> 00:00:57,234
What's your stand of a pursuit?

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,734
The suspect become intoxicated.

00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:10,463
We will maintain.
Over.

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,466
( <i>sizzling</i> )

00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:16,900
Driver, cut the engine

00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,609
and throw the keys
out the window.

00:01:19,192 --> 00:01:20,817
Driver, cut the engine

00:01:20,817 --> 00:01:22,385
and throw the keys
out the window!

00:01:48,778 --> 00:01:50,980
GRISSOM:
Excuse us.
Excuse me, sir.

00:01:51,047 --> 00:01:52,348
Thank you.

00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:56,886
Death-- the cheapest
show in Vegas.

00:01:56,953 --> 00:01:58,555
Yeah, it doesn't surprise me.

00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:00,056
You remember the MGM fire?

00:02:00,123 --> 00:02:02,592
We found people burned
to their slot machines

00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:04,027
'cause they wouldn't
leave the action.

00:02:04,093 --> 00:02:05,495
Only in Vegas.

00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,439
This guy's got a piece of wood
sticking out of his head.

00:02:16,506 --> 00:02:17,474
Alex James,
age 42.

00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,677
Found his wallet
in the glove compartment.

00:02:20,743 --> 00:02:22,612
SUV is registered to him.

00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:24,113
No previous record.

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,015
How was he able to drive?

00:02:26,082 --> 00:02:30,153
I once saw a guy walk 15 blocks
with three bullets in his face.

00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,788
The victim was traveling west
on Flamingo.

00:02:31,855 --> 00:02:33,389
The Desert Palm isn't too far
from here.

00:02:33,456 --> 00:02:35,225
I guess he was en route
to the hospital.

00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:39,095
I don't much care
where he was going.

00:02:39,162 --> 00:02:40,930
I want to know where he's been.

Yeah, makes us

00:03:31,595 --> 00:03:33,029
Let me help you,

00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:34,297
No, thanks.

00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:36,433
Oh, it's not luggage.
Thank you, though.

00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,767
You must be CSI.

00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:39,769
I'm Warrick Brown.
This is Catherine Willows.

00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:42,005
You said you had
a situation in
your casino?

00:03:42,072 --> 00:03:43,006
A kidnap.

00:03:43,073 --> 00:03:44,307
Is it a high profile?

00:03:44,374 --> 00:03:46,743
Yes. We'd like to deal
with this locally

00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,345
before we involve
the FBI.

00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:51,414
Well, until we know
the victim was taken
over state lines,

00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,949
the FBI has no
jurisdiction.

00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:55,385
Do you have any contact
from the kidnappers?

00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:58,555
A ransom note was left
at the front desk.

00:03:58,622 --> 00:04:00,757
Who are we looking for here?

00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,359
A five-year-old boy.

00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:04,227
Whose
five-year-old boy?

00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:05,295
Tavian Tombs.

00:04:05,362 --> 00:04:08,031
Tavian Tombs,
professional basketball player.

00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:09,699
Very high profile.

00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:17,707
TOMBS:
I got eight people
to make sure

00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:19,910
that something like this
does not happen.

00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:21,344
Where the hell was everybody?

00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:22,512
Out spending my money?

00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:24,581
You're supposed to be
the head of security,

00:04:24,648 --> 00:04:26,283
and you let my son
get kidnapped

00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,352
right from under
my nose.

00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:31,688
You better have a good reason
for being here.

00:04:31,755 --> 00:04:33,890
We're here to find your son.

00:04:33,957 --> 00:04:36,193
WILLOWS:
We're with
the Crime Lab,

00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:39,329
and I'm assuming that
that's our ransom note.

00:04:39,396 --> 00:04:42,401
It's my note,
my kid, my show.

00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:43,609
BROWN:
Look, I've seen
you take out

00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:45,168
three guys on the glass
and still finish.

00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:47,137
I'm not here to
bang boards
with you.

00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,338
I'm here to
do my job.

00:04:48,405 --> 00:04:50,841
It's your son,
it's your call.

00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,679
BOY:
I'm going to dunk on you again.

00:04:55,745 --> 00:04:56,780
Yeah.

00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:04,721
"I have Isaiah.

00:05:04,788 --> 00:05:06,356
"Bring $5 million

00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:07,691
"to the northwest corner
of Telfair

00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:10,026
and Juniper,
4:00 a.m."

00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:12,095
How many of you
touched this letter?

00:05:12,162 --> 00:05:14,531
I did.
We all did.

00:05:14,598 --> 00:05:16,533
I just want my boy back.

00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,835
Did this note come
in an envelope?

00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,371
Yeah... I threw it
in the wastebasket.

00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:29,546
We have a better chance
of getting uncompromised prints

00:05:29,613 --> 00:05:30,914
off of this.

00:05:30,981 --> 00:05:33,950
You said that
Captain Brass
was here?

00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:36,853
Yeah. He's interviewing
the nanny.

00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,923
( <i>sighing</i> ):
We were at the carnival,
me and the boys.

00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,459
( <i>children cheering &amp;amp;amp; laughing)</i>

00:05:42,526 --> 00:05:45,095
<i>They wanted to ride</i>
<i>on the carousel. I said no.</i>

00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,933
But you gave in.

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,434
Special weekend.

00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:52,536
Dad's in town.

00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,904
Everybody's together.

00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,173
Trust me, they don't
understand "no."

00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:00,777
( <i>children cheering &amp;amp;amp; laughing)</i>

00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:10,287
Jason!

00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:11,922
Jason,
where's Isaiah?

00:06:11,988 --> 00:06:13,990
Jason!

00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:14,791
Where's your brother?!

00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:16,493
Jason, where's your brother?!

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,361
He was right there.

00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,833
And then he...

00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:25,936
I swear to you,
I looked everywhere,

00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:28,738
but I knew he was gone.

00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,241
( <i>sighs</i> ):
So...

00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,644
I brought the kids back here
and had to tell Tavian.

00:06:34,711 --> 00:06:36,112
And his wife.

00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:37,480
( <i>scoffs</i> ):
They're not married.

00:06:37,547 --> 00:06:39,749
And even if they were,
it'd still be Tavian's show.

00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,619
A woman who knows
her employer.

00:06:42,686 --> 00:06:43,854
I should.

00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,790
He's my brother.

00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:48,959
It took you that
long to pull the
paper together?

00:06:49,025 --> 00:06:50,727
Soft Count Room
wouldn't go any faster.

00:06:50,794 --> 00:06:53,296
The casino's fronting
the ransom money?

00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:55,109
Mr. Tombs has a
multimillion-dollar

00:06:55,109 --> 00:06:57,167
line of credit
with us.

00:06:57,234 --> 00:06:59,469
We <i>strongly</i> advise
that you don't

00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:00,704
hand over
that money.

00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,072
At least
let us mark it.

00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:05,242
You know how long it'd take
to mark $5 million large?

00:07:05,308 --> 00:07:06,510
The kidnapper knows.

00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:08,345
Longer than the
drop-off time.

00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:10,580
Now, the letter said corner
of Telfair and Juniper.

00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:13,416
That's where this bag is going.

00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:17,521
( <i>garbled radio transmission)</i>

00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,420
Sharp force trauma.

00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,151
Shouldn't we get
the spike out
of his head

00:07:27,151 --> 00:07:28,401
before we try to get
any prints off it?

00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:29,775
I'm afraid if we
try to remove it,

00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:31,176
we'll eradicate
the prints.

00:07:32,878 --> 00:07:34,513
( <i>shutter clicks</i> )

00:07:36,381 --> 00:07:38,183
I'm not going to get
any prints off of this.

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,918
Well, he sure is dirty.

00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:41,353
I mean, he isn't homeless.

00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,821
This is his car, right?

00:07:42,888 --> 00:07:44,489
Yeah.

00:07:44,556 --> 00:07:46,591
I'm going
to scrape his nails.

00:07:59,734 --> 00:08:01,536
GRISSOM:
Hand me a bindle.

00:08:08,843 --> 00:08:11,145
Hey, fellas,

00:08:11,212 --> 00:08:12,580
you're never going
to guess what I found

00:08:12,647 --> 00:08:13,581
under the seat.

00:08:13,648 --> 00:08:16,617
A .38 Special.

00:08:27,528 --> 00:08:29,397
Catherine wanted to know
if you have anything.

00:08:29,464 --> 00:08:30,431
She can't
convince Tavian

00:08:30,498 --> 00:08:32,200
to change his mind
about the ransom money.

00:08:32,266 --> 00:08:34,469
8 1/2 x 11 plain white
copy paper.

00:08:34,535 --> 00:08:35,970
It's mass-produced.

00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:37,805
You can get it anywhere.

00:08:37,872 --> 00:08:40,675
The envelope, unfortunately,
is self-adhering.

00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:42,009
No DNA.
No.

00:08:42,076 --> 00:08:43,878
What about the text?

00:08:43,945 --> 00:08:45,980
It's just standard laser,
nondescript.

00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:47,381
So you got nothing.

00:08:47,448 --> 00:08:48,950
Nothing I can <i>see.</i>

00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:51,285
( <i>writing</i> )

00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:07,702
( <i>lid clamping</i> )

00:09:09,303 --> 00:09:10,905
( <i>suction whirring</i> )

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,846
( <i>whirring stops</i> )

00:10:04,192 --> 00:10:07,395
Looks like something
out of <i>Nosferatu.</i>

00:10:07,462 --> 00:10:08,530
Yeah, only
the wooden stake

00:10:08,596 --> 00:10:11,433
is in his head,
not his heart.

00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:13,068
I've never seen
that before--

00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:14,436
a wooden stake embedded

00:10:14,502 --> 00:10:16,871
in the high parietal
scalp in the midline.

00:10:16,938 --> 00:10:20,075
Hold his head down
firmly, will you?

00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:22,544
On three.

00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,978
One...

00:10:24,045 --> 00:10:25,213
two... three!

00:10:34,756 --> 00:10:37,859
Irregular puncture
defect to the scalp,

00:10:37,926 --> 00:10:41,396
laceration
to the sagittal sinus.

00:10:41,463 --> 00:10:44,099
The wound track stops
at the falx cerebri.

00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:46,534
No gross penetration
of the cerebrum.

00:10:46,601 --> 00:10:49,504
That stake is what
kept him driving.

00:10:49,571 --> 00:10:50,739
Tamponading?

00:10:50,805 --> 00:10:52,607
Well, the application of
more than normal pressure

00:10:52,674 --> 00:10:54,976
to the wound
acts like a plug,

00:10:55,043 --> 00:10:57,445
temporarily keeping him alive.

00:10:57,512 --> 00:10:59,247
The spike
probably struck

00:10:59,314 --> 00:11:01,783
<i>between the brain hemispheres</i>

00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,451
most likely lodging
into the parietal bones

00:11:03,518 --> 00:11:04,719
and holding it

00:11:04,786 --> 00:11:06,021
in place.

00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:07,622
They say it's
a game of inches--

00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:09,290
a centimeter to
the left or right,

00:11:09,357 --> 00:11:11,626
and he would have bled
out and died instantly.

00:11:11,693 --> 00:11:12,927
Yeah, but head trauma
this severe,

00:11:12,994 --> 00:11:14,662
surgery would've probably
killed him anyway.

00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:15,764
That,

00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,166
or live an extra hour
in excruciating pain.

00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:21,202
They weren't lying.

00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:22,670
They all touched it.

00:11:22,737 --> 00:11:24,305
Everybody's who's got
a piece of Tavian

00:11:24,372 --> 00:11:25,640
got a hand
on that ransom note.

00:11:25,707 --> 00:11:27,442
Even the bellman
and the desk clerk

00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:28,877
left prints
on the envelope.

00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:30,211
Any unidentified
prints?

00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:32,647
Just a few smudges,
a couple of partials.

00:11:32,714 --> 00:11:33,815
So prints don't help.

00:11:33,882 --> 00:11:34,983
No.

00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,651
Liquid extraction
results.

00:11:36,718 --> 00:11:38,953
Yeah, that was detected
on the ransom note--

00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,121
menthol
and nicotine.

00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,492
<i>Nicotine.</i>

00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:47,929
So we're looking for a smoker--
menthol smoker.

00:12:08,516 --> 00:12:09,951
Everybody hold.

00:12:10,018 --> 00:12:13,421
We don't make a move until
after he's taken the money.

00:12:26,701 --> 00:12:28,803
( <i>both sighing</i> )

00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,372
Stand down.

00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:37,379
We're way past
the drop time here.

00:12:37,445 --> 00:12:40,749
Yeah. Well, let's
give it a couple more.

00:12:44,686 --> 00:12:47,288
So, what's your
take on this?

00:12:47,355 --> 00:12:48,723
Inside or outside job?

00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,759
No, I think it's
just some freak

00:12:50,825 --> 00:12:52,127
with a nicotine habit

00:12:52,193 --> 00:12:54,062
and access
to a laser printer.

00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:55,797
Did you see the
action he got?

00:12:55,864 --> 00:12:57,132
One phone call,

00:12:57,198 --> 00:12:59,801
$5 million
gets delivered
to his hotel?

00:12:59,868 --> 00:13:02,137
Yeah, that money's not doing
him any good now, huh?

00:13:02,203 --> 00:13:04,439
Yeah.

00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:11,980
It's just gone bad.
Oh, man.

00:13:12,047 --> 00:13:15,350
WARRICK:
Hey! Hey!

00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:17,085
What are
you doing?
Put the guns down!

00:13:17,152 --> 00:13:19,154
Put the guns down!

00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,155
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:13:20,221 --> 00:13:21,923
What the hell
are you doing?

00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,191
Tavian wanted me

00:13:23,258 --> 00:13:24,592
to be sure
the transfer got done.

00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:25,593
This is our job--

00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,562
not yours, not Tavian's.

00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:29,230
What are you
concerned
about here--

00:13:29,297 --> 00:13:30,365
the kid or your job?

00:13:30,432 --> 00:13:31,366
I didn't do nothing.

00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:32,667
Nobody took the money--
didn't even show.

00:13:32,734 --> 00:13:33,835
I been here all night
just like you.

00:13:33,902 --> 00:13:35,270
They spotted you.

00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:36,738
You understand?

00:13:36,805 --> 00:13:38,707
The kidnappers
saw you.

00:13:38,773 --> 00:13:40,241
They made us.
( <i>cell phone rings</i> )

00:13:40,308 --> 00:13:43,912
I was doing what
Tavian asked
me to, man.

00:13:43,978 --> 00:13:45,714
Brass.

00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,261
It's him.

00:14:02,564 --> 00:14:06,101
I'll take
the perimeter.

00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:07,969
Body's in an unnatural position.

00:14:08,036 --> 00:14:09,871
BRASS:
Maybe this is only
the dump site.

00:14:09,938 --> 00:14:14,642
His body's also coated.

00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:17,045
Makes me think
whoever did this

00:14:17,112 --> 00:14:19,114
didn't even stop the car.

00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,986
Something had
to have gone wrong.

00:14:25,053 --> 00:14:27,355
Something <i>did.</i>

00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:32,170
Do not let them cut him.

00:14:32,237 --> 00:14:34,739
I don't want them
even touching him.

00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:45,049
We're taking the body.

00:14:45,116 --> 00:14:46,251
Mr. Tombs

00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:48,453
I'm sorry,
but in a crime like this,

00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,888
an autopsy's mandatory.

00:14:49,954 --> 00:14:52,424
Evidence from your
son's body may lead us

00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,725
to the suspect.

00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,994
You're telling me what
I can and can't do?

00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,496
It's not your call anymore.

00:15:00,965 --> 00:15:03,068
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:08,206
How you doing
over there?

00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:09,340
I got scat.

00:15:09,407 --> 00:15:10,542
Feces?
Yep.

00:15:10,608 --> 00:15:11,743
Under the fingernail?

00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,744
Yep.

00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:16,414
He wiped his own ass?

00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:18,149
No, Nick, it's not human.

00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:19,451
It's scat.

00:15:21,686 --> 00:15:23,054
Could be from a bat.

00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:24,556
STOKES:
Bat scat.

00:15:24,622 --> 00:15:25,690
Bat guano.

00:15:25,757 --> 00:15:26,825
Well, whatever.

00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:28,693
It's a lot better
than what I got.

00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,628
As far as I can tell,
the wood's Douglas Fir

00:15:30,695 --> 00:15:32,697
with a side of God knows what.

00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:34,232
I'm no geologist,

00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:36,034
but these splinters
are intertwined

00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,435
with some kind of mineral.

00:15:37,502 --> 00:15:38,737
Is it sparkly?

00:15:38,803 --> 00:15:39,938
Oh, yeah.

00:15:40,004 --> 00:15:41,072
Let me see.

00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:49,881
I think it's quartz.
Or fluorite.

00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:51,082
Great.

00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:54,786
That limits it to every
outdoor area in Greater Nevada.

00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,988
Mountain ranges,
mine shafts,

00:15:57,055 --> 00:15:59,958
quarries... underground sewers.

00:16:00,024 --> 00:16:02,360
All home to bats.

00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:05,463
( <i>sighing</i> )

00:16:06,984 --> 00:16:09,053
Hey.

00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:13,737
Why don't you
let me handle this?

00:16:13,804 --> 00:16:15,772
Thanks.

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,343
I'm not ready to deal
with another murdered kid.

00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:22,212
I'll process
the evidence.

00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,685
No apparent
cause of death.

00:16:28,752 --> 00:16:30,987
I'll send a blood
sample to Tox.

00:16:33,423 --> 00:16:35,792
The foam around his mouth?

00:16:35,859 --> 00:16:37,894
Could indicate
pulmonary edema.

00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:39,696
Found bruising
in the lower extremities

00:16:39,763 --> 00:16:41,365
and the knees,

00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:43,800
but these injuries
are a few days old.

00:16:43,867 --> 00:16:45,435
The bruises are at
various stages of healing.

00:16:45,502 --> 00:16:47,971
Well, that could be
from roughhousing

00:16:48,038 --> 00:16:49,006
with his older brothers.

00:16:49,072 --> 00:16:50,140
What about this bruise?

00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:52,642
Well...

00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:54,578
let's see,
it extends around the body...

00:16:54,644 --> 00:16:57,414
like so.

00:16:57,481 --> 00:16:59,649
Ah, I've seen
this before.

00:16:59,716 --> 00:17:02,252
Did you find rope at the scene?

00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,856
We haven't found the scene.

00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,218
Outer City
Salvage Company.

00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:40,353
Owned and operated
by Alex James.

00:17:43,123 --> 00:17:45,559
Las Vegas Police.
I have a warrant.

00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,827
I'll clear the back.

00:17:46,893 --> 00:17:48,161
Thanks.

saw a dinosaur like this?

Lemons on the reels.

00:17:58,071 --> 00:18:01,241
Not since Sam Braun
ran the town.

00:18:01,308 --> 00:18:02,709
Old Vegas.

00:18:08,582 --> 00:18:09,916
Buckshot pellets.

00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:11,485
Looks like he
loaded his own.

GRISSOM:
A melting furnace.

00:18:23,663 --> 00:18:24,831
What's that for?

00:18:24,898 --> 00:18:27,200
Melting precious metals.

00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:32,072
Quenched it in the tub?

00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,043
Hey, fellas,
take a look at this.

00:18:41,081 --> 00:18:43,383
More precious
metals.

00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,018
And the pawn tickets.

00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:49,289
Easily traceable.

00:18:54,394 --> 00:18:57,898
Topographical maps
of the Sierra Nevada.

Hey, Nick.

00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,687
Blood spatter and
a bullet hole, maybe?

00:19:24,324 --> 00:19:25,625
Through-and-through.

00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:31,298
Oh, yeah.

00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:35,202
Medium caliber.

00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,005
This is our primary crime scene?

00:19:39,072 --> 00:19:42,342
Except that our vic had a stake
in his head. He wasn't shot.

00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:44,377
Yeah, but he had
a .38 in his car.

00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:47,781
We're looking for another body.

00:19:55,234 --> 00:19:56,335
It was a tip.

00:19:56,402 --> 00:19:57,503
A $10,000 gold chip?

00:19:58,984 --> 00:19:59,918
I don't think so.

00:19:59,985 --> 00:20:01,650
If it was a tip,
you wouldn't have had to lose

00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,568
the bellman's outfit

00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:03,276
to cash it in.

00:20:03,276 --> 00:20:03,859
Now where'd
you get this?

00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:05,401
I found it, sort of.

00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:06,692
You found it sort of.

00:20:07,317 --> 00:20:08,818
Tavian is always
surrounded by women.

00:20:08,885 --> 00:20:10,386
Guys, too,
but they want autographs.

00:20:10,453 --> 00:20:12,555
The chicks--
they want something else.

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,895
Now, usually
his boys turn them away,

00:20:18,962 --> 00:20:20,296
but this one got through.

00:20:20,363 --> 00:20:22,465
Get the hell
out of my way.

00:20:22,532 --> 00:20:23,733
I want to
see Tavian.

00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:27,770
There were definitely
chicks a lot hotter,

00:20:27,837 --> 00:20:30,006
but I guess
when you can have anything...

00:20:30,073 --> 00:20:31,541
They leave together?
No, just the opposite.

00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:33,142
They got into it right there.

00:20:33,209 --> 00:20:34,744
You're a lousy
father to Tramelle.

00:20:34,811 --> 00:20:35,945
And you think

00:20:36,012 --> 00:20:37,113
the whole world worships you.

00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,748
But the truth is,
you're just a deadbeat.

00:20:38,815 --> 00:20:39,882
Whatever.

00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:42,218
This what you want?

00:20:42,285 --> 00:20:44,821
Casino taxes me $24 an hour

00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:46,055
regardless of what I make.

00:20:46,122 --> 00:20:47,857
And do you know
how much a zillionaire

00:20:47,924 --> 00:20:48,992
like Tavian Tombs tips?

00:20:49,058 --> 00:20:50,293
Zip. Nothing.

00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,828
Not even change

00:20:51,894 --> 00:20:53,329
I can throw in the fountain.

00:20:53,396 --> 00:20:55,898
And why? Because he's comped
all the way around.

00:20:55,965 --> 00:20:58,434
R.F.B.-- room, food, beverage--
including tips.

00:20:58,501 --> 00:21:00,870
So, when ten large goes
sliding across the floor,

00:21:00,937 --> 00:21:02,071
and nobody sees it?

00:21:02,138 --> 00:21:04,340
Get out of the way,
'cause Kevin's coming through.

00:21:08,945 --> 00:21:10,013
Yeah, I get the picture.

00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:11,848
Hey, I tried to give it back.

00:21:11,914 --> 00:21:13,816
This is yours.

00:21:13,883 --> 00:21:17,353
Keep it.

00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,188
Yeah, yeah, sure you did.

00:21:19,255 --> 00:21:21,257
So, uh, what about my money?

00:21:21,324 --> 00:21:23,226
Don't be stupid.

00:21:23,293 --> 00:21:24,794
Who's the blonde
he's talking about?

00:21:24,861 --> 00:21:25,995
I don't know.

00:21:26,062 --> 00:21:28,064
Look, big casinos honor
each other's chips.

00:21:28,131 --> 00:21:29,399
So, how you tracking these?

00:21:29,465 --> 00:21:31,234
Bar code,
embedded transmitters, what?

00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:32,402
Look, it's okay.

00:21:32,468 --> 00:21:34,837
It's easy for the guys
at the lab to figure this out,

00:21:34,904 --> 00:21:37,407
but we'll let the other casinos
know you helped us out.

00:21:37,473 --> 00:21:39,409
Her name is
Bridget Willis.

00:21:39,475 --> 00:21:41,044
She's on his list.

00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,479
Thank you.

00:21:46,349 --> 00:21:47,750

00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:51,521
to the gun
in the victim's car.

00:21:51,587 --> 00:21:53,656
As for the splinters
on the stake...

00:21:53,723 --> 00:21:54,891
you were right.

00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,894
Quartz. Fluorite.

00:21:57,961 --> 00:22:00,930
Dolomite, barite,
calcite, antimony.

00:22:00,997 --> 00:22:02,932
Well, the Mass Spec dug deeper.

00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:04,233
Arsenic and cyanide.

00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,169
Now, as of late,

00:22:06,235 --> 00:22:08,972
that's what's used
to extract gold.

00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:10,173
Do you have any idea

00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:12,508
how many mine shafts there are
in the state of Nevada?

00:22:12,575 --> 00:22:13,676
Yeah, hundreds.

00:22:13,743 --> 00:22:15,278
Including gold and silver mines

00:22:15,345 --> 00:22:17,146
in Nelson, Searchlight,
Goodsprings.

00:22:17,213 --> 00:22:18,514
You name it.

00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:20,483
I've got Lockwood running
a background check

00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,851
on our vic.

00:22:21,918 --> 00:22:24,220
Maybe we'll get lucky.

00:22:31,461 --> 00:22:32,662
BRASS:
Bridget Willis?

00:22:32,729 --> 00:22:33,830
Mm-hmm.

00:22:33,896 --> 00:22:35,632
I'm Detective Jim Brass,
Vegas PD.

00:22:35,698 --> 00:22:38,101
This is Catherine Willows
from the Crime Lab.

00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:39,268
You're here to talk

00:22:39,335 --> 00:22:41,738
to my son Tramelle?

00:22:45,608 --> 00:22:48,211
We already have.

00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:51,114
I was in college.

00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,517
He was the "man,"
Mr. Final Four.

00:22:54,584 --> 00:22:57,654
I thought I'd won the lottery.

00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,856
Then I got pregnant,

00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:01,924
and he went
<i>in</i> the lottery, so...

00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:06,062
Take a look around.
Guess what we fight about.

00:23:07,697 --> 00:23:09,532
Money.
He's rich, I'm not.

00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:11,534
I've accepted that.

00:23:11,601 --> 00:23:13,970
But he does
have responsibilities.

00:23:14,037 --> 00:23:14,971
Tramelle.

00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:16,039
A weekend here and there

00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:18,975
doesn't make a father.

00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:21,077
Tramelle's not one
of his "boys."

00:23:21,144 --> 00:23:24,380
He's his son.

00:23:24,447 --> 00:23:26,482
Kid comes home
with a armful of presents

00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:28,151
and a broken heart every time.

00:23:28,217 --> 00:23:29,385
Ms. Willis...

00:23:29,452 --> 00:23:31,554
is Tramelle your only child?

00:23:31,621 --> 00:23:32,722
No.

00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:34,991
I have a little girl.

00:23:35,058 --> 00:23:37,327
Why wasn't she with Tavian's
other kids at the carnival?

00:23:37,393 --> 00:23:39,028
She wasn't invited.

00:23:39,095 --> 00:23:40,096
I'm not taking her.

00:23:40,163 --> 00:23:41,531
I'm not taking your girl.

00:23:41,597 --> 00:23:43,833
Tramelle's been talking
about this weekend for months.

00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,834
She just wants to come.

00:23:44,901 --> 00:23:46,936
Then what you better do
is explain to her

00:23:47,003 --> 00:23:48,738
that I'm Tramelle's father,
not hers.

00:23:48,805 --> 00:23:50,907
What difference does
one little girl make?

00:23:50,974 --> 00:23:53,109
It's all about what's mine.

00:23:53,176 --> 00:23:55,044
GIRL:
Mommy.

00:23:55,111 --> 00:23:56,245
What's for lunch?

00:23:56,312 --> 00:23:57,347
Just a minute,

00:23:57,413 --> 00:23:58,615
okay, sweetie?

00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,019
So, instead,

00:24:03,086 --> 00:24:05,788
I took her to Sweet Creatures
at the Forum Shops.

00:24:05,855 --> 00:24:08,691
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:24:08,758 --> 00:24:10,293
Don't fill it too much, sweetie.

00:24:12,061 --> 00:24:13,997
Oh, yes, I've been there.

00:24:14,063 --> 00:24:15,164
Works wonders

00:24:15,231 --> 00:24:17,533
on the disappointments
of little girls.

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,436
That's what I was hoping for.

00:24:23,072 --> 00:24:24,507
For you.

00:24:24,574 --> 00:24:25,675
Thanks.

00:24:25,742 --> 00:24:26,843
Have you taken a look?

00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:28,011
I'm just trying to learn.

00:24:28,077 --> 00:24:29,178
Well?

00:24:29,245 --> 00:24:30,346
Well, the fiber
you tweezed

00:24:30,413 --> 00:24:31,514
from that sweatshirt--

00:24:31,581 --> 00:24:32,949
Trace pegged
it as sisal.

00:24:33,016 --> 00:24:34,250
Sisal?

00:24:34,317 --> 00:24:35,485
Rope?

00:24:35,551 --> 00:24:37,520
Mostly likely
from the restraint.

00:24:37,587 --> 00:24:40,023
What's under the scope?

00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:41,591
Take a look.

00:24:44,694 --> 00:24:45,928
Oh, hair.

00:24:45,995 --> 00:24:48,031
But cuticle's a single layer.

00:24:48,097 --> 00:24:50,667
Overlapping.

00:24:50,733 --> 00:24:52,135
It's not human.

00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:53,403
It's canine.

00:24:53,469 --> 00:24:55,705
Sweatshirt was riddled
with dog hair.

00:24:55,772 --> 00:24:57,140
Many different breeds.

00:24:57,206 --> 00:24:59,709
You think the kidnapper
used it as a lure?

00:24:59,776 --> 00:25:01,844
Kids love dogs.

00:25:01,911 --> 00:25:04,447
I know when I was a kid,
I was all over them.

00:25:04,514 --> 00:25:06,516
That's a good start.

00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,751
Thanks.

00:25:08,818 --> 00:25:12,088
Found them in Isaiah's
stomach contents.

00:25:12,155 --> 00:25:14,691
Pill casings.

00:25:14,757 --> 00:25:17,026
Starts to break down
as soon as it hits the mouth.

00:25:17,093 --> 00:25:18,294
<i>The shell is porous.</i>

00:25:18,361 --> 00:25:20,830
<i>In the stomach,</i>
<i>the medicine leeches out,</i>

00:25:20,897 --> 00:25:22,165
<i>enters the bloodstream.</i>

00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:23,599
<i>The case is left behind.</i>

00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:26,002
Eventually, the
casing's broken
down, as well,

00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:28,371
but by then,
the medicine's
already working.

00:25:28,438 --> 00:25:29,539
I see a USP number.

00:25:29,605 --> 00:25:31,207
Well, it should be
listed in the PDR,

00:25:31,274 --> 00:25:32,275
but I couldn't
find it.

00:25:32,342 --> 00:25:33,476
What have you got?

00:25:33,543 --> 00:25:35,545
Pill casings.

00:25:35,612 --> 00:25:37,046
He was drugged?

00:25:37,113 --> 00:25:38,715
Looks that way.

00:25:38,781 --> 00:25:40,383
Well, we lifted dog hair
from the sweatshirt

00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,551
we found near the body.

00:25:41,618 --> 00:25:43,686
So, our kidnapper had contact
with dogs.

00:25:43,753 --> 00:25:45,388
Multiple breeds.

00:25:45,455 --> 00:25:47,357
Dog lover? Dog walker?

00:25:47,423 --> 00:25:49,392
Hey, how about a vet?

00:25:49,459 --> 00:25:53,229
Try the reference
of Veterinary Pharmaceuticals

00:25:53,296 --> 00:25:55,765
and Biologicals.

00:26:04,974 --> 00:26:07,143
Acepromazine Maleate.

00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:09,112
Tranquilizer.

00:26:09,178 --> 00:26:10,113
25 milligrams.

00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:12,548
Four pills wouldn't
have been fatal

00:26:12,615 --> 00:26:14,350
for a child
Isaiah's size.

00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:15,485
Based on the
blood levels,

00:26:15,551 --> 00:26:16,586
these remnants were

00:26:16,653 --> 00:26:17,987
probably a second dose.

00:26:18,054 --> 00:26:19,822
BROWN:
It wasn't the money drop

00:26:19,889 --> 00:26:20,990
that went bad.

00:26:21,057 --> 00:26:22,525
The problem was Isaiah died.

00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,160
I'll call Brass.

00:26:24,227 --> 00:26:27,497
I'll have him check vet clinics,
kennels, pet supply stores,

00:26:27,563 --> 00:26:30,366
and we'll extend the radius out
from the dump site.

00:26:30,433 --> 00:26:31,768
Okay.

00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:34,037
Our man Alex James
is quite the land owner.

00:26:34,103 --> 00:26:35,972
According to the Mining Laws
of 1872,

00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:37,707
public land can still
be patented

00:26:37,774 --> 00:26:39,075
for five dollars an acre--

00:26:39,142 --> 00:26:40,743
a law which
is still in effect.

00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,045
That's all this guy did

00:26:42,111 --> 00:26:44,614
was buy and sell
publicly-owned, government land.

00:26:44,681 --> 00:26:46,616
Funny thing is,
there was one mine

00:26:46,683 --> 00:26:48,551
that he sold over
and over again.

00:26:48,618 --> 00:26:50,119
Now, why would he do that?

00:26:50,186 --> 00:26:51,854
Now, there lies
the mystery.

00:26:51,921 --> 00:26:53,957
So, who was the last
person he sold to?

00:26:54,023 --> 00:26:55,725
Joe McPherson. Local.

00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:56,826
Where is he now?

00:26:56,893 --> 00:26:57,994
No one knows.

00:26:58,061 --> 00:26:59,362
He's been missing for 48 hours.

00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:00,530
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:27:00,596 --> 00:27:01,831
There lies the mystery.

00:27:01,898 --> 00:27:04,067
Where's the mine?

00:27:09,172 --> 00:27:11,341
What's with the gate?

00:27:11,407 --> 00:27:12,542
It's a bat gate.

00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:15,378
It keeps people out,
lets the bats in.

00:27:15,445 --> 00:27:19,048
Old mines are considered
bat habitats and preserves.

00:27:19,115 --> 00:27:20,883
Who puts the bat
gates in?

00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,620
Batman.

00:27:31,761 --> 00:27:33,963
What have you got?

00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:36,065
Insect chitin.

00:27:36,132 --> 00:27:39,235
It's usually
found near the
entrance of caves.

00:27:49,712 --> 00:27:51,681
Guano.

00:27:51,748 --> 00:27:53,683
We got bats.

00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,851
Oh.

00:27:54,917 --> 00:27:56,085
Good.

00:27:59,255 --> 00:28:01,991
Probably California
Leaf-nosed Bats.

00:28:02,058 --> 00:28:04,260
They don't bite, do they?

00:28:04,327 --> 00:28:05,862
They're like bees, Nick.

00:28:05,928 --> 00:28:07,330
You don't bother them,

00:28:07,397 --> 00:28:08,498
they won't
bother you.

00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:11,134
Well, hey, let's...
let's not bother them, okay?

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,402
I'm serious.

00:28:27,517 --> 00:28:29,786
Are you seeing this?

00:28:29,852 --> 00:28:31,254
Gold.

00:28:31,321 --> 00:28:33,489
We're rich.

00:28:33,556 --> 00:28:36,159
I'm not so sure.

00:28:47,437 --> 00:28:49,906
Another buckshot casing.

00:28:49,973 --> 00:28:54,510
And these look
like impact patterns.

00:28:54,577 --> 00:28:55,979
So, he <i>was</i> loading his own.

00:28:56,045 --> 00:28:57,080
But not with pellets.

00:28:57,146 --> 00:28:58,348
With gold.

00:28:58,414 --> 00:29:00,316
Pawn shop jewelry
and melting furnace.

00:29:00,383 --> 00:29:02,085
You know, Lockwood
said that James

00:29:02,151 --> 00:29:04,587
sold this parcel of land
multiple times.

00:29:04,654 --> 00:29:07,423
I think he was running a scam.

00:29:37,654 --> 00:29:40,723
He was salting the mind.

00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:44,093
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:50,366
Insect party.

00:29:50,433 --> 00:29:51,668
Yeah.

00:29:51,734 --> 00:29:54,203
Cockroaches,
cave crickets.

00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,905
Carabid beetles.

00:29:55,972 --> 00:29:58,775
All heading deeper
into the cave.

00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:00,009
Why?

00:30:00,076 --> 00:30:01,244
Maybe they
got tired

00:30:01,311 --> 00:30:03,146
of eating bat guano.

00:30:04,447 --> 00:30:05,615
BRASS:
So, this is three blocks

00:30:05,682 --> 00:30:07,483
from the place
where Isaiah's body was found.

00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,818
Why don't you guys
take the kennel?

00:30:08,885 --> 00:30:11,220
Metcalf and I are going
to take the dog run.

00:30:13,222 --> 00:30:15,692
( <i>dogs barking</i> )

00:30:35,011 --> 00:30:38,014
( <i>barking continues</i> )

00:30:45,855 --> 00:30:49,092
( <i>ferocious barking</i> )

00:30:49,158 --> 00:30:50,193

( <i>barking</i> )

00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:22,053
We found something.
I think you wanna take a look at this.

00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:29,067
Jacob Price. Local.
He works night shift here.

00:31:30,775 --> 00:31:32,484
Looks like somebody
beat us to him.

00:31:36,692 --> 00:31:38,160
Partner you think?

00:31:38,226 --> 00:31:40,629
Or a guy who knows
how to finish.

00:31:45,151 --> 00:31:46,852
I don't want
to hear this.

00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:51,192
Yeah, well... I've been
on the job a long time,

00:31:51,984 --> 00:31:53,942
and I know what a
tragedy like this

00:31:53,942 --> 00:31:54,775
can do to a family.

00:31:54,775 --> 00:31:56,310
I told you,
I don't want to hear it.

00:31:56,376 --> 00:31:57,344
What's going
to happen

00:31:57,411 --> 00:31:59,046
is one day
Kenisha or Tramelle

00:31:59,112 --> 00:32:00,447
or one of
your other kids

00:32:00,514 --> 00:32:03,884
is going to come to
you and say, "What
happened to Isaiah?"

00:32:03,951 --> 00:32:06,453
And they're going to
want to know the truth.

00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,022
Nothing you say
is going to change anything.

00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:10,357
The guy who
took Isaiah

00:32:10,424 --> 00:32:12,226
worked in a kennel.

00:32:12,292 --> 00:32:14,328
<i>He was used to handling dogs,</i>
<i>not children.</i>

00:32:14,394 --> 00:32:17,164
When Isaiah
tried to escape,
he was restrained,

00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:18,765
and when that
didn't work,

00:32:18,832 --> 00:32:20,067
he was drugged.

00:32:27,441 --> 00:32:29,409
Now, drugs have
a different effect

00:32:29,476 --> 00:32:31,111
on adults than on children.

00:32:31,178 --> 00:32:33,447
It's called
"the paradoxical effect."

00:32:33,514 --> 00:32:35,192
So, when the
tranquilizers
weren't working,

00:32:35,192 --> 00:32:39,484
this guy-- Price--
upped the dosage.

00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,234
Now, as a father,

00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,770
I can understand
why you'd want this guy dead.

00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:54,906
What?

00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:56,974
Whoa.

00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,243
You think I killed him?

00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:07,652
Yes, I do.

00:33:10,354 --> 00:33:12,824
I didn't kill anybody.

00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,461
I don't even know who he is.

00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,863
But if I'd gotten to him
before you,

00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:22,366
I swear I would not have stopped
to think about it.

00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,939
Don't fill it too much, sweetie.

00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,808
You said the bigger the better.

00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:08,446
( <i>coughing</i> )

00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:10,181
Air's getting thick.

00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:13,885
Smells like
trinitrotoluene.

00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,053
( <i>coughs</i> )

00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,661
Look familiar?

00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:27,231
Yeah. But how did it get
in the back of the guy's head?

00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,172
Fuse line.

00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,174
Dynamite.

00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:52,456
( <i>coughing</i> )

00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,299
GRISSOM:
Chest wound.

00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:05,317
Possibly from our .38.
Looks about 2days old.

00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:10,741
Joe McPherson.

00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,376
Local.

00:35:12,984 --> 00:35:14,619
Mr. MIA.

00:35:18,526 --> 00:35:21,942
You know, wooden support beams,
fuse line,

00:35:21,942 --> 00:35:25,500
TNT...

00:35:25,566 --> 00:35:28,484
I think, uh, Alex James
was trying to hide this body

00:35:28,484 --> 00:35:30,386
in the back of his mine.

00:35:30,453 --> 00:35:31,484
McPHERSON:
You scammed me.

00:35:31,484 --> 00:35:31,942
JAMES:
No.

00:35:31,942 --> 00:35:33,817
That was my
life savings.

00:35:33,817 --> 00:35:34,951
Take it easy.

00:35:35,018 --> 00:35:36,353
Listen, now-now,
now, lookit.

00:35:36,419 --> 00:35:38,088
I-I, I can explain everything,
all right?

00:35:38,154 --> 00:35:39,456
Listen, Joe.

00:35:39,522 --> 00:35:40,457
Joe, come on,

00:35:40,523 --> 00:35:41,624
I-I sold you
the wrong mine.

00:35:41,691 --> 00:35:43,693
I-It's
an honest mistake.

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,961
You're a liar!

00:35:45,028 --> 00:35:47,097
( <i>grunting</i> )

00:35:47,163 --> 00:35:49,165
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:59,209
( <i>panting</i> )

00:36:02,045 --> 00:36:04,214
GRISSOM:
<i>Like most fuses,</i>
<i>it probably burnt too quickly</i>

00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,749
<i>and he couldn't outrun</i>
<i>the blast.</i>

00:36:05,815 --> 00:36:08,418
( <i>yelling</i> )

00:36:08,485 --> 00:36:10,887
Or the wooden stake.

00:36:41,942 --> 00:36:43,687
Okay.

00:36:43,753 --> 00:36:45,588
Sample from the kennel
is on your right.

00:36:45,655 --> 00:36:46,923
Your bear is on the left.

00:36:54,197 --> 00:36:56,866
Visible match.

00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:08,311
( <i>knocking at door</i> )

00:37:09,512 --> 00:37:10,914
Bridget Willis?

00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,416
Las Vegas police.

00:37:20,757 --> 00:37:22,992
Tramelle, where's
your mother?

00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:23,817
I don't know.

00:37:23,817 --> 00:37:25,252
She left with my sister.

00:37:25,318 --> 00:37:26,653
She said my daddy

00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,655
would come get me.

00:37:29,689 --> 00:37:31,157
BRASS:
She's not here.

00:37:31,224 --> 00:37:33,193
I'll put out
an APB.

00:37:41,835 --> 00:37:44,471
So, Tavian was paying
Bridget child support--

00:37:44,538 --> 00:37:45,739
three grand a month.

00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,607
Three grand a month?

00:37:47,674 --> 00:37:51,478
Tavian Tombs has been
a $12 million-a-year player

00:37:51,545 --> 00:37:52,946
for eight seasons,

00:37:53,013 --> 00:37:56,383
not including endorsements.

00:37:56,449 --> 00:37:58,218
Well, he made his deal
with Bridget

00:37:58,285 --> 00:37:59,452
when Tramelle was born.

00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:01,067
Bad timing for her.

00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:02,651
Motive for us.

00:38:02,718 --> 00:38:03,685
She was right to assume

00:38:03,752 --> 00:38:05,787
that Tavian would immediately
pay that ransom.

00:38:05,854 --> 00:38:08,524
What's five million to a guy
who makes hundreds of millions?

00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,234
And it is his son.

00:38:09,234 --> 00:38:11,036
I'm sure he would have paid
any amount.

00:38:11,103 --> 00:38:12,905
So, how does that

00:38:12,971 --> 00:38:15,526
dog kennel guy Price
figure into all this,

00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:18,195
and was killing him
part of the plan?

00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:19,363
I don't know.

00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,317
I think that Bridget Willis
killed him

00:38:21,317 --> 00:38:23,018
because he killed Isaiah.

00:38:23,085 --> 00:38:26,088
( <i>yelling</i> )

00:38:26,155 --> 00:38:29,091
( <i>dog barking</i> )

00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:34,859
In her act of redemption,
she gives Tramelle to Tavian.

00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:29,000
Come here.

00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:38,067
Hello, Tramelle.

00:39:38,274 --> 00:39:39,269
Hi.

00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,586
Okay.

00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:50,822
According to Greg, the
blood on the bullet's

00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,490
a direct match
to Joe McPherson.

00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:53,925
It's a done deal.

00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,026
You know,
I was talking to a lady

00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:56,026
in the County
Records Office.

00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:58,276
She said those land patents
have been changing hands

00:39:58,276 --> 00:39:59,311
for over 50 years.

00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:01,076
That figures.

00:40:01,143 --> 00:40:02,811
There's a sucker
born every minute.

00:40:02,878 --> 00:40:06,825
Yup, and they all
come to Vegas.
