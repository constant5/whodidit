1:00 AM and 2:00 AM.

00:02:34,617 --> 00:02:35,952
Then he left them

to the crap table.

00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,589

an hour later

00:02:39,655 --> 00:02:43,192

with her throat slashed.

No.

to know, but I got creeped out.

That's all you did?

00:04:29,298 --> 00:04:31,534
Well, I did ask her who did it.

00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:35,004

The forensic sample matches
the reference.

was definitely the victim's.

is still at large

I'm only done processing
half the evidence.

You're going to have
to call in help

00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:19,479
because if the judge thinks
that our evidence

00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:20,614
isn't strong enough
to go to trial

00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:22,015
he's going to dismiss
the charges on Tom.

00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,183
Can't the DA
drop the charges

00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,319
and we'll refile
when we get our
evidence together?

00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:27,287
Sure, but the odds are

00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:29,289
that Tom will relocate to Europe

00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:30,591

As soon as it's processed

00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,036
they'll get a copy
of our report.

00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:45,205
They're entitled to see it

Well, when you can't attack
the evidence itself

00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,846
you attack the method
of gathering the evidence.

00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:10,808
(<i>woman screaming</i>)

00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,211
(<i>ripping sound;</i>
<i>screaming stops</i>)

00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:16,714
She was collateral damage.

00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,216
My guess...

00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,451
these blood patterns mean
that Tonya's dead.

00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,122
And I bet she was
the first to die.

00:19:24,188 --> 00:19:25,456
Rage killing.

00:19:25,523 --> 00:19:27,792
<i>Sudden hand-to-hand combat.</i>

00:19:29,027 --> 00:19:30,528
I'll get all this to Greg

00:19:30,595 --> 00:19:32,697
but we are definitely
going to need

00:19:32,764 --> 00:19:34,032
the DNA guy from days

00:19:34,098 --> 00:19:35,900
to pull all this
together in time.

00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,235
Sorry, Gil.

00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,604
Just doing my job.

00:19:40,939 --> 00:19:42,540
Sara, this is
Dr. Gerard.

00:19:42,607 --> 00:19:44,075
Anything you
say to him

00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:46,077
will be considered
testimony.

00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:47,545
Then, hopefully, you'll say

00:19:47,612 --> 00:19:49,781
I'm better-looking
than I appear on TV.

00:19:49,847 --> 00:19:52,216
You're the CSI who recovered
the clothes

00:19:52,283 --> 00:19:53,718
from the crime scene.

00:19:53,785 --> 00:19:55,086
Yes, and the bedsheets.

00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,422
Did you follow
departmental procedures--

00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:00,658
transporting this evidence
back to the lab?

00:20:00,725 --> 00:20:02,627
To the letter.

00:20:02,694 --> 00:20:05,129
Took multiple photos
at the scene?

00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:07,131
Our protocols stipulate
we take overalls

00:20:07,198 --> 00:20:08,499
locator shots and close-ups.

00:20:08,566 --> 00:20:09,767
I took multiples of each.

00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,069
That's great.

00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,137
Save your gloves from the scene?

00:20:13,204 --> 00:20:15,673
Eight pair in the evidence room,
in a sealed envelope.

00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,908
Terrific.

00:20:16,975 --> 00:20:20,678
DA just provided me
with copies of pictures

00:20:20,745 --> 00:20:22,480
of the victim's bra.

00:20:22,547 --> 00:20:24,515
Well, we already know
the bra was moved.

00:20:24,582 --> 00:20:26,985
Sara filed a supplemental
report to that effect.

00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:28,019
I know.

00:20:28,086 --> 00:20:30,788
I wish she'd mentioned
her relationship

00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:33,157
with the EMT who moved the bra.

00:20:34,892 --> 00:20:36,494
Relationship?

00:20:36,561 --> 00:20:38,129
A Hank Peddigrew.

00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:40,131
We just interviewed him.

00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:44,135
He says he thanked her for
letting him move the bra back.

00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:45,737
He was just, uh, being polite

00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:47,538
and, um, it's not
a relationship.

00:20:47,605 --> 00:20:48,539
We go to movies...

00:20:48,606 --> 00:20:49,474
Doc?

00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,010
Why don't you and I
go to my office.

00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:53,011
We can talk there.

00:20:53,077 --> 00:20:54,078
Thank you.

00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:00,585
I'll get the blood swatches
to DNA

00:21:00,652 --> 00:21:03,021
identify any additional donors
on the sheet.

00:21:06,124 --> 00:21:08,993
TV REPORTER:
When asked about the murder
of Kim Hsu

00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,695
a spokesman for Tom Haviland
says

00:21:10,762 --> 00:21:13,564
he sends his condolences
to the Hsu family.

00:21:13,631 --> 00:21:17,135
Certainly, this is an event
that he won't soon forget

00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:19,037
and neither will the resort

00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:21,306
where the grisly crime
played out.

00:21:21,372 --> 00:21:23,308
Now it's up to prosecutors...

00:21:23,374 --> 00:21:24,642
Catherine?

00:21:24,709 --> 00:21:27,378
Marjorie's requesting copies

00:21:27,445 --> 00:21:31,950
of CSI's proficiency test
records, by midnight.

00:21:32,016 --> 00:21:33,651
So relax.
If any of us had failed

00:21:33,718 --> 00:21:36,321
the yearly proficiency test,
we wouldn't be here.

00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,325
You completely forget,
don't you?

00:21:40,391 --> 00:21:41,993
My test is on appeal.

00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:43,484
Oh, right.

00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:45,186
Board said I was wrong
on one question.

00:21:45,253 --> 00:21:48,189
I said the question was
ambiguous.

00:21:48,256 --> 00:21:50,792
They're going to rule my way

00:21:50,858 --> 00:21:53,528
but not before the prelim.

00:21:53,594 --> 00:21:55,063
(<i>sighs</i>)

00:21:55,129 --> 00:21:58,066
Just trying to rattle me.

00:21:58,132 --> 00:21:59,701
Is it working?

00:22:00,835 --> 00:22:03,471
Maybe I should just take a page
out of your book.

00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:05,606
If I don't collect or analyze
anything

00:22:05,673 --> 00:22:06,975
I don't have to testify.

00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,243
Of course, it helps

00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,445
to be boss.

00:22:10,511 --> 00:22:11,879
Very politic.

00:22:11,946 --> 00:22:15,516
Ecklie must be rubbing off
on you.

00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,018
Yeah, that's it.

00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,488
Ecklie.

00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:25,293
I just got served.

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,195
Movie star's lawyer
wants the shirt

00:22:27,261 --> 00:22:28,896
that I wore
to the crime scene.

00:22:28,963 --> 00:22:30,264
So give it to him.

00:22:30,331 --> 00:22:31,499
I had to throw it out.

00:22:31,566 --> 00:22:32,967
Why?
It was covered
in the blood

00:22:33,034 --> 00:22:34,802
from the accident victim.

00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:36,104
Well, you have to find it

00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,339
otherwise, it'll look like
you've got something to hide.

00:22:38,406 --> 00:22:40,241
Oh, CSI's on trial now?

00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:41,959
CSI's always on trial, Warrick;
you know this.

00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:44,328
Burden of proof is on us.

00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:51,135
(<i>keyboard clacking</i>)

00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:00,944
I want to compliment you
on how quickly

00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:03,614
you've organized
the video forensics.

00:23:10,154 --> 00:23:11,889
(<i>keyboard clacking</i>)

00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:18,228
Raymond.

00:23:22,766 --> 00:23:25,102
Nicky, wait a minute.
Go back.

00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:28,338
Freeze it on the sticks.

00:23:32,142 --> 00:23:34,845
He's jammed a lot more clubs
into that bag.

00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,680
Without those clubs,
the hard-shell bag

00:23:36,747 --> 00:23:38,782
could be big enough
to fit a body.

00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:40,184
Yeah, Tonya's.

00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,654
Looks like Raymond was disposing
of the bodies for your client.

00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,390
You think he ran out of time
before he could move Kim's out?

00:23:46,456 --> 00:23:49,193
Or Ray was disposing of them
for himself.

00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:50,961
You've just supplied
Tom Haviland

00:23:51,028 --> 00:23:52,930
with reasonable doubt.

00:23:52,996 --> 00:23:54,398
No. What I showed you
on video

00:23:54,465 --> 00:23:56,333
is Ray in the casino

00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,204
during the time
the murders were committed.

00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,639
His zeal is clouding
his judgment.

00:24:02,706 --> 00:24:05,642
It's not what <i>did</i> happen;

00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:08,579
it's what the jury will believe
<i>could</i> have happened.

00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,996
Very considerate of you
to bring this golf bag in

00:24:26,063 --> 00:24:27,631
without insisting
on a warrant.

00:24:27,698 --> 00:24:28,917
Ray wants to help
the investigation

00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:30,118
in any way he can.

00:24:30,184 --> 00:24:32,086
BRASS:
Tell me, counselor

00:24:32,153 --> 00:24:34,289
does Tom Haviland pay
in a timely fashion?

00:24:34,355 --> 00:24:35,857
Ray and Tom are friends

00:24:35,924 --> 00:24:39,294
but we're just looking
for the truth here,
aren't we?

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,162
Great. Then you
can confirm

00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:44,766
what we already know from
Ray's cell phone records:

00:24:44,832 --> 00:24:47,735
Tom Haviland called you
to his suite at 1:31 a.m.

00:24:47,802 --> 00:24:50,104
to help him clean up
his double murder.

00:24:50,171 --> 00:24:52,206
No, he called
so I could hear him

00:24:52,273 --> 00:24:53,374
with the girls.

00:24:53,441 --> 00:24:55,476
He does that sometimes.

00:24:55,543 --> 00:24:57,278
Okay. We have a
surveillance tape

00:24:57,345 --> 00:24:58,446
of you carrying

00:24:58,513 --> 00:25:00,648
what appears to be
one of the bodies

00:25:00,715 --> 00:25:02,750
out of the casino
an hour later

00:25:02,817 --> 00:25:05,253
in a golf bag
identical to this one.

00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,523
Here are some photos
from that tape.

00:25:10,725 --> 00:25:13,361
He was taking Mr. Haviland's
clubs to the airport.

00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:16,264
He's dumping a body.

00:25:16,331 --> 00:25:17,599
And as we speak

00:25:17,665 --> 00:25:19,400
the Police Department
is out looking for it.

00:25:23,905 --> 00:25:25,039
Solvent.

00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,342
This bag's
just been cleaned.

00:25:30,578 --> 00:25:33,414
(<i>spray bottle squirting</i>)

00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:43,091
Uh, Ray was caddying
a dead body.

00:25:43,157 --> 00:25:44,359
We show him this

00:25:44,425 --> 00:25:46,828
he'll rat out Tommy
Terrific in a heartbeat.

00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,867
Uh-oh.

00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:55,036
Glow's too uniform.

00:25:55,103 --> 00:25:56,304
The Luminol's
cross-reacting

00:25:56,371 --> 00:25:57,305
with the bleach.

00:25:57,372 --> 00:25:59,073
I don't believe this.

00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,576
Any blood evidence in there
has been destroyed.

00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,711
This is B.S.

00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:04,746
Man, total B.S.

00:26:04,812 --> 00:26:06,214
This guy Tom
Haviland's got blood

00:26:06,281 --> 00:26:07,148
all over his hands...
Nick...

00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:08,149
...and friends to lie
for him!

00:26:08,216 --> 00:26:10,084
This is B.S.!
Nick! Go get a soda.

00:26:18,726 --> 00:26:22,664
Marjorie's going to take him
to the cleaners.

00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,400
(<i>snaps off gloves</i>)

00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:29,125
Hey. What happened to you?

00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:31,875
You were a pioneer
in forensic science.

00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:33,166
How many bad guys
did you put away

00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:34,434
in Hamilton County?

00:26:34,501 --> 00:26:35,769
My share.

00:26:35,835 --> 00:26:38,104
How many innocent men have
been locked away since then

00:26:38,171 --> 00:26:39,439
because of sloppy
investigating

00:26:39,506 --> 00:26:40,440
shortcut forensics?

00:26:40,507 --> 00:26:41,941
You look for mistakes
in any lab

00:26:42,008 --> 00:26:43,109
you'll find them.

00:26:43,176 --> 00:26:44,511
I shouldn't be able to, Gil.

00:26:44,577 --> 00:26:45,679
Humans are fallible.

00:26:45,745 --> 00:26:47,447
Not this fallible--
compromised blood

00:26:47,514 --> 00:26:48,448
sweetheart deals...

00:26:48,515 --> 00:26:49,616
No, no, no, no.

00:26:49,683 --> 00:26:51,117
You're subverting
good evidence.

00:26:51,184 --> 00:26:52,452
These are good people.

00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:54,621
The accused is entitled
to the best defense possible.

00:26:54,688 --> 00:26:56,389
The accused is
entitled, yeah.

00:26:56,456 --> 00:26:58,992
He's a movie star,
that's <i>why</i> he's entitled.

00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:00,293
He's killed two women.

00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,561
You know it.

00:27:01,628 --> 00:27:03,496
But you're willing
to decimate these CSIs

00:27:03,563 --> 00:27:06,132
so that you can spoon-feed
a jury into letting him walk?

00:27:06,199 --> 00:27:08,868
A jury believes me
because of my reputation

00:27:08,935 --> 00:27:10,303
just like they do you.

00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,838
The difference is, Philip

00:27:11,905 --> 00:27:13,273
I get the same paycheck

00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,241
regardless of what
I testify to.

00:27:15,308 --> 00:27:17,577
(<i>sighs</i>)

00:27:17,644 --> 00:27:20,547
I'm saying this as a friend.

00:27:20,613 --> 00:27:22,708
For the reputation
of CSI

00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:26,345
tell the DA to drop this,
refile down the road.

00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,349
What about the
victims' families?

00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:31,784
Who's <i>their</i> friend?

00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:37,890
My guys will see you in court.

00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:00,513
Psst, Grissom.

00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:03,883
(<i>speaking quietly</i>):
We got a development.

00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:06,318
I went over those swatches
that Sara gave me

00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:07,453
from the bed sheet.

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,555
Are you whispering?

00:28:09,622 --> 00:28:12,692
I don't want that Gerard guy
to hear me.

00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:14,727
Well, he's not
here, so stop it.

00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:16,929
What's, uh, going on?

00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:20,599
Well, um...
I was testing those swatches

00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:23,469
that Sara gave me,
and three of the swatches

00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:25,371
came up Kim.

00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:28,040
The other four,
with the spatter

00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:30,242
Amelogenin results are XY.

00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:31,977
Blood's from a male?

00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:32,945
Tom Haviland's.

00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:33,946
No.

00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:35,147
And not his friend Ray's,
either.

00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,950
There was another guy
in that room.

00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:38,951
That's-That's great.

00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:40,286
The defense has us
moving so fast

00:28:40,353 --> 00:28:42,121
we can't make sense
of our own evidence.

00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:43,656
That's what they want.

00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:45,558
Should we call the DA
and let him know?

00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:46,726
Tell him what?

00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:49,462
That we might have found
a motive for the movie star?

00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:51,397
Motive.
What are you talking about?

00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:53,065
STOKES:
Hey, Grissom.

00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:54,166
Brass just called.

00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,935
They found
the other victim, Tonya.

00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:58,170
Briarway Golf Course.

00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:03,876
BRASS:
Matches the description
of Tonya.

00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:07,213
Maintenance guy found her
a half an hour ago.

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,050
The golf pro says they've closed
the back nine down for months--

00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:13,552
improvements.

00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:17,123
Did, uh, Tom Haviland
ever play a boxer?

00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:20,993
Girl's face looks like
hamburger meat.

00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,497
Looks like uncontrollable rage
to me.

00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:26,365
Grissom, you might want
to come down here.

00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:27,733
Just say it, Nick.

00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,268
Beans and franks.

00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:31,037
Tonya's a man.

00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,706
Looks like
that old Hollywood saying:

00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:37,877
"Never get caught with
a dead girl or a live boy."

00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,645
So, let's see

00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,447
Tom's in bed
with what he thinks

00:29:41,514 --> 00:29:42,448
are two girls.

00:29:42,515 --> 00:29:46,385
He reaches down on one,
becomes very confused.

00:29:51,157 --> 00:29:53,059
Most guys would have
just cleared the room

00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,260
and gargled with whiskey.

00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:57,630
But movie boy, who brags
about doing his own stunts

00:29:57,697 --> 00:30:01,100
couldn't take the thought
of having a man in his bed

00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:03,002
so he freaked out.

00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:13,913
I'm just here to observe
CSI's investigating techniques.

00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,582
Well, Nick is the primary
on this.

00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:20,052
GERARD:
You're not running evidence.

00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,987
Or have you changed your mind?

00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:24,190
By the way

00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:27,760
tell your mother I say hello
next time you talk.

00:30:27,827 --> 00:30:29,161
I was so impressed

00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:31,163
that night we
all had dinner.

00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,665
The sign language

00:30:32,732 --> 00:30:34,533
how you interpreted for her.

00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,268
Fluid, didn't miss a beat.

00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,838
What'd you do,
subpoena my doctor?

00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:41,207
Knowing your genetic
predisposition for hearing loss?

00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:44,477
You've become a bottom feeder,
Philip.

00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:45,611
Your work is
dependent upon

00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:46,612
your five senses.

00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:49,281
The fact that you're
losing one of yours

00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:50,516
wouldn't bode well

00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:52,651
for any evidence
you introduced.

00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:55,654
You know, all those years
I worked for you

00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:59,658
you never got to know me
at all, did you?

00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:06,966
(<i>bird chirping</i>)

00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:24,517
(<i>woman giggling</i>)

00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:44,027
I've looked
at everything

00:31:44,094 --> 00:31:45,095
in that hotel room.

00:31:45,161 --> 00:31:46,396
Nothing matches that pattern.

00:31:46,463 --> 00:31:47,931
What about
the booking photos of Tom?

00:31:47,997 --> 00:31:49,833
Were you able to make
comparisons off those?

00:31:49,899 --> 00:31:52,001
I told Brass I needed them;
he hasn't sent me anything yet.

00:31:52,068 --> 00:31:54,137
This case is a moving target.

00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,872
I'll get ahold of Brass.

00:31:55,939 --> 00:31:57,040
You look nice.

00:31:57,107 --> 00:31:58,641
Thanks.

00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,009
Wish me luck.

00:32:00,076 --> 00:32:02,011
Sara?

00:32:02,078 --> 00:32:03,546
Whatever happens in court

00:32:03,613 --> 00:32:06,082
it's not because
you're seeing this guy.

00:32:08,184 --> 00:32:10,153
You deserve to have a life.

00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:19,462
Remember, if you get stuck

00:32:19,529 --> 00:32:20,997
just maintain
the same posture.

00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,633
If there's any adjustments,
you're seen as squirming.

00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,368
It's going
to make you look shifty.

00:32:25,435 --> 00:32:26,669
Thanks, Cath.

00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,571
You know, I've
done this before.

00:32:28,638 --> 00:32:30,206
Well, I've done it
longer.

00:32:31,975 --> 00:32:34,277
Hey, any luck?

00:32:36,446 --> 00:32:40,283
I've been through every Dumpster
on these premises.

00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,951
Better keep looking.

00:32:47,023 --> 00:32:49,292
BAILIFF:
<i>In the cause now pending</i>
<i>before this court</i>

00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:51,461
<i>do you swear to tell the truth,</i>
<i>the whole truth</i>

00:32:51,528 --> 00:32:52,695
<i>and nothing but the truth?</i>

00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:53,963
I do.

00:32:59,202 --> 00:33:00,937
(<i>no audio</i>)

00:33:07,477 --> 00:33:09,879
Please state and spell your name
for the record.

00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,948
(<i>almost inaudible</i>):
Nicholas Stokes.

00:33:12,015 --> 00:33:13,516
S-t-o-k-e-s.

00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:15,285
Pull it closer,
Mr. Stokes.

00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,689
Oh. Sorry.

00:33:19,756 --> 00:33:21,191
I'm used to the old ones.

00:33:21,257 --> 00:33:22,325
(<i>clearing throat</i>)

00:33:22,392 --> 00:33:23,560
Nicholas Stokes.

00:33:29,265 --> 00:33:30,533
Damn!
What?

00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,569
Damn, damn, damn,
I blew it.

00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:36,339
I forgot to put case identifiers
on my dice photos.

00:33:36,406 --> 00:33:37,807
Date, time and file number?

00:33:37,874 --> 00:33:39,242
Yeah.

00:33:40,743 --> 00:33:42,078
Don't look at me that way, okay?

00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,880
I wrote it down
on the evidence envelope.

00:33:43,947 --> 00:33:45,014
I had to move fast.

00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:46,749
The casino manager
wanted us out of there.

00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,018
The dice
places Tom at the murder.

00:33:49,085 --> 00:33:50,420
Victim's blood mixed

00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,756
with his saliva.

00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,958
How can we be confident
in your collection

00:33:55,024 --> 00:33:58,595
if you can't be confident
in your own documentation?

00:34:15,712 --> 00:34:17,981
This is it.

00:34:18,047 --> 00:34:20,016
You're sure
you want to go with that one?

00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,788
This is the one.

00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,823
I was sweating bullets
looking at those photos.

00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:27,824
Did the judge

00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:29,292
exclude the dice?

00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,629
No. No, just my credibility.

00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,998
Warrick Brown?

00:34:35,064 --> 00:34:37,500
Yeah, he's, uh,
he's in the men's room.

00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:39,169
We'll send him right in.

00:34:39,235 --> 00:34:42,205
Two minutes grace,
the court moves on.

00:34:42,272 --> 00:34:44,974
<i>You're telling us</i>
<i>the shirt just</i>

00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,910
disappeared?

00:34:46,976 --> 00:34:48,978
It would only prove
that I got blood on my shirt

00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,013
from an accident victim.

00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,414
That blood never came in contact

00:34:51,481 --> 00:34:53,516
with the blood evidence
that I was transporting.

00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:55,351
But we can't
verify that

00:34:55,418 --> 00:34:57,187
now, can we?

00:34:59,022 --> 00:35:01,758
Do you still have
a gambling habit?

00:35:01,825 --> 00:35:05,562
I don't see what that has to do
with this case.

00:35:05,628 --> 00:35:07,897
It goes to the character
of the witness, Your Honor.

00:35:07,964 --> 00:35:10,700
JUDGE:
I'll allow it.

00:35:10,767 --> 00:35:13,103
For the record

00:35:13,169 --> 00:35:15,705
are you addicted
to gambling?

00:35:19,008 --> 00:35:20,777
Damn!

00:35:20,844 --> 00:35:23,213
Why didn't I
see that coming?

00:35:23,279 --> 00:35:24,247
Gambling?

00:35:24,314 --> 00:35:25,548
Hey, we're all in Nevada.

00:35:25,615 --> 00:35:27,283
It's legal;
don't worry about it.

00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,718
Legal doesn't matter in there.

00:35:28,785 --> 00:35:30,620
You know the judge
is going to throw out

00:35:30,687 --> 00:35:31,888
our blood evidence, right?

00:35:31,955 --> 00:35:34,557
Truth is,
it is compromised, Warrick.

00:35:34,624 --> 00:35:35,859
The blood is fine.

00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,961
It's the methods that are dirty.

00:35:38,027 --> 00:35:39,662
WESCOTT:
For the record

00:35:39,729 --> 00:35:41,898
are you addicted
to gambling?

00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:46,636
I am.

00:35:46,703 --> 00:35:49,239
It's a low blow.

00:35:49,305 --> 00:35:51,241
Low blow.

00:35:57,714 --> 00:36:00,150
Your guys didn't get
any extended body photos?

00:36:00,216 --> 00:36:01,851
Chest, hands, arms
right there.

00:36:01,918 --> 00:36:03,987
I need lower
extremities
for comparison.

00:36:04,053 --> 00:36:06,823
Hey, Marjorie Wescott
blew in here and shut us down.

00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:08,858
She said if we wanted
full body shots

00:36:08,925 --> 00:36:11,494
we were going to have to get
a court order.

00:36:11,561 --> 00:36:12,729
So the D.A.'s working on it.

00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,030
When, between
testimony?

00:36:14,097 --> 00:36:15,298
No kidding.

00:36:15,365 --> 00:36:18,668
Meanwhile, we're presenting
half a case to a judge.

00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,307
WESCOTT:
Well, it certainly
looks posed.

00:36:26,376 --> 00:36:28,611
You date-- you and Hank.

00:36:28,678 --> 00:36:31,781
You share
a subtle communication.

00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:36,786
Did he move the bra to where
you might have wanted it?

00:36:36,853 --> 00:36:38,721
I didn't want it anywhere.

00:36:38,788 --> 00:36:41,257
I collect evidence
without emotion.

00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,393
You do get emotionally involved,
though

00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,928
with the men on your cases.

00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,896
Hank Peddigrew isn't
the first time.

00:36:46,963 --> 00:36:48,698
Excuse me?

00:36:48,765 --> 00:36:53,269
A murder investigation
at the residence of one

00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,771
Charles Renteria.

00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:57,774
Eyewitness stated
he saw you and your supervisor

00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:00,176
Gil Grissom standing
alone outside and...

00:37:00,243 --> 00:37:04,981
you were touching him
in a romantic gesture.

00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,251
I brushed chalk from his face.

00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:09,786
Is that what they're
calling it now?

00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:12,021
D.A.:
Objection,
Your Honor.

00:37:12,088 --> 00:37:13,256
Drywall dust.

00:37:13,323 --> 00:37:15,024
We were looking for a body.

00:37:15,091 --> 00:37:17,127
It's a fair question,
Your Honor.

00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,996
Just how far will Ms. Sidle go
on the evidence

00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:21,464
to please her
boss, Gil Grissom

00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,032
whether he returns
her attentions

00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:25,135
or not?

00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,606
You have
a Bachelor of Science

00:37:29,672 --> 00:37:32,509
from West Las Vegas University,
am I right?

00:37:32,575 --> 00:37:33,943
Night school, yes.

00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:35,512
And prior
to joining

00:37:35,578 --> 00:37:38,715
CSI, you worked
as an exotic dancer?

00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:41,851
That's correct.

00:37:41,918 --> 00:37:44,254
Took your clothes off
for a living.

00:37:45,688 --> 00:37:47,957
For a very good living.

00:37:48,024 --> 00:37:50,126
No doubt,
Ms. Willows.

00:37:50,193 --> 00:37:51,961
Now, you recently
failed

00:37:52,028 --> 00:37:55,131
your yearly proficiency test,
didn't you?

00:37:55,198 --> 00:37:57,200
Technically, yes,
but it's on appeal.

00:37:57,267 --> 00:37:59,102
I'm confident
that I will prevail.

00:37:59,169 --> 00:38:02,005
Did you treat this footprint
evidence the same way?

00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,206
There's the truth

00:38:03,273 --> 00:38:05,809
and then there's
your interpretation?

00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,444
No.

00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,746
But you're appealing
your test.

00:38:11,948 --> 00:38:16,920
Actions speak louder
than words.

00:38:16,986 --> 00:38:20,290
I have no further questions,
Your Honor.

00:38:20,356 --> 00:38:23,059
We are through
with this witness.

00:38:23,126 --> 00:38:25,361
Grissom...

00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,263
they're beating
our heads in.

00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,965
Judge is going
to dismiss--
you can feel it.

00:38:29,032 --> 00:38:30,934
Don't get ahead
of yourself.

00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,068
I'm not ahead of myself.

00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:33,369
I'm up there
front and center

00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,171
taking hits along
with the rest of CSI.

00:38:35,238 --> 00:38:36,906
You know, you've
turned into a really

00:38:36,973 --> 00:38:38,441
lousy leader.

00:38:38,508 --> 00:38:40,276
I need your
help, and you're

00:38:40,343 --> 00:38:42,045
on the sidelines.
Would you know

00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:44,280
where I could get
pictures of Tom Haviland?

00:38:44,347 --> 00:38:46,216
Full body shots.

00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,584
Like, uh...

00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,385
an Internet site,
or his fan club?

00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:55,692
Ah, I hid all these when I heard

00:38:55,759 --> 00:38:58,261
Gerard would be
snooping around.

00:39:06,102 --> 00:39:08,638
"Tom Haviland...

00:39:08,705 --> 00:39:11,207
"Away from the Set,
Between Films

00:39:11,274 --> 00:39:14,978
and... in Paradise."

00:39:15,044 --> 00:39:18,181
Paparazzi;
long lens.

00:39:28,358 --> 00:39:30,326
I'm going to go to court.

00:39:30,393 --> 00:39:31,861
D.A.:
The defendant's
statement

00:39:31,928 --> 00:39:33,363
is that
when he left the room

00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,265
the victims
were both alive and well.

00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,933
Now, does that statement
support

00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,234
your new evidence?

00:39:38,301 --> 00:39:39,402
No, it does not.

00:39:39,469 --> 00:39:40,503
This unique blood pattern

00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:43,339
which I'm highlighting
and resizing

00:39:43,406 --> 00:39:46,176
for the court's edification,
was made

00:39:46,242 --> 00:39:47,644
by the defendant
during the attack.

00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:54,818
Okay, thank you,
Dr. Grissom.

00:39:54,884 --> 00:39:56,886
Nothing further, Your Honor.

00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,724
(<i>no audio</i>)

00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,504
(<i>almost inaudible</i>):
Unique pattern.

00:40:14,571 --> 00:40:15,872
By what standard

00:40:15,939 --> 00:40:17,941
are you basing
this "match"?

00:40:22,412 --> 00:40:24,681
Dr. Grissom

00:40:24,747 --> 00:40:26,916
please answer the question.

00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,455
Could she repeat

00:40:32,522 --> 00:40:33,857
the question, Your Honor?

00:40:33,923 --> 00:40:36,292
JUDGE:
Ms. Wescott?

00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:38,995
(<i>almost inaudible</i>):
By what standard are you basing

00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:41,698
this "match"?

00:40:41,765 --> 00:40:43,767
One more time, please.

00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,872
(<i>almost inaudible</i>):
By what standard

00:40:48,938 --> 00:40:50,206
are you basing

00:40:50,273 --> 00:40:52,008
this "match"?

00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,410
On visual comparison.

00:40:54,477 --> 00:40:56,212
The accused

00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:58,081
has a distinct
waffle-like scar

00:40:58,148 --> 00:41:00,717
characterized
by diamond-shaped patterns

00:41:00,784 --> 00:41:01,885
on his left knee.

00:41:01,951 --> 00:41:04,687
WESCOTT:
So, Tom has a scar
on his leg.

00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:06,689
Whoop-de-do.

00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:09,692
There's no forensic database
for scars.

00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,394
It's not
a discipline.

00:41:11,461 --> 00:41:14,230
Yes, but it's unique
to the accused.

00:41:14,297 --> 00:41:16,666
He says he got
it in a stunt

00:41:16,733 --> 00:41:18,234
on his last film.

00:41:18,301 --> 00:41:20,970
According to Mr. Haviland
in his statement

00:41:21,037 --> 00:41:23,039
and I quote,
"It happened

00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,442
"when I was rappelling
down the Alps

00:41:25,508 --> 00:41:28,445
firing an AK-47
with my free hand."

00:41:28,511 --> 00:41:30,547
But he actually got it
tripping on his way

00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,681
into the wardrobe
trailer.

00:41:31,748 --> 00:41:33,049
Objection.
There's no question

00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:34,584
to the witness here, Your Honor.

00:41:34,651 --> 00:41:35,718
Your Honor, it's

00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:36,853
a preliminary hearing.

00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,987
May I?

00:41:39,355 --> 00:41:40,957
The witness may proceed.

00:41:41,024 --> 00:41:43,059
The production report

00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,829
by the Unit Production Manager
on the film that day

00:41:45,895 --> 00:41:47,897
and I quote,
"Tom Haviland slipped

00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:50,900
"on wardrobe trailer number 38,
step number two.

00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,470
"He sustained cuts to his knee

00:41:53,536 --> 00:41:55,605
"and was bandaged
by the company medic.

00:41:55,672 --> 00:41:57,273
The production was shut down
for half a day."

00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:01,744
The company medic documented it
with Polaroid photos

00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:03,546
and I have managed
to acquire

00:42:03,613 --> 00:42:04,714
step number two...

00:42:04,781 --> 00:42:08,451
from trailer 38.

00:42:08,518 --> 00:42:10,787
I think these graphics
will help explain

00:42:10,854 --> 00:42:12,956
my findings.

00:42:13,022 --> 00:42:18,128
The step, the scar...

00:42:18,194 --> 00:42:20,163
the sheet.

00:42:36,379 --> 00:42:38,081
No further questions,
Your Honor.

00:42:38,148 --> 00:42:41,184
You may be excused, Dr. Grissom.

00:42:45,088 --> 00:42:46,890
I'm binding this case
over for trial

00:42:46,956 --> 00:42:48,057
60 days from today.

00:42:48,124 --> 00:42:50,293
WESCOTT:
We'd like a continuance,
Your Honor.

00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,895
I'll take it under submission.

00:42:51,961 --> 00:42:54,998
Gil... good work.

00:42:55,064 --> 00:42:56,833
My team did it, Philip.

00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,735
I got good CSIs.

00:42:58,802 --> 00:43:01,938
Oh, and, uh, my
mother says hello.

00:43:02,005 --> 00:43:03,039
JUDGE:
Bailiff?

00:43:03,106 --> 00:43:03,917
WESCOTT:
I'd like
to make a motion

00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:05,418
for a bail hearing,
Your Honor.

00:43:05,485 --> 00:43:07,320
JUDGE:
It's a double murder,
Counselor.

00:43:07,387 --> 00:43:09,291
Request for bail
is denied.

00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:10,225
The accused

00:43:10,292 --> 00:43:13,028
is remanded
into custody

00:43:13,095 --> 00:43:18,567
of County Jail.
