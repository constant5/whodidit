Rajeeb Khandelwahl,
trying to get away.

00:02:04,784 --> 00:02:05,718
So, they pull him out

00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,121
and they beat him up.

00:02:08,187 --> 00:02:10,156
I mean, they...
they beat him up bad.

00:02:10,223 --> 00:02:12,558
He's on his way
to Desert Palm.

the cab off the kid.

Yeah, but I supervised.

My high school

00:03:18,976 --> 00:03:20,111
used to say

00:03:20,177 --> 00:03:21,645
that your small
and large intestines

00:03:21,712 --> 00:03:23,414
could stretch across
the Brooklyn Bridge.

00:03:23,481 --> 00:03:24,415

Good plan.

Crossing the street.

00:03:59,393 --> 00:04:01,041
I don't think
he saw the cab.

00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,344
Did the cabbie see him?

00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:06,583
No, he was looking at me.

all the way out here?

but it was too late.

And that's when Rajeeb,
the taxi driver

00:04:16,526 --> 00:04:18,461
tried to leave,
to drive away?

00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:19,462
No, no, no, no.

00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:22,232
He got out of the cab
to see what happened

00:04:22,299 --> 00:04:24,200
and... then he freaked
and he got back in

00:04:24,267 --> 00:04:25,602
and he reached
for his radio.

00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:28,104
That's when the guys
attacked him.

and it happened so fast.

00:04:56,333 --> 00:05:00,604
He was just begging
for his life.

00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,773
I couldn't see
their faces

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,308

all of them.

00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,710

The damn cabbie!

00:05:11,581 --> 00:05:12,716
Why, because he's
not from Vegas?

00:05:12,782 --> 00:05:14,651
No, because he's not from here,
this country.

00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:17,120
Oh, and you know
that because you saw
his birth certificate?

00:05:17,187 --> 00:05:18,455
We didn't exactly need
to see it.

00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:19,656
Tell me what you did see.

00:05:19,723 --> 00:05:20,724
He hit the boy.

00:05:23,026 --> 00:05:24,194
Then he hits his brakes,
and I figured

00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,729
he's going to stop
and do the right thing.

00:05:25,795 --> 00:05:26,997
Instead, he jumps
back into his cab.

00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:32,469
Hey! If it weren't for us,
he'd have gotten away.

00:05:32,535 --> 00:05:33,503

About the body.

No pedestrian fracture.

there's certain expected wounds
in his lower extremities

the pedestrian fracture.

His tibia's intact.

In fact, there's no bruising
to the lower extremities.

00:08:30,413 --> 00:08:32,983

no bruising.

Well, he would've
died anyway.

Clean incised wound

00:09:00,277 --> 00:09:01,711
to the abdomen.

00:09:01,778 --> 00:09:03,713
Five inches deep.

00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,256
So how much time elapsed
between when he was stabbed

00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:15,058
and when he encountered
the taxi?

00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,127
I can't give you
an exact time frame

00:09:17,193 --> 00:09:19,362
except to say it
wasn't immediate...

00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:21,798
and before you ask,
we don't have an ID

00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:23,300
but Missing Persons called.

00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:26,636
A woman called and
said her son never
came home last night.

00:09:26,703 --> 00:09:29,406
She's on her way in.

00:09:47,357 --> 00:09:49,092
You know you
pulled me away

00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,927
from a forensic
anthropology
seminar, right?

00:09:50,994 --> 00:09:52,095
It's required.

00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:54,130
It's part of the continuing
education program.

00:09:54,197 --> 00:09:56,666
Well, I'm sorry,
but everyone seems
to have something to do today.

00:09:56,733 --> 00:09:58,902
I have a teenager
who was run over by a taxi.

00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:01,171
He wasn't hit by it;
that's not what killed him.

00:10:01,237 --> 00:10:02,439
He was stabbed, fatally.

00:10:02,505 --> 00:10:04,174
For now, I have no ID,
no suspects

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,642
and no primary crime scene.

00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:07,110
I need you.

00:10:09,946 --> 00:10:11,982
How can I help?

00:10:44,848 --> 00:10:46,750
Hey, Grissom?

00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:54,457
The directionality
of this drop

00:10:54,524 --> 00:10:56,459
is facing the boulevard.

00:10:56,526 --> 00:10:58,295
I think your victim
was bleeding

00:10:58,361 --> 00:10:59,963
before he crossed
the street.

00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,548
Blood trail.

00:11:18,615 --> 00:11:20,617
Want to go for a walk?

00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:38,201
( <i>camera shutter clicking</i> )

00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:34,917
SIDLE:
Blood leads into the grass.

00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:36,218
Trail's obscured.

00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:39,625
Okay.

00:12:41,542 --> 00:12:43,410
So, where do we pick up
the trail?

00:12:45,345 --> 00:12:48,882
Well, vic's in his teens...

00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:51,451
Probably wasn't
on the playground.

00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,823
My money's
on the basketball court.

00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,778
He crossed Lake Mead Boulevard
at 8:15

00:13:17,845 --> 00:13:19,379
and it gets dark at 5:00.

00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:20,848
He was here after dark.

00:13:20,914 --> 00:13:22,349
And I don't see any lights.

00:13:34,461 --> 00:13:36,563
Droplets and castoff.

00:13:40,234 --> 00:13:42,803
This is our primary
crime scene.

00:13:46,773 --> 00:13:50,244
So, maybe the killer
tossed the knife.

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,282
It's a big dump site.

00:13:55,349 --> 00:13:56,984
Yeah.

00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,586
I'll, uh,
order up some scent dogs...

00:13:59,653 --> 00:14:01,421
get some uniforms.

00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:10,364
That's him.

00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,765
That's my boy.

00:14:11,832 --> 00:14:13,400
I'm so sorry.

00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:15,736
How did something
like this happen?

00:14:15,802 --> 00:14:17,771
He's only 14 years old.

00:14:17,838 --> 00:14:20,374
Mrs. Branson, I'm afraid
you'll have to talk

00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,608
with the detectives.

00:14:21,675 --> 00:14:23,577
Hey, Sara.

00:14:23,644 --> 00:14:25,445
Hey.

00:14:25,512 --> 00:14:26,747
You working that case

00:14:26,813 --> 00:14:29,383
where some mob beat up
an Indian cab driver

00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:30,551
for hitting a kid?

00:14:30,617 --> 00:14:32,352
Cabbie didn't actually
hit the kid.

00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:34,188
He was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

00:14:34,254 --> 00:14:36,123
You think
it was racially motivated?

00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,591
Yeah, I do.

00:14:37,658 --> 00:14:40,327
White mob, white kid,
dark-skinned cabbie--

00:14:40,394 --> 00:14:41,762
I don't like the math.

00:14:41,828 --> 00:14:42,863
Yeah.

00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,164
We got to wait

00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:45,465
for the science, don't we?

00:14:45,532 --> 00:14:48,335
I'm trying.

00:14:48,402 --> 00:14:51,305
That's the job.

00:14:51,371 --> 00:14:52,539
Good luck.

00:14:56,577 --> 00:14:59,613
Captain, there's a Mrs. Branson
here to see you.

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,648
Oh good.
Send her in, Joe. Thanks.

00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:03,851
Mrs. Branson, thank you
for coming in...

00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:05,352
Have you arrested
that taxi driver?

00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:06,587
He's in intensive care.

00:15:06,653 --> 00:15:07,955
How did he not
see my son?

00:15:08,021 --> 00:15:09,323
That's a well-lit intersection.

00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:10,390
My son is five foot six!

00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:13,026
Please, Mrs. Branson...
please, sit down.

00:15:13,093 --> 00:15:15,095
Um...

00:15:15,162 --> 00:15:16,430
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:15:16,496 --> 00:15:18,465
Your son was stabbed
in Haskell Park

00:15:18,532 --> 00:15:19,967
and you live
on Loring Avenue.

00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:22,202
My best guess is that
he was on his way home

00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:23,604
when the accident occurred.

00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,838
No, I don't understand.

00:15:24,905 --> 00:15:26,807
The taxi didn't kill your son

00:15:26,874 --> 00:15:28,942
but someone did.

00:15:31,778 --> 00:15:35,015
Did Todd have any problems
that you're aware of?

00:15:35,082 --> 00:15:37,417
Did he have any problems
at school?

00:15:37,484 --> 00:15:38,886
No, no, nothing like that.

00:15:38,952 --> 00:15:40,420
He's a... he's a great kid.

00:15:40,487 --> 00:15:42,256
He's-He's athletic.
He's popular.

00:15:42,322 --> 00:15:43,991
He's, uh, he's a good student.

00:15:44,057 --> 00:15:46,627
We-We moved here from Portland
nine months ago.

00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:47,961
He fit right in.

00:15:48,028 --> 00:15:49,263
Did you know
he was in the park

00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:51,031
after sundown?
No.

00:15:51,098 --> 00:15:52,966
I thought he was at
a friend's for dinner.

00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:55,302
He was supposed
to call me, but
you know teenagers.

00:15:55,369 --> 00:15:57,604
Yeah, I do...

00:15:57,671 --> 00:16:01,608
and they don't often confide
in their parents, I know.

00:16:03,844 --> 00:16:05,245
Uh, I've been on the run

00:16:05,312 --> 00:16:06,680
from my
ex-husband.

00:16:06,747 --> 00:16:09,449
He's threatened to
kill me and my boys.

00:16:09,516 --> 00:16:12,519
I just try and stay
one step ahead of him.

00:16:12,586 --> 00:16:14,254
When was the last time
you saw him?

00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:15,255
In Portland.

00:16:15,322 --> 00:16:17,624
He showed up outside
of Todd's school.

00:16:17,691 --> 00:16:20,360
The boys and I were
on a bus that evening.

00:16:20,427 --> 00:16:24,264
You know, a couple days
ago, the phone rang.

00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:25,632
I answered it.

00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:26,833
It was him.

00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,835
I don't know how
he found us here

00:16:28,902 --> 00:16:32,206
but this weekend,
the boys and I were
going to disappear.

00:16:32,272 --> 00:16:34,074
Why didn't you call
the police?

00:16:38,545 --> 00:16:41,515
Because you knew
we couldn't protect you.

00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:49,690
( <i>murmurs indistinctly</i> )

00:17:14,748 --> 00:17:17,718
( <i>metal detector humming</i> )

00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:20,387
( <i>humming continues</i> )

00:17:28,262 --> 00:17:30,464
SIDLE:
What have you got?

00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:32,833
You got the gloves on.

00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:47,781
Looking for a knife;
uncover a gun.

00:17:47,848 --> 00:17:50,484
What is happening
to our parks?

00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:51,552
( <i>howling</i> )

00:17:58,392 --> 00:18:00,294
Officer...

00:18:02,963 --> 00:18:04,464
Back the dogs
off, please.

00:18:13,507 --> 00:18:16,543
Dead body found 20 yards
from where our vic was knifed.

00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,011
You think
they're related?

00:18:18,078 --> 00:18:20,647
Well they're related
by geography...

00:18:20,714 --> 00:18:22,416
but for now

00:18:22,482 --> 00:18:24,518
it's just a dead guy
in the park.

00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,434
Hey.

00:18:51,501 --> 00:18:52,435
Hey.

00:18:52,502 --> 00:18:54,004
I thought you had
a couple days off?

00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,605
I do, but I left these
on my desk.

00:18:55,672 --> 00:18:57,040
I'm on my way
to Circus Circus

00:18:57,107 --> 00:18:58,275
with five nine-year-olds.

00:18:58,341 --> 00:18:59,476
It's Lindsey's birthday.

00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:00,677
Got to wrap
a Bridal Barbie.

00:19:00,744 --> 00:19:01,678
What's a Bridal Barbie?

00:19:01,745 --> 00:19:03,747
Funny.

00:19:03,813 --> 00:19:06,016
Oh, blue...
gun shot residue.

00:19:06,082 --> 00:19:08,084
On our stabbing
victim's jacket.

00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:10,320
So it means that he may have
fired the revolver

00:19:10,387 --> 00:19:12,389
that you and Grissom
found in the park?

00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:19,195
Yeah. Too bad GSR testing
can't tie the vic
to a particular gun.

00:19:19,262 --> 00:19:21,331
Right.

00:19:21,398 --> 00:19:23,967
Hmm... but maybe Grissom can.

00:19:24,034 --> 00:19:24,968
Grissom?

00:19:25,035 --> 00:19:26,336
Yeah, I just passed him
in Ballistics.

00:19:26,403 --> 00:19:28,438
He was meditating
on your revolver.

00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:29,439
Didn't even look up.

00:19:29,506 --> 00:19:30,440
Excuse me.

00:19:30,507 --> 00:19:31,441
Mm-hmm.

00:19:31,508 --> 00:19:32,442
Have fun.

00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:33,877
Thanks.

00:19:41,718 --> 00:19:44,087
You know,
you could've waited for me.

00:19:45,221 --> 00:19:46,556
Take a look at this.

00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:54,497
Looks like burnt skin.

00:19:55,932 --> 00:19:58,935
I think maybe someone palmed
the cylinder gap.

00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,142
Todd Branson had
GSR on his jacket.

00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:08,111
If we could get his
DNA off this revolver

00:20:08,178 --> 00:20:09,346
we could tie him to this.

00:20:09,412 --> 00:20:10,647
Burnt skin is useless

00:20:10,714 --> 00:20:11,715
for DNA.

00:20:11,781 --> 00:20:13,316
Yeah, but, what about sweat?

00:20:13,383 --> 00:20:15,318
There's a 17% chance
of DNA recovery

00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:17,821
from the shooter's
perspiration.

00:20:17,887 --> 00:20:19,656
17%?

00:20:19,723 --> 00:20:21,224
Yeah. New paper
out of Australia.

00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,259
You haven't seen it?

00:20:22,325 --> 00:20:24,728
17% chance
of DNA recovery

00:20:24,794 --> 00:20:27,697
from the grip of a gun,
67% chance from a cigarette

00:20:27,764 --> 00:20:31,434
32% chance from the brim
of a hat.

00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:33,236
Would you like a copy?

00:20:33,303 --> 00:20:35,505
I don't need one.

00:20:35,572 --> 00:20:36,706
I have you.

00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:40,510
Swab the pistol grip;
get it to DNA.

00:20:53,123 --> 00:20:57,060
Albert, did you notice
if Todd Branson had

00:20:57,127 --> 00:20:58,895
any burn marks
on his palms?

00:20:58,962 --> 00:21:00,664
No.

00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,198
What about this guy?

00:21:02,265 --> 00:21:03,800
Negative.
What are you looking for?

00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:05,402
A specific injury.

00:21:05,468 --> 00:21:07,737
Well, I can't help you
with burns

00:21:07,804 --> 00:21:11,241
but you'll want to check out
this guy's right palm.

00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:15,078
An incised wound.

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,616
Well, that's a common injury

00:21:19,683 --> 00:21:21,418
sustained by knife-wielding
killers.

00:21:23,587 --> 00:21:28,024
So assuming that
this is the man

00:21:28,091 --> 00:21:30,594
who stabbed Todd Branson,
what killed this guy?

00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,861
A bullet.

00:21:31,928 --> 00:21:34,864
It's lodged in
the left ventricle.

00:21:34,931 --> 00:21:37,033
I was contemplating

00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,603
my method of extraction
when you arrived.

00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:42,072
You reach in
and pull it out.

00:21:42,138 --> 00:21:44,441
Not if it's only
a jacket fragment.

00:21:44,507 --> 00:21:45,942
Maybe a
frangible bullet

00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:47,377
designed to fragment
on impact?

00:21:47,444 --> 00:21:49,179
That would explain

00:21:49,246 --> 00:21:51,648
the mystery of
the shattered femur.

00:21:51,715 --> 00:21:54,718
It's covered
in copper dust.

00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:04,494
I'll remove the heart,
peel back the myocardium

00:22:04,561 --> 00:22:06,896
and get you what's left
of that bullet.

00:22:09,032 --> 00:22:12,269
Did he have
a dislocated shoulder?

00:22:12,335 --> 00:22:16,773
Yeah, torn musculature,
but no inflammatory response.

00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,575
It happened postmortem?

00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,345
Excuse me, I'm headed over
to the hospital.

00:22:22,412 --> 00:22:24,080
Taxi driver didn't make it.

00:22:25,782 --> 00:22:27,918
Another one for my table.

00:22:27,984 --> 00:22:30,353
Emerson once said
"The mob is man

00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,057
voluntarily descending to
the nature of the beast."

00:22:34,124 --> 00:22:36,760
The beast is up for murder.

00:22:48,872 --> 00:22:51,942
Hey, buddy,
how's it going?

00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:56,880
I'm Detective Jim Brass
from Las Vegas Police.

00:22:56,947 --> 00:22:57,981
Is your mother home?

00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,115
No.

00:22:59,182 --> 00:23:01,318
What's your name?

00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:03,553
Eric.

00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,322
Sorry about your
brother, Eric.

00:23:05,388 --> 00:23:06,957
Mom's out getting more boxes.

00:23:07,023 --> 00:23:08,792
Yeah, she said that
you were moving.

00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:10,527
Where are you going to?

00:23:10,594 --> 00:23:12,996
You know, when I was a kid
we moved around a lot.

00:23:13,063 --> 00:23:14,998
It's not easy.

00:23:15,065 --> 00:23:17,300
So you're going to
be seeing your dad?

00:23:17,367 --> 00:23:19,102
My dad's dead.

00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:20,737
Died when I was two.

00:23:20,804 --> 00:23:23,506
Hey, Eric, will you
do me a favor?

00:23:23,573 --> 00:23:24,641
When you see your mom

00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:27,677
ask her to give
me a call, okay?

00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,679
Okay.

00:23:29,746 --> 00:23:31,948
Take care.

00:23:35,685 --> 00:23:36,920
Is that the frangible?

00:23:36,987 --> 00:23:38,154
Yep.

00:23:38,221 --> 00:23:40,457
These were originally used
in indoor shooting ranges

00:23:40,523 --> 00:23:42,659
where lead buildup's
a problem.

00:23:42,726 --> 00:23:44,194
Copper's less toxic
than lead.

00:23:44,261 --> 00:23:45,262
Take a look.

00:23:48,064 --> 00:23:50,567
On the left,
bullet from the vic's heart.

00:23:50,634 --> 00:23:52,836
On the right, bullet test-fired

00:23:52,903 --> 00:23:55,672
from the revolver
recovered at the scene.

00:23:55,739 --> 00:23:57,440
Oh, serendipity.
Yep.

00:23:57,507 --> 00:23:59,276
Hey.

00:23:59,342 --> 00:24:00,944
Just made a match
to your revolver.

00:24:01,011 --> 00:24:02,345
Nice.

00:24:02,412 --> 00:24:04,347
I ran the serial number
through NCIC.

00:24:04,414 --> 00:24:05,682
It's registered

00:24:05,749 --> 00:24:09,853
to a Jonathan Raurk of
San Jose, California.

00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,922
John's my ex.

00:24:11,988 --> 00:24:13,356
Is he in Las Vegas?

00:24:13,423 --> 00:24:14,624
BRASS:
Well, we, uh...

00:24:14,691 --> 00:24:16,526
we found a gun
registered to him

00:24:16,593 --> 00:24:19,396
in the park where
your son was murdered

00:24:19,462 --> 00:24:21,831
but when I spoke
to your son Eric

00:24:21,898 --> 00:24:24,968
he told me that his
father died years ago.

00:24:25,035 --> 00:24:27,837
That's what I told both my boys.

00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:31,341
I told them that John
was killed in a car accident.

00:24:31,408 --> 00:24:33,376
It's not easy
to lie to them like that

00:24:33,443 --> 00:24:36,479
but every time I move I have
to make up some crazy story.

00:24:36,546 --> 00:24:38,014
I just want them to be able

00:24:38,081 --> 00:24:39,482
to sleep at night.

00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:41,151
Ms. Branson

00:24:41,217 --> 00:24:43,420
we also found a dead
body in the park--

00:24:43,486 --> 00:24:45,822
a white male in his mid-30s.

00:24:45,889 --> 00:24:48,224
You think it's John?

00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:51,361
We have no ID,
but we have a photograph.

00:24:56,466 --> 00:24:58,201
No...

00:24:58,268 --> 00:24:59,603
No, this...

00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:00,770
This isn't John.

00:25:00,837 --> 00:25:02,072
This isn't my ex.

00:25:02,138 --> 00:25:03,340
This is Stewart.

00:25:03,406 --> 00:25:05,108
It's Stewart Bradley.

00:25:05,175 --> 00:25:06,776
He's my boyfriend.

00:26:32,796 --> 00:26:34,297
Where have you been?

00:26:34,364 --> 00:26:35,599
I went back to the park.

00:26:35,665 --> 00:26:38,335
I kept thinking
there must be some
physical evidence

00:26:38,401 --> 00:26:40,503
connecting the stabbing
to the shooting.

00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,005
GRISSOM:
Drag marks?

00:26:42,072 --> 00:26:44,040
SIDLE:
Leading from
the basketball court

00:26:44,107 --> 00:26:45,375
to Stewart Bradley's body.

00:26:45,442 --> 00:26:46,743
We know Todd was bleeding

00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,512
but there were no blood drops
around the drag marks.

00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:51,615
So you're thinking
someone else was there?

00:26:51,681 --> 00:26:54,818
Now, the revolver was registered
to the boy's biological father

00:26:54,884 --> 00:26:57,153
but they haven't seen
each other in ten years.

00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,457
Assuming Todd fired the gun,
how did he get ahold of it?

00:27:00,523 --> 00:27:04,294
Well, maybe Dad gave it to him
behind Mom's back.

00:27:04,361 --> 00:27:09,900
Or... maybe Todd
wasn't the shooter.

00:27:09,966 --> 00:27:11,334
True.

00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:14,471
Presence of GSR only places Todd
in the <i>vicinity</i> of the gunfire.

00:27:14,537 --> 00:27:17,607
And since there were no
burn marks on Todd's palms

00:27:17,674 --> 00:27:21,278
evidence is suggesting
someone else fired that gun.

00:27:21,344 --> 00:27:24,214
Which brings us
back to Dad.

00:27:24,281 --> 00:27:27,918
BRASS:
You know something, John,
you don't scare me.

00:27:27,984 --> 00:27:30,587
According to your ex-wife,
you're some kind of monster--

00:27:30,654 --> 00:27:32,055
threatening her life

00:27:32,122 --> 00:27:34,457
setting her car
on fire in Boston

00:27:34,524 --> 00:27:36,793
breaking and entering
in Chicago

00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,229
showing up at your kid's
school in Portland...

00:27:39,296 --> 00:27:40,330
I don't know, I mean

00:27:40,397 --> 00:27:42,299
I thought maybe
you'd be like the guy

00:27:42,365 --> 00:27:43,867
in <i>Sleeping</i>
<i>with the Enemy.</i>

00:27:43,934 --> 00:27:46,570
You're more like
Gumby, aren't you?

00:27:46,636 --> 00:27:48,505
Look, if this is
about my ex...

00:27:48,572 --> 00:27:50,607
cop pulled me over
outside Moapa.

00:27:50,674 --> 00:27:51,908
Jane lives in Vegas.

00:27:51,975 --> 00:27:55,045
I didn't violate any damn
court order, all right?

00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:56,413
You know where she lives.

00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:58,048
Is that a crime?

00:27:58,114 --> 00:27:59,950
Yesterday, your son Todd
was murdered

00:28:00,016 --> 00:28:01,117
and that is a crime.

00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,221
Hey!

00:28:05,288 --> 00:28:06,256
John, baby

00:28:06,323 --> 00:28:08,892
I'm not talking about
the weather here, man.

00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:11,261
I'm talking about your son.

00:28:11,328 --> 00:28:14,364
I haven't seen that kid
since he was in his diapers.

00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:16,933
Geez, I didn't kill him,
if that's where you're going to.

00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,003
Hey, what about
Stewart Bradley?

00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,739
( <i>speaking indistinctly</i> )

00:28:22,806 --> 00:28:24,641
He was shot
with your gun.

00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:26,376
Which one?

00:28:26,443 --> 00:28:28,712
Revolver. Smith &amp;amp; Wesson.

00:28:28,778 --> 00:28:30,947
No, I don't have
a Smith &amp;amp; Wesson.

00:28:31,014 --> 00:28:32,816
It's registered to you, John.

00:28:32,882 --> 00:28:33,917
Has your name on it.

00:28:33,984 --> 00:28:35,852
That got stolen.

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,154
Oh, you file a police report?

00:28:38,221 --> 00:28:40,023
But I know,
you're busy.

00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,091
You forgot. That's okay.

00:28:41,157 --> 00:28:43,260
You know what I think happened?
Here's what I think.

00:28:43,326 --> 00:28:45,495
You called up Todd,
you said, "Hey, Todd

00:28:45,562 --> 00:28:47,998
"why don't you meet me
down at Haskell Park?

00:28:48,064 --> 00:28:51,534
"You know what? Why
don't you bring Mom's
new boyfriend along?"

00:28:51,601 --> 00:28:53,703
No, no. Come on, man,
whoa, whoa, hey.

00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,038
You know what?

00:28:55,105 --> 00:28:57,507
Last night, I was
at Taos, New Mexico, okay?

00:28:57,574 --> 00:29:00,076
I didn't cross over until...

00:29:00,143 --> 00:29:01,945
it was the afternoon in Nevada.

00:29:02,012 --> 00:29:03,647
Check it out.

00:29:03,713 --> 00:29:05,282
Adobe Inn.

00:29:05,348 --> 00:29:07,284
Watched pay-per-view
and I had a pizza, okay?

00:29:08,885 --> 00:29:10,487
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:29:14,758 --> 00:29:16,459
May I see your hands,
please?

00:29:16,526 --> 00:29:18,528
You better do
what he says.

00:29:18,595 --> 00:29:20,063
He's in Crime Lab.

00:29:24,134 --> 00:29:25,201
Can you hold him?

00:29:25,268 --> 00:29:26,836
He's got some unpaid
speeding tickets.

00:29:26,903 --> 00:29:28,572
There's warrants
that have been issued.

00:29:28,638 --> 00:29:30,006
Is three days good enough?

00:29:30,073 --> 00:29:31,174
For now.

00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:49,651
What do you weigh?

00:29:49,717 --> 00:29:52,954
Uh, that's between me
and my trainer.

00:29:53,021 --> 00:29:54,088
Do I have to get a scale?

00:29:54,155 --> 00:29:56,791
A buck 95,
give or take a doughnut.

00:29:56,858 --> 00:29:58,593
Don't even ask.
I'm not telling you.

00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:01,095
Warrick, would you lie
down on the floor?

00:30:01,162 --> 00:30:02,463
I don't get paid enough

00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:03,464
to play dead.

00:30:03,531 --> 00:30:04,465
Please?

00:30:04,532 --> 00:30:05,834
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:30:07,035 --> 00:30:10,738
Sara, grab Warrick's
right arm.

00:30:10,805 --> 00:30:12,440
See if you can drag
him across the room.

00:30:12,507 --> 00:30:15,810
This does have something
to do with the case, right?

00:30:15,877 --> 00:30:17,212
You don't trust me?

00:30:20,682 --> 00:30:22,684
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:30:25,253 --> 00:30:26,254
( <i>grunts</i> )

00:30:28,857 --> 00:30:30,492
( <i>Brown groans</i> )

00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:31,860
You're such a drag.

00:30:31,926 --> 00:30:33,561
( <i>Sidle chuckles</i> )

00:30:35,763 --> 00:30:37,432
Stay there a minute.

00:30:39,367 --> 00:30:40,468
Excuse me. Hi.

00:30:40,535 --> 00:30:42,470
Judy, right?
Judy, would you

00:30:42,537 --> 00:30:44,372
like to be part of
a little experiment?

00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:45,507
I-I'm a secretary.

00:30:45,573 --> 00:30:47,175
Besides, I heard
what you did to Greg's feet.

00:30:47,242 --> 00:30:49,644
You'll keep your shoes on,
I promise.

00:30:51,212 --> 00:30:52,213
Can I get up?

00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,748
No. Spin around.

00:30:53,815 --> 00:30:56,084
Judy, would you take
Warrick by the right arm

00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:58,052
and try and drag him
across the room?

00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:59,187
Hi, Judy.

00:30:59,254 --> 00:31:00,488
Hi.

00:31:02,857 --> 00:31:04,826
( <i>grunting</i> )

00:31:04,893 --> 00:31:06,828
Hey, I like it gentle, okay?

00:31:06,895 --> 00:31:08,329
( <i>grunts</i> )

00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:13,301
Thank you, Judy.
You've been a big help.

00:31:13,368 --> 00:31:14,502
Thanks.

00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:16,337
You can go back to
the water cooler.

00:31:16,404 --> 00:31:18,506
You want to tell me
what's going on here?

00:31:18,573 --> 00:31:20,175
Stewart Bradley had

00:31:20,241 --> 00:31:22,110
a dislocated shoulder
postmortem.

00:31:22,177 --> 00:31:23,311
He's about the same
weight as you.

00:31:23,378 --> 00:31:24,345
How does your shoulder feel?

00:31:24,412 --> 00:31:26,347
You saw her dragging me around.

00:31:26,414 --> 00:31:27,949
You know, I'm glad I can help.

00:31:28,016 --> 00:31:31,286
I, uh, I'm late
for the chiropractor's.

00:31:31,352 --> 00:31:32,954
I'll send you the bill.

00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:34,189
I get it.

00:31:34,255 --> 00:31:35,590
I'm bigger than Judy.

00:31:35,657 --> 00:31:38,593
In order to get momentum,
she had to start and stop.

00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,261
Which could explain
Stewart Bradley's

00:31:40,328 --> 00:31:42,230
postmortem
dislocated shoulder.

00:31:42,297 --> 00:31:43,898
Especially if he was
dragged by somebody

00:31:43,965 --> 00:31:45,300
with limited upper
body strength.

00:31:45,366 --> 00:31:47,635
Where does that get us?

00:31:47,702 --> 00:31:50,405
Well, maybe Jan Branson.

00:31:50,471 --> 00:31:54,042
She's about Judy's size.

00:31:54,108 --> 00:31:57,445
Why would Jan Branson
shoot her boyfriend?

00:31:57,512 --> 00:31:59,013
He stabbed her son.

00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,616
Motive?

00:32:03,818 --> 00:32:05,887
I don't know.

00:32:05,954 --> 00:32:07,722
But mothers protect their
children, don't they?

00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:09,724
Okay... okay, so...

00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:13,895
she sends Todd home, not knowing
the severity of his wound.

00:32:13,962 --> 00:32:15,997
She buries
her boyfriend's body.

00:32:16,064 --> 00:32:18,466
She ditches the knife,
which we still haven't found.

00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:19,734
She hides the revolver...

00:32:19,801 --> 00:32:23,304
So perhaps the evidence
is in Mrs. Branson's hands.

00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,218
Mrs. Branson,
you got a minute?

00:32:37,285 --> 00:32:39,387
Uh, Eric and I
are leaving town.

00:32:39,454 --> 00:32:41,689
Well, your ex has
been picked up on
an unrelated matter.

00:32:41,756 --> 00:32:44,259
Even if he makes bail,
you still got a day
or two head start.

00:32:44,325 --> 00:32:45,527
Good.

00:32:45,593 --> 00:32:46,995
Ms. Branson,
may I see your hands?

00:32:47,061 --> 00:32:48,029
Excuse me?

00:32:48,096 --> 00:32:50,298
Could be important.
Palms up, please.

00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,954
Hi, pal.

00:33:13,021 --> 00:33:13,988
Hi.

00:33:14,055 --> 00:33:14,789
Hey, Eric.

00:33:14,856 --> 00:33:17,025
This is Mr. Grissom.
We work together.

00:33:17,091 --> 00:33:20,929
May I see your hands, please?

00:33:20,995 --> 00:33:22,397
We have to get going.

00:33:22,463 --> 00:33:24,165
As soon as Eric shows
Mr. Grissom his hands

00:33:24,232 --> 00:33:26,234
you're on your way.

00:33:26,301 --> 00:33:27,769
Palms up.

00:33:38,813 --> 00:33:42,283
Eric...

00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,686
I need to know
how you burned your hand.

00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:49,757
Look at Mr. Grissom, Eric.
Not your mother, okay?

00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,893
Ms. Karpell.

00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,195
Eric, it's okay to
answer the question.

00:33:54,262 --> 00:33:57,432
I burned it on an iron.

00:33:57,499 --> 00:33:59,567
BRASS:
I think something
a lot more dangerous

00:33:59,634 --> 00:34:01,302
than that burned
your hand.

00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:05,473
We recovered a gun...

00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,308
in the park.

00:34:09,511 --> 00:34:11,246
Your burn indicates
that your hand

00:34:11,312 --> 00:34:13,748
was over this gap
when the gun was fired.

00:34:13,815 --> 00:34:15,783
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:34:17,986 --> 00:34:19,687
I followed Todd to the park.

00:34:19,754 --> 00:34:22,457
Todd, I got your e-mail.
What's up?

00:34:22,524 --> 00:34:23,858
We're not moving again.

00:34:23,925 --> 00:34:25,693
I want you to tell Mom you're
passing on that promotion.

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,961
You should discuss this
with your mother.

00:34:27,028 --> 00:34:28,763
She'll do whatever you say.
You don't understand.

00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,865
I am not leaving my
friends 'cause of you!

00:34:30,932 --> 00:34:33,434
Todd, this has nothing
to do with me.

00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:35,170
Todd, no!

00:34:36,337 --> 00:34:37,872
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:34:44,212 --> 00:34:45,914
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:34:49,817 --> 00:34:50,885
Gotta get home.

00:34:50,952 --> 00:34:52,153
( <i>gun clatters</i> )

00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,188
Hide the body.

00:34:56,658 --> 00:34:58,960
I was just looking out
for my brother.

00:35:06,401 --> 00:35:08,803
I swabbed the pistol grip
of the revolver.

00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,538
The DNA from the suspect's
perspiration

00:35:10,605 --> 00:35:11,639
isn't a match to Todd's.

00:35:11,706 --> 00:35:13,741
But it is male.

00:35:13,808 --> 00:35:15,443
With eight markers
in common

00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,278
and familial relationship.

00:35:17,345 --> 00:35:20,415
GRISSOM:
We found gunshot residue

00:35:20,481 --> 00:35:21,516
on Todd's jacket.

00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:24,252
We assumed that Todd
fired the gun.

00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:26,254
But I think maybe he was
standing next to you

00:35:26,321 --> 00:35:27,822
when <i>you</i> fired the gun.

00:35:30,191 --> 00:35:33,027
You didn't go to the park
to stop Todd, did you?

00:35:33,094 --> 00:35:35,630
He went to the park
to stop <i>you.</i>

00:35:35,697 --> 00:35:38,466
Eric, what's up?

00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:40,435
TODD:
Whoa! Eric, Eric!

00:35:40,502 --> 00:35:41,870
Eric, don't be stupid.

00:35:41,936 --> 00:35:44,472
I'm not moving again!
Not 'cause of him!

00:35:46,441 --> 00:35:48,743
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,054
Go home!

00:36:02,257 --> 00:36:04,425
Where'd you get
the revolver, Eric?

00:36:05,593 --> 00:36:07,295
JAN:
From me.

00:36:12,267 --> 00:36:13,668
BRASS:
Ms. Karpell...

00:36:13,735 --> 00:36:17,205
Eric, why don't we
step out in the hall
for a few minutes.

00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:29,117
So, the gun was
in your possession

00:36:29,184 --> 00:36:30,585
and you didn't say anything.

00:36:30,652 --> 00:36:32,387
I, um...
I had it in a lock box.

00:36:32,453 --> 00:36:35,456
And, uh, when I got that call
from John a couple of days ago

00:36:35,523 --> 00:36:37,559
I took it out
and I put in my nightstand.

00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:41,763
I didn't even know it was
missing until this morning.

00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,431
And then, I thought that John

00:36:43,498 --> 00:36:45,767
must've gotten in the house
and taken it.

00:36:45,834 --> 00:36:48,837
I was so <i>sure</i> that he was
the one who killed Stewart.

00:36:48,903 --> 00:36:51,773
I've spent the
last ten years

00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,775
looking over my shoulder
every day.

00:36:53,842 --> 00:36:55,577
BRASS:
Your boyfriend was found

00:36:55,643 --> 00:36:57,645
carrying a knife
the night he died.

00:36:57,712 --> 00:37:01,182
I spoke to some of his friends
and associates, and no one <i>ever</i>

00:37:01,249 --> 00:37:03,818
remembers him
carrying a knife.

00:37:03,885 --> 00:37:06,221
SIDLE:
Ms. Branson?

00:37:06,287 --> 00:37:08,756
You warned your boyfriend about
your ex-husband, didn't you?

00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:10,191
He asked me what was wrong

00:37:10,258 --> 00:37:13,828
and I shouldn't have said
anything.

00:37:13,895 --> 00:37:15,597
He panicked.

00:37:15,663 --> 00:37:16,698
He overreacted.

00:37:16,764 --> 00:37:18,433
He started carrying a knife.

00:37:20,101 --> 00:37:22,670
What's going to happen to Eric?

00:37:22,737 --> 00:37:24,072
He'll be remanded

00:37:24,138 --> 00:37:27,275
to a juvenile detention center,
awaiting trial.

00:37:27,342 --> 00:37:28,977
And then?

00:37:29,043 --> 00:37:31,679
BRASS:
<i>If he's convicted</i>
<i>of a homicide</i>

00:37:31,746 --> 00:37:33,581
<i>he'll be sent to</i>
<i>a state custodial facility</i>

00:37:33,648 --> 00:37:36,251
<i>until he's 21.</i>

00:38:14,255 --> 00:38:15,456
Where we at, Greg?

00:38:15,523 --> 00:38:17,125
I paged you, like,
ten times.

00:38:17,192 --> 00:38:18,126
I was busy.

00:38:18,193 --> 00:38:19,828
Well, so was I.

00:38:19,894 --> 00:38:22,230
First, I processed
Mr. Khandelwhal's clothing.

00:38:22,297 --> 00:38:24,065
Then I compared the DNA

00:38:24,132 --> 00:38:26,768
I lifted from said clothing
to the DNA from

00:38:26,835 --> 00:38:28,336
the Dirty Dozen.

00:38:28,403 --> 00:38:30,772
All I see is a sheet.

00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:32,473
But what I do is art.

00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,475
And now, I'm ready
to unveil it.

00:38:36,344 --> 00:38:39,781
Welcome to the new and
improved <i>Match Game.</i>

00:38:42,517 --> 00:38:44,853
Now, Graham Cooper
grabbed Rajeeb's collar...

00:38:44,919 --> 00:38:47,355
( <i>men yelling angrily</i> )

00:38:47,422 --> 00:38:49,891
Claude Allen

00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:52,093
and Barry Lawrence
used their fists...

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,263
( <i>men clamoring</i>
<i>and blows landing</i> )

00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:58,032
Joey Gillman, Bill Kendal

00:38:58,099 --> 00:39:00,635
and Rick Midgen
got into it, too.

00:39:00,702 --> 00:39:02,203
Very nice presentation, Greg.

00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,172
What about the others?
They all participated.

00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:05,673
They even bragged about it.

00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:09,577
Well, only six of the 12 left
behind their epithelials

00:39:09,644 --> 00:39:11,913
when their skin made contact
with the vic's clothing.

00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,917
I've got no physical
evidence to tie the
others to the crime.

00:39:36,804 --> 00:39:38,773
( <i>indistinct conversation</i>
<i>echoing eerily</i> )

00:39:44,879 --> 00:39:47,015
Stop!

00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:48,983
( <i>tires screeching,</i>
<i>body thudding</i> )

00:40:01,763 --> 00:40:05,099
Hey!

00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:08,169
( <i>mob yelling</i> )

00:40:13,408 --> 00:40:15,376
GRISSOM:
<i>The mob mentality...</i>

00:40:15,443 --> 00:40:16,878
relieves individuals

00:40:16,945 --> 00:40:20,648
from having to distinguish
between right and wrong.

00:40:20,715 --> 00:40:25,253
Anonymity shields them
from prosecution, though.

00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,722
Yeah, six of them,
to be exact.

00:40:29,157 --> 00:40:33,061
Unfortunately, physical evidence
is limited by human action.

00:40:33,127 --> 00:40:37,465
Well, nothing's absolute, Gil...
even forensics.

00:40:37,532 --> 00:40:40,235
Yeah, well...

00:40:40,301 --> 00:40:43,104
this is as far
as we can take it.

00:40:43,171 --> 00:40:45,373
It's up to you guys.

00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,177
BRASS:
The physical evidence confirms
that you're the "hero"

00:40:49,244 --> 00:40:51,212
who pulled the driver
out of the cab.

00:40:51,279 --> 00:40:52,347
I'd do it again, too.

00:40:52,413 --> 00:40:54,115
Mr. Cooper,
why don't we just hear

00:40:54,182 --> 00:40:55,750
what Captain Brass has to say.

00:40:55,817 --> 00:40:57,452
You're looking at
first degree murder.

00:40:57,519 --> 00:40:58,753
What?!

00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:01,022
Mr. Khandelwhal didn't make it.

00:41:05,193 --> 00:41:07,529
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:41:07,595 --> 00:41:09,998
And, for the record,
he didn't hit that boy.

00:41:10,064 --> 00:41:11,933
He wasn't trying
to flee the scene.

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,601
He was reaching
for his radio

00:41:13,668 --> 00:41:15,203
trying to call for help.

00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,705
You know who the real
hero of this is?

00:41:17,772 --> 00:41:20,542
Rajeeb Khandelwhal.

00:41:20,608 --> 00:41:23,278
The taxi driver.

00:41:23,344 --> 00:41:25,780
So...

00:41:25,847 --> 00:41:28,149
what does that make you?

00:41:30,685 --> 00:41:32,654
D.A. willing to deal?

00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,892
( <i>heavy sigh</i> )

00:41:39,494 --> 00:41:41,696
( <i>over speaker</i> ):
We want your buddies.

00:41:41,763 --> 00:41:43,765
I mean, either you
talk or they'll talk.

00:41:43,832 --> 00:41:45,099
I mean, it doesn't matter.

00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:46,701
And the clock
is ticking, so...
