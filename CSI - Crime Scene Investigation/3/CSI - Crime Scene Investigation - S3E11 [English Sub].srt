all three of his machines

Possibly why whoever did this

00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:21,249
What makes
you think

00:10:21,316 --> 00:10:22,817
this event
happened here?

00:10:22,884 --> 00:10:25,220
We found traces
of aspic and olive oil

00:10:25,286 --> 00:10:26,654
under his fingernails.

00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:29,757
Means that he went
into the meat grinder

00:10:29,824 --> 00:10:31,059
without showering.

00:10:31,126 --> 00:10:33,661
Possibly straight
from this kitchen.

00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:35,363
If there was a murder
in our kitchen

00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,631
don't you think
that, uh...

00:10:36,698 --> 00:10:38,333
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
I'd know about it?

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,235
I don't know.
Would you?

00:10:45,774 --> 00:10:47,742
Hey, Cath?

00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:49,277
Blood spatter.

00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:50,912
It's a kitchen.
The chefs use knives.

00:10:50,979 --> 00:10:51,913
That's not uncommon.

00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,148
You are...?

00:10:53,214 --> 00:10:54,382
Gil Grissom.

00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:55,817
I'm with her.

00:10:57,986 --> 00:11:00,688
Who's, uh, Stephanie?

00:11:00,755 --> 00:11:02,390
One of my waitresses.

00:11:02,457 --> 00:11:04,959
Oh, I understand
how chefs cut their fingers

00:11:05,026 --> 00:11:07,829
and how the kitchen help
could have blood spatter

00:11:07,896 --> 00:11:09,164
on their uniforms

00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,767
but how does a waitress get
blood on the back of her shirt?

00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:17,405
We can shut you down
for hours

00:11:17,472 --> 00:11:21,342
or get a warrant
and shut you down for good.

00:11:23,745 --> 00:11:25,847
Give me till after the rush?

00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,333
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,402
Okay, this rush
is taking

00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:36,003
entirely too long.

00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,438
The <i>coquilles St. Jacques.</i>

00:11:37,505 --> 00:11:38,639
Thank you.

00:11:38,706 --> 00:11:42,010
People always think
that the show is out front.

00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,445
It wasn't till
I waitressed

00:11:44,512 --> 00:11:46,814
I realized it's
all in the back.

00:12:03,464 --> 00:12:05,400
What are you looking at?

00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:07,402
Looks like a
V-pattern to me.

00:12:07,468 --> 00:12:08,836
What do you think?

00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:11,439
Yeah.

00:12:11,506 --> 00:12:12,974
What, caused by a candle?

00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,510
Burn area seems too
big for a candle.

00:12:15,576 --> 00:12:17,478
Okay. Kitchen's all yours.

00:12:17,545 --> 00:12:21,115
Mr. Dutton, uh,
can I ask you
what happened here?

00:12:21,182 --> 00:12:22,417
Oh, geez.

00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:25,486
Uh, waiters probably put the
candles too close to the wall.

00:12:25,553 --> 00:12:27,155
I've told them
a million times.

00:12:31,826 --> 00:12:33,227
Ah, excuse me.
Stephanie?

00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,395
Uh-huh.

00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,663
Is this your uniform?

00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,865
Don't have to answer that,
Steph.

00:12:37,932 --> 00:12:39,667
They don't have a warrant.

00:12:39,734 --> 00:12:41,269
I thought you said
the Mafia left town.

00:12:41,335 --> 00:12:42,603
( <i>chuckling</i> )

00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,539
We have the owner's consent

00:12:44,605 --> 00:12:46,174
so, again,
could you explain

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,208
this blood?

00:12:48,376 --> 00:12:49,043
Order up, Stephanie.

00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,111
Hot items.

00:12:50,178 --> 00:12:53,614
Two filet mignon
and one <i>coquilles St. Jacques.</i>

00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:55,249
Boogie.
Go, go.

00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,551
WILLOWS:
Hey!

00:12:56,617 --> 00:12:58,720
We found blood spatter
on the uniforms

00:12:58,786 --> 00:13:00,288
of several employees
who worked the night

00:13:00,355 --> 00:13:02,190
that Chef Petrov died.

00:13:02,256 --> 00:13:03,958
Ross Halpo--

00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:05,159
sous chef.

00:13:05,226 --> 00:13:06,160
Lola Creighton--

00:13:06,227 --> 00:13:08,129
saucier.

00:13:08,196 --> 00:13:10,231
You want to tell us
how the blood got here?

00:13:10,298 --> 00:13:12,200
It's my blood.

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,469
We got a rule
in the kitchen:

00:13:14,535 --> 00:13:16,971
don't touch my knife;
don't touch my johnson.

00:13:21,376 --> 00:13:23,711
Hey, hey, that's my knife!

00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:25,947
Touched his knife.

00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:26,948
I deserved it.

00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,549
Okay.

00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:32,420
That still doesn't explain how
the blood got on the uniforms.

00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:33,621
They don't get it.

00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,123
Chefs here have a ritual.

00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,290
Macho thing.

00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,458
If you get cut

00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:41,129
it's tradition that
you disburse maximum spillage.

00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,196
Oh, hey, watch it.

00:13:42,263 --> 00:13:43,564
Ah, blood!

00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:45,400
Oh, hey, stop... ooh!

00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:47,668
That's how everyone
got blood on themselves.

00:13:47,735 --> 00:13:48,870
Macho.

00:13:48,936 --> 00:13:51,272
Haven't these people
ever heard of HIV?

00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:52,640
Apparently not.

00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:53,908
Alert all your employees.

00:13:53,975 --> 00:13:56,577
We're going to take over
your kitchen, starting now.

00:13:56,644 --> 00:13:59,614
Hey. You got something
on that glass?

00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:01,783
Didn't beep you to say hi.

00:14:01,849 --> 00:14:05,019
Glad to see
you're settling in, Hodges.

00:14:05,086 --> 00:14:07,055
You were right.
It is polarized.

00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:09,223
Ultraviolet quotient
is very high.

00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,225
Glass is from
a car windshield.

00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:14,862
Maybe she was in some kind
of car accident.

00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:16,631
Hit-and-run...

00:14:16,698 --> 00:14:19,200
Then she crawls home,
gets on her bed

00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:20,835
and commits hari-kari?

00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,603
Stranger things have happened.

00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,540
If you weren't such a lab rat,
you would know that.

00:14:25,606 --> 00:14:27,442
You got a make of a car for me?

00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:29,310
No.

00:14:29,377 --> 00:14:31,446
But...

00:14:31,512 --> 00:14:34,015
I can narrow it down
to the year it was manufactured.

00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:37,218
Car companies add more
ultraviolet sealants

00:14:37,285 --> 00:14:40,655
each season to stay ahead
of safety standards.

00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:42,156
Used a comparison study

00:14:42,223 --> 00:14:44,525
of a car that
was made in 2001.

00:14:46,561 --> 00:14:49,630
Your windshield glass
is from a 2002 model.

00:14:49,697 --> 00:14:50,631
Thank you.

00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:53,201
Mm-hmm.

00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,037
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,472
The windshield's intact.

00:14:57,538 --> 00:14:59,540
Yeah. Well,
maybe the glass

00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,744
came from another
windshield in this lot.

00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,479
Yeah. Let's take a look.

00:15:04,545 --> 00:15:07,582
You know, you can tell
a lot about a person

00:15:07,648 --> 00:15:09,550
by what they leave
in their car.

00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,085
Rotten bananas.

00:15:11,152 --> 00:15:12,754
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,022
Business suit.

00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:20,094
I got a paycheck.

00:15:20,161 --> 00:15:22,430
Who would do that?

00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:23,931
Underwear.

00:15:23,998 --> 00:15:25,933
( <i>chuckling</i> )

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,503
That looks like adhesive.

00:15:29,704 --> 00:15:32,140
Still tacky.

00:15:32,206 --> 00:15:33,307
WOMAN:
Hey, hey!

00:15:33,374 --> 00:15:34,308
What are you doing?

00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,677
That's my car.

00:15:35,743 --> 00:15:37,512
Crime lab.
How are you?

00:15:37,578 --> 00:15:39,414
Cute picture.
I'm late for work.

00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,149
We noticed you had your
windshield replaced recently.

00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:42,150
The adhesive's seeping.

00:15:42,216 --> 00:15:43,251
You get what you pay for.

00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,053
So the car shop was
having a half-off deal.

00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:47,055
I'm in no position
to go to the big guys.

00:15:47,121 --> 00:15:49,457
Did replacing the windshield
have anything to do

00:15:49,524 --> 00:15:50,591
with the tenant

00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,193
in apartment 325?

00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,795
Linda? Yeah.

00:15:53,861 --> 00:15:55,463
She did it.

00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:58,032
I'd send her the bill
if I thought she'd pay.

00:15:58,099 --> 00:15:59,167
She hasn't paid
for anything else

00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:00,168
she trashed in this complex.

00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:01,769
Like what else?

00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:04,105
Oh, well,
that would depend on her mood.

00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,808
Um, when she's up,
she breaks the mailboxes.

00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:10,578
When she's down

00:16:10,645 --> 00:16:12,613
she throws the patio furniture
into the pool.

00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,482
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:16:16,484 --> 00:16:17,552
She broke my
windshield yesterday

00:16:17,618 --> 00:16:19,420
because she said she heard me

00:16:19,487 --> 00:16:21,456
talking on my cell about her.

00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,591
( <i>screaming, glass breaking</i> )

00:16:23,658 --> 00:16:25,426
You bitch!
I heard you!

00:16:25,493 --> 00:16:27,895
We just call her
"the whack job in 325."

00:16:27,962 --> 00:16:29,564
Well, she died yesterday.

00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,933
We think it may have been
a suicide.

00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,635
Yeah? I'm surprised
someone didn't kill her.

00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:41,509
Look, unless you want
to call my pit boss

00:16:41,576 --> 00:16:45,580
and tell him I'm under arrest,
I'm going to work.

00:16:45,646 --> 00:16:48,449
Thank you.

00:16:48,516 --> 00:16:50,451
I would like to see
Linda Damen's tox report.

00:16:50,518 --> 00:16:52,387
Yeah.

00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:09,070
( <i>turns off motor</i> )

00:17:09,137 --> 00:17:10,605
Fresh off an airplane

00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:12,974
from a conference,
and bam--

00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,676
I got seminal fluid.

00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,511
Lucky you.

00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:33,327
Some things never change.

00:17:33,394 --> 00:17:35,196
What's that?

00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,331
Cocaine.

00:17:43,805 --> 00:17:46,207
Presence of blood on the drain.

00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,276
Blood, coke, semen.

00:17:48,343 --> 00:17:52,213
These people were
doing everything
in this kitchen but cook.

00:17:53,314 --> 00:17:54,949
I'll go have
a little chit-chat

00:17:55,016 --> 00:17:55,950
with the hostess.

00:17:56,017 --> 00:17:58,186
They always seem
to know everything.

00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,941
WILLOWS:
Blood clot.

00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:22,010
What is that, sand around it?

00:18:22,076 --> 00:18:24,679
Looks like it.

00:18:24,746 --> 00:18:26,447
What would sand be doing
in a kitchen?

00:18:26,514 --> 00:18:27,375
Well, one thing's

00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,000
for sure:

00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,619
the blood got there
before the sand.

00:18:31,686 --> 00:18:34,655
This was not
a little knife nick.

00:18:34,722 --> 00:18:36,491
This guy was stuck.

00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:38,860
I mean, uh,
he bled out long enough

00:18:38,926 --> 00:18:42,764
for his blood
to pool and clot.

00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,101
Excuse me.

00:18:48,136 --> 00:18:50,071
We're going to need
all your knives.

00:18:51,272 --> 00:18:52,740
Starting with yours.

( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:18:54,142 --> 00:18:55,843
I need them back
by the next shift.

00:18:57,412 --> 00:18:59,647
Well, that depends
on what we find.

00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,188
( <i>siren wailing in distance</i> )

00:19:07,255 --> 00:19:09,991
Oh, uh, this is
the clearest picture

00:19:10,058 --> 00:19:12,193
that we could find
of Brody.

SIDLE:
Thank you.

00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:15,530
I'll get it
to a detective.

00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:17,298
MRS. DAMEN:
The shoeprint that you found

00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:18,533
in Linda's bedroom?

00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,334
Are you thinking
that Brody might have...?

00:19:20,401 --> 00:19:21,602
Oh, we don't know yet.

00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:23,971
We're going to wait and see
what the evidence tells us.

00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,441
I did meet a tenant at your
daughter's apartment complex

00:19:26,507 --> 00:19:29,444
that described Linda as...

00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,079
troubled.

00:19:31,145 --> 00:19:34,349
Did you ever witness
her being violent?

00:19:34,415 --> 00:19:38,419
We like to think of her
as normal, as improving.

00:19:38,486 --> 00:19:41,889
She was prescribed lithium
her junior year of college.

00:19:41,956 --> 00:19:43,925
She was diagnosed bipolar?

00:19:43,991 --> 00:19:45,560
She's a rapid cycler.

00:19:45,626 --> 00:19:47,528
She shifts into manic
in a blink.

00:19:47,595 --> 00:19:52,166
We knew she had been violent
around the complex.

00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,634
Lithium didn't help?

00:19:53,701 --> 00:19:55,703
Well, it's a catch-22.

00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,374
When Linda's in an "up" phase,
she doesn't think she needs

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,242
the lithium,
so she doesn't take it

00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:04,912
which then makes her
more unstable.

00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:09,350
Made.

00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:12,620
I'm sorry for your loss.

00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,356
That's a <i>gueridon</i>

00:20:48,423 --> 00:20:49,824
used for
tableside cooking.

00:20:49,891 --> 00:20:52,827
I thought there was a policy
against the use of these

00:20:52,894 --> 00:20:54,262
in Las Vegas restaurants.

00:20:54,328 --> 00:20:56,542
Ever since a television star
from the '70s

00:20:56,542 --> 00:20:59,000
burned his face by one.

00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:00,301
It's changed dining
forever.

00:21:00,368 --> 00:21:01,402
You know, those V-marks

00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,071
that we found in
the restaurant--

00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,839
those were made
fairly recently.

00:21:04,906 --> 00:21:07,942
Certainly since the '70s.

00:21:09,877 --> 00:21:12,814
I lied about the candles.

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,349
It was an accident.

00:21:14,415 --> 00:21:20,488
According to your owner's log,
it was a bad accident.

00:21:20,555 --> 00:21:22,657
Danny Pasqualle

00:21:22,724 --> 00:21:23,658
Italian male model

00:21:23,725 --> 00:21:25,026
suffered
third-degree burns

00:21:25,093 --> 00:21:26,828
on his face

00:21:26,894 --> 00:21:29,197
the night of
September 26, 2002.

00:21:29,263 --> 00:21:32,633
We do special requests
for special customers.

00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,970
Chef Petrov made
Mr. Pasqualle

00:21:36,037 --> 00:21:38,106
a Cafe Diablo.

00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:45,847
Myers Rum, Grand Marnier,
Kahlua, and now for the ride.

00:21:45,913 --> 00:21:48,549
Did he ever file formal charges
against you?

00:21:48,616 --> 00:21:49,851
No, that's the strange thing.

00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:51,185
He... he never did.

00:21:52,954 --> 00:21:55,623
What am I going to do,
sue for a restaurant?

00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,692
I used to make
five million a year.

00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:58,693
You do the math.

00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,029
BRASS:
So after losing
all that salary

00:22:01,095 --> 00:22:02,397
you never filed suit.

00:22:02,463 --> 00:22:05,299
Maybe you didn't file
charges to keep it quiet

00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:07,201
and settle it for yourself.

00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:10,838
Are you accusing me
of something?

00:22:10,905 --> 00:22:14,275
No charges will be
filed, Mr. Pasqualle

00:22:14,342 --> 00:22:16,277
if... you'd be willing

00:22:16,344 --> 00:22:19,814
to fill out a statement
to that effect.

00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,319
The mark on your hand,
Mr. Pasqualle?

00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,088
Patterned abrasions

00:22:27,155 --> 00:22:28,923
over the dorsal of the hand

00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,059
at the metacarpal
phalangeal joints.

00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:33,127
We call it a "fight bite."

00:22:33,194 --> 00:22:35,029
Human mouths
are full of bacteria.

00:22:35,096 --> 00:22:36,731
A wound from
a human bite

00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:40,034
is a tremendous source
of infection, unfortunately.

00:22:40,101 --> 00:22:41,269
So, what happened,
Mr. Pasqualle?

00:22:41,335 --> 00:22:43,037
You paid the chef
a little visit

00:22:43,104 --> 00:22:45,473
and did your version
of "Etu, Brute?"

00:22:51,512 --> 00:22:55,917
You don't have to say anything,
Mr. Pasqualle.

00:23:00,788 --> 00:23:04,192
We just need your hand.

00:23:20,141 --> 00:23:22,443
( <i>printer whirring</i> )

00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:30,146
Blade #25: not human.

00:23:30,213 --> 00:23:34,851
25 knives in,
and I'm bust.

00:23:37,153 --> 00:23:39,722
Oh, now we're cooking.

00:23:44,327 --> 00:23:46,195
It's not blood.

00:23:46,262 --> 00:23:49,298
There he is-- dollar
slots, wearing the cap.

00:23:49,365 --> 00:23:50,867
How did you track him down?

00:23:50,933 --> 00:23:52,568
We showed his
photo around.

00:23:52,635 --> 00:23:54,103
The ATM in
the lobby--

00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,372
he used it
24 hours ago.

00:23:59,242 --> 00:24:00,476
What is he doing?

00:24:00,543 --> 00:24:03,279
We used to call a guy like that
a bean counter.

00:24:03,346 --> 00:24:05,281
Degenerates paying
25 cents a pop

00:24:05,348 --> 00:24:06,949
in hopes of cracking
a pattern.

00:24:07,016 --> 00:24:08,551
What are the notebooks for?

00:24:08,618 --> 00:24:09,752
It's his results.

00:24:09,819 --> 00:24:11,087
But that joker doesn't realize

00:24:11,154 --> 00:24:13,623
that the patterns can end up
in the hundreds of millions.

00:24:15,091 --> 00:24:17,160
You know, the more I see
of this kind of stuff

00:24:17,226 --> 00:24:18,695
the less I picture
you a gambler.

00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:19,862
This isn't gambling.

00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:21,597
This is the end of the line.

00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:28,838
How long have
you been here, sir?

00:24:30,106 --> 00:24:31,458
Las Vegas Police.

00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:32,041
We want a word
with you.

00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,142
What do you know

00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:34,576
about the death
of Linda Damen?

00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:35,811
Unfortunate.

00:24:35,878 --> 00:24:38,213
I need to...
write my results.

00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,448
I need to...

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,550
document them.

00:24:42,417 --> 00:24:44,586
How did you get the blood
on your shirt?

00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:46,121
What blood?

00:24:46,187 --> 00:24:47,622
We're going to need your shirt.

00:24:47,689 --> 00:24:50,191
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:24:53,394 --> 00:24:54,696
Take it.

00:24:56,164 --> 00:24:57,966
You're coming with the shirt.

00:24:58,032 --> 00:25:00,201
We'll need your shoes, too.

00:25:00,268 --> 00:25:02,504
SANDERS:
Did you know
that some doctors believe

00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,672
that oral bacteria
have no other benefits

00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:07,809
than to make it impossible
for other more vicious bacteria

00:25:07,876 --> 00:25:09,911
to take up residence
in our mouths?

00:25:09,978 --> 00:25:11,346
I knew that, Greg.

00:25:11,413 --> 00:25:13,515
So, then I should just stop
trying to impress you.

00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:15,016
That would
impress me.

00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:17,252
Okay. Well, results
from the Fight Bite Boy.

00:25:17,318 --> 00:25:19,020
I had to get it
from an outside lab

00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:20,288
since we're not equipped

00:25:20,355 --> 00:25:22,223
to do bacterial DNA testing
ourselves.

00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,525
Hint, hint.

00:25:23,591 --> 00:25:24,893
Bacteria on his knuckles

00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:27,996
matches the natural bacteria
in the chef's mouth.

00:25:28,062 --> 00:25:30,799
I guess he settled
out of court.

00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:32,167
I'll never
work again!

00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:33,535
( <i>grunts</i> )

00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:36,771
Looks like he took a cheek swab
of the chef with his own fist.

00:25:37,906 --> 00:25:39,174
Thanks, Greg.

00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,508
Mm-hmm.

00:25:40,575 --> 00:25:41,676
You can see

00:25:41,743 --> 00:25:43,845
why I might have a hard time
believing you, right?

00:25:43,912 --> 00:25:46,448
( <i>raps on glass</i> )

00:25:46,514 --> 00:25:48,616
Excuse me.

00:25:54,155 --> 00:25:57,358
So... our male model
copping to battery?

00:25:57,425 --> 00:25:59,027
He's denying murder.

00:25:59,094 --> 00:26:01,896
Well, maybe
he's telling the truth.

00:26:01,963 --> 00:26:03,732
The earplug
from the meat plant--

00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:05,734
we got a hit on Codus.

00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,535
Kicked out Harold Haskins

00:26:07,602 --> 00:26:09,704
delivery man from Meteor Meat.

00:26:09,771 --> 00:26:11,773
Out on parole for extortion.

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,242
He delivers
to DeBreff Restaurant.

00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:16,444
So, you snuck in the place
to grind up a body?

00:26:16,511 --> 00:26:18,079
No. I didn't even
know what it was

00:26:18,146 --> 00:26:19,114
till it was too late.

00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:23,017
Who exactly gave you
the, uh, meat to grind?

00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:25,520
Uh, it was in the
restaurant freezer

00:26:25,587 --> 00:26:26,955
at the DeBreff.

00:26:27,021 --> 00:26:28,156
You see my face?

00:26:28,223 --> 00:26:30,091
This is me almost believing you.

00:26:30,158 --> 00:26:31,659
Now, I've already
violated your parole

00:26:31,726 --> 00:26:32,927
so whatever
I say to the judge

00:26:32,994 --> 00:26:33,962
is up to you.

00:26:34,028 --> 00:26:34,963
So, what is it?

00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:36,164
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:37,499
It was Ross.

00:26:37,565 --> 00:26:39,167
The sous chef.

00:26:40,502 --> 00:26:42,537
I owed him 3,000 for coke.

00:26:42,604 --> 00:26:46,040
He said I could pay him back
with the favor.

00:26:46,107 --> 00:26:49,077
You ground up a body
as a favor?

00:26:49,144 --> 00:26:50,245
It was already dead.

00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:51,813
It's not like I killed him.

00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,182
Well, that's a very tenuous
distinction.

00:26:54,249 --> 00:26:56,718
Stay right there.

00:26:56,785 --> 00:26:59,053
That's a filet,
not a porterhouse.

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,255
I'm a sous chef.

00:27:00,321 --> 00:27:03,224
20 guys are into me
for recreational substances.

00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:05,427
It doesn't mean
they'd cut a body up for me.

00:27:05,493 --> 00:27:07,095
Ground it up.

00:27:07,162 --> 00:27:09,397
We're thinking that you did
the actual filleting.

00:27:09,464 --> 00:27:10,799
Never happened.

00:27:10,865 --> 00:27:12,067
Ask any of the guys.

00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:13,568
We have.

00:27:13,635 --> 00:27:14,969
They won't talk.

00:27:15,036 --> 00:27:17,605
Military calls it
"Code Red."

00:27:17,672 --> 00:27:20,008
Fierce loyalty to the top dog.

00:27:20,075 --> 00:27:22,544
I guess Petrov was that
until somebody killed him.

00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:25,213
His tragedy is your promotion?

00:27:26,548 --> 00:27:27,782
Excuse me.

00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:29,284
We're in the middle
of a rush here.

00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,453
Customers don't forgive
a cold meal or a late meal.

00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:33,354
I bet
they'd forgive a murder, Les.

00:27:33,421 --> 00:27:34,923
Hey, do you guys
serve mutton?

00:27:34,989 --> 00:27:36,091
What?

00:27:36,157 --> 00:27:37,258
Mutton.

00:27:37,325 --> 00:27:39,360
It's from the French word
for sheep.

00:27:39,427 --> 00:27:41,429
These fibers
look like wool

00:27:41,496 --> 00:27:44,132
and since sheep are sheered
before they're butchered

00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:46,000
I think that somebody
was cooking

00:27:46,067 --> 00:27:48,903
something here,
and it wasn't food.

00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:52,373
Code Red?

00:27:58,413 --> 00:28:00,548
Brody, we have

00:28:00,615 --> 00:28:03,384
your shoeprint
in Linda's blood.

00:28:03,451 --> 00:28:05,453
We also have a sample
of Linda's blood

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,155
that we found on your T-shirt.

00:28:07,222 --> 00:28:09,390
Is there anything
you'd like to tell us?

00:28:09,457 --> 00:28:10,625
Yes.

00:28:10,692 --> 00:28:13,528
Someone is playing that machine
right now and is throwing

00:28:13,595 --> 00:28:15,263
the entire
last 72 hours

00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,565
of calculations
out the window.

00:28:17,632 --> 00:28:18,733
Did you kill this girl

00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,769
and try to make it
look like a suicide?

00:28:20,835 --> 00:28:23,705
If anything,
I tried to save her.

00:28:23,772 --> 00:28:25,607
Save her how?

00:28:25,673 --> 00:28:27,275
I went to her place.

00:28:27,342 --> 00:28:29,377
<i>Borrowed some money</i>
<i>from her.</i>

00:28:31,813 --> 00:28:33,148
I looked in her bedroom.

00:28:33,214 --> 00:28:35,150
I thought
she fell asleep reading.

00:28:35,216 --> 00:28:36,951
Then I saw blood.

00:28:38,953 --> 00:28:40,088
Linda!

00:28:40,155 --> 00:28:42,290
Tried to revive her.

00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:45,693
Oh, oh.

00:28:46,528 --> 00:28:48,596
But you left her there, dead.

00:28:49,898 --> 00:28:50,999
You don't get it.

00:28:51,066 --> 00:28:53,068
Even as the son of God

00:28:53,134 --> 00:28:54,836
I can only do

00:28:54,903 --> 00:28:55,904
so much.

00:29:03,411 --> 00:29:05,480
Oh, I get it.

00:29:05,547 --> 00:29:10,518
You and Linda are kind of
on the same page, huh?

00:29:11,853 --> 00:29:14,389
Did you stop
taking your lithium together?

00:29:14,456 --> 00:29:15,757
Is that it?

00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:18,726
It's not a crime.

00:29:18,793 --> 00:29:20,328
Yeah, you're right.

00:29:20,395 --> 00:29:21,796
It's not.

00:29:29,537 --> 00:29:31,473
Bipolar girl

00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:33,141
meets a bipolar guy.

00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:34,909
Together, they cut out
their medication.

00:29:34,976 --> 00:29:36,277
She ends up
committing suicide.

00:29:36,344 --> 00:29:37,812
It's almost like bipolar boy

00:29:37,879 --> 00:29:39,781
is too high to even
realize what went down.

00:29:39,848 --> 00:29:40,949
Yeah.

00:29:41,015 --> 00:29:42,117
Hey, Doc.

00:29:42,183 --> 00:29:44,452
I was over here
on an exhumation matter.

00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:45,854
I knew you wanted this.

00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,555
Tox results for Linda Damen.

00:29:47,622 --> 00:29:49,524
Thank you.

00:29:50,992 --> 00:29:53,795
No lithium,
just like her parents said.

00:29:53,862 --> 00:29:55,730
She did have a huge dose

00:29:55,797 --> 00:29:57,932
of Valium,
ingested less than an hour

00:29:57,999 --> 00:29:59,467
before her time of death.

00:29:59,534 --> 00:30:00,468
Valium?

00:30:00,535 --> 00:30:01,770
That doesn't make any sense.

00:30:01,836 --> 00:30:04,339
I mean, that's the last thing
a depressed person would take.

00:30:04,406 --> 00:30:06,408
200 milligrams.

00:30:06,474 --> 00:30:09,177
That's more than five times
the normal dosage.

00:30:09,244 --> 00:30:10,545
( <i>whistles</i> )

00:30:10,612 --> 00:30:12,547
That much Valium.

00:30:12,614 --> 00:30:16,418
There's no way she could have
fought somebody off

00:30:16,484 --> 00:30:18,987
if they were coming after her
with a straight razor.

00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:26,208
Greg, how's the
knife coming

00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:28,083
with that mysterious
smudge on it?

00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:30,019
I just got the results.

00:30:30,085 --> 00:30:32,721
Alcohol, acetate
and red dye #58.

00:30:32,788 --> 00:30:34,290
Nail polish.
Mm-hmm.

00:30:36,992 --> 00:30:38,994
May I see your
nails, please?

00:30:47,169 --> 00:30:49,071
Oh.

00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:51,140
Well, I'm going to need
a sample of that polish.

00:30:51,207 --> 00:30:52,441
A scraping.

00:30:52,508 --> 00:30:54,543
Uh, is this small enough?

00:30:56,412 --> 00:30:57,913
Yeah. That'll do.

00:30:59,415 --> 00:31:01,517
Okay, the, uh, three
of you can go.

00:31:01,584 --> 00:31:02,785
Thank you, ladies.

00:31:03,752 --> 00:31:05,287
And I've got a
table for you.

00:31:05,354 --> 00:31:06,355
A five top.

00:31:06,422 --> 00:31:08,591
All by yourself.

00:31:08,657 --> 00:31:11,026
By the window.

00:31:11,093 --> 00:31:13,229
Someone will be with you
shortly.

00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:17,833
I looked into that prescription
at the pharmacy you asked about.

00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,001
Linda Damen, the deceased.

00:31:19,068 --> 00:31:20,169
That was quick.

00:31:20,236 --> 00:31:22,004
She doesn't have a prescription
for Valium.

00:31:22,071 --> 00:31:23,639
Her mother does--
Jane Damen.

00:31:23,706 --> 00:31:25,241
25 milligrams as needed.

00:31:25,307 --> 00:31:27,042
I think we better go
pay Mom a visit.

00:31:27,109 --> 00:31:28,244
Yeah. Thanks, Sully.

00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,478
Okay.

00:31:29,545 --> 00:31:31,347
( <i>computer beeping</i> )

00:31:32,481 --> 00:31:34,550
Wools are worsted.
12-ounce weight.

00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:36,619
That's heavy?

00:31:36,685 --> 00:31:38,721
Light... weave.

00:31:38,788 --> 00:31:41,590
Mostly for season spanners.

00:31:41,657 --> 00:31:43,325
We're talking about clothes?

00:31:43,392 --> 00:31:45,961
Worsted is predominately used
in the manufacturing

00:31:46,028 --> 00:31:48,063
of suits
and light overcoats.

00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,266
The finish on this

00:31:50,332 --> 00:31:52,301
is a trademark coating
in high-end suits.

00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,769
Okay, good.

00:31:53,836 --> 00:31:54,804
Thanks.

00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,405
Mm. I'm not done.

00:31:57,573 --> 00:32:00,376
There was also blood present
on the burnt wool.

00:32:00,442 --> 00:32:03,646
Did we get a DNA test?

00:32:03,712 --> 00:32:06,315
It's victim's blood,
from your chef.

00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:09,018
I know
what you're thinking.

00:32:09,084 --> 00:32:10,586
Couldn't possibly be his suit.

00:32:10,653 --> 00:32:12,421
Chefs wear checks
and white shirts.

00:32:12,488 --> 00:32:15,291
But somebody did burn
a bloody suit

00:32:15,357 --> 00:32:17,259
in the restaurant kitchen.

00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:18,661
A high-end suit.

00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:24,300
You have a candidate.

00:32:26,902 --> 00:32:28,170
You're the new guy.

00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,072
Yeah. Uh, David Hodges.

00:32:30,139 --> 00:32:31,941
Transferred from LAPD.

00:32:32,007 --> 00:32:33,776
( <i>blows air</i> )

00:32:33,843 --> 00:32:35,878
They said I had
an attitude problem.

00:32:35,945 --> 00:32:37,980
Said that I thought
I was entitled.

00:32:38,047 --> 00:32:40,149
( <i>scoffs</i> )

00:32:45,354 --> 00:32:50,960
So that sample I collected
matches the polish

00:32:51,026 --> 00:32:52,795
on this knife.

00:32:52,862 --> 00:32:55,664
You handled this knife.

00:32:55,731 --> 00:32:58,167
So?

00:32:58,234 --> 00:32:59,768
Kitchen's first rule:

00:32:59,835 --> 00:33:03,272
don't touch my knife;
don't touch my johnson.

00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:07,309
Did you stab the chef?

00:33:07,376 --> 00:33:09,311
Well, this is
the sous chef's knife.

00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:10,980
I'm aware of that.

00:33:11,046 --> 00:33:13,149
But when a transfer
is made on a blade

00:33:13,215 --> 00:33:14,650
it's usually
from slippage.

00:33:14,717 --> 00:33:17,419
due to a stabbing motion.

00:33:20,823 --> 00:33:22,992
Ar-Are you charging me
with anything?

00:33:23,058 --> 00:33:24,260
No.

00:33:24,326 --> 00:33:26,428
But why don't you have
a seat out in reception.

00:33:26,495 --> 00:33:29,532
Things could change.

00:33:29,598 --> 00:33:30,933
Mrs. Damen, our detective found

00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,602
this prescription
in your name

00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:34,837
for Valium.

00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:37,807
Can you tell us
anything about that?

00:33:41,076 --> 00:33:43,125
I take Valium on occasion.

00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:44,593
Yes.

00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,928
Our lives get pretty frenetic

00:33:45,995 --> 00:33:47,463
just trying to keep up
with Linda.

00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,665
And you last got
a prescription...

00:33:49,732 --> 00:33:50,833
this past Monday.

00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,301
What does that mean?

00:33:52,368 --> 00:33:53,903
The tox report says

00:33:53,969 --> 00:33:55,237
Linda had five times

00:33:55,304 --> 00:33:57,072
the normal dose of Valium
in her system.

00:33:57,139 --> 00:33:59,441
Because there were
no hesitation marks
on her wrists

00:33:59,508 --> 00:34:01,610
it suggests that someone
else inflicted the wound.

00:34:01,677 --> 00:34:03,913
That much Valium would've been
enough to subdue her.

00:34:03,979 --> 00:34:08,017
Hey, I-I think
you're a little
out of line here.

00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:10,352
I did not drug
my daughter.

00:34:10,419 --> 00:34:11,587
May we have your permission

00:34:11,654 --> 00:34:14,056
to look through the current
contents of your prescription?

00:34:15,391 --> 00:34:17,259
Did Linda's boyfriend
put you up to this?

00:34:17,326 --> 00:34:18,928
Because he is not stable.
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:34:18,994 --> 00:34:20,329
No.

00:34:20,396 --> 00:34:21,964
( <i>phone ringing</i> )
Excuse me.

00:34:22,031 --> 00:34:24,133
We're simply trying
to determine...
Hello?

00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,102
The blouse from your
vic's closet is stained.

00:34:27,169 --> 00:34:29,338
The substances are biological.

00:34:29,405 --> 00:34:31,373
High salt content.

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,775
Male or female?

00:34:34,076 --> 00:34:35,878
Thanks, Greg.

00:34:39,481 --> 00:34:43,219
Mr. and Mrs. Damen, there
are five types of tears--

00:34:43,285 --> 00:34:46,422
sorrow, regret, joy, fear

00:34:46,488 --> 00:34:48,891
and allergic reaction.

00:34:48,958 --> 00:34:52,094
The one thing that
they have in common
is DNA.

00:34:52,161 --> 00:34:54,330
We found a blouse
in your daughter's closet

00:34:54,396 --> 00:34:55,631
the night that she died.

00:34:55,698 --> 00:34:57,700
There was
moisture on it.

00:34:57,766 --> 00:35:01,637
The moisture... was tears.

00:35:01,704 --> 00:35:04,773
The DNA... was male.

00:35:08,077 --> 00:35:10,346
Mr. Damen?

00:35:11,647 --> 00:35:14,250
Were you waiting in the closet
for your daughter?

00:35:17,386 --> 00:35:20,322
We can get a warrant
to test your DNA sample

00:35:20,389 --> 00:35:21,657
against our sample.

00:35:21,724 --> 00:35:23,526
John?

00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:28,497
The... ( <i>sighs</i> )

00:35:28,564 --> 00:35:31,467
The-the only way to get
an adult committed

00:35:31,534 --> 00:35:33,068
for psychological help

00:35:33,135 --> 00:35:35,871
is if they hurt themselves.

00:35:35,938 --> 00:35:37,239
Or someone else.

00:35:37,306 --> 00:35:38,841
Everyone Linda attacked

00:35:38,908 --> 00:35:41,977
was too afraid to file
complaints against her.

00:35:42,044 --> 00:35:45,314
She was out of hand.
She was attacking strangers.

00:35:45,381 --> 00:35:47,349
She was vandalizing
property.

00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:50,619
She was refusing
to take her medication

00:35:50,686 --> 00:35:52,421
and we were helpless
to make her.

00:35:52,488 --> 00:35:58,227
<i>It was supposed to be</i>
<i>a suicide attempt...</i>

00:35:58,294 --> 00:35:59,428
( <i>door rattling</i> )

00:35:59,495 --> 00:36:00,729
<i>but then...</i>

00:36:00,796 --> 00:36:03,699
I heard somebody
at the door and I...

00:36:03,766 --> 00:36:06,969
I-I...

00:36:07,036 --> 00:36:10,005
I guess I panicked.

00:36:13,475 --> 00:36:15,511
<i>I hid in the closet.</i>

00:36:15,578 --> 00:36:18,047

00:36:18,113 --> 00:36:27,289
And, um, she, uh...
when he...

00:36:29,325 --> 00:36:30,559
Linda?

00:36:30,626 --> 00:36:32,127
Linda?!

00:36:32,194 --> 00:36:34,830
( <i>voice breaking</i> ):
<i>By then it was too late.</i>

00:36:36,665 --> 00:36:39,602
I just wanted
to get her help.

00:36:39,668 --> 00:36:42,872
I just wa...
She needed my help.

00:36:42,938 --> 00:36:46,075
I just...

00:36:46,141 --> 00:36:47,943
She, she needed help.

00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,578
Honey, you know...

00:36:49,645 --> 00:36:52,648
she-she wouldn't...

00:37:00,256 --> 00:37:03,092
Reminds of what
my grandmother said
a long time ago.

00:37:03,158 --> 00:37:04,627
I would never
believe her.

00:37:04,693 --> 00:37:06,896
What's that?

00:37:06,962 --> 00:37:11,400
Crazy people make even
sane people act crazy.

00:37:11,467 --> 00:37:14,470
( <i>faint rattling</i> )

00:37:21,143 --> 00:37:23,546

What'd you find?

00:37:23,612 --> 00:37:24,680
Come here.

00:37:24,747 --> 00:37:26,682
Do you hear this?

00:37:26,749 --> 00:37:29,718
( <i>rattling</i> )

00:37:29,785 --> 00:37:31,954
How did we miss that in Trace?

00:37:32,021 --> 00:37:33,088
I don't know.

00:37:33,155 --> 00:37:35,991
But I've learned
that the evidence room

00:37:36,058 --> 00:37:38,460
is the quietest place
in the lab.

00:37:38,527 --> 00:37:40,296
( <i>knife handle clicks</i> )

00:37:43,265 --> 00:37:45,668
Sand. Right--

00:37:45,734 --> 00:37:48,370
for balance and precision.

00:37:49,705 --> 00:37:51,473
Did you know that
to a geologist

00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,175
there's no such
thing as sand?

00:37:53,242 --> 00:37:55,044
Each grain is
its own tiny rock.

00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,813
Fine, glassy crystals...

00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,549
dark.

00:38:00,616 --> 00:38:02,651
Obsidian, I bet.

00:38:02,718 --> 00:38:04,820
Volcanic sand.
Long way from home.

00:38:04,887 --> 00:38:06,722
Japanese call it
singing sand.

00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:09,225
If you walk on certain
beaches in Japan

00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:11,293
it'll make
a musical sound.

00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,862
Never been to Japan

00:38:12,928 --> 00:38:15,264
but I've seen this sand
before...

00:38:15,331 --> 00:38:17,566
on the blood clot.

00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:23,506
( <i>Grissom chuckles</i> )

00:38:23,572 --> 00:38:26,942
"Let us carve him
as a dish fit for the gods."

00:38:27,009 --> 00:38:29,245
I'm going to guess
Shakespeare.

00:38:29,311 --> 00:38:31,514
Julius Caesar.

00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,583
That's your knife.

00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:38,254
This is the owner's log.

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,157
"The sous chef gets 89% of
the meat off of trout filet--

00:38:42,224 --> 00:38:44,660
six percent better
than any chef on the line."

00:38:44,727 --> 00:38:47,596
I don't think
you killed the chef.

00:38:49,632 --> 00:38:51,400
You did fillet him, though.

00:38:51,467 --> 00:38:52,902
<i>Your knife handle slid open...</i>

00:38:52,968 --> 00:38:53,903
( <i>blade clangs</i> )

00:38:53,969 --> 00:38:55,571
<i>...sand went down the drain</i>

00:38:55,638 --> 00:38:57,940
<i>landing on the victim's</i>
<i>clotted blood.</i>

00:38:58,007 --> 00:39:00,176
It's hard work,
carving up a man.

00:39:00,242 --> 00:39:03,145
I believe that's how
you broke your knife handle.

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,116
But you didn't do this alone,
did you?

00:39:08,884 --> 00:39:11,453
A murdered chef
in your kitchen.

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,255
Kiss of death for a restaurant.

00:39:14,957 --> 00:39:16,659
We'll never get
our customers back.

00:39:16,725 --> 00:39:18,761
How am I going to get
a body out of here?

00:39:18,827 --> 00:39:21,997
I do for you,
you do for me.

00:39:22,064 --> 00:39:25,334
Code Red, in fact--
protect the kitchen.

00:39:28,504 --> 00:39:31,240
Some people say
the most important part

00:39:31,307 --> 00:39:33,776
of preparing a meal
is the cleanup.

00:39:33,843 --> 00:39:38,480
<i>While the fillet man disposed</i>
<i>of the chef parts</i>

00:39:38,547 --> 00:39:40,249
you got rid

00:39:40,316 --> 00:39:41,617
<i>of your bloody suit.</i>

00:39:41,684 --> 00:39:43,652
( <i>flames crackling</i> )

00:39:49,592 --> 00:39:50,526
How's it going?

00:39:50,593 --> 00:39:52,461
Well, he's not
denying anything.

00:39:52,528 --> 00:39:54,697
He's not admitting
anything, either.

00:39:54,763 --> 00:39:55,764
( <i>sighs</i> ):
Yeah.

00:39:55,831 --> 00:39:57,533
Same as the
other two here.

00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,235
They need
a little nudge.

00:39:59,301 --> 00:40:01,737
Such as?

00:40:01,804 --> 00:40:03,639
While they're
in our custody

00:40:03,706 --> 00:40:05,774
shall we try
a little theater?

00:40:12,948 --> 00:40:15,618
( <i>whispering</i> )

00:40:18,053 --> 00:40:19,622
Let's go for a walk.

00:40:19,688 --> 00:40:23,025
Hey, relax.
You'll be with a friend.

00:40:23,092 --> 00:40:24,927
Cuff him up.

00:41:03,966 --> 00:41:06,001
Why did you kill him?

00:41:09,038 --> 00:41:13,108
I-I went into the walk-in
to, to get some lemons.

00:41:13,175 --> 00:41:15,044
Oh, yeah... ( <i>moans</i> )

00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,715
He played around
all the time--

00:41:19,782 --> 00:41:23,052
waitresses, patrons...
nobodies.

00:41:23,118 --> 00:41:27,156
But... she was different.

00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,960
She was a chef.

00:41:31,026 --> 00:41:33,128
What does that mean?

00:41:33,195 --> 00:41:37,533
Well, I can't make toast,
um... where did I stand?

00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,535
Hey, beautiful,
I haven't seen
you all night.

00:41:39,602 --> 00:41:41,770
Well, I've seen you.

00:41:41,837 --> 00:41:43,506
( <i>knife clangs</i> )

00:41:43,572 --> 00:41:44,607
( <i>grunts</i> )

00:41:44,673 --> 00:41:45,774
( <i>groans</i> )

00:41:54,517 --> 00:41:57,119
Officer, would you take her
to Booking, please?

00:41:57,186 --> 00:41:58,487
( <i>cuffs rattling</i> )

00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:06,403
All in a day's work.

00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,905
Yeah.

00:42:09,792 --> 00:42:11,249
You up for dinner?
