00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:24,947
Then what?

00:05:25,013 --> 00:05:26,882
And then one guy's
on the ground

00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:28,250
and the other guy's taking off.

00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:29,618
And no, I didn't see his face.

00:05:29,685 --> 00:05:31,587
Did you see a license plate?

00:05:31,653 --> 00:05:33,121
No.

00:05:33,188 --> 00:05:34,456
Can you describe the vehicle?

00:05:34,523 --> 00:05:37,092
It was a pickup.

With one of those cover things

00:05:41,196 --> 00:05:42,698
on the back,
you know, a...
Camper top.

00:05:42,764 --> 00:05:44,233
I know what it's called.

00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:45,601
Look, Roger was
a regular, okay?

00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:46,668
Draft beer.

00:05:46,735 --> 00:05:48,070
Tonight, he's
drinking J.D.

straight up, six in an hour.

00:05:49,605 --> 00:05:51,807
If you ask me,
he was looking for trouble.

00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:05,120
I've been searching high and low
for a blunt object.

00:06:05,187 --> 00:06:07,322
Crow bar, two-by-four, brick,
something like that.

00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:09,324
Nothing.

00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:11,593
But I did find this crack pipe.

00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,728
I'll get it back to the lab

00:06:12,794 --> 00:06:15,731
see if I can get some prints
off of it.

00:06:15,797 --> 00:06:18,100
This roof's not that accessible,
you know?

00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:20,402
Besides, coming all the way
up here to get high and low.

00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:22,237
But still, little extreme
for this part of town

00:06:22,304 --> 00:06:23,639
don't you think?

00:06:23,705 --> 00:06:25,107
Swab it, print it, bag it.

00:06:25,174 --> 00:06:27,276
See if you can find out
who smoked it.

00:06:30,078 --> 00:06:32,181
Okay.

00:06:50,065 --> 00:06:51,567
Wow.

00:06:51,633 --> 00:06:53,202
50 caliber.

00:06:53,268 --> 00:06:54,670
Yeah, you need a cannon

00:06:54,736 --> 00:06:57,005
to fire a hunk of lead that big.

00:06:57,072 --> 00:06:58,740
Feel like hunting for a bullet?

00:06:58,807 --> 00:07:01,710
Anything that might have hit it
would have ripped right through.

00:07:01,777 --> 00:07:04,046
Thing's probably still moving.

See what you can make of this.

00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,703
Hmm.

00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:30,138
Use of only black and gray ink

00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:32,207
is known as fine-line.

00:07:32,274 --> 00:07:33,575
Not a "scratcher" job.

00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:35,010
You recognize this?

As in "tat-too."

Premier skin artist in Vegas.

00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,074
Also a Ph.D. in Psychology.

00:07:47,141 --> 00:07:48,175
He's a shrink?

00:07:48,242 --> 00:07:49,810
Mm-hmm.

00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,963
Hmm.

00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,266
Skin and ink, ink and skin--

00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,402
one makes the other one live.

00:08:40,468 --> 00:08:42,437
You see, that's

00:08:42,504 --> 00:08:43,772
strength

00:08:43,838 --> 00:08:45,373
and that's superiority

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,442
and that's ambition
without limit.

00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:50,245
See, it's the chosen one.

00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:52,147
Hmm.

It's my book.

00:09:00,855 --> 00:09:02,624
All my victims.

00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:06,227
His name was Jimmy Maurer.

00:09:10,265 --> 00:09:11,466
STOKES:
Was?

00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:13,768
What do you mean,
that's not his name anymore?

00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:15,236
He died, didn't he?

00:09:15,303 --> 00:09:16,905
Well, his fate was inevitable.

00:09:16,972 --> 00:09:18,606
I simply gave it form.

00:09:18,673 --> 00:09:24,546
Strength, superiority,
and ambition, huh?

00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:27,449
Not exactly the characteristics
of an angel.

00:09:27,515 --> 00:09:29,451
No, it's not an angel.

00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:30,518
It's Greek Mythology.

00:09:30,585 --> 00:09:31,920
Icarus.

00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:34,990
He flew too close to the sun
on wings of feathers and wax.

00:09:35,056 --> 00:09:37,993
And when the wax melted,
he plunged to his death.

00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:39,160
Hubris.

00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:41,730
Is that what brought Jimmy down,
as well?

00:09:41,796 --> 00:09:43,665
Hey, man, you tell us.

00:09:43,732 --> 00:09:45,533
How should I know?

00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:52,041
Hey, Greggy, any
luck on those blood
and hair samples?

00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:52,707
Don't insult me.

00:09:52,774 --> 00:09:54,542
Luck is for those
without skill.

00:09:54,609 --> 00:09:57,045
Hmm, spoken like a man
who's never hit a jackpot.

00:09:57,112 --> 00:09:59,114
Hmm, sad but true.

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,815
Slot plot on the
blood and hair...

00:10:00,882 --> 00:10:01,983
came back negative.

00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,985
Not human.
They're animal.

00:10:04,052 --> 00:10:06,421
Hmm.

00:10:06,488 --> 00:10:08,556
You can take that
with you if you want.

00:10:08,623 --> 00:10:10,558
Thanks, I will.

00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:11,893
And I spoke
with Brass.

00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,895
That squirrelly
tattoo artist
had a record.

00:10:13,962 --> 00:10:15,063
For what?

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,865
Drug conviction:
crack cocaine.

00:10:16,931 --> 00:10:18,266
You got a print
off of that pipe?

00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,734
Lab's working on it.

00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:20,902
Hey, Doc.

00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:22,070
Hi, fellows.

00:10:22,137 --> 00:10:24,506
Cause of death--
any takers?

00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,808
Blunt force trauma.

00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:27,976
You know if he's asking

00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:29,644
we're not going
to figure it out.

00:10:29,711 --> 00:10:30,645
Nicely played.

00:10:30,712 --> 00:10:31,780
It's suffocation.

00:10:31,846 --> 00:10:34,482
After I cleaned him up,
I noticed bluish

00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:36,051
discolorations on his lips

00:10:36,117 --> 00:10:38,153
and on what's left
of his nail beds.

00:10:40,288 --> 00:10:42,023
Cyanosis?

00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,758
Body was starved
for oxygen.

00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:46,227
Strangled, and then thrown
off of the roof?

00:10:46,294 --> 00:10:47,996
Found no ligature
marks on his neck

00:10:48,063 --> 00:10:49,664
no petechial hemorrhaging.

00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:51,866
Hence, no forcible suffocation.

00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:52,934
Okay, not beaten
to death

00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:54,069
not strangled
to death.

00:10:54,135 --> 00:10:55,770
But something
bad went down
on that roof.

00:10:55,837 --> 00:10:57,305
He left half his
head up there, man.

00:10:57,372 --> 00:10:58,873
Uh, more like... uh...

00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,041
25%.

00:11:00,108 --> 00:11:02,310
BROWN:
Suffocation means
he died with his brain

00:11:02,377 --> 00:11:03,812
still in his head.

00:11:03,878 --> 00:11:05,213
Yeah, but there's
no evidence

00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,748
of anyone else
at the scene.

00:11:06,815 --> 00:11:08,817
How do you suffocate
alone on a rooftop?

00:11:08,883 --> 00:11:10,051
You don't.

00:11:10,118 --> 00:11:11,386
All right.

00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:13,622
High impact
from a high altitude.

00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:18,226
ROBBINS:
Well, above 15,000 feet,
hypoxia can occur in minutes.

00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:19,661
He died in the sky.

00:11:19,728 --> 00:11:22,430
Yeah... and the
rest is gravity.

00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,785
You know, your vic
was an interesting guy.

00:11:30,852 --> 00:11:31,786
He had no home address.

00:11:31,853 --> 00:11:33,667
Just post office boxes

00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:35,836
in California, Utah, Vegas.

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,170
Drive a car?

00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:39,406
Nissan XTerra.

00:11:39,473 --> 00:11:41,475
Cali tags and license,
but he was all squared away.

00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,542
None of this
explains

00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:44,711
how he dropped
out of the sky.

00:11:44,778 --> 00:11:47,481
Well, the, uh,
possibilities
are limited.

00:11:47,547 --> 00:11:49,683
Either he was pushed out
of a plane

00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,285
or he stowed away in
the landing gear, or, um...

00:11:52,352 --> 00:11:55,655
skydiving gone bad.

00:11:55,722 --> 00:11:56,690
Oh, none of that works.

00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,091
I talked to Air Traffic Control

00:11:58,158 --> 00:12:00,193
and they had no aircraft
operating in that area

00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,195
at that time.

00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,801
<i>La Lluvia de Peces.</i>

00:12:07,868 --> 00:12:10,303
What?

00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,838
The raining of fish.

00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:14,775
Occasionally, usually
in the early spring

00:12:14,841 --> 00:12:18,445
in Yoro, Honduras,
it rains, um...

00:12:18,512 --> 00:12:20,647
sardines.

00:12:20,714 --> 00:12:22,716
Sardines?
That's funny.

00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:23,717
Really.

00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:24,851
I've seen it.

00:12:24,918 --> 00:12:27,521
I mean, the scientific
explanation is--

00:12:27,587 --> 00:12:29,356
this sounds
like a Grissom thing--

00:12:29,423 --> 00:12:31,591
is that they get sucked
out of the ocean

00:12:31,658 --> 00:12:34,061
by these waterspouts
that are like, you know

00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:35,829
you know, tornadoes,
and, uh, then...

00:12:35,896 --> 00:12:38,965
Look, the point is, Warrick

00:12:39,032 --> 00:12:42,703
they got to come from somewhere.

00:12:49,176 --> 00:12:51,678
What the hell
were you doing in Honduras?

00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:55,582
Bobby.

00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,317
Not a lot of guns
chambered

00:12:57,384 --> 00:12:58,585
for 50 AE.

00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,020
It kind of narrows the field.

00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:01,388
Got AMT

00:13:01,455 --> 00:13:03,924
Auto Mag Five,
LAR Grizzly...

00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,325
Desert Eagle?

00:13:05,392 --> 00:13:06,827
Yeah, how'd you know?

00:13:06,893 --> 00:13:07,928
I had O'Riley
run the vic

00:13:07,994 --> 00:13:09,363
for registered firearms.

00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:11,331
It turns out that
Roger Mitchel purchased

00:13:11,398 --> 00:13:12,833
a Magnum Research Desert Eagle

00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:14,468
Mark-Seven
three weeks ago.

00:13:14,534 --> 00:13:15,669
I know the gun.

00:13:15,736 --> 00:13:18,238
Idiot-big and shiny.

00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:19,439
Right, well, you know

00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:22,109
some men feel the need
to compensate.

00:13:22,175 --> 00:13:25,412
Actually, a gun like that
intimidates, makes a statement.

00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:26,780
Yes, it does.

00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,949
Beer drinker
switches to bourbon.

00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,717
He's got himself
a brand-new gun.

00:13:30,784 --> 00:13:32,252
He's just looking for a fight.

00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:34,087
Statement is, "Bring it on."

00:13:34,154 --> 00:13:38,692
<i>So, full of liquid courage,</i>
<i>he hauls out the big iron.</i>

00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:42,729
But a drunk
is not hard to disarm.

00:13:42,796 --> 00:13:44,965
( <i>grunting</i> )

00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,400
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:49,436
Vic gets shot
with his own weapon.

00:13:49,503 --> 00:13:52,439
And the perp walks away
with the murder weapon.

00:13:52,506 --> 00:13:54,107
STOKES:
According to Trace,
the yellow dust

00:13:54,174 --> 00:13:57,911
on Jimmy Maurer's leg
was Pinion Pine pollen.

00:13:57,978 --> 00:13:59,780
Say that three times fast.

00:13:59,846 --> 00:14:02,749
Pinion's a desert tree
found in higher elevations

00:14:02,816 --> 00:14:05,485
4,500 feet and up.

00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:08,021
BROWN:
4,500 feet...

00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:09,756
Mount Potosi.

00:14:09,823 --> 00:14:11,658
STOKES:
Yeah, it fits
the bill to a tee.

00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,360
Think our vic was there
before he died.

00:14:13,427 --> 00:14:14,594
That's on the ground.

00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:16,763
Let's get on the Net and figure
out how he got into the air.

00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,598
Yeah, look under what?
Hot air balloons?

00:14:18,665 --> 00:14:20,000
There was nothing in the air.

00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,401
I mean, we can...

00:14:21,468 --> 00:14:22,436
( <i>typing</i> )

00:14:22,502 --> 00:14:23,704
Flying?

00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,339
You're a genius.

00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:27,007
Of course.

00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,642
Pinion Pine Pollen,
Pinion Pine Pollen

00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:31,378
Pinion Pine Pollen.

00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:33,947
O'RILEY:
<i>That camper-top pickup</i>
<i>was reported stolen.</i>

00:14:34,014 --> 00:14:37,250
The R.O. is a Ned Bookman.

00:14:37,317 --> 00:14:38,752
Lives in Henderson.

00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:40,253
Well, that's three
miles from here.

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,355
That's walking distance.

00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:42,823
Gets better.

00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:45,826
Ned Bookman and our vic
live on the same street.

00:14:45,892 --> 00:14:48,228
Ooh, neighbors.

00:14:59,806 --> 00:15:01,842
Ignition block's intact.

00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,378
No sign of forced entry.

00:15:06,913 --> 00:15:09,416
Hey, do you smell something?

00:15:09,483 --> 00:15:10,917
Like what?

00:15:10,984 --> 00:15:12,319
Something...

00:15:12,386 --> 00:15:14,187
fruity.

00:15:14,254 --> 00:15:16,656
I thought it was
your perfume.

00:15:16,723 --> 00:15:17,891
No.

00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,593
I never wear perfume at work.

00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:21,395
It dulls the sense of smell.

00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:29,936
A-ha.

00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,479
Mulberries.

00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:47,875
( <i>tones sounding</i> )

00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:53,136
( <i>tone sounding</i> )

00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,665
( <i>weak tone sounding</i> )

00:16:14,918 --> 00:16:17,587
( <i>camera clicking</i> )

00:16:17,654 --> 00:16:19,589
STOKES:
It's amazing
how simple it is.

00:16:19,656 --> 00:16:22,058
Air fills the canopy
and you're off.

00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,160
BROWN:
Yeah, sounds like you
want to go for a spin.

00:16:24,227 --> 00:16:27,564
Well, it looks like
it might be a rush.

00:16:30,633 --> 00:16:33,069
Paragliding's
a two-piece system--

00:16:33,136 --> 00:16:34,537
harness and canopy.

00:16:34,604 --> 00:16:37,240
Now, the canopies are fitted
to you according to body weight

00:16:37,307 --> 00:16:39,509
so if anyone has dropped
a few for vanity

00:16:39,576 --> 00:16:41,778
speak up now, please.

00:16:41,845 --> 00:16:43,947
No?

00:16:44,013 --> 00:16:45,348
All right.

00:16:45,415 --> 00:16:48,084
You're going
to want to look around.

00:16:48,151 --> 00:16:49,652
Take in the sights.

00:16:49,719 --> 00:16:52,021
Do it.

00:16:52,088 --> 00:16:53,256
Enjoy it.

00:16:53,323 --> 00:16:54,591
The best view
in the world.

00:16:54,657 --> 00:16:57,694
But don't forget,
we weren't born with wings.

00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,995
We had to make them.

00:16:59,062 --> 00:17:02,298
So respect
the equipment, okay?

00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:05,235
All right, then.
It's time to fly.

00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:06,636
Any last questions?

00:17:06,703 --> 00:17:08,538
Yeah.

00:17:08,605 --> 00:17:09,739
Yeah, I know Jimmy.

00:17:09,806 --> 00:17:12,442
The guy's got
an attitude. Cocky.

00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:15,011
Might be able to handle
his own in the air

00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:16,980
but I don't care for his style.

00:17:17,046 --> 00:17:18,248
What's his style?

00:17:18,314 --> 00:17:19,983
Well, he likes
to grandstand.

00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:21,718
You know, this sport's
about soaring.

00:17:21,785 --> 00:17:24,754
He's about showing off.

00:17:24,821 --> 00:17:27,457
Looks like it should be
about having fun.

00:17:27,524 --> 00:17:29,692
Yeah, it's
about having fun.

00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,795
But also,
there's etiquette.

00:17:31,861 --> 00:17:33,696
I mean, a guy
breezes in from nowhere

00:17:33,763 --> 00:17:35,098
does things his own way...

00:17:35,165 --> 00:17:36,566
Ah, maybe the...

00:17:36,633 --> 00:17:38,401
walk back'll
humble him a little.

00:17:38,468 --> 00:17:39,435
The walk back?

00:17:39,502 --> 00:17:40,470
When you fly

00:17:40,537 --> 00:17:41,504
you need thermals

00:17:41,571 --> 00:17:43,072
or upshots of air used for lift.

00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:45,942
I mean, on a good day, you
can stay airborne for hours.

00:17:46,009 --> 00:17:47,577
How high do these
thermals get?

00:17:47,644 --> 00:17:50,413
Well, you can take them
as far as they take you.

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,383
One time I was above
18,000 feet, when I came down

00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,019
I was about 35 miles
from where I launched.

00:17:56,085 --> 00:17:57,420
Whoa.

00:17:57,487 --> 00:17:58,822
Yeah, the walk back.

00:17:58,888 --> 00:18:01,124
That's Jimmy's truck,
it's been there

00:18:01,191 --> 00:18:02,392
since yesterday.

00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:05,428
What kind of trouble
is he in, anyway?

00:18:05,495 --> 00:18:07,197
The worst kind.

00:18:07,263 --> 00:18:08,364
Thanks, Rick.

00:18:12,502 --> 00:18:14,504
Ah, crap!

00:18:14,571 --> 00:18:17,107
Like we said,
your truck's not here.

00:18:17,173 --> 00:18:19,342
Why did you report it stolen?

00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:21,411
Look, I got another car.

00:18:21,478 --> 00:18:23,513
I hardly ever use the pickup.

00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,849
I work nights.

00:18:25,915 --> 00:18:28,017
Anybody could've
stolen it.

00:18:28,084 --> 00:18:29,119
You know,
I mean...

00:18:29,185 --> 00:18:30,887
it could happen.

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,495
Hmm.

00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:40,396
Hide-a-key.

00:18:42,398 --> 00:18:43,500
Empty.

00:18:43,566 --> 00:18:45,301
Anybody else

00:18:45,368 --> 00:18:46,469
know about this?

00:18:46,536 --> 00:18:47,804
Apparently.

00:18:47,871 --> 00:18:49,806
Now how well
did you know the victim?

00:18:49,873 --> 00:18:52,342
Roger lived
across the street.

00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:55,779
Didn't make us pals,
just neighbors.

00:18:55,845 --> 00:18:59,482
WILLOWS:
Looks like Roger's
got a mulberry tree.

00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:03,052
So, Ned, we found

00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:05,321
mulberry branches
in your pickup

00:19:05,388 --> 00:19:07,524
and there's
a mulberry tree

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,426
in your dead neighbor's yard.

00:19:10,493 --> 00:19:12,962
I'm starting to like <i>you,</i> Ned

00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:14,864
and not in a good way.

00:19:14,931 --> 00:19:17,300
Uh, F-F-Frank Craft
stole my truck.

00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:19,335
Uh...

00:19:19,402 --> 00:19:21,671
I mean, I mean
he-he borrowed it.

00:19:21,738 --> 00:19:23,239
He-he...

00:19:23,306 --> 00:19:25,108
he borrows my stuff.

00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:28,311
I don't mind.

00:19:28,378 --> 00:19:31,681
Let me guess, um,
Frank Craft lives in

00:19:31,748 --> 00:19:34,150
the blue house on
the other side of the fence.

00:19:34,217 --> 00:19:35,985
He and Roger, uh...

00:19:36,052 --> 00:19:37,687
had problems.

00:19:37,754 --> 00:19:39,422
But you didn't
hear it from me.

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,662
Please don't say anything.

00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,840
Guy's got a surfboard
for California

00:19:56,906 --> 00:19:59,109
and a snowboard
for Utah.

00:20:00,643 --> 00:20:02,979
And a paragliding canopy
for Nevada.

00:20:04,347 --> 00:20:07,217
Ripped to shreds.

00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,488
It's mine now.

00:20:11,554 --> 00:20:12,856
I'll swab it for epithelials.

00:20:12,922 --> 00:20:14,524
If his canopy
was ripped to shreds

00:20:14,591 --> 00:20:16,292
what the hell
was he flying with?

00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:25,268
What's that?

00:20:25,335 --> 00:20:27,237
"Guess you <i>can</i> fly
with anything.

00:20:27,303 --> 00:20:29,105
Find me
when you get back-- T."

00:20:29,172 --> 00:20:30,740
What?

00:20:34,177 --> 00:20:36,412
I'll check it out.

00:20:39,182 --> 00:20:41,818
Jimmy once told me,
"Only a paraglider knows

00:20:41,885 --> 00:20:43,119
why the birds sing."

00:20:43,186 --> 00:20:44,287
( <i>chuckling</i> )

00:20:44,354 --> 00:20:46,389
That sounds
like a line.

00:20:46,456 --> 00:20:48,825
It is.
They all use it.

00:20:48,892 --> 00:20:51,427
Skydivers, hang gliders, pilots.

00:20:51,494 --> 00:20:54,063
On some girls it even works.

00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,233
Did it work on you?

00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,670
My art is an attempt to express
what it feels like to fly

00:21:00,737 --> 00:21:02,772
and Jimmy
was helping me do that.

00:21:04,908 --> 00:21:06,943
Jimmy's leg loops are unbuckled.
How come?

00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,678
He never
buckled them.

00:21:08,745 --> 00:21:10,814
Jimmy enjoyed showing people up.

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,882
It wasn't enough for him
to be a great flyer.

00:21:12,949 --> 00:21:16,319
He needed everyone to see
that he was fearless.

00:21:16,386 --> 00:21:18,988
Well, I bet that
didn't settle real well

00:21:19,055 --> 00:21:20,323
with Rick Weston.

00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:23,393
When did you take this one?

00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,561
Yesterday.

00:21:24,627 --> 00:21:27,197
And is that the canopy
Jimmy normally flew with?

00:21:27,263 --> 00:21:28,198
Mm-mm.

00:21:28,264 --> 00:21:29,299
Where'd he get it?

00:21:29,365 --> 00:21:31,000
I don't know.

00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:33,069
He told me somebody
messed with his rig

00:21:33,136 --> 00:21:35,705
but that wasn't going
to keep him out of the air.

00:21:35,772 --> 00:21:38,208
And who's he butting
heads with here?

00:21:38,274 --> 00:21:39,242
Fred Dacks.

00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:40,510
Who's that?

00:21:40,577 --> 00:21:42,011
He's a good flyer.
He's very competitive.

00:21:42,078 --> 00:21:43,413
And by the looks
of things

00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,482
he was pretty
competitive with Jimmy.

00:21:45,548 --> 00:21:47,150
Always.

00:21:47,217 --> 00:21:49,719
You think that's going
to give you the edge?

00:21:49,786 --> 00:21:51,554
I could fly with anything.

00:21:51,621 --> 00:21:53,123
Then show me some air, punk.

00:21:56,259 --> 00:21:58,895
( <i>clicking</i> )

00:21:58,962 --> 00:22:00,430
Is that Fred there

00:22:00,497 --> 00:22:01,731
in the yellow and white canopy?

00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:03,199
Jimmy followed his line.

00:22:03,266 --> 00:22:04,367
He went after him hard.

00:22:04,434 --> 00:22:06,236
Had to win
at all costs.

00:22:06,302 --> 00:22:08,625
Expensive price to pay.

00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:15,511
This guy Kraft's had a dozen
complaints filed against him

00:22:15,578 --> 00:22:17,179
by residents on the block.

00:22:17,246 --> 00:22:21,542
Property line disputes,
petty thefts, one assault.

00:22:21,834 --> 00:22:23,166
A regular Mister Rogers.

00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,178
Yeah.

00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Check this out.

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,334
Creative parking?

00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:28,602
Something.

00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:46,795
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:22:50,131 --> 00:22:50,792
What do you want?

00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:51,708
Frank Kraft?

00:22:52,634 --> 00:22:53,568
So what?

00:22:53,635 --> 00:22:54,542
Detective O'Riley.

00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:56,004
Vegas P.D.

00:22:56,071 --> 00:22:58,083
This is Catherine Willows
from the Crime Lab.

00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,250
We'd like to have a
few words with you.

00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,676
Show me the badge.

00:23:03,612 --> 00:23:05,083
WILLOWS:
That's a hell of a
bruise you've got

00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,000
on your chin, Mr. Kraft.

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,934
How did you get that?

00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:08,435
I sent away for it.

00:23:08,502 --> 00:23:10,437
You want one of your own?

00:23:10,504 --> 00:23:13,107
( <i>chuckles lightly</i> )

00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:17,011
Recoil's a bitch, isn't it?

00:23:17,077 --> 00:23:18,612
( <i>gunshot, grunting</i> )

00:23:20,648 --> 00:23:22,182
Do you have a dog?

00:23:22,249 --> 00:23:24,084
Do you have a warrant?

00:23:24,151 --> 00:23:25,719
No, we're just talking here.

00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:30,291
Nice fellow.

00:23:30,357 --> 00:23:31,992
BROWN:
According to the manager

00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:34,762
Fred Dacks has been working here
for three years.

00:23:34,828 --> 00:23:36,497
Model employee,
knows his gear.

00:23:36,564 --> 00:23:37,665
Hi.
Hi.

00:23:37,731 --> 00:23:39,133
I'm looking
for Fred Dacks.

00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:40,401
He's right over there.

00:23:40,467 --> 00:23:41,669
Thanks.
You're welcome.

00:23:41,735 --> 00:23:45,005
But guess who just got
hired here a month ago?

00:23:45,072 --> 00:23:46,340
Uh, Jimmy Maurer?

00:23:46,407 --> 00:23:48,676
Yeah. Small world, huh?

00:23:48,742 --> 00:23:50,177
Yeah, I'll say.

00:23:50,244 --> 00:23:51,178
Fred Dacks?

00:23:51,245 --> 00:23:52,846
Yeah, what can
I do for you?

00:23:52,913 --> 00:23:55,216
I'm Warrick Brown,
this is Nick Stokes.

00:23:55,282 --> 00:23:57,051
We're from the Las Vegas
Crime Lab.

00:23:57,117 --> 00:23:59,620
We need to ask you a few
questions about Jimmy Maurer.

00:23:59,687 --> 00:24:00,621
Jimmy.

00:24:00,688 --> 00:24:02,756
The guy was a punk.

00:24:02,823 --> 00:24:04,592
Other than paragliding
and working here

00:24:04,658 --> 00:24:06,527
we had nothing in common.

00:24:06,594 --> 00:24:08,429
Except maybe that tattoo
right there.

00:24:11,265 --> 00:24:13,167
Yeah, only 'cause that fool
bit it off me.

00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:14,335
This was a one-of-a-kind

00:24:14,401 --> 00:24:15,803
around here until he rolled in

00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:17,471
with his little birdman
or whatever.

00:24:17,538 --> 00:24:19,006
You mean Icarus, right?

00:24:19,073 --> 00:24:20,407
Whatever, it doesn't
change a thing.

00:24:20,474 --> 00:24:22,042
The guy was a mouth.

00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:23,644
He threw shade
all over the place.

00:24:23,711 --> 00:24:24,645
Really?

00:24:24,712 --> 00:24:25,646
Yeah.

00:24:25,713 --> 00:24:27,815
Funny, that's what
we heard about you.

00:24:27,882 --> 00:24:29,083
Oh, is that right?

00:24:29,149 --> 00:24:31,000
From who?
That artsy chick?

00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,708
He was sticking it to her.

00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:33,959
What did you think
she was going to say?

00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:35,022
Plus, she was still
pissed at me

00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:36,156
that I didn't take part

00:24:36,223 --> 00:24:37,558
in her little
"masterpiece."

00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,727
That really doesn't
concern me, Mr. Dacks.

00:24:39,793 --> 00:24:41,095
What I want to know is

00:24:41,161 --> 00:24:43,497
did you fly with Jimmy
the day he died?

00:24:43,564 --> 00:24:44,498
Hell no.

00:24:44,565 --> 00:24:46,000
I wouldn't fly with him.

00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:47,301
Dude can't match my skills.

00:24:47,368 --> 00:24:48,802
Nothing but a menace.

00:24:48,869 --> 00:24:50,004
BROWN:
Try again.

00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,538
Yellow canopy.

00:24:54,942 --> 00:24:56,510
We know that's you, Fred.

00:24:56,577 --> 00:24:57,778
Oh, yeah. See?

00:24:57,845 --> 00:24:58,913
Tight line, leading edge

00:24:58,979 --> 00:25:00,848
to the wind.
Carving it up.

00:25:00,915 --> 00:25:02,349
Must be me.

00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,371
Yeah, yeah, I remember
now, all right?

00:25:24,438 --> 00:25:25,873
Last time I saw Jimmy,
he was still

00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,308
on the ground tugging
on his junk.

00:25:27,374 --> 00:25:29,977
It wasn't his junk,
it was someone else's.

00:25:30,044 --> 00:25:32,313
Well, then, why are you
talking to me, man?

00:25:32,379 --> 00:25:34,315
'Cause the only rig
I got is my own.

00:25:34,381 --> 00:25:35,749
We done?

00:25:35,816 --> 00:25:37,218
Yeah, for now.

00:25:37,284 --> 00:25:38,385
Uh-huh.

00:25:42,723 --> 00:25:43,924
Uh, you know what?

00:25:43,991 --> 00:25:45,392
I'll take this one.

00:25:48,062 --> 00:25:49,230
WILLOWS:
Let me guess.

00:25:49,296 --> 00:25:51,632
Citizen Ned doesn't want
to get involved?

00:25:51,699 --> 00:25:53,767
Kraft scares the
crap out of the guy.

00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:57,004
Well, I guess he doesn't want
to be seen talking to us.

00:25:57,071 --> 00:26:00,274
Boiled down,
basically he said
Kraft and the vic

00:26:00,341 --> 00:26:02,009
had a pretty
bad history.

00:26:02,076 --> 00:26:04,445
Yeah, that's becoming
really clear.

00:26:04,511 --> 00:26:05,913
Check this out.

00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,448
Kraft was stealing
cable from Edmonds.

00:26:07,514 --> 00:26:08,682
Edmonds cuts the line.

00:26:08,749 --> 00:26:10,885
Hate thy neighbor.

00:26:10,951 --> 00:26:13,153
Did Ned mention anything
about Kraft's dog?

00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,023
Only that it was always
chained up in the yard.

00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,291
And always barking.

00:26:20,728 --> 00:26:21,629
( <i>barking</i> )

00:26:21,695 --> 00:26:22,630
( <i>tires screeching</i> )

00:26:22,696 --> 00:26:23,631
<i>I'm starting to think</i>

00:26:23,697 --> 00:26:26,333
the victim may have
taken care of that.

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,136
What about
the tire marks?

00:26:29,203 --> 00:26:31,138
Not enough detail--
we'd never get a match.

00:26:31,205 --> 00:26:33,841
We can't check
Kraft's property out

00:26:33,908 --> 00:26:35,309
without a warrant.

00:26:35,376 --> 00:26:37,111
But...

00:26:39,213 --> 00:26:41,682
Oh, that won't get you
a warrant, either.

00:26:42,716 --> 00:26:45,152
You like jigsaw puzzles?

00:26:51,292 --> 00:26:52,393
( <i>grunts</i> )

00:27:14,181 --> 00:27:15,749
Epithelials on
the slashed canopy

00:27:15,816 --> 00:27:18,118
match the ones on the
sleeping bag drawstring.

00:27:18,185 --> 00:27:20,387
Fred Dacks,
both places.

00:27:20,454 --> 00:27:22,289
Thank you and good night.

00:27:22,356 --> 00:27:24,124
( <i>exhales</i> )

00:27:24,191 --> 00:27:25,626
So Fred does a number

00:27:25,693 --> 00:27:27,995
on Jimmy's canopy to
keep him from flying.

00:27:28,062 --> 00:27:29,530
He's threatened
by the guy.

00:27:29,597 --> 00:27:32,099
It's to keep from getting
shown up, you know.

00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:34,168
He needs to be
the top dog, huh?
Hmm.

00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,369
Yeah, that sounds like you.

00:27:35,436 --> 00:27:37,171
Who?
You.

00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,208
SANDERS:
That sounds
like both of you.

00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:39,333
Now please,
can you take this

00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:40,125
somewhere else?

00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:43,000
So... Jimmy gets a new canopy.

00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,250
Flies, dies.

00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,792
Comes down
unattached.

00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:48,583
We got no canopy,
we got no harness.

00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,085
If we want to find out
what happened

00:27:50,152 --> 00:27:51,253
we need to find that rig.

00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:53,388
Well, you're not going
to find it here.

00:27:53,455 --> 00:27:54,589
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

00:27:54,656 --> 00:27:56,525
Have you taken
your medication today?

00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:57,792
See ya.

00:27:59,828 --> 00:28:01,029
125 hertz?

00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,531
Minus 30 decibels.

00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:06,468
It's a significant decline
from your last visit.

00:28:06,535 --> 00:28:09,371
Yes, but most human speech
is above 300 hertz.

00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,139
My midrange is still clear.

00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:13,775
If it were clear all the time,
you wouldn't be here.

00:28:13,842 --> 00:28:15,911
I think it's time
to consider

00:28:15,977 --> 00:28:19,414
something like... surgery.

00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:22,117
Think about it.

00:28:22,184 --> 00:28:23,451
Let me know.

00:28:32,792 --> 00:28:34,917
BROWN:
He took off here

00:28:34,917 --> 00:28:36,375
and he came down here,
right?

00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:37,543
Yeah.

00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:40,580
Now, the canopy's designed
to soar.

00:28:40,646 --> 00:28:42,014
Has to fall downwind
of the body.

00:28:42,081 --> 00:28:45,851
And at 15,000 feet,
wind was northeast

00:28:45,918 --> 00:28:49,222
at 22 miles per hour.

00:28:49,288 --> 00:28:51,324
Well, we get a little
classical dynamics going on

00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,758
we can find this rig.

00:28:58,464 --> 00:29:00,433
A-ha.

00:29:00,499 --> 00:29:03,603
Search area
is northeast Summerlin.

00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:05,571
Yeah, let's put out a broadcast.

00:29:05,638 --> 00:29:10,443
STOKES:
Patrol unit spotted it
on a routine traffic stop.

00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:13,546
BROWN:
Yeah, we lucked out.

00:29:15,915 --> 00:29:17,617
What have we got?

00:29:17,683 --> 00:29:19,151
Well...

00:29:22,455 --> 00:29:24,123
Bingo.

00:29:27,927 --> 00:29:29,829
These leg loops,
they're unbuckled.

00:29:29,896 --> 00:29:31,297
I guess there's no surprise
there.

00:29:32,331 --> 00:29:34,300
15,000 feet up,
no helmet

00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:36,702
the only thing
holding you in

00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:40,473
are two shoulder harnesses
and a chest strap.

00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:42,642
Not the kind of rush
you're looking for?

00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:44,644
Uh-uh.

00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:53,252
( <i>rustling</i> )

00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:55,588
( <i>rustling</i> )

00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,191
Check this out.

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,262
"Property of Potosi
Glide Center."

00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:04,430
That makes two liars.

00:30:04,497 --> 00:30:05,631
Weston didn't tell us

00:30:05,698 --> 00:30:08,000
he gave Jimmy
his replacement rig.

00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:11,070
'Cause he knew how it would
end up.

00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,741
Jimmy never had a chance, man.

00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:18,678
No way. I wanted to see him
get his ass kicked, not killed.

00:30:18,744 --> 00:30:22,181
Yeah, problem is
he did get killed.

00:30:22,248 --> 00:30:24,150
Flying your canopy.

00:30:24,216 --> 00:30:26,152
I don't know how that happened.

00:30:26,218 --> 00:30:28,588
BROWN:
Well, it seems
the lines leading

00:30:28,654 --> 00:30:30,890
to the A-riser were cut.

00:30:40,266 --> 00:30:43,836
Your rig,
your responsibility.

00:30:46,372 --> 00:30:48,407
This is your chance.

00:30:48,474 --> 00:30:49,742
I'd take it.

00:30:52,111 --> 00:30:55,815
Fred said that, uh...

00:30:55,881 --> 00:30:59,385
he just wanted to teach Jimmy
a lesson.

00:30:59,452 --> 00:31:00,486
Rick.

00:31:00,553 --> 00:31:01,988
Yeah?

00:31:02,054 --> 00:31:03,723
Jimmy's going to hit
you up for a canopy.

00:31:03,789 --> 00:31:05,725
Why don't you give him
something big and slow?

00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:07,326
Oh, I got that
blue-green trainer.

00:31:07,393 --> 00:31:08,661
That ought to be fun.

00:31:08,728 --> 00:31:10,997
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Perfect.

00:31:11,063 --> 00:31:12,498
Ten minutes later

00:31:12,565 --> 00:31:15,167
Jimmy shows up all hot.

00:31:15,234 --> 00:31:17,536
He asked, I gave, he took.

00:31:17,603 --> 00:31:19,705
Couldn't let Fred get the better
of him.

00:31:19,772 --> 00:31:23,509
Look, Jimmy lacked discipline.

00:31:23,576 --> 00:31:27,079
He needed to be brought down
a peg or two.

00:31:27,146 --> 00:31:29,315
You brought him
all the way down.

00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:35,443
Don't tell me.

00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:37,244
Rick pleaded ignorance.

00:31:37,311 --> 00:31:38,913
Right before
he lawyered it up.
Really?

00:31:38,979 --> 00:31:41,291
Well, that guy's
wasting his money.

00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:42,683
Take a look.

00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,559
It's frayed.

00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:55,663
You're saying if he had cut it
with a tool, it'd be clean.

00:31:55,729 --> 00:31:57,598
These lines are spun polymer.

00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,867
They're lightweight,
but strong as hell

00:31:59,934 --> 00:32:02,369
covered in a plastic shell;
now, over time

00:32:02,436 --> 00:32:04,071
that plastic coating
wears down.

00:32:04,138 --> 00:32:06,307
Unprotected lines
rub against one another

00:32:06,373 --> 00:32:08,876
<i>weakening, fraying, until...</i>

00:32:08,943 --> 00:32:09,910
...snap!

00:32:09,977 --> 00:32:12,313
It's normal wear
and tear, man.

00:32:12,379 --> 00:32:15,149
But Weston knew that
that canopy was in bad shape.

00:32:15,216 --> 00:32:18,752
And we don't have any evidence
to suggest that he sabotaged it.

00:32:18,819 --> 00:32:21,522
Do you remember a case
about a year ago?

00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:23,090
Diablo Canyon?

00:32:23,157 --> 00:32:26,494
Oh, the victim of sudden weather
that you thought was murdered.

00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,495
Yeah.

00:32:27,561 --> 00:32:29,864
You fool me once, shame on you.

00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:32,433
You fool me twice...
shame on me.

00:32:34,668 --> 00:32:35,836
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:32:35,903 --> 00:32:37,271
Can you help me out?

00:32:37,338 --> 00:32:38,305
Uh... depends.

00:32:38,372 --> 00:32:40,107
I can't get out
into the field

00:32:40,174 --> 00:32:43,244
because I'm maxed out
on overtime for the month.

00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:46,347
Ah, and you're confined
to the lab, huh?

00:32:46,413 --> 00:32:49,283
Well, hey, look,
it's regular hours.

00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:52,052
I mean, go have dinner
with the boyfriend...

00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:53,053
Hank, right?

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,589
And, and...
go, go to a spa.

00:32:55,656 --> 00:32:57,992
Hank is not my boyfriend.

00:32:58,058 --> 00:33:00,594
And you know, those places
are filled with bacteria.

00:33:03,764 --> 00:33:04,865
Sara, I don't make
the rules around here.

00:33:04,932 --> 00:33:06,867
You've got to talk to
Grissom about that.

00:33:06,934 --> 00:33:10,805
Yeah...he's, um, not really
in a talking mood.

00:33:10,871 --> 00:33:13,474
What makes you think
he's going to talk to me?

00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:16,877
Get some rest.

00:33:16,944 --> 00:33:18,879
I'm not tired.

00:33:18,946 --> 00:33:19,880
Really.

00:33:19,947 --> 00:33:21,982
I'm not tired.

( <i>leaves rustling</i> )

00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:46,750
That's the cumulus
cloud formed by
warm air rising?

00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,685
The thermals?

00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:49,420
Yeah, the bigger the cloud

00:34:49,486 --> 00:34:51,555
the more air
that gets sucked in

00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:54,024
the stronger
the thermal.

00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:55,726
And check out our boys.

00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,628
Heading straight
for it.

00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:00,531
Yep. He's probably getting
the ride of his <i>life.</i>

00:35:10,941 --> 00:35:13,510
( <i>wind gusting</i> )

00:35:19,216 --> 00:35:20,851
WARRICK:
<i>He's rising fast.</i>

00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:22,553
Air is getting thinner.

00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,155
15,000 feet

00:35:25,222 --> 00:35:27,358
he passes out and suffocates.

00:35:27,424 --> 00:35:30,060
( <i>wind gusting</i> )

00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:34,031
( <i>gasping</i> )

00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:35,499
You catch a good thermal

00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:37,835
and you take it
as far as it takes you--

00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,370
dead or alive.

00:35:39,436 --> 00:35:41,305
( <i>wind gusting</i> )

00:35:49,179 --> 00:35:52,549
And to show Fred up,
Jimmy had to fly higher.

00:35:52,616 --> 00:35:55,552
But he had an oxygen tank...
on his harness.

00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:57,021
Why didn't he use it?

00:35:57,087 --> 00:35:59,723
Good question.

00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:16,974
The key word here:
retaliation.

00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,743
Roger Edmonds cuts the cable

00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:20,744
that you stole.

00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,613
He was stealing it himself.

00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,848
Of course, he was.

00:36:24,915 --> 00:36:29,687
( <i>sighs</i> ):
So, then you...
chop up his tree...

00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,394
borrow Ned's truck
to dump the branches...

00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:39,597
I borrow Ned's stuff
all the time; he doesn't mind.

00:36:39,663 --> 00:36:41,599
It's not important to him;
it's no big deal...

00:36:41,665 --> 00:36:42,967
Shut up.

00:36:43,033 --> 00:36:44,468
This isn't about Ned.

00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,337
It's about Roger.

00:36:46,403 --> 00:36:48,172
So...

00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,175
while you're out dumping
the branches

00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,509
Roger comes home

00:36:52,576 --> 00:36:54,979
and sees what
you've done to his tree.

00:36:55,045 --> 00:36:58,115
He ups the ante.

00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,042
Desert Eagle.

00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,813
Something else you...
borrowed?

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,350
He killed my dog.

00:38:14,658 --> 00:38:16,560
Well, the gauge reads full.

00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,996
Yeah, I don't think
it works, bro.

00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,432
There's only one way
to find out.

00:38:24,034 --> 00:38:25,502
Flowing fine.

00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:26,904
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,039
An experienced flyer,

00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,008
prepared for
the altitude.

00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:34,445
There's no reason not
to use his oxygen.

00:38:34,511 --> 00:38:35,946
( <i>scoffs</i> )

00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:38,382
Unless he didn't think
he needed it.

00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,487
( <i>machinery whirring</i> )

00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,992
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:38:51,061 --> 00:38:53,697
Okay.

00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:56,567
STOKES:
Las Vegas is 2,030 feet
above sea level.

00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,369
You got that thing
plugged in yet?

00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,106
There it is.

00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:03,908
Let's see what we've got.

00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:05,409
( <i>computer beeps</i> )

00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,111
30 feet.

00:39:07,177 --> 00:39:08,112
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:39:08,178 --> 00:39:11,215
I, uh, I think we're off
by a couple of G's.

00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:15,085
I'll dust it.

00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:18,122
Jimmy's altimeter,
your fingerprints...

00:39:18,188 --> 00:39:19,723
on the inside.

00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,758
That's cute.

00:39:20,824 --> 00:39:23,093
You should put it in a frame.

00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,230
So I fix gear for other flyers
sometimes, big deal.

00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:27,898
WARRICK:
Oh, you fixed it,
all right.

00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:29,500
You decalibrated it.

00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,602
It was off by 2,000 feet.

00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,047
In the air,
you lose perspective.

00:39:43,113 --> 00:39:45,282
You have to trust
your instruments.

00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:47,918
Jimmy didn't know
how high he actually was.

00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:51,689
( <i>canopy rustling</i> )

00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,807
( <i>wind gusting</i> )

00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:13,944
Hey, I already told you, man,
this dude was soft in the air.

00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:15,512
He could've turned back anytime.

00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,314
BRASS:
But you knew he wouldn't.

00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:18,949
You set him up.

00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,252
WARRICK:
Yeah, you had perfect sky

00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:24,588
massive canopy,
bitchen thermals, dude

00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:27,324
and a challenge
he'd never refuse.

00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:29,326
You played him against himself.

00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:30,628
( <i>wind gusting</i> )

00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,563
( <i>canopy rustling</i> )

00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:42,339
You couldn't stand the fact
that he was better than you.

00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,541
Hey, I called him out,
he took me on.

00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,377
Bigger air, higher altitudes

00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:49,146
push the limit, dude--
that's why we fly.

00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:50,981
No, it's not why <i>you</i> fly.

00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:53,350
The truth is on your arm.

00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:54,818
Alecto...

00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:58,155
Magaera, Tisiphone;
The Three Furies.

00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:01,625
Unceasing anger

00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:04,128
vengeance and jealousy.

00:41:04,194 --> 00:41:07,831
That's what
you're about.

00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:09,934
Sorry, dude.

00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:15,839
Hey, Catherine.

00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:18,576
Hey... I heard you know
your Greek Mythology.

00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,945
I'm impressed--
never would've guessed.

00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:23,080
Yeah, I'm a mystery.

00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,081
Yes, you are.

00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,482
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:27,418
So, where's Nick?

00:41:27,484 --> 00:41:29,119
He bugged out early.

00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:31,488
Well, good work, you guys--
both of you.

00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,525
Would you let him know?

00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:36,560
Thanks. Yeah, I will.

00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:37,928
I'll see you around.

00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,763
All right. Have a good morning.

00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,600
You, too.

00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,204
( <i>knocks</i> )

00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:49,840
Closed that murder
I was working.

00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:53,410
A man's life for a dog's life
for a mulberry tree.

00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:55,546
( <i>sighs</i> ):
Sometimes I wonder
if people are meant

00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:56,547
to live together.

00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:57,681
Well, you know
what they say--

00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:59,250
"Good fences make
good neighbors."

00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:02,586
Then you'd make
a <i>great</i> neighbor.

00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:03,587
Hmm.

00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:04,588
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:07,658
New case?

00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,627
Ongoing.

00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,265
Oh...

00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,432
...bugs.

00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:16,934
Mm.

00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,792
Enjoy.
