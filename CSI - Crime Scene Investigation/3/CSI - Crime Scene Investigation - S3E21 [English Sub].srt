00:03:04,195 --> 00:03:07,959
She was sweet, polite, quiet.

Horses were her life.

00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,035
She was great with them.

She was worried
about the horse,

00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,044
but that
was nothing new.

You'd never use a tranq gun

the body's absorption
of fentanyl

00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,309

from going into reflux.

I'd say twice before.

00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:18,271
Third time's
the charm.

00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:00,583
STOKES:
Hey, fashionista.

00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,500
Brass collected all the shoes.
You were right.

00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,336
Not only did we find a match,
but I also found trace elements.

00:14:05,403 --> 00:14:06,938
Equus caballus?

00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:08,006
Horse dung all the way.

00:14:08,072 --> 00:14:09,908
Brass is bringing
her in now.

00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:10,909
Thanks.

00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,177
Our horse trainer has

00:14:13,244 --> 00:14:14,846
paramortem bruising
and scraping,

00:14:14,913 --> 00:14:17,615
ranging from minor
to major,

00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:18,783
all consistent

00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:19,918
with being trampled.

00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,953
What's not consistent
is this:

00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,455
Pinpoints.

00:14:24,522 --> 00:14:26,758
An opiate overdose?

00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:27,892
Torphine.

00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,094
A thousand times
as potent as morphine.

00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,296
Tranquilizer.

00:14:31,362 --> 00:14:32,297
Mm-hmm.

00:14:32,363 --> 00:14:33,464
One of the bruises

00:14:33,531 --> 00:14:34,866
contains
a puncture wound

00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:37,101
about the same size
as that dart you found.

00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,072
How do you shoot yourself
in the shoulder

00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:42,640
with a tranquilizer rifle?

00:14:42,707 --> 00:14:43,975
Someone else shot her.

00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:46,978
And framed the horse.

00:14:47,045 --> 00:14:48,580
Miss Fitzgerald,
your shoe print

00:14:48,646 --> 00:14:49,981
was found
in the cargo hold

00:14:50,048 --> 00:14:51,983
where Lori Hutchins'
body was found.

00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,786
Please... call me Harper.

00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,421
Were you down there, Harper?

00:14:56,487 --> 00:14:57,455
Yes.

00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:00,725
It is my plane.
I can go wherever I please.

00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:02,060
Lady...

00:15:02,126 --> 00:15:04,195
why were you
down there?

00:15:04,262 --> 00:15:05,630
To woo her.

00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,599
I know how much Merrit

00:15:07,665 --> 00:15:08,900
is paying you.

00:15:08,967 --> 00:15:11,102
Why don't you write
your own check?

00:15:11,169 --> 00:15:12,804
Thank you,
all the same,

00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,405
but I'm not making
any changes right now.

00:15:14,472 --> 00:15:16,474
You don't strike me
as the kind of woman

00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,009
who'd take no for an answer.

00:15:18,076 --> 00:15:19,811
Mmm... I'm not.

00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,980
I figured she'd come around.

00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,114
Besides...

00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:26,150
she's no use to me dead.

00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,852
STOKES:
We need a DNA sample.

00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,955
Open up.

00:15:33,992 --> 00:15:35,927
( <i>sensual warble</i> )

00:15:35,994 --> 00:15:37,829
( <i>wry laugh</i> )

00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,898
( <i>wind whistling</i> )

00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,308
Getting a strange
sense of deja vu.

00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,543
It's raining bodies here.

00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,049
National Park Service
found her.

00:15:58,116 --> 00:16:00,118
She was beyond
our perimeter.

00:16:00,184 --> 00:16:02,220
We had no reason to
believe that there
were more bodies.

00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:03,888
They're looking for any others.

00:16:03,955 --> 00:16:05,757
Want to turn her over?

00:16:10,128 --> 00:16:13,631
He's wearing a suit.
She's wearing a prom dress?

00:16:13,698 --> 00:16:16,267
That's weird.

00:16:27,478 --> 00:16:29,013
No prior scarring
on the wrists,

00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,782
but the same
transdermal patch.

00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,786
That white substance
looks like the same stuff

00:16:34,852 --> 00:16:36,154
you found
near Toby's body.

00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,223
Seems like Romeo
had a Juliet.

00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:41,326
Who got out of bed and ended up
a half-a-mile away.

00:16:41,392 --> 00:16:43,094
Her dress

00:16:43,161 --> 00:16:45,129
is way too big.

00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:49,400
What are you thinking?

00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:53,371
Vanity,
thy name is teenage girl.

00:16:53,438 --> 00:16:56,140
They were
trying to go out in style.

00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,644
Something's off.

00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:03,915
The tranquilizer gun
looks like a wipe-down,

00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,050
and there's no prints
on the ceiling dart.

00:17:06,117 --> 00:17:09,020
How about the dart
in the container?

00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:11,189
Partial palm print.
Not enough for comparison.

00:17:11,256 --> 00:17:13,791
But, there was three different
matches on the handrail

00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:16,594
leading down
to the cargo bay.

00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,563
A Harper Fitzgerald...

00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,299
Owner of the plane.

00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:22,767
Jason Banks...

00:17:24,202 --> 00:17:26,070
Steward who brought
the vic her dinner.

00:17:26,137 --> 00:17:27,505
Rhone Confer.

00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,241
Formerly a concierge

00:17:30,308 --> 00:17:31,309
at the Orpheus.

00:17:31,376 --> 00:17:33,745
Concierge...

00:17:33,811 --> 00:17:35,346
interesting.

00:17:36,948 --> 00:17:38,549
It is?

00:17:38,616 --> 00:17:40,051
Those brown shavings

00:17:40,118 --> 00:17:42,754
that we collected
from the cargo hold

00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,390
and the horse's teeth
were tobacco.

00:17:45,456 --> 00:17:47,125
More specifically,

00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,561
of Volando and
Colorado Maduro.

00:17:49,627 --> 00:17:51,095
Cigar tobacco.

00:17:51,162 --> 00:17:52,964
Sometimes a cigar
is just a cigar,

00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,466
but when it does not contain
Propylene Glycol,

00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,402
an additive used in
the humidification process...

00:17:57,468 --> 00:17:59,504
Then it's a Cuban cigar.

00:17:59,571 --> 00:18:00,638
Dominicans
are just as good,

00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,340
but, uh... they're legal,

00:18:02,407 --> 00:18:05,009
so, you know,
where's the fun in that?

00:18:06,778 --> 00:18:09,347
So if I'm looking for an
illegally imported Cuban cigar,

00:18:09,414 --> 00:18:11,349
I go to...

00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,184
Your handy concierge.

00:18:13,251 --> 00:18:15,253
BRASS:
What were you doing
on that plane?

00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,588
I'm friendly with Harper.

00:18:16,654 --> 00:18:17,655
Friendly?

00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,257
Is that a job title

00:18:19,324 --> 00:18:23,428
or do you perform a specific
function for that distinction?

00:18:23,494 --> 00:18:24,996
( <i>laughing</i> ):
You don't get it.

00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,864
What, what...

00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:28,132
what's not to get?

00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:29,467
Uh, why don't you
help us,

00:18:29,534 --> 00:18:31,502
since you're so good
at getting things

00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:32,537
like Cuban cigars?

00:18:32,604 --> 00:18:34,038
Oh, come on.

00:18:34,105 --> 00:18:37,342
The embargo on Cuban cigars
is ridiculous.

00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,143
It's still the law.

00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,712
You break one law,
the chances are...

00:18:40,778 --> 00:18:43,848
I never went near Lori Hutchins.

00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,783
Well, we found
your prints

00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,419
on the rail going down
into the cargo hold.

00:18:50,455 --> 00:18:51,890
Look.

00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:53,758
I helped Harper out with a party

00:18:53,825 --> 00:18:55,660
at the Orpheus about a year ago.

00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:56,728
We hit it off.

00:18:56,794 --> 00:18:59,497
She started
inviting me to things.

00:18:59,564 --> 00:19:00,965
This is my first trip
on the jet.

00:19:01,032 --> 00:19:03,401
Now, I know I wasn't supposed
to go down there, but...

00:19:03,468 --> 00:19:05,870
all that stuff?

00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,043
Hey, hey, hey,
there, buddy.

00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,112
That's a $60 Cuban.

00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:21,452
I got the hell out of there,
and I kept my mouth shut.

00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:23,688
These people-- they don't
tolerate a buzz kill,

00:19:23,755 --> 00:19:24,789
and I'll be damned

00:19:24,856 --> 00:19:26,591
if I'm going to be shot
for being the messenger.

00:19:26,658 --> 00:19:28,026
So the happier
Harper stays,

00:19:28,092 --> 00:19:29,761
the fatter your pockets.

00:19:29,827 --> 00:19:31,930
I really don't like
to talk about money.

00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:34,299
How about we talk about DNA?

00:20:06,564 --> 00:20:08,132
Hello.

00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:10,501
You get anything
off of that dress?

00:20:10,568 --> 00:20:13,738
I think our girl was
a young Madame DeFarge.

00:20:13,805 --> 00:20:14,939
She made her own death shroud,

00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,574
but she didn't know
her own measurements.

00:20:16,641 --> 00:20:18,409
That's kind of freaky.

00:20:18,476 --> 00:20:19,410
Any results

00:20:19,477 --> 00:20:21,012
in the sexual assault
evidence kit?

00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:22,447
No, the kit
came back negative.

00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,315
The stomach contents
came back the same.

00:20:24,382 --> 00:20:26,584
Identical to Toby's:
burger, fries, and a shake.

00:20:26,651 --> 00:20:29,053
And, also, the drug
ratios were the same

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,422
for fentanyl and cisapride.

00:20:31,489 --> 00:20:33,224
You know what else
is freaky--

00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,993
her prints
were on his patch,

00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:36,661
and his prints were on hers.

00:20:36,728 --> 00:20:38,663
She was a willing participant
in all this.

00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:56,347
Why didn't we find any trash
at the crime scene,

00:20:56,414 --> 00:20:57,849
and why didn't we find a note?

00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,083
Well, you know, I read somewhere

00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,919
that only 15% of suicides
actually leave a note,

00:21:00,985 --> 00:21:03,254
but you would think, with all
the trouble they went through,

00:21:03,321 --> 00:21:04,355
they would want to be found.

00:21:04,422 --> 00:21:05,023
Together.

00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:06,824
Yeah, and after she was sedated,

00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,626
she crawls away from the scene?

00:21:08,693 --> 00:21:09,861
Why?

00:21:09,928 --> 00:21:12,463
LOCKWOOD:
Hey, girl's
library card

00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:15,833
matched a missing
persons report filed
today: Jill Frommer.

00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,335
Mom's coming in
to I.D. the body.

00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:20,838
SIDLE:
Do you recognize this dress?

00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,607
No.

00:21:22,674 --> 00:21:24,609
Did Jill take Home Ec,

00:21:24,676 --> 00:21:26,244
or like to sew...

00:21:26,311 --> 00:21:28,546
Jill? Please.

00:21:28,613 --> 00:21:32,016
No, Jill didn't
do anything domestic.

00:21:33,885 --> 00:21:37,021
You only realize
what you want to teach them

00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:38,556
after it's too late.

00:21:38,623 --> 00:21:40,058
LOCKWOOD:
Toby Wellstone...

00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:42,060
he lived with you
as a foster kid

00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:43,394
about five years ago?

00:21:43,461 --> 00:21:45,530
Yeah, for about a year,
and then I sent him back.

00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:47,165
Can I ask why?

00:21:47,232 --> 00:21:49,067
My husband died of cancer,

00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:51,469
and I couldn't handle
Toby alone.

00:21:51,536 --> 00:21:54,472
That boy was just
way out of control.

00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,007
And then about...

00:21:56,074 --> 00:21:59,477
about a year ago,
Jill brings him home.

00:21:59,544 --> 00:22:00,878
Mom, look
at Toby's back.

00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,013
He can't stay there.

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,083
It's not safe; you
have to help, please.

00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:06,351
And you did.

00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:09,153
It didn't seem
like I had any choice.

00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,589
I mean, the system didn't care.

00:22:11,656 --> 00:22:13,558
Mrs. Frommer,

00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,527
were Toby and your daughter
involved romantically?

00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:25,169
You know those moments
you look back on

00:22:25,236 --> 00:22:28,539
and you wish you'd chosen
door number two instead?

00:22:28,606 --> 00:22:32,877
My whole life feels like that.

00:22:32,944 --> 00:22:36,114
I got nothing left.

00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:44,022
To your knowledge, did, um, Jill
ever attempt suicide before?

00:22:44,088 --> 00:22:45,356
No.

00:22:45,423 --> 00:22:47,659
I mean, not that I know of,
but with that boy around,

00:22:47,725 --> 00:22:49,427
there's no telling
what he got her into.

00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:50,795
I... I called Social Services.

00:22:50,862 --> 00:22:52,797
I tried to get him
out of the house.

00:22:52,864 --> 00:22:55,099
He was on a list, but nobody
wants teenagers, you know?

00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,768
Just five and under.

00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,202
Mrs. Frommer,
we believe

00:22:58,269 --> 00:22:59,904
that Toby and
Jill had help.

00:22:59,971 --> 00:23:01,773
We'd like a list
of their friends.

00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:02,974
( <i>sad laugh</i> )

00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:04,242
Friends?!

00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,112
I think it's pretty clear

00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:12,650
that my daughter's life
was just way out of my hands.

00:23:12,717 --> 00:23:16,454
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:19,490
Blood on the paper towels
was the vic's, Lori Hutchins.

00:23:19,557 --> 00:23:21,526
Found DNA on another area,
however.

00:23:21,593 --> 00:23:23,228
Epithelials with two donors.

00:23:23,294 --> 00:23:24,229
By who?

00:23:24,295 --> 00:23:27,632
Well, the vic and...
someone else.

00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:28,900
Are you being cagey?

00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:31,669
I'm trying to transition
out of cagey.

00:23:31,736 --> 00:23:33,271
You got to round up
some more swabs.

00:23:33,338 --> 00:23:35,073
Neither Harpo...

00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:36,107
Harper.

00:23:36,174 --> 00:23:37,842
Whatev-o.

00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:39,143
Neither she

00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,845
nor Rhone Confer was a match.

00:23:40,912 --> 00:23:42,313
( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:23:44,182 --> 00:23:45,617
Yeah?

00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:53,258
I came as soon as
I got a call from the USDA.

00:23:53,324 --> 00:23:54,392
What happened?

00:23:54,459 --> 00:23:56,194
Chronic Metritis.

00:23:56,261 --> 00:23:57,662
Uterine infections.

00:23:57,729 --> 00:23:59,497
I opened up the caslicks.

00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:01,165
I tried antibiotics,

00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,134
saline lavage...

00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:05,937
I guess it was too little,
too late.

00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:14,245
I found a suture scissors near
Lori's body on the plane.

00:24:14,312 --> 00:24:17,382
Is it possible that she knew
about the infection

00:24:17,448 --> 00:24:19,083
and tried to relieve it?

00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,752
Well, it'd have to be critical

00:24:20,818 --> 00:24:23,354
for Lori to try
emergency surgery in the air.

00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:24,689
Define critical.

00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:26,724
Massive swelling...

00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:29,861
a threat to High Folly's
ability to foal.

00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:31,496
I believe we found

00:24:31,563 --> 00:24:33,331
our greater tragedy.

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,070
WOMAN:
Equine necropsy's a lot
like human autopsy.

00:24:46,137 --> 00:24:47,839
One organ at a time.

00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:49,440
Do you know, they're
a lot like us,

00:24:49,507 --> 00:24:51,843
except their constitutions
are even more sensitive.

00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:54,178
A horse can die
from indigestion.

00:24:54,245 --> 00:24:56,180
"A horse is dangerous
at both ends,

00:24:56,247 --> 00:24:58,116
and uncomfortable
in the middle."

00:24:58,182 --> 00:24:59,984
Who said that?

00:25:00,051 --> 00:25:01,185
Ian Fleming.

00:25:01,252 --> 00:25:03,821
Ah, James Bond fan, huh?

00:25:03,888 --> 00:25:05,923
I read the novels
when I was a kid.

00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,792
Well,

00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:09,527
the vet flushed
and dilated her,

00:25:09,594 --> 00:25:11,796
but her white blood cell count
was through the roof.

00:25:11,863 --> 00:25:13,564
You have any idea
what caused the infection?

00:25:13,631 --> 00:25:15,400
Hard to tell...

00:25:15,466 --> 00:25:17,368
but the uterus is
a highly-balanced

00:25:17,435 --> 00:25:19,470
environment, and an
infection can start

00:25:19,537 --> 00:25:22,640
with something as simple
as a speck of dirt.

00:25:24,175 --> 00:25:27,312
The uterine walls sense
a foreign body, and attack it.

00:25:34,018 --> 00:25:36,721
I thought the stitches
were used to prevent

00:25:36,788 --> 00:25:38,523
the invasion of foreign bodies.

00:25:38,589 --> 00:25:40,191
Well, they're
supposed to,

00:25:40,258 --> 00:25:42,193
but she's got
so much pyometra

00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,795
in her right
uterine horn,

00:25:43,861 --> 00:25:45,263
something got
in there.

00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:48,199
Unless a horse is

00:25:48,266 --> 00:25:50,802
opened up, you
can't actually
reach the horns.

00:26:01,112 --> 00:26:03,348
This is outside my purview.

00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,881
Uncut diamonds?

00:26:38,216 --> 00:26:40,985
The horse is a mule.

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,542
GIRL:
<i>Jill Frommer?</i>

00:26:43,542 --> 00:26:44,576
Dude, that girl was mental.

00:26:44,643 --> 00:26:45,744
I used to be friends

00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:46,979
with her in,
like, fifth grade.

00:26:47,045 --> 00:26:48,447
Sometimes I'd pick her up
before school,

00:26:48,514 --> 00:26:49,581
and she'd always

00:26:49,648 --> 00:26:51,416
be waiting outside,
like a dork.

00:26:51,483 --> 00:26:53,685
When was the last time
you saw Jill?

00:26:53,752 --> 00:26:55,821
Hmm, she hasn't been
at school all year.

00:26:55,888 --> 00:26:57,523
BLONDE:
I heard she switched schools

00:26:57,589 --> 00:26:58,991
to be with some guy.

00:26:59,057 --> 00:27:00,359
How lame.
Oh, like

00:27:00,425 --> 00:27:01,360
you wouldn't do it.

00:27:01,426 --> 00:27:03,228
Like, does this
dress look familiar?

00:27:03,295 --> 00:27:05,631
Oh, my God.

00:27:05,697 --> 00:27:08,267
That's the dress
that Alyssa made and wore

00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:09,535
to last year's
homecoming.

00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:10,669
BLONDE:
When she was fat?

00:27:10,736 --> 00:27:13,005
Ladies... who is Alyssa?

00:27:13,071 --> 00:27:14,206
Jamison.

00:27:14,273 --> 00:27:15,807
Aka GTS.

00:27:15,874 --> 00:27:17,309
Goody Two Shoes.

00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,777
When she's not out
saving the planet,

00:27:18,844 --> 00:27:19,778
she's healing the sick.

00:27:19,845 --> 00:27:21,146
What?

00:27:21,213 --> 00:27:23,849
She works as a "Volunteen"
at the hospital.

00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,825
( <i>beep</i> )

00:27:33,892 --> 00:27:35,761
Hello. How may I help you?

00:27:35,827 --> 00:27:37,396
Hi, there.
I'm Sara Sidle, and this

00:27:37,462 --> 00:27:38,297
is Warrick Brown.

00:27:38,363 --> 00:27:39,231
We're with the Crime Lab.

00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:40,966
Did you know Jill Frommer?

00:27:41,033 --> 00:27:42,134
Sure.

00:27:42,201 --> 00:27:43,402
SIDLE:
Did you happen

00:27:43,468 --> 00:27:46,471
to give her this dress?

00:27:46,538 --> 00:27:47,773
Yes.

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,842
BROWN:
Did you also
give her

00:27:49,908 --> 00:27:51,410
fentanyl and cisapride?

00:27:51,476 --> 00:27:53,745
Oh, my God!

00:27:53,812 --> 00:27:54,880
She...

00:27:54,947 --> 00:27:56,215
killed herself, didn't she?

00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:57,816
Yeah, she did.

00:27:57,883 --> 00:28:00,552
She gave me a necklace.

00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:01,920
Excuse me?

00:28:01,987 --> 00:28:04,323
Giving away sacred possessions.

00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:06,425
That's one of the sure signs
of suicide.

00:28:06,491 --> 00:28:08,894
She traded the necklace
for my dress.

00:28:08,961 --> 00:28:10,762
I told her she didn't have to,

00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:12,998
but she kept insisting.

00:28:13,065 --> 00:28:15,534
Said that she had something
special to wear the dress to,

00:28:15,601 --> 00:28:17,269
and the necklace would be
collateral.

00:28:19,104 --> 00:28:20,539
I took it as a good sign,

00:28:20,606 --> 00:28:22,841
because she'd been
so depressed lately.

00:28:22,908 --> 00:28:24,276
Did you give her any drugs,

00:28:24,343 --> 00:28:26,345
or-or give her access
to this pharmacy?

00:28:26,411 --> 00:28:30,115
I couldn't, even if I wanted to.

00:28:30,182 --> 00:28:32,284
Not that I ever would.

00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:45,664
According to his receptionist,

00:28:45,731 --> 00:28:47,132
Dr. Stevens...

00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:50,369
left town...

00:28:50,435 --> 00:28:51,470
unexpectedly.

00:28:51,537 --> 00:28:53,272
Really?

00:28:53,338 --> 00:28:54,673
Well, check this out.

00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,778
I don't think it's pixie dust.

00:29:00,946 --> 00:29:03,882
And...

00:29:03,949 --> 00:29:06,084
lots of red lentils.

00:29:06,151 --> 00:29:09,254
Supposedly used to keep
the diamonds from chipping.

00:29:15,127 --> 00:29:17,629
That Dr. Stevens
was very involved.

00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,831
Mmm.

00:29:23,235 --> 00:29:25,437
A horse's uterus is the size

00:29:25,504 --> 00:29:27,940
of a football,
so he could've packed it

00:29:28,006 --> 00:29:29,408
with pouches of diamonds.

00:29:29,474 --> 00:29:31,510
Why did he leave one behind?

00:29:31,577 --> 00:29:33,145
He took what he could reach.

00:29:33,212 --> 00:29:34,413
And ran.

00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:36,381
But he wasn't on that plane,

00:29:36,448 --> 00:29:37,516
so he couldn't have

00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:38,717
killed the girl.

00:29:38,784 --> 00:29:39,852
He had a partner.

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,742
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:30:05,811 --> 00:30:07,746
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:30:16,889 --> 00:30:18,957
Did you know that the term
"carat" comes

00:30:19,024 --> 00:30:21,293
from the Mediterranean
carob tree,

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,695
whose seeds were used
for centuries

00:30:23,762 --> 00:30:25,764
as a standard of measurement?

00:30:25,831 --> 00:30:28,066
No. Um...

00:30:28,133 --> 00:30:31,069
so, based on the

00:30:31,136 --> 00:30:33,906
six-to-one
lentil-to-diamond ratio

00:30:33,972 --> 00:30:35,340
in the packet we found,

00:30:35,407 --> 00:30:37,409
and assuming
that all the packets

00:30:37,476 --> 00:30:38,977
are the same size,

00:30:39,044 --> 00:30:42,714
I think we're looking for...
five more.

00:30:42,781 --> 00:30:44,349
Five?

00:30:47,052 --> 00:30:49,555
Well, yeah, based on weight,

00:30:49,621 --> 00:30:52,191
uh, we've established
that approximately 183 grams

00:30:52,257 --> 00:30:55,327
of lentils per pack...

00:30:55,394 --> 00:30:57,763
732 grams would be...

00:30:59,765 --> 00:31:02,134
Oh, my mistake. Four.

00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:07,206
Well, it's not 100% accurate,
but, uh...

00:31:07,272 --> 00:31:09,374
based on shape,

00:31:09,441 --> 00:31:10,642
color characteristics,

00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:14,446
wavelength absorptions
of the regional impurities...

00:31:14,513 --> 00:31:18,217
it says that these diamonds
come from Central Africa.

00:31:18,283 --> 00:31:21,486
Conflict diamonds?

00:31:21,553 --> 00:31:25,257
Don't those fund warlords
and support child slavery?

00:31:25,324 --> 00:31:27,426
Yeah. Bought for pennies
on the dollar,

00:31:27,492 --> 00:31:28,627
and banned by the UN.

00:31:28,694 --> 00:31:29,995
Well, that would explain

00:31:30,062 --> 00:31:31,430
why someone felt the need

00:31:31,496 --> 00:31:33,265
to smuggle them
into the country.

00:31:33,332 --> 00:31:35,634
That, and a half a million
dollars worth of luxury tax.

00:31:35,701 --> 00:31:37,636
No customs, no tax.

00:31:37,703 --> 00:31:39,738
And if Lori were
about to find out,

00:31:39,805 --> 00:31:42,407
explains why someone would want
to kill her.

00:31:42,474 --> 00:31:43,809
So we've got the how
and the why.

00:31:43,876 --> 00:31:46,578
We just need the who.

00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:55,945
BRASS:
Well, you travel
with a well-heeled crowd.

00:31:56,012 --> 00:31:57,780
I checked
everybody's passports.

00:31:57,847 --> 00:31:59,749
Man, you guys get around...

00:31:59,816 --> 00:32:02,251
but you're the only one
who's been to Sierra Leone.

00:32:02,318 --> 00:32:04,320
You know why I became a steward?

00:32:04,387 --> 00:32:07,223
I don't know, uh, see the world?

00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,324
Exactly.

00:32:08,391 --> 00:32:10,593
What'd you see in Sierra Leone?

00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,795
Well, that's
the joke.

00:32:12,862 --> 00:32:14,597
Free night in Amsterdam?
No, no.

00:32:14,664 --> 00:32:15,932
I went around the globe

00:32:15,998 --> 00:32:18,201
picking up packages
for the Fitzgeralds

00:32:18,267 --> 00:32:20,002
like a frickin'
bike messenger.

00:32:20,069 --> 00:32:22,338
"Oh, could you take
the plane to Rome...

00:32:22,405 --> 00:32:24,941
to Ghana... pick
something up for me?"

00:32:25,007 --> 00:32:26,476
Sounds like fun.

00:32:26,542 --> 00:32:28,544
What kind of stuff
did you pick up?

00:32:28,611 --> 00:32:29,612
Who knows?

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,547
Art, antiques.

00:32:31,614 --> 00:32:32,915
It's usually wrapped up.

00:32:32,982 --> 00:32:35,351
Look, I figure
I'm better off
not knowing,

00:32:35,418 --> 00:32:37,420
and it looks
like I was right.

00:32:37,487 --> 00:32:39,856
What was your beef with Lori,
the horse trainer?

00:32:39,922 --> 00:32:42,358
I don't have one.

00:32:42,425 --> 00:32:45,561
Oh, well, we got a stack
of bloody paper towels

00:32:45,628 --> 00:32:48,030
with your DNA on it
that says you do.

00:32:52,468 --> 00:32:53,903
I took them from her.

00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,138
Hey, Lori,

00:32:55,204 --> 00:32:56,606
dinner's ready.

00:32:56,672 --> 00:32:57,607
You okay?

00:32:57,673 --> 00:32:59,942
Yeah, the horse is just
really freaked out.

00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:00,977
Gave me a good one.

00:33:01,043 --> 00:33:02,178
Would you mind
taking these?

00:33:02,245 --> 00:33:03,246
Sure. No problem.

00:33:04,714 --> 00:33:07,583
I got buzzed into the bedroom.

00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,920
Mrs. Fitzgerald needed help
with her zipper.

00:33:10,987 --> 00:33:13,422
I threw the paper towels
in the wastepaper basket.

00:33:23,266 --> 00:33:25,268
That's a tidy little story.

00:33:29,605 --> 00:33:32,041
You know, Jill's
friends seemed like

00:33:32,108 --> 00:33:34,777
they were brainwashed...
or brain-dead.

00:33:34,844 --> 00:33:37,013
And Moms was absentee
at best, huh?

00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:38,614
Well, teenagers
are very suggestive.

00:33:38,681 --> 00:33:40,450
If Toby was the best thing
she had going,

00:33:40,516 --> 00:33:42,185
it's the biggest influence
in her life.

00:33:42,251 --> 00:33:43,352
Yeah.

00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:45,488
Don't even bother viewing
those surveillance tapes.

00:33:45,555 --> 00:33:47,356
No hospital's dispensed
cisapride in three years.

00:33:47,423 --> 00:33:48,357
SIDLE:
So that's it?

00:33:48,424 --> 00:33:49,759
The kids just magically got
the drugs

00:33:49,826 --> 00:33:51,127
and offed themselves,
end of story?

00:33:51,194 --> 00:33:52,195
SANDERS:
Not exactly.

00:33:52,261 --> 00:33:53,262
The white substance

00:33:53,329 --> 00:33:54,764
that you pulled
from Romeo's blanket

00:33:54,831 --> 00:33:55,998
and Juliet's dress...
Yeah?

00:33:56,065 --> 00:33:58,601
Denatured milk proteins
and mucoid saliva.

00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,504
Baby spittle.

00:34:01,571 --> 00:34:03,272
There was a baby out there.

00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:05,708
Not just any baby--
their baby.

00:34:05,775 --> 00:34:06,876
I pulled DNA.

00:34:06,943 --> 00:34:09,879
Two halves make a whole.

00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:28,531
Mom's credit card
showed a suit purchase

00:34:28,598 --> 00:34:30,700
in the young men's
department at JC Penney's.

00:34:30,767 --> 00:34:32,235
BROWN:
Oh, yeah?

00:34:32,301 --> 00:34:36,472
Looks like Moms is a personal
shopper and chauffeur, huh?

00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:37,974
Guess Moms is busy.

00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,243
Too busy to notice
a baby, apparently.

00:34:54,056 --> 00:34:56,259

Warrick...

00:35:49,946 --> 00:35:51,681
Cisapride and fentanyl--

00:35:51,747 --> 00:35:52,882
you care to explain this?

00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:54,817
My husband went through
chemo, I told you that.

00:35:54,884 --> 00:35:56,786
The fentanyl's
for my back pain.

00:35:56,853 --> 00:35:58,621
Why didn't you tell us
that Jill and Toby

00:35:58,688 --> 00:35:59,622
had access to these?

00:35:59,689 --> 00:36:01,491
MRS. FROMMER:
Jill, I'm going to lie down.

00:36:01,557 --> 00:36:03,493
Go get me those pills
for my back.

00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:05,461
You didn't ask.

00:36:09,198 --> 00:36:11,434
( <i>baby babbling</i> )

00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:38,094
Hi, baby.

00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:40,129
Hi, little baby.

00:36:43,399 --> 00:36:45,735
I'm this baby's only chance.

00:36:45,802 --> 00:36:47,170
Lady, you are
out of chances.

00:36:47,236 --> 00:36:48,704
Watching people
kill themselves

00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:50,373
isn't against the law
in Nevada.

00:37:04,587 --> 00:37:06,856
So you encouraged them
to take the pills.

00:37:06,923 --> 00:37:09,225
How much longer are you two
going to ruin my life, huh?

00:37:09,292 --> 00:37:10,460
How much longer?

00:37:10,526 --> 00:37:11,828
BROWN:
<i>You drove them</i>

00:37:11,894 --> 00:37:14,230

<i>after their last meal.</i>

00:37:14,297 --> 00:37:15,264
There's nothing like

00:37:15,331 --> 00:37:17,433
a little positive reinforcement,
is there?

00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,235
MRS. FROMMER:
<i>They were beyond saving.</i>

00:37:23,506 --> 00:37:26,242
Wait, Mom,
I changed my mind.

00:37:26,309 --> 00:37:27,910
I don't want to die.

00:37:27,977 --> 00:37:29,812
Mom! Mom!

00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:31,314
Please don't leave me!

00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,949
I think we can convince a jury

00:37:33,015 --> 00:37:34,817
that you did more
than just watch.

00:37:34,884 --> 00:37:37,453
Not helping a child in danger
is a misdemeanor.

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,255
You might as well write me
a parking ticket.

00:37:39,322 --> 00:37:40,790
We're going to write you up
on murder,

00:37:40,857 --> 00:37:42,492
and then I'm going to call
Child Services.

00:37:42,558 --> 00:37:43,593
Go ahead.

00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:45,128
I am next of kin,
and without a record,

00:37:45,194 --> 00:37:46,662
I'm going to get her back
in a second.

00:37:46,729 --> 00:37:48,531
Miss...

00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:51,701
It's okay.

00:37:51,768 --> 00:37:52,735
It's all right.
Hi.

00:37:52,802 --> 00:37:53,870
It's all going to be better

00:37:53,936 --> 00:37:54,904
with Door Number Two.

00:37:54,971 --> 00:37:57,573
That's right.

00:38:02,545 --> 00:38:05,314
You think we even
stand a chance?

00:38:06,516 --> 00:38:08,317
No.

00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:11,788
Hi... hey.

00:38:13,823 --> 00:38:14,957
What have you got?

00:38:15,024 --> 00:38:18,428
We got animal, mineral,
and now vegetable.

00:38:18,494 --> 00:38:19,462
What?

00:38:19,529 --> 00:38:22,899
I ran the trace on the remainder
of the diamonds.

00:38:22,965 --> 00:38:24,367
Lentils and carrots.

00:38:24,434 --> 00:38:25,968
Carrots on the karats.

00:38:26,035 --> 00:38:26,969
I'm thinking Lori

00:38:27,036 --> 00:38:27,970
packed the diamonds.

00:38:28,037 --> 00:38:29,872
After she fed the
horse, evidently.

00:38:40,716 --> 00:38:42,218
( <i>whinnying</i> )
That a girl.

00:38:42,285 --> 00:38:44,720
She was the only one
who got close to that horse.

00:38:44,787 --> 00:38:47,690
So Dr. Stevens didn't have
one partner, he had two.

00:38:47,757 --> 00:38:48,891
And Lori was the only one

00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:50,426
who knew
there was five packages,

00:38:50,493 --> 00:38:52,662
which would explain
why Stevens left one behind.

00:38:52,728 --> 00:38:54,664
She was a victim, but
she wasn't innocent.

00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,998
( <i>wry chuckle</i> )

00:38:56,065 --> 00:38:59,535
WILLOWS:
Okay, so, we've
got a dead woman,

00:38:59,602 --> 00:39:02,738
a dead horse,
a runaway vet, and...

00:39:02,805 --> 00:39:04,373
a couple million dollars worth

00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,576
of uncut diamonds
that are unaccounted for.

00:39:06,642 --> 00:39:09,812
Well, diamonds are worthless
unless you have a buyer.

00:39:09,879 --> 00:39:11,414
STOKES:
What if the vet
repackaged

00:39:11,481 --> 00:39:13,316
the diamonds,
took them with him.

00:39:13,382 --> 00:39:14,951
PD traced him
to the Caymans.

00:39:15,017 --> 00:39:16,752
But why would he smuggle
them into the country

00:39:16,819 --> 00:39:17,987
only to smuggle them out again?

00:39:19,255 --> 00:39:20,723
GRISSOM:
Flight steward's
story checks out.

00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,959
Lori Hutchins had
an ante-mortem gash

00:39:23,025 --> 00:39:24,293
on her right forearm.

00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,428

00:39:28,798 --> 00:39:30,533
Is there anyone
not on Harper's payroll?

00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,634
Well, you met her.

00:39:31,701 --> 00:39:33,603
Would you be her friend
for free?

00:39:33,669 --> 00:39:35,438
GRISSOM:
What about Harper?

00:39:35,505 --> 00:39:38,107
It was her plane,
Meredith's horse.

00:39:38,174 --> 00:39:39,976
She didn't care what
happened to the horse.

00:39:40,042 --> 00:39:42,311
Yeah, but she's got no reason
to smuggle diamonds.

00:39:42,378 --> 00:39:44,380
Reward's not worth the risk.

00:39:50,086 --> 00:39:51,487
Rhone Kinsey-Confer.

00:39:55,191 --> 00:39:58,261
Hey, what if we were thinking
about this whole thing

00:39:58,327 --> 00:40:00,596
a little too globally?

00:40:00,663 --> 00:40:02,698
I'm going to find out

00:40:02,765 --> 00:40:05,034
what Rhone's mother's
maiden name is.

00:40:05,101 --> 00:40:07,437
What's his mother
got to do with it?

00:40:07,503 --> 00:40:09,705
She may have sold me
my engagement ring.

00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,415
Las Vegas Police.
We have a search
and seizure warrant

00:40:19,482 --> 00:40:21,617
for any and all diamonds.

00:40:21,684 --> 00:40:23,119
I bought those diamonds.

00:40:23,186 --> 00:40:24,554
They're mine.

00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,788
What are you doing?

00:40:25,855 --> 00:40:27,256
Mrs. Kinsey,

00:40:27,323 --> 00:40:30,326
did you ever stop and think
that maybe your family discount

00:40:30,393 --> 00:40:31,828
was a little too good
to be true?

00:40:31,894 --> 00:40:34,230
Did you really think your son
mined those rocks himself?

00:40:34,297 --> 00:40:35,798
Come on.

00:40:35,865 --> 00:40:36,899
Think about it.

00:40:41,871 --> 00:40:45,308
Yeah, someone else's plane,
someone else's horse.

00:40:45,374 --> 00:40:46,642
What a good plan.

00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:48,411
Except you got caught.

00:40:48,478 --> 00:40:51,114
Why even bother

00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:54,117

you wanted at your disposal?

at the fruit
just out of reach.

00:40:59,122 --> 00:41:02,024
BRASS:
Except you couldn't do it
without Lori.

00:41:02,091 --> 00:41:04,560
My guess is her death
was an accident.

00:41:04,627 --> 00:41:06,095
GRISSOM:
Did she care more
about the horse

00:41:06,162 --> 00:41:07,330
than she did the diamonds?

00:41:07,396 --> 00:41:09,165
Can't you give her a pill
or something?

00:41:09,232 --> 00:41:10,199
I'm taking the diamonds out.

00:41:10,266 --> 00:41:11,033
No, you're not.

00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:11,934
We've come too far

00:41:12,001 --> 00:41:12,835
to have this fall apart now.

00:41:12,902 --> 00:41:14,203
It's not worth the horse's life.

00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,338
Yeah, well, it is to me.

00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:17,807
Prove it.

00:41:20,076 --> 00:41:21,611
Would you mind
taking off your shirt?

00:41:21,677 --> 00:41:23,112
I don't want to.

00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:27,750
Well, that's unfortunate,
because...

00:41:27,817 --> 00:41:29,218
your tax evasion allows us

00:41:29,285 --> 00:41:31,087
to expand your warrant.

00:41:31,154 --> 00:41:32,488
