(<i>applause</i>)

00:00:15,353 --> 00:00:16,354
(<i>clanging</i>)

00:00:17,856 --> 00:00:19,524
I need one volunteer
from the audience.

00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,265
You.

00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:29,167
In the blue dress.

00:00:42,213 --> 00:00:44,916
(<i>woman singing</i>
<i>mystical melody</i>)

00:00:48,253 --> 00:00:49,687
(<i>gasping</i>)

00:00:49,754 --> 00:00:52,290
Step into the box.

00:00:52,357 --> 00:00:54,859
Hands by your sides.

00:00:54,926 --> 00:00:56,461
Don't move.

00:00:56,528 --> 00:00:58,834
(<i>hissing</i>)

00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:43,910
And ladies
and gentleman

00:01:43,977 --> 00:01:45,846
I assure you
she's quite all right.

00:01:45,912 --> 00:01:47,948
In fact, she's...
Spotlight, please.

00:02:04,264 --> 00:02:06,299
(<i>whispering</i>):
I don't know where she is.

00:02:09,603 --> 00:02:11,738
(<i>chuckling</i>):
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:02:13,473 --> 00:02:15,642
I can't quite explain...

00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,335
Welcome to the house
of illusion.

00:02:26,402 --> 00:02:27,336
This is bizarre.

00:02:27,403 --> 00:02:29,438
You're not going
to believe this.

00:02:29,505 --> 00:02:32,841
Female volunteer goes
on the stage, disappears

00:02:32,908 --> 00:02:35,277
and doesn't
come back.

00:02:35,344 --> 00:02:37,813
Was she supposed
to... reappear?

00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,183
The Amazing Zephyr
won't say.

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,386
You know magicians,
they never reveal their tricks

00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:46,689
but we're working
on him.

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,062
Well, I can understand

00:02:53,128 --> 00:02:55,831
why he doesn't want
to reveal his trick...

00:02:57,766 --> 00:03:00,035
but would he
like to explain

00:03:00,102 --> 00:03:01,375

of police officers, uh

00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:38,927
canvassing the
theater right now.

00:03:38,994 --> 00:03:40,929
No sign yet, but we
have traced the woman

00:03:40,996 --> 00:03:42,698
back to her
aisle seat, 8A.

00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:44,032
Paid cash.

00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,102
Magic is fun, Jim,
but it's not real.

00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:49,371
The woman is somewhere.

00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:50,439
Thanks for that. Thanks.

00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:51,540
Excuse me.
Yeah?

00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,942
Um, hi, are we finished here?

00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:56,311
No. You were sitting in front
of the volunteer, right?

00:03:56,378 --> 00:03:58,614
You take any photos
during the show?

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,149
We're going
to need your camera.

00:04:00,215 --> 00:04:01,717
But our whole trip's
on there.

00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,118
We'll get the negatives
back to you. Michael.

00:04:03,185 --> 00:04:04,987
Excuse me.
Thanks for your help.

00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,927
Dull as a spoon.

00:04:11,994 --> 00:04:13,562
From a distance,
it looks razor-sharp.

00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,763
That's the point.

00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,165
So is it real blood?

00:04:16,231 --> 00:04:17,766
Well, let's see.

00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:24,306
That's real blood,
all right.

00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:27,309
Nothing is as it seems, is it?

00:04:28,777 --> 00:04:30,679
That's the conflict
of magic--

00:04:30,746 --> 00:04:34,116
the burden of knowledge
versus the mystique of wonder.

00:04:34,183 --> 00:04:36,385
And you're wondering
right now--

00:04:36,452 --> 00:04:38,687
I can hear
your mind ticking--

00:04:38,754 --> 00:04:42,024
"Was she a plant?
Was it real?"

00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:43,926
Well, there are no
secrets, are there?

00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,294
Only hidden answers.

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,929
I'm an honest liar, sir.

00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,163
In my line of work

00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,164
it's accepted.

00:04:49,231 --> 00:04:51,133
You could say
it was my livelihood.

00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,535
Well, my livelihood
is dispelling lies

00:04:53,602 --> 00:04:55,838
and finding
the truth.

00:04:55,904 --> 00:04:58,841
My secrets can't be revealed
by any microscope.

00:04:58,907 --> 00:05:03,345
Yeah... but there's
a woman missing.

00:05:07,883 --> 00:05:09,385
The only thing missing...

00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,056
...is this.

00:05:14,123 --> 00:05:15,424
Very nice.

00:05:16,592 --> 00:05:18,193
So, where'd she go?

00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,995
From the salt in my marrow,
I don't know.

00:05:20,062 --> 00:05:21,864
I mean, I can't give you this

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,833
but I can
give you... that.

00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:31,440
It's as real
as my answer.

00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,212
No, you can keep it.

00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,834
WILLOWS:
What's the name
of the band again?

00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:46,838
STOKES:
Pekinpah. Back in '93,
first album was a moderate hit.

00:05:46,905 --> 00:05:50,242
Don't you remember that song,
it was pretty popular--

00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,743
uh... "Symphony
of Epiphanies"?

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,078
♪ Na, na, na,
na, na, na ♪

00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,147
♪ Come here,
come here... ♪

00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:59,885
(<i>speaking indistinctly</i>)

00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:01,586
Yeah, that was good
to dance to.

00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:02,721
MAN:
He's been laying

00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:04,422
in the back of the bus
for half an hour now.

00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,191
STOKES:
I'm guessing
that's the road manager.

00:06:06,258 --> 00:06:08,026
He does not look
too happy.

00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:10,796
Well, he just lost
a lead singer.

00:06:16,868 --> 00:06:20,005
Ooh...
rock and roll, baby.

00:06:26,445 --> 00:06:27,846
Gus Kenyon.

00:06:27,913 --> 00:06:29,414
It's a shame, man.

00:06:29,481 --> 00:06:31,516
He had a good voice.

00:06:34,052 --> 00:06:35,987
WILLOWS:
Heroin.

00:06:36,054 --> 00:06:39,157
If this was an overdose,
why leave some in the syringe?

00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:41,693
No vomit around, either.

00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,528
That's a first for me.

00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,933
Wait a second,
what's this?

00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:50,268
Doesn't look like
a bruise.

00:06:50,335 --> 00:06:51,770
How'd he do that?

00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:53,004
What's that?

00:06:53,071 --> 00:06:54,172
The tourniquet.

00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:57,042
He's obviously
left-handed

00:06:57,109 --> 00:06:58,610
if he shot up in the right arm.

00:06:58,677 --> 00:07:00,011
If he tied it off himself

00:07:00,078 --> 00:07:03,482
he would have pulled
it towards him, like so.

00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,417
It's tied the other way,
pulled away from him.

00:07:09,521 --> 00:07:11,823
By someone else
standing over him?

00:07:16,128 --> 00:07:19,397
Easy... if you're incapacitated.

00:07:19,464 --> 00:07:20,799
You people seen enough?

00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:22,167
When can I put him
to rest?

00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,069
You really shouldn't be in here,
sir.

00:07:24,136 --> 00:07:25,070
Hey, look, I'm sorry.

00:07:25,137 --> 00:07:26,071
You know, this is a tragedy

00:07:26,138 --> 00:07:28,073
for all of us,
and his family.

00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,342
I just don't want the press
to see him like this.

00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,711
We understand that, sir,
but this is a crime scene.

00:07:32,778 --> 00:07:34,312
Crime scene?

00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:35,914
It's an O.D., right?

00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:37,382
He killed himself.

00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:39,050
Then you knew
he was a drug user?

00:07:39,117 --> 00:07:40,719
Well, he <i>was</i> a drug user.

00:07:40,786 --> 00:07:42,254
I mean, he's been clean

00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,722
for a long time.

00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:45,390
A health freak,
actually.

00:07:45,457 --> 00:07:47,626
It's a shock to us all.

00:07:49,294 --> 00:07:53,198
Big glass box and all I got
is a partial thumb print.

00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:55,300
Is this
processed yet?

00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:58,170
Yeah. Want me
to bag it for you?

00:07:58,236 --> 00:07:59,771
Let's take it back
to the lab.

00:07:59,838 --> 00:08:01,606
Maybe we can make
Greg disappear.

00:08:01,673 --> 00:08:04,142
Who controls this
stage, do we know?

00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:05,510
MAN:
I do.

00:08:08,346 --> 00:08:09,381
And you are...?

00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,750
Punky Dillinger. I'm
Zephyr's stagehand.

00:08:11,817 --> 00:08:13,051
Well, Mr. Dillinger

00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,786
do you know how
this trick works?

00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:17,622
I only control
the stage part.

00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:20,759
Yeah.

00:08:20,826 --> 00:08:22,027
Good.

00:08:22,094 --> 00:08:23,662
Make me disappear.

00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:28,567
(<i>hissing</i>)

00:08:30,102 --> 00:08:31,236
Bye-bye.

00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,129
Oh, I get it.

00:08:59,197 --> 00:09:02,000
There's a chute
inside the steps.

00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,303
Still here.

00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,740
At this point
of the trick

00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:11,009
I'm supposed
to escort the volunteer

00:09:11,076 --> 00:09:12,344
out of the basement.

00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,513
Now I only turned my back
for a second and she was gone.

00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:16,581
Is there any other way out
of here besides that door?

00:09:16,648 --> 00:09:18,517
No, that's the thing.
Stage left's the only exit.

00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,352
I don't know.

00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,855
You have any lights
in here besides red?

00:09:23,922 --> 00:09:25,123
We're looking
for blood.

00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,191
Mm-hmm.

00:09:29,594 --> 00:09:31,930
Oh, hey? Hey?!

00:09:31,997 --> 00:09:33,765
Those are Zephyr's tricks
in the corner.

00:09:33,832 --> 00:09:35,300
No one's allowed to go near them

00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,735
not even me.

00:09:43,675 --> 00:09:48,113
I've got ovoid blood drops
leading towards the wall.

00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,681
You guys want
more lights?

00:09:49,748 --> 00:09:52,150
No. Turn them off.

00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,948
Magicians of Zephyr's caliber

00:10:23,014 --> 00:10:25,083
belong to a very
secluded society.

00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:28,487
They barnstorm
from city to city...

00:10:28,553 --> 00:10:30,722
no contact
with the outside world

00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:34,926
no association
with other magicians.

00:10:34,993 --> 00:10:37,362
They're like ghosts with skin.

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,667
This looks like

00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:44,603
an admixture of blood

00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:46,772
and some sort of clear liquid.

00:10:46,838 --> 00:10:48,807
Someone bolted out
of here pretty fast.

00:11:03,355 --> 00:11:05,423
I'm no psychic,
but I have been known

00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,459
to read palms.

00:11:07,526 --> 00:11:08,527
Hey!

00:11:08,593 --> 00:11:10,295
I got a print.

00:11:10,362 --> 00:11:11,630
You're kidding me.

00:11:11,696 --> 00:11:12,798
Nope.

00:11:12,864 --> 00:11:14,566
No heroin
in his system.

00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,701
Lots of bourbon,
but no heroin at all.

00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:17,569
So what killed him?

00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:18,870
Embolism to the heart.

00:11:18,937 --> 00:11:20,472
Air bubble.

00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:21,807
I withdrew air

00:11:21,873 --> 00:11:23,074
from his
right ventricle

00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,976
and air can be
deadlier the heroin.

00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:27,512
<i>It travels through the vein</i>
<i>into the right ventricle</i>

00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:30,148
<i>to prevent blood from entering</i>
<i>or leaving the chamber</i>

00:11:30,215 --> 00:11:32,217
<i>which eventually leads</i>
<i>to heart failure.</i>

00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:34,820
WILLOWS:
<i>Shock. Suffocation.</i>

00:11:34,886 --> 00:11:36,822
Explains why
he didn't throw up.

00:11:36,888 --> 00:11:39,090
And why his pupils
weren't pinpoint.

00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,392
They would have been

00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:42,494
bilaterally small
after an overdose.

00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:43,895
There was heroin
still in the needle.

00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:45,397
Why didn't it
make it into his system?

00:11:45,464 --> 00:11:47,833
His blood alcohol count was .31.

00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:52,070
My guess is he was unconscious
before his heart stopped.

00:11:52,137 --> 00:11:54,306
Catherine, wait.

00:11:54,372 --> 00:11:55,841
That black mark...

00:11:55,907 --> 00:11:58,477
Oh, right, on
his index finger.

00:11:58,543 --> 00:11:59,544
Ink.

00:11:59,611 --> 00:12:01,713
Standard black
printing ink.

00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:17,996
SIDLE:
<i>The stagehand was lying</i>
<i>about another exit.</i>

00:12:18,063 --> 00:12:19,931
I got his palm print
off the trap door.

00:12:19,998 --> 00:12:21,433
BROWN:
Try this one.

00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,702
It's a print from
the "Chamber of Doom."

00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,785
Hands on the trap door?

00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:41,887
Hands inside the trick?

00:12:41,953 --> 00:12:44,055
There are no secrets.

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,001
Mmm.
Hey, hey, hey.

00:12:47,068 --> 00:12:50,204
This is a non-smoking facility.

00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:17,220
I'm not a bad magician,
you know.

00:13:17,287 --> 00:13:19,189
When you find that,
put that out.

00:13:20,624 --> 00:13:22,593
Okay.

00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:24,595
Truth is... I lied.

00:13:24,661 --> 00:13:25,596
We know that.

00:13:25,662 --> 00:13:27,264
That's why we're here.

00:13:27,331 --> 00:13:31,501
I love magic, you know?

00:13:31,568 --> 00:13:33,503
One of the fringe benefits
of my job

00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,005
is knowing how the tricks work.

00:13:35,072 --> 00:13:36,940
Zephyr wouldn't
let anyone go
near his tricks.

00:13:37,007 --> 00:13:38,976
You think I want
to be a stagehand

00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:40,177
the rest of my life?

00:13:40,244 --> 00:13:42,613
I got aspirations,
too, you know?

00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,181
So, I snooped
around.

00:13:44,248 --> 00:13:46,283
Climbed inside the "Chamber"
one night

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,584
and tried it out.

00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:49,453
Is that a crime?

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,022
We don't know yet.

00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:54,024
The videotape
from last night's show

00:13:54,091 --> 00:13:56,026
has you...

00:13:56,093 --> 00:13:58,195
wearing this.

00:13:58,262 --> 00:13:59,963
So what?

00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,498
So, it was used
as a tourniquet

00:14:01,565 --> 00:14:02,833
on Gus's arm.

00:14:04,034 --> 00:14:05,869
Look, I-I was with these guys

00:14:05,936 --> 00:14:07,471
the entire night
last night.

00:14:07,537 --> 00:14:09,973
Okay.

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,209
When was the last time
you saw him alive?

00:14:12,276 --> 00:14:14,311
On the bus last night
after the show.

00:14:14,378 --> 00:14:16,246
He said he wanted
to be left alone

00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,514
so we left him alone.

00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:19,216
We finished the set
with, uh

00:14:19,283 --> 00:14:20,150
"City of Sin."

00:14:20,217 --> 00:14:22,753
You know, the hometown pleaser.

00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:24,388
He always hated that song.

00:14:24,454 --> 00:14:25,455
I don't know why.

00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:26,757
It was his best one.

00:14:26,823 --> 00:14:30,427
I talked to your manager,
and he said Gus was clean.

00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,662
Yeah.

00:14:31,728 --> 00:14:33,797
The whole band
for six years now.

00:14:33,864 --> 00:14:35,899
We-we did it together
as a band.

00:14:35,966 --> 00:14:37,334
You know, we kind of had to.

00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:38,735
We went gold
three months

00:14:38,802 --> 00:14:40,771
after we signed
our first contract.

00:14:40,837 --> 00:14:42,172
The next couple
of years

00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:43,840
got pretty crazy.

00:14:43,907 --> 00:14:45,275
Crazy?

00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,277
Dude, hit single

00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,079
24 years old.

00:14:49,146 --> 00:14:50,080
Touring with Pearl Jam.

00:14:50,147 --> 00:14:51,181
I mean

00:14:51,248 --> 00:14:52,916
Gus had bitches lining up

00:14:52,983 --> 00:14:55,352
outside of his room
24 hours a day.

00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:57,120
Sleep ain't
an option.

00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,089
So, by your next gig,
you're going

00:14:59,156 --> 00:15:00,791
you know, need a little bop.

00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:03,360
I obtained Gus's

00:15:03,427 --> 00:15:04,761
medical records
from L.A.

00:15:04,828 --> 00:15:06,997
that said he
was treated
for depression.

00:15:07,064 --> 00:15:08,999
You guys know
anything about that?

00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:12,169
Sober suits some better
than others.

00:15:12,236 --> 00:15:13,170
He could get
pretty dark.

00:15:13,237 --> 00:15:14,171
I mean,
sometimes

00:15:14,238 --> 00:15:16,173
you couldn't even speak
with him, you know?

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,708
He's been wanting out

00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:19,743
for some time now.

00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:24,982
I know you didn't beep
me for a magic trick.

00:15:25,048 --> 00:15:27,284
Swami doesn't do
magic tricks.

00:15:27,351 --> 00:15:31,488
Swami's here to reveal all
of your DNA secrets.

00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,624
I'm very busy, Greg.

00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,194
Blood from the
"Chamber of Doom."

00:15:37,261 --> 00:15:39,496
Same as the donor
of the blood

00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:42,332
found on the
basement floor

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,167
but different than
the blood found

00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,836
in the alleyway.

00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:46,737
Different person?

00:15:46,803 --> 00:15:48,472
Different...

00:15:48,538 --> 00:15:49,840
animal.

00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,441
Really?

00:15:51,508 --> 00:15:52,843
What kind of animal?

00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,545
Oh, Swami needs more time.

00:15:55,612 --> 00:15:57,314
Now...

00:15:57,381 --> 00:15:59,316
clear liquid

00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:00,951
found near the blood droplets.

00:16:02,786 --> 00:16:07,391
It's not
from Thora Birch, but...

00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:09,526
Thorazine.

00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,727
Thorazine.

00:16:10,794 --> 00:16:12,396
Thorazine.

00:16:12,462 --> 00:16:13,697
That's an animal
tranquilizer.

00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,732
Zephyr didn't use any
live animals in his act.

00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:18,302
Maybe he didn't use it
on animals.

00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,478
GRISSOM:
Whoa.

00:16:28,545 --> 00:16:30,514
Go back one, Arch.

00:16:30,581 --> 00:16:32,316
Is that her?

00:16:32,382 --> 00:16:33,917
Blue dress, red hair.

00:16:35,052 --> 00:16:36,787
Go on.

00:16:38,822 --> 00:16:40,190
Is that who
I think it is?

00:16:40,257 --> 00:16:41,525
Who?

00:16:46,263 --> 00:16:48,098
JOHNSON:
Toby Arcane.

00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:49,199
Freak man.

00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:50,500
What makes him a freak

00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:52,035
besides that shirt?

00:16:52,102 --> 00:16:53,203
All I can say

00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,205
he's not for the
faint of heart.

00:16:56,707 --> 00:17:01,745
(<i>banging and whirring</i>)

00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:06,450
(<i>yelling and cheering</i>)

00:17:06,516 --> 00:17:08,986
(<i>punk music racing</i>)

00:17:27,371 --> 00:17:28,772
(<i>music stops</i>)

00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,277
(<i>music resumes</i>)

00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,054
(<i>flame roaring</i>)

00:17:46,323 --> 00:17:48,625
(<i>applause and cheering</i>)

00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,666
(<i>music ends</i>)

00:17:55,732 --> 00:17:58,035
(<i>applause and cheering</i>)

00:17:58,101 --> 00:18:02,005
It's, uh, called
"The Cross-ifixion."

00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:04,207
I get, uh, nailed to it
every night.

00:18:04,274 --> 00:18:06,310
Well, miraculously,
you've resurrected.

00:18:07,844 --> 00:18:09,179
Have you ever been
to the Zephyr show?

00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:11,448
He's a hack.

00:18:11,515 --> 00:18:13,550
I wouldn't be caught dead
at that show.

00:18:13,617 --> 00:18:14,918
I know.

00:18:14,985 --> 00:18:17,154
But we caught you alive.

00:18:19,957 --> 00:18:20,958
You should see

00:18:21,024 --> 00:18:22,292
my nudes, Grissom.

00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:24,294
(<i>laughs</i>)

00:18:24,361 --> 00:18:26,129
The, uh, woman
who disappeared--

00:18:26,196 --> 00:18:27,864
do you think she was a plant?

00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:29,032
Of course she's a plant.

00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:30,667
Zephyr's on life support.

00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,536
His way of
doing magic--

00:18:32,603 --> 00:18:34,705
it's dead as, uh...

00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:36,206
dead.

00:18:36,273 --> 00:18:39,209
Fooling people
from a hundred feet away.

00:18:42,045 --> 00:18:44,214
'Cause I'm in your face.

00:18:45,649 --> 00:18:47,084
Right here.

00:18:48,986 --> 00:18:52,256
We have reason
to believe

00:18:52,322 --> 00:18:53,624
that that woman,
planted or not

00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,691
sustained injury during

00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,160
<i>the first insertion</i>
<i>of the saber.</i>

00:18:57,227 --> 00:18:58,795
Do you think
it was part of the act

00:18:58,862 --> 00:19:00,864
or do you think
it was some kind of mistake?

00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,401
Uh, yeah, could have been
a blood pouch

00:19:04,468 --> 00:19:06,136
but knowing him...

00:19:06,203 --> 00:19:07,404
it was a mistake.

00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:08,672
Is it possible

00:19:08,739 --> 00:19:11,041
that he put his saber
into the wrong slot?

00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,376
Well

00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,578
this is Vegas, baby.

00:19:14,645 --> 00:19:16,079
The band's last two albums,
and the DVD.

00:19:16,146 --> 00:19:17,881
You know, I heard
that they were splitting up.

00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,416
Where did you hear that?

00:19:19,483 --> 00:19:21,151
Uh, the New World Library--
Internet.

00:19:21,218 --> 00:19:22,686
This contains, uh,
TV appearances

00:19:22,753 --> 00:19:24,221
live footage, things like that.

00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,756
He wrote every song.

00:19:25,822 --> 00:19:26,557
Who, the singer, Gus?

00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,624
His name's on every title.

00:19:27,691 --> 00:19:28,725
If they were
splitting up

00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,860
and he took his songs back

00:19:29,927 --> 00:19:31,995
no more Pekinpah,
no more money for the band.

00:19:32,062 --> 00:19:34,131
Why don't you get back
on the Internet for us?

00:19:34,197 --> 00:19:36,700
See if there's any gossip
floating around.

00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:39,069
We need to get back
to the crime scene.

00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,404
I'm looking for ink.

00:20:05,128 --> 00:20:07,397
I showed the road manager
a copy of the warrant.

00:20:07,464 --> 00:20:08,565
He went nuts.

00:20:08,632 --> 00:20:10,667
He's on the phone with
his lawyer right now.

00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:13,170
Why do they want us off this bus
so badly?

00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:35,292
Standard printing ink.

00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,301
What to do

00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,037
when your cell phone's
not working.

00:20:58,949 --> 00:21:00,951
Empty.

00:21:03,921 --> 00:21:05,255
(<i>rapping on glass</i>)

00:21:05,322 --> 00:21:06,623
This doesn't work.

00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,059
Seems like nothing
on that bus does.

00:21:09,126 --> 00:21:12,429
Yeah, but this doesn't work,
'cause the batteries suck.

00:21:13,864 --> 00:21:15,566
Oh.

00:21:15,632 --> 00:21:16,767
Belongs to the guitarist.

00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,635
Looks like
Mr. Clean and Sober had a habit.

00:21:18,702 --> 00:21:21,538
Bet it matches that smack
we found on the needle.

00:21:21,605 --> 00:21:24,074
Yeah. You, uh,
trying to make a call?

00:21:24,141 --> 00:21:25,275
No...

00:21:25,342 --> 00:21:26,577
but somebody did.

00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,553
Got a smudged name.

00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,689
"Dean."

00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,994
(<i>beeping</i>)

00:21:44,061 --> 00:21:45,262
BROWN:
Goodyear Wrangler.

00:21:45,329 --> 00:21:47,030
Ford F-150.

00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,099
Hallelujah.

00:21:50,534 --> 00:21:52,135
Did a DNA profile
on your blood.

00:21:52,202 --> 00:21:53,237
Ran it through CODIS.

00:21:53,303 --> 00:21:54,238
Guess who I found?

00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,405
Who?

00:21:55,472 --> 00:21:56,406
Zoe Clein.

00:21:56,473 --> 00:21:57,608
White Caucasian.

00:21:57,674 --> 00:21:58,742
Female.

00:21:58,809 --> 00:21:59,910
Red hair.

00:21:59,977 --> 00:22:01,078
Wait a minute.

00:22:01,144 --> 00:22:02,546
CODIS? What database?

00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:03,447
Missing persons.

00:22:03,513 --> 00:22:04,681
She's in the
database already?

00:22:04,748 --> 00:22:05,682
Yeah. She's been

00:22:05,749 --> 00:22:06,850
in there for six months.

00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:08,285
Same time she's been missing.

00:22:08,352 --> 00:22:09,987
Brass is working on an address.

00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,424
Nice house.

00:22:14,491 --> 00:22:16,426
(<i>train whistle blowing</i>)

00:22:16,493 --> 00:22:18,428
Built it so
close to the
railroad.

00:22:18,495 --> 00:22:20,697
(<i>knocking</i>)

00:22:20,764 --> 00:22:23,300
I bet this house was here first.

BROWN:
It's a little
too calm.

00:22:42,552 --> 00:22:43,820
Yeah.

00:22:43,887 --> 00:22:47,057
I'll take upstairs.

00:22:48,692 --> 00:22:50,961
(<i>door closing</i>)

00:23:11,081 --> 00:23:12,849
Wow.

00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:13,750
What?

00:23:13,817 --> 00:23:15,819
Six pints of "A" positive.

00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:20,157

(<i>door creaking</i>)

00:23:52,022 --> 00:23:54,091
Hey, guys?

00:23:56,193 --> 00:23:58,061
Zoe's bedroom seems intact.

00:23:58,128 --> 00:24:00,163
Suitcases, purses, clothes.

00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,665
It looks like she never left.

00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:02,900
(<i>door closing</i>)

00:24:07,104 --> 00:24:09,106
Guys?

00:24:41,071 --> 00:24:42,839
(<i>screams</i>)
Sorry.

00:24:42,906 --> 00:24:44,041
You keep
disappearing.

00:24:46,143 --> 00:24:49,012
Take a look at this.

00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:51,782
SIDLE:
Huh. Looks like
the "Chamber of Doom."

00:24:51,848 --> 00:24:53,717
Designed by Zoe Clein.

00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:56,086
SIDLE:
So, she's an inventor.

00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:09,366
Hey, guys,
check out this old photo.

00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:11,668
The Clein Magical Tour.

00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:16,974
The one with beard
must be the father.

00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,475
SIDLE:
Zoe Clein

00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:19,643
the daughter.

00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,744
Young Zephyr...

00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,413
What's he doing there?

00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,049
And who's that baby
in his arms?

00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:28,858
What up, G?

00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,518
Well, I did my
snooping around.

00:25:30,585 --> 00:25:33,154
Obviously everyone's
upset about Kenyon croaking.

00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,684
And?

00:25:34,751 --> 00:25:36,386
And they were planning
a "Best of..." album.

00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:37,453
No surprise.

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,355
Cash cow,
everybody does it.

00:25:39,422 --> 00:25:42,225
Well, someone e-mailed me
a clip of Gus on MTV2

00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:43,893
a few months ago.

00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,762
(<i>laughing</i>)

00:25:45,828 --> 00:25:48,865
GUS:
Compilation albums
are for has-beens.

00:25:48,932 --> 00:25:51,935
They can release one
over my dead body.

00:25:52,001 --> 00:25:55,171
As long as I'm alive, I'm going
to continue to write originals.

00:25:55,238 --> 00:25:57,073
Who's planning the album?

00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,975
Keith Castle.

00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:00,209
The guitarist?

00:26:00,276 --> 00:26:01,044
Mm-hmm.

00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,645
I'm chasing the smack.

00:26:02,712 --> 00:26:04,781
I'm chasing the phone book.

00:26:26,402 --> 00:26:27,437
Warrick, come here.

00:26:30,406 --> 00:26:32,508
What is that,
a butterfly?

00:26:32,575 --> 00:26:33,576
A male Io moth.

00:26:33,643 --> 00:26:35,144
One of the largest
in North America.

00:26:35,211 --> 00:26:36,145
How'd it get in here?

00:26:36,212 --> 00:26:38,348
I don't know. It feeds
on trees and foliage.

00:26:38,414 --> 00:26:39,916
There's none of that in here.

00:26:39,983 --> 00:26:42,252
See the eye-like spots
on the back of its wings?

00:26:42,318 --> 00:26:44,654
It's an illusion
to confuse predators.

00:26:44,721 --> 00:26:47,724
Birds get fooled
into thinking it's an owl.

00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:50,093
I have a similar one
in my office.

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,061
(<i>creaking</i>)

00:26:55,098 --> 00:26:56,165
Didn't we release

00:26:56,232 --> 00:26:58,167
Officer Henderson?

00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:08,278
Hello?

00:27:18,254 --> 00:27:20,323
Hello?

00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:46,282
(<i>shouting</i>)

00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:46,950
Hold up! Back up!

00:27:47,016 --> 00:27:47,650
I really didn't...

00:27:47,717 --> 00:27:48,318
Warrick!

00:27:48,384 --> 00:27:49,319
Hey! Back up.

00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:56,459
Look, I got a family, okay?

00:27:56,526 --> 00:27:57,827
They think
I'm clean.

00:27:57,894 --> 00:27:59,028
The band, too.

00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:00,763
Did you give some
to Gus last night?

00:28:02,065 --> 00:28:03,066
Needle, too?

00:28:03,132 --> 00:28:04,634
No, no,
no, man.

00:28:04,701 --> 00:28:06,269
I don't shoot up.

00:28:06,336 --> 00:28:07,637
That's just for snorting.

00:28:08,738 --> 00:28:09,672
Well, Keith...

00:28:09,739 --> 00:28:12,609
think Gus would get
messed up enough

00:28:12,675 --> 00:28:14,077
to kill himself?

00:28:14,143 --> 00:28:15,245
That'd help you sell

00:28:15,311 --> 00:28:17,013
a few more albums,
wouldn't it?

00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,081
Gus is dead, okay?

00:28:18,147 --> 00:28:19,949
You never had
the pleasure
of finding out

00:28:20,016 --> 00:28:22,051
what an ass he was in person.

00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:24,220
Yeah, we made some
money off his talent

00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:26,556
but he made us feel worthless.

00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:27,924
At least when
he was high

00:28:27,991 --> 00:28:30,093
he'd shut up.

00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:37,767
(<i>doorbell chimes</i>)

00:28:46,576 --> 00:28:48,544
(<i>doorbell chimes</i>)

00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:56,152
Samantha Dean?

00:28:56,219 --> 00:28:58,488
I'm with the Las Vegas
Crime Lab.

00:28:58,555 --> 00:29:00,657
Do you know Gus Kenyon?

00:29:00,723 --> 00:29:04,093
Gus Kenyon looked up
your number and address

00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,328
in this directory

00:29:05,395 --> 00:29:07,397
and, uh, called you
last night...

00:29:07,463 --> 00:29:10,633
from a phone booth
outside of his tour bus.

00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,470
Records indicate the call
was made around 2:00 a.m.

00:29:14,537 --> 00:29:16,639
I must have been asleep.

00:29:16,706 --> 00:29:19,008
It lasted 20 seconds.

00:29:19,075 --> 00:29:20,577
I didn't answer.

00:29:20,643 --> 00:29:21,911
So it rang?

00:29:21,978 --> 00:29:23,613
No, I mean, I can't remember.

00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,315
We're both in bed by 9:00.

00:29:27,317 --> 00:29:28,618
What's your son's name?

00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:29,586
Brandon.

00:29:29,652 --> 00:29:30,753
You a mother?

00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,157
Yeah, yeah,
I have a, a daughter

00:29:34,224 --> 00:29:35,792
who is nine.

00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:38,695
Yeah, I know how hard
it is to do it alone.

00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:43,166
Now those are some cool
shades Brandon has on.

00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:45,868
Are those Silhouettes?
Those are expensive.

00:29:45,935 --> 00:29:47,971
Um, do you have
any more question

00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:50,640
because, uh, Brandon needs
to go to my mother's.

00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:51,874
I have to go to work.

00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:53,743

working for the Zephyr?

MATILDA:
A year.

GRISSOM:
What are
you doing here?

00:30:28,811 --> 00:30:32,549
I came to talk to Zoe,
and the door was open

00:30:32,615 --> 00:30:34,717
so I thought I'd snoop
around a little.

00:30:34,784 --> 00:30:36,719
BRASS:
A lot of people are
snooping around these days.

00:30:36,786 --> 00:30:40,123
You know, everybody
who works for the Zephyr

00:30:40,189 --> 00:30:41,824
wants to be
a magician. How come?

00:30:41,891 --> 00:30:43,793
'Cause we do everything.

I work my butt off
for that guy.

Bring this out,
bring that out

00:30:51,067 --> 00:30:53,002
keep proper timing,
inspect the tricks.

00:30:53,069 --> 00:30:55,138
You know, follow his lead.

00:30:55,204 --> 00:30:59,142
Zoe is the best inventor
in the business.

00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:01,477
You know, she sells me
just one of her tricks

00:31:01,544 --> 00:31:03,179
and I can be in business myself.

00:31:03,246 --> 00:31:05,014
So you know Zoe Clein.

00:31:05,081 --> 00:31:06,683
Through Zephyr. Yeah.

00:31:06,749 --> 00:31:07,850
Was she
a plant

00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:10,620
the night she disappeared?

00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:11,621
Yeah.

00:31:11,688 --> 00:31:12,922
It's one of
her stipulations

00:31:12,989 --> 00:31:15,091
that she's the volunteer

00:31:15,158 --> 00:31:16,659
opening night.

00:31:16,726 --> 00:31:17,527
Zoe Clein
has been missing

00:31:17,594 --> 00:31:18,861
for six months.

00:31:18,928 --> 00:31:20,597
And you saw her
the night she...

00:31:20,663 --> 00:31:22,232
disappeared.

00:31:25,401 --> 00:31:26,970
How do you explain that?

00:31:27,036 --> 00:31:29,973
I don't know.

00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:31,007
By the way

00:31:31,074 --> 00:31:32,008
how'd you get here?

00:31:32,075 --> 00:31:33,042
Drove.

00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:35,011
My car's parked
down the street.

00:31:35,078 --> 00:31:36,179
What kind of car
do you drive?

00:31:36,246 --> 00:31:38,114
A Ford F-150.

00:31:38,181 --> 00:31:40,183
Ford F-150.

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,562
It's a match.

Well, at least we know

00:31:58,301 --> 00:31:59,168
the animal.

00:32:00,303 --> 00:32:01,170

this is P-4981.

What did they do?

Drug her and feed her
to the panther?

00:32:23,893 --> 00:32:24,861
There.

00:32:24,928 --> 00:32:26,796
What?

00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:28,131
There.

00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:29,432
Where?

00:32:29,499 --> 00:32:31,000
Samantha Dean.

00:32:31,067 --> 00:32:33,236
She knows him.
She's backstage with him.

So?

See that VIP pass
around her neck?

00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:40,610
That's like diamonds.
Really?

00:32:40,677 --> 00:32:42,111
Hmm.

00:33:08,204 --> 00:33:10,173
Was it a red door?

00:33:15,712 --> 00:33:16,980
Kick ass.

00:33:19,349 --> 00:33:20,884
MATILDA:
Sadie's my cat.

00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,352
She's my pet.

00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:23,820
I got her from a previous gig.

00:33:23,887 --> 00:33:24,821
Zephyr hates animals

00:33:24,888 --> 00:33:26,756
so I just keep her in
my truck during the show.

00:33:26,823 --> 00:33:28,892
I let her out between shows
so she can get some air

00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:30,426
and she cut her leg
on the tailgate.

00:33:30,493 --> 00:33:31,494
So I sedated her.

00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:37,834
Can I go?

00:33:37,901 --> 00:33:39,369
I've got a lot
of work to do.

00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:40,603
Tonight's a really big night.

00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:41,938
We're sold out
for the first time

00:33:42,005 --> 00:33:43,373
and Zephyr's debuting
a new trick.

00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:45,875
Really? New trick.

I know you all
want to disappear.

00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:08,197
But tonight,
there'll be no sabers

00:34:08,264 --> 00:34:09,699
no surprises

00:34:09,766 --> 00:34:11,668

It's been rigged.

With a metal stake.

nailed to the cross.

00:35:17,726 --> 00:35:19,495
He's got external burns

00:35:19,561 --> 00:35:22,598
covering approximately
80% of his body.

00:35:22,665 --> 00:35:25,501
Majority are second-
and third-degree.

00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:27,870
Extensive damage
to his hands.

00:35:27,937 --> 00:35:29,338
Curled and closed.

The human body
protecting its prints.

00:35:31,607 --> 00:35:33,309
You're going to have
a tough time

00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:35,177
finding anything
substantial here.

00:35:35,244 --> 00:35:37,079
Better run his dental
records, then, huh?

00:35:37,146 --> 00:35:38,013
Yeah, sure.

00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,415
COD?

00:35:39,481 --> 00:35:40,849
Laryngeal spasm.

00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:42,585
We usually see this
in drownings.

00:35:42,651 --> 00:35:45,387
Only instead of swallowing
water, he swallowed fire.

00:35:45,454 --> 00:35:47,523

and that leads to immediate
unconsciousness and death.

00:35:57,633 --> 00:36:00,536
Another example of the body
trying to protect itself.

00:36:00,603 --> 00:36:03,138
And, uh, I'd say in this case,
it didn't work.

00:36:03,205 --> 00:36:04,673
Unusual, though.

00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:08,911
Not as unusual
as what I found in his mouth.

00:36:08,978 --> 00:36:13,816
Surgically created soft tissue
pouches within the gingivae.

00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:16,051
It's like pockets of skin.

00:36:16,118 --> 00:36:17,453
In the lining.

00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:18,621
I've never seen
this before.

00:36:18,687 --> 00:36:19,622
Neither have I.

00:36:19,688 --> 00:36:21,924
I knew that Houdini
could swallow

00:36:21,991 --> 00:36:23,892
and regurgitate
keys on cue

00:36:23,959 --> 00:36:26,228
but I've never heard
of skin pockets.

Okay.

that I'm bleeding.

Look

00:37:22,051 --> 00:37:23,385
it doesn't suit me

00:37:23,452 --> 00:37:24,620
to kill Zephyr.

00:37:24,687 --> 00:37:27,690
See, I've been killing him
for years.

00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:30,326
Come on, people, this is magic.

Look at this.

Even this tattoo.

On earth.

You're welcome.

00:37:51,313 --> 00:37:53,249
SAMANTHA:
This is ridiculous.

00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:55,050
I don't even
own a stereo.

00:37:55,117 --> 00:37:57,086
So, you never met
Gus Kenyon?

00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:58,087
No.

00:37:58,153 --> 00:37:59,288
You sure?

00:37:59,355 --> 00:38:00,756
We know he
was here.

00:38:00,823 --> 00:38:02,758
We matched the paint
from your door

00:38:02,825 --> 00:38:04,326
to the pain on Gus's ring.

00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:09,732
And it's not so much
that this girl

00:38:09,798 --> 00:38:11,900
in the photograph looks
exactly like you.

00:38:11,967 --> 00:38:13,903
It's that,
the sunglasses that Gus

00:38:13,969 --> 00:38:16,906
is wearing... familiar?

00:38:16,972 --> 00:38:19,541
Of course not.

00:38:19,608 --> 00:38:21,010
Very rare, custom-made

00:38:21,076 --> 00:38:24,813
graduated lenses.

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,783
Your son is holding them
in his hands.

00:38:30,753 --> 00:38:32,988
Were they a gift to him?

00:38:33,055 --> 00:38:36,325
No.

00:38:36,392 --> 00:38:38,260
He has
his father's eyes.

00:38:38,327 --> 00:38:40,896
The two of you met
on a video shoot

00:38:40,963 --> 00:38:42,765
in Vegas six years ago.

Honey, it's okay.

00:39:07,489 --> 00:39:10,793
You've changed a lot
since your days with Gus.

You were protecting your son

00:39:14,129 --> 00:39:15,764
from his father's
lifestyle.

00:39:15,831 --> 00:39:18,400
Miss Dean, you're a registered
nurse, is that correct?

00:39:18,467 --> 00:39:22,972
That means you
have access to
medical supplies.

00:39:23,038 --> 00:39:24,940
Needles?

<i>He said he just passed out</i>

But you, you've been around
heroin before, haven't you?

00:39:37,653 --> 00:39:40,322
You know how
to cook it.

00:39:40,389 --> 00:39:44,260
Did you think you put
just enough in the syringe

00:39:44,326 --> 00:39:46,328
to make it look
like a suicide?

00:39:46,395 --> 00:39:48,197
Am I under arrest?

00:39:49,665 --> 00:39:50,833
No.

No, we're just here
for your son's DNA.

00:39:53,002 --> 00:39:56,138
Then I think I should hire
a lawyer.

00:39:57,172 --> 00:39:59,141
I just have one other thing,
Miss Dean.

00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:03,212
I'm just guessing that when
you found out you were pregnant

00:40:03,279 --> 00:40:06,015
that you stopped listening
to Gus's band

00:40:06,081 --> 00:40:10,019
and that you haven't heard
any of his latest songs.

loved you very much

But I fooled them all.

00:45:34,109 --> 00:45:36,011
Even that ungrateful masochist.

00:45:36,078 --> 00:45:39,448
ZEPHYR:
You, in the blue dress.

00:45:39,515 --> 00:45:40,683
Who's he kidding?

00:45:40,749 --> 00:45:41,884
That's a plant.

00:45:43,285 --> 00:45:44,520
That was a plant.

00:45:44,587 --> 00:45:46,855
It-It's amazing

00:45:46,922 --> 00:45:51,260
what you can do with a stagehand
and a masquerade mask.

00:45:51,327 --> 00:45:53,896
You know, not to mention a prop

00:45:53,963 --> 00:45:55,497
like a packet full
of Zoe's blood.

00:45:58,968 --> 00:46:00,536
You know,
lucky for me

00:46:00,603 --> 00:46:03,872
she let me have some before
she mysteriously disappeared.

00:46:03,939 --> 00:46:05,874
You made her disappear.

00:46:06,909 --> 00:46:09,411
No, I assumed her.

00:46:19,622 --> 00:46:20,789
Quick-change artistry.

00:46:20,856 --> 00:46:22,224
A magical transformation.

00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:24,126
With a good seamstress
and some Velcro...

00:46:24,193 --> 00:46:26,328
We know that you switched
with your son, Punky

00:46:26,395 --> 00:46:27,930
to set up Toby Arcane

00:46:27,997 --> 00:46:29,765
for your murder.

00:46:29,832 --> 00:46:31,667
That trick didn't work
so well, did it?

00:46:31,734 --> 00:46:34,003
Not as planned.

00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:37,339
And your finding me here
has thwarted my transmutation.

00:46:37,406 --> 00:46:39,575
Abracadabra.

00:46:39,642 --> 00:46:41,677
Abracadabra.

00:46:41,744 --> 00:46:43,312
That's a cabalistic charm

00:46:43,379 --> 00:46:46,048
said to be made up
from three Hebrew words

00:46:46,115 --> 00:46:48,717
meaning, father, son
and the holy spirit.

00:46:48,784 --> 00:46:50,920
You're the father

00:46:50,986 --> 00:46:52,888
who took his son's life...

00:46:52,955 --> 00:46:57,059
so that you could disappear
and become the holy spirit?

00:46:57,126 --> 00:46:58,961
No.

00:46:59,028 --> 00:47:02,965
From caterpillar
to cocoon.

00:47:03,032 --> 00:47:05,134
From cocoon

00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,969
to moth.

00:47:07,036 --> 00:47:09,705
And from moth...

00:47:12,207 --> 00:47:13,609
...to dust.

00:47:18,847 --> 00:47:22,051
Your son aspired to be
a great magician, didn't he?

00:47:22,117 --> 00:47:24,153
Yeah, but he served better
as a prop.

00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:27,222
You're about to be arrested
for his murder.

00:47:27,289 --> 00:47:29,158
You don't want to know
how I did that trick?

00:47:29,224 --> 00:47:30,426
No.

00:47:30,492 --> 00:47:33,729
Magicians shouldn't reveal
their tricks.

00:47:33,796 --> 00:47:37,466
And they say they save
their best trick for last.

00:47:40,502 --> 00:47:43,739
Officer?

00:47:45,074 --> 00:47:46,175
Officer, wait a minute.

00:47:46,242 --> 00:47:49,011
Turn him around, please.

00:47:51,247 --> 00:47:52,881
Open your mouth, please.

00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:05,127
Satisfied?

00:48:05,194 --> 00:48:07,730
Yeah.
