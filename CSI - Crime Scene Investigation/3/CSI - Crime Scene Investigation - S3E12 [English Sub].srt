00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,128
I don't think I can get
a clear shot.

00:00:45,162 --> 00:00:46,730
It's a peregrine
falcon.

00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,699
No, it's not.
It's a hawk.

00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:50,634
You can't see anything
this time of day.

00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:52,036
We should come back at dawn.

00:00:52,102 --> 00:00:53,737
But I'm so behind
on my life list.

00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,673
I still don't have
a western wood-pewee

00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:56,583
or a solitary sandpiper.

00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:57,834
What, do you think
they're going to kick you

00:00:57,834 --> 00:00:58,625
out of the club?

00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,333
John saw
a dickcissel
earlier today.

00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:01,301
It could be
gone tomorrow.

00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:02,335
John's full of...

( <i>cawing</i> )

00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:06,553
Corvus corax.

00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:08,188
A common raven?

00:01:08,254 --> 00:01:09,823
So what?

WILLOWS:
That's not all
they're missing.

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,458
You know, ravens, like
eagles, have been known

00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:36,161
to travel 30 miles from
roost to feeding ground.

00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,704
30 miles in every direction.

And what about the iris?

Color distinction

less than 48 hours.

Yeah, I sent some

Can you get me
an eye for an eye?

Well, I've got foil

a leaf, a feather
and plastic.

00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:23,016
Feathers.

00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,951
For warmth.

00:04:25,018 --> 00:04:26,086
Seagull feathers.

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,923
Well, the only place
we'd have seagulls around here

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,024
would be Lake Mead.

00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:33,693
But only when the fishing's
good.

00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,429
And we got some
ground limestone.

00:04:37,797 --> 00:04:39,833
Not found at Lake Mead.

00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:44,504
You know, ravens
are incredibly intelligent.

00:04:44,571 --> 00:04:47,741
They have a brain capacity
comparable to dolphins.

00:04:47,807 --> 00:04:50,076
Means they know where to shop.

00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:51,378
We found the eye here.

00:04:51,444 --> 00:04:53,480
I bet she shopped here

00:04:53,547 --> 00:04:57,284
where limestone is used
as ground cover.

You know the average Nevadan
generates more waste

00:05:11,698 --> 00:05:15,168

than the average American?

Yeah, well,
that's tourist trash.

00:05:17,704 --> 00:05:19,573
13 million
pounds per day.

00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:22,409
I went to the recycling forum
in March.

The landfill manager says
this is the active cell.

00:05:25,812 --> 00:05:28,381
Spotter says cell lift
moves forward 20 feet a day.

00:05:28,448 --> 00:05:30,617
That puts the active cell
right...

00:05:30,684 --> 00:05:32,619
pretty much
in front of us.

you throw away.

an onion

Well, this onion
is our time line

so peel back accordingly.

The electrolyte and glucose
levels in the eye were normal.

Obviously.

All right.

Oh, yeah.

00:09:19,913 --> 00:09:21,314
I got a torso and head.

00:09:26,786 --> 00:09:28,922
how hot do you think it is,
underneath all this trash?

00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:30,891
STOKES:
I don't know,
what do you think--

00:09:30,957 --> 00:09:32,125
ballpark at 120 degrees?

00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:34,361
So this is yesterday's trash.

00:09:34,427 --> 00:09:35,428
Dead body.

00:09:35,495 --> 00:09:36,730
Minimum 18 hours
in this heat.

00:09:36,796 --> 00:09:38,198
She should be
totally bloated.

00:09:38,265 --> 00:09:39,599
Yeah, she's not.

00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,434
Yeah, she's really torn up.

Bulldozers are vicious.

00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,111
Yeah, I think they only finished
the job.

00:09:51,177 --> 00:09:52,512
How did she get here?

00:09:57,617 --> 00:09:59,786
Heard you got to be
superhero today.

00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:03,123
I consider myself
a superhero every day.

00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,725
Got anything on
Our Lady of the Dump?

00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:07,727
COD is still indeterminate.

00:10:07,794 --> 00:10:10,297
Blunt force trauma
is a possibility.

00:10:10,363 --> 00:10:11,831
She has some
perimortem bruising

00:10:11,898 --> 00:10:13,600
around the left eye.

00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,068
But limb removal

00:10:15,135 --> 00:10:16,136
is relatively clean.

00:10:16,203 --> 00:10:17,137
Definitely postmortem.

00:10:17,204 --> 00:10:20,140
So we've got no arms, no prints.

00:10:20,207 --> 00:10:23,076
What kind of identifying
characteristics do we have?

00:10:23,143 --> 00:10:24,644
Second degree midline
episiotomy scar.

00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:26,146
Well, that
narrows it down

00:10:26,213 --> 00:10:28,648
to more than half the
women in this country
who gave birth.

00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:30,150
But there might be
one other thing.

00:10:30,217 --> 00:10:31,451
At first I thought

00:10:31,518 --> 00:10:32,852
appendectomy,
but check out

00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,154
her X ray.

00:10:34,221 --> 00:10:35,889
She's had surgery.

00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:37,924
Some kind of implant

00:10:37,991 --> 00:10:39,593
at the L4-L5 interspace.

00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:41,962
I'll know more
when I open her up.

You're my hero, Al.

00:10:45,765 --> 00:10:47,467
All right,
what do we know?

00:10:47,534 --> 00:10:50,871
That all of this trash
was found around the victim.

00:10:50,937 --> 00:10:54,474
And she was buried
with some very expensive trash.

00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,443
Yeah, there's nothing wrong

00:10:56,509 --> 00:10:57,677
with this frying pan.

00:10:57,744 --> 00:10:59,512
Could've gone to
Goodwill or someplace.

They weren't shopping at Costco.

00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:11,458
They paid way too much
for ice cream.

00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:45,659
with a titanium coating

00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:48,662
and an ultra high molecular
weight polyethylene component.

00:11:48,728 --> 00:11:50,931
An artificial
spinal disc.

00:11:50,997 --> 00:11:52,766
If you can recreate
a spine

00:11:52,832 --> 00:11:54,801
the possibilities
are endless.

00:11:54,868 --> 00:11:57,504
I thought, uh, disc
replacement surgery

00:11:57,571 --> 00:11:59,506
involved fusing
bone to bone.

00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:02,175
Eh, typically,
but it can limit mobility.

00:12:02,242 --> 00:12:03,176
With that little disc,

00:12:03,243 --> 00:12:04,978
your body doesn't know
the difference.

00:12:05,045 --> 00:12:07,547
<i>Matches range of motion,</i>
<i>flexibility</i>

00:12:07,614 --> 00:12:10,450
<i>and an axial rotation</i>
<i>of a normal spine.</i>

00:12:10,517 --> 00:12:12,152
Still in clinical trials.

00:12:12,219 --> 00:12:14,187
Less than
a thousand surgeries

00:12:14,254 --> 00:12:16,590
have been performed
in this country.

00:12:16,656 --> 00:12:18,491
Oh, well,
I like those odds.

00:12:18,558 --> 00:12:20,627
You'll like this even better.

00:12:20,694 --> 00:12:24,064
Medium endplate, size 12,
polyethylene component

00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,832
and a six-degree
lordosis angle.

00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:27,234
Narrowed it down to one.

00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,702
Amy Ennis.

00:12:28,768 --> 00:12:30,637
Austin, Texas.

00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:32,205
Tourist?

00:12:32,272 --> 00:12:33,640
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:12:33,707 --> 00:12:36,042
That's for you
to find out.

00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,351
Hey, is this all of them?

00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:50,555
WILLOWS:
Yeah, every last one
on Storm Cloud Lane.

00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:52,757
SIDLE:
Cans are on
private property,

00:12:52,824 --> 00:12:54,091
it's not trash day,

00:12:54,158 --> 00:12:55,393
how did you get consent?

00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:57,595
I talked to the president
of the owner's association.

00:12:57,662 --> 00:12:58,729
What'd you threaten her with?

00:12:58,796 --> 00:13:00,031
A return visit.

00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:04,569
Hey, guys?

00:13:04,635 --> 00:13:05,770
I got blood.

00:13:05,837 --> 00:13:07,071
Yeah.

00:13:07,138 --> 00:13:08,506
Yeah me, too.

00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:11,075
WILLOWS:
Well, that makes five.

00:13:11,142 --> 00:13:13,811
Let's see if
any of it's human.

00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:36,634
These two are human.

00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:46,310
If the vic was in here

00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:48,513
blood would have pooled
to the bottom.

00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:54,218
Yeah, and blood
dripped down the
side of this one

00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:56,487
<i>as the hydraulic</i>
<i>arm dumped it.</i>

00:13:56,554 --> 00:13:58,156
( <i>clanking</i> )

00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,792
This is our can.

00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:05,229
And that's our house.

00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:08,399
You found blood...
in <i>my</i> trash can?

00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:10,250
Any idea how it
got there?

00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,353
No.

00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,889
Do you know an
Amy Ennis from
Austin, Texas?

00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,891
No.

00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,293
So, you have absolutely
no idea what I'm
talking about?

00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:25,732
Dad... you all right?

00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,167
I'm fine.

00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:28,335
What's going on?

00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:30,337
I'm just asking your father
a few questions.

00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:31,972
Why don't you go inside
and make some dinner?

00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,106
What are you in the mood for?

00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,342
Whatever you want.

00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:39,646
Charlie, homework.

00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,415
Hey. Get the job?

00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,083
Later.

00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,918
Divorced?

00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:45,952
Yeah.

00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,921
Five years.

00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:50,157
I hear David's
resurrecting
the dead now.

00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,693
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Yeah, our little
miracle worker.

00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,194
I just came from
the hospital.

00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:56,530
That guy's in ICU with
respiratory paralysis.

00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,498
I did get a prelim
on his blood work--

00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,068
looks like some sort
of an organic poison.

00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,103
Well, that would explain
the discoloration

00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,604
Robbins found
around his mouth.

00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,306
MAN:
I'm telling you,
this is great.

00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:07,574
You're going
to love this.

00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:09,776
30 miles to the gallon,
very low maintenance.

00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:11,378
Your people are
going to love it.

00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:13,213
You know what?
I want you to tell them

00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,481
to throw away
the manuals.

00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:15,582
Call me for anything.

00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,851
Marty Gibson doesn't
close a sale,

00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:19,453
he opens a
relationship.

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,754
That guy's a charmer.

00:15:20,821 --> 00:15:22,789
Yeah, real Ricky Roma.

00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:25,993
( <i>dog yipping in distance</i> )

00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:30,297
May I help you, gentlemen?

00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:31,898
I'm Warrick Brown,
this is Gil Grissom.

00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:33,734
We're from the Las
Vegas Crime Lab.

00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,735
Oh. Nanci Linden.

00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:35,802
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:37,471
We have a warrant

00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:38,805
to search your premises.

00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:40,641
What for?
For evidence
concerning

00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,309
the attempted murder
of Fred Stearns.

00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:45,112
Oh, he had a heart attack.

00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:47,381
He's dead.

00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,583
No, he didn't...

00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,451
and he's not.

00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:53,186
( <i>dog barks</i> )

00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:54,688
Gigi, shush.

00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:55,856
Shh!
( <i>whimpers</i> )

00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:56,890
I'm sorry.

00:15:56,957 --> 00:16:00,827
I'm not supposed
to bring her in here.

00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:02,996
( <i>whispering</i> )

00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,235
So, this was...

00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:09,603
<i>is</i> Fred's desk.

00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,072
Nobody's touched it
since they took him away.

00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,073
It's bad luck.

00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,008
Middle desk
is Marty Gibson.

00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:17,477
The one on the end
is Clyde Hinton.

00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,680
Thank you.

00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,785
Poison could've
come from

00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,187
any of these
sources here.

00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:28,455
Oral fixation

00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:29,556
you think?

00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:32,426
Constant need
for gratification?

00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,427
In every way.

00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,462
This guy was like
the monster closer.

00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:39,833
You ever buy
a brand-new car, Griss?

00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,134
Depreciation
doesn't make it

00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:42,536
a logical investment.

00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:44,071
It's not about logic.

00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,806
It's about that <i>smell.</i>

00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,874
There's nothing like the smell
of a brand-new car.

00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:49,977
How right you are.

00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:50,978
Marty Gibson.

00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:54,481
We're not buying,
we're looking.

00:16:54,548 --> 00:16:56,249
If we need any help

00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:57,451
we'll let you know.

00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,087
Sometimes it's not
about what you need,

00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,655
sometimes it's about
what you <i>want.</i>

00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:47,334
GRISSOM:
You always, uh,

00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,002
lock your drawers?

00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:52,072
Huh.

Warrick Brown.

00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:07,287
I get it.
You're the funny guy.

00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:09,723
You know the definition
of "kismet," Mr. Grissom?

00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:13,460
Do you know the definition
of attempted murder, Mr. Hinton?

00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:14,895
Just go with me for a second.

00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,196
Go with you where?

00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,832
Come on... "kismet."

00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:21,034
Fate, or destiny

00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:24,738
from the Arabic word meaning
to distribute, or divide up.

00:18:24,805 --> 00:18:26,039
Smart guy.

00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,508
Destiny is what
you make of it.

00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:30,243
It's what gets distributed to me

00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,246
while the other guy's
washing the stain off his lips.

00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,849
<i>Well, boys, just closed</i>
<i>another fatty.</i>

00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,752
<i>Two hours of schmooze--</i>
<i>I can't lose.</i>

00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:39,619
<i>Your lips.</i>

00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:41,588
<i>Clyde!</i>

00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:42,489
<i>Don't worry, Freddy.</i>

00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:44,291
<i>I'll handle the client.</i>

( <i>laughs</i> )

00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:49,930
Look, everyone tries to get
an edge in this business.

00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:51,565
I use jokes.

00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:53,333
Fred Stearns
just passed away.

00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,035
Again.

00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:02,776
Dead guy. Not funny.

00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,815
Okay, David, take two.

00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:15,389
No luck on Amy Ennis's
next of kin.

00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,424
The Austin PD
is still working on it.

00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:18,659
Well, we know that
she had a kid.

00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:19,660
Well, she gave birth.

00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:21,261
That doesn't mean
that she had a kid.

00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,063
So, what, we've
got nothing?

00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,465
We have a Mercury Sable,
uh, Texas plates,

00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:28,035
found in the lot
of the Tangiers hotel.

00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:29,336
She's the registered
owner.

00:19:29,403 --> 00:19:30,671
They're bringing
it in now.

00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:47,487
If the poison was
administered orally

00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:50,957
I may know
how it got into
the bloodstream.

00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:54,161
Gastric ulcer.

00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:56,563
<i>In a healthy, functioning</i>
<i>stomach</i>

00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,565
<i>mucosa lines the walls</i>

00:19:58,632 --> 00:20:00,133
<i>and prevents</i>
<i>the hydrochloric acid</i>

00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,302
<i>from burning the organ itself.</i>

00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,603
<i>But if</i> h. pylori <i>gets in there,</i>

00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,072
<i>sends the whole system</i>
<i>off-balance,</i>

00:20:05,138 --> 00:20:08,575
<i>stops the mucosa,</i>
<i>and causes an ulcer.</i>

00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:11,278
Opens a direct channel
from your digestive tract

00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:13,013
straight into
your bloodstream.

00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:16,717
I know a lot about
stress-related ailments.

ROBBINS:
Any word yet
on a poison?

00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:22,055
Tox screen ruled out
the ink gum.

00:20:22,122 --> 00:20:24,191
It could've been
a factor, though.

00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:26,259
Uh, gum churns up
stomach acid--

00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:27,661
instant
inflammation.

00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:29,429
I don't care about
his indigestion, Doc.

00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:30,931
We need to know what killed him.

00:20:30,998 --> 00:20:33,166
Well, she wasn't in town
on business.

00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,101
What's that?

00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,336
( <i>clicking tongue</i> )

00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,504
Oh!

00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:39,406
Depends on what
her business was, I guess.

( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:47,247
Nothing risquÃ© about
the rest of her wardrobe.

00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:49,483
Maybe she got it here.
She could've met somebody,
you know.

00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:54,721
STOKES:
Okay, I'm going
to fume.

00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:17,411
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:20,180
( <i>two beeps</i> )

00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:21,548
( <i>tapping key</i> )

00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:24,318
According to Greg, the hairs
and the DNA from the toothbrush

00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:25,385
are a match to the vic.

00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,020
What about the prints
from her car?

00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:28,855
I thought I messed it up,
so I ran it twice.

00:21:28,922 --> 00:21:31,224
No errant prints,

00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,492
all a match to
the same woman.

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,627
Amy Ennis.

00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:35,162
No "Amy Ennis"
in the database.

00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:37,064
Well, Amy Ennis is our vic.
It's her car.

00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,333
Prints came back
to somebody named
Kelly Easton.

00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:41,802
WILLOWS:
Kelly Easton...

00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:43,236
Easton...

00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:44,738
174 Storm Cloud Lane?

00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:46,073
What's the first
thing you do

00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,574
when you don't want
to be found?

00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:49,509
Leave town.
Yeah...

00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:51,178
and change your name.

00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:54,982
WILLOWS:
...want to Mulligan
on your first story?

00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:56,350
"Divorced"?

00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,752
EASTON:
What the hell was
I supposed to say?

00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:01,421
My wife went out
to get her hair done

00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:02,923
and never came home.

00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,059
Well, maybe you gave her
a reason to leave.

00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:07,995
Spousal abuse,
cheating...

00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:09,363
Aw, you people.

00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:12,432
You know, you were
here five years ago

00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:15,535
with your grid searches,
your dogs, your cadets--

00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:17,204
you came up empty.

00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,940
You give me a good reason
why my wife left me,

00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:22,042
I'd love to hear it,

00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:24,111
because I tried
the truth.

00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,812
I didn't know
what happened.

00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:28,882
You know what
I got for it?

00:22:28,949 --> 00:22:31,251
They all think
I killed my wife.

00:22:31,318 --> 00:22:34,054
Her parents sued me
for custody.

00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:36,456
I lost my job,
my friends.

00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,291
Only thing I got left

00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,460
are those kids
and this house.

00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,462
Okay, you didn't
kill her.

00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,598
At least back then.

00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:31,094
I don't think
these belong to Dad.

00:23:33,229 --> 00:23:35,465
Could place Mrs. Easton
at the house.

00:23:35,532 --> 00:23:37,701
She came back
about a month ago.

00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:39,502
Doorbell rings...

00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:43,940
Huh, what do you say?

00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:45,942
Hi.

00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,811
( <i>chuckling</i> )

00:23:47,877 --> 00:23:49,512
SIDLE:
You tell me.

00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:51,681
Whatever it is,
it must've worked.

00:23:51,748 --> 00:23:53,617
She was back in your bedroom.

00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:56,386
Well, they say time
heals all wounds.

00:23:56,453 --> 00:23:58,088
It's crap.

00:23:58,154 --> 00:24:00,557
I hate her for what
she did to us,

00:24:00,624 --> 00:24:02,692
but I swear, it was
the first time

00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:04,794
I felt anything in five years.

00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,995
CHARLIE:
<i>So, she's really dead?</i>

00:25:12,062 --> 00:25:13,997
Yeah.

00:25:14,064 --> 00:25:15,632
Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:25:15,699 --> 00:25:17,000
Figures.

00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:17,901
How's that?

00:25:17,968 --> 00:25:19,936
She left without telling us.

00:25:20,003 --> 00:25:21,938
Figures she'd die the same way.

00:25:22,005 --> 00:25:23,673
I don't think
your mom knew

00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,375
she was going to die, bud.

00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:27,577
Whatever.

00:25:27,644 --> 00:25:30,380
( <i>muffled music playing</i> )

00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:34,751
Last time I saw my mother,
I was... in seventh grade.

00:25:34,818 --> 00:25:38,054
She handed me my lunch and
said, "See you after school."

00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,923
Did you know that she was back?

00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,759
I thought that she was dead.

00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,296
Can I sit down?

00:25:46,363 --> 00:25:48,164
Yeah, sure.

00:25:48,231 --> 00:25:50,400
Nora, I'm sorry.

00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:53,136
I know this has got to be

00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:55,939
very hard
on you and your brother.

00:25:56,006 --> 00:25:58,375
And my dad.

00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:06,750
Is your dad seeing anybody?

00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:09,719
Does he have
a girlfriend?

00:26:09,786 --> 00:26:11,788
How could he?

00:27:45,115 --> 00:27:47,717
STOKES:
This is where I found the hairs,

00:27:47,784 --> 00:27:50,921
in between the packages
of frozen peas.

00:27:52,622 --> 00:27:54,925
Mrs. Easton was
a brunette.

00:27:54,991 --> 00:27:58,361
And we found a warehouse worth
of frozen peas at the landfill.

00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,766
Lack of swelling,
clean fractures...

00:28:06,469 --> 00:28:07,771
She was frozen.

00:28:12,676 --> 00:28:14,477
Skin and muscle
would've lost elasticity.

00:28:14,544 --> 00:28:17,247
Fracture planes would've passed
through in a straight line.

00:28:17,314 --> 00:28:18,915
I'm thinking somebody
in this family

00:28:18,982 --> 00:28:21,918
stuck her in here,
waited 'til trash day.

00:28:26,823 --> 00:28:29,759
Well, the garbage tells us
how she was killed.

00:28:29,826 --> 00:28:31,828
Now I want to know who.

00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:39,102
That unknown substance

00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:41,204
I collected from
Marty Gibson's coat...

00:28:41,271 --> 00:28:43,139
Possibly reptilian skin?

00:28:43,206 --> 00:28:44,574
How'd you know?

00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:45,976
Tox report.

00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:49,112
The organic poison
came back snake venom.

00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:51,348
I think maybe it's time

00:28:51,414 --> 00:28:55,252
to open a relationship
with Marty Gibson.

00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:58,154
We found reptile skin
on your jacket sleeve.

00:28:58,221 --> 00:28:59,923
So, unless
you're shedding,

00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,092
we want to know
how it got there.

00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:03,660
Whoa, gentlemen,
slow down.

00:29:03,727 --> 00:29:05,428
Can I get you
a cup of coffee?

00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:06,630
Nanci...?
No, thank you.

00:29:06,696 --> 00:29:08,898
Doughnut? Everybody
loves doughnuts. Nanci.

00:29:08,965 --> 00:29:10,133
No doughnuts.

00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,801
Fred Stearns
dropped a dime

00:29:11,868 --> 00:29:13,570
at Girls, Girls, Girls
and wrote it off.

00:29:13,637 --> 00:29:14,571
Kaido Computers.

00:29:14,638 --> 00:29:16,273
Software guys are nuts,
into the kinky stuff.

00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:17,807
End of the day,

00:29:17,874 --> 00:29:19,075
they're driving Fred's cars.

00:29:19,142 --> 00:29:20,377
Neiman Marcus,

00:29:20,443 --> 00:29:21,478
jewelry
department?

00:29:21,544 --> 00:29:23,980
Fred knew you got
to spend money to make money.

00:29:24,047 --> 00:29:25,282
Well, here's
a freaky one.

00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:27,817
Since when are two dozen mice
a business expense?

00:29:27,884 --> 00:29:30,120
Since I got The Pet Place
to buy a mini-van from me.

00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:31,154
My cousin works there.

00:29:31,221 --> 00:29:32,155
You got kids?

00:29:32,222 --> 00:29:33,490
I could put you
in a wagon

00:29:33,556 --> 00:29:35,625
way below sticker.

00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:39,095
Marty, what'd you do
with the mice?

00:29:39,162 --> 00:29:41,164
What do you care?

00:29:41,231 --> 00:29:44,734
You going to arrest me
for blurring the lines?

00:29:44,801 --> 00:29:45,835
No.

00:29:45,902 --> 00:29:47,837
We were leaning towards murder.

00:29:52,609 --> 00:29:55,211
You guys are
completely overreacting.

00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:57,614
It's just a hobby.

00:29:57,681 --> 00:29:59,416
See?

00:29:59,482 --> 00:30:01,518
Fuzzies. They're food.

00:30:01,585 --> 00:30:03,720
You know it's illegal
in the State of Nevada

00:30:03,787 --> 00:30:04,955
to have venomous snakes?

00:30:05,021 --> 00:30:07,090
If you handle them correctly,
snakes are harmless.

00:30:07,157 --> 00:30:08,091
I know what I'm doing.

00:30:08,158 --> 00:30:10,594
Yeah, that's what
we're afraid of.

00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:13,663
DANIEL:
<i>I didn't even know</i>
<i>she was dead.</i>

00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,365
Thought she'd
just left me again.

00:30:15,432 --> 00:30:16,666
BRASS:
Well, it's a good thing

00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:18,335
you didn't tell the
kids mom was back.

00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:20,070
My client agreed
to talk to you,

00:30:20,136 --> 00:30:21,404
not be harassed by you.

00:30:21,471 --> 00:30:22,706
You're right.

00:30:22,772 --> 00:30:24,174
Well, you were excited
to see her.

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,308
Why wouldn't the kids be?

00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:26,843
I'm an adult.

00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,645
That's right,
you're an adult--

00:30:28,712 --> 00:30:30,914
knowledgeable,
experienced...

00:30:30,981 --> 00:30:33,917
aware of Nevada Statutes,
Chapter 156:

00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,786
Administration of Estates
of Missing Persons.

00:30:36,853 --> 00:30:37,988
It's a matter of public record.

00:30:38,054 --> 00:30:38,989
We've been filling out

00:30:39,055 --> 00:30:40,323
those forms
for five years.

00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,324
You're jumping the gun.

00:30:41,391 --> 00:30:43,627
It's four years,
11 months, one week.

00:30:43,693 --> 00:30:45,061
So what?

00:30:45,128 --> 00:30:46,062
Well, in three weeks,

00:30:46,129 --> 00:30:47,497
Mrs. Easton's estate
can be distributed

00:30:47,564 --> 00:30:48,498
to her husband.

00:30:48,565 --> 00:30:49,799
You had a half
a million dollar

00:30:49,866 --> 00:30:51,334
life insurance policy
on your wife.

00:30:51,401 --> 00:30:52,535
And she had one on me.

00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:53,970
We did that for the kids.

00:30:54,037 --> 00:30:55,505
But you're not dead,

00:30:55,572 --> 00:30:57,407
and she wasn't either,
two days ago.

00:30:57,474 --> 00:30:59,609
You know, for
an unemployed guy

00:30:59,676 --> 00:31:01,544
you're doing a lot of spending.

00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:03,179
I mean, Tiffany's,
La Perla

00:31:03,246 --> 00:31:05,048
International
Watch Company...

00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:07,884
Expecting a windfall?

00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:08,952
Don't answer that.

00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:11,421
You're fishing.

00:31:11,488 --> 00:31:12,789
No, I do that with a pole.

00:31:12,856 --> 00:31:14,457
No, I'm just thinking out loud.

00:31:14,524 --> 00:31:15,592
Your wife disappears.

00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:17,594
Five years
after the fact,

00:31:17,661 --> 00:31:19,029
you get the money.

00:31:19,095 --> 00:31:21,431
You've earned it, it's yours,
but she screwed you up.

00:31:21,498 --> 00:31:23,199
She showed up.

00:31:25,268 --> 00:31:28,638
I did not kill my wife.

00:31:28,705 --> 00:31:29,973
What happened, Daniel?

00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,309
The sex wasn't as good
as you remembered it,

00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:33,977
or the money was better?

00:31:34,044 --> 00:31:35,478
What happened?

00:31:39,716 --> 00:31:43,620
Scales found on your
suspect's jacket are keeled.

00:31:43,687 --> 00:31:46,590
Diamondback Rattlesnake.

00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:49,125
His others,
smooth scales.

00:31:49,192 --> 00:31:52,395
A snake fang is basically

00:31:52,462 --> 00:31:54,230
a hypodermic
needle.

00:31:54,297 --> 00:31:56,132
Oral glands hold in the venom...

00:31:57,567 --> 00:31:58,635
like the barrel.

00:31:58,702 --> 00:31:59,769
When aggravated,

00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:02,472
the jaw muscles

00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:05,075
push on the toxin,
like a plunger.

00:32:05,141 --> 00:32:07,344
Only, our victim
didn't have

00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:08,812
any puncture wounds.

00:32:11,481 --> 00:32:13,183
Well, your guy's
probably

00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,986
pretty comfortable
with his collection--

00:32:16,052 --> 00:32:17,587
otherwise, he'd be dead--

00:32:17,654 --> 00:32:18,588
which means,

00:32:18,655 --> 00:32:20,290
he could've milked this one.

00:32:20,357 --> 00:32:22,225
And brought the venom
with him to the dealership.

00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,896
Well, the trace lab
found venom proteins
in his coffee cup.

00:32:26,963 --> 00:32:28,465
Could that have killed him?

00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:31,768
Well, I know a lot of hot shots
who drink the stuff--

00:32:31,835 --> 00:32:33,336
manly,
daredevil B.S.--

00:32:33,403 --> 00:32:34,804
and they're still alive.

00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:36,006
Because
typically,

00:32:36,072 --> 00:32:37,474
the stomach acids

00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,541
would kill the venom

00:32:38,608 --> 00:32:40,310
before it reached
the bloodstream,

00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:41,611
but if you had an ulcer...

00:32:41,678 --> 00:32:44,581
Hmm, then you're
seriously screwed.

00:32:44,648 --> 00:32:47,984
Was there an abnormal
tissue death? Necrosis?

00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:49,052
No.

00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,954
That rules out his
Diamondback Rattlesnake.

00:32:51,021 --> 00:32:53,056
Rattler venom's hemotoxic.

00:32:53,123 --> 00:32:54,157
It means

00:32:54,224 --> 00:32:57,360
it predigests the tissue
before swallowing.

00:32:58,695 --> 00:33:02,232
Well, the ELISA test came back
positive for alpha-neurotoxins.

00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:06,002
Well, your guy likes them mean.

00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:08,805
These other two
could've done the job,

00:33:08,872 --> 00:33:09,873
both neurotoxic.

00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,941
Which would send the body

00:33:11,007 --> 00:33:12,676
into complete
and total paralysis, right?

00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:14,644
Explaining why

00:33:14,711 --> 00:33:17,147
the victim ended up
in the morgue the first time.

00:33:17,213 --> 00:33:19,215
Okay, blood
from the bedroom chair

00:33:19,282 --> 00:33:21,084
and the kitchen
belong to Mom.

00:33:21,151 --> 00:33:22,385
That's what I figured.

00:33:22,452 --> 00:33:24,854
Hair from the freezer--
nicely preserved, by the way--

00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:26,489
and hairs
from the bedroom pillow,

00:33:26,556 --> 00:33:27,824
also the victim's.

00:33:27,891 --> 00:33:30,360
Okay, this is all great,

00:33:30,427 --> 00:33:33,330
but, uh, why the 9-1-1 page?

00:33:33,396 --> 00:33:34,864
The moral of my story--

00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:36,666
share and share alleles.

00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:38,868
Pubic hairs
in the bed,

00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:40,136
not Mom's.

00:33:41,972 --> 00:33:45,041
The daughter.

00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:48,812
Dad did have a new girlfriend.

00:33:51,214 --> 00:33:53,250
The bracelet was a gift.

00:33:53,316 --> 00:33:56,086
From your father.

00:33:56,152 --> 00:34:01,157
Diamonds and platinum,
that's, uh, pretty fancy.

00:34:01,224 --> 00:34:03,727
Guess he thought
I deserved it.

00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:06,429
Why?

00:34:06,496 --> 00:34:09,065
For taking care of everything.

00:34:11,434 --> 00:34:12,602
Everything?

00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:19,242
Laundry, groceries,
carpool for Charlie...

00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:21,444
Is that it?

00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:28,952
Nora...

00:34:29,019 --> 00:34:32,756
I'd really like to help
you and your brother,

00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:35,425
but I can't
unless you talk to me.

00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:45,435
We found evidence of you
in your father's bed.

00:34:51,074 --> 00:34:53,543
My father loves me.

00:35:01,918 --> 00:35:04,854
Oh, my God.

00:35:07,757 --> 00:35:09,659
Are you lactating?

00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:14,064
You're pregnant.

00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,309
You sick son of a bitch.

00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:29,879
Did you think we weren't going
to find out she was pregnant?

00:35:29,946 --> 00:35:31,047
Who?

00:35:31,114 --> 00:35:32,816
Oh, stop it. Your daughter.

00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:34,618
Nora is pregnant?

00:35:34,684 --> 00:35:36,219
Cut the clueless routine.

00:35:36,286 --> 00:35:37,854
What are you accusing me of?

00:35:40,857 --> 00:35:41,891
Daniel!

00:35:43,994 --> 00:35:46,896
Your wife came back
and saw what you were doing.

00:35:46,963 --> 00:35:50,567
So, you killed her, and you
tried to buy off your daughter

00:35:50,634 --> 00:35:51,901
with a diamond
bracelet.

00:35:51,968 --> 00:35:53,870
I bought that for my wife.

00:35:53,937 --> 00:35:55,472
Your daughter's telling
a different story.

00:35:55,538 --> 00:35:57,874
Nora? How could
she even know about...

00:35:57,941 --> 00:35:59,676
I'm going
to nail you for murder.

00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:05,493
What do you
mean, "None"?

00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,595
Well, venom's
like perfume--

00:36:07,662 --> 00:36:09,063
highly specific
recipe.

00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,366
Protein ratios vary
from species to species,

00:36:11,432 --> 00:36:12,467
even snake to snake.

00:36:12,534 --> 00:36:15,069
The protein level
of your three "hoses"

00:36:15,136 --> 00:36:17,572
doesn't match the sample
taken from the vic's coffee cup.

00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:19,340
So, Marty was
telling the truth?

00:36:19,407 --> 00:36:21,075
It was just
a coincidence
that he owns

00:36:21,142 --> 00:36:23,811
poisonous snakes,
and his co-worker
was envenomated.

00:36:23,878 --> 00:36:24,979
A coincidence

00:36:25,046 --> 00:36:26,948
is a scientific
anomaly.

00:36:27,015 --> 00:36:29,384
Maybe he just
got rid of the snake.

00:36:36,157 --> 00:36:38,193
Girl called all hysterical.

00:36:38,259 --> 00:36:40,161
Said a snake ate her dog.

00:36:40,228 --> 00:36:42,530
It's a monacled cobra--
it's not indigenous.

00:36:42,597 --> 00:36:43,965
Comes from southeast Asia.

00:36:44,032 --> 00:36:45,800
I asked her
where she got it from.

00:36:45,867 --> 00:36:48,336
She said her co-worker
asked her to snake-sit.

00:36:48,403 --> 00:36:50,338
Marty Gibson.

00:36:50,405 --> 00:36:52,106
Mm-hmm.

00:36:55,777 --> 00:36:58,947
You're that guy
from the crime lab.

00:36:59,013 --> 00:37:00,615
Well, you're a little late.

00:37:00,682 --> 00:37:04,352
Bastard told me he had a
sure-fire way to win the Cabo
trip,

00:37:04,419 --> 00:37:06,254
and that he'd take me with him

00:37:06,321 --> 00:37:10,391
if I just watched his snake
for a couple of days.

00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:14,229
I can't believe
what an idiot I am.

00:37:14,295 --> 00:37:17,332
Never trust a car salesman.

00:37:17,398 --> 00:37:19,767
What else did you do
for Marty?

00:37:23,605 --> 00:37:25,406
Well, not <i>that.</i>

00:37:25,473 --> 00:37:27,475
Did you get him coffee?

00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:30,378
Oh, well, now I do.

00:37:30,445 --> 00:37:31,746
<i>Now</i> you do?

00:37:31,813 --> 00:37:34,148
Yeah. It used to be Marty,

00:37:34,215 --> 00:37:37,051
the goodwill guy
who got coffee
for everybody else,

00:37:37,118 --> 00:37:40,054
but now, since Fred's dead,
he's moved up a desk.

00:37:40,121 --> 00:37:41,556
"The goodwill guy?"

00:37:41,623 --> 00:37:42,824
Yeah.

00:37:42,891 --> 00:37:44,859
The guy
with no client list of his own,

00:37:44,926 --> 00:37:47,395
has to live off
the hand-me-downs of the others.

00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:50,365
FRED:
Hey, Marty, uh, sure could use
another refill.

00:37:50,431 --> 00:37:51,699
You want anything?

00:37:51,766 --> 00:37:52,667
Easy on the sugar.

00:37:52,734 --> 00:37:53,968
Coming right up.

00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:58,606
Well, sometimes access
is all you need.

00:38:07,782 --> 00:38:09,551
Nanci.

00:38:09,617 --> 00:38:11,920
Do you know what a syllogism is,
Mr. Gibson?

00:38:11,986 --> 00:38:13,121
Sylla-what?

00:38:13,187 --> 00:38:14,289
A syllogism.

00:38:14,355 --> 00:38:15,356
Aristotelian logic.

00:38:15,423 --> 00:38:17,192
Two premises
equal one conclusion.

00:38:17,258 --> 00:38:18,583
BOTH:
"A" plus "B" equals "C."

00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:19,166
Right.

00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:20,300
So, you're the snake guy.

00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:22,235
You're also the goodwill guy
who gets the coffee.

00:38:22,302 --> 00:38:23,370
So, when someone is poisoned

00:38:23,437 --> 00:38:24,671
with snake venom
in their coffee,

00:38:25,708 --> 00:38:26,909
"A" plus "B" equals you.

00:38:26,976 --> 00:38:28,611
I busted my ass
out on this floor

00:38:28,678 --> 00:38:30,513
to get a desk up
there, and for what?

00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:31,500
So Fred can make
me his bitch?

00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,434
So you kill him?

00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:33,535
Fred killed himself.

00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,603
Guy was like a goldfish.

00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,204
He would have eaten
himself to death

00:38:36,271 --> 00:38:37,472
before he tossed
me a client.

00:38:37,539 --> 00:38:39,408
And one good client
breeds seven more.

00:38:39,474 --> 00:38:41,076
Without the one,
I keep slipping.

00:38:41,143 --> 00:38:43,812
There's two directions in
this business-- up and out.

00:38:43,879 --> 00:38:44,913
It's a numbers game.

00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,048
I'm 35 years old.

00:38:46,114 --> 00:38:47,749
I got six guys
ready to move me out.

00:38:47,816 --> 00:38:49,551
Opportunity knocks,
you open the door.

00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,620
I guess it's just too bad
he had an ulcer.

00:38:54,156 --> 00:38:55,857
Who doesn't?

00:38:59,961 --> 00:39:03,465
Okay, if I can
just have you lay back.

00:39:03,532 --> 00:39:06,868
All right, Nora, I'm going
to need you to relax.

00:39:09,237 --> 00:39:12,207
Okay, now take
a deep breath.

00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,845
Good.

00:39:16,912 --> 00:39:20,148
All right,
another deep breath.

00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,454
( <i>no audio</i> )

00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:29,758
She's a virgin?

00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,259
What are we
talking about,

00:39:31,326 --> 00:39:32,728
an immaculate
conception?

00:39:32,794 --> 00:39:35,831
More like
the immaculate <i>perception.</i>

00:39:35,897 --> 00:39:38,800
Pseudocyesis--
imagined pregnancy.

00:39:38,867 --> 00:39:41,670
It's all in her head?

00:39:41,737 --> 00:39:47,009
Well, that would explain what
she was doing in Dad's bed.

00:39:47,075 --> 00:39:49,678
Fantasizing.

00:39:49,745 --> 00:39:51,446
Wow.

00:39:51,513 --> 00:39:55,117
"When the desire
to become pregnant is so strong

00:39:55,183 --> 00:39:56,385
"hormone levels
can change,

00:39:56,451 --> 00:39:59,154
setting off all the biological
signs of pregnancy."

00:39:59,221 --> 00:40:00,288
It kind of makes sense.

00:40:00,355 --> 00:40:01,890
Hormones travel
the same channels

00:40:01,957 --> 00:40:03,525
as adrenaline.

00:40:03,592 --> 00:40:05,560
"Swollen abdomen,

00:40:05,627 --> 00:40:07,362
"lack of menstruation,

00:40:07,429 --> 00:40:10,465
and sometimes
bilateral galactorrhea."

00:40:10,532 --> 00:40:13,201
Milk production in both breasts.

00:40:13,268 --> 00:40:16,271
Leaking can be brought on
by stress.

00:40:17,606 --> 00:40:19,207
"Emotional or physical stimuli

00:40:19,274 --> 00:40:22,244
"cause prolactin to shoot
through the endocrine system,

00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,945
"ending in the mammary glands,

00:40:24,012 --> 00:40:26,114
and triggering the cells
to lactate."

00:40:26,181 --> 00:40:28,050
The father was clueless.

00:40:28,116 --> 00:40:30,819
About all the women in his life.

00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,721
STOKES:
Hey, hey.

00:40:32,788 --> 00:40:34,890
Check out these photos.

00:40:34,956 --> 00:40:37,859
The two stains on the
inside of the shirt
we found at the dump

00:40:37,926 --> 00:40:38,960
tested positive for Nora,

00:40:39,027 --> 00:40:40,829
but the stains on the
outside, bloodstains,

00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:41,830
are definitely Mom's.

00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,899
WILLOWS:
The bracelet was Mom's.

00:40:43,965 --> 00:40:45,701
Greg checked the epithelials.

00:40:45,767 --> 00:40:49,237
Nora's in love with her father,
in an Electra kind of way.

00:40:52,274 --> 00:40:54,276
WILLOWS:
Nora, is this your shirt?

00:40:54,343 --> 00:40:56,445
Yes.

00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,614
Can you explain to me

00:40:59,681 --> 00:41:01,683
how your mother's blood
ended up on it?

00:41:05,287 --> 00:41:07,422
No idea
how it got there?

00:41:09,891 --> 00:41:11,693
No.

00:41:14,262 --> 00:41:16,798
WILLOWS:
Well, you told me
that this bracelet

00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:18,433
was a gift
from your father.

00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,069
He claims that he bought it
for your mother.

00:41:21,136 --> 00:41:22,838
Oh, no.

00:41:22,904 --> 00:41:25,073
It's mine.

00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,877
I think you feel the same way
about your father.

00:41:57,439 --> 00:41:59,875
Guess who's back?

00:42:12,654 --> 00:42:15,724
And then you put your mother
in the freezer

00:42:15,791 --> 00:42:17,759
and you waited until trash day.

00:42:20,195 --> 00:42:22,998
That's a horrible story.

00:42:23,065 --> 00:42:24,366
It's not a story.

00:42:24,433 --> 00:42:27,002
It's what the evidence tells us
really happened.

00:42:27,069 --> 00:42:31,807
What kind of a mother
would do that?

00:42:31,873 --> 00:42:33,408
I'm helpful.

00:42:33,475 --> 00:42:35,310
I do what needs to be done.

00:42:35,377 --> 00:42:37,245
I know. You take care of things.

00:42:37,312 --> 00:42:40,749
I never ask for anything!

00:42:40,816 --> 00:42:41,817
And all you wanted

00:42:41,883 --> 00:42:43,652
was the one thing
that you couldn't have.

00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:45,454
It's not my fault.

00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,888
I'm innocent.

00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:50,859
You were innocent, Nora.

00:42:50,926 --> 00:42:52,928
You're not anymore.

00:42:57,966 --> 00:42:58,934
What are you doing?

00:42:59,001 --> 00:43:00,369
BRASS:
You're under arrest

00:43:00,435 --> 00:43:02,304
for the murder
of Kelly Easton.

00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,473
No, but I'm going
to have a baby!

00:43:05,574 --> 00:43:07,809
( <i>sighing</i> )

00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,978
Well, she's going
to retain an attorney.

00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,381
He's going to advise her
to plead insanity.

00:43:12,447 --> 00:43:14,616
Good defense.

00:43:15,917 --> 00:43:17,019
Yeah.

00:43:18,667 --> 00:43:20,656
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:24,860
How it manifested? No.

00:43:24,926 --> 00:43:28,130
But the cause?

00:43:28,196 --> 00:43:31,224
People throw things away
every day.
