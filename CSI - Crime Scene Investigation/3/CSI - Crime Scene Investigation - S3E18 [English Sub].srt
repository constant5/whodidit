Oh, my God, Billie,

00:00:47,355 --> 00:00:48,589
are you okay?

00:00:48,656 --> 00:00:50,391
What did you hit?

00:00:54,195 --> 00:00:57,532
So, according to the girl,
one minute

00:00:57,598 --> 00:00:59,250
she's blasting through the mud
and having fun,

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,218
everything's great,

00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:01,792
the next thing
she knows,

00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:03,154
she's lying upside
down in the dirt,

00:01:03,221 --> 00:01:05,000
staring at
chemical waste.

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,134
She called Hazmat.

00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:07,503
Now, it's not toxic.

00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:09,271
They saw the barrel
was buckling,

00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:11,874
they thought it
might explode,
so they opened it.

00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,975
Ugh!

00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,109
Yeah, whoa-ho.

00:01:18,447 --> 00:01:20,682
a.k.a. mortuary wax.

00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:23,218
This is what you get
when fatty tissue decomposes

00:01:23,285 --> 00:01:25,521
in an alkaline
environment with
limited oxygen.

00:01:25,587 --> 00:01:26,989
All you need
is a little moisture

00:01:27,055 --> 00:01:28,166
and enough time.

00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:31,909
Anaerobic bacteria
digest body fats,

00:01:31,976 --> 00:01:34,846
converting them
into a waxy solid.

00:01:34,912 --> 00:01:37,315
Kind of like the way
they make vegetable shortening.

00:01:37,382 --> 00:01:39,350

another French fry.

How do you know
it's a he?

00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,959
Five, six weeks,

With all this wind and weather,

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,997

Gentlemen, saponification
occurs most frequently

00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,018
in infant burials.

00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:31,219
That's because
their bodies

00:02:31,286 --> 00:02:33,321
have more fat,
and their bacterial flora

00:02:33,388 --> 00:02:36,291
aren't fully developed.

Something for Catherine.

Let's get the
rest of this out.

00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:51,673
Historically,

00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:54,909
saponified corpses that maintain
their physical features

00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:58,580
were looked upon as, uh,
incorruptible, even saintly.

00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:01,316
So, when it happened
to children,

00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:02,984
it just reinforced that notion.

00:03:03,051 --> 00:03:04,519
Hand me that foot there,
would you?

00:03:04,586 --> 00:03:07,088
Okay.

You know,
interestingly enough,

00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:13,728
since formaldehyde is alkaline
and American caskets are sealed,

00:03:13,795 --> 00:03:16,364
there are more bodies
in this country

00:03:16,431 --> 00:03:17,665

00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:20,335

00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:21,436
We are, in fact,

BROWN:
Are you serious?

00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:33,982
David lost a body?

00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:35,517
It happens.

00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,519
When I was working
in Minneapolis,

00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:40,321
we had two John Smiths
come in on the same day.

00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:42,357
Sent the wrong one
back to Canada.

00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,692
Anyway, our body's
still in the morgue.

00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:47,328
David finally processed
his ten card.

00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:49,330
Guy's name is Keith Mercer.

00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:50,732
When did he come in?

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:51,800
11 days ago.

00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:52,867
Found him in an alley

00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:53,968
off of Fremont

00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:55,937
in a pile of garbage
next to the dumpster.

00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:57,939
11 days ago.

00:03:58,006 --> 00:04:01,109
I guess we got no more
crime scene to process, huh?

00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:04,312
Initially, the police
thought he was homeless.

00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,380
He hadn't bathed,

00:04:05,447 --> 00:04:07,882
no wallet,
watch or keys,

00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:10,051
and he has scars
on his lower legs.

00:04:10,118 --> 00:04:11,052
And a nice laceration

00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:13,888
with ecchymosis
on his left temple.

00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:15,490
Yeah, cause
of death was

00:04:15,557 --> 00:04:16,891
blunt force trauma to the head.

00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,326
Could have been
an accident.

00:04:18,393 --> 00:04:19,761
Could have been a lot of things.

00:04:21,863 --> 00:04:25,700
Evidence without context
is ambiguous at best.

00:04:31,172 --> 00:04:33,608
Did you ever chop wood,
split a log?

00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,708
I've seen it done.

00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,375
You should try
it sometime.

00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,110
I find it relaxing.

00:04:39,176 --> 00:04:41,078
Mmm.

00:04:41,145 --> 00:04:44,115
The blow here was
delivered in a
similar fashion.

00:04:44,181 --> 00:04:45,750
The temporal
bone was hit,

00:04:45,816 --> 00:04:47,084
driven down hard.

00:04:47,151 --> 00:04:48,753
Upper palate smashed.

00:04:50,688 --> 00:04:52,490
What about the foot?

00:04:52,556 --> 00:04:54,625
It looks as though
that's been sheared off.

00:04:54,692 --> 00:04:56,460
Yeah, by something
fast and powerful.

00:04:56,527 --> 00:04:57,662
Industrial accident?

00:04:57,728 --> 00:05:00,064
No, industrial accidents
are messy.

00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:01,866
These cuts
are too clean.

00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:02,750
My guess--

00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,852
single impact.

00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:04,953
How about an axe then?

00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:08,123
Possible.

Well, if the head
and hands were missing,

I'd be saying
mob hit.

00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:16,587
Could be ritual
mutilation or
fetish murder.

00:05:16,654 --> 00:05:20,000
So, ID from dental records
is out.

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,702
How about DNA?

00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:24,271
Bone marrow
may still be viable.

00:05:24,338 --> 00:05:25,806
My thoughts exactly.

00:05:25,873 --> 00:05:28,108

is a large bone

00:05:29,343 --> 00:05:31,645

00:10:15,102 --> 00:10:16,570
If people bet,
that's their business.

00:10:16,637 --> 00:10:18,873
You're the only house in Vegas
that doesn't take a cut.

00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:20,667
Hey, my daddy ran
an independent
shipping company.

00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:21,968
He ran it right
into the ground.

00:10:22,035 --> 00:10:23,236
He died broke,
but he left me

00:10:23,302 --> 00:10:24,604
a bunch of empty warehouses.

00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:25,938
I needed revenue,

00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:27,273
so I developed a new market.

00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,808
Hey, Jimbo, you looked
ferocious out there.

00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,009
Thanks, Ginger.

00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:31,210
We lost.

00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:33,279
Yeah, but I like a guy
who goes down with style.

00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,152
Look available, be unobtainable.

00:10:39,218 --> 00:10:40,653
Keeps them coming back for more.

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,255
Want to tell me

00:10:42,322 --> 00:10:43,456
what this is all about?

00:10:46,326 --> 00:10:47,727
That's Chris Cutler.

00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:48,661
He's dead.

00:10:48,728 --> 00:10:51,331
WILLOWS:
He found his body

00:10:51,397 --> 00:10:53,433
stuffed in a chemical waste
drum from this warehouse.

00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:56,202
When was the last time
you saw Christian?

00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:58,834
God, about six weeks ago.

00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:00,469
Robot Rumble, big free-for-all.

00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:13,682
He had the kind of night

00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:15,284
that most of these boys
dream about.

00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,686
<i>Using the thing that he built</i>

00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:19,788
<i>to destroy the thing</i>
<i>that the other guy built.</i>

00:11:19,855 --> 00:11:21,490
It's a basic male drive.

00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:22,624
That kind of puts that whole

00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:23,926
weapons of mass
destruction thing

00:11:23,992 --> 00:11:25,794
into perspective.

00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:29,665
I take it this Chris
was not well liked.

00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,633
Let me put it to you this way--

00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,402
nobody likes
a winner who needs

00:11:33,468 --> 00:11:34,870
to shove it
in your face.

00:11:34,937 --> 00:11:36,138
We're going to need you

00:11:36,205 --> 00:11:37,973
to identify the guys
he fought with that night.

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,274
As well as their bots.

00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:41,276
We can't have a murder
without a murder weapon.

00:11:41,343 --> 00:11:42,978
We'll take them all.

00:11:46,181 --> 00:11:50,152
WOMAN:
Keith went to Yosemite
to climb El Capitan.

00:11:50,219 --> 00:11:52,488
The Shield Headwall.

00:11:52,554 --> 00:11:54,122
Did you go with him?

00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:56,325
I drove to Taos
to see my sister.

00:11:56,391 --> 00:11:57,526
And got back when?

00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:58,894
Ten days ago.

00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:01,296
Keith's gear was in the living
room, but he wasn't there.

00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:02,331
What did you do then?

00:12:02,397 --> 00:12:03,832
I called his cell phone.

00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:06,335
I called his office.

00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:08,737
And then I called the Park
Service and all they said

00:12:08,804 --> 00:12:11,006
was that Keith had been by
to pick up his permit.

00:12:11,073 --> 00:12:14,243
So then I checked the hospitals
up there and nothing.

00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:17,513
Then I called
the hospitals in Vegas.

00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,248
And then I called the police.

00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:25,087
I did everything I could do
and nobody would pay attention.

00:12:25,154 --> 00:12:27,623
Mrs. Mercer...

00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:30,392
you have my attention.

00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,428
And I'd like to see your house.

00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:40,202
Looks like his gear's all here.

00:12:41,503 --> 00:12:43,906
I don't see a sleeping
bag, though.

00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,174
GRISSOM:
It looks like someone

00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,542
was trying to clean up, too,

00:12:46,608 --> 00:12:47,910
but forgot to use

00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,244
their Murphy's Oil Soap.

00:12:51,713 --> 00:12:53,048
Luminol.

00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,228
You called it.

00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,397
Positive for blood.

00:13:27,282 --> 00:13:29,384
Got a trail
of bloody footprints.

00:13:29,451 --> 00:13:30,853
I got blood here, too.

00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,231
Grissom.

00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,669
I think I might have
just found our murder weapon.

00:14:22,337 --> 00:14:23,972
SIDLE:
Spiker Chick,

00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:25,374
Donsueme,

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,810
Slaughter 10?

00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:30,579
You really think
one of these things
killed your vic?

00:14:30,646 --> 00:14:32,281
They're fast,
they're powerful,

00:14:32,347 --> 00:14:34,249
and the weapon
characteristics fit,

00:14:34,316 --> 00:14:35,684
so I can't rule them out.

00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:37,152
Well, you know what they say--

00:14:37,219 --> 00:14:39,021
it's what's on the inside
that counts.

00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,255
( <i>drill whirs</i> )

00:14:40,322 --> 00:14:41,723
Well put.

00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,094
I got blood.

00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:20,729
Yeah, join the club.

00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:22,631
I'll take these to Greg.

00:15:22,698 --> 00:15:25,300
I'll get going
on the tool marks.

00:15:36,111 --> 00:15:38,113
( <i>saw whirs</i> )

00:16:37,306 --> 00:16:39,007
Any luck?

00:16:39,074 --> 00:16:40,075
No.

00:16:40,142 --> 00:16:41,977
Tool marks don't match
the vic's wounds.

00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:43,345
Mm.

00:16:43,412 --> 00:16:45,414
Could have saved you the time.

00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:48,250
DNA beats tool marks
every time, you know.

00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:50,018
I ran your blood samples.

00:16:50,085 --> 00:16:52,354
Got a match,
all three of them.

00:16:52,421 --> 00:16:54,490
Victim's blood,

00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:57,993
three different parts
from three different bots?

00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,461
That doesn't
make any sense.

00:16:59,528 --> 00:17:02,130
Well, where did
the parts come from?

00:17:06,835 --> 00:17:09,371
MAN:
I buy and sell and trade
parts all the time.

00:17:09,438 --> 00:17:10,706
From all over the place.

00:17:10,772 --> 00:17:12,307
Salvage yards, swap meets, eBay.

00:17:12,374 --> 00:17:13,509
They usually have blood on them?

00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:14,510
I don't check.

00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:16,044
Doesn't matter
if they're clean or dirty,

00:17:16,111 --> 00:17:17,045
only that they work.

00:17:17,112 --> 00:17:19,014
Look, me and Chris
are partners.

00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,816
I built the bot,
he drove it.

00:17:20,883 --> 00:17:22,618
We kicked ass,
made good cash.

00:17:22,684 --> 00:17:24,319
Why would I
want him dead?

00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,223
You know, Brian,

00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,892
I mean...

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,527
your best buddy
drops off

00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:32,494
the face of the earth

00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:34,263
for six weeks...

00:17:36,532 --> 00:17:37,833
You get a call
or e-mail

00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,701
or postcard? No.

00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:42,304
But you care
so much about him

00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:44,840
that you do absolutely nothing
to find out what happened.

00:17:44,907 --> 00:17:47,810
You can understand why we're
here, so straighten us out.

00:17:47,876 --> 00:17:50,712
There was nothing weird about
Chris being gone like that.

00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:52,714
He did stage effects
for Pyrotechnica.

00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:54,249
Have some pretty good tunes.

00:17:54,316 --> 00:17:56,418
Worth listening to.

00:17:56,485 --> 00:17:57,886
Or not. Anyway...

00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:58,921
when Chris
is on the road

00:17:58,987 --> 00:18:00,889
he's a vapor trail.

00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:02,758
He's not a phone call
kind of guy.

00:18:02,825 --> 00:18:03,992
That's a nice ATV.

00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:06,261
You ever take it
to the mountains?

00:18:06,328 --> 00:18:07,429
Yeah, sometimes.

00:18:07,496 --> 00:18:09,665
I, uh, I dabble
in ambient music.

00:18:09,731 --> 00:18:11,133
She wants her father.

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,035
There's some
pretty good samples

00:18:13,101 --> 00:18:15,704
out in the mountains,
especially at night.

00:18:15,771 --> 00:18:19,274
( <i>baby crying</i> )

00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,712
You know, you got a lot
of hobbies, Brian.

00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:26,348
Oh, you don't have hobbies
you go nuts.

00:18:26,415 --> 00:18:28,183
Human beings are designed
to make things.

00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,186
It's hard-wired
into our brains.

00:18:31,253 --> 00:18:33,388
We make things, we build things
to make more things.

00:18:33,455 --> 00:18:35,424
It's what sets us apart
from the other animals.

00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:37,559
Except monkeys.
Primates in general, I guess.

00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:38,594
STOKES:
Brian, Brian.

00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,595
Yeah?

00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:40,863
Hobbies take up space.

00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:43,599
You don't seem to have
a whole lot of that here.

00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:44,967
Do you have a workshop?

00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:47,069
Uh, I rent a space.

00:18:47,135 --> 00:18:49,538
( <i>saw whirring</i> )

00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,860
MAN:
All right, Poindexter,
we got to clear the room.

00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:57,861
Come on, let's go.

00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,697
Hey, you, down there,
let's go.

00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,432
Come on, we're
clearing out.

00:19:01,498 --> 00:19:02,433
Let's go.

00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:04,735
Put the screwdriver down.
Let's go.

00:19:04,802 --> 00:19:06,971
Okay.

00:19:07,037 --> 00:19:10,040
Slow day oppressing the weak?

00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,076
Don't scuff your jackboots.

00:19:12,142 --> 00:19:14,511
Let's go.
Let's go.

00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:24,500
Is this
a machine shop

00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,035
or a junkyard?

00:19:27,803 --> 00:19:30,806
I guess what passes
for pinups with these guys.

00:19:38,781 --> 00:19:40,716
This is Brian's bot right here.

00:19:40,783 --> 00:19:42,217
Smash-n-Burn.

00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:45,921
And it's got
a spinning weapon.

00:19:45,988 --> 00:19:48,624
We should take it in
for tool marks.

00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:51,760
And it's missing parts,too.

00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,706
So this must be Hammer of God.

00:20:03,772 --> 00:20:06,775
Or at least what's left of it.

00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,579
WOMAN ANNOUNCER:
Hammer of God
is against the ropes.

00:20:12,214 --> 00:20:14,216
Rust stain.

00:20:26,261 --> 00:20:28,163
23 inches.

00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,432
That's standard diameter

00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:32,735
for a 55-gallon drum.

00:20:52,855 --> 00:20:55,391
Catherine, I've got spatter.

00:20:55,457 --> 00:20:57,726
( <i>saw whirring</i>
<i>and man screaming</i> )

our murder scene.

I think we just got Ginger.

00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,935
We traced the machine shop back
through a holding corporation.

00:21:11,002 --> 00:21:12,137
To me.

00:21:12,203 --> 00:21:13,304
I own it.

00:21:13,371 --> 00:21:14,539
It's a rental
property.

00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,707
It's a good one.

00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,108
It's popular
with the bot boys.

00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:19,277
I would have told you
if you'd bothered to ask.

00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,445
Well, we found this

00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,147
in Brian's station--
your fingernail.

00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,317
They break.

00:21:26,384 --> 00:21:27,419
Yeah, they also scratch.

00:21:27,485 --> 00:21:29,988
There were skin scrapings
under the nail.

00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,723
We tested the epithelials.

00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,591
They're Christian Cutler's.

00:21:33,658 --> 00:21:36,127
Your shop,

00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,495
your fingernail,

00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,664
your waste drum
with the dead guy in it.

00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,466
I stop by every
now and then

00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,702
to make sure my
clients are happy.

00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:46,371
Chris was there alone
one night working.

00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,339
He kind of got
the wrong idea.

00:21:48,406 --> 00:21:50,308
Come on.
He just wants to play.

00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,610
No, Chris, stop doing it.
It's not funny.

00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:53,917
Way you keep shoving
those ta-tas in my face

00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,018
isn't funny, either.

00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:01,177
And you didn't think
this was... worth mentioning?

00:22:01,244 --> 00:22:02,512
Hey, you guys
asked me

00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:03,713
when I saw him last.

00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,217
This happened the day before
the big free-for-all.

00:22:07,283 --> 00:22:09,819
So, that's the price
of doing business?

00:22:09,886 --> 00:22:11,087
Yeah, you could call it that.

00:22:11,154 --> 00:22:12,088
Here's the way

00:22:12,155 --> 00:22:13,189
<i>I'd</i> call it...

00:22:13,256 --> 00:22:16,025
Give me that,
you son of a bitch.

00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,562
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:22,165
Listen, I let the geeks
fantasize about me.

00:22:22,232 --> 00:22:24,033
And most of them are harmless,

00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,203
happy to stare and then go home
and spank the monkey

00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,105
like good little college boys.

00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:33,076
But Chris was
a dumb, vicious
Army grunt.

00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,044
And maybe I wasn't
as careful around him

00:22:35,111 --> 00:22:36,146
as I should have been,

00:22:36,212 --> 00:22:38,148
but that doesn't mean
that I killed him.

00:23:44,414 --> 00:23:46,616
Mrs. Mercer,
we found this statue

00:23:46,683 --> 00:23:48,418
on your mantle.

00:23:48,485 --> 00:23:50,253
It had your
fingerprints on it.

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,654
It was a wedding gift.

00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,357
Well, we also found
your husband's blood

00:23:54,424 --> 00:23:55,692
on the base of it.

00:23:58,795 --> 00:24:00,497
Did you touch
or move this statue

00:24:00,563 --> 00:24:02,298
at any time
in the last ten days?

00:24:02,365 --> 00:24:03,700
Keith hated that thing.

00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:05,635
He was always trying
to toss it.

00:24:05,702 --> 00:24:08,838
<i>When I came home,</i>
<i>I found it on the floor.</i>

00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,141
I thought
he'd put it there.

00:24:11,207 --> 00:24:14,277
I found it in the hall closet,
in the garage.

00:24:14,344 --> 00:24:16,312
I even found it in the car once.

00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:18,348
It was like a game
for us.

00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:23,052
Look, I came to you.

00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:25,321
You guys have been
giving me the runaround

00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:26,523
for over a week.

00:24:26,589 --> 00:24:27,724
GRISSOM:
Could you tell us

00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:31,928
what you kept in this box?

00:24:35,865 --> 00:24:38,668
We inherited a coin collection,
and we figured...

00:24:39,803 --> 00:24:42,071
we'd save it
for a rainy day.

00:24:44,874 --> 00:24:46,443
( <i>beeps</i> )

00:24:49,612 --> 00:24:51,815
WILLOWS:
No "Cutler-comma-Christian."

00:24:51,881 --> 00:24:53,817
Ring's not his.

00:24:53,883 --> 00:24:55,819
Never went to college.

00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:57,787
That part wasn't in
his service record.

00:24:57,854 --> 00:24:58,922
Scroll up.

00:24:58,988 --> 00:25:00,123
Check the K's.

00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,284
Hmm.

00:25:05,351 --> 00:25:07,720
Hold it.

00:25:07,787 --> 00:25:09,388
Bingo.

00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:15,194
The rings belongs to you, Brian.

00:25:15,261 --> 00:25:16,262
You must have dropped it

00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:18,431
when you stuffing your buddy's
corpse into a barrel.

00:25:18,498 --> 00:25:21,801
( <i>panting</i> )

00:25:21,868 --> 00:25:23,836
BRASS:
Here's the way
this is going to play out.

00:25:23,903 --> 00:25:25,204
This is the
best-case scenario.

00:25:25,271 --> 00:25:26,305
We arrest you
for murder.

00:25:26,372 --> 00:25:28,574
The, uh, the jury
likes your face,

00:25:28,641 --> 00:25:30,243
and, uh, you get Man One.

00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:32,912
Then you get to spend
the next 15 years

00:25:32,979 --> 00:25:37,083
staring at your wife and kid
through a wire glass window.

00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,185
Maybe if you're
lucky, uh...

00:25:39,252 --> 00:25:40,420
when you get out,

00:25:40,486 --> 00:25:42,588
you can take her
to the prom.

00:25:47,427 --> 00:25:49,462
She's going to be so proud
of you, Daddy.

00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:51,531
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:25:51,597 --> 00:25:54,967
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:25:59,806 --> 00:26:01,808
It was an accident.

00:26:01,874 --> 00:26:04,944
You want a tissue
or something?

00:26:05,011 --> 00:26:06,145
No.

00:26:07,613 --> 00:26:10,049
Hmm?

00:26:11,217 --> 00:26:13,352
We were in the shop.

00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:16,089
<i>Real late,</i>
<i>no one else there.</i>

00:26:16,155 --> 00:26:20,326
<i>I'd made some changes</i>
<i>to Smash-n-Burn's program.</i>

00:26:20,393 --> 00:26:22,662
<i>We were testing them out.</i>

00:26:22,728 --> 00:26:25,865
Smash was acting...
really flaky.

00:26:25,932 --> 00:26:28,201
Sluggish, and then...

00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:30,837
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:26:30,903 --> 00:26:34,073
It just went crazy.

00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,509
With all that blood.

00:26:36,576 --> 00:26:38,811
And... Chris...

00:26:38,878 --> 00:26:41,481
in the middle of it
just lying there.

00:26:41,547 --> 00:26:44,484
I had to make
it go away.

00:26:45,852 --> 00:26:47,987
Hey...

00:26:48,054 --> 00:26:50,189
Hey, Brian.

00:26:50,256 --> 00:26:52,825
If it was an accident,
why didn't you report it?

00:26:52,892 --> 00:26:55,128
It was my fault.

00:26:55,194 --> 00:26:57,263
I was... I was so scared.

00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,832
You disposed of the body.

00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:03,035
Cleaned up the scene,
dismantled the bot,

00:27:03,102 --> 00:27:04,403
and sold the parts.

00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,272
All I could think about
was my wife,

00:27:06,339 --> 00:27:08,074
and my little girl.

00:27:08,141 --> 00:27:09,509
My little girl.

00:27:09,575 --> 00:27:12,211
I didn't want
to lose them.

00:27:12,278 --> 00:27:13,946
You got to believe me.

00:27:14,013 --> 00:27:15,448
It was an accident.

00:27:15,515 --> 00:27:16,449
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:27:16,516 --> 00:27:17,750
I'm so sorry.

00:27:17,817 --> 00:27:19,752
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:22,522
I'm so sorry.

00:27:22,588 --> 00:27:24,557
The bank flagged Keith
Mercer's ATM card.

00:27:24,624 --> 00:27:25,792
Really?

00:27:25,858 --> 00:27:27,160
Somebody tried
to use it.

00:27:27,226 --> 00:27:28,361
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:27:28,428 --> 00:27:29,796
I guess the machine ate it, huh?

00:27:29,862 --> 00:27:32,465
Yeah, but we got
the stomach contents.

00:27:32,532 --> 00:27:34,233
Wicked.

00:28:08,868 --> 00:28:10,837
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:28:12,305 --> 00:28:14,373
( <i>beeps</i> )

00:28:16,442 --> 00:28:17,643
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:28:19,078 --> 00:28:21,380
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:28:28,154 --> 00:28:31,390
VEGA:
You're not Keith Mercer,
but you have been

00:28:31,457 --> 00:28:32,391
using his credit cards.

00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:33,760
Do you care to tell us
about that?

00:28:33,826 --> 00:28:35,762
He lent me his stuff,
told me

00:28:35,828 --> 00:28:36,929
to have a
good time.

00:28:36,996 --> 00:28:39,098
When did he tell you this?

00:28:39,165 --> 00:28:40,233
Yesterday.

00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:41,534
GRISSOM:
Yesterday?

00:28:41,601 --> 00:28:42,535
Mm-hmm.

00:28:42,602 --> 00:28:45,304
Mr. Mercer's been
in the morgue for ten days.

00:28:45,371 --> 00:28:47,206
So unless
you were at a seance.

00:28:47,273 --> 00:28:49,075
I found him. Uh...

00:28:49,142 --> 00:28:51,310
Did you find
that suit there as well?

00:28:51,377 --> 00:28:52,912
No. I-I bought the suit.

00:28:52,979 --> 00:28:55,081
With this credit card?

00:28:56,182 --> 00:28:57,817
No. Um...

00:28:58,785 --> 00:29:00,153
I used this one.

00:29:00,219 --> 00:29:01,387
It's not a platinum.

00:29:01,454 --> 00:29:03,055
It's a... it's a gold.

00:29:12,732 --> 00:29:16,035
So these are Willy
Reddington's original gear.

00:29:16,102 --> 00:29:17,537
This guy was classy.

00:29:17,603 --> 00:29:20,406
He goes into a store,
buys new clothes,

00:29:20,473 --> 00:29:21,874
and leaves the old ones behind.

00:29:21,941 --> 00:29:23,643
And they tossed them
in the Dumpster.

00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:25,845
I wish these people would
start checking IDs.

00:29:25,912 --> 00:29:27,146
This is Vegas, baby.

00:29:27,213 --> 00:29:28,414
Anybody gets lucky.

00:29:28,481 --> 00:29:29,415
So, blood?

00:29:29,482 --> 00:29:30,116
Not a drop.

00:29:33,753 --> 00:29:35,788
No blood on his clothing.

00:29:36,722 --> 00:29:38,791
The shoe treads don't match.

00:29:38,858 --> 00:29:41,327
And the guy's got no car.

00:29:41,394 --> 00:29:43,162
Yeah, how do you dump
a body with no car?

00:29:43,229 --> 00:29:45,131
What did he do, drag
Mercer down the Strip?

00:29:45,198 --> 00:29:48,267
And if you're robbing a house,
why don't you take more stuff?

00:29:48,334 --> 00:29:49,602
Everything was still there.

00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:51,971
Except the
coin collection.

00:29:53,506 --> 00:29:56,109
I think the killer knew
what he was going to steal.

00:29:56,175 --> 00:29:58,311
Smash-n-Burn isn't some
cyborg death machine

00:29:58,377 --> 00:29:59,479
with a mind of its own.

00:29:59,545 --> 00:30:00,980
Man, you've got to drive them.

00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:03,015
Well, we proved it
couldn't have happened

00:30:03,082 --> 00:30:04,584
the way that Brian
said it did.

00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,885
You may have your killer.

00:30:05,952 --> 00:30:07,954
Yeah.

00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:56,536
It's not responding.

00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:04,610
You've got a
transmitter module
in the remote

00:31:04,677 --> 00:31:06,045
and a receiver
module in the bot.

00:31:06,112 --> 00:31:07,447
They work
as a pair.

00:31:07,513 --> 00:31:09,916
Yeah, and in every competition,
each team

00:31:09,982 --> 00:31:12,218
is assigned a different
numbered frequency.

00:31:12,285 --> 00:31:14,554
That way, each driver
can control their bot

00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,456
without interfering
with anybody else's.

00:31:16,522 --> 00:31:17,523
Or vice versa.

00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,991
This is Smash-n-Burn's receiver.

00:31:19,058 --> 00:31:21,060
Yeah, and this is
Brian's transmitter.

00:31:23,362 --> 00:31:27,500
They don't match.

00:31:27,567 --> 00:31:29,402
Okay, so when Christian died,

00:31:29,469 --> 00:31:31,537
Brian wasn't controlling
the bot.

00:31:31,604 --> 00:31:32,505
Somebody was.

00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:39,959
Brian claims the
bot malfunctioned.

00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:40,834
Well, we know it didn't.

00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:41,583
It was responding

00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:43,184
to a different
control frequency.

00:31:43,251 --> 00:31:44,553
I don't think
he knew that.

00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:46,555
If he did, he was
protecting somebody.

00:31:46,621 --> 00:31:47,856
Hey, boss.

00:31:47,923 --> 00:31:49,491
Um, I wasn't able
to pull any DNA

00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:51,192
off your vic's
personal effects

00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:53,542
but I did find
something else.

00:31:53,542 --> 00:31:55,243
Uh, those yellow spots
on his belt...

00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,745
I ran them
through the GCMS.

00:31:56,812 --> 00:31:58,080
You ran it?

00:31:58,146 --> 00:31:59,081
Yeah.

00:31:59,147 --> 00:32:00,415
They're sulfur.

00:32:00,482 --> 00:32:02,451
Now, Warrick
mentioned something

00:32:02,517 --> 00:32:04,519
about a missing
coin collection.

00:32:04,586 --> 00:32:07,322
Now, some dealers--
bad ones-- use sulfur

00:32:07,389 --> 00:32:09,224
to polish up
coins for sale.

00:32:10,392 --> 00:32:12,594
<i>Shake and bake.</i>

00:32:17,265 --> 00:32:19,901
So I figure
that your killer

00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,204
is either a coin dealer
or a collector.

00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,041
And he transferred
the sulfur to the body

00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:25,276
when disposing of it.

00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:27,643
Are you a numismatist,
Greg?

00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:30,913
Oh, my grandpa started me off
with a 1909 V.D.B.

00:32:30,979 --> 00:32:32,314
"S" Lincoln penny.

00:32:32,381 --> 00:32:33,649
Often referred to as a V.D.B.

00:32:33,716 --> 00:32:35,751
because it bears the monogram
of its engraver,

00:32:35,818 --> 00:32:37,319
Victor D. Brenner.

00:32:37,386 --> 00:32:38,954
It's a low mintage.

00:32:39,021 --> 00:32:41,156
So, let's see, you surf,
you scuba dive,

00:32:41,223 --> 00:32:42,291
you're into latex...

00:32:42,358 --> 00:32:44,560
you like fashion models

00:32:44,626 --> 00:32:45,928
and Marilyn Manson.

00:32:45,994 --> 00:32:48,464
And you also have
a coin collection.

00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,932
Weird, huh?

00:32:49,998 --> 00:32:52,167
Well...

00:32:52,234 --> 00:32:54,670
I raise cockroaches.

00:32:57,106 --> 00:32:59,274
WILLOWS:
Look available.

00:32:59,341 --> 00:33:00,943
Be unobtainable.

00:33:01,009 --> 00:33:03,078
Except when you're trying
to beat a murder rap.

00:33:03,145 --> 00:33:04,279
Excuse me?

00:33:04,346 --> 00:33:05,581
Whatever you
did worked.

00:33:05,647 --> 00:33:07,049
Brian's going
down for you.

00:33:07,116 --> 00:33:09,818
Oh, so, first you accuse me
of whacking Christian.

00:33:09,885 --> 00:33:11,954
Now you're accusing me
of doing Brian?

00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,455
Well, you are the queen bee.

00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,460
The drones line up

00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:16,894
to service you.

00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:19,364
What the drones do
is make bots and break bots.

00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,400
And while they're up wiring
and soldering all night long,

00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:23,868
you know where I am?

00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,436
I'm at home.

00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,640
With this.

00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,742
WILLOWS:
Does it have a name

00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,710
or did it come with the wallet?

00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:35,079
Pretty funny for a scientist.

00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,915
Let me make it easy
for you.

00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:39,751
And in case you can't spell,

00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:42,353
that "E-S-Q" means
he and his entire law firm

00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,821
are going to be
all over your ass.

00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:45,957
Next time you want
to talk to me,

00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,125
talk to him.

VEGA:
Hey, I was able to pull

00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,318
the cell phone records
for our vic.

00:33:57,385 --> 00:33:59,053
Most of the calls
went to the office,

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,555
two went to the wife.

00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,223
But there are two
who are interesting.

00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,858
Jones Collectibles.

00:34:03,925 --> 00:34:06,360
Guy is a small-time fence.

00:34:06,427 --> 00:34:08,963
That mean anything to you?

00:34:15,703 --> 00:34:17,505
Does now.

00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,641
( <i>door buzzing</i> )

00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:26,581
Anything I can help you with,
let me know.

00:34:33,387 --> 00:34:34,989
I heard that you dealt in coins.

00:34:35,056 --> 00:34:36,591
Really?

00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,025
From whom?

00:34:38,092 --> 00:34:39,093
Grissom.

00:34:40,728 --> 00:34:41,963
He's a friend of mine.

00:34:42,029 --> 00:34:43,998
We work together.

00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:46,167
Uh, looking to see
what you got.

00:34:46,234 --> 00:34:48,102
I'd like to make a trade.

00:34:50,538 --> 00:34:51,672
Why the flip?

00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:54,275
I've been meaning
to get it slabbed.

00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,843
( <i>sirens blaring in distance)</i>

00:34:58,479 --> 00:35:00,081
Not bad.

00:35:00,148 --> 00:35:01,816
No hairlines.

00:35:01,883 --> 00:35:04,452
No fly specks.

00:35:05,486 --> 00:35:08,122
You got yourself a slider.

00:35:09,157 --> 00:35:12,693
I'd like to get myself
a 1916 "D" dime.

00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,197
Been all over Vegas,
can't find one.

00:35:16,264 --> 00:35:17,965
You got any?

00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,635
I might have one,
but it's pricey.

00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:23,738
Hey, so is mine.

00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:47,061
1907 Saint Goddins

00:35:47,128 --> 00:35:51,432
double eagle gold piece.

00:35:51,499 --> 00:35:53,334
I've only seen that in books.

00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,002
And that's as close as you get.

00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,605
If you want to deal
for the "D" dime, it's yours.

00:35:57,672 --> 00:36:00,141
I'll take it.

00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:14,337
The bot was on
a different control frequency,

00:36:14,404 --> 00:36:17,375
which means someone was using
a different transmitter.

00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,458
WILLOWS:
Puppet master.

00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:20,694
Somebody else
pulling the strings.

00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,063
That would explain
why the bot was sluggish.

00:36:29,136 --> 00:36:31,458
So, what's the range of
those controllers anyway?

00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:32,417
It's limited.

00:36:32,417 --> 00:36:34,486
Definitely not outside
this building.

00:36:34,553 --> 00:36:36,354
So, if somebody hijacked
Brian's bot

00:36:36,421 --> 00:36:38,657
they'd have to be nearby,
but... obviously,

00:36:38,723 --> 00:36:39,925
out of sight.

00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:45,166
Well, there's a good place
to hide up there.

00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:47,969
Opportunity.

00:36:50,238 --> 00:36:51,739
STOKES:
Maybe we've got motive.

00:36:54,075 --> 00:36:56,144
Ooh, proud papa.

00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,945
The man who built

00:36:58,012 --> 00:36:59,947
Hammer of God.

00:37:00,014 --> 00:37:03,718
Which leaves us
with... means.

00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,088
Transmitter modules.

00:37:16,164 --> 00:37:18,499
Yeah, check out
the 80s.

00:37:18,566 --> 00:37:22,403
81, 82, 83... 85,

00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,771
86?

00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:25,373
And look what's missing: 84.

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,508
( <i>Stokes chuckles</i> )

00:37:27,575 --> 00:37:28,910
I bet I know who's got it.

00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,642
Guy came in a couple
of weeks ago

00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,083
with this collection
looking to sell.

00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:35,667
I bought it.

00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:37,769
There must be $50,000 worth
of coins in there,

00:37:37,836 --> 00:37:38,704
isn't there, Greg?

00:37:40,172 --> 00:37:42,007
At least.

00:37:42,074 --> 00:37:43,675
You must have a record

00:37:43,742 --> 00:37:44,743
of the transaction.

00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:46,244
I know I got it somewhere.

00:37:46,311 --> 00:37:47,579
Maybe it's in your car.

00:37:47,646 --> 00:37:48,880
VEGA:
Mind if we help you look?

00:37:48,947 --> 00:37:50,115
No, go ahead.

00:37:50,182 --> 00:37:52,517
I got nothing
to hide.

400 watts.

Four channels?

00:38:04,131 --> 00:38:05,232
That's state-of-the-art.

Those hot, too?

00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:08,077
It kind of looks
like the DeLorean

Trace amounts of sulfur.

You don't artificially

tone your coins,
do you, Mr. Jones?

in your car as well.

00:38:27,674 --> 00:38:30,510
Yeah, well, I cut my finger
the other day.

00:38:30,577 --> 00:38:31,911
Huh.

I get back to the lab,

I'm going to prove it.

00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,453

You couldn't kill
Christian's bot

00:39:24,397 --> 00:39:25,899
so you killed Christian.

you did this.
I didn't do it.

No place to hide now.

00:40:57,991 --> 00:41:00,427
I know what it must've been like
for you.

Having created
something,

00:41:04,097 --> 00:41:06,433
only to lose it.

You have a kid?

Yes, I have a daughter.

00:41:12,572 --> 00:41:15,141
And you think just because
you squeeze a baby out

00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:17,577
from between your legs,
you know how I feel?

00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:20,880
That's biology.

Any animal can do that.

Uh-huh.

00:41:25,418 --> 00:41:31,624
But I took a thought
from my head and I made it real.

00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:34,661
It was... perfect.

00:41:36,834 --> 00:41:39,333
I guess the
only flaw then

00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,636
was you.

00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:50,041

How about I come by Saturday
and take a look?

What happened
to your enthusiasm, Greg?

00:42:20,067 --> 00:42:23,136
Well... every time I make
another DNA match in here,

00:42:23,203 --> 00:42:26,640
my world gets a little smaller.

Out there... felt large.

00:42:29,976 --> 00:42:32,245
Out there means a pay cut.

I'm not about the money.
