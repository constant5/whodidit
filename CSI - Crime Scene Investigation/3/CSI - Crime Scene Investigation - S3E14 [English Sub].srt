00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:20,843
( <i>soft clattering</i> )

00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,792
( <i>soft squeak</i> )

00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:14,630
( <i>woman screaming</i> )

00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:19,835
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,912
Dispatch said breaking and
entering and sexual assault?

00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:31,647
Well, he never touched
the first girl.

00:01:31,714 --> 00:01:32,982
The bedroom door
was blocked.

00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:34,116
What do you mean,
"blocked"?

00:01:34,183 --> 00:01:35,217
With a treadmill.

00:01:35,284 --> 00:01:38,087
We've got two apartments here;
1213 and 1214.

00:01:38,154 --> 00:01:41,223
We think the girl in 1214
has physical findings.

00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,224
You think?

00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:43,960
Well, she locked herself
in her bedroom,

00:01:44,026 --> 00:01:45,561
won't let anyone
with a Y chromosome

00:01:45,628 --> 00:01:46,896
within 50 feet of her.

00:01:46,963 --> 00:01:48,965
Okay.

00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:51,467
That's the lucky one.

00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:54,837
Hey, guys.

00:01:54,904 --> 00:01:56,305
Catherine Willows

00:01:56,372 --> 00:01:57,340
from CSI.

00:01:57,406 --> 00:01:59,809
Could you all clear
the residence, please?

00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,243
I'm first officer, ma'am.

00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,845
I can't leave
a crime scene

00:02:02,912 --> 00:02:04,614
unless I get orders
from my CO.

00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:09,318
The victim's well-being takes
precedence over everything.

00:02:09,385 --> 00:02:11,153
Right now, this
is Joanne Crooks' apartment,

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,221
not our crime scene.

00:02:12,288 --> 00:02:15,524
So... there's the door.

00:02:15,591 --> 00:02:17,493
All right, come on.

00:02:20,696 --> 00:02:22,498
Thanks. Thank you.

00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,602
Appreciate it.

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,175
Doreen Bainbridge
locks her doors every night.

00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:35,278
Says the girl next
does the same.

00:02:35,344 --> 00:02:37,813
It's a twist lock.

00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,383
It allows
for five inches
of night air.

00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:42,051
It's very secure...

00:02:42,118 --> 00:02:44,987
unless you reach in...

00:02:47,823 --> 00:02:49,558
Three seconds.

00:02:51,694 --> 00:02:54,096
Crime of opportunity,
huh?

00:02:54,163 --> 00:02:55,965
Yeah...

00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:05,241
...except somebody was watching
this girl.

WILLOWS:
Joanne...

00:03:40,592 --> 00:03:41,894
all the guys have left.

00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,329
It's just me.

00:03:43,395 --> 00:03:45,230
I'd like to ask...

00:03:45,297 --> 00:03:48,000
I told you guys, I don't know
what he looked like, okay?

00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:49,668
It was pitch black.

00:03:49,735 --> 00:03:52,338
Well, I'm not a cop;
I'm with the crime lab.

00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:56,041
I'd, uh, I'd like
to process
the bed sheets...

00:03:56,108 --> 00:03:57,676
I don't think so.

00:03:57,743 --> 00:04:00,512
Well, would you allow me
to take samples from you?

00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:01,714
Sorry.

00:04:03,716 --> 00:04:06,018
Look, I know this
is really horrible.

00:04:06,085 --> 00:04:08,020
I want to get
the bastard off of me, okay?

00:04:08,087 --> 00:04:09,188
Off of my things.

00:04:09,254 --> 00:04:10,622
Don't you get that?

00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:13,826
Washing away evidence
hurts any chance

00:04:13,892 --> 00:04:15,327
of finding out who raped you.

00:04:15,394 --> 00:04:19,131
He didn't rape me, okay?

00:04:19,198 --> 00:04:22,668
I woke up and he was
on my chest.

00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:26,605
Look at this.

00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:29,074
It's not hair gel.

00:04:31,043 --> 00:04:33,145
If you let me recover
that evidence,

00:04:33,212 --> 00:04:35,948
we can stop him
from doing this
to somebody else.

00:04:36,015 --> 00:04:36,982
Maybe I'm selfish.

00:04:37,049 --> 00:04:38,350
I don't know;
I don't really care

00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:39,618
about anybody else right now.

00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:42,287
Well, then let's get him
for what he did to you.

00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:55,801
( <i>camera shutter clicks</i> )

00:05:36,342 --> 00:05:38,110
STOKES:
Hey, Grissom.

00:05:38,177 --> 00:05:40,346
Got what looks
like a semen stain.

00:05:40,412 --> 00:05:42,247
It's crusted,
it's not fresh.

00:05:42,314 --> 00:05:44,283
Still, it confirms
your theory

00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,086
that he's been watching her
for awhile.

00:05:48,754 --> 00:05:50,322
Hey...

00:06:02,534 --> 00:06:06,205
He's been watching
a lot of people.

00:06:06,271 --> 00:06:07,506
Well, there are hedges

00:06:07,573 --> 00:06:10,376
outside of every one of these
apartment windows--

00:06:10,442 --> 00:06:12,778
that's built-in concealment.

00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:17,683
Yeah, this guy was having
his own little
private peep show.

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,952
I...

00:06:21,186 --> 00:06:23,088
WOMAN:
Last, I would like
to thank you

00:06:23,155 --> 00:06:24,823
for working late
into the night.

00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,325
During this trial,

00:06:26,392 --> 00:06:27,993
you have heard people portray
the defendant

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,996
in glowing terms.

00:06:31,063 --> 00:06:34,233
He may be all of these things.

00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:36,068
He certainly seems likable.

00:06:36,135 --> 00:06:37,770
That doesn't change the fact

00:06:37,836 --> 00:06:41,006
that he got behind the wheel
of his car legally drunk,

00:06:41,073 --> 00:06:43,842
and drove through
an intersection,

00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:47,680
killing Shelley Daniels,
a 12-year-old child.

00:06:47,746 --> 00:06:51,750
When you go
into that jury room,

00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:55,254
I ask that you seek justice

00:06:55,321 --> 00:06:57,856
and return with a verdict
of guilty.

00:06:57,923 --> 00:07:00,092
Not for me,
not for His Honor,

00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:02,261
not even
for Shelly Daniels.

00:07:02,328 --> 00:07:06,532
I ask because justice itself
demands it.

00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:09,601
Justice is greater
than our personal feelings.

00:07:09,668 --> 00:07:12,771
Than... revenge,
than... than pity.

00:07:12,838 --> 00:07:17,042
Do not shrink,
do not disappoint,
but rather...

00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:20,212
embrace it.

00:07:22,414 --> 00:07:24,383
Thank you.

00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,553
JUDGE:
The jury may retire
to the jury room.

00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:30,422
I'll advise counsel
when the jury has
reached a verdict.

00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:34,893
Where do I sign up?

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,329
I wish you could.

00:07:37,396 --> 00:07:39,898
I'm sorry. Thank you
for coming on
such short notice.

00:07:39,965 --> 00:07:41,467
Your message said
it was important.

00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:43,469
Yes, <i>People v. Archer.</i>

00:07:43,535 --> 00:07:44,870
Trial's on deck this Thursday.

00:07:44,937 --> 00:07:45,904
I prepped all weekend.

00:07:45,971 --> 00:07:46,905
It should be
a slam dunk.

00:07:46,972 --> 00:07:48,240
Great.

00:07:48,307 --> 00:07:51,677
I've handed the case over
to another D.A., Greg Rubio.

00:07:51,744 --> 00:07:52,878
What?

00:07:52,945 --> 00:07:55,714
He's quick on forensics,
he's great on game day.

00:07:55,781 --> 00:07:57,583
Melissa, we've been building
this case together

00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,651
for six months.

00:07:58,717 --> 00:07:59,752
What's going on?

00:08:01,787 --> 00:08:03,689
I'll be dead.

00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,461
I never felt comfortable
asking you about your, uh...

00:08:09,528 --> 00:08:10,763
My wheels?

00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:12,965
I mean, I know somebody
broke into your house

00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:14,266
shot you
and your husband.

00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,136
Made me a widow,
left me a souvenir.

00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:25,511
At the time, the doctors said
if they removed it, I'd die.

00:08:25,577 --> 00:08:30,015
But in the last few years,
the bullet has meandered.

00:08:30,082 --> 00:08:32,918
Last week, my voice
gives out during a cross.

00:08:32,985 --> 00:08:34,553
I have trouble
swallowing.

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,689
Hand starts to shake.

00:08:36,755 --> 00:08:40,859
My neuro calls it "traumatic
basilar artery aneurysm."

00:08:40,926 --> 00:08:43,028
Um, he has to "clip" the artery.

00:08:43,095 --> 00:08:46,065
Well, if they're fixing
the artery, that's good.

00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:48,167
The operation's delicate.

00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:51,870
The odds are, well... low.

00:08:51,937 --> 00:08:54,673
I've really enjoyed
working with you, Sara.

00:09:06,552 --> 00:09:07,586
Greg...

00:09:07,653 --> 00:09:09,655
get anywhere
with the semen

00:09:09,722 --> 00:09:10,990
I recovered
from Joanne Crooks' hair?

00:09:11,056 --> 00:09:12,124
I sent it back
with an officer.

00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,059
Uh, low volume,
no sperm.

00:09:14,126 --> 00:09:15,961
That's impossible.

00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:18,330
Yeah, I knew you'd say that.

00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:24,003
Oh, the trailer
before the movie.

00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:25,371
Sorry.

00:09:26,505 --> 00:09:28,374
Hey, Grissom,
thanks for the lift.

00:09:29,942 --> 00:09:31,443
Grissom, uh...

00:09:32,945 --> 00:09:33,946
Grissom?

00:09:35,414 --> 00:09:37,850
( <i>soft, distorted</i> ):
That must be some
good evidence.

00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,652
You have evidence?

00:09:39,718 --> 00:09:42,521
( <i>distortion continues):</i>
No.

00:09:42,588 --> 00:09:44,423
It turns out

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,226
the semen in the vic's hair

00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:49,561
was pre-ejaculate,
which, of course,

00:09:49,628 --> 00:09:52,097
( <i>louder and clearer):</i>
carries no sperm,
therefore, no DNA.

00:09:52,164 --> 00:09:54,199
( <i>normal voice</i> ):
So, I got

00:09:54,266 --> 00:09:56,035
this poor woman's hopes up
for nothing.

00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:57,136
How about you?

00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:00,839
I went back
to the crime stats...

00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:03,409
pulled up all the reported
Peeping Toms

00:10:03,475 --> 00:10:06,045
in a two-block radius
over the last year.

00:10:08,414 --> 00:10:10,916
Unsolved...

00:10:10,983 --> 00:10:12,718
Any of these women
get a description?

00:10:12,785 --> 00:10:14,653
He had "raccoon eyes."

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,655
And that's
about it.

00:10:16,722 --> 00:10:19,525
Plus, nobody called in
any follow-up reports.

00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:22,895
Well, I guess half the problem's
the name-- "Peeping Tom."

00:10:22,961 --> 00:10:24,496
It just sounds so innocuous

00:10:24,563 --> 00:10:26,799
when, in fact, peeping
is the first step

00:10:26,865 --> 00:10:29,034
in the evolution
of a sexual predator.

00:10:29,101 --> 00:10:32,905
And I'm afraid our Tom
is on an escalated pace.

00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:36,241
Tonight was
his first breaking
and entering

00:10:36,308 --> 00:10:39,745
with an immediate second B&amp;amp;E
plus what appears to be

00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:42,214
his first
sexual assault.

00:10:42,281 --> 00:10:44,116
Well, we know what road
this guy's on.

00:10:44,183 --> 00:10:47,019
It's just a matter of time
before he rapes and murders.

00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:51,490
Yeah... we better find him.

00:10:57,296 --> 00:10:59,832
Victims' profile:
Both women are single, under 30,

00:10:59,898 --> 00:11:02,501
live right next door
to each other

00:11:02,568 --> 00:11:03,769
in a large
apartment complex.

00:11:03,836 --> 00:11:05,404
Have we had any luck
on cross-referencing

00:11:05,471 --> 00:11:06,705
any of the guys in their lives?

00:11:06,772 --> 00:11:08,907
Uh, no crossover so far.

00:11:08,974 --> 00:11:12,578
Doreen Bainbridge
works in the corporate field

00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:14,413
and Joanne Crooks is a dancer,

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,500
so feels like completely
different social circles.

00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,625
But they're in
the predator's comfort zone

00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,291
which means he probably
lives in the area, too.

00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,292
What else?

00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:23,061
We're still working on
some shoe prints

00:11:23,127 --> 00:11:24,362
but the plaster's still wet.

00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:25,697
Blow dry it.

00:11:25,763 --> 00:11:28,099
It'll give us approximate height
and shoe size.

00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,268
Yeah, and the semen sample
I recovered

00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:31,836
is still being
processed in DNA.
Not anymore.

00:11:31,903 --> 00:11:33,238
I'm done.

00:11:33,304 --> 00:11:34,706
And no jokes about me being fast

00:11:34,772 --> 00:11:36,474
in this department.

00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,943
The ejaculate outside
the first girl's window--

00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,778
Spank high?
Good news:

00:11:40,845 --> 00:11:41,846
it does have DNA.

00:11:41,913 --> 00:11:43,348
Whose?
I don't know.

00:11:43,414 --> 00:11:45,216
Ran it through CODIS,
nothing kicked out.

00:11:45,283 --> 00:11:46,918
Well, it's possible
this guy's so new

00:11:46,985 --> 00:11:48,386
he doesn't even have a record.

00:11:48,453 --> 00:11:50,154
Well, I can tell you
this about him:

00:11:50,221 --> 00:11:51,756
really low sperm count.

00:11:51,823 --> 00:11:53,391
Sample hardly had
any swimmers.

00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,994
That's probably from
excessive masturbation.

00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,664
Guy's been outpacing his
ability to produce sperm.

00:11:59,731 --> 00:12:01,532
Yeah, you'd know it, Spanky.

00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:02,634
It's just a hunch.

00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,068
Hey, that can happen
to any guy.

00:12:04,135 --> 00:12:07,138
WARRICK:
Yeah, not outside
some poor woman's
bedroom window.

00:12:07,205 --> 00:12:09,274
All right,
let's keep after it.

00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,442
This guy won't stop
till he's caught.

00:12:19,384 --> 00:12:20,652
Hey, Doc.

00:12:20,718 --> 00:12:21,786
You got a minute?

00:12:21,853 --> 00:12:22,887
Sure, just finishing.

00:12:22,954 --> 00:12:26,057
Some people actually do
die of natural causes

00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:27,659
in Vegas you know.
So I hear.

00:12:27,725 --> 00:12:28,760
So what's on your mind?

00:12:28,826 --> 00:12:32,063
Um... a friend of mine's
going in for surgery.

00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,365
Traumatic basilar
artery aneurysm.

00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:37,669
You, uh, mind
walking me through it?

00:12:37,735 --> 00:12:39,337
It's a rough procedure.

00:12:39,404 --> 00:12:42,040
The basilar is the chief blood
supplier to the brain stem.

00:12:42,106 --> 00:12:43,675
Here, I'll show you.

00:12:43,741 --> 00:12:46,411
They put the patient
under hypothermic arrest,

00:12:46,477 --> 00:12:48,813
meaning the heart
will be stopped

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,583
and blood artificially
circulated.

00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:54,719
The objective is
to decrease blood pressure

00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:56,254
so the aneurysm can be clipped.

00:12:56,321 --> 00:12:59,424
Imagine taking a
knife to a balloon.

00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,260
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:13:03,962 --> 00:13:06,364
<i>The neurosurgeon</i>
<i>has just under an hour.</i>

00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,333
<i>One slip, the artery ruptures</i>

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,236
<i>causing a catastrophic</i>
<i>brain hemorrhage.</i>

00:13:11,302 --> 00:13:13,771
She said she was going to die.

00:13:13,838 --> 00:13:17,542
Nine out of ten times, Sara.

00:13:17,609 --> 00:13:19,577
I'm sure her doctor told her.

00:13:19,644 --> 00:13:21,980
Thanks.

00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:26,251
Excuse me, do you know
where I can find Dr. Stewart?

00:13:26,317 --> 00:13:27,518
Thanks.

00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:30,521
Dr. Stewart.
Sara Sidle.

00:13:30,588 --> 00:13:32,123
I'm a friend of
Melissa Winters.

00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,726
She pulled through.
No change to mobility
She did?

00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:36,461
but cognitively,
she'll be sharp as ever.

00:13:36,527 --> 00:13:38,096
Not quite ready to
entertain visitors

00:13:38,162 --> 00:13:39,430
but you can
drop by tomorrow.

00:13:39,497 --> 00:13:42,000
Thanks. Thank you.
Okay.

00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:43,234
Hey, Doc.

00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:45,236
Yeah?
When you were in there

00:13:45,303 --> 00:13:47,272
did you, by any chance,
remove the bullet?

00:13:47,338 --> 00:13:48,673
Yeah, after I repaired
the artery

00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,309
I figured it couldn't do any
more damage than it already has.

00:13:51,376 --> 00:13:52,944
You think I could have it?

00:13:53,011 --> 00:13:54,312
I'm, uh...

00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:55,613
I'm with the Crime Lab.

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,649
It's the only evidence
in a cold case.

00:13:57,715 --> 00:13:59,684
Yeah. Wait here and
I'll have it sent out.

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,289
( <i>whirring</i> )

00:14:29,714 --> 00:14:31,082
Hey, how's it coming?

00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:32,217
Good.

00:14:32,283 --> 00:14:34,652
Looks like I got a size eight.

00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:36,821
Check back with me,
I should have more
in a bit.

00:14:36,888 --> 00:14:37,789
All right.

00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:40,992
Hey, Jacqui.

00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:42,894
Grissom's print
any good?

00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:44,262
The deposition
pressure's heavy.

00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:46,397
The guy was really
pressing hard on that window.

00:14:46,464 --> 00:14:47,865
With one hand, anyway.

00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:52,136
Okay, well, that's a lot
of distortion.
Yeah.

00:14:52,203 --> 00:14:53,605
Platform ridges
of the latent print

00:14:53,671 --> 00:14:55,173
were affected by
the shift of the core

00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,874
away from the triradius.

00:14:56,941 --> 00:14:58,109
So can you enhance the ridges

00:14:58,176 --> 00:14:59,644
equal to the amount
of the slippage?

00:14:59,711 --> 00:15:01,479
Mm-hmm. With the help
of this software.

00:15:09,587 --> 00:15:11,623
Now let's hope this guy's
in one of our databases.

00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:12,857
Well, I'd run APIS last.

00:15:12,924 --> 00:15:14,959
I doubt if he's in there;
he wasn't in CODIS.

00:15:15,026 --> 00:15:16,594
No criminal record?

00:15:16,661 --> 00:15:18,329
We're dealing with a newbie,
a teenager.

00:15:18,396 --> 00:15:19,998
It's kind of looking like that.

00:15:30,742 --> 00:15:32,644
Justin Lamond, 18.

00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:35,346
Non-gaming card.

00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:36,981
He's a pool boy at the Tangiers.

00:15:37,048 --> 00:15:39,584
Oh, and look at that.

00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:42,153
He lives one block
from the crime scene.

00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,922
Thanks, Jacqui.

00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,491
Hey.

00:15:46,558 --> 00:15:47,825
Hey.

00:15:47,892 --> 00:15:49,494
So the owner of
the pool company says

00:15:49,561 --> 00:15:52,430
he spends his lunch hour
here every day.

00:15:52,497 --> 00:15:54,566
Well, that's what
he looks like.

00:16:00,038 --> 00:16:01,940
I'll be this way.

00:16:30,435 --> 00:16:32,971
Jim.

00:16:34,272 --> 00:16:35,506
There, that's him.

00:16:37,675 --> 00:16:41,446
Yeah, how can you miss him?
Kid's pitching a tent.

00:16:47,018 --> 00:16:48,987
Justin Lamond?

00:16:49,053 --> 00:16:50,922
Yeah?
Come with me,
Justin.

00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:52,056
Hey...

00:16:52,123 --> 00:16:53,224
nice fanny pack.

00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,727
I mean, I'm a
wallet guy myself,
but I can change.

00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:57,061
Mind if I take
a look at yours?

00:16:57,128 --> 00:16:58,062
I'm not doing anything.

00:16:58,129 --> 00:16:59,597
Pack's a camouflage.

00:16:59,664 --> 00:17:02,834
And check out the tip
of his right shoe.

00:17:11,776 --> 00:17:13,044
It's a spy camera.

00:17:13,111 --> 00:17:15,613
What, you can't peep in
apartments during the day

00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,182
so you come to the mall
to sneak some thrills?

00:17:18,249 --> 00:17:20,385
I don't know what
you're talking about.
I'm late for work.

00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:22,353
No, your lunch hour
just got very long.

00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,521
Put him in the car.

00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:25,924
Heck of a lot of tissue
attached.

00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,293
Let me guess-- this has been
in your victim for a while.

00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,394
Three years.

00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,195
Prosecutor friend of mine
walked in to find

00:17:31,262 --> 00:17:32,330
a guy shooting her husband,

00:17:32,397 --> 00:17:33,631
then he turned the gun on her.

00:17:33,698 --> 00:17:35,133
She just had it
surgically removed.

00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:37,468
The human body's amazing.
Three years.

00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:40,505
Tissue forms around the
projectile protecting the body

00:17:40,572 --> 00:17:41,773
from the leaching of the lead.

00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,708
Hang on a second.

00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:45,310
You get approval from Grissom?

00:17:45,376 --> 00:17:46,811
I don't want him
walking in on me.

00:17:46,878 --> 00:17:47,812
Yeah.

00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:49,480
Sara Sidle...?

00:17:49,547 --> 00:17:50,682
Yeah, I did.

00:17:50,748 --> 00:17:52,417
All right, just checking.

00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:54,152
Let's go.

00:17:57,355 --> 00:18:01,559
Enzymatic detergent
ought to clean
this baby up.

00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:14,572
Still stained.

00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:17,041
All righty...

00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:18,710
time to get serious.

00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:28,486
( <i>low buzzing</i> )

00:18:28,553 --> 00:18:30,288
Hey, hey, careful
with that bullet,

00:18:30,355 --> 00:18:31,289
it's my only evidence.

00:18:31,356 --> 00:18:33,124
I thought you said the
husband got shot, too.

00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:34,292
It was a through
and through.

00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:36,361
The bullet decimated upon
impact with the couch...

00:18:36,427 --> 00:18:38,630
with the couch frame.

00:18:47,171 --> 00:18:51,476
Hey, clean as a whistle.

00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:53,077
We're good to go.

00:18:53,144 --> 00:18:54,445
I'll run it through IBIS.

00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:55,847
Thank you.

00:18:55,914 --> 00:18:56,948
Page me?

00:18:57,015 --> 00:18:58,082
Yeah, sure thing.

00:18:58,149 --> 00:19:00,118
( <i>door closes</i> )

00:19:00,184 --> 00:19:02,020
How long you been doing this--

00:19:02,086 --> 00:19:05,156
videotaping women
without their knowledge?

00:19:05,223 --> 00:19:07,892
It's only breaking the law
if you record their voices.

00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:09,827
He's a smart kid, huh?

00:19:09,894 --> 00:19:11,663
Oh, come on...

00:19:11,729 --> 00:19:13,565
look at the girls
out there.

00:19:13,631 --> 00:19:15,667
They wear see-through tops,
short skirts

00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:16,668
bellies all on show.

00:19:16,734 --> 00:19:17,902
They so much want it.

00:19:17,969 --> 00:19:19,337
So I catch
some money shots.

00:19:19,404 --> 00:19:22,540
Well, let's look
at the young Kubrick's
money shot, shall we?

00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:44,062
You guys are looking at me
like I'm some scab.

00:19:44,128 --> 00:19:47,899
I don't do toilets, fat chicks,
blue vein, crush stuff.

00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:49,601
Just low-tech voyeur.

00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:50,935
That's reassuring.

00:19:51,002 --> 00:19:52,503
Do you know
Doreen Bainbridge?

00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,472
No.

00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,374
We found your fingerprints
on her window.

00:19:56,441 --> 00:19:57,942
And also a little
love graffiti

00:19:58,009 --> 00:19:59,277
on the wall outside.

00:19:59,344 --> 00:20:03,281
I spy, I don't engage.

00:20:03,348 --> 00:20:05,683
Well, remind me
to give you a medal.

00:20:10,488 --> 00:20:12,357
Stand up.

00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,662
Step down.

00:20:17,729 --> 00:20:19,564
Both feet.

00:20:39,951 --> 00:20:40,985
It's not a match.

00:20:41,052 --> 00:20:42,220
You got to be
kidding me.

00:20:42,287 --> 00:20:43,755
Three-size differential.

00:20:43,821 --> 00:20:45,590
He was obviously outside
Doreen's apartment,

00:20:45,657 --> 00:20:47,058
but he's not our guy.

00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,059
He's my guy.

00:20:48,126 --> 00:20:49,594
Justin Lamond...

00:20:49,661 --> 00:20:51,896
sexually
motivated offense,
indecent exposure,

00:20:51,963 --> 00:20:54,065
gross lewdness.
Let's go to booking.

00:20:54,132 --> 00:20:55,900
Try to keep it on ice.

00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:58,002
What's up?

00:20:58,069 --> 00:21:01,005
Hey, this cast that poured
into the shoe print

00:21:01,072 --> 00:21:03,541
that I found outside that
victim's bedroom window...

00:21:04,442 --> 00:21:06,211
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:21:06,277 --> 00:21:08,313
Pulled off some trace
materials from it.

00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:10,782
It's like a yellow substance.
It may be paint.

00:21:10,848 --> 00:21:12,450
Take a look and tell me
what you think.

00:21:12,517 --> 00:21:13,551
Check it out.

00:21:13,618 --> 00:21:14,552
Yeah.

00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:16,287
<i>With glass.</i>

00:21:16,354 --> 00:21:17,589
<i>Reflective glass.</i>

00:21:17,655 --> 00:21:21,392
Yeah, I'm thinking maybe
road paint...

00:21:21,459 --> 00:21:24,128
crosswalk...
lane markings maybe.

00:21:24,195 --> 00:21:27,565
So our suspect stepped in
wet maintenance paint.

00:21:27,632 --> 00:21:29,033
That stuff dries pretty fast.

00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,704
So he must've stepped in it
on his way to the scene.

00:21:34,272 --> 00:21:37,008
Which could tell us what
direction he's coming from.

00:21:37,075 --> 00:21:39,677
Let me call my guy in
the Department of Transpo.

00:21:44,515 --> 00:21:46,985
Still charting
recent Toms?

00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:48,253
Architecture.

00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:50,221
He has a type.

00:21:50,288 --> 00:21:53,458
All these buildings
that recently reported
Peeping Toms?

00:21:53,524 --> 00:21:56,060
Got floor plans from
the management company.

00:21:56,127 --> 00:21:58,630
A-- second story, three bedroom.

00:21:58,696 --> 00:22:02,533
B-- ground floor, two bedrooms,
center lots.

00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,637
C... C-plans are all one bedroom
on the end.

00:22:05,703 --> 00:22:07,906
Cheapest rent,
highest foot traffic

00:22:07,972 --> 00:22:09,340
easiest to break in.

00:22:09,407 --> 00:22:10,842
He's a C-level man.

00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:11,943
Yeah.

00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,946
And every apartment has
sliding doors and windows.

00:22:15,013 --> 00:22:17,348
Not one sash, not one French.

00:22:17,415 --> 00:22:20,051
And he gets there on foot,
from east of Avon.

00:22:20,118 --> 00:22:21,352
You found his epicenter?

00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:22,720
Closing in on it.

00:22:22,787 --> 00:22:25,123
The city painted
double yellows

00:22:25,189 --> 00:22:26,658
down Taylor Road last night.

00:22:26,724 --> 00:22:28,860
Started at 10:00 at Avon Avenue.

00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:31,629
The paint crew goes
three miles an hour.

00:22:31,696 --> 00:22:33,398
That puts them
at Taylor and Cedar--

00:22:33,464 --> 00:22:36,534
the victims' apartments-- at
approximately 20 after 10:00,

00:22:36,601 --> 00:22:37,835
just before the attacks.

00:22:37,902 --> 00:22:39,671
Predators usually widen
their comfort zone

00:22:39,737 --> 00:22:42,273
in a spiral pattern outward.

00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:51,149
My God, look at all
the C-level apartments.

00:22:51,216 --> 00:22:53,251
P.D.'s going to have
to triple their presence.

00:22:53,318 --> 00:22:55,320
Quadruple it.

00:22:55,386 --> 00:22:57,989
GRISSOM:
<i>He hit two apartments</i>
<i>in one night.</i>

00:22:58,056 --> 00:23:00,325
<i>He's become compulsive.</i>

00:23:00,391 --> 00:23:03,995
WILLOWS:
<i>Predators get smarter</i>
<i>with every attack.</i>

00:23:04,062 --> 00:23:05,129
<i>It's been in the news.</i>

00:23:05,196 --> 00:23:07,065
<i>He may be wearing gloves</i>
<i>this time.</i>

00:23:07,131 --> 00:23:09,934
GRISSOM:
<i>Yeah, he's evolving...</i>

00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:11,669
<i>perfecting.</i>

00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:16,576
( <i>telephone ringing</i> )

00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:19,185
AV Lab. Grissom.

00:23:19,252 --> 00:23:20,987
Your sexual assailant
moved up to rape.

00:23:21,054 --> 00:23:22,555
Would you be exact, please?

00:23:22,622 --> 00:23:23,556
490 Kildare Road.

00:23:23,623 --> 00:23:25,191
Get here as soon as you can.

00:23:25,258 --> 00:23:26,259
Thank you.

00:23:36,202 --> 00:23:37,337
Aren't you coming?

00:23:37,403 --> 00:23:40,340
You can handle it.

00:23:40,406 --> 00:23:44,410
High-profile case,
technicalities...

00:23:44,477 --> 00:23:46,012
That can't be why
you do this,

00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,680
why you hang back
and hide out.

00:23:47,747 --> 00:23:50,683
You look better
on-camera.

00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,885
Right.

00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:53,553
I didn't think so.

00:23:58,691 --> 00:23:59,826
BRASS:
So where's Grissom?

00:23:59,893 --> 00:24:01,027
Supervising.

00:24:01,094 --> 00:24:03,162
So I'm listening to news
radio on the way over here

00:24:03,229 --> 00:24:05,231
and they're calling him
the sliding-door rapist.

00:24:05,298 --> 00:24:07,033
Well, we got Susie Spiegel.

00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,302
She was unable
to ID her assailant.

00:24:09,369 --> 00:24:11,404
There was penetration
this time.

00:24:11,471 --> 00:24:12,939
She said he was polite.

00:24:13,006 --> 00:24:14,107
He wore a condom.

00:24:14,173 --> 00:24:15,108
Polite?

00:24:15,174 --> 00:24:16,409
He's just more savvy.

00:24:16,476 --> 00:24:19,012
There's less evidence
for us to work with.

00:24:19,078 --> 00:24:20,313
I know, exactly.

00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,115
WOMAN:
Hey! Over here! Police!

00:24:22,181 --> 00:24:24,017
Come on, you pervert!
Hey! Hey!

00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:25,418
Oh, well, you're not
such a hotshot

00:24:25,485 --> 00:24:26,953
once a real woman
gets a hold of you.

00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,954
Slow it down, Xena.

00:24:28,021 --> 00:24:28,955
It's all right. Okay.

00:24:29,022 --> 00:24:30,089
Look, I saw him
in the bushes.

00:24:30,156 --> 00:24:31,090
I scared him.

00:24:31,157 --> 00:24:32,392
I know, I know.
I understand.

00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:34,460
Okay, get some ID on
these people, all right?

00:24:34,527 --> 00:24:35,895
Let's all go
downtown, all right?

00:24:35,962 --> 00:24:36,896
I got him.

00:24:36,963 --> 00:24:38,331
You're not gonna--
you're dead.

00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:39,966
Are you
all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:24:49,842 --> 00:24:51,344
Victor?

00:24:52,845 --> 00:24:54,147
Victor!

00:25:05,892 --> 00:25:07,160
Hey, Sara.

00:25:07,227 --> 00:25:09,329
Heard you reopened
the Winters case.

00:25:09,395 --> 00:25:10,863
Did you know
the lead CSI

00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,632
on this case,
Terry Flannery?

00:25:12,699 --> 00:25:14,000
Flannery. Yeah, yeah.

00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:16,202
He retired and moved
back to L.A.

00:25:17,237 --> 00:25:19,405
These are exit wounds
from the husband's back.

00:25:19,472 --> 00:25:20,473
What do you see?

00:25:22,575 --> 00:25:24,978
It's shored.

00:25:25,044 --> 00:25:26,379
There's a definite
abrasion ring.

00:25:26,446 --> 00:25:28,214
The only way
you get marks like these

00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:29,349
is when the vic's back

00:25:29,415 --> 00:25:31,718
is pressed against
something-- a floor, a wall.

00:25:31,784 --> 00:25:33,119
How did Flannery miss this?

00:25:33,186 --> 00:25:36,222
There are two CSIs you never
want investigating your murder--

00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:39,726
the one on his first week,
and the one on his last.

00:25:43,396 --> 00:25:45,365
Hey, does Melissa know
you're doing this?

00:25:45,431 --> 00:25:48,368
I don't want
to get her hopes up.

00:25:48,434 --> 00:25:49,469
She's been through a lot.

00:25:49,535 --> 00:25:50,770
You know how
some victims are.

00:25:50,837 --> 00:25:52,772
They don't really want
to know what happened.

00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:54,073
You know?

00:25:58,478 --> 00:26:00,546
( <i>pager beeping</i> )

00:26:00,613 --> 00:26:01,614
You got something?

00:26:01,681 --> 00:26:03,750
Well, why else would
I be paging you?

00:26:03,816 --> 00:26:05,818
A bullet shot
from the same gun

00:26:05,885 --> 00:26:07,854
that was recovered from
a liquor store robbery

00:26:07,921 --> 00:26:09,556
in Henderson
six months ago.

00:26:09,622 --> 00:26:11,824
Check it out.

00:26:11,891 --> 00:26:14,360
They line up perfectly.

00:26:15,395 --> 00:26:16,563
Cops recover the gun?

00:26:16,629 --> 00:26:17,697
Do you one better?

00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,733
They got the shooter.

00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,734
Roger Wilder.

00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:24,037
I'm liking you already.

00:26:25,438 --> 00:26:28,007
I don't know
any Melissa Winters.

00:26:28,074 --> 00:26:29,042
Oh, bad memory?

00:26:29,108 --> 00:26:30,109
Let me jog
it for you.

00:26:30,176 --> 00:26:31,377
She was the Assistant DA

00:26:31,444 --> 00:26:33,713
who prosecuted you
for assault five years ago.

00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,582
She got you
sentenced to four years.

00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,983
Yeah, I was out in one.

00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,184
What about her?

00:26:38,251 --> 00:26:40,019
Well, the trial transcript says

00:26:40,086 --> 00:26:42,088
at the sentencing
you yelled at her,

00:26:42,155 --> 00:26:44,057
"What goes around,
comes around."?

00:26:44,123 --> 00:26:45,725
It was a chump charge.

00:26:45,792 --> 00:26:47,527
She did a number on me.

00:26:47,594 --> 00:26:48,861
So was it just a coincidence

00:26:48,928 --> 00:26:50,863
that three weeks
after you got out of jail,

00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:53,533
Mrs. Winters and her husband
were shot in her own home?

00:26:55,301 --> 00:26:57,937
We recently recovered a bullet
from Melissa's head.

00:26:58,004 --> 00:26:59,472
It happens to match a bullet

00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:02,475
fired from the gun that you used
in your latest felony.

00:27:02,542 --> 00:27:03,977
You know what we call that?

00:27:04,043 --> 00:27:05,345
Corroborating evidence.

00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,316
I guess I'd keep
my mouth shut, too.

00:27:10,383 --> 00:27:11,451
Three years have passed.

00:27:11,517 --> 00:27:12,952
You don't have to say anything,

00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:15,321
but I have to tell you
that evidence persists.

00:27:15,388 --> 00:27:19,425
A fingerprint,
a fiber, a hair.

00:27:19,492 --> 00:27:22,795
If I find one shred

00:27:22,862 --> 00:27:24,898
of physical evidence
that places you

00:27:24,964 --> 00:27:25,899
in the Winters' house,

00:27:25,965 --> 00:27:27,367
there is not a jury
in Clark County

00:27:27,433 --> 00:27:29,168
that will not give you
the death penalty.

00:27:32,171 --> 00:27:33,439
I went to her house.

00:27:33,506 --> 00:27:35,108
Not to kill her.

00:27:35,174 --> 00:27:37,610
I wanted to see the look
on her smug-ass face

00:27:37,677 --> 00:27:39,646
when she saw
I knew where she lived.

00:27:39,712 --> 00:27:41,080
She wasn't there, all right?

00:27:41,147 --> 00:27:43,182
Did you knock
or did you use the doorbell?

00:27:43,249 --> 00:27:45,018
No one was there.

00:27:45,084 --> 00:27:47,220
I busted in, thought
I'd mess the place up

00:27:47,287 --> 00:27:48,988
and give her a nice
welcome home.

00:28:02,101 --> 00:28:04,704
A gun just fell from a table.

00:28:04,771 --> 00:28:06,673
Yep.

00:28:08,107 --> 00:28:10,343
At least I got
something out of her.

00:28:14,347 --> 00:28:17,125
Everybody tells you to get more
involved in the community,

00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:18,208
but once you do...

00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:20,253
Hey, hey, hey, you
busted a man's lip.

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,155
You broke a tooth,
you sprained his finger.

00:28:22,222 --> 00:28:23,957
Jujitsu, Shotokan.

00:28:24,023 --> 00:28:26,159
They act on their own.

00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:27,493
I am just a vessel.

00:28:28,695 --> 00:28:30,163
Shouldn't I go to the hospital?

00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,164
I was bleeding.

00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:32,465
I just have a few questions.

00:28:32,532 --> 00:28:34,867
First off, what were you doing
at those apartments?

00:28:34,934 --> 00:28:37,804
I was on my way home
from spin class on my bike

00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,806
<i>and then I saw him.</i>

00:28:39,872 --> 00:28:42,875
<i>He was in those bushes around</i>
<i>Jennifer's place and I guess</i>

00:28:42,942 --> 00:28:44,577
<i>I thought the guy'd be scary.</i>

00:28:44,644 --> 00:28:46,679
<i>You know, Night Stalker scary,</i>

00:28:46,746 --> 00:28:48,125
<i>but he was like</i>
<i>a wet French fry.</i>

00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:49,792
<i>I</i> knew <i>I could take him.</i>

00:28:50,116 --> 00:28:52,652
She was insane.
She didn't even let me explain.

00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:53,853
Try <i>me.</i>

00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,455
I was looking for an apartment.

00:28:55,521 --> 00:28:57,490
I just got a raise
and I need more space.

00:28:57,557 --> 00:29:00,426
So you decide to start your
search in the dead of night

00:29:00,493 --> 00:29:02,328
when there's
a rapist on the loose.

00:29:02,395 --> 00:29:03,596
I work days.

00:29:03,663 --> 00:29:06,132
It was in the classifieds.

00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,201
Oh.

00:29:08,268 --> 00:29:10,737
Besides, what, what's
he going to do to <i>me?</i>

00:29:10,803 --> 00:29:12,372
Well, Wendy did okay.

00:29:12,438 --> 00:29:16,376
Um, the problem I'm having
is that those apartments

00:29:16,442 --> 00:29:19,012
there's always
an availability

00:29:19,078 --> 00:29:20,513
so, um, kind of gives you

00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,483
a plausible excuse
anytime, anywhere, doesn't it?

00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,817
Oh, I like those shoes.

00:29:24,884 --> 00:29:26,119
What size are you?

00:29:26,185 --> 00:29:27,287
Eight and a half.

00:29:27,353 --> 00:29:28,488
Eight and a half, huh?

00:29:28,555 --> 00:29:30,423
Do you mind
if I look at the soles?

00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,834
You seem disappointed.

00:29:43,036 --> 00:29:45,071
Hey, how would you feel
about allowing me

00:29:45,138 --> 00:29:46,940
to look at all
your shoes from home?

00:29:47,006 --> 00:29:48,775
I mean, it'd be
strictly voluntary.

00:29:48,841 --> 00:29:49,909
I don't know if I'd

00:29:49,976 --> 00:29:51,077
be comfortable with that.

00:29:51,144 --> 00:29:52,412
A young, white male

00:29:52,478 --> 00:29:53,947
living in a targeted
neighborhood--

00:29:54,013 --> 00:29:54,948
I'd think you might

00:29:55,014 --> 00:29:56,816
want to, you know,
help rule yourself out.

00:29:56,883 --> 00:29:58,651
I value my privacy.

00:29:58,718 --> 00:30:00,320
Of course you do.

00:30:00,386 --> 00:30:01,588
Am I free to go?

00:30:01,654 --> 00:30:02,922
Yeah.

00:30:06,593 --> 00:30:07,961
Oh. Uh, Mr. Reed.

00:30:09,062 --> 00:30:11,130
If Wendy attacked you
and you're innocent,

00:30:11,197 --> 00:30:13,900
I'd think you might want
to file charges against her.

00:30:13,967 --> 00:30:14,968
How come you didn't?

00:30:15,034 --> 00:30:20,139
Uh, no. I do. Want to.
File charges, yeah.

00:30:20,206 --> 00:30:22,909
You sure? I wouldn't want you to
do anything you didn't believe.

00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,544
No, she assaulted me.
I want to file.

00:30:25,411 --> 00:30:26,713
We'll take a report.

00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,251
I want you to know

00:30:31,317 --> 00:30:32,952
once you sign
that complaint,

00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:35,588
it becomes a binding
legal document, all right?

00:30:45,465 --> 00:30:48,468
He's filing charges on me?

00:30:48,534 --> 00:30:49,335
This is ridiculous.

00:30:49,402 --> 00:30:50,336
Agreed.

00:30:50,403 --> 00:30:52,105
May I please
take that swab?

00:30:52,171 --> 00:30:55,074
Thank you.

00:30:55,141 --> 00:30:57,844
I'm going to need
that jacket, too.

00:30:57,911 --> 00:30:59,145
That's great, you know?

00:30:59,212 --> 00:31:00,947
The guy's out there raping women

00:31:01,014 --> 00:31:03,750
and I end up getting
strip-searched by the police.

00:31:03,816 --> 00:31:06,786
Wendy, I can't discuss
an ongoing case

00:31:06,853 --> 00:31:08,688
but what I can tell you

00:31:08,755 --> 00:31:10,456
is if we're going
to get this guy,

00:31:10,523 --> 00:31:13,192
it'll be because of what
you're giving us right now.

00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:14,327
Really?

00:31:14,394 --> 00:31:16,563
Really.

00:31:16,629 --> 00:31:18,331
Okay.

00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:04,419
Roger Wilder said
he was inside Melissa's house

00:32:04,486 --> 00:32:05,420
which is true.

00:32:05,487 --> 00:32:07,188
He described
the exact layout of the room.

00:32:07,255 --> 00:32:08,757
But he said he found
the gun

00:32:08,823 --> 00:32:10,692
when he destroyed
the coffee table

00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:12,994
and I have no evidence
to disprove that.

00:32:13,061 --> 00:32:14,129
Well, go for logic.

00:32:14,196 --> 00:32:16,398
Some guy breaks into
the Winters' house

00:32:16,464 --> 00:32:18,867
shoots 'em both
and leaves his gun behind?

00:32:18,934 --> 00:32:20,268
Why?

00:32:20,335 --> 00:32:22,604
I don't know.

00:32:22,671 --> 00:32:24,339
Well, if it was
really there,

00:32:24,406 --> 00:32:26,107
how come CSI
didn't find it?

00:32:26,174 --> 00:32:28,176
That's a very good question.

00:32:28,243 --> 00:32:30,946
I knew something was off
when we saw that shored wound.

00:32:31,012 --> 00:32:32,914
It didn't match up
with Melissa's account.

00:32:32,981 --> 00:32:34,649
If her husband
was standing up

00:32:34,716 --> 00:32:36,685
like Melissa said
when he was shot

00:32:36,751 --> 00:32:37,986
blood would have dripped
down from the entry wound

00:32:38,053 --> 00:32:38,987
to the belt buckle.

00:32:39,054 --> 00:32:40,855
Yeah. Gravity only
runs one way.

00:32:40,922 --> 00:32:42,424
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:32:47,162 --> 00:32:50,098
This blood trail...

00:32:50,165 --> 00:32:51,766
The only way
it's going south...

00:32:54,202 --> 00:32:57,405
He was laying down.

00:33:04,112 --> 00:33:05,347
She lied.

00:33:08,984 --> 00:33:09,918
Heya!

00:33:09,985 --> 00:33:12,254
About the blood
on kung fu lady's clothes.

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,222
Greg, I don't want
any other cases
jumping mine.

00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:15,223
This is priority.

00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,224
If I had a dime...

00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:17,259
Anticipating that,

00:33:17,325 --> 00:33:19,327
I skipped dinner
and ran the DNA through CODIS.

00:33:19,394 --> 00:33:20,362
Mm.

00:33:20,428 --> 00:33:22,197
Turns out that
your apartment hunter,

00:33:22,264 --> 00:33:24,566
that girly man,
left his double helix behind

00:33:24,633 --> 00:33:25,934
at another crime scene.

00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,072
Unknown subject,
five months ago

00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:33,508
breaking and entering,
burglary.

00:33:33,575 --> 00:33:36,545
They had nothing
to compare it to
at the time.

00:33:36,611 --> 00:33:38,046
But we do now.

00:33:38,113 --> 00:33:39,147
Mm-hmm.

00:33:47,822 --> 00:33:49,558
( <i>knocks</i> )

00:33:52,761 --> 00:33:54,529
( <i>hoarsely</i> ):
Sara, hey.

00:33:54,596 --> 00:33:55,463
Hey.

00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,598
You did it.

00:33:56,665 --> 00:34:00,468
Yeah. I beat the odds.

00:34:00,535 --> 00:34:01,603
I got lucky.

00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:02,971
Lucky and smart.

00:34:06,641 --> 00:34:08,710
I reopened your case.

00:34:08,777 --> 00:34:11,513
Yeah, my doctor mentioned it.

00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,014
He said that he gave
you the bullet.

00:34:13,081 --> 00:34:16,284
I know what
you did, Melissa.

00:34:16,351 --> 00:34:21,022
I examined
the evidence.

00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:25,327
Your husband wasn't
free-standing
in front of the couch

00:34:25,393 --> 00:34:26,328
struggling with
some stranger.

00:34:30,665 --> 00:34:32,734
TV SPORTS ANNOUNCER:
...and the Wildcats hang on...

00:34:35,036 --> 00:34:37,072
There was no stranger.

00:34:37,138 --> 00:34:42,878
He was, uh, asleep,
wasn't he? On the couch?

00:34:42,944 --> 00:34:46,381
You're the one
with the evidence.

00:34:46,448 --> 00:34:48,650
You had a CSI
who was about to retire

00:34:48,717 --> 00:34:51,419
who was predisposed
to believe the testimony

00:34:51,486 --> 00:34:56,391
of an honest prosecutor
like you.

00:34:58,994 --> 00:35:01,229
Especially since you got shot,
too?

00:35:09,371 --> 00:35:11,006
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:35:11,072 --> 00:35:16,444
See, he leaned up
from a prone position.

00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,581
( <i>sobbing</i> )

00:35:27,489 --> 00:35:29,057
( <i>hammer cocks</i> )

00:35:30,258 --> 00:35:32,194
( <i>gun drops</i> )

00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:37,465
The directionality
of the blood tells the story.

00:35:40,635 --> 00:35:43,672
I didn't understand
why I couldn't move my legs.

00:35:45,907 --> 00:35:48,877
And you couldn't let anyone
find that gun.

00:35:48,944 --> 00:35:51,313
They would have tested
your hands for GSR.

00:35:57,786 --> 00:35:59,821
( <i>gasping</i> )

00:36:12,801 --> 00:36:16,071
I thought I could go back.

00:36:16,137 --> 00:36:17,305
That I could get rid of it.

00:36:17,372 --> 00:36:19,241
Somebody else did that for you.

00:36:19,307 --> 00:36:22,510
I almost had him arrested
for a murder you committed.

00:36:22,577 --> 00:36:31,920
You would think that an attorney
could come up with a great case

00:36:31,987 --> 00:36:38,660
against an abusive husband,
but I was ashamed.

00:36:38,727 --> 00:36:42,397
I didn't want people to know
what he did to me.

00:36:42,464 --> 00:36:48,937
All your closing arguments,
all your big talk about justice.

00:36:49,004 --> 00:36:51,373
I fell for all of it.

00:36:51,439 --> 00:36:55,877
I've always believed in justice.

00:36:55,944 --> 00:36:57,379
I still do.

00:37:01,216 --> 00:37:03,618
You never expected to live,
did you?

00:37:03,685 --> 00:37:06,421
No.

00:37:08,757 --> 00:37:11,993
Out of all the CSIs,

00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,929
I knew I could depend on you.

00:37:20,468 --> 00:37:23,338
I guess I'll be seeing you
in court.

00:37:27,475 --> 00:37:29,177
Good-bye, Melissa.

00:37:58,073 --> 00:38:00,442
How's your chart
of escalation?

00:38:00,508 --> 00:38:01,443
Deescalating.

00:38:01,509 --> 00:38:03,445
I had figured
Taylor Reed was branching out,

00:38:03,511 --> 00:38:04,479
widening his circle,

00:38:04,546 --> 00:38:06,815
but after last night,
I think he's pulling in,

00:38:06,882 --> 00:38:08,884
going back
to his original comfort zone.

00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:12,053
Was one of your original
burglaries located at

00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,321
13200 Appian Way?

00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,298
Five months ago.

00:38:23,365 --> 00:38:25,700
First floor, broke in
through a sliding door.

00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:27,702
Where our guy Taylor Reed

00:38:27,769 --> 00:38:30,505
cut himself
on the glass.

00:38:30,572 --> 00:38:32,774
So, we've narrowed
the epicenter down

00:38:32,841 --> 00:38:34,709
to a single block--
Appian Way.

00:38:34,776 --> 00:38:37,112
I'm thinking if we find
something overlooked

00:38:37,178 --> 00:38:39,147
at those early crime
scenes on Appian

00:38:39,214 --> 00:38:41,182
we can tie it
to our sexual assaults.

00:38:41,249 --> 00:38:42,384
Deescalation.

00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,085
If we can't get
to where he's going,

00:38:44,152 --> 00:38:45,353
we'll go where he's been.

00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,857
Hi. Hi, I'm Nick Stokes.

00:38:48,924 --> 00:38:49,958
I'm with the Vegas crime lab.

00:38:50,025 --> 00:38:51,693
There's a situation
in your apartment complex

00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,428
you should be aware of.

00:38:53,495 --> 00:38:55,597
You mind if I come in,
ask you a few questions?

00:38:55,664 --> 00:38:57,332
Hello.

00:38:57,399 --> 00:38:58,400
I'm Warrick Brown.

00:38:58,466 --> 00:38:59,901
I'm from
the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

00:38:59,968 --> 00:39:01,469
We're investigating
a disturbance

00:39:01,536 --> 00:39:02,470
a couple doors down.

00:39:02,537 --> 00:39:03,471
I wanted to ask you

00:39:03,538 --> 00:39:04,873
a few questions
if I could.

00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,874
So help me out.

00:39:05,941 --> 00:39:08,076
What's a delicate way
to say this?

00:39:08,143 --> 00:39:11,546
I'd like to barge in,
tear your apartment upside down

00:39:11,613 --> 00:39:13,682
look for five-month-old
evidence?

00:39:13,748 --> 00:39:14,849
You're the poet.

00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:16,384
I'm glad you noticed.

00:39:16,451 --> 00:39:18,920
Looks like somebody
is still awake.

00:39:18,987 --> 00:39:20,989
( <i>knocking</i> )

00:39:23,024 --> 00:39:24,659
Las Vegas Police...

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,196
Detective. Ma'am.

00:39:28,263 --> 00:39:29,431
What are you doing here?

00:39:29,497 --> 00:39:31,533
I live here.

00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,002
This is not the address
on your driver's license.

00:39:34,069 --> 00:39:36,004
People move.

00:39:36,071 --> 00:39:37,372
Right.

00:39:37,439 --> 00:39:38,640
We'd like to come in.

00:39:38,707 --> 00:39:39,908
Sure.

00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,445
Pardon the mess.

00:39:54,756 --> 00:39:56,625
I'm going to take
a guess here.

00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:59,728
This apartment came
on the market

00:39:59,794 --> 00:40:01,296
five months ago.

00:40:01,363 --> 00:40:03,798
The old tenant was bothered
by the breaking and entering,

00:40:03,865 --> 00:40:06,701
the bloodstain
that you left behind.

00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:09,428
You moved into the apartment

00:40:09,495 --> 00:40:12,131
you committed
your first crime in, didn't you?

00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:14,943
Now you're ready
to move again, huh?

00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,846
You weren't looking
for another apartment.

00:40:17,912 --> 00:40:20,048
You were looking for...

00:40:23,251 --> 00:40:25,020
another victim.

00:40:27,689 --> 00:40:30,158
You got something to hide, Reed?

00:40:32,327 --> 00:40:33,294
Jim?

00:40:33,361 --> 00:40:34,362
Yeah, okay.

00:40:58,753 --> 00:41:00,755
Jim, we need an ambulance!

00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:05,894
Miss, are you all right?

00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,796
It's over. It's over.
It's okay.

00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,948
The cop read Melissa her rights

00:41:27,015 --> 00:41:29,718
right there
in the hospital room.

00:41:29,784 --> 00:41:31,853
You think you know somebody.

00:41:33,121 --> 00:41:35,190
I never think that.

00:41:35,256 --> 00:41:37,459
Ever?

00:41:41,696 --> 00:41:42,731
When I was a kid

00:41:42,797 --> 00:41:45,200
I was playing hide-
and-seek one day

00:41:45,266 --> 00:41:49,104
and I found this plastic bag
under my big brother's bed.

00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,106
I thought it was
a bag of dirt

00:41:51,172 --> 00:41:52,741
so I took it to my mom.

00:41:52,807 --> 00:41:55,410
Turned out it was
his bag of weed.

00:41:55,477 --> 00:41:58,079
He was grounded
for a year.

00:41:58,146 --> 00:42:02,584
The best intentions
are fraught with disappointment.

00:42:02,884 --> 00:42:05,987
Emerson?

00:42:06,054 --> 00:42:08,352
Grissom.
