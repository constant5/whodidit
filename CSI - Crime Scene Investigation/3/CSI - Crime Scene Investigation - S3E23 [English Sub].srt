We need to get a picture
of this.

These guys

The rest looks like

Whoever did this knew
precisely what they were after.

Well, the one good thing
about their precision...

that we need to start
processing this bank.

00:06:27,736 --> 00:06:29,737
Right.

My guess
is the same stick

they used to cover up
that camera lens,

00:10:19,295 --> 00:10:21,329

He doesn't.

Unless he was juiced in
by Sam Braun.

00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:45,704
All right.

00:12:47,504 --> 00:12:49,138
Where is all of this leading?

00:12:49,205 --> 00:12:50,339
( <i>inhales</i> )

00:12:50,405 --> 00:12:53,340
Well, last year,

00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:55,708
one of your cocktail waitresses
is murdered.

00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,275
Still unsolved.

00:12:59,109 --> 00:13:01,010
She worked at another one
of my hotels--

00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:02,377
the Whiskey Town.

00:13:02,444 --> 00:13:05,044
And this Whiting guy
worked here at the Rampart...

00:13:05,111 --> 00:13:06,578
They're both your hotels....

00:13:06,645 --> 00:13:08,279
How does that look for business?

00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:12,681
Mugs, I got a P.R. department
that deals with that.

00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:15,349
When one white tiger
killed another one

00:13:15,415 --> 00:13:17,783
in the Secret Garden
at the Mirage,

00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,050
the P.R. Department
had it buried

00:13:20,117 --> 00:13:23,519
on page 16E,
under the car ads, about...

00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:24,553
this big.

00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,320
Right. They made it go away.

00:13:27,387 --> 00:13:30,622
Some things
are people's business.

00:13:30,688 --> 00:13:32,489
Some things aren't.

00:13:32,556 --> 00:13:34,390
Well, this is <i>my</i> business.

00:13:34,457 --> 00:13:36,423
It's not going to go away.

00:13:38,124 --> 00:13:40,259
Then I'll be rooting for you.

00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:49,996
BRASS:
Las Vegas Police.

00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:53,197
Manager said he lived alone.

00:14:03,201 --> 00:14:05,002
If this getaway driver's

00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:07,069
stupid enough to get whacked
by his partners,

00:14:07,136 --> 00:14:09,270
he's stupid enough
to leave something behind.

00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:15,872
BRASS:
This whole neighborhood's
stupid.

00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:22,875
Whew.

00:14:24,576 --> 00:14:27,278
Whew.

00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:28,678
Sixty grand a year

00:14:28,745 --> 00:14:30,412
for jockeying cars?

00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:31,979
I'm in the wrong line of work.

00:14:32,046 --> 00:14:34,280
Well, look on the bright side:
you're still alive.

00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,182
BRASS:
Bedroom's a bust.
What do you got?

00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:45,151
I got two $5,000 stacks

00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,318
from the Rampart.

00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,119
Sam Braun's hotel.

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,453
Um, Lockwood's bullet
on the right,

00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,254
and the cop car bullet...

00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:57,255
what's left of that cop car
bullet's on the left.

00:14:57,322 --> 00:15:00,224
Both projectiles with 308s.

00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,324
Consistent with the M1A.

00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:03,791
Long gun.
Mm-hmm.

00:15:03,858 --> 00:15:05,592
And long guns
are only registered

00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:08,194
to the person who makes
the initial purchase...

00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,894
and the serial numbers
aren't recorded.

00:15:10,961 --> 00:15:11,994
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:15,329
Impossible to trace,
so it's a dead end.

00:15:15,396 --> 00:15:18,897
Well, forensically, yeah,
but not cognitively.

00:15:18,964 --> 00:15:20,832
See, shooting someone
from long range,

00:15:20,898 --> 00:15:22,899
and taking out the engine
of a radio car

00:15:22,966 --> 00:15:24,266
while it is hauling ass...

00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,134
You're looking
at one sharp shooter.

00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:29,101
And that kind of training
only comes from...

00:15:29,168 --> 00:15:30,702
The military.

00:15:34,337 --> 00:15:36,338

Almost looks good as new.

00:18:33,908 --> 00:18:36,609
Kind of.

00:18:36,675 --> 00:18:38,609
This was the epitome

00:18:38,676 --> 00:18:39,943
of precision.

00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,745
The outer rim of boxes
sustained the most damage

00:18:42,812 --> 00:18:45,746
The intent was not to blow out
the 23 surrounding boxes,

00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:48,947
but to preserve the sanctity
of the center box.

00:18:49,014 --> 00:18:50,915
Box 729? It's history.

00:18:50,982 --> 00:18:52,482
It's the only thing
that's gone.

00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,849
That's the box
they were after.

00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:58,784
And we still don't know
what was inside.

00:19:06,487 --> 00:19:07,621
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,322
What is up with
the bank manager?

00:19:09,389 --> 00:19:10,823
We've been
waiting forever.

00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:18,359
Hey.

00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:21,860
( <i>muffled</i> ):
How long have we known
each other?

00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,761
In days, months, or years?

00:19:24,828 --> 00:19:26,962
I'm serious here.

00:19:28,496 --> 00:19:30,030
Can you hear me?

00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:31,986
Sorry I'm late.

00:19:34,754 --> 00:19:37,855
Been on the phone all night
with corporate...

00:19:37,922 --> 00:19:40,123
not to mention I had
a gun in my face.

00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,157
So, you want to
know the lessees

00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:44,324
of some of our
safe deposit boxes?

00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,792
Oh, not some,
just one.

00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:47,359
Box 729.

00:19:47,426 --> 00:19:49,160
Why don't you just
hold up a touch?

00:19:49,227 --> 00:19:50,861
I want to help
you, but...

00:19:50,927 --> 00:19:52,594
you're going to have
to give me a court order.

00:19:52,661 --> 00:19:55,429
Oh, no worries.

00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:13,636
Box 729 lessee
is Benny Murdock.

00:20:13,703 --> 00:20:14,903
Benny Murdock?

00:20:17,537 --> 00:20:18,839
You know him?

00:20:18,905 --> 00:20:21,840
Yeah.

00:20:21,906 --> 00:20:24,273
MAN:
<i>Benny.</i>

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,875
He was my first doorman
at the Whiskey Town.

00:20:26,942 --> 00:20:28,042
A year later,

00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:30,843
I made him a casino host
at Pike's Gambling Hall.

00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:34,111
Within six months,
he had all the play

00:20:34,177 --> 00:20:35,778
at the Tangiers.

00:20:35,845 --> 00:20:37,345
( <i>laughs</i> ):
Six months.

00:20:39,046 --> 00:20:41,280
Became my right arm
when we opened the Rampart.

00:20:41,347 --> 00:20:42,714
I never thought

00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:43,948
I would outlive him.

00:20:44,014 --> 00:20:46,149
He died a couple
of weeks ago, right?

00:20:46,216 --> 00:20:49,016
Brain aneurysm.

00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,151
You never know
when you're going to go.

00:20:51,218 --> 00:20:53,486
All those memories...

00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:56,353
Benny, we're going
to have a great summer.

00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,653
( <i>woman giggling</i> )

00:20:59,788 --> 00:21:03,056
Did Larry Whiting... know Benny?

00:21:03,123 --> 00:21:05,656
Everybody who was anybody
knew Benny,

00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,491
including you.

00:21:08,624 --> 00:21:10,126
Informally.

00:21:10,191 --> 00:21:11,292
Informally enough

00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:13,327
for him to direct the high-end
whales your way

00:21:13,394 --> 00:21:14,494
when you were dancing.

00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,527
( <i>laughs</i> ):
Ooh...

00:21:15,594 --> 00:21:16,894
That is

00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:18,362
old Vegas, Sam.

00:21:19,729 --> 00:21:21,696
Sunset on that time.

00:21:24,698 --> 00:21:28,332
I hear you and Benny had
a little sunset of your own.

00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,833
A falling out
about six months ago.

00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,168
WOMAN ON INTERCOM:
Mr. Braun, it's "Bravado"
regarding BJ 19.

00:21:35,235 --> 00:21:37,903
If you will
excuse me,

00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,003
I have to take care of that.

00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,340
Yeah?

00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:49,141
( <i>muffled and echoing</i> ):
Raise the limit,

00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:50,341
and change the cards.

00:21:50,408 --> 00:21:52,042
If he wins three double downs

00:21:52,108 --> 00:21:53,475
in a row, call me back.

00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:55,009
We'll send "Mr. Happy."

00:21:59,412 --> 00:22:01,678
I'm sorry. Where were we?

00:22:01,745 --> 00:22:03,212
Benny.

00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:04,746
Sorry. That's off limits...

00:22:04,813 --> 00:22:06,447
but I was with him
in the hospital

00:22:06,514 --> 00:22:07,681
when he died.

00:22:07,748 --> 00:22:09,815
We made our peace,
if it's for the record.

00:22:09,882 --> 00:22:11,016
You wouldn't happen to know

00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:12,850
what he kept inside
his safe deposit box,

00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,051
would you?

00:22:14,117 --> 00:22:16,052
You'll have to ask him.

00:22:16,118 --> 00:22:17,752
Well, I wish we could.

00:22:17,818 --> 00:22:19,286
If you'll excuse me,

00:22:19,353 --> 00:22:21,853
someone is robbing me
downstairs.

00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:30,891
You know what "off
the record" means,

00:22:30,957 --> 00:22:32,158
don't you, Greg?

00:22:32,224 --> 00:22:34,059
Yeah.

00:22:40,461 --> 00:22:42,429
GRISSOM:
Albert,

00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:43,729
got a minute?

00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:44,896
Sure. What's up?

00:22:44,962 --> 00:22:48,998
I'd like a second opinion.

00:22:49,065 --> 00:22:51,231
Boy, I wish you'd
come to me sooner.

00:22:51,298 --> 00:22:53,933
Your condition's
pretty far along.

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,701
Why did you wait?

00:22:55,767 --> 00:22:57,335
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:22:57,401 --> 00:22:58,668
I hoped it would go away.

00:22:58,735 --> 00:23:00,202
Doesn't your mother

00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:01,903
have this condition?

00:23:01,969 --> 00:23:04,170
Yeah. It's hereditary.

00:23:04,236 --> 00:23:05,937
I know.

00:23:06,004 --> 00:23:08,405
I wasn't rational.

00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:09,706
( <i>laughs</i> )

00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:11,807
Look, Gil, I'm not going
to preach to you.

00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:13,940
You came to me, but...
doctor to doctor...

00:23:14,007 --> 00:23:16,275
there's a chance
the bone deposits have spread

00:23:16,342 --> 00:23:18,443
into the inner ear,
in which case,

00:23:18,509 --> 00:23:21,477
your hearing loss
will eventually
be permanent.

00:23:22,477 --> 00:23:23,978
If I were you,

00:23:24,044 --> 00:23:26,612
I'd schedule surgery
as soon as possible.

00:23:28,946 --> 00:23:31,147
SANDERS:
You know the eyelash
Warrick found

00:23:31,214 --> 00:23:33,549
embedded in the black
greasepaint--

00:23:33,615 --> 00:23:35,482
I extracted the DNA, ran it.

00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:38,417
CODIS gave me a, uh,

00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:39,584
Mongolian beef.

00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:40,851
I'm sorry.
What does that mean?

00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:42,218
That means he got nothing.

00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:43,685
There, try these, big guy.

00:23:43,752 --> 00:23:44,686
Training wheels.

00:23:44,753 --> 00:23:45,686
Thanks.

00:23:45,753 --> 00:23:46,687
STOKES:
Hey, guys, guys,

00:23:46,754 --> 00:23:48,121
let's focus
on the robbers.

00:23:48,188 --> 00:23:49,054
Grissom?

00:23:50,288 --> 00:23:51,723
What do you think?

00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:54,490
I think we're giving these guys
too much credit.

00:23:54,557 --> 00:23:56,391
They're experts
at robbing banks,

00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,425
not experts
at concealing evidence.

00:23:58,491 --> 00:24:01,526
Well, unless the answer's
in that fortune cookie,

00:24:01,593 --> 00:24:03,593
what's the plan?

00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,594
Do you ever wonder

00:24:04,661 --> 00:24:06,295
how the fortune
gets inside the cookie?

00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:07,862
I know.

00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:09,129
Of course you do.

00:24:09,196 --> 00:24:11,696
The cookie comes out of a press,
like a tortilla,

00:24:11,763 --> 00:24:13,564
and then some lady puts
the fortune

00:24:13,631 --> 00:24:15,031
in the center of the dough,

00:24:15,098 --> 00:24:17,633
and then folds the dough
around a piece of metal,

00:24:17,699 --> 00:24:19,000
and then folds it again.

00:24:20,033 --> 00:24:21,934
That's the answer.

00:25:01,983 --> 00:25:04,151
( <i>beeping</i> )

Non-gaming.

He's in the
hotel business.

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,420
Rampart.

00:25:11,487 --> 00:25:13,221
Hey, didn't that other guy
work at the...

00:25:13,288 --> 00:25:14,888
Run him through the
military database.

00:25:14,955 --> 00:25:16,222
Why?
Just run it.

00:25:17,623 --> 00:25:20,658
After that, give us an address.

00:25:35,896 --> 00:25:37,031
All clear.

00:25:37,097 --> 00:25:38,765
It's all yours, boss.

00:25:44,266 --> 00:25:45,800
Come on.
Let's see what's cooking.

00:25:48,335 --> 00:25:50,336
Whoo!

00:25:51,736 --> 00:25:53,270
WILLOWS:
Oh, well,

00:25:53,337 --> 00:25:55,104
that is... one example

00:25:55,171 --> 00:25:56,738
of the evidence going up
in smoke.

00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,606
This guy's a piece
of work, huh?

00:25:58,673 --> 00:26:00,273
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,340
( <i>metal clanging</i> )

00:26:07,876 --> 00:26:11,978
One of the black
coats, you think?

00:26:20,014 --> 00:26:23,616
Box 729.

00:26:27,217 --> 00:26:29,851
Fire-resistant.

00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:35,687
It's some kind of fabric.
Silk, maybe.

00:26:35,753 --> 00:26:37,354
What do you make of that?

00:26:37,421 --> 00:26:39,856
Out of context,
I don't know.

00:26:53,061 --> 00:26:55,628

Pink Panther.

00:27:01,897 --> 00:27:03,564
Well, Clouseau,

00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:06,499
how does blood get
in a safe deposit box?

00:27:06,566 --> 00:27:08,933
Maybe has something to do
with this fabric.

00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,268
Mr. Nine Volt, Rob Rubio--

00:27:11,335 --> 00:27:14,503
ex-military,
security expert.

00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:16,237
Went to work for casino owner
Sam Braun

00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:18,270
when one of his soft count
cronies got caught

00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:19,471
skimming the skim,

00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:21,872
so... all roads
lead to Rome, except,

00:27:21,938 --> 00:27:24,073
in this case... the Rampart.

00:28:09,957 --> 00:28:10,892
( <i>camera clicking</i> )

00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:12,526
Triple homicide
in the desert.

00:28:12,592 --> 00:28:14,392
Old-time Vegas.

00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,126
We found Tommy "The Aspirin"
out here.

00:28:16,193 --> 00:28:17,294
Remember him?

00:28:17,361 --> 00:28:19,294
Used to make his boss'
headaches disappear.

00:28:19,361 --> 00:28:20,995
Until they made him disappear.

00:28:21,061 --> 00:28:23,663
I think this is the origin
of the word "termination."

00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,097
There's the
corporate way,

00:28:25,164 --> 00:28:26,397
and the way
of the gun.

00:28:26,464 --> 00:28:28,031
High-powered rifle.

00:28:28,098 --> 00:28:29,331
Close range.

00:28:29,398 --> 00:28:30,899
Visible gunpowder.

00:28:30,965 --> 00:28:32,200
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,201
This guy got it
in the chest, too.

00:28:36,268 --> 00:28:37,169
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:28:37,235 --> 00:28:39,202
And this one took it
in the back.

00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:41,136
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:28:41,203 --> 00:28:43,504
This one's carrying a Glock.

00:28:43,571 --> 00:28:44,838
Never got a chance to use it.

00:28:44,905 --> 00:28:46,005
WILLOWS:
Well, all three

00:28:46,071 --> 00:28:47,939
were carrying,
so they're not tied up,

00:28:48,006 --> 00:28:49,206
and they're still armed.

00:28:49,273 --> 00:28:50,840
They didn't fly here.

00:28:50,907 --> 00:28:52,275
Where's their car?

00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,875
It's not a dump job.

00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:56,142
Killer drove them here,

00:28:56,209 --> 00:28:58,210
killed them, and drove away.

00:28:58,277 --> 00:28:59,844
BRASS:
They knew
their attacker.

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,580
Never let a man
do a woman's job.

00:29:07,647 --> 00:29:08,814
What do you mean?

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,048
They didn't get
all their makeup off.

00:29:12,882 --> 00:29:14,082
BRASS:
Where's he going?

00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:15,416
WILLOWS:
Let's just hope

00:29:15,483 --> 00:29:17,284
he stops.

00:29:27,154 --> 00:29:29,189
Look familiar?

00:29:29,255 --> 00:29:33,191
WILLOWS:
Bloodstain.

00:29:33,257 --> 00:29:35,058
Rainbow-colored thread.

00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:36,292
Safe deposit box.

00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,326
Those guys are definitely
the bank robbers.

00:29:38,393 --> 00:29:39,660
Where's the fourth guy?

00:29:39,726 --> 00:29:41,927
The guy who's rapidly becoming
a mass murderer.

00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:43,928
Rob Rubio.

00:29:50,263 --> 00:29:51,764
Grissom, hey.

00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,398
Grissom, hey,
just tested the bullets

00:29:53,465 --> 00:29:54,699
from your trio in the desert.

00:29:54,766 --> 00:29:56,966
( <i>muffled</i> ):
Same GRCs as the bullet
from Lockwood.

00:29:57,033 --> 00:29:58,167
Fired from the same rifle.

00:29:58,234 --> 00:29:59,701
Slow down, Bobby.

00:29:59,768 --> 00:30:01,469
I'm sorry.
I just got excited.

00:30:01,535 --> 00:30:04,069
You don't get to see
many .30-caliber rounds

00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,737
used in crimes, but, uh...

00:30:09,605 --> 00:30:10,739
( <i>door banging open</i> )

00:30:10,805 --> 00:30:11,905
You rang?

00:30:11,972 --> 00:30:13,073
Uh, yeah.

00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,707
The, uh, blood flecks
from the safe deposit box--

00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:17,108
two distinct samples.

00:30:17,174 --> 00:30:18,508
I only got one hit, though.

00:30:18,575 --> 00:30:21,776
Uh, the primary sample
belongs to Vivian Verona,

00:30:21,843 --> 00:30:23,077
a cocktail waitress.

00:30:23,143 --> 00:30:24,377
She was killed
on the top floor

00:30:24,444 --> 00:30:25,711
of the old
Pike's Gambling Hall

00:30:25,778 --> 00:30:26,778
about two years ago.

00:30:26,845 --> 00:30:28,712
Here's the report.

00:30:28,779 --> 00:30:30,880
Multiple
puncture wounds,

00:30:30,947 --> 00:30:35,115
different depths,
possibly two knives...

00:30:35,181 --> 00:30:39,016
I've pulled the crime scene
photos for you, too.

00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,317
Case still pending.

00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,451
Murder weapon was never found.

00:30:42,518 --> 00:30:44,419
Now, the secondary blood
sample came back N.D.

00:30:44,486 --> 00:30:46,053
Uh, could be the killer.

00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,553
You always say murder's messy.

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,788
Greg, your hands are shaking.

00:30:51,855 --> 00:30:53,489
No, they're not.

00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:01,058
Hold your hands out.

00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,259
Uh...

00:31:03,326 --> 00:31:07,061
they've been shaking
ever since...

00:31:12,596 --> 00:31:14,597
I can't really make it stop.

00:31:14,663 --> 00:31:15,865
Is it affecting your work?

00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,499
Well, if I was
a bomb expert, maybe.

00:31:19,832 --> 00:31:21,233
No, I...

00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:23,634
I think I have it under control.

00:31:23,701 --> 00:31:26,635
It'll stop.

00:31:26,702 --> 00:31:28,703
If you need me, I'll be around.

00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,870
Okay.

00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,014
I have your scarf
back from Sanders.

00:32:03,949 --> 00:32:06,217
I need you to open
this evidence bag

00:32:06,284 --> 00:32:08,951
and cut me
an identical piece of fabric.

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,520
You want me to replicate
the blood pattern?

00:32:12,586 --> 00:32:13,820
Yeah.

00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,491
You guys need a hand?

00:32:25,025 --> 00:32:28,026
Warrick, hand me those scissors.

00:32:30,794 --> 00:32:33,062
Nick, give me that apple.

00:32:33,128 --> 00:32:35,262
But I didn't get any lunch.

00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:36,463
Give me
the apple.

00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,097
You're not supposed
to eat in here.

00:32:43,765 --> 00:32:46,500
Two puncture wounds, right?

00:32:55,904 --> 00:32:57,571
Scissors.

00:32:57,638 --> 00:33:00,272
That's what was wrapped
in the scarf.

00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,074
BROWN:
These don't look like

00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,874
your ordinary household pair.

00:33:05,941 --> 00:33:07,809
STOKES:
No, man, look
at the blades.

00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:09,909
They're almost double
the size of the handles.

00:33:09,976 --> 00:33:12,677
What's the purpose
of scissors that long?

00:33:12,744 --> 00:33:13,911
Murder.

00:33:13,978 --> 00:33:17,346
I hear scissors, I hear murder.
What did I miss?

00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,413
We may have the murder weapon.

00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,981
SIDLE:
Hey, Vivian Verona

00:33:21,047 --> 00:33:22,481
worked for Sam Braun--
a cocktail waitress

00:33:22,548 --> 00:33:24,349
at Pike's
Gambling Hall.

00:33:24,415 --> 00:33:26,016
Murdered the night before
it was imploded

00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:27,016
in a penthouse suite.

00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,550
Sounds like somebody wanted her

00:33:28,617 --> 00:33:29,917
to disappear in the rubble.

00:33:29,984 --> 00:33:33,018
Bet you Braun hired his own
clean-up crew for that one.

00:33:33,085 --> 00:33:34,852
SIDLE:
The pyro guys
found her on their

00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:35,853
last walk-through.

00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,087
They assigned a CSI,

00:33:37,153 --> 00:33:38,854
but the case ran cold
before it even got started.

00:33:38,921 --> 00:33:40,622
There was no suspect
and no motive.

00:33:40,688 --> 00:33:41,822
Warrick,

00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,589
enhance the blade area.

00:33:49,891 --> 00:33:51,525
BROWN:
Hmm, let me see
if I can flip it around

00:33:51,592 --> 00:33:54,160
so we're not looking
at an eye chart.

00:33:54,227 --> 00:33:58,462
GRISSOM:
R-P-R-T.

00:33:59,695 --> 00:34:01,463
Rampart.

00:34:05,131 --> 00:34:06,865
WILLOWS:
He's not returning
any of my phone calls.

00:34:06,932 --> 00:34:09,033
I just need to confront
this Sam Braun business

00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,667
once and for all.

00:34:10,734 --> 00:34:12,201
I'll drive.

00:34:13,234 --> 00:34:15,269
I'm not going with you.

00:34:15,335 --> 00:34:16,902
What do you mean?

00:34:19,336 --> 00:34:22,071
I'm scheduled for surgery
at Desert Palm.

00:34:24,672 --> 00:34:26,539
Surgery?

00:34:34,576 --> 00:34:36,110
Your hearing?

00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:38,511
Yep.

00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:42,612
I'm sorry.

00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:46,047
I'm not. Has to be done.

00:34:46,114 --> 00:34:47,881
What can I do?

00:34:47,948 --> 00:34:50,582
Nothing. I'm fine.

00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:52,249
Take care of the case.

00:34:52,316 --> 00:34:53,717
Oh, eh, mm...

00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,585
That's it?

00:34:56,652 --> 00:34:58,952
That's it.

00:34:59,019 --> 00:35:02,253
Um...

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,787
good luck.

00:35:28,331 --> 00:35:30,998
You must really like
the ham steak at the Primm.

00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,567
One more mile north--
you're gone forever.

00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,701
They got good ham.

00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:39,969
That's good to know.

00:35:40,035 --> 00:35:42,703
I'll know what to get you
for your last meal...

00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:44,737
for killing a cop.

00:35:44,804 --> 00:35:48,039
You know the rifle
we found in your trunk?

00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:50,639
The bullets match one we pulled
out of a friend of mine--

00:35:50,706 --> 00:35:52,874
Detective Cyrus Lockwood.

00:35:52,941 --> 00:35:56,209
Tough losing one of your own.

00:35:56,275 --> 00:35:57,876
You lost three of yours.

00:35:57,943 --> 00:36:00,343
Ballistics made
a match there, too.

00:36:03,611 --> 00:36:05,145
So, you're ex-military.

00:36:05,212 --> 00:36:06,512
That why Sam Braun
hired you

00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:08,413
to be head of security
at the Rampart?

00:36:08,479 --> 00:36:10,914
You asking me,
or you telling me?

00:36:10,981 --> 00:36:12,415
I'm telling you.

00:36:12,481 --> 00:36:15,549
My guess is Sam needed
a job done, he came to you.

00:36:15,616 --> 00:36:17,951
You know,
when I get out of here,

00:36:18,016 --> 00:36:22,419
I'm going to take pleasure
in putting air in your head.

00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,721
Let me put a fact in yours.

00:36:28,788 --> 00:36:31,255
You left a lot of yourself
behind, killer.

00:36:33,756 --> 00:36:36,791
( <i>gunshots</i> )

00:36:42,926 --> 00:36:44,994
So, here's the deal.

00:36:45,061 --> 00:36:46,828
You give up your boss,

00:36:46,895 --> 00:36:49,395
you get to spend the rest
of your life in a jail cell,

00:36:49,462 --> 00:36:50,964
not on Death Row.

00:36:51,029 --> 00:36:52,598
I'll take Death Row.

00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:56,799
I'll live longer.

00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:07,403
WILLOWS:
Tangiers,
Pike's Gambling Hall...

00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,004
Where are
the Rampart scissors, Sam?

00:37:09,071 --> 00:37:11,505
I think they went to one
of those silent auctions.

00:37:11,571 --> 00:37:13,139
You know, the kind
where you put a number down

00:37:13,205 --> 00:37:14,639
and remain anonymous.

00:37:14,706 --> 00:37:15,739
Uh-huh.

00:37:15,806 --> 00:37:17,707
I'm sure they went
to a good cause.

00:37:17,773 --> 00:37:20,242
How much money they make?

00:37:20,308 --> 00:37:23,243
More than
I anticipated.

00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:26,777
I think that we're past
playing games, Sam.

00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:30,379
I need the truth.

00:37:30,446 --> 00:37:31,913
You sure about that?

00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,447
Oh, yeah.

00:37:33,514 --> 00:37:35,914
Now more than ever.

00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,383
Benny killed Vivian.

00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:45,352
He caught her
cheating on him...

00:37:45,418 --> 00:37:47,585
with me.

00:37:48,653 --> 00:37:50,586
( <i>gasps</i> )

00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:52,954
I can explain.

00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:56,189
When I heard he was dying,
I went to see him.

00:37:56,256 --> 00:37:58,157
He told me he killed her
with my scissors

00:37:58,223 --> 00:37:59,457
from a ribbon-cutting ceremony.

00:37:59,524 --> 00:38:02,191
He always kept
the scissors--

00:38:02,258 --> 00:38:04,425
had them shadow-boxed for me.

00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,528
He stashed them
in the safe deposit box.

00:38:10,594 --> 00:38:12,896
Why would Benny do that?

00:38:12,962 --> 00:38:15,329
Why would Benny murder Vivian

00:38:15,396 --> 00:38:18,031
and then keep
the incriminating evidence,

00:38:18,098 --> 00:38:20,899
not even attempt
to wash off the blood?

00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,533
You're asking me
to answer on his behalf?

00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,034
I don't know.

00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:27,935
Maybe he was
paranoid.

00:38:28,002 --> 00:38:30,269
Figured you would
drag Lake Mead.

00:38:30,335 --> 00:38:31,570
Let me just get this straight.

00:38:31,637 --> 00:38:36,105
To protect Benny
after he's already dead,

00:38:36,172 --> 00:38:39,072
you hire Rob Rubio

00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:43,074
and three cronies to commit
federal bank robbery

00:38:43,141 --> 00:38:45,875
to steal back
a pair of scissors?

00:38:45,942 --> 00:38:48,476
They weren't just
any pair of scissors.

00:38:48,543 --> 00:38:52,845
They were tied to a legacy.

00:38:52,912 --> 00:38:56,813
If Benny goes down, I go down.

00:38:56,879 --> 00:39:00,981
40 years...

00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:04,283
building a reputation-- gone.

00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:05,783
Games are meant

00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:09,251
to be played downstairs,
not upstairs...

00:39:09,318 --> 00:39:12,952
so I ask Rob to take care of it.

00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:22,256
We have the safe deposit box
in our possession, Sam,

00:39:22,323 --> 00:39:24,557
along with
the bloodstained sash

00:39:24,623 --> 00:39:26,591
the scissors
were wrapped in.

00:39:26,658 --> 00:39:30,793
We recovered two
different blood samples--

00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:34,627
one belonging to Vivian,
and the other unknown.

00:39:34,694 --> 00:39:40,397
I guess I didn't have a good
enough reason until now, but...

00:39:40,464 --> 00:39:42,465
I tested my DNA

00:39:42,531 --> 00:39:47,933
against the unknown
sample.

00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:49,500
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:52,568
And wouldn't you know...

00:39:52,634 --> 00:39:57,870
there were
seven alleles in common.

00:40:02,739 --> 00:40:05,240
That supposed to mean something?

00:40:05,307 --> 00:40:10,142
It means that you and I
are biologically related.

00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:15,977
You killed her, Sam...

00:40:16,044 --> 00:40:20,979
and Benny covered for you.

00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:28,750
Part of the old
double standard.

00:40:28,816 --> 00:40:30,549
No woman that you're with

00:40:30,616 --> 00:40:33,284
is <i>ever</i> going to be
with another man.

00:40:39,653 --> 00:40:43,522
I swear on your mother...

00:40:43,589 --> 00:40:45,756
it didn't happen that way.

00:40:45,822 --> 00:40:48,057
Oh, now, that holds
a lot of weight.

00:40:48,124 --> 00:40:52,959
To this day my mother still sits
at home waiting for your call.

00:40:57,927 --> 00:41:02,429
Do you really think
I could murder someone?

00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:05,697
Science...

00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:07,598
tells me that you did.

00:41:10,866 --> 00:41:13,500
So, yes, I do.

00:41:17,669 --> 00:41:21,703
It's just such a lousy way to
find out that you're my father.

00:41:33,675 --> 00:41:36,443
They're preparing the surgery
right now, Mr. Grissom.

00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,743
They'll be ready
for you in moments.

00:41:47,447 --> 00:41:48,981
WILLOWS:
Hey.

00:41:50,548 --> 00:41:51,985
What are you doing here?

00:41:52,052 --> 00:41:55,155
I just wanted
to see you.

00:41:55,221 --> 00:42:00,360
And I didn't want you to go in
without wishing you good luck.

00:42:10,904 --> 00:42:13,473
Thank you.

00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,743
For being here.

00:42:28,622 --> 00:42:30,724
I don't need that.

00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:34,661



00:42:34,728 --> 00:42:38,098
and Volkswagen.


00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:45,038
