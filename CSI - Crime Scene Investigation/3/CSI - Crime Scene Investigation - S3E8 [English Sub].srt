But this, this one
just felt different.

00:01:19,608 --> 00:01:22,178
Yeah, it should.

00:01:22,244 --> 00:01:24,046

to be developed
in the past?

00:02:13,212 --> 00:02:14,613
I'm sure he has.

00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,283
We get raw film
from hundreds of
adult film companies.

00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,086
No names, just
those private boxes.

00:02:21,153 --> 00:02:25,090
You can film porn, develop it,
sell it, buy it

but you can't send it
through the U.S. mail.

00:02:27,693 --> 00:02:29,661
I've got several envelopes here

00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:32,264
from various
private shipping companies.

00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:34,967
We'll be taking those with us
as well.

It's Brass.

00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,942
I got a d.b. out
on Henderson Road.

I'm already on a case.

00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,111
Yeah, well, reconsider.

00:02:46,178 --> 00:02:48,013
I mean, these ants came flying
out of the body.

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,715
They're taking chunks
out of the coroner.

00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:52,150
The CSI day guy says he's not
going near the body again!

00:02:52,217 --> 00:02:53,585
They're fire ants, Brass.

00:02:53,652 --> 00:02:55,587
Keep everyone away
from the colony.

00:02:55,654 --> 00:02:56,588
They're evidence.

00:02:56,655 --> 00:02:57,723
Reconsider.

00:02:57,789 --> 00:02:58,924
Bring bug spray.

00:02:58,991 --> 00:03:00,893
No bug spray.

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,928
BRASS:
So a kid was driving along

00:03:02,995 --> 00:03:04,263
and spotted
the tool box.

00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:06,965
He thought it would
look good in
his pickup truck.

00:03:07,032 --> 00:03:08,634
So he looked inside
and freaked out.

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,002
Ran to call for help.

00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:11,703
Hey... Grissom

00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,305
you ever see anything
like this?

00:03:13,372 --> 00:03:14,840

Well, any species
that finds itself

00:03:14,907 --> 00:03:16,108
in a place it
doesn't belong

00:03:16,174 --> 00:03:17,342
can do this kind
of damage.

00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:18,343
What are you using?

00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,778
Cortisone.
That'll help.

00:03:19,845 --> 00:03:22,748
You know, I heard
that these things
can kill a deer.

00:03:22,814 --> 00:03:24,183
Is that...
Is that right?

00:03:24,249 --> 00:03:27,920
Well, with enough colonies
they can kill people.

00:03:27,986 --> 00:03:30,255
What about
our person?

00:03:30,322 --> 00:03:33,458
Well, only if they also learned
how to put him in a box

00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:34,960
and dump him in a ditch.

Ant hill.

00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:50,442
They're using this body
as a colony site.

00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:52,578
I'm going to have
to take this box

00:03:52,644 --> 00:03:55,047
and the specimen back to the lab
as is.

00:03:55,113 --> 00:03:57,482
These insects are evidence.

00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:00,986
I followed up on the
private mail depot
for our snuff movie.

00:04:01,053 --> 00:04:02,988
The place has got
over 1,000 boxes

00:04:03,055 --> 00:04:04,590
no records of renters

00:04:04,656 --> 00:04:05,991
and they deal
in cash only.

Dead trail.
Yeah.

Imaging components

Same stuff

but they're smudged.

00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:30,048
I can tell you
that the film was
manufactured in 2002

00:04:30,115 --> 00:04:31,483
by a big company.

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,519
Homicide's contacting them
now to get a buyer's list.

00:04:33,585 --> 00:04:34,887
Won't help.

00:04:34,953 --> 00:04:37,789
Pornos buy "short ends" from
legitimate clearing houses.

00:04:37,856 --> 00:04:40,759
Saves money and they're
impossible to trace.

00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:42,194
Really?

00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:44,930
I pulled a porno ring
using teenage girls
a couple years ago.

00:04:44,997 --> 00:04:46,265
Learned all you want to know

00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:48,166
about the adult
entertainment industry.

00:04:49,935 --> 00:04:52,504
Hell of a way to go.

00:04:53,572 --> 00:04:55,941
I always thought
that snuff films
were an urban myth

00:04:56,008 --> 00:04:58,577
I mean, outside
of urban Bangkok.

00:04:58,644 --> 00:05:01,413
FBI's official position on
snuff films in the U.S. of A?

00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,781
No such thing.

00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:04,883
What's their
unofficial position?

00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,787
Single film goes
for 100 grand...
original negative.

00:05:08,854 --> 00:05:10,889
And this snuff filmmaker

00:05:10,956 --> 00:05:14,693
decided to send his film
out to get processed.

00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,563

00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,276
Yeah? I put them
on my eggs.

00:05:31,343 --> 00:05:33,812

I hope.

Something tells me

00:05:47,059 --> 00:05:48,927
that isn't Black Flag.

00:05:48,994 --> 00:05:52,231
Ecozone Pyrethrum.

00:05:52,297 --> 00:05:56,235
Toxic to ants, fleas

00:05:56,301 --> 00:05:58,670
roaches
and silverfish.

00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:00,839
And how does
an entomologist feel

00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:02,774
about putting ants to death?

00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:05,944
I view them as martyrs
in a scientist's holy war.

00:06:06,011 --> 00:06:08,113
I see.

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,114
Man without a face.

00:06:09,181 --> 00:06:10,816
Timeline for death?

00:06:10,883 --> 00:06:11,984
Hard to say between

00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,919
the insects and the elements.

00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:15,754
At least a year.

00:06:15,821 --> 00:06:17,756
It smells more like two.

00:06:17,823 --> 00:06:20,459
Multiple fractures
of both clavicles.

00:06:20,526 --> 00:06:26,064
Right clavicle healed...
broken four months before death.

00:06:26,131 --> 00:06:27,766
Left was more recent...

00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,536
hairline fractures
are still present.

00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:32,437
Give me a hand turning him over,
will you?

00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:40,946
What are these?

00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:42,247
I'm not sure.

00:06:42,314 --> 00:06:44,149
Sharp impact wounds

00:06:44,216 --> 00:06:46,952
to the interscapular.

00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:48,020
Same trauma here

00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:49,655
in the vertebrel.

00:06:49,721 --> 00:06:51,156
Stab wounds?

00:06:51,223 --> 00:06:53,192
I can't say.

00:06:53,258 --> 00:06:57,229
Uh, maybe some round weapon
of some sort.

00:06:57,296 --> 00:07:00,032
What, two feet apart?

00:07:00,098 --> 00:07:02,000
More like 18 inches.

00:07:10,842 --> 00:07:12,978
What?

00:07:14,913 --> 00:07:16,582
A pupa case.

00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,219
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

00:07:20,285 --> 00:07:21,854
It's a good thing.

00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,622
If I can postdate the pupa

00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:26,491
I can establish
an entomological timeline.

00:07:26,558 --> 00:07:29,261
Okay, all right,
let's run this back again
from the beginning.

00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:32,264
This time
without the sound.

00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:36,702
All right.

00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,172
Stop.

00:07:41,907 --> 00:07:44,109
Can you zoom in on his back?

00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:49,281
What is that?

00:07:49,348 --> 00:07:51,049
A mole?

00:07:51,116 --> 00:07:53,085
Non-cancerous.

00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:54,486
You think?

00:07:54,553 --> 00:07:55,521
Too bad, the bastard.

00:07:55,587 --> 00:07:57,756
This room is like
a dime a dozen

00:07:57,823 --> 00:07:59,892
It could be
anywhere in Vegas.

00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,827
Between the drapes

00:08:01,894 --> 00:08:06,231
can you get any other detail
outside of that window?

00:08:06,298 --> 00:08:07,266
Uh...

00:08:07,332 --> 00:08:09,735
I'll reverse the polarization

00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:11,570
see if we can get any more
information from this frame.

00:08:11,637 --> 00:08:13,772
That looks
like a blob

00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,340
outside of the window.

00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:17,109
It's spherical.

00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:18,644
Blow it up.

00:08:21,146 --> 00:08:23,081
Times ten.

00:08:23,148 --> 00:08:25,384
The Stratosphere Tower.

00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,553
South face maybe?

00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:30,088
Using that Stratosphere Tower
as a point of reference

00:08:30,155 --> 00:08:31,156
could you triangulate

00:08:31,223 --> 00:08:33,625
and pinpoint the street
that this was filmed on?

00:08:33,692 --> 00:08:35,661
I can.

00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:43,435
SULIK:
Hotel's in receivership.

00:08:43,502 --> 00:08:45,971
The security guy says
the elevator still works.

00:08:46,038 --> 00:08:47,706
BROWN:
We're going to need
to talk to him.

00:08:47,773 --> 00:08:50,509
Soon as he gets off the phone
with the owner.

00:09:01,887 --> 00:09:02,921
What's up?

00:09:02,988 --> 00:09:04,656
Oh, nothing.

00:09:04,723 --> 00:09:07,092
Only difference between kitsch
and beautiful

00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,627
is time.

00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:17,402
SANDERS:
Heard you're doing a
timeline on the ant man.

00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:19,838
Slow day in DNA, Greg?

00:09:19,905 --> 00:09:22,140
Yeah.

00:09:22,207 --> 00:09:25,611
You know, I, uh...
I can take notes.

00:09:25,677 --> 00:09:29,915
Very good.
Go right ahead.

00:09:29,982 --> 00:09:35,120
Week zero: body dies.

00:09:35,187 --> 00:09:40,826
Week two:
green blowflies arrive...

00:09:40,893 --> 00:09:46,331
and leave
their pupal casings.

00:09:46,398 --> 00:09:52,237
Week four: black soldier flies
move in.

00:09:52,304 --> 00:09:58,710
At week 28... they leave
their pupa casings.

00:09:58,777 --> 00:10:03,982
Now, the presence of winged
reproductive fire ants

00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:05,951
suggests that their colony

00:10:06,018 --> 00:10:08,820
was in existence
for at least a year.

00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,260
Now, since we found
no more pupa casings

00:10:15,327 --> 00:10:18,096
after the black soldier flies
left at week 28

00:10:18,163 --> 00:10:22,034
we know that this is when
the fire ants must've
first arrived.

00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,670
So, calculating
the gestation period

00:10:24,736 --> 00:10:27,272
between ants and flies,
we get...

00:10:30,442 --> 00:10:33,712
One year plus the 28 weeks...

00:10:35,814 --> 00:10:37,716
the guy's been dead 19 months.

00:10:38,717 --> 00:10:40,385
Very good.

00:10:40,452 --> 00:10:43,455
It's an approximation,
but it's a start.

00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:53,932
Well... Sara,
you take that one.

00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:56,969
Warrick, you go there,
I'll go in here.

00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,706
Hey, guys?

00:11:36,742 --> 00:11:38,810
We got it.

00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:45,384
Somebody moved out
all the furniture.

00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,953
And painted the wall.

00:11:53,892 --> 00:11:57,763
If they can't see it,
we can't, huh?

00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,115
Arterial spray.

00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:22,554
There's a void.

00:12:22,621 --> 00:12:25,490
Could be a face?

00:12:25,557 --> 00:12:28,227
WILLOWS:
Yeah, maybe.

00:12:28,293 --> 00:12:29,595
How does somebody cross the line

00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:32,164
where killing a woman
is a turn-on?

00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:34,700
Oh, I don't think snuff makers
cross a line, Sara.

00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:36,835
I think they start
on the other side of it.

00:12:36,902 --> 00:12:39,838
Biology determining pathology.

00:12:39,905 --> 00:12:42,207
Yeah, some people
were just born bad.

00:12:42,274 --> 00:12:43,842
Where's that security guard?

00:12:49,982 --> 00:12:51,717
SULIK:
How long you been
a day guard here?

00:12:51,783 --> 00:12:53,051
Four months.

00:12:53,118 --> 00:12:54,920
But I don't know anything
about this murder

00:12:54,987 --> 00:12:56,488
you're talking about.

00:12:56,555 --> 00:12:59,057
Do you anything about
who painted Room 918?

00:12:59,124 --> 00:13:00,726
No idea.

00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:02,594
You should try
a scalp conditioner.

00:13:02,661 --> 00:13:04,062
What?
Your dandruff.

00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:08,333
Oh, my bad... primer.

00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,037
Alkyd-based.

00:13:12,104 --> 00:13:13,338
Never comes out
in the wash

00:13:13,405 --> 00:13:16,642
but you already
know that.

00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,010
Warrick?

00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:26,685
You were in that snuff film.

00:13:26,752 --> 00:13:27,953
You stabbed that girl.

00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,188
I let them use the room

00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:30,689
to make a movie,
that's all.

00:13:30,756 --> 00:13:32,191
Yeah, we saw you
in the movie.

00:13:32,257 --> 00:13:33,725
You and your nice mole.

00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:36,762
The guy threw in another $200
if I had sex with the girl.

00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:39,064
She was hot,
so I figured why not?

00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:40,265
Did her and left.

00:13:40,332 --> 00:13:42,301
She was breathing fine.

00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:43,735
So when you came back
in the room

00:13:43,802 --> 00:13:45,170
and you saw the blood
on the wall

00:13:45,237 --> 00:13:46,872
did you think
to call the police?

00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:49,708
I didn't want
to lose my job.

00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:51,476
Oh, touching.

00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:53,111
Arrest him.

00:13:53,178 --> 00:13:54,413
Turn around.

00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:06,417
I see you're now learning
to cook for yourself.

00:14:08,512 --> 00:14:09,580
Well, I had to, Teri

00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:11,415
I heard you
were married.

00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:12,850
Hopefully not
to a criminalist.

00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:14,852
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
You think I'm stupid?

00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,454
He's a teacher.

00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,189
Well, congratulations.

00:14:18,255 --> 00:14:20,157
Thank you.

00:14:20,224 --> 00:14:21,959
So what's the special occasion?

00:14:22,026 --> 00:14:25,262
I have someone I'd like you
to introduce me to.

00:14:30,568 --> 00:14:32,636
What, did I miss something?

00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:36,140
Actually, yes.

00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:37,675
( <i>forceps clang</i> )

00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:46,650
It's a dung beetle.

00:14:46,717 --> 00:14:48,686
Probably hid
in the nasal cavity.

00:14:48,753 --> 00:14:50,721
The ants ate everything
but the exoskeleton.

00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:51,856
Mm-hmm.

00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:53,991
So he was probably
murdered

00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:55,993
near some large animals.

00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,929
Maybe a farm or a zoo.

00:14:58,996 --> 00:15:03,668
Anyway, as to who,
I'll leave that up to you.

00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:05,536
Will do.

00:15:26,057 --> 00:15:28,759
Damn, security guard
was telling the truth.

00:15:28,826 --> 00:15:29,894
There is another guy there.

00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,962
He's almost
one and three-quarter inches

00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:34,398
taller than the security guard.

00:15:34,465 --> 00:15:37,068
Our minds must've filled
in the negative space.

00:15:37,134 --> 00:15:39,337
Look, the security guard
just left the room.

00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:40,638
You see the door shadow
right there.

00:15:44,108 --> 00:15:45,910
The camera stopped moving.

00:15:45,976 --> 00:15:48,813
That's because he's not
behind it, he's in front of it.

00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:51,749
Well, then, that's our guy.

00:15:51,816 --> 00:15:53,484
There's got to be
some way to I.D. him.

00:15:53,551 --> 00:15:56,320
I have enlarged
and re-enlarged every frame.

00:15:56,387 --> 00:15:59,390
There's no tats,
there's no birthmarks, nothing.

00:15:59,457 --> 00:16:00,958
What about the rest of the room?

00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:03,661
The film picks up everything
there is to see, Catherine.

00:16:03,728 --> 00:16:04,895
We've seen everything.

00:16:04,962 --> 00:16:07,431
Maybe there's a short end.

00:16:07,498 --> 00:16:08,632
What?

00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,134
Pornos use short ends of film

00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:12,803
which means they never know when
the film is going to run out.

00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,904
Roll out.

00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:16,307
Camera slows down,
the last frame stutters

00:16:16,374 --> 00:16:17,775
gets hit with more light.

00:16:19,243 --> 00:16:23,848
BROWN:
So there's more visual
information on the negative.

00:16:23,914 --> 00:16:24,849
Right.

00:16:24,915 --> 00:16:27,885
Good editors
always cut the roll out.

00:16:29,387 --> 00:16:31,188
WILLOWS:
So all your editors' cuttings
are in there?

00:16:31,255 --> 00:16:34,558
Yep. Negatives
and unused dailies.

00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,961
Collection guy comes
by once a week.

00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:39,864
Silver on the film
makes it environmentally unsafe

00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,499
for landfill, so...

00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:42,900
Be nice if people
were as concerned

00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:44,235
about the women in these films.

00:16:44,301 --> 00:16:46,771
I am the one who called y'all,
remember?

00:16:46,837 --> 00:16:49,407
Knock yourselves
out, ladies.

00:16:50,508 --> 00:16:51,609
Thank you.

00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:54,111
Thank you.

00:16:54,178 --> 00:16:56,547
Bins of sin.

00:16:56,614 --> 00:16:59,917
Well, looks like
mostly 35 millimeter.

00:16:59,984 --> 00:17:03,721
Our 16 should've
settled at the bottom.

00:17:52,903 --> 00:17:55,439
What the heck is that?

00:17:55,506 --> 00:17:57,174
What did Trace say?

00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:59,377
Carbon steel.
There was some rust on it.

00:17:59,443 --> 00:18:00,945
Carbon steel?
19th century.

00:18:01,012 --> 00:18:02,780
Mostly used for
surgical instruments.

00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:05,249
Well, you found
some stab wounds
on the vic, right?

00:18:05,316 --> 00:18:06,584
Underneath all those ants?

00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,285
Maybe it's somebody's
old scalpel.

00:18:08,352 --> 00:18:09,487
This prong-like extension

00:18:09,553 --> 00:18:11,222
could be part of
a repeating pattern.

00:18:11,288 --> 00:18:12,990
Geometrical extrapolation?

00:18:13,057 --> 00:18:14,925
That would give us
possibilities.

00:18:14,992 --> 00:18:16,193
You got a pencil?

00:18:18,562 --> 00:18:22,033
From the tip down, the slope
looks to be slightly curved.

00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:27,705
Now, if I extend
that trace outward...

00:18:33,377 --> 00:18:36,681
What do you think?
Blade of a saw.

00:18:36,747 --> 00:18:40,017
Keep doing the math,
maybe we won't have to guess.

00:18:40,084 --> 00:18:43,120
You see how the base of
the fragment curves downward?

00:18:43,187 --> 00:18:46,457
Suggesting something circular.

00:18:55,766 --> 00:18:58,736
Repeating pattern.

00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:01,205
Circular saw, maybe.

00:19:03,374 --> 00:19:05,242
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:08,846
This doesn't seem sharp enough
for a saw.

00:19:10,114 --> 00:19:11,949
Wait a minute.

00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:14,385
I've seen one of these
before, man.

00:19:14,452 --> 00:19:18,022
A spur... cheap spur.

00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:19,557
What's that old
cowboy expression?

00:19:19,623 --> 00:19:21,359
Got to see a man about a horse.

00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,028
That reminds me.

00:19:24,095 --> 00:19:26,297
I got to see a woman
about a face.

00:19:26,364 --> 00:19:27,765
Yee-haw.

00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:30,668
You notice all the guys
in these movies

00:19:30,735 --> 00:19:33,070
are wearing condoms?

00:19:33,137 --> 00:19:36,107
Yeah, industry policy.

00:19:36,173 --> 00:19:38,109
Ever since '98.

00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:41,912
Even have a quarantine list:
who's positive, who's not.

00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:44,482
And that security guy
wore one, too.

00:19:44,548 --> 00:19:47,518
Pretty surprising
for unregulated porn.

00:19:47,585 --> 00:19:50,988
Maybe she made him wear one.

00:19:51,055 --> 00:19:53,224
I got it.

00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,158
You did?

00:19:54,225 --> 00:19:55,860
I got it, I found it.

00:19:55,926 --> 00:19:57,995
Thank God.

00:19:59,397 --> 00:20:04,201
Hot frame, all right.

00:20:04,268 --> 00:20:06,637
I still can't see who it is.

00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:08,673
You can see a little more
of the room, though.

00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:11,242
There's a small table
and a lamp in the left corner.

00:20:12,543 --> 00:20:14,445
Good eye, Sara.

00:20:14,512 --> 00:20:18,749
Yeah, that kitsch lamp.

00:20:18,816 --> 00:20:21,252
Somebody moved it out
to the lobby.

00:20:21,318 --> 00:20:24,755
I'll have Warrick go back
to the hotel and grab it.

00:20:31,262 --> 00:20:34,699
Tissue depth markers.

00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:36,033
21 of them, right?

00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,401
16 actually.

00:20:37,468 --> 00:20:40,037
Excluding five
nasal markers.

00:20:40,104 --> 00:20:41,272
Like I said.

00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:44,442
This one's very interesting.

00:20:44,508 --> 00:20:46,010
The occiput

00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:47,778
the bump on the back
center of the head

00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:49,847
unusually flat.

00:21:00,524 --> 00:21:02,426
The eyes have epicanthal folds.

00:21:02,493 --> 00:21:05,062
A triangular flap of skin

00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:08,099
that gives a vaguely
Asian appearance.

00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:12,636
You see how the bridge
of the nose is poorly developed?

00:21:12,703 --> 00:21:15,673
Almost too small
for the size of his head.

00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,242
The ears seem
slightly odd.

00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:19,410
Like the nose

00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:21,846
they too, are
disproportionate
to the head.

00:21:21,912 --> 00:21:24,482
Almost childlike.

00:21:28,853 --> 00:21:31,722
These elements are small
for the head

00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:37,061
which, in itself,
is almost too short and wide.

00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:39,830
Your victim was born
with trisomy

00:21:39,897 --> 00:21:43,401
of the twenty-first chromosome.

00:21:43,467 --> 00:21:45,636
Down's Syndrome.

00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,026
BRASS:
So I sent out a community fax

00:21:58,093 --> 00:22:00,028
to every Down's Syndrome link
in Clark

00:22:00,095 --> 00:22:01,363
and the surrounding counties.

00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:03,698
Special Olympics-type groups,
societies, schools

00:22:03,765 --> 00:22:05,100
and I got lucky.

00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:09,170
Randy Traschel, age 25.
Been missing for 17 months.

00:22:10,338 --> 00:22:12,741
I guess my ants
were off a little.

00:22:12,807 --> 00:22:15,544
"Last employer:
Las Vegas Ranch."

00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:19,915
Horses. Dung beetles.

00:22:19,981 --> 00:22:21,650
Hey, where's the tote board?

00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:24,252
Every time I see a horse,
I want to place a bet.

00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:26,888
Smells like Belmont Park,
doesn't it?

00:22:26,955 --> 00:22:28,557
You ever ridden a horse,
Grissom?

00:22:28,623 --> 00:22:30,225
Nope, just
roller coasters.

00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:32,160
( <i>horse neighing</i> )

00:22:33,962 --> 00:22:35,830
( <i>cheering</i> )

00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:42,737
Howdy.

00:22:42,804 --> 00:22:44,372
Pete Banson.

00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:46,041
Ranch manager.

00:22:46,107 --> 00:22:47,375
Howdy.

00:22:47,442 --> 00:22:49,477
Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.

00:22:49,544 --> 00:22:50,612
This is Gil Grissom,
Nick Stokes

00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:52,147
of the crime lab.

00:22:52,214 --> 00:22:53,415
What seems to be the trouble?

00:22:53,481 --> 00:22:56,184
Have you ever seen this man?

00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:58,320
Yeah, he's one
of my stall muckers.

00:22:58,386 --> 00:23:00,455
Hired him about a year
and a half ago.

00:23:00,522 --> 00:23:03,091
A little slow in the head,
but got the work done.

00:23:03,158 --> 00:23:06,895
And all of a sudden,
he up and disappeared

00:23:06,962 --> 00:23:08,797
never heard from him
since then.

00:23:08,863 --> 00:23:11,399
( <i>horse neighs</i> )

00:23:15,036 --> 00:23:19,741
Did he ever ride horses for you,
Mr. Banson?

00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:23,178
No, he just mucked the stalls
and went home.

00:23:24,312 --> 00:23:26,014
Who mucks your stalls now?

00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:28,316
Look, guys, am I in
some kind of trouble here?

00:23:28,383 --> 00:23:30,085
A former employee of yours
was murdered.

00:23:30,151 --> 00:23:32,454
Now, who mucks?

00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,156
Enrique. He's an illegal.

00:23:35,223 --> 00:23:36,358
Shocking.

00:23:36,424 --> 00:23:37,692
Where is he?

00:23:46,835 --> 00:23:49,938
There's the lamp I got
from the lobby.

00:23:50,005 --> 00:23:52,007
The bulb is red...

00:23:52,073 --> 00:23:54,009
in the film and here.

00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:57,212
Guy thinks he's Zalman King,
playing with the lighting.

00:23:58,346 --> 00:24:00,715
I guess he was going
for a certain look.

00:24:04,185 --> 00:24:06,688
You know, if I had screwed
a hot light bulb

00:24:06,755 --> 00:24:08,924
I'd probably lick my fingers.

00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,693
Saliva.

00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:19,034
Guy replaced it with a red bulb.
Got residual saliva on it.

00:24:20,702 --> 00:24:23,738

run it through CODIS.

Douglas Sampson?

00:24:46,561 --> 00:24:48,697
Yeah.

00:24:48,763 --> 00:24:51,032
The same Douglas Sampson
who did three years

00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:52,701

and battery?

00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:53,702
( <i>coughs</i> )

00:24:53,768 --> 00:24:56,171
Did. Past tense.

00:24:56,238 --> 00:24:57,739
We want to talk to you
about a recent homicide

00:24:57,806 --> 00:24:59,207
at the Mandolin Tower Hotel,
off Fremont.

00:24:59,274 --> 00:25:01,109
I'm working.

00:25:06,581 --> 00:25:08,884
Take a break.

00:25:10,585 --> 00:25:12,287
SAMPSON:
Take ten.
Give it a rest, guys.

00:25:16,591 --> 00:25:19,728
I bet I could guess
your exact height.

00:25:19,794 --> 00:25:20,362
What?

00:25:20,428 --> 00:25:21,333
That guy out front

00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,131
just confirmed
you shot a snuff film

00:25:23,198 --> 00:25:24,866
with this girl
at the Mandolin Tower Hotel.

00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:26,534
I've stayed there
over the years.

00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:28,603
I never saw her with that guy
out front.

00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,039
We've got you on
film, killing her.

00:25:31,106 --> 00:25:33,074
If you had me from any angle
I could be identified

00:25:33,141 --> 00:25:34,409
you would've arrested me
already.

00:25:34,476 --> 00:25:35,410
( <i>snickers</i> )

00:25:35,477 --> 00:25:38,446
We've got ourselves
a film student here.

00:25:38,513 --> 00:25:40,181
I'm one of the best in
adult film and I'm going to be

00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:41,550
making the jump to mainstream,
you watch.

00:25:41,616 --> 00:25:43,652
Financed by a snuff film?

00:25:43,718 --> 00:25:45,353
You have no right
to be in my house.

00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,721
I'm not breaking
any laws.

00:25:46,788 --> 00:25:49,024
I have a permit
for adult film production.

00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,759
You leave now or I'm going
to file a complaint.

00:25:50,825 --> 00:25:52,894
( <i>sniffles</i> )

00:25:52,961 --> 00:25:54,029
Getting a cold?

00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,730
Maybe you should raise
the heat.

00:25:55,797 --> 00:25:57,933
I'm sure they wouldn't mind.

00:26:00,969 --> 00:26:02,637
WILLOWS:
Hey, what do you got?

00:26:02,704 --> 00:26:05,307
This is Sampson's
car, right?

00:26:05,373 --> 00:26:07,042
Some soil up in
his wheel well.

00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:09,244
He washed the tire
and forgot the well.

00:26:09,311 --> 00:26:10,378
WILLOWS:
Butterscotch?

00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:11,713
Yeah.

00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,916
Remember that body dump
a couple years back?

00:26:14,983 --> 00:26:15,917
Yeah.

00:26:15,984 --> 00:26:16,918
Down near
the Colorado?

00:26:16,985 --> 00:26:19,721
Bidahochy Range.
Butterscotch-colored soil.

00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:22,357
I'll radio the sheriff up there.
And the park rangers.

00:26:22,424 --> 00:26:25,126
Great.

00:26:25,193 --> 00:26:26,461
BRASS:
You never met
this man?

00:26:26,528 --> 00:26:28,029
No.

00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:29,898
Stop the shoveling.

00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:31,766
Take a closer look.

00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:34,970
All I know about him
is they call him "Stubs."

00:26:35,036 --> 00:26:36,304
Stubs.

00:26:36,371 --> 00:26:37,739
What is that,
some kind of nickname?

00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:39,074
I guess.

00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,009
I hear the cowboys
joking about him.

00:26:41,076 --> 00:26:43,778
I think they call him that
because of his fingers.

00:26:43,845 --> 00:26:46,648
BRASS:
Did the other cowboys
ever make fun of him?

00:26:46,715 --> 00:26:49,851
I really don't know.

00:26:50,886 --> 00:26:53,154
Do you ride, Mr. Vasquez?

00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:54,589
Every day.

00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:55,690
You wear spurs when you ride?

00:26:55,757 --> 00:26:57,192
When I'm breaking
a horse, yes.

00:26:57,259 --> 00:26:59,694
BRASS:
You don't call this
breaking a horse, do you?

00:26:59,761 --> 00:27:02,931
I forgot to take them off.

00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:07,669
I'm going to need to take a look
at those spurs, Mr. Vasquez.

00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:33,417
Enrique said he
got those boots and
spurs from Hero's Row.

00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:37,054
Mm-hmm. That's where
the cowboys toss all
their unwanted gear.

00:27:37,121 --> 00:27:41,091
And they just leave
them there for
anyone to pick up?

00:27:41,158 --> 00:27:42,993
It's either that
or Goodwill.

00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:47,792
Hmm. Mr. Banson, the
Pro Rodeo Association

00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:50,862
banned sharp rowels
on spurs back in
the early '70s

00:27:50,928 --> 00:27:52,792
because they were found
to be cruel to horses.

00:27:52,792 --> 00:27:54,260
Yeah, I know all about that.

00:27:54,326 --> 00:27:56,128
I don't particularly
agree with it

00:27:56,195 --> 00:27:57,797
'cause as far
as I'm concerned

00:27:57,863 --> 00:28:00,533
horses are on this earth
to service human beings.

00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:02,535
There's an order
to things.

00:28:02,601 --> 00:28:05,471
Well, somebody on your ranch
is stuck in the '70s.

00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:08,507
Do you have any idea
who this spur could belong to?

00:28:10,142 --> 00:28:12,291
Billy Rattison.
Pro bronc rider.

your snuff film girl.

00:28:17,505 --> 00:28:18,472
Where?

00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:19,707
By the river.

00:28:19,773 --> 00:28:21,475
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:28:50,905 --> 00:28:53,073

with post?

00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,643
He's working evidence
from the riverbed.

00:28:55,709 --> 00:28:57,077
You going to be
able to I.D. her?

00:28:57,144 --> 00:28:58,879
Already did,
from her dental records.

00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,748
Susan Hodap, 26.

00:29:00,814 --> 00:29:05,386
Exsanguination from
a trans-section of
the carotid artery.

00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,820
Slicing stab.

00:29:06,887 --> 00:29:10,357
Any chance of finding any
serration marks on the bone?

00:29:10,424 --> 00:29:11,559
To tie to a knife?

00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:15,296
Eh, that'll entail a boil,
but sure, I can try.

00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:17,031
What I can tell you conclusively

00:29:17,097 --> 00:29:19,533
is that Susan Hodap was already
on borrowed time.

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,102
I tapped her
cerebral spinal fluid

00:29:22,169 --> 00:29:26,106
didn't wait for a batch,
had the lab run it solo.

00:29:26,173 --> 00:29:28,542
She was HIV positive.

00:29:32,246 --> 00:29:34,882
Susan Hodap...

00:29:40,855 --> 00:29:43,591
There it is.

00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:46,360
Tested positive six months ago.

00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,498
I can't believe that porn
actors' monthly health records

00:29:51,565 --> 00:29:52,600
are on the Internet.

00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:53,767
Yeah, right.

00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:56,537
The rule is, the actor
tests positive twice

00:29:56,604 --> 00:29:58,572
they go on permanent quarantine.

00:30:03,277 --> 00:30:05,179
That's why she ended up
in that snuff film.

00:30:05,246 --> 00:30:06,847
She got bounced out
of regular porn.

00:30:06,914 --> 00:30:09,316
Walked right into
her own death scene.

00:30:09,383 --> 00:30:12,052

Billy Rattison's truck?

Yes, sir. It is.

with him.

about no damn retard.

He wasn't a "retard,"
Mr. Rattison.

He had what we call
Down's Syndrome.

00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:53,805
We may have something.

00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:54,639
Really.

00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,007
Right here.
I wanted to show you.

00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:58,009
When he's stabbing her

00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,478
she's bleeding all over him.

00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:03,314
Well, a void proves that,
but we still can't
prove it's him.

00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,649
Yeah, but her blood might.

00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,651
Catherine and I suspect
transference.

00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,186
She had HIV.

00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:10,522
Well, how are we going to get
a sample of Sampson's blood?

00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,157
Warrant, based on
the butterscotch dirt

00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:13,658
that <i>you</i> found on his car.

00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,560
Oh. I like that.

00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:18,330
You might want to apologize
to the phone book.

00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:37,048
GRISSOM:
We sliced the shard

00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,550
into layers of 100 microns

00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,919
to measure the level
of oxidation.

00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:44,022
Moisture from the body
hits the carbon steel

00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:45,924
and then corrosion begins.

00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:50,929
<i>And we can be certain that</i>
<i>there was moisture right away.</i>

00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:53,131
So it's like slicing
the mold off of bread.

00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,165
And measuring it.

00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:57,102
The rust penetrated
the 13th layer

00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:59,604
and just barely
in the 14th.

00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:02,474
Archie, run the weather.

00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,542
National Weather Service
for Las Vegas.

00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,244
Average relative humidity
30.29.

00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:12,517
Temperature 22.61 Celsius.

00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:14,819
So, corrosion
versus time...

00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:19,758
March, 2000.

00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,661
Spur exposure time
was exactly 17 months.

00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,529
And we can testify
to this.

00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:27,832
Missing persons were right.
The ants were off.

00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,301
Yeah, so was Rattison.

00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:32,103
He was in town.

00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,414
Two feet.

00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:17,682
We have reason
to believe

00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:19,617
the wounds that
killed Randy Traschel

00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:21,219
were made by one
of your bulls.

00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:24,522
That's why we cut the horns,
to prevent such.

00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:27,792
We're looking
for horns with
points attached.

00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,595
Yeah. We need to see
your other bulls.

00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:32,630
Curly's the only
one I got.

00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:40,705
What do you all want now?

00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:42,540
BRASS:
We're waiting on you,
actually.

00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:45,343
Mr. Rattison, we have reason
to believe you were in town

00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,512
the month that Randy Traschel
was murdered.

00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:48,546
Could you tell us

00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:50,682
what used to be here?

00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:51,783
My belt buckles.

00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,686
Somebody stole it
last year, like I said.

00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:56,588
You do get a lot of stuff
stolen, don't you?

00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,456
Mind if we look

00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,291
around your truck?

00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,395
Sure.

00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,271
Don't get any tobacco juice
on my shoe.

00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:33,058
Got a tape measure?

00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,764
18 inches.

00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:43,535
Phenolphthalein.

00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:57,315
Positive for blood.

00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:00,318
Looks like the only thing
stolen around here

00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,253
was Randy Traschel's life.

00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,031
( <i>horse neighing</i> )

00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:20,205
What you laughing at, huh?

00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:22,007
You want to come
over here and try it?

00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,214
( <i>chuckling</i> )

00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,121
( <i>laughter</i> )

00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,417
By the way

00:38:02,417 --> 00:38:04,625
the definition of
the word "retard"

00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:08,486
is "to hinder" or "to
hold someone back."

00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:12,891
I think your life is
about to become retarded.

00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,932
Okay, one more time,
for the record:

00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:24,336
You have never had
sexual intercourse
with Susan Hodap?

00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,571
I told you, I've never
even met her.

00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,250
I know, but
I got to ask.

00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,417
You've never
had sex with her?

00:38:30,417 --> 00:38:31,484
Not ever.

00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:46,278
You still have those chills,
Mr. Sampson?

00:38:46,344 --> 00:38:47,679
Feeling hot, achy?

00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,208
Back of your
throat scratchy?

00:38:50,985 --> 00:38:52,041
Yeah, it is.

00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:54,708
Original flu.

00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:57,444
Happens at the onset
of HIV.

00:38:57,511 --> 00:38:59,046
Seroconversion.

00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:02,410
Usually presents
two to six weeks

00:39:02,477 --> 00:39:04,546
after the exchange
of fluids.

00:39:04,613 --> 00:39:06,047
Exchange of fluids?

00:39:06,114 --> 00:39:08,383
That temperature is
your body working up

00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,951
a resistance to the virus.

00:39:10,018 --> 00:39:13,121
HIV? Me?

00:39:13,188 --> 00:39:14,656
Now, come on.

00:39:14,723 --> 00:39:16,725
You just took my blood
a few days ago.

00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:19,494
A private lab can
run a virus test
within a day.

00:39:19,561 --> 00:39:21,663
CDC doesn't
broadcast that.

00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,999
Tests are
very expensive.

00:39:24,065 --> 00:39:25,934
We dipped into the budget
just for you.

00:39:26,001 --> 00:39:28,136
You're playing me.
I don't have HIV.

00:39:28,203 --> 00:39:29,304
Susan Hodap had it.

00:39:29,371 --> 00:39:31,673
The exact same strain
that you have.

00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,074
We had that lab do

00:39:33,141 --> 00:39:36,645
what's called
a phylogenetic analysis

00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:38,346
of your HIV's DNA
and Susan's.

00:39:38,413 --> 00:39:41,917
SIDLE:
As you can see,
the genes are identical.

00:39:41,983 --> 00:39:44,458
Which means Susan gave it
directly to you.

00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:45,359
But we never had sex.

00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:46,761
You did stab her, though.

00:39:48,129 --> 00:39:49,463
And at that moment...

00:39:49,959 --> 00:39:51,294
<i>her arterial blood</i>

00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,862
<i>hit your eyes</i>

00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:55,665
<i>entering your body through</i>
<i>the conjunctival membrane.</i>

00:39:55,731 --> 00:39:59,035
Non-sexual transmission
is extremely difficult

00:39:59,102 --> 00:40:01,170
but obviously it's possible.

00:40:01,237 --> 00:40:04,807
Susan's blood was absorbed
into your bloodstream.

00:40:04,874 --> 00:40:06,417
WILLOWS:
<i>Where the new HIV cells</i>

00:40:06,417 --> 00:40:08,485
<i>immediately started attaching</i>

00:40:08,552 --> 00:40:10,166
<i>to your</i>
<i>healthy white blood cells.</i>

00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:14,166
<i>Gets inside one, replicates</i>
<i>about 2,000 times.</i>

00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:17,036
<i>Disables the host cell,</i>
<i>pinches back out</i>

00:40:17,103 --> 00:40:18,904
<i>infecting more good cells...</i>

00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,602
lowering your immune system

00:40:22,669 --> 00:40:25,171
until your body loses
its ability

00:40:25,238 --> 00:40:28,274
to fight off even
the simplest invader.

00:40:28,341 --> 00:40:30,610
Of course, the strains
will have changed by then

00:40:30,677 --> 00:40:33,546
and you and Susan Hodap will
have a different strain of HIV.

00:40:33,613 --> 00:40:36,283
The sooner you
see a doctor

00:40:36,349 --> 00:40:38,852
the better your chances
for longevity.

00:40:38,918 --> 00:40:42,088
But for now, we got you.

00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,325
You killed her.

00:40:48,792 --> 00:40:50,125
I guess she killed you back.
