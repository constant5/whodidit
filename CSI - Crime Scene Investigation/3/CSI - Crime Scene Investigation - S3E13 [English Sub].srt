00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:15,910
I'm so sorry.
I got to go, baby.

00:00:15,977 --> 00:00:16,911
I'll call you tomorrow.

00:00:16,978 --> 00:00:18,746
WOMAN:
<i>Just one more minute.</i>

00:00:18,813 --> 00:00:20,481
( <i>electronic gunshots)</i>

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,935
FATHER:
Turn it off.

00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:24,303
I'm not going
to say it again.

00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:26,305
Dad, just five more minutes
and I'll be on level nine.

00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:27,306
Now!

00:00:27,372 --> 00:00:28,907
GIRL:
Dad!

00:00:28,974 --> 00:00:30,742
You said I can watch
Nickelodeon.

00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:32,377
You've watched enough TV
for tonight.

00:00:32,444 --> 00:00:33,545
It's time to go to bed.

00:00:33,612 --> 00:00:35,247
How come he doesn't have to?

00:00:35,314 --> 00:00:37,015
Both of you, bed now!

00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:42,220
Dad!

00:00:42,287 --> 00:00:43,889
You got to save it first.

00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:45,290
This game saves it
automatically.

00:00:49,728 --> 00:00:50,662
Oh, no, no, you know

00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:51,964
how much sugar's
in that thing?

00:00:52,664 --> 00:00:55,100
( <i>gunshots)</i>

00:00:59,738 --> 00:01:00,906
( <i>car tires squealing)</i>

00:01:00,973 --> 00:01:03,041
Son, are you all right?

00:01:04,242 --> 00:01:05,177
Aimee?

00:01:05,243 --> 00:01:06,778
Aimee! Aimee!

00:01:06,845 --> 00:01:08,280
Aimee.

00:01:21,426 --> 00:01:22,761
BROWN:
Hey.

00:01:22,828 --> 00:01:24,463
GRISSOM:
Didn't you grow up
in this neighborhood?

00:01:24,529 --> 00:01:25,597
Yeah, not too far away.

00:01:25,664 --> 00:01:27,299
My grandmother still
lives down the block.

00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:28,634
Lot of familiar faces.

00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,702
MAN:
Hey, Brown, you going to
find the guy who did this?

00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:31,837
We're going to do our jobs.

00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:34,840
Jason Gilbert.
Shot through and through.

00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:37,009
He's going to be
all right, though.

00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:38,710
What was he doing here?

00:01:38,777 --> 00:01:40,912
BRASS:
Visiting his girlfriend
next door. He hit the deck

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,248
when the shooting started.
Didn't see a car.

00:01:43,315 --> 00:01:44,283
Drive-by.

00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:46,184
His girlfriend
see anything?

00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:48,687
Nobody saw a thing.

00:01:48,754 --> 00:01:51,223
Little girl inside
wasn't so lucky.

00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,059
Aimee Phelps,
age nine.

00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:55,060
Phelps?

00:01:55,127 --> 00:01:58,730
Father operates a rec center
down the block.

00:02:03,702 --> 00:02:05,671
What happened, man?

00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:10,008
They killed my baby.

00:02:10,075 --> 00:02:11,009
( <i>sobs</i> )

00:02:11,076 --> 00:02:13,612
I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry.

00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:17,082
BROWN:
I got here as quick
as I could.

00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,017
What happened?

00:02:19,084 --> 00:02:22,354
Cops said they were aiming
at some white kid.

00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:25,357
I thought I was making
a difference.

00:02:25,424 --> 00:02:26,391
( <i>sobs</i> )

00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,460
You are making
a difference.

00:02:28,527 --> 00:02:29,494
I'm living proof.

00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:31,463
I'm sorry.

00:03:37,963 --> 00:03:39,932
You going to be able
to handle this?

00:03:45,437 --> 00:03:47,839
I want this case.

Matt told me his house was
broken into about a week ago.

00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:26,583
They took all of his awards,
his medals.

00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,008
Everything in this case.

00:04:29,276 --> 00:04:30,277
I hope whoever took it,

00:04:30,343 --> 00:04:32,712
it meant as much
to them as it did to him.

00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:35,282
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:37,484
Well, we're obviously
looking for an automatic.

00:04:37,551 --> 00:04:40,220
BROWN:
No doubt.
All this damage.

00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,760
The bullets went
through the glass,

00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:45,750
shed their jackets

00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,019
or disintegrated completely
on impact with the wall.

00:04:49,988 --> 00:04:53,491
All we have left are
lead cores, which are
of no comparison value.

00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:59,163
The only bullet
that may help us

00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,765
is inside that little girl.

00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:04,068
HyperTrix?

00:05:04,135 --> 00:05:05,803
Sounds like a
breakfast cereal.

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,305
Some Internet
service thing.

00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:08,339
I stopped thinking

00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:10,508
about that stuff when I
found out my NASDAQ fund

00:05:10,575 --> 00:05:12,844
was worth less than my son's
comic book collection.

00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:13,878
Dot com, dot bomb.

00:05:13,945 --> 00:05:16,247
The office floor
where the DB's located

00:05:16,314 --> 00:05:18,583
is restricted--
authorized employees only.

00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,951
I'll need the access log.

00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:22,820
I already spoke
to building security.

00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:24,989
Cool.

00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:32,964
Night shift started
at 6:00 p.m.

00:05:33,031 --> 00:05:33,965
STOKES:
And since then,

00:05:34,032 --> 00:05:35,700
four people have entered
the building,

00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:37,402
and nobody left.

00:05:37,468 --> 00:05:39,204
VEGA:
Three of them are
still breathing.

00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:42,941
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:05:45,276 --> 00:05:46,211
Ooh.

00:05:46,277 --> 00:05:47,679
Hey, David.
Nick.

00:05:47,745 --> 00:05:49,547
Cool enough
in here for you?

00:05:49,614 --> 00:05:50,548
I'll manage.

00:05:50,615 --> 00:05:52,517
Most computers dissipate over
two thirds

00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:53,985
of the energy
they consume as heat.

00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:54,986
AC's here for them,

00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:57,322
not the worker bees.

00:05:57,388 --> 00:05:58,423
Victim's name's Garret Kwan.

00:05:58,489 --> 00:05:59,490
Job title, CTO.

00:05:59,557 --> 00:06:00,859
Chief Technology Officer.

00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:02,427
T.O.D.?

00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:06,865
Ambient here's
about 65 degrees,

00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:10,869
which makes core temp drop
roughly two degrees per hour.

00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:13,905
Figure he's been dead
five to seven hours.

00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:15,540
Apparent blunt
force trauma.

00:06:15,607 --> 00:06:17,809
Minimal seepage
around the wound.

00:06:17,876 --> 00:06:19,677
No blood on the floor.

00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:21,446
The paramedics roll him?

00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:22,480
Uh, yeah.

00:06:22,547 --> 00:06:25,049
Said they found him face down,
head towards the rack.

00:06:25,116 --> 00:06:26,751
Any sign of a weapon?

00:06:26,818 --> 00:06:27,919
Nothing obvious.

00:06:27,986 --> 00:06:29,053
No windows.

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,388
Only one way in or out.

00:06:30,455 --> 00:06:32,957
Yeah, but there's plenty
of places to hide.

00:06:35,426 --> 00:06:36,995
Okay.
One dead boss.

00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:38,730
Three live employees.

00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:41,966
I like the odds.

00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:47,071
BRASS:
So, Jason Gilbert,

00:06:47,138 --> 00:06:48,072
the kid who was shot,

00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:49,440
not too popular
in the neighborhood.

00:06:49,507 --> 00:06:51,609
Just in a fight last week,
down the street.

00:06:51,676 --> 00:06:52,610
Yeah?

00:06:52,677 --> 00:06:53,645
Uh-huh.

00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:54,846
You saw his girl.

00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:56,181
She was hot.

00:06:56,247 --> 00:06:57,682
They're probably
macking on her.

00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,919
Matt said he heard
tires screech.

00:07:00,985 --> 00:07:01,920
Mm-hmm.

00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:03,721
And the bullets went
from right to left.

00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:05,790
Uh-huh.

00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:09,227
Over there?

00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:16,601
You know, it's
a federal offense

00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:18,102
to be messing with
the postal service.

00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:20,738
Took that corner
pretty hard, huh?

00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:22,273
Yeah.

00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:39,123
Doesn't that dent look
a little high to you?

00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,525
Like a truck or an SUV?

00:07:43,328 --> 00:07:45,096
Yeah.

00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:48,266
I'm not just another
pretty face, you know.

00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:52,103
There's a silver paint transfer,
though, right here.

00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,137
Captain.
Yeah?

00:07:53,204 --> 00:07:54,239
Just got a call.

00:07:54,305 --> 00:07:55,473
PJ's tavern, a few block away.

00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,008
Guy was brandishing
an automatic weapon.

00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:58,710
They're holding him
at the site.

00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,348
This guy's a punk.

00:08:03,414 --> 00:08:04,883
Hey, tell me
what you're telling him.

00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:06,217
This guy's no good.

00:08:06,284 --> 00:08:08,186
He's been in here before,
and every time it's trouble,

00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:10,655
so this time, I exercised
my right not to serve him.

00:08:10,722 --> 00:08:12,490
You know what
the little freak does?

00:08:12,557 --> 00:08:15,126
Lifts up his jacket,
and shows me a piece.

00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:16,294
I tell him
to take a hike.

00:08:16,361 --> 00:08:17,295
BRASS:
Yeah?

00:08:17,362 --> 00:08:19,097
Then he proceeds
to tell me

00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:21,199
how I better watch my back,
'cause it wouldn't be

00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:22,800
the first time tonight
he killed somebody.

00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:24,235
No kidding. All right.

00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:26,437
Jay...

00:08:26,504 --> 00:08:27,472
Jacobs?

00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:28,973
No, it's Gene Jaycobs.

00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,542
Gene Jaycobs.

00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:32,544
I knew that kid.

00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,745
I went to school
with him.

00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:34,913
He got kicked out.

00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,348
Okay, let's see what the lad
has to say for himself.

00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:38,416
Thanks a lot.

00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:41,586
Gene Jaycobs

00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:42,754
Uncuff him.

00:08:44,322 --> 00:08:45,690
Do I know you?

00:08:45,757 --> 00:08:47,492
Put your hands out
in front of you.

00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,827
Oh, it's like that, huh?

00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,583
I can process this now.

00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,792
It would tell me
if you fired a gun

00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,594
within the last
couple of hours.

00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,362
But I'm going to take this
back to the lab,

00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:06,397
make you sweat it out.

00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:09,083
BRASS:
Okay, Officer,

00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,820
I think someone needs
their cuffs put back on.

00:09:14,823 --> 00:09:16,191
I know what that is.

00:09:16,257 --> 00:09:18,193
You're checking me
for blood spatter.

00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:20,195
I watch the Discovery Channel.

00:09:20,261 --> 00:09:22,630
I found the body,
I called the police.

00:09:22,697 --> 00:09:26,000
Not too smart, if I'm the one
who killed the guy.

00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:27,869
( <i>quietly</i> ):
That's good.

00:09:31,306 --> 00:09:33,241
Not too... Not too smart,
if I'm the one who...

00:09:33,308 --> 00:09:36,945
Mr. Benton, could you stand up
for me, please?

00:09:44,953 --> 00:09:46,588
I know what that... is.

00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:49,190
I know what that is.

00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:51,485
You're checking me
for blood spatter.

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,834
I watch the
Discovery Channel.

00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,810
Look, I... I found the body,
I called the police.

00:09:57,877 --> 00:10:00,613
Not too smart, if I'm the
one who killed the guy.

00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,181
Thanks for pointing that out.

00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:04,484
When was the last time
you saw Garret Kwan?

00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,542
I didn't; not tonight.

00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:06,576
I was working.

00:10:06,643 --> 00:10:09,546
Working halfway to
carpal tunnel syndrome.

00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:11,748
So-called ergonomic chairs.

00:10:11,815 --> 00:10:15,318
Should be a crime,
if you ask me.

00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,622
The chairs are...
okay, you know,

00:10:18,688 --> 00:10:20,156
it's, it's not like my office

00:10:20,223 --> 00:10:21,658
has a good view of the door.

00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:23,460
You should be
talking to Charlie.

00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:25,428
Charlie has the good view.

00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:26,563
Charlie?

00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,643
Yeah, okay, yeah,
um, Charlie...

00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,278
Charlie doesn't
work here anymore,

00:10:35,345 --> 00:10:36,813
so that doesn't
really help you.

00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:39,482
Could you hold your hands
out for me, please?

00:10:42,385 --> 00:10:44,687
Pretty easy to see the door

00:10:44,754 --> 00:10:47,056
to the server farm
from here.

00:10:47,123 --> 00:10:48,491
That is a fact.

00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:49,959
And here's another.

00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:51,625
I didn't see anything.

00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,559
I was coding.

00:10:52,626 --> 00:10:54,494
Link. Compile. Debug.

00:10:54,561 --> 00:10:56,296
All night.

00:10:56,363 --> 00:10:58,064
The work absorbs me.

00:10:58,131 --> 00:10:59,533
What kind of work?

00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:01,701
My code monitors Internet
traffic and server load.

00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:06,006
So you make your computer
watch other computers

00:11:06,072 --> 00:11:07,207
that other people
are watching?

00:11:07,274 --> 00:11:10,143
Just because you can't see
the beauty in data flow

00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,045
doesn't mean it
doesn't exist.

00:11:12,112 --> 00:11:13,914
What was your relationship
to Garret Kwan?

00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,082
I'm employee number seven.

00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:17,984
Kwan was employee number six.

00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:21,655
Big brain by reputation,

00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:23,123
my boss by random chance.

00:11:28,995 --> 00:11:30,564
You know, they, um,
they confiscated

00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,632
all my murder weapons
when I left Microsoft,

00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:34,234
so I don't know
if you'll find anything.

00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:37,103
Yeah, you don't exactly
fit the corporate image.

00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,672
Well, it's my image,

00:11:38,738 --> 00:11:40,173
the company doesn't
get a say in it.

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,009
VEGA:
Looks like you get special
treatment around here.

00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:44,978
Yeah, well, I earn it.

00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:46,780
I optimize 'Net infrastructure.

00:11:46,847 --> 00:11:49,249
I saved this company
$8.3 mill last year.

00:11:49,316 --> 00:11:51,084
Got a five-figure bonus.

00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:54,187
And, uh, yes,
I did see Garret

00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:56,490
go into the server farm
around 6:00, 6:30.

00:11:56,556 --> 00:11:58,191
STOKES:
So your boss is
laying there dead

00:11:58,258 --> 00:12:00,293
for five and a
half hours plus,

00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,928
and you never even
notice he's gone.

00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:05,265
Oh... well, I mean,
nobody else did, either.

00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:08,635
Look, I was, you know...

00:12:08,702 --> 00:12:09,970
Working.

00:12:10,036 --> 00:12:12,172
That is what we do here.

00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:13,673
Right.

00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,542
Bullet entered
through the throat,

00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,210
severing the spinal column.

00:12:17,277 --> 00:12:19,646
C2's adjacent
to the brain stem.

00:12:19,713 --> 00:12:22,482
Sever that, respiration
shuts down,

00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:25,318
resulting in almost
immediate death.

00:12:27,587 --> 00:12:30,490
Wood splinters embedded
in the jacket.

00:12:30,557 --> 00:12:32,893
Well, it went
through a bookcase.

00:12:34,261 --> 00:12:35,629
Nine millimeter.

00:12:38,565 --> 00:12:40,100
Thanks.

00:12:44,271 --> 00:12:46,406
( <i>muffled automatic gunfire</i> )

00:12:48,608 --> 00:12:50,610
( <i>water splashes in tank</i> )

00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:54,714
Hi.

00:12:56,783 --> 00:12:58,318
( <i>sharp clank</i> )

00:13:08,228 --> 00:13:09,162
All right.

00:13:09,229 --> 00:13:11,598
Bingo.

00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,066
Your bullet came from that gun.

00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:14,501
You're sure.

00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:15,836
Yeah, I'm sure.

00:13:15,902 --> 00:13:17,270
We got him.

00:13:17,337 --> 00:13:19,172
BRASS:
<i>So, Jason Gilbert--</i>
<i>what did he</i>

00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:21,708
ever do to you?
Drawing a blank.

00:13:21,775 --> 00:13:24,578
The kid you shot!
I didn't shoot nobody, man.

00:13:24,644 --> 00:13:25,579
Jason's girlfriend told us

00:13:25,645 --> 00:13:26,847
that you were practically
stalking her.

00:13:26,913 --> 00:13:28,348
She must have turned you down
a hundred times.

00:13:28,415 --> 00:13:30,117
You didn't like that, did you?
Is that what she told you?

00:13:30,183 --> 00:13:31,118
Yeah.
Lying bitch!

00:13:31,184 --> 00:13:32,853
I found that gun!

00:13:35,922 --> 00:13:37,124
<i>Gun was jammed,</i>

00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,083
I cleared it.

00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,251
You cleared it,
all right--

00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,420
into Mr. Phelps's home,
killing his daughter!

00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,821
No, it was the last bullet.

00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,990
What are you talking about?
You threatened a bartender

00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,725
with an empty gun?
He didn't know that.

00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,727
I can show you where I found it:

00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,763
Alleyway behind
Washington Avenue,

00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,831
( <i>over speaker</i> ):
next to a big
yellow dumpster.

00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:53,766
BROWN:
Oh, come on.

00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,100
That's it?

00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,803
That's his genius story?

00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,473
We only found a small amount
of GSR on his hands.

00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,942
Could have been transfer

00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,344
from just picking up
the murder weapon.

00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,413
He's lying.

00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,218
BROWN:
Our shooter isn't only a liar,
he's a thief.

00:14:18,285 --> 00:14:20,020
Found tons of electronic
equipment in there,

00:14:20,087 --> 00:14:22,189
still in the boxes.

00:14:22,256 --> 00:14:25,325
Well, either he's buying in
bulk, or that stuff's hot.

00:14:25,392 --> 00:14:26,560
No guns or ammo.

00:14:26,627 --> 00:14:28,729
But I do have his car keys.

00:14:45,913 --> 00:14:47,915
( <i>car alarm chirps</i> )

00:15:03,897 --> 00:15:07,333
I'm afraid the only bullets
in here are silver bullets.

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,237
I may have something here.

00:15:10,304 --> 00:15:12,917
The shooter's vehicle
took out a mailbox.

00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:14,291
The dent's in
the right spot,

00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,917
and the car is the
right silver color

00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:17,752
You got any paint transfer?

00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:20,054
Nothing visible.

00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:23,091
Call auto detail.
We'll tow it back to the lab.

00:15:23,157 --> 00:15:24,859
Blow came from an object

00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:27,662
roughly rectangular
in shape, resulting in

00:15:27,729 --> 00:15:29,330
a depressed fracture
of the parietal bone,

00:15:29,397 --> 00:15:31,733
with radiating linear
fractures extending outward

00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:32,934
from the point of impact.

00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:34,435
Based on the fracture pattern,

00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:36,571
I'd say it was a single
strike to the head.

00:15:36,638 --> 00:15:38,573
Explains the lack of spatter
at the scene.

00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,074
First hit's free.

00:15:40,141 --> 00:15:42,010
Killer knew what
he was doing.

00:15:42,076 --> 00:15:44,712
And, uh, take a look at this.

00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:45,713
Black plastic.

00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,848
Found it in the wound.

00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:50,752
Possible transfer
from a murder weapon?

00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:02,825
Hey.

00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,458
I heard you
got the shooter.

00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,401
It's not that simple.

00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,895
You think it's him?

00:16:09,895 --> 00:16:13,440
We got all our guys on
this, Matt, all right?

00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:14,975
Yeah.

00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:20,413
You still using them
same old uniforms?

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,881
That stuff's expensive, man.

00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:23,583
Yeah.

00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:28,455
But we managed to get the
basketball court tarmacked,

00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,323
thanks to contributions
from folk like you.

00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,592
Hey, I ain't stupid.

00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,361
I know where I came from.

00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,529
I wouldn't be anywhere,
if it weren't for this place.

00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:37,864
Well, you was
always going places.

00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:40,033
You just lacked discipline.

00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,235
Still do.

00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:46,873
I don't recognize
this ugly-ass gang symbol.

00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,576
You know, it's, it's hard
to keep up with it all.

00:16:49,643 --> 00:16:50,911
I just don't know anymore.

00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:52,512
What with all
the break-ins...

00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:53,780
Break-ins?!

00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,216
Rec Center's van was
stolen a couple days ago.

00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,393
How am I going to
tell these kids

00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,528
that they can't play
in the semifinals

00:17:01,595 --> 00:17:04,031
'cause I got no way
of getting them there?

00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,094
I'll look into it
for you, all right?

00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:08,629
We'll get them there.

00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,435
When's Aimee's service?

00:17:16,003 --> 00:17:18,839
Wednesday.

00:17:18,906 --> 00:17:21,909
Matt, if there's
anything I can do...

00:17:23,744 --> 00:17:25,887
Just get me five minutes
alone with the shooter.

00:17:25,887 --> 00:17:27,122
Just five minutes.

00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,825
I know it's not going
to bring Aimee back...

00:17:32,763 --> 00:17:34,565
but I can't sleep at night,

00:17:34,632 --> 00:17:37,668
knowing that he's still
breathing out there.

00:17:39,471 --> 00:17:40,887
Can you?

00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:43,857

What?

00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:55,406
( <i>indistinct conversation</i> )

00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:56,574
Mr. Phelps,

00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:58,409
it's good to see you again, sir.

00:17:58,476 --> 00:18:00,144
Would you excuse us a moment?

00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:02,213
Warrick.

00:18:04,282 --> 00:18:05,550
What's he doing here?

00:18:05,616 --> 00:18:07,718
If Jaycobs is going to
slip through our fingers,

00:18:07,785 --> 00:18:10,121
I need someone else
to explain to him
what went wrong.

00:18:10,187 --> 00:18:12,256
This was not a good idea.

00:18:13,491 --> 00:18:15,726
That's supposed to be
his alibi?

00:18:16,761 --> 00:18:17,995
David Artiss.

00:18:18,062 --> 00:18:19,297
Says he was
with our suspect

00:18:19,363 --> 00:18:20,531
the night of the drive-by.

00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:22,333
Says he dropped him off
at PJ's Tavern

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,834
right before we
picked him up.

00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:26,583
Says he also saw
him find the Mac.

00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,440
Clothes he slept in,
bloodshot eyes.

00:18:29,507 --> 00:18:30,875
The guy's a junkie, Grissom.

00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:33,644
You can see it, I can see it,
and the jury will see it.

00:18:33,711 --> 00:18:35,947
DA listened to
the alibi's statement.

00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:38,082
He knows it's questionable,
but, uh....

00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:39,050
But what?
Half an hour

00:18:39,116 --> 00:18:40,384
before the house
was shot up,

00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:42,653
Jaycobs and his alibi
were at the Sports Chalet.

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,875
Come on.

00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,290
Salesperson remembered
seeing both of them.

00:18:46,357 --> 00:18:48,492
They bought a baseball bat.
Artiss even has the receipt.

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,461
Sports Chalet is
ten minutes away.

00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:51,429
That's no alibi.

00:18:51,495 --> 00:18:53,464
I don't know.
After what the DA heard, he said

00:18:53,531 --> 00:18:54,699
he's not going to file charges.

00:18:54,765 --> 00:18:55,933
Doesn't want the clock to tick.

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,468
So that's it?

00:18:57,535 --> 00:18:59,470

As easy as that,
he walks.

Look at it this way--

00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:02,139
you have more time
to build your case.

00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:03,441
Is that him?

00:19:04,842 --> 00:19:06,510
Why are they
letting him go?

00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:09,347
Why are they
letting him go?!

00:19:09,413 --> 00:19:11,182
What are you guys doing?

00:19:18,322 --> 00:19:19,924
What are you doing?!

00:19:20,858 --> 00:19:22,293
He killed my daughter!

00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:29,066
They're going to put Jaycobs
in protective custody

00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:30,601
to avoid repercussions
in the community.

00:19:30,668 --> 00:19:32,537
Where are we going
to put Warrick?

00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:36,073

00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,009
It was kind of fun
being out in the field.

I got a flair for it.

You bucking
for a promotion?

00:19:47,018 --> 00:19:49,253
Not bucking...

00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,155

00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:53,624
You know people put their lives
on these hard drives?

00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,827
Yeah, yeah, that's
what I'm counting on.

00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:12,343

Are these, uh,

00:20:26,557 --> 00:20:27,725
I'm a little confused.

00:20:30,161 --> 00:20:31,429
No, um...

00:20:31,495 --> 00:20:33,531
this is actually
harmless fun, so...

00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:37,635
Garret Kwan was suing you
for sexual harassment.

00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:40,838
Are you, um, familiar
with the term "spurious"?

Are you familiar with the term
"murder suspect"?

I was available, okay?
Low pressure.

00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,692
The guy freaked out,
he thought I was

00:20:50,758 --> 00:20:53,458
trying to get him into
some bogus lawsuit,

00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,863
so he preempted me
with one of his own.

00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:56,598
It's called a scare tactic.

00:20:57,721 --> 00:20:59,638
Scared to lose your job?

Scared enough to kill him?

00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:04,708
Okay, look, I was
flirting with the guy.

This trophy was given to
the rec center last year.

I found all this stuff
in Jaycobs' car.

Well, if this is evidence,

00:22:12,689 --> 00:22:14,691
it needs to be tagged
and catalogued.

00:22:14,758 --> 00:22:16,927
This is the same guy who shot
Matt's daughter in the head.

00:22:16,994 --> 00:22:19,029
He's walking around
laughing at us.

00:22:19,096 --> 00:22:20,250
Can you prove that?

Okay, thanks.

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,689
Yeah, but that's not what
I wanted to talk about.

00:30:35,807 --> 00:30:37,742
you were a nerd, Brown.

00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:39,678
You were, remember?

00:30:39,744 --> 00:30:40,945
Every kid there used to

00:30:41,012 --> 00:30:43,014
beat your ass.

00:30:43,081 --> 00:30:44,716
Thick glasses,

00:30:44,783 --> 00:30:46,217
hand-me-down clothes,

00:30:46,284 --> 00:30:48,320
always with a book in your hand,

00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:53,258
like you were better
than everybody else.

00:30:53,325 --> 00:30:55,460
Nigga, I ain't scared of you.

00:30:56,695 --> 00:30:59,531
Want to step outside, then?

00:30:59,597 --> 00:31:01,132
( <i>scoffs</i> )

00:31:01,199 --> 00:31:02,701
( <i>door slams</i> )

00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:07,235
DR. LEWIS:
Fractured nasal bone,

00:31:07,302 --> 00:31:08,870
fracture of the right
zygomatic arch

00:31:08,937 --> 00:31:10,071
extending
into the maxilla.

00:31:10,138 --> 00:31:11,840
Fracture of the
right anterior ribs...

00:31:11,907 --> 00:31:13,008
Assistant D.A.'s
office, please.

00:31:13,074 --> 00:31:13,708
Who found him?

00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:14,976
Motel manager called it in.

00:31:15,043 --> 00:31:16,611
No weapon
was found at the scene.

00:31:16,678 --> 00:31:19,375
Thank God his assailant
only used his fists.

00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:21,116
Given the severity
of force,

00:31:21,182 --> 00:31:22,617
anything else
would have killed him

00:31:22,684 --> 00:31:23,785
Thank you, Doctor.

00:31:23,852 --> 00:31:25,186
Yeah, this is Jim Brass.

00:31:25,253 --> 00:31:26,888
I'm at Desert Palm Hospital.

00:31:26,955 --> 00:31:29,224
I'm looking at
a half dead Gene Jaycobs.

00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:30,725
Now, only two people
knew where he was.

00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:31,860
That was you and me.

00:31:31,927 --> 00:31:34,162
You want to tell me how
the hell this could happen?

00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,242
What, you think I did this?

00:31:47,309 --> 00:31:49,244
I don't jump to conclusions.

00:31:49,311 --> 00:31:51,413
Well, I didn't.

00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:53,750
I'd like to shake
the hand

00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,834
of the guy that did, though.

00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:56,469
Well, you may get a chance.

00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,119
Your new assignment.

00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,589
Check out the pattern
in the center

00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,124
of this contusion.

00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,759
It's probative.

00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,301
No suspect.

00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:17,970
No motive.

00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:19,405
No weapon.

00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:22,875
You don't just spontaneously
develop a fatal head wound.

00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,476
Somebody had to kill him.

00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:28,847
A guy goes into a room with
no windows and no doors.

00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,682
How does he get out?

00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:33,285
I don't know.

00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:35,254
Same way he got in.

00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,625
You know, there is one thing

00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:44,063
that comes in and goes
out of here all the time.

00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,803
Cold air.

00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,379
Anything?

00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:03,515
Just black P.E.T.,
as far as the eye can see.

00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:07,853
And a possible transfer.

00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:11,423
BROWN:
<i>Where were you last night?</i>

00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,425
Right here, man.

00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:16,929
I'm going to need
to see your hands.

00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:20,375
Dad?

00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:22,544
Trav, go to your room.

00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:29,784
Other side.

00:33:37,834 --> 00:33:39,291
Look, you went there too.

00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:41,660
That's how I knew where to go.

00:33:41,727 --> 00:33:43,250
But I never touched the guy.

00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,385
He didn't kill your daughter!

00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:48,667
If he's guilty, we're
going to put him away.

00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:49,768
Yeah, yeah.

00:33:49,835 --> 00:33:50,542
And then what?

00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,177
Lawyers? Trial?

00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:56,081
You wait ten years for somebody
else's definition of justice.

00:33:56,148 --> 00:33:57,649
And they always put
the criminal's rights

00:33:57,716 --> 00:33:58,291
before the victim's.

00:33:58,291 --> 00:33:59,726
The first good night's
sleep I had

00:33:59,792 --> 00:34:00,727
was last night.

00:34:00,793 --> 00:34:02,333
Eye for an eye

00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:04,268
and the whole world
goes blind?

00:34:04,335 --> 00:34:05,903
You taught me that.

00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,705
My perspective has changed.

00:34:07,771 --> 00:34:09,573
Aimee's dead.

00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:13,811
I've got no choice here.

00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:15,346
My hands are tied.

00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:19,316
I got to let them
bring you in.

00:34:37,134 --> 00:34:39,036
It's going to be okay, Trav.

00:34:39,103 --> 00:34:41,038
I love you, son.

00:34:41,105 --> 00:34:42,840
Look, uh...

00:34:42,907 --> 00:34:44,742
make sure they take care
of him, all right?

00:34:44,808 --> 00:34:46,143
Of course.

00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,711
All right.

00:34:58,522 --> 00:34:59,590
OFFICER:
Sir.

00:34:59,657 --> 00:35:03,060
You, um, asked us to check
on a stolen minivan?

00:35:03,127 --> 00:35:04,061
Yeah.

00:35:04,128 --> 00:35:05,162
You know,
from the rec center?

00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:07,031
We located it.

00:35:07,097 --> 00:35:09,633
Great, thanks.

00:35:16,774 --> 00:35:17,775
Hey.

00:35:37,361 --> 00:35:39,897
Blue paint transfer.

00:35:39,964 --> 00:35:43,300
Possibly from
your mailbox?

00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,985
I found a jammed
nine millimeter cartridge

00:35:46,052 --> 00:35:47,820
in the backyard of a house
a few doors down

00:35:47,887 --> 00:35:49,622
from where Jaycobs said
he found the gun.

00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,991
Backyard of a house
that had been broken into.

00:35:52,058 --> 00:35:53,625
You said he was a thief, right?

00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:54,593
Yeah.

00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:56,294
See, I think he
lied about where
he found the gun

00:35:56,361 --> 00:35:58,463
so we wouldn't know he was
breaking into houses.

00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,765
Apart from that, I think
he was telling the truth.

00:36:00,832 --> 00:36:01,967
( <i>glass breaking</i> )

00:36:12,377 --> 00:36:13,778
Shall we?

00:36:42,107 --> 00:36:43,108
Grissom.

00:36:44,176 --> 00:36:45,243
Matt used to have

00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:48,947
this really harsh rule
about no eating in the van.

00:36:53,451 --> 00:36:54,419

00:36:54,486 --> 00:36:55,787

Hugo Karlin?

00:36:58,056 --> 00:36:59,959
Yeah, uh, you know what?

00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:01,333
You guys aren't
supposed to be back here.

Detective Vega.
LVPD.

00:37:04,403 --> 00:37:05,938
This is Nick Stokes
from the crime lab.

00:37:06,004 --> 00:37:09,675
Uh, hey.

00:37:09,741 --> 00:37:11,777
What's up?

00:37:11,844 --> 00:37:13,745
Interesting
choice of words.

00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:16,542
Facility management
says you've been

00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:17,417
working on the
air conditioning

00:37:17,417 --> 00:37:18,685
above HyperTrix.

00:37:18,752 --> 00:37:21,154
Yeah, well, I work
this whole building.

00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:23,090
That's a lot
of companies.

00:37:23,156 --> 00:37:24,491
I don't really keep
track of the names,

00:37:24,558 --> 00:37:25,492
I just fix the air.

00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:26,526
You'd remember
this company.

00:37:26,593 --> 00:37:29,429
It's where you
killed a guy...

00:37:29,496 --> 00:37:30,764
with that.

00:37:41,642 --> 00:37:43,210
One in a million shot.

00:37:43,277 --> 00:37:45,312
It happens.

00:37:46,713 --> 00:37:48,382
It was an accident.
You got to believe me.

00:37:48,448 --> 00:37:50,551
I, I always keep
my hammer right here.

00:37:50,617 --> 00:37:52,019
I don't even know
how it came loose.

00:37:52,085 --> 00:37:53,120
Oh, it just
came loose, huh?

00:37:53,186 --> 00:37:54,688
Yes.
Okay.

00:37:54,755 --> 00:37:55,889
Well, then how'd
you pick it up?

00:37:57,391 --> 00:38:02,229
Um, the same way
I close the duct cover.

00:38:07,367 --> 00:38:10,270
I call this my grabby tool.

00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:25,385
I made it myself.

00:38:25,452 --> 00:38:27,187
You know, people never
notice me

00:38:27,254 --> 00:38:28,455
when I'm around here,

00:38:28,522 --> 00:38:31,592
and I just figured that if

00:38:31,658 --> 00:38:33,460
I covered my tracks,
this time

00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:35,996
wouldn't be any different.

00:38:37,864 --> 00:38:41,835
Why don't you, uh,
show him our grabby tool?

00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,003
You're under arrest.

00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,305
You have the right
to remain silent...

How many licks
does it take

00:39:04,157 --> 00:39:06,159
to get to the center
of a Tootsie Pop?

00:39:06,226 --> 00:39:07,661
The world
may never know.

( <i>giggling</i> )

00:39:08,762 --> 00:39:10,063
Just see if you
can get some DNA

00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,298
off of this stick,
would you?

00:39:11,365 --> 00:39:14,434
All work and no play
make Greg a dull boy.

00:39:14,501 --> 00:39:16,637
All play and no work
make Greg an unemployed boy.

00:39:16,703 --> 00:39:17,638
WOMAN:
Hey, Grissom.

00:39:17,704 --> 00:39:19,439
Your stovepipe.

00:39:24,244 --> 00:39:25,245
Pulled a good thumbprint.

00:39:25,312 --> 00:39:26,380
Happens sometimes

00:39:26,446 --> 00:39:28,348
when they load
the magazine.

00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,719
Tyrel Constantine.

00:39:32,786 --> 00:39:35,389
Arrested last June
for joyriding.

00:39:35,455 --> 00:39:38,025
Date of birth '87?

00:39:38,091 --> 00:39:40,561
This guy's a juvie.
He's only 15.

00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:48,001
So, Tyrel, let me
get this straight.

00:39:48,068 --> 00:39:49,603
You didn't know
Jason Gilbert?

00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,538
I never heard of him.

00:39:51,605 --> 00:39:53,907
So you shot someone
you didn't know?

00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,676
Who says I shot anyone?

00:39:55,742 --> 00:39:56,977
That would be me.

00:39:58,645 --> 00:40:01,582
Tyrel Constantine.

00:40:01,648 --> 00:40:03,717
Oh, yeah, I knew him.

00:40:03,784 --> 00:40:06,753
He used to hang out
at the rec center.

00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,988
He used to?

00:40:08,055 --> 00:40:10,057
Until he lost
his privileges.

00:40:10,123 --> 00:40:12,693
So you threw him out?

00:40:12,759 --> 00:40:15,929
He was smoking weed
on the field.

00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:20,100
Showing up late to practice,
starting fights.

00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,035
When did this happen?

00:40:22,102 --> 00:40:24,304
A couple weeks ago.

00:40:24,371 --> 00:40:26,940
We found your saliva
on this lollipop stick

00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:29,776
in Mr. Phelps's van, and
we found your thumbprint

00:40:29,843 --> 00:40:31,211
on this bullet.

00:40:31,278 --> 00:40:33,814
BRASS:
You stole a van
from the rec center,

00:40:33,881 --> 00:40:35,482
didn't you?

00:40:35,549 --> 00:40:38,585
The van wasn't hot-wired,
so I think you knew

00:40:38,652 --> 00:40:40,454
where Mr. Phelps
kept his keys.

00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,223
Why, why, why you asking me
about Tyrel?

00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:47,961
The vehicle that was used
in that drive-by

00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,631
was the van that was stolen
from your rec center.

00:41:04,144 --> 00:41:06,847
Oh, God.

00:41:06,914 --> 00:41:09,149
Look, we know you didn't
mean to shoot anyone.

00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:12,125
It was a stray bullet
that hit Aimee Phelps.

00:41:14,354 --> 00:41:16,423
I just wanted to scare him.

00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:17,958
Scare who?

00:41:18,025 --> 00:41:19,493
Jason Gilbert?

00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,762
No. Mr. Phelps.

00:41:21,828 --> 00:41:22,963
That's it, we're done here.

00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,765
No, wait, Tyrel, wait.

00:41:24,831 --> 00:41:26,700
They need to know
it was an accident.

00:41:26,767 --> 00:41:28,702
He shouldn't have
thrown me out.

00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:32,372
Pushed me around like that
in front of my friends.

00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:34,708
I just wanted to shake him up.

00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:44,318
So Jason Gilbert
was just collateral damage.

00:41:44,384 --> 00:41:48,488
I was driving pretty fast,
didn't look where I shot.

00:41:53,493 --> 00:41:55,195
What about Aimee?

00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,675
I gave up on him.

00:42:08,742 --> 00:42:10,677
If I hadn't...

00:42:10,744 --> 00:42:13,647
He gave up on himself.

00:42:29,496 --> 00:42:32,132
I blew it.

00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:34,768
Yeah.

00:42:34,835 --> 00:42:38,417
But you're not the one
who's paying for it.
