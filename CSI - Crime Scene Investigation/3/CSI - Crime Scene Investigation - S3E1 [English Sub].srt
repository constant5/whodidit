that I don't got?

00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,433
There was tetrahydrozoline
in the victim's drink.

00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:25,001
Uh, I never got my answer.

00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:27,370

with <i>eyedrops?</i>

00:10:38,047 --> 00:10:39,482
Well, it's not
that far-fetched.

00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:42,118
Tetrahydrozoline is the active
ingredient in eye drops.

00:10:42,185 --> 00:10:43,319
It's a vasoconstrictor.

00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:45,355
Obviously, it's great
for bloodshot eyes.

00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:50,460
I can buy that:
you ingest eyedrops

00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:53,663
it constricts the blood vessels
throughout your body

00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,865
maybe even spike
your blood pressure

00:10:55,932 --> 00:10:57,567
perhaps even cause a stroke.

00:10:57,634 --> 00:10:58,568
It's a perfect poison.

00:10:58,635 --> 00:10:59,769

00:11:03,673 --> 00:11:05,275

00:11:09,145 --> 00:11:11,447
So...

00:11:11,514 --> 00:11:14,250
how'd the eyedrops
get into his drink?

00:11:16,853 --> 00:11:18,388
Hey, Catherine.

His prints are in AFIS.

Your turn.

00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:33,136
Cause of death:

00:11:33,202 --> 00:11:35,838
perforating gunshot wound
through and through.

00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:37,874
Wound penetrated
the zygomatic arch

exited the right
temple.

00:11:42,445 --> 00:11:44,581
Check out his right eardrum.

00:11:52,522 --> 00:11:54,390
His eardrum's gone.

00:11:54,457 --> 00:11:57,527
Presence of blood indicates
the tympanic membrane

00:11:57,594 --> 00:11:59,762
was blown out shortly
before death.

00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:02,899
We found him on an airstrip.

00:12:02,966 --> 00:12:05,568
Maybe he was too close
to a jet engine.

00:12:05,635 --> 00:12:09,005
Jet engine? Well, that would
explain his clothing.

00:12:09,072 --> 00:12:11,674
A gasoline smell.
Sent if off to Trace.

00:12:16,546 --> 00:12:18,548
Two symmetrical lines.

00:12:18,615 --> 00:12:22,652
Looks like it could be
from a harness or a seat belt.

Mm-hmm.

00:13:20,577 --> 00:13:23,246
Yeah, I've got fresh marks

00:13:23,313 --> 00:13:25,048

00:13:25,114 --> 00:13:27,116
My guess is one car

00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:28,851
Man, you are way ahead of me.

00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:35,525
Right.

00:13:35,592 --> 00:13:37,227
And you only lay down treads

about 20% oxygen.

lead poisoning

00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,514
from a bullet
that was left in his leg.

00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,882
Tox is pending.

00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,383
But what you're thinking is

00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,052
the lead from the bullet
made his brain swell up

00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,487
with... uncal herniation?

00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,822
Wild card
was blood pressure.

00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,190
If he kept that
under control

00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,825
he might have had
another 20 years.

00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,828
Except that someone put
tetrahydrozoline in his drink

00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,797
which made
his blood pressure spike

00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,799
and now we got his brain
in a bowl.

00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,133
Yup.

00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,969
Nasty.

00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,638
( <i>saw whirring</i> )

00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:33,939
Michelangelo?

00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,140
Yup.

00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,810
It's an odd name
for a mechanic.

00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,345
Well, Thumpy G said
he was an artist.

00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,381
Michael... Angelo.

00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:43,782
Nick Stokes,
Catherine Willows.

00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,017
Vegas Crime Lab.

00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:47,820
Wow.

00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,254
Yeah.

00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,156
So how long
you been racing cars?

00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,758
I don't race 'em.
I soup 'em.

00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:55,160
And at 650 an hour,
you're costing me money.

00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,162
And you're costing us time.

00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,464
We're investigating a murder.

00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,332
Jace Felder, right?

00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,533
That's right.

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,001
How do you know?

00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,203
Small world.

00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,471
Shame about what happened.

00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,706
He was the Steve McQueen
of Southern Nevada.

00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,174
We're looking
for the kid he raced

00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,743
the night he was shot.

00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,177
Why come to me?

00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,346
Thumpy G dropped your name, man.

00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,715
Said he was driving
a "Michelangelo."

00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,184
I have <i>many</i> works of art.

00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,452
Which one?

00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,989
A blue Honda, blue rims,
tinted windows.

00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:31,897
Works of art.

00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,567
MICHELANGELO:
Billie Holiday.

00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,936
Built this baby for myself.

00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,038
Sold it to some punk kid.

00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,440
Never should
have done that.

00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:42,808
Sold out.

00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,143
Kid walks in one day

00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,211
$100,000 price tag in his head.

00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,614
Wants a racer
off the showroom floor.

00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,850
No custom, no waiting,
right now.

00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,252
Paid by check.

00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:54,253
Silver spoon kid.

00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,487
You got a copy of the check?

00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:56,522
Tossed it.

00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,523
Tossed it?

00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,792
Never should have done that,
either.

00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:00,926
No.

00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,061
All I know was, it was
an insurance company check.

00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,263
Third party.

00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:05,798
Sat on it till it cleared.

00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:08,100
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:09,435
Yeah?

00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:10,903
LOCKWOOD:
Found Jace Felder's car.

00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,171
Where?

00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,338
Yeah, we were lucky.

00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,807
It was right under our noses.

00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:17,076
Uniform found it out
on Gibson Road.

00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:18,444
Tent sale.

00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,712
The, uh, VIN number
was scratched off

00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,014
but I ran the firewall.

00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:24,016
Came back Jace Felder.

00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,017
Who's the seller?

00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:26,018
Uh, some guy named

00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:27,419
Steven Masters.

00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:28,954
Well, make him an offer.

00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,657
We'll take the car.

00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:35,227
So, we meet again.

00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,430
Lita Gibbons wasn't putting this
on her nipples, was she?

00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,566
You have been drinking
too many Thug Passions.

00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,934
The woman is twice your age.

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,001
She may be three times

00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,203
your age, Greg.

00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,637
Old case. Sorry.

00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,806
( <i>printer whirring</i> )

00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,315
Well?

00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:59,818
Well, uh, you'll get your answer
when I get mine.

00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:03,222
Hey, Grissom.

00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:06,191
Hooked you up.

00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,494
Is this the same color
as the contact lens?

00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,828
Only bigger.

00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,864
Glass is my life.

00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,165
All right, stick around.

00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:14,366
I need your eyes.

00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,802
As long as they stay in my head.

00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,707
Find the aces.

00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:23,776
How many are there?

00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,246
Four.

00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,921
First row, third card.

00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:40,759
Second row, fourth card.

00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:48,333
Third row, eighth card.

00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:53,405
And, fourth row, third card.

00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,441
Anaglyphics.

00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,910
Color contrast
to see hidden marks.

00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,412
Lita Gibbons was
playing the daub.

00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,681
She was cheating.

00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,542
She marked the cards with lip balm.

00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:06,583
And that's all she was doing.

00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:10,789
The victim's drink contained
.05% tetrahydrozoline hydrocholoride

00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:13,158
<i>and</i> .25% zinc sulfate.

00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,426
There was no zinc sulfate

00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,161
in any of Lita Gibbons'
eyedrops.

00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,696
It's a different
formulation.

00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,765
So she didn't kill
Doyle Pfeiffer.

00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:22,367
No. <i>But</i> someone's eyedrops did.

00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:30,378
You're costing me money, here.
I've got a second shift
at the Monaco.

00:23:30,445 --> 00:23:32,580
Well, you didn't seem
too worried about money
the other night.

00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:34,315
We watched
the surveillance tape.

00:23:34,382 --> 00:23:37,118
Doyle Pfeiffer didn't even
pass you a nickel

00:23:37,185 --> 00:23:38,520
yet you were
all over him.

00:23:38,586 --> 00:23:40,321
I can tell
you've never served drinks.

00:23:40,388 --> 00:23:42,724
Catch him in
the right mood

00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:43,725
with the right pot

00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:45,393
he can make your month.

00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,062
Is that why you were giving eyes
to the California kid?

00:23:48,129 --> 00:23:49,931
I wasn't making eyes with him.

00:23:49,998 --> 00:23:52,767
You tipped some waitress
$1,500 the other night?

00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:55,069
You in business,
or you in love?

00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,439
I was running a hot streak,
three kill pots in a row.

00:23:57,505 --> 00:23:59,407
60 grand in 40 minutes--
I threw her a bone.

00:23:59,474 --> 00:24:00,742
That all you threw her?

00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:01,743
Put a shot in her?

00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,278
Anything else
I should know?

00:24:03,344 --> 00:24:04,846
I mean,
we're just talking here.

00:24:04,913 --> 00:24:07,315
All I can say is
for 1,500 bucks

00:24:07,382 --> 00:24:09,317
you get great service.

00:24:09,384 --> 00:24:11,920
I'm a waitress,
not a call girl.

00:24:11,986 --> 00:24:13,555
I was playing one guy
against the other.

00:24:13,621 --> 00:24:14,556
You want to make money?

00:24:14,622 --> 00:24:16,591
You bait.

00:24:16,658 --> 00:24:18,293
Besides...

00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:20,228
I thought Doyle
had a heart attack.

00:24:20,295 --> 00:24:21,830
He did, but he had help.

00:24:21,896 --> 00:24:24,232
Someone put something
in his drink.

00:24:37,345 --> 00:24:38,279
What can I get you?

00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:40,048
I'd like some information.

00:24:40,115 --> 00:24:43,284
Do you know what happens
when you beat a legend?

00:24:43,351 --> 00:24:44,986
People see you different.

00:24:45,053 --> 00:24:47,021
They-they play you different.

00:24:47,088 --> 00:24:48,667
I wanted that edge.

00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,225
All right,
let's go with that-- an edge.

00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,727
It does not play
into my hand to
have the guy dead.

00:24:54,229 --> 00:24:55,430
The days of comping drinks

00:24:55,497 --> 00:24:57,165
sticking the hotel
with the bill,
those are done.

00:24:57,232 --> 00:24:58,099
Everything's
computerized

00:24:58,166 --> 00:24:59,601
down to the last drop.

00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:00,835
Standard protocol.

00:25:00,902 --> 00:25:02,837
Down to the way
the girls order
their drinks:

00:25:02,904 --> 00:25:05,874
sodas first, mixers second,
beers last. No exceptions.

00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,109
Where's your alcohol?

00:25:08,176 --> 00:25:09,844
I don't see any bottles.

00:25:09,911 --> 00:25:10,945
Back of the house.

00:25:11,012 --> 00:25:13,848
Really?

00:25:13,915 --> 00:25:16,284
May I order a double bourbon
on the rocks?

00:25:16,351 --> 00:25:17,185
Coming up.

00:25:36,905 --> 00:25:37,939
Eight dollars.

00:25:38,006 --> 00:25:42,377
You keep the drink
and the change.
Thank you.

00:25:42,444 --> 00:25:44,345
You mind if I take a look
in your purse?

00:25:44,412 --> 00:25:45,447
Yes, I do mind.

00:25:46,915 --> 00:25:47,916
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:25:47,982 --> 00:25:50,051
( <i>zipper opening</i> )

00:25:50,118 --> 00:25:51,386
I'll tell you this.

00:25:51,453 --> 00:25:54,155
You bust me...

00:25:54,222 --> 00:25:56,157
you better bust all of us.

00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,802
WILLOWS:
No glass

00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:10,333
no paint flecks,
no personal effects.

00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:11,767
It's been cleaned.

00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:13,708
Hold the phone.

00:26:15,271 --> 00:26:17,874
I've got what looks like...

00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,775
Ah.

00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,668
...a nine-millimeter round.

00:26:22,734 --> 00:26:25,792
No visible body fluid. What do you think?

00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:26,672
Maybe a miss?

00:26:26,738 --> 00:26:28,106
Well, if he was
shot in this car

00:26:28,173 --> 00:26:29,408
there's got to
be some blood.

00:26:29,475 --> 00:26:32,811
Spray it up.

00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:46,095
Well, the only void
is in the driver's seat.

00:26:46,162 --> 00:26:48,264
Means it was occupied
by our victim, Jace Felder.

00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:50,600
So he was shot in the head,
left to right.

00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:53,636
Spatter on the passenger door
is from the exit wound.

00:26:53,703 --> 00:26:56,038
Well, what about
the rest of this blood?

00:26:56,105 --> 00:26:57,206
It's everywhere.

00:26:57,273 --> 00:27:00,576
He was shot while the car
was in motion?

00:27:00,643 --> 00:27:02,612
Bled out while the
car was rolling?

00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,415
I want to meet this seller.

00:27:06,482 --> 00:27:07,984
Opportunity knocked.

00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,752
I answered.

00:27:09,819 --> 00:27:10,753
STOKES:
Okay.

00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,989
Uh, let's back up
and start over

00:27:13,055 --> 00:27:14,657
shall we, Mr. Masters?

00:27:14,724 --> 00:27:16,492
You and your brother
were off-roading.

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,893
Yes, sir.

00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,796
And you stumbled upon a wrecked
racer out near Mercury.

00:27:20,863 --> 00:27:21,998
Yes, sir.

00:27:22,064 --> 00:27:23,332
Why didn't you just...?

00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:24,400
Wait a minute.

00:27:24,467 --> 00:27:26,002
Let me, uh,
let me get in on this.

00:27:26,068 --> 00:27:27,503
Please.

00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,904
What were you thinking?

00:27:28,971 --> 00:27:30,239
You-you took the car?

00:27:30,306 --> 00:27:31,507
Damn right.

00:27:31,574 --> 00:27:33,943
Engine alone's
worth 15 grand.

00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,545
The keys are still
in the ignition.
See if it runs.

00:27:36,612 --> 00:27:38,581
What about him?

00:27:38,648 --> 00:27:39,749
L-Leave him here.

00:27:39,815 --> 00:27:43,152
And what does
a person's life go for?

00:27:43,219 --> 00:27:45,488
Ma'am, he was already dead.

00:27:45,554 --> 00:27:47,490
I drove the car home,
washed it out.

00:27:47,556 --> 00:27:50,826
And you didn't think to call 911
or anything like that?

00:27:50,893 --> 00:27:53,362
No. You guys would have
impounded the car.

00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:55,298
Okay, Mr. Masters.

00:27:55,364 --> 00:27:57,833
You've just confessed
to grand larceny.

00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,101
Tampering
with a crime scene.

00:27:59,168 --> 00:28:00,836
Detective Lockwood
will get back to you

00:28:00,903 --> 00:28:01,904
on the murder charge.

00:28:06,542 --> 00:28:08,277
Make yourself at home, boss.

00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:11,814
Jackass.

00:28:11,881 --> 00:28:12,982
Dumbass.

00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:14,150
"Opportunity knocked."

00:28:14,216 --> 00:28:15,151
LOCKWOOD:
Hey, guys.

00:28:15,217 --> 00:28:16,752
I got a name
on that third-party check

00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:17,987
signed over to Michelangelo.

00:28:18,054 --> 00:28:20,990
Tony Del Nagro.
8824 Sandy Creek Road.

00:28:21,057 --> 00:28:23,492
Yeah. I race.

00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:25,027
You race Jace Felder
the other night?

00:28:25,094 --> 00:28:26,329
I race a lot of people.

00:28:26,395 --> 00:28:27,597
Look,
if you're looking

00:28:27,663 --> 00:28:28,864
to bust my son
for street-racing

00:28:28,931 --> 00:28:31,067
you can get your partner
out of my backyard. I mean...

00:28:31,133 --> 00:28:32,501
Sir, we're investigating
a murder.

00:28:32,568 --> 00:28:33,903
Jace Felder was shot and killed.

00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:36,439
He doesn't know anything
about that.

00:28:36,505 --> 00:28:38,341
Tony...

00:28:38,407 --> 00:28:40,676
tell me about
the race.

00:28:40,743 --> 00:28:42,111
We went head up.

00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,918
Put my pink slip up
against his five grand.

00:28:48,985 --> 00:28:50,987
Guess you could say
I won.

00:28:58,861 --> 00:29:03,699
This looks new--
light glass, tinted glass.

00:29:16,779 --> 00:29:20,116
From what I hear,
Jace Felder was...

00:29:20,182 --> 00:29:21,851
Mario Andretti.

00:29:21,917 --> 00:29:22,852
Why would you...?

00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:24,020
( <i>door opens</i> )

00:29:26,455 --> 00:29:27,957
Why would you risk

00:29:28,024 --> 00:29:30,393
your "Michelangelo"
against the best?

00:29:30,459 --> 00:29:31,794
The best?

00:29:31,861 --> 00:29:34,196
Yeah, right.

00:29:34,263 --> 00:29:37,166
Jace was nothing
but a lip-flapper.

00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:40,136
Told me I was all flash
and no dash.

00:29:40,202 --> 00:29:42,838
He wanted to nut up a title.
I took it.

00:29:44,507 --> 00:29:46,342
( <i>peeling</i> )

00:29:50,146 --> 00:29:51,814
Everybody scattered.

00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:52,982
No one wants to be there

00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:54,450
when the cops show up.

00:29:54,517 --> 00:29:57,787
Did you replace one of your
car windows recently?

00:29:57,853 --> 00:29:58,854
Yeah.

00:29:58,921 --> 00:29:59,855
Last week.

00:29:59,922 --> 00:30:01,157
Some tweeker
blew it out

00:30:01,223 --> 00:30:02,325
doing donuts.

00:30:02,391 --> 00:30:04,460
Before or after you fired
the gun in your car?

00:30:04,527 --> 00:30:05,962
All right

00:30:06,028 --> 00:30:07,363
what is this all about?

00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,464
I mean, look,
my son doesn't have

00:30:08,531 --> 00:30:09,999
to answer any more
of your questions.

00:30:10,066 --> 00:30:11,000
Dad, it's okay.

00:30:11,067 --> 00:30:12,068
It's fine.

00:30:15,338 --> 00:30:18,608
Yeah, I popped off a few rounds
through the sunroof.

00:30:18,674 --> 00:30:20,042
The sunroof?

00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,210
Yeah, everybody does it.

00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,812
Music's bumpin'
and everybody's

00:30:22,878 --> 00:30:24,380
showing off
their wheels.

00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:25,047
You get hyped
for a race.

00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,349
Everybody does it.

00:30:26,415 --> 00:30:27,783
Where's the gun, Tony?

00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,987
It's not his; it's mine.

00:30:31,053 --> 00:30:32,188
It doesn't belong to him.

00:30:32,255 --> 00:30:34,190
It's registered to me.

00:30:34,257 --> 00:30:35,391
Well, sir, we have reason
to believe this gun

00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,392
was used in a homicide.

00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:39,228
Well, <i>sir...</i>

00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:42,565
my wife was murdered
two years ago

00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:46,068
and I couldn't even get a cop
to return my phone calls

00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,670
and now here you are

00:30:47,737 --> 00:30:49,171
in my home

00:30:49,238 --> 00:30:51,340
harassing my son.

00:30:52,942 --> 00:30:54,577
Get out.

00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,746
Now. Take a walk.

00:30:59,982 --> 00:31:01,951
We'll be back with a warrant.

00:31:08,257 --> 00:31:09,325
What do cowboys drink?

00:31:09,392 --> 00:31:10,326
Whiskey.

00:31:10,393 --> 00:31:11,694
And when I chew
on a lemon wedge

00:31:11,761 --> 00:31:12,695
boy, is it...

00:31:12,762 --> 00:31:14,030
Sour.

00:31:14,096 --> 00:31:16,899
And vacuums are great
because they... suck.

00:31:16,966 --> 00:31:18,634
Reverse suction.

00:31:22,271 --> 00:31:27,143
His drink in her eyedrops;
her eyedrops in his drinks.

00:31:27,209 --> 00:31:29,011
Dr. Edmund Locard
would be proud.

00:31:29,078 --> 00:31:30,613
Well, we got
a bonded bartender

00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,381
eye in the sky,
other waitresses.

00:31:32,448 --> 00:31:34,717
How the hell did she get that
into his drink

00:31:34,784 --> 00:31:36,052
without anyone seeing?

00:31:36,118 --> 00:31:38,754
Aye. There's the rub.

00:31:38,821 --> 00:31:41,824
( <i>Mozart opera playing</i> )

00:32:12,488 --> 00:32:13,789
What do you got?

00:32:13,856 --> 00:32:16,692
Suspicious waitress.

00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:19,195
Standard protocol
for ordering drinks--

00:32:19,262 --> 00:32:21,697
the sodas, then mixed drinks,
then beers.

00:32:21,764 --> 00:32:24,634
First five rounds,
she ordered correctly.

00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,402
The last round, however

00:32:26,469 --> 00:32:29,171
she ordered Doyle's
whiskey sour first.

00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,640
You can't pin this on me.

00:32:30,706 --> 00:32:32,041
Sure, we can.

00:32:32,108 --> 00:32:35,011
You put your eyedrops
in Doyle Pfeiffer's drink.

00:32:35,077 --> 00:32:36,512
That's what killed him.

00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,714
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
My eyedrops?

00:32:38,781 --> 00:32:40,349
Look, you saw the way
it works.

00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,350
I didn't have time.

00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,418
You made the time.

00:32:42,485 --> 00:32:44,353
Whiskey sour, decaf,
bottled water, beer.

00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,856
Come on, Nadine.
Order your drinks
in the right order, okay?

00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,858
I'm swamped.
Just give them to me.
I am, too.

00:32:52,561 --> 00:32:55,064
You changed the order
of your drinks

00:32:55,131 --> 00:32:57,233
and the switch-up gave you...

00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,635
opportunity.

00:32:59,702 --> 00:33:01,137
So, let's talk motive.

00:33:01,203 --> 00:33:02,672
You want motive?

00:33:02,738 --> 00:33:03,506
Yes.

00:33:03,572 --> 00:33:04,974
He was a stiff.

00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:07,343
I gave him
a standard eyedrop shooter.

00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,512
I was trying to give the guy
diarrhea, not kill him.

00:33:09,578 --> 00:33:11,547
Doyle sat at my table
night after night

00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,416
and never so much
as even tosses me

00:33:13,482 --> 00:33:15,484
one of those
piddly-ass candies of his?

00:33:15,551 --> 00:33:17,853
In my line of work, there are
two kinds of tippers:

00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,355
the "Georges" and the "stiffs."

00:33:19,422 --> 00:33:21,357
Matt was a George;
Doyle was a stiff.

00:33:21,424 --> 00:33:22,959
Now, if you want
to charge me

00:33:23,025 --> 00:33:24,727
with conspiracy of trying
to make a guy crap his pants

00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,529
then fine, go ahead.

00:33:26,596 --> 00:33:27,863
I'm guilty.

00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:30,866
But I didn't kill him.

00:33:30,933 --> 00:33:32,034
So, the kid gets the pot

00:33:32,101 --> 00:33:33,703
but he doesn't get
the reputation.

00:33:33,769 --> 00:33:35,037
Server's revenge.

00:33:35,104 --> 00:33:36,172
Yeah, that's what she said.

00:33:36,238 --> 00:33:38,507
A pissed-off waitress and a
rounder with a bullet in him

00:33:38,574 --> 00:33:39,875
it could be a
lethal combination.

00:33:39,942 --> 00:33:42,845
Got that tox
report back.

00:33:47,717 --> 00:33:50,219
Basophillic stippling?

00:33:50,286 --> 00:33:51,487
Well, that can't be.

00:33:51,554 --> 00:33:52,955
Coarse basophillic stippling
only occurs

00:33:53,022 --> 00:33:54,390
from massive
infusions of lead.

00:33:54,457 --> 00:33:56,158
Yeah, and according
to the tox report

00:33:56,225 --> 00:33:57,593
the bullet in his leg
wasn't degraded enough

00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,161
to account for the amount
of lead in his body.

00:33:59,228 --> 00:34:01,664
So where'd the rest of the lead
come from?

00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:05,792
STOKES:
What do you got, Bobby?

00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:07,194
Yo, got your bullet.

00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,895
She pulled this
out of a CRX, huh?

00:34:08,962 --> 00:34:09,896
Yeah.

00:34:09,963 --> 00:34:11,298
Well, it's a lead core
of a bullet.

00:34:11,364 --> 00:34:12,299
Looks like a...

00:34:12,365 --> 00:34:14,801
medium caliber,
just mangled upon impact.

00:34:14,868 --> 00:34:16,036
Can't get any stria,
so, uh...

00:34:16,102 --> 00:34:18,238
test firing the suspect's
weapon's a waste of time.

00:34:18,305 --> 00:34:19,239
Great, so it's useless.

00:34:19,306 --> 00:34:20,073
Well, I don't know.

00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,441
Take a look at the tip there.

00:34:22,742 --> 00:34:25,011
Bullet's
got splinters.

00:34:25,078 --> 00:34:29,182
Light glass, tinted glass.

00:34:29,249 --> 00:34:30,083
Thanks, Bobby.

00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,084
Yeah, sure thing.

00:34:31,151 --> 00:34:33,153
GRISSOM:
Okay, the last hand.

00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,621
I'm Doyle,
I've been sitting

00:34:34,688 --> 00:34:36,423
in the same chair
for 13 hours.

00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:38,425
Here comes
the cocktail waitress.

00:34:38,492 --> 00:34:39,826
She serves me
my drink.

00:34:39,893 --> 00:34:41,361
Flashes me

00:34:41,428 --> 00:34:43,029
then she looks at Matt.

00:34:43,096 --> 00:34:45,332
Question is, why?

00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:47,267
Let's not forget
the eyedrops are already

00:34:47,334 --> 00:34:49,302
in the drink; maybe she's
giving him a signal.

00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:50,871
Yeah, maybe they're
working together.

00:34:50,937 --> 00:34:52,873
It's irrelevant. We've been
chasing eyedrops to death.

00:34:52,939 --> 00:34:54,174
We're looking for lead.

00:34:54,241 --> 00:34:56,309
SANDERS:
Well, maybe the lead
came from the glasses.

00:34:56,376 --> 00:34:57,477
Lead crystal.

00:34:57,544 --> 00:34:59,179
Yeah, in a casino?
Picture that.

00:34:59,246 --> 00:35:01,748
SIDLE:
Already tested them.
Negative.

00:35:07,888 --> 00:35:09,556
WILLOWS:
<i>So, I looked into</i>

00:35:09,623 --> 00:35:10,790
Rita Del Nagro's death.

00:35:10,857 --> 00:35:12,425
The accident report
says hit-and-run.

00:35:12,492 --> 00:35:14,728
It was a two-car collision.
It's still open.

00:35:14,794 --> 00:35:17,264
An arrest was made,
but the suspect was released

00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,698
due to insufficient evidence.

00:35:18,765 --> 00:35:20,167
Now, guess his name.

00:35:20,233 --> 00:35:21,902
Jace Felder?

00:35:21,968 --> 00:35:23,336
Gives Tony Del Nagro

00:35:23,403 --> 00:35:25,071
plenty of motive.

00:35:25,138 --> 00:35:26,840
He lost his mother.

00:35:26,907 --> 00:35:27,841
Wanted revenge.

00:35:27,908 --> 00:35:29,176
Maybe, but why try
to gun down Felder

00:35:29,242 --> 00:35:30,310
in the middle
of a street race?

00:35:30,377 --> 00:35:31,711
Well, if it looks
like an accident

00:35:31,778 --> 00:35:33,380
the investigation
would be abbreviated.

00:35:33,446 --> 00:35:34,981
All right, stand back, y'all.

00:35:35,048 --> 00:35:36,883
No full-on autopsy

00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,785
the bullet
could go undetected.

00:35:40,487 --> 00:35:41,421
Firing!

00:35:41,488 --> 00:35:43,223
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:35:48,995 --> 00:35:51,598
Bullet's nose picked up
trace of both windows.

00:35:51,665 --> 00:35:54,000
Just like the one recovered
from Jace Felder's car.

00:35:54,067 --> 00:35:55,569
WILLOWS:
You guys rock.

00:35:55,635 --> 00:35:56,570
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:35:56,636 --> 00:35:58,371
So, we know the bullet
can make the shot...

00:36:00,807 --> 00:36:02,709
let's go see
if the driver can.

00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:10,183
Hey, thanks, we'll take care
of them for you.

00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,451
Hey, wait, hang on.

00:36:11,518 --> 00:36:13,854
Cath, give me a test fire,
will you?

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,655
Love to.

00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,625
( <i>alarm sounds</i> )

00:36:21,995 --> 00:36:24,564
I wired the target
to the car's alarm system.

00:36:24,631 --> 00:36:26,766
Gotta make sure
we hear it.

00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:29,169
Always thinking there,
Nicky, aren't ya?

00:36:33,507 --> 00:36:35,242
Okay, remember

00:36:35,308 --> 00:36:37,077
full out the fifth

00:36:37,144 --> 00:36:38,745
then hit the nitrous
and hang on.

00:36:38,812 --> 00:36:40,347
You just try to keep up.

00:36:42,215 --> 00:36:44,351
( <i>engines roaring</i> )

00:36:44,417 --> 00:36:45,785
( <i>tires peeling</i> )

00:37:06,573 --> 00:37:08,875
( <i>alarm sounding</i> )

00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:15,715
( <i>tires screeching</i> )

00:37:18,718 --> 00:37:21,154
( <i>tires peeling</i> )

00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:34,467
Thank you.
Good night!

00:38:26,453 --> 00:38:29,456
Jace killed my mom.

00:38:29,523 --> 00:38:31,758
Everybody knew it.

00:38:31,825 --> 00:38:33,994
Everybody knew it,
and nobody came forward.

00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:37,097
It was a street race.

00:38:42,235 --> 00:38:45,405
Jace's car just slammed
right into us.

00:38:45,472 --> 00:38:47,007
( <i>tires peeling</i> )

00:38:47,073 --> 00:38:50,377
Killed my mom instantly.

00:38:50,443 --> 00:38:52,546
He just plowed right into us.

00:38:52,612 --> 00:38:54,314
Kept going.

00:38:55,615 --> 00:38:56,950
You were in the car.

00:38:57,017 --> 00:38:59,419
Why didn't you
just tell the police?

00:38:59,486 --> 00:39:03,056
Because I didn't know
it was Jace.

00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:07,227
I found out later on
that it was a street racer.

00:39:07,294 --> 00:39:09,629
And you weren't?

00:39:09,696 --> 00:39:11,565
Not at the time, no.

00:39:11,631 --> 00:39:13,867
So I went
to a couple of events

00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:17,237
and hooked into the world.

00:39:17,304 --> 00:39:22,576
I found out within <i>one hour</i>
who killed her.

00:39:22,642 --> 00:39:27,814
So, let me
get this straight.

00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:31,485
You decide to become
one of them.

00:39:31,551 --> 00:39:34,254
You buy a car with your
mother's death benefit

00:39:34,321 --> 00:39:38,525
toss your hat in the ring
and wait for your shot.

00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:46,166
Revenge is best served cold.

00:39:48,134 --> 00:39:49,769
( <i>three gunshots</i> )

00:39:49,836 --> 00:39:50,504
( <i>glass shattering</i> )

00:39:56,343 --> 00:39:57,577
( <i>engine accelerating</i> )

00:39:57,644 --> 00:40:01,748
I never stopped.

00:40:01,815 --> 00:40:04,484
I just kept going.

00:40:04,551 --> 00:40:06,219
Never looked back.

00:40:06,286 --> 00:40:07,787
Took his title

00:40:07,854 --> 00:40:08,622
and then took him down.

00:40:08,688 --> 00:40:12,159
He took my mother's life

00:40:12,225 --> 00:40:14,327
so I took his.

00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,532
BROWN:
What's up, Griss?

00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,402
Did you guys know that 70%
of the world's chocolate

00:40:22,469 --> 00:40:23,803
is produced in West Africa?

00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:24,871
Really?
Yeah.

00:40:24,938 --> 00:40:25,906
The Ivory Coast

00:40:25,972 --> 00:40:28,408
Ghana, Nigeria,
and Cameroon.

00:40:28,475 --> 00:40:30,177
No, I, uh, didn't know that.

00:40:30,243 --> 00:40:31,745
Doyle Pfeiffer
didn't know either.

00:40:31,812 --> 00:40:34,047
Chocolate comes
from cocoa plants

00:40:34,114 --> 00:40:37,884
but in West Africa the cars
still use leaded gas.

00:40:37,951 --> 00:40:41,288
So when the exhaust fumes
disperse into the atmosphere...

00:40:42,455 --> 00:40:47,727
and it rains...
it pours lead.

00:40:47,794 --> 00:40:48,862
Like acid rain.

00:40:48,929 --> 00:40:49,996
Whatever's in
the atmosphere

00:40:50,063 --> 00:40:53,667
gets into the soil
gets into the cocoa plants.

00:40:53,733 --> 00:40:55,669
Capillary action.

00:40:55,735 --> 00:40:58,305
Then the cocoa's harvested,
processed, refined

00:40:58,371 --> 00:41:00,774
sold into bulk,
and eventually...

00:41:00,841 --> 00:41:02,042
Choco-bees.

00:41:04,878 --> 00:41:06,680
Doyle Pfeiffer's nickname
was the "Candyman."

00:41:06,746 --> 00:41:08,048
He got that name

00:41:08,114 --> 00:41:10,350
the night he won
the world championship in '86.

00:41:10,417 --> 00:41:12,118
Well, if he had those
chocolates with him in '86

00:41:12,185 --> 00:41:13,353
he's had them every night since.

00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,387
His lucky charm.

00:41:14,454 --> 00:41:16,656
By my calculations
he might have consumed

00:41:16,723 --> 00:41:19,392
up to a pound of chocolate
a night for 16 years.

00:41:19,459 --> 00:41:20,494
Wow.

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,195
That would explain
all the lead in him.

00:41:22,262 --> 00:41:23,730
Ultimately

00:41:23,797 --> 00:41:25,065
the tetrahydrosoline
in the eyedrops

00:41:25,131 --> 00:41:27,200
triggered it,
but essentially, it was...

00:41:27,267 --> 00:41:30,917
death by chocolate.
