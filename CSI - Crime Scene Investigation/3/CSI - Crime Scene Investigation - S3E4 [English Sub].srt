00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:22,154
Is this some kind
of convention?

00:01:22,221 --> 00:01:23,322
Little people convention.

00:01:23,388 --> 00:01:24,994
Every year they come
from all over the world

00:01:24,994 --> 00:01:26,262
to a designated city.

00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:27,786
Socialize, network.

00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:29,855
It's their prom, Olympics,
and New Year's Eve

00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:30,856
all rolled into one.

00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:32,994
Oh, hey.

00:01:32,994 --> 00:01:34,429
Excuse me.

00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:36,831
Don't think so, square jaw.

00:01:36,898 --> 00:01:38,833
SIDLE:
Grissom, how
do you know this?

00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,369
I get the newsletter.

00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:47,342
BRASS:
Lawrence Ames,
clothing salesman from Phoenix.

00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:51,613
He's 35, four foot,
five inches tall.

00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,781
One of the, uh,
convention organizers

00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:54,782
found him.

00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:56,584
She was checking
out the stage.

00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:57,952
There's a fashion
show tomorrow

00:01:58,019 --> 00:01:59,120
if you're interested.

00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:00,488
She looked up and saw him.

00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:02,123
SIDLE:
Guy does a suicide
in a public place.

00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,911
He was trying to make
a statement.

00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:05,012
Suicide?

00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,447
It's a reasonable
suspicion.

00:02:06,514 --> 00:02:08,616
STOKES:
Suicide among

00:02:08,683 --> 00:02:11,052
any disability group
is above average.

00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:13,087
Being a dwarf doesn't mean
you're disabled, Nick.

00:02:13,154 --> 00:02:14,222
It means you're...
short.

00:02:17,325 --> 00:02:19,260
I think we've got
a little murder.

My favorite CSI.

00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,512
I was hoping you'd
get the call out.

00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:02,214
Look who is back in town.

00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:03,882
So, what happened, Drew?

00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:06,485
You didn't like, uh, Idaho?
Is that it?

00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:07,819
Had everything but you.

00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:09,154
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
Yeah, right.

00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:11,156
So, what do we got?

00:03:11,223 --> 00:03:12,491
One body,
male Caucasian.

00:03:12,557 --> 00:03:14,119
Looks like a home invasion.

00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:15,420
Listen, I'm
headed next door.

00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:16,855
I'm going to talk
to a neighbor

00:03:16,922 --> 00:03:18,256
heard shouting,
called 9-1-1.

00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,424
Keep me posted?

00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,726
Always did.

00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,265
Hi.

00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,767
Willows.

00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,411
Akers.

00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:31,845
You clear the place?

00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:32,846
Just finishing.

00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:35,415
Okay.

00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,417
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:44,925
( <i>groans</i> )

00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:47,828
( <i>cell phone ringing</i> )

00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,363
Yeah?

00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,031
Oh, hey, Warrick.

00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:53,300
Uh, yeah, it's, uh

00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:56,303
some kind of home invasion
gone bad.

00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,638
Don't run any lights.

00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,040
I'll just process
till the coroner gets here.

00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:03,010
Okay. Cool.

00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,012
We were just pulling out
of the chili place

00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,079
when dispatch radio, uh

00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,215
arrived on the scene
at 1900 hours.

00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:10,384
My partner secured
the perimeter.

00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,785
I've been in here...

00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,887
This your first time
on body watch?

00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,555
Well...

00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,191
alive...

00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,060
it's inside your bowels.

00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,895
Dead, it ends up
on the floor.

00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,563
( <i>gagging</i> )

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,432
Go. Go, go, go.
Just get some air.

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,069
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:09,443
( <i>yells</i> )

00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:13,213
Suspect on location!
Suspect on location!

00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,019
( <i>grunts</i> )

00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:20,587
( <i>moaning</i> )

00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,655
Out back.

00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:22,956
Catherine,
what happened?

00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:23,957
He went out back.

00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,393
I'm all right.

00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,794
I'm okay.

00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,937
He must have gotten out
the back window.

00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:43,138
You the first officer
on the scene?

00:05:43,205 --> 00:05:44,661
When you clear a place

00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:45,929
you clear it, do
you understand?

00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:47,063
Yes, sir, I'm sorry.

00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,164
We lost a CSI
two years ago

00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:49,332
because
of the same mistake!

00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,333
Warrick...

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,834
ease up.

00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:53,169
My fault.

00:05:53,236 --> 00:05:54,637
I sent him out.

00:05:54,704 --> 00:05:58,408
Use your radio
and call for backup.

00:06:00,476 --> 00:06:02,478
Hey...

00:06:02,545 --> 00:06:04,480
Hey.

00:06:04,547 --> 00:06:05,815
Are you okay?

00:06:05,882 --> 00:06:08,051
Yeah. I'm all right.

00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:11,454
Don't touch me.

00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:13,456
I'm evidence.

00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,125
I got some fibers here.

00:06:16,192 --> 00:06:18,494
Possibly secondary.

00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:21,731
This rope was
identical to the rope

00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,167
around the victim's neck.

00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:25,235
Wait, David.

00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:27,971
Got a hair in the knot.

00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,542
Killer's in the rope.

00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:34,577
I want to preserve this
as is, so cut higher.

00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,812
Yes, sir.

00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:49,025
Hey, um, hand me a swab,
would you?

00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:52,629
You know I could do this
for you.

00:06:52,695 --> 00:06:58,668
Not going to hurt
any less.

00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:02,138
( <i>groans softly</i> )

00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:03,840
That cut is deep.

00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:10,747
Damn.

00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,219
All right, um,
hey, uh, turn around.

00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:17,153
Huh?

00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,456
Privacy.

00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,958
The guy bodied me full-on.

00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,861
I don't want Trace to miss
one hair or one fiber.

00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:41,210
You decent?

00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:54,524
Looks like we're up.

00:08:14,344 --> 00:08:16,946
These scars are old.

00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:19,482
Tell me this wasn't
bone-lengthening surgery.

00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:22,018
ROBBINS:
Probably done
when he was a teenager.

00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,454
Surgical pins
are inserted into the bone

00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,422
and linked
to an external screw.

00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:28,658
Turn the screw,
it cracks the bones.

00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,326
Osteogenic cells flood in.

00:08:30,393 --> 00:08:32,262
Callus forms
to bridge the gap.

00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:33,429
The fractures heal

00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:36,299
and the bone gets longer.

00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:39,669
You have to break the bones
every four to six hours

00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:41,738
a quarter millimeter
at a time.

00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:44,674
Excruciating pain...

00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:46,075
for an extra few inches.

00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:49,245
What people will endure
to be "normal."

00:08:49,312 --> 00:08:51,648
"What fools these mortals be."

00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:52,982
Hmm.

00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:55,485
So, hanging?

00:08:55,552 --> 00:08:56,653
At least.

00:08:56,719 --> 00:09:00,657
COD was asphyxiation
due to strangulation.

00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:03,259
Give me a hand here.

00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:05,962
Bruise behind the ear

00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:08,431
is characteristic
of a hanging.

00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:10,400
This bruise is not.

00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,635
What is that,
blunt force?

00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:15,371
Take a look at this.

00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:19,175
Separation of the first
and second vertebrae

00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:21,344
<i>prior</i> to death.

00:09:21,411 --> 00:09:23,012
He was paralyzed?

00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:26,149
That's something that would
only happen to a dwarf

00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:28,351
with pseudoachondroplasia.

00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:30,353
Physiology can make for

00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,322
cervical spine instability.

00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:34,090
So it's possible that
whoever did this

00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,825
knew something
about dwarf anatomy.

00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:00,750
Suspect on location!

00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:04,654
He was drinking.

00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,658
It was beer.

00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:12,862
I'll go process the back.

00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:49,265
Denim fiber from the cabinet.

00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:51,701
Could be nothing.

00:10:51,768 --> 00:10:57,507
And lots of smudges
but no prints worthwhile.

00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,275
Yeah, I didn't get
any prints either

00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:00,944
but I did get
a partial shoe tread

00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:01,945
from the back gate.

00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:07,383
And I don't think
our dead guy lived here.

00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,220
Based on...?

00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:11,588
These pictures.

00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:14,924
Got Detective Wolf

00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:18,261
looking for the homeowner's name
from the real estate records.

00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:19,696
So, our home invasion robbery

00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,598
may be not a home
invasion after all.

00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,970
So, would you mind if we
tape-lifted your shirt?

00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:28,605
Comb your hair
for evidence?

00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:29,639
Evidence of what?

00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:31,975
Well, the first person
at a crime scene

00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,611
often turns out to be
a viable suspect.

00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:36,613
I'm the one that
found his body.

00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,915
I'm the one that called it in.

00:11:38,982 --> 00:11:41,584
If you're innocent
it'll rule you out.

00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:42,986
Go ahead.

00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,126
Does he ever talk?

00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:51,961
Yeah.

00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:53,496
At, uh, random intervals.

00:11:53,563 --> 00:11:56,065
I was admiring
your reaching tool.

00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,935
I have one I use
to wipe my tush with.

00:11:59,002 --> 00:12:00,103
Would you like

00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:01,971
to take a look
at that, too?

00:12:02,038 --> 00:12:04,774
Hey, if the world
doesn't adapt itself to you

00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:07,277
you have to adapt yourself
to it, right?

00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:09,779
Yeah.

00:12:09,846 --> 00:12:12,582
You know, you probably
think I'm cold.

00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:13,583
Pulling slots

00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,786
after I found Lawrence
up there.

00:12:16,853 --> 00:12:18,054
This is the convention.

00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:19,822
Everything moves at warp speed.

00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:23,126
I'm done.
Thank you.

00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:32,502
You know, 51 weeks
in your hometown

00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:34,370
with nothing
but average-sized people.

00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:36,372
I have to fit a lifetime
into this week.

00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:39,175
We all do.

00:12:39,242 --> 00:12:40,977
Business connections,
gambling, romance.

00:12:41,044 --> 00:12:42,111
Excuse me.

00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,181
Did Lawrence have any
problems in those areas?

00:12:45,248 --> 00:12:46,649
Romance? Not at all.

00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:48,251
Lawrence was a pseudo.

00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:51,387
He could have his pick
of any girl in here.

00:12:53,489 --> 00:12:55,491
What's a pseudo?

00:12:55,558 --> 00:12:57,660
Dwarfs with
pseudoachondroplasia

00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,661
have features

00:12:58,728 --> 00:13:00,897
and head size
like normal people.

00:13:00,964 --> 00:13:04,133
Dwarfs with achondroplasia
have shortened limbs

00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,501
and enlarged heads.

00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:08,871
Different types of dwarfs,
different social status?

00:13:08,938 --> 00:13:12,609
Hey... discrimination
isn't just for tall people.

00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,291
Excuse me.

00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,729
Isn't this, uh,
Lawrence Ames's room?

00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:34,697
Yes.

00:13:34,764 --> 00:13:36,933
Who are you?

00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,338
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,874
I'm his fiancee.

00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,146
We always got those looks.

00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:53,182
I'm five-seven,
in case you were wondering.

00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,519
Our concern isn't your height;
it's your proximity.

00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,422
You're standing
in a potential crime scene.

00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:03,526
Would you please
sit down here?

00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,595
We want to keep
the contamination

00:14:05,662 --> 00:14:07,463
to a minimum.

00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,132
This is CSI Sidle.

00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,869
We need a uniform
in room 312 right away.

00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,704
Thanks.

00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,106
Didn't the police

00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:19,208
tell you not to come in here?

00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,810
Yes.

00:14:20,877 --> 00:14:23,479
But I wanted to be near
Lawrence's things.

00:14:23,546 --> 00:14:27,984
And, um... these are
Lawrence's things?

00:14:28,051 --> 00:14:29,953
Yes.

00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:43,078
Sara?

00:14:43,869 --> 00:14:46,105
Yeah?

00:14:53,178 --> 00:14:56,548
Gouge is deeper at the bottom
than the top.

00:14:56,615 --> 00:14:59,384
So the strike was made
coming down.

00:15:17,302 --> 00:15:19,271
Grissom.

00:15:24,643 --> 00:15:28,180
Did you and Mr. Ames have
an argument, say last night?

00:15:28,247 --> 00:15:29,782
No.

00:15:32,985 --> 00:15:35,053
You don't believe me?

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,158
Well, right now,
we believe the evidence.

00:15:42,578 --> 00:15:46,082
What are the marks
on his forearms?

00:15:46,148 --> 00:15:47,349
Hmm, can't say.

00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,385
But I do know

00:15:49,452 --> 00:15:52,354
that Teddy Henders died
from blunt force trauma.

00:15:52,421 --> 00:15:53,889
From what, do you think?

00:15:53,956 --> 00:15:55,424
A hammer, butt of a gun?

00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:57,993
I was just going to see
if I could figure that out.

00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,395
( <i>electric razor buzzing</i> )

00:16:09,105 --> 00:16:11,207
( <i>turns off razor</i> )

00:16:15,945 --> 00:16:18,147
"Z"?

00:16:19,248 --> 00:16:23,252
<i>There was a Z-Mover video game</i>
<i>on the floor</i>

00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:25,121
<i>next to the vic.</i>

00:16:26,655 --> 00:16:28,702
Murder by Z-Mover.

00:16:28,702 --> 00:16:30,661
The neighbors heard shouting.

00:16:30,661 --> 00:16:33,195
Two guys break
and enter

00:16:33,262 --> 00:16:35,798
and get into some kind
of an alternation.

00:16:41,404 --> 00:16:43,706
One ends up killing the other.

00:16:43,773 --> 00:16:45,274
And almost Catherine.

00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:49,445
That had to be scary, huh?

00:16:49,512 --> 00:16:52,314
I didn't have time
to be scared, David.

00:16:52,381 --> 00:16:54,049
Oh.

00:17:09,453 --> 00:17:12,078
Is the lipstick on this
champagne glass yours?

00:17:12,702 --> 00:17:14,702
No champagne for me.

00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:16,604
I'm pregnant.

00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,139
Only seven weeks.

00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:21,409
Is this your computer,
or Lawrence's?

00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:23,244
Lawrence's.

00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,580
We're going to have
to take it with us.

00:17:32,328 --> 00:17:33,821
BROWN:
Cath?

00:17:33,888 --> 00:17:35,119
You all right?

00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:40,561
Don't let him get to you
like that.

00:17:40,628 --> 00:17:42,997
I <i>was</i> scared...

00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,833
and I still am.

00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,636
Don't tell anybody.

00:17:51,495 --> 00:17:52,453
Hey, Greg.

00:17:52,453 --> 00:17:53,119
Hey.

00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:55,866
Get anything
off the rope?

00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:57,401
Yeah, a few brown hairs

00:17:57,467 --> 00:17:58,535
around the knot.

00:17:58,602 --> 00:18:00,404
Only one with a skin tag,
though.

00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,040
And those fibers that Sara found
on the body?

00:18:03,106 --> 00:18:03,786
Yeah?

00:18:03,786 --> 00:18:04,787
Polyester upholstery.

00:18:05,744 --> 00:18:07,679
Cheap rugs and
tacky furniture.

00:18:07,746 --> 00:18:08,981
I need these hairs.

00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,682
Uh, uh, no DNA tags on those.

00:18:10,749 --> 00:18:12,150
Doesn't matter.

00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,151
( <i>scoffs</i> )

00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,087
You know, I hate it
when he does that.

00:18:15,153 --> 00:18:17,255
I like to make a presentation,
you know?

00:18:17,322 --> 00:18:18,857
So, present.

00:18:18,924 --> 00:18:19,992
Eh, forget it.

00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,560
Scope's interesting.

00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:28,200
All right,
fresh epithelials.

00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:31,069
Yeah, I found them on the rope
near the anchor point.

00:18:31,136 --> 00:18:32,838
A minuscule sample, but useable.

00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,940
How long for DNA?

00:18:35,007 --> 00:18:36,842
Well, give me something
to compare it to.

00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:38,176
Get me the fiancee's blood.

00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:40,379
Well, I can't just give you
her blood.

00:18:40,445 --> 00:18:41,913
That takes a court order.

00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,049
I'm open 24 hours.

00:18:48,453 --> 00:18:51,023
"Met you in a pseudo chat room.

00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:52,791
Do you remember me?"

00:18:52,858 --> 00:18:55,961
"I remember you."

00:18:56,028 --> 00:18:58,430
( <i>muttering</i> )

00:18:58,497 --> 00:19:00,332
"...to the convention
this year?

00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:01,667
"I'd love to meet you.

00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:03,402
"See if you can pick me out.

00:19:03,468 --> 00:19:06,605
"Perfect face

00:19:06,672 --> 00:19:09,107
"perfect body.

00:19:09,174 --> 00:19:11,343
Count of three, handsome."

00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,121
SIDLE:
Jessica, you knew Lawrence

00:19:21,188 --> 00:19:23,390
was having an on-line affair
with another woman

00:19:23,457 --> 00:19:24,625
didn't you?

00:19:24,692 --> 00:19:25,960
BRASS:
You logged on at times

00:19:26,026 --> 00:19:27,194
when Lawrence
was at work.

00:19:27,261 --> 00:19:28,963
We checked his work records.

00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:31,031
A lot of girls liked Lawrence.

00:19:31,098 --> 00:19:33,234
He was funny and smart
and sweet.

00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,768
Danielle
was different.

00:19:34,835 --> 00:19:37,404
She was his size.

00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:40,374
She was... perfect.

00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:42,910
We found your skin
cells on the rope
that hung Lawrence.

00:19:42,977 --> 00:19:45,079
You're making that up.

00:19:45,145 --> 00:19:46,313
No, I'm not.

00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,548
BRASS:
Our court order

00:19:47,615 --> 00:19:48,749
your blood.

00:19:48,816 --> 00:19:51,151
I did not put a noose
around my fiancÃ©'s neck.

00:19:51,218 --> 00:19:53,120
Then explain how
your skin cells
got on the rope.

00:19:53,187 --> 00:19:55,623
I can't.

00:20:13,407 --> 00:20:16,010
Hey.

00:20:16,076 --> 00:20:18,646
Confronted the fiancee;
she stonewalled us.

00:20:18,712 --> 00:20:20,614
Brass told her
not to leave town.

00:20:20,681 --> 00:20:23,584
He sounded a bit
like Jack Lord,
don't you think?

00:20:23,651 --> 00:20:24,911
Well, she can go
wherever she wants to.

00:20:24,911 --> 00:20:25,879
She didn't do it.

00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:27,803
Take a look.

00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,706
Hair from the knot.

00:20:37,012 --> 00:20:38,947
They look thin.

00:20:39,014 --> 00:20:41,083
Diameter's 60% less than normal.

00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,151
Tensile strength

00:20:42,217 --> 00:20:44,219
is also
way below normal.

00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:45,788
You have a cross section?

00:20:45,854 --> 00:20:47,423
Mm-hmm.

00:20:50,325 --> 00:20:52,995
Hmm. No pigment
at the central core.

00:20:53,062 --> 00:20:55,464
No color.

00:20:55,531 --> 00:20:58,767
Cartilage hair hypoplasia.

00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:00,002
C.H.H.

00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:02,571
It's characterized
by fine, brittle body hair.

00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:04,506
It's an extremely rare syndrome.

00:21:04,573 --> 00:21:05,974
It's a form of dwarfism.

00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,509
Okay.

00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:08,911
So, back to the midgets.

00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:12,514
Nick... dwarfs or little people.

00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:14,083
You'll need to know
what to look for.

00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:16,919
So, I'll put together a list
of C.H.H. attributes.

00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,821
Well, you better do it fast.

00:21:18,887 --> 00:21:21,090
The convention's over
in two days.

00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:23,592
After that,
the <i>little people</i> go home

00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:25,661
and we lose all our suspects.

00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:42,613
Ms. Grace?

00:21:43,747 --> 00:21:45,415
Excuse me.

00:21:45,482 --> 00:21:47,217
I need your help.

00:21:47,284 --> 00:21:49,453
What now? My DNA?

00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:51,922
No, actually... your eyes.

00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:57,527
GRACE:
I'm sorry, I don't recognize her

00:21:57,594 --> 00:22:00,497
and a girl this pretty
I would remember.

00:22:00,564 --> 00:22:02,065
The guys would
still be drooling.

00:22:02,132 --> 00:22:04,368
Well, according
to the police

00:22:04,434 --> 00:22:06,470
there's no one named
Danielle registered

00:22:06,536 --> 00:22:08,271
at the hotel
or at the convention.

00:22:08,338 --> 00:22:11,475
You expected an Internet
handle to be a real name?

00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:14,077
Maybe the girl
got cold feet.

00:22:14,144 --> 00:22:16,413
My first IOLP convention--

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,384
I walk in, see 200 dwarfs
staring back at me

00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,852
and what goes
through my head?

00:22:21,918 --> 00:22:24,554
"There's no way
I look like these people."

00:22:24,621 --> 00:22:26,123
I ran.

00:22:26,189 --> 00:22:27,391
But you went back.

00:22:27,457 --> 00:22:28,392
Eventually.

00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,027
I guess I realized

00:22:30,093 --> 00:22:33,664
it's nice to see
eye-to-eye with someone.

00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,500
Mm.

00:22:36,566 --> 00:22:39,469
I get the impression that's
a little tough for you.

00:22:41,371 --> 00:22:45,609
"The freaks have looked
at her in a secret way

00:22:45,676 --> 00:22:48,078
"and tried to connect
their eyes with hers

00:22:48,145 --> 00:22:51,181
"as though to say,
'We know who you are.

00:22:51,248 --> 00:22:54,151
We are you.'"

00:22:54,217 --> 00:22:55,619
Faulkner.

00:22:55,686 --> 00:22:56,687
Close.

00:22:56,753 --> 00:22:59,489
Another southern writer.
Carson McCullers.

00:22:59,556 --> 00:23:03,193
I think we look for
the differences in each other

00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,962
to prove that we're not alone.

00:23:06,897 --> 00:23:08,098
What's yours?

00:23:08,165 --> 00:23:09,166
Your difference?

00:23:11,268 --> 00:23:13,003
Mine's the worst.

00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,871
Random gene.

00:23:14,938 --> 00:23:16,773
Anyone can have a dwarf.

00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:22,512
Sometimes I've even seen terror
in average-size people's eyes.

00:23:22,579 --> 00:23:25,315
I remind them that
their little carbon copies

00:23:25,382 --> 00:23:28,552
might not be
such a copy after all.

00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,557
Well, mine's genetic

00:23:33,624 --> 00:23:35,592
progressive

00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:39,363
and impossible to predict.

00:23:39,429 --> 00:23:41,431
And hard to notice...

00:23:41,498 --> 00:23:43,533
unless you tell someone.

00:23:47,437 --> 00:23:48,472
Got your beep.

00:23:48,538 --> 00:23:49,539
What'd you get?

00:23:49,606 --> 00:23:51,375
Denim fibers at 400x.

00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,778
The skin
from the dead guy

00:23:54,845 --> 00:23:57,214
and the denim found in
the cabinet were both coated

00:23:57,281 --> 00:23:59,316
in the same substance.

00:23:59,383 --> 00:24:01,918
You get a breakdown?

00:24:01,985 --> 00:24:04,154
Yeah, partially hydrogenated
soy bean oil

00:24:04,221 --> 00:24:06,623
traces of beef fat, sugar
and potato starch.

00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:09,293
Cooking grease.

00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:11,528
That would explain the marks
on the guy's forearms.

00:24:11,595 --> 00:24:12,896
Grease burns.

00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:17,734
So there's a good chance

00:24:17,801 --> 00:24:19,803
the victim worked
in a fast food joint.

00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,271
WOLF:
I got a feeling
they both did.

00:24:21,338 --> 00:24:23,106
The owner of the house

00:24:23,173 --> 00:24:25,108
has a franchise
of fast food places.

00:24:25,175 --> 00:24:27,210
Uh, Fast
and Fresh Burgers.

00:24:27,277 --> 00:24:29,246
I just got off the phone
with him from Hawaii.

00:24:29,313 --> 00:24:31,048
Alvin Jackson.

00:24:31,114 --> 00:24:32,849
Three stores in the Vegas area.

00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:34,284
And he's on his

00:24:34,351 --> 00:24:35,352
yearly
vacation.

00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:37,788
Something his employees
would definitely know.

00:24:39,122 --> 00:24:40,424
Get any addresses?

00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,792
You bet.

00:24:41,858 --> 00:24:43,627
Let's go check it out.

00:24:45,862 --> 00:24:47,798
SIDLE:
We're looking for
anything in the picture

00:24:47,864 --> 00:24:49,366
that might
give us a way to find her.

00:24:49,433 --> 00:24:51,635
Something in the background
that determines location

00:24:51,702 --> 00:24:53,503
a useful reflection, anything.

00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,739
Huh...

00:24:55,806 --> 00:24:56,840
Oh, I get it.

00:24:56,907 --> 00:24:58,241
This is like
a test, right?

00:24:58,308 --> 00:24:59,376
What do you mean?

00:24:59,443 --> 00:25:00,410
Individual
hair shadows

00:25:00,477 --> 00:25:04,247
are amorphous when they
should be distinct.

00:25:04,314 --> 00:25:06,016
In these two areas--

00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:09,152
here and here-- they're
on the same focal plane

00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:10,420
but this one's sharp

00:25:10,487 --> 00:25:12,990
and this one's fuzzy.

00:25:13,056 --> 00:25:14,791
This picture's a fake?

00:25:14,858 --> 00:25:15,993
A composite.

00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:17,995
A very good one.

00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,165
This explains
why nobody ever saw her.

00:25:22,232 --> 00:25:23,867
She only exists in pixels.

00:25:26,403 --> 00:25:27,871
Nat King Cole.

00:25:27,938 --> 00:25:29,239
Excuse me?

00:25:29,306 --> 00:25:32,676
Archie would you separate
the composite elements, please?

00:25:32,743 --> 00:25:33,744
Yup.

00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,785
The image
was built out of these.

00:25:41,852 --> 00:25:44,488
GRISSOM:
Now if you could,
pull up a photo

00:25:44,554 --> 00:25:46,256
of the victim,
grey scale.

00:25:51,695 --> 00:25:53,163
There's a theory in art

00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:56,166
that the Mona Lisa was really
a feminized version

00:25:56,233 --> 00:25:58,735
of Leonardo da Vinci
himself.

00:25:58,802 --> 00:26:01,371
Concept suggests...
deep down we're all narcissists?

00:26:01,438 --> 00:26:02,506
Yeah.

00:26:02,572 --> 00:26:05,342
What attracts us the most
is ourselves.

00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,446
Scale to match the original
picture with Danielle.

00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:30,767
SIDLE:
Danielle is
a virtual woman

00:26:30,834 --> 00:26:34,071
created to attract and lure
Lawrence Ames...

00:26:34,137 --> 00:26:35,839
away from his
fiancee, maybe?

00:26:35,906 --> 00:26:37,941
BRASS:
Boy, do I have

00:26:38,008 --> 00:26:38,976
good timing, or what?

00:26:39,042 --> 00:26:41,278
I did a little checking
with the phone company.

00:26:41,345 --> 00:26:43,780
In the past year,
Lawrence Ames received

00:26:43,847 --> 00:26:46,550
over 200 calls
from Melanie Grace.

00:26:46,617 --> 00:26:47,951
The same woman
that found him dead.

00:26:48,018 --> 00:26:51,188
He got call-blocking
against her two months ago.

00:26:51,254 --> 00:26:52,189
Well, that's interesting.

00:26:52,255 --> 00:26:53,557
That's the same time
Danielle started

00:26:53,624 --> 00:26:55,459
sending him
instant messages.

00:26:57,027 --> 00:26:58,629
Yes, I called Lawrence.

00:26:58,695 --> 00:26:59,997
We met in a chat room.

00:27:00,063 --> 00:27:01,264
He also called me.

00:27:01,331 --> 00:27:02,766
Did you look at
<i>my</i> phone records?

00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:04,768
He eventually
blocked your calls.

00:27:04,835 --> 00:27:07,771
The same week he got engaged
to Jessica Marcus.

00:27:07,838 --> 00:27:10,140
It was at that time
he began receiving

00:27:10,207 --> 00:27:14,778
messages from...
a perfect woman...

00:27:18,048 --> 00:27:19,316
...who doesn't really exist.

00:27:21,051 --> 00:27:22,719
You think that I would do that?

00:27:22,786 --> 00:27:24,321
Present myself
to a man

00:27:24,388 --> 00:27:27,157
as anything other than who I am?

00:27:27,224 --> 00:27:29,326
If it would break up
his new engagement.

00:27:31,094 --> 00:27:32,162
So what happened?

00:27:32,229 --> 00:27:34,598
You went to the convention

00:27:34,665 --> 00:27:38,835
you saw him with his tall
girlfriend and you go to Plan B?

00:27:43,307 --> 00:27:45,509
You think I'm capable of that?

00:27:45,575 --> 00:27:50,180
Killing because a woman
has some height on me?

00:27:50,247 --> 00:27:53,583
Pretending to be
an ideal...

00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:57,287
If you think that...

00:27:57,354 --> 00:27:59,489
then I was wrong about you.

00:28:17,407 --> 00:28:18,342
Hey.

00:28:18,408 --> 00:28:19,676
Do you mind, little man?

00:28:19,743 --> 00:28:20,777
I'm trying to work here.

00:28:20,844 --> 00:28:21,979
Really?
Yeah.

00:28:22,045 --> 00:28:24,514
You making any progress,
CSI man?

00:28:26,116 --> 00:28:27,250
Some.
Uh-huh.

00:28:27,317 --> 00:28:29,786
Are we getting your
A-game or your B-game?

00:28:29,853 --> 00:28:30,921
Come again?

00:28:30,988 --> 00:28:31,989
You see

00:28:32,055 --> 00:28:33,357
us little people

00:28:33,423 --> 00:28:35,692
we're used to getting
the short end of the stick.

00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:36,827
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:28:36,893 --> 00:28:38,395
You don't get to laugh at that.

00:28:47,471 --> 00:28:49,539
What I want
to know is

00:28:49,606 --> 00:28:52,976
are you treating this like
a case or like a joke?

00:28:53,043 --> 00:28:55,712
Well, a man was killed;
that's no joke.

00:28:58,982 --> 00:29:01,018
You got my A-game.

00:29:01,084 --> 00:29:02,986
Yeah?

00:29:03,053 --> 00:29:05,622
Yeah.

00:29:05,689 --> 00:29:07,791
Carry on.

00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,181
Uh, Grissom.

00:29:31,248 --> 00:29:33,216
There's, uh, something
weird going on

00:29:33,283 --> 00:29:34,885
with the hairs
from the ropes.

00:29:34,952 --> 00:29:36,720
Well, not weird.

00:29:36,787 --> 00:29:39,089
More like... hair-raising.

00:29:40,324 --> 00:29:41,959
Sorry, bad one.

00:29:42,025 --> 00:29:43,260
Um, okay,
at first I thought

00:29:43,327 --> 00:29:45,162
that maybe I was
doing something wrong--

00:29:45,228 --> 00:29:46,997
running too many
DNA samples, you know

00:29:47,064 --> 00:29:48,031
seeing things.

00:29:48,098 --> 00:29:50,033
Greg?

00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,702
( <i>exhales</i> )

00:29:51,768 --> 00:29:54,404
Uh, the dwarf hair
has seven alleles in common

00:29:54,471 --> 00:29:56,406
with Jessica Marcus's
skin cells.

00:29:58,308 --> 00:29:59,843
The two donors are related.

00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,712
Profiles say so.

00:30:01,778 --> 00:30:03,914
( <i>cell phone ringing</i> )

00:30:06,116 --> 00:30:07,351
Grissom.

00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:09,486
STOKES:
He looked like he fit
your profile.

00:30:09,553 --> 00:30:10,520
So, I asked around.

00:30:10,587 --> 00:30:13,724
Two little people
confirmed he has C.H.H.

00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,058
Okay, thank you.

00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:16,126
Yeah.

00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,067
Kevin Marcus?

00:30:25,168 --> 00:30:26,970
Buying or browsing?

00:30:27,037 --> 00:30:28,105
Maybe a little bit
of both.

00:30:28,171 --> 00:30:31,074
Rope for makeshift
banisters, huh?

00:30:31,141 --> 00:30:32,976
That rag rope... cuts the hands.

00:30:33,043 --> 00:30:34,711
Now you feel this nylon.

00:30:34,778 --> 00:30:35,979
Go ahead

00:30:36,046 --> 00:30:37,648
feel that.

00:30:37,714 --> 00:30:40,317
I do trade shows

00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,152
mail order...

00:30:42,219 --> 00:30:44,421
I even sold to this convention.

00:30:44,488 --> 00:30:46,657
So what do you,
buy from wholesalers

00:30:46,723 --> 00:30:48,659
and then repackage
in your home?

00:30:48,725 --> 00:30:50,260
Yeah, Chicago.

00:30:50,327 --> 00:30:51,495
Well, that explains

00:30:51,495 --> 00:30:53,495
how your daughter's skin cells
got all over the rope

00:30:53,495 --> 00:30:55,265
that hung
Lawrence Ames.

00:30:55,332 --> 00:30:56,266
Your daughter's name

00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:57,834
is Jessica, right?

00:30:57,901 --> 00:30:59,569
The lab
also found

00:30:59,636 --> 00:31:01,438
your hair all over that rope.

00:31:01,505 --> 00:31:03,240
Well, I touch
all the merchandise.

00:31:03,307 --> 00:31:04,808
Nice try, Kev.

00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:07,210
They hair
was caught in the noose.

00:31:10,981 --> 00:31:13,550
Did you know
your father killed Lawrence?

00:31:13,617 --> 00:31:15,686
That's what they told me

00:31:15,752 --> 00:31:18,021
but I couldn't believe it.

00:31:18,088 --> 00:31:21,358
I still can't.

00:31:21,425 --> 00:31:22,759
So you created
Danielle

00:31:22,826 --> 00:31:25,195
to break up your
daughter's engagement.

00:31:25,262 --> 00:31:27,197
That's an interesting theory.

00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,168
What?

00:31:31,234 --> 00:31:33,804
You guys trace an online
account to my credit card

00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,605
or something like that?

00:31:35,672 --> 00:31:37,174
Oh, no, wait.

00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,810
Um, I use a free ISP.

00:31:39,876 --> 00:31:45,849
That means no name,
no trail, no case.

00:31:47,584 --> 00:31:49,486
Mr. Marcus, in your business

00:31:49,553 --> 00:31:51,888
you deal with proportions,
correct?

00:31:51,955 --> 00:31:54,625
You provide little people
with what they need

00:31:54,691 --> 00:31:56,627
to compensate
for their proportions

00:31:56,693 --> 00:31:57,961
and to live with them.

00:31:58,028 --> 00:32:03,000
You know what little people
aspire to be.

00:32:03,066 --> 00:32:07,504
Your, uh,
logo is interesting.

00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:10,407
Da Vinci's "Vitruvian Man."

00:32:12,442 --> 00:32:16,380
In the perfect human form,
arm span equals height.

00:32:18,115 --> 00:32:19,383
You're very aware
of what, uh

00:32:19,449 --> 00:32:22,586
people are looking for
in a mate

00:32:22,653 --> 00:32:25,522
aren't you?

00:32:25,589 --> 00:32:29,459
The night before he died,
Lawrence and I had a fight

00:32:29,526 --> 00:32:31,895
about Danielle.

00:32:31,962 --> 00:32:33,797
Are still
in contact with her?

00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:35,098
She e-mails
or IM's.

00:32:35,165 --> 00:32:37,100
I don't answer. I love you.

00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:39,436
You're lying.
You're cheating on me!

00:32:42,205 --> 00:32:43,941
And I ran
out of the house

00:32:44,007 --> 00:32:48,111
and I went to my dad.

00:32:48,178 --> 00:32:54,518
I was crying and he told me
to leave Lawrence

00:32:54,584 --> 00:33:00,457
but I couldn't because...
I... I loved him.

00:33:00,524 --> 00:33:03,760
I'm having
our baby.

00:33:03,827 --> 00:33:07,531
And I went back to our room
and we made up.

00:33:10,334 --> 00:33:14,638
And the next night...

00:33:14,705 --> 00:33:18,008
he said he was going out
to meet a friend.

00:33:25,515 --> 00:33:26,817
I'll be back
in an hour.

00:33:29,186 --> 00:33:31,421
And he never came back.

00:33:33,223 --> 00:33:35,158
So, what'd you have
against the guy?

00:33:35,225 --> 00:33:36,660
What are you, blind?

00:33:36,727 --> 00:33:39,062
He was a dwarf.

00:33:39,129 --> 00:33:40,731
My wife and I

00:33:40,797 --> 00:33:44,134
our daughter--
a genetic miracle.

00:33:44,201 --> 00:33:46,269
One-in-four shot

00:33:46,336 --> 00:33:47,371
she'd be an average.

00:33:47,437 --> 00:33:49,072
And she was
a beautiful average.

00:33:49,139 --> 00:33:51,675
So your wife is also a dwarf.

00:33:51,742 --> 00:33:53,477
Yeah.

00:33:53,543 --> 00:33:55,345
Jessica didn't have
to fight the world

00:33:55,412 --> 00:33:57,614
every day, like we did.

00:33:57,681 --> 00:33:59,483
We freed her from all that.

00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:01,918
But that
little bastard

00:34:01,985 --> 00:34:04,154
kept dragging her
right back down into it.

00:34:04,221 --> 00:34:05,422
So you killed him.

00:34:05,489 --> 00:34:07,090
I said I didn't like the guy.

00:34:07,157 --> 00:34:09,393
I didn't kill anybody.

00:34:13,063 --> 00:34:15,432
( <i>exhales deeply</i> )

00:34:15,499 --> 00:34:17,100
Can we prove it?

00:34:17,167 --> 00:34:18,335
Not yet.

00:34:18,402 --> 00:34:20,037
The rope was anchored
to the lighting truss

00:34:20,103 --> 00:34:21,171
which was at least five feet

00:34:21,238 --> 00:34:22,306
over his head.

00:34:22,372 --> 00:34:23,874
So?

00:34:23,941 --> 00:34:25,742
He can barely lift his arms
above his shoulders.

00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:29,046
He suffers from
lumbar lordosis

00:34:29,112 --> 00:34:30,380
swayback...

00:34:30,447 --> 00:34:33,250
which is typical of C.H.H.

00:34:33,317 --> 00:34:35,919
and it limits his mobility
even more.

00:34:35,986 --> 00:34:38,021
Hey, the guy put a rope
around the victim's neck.

00:34:38,088 --> 00:34:41,658
Yeah, but how did he hang him?

00:34:49,453 --> 00:34:50,821
Listen, Catherine

00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:53,891
me and Warrick
can handle this.

00:34:55,292 --> 00:34:56,226
I'm going in.

00:34:56,293 --> 00:34:57,428
Well, the guy
assaulted you.

00:34:57,494 --> 00:35:00,831
You don't have to put yourself
through this, you know.

00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:01,952
I don't, I'll be scared
of the next guy

00:35:01,952 --> 00:35:02,827
and the one after that.

00:35:08,772 --> 00:35:11,809
Shoe tread, denim fiber,
a lot of cooking grease.

00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:14,344
Based on that evidence,
they <i>all</i> did it.

00:35:14,411 --> 00:35:18,716
All right, so we
take them one by one.

00:35:18,782 --> 00:35:20,851
Transfer works both ways.

00:35:24,354 --> 00:35:25,456
( <i>unzipping</i> )

00:35:25,522 --> 00:35:26,924
Warrick?

00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:31,962
Blow your nose.

00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:33,831
I don't gotta.

00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:43,774
( <i>blowing</i> )

00:35:49,012 --> 00:35:50,781
Guess.

00:35:52,082 --> 00:35:53,250
( <i>blowing</i> )

00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:04,928
I don't think so.

00:36:04,995 --> 00:36:09,133
Then I guess I'll just
have to look for myself.

00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:11,535
You want to look
at my boogers,
lady, go ahead.

00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:12,903
Hey!

00:36:24,214 --> 00:36:28,552
Nose hairs...
are nature's filter.

00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:31,889
Traps all
kinds of things.

00:36:31,955 --> 00:36:35,025
Dust, dirt...

00:36:36,293 --> 00:36:38,328
...fingerprint powder.

00:36:38,395 --> 00:36:40,631
( <i>exhales</i> )

00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,832
You did it.

00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:44,401
( <i>grunting</i> )

00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:48,305
You inhaled the fingerprint dust
I was using.

00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:51,675
We went up there
to party 'cause the
boss was out of town

00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,310
and I saw the
Z-Mover first

00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,112
but Teddy... Teddy...

00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:59,216
I saw it first.

00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:00,551
I saw it first.

00:37:00,617 --> 00:37:02,152
It's mine.

00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:03,420
I saw it first.
I called it.

00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:04,988
You want it,
you bastard?!

00:37:05,055 --> 00:37:06,523
I didn't mean
to kill him.

00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,825
It was
an accident.

00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:09,059
I mean, I...

00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:10,060
Get up.

00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:12,796
I didn't mean...

00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:20,704
You all right?

00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:23,340
Yeah.

00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,276
NICK:
Hey, did you get anything else
off that laptop?

00:37:26,343 --> 00:37:28,479
No, a bunch of the files
were corrupted.

00:37:28,545 --> 00:37:30,748
Archie's taking
another run at them.

00:37:30,814 --> 00:37:32,883
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:43,660
Victim was paralyzed,
couldn't fight back.

00:37:43,727 --> 00:37:47,264
Kevin Marcus puts the
rope around his neck

00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:48,866
makes a slip knot.

00:37:48,932 --> 00:37:50,501
And ties off
the other end
on the truss

00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:51,702
even though there
is no way

00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,270
he could
have reached it.

00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:55,239
No way he could've
reached it.

00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:13,457
Nick, what
are you doing?

00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:17,094
Changing my perspective.

00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,763
( <i>groans</i> ):
Oh, man.

00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,066
Can you imagine going
through life at
this height?

00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:24,735
They do okay.

00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,237
If the world doesn't adapt
itself to you, you...

00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:30,040
...Adapt yourself to it.

00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,985
Where's Grissom?

00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:44,588
( <i>patrons talking</i> )

00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:09,113
Grissom?

00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,517
We know how
he did it.

00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:15,152
BRASS:
Your wheelchair

00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:17,821
was in the booth
at the convention.

00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:20,657
The fibers from the seat cover
to your wheelchair

00:39:20,724 --> 00:39:23,427
match the fibers
we found on the victim.

00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:26,764
Uh, faux, fake sheepskin.

00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:30,300
We also know
how you got Mr. Ames

00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:33,370
into the theater.

00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:36,774
Our lab retrieved
a final instant message

00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:41,245
to Lawrence
from Danielle.

00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:49,386
Mr. Marcus, what
are you doing here?

00:39:51,588 --> 00:39:54,091
It's enough to convict you.

00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:57,161
GRISSOM:
May I ask
a question?

00:39:57,227 --> 00:40:00,097
How did you get him
into the wheelchair?

00:40:02,499 --> 00:40:06,236
Well... I appealed
to his vanity.

00:40:07,604 --> 00:40:08,839
I told him I needed

00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:12,876
a brochure model
to sell my new chair.

00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,378
You don't want me
near your daughter

00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:15,913
but you want me
to hawk your chairs?

00:40:15,979 --> 00:40:18,415
I never said
you weren't handsome.

00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:21,852
I mean, come on--
your face, your build--

00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,755
a million chairs, "Sold."

00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:26,490
Great, come on.

00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,926
Hop in.

00:40:28,992 --> 00:40:30,327
Hop in, let me see you in there.

00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:31,862
Come on.

00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,097
Model for me.

00:40:34,164 --> 00:40:36,233
There you go.

00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,203
Wait, let me make an adjustment
for you, here.

00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,439
<i>I paralyzed him.</i>

00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:59,957
I couldn't let Jessica
marry him.

00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,895
Any kid they have...

00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,798
a 50% chance
it would be a dwarf.

00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:10,868
You have
to understand that.

00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:17,007
( <i>sighs</i> )

00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:18,642
It's genetics.

00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:24,248
Mr. Marcus, I think
you should know...

00:41:24,314 --> 00:41:26,702
your daughter is
already pregnant

00:41:26,702 --> 00:41:29,304
by Lawrence Ames.

00:41:55,964 --> 00:41:57,733
You know
what's really sad?

00:41:57,799 --> 00:41:59,534
This wasn't just a murder.

00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:01,503
It was a hate crime.

00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:04,306
Kevin Marcus hated himself.

00:42:33,235 --> 00:42:35,671
Dr. Grissom,
welcome back.

00:42:49,578 --> 00:42:51,147
Take care of yourself.
