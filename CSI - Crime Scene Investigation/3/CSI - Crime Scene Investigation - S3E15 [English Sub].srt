00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:13,543
Turn around.

00:00:16,246 --> 00:00:17,581
Go ahead.

00:00:17,647 --> 00:00:18,815
Next.

00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,227
( <i>beeping</i> )

00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,363
My kitty's pierced.

00:00:34,598 --> 00:00:35,732
Want to see?

00:00:52,215 --> 00:00:54,317
DJ:
Angels, devils...

00:00:54,384 --> 00:00:56,319
virgins and sinners,

00:00:56,386 --> 00:01:00,824
let the foam take you away
to your deepest desires.

00:01:00,891 --> 00:01:03,760
Cleanse yourself.

00:01:03,827 --> 00:01:05,428
There's no turning back now.

00:01:32,956 --> 00:01:34,824
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:50,340
Ever been
to a foam party?

00:01:50,407 --> 00:01:51,608
What do you think?

00:01:51,675 --> 00:01:54,444
Things can get pretty wild.

00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:57,080
Evidently.

00:01:57,147 --> 00:01:58,381
You got an I.D.
on this guy?

00:01:58,448 --> 00:02:00,283
Yeah, the deceased
is Trey Buchman.

00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,385
Age 21.
I got a Vegas I.D.

00:02:02,452 --> 00:02:03,486
Eyewitnesses?

00:02:03,553 --> 00:02:06,223
Uh, too much foam.

00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:07,324
The party was over.

00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,125
Most of the responsible
young adults had split.

00:02:09,192 --> 00:02:11,628
It's amazing how the sight
of blood can clear a room.

00:02:11,695 --> 00:02:12,829
Yeah. I'll tell you
what we got.

00:02:12,896 --> 00:02:14,931
My guys are talking with
the girl who found the body,

00:02:14,998 --> 00:02:16,967
but even sober, she's
not going to be much help.

00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:18,502
Wonder what made this wound?

00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:20,337
Looks like a puncture.

00:02:20,403 --> 00:02:22,138
Ice pick, maybe?

00:02:23,607 --> 00:02:25,942
Well, wow, tell you
it's not for the money.

00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:27,110
I got about

00:02:27,177 --> 00:02:29,179
three grand here,
all in C-notes.

00:02:29,246 --> 00:02:31,047
Proves the old adage.

00:02:31,114 --> 00:02:32,382
Which adage is that?

00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:34,851

<i>Foam at the Sinner's Den.</i>

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,620
I hung out here
a few times.

00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:13,955
Never been.

00:03:14,022 --> 00:03:16,457
Your knucklehead boyfriend never
took you on the party circuit?

00:03:16,524 --> 00:03:17,458
Uh, pass.

00:03:17,525 --> 00:03:19,027
That's cool about Vegas.

00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:20,962

Rain at the Palms,

RAW at the Luxor,

00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,168
Thursday's Baby's...

00:03:27,235 --> 00:03:30,271
Hey, look.
Some kid dropped dead.

00:03:30,338 --> 00:03:31,706
It's a shame.

00:03:31,773 --> 00:03:33,341
Kids OD all the time
in nightclubs.

00:03:33,408 --> 00:03:34,809
They're big boys and girls.
This ain't church.

00:03:34,876 --> 00:03:36,377
I understand that.

00:03:36,444 --> 00:03:38,079
You understand.
You know the kind of rent I pay

00:03:38,146 --> 00:03:39,314
on a joint like this?
Rain or shine,

00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,348
I owe the landlord $50,000.

00:03:40,415 --> 00:03:41,783
You're breaking my heart, pal.

00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,151
Look, here's how this works.

00:03:43,218 --> 00:03:44,219
The more you cooperate

00:03:44,285 --> 00:03:45,753
the sooner you'll
be up and running.

00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,088
You don't get it.
No, I get it.

00:03:47,155 --> 00:03:49,157
I got a daughter who's 20,
she hangs out.

00:03:49,224 --> 00:03:51,392
I don't want her to die
in a place like this,

00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:52,393
so do me a favor,

00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,696
get me the VIP list
for tonight.

00:03:54,762 --> 00:03:56,131
And smarten up.

00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:10,011
There's seminal fluid

00:04:10,078 --> 00:04:11,279
all over the place.

00:04:11,346 --> 00:04:13,715
Is this a dance club
or a sex club?

00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:15,216
It's a little
of both.

00:04:15,283 --> 00:04:17,218
Don't you love
this town?

00:04:17,285 --> 00:04:19,154
Whatever you say, Superfly.

00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,325
( <i>sniffing</i> )

00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:28,463
You guys smell that?

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,964
Mm-hmm.

00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:31,065
Smells like strawberries.

00:04:31,132 --> 00:04:33,034
It's the foam.

00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:35,703
Reminds me of the Mirage.

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,908
Steve Wynn didn't like the smell
of the volcano erupting,

00:04:39,974 --> 00:04:41,576
so he changed the fuel mixture.

00:04:41,643 --> 00:04:43,611
Now it smells like
a piña colada.

00:04:46,881 --> 00:04:47,916
Hey.

00:04:47,982 --> 00:04:49,317
BRASS:
I got a line on our vic.

00:04:49,384 --> 00:04:52,220
Trey Buchman,
booked a room at the Sphere.

00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:54,189
E-Wing, room 937.

00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:08,269
These people are freaks.

00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,474
Got a long dark hair.

00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:16,945
Vic had short hair.

00:05:19,714 --> 00:05:22,584
One of our freaks
wears pussycat pink.

00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,018
WOMAN:
<i>The battle was fierce.</i>

00:05:24,085 --> 00:05:26,621
The evil sorceress had

00:05:26,688 --> 00:05:28,690
powerful magic,
but the prince

00:05:28,756 --> 00:05:30,492
was brave and true.

00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:35,797
Finally, the brave prince slew

00:05:35,864 --> 00:05:38,333
the sorceress-dragon

00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,667
and went to awaken

00:05:39,734 --> 00:05:41,636
his beloved princess.

00:05:41,703 --> 00:05:42,971
You're late, Eddie.

00:05:43,037 --> 00:05:44,305
Don't start.

00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:46,808
He climbed the many stairs
to the top...

WILLOWS:
You know how much

00:05:48,343 --> 00:05:49,511
this meant to Lindsey?

00:05:49,577 --> 00:05:51,146
Can we argue
about this later, okay?

00:05:53,882 --> 00:05:56,851
Her eyes would open
with true love's kiss.

00:05:56,918 --> 00:05:58,653
She's so beautiful.

00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,721
Give me that.

00:06:04,092 --> 00:06:06,161
Nice perfume.

00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:13,001
Fine.

00:06:14,903 --> 00:06:15,837
Is this okay?

00:06:15,904 --> 00:06:16,971
WOMAN:

My prince...

00:06:23,244 --> 00:06:24,746
at long last,
you've come for me.

00:06:24,813 --> 00:06:26,981
My...

00:06:27,048 --> 00:06:29,851
My, my prince...

00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:31,686
WOMAN:
At long last,

00:06:31,753 --> 00:06:34,355
you've come
for me.

00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:45,300
I'm sorry, baby.
You did good, though.

00:06:45,366 --> 00:06:48,436
Yeah, you were fine,
Linds. Great.

00:06:48,503 --> 00:06:50,271
Hey, and you know what?

00:06:50,338 --> 00:06:53,041
It's just a play.

00:06:53,107 --> 00:06:54,742
No, it's not just a play.

00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:56,177
I was Sleeping Beauty

00:06:56,244 --> 00:06:57,479
and you guys
ruined it.

00:06:57,545 --> 00:06:58,713
I'm sorry, honey.

00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,248
Hey, I'll bet
if you ask

00:07:00,315 --> 00:07:02,016
Mrs. Parker, she'd let you keep

00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,685
that blue dress.

00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:05,053
I want to go home.

00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:06,754
Okay.

00:07:06,821 --> 00:07:08,523
Let's go home.

00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,724
No, Mom.

00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,359
I want to go with Dad.

00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:14,229
You sure about that?

00:07:16,831 --> 00:07:17,866
Okay.

00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:21,369
Tox report
on your foam guy

00:07:21,436 --> 00:07:23,238
came back negative.

00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,373
Negative?

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,574
No drugs,
no alcohol,

00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:29,177
no medication,
not even an aspirin.

00:07:29,244 --> 00:07:30,445
That's odd.

00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:32,981
It was a den of iniquity.

00:07:33,047 --> 00:07:35,483
What about the neck wound?

00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,918
The sternocleidomastoid

00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:39,554
muscle and the jugular
vein were lacerated.

00:07:42,423 --> 00:07:44,926
The wound was a bloody mess,
probably lethal.

00:07:44,993 --> 00:07:46,361
Any idea what caused it?

00:07:46,427 --> 00:07:47,695
Hard to say.

00:07:47,762 --> 00:07:49,397
Definitely an odd
entry wound.

00:07:49,464 --> 00:07:51,299
Not a knife or sharp object.

00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:53,701
Probably something blunt,
like a pen

00:07:53,768 --> 00:07:54,736
or a stake
of some sort.

00:07:54,803 --> 00:07:55,737
Anything else?

00:07:55,804 --> 00:07:57,138
Check this out.

00:08:00,275 --> 00:08:01,409
Looks like a bite.

00:08:01,476 --> 00:08:02,443
Spider bite

00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,512
or allergic reaction, maybe?

00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:05,580
Stand by.

00:08:05,647 --> 00:08:07,415
I'll process the tissue
in histopath,

00:08:07,482 --> 00:08:09,083
see if it's worth
writing home about.

00:08:14,455 --> 00:08:15,590
BROWN:
I was wondering

00:08:15,657 --> 00:08:17,325
where I put my nice
silver satin thong.

00:08:17,392 --> 00:08:19,294
Gloves.

00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,766
Okay, we're looking for
any kind of blunt object

00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,901
that could've
been used

00:08:26,968 --> 00:08:29,304
to stab our victim in the neck.

00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:35,043
Glow stick.

00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:38,713
Ball-point pen.

00:08:40,181 --> 00:08:41,149
Cell phone antenna.

00:08:43,351 --> 00:08:44,953
You have the Luminol?

00:08:46,521 --> 00:08:48,289
Thank you.

00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,167
Nothing.

00:09:04,005 --> 00:09:05,974
Are we sure
it was a blunt object?

00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:16,551
Size ten, double A.

00:09:16,618 --> 00:09:18,686
Stilettos, huh?

00:09:18,753 --> 00:09:21,489
Brings out the toes,
accentuates the legs.

00:09:21,556 --> 00:09:23,358
Murder on the
ankles, though.

00:09:29,864 --> 00:09:32,066
Looks like murder to me.

Well, you got lucky.

00:09:41,323 --> 00:09:42,924
You're on my list now.

00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:44,359

Okay, this is the story.

One of you lovely Cinderellas

Almost.

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,132
No.

Well, if the shoe fits...

00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,279
Wear it.

So far.

00:10:46,488 --> 00:10:48,990
Thanks for asking.

00:10:49,057 --> 00:10:51,426
You want to tell me
how your shoe ended up

00:10:51,493 --> 00:10:52,894
in Trey Buchman's neck?

00:10:56,598 --> 00:10:58,266
I don't know.

00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:03,405
Last I remember,
the foam was rising...

00:11:03,472 --> 00:11:09,077
<i>and my heel went into</i>
<i>something... soft.</i>

00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,981
Thought it was someone's foot.

00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,049
Jugular.

00:11:14,116 --> 00:11:15,350
There's a slight difference.

00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:16,818
Do you want to tell me

00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,820
why you left
your shoe behind?

00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,322
Heel broke.

00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,524
And the fact it had blood on it,
that wasn't the reason?

00:11:22,591 --> 00:11:24,526
Never saw blood.

00:11:24,593 --> 00:11:25,560
I see.

00:11:25,627 --> 00:11:27,062
I did some checking--

00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:29,064
because that's what I do--

00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:32,667
and you and our victim
had a relationship a while back.

00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:37,873
I've "relationshipped" about
a dozen guys on the circuit,

00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:40,075
including Trey.

00:11:40,142 --> 00:11:43,078
Nothing ends-- we still all
meet up at the club.

00:11:43,145 --> 00:11:44,913
I see.

00:11:54,122 --> 00:11:57,926
And the way he
gave it to me,

00:11:57,993 --> 00:11:59,528
believe me,

00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:04,232
he's the last guy
I'd want dead.

Excuse me, Jim.

00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:10,338
Am I interrupting something?

00:12:10,405 --> 00:12:12,040
Gil, please.

00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,446
Miss...
( <i>donning rubber gloves</i> )

00:12:17,512 --> 00:12:19,848
I'm going to need
a sample of your DNA.

00:12:19,915 --> 00:12:21,750
How do you want it?

00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:23,351
I like your hair.

00:12:23,418 --> 00:12:25,987
I like yours.

00:12:26,054 --> 00:12:27,989
Are you a, uh, natural blonde?

00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,698
Ow.

00:12:36,765 --> 00:12:37,666
Sorry.

00:12:37,732 --> 00:12:40,035
I needed a
follicular tag.

( <i>envelope rustles</i> )

00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:42,337
Thank you.

00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:45,707
Gil?

00:12:46,942 --> 00:12:48,510
Any chance you found my thong?

00:12:48,577 --> 00:12:50,545
Silver lamÃ©,

00:12:50,612 --> 00:12:52,380
probably twisted in knots.

00:12:52,447 --> 00:12:53,849
Oh, yeah, we did.

00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:55,517
You'll need to fill
out a form, though.

00:12:55,584 --> 00:12:56,751
The captain will help you.

00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,120
Surely.

00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:40,295
( <i>opera playing</i>

00:13:47,469 --> 00:13:49,404

Right after the murder.

00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:01,316
Opera makes it all
seem so lovely.

00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:02,317
And at the risk

00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,052
of sounding
like your mother,

00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:06,021
you're to ruin
your eardrums.

00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:07,689
( <i>turns music off</i> )

00:14:07,756 --> 00:14:10,192
Our victim's tissue--
Trey Buchman.

00:14:10,258 --> 00:14:11,493
The, uh, circular
contusions

00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,395
I sectioned,
indicate damage

00:14:13,462 --> 00:14:16,531
extending only
30 microns below
the epidermis.

00:14:16,598 --> 00:14:19,367
So it's not a bug bite.

00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:21,670
Man-made, high-pressure,
subcutaneous injector.

00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:22,671
No needle?

00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,172
Simply high pressure

00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,640
penetrating the skin.

00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,547
Did you send a sample to tox?

00:14:32,614 --> 00:14:35,183
Our victim was injected
with insulin.

00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,018
Diabetic?

00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,320
Nope.

00:14:38,386 --> 00:14:40,989
So cause of death
was insulin shock.

00:14:41,056 --> 00:14:42,524
Insulin doesn't make

00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,926
for a narcotic
or hallucinogenic high

00:14:44,993 --> 00:14:46,228
so I don't know
why Buchman

00:14:46,294 --> 00:14:48,230
would take the stuff.

00:14:48,296 --> 00:14:50,599
STOKES:
<i>Downstairs neighbor smelled it.</i>

00:14:50,665 --> 00:14:52,067
Called the plumber.

00:14:52,134 --> 00:14:54,736
Yeah, they always think
it's a sewage problem.

00:14:54,803 --> 00:14:56,304
( <i>cell phone ringing</i> )
Phew!

00:14:57,305 --> 00:14:59,274

00:15:00,308 --> 00:15:02,010
Ed? Hello?

00:15:02,077 --> 00:15:03,979
Uh... bad connection, Ed.

00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:06,081
Uh, I just
entered a scene.

00:15:06,148 --> 00:15:07,849
I-I'll call
you later.

00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,351
Whew.

00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:10,919
No pain,

00:15:10,986 --> 00:15:12,387
no gain.

00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,656
Purge fluid.

00:15:14,723 --> 00:15:16,725
D.U.N.S.

Dead Upstairs Neighbor Syndrome.

00:15:21,062 --> 00:15:22,631
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, well,

00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:23,765
it's going to take us
a while

00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:25,767
to get this smell
out of our nose hairs.

00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:27,269
Parchment changes
of the skin.

00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:30,405
So what's the exposure
to that window, south?

00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:31,540
East.

00:15:31,606 --> 00:15:33,375
Gets direct sunlight
half the day.

00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:34,609
I learned that down
in Lauderdale.

00:15:34,676 --> 00:15:36,111
You know, you've got to remember
to turn.

00:15:36,178 --> 00:15:38,046
Right, all that
spring break activity

00:15:38,113 --> 00:15:39,347
with your frat brothers.

00:15:39,414 --> 00:15:41,450
Well, something like that.

00:15:41,516 --> 00:15:44,252
Nice little
cocaine fingernail.

00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:47,489
So... no mail built up.

00:15:47,556 --> 00:15:50,892
I don't see a telephone.

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,061
What do you think?

Eddie?

00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,333
Ed?

00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,836
Now what's his deal?

00:16:00,902 --> 00:16:02,037
Lindsey's with him.

00:16:02,103 --> 00:16:04,005
Maybe she's ready
to come home.

00:16:04,072 --> 00:16:05,574
Yeah, I bet.

00:16:35,904 --> 00:16:38,006
How you doing?

00:16:44,513 --> 00:16:45,580
Designer threads.

Ten-to-one, Croix Richards
is a drug dealer.

00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,519
And that is no
workout accident.

Eddie, you've got to get
to a land line.

00:17:26,688 --> 00:17:29,024
We were in the car, going fast.

00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,692
We hit something.

00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,661
It's going to be okay, honey.

00:17:32,727 --> 00:17:33,695
I'm on my way.

00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:35,197
I just need to know
where you are.

00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,198
I don't know.

00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:37,299
There's lots of water.

00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:38,467
Are you near a lake?

00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:40,202
Are you near Grandma's house?

00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:43,972
No, the water's in the car.

00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,540
In the car?

Lindsey, can you get out?

00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,845
No.

It's going to be okay, honey.

00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:54,049
Just listen to me.

Before the car crashed,
where were you going?

00:17:57,686 --> 00:17:59,654
Daddy said the hospital.

00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:01,189
On the way there,
did you see any hotels?

00:18:01,256 --> 00:18:03,391
I saw the castle.

00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,726
Excalibur.

the pyramid?

00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:13,335
There was a bridge.

had pink hair.

Why wasn't he driving it?

Never, never,

He loves Lindsey.
He'd never do that.

Not willingly.

00:21:04,043 --> 00:21:06,779
I'm going to
go look for
him, though.

00:21:06,846 --> 00:21:08,915
I'm just going to
be right over there.

00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:12,418
Okay, that's enough.

00:21:12,485 --> 00:21:14,854
I want you to stay here
with Detective Vega.

00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:17,356
Okay?

00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:21,327
How you doing?

00:21:21,394 --> 00:21:23,829
Want some cocoa
or something?

00:22:01,033 --> 00:22:02,368
Drugs.

00:22:02,435 --> 00:22:04,136
Knowing Eddie's taste
in women, I'd say

00:22:04,203 --> 00:22:06,239
that's a good bet.

00:22:06,305 --> 00:22:09,575
Hey, Catherine,
you want to give me that?

00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:12,545
You shouldn't be
handling evidence.

00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:13,946
You're not on the case.

00:22:24,624 --> 00:22:27,593
Stop it right there.

00:22:29,061 --> 00:22:30,997
STOKES:
Hey, Doc.

00:22:31,063 --> 00:22:33,599
Hey.

00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:36,102
I thought I'd come
and get an update on...

00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:38,504
Stinky here.

00:22:38,571 --> 00:22:39,739
Whew!

00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:40,907
Wow, that's horrible.

00:22:40,973 --> 00:22:43,242
I'm generally immune to
the stench of a decomp,

00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:46,345
but, uh, two weeks of decay
still tickles the vibrassae

00:22:46,412 --> 00:22:47,613
of my nasal vestibule.

00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,615
Yeah, I'll say.

00:22:49,682 --> 00:22:50,816
Hey, what's the
foreign body

00:22:50,883 --> 00:22:51,851
lodged in his femur?

00:22:51,918 --> 00:22:53,586
Crank up the milliamps.

00:22:55,588 --> 00:22:59,325
Whiter than bone.

00:22:59,392 --> 00:23:01,594
Dense like a metal.

00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:04,196
What exactly are we looking at?

00:23:04,263 --> 00:23:06,265
Let's find out.

00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:09,468
Whew!

00:23:22,114 --> 00:23:25,384
I feel like Androcles

00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:27,987
pulling the thorn
from a lion's paw.

00:23:28,054 --> 00:23:30,489
Looks like the tip
of a needle.

00:23:30,556 --> 00:23:32,291
It probably broke off
when it hit the bone.

00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:38,064
BRASS:
I've started to see
into the future.

00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,865
Thanks to credit
card reports, I see

00:23:39,932 --> 00:23:41,601
that our phone victim
booked a room

00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:43,069
at the Tangiers for tonight.

00:23:43,135 --> 00:23:44,770
He was staying
at the Sphere.

00:23:44,837 --> 00:23:46,505
Two hotel rooms
in one night.

00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:47,673
He was a busy boy.

00:23:55,381 --> 00:23:58,918
Hello.

00:23:58,985 --> 00:24:00,019
Hello.

00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:01,520
You're late.

00:24:01,587 --> 00:24:03,623
Not-not that I mind.

00:24:03,689 --> 00:24:06,058
There's two of you?

00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:09,028
We work as a team.

00:24:09,095 --> 00:24:11,764
What's in the kit?

00:24:11,831 --> 00:24:14,267
Latex gloves, cotton swabs,
specimen jars,

00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,269
other evidence-gathering stuff.

00:24:16,335 --> 00:24:18,638
Wait a minute.

00:24:18,704 --> 00:24:20,640
Uh, what's going on here?

00:24:20,706 --> 00:24:21,841
You tell us.

00:24:21,908 --> 00:24:23,209
Oh, my God.

00:24:23,276 --> 00:24:25,545
You guys are cops.

00:24:26,546 --> 00:24:27,880
I'm, um...

00:24:27,947 --> 00:24:29,549
I'm really embarrassed.

00:24:29,615 --> 00:24:32,585
I've never done anything
like this before.

00:24:32,652 --> 00:24:33,753
I <i>swear.</i>

00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:35,821
This room is registered
to Trey Buchman.

00:24:35,888 --> 00:24:37,557
Who are you?

00:24:37,623 --> 00:24:39,358
Do we have to do names?

00:24:39,425 --> 00:24:40,359
Uh-huh.

00:24:40,426 --> 00:24:41,661
Rebecca McCormick.

00:24:41,727 --> 00:24:44,664
Look, I got a number from a guy

00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,567
who was giving out these cards
on the Strip.

00:24:47,633 --> 00:24:49,335
I thought it would be fun.

00:24:49,402 --> 00:24:51,637
I-I don't know
what I was thinking.

00:24:51,704 --> 00:24:54,373
Am I under arrest?

00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,875
Not yet.

00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,381
( <i>beeping and whirring</i> )

00:25:07,086 --> 00:25:08,187
Hey.

00:25:08,254 --> 00:25:09,655
Cracked my D.B.'s laptop.

00:25:09,722 --> 00:25:11,791
Got his appointment book.

00:25:13,192 --> 00:25:14,627
Women's names.

00:25:14,694 --> 00:25:16,629
Hotels.

00:25:16,696 --> 00:25:18,698
Blocks of time.

00:25:18,764 --> 00:25:21,033
You know,
Croix had this sweet apartment

00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,068
and this wad of cash.

00:25:22,134 --> 00:25:23,436
We thought
he was selling drugs.

00:25:23,502 --> 00:25:24,637
He was selling himself.

00:25:24,704 --> 00:25:25,638
Gigolo.

00:25:25,705 --> 00:25:26,806
Paid to get laid.

00:25:26,872 --> 00:25:27,607
So was mine.

00:25:27,673 --> 00:25:28,808
Two victims,

00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:29,976
same profession.

00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:31,277
Ooh.

00:25:31,344 --> 00:25:33,546
What about the needle
you found in the decomp?

00:25:33,613 --> 00:25:35,481
The micrometer pegged it
as a 30-gauge.

00:25:35,548 --> 00:25:39,085
Insulin dependents use needles
that thin.

00:25:39,151 --> 00:25:40,786
Well, the decomp's too severe.

00:25:40,853 --> 00:25:43,489
We'll never get anything
out of tox or the needle.

00:25:43,556 --> 00:25:45,057
I think
we're working the same case.

00:25:47,293 --> 00:25:49,562
Well, good thing
my gigolo was organized.

00:25:49,629 --> 00:25:53,165
He used accounting software
to keep track of his finances.

00:25:53,232 --> 00:25:54,934
Employment history?

00:26:04,143 --> 00:26:06,178
( <i>clears throat</i> )

00:26:11,817 --> 00:26:15,321
( <i>man screams in distance</i> )

00:26:15,388 --> 00:26:18,357
Mr. Grissom,
Captain Brass,

00:26:18,424 --> 00:26:20,326
( <i>screaming continues</i> )
so nice to see you again.

00:26:20,393 --> 00:26:22,662
Good to hear things haven't
changed around here.

00:26:22,728 --> 00:26:24,664
I see you haven't
changed, either.

00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,700
Trey Buchman,
Croix Richards.

00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:30,269
They're both on my payroll.

00:26:30,336 --> 00:26:31,704
Hard workers,
quite skilled.

00:26:31,771 --> 00:26:33,372
They're deceased.

00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:35,374
They'll be missed.

00:26:35,441 --> 00:26:37,410
Last year,
you lost Mona Taylor.

00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:39,111
Now, two more employees.

00:26:39,178 --> 00:26:40,713
It's a risky business.

00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,515
Accusation?

00:26:42,582 --> 00:26:43,883
It's an observation.

00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,018
BRASS:
These guys traded in sex,

00:26:46,085 --> 00:26:47,720
and I know
you don't allow intercourse

00:26:47,787 --> 00:26:49,755
in your domain.

00:26:49,822 --> 00:26:51,757
Now, that is an accusation.

00:26:51,824 --> 00:26:54,627
I profit from
the theatrics
of pleasure,

00:26:54,694 --> 00:26:56,529
allowing people
to play out
their fantasies.

00:26:56,596 --> 00:26:57,663
Trey and Croix

00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,498
were independent
contractors.

00:26:59,565 --> 00:27:00,700
GRISSOM:
Lady Heather,

00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:03,169
what services did they provide?

00:27:05,638 --> 00:27:06,772
WOMAN:
Bad little
pig boy.

00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:08,107
Bad, bad, bad.

00:27:08,174 --> 00:27:11,310
...you naughty,
bad pig.

00:27:11,377 --> 00:27:12,311
( <i>whip cracking</i> )

00:27:12,378 --> 00:27:27,159
Oinky, sloppy pig.

00:27:27,226 --> 00:27:28,160
You're right.

00:27:28,227 --> 00:27:29,228
I deserve to be punished.

00:27:29,295 --> 00:27:30,496
Mommy says no.

00:27:30,563 --> 00:27:32,565
I said, no.

00:27:32,632 --> 00:27:35,234
WOMAN:
Oh...

00:27:35,301 --> 00:27:36,669
Who needs the belt?

00:27:36,736 --> 00:27:39,739
HEATHER:
Here it comes.

00:27:39,805 --> 00:27:40,673
WOMAN:
Say you're sorry.

00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,675
I'm sorry.

00:27:42,742 --> 00:27:44,777
( <i>whip cracking</i> )

00:27:44,844 --> 00:27:46,546
My dominion is also my domain.

00:27:46,612 --> 00:27:48,881
Ladyheather.com.

00:27:48,948 --> 00:27:50,783
So, Buchman and Richards were
down here

00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,084
doing Internet porn, huh?

00:27:52,151 --> 00:27:53,252
Not porn.

00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:55,788
Voyeurism in a brave new world.

00:27:55,855 --> 00:27:57,557
What would Aldous Huxley say?

00:27:57,623 --> 00:27:59,859
If his credit card were valid,
he could say anything

00:27:59,926 --> 00:28:02,161
he wanted at $3.95 a minute.

00:28:02,228 --> 00:28:03,996
Do you like my lipstick?

00:28:04,063 --> 00:28:05,631
( <i>man groaning</i> )

00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:08,534
Why?

00:28:08,601 --> 00:28:10,636
You've been staring at my lips.

00:28:10,703 --> 00:28:11,938
You have lovely lips.

00:28:12,004 --> 00:28:13,172
( <i>whip cracking</i> )

00:28:14,206 --> 00:28:16,409
( <i>whip cracking</i> )

00:28:16,475 --> 00:28:17,877
And a very successful business.

00:28:17,944 --> 00:28:20,179
Thanks. Thanks for your time.

00:28:23,282 --> 00:28:26,018
See you soon.

00:28:31,457 --> 00:28:34,627
VEGA:
So, after
your recital,

00:28:34,694 --> 00:28:36,028
where did your dad take you?

00:28:36,095 --> 00:28:37,196
Leatherbey's.

00:28:37,263 --> 00:28:38,965
He got me a banana split.

00:28:39,031 --> 00:28:40,132
I like whipped cream on mine.

00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:42,001
Did he have
anything to drink?

00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:43,903
Did he have a beer,
a glass of wine?

00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,504
Just water.

00:28:51,777 --> 00:28:54,380
So, it was just the two of you?

00:28:54,447 --> 00:28:56,415
VEGA:
This lady
you told us about--

00:28:56,482 --> 00:28:57,950
the one who was driving,

00:28:58,017 --> 00:29:00,453
the one with the pink hair--
where did you meet her?

00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:02,088
I don't know.

00:29:02,154 --> 00:29:03,389
WILLOW:
You remember, Lindsey.

00:29:03,456 --> 00:29:04,957
Just think about it.

00:29:09,395 --> 00:29:12,265
I fell asleep in the car,

00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:14,133
and I woke up
when we stopped.

00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,068
Was this at a house?

00:29:16,135 --> 00:29:18,104
No. It was a building.

00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,839
SIDLE:
Was it an apartment building,

00:29:19,906 --> 00:29:21,774
maybe, or maybe
an office building?

00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:24,176
I don't know.

00:29:24,243 --> 00:29:26,512
Why did you stop there?

00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,455
Daddy said he had a meeting.
He told me

00:29:36,522 --> 00:29:38,424
to stay in the car and
keep the doors locked.

00:29:38,491 --> 00:29:40,560
You mean he left you
in the car alone.
Catherine...

00:29:40,626 --> 00:29:41,661
Mom, Mom, it's okay.

00:29:41,727 --> 00:29:42,995
I said
I could take care of myself.

00:29:43,062 --> 00:29:44,597
I told him
I could stay
in the car.

00:29:44,664 --> 00:29:45,865
Just don't be mad at him.

00:29:45,932 --> 00:29:47,300
He didn't do anything wrong.

00:29:47,366 --> 00:29:48,868
It's okay, Lindsey.

00:29:48,935 --> 00:29:50,937
Nobody's mad at anybody.

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,474
Can I talk to you
for a second?

00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:07,320
It's okay.

00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:20,499
VEGA:
This lady was
at the building?

00:30:20,566 --> 00:30:23,069
She was outside
in the parking lot.

00:30:23,135 --> 00:30:24,070
Eddie.

00:30:24,136 --> 00:30:25,071
Candeece! Baby!

00:30:25,137 --> 00:30:26,839
Where were you?
What's the matter, honey?

00:30:26,906 --> 00:30:28,207
Sugar, what's the
matter with you?

00:30:28,274 --> 00:30:29,242
Oh!

00:30:29,308 --> 00:30:31,611
This lady
with the pink hair--

00:30:31,677 --> 00:30:34,680
was she your father's
girlfriend?

00:30:38,784 --> 00:30:40,119
I called you
a million times!

00:30:40,186 --> 00:30:41,387
What are you
talking about?

00:30:41,454 --> 00:30:42,989
Why didn't you
answer your phone?

00:30:43,055 --> 00:30:44,590
Maybe.

00:30:44,657 --> 00:30:46,158
Well, he was mad at her.

00:30:46,225 --> 00:30:48,294
And then they,
they were running

00:30:48,361 --> 00:30:49,528
back to the car.

00:30:49,595 --> 00:30:51,364
Daddy was holding his stomach.

00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:56,202
( <i>groaning</i> )

00:30:56,269 --> 00:30:57,870
Daddy, what's wrong?

00:30:57,937 --> 00:30:59,238
It's just a stomachache, honey.

00:30:59,305 --> 00:31:00,539
I'll be fine.

00:31:02,408 --> 00:31:05,511
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

00:31:05,578 --> 00:31:07,513
Willows.

00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,582
Yeah.

00:31:48,917 --> 00:31:52,154
Catherine,
you can't say good-bye

00:31:52,221 --> 00:31:54,657
in an autopsy room.

00:32:23,452 --> 00:32:25,020
Hi, uh...

00:32:25,087 --> 00:32:26,922
Croix Richards
and Trey Buchman.

00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:28,557
Same profession,
same employer,

00:32:28,624 --> 00:32:29,658
same cause of death.

00:32:29,725 --> 00:32:31,260
Yeah.
Insulin poisoning.

00:32:31,327 --> 00:32:33,529
Not your typical
male MO.

00:32:33,595 --> 00:32:35,264
Lady Heather
a suspect?

00:32:35,331 --> 00:32:36,966
I can't rule
anybody out.

00:32:37,032 --> 00:32:41,503
Catherine... I'm sorry
about Eddie and your daughter.

00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:45,774
If, if you'd like to take
some time off or...

00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:47,910
I'm okay.

00:32:47,977 --> 00:32:51,413
Lindsey's...

00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,082
We're okay.

00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:58,087
STOKES:
Hey, Catherine.

00:32:58,153 --> 00:32:59,088
BROWN:
Hey.

00:32:59,154 --> 00:33:00,389
We heard about
what happened.

00:33:00,456 --> 00:33:02,391
I'm so sorry.

00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:03,626
Yeah, if you
or Lindsey

00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:06,428
need anything
at all...

00:33:06,495 --> 00:33:08,397
Thanks, you guys.

00:33:08,464 --> 00:33:10,599
Why don't you
catch us up.

00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:12,301
Yeah.

00:33:12,368 --> 00:33:14,603
STOKES:
Credit card
transactions

00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:15,838
for Lady Heather's
Web Site.

00:33:15,904 --> 00:33:17,706
Both our victims
worked in the chat room.

00:33:17,773 --> 00:33:18,741
We cross-referenced

00:33:18,807 --> 00:33:20,042
their clients.

00:33:20,109 --> 00:33:21,076
They're
all ladies.

00:33:21,143 --> 00:33:22,211
And looks like
both victims

00:33:22,278 --> 00:33:23,946
died approximately

00:33:24,013 --> 00:33:24,947
four weeks
apart.

00:33:25,014 --> 00:33:26,282
BROWN:
Killers
usually don't

00:33:26,348 --> 00:33:27,783
stray too far from home.

00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,752
Especially for
repeat crimes.

00:33:29,818 --> 00:33:32,755
Yeah, I'm squeezing
the Las Vegas search area.

00:33:36,358 --> 00:33:37,893
Got a vial full
of blue boogers.

00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,328
GHB with food coloring.

00:33:39,395 --> 00:33:40,729
That's a date rape
drug.

00:33:40,796 --> 00:33:41,730
Not anymore.

00:33:41,797 --> 00:33:43,165
You mix it with
the right stimulant,

00:33:43,232 --> 00:33:44,733
like meth, you got
a great party drug.

00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,068
SIDLE:
Everyone's a chemist.

00:33:46,135 --> 00:33:47,703
Thanks.

00:33:52,107 --> 00:33:54,109
GRISSOM:
You know, we found
a dark hair

00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,445
in Trey Buchman's hotel room
at the Sphere.

00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:00,816
I'll exclude everyone
with light hair.

00:34:07,323 --> 00:34:08,257
Whoa.

00:34:08,324 --> 00:34:09,091
Stop.

00:34:09,158 --> 00:34:10,492
Huh.

00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:14,029
Rebecca McCormick.
235 Desert Ranch Road.

00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:16,365
First time, my ass.

00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:35,684
Hi.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:34:35,751 --> 00:34:38,053
So, what can
I do to help out

00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,388
the Las Vegas
Crime Lab?

00:34:39,455 --> 00:34:40,389
You could tell us about

00:34:40,456 --> 00:34:41,890
your relationship
with Croix Richards.

00:34:41,957 --> 00:34:44,360
Well, uh, I hired
Croix Richards

00:34:44,426 --> 00:34:46,128
to dominate Rebecca.

00:34:47,262 --> 00:34:48,030
Would you like

00:34:48,097 --> 00:34:49,331
a chocolate?

00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:50,833
Uh, they're Godiva.

00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:52,601
WILLOWS:
No, thanks.

00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:54,570
I guess you
could say

00:34:54,637 --> 00:34:56,538
that Mr. Richards
worked for me.

00:34:56,605 --> 00:34:58,107
We were hoping that

00:34:58,173 --> 00:35:00,576
he might help ease
some of Rebecca's

00:35:00,643 --> 00:35:02,444
sexual difficulties.

00:35:02,511 --> 00:35:04,713
WILLOWS:
Extra-marital sex
to help your

00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,048
relationship problems?

00:35:06,115 --> 00:35:09,051
The problem wasn't
with our relationship,

00:35:09,118 --> 00:35:10,252
it was with
my wife's

00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:11,320
lack of experience.

00:35:11,387 --> 00:35:13,355
GRISSOM:
Which Mr. Richards

00:35:13,422 --> 00:35:14,957
helped you with?

00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:17,393
Yes.

00:35:17,459 --> 00:35:20,029
First over the Internet and
then we, uh, we met with him

00:35:20,095 --> 00:35:22,698
a few times.

00:35:22,765 --> 00:35:23,866
We?

00:35:23,932 --> 00:35:25,534
Yeah, yes.

00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:27,002
I participated
in the sessions, yes.

00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:31,440
CROIX:
Do you take this man
to be your wedded husband?

00:35:31,507 --> 00:35:33,575
Love honor and obey.

00:35:33,642 --> 00:35:34,510
Say it!

00:35:35,844 --> 00:35:37,613
And these sessions

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,248
were held
at Lady Heather's?

00:35:39,315 --> 00:35:40,783
Yes.

00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:43,786
Lady Heather thought it would
be best if I was involved.

00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:45,154
I'm sure secrets would've

00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,957
made the problem worse,
at that point.

00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:51,293
Mrs. McCormick, did
you meet Trey Buchman

00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,996
at Lady Heather's?

00:35:54,063 --> 00:35:55,264
Oh, I'm sorry, who?

00:35:55,331 --> 00:35:57,733
GRISSOM:
He worked for
Lady Heather as well.

00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,934
He's also dead.

00:35:59,001 --> 00:36:00,102
Oh...

00:36:00,169 --> 00:36:01,337
I don't know
who Trey Buchman is.

00:36:01,403 --> 00:36:02,972
Your wife does.
Oh.

00:36:03,038 --> 00:36:07,242
I met Trey
on Lady Heather's Web Site.

00:36:07,309 --> 00:36:09,678
Our encounters
were only on-line.

00:36:09,745 --> 00:36:11,447
Like this?

00:36:11,513 --> 00:36:13,015
Is this okay?

00:36:13,082 --> 00:36:14,116
No, it's not okay!

00:36:14,183 --> 00:36:15,851
Don't you know how to listen,
you stupid bitch?!

00:36:15,918 --> 00:36:18,287
GRISSOM:
And the night
you and I met

00:36:18,354 --> 00:36:19,855
at the Tangiers?

00:36:21,023 --> 00:36:23,425
Croix was fun.

00:36:23,492 --> 00:36:27,096
Uh, I wanted more experience.
Variation.

00:36:27,162 --> 00:36:28,931
I made a date
with Trey.

00:36:28,998 --> 00:36:30,566
He never
showed up.

00:36:34,269 --> 00:36:36,372
Well, Mrs. McCormick,

00:36:36,438 --> 00:36:38,007
I'd like to get
a sample

00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:39,441
of your hair and DNA

00:36:39,508 --> 00:36:41,343
for comparison.

00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:42,778
Rebecca will give you
anything

00:36:42,845 --> 00:36:44,480
that you need.

00:36:46,015 --> 00:36:47,716
( <i>bowl clanks</i> )

00:37:40,936 --> 00:37:43,305
( <i>jackhammer pounding</i> )

00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:50,446
Yeah, I can put you in touch
with her manager, Eddie Willows.

00:37:50,512 --> 00:37:52,047
Guy owes me
a call.

00:37:52,114 --> 00:37:53,182
Make that five calls.

00:37:53,248 --> 00:37:54,183
If you talk to him,

00:37:54,249 --> 00:37:55,784
tell him he's got,
like, eight hours

00:37:55,851 --> 00:37:56,852
of studio fees due.

00:37:56,919 --> 00:37:58,587
The penalties are running, okay?

00:37:58,654 --> 00:38:00,356
We've already seen him.
He's in the morgue.

00:38:00,422 --> 00:38:01,757
Oh, that makes sense
why he wasn't

00:38:01,824 --> 00:38:03,058
here last night.

00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:04,393
High-strung singer,

00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,261
no manager,
that's always trouble.

00:38:17,506 --> 00:38:19,008
I hate this!

00:38:19,074 --> 00:38:20,142
This sucks!

00:38:20,209 --> 00:38:21,176
Okay?

00:38:21,243 --> 00:38:22,411
Where is Eddie?

00:38:22,478 --> 00:38:23,412
I need Eddie here.

00:38:23,479 --> 00:38:24,413
Get back in the booth.

00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,481
Where are you?

00:38:25,547 --> 00:38:27,082
I need you here now.

00:38:27,149 --> 00:38:28,884
I cannot do this
without help.

00:38:28,951 --> 00:38:30,653
Can I have a little
privacy, please?

00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:32,154
Would you go in there
and learn how to do your job?

00:38:32,221 --> 00:38:33,289
It sounds terrible
in there, anyways.

00:38:33,355 --> 00:38:34,290
She started ragging on me.

00:38:34,356 --> 00:38:35,991
I didn't need the hot air,
so I came back in.

00:38:36,058 --> 00:38:38,093
That's a cut, Enrique.

00:38:39,128 --> 00:38:40,629
Let's take it from the bridge.

00:38:40,696 --> 00:38:42,498
Eddie was just in it
for the quick score.

00:38:42,564 --> 00:38:45,301
Cut a demo,
sell a contract,

00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:47,670
get a ride on the charts
and you just ride that wave.

00:38:47,736 --> 00:38:48,904
This girl was different.

00:38:48,971 --> 00:38:50,239
Yeah, he was banging her.

00:38:50,306 --> 00:38:52,274
Yeah, but he had
something for her,

00:38:52,341 --> 00:38:54,109
knowing how much
potential she had.

00:38:54,176 --> 00:38:55,277
I never seen Eddie so dedicated.

00:38:55,344 --> 00:38:57,179
Nothing was going to stop him
from making her a star.

00:38:57,246 --> 00:38:59,581
Except maybe a .22 round
in his gut.

00:38:59,648 --> 00:39:01,850
Stop, stop, stop.
That's a cut, Enrique.

00:39:01,917 --> 00:39:04,019
Whoa. It sounds good from where
I'm standing-- what's up?

00:39:04,086 --> 00:39:05,654
The problem isn't
the vocals, man,

00:39:05,721 --> 00:39:07,089
it's the extra bass line
I keep getting

00:39:07,156 --> 00:39:08,290
from the Village People outside

00:39:08,357 --> 00:39:09,658
with that damn
jackhammer.

00:39:09,725 --> 00:39:10,659
All right, Enrique,

00:39:10,726 --> 00:39:12,294
let's pick it up
from the second chorus.

00:39:12,361 --> 00:39:14,463
Aren't recording studios
supposed to be soundproof?

00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:15,998
Lady, if the guy
standing next to you

00:39:16,065 --> 00:39:17,333
is Clive Davis,
instead of a cop,

00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:18,334
it would be.

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,636
After Candeece left, did
you guys keep recording?

00:39:20,703 --> 00:39:21,870
Um, yeah, a few more hours.

00:39:21,937 --> 00:39:23,372
We were redoing a drum track.

00:39:26,275 --> 00:39:29,178
We're going to need
to take a look at those tapes.

00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:30,980
BROWN:
Okay, the hair on the left

00:39:31,046 --> 00:39:33,716
is from Trey Buchman's room
at the Sphere hotel.

00:39:33,782 --> 00:39:34,783
The hair on the right

00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,852
is a sample we took
from Rebecca McCormick.

00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:40,623
Cuticles on both
are shiny and smooth.

00:39:40,689 --> 00:39:43,626
Telltale signs
the hair has been treated.

00:39:43,692 --> 00:39:46,061
The cortex isn't letting
any light through.

00:39:46,128 --> 00:39:48,397
It lets us know
the hair's been colored.

00:39:48,464 --> 00:39:50,799
The medullas are continuous.

00:39:50,866 --> 00:39:52,668
I can't be definitive
without DNA,

00:39:52,735 --> 00:39:55,070
but, uh, both pairs
are consistent.

00:39:55,137 --> 00:39:56,839
They look like
Rebecca McCormick's.

00:39:58,741 --> 00:40:00,142
WILLOWS:
So she lied
to you guys

00:40:00,209 --> 00:40:02,211
at the hotel,
she lied to us at the house.

00:40:02,278 --> 00:40:03,646
She's been with him,

00:40:03,712 --> 00:40:04,647
not just online.

00:40:04,713 --> 00:40:05,681
But her husband

00:40:05,748 --> 00:40:07,316
only knew about
the guy he hired,

00:40:07,383 --> 00:40:08,450
Croix Richards.

00:40:08,517 --> 00:40:12,321
He had no idea
that she hired Trey Buchman.

00:40:12,388 --> 00:40:15,824
HEATHER:
Steven McCormick wanted
his wife to have a session.

00:40:15,891 --> 00:40:17,259
It's not uncommon.

00:40:17,326 --> 00:40:19,028
When a client
achieves liberation,

00:40:19,094 --> 00:40:21,830
they often want their spouse
to share that feeling.

00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:24,400
Though in this
particular instance

00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:26,735
I advised the husband
to pursue avenues more suited

00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:28,337
to the temperament
of his marriage.

00:40:28,404 --> 00:40:30,306
I guess you couldn't say no.

00:40:30,372 --> 00:40:31,607
I learned that Mr. McCormick

00:40:31,674 --> 00:40:33,342
is an investor
in your Internet site.

00:40:33,409 --> 00:40:35,377
That's a matter
of public record.

00:40:35,444 --> 00:40:37,646
Did he ever tell
you, specifically,

00:40:37,713 --> 00:40:39,581
what his wife's
problem was?

00:40:39,648 --> 00:40:41,083
The fault lay
not in his wife

00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,117
but in himself.

00:40:42,184 --> 00:40:43,686
Steven believed
his wife

00:40:43,752 --> 00:40:46,255
was repressed, but
once she opened up...

00:40:46,322 --> 00:40:48,891
A Pandora's Box?

00:40:48,958 --> 00:40:52,394
All the evils of
their marriage unleashed?

00:40:53,562 --> 00:40:54,663
May I?

00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:55,597
You may.

00:40:55,664 --> 00:40:56,598
Thank you,
Lady Heather.

00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:03,505
Steven came to me
three years ago

00:41:03,572 --> 00:41:05,107
in a state of confusion.

00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:08,010
I helped him clarify
his need for dominance.

00:41:08,077 --> 00:41:11,080
You will control her
only as well

00:41:11,146 --> 00:41:12,147
as you can read her.

00:41:15,351 --> 00:41:16,485
Now read.

00:41:23,025 --> 00:41:25,060
Our work enabled him to marry.

00:41:25,127 --> 00:41:28,263
But he chose a woman
who didn't understand

00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:32,267
the dynamics of a
dominant-submissive
relationship.

00:41:32,334 --> 00:41:34,403
Unfortunately, the
language we speak in here

00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:37,106
doesn't necessarily translate
to the world out there.

00:41:37,172 --> 00:41:40,276
No, in here, the submissive
has the power.

00:41:40,342 --> 00:41:43,045
All he has to do
is say the safety word

00:41:43,112 --> 00:41:44,680
and everything stops.

00:41:47,082 --> 00:41:48,851
Very good, Mr. Grissom.

00:41:48,917 --> 00:41:52,488
I'm just repeating
what I've heard.

00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:54,256
You're a good listener.

00:41:54,323 --> 00:41:55,624
Part of the job.

00:41:57,693 --> 00:41:59,495
So this is work?

00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:00,796
Yes.

00:42:00,863 --> 00:42:02,564
But I value your insight.

00:42:02,631 --> 00:42:04,800
I'm flattered.

00:42:04,867 --> 00:42:08,604
But you already seem to know
the answers to your questions.

00:42:08,671 --> 00:42:12,775
You keep me in proximity
when I walk away

00:42:12,841 --> 00:42:15,511
and when I'm close,
you watch my lips.

00:42:18,681 --> 00:42:20,849
Are you losing your hearing?

00:42:22,985 --> 00:42:25,287
I'm losing my balance.

00:42:25,354 --> 00:42:27,256
Your sense of self?

00:42:27,323 --> 00:42:29,124
No.

00:42:29,191 --> 00:42:31,026
I know who I am.

00:42:31,093 --> 00:42:33,195
Do you?

00:42:33,262 --> 00:42:36,632
Yes, I do.

00:42:53,082 --> 00:42:56,819
You can always say stop.

00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:01,156
So can you.

00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:11,125
Eddie's my manager.

00:43:11,192 --> 00:43:12,760
It's no big secret.

00:43:12,827 --> 00:43:14,462
We were supposed to be
working last night,

00:43:14,529 --> 00:43:16,497
and the jerk
blew me off.

00:43:16,564 --> 00:43:18,766
VEGA:
So you never saw him
last night?

00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:20,801
No.
What happened
to your wrist?

00:43:22,336 --> 00:43:23,304
Oh, uh...

00:43:23,371 --> 00:43:24,405
I got, uh...

00:43:24,472 --> 00:43:25,406
um...

00:43:25,473 --> 00:43:26,741
Because, uh,
according

00:43:26,807 --> 00:43:28,476
to Desert Palms
Emergency Room,

00:43:28,543 --> 00:43:30,378
you came in last night
with a fracture of the ulna.

00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:31,679
It's a common injury

00:43:31,746 --> 00:43:33,781
in car accidents--
air bag specific.

00:43:36,717 --> 00:43:39,320
SIDLE ( <i>over speaker</i> ):
Air bags are packed

00:43:39,387 --> 00:43:40,988
with cornstarch or talc.

00:43:41,055 --> 00:43:42,490
It helps them deploy.

00:43:42,557 --> 00:43:44,759
It also wreaks havoc
on the eyes.

00:43:44,825 --> 00:43:45,860
We know you saw
Eddie last night.

00:43:45,927 --> 00:43:48,996
We know that you
were driving his car.

00:43:49,063 --> 00:43:50,498
It all happened so fast,

00:43:50,565 --> 00:43:51,866
you know?

00:43:51,933 --> 00:43:54,402
One minute I was,
I was just outside

00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:57,338
getting some air
and thinking, you know?

00:43:57,405 --> 00:43:59,473
And then... the next,

00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:03,010
my manager is stumbling
towards me, bleeding.

00:44:03,077 --> 00:44:04,011
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:44:04,078 --> 00:44:05,646
Candeece, baby,
I'm shot!

00:44:05,713 --> 00:44:06,881
Eddie! Oh, my God!

00:44:06,948 --> 00:44:09,383
( <i>gasping</i> )
I'll get you
in the car.

00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:11,686
Everything's going
to be okay, honey.

00:44:11,752 --> 00:44:12,587
Okay, don't be afraid.

00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:14,455
Sounds pretty heroic.

00:44:14,522 --> 00:44:16,023
Not really.

00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:19,460
When you're intimate
with somebody,

00:44:19,527 --> 00:44:22,897
you can't imagine
life without them.

00:44:22,964 --> 00:44:25,566
We were partners.

00:44:25,633 --> 00:44:27,735
I <i>loved</i> him.

00:44:27,802 --> 00:44:29,704
I thought I was going to die.

00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:32,874
There were two other
people in the car.

00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,243
That's what I meant, you know?

00:44:35,309 --> 00:44:37,945
I thought we were <i>all</i>
going to die.

00:44:38,012 --> 00:44:39,213
Search and Rescue
found Eddie's body

00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,281
100 yards downstream.

00:44:40,348 --> 00:44:42,683
See, that's where it gets
a little less heroic--

00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,285
we found Lindsey <i>alone</i>

00:44:44,352 --> 00:44:45,520
in a sinking car.

00:44:45,586 --> 00:44:47,355
I tried to get Eddie out.

00:44:47,421 --> 00:44:50,157
He was unconscious,
and that... that kid

00:44:50,224 --> 00:44:51,726
kept screaming.

00:44:51,792 --> 00:44:54,495
The current was really strong
and we got swept downstream.

00:44:54,562 --> 00:44:56,130
What was I supposed to do?

00:44:56,197 --> 00:44:58,733
Get to a phone, call the
cops, call an ambulance,

00:44:58,799 --> 00:45:01,469
anything, actually,
other than what you did.

00:45:01,536 --> 00:45:02,870
I am just one person.

00:45:02,937 --> 00:45:06,007
Eddie is my priority,
not that...

00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:09,443
that stupid, screaming
little brat.

00:45:11,045 --> 00:45:12,380
I tried, I...

00:45:12,446 --> 00:45:14,482
You even think about
my daughter again,
I'll kill you.

00:45:14,549 --> 00:45:15,750
I will kill you.

00:45:15,816 --> 00:45:17,185
I will hunt you
down and put...

00:45:17,251 --> 00:45:18,452
I will put you
in the ground!
Catherine.

00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:19,654
You saw that.

00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,222
She threatened me!

00:45:21,289 --> 00:45:22,156
I want a lawyer.

00:45:22,223 --> 00:45:24,392
What the hell
are you doing?

00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:27,361
Do you know where
you're at right now?

00:45:27,428 --> 00:45:29,230
I've been here a <i>lot</i>
longer than you...

00:45:29,297 --> 00:45:30,531
And you should
know better.

00:45:30,598 --> 00:45:31,966
And I wouldn't
have to be here

00:45:32,033 --> 00:45:33,701
if you were doing
your job properly.

00:45:33,768 --> 00:45:36,103
There is a difference
between me doing my job

00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:37,905
and you wanting to do it for me.

00:45:37,972 --> 00:45:39,440
You don't want
to get the job done.

00:45:39,507 --> 00:45:40,975
What you want, right now,
is revenge.

00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:42,810
You're going to tell me
what I want, huh?

00:45:42,877 --> 00:45:44,145
Go home, Catherine.

00:45:44,212 --> 00:45:45,746
Be with your daughter.

00:45:45,813 --> 00:45:47,715
She's the one
that needs you.

00:45:57,525 --> 00:45:59,460
GRISSOM:
What did you consider this?

00:45:59,527 --> 00:46:02,363
A little civility
before work, I think?

00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:04,599
Or a ritual to
put us at ease.

00:46:04,665 --> 00:46:07,335
Or how about "In
custom and ceremony,

00:46:07,401 --> 00:46:09,670
are innocence
and beauty born."

00:46:09,737 --> 00:46:12,373
Yeats...

00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,375
"Prayer for My Daughter."

00:46:14,442 --> 00:46:16,644
Or our morning.

00:46:16,711 --> 00:46:17,745
Cream?

00:46:17,812 --> 00:46:19,146
Please.

00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:24,352
Thank you.

00:46:24,418 --> 00:46:25,386
Sugar?

00:46:25,453 --> 00:46:27,221
I'm diabetic.

00:46:30,625 --> 00:46:31,726
Type One?

00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:33,928
Mm-hmm.

00:46:33,995 --> 00:46:35,029
Injections.

00:46:35,096 --> 00:46:36,831
Used to mean injections.

00:46:36,898 --> 00:46:39,300
I changed to a pressure syringe.

00:46:42,737 --> 00:46:44,071
Recently?

00:46:44,138 --> 00:46:45,072
Mm, a few weeks ago.

00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:46,741
Oh, it's a fascinating
instrument;

00:46:46,807 --> 00:46:48,075
would you like to see it?

00:46:50,211 --> 00:46:51,412
Yes, I would.

00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,949
But I'm afraid
I'll need a warrant.

00:46:57,185 --> 00:46:59,754
Excuse me.

00:47:07,461 --> 00:47:08,396
It's Grissom.

00:47:08,462 --> 00:47:09,864
I need you to write paper

00:47:09,931 --> 00:47:12,266
on Lady Heather's
medical paraphernalia--

00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:15,903
specifically, an insulin kit
and syringes.

00:47:17,505 --> 00:47:18,873
I'm already there.

00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,842
I'll wait.

00:47:25,012 --> 00:47:28,449
I think I just heard
you say "stop."

00:47:30,618 --> 00:47:32,887
BRASS:
You lied to us,
Mrs. McCormick.

00:47:32,954 --> 00:47:34,088
You said

00:47:34,155 --> 00:47:37,992
you only engaged
in on-line sex
with Trey Buchman.

00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:39,861
Your hair has
a similar morphology

00:47:39,927 --> 00:47:42,997
to the hair that we found
in Mr. Buchman's hotel suite.

00:47:43,064 --> 00:47:46,334
Well, "similar"
doesn't mean me.

00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,436
No, but the DNA
we also recovered

00:47:48,503 --> 00:47:50,938
from under the sheets
does mean you.

00:47:51,005 --> 00:47:53,674
BRASS:
Sounds like
a physical encounter to me.

00:47:56,043 --> 00:47:57,678
So, since I pay for sex,

00:47:57,745 --> 00:47:59,580
I must also be a murderer?

00:47:59,647 --> 00:48:03,017
No, it's just that everybody
you pay for sex ends up dead.

00:48:03,084 --> 00:48:05,820
I don't like you.

00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:08,956
Well, I guess I'll have
to live with that.

00:48:09,023 --> 00:48:13,060
Here's something else
you might not like.

00:48:13,127 --> 00:48:15,163
Two months ago,
your bank records

00:48:15,229 --> 00:48:17,698
show cash withdrawals
totaling $50,000.

00:48:17,765 --> 00:48:19,333
BROWN:
The same amount
that we found

00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,435
in Croix Richards' apartment.

00:48:21,502 --> 00:48:24,272
Croix wasn't even
half that good.

00:48:24,338 --> 00:48:26,874
Of course, that's
still better
than my husband.

00:48:30,745 --> 00:48:32,880
You used to work for
Latona Pharmaceuticals, right?

00:48:32,947 --> 00:48:34,448
Years ago.

00:48:34,515 --> 00:48:36,651
You sold synthetic insulin.

00:48:36,717 --> 00:48:40,555
All right. Mm-hmm.

00:48:40,621 --> 00:48:44,192
We've had our fun, but
I'm stopping it now.

00:48:44,258 --> 00:48:45,693
Any other questions
you have

00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,995
can be directed
to my lawyer.

00:48:49,964 --> 00:48:52,033
Well, modern recording's
all digital

00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:54,602
so each track's recorded
in a separate data file.

00:48:54,669 --> 00:48:56,437
By looking
at the file modification times,

00:48:56,504 --> 00:48:58,840
we can approximate
which tracks were recorded

00:48:58,906 --> 00:49:00,041
near the time
of the shooting.

00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:01,909
Catherine left Eddie
at 5:30 p.m.

00:49:01,976 --> 00:49:03,778
Lindsey's first call
was logged at 10:55.

00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,648
Let's see, well...

00:49:07,715 --> 00:49:11,152
only two tracks were laid down
during that time interval.

00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:14,755
"7:41: acoustic guitar...

00:49:14,822 --> 00:49:15,890
10:38: drum track."

00:49:15,957 --> 00:49:17,391
Let's look at the drum track.

00:49:17,458 --> 00:49:19,894
( <i>medium-tempo drumbeat playing)</i>

00:49:19,961 --> 00:49:22,497
There's the kit drum.

00:49:22,563 --> 00:49:24,098
So any irregularity
in the pattern

00:49:24,165 --> 00:49:25,666
could be from
an outside source.

00:49:25,733 --> 00:49:26,901
Yeah.

00:49:26,968 --> 00:49:27,935
Right here.

00:49:28,002 --> 00:49:30,705
A sudden change
in amplitude.

00:49:30,771 --> 00:49:32,740
Can you isolate it?

00:49:32,807 --> 00:49:34,575
Yeah.

00:49:34,642 --> 00:49:38,012
( <i>distant bang amid drumming)</i>

00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,181
Sounds like gunfire.

00:49:40,248 --> 00:49:41,482
I'll play it again.

00:49:44,252 --> 00:49:45,820
( <i>distant bang amid drumming)</i>

00:49:47,755 --> 00:49:50,691
Let me take out
the drums.

00:49:54,262 --> 00:49:56,631
( <i>two distant bangs</i> )

00:49:56,697 --> 00:49:59,333
( <i>faint whirring</i> )

00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,434
What is that?

00:50:00,501 --> 00:50:03,638
Feels like an engine.

00:50:03,704 --> 00:50:04,805
V-twin, maybe.

00:50:04,872 --> 00:50:06,774
Must have been
somebody else there.

00:50:06,841 --> 00:50:08,075
You think
we got a witness?

00:50:08,142 --> 00:50:09,377
Or a suspect.

00:50:09,443 --> 00:50:10,077
Hey...

00:50:10,144 --> 00:50:11,112
I was able to pull

00:50:11,179 --> 00:50:12,547
the phone records
for Candeece.

00:50:12,613 --> 00:50:13,781
She made six calls that night.

00:50:13,848 --> 00:50:14,982
The first five went to Eddie.

00:50:15,049 --> 00:50:16,284
But not the last one.

00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:17,485
You got an address?

00:50:17,552 --> 00:50:19,053
MAN:
I get all kind of calls.

00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,422
It could've been a girl
that I slept with.

00:50:21,489 --> 00:50:23,024
Or a girl that
I didn't sleep with.

00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:24,358
Could've been
a wrong number.

00:50:24,425 --> 00:50:26,661
Since when do wrong
numbers last for
four minutes?

00:50:26,727 --> 00:50:28,329
You hear a sexy voice
on the phone,

00:50:28,396 --> 00:50:29,997
what are you gonna do,
you gonna hang up?

00:50:30,064 --> 00:50:31,165
So you do remember
the call.

00:50:31,232 --> 00:50:33,367
I like your Harley.

00:50:35,203 --> 00:50:36,637
Look, Kiner,

00:50:36,704 --> 00:50:38,339
you're on parole;
you got no rights.

00:50:38,406 --> 00:50:39,507
Looking at two strikes.

00:50:39,574 --> 00:50:40,875
I'm not trying to
pull a fast ball

00:50:40,942 --> 00:50:42,210
on you, but it's
not the first time

00:50:42,276 --> 00:50:43,244
you've talked
to Candeece.

00:50:43,311 --> 00:50:44,812
KINER:
So maybe me and Candy
are friends.

00:50:44,879 --> 00:50:46,113
VEGA:
<i>Were</i> friends.

00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,316
You guys used to talk
once a day.

00:50:48,382 --> 00:50:50,985
Then she stopped calling you,
until last night.

00:50:51,052 --> 00:50:52,220
People change.

00:50:52,286 --> 00:50:56,624
Fell into
a bad element.

00:50:56,691 --> 00:50:59,694
Mr. Kiner, do you
own this house?

00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,095
My father left it
to me.

00:51:01,162 --> 00:51:02,997
Your father have a drug problem?

00:51:03,064 --> 00:51:05,032
We found GHB in your garage.

00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:06,467
"Georgia Home Boy."

00:51:06,534 --> 00:51:07,969
Tell us what happened
with Eddie.

00:51:08,035 --> 00:51:10,404
Candy needed "help."

00:51:11,405 --> 00:51:12,006
EDDIE:
Hey, hey, hey!

00:51:12,073 --> 00:51:13,307
What are you doing here?

00:51:13,374 --> 00:51:15,076
What are you selling
her drugs for?

00:51:15,142 --> 00:51:16,077
What are you doing?

00:51:16,143 --> 00:51:17,111
I wanted you clean.

00:51:17,178 --> 00:51:18,579
Hey, please...

00:51:18,646 --> 00:51:19,614
What do you want,
huh?

00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,214
This what you want?

00:51:20,281 --> 00:51:21,816
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:51:21,883 --> 00:51:22,817
I got on my hog.

00:51:22,884 --> 00:51:23,985
I got the hell
out of there.

00:51:24,051 --> 00:51:25,186
What do you expect me
to do?

00:51:25,253 --> 00:51:26,521
Go back to the joint
for her?

00:51:30,525 --> 00:51:32,260
Cuff him.

00:51:35,696 --> 00:51:36,898
Quid pro quo, right?

00:51:36,964 --> 00:51:38,866
Steven invests
in your business,

00:51:38,933 --> 00:51:42,203
you kill the two guys
who are messing around
with his wife.

00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:44,238
I could help you,
Mr. Brass...

00:51:44,305 --> 00:51:45,907
with your inadequacy.

00:51:45,973 --> 00:51:48,643
You know,
I'd like that, Lady H.

00:51:48,709 --> 00:51:50,511
It's tough being me.

00:51:52,914 --> 00:51:55,082
I'd like to feel
more secure

00:51:55,149 --> 00:51:57,952
in my role
as a homicide detective.

00:51:58,019 --> 00:52:00,721
You know what really
gets me wild?

00:52:00,788 --> 00:52:02,557
The truth.

00:52:02,623 --> 00:52:04,859
Are you up for that?

00:52:06,961 --> 00:52:08,563
( <i>over speaker</i> ):
Mr. Grissom collected samples

00:52:08,629 --> 00:52:10,932
of my insulin.

00:52:10,998 --> 00:52:14,268
He's undoubtedly identified it
as non-synthetic.

00:52:14,335 --> 00:52:15,803
BRASS:
He told me it was
beef insulin.

00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:17,004
HEATHER:
Which, I take it,

00:52:17,071 --> 00:52:18,906
matches the insulin
found in the two victims.

00:52:18,973 --> 00:52:20,374
BRASS:
Do you know

00:52:20,441 --> 00:52:23,077
that only seven percent of
diabetics in this country

00:52:23,144 --> 00:52:24,545
use an animal-based
insulin?

00:52:24,612 --> 00:52:26,514
They import yours
from Great Britain.

00:52:26,581 --> 00:52:28,616
HEATHER:
Which narrows the field
down even further.

00:52:28,683 --> 00:52:29,951
BRASS:
Right into
your dominion.

00:52:30,017 --> 00:52:31,786
My personal area is open.

00:52:31,853 --> 00:52:35,723
Anyone could've walked right in
and stolen from me.

00:52:37,258 --> 00:52:38,993
Is it something
I said?

00:52:41,996 --> 00:52:44,265
I'm disappointed in you.

00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:49,170
But not surprised.

00:52:49,237 --> 00:52:50,972
You fear me...

00:52:51,038 --> 00:52:54,542
because I've committed
the one unforgivable act.

00:52:54,609 --> 00:52:56,777
No, it's more
like two acts...

00:52:56,844 --> 00:52:58,846
of murder.

00:53:01,282 --> 00:53:03,084
I know you.

00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:05,086
And I know that
in your heart,

00:53:05,152 --> 00:53:07,188
you don't believe
I did this.

00:53:07,255 --> 00:53:09,657
BRASS:
Lady Heather...

00:53:09,724 --> 00:53:11,425
this has nothing
to do with heart.

00:53:11,492 --> 00:53:12,994
It's all about
the evidence.

00:54:11,853 --> 00:54:12,987
Greg...

00:54:13,054 --> 00:54:15,389
I need you to process these
right away.

00:54:15,456 --> 00:54:17,058
Priority.

00:54:17,124 --> 00:54:18,125
Grissom!

00:54:18,192 --> 00:54:20,228
We got a problem.

00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:31,973
WILLOWS:
Stranglings
are intimate.

00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:33,841
Crime of passion.

00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,082
Or not.

00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:01,768
Mr. McCormick...

00:55:01,835 --> 00:55:04,571
were you the one
who found your wife?

00:55:04,638 --> 00:55:06,873
Yes.

00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:08,408
On the stairs?

00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:11,244
Yes.

00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:13,313
May I see your
hands, please?

00:55:22,989 --> 00:55:24,391
Other side.

00:55:31,731 --> 00:55:33,133
They look clean.

00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:35,702
Mm.

00:55:35,769 --> 00:55:38,738
Should they be?

00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:43,944
I don't know.

00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:47,581
If it were my spouse,
I would've touched the body.

00:55:47,647 --> 00:55:50,350
Mm. I didn't.

00:56:04,064 --> 00:56:06,366
Kiner is a drug dealer.

00:56:06,433 --> 00:56:08,268
Your drug dealer.

00:56:08,335 --> 00:56:09,269
No. Not anymore.

00:56:09,336 --> 00:56:11,037
Eddie got me off
all that stuff.

00:56:11,104 --> 00:56:12,272
VEGA:
You called Kiner.

00:56:12,339 --> 00:56:13,340
He came here.

00:56:13,406 --> 00:56:14,975
I tried to call Eddie.

00:56:15,041 --> 00:56:16,243
He had his phone off.

00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:17,978
He was with his
pain-in-the-ass daughter

00:56:18,044 --> 00:56:19,946
and that psycho
ex-wife of his.

00:56:20,013 --> 00:56:21,648
I was just alone in
front of a microphone

00:56:21,715 --> 00:56:24,050
with my whole career
riding on a demo.

00:56:24,117 --> 00:56:26,219
It's none of your business.

00:56:26,286 --> 00:56:27,020
Hey, Eddie.

00:56:27,087 --> 00:56:28,321
What?
( <i>gunshot</i> )

00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:30,123
( <i>grunts</i> )
Oh, my God!

00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:32,025
I thought Eddie wasn't coming.

00:56:32,993 --> 00:56:36,630
I guess he was just late.

00:56:41,167 --> 00:56:44,037
The material we found in
Rebecca McCormick's wound

00:56:44,104 --> 00:56:48,208
was nylon thread
with fragments of
ostrich feather.

00:56:48,275 --> 00:56:49,442
Oh, I know that look.

00:56:49,509 --> 00:56:50,911
We're going back
to Lady Heather's.

00:56:50,977 --> 00:56:52,279
I can take care
of this myself.

00:56:52,345 --> 00:56:53,847
Gil, do me a favor.
Get a sports car.

00:56:53,914 --> 00:56:56,249
It's a lot cheaper
and easier to handle.

00:56:56,316 --> 00:56:57,617
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

00:57:00,587 --> 00:57:02,255
I'd like to come in.

00:57:02,322 --> 00:57:04,257
Of course you would.

00:57:04,324 --> 00:57:05,525
Say the magic word.

00:57:05,592 --> 00:57:08,128
Warrant?

00:57:08,194 --> 00:57:09,829
We don't have one.

00:57:09,896 --> 00:57:13,867
GRISSOM:
The, uh, submissive
that was in here yesterday

00:57:13,934 --> 00:57:15,735
was wearing
a feather boa.

00:57:15,802 --> 00:57:16,970
That would be Chloe.

00:57:17,037 --> 00:57:18,638
Chloe, uh...?

00:57:18,705 --> 00:57:20,340
Chloe Samms.

00:57:20,407 --> 00:57:22,309
She uses it as a garrote--

00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:23,643
a way to control her breathing

00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:26,479
to heighten the experience
for the dominant client.

00:57:26,546 --> 00:57:28,181
Hmm.

00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:45,398
Same scent

00:57:45,465 --> 00:57:46,900
as Trey Buchman's crime scene.

00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:50,070
Remember the
strawberry foam?

00:57:50,136 --> 00:57:52,672
Do these belong
to Chloe?

00:57:52,739 --> 00:57:54,007
I believe so.

00:57:54,074 --> 00:57:55,775
BRASS:
Well, the shoes link
Chloe to the nightclub

00:57:55,842 --> 00:57:57,410
and this job links Chloe
to the two vics.

00:57:57,477 --> 00:57:58,511
Where is she?

00:57:58,578 --> 00:57:59,846
She quit yesterday.

00:57:59,913 --> 00:58:01,248
I bet I know why.

00:58:01,314 --> 00:58:03,617
Well, if she's in town,
I'll find her.

00:58:09,456 --> 00:58:11,892
I owe you an apology.

00:58:11,958 --> 00:58:14,961
Apologies are just words.

00:58:23,737 --> 00:58:25,906
So you're calling it?

00:58:31,278 --> 00:58:33,680
I got two liars
and no murder weapon...

00:58:33,747 --> 00:58:35,682
and no choice.

00:58:35,749 --> 00:58:38,285
I'm going to nail the singer
on child endangerment,

00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:39,386
and fleeing the scene,

00:58:39,452 --> 00:58:41,655
and the dealer goes up
on possession for sale.

00:58:47,661 --> 00:58:50,864
What a great bedtime story
for my little girl.

00:58:50,931 --> 00:58:54,401
Cat, I did my best.

00:58:58,805 --> 00:59:01,841
No-needle syringe used
on the vic at the foam party.

00:59:01,908 --> 00:59:04,444
I recovered some epithelials
from the plunger end,

00:59:04,511 --> 00:59:07,414
compared them
to your reference sample.

00:59:11,718 --> 00:59:14,988
That girl you have in custody,
it's her DNA.

00:59:15,055 --> 00:59:17,958
Case closed.

00:59:18,024 --> 00:59:19,492
Thank you, Greg.

00:59:34,941 --> 00:59:36,176
Look familiar?

00:59:39,012 --> 00:59:42,916
Insulin was injected
into Trey Buchman's shoulder

00:59:42,983 --> 00:59:44,351
at this end...

00:59:44,417 --> 00:59:46,219
by you.

00:59:52,459 --> 00:59:56,296
Your epithelials were found
at the plunger end.

00:59:56,363 --> 01:00:00,600
Epithelials are skin cells
filled with DNA--

01:00:00,667 --> 01:00:04,804
your genetic fingerprint.

01:00:04,871 --> 01:00:06,573
BRASS:
So, you're going
to tell us why

01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,074
and you're going
to tell us why

01:00:08,141 --> 01:00:09,976
you strangled Rebecca McCormick.

01:00:10,043 --> 01:00:14,481
For Steven.

01:00:16,783 --> 01:00:18,652
I belong to him.

01:00:18,718 --> 01:00:22,289
McCORMICK:
<i>Chloe had a problem</i>

01:00:22,355 --> 01:00:24,524
controlling her emotions.

01:00:24,591 --> 01:00:26,693
She let things
get personal.

01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,662
Define "personal,"
in your crowd.

01:00:28,728 --> 01:00:29,696
In my "crowd"?

01:00:29,763 --> 01:00:30,764
Yeah.

01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:39,272
GRISSOM:
So you started
seeing each other

01:00:39,339 --> 01:00:41,975
outside of Lady Heather's?

01:00:42,042 --> 01:00:43,476
We'd meet
occasionally, yes.

01:00:43,543 --> 01:00:45,312
Listen...

01:00:45,378 --> 01:00:47,347
my wife had a problem with sex.

01:00:47,414 --> 01:00:48,315
Sounds like she had

01:00:48,381 --> 01:00:50,016
a problem with you, pal.

01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:52,752
My wife had a problem with sex.

01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:55,055
And at Lady Heather's,
I fixed her.

01:00:55,121 --> 01:00:56,056
Oh, you fixed her?

01:00:56,122 --> 01:00:58,058
Yes.

01:00:58,124 --> 01:00:59,025
She stay fixed?

01:00:59,092 --> 01:01:01,428
Yeah, you fixed her so good

01:01:01,494 --> 01:01:02,796
that she started
spending your money

01:01:02,862 --> 01:01:04,598
to get other men to give her
what you couldn't.

01:01:04,664 --> 01:01:05,599
Rebecca was
out of control.

01:01:05,665 --> 01:01:07,234
So you got her to kill
Richards and Buchman.

01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:08,602
No, I didn't.

01:01:08,668 --> 01:01:11,137
And then you told her
to kill your wife.
No, I loved my wife.

01:01:11,204 --> 01:01:12,672
I didn't tell Chloe
to do anything.

01:01:12,739 --> 01:01:16,610
What happened?
She killed Richards
and Buchman on her own.

01:01:16,676 --> 01:01:20,480
Okay.

01:01:24,217 --> 01:01:26,353
Chloe thought that
killing your wife's lovers

01:01:26,419 --> 01:01:27,621
would please you.

01:01:29,856 --> 01:01:31,358
And it did please you.

01:01:31,424 --> 01:01:33,126
I told her to stop.

01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:35,528
But she didn't obey you.

01:01:35,595 --> 01:01:37,063
She killed your wife.

01:01:39,065 --> 01:01:42,469
You couldn't make Chloe
do what you wanted.

01:01:42,535 --> 01:01:44,704
All that time at Lady Heather's

01:01:44,771 --> 01:01:46,640
and you never learned
that the submissive

01:01:46,706 --> 01:01:48,842
is the one in control?

01:01:51,845 --> 01:01:54,681
I told her to stop.

01:02:32,252 --> 01:02:39,526
