0	00:00:01	00:00:03	Lou Gedda's getting away with murder.
1	00:00:03	00:00:04	Warrick's a loose cannon.
2	00:00:04	00:00:08	He was in Gedda's strip club conducting his own police investigation.
3	00:00:08	00:00:09	What do you want? Everything.
4	00:00:09	00:00:11	No!
5	00:00:11	00:00:12	I did not kill her.
6	00:00:12	00:00:14	Grissom, you and I both know Gedda killed that girl.
7	00:00:14	00:00:15	Take the suspension or you're fired.
8	00:00:16	00:00:19	Guys like Lou Gedda don't skip on murder and extortion by being lucky.
9	00:00:19	00:00:21	I've got an update for you. Good work.
10	00:01:32	00:01:35	Oh...
11	00:01:49	00:01:52	Crime scene at a funeral?
12	00:01:52	00:01:54	Can't get much deader than this.
13	00:01:54	00:01:56	Liver temp certainly couldn't.
14	00:01:56	00:01:59	He's been dead more than 24 hours.
15	00:01:59	00:02:01	Any indication what he died from?
16	00:02:01	00:02:03	No. No sign of trauma.
17	00:02:03	00:02:05	I spoke with Mrs. Bell; she has no idea who the other D.B.
18	00:02:05	00:02:06	from the casket is. Okay.
19	00:02:06	00:02:09	Thanks.
20	00:02:09	00:02:11	That has got to be the biggest casket I've ever seen.
21	00:02:11	00:02:12	This is the Elvis model.
22	00:02:12	00:02:15	We're a fat country, Nick; here's our proof.
23	00:02:15	00:02:18	Yeah, I don't think they come out of the factory with room for two, though.
24	00:02:19	00:02:21	No, the extra compartment is a custom addition.
25	00:02:21	00:02:24	This board is what separated the two bodies.
26	00:02:24	00:02:26	The top guy was just too heavy.
27	00:02:30	00:02:32	Maybe it's a scam to save money.
28	00:02:32	00:02:36	Mortuaries are obligated to bury indigents at no charge.
29	00:02:36	00:02:39	Maybe save a burial plot by burying John Doe with John Smith.
30	00:02:40	00:02:42	Go ahead, man, put him in the van-- I dare you.
31	00:02:42	00:02:44	Guys, I'm just a coroner's assistant.
32	00:02:44	00:02:46	Coach Bell, he not going nowhere, man.
33	00:02:46	00:02:47	You got that right. Hold on.
34	00:02:47	00:02:49	Hold on, now, fellas, he's just doing his job.
35	00:02:49	00:02:50	Mr. Bell is our first priority.
36	00:02:50	00:02:52	We're gonna have him back here as soon as we can.
37	00:02:52	00:02:54	Okay, are you guys gonna help us with the funeral again, too?
38	00:02:54	00:02:56	And buy another casket?
39	00:02:56	00:02:57	'cause that was donated by the community.
40	00:02:57	00:02:59	We'll pay for a new casket.
41	00:02:59	00:03:00	We will?
42	00:03:00	00:03:02	Come on, man, this is a disgrace right now, man.
43	00:03:02	00:03:05	Hey, whoever put that other body in the casket is the one you should be angry with, not us.
44	00:03:06	00:03:07	If you let us do our job, we'll put him in jail.
45	00:03:07	00:03:08	This isn't right!
46	00:03:09	00:03:10	Guess you're gonna have to move us yourself then.
47	00:03:11	00:03:12	Yeah, man! Coach ain't going nowhere!
48	00:03:12	00:03:14	Hey, wait a second. Easy, guys!
49	00:03:14	00:03:16	Please, please, please, stop this!
50	00:03:16	00:03:18	Stop this now, please, just...
51	00:03:18	00:03:22	Let my husband through.
52	00:03:52	00:03:55	and TOYOTA. Moving Forward.
53	00:04:21	00:04:22	You're the mortician.
54	00:04:22	00:04:24	You're the one putting bodies into coffins.
55	00:04:24	00:04:27	So what, you have a two-for-one sale?
56	00:04:27	00:04:28	Who's the extra stiff?
57	00:04:28	00:04:31	You don't want to say anything? That's fine.
58	00:04:31	00:04:32	I'll just shut down the mortuary.
59	00:04:32	00:04:34	Maybe I'll book you on suspicion of murder.
60	00:04:34	00:04:38	For all I know, you killed the guy before you stuffed him in the coffin.
61	00:05:06	00:05:08	Got to admit it's a pretty clever way to dispose of a body.
62	00:05:08	00:05:10	Who's going to look under somebody else's tombstone?
63	00:05:10	00:05:12	Well, it's not exactly a new technique.
64	00:05:12	00:05:17	In the 1920s, Joe Bonanno used to dispose of his hits in a double-decker coffin.
65	00:05:17	00:05:20	So what is this, more research for your mob book?
66	00:05:20	00:05:22	I hope you're not starting to admire those thugs.
67	00:05:22	00:05:24	(scoffs) I don't admire them.
68	00:05:24	00:05:26	But I'm grateful.
69	00:05:26	00:05:28	For what?
70	00:05:28	00:05:30	Well, my, uh, book is done.
71	00:05:30	00:05:35	I have meetings with three different publishers in L.A., and I fly out the day after tomorrow.
72	00:05:42	00:05:44	I heard you were in here.
73	00:05:44	00:05:46	Need any help? Hmm?
74	00:05:46	00:05:48	Not really.
75	00:05:48	00:05:51	I've already collected trace off the body, and I'm almost done with the coffin here.
76	00:05:52	00:05:54	Chaparral High football coach, huh?
77	00:05:54	00:05:55	Mm-hmm.
78	00:05:55	00:05:57	Hey, by the way, how much do I owe you?
79	00:05:57	00:05:58	I don't know, Warrick.
80	00:05:58	00:06:00	Don't worry about it. Man, come on.
81	00:06:00	00:06:02	I always pay my debts.
82	00:06:02	00:06:03	This should cover it.
83	00:06:06	00:06:10	What exactly about the Chaparral High state champs reminded you to pay me?
84	00:06:10	00:06:11	Football always reminds me of money.
85	00:06:11	00:06:13	It's not football season.
86	00:06:13	00:06:14	It's baseball, but I don't bet baseball.
87	00:06:14	00:06:16	Pure paycheck, baby.
88	00:06:29	00:06:31	Hey, doc, you figure out what killed this guy yet?
89	00:06:31	00:06:36	Yeah, found some petechiae consistent with suffocation.
90	00:06:44	00:06:47	Yeah, this should do it.
91	00:06:49	00:06:51	You okay?
92	00:06:53	00:06:54	Yeah.
93	00:06:55	00:06:56	I know this guy.
94	00:06:56	00:06:58	Or I knew him.
95	00:06:58	00:07:00	He was a P.I.
96	00:07:00	00:07:01	You just saved yourself some work.
97	00:07:01	00:07:03	His prints will be in the system.
98	00:07:03	00:07:06	Thanks.
99	00:07:24	00:07:26	Lenny Harper.
100	00:07:26	00:07:29	We were in patrol together 20 some-odd years ago.
101	00:07:29	00:07:32	Class cop.
102	00:07:33	00:07:34	You sure we're talking about the same guy?
103	00:07:34	00:07:38	This guy's got a list of complaints going up right until about the day he retired...
104	00:07:38	00:07:40	at age 33.
105	00:07:40	00:07:42	Vegas was a different town back then.
106	00:07:42	00:07:44	You ruffled feathers, you got the boot.
107	00:07:44	00:07:49	But soliciting prostitutes, extorting businessmen, insurance fraud.
108	00:07:49	00:07:52	Kind of looks like he deserved to get the boot.
109	00:07:52	00:07:53	Lenny always said those complaints were trumped up.
110	00:07:54	00:07:57	This file doesn't change the way we treat this case.
111	00:07:57	00:07:59	Lenny was a cop.
112	00:07:59	00:08:00	Cops are a priority.
113	00:08:00	00:08:02	I want every man you got on this.
114	00:08:30	00:08:33	Either this guy is a neat freak or he's got one hell of a cleaning lady.
115	00:08:35	00:08:38	Left his computer; that helps.
116	00:08:44	00:08:45	Hey, Nick?
117	00:08:45	00:08:47	Is there a trash can under that desk?
118	00:08:49	00:08:50	Yeah.
119	00:08:50	00:08:51	Is there a liner in it?
120	00:08:51	00:08:52	Yeah. Why?
121	00:08:53	00:08:56	There's no liner in this one.
122	00:08:56	00:08:59	And the paper shredder's been emptied.
123	00:08:59	00:09:02	Looks like somebody cleaned up after they cleaned up.
124	00:09:39	00:09:42	This car is clean as a whistle.
125	00:09:42	00:09:45	The floor mat's still damp.
126	00:09:45	00:09:47	I think it's just been detailed.
127	00:09:47	00:09:52	What if the killer used the victim's car to transport the body?
128	00:09:53	00:10:05	He drives the victim's own vehicle back to the funeral home, stuffs the body in a double-decker coffin, hits a car wash, comes back, cleans out the office... and leaves us the keys?
129	00:10:05	00:10:07	It's pretty considerate.
130	00:10:07	00:10:09	Or very smart.
131	00:11:08	00:11:10	How did you get this number?
132	00:11:10	00:11:14	Is this some kind of a joke?
133	00:11:14	00:11:15	What the hell do you want?
134	00:11:15	00:11:18	Should I bring my own shovel?
135	00:11:44	00:11:45	Hey.
136	00:11:45	00:11:46	Hi.
137	00:11:46	00:11:49	Get anything off that computer?
138	00:11:49	00:11:51	No. Hard drive's been wiped clean.
139	00:11:51	00:11:53	What about the shredder?
140	00:11:53	00:11:59	Nothing but a couple of strips from a folder and a few receipts. But I got a court order on Mr. Harper's email accounts.
141	00:11:59	00:12:00	He had quite a few.
142	00:12:01	00:12:03	One that handled mostly family stuff.
143	00:12:03	00:12:04	One that handled new customers.
144	00:12:04	00:12:06	And a work account.
145	00:12:06	00:12:08	The work account had an online back-up system.
146	00:12:08	00:12:09	That's what I'm in now.
147	00:12:10	00:12:13	So you've basically gotten everything that was on his computer?
148	00:12:13	00:12:15	I even have stuff he erased.
149	00:12:15	00:12:18	There's a file in here that you might think is interesting.
150	00:12:18	00:12:21	P.I.'s like to use a lot of audio and visual surveillance.
151	00:12:21	00:12:23	Insurance policy.
152	00:12:23	00:12:26	This one was even taping his own meetings.
153	00:12:26	00:12:27	Really?
154	00:12:27	00:12:29	All right, so it's March 17, 2008.
155	00:12:29	00:12:32	Meeting with Client #333.
156	00:12:32	00:12:35	This was from inside his Escalade, yesterday...
157	00:12:35	00:12:38	She did it with a cop. I spit on her.
158	00:12:38	00:12:40	She deserved what she got.
159	00:12:40	00:12:43	That's as close to a confession as you're gonna get.
160	00:12:43	00:12:45	I'm gonna bury that guy, Lenny.
161	00:12:45	00:12:48	I'm gonna bury him.
162	00:12:48	00:12:51	Warrick couldn't investigate Gedda himself, so he had the P.I. do it for him.
163	00:12:51	00:12:55	Archie tracked down thousands of photos, sound byte files, videos.
164	00:12:55	00:12:57	Everything's connected to Lou Gedda.
165	00:12:57	00:13:02	I think Gedda caught Harper spying on him, killed him and had the mortician put the body in the double-decker casket.
166	00:13:04	00:13:06	This is Warrick Brown. Leave your name and number.
167	00:13:06	00:13:09	Warrick. Call me now!
168	00:13:11	00:13:15	Anybody hears from him, I want to know.
169	00:13:15	00:13:16	You got it.
170	00:13:30	00:13:32	Where the hell have you been?
171	00:13:32	00:13:34	Grissom... I gotta talk to you.
172	00:13:34	00:13:36	Something... something bad happened here.
173	00:13:36	00:13:38	Where are you?
174	00:13:38	00:13:39	Pigalle.
175	00:13:39	00:13:40	What are you thinking?
176	00:13:40	00:13:42	I don't know. I don't know.
177	00:13:42	00:13:44	You don't... you don't know what?
178	00:13:44	00:13:47	I don't know what I did here. I don't know what happened.
179	00:13:47	00:13:49	I just woke up and... I don't know...
180	00:13:50	00:13:51	I don't know what's going on here!
181	00:13:51	00:13:52	Drop the gun, show me your hands!
182	00:13:52	00:13:54	Warrick? Show me your hands!
183	00:13:54	00:13:56	I'm a CSI! Warrick?
184	00:13:56	00:13:58	I'm a CSI! I'm a CSI! Don't shoot! Get on your knees!
185	00:14:43	00:14:45	Warrick?
186	00:14:48	00:14:50	Grissom, I...
187	00:14:50	00:14:52	I don't know what happened.
188	00:14:52	00:14:55	Local merchant heard gunshots, called 9-1-1.
189	00:14:55	00:14:57	I responded code 3, with backup.
190	00:14:57	00:15:00	There was no one else in the building.
191	00:15:00	00:15:02	Thanks. Listen, uh...
192	00:15:02	00:15:04	could you give us just a minute?
193	00:15:09	00:15:11	What happened?
194	00:15:15	00:15:17	I don't know.
195	00:15:17	00:15:19	My head is throbbing.
196	00:15:21	00:15:23	Is that your gun?
197	00:15:23	00:15:25	Yeah.
198	00:15:25	00:15:27	Are those your cuffs?
199	00:15:28	00:15:31	I guess so.
200	00:15:33	00:15:35	We need to get you a lawyer.
201	00:15:37	00:15:39	Grissom...
202	00:15:39	00:15:42	Don't say another word.
203	00:15:42	00:15:44	Jim, listen to me. Just get on your feet.
204	00:15:44	00:15:45	I don't know what happened!
205	00:15:45	00:15:48	Look, hey, it's for your own good.
206	00:15:48	00:15:51	Keep your mouth shut till we get to the station.
207	00:15:54	00:15:56	You couldn't just let it go, huh?
208	00:15:56	00:15:58	Come on.
209	00:17:11	00:17:13	The 419 went out as officer involved. No details.
210	00:17:13	00:17:15	Yeah, we got here as quick as we could.
211	00:17:15	00:17:17	What the hell happened?
212	00:17:17	00:17:18	Gedda's dead.
213	00:17:25	00:17:28	Put your kits away.
214	00:17:28	00:17:30	Day Shift will be processing the scene.
215	00:17:30	00:17:33	I.A.'s taking the case from here.
216	00:17:50	00:17:52	Turn around.
217	00:17:56	00:17:59	You can put your hands d... No-- GSR. Sorry.
218	00:18:04	00:18:06	Get a lawyer.
219	00:18:06	00:18:09	I don't want one.
220	00:18:09	00:18:12	This isn't going away, Warrick. In 48 hours, they're gonna charge you.
221	00:18:13	00:18:15	I wouldn't know what to tell a lawyer, anyway.
222	00:18:15	00:18:18	I'm gonna have to take your clothes.
223	00:18:47	00:18:50	Were you just talking to I.A.?
224	00:18:50	00:18:52	Yes. And what'd you tell 'em?
225	00:18:52	00:18:55	I'm not supposed to talk about it; I signed an admonishment.
226	00:18:55	00:18:58	I don't care. What'd you say?
227	00:19:00	00:19:03	I said that I saw Warrick sitting alone in Grissom's office in the dark.
228	00:19:03	00:19:05	So what?
229	00:19:05	00:19:09	So, he got a phone call, and he got really pissed at the person he was talking to.
230	00:19:09	00:19:11	So what?
231	00:19:11	00:19:14	Then he was found an hour later in a pool of Gedda's blood.
232	00:19:14	00:19:17	You don't know what happened in there.
233	00:19:17	00:19:20	Look, Nick, all I did was tell the truth as I saw it.
234	00:19:20	00:19:23	That's what we're supposed to do. Right?
235	00:19:30	00:19:33	I don't remember what happened.
236	00:19:33	00:19:36	Is that what you're going with? Really?
237	00:19:36	00:19:38	That's what the truth is.
238	00:19:38	00:19:40	Okay.
239	00:19:40	00:19:49	Uh, for the record then, are you claiming memory loss from a possible concussion, or hysterical amnesia following a traumatic incident?
240	00:19:49	00:19:53	Like I told you, I just don't remember what happened.
241	00:19:53	00:19:56	You remember hiring Lenny Harper to investigate Lou Gedda...
242	00:19:56	00:20:00	in violation of direct orders?
243	00:20:00	00:20:01	Yeah.
244	00:20:03	00:20:04	You think Gedda was responsible?
245	00:20:04	00:20:05	I'd bet on it.
246	00:20:05	00:20:08	I've heard that about you.
247	00:20:08	00:20:10	Is that why you went to Pigalle?
248	00:20:10	00:20:13	I went to Pigalle because Lou Gedda called me.
249	00:20:15	00:20:18	Your coworkers corroborate a call, so we pulled your cell records.
250	00:20:18	00:20:22	It came from a disposable phone, which means it could've come from anybody.
251	00:20:22	00:20:24	No, it came from Lou Gedda.
252	00:20:24	00:20:25	I suppose that's possible.
253	00:20:25	00:20:28	But we do seem to be jogging your memory.
254	00:20:28	00:20:30	Let's keep that ball rolling. What happened next?
255	00:20:31	00:20:32	I went down there.
256	00:20:32	00:20:34	Alone?
257	00:20:34	00:20:36	Yes.
258	00:20:36	00:20:37	Unarmed?
259	00:20:38	00:20:40	No.
260	00:20:42	00:20:45	Gedda!
261	00:20:45	00:20:47	You called me!
262	00:20:47	00:20:49	Next thing I remember...
263	00:21:27	00:21:30	I don't remember anything that happened after that.
264	00:21:32	00:21:35	Uh, you left out the best part.
265	00:21:35	00:21:38	But I guess that's the...
266	00:21:38	00:21:40	amnesia.
267	00:21:40	00:21:42	You want me to fill in the blank?
268	00:21:42	00:21:44	Your gun...
269	00:21:44	00:21:46	with blood, tissue and hair at the scene.
270	00:21:46	00:21:48	Your handcuffs on the vic.
271	00:21:48	00:21:51	You...
272	00:21:51	00:21:52	covered in blood.
273	00:21:52	00:21:59	You went to Pigalle to get revenge by giving Lou Gedda a taste of his own medicine.
274	00:22:14	00:22:16	You're a CSI.
275	00:22:16	00:22:18	What's the evidence telling you?
276	00:22:26	00:22:28	The evidence is...
277	00:22:30	00:22:33	...the evidence is suggesting that I did it.
278	00:22:35	00:22:36	Okay.
279	00:22:37	00:22:40	You think this is some kind of a joke, eh?
280	00:22:40	00:22:41	You think this is a joke, right? You're making a mistake.
281	00:22:41	00:22:43	I don't know what happened. You're digging a hole.
282	00:22:43	00:22:45	You understand what I'm saying?!
283	00:22:45	00:22:46	I don't know what happened!
284	00:22:46	00:22:48	I know that.
285	00:23:01	00:23:05	Okay, the rods are in place according to the autopsy report.
286	00:23:05	00:23:06	Conrad.
287	00:23:07	00:23:10	Gil, we're processing Warrick's case evidence.
288	00:23:10	00:23:12	You shouldn't even be in here.
289	00:23:12	00:23:13	I'd like to see the files.
290	00:23:13	00:23:15	Well, they're not done yet.
291	00:23:15	00:23:17	We're still finalizing our conclusions.
292	00:23:17	00:23:21	Yeah, but if I could see the raw test data, I could draw my own conclusions.
293	00:23:21	00:23:24	I'll get you copies of the reports.
294	00:23:24	00:23:25	You'll have them in a couple of hours.
295	00:23:25	00:23:27	Thanks.
296	00:23:38	00:23:39	Excuse me, Detective.
297	00:23:40	00:23:43	May I have a few minutes with CSI Brown?
298	00:23:43	00:23:44	Why?
299	00:23:44	00:23:45	I'm a friend.
300	00:23:46	00:23:47	Well, he sure needs one of those.
301	00:23:47	00:23:49	Be my guest. Thank you.
302	00:23:57	00:23:59	How you holding up?
303	00:23:59	00:24:01	Hmm.
304	00:24:01	00:24:04	That depends.
305	00:24:07	00:24:09	Do you think I did it?
306	00:24:09	00:24:13	I can't discuss the case.
307	00:24:13	00:24:15	Yeah.
308	00:24:17	00:24:21	I don't know, I think I'd just feel a lot better if I had a change of clothes.
309	00:24:21	00:24:22	I hate being dressed like a convict.
310	00:24:23	00:24:25	I'll take care of it.
311	00:24:26	00:24:27	Stay strong.
312	00:24:38	00:24:39	We're not through yet.
313	00:24:39	00:24:42	Okay, um...
314	00:24:42	00:24:44	Let's... let's back up a little bit.
315	00:24:45	00:24:47	You get involved with a pretty young thing.
316	00:24:47	00:24:49	You go away to do your business.
317	00:24:49	00:24:51	She winds up dead.
318	00:24:51	00:24:54	You ever think about that?
319	00:24:54	00:24:56	I think about Joanna every day.
320	00:24:56	00:24:59	There's not a day that goes by I don't think about her.
321	00:24:59	00:25:00	No, I'm sorry.
322	00:25:00	00:25:02	I was talking about Holly Gribbs.
323	00:25:02	00:25:07	You remember Holly, don't you?
324	00:25:07	00:25:12	Rookie CSI you left alone at a crime scene eight years ago to go place bets for a crooked judge.
325	00:25:12	00:25:14	Suspect came back and shot her.
326	00:25:14	00:25:15	I remember.
327	00:25:15	00:25:19	Poor innocent girl just trying to do her job.
328	00:25:19	00:25:21	She winds up dead because of you.
329	00:25:21	00:25:23	That has nothing to do with this.
330	00:25:23	00:25:24	Do two points make a straight line?
331	00:25:24	00:25:25	It's a pattern of behavior.
332	00:25:26	00:25:32	Reckless, obsessive, compulsive, self-destructive behavior.
333	00:25:50	00:25:53	What are you doing here?
334	00:25:53	00:25:58	I just stopped by to get Warrick a change of clothes.
335	00:25:58	00:26:03	All right, take something out of the drawers-- nothing laid out or in the laundry.
336	00:26:03	00:26:07	You get Holly killed, then you get Joanna killed.
337	00:26:07	00:26:09	You just can't take any more, so you kill Gedda.
338	00:26:09	00:26:11	That's how a jury's going to see it.
339	00:26:11	00:26:13	There's nothing I can do about that.
340	00:26:13	00:26:15	Sure there is.
341	00:26:15	00:26:18	Look, Lou Gedda was a slimeball.
342	00:26:18	00:26:20	That's common knowledge.
343	00:26:20	00:26:22	Nobody's going to miss him.
344	00:26:22	00:26:25	In fact, the world is arguably a better place without him.
345	00:26:25	00:26:30	And so if I just admit to killing him, they'll take it easy on me, and you're just trying to help me out, right?
346	00:26:30	00:26:33	You know how many times I used that on a suspect?
347	00:26:33	00:26:35	Don't waste your game, pal.
348	00:26:35	00:26:36	Okay.
349	00:26:36	00:26:37	You're a betting man.
350	00:26:37	00:26:41	Given the circumstances, what do you think your odds are right now?
351	00:26:43	00:26:46	I want a lawyer.
352	00:26:50	00:26:55	There were numerous high-velocity blood stains on the front of CSI Warrick Brown's shirt.
353	00:26:55	00:27:01	Seven of these stains were typed using 13 STR loci.
354	00:27:01	00:27:05	All samples match blood collected from Lou Gedda at autopsy...
355	00:27:05	00:27:12	The five expended cartridge cases recovered at Pigalle Boulevard were all fired in Warrick Brown's service pistol...
356	00:27:17	00:27:23	The bullets recovered at autopsy and from the barber's chair were fired from the same firearm, as well...
357	00:27:24	00:27:30	Based on the clotting of the facial lacerations and development of the bruises on the victim's arms and wrists...
358	00:27:31	00:27:34	it appears he was bound and beaten at least an hour prior to death...
359	00:27:36	00:27:41	Okay, if this were any other suspect, what would be our conclusion?
360	00:27:47	00:27:49	That he did it.
361	00:27:49	00:27:51	Which is what Warrick told Internal Affairs.
362	00:27:51	00:27:52	He confessed?
363	00:27:52	00:27:54	No, but he didn't deny it.
364	00:27:54	00:27:57	He says he can't remember.
365	00:27:57	00:27:58	We've all heard that one before.
366	00:27:59	00:28:01	What's that supposed to mean?
367	00:28:01	00:28:02	It's not supposed to mean anything.
368	00:28:02	00:28:04	We're just talking.
369	00:28:04	00:28:06	We can't just sit her and watch him go down.
370	00:28:06	00:28:09	We're not going to.
371	00:28:09	00:28:10	He's asked for an attorney.
372	00:28:10	00:28:12	We'll get him a shark.
373	00:28:12	00:28:16	The only thing the jury's going to see is a rogue cop with a vendetta.
374	00:28:16	00:28:18	I've been there before.
375	00:28:18	00:28:20	They're going to crucify him.
376	00:28:20	00:28:23	Hey, guys, I'm sorry to interrupt, but you need to see this.
377	00:28:23	00:28:26	There was chloroform in Lou Gedda's blood and tissue.
378	00:28:26	00:28:30	Chloroform gets metabolized in the body pretty quickly, and it's excreted by breathing.
379	00:28:30	00:28:32	Gedda must have been killed soon after he was dosed.
380	00:28:32	00:28:37	Warrick went in there with a gun.
381	00:28:37	00:28:40	Why would he use chloroform if he was going to shoot him?
382	00:28:40	00:28:42	Maybe to subdue him into the barber's chair.
383	00:28:42	00:28:43	So he intended to torture him?
384	00:28:45	00:28:47	No, not Warrick. No way.
385	00:28:47	00:28:52	You know, chloroform exposure can result in short term amnesia.
386	00:28:52	00:28:56	Warrick says he can't remember anything after going into Gedda's office.
387	00:28:56	00:28:59	Where's the tox on Warrick?
388	00:28:59	00:29:00	His blood wasn't drawn.
389	00:29:00	00:29:01	Why not?
390	00:29:01	00:29:04	The arrest report didn't note any intoxication at the scene.
391	00:29:04	00:29:06	I guess nobody saw any reason to do it.
392	00:29:06	00:29:07	Well, now there's a reason.
393	00:29:15	00:29:17	Here, put this on.
394	00:29:17	00:29:19	Okay.
395	00:29:19	00:29:26	Henry did a comprehensive drug test for chloroform, along with a head space run for volatiles and solvents.
396	00:29:26	00:29:28	Everything came back negative.
397	00:29:28	00:29:31	Half-life of chloroform in a human being is about 1.5 hours.
398	00:29:31	00:29:35	It's virtually undetectable in seven to ten hours.
399	00:29:35	00:29:37	We drew the blood too late.
400	00:29:37	00:29:39	It's still possible Warrick was dosed.
401	00:29:39	00:29:40	We just can't prove it.
402	00:29:41	00:29:42	Nick, come here.
403	00:29:42	00:29:43	Take a look at his shirt.
404	00:29:46	00:29:49	See the voids in the blood spatter around the armpits.
405	00:29:49	00:29:53	Fabric must have been folded when the blood was deposited.
406	00:29:53	00:29:55	Looks like he had something under his arms.
407	00:29:55	00:29:56	Mm-hmm.
408	00:29:56	00:30:00	Grab Hodges from behind-- under the armpits.
409	00:30:00	00:30:02	Turn around.
410	00:30:02	00:30:03	Dead weight, Hodges. Slump down.
411	00:30:03	00:30:05	Let him hold you up.
412	00:30:05	00:30:06	Okay, Nick...
413	00:30:06	00:30:07	Raise his right arm.
414	00:30:07	00:30:10	Pretend he's got a gun in his hand.
415	00:30:13	00:30:15	It's possible.
416	00:30:15	00:30:20	I mean, if Warrick were unconscious or semiconscious, he would have had to have been supported.
417	00:30:20	00:30:28	Well, based on the high-velocity spatter on the shirt, the shooter would have had to be within three feet of Gedda when he fired.
418	00:30:34	00:30:36	Take off the shirt.
419	00:30:39	00:30:41	Thanks.
420	00:30:47	00:30:48	Similar void in the spatter pattern.
421	00:30:53	00:30:55	It's consistent, but not conclusive.
422	00:30:55	00:30:59	There's probably a dozen different ways to explain those voids.
423	00:30:59	00:31:01	Doesn't rule Warrick out as the shooter.
424	00:31:01	00:31:04	But it gives an alternative explanation of the evidence.
425	00:31:04	00:31:06	And if we're right...
426	00:31:06	00:31:08	Warrick was framed.
427	00:31:13	00:31:16	I talked to a detective at organized crime.
428	00:31:16	00:31:19	He's sending over a list of all the people that wanted Gedda dead.
429	00:31:19	00:31:21	It's a long list.
430	00:31:21	00:31:25	Cross-reference it to any of Warrick's convictions who might have it out for him.
431	00:31:25	00:31:27	Maybe somebody's trying to kill two birds with one stone.
432	00:31:27	00:31:28	Okay, I'm on it.
433	00:31:28	00:31:29	Hey.
434	00:31:29	00:31:31	Any unknown contributors from the blood at the scene?
435	00:31:31	00:31:33	No. They're all coming back to the vic.
436	00:31:33	00:31:36	Wendy and I are working as fast as we can.
437	00:31:46	00:31:48	We're striking out.
438	00:31:48	00:31:52	There's no new evidence from the scene that points to any additional suspects.
439	00:31:52	00:31:54	You got something?
440	00:31:57	00:31:58	Handcuffs?
441	00:31:58	00:32:00	Take a look at the ligature marks.
442	00:32:00	00:32:10	The width of the rails on Warrick's cuffs are three millimeters narrower than the ligature marks.
443	00:32:10	00:32:13	The ligature marks on Gedda didn't come from Warrick's cuffs.
444	00:32:15	00:32:19	So somebody switched the handcuffs after Gedda was dead?
445	00:32:19	00:32:24	Brass always suspected that there was a mole in the department that worked for Gedda.
446	00:32:24	00:32:27	I bet we're looking for a cop.
447	00:32:27	00:32:31	A P.I. investigating Gedda gets killed...
448	00:32:31	00:32:33	then Gedda gets killed...
449	00:32:33	00:32:37	Maybe this dirty cop did them both.
450	00:32:37	00:32:41	Yeah, but we can't prove it, 'cause we're not allowed to investigate Gedda's murder.
451	00:32:41	00:32:43	We're still investigating the P.I.
452	00:32:43	00:32:48	If the cases are linked, we solve one, we solve the other.
453	00:32:51	00:32:54	Do your client and this department a favor-- make a deal.
454	00:32:54	00:32:59	The district attorney said he might consider manslaughter.
455	00:32:59	00:33:01	I can't do that.
456	00:33:01	00:33:03	Are you telling me you're innocent?
457	00:33:03	00:33:07	Because I.A. said those words never crossed your lips.
458	00:33:07	00:33:09	Are you charging me?
459	00:33:09	00:33:11	Not yet.
460	00:33:11	00:33:14	But in about five hours, it's gonna be first-degree murder.
461	00:33:17	00:33:18	We got the link.
462	00:33:18	00:33:22	Tox confirmed traces of chloroform in the P.I.'s body.
463	00:33:22	00:33:24	Had to have been the same guy who killed Gedda.
464	00:33:24	00:33:26	Well, that helps.
465	00:33:27	00:33:38	Okay. We got evidence logs and police files from both scenes, but if a cop left trace at either murder scene, we'd just write it off to normal investigator contamination.
466	00:33:38	00:33:39	Yeah.
467	00:33:39	00:33:45	After he killed his victims, he could've even stayed and handled the scene, made sure that he hadn't missed anything.
468	00:33:47	00:33:52	Day Shift found prints from three officers at Gedda's office.
469	00:33:52	00:33:54	Well, all three were assigned to the scene.
470	00:33:54	00:34:00	Mandy I.D.'d fingerprints from five officers at the mortuary.
471	00:34:01	00:34:05	Okay, but only four signed the log.
472	00:34:05	00:34:07	The unexplained print...
473	00:34:07	00:34:11	belongs to...
474	00:34:11	00:34:13	Officer Daniel Pritchard.
475	00:34:18	00:34:21	His fingerprint was found... on the casket.
476	00:34:21	00:34:26	How does his fingerprint get on the casket if he wasn't at the mortuary?
477	00:34:27	00:34:28	I'm sorry, Captain.
478	00:34:28	00:34:30	No one's seen Pritchard since day before yesterday.
479	00:34:30	00:34:32	Open it.
480	00:34:44	00:34:47	No cuffs.
481	00:34:50	00:34:52	Maybe we don't need them.
482	00:35:24	00:35:26	So it's all on Pritchard.
483	00:35:31	00:35:33	Is this gonna hold up in court?
484	00:35:33	00:35:37	It will. You know what the defense is gonna say, right?
485	00:35:37	00:35:40	who better than a CSI to make a murder look like a frame?
486	00:35:40	00:35:42	He was framed.
487	00:35:42	00:35:45	And I'll prove it.
488	00:35:54	00:35:57	Listen, Grissom, um...
489	00:35:57	00:36:00	I'm so sorry about all this.
490	00:36:00	00:36:03	Warrick.
491	00:36:03	00:36:04	Yeah.
492	00:36:04	00:36:06	You were framed.
493	00:36:07	00:36:09	Framed?
494	00:36:14	00:36:17	By who?
495	00:36:17	00:36:19	Gedda has a mole in the department.
496	00:36:20	00:36:23	I'm ready to talk.
497	00:36:24	00:36:26	He's on the way.
498	00:36:29	00:36:31	Gedda!
499	00:36:31	00:36:33	You called me?
500	00:36:44	00:36:45	A cop?
501	00:36:45	00:36:47	Daniel Pritchard.
502	00:36:47	00:36:53	We think that he had him kill Lenny Harper, Probably Joanna Krumsky, as well.
503	00:36:53	00:36:55	Then why would he kill Gedda?
504	00:36:56	00:36:57	Who knows?
505	00:36:57	00:36:59	Old mobsters... crooked cops.
506	00:36:59	00:37:01	It's a long history.
507	00:37:01	00:37:03	I don't know. I mean...
508	00:37:03	00:37:04	Come on, Grissom.
509	00:37:04	00:37:10	Gedda's been killing and barbecuing people for 25 years.
510	00:37:10	00:37:14	It'd take more than a beat cop to get over on that fat bastard.
511	00:37:14	00:37:16	There's got to be somebody higher up than that.
512	00:37:16	00:37:18	Probably.
513	00:37:18	00:37:20	But Pritchard's all we got for now.
514	00:37:20	00:37:22	He's in custody?
515	00:37:22	00:37:23	Not yet.
516	00:37:23	00:37:25	Hey, everything can't go our way.
517	00:37:27	00:37:30	The D.A.'s gonna drop the charges.
518	00:37:32	00:37:36	But there's still the question of administrative violations.
519	00:37:36	00:37:43	So Ecklie and I are recommending to the undersheriff that you be suspended and demoted but not terminated.
520	00:37:43	00:37:45	I still have a job?
521	00:37:45	00:37:47	Well...
522	00:37:47	00:37:52	the undersheriff says he has to think about it, but he just wants to make you sweat.
523	00:37:52	00:37:55	I've sweated enough, man.
524	00:37:55	00:37:57	I imagine.
525	00:38:04	00:38:06	Thank you.
526	00:38:09	00:38:10	Thanks.
527	00:38:10	00:38:12	Thank you.
528	00:38:14	00:38:16	Come on.
529	00:38:16	00:38:18	Brass is gonna process you out.
530	00:38:33	00:38:36	Don't ever forget how lucky you are.
531	00:38:38	00:38:40	Let's go.
532	00:38:52	00:38:55	But at least mine was with Lana Turner, not Aaron Spelling.
533	00:38:58	00:39:00	That's pretty lame, I know.
534	00:39:00	00:39:06	This just reminds me, what does it take to get them to serve turkey bacon in this place?
535	00:39:06	00:39:09	Turkey bacon's not gonna make the food any better here.
536	00:39:09	00:39:11	Yeah, well, fortunately we don't come here for the food.
537	00:39:12	00:39:13	No.
538	00:39:13	00:39:17	Well, as far as I'm concerned, there's no place I'd rather be.
539	00:39:17	00:39:18	Aw...
540	00:39:18	00:39:21	Aw...
541	00:39:26	00:39:27	Anything else?
542	00:39:27	00:39:29	See you next time? Yeah.
543	00:39:29	00:39:31	Thanks.
544	00:39:33	00:39:34	You still there?
545	00:39:34	00:39:35	Hmm?
546	00:39:35	00:39:37	This one right here.
547	00:39:37	00:39:38	I'll take this.
548	00:39:38	00:39:40	Well, thank you, Warrick.
549	00:39:44	00:39:47	Thank you.
550	00:39:47	00:39:48	Okay.
551	00:39:48	00:39:50	I'm going home.
552	00:39:50	00:39:51	Yeah, me, too.
553	00:39:51	00:39:52	Get some sleep tonight.
554	00:39:52	00:39:53	Oh, yeah.
555	00:39:54	00:39:55	Thanks for breakfast.
556	00:39:55	00:39:57	You got it, man.
557	00:39:57	00:39:58	See you at the lab.
558	00:40:03	00:40:08	If you ever need anybody to talk to, you know how to get a hold of me, huh? Yeah.
559	00:40:08	00:40:10	Thanks.
560	00:40:21	00:40:24	Well...
561	00:40:24	00:40:25	it's just you and me, Serpico.
562	00:40:26	00:40:27	Let's get a beer.
563	00:40:27	00:40:29	Oh, no.
564	00:40:29	00:40:30	Come on. You're a free man now.
565	00:40:30	00:40:32	This free man needs a free shower.
566	00:40:32	00:40:33	I think, uh...
567	00:40:33	00:40:37	you need to, uh... take a hard look at that redhead.
568	00:40:37	00:40:38	You know, I might just do that.
569	00:40:38	00:40:41	Yeah. You need to.
570	00:40:41	00:40:43	Hey.
571	00:40:43	00:40:45	I'm really glad you're okay.
572	00:40:48	00:40:50	I'll call you later.
573	00:40:50	00:40:53	All right.
574	00:41:38	00:41:39	Warrick.
575	00:41:39	00:41:41	Hey. I wanted to join you for dinner.
576	00:41:41	00:41:43	I'm sorry we missed you.
577	00:41:43	00:41:44	Yeah, well.
578	00:41:45	00:41:47	I just wanted to congratulate you in person.
579	00:41:47	00:41:49	You sure made a believer out of me.
580	00:41:49	00:41:51	Thanks.
581	00:41:52	00:41:56	Look, uh... I don't want to fire you.
582	00:41:56	00:42:00	I just need to know that you're through running the streets on your own looking for bad guys.
583	00:42:00	00:42:02	Look...
584	00:42:02	00:42:07	I'm done being a rogue in the streets, you know?
585	00:42:07	00:42:11	But there's... there's one son of a bitch still out there.
586	00:42:11	00:42:14	And I promise you, we're gonna get him.
587	00:42:14	00:42:17	Well... Grissom taught you well.
588	00:42:17	00:42:20	I like to think so.
589	00:42:20	00:42:21	You never give up.
590	00:42:21	00:42:23	No.
591	00:42:26	00:42:28	That's what makes you a great CSI.
