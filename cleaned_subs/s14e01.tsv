0	00:00:01	00:00:05	Previously on CSI Our serial killer got all of his inspiration the Nine Circles of Hell.
1	00:00:05	00:00:08	Your daughter, Ellie, is one of the girls who may be missing.
2	00:00:08	00:00:09	The pictures I sent online?
3	00:00:09	00:00:11	A client who reached out to my ministry.
4	00:00:11	00:00:14	Oliver Tate. Works for a biotech company.
5	00:00:14	00:00:19	Without an undercover operation, we are all just sitting around waiting for another body to drop.
6	00:00:19	00:00:20	I need to do this, Dad.
7	00:00:20	00:00:21	Stop the SUV.
8	00:00:21	00:00:23	Killer's got Morgan. And Ellie.
9	00:00:23	00:00:24	He's got them both.
10	00:00:27	00:00:36	The Book of Job tells the story of a man who loved God and renounced evil.
11	00:00:36	00:00:40	Until one day, Satan posed a challenge to God.
12	00:00:41	00:00:43	Test this man.
13	00:00:43	00:00:46	Test his faith.
14	00:00:46	00:00:52	When we mourn, we're all tempted to curse God.
15	00:00:52	00:00:56	To give voice to our anger, our confusion.
16	00:00:56	00:00:59	Our sense of powerlessness against evil.
17	00:01:02	00:01:07	Are we being punished for our own sins?
18	00:01:10	00:01:13	Is there something we could have done?
19	00:01:13	00:01:16	You are the angry girl.
20	00:01:24	00:01:26	Get out of the car! Now! Get out!
21	00:01:28	00:01:31	Nick! She's not here. Russell, Morgan's gone.
22	00:01:32	00:01:36	Oliver Tate, LVPD!
23	00:01:36	00:01:37	Go, go!
24	00:01:37	00:01:39	Go left!
25	00:01:39	00:01:40	Yep. Clear. Clear!
26	00:01:40	00:01:41	Sheriff, it's clear.
27	00:01:41	00:01:44	No sign of... Find Tate.
28	00:01:44	00:01:46	Nick, traffic cams showed two SUVs.
29	00:01:46	00:01:47	We're tracking the other one now.
30	00:01:49	00:01:50	I got it.
31	00:01:50	00:01:56	The SUV with Morgan is parked outside a storage facility off of Hill and Decatur.
32	00:02:17	00:02:19	Greg.
33	00:02:19	00:02:20	Greg!
34	00:02:20	00:02:23	Drop back!
35	00:02:32	00:02:34	Greg?
36	00:02:51	00:02:53	Nick, Greg, talk to me. What's going on?
37	00:03:35	00:03:37	Stand by, Russell.
38	00:03:52	00:03:54	It's not Morgan. It sure looks like her, though.
39	00:03:54	00:03:56	Her hair, her dress.
40	00:03:56	00:03:59	I think it's one of the missing girls from Larson's church.
41	00:03:59	00:04:04	The crime scene's staged like the Fifth Circle of Hell.
42	00:04:04	00:04:08	We'll start to process. Uh, get us some help out here, will you?
43	00:04:08	00:04:09	If I may conjecture...
44	00:04:09	00:04:10	John, not now.
45	00:04:10	00:04:12	Your press badge only gets you so much access. No, I understand.
46	00:04:12	00:04:16	This has nothing to do with my being a reporter doing some story right now.
47	00:04:16	00:04:22	If neither Ellie Brass nor CSI Brody were intended to be the killer's next victim, then...
48	00:04:22	00:04:24	then there is still hope, isn't there?
49	00:04:24	00:04:30	There are four circles of Hell left, so... more circles means more time.
50	00:04:30	00:04:31	We are gonna find them.
51	00:04:31	00:04:33	Alive?
52	00:04:33	00:04:35	Or like all the others?
53	00:04:35	00:04:37	We know you're working with Oliver Tate.
54	00:04:37	00:04:39	Oliver Tate. (chuckles)
55	00:04:39	00:04:40	No way.
56	00:04:40	00:04:42	Where are the girls?
57	00:04:42	00:04:44	I already told your guys who stopped me.
58	00:04:44	00:04:46	Now I'm telling you-- I don't know.
59	00:04:46	00:04:48	And we're telling you we don't buy it.
60	00:04:48	00:04:52	Two SUVs, two drivers-- you playing decoy, and whoever was driving the girl.
61	00:04:52	00:04:53	And not just any girl.
62	00:04:53	00:04:56	I know your daughter Ellie from Brother Larson's church.
63	00:04:56	00:04:59	She told me all about you.
64	00:04:59	00:05:00	I'm not your little girl.
65	00:05:02	00:05:04	You're gonna talk to us.
66	00:05:04	00:05:05	Kiss my ass.
67	00:05:05	00:05:07	All right, all right, no, no, no, no.
68	00:05:07	00:05:11	The kid knows where Morgan is, Jim.
69	00:05:11	00:05:14	You want to know why I was driving that SUV?
70	00:05:14	00:05:16	I work for Brother Larson.
71	00:05:16	00:05:18	Talk to him.
72	00:05:18	00:05:20	You set us up, you son of a bitch.
73	00:05:20	00:05:22	I don't know what kind of...
74	00:05:22	00:05:27	intimidation Jake was subjected to, but I know the boy's flesh is weak.
75	00:05:27	00:05:33	Righteousness and a good lawyer, cast out that confession faster than Jesus cast out the moneychangers from the temple.
76	00:05:33	00:05:35	I--I don't way what game you're...
77	00:05:35	00:05:36	you think you're playing here.
78	00:05:36	00:05:41	You--you and Tate are on the hook for four murders, and now two kidnappings.
79	00:05:41	00:05:43	I'm being set up, pal.
80	00:05:43	00:05:45	I'm telling you, Oliver Tate is setting me up.
81	00:05:45	00:05:47	Why would Tate go after you?
82	00:05:47	00:05:49	Obviously, a man of Tate's...
83	00:05:49	00:05:52	dark desires is vulnerable.
84	00:05:52	00:05:55	I tried to blackmail him, but...
85	00:05:55	00:05:57	man wouldn't pay my price, so...
86	00:05:57	00:05:59	I called his bluff.
87	00:05:59	00:06:02	I shared his secrets with his...
88	00:06:02	00:06:04	friends, his employer.
89	00:06:05	00:06:08	Much to his chagrin, I imagine.
90	00:06:08	00:06:10	You don't believe me, do you?
91	00:06:10	00:06:13	No. Admittedly, I've not earned your faith.
92	00:06:13	00:06:17	But... I know someone who has.
93	00:06:17	00:06:21	Someone who was once Tate's favorite forbidden fruit.
94	00:06:21	00:06:24	Someone who once saved your life.
95	00:06:24	00:06:25	Angela?
96	00:06:25	00:06:26	The very same.
97	00:06:26	00:06:34	I should warn you, Mr. Russell, if Oliver Tate is the master of this game, he will never stop until he sees to it...
98	00:06:34	00:06:36	we all burn.
99	00:06:38	00:06:39	Can you hear me?
100	00:06:39	00:06:41	Are you okay?
101	00:06:41	00:06:43	Can you hear me?
102	00:06:43	00:06:46	Are you okay?
103	00:06:46	00:06:48	Can you hear me?
104	00:06:50	00:06:52	Ellie?
105	00:06:52	00:06:54	You're the cop. He said you'd be coming.
106	00:06:59	00:07:00	Who? Who said that?
107	00:07:00	00:07:03	I don't know. I haven't seen his face.
108	00:07:03	00:07:05	All I know is that I was with him at his condo, and then I woke up here.
109	00:07:05	00:07:07	You were with him, too?
110	00:07:07	00:07:09	Yeah.
111	00:07:11	00:07:12	Where are we?
112	00:07:12	00:07:14	What is this place?
113	00:07:14	00:07:16	It's hell.
114	00:07:25	00:07:27	Hyoid bone's broken.
115	00:07:27	00:07:29	Denise Tyler was strangled.
116	00:07:31	00:07:37	Thoracic injuries appear postmortem from being impaled on that spear. Staged.
117	00:07:37	00:07:38	Just like the others.
118	00:07:38	00:07:40	We've seen this latent bruising before.
119	00:07:40	00:07:42	Our last victim.
120	00:07:44	00:07:45	Barb...
121	00:07:45	00:07:47	the...
122	00:07:47	00:07:48	thorns.
123	00:07:48	00:07:50	What does that mean?
124	00:07:50	00:07:52	I don't know.
125	00:07:52	00:07:59	This guy's dropping bodies, he's staging crime scenes and leaving nothing behind to tie him to the murders.
126	00:07:59	00:08:02	Maybe this time he did. This looks like a dried secretion.
127	00:08:04	00:08:07	Perhaps a bead of sweat from the attack.
128	00:08:07	00:08:10	Could be our killer's DNA.
129	00:08:14	00:08:17	Who's the mannequin supposed to be, the Grim Reaper or something?
130	00:08:17	00:08:19	Phlegyas, the boatman.
131	00:08:19	00:08:28	In Dante's Inferno, Virgil escorts Dante down through the Nine Circles of Hell, and Phlegyas here is the one who gets him across the River Styx, the River of Death.
132	00:08:29	00:08:31	I always liked engineering.
133	00:08:31	00:08:34	How wide do you think that door is?
134	00:08:34	00:08:35	I don't know, maybe four feet.
135	00:08:35	00:08:37	And the beam of this boat?
136	00:08:37	00:08:39	At least six.
137	00:08:39	00:08:41	Somebody put this thing together in here.
138	00:08:41	00:08:44	Let's see if we can take it apart real quick.
139	00:08:44	00:08:46	I think there's a seam right here.
140	00:08:48	00:08:50	Ready? Yeah.
141	00:08:56	00:09:01	Balliol's bones-- just like the ones our guy's been leaving behind for us in the Bibles.
142	00:09:01	00:09:11	Yeah, but those dowels had zeros on them; these have zeros and numbers in repeating order from stem to stern.
143	00:09:11	00:09:14	Maybe it's some kind of, uh, sequence, like a code.
144	00:09:18	00:09:20	Tate's leaving us messages.
145	00:09:20	00:09:22	He must've left us something somewhere in that condo.
146	00:09:22	00:09:24	I mean, he know we were gonna tear the place apart.
147	00:09:24	00:09:28	I'm telling you, I haven't found anything, and I mean anything.
148	00:09:28	00:09:31	There is no blood, there are no signs of violence.
149	00:09:31	00:09:34	There is nothing here to even suggest a secondary location.
150	00:09:34	00:09:35	All right. Keep looking.
151	00:09:35	00:09:38	You know, there's got to be a message there someplace.
152	00:09:38	00:09:40	Hi. Hi.
153	00:09:40	00:09:42	Did you find any trace from the crime scene?
154	00:09:42	00:09:44	Boat, SUV, dowel?
155	00:09:44	00:09:47	I did find trace on the spear and the planks of the dory.
156	00:09:47	00:09:48	Halide deposits.
157	00:09:48	00:09:50	That's rock salt, right?
158	00:09:50	00:09:55	We're 300 miles from the nearest ocean, but there are any number of mineral deposits in southern Nevada.
159	00:09:55	00:09:57	Doesn't exactly narrow it down, does it? No, it doesn't.
160	00:09:57	00:10:00	She's a CSI.
161	00:10:00	00:10:02	What the hell was she doing undercover?
162	00:10:02	00:10:04	Call me if you find anything, David.
163	00:10:04	00:10:09	Doc said he may have found some DNA from the killer on Denise Tyler's body.
164	00:10:09	00:10:11	Is that right? Yeah, I've got a dried secretion.
165	00:10:11	00:10:13	I ran it--there seems to be a problem.
166	00:10:13	00:10:16	The profile seems incomplete; there's no amelogenin.
167	00:10:16	00:10:18	No sex gene?
168	00:10:18	00:10:20	How is that even possible?
169	00:10:20	00:10:22	You know, run it again, and get Greg to help you.
170	00:10:35	00:10:37	Hey. Hey.
171	00:10:37	00:10:39	When did you get back from San Francisco?
172	00:10:39	00:10:41	A few hours ago. You were in PD.
173	00:10:41	00:10:43	Uh, Ecklie asked me to check on Larson's story.
174	00:10:43	00:10:50	According to police records, Angela, aka Miss Kitty, was arrested last year for solicitation.
175	00:10:50	00:10:52	Vice made a notation that she was with an Oliver Tate.
176	00:10:52	00:10:55	Cops busted her; they let Tate go.
177	00:10:55	00:10:58	So Larson's telling the truth about Tate knowing Angela.
178	00:10:58	00:11:03	And maybe the blackmail. I spoke to his old boss at PhiloDyne, the biotech company where he worked.
179	00:11:03	00:11:05	Tate was fired for personal indiscretion.
180	00:11:05	00:11:09	After that, he was angry at the company, he was angry at the cops, at the world.
181	00:11:09	00:11:11	He became a recluse.
182	00:11:11	00:11:12	We need to talk to Angela.
183	00:11:12	00:11:15	She's disappeared.
184	00:12:34	00:12:36	How the hell did you get in here?
185	00:12:36	00:12:39	Officer downstairs let me up.
186	00:12:40	00:12:42	You don't want to shoot the messenger.
187	00:12:45	00:12:48	Someone left their Bible and a dowel outside my hotel door with that inside.
188	00:12:48	00:12:50	Instructions to come here.
189	00:12:55	00:12:57	Quote from Dante's Inferno.
190	00:12:57	00:12:58	Inscribed on the Gates of Hell.
191	00:13:07	00:13:10	The King said, Bring me a sword.
192	00:13:10	00:13:12	Divide the child in two.
193	00:13:12	00:13:15	Give half to one and half to the other.
194	00:13:15	00:13:24	By this wisdom... Solomon discerned the worthiness of the one that would lay claim to the child.
195	00:13:24	00:13:27	You can only have one daughter back.
196	00:13:29	00:13:31	You have a decision to make.
197	00:13:31	00:13:33	Or the decision will be made for you.
198	00:13:36	00:13:38	You have six hours.
199	00:13:44	00:13:46	You can only have one daughter back.
200	00:13:46	00:13:48	You have a decision to make.
201	00:13:48	00:13:50	Or the decision will be made for you.
202	00:13:50	00:13:52	You have six hours.
203	00:13:54	00:13:56	Has Brass seen this?
204	00:13:56	00:13:58	Yeah.
205	00:13:58	00:14:04	What I don't understand is why Tate is now sending messages through you. Is there anything you want to tell us?
206	00:14:06	00:14:08	Maybe he knows who I am, what I'm doing here.
207	00:14:08	00:14:11	Wouldn't be the first time that a killer reached out to the press.
208	00:14:11	00:14:13	He's screwing with us. He's using my daughter to do it.
209	00:14:13	00:14:20	He doesn't even say how we're supposed My guess is we're gonna get another flash drive.
210	00:14:20	00:14:24	Well, when you do, why not give Tate an answer? Excuse me?
211	00:14:24	00:14:26	It is the last thing he'd expect.
212	00:14:26	00:14:27	Maybe throw him off his game.
213	00:14:27	00:14:28	No, this isn't a game.
214	00:14:28	00:14:34	And as I recall, the last time you were here, you two convinced me to send my daughter into the arms of a killer.
215	00:14:34	00:14:36	I don't think that's quite fair.
216	00:14:36	00:14:38	No, no. You're right.
217	00:14:38	00:14:40	'Cause I'm the one who made that call.
218	00:14:40	00:14:42	But you two don't have to live with it.
219	00:14:42	00:14:46	I know you said we got nothing, but we better find something soon.
220	00:14:50	00:14:53	Or the decision will be made for you.
221	00:14:55	00:14:57	She keeps looking up.
222	00:14:57	00:14:58	Here, watch this.
223	00:14:58	00:15:00	You have six hours.
224	00:15:01	00:15:02	She keeps looking up.
225	00:15:02	00:15:04	Why is she doing that?
226	00:15:04	00:15:06	Well, she's struggling, she's under duress.
227	00:15:06	00:15:08	No, she's stronger than that.
228	00:15:08	00:15:10	And she's smart.
229	00:15:10	00:15:12	Like you.
230	00:15:12	00:15:13	Why would you be looking up?
231	00:15:13	00:15:16	I would look up to send a message.
232	00:15:19	00:15:20	Did you see Ellie on the video?
233	00:15:20	00:15:24	No, just Morgan, but we have to believe that Ellie's still alive.
234	00:15:27	00:15:29	If you had to choose...
235	00:15:29	00:15:30	We don't have to choose. There's no choosing.
236	00:15:30	00:15:31	This isn't real, Nancy.
237	00:15:31	00:15:32	I know. I'm just saying.
238	00:15:32	00:15:35	Ellie is my daughter.
239	00:15:35	00:15:36	She's my little girl.
240	00:15:36	00:15:39	But she's not a little girl.
241	00:15:39	00:15:41	She's--she's not...
242	00:15:41	00:15:44	six years old. (sighs)
243	00:15:44	00:15:47	Look, I understand.
244	00:15:47	00:15:53	The first six years we were all together, you were a great father.
245	00:15:53	00:15:55	You were a great husband. You were a better man.
246	00:15:55	00:15:56	Until I screwed it up.
247	00:15:56	00:15:57	We screwed it up.
248	00:15:57	00:16:02	So what chance did Ellie have but to do the same thing?
249	00:16:02	00:16:06	Gun to your head, you'd choose the other girl, right?
250	00:16:07	00:16:15	If we get her back, you have to love her not for who she was but for who she is.
251	00:16:21	00:16:26	All this time, all these years, I've been searching for Ellie when she didn't want to be found.
252	00:16:27	00:16:32	I thought, by my sacrifice, I could prove to myself that I still loved her.
253	00:16:32	00:16:35	But you're right.
254	00:16:35	00:16:38	I'd choose the other girl.
255	00:16:38	00:16:43	You know, maybe she's trying to draw our attention to something else in the room. You know, that's what I thought at first.
256	00:16:43	00:16:44	But check this out.
257	00:16:44	00:16:49	Every single time Morgan looks up, there's a spike on the audio track.
258	00:16:49	00:16:51	You have six hours. Maybe if I can isolate it.
259	00:17:00	00:17:02	Low frequency.
260	00:17:02	00:17:03	Power lines?
261	00:17:03	00:17:05	Yeah, but it surges. Then it dissipates.
262	00:17:08	00:17:09	Doppler effect.
263	00:17:09	00:17:10	It's moving.
264	00:17:10	00:17:11	Could be an engine.
265	00:17:11	00:17:13	It sounds like a jet.
266	00:17:13	00:17:15	And it's close to the ground.
267	00:17:15	00:17:17	Taking off or landing?
268	00:17:17	00:17:22	If we can I.D. this audio, we might be able to I.D. the plane.
269	00:17:22	00:17:26	There are several airports around the Vegas area, including Nellis Air Force Base.
270	00:17:26	00:17:30	Yeah, and if we run it against FAA flight logs from the time of the recording, we could have our flight path.
271	00:17:30	00:17:32	And we can narrow down the search area.
272	00:17:34	00:17:35	I processed the dowels in the boat.
273	00:17:35	00:17:39	They were clean, just like the ones that you guys have been finding in the Bibles.
274	00:17:39	00:17:41	If that's a sequence, I'm not sure where to begin.
275	00:17:41	00:17:42	It's ternary code.
276	00:17:42	00:17:48	Like binary code but instead of just having zeros and ones, you have zeros, ones and twos. You're talking about digital encryption?
277	00:17:48	00:17:49	I'm also talking about DNA.
278	00:17:49	00:17:50	In this case.
279	00:17:50	00:17:53	Finn found this in Tate's condo.
280	00:17:53	00:17:57	Synthetic DNA in saline solution.
281	00:17:57	00:18:00	An exact match to the DNA we thought was sweat from our killer.
282	00:18:00	00:18:02	Engineered for data storage.
283	00:18:02	00:18:04	That sounds pretty sci-fi.
284	00:18:04	00:18:07	But Tate did work at a biotech company.
285	00:18:07	00:18:10	Forget about flash drives-- this is the future.
286	00:18:10	00:18:19	So let's say that we wanted to store this digitally on synthetic DNA. First, we would have to translate the pixels into the zeros, ones and twos of ternary code.
287	00:18:19	00:18:23	Then we'd transfer those numbers into the nucleic acids of DNA.
288	00:18:23	00:18:27	The information can be retrieved as long as you have the right decryption key.
289	00:18:27	00:18:31	Tate must have been storing something important, something he wanted to protect.
290	00:18:31	00:18:35	Well, if the dowels are a decryption key, we should be able to read it, right?
291	00:18:35	00:18:37	We'd need the biometric scanners from Tate's company.
292	00:18:37	00:18:38	And a warrant.
293	00:18:38	00:18:39	So let's get a warrant.
294	00:18:42	00:18:44	We shouldn't be doing this.
295	00:18:44	00:18:46	What if he hears us?
296	00:18:46	00:18:49	Just keep listening. I almost got this.
297	00:18:50	00:18:51	It's not gonna work anyway.
298	00:18:51	00:18:53	We're not giving up.
299	00:18:53	00:18:55	Just like the people who are looking for us aren't giving up.
300	00:18:55	00:18:57	Yeah, right.
301	00:18:57	00:18:58	Keep on dreaming. (sighs)
302	00:18:58	00:19:03	Ellie, I know it seems like the world has turned its back on you, but it's not the case.
303	00:19:03	00:19:05	You don't know anything about me.
304	00:19:08	00:19:10	I know a lot more than you think.
305	00:19:10	00:19:13	I know how much your dad cares about you.
306	00:19:13	00:19:18	And how much he misses you and how he would do anything to help you. He's not doing this for me.
307	00:19:18	00:19:21	You know that he's not even my father?
308	00:19:21	00:19:28	Yeah, my real dad is some cop that my mom hooked up with at the bar trying to get back at him for all the bitches he banged.
309	00:19:28	00:19:32	The only thing they ever agreed upon was to lie to me about it, but I found out.
310	00:19:32	00:19:38	From some vice cop in Jersey who busted me after he screwed me.
311	00:19:43	00:19:46	I used to hate my dad, too, you know? Please.
312	00:19:46	00:19:50	Just spare me the speech about how you let go of your past and learned to accept your dad for who he was.
313	00:19:50	00:19:52	All I'm saying is I've seen your parents.
314	00:19:52	00:19:54	It isn't what you think it is.
315	00:19:54	00:19:56	What are you talking about, my parents?
316	00:19:56	00:19:59	Your mom's here.
317	00:19:59	00:20:00	My mom?
318	00:20:00	00:20:02	Your dad called her.
319	00:20:02	00:20:05	They may disagree about most everything, but...
320	00:20:05	00:20:07	they both love you.
321	00:20:07	00:20:11	Well, it doesn't matter because there's no way we're gonna make it out of here alive.
322	00:20:23	00:20:24	Russell.
323	00:20:24	00:20:26	It's me. Angela.
324	00:20:26	00:20:28	Angela, where have you been? We've been looking for you.
325	00:20:28	00:20:32	There's something I should have told you about these murders, about Oliver Tate.
326	00:20:32	00:20:34	I'm scared, Mr. Russell.
327	00:20:34	00:20:35	Tell me where you are right now.
328	00:20:35	00:20:38	At the Fellowship.
329	00:20:38	00:20:41	All right, Angela, I'm gonna send a team over to you right now.
330	00:20:41	00:20:43	No. No, please, Mr. Russell.
331	00:20:43	00:20:46	I don't trust anyone but you.
332	00:20:47	00:20:50	(sighs) All right.
333	00:20:50	00:20:52	All right, okay, I'm on my way.
334	00:20:56	00:20:59	Angela?
335	00:21:24	00:21:26	Oh...
336	00:21:28	00:21:31	Put the phone down.
337	00:21:34	00:21:38	Phone. On the floor.
338	00:21:38	00:21:40	Now.
339	00:21:40	00:21:42	Kick it over here.
340	00:21:49	00:21:54	Whatever Angela did to you, Tate, she did not deserve this.
341	00:21:54	00:21:57	Easy for you to say. She didn't betray you.
342	00:21:57	00:21:59	What do you want? You want... you want me to beg? Is that it?
343	00:21:59	00:22:02	You want me to choose which girl gets to live, you sick...
344	00:22:02	00:22:06	You really have no idea what is happening here, do you?
345	00:22:06	00:22:08	Look, it's just... it's just you and me right now.
346	00:22:08	00:22:12	Tell--tell me what it is you want, and I... and I'll get it for you.
347	00:22:12	00:22:13	I just want the girls back.
348	00:22:13	00:22:17	For a pair of whores, you would cast your own soul into the fire?
349	00:22:17	00:22:21	I would make a deal with the devil himself to get those girls back.
350	00:22:21	00:22:24	Whatever you think of me, I am not the devil.
351	00:22:24	00:22:30	However, I do believe the devil is within your midst.
352	00:22:30	00:22:33	Are you talking about Larson?
353	00:22:33	00:22:36	That's kind of funny, 'cause he said the same thing about you.
354	00:22:36	00:22:38	Except he's been in custody for two days.
355	00:22:38	00:22:43	Kind of hard to kill somebody when you're behind bars, isn't it?
356	00:22:44	00:22:46	Oh, God.
357	00:22:46	00:22:49	I see.
358	00:22:49	00:22:55	Those girls are going to die, and I will be held accountable.
359	00:22:55	00:22:57	You can't stop it.
360	00:22:57	00:22:59	And neither can I.
361	00:23:04	00:23:08	Control, this is Charlie-Zero-One, Russell.
362	00:23:08	00:23:10	I need backup at Fellowship of the Fallen Angels.
363	00:23:10	00:23:13	I'm in pursuit of Oliver Tate.
364	00:23:13	00:23:15	Suspect's driving a silver Taurus.
365	00:23:15	00:23:18	Thomas-David-Henry, Ocean-Three-Four-Seven.
366	00:23:38	00:23:41	Oh, God. What the hell is going on?
367	00:23:41	00:23:42	I thought we had our guy.
368	00:23:42	00:23:43	Who says we didn't?
369	00:23:43	00:23:45	All the signs still point to Tate.
370	00:23:45	00:23:48	They'll be picking up pieces of him till tomorrow morning.
371	00:23:48	00:23:52	I think we're looking for an accomplice who decided to end the partnership.
372	00:23:52	00:23:54	I'm not so sure.
373	00:23:58	00:24:00	Violence.
374	00:24:00	00:24:01	What?
375	00:24:01	00:24:03	Violence.
376	00:24:03	00:24:06	The scattered remains look exactly like the engraving.
377	00:24:06	00:24:07	The Seventh Circle of Hell.
378	00:24:07	00:24:10	I think that Tate was just the next victim.
379	00:24:10	00:24:14	Which means there are now only two circles left.
380	00:24:14	00:24:17	I processed the Bible and the dowel.
381	00:24:17	00:24:18	They're both clean.
382	00:24:18	00:24:22	But there was a SIM card inside the dowel and...
383	00:24:22	00:24:24	a message... for you.
384	00:24:28	00:24:31	The killer wants me to make a call.
385	00:24:31	00:24:36	We're set to run a cell tower trace, for what it's worth.
386	00:24:41	00:24:43	Dad?
387	00:24:43	00:24:44	Ellie.
388	00:24:44	00:24:46	It's time.
389	00:24:46	00:24:49	You have to give me your choice.
390	00:24:51	00:24:53	Ellie...
391	00:24:55	00:24:57	Sweetheart...
392	00:24:57	00:25:00	I can't do that.
393	00:25:00	00:25:02	I know.
394	00:25:30	00:25:31	I was told I'd find you here.
395	00:25:31	00:25:35	I assume this is where you come for answers.
396	00:25:35	00:25:38	Given your reputation, it must work.
397	00:25:38	00:25:39	Well, it's not working now.
398	00:25:44	00:25:48	I know it took you 11 months to find the Gig Harbor Killer...
399	00:25:48	00:25:50	but you did find him.
400	00:25:50	00:25:52	After he had already killed six women.
401	00:25:52	00:25:57	And here I am now with seven dead, and I'm waiting for another body to drop.
402	00:25:57	00:25:59	Maybe a member of my own team.
403	00:25:59	00:26:03	Or at least the daughter of someone very close to me, so...
404	00:26:09	00:26:12	We're trained to follow the evidence, but some--sometimes that's not enough.
405	00:26:12	00:26:15	There... there are times when you need to hear that...
406	00:26:15	00:26:20	that voice in your head that says, Look here.
407	00:26:22	00:26:23	Trouble is, when you...
408	00:26:23	00:26:26	when you've done this job long enough...
409	00:26:26	00:26:29	one day, you stop hearing that voice.
410	00:26:29	00:26:31	And that day has come?
411	00:26:31	00:26:33	Russell.
412	00:26:34	00:26:36	Hey.
413	00:26:36	00:26:38	You have anything?
414	00:26:38	00:26:39	Two things.
415	00:26:39	00:26:41	Doc found skin under Angela's nails.
416	00:26:41	00:26:42	She got a piece of her attacker.
417	00:26:42	00:26:46	Henry ran the DNA, it came back unknown male, so Tate is not our killer.
418	00:26:46	00:26:49	Okay. What--what about the synthetic DNA?
419	00:26:49	00:26:53	I got the warrant. I got Tate's company to decrypt the files.
420	00:26:53	00:26:55	You need to see this.
421	00:26:55	00:27:01	Tate's been using all his DNA gigabytes for one thing-- porn.
422	00:27:01	00:27:03	Guy certainly had a fixation on the Nine Circles of Hell.
423	00:27:03	00:27:05	All of our female victims are here.
424	00:27:05	00:27:07	Yes, but he wasn't killing them.
425	00:27:07	00:27:09	It was sheer fantasy.
426	00:27:09	00:27:12	Pretty clear, also, that Tate was a watcher, not a participant.
427	00:27:12	00:27:15	He was using teenage boys as sexual surrogates.
428	00:27:15	00:27:18	Some of them were pretty young.
429	00:27:18	00:27:23	Our killer, whoever it is, left us evidence of Tate's perversions, right?
430	00:27:23	00:27:27	He's been talking to us in puzzles, in--in code.
431	00:27:27	00:27:30	Like the-the message...
432	00:27:30	00:27:32	the message on the body.
433	00:27:35	00:27:38	Barb... thee... thorns.
434	00:27:41	00:27:43	It's an anagram.
435	00:27:50	00:27:51	That's from Dante's Inferno.
436	00:27:51	00:28:01	Who is in yon fire, that comes so parted at the summit, as it seem'd, ascending from that funeral pile where lay the Theban brothers.
437	00:28:01	00:28:03	Barb... thee... thorns.
438	00:28:03	00:28:05	Theban Brothers.
439	00:28:05	00:28:06	Sons of Oedipus.
440	00:28:06	00:28:09	Cursed for life because of the sins of their father.
441	00:28:09	00:28:12	See, I think we're looking for brothers that Tate used.
442	00:28:12	00:28:13	Hey, Henry!
443	00:28:13	00:28:15	Come here.
444	00:28:15	00:28:18	The skin you got under Angela's nails-- run it against Jake.
445	00:28:27	00:28:29	Hey, D.B. Hi.
446	00:28:29	00:28:32	So it turns out your hunch was right.
447	00:28:32	00:28:33	DNA confirmed it.
448	00:28:33	00:28:37	Angela's killer was a familial match to Jake.
449	00:28:37	00:28:40	Meet his brother-- Matthew Tarland.
450	00:28:40	00:28:44	I pulled a print off the trigger remote that was used in the bomb to kill Tate.
451	00:28:44	00:28:45	Got a hit in AFIS.
452	00:28:45	00:28:50	It turns out that his brother there, Matthew, was busted a couple of years ago for solicitation.
453	00:28:52	00:28:55	There's no way this dude's gonna roll over on his own flesh and blood.
454	00:28:55	00:28:59	All we have him on right now is driving around the block, and he knows it.
455	00:28:59	00:29:08	I just... I just don't see he and his brother going to all this trouble without wanting the world to know what Tate did to them, why Tate had to be punished.
456	00:29:08	00:29:10	Why we all had to be punished, for that matter.
457	00:29:10	00:29:11	Mm-hmm.
458	00:29:11	00:29:15	No, he wants to confess.
459	00:29:15	00:29:17	Just not to us.
460	00:29:17	00:29:20	When they came to me, I proclaimed your innocence.
461	00:29:20	00:29:26	Even though you'd just planted a big, fat, red Judas smack on my cheek, I said, No.
462	00:29:26	00:29:33	He could never have committed these heinous crimes because only one man lives in such dark places.
463	00:29:33	00:29:34	Oliver Tate.
464	00:29:34	00:29:36	Well, you would know. You pimped to him.
465	00:29:36	00:29:37	Yes, I did.
466	00:29:37	00:29:42	Is that why you bore false witness against me?
467	00:29:42	00:29:44	I don't know what you're talking about.
468	00:29:44	00:29:45	Yeah, you do, Jake.
469	00:29:45	00:29:49	You know what you've done-- you and your brother.
470	00:29:49	00:29:54	It seems to me, your brother's kind of left you holding the bag.
471	00:29:54	00:30:00	And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother?
472	00:30:00	00:30:01	And he said, I know not.
473	00:30:03	00:30:05	Am I my brother's keeper?
474	00:30:05	00:30:07	Am I my brother's keeper?
475	00:30:10	00:30:12	A boy came to me once.
476	00:30:12	00:30:13	A little boy.
477	00:30:13	00:30:20	He'd been cast out onto the street with his brother by a man who, father-like, promised them everything...
478	00:30:22	00:30:24	...but instead...
479	00:30:24	00:30:26	used them.
480	00:30:26	00:30:28	Twisted their souls.
481	00:30:28	00:30:31	Do you remember that boy?
482	00:30:31	00:30:34	Yes, I do.
483	00:30:34	00:30:38	But he's... dead. I think there is still love in your heart.
484	00:30:38	00:30:43	Not for me, but for someone...
485	00:30:43	00:30:49	someone who gave that life to you unconditionally, who's been repaid in blood.
486	00:30:53	00:30:56	I think you need to look at this.
487	00:30:57	00:30:59	Recognize your brother's work?
488	00:31:02	00:31:03	You're lying.
489	00:31:03	00:31:06	This is a trick.
490	00:31:06	00:31:08	No, Matthew would never...
491	00:31:08	00:31:11	He--he knows how much I care about Angela. No.
492	00:31:11	00:31:13	Jake, your brother killed her.
493	00:31:13	00:31:16	He posed her just like all the other girls. No!
494	00:31:16	00:31:18	You are your brother's keeper.
495	00:31:18	00:31:25	You are responsible for what he's done and what he will do to two more girls that have nothing to do with what happened to you.
496	00:31:27	00:31:29	We know he's in that area right there.
497	00:31:29	00:31:31	We are all sinners.
498	00:31:31	00:31:34	We all need redemption.
499	00:31:34	00:31:37	This is your chance.
500	00:31:55	00:31:58	So what's the deal with the mask anyway?
501	00:31:58	00:32:00	Why are you so scared to show your face?
502	00:32:02	00:32:04	You're just going to kill us.
503	00:32:04	00:32:08	Or is that it?
504	00:32:08	00:32:12	You don't have the guts to look us in the eye when you do it.
505	00:32:16	00:32:18	This what you wanted?
506	00:32:18	00:32:22	Take a good look. It's the last thing you're going to see.
507	00:32:22	00:32:25	I'm going to make you feel everything.
508	00:32:32	00:32:33	Lock him up.
509	00:32:38	00:32:40	Wait. What?
510	00:32:40	00:32:41	I think there might be another girl.
511	00:32:41	00:32:42	What do you mean?
512	00:32:42	00:32:46	When he had me on the phone, I think I heard another girl. Are you sure? Where?
513	00:32:46	00:32:48	I don't know. Maybe in another room.
514	00:32:50	00:32:52	Run! I'll catch up.
515	00:32:54	00:32:55	Hello?
516	00:32:57	00:32:59	Anybody in here?
517	00:33:19	00:33:21	Come down here.
518	00:33:34	00:33:37	Get down on your knees.
519	00:33:47	00:33:51	Told you I was gonna make you feel everything.
520	00:33:57	00:33:59	No!
521	00:34:00	00:34:02	Let her go.
522	00:34:25	00:34:27	Thank you for coming back for me.
523	00:34:27	00:34:29	Come on, let's get out of here.
524	00:34:55	00:34:57	What do you got?
525	00:34:57	00:34:58	He's dead, Jim.
526	00:35:00	00:35:07	Ellie. ELLIE He shot her. I tried to get the gun from him, but I couldn't-- he was too strong, and he... It's okay. It's okay.
527	00:35:07	00:35:09	Her pulse is weak, but she's alive.
528	00:35:09	00:35:11	Control, this is Captain Brass.
529	00:35:11	00:35:12	Officer down.
530	00:35:12	00:35:14	Need medevac. My location. Code Three.
531	00:35:22	00:35:29	Ellie said Morgan got the girls out of there, but Matthew just... chased 'em down, shot Morgan right in the back.
532	00:35:29	00:35:34	Then he tackles her, there's a struggle, the gun drops, she shoots him.
533	00:35:35	00:35:37	What about Morgan?
534	00:35:37	00:35:38	In surgery.
535	00:35:38	00:35:42	Doctors say anything? Nothing yet.
536	00:35:48	00:35:50	Finished the trace reports.
537	00:35:50	00:35:53	Morgan's in surgery, so I thought I'd... Go.
538	00:35:53	00:35:56	Thanks.
539	00:35:56	00:35:57	It's a good thing the kid was a bad shot.
540	00:35:57	00:35:59	Ellie was lucky, too.
541	00:35:59	00:36:02	You know, she only got off the one round, the kill shot.
542	00:36:02	00:36:04	I found, um...
543	00:36:04	00:36:06	debris... in the firing mechanism.
544	00:36:06	00:36:09	Maybe from the struggle.
545	00:36:09	00:36:11	Kid on top of her, wrestling in the dirt.
546	00:36:11	00:36:13	On top of her?
547	00:36:13	00:36:16	Don't think so-- at least not when Ellie fired the gun.
548	00:36:16	00:36:17	There was no GSR on his shirt.
549	00:36:17	00:36:20	She had to be at least four feet away from him.
550	00:36:22	00:36:23	Traumatic event.
551	00:36:23	00:36:26	People remember things differently, I guess.
552	00:36:26	00:36:27	Not that differently.
553	00:36:27	00:36:28	Call me from the hospital, okay?
554	00:36:28	00:36:30	With an update.
555	00:36:30	00:36:34	Nick found Matthew Tarland's cell phone at the scene, right?
556	00:36:34	00:36:35	Yeah. I'm going over his e-mails now.
557	00:36:35	00:36:37	Okay, forget the e-mails for now.
558	00:36:37	00:36:38	I need to see the photos right away.
559	00:36:38	00:36:40	What are you looking for? I'll know when I see it.
560	00:36:43	00:36:45	Whoa. That's Ellie Brass with our killer.
561	00:36:47	00:36:54	Uh, metadata says the photos were taken a year ago in Jersey City. Nancy told Brass that Ellie brought a guy home with her last year, said that he was her fiancé.
562	00:36:54	00:36:57	Wait, so Brass's daughter knew Matthew Tarland?
563	00:36:57	00:36:58	She's been lying to us.
564	00:37:00	00:37:03	D.B., we have a situation.
565	00:37:03	00:37:04	Is Brass still at the hospital?
566	00:37:06	00:37:08	When did he leave?
567	00:37:12	00:37:14	Hey. It's me.
568	00:37:14	00:37:15	Got some moo goo gai pan.
569	00:37:15	00:37:17	Your guys' favorite, right?
570	00:37:17	00:37:19	Nancy?
571	00:37:22	00:37:24	Ellie?
572	00:37:30	00:37:32	Nancy?
573	00:37:46	00:37:48	Ellie?
574	00:37:48	00:37:50	Right here, Dad.
575	00:37:53	00:37:55	You gonna get that?
576	00:37:57	00:37:59	You shouldn't have dragged Mom out here.
577	00:37:59	00:38:01	She saw me with Matthew.
578	00:38:01	00:38:02	I had no choice.
579	00:38:02	00:38:07	You should have just kept this between you and me.
580	00:38:07	00:38:08	Why?
581	00:38:08	00:38:15	Matthew and Jake had their daddy issues, and, thanks to you... so do I.
582	00:38:15	00:38:17	You--you and the boys--you did...?
583	00:38:17	00:38:19	You did this?
584	00:38:19	00:38:25	When I had you on the phone, I asked you to make a choice.
585	00:38:25	00:38:26	Oh, my God.
586	00:38:26	00:38:32	You tried saving me my entire life, and you could have saved me then, but, oh, no.
587	00:38:32	00:38:34	Like always...
588	00:38:35	00:38:37	...you had to be the cop.
589	00:38:37	00:38:41	Sounds like someone wants to get your attention pretty bad.
590	00:38:41	00:38:44	I know what that's like.
591	00:38:46	00:38:50	You killed the only person I ever loved.
592	00:38:53	00:38:55	The only person who ever loved you.
593	00:38:58	00:39:02	Ellie, you want to shoot me...
594	00:39:08	00:39:10	...go ahead.
595	00:39:11	00:39:13	Because...
596	00:39:13	00:39:15	I'm dead already.
597	00:39:18	00:39:20	What happened?
598	00:39:20	00:39:22	LVPD!
599	00:39:27	00:39:29	Give me the gun.
600	00:39:59	00:40:01	Hey. Hey, hey.
601	00:40:01	00:40:02	Dad.
602	00:40:02	00:40:05	Uh, uh, El--Ellie... Yeah. We know.
603	00:40:05	00:40:06	She's in custody. Don't worry.
604	00:40:08	00:40:10	You are gonna be okay.
605	00:40:13	00:40:15	But you know what?
606	00:40:17	00:40:21	You and I really need to steer clear of hospitals from now on.
607	00:40:28	00:40:30	Thought you'd already left.
608	00:40:32	00:40:34	Not without saying good-bye.
609	00:40:34	00:40:35	Did you get your story?
610	00:40:35	00:40:38	Yes. Yes, I did.
611	00:40:38	00:40:39	Although it's not really the story I came here to write.
612	00:40:39	00:40:41	Should the mayor be worried?
613	00:40:41	00:40:44	It's not a hatchet job, if that's what you're thinking.
614	00:40:46	00:40:48	Doesn't all just go into the box, does it?
615	00:40:51	00:40:53	No.
616	00:40:55	00:40:58	There is one question I never got to ask you.
617	00:40:58	00:41:05	That voice inside your head-- the day that it does go quiet...
618	00:41:05	00:41:07	do you think that that will bring you peace?
619	00:41:09	00:41:11	Or will it be a loss too great to bear?
620	00:41:15	00:41:21	And so we gather together today to mourn the loss of our sister Nancy...
621	00:41:21	00:41:24	taken from this life all too soon.
622	00:41:24	00:41:40	In grief, we throw our arms around our brother Jim, and we pray that his journey with Nancy to her final resting place will bring them both peace.
623	00:41:40	00:41:44	The lesson of Job is clear.
624	00:41:44	00:41:52	Even in a moment of immeasurable sorrow like this one, we're given a choice.
625	00:41:54	00:42:03	A choice between the hopelessness of despair, and the everlasting promise of faith.
626	00:42:03	00:42:06	Faith...
627	00:42:06	00:42:07	that there is a plan.
628	00:42:07	00:42:18	And that in times of doubt, God will speak to us in a voice that is clear and true.
