0	00:00:19	00:00:24	What's going on? You bring in a high-risk psychopath into my department and you don't even bother to call me?
1	00:00:24	00:00:26	I mean, were you two gonna fly this over my head?
2	00:00:26	00:00:30	Haskell reached out from prison, said he had something to offer in the Dr. Jekyll case.
3	00:00:30	00:00:32	The man called me. Yeah, and he hung up on you.
4	00:00:32	00:00:34	Why didn't you just call him back?
5	00:00:34	00:00:37	You don't have to send a limo for him like Paul freakin' McCartney.
6	00:00:39	00:00:42	The last time we gave him a stage, somebody got killed.
7	00:00:42	00:00:43	This was my decision, Jim.
8	00:00:43	00:00:47	I called the governor, and the governor cleared it through the sheriff.
9	00:00:47	00:00:48	Both friends of Daddy.
10	00:00:48	00:00:53	You know, it's amazing, but Sam Braun has more clout dead than most of us do alive.
11	00:00:53	00:00:55	My team is working a serial killer case.
12	00:00:55	00:00:58	We've got zippo leads, and the bodies are piling up.
13	00:00:58	00:01:00	What do you think I'm doing, writing parking tickets?
14	00:01:00	00:01:02	Hey, last time I checked, CSI worked for me.
15	00:01:02	00:01:04	And have you been doing lately on the case, Jim?
16	00:01:04	00:01:06	You develop any better leads?
17	00:01:06	00:01:08	Are you saying I'm not doing my job?
18	00:01:08	00:01:09	We're all doing our jobs.
19	00:01:10	00:01:13	And if Nate Haskell knows anything, we should hear what he has to say.
20	00:01:14	00:01:18	If he starts screwing with us, we just ship him back to Ely and weld his cage shut.
21	00:01:38	00:01:40	Las Vegas.
22	00:01:42	00:01:44	Hands up.
23	00:01:44	00:01:45	This is a stun belt.
24	00:01:45	00:01:48	My own private electric fence.
25	00:01:48	00:01:50	That's exciting.
26	00:01:53	00:01:55	Let's go.
27	00:02:06	00:02:08	Hiya. Glad to be back here. Nice to be here.
28	00:02:09	00:02:13	Oh. I hear crime is down three quarters in a row.
29	00:02:13	00:02:14	Good work. Hey, keep that up.
30	00:02:14	00:02:16	Let's be careful out there.
31	00:02:25	00:02:29	Well, Ray, he's all yours. Wait a minute. What? What?
32	00:02:29	00:02:31	Ray's the one he wants to talk to-- they have the connection.
33	00:02:31	00:02:32	Hold on.
34	00:02:32	00:02:34	Nobody's going in there without me.
35	00:02:37	00:02:39	Do it, Officer, press the button.
36	00:02:39	00:02:41	I hear it's better than sex with your wife.
37	00:02:41	00:02:46	One more word, I'll have sparks coming out of your ears, you son of a bitch.
38	00:02:46	00:02:47	Oh, looky.
39	00:02:47	00:02:57	Hate to start this off with a complaint, but on the way in, there was no food service, I didn't get a window seat, and the stewardesses all had assault rifles.
40	00:02:57	00:03:00	Plus they're... really ugly.
41	00:03:00	00:03:04	I thought you wanted to talk, and then you hung up on me.
42	00:03:04	00:03:06	Were your feelings hurt?
43	00:03:06	00:03:10	Tell me what happened to the unsettled, bearded fellow.
44	00:03:10	00:03:11	Griswald?
45	00:03:11	00:03:13	Gristle?
46	00:03:13	00:03:15	He's pursuing other things.
47	00:03:15	00:03:19	So that means you've taken his place?
48	00:03:19	00:03:21	Isn't that a bit of a comedown, Professor?
49	00:03:21	00:03:23	Although...
50	00:03:23	00:03:31	I suppose who better for a low-level job in law enforcement than a doctor who allowed 27 people to die before his watchful eyes.
51	00:03:31	00:03:32	Shut up, Haskell.
52	00:03:32	00:03:37	You were brought here because you said you had information about the Jekyll murders.
53	00:03:37	00:03:38	Start talking.
54	00:03:38	00:03:39	Which is it, shut up or start talking?
55	00:03:39	00:03:40	I don't think I like you.
56	00:03:40	00:03:42	I don't want to play with you at all.
57	00:03:42	00:03:46	Nate, you said you had information about Dr. Jekyll-- let's have it.
58	00:03:46	00:03:56	Okay. After I was arrested, when the police confiscated my belongings, they took something from my dresser drawer, top right.
59	00:03:56	00:03:58	You'll find it in evidence.
60	00:03:58	00:04:00	Oh, I'm sure you've got boxes and boxes...
61	00:04:00	00:04:05	Nick, get all of Haskell's evidence out of storage, and bring it to the lab.
62	00:04:05	00:04:12	Obviously, the coppers didn't realize its significance, and frankly, when I was given this beautiful gift...
63	00:04:12	00:04:15	I didn't, either.
64	00:04:15	00:04:18	I felt, at the time, it was more like a...
65	00:04:18	00:04:21	promise.
66	00:04:21	00:04:25	A talisman from a like-minded soul.
67	00:04:26	00:04:29	But...
68	00:04:29	00:04:32	given recent events, uh...
69	00:04:32	00:04:41	I kept it in a beautiful lacquer box, adorned with a dragon, which I had picked up on a trip down the Yangtze River.
70	00:04:41	00:04:45	Actually, I bought it in Chinatown, but...
71	00:04:45	00:04:48	I do have a weakness for embellishment.
72	00:04:59	00:05:01	I think I got it.
73	00:05:25	00:05:26	Pasta?
74	00:05:26	00:05:28	Weird.
75	00:05:29	00:05:31	Bow-tie pasta...
76	00:05:32	00:05:36	tied with a spaghetti bow.
77	00:05:38	00:05:39	They're identical.
78	00:05:39	00:05:43	Haskell's telling the truth.
79	00:05:43	00:05:45	He knows who Jekyll is.
80	00:06:26	00:06:32	A monster like Haskell kills 19 people, and you see him up close and personal, he looks just like everybody else.
81	00:06:32	00:06:34	Mm-hmm.
82	00:06:35	00:06:39	You got a lot of guts bringing him down here.
83	00:06:39	00:06:41	But that's what I like about you.
84	00:06:42	00:06:45	Now I know why you got up so early this morning.
85	00:06:45	00:06:47	I wish I'd stayed in bed.
86	00:06:47	00:06:49	Well...
87	00:06:49	00:06:50	me, too.
88	00:06:54	00:06:56	Here you go.
89	00:07:00	00:07:02	Why am I always the last to know? Hm?
90	00:07:02	00:07:06	Call Hodges, see what he can do with that.
91	00:07:06	00:07:10	It's so funny how you cops come up with your nicknames for serial killers.
92	00:07:10	00:07:17	(chuckles) The... the Night Stalker, the Hillside Strangler, the Iceman.
93	00:07:17	00:07:18	I'm the Dick and Jane Killer.
94	00:07:18	00:07:22	Kind of makes me sound so... immature.
95	00:07:22	00:07:24	How do you know Jekyll?
96	00:07:24	00:07:26	Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde?
97	00:07:26	00:07:28	Do you guys even read?
98	00:07:28	00:07:30	Robert Louis Stevenson? Hello?
99	00:07:30	00:07:35	Jekyll was the good guy? Well, why don't you be the good guy and give us a name?
100	00:07:37	00:07:39	How do you know Jekyll?
101	00:07:39	00:07:44	Well... since you ask, I met him in a restaurant.
102	00:07:44	00:07:47	All of his victims were there.
103	00:07:47	00:07:50	Before he was Jekyll, of course.
104	00:07:51	00:07:53	That was, oh...
105	00:07:53	00:07:55	heavens, ten, no...
106	00:07:55	00:07:59	11 years ago. (chuckles)
107	00:07:59	00:08:00	My, how time crawls.
108	00:08:00	00:08:03	He hadn't discovered his...
109	00:08:03	00:08:09	potential yet, back then, back when I was free to be me.
110	00:08:09	00:08:14	It was so... unexpected.
111	00:08:17	00:08:21	So captivating.
112	00:08:21	00:08:24	I knew there was genius behind it.
113	00:08:24	00:08:26	Come on-- pasta?
114	00:08:26	00:08:29	I asked if I could meet the chef.
115	00:08:31	00:08:32	What do you call this?
116	00:08:32	00:08:34	I'll take it back if you like.
117	00:08:34	00:08:36	No, no, I like it, I like it a lot.
118	00:08:36	00:08:38	You're very talented. Sit.
119	00:08:40	00:08:44	I spoke to him. I liked him, Dr. Langston.
120	00:08:44	00:08:45	He was mad as a hatter.
121	00:08:45	00:08:47	What is that mess?
122	00:08:47	00:08:49	What's the matter with you?
123	00:08:49	00:08:51	Nobody wants to see that crap floating in their food.
124	00:08:51	00:08:53	Get back in the kitchen.
125	00:08:53	00:08:55	Excuse me. I'm sorry if he bothered you, sir.
126	00:08:56	00:08:57	I'll get you another plate of pasta.
127	00:08:57	00:08:58	This is good. I'll keep this...
128	00:08:58	00:09:00	No, please, let me get some more pasta... Leave it!
129	00:09:00	00:09:05	Dr. Langston, choosing a partner-- it's intuitive.
130	00:09:05	00:09:09	It comes from a place deep inside of you.
131	00:09:09	00:09:10	What, like your colon?
132	00:09:10	00:09:12	Could we get a private room?
133	00:09:12	00:09:14	There's a fly buzzing in here.
134	00:09:14	00:09:18	Take this psychopath, send him back to Hell and throw away the key. Jim...
135	00:09:19	00:09:21	Could I have a few minutes with him?
136	00:09:21	00:09:23	Take all the time you want.
137	00:09:30	00:09:32	Nice bad-cop routine.
138	00:09:32	00:09:34	Yeah, well, I wasn't acting.
139	00:09:34	00:09:35	I need a name.
140	00:09:35	00:09:38	And I'm just so bad with names.
141	00:09:40	00:09:43	I did talk to him, though, Dr. Langston.
142	00:09:43	00:09:45	And he opened up to me.
143	00:09:46	00:09:47	The right ones always do.
144	00:09:48	00:09:51	He's a late bloomer, but...
145	00:09:51	00:09:55	he seems to be making quite a splash now.
146	00:09:55	00:09:56	What was the name of the restaurant?
147	00:09:56	00:09:59	All this food talk is making me so hungry.
148	00:09:59	00:10:02	I wonder whether a nice steak dinner would jog my memory.
149	00:10:02	00:10:10	I'll have the rib eye, rare, baked potato, sour cream, chives; for dessert, berry pie-- if it's in season-- and I'll have it รก la mode.
150	00:10:10	00:10:13	If you want to get something...
151	00:10:13	00:10:15	you have to give me something.
152	00:10:16	00:10:23	Let's be perfectly clear-- you need me, and I need you.
153	00:10:23	00:10:27	I'm gonna die in prison, so I'm gonna have some fun.
154	00:10:27	00:10:30	If you don't like it, send me back to Ely.
155	00:10:31	00:10:34	Let the good doctor continue his work.
156	00:10:34	00:10:36	I want my steak bloody.
157	00:10:36	00:10:39	So, the sheriff has given us 48 hours, then he ships Haskell back.
158	00:10:40	00:10:44	Haskell said he was in a restaurant that serves pasta with a piano bar.
159	00:10:44	00:10:46	Jekyll was there, so were three of his victims.
160	00:10:46	00:10:49	All in the same place at the same time. Oh, that's convenient.
161	00:10:49	00:10:50	I don't believe it.
162	00:10:50	00:10:51	He's lying for fresh air.
163	00:10:51	00:10:53	Yeah. But there is the pasta.
164	00:10:53	00:11:03	Haskell's not a magician, right, and we had that in evidence way before Joey Bigelow's surgery. He likes to mix the truth with lies. Let's run down this restaurant-- if it exists-- see which is which.
165	00:11:03	00:11:08	Joey Bigelow may have been playing some gigs back then, so there could be tax records, pay stubs...
166	00:11:08	00:11:09	Joey had an agent.
167	00:11:09	00:11:12	His name was, um, Marty Felnick.
168	00:11:12	00:11:13	I know Marty.
169	00:11:13	00:11:16	I sat on his lap a few times, back in the day.
170	00:11:16	00:11:18	When you were a little girl?
171	00:11:18	00:11:20	No, when I was a big girl.
172	00:11:20	00:11:23	So, if he's still alive, I'll find him.
173	00:11:23	00:11:27	Okay, we should get credit card receipts for Jekyll's victims, see if there was an overlap 11 years ago.
174	00:11:28	00:11:30	I'll take Higgins. I got Herson.
175	00:11:30	00:11:32	And I'll call Reno PD, get Haskell's financials.
176	00:11:34	00:11:36	Thank you.
177	00:11:36	00:11:38	Mr. Felnick?
178	00:11:39	00:11:41	I'm Catherine Willows.
179	00:11:41	00:11:43	I'm with the crime lab.
180	00:11:43	00:11:45	I was wondering when you guys would show up.
181	00:11:45	00:11:46	Hmm.
182	00:11:46	00:11:48	This is about Joe-Joe, right?
183	00:11:48	00:11:51	Yes. Yes, sir, it is.
184	00:11:52	00:11:54	I heard that you were with him from the beginning.
185	00:11:54	00:11:57	From before the beginning, young lady.
186	00:11:57	00:11:59	Now it's after the end, isn't it?
187	00:11:59	00:12:02	Whew.
188	00:12:02	00:12:04	The man had such talent.
189	00:12:04	00:12:06	He drank, though.
190	00:12:06	00:12:09	But I mean, from the bottom of the bottle-- he drank.
191	00:12:09	00:12:12	Dumb bastard-- he threw it all away.
192	00:12:12	00:12:18	Do you recall if Joey was playing any restaurant gigs about ten or 11 years ago?
193	00:12:18	00:12:20	You know, you're a very attractive woman.
194	00:12:20	00:12:22	Did anybody ever tell you that?
195	00:12:22	00:12:23	Thank you.
196	00:12:23	00:12:25	But one time, I do remember he came to me.
197	00:12:25	00:12:29	I remember this time, he wanted me to come see him play.
198	00:12:29	00:12:30	It was like a comeback, you know?
199	00:12:30	00:12:34	It was only a one-night thing in some kind of joint.
200	00:12:34	00:12:36	He not only lost his touch...
201	00:12:37	00:12:39	...he stiffed me for dinner.
202	00:12:39	00:12:41	Do you remember the name of the place?
203	00:12:41	00:12:44	No, but I remember the $150 he took from me.
204	00:12:46	00:12:47	That I remember.
205	00:12:47	00:12:50	The joint-- it was...
206	00:12:50	00:12:56	It was west of the 15, as driving, and south of the 95.
207	00:12:56	00:12:57	That's where it was.
208	00:12:57	00:13:00	Could you show me where, on this map?
209	00:13:00	00:13:02	You got a map? Mm-hmm.
210	00:13:02	00:13:04	Hm-hm!
211	00:13:04	00:13:05	Huh.
212	00:13:05	00:13:07	Somewhere around here.
213	00:13:07	00:13:11	Sweetheart, you are very familiar.
214	00:13:11	00:13:13	We knew each other, something.
215	00:13:13	00:13:16	I bet you say that to all the cops. (laughs)
216	00:13:18	00:13:21	Haskell's never filed an income tax form in his life.
217	00:13:21	00:13:23	He's never had a job there's any record of.
218	00:13:23	00:13:24	He's very smart.
219	00:13:24	00:13:25	He made himself invisible.
220	00:13:25	00:13:27	I talked to Marty Felnick.
221	00:13:27	00:13:32	Joey played piano in a restaurant in roughly the vicinity where we found his body.
222	00:13:32	00:13:33	I didn't get the name, though.
223	00:13:33	00:13:37	I found this picture in Herson's evidence.
224	00:13:37	00:13:40	His shirt is from Venetti's.
225	00:13:40	00:13:41	Which is on that side of town.
226	00:13:42	00:13:44	Bernie Higgins ate out breakfast, lunch and dinner.
227	00:13:44	00:13:46	And he went to Venetti's at least once a week.
228	00:14:01	00:14:04	We're here. Let's have a look around.
229	00:14:05	00:14:07	I'll get it.
230	00:14:35	00:14:36	What do you know?
231	00:14:36	00:14:40	Farfalle-- homemade bow tie pasta.
232	00:14:43	00:14:45	Found their business license.
233	00:14:45	00:14:47	Expired five years ago.
234	00:14:56	00:14:59	Joe-Joe Bigelow-- he's on the wall.
235	00:15:05	00:15:06	Bernard Higgins here.
236	00:15:09	00:15:11	Yeah, Herson...
237	00:15:11	00:15:13	is here, as well.
238	00:15:13	00:15:15	Looks like Haskell was telling the truth.
239	00:15:15	00:15:18	I'd like to be the one to tell Brass.
240	00:15:20	00:15:22	Catherine, hey, I got the information you asked for.
241	00:15:22	00:15:26	I called the Clark County Assessor and got the names of the three co-owners of Venetti's.
242	00:15:26	00:15:27	Oh, great. I'll call them.
243	00:15:27	00:15:28	Yeah, uh, they're dead.
244	00:15:28	00:15:31	Two of them were low-level Italian mobsters.
245	00:15:31	00:15:32	They're brothers.
246	00:15:32	00:15:36	Apparently, they got sent through a wood chipper in Brime County a few years back.
247	00:15:36	00:15:37	Okay.
248	00:15:37	00:15:39	The third is a Hasidic bookie.
249	00:15:39	00:15:50	According to Vice, the last thing they saw of his before he vanished were the charred remains of his bookie receipts and a yarmulke on the roof of the, uh, Silver Vista Athletic Club. Elroy Wax?
250	00:15:50	00:15:53	How did you know? My father used to place bets with him all the time.
251	00:15:53	00:15:55	Hell, I placed a few myself.
252	00:15:55	00:15:56	Uncle Elroy? He's dead?
253	00:15:56	00:15:57	Sorry.
254	00:15:57	00:16:00	Here-- I also got a list of the restaurant's employees from the IRS.
255	00:16:01	00:16:05	If we're to believe Haskell, one of these guys has got to be Jekyll.
256	00:16:07	00:16:09	Jekyll's forehead wasn't that big.
257	00:16:09	00:16:11	You said bulging.
258	00:16:11	00:16:13	I said prominent.
259	00:16:13	00:16:15	Make it wider, flatter.
260	00:16:15	00:16:16	Chin is too weak.
261	00:16:16	00:16:20	Where did you learn to draw, my dear-- Sketch Bambi contest?
262	00:16:22	00:16:30	It's better, but the eyes more wide-set, and jaw more square, more patrician.
263	00:16:30	00:16:33	Do you know what that means? Patrician?
264	00:16:36	00:16:37	That's perfect.
265	00:16:40	00:16:41	Do you like it, Dr. Langston?
266	00:16:41	00:16:43	I made it for you.
267	00:16:43	00:16:44	You can go.
268	00:16:44	00:16:46	Mm.
269	00:16:46	00:16:47	Bye, my dear.
270	00:16:52	00:16:55	Do you, uh, recognize this place?
271	00:16:56	00:16:59	It looks familiar.
272	00:16:59	00:17:01	It's come on hard times, hasn't it?
273	00:17:01	00:17:04	Things are so tough out there; everybody out of work.
274	00:17:04	00:17:07	That's the thing about two consecutive life sentences.
275	00:17:07	00:17:09	Mortgage is paid.
276	00:17:09	00:17:11	Three hots and a cot.
277	00:17:11	00:17:15	Must be hard for you to indulge your hobbies from inside.
278	00:17:15	00:17:21	When you consider Dr. Jekyll is out there, free to continue his practice.
279	00:17:21	00:17:26	You don't get that many opportunities to, uh, Dick and Jane around, do you?
280	00:17:26	00:17:27	Mm.
281	00:17:27	00:17:34	We confirmed that all of Dr. Jekyll's victims did visit this restaurant, this, uh, Venetti's.
282	00:17:34	00:17:37	Venetti's.
283	00:17:38	00:17:39	Yes.
284	00:17:40	00:17:42	Good work, Ray.
285	00:17:44	00:17:46	So you saw the Wall of Fame?
286	00:17:46	00:17:48	This is working great.
287	00:17:48	00:17:51	I give you good information, you give me a good steak.
288	00:17:51	00:17:54	I have a list of names here, Nate.
289	00:17:54	00:17:55	I wonder...
290	00:17:55	00:17:58	if you see the young man's name on this list?
291	00:18:01	00:18:03	Oh, yeah, I see it.
292	00:18:03	00:18:05	What is his name?
293	00:18:06	00:18:09	Ray...
294	00:18:09	00:18:11	you know this is a barter system.
295	00:18:11	00:18:16	You gave me good steak, I got you to the place.
296	00:18:16	00:18:19	Now, I need a little something else.
297	00:18:24	00:18:29	You know that we are running down these names, which means that your information won't be very valuable for very long.
298	00:18:30	00:18:33	Maybe long enough for someone to die.
299	00:18:33	00:18:35	Be careful, Doctor.
300	00:18:35	00:18:38	You might be the next victim.
301	00:18:38	00:18:40	Is that a game you want to play?
302	00:19:05	00:19:07	She's for Haskell.
303	00:19:35	00:19:36	That's enough, thank you.
304	00:19:36	00:19:38	I need a name, Nate.
305	00:19:38	00:19:40	You're interrupting a performance! It's very rude!
306	00:19:40	00:19:43	Yes-- I need his name, Nate.
307	00:19:47	00:19:49	Carlo Parini.
308	00:19:49	00:19:50	You sure?
309	00:19:50	00:19:51	Haskell, get back!
310	00:19:52	00:19:54	Enjoy yourself.
311	00:19:56	00:19:58	Carlo Parini.
312	00:19:58	00:20:00	Let's see if we can find this guy.
313	00:20:00	00:20:01	I'm betting he's got a sheet.
314	00:20:01	00:20:03	See? What did I tell you?
315	00:20:03	00:20:08	Carlo Parini-- he's in Ely, finishing up a five-year stint for hit-and-run manslaughter.
316	00:20:08	00:20:11	So, your friend Haskell has got himself a free lap dance in jail.
317	00:20:11	00:20:16	Look, Haskell is smart enough to know that we were going to come at him with this list.
318	00:20:16	00:20:19	If he gives us nothing, the game's over.
319	00:20:19	00:20:20	He gets nothing.
320	00:20:20	00:20:22	There's got to be something here, Jim.
321	00:20:22	00:20:24	He's making us work for it.
322	00:20:28	00:20:30	Dr. Ray?
323	00:20:30	00:20:31	Yes.
324	00:20:31	00:20:33	Yeah. Uh, I accepted a package for you.
325	00:20:33	00:20:36	It was marked perishable, so I put it in the lunch fridge.
326	00:20:36	00:20:38	Thank you. It's from a James Langston.
327	00:20:38	00:20:39	Is that a relative of yours?
328	00:20:40	00:20:41	My dad.
329	00:20:41	00:20:43	Oh, that's nice.
330	00:20:43	00:20:45	He's been dead for ten years.
331	00:20:59	00:21:03	We lived in Delaware for a while, when I was a kid.
332	00:21:03	00:21:05	Maybe it's some kind of sick joke.
333	00:21:05	00:21:06	Or something worse.
334	00:21:06	00:21:12	Hmm. No batteries, no switches, no timers.
335	00:21:12	00:21:16	It doesn't look like a bomb, or any body part.
336	00:21:17	00:21:19	Well...
337	00:21:19	00:21:21	let's take a look.
338	00:21:24	00:21:26	See what we can see.
339	00:21:37	00:21:40	Hmm. It's my old I.D. badge.
340	00:21:40	00:21:42	Jekyll's come out to play.
341	00:21:55	00:21:56	Whoa.
342	00:22:00	00:22:02	Looks like homemade beef jerky.
343	00:22:02	00:22:04	Or homemade people jerky.
344	00:22:04	00:22:07	You can't tell by looking at it.
345	00:22:07	00:22:10	That's da Vinci's Vitruvian man.
346	00:22:10	00:22:13	Looks to be hand-drawn, with great precision.
347	00:22:13	00:22:15	Tattooed on meat?
348	00:22:17	00:22:19	NAYL?
349	00:22:19	00:22:22	That's text speak for in a while.
350	00:22:29	00:22:30	I have no idea what that is.
351	00:22:34	00:22:37	It appears to be a propeller of some kind.
352	00:22:40	00:22:42	An angel.
353	00:22:42	00:22:44	That number's a John Doe.
354	00:22:44	00:22:45	David?
355	00:22:48	00:22:50	John Does are over here.
356	00:22:50	00:22:53	Uh, help Nick move these bodies, would you?
357	00:23:10	00:23:13	JD-09-1157.
358	00:23:13	00:23:14	Day shift case.
359	00:23:14	00:23:16	December 2, 2009.
360	00:23:16	00:23:17	It's a typical body dump.
361	00:23:17	00:23:22	Okay, that's a couple of months after Joey Bigelow, and a couple of days before Bernard Higgins was worked on.
362	00:23:22	00:23:23	What was C.O.D.?
363	00:23:23	00:23:25	Uh, exsanguination due to a stab wound.
364	00:23:25	00:23:26	Stab wound?
365	00:23:27	00:23:34	An unusual sharp-force injury, wider at the entrance, consistent with a typical, single-edged knife wound for the first three inches.
366	00:23:34	00:23:42	then extending another three inches is a roughly circular, eighth-inch-diameter wound track, which appears to have perforated the appendicular artery.
367	00:23:42	00:23:46	And eighth-inch-diameter wound that deep would be consistent...
368	00:23:46	00:23:48	with a laparoscopic penetration.
369	00:23:48	00:23:55	And the appendicular artery-- Jekyll surgically implanted a septic appendix into Bernie Higgins.
370	00:23:55	00:23:58	Maybe the appendix was meant for this guy and Jekyll botched it.
371	00:23:58	00:24:04	He knew the guy was gonna bleed out, so he tried to cover his mistake with a knife wound.
372	00:24:04	00:24:08	Why would he cover it up back then, and hand it to us on a platter now?
373	00:24:08	00:24:09	Jekyll's getting cocky, boys.
374	00:24:09	00:24:11	That's good for us.
375	00:24:27	00:24:31	Door's been open recently.
376	00:24:40	00:24:43	If you have a key to the place, you could come and go as you please.
377	00:24:44	00:24:47	Got blood.
378	00:24:49	00:24:52	But then again, this is where they prepared the food.
379	00:24:52	00:24:54	I'll test it.
380	00:25:35	00:25:37	Hey, Nick?
381	00:25:37	00:25:41	Yuri Grishenko.
382	00:25:41	00:25:45	He's with another man who appears in a lot of the pictures on the wall.
383	00:25:45	00:25:48	Sara, blood on the table's human.
384	00:25:48	00:25:51	We just found Jekyll's operating room.
385	00:25:53	00:25:55	We got the DNA back from the blood at the restaurant.
386	00:25:55	00:26:00	Joey Bigelow and the John Doe, who we now know as Yuri Grishenko.
387	00:26:00	00:26:07	He was a Ukranian businessman, made his fortune in gas and oil, spent his winters in Vegas gambling. No family.
388	00:26:09	00:26:13	When his body was recovered, his passport and wallet were gone.
389	00:26:15	00:26:19	No one reported him missing, and he fell through the cracks.
390	00:26:19	00:26:24	So how did Jekyll get Grishenko's John Doe number?
391	00:26:24	00:26:28	Probably called the Coroner's Office, used Ray's badge number to get the information.
392	00:26:28	00:26:31	You see that mark... on the leg?
393	00:26:31	00:26:34	That X is not a part of da Vinci's original drawing.
394	00:26:34	00:26:38	And a mark like that could imply surgical incision through the groin.
395	00:26:38	00:26:45	None of his previous victims had an injury there, so this could be a present or future victim.
396	00:26:45	00:26:46	Right.
397	00:26:46	00:26:52	I think that I... saw something like this in Herson's evidence box.
398	00:26:54	00:26:56	Like some sort of claw.
399	00:27:03	00:27:04	This is an IVC filter.
400	00:27:04	00:27:13	It's used to collect clotted blood in venous thrombosis patients, and it's inserted laparoscopically through the groin.
401	00:27:13	00:27:19	So this... is a drawing of an IVC filter.
402	00:27:19	00:27:21	All right.
403	00:27:21	00:27:24	NAYL.
404	00:27:24	00:27:29	No... There's... a partial horizontal break in the stem of the Y.
405	00:27:32	00:27:33	Navel?
406	00:27:33	00:27:35	Navel.
407	00:27:35	00:27:40	A pneumonic acronym taught to medical students to teach them how to locate the femoral artery.
408	00:27:40	00:27:44	Nerve, Artery, Vein, Lymphatic.
409	00:27:44	00:27:49	It's the order in which these anatomical structures are positioned in the leg.
410	00:27:49	00:27:52	So if he meant N-A-V-L, why did he use a Y?
411	00:27:52	00:27:54	Because he's a wordsmith.
412	00:27:54	00:27:58	He likes double entendres, even triple entendres.
413	00:27:58	00:28:12	The Y could represent the inferior vena cava, which is the large forking vein that carries blood from the lower half of the body up into the heart, which is typically where an IVC filter is placed.
414	00:28:12	00:28:20	Jekyll is telling us that in a while he is going to insert an IVC filter into the inferior vena cava of his next victim.
415	00:28:21	00:28:24	So what's that propeller for?
416	00:28:27	00:28:35	It looks... as if it was designed to fit perfectly inside the filter.
417	00:28:35	00:28:39	If this device was inserted into the inferior vena cava...
418	00:28:39	00:28:50	blood flow would cause the propeller to turn, which would cause the legs of the filter itself to expand out, pushing against the interior wall of the vein.
419	00:28:50	00:28:53	How long could someone survive with that thing inside them?
420	00:28:53	00:29:05	It's hard to say, but it would work very slowly, it would create excruciating pain, and eventually, the vein would burst from the pressure, and the victim would die.
421	00:29:21	00:29:22	Shut up!
422	00:29:22	00:29:25	Told you to shut the hell up. My God!
423	00:29:34	00:29:35	Uh, we're just about finished.
424	00:29:36	00:29:37	Just give me what you got.
425	00:29:37	00:29:39	Well, the meat is definitely not human; it's pork.
426	00:29:39	00:29:42	In fact, it's prosciutto di Parma.
427	00:29:42	00:29:53	Common prosciutto is cured with garlic and spices-- cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg-- but prosciutto di Parma is cured with sea salt and then larded and packed with cracked pepper, allowing for the superior flavor of the meat to come through.
428	00:29:53	00:29:57	So maybe Jekyll is moving up in the culinary world.
429	00:29:57	00:29:58	DNA?
430	00:29:59	00:30:01	Well, there's definitely no touch DNA-- that was negative.
431	00:30:01	00:30:03	But because it's prosciutto, that means it was dehydrated.
432	00:30:03	00:30:05	And not cooked. Right.
433	00:30:05	00:30:11	So we think it might still contain some embedded epithelial DNA, if Jekyll wasn't wearing gloves when he made the jerky in the first place.
434	00:30:22	00:30:28	How's it going? Oh, we've been cross-referencing employees from the old restaurant with people who are still in the industry.
435	00:30:28	00:30:35	Well, I can narrow down the list-- we're only interested in employees who are now working at high-end Italian restaurants. Well, we've got a handful of those.
436	00:30:37	00:30:38	Let's hit the streets.
437	00:30:56	00:30:59	There's a couple cars in the lot.
438	00:30:59	00:31:01	Somebody's here.
439	00:31:17	00:31:19	Excuse me, sir?
440	00:31:19	00:31:21	Sorry, fellas, kitchen's closed.
441	00:31:22	00:31:23	I'm Nick Stokes. This is Ray Langston.
442	00:31:23	00:31:25	We're with the crime lab.
443	00:31:25	00:31:28	We'd like to ask you a few questions, if you got a minute.
444	00:31:28	00:31:33	Hey... it's always an honor to help out the Las Vegas Police Department, the greatest in the world.
445	00:31:33	00:31:35	I'm Giovanni. Everybody calls me Papa. Thank you.
446	00:31:35	00:31:37	Have a seat. All right, thanks.
447	00:31:37	00:31:39	Papa...
448	00:31:39	00:31:43	did you used to work at a restaurant called Venetti's, on the north side of town?
449	00:31:43	00:31:44	I managed the place.
450	00:31:44	00:31:48	Worked my way up from dishwasher.
451	00:31:48	00:31:49	It was old-school, you know.
452	00:31:49	00:31:52	A red sauce joint, but...
453	00:31:52	00:31:55	a lot of great men-- important men-- ate there.
454	00:31:55	00:31:57	Do you manage this place?
455	00:31:57	00:31:58	Come on.
456	00:31:58	00:31:59	I own it.
457	00:31:59	00:32:01	DiMasa, that's me. Papa DiMasa.
458	00:32:01	00:32:03	Hey, how about a glass of wine?
459	00:32:03	00:32:07	Aw, that's very kind of you... Come on, come on, come on, who's gonna know?
460	00:32:07	00:32:08	A glass of wine's good for the heart.
461	00:32:08	00:32:10	Hey, Charlie, yo!
462	00:32:10	00:32:12	A good Barolo and three glasses.
463	00:32:12	00:32:17	We're looking for all the guys who used to work at Venetti's that work here now, you know what I mean?
464	00:32:17	00:32:18	Yeah. Oh...
465	00:32:18	00:32:20	so this is Charlie-- he's the cook.
466	00:32:20	00:32:21	Charlie.
467	00:32:21	00:32:23	Gentlemen.
468	00:32:23	00:32:25	Yeah, I brought a lot of the boys.
469	00:32:25	00:32:27	All good guys. (gasping breaths)
470	00:32:27	00:32:30	Are you all right?
471	00:32:30	00:32:31	Whew! (wry laugh) Being an owner.
472	00:32:32	00:32:33	Lot of stress.
473	00:32:33	00:32:37	Yeah, I'd like to take a look at your employee list, if you don't mind.
474	00:32:37	00:32:39	Yeah, sure.
475	00:32:39	00:32:40	Don't get up, Dad.
476	00:32:40	00:32:42	I'll get it.
477	00:32:44	00:32:48	How long have you been experiencing this pain, sir? I don't know, a day or two.
478	00:32:48	00:32:50	Aw, don't worry about me, I'm fine.
479	00:32:50	00:32:52	Do you have some kind of heart condition?
480	00:32:52	00:32:53	Me? Nah.
481	00:32:53	00:32:56	Come on... I got a heart like a lion, like all the DiMasa men.
482	00:32:58	00:32:59	I just... I just got to...
483	00:32:59	00:33:01	lay off the Bolognese sauce, you know?
484	00:33:02	00:33:04	Excuse me.
485	00:33:05	00:33:07	Stokes.
486	00:33:07	00:33:09	I just got the DNA results from the meat cards.
487	00:33:10	00:33:15	Whoever made the prosciutto is a filial match to the septic appendix we found in Bernard Higgins.
488	00:33:15	00:33:18	So that appendix either belonged to Jekyll's father or...
489	00:33:18	00:33:20	Or his son.
490	00:33:20	00:33:21	Thanks, Catherine.
491	00:33:21	00:33:25	Mr. DiMasa, did you recently have your appendix removed?
492	00:33:25	00:33:27	What are you, a mind reader?
493	00:33:27	00:33:30	Yeah. A couple of days before Thanksgiving.
494	00:33:30	00:33:33	Go back there and see what that guy's doing.
495	00:33:33	00:33:35	Get him out of here, Ray.
496	00:33:35	00:33:37	Mr. DiMasa, we're gonna take you to the hospital.
497	00:33:37	00:33:39	It's-It's okay. I'm-I'm a doctor.
498	00:33:39	00:33:41	Oh... my son wanted to be a doctor.
499	00:33:41	00:33:43	Yes... (gunshot blasts)
500	00:33:43	00:33:47	Come with me. This way, sir. STOKES Clark! Clark!
501	00:33:47	00:33:50	Situation! Clark!
502	00:34:23	00:34:25	Three-David-34, Control.
503	00:34:25	00:34:26	Officer Clark, respond.
504	00:34:33	00:34:35	Charlie-oh-three-Stokes, Control. Respond.
505	00:34:36	00:34:37	Control, Langston.
506	00:34:37	00:34:39	Shots fired. Two officers down.
507	00:34:39	00:34:43	Got here too early, Ray, but you're not gonna spoil my fun.
508	00:34:43	00:34:44	Repeat. Shots fired. Two officers down.
509	00:34:44	00:34:47	Armed suspect with a shotgun in the restaurant.
510	00:34:47	00:34:49	Sure. Call 'em all.
511	00:34:49	00:34:51	Nothing the old man likes better than an audience.
512	00:34:51	00:34:52	Isn't that so, Papa?!
513	00:34:52	00:34:55	What-What-What... What are you talking about?
514	00:34:55	00:34:56	What? Put your weapon down!
515	00:34:56	00:34:59	I don't want to have to shoot you!
516	00:34:59	00:35:00	What do I care?
517	00:35:00	00:35:05	I'm a cop killer twice over. I just want to see my father die.
518	00:35:05	00:35:07	You try and stop me, and I'll blow you away!
519	00:35:07	00:35:08	What, are you crazy?
520	00:35:08	00:35:10	Are you out of your mind?! (groans)
521	00:35:10	00:35:12	Mr. DiMasa-- slow, controlled, even breaths, please.
522	00:35:12	00:35:16	Don't you ever get tired of standing on your feet all day?
523	00:35:16	00:35:20	Man, I hear that's what they do to those guys down in Gitmo to make them talk.
524	00:35:20	00:35:22	I can sit down, if I want to.
525	00:35:22	00:35:24	Why don't you, man?
526	00:35:26	00:35:27	Maybe I don't want to.
527	00:35:27	00:35:31	Thing is, I could make you a hero, Barclay.
528	00:35:31	00:35:33	I...
529	00:35:33	00:35:34	guess I could make you famous.
530	00:35:34	00:35:37	I've been screwing with these other guys.
531	00:35:37	00:35:39	You know that, right?
532	00:35:39	00:35:43	But I could just give you the whole head of cabbage.
533	00:35:43	00:35:46	You must know people at Ely, right?
534	00:35:47	00:35:50	Maybe.
535	00:35:50	00:35:53	Mr. DiMasa, you have something implanted in your chest.
536	00:35:53	00:35:54	You have to remain calm.
537	00:35:56	00:35:59	I hope it's tearing you up like a thousand knives inside.
538	00:35:59	00:36:00	I did that to you, Papa.
539	00:36:03	00:36:06	That's the sound I want to hear.
540	00:36:06	00:36:09	Keep that strong DiMasa heart pumping, Papa.
541	00:36:09	00:36:12	It's a drumbeat right to the grave.
542	00:36:12	00:36:14	I wanted to be a doctor, Papa!
543	00:36:14	00:36:16	What stopped you, Charlie?
544	00:36:16	00:36:17	He did!
545	00:36:17	00:36:18	Look what I built.
546	00:36:18	00:36:21	For-For you, Charlie.
547	00:36:21	00:36:22	I never wanted it!
548	00:36:22	00:36:24	I could have been a great man.
549	00:36:24	00:36:25	A doctor, Papa.
550	00:36:26	00:36:27	But you had to wreck my life!
551	00:36:27	00:36:29	Do what a doctor would do.
552	00:36:29	00:36:30	Let him live.
553	00:36:30	00:36:33	I'm not asking for the world here, man. I...
554	00:36:33	00:36:36	It's just, my life there sucks.
555	00:36:36	00:36:44	All I want is an extra half hour in the yard, maybe some smokes once in a while, but... nothing illegal, man.
556	00:36:44	00:36:46	Screw you.
557	00:36:46	00:36:50	I know I got to give up Jekyll's name to somebody, while it's still worth something.
558	00:36:50	00:36:52	Might as well be you.
559	00:36:52	00:36:54	Barclay, I like you a lot, man.
560	00:36:54	00:36:56	You have a light finger on that button.
561	00:36:56	00:37:00	If it was me, I'd be mashing that thing just to watch me dance. I...
562	00:37:00	00:37:02	But you are good people, man.
563	00:37:02	00:37:06	00 news, right?
564	00:37:06	00:37:09	You'd be getting a medal on your chest.
565	00:37:09	00:37:10	I don't know.
566	00:37:10	00:37:12	Would it help you make detective, Barclay?
567	00:37:12	00:37:15	You'd strut around like those guys.
568	00:37:15	00:37:17	You could probably get laid, Barclay.
569	00:37:17	00:37:20	I mean, you'd probably get laid a lot.
570	00:37:20	00:37:23	Who is he?
571	00:37:23	00:37:25	Dr. Jekyll is your mother.
572	00:37:26	00:37:27	What?
573	00:37:27	00:37:30	And she banged every one of 'em before she killed them. (croaks)
574	00:37:41	00:37:42	Sergeant Barclay.
575	00:37:42	00:37:44	I need medical in the holding cells.
576	00:37:44	00:37:45	I got an inmate down.
577	00:37:45	00:37:49	Charlie, I understand you wanting to kill your old man, I do.
578	00:37:49	00:37:51	But why Higgins?
579	00:37:51	00:37:52	Why Herson? Why all the others?
580	00:37:52	00:37:55	You killed all those men, Charlie? You did that?!
581	00:37:55	00:37:58	Yeah... I killed your friends, Pop.
582	00:37:58	00:38:00	Your heroes.
583	00:38:00	00:38:03	Great men who were what I could never be.
584	00:38:03	00:38:04	Never good enough.
585	00:38:04	00:38:08	I got through three years of medical school, and then Mama died.
586	00:38:08	00:38:13	And you used that to suck me back in, didn't you, Papa?
587	00:38:13	00:38:14	I need, I needed you, Charlie.
588	00:38:14	00:38:16	To serve your heroes!
589	00:38:16	00:38:19	I should have been your hero!
590	00:38:19	00:38:20	I was lonely.
591	00:38:20	00:38:23	I-I... I needed you, Charlie.
592	00:38:23	00:38:25	Charlie, listen to me.
593	00:38:26	00:38:28	I wished my old man dead a thousand times over.
594	00:38:29	00:38:31	He was a drunk, you know? A real bad drunk.
595	00:38:31	00:38:33	One night, he'd been out fighting.
596	00:38:33	00:38:35	A neighbor brought him home, blind drunk.
597	00:38:36	00:38:40	Someone had beaten him so terribly, he had a bruise on his throat the size of a baseball.
598	00:38:40	00:38:45	I pulled him up on the porch and watched him try and catch his breath while he was gargling blood.
599	00:38:45	00:38:51	I was so tired of taking him to the emergency room, I just left him there.
600	00:38:51	00:38:53	Figured he'd sleep it off.
601	00:38:54	00:39:01	When I came down in the morning, he was laying in a patch of winter sunshine, and he was stone-cold dead where I left him.
602	00:39:01	00:39:02	How'd that make you feel?
603	00:39:04	00:39:07	Not the way you think it's gonna make you feel, Charlie.
604	00:39:07	00:39:10	I just want to see him die.
605	00:39:10	00:39:12	Shouldn't be much longer now.
606	00:39:12	00:39:14	Let me tell you something, Charlie.
607	00:39:14	00:39:18	Even when the old man dies, you're not gonna stop being his son.
608	00:39:18	00:39:20	You become the son of a ghost.
609	00:39:20	00:39:22	The pain doesn't go away.
610	00:39:22	00:39:23	The rage doesn't go away.
611	00:39:23	00:39:28	So, come on, put your gun down, walk out of here, be a man.
612	00:39:28	00:39:30	I will.
613	00:39:30	00:39:32	Soon as he's dead.
614	00:39:32	00:39:33	I can't let that happen, Charlie.
615	00:39:33	00:39:35	I'm going to stand up now.
616	00:39:37	00:39:40	I'm standing up, Charlie.
617	00:39:43	00:39:47	I'm going to walk into the back, get some ice.
618	00:39:47	00:39:49	Slow your father's heart rate.
619	00:40:15	00:40:20	Y'all better get out of here before there's a crime scene to investigate.
620	00:40:20	00:40:22	You scared the hell out of us, Nicky.
621	00:40:22	00:40:24	Ah... I'll be all right.
622	00:40:24	00:40:26	Papa DiMasa made it through surgery.
623	00:40:26	00:40:30	The doctors were able to remove the filter and stent the vein.
624	00:40:30	00:40:31	He's going to make it.
625	00:40:31	00:40:34	The Jekyll case is closed.
626	00:40:34	00:40:36	On to the next one, right?
627	00:40:36	00:40:39	Unfortunately, there's always a next one.
628	00:40:39	00:40:40	Mm.
629	00:40:40	00:40:41	I'll see you soon.
630	00:40:41	00:40:43	All right.
631	00:40:44	00:40:45	I'll be back to give you a lift home?
632	00:40:46	00:40:48	Oh, no way.
633	00:40:48	00:40:50	You're a terrible driver.
634	00:40:52	00:40:53	Ray?
635	00:40:54	00:40:56	Yeah?
636	00:40:57	00:41:03	That story you told about your father-- did you really just let him die like that?
637	00:41:03	00:41:06	I should have let the son of a bitch die, but...
638	00:41:06	00:41:09	I loved him.
639	00:41:09	00:41:14	I took a knife, I opened his trachea, saved his life.
640	00:41:15	00:41:17	Watched him die of lung cancer two years later.
641	00:41:21	00:41:24	Hey, you feel better.
642	00:41:24	00:41:26	I play dead good, don't I?
643	00:41:26	00:41:28	You should've been an actor.
644	00:41:30	00:41:32	Thanks, Cath.
645	00:41:32	00:41:34	Nick's going to be okay.
646	00:41:35	00:41:36	That's great.
647	00:41:37	00:41:39	Okay. Thanks.
648	00:41:39	00:41:40	How is he?
649	00:41:41	00:41:45	I'm assuming he's okay, because he wants us to bring him a pizza, or he's gonna kick our asses.
650	00:41:46	00:41:48	Do you want to come with us?
651	00:41:48	00:41:50	No, thanks.
652	00:41:51	00:41:55	Uh... just tell him I'm glad he's all right.
653	00:41:58	00:42:00	Jim.
654	00:42:00	00:42:02	Come on, I'll buy you a drink at PJ's.
655	00:42:02	00:42:04	Listen, uh, give me a minute.
656	00:42:04	00:42:06	I'll catch up to you.
657	00:42:11	00:42:14	Officer, give us a little room, will you?
658	00:42:14	00:42:16	Hello, Nate.
659	00:42:19	00:42:20	I came to tell you that...
660	00:42:20	00:42:23	You killed Jekyll.
661	00:42:23	00:42:27	All the urgency's gone out of your eyes, Doctor.
662	00:42:27	00:42:30	All the tension's out of your body.
663	00:42:30	00:42:33	You look like you came out of it relatively unscathed.
664	00:42:33	00:42:35	You know what they say, Whatever doesn't kill you...
665	00:42:35	00:42:38	I knew you and Charlie would get along.
666	00:42:38	00:42:41	Daddy issues.
667	00:42:41	00:42:50	And the irony is, Doctor, he didn't kill nearly as many people as he would've, if he'd followed his dream and become, you know, your average surgeon.
668	00:42:50	00:42:52	Am I right?
669	00:42:52	00:42:54	Good-bye, Nate.
