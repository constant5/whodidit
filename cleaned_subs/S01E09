5	00:00:29	00:00:34	Las Vegas Nine-Zero-Nine cleared for V-O-R Runway One-Five approach.
6	00:00:34	00:00:35	Over.
7	00:00:35	00:00:37	V-O-R Runway One-Five approach. Roger.
8	00:00:37	00:00:39	Request Las Vegas Police.
9	00:00:39	00:00:41	Understand-- police?
10	00:00:41	00:00:42	Roger.
11	00:00:42	00:00:43	Mommy!
12	00:00:56	00:00:58	Luggage stays in the plane.
13	00:00:58	00:01:02	We're going to treat this like a crime scene until we're told otherwise.
14	00:01:02	00:01:04	Tim, Sam, talk to the coach passengers.
15	00:01:04	00:01:05	See what you can't learn.
16	00:01:05	00:01:09	All right, look I'm going to talk to the first class passengers that are in the lounge.
17	00:01:09	00:01:11	Let's meet back there in a half an hour, all right?
18	00:01:15	00:01:18	So... dead guy in first class?
19	00:01:18	00:01:20	Las Vegas Air.
20	00:01:20	00:01:23	Always heard it was a good time.
21	00:01:32	00:01:34	Coroner pronounce?
22	00:01:34	00:01:35	About 30 minutes ago.
23	00:01:36	00:01:37	Eyewitnesses?
24	00:01:37	00:01:41	Everyone in the first class-- Nine passengers, one flight attendant.
25	00:01:41	00:01:43	Where are they now? Sequestered in the lounge.
26	00:01:43	00:01:49	According to the flight crew, the deceased had some sort of panic attack and died before they landed.
27	00:01:55	00:01:59	cockpit door.
28	00:01:59	00:02:01	Bloody handprint.
29	00:02:04	00:02:07	Looks like foot impression.
30	00:02:07	00:02:09	Ballpark shoe size...
31	00:02:09	00:02:11	ten to 11.
32	00:02:21	00:02:24	Deceased found lying between rows one and two.
33	00:02:38	00:02:40	What is that, blood?
34	00:02:42	00:02:44	I want this whole plane taped off...
35	00:02:44	00:02:46	nose to tail and wing to wing.
36	00:02:46	00:02:48	Oh, it's going to take a lot of tape.
37	00:02:48	00:02:51	I've got a dead body, a crime scene with wings.
38	00:02:51	00:02:54	Something very wrong happened in this plane.
39	00:03:46	00:03:47	Sheriff?
40	00:03:47	00:03:51	We've got a whale of an opportunity here, Gil.
41	00:03:51	00:03:54	Dead body on an airplane-- F.A.A. has jurisdiction.
42	00:03:54	00:03:56	But the feds won't be here till sunrise.
43	00:03:56	00:03:59	That gives us about 12 hours to be heroes.
44	00:03:59	00:04:00	I don't follow you.
45	00:04:00	00:04:08	Well, we either hand over the guy who did it when the feds get here or we give them all the glory while we watch from the sidelines.
46	00:04:08	00:04:10	I don't even know if we have a homicide yet.
47	00:04:10	00:04:12	First reports indicate...
48	00:04:12	00:04:14	he had some kind of an episode.
49	00:04:14	00:04:15	Give me a little credit.
50	00:04:15	00:04:19	Even you wouldn't tape off one of these wide-bodies unless you knew you had something.
51	00:04:19	00:04:21	Arrest would be good for you.
52	00:04:21	00:04:24	It would be good for me too, good for Las Vegas.
53	00:04:24	00:04:27	You running for mayor?
54	00:04:32	00:04:34	What about the passengers in coach?
55	00:04:34	00:04:36	Did they see anything?
56	00:04:36	00:04:38	Brass said the curtain was shut.
57	00:04:38	00:04:41	Flight attendant kept them separated. They disembarked through the rear.
58	00:04:41	00:04:43	What do we know about the dead guy?
59	00:04:43	00:04:45	Tony Candlewell, age 30.
60	00:04:45	00:04:49	Communications company manager from Atlanta, married...
61	00:04:49	00:04:51	no record.
62	00:04:53	00:04:55	So?
63	00:04:55	00:04:56	What do you think?
64	00:04:56	00:04:58	I don't know...
65	00:04:58	00:05:00	but this sure must have looked scary at 30,000 feet.
66	00:05:00	00:05:03	All this done by one guy?
67	00:05:03	00:05:04	Had to be on drugs.
68	00:05:04	00:05:07	Too much damage for one guy.
69	00:05:07	00:05:10	So, more than one guy? What do you think, Gris?
70	00:05:10	00:05:14	I think we've got ten witnesses all singing the same song.
71	00:05:14	00:05:15	The deceased went berserk.
72	00:05:15	00:05:19	Unless we find something else in the evidence, that's what happened.
73	00:05:19	00:05:21	Catherine.
74	00:05:21	00:05:22	I'll start the interviews. Thank you.
75	00:05:22	00:05:24	Warrick, go with.
76	00:05:24	00:05:26	Brass has them all assembled in the lounge.
77	00:05:26	00:05:27	Assume evidence on everyone.
78	00:05:28	00:05:31	Nick, go with the coroner. Sara and I will work the plane.
79	00:05:31	00:05:32	This is a mobile crime scene.
80	00:05:32	00:05:34	It might not be here tomorrow.
81	00:05:45	00:05:47	Miss, my daughter has to go to the bathroom.
82	00:05:47	00:05:49	Okay. I'll see what I can do.
83	00:05:49	00:05:52	Thank you.
84	00:05:52	00:05:54	How are you holding up?
85	00:05:54	00:05:56	I'm still shaking.
86	00:06:09	00:06:10	Could I have your attention?
87	00:06:10	00:06:11	I'm Jim Brass from Homicide.
88	00:06:11	00:06:14	This is Catherine Willows and Warrick Brown from Las Vegas Criminalistics.
89	00:06:14	00:06:16	They're here to gather evidence.
90	00:06:16	00:06:18	You know you can't keep us here.
91	00:06:18	00:06:21	Sir, we realize this is an imposition, and we apologize for it.
92	00:06:21	00:06:23	Nobody wants to see you on your way more than we do.
93	00:06:23	00:06:26	We'll make this as quick and painless as we possibly can.
94	00:06:27	00:06:29	Okay.
95	00:06:29	00:06:31	Nice snow job.
96	00:06:31	00:06:33	More flies with honey.
97	00:06:37	00:06:39	Driver's license...
98	00:06:39	00:06:42	library card...
99	00:06:42	00:06:43	organ donor card.
100	00:06:43	00:06:45	Stand-up guy.
101	00:06:47	00:06:48	He had a family.
102	00:06:48	00:06:50	Can you imagine getting that phone call?
103	00:06:50	00:06:53	What a shame.
104	00:06:53	00:06:55	David...
105	00:06:55	00:06:57	It's always a shame.
106	00:07:01	00:07:03	I saw him board.
107	00:07:03	00:07:05	He seemed like an okay guy.
108	00:07:05	00:07:07	Here, let me help you with that.
109	00:07:07	00:07:08	Oh, thank you.
110	00:07:10	00:07:11	Thank you very much.
111	00:07:11	00:07:13	Sure, no problem.
112	00:07:13	00:07:17	When did you become aware that there was a problem in the cabin?
113	00:07:17	00:07:19	1630 hours, about 35 minutes out.
114	00:07:19	00:07:22	Shannon asked one of us to come out and address an issue with a passenger.
115	00:07:22	00:07:24	What's the problem, Shannon?
116	00:07:25	00:07:26	Hello.
117	00:07:26	00:07:30	Go back to coach. Make sure no one comes forward.
118	00:07:30	00:07:31	Thanks.
119	00:07:32	00:07:34	Come on, it's been ten minutes! Sir...
120	00:07:34	00:07:35	is there some way we can assist you?
121	00:07:35	00:07:37	You can help me open this door.
122	00:07:37	00:07:40	There are two other restrooms towards the rear of the plane.
123	00:07:40	00:07:44	I paid $1,200 to pee here, not in coach.
124	00:07:44	00:07:45	Sir? You need to take your seat.
125	00:07:46	00:07:47	How much time did you spend with him?
126	00:07:47	00:07:49	Two minutes.
127	00:07:49	00:07:54	In that time did you notice anything that would explain his behavior?
128	00:07:54	00:07:56	Was he drunk maybe, or on drugs?
129	00:07:56	00:07:57	Not as far as I could tell.
130	00:07:57	00:07:59	A little agitated.
131	00:07:59	00:08:02	It's not like I haven't seen this kind of behavior before.
132	00:08:02	00:08:05	Flying just makes people react in funny ways.
133	00:08:11	00:08:13	Is that a meat thermometer?
134	00:08:14	00:08:17	Digital readout. Bigger numbers.
135	00:08:19	00:08:21	98.1.
136	00:08:21	00:08:24	Guy should be colder than that.
137	00:08:24	00:08:29	Body temperature drops two degrees in the first hour after death then one and a half degrees for each successive hour.
138	00:08:29	00:08:32	Well, he's been dead for two hours.
139	00:08:32	00:08:35	That would make his temperature at the time of death...
140	00:08:35	00:08:36	101.6.
141	00:08:36	00:08:39	This guy had a fever.
142	00:08:39	00:08:43	Let's see what else we've got.
143	00:08:43	00:08:47	Petecchial hemorrhaging behind the eyes...
144	00:08:47	00:08:50	suggesting suffocation of some sort.
145	00:08:50	00:08:53	Horseshoe-shaped contusion on the left side of the neck.
146	00:08:53	00:08:55	Looks like the heel of a boot.
147	00:08:55	00:08:58	Oh, I'll buy that-- for now.
148	00:09:00	00:09:02	Multiple contusions front and back.
149	00:09:02	00:09:04	Broken hand.
150	00:09:04	00:09:07	Well, this guy's a study in contradictions.
151	00:09:08	00:09:14	He's got defensive wounds on his palms but the scrapes on his knuckles and the broken hand indicate aggression.
152	00:09:24	00:09:27	Dr. Kiera Behrle, 3E.
153	00:09:27	00:09:29	Emily Behrle, 3F.
154	00:09:31	00:09:33	Nate Metz, 2C.
155	00:09:37	00:09:39	Nate Metz.
156	00:09:39	00:09:42	Put your seat back and tray table in their upright position.
157	00:09:42	00:09:44	I don't think so.
158	00:09:44	00:09:46	Let me guess who was sitting in 3C.
159	00:09:46	00:09:48	Tony Candlewell.
160	00:09:48	00:09:50	The dead guy.
161	00:09:50	00:09:52	Look, the guy was a real ass.
162	00:09:52	00:09:54	In what way?
163	00:09:54	00:09:57	Look, you know why I fly first class?
164	00:09:57	00:09:59	Other than the fact that my company pays for it?
165	00:09:59	00:10:01	Because I can work. I have to work.
166	00:10:01	00:10:04	And he wouldn't let you?
167	00:10:04	00:10:07	No, he, he, he kept kicking the back of my seat with his foot.
168	00:10:07	00:10:10	You know, like in a movie theater when somebody's kicking your seat?
169	00:10:10	00:10:12	Imagine that all the way from Atlanta to Las Vegas.
170	00:10:12	00:10:16	Are you telling me this guy was kicking the back of your seat the entire flight?
171	00:10:16	00:10:18	Maybe not the entire flight.
172	00:10:18	00:10:20	You know, like, like Dallas to, to Las Vegas.
173	00:10:25	00:10:29	Hey, Pele, could you please stop kicking the back of my seat?
174	00:10:29	00:10:30	I wasn't doing anything.
175	00:10:30	00:10:34	You know exactly what you're doing. Stop it.
176	00:10:35	00:10:36	What did you do?
177	00:10:36	00:10:38	I ju... I ignored him.
178	00:10:38	00:10:44	You know, I punched the seat a couple times in anger and that's it.
179	00:10:44	00:10:46	Look, the guy set me off.
180	00:10:46	00:10:48	It was either the seat or him.
181	00:10:49	00:10:51	May I see your hands?
182	00:10:55	00:10:57	Your knuckles are pretty banged up.
183	00:11:07	00:11:09	Blood drops...
184	00:11:12	00:11:14	away from the main event.
185	00:11:14	00:11:16	Maybe that's where the action started.
186	00:11:17	00:11:19	Could just be a bloody nose.
187	00:11:24	00:11:27	Who was sitting in 4B?
188	00:11:30	00:11:32	Lou Everett.
189	00:11:38	00:11:40	Lou Everett?
190	00:11:41	00:11:45	Yeah. How'd you get that slice around the chops?
191	00:11:45	00:11:47	The guy swung at me with a C.D.
192	00:11:47	00:11:50	Put his finger in the hole and slashed me.
193	00:11:50	00:11:52	What guy?
194	00:11:52	00:11:53	That crazy guy, the psycho.
195	00:11:54	00:11:55	He was out of his mind.
196	00:11:57	00:12:00	What the hell is wrong with you?
197	00:12:00	00:12:03	You know, you owe me another laptop, pal. ( mumbles )
198	00:12:03	00:12:04	Hey, hey.
199	00:12:04	00:12:05	We're in mid- flight now, guys.
200	00:12:06	00:12:06	That's enough.
201	00:12:12	00:12:14	So what do you think?
202	00:12:14	00:12:17	Bodily injury... can I sue a dead man?
203	00:12:17	00:12:19	I think you need some coffee.
204	00:12:19	00:12:20	What do you mean?
205	00:12:20	00:12:22	A few cocktails on the plane, Lou?
206	00:12:22	00:12:25	Look, I get nervous when I fly, so what?
207	00:12:25	00:12:30	Well, alcohol does different things to different people... at different altitudes.
208	00:12:30	00:12:31	Hey, I was fine.
209	00:12:31	00:12:33	He went bananas.
210	00:12:33	00:12:36	Why don't you just ask... ask the flight attendant?
211	00:12:36	00:12:38	So, we were about 35 minutes out...
212	00:12:38	00:12:41	when he started pressing his call button over and over.
213	00:12:41	00:12:42	He was complaining of a headache.
214	00:12:42	00:12:44	And did you give him anything?
215	00:12:44	00:12:48	Yeah, I gave him a packet of aspirin and he popped it dry, no water.
216	00:12:48	00:12:50	And, as far as you know...
217	00:12:50	00:12:52	did he complain of a headache when he boarded?
218	00:12:52	00:12:54	No.
219	00:12:54	00:12:56	So what made the worm turn?
220	00:12:56	00:12:58	Look, I've been flying for ten years.
221	00:12:58	00:13:00	You know, I have seen it all.
222	00:13:00	00:13:03	I've seen ferrets in suitcases, uh, fellatio in first class...
223	00:13:03	00:13:06	passengers stir-frying on their tray tables.
224	00:13:06	00:13:08	I mean...
225	00:13:08	00:13:10	Who knows why anyone does anything?
226	00:13:10	00:13:12	Right.
227	00:13:12	00:13:13	Well, thanks for your time.
228	00:13:13	00:13:15	Thank you.
229	00:13:15	00:13:16	Thanks.
230	00:13:23	00:13:25	So, any bites?
231	00:13:25	00:13:27	Nada. You?
232	00:13:27	00:13:29	If nothing criminal happened on that flight...
233	00:13:29	00:13:31	why isn't anybody talking to us?
234	00:13:31	00:13:33	I'm going to go out on a limb here...
235	00:13:33	00:13:36	and say... they're hiding something?
236	00:13:36	00:13:38	Then we get to play hide-and-seek.
237	00:13:53	00:13:55	I just got off the phone with Nick.
238	00:13:55	00:13:58	The coroner did some carving on our dead guy.
239	00:13:58	00:14:02	He found intercranial bleeding, thoracic hemorrhaging a ruptured spleen.
240	00:14:02	00:14:05	And for what it's worth the guy also had a fever.
241	00:14:06	00:14:08	Did you find anything interesting?
242	00:14:08	00:14:12	Well, the guy in 4B was knocking them back pretty good.
243	00:14:36	00:14:38	Could be dried blood.
244	00:14:41	00:14:45	Victim had defensive wounds on his hand.
245	00:14:46	00:14:49	Marlene Valdez was sitting in 2E.
246	00:14:49	00:14:50	Look at me.
247	00:14:50	00:14:51	my blouse is ruined.
248	00:14:51	00:14:52	Just hope it washes out.
249	00:14:52	00:14:53	We'll get you a new one.
250	00:14:53	00:14:58	After I saved Mr. Valdez was your life in danger?
251	00:14:58	00:14:59	Well, you know...
252	00:14:59	00:15:01	Of course his life was in danger.
253	00:15:01	00:15:05	That maniac was pacing up and down the aisles.
254	00:15:05	00:15:06	All sweating.
255	00:15:06	00:15:07	His eyes were glazed.
256	00:15:07	00:15:10	I was sure he was going to hijack that plane.
257	00:15:10	00:15:11	Everyone needs to return to their seats.
258	00:15:13	00:15:14	Do something.
259	00:15:14	00:15:16	No, we should just mind our own business.
260	00:15:16	00:15:18	Well, if you don't do something, I will.
261	00:15:18	00:15:21	Uh... Ex-excuse me, sir.
262	00:15:21	00:15:23	Uh... why don't you just take a seat?
263	00:15:27	00:15:31	The other half of the wine bottle... from 2E.
264	00:15:33	00:15:37	So... Marlene in 2E slashes the victim.
265	00:15:37	00:15:39	He's bleeding...
266	00:15:39	00:15:40	where does he go?
267	00:15:40	00:15:42	The lavatory.
268	00:15:54	00:15:55	No evidence.
269	00:15:55	00:15:57	No.
270	00:15:57	00:15:58	No patent evidence.
271	00:15:58	00:16:01	But if there's blood present there maybe latent evidence.
272	00:16:04	00:16:06	One step ahead of you, every so often.
273	00:16:06	00:16:07	Thank you.
274	00:16:17	00:16:19	Well.
275	00:16:21	00:16:25	Would you hand me the Christopher Columbus from my field kit?
276	00:16:30	00:16:31	Thank you.
277	00:16:42	00:16:44	I take it that's not blood.
278	00:16:44	00:16:46	No... but there's protein in it.
279	00:16:46	00:16:49	Oh, the mile-high club.
280	00:16:49	00:16:53	That means the two passengers may have had no idea what was going on inside that cabin.
281	00:16:53	00:16:57	You know, high altitude enhances the entire sexual experience.
282	00:16:57	00:17:00	It increases the euphoria.
283	00:17:00	00:17:01	Well... it's good.
284	00:17:01	00:17:03	I don't know if it's that good.
285	00:17:04	00:17:07	Cite your source.
286	00:17:07	00:17:08	Hand me a swab, please.
287	00:17:08	00:17:11	You're avoiding the question.
288	00:17:11	00:17:12	Enhances sexual experience.
289	00:17:12	00:17:13	Increases euphoria.
290	00:17:13	00:17:15	Cite your source.
291	00:17:15	00:17:17	A magazine.
292	00:17:17	00:17:18	What magazine?
293	00:17:18	00:17:22	Applied Psychodynamics in Forensic Science.
294	00:17:22	00:17:23	Never heard of it.
295	00:17:23	00:17:25	I'll get you a subscription.
296	00:17:25	00:17:26	Now, cite your source.
297	00:17:26	00:17:28	Oh... now you want to go down that route?
298	00:17:28	00:17:29	Yeah.
299	00:17:29	00:17:32	Nah. Never mind.
300	00:17:32	00:17:33	You started it.
301	00:17:36	00:17:42	Delta Airlines, Flight 1109, Boston to Miami March '93, Ken Fuller.
302	00:17:42	00:17:46	Hazel eyes organic chem lab TABMOC...
303	00:17:47	00:17:48	overrated... in...
304	00:17:48	00:17:50	every aspect.
305	00:17:51	00:17:53	Could... we... get back to work, please?
306	00:17:53	00:17:55	Yeah.
307	00:17:55	00:17:57	I think your, uh...
308	00:17:57	00:18:02	firsthand knowledge and experience in airplane bathrooms you should do the swab.
309	00:18:05	00:18:08	Fine.
310	00:18:08	00:18:10	And where were you when this was all going on, Mrs. Finn?
311	00:18:10	00:18:12	Uh, Mercer, Vicky Mercer.
312	00:18:12	00:18:14	Um, I was in the bathroom.
313	00:18:14	00:18:15	In the bathroom?
314	00:18:15	00:18:17	For how long?
315	00:18:17	00:18:18	For a while.
316	00:18:18	00:18:20	I... I really don't fly very well.
317	00:18:21	00:18:23	We're not married.
318	00:18:23	00:18:25	We just work together.
319	00:18:25	00:18:27	Right.
320	00:18:27	00:18:28	Where were you?
321	00:18:28	00:18:31	I was in my seat. So, then you saw what happened?
322	00:18:31	00:18:33	I had my headphones on.
323	00:18:33	00:18:37	I was listening to the air traffic control channel.
324	00:18:37	00:18:38	Puts me right out.
325	00:18:39	00:18:45	So, you... slept through everything and you woke up next to a... dead body.
326	00:18:47	00:18:49	Basically, yeah.
327	00:19:11	00:19:13	Handprints.
328	00:19:13	00:19:16	A stallion.
329	00:19:16	00:19:22	All right, we're going to have to change tact here because what I said about getting more flies with honey-- I was wrong.
330	00:19:23	00:19:24	This is incredible.
331	00:19:24	00:19:27	Ten people and no one's talking.
332	00:19:29	00:19:33	the killer is in the group and the rest of them are afraid.
333	00:19:41	00:19:44	That guy was wearing khakis, right?
334	00:19:44	00:19:46	Yeah.
335	00:19:54	00:19:56	Fibers drawn from his pants maybe?
336	00:19:56	00:19:58	We get anything else off the clothes?
337	00:19:58	00:20:00	Nick's working on it.
338	00:20:07	00:20:08	What have you got?
339	00:20:08	00:20:14	Well... what you've got here is a nice Bordeaux and a Starbuck's blend.
340	00:20:14	00:20:17	No blood. No saliva.
341	00:20:18	00:20:19	What about prints?
342	00:20:19	00:20:21	Uh, well, suede leather's a tough gig.
343	00:20:21	00:20:23	It's too porous.
344	00:20:23	00:20:24	Hey.
345	00:20:27	00:20:30	Are you losing your touch there, Einstein?
346	00:20:30	00:20:33	Coroner's photos of the dead guy's back.
347	00:20:33	00:20:36	Multiple horseshoe-shaped bruises.
348	00:20:36	00:20:39	Those are definitely shoeprints.
349	00:20:39	00:20:42	Yeah, looks like somebody stomped on your dead guy.
350	00:20:42	00:20:43	Hmm.
351	00:20:43	00:20:44	Bring me the jacket.
352	00:20:44	00:20:48	If I do heel impressions I'll need something to compare it to.
353	00:20:48	00:20:49	See you in 20.
354	00:20:55	00:20:57	I need their shoes.
355	00:20:57	00:20:59	Why you telling me?
356	00:20:59	00:21:02	Because you're the people person, right?
357	00:21:02	00:21:03	Well, why don't you tell them that?
358	00:21:03	00:21:07	They're not giving me bupkes.
359	00:21:07	00:21:09	( crunching ) Please?
360	00:21:19	00:21:21	Okay, people.
361	00:21:21	00:21:22	Listen up.
362	00:21:22	00:21:23	Shoes.
363	00:21:23	00:21:24	Off.
364	00:21:36	00:21:37	Now.
365	00:21:58	00:22:00	It all comes down to shoeprints.
366	00:22:02	00:22:03	Hey.
367	00:22:03	00:22:04	Hi.
368	00:22:04	00:22:06	Looks like a shoe sale.
369	00:22:06	00:22:10	Uh, Nick sent these photo comparisons over from the lab. Oh.
370	00:22:12	00:22:15	Excellent.
371	00:22:18	00:22:19	Max.
372	00:22:26	00:22:28	That a fit?
373	00:22:28	00:22:29	Yeah...
374	00:22:40	00:22:43	Well, that's it then.
375	00:22:47	00:22:48	Okay, folks.
376	00:22:48	00:22:51	I've got some good news... and I've got some bad news.
377	00:22:51	00:22:52	The good news?
378	00:22:52	00:22:56	Well, the good news would be that seven of you may be...
379	00:22:56	00:22:57	getting out of here very soon.
380	00:22:57	00:22:59	What's the bad news?
381	00:22:59	00:23:04	The bad news is that three of you may be staying in Vegas a lot longer than you planned.
382	00:23:04	00:23:18	And that would be... Mr. Lou Everett Mr. Max Valdez and Dr. Kiera Behrle.
383	00:23:20	00:23:21	Would you...
384	00:23:21	00:23:23	please come with me.
385	00:23:36	00:23:40	Stevie, keep these guys on ice.
386	00:23:48	00:23:49	I'm sorry, ma'am.
387	00:23:50	00:23:54	This is as far as your daughter can go but we'll have an officer stay with her.
388	00:23:54	00:23:56	Come on. It's been a rough night.
389	00:23:56	00:24:03	Dr. Behrle, we're going to be asking you some very sensitive questions-- questions that I know that I wouldn't want my daughter to hear.
390	00:24:03	00:24:04	Hi.
391	00:24:04	00:24:06	My name is Jim.
392	00:24:06	00:24:07	What's your name?
393	00:24:07	00:24:08	Emily.
394	00:24:08	00:24:09	Emily. Oh, that's a great name.
395	00:24:09	00:24:12	Emily, I'm going to make you a deal, okay?
396	00:24:12	00:24:16	We're going to borrow your mom for a little while.
397	00:24:16	00:24:18	I'll be right back, sweetie, okay?
398	00:24:18	00:24:19	Okay.
399	00:24:19	00:24:22	Okay? And here's the good part.
400	00:24:22	00:24:25	You get to borrow anything you see on me.
401	00:24:25	00:24:27	Can I borrow your gun?
402	00:24:27	00:24:29	Well, you know, my gun...
403	00:24:29	00:24:30	it's kind of...
404	00:24:30	00:24:32	it's old, and it's heavy and...
405	00:24:32	00:24:33	and it's stuck there.
406	00:24:33	00:24:35	Anything else?
407	00:24:35	00:24:37	How about your badge?
408	00:24:37	00:24:39	You got a deal, and you know what?
409	00:24:39	00:24:40	This is the best thing.
410	00:24:40	00:24:42	You know why?
411	00:24:42	00:24:45	Because anyone gives you any trouble all you got to do is...
412	00:24:45	00:24:46	flash this.
413	00:24:46	00:24:48	There you go.
414	00:24:52	00:24:53	So, were you scared?
415	00:24:55	00:24:57	Did you see what happened?
416	00:25:00	00:25:02	Okay. Okay.
417	00:25:02	00:25:05	It's okay.
418	00:25:08	00:25:11	Sweet kid-- Emily.
419	00:25:11	00:25:14	Uh, so, Dr. Behrle...
420	00:25:14	00:25:16	how long have you been a physician?
421	00:25:16	00:25:18	I prefer surgeon.
422	00:25:18	00:25:20	Mm, okay.
423	00:25:20	00:25:22	I've been practicing for 11 years.
424	00:25:22	00:25:24	And what was the nature of your visit to, uh...
425	00:25:24	00:25:25	to Las Vegas?
426	00:25:25	00:25:28	Emily. She wanted to see the white tigers.
427	00:25:28	00:25:31	How did you get that black eye?
428	00:25:31	00:25:33	I caught it during the ruckus.
429	00:25:33	00:25:36	The price you pay for being a Good Samaritan.
430	00:25:36	00:25:40	Okay.
431	00:25:40	00:25:44	I'm, uh... just a little confused.
432	00:25:44	00:25:51	Your heel impressions were found on the back of the victim's suede jacket.
433	00:25:51	00:25:55	That's a little aggressive for a Good Samaritan.
434	00:25:57	00:25:58	No! No!
435	00:25:58	00:25:59	Hey, stop it!
436	00:25:59	00:26:00	Oh...
437	00:26:01	00:26:02	Get out of the way.
438	00:26:02	00:26:03	Get out of the way!
439	00:26:03	00:26:05	Give him some air. Sir?
440	00:26:07	00:26:10	One, two three...
441	00:26:14	00:26:16	One, two...
442	00:26:16	00:26:24	If he had been in my ER I might have been able to save him but at 30,000 feet, there's only so much you can do.
443	00:26:24	00:26:26	Look...
444	00:26:26	00:26:28	I did what I could.
445	00:26:28	00:26:30	And you're satisfied with that?
446	00:26:30	00:26:31	Why?
447	00:26:31	00:26:36	Because I'm a doctor I'm responsible for what happened on that plane?
448	00:26:36	00:26:37	What did happen?
449	00:26:37	00:26:42	I protected my daughter and I tried to save a guy's life.
450	00:26:42	00:26:45	And yes, I'm satisfied with that.
451	00:26:45	00:26:49	Well, you've seen Cops the TV show, so you know our game.
452	00:26:49	00:26:52	The first one to talk gets to make a deal.
453	00:26:52	00:26:54	I don't need a deal.
454	00:26:54	00:26:55	No?
455	00:26:55	00:26:59	Well, maybe your daughter Emily needs you to take one.
456	00:27:04	00:27:05	Mm-hmm.
457	00:27:05	00:27:08	Right.
458	00:27:08	00:27:10	Makes sense.
459	00:27:10	00:27:11	Okay.
460	00:27:11	00:27:15	Thanks, Catherine.
461	00:27:15	00:27:17	We have a ping-pong ball.
462	00:27:17	00:27:20	We just need to find the paddles.
463	00:27:23	00:27:24	Where are they?
464	00:27:24	00:27:26	Probably in the first compartment.
465	00:27:27	00:27:32	The doctor in 3E told Catherine that she performed CPR on the victim.
466	00:27:32	00:27:33	Check the inside of the paddles.
467	00:27:33	00:27:35	See if there's any bio gel on them.
468	00:27:43	00:27:46	These look like they weren't even used.
469	00:27:46	00:27:48	There was more lubricant in the bathroom.
470	00:27:48	00:27:50	It's pretty negligent for a doctor.
471	00:27:50	00:27:54	She's got to know every commercial airline carries defib paddles.
472	00:27:54	00:27:56	Yeah, and if she didn't know, the flight attendant sure did.
473	00:27:56	00:28:00	By the time I thought to grab the defibrillator he was already dead.
474	00:28:00	00:28:06	But you are trained to use the paddles in the event of an emergency and this was an emergency situation.
475	00:28:06	00:28:12	Yes, but I'm trained to use them when a man is having cardiac arrest in his seat not flopping around in the aisle.
476	00:28:12	00:28:17	So, whatever it was he was going through it didn't look a heart attack.
477	00:28:17	00:28:19	Look, I'm going to be honest with you.
478	00:28:19	00:28:21	I was scared.
479	00:28:21	00:28:23	I mean...
480	00:28:23	00:28:25	I thought this guy was going to take us all down.
481	00:28:26	00:28:29	All right, everyone needs to return to their seats.
482	00:28:29	00:28:31	I've got to get off!
483	00:28:32	00:28:33	I have to land this plane!
484	00:28:33	00:28:36	All right, so let me get this straight.
485	00:28:36	00:28:37	2F is on the floor.
486	00:28:37	00:28:40	His wife is in the aisle brandishing a broken wine bottle.
487	00:28:40	00:28:41	What about 1A?
488	00:28:41	00:28:43	He was closest to the action.
489	00:28:43	00:28:45	That would be Mr. Cash.
490	00:28:45	00:28:47	Um, he was in his seat.
491	00:28:47	00:28:48	Mr. Cash.
492	00:28:48	00:28:54	I was wondering when you guys were going to get around to asking me some questions.
493	00:28:54	00:28:56	So, what did you see?
494	00:28:56	00:28:58	Not much.
495	00:28:58	00:29:02	Sir, it's been a long night, and we don't have much time before our crime scene flies away.
496	00:29:02	00:29:03	I was in my seat.
497	00:29:03	00:29:05	You were sitting in 1A.
498	00:29:06	00:29:07	You were sitting ringside.
499	00:29:07	00:29:08	How do you not see what happened?
500	00:29:13	00:29:15	The blind leading the blind.
501	00:29:15	00:29:16	I'm not totally blind.
502	00:29:16	00:29:18	I'm legally blind.
503	00:29:18	00:29:21	My central visual acuity is 20/200.
504	00:29:25	00:29:26	The plane has to land!
505	00:29:26	00:29:28	We've got to get off this plane!
506	00:29:28	00:29:30	Get him off the door!
507	00:29:30	00:29:33	No, no, no!
508	00:29:33	00:29:35	Can you identify the voices?
509	00:29:36	00:29:37	First voice.
510	00:29:37	00:29:38	4B.
511	00:29:38	00:29:41	Businessman. I could tell by the way he ordered drinks.
512	00:29:41	00:29:42	How do you mean?
513	00:29:42	00:29:44	JW Black, triple not double.
514	00:29:44	00:29:49	Second voice, guy in 2F, kind of far away.
515	00:29:49	00:29:50	Max.
516	00:29:50	00:29:52	Third voice?
517	00:29:52	00:29:55	Third voice, row behind me, two seats over.
518	00:29:55	00:29:57	Mr. Dot-com.
519	00:29:57	00:30:00	Guy must've typed 60 words a minute.
520	00:30:01	00:30:02	Mr. Cash, you've got to help me.
521	00:30:02	00:30:05	I've got eight eyewitnesses with various stories.
522	00:30:05	00:30:12	I put them all in a mixing bowl, add eggs, milk stick it in the oven, and all I got is a limp souffle.
523	00:30:12	00:30:17	We need you to tell us everything you heard.
524	00:30:17	00:30:22	From the time the deceased banged on the cockpit door to the time he died.
525	00:30:22	00:30:24	Then listen up.
526	00:30:24	00:30:26	We need to get off this plane!
527	00:30:26	00:30:27	I have to get off this plane!
528	00:30:27	00:30:28	Get him off the door.
529	00:30:29	00:30:31	Get out of the way. Get out of the way.
530	00:30:33	00:30:34	No!
531	00:30:48	00:30:50	I never heard such silence.
532	00:30:57	00:31:00	I got two hours till I lose my crime scene to the feds.
533	00:31:00	00:31:02	Tell me you have something.
534	00:31:02	00:31:03	I know what set this guy off.
535	00:31:03	00:31:05	That's more than I got.
536	00:31:05	00:31:07	We know our victim suffered from intercranial bleeding.
537	00:31:07	00:31:13	I had that pegged as possible cause of death so I crack his skull open, and what do I find?
538	00:31:13	00:31:17	A cantaloupe in a soup can.
539	00:31:17	00:31:18	Tight fit.
540	00:31:18	00:31:20	And not from one or two blows to the head.
541	00:31:21	00:31:24	He was also running a high fever so I tested his spinal fluid.
542	00:31:24	00:31:28	A normal protein level is between 15 and 45 milligrams.
543	00:31:28	00:31:30	Candlewell's was 60.
544	00:31:32	00:31:34	Did anybody mention this guy had a headache?
545	00:31:34	00:31:38	Flight attendant gave him two aspirin. Why?
546	00:31:38	00:31:43	He was suffering from undiagnosed encephalitis.
547	00:31:43	00:31:44	Swelling of the brain.
548	00:31:44	00:31:49	slurred speech delirium, loss of consciousness.
549	00:31:49	00:31:56	You throw in the altitude and the air pressure changes in the cabin and our guy was probably out of his mind.
550	00:31:56	00:31:59	Is that what killed him-- encephalitis?
551	00:31:59	00:32:01	It wasn't the one thing that killed him.
552	00:32:01	00:32:05	Ruptured spleen, intercranial bleeding petecchial hemorrhaging.
553	00:32:06	00:32:09	And the guy's heart just stopped beating.
554	00:32:09	00:32:11	A, B, C, D or all of the above.
555	00:32:11	00:32:18	Standoff with the police-- guy gets shot in the chest runs back into his burning house inhaling smoke as he goes.
556	00:32:18	00:32:22	The roof collapses the air conditioning unit falls on his head, he dies.
557	00:32:22	00:32:24	What killed him?
558	00:32:43	00:32:47	Okay, Vicki Mercer and Carl Finn I believe are in the bathroom.
559	00:32:47	00:32:49	Mile-High Club.
560	00:32:49	00:32:52	If you ask me, it's their spouses that are the dummies.
561	00:32:52	00:32:56	Emily Behrle is in 3F.
562	00:32:56	00:32:58	Preston Cash, 1A.
563	00:32:58	00:33:01	Tony Candlewell, dead guy.
564	00:33:01	00:33:02	Right there, 3C.
565	00:33:02	00:33:05	And for now, he's alive until he's dead.
566	00:33:05	00:33:08	So, you want to tell us what we're doing here?
567	00:33:08	00:33:16	The physical evidence that Sarah, Nick, and I collected is contradicting the anecdotal statements that you, Catherine, and Warrick got and my money's on the physical evidence.
568	00:33:16	00:33:17	So is mine.
569	00:33:17	00:33:18	These passengers are lying.
570	00:33:18	00:33:24	I mean, if this was an arson case, we'd burn down an empty house to prove our theory, right?
571	00:33:24	00:33:28	Well, in this case we're going to recreate the flight from... 1630 hours on.
572	00:33:29	00:33:31	You are in 4B.
573	00:33:31	00:33:32	Lou.
574	00:33:32	00:33:34	Lou, the angry businessman.
575	00:33:34	00:33:35	How about that?
576	00:33:35	00:33:36	I want to be Shannon.
577	00:33:36	00:33:38	Good.
578	00:33:38	00:33:39	The stewardess.
579	00:33:39	00:33:41	Excuse me, it's flight attendant.
580	00:33:41	00:33:43	Catherine-- the doctor, 3E.
581	00:33:43	00:33:44	Single mom.
582	00:33:44	00:33:46	What an imagination you have.
583	00:33:46	00:33:48	Max and Marlene, 2E and F.
584	00:33:48	00:33:49	You two are married.
585	00:33:49	00:33:51	Who wants to wear the pants?
586	00:33:51	00:33:53	CSI-3 seniority, sweetie.
587	00:33:53	00:33:55	Yeah, whatever.
588	00:33:55	00:33:56	You're henpecked anyway.
589	00:33:56	00:33:59	Let me guess-- you're the computer geek.
590	00:33:59	00:34:01	In the interest of clarity, yes.
591	00:34:02	00:34:04	Nate in 2C.
592	00:34:07	00:34:10	Okay, look, it's going to be sunrise in ten minutes.
593	00:34:10	00:34:13	We're going to have to do a Run, Lola, Run and play this in literal time.
594	00:34:13	00:34:25	Up until the point that Captain Murdle escorted the dead guy back to his seat the events are substantiated by the flight log and the eyewitness statements unless anybody knows something different.
595	00:34:25	00:34:26	What time was that?
596	00:34:26	00:34:31	1632 hours-- exactly 33 minutes before they landed in Vegas.
597	00:34:31	00:34:33	One minute later, the plane hit turbulence.
598	00:34:33	00:34:37	And according to the flight attendant that's when our stiff lost it and started hammering his call button.
599	00:34:38	00:34:42	So, I walk over try to calm the guy down, but he won't quit.
600	00:34:42	00:34:45	Well, we know he's suffering from encephalitis.
601	00:34:45	00:34:48	He's probably sweating and fighting back a migraine.
602	00:34:48	00:34:51	I know what my guy's doing in my seat-- Lou.
603	00:34:51	00:34:52	He's getting ticked off.
604	00:34:52	00:34:56	Yeah, but Candlewell is ticking off Nate in 2C even worse.
605	00:34:56	00:34:59	I mean, this guy is perseverating.
606	00:35:04	00:35:06	That's when he winds up and breaks your seat.
607	00:35:06	00:35:09	So, I get up, spin around confront the guy.
608	00:35:09	00:35:12	Now, Lou in 4B said he was the peacemaker.
609	00:35:12	00:35:13	Peacemaker, my ass.
610	00:35:13	00:35:16	He's got three empties in the pouch.
611	00:35:16	00:35:18	Seat reeks of whiskey.
612	00:35:18	00:35:21	The guy probably spilled Lou's drink.
613	00:35:21	00:35:23	Very good.
614	00:35:23	00:35:24	I was boss at CSI once.
615	00:35:24	00:35:25	For a reason.
616	00:35:26	00:35:27	Anyway, Lou gets up.
617	00:35:27	00:35:28	He's angry.
618	00:35:28	00:35:29	He takes a swipe at the guy.
619	00:35:29	00:35:33	After knocking a few back at 33,000 feet you know, probably misses.
620	00:35:33	00:35:35	And what does he get for his trouble?
621	00:35:37	00:35:39	A CD swipe across the chops.
622	00:35:39	00:35:42	So, he falls back, and maybe spilled his own drink.
623	00:35:42	00:35:45	This time Candlewell's got to be out of his seat, right?
624	00:35:45	00:35:47	If I'm Max, I want no part of this.
625	00:35:47	00:35:49	Plus I don't have an aisle seat.
626	00:35:49	00:35:52	Yeah, but your wife is going to make sure that you get in the playing field.
627	00:35:52	00:35:55	Yeah, go ahead, honey. Save my life.
628	00:35:55	00:35:59	Right. Max gets up slides across Marlene.
629	00:35:59	00:36:00	Excuse me, Buttercup.
630	00:36:00	00:36:03	Candlewell's moving up and down the aisle by now.
631	00:36:03	00:36:06	I come over confront the dead guy.
632	00:36:06	00:36:08	Then what?
633	00:36:08	00:36:09	Who talked to 2F?
634	00:36:10	00:36:11	I did.
635	00:36:11	00:36:13	Max told the dead guy to sit down.
636	00:36:13	00:36:18	He turned, he shoved Max into the food cart Max landed on the ground.
637	00:36:18	00:36:24	Warrick-- I mean, Marlene-- that's when you got up and grabbed the broken wine neck.
638	00:36:24	00:36:26	Saved Nick's butt as usual.
639	00:36:26	00:36:27	Bottle of wine on the floor.
640	00:36:27	00:36:33	You slash at Candlewell then he swipes him across the hand-- hence the defensive wound.
641	00:36:33	00:36:34	Now, our guy's bleeding.
642	00:36:34	00:36:36	He turns and heads for the cockpit.
643	00:36:38	00:36:41	Bang-- he wants in the cockpit but the door is locked.
644	00:36:41	00:36:45	Captain Murdle gets on the horn calls First Class twice.
645	00:36:45	00:36:47	No answer. Why?
646	00:36:47	00:36:49	Shannon's vapor-locked.
647	00:36:49	00:36:51	He can't get in the cockpit.
648	00:36:51	00:36:52	What's next?
649	00:36:52	00:36:53	He heads for the exit door.
650	00:36:53	00:36:57	Blood underneath the latch handle shows that Candlewell tried to open it.
651	00:36:57	00:36:59	Candlewell gets the door open, they all die.
652	00:36:59	00:37:01	Now it's a whole new ball game.
653	00:37:01	00:37:03	It's every man for himself.
654	00:37:03	00:37:04	Oh, yeah.
655	00:37:04	00:37:07	This is where they all get scared.
656	00:37:07	00:37:12	And according to Preston, Max, and Lou they got to Candlewell first.
657	00:37:12	00:37:13	The struggle ensued.
658	00:37:13	00:37:20	Max and Lou slammed into Preston and at some point Candlewell goes down.
659	00:37:20	00:37:21	Now it's a free-for-all.
660	00:37:21	00:37:22	'Cause my shoes end up on his back.
661	00:37:22	00:37:24	Mine too. Ditto.
662	00:37:24	00:37:26	He's messing with me; I get my licks in.
663	00:37:26	00:37:28	Nate's knuckles were bruised...
664	00:37:28	00:37:29	he's in on it.
665	00:37:30	00:37:31	We're in close quarters so there's elbows flying everywhere.
666	00:37:32	00:37:34	That's probably how the doctor got her black eye.
667	00:37:34	00:37:36	Right. Hey, guys!
668	00:37:36	00:37:40	If you jump a guy at the exit he dies at the exit.
669	00:37:44	00:37:46	Yeah.
670	00:37:48	00:37:51	And our guy...
671	00:37:51	00:37:53	was found five feet away...
672	00:37:53	00:37:56	with his head towards coach.
673	00:37:56	00:37:58	He tried to get away.
674	00:37:58	00:38:00	But they didn't let him.
675	00:38:00	00:38:04	And at this point we aren't individuals anymore; we're a mob.
676	00:38:10	00:38:11	Mommy!
677	00:38:18	00:38:21	You can't perform CPR on a man's back.
678	00:38:21	00:38:24	Dr. Burley had to have rolled him over.
679	00:38:24	00:38:27	Probably just to cover for ourselves.
680	00:38:27	00:38:31	That makes us all murderers.
681	00:38:43	00:38:46	I want five of those passengers arrested for murder.
682	00:38:46	00:38:49	That's four more than I anticipated.
683	00:38:49	00:38:52	We looked at the evidence, and the evidence says five.
684	00:38:52	00:38:53	Let me get this straight.
685	00:38:53	00:38:56	Five strangers get on a plane and then together, they kill a man.
686	00:38:56	00:38:58	On the surface, self-defense.
687	00:38:58	00:39:00	They thought Candlewell was bringing the plane down.
688	00:39:01	00:39:03	And he would've.
689	00:39:03	00:39:04	But he didn't.
690	00:39:04	00:39:08	They stopped him, and then they killed him not as individuals, but as a mob.
691	00:39:08	00:39:10	Let's cut to the chase, Gil.
692	00:39:10	00:39:11	Can you prove your case?
693	00:39:12	00:39:13	Not yet. I need more time.
694	00:39:13	00:39:15	Yeah, well, time's up.
695	00:39:18	00:39:20	I'm going to give these people their walking papers.
696	00:39:20	00:39:22	If the Feds want to pursue it, let them.
697	00:39:22	00:39:23	Oh, come on. Don't do that.
698	00:39:24	00:39:25	No jury's going to ever convict them.
699	00:39:25	00:39:26	You don't know that, Brian.
700	00:39:26	00:39:31	Look, if you or I were on that plane we would do whatever it takes to save our lives.
701	00:39:31	00:39:33	That's what a jury would say.
702	00:39:33	00:39:35	That's not what the evidence says.
703	00:39:35	00:39:38	Exactly my point.
704	00:40:27	00:40:34	Las Vegas Air has issued no formal comment other than to stand by the actions taken by the flight crew.
705	00:40:34	00:40:40	Meanwhile, the first-class passengers from the flight have been released and no charges will be filed.
706	00:40:40	00:40:44	The airline provided a bus to their Las Vegas destinations.
707	00:40:44	00:40:50	Our request for interviews were denied, leaving the events surrounding the death of Tony Candlewell a mystery.
708	00:40:50	00:40:51	Hey.
709	00:40:51	00:40:52	Whoa.
710	00:40:52	00:40:53	Let it go, guys.
711	00:40:53	00:40:58	Those people should be going to jail not some hotel on the Strip.
712	00:40:58	00:40:59	It's out of our hands.
713	00:40:59	00:41:02	Our field ruling was overturned by the good old Sheriff and the Feds.
714	00:41:03	00:41:04	And you're okay with that?
715	00:41:04	00:41:13	We processed evidence for 12 hours laid out the whole case and now those passengers are going to suck martinis and eat shrimp cocktails?
716	00:41:13	00:41:14	Where's the justice?
717	00:41:15	00:41:16	Oh, you think this is about justice?
718	00:41:17	00:41:18	Yeah, what else?
719	00:41:18	00:41:21	It's about human nature how people react when their lives are threatened.
720	00:41:21	00:41:24	I know you're not condoning what they did.
721	00:41:24	00:41:25	I'm not discounting it.
722	00:41:25	00:41:32	I mean, think about it-- is there any place more vulnerable than being at 30,000 feet in a tin can?
723	00:41:32	00:41:38	Feeling vulnerable is not a defense and where they were is irrelevant.
724	00:41:38	00:41:39	They took a life.
725	00:41:39	00:41:41	Because their lives were threatened.
726	00:41:42	00:41:52	Their lives were threatened when Candlewell was at the emergency exit trying to open it, but the five feet between the exit and the aisles is what made the difference between self-defense and murder.
727	00:41:52	00:41:54	Human nature again.
728	00:41:54	00:41:56	I mean, adrenaline doesn't come with an off switch.
729	00:41:56	00:41:58	I don't care what you say.
730	00:41:58	00:42:00	I could never take a life.
731	00:42:00	00:42:05	If it was between him or me, I could.
732	00:42:06	00:42:07	Nick?
733	00:42:07	00:42:09	I don't know.
734	00:42:09	00:42:12	Well... it's wicked serious in here.
735	00:42:12	00:42:15	Yeah, well, we were just talking about murder and whether we would commit it.
736	00:42:15	00:42:17	I couldn't, Warrick could and Nick's on the fence.
737	00:42:17	00:42:19	We're taking an exit poll.
738	00:42:19	00:42:21	Catherine, you're a mother.
739	00:42:21	00:42:24	You have Lindsey, you're on that plane. How far do you go?
740	00:42:24	00:42:26	All the way.
741	00:42:26	00:42:28	That's right. ! You didn't even hesitate.
742	00:42:28	00:42:32	If it involves the protection of my child I fight to the death.
743	00:42:32	00:42:35	See? We have four people here, all with different opinions.
744	00:42:36	00:42:39	Think of how the passengers must have felt.
745	00:42:40	00:42:42	What do you think, Grissom?
746	00:42:43	00:42:46	I can't answer that question.
747	00:42:46	00:42:48	That's a cop-out. It's a simple question.
748	00:42:48	00:42:51	What would you have done if you had been one of those passengers?
749	00:42:51	00:42:53	It's not about that.
750	00:42:53	00:42:57	You all have different opinions but you've taken the same point of view.
751	00:42:57	00:43:02	You put yourself in the shoes of the passengers but nobody's put themselves in the shoes of the victim.
752	00:43:02	00:43:04	I'm sorry. What are you saying?
753	00:43:04	00:43:07	Nobody stopped to ask Candlewell if he was all right.
754	00:43:07	00:43:21	They just assumed because he was kicking the back of Nate's seat that he was a jerk because he was pushing his call button that he was bothering the flight attendant because he was trying to get into the lavatory he was making a scene, because he was going back and forth up and down the aisles, he was posing a threat.
755	00:43:21	00:43:23	He was a threat.
756	00:43:23	00:43:25	No. He turned into a threat.
757	00:43:25	00:43:26	It didn't have to be that way.
758	00:43:26	00:43:27	People make assumptions.
759	00:43:28	00:43:29	That's the problem. You just did.
760	00:43:29	00:43:37	And I think these passengers made the wrong assumption and now this guy's dead.
761	00:43:37	00:43:40	Well, if that's your stance how could it have been prevented?
762	00:43:40	00:43:51	If just one person had stopped and taken the time to look at the guy to listen to him, to figure out what was wrong with him it might not have happened.
763	00:43:51	00:43:53	It took five people to kill him.
764	00:43:53	00:43:56	It would've only taken one person to save his life.
