0	00:01:00	00:01:01	That's enough!
1	00:01:09	00:01:10	Come on, Laroi. He's okay!
2	00:01:10	00:01:11	We're going to dry it up, Laroi.
3	00:01:11	00:01:13	We're going to dry it up. Take it, Paul.
4	00:01:13	00:01:14	I got that.
5	00:01:20	00:01:21	Suck it up. Suck it up, son.
6	00:01:21	00:01:22	Suck it up, son.
7	00:01:22	00:01:23	Lo teine donde deseas!
8	00:01:23	00:01:25	Â¿Me entiendes lo que te digo?
9	00:01:25	00:01:26	El cuerpo... siempre moviendo...
10	00:01:26	00:01:27	Laroi, listen to me!
11	00:01:27	00:01:29	You keep your hands up, hear?
12	00:01:29	00:01:30	He's killing you with that left.
13	00:01:31	00:01:32	Bum don't got the heart to put me down.
14	00:01:33	00:01:37	Yeah, well, you better start throwing your hands, hook to the body hook to the head, upper cut.
15	00:01:37	00:01:38	Like we worked it in the gym.
16	00:02:48	00:02:49	One!
17	00:02:49	00:02:51	Two!
18	00:02:51	00:02:52	Three!
19	00:02:59	00:03:02	Laroi!
20	00:03:02	00:03:04	Laroi, talk to me!
21	00:03:04	00:03:05	Come on, Laroi!
22	00:03:05	00:03:07	Come on, baby, talk to me.
23	00:03:07	00:03:09	Laroi! Come on, get the doctor! Step it!
24	00:03:16	00:03:19	Laroi, The Fists of Steele.
25	00:03:19	00:03:21	WFB welterweight champion.
26	00:03:21	00:03:23	19 wins.
27	00:03:23	00:03:24	One loss.
28	00:03:24	00:03:26	Boxers have died in the ring before.
29	00:03:26	00:03:27	Why is this one a crime?
30	00:03:27	00:03:29	Casino management got a heads-up from the sports book.
31	00:03:29	00:03:35	Five hours before the opening bell Steele goes from a two-to-one favorite to a five-to-one underdog. Fight fixing?
32	00:03:35	00:03:37	Yeah.
33	00:03:37	00:03:38	That's a felony.
34	00:03:38	00:03:42	And if death occurs during commission of a felony, that's a murder.
35	00:03:58	00:04:00	Gang member.
36	00:04:00	00:04:02	Tenth Street Vandals.
37	00:04:02	00:04:06	Isolated incident or they having a war?
38	00:04:06	00:04:07	It's hard to tell.
39	00:04:07	00:04:08	Vandals are based in L.A.
40	00:04:08	00:04:10	but on a weekend like this...
41	00:04:10	00:04:13	brings knuckleheads in from all over. Witnesses?
42	00:04:13	00:04:15	They were all in the bathroom.
43	00:04:15	00:04:18	Aren't they always?
44	00:04:23	00:04:25	We are just trying to be reasonable here.
45	00:04:25	00:04:28	I am not giving this back unless I get my ring.
46	00:04:28	00:04:31	Mrs. Ramsey, it is not our policy to allow clients to...
47	00:04:31	00:04:33	Oh, really? I guess you need a new policy, don't you?
48	00:04:33	00:04:34	Now you are being unreasonable.
49	00:04:34	00:04:35	Now you...
50	00:04:41	00:04:42	Smash and grab.
51	00:04:42	00:04:44	Left that behind.
52	00:04:44	00:04:45	How many guys?
53	00:04:45	00:04:46	One.
54	00:04:46	00:04:47	Yeah.
55	00:04:47	00:04:50	Waited till the manager was alone knocked her down and hopped the counter.
56	00:04:50	00:04:52	Got away with a whole sack full of stones.
57	00:04:52	00:04:54	It takes some stones to pull off a job like this.
58	00:04:55	00:04:56	Good evening, gentlemen. What have we got?
59	00:04:56	00:04:58	Well, you and I have got a dead boxer.
60	00:04:58	00:05:00	Nick, you're going to get to run this solo.
61	00:05:00	00:05:02	Yeah? Yeah.
62	00:05:02	00:05:04	We're tapped out.
63	00:05:04	00:05:05	Welcome to fight night.
64	00:05:42	00:05:44	Okay. What are we looking for?
65	00:05:44	00:05:48	Blinding agents in the Vaseline stimulants in the water...
66	00:05:48	00:05:49	So...
67	00:05:50	00:05:51	basically, everything goes to tox.
68	00:05:52	00:05:53	Yeah.
69	00:05:53	00:05:54	Nice sport.
70	00:05:54	00:05:56	Well, it's only dirty if you make it dirty.
71	00:05:56	00:05:57	You know, boxing's about discipline.
72	00:05:57	00:06:01	It's two guys beating their brains out in a race for early-onset Parkinson's.
73	00:06:01	00:06:04	No, no, you know, it's mind and body.
74	00:06:04	00:06:05	Mind and body.
75	00:06:05	00:06:09	If you train one and not the other you're half a person.
76	00:06:11	00:06:13	What'd you find?
77	00:06:13	00:06:14	Saliva.
78	00:06:14	00:06:16	Oh, the spit bucket.
79	00:06:19	00:06:20	What's so funny?
80	00:06:20	00:06:22	Smiling, uh, represses the gag reflex.
81	00:06:22	00:06:27	This is coming from the same woman who processed fecal fat from a ruptured colon.
82	00:06:27	00:06:29	Every crim's got at least one problem area.
83	00:06:29	00:06:31	Mine's saliva.
84	00:06:31	00:06:33	Want me to get that for you? No, no.
85	00:06:33	00:06:35	You're sure.
86	00:06:35	00:06:38	Mind and body, right?
87	00:06:42	00:06:44	Everybody knew they hated each other.
88	00:06:44	00:06:45	They fought two times before.
89	00:06:45	00:06:47	Title wasn't even on the line tonight.
90	00:06:47	00:06:49	Just pride.
91	00:06:49	00:06:50	How'd the other fights go down?
92	00:06:50	00:06:52	I didn't get to ref them, but I saw them...
93	00:06:52	00:06:54	$39.95 a pop.
94	00:06:54	00:06:58	Damn pay-per-view's just like stealing, but they were good fights.
95	00:06:58	00:06:59	Laroi won both of them.
96	00:06:59	00:07:03	First one was a knockout in the eighth off this sweet right hook.
97	00:07:03	00:07:05	The other was a...
98	00:07:05	00:07:07	a TKO in the tenth, yeah.
99	00:07:07	00:07:10	Uh, he really dropped the hammer on Molina that time.
100	00:07:10	00:07:13	Well, evidently, Molina hammered back tonight.
101	00:07:13	00:07:16	Two previous wins by knockout...
102	00:07:16	00:07:18	tonight, he dies.
103	00:07:18	00:07:20	What's up with that?
104	00:07:20	00:07:21	What do you mean?
105	00:07:21	00:07:24	Did you notice anything out of the ordinary about either fighter?
106	00:07:24	00:07:26	Slowed reactions, unusual strength?
107	00:07:28	00:07:31	All I noticed is that boy took one hell of a beating.
108	00:07:56	00:07:59	I got a gun.
109	00:07:59	00:08:01	Make that two.
110	00:08:26	00:08:30	Put up a couple of booths we could have ourselves a gun show out here.
111	00:08:30	00:08:31	Disposable firearms.
112	00:08:31	00:08:37	They know we can't link them to the weapons if we can't find the weapons on them.
113	00:08:37	00:08:39	Smith &amp;amp; Wesson .40. High end.
114	00:08:39	00:08:43	They're stealing their way to better guns.
115	00:08:43	00:08:46	And bringing them to Vegas for target practice.
116	00:08:47	00:08:48	Great.
117	00:09:06	00:09:09	That's everything he got.
118	00:09:10	00:09:12	What's it highlighted for?
119	00:09:12	00:09:13	It's a Riviera necklace.
120	00:09:13	00:09:19	We loaned it to a couple for the fight and they refuse to return it until we return the ring that they brought in for cleaning.
121	00:09:19	00:09:22	Which was stolen along with the other items, right?
122	00:09:22	00:09:26	Exactly-- and they won't leave until we get this sorted out.
123	00:09:26	00:09:27	Can you help me out here?
124	00:09:27	00:09:30	Sorry, mediation's not really my thing.
125	00:09:30	00:09:31	Thanks.
126	00:09:31	00:09:33	Mm-hmm.
127	00:09:35	00:09:37	O'Riley?
128	00:09:37	00:09:40	Stokes, listen, I'm at a smash and grab.
129	00:09:40	00:09:42	Lots of glass, a little blood.
130	00:09:42	00:09:44	Check the local hospitals.
131	00:09:44	00:09:48	Anyone comes in with a forearm laceration, it could be our guy.
132	00:09:48	00:09:50	Thanks, man.
133	00:09:53	00:09:56	I promoted this match, Mr. Grissom.
134	00:09:56	00:10:13	I spent 16 months of my life stroking fighters, managers, handlers, and kissing a whole lot of ass that never got past junior high and I resent the implication that the fight was fixed, or that Laroi Steele's death was anything other than a tragedy.
135	00:10:13	00:10:15	These photographs are from...?
136	00:10:15	00:10:17	The last Steele-Molina fight.
137	00:10:17	00:10:19	What, does he use them for motivation?
138	00:10:19	00:10:20	And for show.
139	00:10:20	00:10:21	Boxing is theater.
140	00:10:21	00:10:25	Well, according to your poster, this fight was about revenge.
141	00:10:25	00:10:27	Boxers fight for money.
142	00:10:27	00:10:28	The rest of it is just hype.
143	00:10:29	00:10:32	These Mr. Molina's?
144	00:10:32	00:10:33	Yeah.
145	00:10:33	00:10:34	From tonight's fight?
146	00:10:35	00:10:35	Yeah.
147	00:10:36	00:10:40	Technically, after a fight those gloves become property of the Boxing Commission.
148	00:10:40	00:10:42	Right now, they're evidence, so they belong to me.
149	00:10:42	00:10:45	What do you think you're going to find on those gloves-- liniment?
150	00:10:45	00:10:48	Like Sonny Liston used to blind Cassius Clay?
151	00:10:48	00:10:51	The sport has come a long way since then.
152	00:10:51	00:10:53	It's still two skulls and four fists.
153	00:10:54	00:10:55	It hasn't come that far.
154	00:10:58	00:11:01	What did you find?
155	00:11:01	00:11:07	What appears to be mercury.
156	00:11:07	00:11:09	Like in a thermometer?
157	00:11:09	00:11:12	Amongst other things.
158	00:11:18	00:11:20	Looks like it was fight night for a lot of people.
159	00:11:20	00:11:21	It sure does.
160	00:11:21	00:11:25	And some guys get paid a million bucks for it.
161	00:11:25	00:11:29	Sorry to keep you waiting, but, uh, Commission rules, you know?
162	00:11:29	00:11:31	Before and after a fight.
163	00:11:31	00:11:34	Boxing and drugs don't mix, you know?
164	00:11:38	00:11:41	All yours.
165	00:11:43	00:11:45	So... Â¿que onda?
166	00:11:45	00:11:49	What's the crime lab want with me?
167	00:11:49	00:11:52	Well, for starters, we need to see your hands.
168	00:11:52	00:11:53	Why?
169	00:11:53	00:11:55	Is that a no?
170	00:11:55	00:11:58	No.
171	00:12:02	00:12:04	One more.
172	00:12:08	00:12:12	Now, who do you think you're looking at-- Felix Trinidad?
173	00:12:13	00:12:15	Who is that?
174	00:12:15	00:12:21	Felix Trinidad is a fighter who was once accused of dipping his wraps in ice water before a fight.
175	00:12:21	00:12:24	It turns the tape and gauze into a hardened cast.
176	00:12:24	00:12:26	It's like punching with concrete.
177	00:12:26	00:12:29	And it also shreds your hands.
178	00:12:29	00:12:30	Mine are clean.
179	00:12:30	00:12:32	A fighter's lost his life.
180	00:12:32	00:12:36	We're just making sure that there was no unfair advantage.
181	00:12:36	00:12:38	All I did was out-punch Laroi.
182	00:12:38	00:12:41	Okay, you think I wanted it to go down like this?
183	00:12:41	00:12:46	I mean, people are going to remember me now like Ray Mancini when he killed that Korean guy.
184	00:12:46	00:12:47	That's my legacy now.
185	00:12:50	00:12:52	Ah, this wasn't my fault, all right?
186	00:12:52	00:12:57	He brought it upon himself talking all that trash saying I could never beat him.
187	00:12:57	00:12:59	Look...
188	00:12:59	00:13:02	he should have never came out in the seventh round.
189	00:13:02	00:13:04	He could barely stand up.
190	00:13:04	00:13:06	I knew it was over right then.
191	00:13:06	00:13:08	So why did you keep hitting him?
192	00:13:08	00:13:13	Because real fighters don't stop hitting until somebody makes them, all right?
193	00:13:13	00:13:16	When you're in the ring, your life's in the ref's hands.
194	00:13:23	00:13:26	Now, one word from that ref, and I would have stopped.
195	00:13:29	00:13:30	But he never gave the word.
196	00:13:43	00:13:45	How we doing, Bobby?
197	00:13:45	00:13:46	Hey. Well, good news.
198	00:13:46	00:13:50	All the bullets pulled from the vic are from the same gun.
199	00:13:50	00:13:52	Six right, .380.
200	00:13:52	00:13:53	The bad news?
201	00:13:53	00:13:56	We're 0 for two matching the bullets to the guns y'all recovered.
202	00:13:56	00:14:01	I did find something, though on one of them shells, if you want to take a look.
203	00:14:01	00:14:03	It's set up for you over there.
204	00:14:05	00:14:07	Could be biological.
205	00:14:07	00:14:09	I'll send it to trace.
206	00:14:09	00:14:13	Well, I hope it gets you somewhere 'cause all we got here is strike three.
207	00:14:13	00:14:15	Brass, Brown.
208	00:14:15	00:14:18	I need as much information as you can give me on a referee.
209	00:14:18	00:14:19	Hey, Sara.
210	00:14:20	00:14:21	Hey.
211	00:14:22	00:14:23	I'll be right there.
212	00:14:23	00:14:26	I have something to show you.
213	00:14:27	00:14:29	We gave Molina a ride in.
214	00:14:29	00:14:30	You did?
215	00:14:30	00:14:33	He didn't say much which is no big surprise, considering.
216	00:14:33	00:14:35	There's not much in here but, uh, I know how you like to see everything.
217	00:14:36	00:14:37	Thanks.
218	00:14:39	00:14:45	We checked vitals, cleaned his lacerations and he wanted his hand wraps cut off, so we cut them off.
219	00:14:45	00:14:47	Is this it?
220	00:14:47	00:14:48	Right.
221	00:14:52	00:14:54	He autographed it.
222	00:14:54	00:14:56	Nah, that's the inspector's signature.
223	00:14:56	00:14:57	Whoever watched him wrap up.
224	00:14:57	00:15:00	It looks like there's some kind of metal in the gauze.
225	00:15:02	00:15:03	Mercury, maybe?
226	00:15:04	00:15:06	No, there's no mercury in any of our instruments.
227	00:15:07	00:15:08	We're fully digital.
228	00:15:08	00:15:09	How do you think it got there?
229	00:15:10	00:15:11	I don't know.
230	00:15:11	00:15:14	Massive soft tissue damage, severe facial fractures.
231	00:15:14	00:15:19	Are they letting guys go at each other with clubs these days?
232	00:15:19	00:15:20	Only on cable.
233	00:15:20	00:15:26	It never ceases to amaze me the damage one human being can inflict on another.
234	00:15:26	00:15:28	Or how much damage a human body can sustain.
235	00:15:29	00:15:32	A heavyweight can land a punch at 1,000 pounds per square inch.
236	00:15:32	00:15:41	The energy of the punch is transferred through the cerebrospinal fluid compressing the brain against the skull temporarily disrupting neural activity.
237	00:15:41	00:15:42	Like a short circuit.
238	00:15:42	00:15:45	Too many short circuits and the brain shuts down.
239	00:15:45	00:15:47	And hence, a knockout.
240	00:15:47	00:15:51	This guy should have been so lucky.
241	00:15:51	00:15:55	This, uh, bruising under the chin seems heavy.
242	00:15:55	00:15:56	Yeah, I thought so, too.
243	00:15:56	00:15:57	I did a postmortem angiogram.
244	00:15:59	00:16:06	It's a basilar subarachnoid hematoma the result of a massive vertical blunt force trauma to the chin.
245	00:16:06	00:16:13	The sudden forced rotation of the neck tears the vertebral artery and blood pours out into the surrounding soft tissue.
246	00:16:14	00:16:16	It's called an uppercut.
247	00:16:18	00:16:20	and I say cause of death.
248	00:16:20	00:16:24	Gil, I never had you pegged as a fight fan.
249	00:16:24	00:16:25	I'm not, really.
250	00:16:25	00:16:31	My first year as a criminalist I thought boxing would be a good place to observe live blood spatter.
251	00:16:31	00:16:32	So, I went to a couple of bouts.
252	00:16:33	00:16:34	There wasn't much spatter.
253	00:16:34	00:16:37	Some interesting bruise formations, though.
254	00:16:37	00:16:40	So, uh, this is a socially acceptable live-subject laboratory for you?
255	00:16:40	00:16:43	Yeah. Not in this case.
256	00:16:45	00:16:48	Thank you.
257	00:16:48	00:16:49	Preliminary tox?
258	00:16:49	00:16:50	Yeah.
259	00:16:53	00:16:54	Professional athlete.
260	00:16:54	00:16:58	Would have expected performance enhancers-- uh, creatine, dianobol.
261	00:16:58	00:17:01	This man had sufentanil in his system.
262	00:17:01	00:17:03	Sufentanil? A sedative?
263	00:17:03	00:17:05	Yeah.
264	00:17:05	00:17:07	So, if the fighter won't take a dive...
265	00:17:09	00:17:11	help him take a dive.
266	00:17:14	00:17:16	What's my cousin got to do with the fight?
267	00:17:16	00:17:20	Your cousin bet 20 large on Javier Molina at five-to-one against.
268	00:17:20	00:17:22	Hey, he's always been a lucky guy.
269	00:17:22	00:17:24	Yeah, I know, I'm sure he is.
270	00:17:24	00:17:26	Well, you know how this works.
271	00:17:26	00:17:32	I mean, you hear the fight's fixed you tip off your cousin for a piece of the action he tells a couple of friends, so on, so on.
272	00:17:32	00:17:35	They make a bet at the last minute, and the odds go south.
273	00:17:35	00:17:37	Hey, big fight, money moves around.
274	00:17:37	00:17:38	Oh, yeah, that's cool.
275	00:17:38	00:17:40	This is Vegas. Money flows.
276	00:17:40	00:17:42	As long as it doesn't flow out of your pocket.
277	00:17:42	00:17:46	Maybe that's why you let the fight go on so long.
278	00:17:46	00:17:49	Yeah, you see a fighter in trouble you give him a standing eight.
279	00:17:49	00:17:51	If he comes out a winner, you're in the poorhouse.
280	00:17:51	00:17:55	So, what are you saying, that if I'd stopped the fight Laroi Steele would still be alive?
281	00:17:57	00:17:58	You charging me with something?
282	00:17:58	00:18:01	No. Not yet.
283	00:18:01	00:18:04	You know where to find me.
284	00:18:04	00:18:06	Randy Watkins.
285	00:18:06	00:18:08	I'm Detective O'Riley.
286	00:18:08	00:18:10	This is Nick Stokes of the crime lab.
287	00:18:10	00:18:13	Hi, there. Where'd you get the cut on your forearm, man?
288	00:18:13	00:18:14	You practicing for a job at Benihana?
289	00:18:14	00:18:15	Hey, this is a hospital.
290	00:18:15	00:18:17	I got doctor-client privilege here, huh?
291	00:18:17	00:18:20	Well, you don't get any privileges, Randy.
292	00:18:20	00:18:21	You're wearing stolen property.
293	00:18:23	00:18:25	Let me trade that bracelet in for this one.
294	00:18:27	00:18:34	Ladies and gentlemen, in this corner wearing red leather coming from the great fighting city of Everlast, USA...
295	00:18:35	00:18:38	the gloves that Javier Molina wore when he killed Laroi Steele.
296	00:18:38	00:18:40	This is a piece of boxing history.
297	00:18:40	00:18:43	Do you know how much this would go for on eBay?
298	00:18:43	00:18:45	Greg, the residue on the gloves, what is it?
299	00:18:45	00:18:52	magnesium, potassium, etcetera urea, choline and uric acid.
300	00:18:52	00:18:53	Sweat.
301	00:18:53	00:18:55	Occasionally found at a boxing match.
302	00:18:55	00:18:57	Oh, but wait.
303	00:18:57	00:19:08	In this corner fighting way out of his weight class coming from... that place that textiles come from a cotton swab soaked in sufentanil.
304	00:19:09	00:19:10	Sufentanil?
305	00:19:10	00:19:13	I did recover this swab from the victim's corner.
306	00:19:14	00:19:17	Time to talk to the cut man.
307	00:19:17	00:19:19	I would have got a bonus if we won.
308	00:19:19	00:19:21	Why would I mess with the guy who pays me?
309	00:19:21	00:19:22	Why is for the lawyers.
310	00:19:22	00:19:27	Your corner, your swab your drugs.
311	00:19:30	00:19:31	Suck it up.
312	00:19:33	00:19:35	I been doing this 28 years.
313	00:19:35	00:19:41	Back when every cut man around was using Monsels solution getting it in kids' eyes blinding them.
314	00:19:41	00:19:43	I wouldn't touch the stuff.
315	00:19:43	00:19:45	And I didn't hurt Laroi.
316	00:19:45	00:19:47	I been in his corner six fights.
317	00:19:47	00:19:49	Every one, he fought hard and never stiffed me.
318	00:19:49	00:19:52	Him dying was a tragedy.
319	00:19:53	00:19:55	Molina trains here?
320	00:19:55	00:19:57	Yeah, maybe. He owns the place.
321	00:19:57	00:19:58	And you're looking for work.
322	00:20:00	00:20:01	Work comes to me.
323	00:20:01	00:20:04	Well, here's something else that's coming to you.
324	00:20:08	00:20:11	What, you want me to give you my bag?
325	00:20:12	00:20:14	We're not asking.
326	00:20:25	00:20:27	It's kind of primitive.
327	00:20:27	00:20:28	So is boxing.
328	00:20:30	00:20:32	Did you get anywhere with that mercury?
329	00:20:32	00:20:33	Yeah. Ensenada, Mexico.
330	00:20:34	00:20:36	Molina has a personal physician down there.
331	00:20:36	00:20:39	It turns out that mercury is used in a folk remedy for empacho.
332	00:20:39	00:20:40	It's a chronic stomach condition.
333	00:20:41	00:20:41	And Molina has it?
334	00:20:41	00:20:43	Medical history confirms it.
335	00:20:43	00:20:44	The guy eats metal.
336	00:20:44	00:20:46	It's not the eating that will get you.
337	00:20:46	00:20:48	The poison's in the mercury vapor.
338	00:20:48	00:20:49	It's toxic.
339	00:20:49	00:20:50	Well, I guess we're left with the sedative.
340	00:20:50	00:20:51	Any luck?
341	00:20:51	00:20:52	Greg's working on it.
342	00:20:52	00:20:53	Three guns found at the scene.
343	00:20:54	00:20:56	None match the bullets recovered from the victim.
344	00:20:56	00:20:57	What does that tell us?
345	00:20:57	00:20:58	The shooter kept his weapon.
346	00:20:59	00:21:02	Means he likes his gun and may have used it before.
347	00:21:03	00:21:06	Which is where the shell case and IBAS come in.
348	00:21:06	00:21:08	I'll run it against the national database.
349	00:21:08	00:21:12	Firing pin impressions and breech face marks a closer look.
350	00:21:12	00:21:13	Well, okay.
351	00:21:13	00:21:14	Got us a hit.
352	00:21:14	00:21:22	Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department found shell casings from the same gun used in a gang murder two years ago.
353	00:21:22	00:21:24	They get a conviction on the suspect?
354	00:21:24	00:21:25	No. Guy beat the rap.
355	00:21:25	00:21:31	Timothy Fontaine, aka 'Tiny Tim.' Member of the Snakebacks.
356	00:21:31	00:21:33	Current residence unknown.
357	00:21:33	00:21:36	I bet I could find where he stays in Vegas.
358	00:21:36	00:21:37	Hey.
359	00:21:40	00:21:44	I guess Tiny's mother can be proud of her son for one thing.
360	00:21:44	00:21:46	He sure knows how to clean a room.
361	00:21:46	00:21:49	Well, there is one Snakeback still in town.
362	00:21:49	00:21:50	Who's that?
363	00:21:50	00:21:53	That guy right over there.
364	00:21:53	00:21:55	What's his dealio?
365	00:21:55	00:21:58	Okay, I'm The Man, I take care of my people.
366	00:21:58	00:22:00	That is Jerome Anderson.
367	00:22:00	00:22:02	AKA, The Man.
368	00:22:02	00:22:03	The Man?
369	00:22:03	00:22:05	The Man.
370	00:22:05	00:22:09	Technically a former Snakeback who shed his skin and worked his way into the real world.
371	00:22:09	00:22:13	Record producer, clothing designer sports agent.
372	00:22:13	00:22:15	Why didn't you get a warrant for his room?
373	00:22:15	00:22:16	We're working on it.
374	00:22:16	00:22:18	He's got an entire law firm on retainer.
375	00:22:18	00:22:20	...five percent here, ten percent there.
376	00:22:20	00:22:23	Better get back in the ring, Laroi, and keep fighting.
377	00:22:23	00:22:25	See, what Laroi needed was a giver not a taker.
378	00:22:25	00:22:30	That's why he came to me, The Man so I could stand by his side and give him honest representation.
379	00:22:31	00:22:32	Police.
380	00:22:32	00:22:38	Another thing that The Man understands because he comes from the same place as today's athletes.
381	00:22:38	00:22:39	I'm Detective Vega.
382	00:22:39	00:22:41	This is Catherine Willows from the Crime Lab.
383	00:22:41	00:22:42	We'd like to ask you a few questions.
384	00:22:42	00:22:44	The Man ain't got nothing to hide.
385	00:22:44	00:22:46	We're looking for members of the Snakebacks.
386	00:22:46	00:22:48	A Timothy Fontaine, in particular.
387	00:22:49	00:22:51	No idea.
388	00:22:51	00:22:53	The Man is here on business.
389	00:22:53	00:22:55	So are we.
390	00:22:56	00:23:00	Do you mind if I ask how The Man got the burn mark on his neck?
391	00:23:01	00:23:04	Well, all the ladies say that The Man is hot.
392	00:23:04	00:23:07	I guess I must have just burned myself and forgot all about it.
393	00:23:09	00:23:10	No, you didn't.
394	00:23:10	00:23:12	Are you crazy? No, no, no, no.
395	00:23:13	00:23:14	Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
396	00:23:14	00:23:16	Ooh, ooh...
397	00:23:16	00:23:18	I guess you are hot.
398	00:23:18	00:23:19	Oh, that's old.
399	00:23:19	00:23:21	The Man is all about the new.
400	00:23:30	00:23:32	Did you get a hold of that cut man?
401	00:23:32	00:23:36	Yeah, we found sufentanil in a bottle of coagulant in the guy's kit.
402	00:23:36	00:23:38	Doesn't make sense.
403	00:23:38	00:23:41	If the cut man did it why would he hold on to the evidence?
404	00:23:41	00:23:42	I was thinking the same thing.
405	00:23:42	00:23:45	I'm not convinced he actually knew it was in his kit.
406	00:23:45	00:23:48	The prints that I got off the bottle came back to...
407	00:23:48	00:23:53	Gerry Barone, the victim's manager.
408	00:23:53	00:23:57	And I thought Don King was bad.
409	00:23:59	00:24:03	The reason my prints are in the system is I'm a foster parent.
410	00:24:03	00:24:05	Six kids in 30 years.
411	00:24:05	00:24:06	Treated them like my own.
412	00:24:06	00:24:08	Trained them, took them off the streets.
413	00:24:08	00:24:09	We know that.
414	00:24:09	00:24:11	We know you're a good guy.
415	00:24:14	00:24:17	So what made you dope up Laroi Steele?
416	00:24:17	00:24:21	We found your prints on a bottle of coagulant.
417	00:24:21	00:24:25	It was laced with a sedative.
418	00:24:25	00:24:27	Found it in the cut man's kit.
419	00:24:27	00:24:29	I was trying to save Laroi.
420	00:24:29	00:24:31	By drugging him?
421	00:24:31	00:24:35	We kept it out of the press but in their last fight, Molina hurt him bad.
422	00:24:35	00:24:36	How bad?
423	00:24:36	00:24:42	The signs were all there in training-- sagging eye, drooping shoulder, brain damage down the road.
424	00:24:42	00:24:44	Laroi couldn't handle another beating.
425	00:24:44	00:24:47	But I couldn't talk him out of this fight.
426	00:24:47	00:24:49	Molina got under his skin.
427	00:24:49	00:24:52	Laroi wouldn't let it go.
428	00:24:53	00:24:55	I taught him not to quit.
429	00:24:56	00:24:59	I was trying to get him out alive.
430	00:25:01	00:25:05	Laroi was 16 years old the first time I saw him fight.
431	00:25:05	00:25:10	And the only thing faster than his hands was his mouth.
432	00:25:10	00:25:19	There was this one time he made his sparring partner laugh so hard the man pissed his trunks before he hit the mat.
433	00:25:21	00:25:25	Can you imagine that?
434	00:25:28	00:25:32	We arrested the guy and recovered all the jewelry.
435	00:25:32	00:25:35	Thank you so much, Mr. Stokes. Not a problem.
436	00:25:35	00:25:40	I just need you to fill out some documentation and then I can release your ring back to you, okay?
437	00:25:40	00:25:42	That's not your ring.
438	00:25:42	00:25:43	Of course it is.
439	00:25:43	00:25:45	I'm telling you, that is not the ring I gave you.
440	00:25:46	00:25:47	That's a different cut.
441	00:25:47	00:25:50	Now I wore this ring on my finger every day for five years.
442	00:25:50	00:25:52	I think that I... I bought you that ring.
443	00:25:52	00:25:58	Who do you think spent the week looking for the perfect stone for our first anniversary?
444	00:25:58	00:26:02	Sir, I matched every item recovered to a log provided by the jewelry store piece for piece.
445	00:26:02	00:26:06	Then maybe you should explain to me why I'm not looking at my wife's ring.
446	00:26:06	00:26:09	I need to explain to you?
447	00:26:09	00:26:11	Come on, Mack.
448	00:26:11	00:26:13	How do I know you didn't switch this ring out?
449	00:26:13	00:26:15	Man, I would n...
450	00:26:15	00:26:16	'Cause that's not the way it works.
451	00:26:17	00:26:21	Oh, we screw the out-of-towners and nobody's going to care, right?
452	00:26:21	00:26:23	Are you making a formal accusation? You bet I am.
453	00:26:23	00:26:24	Knock yourself out, big dog.
454	00:26:24	00:26:25	Forms are at the front desk.
455	00:26:33	00:26:34	Okay...
456	00:26:34	00:26:38	It's about a month ago at a pre-fight press conference.
457	00:26:38	00:26:41	Check it out, he lost the last couple of times.
458	00:26:41	00:26:42	I'm the one who did all the whupping.
459	00:26:42	00:26:45	And I'm just going to do a three-peat, baby, you know?
460	00:26:45	00:26:47	What I'm saying is anytime, anyplace, cabron.
461	00:26:47	00:26:49	You can't wait to get whupped, is that it?
462	00:26:51	00:26:54	Steele is slurring his words.
463	00:26:54	00:26:58	Fast forward to the fight.
464	00:26:58	00:27:02	Watch his shoulder, how he keeps dropping it.
465	00:27:05	00:27:06	The manager was right.
466	00:27:07	00:27:09	Pugilistic dementia.
467	00:27:09	00:27:13	They say eight out of ten boxers suffer some form of brain damage later on in life.
468	00:27:13	00:27:15	The Greatest-- Muhammad Ali.
469	00:27:15	00:27:18	Steele must've known what was happening to him.
470	00:27:18	00:27:20	He would never admit it.
471	00:27:20	00:27:23	Fighters need to psych themselves up before a fight.
472	00:27:23	00:27:24	They got to believe they're going to win.
473	00:27:25	00:27:26	Or they'd never fight.
474	00:27:26	00:27:31	In a way, every opponent Laroi Steele fought contributed to his death.
475	00:27:35	00:27:40	I don't know if he was incredibly stupid or just... brave.
476	00:27:45	00:27:51	We'll contest this on the grounds that your request to the judge was based on a specious connection to the Snakebacks.
477	00:27:51	00:27:53	Contest all you want.
478	00:27:53	00:27:56	It's still coming after the fact.
479	00:27:56	00:27:57	Open.
480	00:27:57	00:27:59	The warrant was based on physical findings.
481	00:27:59	00:28:02	A burn mark?
482	00:28:02	00:28:03	Could have happened anywhere.
483	00:28:03	00:28:09	Jerome is under the misguided impression that he's a one-man pyrotechnic display.
484	00:28:10	00:28:14	Watch too many movies and kids start to think that people actually shoot like that.
485	00:28:17	00:28:20	The most you're going to prove is my client was in the vicinity.
486	00:28:20	00:28:22	Period. That's it.
487	00:28:22	00:28:25	If his DNA matches what we found on the shell casing we'll be able to extend the scope of the warrant.
488	00:28:26	00:28:28	If it matches.
489	00:28:28	00:28:29	File says you're a smart guy.
490	00:28:29	00:28:31	Three years in Georgetown.
491	00:28:31	00:28:33	Why turn stupid all of a sudden?
492	00:28:33	00:28:35	Give us the guy we're looking for.
493	00:28:35	00:28:43	Look, we all know that you forget what the word loyalty means as soon as you step away from the mirror so what do the Snakebacks get you?
494	00:28:43	00:28:46	R-E-S-P-E-C-T, baby.
495	00:28:46	00:28:49	I thought that's what college was for.
496	00:28:49	00:28:52	I went to school.
497	00:28:52	00:29:05	In fact, I have carefully analyzed business models of African American entrepreneurs such as Darian Daze at Dis-Kard Enterprises which grosses $250 million a year.
498	00:29:05	00:29:16	And my analysis has led me to understand that an emerging CEO needs to have as solid a command of flow charts and spreadsheets as he does a bad-ass street rep.
499	00:29:16	00:29:21	And let me tell you something, sweetness, I got it all coming and going.
500	00:29:21	00:29:28	So the more you try to stress me the more you're just selling me to the people out on the streets.
501	00:29:28	00:29:31	So crime pays.
502	00:29:31	00:29:34	Oh, don't hate the player, hate the game.
503	00:29:35	00:29:37	Right, you don't make the rules, you just exploit them.
504	00:29:37	00:29:40	Ain't that a bitch.
505	00:30:31	00:30:32	Nice work on that jewelry heist.
506	00:30:32	00:30:34	Yeah, well, it's not done yet.
507	00:30:34	00:30:35	You got the guy.
508	00:30:35	00:30:36	Oh, yeah, it was a little rough.
509	00:30:36	00:30:38	We had to check a few ERs, but we snatched him up.
510	00:30:38	00:30:41	Being efficient is not a bad thing, Nick.
511	00:30:42	00:30:45	Yeah. Why are you tossing me a softball and putting everyone else on real cases?
512	00:30:45	00:30:47	You wanted to work solo.
513	00:30:47	00:30:50	Yeah, but it's like Night of the Pifflings out there and I'm on a smash and grab.
514	00:30:50	00:30:51	Pifflings?
515	00:30:51	00:30:53	Puffin offspring.
516	00:30:55	00:31:01	First time out of the nest every year they crash land in this town near Iceland because they're attracted to the lights of human civilization.
517	00:31:03	00:31:06	It's the same way people flock to Vegas for a fight.
518	00:31:09	00:31:10	Animal Planet.
519	00:31:11	00:31:18	How come when you talk about bugs everyone says you're a genius but when I talk about birds everyone says I watch too much television?
520	00:31:18	00:31:19	I don't know.
521	00:31:20	00:31:24	Look, the next night of the Pifflings you get the first dead body.
522	00:31:25	00:31:26	Copy that.
523	00:31:29	00:31:34	The victim suffered tripod fractures of the zygomatic arch in two places.
524	00:31:34	00:31:37	There's also a fracture of the orbital floor.
525	00:31:37	00:31:43	This tripod fracture of the zygoma is what caused the flattening of the victim's face.
526	00:31:43	00:31:46	It indicates that he was struck with an extremely powerful blow.
527	00:31:46	00:31:48	Which couldn't be caused by normal boxing gloves.
528	00:31:48	00:31:49	We checked Molina's gloves.
529	00:31:49	00:31:51	There's nothing in them or on them.
530	00:31:51	00:31:53	Well, we're missing something.
531	00:31:53	00:31:54	We have a problem.
532	00:31:54	00:31:56	Pile it on.
533	00:31:56	00:32:02	Well, in the interests of posterity I took it upon myself to establish provenance for the killer gloves I mean DNA-wise.
534	00:32:02	00:32:07	On my own time, of course of which I have precious little so that should count for something.
535	00:32:07	00:32:09	Greg, why are you always doing this?
536	00:32:09	00:32:11	Because you make me nervous.
537	00:32:11	00:32:16	My point is, the epithelials found on the surface of the glove.
538	00:32:16	00:32:18	They're not Laroi Steele's.
539	00:32:18	00:32:20	Those aren't the gloves that killed him.
540	00:32:51	00:32:53	Gloves look brand-new.
541	00:32:53	00:32:54	Padding's still stiff.
542	00:32:55	00:32:57	It's like they've never been used.
543	00:33:06	00:33:09	What are all these dots?
544	00:33:20	00:33:22	Looks like a little piece of red leather.
545	00:33:22	00:33:24	Hmm.
546	00:33:31	00:33:33	And more mercury.
547	00:33:33	00:33:35	Well, Molina does take it for his stomach, right?
548	00:33:35	00:33:39	He's a sloppy eater.
549	00:33:40	00:33:43	Hmm.
550	00:33:43	00:33:44	Mercury's volatile.
551	00:33:44	00:33:48	It emits a toxic vapor at room temperature.
552	00:33:48	00:33:52	So you're saying if I find the vapor I find the mercury.
553	00:34:30	00:34:31	Grissom.
554	00:35:08	00:35:09	That your signature?
555	00:35:09	00:35:11	Yeah. That's my signature.
556	00:35:11	00:35:12	So what?
557	00:35:12	00:35:19	Well, according to fight rules you were supposed to watch Molina wrap his hands and sign them, then watch him put on his gloves and then sign those.
558	00:35:19	00:35:20	Which is what I did.
559	00:35:20	00:35:25	Okay, you signed his wraps but the gloves that we found were not the gloves used in the fight.
560	00:35:25	00:35:26	Molina switched them.
561	00:35:27	00:35:28	There's no way.
562	00:35:28	00:35:30	You watched Molina glove up?
563	00:35:30	00:35:32	Not exactly.
564	00:35:32	00:35:35	Come on. Get her out of here.
565	00:35:35	00:35:36	Look. It was a big fight.
566	00:35:37	00:35:37	There was a lot of pressure.
567	00:35:38	00:35:39	You've got to give the fighters a little space.
568	00:35:39	00:35:43	So, no one saw him put his gloves on.
569	00:35:46	00:35:48	I guess not.
570	00:35:48	00:35:53	I should have called you first to apologize for my husband's unfortunate outburst.
571	00:35:53	00:35:56	You know what? You should apologize.
572	00:35:56	00:35:57	But not for your husband.
573	00:35:57	00:35:59	Excuse me?
574	00:35:59	00:36:01	You know damn well your diamond isn't a diamond.
575	00:36:01	00:36:03	It's a substance called moissanite.
576	00:36:03	00:36:05	Really?
577	00:36:05	00:36:10	Really. White light refractions and inclusions of your stone are inconsistent with a real diamond's.
578	00:36:10	00:36:14	Then the thief must have switched the stone before you caught him.
579	00:36:14	00:36:16	The thief. Yeah.
580	00:36:16	00:36:17	I don't think so.
581	00:36:18	00:36:21	Because before the store could clean your ring I was able to collect DNA.
582	00:36:22	00:36:25	Wow, that's very thorough of you.
583	00:36:25	00:36:26	Isn't it?
584	00:36:26	00:36:33	You know, it's my guess you switched out the stone some time ago because judging from your husband's response he knew nothing about it.
585	00:36:34	00:36:35	Mr. Stokes, can I...?
586	00:36:35	00:36:37	You're from Texas, aren't you?
587	00:36:37	00:36:39	'Cause I can always tell.
588	00:36:39	00:36:41	I'm a criminalist for Clark Country, Nevade.
589	00:36:42	00:36:47	Yes, well, one's body might reside elsewhere but one's heart never really leaves home, does it?
590	00:36:48	00:36:56	Look, all you have to do is say that you recovered a fake diamond which is the truth.
591	00:36:56	00:36:58	So you can file a false insurance claim which is a felony?
592	00:36:58	00:37:04	Better yet, why don't I have an adjuster come over to your place and check out all your rocks and see which ones are real and which ones you've switched out?
593	00:37:04	00:37:06	No?
594	00:37:06	00:37:11	Look, if you find yourself in a hole, the best thing to do is stop digging.
595	00:37:11	00:37:12	You know what I mean?
596	00:37:12	00:37:14	Sounds like a plan.
597	00:37:14	00:37:16	Put it in motion.
598	00:37:19	00:37:21	I guess clothes do make the man.
599	00:37:21	00:37:24	In this case, the man makes the clothes.
600	00:37:24	00:37:28	And produces the music and represents the athletes...
601	00:37:28	00:37:32	when he's not involved in street shootings, of course.
602	00:37:32	00:37:36	And when you asked him what he was wearing the night of the murder, he couldn't remember?
603	00:37:36	00:37:42	As far as he's concerned murder is just another way to separate himself from the Calvins and Ralphs of the world.
604	00:37:42	00:37:44	Calvin and Ralph?
605	00:37:44	00:37:47	Klein and Lauren. Fashion.
606	00:37:47	00:37:50	Oh. Well, for most CSIs, fashion is irrelevant.
607	00:37:50	00:37:51	Speak for yourself.
608	00:37:51	00:37:55	The only thing between me and a wardrobe like this is a few extra zeros on my paycheck.
609	00:37:55	00:37:58	Well, what's standing between you and this Tiny Tim character?
610	00:37:58	00:37:59	The Mojave.
611	00:37:59	00:38:02	Highway patrol is out looking for our guy.
612	00:38:02	00:38:04	Odds are that Tiny Tim is back in L.A.
613	00:38:04	00:38:07	Evidence disposed of along the way.
614	00:38:07	00:38:11	That means my last chance of connecting the dots is somewhere along these racks.
615	00:38:11	00:38:13	Fibers, GSR, blood.
616	00:38:13	00:38:17	Hey. Guess who never left town?
617	00:38:24	00:38:26	Calling card?
618	00:38:26	00:38:28	10th Street Vandals.
619	00:38:31	00:38:34	.380 automatic.
620	00:38:34	00:38:36	Tiny's favorite piece.
621	00:38:36	00:38:39	Odds are it traces back to the original murder.
622	00:38:39	00:38:41	Same as it always does.
623	00:38:41	00:38:42	Somebody gets dissed.
624	00:39:04	00:39:06	The Snakebacks kill a Vandal.
625	00:39:06	00:39:09	Then the Vandals kill a Snakeback.
626	00:39:09	00:39:11	Everyone goes home satisfied.
627	00:39:11	00:39:13	Round and round and round it goes.
628	00:39:13	00:39:16	Where it stops, nobody knows.
629	00:39:19	00:39:24	There was this one case where a boxer put lead shot in his gloves to increase his punching power.
630	00:39:24	00:39:29	And also ancient Greek and Roman pugilists used a glove weighted with metal, called a cestus.
631	00:39:29	00:39:31	You making a classical reference?
632	00:39:31	00:39:33	Yeah. I thought you'd like that.
633	00:39:33	00:39:37	Question is, if Molina was using mercury to load up how'd it get into his gloves?
634	00:39:37	00:39:38	Well, he injected it.
635	00:39:38	00:39:45	Those circular pieces of leather that you found in Molina's locker are the same diameter as a 14-gauge needle.
636	00:39:45	00:39:47	Well, mercury's incredibly dense.
637	00:39:47	00:39:50	It could easily be contained in the leather in the form of a boxing glove.
638	00:39:50	00:39:57	The boxing gloves weighed eight ounces so the question is, would a few ounces of mercury be enough to cause the damage that we observed on the victim?
639	00:39:57	00:39:59	Right.
640	00:39:59	00:40:01	I smell an experiment.
641	00:40:02	00:40:05	All right.
642	00:40:05	00:40:06	Normal gloves.
643	00:40:08	00:40:09	Ready.
644	00:40:11	00:40:12	And... go.
645	00:40:21	00:40:23	Good?
646	00:40:23	00:40:25	Little more.
647	00:40:30	00:40:32	Good.
648	00:40:35	00:40:37	Loaded gloves.
649	00:40:37	00:40:39	Ready?
650	00:40:39	00:40:40	And...
651	00:40:40	00:40:42	go.
652	00:40:46	00:40:48	Ooh, this thing's are heavy.
653	00:40:53	00:40:54	Good.
654	00:40:54	00:40:56	Good, good.
655	00:40:59	00:41:03	And mercury kills steel.
656	00:41:04	00:41:06	Boxing is a combat sport.
657	00:41:06	00:41:08	Sometimes fighters die, okay?
658	00:41:08	00:41:09	That's all part of the game.
659	00:41:10	00:41:12	Laroi Steele's death was a tragedy not a murder.
660	00:41:12	00:41:15	It became murder when your client injected mercury into his gloves.
661	00:41:15	00:41:19	And your hands, Molina literally, became lethal weapons.
662	00:41:32	00:41:34	Heavy gloves.
663	00:41:34	00:41:37	That's why you kept your hands to your side.
664	00:41:37	00:41:45	It also kept the mercury With every punch a little bit got forced down through the padding through the seams and on to your hands.
665	00:41:45	00:41:46	That's how it got on your wraps.
666	00:41:46	00:41:47	And into your lungs.
667	00:41:47	00:41:50	And finally out into your urine.
668	00:41:50	00:41:53	We tested the sample that you gave the boxing commission after the fight.
669	00:41:53	00:41:54	It came back positive for mercury.
670	00:41:55	00:41:56	I have empacho.
671	00:41:56	00:41:58	I take mercury for my stomach problems.
672	00:41:58	00:42:00	We didn't find mercury in your stomach.
673	00:42:00	00:42:04	We found it in your locker in your gym bags, on your wraps...
674	00:42:04	00:42:14	When the fight was over, your trainer cut the tape off your gloves and you took the pieces and put them in the hamper with a pair of sparring gloves, just in case anybody wondered what had happened to them.
675	00:42:14	00:42:19	But the real gloves were in your gym bag at that hospital, weren't they?
676	00:42:21	00:42:24	Steele had already kicked your ass... twice before?
677	00:42:24	00:42:27	Must have been humiliating.
678	00:42:27	00:42:32	You push a man too far, there are consequences.
679	00:42:39	00:42:43	You knew there was no way you could beat Steele in a fair fight.
680	00:42:43	00:42:52	The best way to punish a guy is to beat him to death in the ring in front of two million people on pay-per-view.
681	00:42:52	00:42:54	That's boxing.
682	00:42:56	00:42:57	No, that's murder.
683	00:42:57	00:42:58	I'll see you in court.
684	00:43:06	00:43:08	So that means the title's vacant, right?
685	00:43:08	00:43:09	Not for long.
686	00:43:10	00:43:13	I heard it's Lopez versus Lewis at Caesar's in six months.
