0	00:00:06	00:00:09	Thank you. Have a good night.
1	00:00:09	00:00:12	Eagles covered, bruh.
2	00:00:12	00:00:13	Cough up the 20.
3	00:00:13	00:00:14	Man, backdoor touchdown.
4	00:00:14	00:00:15	Man, kills you every time.
5	00:00:15	00:00:17	Ha-ha!
6	00:00:17	00:00:19	Alright no more martini's for you.
7	00:00:28	00:00:29	Welcome to the Orpheus.
8	00:00:29	00:00:31	You checking in or just donating?
9	00:00:31	00:00:33	Checking in. Any bags, sir?
10	00:00:33	00:00:36	I got this one. Grab the one in the trunk.
11	00:01:09	00:01:09	Car bomb.
12	00:01:10	00:01:11	Driver and valet are dead.
13	00:01:11	00:01:13	Another valet is critical.
14	00:01:13	00:01:15	Got at least a dozen injured.
15	00:01:15	00:01:16	I was having dinner here.
16	00:01:16	00:01:17	Was on my way out.
17	00:01:17	00:01:20	It'd gone off a couple of seconds later, you'd be picking my badge up off the ground.
18	00:01:20	00:01:22	Thank God you're all right.
19	00:01:22	00:01:24	Sheriff, did they, uh, sweep the area for secondaries?
20	00:01:24	00:01:26	Bomb squad says it's all clear.
21	00:01:26	00:01:28	We'll photo-document the scene.
22	00:01:28	00:01:29	Overalls from all angles.
23	00:01:29	00:01:31	Aerials as well.
24	00:02:20	00:02:22	Guess it wasn't a sniper.
25	00:02:22	00:02:24	Fixed ammunition in the trunk.
26	00:02:24	00:02:28	The gunpowder must have heated up, and the, uh, rounds cooked off.
27	00:02:32	00:02:36	I'm going to start marking the evidence.
28	00:02:36	00:02:42	I believe the, uh, glass pressure traveled from the rear of the vehicle, through the front...
29	00:02:44	00:02:48	...and evidently separated the driver's body at the ankles.
30	00:02:49	00:02:52	David, we have body parts in the car.
31	00:02:52	00:02:54	I've been looking for the feet.
32	00:02:54	00:02:55	I found 'em.
33	00:02:55	00:02:57	We gotta ID the driver ASAP.
34	00:03:02	00:03:04	Well, the VIN number's still attached.
35	00:03:04	00:03:05	Write that down.
36	00:03:05	00:03:06	Call in the DMV.
37	00:03:06	00:03:08	Yes, sir.
38	00:03:35	00:03:37	Sorry, Catherine.
39	00:03:37	00:03:40	Traffic's backed up all the way to the Strip.
40	00:03:40	00:03:42	Got a SIG-Sauer.
41	00:03:42	00:03:44	Probably the driver's.
42	00:03:44	00:03:45	I'll start bagging.
43	00:03:45	00:03:48	Gather the detritus and separate out the bomb components.
44	00:03:48	00:03:51	Okay.
45	00:03:55	00:03:57	Here's press.
46	00:03:57	00:03:59	You're on.
47	00:03:59	00:04:02	Wish I could help, but, uh, I got a vehicle to process.
48	00:04:02	00:04:05	Come on, Grissom-- a bomb goes off these days, they're going to assume it's a hit.
49	00:04:05	00:04:07	What are you thinking?
50	00:04:07	00:04:09	I'm not thinking. I'm just looking.
51	00:04:09	00:04:11	That's good.
52	00:04:11	00:04:13	Can I use that?
53	00:04:20	00:04:24	Amelia Rueben. 25.
54	00:04:24	00:04:27	She a guest?
55	00:04:27	00:04:29	Or a guest of a guest?
56	00:04:29	00:04:30	Myles Rueben's wife.
57	00:04:30	00:04:32	Who found her?
58	00:04:32	00:04:35	About 40 minutes ago, a maid walked in for turn-down service.
59	00:04:35	00:04:37	Called hotel security.
60	00:04:37	00:04:39	Still on a timer.
61	00:04:41	00:04:45	Got a wine glass.
62	00:04:45	00:04:47	Does Myles know?
63	00:04:47	00:04:49	He's still onstage.
64	00:05:06	00:05:08	Got a wine bottle.
65	00:05:13	00:05:15	Almost empty.
66	00:05:22	00:05:23	Alcohol.
67	00:05:23	00:05:24	Hot tub.
68	00:05:24	00:05:26	A little bit too relaxed.
69	00:05:31	00:05:35	Temperature of the spa water makes liver temp irrelevant.
70	00:05:35	00:05:39	But given the redness of her eyes, I'd estimate she's been dead less than an hour.
71	00:06:00	00:06:03	It just dawned on me what's Rueben's biggest hit was.
72	00:06:04	00:06:05	What's that?
73	00:06:05	00:06:06	Amelia.
74	00:06:22	00:06:25	I'll handle this when Myles breaks for the encore.
75	00:06:25	00:06:27	Been the kid's manager since '97.
76	00:06:29	00:06:30	I should be the one to tell him.
77	00:06:44	00:06:45	How was that, Sam? Sound good?
78	00:06:45	00:06:47	Great, Myles. The best.
79	00:06:47	00:06:48	What? What's wrong?
80	00:06:48	00:06:49	I missed a high note, huh?
81	00:06:49	00:06:50	Man...
82	00:06:50	00:06:52	No, no, no. Everything sounded great.
83	00:06:52	00:06:56	Listen, Myles, these are crime scene investigators.
84	00:06:56	00:06:58	Myles, uh...
85	00:06:58	00:07:00	there's been an accident.
86	00:07:00	00:07:01	An accident?
87	00:07:01	00:07:02	What, is it my mother?
88	00:07:02	00:07:03	Did-did something happen back East?
89	00:07:03	00:07:05	No, no, no. Your mother's fine.
90	00:07:05	00:07:10	Look, Myles, it's, uh...
91	00:07:10	00:07:16	Mr. Rueben, I'm very sorry to have to tell you this, but your wife is dead.
92	00:07:22	00:07:24	Amelia! Amelia!
93	00:07:30	00:07:33	Turn the houselights up, Sam.
94	00:07:33	00:07:35	There's no encore tonight.
95	00:07:47	00:07:49	I heard about the bombing.
96	00:07:49	00:07:50	I'm here to help.
97	00:07:50	00:07:52	I located the seat of the explosion.
98	00:07:52	00:07:54	The bomb was attached to the fuel tank.
99	00:07:54	00:07:56	Gas-enhanced.
100	00:07:56	00:07:57	Bomber maximized his bang.
101	00:07:57	00:08:01	You really want to help, climb under here and find the initiation switch.
102	00:08:20	00:08:23	Got a stray wire.
103	00:08:25	00:08:31	Leading away from the gas tank, right into the center of the dash.
104	00:08:33	00:08:36	Nowhere near the loom.
105	00:08:41	00:08:44	The digital clock was the switch.
106	00:08:47	00:08:49	It was time-activated.
107	00:08:49	00:08:50	What's next?
108	00:08:51	00:08:53	Nick has to reconstruct the bomb.
109	00:10:06	00:10:07	It was a pipe bomb.
110	00:10:07	00:10:09	Initiated by a lightbulb filament.
111	00:10:10	00:10:11	Bomb was attached to the fuel tank.
112	00:10:11	00:10:16	There were still magnet and solder fragments attached to the pipe.
113	00:10:16	00:10:17	Did you find any kind of timing device?
114	00:10:18	00:10:20	Digital clock in the dash.
115	00:10:20	00:10:21	What about the type of explosive used?
116	00:10:22	00:10:23	Not yet.
117	00:10:23	00:10:26	I was about to analyze the chemical residue left on the bomb frags.
118	00:10:26	00:10:29	Be sure to do an organics and inorganics test.
119	00:10:29	00:10:31	Will do.
120	00:10:31	00:10:34	So...
121	00:10:34	00:10:35	what does it all mean?
122	00:10:38	00:10:39	What does what all mean?
123	00:10:39	00:10:41	Don't play dumb with me, Gil.
124	00:10:41	00:10:43	Explosions lead the news.
125	00:10:43	00:10:45	I need to know who, and I need to know why.
126	00:10:45	00:10:48	Well, the evidence is only teaching us about the bomb, not the bomber.
127	00:10:48	00:10:49	What about a signature?
128	00:10:49	00:10:52	Is there anything distinct, unusual about this particular bomb?
129	00:10:52	00:10:55	No.
130	00:10:55	00:10:57	Nothing.
131	00:11:03	00:11:05	Amelia Rueben didn't drown.
132	00:11:05	00:11:10	If she had, there'd be fluid in her nasal sinuses.
133	00:11:12	00:11:14	Clear as a bell.
134	00:11:15	00:11:17	What was the cause of death?
135	00:11:17	00:11:18	Cardiac arrest.
136	00:11:19	00:11:21	She was only 25.
137	00:11:22	00:11:23	Was there some kind of defect?
138	00:11:23	00:11:25	No, her heart was in perfect condition.
139	00:11:25	00:11:27	In fact, I have it over here.
140	00:11:29	00:11:31	See the myocardium?
141	00:11:31	00:11:34	There's no evidence of hemorrhage, infarct or scarring.
142	00:11:34	00:11:36	No coronary occlusions.
143	00:11:36	00:11:37	I can't explain it.
144	00:11:37	00:11:39	It's like a mystery of the heart.
145	00:11:42	00:11:46	So, that SIG-Sauer you found...
146	00:11:46	00:11:48	Yes. Relatively nondescript.
147	00:11:48	00:11:50	Uh, the blue stuff, sent a sample to Trace.
148	00:11:50	00:11:53	Pretty sure it's from some sort of bag that melted in the explosion.
149	00:11:53	00:11:56	Right. And the bullets from the Camaro's trunk?
150	00:11:56	00:11:57	A-ha.
151	00:11:57	00:11:58	Pre-fragmented ammo.
152	00:11:58	00:12:00	Now they're unique.
153	00:12:00	00:12:02	Exemplar's under the magnifier.
154	00:12:02	00:12:06	Copper jacket contains lead shot sealed with a clear epoxy plug.
155	00:12:06	00:12:08	I've never seen anything like that.
156	00:12:08	00:12:12	It's designed to enter a target, but not exit.
157	00:12:15	00:12:17	Penetration, not perforation.
158	00:12:17	00:12:19	Why?
159	00:12:19	00:12:21	Well, say you're on a commercial flight.
160	00:12:21	00:12:23	Plane gets hijacked.
161	00:12:23	00:12:26	US Air Marshal needs to take down the hijacker...
162	00:12:26	00:12:27	But not the plane.
163	00:12:27	00:12:31	Nowadays, MagSafes are sold commercially, but there's really not much of a market.
164	00:12:32	00:12:35	So chances are, your driver's a Federal Air Marshal.
165	00:12:38	00:12:40	It's a match.
166	00:12:40	00:12:43	Print on the hot tub dial was Sam Hopkins.
167	00:12:44	00:12:45	Rueben's manager?
168	00:12:45	00:12:47	Amelia was butt-naked in the hot tub.
169	00:12:47	00:12:49	What was he doing in her room tweaking dials?
170	00:12:49	00:12:50	While her husband's onstage?
171	00:12:51	00:12:53	Spectroscopy just got back.
172	00:12:53	00:12:56	Hydrofluoric acid in her system.
173	00:12:56	00:12:57	Isn't that an industrial solvent?
174	00:12:57	00:12:59	High-powered stuff.
175	00:12:59	00:13:05	Mainly used to remove rust, clean glass, brighten aluminum, dissolve silicas... and commit murder.
176	00:13:05	00:13:06	She was poisoned.
177	00:13:06	00:13:09	That would explain her heart attack.
178	00:13:09	00:13:10	You're killing me, Jimmy.
179	00:13:10	00:13:12	You're killing me.
180	00:13:12	00:13:13	All night the spotlight was off.
181	00:13:13	00:13:14	Way too hot on his face.
182	00:13:14	00:13:15	It's too hot on me right now.
183	00:13:16	00:13:17	They guy's not Wayne Newton, all right?
184	00:13:17	00:13:19	Can you see it on my face, Jim?
185	00:13:19	00:13:20	I need... Jimmy.
186	00:13:20	00:13:24	Thank... I need a cast shadow on him for all the love songs.
187	00:13:24	00:13:26	Mr. Hopkins, could you answer the question, please.
188	00:13:26	00:13:28	Sorry.
189	00:13:28	00:13:29	Yes, I was in Amelia's room.
190	00:13:29	00:13:30	I'm in there all the time.
191	00:13:30	00:13:31	We're like family.
192	00:13:31	00:13:32	We know you were close.
193	00:13:32	00:13:35	Do you always turn on the hot tub for her?
194	00:13:35	00:13:38	I represent one of the biggest headliners in town.
195	00:13:39	00:13:42	Manager, marriage counselor, confidante.
196	00:13:42	00:13:44	I kept Myles happy by keeping her happy.
197	00:13:44	00:13:48	Amelia, anything else I can get for you?
198	00:13:49	00:13:51	Look, sweetheart.
199	00:13:51	00:13:53	Here's how this works.
200	00:13:53	00:13:57	You give him his space, he sings his heart out.
201	00:13:57	00:13:59	Honey, we all prosper.
202	00:13:59	00:14:04	Let me set up a dinner for you two-- quiet, alone-- after the show.
203	00:14:04	00:14:05	No work.
204	00:14:05	00:14:07	Never happen.
205	00:14:07	00:14:09	Relax.
206	00:14:09	00:14:10	Give me an hour.
207	00:14:14	00:14:19	But you must admit, the boss' wife, naked in a hot tub, looks kind of funky.
208	00:14:19	00:14:20	Look at me.
209	00:14:20	00:14:22	Do I look like a threat?
210	00:14:22	00:14:25	The reason I've succeeded in this business, I don't squat where I eat, you know what I mean?
211	00:14:25	00:14:27	All right, let's talk about drinking.
212	00:14:27	00:14:28	There was a bottle of wine found near the tub.
213	00:14:28	00:14:30	Did you have a drink with her?
214	00:14:30	00:14:31	No. Never.
215	00:14:31	00:14:32	I don't touch it.
216	00:14:32	00:14:33	I'm on call 24/7.
217	00:14:33	00:14:36	Myles can pick up the phone, have me do anything, anytime.
218	00:14:36	00:14:38	Fly to L.A., pick someone up at the airport.
219	00:14:38	00:14:40	So, you'd do just about anything for him then?
220	00:14:40	00:14:41	When it comes to Myles, yeah.
221	00:14:41	00:14:43	What's this all about?
222	00:14:43	00:14:45	Mr. Hopkins, Amelia didn't drown.
223	00:14:45	00:14:46	She was poisoned.
224	00:14:46	00:14:48	Poisoned? By who?
225	00:14:48	00:14:50	That's what we're trying to find out.
226	00:14:50	00:14:54	According to the DMV, the Camaro was one of yours, is that right?
227	00:14:54	00:14:56	Yeah, it was rented to an Adam Watson.
228	00:14:56	00:14:57	Waived insurance.
229	00:14:58	00:14:59	Government discount.
230	00:14:59	00:15:03	Well, we have reason to believe Mr. Watson was a US Air Marshal.
231	00:15:03	00:15:05	Right. How could I forget him?
232	00:15:05	00:15:08	He threw it in my face when I told him we were out of compacts.
233	00:15:08	00:15:10	I'm a US Air Marshal, okay?
234	00:15:10	00:15:12	I travel for a living.
235	00:15:12	00:15:13	I don't need this crap.
236	00:15:13	00:15:15	But you found him a car.
237	00:15:15	00:15:19	I'll put you in a full-size and won't charge you for the difference.
238	00:15:19	00:15:20	No, forget it. I'll take the Camaro.
239	00:15:20	00:15:22	What time was that?
240	00:15:22	00:15:24	31 p.m.
241	00:15:24	00:15:27	Mr. Watson drove out nine minutes later.
242	00:15:27	00:15:29	Thanks a lot.
243	00:15:29	00:15:31	Guy worked for Homeland Security.
244	00:15:31	00:15:33	You think maybe some terrorist blew him up?
245	00:15:33	00:15:36	You'll be the first to know.
246	00:15:37	00:15:39	Well, it's been confirmed.
247	00:15:39	00:15:43	The driver, Adam Watson, was a Federal Air Marshal.
248	00:15:43	00:15:45	So, one of us needs to call the sheriff.
249	00:15:45	00:15:47	I'll flip you for it.
250	00:15:47	00:15:50	Well, before we make that call, what time did the Air Marshal drive off the lot?
251	00:15:51	00:15:53	40. Why?
252	00:15:53	00:15:56	Well, the bomb went off 30 minutes later.
253	00:15:56	00:15:58	It takes that long to get from here to the Orpheus.
254	00:15:58	00:16:01	So you're saying the bomb was already in the car when he drove out?
255	00:16:01	00:16:03	Well, that can't be.
256	00:16:03	00:16:08	According to the manager, the Camaro was only in the lot for, uh, nine minutes.
257	00:16:08	00:16:11	Well, it takes longer than that to hard-wire a bomb.
258	00:16:11	00:16:15	Which can only mean that the bomb was already in the car when it was returned.
259	00:16:15	00:16:18	So, who rented the car before him?
260	00:16:18	00:16:20	Roger Dunbar! Open up!
261	00:16:20	00:16:21	Las Vegas Police!
262	00:16:28	00:16:30	Clear.
263	00:16:30	00:16:31	Stand down.
264	00:16:31	00:16:33	Good job, guys.
265	00:16:34	00:16:36	Okay, well.
266	00:16:37	00:16:40	This guy was obviously on a week-to-week lease.
267	00:16:48	00:16:50	Left some clothes behind...
268	00:16:50	00:16:52	and a paper shredder.
269	00:16:58	00:17:00	No sign of any bomb-making material.
270	00:17:00	00:17:01	I'll go check the garage.
271	00:17:44	00:17:51	Dr. Amerian, 4 Oh, today.
272	00:17:51	00:17:53	I'll make an appointment.
273	00:17:56	00:17:59	You drag me out of my dentist's office.
274	00:17:59	00:18:01	You throw me in a squad car.
275	00:18:01	00:18:04	Now you're accusing me of planting a car bomb?
276	00:18:04	00:18:07	Mr. Dunbar, you rented a Camaro from Thrift Rite Rental.
277	00:18:07	00:18:10	30 p.m.
278	00:18:10	00:18:12	It blew up a half an hour later in front of the Orpheus.
279	00:18:12	00:18:14	It's all over the news.
280	00:18:14	00:18:16	That was my Camaro?
281	00:18:16	00:18:18	Yes.
282	00:18:18	00:18:19	But this is crazy.
283	00:18:19	00:18:21	So, what happened?
284	00:18:21	00:18:23	You have a beef with the rental car company?
285	00:18:23	00:18:26	No. I-I get double miles.
286	00:18:26	00:18:27	I'm a Premier Card member.
287	00:18:27	00:18:29	Oh, I'm sure you are.
288	00:18:29	00:18:33	You know what, I'm not saying another word without an attorney.
289	00:18:33	00:18:35	That's your right, Mr. Dunbar.
290	00:18:37	00:18:38	Warrant for your clothes.
291	00:18:40	00:18:42	Strip.
292	00:18:42	00:18:44	Everything in the bag.
293	00:19:33	00:19:35	ID'd the explosive.
294	00:19:36	00:19:37	Ammonium perchlorate.
295	00:19:37	00:19:38	Yeah, rocket fuel.
296	00:19:38	00:19:42	GCMS picked up the other half of the equation-- gasoline.
297	00:19:42	00:19:46	Combination of the two creates an unstable mass.
298	00:19:46	00:19:48	Both shock- and friction-sensitive.
299	00:19:48	00:19:52	Ammonium perchlorate's available at any chemical supply store.
300	00:19:52	00:19:54	You can gas up on every corner.
301	00:19:54	00:19:56	Anyone could've made this bomb.
302	00:19:58	00:20:01	Sheriff?
303	00:20:01	00:20:03	What can we do for you?
304	00:20:03	00:20:04	Need a little clarification.
305	00:20:04	00:20:07	I know Captain Brass has a suspect in custody.
306	00:20:07	00:20:12	Where it get a little hazy for me, is I'm not getting his connection to the Air Marshal.
307	00:20:12	00:20:16	Well, it's entirely possible that Mr. Watson was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
308	00:20:16	00:20:20	Another thing, you said that the switch was a digital clock.
309	00:20:20	00:20:24	The bomb had been set to go off at a designated time, right?
310	00:20:24	00:20:26	How do we get a wrong time?
311	00:20:26	00:20:28	I can answer that, too.
312	00:20:28	00:20:29	Take a look.
313	00:20:36	00:20:38	Short in the wire.
314	00:20:38	00:20:41	Compromised the timing device.
315	00:20:41	00:20:42	Made the bomb unpredictable.
316	00:20:42	00:20:45	We may never know when that bomb was supposed to explode.
317	00:20:47	00:20:49	I got your page.
318	00:20:50	00:20:52	You'd be a good maitre d'.
319	00:20:52	00:20:54	Checking glassware for spots?
320	00:20:54	00:20:56	You know, a hot tub is just like a dishwasher.
321	00:20:56	00:20:58	Washes away all of the impurities.
322	00:20:58	00:21:00	Including hydrofluoric acid, huh?
323	00:21:02	00:21:03	'93 Pinot.
324	00:21:04	00:21:06	Either it was a bad year for wine or a bad year for Amelia.
325	00:21:07	00:21:10	I found trace amounts of hydrofluoric acid in the vino.
326	00:21:10	00:21:12	So, somebody did spike the wine.
327	00:21:12	00:21:14	Oui.
328	00:21:14	00:21:16	We just want to know what happened the other night.
329	00:21:16	00:21:17	Did you open the bottle for her?
330	00:21:17	00:21:18	Hey, Amelia requested me.
331	00:21:18	00:21:19	I was up there every night.
332	00:21:20	00:21:21	I hooked her up.
333	00:21:21	00:21:23	And she wasn't drinking no Italian rotgut either.
334	00:21:23	00:21:26	She was ordering '93 Pinot from Russian River Valley.
335	00:21:26	00:21:28	That's 350 a bottle, 20% delivery charge.
336	00:21:28	00:21:30	You do the math.
337	00:21:30	00:21:31	Was anyone there with her?
338	00:21:31	00:21:32	No.
339	00:21:32	00:21:33	What about Sam Hopkins?
340	00:21:34	00:21:35	No, that mutt wasn't there.
341	00:21:35	00:21:36	Mutt?
342	00:21:36	00:21:37	Yeah, that manager scumbag.
343	00:21:37	00:21:39	You bring a bottle of wine when he's there, forget about it.
344	00:21:39	00:21:41	He signs for the bill and stiff city.
345	00:21:41	00:21:44	Now, when the Prince of Soul is there, that's a different story.
346	00:21:44	00:21:45	He'd give you $500 just to get lost.
347	00:21:45	00:21:47	But you didn't see Myles the other night?
348	00:21:47	00:21:48	Yeah, I saw him for a sec.
349	00:21:48	00:21:49	He came in between shows.
350	00:21:49	00:21:50	He showed me the door.
351	00:21:55	00:21:55	Whoa, whoa, whoa. My man.
352	00:21:55	00:22:01	There's only one man who practices chivalry around here, and it ain't you, Ducky.
353	00:22:04	00:22:07	Hey, I could tell they were in love, you know?
354	00:22:07	00:22:08	But he was never around.
355	00:22:08	00:22:10	I mean, I felt bad for Amelia.
356	00:22:10	00:22:12	She'd have me up three, four times a night.
357	00:22:12	00:22:13	You forgot the fork.
358	00:22:14	00:22:15	Can you bring some salt? How about some ice?
359	00:22:15	00:22:20	If you ask me, I'd say she was lonely.
360	00:22:20	00:22:22	Did you ever see them fight?
361	00:22:22	00:22:23	No, but I heard 'em.
362	00:22:23	00:22:26	And I'm sure 2202 and 2206 heard 'em, too.
363	00:22:26	00:22:29	Hey, but I don't bite the hand that feeds me.
364	00:22:29	00:22:32	Thanks.
365	00:22:45	00:22:47	There was rocket fuel in the bomb and rocket fuel on your T-shirt.
366	00:22:49	00:22:51	That you need to explain.
367	00:22:51	00:22:58	Well, I'm not really sure, but my son, he's got this science project due.
368	00:22:58	00:23:01	You're right, I'm not supposed to help, but, really, all the parents do.
369	00:23:02	00:23:04	We made a volcano.
370	00:23:04	00:23:08	Spilled some of the chemicals.
371	00:23:13	00:23:15	We've been to your apartment.
372	00:23:15	00:23:17	What volcano? What kid?
373	00:23:17	00:23:18	Timmy. Third grade.
374	00:23:18	00:23:19	Mesquite Elementary.
375	00:23:19	00:23:20	You're divorced?
376	00:23:20	00:23:22	No.
377	00:23:22	00:23:30	No, well, look, here's the situation is the family, they live in Mesquite, and I'm there on the weekends.
378	00:23:30	00:23:31	And during the week?
379	00:23:31	00:23:35	I-I'm in sales, so I travel all over the country.
380	00:23:35	00:23:37	Which is why he rents a car when he's in town.
381	00:23:37	00:23:38	It's cheaper than leasing.
382	00:23:38	00:23:40	Cheaper.
383	00:23:40	00:23:43	All right, but it still doesn't explain the empty apartment.
384	00:23:43	00:23:46	Look, I... like being married.
385	00:23:47	00:23:56	I... love my wife, my kid, but... I need my space.
386	00:23:56	00:24:03	I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, so I just tell them that I'm out of town even when I'm not.
387	00:24:03	00:24:07	We're going to need your home address.
388	00:24:07	00:24:08	No, look...
389	00:24:08	00:24:10	I'm begging you.
390	00:24:10	00:24:13	Please don't blow things for me with the wife.
391	00:24:17	00:24:19	Mom, what's going on?
392	00:24:20	00:24:22	I don't understand.
393	00:24:22	00:24:25	Mrs. Dunbar, could you and your son wait outside, please?
394	00:24:25	00:24:26	Ma'am, come with me.
395	00:24:26	00:24:28	I'll fill you in.
396	00:24:55	00:24:58	Catherine, there is a volcano on the table.
397	00:25:05	00:25:08	Aluminum powder.
398	00:25:08	00:25:11	Polyvinylbutadiene.
399	00:25:15	00:25:17	Ammonium perchlorate.
400	00:25:17	00:25:21	The three ingredients to make lava flow.
401	00:25:21	00:25:25	In fifth grade, I built one of these as my science fair project.
402	00:25:25	00:25:26	It was awesome.
403	00:25:26	00:25:28	First place should've been mine.
404	00:25:28	00:25:34	But they ended up giving it to this kid with some lame red ant colony.
405	00:25:35	00:25:37	That was you.
406	00:25:37	00:25:38	Yeah, only my ants were Black Argentinians.
407	00:25:39	00:25:40	Uh-huh.
408	00:25:40	00:25:43	I learned at a very early age that the bugs always win.
409	00:25:43	00:25:45	Right.
410	00:25:47	00:25:50	Trust me, Roger didn't build a bomb.
411	00:25:50	00:25:52	I love my husband, but he's inept.
412	00:25:52	00:25:55	Just last week, the hose bib cracked.
413	00:25:55	00:25:56	Front yard was a river.
414	00:25:57	00:25:59	Roger was helpless till I got home.
415	00:25:59	00:26:00	Well, what about that volcano?
416	00:26:00	00:26:04	Your husband said that he helped your son build it.
417	00:26:04	00:26:05	He watched.
418	00:26:05	00:26:07	I'm a teacher.
419	00:26:07	00:26:09	Timmy knows which parent to go to for help.
420	00:26:09	00:26:13	Mrs. Dunbar, your husband told us that he was in sales.
421	00:26:15	00:26:16	He's with the State Department.
422	00:26:16	00:26:21	You know, all that sensitive government stuff.
423	00:26:21	00:26:23	Keeps him on the road.
424	00:26:23	00:26:24	He doesn't say much about it.
425	00:26:24	00:26:29	As far as you know, has he talked about his job with anyone else?
426	00:26:29	00:26:31	Any other family members? Friends?
427	00:26:31	00:26:32	His parents are dead.
428	00:26:32	00:26:33	Roger's an only child.
429	00:26:33	00:26:37	He doesn't have time for friends.
430	00:26:37	00:26:40	There was this one night, years ago.
431	00:26:40	00:26:43	We were both a little drunk and...
432	00:26:43	00:26:47	Roger confessed he was CIA.
433	00:26:54	00:26:57	Hey, I made one of those in third grade.
434	00:26:57	00:27:00	Science fair.
435	00:27:00	00:27:01	Should have won, too.
436	00:27:01	00:27:02	Got to let it go, Nick.
437	00:27:03	00:27:06	Bomb end-cap with tool marks.
438	00:27:06	00:27:11	Given the orientation and spread of the marks, consistent with pliers, vise-grips.
439	00:27:11	00:27:14	There were no vise-grips in the Dunbars' toolbox.
440	00:27:14	00:27:19	But given that the bomb and the volcano were similarly constructed...
441	00:27:19	00:27:22	We can compare the tool marks on both end-caps.
442	00:27:22	00:27:25	Doesn't matter what you make; it's what you make it with.
443	00:27:35	00:27:36	Not even close.
444	00:27:36	00:27:37	Mm-mm.
445	00:27:37	00:27:43	So, whatever tool made the volcano did not make the bomb.
446	00:27:43	00:27:48	Okay, I reconstructed the contents of the paper shredder.
447	00:27:48	00:27:49	Five bills.
448	00:27:49	00:27:50	All in Roger Dunbar's name.
449	00:27:50	00:27:53	Addressed to 2175 La Pressa.
450	00:27:53	00:27:56	Mm-hmm. His apartment.
451	00:27:56	00:27:58	Okay, top two are credit card bills.
452	00:27:58	00:27:59	Both VISA.
453	00:27:59	00:28:01	Separate accounts.
454	00:28:01	00:28:03	Roger A. Dunbar.
455	00:28:03	00:28:05	Roger B. Dunbar.
456	00:28:05	00:28:07	That's an easy way to separate out expenses.
457	00:28:07	00:28:09	Check out the gas bills.
458	00:28:09	00:28:10	Three different meters.
459	00:28:11	00:28:14	2175 La Pressa.
460	00:28:14	00:28:17	822 Devon, Mesquite.
461	00:28:17	00:28:20	1845 Galewood, Henderson.
462	00:28:20	00:28:25	Hey, got the DNA results back from that bloody Band-Aid that Grissom found at Dunbar's apartment.
463	00:28:25	00:28:27	Compared it to his DNA. Not a match.
464	00:28:27	00:28:29	But I did find seven alleles in common.
465	00:28:29	00:28:31	His son.
466	00:28:31	00:28:32	No. It's female.
467	00:28:32	00:28:34	Mother, sister, daughter.
468	00:28:34	00:28:38	Well, according to his wife, his mother's deceased.
469	00:28:39	00:28:41	He's an only child.
470	00:28:41	00:28:43	So, that leaves a daughter.
471	00:28:43	00:28:46	Well, there's no way there was a kid at that apartment.
472	00:28:46	00:28:48	Well, maybe she was living in Henderson.
473	00:28:48	00:28:51	Forget secret agent.
474	00:28:51	00:28:54	Roger Dunbar was living a secret life.
475	00:29:03	00:29:04	Can I help you?
476	00:29:07	00:29:09	Good evening.
477	00:29:09	00:29:11	We're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
478	00:29:11	00:29:13	Oh, God.
479	00:29:13	00:29:16	Did something happen to my husband?
480	00:29:16	00:29:17	He was supposed to be home on Monday night.
481	00:29:17	00:29:19	I've been calling his cell. He's not at work.
482	00:29:20	00:29:22	Is this your husband?
483	00:29:22	00:29:23	Yes.
484	00:29:23	00:29:24	You're currently married to him?
485	00:29:25	00:29:26	Yes. What is going on?
486	00:29:28	00:29:31	Well, your husband is a suspect in a criminal investigation.
487	00:29:31	00:29:33	Currently, he's in police custody.
488	00:29:35	00:29:37	Mrs. Dunbar?
489	00:29:38	00:29:41	Do you have a daughter?
490	00:29:41	00:29:42	Amy.
491	00:29:42	00:29:46	Is she entered in the science fair?
492	00:29:47	00:29:49	You can't take it.
493	00:29:50	00:29:54	Amy, did you use this the tool to work on the inside of your volcano?
494	00:29:54	00:29:55	Yeah, my dad did.
495	00:29:55	00:29:57	He helped you build it?
496	00:29:57	00:29:59	Yeah.
497	00:29:59	00:30:00	I teach yoga.
498	00:30:00	00:30:02	I have no idea how this works.
499	00:30:02	00:30:04	It was all Roger.
500	00:30:04	00:30:06	When's your science fair?
501	00:30:06	00:30:07	Friday.
502	00:30:08	00:30:12	Well, we'll do our best to get this back to you by Friday, okay?
503	00:30:12	00:30:13	Okay.
504	00:30:15	00:30:17	Which side do you want?
505	00:30:17	00:30:19	I'll take the west wing.
506	00:30:19	00:30:22	It's a nice place.
507	00:30:22	00:30:23	Uh-huh.
508	00:30:30	00:30:35	You could record a whole album in this studio.
509	00:30:35	00:30:37	This guy's got it made.
510	00:30:38	00:30:41	The life of a celebrity.
511	00:30:55	00:30:58	I don't know, I think it sounds kind of isolating, living in a fishbowl.
512	00:30:58	00:30:59	Wouldn't be isolated.
513	00:30:59	00:31:03	You'd have a butler, a maid service, laundry service.
514	00:31:04	00:31:06	Sheet music.
515	00:31:06	00:31:08	Guy writes his own stuff.
516	00:31:13	00:31:15	Dishwashing gloves.
517	00:31:15	00:31:18	Dry erase markers.
518	00:31:18	00:31:21	Slate Industrial Glass Cleaner.
519	00:31:21	00:31:25	The ingredients-- distilled water and hydrofluoric acid.
520	00:31:27	00:31:29	Fatal if swallowed.
521	00:31:32	00:31:36	You're sure you want to waive your right to an attorney?
522	00:31:36	00:31:39	I got nothin' to hide.
523	00:31:39	00:31:41	Do you recognize this product?
524	00:31:43	00:31:45	Yeah.
525	00:31:45	00:31:46	I use it to clean my windows.
526	00:31:46	00:31:49	Don't you have a maid or someone to do that for you?
527	00:31:49	00:31:51	I write songs late at night.
528	00:31:51	00:31:53	Windows are my chalkboard.
529	00:32:00	00:32:01	Mr. Rueben...
530	00:32:02	00:32:03	your wife was poisoned.
531	00:32:04	00:32:06	We suspect window cleaner was slipped into her wine.
532	00:32:07	00:32:07	It can't be.
533	00:32:08	00:32:08	I was there.
534	00:32:09	00:32:10	I opened that wine.
535	00:32:10	00:32:12	Did you have a fight?
536	00:32:12	00:32:13	Not lately.
537	00:32:13	00:32:15	But you have had fights in the past.
538	00:32:16	00:32:17	Who doesn't?
539	00:32:17	00:32:23	I mean, fighting, loving, laughing... it all comes from the same place, man.
540	00:32:23	00:32:24	It's passion.
541	00:32:24	00:32:27	And we loved each other passionately.
542	00:32:31	00:32:34	When we met, it was fate.
543	00:32:34	00:32:36	But you know what I need right now?
544	00:32:36	00:32:37	I need a woman.
545	00:32:37	00:32:41	I need a woman to come up here and be my inspiration.
546	00:32:42	00:32:43	You, baby.
547	00:32:43	00:32:45	Second row. Come on up here.
548	00:33:02	00:33:04	I was looking for love.
549	00:33:04	00:33:07	She was looking for the same thing.
550	00:33:07	00:33:09	She loved my music.
551	00:33:11	00:33:13	I loved her smile.
552	00:33:13	00:33:17	It's hard being on top, you know?
553	00:33:18	00:33:20	I mean, everybody loves you.
554	00:33:20	00:33:22	Wants their piece.
555	00:33:24	00:33:26	That's why we fought.
556	00:33:26	00:33:28	The time.
557	00:33:31	00:33:34	She knew she could never have me to herself.
558	00:33:36	00:33:39	Look, I got sound check for the late show in an hour.
559	00:33:39	00:33:40	Can I go?
560	00:33:40	00:33:41	Sure.
561	00:33:44	00:33:47	We might want to talk to you later.
562	00:33:51	00:33:54	Wife's been dead less than 48 hours.
563	00:33:54	00:33:57	Well, there's a man who definitely has his priorities straight.
564	00:33:57	00:34:01	Okay, three people have admitted to being with Amelia the night that she died.
565	00:34:01	00:34:04	The room service waiter, Myles, and Myles's manager.
566	00:34:04	00:34:05	Room service guy's out.
567	00:34:05	00:34:07	He left before the cork was popped.
568	00:34:07	00:34:15	So, did Myles kill Amelia and the manager's covering for him or did the manager kill Amelia and Myles doesn't have a clue?
569	00:34:15	00:34:18	Bigamy is a Class D Felony.
570	00:34:18	00:34:23	If convicted, you could be sentenced from one to four years in prison, do you know that?
571	00:34:23	00:34:25	I'd just married Beth, when I met Debbie.
572	00:34:26	00:34:27	She was a student.
573	00:34:27	00:34:29	UNLV.
574	00:34:30	00:34:31	She got pregnant.
575	00:34:31	00:34:33	I did the right thing.
576	00:34:33	00:34:41	Ever since, it's been Monday through Friday with Debbie and weekends with Beth.
577	00:34:41	00:34:43	They both think I travel for a living.
578	00:34:43	00:34:47	I know I keep coming back to this, but, uh... I mean, I got to ask you.
579	00:34:47	00:34:49	What's with the empty apartment?
580	00:34:49	00:34:52	Do you have a girlfriend on the side as well?
581	00:34:52	00:34:53	No.
582	00:34:56	00:34:57	Just tell them the truth.
583	00:35:01	00:35:05	My life is really a balancing act.
584	00:35:05	00:35:09	Early on, I took Debbie to dinner and Beth saw it on a credit card statement.
585	00:35:09	00:35:17	So instead of a P.O. Box, I figured why not rent a cheap apartment, you know?
586	00:35:17	00:35:20	Have a night to myself once in a while.
587	00:35:20	00:35:25	We found a Band-Aid with your daughter Amy's blood at your apartment.
588	00:35:25	00:35:29	So, you bring your daughter there, but not your wives?
589	00:35:29	00:35:31	Oh, no. It's not like that.
590	00:35:32	00:35:34	You know how kids are.
591	00:35:34	00:35:35	Dad, take this.
592	00:35:35	00:35:37	It keeps falling off.
593	00:35:40	00:35:43	I emptied my pockets at the apartment.
594	00:35:43	00:35:49	Mr. Dunbar, we collected both of your children's volcanoes and supplies.
595	00:35:49	00:35:54	And we found a pair of pliers at your home in Henderson.
596	00:35:54	00:35:57	Those pliers were used to make both of the volcanoes.
597	00:35:57	00:35:58	That's right.
598	00:35:58	00:36:03	I needed pliers in Henderson, so I borrowed Beth's pliers from Mesquite.
599	00:36:03	00:36:04	There's no crime in that.
600	00:36:04	00:36:07	I'm just really confused.
601	00:36:07	00:36:14	Um... your wife, Beth, told us that you couldn't build a volcano to save your soul.
602	00:36:14	00:36:19	Yet your wife, Debbie, claims that it was all you that made your daughter's volcano.
603	00:36:19	00:36:20	So, what is it?
604	00:36:20	00:36:24	Well, I watched Beth when she made Timmy's volcano.
605	00:36:24	00:36:28	So, then when Amy had a science project, I knew the drill.
606	00:36:28	00:36:36	Now, granted, it wasn't as symmetrical as Beth's and the lava flow was a little anemic, but... Amy liked it.
607	00:36:36	00:36:38	When did you borrow those pliers?
608	00:36:38	00:36:39	I don't know.
609	00:36:39	00:36:41	Couple weeks ago.
610	00:36:41	00:36:42	Why?
611	00:36:42	00:36:45	You never returned them to your wife, Beth?
612	00:36:47	00:36:50	I've been meaning to do that.
613	00:36:55	00:36:58	Same characteristics. We got a match.
614	00:37:00	00:37:01	Take her in.
615	00:37:28	00:37:30	I got prints.
616	00:37:30	00:37:32	I've got burns.
617	00:37:32	00:37:34	You first.
618	00:37:34	00:37:35	Sam or Myles?
619	00:37:35	00:37:37	Amelia's.
620	00:37:44	00:37:45	Well, you're just in time.
621	00:37:45	00:37:46	She gets shipped in an hour.
622	00:37:46	00:37:48	This should just take a second.
623	00:37:48	00:37:50	Could you give me her right hand, please?
624	00:37:57	00:37:58	Three acid burns.
625	00:37:58	00:38:01	This is not a murder.
626	00:38:01	00:38:02	It's a suicide.
627	00:38:32	00:38:35	I knew she wasn't happy.
628	00:38:35	00:38:37	I guess I just didn't pay attention.
629	00:38:37	00:38:39	You shouldn't blame yourself for this.
630	00:38:39	00:38:41	Shouldn't I? Why shouldn't I?
631	00:38:41	00:38:45	I spend most of my time making them happy.
632	00:38:45	00:38:46	I never...
633	00:38:46	00:38:48	I never took the time to make her happy.
634	00:38:48	00:38:51	Amelia, Amelia!
635	00:38:53	00:38:54	What do you want to do, kid?
636	00:39:00	00:39:02	The show must go on, right?
637	00:39:02	00:39:04	It's your call.
638	00:39:47	00:39:50	We found these pliers in your car's glove box.
639	00:39:51	00:39:54	You used them to fix the faucet.
640	00:39:54	00:39:56	And to...
641	00:39:56	00:39:58	make a bomb.
642	00:40:00	00:40:01	Mrs. Dunbar...
643	00:40:01	00:40:05	how long have you known about Roger's double life?
644	00:40:06	00:40:10	His other wife's name is Debbie.
645	00:40:10	00:40:13	Once or twice a year he'd call me by that name.
646	00:40:13	00:40:14	I ignored it.
647	00:40:14	00:40:18	It's very difficult for two people to live a lie, let alone three.
648	00:40:18	00:40:21	Look, when Roger and I were together, he was a good husband.
649	00:40:21	00:40:22	Terrific father.
650	00:40:22	00:40:29	It was almost like being in a state of suspended honeymoon.
651	00:40:29	00:40:31	Really?
652	00:40:31	00:40:33	So what changed?
653	00:40:33	00:40:36	He asked me to get his dirty laundry out of the trunk of his car.
654	00:40:38	00:40:43	There was a plastic bag with all the makings of a volcano.
655	00:40:43	00:40:47	Including the stars I had hand-cut for my son.
656	00:40:50	00:40:56	I'd always suspected there was another woman, but never...
657	00:40:56	00:40:59	another family.
658	00:41:01	00:41:05	Two weeks ago Sunday, I followed him.
659	00:41:05	00:41:09	He, uh, dropped off his rental car and walked to some apartment building.
660	00:41:09	00:41:17	Then he changed his clothes, and got into a nicer car, and drove out to Henderson.
661	00:41:17	00:41:20	Why didn't you just leave him? Turn him in?
662	00:41:22	00:41:24	He made a fool out of me.
663	00:41:25	00:41:27	A mockery of our life.
664	00:41:27	00:41:30	Mrs. Dunbar, you killed three innocent people.
665	00:41:30	00:41:34	That was never my intention.
666	00:41:34	00:41:37	30.
667	00:41:37	00:41:39	On his way to the airport.
668	00:41:41	00:41:43	Why a bomb?
669	00:41:43	00:41:47	It, it's not much harder to make a bomb than a volcano.
