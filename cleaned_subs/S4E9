0,00:00:06,00:00:09,MAN: Thank you. Have a good night.
1,00:00:09,00:00:12,"Eagles covered, bruh."
2,00:00:12,00:00:13,Cough up the 20.
3,00:00:13,00:00:14,"Man, backdoor touchdown."
4,00:00:14,00:00:15,"Man, kills you every time."
5,00:00:15,00:00:17,Ha-ha!
6,00:00:17,00:00:19,Alright no more martini's for you.
7,00:00:28,00:00:29,Welcome to the Orpheus.
8,00:00:29,00:00:31,You checking in or just donating?
9,00:00:31,00:00:33,"Checking in. Any bags, sir?"
10,00:00:33,00:00:36,I got this one. Grab the one in the trunk.
11,00:00:40,00:00:41,"(screaming, glass shattering)"
12,00:00:45,00:00:48,"(clamoring, screaming)"
13,00:00:48,00:00:51,(siren wails)
14,00:01:09,00:01:09,Car bomb.
15,00:01:10,00:01:11,Driver and valet are dead.
16,00:01:11,00:01:13,Another valet is critical.
17,00:01:13,00:01:15,Got at least a dozen injured.
18,00:01:15,00:01:16,I was having dinner here.
19,00:01:16,00:01:17,Was on my way out.
20,00:01:17,00:01:20,"It'd gone off a couple of seconds later, you'd be picking my badge up off the ground."
21,00:01:20,00:01:22,Thank God you're all right.
22,00:01:22,00:01:24,"Sheriff, did they, uh, sweep the area for secondaries?"
23,00:01:24,00:01:26,Bomb squad says it's all clear.
24,00:01:26,00:01:28,We'll photo-document the scene.
25,00:01:28,00:01:29,Overalls from all angles.
26,00:01:29,00:01:31,Aerials as well.
27,00:02:20,00:02:22,Guess it wasn't a sniper.
28,00:02:22,00:02:24,Fixed ammunition in the trunk.
29,00:02:24,00:02:28,"The gunpowder must have heated up, and the, uh, rounds cooked off."
30,00:02:29,00:02:32,(rapid gunfire)
31,00:02:32,00:02:36,I'm going to start marking the evidence.
32,00:02:36,00:02:42,"I believe the, uh, glass pressure traveled from the rear of the vehicle, through the front..."
33,00:02:44,00:02:48,...and evidently separated the driver's body at the ankles.
34,00:02:49,00:02:52,"David, we have body parts in the car."
35,00:02:52,00:02:54,I've been looking for the feet.
36,00:02:54,00:02:55,I found 'em.
37,00:02:55,00:02:57,We gotta ID the driver ASAP.
38,00:03:02,00:03:04,"Well, the VIN number's still attached."
39,00:03:04,00:03:05,Write that down.
40,00:03:05,00:03:06,Call in the DMV.
41,00:03:06,00:03:08,"Yes, sir."
42,00:03:35,00:03:37,"Sorry, Catherine."
43,00:03:37,00:03:40,Traffic's backed up all the way to the Strip.
44,00:03:40,00:03:42,Got a SIG-Sauer.
45,00:03:42,00:03:44,Probably the driver's.
46,00:03:44,00:03:45,I'll start bagging.
47,00:03:45,00:03:48,Gather the detritus and separate out the bomb components.
48,00:03:48,00:03:51,Okay.
49,00:03:53,00:03:55,(tires screech)
50,00:03:55,00:03:57,GRISSOM: Here's press.
51,00:03:57,00:03:59,You're on.
52,00:03:59,00:04:02,"Wish I could help, but, uh, I got a vehicle to process."
53,00:04:02,00:04:05,"Come on, Grissom-- a bomb goes off these days, they're going to assume it's a hit."
54,00:04:05,00:04:07,What are you thinking?
55,00:04:07,00:04:09,I'm not thinking. I'm just looking.
56,00:04:09,00:04:11,That's good.
57,00:04:11,00:04:13,Can I use that?
58,00:04:20,00:04:24,Amelia Rueben. 25.
59,00:04:24,00:04:27,She a guest?
60,00:04:27,00:04:29,Or a guest of a guest?
61,00:04:29,00:04:30,Myles Rueben's wife.
62,00:04:30,00:04:32,SIDLE: Who found her?
63,00:04:32,00:04:35,"About 40 minutes ago, a maid walked in for ""turn-down"" service."
64,00:04:35,00:04:37,Called hotel security.
65,00:04:37,00:04:39,Still on a timer.
66,00:04:41,00:04:45,Got a wine glass.
67,00:04:45,00:04:47,Does Myles know?
68,00:04:47,00:04:49,He's still onstage.
69,00:04:49,00:04:51,(audience cheering)
70,00:05:06,00:05:08,Got a wine bottle.
71,00:05:13,00:05:15,Almost empty.
72,00:05:22,00:05:23,Alcohol.
73,00:05:23,00:05:24,Hot tub.
74,00:05:24,00:05:26,A little bit too relaxed.
75,00:05:31,00:05:35,ROBBINS: Temperature of the spa water makes liver temp irrelevant.
76,00:05:35,00:05:39,"But given the redness of her eyes, I'd estimate she's been dead less than an hour."
77,00:06:00,00:06:03,BROWN: It just dawned on me what's Rueben's biggest hit was.
78,00:06:04,00:06:05,What's that?
79,00:06:05,00:06:25,"""Amelia."" I'll handle this when Myles breaks for the encore."
80,00:06:25,00:06:27,Been the kid's manager since '97.
81,00:06:29,00:06:30,I should be the one to tell him.
82,00:06:37,00:06:40,(cheering and applause)
83,00:06:44,00:06:45,"How was that, Sam? Sound good?"
84,00:06:45,00:06:47,"Great, Myles. The best."
85,00:06:47,00:06:48,What? What's wrong?
86,00:06:48,00:06:49,"I missed a high note, huh?"
87,00:06:49,00:06:50,Man...
88,00:06:50,00:06:52,"No, no, no. Everything sounded great."
89,00:06:52,00:06:56,"Listen, Myles, these are crime scene investigators."
90,00:06:56,00:06:58,"Myles, uh..."
91,00:06:58,00:07:00,there's been an accident.
92,00:07:00,00:07:01,An accident?
93,00:07:01,00:07:02,"What, is it my mother?"
94,00:07:02,00:07:03,Did-did something happen back East?
95,00:07:03,00:07:05,"No, no, no. Your mother's fine."
96,00:07:05,00:07:10,"Look, Myles, it's, uh..."
97,00:07:10,00:07:16,"Mr. Rueben, I'm very sorry to have to tell you this, but your wife is dead."
98,00:07:22,00:07:24,AUDIENCE (chanting): Amelia! Amelia!
99,00:07:27,00:07:30,(chanting continues)
100,00:07:30,00:07:33,"Turn the houselights up, Sam."
101,00:07:33,00:07:35,There's no encore tonight.
102,00:07:47,00:07:49,I heard about the bombing.
103,00:07:49,00:07:50,I'm here to help.
104,00:07:50,00:07:52,I located the seat of the explosion.
105,00:07:52,00:07:54,The bomb was attached to the fuel tank.
106,00:07:54,00:07:56,Gas-enhanced.
107,00:07:56,00:07:57,Bomber maximized his bang.
108,00:07:57,00:08:01,"You really want to help, climb under here and find the initiation switch."
109,00:08:20,00:08:23,SANDERS: Got a stray wire.
110,00:08:25,00:08:31,"Leading away from the gas tank, right into the center of the dash."
111,00:08:33,00:08:36,Nowhere near the loom.
112,00:08:41,00:08:44,GRISSOM: The digital clock was the switch.
113,00:08:47,00:08:49,It was time-activated.
114,00:08:49,00:08:50,What's next?
115,00:08:51,00:08:53,Nick has to reconstruct the bomb.
116,00:10:06,00:10:07,STOKES: It was a pipe bomb.
117,00:10:07,00:10:09,Initiated by a lightbulb filament.
118,00:10:10,00:10:11,Bomb was attached to the fuel tank.
119,00:10:11,00:10:16,There were still magnet and solder fragments attached to the pipe.
120,00:10:16,00:10:17,Did you find any kind of timing device?
121,00:10:18,00:10:20,Digital clock in the dash.
122,00:10:20,00:10:21,What about the type of explosive used?
123,00:10:22,00:10:23,Not yet.
124,00:10:23,00:10:26,I was about to analyze the chemical residue left on the bomb frags.
125,00:10:26,00:10:29,Be sure to do an organics and inorganics test.
126,00:10:29,00:10:31,Will do.
127,00:10:31,00:10:34,So...
128,00:10:34,00:10:35,what does it all mean?
129,00:10:38,00:10:39,What doeswhatall mean?
130,00:10:39,00:10:41,"Don't play dumb with me, Gil."
131,00:10:41,00:10:43,Explosions lead the news.
132,00:10:43,00:10:45,"I need to know who, and I need to know why."
133,00:10:45,00:10:48,"Well, the evidence is only teaching us about the bomb, not the bomber."
134,00:10:48,00:10:49,What about a signature?
135,00:10:49,00:10:52,"Is there anything distinct, unusual about this particular bomb?"
136,00:10:52,00:10:55,No.
137,00:10:55,00:10:57,Nothing.
138,00:11:03,00:11:05,ROBBINS: Amelia Rueben didn't drown.
139,00:11:05,00:11:10,"If she had, there'd be fluid in her nasal sinuses."
140,00:11:12,00:11:14,Clear as a bell.
141,00:11:15,00:11:17,What was the cause of death?
142,00:11:17,00:11:18,Cardiac arrest.
143,00:11:19,00:11:21,She was only 25.
144,00:11:22,00:11:23,Was there some kind of defect?
145,00:11:23,00:11:25,"No, her heart was in perfect condition."
146,00:11:25,00:11:27,"In fact, I have it over here."
147,00:11:29,00:11:31,See the myocardium?
148,00:11:31,00:11:34,"There's no evidence of hemorrhage, infarct or scarring."
149,00:11:34,00:11:36,No coronary occlusions.
150,00:11:36,00:11:37,I can't explain it.
151,00:11:37,00:11:39,It's like a mystery of the heart.
152,00:11:42,00:11:46,"DAWSON: So, that SIG-Sauer you found..."
153,00:11:46,00:11:48,Yes. Relatively nondescript.
154,00:11:48,00:11:50,"Uh, the blue stuff, sent a sample to Trace."
155,00:11:50,00:11:53,Pretty sure it's from some sort of bag that melted in the explosion.
156,00:11:53,00:11:56,Right. And the bullets from the Camaro's trunk?
157,00:11:56,00:11:57,A-ha.
158,00:11:57,00:11:58,Pre-fragmented ammo.
159,00:11:58,00:12:00,Now they're unique.
160,00:12:00,00:12:02,Exemplar's under the magnifier.
161,00:12:02,00:12:06,Copper jacket contains lead shot sealed with a clear epoxy plug.
162,00:12:06,00:12:08,I've never seen anything like that.
163,00:12:08,00:12:12,"It's designed to enter a target, but not exit."
164,00:12:12,00:12:13,(gunshot)
165,00:12:13,00:12:15,(bullet impacts)
166,00:12:15,00:12:17,"Penetration, not perforation."
167,00:12:17,00:12:19,Why?
168,00:12:19,00:12:21,"Well, say you're on a commercial flight."
169,00:12:21,00:12:23,Plane gets hijacked.
170,00:12:23,00:12:26,US Air Marshal needs to take down the hijacker...
171,00:12:26,00:12:27,But not the plane.
172,00:12:27,00:12:31,"Nowadays, MagSafes are sold commercially, but there's really not much of a market."
173,00:12:32,00:12:35,"So chances are, your driver's a Federal Air Marshal."
174,00:12:36,00:12:38,(computer bleeps)
175,00:12:38,00:12:40,It's a match.
176,00:12:40,00:12:43,Print on the hot tub dial was Sam Hopkins.
177,00:12:44,00:12:45,Rueben's manager?
178,00:12:45,00:12:47,Amelia was butt-naked in the hot tub.
179,00:12:47,00:12:49,What was he doing in her room tweaking dials?
180,00:12:49,00:12:50,While her husband's onstage?
181,00:12:51,00:12:53,Spectroscopy just got back.
182,00:12:53,00:12:56,Hydrofluoric acid in her system.
183,00:12:56,00:12:57,Isn't that an industrial solvent?
184,00:12:57,00:12:59,High-powered stuff.
185,00:12:59,00:13:05,"Mainly used to remove rust, clean glass, brighten aluminum, dissolve silicas... and commit murder."
186,00:13:05,00:13:06,She was poisoned.
187,00:13:06,00:13:09,That would explain her heart attack.
188,00:13:09,00:13:10,"You're killing me, Jimmy."
189,00:13:10,00:13:12,You're killing me.
190,00:13:12,00:13:13,All night the spotlight was off.
191,00:13:13,00:13:14,Way too hot on his face.
192,00:13:14,00:13:15,It's too hot on me right now.
193,00:13:16,00:13:17,"They guy's not Wayne Newton, all right?"
194,00:13:17,00:13:19,"Can you see it on my face, Jim?"
195,00:13:19,00:13:20,I need... Jimmy.
196,00:13:20,00:13:24,Thank... I need a cast shadow on him for all the love songs.
197,00:13:24,00:13:26,"Mr. Hopkins, could you answer the question, please."
198,00:13:26,00:13:28,Sorry.
199,00:13:28,00:13:29,"Yes, I was in Amelia's room."
200,00:13:29,00:13:30,I'm in there all the time.
201,00:13:30,00:13:31,We're like family.
202,00:13:31,00:13:32,We know you were close.
203,00:13:32,00:13:35,Do you always turn on the hot tub for her?
204,00:13:35,00:13:38,I represent one of the biggest headliners in town.
205,00:13:38,00:13:42,"Wear a lot of hats: Manager, marriage counselor, confidante."
206,00:13:42,00:13:44,I kept Myles happy by keeping her happy.
207,00:13:44,00:13:48,"HOPKINS: Amelia, anything else I can get for you?"
208,00:13:49,00:13:51,"Look, sweetheart."
209,00:13:51,00:13:53,Here's how this works.
210,00:13:53,00:13:57,"You give him his space, he sings his heart out."
211,00:13:57,00:13:59,"Honey, we all prosper."
212,00:13:59,00:14:04,"Let me set up a dinner for you two-- quiet, alone-- after the show."
213,00:14:04,00:14:05,No work.
214,00:14:05,00:14:07,Never happen.
215,00:14:07,00:14:09,Relax.
216,00:14:09,00:14:10,Give me an hour.
217,00:14:14,00:14:19,"But you must admit, the boss' wife, naked in a hot tub, looks kind of funky."
218,00:14:19,00:14:20,Look at me.
219,00:14:20,00:14:22,Do I look like a threat?
220,00:14:22,00:14:25,"The reason I've succeeded in this business, I don't squat where I eat, you know what I mean?"
221,00:14:25,00:14:27,"All right, let's talk about drinking."
222,00:14:27,00:14:28,There was a bottle of wine found near the tub.
223,00:14:28,00:14:30,Did you have a drink with her?
224,00:14:30,00:14:31,No. Never.
225,00:14:31,00:14:32,I don't touch it.
226,00:14:32,00:14:33,I'm on call 24/7.
227,00:14:33,00:14:36,"Myles can pick up the phone, have me do anything, anytime."
228,00:14:36,00:14:38,"Fly to L.A., pick someone up at the airport."
229,00:14:38,00:14:40,"So, you'd do just about anything for him then?"
230,00:14:40,00:14:41,"When it comes to Myles, yeah."
231,00:14:41,00:14:43,What's this all about?
232,00:14:43,00:14:45,"Mr. Hopkins, Amelia didn't drown."
233,00:14:45,00:14:46,She was poisoned.
234,00:14:46,00:14:48,Poisoned? By who?
235,00:14:48,00:14:50,That's what we're trying to find out.
236,00:14:50,00:14:54,"BRASS: According to the DMV, the Camaro was one of yours, is that right?"
237,00:14:54,00:14:56,"Yeah, it was rented to an Adam Watson."
238,00:14:56,00:14:57,Waived insurance.
239,00:14:58,00:14:59,Government discount.
240,00:14:59,00:15:03,"Well, we have reason to believe Mr. Watson was a US Air Marshal."
241,00:15:03,00:15:05,Right. How could I forget him?
242,00:15:05,00:15:08,He threw it in my face when I told him we were out of compacts.
243,00:15:08,00:15:10,"I'm a US Air Marshal, okay?"
244,00:15:10,00:15:12,I travel for a living.
245,00:15:12,00:15:13,I don't need this crap.
246,00:15:13,00:15:15,But you found him a car.
247,00:15:15,00:15:19,I'll put you in a full-size and won't charge you for the difference.
248,00:15:19,00:15:20,"No, forget it. I'll take the Camaro."
249,00:15:20,00:15:22,What time was that?
250,00:15:22,00:15:24,Vehicle entered the lot at 9:31 p.m.
251,00:15:24,00:15:27,Mr. Watson drove out nine minutes later.
252,00:15:27,00:15:29,Thanks a lot.
253,00:15:29,00:15:31,Guy worked for Homeland Security.
254,00:15:31,00:15:33,You think maybe some terrorist blew him up?
255,00:15:33,00:15:36,You'll be the first to know.
256,00:15:37,00:15:39,"Well, it's been confirmed."
257,00:15:39,00:15:43,"The driver, Adam Watson, was a Federal Air Marshal."
258,00:15:43,00:15:45,"So, one of us needs to call the sheriff."
259,00:15:45,00:15:47,I'll flip you for it.
260,00:15:47,00:15:50,"Well, before we make that call, what time did the Air Marshal drive off the lot?"
261,00:15:51,00:15:53,9:40. Why?
262,00:15:53,00:15:56,"Well, the bomb went off 30 minutes later."
263,00:15:56,00:15:58,It takes that long to get from here to the Orpheus.
264,00:15:58,00:16:01,So you're saying the bomb was already in the car when he drove out?
265,00:16:01,00:16:03,"Well, that can't be."
266,00:16:03,00:16:08,"According to the manager, the Camaro was only in the lot for, uh, nine minutes."
267,00:16:08,00:16:11,"Well, it takes longer than that to hard-wire a bomb."
268,00:16:11,00:16:15,Which can only mean that the bomb was already in the car when it was returned.
269,00:16:15,00:16:18,"So, who rented the car before him?"
270,00:16:18,00:16:20,BRASS: Roger Dunbar! Open up!
271,00:16:20,00:16:21,Las Vegas Police!
272,00:16:28,00:16:30,Clear.
273,00:16:30,00:16:31,Stand down.
274,00:16:31,00:16:33,"Good job, guys."
275,00:16:34,00:16:36,"Okay, well."
276,00:16:37,00:16:40,This guy was obviously on a week-to-week lease.
277,00:16:48,00:16:50,WILLOWS: Left some clothes behind...
278,00:16:50,00:16:52,and a paper shredder.
279,00:16:58,00:17:00,No sign of any bomb-making material.
280,00:17:00,00:17:01,I'll go check the garage.
281,00:17:44,00:17:51,"WILLOWS: ""Dr. Amerian, 4:00 p.m."" Oh, today."
282,00:17:51,00:17:53,I'll make an appointment.
283,00:17:56,00:17:59,You drag me out of my dentist's office.
284,00:17:59,00:18:01,You throw me in a squad car.
285,00:18:01,00:18:04,Now you're accusing me of planting a car bomb?
286,00:18:04,00:18:07,"Mr. Dunbar, you rented a Camaro from Thrift Rite Rental."
287,00:18:07,00:18:10,"Returned it last night, 9:30 p.m."
288,00:18:10,00:18:12,It blew up a half an hour later in front of the Orpheus.
289,00:18:12,00:18:14,It's all over the news.
290,00:18:14,00:18:16,That was my Camaro?
291,00:18:16,00:18:18,Yes.
292,00:18:18,00:18:19,But this is crazy.
293,00:18:19,00:18:21,"So, what happened?"
294,00:18:21,00:18:23,You have a beef with the rental car company?
295,00:18:23,00:18:26,No. I-I get double miles.
296,00:18:26,00:18:27,I'm a Premier Card member.
297,00:18:27,00:18:29,"Oh, I'm sure you are."
298,00:18:29,00:18:33,"You know what, I'm not saying another word without an attorney."
299,00:18:33,00:18:35,"That's your right, Mr. Dunbar."
300,00:18:37,00:18:38,Warrant for your clothes.
301,00:18:40,00:18:42,Strip.
302,00:18:42,00:18:44,Everything in the bag.
303,00:19:33,00:19:35,ID'd the explosive.
304,00:19:36,00:19:37,Ammonium perchlorate.
305,00:19:37,00:19:38,"Yeah, rocket fuel."
306,00:19:38,00:19:42,GCMS picked up the other half of the equation-- gasoline.
307,00:19:42,00:19:46,Combination of the two creates an unstable mass.
308,00:19:46,00:19:48,Both shock- and friction-sensitive.
309,00:19:48,00:19:52,Ammonium perchlorate's available at any chemical supply store.
310,00:19:52,00:19:54,You can gas up on every corner.
311,00:19:54,00:19:56,Anyone could've made this bomb.
312,00:19:58,00:20:01,Sheriff?
313,00:20:01,00:20:03,What can we do for you?
314,00:20:03,00:20:04,Need a little clarification.
315,00:20:04,00:20:07,I know Captain Brass has a suspect in custody.
316,00:20:07,00:20:12,"Where it get a little hazy for me, is I'm not getting his connection to the Air Marshal."
317,00:20:12,00:20:16,"Well, it's entirely possible that Mr. Watson was just in the wrong place at the wrong time."
318,00:20:16,00:20:20,"Another thing, you said that the switch was a digital clock."
319,00:20:20,00:20:24,"The bomb had been set to go off at a designated time, right?"
320,00:20:24,00:20:26,How do we get a wrong time?
321,00:20:26,00:20:28,"I can answer that, too."
322,00:20:28,00:20:29,Take a look.
323,00:20:36,00:20:38,Short in the wire.
324,00:20:38,00:20:41,Compromised the timing device.
325,00:20:41,00:20:42,Made the bomb unpredictable.
326,00:20:42,00:20:45,We may never know when that bomb was supposed to explode.
327,00:20:47,00:20:49,I got your page.
328,00:20:50,00:20:52,You'd be a good maitre d'.
329,00:20:52,00:20:54,Checking glassware for spots?
330,00:20:54,00:20:56,"You know, a hot tub is just like a dishwasher."
331,00:20:56,00:20:58,Washes away all of the impurities.
332,00:20:58,00:21:00,"Including hydrofluoric acid, huh?"
333,00:21:02,00:21:03,'93 Pinot.
334,00:21:04,00:21:06,(French accent): Either it was a bad year for wine or a bad year for Amelia.
335,00:21:07,00:21:10,I found trace amounts of hydrofluoric acid in the vino.
336,00:21:10,00:21:12,"So, somebody did spike the wine."
337,00:21:12,00:21:14,Oui.
338,00:21:14,00:21:16,BROWN: We just want to know what happened the other night.
339,00:21:16,00:21:17,Did you open the bottle for her?
340,00:21:17,00:21:18,"MAN: Hey, Amelia requested me."
341,00:21:18,00:21:19,I was up there every night.
342,00:21:20,00:21:21,I hooked her up.
343,00:21:21,00:21:23,And she wasn't drinking no Italian rotgut either.
344,00:21:23,00:21:26,She was ordering '93 Pinot from Russian River Valley.
345,00:21:26,00:21:28,"That's 350 a bottle, 20% delivery charge."
346,00:21:28,00:21:30,You do the math.
347,00:21:30,00:21:31,Was anyone there with her?
348,00:21:31,00:21:32,No.
349,00:21:32,00:21:33,What about Sam Hopkins?
350,00:21:34,00:21:35,"No, that mutt wasn't there."
351,00:21:35,00:21:36,"""Mutt""?"
352,00:21:36,00:21:37,"Yeah, that manager scumbag."
353,00:21:37,00:21:39,"You bring a bottle of wine when he's there, forget about it."
354,00:21:39,00:21:41,He signs for the bill and stiff city.
355,00:21:41,00:21:44,"Now, when the Prince of Soul is there, that's a different story."
356,00:21:44,00:21:45,He'd give you $500 just to get lost.
357,00:21:45,00:21:47,But you didn't see Myles the other night?
358,00:21:47,00:21:48,"Yeah, I saw him for a sec."
359,00:21:48,00:21:49,He came in between shows.
360,00:21:49,00:21:50,He showed me the door.
361,00:21:55,00:21:55,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. My man."
362,00:21:55,00:22:01,"There's only one man who practices chivalry around here, and it ain't you, Ducky."
363,00:22:04,00:22:07,"Hey, I could tell they were in love, you know?"
364,00:22:07,00:22:08,But he was never around.
365,00:22:08,00:22:10,"I mean, I felt bad for Amelia."
366,00:22:10,00:22:12,"She'd have me up three, four times a night."
367,00:22:12,00:22:13,"""You forgot the fork."
368,00:22:14,00:22:20,"Can you bring some salt? How about some ice?"" If you ask me, I'd say she was lonely."
369,00:22:20,00:22:22,Did you ever see them fight?
370,00:22:22,00:22:23,"No, but I heard 'em."
371,00:22:23,00:22:26,"And I'm sure 2202 and 2206 heard 'em, too."
372,00:22:26,00:22:29,"Hey, but I don't bite the hand that feeds me."
373,00:22:29,00:22:32,Thanks.
374,00:22:45,00:22:47,There was rocket fuel in the bomb and rocket fuel on your T-shirt.
375,00:22:49,00:22:51,That you need to explain.
376,00:22:51,00:22:58,"Well, I'm not really sure, but my son, he's got this science project due."
377,00:22:58,00:23:01,"You're right, I'm not supposed to help, but, really, all the parents do."
378,00:23:02,00:23:04,We made a volcano.
379,00:23:04,00:23:08,Spilled some of the chemicals.
380,00:23:08,00:23:10,(sizzling)
381,00:23:11,00:23:12,(gurgling)
382,00:23:12,00:23:13,(clatters)
383,00:23:13,00:23:15,We've been to your apartment.
384,00:23:15,00:23:17,What volcano? What kid?
385,00:23:17,00:23:18,Timmy. Third grade.
386,00:23:18,00:23:19,Mesquite Elementary.
387,00:23:19,00:23:20,You're divorced?
388,00:23:20,00:23:22,No.
389,00:23:22,00:23:30,"No, well, look, here's the situation is the family, they live in Mesquite, and I'm there on the weekends."
390,00:23:30,00:23:31,And during the week?
391,00:23:31,00:23:35,"I-I'm in sales, so I travel all over the country."
392,00:23:35,00:23:37,Which is why he rents a car when he's in town.
393,00:23:37,00:23:38,It's cheaper than leasing.
394,00:23:38,00:23:40,Cheaper.
395,00:23:40,00:23:43,"All right, but it still doesn't explain the empty apartment."
396,00:23:43,00:23:46,"Look, I... like being married."
397,00:23:47,00:23:56,"I... love my wife, my kid, but... I need my space."
398,00:23:56,00:24:03,"I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, so I just tell them that I'm out of town even when I'm not."
399,00:24:03,00:24:07,We're going to need your home address.
400,00:24:07,00:24:08,"No, look..."
401,00:24:08,00:24:10,I'm begging you.
402,00:24:10,00:24:13,Please don't blow things for me with the wife.
403,00:24:17,00:24:19,"Mom, what's going on?"
404,00:24:20,00:24:22,I don't understand.
405,00:24:22,00:24:25,"Mrs. Dunbar, could you and your son wait outside, please?"
406,00:24:25,00:24:26,"Ma'am, come with me."
407,00:24:26,00:24:28,I'll fill you in.
408,00:24:55,00:24:58,"Catherine, there is a volcano on the table."
409,00:25:05,00:25:08,Aluminum powder.
410,00:25:08,00:25:11,Polyvinylbutadiene.
411,00:25:15,00:25:17,Ammonium perchlorate.
412,00:25:17,00:25:21,The three ingredients to make lava flow.
413,00:25:21,00:25:25,"In fifth grade, I built one of these as my science fair project."
414,00:25:25,00:25:26,It was awesome.
415,00:25:26,00:25:28,First place should've been mine.
416,00:25:28,00:25:34,But they ended up giving it to this kid with some lame red ant colony.
417,00:25:35,00:25:37,That was you.
418,00:25:37,00:25:38,"Yeah, only my ants were Black Argentinians."
419,00:25:39,00:25:40,Uh-huh.
420,00:25:40,00:25:43,I learned at a very early age that the bugs always win.
421,00:25:43,00:25:45,Right.
422,00:25:47,00:25:50,"Trust me, Roger didn't build a bomb."
423,00:25:50,00:25:52,"I love my husband, but he's inept."
424,00:25:52,00:25:55,"Just last week, the hose bib cracked."
425,00:25:55,00:25:56,Front yard was a river.
426,00:25:57,00:25:59,Roger was helpless till I got home.
427,00:25:59,00:26:00,"Well, what about that volcano?"
428,00:26:00,00:26:04,Your husband said that he helped your son build it.
429,00:26:04,00:26:05,He watched.
430,00:26:05,00:26:07,I'm a teacher.
431,00:26:07,00:26:09,Timmy knows which parent to go to for help.
432,00:26:09,00:26:13,"Mrs. Dunbar, your husband told us that he was in sales."
433,00:26:15,00:26:16,He's with the State Department.
434,00:26:16,00:26:21,"You know, all that sensitive government stuff."
435,00:26:21,00:26:23,Keeps him on the road.
436,00:26:23,00:26:24,He doesn't say much about it.
437,00:26:24,00:26:29,"As far as you know, has he talked about his job with anyone else?"
438,00:26:29,00:26:31,Any other family members? Friends?
439,00:26:31,00:26:32,His parents are dead.
440,00:26:32,00:26:33,Roger's an only child.
441,00:26:33,00:26:37,He doesn't have time for friends.
442,00:26:37,00:26:40,"There was this one night, years ago."
443,00:26:40,00:26:43,We were both a little drunk and...
444,00:26:43,00:26:47,Roger confessed he was CIA.
445,00:26:54,00:26:57,"Hey, I made one of those in third grade."
446,00:26:57,00:27:00,Science fair.
447,00:27:00,00:27:01,"Should have won, too."
448,00:27:01,00:27:02,"Got to let it go, Nick."
449,00:27:03,00:27:06,Bomb end-cap with tool marks.
450,00:27:06,00:27:11,"Given the orientation and spread of the marks, consistent with pliers, vise-grips."
451,00:27:11,00:27:14,There were no vise-grips in the Dunbars' toolbox.
452,00:27:14,00:27:19,But given that the bomb and the volcano were similarly constructed...
453,00:27:19,00:27:22,We can compare the tool marks on both end-caps.
454,00:27:22,00:27:25,Doesn't matter what you make; it's what you make it with.
455,00:27:35,00:27:36,Not even close.
456,00:27:36,00:27:37,Mm-mm.
457,00:27:37,00:27:43,"So, whatever tool made the volcano did not make the bomb."
458,00:27:43,00:27:48,"Okay, I reconstructed the contents of the paper shredder."
459,00:27:48,00:27:49,Five bills.
460,00:27:49,00:27:50,All in Roger Dunbar's name.
461,00:27:50,00:27:53,Addressed to 2175 La Pressa.
462,00:27:53,00:27:56,Mm-hmm. His apartment.
463,00:27:56,00:27:58,"Okay, top two are credit card bills."
464,00:27:58,00:27:59,Both VISA.
465,00:27:59,00:28:01,Separate accounts.
466,00:28:01,00:28:03,WILLOWS: Roger A. Dunbar.
467,00:28:03,00:28:05,Roger B. Dunbar.
468,00:28:05,00:28:07,That's an easy way to separate out expenses.
469,00:28:07,00:28:09,Check out the gas bills.
470,00:28:09,00:28:10,Three different meters.
471,00:28:11,00:28:14,2175 La Pressa.
472,00:28:14,00:28:17,"822 Devon, Mesquite."
473,00:28:17,00:28:20,"1845 Galewood, Henderson."
474,00:28:20,00:28:25,"Hey, got the DNA results back from that bloody Band-Aid that Grissom found at Dunbar's apartment."
475,00:28:25,00:28:27,Compared it to his DNA. Not a match.
476,00:28:27,00:28:29,But I did find seven alleles in common.
477,00:28:29,00:28:31,His son.
478,00:28:31,00:28:32,No. It's female.
479,00:28:32,00:28:34,"Mother, sister, daughter."
480,00:28:34,00:28:38,"Well, according to his wife, his mother's deceased."
481,00:28:39,00:28:41,He's an only child.
482,00:28:41,00:28:43,"So, that leaves a daughter."
483,00:28:43,00:28:46,"Well, there's no way there was a kid at that apartment."
484,00:28:46,00:28:48,"Well, maybe she was living in Henderson."
485,00:28:48,00:28:54,"Forget ""secret agent."" Roger Dunbar was living a secret life."
486,00:29:03,00:29:04,Can I help you?
487,00:29:07,00:29:09,Good evening.
488,00:29:09,00:29:11,We're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
489,00:29:11,00:29:13,"Oh, God."
490,00:29:13,00:29:16,Did something happen to my husband?
491,00:29:16,00:29:17,He was supposed to be home on Monday night.
492,00:29:17,00:29:19,I've been calling his cell. He's not at work.
493,00:29:20,00:29:22,Is this your husband?
494,00:29:22,00:29:23,Yes.
495,00:29:23,00:29:24,You're currently married to him?
496,00:29:25,00:29:26,Yes. What is going on?
497,00:29:28,00:29:31,"WILLOWS: Well, your husband is a suspect in a criminal investigation."
498,00:29:31,00:29:33,"Currently, he's in police custody."
499,00:29:35,00:29:37,GRISSOM: Mrs. Dunbar?
500,00:29:38,00:29:41,Do you have a daughter?
501,00:29:41,00:29:42,Amy.
502,00:29:42,00:29:46,Is she entered in the science fair?
503,00:29:47,00:29:49,You can't take it.
504,00:29:50,00:29:54,"Amy, did you use this the tool to work on the inside of your volcano?"
505,00:29:54,00:29:55,"Yeah, my dad did."
506,00:29:55,00:29:57,He helped you build it?
507,00:29:57,00:29:59,Yeah.
508,00:29:59,00:30:00,I teach yoga.
509,00:30:00,00:30:02,I have no idea how this works.
510,00:30:02,00:30:04,It was all Roger.
511,00:30:04,00:30:06,When's your science fair?
512,00:30:06,00:30:07,Friday.
513,00:30:08,00:30:12,"Well, we'll do our best to get this back to you by Friday, okay?"
514,00:30:12,00:30:13,Okay.
515,00:30:15,00:30:17,BROWN: Which side do you want?
516,00:30:17,00:30:19,SIDLE: I'll take the west wing.
517,00:30:19,00:30:22,It's a nice place.
518,00:30:22,00:30:23,Uh-huh.
519,00:30:30,00:30:35,You could record a whole album in this studio.
520,00:30:35,00:30:37,This guy's got it made.
521,00:30:38,00:30:41,The life of a celebrity.
522,00:30:46,00:30:50,(plays jazz riff)
523,00:30:55,00:30:58,"I don't know, I think it sounds kind of isolating, living in a fishbowl."
524,00:30:58,00:30:59,Wouldn't be isolated.
525,00:30:59,00:31:03,"You'd have a butler, a maid service, laundry service."
526,00:31:04,00:31:06,Sheet music.
527,00:31:06,00:31:08,Guy writes his own stuff.
528,00:31:13,00:31:15,Dishwashing gloves.
529,00:31:15,00:31:18,Dry erase markers.
530,00:31:18,00:31:21,Slate Industrial Glass Cleaner.
531,00:31:21,00:31:25,The ingredients-- distilled water and hydrofluoric acid.
532,00:31:27,00:31:29,Fatal if swallowed.
533,00:31:32,00:31:36,You're sure you want to waive your right to an attorney?
534,00:31:36,00:31:39,I got nothin' to hide.
535,00:31:39,00:31:41,Do you recognize this product?
536,00:31:43,00:31:45,Yeah.
537,00:31:45,00:31:46,I use it to clean my windows.
538,00:31:46,00:31:49,Don't you have a maid or someone to do that for you?
539,00:31:49,00:31:51,I write songs late at night.
540,00:31:51,00:31:53,Windows are my chalkboard.
541,00:32:00,00:32:01,Mr. Rueben...
542,00:32:02,00:32:03,your wife was poisoned.
543,00:32:04,00:32:06,We suspect window cleaner was slipped into her wine.
544,00:32:07,00:32:07,It can't be.
545,00:32:08,00:32:08,I was there.
546,00:32:09,00:32:10,I opened that wine.
547,00:32:10,00:32:12,Did you have a fight?
548,00:32:12,00:32:13,Not lately.
549,00:32:13,00:32:15,But you have had fights in the past.
550,00:32:16,00:32:17,Who doesn't?
551,00:32:17,00:32:23,"I mean, fighting, loving, laughing... it all comes from the same place, man."
552,00:32:23,00:32:24,It's passion.
553,00:32:24,00:32:27,And we loved each other passionately.
554,00:32:31,00:32:34,"When we met, it was fate."
555,00:32:34,00:32:36,But you know what I need right now?
556,00:32:36,00:32:37,I need a woman.
557,00:32:37,00:32:41,I need a woman to come up here and be my inspiration.
558,00:32:42,00:32:43,"You, baby."
559,00:32:43,00:32:45,Second row. Come on up here.
560,00:33:02,00:33:04,I was looking for love.
561,00:33:04,00:33:07,She was looking for the same thing.
562,00:33:07,00:33:09,She loved my music.
563,00:33:11,00:33:13,I loved her smile.
564,00:33:13,00:33:17,"It's hard being on top, you know?"
565,00:33:18,00:33:20,"I mean, everybody loves you."
566,00:33:20,00:33:22,Wants their piece.
567,00:33:24,00:33:26,That's why we fought.
568,00:33:26,00:33:28,The time.
569,00:33:31,00:33:34,She knew she could never have me to herself.
570,00:33:36,00:33:39,"Look, I got sound check for the late show in an hour."
571,00:33:39,00:33:40,Can I go?
572,00:33:40,00:33:41,Sure.
573,00:33:44,00:33:47,We might want to talk to you later.
574,00:33:51,00:33:54,Wife's been dead less than 48 hours.
575,00:33:54,00:33:57,"Well, there's a man who definitely has his priorities straight."
576,00:33:57,00:34:01,"Okay, three people have admitted to being with Amelia the night that she died."
577,00:34:01,00:34:04,"The room service waiter, Myles, and Myles's manager."
578,00:34:04,00:34:05,Room service guy's out.
579,00:34:05,00:34:07,He left before the cork was popped.
580,00:34:07,00:34:15,"So, did Myles kill Amelia and the manager's covering for him or did the manager kill Amelia and Myles doesn't have a clue?"
581,00:34:15,00:34:18,BRASS: Bigamy is a Class D Felony.
582,00:34:18,00:34:23,"If convicted, you could be sentenced from one to four years in prison, do you know that?"
583,00:34:23,00:34:25,"I'd just married Beth, when I met Debbie."
584,00:34:26,00:34:27,She was a student.
585,00:34:27,00:34:29,UNLV.
586,00:34:30,00:34:31,She got pregnant.
587,00:34:31,00:34:33,I did the right thing.
588,00:34:33,00:34:41,"Ever since, it's been Monday through Friday with Debbie and weekends with Beth."
589,00:34:41,00:34:43,They both think I travel for a living.
590,00:34:43,00:34:47,"I know I keep coming back to this, but, uh... I mean, I got to ask you."
591,00:34:47,00:34:49,What's with the empty apartment?
592,00:34:49,00:34:52,Do you have a girlfriend on the side as well?
593,00:34:52,00:34:53,No.
594,00:34:56,00:34:57,Just tell them the truth.
595,00:35:01,00:35:05,My life is really a balancing act.
596,00:35:05,00:35:09,"Early on, I took Debbie to dinner and Beth saw it on a credit card statement."
597,00:35:09,00:35:17,"So instead of a P.O. Box, I figured why not rent a cheap apartment, you know?"
598,00:35:17,00:35:20,Have a night to myself once in a while.
599,00:35:20,00:35:25,We found a Band-Aid with your daughter Amy's blood at your apartment.
600,00:35:25,00:35:29,"So, you bring your daughter there, but not your wives?"
601,00:35:29,00:35:31,"Oh, no. It's not like that."
602,00:35:32,00:35:34,You know how kids are.
603,00:35:34,00:35:35,"Dad, take this."
604,00:35:35,00:35:37,It keeps falling off.
605,00:35:40,00:35:43,I emptied my pockets at the apartment.
606,00:35:43,00:35:49,"Mr. Dunbar, we collected both of your children's volcanoes and supplies."
607,00:35:49,00:35:54,And we found a pair of pliers at your home in Henderson.
608,00:35:54,00:35:57,Those pliers were used to make both of the volcanoes.
609,00:35:57,00:35:58,That's right.
610,00:35:58,00:36:03,"I needed pliers in Henderson, so I borrowed Beth's pliers from Mesquite."
611,00:36:03,00:36:04,There's no crime in that.
612,00:36:04,00:36:07,I'm just really confused.
613,00:36:07,00:36:14,"Um... your wife, Beth, told us that you couldn't build a volcano to save your soul."
614,00:36:14,00:36:19,"Yet your wife, Debbie, claims that it was all you that made your daughter's volcano."
615,00:36:19,00:36:20,"So, what is it?"
616,00:36:20,00:36:24,"Well, I watched Beth when she made Timmy's volcano."
617,00:36:24,00:36:28,"So, then when Amy had a science project, I knew the drill."
618,00:36:28,00:36:36,"Now, granted, it wasn't as symmetrical as Beth's and the lava flow was a little anemic, but... Amy liked it."
619,00:36:36,00:36:38,When did you borrow those pliers?
620,00:36:38,00:36:39,I don't know.
621,00:36:39,00:36:41,Couple weeks ago.
622,00:36:41,00:36:42,Why?
623,00:36:42,00:36:45,"You never returned them to your wife, Beth?"
624,00:36:47,00:36:50,I've been meaning to do that.
625,00:36:55,00:36:58,Same characteristics. We got a match.
626,00:37:00,00:37:01,Take her in.
627,00:37:28,00:37:30,I got prints.
628,00:37:30,00:37:32,I've got burns.
629,00:37:32,00:37:34,You first.
630,00:37:34,00:37:35,Sam or Myles?
631,00:37:35,00:37:37,Amelia's.
632,00:37:44,00:37:45,"Well, you're just in time."
633,00:37:45,00:37:46,She gets shipped in an hour.
634,00:37:46,00:37:48,This should just take a second.
635,00:37:48,00:37:50,"Could you give me her right hand, please?"
636,00:37:57,00:37:58,SARA: Three acid burns.
637,00:37:58,00:38:01,This is not a murder.
638,00:38:01,00:38:02,It's a suicide.
639,00:38:32,00:38:35,I knew she wasn't happy.
640,00:38:35,00:38:37,I guess I just didn't pay attention.
641,00:38:37,00:38:39,You shouldn't blame yourself for this.
642,00:38:39,00:38:41,Shouldn't I? Why shouldn't I?
643,00:38:41,00:38:45,I spend most of my time making them happy.
644,00:38:45,00:38:46,I never...
645,00:38:46,00:38:48,I never took the time to make her happy.
646,00:38:48,00:38:51,"(chanting): Amelia, Amelia!"
647,00:38:53,00:38:54,"What do you want to do, kid?"
648,00:39:00,00:39:02,"The show must go on, right?"
649,00:39:02,00:39:04,It's your call.
650,00:39:04,00:39:09,(chanting continues)
651,00:39:14,00:39:19,(cheering)
652,00:39:47,00:39:50,CATHERINE: We found these pliers in your car's glove box.
653,00:39:51,00:39:54,You used them to fix the faucet.
654,00:39:54,00:39:56,And to...
655,00:39:56,00:39:58,make a bomb.
656,00:40:00,00:40:01,Mrs. Dunbar...
657,00:40:01,00:40:05,how long have you known about Roger's double life?
658,00:40:06,00:40:10,His other wife's name is Debbie.
659,00:40:10,00:40:13,Once or twice a year he'd call me by that name.
660,00:40:13,00:40:14,I ignored it.
661,00:40:14,00:40:18,"It's very difficult for two people to live a lie, let alone three."
662,00:40:18,00:40:21,"Look, when Roger and I were together, he was a good husband."
663,00:40:21,00:40:22,Terrific father.
664,00:40:22,00:40:29,It was almost like being in a state of suspended honeymoon.
665,00:40:29,00:40:31,Really?
666,00:40:31,00:40:33,So what changed?
667,00:40:33,00:40:36,He asked me to get his dirty laundry out of the trunk of his car.
668,00:40:38,00:40:43,There was a plastic bag with all the makings of a volcano.
669,00:40:43,00:40:47,Including the stars I had hand-cut for my son.
670,00:40:50,00:40:56,"I'd always suspected there was another woman, but never..."
671,00:40:56,00:40:59,another family.
672,00:41:01,00:41:05,"Two weeks ago Sunday, I followed him."
673,00:41:05,00:41:09,"He, uh, dropped off his rental car and walked to some apartment building."
674,00:41:09,00:41:17,"Then he changed his clothes, and got into a nicer car, and drove out to Henderson."
675,00:41:17,00:41:20,Why didn't you just leave him? Turn him in?
676,00:41:22,00:41:24,He made a fool out of me.
677,00:41:25,00:41:27,A mockery of our life.
678,00:41:27,00:41:30,"Mrs. Dunbar, you killed three innocent people."
679,00:41:30,00:41:34,That was never my intention.
680,00:41:34,00:41:37,That bomb was supposed to go off at 8:30.
681,00:41:37,00:41:39,On his way to the airport.
682,00:41:41,00:41:43,Why a bomb?
683,00:41:43,00:41:47,"It, it's not much harder to make a bomb than a volcano."
