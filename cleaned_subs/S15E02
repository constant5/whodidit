0,00:00:01,00:00:04,MAN: I bake them all myself.
1,00:00:04,00:00:05,They're pretty damn tasty.
2,00:00:06,00:00:07,"Pretty potent, too."
3,00:00:07,00:00:09,"Of course, edibles are not for everybody."
4,00:00:09,00:00:14,I would say about 80% of our patients still prefer their cannabis in traditional form.
5,00:00:14,00:00:18,"If anxiety is your main ailment, I'd say you go with Purple Diesel."
6,00:00:18,00:00:21,It's got the perfect balance of alertness and relaxation.
7,00:00:21,00:00:23,"Leaves you functional, you know?"
8,00:00:24,00:00:25,There you go.
9,00:00:25,00:00:27,(inhales deeply)
10,00:00:27,00:00:30,"It smokes a little sweet and sour, with just..."
11,00:00:30,00:00:32,a hint of pine on the exhale.
12,00:00:32,00:00:34,"Yeah, that's nice."
13,00:00:34,00:00:37,"I'll go with that. Great. Your best deal, full ounce."
14,00:00:37,00:00:39,It's $320.
15,00:00:39,00:00:41,Don't suppose you take a card?
16,00:00:41,00:00:42,Cash only.
17,00:00:42,00:00:43,(doorbell rings)
18,00:00:43,00:00:45,"(door buzzes) Pretty, right?"
19,00:00:45,00:00:47,Yeah.
20,00:00:47,00:00:49,MAN: Get in there.
21,00:00:49,00:00:50,There you go.
22,00:00:50,00:00:51,Enjoy.
23,00:00:51,00:00:53,Thanks. Absolutely.
24,00:00:54,00:00:57,No need to be shy.
25,00:00:57,00:01:03,"We're all legal now. I just need to see your medical card, and I will set you up with the right strain for whatever ails you."
26,00:01:05,00:01:07,(phone chiming)
27,00:01:09,00:01:10,You should get that.
28,00:01:10,00:01:13,"No, it's... it's all right."
29,00:01:13,00:01:14,It'll wait.
30,00:01:14,00:01:17,(chiming continues)
31,00:01:17,00:01:18,No.
32,00:01:18,00:01:20,You need to get it now.
33,00:01:23,00:01:25,Uh...
34,00:01:25,00:01:26,(chuckles)
35,00:01:32,00:01:33,What the hell is this?
36,00:01:35,00:01:38,"Please, Lloyd, please just do what they say. Please."
37,00:01:38,00:01:41,"Please, Lloyd, please just do what they say. Please."
38,00:01:43,00:01:44,"Don't, Lloyd."
39,00:01:44,00:01:46,Think of your family.
40,00:01:48,00:01:50,Why are you doing this?
41,00:01:50,00:01:51,What do you want? Check your texts.
42,00:01:51,00:01:53,There should be instructions.
43,00:02:11,00:02:12,What about my family?
44,00:02:12,00:02:13,When am I gonna see them?
45,00:02:13,00:02:15,I don't know.
46,00:02:15,00:02:16,"Soon, I hope."
47,00:02:20,00:02:22,"Hey, what's going on?"
48,00:02:22,00:02:24,"Everything all right there, Lloyd?"
49,00:02:24,00:02:26,Hey.
50,00:02:26,00:02:28,"Hey, hold it right there!"
51,00:02:28,00:02:29,Stop!
52,00:02:29,00:02:30,"No! Wait, no!"
53,00:02:47,00:02:49,"Please, Lloyd. Please just do what they say. Please."
54,00:02:50,00:02:51,"Please, Lloyd. Please just do what they say..."
55,00:02:51,00:02:53,"SIDLE: The wonders of technology, right?"
56,00:02:53,00:02:56,The threats and the demands both sent to the guy's cell phone.
57,00:02:56,00:02:58,So the kidnapping's legit?
58,00:02:58,00:03:00,We checked on that?
59,00:03:00,00:03:01,"Yeah, cops confirmed."
60,00:03:01,00:03:03,Guy's wife never showed up to work.
61,00:03:03,00:03:05,Kids never made it to school.
62,00:03:05,00:03:08,Whoever sent the video and the text used the wife's phone.
63,00:03:08,00:03:10,We really got nothing to trace here.
64,00:03:10,00:03:12,Yeah. So right now...
65,00:03:12,00:03:14,she's our only lead.
66,00:03:14,00:03:15,"What do we know about her, David?"
67,00:03:15,00:03:17,"At the moment, next to nothing."
68,00:03:17,00:03:20,"She has no I.D., no car keys, no cell phone."
69,00:03:20,00:03:22,There's not a single thing to identify the body.
70,00:03:22,00:03:24,Did you run her prints? Yeah.
71,00:03:24,00:03:26,She doesn't have any.
72,00:03:26,00:03:27,What do you mean?
73,00:03:27,00:03:29,She has no fingerprints.
74,00:03:29,00:03:31,Her tips are completely smooth.
75,00:03:31,00:03:33,Let me see. Yeah.
76,00:03:33,00:03:39,"SIDLE: Nick, this woman is our only connection to finding that mother and her kids, to getting them back."
77,00:03:41,00:03:44,"STOKES: Well, that security guard only fired one shot."
78,00:03:44,00:03:47,Let's hope he didn't kill four people.
79,00:04:22,00:04:24,"Please, Lloyd, please just do what they say. Please."
80,00:04:24,00:04:28,"Please, Lloyd, please just do what they say. Please."
81,00:04:28,00:04:29,Why would she do this?
82,00:04:29,00:04:32,Why would she take my family from me?
83,00:04:32,00:04:33,My children?
84,00:04:33,00:04:37,"You told Detective Crawford that you'd never seen her before, that she'd never been in here."
85,00:04:37,00:04:38,What about your house?
86,00:04:38,00:04:44,"She and... whoever she might be working with were probably watching you, studying your habits."
87,00:04:44,00:04:46,Did you see any strange cars on the street this morning?
88,00:04:46,00:04:48,No. Everything was normal.
89,00:04:48,00:04:51,Dina drops the kids off at school on her way to work.
90,00:04:51,00:04:54,I... helped buckle them in the car.
91,00:04:54,00:04:55,Kissed them good-bye.
92,00:04:55,00:04:56,What if that's the last time I ever see them?
93,00:04:56,00:04:59,What if they're gone?
94,00:04:59,00:05:04,"Mr. Bryant, I know this is very difficult, but it doesn't do any good to think like that right now."
95,00:05:04,00:05:06,Right now...
96,00:05:06,00:05:09,"let's just focus on getting your family back, okay?"
97,00:05:09,00:05:10,Yeah.
98,00:05:15,00:05:17,What do you think?
99,00:05:17,00:05:21,"I don't know, man, she's still a mystery, all the way down to her perfectly smooth fingertips."
100,00:05:21,00:05:23,I've never seen anything like it.
101,00:05:23,00:05:24,You got something there with the shoes?
102,00:05:24,00:05:27,There is a foreign sticky substance on the soles.
103,00:05:27,00:05:32,"I didn't see the source for it anywhere in the shop, so she could've picked it up on the way in."
104,00:05:32,00:05:35,"Could tell us how she got here, where she came from."
105,00:05:35,00:05:36,You know what's bugging me?
106,00:05:36,00:05:37,Hmm? The money.
107,00:05:37,00:05:39,"Almost $300,000?"
108,00:05:39,00:05:42,"I mean, why did he have that much cash on him?"
109,00:05:42,00:05:43,"Yeah, yeah."
110,00:05:43,00:05:45,"Hey, Crawford? CRAWFORD: Yeah?"
111,00:05:45,00:05:47,What's the deal with all this cash?
112,00:05:47,00:05:48,These people never heard of banks?
113,00:05:48,00:05:52,"Yeah, banks, credit card companies-- they didn't want anything to do with the marijuana business."
114,00:05:52,00:05:55,They're afraid the funds could be seized as drug money.
115,00:05:55,00:05:56,But this is a legal dispensary.
116,00:05:56,00:05:58,"Legal, according to the state."
117,00:05:58,00:06:00,The Feds-- they have different ideas.
118,00:06:00,00:06:01,"So, these places are ""cash only""?"
119,00:06:01,00:06:02,Yeah.
120,00:06:02,00:06:04,"Well, it's no wonder this place was targeted."
121,00:06:04,00:06:07,"I mean, between the money and all this product, there's got to be a million dollars here."
122,00:06:07,00:06:12,"That explains the vault, the cameras, and that armed guard."
123,00:06:12,00:06:13,A lot of good that did.
124,00:06:13,00:06:16,Still couldn't protect what really matters.
125,00:06:27,00:06:31,"FINLAY: Jared Briscoe, the Gig Harbor Killer, murdered seven women."
126,00:06:31,00:06:34,RUSSELL: You think the brothers were working together?
127,00:06:34,00:06:36,FINLAY: I think they still are. RUSSELL: You want me to resign?
128,00:06:36,00:06:37,"ECKLIE: No, I don't want you to resign."
129,00:06:37,00:06:41,"If Briscoe and his brother really are the ones behind these murders, catch them."
130,00:06:50,00:06:54,"Greg told me I'd find you here, lost in Gig Harbor."
131,00:06:54,00:06:58,Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
132,00:06:58,00:07:00,I have no idea what I'm thinking.
133,00:07:00,00:07:02,I don't even know where to begin.
134,00:07:02,00:07:06,"It's like Seattle all over again, just waiting for another body to drop."
135,00:07:06,00:07:08,I have an idea where we should start.
136,00:07:09,00:07:14,Winthrop claimed that he didn't know he had a twin brother until he saw him on the news.
137,00:07:14,00:07:15,We both know that's not true.
138,00:07:15,00:07:18,"Yeah, but knowing something and proving it are two different things."
139,00:07:18,00:07:23,"Yeah, so we need to prove that their paths did cross before the killing started."
140,00:07:23,00:07:24,How we gonna do that?
141,00:07:24,00:07:27,"We go back to the beginning, and then we follow the road from there."
142,00:07:27,00:07:29,Start with the adoption.
143,00:07:29,00:07:30,Yes.
144,00:07:30,00:07:39,"So, I couldn't find any adoption history for Winthrop, but Briscoe was-- as his brother said-- ""consigned to the hell"" of foster care."
145,00:07:39,00:07:41,And we do have records for those.
146,00:07:41,00:07:42,"Yes, we do."
147,00:07:42,00:07:48,I'm not so sure that Ecklie's gonna give us the resources for this kind of fishing expedition.
148,00:07:48,00:07:49,Maybe he doesn't have to.
149,00:07:49,00:07:57,"I have some vacation days coming up, and I would love to take a trip to Seattle and dig through some adoption records and court files."
150,00:07:59,00:08:00,You know I like to fish.
151,00:08:05,00:08:08,Patrol unit spotted it in response to the BOLO.
152,00:08:08,00:08:11,"Belongs to Dina Bryant, dispensary owner's wife."
153,00:08:11,00:08:14,"Well, this street's on the route from their house to the kids' preschool."
154,00:08:14,00:08:17,Kidnappers must've followed them from home.
155,00:08:17,00:08:19,Cops said they spoke to a woman who heard tires squealing.
156,00:08:19,00:08:22,"She looked out, saw a van racing away."
157,00:08:22,00:08:24,A dark blue van?
158,00:08:24,00:08:26,Yeah. How did you know that?
159,00:08:26,00:08:29,Looks like a fresh dent on the bumper here.
160,00:08:29,00:08:30,Some blue paint left behind.
161,00:08:30,00:08:32,(camera clicks)
162,00:08:32,00:08:34,Must have been how they were taken.
163,00:08:34,00:08:36,Kidnapper bumped the back of the car.
164,00:08:36,00:08:38,"Okay, stay right here. I'll be right back, okay?"
165,00:08:38,00:08:43,(tires screech) BRODY: And then grabbed them when the mother pulls over to exchange insurance information.
166,00:08:43,00:08:44,"No, please! My babies!"
167,00:08:52,00:08:54,STOKES: Hey.
168,00:08:54,00:08:56,"I can't figure her out, Nick."
169,00:08:56,00:08:57,What do you mean?
170,00:08:57,00:08:59,There's just nothing about her that fits.
171,00:08:59,00:09:00,This crime was well-planned.
172,00:09:00,00:09:03,"Despite the fact that it went sideways, it was smart."
173,00:09:03,00:09:06,But watching her-- she has no idea what she's doing.
174,00:09:06,00:09:09,"She's nervous, she's tense, hesitant."
175,00:09:09,00:09:13,"She's way out of her element. Well, I'm still trying to figure out how she even got there."
176,00:09:13,00:09:19,"She didn't have any car keys, the cops checked the parking lot around the crime scene, didn't find a car that could've been hers, so she must have had a ride."
177,00:09:19,00:09:21,"What's that? Oh, yeah."
178,00:09:21,00:09:26,This is the latest footage from a check-cashing place up the street from the dispensary.
179,00:09:26,00:09:30,"It's kind of hard to see, but the dispensary should be right up there."
180,00:09:30,00:09:32,"Yeah, but look."
181,00:09:32,00:09:34,"That car, double parked."
182,00:09:34,00:09:35,"Looks like a Mustang, black."
183,00:09:35,00:09:38,Then it suddenly takes off.
184,00:09:38,00:09:40,Check that time code.
185,00:09:40,00:09:43,That's just seconds after the security guard fired his gun.
186,00:09:43,00:09:45,That's got to be it. That's the partner right there.
187,00:09:45,00:09:47,There's no way in hell to read the plates.
188,00:09:47,00:09:48,No.
189,00:09:48,00:09:49,It's molasses.
190,00:09:49,00:09:51,What is?
191,00:09:51,00:09:54,HODGES: The sticky substance on the bottom of her shoes-- it's molasses.
192,00:09:54,00:09:56,Blackstrap molasses to be specific.
193,00:09:56,00:09:58,Come on. Who uses molasses these days?
194,00:09:58,00:10:01,Interesting answer: marijuana growers.
195,00:10:01,00:10:05,"For what? Molasses, it turns out, is a common soil additive to cultivating cannabis."
196,00:10:05,00:10:07,This lady was a grower?
197,00:10:07,00:10:10,I don't buy that any more than I buy her as a kidnapper.
198,00:10:10,00:10:14,CRAWFORD: The woman-- who could she have been working with?
199,00:10:14,00:10:18,Did you have any problems with anyone opening up your shop?
200,00:10:18,00:10:20,Do you owe money?
201,00:10:20,00:10:22,Do you deal with anyone who could be trouble?
202,00:10:22,00:10:24,Are you kidding me?
203,00:10:24,00:10:26,I'm in the drug business.
204,00:10:26,00:10:30,"I may be legal, but it's a gray area at best."
205,00:10:30,00:10:32,My growers are technically outlaws.
206,00:10:32,00:10:38,My main competition are street dealers and-and delivery services who think I'm stealing their business.
207,00:10:38,00:10:40,It's the Wild West all over again.
208,00:10:40,00:10:41,"Yeah, I understand that."
209,00:10:41,00:10:44,But was there anyone in particular?
210,00:10:44,00:10:46,I don't know.
211,00:10:46,00:10:52,It could be anyone who has any idea how much cash involved.
212,00:10:58,00:11:00,What now?
213,00:11:00,00:11:02,What am I supposed to do?
214,00:11:02,00:11:05,We wait for the kidnappers to try to make contact with you again.
215,00:11:05,00:11:07,"Now, we already have people-- police-- at your house."
216,00:11:07,00:11:09,They're setting up your phones.
217,00:11:09,00:11:11,We're gonna do the same thing here.
218,00:11:11,00:11:12,That's it?
219,00:11:19,00:11:22,David said you were done.
220,00:11:22,00:11:23,You find anything?
221,00:11:23,00:11:24,Not what you're looking for.
222,00:11:24,00:11:29,"There are no surgical or cosmetic implants, nothing with a serial number we could trace."
223,00:11:29,00:11:32,Her identity is still a mystery. Afraid so.
224,00:11:32,00:11:35,"I can explain the absence of fingerprints, if it's any consolation."
225,00:11:35,00:11:37,She was on a drug called capecitabine.
226,00:11:37,00:11:40,One of its side effects is the shedding of fingerprints.
227,00:11:40,00:11:42,And what is the drug used for?
228,00:11:42,00:11:44,It's given to recovering cancer patients.
229,00:11:44,00:11:47,She'd undergone surgery for colon cancer.
230,00:11:47,00:11:49,"Successful surgery, it appears."
231,00:11:49,00:11:52,"I thought it was interesting, given how she got here."
232,00:11:52,00:11:53,Her tox report.
233,00:11:55,00:11:58,She tested positive for THC.
234,00:11:58,00:11:59,She was a marijuana user.
235,00:11:59,00:12:02,"Medicinal, probably, because of the cancer."
236,00:12:02,00:12:08,There was no evidence of heavier substances or intravenous drug use.
237,00:12:08,00:12:11,"You know, maybe we're not beaten yet."
238,00:12:11,00:12:13,Her axillary lymph nodes are discolored.
239,00:12:13,00:12:17,"I assumed it was due to melanoma, given her history."
240,00:12:17,00:12:19,But it could be something else.
241,00:12:19,00:12:20,"Something else, like what?"
242,00:12:20,00:12:21,"Well, let's find out."
243,00:12:24,00:12:28,"Well, the node is easily enough removed."
244,00:12:28,00:12:29,(grunts softly)
245,00:12:39,00:12:40,BRODY: That looks like ink.
246,00:12:40,00:12:42,It is. Tattoo ink.
247,00:12:42,00:12:45,"During the tattoo process, it's deposited in the dermis."
248,00:12:45,00:12:51,"Microphages digest it, and then migrate into the closest lymph nodes."
249,00:12:51,00:12:53,But she doesn't have any tattoos.
250,00:12:53,00:12:56,"She doesn't now, but she did at some point."
251,00:12:56,00:12:58,Why don't you hit the lights.
252,00:12:58,00:13:00,"Even if it's been removed, we can still find it."
253,00:13:06,00:13:08,Why don't you turn her head there.
254,00:13:08,00:13:10,There you go.
255,00:13:10,00:13:13,"It was laser removed, but there's no hiding from the ALS."
256,00:13:16,00:13:18,You know what? I've seen this tattoo before.
257,00:13:20,00:13:22,RUSSELL: Morgan said we had a lead on the dispensary case?
258,00:13:22,00:13:26,"Maybe. Turns out, our mystery woman had a tattoo on her neck."
259,00:13:26,00:13:30,"Ties her to a local gang set, the Bridge Rock Devils."
260,00:13:30,00:13:31,And those are all devils?
261,00:13:31,00:13:35,I pulled arrest records on every female member arrested in the last ten years.
262,00:13:35,00:13:38,Wait a minute.
263,00:13:38,00:13:40,What about that? Could be.
264,00:13:41,00:13:42,That's her.
265,00:13:42,00:13:43,Seven years ago.
266,00:13:43,00:13:45,Allison Ball.
267,00:13:45,00:13:47,Current address?
268,00:13:47,00:13:50,"SANDERS: 1217 Crescent, Boulder City."
269,00:13:56,00:13:57,Clear!
270,00:13:58,00:13:59,Bedroom's clear!
271,00:13:59,00:14:01,"Sorry, Stokes."
272,00:14:01,00:14:03,No sign of any hostages.
273,00:14:03,00:14:04,Place is all yours.
274,00:14:04,00:14:07,"Okay, thank you, Captain."
275,00:14:18,00:14:20,"""Teacher of the Year""?"
276,00:14:20,00:14:22,"Yeah, something's not right."
277,00:14:22,00:14:26,Does this look like the home of a lady who would kidnap somebody to you?
278,00:14:26,00:14:28,No.
279,00:14:29,00:14:31,"Hey, Nick, her phone."
280,00:14:33,00:14:34,"She got a video, too."
281,00:14:36,00:14:38,"I'm sorry, Ally."
282,00:14:38,00:14:42,"Please, just do what they say, or they're gonna kill me."
283,00:14:42,00:14:44,"I'm sorry, Ally."
284,00:14:44,00:14:45,Who is he?
285,00:14:45,00:14:49,"I don't know, but there's pictures of him up all over the place. Brother, maybe?"
286,00:14:49,00:14:52,"Yeah, either that or a boyfriend."
287,00:14:52,00:14:54,She didn't go to that dispensary to rob the place.
288,00:14:54,00:14:56,She was trying to save him.
289,00:14:56,00:14:58,She's not the one we're after here.
290,00:14:58,00:15:01,And it looks like we have one more hostage to find.
291,00:15:05,00:15:06,"I'm sorry, Ally."
292,00:15:06,00:15:11,"Please, just do what they say, or they're gonna kill me."
293,00:15:11,00:15:13,"I'm sorry, Ally. Please..."
294,00:15:13,00:15:17,STOKES: The young man tied up in that video is Allison Ball's little brother.
295,00:15:17,00:15:20,"Stuart-- 24 years old, no criminal record."
296,00:15:20,00:15:24,"Greg's at his apartment right now, checking him out."
297,00:15:24,00:15:26,Can we trace the phone that sent this?
298,00:15:26,00:15:28,"No, no. Same as before."
299,00:15:28,00:15:30,The bad guys used the victim's phone.
300,00:15:30,00:15:32,Same with the text with the instructions on it.
301,00:15:32,00:15:33,Gave the address of the dispensary.
302,00:15:33,00:15:40,Told her to go there to be with the owner at 10:15 a.m. exactly.
303,00:15:40,00:15:47,"""If either of you fail to follow instructions, your brother dies."" Our dead teacher's just a pawn in all of this."
304,00:15:47,00:15:53,Bad guys who are using her to insulate themselves from the crime.
305,00:15:53,00:15:56,"Well, yeah, that way they don't have to step one foot in that dispensary."
306,00:15:56,00:15:57,You know? They're never on camera.
307,00:15:57,00:15:58,It's ingenious.
308,00:15:58,00:16:03,Why these two? Why were the teacher and her brother chosen for this robbery?
309,00:16:03,00:16:09,Must have just crossed paths with the kidnapper at some point.
310,00:16:09,00:16:10,"Well, she's a teacher."
311,00:16:10,00:16:12,Maybe we're looking at a parent of one of her students.
312,00:16:12,00:16:17,She just went through a whole year of cancer treatments; it could be somebody associated with that.
313,00:16:17,00:16:21,Or...
314,00:16:21,00:16:24,could be the demon weed.
315,00:16:24,00:16:29,"You know, Lloyd said that he'd never seen Allison before, that she wasn't a customer."
316,00:16:29,00:16:31,You think he could've been lying? You think he knew her?
317,00:16:31,00:16:36,"If we can prove a connection here, then maybe we're having another conversation with Lloyd."
318,00:16:36,00:16:40,The common denominator in all of this?
319,00:16:40,00:16:41,Marijuana.
320,00:17:12,00:17:13,(sniffs)
321,00:17:13,00:17:16,"There was this guy, lived in my dorm in college."
322,00:17:16,00:17:17,Everybody used to call him Space Bob.
323,00:17:17,00:17:19,Your lab smells like his room.
324,00:17:19,00:17:21,That's not a compliment to either of you.
325,00:17:21,00:17:23,"Yeah, it is pretty pungent in here."
326,00:17:23,00:17:27,"Uh, especially the Skunkadelic."
327,00:17:27,00:17:29,"Mmm, mm-hmm."
328,00:17:29,00:17:30,This is all from Lloyd's dispensary?
329,00:17:30,00:17:32,All these strains?
330,00:17:32,00:17:36,"I don't mean to sound square, but is there really that big a difference, one from the other?"
331,00:17:36,00:17:44,"Absolutely. Each strain has its own unique level of, uh, countless cannabinoids and terpenoids, which gives pot its medicinal value."
332,00:17:44,00:17:48,"Believe it or not, there is a legit medical basis for marijuana use."
333,00:17:48,00:17:50,"Uh, granted, the names don't really help the credibility."
334,00:17:50,00:17:52,"Yeah, well, that's true. Yeah."
335,00:17:52,00:17:54,What else did you find out?
336,00:17:54,00:17:58,"Well, I'm using Near IR Spectrometry to analyze Lloyd's inventory."
337,00:17:58,00:18:05,"Because of the varying cannabinoid levels of each strain, it produces its own unique wave form or spectrum."
338,00:18:05,00:18:06,"Uh, fingerprint of sorts."
339,00:18:06,00:18:08,Ah.
340,00:18:08,00:18:11,"Well, which wave form is from our dead teacher's pot?"
341,00:18:11,00:18:13,It's this one here.
342,00:18:13,00:18:16,"Unfortunately, it's not a match to any of Lloyd's stuff."
343,00:18:16,00:18:19,Allison Ball wasn't buying her marijuana from Lloyd's dispensary?
344,00:18:19,00:18:22,"Well, that makes me wonder where she was getting it from."
345,00:18:22,00:18:24,"Well, there might be a way to find out."
346,00:18:24,00:18:27,"There's a database being assembled in Connecticut, with help from the Feds."
347,00:18:27,00:18:30,They're cataloging marijuana by its actual DNA.
348,00:18:30,00:18:32,CODIS for cannabis?
349,00:18:32,00:18:39,"You know, if Henry can isolate a DNA profile for Allison Ball's marijuana, then we might get lucky and run it against the Feds' database."
350,00:18:45,00:18:48,Hey. What's all this?
351,00:18:48,00:18:50,Allison Ball's life.
352,00:18:50,00:18:53,"Her finances, her health, her job."
353,00:18:53,00:18:56,All the little lives that she touched.
354,00:18:56,00:18:58,"Well, I, uh, just checked out her brother's apartment."
355,00:18:58,00:19:02,I'm thinking that he might be a little sketchy.
356,00:19:02,00:19:03,"Oh, what do you mean? What'd you find?"
357,00:19:03,00:19:05,"Well, it's more what I didn't find."
358,00:19:05,00:19:06,No evidence of employment.
359,00:19:06,00:19:09,"No check stubs, no bank or tax statement."
360,00:19:09,00:19:11,Yet he lives in this nice place.
361,00:19:11,00:19:14,"Has a big TV, gaming system and all that."
362,00:19:14,00:19:18,"I don't know, maybe big sister was, uh, helping him out financially."
363,00:19:18,00:19:20,I-I don't know how.
364,00:19:20,00:19:26,"I... I mean, from what I've seen, it looks like her cancer pretty much obliterated her finances."
365,00:19:26,00:19:28,She basically had nothing left.
366,00:19:30,00:19:32,Except...
367,00:19:32,00:19:34,Wow. This is weird.
368,00:19:34,00:19:35,Uh... What?
369,00:19:35,00:19:38,How do you think that happened?
370,00:19:42,00:19:43,"Hey, Russell, you got a sec?"
371,00:19:43,00:19:45,I do. What do you got?
372,00:19:45,00:19:51,"Uh, bank statement for Allison Ball shows a $50,000-deposit made to her account just six weeks ago."
373,00:19:51,00:19:53,"$50,000? From whom? No record."
374,00:19:53,00:19:55,It was all cash.
375,00:19:55,00:20:00,"So how does a teacher who makes, what, 65K tops come across $50,000 cash?"
376,00:20:00,00:20:02,Maybe she wasn't just an innocent victim.
377,00:20:02,00:20:04,All right...
378,00:20:04,00:20:05,"Uh, gentlemen?"
379,00:20:05,00:20:08,I've got something you might find interesting.
380,00:20:08,00:20:12,"""Us-2-U Wellness."" It's an online marijuana delivery service."
381,00:20:12,00:20:14,There are dozens that operate locally.
382,00:20:14,00:20:19,"You can scroll through their various strains-- indicas, sativas, hybrids."
383,00:20:19,00:20:21,"Point, click and the order's at your door in two hours."
384,00:20:21,00:20:24,And-and what does this have to do with our case?
385,00:20:24,00:20:27,The Feds recently raided Us-2-U.
386,00:20:27,00:20:35,"And the pot that they seized was entered into their burgeoning marijuana DNA database, where they found a match to the pot that you found in Allison's apartment."
387,00:20:35,00:20:38,So that's where she got her marijuana.
388,00:20:38,00:20:40,And the guy behind Us-2-U...
389,00:20:40,00:20:42,Calvin Reynolds.
390,00:20:42,00:20:44,Calvin Reynolds drives a black Mustang.
391,00:20:44,00:20:49,Nick and Sara said that they saw a black Mustang in front of the dispensary.
392,00:20:49,00:20:51,It took off after Allison was shot.
393,00:20:51,00:20:54,"CRAWFORD: You seem to be running afoul of the law lately, Calvin."
394,00:20:54,00:20:56,What's up with that?
395,00:20:56,00:20:57,You mean the Fed bust?
396,00:20:57,00:20:59,That's crap.
397,00:20:59,00:21:01,My attorneys already filed to have the case dropped.
398,00:21:01,00:21:03,The Web site was back up and running in three days.
399,00:21:03,00:21:06,Medical marijuana use is legal in Nevada.
400,00:21:06,00:21:07,"Pretty soon, recreational use will be, too."
401,00:21:07,00:21:09,"You got a problem with that, that's too bad."
402,00:21:09,00:21:11,"To be honest, I really don't care one way or another."
403,00:21:11,00:21:13,This isn't about marijuana for me.
404,00:21:13,00:21:16,"You, uh..."
405,00:21:16,00:21:18,You know this woman?
406,00:21:18,00:21:20,That's Allison Ball.
407,00:21:20,00:21:25,Strange thing-- she had molasses on the soles of her shoes when she was shot dead this morning.
408,00:21:27,00:21:31,"Well, molasses is used in the cultivation of cannabis, right?"
409,00:21:31,00:21:32,"Yeah, sure. Lot of the growers use it."
410,00:21:32,00:21:33,Do you?
411,00:21:33,00:21:42,"Hey, the only reason I'm asking is because we had a look inside of that black Mustang of yours and we found molasses spilled all on the carpet."
412,00:21:42,00:21:49,"Now, in my mind, that puts Allison in your car and you, Calvin, in front of the dispensary when she was shot."
413,00:21:51,00:21:54,"Hey, buddy..."
414,00:21:54,00:21:55,I get the motive.
415,00:21:55,00:21:57,"You know, you used to be the only game in town."
416,00:21:57,00:22:00,Now you have these dispensaries opening up.
417,00:22:00,00:22:02,"I mean, they're stealing your business."
418,00:22:02,00:22:04,They're stealing your money.
419,00:22:04,00:22:06,"Tell me, why her?"
420,00:22:06,00:22:11,"Why would you rope a poor, innocent girl into your scheme?"
421,00:22:11,00:22:13,Nobody ever roped Ally into anything.
422,00:22:14,00:22:16,"The fact is, she called me."
423,00:22:16,00:22:21,"Oh, so she was the criminal mastermind behind all of this. (chuckles)"
424,00:22:21,00:22:22,Is that it?
425,00:22:22,00:22:25,Ally and me go way back.
426,00:22:25,00:22:26,We both grew up in Bridge Rock.
427,00:22:26,00:22:28,We were both Devils.
428,00:22:28,00:22:29,She got out.
429,00:22:29,00:22:32,Made a better life.
430,00:22:32,00:22:34,But she always called me when she needed me.
431,00:22:34,00:22:38,"Like when the cancer came and the doctor suggested pot might help, she called me."
432,00:22:38,00:22:42,"When her medical bills started piling up and the treatment became too expensive, she called me."
433,00:22:42,00:22:44,So you gave her money?
434,00:22:44,00:22:47,"$50,000. And I'd do it again in a second, gladly, just..."
435,00:22:49,00:22:51,...just because of who she was.
436,00:22:51,00:22:53,So you helped her out from time to time.
437,00:22:53,00:22:57,How does that get us to today?
438,00:22:57,00:22:59,She called me this morning.
439,00:22:59,00:23:02,"She was panicked, said..."
440,00:23:02,00:23:04,said somebody had grabbed up her brother.
441,00:23:04,00:23:08,"And they had, uh, you know, given... given her instructions on how to get him back."
442,00:23:08,00:23:12,"But she was, uh... she was scared."
443,00:23:12,00:23:14,She was... she was too freaked out to do it alone.
444,00:23:14,00:23:18,So she called... and she asked you to drive.
445,00:23:18,00:23:20,And I would've done the whole thing for her if I could.
446,00:23:23,00:23:27,When I realized she...
447,00:23:27,00:23:30,"she wasn't coming back out, I..."
448,00:23:30,00:23:32,(sighs)
449,00:23:32,00:23:34,...I just left.
450,00:23:38,00:23:40,She should've just let that bastard rot.
451,00:23:40,00:23:44,You're talking about her brother-- Stuart?
452,00:23:44,00:23:46,Ally said he'd been running numbers for some bookie.
453,00:23:46,00:23:48,She thought that's who would be behind the kidnapping.
454,00:23:48,00:23:51,"Okay, Calvin, do you know who he was working for?"
455,00:23:51,00:23:54,I need a name. I need the name of the bookie.
456,00:23:54,00:23:55,No.
457,00:23:55,00:23:57,"No, Ally didn't know the name."
458,00:23:59,00:24:01,What's going on? Have you heard anything?
459,00:24:01,00:24:03,"No. Not yet, Lloyd. I'm sorry."
460,00:24:03,00:24:06,This doesn't make any sense! They should have called by now!
461,00:24:06,00:24:07,They should have made contact!
462,00:24:07,00:24:08,Why haven't they called?! Lloyd!
463,00:24:08,00:24:09,Listen to me.
464,00:24:09,00:24:14,"Whoever the kidnappers are, they are scrambling right now, trying to come up with a new plan."
465,00:24:14,00:24:15,We just have to wait.
466,00:24:15,00:24:17,For how long?
467,00:24:17,00:24:18,I don't know.
468,00:24:18,00:24:20,But I know they're worth waiting for.
469,00:24:20,00:24:23,In the meantime...
470,00:24:23,00:24:25,maybe you can help me.
471,00:24:25,00:24:26,Have you seen this guy?
472,00:24:26,00:24:30,His name is Stuart Ball; He's the brother of the woman that was shot in here this morning.
473,00:24:30,00:24:31,Do you know him?
474,00:24:31,00:24:33,"Has he been in here, maybe?"
475,00:24:33,00:24:35,No. I don't recognize him.
476,00:24:35,00:24:37,Is he involved somehow?
477,00:24:37,00:24:38,He's in business with some bad people.
478,00:24:38,00:24:40,That's all we know right now.
479,00:24:40,00:24:42,(phone ringing)
480,00:24:42,00:24:43,"Hold on, Lloyd, hold on. Not yet."
481,00:24:43,00:24:46,(phone continues ringing)
482,00:24:47,00:24:49,"All right, I'm ready."
483,00:24:50,00:24:51,"Go ahead, answer it."
484,00:24:53,00:24:55,Hello?
485,00:24:57,00:25:00,No. We're closed right now.
486,00:25:00,00:25:01,I don't know for how long.
487,00:25:01,00:25:04,I have to keep this line free.
488,00:25:04,00:25:05,(cell phone ringing)
489,00:25:05,00:25:08,This is Keys.
490,00:25:08,00:25:10,You got him. Where?
491,00:25:10,00:25:13,Yeah. You were just asking about Stuart Ball?
492,00:25:13,00:25:15,"Well, it sounds like our guys just found him."
493,00:25:15,00:25:18,(indistinct police radio chatter)
494,00:25:18,00:25:21,SANDERS: Blue van.
495,00:25:21,00:25:24,BRODY: Just like the woman saw speeding away from the kidnapping.
496,00:25:30,00:25:32,(flies buzzing)
497,00:25:35,00:25:37,It's just Stuart.
498,00:25:37,00:25:39,No sign of the mother or the kids.
499,00:25:39,00:25:43,"Well, now we know whoever has them isn't afraid to kill."
500,00:25:51,00:25:55,Just talked to the van's owner; pretty much sure I ruined his Hawaiian vacation.
501,00:25:55,00:25:58,He's in Hawaii? So the van's stolen?
502,00:25:58,00:25:59,Mm-hmm.
503,00:25:59,00:26:01,"Well, the shot was at close range."
504,00:26:01,00:26:06,The shooter was in the van with the victim-- most likely in the passenger seat.
505,00:26:06,00:26:08,Although...
506,00:26:08,00:26:11,that's a good amount of high-velocity impact spatter up here.
507,00:26:11,00:26:14,Maybe a little luminol will tell a better story.
508,00:26:25,00:26:28,There's blood splatter all over the passenger seat.
509,00:26:28,00:26:31,"Not all of it. Look there, on the side of the seat."
510,00:26:31,00:26:33,There's a blood void.
511,00:26:33,00:26:35,From what?
512,00:26:35,00:26:37,The shooter wasn't up front.
513,00:26:37,00:26:38,He was in back.
514,00:26:38,00:26:41,BRODY: He reached between the seats to fire.
515,00:26:41,00:26:45,His arm kept the blood from hitting that part of the seat.
516,00:26:45,00:26:47,It settled on his arm instead.
517,00:26:47,00:26:48,But what about the round?
518,00:26:48,00:26:50,The shot was through-and-through.
519,00:26:50,00:26:52,Didn't break any windows.
520,00:26:53,00:26:55,It caught the A-pillar.
521,00:27:02,00:27:05,"STOKES: According to Doc Robbins, Stuart Ball died between six and ten hours ago."
522,00:27:05,00:27:09,Six to ten-- that's shortly after the robbery went bad.
523,00:27:09,00:27:10,Yeah.
524,00:27:10,00:27:13,That can't help our chances of finding the mother and her kids alive.
525,00:27:13,00:27:15,"Stuart Ball had served his purpose, right?"
526,00:27:15,00:27:19,Mother and the two kids could still be worth some money.
527,00:27:19,00:27:20,That might be reason to keep them alive.
528,00:27:20,00:27:22,"Well, I hope you're right."
529,00:27:22,00:27:25,"Hey, guys, I think we just caught a break with ballistics."
530,00:27:25,00:27:28,I got an IBIS hit off the bullet that killed Stuart Ball.
531,00:27:28,00:27:32,It matches a round that was fired five years ago in a fatal carjacking attempt.
532,00:27:32,00:27:34,Did they catch the carjacker?
533,00:27:34,00:27:35,In a matter of speaking.
534,00:27:35,00:27:36,I guess the carjacker was the fatality.
535,00:27:36,00:27:39,The owner of the car shot him in self-defense.
536,00:27:39,00:27:42,So the gun belonged to the car owner-- tell me you got a name.
537,00:27:42,00:27:46,Remi Volero-- he's kind of a low-rent real estate mogul.
538,00:27:46,00:27:48,Mostly strip clubs and mini-malls.
539,00:27:48,00:27:52,But take a look at the rap sheet-- everything on it is related to bookmaking and racketeering.
540,00:27:52,00:27:53,Guy's a bookie.
541,00:27:53,00:27:56,"Well, Stuart Ball was running numbers for a bookie."
542,00:27:56,00:27:57,What are the odds?
543,00:27:57,00:27:58,It's got to be the same guy.
544,00:27:58,00:28:02,"That your handiwork, Remi?"
545,00:28:02,00:28:04,That is not my handiwork.
546,00:28:04,00:28:06,I don't know what the hell that is.
547,00:28:06,00:28:08,You don't know him? Stuart Ball?
548,00:28:08,00:28:10,'Cause I'm pretty sure he worked for you.
549,00:28:10,00:28:13,I said I didn't know whatthat is.
550,00:28:13,00:28:15,I didn't say I didn't know who.
551,00:28:15,00:28:18,"Yeah, Stuart worked for me running errands."
552,00:28:18,00:28:22,He worked for you running numbers and making collections as part of your illegal gambling operation.
553,00:28:23,00:28:26,You're not even gonna ask what happened to him?
554,00:28:26,00:28:27,I can see what happened to him.
555,00:28:27,00:28:29,Someone capped him.
556,00:28:29,00:28:30,"Yeah, somebody-- with your gun."
557,00:28:30,00:28:32,"Did you forget, Remi? Your gun's in the system."
558,00:28:32,00:28:34,You used it five years ago to shoot a carjacker.
559,00:28:34,00:28:38,"The thing is, it's not my gun anymore."
560,00:28:38,00:28:39,I gave it to Stuart a couple years back.
561,00:28:39,00:28:41,"Where are they, Remi!"
562,00:28:41,00:28:42,Where's Dina Bryant and her children?!
563,00:28:42,00:28:44,I don't know what you're talking about.
564,00:28:44,00:28:45,"Yeah, you do."
565,00:28:45,00:28:48,You are underwater on a dozen real estate investments.
566,00:28:48,00:28:50,That dispensary was an easy mark.
567,00:28:50,00:28:52,All that cash just sitting there.
568,00:28:53,00:28:58,This isn't a conversation I'm interested in having.
569,00:28:58,00:29:00,I want my lawyer.
570,00:29:01,00:29:04,"RUSSELL: It's awfully convenient he gave his gun to Stuart, don't you think?"
571,00:29:04,00:29:09,"Crawford's willing to hold him for 48 hours, but I don't know if that's gonna help Dina Bryant and her kids."
572,00:29:09,00:29:12,"You said that this Remi guy had a lot of real estate, right?"
573,00:29:12,00:29:13,At least 25 properties.
574,00:29:13,00:29:15,He could be using any of them or none of them.
575,00:29:15,00:29:17,We have the kidnap van.
576,00:29:17,00:29:21,"The odds are pretty good that wherever the victims are, that van was there."
577,00:29:21,00:29:23,"We keep working the van, figure out where it's been."
578,00:29:23,00:29:24,RUSSELL: Right.
579,00:30:11,00:30:16,"What do you mean he's gone? Well, yeah, but how does something like that happen? I'm on my way right now."
580,00:30:16,00:30:18,BRODY: Nick.
581,00:30:18,00:30:19,What's going on?
582,00:30:19,00:30:22,"Well, Lloyd has ducked out on the cops that were babysitting him; now nobody can find him."
583,00:30:22,00:30:27,The only reason he would have taken off is if the kidnappers contacted him.
584,00:30:27,00:30:29,He must have gone to pay the ransom.
585,00:30:29,00:30:31,Crawford's got a bead on his cell phone; we'll find him.
586,00:30:51,00:30:54,"What's up? LLOYD: No, no, no."
587,00:30:54,00:30:55,What are you doing here? You can't be here!
588,00:30:55,00:30:57,They said no cops! Who did?
589,00:30:57,00:30:58,"No, no! You have to go!"
590,00:30:58,00:31:01,"If you're here, they won't bring my family."
591,00:31:01,00:31:02,"Who's ""they""? Did somebody contact you?"
592,00:31:03,00:31:06,"Lloyd, where's the money?"
593,00:31:06,00:31:08,"I dropped it off to them, like they said."
594,00:31:08,00:31:10,I gave them what they wanted.
595,00:31:10,00:31:12,Where? And how?
596,00:31:12,00:31:14,"Over at the tennis courts, across the park."
597,00:31:14,00:31:15,Gonna be long gone by now.
598,00:31:15,00:31:17,"Well, please tell me you saw something."
599,00:31:20,00:31:21,I just want my family back.
600,00:31:21,00:31:23,But you didn't get them back!
601,00:31:23,00:31:25,You gave the kidnappers their money.
602,00:31:25,00:31:27,And now they're not worth anything anymore.
603,00:31:29,00:31:30,STOKES: Well...
604,00:31:30,00:31:32,let's just hope you didn't get your whole family killed.
605,00:31:39,00:31:40,"All right, I-I'll pass the word along."
606,00:31:40,00:31:42,See you when you're back. That was Nick.
607,00:31:42,00:31:47,"He said the ransom money is long gone and Lloyd, the shop owner, had no contact with whoever took it."
608,00:31:47,00:31:48,"Okay, so where's that leave us?"
609,00:31:48,00:31:50,Remi Volero's lawyered up.
610,00:31:50,00:31:55,"Right? So even if he knows where Dina Bryant and those kids are, he's not gonna say anything."
611,00:31:55,00:31:56,Any ideas?
612,00:31:56,00:31:58,"Well, I may have something."
613,00:31:58,00:32:00,It's gonna be vague though.
614,00:32:00,00:32:03,"The, uh, kidnappers have been really smart at communicating."
615,00:32:03,00:32:07,They use the victims' phones to send the initial videos and texts.
616,00:32:07,00:32:10,"And when they're not sending, they keep the phones turned off."
617,00:32:10,00:32:12,"Making it impossible to locate, right."
618,00:32:12,00:32:14,They contacted Lloyd tonight with the ransom demands.
619,00:32:14,00:32:16,How did they do that?
620,00:32:16,00:32:18,"Well, they sent an e-mail using Stuart Ball's phone."
621,00:32:18,00:32:20,It was on for less than 20 seconds.
622,00:32:20,00:32:26,I've been going through the cell carrier's cached data to try and pinpoint which cell tower they pinged.
623,00:32:27,00:32:30,There you go.
624,00:32:30,00:32:33,"Like I said, it's vague. No, no, that's a good start."
625,00:32:33,00:32:40,"Let's look real hard at this Remi Volero, see what we can link him to inside of that circle."
626,00:32:40,00:32:45,"BRODY: Now, I know Nick is the expert, but this just looks like a common crane fly to me."
627,00:32:45,00:32:47,They're everywhere in Vegas.
628,00:32:47,00:32:52,I don't know how they're gonna help us pinpoint where the van has been.
629,00:32:52,00:32:53,You having better luck on your side?
630,00:32:53,00:32:56,"You mean, am I having any better luck with the bird excrement?"
631,00:32:56,00:33:02,"It's not lost on me that, of all the trace that you pulled, you gave me the poop."
632,00:33:05,00:33:07,Interesting poop though.
633,00:33:07,00:33:10,Contains a poison called Meríasol.
634,00:33:10,00:33:12,Similar to hemlock.
635,00:33:12,00:33:16,"So the birds ate the poison, but they didn't die?"
636,00:33:16,00:33:18,"Meríasol is poisonous to humans, not to birds."
637,00:33:18,00:33:20,It comes from the berries they eat.
638,00:33:20,00:33:24,Where do the berries grow?
639,00:33:24,00:33:28,"Apparently, only in the rainforests."
640,00:33:28,00:33:31,Not in the middle of the Nevada desert.
641,00:33:31,00:33:33,Unless...
642,00:33:33,00:33:36,there is a rainforest in the middle of the Nevada desert.
643,00:33:36,00:33:40,The Mediterranean Casino has a rainforest garden.
644,00:33:40,00:33:41,100% humidity.
645,00:33:41,00:33:43,"I went there once, my hair went insane."
646,00:33:43,00:33:48,We just need to know if they have a Meríasol tree.
647,00:33:48,00:33:49,Put the Mediterranean on the map.
648,00:33:49,00:33:52,Why? It's not in the circle.
649,00:33:52,00:33:54,There were bird droppings on top of the van.
650,00:33:54,00:33:56,They contained a specific type of berry.
651,00:33:56,00:34:00,"Far as I can tell, it only grows at the Mediterranean."
652,00:34:00,00:34:02,You think the birds were feeding there?
653,00:34:02,00:34:03,"Yeah, probably starlings."
654,00:34:03,00:34:07,"According to the groundskeeper, those birds have been all over the berries."
655,00:34:07,00:34:11,"Now, uh, put a circle around the casino, quarter-mile radius."
656,00:34:11,00:34:16,"Apparently, starlings nest within a quarter mile of their food source."
657,00:34:16,00:34:19,That narrows the area way down.
658,00:34:19,00:34:24,"Greg, zoom in a little more, just the wedge."
659,00:34:26,00:34:29,"Volero owns something there, too, doesn't he?"
660,00:34:29,00:34:31,"Right here, off Bennett."
661,00:34:31,00:34:34,He bought it six months ago.
662,00:34:34,00:34:35,It's an old produce warehouse.
663,00:34:51,00:34:52,Morgan's starlings.
664,00:34:52,00:34:54,Yeah.
665,00:34:55,00:34:57,Nick.
666,00:35:16,00:35:18,CRAWFORD: It looks like a kidnapper's kit to me.
667,00:35:21,00:35:23,STOKES: Yup.
668,00:35:23,00:35:25,These are their phones. This is definitely the place.
669,00:35:25,00:35:27,"Hey, Nick, shh, shh. (quiet creaking)"
670,00:35:27,00:35:29,Listen.
671,00:35:32,00:35:33,(creaking continues)
672,00:35:37,00:35:39,"Oh, my God!"
673,00:35:39,00:35:41,"Mrs. Bryant, calm down. Are you okay?"
674,00:35:41,00:35:42,Where are you children? I don't know.
675,00:35:42,00:35:44,They're in some room somewhere.
676,00:35:46,00:35:47,What... Come with us.
677,00:35:47,00:35:48,Stay close. Okay.
678,00:35:48,00:35:51,(TV playing quietly)
679,00:35:55,00:35:57,Stay back.
680,00:36:02,00:36:05,"Oh, my God, my babies!"
681,00:36:05,00:36:06,My babies! My babies.
682,00:36:06,00:36:08,Mommy! My babies.
683,00:36:08,00:36:09,Everything's okay now.
684,00:36:09,00:36:12,Okay? I'm here. I'm here now.
685,00:36:12,00:36:14,Mommy. (mouthing)
686,00:36:14,00:36:16,"Let me see you. Oh, my God."
687,00:36:21,00:36:23,"Hi, guys."
688,00:36:23,00:36:25,Dina. Hi.
689,00:36:25,00:36:27,How are they doing?
690,00:36:27,00:36:29,"Uh, they seem okay, thank God."
691,00:36:29,00:36:31,"Uh, I'm gonna show you a photo lineup."
692,00:36:31,00:36:34,I want you to tell me if any of these men were involved in the kidnapping.
693,00:36:34,00:36:36,I-I... I can't.
694,00:36:36,00:36:37,"I mean, I never saw a face."
695,00:36:37,00:36:39,They always had masks on.
696,00:36:39,00:36:42,"That's okay, take a look anyway."
697,00:36:42,00:36:46,Maybe you've seen one of them in your neighborhood or around the kids' school or... (sighs)
698,00:36:46,00:36:49,Okay.
699,00:36:50,00:36:51,"I... No, I don't..."
700,00:36:51,00:36:53,"recognize any of these, I'm sorry."
701,00:36:57,00:36:58,They're here? They're okay?
702,00:36:58,00:37:01,"Yeah, yeah, they checked out just fine."
703,00:37:01,00:37:03,But I can't let you in there just yet.
704,00:37:03,00:37:05,"Why? Well, they still have to be processed."
705,00:37:05,00:37:07,What do you mean? I have to see them.
706,00:37:07,00:37:11,"I'm sorry, Lloyd, but Sara has to collect their clothes, give them a quick once-over."
707,00:37:11,00:37:16,"You know, even the smallest detail can help us catch the guys who did this to you."
708,00:37:16,00:37:18,So just... sit tight.
709,00:37:18,00:37:19,Yeah.
710,00:37:22,00:37:24,(whispers): Hi.
711,00:37:30,00:37:32,What's up?
712,00:37:32,00:37:35,Haven't you already analyzed every single frame of those?
713,00:37:35,00:37:37,Now I have more to work with.
714,00:37:37,00:37:39,All we had before were the five-second loops.
715,00:37:39,00:37:42,Now we have the phones that they were filmed on.
716,00:37:42,00:37:46,"It's only another second or two, but there are heads and tails on each."
717,00:37:46,00:37:52,"At the end of this one, the camera tilts up and catches just a piece of window."
718,00:37:52,00:37:54,And there's a reflection in it.
719,00:37:54,00:37:56,Maybe I can enhance it.
720,00:38:01,00:38:03,Looks like you're getting something.
721,00:38:05,00:38:07,I can see...
722,00:38:09,00:38:11,"Oh, my God, Greg."
723,00:38:14,00:38:18,Last 24 hours must have been pretty trying for you.
724,00:38:18,00:38:21,"Not at all what you expected when yesterday began, huh?"
725,00:38:21,00:38:26,"God, no. No, not in a million years could I have thought something like this could happen to us."
726,00:38:26,00:38:29,"No, no, you thought it'd be quick and easy, didn't you?"
727,00:38:29,00:38:32,Probably over in less than an hour.
728,00:38:32,00:38:35,You and Stuart would have the money.
729,00:38:35,00:38:38,Couldn't have guessed that Stuart's sister was gonna be shot.
730,00:38:38,00:38:44,"Right? I mean, you just thought she'd pick up the money, drop it off where you and Stuart told her to in the instructions."
731,00:38:44,00:38:46,(scoffs)
732,00:38:46,00:38:48,"That's-that's, uh..."
733,00:38:48,00:38:50,This is crazy. I...
734,00:38:50,00:38:50,(sighs)
735,00:38:50,00:38:55,"Mr. Russell, you can't honestly think that I was involved somehow?"
736,00:38:55,00:38:57,I was a victim.
737,00:38:57,00:38:59,My children were victims.
738,00:38:59,00:39:03,"Certainly looked that way in the video, I have to admit."
739,00:39:03,00:39:05,"I mean, that was... that was terrifying."
740,00:39:05,00:39:07,What was your plan if we hadn't found you in the warehouse?
741,00:39:07,00:39:09,What-What were you gonna do?
742,00:39:09,00:39:13,"Were you gonna miraculously escape and then flag down a car, dial 911?"
743,00:39:13,00:39:15,"You know, I-I don't need to listen to this..."
744,00:39:15,00:39:16,"Hey, you sit down."
745,00:39:22,00:39:25,"Look, I have been through hell."
746,00:39:25,00:39:30,"Okay? And I just... I want to go home, and I want to be with my family."
747,00:39:30,00:39:34,"Mrs. Bryant, we know that you and Stuart filmed the video."
748,00:39:34,00:39:36,Just the two of you.
749,00:39:36,00:39:38,No kidnappers. No Remi Volero.
750,00:39:38,00:39:40,You filmed each other.
751,00:39:40,00:39:43,"I mean, that is you, isn't it?"
752,00:39:43,00:39:45,Uh...
753,00:39:45,00:39:50,"Look, you... you have to know that I didn't want to do any of this."
754,00:39:50,00:39:51,It was Stuart. No.
755,00:39:51,00:39:52,"No, no, he-he forced me."
756,00:39:52,00:39:56,Stuart was just some young kid that you tricked into helping you.
757,00:39:56,00:39:58,"No, he... Stuart had a gun."
758,00:39:58,00:40:00,And he threatened to hurt us.
759,00:40:00,00:40:03,"Well, he didn't have the gun when you shot him in the head though, did he?"
760,00:40:06,00:40:11,"See, what you don't realize is that we found Stuart's blood on the sleeve of your sweater."
761,00:40:11,00:40:15,"Mrs. Bryant, we have all the evidence we need."
762,00:40:15,00:40:17,You're done.
763,00:40:20,00:40:25,"Mr. Russell, you look the other way on this..."
764,00:40:26,00:40:30,...and half of what I have...
765,00:40:30,00:40:31,is yours.
766,00:40:31,00:40:37,"Mrs. Bryant, you have absolutely nothing I want."
767,00:40:41,00:40:44,"Man, she's a piece of work. Mm."
768,00:40:44,00:40:47,"She's not gonna say where the money is. Well, she thinks it's gonna be waiting for her when she gets out."
769,00:40:49,00:40:51,"Only, she's never getting out."
770,00:41:08,00:41:12,RUSSELL: I'm starting to wonder if something's changed.
771,00:41:12,00:41:20,Some ripple of inhumanity has built into this wave of cruelty and indifference.
772,00:41:20,00:41:23,Feel like we're being swallowed by this darkness.
773,00:41:23,00:41:25,"FINLAY: Mm. That bad, huh?"
774,00:41:25,00:41:28,(chuckles)
775,00:41:28,00:41:31,"I'm a little moody today, I'll give you that."
776,00:41:31,00:41:33,"I could use some good news, Jules."
777,00:41:33,00:41:35,I wish I had something for you.
778,00:41:35,00:41:40,"But the, uh... records clerk up here hasn't exactly been cooperative."
779,00:41:40,00:41:42,But I will get you Briscoe's foster care files.
780,00:41:42,00:41:43,Don't you worry.
781,00:41:43,00:41:45,I'm just gonna have to be a little bit more clever.
782,00:41:45,00:41:48,All right. Do me a favor though.
783,00:41:48,00:41:50,Don't get into any trouble.
784,00:41:50,00:41:52,You have history up there.
785,00:41:52,00:41:53,I wouldn't dream of it.
786,00:41:53,00:41:55,"Hey, hey, hey, I'm serious. (phone chimes)"
787,00:41:55,00:41:57,You be careful.
788,00:42:01,00:42:04,"All right, I'll call you as soon as I have something."
789,00:42:04,00:42:06,Take care of yourself.
790,00:42:06,00:42:07,Always.
791,00:42:07,00:42:09,Bye.
792,00:42:09,00:42:09,Bye.
