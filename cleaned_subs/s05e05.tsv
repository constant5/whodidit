0	0	00:00:18	00:00:19	Honey, slow down.	N
1	1	00:00:24	00:00:25	Hold on a second. Hold on.	N
2	2	00:00:25	00:00:27	Leave it alone. We're already late.	N
3	3	00:00:27	00:00:29	If you hadn't told the sitter the wrong time...	N
4	4	00:00:29	00:00:30	How do I look?	N
5	5	00:00:30	00:00:32	You look great.	N
6	6	00:00:34	00:00:36	Hello. Sorry we're late.	N
7	7	00:00:36	00:00:38	No, I'm so glad you guys could make it.	N
8	8	00:00:44	00:00:46	You guys want a drink?	N
9	9	00:01:08	00:01:10	Mm...	N
10	10	00:01:33	00:01:34	Hey, fellas, what's the holdup?	N
11	11	00:01:34	00:01:35	Come on.	N
12	12	00:01:35	00:01:38	I told you half an hour ago turn the damn fountain off!	N
13	13	00:01:38	00:01:39	Give me a break.	N
14	14	00:01:39	00:01:41	You can't find good help.	N
15	15	00:01:41	00:01:46	As Lord Byron once said, In the desert, a fountain is springing.	N
16	16	00:01:46	00:01:48	Well, this one sprung a dead woman...	N
17	17	00:01:48	00:01:50	Vanessa Keaton.	N
18	18	00:01:50	00:01:52	She lived over there.	N
19	19	00:01:52	00:01:55	A neighbor walking her dog found her.	N
20	20	00:01:59	00:02:01	This is a pretty well-dressed crowd for this time of night.	N
21	21	00:02:01	00:02:02	Well, you know, it's a shindig.	N
22	22	00:02:02	00:02:04	43 Niagara Circle.	N
23	23	00:02:04	00:02:06	The vic was there with her husband.	Y
24	24	00:02:06	00:02:10	Left the party early.	Y
25	25	00:02:10	00:02:12	That's Dan Keaton, and that's his daughter Amy.	N
26	26	00:02:12	00:02:16	You know, you might want to sneak some photos of this crowd.	N
27	27	00:02:16	00:02:20	A gated community, middle of nowhere-- if this wasn't an accident, they're all suspects, aren't they?	N
28	28	00:02:30	00:02:33	Foam in her nose and mouth.	N
29	29	00:02:33	00:02:34	It's consistent with drowning.	N
30	30	00:02:35	00:02:37	Abrasion on her forehead is fresh.	N
31	31	00:02:39	00:02:43	And lividity is unfixed.	N
32	32	00:02:43	00:02:46	Well, since water motion has no effect...	N
33	33	00:02:46	00:02:48	She's been dead less than two hours.	N
34	34	00:02:48	00:02:50	Thank you. Finally!	N
35	35	00:02:51	00:02:53	Still waters run deep.	N
36	36	00:03:31	00:03:33	I can't do this right now.	N
37	37	00:03:33	00:03:34	What, a little hungover?	N
38	38	00:03:34	00:03:36	Too much to drink, maybe?	N
39	39	00:03:36	00:03:39	We'll have a police officer get you some water.	N
40	40	00:03:39	00:03:41	Bernie.	N
41	41	00:03:41	00:03:43	So, the last time you saw your wife was at the party?	N
42	42	00:03:43	00:03:45	Erin and Paul Brady's.	N
43	43	00:03:45	00:03:47	But you left early without your wife, right?	N
44	44	00:03:49	00:03:51	Yeah, I wasn't in the mood.	Y
45	45	00:03:51	00:03:53	She was.	Y
46	46	00:03:53	00:03:54	For what?	N
47	47	00:03:54	00:03:57	Partying.	Y
48	48	00:03:58	00:04:00	What time did you leave?	Y
49	49	00:04:01	00:04:04	00, I think.	Y
50	50	00:04:04	00:04:05	Anyone see you come home?	Y
51	51	00:04:05	00:04:06	Maybe your daughter? This is Amy, right?	Y
52	52	00:04:06	00:04:07	I went out with friends.	N
53	53	00:04:07	00:04:10	00. I was a little late.	N
54	54	00:04:10	00:04:13	So, Amy, did you see your parents when you came in?	Y
55	55	00:04:13	00:04:15	My mom was in Detroit.	Y
56	56	00:04:15	00:04:17	Vanessa's my stepmom.	N
57	57	00:04:18	00:04:20	The TV was on in their room.	N
58	58	00:04:20	00:04:22	I snuck into my room and went to bed.	N
59	59	00:04:22	00:04:24	The sirens woke me up.	N
60	60	00:04:25	00:04:27	The sirens, huh?	N
61	61	00:04:28	00:04:31	You know, they never go home until they see the body taken away?	N
62	62	00:04:31	00:04:33	Necrophilic voyeurism.	N
63	63	00:04:41	00:04:42	Hot shoes.	N
64	64	00:04:42	00:04:43	You think these are sexy, huh?	N
65	65	00:04:43	00:04:56	Did you know that shoes like these put degenerative stress on the hip joints, throw off the curve of the spine, and the tilt to the pelvis, over time, women get headaches, sore backs, shortened calf muscles and bunions, of course.	N
66	66	00:04:56	00:04:58	I take it back.	N
67	67	00:04:59	00:05:00	First thoughts?	N
68	68	00:05:00	00:05:02	Vanessa Keaton was walking home.	N
69	69	00:05:02	00:05:05	She had a few. Her feet hurt.	N
70	70	00:05:05	00:05:06	She takes off her shoes.	N
71	71	00:05:06	00:05:09	Dolce vida.	N
72	72	00:05:14	00:05:15	There's no sign of blood or hair.	N
73	73	00:05:15	00:05:17	Nothing to suggest contact.	N
74	74	00:05:17	00:05:18	The fountain was on.	N
75	75	00:05:18	00:05:21	Maybe the action of the water washed away evidence.	N
76	76	00:05:21	00:05:23	How do we know it was an accident?	N
77	77	00:05:23	00:05:24	Maybe she wasn't alone.	N
78	78	00:05:26	00:05:27	We don't know that.	N
79	79	00:05:27	00:05:30	We're going to need a water sample and a bag for the shoe, of course.	N
80	80	00:05:30	00:05:32	Okay.	N
81	81	00:05:39	00:05:40	You okay to drive?	N
82	82	00:05:40	00:05:42	No.	N
83	83	00:05:42	00:05:46	After a triple and three back-to-back scenes, I'm tired.	N
84	84	00:05:46	00:05:48	I'm going to take a ten in the car before we head back.	N
85	85	00:05:48	00:05:51	That's better than bouncing off the curb, I guess.	N
86	86	00:05:51	00:05:52	Yeah.	N
87	87	00:05:52	00:05:56	Okay, you ready to run it?	N
88	88	00:05:56	00:05:58	Sure.	N
89	89	00:05:58	00:06:04	Landlord's working late, trying to fix up the place for the new tenant, kicking up dust, paint fumes.	N
90	90	00:06:04	00:06:06	Door's open for ventilation.	N
91	91	00:06:06	00:06:07	Killer strolls in.	N
92	92	00:06:07	00:06:10	Next thing you know, landlord's deli meat.	N
93	93	00:06:16	00:06:18	Well, we have this eviction notice.	N
94	94	00:06:18	00:06:20	So, that means no business.	N
95	95	00:06:20	00:06:24	No business, no cash, so that could rule out robbery as a motive.	N
96	96	00:06:24	00:06:27	I'm having Detective Cavalier run down the evicted tenants.	N
97	97	00:06:27	00:06:31	It's a Melissa Pooley and a Charlie Pincher.	N
98	98	00:06:31	00:06:32	Sorry, can't let you in.	N
99	99	00:06:34	00:06:36	Hey, you guys call yourselves investigators?	N
100	100	00:06:36	00:06:38	You've been here four hours.	N
101	101	00:06:38	00:06:39	You haven't figured this out yet?	N
102	102	00:06:39	00:06:40	Crime scene cleanup.	N
103	103	00:06:40	00:06:42	Blood bucket brigade.	N
104	104	00:06:42	00:06:45	Hey, I prefer bio- recovery services.	N
105	105	00:06:45	00:06:46	You know, it's funny.	N
106	106	00:06:46	00:06:48	I don't see an American Bio-Recovery badge.	N
107	107	00:06:48	00:06:55	See, all you really need is a strong stomach, a thorough knowledge of solvents, a little sensitivity, a little tact.	N
108	108	00:06:55	00:06:56	Whoa.	N
109	109	00:06:56	00:06:59	Man!	N
110	110	00:06:59	00:07:02	There must be three quarts of blood in there.	N
111	111	00:07:02	00:07:04	Hey, you're using anhydron.	N
112	112	00:07:04	00:07:06	I charge extra for that.	N
113	113	00:07:06	00:07:08	Cha-ching, cha-ching.	N
114	114	00:07:08	00:07:11	You got photos, swabs.	N
115	115	00:07:12	00:07:13	Did you finish the sketch?	N
116	116	00:07:13	00:07:14	Yeah.	N
117	117	00:07:14	00:07:15	Great.	N
118	118	00:07:15	00:07:18	Hey, you guys have done everything but leave.	N
119	119	00:07:18	00:07:20	What's the rush, Marty?	N
120	120	00:07:20	00:07:25	The wife of the deceased, she would like this mess cleaned up as soon as possible.	N
121	121	00:07:25	00:07:27	New tenant moves in on the first.	N
122	122	00:07:27	00:07:28	Okay, Marty.	N
123	123	00:07:28	00:07:30	I'll have the detective release the scene.	N
124	124	00:07:30	00:07:34	Well, I'll get my gear.	N
125	125	00:07:36	00:07:40	One of the most attractive women I've had on my table.	N
126	126	00:07:40	00:07:45	But beauty's skin deep and inside, we all look pretty much the same.	N
127	127	00:07:45	00:07:48	What about this abrasion?	N
128	128	00:07:48	00:07:50	Have you no poet in you?	N
129	129	00:07:50	00:07:51	Beauty is truth, truth, beauty.	N
130	130	00:07:52	00:07:55	That is all you know on Earth and all you need to know-- except cause of death.	N
131	131	00:07:55	00:07:57	Pulmonary edema due to drowning.	N
132	132	00:07:57	00:08:00	I sent samples of the water in her lungs to Trace.	N
133	133	00:08:00	00:08:03	The abrasion's serious enough to cause loss of consciousness.	N
134	134	00:08:03	00:08:04	You may want to look at this though.	N
135	135	00:08:04	00:08:06	You want to come over here?	N
136	136	00:08:06	00:08:08	Let's turn her over.	N
137	137	00:08:16	00:08:17	Puncture wounds?	N
138	138	00:08:17	00:08:21	Four, uniform diameter, perimortem, non-lethal.	N
139	139	00:08:21	00:08:23	No corresponding holes in her dress.	N
140	140	00:08:23	00:08:26	So she wasn't wearing it when she was stabbed.	N
141	141	00:08:26	00:08:28	Collected lubricant from the labia.	N
142	142	00:08:28	00:08:30	Which means, uh...	N
143	143	00:08:30	00:08:34	I don't know if she had a date with her husband or herself.	N
144	144	00:08:34	00:08:36	I sent an SAE kit to DNA.	N
145	145	00:08:36	00:08:43	Personal observation-- you don't wear La Perla to a Tupperware party.	Y
146	146	00:08:43	00:08:45	La Perla?	Y
147	147	00:08:46	00:08:47	Very expensive.	N
148	148	00:08:47	00:08:49	I gave some to my wife once.	N
149	149	00:08:49	00:08:51	She accused me of having an affair.	Y
150	150	00:08:51	00:08:53	You know, sex on the steel.	Y
151	151	00:08:55	00:08:57	Lubricant and lingerie.	N
152	152	00:08:57	00:09:01	I don't think the evening turned out the way she planned, do you?	Y
153	153	00:09:01	00:09:03	Nope.	Y
154	154	00:09:05	00:09:07	So your business goes bust and Mr. Visingi evicts you.	Y
155	155	00:09:08	00:09:10	Pac-Man, Pong, loved these games.	Y
156	156	00:09:10	00:09:12	Thought it was a sure thing.	Y
157	157	00:09:12	00:09:13	Well, today, it's all 3-D interactive.	Y
158	158	00:09:13	00:09:14	You know, I got kids.	Y
159	159	00:09:14	00:09:16	You want some advice? No.	Y
160	160	00:09:16	00:09:18	Never go into business with somebody you're sleeping with.	Y
161	161	00:09:18	00:09:20	Melissa Pooley? Bitch.	Y
162	162	00:09:20	00:09:22	We haven't been able to find her.	Y
163	163	00:09:23	00:09:24	You know where she is?	Y
164	164	00:09:24	00:09:26	We broke up. At least I think we broke up.	Y
165	165	00:09:26	00:09:29	She skipped town without telling me, stuck me with the rent.	Y
166	166	00:09:29	00:09:32	So you were angry at her, you were angry at him.	Y
167	167	00:09:32	00:09:33	I didn't kill him.	Y
168	168	00:09:33	00:09:36	He was holding your inventory hostage.	Y
169	169	00:09:36	00:09:38	How much you got tied up in Centipede and Space Invaders?	Y
170	170	00:09:38	00:09:40	Every penny I got.	Y
171	171	00:09:40	00:09:41	About 20K.	N
172	172	00:09:41	00:09:43	You must have wanted it back.	Y
173	173	00:09:43	00:09:47	Hey, did you stop by the store last night?	Y
174	174	00:09:47	00:09:50	No, but I called him.	N
175	175	00:09:50	00:09:52	Asked if we could maybe work something out.	N
176	176	00:09:52	00:09:55	Told me to go screw myself, he'd see me in court.	N
177	177	00:09:55	00:09:58	Mr. Pincher, I'm going to need to go ahead and get your fingerprints.	N
178	178	00:10:01	00:10:03	You're going to find my prints all over that place.	N
179	179	00:10:03	00:10:05	It was my store, mine and Melissa's.	N
180	180	00:10:05	00:10:08	I expect to find your prints in certain places, sir.	N
181	181	00:10:08	00:10:10	We're just doing this to rule you out.	N
182	182	00:10:10	00:10:13	Oh.	N
183	183	00:10:21	00:10:24	You alternate hands when you double glove?	N
184	184	00:10:24	00:10:25	Yes.	N
185	185	00:10:25	00:10:27	And I don't like being watched.	N
186	186	00:10:27	00:10:34	If you alternate, there's more contact between the exposed latex of the first glove and atmospheric microbes.	N
187	187	00:10:35	00:10:37	What?	N
188	188	00:10:38	00:10:48	You know, it would have been better if you didn't say anything, but you did making it impossible for me to concentrate, and now I have to sanitize and start over.	N
189	189	00:10:48	00:10:52	Hey, Hodges, you got the results of our drowning victim?	N
190	190	00:10:52	00:10:53	Yeah, in five.	N
191	191	00:10:53	00:10:55	I'm in the middle of the rest of my life.	N
192	192	00:10:55	00:10:57	Well, I kind of need them now.	N
193	193	00:11:00	00:11:02	I'll be back.	N
194	194	00:11:03	00:11:07	Good thing you didn't have to take a spelling test to work the field.	N
195	195	00:11:07	00:11:08	Funtain water?	N
196	196	00:11:09	00:11:11	My people are Norwegian.	N
197	197	00:11:11	00:11:12	That's how we spell it.	N
198	198	00:11:14	00:11:16	So, is the funtain water in her lungs?	N
199	199	00:11:16	00:11:18	All bodies of water contain unicellular algae.	N
200	200	00:11:18	00:11:20	Called diatoms.	N
201	201	00:11:20	00:11:21	They're unique, like fingerprints.	N
202	202	00:11:21	00:11:24	Diatoms from one body of water don't match those from any other.	N
203	203	00:11:24	00:11:25	Well, you're roughly right.	N
204	204	00:11:25	00:11:27	Here, take a look.	N
205	205	00:11:29	00:11:34	The diatoms on the left are from the water found in your victim's lungs and the diatoms on the right are from the fountain.	N
206	206	00:11:34	00:11:35	Not a match.	N
207	207	00:11:35	00:11:37	Not even close.	N
208	208	00:11:37	00:11:39	Which means she didn't drown there.	N
209	209	00:11:39	00:11:41	I'll throw you a bone.	N
210	210	00:11:41	00:11:44	She blew you off, didn't she?	Y
211	211	00:11:44	00:11:46	The water from the fountain is heavily chlorinated.	Y
212	212	00:11:46	00:11:47	No, she didn't blow me off.	N
213	213	00:11:47	00:11:48	I didn't ask her out.	N
214	214	00:11:48	00:11:53	But this sample, found in your vic's lungs, contains polymethylhexalene biguanide...	N
215	215	00:11:53	00:11:55	and anyway, I heard she blew you off first.	N
216	216	00:11:55	00:11:57	It's a chlorine alternative.	N
217	217	00:11:57	00:11:58	It's less irritating.	N
218	218	00:11:58	00:12:00	Vanessa Keaton died in a pool.	N
219	219	00:12:00	00:12:01	Or a spa...	N
220	220	00:12:01	00:12:06	And by the way, that's spelled S-P-A in any language.	N
221	221	00:12:06	00:12:13	Only new items brought into the arcade post-eviction were the tools, tarps and paint cans.	Y
222	222	00:12:13	00:12:15	No prints from Charlie Pincher on any of them.	N
223	223	00:12:15	00:12:19	Just the landlord and some unknowns on the saw.	N
224	224	00:12:19	00:12:21	No hits off of AFIS.	N
225	225	00:12:21	00:12:24	According to Cavalier, the table saw was a rental.	N
226	226	00:12:24	00:12:27	So, there could have been any number of prints on that one.	N
227	227	00:12:27	00:12:29	Yeah, but you don't just lie down when somebody's trying to kill you, man.	N
228	228	00:12:30	00:12:31	There had to have been a struggle.	N
229	229	00:12:31	00:12:33	Yeah, from that spinning blade, there was blood everywhere.	N
230	230	00:12:33	00:12:37	Some of it had to transfer to the killer's clothes and shoes.	N
231	231	00:12:37	00:12:39	I still like Charlie for this.	N
232	232	00:12:39	00:12:43	I know we don't have enough Excuse me, guys.	N
233	233	00:12:43	00:12:45	There's a Mr. Gleason to see you.	N
234	234	00:12:45	00:12:47	I told him you were busy.	N
235	235	00:12:47	00:12:48	He won't leave.	N
236	236	00:12:50	00:12:52	What's the problem, Marty?	N
237	237	00:12:52	00:12:54	You and you.	N
238	238	00:12:54	00:12:56	You treat me like a janitor, like a garbage man.	N
239	239	00:12:57	00:12:59	I'm a professional, same as you...	N
240	240	00:12:59	00:13:02	an unsung hero that's worthy of respect.	N
241	241	00:13:02	00:13:03	Okay, Marty...	N
242	242	00:13:03	00:13:06	You know exactly what I'm talking about.	N
243	243	00:13:06	00:13:07	The smell back at the store.	N
244	244	00:13:07	00:13:10	I know decomp as well as you, maybe better, okay?	N
245	245	00:13:10	00:13:11	So what was it?	N
246	246	00:13:11	00:13:13	Your lunch?	N
247	247	00:13:13	00:13:15	Rotten shrimp? Clams, maybe?	N
248	248	00:13:15	00:13:18	Whatever you hid there, I am going to find.	N
249	249	00:13:18	00:13:19	We didn't even bring lunch there, Marty.	N
250	250	00:13:19	00:13:21	And this wasn't a decomp scene.	N
251	251	00:13:21	00:13:22	You're jealous.	N
252	252	00:13:22	00:13:29	You're stuck in a dead-end civil service job while I'm grossing six figures.	N
253	253	00:13:29	00:13:30	Oh, six figures.	N
254	254	00:13:30	00:13:31	Yeah. Picture that.	N
255	255	00:13:31	00:13:32	We're colleagues.	N
256	256	00:13:32	00:13:36	My job starts where your job ends.	N
257	257	00:13:36	00:13:38	You should not be messing with me!	N
258	258	00:13:38	00:13:40	Nobody's messing with you, Marty.	N
259	259	00:13:50	00:13:52	Phew... ooh...	N
260	260	00:13:54	00:13:55	It's decomp.	N
261	261	00:13:55	00:13:57	Subtle, but it's in here.	N
262	262	00:13:57	00:13:59	The nose knows.	N
263	263	00:13:59	00:14:00	How'd we miss that?	N
264	264	00:14:00	00:14:02	We were tired.	N
265	265	00:14:04	00:14:05	Did you steam clean?	N
266	266	00:14:05	00:14:09	Yeah. The heating process must have brought the smell out.	N
267	267	00:14:09	00:14:15	You know, I don't get paid until this place smells like Eternity for Men.	Y
268	268	00:14:19	00:14:20	Could be a dead rat.	N
269	269	00:14:20	00:14:23	Lot of possibilities.	N
270	270	00:14:23	00:14:25	I don't know.	Y
271	271	00:14:25	00:14:27	Your guess is as good as mine.	Y
272	272	00:14:30	00:14:31	I know how to find it.	N
273	273	00:14:40	00:14:41	Okay, rich guy.	N
274	274	00:14:41	00:14:45	Shut down your gear, you're taking us to lunch.	N
275	275	00:14:48	00:14:49	Crack runs right through the deep end.	N
276	276	00:14:50	00:14:51	Had to drain it.	N
277	277	00:14:51	00:14:55	Half the neighbors have cracked slabs, leaky roofs.	N
278	278	00:14:55	00:14:59	This was perfect when Vanessa and I moved in.	N
279	279	00:14:59	00:15:01	Place isn't built to last.	N
280	280	00:15:01	00:15:05	Mr. Keaton, I know this must be hard for you and your daughter.	Y

282	282	00:15:07	00:15:10	Your wife didn't die in a fountain.	N
283	283	00:15:10	00:15:13	We're taking water samples of every pool and spa in this community.	N
284	284	00:15:13	00:15:15	Was there swimming at the Brady's party?	N
285	285	00:15:15	00:15:17	Why?	N
286	286	00:15:17	00:15:18	Routine question.	N
287	287	00:15:18	00:15:21	Some, I guess.	N
288	288	00:15:21	00:15:23	It was that kind of party.	N
289	289	00:15:23	00:15:24	Was your wife in the pool?	N
290	290	00:15:24	00:15:25	She could have been.	N
291	291	00:15:25	00:15:27	After I left.	N
292	292	00:15:27	00:15:30	What does this have to do with her accident?	N
293	293	00:15:30	00:15:33	Did anyone behave inappropriately towards her?	N
294	294	00:15:33	00:15:37	We were with our friends.	N
295	295	00:15:37	00:15:38	Our best friends.	N
296	296	00:15:38	00:15:42	I wouldn't have left her there if I didn't think she was safe.	N
297	297	00:15:48	00:15:50	No one's allowed to treat their pools with chlorine.	N
298	298	00:15:50	00:15:51	It's in the homeowners' regulations.	N
299	299	00:15:51	00:15:52	What the hell is going on?	N
300	300	00:15:52	00:15:53	They have a warrant.	N
301	301	00:15:53	00:15:55	A warrant for what?	N
302	302	00:15:55	00:15:57	When was the last time you had your pool cleaned?	N
303	303	00:15:57	00:15:59	Guy was here this morning. Why?	N
304	304	00:15:59	00:16:01	We're asking the questions, Mr. Brady.	N
305	305	00:16:02	00:16:04	Look, look... we're all in shock.	N

308	308	00:16:11	00:16:13	We just had the neighbors in for cocktails.	N
309	309	00:16:14	00:16:15	We do it once a month.	N
310	310	00:16:15	00:16:16	We, uh... we all take turns.	N
311	311	00:16:17	00:16:19	Was Mrs. Keaton wearing this dress last night?	N
312	312	00:16:19	00:16:21	Yes.	N
313	313	00:16:22	00:16:24	I noticed-- I have the same one in pink.	N
314	314	00:16:24	00:16:26	You notice anything else, anything out of the ordinary?	N
315	315	00:16:26	00:16:28	Like an argument or a fight?	N
316	316	00:16:28	00:16:31	No, no, no. We are a friendly group.	N

331	331	00:17:57	00:17:59	I don't know.	N
332	332	00:18:25	00:18:29	Well, cleanliness is next to godliness.	N
333	333	00:18:38	00:18:47	After overhead and costs, 50 cents a pound for waste disposal, I clear about three to five bills a job.	N
334	334	00:18:47	00:18:49	How many cases do you get a week?	N
335	335	00:18:49	00:18:52	How many cases do you do a week?	N

371	371	00:21:02	00:21:05	The plastic must have covered the smell.	N
372	372	00:21:09	00:21:10	Oh!	N
373	373	00:21:23	00:21:25	Holy mackerel. Bitch in a box.	N

378	378	00:21:37	00:21:41	And a partridge in a pear tree.	N
379	379	00:21:41	00:21:47	Some kids are happy playing in the sand box, others want every toy in the store.	N
380	380	00:21:47	00:21:49	And apparently these are dishwasher safe.	N
381	381	00:21:49	00:21:54	I'll swab the nooks and crannies for semen, vaginal secretions and epithelials, but don't get your hopes up.	N
382	382	00:21:54	00:21:56	Oh, my money's on bag number two.	N
383	383	00:21:56	00:21:58	26 used condoms.	N
384	384	00:21:58	00:22:00	Just like being back in college, right?	N
385	385	00:22:00	00:22:03	Sara said you didn't lose your virginity until you were 22.	N
386	386	00:22:05	00:22:09	Grissom and I figured that they practiced safe sex, so we processed their trash.	N
387	387	00:22:09	00:22:10	Check them inside and out, please.	N
388	388	00:22:10	00:22:13	I've analyzed condoms before, Greg.	N
389	389	00:22:13	00:22:14	Just not in bulk.	N
390	390	00:22:19	00:22:20	Skewers?	N
391	391	00:22:20	00:22:22	Yeah, screen them for blood.	N
392	392	00:22:22	00:22:23	Possible weapon.	N
393	393	00:23:28	00:23:31	Dental records ID'd the body found in the arcade machine.	N
394	394	00:23:31	00:23:34	Your ex-girlfriend Melissa Pooley.	Y

397	397	00:23:37	00:23:40	We also found semen in her vaginal cavity.	Y
398	398	00:23:41	00:23:42	It matches your dead landlord.	N
399	399	00:23:42	00:23:46	Your girlfriend was paying rent on her back and you didn't like it.	N
400	400	00:23:46	00:23:47	You had sex with our landlord?	Y
401	401	00:23:47	00:23:50	At least I got off my ass and did something about it.	Y
402	402	00:23:54	00:23:55	That didn't happen.	N
403	403	00:23:55	00:23:58	She told me she convinced Visingi to give us more time on the rent.	N
404	404	00:23:58	00:23:59	I-I didn't know she was banging the guy.	N
405	405	00:23:59	00:24:01	We don't care why you killed her.	N
406	406	00:24:01	00:24:02	I didn't kill her!	N
407	407	00:24:02	00:24:07	Visingi evicts you, keeps your stuff and now you've got a big problem.	N
408	408	00:24:07	00:24:10	Yeah, the dead body someone crammed into Ms. Pac-Man.	N
409	409	00:24:10	00:24:14	You can keep the rest of it! All I want is Ms. Pac-Man!	Y
410	410	00:24:14	00:24:15	Get the hell out of here.	Y
411	411	00:24:21	00:24:29	Mr. Pincher, when someone is killed with a table saw, blood gets everywhere-- your hair and your clothes.	Y
412	412	00:24:29	00:24:34	You would have had to take a long, hot shower, wash your clothes, clip your nails, toss your shoes.	N
413	413	00:24:34	00:24:39	Are you sure you got it all, Charlie?	N
414	414	00:24:39	00:24:42	Hmm?	N
415	415	00:24:44	00:24:45	That's a nice watch.	N
416	416	00:24:45	00:24:48	It was my dad's.	N
417	417	00:24:48	00:24:49	I was admiring the band.	N
418	418	00:24:50	00:24:53	Lots of open spaces and nonporous surfaces.	N
419	419	00:24:53	00:24:56	That's a perfect place for blood to hide, don't you think, Greg?	N
420	420	00:24:56	00:24:57	Yeah.	N
421	421	00:24:57	00:24:59	There's a chemical I use called phenylthaline.	N
422	422	00:24:59	00:25:03	It can detect a speck of blood the size of a pinprick.	N
423	423	00:25:06	00:25:09	I bet if I take that watch it's going to tell me more than time, isn't it?	N
424	424	00:25:13	00:25:16	You mind baby-sitting him while I get a warrant?	N
425	425	00:25:16	00:25:17	I just went to the arcade to scare him.	N
426	426	00:25:17	00:25:20	Things got out of hand. Did you kill him?	N
427	427	00:25:20	00:25:21	It was an accident.	N
428	428	00:25:21	00:25:24	You guys have got to believe me, I did not kill Melissa.	N
429	429	00:25:24	00:25:25	I didn't even know she was dead.	N
430	430	00:25:32	00:25:35	I know that you got the memo, I'm not sure that you read it.	N
431	431	00:25:35	00:25:38	Eckley is being promoted to Assistant Director.	N
432	432	00:25:38	00:25:42	They are taking applications for his supervisor spot on days. I want it.	N
433	433	00:25:44	00:25:45	What?	N
434	434	00:25:45	00:25:46	You want the day spot for yourself?	N
435	435	00:25:46	00:25:50	You're worried about giving me a good A.P. score and breaking up the team?	N
436	436	00:25:50	00:25:53	Or maybe you just think that I'm incapable of the position?	N
437	437	00:25:53	00:25:54	Not worthy of the promotion?	N
438	438	00:25:54	00:25:55	Is that it?	N
439	439	00:25:55	00:26:00	I'm just always, always, always defending myself to you.	N
440	440	00:26:00	00:26:01	Unbelievable.	N
441	441	00:26:01	00:26:08	I have a daughter who is so starved for my attention, she is thumbing rides to Fremont street to see her grandfather.	N
442	442	00:26:08	00:26:10	The last person I want her around.	N
443	443	00:26:10	00:26:15	I mean, not that it's much better with my mother, who sees Lindsay much more often than I do.	N
444	444	00:26:15	00:26:18	I am missing out on my daughter's life.	N
445	445	00:26:18	00:26:20	I have no life of my own.	N
446	446	00:26:20	00:26:24	Would you just stop me and say something here?	N
447	447	00:26:27	00:26:30	You want the job because you're worried about Lindsay?	N
448	448	00:26:32	00:26:35	That's part of it, but...	N
449	449	00:26:35	00:26:37	The position calls for leadership, Catherine.	N
450	450	00:26:37	00:26:44	You have to inspire others, solve problems, which means you have to leave your own problems at home.	N
451	451	00:26:44	00:26:47	I want the job because I can do it.	N
452	452	00:26:47	00:26:50	I'm qualified, I'm motivated and I'm ready, Gil.	N
453	453	00:26:51	00:26:52	You know that I am.	N
454	454	00:26:52	00:26:54	I do.	N
455	455	00:26:54	00:26:56	Which is why I already sent in your A.P.	N
456	456	00:26:57	00:26:57	I gave you 100%.	N
457	457	00:26:58	00:27:00	I even put in a good word with the director.	N
458	458	00:27:00	00:27:02	The rest is up to you.	N
459	459	00:27:03	00:27:05	And...	N
460	460	00:27:05	00:27:07	I hope you get it.	N
461	461	00:27:14	00:27:15	Thank you.	N
462	462	00:27:53	00:27:58	I couldn't get anything from the items in the dishwasher, including the skewers. No results.	N
463	463	00:27:58	00:28:00	However, the condoms produced.	N
464	464	00:28:00	00:28:01	I extracted DNA from the semen.	N
465	465	00:28:01	00:28:04	Results indicate ten males.	N
466	466	00:28:04	00:28:10	The lubricant, which seemed to be popular, was good at retaining both epithelials and vaginal secretions.	N
467	467	00:28:10	00:28:12	11 females, no CODIS hits.	N
468	468	00:28:12	00:28:14	Is our victim represented?	N
469	469	00:28:14	00:28:15	Yes. F-7.	N
470	470	00:28:15	00:28:19	We can match her with the semen from four different males.	N
471	471	00:28:20	00:28:22	M-4, M-5, M-1, M-8.	N
472	472	00:28:24	00:28:27	She was the belle of the ball.	N
473	473	00:28:27	00:28:31	My husband and I have a very strong marriage.	N
474	474	00:28:31	00:28:35	But yes, we enjoy the lifestyle.	N
475	475	00:28:35	00:28:36	The lifestyle?	N
476	476	00:28:37	00:28:38	We play.	N
477	477	00:28:39	00:28:41	Swing.	N
478	478	00:28:42	00:28:44	Wife swapping.	Y
479	479	00:28:44	00:28:48	Paul and I had a rough patch a few years ago.	Y
480	480	00:28:48	00:28:50	We almost called it quits.	N
481	481	00:28:50	00:28:53	Swinging saved our marriage.	N
482	482	00:28:53	00:29:00	It was being with other people that made me realize just how much I love my husband.	N
483	483	00:29:01	00:29:05	Erin is the greatest wife in the world.	N
484	484	00:29:05	00:29:07	But you still had sex with Vanessa Keaton?	N
485	485	00:29:07	00:29:09	Yeah. Yeah.	N
486	486	00:29:10	00:29:12	It's fun.	N
487	487	00:29:17	00:29:20	How do you feel about Vanessa Keaton?	N
488	488	00:29:20	00:29:22	Very attractive woman.	N
489	489	00:29:22	00:29:26	She was the reason we invited the Keatons to the parties.	N
490	490	00:29:26	00:29:27	She was into it.	N
491	491	00:29:27	00:29:29	Dan really wasn't.	N
492	492	00:29:29	00:29:32	How did your wife feel about you and Vanessa Keaton?	N
493	493	00:29:32	00:29:35	Well, it's not like we were having an affair.	N
494	494	00:29:35	00:29:37	That'd be breaking the rules.	N
495	495	00:29:37	00:29:38	The rules?	N
496	496	00:29:38	00:29:39	No, means no.	N
497	497	00:29:39	00:29:43	Arrive as a couple, leave as a couple.	N
498	498	00:29:43	00:29:45	Drugs, never.	N
499	499	00:29:45	00:29:47	Condoms, condoms always.	N
500	500	00:29:47	00:29:48	No affairs.	N
501	501	00:29:48	00:29:52	Sex with someone other than your spouse is only allowed at the parties.	N
502	502	00:29:52	00:29:57	No photos, no video.	N
503	503	00:29:58	00:29:59	And the kids must never know.	N
504	504	00:29:59	00:30:00	I came home one night.	N
505	505	00:30:00	00:30:04	I parked the car in the driveway and went to the fridge to grab a beer.	N
506	506	00:30:04	00:30:06	It was the wrong beer.	N
507	507	00:30:06	00:30:08	I was in the wrong house.	N
508	508	00:30:08	00:30:12	Anyway, it just got all the neighbors talking.	N
509	509	00:30:13	00:30:15	Variety is a good thing.	N
510	510	00:30:15	00:30:23	And if you get the right group of people together, a couple of drinks, you'd be surprised what can happen.	N
511	511	00:30:24	00:30:29	Everybody fantasizes about other people.	N
512	512	00:30:31	00:30:34	Even you, Mr. Grissom.	N
513	513	00:30:34	00:30:37	A neighbor, a friend...	Y
514	514	00:30:40	00:30:42	girl at the office.	Y
515	515	00:30:50	00:30:53	Thank you.	Y
516	516	00:30:53	00:30:57	I know I'm supposed to be objective...	Y
517	517	00:30:57	00:31:00	but I think I have a problem with the lifestyle.	Y
518	518	00:31:00	00:31:05	Well, they're consenting adults, it's not illegal.	Y
519	519	00:31:05	00:31:10	At most, they only hurt themselves.	Y
520	520	00:31:10	00:31:12	Tell that to Vanessa Keaton.	Y
521	521	00:31:12	00:31:14	Everyone has a jealousy gene.	N
522	522	00:31:14	00:31:18	You think it was a crime of passion?	Y
523	523	00:31:18	00:31:19	Yeah.	N
524	524	00:31:19	00:31:23	When you have to go outside a marriage for passion, you're in trouble.	Y
525	525	00:31:23	00:31:25	Or your asking for trouble.	N
526	526	00:31:25	00:31:28	Well, they say they're happily married.	Y
527	527	00:31:29	00:31:31	You think they're happy?	Y
528	528	00:31:37	00:31:40	Grissom.	Y
529	529	00:31:41	00:31:43	Very good, thanks.	Y
530	530	00:31:43	00:31:48	Hodges matched the water in Vanessa Keaton's lungs.	Y
531	531	00:31:48	00:31:50	He knows where she drowned.	N
532	532	00:31:58	00:32:02	So Mr. and Mrs. Cunningham, was Vanessa Keaton here the night she died?	N
533	533	00:32:02	00:32:03	No.	N
534	534	00:32:03	00:32:07	Well, we matched the water in her lungs to your spa.	N
535	535	00:32:08	00:32:11	And I see what appears to be a blood smear on the stone.	N
536	536	00:32:11	00:32:14	Well, sometimes we forget to lock the gate.	Y
537	537	00:32:14	00:32:15	So your neighbors come in and use the spa?	N
538	538	00:32:15	00:32:16	It's possible.	N
539	539	00:32:16	00:32:19	Yeah, I guess so, I mean, you share everything else.	N
540	540	00:32:19	00:32:21	Why not?	N
541	541	00:32:21	00:32:23	So what time did you leave the party?	N
542	542	00:32:23	00:32:25	30.	N
543	543	00:32:25	00:32:26	But we didn't come right home.	Y
544	544	00:32:26	00:32:27	Where'd you go?	Y
545	545	00:32:27	00:32:29	We went to the Bellagio.	N
546	546	00:32:29	00:32:32	A nice, romantic night out, just the two of us.	N
547	547	00:32:32	00:32:36	Sometimes being with others gives you the urge to be alone.	Y
548	548	00:32:36	00:32:38	I see.	Y
549	549	00:32:38	00:32:43	Well, we're going to compel a DNA sample, so we'll know if you were intimate with Vanessa Keaton.	N
550	550	00:32:43	00:32:47	I admit I had sex with her and...	N
551	551	00:32:47	00:32:50	Karen Brady, and Mallory Stone.	N
552	552	00:32:50	00:32:52	Three strikes you're out.	N
553	553	00:32:57	00:32:59	Heard your suspect's looking pretty good.	N
554	554	00:32:59	00:33:01	You heard right.	N
555	555	00:33:01	00:33:03	Charlie confessed to killing the landlord.	N
556	556	00:33:03	00:33:06	And the blood on his watch is a match to Visingi's DNA.	N
557	557	00:33:06	00:33:07	What about her?	N
558	558	00:33:07	00:33:09	Swears he has nothing to do with it.	N
559	559	00:33:09	00:33:11	You got a C.O.D.?	N
560	560	00:33:11	00:33:13	Blunt-force trauma to the occipital region.	N
561	561	00:33:13	00:33:15	No trace in the wound track.	N
562	562	00:33:15	00:33:18	Do you have any idea what hit her? Yeah.	Y
563	563	00:33:18	00:33:20	The impact's deep.	Y
564	564	00:33:20	00:33:21	Weapon was probably heavy.	Y
565	565	00:33:24	00:33:27	Radius of curvature, roughly three centimeters.	Y
566	566	00:33:27	00:33:29	Could be a pipe.	N
567	567	00:33:29	00:33:32	Could be anything.	N
568	568	00:33:32	00:33:37	Mrs. Cunningham, you told us that you spent last night at the Bellagio with your husband.	N
569	569	00:33:37	00:33:39	That's correct.	N
570	570	00:33:39	00:33:42	Are you sure about that?	N
571	571	00:33:42	00:33:43	D-Do I need a lawyer?	N
572	572	00:33:43	00:33:51	I mean, that's your call, that's your right, but let me point out that if you're covering for your husband, that's conspiracy after the fact.	N
573	573	00:33:51	00:33:54	Now, are you prepared to go to jail over this?	N
574	574	00:33:54	00:33:57	Look, I-I answered your question.	N
575	575	00:33:57	00:34:02	Okay, what if I told you the hotel maid told us that you weren't with Tom, what would you say?	N
576	576	00:34:02	00:34:04	I'd say she was lying.	N
577	577	00:34:05	00:34:11	You know, I'm trying to help you out here, and I want to help you out, okay?	N
578	578	00:34:11	00:34:13	But you got to cut the crap.	N
579	579	00:34:13	00:34:15	Okay?	N
580	580	00:34:15	00:34:17	Come on, tell me what happened.	N
581	581	00:34:18	00:34:21	I mean, security confirmed that you were with a female.	N
582	582	00:34:21	00:34:27	Late 20s, blonde, I mean, she even paid for breakfast with her credit card.	N
583	583	00:34:27	00:34:32	So... I'll tell you what, why don't we start over, okay?	N
584	584	00:34:32	00:34:34	And you tell me what happened.	N
585	585	00:34:38	00:34:43	Look, Tom asked me to think about our son.	N
586	586	00:34:43	00:34:46	He begged me to say we were together.	N
587	587	00:34:49	00:34:51	I swear, I don't know...	N
588	588	00:34:51	00:34:53	anything that went on between him and Vanessa.	Y
589	589	00:34:53	00:34:56	I don't know.	Y
590	590	00:35:48	00:35:50	Found some porn.	N
591	591	00:35:57	00:35:59	Well, nothing new about this stuff.	Y
592	592	00:35:59	00:36:01	The frescos at Pompeii were more explicit.	Y
593	593	00:36:01	00:36:04	The Kama Sutra and Decameron.	Y
594	594	00:36:04	00:36:08	Yeah, but that's art; this... is not art.	Y
595	595	00:36:09	00:36:11	Hmm.	Y
596	596	00:36:14	00:36:15	Here we go.	N
597	597	00:36:15	00:36:18	Webcam photo.	Y
598	598	00:36:18	00:36:22	And she's wearing La Perla.	Y
599	599	00:36:22	00:36:24	Vanessa Keaton.	Y
600	600	00:36:24	00:36:31	The first victim was killed with a weapon of opportunity, the table saw.	Y
601	601	00:36:31	00:36:34	The second victim gets a crack on the head.	N
602	602	00:36:34	00:36:37	So you're thinking the weapon is still in here?	N
603	603	00:36:37	00:36:39	Yeah.	N
604	604	00:36:39	00:36:42	Why would the killer leave it in here?	N
605	605	00:36:42	00:36:44	Well, the killer left the body here.	N
606	606	00:36:44	00:36:46	That's true.	N
607	607	00:36:46	00:36:50	Mr. Pincher had a cash-only business.	N
608	608	00:36:50	00:36:54	Yeah. And he didn't have a gun license.	N
609	609	00:37:05	00:37:09	You got something? Yes.	N
610	610	00:37:18	00:37:20	A little store security.	N
611	611	00:37:22	00:37:25	Liars, liars, all men are liars!	N
612	612	00:37:29	00:37:34	It seems that the missus caught her husband collecting rent from the late Melissa Pooley.	N
613	613	00:37:34	00:37:36	She just waited till he left the building.	N
614	614	00:37:36	00:37:39	You slut! I don't care what he told you, you still have to pay rent.	N
615	615	00:37:39	00:37:40	Go to hell!	N
616	616	00:37:48	00:37:50	Luckily, she left her prints behind.	N
617	617	00:37:50	00:37:52	We had them on file from an assault case in '98.	N
618	618	00:37:52	00:37:54	Yeah, she went a little further this time.	N
619	619	00:37:54	00:37:58	Yeah, from what I hear, she did a lousy job cleaning that bat.	N
620	620	00:37:58	00:37:59	Amateur.	N
621	621	00:37:59	00:38:04	You know, you guys, you could have waited till after she paid me to arrest her.	N
622	622	00:38:04	00:38:06	What did I ever do to you?	N
623	623	00:38:06	00:38:13	Oh, except crack your case wide open. Don't worry, man, Grissom talked to the sheriff, said he's gonna pick up your tab.	Y
624	624	00:38:13	00:38:14	Really?	N
625	625	00:38:14	00:38:16	Mm-hmm. ( chuckles )	N
626	626	00:38:16	00:38:19	Thanks.	N
627	627	00:38:19	00:38:24	Hey, you think this could mean a nice, fat city contract for me?	N
628	628	00:38:24	00:38:27	Good to see you, Marty.	N
629	629	00:38:27	00:38:29	See you around, Marty.	N
630	630	00:38:30	00:38:32	Call me.	N
631	631	00:38:48	00:38:51	Innie, outie.	Y
632	632	00:38:55	00:38:58	And Vanessa doesn't have any moles on her torso.	N
633	633	00:38:58	00:39:00	The woman in the photo is not Vanessa.	N
634	634	00:39:01	00:39:02	Oh, you got my message.	N
635	635	00:39:02	00:39:03	What message?	N
636	636	00:39:04	00:39:04	To meet me here.	N
637	637	00:39:05	00:39:09	I was preparing a body for a mortuary pickup, and I noticed something.	Y
638	638	00:39:11	00:39:13	Postmortem bruising.	N
639	639	00:39:13	00:39:19	Well, it can take a day or two after autopsy for the bruises to percolate through the soft tissue and become visible.	N
640	640	00:39:19	00:39:21	Vanessa wasn't stabbed four times with a skewer.	N
641	641	00:39:21	00:39:24	She was stabbed twice with a two-pronged instrument.	Y
642	642	00:40:14	00:40:17	I just started combing through Tom Cunningham's computer.	Y
643	643	00:40:17	00:40:25	I haven't I.D.'d our mystery woman, but there's just lots of back and forth between Cunningham's e-mail account and Keaton's.	Y
644	644	00:40:25	00:40:27	Any attachments?	Y
645	645	00:40:27	00:40:28	Yeah.	Y

652	652	00:40:49	00:40:51	Can you handle it?	N
653	653	00:40:51	00:40:53	Midnight. Behind the skate park.	N
654	654	00:41:14	00:41:15	You can stop the tape.	Y
655	655	00:41:18	00:41:21	Amy came on to me.	Y
656	656	00:41:21	00:41:23	She's 15.	Y
657	657	00:41:23	00:41:26	Does she look 15 to you? Tom, be very quiet.	Y
658	658	00:41:26	00:41:29	They got me on tape. I'm trying to explain.	Y
659	659	00:41:29	00:41:32	She's a minor, you're an adult. What's to explain?	N
660	660	00:41:32	00:41:35	We have information pertaining to Vanessa Keaton's death.	Y
661	661	00:41:35	00:41:36	Get me the D.A. We want a deal.	N
662	662	00:41:39	00:41:41	Too late.	N
663	663	00:41:41	00:41:43	You are an inny.	N
664	664	00:41:43	00:41:49	Amy, you e-mailed this photo of yourself to Tom Cunningham.	N
665	665	00:41:49	00:41:51	What's she talking about?	N
666	666	00:41:51	00:41:53	I have no idea.	N
667	667	00:41:53	00:41:54	You were having an affair with Tom Cunningham.	N
668	668	00:41:55	00:41:57	He's just been booked on statutory rape.	N
669	669	00:41:57	00:41:59	What?! It wasn't rape.	N
670	670	00:41:59	00:42:01	I'm gonna to kill that son of a bitch!	N

672	672	00:42:02	00:42:06	I know about your parties, all the kids know, so don't get all righteous on me.	N
673	673	00:42:06	00:42:07	I want to see Tom. Let's go.	N
674	674	00:42:07	00:42:08	Mr. Keaton, sit down, please.	N
675	675	00:42:09	00:42:10	We're not done yet.	N
676	676	00:42:16	00:42:20	We retrieved this from the Cunningham's backyard.	N
677	677	00:42:20	00:42:25	Your stepmother's blood is on the tines, and your fingerprints are on them.	N
678	678	00:42:35	00:42:39	Easy, easy.	N
679	679	00:42:39	00:42:43	The stab wounds weren't fatal, but your stepmother was knocked unconscious.	N
680	680	00:42:44	00:42:46	It took two or three minutes for her to drown.	N
681	681	00:42:46	00:42:49	That's a long time to stand around and watch someone die.	N
682	682	00:42:49	00:42:51	It wasn't like that.	N
683	683	00:42:52	00:42:55	How could you! Calm down!	N
684	684	00:42:55	00:43:00	You need to go home, right now. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.	N
685	685	00:43:00	00:43:03	He was trying to protect me.	N
686	686	00:43:04	00:43:06	So we put her in the fountain.	N
687	687	00:43:10	00:43:12	He loves me.	N
688	688	00:43:15	00:43:17	Can I see him?	N
