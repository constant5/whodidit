0	00:00:09	00:00:11	There's a promise made in the Book of Daniel.
1	00:00:11	00:00:20	Those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt.
2	00:00:20	00:00:23	When you are woken, among whom will you be counted?
3	00:00:23	00:00:37	Before you lie down in darkness, what deeds will you do in the light, so that you might rest in serenity, in confidence, without malice or owed vengeance?
4	00:00:37	00:00:40	Take heed, take heed, children, while you're still among the living.
5	00:00:40	00:00:42	If one night, the dead shall awake...
6	00:00:42	00:00:44	shall awake, shall awake...
7	00:00:44	00:00:47	How, how, how will they look upon you?
8	00:01:07	00:01:08	Well, that's beautiful.
9	00:01:08	00:01:10	Don't let the wings fool you.
10	00:01:10	00:01:13	Hanging around in this neighborhood, she's no angel.
11	00:01:13	00:01:16	Yeah, I heard it was pretty tough around here-- gangs, lots of drugs.
12	00:01:16	00:01:18	Three square miles of felony.
13	00:01:18	00:01:20	Even the graveyard sees its share.
14	00:01:20	00:01:26	So a widow comes to visit her beloved over there, stumbles over the more recently departed.
15	00:01:26	00:01:28	Hey, David.
16	00:01:28	00:01:30	Died around midnight.
17	00:01:30	00:01:34	And he has a single GSW to the head.
18	00:01:34	00:01:35	Holy man.
19	00:01:35	00:01:37	Ah, this is the Reverend Rick Renken.
20	00:01:37	00:01:40	He preaches at a church down the street.
21	00:01:40	00:01:41	So, what do you think?
22	00:01:41	00:01:47	Kneeling, paying his respects, maybe even, uh, brings that plant there as an offering?
23	00:01:47	00:01:48	No, that's from me.
24	00:01:48	00:01:50	I put it there last week.
25	00:01:57	00:02:00	It's Warrick.
26	00:02:00	00:02:02	He used to be a CSI.
27	00:02:02	00:02:04	So you think he was a friend of the reverend's?
28	00:02:04	00:02:06	Maybe.
29	00:02:06	00:02:07	He grew up a couple of blocks from here.
30	00:02:07	00:02:09	I mean, he knew everybody in the neighborhood.
31	00:02:09	00:02:11	Ah, it's a shame he's not here to help us out.
32	00:02:11	00:02:13	Let him rest in peace.
33	00:02:13	00:02:15	We'll find the guy who did this.
34	00:02:53	00:02:55	Nine millimeter.
35	00:02:55	00:02:57	But it's been here awhile-- it's all corroded.
36	00:02:57	00:03:00	Found this .38-- just as rusty.
37	00:03:00	00:03:02	They're obviously not from this particular shooting.
38	00:03:02	00:03:04	Nope.
39	00:03:04	00:03:06	So what do you think?
40	00:03:06	00:03:10	All the guns in this neighborhood, maybe the reverend just caught a stray.
41	00:03:10	00:03:17	Well, it's possible-- there was no stippling or sooting around the GSW, so he was shot from at least a few feet away.
42	00:03:17	00:03:22	So, he's kneeling, he gets shot from behind and the right, which means...
43	00:03:22	00:03:24	I'll check it out.
44	00:03:24	00:03:25	So...
45	00:03:25	00:03:27	chapter and verse on the Reverend Rick.
46	00:03:27	00:03:29	He was single, lived alone.
47	00:03:29	00:03:32	A co-worker said he finished his sermon 00 p.m. last night.
48	00:03:32	00:03:37	So, maybe he took a shortcut, stopped to spend some time with Warrick.
49	00:03:37	00:03:38	Shortcut to the Holy Land.
50	00:03:46	00:03:49	Hey, Nicky. Nicky, hold up.
51	00:03:49	00:03:51	You okay?
52	00:03:51	00:03:55	It's all hitting a little close to home for me, you know?
53	00:03:55	00:03:59	Yeah, I don't know, to be honest, I haven't been back here since the funeral.
54	00:03:59	00:04:00	Four and half years like that.
55	00:04:00	00:04:02	Yeah, I know.
56	00:04:02	00:04:03	You know, but I miss him, though.
57	00:04:03	00:04:05	I think about him, you know?
58	00:04:05	00:04:07	Especially on fight weekends when the Strip is all electric.
59	00:04:07	00:04:09	I mean, there's no way that he's missing this action.
60	00:04:09	00:04:12	Yeah, you're right about that.
61	00:04:12	00:04:14	So what would Warrick's move be?
62	00:04:14	00:04:17	Do you know who Aaron Voss is?
63	00:04:17	00:04:18	Ghetto Gotti?
64	00:04:18	00:04:20	Drugs, fear, extortion-- that's his game.
65	00:04:20	00:04:23	Nothing goes down in this neighborhood without being a blip on his radar.
66	00:04:23	00:04:25	That's true.
67	00:04:25	00:04:27	Let's go hit him up.
68	00:04:27	00:04:31	Man usually charges for dishing out his...hard-earned wisdom.
69	00:04:31	00:04:34	Now, you got plenty of revenue streams in that neighborhood.
70	00:04:34	00:04:36	It's time for a little charity, a little give-back, huh?
71	00:04:36	00:04:38	What do you know about the reverend's shooting?
72	00:04:38	00:04:39	Out of the loop on that one.
73	00:04:39	00:04:43	A week ago, you almost took a bullet not 50 yards from that graveyard.
74	00:04:43	00:04:47	So maybe the same bad shooter came back, put a round in the rev, but...
75	00:04:47	00:04:49	maybe it was mistaken identity.
76	00:04:49	00:04:52	Shooter'll have to be blind to mistake me for a holy man.
77	00:04:52	00:04:53	No one's mistaking you for a good guy.
78	00:04:53	00:05:00	But the stuff you've been getting away with in that neighborhood, it's gonna catch up to you soon enough.
79	00:05:00	00:05:04	This is about Warrick Brown, isn't it, why you're so interested?
80	00:05:04	00:05:07	Little blood on your buddy's grave got you riled up.
81	00:05:08	00:05:11	You know, Warrick and I went way back.
82	00:05:11	00:05:12	He despised you.
83	00:05:12	00:05:17	He said that you were everything that was wrong with that neighborhood, everything that he wanted to change.
84	00:05:17	00:05:19	And what did he change?
85	00:05:19	00:05:28	You know, guys like Warrick and the reverend, they talk a good game, but who's actually keeping things together in the hood?
86	00:05:28	00:05:30	That's me.
87	00:05:33	00:05:35	I'm losing money.
88	00:05:35	00:05:37	You're free to go--I'm not charging you with anything.
89	00:05:40	00:05:43	Say a prayer to St. Warrick for me.
90	00:06:05	00:06:06	Shh!
91	00:06:06	00:06:08	Mommy's sleeping.
92	00:06:08	00:06:10	She doesn't like to get woke up.
93	00:06:10	00:06:11	Eli?
94	00:06:11	00:06:13	Yeah?
95	00:06:15	00:06:17	I'm Nick.
96	00:06:17	00:06:18	Stokes.
97	00:06:18	00:06:21	I worked with, uh...
98	00:06:21	00:06:24	Well, your dad, he was one of my best friends.
99	00:06:24	00:06:26	My daddy had friends?
100	00:06:26	00:06:29	Oh, yeah, lots of them.
101	00:06:29	00:06:33	Man, you're getting big-- I haven't seen you Eli!
102	00:06:33	00:06:34	Come play inside, baby.
103	00:06:37	00:06:39	Tina.
104	00:06:39	00:06:40	What are you doing here, Nick?
105	00:06:40	00:06:46	I don't know if you heard or not, but there was a body found on Warrick's grave.
106	00:06:46	00:06:48	I told you back then, I didn't want you here.
107	00:06:48	00:06:54	Ever. If you ever come near my son, I will call the police.
108	00:07:58	00:08:01	White powder you found on the man of the cloth's cloth?
109	00:08:01	00:08:02	Our good old friend Oxy.
110	00:08:02	00:08:04	Prescription pain killer.
111	00:08:04	00:08:07	The only reason to crush it into a powder is to use it recreationally.
112	00:08:07	00:08:09	Holy Man might have had a habit.
113	00:08:09	00:08:11	Well, Tox had him clean and sober.
114	00:08:11	00:08:18	So the fact that it's on the seat of his pants-- could've sat in it while counseling some troubled member of his flock?
115	00:08:18	00:08:21	Hazards of an enlightened man working among degenerates.
116	00:08:21	00:08:23	Been there.
117	00:08:23	00:08:26	Well, why don't you enlighten me on the trace from the shoe soles?
118	00:08:26	00:08:29	Indigo dye and calcium carbonate.
119	00:08:29	00:08:32	Blue chalk...hmm.
120	00:08:32	00:08:33	Guys.
121	00:08:33	00:08:34	Where'd you find that?
122	00:08:34	00:08:36	Uh, soles of the reverend's shoes.
123	00:08:36	00:08:38	Yeah, I think I know what this is.
124	00:08:38	00:08:40	I stopped by Tina's house today.
125	00:08:40	00:08:42	Eli had covered the stoop with a big blue sky.
126	00:08:42	00:08:44	Reverend must have been there.
127	00:08:44	00:08:46	Difficult to avoid stepping through the chalk.
128	00:08:46	00:08:51	Well, wherever he picked up the chalk is probably the same place he picked up the crushed drugs.
129	00:08:51	00:08:53	Oxycodone.
130	00:08:53	00:08:55	The last place he was alive may have been Tina's house.
131	00:08:55	00:08:59	I said I don't know anything about this.
132	00:08:59	00:09:00	Back off.
133	00:09:00	00:09:05	Well, the officer can explain everything outside, Tina, but we have to come in.
134	00:09:05	00:09:10	Remember Warrick's funeral, when you and Nick Stokes were crying over him, fawning over Eli.
135	00:09:10	00:09:15	And then you walked right past me, you didn't say a single word.
136	00:09:15	00:09:16	That was a tough time.
137	00:09:16	00:09:20	Ms. Brewster, we really need you to step outside with the officer.
138	00:09:20	00:09:22	You know, it's not gonna happen.
139	00:09:22	00:09:24	Mom, I want to play outside.
140	00:09:24	00:09:25	(groans) Eli...
141	00:09:40	00:09:42	This would have made Warrick sick.
142	00:09:42	00:09:44	Yeah, what a mess.
143	00:09:44	00:09:46	Warrick's grandmother raised him in this house.
144	00:09:46	00:09:49	He bought the property.
145	00:09:49	00:09:53	Let Tina live in it after they split up two years into their marriage.
146	00:09:53	00:09:56	Warrick was okay with his kid living in this part of town?
147	00:09:56	00:10:02	You know, I don't know-- he was trying to get custody of Eli when he was murdered.
148	00:10:03	00:10:05	I remember when he bought this thing.
149	00:10:05	00:10:07	It cost him two weeks' salary.
150	00:10:07	00:10:09	I thought he was nuts.
151	00:10:09	00:10:11	He was so proud of this.
152	00:10:19	00:10:21	Where did Warrick meet this woman?
153	00:10:21	00:10:23	She was different then.
154	00:10:23	00:10:24	She was a nurse.
155	00:10:24	00:10:26	Really?
156	00:10:26	00:10:28	Quit when she got his death benefits?
157	00:10:28	00:10:30	That's the rumor.
158	00:10:30	00:10:35	Before I went away, I'd stop by, brought some food.
159	00:10:35	00:10:36	House was always dark.
160	00:10:38	00:10:41	Eli would be crying.
161	00:10:41	00:10:42	She never answered the door.
162	00:10:48	00:10:50	Well, these aren't her jeans.
163	00:10:50	00:10:52	She's got a man in her life.
164	00:10:52	00:10:54	I've got some trace-- could be...
165	00:10:54	00:10:57	oxycodone within reach of a child.
166	00:11:00	00:11:02	That's not good.
167	00:11:02	00:11:06	No name on the pill bottle, but there is a print.
168	00:11:22	00:11:25	A little boy should not be living here.
169	00:11:25	00:11:26	Yeah.
170	00:11:29	00:11:31	Lab got a hit on the print on the pill bottle.
171	00:11:31	00:11:33	It's a local.
172	00:11:33	00:11:34	His name is Cliff Paul.
173	00:11:36	00:11:38	Ag-assault, domestic battery.
174	00:11:38	00:11:40	He's still on parole.
175	00:11:40	00:11:43	She's trying to keep you guys out of her house.
176	00:11:45	00:11:47	CSIs just show up at my house.
177	00:11:47	00:11:50	Ms. Brewster-- Tina-- we know that the reverend was here last night.
178	00:11:50	00:11:52	So what happened?
179	00:11:52	00:11:54	I don't have to explain myself to you.
180	00:11:54	00:11:56	Then how about explaining Cliff Paul?
181	00:11:56	00:11:58	Okay, we know he was here, too.
182	00:11:58	00:12:00	We found his oxy and his weed.
183	00:12:00	00:12:04	Detectives are picking him up right now, so maybe you'd like tell your side of the story first.
184	00:12:05	00:12:07	No? Okay.
185	00:12:07	00:12:09	So maybe Cliff is the reason that the reverend stopped by.
186	00:12:09	00:12:12	Maybe he wanted to talk to you about having a felon in your house?
187	00:12:12	00:12:15	You think I haven't heard what you all did, huh?
188	00:12:15	00:12:17	Excuse me? McKeen...
189	00:12:17	00:12:19	the man you let murder my husband?
190	00:12:19	00:12:22	How you CSIs let him kill other people.
191	00:12:22	00:12:28	You stand here trashing my life-- Ms. Brewster--Ms. Brewster, this woman here is from Child Protective Services.
192	00:12:28	00:12:29	She's gonna have to take Eli.
193	00:12:29	00:12:31	What? Your home is not fit for a child.
194	00:12:31	00:12:34	Oh, wait, no! Eli! Eli!
195	00:12:34	00:12:35	Come with me, Eli.
196	00:12:35	00:12:37	Ma'am... ma'am! No, no!
197	00:12:37	00:12:38	No!
198	00:12:39	00:12:42	Mommy!
199	00:12:46	00:12:48	Ma'am! Come here! No! No! No!
200	00:12:48	00:12:50	Just stay back! Mom!
201	00:12:50	00:12:51	Baby! Hold on!
202	00:12:51	00:12:52	Mommy! No!
203	00:12:52	00:12:54	Mommy! Eli!
204	00:12:57	00:12:58	Mommy!
205	00:13:11	00:13:13	Cliff Paul, Las Vegas Police.
206	00:13:19	00:13:20	All clear.
207	00:13:38	00:13:39	Found him.
208	00:13:48	00:13:50	David still down there with the body?
209	00:13:50	00:13:59	Yeah. Liver temp 00 a.m., which is a couple of hours after the reverend was murdered.
210	00:13:59	00:14:05	Reminds me of those dance instruction floor mats, you know-- learn to tango.
211	00:14:05	00:14:06	Can I lead? Please do.
212	00:14:06	00:14:08	All the treads match Cliff Paul's shoes.
213	00:14:08	00:14:14	So he's getting his drink on, goes to answer the door, opens it, and he stumbles back and drops the bottle.
214	00:14:14	00:14:16	Steps back through the beer.
215	00:14:18	00:14:20	And then a dash to the window.
216	00:14:20	00:14:22	Goes right through.
217	00:14:22	00:14:25	Two-story drop, he might have thought that he could make it.
218	00:14:25	00:14:26	Escape.
219	00:14:26	00:14:30	But why would he choose flight when he was armed to fight?
220	00:14:31	00:14:33	Found it stuffed between the couch cushions.
221	00:14:33	00:14:35	It's a .45 auto.
222	00:14:35	00:14:36	That's interesting.
223	00:14:36	00:14:40	Doc said the round he pulled from the reverend was a .45.
224	00:14:40	00:14:43	Both of Tina's visitors dead in one night?
225	00:14:43	00:14:46	Could be the piece that connects them.
226	00:14:46	00:14:48	Reverend shows up to Tina's house, right?
227	00:14:48	00:14:53	Cliff's already there, probably not all that thrilled that the preacher butts in.
228	00:14:53	00:14:57	Reverend leaves, goes to the cemetery, maybe for guidance from Warrick?
229	00:14:57	00:15:05	Cliff follows the reverend to the cemetery, shoots him, comes back here, tucks the gun into the sofa.
230	00:15:05	00:15:12	Somebody shows up at the door, somehow drives him out through the window.
231	00:15:12	00:15:13	It's kind of spooky, don't you think?
232	00:15:13	00:15:14	What?
233	00:15:14	00:15:24	Kill a holy man in a cemetery, something follows you back home, something that doesn't leave any shoe prints and it scares you so thoroughly that you jump out the window?
234	00:15:24	00:15:26	Eh... I'm just saying.
235	00:15:26	00:15:31	I don't think it takes supernatural ability to avoid stepping in beer.
236	00:15:33	00:15:35	Did you lose a flashlight?
237	00:15:35	00:15:38	Sorry?
238	00:15:38	00:15:40	Looks like one of ours.
239	00:15:40	00:15:43	Definitely not been used in the appropriate manner.
240	00:15:43	00:15:45	The blood is black; it's not tacky.
241	00:15:45	00:15:47	It's older than last night.
242	00:15:50	00:15:53	Gravitational drops just as old.
243	00:15:53	00:15:57	Maybe there was a round one before last night's fatal round two.
244	00:16:18	00:16:21	DNA pegs the flashlight blood as Cliff Paul's.
245	00:16:21	00:16:26	The blood on the apartment floor is from a different, unknown contributor.
246	00:16:26	00:16:30	Well, whoever hit Cliff with that must have gotten a blow in return.
247	00:16:31	00:16:33	And there it is.
248	00:16:33	00:16:36	Printing the battery-- bright idea.
249	00:16:41	00:16:43	Let's see who clocked Cliff.
250	00:16:56	00:16:58	Warrick.
251	00:17:11	00:17:17	Victim appears to have suffered a fatal cervical spinal fracture between the C3 and C4.
252	00:17:17	00:17:21	No trauma on his back to indicate he was pushed or kicked through the window.
253	00:17:21	00:17:27	When David washed the blood from his face, he noticed a peripheral wound on the forehead, a few days old, judging by the scab.
254	00:17:27	00:17:37	Blunt, round-edged instrument. You know something, that could've come from the bloody flashlight we found at the scene, which belonged, by the way, to your friend Warrick Brown.
255	00:17:37	00:17:38	You're kidding.
256	00:17:38	00:17:42	Our, uh, victim here was spending time with Warrick's widow.
257	00:17:42	00:17:48	She probably kept Warrick's flashlight, got into a fight with this guy, maybe pulled it out of her purse and whacked him with it.
258	00:17:48	00:17:54	He hardly seems a worthy successor to my friend Warrick, in Tina's life or anywhere else.
259	00:17:54	00:17:56	You know, this is a little bit weird.
260	00:17:56	00:18:04	We've been assuming that Cliff here killed the reverend, but if he did, then why'd the reverend write him a check for a thousand bucks?
261	00:18:06	00:18:07	What do you have?
262	00:18:07	00:18:10	Internet history from Cliff Paul's computer.
263	00:18:10	00:18:13	I'm trying to establish a timeline on him.
264	00:18:13	00:18:15	You know, Cliff didn't really strike me as the computer type.
265	00:18:15	00:18:18	No, just the lots and lots of free porn type.
266	00:18:18	00:18:23	Oh. Hidden cameras, hot school girls, daddy/daughter.
267	00:18:23	00:18:24	Filthy.
268	00:18:24	00:18:26	Ironically, it cleanses him.
269	00:18:26	00:18:33	He was active online 00 p.m. until 1 Home at the time of the reverend's death.
270	00:18:33	00:18:36	Yeah, but the murder weapon was found at Cliff's place.
271	00:18:36	00:18:41	Ballistics confirmed it, so whoever killed the reverend had to have gone to Cliff's afterwards.
272	00:18:41	00:18:45	Used the gun to drive Cliff out the window and then planted it.
273	00:18:45	00:18:49	But why would somebody go after the reverend and Cliff on the very same night?
274	00:18:49	00:18:50	A minister and a sinner.
275	00:18:50	00:18:53	And there might be more of a connection than we thought.
276	00:18:53	00:18:55	Russell's going through both of the men's finances.
277	00:18:55	00:19:01	So far, the reverend's bank accounts are suspiciously fruitful and multiplying.
278	00:19:12	00:19:15	That's pretty cool, huh?
279	00:19:15	00:19:17	I like chalk better.
280	00:19:17	00:19:19	Yeah, hey, Eli.
281	00:19:19	00:19:23	I want to ask you about somebody.
282	00:19:23	00:19:25	Do you know this man, Cliff?
283	00:19:25	00:19:27	He comes over to your house sometimes.
284	00:19:27	00:19:29	All the time.
285	00:19:29	00:19:30	I don't like him.
286	00:19:30	00:19:33	No? Why's that?
287	00:19:33	00:19:36	He yells; he's scary.
288	00:19:36	00:19:39	He makes my mom get sad.
289	00:19:39	00:19:41	That's when I hide under my bed.
290	00:19:44	00:19:45	Right this way, Miss Brewster.
291	00:19:50	00:19:53	Let me show you something else this can do here.
292	00:19:58	00:20:00	Chalk can't do that, huh?
293	00:20:03	00:20:08	Last night, Mom promised me he won't come over anymore.
294	00:20:10	00:20:11	Okay.
295	00:20:16	00:20:17	Boy, you look just like your daddy.
296	00:20:17	00:20:19	You know that?
297	00:20:19	00:20:20	My daddy was handsome, huh?
298	00:20:20	00:20:23	Yeah, he was.
299	00:20:23	00:20:25	He sure was.
300	00:20:25	00:20:30	See, the problem here in Vegas is, spare cash is quicker to the crap table than the collection plate.
301	00:20:30	00:20:33	So the reverend needed an angle.
302	00:20:33	00:20:36	Ripping off real estate probably seemed like a good idea to him.
303	00:20:36	00:20:43	Yeah, we checked his finances, discovered the scam he pulled, getting you to sign your house over to the church.
304	00:20:43	00:20:44	You're not the only one he did this to.
305	00:20:44	00:20:46	How'd he get you to sign?
306	00:20:46	00:20:49	He get Cliff Paul to make you sign on the dotted line?
307	00:20:49	00:20:54	Because as soon as the deal was done, that day, the revered broke off Cliff Paul a grand.
308	00:20:54	00:20:56	That house is mine.
309	00:20:56	00:20:58	Except you gave it away, Tina.
310	00:20:58	00:20:59	The bank told us you called them last week.
311	00:20:59	00:21:01	You were cussing them out.
312	00:21:01	00:21:04	You were trying to get them to change the deed back, but the deed was already done.
313	00:21:04	00:21:06	That's why Reverend Rick came over last night.
314	00:21:06	00:21:11	I told him that I was gonna let everybody in the church know what he'd done.
315	00:21:11	00:21:14	And he said that everything was gonna be okay for me.
316	00:21:14	00:21:19	Well, an hour later, someone made everything not okay for him.
317	00:21:19	00:21:23	We know that you had a violent fight with Cliff Paul, and you drew some blood.
318	00:21:26	00:21:27	They kicked down my door.
319	00:21:28	00:21:31	Tina... You steal my son, and now you're accusing me of murder?
320	00:21:31	00:21:33	We're just trying to figure this out, okay?
321	00:21:33	00:21:36	Well, let's start with-- I've never seen this flashlight.
322	00:21:36	00:21:37	It was in Warrick's CSI kit.
323	00:21:37	00:21:39	It would've been in your possession.
324	00:21:39	00:21:44	After the job killed him, I gave all of Warrick's CSI junk away.
325	00:21:44	00:21:46	Well, who'd you give it to?
326	00:21:46	00:21:49	Some kid from the neighborhood that Warrick would help out.
327	00:21:49	00:21:51	Well, is he still in the neighborhood?
328	00:21:51	00:21:52	Yeah.
329	00:21:52	00:21:54	Where can we find him?
330	00:22:14	00:22:15	LVPD.
331	00:22:18	00:22:20	Take your hood off so I can see you.
332	00:22:23	00:22:25	I thought you released this crime scene.
333	00:22:25	00:22:27	We did.
334	00:22:28	00:22:31	Are you James Newman?
335	00:22:31	00:22:34	I heard you were a friend of Warrick Brown's.
336	00:22:34	00:22:36	Did he teach you about crime scenes?
337	00:22:36	00:22:38	Warrick taught me everything.
338	00:22:38	00:22:39	Looked out for me.
339	00:22:42	00:22:45	I saw you near Tina's place earlier.
340	00:22:45	00:22:48	She says she sees you there a lot.
341	00:22:48	00:22:50	What are you doing over there?
342	00:22:50	00:22:52	They need someone to look out for them.
343	00:22:52	00:22:56	What do you know about Reverend Rick and Cliff Paul?
344	00:22:56	00:22:58	Warrick would've wanted them gone.
345	00:23:04	00:23:07	You need to send an officer out here!
346	00:23:07	00:23:08	Tina Brewster's house!
347	00:23:08	00:23:10	There's a guy in there with her and her son--Cliff Paul!
348	00:23:10	00:23:13	And I can hear him yelling! Hurry!
349	00:23:13	00:23:15	We pulled the LVPD's phone logs.
350	00:23:15	00:23:20	You made four calls last week, but the police never did respond?
351	00:23:20	00:23:22	So you took drastic action on your own.
352	00:23:22	00:23:24	You went to Cliff's house and duked it out with him.
353	00:23:24	00:23:28	And we found blood, your DNA, on his floor.
354	00:23:28	00:23:29	That was three days ago.
355	00:23:31	00:23:33	Stay away from Tina and Eli.
356	00:23:33	00:23:35	And if I don't, big man?
357	00:23:40	00:23:42	He hit me. I defended myself.
358	00:23:42	00:23:43	That was all I did.
359	00:23:49	00:23:52	My nephew is not a criminal.
360	00:23:52	00:23:54	How long has James lived with you?
361	00:23:54	00:23:57	Since my sister died, seven years ago.
362	00:23:57	00:23:59	Single mother, he didn't have anyone else.
363	00:23:59	00:24:00	Have you ever known him to be violent?
364	00:24:00	00:24:02	Never!
365	00:24:02	00:24:04	And the reverend?
366	00:24:04	00:24:08	James volunteers at the church; he works closely with Reverend Rick.
367	00:24:08	00:24:11	Why would anyone think he would want to hurt a good man like that?
368	00:24:11	00:24:17	The reverend may have had some indiscretions that James was privy to.
369	00:24:21	00:24:27	Ms. Newman, is there something that you...?
370	00:24:27	00:24:28	James's mother...
371	00:24:30	00:24:32	Her mind wasn't right.
372	00:24:32	00:24:35	Vivid imagination, we called it at first.
373	00:24:35	00:24:39	Only, the things she was seeing and hearing, it wasn't imaginary to her.
374	00:24:40	00:24:43	Then it was too much.
375	00:24:43	00:24:45	She killed herself.
376	00:24:47	00:24:52	James has always been a great kid.
377	00:24:52	00:24:56	Straight A's. Kind.
378	00:24:56	00:24:57	Same way his mother was.
379	00:24:59	00:25:00	Until...
380	00:25:00	00:25:02	Until she changed.
381	00:25:05	00:25:09	Your aunt let us into your room, where we found some of your notes here.
382	00:25:09	00:25:14	.22 caliber smaller gun, $100, .45 caliber, $150.
383	00:25:14	00:25:19	Guy on the corner of Washington and D has other pieces.
384	00:25:19	00:25:20	And you went with a .45.
385	00:25:20	00:25:22	I didn't buy a gun.
386	00:25:22	00:25:25	I wanted one just to scare these guys away from Tina and Eli.
387	00:25:25	00:25:28	The guy on the corner, he wouldn't even sell it to me.
388	00:25:28	00:25:30	The guy on the corner, what's he, a gun-control advocate?
389	00:25:30	00:25:33	'Cause you bought a gun, shot the reverend, then you went to Cliff's.
390	00:25:33	00:25:36	I wanted them dead!
391	00:25:36	00:25:38	Warrick would've wanted them dead.
392	00:25:38	00:25:41	The way those two treated his family?
393	00:25:41	00:25:42	I kept thinking about it.
394	00:25:42	00:25:44	But I didn't do it!
395	00:25:44	00:25:50	So, what, you just wished it out there in the universe, and behold, two people end up dead?
396	00:25:50	00:25:51	Yes.
397	00:25:53	00:25:55	It's happened to me before.
398	00:25:55	00:25:59	And what do you mean by that? Ben Drayton.
399	00:25:59	00:26:02	Guy down my street, year older than me.
400	00:26:02	00:26:05	Used to knock me around, take my stuff.
401	00:26:05	00:26:09	One day, around a year ago, maybe, I had these new sneakers.
402	00:26:09	00:26:11	After school, Ben Drayton jumped me.
403	00:26:11	00:26:14	and ripped them right off my feet.
404	00:26:14	00:26:16	I walked home in my socks.
405	00:26:16	00:26:21	The next morning, I opened my front door and my sneakers were right there.
406	00:26:22	00:26:26	Nobody I know has ever seen Ben Drayton again.
407	00:26:26	00:26:29	Warrick always said he'd look out for me.
408	00:26:29	00:26:33	And even though he's gone, I still think he's somehow watching over me and his family.
409	00:26:36	00:26:40	They were up on a shelf in James's room, sitting there like trophies.
410	00:26:40	00:26:46	Well, I guess if your mystical guardian angel returns them, you're not just gonna wear them around, right?
411	00:26:46	00:26:47	Check this out.
412	00:26:47	00:26:51	Bully Ben was reported missing by his family a year ago.
413	00:26:51	00:26:53	That's consistent with James's story.
414	00:26:53	00:26:56	He's working a night shift at a burger joint, never came home.
415	00:26:56	00:26:59	18 years old, behavior issues, cops just figured it was a runaway.
416	00:26:59	00:27:01	Well, I don't think it was that simple.
417	00:27:01	00:27:03	Look at this.
418	00:27:05	00:27:07	Blood spatter. High-velocity.
419	00:27:07	00:27:10	Not talking a nosebleed or a fistfight.
420	00:27:10	00:27:11	Gunshot.
421	00:27:11	00:27:16	Okay, there is a DNA sample of Ben Drayton's in the missing persons database.
422	00:27:16	00:27:18	Let's get a comparison.
423	00:28:03	00:28:06	Surveillance footage from Ben Drayton's final shift at the burger joint.
424	00:28:06	00:28:08	He's the last guy there, so he's closing up.
425	00:28:08	00:28:10	Look at that.
426	00:28:10	00:28:12	He's wearing the shoes he took from James.
427	00:28:12	00:28:16	Now a shadowy someone catches his attention.
428	00:28:21	00:28:23	Is that it?
429	00:28:23	00:28:24	Gone.
430	00:28:24	00:28:28	Sara, they're telling me that I might not get Eli back for months.
431	00:28:28	00:28:29	You need to help me.
432	00:28:29	00:28:31	Tell them you know me.
433	00:28:31	00:28:33	Yeah, I'm sorry, Tina. Really, I am.
434	00:28:33	00:28:35	But there's nothing I can do.
435	00:28:38	00:28:40	Oh, so this is how this works?
436	00:28:40	00:28:47	CSIs just show up, and if I don't let them into my house, then my life just gets ripped away from me?
437	00:28:47	00:28:48	You didn't let us in four years ago.
438	00:28:48	00:28:51	We wanted to be there for you, and then none of this...
439	00:28:52	00:28:54	I have to go back to work now.
440	00:28:54	00:28:56	If I would've let you in, I...
441	00:28:56	00:28:58	I wouldn't be alive.
442	00:29:00	00:29:06	After Warrick died, Eli was the only thing that kept me from ending things.
443	00:29:06	00:29:09	I told myself that he needed me.
444	00:29:09	00:29:13	He was the reason to... to get up, to go through the motions, and...
445	00:29:13	00:29:15	if I would've let you all in...
446	00:29:16	00:29:22	...Eli wouldn't have needed me, and I wasn't gonna let that happen.
447	00:29:24	00:29:28	Eli's always going to need you.
448	00:29:28	00:29:29	And he'll be back, Tina.
449	00:29:32	00:29:35	But you need to find your way back first.
450	00:29:46	00:29:48	The journey of the wandering gym shoes continues.
451	00:29:48	00:29:52	We analyzed trace on the soles--think we've figured where they may have taken their last steps.
452	00:29:52	00:29:56	Trace of rust and auto paint chips in oil-saturated soil.
453	00:29:56	00:29:58	Auto junkyard, no?
454	00:29:58	00:30:00	Why would Ben Drayton have gone there?
455	00:30:00	00:30:03	I can think of more reasons why someone would've taken him there.
456	00:30:03	00:30:04	Junkyard's a secluded place.
457	00:30:04	00:30:06	Late at night.
458	00:30:12	00:30:16	I found a junkyard a mile away from Ben's burger joint.
459	00:30:16	00:30:21	I realize it's a year-old crime scene, so fat chance of evidence, but...
460	00:30:21	00:30:23	He may still be there.
461	00:30:23	00:30:24	Lots of land.
462	00:30:24	00:30:25	Crammed with wreckage.
463	00:30:25	00:30:27	Why take the body anywhere else?
464	00:30:31	00:30:33	All right, thanks.
465	00:30:37	00:30:42	You know, even if there is a body out here, half a million pounds of steel could be on top of it.
466	00:30:42	00:30:43	Yeah.
467	00:30:45	00:30:46	What is that?
468	00:30:46	00:30:48	It is a ten-dollar long shot.
469	00:30:48	00:30:55	(chuckles) I noticed on the surveillance video that Ben Drayton had a find-my-key fob on his keychain.
470	00:30:55	00:31:01	You know, lose your keys, click this button, keychain beeps, find your keys. Yeah, yeah.
471	00:31:01	00:31:03	Well, it's worth a shot.
472	00:31:03	00:31:04	Yep.
473	00:31:31	00:31:33	Well...
474	00:31:33	00:31:40	short of clearing the yard and bringing in ground-penetrating radar, there's nothing to indicate a burial.
475	00:31:40	00:31:43	There's no signs of a soil disturbance anywhere.
476	00:31:43	00:31:46	Yeah, no slabs of suspiciously-poured concrete.
477	00:31:46	00:31:49	(beep pinging) No bones unearthed by helpful dogs.
478	00:31:49	00:31:51	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What?
479	00:31:51	00:31:53	Hit that thing again.
480	00:32:00	00:32:01	No.
481	00:32:23	00:32:25	Yeah, that's Ben Drayton.
482	00:32:28	00:32:30	Died with his boots off.
483	00:32:31	00:32:33	All right, let's get him out here, boys.
484	00:32:33	00:32:36	Jimmy, grab the head.
485	00:32:36	00:32:37	Okay, on three.
486	00:32:37	00:32:40	One, two, three.
487	00:32:56	00:32:58	Bullet's in there.
488	00:32:58	00:32:59	Okay. I'll tell Doc.
489	00:32:59	00:33:03	Killer could've pulled this trunk liner from any one of these wrecks.
490	00:33:03	00:33:07	Bundled the body to contain the blood before digging the grave.
491	00:33:07	00:33:08	That's not all he bundled.
492	00:33:08	00:33:10	Take a look at this hair.
493	00:33:16	00:33:17	Near the victim's feet.
494	00:33:20	00:33:22	Could be from the assailant.
495	00:33:22	00:33:25	James Newman thinks that the universe is granting him wishes.
496	00:33:29	00:33:31	Let's hope that he kept it to three.
497	00:33:37	00:33:39	Russell.
498	00:33:39	00:33:41	Yeah. Uh, the hair that was buried with the bully?
499	00:33:41	00:33:43	I ran the DNA profile against James Newman.
500	00:33:43	00:33:46	It's not his hair, but it is a new lead.
501	00:33:46	00:33:49	Hair shares alleles with James, so the killer...
502	00:33:49	00:33:52	...has to be a male relative of his-- father, brother, son.
503	00:33:52	00:33:54	James is an only child.
504	00:33:54	00:33:55	No kids of his own.
505	00:33:55	00:33:57	Dad in the picture?
506	00:33:57	00:33:58	Certainly is now.
507	00:34:00	00:34:02	Hey.
508	00:34:02	00:34:04	You, uh, balancing your checkbook?
509	00:34:04	00:34:07	No, I'm just following the money-- not mine, by the way.
510	00:34:07	00:34:09	I spoke with James's aunt.
511	00:34:09	00:34:13	She said that nobody knows who James' father is-- Mom would never say.
512	00:34:13	00:34:19	But I figured, guy's killing to protect his son-- maybe he'd help out in other ways.
513	00:34:19	00:34:25	Money. Aunt Jo said that the only financial help that she's gotten has been checks from the mother's life insurance.
514	00:34:25	00:34:28	But she killed herself, so there should be no payment.
515	00:34:28	00:34:33	Exactly why I asked her for the info off of the most recent check she received.
516	00:34:33	00:34:35	I was just entering it now.
517	00:34:38	00:34:40	The checks came from a private account...
518	00:34:42	00:34:44	...opened by Warrick Brown.
519	00:34:44	00:34:47	Warrick opened the account ten years ago.
520	00:34:47	00:34:50	And it has a balance of $50,000.
521	00:34:50	00:34:52	Warrick actually have that much extra cash?
522	00:34:52	00:34:59	I wouldn't have thought so, but even weirder-- the deposits kept getting made into the account after Warrick's death.
523	00:34:59	00:35:01	Banking from beyond.
524	00:35:07	00:35:09	Aaron Voss has been shot.
525	00:35:09	00:35:12	That's the kingpin from Warrick's neighborhood.
526	00:35:12	00:35:17	Well, we know the killer is all about protecting James, you know, making the world safe for him.
527	00:35:17	00:35:20	If Aaron Voss was making that neighborhood a dangerous place...
528	00:35:20	00:35:23	Guardian Angel is going to make it dangerous for Aaron Voss.
529	00:35:28	00:35:30	Kingpin Voss's vehicle?
530	00:35:30	00:35:32	Just got back from the scene.
531	00:35:32	00:35:35	Witnesses said a silver Escalade just pulled up and popped him.
532	00:35:37	00:35:39	Rushed to Desert Palm, stable.
533	00:35:39	00:35:43	Same witnesses gave us a partial plate on the shooter's vehicle.
534	00:35:43	00:35:45	Willing to help when it's the boss who's been shot.
535	00:35:45	00:35:47	Patrol is hunting down the Escalade right now.
536	00:35:47	00:35:53	Russell...yeah, I tracked money wires into the Warrick account that was helping to support James Newman.
537	00:35:53	00:35:55	Funds came from a Nevada corp.
538	00:35:55	00:35:57	XL Industries.
539	00:35:57	00:36:05	They own a number of properties around Vegas-- commercial buildings, apartments, and the junkyard where Ben Drayton's body was buried.
540	00:36:05	00:36:12	So whoever's behind XL Industries killed and buried Ben Drayton on his property, and has been giving money to support James.
541	00:36:12	00:36:13	Who is it?
542	00:36:13	00:36:15	(phone chimes) Oh, hold on a sec.
543	00:36:15	00:36:17	Yeah, Finn.
544	00:36:17	00:36:19	Officers caught up with Voss's shooter.
545	00:36:19	00:36:20	They just brought him in. And?
546	00:36:20	00:36:22	Definitely not our Guardian Angel.
547	00:36:22	00:36:27	He's a 19-year-old banger from another hood who was, uh, making a power grab.
548	00:36:27	00:36:30	Sounds like the same guy who took a shot at Voss last week.
549	00:36:30	00:36:31	We still got our killer out there.
550	00:36:31	00:36:34	Thank you.
551	00:36:34	00:36:36	Russell...
552	00:36:36	00:36:39	...there's only one name associated with XL Industries.
553	00:36:45	00:36:47	I'll get Henry to run DNA, confirm paternity.
554	00:36:50	00:36:52	Hey.
555	00:36:52	00:36:54	Hey.
556	00:36:54	00:36:57	Voss was shot in the front seat, not the, um, trunk.
557	00:36:57	00:37:00	Car is evidence for whatever case we want.
558	00:37:04	00:37:08	This is a trunk liner that was wrapped around Ben Drayton's body.
559	00:37:08	00:37:10	Very d-distinct wear patterns.
560	00:37:16	00:37:19	Aaron Voss killed and dumped Ben Drayton.
561	00:37:19	00:37:24	Wouldn't be the first time a father got hands-on with his son's bully.
562	00:37:24	00:37:25	Voss is James' father?
563	00:37:25	00:37:27	Yeah, how about that, huh?
564	00:37:27	00:37:30	Did you find any trace on the passenger side?
565	00:37:30	00:37:32	Uh, no, I was still working on the driver's side.
566	00:37:32	00:37:36	'Cause the reverend still had the chalk on his shoe from Tina's house.
567	00:37:36	00:37:41	Hadn't walked it off yet, which means he had to have gotten a ride to the cemetery.
568	00:37:41	00:37:44	The car was freshly vacuumed.
569	00:37:53	00:37:56	Well, look at that.
570	00:37:57	00:38:00	Mark of the reverend.
571	00:38:00	00:38:04	Hard to believe that just fell out of his pocket into that crevice.
572	00:38:04	00:38:08	More likely, the reverend knew that when the local crime boss gets you in his car...
573	00:38:10	00:38:12	...You may not be seen again.
574	00:38:16	00:38:24	Probably just stuffed the handkerchief in the cushion here as a Hail Mary bread crumb to get Voss busted.
575	00:38:24	00:38:26	(grunts) For making him kneel one last time.
576	00:38:32	00:38:34	Why Warrick's grave?
577	00:38:34	00:38:38	Maybe as a warning to anyone else who might want to mess with Tina.
578	00:38:38	00:38:41	Stay away from Warrick Brown's family.
579	00:38:41	00:38:43	Warning came too late for Cliff Paul.
580	00:38:47	00:38:48	No, no-no...
581	00:38:57	00:38:58	Homie, I am titanium.
582	00:38:58	00:39:00	Lead can't scratch me.
583	00:39:00	00:39:03	Car wash, cocktail, I'm straight.
584	00:39:03	00:39:06	Yeah, we'll talk how to handle that.
585	00:39:06	00:39:09	All's forgiven and forgotten, Officer.
586	00:39:09	00:39:12	No need to waste community resources.
587	00:39:12	00:39:13	Well, that's very generous of you.
588	00:39:13	00:39:17	So willing to look past the misdeeds of others, even after you take a bullet.
589	00:39:17	00:39:20	Actually, I want to talk to you about your misdeeds.
590	00:39:20	00:39:22	I don't know what you're talking about.
591	00:39:22	00:39:24	We know that you're James's father.
592	00:39:24	00:39:25	DNA proved that.
593	00:39:25	00:39:30	We also know that you've been providing for him, financially, in Warrick Brown's name.
594	00:39:30	00:39:32	You remember Warrick, right?
595	00:39:32	00:39:38	The guy who was the real man in your son's life, not just some scumbag crook.
596	00:39:38	00:39:44	Warrick wanted to play the hero, so I let him... on my dollar.
597	00:39:44	00:39:45	So what?
598	00:39:45	00:39:49	So what is that's not the only way you've been providing for your son.
599	00:39:49	00:39:55	You keep your eyes on him, you know when he's getting into trouble, like when the bully gave him that hard time.
600	00:39:55	00:39:56	You remember that?
601	00:39:56	00:40:09	Or when James was trying to buy a gun from one of your corner guys to protect Warrick's family-- now, you saw that go down and you decided, Well, I'm gonna take care of that myself so my son doesn't have to.
602	00:40:09	00:40:12	Bottom line-- you killed three people.
603	00:40:12	00:40:16	I got to be honest with you...
604	00:40:16	00:40:17	That doesn't sound like me.
605	00:40:17	00:40:19	No? Looking out for a kid...
606	00:40:21	00:40:26	...Protecting him so he can grow up, get out, become something.
607	00:40:28	00:40:33	Why would a scumbag crook like Aaron Voss do something like that?
608	00:40:38	00:40:44	Aaron Voss, you're under arrest for the murders of Ben Drayton, Rick Renken, and Cliff Paul.
609	00:40:44	00:40:45	You have the right to remain silent...
610	00:40:50	00:40:52	Tell you the truth, man...
611	00:40:52	00:40:54	I always liked believing Warrick was my dad.
612	00:40:54	00:40:55	Really?
613	00:40:55	00:40:57	Yeah.
614	00:40:57	00:41:02	Being the son of a guy like Aaron Voss-- I don't know what to do with that.
615	00:41:02	00:41:03	No, you don't have to do anything with it.
616	00:41:03	00:41:06	I mean, Voss doesn't have to mean anything to you.
617	00:41:06	00:41:09	It's not like he ever offered himself as a father.
618	00:41:09	00:41:12	Besides, you don't really need his kind of looking out for you, anyway.
619	00:41:12	00:41:13	You know what I mean?
620	00:41:13	00:41:15	So is he going away?
621	00:41:15	00:41:16	Yeah, he is.
622	00:41:16	00:41:20	And by playing guardian angel to you, he may have just saved that whole neighborhood.
623	00:41:20	00:41:21	Yeah, from him.
624	00:41:21	00:41:23	Exactly.
625	00:41:23	00:41:25	Warrick would be happy.
626	00:41:25	00:41:26	Yeah, I think so.
627	00:41:28	00:41:33	You know, I still hear him talking to me sometimes, you know, when things are going wrong and...
628	00:41:33	00:41:35	I know it sounds crazy.
629	00:41:35	00:41:39	No, it doesn't sound crazy; not to me.
630	00:41:39	00:41:42	Warrick...walks beside me every day.
631	00:41:42	00:41:44	He's the source of a lot of my strength.
632	00:41:46	00:41:48	He's a good friend to have, man.
633	00:41:49	00:41:51	Don't ever let him go.
634	00:41:54	00:41:56	The church is cleaning out the reverend's bad deals.
635	00:41:56	00:41:58	The house is going to stay yours.
636	00:41:59	00:42:10	I... I really appreciate that, and, Sara, about what you said about finding my way back, I'm in--meetings, counseling, whatever it takes.
637	00:42:10	00:42:12	Um, I spoke with CPS.
638	00:42:12	00:42:19	Um, Eli is going to stay with a foster family for a couple of days, but then they're gonna talk to you about what comes next.
639	00:42:24	00:42:26	You know, you, uh...
640	00:42:26	00:42:29	you could have called me with this, Sara.
641	00:42:29	00:42:33	I gave you my number and I--I promise...
642	00:42:33	00:42:34	I'll answer now.
643	00:42:34	00:42:36	Okay.
644	00:42:36	00:42:40	But, um, I wanted you to have a minute.
645	00:42:40	00:42:41	What?
