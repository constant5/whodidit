0,00:00:26,00:00:28,(sighs heavily)
1,00:00:31,00:00:33,"WILLOWS: That's quite a kit you got there, Ray."
2,00:00:33,00:00:34,(chuckles)
3,00:00:34,00:00:35,"Well, it's my first official shift."
4,00:00:35,00:00:37,I want to be prepared.
5,00:00:37,00:00:40,Your training coordinator said that you were very thorough.
6,00:00:40,00:00:53,"Add this to your checklist-- whenever you're on call, have a pen and paper near your bed, along with a change of clothes, a ball cap, bottled water, sunblock, and make sure you got a Thomas Guide inside your vehicle, in case your GPS crashes."
7,00:00:53,00:00:57,You don't want your evidence degrading as you're scrambling to get your act together.
8,00:00:57,00:00:59,Got it.
9,00:00:59,00:01:01,Hey. WILLOWS: Hey.
10,00:01:02,00:01:03,Ready to roll?
11,00:01:03,00:01:05,"STOKES: Oh, yeah."
12,00:01:05,00:01:08,"Dr. Langston, welcome aboard."
13,00:01:08,00:01:09,Thank you.
14,00:01:09,00:01:11,406 on the east side.
15,00:01:11,00:01:12,Ray's with you.
16,00:01:12,00:01:13,Okay.
17,00:01:13,00:01:14,WILLOWS: Enjoy.
18,00:01:14,00:01:18,"406-- burglary. Yeah, a little bread and butter crime'll be the perfect thing to get your feet wet."
19,00:01:18,00:01:19,Come on.
20,00:01:21,00:01:26,"You know you're not required to wear a tie unless you're in court, right?"
21,00:01:26,00:01:28,"Yes, I know."
22,00:01:30,00:01:33,Something wrong with wearing a tie?
23,00:01:33,00:01:35,"No, no."
24,00:01:36,00:01:38,"STOKES: What's going on, Akers?"
25,00:01:38,00:01:41,"Owner got home from work an hour ago, found the window smashed."
26,00:01:41,00:01:44,"His wife's jewelry is gone, along with a laptop and his watch."
27,00:01:44,00:01:45,Where's the wife?
28,00:01:45,00:01:47,Out of town with their daughter.
29,00:01:48,00:01:49,(explosion thunders) The husband's inside.
30,00:01:49,00:01:51,(car alarms blare in distance)
31,00:01:53,00:01:56,What the hell was that?
32,00:01:56,00:01:58,You'll know as soon as I do.
33,00:01:58,00:02:01,"Why don't you, uh, go ahead inside and get started on the overalls, yeah?"
34,00:02:01,00:02:03,DISPATCHER (over radio): Repeat the 20 on the 445 call.
35,00:02:03,00:02:06,"Dispatch, this is Charlie 0-5 Stokes."
36,00:02:08,00:02:10,(sirens wailing in distance)
37,00:02:10,00:02:14,"MAN: No, no, there's nothing to worry about."
38,00:02:14,00:02:16,I'm fine.
39,00:02:17,00:02:18,Okay.
40,00:02:18,00:02:23,"I do, I feel violated, but the police are taking care of everything."
41,00:02:24,00:02:27,That fireball was a private residence near Sunrise Mountain.
42,00:02:27,00:02:29,Arson-Explosives is already on the way.
43,00:02:29,00:02:30,"Are we on our way there, too?"
44,00:02:30,00:02:33,"Oh, yeah, we'll be done with this before the fire's even out."
45,00:02:33,00:02:36,"Just, uh, print the point of entry and collect everything else."
46,00:02:36,00:02:37,"MAN: I love you, too, honey."
47,00:02:37,00:02:40,"Sir, you want to show me where those stolen items were taken from?"
48,00:02:40,00:02:42,I got to go.
49,00:02:42,00:02:43,Right this way.
50,00:02:48,00:02:50,(sighs)
51,00:02:54,00:02:58,"My laptop was right here, my watch right there, and my wife's jewelry box-- they completely cleaned that out."
52,00:02:58,00:03:02,They didn't even bother to ransack the place.
53,00:03:02,00:03:05,Just went straight for the good stuff.
54,00:03:31,00:03:36,"And my wife's grandmother's ring was in there, her mother's cameo."
55,00:03:36,00:03:37,They really cleaned the thing out.
56,00:03:40,00:03:46,Write down everything that was stolen and fax that form back to us.
57,00:03:46,00:03:48,"Be sure and keep a copy for your insurance, okay?"
58,00:03:48,00:03:49,Okay.
59,00:03:59,00:04:01,"What'd you do, try to use all of 'em?"
60,00:04:01,00:04:05,"In the field, you really only need three powders: black, magnetic, and dragon's blood."
61,00:04:05,00:04:09,"If you can't get a print off one of those, you're better off just taking it back to the lab."
62,00:04:10,00:04:11,It just kept breaking up.
63,00:04:11,00:04:14,All right.
64,00:04:14,00:04:18,Doorknob's already toast; let's work on the glass.
65,00:04:20,00:04:24,"Now, don't do this if you ever need touch DNA, but in a pinch..."
66,00:04:28,00:04:32,The water vapor from your breath will adhere to the salt and lipids in a latent print.
67,00:04:32,00:04:35,It revitalizes it.
68,00:04:35,00:04:37,(exhales)
69,00:04:37,00:04:41,Then you take a little dust-- just a little.
70,00:04:43,00:04:45,Gently.
71,00:04:50,00:04:52,It's all in the wrist.
72,00:04:54,00:05:01,"A colleague of mine once told me if I found myself in this part of town, I should drive very fast."
73,00:05:01,00:05:03,"Well, that's pretty good advice."
74,00:05:03,00:05:05,We get about half a dozen calls out here a week.
75,00:05:05,00:05:09,There is a little no-tell motel around here somewhere.
76,00:05:09,00:05:10,We found a corpse underneath a bed.
77,00:05:10,00:05:12,It'd been there for about four days.
78,00:05:12,00:05:17,(chuckles) People just went right on using the room till it was too ripe to ignore.
79,00:05:17,00:05:20,Did you catch the guy who did it?
80,00:05:20,00:05:22,"Yeah, yeah, we did eventually."
81,00:05:22,00:05:24,Then that's a good story.
82,00:05:25,00:05:34,"Dispatch, Charlie 0-5 Stokes and Charlie 0-8 Langston, reporting 402-419 Sunrise Mountain."
83,00:05:36,00:05:38,"How's the first day of school going, Professor?"
84,00:05:38,00:05:41,"I'll, uh, tell you at recess."
85,00:05:47,00:05:51,The arson investigator ran dogs through the scene.
86,00:05:51,00:05:53,They didn't find any accelerant.
87,00:05:53,00:05:56,STOKES: Doesn't rule out arson.
88,00:05:56,00:05:59,What's with the construction equipment out front?
89,00:05:59,00:06:02,Were the owners remodeling or something?
90,00:06:02,00:06:05,"Well, the place belongs to Don and Paulla Kingsley."
91,00:06:06,00:06:09,They live here alone.
92,00:06:10,00:06:12,I got a call out to both of them.
93,00:06:13,00:06:15,I bet only one of them calls me back.
94,00:07:17,00:07:19,ECKLIE: So where'd it all go?
95,00:07:20,00:07:24,I can't imagine Grissom being entirely happy without his irradiated fetal pig.
96,00:07:25,00:07:30,"He asked me to send a couple things to the research station in Costa Rica, and..."
97,00:07:31,00:07:33,the rest is just going into storage at his place.
98,00:07:33,00:07:37,"Hmm, so he didn't sell his home?"
99,00:07:37,00:07:39,A condo in Vegas?
100,00:07:39,00:07:41,That's 50 cents on the dollar at this point.
101,00:07:41,00:07:44,"Yeah, tell me about it."
102,00:07:44,00:07:46,"Well, you got a blank canvas."
103,00:07:46,00:07:47,You're senior supervisor.
104,00:07:47,00:07:49,It's your office now.
105,00:07:49,00:07:51,"Oh, I like the one I have."
106,00:07:51,00:07:52,"Catherine, if you don't want it, fine."
107,00:07:52,00:07:54,"But you can't leave it empty, all right?"
108,00:07:54,00:07:56,We don't have the space for a shrine.
109,00:08:09,00:08:11,Paulla Kingsley? It's gone.
110,00:08:11,00:08:12,It's all gone.
111,00:08:14,00:08:16,Paulla Kingsley?
112,00:08:16,00:08:19,I'm Mrs. Kingsley's assistant Carla Banks.
113,00:08:19,00:08:20,I didn't want her to drive herself.
114,00:08:20,00:08:22,I need Don. W-Where's Don?
115,00:08:22,00:08:24,"We're not sure, ma'am."
116,00:08:24,00:08:26,"He's, he's not-- Was he inside?"
117,00:08:26,00:08:27,We found someone inside.
118,00:08:27,00:08:30,It's going to take a while before we find out who that is.
119,00:08:30,00:08:32,"Mrs. Kingsley, I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police."
120,00:08:32,00:08:33,Do you mind if I ask you a question?
121,00:08:33,00:08:36,"According to the fire department, this isn't their first time out here."
122,00:08:36,00:08:40,You called 911 about six weeks ago when your husband overdosed on secobarbital.
123,00:08:40,00:08:43,"Is that right? (sobbing): Oh, my God."
124,00:08:43,00:08:44,Don.
125,00:08:57,00:08:59,This looks like it was the laundry room.
126,00:08:59,00:09:05,Everything's displaced outward...
127,00:09:05,00:09:07,from this point.
128,00:09:07,00:09:11,Blast originated here.
129,00:09:13,00:09:18,Sooting indicates that the water heater inlet was unhooked during the fire.
130,00:09:18,00:09:20,Maybe it was torn off by the blast.
131,00:09:20,00:09:23,"If that were the case, these threads would be stripped and they're not."
132,00:09:23,00:09:27,That's the natural gas line hookup right there.
133,00:09:28,00:09:31,"See if that valve's open or closed for me, would you?"
134,00:09:33,00:09:34,It's open.
135,00:09:34,00:09:37,If at first you don't succeed...
136,00:09:43,00:09:45,(hissing)
137,00:09:47,00:09:52,BRASS: So would you say that Don Kingsley was having emotional problems?
138,00:09:52,00:09:53,"Yeah, Mr. Kingsley was depressed."
139,00:09:53,00:09:55,They'd been having some difficulties.
140,00:09:55,00:09:56,What kind of difficulties?
141,00:09:57,00:09:59,Financial.
142,00:09:59,00:10:01,Where was Mrs. Kingsley last night?
143,00:10:01,00:10:02,At the gym.
144,00:10:02,00:10:05,"Buff &amp;amp;amp; Tuff Fitness Center. Well, the fire started just after midnight."
145,00:10:05,00:10:07,Does she usually work out that late?
146,00:10:07,00:10:08,No. She owns the franchise.
147,00:10:08,00:10:11,Six locations across Vegas. Open 24/7.
148,00:10:11,00:10:14,So we're going to need the name of Mr. Kingsley's dentist.
149,00:10:14,00:10:15,Can you help me with that?
150,00:10:15,00:10:18,"Yeah, sure."
151,00:10:18,00:10:21,LANGSTON: Aren't we required to run DNA on the victim?
152,00:10:21,00:10:23,No. We're only required to confirm I.D.
153,00:10:23,00:10:26,Fires sometimes destroy known exemplars.
154,00:10:26,00:10:28,Dental records are just quicker.
155,00:10:29,00:10:33,"Boy, I bet you've never seen one of those in the hospital before, huh?"
156,00:10:33,00:10:35,Once. He was still screaming.
157,00:10:36,00:10:38,"PHILLIPS: Okay, we're ready."
158,00:10:39,00:10:42,"Now remember, lift with your legs."
159,00:10:42,00:10:44,On three.
160,00:10:44,00:10:47,"One, two, three."
161,00:10:47,00:10:49,"(flesh crackling, body thuds)"
162,00:10:51,00:10:53,(coughs)
163,00:10:54,00:10:55,Here you go. I'll take that.
164,00:10:55,00:10:57,(coughs)
165,00:10:57,00:10:58,PHILLIPS: You okay?
166,00:10:58,00:10:59,I'm fine.
167,00:10:59,00:11:00,Again?
168,00:11:00,00:11:02,Let's go.
169,00:11:02,00:11:06,"One, two, three."
170,00:11:06,00:11:09,"Whoa, the bones feel... crumbly."
171,00:11:10,00:11:13,Like they were... (groans) shattered.
172,00:11:13,00:11:16,That's what happens when they're in the oven too long.
173,00:11:16,00:11:18,Uh...
174,00:11:22,00:11:24,What should we do about that?
175,00:11:24,00:11:27,It could have trace from the body?
176,00:11:27,00:11:28,"Yes, sir."
177,00:11:28,00:11:30,It's evidence?
178,00:11:33,00:11:36,Do you have a pair of scissors I could borrow?
179,00:11:43,00:11:45,Thanks.
180,00:12:15,00:12:18,Excuse me.
181,00:12:19,00:12:21,"David Hodges, right?"
182,00:12:21,00:12:23,"I need to, um..."
183,00:12:23,00:12:26,You need to log that in with the evidence clerk first.
184,00:12:26,00:12:30,And then he will distribute it to the appropriate lab.
185,00:12:30,00:12:32,Right-- the evidence clerk isn't there.
186,00:12:33,00:12:35,"Yeah, he never is."
187,00:12:35,00:12:38,And that's your problem.
188,00:12:46,00:12:49,Okay... fine.
189,00:12:49,00:12:52,"So, now, I'll dohisjob."
190,00:13:04,00:13:06,(Hodges clears throat)
191,00:13:10,00:13:11,May I help you?
192,00:13:13,00:13:15,Just check it in.
193,00:13:16,00:13:19,Fill out this form.
194,00:13:26,00:13:28,"Well, you certainly have a doctor's handwriting."
195,00:13:28,00:13:30,"Next time, print."
196,00:13:30,00:13:32,"There you are, Professor."
197,00:13:32,00:13:35,Nick stuck me with your 406.
198,00:13:35,00:13:37,Doesn't get you off of it.
199,00:13:37,00:13:40,I'll meet you in the A.V. Lab.
200,00:13:44,00:13:48,The laptop on the stolen property list has a cell phone card in it with G.P.S.
201,00:13:48,00:13:50,That means we can track it.
202,00:13:50,00:13:52,"Yeah, well, we are in luck."
203,00:13:52,00:13:55,This laptop's on a mesh network right now.
204,00:13:58,00:13:59,You bought my book.
205,00:14:00,00:14:02,Yeah.
206,00:14:03,00:14:05,Did you read it?
207,00:14:07,00:14:09,Yeah.
208,00:14:09,00:14:13,Guess that makes you one of the few.
209,00:14:15,00:14:17,(computer beeps)
210,00:14:17,00:14:19,ARCHIE: I got an address.
211,00:14:33,00:14:35,"If you're looking for drugs, you're not going to find any."
212,00:14:35,00:14:37,My son's not into that stuff.
213,00:14:37,00:14:38,"Right, Alex?"
214,00:14:38,00:14:41,"ADAMS: We're not looking for drugs, sir."
215,00:14:45,00:14:48,(Wi-Fi detector beeping)
216,00:14:51,00:14:53,"Mr. Palento, what's back here?"
217,00:14:53,00:14:57,His bedroom.
218,00:15:06,00:15:09,(detector beeping faster)
219,00:15:11,00:15:13,"(beeping rapidly, then stops)"
220,00:15:26,00:15:28,"Yes, it's on the list."
221,00:15:28,00:15:31,Where'd it come from?
222,00:15:31,00:15:32,I don't know; I found it. Where?
223,00:15:32,00:15:35,I can't remember exactly. Oh.
224,00:15:35,00:15:39,"Alex, if you're screwing with me, you're in serious trouble."
225,00:15:45,00:15:47,"You find these things, too?"
226,00:15:47,00:15:49,Some kids in the neighborhood.
227,00:15:49,00:15:50,They gave them to me.
228,00:15:50,00:15:52,Like who?
229,00:15:52,00:15:54,I can't remember.
230,00:15:55,00:16:00,Your son could easily be going out at night and having other people come in without your knowledge.
231,00:16:00,00:16:02,"No, no, no, I keep that alley gate locked."
232,00:16:02,00:16:03,He doesn't have a key.
233,00:16:03,00:16:04,Where'd you get that stuff?
234,00:16:04,00:16:06,What difference does it make?
235,00:16:06,00:16:07,That's not an answer! LANGSTON: Hey.
236,00:16:07,00:16:09,That's not necessary.
237,00:16:09,00:16:11,"Oh, you don't approve? As a matter of fact, I don't."
238,00:16:13,00:16:16,Do you have any idea what it's like to be a single father in this town?
239,00:16:16,00:16:18,I got two friends who had their kids O.D. on them.
240,00:16:18,00:16:20,Don't you tell me how to handle my son.
241,00:16:20,00:16:22,"We wouldn't dream of it, sir."
242,00:16:22,00:16:24,ADAMS: I apologize if we overstepped.
243,00:16:24,00:16:26,MR. PALENTO: Come on.
244,00:16:27,00:16:28,In the house. I'm not done...
245,00:16:28,00:16:30,(door closes)
246,00:16:33,00:16:34,"What, it's not our job to protect him?"
247,00:16:34,00:16:38,"His father let us in here without a warrant, and he wasn't breaking any laws."
248,00:16:38,00:16:39,We're here to collect evidence.
249,00:16:39,00:16:42,We're not social workers.
250,00:17:10,00:17:13,"You see the ""Ma...""?"
251,00:17:13,00:17:15,My guess is the glass came from a Mason jar.
252,00:17:15,00:17:18,My wife uses them to make fruit preserves.
253,00:17:18,00:17:22,"Oh, well, I doubt this guy was canning explosive peaches."
254,00:17:22,00:17:26,I hope I haven't missed all the fun stuff.
255,00:17:26,00:17:27,"Hello, Doctor."
256,00:17:27,00:17:29,"My name is-- Ray Langston, I know."
257,00:17:29,00:17:30,Albert Robbins.
258,00:17:30,00:17:33,Always happy to meet a fellow sawbones.
259,00:17:33,00:17:35,You've already met Don Kingsley.
260,00:17:37,00:17:40,And that is shrapnel from the explosion.
261,00:17:41,00:17:42,And what's this yellow residue?
262,00:17:42,00:17:44,That's not my department.
263,00:17:44,00:17:46,I sent a sample to Hodges. He's in Trace.
264,00:17:46,00:17:48,We've met.
265,00:17:48,00:17:51,Glass shards are only in his feet and lower legs.
266,00:17:56,00:17:58,I was just about to dissect his trachea.
267,00:17:58,00:17:59,Care to do the honors?
268,00:18:00,00:18:01,It's been a while since I cut.
269,00:18:01,00:18:04,"Eh, it's like destroying a bicycle-- come on."
270,00:18:29,00:18:31,Oh... no soot.
271,00:18:31,00:18:33,This man wasn't breathing while the fire was burning.
272,00:18:33,00:18:36,"So, he croaked before he cooked."
273,00:18:36,00:18:38,"Well, that would explain the calvarium."
274,00:18:38,00:18:40,It's cracked along the sutures.
275,00:18:40,00:18:41,Is that from the fire?
276,00:18:41,00:18:45,"Well, it gets hot enough to boil a brain, the, uh, steam has to get out somehow."
277,00:18:45,00:18:48,(sizzling)
278,00:18:52,00:18:54,That's not what I was going to show you.
279,00:18:58,00:18:59,Subdural hematoma.
280,00:19:00,00:19:00,ROBBINS: Mm-hmm.
281,00:19:01,00:19:05,"So, he was clocked before he croaked and cooked."
282,00:19:11,00:19:16,"Congratulations, Ray. Your first arson has become your first homicide."
283,00:19:26,00:19:28,Somebody could've hit him with this.
284,00:19:28,00:19:33,"Yeah, that or just about anything else in here that didn't get burned up or washed away."
285,00:19:35,00:19:43,"Okay, we should bag everything that might have been used as a weapon or a remote or a delayed ignition source."
286,00:19:43,00:19:46,Since it's pretty obvious the arsonist wasn't in here when this place went up.
287,00:19:47,00:19:48,All right.
288,00:19:48,00:19:50,Piece of cake.
289,00:20:05,00:20:08,"Excuse me, sir?"
290,00:20:08,00:20:11,"You, uh, mind if I ask what you're doing here?"
291,00:20:11,00:20:13,Documenting my losses.
292,00:20:13,00:20:14,Your losses?
293,00:20:14,00:20:16,I'm Josh Barston. The Kingsleys' contractor.
294,00:20:16,00:20:19,"All that gear is mine. Luckily, it's insured."
295,00:20:19,00:20:20,Did you do all the construction here?
296,00:20:20,00:20:21,Yep.
297,00:20:22,00:20:24,Everything's up to code. I got all the permits.
298,00:20:24,00:20:27,"Well, that's good, 'cause I'm going to need copies of all your plans and construction photos."
299,00:20:27,00:20:31,"As well as contact information for you and your crew, if you don't mind."
300,00:20:31,00:20:32,"Sure, whatever you want."
301,00:21:17,00:21:20,That's a lot of concentration for a property crime.
302,00:21:20,00:21:21,I think it just paid off.
303,00:21:21,00:21:29,This is a pawn shop receipt for an antique cameo and a diamond ring-- the only two items left missing.
304,00:21:29,00:21:31,"Our suspect is, what, 14 years old?"
305,00:21:31,00:21:33,He didn't pawn these things by himself.
306,00:21:33,00:21:36,WILLOWS: You sure you don't want to give this a shot?
307,00:21:36,00:21:38,LANGSTON: I'd prefer to watch you.
308,00:21:41,00:21:45,"Magnetic powder works best on porous surfaces, because it doesn't smear."
309,00:21:45,00:21:47,I hear it's all in the wrist.
310,00:21:47,00:21:51,"WILLOWS: Actually, I think it's in the fingers, but that's me."
311,00:22:00,00:22:01,Nice!
312,00:22:01,00:22:04,Mm! The scanner's behind us.
313,00:22:23,00:22:24,DianePalento?
314,00:22:25,00:22:26,The kid's mother.
315,00:22:27,00:22:29,Priors for shoplifting and...
316,00:22:29,00:22:32,"ah, narcotics possession."
317,00:22:32,00:22:34,ADAMS: That's your mother pawning stolen property.
318,00:22:34,00:22:37,You didn't get that stuff from the neighborhood kids.
319,00:22:37,00:22:39,"Your mother gave it to you, didn't she, Alex?"
320,00:22:39,00:22:41,She didn't steal it.
321,00:22:41,00:22:43,She bought it from a garage sale.
322,00:22:43,00:22:45,You've been seeing her?
323,00:22:45,00:22:48,Taking presents from her and lying to me about it?
324,00:22:48,00:22:49,So what?
325,00:22:50,00:22:51,You lied to me.
326,00:22:52,00:22:53,Said that she moved to New York.
327,00:22:54,00:22:55,She didn't love me anymore.
328,00:22:55,00:22:57,I did it to protect... It's not true!
329,00:22:57,00:22:58,"I did it to protect you, Alex."
330,00:22:58,00:23:01,"Your mother has problems, (over speaker): and she's not doing anything to help herself!"
331,00:23:01,00:23:04,"Yes, she is. Yes, she is!"
332,00:23:04,00:23:05,"ALEX: She's getting her act together, okay?"
333,00:23:05,00:23:09,Saving up for a nice apartment so she and I can live together.
334,00:23:09,00:23:16,"You are not going anywhere except juvenile hall, because receiving stolen property-- that's a crime."
335,00:23:16,00:23:18,Stealing is a bigger crime.
336,00:23:19,00:23:22,"I know you're not a thief, Alex."
337,00:23:22,00:23:23,You're a good kid.
338,00:23:23,00:23:25,You made some bad decisions.
339,00:23:25,00:23:35,"I know you two love each other, but your mom made some bad decisions, too, and I can't help her unless you help me."
340,00:23:35,00:23:37,"That duffel bag is hers, isn't it?"
341,00:23:39,00:23:42,When does she come around?
342,00:23:42,00:23:44,She sleeps there at night.
343,00:23:44,00:23:46,She stays on the floor.
344,00:23:47,00:23:51,"Look, it's just for a while, okay?"
345,00:23:51,00:23:53,She's gonna get her own place.
346,00:23:53,00:23:55,We're gonna live together.
347,00:24:01,00:24:02,ADAMS: It won't be much of a stakeout.
348,00:24:03,00:24:06,I doubt we'll have to set up on her more than one night.
349,00:24:06,00:24:07,She'll show up.
350,00:24:07,00:24:08,Bad parents crave unconditional love.
351,00:24:08,00:24:09,"Well, I know I do."
352,00:24:10,00:24:12,I'll put a couple guys on it.
353,00:24:12,00:24:14,I really think you broke through to him.
354,00:24:14,00:24:18,I was just trying to get him to give up his mother.
355,00:24:19,00:24:20,"Thanks for the uni's, Captain."
356,00:24:20,00:24:22,"Sure thing, no problem."
357,00:24:25,00:24:26,"STOKES: Hey, Jim."
358,00:24:26,00:24:28,I got the crispy critter's cell phone records.
359,00:24:28,00:24:33,And get this-- the wife's assistant called 23 times in the 48 hours prior to his death.
360,00:24:33,00:24:34,BRASS: Sounds like more than a working relationship.
361,00:24:35,00:24:36,"Yeah, I'd say so."
362,00:24:36,00:24:38,You're gonna love the voice mails she left him.
363,00:24:38,00:24:41,(dance music playing)
364,00:24:50,00:24:51,Good.
365,00:25:06,00:25:07,"That's impressive, Carla."
366,00:25:07,00:25:11,"So, tell me, where were you on the night of the fire?"
367,00:25:11,00:25:12,I was here working.
368,00:25:12,00:25:15,You don't have to take my word for it.
369,00:25:15,00:25:17,There's surveillance all over this place.
370,00:25:17,00:25:19,"No, I'm not going to take your word for it-- check this out."
371,00:25:19,00:25:24,"CARLA: Don, I'm standing outside your house, and once again, you're not here."
372,00:25:24,00:25:26,"I warned you not to pull another no-show, you gutless son of a bitch."
373,00:25:26,00:25:28,I want toseeyou tonight.
374,00:25:31,00:25:36,"Okay, I was at Don's house last night a little before 11:00, but I left right after that."
375,00:25:37,00:25:39,What were you doing at my house last night?
376,00:25:39,00:25:42,Trying to get the 20 Gs your husband owed me.
377,00:25:42,00:25:46,What are you talking about? You know those herbal supplements he tried to get you to sell here?
378,00:25:47,00:25:48,"Yeah, the ones that give you diarrhea?"
379,00:25:48,00:25:50,I fronted him the money for that.
380,00:25:50,00:25:54,"He said it might be a good way for us to earn some money on the side, and like an idiot, I believed him."
381,00:25:54,00:25:55,Did you sleep with him?
382,00:25:55,00:25:56,I don't sleep with losers.
383,00:25:56,00:25:57,Don wasn't a loser.
384,00:25:57,00:25:59,"Come on, Paulla."
385,00:25:59,00:26:01,He was a nice guy...
386,00:26:01,00:26:02,Complete airhead.
387,00:26:02,00:26:03,You outgrew him years ago.
388,00:26:03,00:26:05,You just couldn't admit it.
389,00:26:05,00:26:06,"BRASS: Hey, hey."
390,00:26:06,00:26:08,"L-L-Ladies, ladies... Bitch!"
391,00:26:08,00:26:10,What's wrong with you? Let's go down to the police station.
392,00:26:10,00:26:13,"We can make your statements on record, okay?"
393,00:26:14,00:26:16,I'll give you a ride.
394,00:26:23,00:26:26,A power cord to nowhere.
395,00:26:27,00:26:30,I don't remember seeing any appliances missing their cords.
396,00:26:42,00:26:45,"Greg, will you come take a look at this, please?"
397,00:26:50,00:26:55,We found residue like that on glass shards taken out of Don Kingsley's body.
398,00:26:55,00:26:58,SANDERS: Looks like galvanized metal.
399,00:26:58,00:27:01,Maybe a piece of roof flashing.
400,00:27:01,00:27:04,Did you I.D. the residue on the glass?
401,00:27:04,00:27:06,"Hodges is working on it, I hope."
402,00:27:08,00:27:10,SANDERS: Grid 13.
403,00:27:14,00:27:19,"Well, we found it about seven feet from the origin."
404,00:27:24,00:27:28,These marks look like the result of an electrical arc.
405,00:27:28,00:27:33,"And in a room filled with gas, an arc is as good as a spark."
406,00:27:33,00:27:34,Okay.
407,00:27:34,00:27:38,But there's got to be more to a timed detonator than this.
408,00:27:38,00:27:40,I agree.
409,00:27:44,00:27:46,Looks like we're working a double.
410,00:27:48,00:27:51,HODGES: The residue on the metal disc is indeed what was found on the glass shards.
411,00:27:52,00:27:53,Zea mays.
412,00:27:53,00:27:56,"Well, my botany's a little rusty, but I'd say..."
413,00:27:56,00:27:57,corn.
414,00:27:57,00:27:59,I call it maize.
415,00:27:59,00:28:01,Are you trying to impress me?
416,00:28:02,00:28:04,Did I?
417,00:28:07,00:28:13,"So, we've got corn, a Mason jar, a piece of metal roof flashing and an electrical cord."
418,00:28:13,00:28:15,How do you make a detonator out of that?
419,00:28:16,00:28:18,I don't know.
420,00:28:19,00:28:21,You don't know.
421,00:28:22,00:28:25,"That's not your reputation, Mr. Hodges."
422,00:28:31,00:28:33,(murmuring)
423,00:28:36,00:28:41,"I'm telling you, every time I turn around, one of these uni's is giving us the stink eye."
424,00:28:41,00:28:44,"Come on now, you're imagining that. No, I'm not."
425,00:28:44,00:28:46,That's what happens when you make a lab geek undersheriff.
426,00:28:46,00:28:48,"Oh, that job is punishment enough."
427,00:28:48,00:28:50,I actually feel sorry for Ecklie.
428,00:28:50,00:28:52,(laughing)
429,00:28:52,00:28:53,"You like burned toast, Ray?"
430,00:28:53,00:28:55,"Occasionally, but, uh..."
431,00:28:55,00:28:57,I've seen enough charcoal for one day.
432,00:28:57,00:28:59,"Oh, man."
433,00:28:59,00:29:00,WILLOWS: What?
434,00:29:00,00:29:01,Look at that.
435,00:29:05,00:29:06,"You see that? Yeah, I do."
436,00:29:06,00:29:08,(all groaning)
437,00:29:08,00:29:10,See that?
438,00:29:10,00:29:13,No wonder why Grissom loves this place.
439,00:29:13,00:29:14,(all groaning)
440,00:29:14,00:29:16,"WILLOWS: You didn't just do that, did you?"
441,00:29:16,00:29:18,What?
442,00:29:18,00:29:19,(laughing): Ew!
443,00:29:19,00:29:20,"Check, please."
444,00:29:20,00:29:21,It's on me.
445,00:29:22,00:29:24,"The new guy pays, right?"
446,00:29:25,00:29:26,Only if he's smart.
447,00:29:26,00:29:27,Thank you.
448,00:29:27,00:29:28,SANDERS: Thank you.
449,00:29:28,00:29:29,It's my shift on the Palento stakeout.
450,00:29:29,00:29:31,You coming? Yes.
451,00:29:31,00:29:33,"Oh, hey, Ray, I'll, uh, I'll give you a lift."
452,00:29:33,00:29:35,"Okay, thanks."
453,00:29:35,00:29:39,"So, Nicky, Mr. Eater-of-Flies..."
454,00:29:39,00:29:40,Hmm.
455,00:29:40,00:29:42,(sighs)
456,00:29:42,00:29:43,...I want you to have Grissom's office.
457,00:29:45,00:29:47,I thought you were gonna use it.
458,00:29:47,00:29:49,I hate moving.
459,00:29:49,00:29:50,I don't know about that.
460,00:29:50,00:29:52,Doesn't really feel right.
461,00:29:52,00:29:55,"Well, it may not for a while, but..."
462,00:29:55,00:29:57,Make it your own.
463,00:30:00,00:30:02,(doorbells jingle)
464,00:30:14,00:30:16,Maybe she won't show up.
465,00:30:18,00:30:20,Kind of sounds like you're hoping she won't.
466,00:30:20,00:30:23,She's not helping her son.
467,00:30:23,00:30:27,Maybe not.
468,00:30:27,00:30:30,But...
469,00:30:30,00:30:32,"he's making choices here, too."
470,00:30:32,00:30:34,"Yes, he is."
471,00:30:38,00:30:40,Mommy's home.
472,00:30:40,00:30:42,We're moving now.
473,00:30:49,00:30:50,LVPD. Hold it right there.
474,00:30:50,00:30:51,Leave me alone!
475,00:30:51,00:30:52,Get her! Leave me alone!
476,00:30:52,00:30:54,Ray?
477,00:30:54,00:30:57,No! No!
478,00:30:57,00:30:58,Let me see my kid!
479,00:30:58,00:31:00,"ADAMS: Diane Palento, you're under arrest."
480,00:31:00,00:31:02,Let me... Let me see my kid!
481,00:31:02,00:31:04,Alex! Alex!
482,00:31:05,00:31:07,Don't take her! It was me!
483,00:31:07,00:31:09,I took that stuff! Don't take her!
484,00:31:09,00:31:10,"Alex, baby!"
485,00:31:10,00:31:11,Get off her!
486,00:31:11,00:31:13,I'm coming back.
487,00:31:13,00:31:14,"I love you, Mom."
488,00:31:14,00:31:16,"I love you, Alex! (sobbing)"
489,00:31:16,00:31:19,I love you!
490,00:32:24,00:32:26,"(machinery beeping, whirring quietly)"
491,00:32:32,00:32:33,What is this?
492,00:32:34,00:32:41,"Corn, glass jar, metal disk-- a chance to salvage your reputation."
493,00:32:45,00:32:48,(engine sputters)
494,00:32:52,00:32:54,(engine starts)
495,00:33:07,00:33:10,What the hell is this?
496,00:33:10,00:33:13,A corn meal bomb.
497,00:33:13,00:33:15,"Apparently, it's an old military trick."
498,00:33:15,00:33:20,"As the corn meal absorbs the water, it expands, pushing up the metal disc."
499,00:33:20,00:33:27,"But the process is pretty slow, which gives you time to fill the room with gas and leave."
500,00:33:27,00:33:32,"Eventually, the metal disc touches the two exposed wires and..."
501,00:33:40,00:33:42,An explosion and an alibi.
502,00:33:42,00:33:44,All in one.
503,00:33:46,00:33:47,Okay...
504,00:33:49,00:33:51,I'm impressed.
505,00:34:00,00:34:06,"I had to cut the metal disc by hand to get it to fit in the Mason jar, which means the suspect did, too."
506,00:34:06,00:34:12,I think we should go back through the evidence from the Kingsley garage and do tool mark comparisons on anything that could have been used to cut the disc.
507,00:34:12,00:34:15,"Well, that can take a couple of weeks, assuming the tool's even there."
508,00:34:15,00:34:18,"And even if it is there, you still have to connect it directly to a suspect."
509,00:34:18,00:34:20,"Well, one step at a time, right? Right."
510,00:34:20,00:34:21,Let's see what Archie has for us.
511,00:34:21,00:34:23,"Hey, man, I got your text."
512,00:34:23,00:34:25,What's going on?
513,00:34:25,00:34:28,Hey. Check this out.
514,00:34:28,00:34:32,"This is earlier, the day of the murder."
515,00:34:33,00:34:35,STOKES: Where did you get this?
516,00:34:35,00:34:37,Brass pulled it from Paulla Kingsley's gym.
517,00:34:42,00:34:44,JOHNSON: 10:07.
518,00:34:44,00:34:47,That's about two hours before the fire.
519,00:34:47,00:34:48,You know what that means...
520,00:34:48,00:34:53,"Yeah, it means he had motive, and time to set the detonator."
521,00:34:53,00:35:02,"It's always sad when a husband gets in the way of his wife's blossoming relationship with their contractor, hmm?"
522,00:35:02,00:35:04,It was strictly platonic.
523,00:35:04,00:35:10,"I was in crisis, and Josh was a good listener."
524,00:35:10,00:35:12,"Oh, I'm sure he was."
525,00:35:12,00:35:20,"I'm sure he listened to you complain about your financial situation, and what a loser your airhead husband is."
526,00:35:22,00:35:24,"So, whose idea was it to kill Don?"
527,00:35:24,00:35:26,Was it yours or Josh's?
528,00:35:26,00:35:31,"What are you saying, that Josh killed my husband?"
529,00:35:34,00:35:37,"Oh, my God."
530,00:35:37,00:35:39,I'm going to be sick.
531,00:35:39,00:35:42,We were in love.
532,00:35:44,00:35:47,"She was going to leave him, so we could be together."
533,00:35:51,00:35:53,She lost her nerve.
534,00:35:54,00:35:57,PAULLA: I told Josh that I couldn't leave Don.
535,00:35:59,00:36:01,That I...
536,00:36:01,00:36:05,That I still loved him despite his flaws.
537,00:36:07,00:36:09,JOSH: That loser.
538,00:36:09,00:36:11,He was taking her down with him.
539,00:36:13,00:36:15,I realized there was only one way to save her.
540,00:36:17,00:36:19,So I built the detonator.
541,00:36:21,00:36:24,"And after I took her to work, I took care of the problem."
542,00:36:24,00:36:29,Told Don there was a problem with the gas line in the garage.
543,00:36:29,00:36:31,(chuckles)
544,00:36:35,00:36:37,Check out the pilot light.
545,00:36:45,00:36:49,(gas hissing)
546,00:36:55,00:36:57,He was holding her hostage.
547,00:36:59,00:37:01,(inhales deeply)
548,00:37:01,00:37:03,And I set her free.
549,00:37:03,00:37:05,(exhales)
550,00:37:08,00:37:12,Brass just closed your arson-murder.
551,00:37:12,00:37:13,Contractor confessed.
552,00:37:13,00:37:15,Nice work.
553,00:37:15,00:37:17,Thanks.
554,00:37:17,00:37:19,"I thought that this one was closed, too."
555,00:37:19,00:37:21,It is.
556,00:37:21,00:37:24,Then why are you wasting the taxpayers' money?
557,00:37:26,00:37:28,I'm kidding. (wry laugh)
558,00:37:28,00:37:31,Um...
559,00:37:31,00:37:32,a rock... Mm-hmm.
560,00:37:33,00:37:34,...through a window.
561,00:37:34,00:37:38,Don't you think Diane Palento was a little too street smart to make that much noise breaking in?
562,00:37:40,00:37:43,"The owner came home, said he..."
563,00:37:44,00:37:45,discovered he had been robbed.
564,00:37:45,00:37:47,So why was his laptop still in the house?
565,00:37:47,00:37:49,Wouldn't that have been at work with him?
566,00:37:49,00:37:52,And look-- his watch.
567,00:37:52,00:37:55,"Most guys take their watches off to shower, or to..."
568,00:37:55,00:37:57,"to swim, to, uh... Have sex."
569,00:37:57,00:37:59,Except his wife was out of town that weekend.
570,00:38:01,00:38:03,"So, I checked his web history."
571,00:38:03,00:38:05,Take a look at this.
572,00:38:05,00:38:09,"""Diamond."" AKA Diane Palento."
573,00:38:09,00:38:11,Very classy.
574,00:38:11,00:38:19,"The husband hires himself a hooker, and after, when he passes out or takes a shower, she rips him off."
575,00:38:19,00:38:25,"He might be able to explain away the laptop and the watch, but not his wife's jewelry."
576,00:38:26,00:38:28,I think he decided to stage a...
577,00:38:28,00:38:30,fake break-in.
578,00:38:32,00:38:34,(rubbing hands together) Shall we go bust him now?
579,00:38:34,00:38:38,The only thing that we could get him for is filing a false report.
580,00:38:38,00:38:45,"It's a misdemeanor, and the D.A. would never prosecute, so, you got to just return the property and call it a day."
581,00:38:45,00:38:47,A good day.
582,00:38:52,00:38:58,"My grandfather gave this to my grandmother in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, in 1914."
583,00:38:58,00:39:00,Never thought that I'd see it again.
584,00:39:00,00:39:01,I can't thank you enough.
585,00:39:01,00:39:03,Tell him how you lost it.
586,00:39:03,00:39:06,"What, does that matter?"
587,00:39:06,00:39:07,Tell him.
588,00:39:07,00:39:09,"That's not really necessary, ma'am. Would you...?"
589,00:39:09,00:39:10,Can we please just go?
590,00:39:10,00:39:13,"Don't you touch me, you diseased pervert."
591,00:39:13,00:39:15,"Oh, come on, I made a mistake, honey."
592,00:39:15,00:39:20,"A mistake? You brought a whore into our bedroom, and you had disgusting sex with her on my bed."
593,00:39:20,00:39:27,"No, I did not have disgusting sex-- I told you-- I got drunk and passed out, because subconsciously, honey, I could not go through with it."
594,00:39:27,00:39:29,"Well, subconsciously, I can't stay married to a degenerate sleazeball."
595,00:39:29,00:39:31,I've never done anything like this before.
596,00:39:31,00:39:32,I've never done anything like...
597,00:39:32,00:39:33,How can I even trust you?
598,00:39:33,00:39:35,Come on! I didn't even get to do anything.
599,00:39:35,00:39:37,"Oh, so now you're disappointed you didn't get to foul our sheets..."
600,00:39:48,00:39:57,"Alex, listen, I know you feel as if you betrayed your mother, but believe me, it may be the best thing that ever happened to her."
601,00:39:59,00:40:02,Your mother's going to need your help.
602,00:40:02,00:40:05,You may be the only person that she'll listen to.
603,00:40:05,00:40:12,"I know it's not a fair thing to ask of a 14-year-old kid, but you've got to be strong for her."
604,00:40:14,00:40:17,Try to get her to go to a rehab program.
605,00:40:17,00:40:20,"I can get you a list of places, if you like."
606,00:40:45,00:40:47,You sure you're okay with this?
607,00:40:47,00:40:49,You can still change your mind.
608,00:40:49,00:40:51,"ADAMS: No, you can't."
609,00:40:51,00:40:53,"I said I'd kill for an office, and I meant it."
610,00:40:53,00:40:56,Even a shared one.
611,00:40:56,00:40:59,"Wow. This is a very classy move, Nick."
612,00:40:59,00:41:01,Very classy.
613,00:41:01,00:41:03,Seriously.
614,00:41:03,00:41:05,"Well, you're welcome."
615,00:41:05,00:41:07,There's good energy in here.
616,00:41:07,00:41:09,It'll be nice to share it.
617,00:41:14,00:41:17,This belongs here.
618,00:42:09,00:42:11,We're off the clock.
619,00:42:11,00:42:13,I know.
620,00:42:17,00:42:19,I'll see you tomorrow.
