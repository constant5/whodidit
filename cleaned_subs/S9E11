0	00:00:31	00:00:33	That's quite a kit you got there, Ray.
1	00:00:34	00:00:35	Well, it's my first official shift.
2	00:00:35	00:00:37	I want to be prepared.
3	00:00:37	00:00:40	Your training coordinator said that you were very thorough.
4	00:00:40	00:00:53	Add this to your checklist-- whenever you're on call, have a pen and paper near your bed, along with a change of clothes, a ball cap, bottled water, sunblock, and make sure you got a Thomas Guide inside your vehicle, in case your GPS crashes.
5	00:00:53	00:00:57	You don't want your evidence degrading as you're scrambling to get your act together.
6	00:00:57	00:00:59	Got it.
7	00:00:59	00:01:01	Hey.
8	00:01:02	00:01:03	Ready to roll?
9	00:01:03	00:01:05	Oh, yeah.
10	00:01:05	00:01:08	Dr. Langston, welcome aboard.
11	00:01:08	00:01:09	Thank you.
12	00:01:09	00:01:11	406 on the east side.
13	00:01:11	00:01:12	Ray's with you.
14	00:01:12	00:01:13	Okay.
15	00:01:13	00:01:14	Enjoy.
16	00:01:14	00:01:18	406-- burglary. Yeah, a little bread and butter crime'll be the perfect thing to get your feet wet.
17	00:01:18	00:01:19	Come on.
18	00:01:21	00:01:26	You know you're not required to wear a tie unless you're in court, right?
19	00:01:26	00:01:28	Yes, I know.
20	00:01:30	00:01:33	Something wrong with wearing a tie?
21	00:01:33	00:01:35	No, no.
22	00:01:36	00:01:38	What's going on, Akers?
23	00:01:38	00:01:41	Owner got home from work an hour ago, found the window smashed.
24	00:01:41	00:01:44	His wife's jewelry is gone, along with a laptop and his watch.
25	00:01:44	00:01:45	Where's the wife?
26	00:01:45	00:01:47	Out of town with their daughter.
27	00:01:48	00:01:49	(explosion thunders) The husband's inside.
28	00:01:53	00:01:56	What the hell was that?
29	00:01:56	00:01:58	You'll know as soon as I do.
30	00:01:58	00:02:01	Why don't you, uh, go ahead inside and get started on the overalls, yeah?
31	00:02:01	00:02:03	Repeat the 20 on the 445 call.
32	00:02:03	00:02:06	Dispatch, this is Charlie 0-5 Stokes.
33	00:02:10	00:02:14	No, no, there's nothing to worry about.
34	00:02:14	00:02:16	I'm fine.
35	00:02:17	00:02:18	Okay.
36	00:02:18	00:02:23	I do, I feel violated, but the police are taking care of everything.
37	00:02:24	00:02:27	That fireball was a private residence near Sunrise Mountain.
38	00:02:27	00:02:29	Arson-Explosives is already on the way.
39	00:02:29	00:02:30	Are we on our way there, too?
40	00:02:30	00:02:33	Oh, yeah, we'll be done with this before the fire's even out.
41	00:02:33	00:02:36	Just, uh, print the point of entry and collect everything else.
42	00:02:36	00:02:37	I love you, too, honey.
43	00:02:37	00:02:40	Sir, you want to show me where those stolen items were taken from?
44	00:02:40	00:02:42	I got to go.
45	00:02:42	00:02:43	Right this way.
46	00:02:54	00:02:58	My laptop was right here, my watch right there, and my wife's jewelry box-- they completely cleaned that out.
47	00:02:58	00:03:02	They didn't even bother to ransack the place.
48	00:03:02	00:03:05	Just went straight for the good stuff.
49	00:03:31	00:03:36	And my wife's grandmother's ring was in there, her mother's cameo.
50	00:03:36	00:03:37	They really cleaned the thing out.
51	00:03:40	00:03:46	Write down everything that was stolen and fax that form back to us.
52	00:03:46	00:03:48	Be sure and keep a copy for your insurance, okay?
53	00:03:48	00:03:49	Okay.
54	00:03:59	00:04:01	What'd you do, try to use all of 'em?
55	00:04:03	00:04:05	black, magnetic, and dragon's blood.
56	00:04:05	00:04:09	If you can't get a print off one of those, you're better off just taking it back to the lab.
57	00:04:10	00:04:11	It just kept breaking up.
58	00:04:11	00:04:14	All right.
59	00:04:14	00:04:18	Doorknob's already toast; let's work on the glass.
60	00:04:20	00:04:24	Now, don't do this if you ever need touch DNA, but in a pinch...
61	00:04:28	00:04:32	The water vapor from your breath will adhere to the salt and lipids in a latent print.
62	00:04:32	00:04:35	It revitalizes it.
63	00:04:37	00:04:41	Then you take a little dust-- just a little.
64	00:04:43	00:04:45	Gently.
65	00:04:50	00:04:52	It's all in the wrist.
66	00:04:54	00:05:01	A colleague of mine once told me if I found myself in this part of town, I should drive very fast.
67	00:05:01	00:05:03	Well, that's pretty good advice.
68	00:05:03	00:05:05	We get about half a dozen calls out here a week.
69	00:05:05	00:05:09	There is a little no-tell motel around here somewhere.
70	00:05:09	00:05:10	We found a corpse underneath a bed.
71	00:05:10	00:05:12	It'd been there for about four days.
72	00:05:12	00:05:17	(chuckles) People just went right on using the room till it was too ripe to ignore.
73	00:05:17	00:05:20	Did you catch the guy who did it?
74	00:05:20	00:05:22	Yeah, yeah, we did eventually.
75	00:05:22	00:05:24	Then that's a good story.
76	00:05:25	00:05:34	Dispatch, Charlie 0-5 Stokes and Charlie 0-8 Langston, reporting 402-419 Sunrise Mountain.
77	00:05:36	00:05:38	How's the first day of school going, Professor?
78	00:05:38	00:05:41	I'll, uh, tell you at recess.
79	00:05:47	00:05:51	The arson investigator ran dogs through the scene.
80	00:05:51	00:05:53	They didn't find any accelerant.
81	00:05:53	00:05:56	Doesn't rule out arson.
82	00:05:56	00:05:59	What's with the construction equipment out front?
83	00:05:59	00:06:02	Were the owners remodeling or something?
84	00:06:02	00:06:05	Well, the place belongs to Don and Paulla Kingsley.
85	00:06:06	00:06:09	They live here alone.
86	00:06:10	00:06:12	I got a call out to both of them.
87	00:06:13	00:06:15	I bet only one of them calls me back.
88	00:07:17	00:07:19	So where'd it all go?
89	00:07:20	00:07:24	I can't imagine Grissom being entirely happy without his irradiated fetal pig.
90	00:07:25	00:07:30	He asked me to send a couple things to the research station in Costa Rica, and...
91	00:07:31	00:07:33	the rest is just going into storage at his place.
92	00:07:33	00:07:37	Hmm, so he didn't sell his home?
93	00:07:37	00:07:39	A condo in Vegas?
94	00:07:39	00:07:41	That's 50 cents on the dollar at this point.
95	00:07:41	00:07:44	Yeah, tell me about it.
96	00:07:44	00:07:46	Well, you got a blank canvas.
97	00:07:46	00:07:47	You're senior supervisor.
98	00:07:47	00:07:49	It's your office now.
99	00:07:49	00:07:51	Oh, I like the one I have.
100	00:07:51	00:07:52	Catherine, if you don't want it, fine.
101	00:07:52	00:07:54	But you can't leave it empty, all right?
102	00:07:54	00:07:56	We don't have the space for a shrine.
103	00:08:09	00:08:11	Paulla Kingsley? It's gone.
104	00:08:11	00:08:12	It's all gone.
105	00:08:14	00:08:16	Paulla Kingsley?
106	00:08:16	00:08:19	I'm Mrs. Kingsley's assistant Carla Banks.
107	00:08:19	00:08:20	I didn't want her to drive herself.
108	00:08:20	00:08:22	I need Don. W-Where's Don?
109	00:08:22	00:08:24	We're not sure, ma'am.
110	00:08:24	00:08:26	He's, he's not-- Was he inside?
111	00:08:26	00:08:27	We found someone inside.
112	00:08:27	00:08:30	It's going to take a while before we find out who that is.
113	00:08:30	00:08:32	Mrs. Kingsley, I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.
114	00:08:32	00:08:33	Do you mind if I ask you a question?
115	00:08:33	00:08:36	According to the fire department, this isn't their first time out here.
116	00:08:36	00:08:40	You called 911 about six weeks ago when your husband overdosed on secobarbital.
117	00:08:40	00:08:43	Oh, my God.
118	00:08:43	00:08:44	Don.
119	00:08:57	00:08:59	This looks like it was the laundry room.
120	00:08:59	00:09:05	Everything's displaced outward...
121	00:09:05	00:09:07	from this point.
122	00:09:07	00:09:11	Blast originated here.
123	00:09:13	00:09:18	Sooting indicates that the water heater inlet was unhooked during the fire.
124	00:09:18	00:09:20	Maybe it was torn off by the blast.
125	00:09:20	00:09:23	If that were the case, these threads would be stripped and they're not.
126	00:09:23	00:09:27	That's the natural gas line hookup right there.
127	00:09:28	00:09:31	See if that valve's open or closed for me, would you?
128	00:09:33	00:09:34	It's open.
129	00:09:34	00:09:37	If at first you don't succeed...
130	00:09:47	00:09:52	So would you say that Don Kingsley was having emotional problems?
131	00:09:52	00:09:53	Yeah, Mr. Kingsley was depressed.
132	00:09:53	00:09:55	They'd been having some difficulties.
133	00:09:55	00:09:56	What kind of difficulties?
134	00:09:57	00:09:59	Financial.
135	00:09:59	00:10:01	Where was Mrs. Kingsley last night?
136	00:10:01	00:10:02	At the gym.
137	00:10:02	00:10:05	Buff &amp;amp;amp; Tuff Fitness Center. Well, the fire started just after midnight.
138	00:10:05	00:10:07	Does she usually work out that late?
139	00:10:07	00:10:08	No. She owns the franchise.
140	00:10:08	00:10:11	Six locations across Vegas. Open 24/7.
141	00:10:11	00:10:14	So we're going to need the name of Mr. Kingsley's dentist.
142	00:10:14	00:10:15	Can you help me with that?
143	00:10:15	00:10:18	Yeah, sure.
144	00:10:18	00:10:21	Aren't we required to run DNA on the victim?
145	00:10:21	00:10:23	No. We're only required to confirm I.D.
146	00:10:23	00:10:26	Fires sometimes destroy known exemplars.
147	00:10:26	00:10:28	Dental records are just quicker.
148	00:10:29	00:10:33	Boy, I bet you've never seen one of those in the hospital before, huh?
149	00:10:33	00:10:35	Once. He was still screaming.
150	00:10:36	00:10:38	Okay, we're ready.
151	00:10:39	00:10:42	Now remember, lift with your legs.
152	00:10:42	00:10:44	On three.
153	00:10:44	00:10:47	One, two, three.
154	00:10:54	00:10:55	Here you go. I'll take that.
155	00:10:57	00:10:58	You okay?
156	00:10:58	00:10:59	I'm fine.
157	00:10:59	00:11:00	Again?
158	00:11:00	00:11:02	Let's go.
159	00:11:02	00:11:06	One, two, three.
160	00:11:06	00:11:09	Whoa, the bones feel... crumbly.
161	00:11:10	00:11:13	Like they were... (groans) shattered.
162	00:11:13	00:11:16	That's what happens when they're in the oven too long.
163	00:11:16	00:11:18	Uh...
164	00:11:22	00:11:24	What should we do about that?
165	00:11:24	00:11:27	It could have trace from the body?
166	00:11:27	00:11:28	Yes, sir.
167	00:11:28	00:11:30	It's evidence?
168	00:11:33	00:11:36	Do you have a pair of scissors I could borrow?
169	00:11:43	00:11:45	Thanks.
170	00:12:15	00:12:18	Excuse me.
171	00:12:19	00:12:21	David Hodges, right?
172	00:12:21	00:12:23	I need to, um...
173	00:12:23	00:12:26	You need to log that in with the evidence clerk first.
174	00:12:26	00:12:30	And then he will distribute it to the appropriate lab.
175	00:12:30	00:12:32	Right-- the evidence clerk isn't there.
176	00:12:33	00:12:35	Yeah, he never is.
177	00:12:35	00:12:38	And that's your problem.
178	00:12:46	00:12:49	Okay... fine.
179	00:12:49	00:12:52	So, now, I'll do his job.
180	00:13:10	00:13:11	May I help you?
181	00:13:13	00:13:15	Just check it in.
182	00:13:16	00:13:19	Fill out this form.
183	00:13:26	00:13:28	Well, you certainly have a doctor's handwriting.
184	00:13:28	00:13:30	Next time, print.
185	00:13:30	00:13:32	There you are, Professor.
186	00:13:32	00:13:35	Nick stuck me with your 406.
187	00:13:35	00:13:37	Doesn't get you off of it.
188	00:13:37	00:13:40	I'll meet you in the A.V. Lab.
189	00:13:44	00:13:48	The laptop on the stolen property list has a cell phone card in it with G.P.S.
190	00:13:48	00:13:50	That means we can track it.
191	00:13:50	00:13:52	Yeah, well, we are in luck.
192	00:13:52	00:13:55	This laptop's on a mesh network right now.
193	00:13:58	00:13:59	You bought my book.
194	00:14:00	00:14:02	Yeah.
195	00:14:03	00:14:05	Did you read it?
196	00:14:07	00:14:09	Yeah.
197	00:14:09	00:14:13	Guess that makes you one of the few.
198	00:14:17	00:14:19	I got an address.
199	00:14:33	00:14:35	If you're looking for drugs, you're not going to find any.
200	00:14:35	00:14:37	My son's not into that stuff.
201	00:14:37	00:14:38	Right, Alex?
202	00:14:38	00:14:41	We're not looking for drugs, sir.
203	00:14:51	00:14:53	Mr. Palento, what's back here?
204	00:14:53	00:14:57	His bedroom.
205	00:15:26	00:15:28	Yes, it's on the list.
206	00:15:28	00:15:31	Where'd it come from?
207	00:15:31	00:15:32	I don't know; I found it. Where?
208	00:15:32	00:15:35	I can't remember exactly. Oh.
209	00:15:35	00:15:39	Alex, if you're screwing with me, you're in serious trouble.
210	00:15:45	00:15:47	You find these things, too?
211	00:15:47	00:15:49	Some kids in the neighborhood.
212	00:15:49	00:15:50	They gave them to me.
213	00:15:50	00:15:52	Like who?
214	00:15:52	00:15:54	I can't remember.
215	00:15:55	00:16:00	Your son could easily be going out at night and having other people come in without your knowledge.
216	00:16:00	00:16:02	No, no, no, I keep that alley gate locked.
217	00:16:02	00:16:03	He doesn't have a key.
218	00:16:03	00:16:04	Where'd you get that stuff?
219	00:16:04	00:16:06	What difference does it make?
220	00:16:06	00:16:07	Hey.
221	00:16:07	00:16:09	That's not necessary.
222	00:16:09	00:16:11	Oh, you don't approve? As a matter of fact, I don't.
223	00:16:13	00:16:16	Do you have any idea what it's like to be a single father in this town?
224	00:16:16	00:16:18	I got two friends who had their kids O.D. on them.
225	00:16:18	00:16:20	Don't you tell me how to handle my son.
226	00:16:20	00:16:22	We wouldn't dream of it, sir.
227	00:16:22	00:16:24	I apologize if we overstepped.
228	00:16:24	00:16:26	Come on.
229	00:16:27	00:16:28	In the house. I'm not done...
230	00:16:33	00:16:34	What, it's not our job to protect him?
231	00:16:34	00:16:38	His father let us in here without a warrant, and he wasn't breaking any laws.
232	00:16:38	00:16:39	We're here to collect evidence.
233	00:16:39	00:16:42	We're not social workers.
234	00:17:10	00:17:13	You see the Ma...?
235	00:17:13	00:17:15	My guess is the glass came from a Mason jar.
236	00:17:15	00:17:18	My wife uses them to make fruit preserves.
237	00:17:18	00:17:22	Oh, well, I doubt this guy was canning explosive peaches.
238	00:17:22	00:17:26	I hope I haven't missed all the fun stuff.
239	00:17:26	00:17:27	Hello, Doctor.
240	00:17:27	00:17:29	My name is-- Ray Langston, I know.
241	00:17:29	00:17:30	Albert Robbins.
242	00:17:30	00:17:33	Always happy to meet a fellow sawbones.
243	00:17:33	00:17:35	You've already met Don Kingsley.
244	00:17:37	00:17:40	And that is shrapnel from the explosion.
245	00:17:41	00:17:42	And what's this yellow residue?
246	00:17:42	00:17:44	That's not my department.
247	00:17:44	00:17:46	I sent a sample to Hodges. He's in Trace.
248	00:17:46	00:17:48	We've met.
249	00:17:48	00:17:51	Glass shards are only in his feet and lower legs.
250	00:17:56	00:17:58	I was just about to dissect his trachea.
251	00:17:58	00:17:59	Care to do the honors?
252	00:18:00	00:18:01	It's been a while since I cut.
253	00:18:01	00:18:04	Eh, it's like destroying a bicycle-- come on.
254	00:18:29	00:18:31	Oh... no soot.
255	00:18:31	00:18:33	This man wasn't breathing while the fire was burning.
256	00:18:33	00:18:36	So, he croaked before he cooked.
257	00:18:36	00:18:38	Well, that would explain the calvarium.
258	00:18:38	00:18:40	It's cracked along the sutures.
259	00:18:40	00:18:41	Is that from the fire?
260	00:18:41	00:18:45	Well, it gets hot enough to boil a brain, the, uh, steam has to get out somehow.
261	00:18:52	00:18:54	That's not what I was going to show you.
262	00:18:58	00:18:59	Subdural hematoma.
263	00:19:00	00:19:00	Mm-hmm.
264	00:19:01	00:19:05	So, he was clocked before he croaked and cooked.
265	00:19:11	00:19:16	Congratulations, Ray. Your first arson has become your first homicide.
266	00:19:26	00:19:28	Somebody could've hit him with this.
267	00:19:28	00:19:33	Yeah, that or just about anything else in here that didn't get burned up or washed away.
268	00:19:35	00:19:43	Okay, we should bag everything that might have been used as a weapon or a remote or a delayed ignition source.
269	00:19:43	00:19:46	Since it's pretty obvious the arsonist wasn't in here when this place went up.
270	00:19:47	00:19:48	All right.
271	00:19:48	00:19:50	Piece of cake.
272	00:20:05	00:20:08	Excuse me, sir?
273	00:20:08	00:20:11	You, uh, mind if I ask what you're doing here?
274	00:20:11	00:20:13	Documenting my losses.
275	00:20:13	00:20:14	Your losses?
276	00:20:14	00:20:16	I'm Josh Barston. The Kingsleys' contractor.
277	00:20:16	00:20:19	All that gear is mine. Luckily, it's insured.
278	00:20:19	00:20:20	Did you do all the construction here?
279	00:20:20	00:20:21	Yep.
280	00:20:22	00:20:24	Everything's up to code. I got all the permits.
281	00:20:24	00:20:27	Well, that's good, 'cause I'm going to need copies of all your plans and construction photos.
282	00:20:27	00:20:31	As well as contact information for you and your crew, if you don't mind.
283	00:20:31	00:20:32	Sure, whatever you want.
284	00:21:17	00:21:20	That's a lot of concentration for a property crime.
285	00:21:20	00:21:21	I think it just paid off.
286	00:21:21	00:21:29	This is a pawn shop receipt for an antique cameo and a diamond ring-- the only two items left missing.
287	00:21:29	00:21:31	Our suspect is, what, 14 years old?
288	00:21:31	00:21:33	He didn't pawn these things by himself.
289	00:21:33	00:21:36	You sure you don't want to give this a shot?
290	00:21:36	00:21:38	I'd prefer to watch you.
291	00:21:41	00:21:45	Magnetic powder works best on porous surfaces, because it doesn't smear.
292	00:21:45	00:21:47	I hear it's all in the wrist.
293	00:21:47	00:21:51	Actually, I think it's in the fingers, but that's me.
294	00:22:00	00:22:01	Nice!
295	00:22:01	00:22:04	Mm! The scanner's behind us.
296	00:22:23	00:22:24	Diane Palento?
297	00:22:25	00:22:26	The kid's mother.
298	00:22:27	00:22:29	Priors for shoplifting and...
299	00:22:29	00:22:32	ah, narcotics possession.
300	00:22:32	00:22:34	That's your mother pawning stolen property.
301	00:22:34	00:22:37	You didn't get that stuff from the neighborhood kids.
302	00:22:37	00:22:39	Your mother gave it to you, didn't she, Alex?
303	00:22:39	00:22:41	She didn't steal it.
304	00:22:41	00:22:43	She bought it from a garage sale.
305	00:22:43	00:22:45	You've been seeing her?
306	00:22:45	00:22:48	Taking presents from her and lying to me about it?
307	00:22:48	00:22:49	So what?
308	00:22:50	00:22:51	You lied to me.
309	00:22:52	00:22:53	Said that she moved to New York.
310	00:22:54	00:22:55	She didn't love me anymore.
311	00:22:55	00:22:57	I did it to protect... It's not true!
312	00:22:57	00:22:58	I did it to protect you, Alex.
313	00:22:58	00:23:01	Your mother has problems, and she's not doing anything to help herself!
314	00:23:01	00:23:04	Yes, she is. Yes, she is!
315	00:23:04	00:23:05	She's getting her act together, okay?
316	00:23:05	00:23:09	Saving up for a nice apartment so she and I can live together.
317	00:23:09	00:23:16	You are not going anywhere except juvenile hall, because receiving stolen property-- that's a crime.
318	00:23:16	00:23:18	Stealing is a bigger crime.
319	00:23:19	00:23:22	I know you're not a thief, Alex.
320	00:23:22	00:23:23	You're a good kid.
321	00:23:23	00:23:25	You made some bad decisions.
322	00:23:25	00:23:35	I know you two love each other, but your mom made some bad decisions, too, and I can't help her unless you help me.
323	00:23:35	00:23:37	That duffel bag is hers, isn't it?
324	00:23:39	00:23:42	When does she come around?
325	00:23:42	00:23:44	She sleeps there at night.
326	00:23:44	00:23:46	She stays on the floor.
327	00:23:47	00:23:51	Look, it's just for a while, okay?
328	00:23:51	00:23:53	She's gonna get her own place.
329	00:23:53	00:23:55	We're gonna live together.
330	00:24:01	00:24:02	It won't be much of a stakeout.
331	00:24:03	00:24:06	I doubt we'll have to set up on her more than one night.
332	00:24:06	00:24:07	She'll show up.
333	00:24:07	00:24:08	Bad parents crave unconditional love.
334	00:24:08	00:24:09	Well, I know I do.
335	00:24:10	00:24:12	I'll put a couple guys on it.
336	00:24:12	00:24:14	I really think you broke through to him.
337	00:24:14	00:24:18	I was just trying to get him to give up his mother.
338	00:24:19	00:24:20	Thanks for the uni's, Captain.
339	00:24:20	00:24:22	Sure thing, no problem.
340	00:24:25	00:24:26	Hey, Jim.
341	00:24:26	00:24:28	I got the crispy critter's cell phone records.
342	00:24:28	00:24:33	And get this-- the wife's assistant called 23 times in the 48 hours prior to his death.
343	00:24:33	00:24:34	Sounds like more than a working relationship.
344	00:24:35	00:24:36	Yeah, I'd say so.
345	00:24:36	00:24:38	You're gonna love the voice mails she left him.
346	00:24:50	00:24:51	Good.
347	00:25:06	00:25:07	That's impressive, Carla.
348	00:25:07	00:25:11	So, tell me, where were you on the night of the fire?
349	00:25:11	00:25:12	I was here working.
350	00:25:12	00:25:15	You don't have to take my word for it.
351	00:25:15	00:25:17	There's surveillance all over this place.
352	00:25:17	00:25:19	No, I'm not going to take your word for it-- check this out.
353	00:25:19	00:25:24	Don, I'm standing outside your house, and once again, you're not here.
354	00:25:24	00:25:26	I warned you not to pull another no-show, you gutless son of a bitch.
355	00:25:26	00:25:28	I want to see you tonight.
356	00:25:31	00:25:36	00, but I left right after that.
357	00:25:37	00:25:39	What were you doing at my house last night?
358	00:25:39	00:25:42	Trying to get the 20 Gs your husband owed me.
359	00:25:42	00:25:46	What are you talking about? You know those herbal supplements he tried to get you to sell here?
360	00:25:47	00:25:48	Yeah, the ones that give you diarrhea?
361	00:25:48	00:25:50	I fronted him the money for that.
362	00:25:50	00:25:54	He said it might be a good way for us to earn some money on the side, and like an idiot, I believed him.
363	00:25:54	00:25:55	Did you sleep with him?
364	00:25:55	00:25:56	I don't sleep with losers.
365	00:25:56	00:25:57	Don wasn't a loser.
366	00:25:57	00:25:59	Come on, Paulla.
367	00:25:59	00:26:01	He was a nice guy...
368	00:26:01	00:26:02	Complete airhead.
369	00:26:02	00:26:03	You outgrew him years ago.
370	00:26:03	00:26:05	You just couldn't admit it.
371	00:26:05	00:26:06	Hey, hey.
372	00:26:06	00:26:08	L-L-Ladies, ladies... Bitch!
373	00:26:08	00:26:10	What's wrong with you? Let's go down to the police station.
374	00:26:10	00:26:13	We can make your statements on record, okay?
375	00:26:14	00:26:16	I'll give you a ride.
376	00:26:23	00:26:26	A power cord to nowhere.
377	00:26:27	00:26:30	I don't remember seeing any appliances missing their cords.
378	00:26:42	00:26:45	Greg, will you come take a look at this, please?
379	00:26:50	00:26:55	We found residue like that on glass shards taken out of Don Kingsley's body.
380	00:26:55	00:26:58	Looks like galvanized metal.
381	00:26:58	00:27:01	Maybe a piece of roof flashing.
382	00:27:01	00:27:04	Did you I.D. the residue on the glass?
383	00:27:04	00:27:06	Hodges is working on it, I hope.
384	00:27:08	00:27:10	Grid 13.
385	00:27:14	00:27:19	Well, we found it about seven feet from the origin.
386	00:27:24	00:27:28	These marks look like the result of an electrical arc.
387	00:27:28	00:27:33	And in a room filled with gas, an arc is as good as a spark.
388	00:27:33	00:27:34	Okay.
389	00:27:34	00:27:38	But there's got to be more to a timed detonator than this.
390	00:27:38	00:27:40	I agree.
391	00:27:44	00:27:46	Looks like we're working a double.
392	00:27:48	00:27:51	The residue on the metal disc is indeed what was found on the glass shards.
393	00:27:52	00:27:53	Zea mays.
394	00:27:53	00:27:56	Well, my botany's a little rusty, but I'd say...
395	00:27:56	00:27:57	corn.
396	00:27:57	00:27:59	I call it maize.
397	00:27:59	00:28:01	Are you trying to impress me?
398	00:28:02	00:28:04	Did I?
399	00:28:07	00:28:13	So, we've got corn, a Mason jar, a piece of metal roof flashing and an electrical cord.
400	00:28:13	00:28:15	How do you make a detonator out of that?
401	00:28:16	00:28:18	I don't know.
402	00:28:19	00:28:21	You don't know.
403	00:28:22	00:28:25	That's not your reputation, Mr. Hodges.
404	00:28:36	00:28:41	I'm telling you, every time I turn around, one of these uni's is giving us the stink eye.
405	00:28:41	00:28:44	Come on now, you're imagining that. No, I'm not.
406	00:28:44	00:28:46	That's what happens when you make a lab geek undersheriff.
407	00:28:46	00:28:48	Oh, that job is punishment enough.
408	00:28:48	00:28:50	I actually feel sorry for Ecklie.
409	00:28:52	00:28:53	You like burned toast, Ray?
410	00:28:53	00:28:55	Occasionally, but, uh...
411	00:28:55	00:28:57	I've seen enough charcoal for one day.
412	00:28:57	00:28:59	Oh, man.
413	00:28:59	00:29:00	What?
414	00:29:00	00:29:01	Look at that.
415	00:29:05	00:29:06	You see that? Yeah, I do.
416	00:29:08	00:29:10	See that?
417	00:29:10	00:29:13	No wonder why Grissom loves this place.
418	00:29:14	00:29:16	You didn't just do that, did you?
419	00:29:16	00:29:18	What?
420	00:29:18	00:29:19	Ew!
421	00:29:19	00:29:20	Check, please.
422	00:29:20	00:29:21	It's on me.
423	00:29:22	00:29:24	The new guy pays, right?
424	00:29:25	00:29:26	Only if he's smart.
425	00:29:26	00:29:27	Thank you.
426	00:29:27	00:29:28	Thank you.
427	00:29:28	00:29:29	It's my shift on the Palento stakeout.
428	00:29:29	00:29:31	You coming? Yes.
429	00:29:31	00:29:33	Oh, hey, Ray, I'll, uh, I'll give you a lift.
430	00:29:33	00:29:35	Okay, thanks.
431	00:29:35	00:29:39	So, Nicky, Mr. Eater-of-Flies...
432	00:29:39	00:29:40	Hmm.
433	00:29:42	00:29:43	...I want you to have Grissom's office.
434	00:29:45	00:29:47	I thought you were gonna use it.
435	00:29:47	00:29:49	I hate moving.
436	00:29:49	00:29:50	I don't know about that.
437	00:29:50	00:29:52	Doesn't really feel right.
438	00:29:52	00:29:55	Well, it may not for a while, but...
439	00:29:55	00:29:57	Make it your own.
440	00:30:14	00:30:16	Maybe she won't show up.
441	00:30:18	00:30:20	Kind of sounds like you're hoping she won't.
442	00:30:20	00:30:23	She's not helping her son.
443	00:30:23	00:30:27	Maybe not.
444	00:30:27	00:30:30	But...
445	00:30:30	00:30:32	he's making choices here, too.
446	00:30:32	00:30:34	Yes, he is.
447	00:30:38	00:30:40	Mommy's home.
448	00:30:40	00:30:42	We're moving now.
449	00:30:49	00:30:50	LVPD. Hold it right there.
450	00:30:50	00:30:51	Leave me alone!
451	00:30:51	00:30:52	Get her! Leave me alone!
452	00:30:52	00:30:54	Ray?
453	00:30:54	00:30:57	No! No!
454	00:30:57	00:30:58	Let me see my kid!
455	00:30:58	00:31:00	Diane Palento, you're under arrest.
456	00:31:00	00:31:02	Let me... Let me see my kid!
457	00:31:02	00:31:04	Alex! Alex!
458	00:31:05	00:31:07	Don't take her! It was me!
459	00:31:07	00:31:09	I took that stuff! Don't take her!
460	00:31:09	00:31:10	Alex, baby!
461	00:31:10	00:31:11	Get off her!
462	00:31:11	00:31:13	I'm coming back.
463	00:31:13	00:31:14	I love you, Mom.
464	00:31:14	00:31:16	I love you, Alex! (sobbing)
465	00:31:16	00:31:19	I love you!
466	00:32:32	00:32:33	What is this?
467	00:32:34	00:32:41	Corn, glass jar, metal disk-- a chance to salvage your reputation.
468	00:33:07	00:33:10	What the hell is this?
469	00:33:10	00:33:13	A corn meal bomb.
470	00:33:13	00:33:15	Apparently, it's an old military trick.
471	00:33:15	00:33:20	As the corn meal absorbs the water, it expands, pushing up the metal disc.
472	00:33:20	00:33:27	But the process is pretty slow, which gives you time to fill the room with gas and leave.
473	00:33:27	00:33:32	Eventually, the metal disc touches the two exposed wires and...
474	00:33:40	00:33:42	An explosion and an alibi.
475	00:33:42	00:33:44	All in one.
476	00:33:46	00:33:47	Okay...
477	00:33:49	00:33:51	I'm impressed.
478	00:34:00	00:34:06	I had to cut the metal disc by hand to get it to fit in the Mason jar, which means the suspect did, too.
479	00:34:06	00:34:12	I think we should go back through the evidence from the Kingsley garage and do tool mark comparisons on anything that could have been used to cut the disc.
480	00:34:12	00:34:15	Well, that can take a couple of weeks, assuming the tool's even there.
481	00:34:15	00:34:18	And even if it is there, you still have to connect it directly to a suspect.
482	00:34:18	00:34:20	Well, one step at a time, right? Right.
483	00:34:20	00:34:21	Let's see what Archie has for us.
484	00:34:21	00:34:23	Hey, man, I got your text.
485	00:34:23	00:34:25	What's going on?
486	00:34:25	00:34:28	Hey. Check this out.
487	00:34:28	00:34:32	This is earlier, the day of the murder.
488	00:34:33	00:34:35	Where did you get this?
489	00:34:35	00:34:37	Brass pulled it from Paulla Kingsley's gym.
490	00:34:42	00:34:47	10 That's about two hours before the fire.
491	00:34:47	00:34:48	You know what that means...
492	00:34:48	00:34:53	Yeah, it means he had motive, and time to set the detonator.
493	00:34:53	00:35:02	It's always sad when a husband gets in the way of his wife's blossoming relationship with their contractor, hmm?
494	00:35:02	00:35:04	It was strictly platonic.
495	00:35:04	00:35:10	I was in crisis, and Josh was a good listener.
496	00:35:10	00:35:12	Oh, I'm sure he was.
497	00:35:12	00:35:20	I'm sure he listened to you complain about your financial situation, and what a loser your airhead husband is.
498	00:35:22	00:35:24	So, whose idea was it to kill Don?
499	00:35:24	00:35:26	Was it yours or Josh's?
500	00:35:26	00:35:31	What are you saying, that Josh killed my husband?
501	00:35:34	00:35:37	Oh, my God.
502	00:35:37	00:35:39	I'm going to be sick.
503	00:35:39	00:35:42	We were in love.
504	00:35:44	00:35:47	She was going to leave him, so we could be together.
505	00:35:51	00:35:53	She lost her nerve.
506	00:35:54	00:35:57	I told Josh that I couldn't leave Don.
507	00:35:59	00:36:01	That I...
508	00:36:01	00:36:05	That I still loved him despite his flaws.
509	00:36:07	00:36:09	That loser.
510	00:36:09	00:36:11	He was taking her down with him.
511	00:36:13	00:36:15	I realized there was only one way to save her.
512	00:36:17	00:36:19	So I built the detonator.
513	00:36:21	00:36:24	And after I took her to work, I took care of the problem.
514	00:36:24	00:36:29	Told Don there was a problem with the gas line in the garage.
515	00:36:35	00:36:37	Check out the pilot light.
516	00:36:55	00:36:57	He was holding her hostage.
517	00:37:01	00:37:03	And I set her free.
518	00:37:08	00:37:12	Brass just closed your arson-murder.
519	00:37:12	00:37:13	Contractor confessed.
520	00:37:13	00:37:15	Nice work.
521	00:37:15	00:37:17	Thanks.
522	00:37:17	00:37:19	I thought that this one was closed, too.
523	00:37:19	00:37:21	It is.
524	00:37:21	00:37:24	Then why are you wasting the taxpayers' money?
525	00:37:26	00:37:28	I'm kidding. (wry laugh)
526	00:37:28	00:37:31	Um...
527	00:37:31	00:37:32	a rock... Mm-hmm.
528	00:37:33	00:37:34	...through a window.
529	00:37:34	00:37:38	Don't you think Diane Palento was a little too street smart to make that much noise breaking in?
530	00:37:40	00:37:43	The owner came home, said he...
531	00:37:44	00:37:45	discovered he had been robbed.
532	00:37:45	00:37:47	So why was his laptop still in the house?
533	00:37:47	00:37:49	Wouldn't that have been at work with him?
534	00:37:49	00:37:52	And look-- his watch.
535	00:37:52	00:37:55	Most guys take their watches off to shower, or to...
536	00:37:55	00:37:57	to swim, to, uh... Have sex.
537	00:37:57	00:37:59	Except his wife was out of town that weekend.
538	00:38:01	00:38:03	So, I checked his web history.
539	00:38:03	00:38:05	Take a look at this.
540	00:38:05	00:38:07	Diamond.
541	00:38:07	00:38:09	AKA Diane Palento.
542	00:38:09	00:38:11	Very classy.
543	00:38:11	00:38:19	The husband hires himself a hooker, and after, when he passes out or takes a shower, she rips him off.
544	00:38:19	00:38:25	He might be able to explain away the laptop and the watch, but not his wife's jewelry.
545	00:38:26	00:38:28	I think he decided to stage a...
546	00:38:28	00:38:30	fake break-in.
547	00:38:32	00:38:34	(rubbing hands together) Shall we go bust him now?
548	00:38:34	00:38:38	The only thing that we could get him for is filing a false report.
549	00:38:38	00:38:45	It's a misdemeanor, and the D.A. would never prosecute, so, you got to just return the property and call it a day.
550	00:38:45	00:38:47	A good day.
551	00:38:52	00:38:58	My grandfather gave this to my grandmother in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, in 1914.
552	00:38:58	00:39:00	Never thought that I'd see it again.
553	00:39:00	00:39:01	I can't thank you enough.
554	00:39:01	00:39:03	Tell him how you lost it.
555	00:39:03	00:39:06	What, does that matter?
556	00:39:06	00:39:07	Tell him.
557	00:39:07	00:39:09	That's not really necessary, ma'am. Would you...?
558	00:39:09	00:39:10	Can we please just go?
559	00:39:10	00:39:13	Don't you touch me, you diseased pervert.
560	00:39:13	00:39:15	Oh, come on, I made a mistake, honey.
561	00:39:15	00:39:20	A mistake? You brought a whore into our bedroom, and you had disgusting sex with her on my bed.
562	00:39:20	00:39:27	No, I did not have disgusting sex-- I told you-- I got drunk and passed out, because subconsciously, honey, I could not go through with it.
563	00:39:27	00:39:29	Well, subconsciously, I can't stay married to a degenerate sleazeball.
564	00:39:29	00:39:31	I've never done anything like this before.
565	00:39:31	00:39:32	I've never done anything like...
566	00:39:32	00:39:33	How can I even trust you?
567	00:39:33	00:39:35	Come on! I didn't even get to do anything.
568	00:39:35	00:39:37	Oh, so now you're disappointed you didn't get to foul our sheets...
569	00:39:48	00:39:57	Alex, listen, I know you feel as if you betrayed your mother, but believe me, it may be the best thing that ever happened to her.
570	00:39:59	00:40:02	Your mother's going to need your help.
571	00:40:02	00:40:05	You may be the only person that she'll listen to.
572	00:40:05	00:40:12	I know it's not a fair thing to ask of a 14-year-old kid, but you've got to be strong for her.
573	00:40:14	00:40:17	Try to get her to go to a rehab program.
574	00:40:17	00:40:20	I can get you a list of places, if you like.
575	00:40:45	00:40:47	You sure you're okay with this?
576	00:40:47	00:40:49	You can still change your mind.
577	00:40:49	00:40:51	No, you can't.
578	00:40:51	00:40:53	I said I'd kill for an office, and I meant it.
579	00:40:53	00:40:56	Even a shared one.
580	00:40:56	00:40:59	Wow. This is a very classy move, Nick.
581	00:40:59	00:41:01	Very classy.
582	00:41:01	00:41:03	Seriously.
583	00:41:03	00:41:05	Well, you're welcome.
584	00:41:05	00:41:07	There's good energy in here.
585	00:41:07	00:41:09	It'll be nice to share it.
586	00:41:14	00:41:17	This belongs here.
587	00:42:09	00:42:11	We're off the clock.
588	00:42:11	00:42:13	I know.
589	00:42:17	00:42:19	I'll see you tomorrow.
