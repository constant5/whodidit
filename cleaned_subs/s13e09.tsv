0	00:00:12	00:00:13	Boy, there's a lot of live ones tonight, huh?
1	00:00:13	00:00:15	I know. You're used to the dead ones.
2	00:00:15	00:00:17	Yeah, they're a lot easier to work with.
3	00:00:17	00:00:20	Thanks for coming out, helping us grunts in the Mobile Crime Unit.
4	00:00:20	00:00:21	You're welcome.
5	00:00:21	00:00:25	All the problems in the department lately-- it's, uh, been hard making cases stick, you know? Uh-huh.
6	00:00:25	00:00:26	Well, that's why I'm here.
7	00:00:26	00:00:29	You deal with the whack-jobs, and I'll do the evidence collecting.
8	00:00:29	00:00:33	I'd like to think I'm going to miss all this, but I ain't.
9	00:00:33	00:00:35	What do you mean? You're not quitting, are you, Crawford?
10	00:00:35	00:00:37	No, I'm, uh, looking at a promotion.
11	00:00:37	00:00:38	Really?
12	00:00:38	00:00:39	Yeah. Detective.
13	00:00:39	00:00:43	A lot of opportunities now, so I'm gonna trade in my uniform for a suit.
14	00:00:43	00:00:45	Well, congratulations, Detective.
15	00:00:45	00:00:47	Thank you.
16	00:00:47	00:00:50	Yeah, it's, uh... it's got a nice ring to it.
17	00:00:50	00:00:52	Yeah, it does.
18	00:00:56	00:00:59	Excuse me, miss.
19	00:00:59	00:01:02	Can we talk to you, please? I ain't doing nothing wrong, Officer.
20	00:01:02	00:01:03	Well, you're not doing anything right, either.
21	00:01:03	00:01:05	What's your name?
22	00:01:05	00:01:07	Chastity.
23	00:01:07	00:01:09	Can I see some I.D., please?
24	00:01:09	00:01:12	Lost it.
25	00:01:12	00:01:13	But you didn't lose your purse.
26	00:01:13	00:01:15	Mind if I take a look inside?
27	00:01:18	00:01:22	You got some cash, a wallet and some condoms.
28	00:01:22	00:01:23	Well, safety first.
29	00:01:23	00:01:26	No I.D. Debit card.
30	00:01:26	00:01:27	Wait a minute. You don't look like Keith Dobson.
31	00:01:27	00:01:29	Yeah, it's not mine.
32	00:01:29	00:01:32	Then what are you doing with it?
33	00:01:32	00:01:33	Have you been arrested before?
34	00:01:33	00:01:35	No. Never.
35	00:01:35	00:01:37	Here's the deal.
36	00:01:37	00:01:40	You start telling me the truth, and maybe you get to go home.
37	00:01:40	00:01:44	But if you keep lying to me, you're going to jail.
38	00:01:50	00:01:53	I've never had to patrol the streets like this.
39	00:01:53	00:01:54	I mean, not even when I was a CSI-1.
40	00:01:54	00:01:57	It is a little crazy.
41	00:01:57	00:01:58	Full moon tonight.
42	00:01:58	00:02:04	You know, not to discount the crazy, but no lunar effect on human behavior has ever been established.
43	00:02:04	00:02:06	What about horses?
44	00:02:07	00:02:09	Hey, Trigger.
45	00:02:09	00:02:11	Wake up.
46	00:02:11	00:02:13	Hello.
47	00:02:15	00:02:18	Well, this grass ain't hay.
48	00:02:18	00:02:21	Trigger just bought himself a night in the barn.
49	00:02:21	00:02:25	Control, 3-0-5-Charlie. Sergeant Weiss requesting transport van to our location.
50	00:02:31	00:02:33	Hey, boys.
51	00:02:35	00:02:37	What?
52	00:02:37	00:02:38	Adrian. Hey, man.
53	00:02:38	00:02:39	Hey. How are sales?
54	00:02:39	00:02:41	What did I say, last time, huh?
55	00:02:41	00:02:44	One more swing and miss-- that is strike three.
56	00:02:44	00:02:45	That's life.
57	00:02:46	00:02:48	What's your name, kid?
58	00:02:49	00:02:51	I know you're scared, all right?
59	00:02:51	00:02:54	Okay, here's the deal-- you work with me, maybe you go home tonight.
60	00:02:54	00:02:57	Just going to need you to come downtown and make a statement, okay?
61	00:02:57	00:02:59	We got a deal?
62	00:03:10	00:03:12	All units, 415-C.
63	00:03:12	00:03:14	Olympia Casino.
64	00:03:14	00:03:16	Suspect possibly armed.
65	00:03:16	00:03:18	What are you all afraid of?
66	00:03:18	00:03:22	Hey, hey, I want you all to meet my dad.
67	00:03:22	00:03:24	We got in a little fight.
68	00:03:24	00:03:26	But, you know, it's all good now.
69	00:03:26	00:03:27	What's going on?
70	00:03:27	00:03:28	Casino security called it in.
71	00:03:28	00:03:30	A guy just showed up swinging a head.
72	00:03:30	00:03:33	Right, Pops?
73	00:03:33	00:03:34	Doesn't look like he's armed.
74	00:03:34	00:03:36	What are you looking at?
75	00:03:36	00:03:38	No, just dangerous. Officer, we need to move these people back.
76	00:03:38	00:03:41	LVPD. I'm going to have to ask everyone to move back.
77	00:03:41	00:03:43	Hey, sir, calm down. Put the head on the ground.
78	00:03:43	00:03:44	Step away.
79	00:03:44	00:03:46	Keep your hands where I can see them.
80	00:03:46	00:03:49	The blood is on your hands, not mine!
81	00:03:49	00:03:50	I'm not doing anything wrong.
82	00:03:50	00:03:54	Hey, hey, sir! Hey, sir, there's another casino across the street. Hey, hey.
83	00:03:54	00:03:56	Dad, come back.
84	00:03:56	00:03:57	Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh.
85	00:03:57	00:03:59	Hey, uh, guys, the head is fake.
86	00:03:59	00:04:01	Please tell me you're getting this. This is awesome!
87	00:04:01	00:04:02	Hey. It's a stunt.
88	00:04:02	00:04:04	Yeah, that girl in the blue hoodie!
89	00:04:04	00:04:06	Grab her! Hey, get back here!
90	00:04:07	00:04:09	You, stop!
91	00:04:09	00:04:11	Vegas PD. Get over here!
92	00:04:11	00:04:14	Running was bad, but, dude, that hurts.
93	00:04:14	00:04:16	Hurt's just beginning. Joke's over, kid.
94	00:04:16	00:04:22	I think you're going to jail, dude. Only adds to my fame when my video goes viral. I'm gonna have more hits than that chick singing... All right, you know what?
95	00:04:22	00:04:23	That's enough of that. Shut up.
96	00:04:23	00:04:25	Come on, man.
97	00:04:25	00:04:26	It's not like anybody died.
98	00:04:26	00:04:27	Get over here.
99	00:04:29	00:04:32	You got something?
100	00:04:33	00:04:35	Looks like someone else got punked tonight.
101	00:04:39	00:04:41	But this is no joke.
102	00:05:17	00:05:19	Everybody out.
103	00:05:28	00:05:30	You got an I.D.
104	00:05:30	00:05:31	on our gunshot victim?
105	00:05:31	00:05:33	No. No, not yet. Wallet was missing.
106	00:05:33	00:05:35	What about vehicle registration?
107	00:05:35	00:05:40	Well, it's a rental, but the guy won't give up the name till he clears it with corporate, so we're getting a warrant.
108	00:05:40	00:05:42	Sara is processing the car right now.
109	00:05:42	00:05:44	Evidence says the shooter was in the backseat.
110	00:05:44	00:05:46	Sounds like a pop-and-rob.
111	00:05:46	00:05:53	Well, unfortunately, traffic cam footage was a bust, so in the meantime, I'll check in with the doc, see what he's got to say.
112	00:05:53	00:05:54	Good Lord.
113	00:05:54	00:05:58	Dude, I need my head back. I rented it for the weekend.
114	00:05:58	00:06:00	This guy does special effects for TV.
115	00:06:00	00:06:03	Very good, but very expensive.
116	00:06:03	00:06:05	Sir, I need to confirm-- is this your vehicle?
117	00:06:08	00:06:11	Feel like I'm back at the Hollywood Division.
118	00:06:11	00:06:13	Where exactly do you need me?
119	00:06:13	00:06:15	Booking. Ask for Chastity.
120	00:06:15	00:06:17	You'll know when you see her.
121	00:06:17	00:06:18	I'm on it.
122	00:06:21	00:06:24	Hey, hey, hey, Crawford, when do I get my phone call?!
123	00:06:24	00:06:26	Hey! Here's my statement.
124	00:06:26	00:06:29	About buying drugs off that dealer.
125	00:06:29	00:06:30	Can I go now, Officer?
126	00:06:30	00:06:31	You need to sign it.
127	00:06:31	00:06:34	Ah.
128	00:06:34	00:06:37	Here you go.
129	00:06:37	00:06:40	Bobby Reed.
130	00:06:40	00:06:42	Is your dad Dennis Reed?
131	00:06:42	00:06:43	City attorney?
132	00:06:43	00:06:46	Yeah. He's not going to be too happy.
133	00:06:46	00:06:48	Well, it could be worse.
134	00:06:48	00:06:50	Next time, I won't let you off so easy.
135	00:06:50	00:06:52	You understand?
136	00:06:52	00:06:55	Josh McClure, Florida license.
137	00:06:55	00:06:58	It's Joslyn.
138	00:06:58	00:07:00	Joslyn. You understand why you're here?
139	00:07:00	00:07:02	No.
140	00:07:02	00:07:03	No, I... I do not.
141	00:07:03	00:07:05	You took a swing at a cab driver.
142	00:07:05	00:07:07	He started it, and I wasn't just protecting myself.
143	00:07:07	00:07:09	I was protecting the life of my unborn child.
144	00:07:09	00:07:11	Have you been drinking tonight?
145	00:07:11	00:07:13	Have you taken anything?
146	00:07:13	00:07:16	I take offense. I'd never endanger the health of my baby.
147	00:07:16	00:07:18	How dare you! Oh, hey.
148	00:07:19	00:07:21	Hey, I need some help here!
149	00:07:21	00:07:22	Somebody get the chair!
150	00:07:22	00:07:24	Get your hands off of me!
151	00:07:24	00:07:25	Calm down!
152	00:07:25	00:07:27	Ma'am? Sir?
153	00:07:27	00:07:28	Sit down!
154	00:07:28	00:07:30	Sit back. Joslyn, calm down.
155	00:07:30	00:07:32	Joslyn, sit down.
156	00:07:32	00:07:35	This is a violation! I've been violated!
157	00:07:35	00:07:37	If my water breaks, it'll be on your head!
158	00:07:37	00:07:38	Oh, you hear me?!
159	00:07:38	00:07:42	Your head! Oh, no!
160	00:07:42	00:07:43	Take it easy.
161	00:07:43	00:07:44	Joslyn, take it easy.
162	00:07:44	00:07:47	$2,300 in cash, and a stolen debit card.
163	00:07:47	00:07:48	Pretty good night, huh?
164	00:07:48	00:07:54	I'm gonna need you to take off your clothes and all of your personal belongings.
165	00:07:54	00:07:55	Jewelry, everything.
166	00:08:04	00:08:07	I'm gonna need the ring, too.
167	00:08:08	00:08:10	You'll get it back.
168	00:08:26	00:08:28	Mayans were right. World's coming to an end next month.
169	00:08:28	00:08:30	We should all be so lucky.
170	00:08:30	00:08:31	Has Sheriff Liston talked to you?
171	00:08:31	00:08:33	Hmm? No. Why?
172	00:08:33	00:08:35	Well, I wanted to give you a heads-up.
173	00:08:35	00:08:37	When I got shot, the department gave me a medal.
174	00:08:37	00:08:40	Uh-oh. What does the sheriff want to give me?
175	00:08:40	00:08:42	Her job.
176	00:08:42	00:08:44	What? What are you talking about?
177	00:08:44	00:08:47	She's thinking of resigning, appointing you as her replacement.
178	00:08:47	00:08:48	Resigning? No, no, no.
179	00:08:48	00:08:50	That's the worst thing she could do right now.
180	00:08:50	00:08:53	And-and I'm the last person who should replace her.
181	00:08:53	00:08:55	You should consider it. Seriously.
182	00:08:55	00:08:56	For the sake of the department.
183	00:08:56	00:09:01	Look, Conrad, not everyone likes you, but everyone respects you.
184	00:09:01	00:09:03	And maybe more importantly, they trust you.
185	00:09:03	00:09:09	I'll admit, there was a time I would have jumped at the opportunity, but now...
186	00:09:09	00:09:12	I don't even know if I want to be doing this job anymore, Jim.
187	00:09:12	00:09:15	Captain, we need to talk.
188	00:09:18	00:09:21	How's your head, Mr. Pak?
189	00:09:21	00:09:22	It hurts.
190	00:09:22	00:09:24	Oh, but you should see the other guy.
191	00:09:24	00:09:26	Well, the other head.
192	00:09:26	00:09:28	Nice to see you still have a sense of humor.
193	00:09:28	00:09:29	Are you here on vacation?
194	00:09:29	00:09:31	Electronics convention.
195	00:09:31	00:09:33	Hospital wasn't on the itinerary.
196	00:09:33	00:09:35	Those are some nasty-looking hives on your hands.
197	00:09:35	00:09:37	Oh, I'm sure it's nothing.
198	00:09:37	00:09:41	Shellfish, allergy to cigarette smoke, maybe.
199	00:09:41	00:09:44	Surprised it's still legal to smoke in casinos.
200	00:09:44	00:09:46	You can get away with a lot in this town.
201	00:09:46	00:09:47	Yeah, like assault with a fake bloody head.
202	00:09:51	00:09:52	Head was fake.
203	00:09:52	00:09:54	Blood's another story.
204	00:09:54	00:09:55	The blood was... real?
205	00:09:55	00:09:58	Could you give me a minute?
206	00:10:01	00:10:05	Hey, Greg, are you still talking to our prankster?
207	00:10:05	00:10:07	Yeah, I'm sitting right across from him. Why?
208	00:10:07	00:10:12	Hematrace on the blood from his fake head says that it's real, nonhuman.
209	00:10:12	00:10:14	I need to know what it is.
210	00:10:14	00:10:18	Hold on. Blood from your prop head's positive for nonhuman.
211	00:10:18	00:10:20	Nonhuman?
212	00:10:20	00:10:22	You make it sound like I used alien blood.
213	00:10:22	00:10:24	It's pig's blood. Old-school horror movie, dude.
214	00:10:24	00:10:26	Like any zombie movie.
215	00:10:26	00:10:28	Tarantino here says it's pig's blood.
216	00:10:28	00:10:30	Ugh. That's what I was afraid of.
217	00:10:30	00:10:32	The guy he clocked is having a reaction.
218	00:10:32	00:10:35	Could be viral. Maybe a blood-born pathogen.
219	00:10:35	00:10:40	Yeah, we need to know exactly where he went on the Strip and how many people he came in contact with.
220	00:10:40	00:10:42	Got it.
221	00:10:42	00:10:44	Well, it looks like your wish might have come true.
222	00:10:44	00:10:46	You went viral.
223	00:10:46	00:10:48	Awesome!
224	00:10:48	00:10:50	(whoops) As in outbreak.
225	00:10:50	00:10:53	Your pig's blood may have been tainted.
226	00:10:53	00:10:54	What are you talking about, dude?
227	00:10:54	00:10:55	I'm feeling fine.
228	00:10:55	00:10:58	All right, dude, you are going to draw me a map.
229	00:10:58	00:10:59	Everywhere you went.
230	00:10:59	00:11:01	And you had better find your girlfriend with the camera.
231	00:11:01	00:11:05	I'm gonna go find you another shirt so you don't contaminate anyone else.
232	00:11:05	00:11:08	You stay here, don't touch anything.
233	00:11:10	00:11:13	Your gunshot victim's stippling indicates close range.
234	00:11:13	00:11:15	Dead center, back of the head.
235	00:11:15	00:11:17	Victim never even turned around.
236	00:11:17	00:11:20	Tells me the shooter was quick and efficient, a professional.
237	00:11:20	00:11:23	Or the shooter was someone that the victim knew.
238	00:11:23	00:11:25	Or thought he knew.
239	00:11:25	00:11:27	Doc pulled a .22-caliber slug out of his head.
240	00:11:27	00:11:29	Come take a look at this.
241	00:11:32	00:11:33	There's no rifling.
242	00:11:33	00:11:35	Hmm, weird, right?
243	00:11:35	00:11:40	Yeah, usually see this when someone drills out the barrel of a gun to make it harder to identify.
244	00:11:40	00:11:45	Yeah, but that kind of modification would still leaves marks on the bullet as it rattled down the barrel.
245	00:11:45	00:11:49	Yeah, there's no sign of that on this bullet. No.
246	00:11:49	00:11:54	So...I'm thinking the shooter used a sub-caliber device.
247	00:11:54	00:12:02	Adapting a larger caliber weapon to fire a smaller caliber bullet, like using a .44 to fire a .22.
248	00:12:03	00:12:08	I'll get it to Hodges, see if he can identify trace from a sub-caliber device.
249	00:12:08	00:12:10	Maybe we'll be able to tie the bullet to the murder weapon.
250	00:12:10	00:12:13	Got to find the gun first.
251	00:12:13	00:12:15	Stop pushing me, I said.
252	00:12:15	00:12:18	Sit down.
253	00:12:18	00:12:20	I ran your prints, Chastity.
254	00:12:20	00:12:21	Your real name is Heather Tile, you're 19.
255	00:12:21	00:12:24	You're from Butler, Pennsylvania.
256	00:12:24	00:12:28	You have prior arrests in Los Angeles and Nevada for prostitution and larceny.
257	00:12:28	00:12:30	Look, I can explain that debit card.
258	00:12:30	00:12:31	I asked a friend... Forget about the debit card.
259	00:12:31	00:12:32	We'll talk about that later.
260	00:12:34	00:12:37	Now, here's what I want to ask you.
261	00:12:38	00:12:41	Where'd you get this ring?
262	00:12:41	00:12:44	What do you mean, where I got that ring?
263	00:12:44	00:12:45	That's mine.
264	00:12:45	00:12:46	No, it's not yours.
265	00:12:46	00:12:48	It is mine. No, it's not.
266	00:12:48	00:12:50	You know how I know?
267	00:12:50	00:12:52	The inscription.
268	00:12:52	00:12:56	See, I had that ring made for my ex-wife.
269	00:12:56	00:12:57	That's her engagement ring.
270	00:12:57	00:13:00	So I'm going to ask you again, where'd you get the ring?
271	00:13:00	00:13:04	I already told you, I bought it for, like, 200 bucks.
272	00:13:04	00:13:06	From who?
273	00:13:06	00:13:09	This girl-- we worked the streets together.
274	00:13:09	00:13:10	What's her name? I don't know.
275	00:13:10	00:13:12	We call her Jersey on the street.
276	00:13:14	00:13:17	Let me show you something.
277	00:13:17	00:13:18	Tell me...
278	00:13:20	00:13:21	...does that look like her?
279	00:13:21	00:13:24	Mm-hmm, yeah.
280	00:13:24	00:13:26	That's the girl.
281	00:13:29	00:13:31	Oh, man. That's my daughter.
282	00:13:34	00:13:36	It's coming.
283	00:13:36	00:13:38	It's coming, it's coming.
284	00:13:38	00:13:39	My baby is coming.
285	00:13:39	00:13:41	Oh, my water broke.
286	00:13:41	00:13:50	Oh, I'm out of time. Joslyn, remember, we agreed, if I let you out of the chair, you were going to cooperate and be calm. Please, I'm bursting.
287	00:13:50	00:13:52	Joslyn, please, we are trying to help you.
288	00:13:52	00:13:55	The paramedics are here. They just want to take you to the hospital, make sure you're okay.
289	00:13:55	00:13:58	Yeah, to make sure your baby is okay.
290	00:13:58	00:14:00	My baby is coming. I'm not going to any hospital.
291	00:14:00	00:14:02	I'm having my baby here!
292	00:14:02	00:14:05	I'm having my baby now. Joslyn, just calm down.
293	00:14:12	00:14:14	Get her down. Get her down!
294	00:14:14	00:14:15	Get her down!
295	00:14:23	00:14:25	Help me, help me with my baby.
296	00:14:30	00:14:32	Looks like a war zone.
297	00:14:32	00:14:34	Yeah, war at home.
298	00:14:34	00:14:35	One casualty.
299	00:14:35	00:14:40	Hospital said our pregnant transvestite was DOA.
300	00:14:40	00:14:43	Internal Affairs is going to be all over that.
301	00:14:43	00:14:44	Sergeant Weiss follow procedure?
302	00:14:44	00:14:46	As far as I know.
303	00:14:46	00:14:48	Doesn't mean they won't be looking for a scapegoat.
304	00:14:50	00:14:52	Quite a busy night on the Strip, Marko.
305	00:14:52	00:14:55	So where did you go after the Fashion Arcade?
306	00:14:55	00:14:57	Uh, I went to the Olympia.
307	00:14:57	00:14:59	Oh, hey, Lydia, it's me.
308	00:14:59	00:15:01	So, I'm here with the cops.
309	00:15:01	00:15:06	They think maybe our pig's blood spread some, like, Ebola or flu or something.
310	00:15:06	00:15:09	Anyway, I need the camera 'cause they want to see who we messed with, so call me back.
311	00:15:09	00:15:12	Like, right away.
312	00:15:14	00:15:18	Hey, Finn, if you're still at the hospital, I hope you're in quarantine because you do not want to be here.
313	00:15:18	00:15:20	I'm actually not in quarantine.
314	00:15:20	00:15:28	The hospital tested the pig's blood, and there is no sign of any virus or pathogen, and Mr. Pak's responded well to treatment, so he's on his way home.
315	00:15:28	00:15:29	So outbreak averted.
316	00:15:29	00:15:30	Yes.
317	00:15:30	00:15:32	I am headed back to the lab. Yeah.
318	00:15:32	00:15:33	I'll see you soon.
319	00:15:33	00:15:34	All right, bye.
320	00:15:34	00:15:36	Told you everything was cool.
321	00:15:36	00:15:38	Everything is not cool.
322	00:15:38	00:15:39	What is this?
323	00:15:39	00:15:43	This is a map of our prankster's trip down the Strip.
324	00:15:43	00:15:45	Passing right by our John Doe homicide.
325	00:15:45	00:15:46	Dude, I didn't see anything.
326	00:15:46	00:15:48	What about your girlfriend with the camera?
327	00:15:48	00:15:49	She was too busy shooting.
328	00:15:49	00:15:51	Video.
329	00:15:51	00:15:52	So maybe the camera is our witness.
330	00:15:52	00:15:54	Yeah, where is it?
331	00:15:54	00:15:55	Lydia has it. She's not calling me back.
332	00:15:55	00:16:01	Well, you'd better make up with her soon because that camera is evidence in a homicide investigation now.
333	00:16:03	00:16:04	Hey.
334	00:16:04	00:16:09	So I ran the stolen debit card that we got off of Chastity, and guess what.
335	00:16:09	00:16:13	It was used to rent the car that Nick found our gunshot victim in.
336	00:16:13	00:16:15	Did you get the driver's license? Yep.
337	00:16:15	00:16:16	Keith Dobson.
338	00:16:16	00:16:20	Name matches the one on the debit card, and the photo matches our dead guy.
339	00:16:20	00:16:24	So Keith Dobson is our John Doe...
340	00:16:24	00:16:26	and Chastity is upgraded from trick roll to murder.
341	00:16:26	00:16:29	Sara says the prankster may have footage of the crime.
342	00:16:29	00:16:34	Now we may have a suspect, although I'm not so sure she did it all on her own.
343	00:16:34	00:16:36	Maybe she had a partner.
344	00:16:45	00:16:46	Hey. Hey.
345	00:16:46	00:16:53	Um, what you said before about not wanting to do this anymore-- did you mean that?
346	00:16:53	00:16:55	I'm sorry you overheard that.
347	00:16:55	00:16:58	I don't know what I'm thinking right now, and right now is not a good time to discuss it.
348	00:16:58	00:16:59	Okay?
349	00:16:59	00:17:04	Okay, but, you know, whenever you're ready, you know where you can find me.
350	00:17:04	00:17:07	Okay.
351	00:17:07	00:17:13	I really did buy that ring, you know, and I'm willing to return it as long as you cut me a deal on that debit card.
352	00:17:15	00:17:17	So you want to negotiate?
353	00:17:17	00:17:19	Okay, let's negotiate.
354	00:17:19	00:17:22	You know who this is, right?
355	00:17:22	00:17:24	That's good.
356	00:17:24	00:17:31	Now, I want you to take your time because the next answer you give is going to decide whether you spend 25 years to life in prison.
357	00:17:34	00:17:36	I don't know nothing about that, man.
358	00:17:36	00:17:38	Okay, what do you know?
359	00:17:38	00:17:41	I met him at the pool at the Tangiers.
360	00:17:41	00:17:44	Him and his buddy-- they...they wanted company.
361	00:17:44	00:17:46	And you--who did you go with?
362	00:17:46	00:17:48	No one--it was just me.
363	00:17:48	00:17:50	They didn't seem to mind.
364	00:17:50	00:17:52	What? Don't give me that look.
365	00:17:52	00:17:54	I'm telling you the truth, all right?
366	00:17:54	00:17:55	We'll see.
367	00:17:55	00:17:56	How'd you get that debit card?
368	00:17:56	00:18:01	I spent the day with them at their suite, showed them a good time, you know.
369	00:18:01	00:18:05	The debit card guy was clueless.
370	00:18:05	00:18:07	The other guy was more of a player.
371	00:18:07	00:18:08	Seemed like a local.
372	00:18:08	00:18:13	Kind of like that cartoon, you know, like the Country Mouse, the City Mouse, I don't know.
373	00:18:14	00:18:18	Except, in this cartoon, the Country Mouse gets a bullet in the back of his head.
374	00:18:19	00:18:23	Look, I-I stole the card from the guy while he was in the shower.
375	00:18:23	00:18:28	Then he and his buddy-- they wanted to hit the Strip, so I left them at the valet stand.
376	00:18:28	00:18:30	I'm telling you the truth, I swear.
377	00:18:30	00:18:33	The dead guy's friend-- what did he look like?
378	00:18:33	00:18:38	Not much different-- just another college boy getting off on the Strip.
379	00:18:42	00:18:47	Subject is a male Caucasian, 27.
380	00:18:47	00:18:54	Cause of death is exsanguination due to multiple sharp force injuries severing the external iliac artery.
381	00:18:55	00:18:57	Greg, you okay?
382	00:18:57	00:19:00	Yeah, I...I just thought he was high.
383	00:19:00	00:19:02	I never imagined he would do anything like this.
384	00:19:02	00:19:05	We all have our own demons.
385	00:19:05	00:19:08	Drugs only weaken our ability to confront them.
386	00:19:08	00:19:13	Whatever delusions he was suffering from, clearly they got the best of him.
387	00:19:13	00:19:16	He may not have been as delusional as you think.
388	00:19:16	00:19:17	What do you mean?
389	00:19:17	00:19:27	According to the abdominal X-rays, Joslyn was pregnant-- not with a baby, but, uh, definitely with bundles of joy.
390	00:19:33	00:19:36	He was smuggling drugs.
391	00:19:36	00:19:40	And like him, not all the product survived.
392	00:19:40	00:19:42	No wonder he had a psychotic break.
393	00:19:42	00:19:44	Wanted to cut the baby out.
394	00:19:44	00:19:47	There must be at least 20 balloons left inside his stomach.
395	00:19:47	00:19:48	I'll get them to Tox.
396	00:19:48	00:19:52	If we can identify this drug, maybe we can figure out who he was muling for.
397	00:19:52	00:19:55	They did this to him.
398	00:19:55	00:19:58	I put our bullet under electron microscope magnification.
399	00:19:58	00:20:02	Well, whatever it is, it looks like it's scorched right onto the bullet.
400	00:20:02	00:20:07	It is, and if you take a closer look, you can see the face of Jesus.
401	00:20:07	00:20:08	Come on, man, it's been a long night, dude.
402	00:20:08	00:20:11	Fine, be a secular humanist.
403	00:20:11	00:20:16	What you're looking at is a composite material-- unpolymerized resin and calcium carbide.
404	00:20:16	00:20:19	Trace left by a sub-caliber device?
405	00:20:19	00:20:25	Could be, except that sub-caliber devices are made of brass or steel, not polymer.
406	00:20:25	00:20:27	Well, maybe the killer is using plastics.
407	00:20:27	00:20:29	Maybe even an entirely plastic gun.
408	00:20:29	00:20:31	Think about it.
409	00:20:31	00:20:35	Virtually undetectable, perfect for a robber working the Strip.
410	00:20:35	00:20:38	John Malkovich-- In the Line of Fire-- made a gun entirely out of polymer.
411	00:20:38	00:20:41	Good movie, bad science.
412	00:20:41	00:20:44	A polymer gun can't stand up to the pressure of firing a bullet.
413	00:20:44	00:20:45	It would break down.
414	00:20:45	00:20:47	Okay, what if you only needed to fire it once?
415	00:20:47	00:20:49	One shot, one kill.
416	00:20:49	00:20:50	Is that another movie?
417	00:20:50	00:20:53	It will be, starring my theory, coming to a lab near you.
418	00:20:53	00:20:56	Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.
419	00:20:56	00:20:59	Who would play you?
420	00:21:01	00:21:03	Hmm.
421	00:21:04	00:21:09	Hey, Greg, I ran those balloons Doc pulled off your pregnant transvestite.
422	00:21:09	00:21:10	Yeah.
423	00:21:10	00:21:13	Drugs were a cocktail of oxycodone, fentanyl and meperidine.
424	00:21:13	00:21:17	That's prescription, not your typical drug-mule fare.
425	00:21:17	00:21:19	No, but already on the menu tonight.
426	00:21:19	00:21:20	What do you mean?
427	00:21:20	00:21:24	A few hours ago, Nick and Officer Crawford busted a dealer on the Strip-- Adrian Dinan.
428	00:21:24	00:21:26	They took a baggie of powder off him.
429	00:21:26	00:21:31	The drugs the dealer was selling have a chemical composition identical to the drugs in your victim's stomach.
430	00:21:31	00:21:32	Same drugs.
431	00:21:32	00:21:38	Means Joslyn was smuggling for the same scumbag who has Dinan out there selling on the street.
432	00:21:38	00:21:39	Looks like it.
433	00:21:39	00:21:40	Thanks, Henry.
434	00:21:40	00:21:41	You found the connection I was looking for.
435	00:21:44	00:21:47	These are some nasty photos.
436	00:21:47	00:21:50	Nasty business, smuggling drugs for you and your boss.
437	00:21:50	00:21:55	We know who you work for, Adrian-- Rolan Zahl, Mad-10's set leader.
438	00:21:55	00:21:58	He runs girls and drugs along the Strip.
439	00:21:58	00:22:01	Sorry, I'm an independent contractor.
440	00:22:01	00:22:03	You want to stick to that story?
441	00:22:03	00:22:07	'Cause the drugs you're selling tie you to this.
442	00:22:07	00:22:09	Felony homicide.
443	00:22:09	00:22:10	Forget about three strikes.
444	00:22:10	00:22:14	I mean, we go for special circs, you get the needle.
445	00:22:14	00:22:19	I know you like to make deals, Crawford, but it's my turn.
446	00:22:19	00:22:21	What the hell are you talking about?
447	00:22:21	00:22:24	Crawford here collared the wrong drug dealer.
448	00:22:24	00:22:26	That's BS. Adrian, I caught you selling.
449	00:22:26	00:22:28	Not selling; sampling.
450	00:22:28	00:22:31	The white boy that he let go...
451	00:22:33	00:22:35	His name is Bobby Reed. He's a rich kid.
452	00:22:35	00:22:38	His daddy's some big shot lawyer for the city.
453	00:22:38	00:22:41	He's been moving drugs in clubs on the Strip.
454	00:22:41	00:22:46	Good business plan because he and his friends don't look like drug dealers.
455	00:22:46	00:22:49	But there's only...one problem.
456	00:22:49	00:22:50	Zahl.
457	00:22:50	00:22:52	And I imagine he doesn't like people...
458	00:22:52	00:22:54	cutting into his profits.
459	00:22:54	00:22:56	Which is where the sampling comes in.
460	00:22:56	00:22:58	Bobby approached me with his product.
461	00:22:58	00:23:02	Wanted to set up a meeting with Zahl.
462	00:23:02	00:23:07	Thought that going into business together was preferable to the alternative.
463	00:23:07	00:23:09	Let's say we believe you.
464	00:23:09	00:23:11	Where do we find Bobby Reed?
465	00:23:13	00:23:18	You want me to help you with your case, you need to help me with mine.
466	00:23:20	00:23:28	Hey, babe. Finally. I've been leaving messages for you all night. I thought we agreed, when you freeze me out like this, it's not healthy for our relationship... Marko, Marko, that's not helpful. Right.
467	00:23:28	00:23:30	Listen, I need to put you on speaker.
468	00:23:30	00:23:31	Do not put me on speaker.
469	00:23:31	00:23:33	Too late.
470	00:23:33	00:23:35	Sorry. Listen, I'm here with Detective Siegel.
471	00:23:35	00:23:37	The cops really need the camera, okay?
472	00:23:37	00:23:39	Don't hang up!
473	00:23:39	00:23:43	Uh, Ms. Kasper... It's-it's Lydia, right?
474	00:23:44	00:23:45	Who's this?
475	00:23:45	00:23:46	Uh, I'm Sara Sidle.
476	00:23:46	00:23:58	Uh, I'm with the crime lab, and I'm sure that you don't want anything to do with this, but in all honesty, a man was murdered tonight, and your camera may be the key to finding out who did it.
477	00:23:58	00:24:00	We really need your help.
478	00:24:00	00:24:02	You're right. I don't want anything to do with this.
479	00:24:02	00:24:03	Okay, w-well, you don't have to.
480	00:24:03	00:24:07	Uh, all I need you to do is drop the camera someplace where I could find it.
481	00:24:07	00:24:11	Could you... do that for me, please?
482	00:24:11	00:24:19	Where? Okay, uh, behind the Olympia Casino, there's an alley with a Dumpster for newspaper recycling.
483	00:24:19	00:24:21	You can dump it in there.
484	00:24:21	00:24:23	Okay. Marko, you still there?
485	00:24:23	00:24:24	Yeah, babe, I'm here.
486	00:24:24	00:24:27	I'm dumping you, too. (beep)
487	00:24:33	00:24:36	All right, ladies, I'm going to ask you to step over here.
488	00:24:36	00:24:38	Hey. You find anything yet?
489	00:24:38	00:24:40	No, nothing.
490	00:24:40	00:24:42	I swear, why do I trust people?
491	00:24:42	00:24:44	This job should've beat it out of us by now.
492	00:24:47	00:24:49	Wait.
493	00:24:49	00:24:54	Sometimes life does offer up a surprise.
494	00:24:55	00:24:57	M.P. Marko Palmisano.
495	00:24:57	00:24:59	All right.
496	00:25:05	00:25:07	Got blood drops.
497	00:25:07	00:25:09	What? And some drag marks.
498	00:25:12	00:25:14	Looks like a struggle.
499	00:25:18	00:25:19	Blue hoodie.
500	00:25:19	00:25:21	Oh, my God, it's Lydia.
501	00:25:25	00:25:27	Killer must've been looking for this camera, too.
502	00:25:28	00:25:30	Instead of finding it, found her.
503	00:25:36	00:25:38	This is my fault.
504	00:25:38	00:25:41	Whoever did this to Lydia did this because of me.
505	00:25:41	00:25:44	Marko, this is not your fault. It's not.
506	00:25:44	00:25:47	It's because of the camera.
507	00:25:47	00:25:51	I'm so sorry this happened, and I promise you that we'll find the person that did this.
508	00:25:54	00:25:56	I'm sorry.
509	00:26:09	00:26:11	Got to feel for the guy.
510	00:26:11	00:26:12	Hope he can forgive himself.
511	00:26:13	00:26:15	I recovered this from your victim.
512	00:26:16	00:26:18	Looks like a .22.
513	00:26:18	00:26:23	Same caliber as the bullet that killed our gunshot vic in the car, Keith Dobson.
514	00:26:23	00:26:27	Identical wound-- single round perfectly placed at the base of the skull.
515	00:26:27	00:26:30	Same caliber, same M.O., same killer.
516	00:26:30	00:26:36	Hey! I want you all to meet my dad!
517	00:26:36	00:26:37	So, did you find anything on the video?
518	00:26:37	00:26:40	I did. I found our crime scene.
519	00:26:40	00:26:43	Keith Dobson's rental car, and he has company.
520	00:26:43	00:26:45	Yeah, hold it right there.
521	00:26:46	00:26:47	Chastity.
522	00:26:47	00:26:51	It's a hooker we busted on the Strip, had Keith Dobson's debit card.
523	00:26:51	00:26:57	Well, she told Brass that she left Dobson and a buddy at the valet stand at the Tangiers.
524	00:26:57	00:26:59	Hard to believe that a hooker would lie.
525	00:26:59	00:27:02	Yeah. So what about this buddy?
526	00:27:02	00:27:03	Caught him on tape.
527	00:27:03	00:27:07	Ah, there he is-- in the backseat, right behind Keith Dobson.
528	00:27:07	00:27:13	Bobby Reed. That's the kid we let go--we thought he was buying drugs, dealer said he was selling.
529	00:27:13	00:27:16	Well, I think he may be guilty of more than that.
530	00:27:16	00:27:18	Sadly, we don't have the smoking gun on tape.
531	00:27:18	00:27:21	Thanks to Mini-Me in the Mini.
532	00:27:21	00:27:23	There's a bit of a jumble here.
533	00:27:23	00:27:26	There... it is.
534	00:27:26	00:27:29	Bobby Reed and Chastity high-tailing it away from the car.
535	00:27:29	00:27:31	Leaving Keith at the wheel.
536	00:27:31	00:27:32	Yeah, not moving.
537	00:27:32	00:27:34	Just like you found him.
538	00:27:34	00:27:36	It's not what it looks like.
539	00:27:36	00:27:41	Well, what is it, then? You know, I'm trying to be a good guy, you know, but all I get from you is lies.
540	00:27:41	00:27:47	You're gonna tell me the truth, or I'm throwing you to the wolves, so you got about five seconds to tell me.
541	00:27:47	00:27:48	I am telling you the truth, okay?
542	00:27:48	00:27:50	I had nothing to do with that murder.
543	00:27:50	00:27:54	I met them for the first time at the Tangiers. Okay, we're done here.
544	00:27:55	00:27:57	On orders from Rolan Zahl.
545	00:27:59	00:28:01	Rolan Zahl?
546	00:28:01	00:28:03	The Mad-10's set leader?
547	00:28:03	00:28:04	Huh?
548	00:28:04	00:28:07	Yeah. I work for him. You mean he's your pimp.
549	00:28:07	00:28:11	He asked me to pick up on Bobby Reed, so I did.
550	00:28:11	00:28:13	His buddy just came along for the ride.
551	00:28:13	00:28:15	He told me to...
552	00:28:15	00:28:18	hang out with Bobby and text him, let him know where we were.
553	00:28:18	00:28:20	So Rolan Zahl had you keeping tabs on Bobby Reed?
554	00:28:20	00:28:23	He said he just wanted to talk to the guy.
555	00:28:23	00:28:27	Talk? Yeah, talk, like, with a gun to his head. Look, what I don't understand is...
556	00:28:27	00:28:39	So, Bobby Reed is in Rolan's sights, but Bobby's friend ends up dead, and you and Bobby Reed are seen walking away. No, no, it's not what it looks like. Look, Bobby said he saw some friend of his on the Strip and...
557	00:28:39	00:28:42	he wanted to go say hi to him, so he just took off.
558	00:28:42	00:28:50	And me, I mean, I just wanted to get the hell out of there, you know? I couldn't tell any... When we walked away from that car, his friend was alive.
559	00:28:50	00:28:52	And they looked a lot alike.
560	00:28:52	00:28:54	Maybe if Rolan really wanted to...
561	00:28:54	00:28:56	Come on. What are you saying?
562	00:28:56	00:28:58	You're saying that Rolan popped the wrong guy?
563	00:28:58	00:29:01	Forget it. I already said too much.
564	00:29:04	00:29:06	always know when to walk away.
565	00:29:08	00:29:10	Jersey taught me that.
566	00:29:11	00:29:13	You better not be lying to me.
567	00:29:13	00:29:15	I'm not.
568	00:29:15	00:29:17	And I didn't lie about that ring, either.
569	00:29:17	00:29:19	She really did sell it to me. Wait a minute.
570	00:29:19	00:29:20	The two of you met in L.A.?
571	00:29:20	00:29:23	No, I didn't meet her in L.A. I met her in Vegas.
572	00:29:24	00:29:26	Vegas?
573	00:29:26	00:29:27	When?
574	00:29:28	00:29:31	Couple months ago.
575	00:29:35	00:29:38	Didn't know she was here, huh?
576	00:29:41	00:29:50	The two bullets we pulled from our victims exhibited not just the same trace, but, as you will notice, identical residue patterns singed onto their surfaces.
577	00:29:50	00:29:52	So what? Fired from the same gun, right?
578	00:29:52	00:29:54	Yes and no.
579	00:29:54	00:29:57	Heraclitus said, You never step into the same river twice.
580	00:29:57	00:30:04	Well, truthfully, you never fire the same gun twice, because each time you fire a weapon, you ever so slightly alter its characteristics.
581	00:30:04	00:30:06	Heraclitus, huh? Mmm.
582	00:30:06	00:30:08	Go on. All right.
583	00:30:08	00:30:10	Polymer trace got me thinking.
584	00:30:10	00:30:12	Maybe we're looking for a plastic gun.
585	00:30:12	00:30:13	Identical markings got me thinking further.
586	00:30:13	00:30:16	What if you were able to duplicate a gun?
587	00:30:16	00:30:19	One you could use once and then simply dispose of.
588	00:30:19	00:30:21	John Malkovich, In the Line of Fire.
589	00:30:21	00:30:24	I love you. Uh, I mean...respect.
590	00:30:24	00:30:26	Go on. Okay, I want to show you something.
591	00:30:29	00:30:31	(lilting music plays) 3-D printer?
592	00:30:31	00:30:32	The future is here.
593	00:30:32	00:30:44	They have scanners now that can scan an object to generate a perfect 3-D computer model, which is then fed into a 3-D printer, which then prints the object in three dimensions using layers of polymer.
594	00:30:44	00:30:45	Now, that's cool. Mm-hmm.
595	00:30:45	00:30:53	Primarily, 3-D printers are used to manufacture parts for antique cars and design prototypes. And you think our killer...
596	00:30:53	00:30:57	printed a gun. Multiple guns. Identical, disposable, untraceable.
597	00:30:57	00:30:59	Fits the M.O. of a pro.
598	00:30:59	00:31:01	How much do these cost?
599	00:31:01	00:31:03	They're not cheap-- around 150 K.
600	00:31:03	00:31:08	Okay, so they're not completely untraceable. Get on the phone, call the manufacturer, let's get a list going. Okay.
601	00:31:08	00:31:10	Mr. Reed, thank you for coming in.
602	00:31:10	00:31:12	I know, as city attorney, you're very busy and...
603	00:31:12	00:31:14	I can't believe this.
604	00:31:14	00:31:17	Do you recognize any of these faces with your son?
605	00:31:18	00:31:19	This young man is, um, Keith.
606	00:31:19	00:31:21	He's Bobby's college roommate.
607	00:31:21	00:31:23	This is Bobby's cousin, Josh, though I've...
608	00:31:23	00:31:26	never seen him dressed like that.
609	00:31:26	00:31:28	You say they're both dead?
610	00:31:28	00:31:30	Yes. Along with a young woman, a witness.
611	00:31:32	00:31:34	Bobby's mom and I split up when he was four.
612	00:31:34	00:31:36	She took him to live back east.
613	00:31:36	00:31:38	After college, he came to live out here.
614	00:31:38	00:31:40	He wanted to make it on his own.
615	00:31:40	00:31:42	Hospitality management.
616	00:31:42	00:31:46	Mostly it just seemed like he went to clubs. I...
617	00:31:46	00:31:49	I figured he's young. So you...
618	00:31:49	00:31:51	you really didn't know, uh, what he was into?
619	00:31:53	00:31:54	Do you have kids?
620	00:31:54	00:32:01	This isn't really about me, Mr. Reed. You know, Bobby has been playing drug lord, and he's pissed off the real one.
621	00:32:01	00:32:03	A vicious bastard named Rolan Zahl.
622	00:32:03	00:32:06	Now, we don't have enough evidence to bring Zahl in.
623	00:32:06	00:32:10	But with three people dead, and maybe Bobby next, we need your help.
624	00:32:10	00:32:11	What can I do?
625	00:32:11	00:32:13	Reach out to your son.
626	00:32:13	00:32:15	Tell him to come in and talk to us.
627	00:32:15	00:32:17	Help us bring a killer to justice.
628	00:32:17	00:32:20	And if I can't talk him into it?
629	00:32:20	00:32:22	Then he's looking at street justice.
630	00:32:22	00:32:23	And very soon.
631	00:32:23	00:32:25	I ran Chastity's phone records.
632	00:32:25	00:32:30	She was definitely texting with someone about where she and Bobby Reed were all night.
633	00:32:30	00:32:32	Texting Rolan Zahl?
634	00:32:32	00:32:34	I don't know. It was a burner cell.
635	00:32:34	00:32:36	20 p.m., Leaving the hotel with Bobby.
636	00:32:36	00:32:39	Burner cell responds, Stay with him.
637	00:32:39	00:32:43	10 Tell me where you end up.
638	00:32:43	00:32:45	50, Pulled over, Price and Boulevard.
639	00:32:45	00:32:48	Keep him there, don't let him leave.
640	00:32:48	00:32:50	It sounds to me like someone was closing in for the kill.
641	00:32:50	00:32:52	That's when Chastity got out of there.
642	00:32:52	00:32:55	And Bobby sees a guy on the Strip he wants to talk to.
643	00:32:55	00:32:57	Our dealer, Adrian Dinan.
644	00:32:57	00:33:00	And Bobby and Chastity take off, leaving Bobby's friend Keith behind.
645	00:33:00	00:33:05	Shooter slips into the backseat, pops the wrong guy.
646	00:33:05	00:33:08	You know, Bobby and Keith do look a lot alike.
647	00:33:08	00:33:09	That's a good theory.
648	00:33:09	00:33:10	But how do we prove it?
649	00:33:12	00:33:13	Anybody order a break in the case?
650	00:33:13	00:33:15	I hate it when you do that.
651	00:33:15	00:33:16	You're gonna like this.
652	00:33:16	00:33:23	Trace from our bullets-- unpolymerized resin and calcium carbide-- turns out to be a match to a 3-D printer model.
653	00:33:23	00:33:27	One that I believe printed our guns.
654	00:33:27	00:33:28	Could I see that trace report?
655	00:33:28	00:33:30	So you proved your plastic gun theory.
656	00:33:31	00:33:33	Congratulations.
657	00:33:33	00:33:35	How does that break our case?
658	00:33:35	00:33:41	Purchase of said printer tracks to a car restoration shop on Madison Street in Northtown.
659	00:33:42	00:33:44	one Rolan Zahl.
660	00:33:44	00:33:46	Oh, looks like we're closer to putting the murder weapon in Zahl's hand.
661	00:33:46	00:33:48	Not exactly Zahl's hand.
662	00:33:48	00:33:50	Unpolymerized resin and calcium carbide.
663	00:33:50	00:33:52	That is not the first time I've seen this trace.
664	00:33:52	00:33:54	What do you mean?
665	00:33:54	00:33:58	Same results came back from Desert Palm last night.
666	00:33:58	00:34:00	They were looking for biologicals.
667	00:34:00	00:34:01	A blood-borne pathogen.
668	00:34:01	00:34:06	The cause of an allergic reaction experienced by Mr. Anthony Pak.
669	00:34:06	00:34:07	Wait a minute.
670	00:34:07	00:34:11	Isn't that our tourist who was clocked by Mark Palmisano's latex head?
671	00:34:11	00:34:15	Who also had an allergic reaction, apparently, to his own gun.
672	00:34:15	00:34:17	Plastic guns aren't for everyone.
673	00:34:17	00:34:21	Context is everything, and everything is making a lot more sense right now.
674	00:34:21	00:34:22	Check it out.
675	00:34:22	00:34:25	Lydia's video footage.
676	00:34:25	00:34:28	He must have thought she recorded the murder.
677	00:34:28	00:34:29	It was no accident Pak was there.
678	00:34:29	00:34:32	No, man, he was going for the camera.
679	00:34:32	00:34:33	Our tourist is our killer.
680	00:34:48	00:34:52	So Dennis Reed convinced his son to turn himself in.
681	00:34:52	00:34:54	Well, the guy's the city attorney.
682	00:34:54	00:34:55	His whole life is about negotiation.
683	00:34:55	00:34:57	You know, unions, developers.
684	00:34:57	00:35:01	This was a negotiation I didn't think he could pull off.
685	00:35:01	00:35:05	I guess you can't underestimate the bond between a father and a child.
686	00:35:05	00:35:07	Hasn't been my experience.
687	00:35:07	00:35:09	Yeah, sorry.
688	00:35:09	00:35:11	I heard about the ring.
689	00:35:11	00:35:16	Well, you know, that might have been one of the best days of my life.
690	00:35:16	00:35:17	I surprised Nancy, my ex-wife.
691	00:35:17	00:35:20	I gave her the ring, took her to dinner, the ballet.
692	00:35:20	00:35:21	Yeah, yeah, ballet.
693	00:35:21	00:35:23	I like ballet. No, I can see that.
694	00:35:23	00:35:25	Yeah, there was a lot of good memories in the early years.
695	00:35:25	00:35:30	But I guess that's what you hang onto, the good times.
696	00:35:30	00:35:32	Even with my daughter Ellie.
697	00:35:32	00:35:33	I'm sorry.
698	00:35:33	00:35:34	That's got to be hard.
699	00:35:34	00:35:37	You know, when Nancy and I split up, she wanted to give the ring back.
700	00:35:37	00:35:38	I said, no, give it to Ellie.
701	00:35:38	00:35:40	She should have it.
702	00:35:40	00:35:42	And then she sells it to that girl for 200 bucks.
703	00:35:42	00:35:48	That only means that she's in trouble, and she's not reaching out to me.
704	00:35:52	00:35:54	You know that guy?
705	00:35:54	00:35:56	Never seen him before.
706	00:35:56	00:35:57	Well, he knows you.
707	00:35:57	00:35:59	Lucky for you, he doesn't know you that well.
708	00:35:59	00:36:02	That's why he popped your buddy Keith instead of you.
709	00:36:02	00:36:05	You really pissed off Rolan Zahl.
710	00:36:05	00:36:07	He hired a hit man to put you out of business.
711	00:36:07	00:36:09	I know that.
712	00:36:09	00:36:10	That's why I'm here, right?
713	00:36:10	00:36:12	I don't get it.
714	00:36:12	00:36:16	education, money, opportunity.
715	00:36:16	00:36:18	Why the hell would you want to be a drug dealer?
716	00:36:18	00:36:20	You sound like my dad.
717	00:36:20	00:36:23	These men are trying to help you, Bobby.
718	00:36:23	00:36:24	You should listen to your father.
719	00:36:24	00:36:26	I've listened plenty.
720	00:36:26	00:36:29	I don't want to be a lawyer or a doctor or a banker.
721	00:36:29	00:36:30	Might as well be dead.
722	00:36:32	00:36:34	I don't expect you people to understand.
723	00:36:34	00:36:37	What it's like to be a player.
724	00:36:37	00:36:38	Prince of the city.
725	00:36:38	00:36:41	You do realize that three people are dead because of you, right?
726	00:36:41	00:36:43	That's not on me.
727	00:36:43	00:36:45	Do you have any idea what you've done?
728	00:36:45	00:36:46	What the hell is wrong with you?
729	00:36:46	00:36:48	I know exactly what I've done, Dad.
730	00:36:48	00:36:50	And I know where I'm going.
731	00:36:50	00:36:52	Just like old times.
732	00:36:52	00:36:53	You get weekend visits.
733	00:36:53	00:36:57	And, hey, maybe if you show up more often this time, you'll figure me out.
734	00:36:59	00:37:02	Got something for me to sign, don't you?
735	00:37:02	00:37:04	We do.
736	00:37:06	00:37:08	Okay.
737	00:37:08	00:37:10	So the college boy's in; what about you?
738	00:37:10	00:37:12	Do I really have a choice?
739	00:37:12	00:37:15	Right now, you're just looking at solicitation.
740	00:37:15	00:37:21	I'd rather have your help trying to bring Rolan Zahl in than bumping up the charges to accessory to murder.
741	00:37:23	00:37:28	When this is all over... then what?
742	00:37:31	00:37:33	It's not like you guys are gonna protect me or anything.
743	00:37:33	00:37:35	Hey.
744	00:37:35	00:37:37	Heather.
745	00:37:37	00:37:39	Listen to me.
746	00:37:39	00:37:46	When this is over... I'm gonna give you money and a bus ticket back to Butler, PA.
747	00:37:46	00:37:51	I want you to go back home, I want you to call your dad, I want you to try to build a life there.
748	00:37:51	00:37:53	And don't come back to the Strip.
749	00:37:57	00:38:00	Chastity's made contact with Pak.
750	00:38:00	00:38:03	I hope she keeps him on the hook.
751	00:38:03	00:38:06	Looks like it's going down at the Fashion Arcade.
752	00:38:06	00:38:08	Fashion Arcade. You got that, Nick?
753	00:38:08	00:38:09	Yeah, copy that.
754	00:38:09	00:38:10	We got eyes on Bobby and Chastity.
755	00:38:10	00:38:13	Backup's en route.
756	00:38:13	00:38:15	Taking up positions.
757	00:38:15	00:38:18	I'm pulling up CCTV cams on the Strip.
758	00:38:19	00:38:23	I got Bobby Reed and Chastity.
759	00:38:23	00:38:25	There's Nick and Crawford.
760	00:38:25	00:38:27	Any sign of our shooter? Not yet.
761	00:38:27	00:38:29	Oh, wait a minute.
762	00:38:29	00:38:31	Got him.
763	00:38:31	00:38:32	Hello, Mr. Pak.
764	00:38:32	00:38:36	Nick, we have a visual on Pak. Where?
765	00:38:36	00:38:38	00.
766	00:38:40	00:38:45	Yeah, yeah, it... it looks like he's texting.
767	00:38:47	00:38:50	Yeah, he's telling them to go to the food court.
768	00:38:50	00:38:52	All units, converge on the food court.
769	00:38:52	00:38:54	All units, converge on the food court.
770	00:38:54	00:38:55	Pak's on the move.
771	00:38:55	00:38:57	That's all right, we got him.
772	00:39:01	00:39:04	He's taking a shortcut.
773	00:39:04	00:39:05	Where the hell did he go?
774	00:39:05	00:39:07	Nick, we lost him.
775	00:39:07	00:39:09	Yeah, so did we.
776	00:39:09	00:39:11	Where'd he go?
777	00:39:11	00:39:12	I don't know. I can't find him anywhere.
778	00:39:15	00:39:17	He knows where the cameras are.
779	00:39:31	00:39:34	LVPD.
780	00:39:34	00:39:35	Drop the gun.
781	00:39:35	00:39:38	Drop it or we drop you.
782	00:39:42	00:39:43	Looking good, Weiss.
783	00:39:50	00:39:52	Pak's not talking.
784	00:39:52	00:39:54	Not even to ask for a lawyer?
785	00:39:54	00:39:58	I'm sure Rolan Zahl has that all taken care of.
786	00:39:58	00:40:01	By the way, we searched Rolan Zahl's auto restoration shop.
787	00:40:01	00:40:03	No sign of a 3-D printer.
788	00:40:03	00:40:04	Got rid of it.
789	00:40:04	00:40:06	Okay, so what do we got?
790	00:40:06	00:40:09	We got a gun and a phone with text messages, both in Pak's hands.
791	00:40:09	00:40:13	And Rolan Zahl's hands stay clean.
792	00:40:13	00:40:16	We do have Chastity's testimony.
793	00:40:16	00:40:17	Uh, the word of a prostitute?
794	00:40:17	00:40:18	Good luck.
795	00:40:18	00:40:21	Okay, so Zahl walks, everybody else goes to jail.
796	00:40:23	00:40:25	And Chastity?
797	00:40:25	00:40:27	No, she's got a deal that stays in place.
798	00:40:27	00:40:29	She's getting a second chance.
799	00:40:29	00:40:31	She's a smart girl. I think she'll take it.
800	00:40:31	00:40:35	Little help from the right person, I'm sure she will.
801	00:40:52	00:40:53	Waitress was busy.
802	00:40:53	00:40:55	Thought I'd give her a hand.
803	00:40:55	00:40:56	Man, you are a tough guy to find.
804	00:40:56	00:40:59	I practically had to bribe your duty officer just to get your 20.
805	00:40:59	00:41:04	I just needed a little peace and quiet to finish up these reports for I.A.
806	00:41:04	00:41:09	Probably having a field day with the bloodbath in the PD and cops letting suspects walk.
807	00:41:09	00:41:12	Anybody getting the ax?
808	00:41:12	00:41:14	Not if I can help it.
809	00:41:19	00:41:21	Chicken soup?
810	00:41:21	00:41:22	You don't like that stuff.
811	00:41:22	00:41:25	Last time I saw you with a bowl of that, it was in the hospital.
812	00:41:25	00:41:28	Well, I'm developing a taste for it, I guess.
813	00:41:28	00:41:30	What's wrong, Dad?
814	00:41:32	00:41:34	Is this about the sheriff's offer?
815	00:41:34	00:41:38	I don't know, M. I-I guess I'm just not feeling myself lately.
816	00:41:38	00:41:44	These days, everywhere I look, everything in my life just seems so complicated.
817	00:41:45	00:41:46	Everything, huh?
818	00:41:46	00:41:48	Really?
819	00:41:48	00:41:51	No, no, I d--I don't mean everything, no.
820	00:41:51	00:42:02	Listen to me, I'm confused about a lot of things right now, but you and me, our relationship-- that is the only thing in my life that makes sense.
821	00:42:08	00:42:09	Well, my shift is over.
822	00:42:09	00:42:11	Mind if I join you?
823	00:42:11	00:42:14	I'd be happy to have your company--always.
824	00:42:14	00:42:18	Would it drive you crazy if I ordered a bacon double chili cheeseburger?
825	00:42:18	00:42:20	Not if we order two.
826	00:42:22	00:42:24	Hey.
827	00:42:24	00:42:25	I just got back from holding.
828	00:42:25	00:42:26	Where's Heather?
829	00:42:26	00:42:28	Who? Heather Tile.
830	00:42:29	00:42:32	Chastity the prostitute.
831	00:42:32	00:42:35	Oh, yeah, somebody made bail for her.
832	00:42:35	00:42:36	Bail--who?
833	00:42:36	00:42:37	I don't know.
834	00:42:37	00:42:41	You know, actually, she left something for you.
835	00:42:41	00:42:43	Oh.
