1	00:00:35	00:00:38	He loves his little sister.
2	00:00:38	00:00:39	Look at...
3	00:00:39	00:00:40	I love 'em.
4	00:00:40	00:00:42	Here you go, Miss Connie.
5	00:00:42	00:00:43	Oh, thank you. You're welcome.
6	00:00:43	00:00:45	Edie, did I show you these yet? Aw.
7	00:00:45	00:00:47	Look how precious.
8	00:00:47	00:00:49	I can't believe how big those grandbabies are getting. I know.
9	00:00:49	00:00:51	Hey, guys. Whenever you're ready, okay?
10	00:00:51	00:00:53	Thanks. Thanks, Edie.
11	00:00:53	00:00:57	Sheila, it's 4 Do we really have to fight about this now?
12	00:00:57	00:00:58	Looking good.
13	00:00:58	00:00:59	Not for you, young lady.
14	00:00:59	00:01:01	We've been married for three years.
15	00:01:01	00:01:04	You know me better than that. Strawberries.
16	00:01:04	00:01:12	I don't know what your secret is, but one of these days, you're gonna have to share it with my brother. Babe, why do we keep having the same conversation?
17	00:01:12	00:01:14	It's not going to change anything.
18	00:01:14	00:01:15	But it's not up to you.
19	00:01:15	00:01:19	This time it's up to me.
20	00:01:19	00:01:22	I don't know how you keep that figure drinking one of these every night.
21	00:01:22	00:01:24	Work it off on stage, honey. Trust me.
22	00:01:26	00:01:27	You should come see the show sometime.
23	00:01:27	00:01:30	Yeah.
24	00:01:40	00:01:43	00.
25	00:01:43	00:01:47	I'm-I'm staying a while longer.
26	00:01:47	00:01:49	Is that guy still bothering you?
27	00:01:49	00:01:51	Can't you two make him disappear?
28	00:01:51	00:01:56	Hey, I'll tell you what, we'll have a little talk with him on the way out. Thanks.
29	00:02:01	00:02:03	Looks like your problem disappeared, Edie.
30	00:02:03	00:02:04	3-David-11, respond to 308...
31	00:02:04	00:02:06	Control, 3-David-11, copy.
32	00:02:06	00:02:08	Bye, guys.
33	00:02:08	00:02:11	All right, see you, fellas.
34	00:02:11	00:02:13	I got to get more hash browns.
35	00:02:13	00:02:14	Okay.
36	00:02:38	00:02:41	Hey, you know what I'm talking about, though.
37	00:02:41	00:02:42	I'm talking about the dish with the tortillas and the...
38	00:02:42	00:02:44	Yeah, I know what you mean.
39	00:02:44	00:02:51	(sighs) I can't believe we've been coming here for the past 12 years and you've never had the chilaquiles.
40	00:02:51	00:02:52	I don't like chilaquiles.
41	00:02:52	00:02:54	Seriously? Have you had Vincent's? No.
42	00:02:54	00:02:55	Sara. Huh?
43	00:02:55	00:02:56	Help me out here.
44	00:02:56	00:02:58	You know, I'm not a fan either.
45	00:02:58	00:02:59	Really? Yeah... Hi.
46	00:02:59	00:03:01	Vincent call you guys, too?
47	00:03:01	00:03:03	No, we're just coming here to grab something to eat. Why?
48	00:03:03	00:03:05	Not sure. Vincent said he's stuck in the fridge.
49	00:03:05	00:03:07	Can't get his brother to answer his cell.
50	00:03:07	00:03:09	Maybe he's enjoying some chilly-killies.
51	00:03:09	00:03:12	No, no, its cheelay-keelays.
52	00:03:15	00:03:16	Oh, my God.
53	00:03:16	00:03:19	Control, 3-David-10.
54	00:03:19	00:03:21	Multiple 419s at Frank's Diner.
55	00:03:21	00:03:23	Owen's dead.
56	00:03:23	00:03:24	Yeah, so is Dahlia.
57	00:03:26	00:03:28	It's Edie.
58	00:03:28	00:03:29	We just left her.
59	00:03:32	00:03:35	Let's take the back.
60	00:03:35	00:03:36	Come on, let's go.
61	00:03:37	00:03:38	Clear.
62	00:03:38	00:03:40	Clear.
63	00:03:40	00:03:41	Freezer.
64	00:03:45	00:03:47	Whoa, whoa, whoa. J-Just me, guys.
65	00:03:47	00:03:48	Hey, Vincent, let's go out back.
66	00:03:48	00:03:50	Why? Wh-What's happening?
67	00:03:50	00:03:53	Go in there. Come on, come on.
68	00:03:53	00:03:54	Vincent, stop, Vincent, no.
69	00:03:54	00:03:56	No.
70	00:03:56	00:03:57	Vincent... No.
71	00:03:57	00:03:59	Come on, man.
72	00:03:59	00:04:01	There's blood on the floor here.
73	00:04:01	00:04:02	This can't be! I just...
74	00:04:02	00:04:04	Nick...
75	00:04:04	00:04:07	They're all dead.
76	00:04:47	00:04:49	What the hell happened?
77	00:04:49	00:04:51	You were here? We'd just left.
78	00:04:51	00:04:53	Captain, it was only a couple minutes. Register's cleaned out.
79	00:04:53	00:04:55	It looks like a robbery, maybe.
80	00:04:55	00:04:57	Maybe? Edie was having trouble with some guy, a stalker.
81	00:04:57	00:04:59	He was hanging around out front.
82	00:04:59	00:05:01	Well, did you do anything about it? Wish we had.
83	00:05:01	00:05:03	We were gonna go talk to him, but he was gone before we even got outside.
84	00:05:03	00:05:04	We know this guy, right?
85	00:05:04	00:05:06	Yeah. Yes.
86	00:05:06	00:05:08	So put a broadcast on! Get him here!
87	00:05:08	00:05:09	Yes, sir.
88	00:05:19	00:05:22	Oh, man.
89	00:05:22	00:05:26	You know, I-I been coming here probably 20 years.
90	00:05:26	00:05:29	Even had Thanksgiving dinner here when I first came to Vegas.
91	00:05:29	00:05:32	Shooter must've come in the front door.
92	00:05:32	00:05:34	I mean, the trouble started right there with Owen.
93	00:05:34	00:05:37	And you know Dahlia always sits at the counter.
94	00:05:37	00:05:38	Must've tried to jump in.
95	00:05:38	00:05:40	Once a marine, always a marine.
96	00:05:49	00:05:52	I always used to notice them when they came in here.
97	00:05:52	00:05:54	The way they looked at each other.
98	00:05:54	00:05:57	They seemed so... content.
99	00:05:57	00:06:00	Seemed to have marriage all figured out.
100	00:06:00	00:06:02	Look at that.
101	00:06:09	00:06:13	I know most of the faces in here.
102	00:06:13	00:06:15	Ever see these two guys before?
103	00:06:15	00:06:17	No, I haven't.
104	00:06:17	00:06:21	But Connie was always happy to see a fresh face so she could show off her grandkids.
105	00:06:22	00:06:24	All this carnage, you know.
106	00:06:24	00:06:26	I don't buy robbery.
107	00:06:27	00:06:30	Akers is putting a broadcast out on the stalker.
108	00:06:30	00:06:32	Ronald Basderic.
109	00:06:34	00:06:37	Been terrorizing Edie for six months.
110	00:06:37	00:06:39	Wasn't enough to kill her.
111	00:06:39	00:06:41	He wanted to destroy her whole world.
112	00:06:43	00:06:45	Gunshot to the head, up close and personal.
113	00:06:45	00:06:48	I tried to help her get a restraining order, but the judge denied it.
114	00:06:48	00:06:51	Basderic has been very careful.
115	00:06:51	00:06:54	He'd push right up to the line and never cross it.
116	00:06:54	00:06:57	Until now.
117	00:06:57	00:06:59	Shoe impression.
118	00:06:59	00:07:01	They don't match any of the shoes in here.
119	00:07:02	00:07:04	I got to take this.
120	00:07:06	00:07:08	Yeah, go ahead.
121	00:07:56	00:07:58	Whoa.
122	00:07:58	00:08:00	You step on my finger, I'll kill you.
123	00:08:00	00:08:02	Ten inches in front of your left foot.
124	00:08:02	00:08:03	Could you mark it?
125	00:08:07	00:08:08	Thanks.
126	00:08:10	00:08:15	Hey, guys, could I just have an hour to be alone so I can work the blood?
127	00:08:15	00:08:19	I was just going to check the walk-in.
128	00:08:19	00:08:20	Is there blood?
129	00:08:20	00:08:21	No.
130	00:08:21	00:08:22	Okay.
131	00:08:57	00:08:59	Hello?
132	00:09:26	00:09:27	Ah.
133	00:09:27	00:09:29	Hey, Finn.
134	00:09:29	00:09:31	I found something.
135	00:09:31	00:09:37	(laughs) Well, I'd... I'd love to, but, uh... you're gonna have to come to me.
136	00:09:37	00:09:39	This is so horrible.
137	00:09:39	00:09:42	I know it's been a long night, Vincent, but they still need to talk to you.
138	00:09:42	00:09:45	It's okay, Charlie, I'll take care of him.
139	00:09:45	00:09:47	Yeah. Hey, Vincent. Nick.
140	00:09:47	00:09:49	How could this happen? I don't know yet, man.
141	00:09:49	00:09:51	We're just getting started.
142	00:09:51	00:09:52	Now, do you have any other clothes?
143	00:09:52	00:09:57	'Cause the minute you stepped in blood, you became evidence, you know that, right? No, I-I understand.
144	00:09:57	00:10:00	How many times have I heard you guys talk about crime scenes?
145	00:10:00	00:10:02	No, no, that's okay, I'll get it.
146	00:10:02	00:10:03	I'll get it. Just relax.
147	00:10:08	00:10:11	Okay, turn around for me.
148	00:10:15	00:10:16	Vincent?
149	00:10:16	00:10:17	Oh, God.
150	00:10:17	00:10:19	That's Sheila, Owen's wife.
151	00:10:19	00:10:20	Vincent, they called me, but they're wrong.
152	00:10:20	00:10:22	It's not true, right?
153	00:10:22	00:10:23	He's okay! Please!
154	00:10:23	00:10:24	Tell me he's okay!
155	00:10:24	00:10:26	I'm so sorry.
156	00:10:26	00:10:28	No! Sheila.
157	00:10:28	00:10:29	No, no, Vincent.
158	00:10:29	00:10:30	Now, get back.
159	00:10:30	00:10:32	I can't let you do that.
160	00:10:32	00:10:34	Not until I've processed your clothes, okay?
161	00:10:34	00:10:35	Okay.
162	00:10:42	00:10:44	What's all the fuss?
163	00:10:44	00:10:46	You look okay to me.
164	00:10:46	00:10:48	And here I thought you weren't gonna come visit me.
165	00:10:48	00:10:50	You got in just under the wire, mister.
166	00:10:50	00:10:51	Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. No, that's...
167	00:10:51	00:10:55	Barbara and I had to take Maya and Katie back up to Seattle.
168	00:10:55	00:10:57	I took a little time off.
169	00:10:57	00:10:58	How you feeling?
170	00:10:58	00:11:01	You know...
171	00:11:02	00:11:04	Honestly, it hurts.
172	00:11:04	00:11:08	I wouldn't recommend getting shot.
173	00:11:08	00:11:12	Although it did get my daughter to tell me she loves me, so...
174	00:11:12	00:11:13	Can't be bad. Yeah.
175	00:11:13	00:11:16	How is your family?
176	00:11:16	00:11:18	Better.
177	00:11:18	00:11:19	Thank you.
178	00:11:19	00:11:21	Barbara's gonna stay there for a while.
179	00:11:21	00:11:24	Help them get settled in.
180	00:11:28	00:11:30	Damn it. Oh, come on.
181	00:11:34	00:11:36	There it is.
182	00:11:36	00:11:38	Thanks. Yeah.
183	00:11:39	00:11:40	Good, you're dressed.
184	00:11:40	00:11:42	We got to go. Hi.
185	00:11:42	00:11:44	Honey, look, if you don't have the time...
186	00:11:44	00:11:45	No, I-I want to take you home.
187	00:11:45	00:11:46	I just can't stick around.
188	00:11:46	00:11:48	Got a call. All hands on deck.
189	00:11:48	00:11:50	That's the diner? Mm-hmm.
190	00:11:50	00:11:52	Finn told me that she had that handled.
191	00:11:52	00:11:55	Well, I got all hands.
192	00:11:55	00:11:57	All right. I better take off.
193	00:11:57	00:11:59	I'm happy to see you.
194	00:11:59	00:12:00	Really, thanks for stopping by.
195	00:12:00	00:12:01	Yeah.
196	00:12:01	00:12:03	See you there.
197	00:12:08	00:12:10	Hey.
198	00:12:10	00:12:12	You're not supposed to be working, remember?
199	00:12:12	00:12:14	No, you're right.
200	00:12:14	00:12:16	Hmm.
201	00:12:16	00:12:17	I'm gonna get a nurse.
202	00:12:17	00:12:19	Get you out of here.
203	00:12:25	00:12:28	Yeah, it's Ecklie. Get me the sheriff.
204	00:12:30	00:12:37	You know, I appreciate you having my back, but I think you might have misrepresented the situation just a little bit.
205	00:12:37	00:12:39	Yeah, in what way?
206	00:12:39	00:12:42	Pretty sure that I said that it was something that I could handle.
207	00:12:42	00:12:47	I think your exact words were, It's nothing to worry about.
208	00:12:47	00:12:48	Oh, and are you worried?
209	00:12:48	00:12:49	Yeah, a little bit.
210	00:12:49	00:12:51	You look stumped.
211	00:12:51	00:12:52	I'm not stumped.
212	00:12:52	00:12:53	I'm thinking.
213	00:12:53	00:12:57	I've released the other bodies, but there's something odd about these three.
214	00:12:57	00:12:59	I'm going with stumped.
215	00:13:00	00:13:03	Thinking.
216	00:13:03	00:13:06	Look at the blood on this guy's chin.
217	00:13:06	00:13:09	Unless gravity's been altered, it's going the wrong way.
218	00:13:09	00:13:11	Yeah, you're right.
219	00:13:11	00:13:14	This guy's lying down now, but he had to be upright when he was shot. Mm-hmm.
220	00:13:14	00:13:17	And over here, on this guy...
221	00:13:19	00:13:22	There's no exit wound, and yet, his back is all bloody.
222	00:13:22	00:13:25	Which means he was laying down, not sitting.
223	00:13:25	00:13:26	Where's her wound?
224	00:13:30	00:13:33	(sighs) On the right.
225	00:13:33	00:13:37	How was she shot on the right while she was sitting here?
226	00:13:37	00:13:40	She wasn't.
227	00:13:40	00:13:45	Someone moved all three of these bodies after they were shot.
228	00:13:51	00:13:52	Hey. Hi.
229	00:13:52	00:13:54	Whoa.
230	00:13:54	00:13:55	They had a camera in the walk-in?
231	00:13:55	00:14:00	Yeah, Vincent said someone was pilfering steak and lobster a while back.
232	00:14:00	00:14:02	How long was Vincent in there?
233	00:14:02	00:14:10	Well, the camera's motion-activated, and there's no time code, so I checked cell records from the first time he dialed his brother until the cops let him out.
234	00:14:10	00:14:12	Under seven minutes.
235	00:14:12	00:14:14	You buy he got locked in there?
236	00:14:14	00:14:17	It happens easier than you'd think.
237	00:14:17	00:14:18	Not interrupting.
238	00:14:18	00:14:22	I just, uh... I wanted to find out about, uh, your father.
239	00:14:22	00:14:26	Uh, he's getting out of the hospital today, and I wanted to see how that all went.
240	00:14:26	00:14:28	It was... fine.
241	00:14:28	00:14:30	Thank you for asking, though.
242	00:14:30	00:14:32	Yeah, it's, uh, no trouble at all.
243	00:14:32	00:14:35	Uh, to ask, I mean.
244	00:14:37	00:14:39	Uh, yeah, I'm-I'm... I'm gonna go.
245	00:14:44	00:14:45	Did he seem weird to you?
246	00:14:45	00:14:48	I mean, weirder than usual.
247	00:14:48	00:14:51	No, not at all.
248	00:14:52	00:14:54	I got three more in the hallway.
249	00:14:54	00:14:56	Well, I can always use the overtime.
250	00:14:56	00:14:58	Why don't you, uh, prep this young lady?
251	00:14:58	00:15:01	I'm almost done with Dahlia. Yeah.
252	00:15:11	00:15:12	Can I help you?
253	00:15:12	00:15:15	I'm looking for a loved one who was brought in.
254	00:15:15	00:15:16	Edie Graham.
255	00:15:19	00:15:21	Reception let you come back here?
256	00:15:21	00:15:25	I might have given them the impression I worked for the mortuary.
257	00:15:25	00:15:27	So, you're the next of kin?
258	00:15:27	00:15:29	I'm the closest thing Edie's got.
259	00:15:29	00:15:31	We were gonna be married.
260	00:15:32	00:15:34	I see, Mr...
261	00:15:34	00:15:36	Basderic.
262	00:15:36	00:15:40	David, call Sara.
263	00:15:40	00:15:45	Tell her to bring down Edie's paperwork right away for Mr. Basderic.
264	00:15:45	00:15:47	Right.
265	00:16:06	00:16:08	We met at the diner where she worked.
266	00:16:08	00:16:10	I went in there a lot.
267	00:16:10	00:16:14	She was always so good to me.
268	00:16:14	00:16:16	So warm.
269	00:16:16	00:16:17	I just knew.
270	00:16:19	00:16:23	And I could see in her eyes... she felt it, too.
271	00:16:23	00:16:25	I'm sorry for your loss.
272	00:16:33	00:16:35	Right there.
273	00:16:35	00:16:37	I can't allow you to touch her.
274	00:16:49	00:16:52	I'd like to put the ring on her finger.
275	00:16:52	00:16:55	No, I'm sorry.
276	00:16:56	00:16:59	That's him. That's Basderic.
277	00:17:06	00:17:08	Hello, Ronald.
278	00:17:13	00:17:14	It's a match.
279	00:17:17	00:17:18	You're done, you son of a bitch.
280	00:17:28	00:17:29	Where are my clothes?
281	00:17:29	00:17:30	I want my clothes.
282	00:17:30	00:17:34	That prison jumpsuit is the only clothes you need to worry about now.
283	00:17:34	00:17:39	When you return them, I expect them to be in the condition in which you received them.
284	00:17:39	00:17:40	I'm very particular.
285	00:17:40	00:17:42	We have you in the diner, Ronald.
286	00:17:42	00:17:44	You stepped in Edie's blood.
287	00:17:47	00:17:48	I went in to check on her.
288	00:17:48	00:17:51	Cops saw you stalking her from outside right before the shooting.
289	00:17:51	00:17:53	I wasn't stalking; I was observing.
290	00:17:53	00:17:54	You were there.
291	00:17:54	00:17:55	Yes.
292	00:17:55	00:17:59	But I knew the officers would harass me, so I took a walk around the block.
293	00:17:59	00:18:02	When I got back, I could tell something was wrong.
294	00:18:02	00:18:05	That's when I went inside.
295	00:18:07	00:18:09	She was already dead.
296	00:18:09	00:18:10	Why didn't you call 911?
297	00:18:10	00:18:12	Because she was already dead.
298	00:18:12	00:18:16	Okay, you didn't do it, so you must have seen who did.
299	00:18:16	00:18:19	I told you, I went for a walk around the block.
300	00:18:21	00:18:25	If I knew who killed Edie, I would tell you.
301	00:18:25	00:18:27	They took her from me.
302	00:18:27	00:18:29	She was mine.
303	00:18:31	00:18:33	Do you own a gun, Ronald?
304	00:18:34	00:18:36	I would never. I hate guns.
305	00:18:38	00:18:40	Open your mouth.
306	00:18:40	00:18:42	No.
307	00:18:42	00:18:44	You can't make me.
308	00:18:44	00:18:45	Not without my consent.
309	00:18:45	00:18:46	I can get a court order.
310	00:18:46	00:18:49	Good luck with that.
311	00:18:49	00:18:53	I can't imagine too many judges being receptive to your requests.
312	00:18:53	00:18:56	What with your corruption scandal and all.
313	00:19:04	00:19:06	Three bodies all moved after the fact.
314	00:19:06	00:19:09	Why were they moved, and who moved them?
315	00:19:09	00:19:10	Do we know who they are?
316	00:19:10	00:19:12	Yeah, this is Connie.
317	00:19:12	00:19:14	She was a regular at the diner.
318	00:19:14	00:19:19	00 a.m. shift so that she could be at home with her grandkids in the afternoon.
319	00:19:19	00:19:21	Their mom's a blackjack dealer.
320	00:19:21	00:19:23	This one I don't know.
321	00:19:23	00:19:25	Who is this, Super Dave?
322	00:19:25	00:19:28	Oh, I found an Arizona driver's license.
323	00:19:28	00:19:29	Robert Rios.
324	00:19:29	00:19:32	I ran him through mobile AFIS.
325	00:19:32	00:19:33	There's no criminal history.
326	00:19:36	00:19:39	And this guy, Alex Brenner.
327	00:19:39	00:19:40	Local address.
328	00:19:40	00:19:42	Look at that, brand-new license.
329	00:19:42	00:19:43	Mint condition.
330	00:19:43	00:19:45	I'm running his prints now.
331	00:19:52	00:19:54	Access blocked.
332	00:19:54	00:19:57	I have a feeling our friend Alex Brenner here isn't Alex Brenner.
333	00:19:57	00:20:02	Sheriff, I'm aware of the pressure that you're getting from the press on this case.
334	00:20:02	00:20:04	No, I know, I get it, I get it.
335	00:20:04	00:20:06	No, I don't disagree.
336	00:20:06	00:20:09	No, especially in light of what's going on in the department.
337	00:20:09	00:20:13	But I have a feeling that the answer you're looking for is staring at me right now in my office.
338	00:20:13	00:20:14	I'll get back to you.
339	00:20:14	00:20:16	Captain.
340	00:20:16	00:20:18	Karen Taylor, Deputy U.S. Marshal.
341	00:20:18	00:20:20	Your department ran fingerprints on someone we have an interest in.
342	00:20:20	00:20:22	Alex Brenner.
343	00:20:22	00:20:24	That's what you Feds are calling him, right?
344	00:20:24	00:20:28	And since it's U.S. Marshals in my office and not FBI, I'm guessing he was in Witness Protection.
345	00:20:28	00:20:30	So, who is he really?
346	00:20:30	00:20:31	Obviously, I can't tell you that.
347	00:20:31	00:20:32	Who are you protecting him from?
348	00:20:32	00:20:38	I can't tell you that, either. Miss Taylor, you dropped this guy in my jurisdiction without even bothering to call the department.
349	00:20:38	00:20:45	Now he's one of eight victims in a multiple homicide that just so happened to have killed several of my friends.
350	00:20:45	00:20:49	Now, you got about two seconds to tell me something or I'll have you thrown out of here.
351	00:20:50	00:20:54	Alex Brenner testified against some really bad people about four months ago.
352	00:20:54	00:20:57	We dropped him in Las Vegas just last week.
353	00:20:57	00:21:03	As for our failure to notify LVPD, frankly, we didn't know if you could be trusted.
354	00:21:03	00:21:05	(sighs) Okay.
355	00:21:05	00:21:11	So, these bad people, are they the kind that would sacrifice seven innocent lives just to get the one they want?
356	00:21:11	00:21:13	I believe so.
357	00:21:13	00:21:15	Yes.
358	00:21:21	00:21:24	Pretty intense look you have going on there.
359	00:21:24	00:21:26	What are you searching for?
360	00:21:26	00:21:28	Edie's stalker, Basderic.
361	00:21:28	00:21:30	He knows the law.
362	00:21:30	00:21:33	Up until last night, he has known exactly how far he could go without crossing the line.
363	00:21:33	00:21:34	Okay.
364	00:21:34	00:21:36	But the guy is sick.
365	00:21:36	00:21:37	Edie couldn't have been his first.
366	00:21:37	00:21:39	He-he must've screwed up somewhere before.
367	00:21:39	00:21:42	I just haven't been able to find it.
368	00:21:42	00:21:47	Well, have you tried searching court records for other TROs or denied apps?
369	00:21:47	00:21:48	Yeah, I did that.
370	00:21:48	00:21:50	I'm on criminal records now.
371	00:21:50	00:21:53	Ok, well, how about I take civil court.
372	00:21:53	00:21:54	Basderic's not a common name.
373	00:21:54	00:21:56	Well, you never know.
374	00:21:56	00:22:00	Oh, here's something. Apparently, Basderic was involved in a lawsuit.
375	00:22:00	00:22:02	Who sued him?
376	00:22:02	00:22:04	Actually, he was the plaintiff.
377	00:22:04	00:22:06	He sued for damages after some guy assaulted him.
378	00:22:06	00:22:12	Well, what do you want to bet that the guy was the boyfriend or the husband of some poor woman that Basderic was stalking?
379	00:22:12	00:22:18	Well, the judge sided with Basderic and awarded him almost $200,000.
380	00:22:18	00:22:20	I hate this guy.
381	00:22:20	00:22:22	I hate the way he works the law.
382	00:22:22	00:22:30	Well, this probably won't ease your blood pressure any, but during the assault, Basderic actually shot the guy.
383	00:22:30	00:22:32	He shot his attacker?
384	00:22:32	00:22:34	Legally, it was self-defense.
385	00:22:34	00:22:36	Point is...
386	00:22:36	00:22:38	he had a gun.
387	00:22:38	00:22:41	Hey, Doc. Hey.
388	00:22:41	00:22:43	We need to take a long, hard look at Alex Brenner.
389	00:22:43	00:22:45	You care to elaborate?
390	00:22:45	00:22:48	Well, he was in the Witness Protection Program.
391	00:22:48	00:22:50	We're thinking maybe that's what got him killed.
392	00:22:50	00:22:51	Along with everybody else in the diner.
393	00:22:51	00:22:53	What can you tell us about where he's been?
394	00:22:53	00:22:55	Well, there are some things that suggest his history.
395	00:22:55	00:22:57	Dental work, certainly.
396	00:22:57	00:22:58	I don't think it was done in the U.S.
397	00:22:58	00:23:00	Mexico, maybe. Hmm.
398	00:23:00	00:23:01	What else?
399	00:23:01	00:23:03	He was suffering from talcosis.
400	00:23:03	00:23:05	I found talc granulomas in his lungs.
401	00:23:05	00:23:09	Talc? Yeah, it's a condition usually associated with drug use.
402	00:23:09	00:23:13	People inject talc-diluted heroin or cocaine.
403	00:23:13	00:23:15	But there's no evidence that he was a drug user.
404	00:23:15	00:23:18	So how did the talc get into his body? Probably inhaled.
405	00:23:18	00:23:23	I'm thinking that he spent a lot of time in an environment where talc was used, breathed it in.
406	00:23:23	00:23:24	Yeah, drug environment.
407	00:23:24	00:23:27	If he was cutting heroin and cocaine with talc.
408	00:23:27	00:23:29	It's not an unreasonable inference.
409	00:23:29	00:23:31	Stomach content was waffles.
410	00:23:31	00:23:32	Is that significant?
411	00:23:32	00:23:37	If he ate waffles, that puts him in the corner booth where we found Rios.
412	00:23:39	00:23:41	What did Rios eat?
413	00:23:46	00:23:48	Hmm.
414	00:23:48	00:23:51	His stomach was filled with pizza.
415	00:23:51	00:23:54	Frank's Diner doesn't serve pizza.
416	00:23:54	00:23:56	Maybe he wasn't there to eat.
417	00:23:56	00:23:58	Okay, what more can you tell us about Rios?
418	00:23:58	00:24:02	I found fibers in his upper trachea and esophagus as well as his mouth.
419	00:24:02	00:24:05	I gave them to Hodges, but he hasn't tested them yet.
420	00:24:05	00:24:08	Until a minute ago, Mr. Rios here was on the back burner.
421	00:24:08	00:24:10	He's on the front burner now.
422	00:24:13	00:24:20	The pizza would have raised a red flag had I known that the diner didn't serve pizza, but I didn't know that the diner didn't serve pizza.
423	00:24:20	00:24:22	You care to guess why?
424	00:24:22	00:24:26	Because no one ever includes me whenever they go to the diner.
425	00:24:27	00:24:29	Positive for lead.
426	00:24:30	00:24:32	What about the fiber?
427	00:24:34	00:24:36	It's a microfiber.
428	00:24:36	00:24:40	Polyethylene terephthalate to be more precise.
429	00:24:40	00:24:42	More commonly known as polar fleece.
430	00:24:42	00:24:44	Like a jacket.
431	00:24:44	00:24:51	Or, considering that he inhaled it, I think Rios was wearing a ski mask.
432	00:24:56	00:24:58	The belt tested positive for lead.
433	00:24:58	00:24:59	Tells me he had a gun.
434	00:24:59	00:25:01	And a mask.
435	00:25:01	00:25:04	Robert Rios was not a victim.
436	00:25:04	00:25:07	He was the shooter.
437	00:25:11	00:25:14	Robert Rios had an Arizona license.
438	00:25:14	00:25:17	PD's there checking into him now.
439	00:25:17	00:25:20	I guess the bigger question is, if Rios is our shooter, who shot Rios?
440	00:25:20	00:25:22	Probably whoever hired him.
441	00:25:22	00:25:24	Could be the cartel if they were after Alex Brenner.
442	00:25:24	00:25:30	You know, once the dirty work's done, you bring somebody in; a cleaner.
443	00:25:30	00:25:32	Kill Rios, take his gun, move the bodies.
444	00:25:32	00:25:33	Okay, you know what?
445	00:25:33	00:25:35	Let's not wait for the cops in Arizona.
446	00:25:35	00:25:37	Dig into Rios. Get whatever you can, okay?
447	00:25:37	00:25:39	All right, I'm on it.
448	00:25:45	00:25:47	All right, I'm here. What's the issue?
449	00:25:47	00:25:51	I ran ballistics on all 15 rounds that were fired.
450	00:25:51	00:25:53	Turns out five of them were from a second gun.
451	00:25:53	00:25:58	Well, that's consistent with the idea of a cleaner, right? We know at least two of the shots were the ones that killed Rios.
452	00:25:58	00:26:01	And we've got the point-blank on the waitress, Edie.
453	00:26:01	00:26:03	Then I've got two misses.
454	00:26:03	00:26:05	Misses?
455	00:26:05	00:26:08	Wouldn't have thought a cleaner would be sloppy.
456	00:26:08	00:26:10	That's not all. Check this out.
457	00:26:10	00:26:13	The red laser is a miss from Rios's gun.
458	00:26:13	00:26:14	The green is the cleaner's.
459	00:26:18	00:26:22	Two different guns, both fired from the same place.
460	00:26:22	00:26:23	Doesn't make any sense.
461	00:26:23	00:26:25	Yeah.
462	00:26:25	00:26:27	Is that can where it was when you found it?
463	00:26:27	00:26:29	No, it was on the floor. I replaced it.
464	00:26:29	00:26:34	But there was oil residue on the counter, so I knew where to put it.
465	00:26:36	00:26:38	Let me try something here.
466	00:26:38	00:26:40	Excuse me a sec.
467	00:26:42	00:26:44	Square peg in a square hole.
468	00:26:48	00:26:51	Shots came from there. Alex Brenner had the second gun.
469	00:26:51	00:26:53	It fits with everything we know about him.
470	00:26:53	00:26:55	He was in Witness Protection.
471	00:26:55	00:26:58	He was fearing for his life, so he was carrying.
472	00:26:58	00:27:01	Call Finn. Get her down here. I want to run this thing.
473	00:27:02	00:27:04	Okay, I'm Rios. I'm the shooter.
474	00:27:04	00:27:06	Where do we start?
475	00:27:06	00:27:07	Okay, first event happens here.
476	00:27:07	00:27:11	Owen and the shooter struggle, and fight for control of the gun.
477	00:27:16	00:27:19	The gun discharges, severing Owen's finger.
478	00:27:24	00:27:30	Okay, and then at some point during the struggle, Dahlia gets up off of her stool, and comes over and tries to help.
479	00:27:33	00:27:39	First shot misses, hits the chocolate milk shake, and the next two take Dahlia down.
480	00:27:39	00:27:42	Now, I just shot two people pretty quickly.
481	00:27:42	00:27:46	If I'm robbing the place, why don't I just turn around and leave?
482	00:27:46	00:27:47	Why do I keep killing?
483	00:27:47	00:27:49	Well, we know that you were wearing a mask.
484	00:27:49	00:27:51	Maybe it came off during the struggle.
485	00:27:51	00:27:53	So I'm eliminating witnesses.
486	00:27:53	00:27:56	Or you haven't hit your target yet.
487	00:27:58	00:28:00	So the waitress is next?
488	00:28:00	00:28:03	Shot goes through the coffee pot, and then into her chest.
489	00:28:03	00:28:05	What about the coup de grâce?
490	00:28:05	00:28:08	Well, given that Edie crawled, that actually comes later.
491	00:28:08	00:28:11	The old couple comes next.
492	00:28:11	00:28:13	They are sitting targets, literally.
493	00:28:13	00:28:18	He tries to shield her, he gets the first shot, and she gets the second.
494	00:28:21	00:28:24	Alex and the bus driver Connie.
495	00:28:24	00:28:28	Yeah, she goes first, running towards the restrooms, probably trying to escape.
496	00:28:28	00:28:32	Shot catches her in the side, just below her armpit.
497	00:28:32	00:28:35	That leaves Alex, and he just saw me shoot six people.
498	00:28:35	00:28:37	And we now know he has a gun.
499	00:28:37	00:28:39	And he knows that I'm coming for him.
500	00:28:39	00:28:41	So he tries to defend himself.
501	00:28:41	00:28:45	Both shots miss and hit the olive oil can.
502	00:28:45	00:28:47	And I put two into him.
503	00:28:47	00:28:50	As far as Rios goes, that's the end of the shooting.
504	00:28:50	00:28:51	Time for the cleaner.
505	00:28:51	00:28:53	Say that's me.
506	00:28:53	00:28:58	Vincent said that they kept the back door open to let air in, so I could have come from back here.
507	00:28:58	00:29:01	And I, Rios, know you, so I don't shoot.
508	00:29:01	00:29:05	But I do something that you are definitely not expecting.
509	00:29:05	00:29:09	I pick up Alex's gun, and I shoot you.
510	00:29:11	00:29:16	the coup de grâce to Edie's head.
511	00:29:16	00:29:18	So Edie crawls out from behind the counter.
512	00:29:18	00:29:20	I realize she's alive.
513	00:29:20	00:29:21	She's just seen me shoot Rios.
514	00:29:21	00:29:24	I go up to her and...
515	00:29:24	00:29:28	final shot. So the theory is Alex was the target. Wait a minute.
516	00:29:28	00:29:31	It still doesn't explain Edie's stalker, Basderic.
517	00:29:31	00:29:33	We know he was here.
518	00:29:33	00:29:34	He left shoe impressions right there.
519	00:29:34	00:29:38	So are you thinking that Basderic put the kill shot into Edie?
520	00:29:38	00:29:39	He felt rebuffed by her.
521	00:29:39	00:29:40	We know he's gone off before.
522	00:29:40	00:29:42	He lied about never having had a gun.
523	00:29:42	00:29:44	(phone rings) Hold on a sec.
524	00:29:44	00:29:46	Hey, Nick.
525	00:29:46	00:29:48	Yeah, just got access to Robert Rios's banking records.
526	00:29:48	00:29:52	Somebody we know has been writing him some big checks. Who?
527	00:29:52	00:29:54	His ex-girlfriend.
528	00:29:57	00:30:00	You know, Mrs. DeMarcus, this must be a complicated time.
529	00:30:00	00:30:01	I mean, who do you mourn?
530	00:30:01	00:30:06	Your dead husband or the other guy you were involved with?
531	00:30:06	00:30:09	There was nothing going on between me and Robert.
532	00:30:09	00:30:11	Well, not anymore. So you didn't pay him to kill your husband?
533	00:30:11	00:30:13	Why would you think that?
534	00:30:13	00:30:14	You gave him $6,000 last month.
535	00:30:14	00:30:18	$5,000 the month before.
536	00:30:18	00:30:19	$10,000 the month before that.
537	00:30:19	00:30:22	I help Robert out. I have for a long time.
538	00:30:23	00:30:25	He had a gambling problem.
539	00:30:25	00:30:26	He owed people money.
540	00:30:26	00:30:29	I didn't want to see him hurt. Mmm.
541	00:30:29	00:30:30	Why on earth would I want Owen dead?
542	00:30:30	00:30:32	I don't know.
543	00:30:32	00:30:33	Maybe your marriage was in trouble.
544	00:30:33	00:30:36	Our marriage wasn't in trouble.
545	00:30:38	00:30:40	Owen and I were fine.
546	00:30:40	00:30:48	Owen didn't love the fact that she kept bailing out Rios, but it was her money.
547	00:30:48	00:30:51	That's what you get for marrying a rich girl.
548	00:30:51	00:30:53	Did you ever hear them fight about it?
549	00:30:53	00:30:55	Sure, but they fought all the time.
550	00:30:55	00:30:57	That was part of the attraction.
551	00:30:57	00:30:58	That kind of passion can turn bad.
552	00:30:58	00:31:00	Believe me, I've seen it happen.
553	00:31:00	00:31:05	Not them. I-I-I'm telling you, things were going well.
554	00:31:05	00:31:06	Even the money thing.
555	00:31:06	00:31:08	What do you mean by that?
556	00:31:08	00:31:11	Owen and I were working a deal with the Mediterranean.
557	00:31:11	00:31:14	They want to put a Frank's Diner in the casino.
558	00:31:14	00:31:17	Owen was about to have plenty of money of his own.
559	00:31:17	00:31:19	Both of us.
560	00:31:21	00:31:23	Trust me, Nick.
561	00:31:23	00:31:26	There's no way Sheila is the one who's behind what happened.
562	00:31:26	00:31:28	All units, possible 413, shots fired.
563	00:31:28	00:31:30	Corner of Dermott and Westfall.
564	00:31:30	00:31:32	Corner of Dermott and Westfall. Repeat...
565	00:31:32	00:31:33	That's the diner.
566	00:31:33	00:31:35	What's going on?
567	00:31:35	00:31:37	Uh, not sure. Shots fired at the diner.
568	00:31:37	00:31:41	No, stay here, Vincent. We'll handle it.
569	00:31:43	00:31:45	Coming through.
570	00:31:45	00:31:46	Coming through. What's up?
571	00:31:46	00:31:48	Nick, relax, man.
572	00:31:48	00:31:50	What's up? Code four.
573	00:31:50	00:31:51	Accidental discharge.
574	00:31:51	00:31:53	Newspaper guy.
575	00:31:56	00:31:58	What's he doing out of bed?
576	00:32:01	00:32:04	Hey, Ecklie.
577	00:32:05	00:32:07	Didn't you get shot?
578	00:32:07	00:32:08	Come on, man, you know the drill.
579	00:32:08	00:32:10	You got to give yourself some time to heal here.
580	00:32:10	00:32:13	Thanks for the advice, Nick. Here's the gun.
581	00:32:15	00:32:16	Nine-millimeter?
582	00:32:16	00:32:18	That's the same caliber as the diner. Yep.
583	00:32:18	00:32:20	Guy was refilling the newspaper machines.
584	00:32:20	00:32:25	He took the day-old papers out, was stacking them in his truck for recycling when the gun fell out.
585	00:32:25	00:32:27	He picked it up. It discharged.
586	00:32:27	00:32:29	Where's the second one?
587	00:32:31	00:32:34	We know there were two guns.
588	00:32:45	00:32:47	Here we go.
589	00:32:47	00:32:50	This one's a little bit thicker than the others.
590	00:32:54	00:32:55	There she is.
591	00:32:55	00:32:58	The second gun.
592	00:33:00	00:33:03	Both of these guns have been wiped clean.
593	00:33:03	00:33:05	Same with the shells.
594	00:33:05	00:33:06	There's nothing on them.
595	00:33:07	00:33:10	But the ninhydrins brought up some useful prints on the paper.
596	00:33:13	00:33:15	Okay.
597	00:33:15	00:33:23	It sounds to me like after the shooting, our guy leaves the diner looking to dump the guns somewhere and sees the newspaper machine.
598	00:33:23	00:33:26	For a buck in quarters, he's found a pretty good place to hide them.
599	00:33:26	00:33:33	It's already Monday-- it's unlikely that anybody's going to buy the Sunday paper, so the guns stay put until the delivery guy hauls them away.
600	00:33:33	00:33:35	Mm-hmm.
601	00:33:36	00:33:38	We got a match.
602	00:33:38	00:33:40	Ronald Basderic.
603	00:33:47	00:33:50	How'd you meet Rios?
604	00:33:50	00:33:52	Gamblers Anonymous?
605	00:33:52	00:33:53	Some twisted chat room?
606	00:33:53	00:33:55	I don't know what you're talking about.
607	00:33:55	00:33:57	I don't know any Rios.
608	00:33:57	00:34:00	Listen, Ronald, we're just trying to give you a chance to explain yourself.
609	00:34:00	00:34:01	Your fingerprints are on the paper.
610	00:34:01	00:34:03	The gun was inside.
611	00:34:03	00:34:04	Your footprints are in the diner.
612	00:34:04	00:34:08	You are never going to see the light of day again.
613	00:34:13	00:34:15	Hey.
614	00:34:15	00:34:17	Don't touch the evidence.
615	00:34:17	00:34:20	Can you just fix that?
616	00:34:28	00:34:31	That newspaper machine is on public property.
617	00:34:31	00:34:33	I can legally be there.
618	00:34:33	00:34:35	I can watch Edie from there.
619	00:34:42	00:34:44	Hey.
620	00:34:44	00:34:47	You know how, when you make a sandwich, you don't like to use the heel?
621	00:34:47	00:34:51	Right, so when you open up the package of bread, what do you do?
622	00:34:51	00:34:58	I, uh... well, I move the heel out of the way, reach past it and I grab a slice from the middle of the loaf. Yeah, me, too.
623	00:34:58	00:35:01	What's your point? The point is, it's the same thing with a newspaper machine.
624	00:35:01	00:35:05	You don't take the top copy, right, that has a fold in it?
625	00:35:05	00:35:07	You lift it up, and you take the one underneath.
626	00:35:07	00:35:10	Especially if you're as OCD as this guy is.
627	00:35:10	00:35:15	So he lifts it up and takes a clean copy from the middle.
628	00:35:15	00:35:20	He bought a paper the day before-- this one was on top-- and that's how his prints got on it?
629	00:35:20	00:35:23	You think Basderic's prints were already there when the cleaner hid the guns there?
630	00:35:26	00:35:28	Hey. Hey.
631	00:35:28	00:35:29	Find anything?
632	00:35:29	00:35:35	Do you have any idea how many people touch this thing on a given day, week, month?
633	00:35:35	00:35:36	You check the inside?
634	00:35:36	00:35:38	Door won't open.
635	00:35:38	00:35:40	You need a quarter?
636	00:35:40	00:35:42	Oh, that's funny.
637	00:35:42	00:35:44	But the coin slot's jammed.
638	00:35:44	00:35:47	it's not by accident.
639	00:35:47	00:35:51	Whoever stashed those guns probably didn't want anyone to find them.
640	00:36:13	00:36:14	What is it?
641	00:36:14	00:36:17	It's a foreign coin.
642	00:36:17	00:36:19	Chinese.
643	00:36:20	00:36:21	Is that bad?
644	00:36:32	00:36:34	Nick, you know me.
645	00:36:34	00:36:36	I thought I did.
646	00:36:36	00:36:37	Till I found that.
647	00:36:39	00:36:45	You keep a bowl below the register for all the foreign coins that end up at the diner.
648	00:36:45	00:36:47	You showed it to me once, remember?
649	00:36:47	00:36:48	Come on, it's a coin. So what?
650	00:36:48	00:36:52	So I don't miss details, Vincent.
651	00:36:52	00:36:55	I want you to take a look at a couple of photos.
652	00:37:01	00:37:04	That's the apron you had on when you went into the fridge.
653	00:37:04	00:37:06	And that's the one you had on when we let you out.
654	00:37:08	00:37:09	Take a look at the strands.
655	00:37:10	00:37:13	This one's white, and this one's blue.
656	00:37:15	00:37:17	You switched the aprons.
657	00:37:17	00:37:19	Wh-What?
658	00:37:19	00:37:20	Why would I do that?
659	00:37:20	00:37:22	To hide the evidence.
660	00:37:22	00:37:25	It's the same reason you moved the bodies and dumped the mop bucket.
661	00:37:30	00:37:32	Here's the apron you started with.
662	00:37:34	00:37:37	I had to tear the back room apart, but I found it.
663	00:37:37	00:37:43	You've been working in that restaurant since you were ten years old.
664	00:37:43	00:37:45	I've never even known you to take a vacation.
665	00:37:45	00:37:47	I mean, I've seen the car that you drive.
666	00:37:47	00:37:52	You've sacrificed everything to keep that family business going.
667	00:37:52	00:37:55	But your brother-- he's a different story, isn't he?
668	00:37:55	00:38:00	He married a rich girl, he buys nice things, he travels.
669	00:38:00	00:38:03	And then, finally, one day, your ship comes in.
670	00:38:03	00:38:08	The Mediterranean wants to put a Frank's Diner in the casino.
671	00:38:08	00:38:11	That's got to be a big payday, Vincent.
672	00:38:11	00:38:15	How much was that worth?
673	00:38:15	00:38:17	I don't know. Sure, you do.
674	00:38:17	00:38:19	You know exactly how much.
675	00:38:19	00:38:21	But your brother, he vetoed it.
676	00:38:21	00:38:22	Didn't he?
677	00:38:22	00:38:24	He said no.
678	00:38:24	00:38:25	Hmm?
679	00:38:26	00:38:29	That was my payoff.
680	00:38:29	00:38:33	My reward for 40 years of giving everything.
681	00:38:35	00:38:38	And he said no, just like that.
682	00:38:38	00:38:42	And now eight people are dead.
683	00:38:43	00:38:45	I never wanted that to happen.
684	00:38:45	00:38:50	Rios was supposed to do a fake robbery.
685	00:38:50	00:38:53	I knew Owen would fight back.
686	00:38:53	00:38:56	Rios was just supposed to shoot him and get out.
687	00:38:56	00:38:58	That's it.
688	00:38:58	00:38:59	What the hell did you do?
689	00:38:59	00:39:00	What'd you do?
690	00:39:00	00:39:01	He pulled off my mask.
691	00:39:01	00:39:03	They saw my face. I had no choice.
692	00:39:03	00:39:07	And at that point, you knew there was no turning back, so you shot him.
693	00:39:12	00:39:19	You were afraid that we'd eventually connect Rios back to you, so you tried to make him look like a customer.
694	00:39:19	00:39:21	And moved the bodies.
695	00:39:23	00:39:25	The apron.
696	00:39:25	00:39:27	The mop bucket.
697	00:39:30	00:39:33	Like you said, I... I learned a few things.
698	00:39:33	00:39:34	Not enough.
699	00:39:36	00:39:38	Nick, please.
700	00:39:40	00:39:43	Don't look at me like that.
701	00:39:43	00:39:45	I was just desperate.
702	00:39:46	00:39:48	Just pushed too far.
703	00:39:49	00:39:51	I'm not a monster.
704	00:39:51	00:39:53	No?
705	00:39:53	00:39:55	What about Edie?
706	00:39:56	00:39:59	She was still alive, wasn't she?
707	00:40:01	00:40:04	And she witnessed everything that you did.
708	00:40:05	00:40:08	So you put a gun to her head...
709	00:40:14	00:40:16	...and you pulled the trigger.
710	00:40:35	00:40:38	You see?
711	00:40:38	00:40:40	You were wrong about me.
712	00:40:44	00:40:47	I didn't hurt her.
713	00:40:47	00:40:49	I couldn't. I loved her.
714	00:40:49	00:40:50	You loved her?
715	00:40:50	00:40:52	Are you kidding me?
716	00:40:54	00:40:55	You terrorized her.
717	00:40:55	00:40:57	You kept her awake at night.
718	00:40:57	00:41:00	You made her afraid to walk down the street.
719	00:41:00	00:41:03	And you want to know what else your twisted love did?
720	00:41:03	00:41:05	It killed her, Ronald.
721	00:41:05	00:41:08	00.
722	00:41:08	00:41:14	She should have been gone when the shooting happened, but she was afraid to walk home because she was afraid that you were out there.
723	00:41:14	00:41:18	It's because of you that she stayed, and now she's dead.
724	00:41:38	00:41:40	I know, Barbara.
725	00:41:40	00:41:43	I-I know that.
726	00:41:43	00:41:45	But this is our home now.
727	00:41:45	00:41:47	I'm here. Charlie's here.
728	00:41:51	00:41:54	Uh, sweetheart, I'm going to have to call you back, all right?
729	00:41:54	00:41:56	I got to go.
730	00:41:56	00:41:58	I love you.
731	00:41:58	00:42:00	Hey.
732	00:42:00	00:42:01	Hey.
733	00:42:01	00:42:03	Is Barbara okay?
734	00:42:04	00:42:06	Yeah.
735	00:42:06	00:42:07	When's she coming back?
736	00:42:07	00:42:11	Uh, she's going to stay up in Seattle for a little while longer.
737	00:42:11	00:42:13	Maya needs her.
738	00:42:16	00:42:19	Do you need me to stay for anything?
739	00:42:20	00:42:22	No. Go home.
740	00:42:22	00:42:25	Thank you.
741	00:42:25	00:42:27	And good work on this one.
742	00:42:27	00:42:29	Thanks.
