0,00:00:20,00:00:21,Hi.
1,00:00:21,00:00:22,Hey.
2,00:00:22,00:00:25,Husband and wife got into it.
3,00:00:25,00:00:26,Hmm.
4,00:00:26,00:00:27,Hmm.
5,00:00:27,00:00:28,What set them off?
6,00:00:28,00:00:30,She caught him with a hooker in their bed.
7,00:00:30,00:00:31,She cut him.
8,00:00:31,00:00:33,He killed her.
9,00:00:33,00:00:34,What about the hooker?
10,00:00:34,00:00:36,She grabbed his wallet and took off.
11,00:00:36,00:00:38,I caught the guy just sitting on a curb.
12,00:00:38,00:00:39,I swabbed his hands for blood spatter.
13,00:00:39,00:00:42,I am super backed up.
14,00:00:42,00:00:43,Can this wait till tomorrow?
15,00:00:43,00:00:45,He's not going anywhere.
16,00:00:45,00:00:48,"Thanks, Mia."
17,00:00:48,00:00:49,Yeah...
18,00:00:49,00:00:51,"Oh, hey, guys."
19,00:00:51,00:00:52,I could really use a drink.
20,00:00:52,00:00:54,You want to join me? I'm buying.
21,00:00:54,00:00:56,"I'd love a drink, but we made plans, though?"
22,00:00:56,00:00:57,You did?
23,00:00:57,00:00:58,Tomorrow. Rain check.
24,00:00:58,00:00:59,All right.
25,00:00:59,00:01:01,Rain check.
26,00:01:01,00:01:03,Okay.
27,00:01:10,00:01:12,(crowd chatter)
28,00:01:15,00:01:17,No way you were never married.
29,00:01:17,00:01:18,"Oh, let me guess."
30,00:01:18,00:01:26,"You were young, he seemed more mature than he really was, he swept you off your feet, and, uh, he let you fall."
31,00:01:26,00:01:29,"Bruised, but not broken."
32,00:01:29,00:01:31,Get you another one?
33,00:01:31,00:01:34,"No, I'm good, thanks."
34,00:01:35,00:01:37,So you're divorced?
35,00:01:41,00:01:43,You?
36,00:01:43,00:01:44,Yeah.
37,00:01:44,00:01:47,"She seemed more mature than she really was, swept me off my feet."
38,00:01:47,00:01:48,(laughs)
39,00:01:48,00:01:49,Kids?
40,00:01:49,00:01:53,"Uh, yes, I have a daughter."
41,00:01:53,00:01:56,"If she's got her mother's looks, you're in trouble."
42,00:01:58,00:02:00,(whispering)
43,00:02:03,00:02:06,(chuckling)
44,00:02:06,00:02:08,"If I don't get home soon, I will be in trouble."
45,00:02:12,00:02:13,Thanks. I needed this.
46,00:02:14,00:02:16,"If you're blowing me off, no worries."
47,00:02:16,00:02:18,But if you're not...
48,00:02:23,00:02:24,...give me a call.
49,00:02:30,00:02:31,Wait a second.
50,00:02:31,00:02:33,Let me walk you to your car.
51,00:02:39,00:02:42,(moaning)
52,00:02:44,00:02:46,I can't do this tonight. I...
53,00:02:46,00:02:48,I'll call you.
54,00:02:49,00:02:51,What the hell is your problem?
55,00:02:53,00:02:56,(grunts softly)
56,00:02:56,00:02:58,Go to hell.
57,00:03:00,00:03:01,(Catherine groans)
58,00:03:02,00:03:04,(exhales)
59,00:03:04,00:03:06,You're not worth the trouble.
60,00:03:06,00:03:08,(panting)
61,00:03:13,00:03:16,(phone ringing)
62,00:03:16,00:03:19,(groans and sighs)
63,00:03:19,00:03:21,(ringing continues)
64,00:03:23,00:03:24,(phone beeps)
65,00:03:25,00:03:28,Hello.
66,00:03:28,00:03:31,"(whispering): Mom, Mom."
67,00:03:31,00:03:32,Grissom just called. I've got to go in.
68,00:03:33,00:03:34,I'm backing up grave.
69,00:03:34,00:03:35,(sniffs) What?
70,00:03:35,00:03:38,"Vodka, with an Altoid chaser."
71,00:03:38,00:03:40,I brushed my teeth.
72,00:03:40,00:03:44,"What did you do, walk into a door?"
73,00:03:44,00:03:48,"Hey, listen, Lindsey's got a dentist appointment before school."
74,00:03:48,00:03:50,I wrote all the information down in the kitchen.
75,00:03:50,00:03:52,Okay. Okay?
76,00:03:52,00:03:53,Thank you.
77,00:03:53,00:03:55,"Oh, good grief."
78,00:03:55,00:03:57,(garbled radio transmission)
79,00:04:09,00:04:12,(garbled radio transmission continues)
80,00:04:15,00:04:17,I appreciate this.
81,00:04:17,00:04:18,Everyone's out.
82,00:04:18,00:04:19,I'm short.
83,00:04:19,00:04:22,You're welcome.
84,00:04:23,00:04:24,(camera shutter clicking)
85,00:04:24,00:04:26,WILLOWS: Clotted blood hasn't retracted yet.
86,00:04:26,00:04:28,She hasn't been dead long.
87,00:04:28,00:04:29,We have an I.D.?
88,00:04:29,00:04:32,"Yeah, building manager took a peek."
89,00:04:32,00:04:34,ID'd her as Alice Granger.
90,00:04:34,00:04:35,Apartment 207.
91,00:04:35,00:04:37,Moved here about a month ago.
92,00:04:37,00:04:41,"David, you want to take the, uh, jacket off her face?"
93,00:04:54,00:04:55,What happened to you?
94,00:04:55,00:04:57,I walked into a door.
95,00:04:57,00:04:59,Can we not talk about it?
96,00:05:01,00:05:02,Gunshot.
97,00:05:03,00:05:05,Looks like a small caliber weapon.
98,00:05:07,00:05:09,No cartridge casings.
99,00:05:10,00:05:12,"No purse, no car."
100,00:05:12,00:05:13,I put out a BOLO.
101,00:05:13,00:05:14,Possible car jacking.
102,00:05:14,00:05:18,(whimpering and crying)
103,00:05:19,00:05:21,(gunshot)
104,00:05:23,00:05:27,"Usually when a killer covers the victim's face, it suggests familiarity."
105,00:05:27,00:05:29,An act of contrition.
106,00:05:33,00:05:35,Maybe she knew her attacker.
107,00:05:35,00:05:38,Great. Carjacked by a friend.
108,00:05:38,00:05:39,(phone ringing)
109,00:05:39,00:05:42,Vartann.
110,00:05:42,00:05:43,"Yeah, got it."
111,00:05:43,00:05:45,We got a 20 on her car.
112,00:05:45,00:05:48,"You go, I'll stay with the body, I'll meet you there."
113,00:05:50,00:05:52,(sirens wailing)
114,00:06:11,00:06:12,You see anybody get out of the car?
115,00:06:12,00:06:14,"No, sir. Saw it on patrol."
116,00:06:14,00:06:16,You checked the bar? I waited for you.
117,00:06:16,00:06:17,No one's exited since we got here.
118,00:06:17,00:06:19,"Okay, I'll see you inside."
119,00:06:23,00:06:25,Can you open it up?
120,00:06:34,00:06:36,Thank you.
121,00:06:38,00:06:41,(garbled radio transmission)
122,00:06:52,00:06:55,I found a gun under the seat.
123,00:06:56,00:06:59,.22 Beretta.
124,00:06:59,00:07:01,"Well, that's small enough to be the weapon."
125,00:07:01,00:07:06,"VARTANN: So he shoots her, takes her car, and stops off for a drink."
126,00:07:06,00:07:07,He could still be in there.
127,00:07:09,00:07:11,VARTANN: Let's find out.
128,00:07:14,00:07:18,Did you hear the one about the cop and the monkey who walk into a bar?
129,00:07:18,00:07:20,I'm not in the mood.
130,00:07:20,00:07:22,Neither was the monkey.
131,00:08:16,00:08:18,"Except for the Saturn, all the cars in the lot are accounted for."
132,00:08:18,00:08:20,Okay.
133,00:08:22,00:08:23,VARTANN: Hi. You recognize this girl?
134,00:08:24,00:08:27,WOMAN: Yeah. She's been in a few times. How about last night?
135,00:08:27,00:08:28,Yeah.
136,00:08:29,00:08:31,"Throwing them back pretty good, too."
137,00:08:31,00:08:32,You see anybody hassle her?
138,00:08:32,00:08:34,She was getting a lot of attention.
139,00:08:34,00:08:36,She didn't really seem to mind.
140,00:08:36,00:08:38,Did you see her leave with anyone?
141,00:08:38,00:08:39,No. She was wasted.
142,00:08:39,00:08:41,Had me call her a cab.
143,00:08:41,00:08:42,VARTANN: Around what time?
144,00:08:42,00:08:43,We were really slammed.
145,00:08:43,00:08:46,Maybe 2:00... 2:30.
146,00:08:46,00:08:47,Which cab company?
147,00:08:47,00:08:48,Lucky Cab.
148,00:08:48,00:08:50,"Well, that would explain why her car's still here."
149,00:08:50,00:08:51,Doesn't explain the gun.
150,00:08:56,00:08:57,(whispering): Thank you.
151,00:08:57,00:08:59,Why? Do I know you?
152,00:09:00,00:09:04,ROBBINS: I dug it out of the right frontal cortex.
153,00:09:04,00:09:08,The bullet lacerated the right occipital lobe.
154,00:09:09,00:09:16,"It crossed the mid-line, destroying the vital structures of the brain and bounced off the left frontal calvarium."
155,00:09:16,00:09:18,Hmm.
156,00:09:18,00:09:21,This is a .25 caliber.
157,00:09:21,00:09:22,"What, disappointed?"
158,00:09:22,00:09:24,We found a .22 in the victim's car.
159,00:09:24,00:09:26,This just ruled that out as the murder weapon.
160,00:09:26,00:09:27,So shoot me.
161,00:09:27,00:09:31,Stellate tear means close contact.
162,00:09:31,00:09:34,See the muzzle impression around the entrance wound?
163,00:09:38,00:09:40,This could help identify the firearm.
164,00:09:45,00:09:48,This is an unusual point of entry.
165,00:09:48,00:09:49,"Yeah, I measured the trajectory."
166,00:09:49,00:09:51,Ten to 15 degrees left of vertical.
167,00:09:51,00:09:53,Shooter would have to be standing over her.
168,00:09:53,00:09:56,"Which would make him a giant, except for this."
169,00:09:57,00:09:59,Abrasions on her knees.
170,00:10:02,00:10:05,So... maybe she was kneeling.
171,00:10:05,00:10:08,Begging for her life.
172,00:10:09,00:10:14,"SIDLE: So, Judge Wilson tells me I'd have better luck with a blue suit than a gray suit."
173,00:10:14,00:10:16,What is that? Do you think he meant that?
174,00:10:16,00:10:19,Do you think he was flirting with me or...?
175,00:10:19,00:10:21,I thought judges were supposed to be color blind.
176,00:10:21,00:10:22,"SIDLE: Yeah, right."
177,00:10:22,00:10:24,That's cute.
178,00:10:31,00:10:34,WILLOWS: I found some particulate on the jacket.
179,00:10:34,00:10:35,Not sure what it is.
180,00:10:35,00:10:36,I'll get it to Hodges.
181,00:10:36,00:10:42,"Pocket contents: credit card, car keys, lipstick and one matchbook."
182,00:10:45,00:10:46,Can I see that?
183,00:10:46,00:10:48,"There's no name, just a phone number."
184,00:10:50,00:10:52,Give me a call.
185,00:10:54,00:10:55,I'll have Vartann run it down.
186,00:10:57,00:11:00,"You know, I've got to go pick up Lindsey."
187,00:11:00,00:11:01,Could you cover for me?
188,00:11:01,00:11:02,Sure.
189,00:11:02,00:11:03,WILLOWS: Thanks.
190,00:11:03,00:11:25,"Tell her I said, ""Hey."" Lindsey!"
191,00:11:25,00:11:26,Yeah.
192,00:11:26,00:11:27,What happened to the trash?
193,00:11:27,00:11:29,"I took it out, like you always tell me to."
194,00:11:29,00:11:31,It's Thursday.
195,00:11:31,00:11:32,"Uh, hello, Mom, you okay?"
196,00:11:32,00:11:34,"Yeah, I'm great."
197,00:11:34,00:11:36,Are you sure about that?
198,00:11:36,00:11:39,"You want me to be the babysitter, but you want me to be deaf and blind, too?"
199,00:11:39,00:11:41,"Can't get into this now, Mother."
200,00:11:41,00:11:43,I'm in a jam. You haven't seen your daughter all week.
201,00:11:43,00:11:45,Save the sermon.
202,00:11:45,00:11:47,"I was a working mother, too, you know?"
203,00:11:47,00:11:50,(to herself): There but for the grace of God...
204,00:11:50,00:11:55,Don't just assume that my time means nothing to me.
205,00:11:55,00:11:56,Damn it. Catherine?
206,00:11:56,00:11:57,I threw something away. It's gone.
207,00:11:57,00:12:00,(cell phone rings) You're throwing more than you know away.
208,00:12:04,00:12:05,Yeah?
209,00:12:06,00:12:08,Uh...
210,00:12:08,00:12:09,"Yeah, just wait till I get there."
211,00:12:09,00:12:12,Yeah.
212,00:12:12,00:12:15,Mom... Go. Go.
213,00:12:15,00:12:18,I'll be here when you get back.
214,00:12:35,00:12:37,Results from Alice Granger's jacket.
215,00:12:37,00:12:40,"Found trace elements of iron, chromium, manganese and carbon."
216,00:12:40,00:12:41,Metals.
217,00:12:41,00:12:43,"More specific, automotive sheet metal."
218,00:12:43,00:12:47,The metallic balls would've been released into the air during the welding process.
219,00:12:47,00:12:49,(buzzing)
220,00:12:50,00:12:52,So you're saying our killer has metal balls?
221,00:12:52,00:12:55,Yes... maybe.
222,00:12:55,00:13:01,"Turns out that the victim worked in a car dealership, so she could've gotten metal balls on the job."
223,00:13:01,00:13:07,"And just in case you're wondering, working here, I'm developing them, too."
224,00:13:15,00:13:16,Yo.
225,00:13:16,00:13:18,Oh. What do you have for me?
226,00:13:18,00:13:22,Bullet is a .25 auto caliber Winchester full metal jacket.
227,00:13:22,00:13:25,You can't shoot .25s from a .22 caliber pistol.
228,00:13:25,00:13:26,I know.
229,00:13:26,00:13:30,Which means the semi-automatic you found in Alice Granger's car isn't the murder weapon.
230,00:13:30,00:13:31,I know.
231,00:13:31,00:13:35,"Okay, well, did you know that the gun is registered to a Douglas Granger?"
232,00:13:46,00:13:49,I don't understand why you're asking me this.
233,00:13:49,00:13:51,"I'm her brother, not her husband."
234,00:13:51,00:13:53,You still own a lot of guns.
235,00:13:53,00:13:56,"A .22 pistol, Colt .25, among others."
236,00:13:56,00:13:58,That's right.
237,00:13:58,00:14:00,We found the .22 in Alice's car.
238,00:14:00,00:14:01,(sighs)
239,00:14:02,00:14:06,"If she carried it in her purse instead of leaving it in the car, she might still be alive."
240,00:14:08,00:14:09,I don't follow.
241,00:14:09,00:14:11,I gave her the gun last week.
242,00:14:11,00:14:12,Then what?
243,00:14:12,00:14:13,You shot her with your .25?
244,00:14:13,00:14:14,Are you insane?
245,00:14:14,00:14:18,It's no mystery who killed her.
246,00:14:18,00:14:21,"Jeff Simon, her ex-boyfriend. Guy was stalking her."
247,00:14:21,00:14:26,"She changed her phone number, changed jobs, moved a half dozen times."
248,00:14:26,00:14:28,"No matter where she went, there he was."
249,00:14:28,00:14:30,"Last week, I was over at her new apartment."
250,00:14:30,00:14:33,"Jerk sitting in his car, in front of the building."
251,00:14:33,00:14:35,Is that when you gave her the gun?
252,00:14:35,00:14:36,(sighs)
253,00:14:36,00:14:38,Taught her how to shoot it.
254,00:14:38,00:14:40,Helped her get a restraining order.
255,00:14:40,00:14:42,Got zero help from you guys.
256,00:14:42,00:14:45,"""Catch him in the act."" That's all we heard."
257,00:14:45,00:14:46,You know where we can find Jeff Simon?
258,00:14:46,00:14:49,Yeah.
259,00:14:49,00:14:50,We used to be friends.
260,00:14:52,00:14:55,(distant tool buzzing)
261,00:15:06,00:15:09,(buzzing grows louder)
262,00:15:11,00:15:13,"Hey, I'm looking for Jeff Simon."
263,00:15:16,00:15:18,(loud buzzing)
264,00:15:19,00:15:21,(turns off saw)
265,00:15:23,00:15:24,Jeff Simon?
266,00:15:25,00:15:26,Are you Jeff Simon?
267,00:15:26,00:15:27,Yeah.
268,00:15:30,00:15:32,When's the last time you saw Alice Granger?
269,00:15:32,00:15:33,Before the restraining order kicked in.
270,00:15:33,00:15:35,Come on.
271,00:15:35,00:15:37,"This is just a big misunderstanding, Officer."
272,00:15:37,00:15:38,"Well, I'm glad you feel that way."
273,00:15:38,00:15:40,You mind if we take a look in your truck?
274,00:15:40,00:15:42,What did Alice say I did now?
275,00:15:42,00:15:43,Where is it?
276,00:15:49,00:15:51,I don't get a break for another half hour.
277,00:15:51,00:15:53,"Look, we can get a court order."
278,00:15:55,00:15:57,You can look anywhere you want.
279,00:15:57,00:16:00,Just give Alice a message for me.
280,00:16:00,00:16:02,"I love her, and I want her back."
281,00:16:06,00:16:08,"Look, buddy, she's dead."
282,00:16:23,00:16:27,What the...
283,00:16:27,00:16:30,"I swear, I haven't been..."
284,00:16:30,00:16:33,I haven't been anywhere near her since her brother broke us up.
285,00:16:35,00:16:37,I'm gonna check out his truck.
286,00:17:23,00:17:26,(beeping)
287,00:17:31,00:17:33,(speed dialing)
288,00:17:33,00:17:41,"Gil, the suspect has a laptop in his vehicle that has a GPS unit that's honed in on the lab."
289,00:17:41,00:17:44,"Well, you can't track a static location."
290,00:17:44,00:17:46,It has to be something mobile.
291,00:17:46,00:17:48,I know. That's why I'm calling.
292,00:18:33,00:18:35,(phone rings)
293,00:18:35,00:18:36,Yeah.
294,00:18:36,00:18:37,GRISSOM: You were right.
295,00:18:37,00:18:41,We found a GPS transmitter under the rear bumper of the girl's car.
296,00:18:41,00:18:43,Thanks.
297,00:18:46,00:18:48,He was tracking her car.
298,00:18:49,00:18:50,Let's bring him in.
299,00:18:52,00:18:53,Get up.
300,00:19:00,00:19:01,You are a real prize.
301,00:19:01,00:19:06,"Jeff, your prints are all over that box, which means one count felony stalking."
302,00:19:06,00:19:08,That's seven to ten.
303,00:19:08,00:19:11,Murder two adds a quarter.
304,00:19:11,00:19:15,"Now, you plead out now, you'll live to see parole."
305,00:19:15,00:19:16,I didn't kill Alice.
306,00:19:16,00:19:18,I loved her.
307,00:19:18,00:19:19,Is that your idea of love?
308,00:19:19,00:19:21,Stalking her with a GPS unit?
309,00:19:21,00:19:23,I wasn't stalking her.
310,00:19:23,00:19:24,I wo-worried about her.
311,00:19:24,00:19:27,So that restraining order she filed against you was because you're a nice guy.
312,00:19:27,00:19:30,Let me tell you about Alice.
313,00:19:30,00:19:32,She... liked to party...
314,00:19:35,00:19:43,"...barely ate, hardly slept, didn't want to admit she had a drinking problem."
315,00:19:44,00:19:47,She needed me to look out for her.
316,00:19:47,00:19:50,"Well, there's a problem with your story. She called a cab."
317,00:19:50,00:19:55,"I'm telling you, Alice got into a Chrysler or... a Buick?"
318,00:19:55,00:19:57,"It was blue, maybe black."
319,00:19:57,00:20:02,"And the guy she was with, maniac driver. Complete moron."
320,00:20:02,00:20:04,"Wait, wait. You... you followed them?"
321,00:20:06,00:20:08,I had to.
322,00:20:08,00:20:12,But I was pulled over by the cops.
323,00:20:12,00:20:16,They kept me on-on the side of the road for over an hour.
324,00:20:17,00:20:18,What time was this?
325,00:20:18,00:20:19,It was around 2:00.
326,00:20:19,00:20:20,It was a buck-fifty ticket.
327,00:20:20,00:20:21,I'm innocent.
328,00:20:22,00:20:23,Cut the crap.
329,00:20:23,00:20:26,We found trace amounts of automotive sheet metal on her clothing.
330,00:20:26,00:20:27,You work around cars.
331,00:20:27,00:20:30,"If Alice picked it up from you, you were in violation of the T.R.O."
332,00:20:30,00:20:33,"Lady, until we broke up, we spent every waking minute together."
333,00:20:33,00:20:36,She'd come over to my shop on her lunch break just to get some.
334,00:20:36,00:20:38,"It was over, Jeff."
335,00:20:38,00:20:40,"She didn't want you to be her lover, her protector."
336,00:20:40,00:20:43,She didn't want you within a hundred yards.
337,00:20:43,00:20:45,Whatever trace from you we found on her was fresh.
338,00:20:45,00:20:47,"She worked around cars, too."
339,00:20:47,00:20:50,"I'm telling you, I'm innocent!"
340,00:20:50,00:20:53,"You were living a fantasy, thinking you still had a chance."
341,00:20:53,00:20:55,"When reality set in, you killed her."
342,00:20:55,00:20:58,I only did one thing wrong.
343,00:20:59,00:21:02,I didn't protect her from that guy.
344,00:21:02,00:21:04,What did this guy look like?
345,00:21:04,00:21:06,Sleazy bastard.
346,00:21:06,00:21:08,"Slight build, dark hair."
347,00:21:08,00:21:11,I think he had a leather jacket.
348,00:21:14,00:21:18,(chuckling)
349,00:21:30,00:21:31,GRISSOM: Okay.
350,00:21:31,00:21:32,Do you have a minute?
351,00:21:32,00:21:34,I got a problem in DNA.
352,00:21:34,00:21:37,"WILLOWS: Okay, uh, it really is only gonna take a minute."
353,00:21:37,00:21:40,"Um, I just need to have a conversation with you."
354,00:21:40,00:21:42,(sighs)
355,00:21:42,00:21:46,I processed the swabs from the wife who found her husband in the hooker case.
356,00:21:46,00:21:47,Right.
357,00:21:47,00:21:49,Two contributions.
358,00:21:49,00:21:50,Two?
359,00:21:50,00:21:52,One was a match to the wife's DNA.
360,00:21:52,00:21:54,The other was from an unknown male.
361,00:21:54,00:21:58,I found the same unknown male contribution on the swabs from the Alice Granger homicide.
362,00:21:58,00:22:00,"Well, it's unlikely that they're connected. They're not."
363,00:22:00,00:22:04,I also matched that unknown male contribution to a rape kit from the day shift.
364,00:22:04,00:22:05,Cross contamination?
365,00:22:05,00:22:07,That's why I raised the alarm.
366,00:22:07,00:22:10,I was able to narrow the time frame to the last 48 hours.
367,00:22:10,00:22:14,Are you saying that all the DNA evidence from the last two days has to be resubmitted and retested?
368,00:22:14,00:22:15,We don't have any choice.
369,00:22:15,00:22:18,It's potentially all contaminated.
370,00:22:18,00:22:20,Document everything.
371,00:22:27,00:22:31,"Hey. Your suspect, Jeff Simon, just got released from custody."
372,00:22:34,00:22:36,How the hell did that happen?
373,00:22:36,00:22:37,His alibi checked out.
374,00:22:37,00:22:43,"I talked to the cop who pulled him over for speeding, at 2:15 a.m., right around T.O.D."
375,00:22:43,00:22:44,It's proof he lost track of her.
376,00:22:44,00:22:46,They jammed him for over an hour.
377,00:22:46,00:22:50,"I mean, made him walk the line, gave him a breathalyzer, the whole nine. Guy confessed to stalking."
378,00:22:51,00:22:52,At least you got him on that.
379,00:22:52,00:22:56,Which they'll probably kick down to a misdemeanor because she's dead.
380,00:22:56,00:22:59,Hey. Phone number on the matchbook panned out.
381,00:22:59,00:23:00,Guy's on his way to P.D.
382,00:23:01,00:23:03,You got a name?
383,00:23:06,00:23:08,Was it necessary to show up at my office?
384,00:23:08,00:23:09,Try the phone.
385,00:23:10,00:23:11,I'm an officer of the court.
386,00:23:11,00:23:14,Mr. Novak...
387,00:23:14,00:23:16,do you recognize this telephone number?
388,00:23:16,00:23:18,That's my work number.
389,00:23:18,00:23:20,Did you write it on the matchbook?
390,00:23:20,00:23:22,I may have. What's this about?
391,00:23:22,00:23:23,A homicide.
392,00:23:23,00:23:26,That matchbook was found in a dead woman's pocket.
393,00:23:28,00:23:30,This the only evidence linking me to the victim?
394,00:23:30,00:23:33,This will go much easier if you just answer our questions.
395,00:23:33,00:23:35,"Oh, yeah? Easier for whom?"
396,00:23:35,00:23:36,Why didn't you write your name on it?
397,00:23:36,00:23:38,I'm a memorable guy.
398,00:23:38,00:23:40,Why not your home number?
399,00:23:40,00:23:41,This is getting tedious.
400,00:23:41,00:23:44,"At bars, I give out my work number to weed out the crazies."
401,00:23:47,00:23:50,This is Alice Granger.
402,00:23:50,00:23:51,Do you know her?
403,00:23:54,00:23:57,I bought her a drink last night.
404,00:23:58,00:24:03,"VARTANN: Okay, why don't you, uh, walk us through your evening?"
405,00:24:03,00:24:07,"Start with ""I left the office..."" I was deposing a witness."
406,00:24:07,00:24:08,Left the office late.
407,00:24:08,00:24:11,Stopped at the Peppermill for a burger.
408,00:24:11,00:24:12,Medium rare.
409,00:24:12,00:24:13,No onions.
410,00:24:13,00:24:15,Got to The Highball around 11:00.
411,00:24:17,00:24:18,Met this redhead.
412,00:24:18,00:24:20,Bought her a drink and...
413,00:24:24,00:24:25,(clearing throat)
414,00:24:25,00:24:27,Mr. Novak...
415,00:24:27,00:24:30,I'm Catherine Willows.
416,00:24:30,00:24:32,CSI.
417,00:24:35,00:24:38,You want to know what happened next?
418,00:24:38,00:24:40,Ask the redhead.
419,00:24:47,00:24:51,"At a bar that time of night, we're all after the same thing, aren't we?"
420,00:24:51,00:24:53,I came onto her.
421,00:24:53,00:24:55,She was into me.
422,00:24:55,00:25:00,"I know when a woman is going to give way and believe me, she wasthere."
423,00:25:00,00:25:02,And then what?
424,00:25:03,00:25:05,I walked her out.
425,00:25:06,00:25:07,I put my arm around her waist.
426,00:25:07,00:25:10,She moved in.
427,00:25:10,00:25:12,One minute she's got her tongue down my throat.
428,00:25:12,00:25:15,"The next, she puts on the brakes."
429,00:25:15,00:25:17,She's a bitch and a tease.
430,00:25:20,00:25:23,We should ask for his clothes.
431,00:25:23,00:25:27,"Black leather jacket, black T-shirt, jeans."
432,00:25:28,00:25:32,"What else should we ask him, Catherine?"
433,00:25:32,00:25:34,This is what I was trying to tell you.
434,00:25:34,00:25:37,"Yeah, but you didn't, so now I'm way behind."
435,00:25:38,00:25:40,Is he telling the truth?
436,00:25:43,00:25:46,He's not lying about anything that pertains to me.
437,00:25:49,00:25:50,He hit you.
438,00:25:50,00:25:53,"No, it was an accident."
439,00:25:54,00:26:03,"But... by the time it happened, he wasn't who I thought he was, and..."
440,00:26:03,00:26:04,that scared me.
441,00:26:08,00:26:12,VARTANN: Eyewitness claimed that a man matching your description left the bar with the victim.
442,00:26:12,00:26:17,"Drove off in a dark-colored, four-door sedan."
443,00:26:17,00:26:19,"What do you drive, Mr. Novak?"
444,00:26:19,00:26:25,"Look, I'm innocent, but it's in my best interest to retain counsel."
445,00:26:25,00:26:27,We're done here.
446,00:26:34,00:26:39,You have to recuse yourself from processing evidence This guy's a lawyer.
447,00:26:39,00:26:40,He could claim prejudicial treatment.
448,00:26:40,00:26:43,Your whole life will become public record.
449,00:26:43,00:26:44,I have nothing to be ashamed of.
450,00:26:44,00:26:46,"We all live in glass houses, Catherine."
451,00:26:46,00:26:48,You gotta be careful where you take your shower.
452,00:26:51,00:26:52,Catherine.
453,00:26:56,00:27:00,Just walk me through your interaction with the suspect.
454,00:27:00,00:27:04,I met Adam Novak in a bar called The Highball.
455,00:27:04,00:27:06,Were you drinking?
456,00:27:06,00:27:09,"I had one cocktail, on his tab."
457,00:27:09,00:27:11,He walked me out to my car.
458,00:27:11,00:27:13,Things got physical.
459,00:27:13,00:27:15,"Could you define ""physical""?"
460,00:27:15,00:27:19,I believe that I outlined the specifics in my memo.
461,00:27:19,00:27:22,"Catherine, you know what I'm asking, and it's not in the memo."
462,00:27:23,00:27:26,"I didn't have sex with him, though he clearly wanted it."
463,00:27:26,00:27:27,And you didn't?
464,00:27:29,00:27:31,I went out after shift to unwind.
465,00:27:31,00:27:34,I even invited Warrick and Nick to come along.
466,00:27:34,00:27:35,They had other plans.
467,00:27:35,00:27:42,"All right. So... when you put on the brakes, Mr. Novak... got angry."
468,00:27:43,00:27:45,Yeah.
469,00:27:45,00:27:47,I got into my car.
470,00:27:47,00:27:48,He went back inside.
471,00:27:59,00:28:02,"Hey, El, will you do me a favor and call me a cab?"
472,00:28:02,00:28:03,Thanks.
473,00:28:06,00:28:09,"This is just a theory, but..."
474,00:28:09,00:28:14,"she was drunk, probably more compliant than I was."
475,00:28:14,00:28:16,He walked her outside.
476,00:28:16,00:28:21,"He waited with her for the taxi, offered her a ride."
477,00:28:21,00:28:22,BROWN: I hate to break up the party.
478,00:28:22,00:28:25,"Catherine, you got a 419 in Seven Hills."
479,00:28:25,00:28:27,I'll grab the kits and meet you outside.
480,00:28:30,00:28:31,We'll finish this later?
481,00:28:31,00:28:33,Guess we'll have to.
482,00:28:45,00:28:47,Look familiar?
483,00:28:47,00:28:49,Yeah.
484,00:28:49,00:28:50,Like the other night.
485,00:28:50,00:28:53,You got an I.D. on the vic?
486,00:28:53,00:28:55,"Yeah. Holly Pearson, 31, single."
487,00:28:55,00:28:56,She lived across the street.
488,00:28:56,00:28:58,Car was locked.
489,00:28:59,00:29:00,Keys and purse were accounted for.
490,00:29:00,00:29:03,Found them in the mailbox along with her mail.
491,00:29:03,00:29:05,WARRICK: Any indication of sexual assault?
492,00:29:05,00:29:08,"Well, her clothes and underwear are undisturbed."
493,00:29:08,00:29:09,Can you remove the jacket?
494,00:29:09,00:29:10,Sure.
495,00:29:19,00:29:22,Looks like a small-caliber gunshot wound...
496,00:29:22,00:29:23,like the first victim.
497,00:29:23,00:29:26,Location of the entry wound is different.
498,00:29:29,00:29:31,Slug's still inside her.
499,00:29:35,00:29:37,Grave is working a case with similarities.
500,00:29:37,00:29:44,That victim left a bar called The Highball shortly before she was killed.
501,00:29:44,00:29:47,I'm wondering if Holly went out last night.
502,00:29:47,00:29:48,I'm on it.
503,00:29:50,00:29:51,Thanks.
504,00:30:00,00:30:02,There's two sets of shoe prints...
505,00:30:04,00:30:06,With a bit of distance between the strides.
506,00:30:07,00:30:09,Which means they were both running.
507,00:30:14,00:30:16,BROWN: Got some shell casings.
508,00:30:17,00:30:20,"Well, there's only one shot fired in Grissom's case."
509,00:30:21,00:30:22,It was close contact.
510,00:30:22,00:30:23,He couldn't miss.
511,00:30:23,00:30:26,I'm thinking that she was attacked near her house...
512,00:30:27,00:30:29,and then made a run for it.
513,00:30:34,00:30:35,(gunshots)
514,00:30:51,00:30:54,Got a courthouse keycard.
515,00:30:54,00:30:58,For the parking lot.
516,00:30:58,00:31:00,I wonder where Holly Pearson works.
517,00:31:00,00:31:02,Adam Novak's a public defender.
518,00:31:02,00:31:05,Let's run his prints against this.
519,00:31:05,00:31:09,Guys? I found a couple of the victim's coworkers.
520,00:31:09,00:31:10,They said she was at The Highball last night.
521,00:31:10,00:31:12,Got them coming into PD.
522,00:31:13,00:31:15,Holly was just promoted.
523,00:31:17,00:31:22,Youngest systems analyst at the bank and we were celebrating.
524,00:31:22,00:31:26,She wasn't exactly a party animal.
525,00:31:26,00:31:29,We practically forced her to go out.
526,00:31:29,00:31:32,Any guys come on strong?
527,00:31:32,00:31:35,Yeah. We collected numbers all night.
528,00:31:35,00:31:39,Anyone write their number on a matchbook?
529,00:31:39,00:31:43,"I got, uh... business cards."
530,00:31:43,00:31:47,So... you're having a good time and...
531,00:31:47,00:31:49,Holly had had enough.
532,00:31:49,00:31:54,"Yeah. We carpooled, so she took a cab home."
533,00:31:55,00:31:57,I'd like to show you some pictures.
534,00:31:57,00:32:01,See if you recognize anyone.
535,00:32:02,00:32:03,(sniffles)
536,00:32:14,00:32:15,He bought us a round.
537,00:32:17,00:32:19,He tried to get friendly.
538,00:32:19,00:32:21,"When Holly left, did you see that man again?"
539,00:32:23,00:32:25,"Actually, no."
540,00:32:31,00:32:33,"Hell of a backlog, here, Doc."
541,00:32:33,00:32:36,Yeah. Traffic pile-up on I-15.
542,00:32:36,00:32:38,Holly Pearson?
543,00:32:38,00:32:39,Mm.
544,00:32:43,00:32:46,C.O.D.'s a one shot to the back of the head.
545,00:32:46,00:32:50,Absence of gun powder and stippling suggests a non-contact wound.
546,00:32:50,00:32:52,Dug this out.
547,00:32:56,00:32:57,.25 caliber.
548,00:32:57,00:32:59,It's the same as the first victim.
549,00:32:59,00:33:02,"You know, I got something you might find interesting."
550,00:33:02,00:33:05,I emptied the stomach and she hadn't eaten for hours.
551,00:33:05,00:33:12,"A small amount of white zinfandel-- Less than a glass, vintage undetermined, and a tiny scrap of meat."
552,00:33:12,00:33:13,Take a look.
553,00:33:17,00:33:20,Surface tissue of a human tongue.
554,00:33:20,00:33:21,Those are the taste buds.
555,00:33:21,00:33:23,She bit her attacker...
556,00:33:23,00:33:25,when he tried to kiss her.
557,00:33:26,00:33:29,This woman did not go gently into that good night.
558,00:33:43,00:33:45,Heard you may be looking at a second victim?
559,00:33:45,00:33:46,Yeah.
560,00:33:46,00:33:50,Bullets from both homicides are from the same gun.
561,00:33:50,00:33:52,I just got off the phone with Courthouse Security.
562,00:33:52,00:33:57,That keycard that you and Catherine found belongs a guy named Adam Novak.
563,00:33:57,00:33:59,Only prints I found on the card were his.
564,00:33:59,00:34:01,"Well, let's call PD and bring him in."
565,00:34:36,00:34:38,"Mom, Lindsey, go inside the house."
566,00:34:39,00:34:47,"Believe it or not, Catherine does know how to say, ""Hello, how are you? Would you like a cup of coffee?"" I was talking to your mother about the case we're working."
567,00:34:47,00:34:48,"Mom, we're fine."
568,00:34:48,00:34:49,Take Lindsey inside.
569,00:34:53,00:34:55,Let's go.
570,00:34:55,00:34:57,"I don't, I don't want to."
571,00:34:57,00:34:58,Lindsey.
572,00:34:58,00:35:00,Are you going to go out again?
573,00:35:00,00:35:01,No. I'm coming in.
574,00:35:01,00:35:02,I want to hear about your day.
575,00:35:04,00:35:06,It was a pleasure meeting you.
576,00:35:10,00:35:11,What the hell are you doing here?
577,00:35:11,00:35:15,"I want to know why you're setting me up, manipulating evidence to make me look guilty."
578,00:35:15,00:35:16,All because I came on too strong?
579,00:35:16,00:35:17,I want you out of here.
580,00:35:17,00:35:18,I didn't get my signals crossed.
581,00:35:19,00:35:21,"You changed the play, and you're screaming foul."
582,00:35:21,00:35:22,"That's some power trip, babe."
583,00:35:22,00:35:24,Who's the guilty one here?
584,00:35:24,00:35:25,"You want to talk to me, call your lawyer."
585,00:35:25,00:35:27,Set up an appointment down at PD.
586,00:35:27,00:35:28,You think I killed her?
587,00:35:28,00:35:29,Back off.
588,00:35:30,00:35:31,You going to shoot me?
589,00:35:31,00:35:32,If you take one more step.
590,00:35:32,00:35:35,(siren wailing)
591,00:35:35,00:35:36,You bitch.
592,00:35:37,00:35:39,You came to my house.
593,00:35:43,00:35:45,"GRISSOM: Mr. Novak, would you stick out your tongue, please?"
594,00:35:45,00:35:46,What is this about?
595,00:35:47,00:35:49,"Well, right now, it's about his tongue."
596,00:35:49,00:35:50,And two dead women.
597,00:35:50,00:35:54,"We believe the second victim, Holly Pearson, bit her attacker's tongue."
598,00:35:54,00:35:56,"Open up, please."
599,00:36:02,00:36:04,Uh-uh. Once more.
600,00:36:09,00:36:11,Thank you. That's all I need.
601,00:36:13,00:36:14,Have a seat.
602,00:36:22,00:36:24,You comfortable? We're going to be a while.
603,00:36:24,00:36:26,I know how this looks.
604,00:36:26,00:36:27,"Adam, I..."
605,00:36:27,00:36:30,I advise some of the stupidest guys that come through this room.
606,00:36:30,00:36:32,And it's my job is to keep their mouths shut.
607,00:36:32,00:36:36,And I know what you're thinking-- that I killed Alice Granger.
608,00:36:37,00:36:39,(whimpers)
609,00:36:40,00:36:41,(gunshot)
610,00:36:44,00:36:47,You're a mind reader.
611,00:36:47,00:36:49,I already admitted that I picked her up at a bar the other night.
612,00:36:49,00:36:54,"What I didn't mention, and you didn't ask was that I gave her a ride home."
613,00:36:54,00:36:58,It got hot and heavy.
614,00:36:58,00:37:00,We both got what we needed.
615,00:37:00,00:37:04,Then she said good night and got out of the car.
616,00:37:04,00:37:05,I drove off.
617,00:37:05,00:37:10,"Uh, Do you have any evidence at all that refutes my client's account, or suggests otherwise?"
618,00:37:10,00:37:18,"Our evidence pertains to the second victim, killed last night with the same gun, and we believe that a portion of your client's tongue was in her stomach."
619,00:37:18,00:37:19,I can explain that.
620,00:37:19,00:37:20,Oh? Really.
621,00:37:20,00:37:22,Her taxi never showed up.
622,00:37:22,00:37:26,I was drunk. Out of line.
623,00:37:27,00:37:29,"Bad couple of days, thanks to you guys."
624,00:37:29,00:37:33,I was looking for a little release and I chose the wrong girl.
625,00:37:33,00:37:35,And what happened next?
626,00:37:35,00:37:36,Her taxi finally showed up.
627,00:37:36,00:37:42,"I spoke to both the bartender at The Highball and the cab company, and a cab was ordered and drove the victim home."
628,00:37:42,00:37:48,"Mr. Novak, have you ever been to Holly Pearson's house?"
629,00:37:48,00:37:51,No. I have no idea where she lived.
630,00:37:51,00:37:54,Then how do you explain your courthouse keycard which we found near her body?
631,00:37:54,00:37:59,CSI matched the prints on the card. Only yours.
632,00:37:59,00:38:02,Every attorney in the Public Defenders Office is issued one card.
633,00:38:02,00:38:05,Mine has never left my car.
634,00:38:05,00:38:06,I keep it in the center console.
635,00:38:06,00:38:07,You don't need a warrant.
636,00:38:07,00:38:09,You have my permission to check.
637,00:38:09,00:38:10,It should be there.
638,00:38:10,00:38:13,"Well, that won't be hard to verify, because your car's already at CSI."
639,00:38:19,00:38:20,Nick.
640,00:38:20,00:38:21,Hey.
641,00:38:21,00:38:23,The center console.
642,00:38:23,00:38:25,Was there a parking lot car key inside?
643,00:38:25,00:38:27,No. Two sticks of gum and a pack of condoms.
644,00:38:27,00:38:29,Why?
645,00:38:29,00:38:35,Suspect claims some incriminating evidence found at the second crime scene wasn't his.
646,00:38:35,00:38:37,It looks like he was lying.
647,00:38:37,00:38:38,We got him.
648,00:38:38,00:38:44,"I don't know how you're going to take this, but I think this car was recently broken into."
649,00:38:44,00:38:46,These scratches...
650,00:38:46,00:38:47,they look fresh.
651,00:38:47,00:38:49,B&amp;E 101.
652,00:38:50,00:38:52,The Slim Jim.
653,00:38:59,00:39:02,Somebody could've swiped his keycard.
654,00:39:02,00:39:04,And then locked the car back up.
655,00:39:05,00:39:08,Novak wouldn't be the wiser until he drove into the courthouse again.
656,00:39:08,00:39:10,Did you find any prints?
657,00:39:10,00:39:13,"Smudges and partials, inside and out."
658,00:39:14,00:39:16,Run 'em.
659,00:39:28,00:39:31,(soft electronic chirping)
660,00:39:31,00:39:32,(beep)
661,00:39:37,00:39:40,(metal grinding)
662,00:39:40,00:39:43,Let's run through the night Alice died again.
663,00:39:43,00:39:44,We've been through this.
664,00:39:44,00:39:45,I have an alibi.
665,00:39:45,00:39:47,Your alibi only proves you lost track of her.
666,00:39:47,00:39:49,You knew where Alice lived.
667,00:39:49,00:39:51,Have you been in Adam Novak's car recently?
668,00:39:51,00:39:55,No. I don't even know an Adam Novak.
669,00:39:55,00:39:58,But you identified his vehicle as the car that Alice left the bar in.
670,00:39:58,00:39:59,I didn't know whose car it was.
671,00:39:59,00:40:00,Then why did we find your prints in it?
672,00:40:03,00:40:06,Maybe somebody's trying to frame me.
673,00:40:06,00:40:08,"No, but I think that you're familiar with the concept."
674,00:40:10,00:40:18,"You were obsessed with Alice, and when you saw Adam having at her, you flipped out."
675,00:40:23,00:40:30,"I mean, here's a woman that you can't get any traction with, yet she's willing to do a stranger she picked up in a bar."
676,00:40:53,00:40:58,"I mean, lucky for you, The Highball was Adam's second home."
677,00:40:58,00:41:04,"The next night, you came back and saw his car in the parking lot."
678,00:41:04,00:41:06,Creative justice. You could get them both.
679,00:41:06,00:41:13,It was just bad luck that Holly Pearson met Adam that night.
680,00:41:13,00:41:21,"You had no reason to kill her, but you followed her home and worked up the nerve."
681,00:41:42,00:41:45,"You made one mistake, though."
682,00:41:45,00:41:50,The evidence that you used to frame him brought us back to you.
683,00:41:58,00:42:00,You figured out the source of the contamination?
684,00:42:00,00:42:04,I got a positive result off my negative control.
685,00:42:04,00:42:05,Matched the contamination.
686,00:42:05,00:42:14,Turns out somebody at the manufacturer forgot to put on their mask and then sneezed or coughed on what was supposed to be a sterile product.
687,00:42:14,00:42:16,You have to collect everyone's swabs.
688,00:42:16,00:42:18,Kits. Trucks. Vests.
689,00:42:18,00:42:19,Work stations.
690,00:42:19,00:42:21,How long till the new shipment gets here?
691,00:42:21,00:42:24,"It's on its way. Until then, do it old school."
692,00:42:28,00:42:30,Gil.
693,00:42:33,00:42:39,"I'd ask you out for a drink, but under the circumstances, it's, uh..."
694,00:42:41,00:42:43,"Okay, how long is this going to go on?"
695,00:42:43,00:42:46,"I don't know, Catherine."
696,00:42:47,00:42:49,"Gil, it was an act of omission."
697,00:42:49,00:42:53,How many times have we heard a public defender say that?
698,00:42:54,00:42:56,I went out after work.
699,00:42:56,00:42:59,Is it a crime to want a little human contact?
700,00:42:59,00:43:01,I guess that's why I don't go out.
