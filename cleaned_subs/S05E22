0	00:00:20	00:00:21	Hi.
1	00:00:21	00:00:22	Hey.
2	00:00:22	00:00:25	Husband and wife got into it.
3	00:00:25	00:00:26	Hmm.
4	00:00:26	00:00:27	Hmm.
5	00:00:27	00:00:28	What set them off?
6	00:00:28	00:00:30	She caught him with a hooker in their bed.
7	00:00:30	00:00:31	She cut him.
8	00:00:31	00:00:33	He killed her.
9	00:00:33	00:00:34	What about the hooker?
10	00:00:34	00:00:36	She grabbed his wallet and took off.
11	00:00:36	00:00:38	I caught the guy just sitting on a curb.
12	00:00:38	00:00:39	I swabbed his hands for blood spatter.
13	00:00:39	00:00:42	I am super backed up.
14	00:00:42	00:00:43	Can this wait till tomorrow?
15	00:00:43	00:00:45	He's not going anywhere.
16	00:00:45	00:00:48	Thanks, Mia.
17	00:00:48	00:00:49	Yeah...
18	00:00:49	00:00:51	Oh, hey, guys.
19	00:00:51	00:00:52	I could really use a drink.
20	00:00:52	00:00:54	You want to join me? I'm buying.
21	00:00:54	00:00:56	I'd love a drink, but we made plans, though?
22	00:00:56	00:00:57	You did?
23	00:00:57	00:00:58	Tomorrow. Rain check.
24	00:00:58	00:00:59	All right.
25	00:00:59	00:01:01	Rain check.
26	00:01:01	00:01:03	Okay.
27	00:01:15	00:01:17	No way you were never married.
28	00:01:17	00:01:18	Oh, let me guess.
29	00:01:18	00:01:26	You were young, he seemed more mature than he really was, he swept you off your feet, and, uh, he let you fall.
30	00:01:26	00:01:29	Bruised, but not broken.
31	00:01:29	00:01:31	Get you another one?
32	00:01:31	00:01:34	No, I'm good, thanks.
33	00:01:35	00:01:37	So you're divorced?
34	00:01:41	00:01:43	You?
35	00:01:43	00:01:44	Yeah.
36	00:01:44	00:01:47	She seemed more mature than she really was, swept me off my feet.
37	00:01:48	00:01:49	Kids?
38	00:01:49	00:01:53	Uh, yes, I have a daughter.
39	00:01:53	00:01:56	If she's got her mother's looks, you're in trouble.
40	00:02:06	00:02:08	If I don't get home soon, I will be in trouble.
41	00:02:12	00:02:13	Thanks. I needed this.
42	00:02:14	00:02:16	If you're blowing me off, no worries.
43	00:02:16	00:02:18	But if you're not...
44	00:02:23	00:02:24	...give me a call.
45	00:02:30	00:02:31	Wait a second.
46	00:02:31	00:02:33	Let me walk you to your car.
47	00:02:44	00:02:46	I can't do this tonight. I...
48	00:02:46	00:02:48	I'll call you.
49	00:02:49	00:02:51	What the hell is your problem?
50	00:02:56	00:02:58	Go to hell.
51	00:03:04	00:03:06	You're not worth the trouble.
52	00:03:25	00:03:28	Hello.
53	00:03:28	00:03:31	Mom, Mom.
54	00:03:31	00:03:32	Grissom just called. I've got to go in.
55	00:03:33	00:03:34	I'm backing up grave.
56	00:03:34	00:03:35	( sniffs ) What?
57	00:03:35	00:03:38	Vodka, with an Altoid chaser.
58	00:03:38	00:03:40	I brushed my teeth.
59	00:03:40	00:03:44	What did you do, walk into a door?
60	00:03:44	00:03:48	Hey, listen, Lindsey's got a dentist appointment before school.
61	00:03:48	00:03:50	I wrote all the information down in the kitchen.
62	00:03:50	00:03:52	Okay. Okay?
63	00:03:52	00:03:53	Thank you.
64	00:03:53	00:03:55	Oh, good grief.
65	00:04:15	00:04:17	I appreciate this.
66	00:04:17	00:04:18	Everyone's out.
67	00:04:18	00:04:19	I'm short.
68	00:04:19	00:04:22	You're welcome.
69	00:04:24	00:04:26	Clotted blood hasn't retracted yet.
70	00:04:26	00:04:28	She hasn't been dead long.
71	00:04:28	00:04:29	We have an I.D.?
72	00:04:29	00:04:32	Yeah, building manager took a peek.
73	00:04:32	00:04:34	ID'd her as Alice Granger.
74	00:04:34	00:04:35	Apartment 207.
75	00:04:35	00:04:37	Moved here about a month ago.
76	00:04:37	00:04:41	David, you want to take the, uh, jacket off her face?
77	00:04:54	00:04:55	What happened to you?
78	00:04:55	00:04:57	I walked into a door.
79	00:04:57	00:04:59	Can we not talk about it?
80	00:05:01	00:05:02	Gunshot.
81	00:05:03	00:05:05	Looks like a small caliber weapon.
82	00:05:07	00:05:09	No cartridge casings.
83	00:05:10	00:05:12	No purse, no car.
84	00:05:12	00:05:13	I put out a BOLO.
85	00:05:13	00:05:14	Possible car jacking.
86	00:05:23	00:05:27	Usually when a killer covers the victim's face, it suggests familiarity.
87	00:05:27	00:05:29	An act of contrition.
88	00:05:33	00:05:35	Maybe she knew her attacker.
89	00:05:35	00:05:38	Great. Carjacked by a friend.
90	00:05:39	00:05:42	Vartann.
91	00:05:42	00:05:43	Yeah, got it.
92	00:05:43	00:05:45	We got a 20 on her car.
93	00:05:45	00:05:48	You go, I'll stay with the body, I'll meet you there.
94	00:06:11	00:06:12	You see anybody get out of the car?
95	00:06:12	00:06:14	No, sir. Saw it on patrol.
96	00:06:14	00:06:16	You checked the bar? I waited for you.
97	00:06:16	00:06:17	No one's exited since we got here.
98	00:06:17	00:06:19	Okay, I'll see you inside.
99	00:06:23	00:06:25	Can you open it up?
100	00:06:34	00:06:36	Thank you.
101	00:06:52	00:06:55	I found a gun under the seat.
102	00:06:56	00:06:59	.22 Beretta.
103	00:06:59	00:07:01	Well, that's small enough to be the weapon.
104	00:07:01	00:07:06	So he shoots her, takes her car, and stops off for a drink.
105	00:07:06	00:07:07	He could still be in there.
106	00:07:09	00:07:11	Let's find out.
107	00:07:14	00:07:18	Did you hear the one about the cop and the monkey who walk into a bar?
108	00:07:18	00:07:20	I'm not in the mood.
109	00:07:20	00:07:22	Neither was the monkey.
110	00:08:16	00:08:18	Except for the Saturn, all the cars in the lot are accounted for.
111	00:08:18	00:08:20	Okay.
112	00:08:22	00:08:23	Hi. You recognize this girl?
113	00:08:24	00:08:27	Yeah. She's been in a few times. How about last night?
114	00:08:27	00:08:28	Yeah.
115	00:08:29	00:08:31	Throwing them back pretty good, too.
116	00:08:31	00:08:32	You see anybody hassle her?
117	00:08:32	00:08:34	She was getting a lot of attention.
118	00:08:34	00:08:36	She didn't really seem to mind.
119	00:08:36	00:08:38	Did you see her leave with anyone?
120	00:08:38	00:08:39	No. She was wasted.
121	00:08:39	00:08:41	Had me call her a cab.
122	00:08:41	00:08:42	Around what time?
123	00:08:42	00:08:43	We were really slammed.
124	00:08:43	00:08:47	00... 2 Which cab company?
125	00:08:47	00:08:48	Lucky Cab.
126	00:08:48	00:08:50	Well, that would explain why her car's still here.
127	00:08:50	00:08:51	Doesn't explain the gun.
128	00:08:56	00:08:57	Thank you.
129	00:08:57	00:08:59	Why? Do I know you?
130	00:09:00	00:09:04	I dug it out of the right frontal cortex.
131	00:09:04	00:09:08	The bullet lacerated the right occipital lobe.
132	00:09:09	00:09:16	It crossed the mid-line, destroying the vital structures of the brain and bounced off the left frontal calvarium.
133	00:09:16	00:09:18	Hmm.
134	00:09:18	00:09:21	This is a .25 caliber.
135	00:09:21	00:09:22	What, disappointed?
136	00:09:22	00:09:24	We found a .22 in the victim's car.
137	00:09:24	00:09:26	This just ruled that out as the murder weapon.
138	00:09:26	00:09:27	So shoot me.
139	00:09:27	00:09:31	Stellate tear means close contact.
140	00:09:31	00:09:34	See the muzzle impression around the entrance wound?
141	00:09:38	00:09:40	This could help identify the firearm.
142	00:09:45	00:09:48	This is an unusual point of entry.
143	00:09:48	00:09:49	Yeah, I measured the trajectory.
144	00:09:49	00:09:51	Ten to 15 degrees left of vertical.
145	00:09:51	00:09:53	Shooter would have to be standing over her.
146	00:09:53	00:09:56	Which would make him a giant, except for this.
147	00:09:57	00:09:59	Abrasions on her knees.
148	00:10:02	00:10:05	So... maybe she was kneeling.
149	00:10:05	00:10:08	Begging for her life.
150	00:10:09	00:10:14	So, Judge Wilson tells me I'd have better luck with a blue suit than a gray suit.
151	00:10:14	00:10:16	What is that? Do you think he meant that?
152	00:10:16	00:10:19	Do you think he was flirting with me or...?
153	00:10:19	00:10:21	I thought judges were supposed to be color blind.
154	00:10:21	00:10:22	Yeah, right.
155	00:10:22	00:10:24	That's cute.
156	00:10:31	00:10:34	I found some particulate on the jacket.
157	00:10:34	00:10:35	Not sure what it is.
158	00:10:35	00:10:36	I'll get it to Hodges.
159	00:10:38	00:10:42	credit card, car keys, lipstick and one matchbook.
160	00:10:45	00:10:46	Can I see that?
161	00:10:46	00:10:48	There's no name, just a phone number.
162	00:10:50	00:10:52	Give me a call.
163	00:10:54	00:10:55	I'll have Vartann run it down.
164	00:10:57	00:11:00	You know, I've got to go pick up Lindsey.
165	00:11:00	00:11:01	Could you cover for me?
166	00:11:01	00:11:02	Sure.
167	00:11:02	00:11:03	Thanks.
168	00:11:03	00:11:05	Tell her I said, Hey.
169	00:11:23	00:11:25	Lindsey!
170	00:11:25	00:11:26	Yeah.
171	00:11:26	00:11:27	What happened to the trash?
172	00:11:27	00:11:29	I took it out, like you always tell me to.
173	00:11:29	00:11:31	It's Thursday.
174	00:11:31	00:11:32	Uh, hello, Mom, you okay?
175	00:11:32	00:11:34	Yeah, I'm great.
176	00:11:34	00:11:36	Are you sure about that?
177	00:11:36	00:11:39	You want me to be the babysitter, but you want me to be deaf and blind, too?
178	00:11:39	00:11:41	Can't get into this now, Mother.
179	00:11:41	00:11:43	I'm in a jam. You haven't seen your daughter all week.
180	00:11:43	00:11:45	Save the sermon.
181	00:11:45	00:11:47	I was a working mother, too, you know?
182	00:11:47	00:11:50	There but for the grace of God...
183	00:11:50	00:11:55	Don't just assume that my time means nothing to me.
184	00:11:55	00:11:56	Damn it. Catherine?
185	00:11:56	00:11:57	I threw something away. It's gone.
186	00:11:57	00:12:00	( cell phone rings ) You're throwing more than you know away.
187	00:12:04	00:12:05	Yeah?
188	00:12:06	00:12:08	Uh...
189	00:12:08	00:12:09	Yeah, just wait till I get there.
190	00:12:09	00:12:12	Yeah.
191	00:12:12	00:12:15	Mom... Go. Go.
192	00:12:15	00:12:18	I'll be here when you get back.
193	00:12:35	00:12:37	Results from Alice Granger's jacket.
194	00:12:37	00:12:40	Found trace elements of iron, chromium, manganese and carbon.
195	00:12:40	00:12:41	Metals.
196	00:12:41	00:12:43	More specific, automotive sheet metal.
197	00:12:43	00:12:47	The metallic balls would've been released into the air during the welding process.
198	00:12:50	00:12:52	So you're saying our killer has metal balls?
199	00:12:52	00:12:55	Yes... maybe.
200	00:12:55	00:13:01	Turns out that the victim worked in a car dealership, so she could've gotten metal balls on the job.
201	00:13:01	00:13:07	And just in case you're wondering, working here, I'm developing them, too.
202	00:13:15	00:13:16	Yo.
203	00:13:16	00:13:18	Oh. What do you have for me?
204	00:13:18	00:13:22	Bullet is a .25 auto caliber Winchester full metal jacket.
205	00:13:22	00:13:25	You can't shoot .25s from a .22 caliber pistol.
206	00:13:25	00:13:26	I know.
207	00:13:26	00:13:30	Which means the semi-automatic you found in Alice Granger's car isn't the murder weapon.
208	00:13:30	00:13:31	I know.
209	00:13:31	00:13:35	Okay, well, did you know that the gun is registered to a Douglas Granger?
210	00:13:46	00:13:49	I don't understand why you're asking me this.
211	00:13:49	00:13:51	I'm her brother, not her husband.
212	00:13:51	00:13:53	You still own a lot of guns.
213	00:13:53	00:13:56	A .22 pistol, Colt .25, among others.
214	00:13:56	00:13:58	That's right.
215	00:13:58	00:14:00	We found the .22 in Alice's car.
216	00:14:02	00:14:06	If she carried it in her purse instead of leaving it in the car, she might still be alive.
217	00:14:08	00:14:09	I don't follow.
218	00:14:09	00:14:11	I gave her the gun last week.
219	00:14:11	00:14:12	Then what?
220	00:14:12	00:14:13	You shot her with your .25?
221	00:14:13	00:14:14	Are you insane?
222	00:14:14	00:14:18	It's no mystery who killed her.
223	00:14:18	00:14:21	Jeff Simon, her ex-boyfriend. Guy was stalking her.
224	00:14:21	00:14:26	She changed her phone number, changed jobs, moved a half dozen times.
225	00:14:26	00:14:28	No matter where she went, there he was.
226	00:14:28	00:14:30	Last week, I was over at her new apartment.
227	00:14:30	00:14:33	Jerk sitting in his car, in front of the building.
228	00:14:33	00:14:35	Is that when you gave her the gun?
229	00:14:36	00:14:38	Taught her how to shoot it.
230	00:14:38	00:14:40	Helped her get a restraining order.
231	00:14:40	00:14:42	Got zero help from you guys.
232	00:14:42	00:14:45	Catch him in the act. That's all we heard.
233	00:14:45	00:14:46	You know where we can find Jeff Simon?
234	00:14:46	00:14:49	Yeah.
235	00:14:49	00:14:50	We used to be friends.
236	00:15:11	00:15:13	Hey, I'm looking for Jeff Simon.
237	00:15:23	00:15:24	Jeff Simon?
238	00:15:25	00:15:26	Are you Jeff Simon?
239	00:15:26	00:15:27	Yeah.
240	00:15:30	00:15:32	When's the last time you saw Alice Granger?
241	00:15:32	00:15:33	Before the restraining order kicked in.
242	00:15:33	00:15:35	Come on.
243	00:15:35	00:15:37	This is just a big misunderstanding, Officer.
244	00:15:37	00:15:38	Well, I'm glad you feel that way.
245	00:15:38	00:15:40	You mind if we take a look in your truck?
246	00:15:40	00:15:42	What did Alice say I did now?
247	00:15:42	00:15:43	Where is it?
248	00:15:49	00:15:51	I don't get a break for another half hour.
249	00:15:51	00:15:53	Look, we can get a court order.
250	00:15:55	00:15:57	You can look anywhere you want.
251	00:15:57	00:16:00	Just give Alice a message for me.
252	00:16:00	00:16:02	I love her, and I want her back.
253	00:16:06	00:16:08	Look, buddy, she's dead.
254	00:16:23	00:16:27	What the...
255	00:16:27	00:16:30	I swear, I haven't been...
256	00:16:30	00:16:33	I haven't been anywhere near her since her brother broke us up.
257	00:16:35	00:16:37	I'm gonna check out his truck.
258	00:17:33	00:17:41	Gil, the suspect has a laptop in his vehicle that has a GPS unit that's honed in on the lab.
259	00:17:41	00:17:44	Well, you can't track a static location.
260	00:17:44	00:17:46	It has to be something mobile.
261	00:17:46	00:17:48	I know. That's why I'm calling.
262	00:18:35	00:18:36	Yeah.
263	00:18:36	00:18:37	You were right.
264	00:18:37	00:18:41	We found a GPS transmitter under the rear bumper of the girl's car.
265	00:18:41	00:18:43	Thanks.
266	00:18:46	00:18:48	He was tracking her car.
267	00:18:49	00:18:50	Let's bring him in.
268	00:18:52	00:18:53	Get up.
269	00:19:00	00:19:01	You are a real prize.
270	00:19:01	00:19:06	Jeff, your prints are all over that box, which means one count felony stalking.
271	00:19:06	00:19:08	That's seven to ten.
272	00:19:08	00:19:11	Murder two adds a quarter.
273	00:19:11	00:19:15	Now, you plead out now, you'll live to see parole.
274	00:19:15	00:19:16	I didn't kill Alice.
275	00:19:16	00:19:18	I loved her.
276	00:19:18	00:19:19	Is that your idea of love?
277	00:19:19	00:19:21	Stalking her with a GPS unit?
278	00:19:21	00:19:23	I wasn't stalking her.
279	00:19:23	00:19:24	I wo-worried about her.
280	00:19:24	00:19:27	So that restraining order she filed against you was because you're a nice guy.
281	00:19:27	00:19:30	Let me tell you about Alice.
282	00:19:30	00:19:32	She... liked to party...
283	00:19:35	00:19:43	...barely ate, hardly slept, didn't want to admit she had a drinking problem.
284	00:19:44	00:19:47	She needed me to look out for her.
285	00:19:47	00:19:50	Well, there's a problem with your story. She called a cab.
286	00:19:50	00:19:55	I'm telling you, Alice got into a Chrysler or... a Buick?
287	00:19:55	00:19:57	It was blue, maybe black.
288	00:19:57	00:20:02	And the guy she was with, maniac driver. Complete moron.
289	00:20:02	00:20:04	Wait, wait. You... you followed them?
290	00:20:06	00:20:08	I had to.
291	00:20:08	00:20:12	But I was pulled over by the cops.
292	00:20:12	00:20:16	They kept me on-on the side of the road for over an hour.
293	00:20:17	00:20:18	What time was this?
294	00:20:18	00:20:19	00.
295	00:20:19	00:20:20	It was a buck-fifty ticket.
296	00:20:20	00:20:21	I'm innocent.
297	00:20:22	00:20:23	Cut the crap.
298	00:20:23	00:20:26	We found trace amounts of automotive sheet metal on her clothing.
299	00:20:26	00:20:27	You work around cars.
300	00:20:27	00:20:30	If Alice picked it up from you, you were in violation of the T.R.O.
301	00:20:30	00:20:33	Lady, until we broke up, we spent every waking minute together.
302	00:20:33	00:20:36	She'd come over to my shop on her lunch break just to get some.
303	00:20:36	00:20:38	It was over, Jeff.
304	00:20:38	00:20:40	She didn't want you to be her lover, her protector.
305	00:20:40	00:20:43	She didn't want you within a hundred yards.
306	00:20:43	00:20:45	Whatever trace from you we found on her was fresh.
307	00:20:45	00:20:47	She worked around cars, too.
308	00:20:47	00:20:50	I'm telling you, I'm innocent!
309	00:20:50	00:20:53	You were living a fantasy, thinking you still had a chance.
310	00:20:53	00:20:55	When reality set in, you killed her.
311	00:20:55	00:20:58	I only did one thing wrong.
312	00:20:59	00:21:02	I didn't protect her from that guy.
313	00:21:02	00:21:04	What did this guy look like?
314	00:21:04	00:21:06	Sleazy bastard.
315	00:21:06	00:21:08	Slight build, dark hair.
316	00:21:08	00:21:11	I think he had a leather jacket.
317	00:21:30	00:21:31	Okay.
318	00:21:31	00:21:32	Do you have a minute?
319	00:21:32	00:21:34	I got a problem in DNA.
320	00:21:34	00:21:37	Okay, uh, it really is only gonna take a minute.
321	00:21:37	00:21:40	Um, I just need to have a conversation with you.
322	00:21:42	00:21:46	I processed the swabs from the wife who found her husband in the hooker case.
323	00:21:46	00:21:47	Right.
324	00:21:47	00:21:49	Two contributions.
325	00:21:49	00:21:50	Two?
326	00:21:50	00:21:52	One was a match to the wife's DNA.
327	00:21:52	00:21:54	The other was from an unknown male.
328	00:21:54	00:21:58	I found the same unknown male contribution on the swabs from the Alice Granger homicide.
329	00:21:58	00:22:00	Well, it's unlikely that they're connected. They're not.
330	00:22:00	00:22:04	I also matched that unknown male contribution to a rape kit from the day shift.
331	00:22:04	00:22:05	Cross contamination?
332	00:22:05	00:22:07	That's why I raised the alarm.
333	00:22:07	00:22:10	I was able to narrow the time frame to the last 48 hours.
334	00:22:10	00:22:14	Are you saying that all the DNA evidence from the last two days has to be resubmitted and retested?
335	00:22:14	00:22:15	We don't have any choice.
336	00:22:15	00:22:18	It's potentially all contaminated.
337	00:22:18	00:22:20	Document everything.
338	00:22:27	00:22:31	Hey. Your suspect, Jeff Simon, just got released from custody.
339	00:22:34	00:22:36	How the hell did that happen?
340	00:22:36	00:22:37	His alibi checked out.
341	00:22:37	00:22:43	I talked to the cop who pulled him over 15 a.m., right around T.O.D.
342	00:22:43	00:22:44	It's proof he lost track of her.
343	00:22:44	00:22:46	They jammed him for over an hour.
344	00:22:46	00:22:50	I mean, made him walk the line, gave him a breathalyzer, the whole nine. Guy confessed to stalking.
345	00:22:51	00:22:52	At least you got him on that.
346	00:22:52	00:22:56	Which they'll probably kick down to a misdemeanor because she's dead.
347	00:22:56	00:22:59	Hey. Phone number on the matchbook panned out.
348	00:22:59	00:23:00	Guy's on his way to P.D.
349	00:23:01	00:23:03	You got a name?
350	00:23:06	00:23:08	Was it necessary to show up at my office?
351	00:23:08	00:23:09	Try the phone.
352	00:23:10	00:23:11	I'm an officer of the court.
353	00:23:11	00:23:14	Mr. Novak...
354	00:23:14	00:23:16	do you recognize this telephone number?
355	00:23:16	00:23:18	That's my work number.
356	00:23:18	00:23:20	Did you write it on the matchbook?
357	00:23:20	00:23:22	I may have. What's this about?
358	00:23:22	00:23:23	A homicide.
359	00:23:23	00:23:26	That matchbook was found in a dead woman's pocket.
360	00:23:28	00:23:30	This the only evidence linking me to the victim?
361	00:23:30	00:23:33	This will go much easier if you just answer our questions.
362	00:23:33	00:23:35	Oh, yeah? Easier for whom?
363	00:23:35	00:23:36	Why didn't you write your name on it?
364	00:23:36	00:23:38	I'm a memorable guy.
365	00:23:38	00:23:40	Why not your home number?
366	00:23:40	00:23:41	This is getting tedious.
367	00:23:41	00:23:44	At bars, I give out my work number to weed out the crazies.
368	00:23:47	00:23:50	This is Alice Granger.
369	00:23:50	00:23:51	Do you know her?
370	00:23:54	00:23:57	I bought her a drink last night.
371	00:23:58	00:24:03	Okay, why don't you, uh, walk us through your evening?
372	00:24:03	00:24:05	Start with I left the office...
373	00:24:05	00:24:07	I was deposing a witness.
374	00:24:07	00:24:08	Left the office late.
375	00:24:08	00:24:11	Stopped at the Peppermill for a burger.
376	00:24:11	00:24:12	Medium rare.
377	00:24:12	00:24:13	No onions.
378	00:24:13	00:24:15	00.
379	00:24:17	00:24:18	Met this redhead.
380	00:24:18	00:24:20	Bought her a drink and...
381	00:24:25	00:24:27	Mr. Novak...
382	00:24:27	00:24:30	I'm Catherine Willows.
383	00:24:30	00:24:32	CSI.
384	00:24:35	00:24:38	You want to know what happened next?
385	00:24:38	00:24:40	Ask the redhead.
386	00:24:47	00:24:51	At a bar that time of night, we're all after the same thing, aren't we?
387	00:24:51	00:24:53	I came onto her.
388	00:24:53	00:24:55	She was into me.
389	00:24:55	00:25:00	I know when a woman is going to give way and believe me, she was there.
390	00:25:00	00:25:02	And then what?
391	00:25:03	00:25:05	I walked her out.
392	00:25:06	00:25:07	I put my arm around her waist.
393	00:25:07	00:25:10	She moved in.
394	00:25:10	00:25:12	One minute she's got her tongue down my throat.
395	00:25:12	00:25:15	The next, she puts on the brakes.
396	00:25:15	00:25:17	She's a bitch and a tease.
397	00:25:20	00:25:23	We should ask for his clothes.
398	00:25:23	00:25:27	Black leather jacket, black T-shirt, jeans.
399	00:25:28	00:25:32	What else should we ask him, Catherine?
400	00:25:32	00:25:34	This is what I was trying to tell you.
401	00:25:34	00:25:37	Yeah, but you didn't, so now I'm way behind.
402	00:25:38	00:25:40	Is he telling the truth?
403	00:25:43	00:25:46	He's not lying about anything that pertains to me.
404	00:25:49	00:25:50	He hit you.
405	00:25:50	00:25:53	No, it was an accident.
406	00:25:54	00:26:03	But... by the time it happened, he wasn't who I thought he was, and...
407	00:26:03	00:26:04	that scared me.
408	00:26:08	00:26:12	Eyewitness claimed that a man matching your description left the bar with the victim.
409	00:26:12	00:26:17	Drove off in a dark-colored, four-door sedan.
410	00:26:17	00:26:19	What do you drive, Mr. Novak?
411	00:26:19	00:26:25	Look, I'm innocent, but it's in my best interest to retain counsel.
412	00:26:25	00:26:27	We're done here.
413	00:26:34	00:26:39	You have to recuse yourself from processing evidence This guy's a lawyer.
414	00:26:39	00:26:40	He could claim prejudicial treatment.
415	00:26:40	00:26:43	Your whole life will become public record.
416	00:26:43	00:26:44	I have nothing to be ashamed of.
417	00:26:44	00:26:46	We all live in glass houses, Catherine.
418	00:26:46	00:26:48	You gotta be careful where you take your shower.
419	00:26:51	00:26:52	Catherine.
420	00:26:56	00:27:00	Just walk me through your interaction with the suspect.
421	00:27:00	00:27:04	I met Adam Novak in a bar called The Highball.
422	00:27:04	00:27:06	Were you drinking?
423	00:27:06	00:27:09	I had one cocktail, on his tab.
424	00:27:09	00:27:11	He walked me out to my car.
425	00:27:11	00:27:13	Things got physical.
426	00:27:13	00:27:15	Could you define physical?
427	00:27:15	00:27:19	I believe that I outlined the specifics in my memo.
428	00:27:19	00:27:22	Catherine, you know what I'm asking, and it's not in the memo.
429	00:27:23	00:27:26	I didn't have sex with him, though he clearly wanted it.
430	00:27:26	00:27:27	And you didn't?
431	00:27:29	00:27:31	I went out after shift to unwind.
432	00:27:31	00:27:34	I even invited Warrick and Nick to come along.
433	00:27:34	00:27:35	They had other plans.
434	00:27:35	00:27:42	All right. So... when you put on the brakes, Mr. Novak... got angry.
435	00:27:43	00:27:45	Yeah.
436	00:27:45	00:27:47	I got into my car.
437	00:27:47	00:27:48	He went back inside.
438	00:27:59	00:28:02	Hey, El, will you do me a favor and call me a cab?
439	00:28:02	00:28:03	Thanks.
440	00:28:06	00:28:09	This is just a theory, but...
441	00:28:09	00:28:14	she was drunk, probably more compliant than I was.
442	00:28:14	00:28:16	He walked her outside.
443	00:28:16	00:28:21	He waited with her for the taxi, offered her a ride.
444	00:28:21	00:28:22	I hate to break up the party.
445	00:28:22	00:28:25	Catherine, you got a 419 in Seven Hills.
446	00:28:25	00:28:27	I'll grab the kits and meet you outside.
447	00:28:30	00:28:31	We'll finish this later?
448	00:28:31	00:28:33	Guess we'll have to.
449	00:28:45	00:28:47	Look familiar?
450	00:28:47	00:28:49	Yeah.
451	00:28:49	00:28:50	Like the other night.
452	00:28:50	00:28:53	You got an I.D. on the vic?
453	00:28:53	00:28:55	Yeah. Holly Pearson, 31, single.
454	00:28:55	00:28:56	She lived across the street.
455	00:28:56	00:28:58	Car was locked.
456	00:28:59	00:29:00	Keys and purse were accounted for.
457	00:29:00	00:29:03	Found them in the mailbox along with her mail.
458	00:29:03	00:29:05	Any indication of sexual assault?
459	00:29:05	00:29:08	Well, her clothes and underwear are undisturbed.
460	00:29:08	00:29:09	Can you remove the jacket?
461	00:29:09	00:29:10	Sure.
462	00:29:19	00:29:22	Looks like a small-caliber gunshot wound...
463	00:29:22	00:29:23	like the first victim.
464	00:29:23	00:29:26	Location of the entry wound is different.
465	00:29:29	00:29:31	Slug's still inside her.
466	00:29:35	00:29:37	Grave is working a case with similarities.
467	00:29:37	00:29:44	That victim left a bar called The Highball shortly before she was killed.
468	00:29:44	00:29:47	I'm wondering if Holly went out last night.
469	00:29:47	00:29:48	I'm on it.
470	00:29:50	00:29:51	Thanks.
471	00:30:00	00:30:02	There's two sets of shoe prints...
472	00:30:04	00:30:06	With a bit of distance between the strides.
473	00:30:07	00:30:09	Which means they were both running.
474	00:30:14	00:30:16	Got some shell casings.
475	00:30:17	00:30:20	Well, there's only one shot fired in Grissom's case.
476	00:30:21	00:30:22	It was close contact.
477	00:30:22	00:30:23	He couldn't miss.
478	00:30:23	00:30:26	I'm thinking that she was attacked near her house...
479	00:30:27	00:30:29	and then made a run for it.
480	00:30:51	00:30:54	Got a courthouse keycard.
481	00:30:54	00:30:58	For the parking lot.
482	00:30:58	00:31:00	I wonder where Holly Pearson works.
483	00:31:00	00:31:02	Adam Novak's a public defender.
484	00:31:02	00:31:05	Let's run his prints against this.
485	00:31:05	00:31:09	Guys? I found a couple of the victim's coworkers.
486	00:31:09	00:31:10	They said she was at The Highball last night.
487	00:31:10	00:31:12	Got them coming into PD.
488	00:31:13	00:31:15	Holly was just promoted.
489	00:31:17	00:31:22	Youngest systems analyst at the bank and we were celebrating.
490	00:31:22	00:31:26	She wasn't exactly a party animal.
491	00:31:26	00:31:29	We practically forced her to go out.
492	00:31:29	00:31:32	Any guys come on strong?
493	00:31:32	00:31:35	Yeah. We collected numbers all night.
494	00:31:35	00:31:39	Anyone write their number on a matchbook?
495	00:31:39	00:31:43	I got, uh... business cards.
496	00:31:43	00:31:47	So... you're having a good time and...
497	00:31:47	00:31:49	Holly had had enough.
498	00:31:49	00:31:54	Yeah. We carpooled, so she took a cab home.
499	00:31:55	00:31:57	I'd like to show you some pictures.
500	00:31:57	00:32:01	See if you recognize anyone.
501	00:32:14	00:32:15	He bought us a round.
502	00:32:17	00:32:19	He tried to get friendly.
503	00:32:19	00:32:21	When Holly left, did you see that man again?
504	00:32:23	00:32:25	Actually, no.
505	00:32:31	00:32:33	Hell of a backlog, here, Doc.
506	00:32:33	00:32:36	Yeah. Traffic pile-up on I-15.
507	00:32:36	00:32:38	Holly Pearson?
508	00:32:38	00:32:39	Mm.
509	00:32:43	00:32:46	C.O.D.'s a one shot to the back of the head.
510	00:32:46	00:32:50	Absence of gun powder and stippling suggests a non-contact wound.
511	00:32:50	00:32:52	Dug this out.
512	00:32:56	00:32:57	.25 caliber.
513	00:32:57	00:32:59	It's the same as the first victim.
514	00:32:59	00:33:02	You know, I got something you might find interesting.
515	00:33:02	00:33:05	I emptied the stomach and she hadn't eaten for hours.
516	00:33:05	00:33:12	A small amount of white zinfandel-- Less than a glass, vintage undetermined, and a tiny scrap of meat.
517	00:33:12	00:33:13	Take a look.
518	00:33:17	00:33:20	Surface tissue of a human tongue.
519	00:33:20	00:33:21	Those are the taste buds.
520	00:33:21	00:33:23	She bit her attacker...
521	00:33:23	00:33:25	when he tried to kiss her.
522	00:33:26	00:33:29	This woman did not go gently into that good night.
523	00:33:43	00:33:45	Heard you may be looking at a second victim?
524	00:33:45	00:33:46	Yeah.
525	00:33:46	00:33:50	Bullets from both homicides are from the same gun.
526	00:33:50	00:33:52	I just got off the phone with Courthouse Security.
527	00:33:52	00:33:57	That keycard that you and Catherine found belongs a guy named Adam Novak.
528	00:33:57	00:33:59	Only prints I found on the card were his.
529	00:33:59	00:34:01	Well, let's call PD and bring him in.
530	00:34:36	00:34:38	Mom, Lindsey, go inside the house.
531	00:34:39	00:34:44	Believe it or not, Catherine does know how to say, Hello, how are you? Would you like a cup of coffee?
532	00:34:44	00:34:47	I was talking to your mother about the case we're working.
533	00:34:47	00:34:48	Mom, we're fine.
534	00:34:48	00:34:49	Take Lindsey inside.
535	00:34:53	00:34:55	Let's go.
536	00:34:55	00:34:57	I don't, I don't want to.
537	00:34:57	00:34:58	Lindsey.
538	00:34:58	00:35:00	Are you going to go out again?
539	00:35:00	00:35:01	No. I'm coming in.
540	00:35:01	00:35:02	I want to hear about your day.
541	00:35:04	00:35:06	It was a pleasure meeting you.
542	00:35:10	00:35:11	What the hell are you doing here?
543	00:35:11	00:35:15	I want to know why you're setting me up, manipulating evidence to make me look guilty.
544	00:35:15	00:35:16	All because I came on too strong?
545	00:35:16	00:35:17	I want you out of here.
546	00:35:17	00:35:18	I didn't get my signals crossed.
547	00:35:19	00:35:21	You changed the play, and you're screaming foul.
548	00:35:21	00:35:22	That's some power trip, babe.
549	00:35:22	00:35:24	Who's the guilty one here?
550	00:35:24	00:35:25	You want to talk to me, call your lawyer.
551	00:35:25	00:35:27	Set up an appointment down at PD.
552	00:35:27	00:35:28	You think I killed her?
553	00:35:28	00:35:29	Back off.
554	00:35:30	00:35:31	You going to shoot me?
555	00:35:31	00:35:32	If you take one more step.
556	00:35:35	00:35:36	You bitch.
557	00:35:37	00:35:39	You came to my house.
558	00:35:43	00:35:45	Mr. Novak, would you stick out your tongue, please?
559	00:35:45	00:35:46	What is this about?
560	00:35:47	00:35:49	Well, right now, it's about his tongue.
561	00:35:49	00:35:50	And two dead women.
562	00:35:50	00:35:54	We believe the second victim, Holly Pearson, bit her attacker's tongue.
563	00:35:54	00:35:56	Open up, please.
564	00:36:02	00:36:04	Uh-uh. Once more.
565	00:36:09	00:36:11	Thank you. That's all I need.
566	00:36:13	00:36:14	Have a seat.
567	00:36:22	00:36:24	You comfortable? We're going to be a while.
568	00:36:24	00:36:26	I know how this looks.
569	00:36:26	00:36:27	Adam, I...
570	00:36:27	00:36:30	I advise some of the stupidest guys that come through this room.
571	00:36:30	00:36:32	And it's my job is to keep their mouths shut.
572	00:36:32	00:36:36	And I know what you're thinking-- that I killed Alice Granger.
573	00:36:44	00:36:47	You're a mind reader.
574	00:36:47	00:36:49	I already admitted that I picked her up at a bar the other night.
575	00:36:49	00:36:54	What I didn't mention, and you didn't ask was that I gave her a ride home.
576	00:36:54	00:36:58	It got hot and heavy.
577	00:36:58	00:37:00	We both got what we needed.
578	00:37:00	00:37:04	Then she said good night and got out of the car.
579	00:37:04	00:37:05	I drove off.
580	00:37:05	00:37:10	Uh, Do you have any evidence at all that refutes my client's account, or suggests otherwise?
581	00:37:10	00:37:18	Our evidence pertains to the second victim, killed last night with the same gun, and we believe that a portion of your client's tongue was in her stomach.
582	00:37:18	00:37:19	I can explain that.
583	00:37:19	00:37:20	Oh? Really.
584	00:37:20	00:37:22	Her taxi never showed up.
585	00:37:22	00:37:26	I was drunk. Out of line.
586	00:37:27	00:37:29	Bad couple of days, thanks to you guys.
587	00:37:29	00:37:33	I was looking for a little release and I chose the wrong girl.
588	00:37:33	00:37:35	And what happened next?
589	00:37:35	00:37:36	Her taxi finally showed up.
590	00:37:36	00:37:42	I spoke to both the bartender at The Highball and the cab company, and a cab was ordered and drove the victim home.
591	00:37:42	00:37:48	Mr. Novak, have you ever been to Holly Pearson's house?
592	00:37:48	00:37:51	No. I have no idea where she lived.
593	00:37:51	00:37:54	Then how do you explain your courthouse keycard which we found near her body?
594	00:37:54	00:37:59	CSI matched the prints on the card. Only yours.
595	00:37:59	00:38:02	Every attorney in the Public Defenders Office is issued one card.
596	00:38:02	00:38:05	Mine has never left my car.
597	00:38:05	00:38:06	I keep it in the center console.
598	00:38:06	00:38:07	You don't need a warrant.
599	00:38:07	00:38:09	You have my permission to check.
600	00:38:09	00:38:10	It should be there.
601	00:38:10	00:38:13	Well, that won't be hard to verify, because your car's already at CSI.
602	00:38:19	00:38:20	Nick.
603	00:38:20	00:38:21	Hey.
604	00:38:21	00:38:23	The center console.
605	00:38:23	00:38:25	Was there a parking lot car key inside?
606	00:38:25	00:38:27	No. Two sticks of gum and a pack of condoms.
607	00:38:27	00:38:29	Why?
608	00:38:29	00:38:35	Suspect claims some incriminating evidence found at the second crime scene wasn't his.
609	00:38:35	00:38:37	It looks like he was lying.
610	00:38:37	00:38:38	We got him.
611	00:38:38	00:38:44	I don't know how you're going to take this, but I think this car was recently broken into.
612	00:38:44	00:38:46	These scratches...
613	00:38:46	00:38:47	they look fresh.
614	00:38:47	00:38:49	B&amp;E 101.
615	00:38:50	00:38:52	The Slim Jim.
616	00:38:59	00:39:02	Somebody could've swiped his keycard.
617	00:39:02	00:39:04	And then locked the car back up.
618	00:39:05	00:39:08	Novak wouldn't be the wiser until he drove into the courthouse again.
619	00:39:08	00:39:10	Did you find any prints?
620	00:39:10	00:39:13	Smudges and partials, inside and out.
621	00:39:14	00:39:16	Run 'em.
622	00:39:40	00:39:43	Let's run through the night Alice died again.
623	00:39:43	00:39:44	We've been through this.
624	00:39:44	00:39:45	I have an alibi.
625	00:39:45	00:39:47	Your alibi only proves you lost track of her.
626	00:39:47	00:39:49	You knew where Alice lived.
627	00:39:49	00:39:51	Have you been in Adam Novak's car recently?
628	00:39:51	00:39:55	No. I don't even know an Adam Novak.
629	00:39:55	00:39:58	But you identified his vehicle as the car that Alice left the bar in.
630	00:39:58	00:39:59	I didn't know whose car it was.
631	00:39:59	00:40:00	Then why did we find your prints in it?
632	00:40:03	00:40:06	Maybe somebody's trying to frame me.
633	00:40:06	00:40:08	No, but I think that you're familiar with the concept.
634	00:40:10	00:40:18	You were obsessed with Alice, and when you saw Adam having at her, you flipped out.
635	00:40:23	00:40:30	I mean, here's a woman that you can't get any traction with, yet she's willing to do a stranger she picked up in a bar.
636	00:40:53	00:40:58	I mean, lucky for you, The Highball was Adam's second home.
637	00:40:58	00:41:04	The next night, you came back and saw his car in the parking lot.
638	00:41:04	00:41:06	Creative justice. You could get them both.
639	00:41:06	00:41:13	It was just bad luck that Holly Pearson met Adam that night.
640	00:41:13	00:41:21	You had no reason to kill her, but you followed her home and worked up the nerve.
641	00:41:42	00:41:45	You made one mistake, though.
642	00:41:45	00:41:50	The evidence that you used to frame him brought us back to you.
643	00:41:58	00:42:00	You figured out the source of the contamination?
644	00:42:00	00:42:04	I got a positive result off my negative control.
645	00:42:04	00:42:05	Matched the contamination.
646	00:42:05	00:42:14	Turns out somebody at the manufacturer forgot to put on their mask and then sneezed or coughed on what was supposed to be a sterile product.
647	00:42:14	00:42:16	You have to collect everyone's swabs.
648	00:42:16	00:42:18	Kits. Trucks. Vests.
649	00:42:18	00:42:19	Work stations.
650	00:42:19	00:42:21	How long till the new shipment gets here?
651	00:42:21	00:42:24	It's on its way. Until then, do it old school.
652	00:42:28	00:42:30	Gil.
653	00:42:33	00:42:39	I'd ask you out for a drink, but under the circumstances, it's, uh...
654	00:42:41	00:42:43	Okay, how long is this going to go on?
655	00:42:43	00:42:46	I don't know, Catherine.
656	00:42:47	00:42:49	Gil, it was an act of omission.
657	00:42:49	00:42:53	How many times have we heard a public defender say that?
658	00:42:54	00:42:56	I went out after work.
659	00:42:56	00:42:59	Is it a crime to want a little human contact?
660	00:42:59	00:43:01	I guess that's why I don't go out.
