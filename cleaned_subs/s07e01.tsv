0	00:03:34	00:03:36	I always liked the circus.
1	00:03:36	00:03:39	Yeah, it's fun trying to figure out the magic tricks.
2	00:03:39	00:03:41	Well, that's taking the fun out of it.
3	00:03:41	00:03:44	Hey, the coroner's on his way.
4	00:03:44	00:03:47	Vic's a Jane Doe, no I.D.
5	00:03:52	00:03:54	Green powder on her dress.
6	00:03:54	00:03:56	Is she with the show?
7	00:03:56	00:03:59	According to statements, she wasn't a part of Cirque du Soleil.
8	00:03:59	00:04:02	Well, there's plenty of surveillance.
9	00:04:02	00:04:04	Yeah, but the body was discovered backstage.
10	00:04:04	00:04:06	What's it doing out here?
11	00:04:06	00:04:08	I think he wants to tell you.
12	00:04:08	00:04:11	Hi. Michel Souray, company manager of KA.
13	00:04:11	00:04:13	I'm sorry to meet you under these circumstances.
14	00:04:13	00:04:15	Why'd you move the body?
15	00:04:15	00:04:18	Backstage can be a dangerous place if you don't know your way around.
16	00:04:18	00:04:22	So the Cirque organization made a special agreement with Clark County.
17	00:04:22	00:04:27	Any accidents that occur inside our facility are under Cirque jurisdiction.
18	00:04:27	00:04:33	Our personnel immediately transported her outside and the paramedics arrived within minutes.
19	00:04:35	00:04:41	I have no idea who the poor girl is and I know every face on our staff.
20	00:04:41	00:04:43	Watch your step.
21	00:04:44	00:04:47	During the performance, the stages above you are always moving.
22	00:04:50	00:04:54	We found the body here in the crush zone.
23	00:04:56	00:04:58	Well, we know where she died.
24	00:05:00	00:05:01	Where'd she come from?
25	00:05:22	00:05:24	Where would you like to start?
26	00:06:06	00:06:08	Looks like he ate a .38 special.
27	00:06:09	00:06:10	The gun's still in his hand.
28	00:06:10	00:06:11	How many suicides have you seen like that?
29	00:06:12	00:06:13	Personally?
30	00:06:13	00:06:15	None. Me, either.
31	00:06:15	00:06:17	I haven't found a suicide note.
32	00:06:18	00:06:21	Maybe it was staged.
33	00:06:23	00:06:27	Sorry, got held up at the meet the future in-laws dinner.
34	00:06:27	00:06:30	Did they love you?
35	00:06:30	00:06:32	I got a little too excited talking about work.
36	00:06:32	00:06:33	They stopped eating.
37	00:06:33	00:06:35	Oh.
38	00:06:35	00:06:37	David, the gun is still in his hand; it's yours to clear.
39	00:06:37	00:06:40	Yes, sir.
40	00:06:40	00:06:42	Rigor's setting in fast.
41	00:06:42	00:06:44	It happens when it's hot like tonight.
42	00:06:45	00:06:46	Oh, are you all right?
43	00:06:46	00:06:48	You all right?
44	00:06:48	00:06:50	It's all right everyone, a misfire.
45	00:06:50	00:06:51	Hey.
46	00:06:51	00:06:53	At least we know one person who shot the dead guy.
47	00:07:03	00:07:05	Good to see you on your feet again, Jim.
48	00:07:05	00:07:07	You've never seen me off them, Sam.
49	00:07:07	00:07:09	You know, this is like old times.
50	00:07:09	00:07:10	You, me, a party.
51	00:07:10	00:07:12	A dead body.
52	00:07:12	00:07:15	This is supposed to be a celebration.
53	00:07:15	00:07:18	The Eclipse is going to be my legacy.
54	00:07:18	00:07:21	We break ground next year.
55	00:07:21	00:07:23	So I'm guessing you knew the victim-- Robert O'Brien?
56	00:07:23	00:07:25	He invested in The Eclipse.
57	00:07:25	00:07:27	Did you hear the shot?
58	00:07:27	00:07:31	No. Must've taken place during the implosion.
59	00:07:31	00:07:32	You think he shot himself?
60	00:07:32	00:07:34	You think he didn't?
61	00:07:34	00:07:36	Well, he was about to make a lot of money in your casino; why would he?
62	00:07:36	00:07:39	Look, I hardly knew the guy.
63	00:07:39	00:07:41	Or his partner, Joe Hirschoff.
64	00:07:41	00:07:43	They were marketing the project in L.A.
65	00:07:43	00:07:47	They had a little money, so I sold them a few shares.
66	00:07:47	00:07:48	How much is a share?
67	00:07:48	00:07:49	Two million.
68	00:07:49	00:07:51	You want it?
69	00:07:51	00:07:53	When was the last time you saw him?
70	00:07:53	00:07:57	Everyone was gathering on the other side of the roof.
71	00:07:57	00:07:59	I think he went off with his partner.
72	00:08:17	00:08:19	I got it.
73	00:08:20	00:08:22	Aircraft carrier.
74	00:08:22	00:08:24	That's what this place reminds me of.
75	00:08:24	00:08:34	Of course, an aircraft carrier was built for national security and this is a ton of hi-tech, twisted steel for the sake of entertainment.
76	00:08:34	00:08:36	It's not just entertainment, Nick.
77	00:08:36	00:08:41	The cirque's about the power of imagination-- it's how we were able to put a man on the moon.
78	00:08:50	00:08:52	I've got a monogram necklace.
79	00:08:52	00:08:54	A.F.D.
80	00:08:54	00:08:58	Well, it's not an I.D., but I'll settle for initials.
81	00:09:02	00:09:05	Did you and Mr. O'Brien arrive together?
82	00:09:05	00:09:07	Yeah, we're in a suite downstairs.
83	00:09:07	00:09:09	And you've been with him since?
84	00:09:09	00:09:11	Mostly.
85	00:09:11	00:09:15	A couple minutes before, um, the implosion, I went to get us margaritas.
86	00:09:15	00:09:16	When I came back, Robert was gone.
87	00:09:16	00:09:19	I knew he didn't want to miss it, so I went looking.
88	00:09:28	00:09:30	I was by the elevator.
89	00:09:30	00:09:33	I thought maybe Robert had gone back to the suite.
90	00:09:33	00:09:35	Then I heard that girl scream.
91	00:09:37	00:09:39	I just knew.
92	00:09:39	00:09:41	Are you taking any medication?
93	00:09:45	00:09:47	May I see that?
94	00:09:49	00:09:50	Alprazolam.
95	00:09:50	00:09:53	It's for stress. My job is very stressful.
96	00:09:53	00:09:54	Does Mr. O'Brien own a gun?
97	00:09:55	00:09:57	He hates guns, we both do.
98	00:09:57	00:09:59	Could you hold your hands out for me like this please?
99	00:09:59	00:10:01	Why?
100	00:10:01	00:10:03	Gunshot residue test.
101	00:10:03	00:10:04	Robert shot himself.
102	00:10:04	00:10:06	And this is how we prove it.
103	00:10:06	00:10:08	Right palm down.
104	00:10:14	00:10:16	Am I smelling alcohol on your hand?
105	00:10:16	00:10:19	Yeah.
106	00:10:19	00:10:21	When I saw Robert, I spilled the drinks.
107	00:10:26	00:10:29	Standard S.A.E. was collected.
108	00:10:29	00:10:32	No signs of sexual trauma indicated.
109	00:10:36	00:10:41	Several linear red-brown abrasions on the chest and back.
110	00:10:41	00:10:44	Marginal contusions.
111	00:10:47	00:10:52	Palpable underlying rib and sternal fractures.
112	00:10:54	00:10:56	Huh, Rice Krispies.
113	00:10:56	00:10:58	Subcutaneous emphysema.
114	00:10:58	00:11:07	Air in the tissue indicates victim was most likely subjected to significant crushing force across the torso.
115	00:11:13	00:11:16	You know, this crush zone is clearly marked.
116	00:11:16	00:11:21	Yeah, and anybody familiar with the stage would know to avoid that area.
117	00:11:23	00:11:25	Looks like blood on the edge of this lift.
118	00:11:27	00:11:30	It might have been unavoidable.
119	00:11:35	00:11:37	Her liver was lacerated.
120	00:11:37	00:11:45	If she'd been alive when the crushing occurred, these lacerations would of resulted in hemoperitoneum and, uh, bilateral hemothorax.
121	00:11:46	00:11:53	But there was no significant hemorrhage in the abdominal or thoracic cavities.
122	00:11:53	00:11:55	So she was dead before she was crushed.
123	00:11:55	00:12:01	Yeah, C.O.D. was temporal laceration of the brain due to skull fracture.
124	00:12:01	00:12:05	Initially, I assumed it was associated with a crushing trauma.
125	00:12:05	00:12:06	It wasn't.
126	00:12:06	00:12:08	So the fatal blow was a separate event.
127	00:12:08	00:12:09	Mm-hmm.
128	00:12:09	00:12:13	Well, the way things move around on that stage, it could have happened anywhere.
129	00:12:13	00:12:16	She looks like she's probably in her mid-20s.
130	00:12:16	00:12:17	She's in good shape.
131	00:12:17	00:12:18	Yeah.
132	00:12:20	00:12:22	Is well toned.
133	00:12:22	00:12:26	She got calluses on her hands and feet.
134	00:12:26	00:12:28	Could be a dancer or a gymnast.
135	00:12:28	00:12:32	But if she wasn't part of Cirque, what was she doing there?
136	00:12:34	00:12:35	Hey Sheriff, how's it going?
137	00:12:35	00:12:37	What can I do for you?
138	00:12:37	00:12:39	This is about what I can do for you.
139	00:12:39	00:12:41	Really? I've asked the Mayor to give you a commendation.
140	00:12:41	00:12:42	Medal of Valor.
141	00:12:42	00:12:43	Congratulations.
142	00:12:43	00:12:47	Well, that's-that's nice, uh, do I have to be there?
143	00:12:47	00:12:50	As a matter of protocol, I'd say you damn well better be, Captain.
144	00:12:50	00:12:58	Well, you know, Ben, if-- Look, I'm going to say a few nice things, hand you a plaque, we'll shake hands, a whole lot of reporters will be there to take pictures of the big event.
145	00:12:58	00:12:59	It'll be magic. Yeah.
146	00:12:59	00:13:01	My office will call you to set it up.
147	00:13:01	00:13:04	I was going to vote for you anyway.
148	00:13:04	00:13:10	The green powder on your vic's dress is open-celled phenolic foam.
149	00:13:10	00:13:12	Holds more than 40 times its weight in water.
150	00:13:12	00:13:16	Reminds me of this girl I knew in college-- I don't need to hear about that.
151	00:13:16	00:13:18	She was a florist.
152	00:13:18	00:13:22	The foam's used almost exclusively in floral arrangements.
153	00:13:24	00:13:25	Wait a minute.
154	00:13:28	00:13:34	The security guard at KAsaid that he let a young woman through the artists' entrance with a delivery of flowers.
155	00:13:34	00:13:37	He escorted her to the green room, but didn't remember seeing her leave.
156	00:13:37	00:13:39	Ah, the old flower delivery trick.
157	00:13:40	00:13:41	Works every time.
158	00:13:41	00:13:43	Huh.
159	00:13:45	00:13:49	Cirque du Soleil has cameras all over that theatre.
160	00:13:49	00:13:52	They use them for performance review.
161	00:13:52	00:13:59	I went through all the feeds the Cirque guys sent over, and I have to tell you, Siegfried &amp; Roy's disappearing elephant no longer impresses me.
162	00:14:00	00:14:01	I'll tell you how they did that later.
163	00:14:03	00:14:04	There's the vic, right?
164	00:14:04	00:14:05	Yup, 11-D.
165	00:14:06	00:14:07	Artist's entrance.
166	00:14:07	00:14:11	Girl has the same kind of dress and hair color as the vic.
167	00:14:11	00:14:15	As far as I can see, they managed to stay hidden backstage for most of the performance.
168	00:14:15	00:14:18	It's dark, they're wearing black...
169	00:14:18	00:14:20	crew's focused on their jobs...
170	00:14:20	00:14:22	it's possible nobody saw them.
171	00:14:22	00:14:27	The guy left alone, same way they came in, just before the show ended.
172	00:14:27	00:14:31	I tried to make out a face, but there's not much detail here.
173	00:14:31	00:14:32	However, look at this.
174	00:14:33	00:14:35	Check this out.
175	00:14:38	00:14:40	She dropped something.
176	00:14:40	00:14:42	I think it's a purse.
177	00:14:42	00:14:44	There was no purse near the body.
178	00:14:44	00:14:45	Or anywhere else backstage.
179	00:14:45	00:14:48	If we find it, it might get us an ID.
180	00:14:51	00:14:54	Give me the time code when she dropped the purse.
181	00:14:55	00:14:57	Okay, who's in the burrito?
182	00:14:57	00:14:59	It's apparent suicide, from Sam Braun's party.
183	00:14:59	00:15:01	Sara and Warrick's case.
184	00:15:01	00:15:02	Gunshot to the head.
185	00:15:16	00:15:18	What's this?
186	00:15:19	00:15:21	He bled out in the bag.
187	00:15:21	00:15:25	I guess I forgot to tape them shut.
188	00:15:28	00:15:31	This blood corrupts any GSR.
189	00:15:33	00:15:35	Clean it up.
190	00:17:06	00:17:07	Hey, Doc, you tell me.
191	00:17:07	00:17:10	Suicide or homicide?
192	00:17:10	00:17:12	Either side at this point.
193	00:17:12	00:17:14	According to Tox, B.A.C. was point-one-nine.
194	00:17:14	00:17:20	That's over twice the legal limit. My guess, based on the whiffing the stomach contents, tequila.
195	00:17:20	00:17:22	You're good, he was drinking margaritas.
196	00:17:22	00:17:25	Tox also found alprazolam in his bloodstream.
197	00:17:25	00:17:27	Yeah, his partner has a prescription for it.
198	00:17:27	00:17:30	He was also the one bringing him drinks. Hmm.
199	00:17:30	00:17:32	Hand me that trajectory rod. Sure.
200	00:17:32	00:17:33	Thank you.
201	00:17:41	00:17:42	Sara, hold this in would you? Sure.
202	00:17:42	00:17:43	Here we go.
203	00:17:44	00:17:49	However he got it, he probably would've been too stoned to stand.
204	00:17:49	00:17:54	It would of made it easier to stick a gun in his mouth at this angle.
205	00:18:00	00:18:02	Look in there.
206	00:18:05	00:18:06	Sesame seeds?
207	00:18:06	00:18:07	I think so.
208	00:18:07	00:18:10	I found them in the oral cavity, but not in the stomach contents.
209	00:18:10	00:18:14	It's hard to swallow when you have a gun in your mouth.
210	00:18:19	00:18:25	Okay, let me know when the Cliff Deck is where it was at that point in the show.
211	00:18:25	00:18:31	Um, I think it was just before the Wash Up to the Shore scene.
212	00:18:31	00:18:34	That was at, uh, 21 minutes, 37 seconds.
213	00:18:34	00:18:36	Copy that.
214	00:18:36	00:18:38	Yeah, that's great.
215	00:18:38	00:18:40	That's great right there, thanks.
216	00:18:43	00:18:45	Okay...
217	00:18:45	00:18:48	go find your friend.
218	00:18:52	00:18:56	Okay, move the Deck into its next position, please.
219	00:18:56	00:18:58	Copy that, foot deck is on the move.
220	00:19:15	00:19:18	Initiating dump sequence.
221	00:19:45	00:19:47	Amazing.
222	00:19:47	00:19:49	Ground cork.
223	00:19:49	00:19:50	From the audience, it looks like real sand.
224	00:19:50	00:19:55	You know, if you want to dive in here and give me a hand this might go a little faster.
225	00:19:57	00:19:59	Nice try.
226	00:20:02	00:20:04	Okay, hang on.
227	00:20:04	00:20:07	I think I found something.
228	00:20:07	00:20:09	This isn't the purse I dropped.
229	00:20:16	00:20:19	Celia Noel, Wisconsin.
230	00:20:19	00:20:24	Well, the initials on the necklace that Catherine found were A-F-D.
231	00:20:24	00:20:27	Well, clearly not her initials, but check this out.
232	00:20:29	00:20:32	It looks like she hit every Cirque show in town.
233	00:20:32	00:20:34	Apparently one a little bit harder than the others.
234	00:20:36	00:20:47	On May 11, 2006, with an innocent life hanging in the balance, Captain Brass went into that hotel room alone, face-to-face with a deranged killer.
235	00:20:47	00:20:49	Brass looks like he's about to puke.
236	00:20:49	00:20:51	Captain Brass was severely wounded, Or punch someone.
237	00:20:51	00:20:53	but the hostage's life was saved.
238	00:20:53	00:21:00	And for these actions which exemplify the dedication of the Las Vegas Police Department, the City thanks you.
239	00:21:04	00:21:07	This is Captain Brass' second commendation in the line of duty.
240	00:21:07	00:21:09	The first was in...
241	00:21:09	00:21:12	I got you a veggie burger.
242	00:21:12	00:21:13	Thanks.
243	00:21:13	00:21:15	What about me?
244	00:21:15	00:21:17	I didn't know you were here. Soy sorry.
245	00:21:18	00:21:20	Where's the love?
246	00:21:20	00:21:23	So we found some gunk in the revolver's forcing cone.
247	00:21:23	00:21:25	Hodges ID'd it as...
248	00:21:25	00:21:26	melted sesame seeds.
249	00:21:26	00:21:28	Doc Robbins found sesame seeds in the vic's mouth.
250	00:21:28	00:21:31	Any prints on the gun? No.
251	00:21:32	00:21:33	The grip was checked, we don't usually get prints off those.
252	00:21:34	00:21:35	Is it registered?
253	00:21:35	00:21:37	In California, to a Joe Hirschoff.
254	00:21:37	00:21:38	Really? Yeah.
255	00:21:38	00:21:40	He said he hated guns.
256	00:21:40	00:21:41	Check this out...
257	00:21:41	00:21:44	I researched ownership in The Eclipse project.
258	00:21:44	00:21:49	The vic and Joe Hirschoff held their share as joint tenants. Really?
259	00:21:49	00:21:51	Which means...
260	00:21:51	00:21:55	With Robert dead, Joe automatically and immediately owns all the shares.
261	00:21:55	00:21:58	Sounds like a great reason to kill.
262	00:21:58	00:21:59	Why did you lie?
263	00:21:59	00:22:01	I didn't lie.
264	00:22:01	00:22:04	I bought the gun when I moved to L.A.
265	00:22:05	00:22:08	White kid from a small town...
266	00:22:08	00:22:09	Put it in a closet.
267	00:22:09	00:22:10	Forgot it was there.
268	00:22:10	00:22:13	How did Robert get it? I don't...
269	00:22:13	00:22:15	Going through my stuff, I guess.
270	00:22:15	00:22:17	Did he take your pills?
271	00:22:17	00:22:19	'Cause we found them in his bloodstream.
272	00:22:20	00:22:21	I don't know.
273	00:22:21	00:22:24	You don't know? No, I don't know.
274	00:22:24	00:22:25	Robert was depressed. Maybe he did.
275	00:22:25	00:22:27	You know, we did a credit check on you, Joe.
276	00:22:27	00:22:29	You're in hock for over a million dollars.
277	00:22:29	00:22:31	It's personal debt-- that's heavy paper.
278	00:22:32	00:22:34	I'm leveraged.
279	00:22:34	00:22:35	(chuckles) Yeah, I'm leveraged.
280	00:22:35	00:22:37	So what?
281	00:22:38	00:22:39	I live well...
282	00:22:41	00:22:43	I live well by believing in myself.
283	00:22:43	00:22:47	No, you live well by playing the come line with borrowed money.
284	00:22:47	00:22:54	You know, Joe, you're the type of guy-- you see something you like, you got to have it, including your partner's share in The Eclipse.
285	00:22:54	00:23:01	So you put your pills in his drink, he nods off, you wrap his fingers around your gun, and then you get to live really well.
286	00:23:04	00:23:06	I want my lawyer.
287	00:23:07	00:23:09	Is this everything?
288	00:23:09	00:23:13	Everything from Hirschoff's and O'Brien's room that I could get under the warrant.
289	00:23:13	00:23:14	No suicide note?
290	00:23:15	00:23:18	Not even in the Holy Bible.
291	00:23:18	00:23:20	That is the first place I look, too.
292	00:23:26	00:23:28	Did the suite have a kitchen?
293	00:23:29	00:23:31	No.
294	00:23:31	00:23:33	Why pack an oven mitt?
295	00:23:41	00:23:43	Sesame seeds.
296	00:23:48	00:23:50	The blood on the necklace was the victim's.
297	00:23:50	00:23:51	A.F.D.
298	00:23:51	00:23:53	Arcadia Federation of Dance.
299	00:23:53	00:23:59	Celia Noel was a dancer, which would explain her fascination with Cirque.
300	00:23:59	00:24:00	You still like to dance?
301	00:24:02	00:24:05	I don't mean the way you used to, I...
302	00:24:05	00:24:08	I know what you mean, and yes, I do.
303	00:24:10	00:24:13	I think I have a line on the victim's date.
304	00:24:13	00:24:23	Now, four of the tickets that we pulled from her purse were charged to her credit card, but the Zumanity ticket was purchased with a different card, one belonging to a gentleman named Arnie...
305	00:24:23	00:24:25	Clifton.
306	00:24:26	00:24:27	He should have paid cash.
307	00:24:35	00:24:38	Yeah, Celia and I scoped out Zumanity.
308	00:24:38	00:24:39	Sexy stuff.
309	00:24:39	00:24:41	Right up your alley.
310	00:24:41	00:24:45	I've got all kinds of alleys, but, uh, yeah, I'd say that's one of them.
311	00:24:45	00:24:47	How'd you two meet?
312	00:24:47	00:24:49	I touched her feet for over an hour.
313	00:24:49	00:24:51	She tried on 20 pairs of shoes.
314	00:24:51	00:24:53	Did she invite you to the show?
315	00:24:53	00:24:55	Yeah.
316	00:24:55	00:24:56	Did you pay for it?
317	00:24:56	00:24:58	I'm a gentleman.
318	00:24:58	00:25:00	Best toe cleavage I ever saw.
319	00:25:00	00:25:03	What did you do after the show? Nothing.
320	00:25:03	00:25:05	We had a nice time; she split.
321	00:25:05	00:25:07	Haven't seen her since.
322	00:25:07	00:25:09	We have.
323	00:25:09	00:25:10	She's dead.
324	00:25:10	00:25:13	Backstage at KA.
325	00:25:13	00:25:16	You didn't join her for the double feature? (scoffs)
326	00:25:16	00:25:18	Nah, man, not me.
327	00:25:18	00:25:22	Look, uh, are we done, 'cause I got to get back to work.
328	00:25:22	00:25:24	No, we're not done here.
329	00:25:25	00:25:27	You got sand in your shoes.
330	00:25:30	00:25:34	Finely ground particles of Portuguese cork.
331	00:25:34	00:25:40	Same stuff they use backstage at KA, which places you at the crime scene.
332	00:25:42	00:25:44	Okay, so what if I was there?
333	00:25:44	00:25:49	You were there with a woman who wound up dead, which is why you're here.
334	00:25:50	00:25:52	Zumanity got me all worked up.
335	00:25:52	00:25:53	She was grabbing on me.
336	00:25:53	00:25:54	I-I was down to do whatever she wanted.
337	00:25:54	00:25:56	What did she want to do?
338	00:25:56	00:25:58	Go backstage at KA, see it up close and personal.
339	00:25:58	00:26:00	She was bananas about that show.
340	00:26:00	00:26:04	She said to meet her near the artists' entrance just after the show started.
341	00:26:04	00:26:06	I did. She let me in.
342	00:26:06	00:26:08	And you thought if you went with her, you'd get laid?
343	00:26:08	00:26:14	I figured maybe backstage at KA was her version of the mile high club.
344	00:26:14	00:26:17	Come on, come on.
345	00:26:17	00:26:19	Celia, just relax for a minute.
346	00:26:19	00:26:20	Come on.
347	00:26:26	00:26:30	Something clipped her in the side of the head.
348	00:26:30	00:26:33	She fell. She didn't even scream.
349	00:26:33	00:26:35	I was just so freaked out, I bailed, I'm telling you.
350	00:26:35	00:26:38	I tried to warn her, but she was just too fired up.
351	00:26:38	00:26:41	She kept trying to get closer and closer and closer.
352	00:26:41	00:26:43	Yeah, and you let her.
353	00:26:43	00:26:46	You need to write a statement.
354	00:26:46	00:26:51	I perfected my butterfly technique on chicken breasts.
355	00:26:51	00:26:58	I sauté them in a chardonnay reduction with herbes de Provence.
356	00:26:58	00:27:00	Drives women wild.
357	00:27:00	00:27:03	Well, Mom.
358	00:27:03	00:27:05	Now say the magic words.
359	00:27:05	00:27:08	Shut up, Hodges?
360	00:27:08	00:27:10	No. Open sesame.
361	00:27:31	00:27:34	Hand me that can of Ferro-Trace.
362	00:27:34	00:27:37	I live to serve.
363	00:27:46	00:27:50	The gun was transported to the hotel room in the oven mitt.
364	00:27:50	00:27:54	Only question is, who brought it to the party?
365	00:28:59	00:29:01	The trail of seeds proved it.
366	00:29:02	00:29:05	It was suicide, after all.
367	00:29:09	00:29:13	It's the first time I've ever seen a suicide where the gun stays in the vic's hand.
368	00:29:13	00:29:15	I have an explanation for that, too.
369	00:29:15	00:29:17	Dupuytren's contracture.
370	00:29:17	00:29:23	It's a rare condition, characterized by progressive fibrosis of the palmar fascia, The tissues thicken...
371	00:29:24	00:29:27	...contracting the fingers.
372	00:29:27	00:29:29	He couldn't let go of the gun.
373	00:29:30	00:29:35	The condition was still in its early stages, which is why it looked like rigor.
374	00:29:35	00:29:36	Do we have any idea why he killed himself?
375	00:29:37	00:29:38	Depression, maybe.
376	00:29:38	00:29:42	You know, according to my supervisor, we're not really in the business of why, but...
377	00:29:45	00:29:46	I got to go.
378	00:29:46	00:29:48	Bye.
379	00:29:50	00:29:52	These are Robert's personal effects.
380	00:30:13	00:30:15	I'm very sorry for your loss.
381	00:30:25	00:30:28	Okay. I'll do it.
382	00:30:28	00:30:29	Hey, Jim.
383	00:30:29	00:30:31	What's up?
384	00:30:33	00:30:35	Where's your hardware?
385	00:30:35	00:30:37	Oh, come on, come on.
386	00:30:37	00:30:39	Don't even try it; you were all over the news.
387	00:30:39	00:30:40	Let's see it. (groans)
388	00:30:43	00:30:45	Wow.
389	00:30:45	00:30:47	That's beautiful.
390	00:30:47	00:30:49	What's with all the modesty?
391	00:30:49	00:30:50	It should be up on your wall, man.
392	00:30:50	00:30:51	For what?
393	00:30:51	00:30:54	For taking a bullet or not dying?
394	00:30:54	00:30:56	For being brave.
395	00:30:56	00:30:57	You know, Warrick, I'll tell you something.
396	00:30:57	00:31:02	I walked into that hotel room, and 23 years of police work told me I knew what that guy was about.
397	00:31:02	00:31:04	And he played me like a damn rookie.
398	00:31:04	00:31:06	He beat me at my own game.
399	00:31:06	00:31:10	I mean, what's the dumbest thing you've ever done?
400	00:31:10	00:31:14	You want to make a poster of it, put it on your wall?
401	00:31:14	00:31:16	I don't think so.
402	00:31:20	00:31:22	But thanks for coming by.
403	00:31:23	00:31:24	All right.
404	00:31:31	00:31:33	So do you think Grissom will show?
405	00:31:33	00:31:35	Not if he thinks he has to dance. (chuckles)
406	00:31:35	00:31:41	Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow night, more than 18,000 people are going to come and see this guy at the Thomas and Mack Center.
407	00:31:41	00:31:44	But tonight, you guys are going to hear him first.
408	00:31:44	00:31:47	Everybody give it up for Mr. John Mayer!
409	00:31:48	00:31:50	Ooh. I like him.
410	00:31:50	00:31:52	I think you got to dance.
411	00:31:52	00:31:54	Come on, let's go. My God.
412	00:33:50	00:33:54	Oh...
413	00:33:54	00:33:56	Awesome.
414	00:33:59	00:34:01	I think I know her. I know that guy.
415	00:34:02	00:34:03	Yeah, I bet you do.
416	00:34:03	00:34:04	Ask her to dance.
417	00:34:04	00:34:06	Yeah? I'm going to get a drink.
418	00:34:06	00:34:07	You're sure? Go for it.
419	00:34:09	00:34:10	Hey, Nicky.
420	00:34:19	00:34:22	The guy down there wants to buy you your next drink.
421	00:34:26	00:34:27	No, thanks.
422	00:37:14	00:37:17	Have you ever seen anything like this?
423	00:37:19	00:37:21	No.
424	00:37:21	00:37:24	The detail is...
425	00:37:24	00:37:25	Terrifying.
426	00:37:25	00:37:27	Impressive.
427	00:37:27	00:37:29	And yes...
428	00:37:29	00:37:31	terrifying.
429	00:37:36	00:37:38	the chicken or the egg?
430	00:37:41	00:37:42	I've always been an egg man.
431	00:37:44	00:37:47	But this time, I don't know.
432	00:39:15	00:39:17	Las Vegas Crime Lab?
433	00:39:17	00:39:18	How can I help you?
