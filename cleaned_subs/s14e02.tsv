0	00:00:16	00:00:17	It's to you, Mr. Gentry.
1	00:00:17	00:00:20	$65,000 to call.
2	00:00:20	00:00:22	You've been playing me all night.
3	00:00:23	00:00:25	In fact, I think you're playing me right now.
4	00:00:27	00:00:29	What about you, Audrey?
5	00:00:29	00:00:32	You think this kid's trying to pull one over on me again?
6	00:00:32	00:00:34	I couldn't say.
7	00:00:34	00:00:35	Well, what the hell.
8	00:00:35	00:00:37	It's only money, right?
9	00:00:41	00:00:43	I'm all in.
10	00:00:48	00:00:50	I'll call.
11	00:00:50	00:00:51	Let's do it.
12	00:00:57	00:00:59	Mr. Gentry shows a straight.
13	00:01:03	00:01:06	Two pair. Aces and kings.
14	00:01:06	00:01:07	Oh, I knew it.
15	00:01:07	00:01:09	I got you.
16	00:01:09	00:01:11	Three-to-one odds in my favor.
17	00:01:11	00:01:12	This one's finally gonna be mine.
18	00:01:12	00:01:15	$490,000 in the pot.
19	00:01:27	00:01:29	Oh, no. No damn way.
20	00:01:29	00:01:31	The ace makes a full house.
21	00:01:31	00:01:33	Tough luck, man.
22	00:01:33	00:01:35	Maybe next time.
23	00:01:35	00:01:36	Cash me out?
24	00:01:39	00:01:40	Congrats.
25	00:01:40	00:01:43	What are we looking at, a little over $600,000?
26	00:01:47	00:01:48	Sorry, gentlemen.
27	00:01:48	00:01:50	Back-ups will kick in any second.
28	00:01:50	00:01:52	In the meantime, everybody keep your hands away from the table, please.
29	00:01:52	00:01:56	This is Brantson. We lost power in the Rialto Room.
30	00:01:56	00:01:58	That repair crew's on its way.
31	00:01:59	00:02:01	Hey, what's going on, man?
32	00:03:23	00:03:25	Everybody get back! Out of the way!
33	00:03:58	00:04:02	This maniac hit the Four Kings, made off with over a million bucks.
34	00:04:02	00:04:04	Well, I wouldn't exactly say he made off.
35	00:04:04	00:04:06	No, you're right.
36	00:04:06	00:04:10	Even if you leave with it, this town has a twisted way of getting it back from you, doesn't it?
37	00:04:10	00:04:11	Security guard's pretty shaken up.
38	00:04:11	00:04:13	He never shot anyone before.
39	00:04:13	00:04:15	Well, he still hasn't.
40	00:04:15	00:04:16	There's no wound, there's no blood.
41	00:04:16	00:04:18	Nothing.
42	00:04:18	00:04:20	Why'd he go down?
43	00:04:20	00:04:22	Ugh.
44	00:04:22	00:04:23	What the hell happened to him?
45	00:04:25	00:04:27	Whoa, he's swollen.
46	00:04:27	00:04:28	Here you go.
47	00:04:28	00:04:31	We were able to collect just about all the scattered cash.
48	00:04:31	00:04:36	Are you sure the upstanding citizens of Fremont didn't try to stuff their pockets?
49	00:04:36	00:04:38	(scoffs) With this? Why bother? It's counterfeit.
50	00:04:40	00:04:43	Yeah. Yeah, I'll say.
51	00:04:43	00:04:45	And bad counterfeit at that.
52	00:04:45	00:04:47	Chips are fake too. They're plastic.
53	00:04:47	00:04:51	So this guy leaves the casino with over a million dollars.
54	00:04:52	00:04:54	Where did it go?
55	00:04:54	00:04:57	I don't know. I'd ask him, but I don't think he's gonna be much help.
56	00:05:54	00:05:56	Oh, his name is Paul Brantson.
57	00:05:56	00:05:59	He was only 25 years old.
58	00:05:59	00:06:04	Married his high school sweetheart just six months ago.
59	00:06:10	00:06:12	This is your first one back.
60	00:06:14	00:06:15	You went through a lot.
61	00:06:17	00:06:19	I can handle this if you need me to.
62	00:06:19	00:06:21	No. I'm fine.
63	00:06:23	00:06:25	You know, I gotta do it. (laughs)
64	00:06:37	00:06:39	I'm Captain Jim Brass.
65	00:06:39	00:06:41	Tell me what you told the other police officers.
66	00:06:41	00:06:45	I... It all happened so fast, I, uh...
67	00:06:45	00:06:46	like it wasn't even real.
68	00:06:46	00:06:50	Like when you wake up, and you can't even remember what you just dreamed.
69	00:06:50	00:06:52	Okay, I want you to think real hard.
70	00:06:52	00:06:56	Before the lights went out, did anything happen that might have tipped you off that something was up?
71	00:06:56	00:06:58	Uh... I don't know.
72	00:06:58	00:07:00	I just...I can't remember!
73	00:07:00	00:07:03	Um...I had a glass or two of wine.
74	00:07:03	00:07:07	Just, I don't... just trying to calm my nerves. I...
75	00:07:07	00:07:08	Sorry.
76	00:07:08	00:07:10	Thank you. Excuse me.
77	00:07:13	00:07:15	I talked to about ten witnesses.
78	00:07:15	00:07:18	Not one of them can be sure of what they saw.
79	00:07:18	00:07:24	This whole thing looks like it was designed that way-- to confuse. (phone ringing)
80	00:07:24	00:07:26	Oh.
81	00:07:26	00:07:28	Says 201 area code. That's New Jersey.
82	00:07:28	00:07:31	You still settling Nancy's estate?
83	00:07:31	00:07:34	Mundane little things that are just never ending.
84	00:07:34	00:07:35	If you need to take that, go ahead.
85	00:07:35	00:07:37	We can handle things. Yeah, thanks.
86	00:07:38	00:07:41	Hey.
87	00:07:41	00:07:42	Everything okay?
88	00:07:42	00:07:44	(sighs) Help me focus.
89	00:07:44	00:07:45	What do we know?
90	00:07:45	00:07:48	Well, winner was cashing in on over 600 grand.
91	00:07:48	00:07:57	His chips on the table, cash to match, more stolen from the cart. Total take-- just over a million and a half.
92	00:07:57	00:07:59	A million and a half that's still missing.
93	00:07:59	00:08:02	Yeah, but the timing is what's bothering me.
94	00:08:02	00:08:07	The suspect knew exactly what time to hit--the pay-out.
95	00:08:07	00:08:10	So he had eyes in the room.
96	00:08:10	00:08:11	Anyone here stand out?
97	00:08:11	00:08:14	No, but there is a guy who's still missing.
98	00:08:14	00:08:16	Robert Gentry.
99	00:08:16	00:08:18	He was the last player out of the game.
100	00:08:18	00:08:20	Gone before the first cops arrived.
101	00:08:20	00:08:22	You think he's our guy in the room?
102	00:08:22	00:08:27	Couple witnesses said that Gentry and our suspect collided during the robbery.
103	00:08:27	00:08:32	What that an accident, or was it a hand-off?
104	00:08:32	00:08:35	It would explain where the money went.
105	00:08:35	00:08:37	Yeah.
106	00:08:37	00:08:39	Let's find Gentry.
107	00:08:49	00:08:50	You three want to be left alone?
108	00:08:50	00:08:52	Very funny, Finn.
109	00:08:52	00:08:56	I could use a hand getting these leathers off. Sure.
110	00:08:56	00:09:01	Ah, it's tight. Must have been a size or two smaller when he bought them.
111	00:09:04	00:09:05	Whoa.
112	00:09:05	00:09:09	I venture to say he was a size or two smaller when he put them on.
113	00:09:09	00:09:12	He didn't start the day like this.
114	00:09:12	00:09:14	Body's swollen; significant edema.
115	00:09:14	00:09:17	Some sort of allergic reaction, maybe.
116	00:09:17	00:09:20	Clint Tyree. He worked at the Four Kings.
117	00:09:20	00:09:23	Yeah, he rode a motorcycle in their stunt show.
118	00:09:23	00:09:25	Can't say I've ever seen it.
119	00:09:25	00:09:30	Judging by these X-rays, must be a hell of a show.
120	00:09:30	00:09:32	He's broken almost every bone in his body.
121	00:09:32	00:09:35	Hmm...
122	00:09:35	00:09:39	Huh. Guy could have used a new pair of boots.
123	00:09:39	00:09:41	So what do you think caused his allergic reaction?
124	00:09:41	00:09:44	Well, I saw a raised mark on his shoulder.
125	00:09:44	00:09:48	Could be as simple as a bee sting or spider bite.
126	00:09:48	00:09:54	A guy robs a casino, shoots a security guard, and rides off on a motorcycle, and gets killed by an insect?
127	00:09:54	00:09:56	I only said it could be.
128	00:09:59	00:10:02	It's the left shoulder, right?
129	00:10:02	00:10:04	Look at that.
130	00:10:04	00:10:06	An injection mark.
131	00:10:06	00:10:09	Somebody did this to him on purpose.
132	00:10:13	00:10:15	You need anything else before I zip him up?
133	00:10:15	00:10:17	No, no, go ahead.
134	00:10:17	00:10:18	You can take him. Oh.
135	00:10:22	00:10:25	Ma'am, please... Is that him? Is that Paul?
136	00:10:25	00:10:27	I'm so sorry, ma'am, but you can't be here.
137	00:10:27	00:10:28	That's my husband!
138	00:10:28	00:10:30	I have to see him!
139	00:10:30	00:10:32	Please?
140	00:10:32	00:10:35	Are you sure you want to do this?
141	00:10:35	00:10:36	Please?
142	00:10:41	00:10:42	Okay.
143	00:10:50	00:10:52	(whimpers) Ma'am.
144	00:10:55	00:11:03	All the while he was on active duty, four tours of Afghanistan, he wouldn't marry me.
145	00:11:03	00:11:05	You know why?
146	00:11:05	00:11:08	He was afraid of making me a widow.
147	00:11:08	00:11:12	He didn't want to put me through that if something happened to him over there.
148	00:11:19	00:11:20	I'm so sorry.
149	00:11:20	00:11:23	How does this happen?
150	00:11:23	00:11:31	How does he survive four years of hell over there, just to come back home and die where he's supposed to be safe?
151	00:11:32	00:11:34	Oh, God!
152	00:11:41	00:11:43	Talk to me, Hodges.
153	00:11:46	00:11:48	In English.
154	00:11:48	00:11:51	The writing on these newspaper bits is Chinese.
155	00:11:51	00:11:59	That, combined with traces of carbon, potassium nitrate, and sulfur, tells me the explosives used in the heist are essentially untraceable.
156	00:11:59	00:12:01	They're Chinese fireworks. M-80s, most likely.
157	00:12:01	00:12:05	Available at most any fireworks stand outside the city, if you flash a little cash.
158	00:12:05	00:12:10	Which brings us to our next potential dead end, the strobe ball.
159	00:12:10	00:12:15	It's a visual effects device used in the motorcycle stunt show of the Four Kings Casino.
160	00:12:15	00:12:18	The suspect could've stolen that from his job...
161	00:12:18	00:12:20	What about the casino's security video?
162	00:12:20	00:12:23	To complete the dead-end trifecta?
163	00:12:23	00:12:26	Apr√®s moi.
164	00:12:27	00:12:29	Okay, there he is.
165	00:12:29	00:12:30	That's him, right there.
166	00:12:30	00:12:32	That's the guy we're looking for.
167	00:12:35	00:12:36	What's going on?
168	00:12:36	00:12:38	It's the strobe.
169	00:12:38	00:12:40	The camera's aperture couldn't keep up with it.
170	00:12:40	00:12:42	It doesn't get any better.
171	00:12:42	00:12:43	So fix it.
172	00:12:43	00:12:45	What do you propose I do?
173	00:12:45	00:12:46	I don't know.
174	00:12:46	00:12:50	We got to find out if this guy Gentry was in on this heist.
175	00:12:50	00:12:51	You want me to do it?
176	00:12:51	00:12:53	No, no, n... I got it.
177	00:12:59	00:13:03	The lights in the Rialto Room work just the same as the lights in the rest of the casino.
178	00:13:03	00:13:05	They're all automated, controlled by a central system.
179	00:13:05	00:13:07	So how's the system controlled?
180	00:13:07	00:13:10	You have to be able to turn the lights on and off when you want to.
181	00:13:10	00:13:13	Well, it's... like everything else these days, it's, uh... (clears throat)
182	00:13:13	00:13:15	it's essentially...
183	00:13:15	00:13:16	an app.
184	00:13:16	00:13:18	You have to have an access code.
185	00:13:18	00:13:24	But once you're in, you can program whole floors, you can control individual fixtures, whatever you need.
186	00:13:28	00:13:32	So whoever killed the lights should be in the system.
187	00:13:32	00:13:34	Pretty much, he'd have to be.
188	00:13:34	00:13:36	(chuckles) That's a cute kid.
189	00:13:36	00:13:38	How old is he?
190	00:13:38	00:13:39	He's ten months old.
191	00:13:39	00:13:43	So the real question is, who has the app? Or the access codes?
192	00:13:43	00:13:47	Besides me? Uh... security department, hotel manager, executive manager, I mean, (phone ringing)
193	00:13:47	00:13:49	just a handful of people, probably.
194	00:13:49	00:13:51	Well, we're gonna need a list.
195	00:13:51	00:13:52	I don't have that list.
196	00:13:52	00:13:56	I mean, I set up the system, but the hotel manager controls the access.
197	00:13:56	00:13:58	Morgan...
198	00:13:58	00:14:00	Our missing poker player, Rob Gentry, just turned up.
199	00:14:00	00:14:04	He was at the Palermo Casino, playing with Four Kings chips.
200	00:14:04	00:14:06	Hm.
201	00:14:10	00:14:13	Whoo! (chuckles)
202	00:14:13	00:14:16	You had quite a night last night, didn't you, Mr. Gentry?
203	00:14:16	00:14:23	First you go all in at the Rialto Room, lose, then you wind up in this armed robbery.
204	00:14:23	00:14:26	Yeah, I tell you, whole thing was pretty crazy.
205	00:14:26	00:14:27	I feel lucky just to be alive.
206	00:14:27	00:14:29	Lucky? Oh, yeah.
207	00:14:29	00:14:31	But you're also a little stupid.
208	00:14:31	00:14:34	Come on, you didn't think we'd have every casino in town looking for these Four Kings chips?
209	00:14:34	00:14:39	And your dumb ass rolls into the Palermo today, buys in with 75 grand worth.
210	00:14:39	00:14:41	Where'd you get it?
211	00:14:41	00:14:44	Well, you know, I can't remember if I...
212	00:14:44	00:14:46	if I won 'em or bought 'em.
213	00:14:46	00:14:47	I've--I've had 'em for quite a while.
214	00:14:51	00:14:52	You see that?
215	00:14:52	00:14:54	It's an RFID chip.
216	00:14:54	00:14:59	Each one of these chips has its own digital identification number.
217	00:14:59	00:15:01	It helps the casino keep up with chip movement.
218	00:15:01	00:15:07	And these particular chips were scanned last night as they were being put on a cart for the Rialto Room.
219	00:15:07	00:15:12	So the only way that you could have them is if you stole them. Wait.
220	00:15:12	00:15:14	I had nothing to do with that robbery. Yes, you did, Robert.
221	00:15:14	00:15:21	You and your motorcycle buddy? We've got you on video texting him, giving him the signal to strike.
222	00:15:21	00:15:22	You're on the hook for murder, bud.
223	00:15:24	00:15:32	When that robbery went down, I--I ended up on the floor. Suddenly, I'm face-to-face with the chip cart. So you just helped yourself to a handful, is that it?
224	00:15:32	00:15:34	I lost big at the tables last night.
225	00:15:34	00:15:36	It was just a way to recoup a little.
226	00:15:36	00:15:38	But I didn't kill anybody.
227	00:15:38	00:15:42	Look, maybe I can help you.
228	00:15:42	00:15:44	Yeah? How's that? Well, as...
229	00:15:44	00:15:45	as I was slipping out of there, I...
230	00:15:45	00:15:47	I ducked into a service hallway off the main casino.
231	00:15:47	00:15:52	And I saw him, saw the guy in the motorcycle gear running away.
232	00:15:52	00:15:54	You know that's in the opposite direction.
233	00:15:54	00:15:56	Well, I--I'm just telling you what I saw.
234	00:15:59	00:16:01	Hey, we got to run this.
235	00:16:01	00:16:04	New security footage from the east side of the casino.
236	00:16:04	00:16:07	You don't know how happy that makes me. Of course...
237	00:16:07	00:16:08	sets the stage for greater disappointment.
238	00:16:08	00:16:10	Not batting a thousand today?
239	00:16:10	00:16:11	So far, no.
240	00:16:15	00:16:17	Swing and a miss.
241	00:16:17	00:16:19	Can I see that again? It's just him running away.
242	00:16:19	00:16:21	It doesn't help tie Gentry to the robbery.
243	00:16:21	00:16:23	Will you please replay it?
244	00:16:27	00:16:29	I was just in autopsy.
245	00:16:29	00:16:31	I saw Clint Tyree's X-rays.
246	00:16:31	00:16:34	He has multiple healed fractures and titanium posts.
247	00:16:34	00:16:37	There is no way that he could run like that.
248	00:16:39	00:16:44	This boot belongs to Clint Tyree, our stunt rider who died out on Fremont Street.
249	00:16:44	00:16:46	Check out the wear pattern.
250	00:16:49	00:16:52	Uneven on the outer heel, right?
251	00:16:52	00:16:54	Guy probably had a limp. Mm-hmm.
252	00:16:54	00:16:57	From a lifetime of motorcycle injuries.
253	00:16:57	00:16:59	Now, look at this.
254	00:16:59	00:17:00	Right after the robbery.
255	00:17:05	00:17:07	No limp.
256	00:17:07	00:17:09	Not even close. Mm-hmm.
257	00:17:09	00:17:10	Now, enlarge the boot.
258	00:17:13	00:17:14	No wear pattern.
259	00:17:14	00:17:16	It's a different boot.
260	00:17:16	00:17:19	Two suspects, identically dressed.
261	00:17:19	00:17:23	One of them pulls off the robbery, makes a run for it down the hall...
262	00:17:23	00:17:25	To where the other one must've been waiting.
263	00:17:25	00:17:29	Tyree knows he's playing the part of a decoy.
264	00:17:29	00:17:32	But he doesn't know he's also the patsy.
265	00:17:32	00:17:35	And right before he rides away, he gets an unexpected parting gift.
266	00:17:35	00:17:37	The deadly injection.
267	00:17:39	00:17:44	The guy who hit the Rialto Room is not the same guy who died out on the street.
268	00:17:51	00:17:53	Hey, Doc.
269	00:17:53	00:17:56	Hear you got a C.O.D. for me on our motorcycle rider here.
270	00:17:56	00:18:00	Well, the C.O.D. was easy-- the allergic reaction.
271	00:18:00	00:18:01	The interesting part is the cause.
272	00:18:01	00:18:06	I was able to identify the toxin that was injected into Mr. Tyree's shoulder.
273	00:18:06	00:18:09	An extremely aggressive coagulant.
274	00:18:09	00:18:12	This is an exemplar sample.
275	00:18:12	00:18:17	Watch what happens when I add a single drop into a beaker of blood.
276	00:18:22	00:18:24	Wow, look at that.
277	00:18:24	00:18:30	Massive clotting. In just minutes, all the blood's clotting ability is exhausted.
278	00:18:30	00:18:38	And as a result, massive internal bleeding occurs, in some cases leading to total exsanguination. But, now, we didn't see that with Mr. Tyree here.
279	00:18:38	00:18:41	No, because his allergy to the toxin killed him first.
280	00:18:41	00:18:45	Without the allergic reaction, he would've been in for a slow and very painful death.
281	00:18:45	00:18:46	What was the toxin?
282	00:18:46	00:18:48	Snake venom.
283	00:18:48	00:18:53	A species called Daboia russelii, commonly the Russell's viper.
284	00:18:53	00:18:56	No relation, I'm assuming? None that I'm aware of.
285	00:18:56	00:19:00	You said, without the allergy, it would've been a slow death.
286	00:19:00	00:19:03	But Mr. Tyree there was a professional stunt rider.
287	00:19:03	00:19:07	He could've led the cops on a wild chase for who knows how long.
288	00:19:07	00:19:10	But the allergy caused him to drop in the first few minutes.
289	00:19:10	00:19:12	Yeah, exactly.
290	00:19:12	00:19:15	So maybe our real robber had to change his plans.
291	00:19:15	00:19:17	Right? Maybe he had to do things a little faster.
292	00:19:19	00:19:20	Thank you. Thanks.
293	00:19:22	00:19:30	Well, you were right. Within an hour of that robbery, we had every casino in town looking for those chips, but we were too late-- he cashed 'em in immediately.
294	00:19:30	00:19:35	So by the time we sounded the alarm, chips were already in a casino vault.
295	00:19:35	00:19:39	Try six different casino vaults, all sister hotels to the Four Kings.
296	00:19:39	00:19:42	The Mediterranean got a shot of our guy.
297	00:19:42	00:19:44	There he is right there.
298	00:19:44	00:19:47	With that disguise, it could be anybody. Exactly.
299	00:19:47	00:19:50	Hey, so I've been doing some checking on the Russell's viper.
300	00:19:50	00:19:53	Turns out this thing is so dangerous it requires a permit for ownership.
301	00:19:53	00:19:55	Please tell me you found one.
302	00:19:55	00:19:56	Right here in Vegas.
303	00:19:56	00:19:58	Guy's name is Julian Reese.
304	00:19:58	00:20:03	He's a valet car parker for the Four Kings Casino.
305	00:20:03	00:20:05	Another employee.
306	00:20:05	00:20:07	Didn't show up to work today. Brass already put a BOLO out.
307	00:20:07	00:20:10	All right, I'll follow up. See you later. Okay.
308	00:20:10	00:20:11	Yeah, that works and I'll...
309	00:20:11	00:20:13	Akers. Hey, Stokes.
310	00:20:13	00:20:15	So parking enforcement spotted the car.
311	00:20:15	00:20:18	When the plates came back to Julian Reese, they called us.
312	00:20:18	00:20:21	When we found this, we called you.
313	00:20:24	00:20:26	Whew.
314	00:20:29	00:20:31	Yeah, that's our snake charmer, all right.
315	00:20:31	00:20:33	Looks like he got it right here.
316	00:20:33	00:20:35	Single shot to the head.
317	00:20:35	00:20:38	There's a small caliber casing on the ground.
318	00:20:38	00:20:39	There's also some bruising on his face.
319	00:20:39	00:20:42	Yeah, looks like somebody beat him up pretty good. And grabbed his shirt.
320	00:20:42	00:20:44	There's a tear in it.
321	00:20:44	00:20:45	Looks like there's some residue or trace.
322	00:20:45	00:20:47	We'll get it back to the lab.
323	00:20:47	00:20:52	So that makes two casino employees, the stunt rider and the valet parker, both involved in the robbery.
324	00:20:54	00:20:58	And both dead, which means there's at least one player left in the game.
325	00:20:58	00:21:01	Someone who I'm assuming didn't want to share the money.
326	00:21:01	00:21:03	So then what was this guy's part?
327	00:21:11	00:21:15	Oh, I'd say he played a starring role.
328	00:21:34	00:21:36	Oh, hey.
329	00:21:36	00:21:37	Uh, I'll start with the good news.
330	00:21:37	00:21:39	This...
331	00:21:39	00:21:40	is definitely your murder weapon.
332	00:21:40	00:21:43	Venom from the Daboia russelii viper.
333	00:21:43	00:21:47	And I found DNA consistent with Clint Tyree in the hypodermic tip.
334	00:21:47	00:21:51	However, I've been less successful getting DNA from the leathers.
335	00:21:51	00:21:56	There was quite a bit of perspiration inside, so I had high hopes initially, but no luck yet.
336	00:21:56	00:22:00	I'm taking another crack at it, but for now, I can't confirm that they were worn by Julian Reese.
337	00:22:00	00:22:02	What's with the orange color? Yeah, I'm not sure.
338	00:22:02	00:22:06	It might have something to do with the leather-tanning process.
339	00:22:06	00:22:12	Thought you might be interested to know that I have identified the trace left in the snake charmer's shirt lapels.
340	00:22:12	00:22:14	Your residue looks to be pumice.
341	00:22:14	00:22:15	Pumice?
342	00:22:15	00:22:16	Oh, uh, volcanic rock.
343	00:22:16	00:22:21	Created when super-heated, highly pressurized igneous rock is propelled from a volcano.
344	00:22:21	00:22:23	Is there any reason I couldn't have told her that?
345	00:22:23	00:22:25	Guys, I know where pumice comes from.
346	00:22:25	00:22:26	Why would it be on his shirt?
347	00:22:26	00:22:28	Well, it has many common uses.
348	00:22:28	00:22:34	Such as lightweight concrete, insulation, it's an additive in plaster and it's even found in toothpaste.
349	00:22:34	00:22:36	Hm. Is that it?
350	00:22:39	00:22:43	No? If the pH is alkali, that could indicate the presence of... Soap.
351	00:22:45	00:22:46	Mechanic's soap.
352	00:22:50	00:22:51	Look, I can't be here.
353	00:22:51	00:22:53	I just can't.
354	00:22:53	00:22:57	Do you hear me? I need you to sit in that chair now.
355	00:22:57	00:22:58	But you don't understand what you're doing.
356	00:22:58	00:23:04	Ryan, we found pumice from your hand cleaner on Julian Reese's shirt.
357	00:23:04	00:23:06	Do you want to tell us how that got there?
358	00:23:06	00:23:08	Look, I can explain everything.
359	00:23:08	00:23:10	Okay? Just not now.
360	00:23:10	00:23:13	I can't be here, all right? Please.
361	00:23:13	00:23:14	We got a warrant.
362	00:23:14	00:23:16	We checked your phone, okay?
363	00:23:16	00:23:19	It was your access code that shut down the lights in the Rialto Room for the robbery.
364	00:23:19	00:23:21	You were in on that heist.
365	00:23:21	00:23:22	And...
366	00:23:22	00:23:26	you shot Julian Reese so that you could have all the money to yourself.
367	00:23:29	00:23:31	Fine, okay, don't talk.
368	00:23:31	00:23:37	We're in your home right now, turning it upside down, and we're gonna find the proof that we need.
369	00:23:39	00:23:42	Well, no sign of the money.
370	00:23:42	00:23:45	And there's no evidence of a female living in the house, either.
371	00:23:45	00:23:47	I think he divorced the wife.
372	00:23:47	00:23:49	No divorce. She died.
373	00:23:49	00:23:51	From cancer.
374	00:23:51	00:23:55	These are all condolence cards.
375	00:23:55	00:23:58	These are all medical bills.
376	00:23:58	00:24:00	Poor kid just loses his mother.
377	00:24:00	00:24:03	Now he's gonna lose his father too.
378	00:24:03	00:24:04	Morgan...
379	00:24:04	00:24:06	you gotta check this out.
380	00:24:14	00:24:16	Sara...
381	00:24:16	00:24:18	this whole thing just went sideways.
382	00:24:25	00:24:26	We know what happened.
383	00:24:26	00:24:28	They kidnapped your son.
384	00:24:30	00:24:33	Yeah, now thanks to you, they're gonna kill him.
385	00:24:38	00:24:40	So what we're gonna do is just keep you in here.
386	00:24:40	00:24:44	We figure the best thing for you to do is stay inside, in case they try to contact you.
387	00:24:44	00:24:46	Now, all our boys are gonna be here.
388	00:24:46	00:24:48	We're gonna have taps on the phone...
389	00:24:48	00:24:50	No, no, no, no, no--this is exactly what I didn't want.
390	00:24:50	00:24:52	Hey! They said no police.
391	00:24:52	00:25:03	If whoever has Christopher is watching, who knows what they'll do to him! Hey, listen, man, there's a lot of people here working really hard to help you find your boy, and we're gonna do that, but we can't do it unless you cooperate.
392	00:25:03	00:25:06	Okay? Sit down, tell me how you got into all this mess.
393	00:25:06	00:25:08	Come on, let's sit down.
394	00:25:11	00:25:15	About, uh, two months ago, Julian approached me in the employee cafeteria.
395	00:25:15	00:25:21	Julian...Reese, the valet dude? He came to me and said that there was a couple other people who had come up with a plan, a way to get rich off the casino.
396	00:25:21	00:25:25	What other people? He didn't name names. And to be really honest, I didn't take him that seriously.
397	00:25:25	00:25:30	I mean, we see so much money that comes through here every day... I mean, and everybody's fantasizing about how they can get some of it.
398	00:25:30	00:25:35	Right. But I just told him no thanks, that I wasn't interested, not while I have Christopher to worry about.
399	00:25:37	00:25:39	What's with the alarm, man?
400	00:25:39	00:25:41	I--I...got to take a pill. Yeah? Let me see that.
401	00:25:44	00:25:47	Rifampin? What do you take these for?
402	00:25:47	00:25:51	Christopher's nanny, one of the kids got meningitis, so now we're all taking it as a precaution.
403	00:25:51	00:25:58	Yeah, okay. So what did Julian say when you told him you weren't interested in his plan?
404	00:25:58	00:26:02	He just said it was no big deal, that that was cool... and that was the end of it.
405	00:26:02	00:26:05	Until yesterday morning.
406	00:26:05	00:26:07	I went in...
407	00:26:07	00:26:09	to take a shower while Christopher was sleeping.
408	00:26:09	00:26:12	I mean, it couldn't have been more than two or three minutes at the most.
409	00:26:12	00:26:15	And when I came back out, he was gone.
410	00:26:15	00:26:21	And he wrote that note on my laptop. Keep quiet, do what we ask, and you'll get your kid back. And I went and I confronted him at work. Did you get physical with him?
411	00:26:21	00:26:23	Yeah, yeah, I admit it, I lost my temper.
412	00:26:23	00:26:25	I hit him, but I didn't kill him!
413	00:26:25	00:26:26	All right?
414	00:26:26	00:26:33	He said he didn't know where Christopher was, and that I should just go along, and that I should just shut off the lights in the Rialto Room.
415	00:26:36	00:26:39	But I did everything they asked.
416	00:26:39	00:26:42	Where is he?
417	00:26:42	00:26:44	Where's my son?
418	00:26:44	00:26:45	We're gonna get him back for you.
419	00:26:56	00:27:00	You know, when I was taken...
420	00:27:00	00:27:01	when I was being held...
421	00:27:04	00:27:07	...at least I knew you guys were looking for me.
422	00:27:11	00:27:13	This little baby...
423	00:27:13	00:27:15	what is he thinking?
424	00:27:15	00:27:18	He's in a weird place with...
425	00:27:18	00:27:20	without his father.
426	00:27:20	00:27:23	Yeah...kid cases are always tough.
427	00:27:27	00:27:28	Thing is...
428	00:27:28	00:27:30	whoever took him...
429	00:27:30	00:27:32	they already got what they wanted.
430	00:27:32	00:27:34	They have no use for him now.
431	00:27:34	00:27:36	Morgan, do you really want to go there? Why not?
432	00:27:36	00:27:39	They've already shown they have no trouble killing.
433	00:27:39	00:27:40	What's one more?
434	00:27:40	00:27:42	Yeah, but this is a baby.
435	00:27:42	00:27:47	And you just have to hope that it's...somehow different.
436	00:27:49	00:27:50	Yeah.
437	00:28:07	00:28:10	Sorry.
438	00:28:10	00:28:11	What's wrong with me?
439	00:28:11	00:28:13	Hey...
440	00:28:15	00:28:17	You're only human.
441	00:28:17	00:28:19	Thanks.
442	00:28:24	00:28:25	Let's check outside.
443	00:28:25	00:28:31	Father said he was only in the shower for a few minutes; maybe the kidnapper was waiting there, watching...
444	00:28:31	00:28:33	for the perfect time to strike.
445	00:28:33	00:28:35	We got to find this kid.
446	00:28:47	00:28:48	Oh, yeah.
447	00:28:48	00:28:51	Someone was definitely here, in this spot.
448	00:28:51	00:28:53	You can see his shoe impressions.
449	00:28:54	00:28:58	Perfect view of the hallway towards the bathroom door.
450	00:28:58	00:29:01	Kidnapper could have seen Ryan heading to the bathroom to take a shower.
451	00:29:04	00:29:06	What's this?
452	00:29:08	00:29:11	Hey, get a shot of that.
453	00:29:13	00:29:18	Some kind of coin. It could have fallen out of someone's pocket, if they were crouched down here.
454	00:29:18	00:29:20	Well, it's definitely not U.S. currency.
455	00:29:20	00:29:22	I don't know-- how's your Arabic?
456	00:29:22	00:29:25	My Arabic's crap.
457	00:29:25	00:29:27	But my Pashto's not bad.
458	00:29:27	00:29:29	Pashto?
459	00:29:29	00:29:30	Like Afghanistan?
460	00:29:30	00:29:32	Yeah.
461	00:29:32	00:29:37	Well, our first victim, the security guard, his wife said that he did four tours in Afghanistan.
462	00:29:37	00:29:42	You're thinking our innocent victim wasn't so innocent after all.
463	00:29:42	00:29:46	So Paul Brantson was far from an angel.
464	00:29:46	00:29:48	He left the military with a bad-conduct discharge.
465	00:29:48	00:29:52	Apparently, he was trying to smuggle more than a coin out of Afghanistan.
466	00:29:52	00:29:54	I checked the security schedule at the casino.
467	00:29:54	00:29:57	Mm-hmm. He wasn't even supposed to be working last night.
468	00:29:57	00:29:59	Really? He traded shifts to be in the room.
469	00:29:59	00:30:02	So it was no accident he was there.
470	00:30:02	00:30:04	I just processed the security guard's car.
471	00:30:04	00:30:08	Fibers found in the backseat are a match to the baby's crib.
472	00:30:08	00:30:10	There's also traces of zinc oxide.
473	00:30:10	00:30:12	Diaper paste.
474	00:30:21	00:30:23	Why won't anybody tell me what's going on?
475	00:30:23	00:30:31	My husband's dead, I'm trying to plan a funeral, and your people storm into my house and start tearing it apart without even an explanation! Ms. Brantson....
476	00:30:31	00:30:33	please...
477	00:30:33	00:30:34	take a seat.
478	00:30:44	00:30:46	Do you recognize this?
479	00:30:46	00:30:48	It's an Afghani coin.
480	00:30:48	00:30:50	Yeah. It's Paul's.
481	00:30:52	00:30:59	He always carried it with him to remind him of all the guys who weren't as lucky as he was, the guys who didn't make it back.
482	00:30:59	00:31:03	The problem is, we found it outside of the house where a young baby was kidnapped.
483	00:31:03	00:31:07	Well, then obviously it's not Paul's.
484	00:31:07	00:31:08	It just looks like the one he carried.
485	00:31:08	00:31:10	Except his fingerprint was on it.
486	00:31:10	00:31:16	And when we searched his car, we found evidence that a baby had recently been in the backseat.
487	00:31:16	00:31:19	No, no, this is insane.
488	00:31:19	00:31:21	There's no way Paul was part of a kidnapping.
489	00:31:21	00:31:26	30 yesterday morning?
490	00:31:26	00:31:27	You know what?
491	00:31:27	00:31:30	I'm not doing this with you.
492	00:31:30	00:31:33	I just lost my husband, and I haven't even been able to bury him yet.
493	00:31:33	00:31:37	I am very sorry for your loss, but right now, we are focused on finding that baby.
494	00:31:37	00:31:41	So if you know something, or if there's anything you want to tell us... No, no.
495	00:31:41	00:31:43	I'm not talking to you anymore.
496	00:31:43	00:31:47	I'm not speaking to anyone, except maybe a lawyer.
497	00:31:52	00:32:01	Okay, we've got at least four employees from the casino-- the stunt driver, valet parker, security guard...
498	00:32:01	00:32:03	and the maintenance worker.
499	00:32:03	00:32:11	These three all presumably part of the robbery crew, all killed during or after the heist.
500	00:32:11	00:32:13	Well, so much for honor among thieves.
501	00:32:13	00:32:15	Let me ask you something.
502	00:32:15	00:32:17	Why not kill the maintenance worker?
503	00:32:17	00:32:18	Why is Ryan still alive?
504	00:32:18	00:32:20	'Cause he doesn't pose a threat.
505	00:32:20	00:32:23	He didn't even know who the main players were, except for the valet guy.
506	00:32:23	00:32:25	And he wasn't in for a share of the spoils.
507	00:32:25	00:32:38	Well, we know we have at least one more player out there-- whoever shot Julian Reese and took the money. Good chance it's another Four Kings employee, but there are over 400 of them, so it's gonna take time to run them down.
508	00:32:38	00:32:42	Which we don't have-- that baby's been out there for more than 36 hours.
509	00:32:42	00:32:44	Hey, guys, just got a call from Akers.
510	00:32:44	00:32:45	Ryan Archer is gone.
511	00:32:48	00:32:50	Officer Akers!
512	00:32:50	00:32:52	What the hell happened here?
513	00:32:52	00:32:55	Captain, he was only out of my sight for a couple of min-- Why was he out of your sight at all?
514	00:32:55	00:32:56	H--he said he needed to use the bathroom.
515	00:32:56	00:32:58	I went to check on him...
516	00:32:58	00:33:00	Damn it, Akers, you had one job to do, just one job.
517	00:33:00	00:33:03	You were to sit on this guy, and keep an eye on him.
518	00:33:03	00:33:06	That's it, one job! Jim, come on, man, chill out.
519	00:33:06	00:33:08	Shut up, Stokes. Don't tell me what to do.
520	00:33:08	00:33:10	You, get out of here.
521	00:33:10	00:33:12	Captain... they contacted him.
522	00:33:12	00:33:14	We've been monitoring his phone.
523	00:33:14	00:33:15	This is an e-mail.
524	00:33:15	00:33:18	This is your last chance.
525	00:33:18	00:33:21	Meet at the employee parking lot, level four.
526	00:33:22	00:33:25	He's gonna get his kid.
527	00:33:25	00:33:28	No, he's gonna get himself killed.
528	00:33:37	00:33:38	I don't see him. I think we're too late.
529	00:33:38	00:33:40	I don't see him, either.
530	00:33:44	00:33:45	Nick!
531	00:33:45	00:33:47	Ryan?
532	00:33:47	00:33:49	What happened?
533	00:33:49	00:33:51	I've done it. I've lost him. I'll never see him now.
534	00:33:51	00:33:52	All right, calm down. Is this your blood?
535	00:33:52	00:33:54	Are you hurt? It's not my blood.
536	00:33:54	00:33:55	It just went off. I didn't mean to.
537	00:33:55	00:33:57	What went off? I was just sitting in the car, waiting.
538	00:33:57	00:33:59	Next thing you know, somebody comes up to my blind spot.
539	00:33:59	00:34:00	Suddenly, a gun was at my head.
540	00:34:00	00:34:03	And as I was trying to get out, I mean, I guess the gun went off.
541	00:34:03	00:34:05	Nick...I got a body.
542	00:34:06	00:34:08	It's the dealer from the card room.
543	00:34:08	00:34:09	No pulse.
544	00:34:09	00:34:11	She's dead. No, no. No.
545	00:34:11	00:34:13	She was the one person who knew where Christopher was.
546	00:34:13	00:34:15	Charlie-05, I got a 187.
547	00:34:15	00:34:16	Send backup, code three.
548	00:34:16	00:34:18	You better start talking to me, Ryan!
549	00:34:18	00:34:19	I got keys.
550	00:34:24	00:34:26	Over this way.
551	00:34:26	00:34:28	You stay with me! Stay with me!
552	00:34:35	00:34:36	I got the baby.
553	00:34:36	00:34:38	Christopher! Oh, my God. Oh, no, no, no.
554	00:34:38	00:34:43	Stay back, Ryan. There's no way I'm gonna let you touch him, and you're covered in blood. It's my son.
555	00:34:43	00:34:45	Look, the important thing is that he's okay, see?
556	00:34:45	00:34:47	He's okay. There's Daddy. Yeah, okay.
557	00:34:47	00:34:50	We'll get him to the hospital, we'll get you to the hospital, we'll get him checked out.
558	00:34:50	00:34:51	It's gonna be okay.
559	00:34:51	00:34:53	You're okay, buddy. Daddy's right here, okay?
560	00:34:53	00:34:55	Just get his Bun-Bun, all right? Okay.
561	00:34:55	00:34:58	It's gonna make him feel better. Yeah, we'll do that; we'll get his Bun-Bun.
562	00:34:58	00:35:01	Come on, let's go over here. Come on, now.
563	00:35:01	00:35:03	You're okay.
564	00:35:03	00:35:07	Our dead poker dealer, Audrey-- just came from her house.
565	00:35:07	00:35:08	She's got all kinds of kids stuff.
566	00:35:08	00:35:11	She's got toys, food, a makeshift crib.
567	00:35:11	00:35:14	Looks like she was gonna keep that kid for the long haul.
568	00:35:14	00:35:17	Also found this disposable phone.
569	00:35:17	00:35:20	In it was the text signaling Ryan to turn off the lights.
570	00:35:20	00:35:23	So she was the eyes in the poker room.
571	00:35:23	00:35:24	Okay...
572	00:35:24	00:35:28	the gun we recovered next to the dealer's dead body belonged to her.
573	00:35:28	00:35:30	Greg just ran ballistics.
574	00:35:30	00:35:32	It's the gun that killed Reese in his car.
575	00:35:32	00:35:39	So what are we thinking, that she's the mastermind, the femme fatale, the one who seduced the other three into executing her plan?
576	00:35:39	00:35:41	Oh, way she looked, it wouldn't have been that hard.
577	00:35:41	00:35:43	Is this it?
578	00:35:43	00:35:47	Is this really the whole team?
579	00:35:48	00:35:52	No...no, we can't.
580	00:35:52	00:35:54	Where's the money?
581	00:35:57	00:35:59	Hey.
582	00:35:59	00:36:01	Oh, that's not a late-night snack, I'm guessing.
583	00:36:01	00:36:03	No, I just came from the hospital.
584	00:36:03	00:36:06	They belong to the baby that was kidnapped and his father.
585	00:36:06	00:36:07	We looking for anything specific?
586	00:36:07	00:36:12	Well, let's start with where the baby was and who he might have had contact with.
587	00:36:18	00:36:20	Oh, try to preserve that the best you can.
588	00:36:20	00:36:22	It's special to the kid. Oh.
589	00:36:22	00:36:27	Yeah, it's funny how babies do that, fixate on one particular toy.
590	00:36:27	00:36:30	When I was a baby, mine was an elephant called Stinky.
591	00:36:30	00:36:32	Guess I carried him around in my mouth a lot.
592	00:36:32	00:36:35	He was always moist.
593	00:36:35	00:36:38	Moist means bacteria, which leads to stinky.
594	00:36:38	00:36:41	Henry, look at this.
595	00:36:41	00:36:44	It looks like sweat stains, the pattern, at least, but the color...
596	00:36:44	00:36:48	It's orange. Just like the tint that came off the motorcycle leathers.
597	00:36:48	00:36:49	It wasn't from the tanning process.
598	00:36:49	00:36:51	It's from the perspiration.
599	00:36:51	00:36:54	Chromhidrosis-- colored sweat.
600	00:36:54	00:36:56	It's a rare condition on its own.
601	00:36:56	00:36:58	More often, it's a side effect of something else.
602	00:36:58	00:37:01	Like copper miners can sweat blue from the minerals in the mine.
603	00:37:01	00:37:03	What about this? What about orange?
604	00:37:03	00:37:04	Could be a pharmaceutical side effect.
605	00:37:04	00:37:06	Is this baby taking any medication?
606	00:37:15	00:37:16	Oh, finally.
607	00:37:16	00:37:19	(laughs) Doctor said everything looks good.
608	00:37:19	00:37:21	There's nothing to worry about.
609	00:37:21	00:37:23	Thought I might never get to hold him again.
610	00:37:23	00:37:26	No one's happier than me to see this reunion.
611	00:37:28	00:37:32	I've been so obsessed with the loss of my wife, I haven't focused enough on him.
612	00:37:34	00:37:36	You did the best you could.
613	00:37:38	00:37:40	How's your son, Mr. Archer?
614	00:37:40	00:37:41	Seems to be doing fine.
615	00:37:41	00:37:43	Doctors said he checked out okay.
616	00:37:43	00:37:46	I guess the kidnappers took pretty good care of him then.
617	00:37:46	00:37:50	Fed him, changed his diaper, gave him his medication.
618	00:37:50	00:37:52	Your son is on rifampin, right?
619	00:37:52	00:37:53	You both are?
620	00:37:53	00:37:55	What's going on, Sara?
621	00:37:55	00:38:01	Well, the hospital ran blood tests on Christopher tonight, and his rifampin level suggested he had a dose about ten hours ago.
622	00:38:01	00:38:06	Would you like to explain to me how the kidnappers knew to give him his medication?
623	00:38:13	00:38:14	Well done, Mr. Archer.
624	00:38:14	00:38:18	You played us, you played the sympathy card with your son.
625	00:38:18	00:38:20	You had us all believing that you were one of the victims.
626	00:38:20	00:38:23	Not bad. Look, I don't care what you say.
627	00:38:23	00:38:25	I didn't kidnap my own son.
628	00:38:25	00:38:28	It was that security guard, just like you said.
629	00:38:28	00:38:30	They took Christopher to force me to be part of their plan.
630	00:38:30	00:38:32	That's what you wanted us to think.
631	00:38:32	00:38:39	But it was you who planted the Afghani coin in your garden, and it was you who put the diaper paste in his backseat.
632	00:38:39	00:38:44	My God, you make me out to be like I'm this criminal mastermind with this crazy plan.
633	00:38:44	00:38:45	I just did what I had to do!
634	00:38:45	00:38:47	I turned off the lights. That's all.
635	00:38:47	00:38:49	That is not all.
636	00:38:49	00:38:50	Not even close.
637	00:38:50	00:38:54	This, uh, medication you're on, rifampin, has an interesting side effect.
638	00:38:54	00:38:56	It's called chromhidrosis.
639	00:38:56	00:38:58	Causes colored sweat.
640	00:38:58	00:39:00	Your baby's sweat is orange, your sweat is orange.
641	00:39:00	00:39:02	Haven't you noticed?
642	00:39:02	00:39:04	We've only been taking it a couple days.
643	00:39:04	00:39:05	Does it really matter? Yeah.
644	00:39:05	00:39:07	Yeah, it matters.
645	00:39:07	00:39:09	That's you.
646	00:39:09	00:39:11	You were sweating when you robbed the card room.
647	00:39:11	00:39:15	You were sweating when you shot Paul Brantson.
648	00:39:15	00:39:19	Injecting Clint Tyree with snake venom-- that made you sweat too, right?
649	00:39:19	00:39:30	And then, after the robbery, you went and you killed Julian Reese, and then you stashed the motorcycle leathers and the syringe in his car, hoping that we'd think that Reese was the gunman.
650	00:39:30	00:39:32	There was only one problem.
651	00:39:32	00:39:39	Those motorcycle leathers absorbed a lot of sweat-- orange sweat-- when I compared them to the shirt that I took from you tonight, guess what?
652	00:39:39	00:39:43	They were a perfect match, right down to identical traces of rifampin.
653	00:39:43	00:39:46	So that puts you in the leathers, Ryan.
654	00:39:46	00:39:48	You're our guy.
655	00:39:48	00:39:51	You robbed the Rialto Room, and you killed four people.
656	00:39:58	00:39:59	I didn't do it for me.
657	00:39:59	00:40:01	Oh, let me guess.
658	00:40:01	00:40:03	This is the part where you argue for father of the year.
659	00:40:03	00:40:06	Chris was five months old when my wife died.
660	00:40:06	00:40:09	Do you have any idea the amount of medical bills she left behind?
661	00:40:09	00:40:11	So you killed four people to pay them?
662	00:40:11	00:40:13	So much money goes through that place.
663	00:40:13	00:40:17	I mean, just a handful of chips would have changed everything for me and Chris.
664	00:40:20	00:40:23	I mean, just think how I could have raised him.
665	00:40:23	00:40:25	Yeah, how are you going to raise him now?
666	00:40:35	00:40:37	Hey, man. Hey, you got a second?
667	00:40:37	00:40:39	Yeah, sure. What's up?
668	00:40:41	00:40:43	I owe you an apology.
669	00:40:43	00:40:45	(chuckles) For what?
670	00:40:45	00:40:47	For jumping on you and jumping on Akers.
671	00:40:47	00:40:49	I talked to Akers, and now I'm talking to you--I'm sorry.
672	00:40:49	00:40:52	Jim, I get it.
673	00:40:52	00:40:54	You got a lot going on right now, okay?
674	00:40:54	00:40:56	Yeah, I got a lot going on, yeah.
675	00:40:56	00:40:58	The D.A.'s calling me.
676	00:40:58	00:41:03	The prosecutor wants to talk to me about testifying against my daughter.
677	00:41:03	00:41:08	Yeah, I mean, I'm on the phone six or seven times a day to New Jersey, handling my ex-wife's affairs.
678	00:41:08	00:41:13	Come on, everything will be back to normal eventually.
679	00:41:13	00:41:14	You know that.
680	00:41:14	00:41:16	Back to normal-- I'd like that.
681	00:41:18	00:41:23	But I'll tell you, Nick, the way my life's going right now, I don't know what normal is.
682	00:41:30	00:41:31	Hey.
683	00:41:31	00:41:33	Hey.
684	00:41:33	00:41:34	Just got off the phone with Greg.
685	00:41:34	00:41:38	They found the money in a maintenance locker at the casino.
686	00:41:41	00:41:42	Good.
687	00:41:42	00:41:43	Sit down.
688	00:41:51	00:41:55	I just wish we could take the money, you know, put it in a trust for that poor kid.
689	00:41:57	00:41:58	That'd be nice.
690	00:42:02	00:42:05	Well, kids are resilient.
691	00:42:05	00:42:08	Maybe he'll be all right.
692	00:42:08	00:42:10	What about you?
693	00:42:10	00:42:12	You gonna be all right?
694	00:42:16	00:42:18	Time heals all, right?
695	00:42:22	00:42:24	I guess we'll find out if that's true.
696	00:42:29	00:42:30	Have a good night.
697	00:42:30	00:42:32	You too.
