0	00:00:08	00:00:11	So, uh... you are dating that nurse.
1	00:00:11	00:00:13	I have to work with you?!
2	00:00:13	00:00:15	Uh-huh. And what happened to Doc Robbins' niece?
3	00:00:15	00:00:17	Oh, nothing. I'm just keeping my options open.
4	00:00:17	00:00:18	I called her, genius.
5	00:00:18	00:00:20	She's not answering her cell phone.
6	00:00:20	00:00:23	Why do you think I called you people? You know what?
7	00:00:23	00:00:25	I want to talk to your boss. I want to talk to him now.
8	00:00:25	00:00:27	She's busy. She.
9	00:00:27	00:00:29	All right, what's going on, Mitch?
10	00:00:29	00:00:30	Meet Dwayne Hicks.
11	00:00:30	00:00:32	He reported his wife missing.
12	00:00:32	00:00:33	He's all yours.
13	00:00:35	00:00:37	Mr. Hicks, I'm Nick Stokes. This is Sara Sidle.
14	00:00:37	00:00:38	We're with the crime scene unit.
15	00:00:38	00:00:40	When's the last time you saw your wife?
16	00:00:40	00:00:41	Last night.
17	00:00:41	00:00:45	Debbie and I had an early dinner and then I went to work. And where do you work?
18	00:00:45	00:00:48	What the hell does that have to do with you finding my wife?
19	00:00:48	00:00:50	Are you refusing to answer the question? Okay, look...
20	00:00:50	00:00:51	Mr. Hicks...
21	00:00:51	00:00:53	we're just trying to help you out, man.
22	00:00:53	00:00:58	All right. I work as a night manager at the Swift Deal, okay?
23	00:00:58	00:00:59	All right. And, uh...
24	00:00:59	00:01:01	where was the last place that you saw Debbie?
25	00:01:01	00:01:02	Deb... yeah, Debbie.
26	00:01:02	00:01:04	At home.
27	00:01:04	00:01:07	You want to know what we ate, too?
28	00:01:07	00:01:09	Um...
29	00:01:09	00:01:10	which house is yours?
30	00:01:10	00:01:11	Five twenty-eight.
31	00:01:18	00:01:20	The vacant lot.
32	00:01:20	00:01:22	Yeah, it's a vacant lot because someone stole my house.
33	00:01:22	00:01:28	So you're saying when you went to work last night, the house was there, and your wife was inside?
34	00:01:28	00:01:30	Yes. And now they're both missing.
35	00:01:30	00:01:33	Ye... that is what I'm trying to tell you people!
36	00:01:33	00:01:34	Come on!
37	00:01:36	00:01:39	So you think somebody was after the house, or the wife?
38	00:01:45	00:01:47	Oh, that's great!
39	00:01:47	00:01:48	Yeah!
40	00:02:34	00:02:37	Okay. Is your name Julie Finlay?
41	00:02:37	00:02:38	Yes.
42	00:02:38	00:02:40	And were you born in Philadelphia?
43	00:02:40	00:02:41	Yes.
44	00:02:41	00:02:46	Have you used any illegal drugs, including marijuana, in the last ten years?
45	00:02:46	00:02:48	No.
46	00:02:50	00:02:53	Hm.
47	00:02:53	00:02:54	Do you...
48	00:02:54	00:02:58	...resent having my honesty gauged by debunked pseudo-technology?
49	00:02:58	00:03:01	Don't do that... Yeah. A little bit.
50	00:03:01	00:03:03	Please keep your answers to a yes or no.
51	00:03:03	00:03:05	Yes.
52	00:03:05	00:03:07	Do you have any criminal history?
53	00:03:07	00:03:10	I was married twice.
54	00:03:10	00:03:11	Did my time.
55	00:03:11	00:03:14	Have you ever had sex with an animal?
56	00:03:14	00:03:16	Oh, my... really?
57	00:03:16	00:03:18	Oh, God.
58	00:03:18	00:03:19	Yes, or no?
59	00:03:19	00:03:21	Well, my first ex-husband was a bit of a dog.
60	00:03:22	00:03:26	And my second, a pig.
61	00:03:26	00:03:28	Does that count?
62	00:03:28	00:03:30	I don't know why you bother.
63	00:03:30	00:03:32	Those people never have a sense of humor, you know that.
64	00:03:32	00:03:33	I know. I couldn't help myself.
65	00:03:33	00:03:35	Well, I did pass, didn't I?
66	00:03:35	00:03:37	Welcome to Las Vegas.
67	00:03:39	00:03:41	Ugh.
68	00:03:41	00:03:43	Well, at least it's a better picture than I took in Seattle.
69	00:03:43	00:03:45	Things are looking up.
70	00:03:45	00:03:47	Yeah. Um, hey, guys?
71	00:03:47	00:03:50	Do me a favor, come in here for a second?
72	00:03:50	00:03:52	I want you to meet someone.
73	00:03:52	00:03:56	Sara Sidle, Morgan Brody, this is Julie Finlay.
74	00:03:56	00:03:58	Uh... Finn, with two N's.
75	00:03:58	00:04:00	So nice to meet you. Finn's coming on board.
76	00:04:00	00:04:05	Oh. I heard about your, uh, amazing blood reconstruction from Greg. Oh...
77	00:04:05	00:04:07	Why don't you guys give her the official tour?
78	00:04:07	00:04:10	I'd love to, but I'm due back at my crime scene.
79	00:04:10	00:04:12	We have a house to find.
80	00:04:12	00:04:13	But, uh, it's nice to meet you, Finn.
81	00:04:13	00:04:15	Nice to meet you. I'll do it.
82	00:04:15	00:04:18	I'll even give you the unofficial tour.
83	00:04:18	00:04:20	Nice.
84	00:04:20	00:04:22	I like her already.
85	00:04:25	00:04:27	This damage is recent.
86	00:04:27	00:04:29	Yeah. Ran the plates.
87	00:04:29	00:04:32	Car belongs to the missing wife, Debbie Hicks.
88	00:04:32	00:04:36	Supports the husband's story that the wife was inside the house when the house was stolen.
89	00:04:36	00:04:39	I mean, if you want to kidnap someone, why take the whole house?
90	00:04:39	00:04:41	Captain, I talked to the neighbors.
91	00:04:41	00:04:44	A couple of them saw the house driving off last night.
92	00:04:44	00:04:46	Thought the family was moving to another neighborhood.
93	00:04:53	00:04:55	What the hell?
94	00:04:55	00:04:56	What'd you do with the house?
95	00:04:56	00:04:58	What do you mean, me? You stole the house!
96	00:04:58	00:05:00	I didn't do nothing, okay? You stashed it away somewhere!
97	00:05:00	00:05:02	Really? Why would I steal my own house?
98	00:05:02	00:05:04	Because it's not your house, Dwayne.
99	00:05:04	00:05:05	Hey, calm down, now. Oh, my God!
100	00:05:05	00:05:07	Just 'cause you live in the house doesn't make it yours.
101	00:05:07	00:05:09	Possession is 9/10 of the law. What are you, a lawyer now?
102	00:05:09	00:05:11	I don't need to go to law school... What happened to our house?
103	00:05:11	00:05:14	Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
104	00:05:14	00:05:15	And you are...? I'm Marla Hicks.
105	00:05:15	00:05:17	I'm Dwayne and Jimmy's sister.
106	00:05:17	00:05:19	Dwayne and Debbie jacked our house, Marla.
107	00:05:19	00:05:21	Debbie is missing, dumb-ass. What?
108	00:05:21	00:05:23	That is a load of crap. Oh, is it?
109	00:05:23	00:05:26	Okay, he has always been trying to steal from me. Oh, really?
110	00:05:26	00:05:28	Ever since we were kids. Are we going to do this out in front of all these people?
111	00:05:28	00:05:29	Not right now! Jimmy, not right now!
112	00:05:29	00:05:31	...my Hot Wheels, my pot, my Jarts.
113	00:05:31	00:05:34	I loved those Jarts. The Jarts were for both of us.
114	00:05:35	00:05:36	It's a two-man game!
115	00:05:37	00:05:41	A woman is missing, and this fighting is not helping us find her.
116	00:05:41	00:05:43	You know, that's an excellent point.
117	00:05:43	00:05:47	So let's take this family feud downtown.
118	00:05:47	00:05:49	Nice. Talk about pot more in front of cops.
119	00:05:49	00:05:51	Why don't you try and steal the police station?
120	00:05:51	00:05:52	Why don't you both shut up?
121	00:05:52	00:05:53	Shut up, Marla.
122	00:05:53	00:05:54	Oh, funny.
123	00:05:54	00:05:57	A family like that kind of makes me glad I'm an only child.
124	00:05:57	00:05:59	Huh.
125	00:05:59	00:06:04	Well, maybe if we figure out what happened to the house, we'll figure out what happened to the wife.
126	00:06:25	00:06:27	No prints.
127	00:06:27	00:06:29	They didn't even bother to turn the water off.
128	00:06:29	00:06:33	They just sliced right through the pipe.
129	00:06:33	00:06:37	Well, there's four different sets of shoe prints around the house.
130	00:06:37	00:06:39	Is it even possible to move a whole house overnight?
131	00:06:39	00:06:41	Yeah. Yeah, actually, it is.
132	00:06:41	00:06:43	And it's not really that hard to do.
133	00:06:43	00:06:48	Just slide two support beams under the joists, jack it up, lower it onto a flatbed...
134	00:06:50	00:06:52	and off you go.
135	00:06:53	00:06:55	With the wife inside?
136	00:06:55	00:07:00	Yeah, she had to have been unconscious, or she would've heard something, or felt the house moving, don't you think?
137	00:07:00	00:07:02	Unless she was dead.
138	00:07:02	00:07:04	Could be the perfect crime.
139	00:07:04	00:07:06	No body, no crime scene.
140	00:07:06	00:07:08	Debbie is a total bitch.
141	00:07:08	00:07:10	I'm surprised Dwayne's been with her for this long.
142	00:07:10	00:07:12	They're having marital problems?
143	00:07:12	00:07:13	Hell, yeah.
144	00:07:13	00:07:15	At each other's throats night and day.
145	00:07:15	00:07:16	About anything in particular?
146	00:07:16	00:07:18	Money, mostly.
147	00:07:18	00:07:20	You know, Debbie loves her slots.
148	00:07:20	00:07:23	She gambled away their savings.
149	00:07:23	00:07:25	Wow. That must have really pissed Dwayne off.
150	00:07:25	00:07:27	Yeah, I was mad.
151	00:07:27	00:07:29	We lost our condo.
152	00:07:29	00:07:30	We had to move back in with my mother.
153	00:07:30	00:07:32	So the house belongs to your mother.
154	00:07:32	00:07:34	Where is she? She's dead.
155	00:07:34	00:07:36	Oh. Sorry for your loss.
156	00:07:36	00:07:38	So your mom left you the house?
157	00:07:38	00:07:39	She would've.
158	00:07:39	00:07:40	If she had a will.
159	00:07:42	00:07:48	Look, I don't know what my idiot brother told you-- and he is an idiot-- but Debbie swore off gambling, all right?
160	00:07:48	00:07:51	So we... we are in a good place right now.
161	00:07:51	00:07:53	Okay?
162	00:07:53	00:07:54	Oh, really? Yeah.
163	00:07:54	00:07:58	Because there was a disturbance call at the Tasty Time last week, involving you and your wife.
164	00:08:00	00:08:01	All right.
165	00:08:01	00:08:04	Debbie got a little flirty with the fry guy.
166	00:08:04	00:08:07	And she knows how much I hate that.
167	00:08:07	00:08:09	It seems you hate a lot of things about your wife.
168	00:08:09	00:08:11	Maybe enough to want her dead?
169	00:08:11	00:08:14	Look, if I killed my wife, why would I be the one to report her missing?
170	00:08:14	00:08:17	Maybe to throw suspicion off yourself and onto your idiot brother.
171	00:08:17	00:08:19	Well, why don't you find out what he was doing last night?
172	00:08:19	00:08:22	Getting the old rifle cleaned, if you know what I mean.
173	00:08:22	00:08:24	Lucky you. Where? Black Stag.
174	00:08:25	00:08:26	Why make that face?
175	00:08:26	00:08:28	Where'd you go after?
176	00:08:28	00:08:29	Home. Alone?
177	00:08:29	00:08:32	Yeah, alone. Why do you think I had to pay for it?
178	00:08:32	00:08:33	It says here you work in construction?
179	00:08:33	00:08:35	Off and on.
180	00:08:35	00:08:38	I don't know if you've noticed, but not a lot of building going on in Vegas these days.
181	00:08:38	00:08:41	But you have the skills and connections to move a house.
182	00:08:41	00:08:43	And you said, I quote, Debbie's a total bitch.
183	00:08:43	00:08:45	Look, I did not steal that house.
184	00:08:45	00:08:47	And I did not hurt Debbie.
185	00:08:47	00:08:49	I love that you're all up in my business.
186	00:08:49	00:08:51	Have you even talked to Fred?
187	00:08:51	00:08:54	Who's Fred? Fred Blanchard.
188	00:08:54	00:08:56	He and my dad had a dry-cleaning business together.
189	00:08:56	00:08:58	Until my dad stole all their money and took off.
190	00:08:58	00:08:59	When was that?
191	00:08:59	00:09:01	Ten years ago.
192	00:09:01	00:09:03	I haven't seen or heard from him since.
193	00:09:03	00:09:05	Tough growing up without a dad.
194	00:09:05	00:09:07	You didn't know my father.
195	00:09:07	00:09:10	Him leaving was the best thing that ever happened to our family.
196	00:09:10	00:09:11	He was a real son of a bitch.
197	00:09:11	00:09:13	Your brothers think that Fred stole the house.
198	00:09:13	00:09:15	Fred? No.
199	00:09:15	00:09:17	Fred would never do that.
200	00:09:17	00:09:20	He was there for us the second my dad left, and...
201	00:09:20	00:09:24	actually, a few years ago, he and my mom got really close and he moved in.
202	00:09:24	00:09:26	So Fred was living in the house too.
203	00:09:26	00:09:27	Yeah.
204	00:09:27	00:09:29	Until my mom died.
205	00:09:29	00:09:31	And then Dwayne kicked him out.
206	00:09:31	00:09:33	I'm sure it was Debbie's idea.
207	00:09:33	00:09:34	What about you?
208	00:09:34	00:09:36	I mean, no will.
209	00:09:36	00:09:39	The house is just as much yours as it is theirs.
210	00:09:39	00:09:43	I... I don't want any part of that damn house.
211	00:09:43	00:09:44	I'm glad it's gone.
212	00:09:44	00:09:47	You glad Debbie's gone, too?
213	00:09:47	00:09:48	I didn't like her, but...
214	00:09:48	00:09:52	I never wanted anything bad to happen to her.
215	00:09:57	00:10:00	I heard you and Finn worked together in Seattle.
216	00:10:00	00:10:02	Yeah, yeah. Heard right.
217	00:10:02	00:10:04	Rumor has it you fired her.
218	00:10:05	00:10:08	Right again.
219	00:10:08	00:10:11	So that means there's a good story in there somewhere.
220	00:10:11	00:10:13	David! What the hell you got here, buddy?
221	00:10:13	00:10:16	Road kill. Lost an arm and a leg.
222	00:10:16	00:10:18	I.D.? No I.D., but...
223	00:10:18	00:10:20	check out these tread marks.
224	00:10:26	00:10:29	About 22 inches, give or take.
225	00:10:29	00:10:31	This is only sixteen.
226	00:10:31	00:10:36	So our guy was run over by at least one big-rig and maybe a car or two.
227	00:10:36	00:10:38	90 degrees. He's been dead around eight hours.
228	00:10:38	00:10:40	Died last night.
229	00:10:40	00:10:42	Not a lot of streetlights.
230	00:10:42	00:10:44	Would've been hard to see in the dark.
231	00:10:48	00:10:50	Hey, there's a bar back there.
232	00:10:50	00:10:54	Maybe he, uh, hit the hooch and hit the road.
233	00:10:54	00:10:57	You know, for someone who got run over a couple times, I'm not seeing a lot of blood.
234	00:10:57	00:10:59	Hey...
235	00:10:59	00:11:00	Check this out.
236	00:11:01	00:11:02	Blanched skin.
237	00:11:02	00:11:05	His injuries have an orange tone.
238	00:11:05	00:11:07	So the blood wasn't circulating.
239	00:11:07	00:11:08	He was dead before he was run over.
240	00:11:08	00:11:09	Yeah, this isn't a hit-and-run.
241	00:11:09	00:11:11	This is a dump-and-run.
242	00:11:14	00:11:16	528.
243	00:11:16	00:11:18	That's the right address.
244	00:11:18	00:11:21	As opposed to the other houses that were stolen last night?
245	00:11:25	00:11:28	Any of these guys the Hicks brothers or Fred Blanchard?
246	00:11:28	00:11:31	No, but any of them could've hired these guys.
247	00:11:31	00:11:34	Or it was just a random house-stealing.
248	00:11:34	00:11:41	Or maybe Debbie Hicks was still gambling, and she owed somebody some money, and they took her and the house as payment.
249	00:11:41	00:11:42	Let's get a closer look at that guy.
250	00:11:47	00:11:49	Where was this taken?
251	00:11:49	00:11:51	Corner of Sunset and Barlow.
252	00:11:51	00:11:53	But there's no other traffic-cam footage after that.
253	00:11:53	00:11:56	Doesn't mean we can't track it.
254	00:11:56	00:11:57	You must be Finn.
255	00:11:57	00:11:58	You must be Stokes. Yes, ma'am.
256	00:11:58	00:12:00	Hi. David Hodges.
257	00:12:00	00:12:04	Anything you need to know about Sin City, I'm your man.
258	00:12:04	00:12:05	Russell tells me you're quite the insider.
259	00:12:05	00:12:06	Well...
260	00:12:06	00:12:10	Yeah, how did you you duck the sex with animals question on your polygraph?
261	00:12:10	00:12:12	Given your tentacle porn fetish.
262	00:12:12	00:12:14	Yeah.
263	00:12:14	00:12:15	Russell told you about that.
264	00:12:15	00:12:16	Mm-hmm.
265	00:12:16	00:12:18	What do you have for us?
266	00:12:18	00:12:22	Well, it looks like our house thieves were pretty sloppy.
267	00:12:22	00:12:25	I accessed all the 911 calls from last night.
268	00:12:25	00:12:31	Several reports of downed power lines, as well as a dozens of reports of sideswiped cars and other property damage.
269	00:12:31	00:12:34	Looks like Housezilla left quite a path of destruction.
270	00:12:34	00:12:36	Follow the destruction, find the house.
271	00:12:36	00:12:37	Yeah, and maybe Debbie.
272	00:12:45	00:12:46	Hmm...
273	00:12:47	00:12:51	House is heading east.
274	00:12:51	00:12:52	What's over there?
275	00:12:52	00:12:55	About a hundred miles of desert.
276	00:12:55	00:12:57	That's a lot of ground to cover.
277	00:12:57	00:12:59	Not if you have eyes in the sky.
278	00:12:59	00:13:01	I like the way you think.
279	00:13:02	00:13:04	Jim. Stokes.
280	00:13:04	00:13:05	We need a chopper.
281	00:13:27	00:13:28	Will you look at this!
282	00:13:30	00:13:34	You, uh, want to wrap it up, take it back to the lab?
283	00:13:34	00:13:35	Yeah! (laughs)
284	00:13:35	00:13:36	You're still doing that?
285	00:13:36	00:13:38	If it ain't broke.
286	00:13:38	00:13:41	Hook up the satellite, I want to live here.
287	00:13:41	00:13:42	It's nice and quiet.
288	00:13:42	00:13:44	No annoying neighbors.
289	00:13:45	00:13:49	Well, maybe one, but he's quiet.
290	00:13:49	00:13:51	Those are guys' legs.
291	00:13:51	00:13:53	It's definitely not Debbie Hicks.
292	00:13:53	00:13:55	Ruby red shoes.
293	00:13:55	00:13:57	I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
294	00:14:17	00:14:18	Do you need a hand?
295	00:14:18	00:14:19	Oh, no, I've got it.
296	00:14:21	00:14:22	Thanks. I'm Finn.
297	00:14:22	00:14:24	David. Welcome aboard. Thank you.
298	00:14:25	00:14:27	Oh...
299	00:14:27	00:14:29	Chest is completely concave.
300	00:14:29	00:14:31	Obvious death; crushing injuries.
301	00:14:31	00:14:32	Uh-huh. Hmm.
302	00:14:40	00:14:44	These shoes match the impressions I found at the Hicks property.
303	00:14:44	00:14:46	He's definitely one of the house stealers.
304	00:14:46	00:14:47	Has he got an I.D. on him?
305	00:14:55	00:14:57	Dennis Hutchings.
306	00:14:57	00:14:59	I recognize him from the surveillance video.
307	00:15:03	00:15:06	Finn, do me a favor, and get a picture of that jack under there.
308	00:15:06	00:15:09	Okay.
309	00:15:09	00:15:10	Actually, you know what?
310	00:15:10	00:15:13	I think I got something in the truck we can use to get that out of there.
311	00:15:15	00:15:16	I got it.
312	00:15:16	00:15:17	What are you doing?
313	00:15:17	00:15:18	Aw, come on, Jules!
314	00:15:18	00:15:19	Don't call me that!
315	00:15:19	00:15:21	Well, get out from under there, will ya?
316	00:15:22	00:15:23	Unbelievable.
317	00:15:25	00:15:27	Here you go.
318	00:15:27	00:15:30	You know, I bet I know what happened.
319	00:15:30	00:15:37	I bet you they were trying to lower the house, this one got jammed, Mr. Hutchings here tried to fix it.
320	00:15:50	00:15:52	terminal stupidity.
321	00:15:52	00:15:54	karma.
322	00:15:54	00:15:56	Guy steals house, house kills guy.
323	00:15:56	00:15:58	Hey, fellas, lower it back down, will you?
324	00:15:58	00:16:00	Yes, sir! We should probably get in there.
325	00:16:00	00:16:02	It's time to figure out what happened to Debbie Hicks.
326	00:16:14	00:16:17	It's hard to tell if this mess was from a struggle or what.
327	00:16:22	00:16:24	Well, I can tell you that this was...
328	00:16:28	00:16:31	Does not bode well for Debbie.
329	00:16:31	00:16:33	Blood pool's over a liter.
330	00:16:33	00:16:35	Nobody can survive that volume of blood loss.
331	00:16:35	00:16:38	Injuries and death occurred here.
332	00:16:40	00:16:43	Drag marks leading to the kitchen door here.
333	00:16:43	00:16:47	So whoever killed her dumped her body before they dumped the house.
334	00:16:49	00:16:51	High-velocity spatter.
335	00:16:51	00:16:53	If that's from a gunshot, it must have been a revolver.
336	00:16:53	00:16:56	I don't see any casings laying around.
337	00:16:56	00:16:58	Killer could've picked them up, though, right?
338	00:16:58	00:17:00	Yeah.
339	00:17:00	00:17:02	Yeah, one single air bubble.
340	00:17:02	00:17:04	Spatter's not from a shooting.
341	00:17:04	00:17:06	It's expirated blood.
342	00:17:06	00:17:08	So, Debbie coughed up blood during the attack.
343	00:17:08	00:17:10	Can you tell what kind of weapon he used?
344	00:17:10	00:17:16	Well, we have a castoff pattern, relatively short arc-- one, two, three-- could be from a beating.
345	00:17:16	00:17:19	Maybe Debbie put up a fight when Hutchings came to steal the house.
346	00:17:19	00:17:21	He could've brought tools, right?
347	00:17:21	00:17:23	Maybe a hammer, a crowbar.
348	00:17:23	00:17:26	Short castoff arcs with no associated medium-force spatter.
349	00:17:26	00:17:28	Indicative of sharp-force trauma.
350	00:17:28	00:17:30	So you're thinking stabbing.
351	00:17:36	00:17:38	Three castoff events.
352	00:17:38	00:17:39	First stab's always for free.
353	00:17:39	00:17:44	So, that means she was stabbed at least four times, left here to bleed out.
354	00:17:44	00:17:46	Okay, let's back up a second.
355	00:17:46	00:17:51	So, just because Dennis Hutchings stole this house, doesn't mean he's our killer, though, right?
356	00:17:51	00:17:53	No, we got a lot of suspects here, boss.
357	00:17:53	00:17:56	Husband, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, Fred.
358	00:17:56	00:17:58	A whole lot of house to process.
359	00:18:22	00:18:24	Where you planning on sticking that thing?
360	00:18:24	00:18:25	In your mouth. Open up.
361	00:18:25	00:18:27	I don't understand. Why you need my DNA?
362	00:18:27	00:18:28	To prove that you killed my wife.
363	00:18:28	00:18:31	Mr. Hicks, please step back. I'll be with you in a minute.
364	00:18:31	00:18:33	You honestly think I killed Debbie?
365	00:18:33	00:18:35	I want to see you get his DNA good.
366	00:18:35	00:18:37	I'm gonna need to take yours, too.
367	00:18:37	00:18:38	Ha!
368	00:18:38	00:18:39	Why?
369	00:18:39	00:18:42	Well, we need to eliminate everyone who has legitimate access to your house.
370	00:18:42	00:18:43	It's not his house.
371	00:18:43	00:18:45	It is my house. Thanks for saying it.
372	00:18:45	00:18:47	Will you shut up about the house?! Debbie is dead.
373	00:18:47	00:18:49	It's not your house. It is my house.
374	00:18:49	00:18:50	Where's the deed? You can't even read the deed, so...
375	00:18:50	00:18:52	Hey, wait. Hang on a second.
376	00:18:52	00:18:53	Don't you need a warrant or something?
377	00:18:53	00:18:55	Only if you refuse to give it voluntarily.
378	00:18:55	00:18:57	What, are you scared they might find out that you did it?
379	00:18:57	00:19:00	If you didn't do it, you don't have anything to worry about.
380	00:19:00	00:19:01	Look at his face.
381	00:19:01	00:19:02	His wife is dead.
382	00:19:02	00:19:04	Guys... He can't even fake a few tears.
383	00:19:04	00:19:05	You totally did it.
384	00:19:05	00:19:07	Get out of my face. Get out of my face!
385	00:19:07	00:19:08	Stop it! Guys, stop it!
386	00:19:08	00:19:10	Guys! Do you want to spend a night in jail?
387	00:19:10	00:19:12	Be good for you, bro. Get used to it.
388	00:19:12	00:19:13	I want a lawyer.
389	00:19:13	00:19:16	Dwayne?
390	00:19:16	00:19:18	Debbie?!
391	00:19:18	00:19:19	I knew it was too good to be true.
392	00:19:19	00:19:21	You're alive?!
393	00:19:21	00:19:22	What happened to our house?!
394	00:19:22	00:19:25	Wait a second. Where the hell have you been?!
395	00:19:26	00:19:28	I was out gambling with my friend.
396	00:19:28	00:19:30	All night?
397	00:19:30	00:19:33	Well, you lose track of time in the casinos.
398	00:19:33	00:19:35	We may have had a few mojitos.
399	00:19:35	00:19:38	Okay, five.
400	00:19:38	00:19:41	All right, well, I'm gonna need the name of your friend, verify your alibi.
401	00:19:41	00:19:42	Alibi for what?
402	00:19:42	00:19:43	House stealing and murder.
403	00:19:43	00:19:45	Murder?
404	00:19:45	00:19:47	Well, when we found the house, we also found a bloody crime scene.
405	00:19:47	00:19:50	Do you know anything about that?
406	00:19:50	00:19:52	No. No.
407	00:19:52	00:19:55	Last night, I waited for Dwayne to go to work, and then I hit the Strip.
408	00:19:55	00:19:57	The house was spotless.
409	00:19:57	00:19:59	Do you know a guy named Dennis Hutchings?
410	00:19:59	00:20:01	I never heard of him.
411	00:20:01	00:20:02	I didn't kill anybody.
412	00:20:04	00:20:05	Look, when do I get my house back?
413	00:20:05	00:20:09	Mrs. Hicks, like I said, your house is a crime scene.
414	00:20:09	00:20:13	Then you should be talking to Dwayne's idiot brother.
415	00:20:13	00:20:17	If somebody was killed in that house, I bet you 100 bucks he had something to do with it.
416	00:20:17	00:20:20	Well, you know, we thought the blood was yours.
417	00:20:20	00:20:22	So who does it belong to?
418	00:20:27	00:20:31	Amazing how much damage a big rig can do.
419	00:20:31	00:20:33	Good way to dispose of a body.
420	00:20:33	00:20:35	Hopefully, he got a piece of his killer.
421	00:20:35	00:20:37	Well, he definitely got a piece of the murder weapon.
422	00:20:42	00:20:44	Tip of the knife.
423	00:20:45	00:20:48	Non-serrated, single-edged.
424	00:20:48	00:20:49	So he was stabbed.
425	00:20:49	00:20:50	Yeah.
426	00:20:50	00:20:53	Based on my analysis, I found...
427	00:20:53	00:20:55	...four penetrating sharp-force injuries.
428	00:20:55	00:20:58	And you know that how?
429	00:20:58	00:21:01	Uh, Doc Robbins, this is Julie Finlay. Finn.
430	00:21:01	00:21:04	And this here is Fred Blanchard.
431	00:21:04	00:21:05	You I.D.'d my victim?
432	00:21:05	00:21:08	Well, technically, he's actually my victim now.
433	00:21:08	00:21:12	DNA matched Fred here to the large blood pool found at the Hicks' house.
434	00:21:12	00:21:14	The stolen house in the desert?
435	00:21:14	00:21:15	Mm-hmm.
436	00:21:15	00:21:17	This guy was stabbed there?
437	00:21:17	00:21:18	It doesn't make sense.
438	00:21:18	00:21:20	We found him in the middle of a truck route.
439	00:21:20	00:21:22	Yeah, I heard. Can I see your report?
440	00:21:23	00:21:26	Fred Blanchard's body was found right here.
441	00:21:26	00:21:28	And this is the route that the house took.
442	00:21:28	00:21:32	I don't think the drag marks in the kitchen were drag marks.
443	00:21:32	00:21:33	What do you mean?
444	00:21:33	00:21:37	This is hard to see in the dark wood, but if you look at the bottom of the door, that's blood.
445	00:21:37	00:21:42	That would not be there if somebody had dragged the body out because the killer would have opened the door.
446	00:21:42	00:21:44	So they're slide marks.
447	00:21:44	00:21:53	All right, so if Fred's body's in the house while it's moving, he could've slid out the back door when the house made this right turn, right here.
448	00:22:08	00:22:11	We know that Fred Blanchard's our victim.
449	00:22:11	00:22:12	Who's our killer?
450	00:22:12	00:22:17	Well, we have Dennis Hutchings, the dead, not so bright house thief. Right.
451	00:22:17	00:22:20	So Fred comes home, catches Dennis in the act.
452	00:22:20	00:22:21	Dennis kills Fred.
453	00:22:21	00:22:23	Maybe. Maybe.
454	00:22:23	00:22:29	Maybe. Okay. Yeah, the Hicks siblings still have the best motive. All right, Fred is living with the mom. Mom dies.
455	00:22:29	00:22:31	Kids are worried that Fred's gonna take the house from them.
456	00:22:31	00:22:34	Yeah. Debbie and Dwayne kick him out.
457	00:22:34	00:22:36	But that's not a permanent enough solution.
458	00:22:36	00:22:37	Dwayne's alibi's a little shaky.
459	00:22:37	00:22:42	00, but nobody could verify that he spent the whole night there.
460	00:22:42	00:22:44	Debbie's alibi's even shakier.
461	00:22:44	00:22:51	She said that she was drinking and gambling all night but can't remember all the casinos she went to after mojito number three.
462	00:22:54	00:22:56	What?
463	00:22:56	00:22:59	(cell phone chimes) Nothing.
464	00:22:59	00:23:02	Brass just got a lead off Dennis Hutchings' phone records.
465	00:23:02	00:23:05	So, Marla, how do you know Dennis Hutchings?
466	00:23:05	00:23:07	I don't, really.
467	00:23:07	00:23:09	He was just doing a construction job at my school.
468	00:23:09	00:23:11	I'm studying to be a nurse.
469	00:23:11	00:23:14	But you hired him to steal the house.
470	00:23:16	00:23:20	He was after me for months to go out with him.
471	00:23:20	00:23:25	So, finally, I said that I would, if he would do me a favor.
472	00:23:25	00:23:28	Stealing a house; that's a pretty big favor.
473	00:23:28	00:23:31	I didn't mean for anybody to get hurt, really.
474	00:23:31	00:23:33	I didn't know that Fred was gonna be there.
475	00:23:33	00:23:35	I told Dennis to make sure that the house was empty.
476	00:23:35	00:23:40	And he wasn't gonna let anything or anyone get in the way of his date.
477	00:23:40	00:23:42	Fred was like a father to me.
478	00:23:42	00:23:44	I hated the way my family treated him.
479	00:23:44	00:23:46	All because of that stupid house.
480	00:23:46	00:23:49	Okay, well, i-it still doesn't explain why you wanted to steal the house.
481	00:23:49	00:23:51	I didn't think it through.
482	00:23:51	00:23:55	I just wanted the fighting to stop.
483	00:23:55	00:23:59	I mean, my mom's body wasn't even cold before my brothers were arguing over who gets the house.
484	00:23:59	00:24:02	And how could they even want it after it killed her?
485	00:24:03	00:24:05	The house killed your mother?
486	00:24:05	00:24:12	She was... hanging a flower pot on the back porch and it... just collapsed on top of her.
487	00:24:15	00:24:16	Termites.
488	00:24:16	00:24:17	Okay.
489	00:24:17	00:24:21	First your mother, then Fred, then Dennis.
490	00:24:21	00:24:23	That's one killer house.
491	00:24:33	00:24:34	Hey.
492	00:24:34	00:24:36	You my reinforcements? Yep.
493	00:24:36	00:24:37	New marching orders.
494	00:24:37	00:24:41	Doc Robbins found the tip of a knife in Fred Blanchard's rib cage.
495	00:24:41	00:24:46	So Finn was right-- this was a stabbing. Now all we gotta do is find a knife with a missing tip.
496	00:25:37	00:25:39	Morgan.
497	00:25:39	00:25:40	Found something. Murder weapon?
498	00:25:40	00:25:42	No, not exactly.
499	00:25:45	00:25:46	Oh.
500	00:25:47	00:25:50	Whew! Most families keep their skeletons in the closet.
501	00:26:05	00:26:06	Got it? Yeah.
502	00:26:14	00:26:16	This house has killed four people now.
503	00:26:16	00:26:20	The mom, Dennis the home stealer, Fred Blanchard and now this guy.
504	00:26:20	00:26:22	That makes it a serial killer.
505	00:26:22	00:26:28	Based on the height, shoulder width and clothing, looks like an adult male.
506	00:26:28	00:26:31	Fractured skull; possible blunt-force trauma.
507	00:26:40	00:26:41	Calliphoridae.
508	00:26:41	00:26:42	Blowflies.
509	00:26:42	00:26:47	They arrive within minutes of death, which means this guy decomposed in the wall.
510	00:26:47	00:26:50	What are the odds the family didn't know there was a rotting corpse in their wall?
511	00:26:50	00:26:57	Well, given the dehydration and the condition of the body, this guy's been dead at least ten years.
512	00:26:57	00:26:59	Hicks brothers would've been teenagers.
513	00:26:59	00:27:00	Old enough to commit murder.
514	00:27:00	00:27:06	According to Marla Hicks, the dad, Walter, walked out on the family ten years ago.
515	00:27:06	00:27:08	You think this is Walter Hicks?
516	00:27:08	00:27:11	Look, everybody says he was a mean son of a bitch.
517	00:27:11	00:27:15	His wife, his kids, his ex-business partner, Fred, they all hated him.
518	00:27:15	00:27:17	They all had motive.
519	00:27:17	00:27:20	(wry laugh) Maybe he never left.
520	00:27:45	00:27:47	There's some papers in here.
521	00:27:53	00:27:56	Well, they've been exposed to adipocere during decomp.
522	00:27:56	00:27:58	They were holed up in the wall with the body.
523	00:27:58	00:28:00	Could be significant.
524	00:28:00	00:28:02	Yeah. Maybe QD can help restore them.
525	00:28:02	00:28:05	First things first-- let's get our mummy back to the morgue.
526	00:28:38	00:28:41	Okay. Let's run it.
527	00:28:41	00:28:45	Well, based on the tool marks on the mummy's skull, the killer's weapon of choice was a hammer.
528	00:28:45	00:28:48	We did find traces on the mummy's clothing, of sarsaponin.
529	00:28:48	00:28:50	It's from the yucca plant.
530	00:28:50	00:28:52	It's sold commercially to eliminate strong odors.
531	00:28:52	00:28:54	The main distributor is a company called Stink Away.
532	00:28:54	00:28:58	So the killer must have doused him with it, tried to cover up the stench of decomp.
533	00:28:58	00:29:03	So it is possible that the family didn't notice the rotting corpse in the wall. DNA results.
534	00:29:03	00:29:06	Really?
535	00:29:07	00:29:09	So it's Walter Hicks?
536	00:29:09	00:29:10	Uh, maybe, maybe not.
537	00:29:10	00:29:12	Here's where it gets really interesting.
538	00:29:12	00:29:15	I compared his DNA to all three of the Hicks siblings.
539	00:29:15	00:29:21	It turns out our mummy is the biological daddy of Marla but not Dwayne and Jimmy.
540	00:29:21	00:29:23	Uh-oh. Well...
541	00:29:23	00:29:25	looks like Lois Hicks stepped out on her husband.
542	00:29:25	00:29:29	Okay. We still don't know who the mummy is or who killed him.
543	00:29:29	00:29:30	And we still don't know who killed Fred.
544	00:29:30	00:29:32	Actually, I may have a lead on that.
545	00:29:32	00:29:35	Epthelials under Fred's nails belonged to one of the Hicks brothers.
546	00:29:37	00:29:38	Fred attacked me.
547	00:29:38	00:29:40	Look, that's how I got these.
548	00:29:40	00:29:43	That's why you're reluctant to give us your DNA.
549	00:29:43	00:29:46	You were afraid we were gonna connect you to Fred.
550	00:29:46	00:29:49	Like I told you, he attacked me.
551	00:29:49	00:29:51	I'd like to believe you, Dwayne.
552	00:29:51	00:29:52	I really would.
553	00:29:52	00:29:54	But Fred is dead.
554	00:29:54	00:29:58	And more than likely you got those scratches because he was struggling for his life.
555	00:29:58	00:29:59	I didn't kill Fred.
556	00:29:59	00:30:01	Come on, Dwayne, you kicked him out of his own house.
557	00:30:01	00:30:04	Hey, that is not his house!
558	00:30:04	00:30:06	When Mom died, he should've left on his own.
559	00:30:06	00:30:09	So... so what? I gave him a little push.
560	00:30:09	00:30:12	Dwayne, stop it! You can't do this.
561	00:30:12	00:30:14	Yeah, I can. Here, Fred, take your stuff and get out.
562	00:30:14	00:30:17	If your mother were here, she'd be so ashamed of you all.
563	00:30:17	00:30:19	Yeah, well, she's not here-- she's dead. Time for you to go.
564	00:30:19	00:30:21	You cannot just kick Fred out!
565	00:30:21	00:30:22	This is his house too.
566	00:30:22	00:30:23	Shut up, Marla!
567	00:30:23	00:30:26	This is our family home, and he is not part of our family!
568	00:30:29	00:30:31	Oh, man.
569	00:30:31	00:30:33	You kicked him out of the house in the morning.
570	00:30:33	00:30:35	He came back at night, right?
571	00:30:35	00:30:37	Maybe to get his things?
572	00:30:37	00:30:39	And that's when you killed him.
573	00:30:39	00:30:40	Hey, that's a great story.
574	00:30:40	00:30:42	That's your story; I'm sticking with my story.
575	00:30:42	00:30:47	And if you don't believe me, you can ask Debbie, you can ask Marla, ask them both.
576	00:30:47	00:30:51	No prints in the house belonging to anyone outside of the family, and no sign of the murder weapon.
577	00:30:51	00:30:53	Nick and I searched every inch of that house.
578	00:30:53	00:30:56	Okay, so blood spatter tells us that Fred was killed in the kitchen.
579	00:30:56	00:30:59	Tip of the knife broke off in his chest.
580	00:30:59	00:31:02	Maybe the killer... took the knife with him.
581	00:31:02	00:31:04	Oh, wait a minute...
582	00:31:04	00:31:08	maybe the knife was still in his chest when he slid out of the house.
583	00:31:08	00:31:10	And broke off when he got run over.
584	00:31:10	00:31:12	Which means the knife would still be out on that road.
585	00:31:12	00:31:14	Okay, expand the search area.
586	00:31:14	00:31:17	And you can take boyfriend Greg with you.
587	00:31:41	00:31:42	Part of the blade.
588	00:31:42	00:31:47	Blood on it. If we can find the other piece of the handle, maybe we can get some DNA, prints.
589	00:32:03	00:32:05	Well, I found one piece.
590	00:32:10	00:32:11	This is gonna take a while.
591	00:32:41	00:32:43	Ridge detail.
592	00:32:43	00:32:45	You any good at jigsaw puzzles?
593	00:32:45	00:32:48	My dad gave me one for my eighth birthday.
594	00:32:48	00:32:49	Empire State Building, thousand pieces.
595	00:32:49	00:32:51	Did it in six hours. By myself.
596	00:32:51	00:32:53	Let's see if we can break your record.
597	00:33:12	00:33:14	Got a partial.
598	00:33:14	00:33:15	We've gotten AFIS hits off of less.
599	00:33:38	00:33:40	I hear you're gonna blow my mind.
600	00:33:40	00:33:44	Blood on the knife is a match to our vic, Fred Blanchard.
601	00:33:44	00:33:46	Which means it's definitely the murder weapon.
602	00:33:46	00:33:48	Not exactly blowing my mind.
603	00:33:48	00:33:49	Oh, we're getting there.
604	00:33:49	00:33:52	We recovered a partial print off of the handle of the knife.
605	00:33:52	00:33:55	It didn't match Dwayne Hicks.
606	00:33:55	00:33:56	So, we have three other Hicks, right?
607	00:33:56	00:33:59	Debbie, Jimmy, and Marla.
608	00:33:59	00:34:02	None of the above. Really?
609	00:34:02	00:34:04	But we did get a hit in AFIS.
610	00:34:04	00:34:10	Prints came back to a long-lost member of the Hicks family.
611	00:34:10	00:34:11	Walter.
612	00:34:11	00:34:12	Whoa.
613	00:34:12	00:34:15	Dear old not-so-dead Dad.
614	00:34:15	00:34:17	My mind is blown.
615	00:34:17	00:34:20	He was in the system for assaulting a guy in a bar fight 15 years ago.
616	00:34:20	00:34:24	So now we know the mummy in the wall isn't Walter.
617	00:34:26	00:34:28	So who is he?
618	00:34:34	00:34:36	Walter Hicks is alive and well.
619	00:34:36	00:34:38	Came back to town... killed Fred.
620	00:34:38	00:34:39	Did he kill the mummy, too?
621	00:34:39	00:34:41	We still have no idea who that is.
622	00:34:41	00:34:44	Well, at least we know that the mummy is Marla Hicks' father.
623	00:34:44	00:34:47	If Walter found out about it, that is motive.
624	00:34:47	00:34:54	Yeah. Yeah, and-and I sent the papers walled up with the mummy to QD. If I can restore them, I bet they'll help us figure out who the guy is.
625	00:35:24	00:35:27	So you're saying that Walter isn't my real dad?
626	00:35:27	00:35:29	That's what I'm saying, yeah.
627	00:35:29	00:35:32	Your biological father's name was Tony Perrella.
628	00:35:32	00:35:34	He was a-a handyman.
629	00:35:34	00:35:36	Did some work around your house.
630	00:35:36	00:35:39	My mother had sex with some handyman?
631	00:35:39	00:35:41	I think it was a lot more than that.
632	00:35:41	00:35:43	I think she and Tony were the real deal.
633	00:35:43	00:35:45	I found some letters that he wrote to her.
634	00:35:45	00:35:47	You, uh, you want to take a look?
635	00:35:50	00:35:52	Thank you.
636	00:35:52	00:35:56	I never believed in soul mates until I met you.
637	00:35:59	00:36:05	When you told me you loved me, I felt like the luckiest man in the world.
638	00:36:05	00:36:07	I can't wait to start our life together.
639	00:36:10	00:36:11	Sounds to me like she really loved him.
640	00:36:11	00:36:14	I think she was even going to leave Walter for him.
641	00:36:14	00:36:18	Yeah, and the little we know of Walter, that was a very good decision.
642	00:36:18	00:36:22	Tony was reported missing on March 20, 1991.
643	00:36:24	00:36:26	I was born in November.
644	00:36:26	00:36:30	So my mother probably didn't even know that she was pregnant when he was murdered.
645	00:36:30	00:36:38	She probably thought Tony left her because he was tired of waiting on her to leave Walter, you know what I mean?
646	00:36:38	00:36:39	Yeah, it must have been hard on her.
647	00:36:39	00:36:41	Losing somebody that she loved that much.
648	00:36:44	00:36:46	My mother always had this sadness about her.
649	00:36:49	00:36:50	Now I know why.
650	00:36:56	00:36:58	You know, it's funny.
651	00:36:58	00:37:02	When we were looking for you, we couldn't find any record of a Walter Hicks since 2002.
652	00:37:02	00:37:09	But then we ran your full name, Walter Douglas Hicks, and wouldn't you know it, there's a Walter Douglas living in New Mexico.
653	00:37:09	00:37:14	Who just happened to use his credit card here in Vegas two days ago.
654	00:37:14	00:37:15	So it's been ten years, Walter.
655	00:37:15	00:37:17	What brings you back to the city?
656	00:37:17	00:37:18	Gambling? Nightlife?
657	00:37:18	00:37:20	Or... maybe this.
658	00:37:20	00:37:22	CSI found it in your old house.
659	00:37:24	00:37:26	I haven't lived there in ten years.
660	00:37:26	00:37:29	Tony Perrella's been dead for 20. Who?
661	00:37:29	00:37:30	Your handyman.
662	00:37:30	00:37:34	We have some invoices here that said Tony spent a lot of time at your house.
663	00:37:34	00:37:35	Doing repairs.
664	00:37:35	00:37:37	Your wife.
665	00:37:37	00:37:41	We also found love letters that Tony wrote to your wife.
666	00:37:41	00:37:44	I'm pretty sure you found them too, right?
667	00:37:44	00:37:47	And that's why you killed him.
668	00:37:47	00:37:49	Love letters? That's all you got?
669	00:37:49	00:37:51	No, actually, we have a lot more.
670	00:37:51	00:37:52	We have some, uh, some receipts.
671	00:37:52	00:37:58	For some, uh, 2x4s, spackling, drywall, from a local hardware store.
672	00:37:58	00:38:00	Right around the time that Tony was reported missing.
673	00:38:02	00:38:06	Yeah, don't forget that large bottle of Stink Away. Stink Away. Right here.
674	00:38:06	00:38:09	Ravenson Hardware keeps impeccable records.
675	00:38:09	00:38:11	You remember Tony now?
676	00:38:15	00:38:19	Lois took the boys to her mother for the week.
677	00:38:19	00:38:22	I... got Tony to come to the house.
678	00:38:22	00:38:23	You think you can screw my wife?
679	00:38:23	00:38:25	Huh? I love Lois.
680	00:38:25	00:38:27	You don't give a damn about her. You stay the hell away from her.
681	00:38:27	00:38:29	He said he wanted to fight for her.
682	00:38:32	00:38:33	He lost.
683	00:38:51	00:38:53	You got away with murder.
684	00:38:53	00:38:55	Too bad Lois died, right?
685	00:38:55	00:38:58	Probably got a little worried, maybe someone'd buy the house and find the body.
686	00:38:58	00:39:00	So you came back to move it.
687	00:39:00	00:39:03	And guess who shows up.
688	00:39:03	00:39:06	Your old business partner, Fred.
689	00:39:06	00:39:09	What the hell are you doing here?
690	00:39:09	00:39:12	Heard about Lois.
691	00:39:12	00:39:14	What? And you came to pay your respects?
692	00:39:14	00:39:16	You never cared about her when she was alive.
693	00:39:16	00:39:18	Why start now?
694	00:39:18	00:39:20	We know what happens when you lose your temper.
695	00:39:20	00:39:22	Somebody ends up dead.
696	00:39:22	00:39:28	Fred threatened to call the cops about a financial dispute we had ten years ago.
697	00:39:28	00:39:33	Financial dispute? Oh, you mean that's when you stole all the money out of your business account and left Fred with nothing?
698	00:39:33	00:39:35	I didn't want to go to jail.
699	00:39:37	00:39:39	Take your hands off of me.
700	00:39:45	00:39:50	You come back to move the mummy out of the wall, but you leave a fresh body in the kitchen?
701	00:39:50	00:39:52	I heard this big truck pull up outside.
702	00:39:52	00:39:54	And I had to get out of there in a hurry.
703	00:39:54	00:39:56	Yeah, that would be the house stealers.
704	00:39:57	00:39:59	It's... long story.
705	00:39:59	00:40:02	You know, you're a very mean, angry man, Mr. Hicks.
706	00:40:02	00:40:03	And anger's like a toxin.
707	00:40:03	00:40:09	It poisons everything it touches, especially your family and also that house of yours.
708	00:40:09	00:40:12	Prison is full of mean and angry people, Walter.
709	00:40:12	00:40:13	So you'll fit right in.
710	00:40:23	00:40:24	You are not seriously doing this!
711	00:40:24	00:40:25	I'm going after him. Hey! Hey!
712	00:40:25	00:40:26	Yeah, that's gonna help.
713	00:40:26	00:40:27	Do not do this. Stuff is in there.
714	00:40:27	00:40:29	What? You're gonna lock our stuff in there?
715	00:40:29	00:40:30	Oh, great, look at this.
716	00:40:30	00:40:32	Jimmy? Seriously? Look at this.
717	00:40:32	00:40:33	You're so dumb. ...coming back.
718	00:40:33	00:40:35	No...!
719	00:40:35	00:40:37	Thank you for coming. I didn't know who else to call.
720	00:40:37	00:40:39	You cannot change the locks on this house!
721	00:40:39	00:40:40	It's not your house, dumb-ass!
722	00:40:40	00:40:43	Like you said, bro, possessing is nine-tenths of the law.
723	00:40:43	00:40:47	Thank you.
724	00:40:47	00:40:48	Hey, arrest him, he's squatting.
725	00:40:48	00:40:50	Hell, shoot him. Yeah.
726	00:40:50	00:40:51	No, no, no... No one is shooting anyone.
727	00:40:51	00:40:53	It is just a house.
728	00:40:53	00:40:54	It's not worth killing each other.
729	00:40:54	00:40:55	Shut up, Marla.
730	00:40:55	00:40:57	You're not even our real sister anymore.
731	00:40:57	00:40:58	Yeah, you're barely family, okay?
732	00:40:58	00:41:01	We have the same mother, you idiots.
733	00:41:01	00:41:03	Hey, are you guys gonna do anything?
734	00:41:03	00:41:04	Do something. What are you doing?
735	00:41:04	00:41:06	Good.
736	00:41:06	00:41:08	You are so dumb.
737	00:41:08	00:41:10	Why are you still doing that? Get off my lawn.
738	00:41:10	00:41:11	This is not your lawn. It's the desert.
739	00:41:11	00:41:14	Get off my desert. SIDLE Finn, um...
740	00:41:17	00:41:19	You each want a piece of the house?
741	00:41:19	00:41:20	Great. Let's divvy it up.
742	00:41:20	00:41:21	What do you want?
743	00:41:21	00:41:22	You want the living room and the dining room?
744	00:41:22	00:41:24	Yeah? No!
745	00:41:24	00:41:26	Would you like the bedroom and the bathroom maybe?
746	00:41:26	00:41:27	Hey, hey, hey!
747	00:41:27	00:41:29	I'm just gonna chop it right in half.
748	00:41:29	00:41:30	You can't chop up our house.
749	00:41:30	00:41:31	Okay. Is that good?
750	00:41:37	00:41:40	Or, you know, there's another way to settle this.
751	00:41:40	00:41:44	This house caused a lot of damage on the way up here.
752	00:41:44	00:41:45	Over $100,000.
753	00:41:45	00:41:48	Whoever owns the house gets the bill.
754	00:41:48	00:41:50	Wait... the house isn't even worth that much.
755	00:41:50	00:41:52	She stole it.
756	00:41:52	00:41:53	Yeah, give her the bill.
757	00:41:53	00:41:54	What?!
758	00:41:54	00:41:56	I never even wanted this house.
759	00:42:02	00:42:08	And then we told Marla that she could donate the house to a charity or the city, so she doesn't have to pay the bill.
760	00:42:08	00:42:10	Smart.
761	00:42:10	00:42:12	It was actually Sara's idea.
762	00:42:12	00:42:16	Probably didn't hurt to have some crazy lady running around with a chainsaw.
763	00:42:16	00:42:17	You heard?
764	00:42:17	00:42:19	Yeah, I heard.
765	00:42:19	00:42:21	A little too familiar.
766	00:42:24	00:42:25	I don't get it.
767	00:42:25	00:42:27	What's that?
768	00:42:27	00:42:32	Well, I've been walking around this place the last couple days, trying to find the problem.
769	00:42:32	00:42:34	This place is like a family.
770	00:42:34	00:42:35	You've got the best of the best.
771	00:42:35	00:42:36	That's true.
772	00:42:36	00:42:41	So why... why'd you bring me here?
773	00:42:41	00:42:43	Best of the best can always get better.
774	00:42:43	00:42:46	Right?
775	00:42:46	00:42:49	You know that's only half an answer.
776	00:42:49	00:42:51	Jules, let's not do this.
777	00:42:51	00:42:54	I just don't want history to repeat itself.
778	00:42:54	00:42:56	Well, that makes two of us.
