0	00:00:02	00:00:03	It doesn't have to be this way.
1	00:00:03	00:00:05	Just listen to reason.
2	00:00:05	00:00:08	I have no use for reason...
3	00:00:08	00:00:10	puny human!
4	00:00:10	00:00:12	The Selbachian ship is almost within range.
5	00:00:12	00:00:16	And this vessel shall be the instrument of my revenge.
6	00:00:17	00:00:25	Turn your weapon systems over to me now, or I will kill one of your crew every 2.5 Earth minutes, beginning with the female.
7	00:00:26	00:00:27	Commander?
8	00:00:28	00:00:29	It's going to be all right.
9	00:00:47	00:00:50	All stations secure from general quarters.
10	00:00:53	00:00:54	A pleasure working with you, Yeoman.
11	00:00:54	00:00:56	As always.
12	00:00:56	00:00:59	We're talking about a piece of television history.
13	00:00:59	00:01:07	The actual Spaceforce microprobe Commander Artemis Bishop used to subdue the alien Gorth in the season 2 finale of Astro Quest.
14	00:01:07	00:01:10	And it can all be yours for just $750.
15	00:01:10	00:01:11	750?
16	00:01:11	00:01:13	Do I look like an idiot to you?
17	00:01:30	00:01:32	That's nice!
18	00:01:35	00:01:36	Welcome, Whatifitconners.
19	00:01:37	00:01:44	Redux will begin in Room 21-B in just a few minutes.
20	00:02:01	00:02:03	Nice uniform.
21	00:02:03	00:02:06	Wendy?
22	00:02:14	00:02:18	You're Yeoman Malloy.
23	00:02:18	00:02:21	You have a microprobe.
24	00:02:23	00:02:25	I can't believe this.
25	00:02:25	00:02:26	You're a Questor?
26	00:02:27	00:02:30	I think Astro Quest is the greatest science fiction show of all time.
27	00:02:30	00:02:33	I'm a Commander Bishop fan myself.
28	00:02:33	00:02:34	Who isn't?
29	00:02:34	00:02:36	Why Malloy?
30	00:02:36	00:02:37	I loved her.
31	00:02:37	00:02:44	I mean, I know that she was completely underwritten, but she was the only female biochemist on TV and I liked her spunk.
32	00:02:44	00:02:48	Do you think that, um, I got the collar right?
33	00:02:48	00:02:51	'Cause I think on the show that it might've been a little more, um, swoopy.
34	00:02:52	00:02:55	You... It looks perfect.
35	00:02:55	00:02:56	Thanks.
36	00:02:58	00:03:00	Can I see that?
37	00:03:04	00:03:06	(whirring) Wow...
38	00:03:06	00:03:09	That's great.
39	00:03:09	00:03:16	Jihw-CHOK chom-CHEM jag-eej BRYCE cichoki.
40	00:03:16	00:03:18	I don't speak Vellikon.
41	00:03:18	00:03:19	What did you say?
42	00:03:22	00:03:25	Security to Room 21-B immediately. Oh, my God, Jon?
43	00:03:25	00:03:28	Security, 21-B immediately... Jon?!
44	00:03:28	00:03:31	We need medical personnel in 21-B. Jon?!
45	00:03:31	00:03:33	Medical personnel in 21-B. Jon? Jon? Wake up!
46	00:03:33	00:03:36	What is the matter with you? Oh, my God. Speak to me!
47	00:03:36	00:03:38	Jon?
48	00:03:38	00:03:39	Jon? Excuse me. Excuse me.
49	00:03:39	00:03:41	Excuse me. Excuse me. Wake up! Wake up!
50	00:03:41	00:03:44	Please, everyone stay calm and stay back.
51	00:03:44	00:03:45	We're with the Crime Lab.
52	00:03:45	00:03:46	Ma'am, don't touch anything.
53	00:03:46	00:03:48	Don't... Jon!
54	00:03:48	00:03:49	Please, come with me.
55	00:03:49	00:03:50	Jon. Come with me. Come with me.
56	00:03:53	00:03:54	Brass.
57	00:03:54	00:03:55	Yeah, it's Hodges.
58	00:03:55	00:03:56	Who? From Trace.
59	00:03:56	00:03:58	We have a situation at the Whatifitcon.
60	00:03:58	00:03:59	The Whatifit-what?
61	00:04:00	00:04:01	How'd you get this number?
62	00:04:01	00:04:03	I cloned Grissom's cell phone on a work-related matter.
63	00:04:03	00:04:04	That's not important now.
64	00:04:04	00:04:05	We have a situation.
65	00:04:05	00:04:07	It's one of the exhibitors.
66	00:04:07	00:04:09	Could you be more specific?
67	00:04:11	00:04:13	He's dead, Jim.
68	00:04:55	00:05:01	Jonathan Danson, 36, from Chowchilla, California.
69	00:05:01	00:05:03	42 bucks and a couple of credit cards.
70	00:05:03	00:05:06	So it probably wasn't a robbery.
71	00:05:10	00:05:11	Bloody nose, scratches on the face.
72	00:05:11	00:05:13	This guy's been in a fight or something.
73	00:05:13	00:05:17	You know, if there was a struggle it'd be really hard to tell on a set like this.
74	00:05:18	00:05:20	Liver temp was 89.7 degrees.
75	00:05:20	00:05:22	00 a.m.
76	00:05:22	00:05:26	So, between then and now there's probably been a few thousand people with access to this booth.
77	00:05:26	00:05:27	You're going to need a lot of tape lifts.
78	00:05:27	00:05:29	And swabs.
79	00:05:29	00:05:31	Or...
80	00:05:31	00:05:37	I could run a vacuum cleaner over the whole scene, get exemplars from all these folks and keep you two knuckleheads busy for the next few months.
81	00:05:37	00:05:40	How'd that be? Hmm?
82	00:05:41	00:05:46	beam yourselves back to the lab and let us do our job, please.
83	00:05:46	00:05:47	Okay.
84	00:05:47	00:05:49	Thank you.
85	00:05:49	00:05:51	Nice outfit.
86	00:05:51	00:05:52	I just can't believe it.
87	00:05:52	00:05:55	I mean, this-this project was Jonathan's dream.
88	00:05:55	00:05:57	We were so close.
89	00:05:57	00:05:58	So close to what?
90	00:05:58	00:06:00	He spent five years on this pilot.
91	00:06:00	00:06:02	It's a remake of the original Astro Quest.
92	00:06:03	00:06:08	An executive from Paramount approached us about it-- turning it into a full-on series for the CW.
93	00:06:08	00:06:10	Oh, yeah, really? No kidding.
94	00:06:10	00:06:15	Produced by Jonathan Danson and Melinda Carver.
95	00:06:15	00:06:18	So, do you have a financial interest in the project?
96	00:06:18	00:06:21	Well, yeah, I financed it.
97	00:06:21	00:06:23	So, what happens to the rights with Jonathan out of the picture?
98	00:06:23	00:06:26	They revert to me, I guess.
99	00:06:26	00:06:27	What are you getting at?
100	00:06:27	00:06:29	Exactly what you think I am.
101	00:06:35	00:06:39	A guy in a red shirt dies at the beginning of most Astro Quest episodes.
102	00:06:39	00:06:41	I remember.
103	00:06:41	00:06:42	Come on in.
104	00:06:42	00:06:44	Thanks.
105	00:06:44	00:06:45	Take a look.
106	00:06:47	00:06:50	Perimortem bruise on the neck.
107	00:06:52	00:06:53	And a...
108	00:06:53	00:06:57	right-angled laceration at the base of the nostrils.
109	00:06:57	00:07:01	The skin appears to be split, not cut.
110	00:07:03	00:07:05	There's metallic trace in the wound.
111	00:07:24	00:07:28	You and Wendy always go to Whatifitcon together?
112	00:07:28	00:07:30	Actually, it was our first.
113	00:07:53	00:07:55	Pleasure working with you, Yeoman.
114	00:07:55	00:07:57	As always.
115	00:07:57	00:07:59	Tell me something, Commander.
116	00:08:04	00:08:05	Were you scared?
117	00:08:05	00:08:07	I wasn't before.
118	00:08:10	00:08:12	But I am now.
119	00:08:12	00:08:14	But you're my commanding officer.
120	00:08:14	00:08:17	(shudders) I'm also a man.
121	00:08:18	00:08:19	With a man's needs.
122	00:08:19	00:08:24	If you only knew how many nights I lay awake dreaming of a moment like this.
123	00:08:24	00:08:27	Oh... I can guess.
124	00:08:27	00:08:29	Hodges, you forgot this.
125	00:08:29	00:08:31	GCMS, chop-chop.
126	00:08:42	00:08:48	My name is Jonathan Danson, and I'm here to set you free.
127	00:08:48	00:08:55	Free from a vision of an antiseptic future filled with...
128	00:08:55	00:09:04	with heroes and heroines who are always steadfast and well-adjusted and altruistic.
129	00:09:04	00:09:06	When was this taken?
130	00:09:06	00:09:08	Last night, special preview event.
131	00:09:08	00:09:14	Anything interesting happens at a sci-fi convention, it's online somewhere about five seconds later.
132	00:09:14	00:09:20	Like most of you, I grew up with Astro Quest.
133	00:09:20	00:09:25	Every Thursday night my dad would gather the family around our TV to watch the latest episode.
134	00:09:25	00:09:28	I loved it.
135	00:09:28	00:09:35	But the older I got, the more the mythology began to eat away at my soul.
136	00:09:35	00:09:41	I couldn't measure up to the brave crew of that perfect ship.
137	00:09:41	00:09:43	I wasn't handsome, courageous, strong.
138	00:09:43	00:09:47	I was weak, petty, self-destructive.
139	00:09:47	00:09:50	And I hated myself for it.
140	00:09:50	00:09:53	But then...
141	00:09:53	00:09:55	One night...
142	00:09:55	00:09:58	it hit me like a... like a bolt of lightning.
143	00:09:58	00:10:02	I looked around the bar at the other frightened, sad people and I...
144	00:10:02	00:10:06	and I said to myself, Do you see an Artemis Bishop here?
145	00:10:06	00:10:08	Do you see one at work?
146	00:10:08	00:10:10	What's this? He's showing the Redux.
147	00:10:10	00:10:12	Uh, in your apartment building or on the street?
148	00:10:12	00:10:15	People, look around you.
149	00:10:15	00:10:18	Do you see an Artemis Bishop anywhere?
150	00:10:18	00:10:20	Of course not.
151	00:10:20	00:10:22	Because he's a fictional construct.
152	00:10:22	00:10:26	A phantom who whispers, You are not enough.
153	00:10:28	00:10:33	Well, I am here to show you who we really are.
154	00:10:33	00:10:35	Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...
155	00:10:36	00:10:39	Redux.
156	00:10:46	00:10:48	I swear to God I'm gonna do her!
157	00:10:48	00:10:50	Garth, you know me. Just stand down.
158	00:10:50	00:10:51	I don't know anything anymore!
159	00:10:51	00:10:53	I'm gonna do her.
160	00:10:53	00:10:54	I swear I'm gonna do her! Commander...
161	00:10:54	00:10:58	Okay, Sally, everything's gonna be all right.
162	00:11:01	00:11:04	Nothing's ever gonna be all right again!
163	00:11:04	00:11:06	Do you see that?!
164	00:11:06	00:11:09	Now you're gonna do what I want.
165	00:11:28	00:11:29	You suck.
166	00:11:29	00:11:30	You don't have the...
167	00:11:33	00:11:34	Do you get it?
168	00:11:37	00:11:41	We're not gonna watch that crap! Get outta here!
169	00:11:41	00:11:42	So let me get this straight.
170	00:11:42	00:11:57	Some nerd takes a cheesy, '60s sci-fi show and turns it into something a little bit more realistic-- minus the spaceship, of course-- and the other nerds get pissed off enough that they beat him up and kill him over it?
171	00:11:57	00:12:02	Well... people don't like it when you mess with their heroes.
172	00:12:16	00:12:18	You got something, Riley?
173	00:12:18	00:12:20	Hmm...
174	00:12:20	00:12:23	No sign of blood.
175	00:12:23	00:12:26	I doubt it's the murder weapon.
176	00:12:31	00:12:36	Are we going to have to figure out how many Dumpsters 3,000 people can fill in three days?
177	00:12:36	00:12:38	Boy, I hope not.
178	00:12:40	00:12:43	Whoa.
179	00:12:43	00:12:44	I got a...
180	00:12:44	00:12:47	whole lot of geek love on the command chair.
181	00:12:47	00:12:50	Isn't that nice for them?
182	00:12:50	00:12:53	I just found A/V central.
183	00:12:53	00:12:56	DVD player, sound gear.
184	00:13:00	00:13:02	And the vic's laptop.
185	00:13:05	00:13:07	There's a DVD in the player.
186	00:13:09	00:13:15	According to Article 13 of the Planetary Alliance Charter, we find Jonathan Danson guilty of high treason.
187	00:13:15	00:13:17	This wasn't part of the presentation.
188	00:13:17	00:13:20	And the penalty is...
189	00:13:20	00:13:21	Please!
190	00:13:21	00:13:22	No!
191	00:13:22	00:13:24	I'm sorry!
192	00:13:25	00:13:27	I won't ever do it again!
193	00:13:27	00:13:31	Don't kill me, please!
194	00:13:34	00:13:37	I got to start watching this show.
195	00:13:37	00:13:39	Sic Semper Tradi torae.
196	00:13:39	00:13:40	Death to traitors.
197	00:13:45	00:13:46	(knocking) Yeah?
198	00:13:46	00:13:54	Uh, Catherine, um, hypothetically, if I knew of someone in the lab having a relationship...
199	00:13:54	00:13:55	What kind of a relationship?
200	00:13:55	00:13:58	Um... personal.
201	00:13:58	00:13:59	Affectionate.
202	00:13:59	00:14:00	Romantic?
203	00:14:00	00:14:02	Okay.
204	00:14:02	00:14:08	Um, hypothetically, if I knew of someone in the lab having a romantic relationship...
205	00:14:10	00:14:13	...would I be obligated to report them?
206	00:14:13	00:14:14	Yes.
207	00:14:14	00:14:16	To Ecklie.
208	00:14:17	00:14:21	And, hypothetically, would they suffer consequences?
209	00:14:22	00:14:23	Are they hypothetically on the same shift?
210	00:14:23	00:14:24	Yes.
211	00:14:24	00:14:26	Supervisor-subordinate? No.
212	00:14:26	00:14:28	Then one of them will have to change shifts.
213	00:14:28	00:14:31	But other than that, they should be fine.
214	00:14:31	00:14:35	Just tell them to report it to Ecklie and to go for it.
215	00:14:35	00:14:37	Life's too short, right?
216	00:15:06	00:15:12	So what's a college professor Redux at a science fiction convention?
217	00:15:13	00:15:14	I was there with my crew.
218	00:15:14	00:15:19	I'm making a documentary on the gestalt constructs of sci-fi mytho-cultures.
219	00:15:19	00:15:20	Really?
220	00:15:20	00:15:22	Have a seat. Thank you.
221	00:15:22	00:15:25	I wanted to talk to you about your video.
222	00:15:25	00:15:31	The crowd didn't seem to like Danson's new take on their old mythology.
223	00:15:31	00:15:34	Danson was a provocateur.
224	00:15:34	00:15:36	I actually loved his boldness. But he was playing with fire.
225	00:15:36	00:15:40	You believe one of these people killed him?
226	00:15:40	00:15:42	Would you believe it?
227	00:15:43	00:15:47	To its fans, Astro Quest is more than just a television show.
228	00:15:47	00:15:49	It's a religion.
229	00:15:49	00:15:57	When he screened his Redux, that was the sci-fi equivalent of Martin Luther nailing his 95 Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg.
230	00:15:57	00:16:01	That's keeping it in perspective.
231	00:16:01	00:16:06	People kill each other all the time over belief systems, Mr. Sanders.
232	00:16:06	00:16:08	Or perhaps you're not familiar with the Middle East.
233	00:16:08	00:16:12	C.O.D. was cerebral hemorrhage due to blunt-force trauma.
234	00:16:12	00:16:21	Sharp blow to the nasal bone snapped the nasofrontal suture, driving it into the frontal sinus, where a secondary fracture penetrated the frontal lobe.
235	00:16:21	00:16:23	Instant unconsciousness.
236	00:16:23	00:16:25	He was dead within minutes.
237	00:16:25	00:16:27	Any idea what hit him?
238	00:16:27	00:16:29	Something angular, silver-colored.
239	00:16:29	00:16:30	We haven't found the murder weapon yet.
240	00:16:30	00:16:33	Uh, David, would you finish stitching him up, please?
241	00:16:33	00:16:34	I'm not a seamstress.
242	00:16:34	00:16:36	I'm a coroner's investigator, damn it. (sighs)
243	00:16:36	00:16:39	He's been doing that all day.
244	00:16:39	00:16:43	He's riffing Corpsman Scully's one-liners from Astro Quest.
245	00:16:43	00:16:44	Didn't watch it much.
246	00:16:44	00:16:46	Because you're not a couch potato.
247	00:16:46	00:16:48	You're a medical examiner, damn it.
248	00:16:48	00:16:53	Well, he was obviously in some kind of struggle.
249	00:16:53	00:16:55	What do you make of this contusion here?
250	00:16:55	00:16:57	It's on a pressure point.
251	00:16:57	00:17:00	Maybe someone attempted a sleeper hold.
252	00:17:00	00:17:03	You mean like a Sethlan submission claw?
253	00:17:03	00:17:04	That's real?
254	00:17:05	00:17:07	Well, you tell me.
255	00:17:09	00:17:10	Aah! Okay!
256	00:17:10	00:17:11	Ow! Ow!
257	00:17:11	00:17:13	Ow!
258	00:17:15	00:17:19	There was something odd in the stomach contents.
259	00:17:19	00:17:20	Take a whiff.
260	00:17:22	00:17:24	Alcohol.
261	00:17:24	00:17:25	CuraÃ§ao, maybe.
262	00:17:25	00:17:28	What are these, um, vermiform chunks of meat?
263	00:17:29	00:17:33	Those are Vellikon skullworms, which would of course explain the Tijillian ale.
264	00:17:33	00:17:35	It's Astro Quest food.
265	00:17:35	00:17:40	Some of the bars and restaurants around the convention do that sort of stuff for the conventioneers.
266	00:17:41	00:17:42	That hurt.
267	00:17:43	00:17:44	Good.
268	00:17:45	00:17:47	His name is Jonathan Danson.
269	00:17:47	00:17:48	You recognize him? Yeah.
270	00:17:48	00:17:50	Yeah, he was in here that night.
271	00:17:50	00:17:52	And he wasn't a happy camper.
272	00:17:52	00:17:57	He'd been alone at the bar knocking back drinks when this Astro Quest girl comes up.
273	00:17:57	00:17:59	Yeah, another Vapor, please.
274	00:17:59	00:18:02	He started jocking her pretty hard.
275	00:18:02	00:18:03	No, thank you. No?
276	00:18:03	00:18:05	Could you please let go of me now?
277	00:18:05	00:18:06	Please.
278	00:18:06	00:18:08	Her friends didn't like that.
279	00:18:08	00:18:10	Sir, you just need to let go of my commander.
280	00:18:10	00:18:11	Everything will be okay. Sir, please.
281	00:18:11	00:18:12	Let go! Just let go!
282	00:18:12	00:18:14	Hey, stop that! You have no respect!
283	00:18:16	00:18:18	Get him!
284	00:18:18	00:18:20	First off, we abhor violence.
285	00:18:20	00:18:22	That's the first thing wrong with your entire show!
286	00:18:22	00:18:26	Yeah, now-- see how it feels?
287	00:18:26	00:18:28	I'm not down with violence.
288	00:18:28	00:18:29	So I put an end to it.
289	00:18:30	00:18:35	Any of those people in these photos?
290	00:18:35	00:18:37	Yeah, these three right here.
291	00:18:37	00:18:41	You didn't happen to get any names, did you? No. Sorry.
292	00:18:41	00:18:42	After the fight they all split.
293	00:18:42	00:18:45	Well, there's nothing worse than a bunch of drunk conventioneers.
294	00:18:45	00:18:49	Must be hard enough to sling drinks without making you play dress-up.
295	00:18:54	00:18:56	How do you like this makeup?
296	00:18:56	00:19:00	Got it on my second tour of Afghanistan.
297	00:19:00	00:19:05	These Astro Questors, they believe in a future where human beings, they transcend their differences.
298	00:19:05	00:19:08	I wouldn't mind living in a world like that.
299	00:19:09	00:19:11	Yeah, me either.
300	00:19:12	00:19:14	You better be careful.
301	00:19:14	00:19:16	That thing gave me a nasty little shock.
302	00:19:16	00:19:17	Well, of course it did.
303	00:19:17	00:19:19	This is the...
304	00:19:19	00:19:22	Compliance yoke from The Slavers of Sirenodon.
305	00:19:22	00:19:23	It's a classic.
306	00:19:23	00:19:24	I know, right?
307	00:19:24	00:19:28	So, the commander and his crew are basically forced into hard labor, right? By the planet's...
308	00:19:28	00:19:30	disembodied rulers. Disembodied, yeah.
309	00:19:30	00:19:37	And they make everybody wear one of these things around their necks. Yeah, and if they don't follow orders, then they get zapped with this paralyzing pain.
310	00:19:37	00:19:39	Hey! Hodges!
311	00:19:39	00:19:40	You don't have gloves on.
312	00:19:40	00:19:41	It hasn't been processed.
313	00:19:42	00:19:43	Sorry.
314	00:19:43	00:19:45	Don't make me use this.
315	00:19:49	00:19:53	What, if anything else, did you do growing up?
316	00:19:53	00:19:58	Sneer if you wish, but science fiction has been the inspiration for many great technological breakthroughs.
317	00:19:59	00:20:00	I'm not knocking it. I love sci-fi.
318	00:20:00	00:20:02	You know, especially that talking horse show.
319	00:20:02	00:20:04	That was one of my favorites.
320	00:20:05	00:20:07	Mr. Ed?
321	00:20:07	00:20:08	Yeah. Yeah.
322	00:20:08	00:20:10	That's not science fiction.
323	00:20:10	00:20:11	Sure, it is.
324	00:20:11	00:20:15	It postulates an alternate universe in which horses evolve a larynx. No.
325	00:20:15	00:20:16	See, that's fantasy.
326	00:20:16	00:20:20	No, fantasy is anything that travels faster than the speed of light, Hodges.
327	00:20:20	00:20:24	Which is why if Albert Einstein were alive today, he'd slap your face.
328	00:20:34	00:20:36	I wasn't born to be a slave.
329	00:20:40	00:20:44	Is this what we're supposed to do for the rest of our lives? Yes.
330	00:20:44	00:20:47	The supervisors assign us the tasks we are to perform.
331	00:20:47	00:20:50	Yours is to collect carbonite rocks.
332	00:20:50	00:20:52	Mine is to ensure that you collect carbonite rocks.
333	00:20:53	00:20:55	I'm sick of picking up rocks!
334	00:20:56	00:20:59	Rest if you wish.
335	00:20:59	00:21:01	What I wish...
336	00:21:01	00:21:03	is to be free.
337	00:21:03	00:21:11	On my planet, we choose where we go, what to do, who to love.
338	00:21:11	00:21:13	What is...
339	00:21:13	00:21:14	love?
340	00:21:14	00:21:21	On my planet, love is the single most important thing that can happen between sentient beings.
341	00:21:21	00:21:23	Oh, you mean mating.
342	00:21:23	00:21:28	When the time comes to increase the staff, my supervisor will approve a mate for me.
343	00:21:28	00:21:31	Wouldn't you like to choose your own mate?
344	00:21:31	00:21:34	Wouldn't you like that?
345	00:21:35	00:21:38	Such talk is not permitted in the workplace.
346	00:21:38	00:21:40	Wouldn't you like...
347	00:21:40	00:21:41	just once...
348	00:21:41	00:21:43	to choose for yourself?
349	00:21:47	00:21:49	No! No!
350	00:21:49	00:21:51	Catherine said it would be all right.
351	00:21:51	00:21:53	That Ecklie wouldn't have any problem with it.
352	00:21:53	00:21:54	Hey, Hodges.
353	00:21:54	00:21:55	No!
354	00:21:55	00:21:57	Hodges! Yes?
355	00:21:57	00:22:02	I got work hits off both sets of those prints from that DVD, and they are locals.
356	00:22:02	00:22:05	Well, sort of. They're from Pahrump.
357	00:22:09	00:22:10	How do you do, ma'am?
358	00:22:10	00:22:13	I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.
359	00:22:13	00:22:16	We're looking for Lionel Rose and Steuben Lorenz.
360	00:22:16	00:22:18	They're upstairs.
361	00:22:18	00:22:20	Where else?
362	00:22:30	00:22:31	Identification.
363	00:22:36	00:22:37	Mom, not now.
364	00:22:38	00:22:39	I told you we're debriefing.
365	00:22:42	00:22:43	Red alert.
366	00:22:50	00:22:53	Yeah, we made it. It was a joke.
367	00:22:56	00:22:57	Of course, humor is subjective.
368	00:22:57	00:23:03	So, when Jonathan Danson found you sabotaging his life's work, did he subjectively kick your ass?
369	00:23:04	00:23:05	Hey!
370	00:23:05	00:23:06	Hey!
371	00:23:06	00:23:08	What the hell are you guys doing here?
372	00:23:08	00:23:09	What...
373	00:23:11	00:23:12	(yelps) Don't touch that!
374	00:23:17	00:23:19	No, no, that's not true.
375	00:23:20	00:23:23	He kicked our asses before, at the bar.
376	00:23:25	00:23:38	You see, I adopted a Gandhi-esque strategy of passive resistance to force the aggressor to recognize the immorality of his actions, while Lionel attempted to avoid confrontation like an inferior male baboon who presents his rump for the dominant male to mount.
377	00:23:38	00:23:40	Unfortunately...
378	00:23:40	00:23:43	Danson proved ignorant of baboon body language.
379	00:23:43	00:23:46	We-we didn't even go to the convention hall that night.
380	00:23:46	00:23:48	Risa.
381	00:23:48	00:23:50	Risa Parvess.
382	00:23:50	00:23:52	P-A-R-V-E-S-S.
383	00:23:52	00:23:54	Uh, I didn't think it was a good idea.
384	00:23:54	00:23:57	I mean, she's always been really unstable.
385	00:23:57	00:23:59	Did you deliver the payload?
386	00:24:00	00:24:05	Yeah, I guess, but there were...
387	00:24:05	00:24:07	complications.
388	00:24:07	00:24:09	Complications, like what?
389	00:24:09	00:24:11	Did someone see you?
390	00:24:11	00:24:14	If you did anything to compromise the safety of this crew...
391	00:24:14	00:24:16	There is no crew!
392	00:24:16	00:24:19	This isn't a spaceship!
393	00:24:19	00:24:23	I'm done playing your stupid games.
394	00:24:24	00:24:26	Where do we find her?
395	00:24:26	00:24:28	I have no idea.
396	00:24:28	00:24:30	She's always been quite unstable.
397	00:24:34	00:24:35	Hey. Hey.
398	00:24:35	00:24:42	I just got the results back from the command chair, and it's the victim, plus an unknown female, so we're closing in.
399	00:24:42	00:24:43	Great.
400	00:24:44	00:24:48	Hey, also, I was thinking that maybe after shift, it would be kind of fun to have a little Astro Quest mini-marathon.
401	00:24:48	00:24:49	Ooh.
402	00:24:49	00:24:52	Like maybe Yesterday's Tomorrow, parts 1, 2, and 3?
403	00:24:52	00:24:55	You mean the time travel trilogy from season 4?
404	00:24:55	00:24:57	Oh, yes. It's great.
405	00:24:57	00:24:58	Yeah, count me in.
406	00:24:58	00:24:59	Good. Yeah.
407	00:24:59	00:25:03	Hey, uh, I'll even spring for pizza, if it's not too much of a crowd.
408	00:25:03	00:25:06	Well, two is not much of a crowd, really, so...
409	00:25:06	00:25:08	You mean just you and me?
410	00:25:08	00:25:10	Yeah.
411	00:25:10	00:25:15	You, me, the Blu-Ray DVD box set and a brand-new plasma TV.
412	00:25:16	00:25:17	Over at your place?
413	00:25:17	00:25:18	Yeah.
414	00:25:18	00:25:20	That's where I keep my TV.
415	00:25:20	00:25:22	Okay, sounds good.
416	00:25:22	00:25:24	Yeah, it will be.
417	00:25:43	00:25:45	Have you ever actually seen one?
418	00:25:47	00:25:50	I mean, have you ever actually seen one...
419	00:25:50	00:25:52	in the flesh?
420	00:25:52	00:25:55	A Tijillian concubine.
421	00:25:58	00:26:00	Feral...
422	00:26:00	00:26:01	carnal...
423	00:26:01	00:26:03	voracious.
424	00:26:09	00:26:11	I'd say she's worth a change in shift.
425	00:26:11	00:26:12	Wouldn't you?
426	00:26:24	00:26:26	You're on fire.
427	00:26:30	00:26:31	Hodges, you're on fire.
428	00:26:39	00:26:40	What happened?
429	00:26:40	00:26:45	I was checking the unknown's solubility in acetone, when I guess it caught on fire.
430	00:26:45	00:26:46	My mind wandered.
431	00:26:46	00:26:48	That's been happening a lot lately, Hodges.
432	00:26:48	00:26:49	What's going on with you?
433	00:26:49	00:26:51	There's nothing going on.
434	00:26:51	00:26:55	This is a crime lab, not some Tijillian casbah.
435	00:26:55	00:26:56	Excuse me? You, me, a DVD...
436	00:26:56	00:26:59	I don't think it's going to help us catch a killer.
437	00:26:59	00:27:02	Are you actually trying to blame all this on me?
438	00:27:02	00:27:03	Not in so many words.
439	00:27:03	00:27:04	Okay, you know what?
440	00:27:04	00:27:15	I asked you to come over and watch a DVD-- that's it-- so if you're having some fantasies about me dressed up in a tinfoil bikini, dancing around in a casbah on a strange alien planet, then... good.
441	00:27:15	00:27:17	Good?
442	00:27:17	00:27:21	Yes, good, 'cause it means you're not as oblivious as everyone around here seems to think you are.
443	00:27:21	00:27:24	But the fact is, if you can't handle the way...
444	00:27:24	00:27:31	if you can't handle the way that those fantasies makes you feel, don't turn all that around and blame me when you screw up. Don't worry about it.
445	00:27:31	00:27:35	It's not gonna happen again. Well, that's not the only thing that's not gonna happen. Fine.
446	00:27:35	00:27:37	Fine.
447	00:27:45	00:27:49	Yeah, she, uh, wandered into the bar a couple hours ago.
448	00:27:49	00:27:51	Totally strung out. Okay.
449	00:27:51	00:27:57	Put a little caffeine in her, a little conversation, and she was willing to come in and do the right thing.
450	00:27:57	00:27:58	Okay... thanks.
451	00:27:58	00:27:59	No problem.
452	00:28:00	00:28:01	Hey, you know, um...
453	00:28:01	00:28:03	they were giving these away at the convention.
454	00:28:03	00:28:04	You should check it out.
455	00:28:05	00:28:06	You might like it.
456	00:28:07	00:28:09	Thanks.
457	00:28:16	00:28:18	Miss Parvess?
458	00:28:18	00:28:20	My name is Nick Stokes.
459	00:28:20	00:28:22	I'm with the crime lab.
460	00:28:22	00:28:23	I really appreciate you...
461	00:28:24	00:28:26	coming down here to talk with me.
462	00:28:26	00:28:28	Okay, I'm going to make this real easy for you.
463	00:28:28	00:28:32	I know that Jonathan Danson harassed you in the bar.
464	00:28:32	00:28:38	And I know you were in the booth that night planting your pals' DVD.
465	00:28:38	00:28:44	I also found evidence of sexual activity on the command chair.
466	00:28:44	00:28:46	Now, listen...
467	00:28:46	00:28:51	if he assaulted you in any way and you fought back, that's self-defense.
468	00:28:51	00:28:54	You know that, right?
469	00:28:55	00:28:57	It wasn't self-defense.
470	00:29:01	00:29:03	I liked his show.
471	00:29:03	00:29:08	I think he must have been able to sense that when he saw me at the bar.
472	00:29:11	00:29:13	I used to be just like you.
473	00:29:13	00:29:17	Tormented by impulses I thought were dirty.
474	00:29:17	00:29:21	Desires that have no place in a squeaky-clean universe.
475	00:29:21	00:29:22	Let go of me.
476	00:29:22	00:29:23	Let go of yourself.
477	00:29:24	00:29:32	Stop trying to be something you're not, and the guilt that's eating you alive will fall away.
478	00:29:32	00:29:35	Let me set you free.
479	00:29:43	00:29:45	He took me...
480	00:29:45	00:29:48	to an incredible place.
481	00:29:50	00:29:54	No preconceptions or judgments.
482	00:29:54	00:29:56	Just...
483	00:29:56	00:29:59	pure impulse and...
484	00:29:59	00:30:01	raw instincts.
485	00:30:05	00:30:08	He showed me who I really was.
486	00:30:09	00:30:12	He even gave me his cell phone number.
487	00:30:12	00:30:15	He said he was going to take me to Cabo.
488	00:30:17	00:30:20	Well, I'd say that confirms at least part of her story.
489	00:30:21	00:30:24	Where did you get this?
490	00:30:24	00:30:26	Found it on the vic's laptop.
491	00:30:26	00:30:28	He has quite a collection.
492	00:30:38	00:30:42	And that's Melinda Carver, his producer.
493	00:30:46	00:30:50	It's about seven hours before Risa, just before the VIP premiere of his show.
494	00:30:53	00:30:55	It's good to be the commander.
495	00:31:01	00:31:03	So, what's the point?
496	00:31:03	00:31:06	The point is that you didn't tell me that you were banging the dead guy.
497	00:31:07	00:31:09	That had nothing to do with this.
498	00:31:09	00:31:12	And you didn't tell me you emptied out your 401(k)
499	00:31:12	00:31:13	and gave all the money to Danson.
500	00:31:13	00:31:15	We checked his bank records.
501	00:31:15	00:31:17	He needed it to complete the project.
502	00:31:17	00:31:20	Right. He's been completing a lot of projects lately.
503	00:31:23	00:31:32	And according to the GPS tags on those photographs, he's been working his mojo at most major sci-fi conventions in America.
504	00:31:32	00:31:34	He's a busy guy.
505	00:31:37	00:31:42	I knew about the other women, because Jon told me about them.
506	00:31:42	00:31:46	We had an, uh, an open relationship.
507	00:31:46	00:31:50	Look... Jon was an extremely...
508	00:31:50	00:31:52	complicated human being.
509	00:31:52	00:31:58	(sighs) He was trying to expose the hypocrisy of a sick society.
510	00:31:58	00:32:05	He was a real artist, and that's all that mattered to me, not who he was poking in that chair.
511	00:32:05	00:32:08	That's a nice speech.
512	00:32:09	00:32:12	I'm done talking to you.
513	00:32:15	00:32:16	And that's a nice purse.
514	00:32:21	00:32:23	I'm gonna have to hang on to that.
515	00:32:24	00:32:25	Check it for blood.
516	00:32:25	00:32:28	Be my guest.
517	00:32:28	00:32:33	The weird thing about these photos is the camera angle and the background never change.
518	00:32:33	00:32:38	Which means there must be a hidden camera on the set somewhere?
519	00:32:38	00:32:40	May I? Yeah.
520	00:32:42	00:32:43	Every shot, the victim's hand is on that button.
521	00:32:43	00:32:45	It must be some kind of trigger.
522	00:32:45	00:32:46	Mm-hmm.
523	00:32:46	00:32:48	You didn't notice a camera?
524	00:32:48	00:32:51	No, I didn't, but, I mean, they make them pretty small these days.
525	00:32:51	00:32:53	Some of them even have built-in memory.
526	00:32:53	00:32:57	In other words, if we find it, we may have a photo of our killer.
527	00:33:03	00:33:07	The background in the photo is this point here.
528	00:33:07	00:33:11	The beam needs to line up with the left arm of the chair.
529	00:33:11	00:33:14	Bring it up a bit.
530	00:33:14	00:33:17	A little bit more.
531	00:33:17	00:33:18	Perfect.
532	00:33:22	00:33:26	The camera should be somewhere along this beam.
533	00:33:41	00:33:44	I don't see any camera here.
534	00:33:44	00:33:47	Maybe Danson had a voyeur buddy take the sex pics.
535	00:33:47	00:33:51	Mm. From the same exact angle every time?
536	00:34:19	00:34:20	Wendy?
537	00:34:21	00:34:23	I think I've got it.
538	00:34:23	00:34:24	Got what?
539	00:34:24	00:34:26	The metallic trace from the victim's wound.
540	00:34:26	00:34:28	Give me a second.
541	00:34:28	00:34:30	Does this remind you of anything?
542	00:34:35	00:34:36	Yes.
543	00:34:36	00:34:37	Right? Yes.
544	00:34:43	00:34:44	Langston.
545	00:34:44	00:34:46	It's Hodges and Wendy.
546	00:34:46	00:34:47	What do you got?
547	00:34:48	00:34:50	Yeah, uh, we know what killed Danson.
548	00:34:50	00:34:52	It's in the helm.
549	00:34:52	00:34:55	Okay, I'm going to put you on speaker.
550	00:34:55	00:34:56	Now, it's, it's in the what?
551	00:34:57	00:34:59	I-It's the console that's directly opposite the command chair.
552	00:34:59	00:35:01	There's a retractable viewer inside.
553	00:35:01	00:35:03	It's from the show.
554	00:35:08	00:35:10	Looks like some kind of piston system.
555	00:35:10	00:35:13	Yeah, th-there should be a control for it someplace.
556	00:35:13	00:35:15	It's called a targeting scanner.
557	00:35:17	00:35:19	I think we have it.
558	00:35:21	00:35:24	We also have a digital sex camera.
559	00:35:24	00:35:28	And blood, 90-degree angle.
560	00:35:28	00:35:32	Silver metal paint and a bloody fingerprint.
561	00:35:32	00:35:34	Nice work, people.
562	00:35:34	00:35:37	See you back at the lab.
563	00:35:54	00:35:55	Nice work, Hodges.
564	00:35:55	00:35:57	You, too, Simms.
565	00:36:04	00:36:06	Is she mad at you again?
566	00:36:06	00:36:10	Why don't you two just get it over with?
567	00:36:10	00:36:11	You've been dancing around it for years.
568	00:36:11	00:36:13	Just tell her how you feel.
569	00:36:13	00:36:16	Tell her what, Mr. Andrews?
570	00:36:16	00:36:21	That I'd never be able to give myself to her fully?
571	00:36:23	00:36:28	Because I've made a commitment... to this lab.
572	00:36:28	00:36:32	The pursuit of justice.
573	00:36:32	00:36:35	Do you think it's easy?
574	00:36:35	00:36:43	In the dead of night, I can't help but wonder what it'd be like to savor the pleasures of ordinary men.
575	00:36:43	00:36:46	Moonlit dinners.
576	00:36:46	00:36:50	Murmured endearments.
577	00:36:50	00:36:55	The caress of a woman's soft skin.
578	00:36:55	00:36:57	Long, languid walks on the beach.
579	00:36:57	00:36:59	But you hate the beach.
580	00:37:00	00:37:05	It's understandable, I guess, considering your complexion.
581	00:37:07	00:37:08	What?
582	00:37:08	00:37:16	It's good that you're politically active because if you weren't, you wouldn't have been arrested at that sit-in at Global Media six years ago.
583	00:37:17	00:37:20	Caught in the web of the combine.
584	00:37:20	00:37:21	Hm.
585	00:37:21	00:37:23	That's a reference to One Fl...
586	00:37:23	00:37:24	Yeah, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.
587	00:37:24	00:37:27	I know.
588	00:37:27	00:37:32	And I also know that you didn't mean to kill Jonathan Danson.
589	00:37:32	00:37:34	I know that.
590	00:37:35	00:37:37	It happened.
591	00:37:37	00:37:41	But this is your one chance to get out in front of it, so tell me what happened.
592	00:37:41	00:37:45	Just tell me the truth, and I promise I'll do everything I can to help you.
593	00:37:46	00:37:48	I will.
594	00:37:50	00:37:55	Jonathan Danson took my media semiotics course.
595	00:37:55	00:37:57	He was a good student.
596	00:37:57	00:37:59	Mm-hmm.
597	00:37:59	00:38:03	I heard about his project and thought it would be perfect material for my documentary.
598	00:38:03	00:38:05	Ah.
599	00:38:05	00:38:08	But then I saw Redux.
600	00:38:08	00:38:10	I'm gonna do her! I swear I'm gonna do her!
601	00:38:10	00:38:15	I gave a lecture once, deconstructing Astro Quest as an example.
602	00:38:18	00:38:24	Jonathan had integrated all of my conceits into his fictional construct.
603	00:38:24	00:38:27	He stole your idea.
604	00:38:27	00:38:28	He didn't ask for permission.
605	00:38:28	00:38:32	He... He didn't even acknowledge me in the credits.
606	00:38:32	00:38:34	You want credit?
607	00:38:34	00:38:36	Now, why would I give you that?
608	00:38:36	00:38:38	Because they're my ideas.
609	00:38:38	00:38:42	Whatever happened to Nobody can own an idea?
610	00:38:42	00:38:43	Let me tell you something.
611	00:38:43	00:38:45	Ideas are a dime a dozen.
612	00:38:46	00:38:49	If you want to make them into art, it takes drive, vision, creativity.
613	00:38:49	00:38:51	Hey, I have created...
614	00:38:51	00:38:52	What?
615	00:38:52	00:38:54	Hyperintellectual diarrhea?
616	00:38:56	00:39:02	Go back to writing theory papers for the six other people in your department who read them.
617	00:39:05	00:39:06	I've got a TV show to make.
618	00:39:06	00:39:09	You! You!
619	00:39:13	00:39:14	Let me go!
620	00:39:14	00:39:15	Not till you cool down.
621	00:39:15	00:39:17	Are you gonna be cool?
622	00:39:17	00:39:19	Yes.
623	00:39:20	00:39:23	20 years devoted to media theory.
624	00:39:24	00:39:26	Talk about a wasted life.
625	00:39:36	00:39:39	You see the irony, don't you?
626	00:39:39	00:39:48	Jon attempted to deconstruct Astro Quest's iconography, and he was killed by one of the signifiers he sought to subvert.
627	00:39:50	00:39:53	Derrida, Derrida would have called that...
628	00:39:53	00:39:56	An epistemological dichotomy?
629	00:39:56	00:40:00	I just call it second-degree murder.
630	00:40:08	00:40:10	Anybody up for a little Astro Quest?
631	00:40:10	00:40:11	Oh, no, not tonight.
632	00:40:12	00:40:13	Thanks, though.
633	00:40:13	00:40:15	All right.
634	00:40:16	00:40:18	Break room in five.
635	00:40:18	00:40:19	Let's go.
636	00:40:19	00:40:20	Uh, no, thanks.
637	00:40:20	00:40:23	Enjoy.
638	00:40:23	00:40:25	A Dollop of Apocalypse.
639	00:40:25	00:40:32	Oh, that's the one where they find this planet where, um, amphibians are the dominant species, and they worship Peyton Place as a sacred text.
640	00:40:32	00:40:33	It's classic.
641	00:40:33	00:40:37	W-Wait, the amphibians can read and they choose that?
642	00:40:37	00:40:39	There's a reason for it. You'll see.
643	00:40:52	00:40:59	Jihw-CHOK chom-CHEM jag-eej BRYCE cichoki.
644	00:40:59	00:41:01	I don't speak Vellikon.
645	00:41:01	00:41:02	What'd you say?
646	00:41:18	00:41:22	Anytime you're ready, Ecklie.
647	00:41:22	00:41:27	You will leave me... now?
648	00:41:27	00:41:30	The lab needs me.
649	00:41:30	00:41:34	You have needs of your own, as do I.
650	00:41:38	00:41:42	Maybe, someday, our needs will coincide.
651	00:41:44	00:41:46	I hope so.
652	00:41:46	00:41:47	Till then...
653	00:41:55	00:41:58	Someday.
