0,00:00:12,00:00:14,(engine idling)
1,00:00:23,00:00:25,(car door shuts)
2,00:01:34,00:01:37,(violin playing)
3,00:02:00,00:02:02,Deerstalker cap...
4,00:02:03,00:02:04,violin...
5,00:02:05,00:02:08,...Meerschaum pipe...
6,00:02:08,00:02:14,"even a Persian slipper with tobacco stuffed in the toe, I imagine."
7,00:02:14,00:02:23,"All in all, a meticulous recreation of 221-B Baker Street: residence of the world's greatest detective, Sherlock Holmes."
8,00:02:23,00:02:25,"Also known as Dennis Kingsley, delivery guy."
9,00:02:26,00:02:28,What do you think?
10,00:02:28,00:02:30,Ask Greg. It's his case.
11,00:02:30,00:02:33,"It's his final proficiency-- emphasis on the ""final""."
12,00:02:33,00:02:37,"Okay, Dr. Watson, run it."
13,00:02:37,00:02:43,(sighs): Victim's in a relaxed position in front of a fake fire.
14,00:02:43,00:02:44,Alcohol.
15,00:02:45,00:02:48,Solitude.
16,00:02:49,00:02:51,Powder burns around the entrance wound.
17,00:02:51,00:02:55,Close to contact shot.
18,00:02:55,00:02:57,It all suggests suicide.
19,00:02:57,00:02:59,"Well, if he killed himself, where's the weapon?"
20,00:03:03,00:03:04,(sighs): Huh...
21,00:03:04,00:03:10,Family and friends who discover a body sometimes remove the weapon to make it look like murder.
22,00:03:10,00:03:16,No suicide stigma and better chances of collecting any life insurance.
23,00:03:16,00:03:20,"BRASS: From the look of the place upstairs, this guy lived alone, and the neighbors heard the shot, so..."
24,00:03:20,00:03:23,"Pretty good. I guess I'll, uh, go interview the neighbors."
25,00:03:25,00:03:28,"So, are you going to say the game's afoot?"
26,00:03:29,00:03:32,"I didn't know you were a Conan Doyle fan, Greg."
27,00:03:32,00:03:36,I'm not. I saw a Sherlock Holmes movie once by mistake.
28,00:03:36,00:03:38,"Well, just so you know..."
29,00:03:38,00:03:40,those movies never ended like this.
30,00:04:17,00:04:18,"(chuckles): Yeah, boy, okay."
31,00:04:21,00:04:22,GRISSOM: Anything useful?
32,00:04:22,00:04:27,"Well, I found out if I ever need a home loan, as a public servant, I'm pre-approved."
33,00:04:27,00:04:30,"You know, the guy looks like a, uh, drug dealer."
34,00:04:30,00:04:32,Turns out he's a mortgage broker.
35,00:04:32,00:04:34,"Well, we all have our costumes, Jim."
36,00:04:35,00:04:36,Yeah.
37,00:04:38,00:04:42,"Yeah, apparently some more than others."
38,00:04:42,00:04:46,I assume you're friends of Mr. Kingsley?
39,00:04:46,00:04:48,We are friends of Mr. Holmes.
40,00:04:48,00:04:50,"Invited guests, in point of fact."
41,00:04:50,00:04:53,This is all so contemporary.
42,00:04:54,00:04:56,"Well, I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab."
43,00:04:56,00:04:59,"Ah, a colleague. Perhaps we can be of some assistance."
44,00:04:59,00:05:02,Yes. Have you discovered any shoe impressions in the soil?
45,00:05:02,00:05:03,Not yet.
46,00:05:03,00:05:05,This is a crime scene.
47,00:05:06,00:05:09,"Oh, a scenario created for our own entertainment, yes?"
48,00:05:19,00:05:21,I guess it depends on what you find entertaining.
49,00:05:30,00:05:31,Anyone for pizza?
50,00:05:31,00:05:34,Very funny.
51,00:05:36,00:05:37,Got it.
52,00:05:38,00:05:42,Ooh. BFB.
53,00:05:42,00:05:44,Big freakin' bullet.
54,00:05:44,00:05:45,Nose is mushroomed.
55,00:05:46,00:05:47,Looks like pure lead.
56,00:05:47,00:05:52,Two cannelures consistent with a revolver.
57,00:05:52,00:05:59,"One, two, three, four, five, six lands and grooves."
58,00:05:59,00:06:00,Left hand twist.
59,00:06:00,00:06:02,Which usually means...?
60,00:06:02,00:06:04,Colt .45?
61,00:06:06,00:06:08,Are you checking up on me?
62,00:06:08,00:06:09,"No, no, no, no."
63,00:06:09,00:06:14,"Grissom said he was just evaluating you on processing this one room, so..."
64,00:06:14,00:06:17,I figured maybe you could use some help with the rest of the house.
65,00:06:17,00:06:19,Thanks.
66,00:06:34,00:06:37,Guess everyone needs a hobby.
67,00:06:37,00:06:41,We would study the Holmes text in cases and important 19th century events.
68,00:06:41,00:06:43,We met every Thursday night.
69,00:06:43,00:06:44,You make it sound like a bowling league.
70,00:06:44,00:06:48,This is a serious literary association.
71,00:06:48,00:06:51,"As usual, Dr. Watson, subtlety is lost upon you."
72,00:06:51,00:06:58,You see a stab wound above her breast and overlook the absence of blood on the chair as well as the fact that her skirt is raised.
73,00:06:58,00:07:03,"This body was posed, and quite beautifully, I might add."
74,00:07:03,00:07:09,"Moriarty, if evil for evil's sake were a pathological condition, it would be your diagnosis."
75,00:07:09,00:07:12,"Gentlemen, your disdain for one another distracts you from the truth."
76,00:07:12,00:07:15,The wedding picture on the wall?
77,00:07:15,00:07:17,The victims were husband and wife.
78,00:07:17,00:07:20,"As usual, Miss Adler, your deduction is correct."
79,00:07:21,00:07:23,It was indeed a crime of passion.
80,00:07:23,00:07:26,Sounds fun-- when was the last time you saw Dennis Kingsley?
81,00:07:26,00:07:28,Last Thursday.
82,00:07:28,00:07:31,He said that he was going to make this meeting really special.
83,00:07:31,00:07:39,"It seems our time here tonight has ended, and that, I fear, is the gist of the announcement I must share with you now."
84,00:07:39,00:07:51,"Next week will be the final meeting of our society, but I give you my word: it shall be an evening none of you will ever forget."
85,00:07:51,00:07:54,I didn't think that he meant this.
86,00:07:54,00:07:57,We're going to need names and contact information.
87,00:07:57,00:08:00,It would also be helpful if you'd let us take your fingerprints.
88,00:08:00,00:08:01,Why?
89,00:08:01,00:08:04,Elementary. So we can rule you out.
90,00:08:04,00:08:08,You've all obviously been in the study on numerous occasions.
91,00:08:08,00:08:10,We need to find out if the prints we find are relevant.
92,00:08:10,00:08:13,So you actually think this is something other than suicide?
93,00:08:13,00:08:15,"You know, I think you ought to drop the accent."
94,00:08:15,00:08:17,I can't. I'm English.
95,00:08:17,00:08:19,Oh.
96,00:09:13,00:09:15,There's possible signs of forced entry at the back door.
97,00:09:15,00:09:17,It could be recent.
98,00:09:17,00:09:20,"Also, I think the vic had a family at some point."
99,00:09:20,00:09:21,Brass is on it.
100,00:09:24,00:09:26,Check this out.
101,00:09:26,00:09:29,SIDLE: The Hound of the Baskervilles.
102,00:09:29,00:09:30,I read that in 10th grade.
103,00:09:30,00:09:32,"Oh, yeah-- I was supposed to."
104,00:09:32,00:09:34,There's a blood stain on the page ends.
105,00:09:34,00:09:37,Huh.
106,00:09:37,00:09:40,The spatter goes across and over.
107,00:09:40,00:09:42,That stain did not come from this event.
108,00:09:44,00:09:48,"It could be the vic's, or it could be stage blood, for that matter."
109,00:09:48,00:09:54,Do you think an obsessive neat freak like our vic would leave something like that on one of his most prized possessions?
110,00:09:54,00:09:57,I think... there's only one way to find out.
111,00:10:18,00:10:20,"Hey, Chris."
112,00:10:20,00:10:23,"Nevada power guys-- they saw the Jeep, called it in."
113,00:10:23,00:10:24,I ran the plates.
114,00:10:24,00:10:26,"R.O. is, uh, Cory Demayo, 25."
115,00:10:26,00:10:28,Lives on Florentine.
116,00:10:28,00:10:29,Spoke to the roommate.
117,00:10:29,00:10:31,Driver fits the description.
118,00:10:31,00:10:32,Vic's got a contusion on his forehead.
119,00:10:32,00:10:34,Probably from the impact.
120,00:10:34,00:10:35,"STOKES: Yeah, I can see that."
121,00:10:35,00:10:37,It's just hard to believe that's what killed him.
122,00:10:37,00:10:40,I didn't see any skid marks on the road up there.
123,00:10:40,00:10:42,There's no signs he tried to brake.
124,00:10:42,00:10:44,"Well, maybe he fell asleep at the wheel."
125,00:10:44,00:10:45,"Uh, coming over that embankment?"
126,00:10:45,00:10:47,That would've woke him up.
127,00:10:47,00:10:48,Key's still in the ignition.
128,00:10:48,00:10:50,Car's in drive.
129,00:10:50,00:10:51,Engine's not running.
130,00:10:51,00:10:54,Did the paramedics open this door?
131,00:10:54,00:10:56,Vitals were taken through the open window.
132,00:10:56,00:10:59,Door was ajar when we arrived on the scene.
133,00:11:03,00:11:06,"Hey, Nick, check this out."
134,00:11:06,00:11:08,Oh. Guy was getting high.
135,00:11:09,00:11:11,Think that's the reason he missed the curve up there?
136,00:11:12,00:11:12,You think?
137,00:11:18,00:11:20,Ah. We got a wallet.
138,00:11:20,00:11:21,"Yeah, yeah."
139,00:11:24,00:11:26,Cory Demayo.
140,00:11:26,00:11:27,Fits the description.
141,00:11:28,00:11:29,"No cash, no plastic."
142,00:11:29,00:11:32,This is a pretty remote place for an accident.
143,00:11:32,00:11:35,"But you think someone saw it, took advantage of the situation?"
144,00:11:35,00:11:37,Maybe he wasn't alone.
145,00:11:37,00:11:42,"Maybe the passenger survived, then emptied out his wallet, took off."
146,00:11:42,00:11:44,Maybe.
147,00:12:30,00:12:33,This guy really dress up like Sherlock Holmes?
148,00:12:33,00:12:37,"At least once a week, evidently, like those Civil War re-enactors."
149,00:12:37,00:12:39,"I, uh, never understood that."
150,00:12:39,00:12:42,"Yeah. In any event, C.O.D. was no surprise."
151,00:12:42,00:12:45,"Perforating contact range, gunshot to the right temple."
152,00:12:45,00:12:47,SANDERS: Got the tox.
153,00:12:47,00:12:49,Cocaine metabolites in the vic's urine.
154,00:12:49,00:12:51,500 nanograms per M.O.
155,00:12:51,00:12:53,You only see levels that high in chronic users.
156,00:12:53,00:12:55,Those are the track marks.
157,00:12:55,00:12:59,"SANDERS: Yeah, but there was also morphine in his blood and in the syringe."
158,00:13:00,00:13:03,"Seven percent solution, morphine sulfate and water."
159,00:13:03,00:13:06,Sherlock went from crack to smack.
160,00:13:06,00:13:09,Morphine metabolites in his system but no heroin metabolites?
161,00:13:09,00:13:10,He wasn't on street junk.
162,00:13:10,00:13:12,This is pharmaceutical- grade stuff.
163,00:13:12,00:13:14,"And at a pretty hefty dose, too."
164,00:13:14,00:13:16,How fast for the injection to take effect?
165,00:13:16,00:13:20,"Given his size, he would've been incapacitated in a matter of seconds."
166,00:13:20,00:13:27,"Not much time to undo the works, put away his antique syringe, pick up a gun and blow his brains out."
167,00:13:27,00:13:28,Wait a minute.
168,00:13:29,00:13:32,The GSR test on his hand was positive.
169,00:13:32,00:13:33,What are you getting at?
170,00:13:38,00:13:39,"Well, maybe Sherlock had some help."
171,00:13:45,00:13:47,"BRASS: Hey, when was the last time you saw Cory?"
172,00:13:47,00:13:51,"Yesterday. Just kicking it, like me."
173,00:13:51,00:13:54,"How'd you get that bruise on your dome, man?"
174,00:13:54,00:13:56,"Oh, uh, windsurfing."
175,00:13:56,00:13:59,"Hey, you guys go out there together?"
176,00:13:59,00:14:01,"Yeah. Well, he's got the wheels, so..."
177,00:14:01,00:14:03,So you drove back together?
178,00:14:03,00:14:05,No.
179,00:14:05,00:14:07,"I sort of hooked up with this chick, so I bounced."
180,00:14:07,00:14:09,Nice. You know the chick's name?
181,00:14:09,00:14:11,"Uh, Jennifer."
182,00:14:11,00:14:12,Jennifer who?
183,00:14:12,00:14:16,"Jennifer, uh... nipple ring."
184,00:14:16,00:14:18,(chuckling): Jennifer Nipple Ring.
185,00:14:20,00:14:23,"Lawery, were you guys, uh, getting high yesterday?"
186,00:14:23,00:14:24,You smoke some weed?
187,00:14:24,00:14:26,Nope.
188,00:14:26,00:14:27,No?
189,00:14:27,00:14:30,"All right, let me tell you what I think happened."
190,00:14:30,00:14:34,"You and Cory got stoned, and you drove away."
191,00:14:34,00:14:36,Cory lost control of the Jeep...
192,00:14:39,00:14:45,"...at which point, you couldn't wake him up, so you decided to take advantage of the situation, and you rifle through his wallet and leave."
193,00:14:45,00:14:47,"Man, that is not what went down."
194,00:14:47,00:14:52,"You're looking at robbery, leaving the scene, failure to report an accident."
195,00:14:52,00:14:53,"That's a lot of years, man."
196,00:14:53,00:14:57,"I didn't get back in the car with Cory, and if I had, I wouldn't have left him!"
197,00:14:57,00:15:00,"Lawery, we're going to need a DNA sample from you."
198,00:15:00,00:15:02,What? Why?
199,00:15:02,00:15:06,"Just to prove that, uh, your lips weren't on that joint that we found in the Jeep."
200,00:15:08,00:15:09,"All right, man."
201,00:15:09,00:15:12,Let me just be straight with you guys for a second here.
202,00:15:12,00:15:16,"I admit, Cory and I sparked up at the lake, okay?"
203,00:15:17,00:15:19,But then he took off.
204,00:15:20,00:15:23,"Three weeks ago, I was busted for pot, okay?"
205,00:15:23,00:15:25,The judge gave me diversion.
206,00:15:25,00:15:30,"You guys file charges, I'm screwed."
207,00:15:30,00:15:32,I will never get into dental school.
208,00:15:36,00:15:38,The fragment you found at the scene?
209,00:15:38,00:15:39,It's a mother of pearl.
210,00:15:39,00:15:42,It could be from an ornament or a piece of jewelry.
211,00:15:42,00:15:43,It could be from a lot of things.
212,00:15:43,00:15:45,"Yeah, that it could, Mr. Proficiency."
213,00:15:46,00:15:48,I also I.D.'d the ash on the floor.
214,00:15:48,00:15:53,"Perique tobacco, grown in only one spot on Earth: St. James Parish, Louisiana."
215,00:15:53,00:15:56,The same as the umber of tobacco in the victim's slipper?
216,00:15:56,00:15:57,"No, completely different make."
217,00:15:57,00:15:59,"Cheap, strong, low-grade stuff."
218,00:15:59,00:16:00,Shag tobacco.
219,00:16:01,00:16:03,Yeah. How'd you know?
220,00:16:03,00:16:04,That's what Holmes smoked.
221,00:16:05,00:16:08,"Bad habit, even for a fictional character."
222,00:16:10,00:16:13,You do have two suspects with pipes.
223,00:16:13,00:16:17,"Yeah... and, uh, smoking kills."
224,00:16:29,00:16:31,"MAN: We got to stop meeting like this, baby."
225,00:16:31,00:16:33,How was your game?
226,00:16:33,00:16:35,"I'm swinging a hot stick tonight, babe."
227,00:16:37,00:16:39,Can I get you something?
228,00:16:39,00:16:41,"No, I'm just looking for someone."
229,00:16:44,00:16:46,You're staring at me.
230,00:16:47,00:16:48,Oh.
231,00:16:48,00:16:51,Uh... I'm sorry.
232,00:16:51,00:16:53,I didn't recognize you from last night.
233,00:16:55,00:16:56,Is that a friend of yours?
234,00:16:56,00:16:58,(laughs): Give me a break.
235,00:16:58,00:17:00,Did that guy look like a friend of mine?
236,00:17:00,00:17:04,"Every time he touches me, I want to kick him in the scrotum, but he's a big tipper."
237,00:17:04,00:17:06,I've got a sick mother and rent to pay.
238,00:17:06,00:17:08,"Well, I just have a couple of questions."
239,00:17:08,00:17:10,"At Denny Kingsley's, you were smoking a pipe."
240,00:17:12,00:17:14,Yeah... a Meerschaum.
241,00:17:14,00:17:16,I'm going to need it.
242,00:17:16,00:17:17,Why?
243,00:17:17,00:17:20,"Let me worry about that, okay?"
244,00:17:22,00:17:24,"Uh, J.J., can you hand me my purse, please?"
245,00:17:24,00:17:25,Okay.
246,00:17:36,00:17:38,Dr. Watson?
247,00:17:38,00:17:40,I'm Sara Sidle with the Crime Lab.
248,00:17:40,00:17:41,Hello.
249,00:17:41,00:17:42,Do you have a minute?
250,00:17:43,00:17:49,I'm here to collect your Meerschaum pipe as well as any other tobacco products you might have in your possession.
251,00:17:49,00:17:52,I don't smoke anything illegal.
252,00:17:52,00:17:53,You haven't been accused of that.
253,00:17:53,00:17:56,"Anyway, my pipe is at home."
254,00:17:56,00:17:58,No problem. Let's go.
255,00:17:58,00:18:00,"Look, I'm working."
256,00:18:00,00:18:03,"We've already talked to your boss, and I have a warrant."
257,00:18:03,00:18:04,Let me get that for you.
258,00:18:10,00:18:14,Were you wearing those shoes at your last club meeting?
259,00:18:14,00:18:19,"Yeah. They're not technically right for the period, but black leather shoes are black leather shoes."
260,00:18:19,00:18:22,I'm not the same stickler for detail that Denny was.
261,00:18:22,00:18:24,Apparently not.
262,00:18:24,00:18:26,Vic was physically fit.
263,00:18:26,00:18:30,"Scratches and abrasions are antemortem, unrelated to the accident."
264,00:18:30,00:18:33,"The contusion on the forehead was, uh, superficial, right?"
265,00:18:33,00:18:34,You are right.
266,00:18:34,00:18:36,"Okay, so what's the cause of death, Doc?"
267,00:18:37,00:18:38,Undetermined.
268,00:18:39,00:18:41,"But you're still working on it, right?"
269,00:18:41,00:18:43,"Unless some other evidence comes to light, I'm done."
270,00:18:43,00:18:45,Sometimes I can't tell you why they die.
271,00:18:53,00:18:54,What you got?
272,00:18:54,00:18:56,Passenger door latch is busted.
273,00:18:56,00:18:58,It could've happened during the accident.
274,00:18:58,00:19:00,"Well, that is consistent with the roommate's story."
275,00:19:00,00:19:03,Says he wasn't in the passenger seat during the time of the crash.
276,00:19:03,00:19:05,What'd you get back from Tox?
277,00:19:05,00:19:08,Tox came back positive for low levels of cannabis.
278,00:19:08,00:19:16,"I know marijuana slows your reaction time, but based on the lack of skid marks at the scene, the position of the vehicle, I don't think this guy ever hit the brakes."
279,00:19:16,00:19:17,"Well, maybe he did hit the brakes."
280,00:19:17,00:19:18,Did you check 'em?
281,00:19:18,00:19:20,"Come on, you're a bigger boy than me."
282,00:19:20,00:19:23,"Yeah, you can't do anything yourself, can you?"
283,00:19:27,00:19:29,You ready?
284,00:19:29,00:19:31,"Yeah, yeah, put your back into it."
285,00:19:31,00:19:33,(grunts)
286,00:19:35,00:19:37,Brakes work.
287,00:19:37,00:19:41,"Brake lights are working, so that means the battery's okay."
288,00:19:41,00:19:42,"Yeah, but the gauges are all off."
289,00:19:42,00:19:44,The panel's not even working.
290,00:19:44,00:19:50,"Okay, ignition was on, but the engine wasn't running, so... what?"
291,00:19:50,00:19:51,No gas?
292,00:19:53,00:19:56,"(grunts): That tank is full of fuel, man."
293,00:19:56,00:19:58,Cory was in good shape.
294,00:19:58,00:20:02,"The Jeep seems to be in decent condition, so..."
295,00:20:02,00:20:04,(sighs): what happened out there?
296,00:20:04,00:20:06,Swing shift's short a couple of bodies.
297,00:20:06,00:20:08,"Yes, and when is that going to change?"
298,00:20:08,00:20:10,"Not anytime soon-- Catherine, there are budget constraints."
299,00:20:11,00:20:12,You'll have to prioritize.
300,00:20:12,00:20:14,Should we come back?
301,00:20:14,00:20:15,"No, no, no, come on in."
302,00:20:15,00:20:18,"So, how's your, uh, your surfer dude case?"
303,00:20:18,00:20:23,"Uh, the victim's roommate admits they got high together, but denies being in the Jeep at the time of the accident."
304,00:20:23,00:20:25,"At this point, we can't place him there."
305,00:20:25,00:20:27,Brakes on the Jeep were functioning.
306,00:20:27,00:20:29,The driver should've been able to stop.
307,00:20:29,00:20:30,Any signs of foul play?
308,00:20:30,00:20:31,STOKES: No.
309,00:20:31,00:20:33,Something's not right.
310,00:20:33,00:20:35,"ECKLEY: All right, nothing suspicious and no crime's committed?"
311,00:20:35,00:20:36,Put the case to bed.
312,00:20:36,00:20:39,I'm sure your supervisor can keep you busy.
313,00:20:39,00:20:41,Close it.
314,00:20:42,00:20:45,Sounds like he's more concerned with getting it done than getting it right.
315,00:20:45,00:20:46,Are you guys satisfied?
316,00:20:47,00:20:49,We don't have an answer.
317,00:20:49,00:20:51,Then get one.
318,00:20:51,00:20:52,What about Eckley?
319,00:20:53,00:20:56,"(sighs): My problem, not yours."
320,00:22:07,00:22:08,(sighs)
321,00:22:08,00:22:10,You nervous?
322,00:22:10,00:22:12,A little.
323,00:22:12,00:22:13,Relax.
324,00:22:13,00:22:14,Relax.
325,00:22:14,00:22:18,"Just two law enforcement professionals talking to one another, that's all."
326,00:22:18,00:22:21,I'm a security guard. Don't patronize me.
327,00:22:21,00:22:24,"I bet you always wanted to be a cop, am I right?"
328,00:22:24,00:22:26,So what happened?
329,00:22:26,00:22:28,Flunk the physical?
330,00:22:28,00:22:29,Huh?
331,00:22:29,00:22:31,That's okay; lot of guys do.
332,00:22:31,00:22:33,No?
333,00:22:33,00:22:35,"What was it then, psych?"
334,00:22:35,00:22:37,I was on medication.
335,00:22:37,00:22:40,You can't be a cop if you're on this medication.
336,00:22:40,00:22:42,But you can be Sherlock Holmes.
337,00:22:42,00:22:44,I was Dr. Watson...
338,00:22:44,00:22:46,in our club.
339,00:22:47,00:22:48,Denny was Sherlock Holmes.
340,00:22:48,00:22:53,"""There can only be one."" So, when Denny wasn't there, you could be Sherlock."
341,00:22:53,00:22:55,I suppose.
342,00:22:55,00:22:57,That why you killed him?
343,00:22:57,00:22:58,I didn't kill him.
344,00:22:58,00:23:04,"Denny was a friend, and if I wanted to be Sherlock, all I had to do was wait."
345,00:23:04,00:23:05,Denny was quitting.
346,00:23:06,00:23:07,We talked about it a lot.
347,00:23:07,00:23:09,He said he was going back to his wife.
348,00:23:09,00:23:14,"So you went to his house, you shot him, and then you left, and you came back later with your pals and acted like nothing happened."
349,00:23:14,00:23:16,I went straight home after work.
350,00:23:16,00:23:22,"His blood on your shoe, tobacco ash from your pipe on the carpet next to his body-- that puts you where he was killed."
351,00:23:23,00:23:24,No way.
352,00:23:24,00:23:26,"Look, there are two kinds of stories: fact and fiction."
353,00:23:26,00:23:27,I know that.
354,00:23:27,00:23:29,Sherlock Holmes: fiction.
355,00:23:29,00:23:32,Dennis Kingsley's murder: fact.
356,00:23:32,00:23:33,Your story: fiction.
357,00:23:33,00:23:37,"No, I swear. God help me, I'm telling the truth."
358,00:23:37,00:23:41,I-I wasn't there. I didn't kill Denny.
359,00:23:41,00:23:45,DNA confirms that the blood on Watson's shoe is a match to your vic.
360,00:23:45,00:23:47,We got him.
361,00:23:47,00:23:49,Feel like celebrating after shift?
362,00:23:50,00:23:52,I'm buying.
363,00:23:52,00:23:53,These blood drops aren't uniform.
364,00:23:53,00:23:57,"Some of them are clotted red cells, but others are pure serum."
365,00:24:00,00:24:03,It takes at least 20 minutes for blood to clot and separate.
366,00:24:03,00:24:06,"If Watson killed Sherlock, the blood drops on his shoe would all be the same."
367,00:24:06,00:24:09,The killer takes some of the victim's blood at the scene...
368,00:24:11,00:24:16,...the red blood cells in the serum separate and get sprayed on the shoe later.
369,00:24:17,00:24:19,Somebody's trying to frame Watson.
370,00:24:22,00:24:24,"SANDERS: Jeez,allhis stuff is up for auction."
371,00:24:25,00:24:26,This is Dennis Kingsley's entire collection.
372,00:24:26,00:24:28,He's getting rid of everything.
373,00:24:28,00:24:29,Might have needed the cash?
374,00:24:30,00:24:31,I don't know.
375,00:24:31,00:24:33,Maybe he was just trying to get back to reality.
376,00:24:33,00:24:35,Hold it.
377,00:24:35,00:24:38,"Murder weapon was a Colt .45 revolver, current whereabouts unknown."
378,00:24:38,00:24:41,"Huh, I thought you were looking for a book."
379,00:24:41,00:24:43,We are. We ran DNA on this blood stain.
380,00:24:43,00:24:46,"It's not the victim's, and there's no hits through CODIS."
381,00:24:47,00:24:49,You think it's the killer's? Maybe.
382,00:24:49,00:24:50,"Come on, let's keep going."
383,00:24:50,00:24:53,There it is-- The Hound of the Baskervilles.
384,00:24:53,00:24:55,(beep)
385,00:24:55,00:24:58,"When he photographed it, there was no blood on the pages."
386,00:24:58,00:25:00,Can you pull up the bidding history?
387,00:25:00,00:25:01,"Yes, I can."
388,00:25:01,00:25:04,Let's see who's interested.
389,00:25:04,00:25:05,JOHNSON: Huh.
390,00:25:05,00:25:06,Reichenbach.
391,00:25:06,00:25:08,What's the big deal about that?
392,00:25:08,00:25:09,Reichenbach Falls?
393,00:25:13,00:25:16,It's where Professor Moriarty killed Sherlock Holmes.
394,00:25:16,00:25:18,(beeping)
395,00:25:18,00:25:21,MAN: The 1902 first British Edition ofThe Hound?
396,00:25:21,00:25:22,Of course I wanted it.
397,00:25:22,00:25:24,I'm a doctoral candidate in English history.
398,00:25:24,00:25:30,I helped Denny create that astonishing verisimilitude of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Britain. Order!
399,00:25:30,00:25:32,(bell dings)
400,00:25:32,00:25:35,SIDLE: He was selling the collection off in pieces.
401,00:25:35,00:25:36,It must have pissed you off.
402,00:25:36,00:25:38,He was a self-destructive narcissist.
403,00:25:38,00:25:41,"If he had to give it up, we all had to give it up."
404,00:25:41,00:25:43,And you weren't willing to do that?
405,00:25:43,00:25:47,"As you can see, the modest stipend I get from my graduate studies doesn't go far."
406,00:25:47,00:25:51,What I offered forThe Hound is every penny I had. Order!
407,00:25:51,00:25:54,"SANDERS: But then he put it up for auction, and made you bid for it."
408,00:25:54,00:25:58,"When the price got too high, you confronted him."
409,00:25:58,00:25:59,(laughs)
410,00:25:59,00:26:01,"That is empty speculation, my friend."
411,00:26:01,00:26:04,"Hold out your hands for me, please?"
412,00:26:04,00:26:05,My hands?
413,00:26:05,00:26:06,Yeah.
414,00:26:06,00:26:07,Your hands.
415,00:26:09,00:26:10,Fine.
416,00:26:12,00:26:15,"SANDERS: Ooh, that looks like a paper cut to me."
417,00:26:15,00:26:17,Are we gonna find your blood on that book?
418,00:26:18,00:26:19,If you can't pay me what it's worth...
419,00:26:19,00:26:21,"Oh, come on, you owe me as much."
420,00:26:21,00:26:22,Come on. Come...
421,00:26:22,00:26:24,Give it! Ow!
422,00:26:24,00:26:25,"Bloody hell, Dennis."
423,00:26:27,00:26:30,"Fine, fine, fine."
424,00:26:30,00:26:34,"Yes, I stopped by Dennis's house earlier that evening to make my case, but I didn't kill him."
425,00:26:34,00:26:37,"If I had, believe me, I would have taken that book."
426,00:26:39,00:26:41,Tow truck will be here in about an hour.
427,00:26:41,00:26:42,"All right, we're on the clock."
428,00:26:42,00:26:44,Let's take this thing apart.
429,00:27:36,00:27:41,"Hey, I've got some blown fuses and some fried wiring up here."
430,00:27:41,00:27:42,Yeah?
431,00:27:42,00:27:43,Yeah.
432,00:27:43,00:27:45,I've got some burn marks on the undercarriage.
433,00:27:45,00:27:48,"And I found something similar on the roll bar, as well."
434,00:27:48,00:27:50,"Well, that would indicate some sort of electrical shock."
435,00:27:50,00:27:56,"Well, if an electrical charge traveled through the Jeep, and shorted out the wiring, it would have shocked Cory, as well."
436,00:27:57,00:27:57,"Like what, lightning?"
437,00:27:58,00:28:01,"Yeah, but it was clear yesterday."
438,00:28:01,00:28:04,"Whatever it was, it zapped the hell out of his Jeep."
439,00:28:04,00:28:06,Let's go back out there and check it out.
440,00:28:11,00:28:15,"Cory was coming from Lake Mead, which is that way."
441,00:28:15,00:28:16,Let's walk.
442,00:28:16,00:28:18,Yeah.
443,00:28:18,00:28:20,(birds singing)
444,00:28:38,00:28:40,Wire trimmings.
445,00:28:40,00:28:42,They look fresh.
446,00:28:42,00:28:44,(camera shutter clicking)
447,00:28:52,00:28:55,Looks like a new splice on those wires.
448,00:28:55,00:28:58,"Well, the power company originally called that Jeep in."
449,00:28:58,00:29:00,They must have been out here fixing the lines.
450,00:29:00,00:29:01,Maybe it was a down line.
451,00:29:02,00:29:05,That would give us the high voltage power source right there.
452,00:29:05,00:29:11,"Yeah, but even if a live wire struck the roll bar, the tires would have insulated the vehicle."
453,00:29:11,00:29:14,"Right. Without a path to ground, electricity is harmless."
454,00:29:16,00:29:18,What about that road marker?
455,00:29:31,00:29:35,It's bent in the direction Cory was driving.
456,00:29:35,00:29:36,Black transfer.
457,00:29:36,00:29:38,Wasn't the undercarriage of Cory's Jeep black?
458,00:29:39,00:29:41,"(tires screeching, squeaking)"
459,00:29:42,00:29:44,This marker would have grounded the Jeep.
460,00:29:44,00:29:50,"Completing the circuit, and theoretically, electrocuting the vehicle."
461,00:30:20,00:30:22,I want to go back to the crime scene.
462,00:30:24,00:30:32,"The grips of Dennis Kingsley's antique Colt .45 were mother of pearl, consistent with the chip collected here."
463,00:30:32,00:30:38,"I identified trace on the edge of that chip, and it's red clay dust."
464,00:30:38,00:30:40,(sighs)
465,00:30:40,00:30:44,"The fire's fake, but these red clay bricks are real."
466,00:30:45,00:30:47,"So, what are you looking for?"
467,00:30:47,00:30:49,"Well, the killer obviously left with the gun."
468,00:30:49,00:30:57,"And if there was some kind of struggle, maybe the killer left behind some skin fragments or a strand of hair."
469,00:30:59,00:31:01,(groaning)
470,00:31:01,00:31:05,Was there any evidence of a struggle in this room?
471,00:31:05,00:31:07,Not really.
472,00:31:15,00:31:17,"Well, so much for the obvious."
473,00:31:27,00:31:29,SIDLE: He committed suicide?
474,00:31:29,00:31:30,The man was a credit to his genre.
475,00:31:30,00:31:34,He runs a loop of surgical tubing through the weapon secured inside the chimney.
476,00:31:34,00:31:37,A shot of morphine a few minutes earlier takes the edge off.
477,00:31:37,00:31:41,And it provides extra insurance in case the gun doesn't finish the job.
478,00:31:41,00:31:43,(gunshot)
479,00:31:43,00:31:48,It would have been easy for him to plant Watson's brand of tobacco ash on his floor.
480,00:31:48,00:31:54,"I figure, Sherlock drew his own blood in advance and then sprayed it on Watson's shoe at their last meeting."
481,00:31:54,00:31:56,The world's greatest detective makes suicide look like murder?
482,00:31:58,00:32:02,Why would he try and frame his best friend in the process?
483,00:32:02,00:32:05,"Well, Watson said they were friends, but who knows what kind of relationship they really had."
484,00:32:06,00:32:07,Maybe they hated each other.
485,00:32:07,00:32:10,Maybe Dennis couldn't stand the thought of anyone else being Sherlock.
486,00:32:10,00:32:12,"Besides, I thought motive wasn't our business."
487,00:32:12,00:32:15,It's not.
488,00:32:16,00:32:20,"Write it up, give the report to Grissom."
489,00:32:21,00:32:22,Way to go.
490,00:32:22,00:32:24,All right.
491,00:33:41,00:33:42,What...
492,00:33:42,00:33:44,What is going on?
493,00:33:44,00:33:46,We're finishing up the case.
494,00:33:46,00:33:48,(scoffs)
495,00:33:48,00:33:50,Do you know how much Ballistic Joe costs?
496,00:33:50,00:33:52,I didn't know you did.
497,00:33:52,00:33:56,"I just thought you guys were gonna go over your notes, look over the case file."
498,00:33:56,00:33:57,"Well, hold on now."
499,00:33:57,00:34:01,We found electrical burn marks on the roll bar and the Jeep's undercarriage.
500,00:34:01,00:34:05,And we found blown out fuses on the instrument panel and the starter.
501,00:34:05,00:34:07,That would explain why the Jeep wasn't running.
502,00:34:07,00:34:11,"Yeah, we called Nevada power, and they confirmed there was a downed power line the day of the accident."
503,00:34:11,00:34:13,"So, you're saying the victim was electrocuted?"
504,00:34:13,00:34:15,Yeah.
505,00:34:15,00:34:20,"BROWN: So we replaced the fuses, we connected the Jeep to a power source, and we hooked up Gelatin Man here to a hand meter."
506,00:34:22,00:34:26,"Watch it wiggle, see it jiggle, I get it."
507,00:34:28,00:34:31,"Well, you're gonna need at least six milliamps to prove your theory."
508,00:34:33,00:34:36,I'm on it.
509,00:34:36,00:34:38,(engine starting)
510,00:34:45,00:34:47,(engine revving)
511,00:34:48,00:34:50,(electrical sparking)
512,00:34:50,00:34:52,WILLOWS: Congratulations.
513,00:34:52,00:34:54,"You killed the Jeep, but the victim's still alive."
514,00:34:54,00:34:56,The current never even made it past zero.
515,00:34:56,00:35:00,"So, either your theory is wrong, or you've got a problem with your experiment."
516,00:35:00,00:35:04,Are there any variables in the case that haven't been duplicated here?
517,00:35:04,00:35:06,"Same vehicle, power's good."
518,00:35:06,00:35:08,"So, why isn't Mr. Wiggles connecting?"
519,00:35:11,00:35:14,He's naked.
520,00:35:14,00:35:18,"Well, let's dress him up."
521,00:35:24,00:35:25,(engine starting)
522,00:35:39,00:35:44,"So, the current came into the vehicle from the roll bar, and it went out through the undercarriage."
523,00:35:44,00:35:46,It needed an entry point and exit point.
524,00:35:46,00:35:51,"Entry through the, uh, the watch on his wrist and then exit through the rivets in his shorts."
525,00:35:51,00:35:54,"Right across his heart, stopping it cold."
526,00:36:09,00:36:15,"So I know that I've never said this to you guys before, but... hide the evidence."
527,00:36:16,00:36:17,Thanks for getting our back.
528,00:36:17,00:36:20,"We're a team, guys."
529,00:36:20,00:36:22,"Oh, since we're a team, you gonna help us clean up?"
530,00:36:22,00:36:23,Yeah. (laughing)
531,00:36:25,00:36:27,No. I'm the boss.
532,00:36:31,00:36:35,I thought you told me you closed the Cory Demayo case.
533,00:36:35,00:36:39,"Catherine, nothing happens in this lab that I don't know about."
534,00:36:39,00:36:42,Then I'm sure you know the case is now closed.
535,00:36:42,00:36:44,Did I make a mistake promoting you?
536,00:36:44,00:36:48,"Yeah, you should have given me the day shift."
537,00:36:48,00:36:49,But I'm making it work.
538,00:37:26,00:37:29,(punk rock music playing faintly)
539,00:37:30,00:37:31,Greg.
540,00:37:33,00:37:34,"Hey, MTV boy."
541,00:37:37,00:37:38,I have a question about your report.
542,00:37:38,00:37:39,Okay.
543,00:37:39,00:37:43,"According to autopsy, the victim showed long-term effects of cocaine abuse."
544,00:37:43,00:37:44,That's right.
545,00:37:44,00:37:50,"But according to Tox, the substance in the victim's syringe was a seven percent solution of morphine."
546,00:37:50,00:37:52,Yeah.
547,00:37:52,00:37:53,The victim was an obsessive compulsive.
548,00:37:53,00:37:59,"In the stories, Holmes' preferred stimulant was a seven percent solution of cocaine, not morphine."
549,00:38:00,00:38:02,Evidence out of context.
550,00:38:02,00:38:08,Did you ever consider the possibility that the victim didn't realize what he was injecting himself with?
551,00:38:08,00:38:10,No.
552,00:38:11,00:38:15,You think someone switched his coke with morphine?
553,00:38:15,00:38:20,"You found the victim's fingerprints on the gun, but you found no prints on the surgical tubing, no epithelials either."
554,00:38:20,00:38:23,Does that make sense if it was a suicide?
555,00:38:24,00:38:26,I guess not.
556,00:38:26,00:38:30,Do you have any other suspects who have access to morphine or surgical tubing?
557,00:38:32,00:38:34,I can find out.
558,00:38:34,00:38:36,I would do that.
559,00:38:47,00:38:50,SANDERS: I went through the medical records for all of our suspects.
560,00:38:51,00:38:55,"As far as I can tell, none of them have ever been prescribed morphine."
561,00:38:55,00:38:57,I think Watson's our best bet.
562,00:38:57,00:39:02,The guy is a security guard at Desert Palms; he was certainly around morphine.
563,00:39:07,00:39:09,GRISSOM: Tobacco leaves.
564,00:39:10,00:39:12,Run a quick comparison.
565,00:39:12,00:39:14,This has to belong to one of our suspects.
566,00:39:17,00:39:19,BRASS: Do you like your life?
567,00:39:19,00:39:21,What kind of question is that?
568,00:39:21,00:39:25,"Well, I mean, I've seen how happy you are at work."
569,00:39:25,00:39:30,And then I know you come home to Mom and I guess she has terminal cancer.
570,00:39:30,00:39:30,That's got to be tough.
571,00:39:30,00:39:34,"Yeah, well, you try giving enough attention to someone who never gave you any."
572,00:39:34,00:39:38,"But the Sherlock Holmes club, that's got to be one bright spot, hmm?"
573,00:39:38,00:39:43,The one place I could go every week where no one was grabbing my butt or staring at my breasts.
574,00:39:43,00:39:45,"The one place I could talk, think."
575,00:39:45,00:39:53,"You must have been pretty devastated when Dennis Kingsley decided to break up the club, huh?"
576,00:39:53,00:39:55,It was a disappointment.
577,00:39:55,00:40:00,Next week will be the final meeting of our society.
578,00:40:00,00:40:08,"But I give you my word, it shall be an evening none of you will ever forget."
579,00:40:08,00:40:10,I think it's a lot more than that.
580,00:40:10,00:40:12,I don't know what you mean.
581,00:40:12,00:40:15,Well...
582,00:40:15,00:40:20,the tobacco-- your blend is Cavendish.
583,00:40:22,00:40:28,"Okay, why don't I tell this like a story, you know, like the end of a story, all right?"
584,00:40:28,00:40:31,Because I like the part where the detectives solves the crime.
585,00:40:31,00:40:32,So here goes.
586,00:40:32,00:40:35,"On the day of the murder, you broke into Denny Kingsley's house."
587,00:40:35,00:40:37,"That's easy enough, the lock's crummy."
588,00:40:37,00:40:38,You snuck downstairs.
589,00:40:38,00:40:43,"You replaced his cocaine with morphine, because you knew he was a creature of habit."
590,00:40:43,00:40:44,So now all you had to do is wait.
591,00:40:58,00:41:03,So you sprinkle some of Dr. Watson's pipe tobacco in the carpet.
592,00:41:03,00:41:08,"You scoop up some of Denny's blood, to splash on Watson's shoes later."
593,00:41:08,00:41:11,Why the elaborate frame-up of Watson?
594,00:41:11,00:41:13,He had as much to lose as you.
595,00:41:13,00:41:17,Because he's the one that told Denny to give it all up and go back to his family.
596,00:41:17,00:41:22,"Because he's the one that wanted to be Sherlock Holmes, because he didn't care what it was doing to me."
597,00:41:24,00:41:27,(sniffling)
598,00:41:31,00:41:34,"You see, Detective..."
599,00:41:36,00:41:41,(in British accent): Denny would have wanted his murder to be the perfect puzzle.
600,00:41:41,00:41:46,A mystery worthy of the master.
601,00:41:56,00:42:00,"Hey, Greg, Grissom wants to see you."
602,00:42:00,00:42:03,"Like now, in his office."
603,00:42:14,00:42:15,Grissom.
604,00:42:15,00:42:16,You wanted to see me.
605,00:42:20,00:42:22,Yeah!
606,00:42:22,00:42:24,Yeah.
607,00:42:28,00:42:30,Well done.
608,00:42:30,00:42:32,I'm proud of you.
609,00:42:32,00:42:34,"Congratulations, Sanders. Good work."
610,00:42:34,00:42:36,Thank you.
611,00:42:37,00:42:40,"Okay, gang, there's people to put in jail."
612,00:42:40,00:42:42,"Let's get back to it, shall we?"
613,00:42:42,00:42:43,"Come on, come on, now."
614,00:42:43,00:42:45,Party's over. Let's go.
615,00:42:48,00:42:49,Good job.
616,00:42:52,00:42:54,I don't get it.
617,00:42:54,00:42:58,"I got the wrong guy, the wrong manner of death."
618,00:42:58,00:43:01,I don't expect you to be correct in all your interpretations all the time.
619,00:43:01,00:43:03,You collected the evidence.
620,00:43:03,00:43:08,"You thought there was something missing, you went back and found it."
621,00:43:08,00:43:10,"Hey, that's the job."
622,00:43:10,00:43:12,"Congratulations, Greg."
623,00:43:12,00:43:15,Thank you.
624,00:43:22,00:43:24,(all laughing)
625,00:43:24,00:43:26,Cheers. To you.
