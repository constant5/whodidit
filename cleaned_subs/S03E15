0	00:00:12	00:00:13	Turn around.
1	00:00:16	00:00:17	Go ahead.
2	00:00:17	00:00:18	Next.
3	00:00:31	00:00:33	My kitty's pierced.
4	00:00:34	00:00:35	Want to see?
5	00:00:52	00:00:54	Angels, devils...
6	00:00:54	00:01:00	virgins and sinners, let the foam take you away to your deepest desires.
7	00:01:00	00:01:03	Cleanse yourself.
8	00:01:03	00:01:05	There's no turning back now.
9	00:01:48	00:01:50	Ever been to a foam party?
10	00:01:50	00:01:51	What do you think?
11	00:01:51	00:01:54	Things can get pretty wild.
12	00:01:54	00:01:57	Evidently.
13	00:01:57	00:01:58	You got an I.D. on this guy?
14	00:01:58	00:02:00	Yeah, the deceased is Trey Buchman.
15	00:02:00	00:02:02	Age 21. I got a Vegas I.D.
16	00:02:02	00:02:03	Eyewitnesses?
17	00:02:03	00:02:06	Uh, too much foam.
18	00:02:06	00:02:07	The party was over.
19	00:02:07	00:02:09	Most of the responsible young adults had split.
20	00:02:09	00:02:11	It's amazing how the sight of blood can clear a room.
21	00:02:11	00:02:12	Yeah. I'll tell you what we got.
22	00:02:12	00:02:16	My guys are talking with the girl who found the body, but even sober, she's not going to be much help.
23	00:02:17	00:02:18	Wonder what made this wound?
24	00:02:18	00:02:20	Looks like a puncture.
25	00:02:20	00:02:22	Ice pick, maybe?
26	00:02:23	00:02:25	Well, wow, tell you it's not for the money.
27	00:02:26	00:02:29	I got about three grand here, all in C-notes.
28	00:02:29	00:02:31	Proves the old adage.
29	00:02:31	00:02:32	Which adage is that?
30	00:02:32	00:02:34	You can't take it with you.
31	00:03:08	00:03:11	Foam at the Sinner's Den.
32	00:03:11	00:03:12	I hung out here a few times.
33	00:03:12	00:03:13	Never been.
34	00:03:14	00:03:16	Your knucklehead boyfriend never took you on the party circuit?
35	00:03:16	00:03:17	Uh, pass.
36	00:03:17	00:03:19	That's cool about Vegas.
37	00:03:19	00:03:27	Rain at the Palms, EDEN at Studio 54, RAW at the Luxor, Thursday's Baby's...
38	00:03:27	00:03:30	Hey, look. Some kid dropped dead.
39	00:03:30	00:03:31	It's a shame.
40	00:03:31	00:03:33	Kids OD all the time in nightclubs.
41	00:03:33	00:03:34	They're big boys and girls. This ain't church.
42	00:03:34	00:03:36	I understand that.
43	00:03:36	00:03:40	You understand. You know the kind of rent I pay on a joint like this? Rain or shine, I owe the landlord $50,000.
44	00:03:40	00:03:41	You're breaking my heart, pal.
45	00:03:41	00:03:43	Look, here's how this works.
46	00:03:43	00:03:45	The more you cooperate the sooner you'll be up and running.
47	00:03:45	00:03:47	You don't get it. No, I get it.
48	00:03:47	00:03:49	I got a daughter who's 20, she hangs out.
49	00:03:49	00:03:54	I don't want her to die in a place like this, so do me a favor, get me the VIP list for tonight.
50	00:03:54	00:03:56	And smarten up.
51	00:04:08	00:04:11	There's seminal fluid all over the place.
52	00:04:11	00:04:13	Is this a dance club or a sex club?
53	00:04:13	00:04:15	It's a little of both.
54	00:04:15	00:04:17	Don't you love this town?
55	00:04:17	00:04:19	Whatever you say, Superfly.
56	00:04:26	00:04:28	You guys smell that?
57	00:04:28	00:04:29	Mm-hmm.
58	00:04:30	00:04:31	Smells like strawberries.
59	00:04:31	00:04:33	It's the foam.
60	00:04:33	00:04:35	Reminds me of the Mirage.
61	00:04:35	00:04:41	Steve Wynn didn't like the smell of the volcano erupting, so he changed the fuel mixture.
62	00:04:41	00:04:43	Now it smells like a piña colada.
63	00:04:46	00:04:47	Hey.
64	00:04:47	00:04:49	I got a line on our vic.
65	00:04:49	00:04:52	Trey Buchman, booked a room at the Sphere.
66	00:04:52	00:04:54	E-Wing, room 937.
67	00:05:06	00:05:08	These people are freaks.
68	00:05:10	00:05:12	Got a long dark hair.
69	00:05:15	00:05:16	Vic had short hair.
70	00:05:19	00:05:22	One of our freaks wears pussycat pink.
71	00:05:22	00:05:24	The battle was fierce.
72	00:05:24	00:05:30	The evil sorceress had powerful magic, but the prince was brave and true.
73	00:05:32	00:05:41	Finally, the brave prince slew the sorceress-dragon and went to awaken his beloved princess.
74	00:05:41	00:05:42	You're late, Eddie.
75	00:05:43	00:05:44	Don't start.
76	00:05:44	00:05:46	He climbed the many stairs to the top...
77	00:05:46	00:05:49	You know how much this meant to Lindsey?
78	00:05:49	00:05:51	Can we argue about this later, okay?
79	00:05:53	00:05:56	Her eyes would open with true love's kiss.
80	00:05:56	00:05:58	She's so beautiful.
81	00:05:58	00:05:59	Give me that.
82	00:06:04	00:06:06	Nice perfume.
83	00:06:09	00:06:11	My...
84	00:06:11	00:06:12	Okay.
85	00:06:12	00:06:13	Fine.
86	00:06:14	00:06:15	Is this okay?
87	00:06:15	00:06:16	My prince...
88	00:06:21	00:06:23	My prince...
89	00:06:23	00:06:24	at long last, you've come for me.
90	00:06:24	00:06:26	My...
91	00:06:27	00:06:29	My, my prince...
92	00:06:29	00:06:34	At long last, you've come for me.
93	00:06:43	00:06:45	I'm sorry, baby. You did good, though.
94	00:06:45	00:06:48	Yeah, you were fine, Linds. Great.
95	00:06:48	00:06:50	Hey, and you know what?
96	00:06:50	00:06:53	It's just a play.
97	00:06:53	00:06:54	No, it's not just a play.
98	00:06:54	00:06:57	I was Sleeping Beauty and you guys ruined it.
99	00:06:57	00:06:58	I'm sorry, honey.
100	00:06:58	00:07:03	Hey, I'll bet if you ask Mrs. Parker, she'd let you keep that blue dress.
101	00:07:03	00:07:05	I want to go home.
102	00:07:05	00:07:06	Okay.
103	00:07:06	00:07:08	Let's go home.
104	00:07:08	00:07:09	No, Mom.
105	00:07:09	00:07:11	I want to go with Dad.
106	00:07:12	00:07:14	You sure about that?
107	00:07:16	00:07:17	Okay.
108	00:07:19	00:07:23	Tox report on your foam guy came back negative.
109	00:07:24	00:07:25	Negative?
110	00:07:25	00:07:29	No drugs, no alcohol, no medication, not even an aspirin.
111	00:07:29	00:07:30	That's odd.
112	00:07:30	00:07:32	It was a den of iniquity.
113	00:07:33	00:07:35	What about the neck wound?
114	00:07:35	00:07:39	The sternocleidomastoid muscle and the jugular vein were lacerated.
115	00:07:42	00:07:44	The wound was a bloody mess, probably lethal.
116	00:07:44	00:07:46	Any idea what caused it?
117	00:07:46	00:07:47	Hard to say.
118	00:07:47	00:07:49	Definitely an odd entry wound.
119	00:07:49	00:07:51	Not a knife or sharp object.
120	00:07:51	00:07:54	Probably something blunt, like a pen or a stake of some sort.
121	00:07:54	00:07:55	Anything else?
122	00:07:55	00:07:57	Check this out.
123	00:08:00	00:08:01	Looks like a bite.
124	00:08:01	00:08:04	Spider bite or allergic reaction, maybe?
125	00:08:04	00:08:05	Stand by.
126	00:08:05	00:08:09	I'll process the tissue in histopath, see if it's worth writing home about.
127	00:08:14	00:08:17	I was wondering where I put my nice silver satin thong.
128	00:08:17	00:08:19	Gloves.
129	00:08:22	00:08:29	Okay, we're looking for any kind of blunt object that could've been used to stab our victim in the neck.
130	00:08:33	00:08:35	Glow stick.
131	00:08:37	00:08:38	Ball-point pen.
132	00:08:40	00:08:41	Cell phone antenna.
133	00:08:43	00:08:44	You have the Luminol?
134	00:08:46	00:08:48	Thank you.
135	00:08:58	00:08:59	Nothing.
136	00:09:04	00:09:05	Are we sure it was a blunt object?
137	00:09:14	00:09:16	Size ten, double A.
138	00:09:16	00:09:18	Stilettos, huh?
139	00:09:18	00:09:21	Brings out the toes, accentuates the legs.
140	00:09:21	00:09:23	Murder on the ankles, though.
141	00:09:29	00:09:32	Looks like murder to me.
142	00:09:35	00:09:40	Sinner's Den, SRO, I'm on every club's VIP list.
143	00:09:40	00:09:41	Well, you got lucky.
144	00:09:41	00:09:42	You're on my list now.
145	00:09:42	00:09:44	I don't want to be on your list.
146	00:09:44	00:09:45	Here, hold this. ( scoffs )
147	00:09:45	00:09:47	Nice shoes.
148	00:09:47	00:09:48	Thank you.
149	00:09:48	00:09:49	Okay, this is the story.
150	00:09:50	00:09:54	One of you lovely Cinderellas is missing a glass slipper and I'm playing the prince.
151	00:09:54	00:09:58	So would each of you remove your right shoe, please?
152	00:10:01	00:10:03	Doesn't fit.
153	00:10:11	00:10:12	Almost.
154	00:10:16	00:10:18	Hi.
155	00:10:22	00:10:24	No.
156	00:10:33	00:10:36	Well, if the shoe fits...
157	00:10:36	00:10:37	Wear it.
158	00:10:43	00:10:45	Comfortable?
159	00:10:45	00:10:46	So far.
160	00:10:46	00:10:48	Thanks for asking.
161	00:10:49	00:10:52	You want to tell me how your shoe ended up in Trey Buchman's neck?
162	00:10:56	00:10:58	I don't know.
163	00:10:58	00:11:03	Last I remember, the foam was rising...
164	00:11:03	00:11:09	and my heel went into something... soft.
165	00:11:10	00:11:12	Thought it was someone's foot.
166	00:11:13	00:11:14	Jugular.
167	00:11:14	00:11:15	There's a slight difference.
168	00:11:15	00:11:18	Do you want to tell me why you left your shoe behind?
169	00:11:18	00:11:20	Heel broke.
170	00:11:20	00:11:22	And the fact it had blood on it, that wasn't the reason?
171	00:11:22	00:11:24	Never saw blood.
172	00:11:24	00:11:25	I see.
173	00:11:25	00:11:32	I did some checking-- because that's what I do-- and you and our victim had a relationship a while back.
174	00:11:32	00:11:40	I've relationshipped about a dozen guys on the circuit, including Trey.
175	00:11:40	00:11:43	Nothing ends-- we still all meet up at the club.
176	00:11:43	00:11:44	I see.
177	00:11:54	00:12:04	And the way he gave it to me, believe me, he's the last guy I'd want dead.
178	00:12:08	00:12:09	Excuse me, Jim.
179	00:12:09	00:12:10	Am I interrupting something?
180	00:12:10	00:12:12	Gil, please.
181	00:12:15	00:12:17	Miss... ( donning rubber gloves )
182	00:12:17	00:12:19	I'm going to need a sample of your DNA.
183	00:12:19	00:12:21	How do you want it?
184	00:12:21	00:12:23	I like your hair.
185	00:12:23	00:12:25	I like yours.
186	00:12:26	00:12:27	Are you a, uh, natural blonde?
187	00:12:35	00:12:36	Ow.
188	00:12:36	00:12:37	Sorry.
189	00:12:37	00:12:40	I needed a follicular tag.
190	00:12:41	00:12:42	Thank you.
191	00:12:43	00:12:45	Gil?
192	00:12:46	00:12:48	Any chance you found my thong?
193	00:12:48	00:12:52	Silver lamÃ©, probably twisted in knots.
194	00:12:52	00:12:53	Oh, yeah, we did.
195	00:12:53	00:12:55	You'll need to fill out a form, though.
196	00:12:55	00:12:56	The captain will help you.
197	00:12:56	00:12:58	Surely.
198	00:13:47	00:13:49	Hey, Gil?
199	00:13:51	00:13:53	Carmen?
200	00:13:57	00:13:59	Right after the murder.
201	00:13:59	00:14:01	Opera makes it all seem so lovely.
202	00:14:01	00:14:06	And at the risk of sounding like your mother, you're to ruin your eardrums.
203	00:14:07	00:14:10	Our victim's tissue-- Trey Buchman.
204	00:14:10	00:14:16	The, uh, circular contusions I sectioned, indicate damage extending only 30 microns below the epidermis.
205	00:14:16	00:14:19	So it's not a bug bite.
206	00:14:19	00:14:21	Man-made, high-pressure, subcutaneous injector.
207	00:14:21	00:14:22	No needle?
208	00:14:22	00:14:25	Simply high pressure penetrating the skin.
209	00:14:31	00:14:32	Did you send a sample to tox?
210	00:14:32	00:14:35	Our victim was injected with insulin.
211	00:14:35	00:14:37	Diabetic?
212	00:14:37	00:14:38	Nope.
213	00:14:38	00:14:40	So cause of death was insulin shock.
214	00:14:41	00:14:48	Insulin doesn't make for a narcotic or hallucinogenic high so I don't know why Buchman would take the stuff.
215	00:14:48	00:14:50	Downstairs neighbor smelled it.
216	00:14:50	00:14:52	Called the plumber.
217	00:14:52	00:14:54	Yeah, they always think it's a sewage problem.
218	00:14:54	00:14:56	( cell phone ringing ) Phew!
219	00:14:57	00:14:59	Eddie?
220	00:15:00	00:15:02	Ed? Hello?
221	00:15:02	00:15:03	Uh... bad connection, Ed.
222	00:15:04	00:15:06	Uh, I just entered a scene.
223	00:15:06	00:15:07	I-I'll call you later.
224	00:15:07	00:15:09	Whew.
225	00:15:09	00:15:12	No pain, no gain.
226	00:15:12	00:15:14	Purge fluid.
227	00:15:14	00:15:16	D.U.N.S.
228	00:15:19	00:15:20	Dead Upstairs Neighbor Syndrome.
229	00:15:21	00:15:25	Mm-hmm. Yeah, well, it's going to take us a while to get this smell out of our nose hairs.
230	00:15:25	00:15:27	Parchment changes of the skin.
231	00:15:27	00:15:30	So what's the exposure to that window, south?
232	00:15:30	00:15:31	East.
233	00:15:31	00:15:33	Gets direct sunlight half the day.
234	00:15:33	00:15:34	I learned that down in Lauderdale.
235	00:15:34	00:15:36	You know, you've got to remember to turn.
236	00:15:36	00:15:39	Right, all that spring break activity with your frat brothers.
237	00:15:39	00:15:41	Well, something like that.
238	00:15:41	00:15:44	Nice little cocaine fingernail.
239	00:15:44	00:15:47	So... no mail built up.
240	00:15:47	00:15:50	I don't see a telephone.
241	00:15:50	00:15:53	What do you think? ( cell phone ringing )
242	00:15:53	00:15:54	Howard Hughes in a studio apartment?
243	00:15:55	00:15:57	Eddie?
244	00:15:57	00:15:58	Ed?
245	00:15:58	00:16:00	Now what's his deal?
246	00:16:00	00:16:02	Lindsey's with him.
247	00:16:02	00:16:04	Maybe she's ready to come home.
248	00:16:04	00:16:05	Yeah, I bet.
249	00:16:35	00:16:38	How you doing?
250	00:16:38	00:16:41	Cash and a very busy passport.
251	00:16:44	00:16:45	Designer threads.
252	00:16:45	00:16:48	Ten-to-one, Croix Richards is a drug dealer.
253	00:16:48	00:16:50	And that is no workout accident.
254	00:16:56	00:16:59	Eddie?
255	00:16:59	00:17:01	Eddie, you've got to get to a land line.
256	00:17:01	00:17:02	This connection sucks.
257	00:17:02	00:17:04	Mommy... ( static )
258	00:17:04	00:17:06	Lindsey?
259	00:17:06	00:17:09	H-Honey, I-I can't hear you.
260	00:17:09	00:17:12	Mommy... please... scared... all alone. ( crying )
261	00:17:12	00:17:13	You're alone?
262	00:17:13	00:17:15	Well, honey, where's Daddy?
263	00:17:15	00:17:17	Daddy... ( static )
264	00:17:17	00:17:18	You want me to just...? Uh...
265	00:17:18	00:17:20	Thanks-- uh, yeah, honey.
266	00:17:20	00:17:22	Yes, yes, I'm coming.
267	00:17:22	00:17:23	Mommy, please!
268	00:17:23	00:17:26	I'm scared... all alone!
269	00:17:26	00:17:29	We were in the car, going fast.
270	00:17:29	00:17:30	We hit something.
271	00:17:30	00:17:32	It's going to be okay, honey.
272	00:17:32	00:17:33	I'm on my way.
273	00:17:33	00:17:35	I just need to know where you are.
274	00:17:35	00:17:36	I don't know.
275	00:17:36	00:17:37	There's lots of water.
276	00:17:37	00:17:38	Are you near a lake?
277	00:17:38	00:17:40	Are you near Grandma's house?
278	00:17:40	00:17:43	No, the water's in the car.
279	00:17:44	00:17:45	In the car?
280	00:17:45	00:17:47	Lindsey, can you get out?
281	00:17:47	00:17:49	No.
282	00:17:49	00:17:52	It's going to be okay, honey.
283	00:17:52	00:17:54	Just listen to me.
284	00:17:54	00:17:57	Before the car crashed, where were you going?
285	00:17:57	00:17:59	Daddy said the hospital.
286	00:17:59	00:18:01	On the way there, did you see any hotels?
287	00:18:01	00:18:03	I saw the castle.
288	00:18:03	00:18:04	Excalibur.
289	00:18:04	00:18:06	Did you see, did you see the pyramid?
290	00:18:06	00:18:07	Yeah.
291	00:18:08	00:18:09	Industrial Road?
292	00:18:09	00:18:10	Is that, is that it?
293	00:18:10	00:18:12	Lindsey, is it Industrial Road?
294	00:18:12	00:18:13	There was a bridge.
295	00:18:13	00:18:14	We went through a fence.
296	00:18:14	00:18:17	( static ) Lindsey?
297	00:18:41	00:18:42	Lindsey!
298	00:18:42	00:18:43	Lindsey!
299	00:18:44	00:18:46	Hang on, honey!
300	00:19:01	00:19:02	Mommy! I'm here, honey.
301	00:19:02	00:19:04	Mommy! I'm going to get you out.
302	00:19:04	00:19:05	Hang on.
303	00:19:09	00:19:10	Okay.
304	00:19:10	00:19:13	Listen. I have to break the window, okay?
305	00:19:13	00:19:15	You've got to move to the front.
306	00:19:15	00:19:16	Mommy, I can't!
307	00:19:16	00:19:17	I can't.
308	00:19:18	00:19:20	Okay, I'm going to come around, okay?
309	00:19:20	00:19:21	I'm coming around.
310	00:19:21	00:19:23	Please, Mommy.
311	00:19:26	00:19:28	Lindsey!
312	00:19:29	00:19:30	I'm going to go down.
313	00:19:30	00:19:32	I'm going to go down.
314	00:19:53	00:19:55	You all right? You okay?
315	00:19:55	00:19:56	Mommy. Yes?
316	00:19:56	00:19:58	I got you. Hold on.
317	00:20:05	00:20:09	The lady who was driving had pink hair.
318	00:20:09	00:20:11	I don't remember her name.
319	00:20:11	00:20:14	But Lindsey, it was your father's car.
320	00:20:14	00:20:16	Why wasn't he driving it?
321	00:20:16	00:20:19	He had a stomachache.
322	00:20:20	00:20:21	Hang on. We'll get to the hospital.
323	00:20:21	00:20:22	I can't make it.
324	00:20:24	00:20:29	The lady got out, and then Daddy fell out.
325	00:20:29	00:20:31	He didn't come back.
326	00:20:31	00:20:33	Catherine?
327	00:20:38	00:20:41	Is Eddie the kind of guy that would leave his daughter abandoned in the back of a car?
328	00:20:41	00:20:42	Never, never, never, no.
329	00:20:43	00:20:44	He loves Lindsey. He'd never do that.
330	00:20:44	00:20:46	Not willingly.
331	00:20:50	00:20:52	Be careful with my car, boys.
332	00:20:52	00:20:54	Mom?
333	00:20:56	00:20:58	He's dead, isn't he?
334	00:21:01	00:21:03	I don't know, baby. I...
335	00:21:04	00:21:06	I'm going to go look for him, though.
336	00:21:06	00:21:08	I'm just going to be right over there.
337	00:21:08	00:21:12	Okay, that's enough.
338	00:21:12	00:21:14	I want you to stay here with Detective Vega.
339	00:21:14	00:21:17	Okay?
340	00:21:19	00:21:21	How you doing?
341	00:21:21	00:21:23	Want some cocoa or something?
342	00:22:01	00:22:02	Drugs.
343	00:22:02	00:22:06	Knowing Eddie's taste in women, I'd say that's a good bet.
344	00:22:06	00:22:09	Hey, Catherine, you want to give me that?
345	00:22:10	00:22:12	You shouldn't be handling evidence.
346	00:22:12	00:22:13	You're not on the case.
347	00:22:24	00:22:27	Stop it right there.
348	00:22:29	00:22:30	Hey, Doc.
349	00:22:31	00:22:33	Hey.
350	00:22:33	00:22:36	I thought I'd come and get an update on...
351	00:22:36	00:22:38	Stinky here.
352	00:22:38	00:22:39	Whew!
353	00:22:39	00:22:40	Wow, that's horrible.
354	00:22:40	00:22:47	I'm generally immune to the stench of a decomp, but, uh, two weeks of decay still tickles the vibrassae of my nasal vestibule.
355	00:22:47	00:22:49	Yeah, I'll say.
356	00:22:49	00:22:51	Hey, what's the foreign body lodged in his femur?
357	00:22:51	00:22:53	Crank up the milliamps.
358	00:22:55	00:22:59	Whiter than bone.
359	00:22:59	00:23:01	Dense like a metal.
360	00:23:01	00:23:04	What exactly are we looking at?
361	00:23:04	00:23:06	Let's find out.
362	00:23:07	00:23:09	Whew!
363	00:23:22	00:23:27	I feel like Androcles pulling the thorn from a lion's paw.
364	00:23:28	00:23:30	Looks like the tip of a needle.
365	00:23:30	00:23:32	It probably broke off when it hit the bone.
366	00:23:36	00:23:38	I've started to see into the future.
367	00:23:38	00:23:43	Thanks to credit card reports, I see that our phone victim booked a room at the Tangiers for tonight.
368	00:23:43	00:23:44	He was staying at the Sphere.
369	00:23:44	00:23:46	Two hotel rooms in one night.
370	00:23:46	00:23:47	He was a busy boy.
371	00:23:55	00:23:58	Hello.
372	00:23:58	00:24:00	Hello.
373	00:24:00	00:24:01	You're late.
374	00:24:01	00:24:03	Not-not that I mind.
375	00:24:03	00:24:06	There's two of you?
376	00:24:06	00:24:09	We work as a team.
377	00:24:09	00:24:11	What's in the kit?
378	00:24:11	00:24:16	Latex gloves, cotton swabs, specimen jars, other evidence-gathering stuff.
379	00:24:16	00:24:18	Wait a minute.
380	00:24:18	00:24:20	Uh, what's going on here?
381	00:24:20	00:24:21	You tell us.
382	00:24:21	00:24:23	Oh, my God.
383	00:24:23	00:24:25	You guys are cops.
384	00:24:26	00:24:27	I'm, um...
385	00:24:27	00:24:29	I'm really embarrassed.
386	00:24:29	00:24:32	I've never done anything like this before.
387	00:24:32	00:24:33	I swear.
388	00:24:33	00:24:35	This room is registered to Trey Buchman.
389	00:24:35	00:24:37	Who are you?
390	00:24:37	00:24:39	Do we have to do names?
391	00:24:39	00:24:40	Uh-huh.
392	00:24:40	00:24:41	Rebecca McCormick.
393	00:24:41	00:24:47	Look, I got a number from a guy who was giving out these cards on the Strip.
394	00:24:47	00:24:49	I thought it would be fun.
395	00:24:49	00:24:51	I-I don't know what I was thinking.
396	00:24:51	00:24:54	Am I under arrest?
397	00:24:54	00:24:55	Not yet.
398	00:25:07	00:25:08	Hey.
399	00:25:08	00:25:09	Cracked my D.B.'s laptop.
400	00:25:09	00:25:11	Got his appointment book.
401	00:25:13	00:25:14	Women's names.
402	00:25:14	00:25:16	Hotels.
403	00:25:16	00:25:18	Blocks of time.
404	00:25:18	00:25:22	You know, Croix had this sweet apartment and this wad of cash.
405	00:25:22	00:25:23	We thought he was selling drugs.
406	00:25:23	00:25:24	He was selling himself.
407	00:25:24	00:25:25	Gigolo.
408	00:25:25	00:25:26	Paid to get laid.
409	00:25:26	00:25:27	So was mine.
410	00:25:27	00:25:29	Two victims, same profession.
411	00:25:30	00:25:31	Ooh.
412	00:25:31	00:25:33	What about the needle you found in the decomp?
413	00:25:33	00:25:35	The micrometer pegged it as a 30-gauge.
414	00:25:35	00:25:39	Insulin dependents use needles that thin.
415	00:25:39	00:25:40	Well, the decomp's too severe.
416	00:25:40	00:25:43	We'll never get anything out of tox or the needle.
417	00:25:43	00:25:45	I think we're working the same case.
418	00:25:47	00:25:49	Well, good thing my gigolo was organized.
419	00:25:49	00:25:53	He used accounting software to keep track of his finances.
420	00:25:53	00:25:54	Employment history?
421	00:26:15	00:26:20	Mr. Grissom, Captain Brass, ( screaming continues ) so nice to see you again.
422	00:26:20	00:26:22	Good to hear things haven't changed around here.
423	00:26:22	00:26:24	I see you haven't changed, either.
424	00:26:24	00:26:27	Trey Buchman, Croix Richards.
425	00:26:27	00:26:30	They're both on my payroll.
426	00:26:30	00:26:31	Hard workers, quite skilled.
427	00:26:31	00:26:33	They're deceased.
428	00:26:33	00:26:35	They'll be missed.
429	00:26:35	00:26:37	Last year, you lost Mona Taylor.
430	00:26:37	00:26:39	Now, two more employees.
431	00:26:39	00:26:40	It's a risky business.
432	00:26:40	00:26:42	Accusation?
433	00:26:42	00:26:43	It's an observation.
434	00:26:43	00:26:49	These guys traded in sex, and I know you don't allow intercourse in your domain.
435	00:26:49	00:26:51	Now, that is an accusation.
436	00:26:51	00:26:56	I profit from the theatrics of pleasure, allowing people to play out their fantasies.
437	00:26:56	00:26:59	Trey and Croix were independent contractors.
438	00:26:59	00:27:03	Lady Heather, what services did they provide?
439	00:27:05	00:27:06	Bad little pig boy.
440	00:27:06	00:27:08	Bad, bad, bad.
441	00:27:08	00:27:11	...you naughty, bad pig.
442	00:27:12	00:27:27	Oinky, sloppy pig.
443	00:27:27	00:27:28	You're right.
444	00:27:28	00:27:29	I deserve to be punished.
445	00:27:29	00:27:30	Mommy says no.
446	00:27:30	00:27:32	I said, no.
447	00:27:32	00:27:35	Oh...
448	00:27:35	00:27:36	Who needs the belt?
449	00:27:36	00:27:39	Here it comes.
450	00:27:39	00:27:40	Say you're sorry.
451	00:27:40	00:27:42	I'm sorry.
452	00:27:44	00:27:46	My dominion is also my domain.
453	00:27:46	00:27:48	Ladyheather.com.
454	00:27:48	00:27:52	So, Buchman and Richards were down here doing Internet porn, huh?
455	00:27:52	00:27:53	Not porn.
456	00:27:53	00:27:55	Voyeurism in a brave new world.
457	00:27:55	00:27:57	What would Aldous Huxley say?
458	00:27:57	00:28:02	If his credit card were valid, he could say anything he wanted at $3.95 a minute.
459	00:28:02	00:28:03	Do you like my lipstick?
460	00:28:07	00:28:08	Why?
461	00:28:08	00:28:10	You've been staring at my lips.
462	00:28:10	00:28:11	You have lovely lips.
463	00:28:16	00:28:17	And a very successful business.
464	00:28:17	00:28:20	Thanks. Thanks for your time.
465	00:28:23	00:28:26	See you soon.
466	00:28:31	00:28:36	So, after your recital, where did your dad take you?
467	00:28:36	00:28:37	Leatherbey's.
468	00:28:37	00:28:38	He got me a banana split.
469	00:28:39	00:28:40	I like whipped cream on mine.
470	00:28:40	00:28:42	Did he have anything to drink?
471	00:28:42	00:28:43	Did he have a beer, a glass of wine?
472	00:28:43	00:28:45	Just water.
473	00:28:51	00:28:54	So, it was just the two of you?
474	00:28:54	00:29:00	This lady you told us about-- the one who was driving, the one with the pink hair-- where did you meet her?
475	00:29:00	00:29:02	I don't know.
476	00:29:02	00:29:03	You remember, Lindsey.
477	00:29:03	00:29:04	Just think about it.
478	00:29:09	00:29:14	I fell asleep in the car, and I woke up when we stopped.
479	00:29:14	00:29:16	Was this at a house?
480	00:29:16	00:29:18	No. It was a building.
481	00:29:18	00:29:21	Was it an apartment building, maybe, or maybe an office building?
482	00:29:21	00:29:24	I don't know.
483	00:29:24	00:29:26	Why did you stop there?
484	00:29:34	00:29:38	Daddy said he had a meeting. He told me to stay in the car and keep the doors locked.
485	00:29:38	00:29:40	You mean he left you in the car alone. Catherine...
486	00:29:40	00:29:41	Mom, Mom, it's okay.
487	00:29:41	00:29:42	I said I could take care of myself.
488	00:29:43	00:29:44	I told him I could stay in the car.
489	00:29:44	00:29:45	Just don't be mad at him.
490	00:29:45	00:29:47	He didn't do anything wrong.
491	00:29:47	00:29:48	It's okay, Lindsey.
492	00:29:48	00:29:50	Nobody's mad at anybody.
493	00:29:53	00:29:55	Can I talk to you for a second?
494	00:30:04	00:30:07	It's okay.
495	00:30:17	00:30:20	This lady was at the building?
496	00:30:20	00:30:23	She was outside in the parking lot.
497	00:30:23	00:30:24	Eddie.
498	00:30:24	00:30:25	Candeece! Baby!
499	00:30:25	00:30:26	Where were you? What's the matter, honey?
500	00:30:26	00:30:28	Sugar, what's the matter with you?
501	00:30:28	00:30:29	Oh!
502	00:30:29	00:30:34	This lady with the pink hair-- was she your father's girlfriend?
503	00:30:38	00:30:40	I called you a million times!
504	00:30:40	00:30:41	What are you talking about?
505	00:30:41	00:30:42	Why didn't you answer your phone?
506	00:30:43	00:30:44	Maybe.
507	00:30:44	00:30:46	Well, he was mad at her.
508	00:30:46	00:30:49	And then they, they were running back to the car.
509	00:30:49	00:30:51	Daddy was holding his stomach.
510	00:30:56	00:30:57	Daddy, what's wrong?
511	00:30:57	00:30:59	It's just a stomachache, honey.
512	00:30:59	00:31:00	I'll be fine.
513	00:31:05	00:31:07	Willows.
514	00:31:07	00:31:09	Yeah.
515	00:31:48	00:31:54	Catherine, you can't say good-bye in an autopsy room.
516	00:32:23	00:32:25	Hi, uh...
517	00:32:25	00:32:26	Croix Richards and Trey Buchman.
518	00:32:26	00:32:29	Same profession, same employer, same cause of death.
519	00:32:29	00:32:31	Yeah. Insulin poisoning.
520	00:32:31	00:32:33	Not your typical male MO.
521	00:32:33	00:32:35	Lady Heather a suspect?
522	00:32:35	00:32:36	I can't rule anybody out.
523	00:32:37	00:32:41	Catherine... I'm sorry about Eddie and your daughter.
524	00:32:41	00:32:45	If, if you'd like to take some time off or...
525	00:32:45	00:32:47	I'm okay.
526	00:32:47	00:32:51	Lindsey's...
527	00:32:51	00:32:53	We're okay.
528	00:32:57	00:32:58	Hey, Catherine.
529	00:32:58	00:32:59	Hey.
530	00:32:59	00:33:00	We heard about what happened.
531	00:33:00	00:33:02	I'm so sorry.
532	00:33:02	00:33:06	Yeah, if you or Lindsey need anything at all...
533	00:33:06	00:33:08	Thanks, you guys.
534	00:33:08	00:33:10	Why don't you catch us up.
535	00:33:10	00:33:12	Yeah.
536	00:33:12	00:33:15	Credit card transactions for Lady Heather's Web Site.
537	00:33:15	00:33:17	Both our victims worked in the chat room.
538	00:33:17	00:33:20	We cross-referenced their clients.
539	00:33:20	00:33:21	They're all ladies.
540	00:33:21	00:33:24	And looks like both victims died approximately four weeks apart.
541	00:33:25	00:33:27	Killers usually don't stray too far from home.
542	00:33:27	00:33:29	Especially for repeat crimes.
543	00:33:29	00:33:32	Yeah, I'm squeezing the Las Vegas search area.
544	00:33:36	00:33:37	Got a vial full of blue boogers.
545	00:33:37	00:33:39	GHB with food coloring.
546	00:33:39	00:33:40	That's a date rape drug.
547	00:33:40	00:33:41	Not anymore.
548	00:33:41	00:33:44	You mix it with the right stimulant, like meth, you got a great party drug.
549	00:33:44	00:33:46	Everyone's a chemist.
550	00:33:46	00:33:47	Thanks.
551	00:33:52	00:33:56	You know, we found a dark hair in Trey Buchman's hotel room at the Sphere.
552	00:33:58	00:34:00	I'll exclude everyone with light hair.
553	00:34:07	00:34:08	Whoa.
554	00:34:08	00:34:09	Stop.
555	00:34:09	00:34:10	Huh.
556	00:34:10	00:34:14	Rebecca McCormick. 235 Desert Ranch Road.
557	00:34:14	00:34:16	First time, my ass.
558	00:34:33	00:34:35	Hi. Sorry to keep you waiting.
559	00:34:35	00:34:39	So, what can I do to help out the Las Vegas Crime Lab?
560	00:34:39	00:34:41	You could tell us about your relationship with Croix Richards.
561	00:34:41	00:34:46	Well, uh, I hired Croix Richards to dominate Rebecca.
562	00:34:47	00:34:49	Would you like a chocolate?
563	00:34:49	00:34:50	Uh, they're Godiva.
564	00:34:50	00:34:52	No, thanks.
565	00:34:52	00:34:56	I guess you could say that Mr. Richards worked for me.
566	00:34:56	00:35:02	We were hoping that he might help ease some of Rebecca's sexual difficulties.
567	00:35:02	00:35:06	Extra-marital sex to help your relationship problems?
568	00:35:06	00:35:11	The problem wasn't with our relationship, it was with my wife's lack of experience.
569	00:35:11	00:35:14	Which Mr. Richards helped you with?
570	00:35:16	00:35:17	Yes.
571	00:35:17	00:35:22	First over the Internet and then we, uh, we met with him a few times.
572	00:35:22	00:35:23	We?
573	00:35:23	00:35:25	Yeah, yes.
574	00:35:25	00:35:27	I participated in the sessions, yes.
575	00:35:28	00:35:31	Do you take this man to be your wedded husband?
576	00:35:31	00:35:33	Love honor and obey.
577	00:35:33	00:35:34	Say it!
578	00:35:35	00:35:39	And these sessions were held at Lady Heather's?
579	00:35:39	00:35:40	Yes.
580	00:35:40	00:35:43	Lady Heather thought it would be best if I was involved.
581	00:35:43	00:35:47	I'm sure secrets would've made the problem worse, at that point.
582	00:35:49	00:35:53	Mrs. McCormick, did you meet Trey Buchman at Lady Heather's?
583	00:35:54	00:35:55	Oh, I'm sorry, who?
584	00:35:55	00:35:57	He worked for Lady Heather as well.
585	00:35:57	00:35:58	He's also dead.
586	00:35:59	00:36:00	Oh...
587	00:36:00	00:36:01	I don't know who Trey Buchman is.
588	00:36:01	00:36:02	Your wife does. Oh.
589	00:36:03	00:36:07	I met Trey on Lady Heather's Web Site.
590	00:36:07	00:36:09	Our encounters were only on-line.
591	00:36:09	00:36:11	Like this?
592	00:36:11	00:36:13	Is this okay?
593	00:36:13	00:36:14	No, it's not okay!
594	00:36:14	00:36:15	Don't you know how to listen, you stupid bitch?!
595	00:36:15	00:36:19	And the night you and I met at the Tangiers?
596	00:36:21	00:36:23	Croix was fun.
597	00:36:23	00:36:27	Uh, I wanted more experience. Variation.
598	00:36:27	00:36:28	I made a date with Trey.
599	00:36:28	00:36:30	He never showed up.
600	00:36:34	00:36:41	Well, Mrs. McCormick, I'd like to get a sample of your hair and DNA for comparison.
601	00:36:41	00:36:44	Rebecca will give you anything that you need.
602	00:37:48	00:37:50	Yeah, I can put you in touch with her manager, Eddie Willows.
603	00:37:50	00:37:52	Guy owes me a call.
604	00:37:52	00:37:53	Make that five calls.
605	00:37:53	00:37:56	If you talk to him, tell him he's got, like, eight hours of studio fees due.
606	00:37:56	00:37:58	The penalties are running, okay?
607	00:37:58	00:38:00	We've already seen him. He's in the morgue.
608	00:38:00	00:38:03	Oh, that makes sense why he wasn't here last night.
609	00:38:03	00:38:06	High-strung singer, no manager, that's always trouble.
610	00:38:17	00:38:19	I hate this!
611	00:38:19	00:38:20	This sucks!
612	00:38:20	00:38:21	Okay?
613	00:38:21	00:38:22	Where is Eddie?
614	00:38:22	00:38:23	I need Eddie here.
615	00:38:23	00:38:24	Get back in the booth.
616	00:38:24	00:38:25	Where are you?
617	00:38:25	00:38:27	I need you here now.
618	00:38:27	00:38:28	I cannot do this without help.
619	00:38:28	00:38:30	Can I have a little privacy, please?
620	00:38:30	00:38:32	Would you go in there and learn how to do your job?
621	00:38:32	00:38:33	It sounds terrible in there, anyways.
622	00:38:33	00:38:34	She started ragging on me.
623	00:38:34	00:38:35	I didn't need the hot air, so I came back in.
624	00:38:36	00:38:38	That's a cut, Enrique.
625	00:38:39	00:38:40	Let's take it from the bridge.
626	00:38:40	00:38:42	Eddie was just in it for the quick score.
627	00:38:42	00:38:47	Cut a demo, sell a contract, get a ride on the charts and you just ride that wave.
628	00:38:47	00:38:48	This girl was different.
629	00:38:48	00:38:50	Yeah, he was banging her.
630	00:38:50	00:38:54	Yeah, but he had something for her, knowing how much potential she had.
631	00:38:54	00:38:55	I never seen Eddie so dedicated.
632	00:38:55	00:38:57	Nothing was going to stop him from making her a star.
633	00:38:57	00:38:59	Except maybe a .22 round in his gut.
634	00:38:59	00:39:01	Stop, stop, stop. That's a cut, Enrique.
635	00:39:01	00:39:04	Whoa. It sounds good from where I'm standing-- what's up?
636	00:39:04	00:39:09	The problem isn't the vocals, man, it's the extra bass line I keep getting from the Village People outside with that damn jackhammer.
637	00:39:09	00:39:12	All right, Enrique, let's pick it up from the second chorus.
638	00:39:12	00:39:14	Aren't recording studios supposed to be soundproof?
639	00:39:14	00:39:18	Lady, if the guy standing next to you is Clive Davis, instead of a cop, it would be.
640	00:39:18	00:39:20	After Candeece left, did you guys keep recording?
641	00:39:20	00:39:21	Um, yeah, a few more hours.
642	00:39:21	00:39:23	We were redoing a drum track.
643	00:39:26	00:39:29	We're going to need to take a look at those tapes.
644	00:39:29	00:39:33	Okay, the hair on the left is from Trey Buchman's room at the Sphere hotel.
645	00:39:33	00:39:36	The hair on the right is a sample we took from Rebecca McCormick.
646	00:39:36	00:39:40	Cuticles on both are shiny and smooth.
647	00:39:40	00:39:43	Telltale signs the hair has been treated.
648	00:39:43	00:39:46	The cortex isn't letting any light through.
649	00:39:46	00:39:48	It lets us know the hair's been colored.
650	00:39:48	00:39:50	The medullas are continuous.
651	00:39:50	00:39:55	I can't be definitive without DNA, but, uh, both pairs are consistent.
652	00:39:55	00:39:56	They look like Rebecca McCormick's.
653	00:39:58	00:40:02	So she lied to you guys at the hotel, she lied to us at the house.
654	00:40:02	00:40:04	She's been with him, not just online.
655	00:40:04	00:40:08	But her husband only knew about the guy he hired, Croix Richards.
656	00:40:08	00:40:12	He had no idea that she hired Trey Buchman.
657	00:40:12	00:40:15	Steven McCormick wanted his wife to have a session.
658	00:40:15	00:40:17	It's not uncommon.
659	00:40:17	00:40:21	When a client achieves liberation, they often want their spouse to share that feeling.
660	00:40:21	00:40:28	Though in this particular instance I advised the husband to pursue avenues more suited to the temperament of his marriage.
661	00:40:28	00:40:30	I guess you couldn't say no.
662	00:40:30	00:40:33	I learned that Mr. McCormick is an investor in your Internet site.
663	00:40:33	00:40:35	That's a matter of public record.
664	00:40:35	00:40:39	Did he ever tell you, specifically, what his wife's problem was?
665	00:40:39	00:40:42	The fault lay not in his wife but in himself.
666	00:40:42	00:40:46	Steven believed his wife was repressed, but once she opened up...
667	00:40:46	00:40:48	A Pandora's Box?
668	00:40:48	00:40:52	All the evils of their marriage unleashed?
669	00:40:53	00:40:54	May I?
670	00:40:54	00:40:55	You may.
671	00:40:55	00:40:56	Thank you, Lady Heather.
672	00:41:01	00:41:05	Steven came to me three years ago in a state of confusion.
673	00:41:05	00:41:08	I helped him clarify his need for dominance.
674	00:41:08	00:41:12	You will control her only as well as you can read her.
675	00:41:15	00:41:16	Now read.
676	00:41:23	00:41:25	Our work enabled him to marry.
677	00:41:25	00:41:32	But he chose a woman who didn't understand the dynamics of a dominant-submissive relationship.
678	00:41:32	00:41:37	Unfortunately, the language we speak in here doesn't necessarily translate to the world out there.
679	00:41:37	00:41:40	No, in here, the submissive has the power.
680	00:41:40	00:41:44	All he has to do is say the safety word and everything stops.
681	00:41:47	00:41:48	Very good, Mr. Grissom.
682	00:41:48	00:41:52	I'm just repeating what I've heard.
683	00:41:52	00:41:54	You're a good listener.
684	00:41:54	00:41:55	Part of the job.
685	00:41:57	00:41:59	So this is work?
686	00:41:59	00:42:00	Yes.
687	00:42:00	00:42:02	But I value your insight.
688	00:42:02	00:42:04	I'm flattered.
689	00:42:04	00:42:08	But you already seem to know the answers to your questions.
690	00:42:08	00:42:15	You keep me in proximity when I walk away and when I'm close, you watch my lips.
691	00:42:18	00:42:20	Are you losing your hearing?
692	00:42:22	00:42:25	I'm losing my balance.
693	00:42:25	00:42:27	Your sense of self?
694	00:42:27	00:42:29	No.
695	00:42:29	00:42:31	I know who I am.
696	00:42:31	00:42:33	Do you?
697	00:42:33	00:42:36	Yes, I do.
698	00:42:53	00:42:56	You can always say stop.
699	00:42:58	00:43:01	So can you.
700	00:43:09	00:43:11	Eddie's my manager.
701	00:43:11	00:43:12	It's no big secret.
702	00:43:12	00:43:16	We were supposed to be working last night, and the jerk blew me off.
703	00:43:16	00:43:18	So you never saw him last night?
704	00:43:18	00:43:20	No. What happened to your wrist?
705	00:43:22	00:43:23	Oh, uh...
706	00:43:23	00:43:24	I got, uh...
707	00:43:24	00:43:25	um...
708	00:43:25	00:43:30	Because, uh, according to Desert Palms Emergency Room, you came in last night with a fracture of the ulna.
709	00:43:30	00:43:33	It's a common injury in car accidents-- air bag specific.
710	00:43:36	00:43:40	Air bags are packed with cornstarch or talc.
711	00:43:41	00:43:42	It helps them deploy.
712	00:43:42	00:43:44	It also wreaks havoc on the eyes.
713	00:43:44	00:43:45	We know you saw Eddie last night.
714	00:43:45	00:43:48	We know that you were driving his car.
715	00:43:49	00:43:51	It all happened so fast, you know?
716	00:43:51	00:43:57	One minute I was, I was just outside getting some air and thinking, you know?
717	00:43:57	00:44:03	And then... the next, my manager is stumbling towards me, bleeding.
718	00:44:04	00:44:05	Candeece, baby, I'm shot!
719	00:44:05	00:44:06	Eddie! Oh, my God!
720	00:44:06	00:44:09	( gasping ) I'll get you in the car.
721	00:44:09	00:44:11	Everything's going to be okay, honey.
722	00:44:11	00:44:12	Okay, don't be afraid.
723	00:44:12	00:44:14	Sounds pretty heroic.
724	00:44:14	00:44:16	Not really.
725	00:44:16	00:44:22	When you're intimate with somebody, you can't imagine life without them.
726	00:44:22	00:44:25	We were partners.
727	00:44:25	00:44:27	I loved him.
728	00:44:27	00:44:29	I thought I was going to die.
729	00:44:29	00:44:32	There were two other people in the car.
730	00:44:32	00:44:35	That's what I meant, you know?
731	00:44:35	00:44:37	I thought we were all going to die.
732	00:44:38	00:44:40	Search and Rescue found Eddie's body 100 yards downstream.
733	00:44:40	00:44:45	See, that's where it gets a little less heroic-- we found Lindsey alone in a sinking car.
734	00:44:45	00:44:47	I tried to get Eddie out.
735	00:44:47	00:44:51	He was unconscious, and that... that kid kept screaming.
736	00:44:51	00:44:54	The current was really strong and we got swept downstream.
737	00:44:54	00:44:56	What was I supposed to do?
738	00:44:56	00:45:01	Get to a phone, call the cops, call an ambulance, anything, actually, other than what you did.
739	00:45:01	00:45:02	I am just one person.
740	00:45:02	00:45:06	Eddie is my priority, not that...
741	00:45:06	00:45:09	that stupid, screaming little brat.
742	00:45:11	00:45:12	I tried, I...
743	00:45:12	00:45:14	You even think about my daughter again, I'll kill you.
744	00:45:14	00:45:15	I will kill you.
745	00:45:15	00:45:17	I will hunt you down and put...
746	00:45:17	00:45:18	I will put you in the ground! Catherine.
747	00:45:18	00:45:19	You saw that.
748	00:45:19	00:45:21	She threatened me!
749	00:45:21	00:45:22	I want a lawyer.
750	00:45:22	00:45:24	What the hell are you doing?
751	00:45:24	00:45:27	Do you know where you're at right now?
752	00:45:27	00:45:29	I've been here a lot longer than you...
753	00:45:29	00:45:30	And you should know better.
754	00:45:30	00:45:33	And I wouldn't have to be here if you were doing your job properly.
755	00:45:33	00:45:37	There is a difference between me doing my job and you wanting to do it for me.
756	00:45:37	00:45:39	You don't want to get the job done.
757	00:45:39	00:45:40	What you want, right now, is revenge.
758	00:45:41	00:45:42	You're going to tell me what I want, huh?
759	00:45:42	00:45:44	Go home, Catherine.
760	00:45:44	00:45:45	Be with your daughter.
761	00:45:45	00:45:47	She's the one that needs you.
762	00:45:57	00:45:59	What did you consider this?
763	00:45:59	00:46:02	A little civility before work, I think?
764	00:46:02	00:46:04	Or a ritual to put us at ease.
765	00:46:04	00:46:09	Or how about In custom and ceremony, are innocence and beauty born.
766	00:46:09	00:46:12	Yeats...
767	00:46:12	00:46:14	Prayer for My Daughter.
768	00:46:14	00:46:16	Or our morning.
769	00:46:16	00:46:17	Cream?
770	00:46:17	00:46:19	Please.
771	00:46:22	00:46:24	Thank you.
772	00:46:24	00:46:25	Sugar?
773	00:46:25	00:46:27	I'm diabetic.
774	00:46:30	00:46:31	Type One?
775	00:46:31	00:46:33	Mm-hmm.
776	00:46:33	00:46:35	Injections.
777	00:46:35	00:46:36	Used to mean injections.
778	00:46:36	00:46:39	I changed to a pressure syringe.
779	00:46:42	00:46:44	Recently?
780	00:46:44	00:46:45	Mm, a few weeks ago.
781	00:46:45	00:46:48	Oh, it's a fascinating instrument; would you like to see it?
782	00:46:50	00:46:51	Yes, I would.
783	00:46:52	00:46:54	But I'm afraid I'll need a warrant.
784	00:46:57	00:46:59	Excuse me.
785	00:47:07	00:47:08	It's Grissom.
786	00:47:08	00:47:15	I need you to write paper on Lady Heather's medical paraphernalia-- specifically, an insulin kit and syringes.
787	00:47:17	00:47:18	I'm already there.
788	00:47:18	00:47:20	I'll wait.
789	00:47:25	00:47:28	I think I just heard you say stop.
790	00:47:30	00:47:32	You lied to us, Mrs. McCormick.
791	00:47:32	00:47:37	You said you only engaged in on-line sex with Trey Buchman.
792	00:47:38	00:47:42	Your hair has a similar morphology to the hair that we found in Mr. Buchman's hotel suite.
793	00:47:43	00:47:46	Well, similar doesn't mean me.
794	00:47:46	00:47:50	No, but the DNA we also recovered from under the sheets does mean you.
795	00:47:51	00:47:53	Sounds like a physical encounter to me.
796	00:47:56	00:47:59	So, since I pay for sex, I must also be a murderer?
797	00:47:59	00:48:03	No, it's just that everybody you pay for sex ends up dead.
798	00:48:03	00:48:05	I don't like you.
799	00:48:05	00:48:08	Well, I guess I'll have to live with that.
800	00:48:09	00:48:13	Here's something else you might not like.
801	00:48:13	00:48:17	Two months ago, your bank records show cash withdrawals totaling $50,000.
802	00:48:17	00:48:21	The same amount that we found in Croix Richards' apartment.
803	00:48:21	00:48:24	Croix wasn't even half that good.
804	00:48:24	00:48:26	Of course, that's still better than my husband.
805	00:48:30	00:48:32	You used to work for Latona Pharmaceuticals, right?
806	00:48:32	00:48:34	Years ago.
807	00:48:34	00:48:36	You sold synthetic insulin.
808	00:48:36	00:48:40	All right. Mm-hmm.
809	00:48:40	00:48:44	We've had our fun, but I'm stopping it now.
810	00:48:44	00:48:47	Any other questions you have can be directed to my lawyer.
811	00:48:49	00:48:54	Well, modern recording's all digital so each track's recorded in a separate data file.
812	00:48:54	00:49:00	By looking at the file modification times, we can approximate which tracks were recorded near the time of the shooting.
813	00:49:00	00:49:01	30 p.m.
814	00:49:01	00:49:03	55.
815	00:49:06	00:49:07	Let's see, well...
816	00:49:07	00:49:11	only two tracks were laid down during that time interval.
817	00:49:11	00:49:17	41 38 Let's look at the drum track.
818	00:49:19	00:49:22	There's the kit drum.
819	00:49:22	00:49:25	So any irregularity in the pattern could be from an outside source.
820	00:49:25	00:49:26	Yeah.
821	00:49:26	00:49:27	Right here.
822	00:49:28	00:49:30	A sudden change in amplitude.
823	00:49:30	00:49:32	Can you isolate it?
824	00:49:32	00:49:34	Yeah.
825	00:49:38	00:49:40	Sounds like gunfire.
826	00:49:40	00:49:41	I'll play it again.
827	00:49:47	00:49:50	Let me take out the drums.
828	00:49:59	00:50:00	What is that?
829	00:50:00	00:50:03	Feels like an engine.
830	00:50:03	00:50:04	V-twin, maybe.
831	00:50:04	00:50:06	Must have been somebody else there.
832	00:50:06	00:50:08	You think we got a witness?
833	00:50:08	00:50:09	Or a suspect.
834	00:50:09	00:50:10	Hey...
835	00:50:10	00:50:12	I was able to pull the phone records for Candeece.
836	00:50:12	00:50:13	She made six calls that night.
837	00:50:13	00:50:14	The first five went to Eddie.
838	00:50:15	00:50:16	But not the last one.
839	00:50:16	00:50:17	You got an address?
840	00:50:17	00:50:19	I get all kind of calls.
841	00:50:19	00:50:21	It could've been a girl that I slept with.
842	00:50:21	00:50:23	Or a girl that I didn't sleep with.
843	00:50:23	00:50:24	Could've been a wrong number.
844	00:50:24	00:50:26	Since when do wrong numbers last for four minutes?
845	00:50:26	00:50:29	You hear a sexy voice on the phone, what are you gonna do, you gonna hang up?
846	00:50:30	00:50:31	So you do remember the call.
847	00:50:31	00:50:33	I like your Harley.
848	00:50:35	00:50:38	Look, Kiner, you're on parole; you got no rights.
849	00:50:38	00:50:39	Looking at two strikes.
850	00:50:39	00:50:43	I'm not trying to pull a fast ball on you, but it's not the first time you've talked to Candeece.
851	00:50:43	00:50:44	So maybe me and Candy are friends.
852	00:50:44	00:50:46	Were friends.
853	00:50:46	00:50:48	You guys used to talk once a day.
854	00:50:48	00:50:50	Then she stopped calling you, until last night.
855	00:50:51	00:50:52	People change.
856	00:50:52	00:50:56	Fell into a bad element.
857	00:50:56	00:50:59	Mr. Kiner, do you own this house?
858	00:50:59	00:51:01	My father left it to me.
859	00:51:01	00:51:02	Your father have a drug problem?
860	00:51:03	00:51:05	We found GHB in your garage.
861	00:51:05	00:51:06	Georgia Home Boy.
862	00:51:06	00:51:07	Tell us what happened with Eddie.
863	00:51:08	00:51:10	Candy needed help.
864	00:51:11	00:51:12	Hey, hey, hey!
865	00:51:12	00:51:13	What are you doing here?
866	00:51:13	00:51:15	What are you selling her drugs for?
867	00:51:15	00:51:16	What are you doing?
868	00:51:16	00:51:17	I wanted you clean.
869	00:51:17	00:51:18	Hey, please...
870	00:51:18	00:51:19	What do you want, huh?
871	00:51:19	00:51:20	This what you want?
872	00:51:21	00:51:22	I got on my hog.
873	00:51:22	00:51:23	I got the hell out of there.
874	00:51:24	00:51:25	What do you expect me to do?
875	00:51:25	00:51:26	Go back to the joint for her?
876	00:51:30	00:51:32	Cuff him.
877	00:51:35	00:51:36	Quid pro quo, right?
878	00:51:36	00:51:42	Steven invests in your business, you kill the two guys who are messing around with his wife.
879	00:51:42	00:51:44	I could help you, Mr. Brass...
880	00:51:44	00:51:45	with your inadequacy.
881	00:51:45	00:51:48	You know, I'd like that, Lady H.
882	00:51:48	00:51:50	It's tough being me.
883	00:51:52	00:51:57	I'd like to feel more secure in my role as a homicide detective.
884	00:51:58	00:52:00	You know what really gets me wild?
885	00:52:00	00:52:02	The truth.
886	00:52:02	00:52:04	Are you up for that?
887	00:52:06	00:52:10	Mr. Grissom collected samples of my insulin.
888	00:52:10	00:52:14	He's undoubtedly identified it as non-synthetic.
889	00:52:14	00:52:15	He told me it was beef insulin.
890	00:52:15	00:52:18	Which, I take it, matches the insulin found in the two victims.
891	00:52:18	00:52:24	Do you know that only seven percent of diabetics in this country use an animal-based insulin?
892	00:52:24	00:52:26	They import yours from Great Britain.
893	00:52:26	00:52:28	Which narrows the field down even further.
894	00:52:28	00:52:29	Right into your dominion.
895	00:52:30	00:52:31	My personal area is open.
896	00:52:31	00:52:35	Anyone could've walked right in and stolen from me.
897	00:52:37	00:52:38	Is it something I said?
898	00:52:41	00:52:44	I'm disappointed in you.
899	00:52:45	00:52:49	But not surprised.
900	00:52:49	00:52:50	You fear me...
901	00:52:51	00:52:54	because I've committed the one unforgivable act.
902	00:52:54	00:52:56	No, it's more like two acts...
903	00:52:56	00:52:58	of murder.
904	00:53:01	00:53:03	I know you.
905	00:53:03	00:53:07	And I know that in your heart, you don't believe I did this.
906	00:53:07	00:53:09	Lady Heather...
907	00:53:09	00:53:11	this has nothing to do with heart.
908	00:53:11	00:53:12	It's all about the evidence.
909	00:54:11	00:54:12	Greg...
910	00:54:13	00:54:15	I need you to process these right away.
911	00:54:15	00:54:17	Priority.
912	00:54:17	00:54:18	Grissom!
913	00:54:18	00:54:20	We got a problem.
914	00:54:29	00:54:31	Stranglings are intimate.
915	00:54:32	00:54:33	Crime of passion.
916	00:54:39	00:54:41	Or not.
917	00:55:00	00:55:01	Mr. McCormick...
918	00:55:01	00:55:04	were you the one who found your wife?
919	00:55:04	00:55:06	Yes.
920	00:55:06	00:55:08	On the stairs?
921	00:55:08	00:55:11	Yes.
922	00:55:11	00:55:13	May I see your hands, please?
923	00:55:22	00:55:24	Other side.
924	00:55:31	00:55:33	They look clean.
925	00:55:33	00:55:35	Mm.
926	00:55:35	00:55:38	Should they be?
927	00:55:42	00:55:43	I don't know.
928	00:55:44	00:55:47	If it were my spouse, I would've touched the body.
929	00:55:47	00:55:50	Mm. I didn't.
930	00:56:04	00:56:06	Kiner is a drug dealer.
931	00:56:06	00:56:08	Your drug dealer.
932	00:56:08	00:56:09	No. Not anymore.
933	00:56:09	00:56:11	Eddie got me off all that stuff.
934	00:56:11	00:56:12	You called Kiner.
935	00:56:12	00:56:13	He came here.
936	00:56:13	00:56:14	I tried to call Eddie.
937	00:56:15	00:56:16	He had his phone off.
938	00:56:16	00:56:19	He was with his pain-in-the-ass daughter and that psycho ex-wife of his.
939	00:56:20	00:56:24	I was just alone in front of a microphone with my whole career riding on a demo.
940	00:56:24	00:56:26	It's none of your business.
941	00:56:26	00:56:27	Hey, Eddie.
942	00:56:27	00:56:28	What? ( gunshot )
943	00:56:28	00:56:30	( grunts ) Oh, my God!
944	00:56:30	00:56:32	I thought Eddie wasn't coming.
945	00:56:32	00:56:36	I guess he was just late.
946	00:56:41	00:56:48	The material we found in Rebecca McCormick's wound was nylon thread with fragments of ostrich feather.
947	00:56:48	00:56:49	Oh, I know that look.
948	00:56:49	00:56:50	We're going back to Lady Heather's.
949	00:56:50	00:56:52	I can take care of this myself.
950	00:56:52	00:56:53	Gil, do me a favor. Get a sports car.
951	00:56:53	00:56:56	It's a lot cheaper and easier to handle.
952	00:57:00	00:57:02	I'd like to come in.
953	00:57:02	00:57:04	Of course you would.
954	00:57:04	00:57:05	Say the magic word.
955	00:57:05	00:57:08	Warrant?
956	00:57:08	00:57:09	We don't have one.
957	00:57:09	00:57:15	The, uh, submissive that was in here yesterday was wearing a feather boa.
958	00:57:15	00:57:16	That would be Chloe.
959	00:57:17	00:57:18	Chloe, uh...?
960	00:57:18	00:57:20	Chloe Samms.
961	00:57:20	00:57:26	She uses it as a garrote-- a way to control her breathing to heighten the experience for the dominant client.
962	00:57:26	00:57:28	Hmm.
963	00:57:43	00:57:46	Same scent as Trey Buchman's crime scene.
964	00:57:46	00:57:50	Remember the strawberry foam?
965	00:57:50	00:57:52	Do these belong to Chloe?
966	00:57:52	00:57:54	I believe so.
967	00:57:54	00:57:57	Well, the shoes link Chloe to the nightclub and this job links Chloe to the two vics.
968	00:57:57	00:57:58	Where is she?
969	00:57:58	00:57:59	She quit yesterday.
970	00:57:59	00:58:01	I bet I know why.
971	00:58:01	00:58:03	Well, if she's in town, I'll find her.
972	00:58:09	00:58:11	I owe you an apology.
973	00:58:11	00:58:14	Apologies are just words.
974	00:58:23	00:58:25	So you're calling it?
975	00:58:31	00:58:33	I got two liars and no murder weapon...
976	00:58:33	00:58:35	and no choice.
977	00:58:35	00:58:41	I'm going to nail the singer on child endangerment, and fleeing the scene, and the dealer goes up on possession for sale.
978	00:58:47	00:58:50	What a great bedtime story for my little girl.
979	00:58:50	00:58:54	Cat, I did my best.
980	00:58:58	00:59:01	No-needle syringe used on the vic at the foam party.
981	00:59:01	00:59:07	I recovered some epithelials from the plunger end, compared them to your reference sample.
982	00:59:11	00:59:14	That girl you have in custody, it's her DNA.
983	00:59:15	00:59:17	Case closed.
984	00:59:18	00:59:19	Thank you, Greg.
985	00:59:34	00:59:36	Look familiar?
986	00:59:39	00:59:44	Insulin was injected into Trey Buchman's shoulder at this end...
987	00:59:44	00:59:46	by you.
988	00:59:52	00:59:56	Your epithelials were found at the plunger end.
989	00:59:56	01:00:04	Epithelials are skin cells filled with DNA-- your genetic fingerprint.
990	01:00:04	01:00:09	So, you're going to tell us why and you're going to tell us why you strangled Rebecca McCormick.
991	01:00:10	01:00:14	For Steven.
992	01:00:16	01:00:18	I belong to him.
993	01:00:18	01:00:24	Chloe had a problem controlling her emotions.
994	01:00:24	01:00:26	She let things get personal.
995	01:00:26	01:00:28	Define personal, in your crowd.
996	01:00:28	01:00:29	In my crowd?
997	01:00:29	01:00:30	Yeah.
998	01:00:37	01:00:41	So you started seeing each other outside of Lady Heather's?
999	01:00:42	01:00:43	We'd meet occasionally, yes.
1000	01:00:43	01:00:45	Listen...
1001	01:00:45	01:00:47	my wife had a problem with sex.
1002	01:00:47	01:00:50	Sounds like she had a problem with you, pal.
1003	01:00:50	01:00:52	My wife had a problem with sex.
1004	01:00:52	01:00:55	And at Lady Heather's, I fixed her.
1005	01:00:55	01:00:56	Oh, you fixed her?
1006	01:00:56	01:00:58	Yes.
1007	01:00:58	01:00:59	She stay fixed?
1008	01:00:59	01:01:04	Yeah, you fixed her so good that she started spending your money to get other men to give her what you couldn't.
1009	01:01:04	01:01:05	Rebecca was out of control.
1010	01:01:05	01:01:07	So you got her to kill Richards and Buchman.
1011	01:01:07	01:01:08	No, I didn't.
1012	01:01:08	01:01:11	And then you told her to kill your wife. No, I loved my wife.
1013	01:01:11	01:01:12	I didn't tell Chloe to do anything.
1014	01:01:12	01:01:16	What happened? She killed Richards and Buchman on her own.
1015	01:01:16	01:01:20	Okay.
1016	01:01:24	01:01:27	Chloe thought that killing your wife's lovers would please you.
1017	01:01:29	01:01:31	And it did please you.
1018	01:01:31	01:01:33	I told her to stop.
1019	01:01:33	01:01:35	But she didn't obey you.
1020	01:01:35	01:01:37	She killed your wife.
1021	01:01:39	01:01:42	You couldn't make Chloe do what you wanted.
1022	01:01:42	01:01:48	All that time at Lady Heather's and you never learned that the submissive is the one in control?
1023	01:01:51	01:01:54	I told her to stop.
