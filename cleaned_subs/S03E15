0,00:00:12,00:00:13,Turn around.
1,00:00:16,00:00:17,Go ahead.
2,00:00:17,00:00:18,Next.
3,00:00:28,00:00:30,(beeping)
4,00:00:31,00:00:33,My kitty's pierced.
5,00:00:34,00:00:35,Want to see?
6,00:00:52,00:00:54,"DJ: Angels, devils..."
7,00:00:54,00:01:00,"virgins and sinners, let the foam take you away to your deepest desires."
8,00:01:00,00:01:03,Cleanse yourself.
9,00:01:03,00:01:05,There's no turning back now.
10,00:01:32,00:01:34,(screaming)
11,00:01:48,00:01:50,Ever been to a foam party?
12,00:01:50,00:01:51,What do you think?
13,00:01:51,00:01:54,Things can get pretty wild.
14,00:01:54,00:01:57,Evidently.
15,00:01:57,00:01:58,You got an I.D. on this guy?
16,00:01:58,00:02:00,"Yeah, the deceased is Trey Buchman."
17,00:02:00,00:02:02,Age 21. I got a Vegas I.D.
18,00:02:02,00:02:03,Eyewitnesses?
19,00:02:03,00:02:06,"Uh, too much foam."
20,00:02:06,00:02:07,The party was over.
21,00:02:07,00:02:09,Most of the responsible young adults had split.
22,00:02:09,00:02:11,It's amazing how the sight of blood can clear a room.
23,00:02:11,00:02:12,Yeah. I'll tell you what we got.
24,00:02:12,00:02:16,"My guys are talking with the girl who found the body, but even sober, she's not going to be much help."
25,00:02:17,00:02:18,Wonder what made this wound?
26,00:02:18,00:02:20,Looks like a puncture.
27,00:02:20,00:02:22,"Ice pick, maybe?"
28,00:02:23,00:02:25,"Well, wow, tell you it's not for the money."
29,00:02:26,00:02:29,"I got about three grand here, all in C-notes."
30,00:02:29,00:02:31,Proves the old adage.
31,00:02:31,00:02:32,Which adage is that?
32,00:02:32,00:02:34,You can't take it with you.
33,00:03:08,00:03:11,BROWN: Foam at the Sinner's Den.
34,00:03:11,00:03:12,I hung out here a few times.
35,00:03:12,00:03:13,Never been.
36,00:03:14,00:03:16,Your knucklehead boyfriend never took you on the party circuit?
37,00:03:16,00:03:17,"Uh, pass."
38,00:03:17,00:03:19,That's cool about Vegas.
39,00:03:19,00:03:27,"It's Monday: Rain at the Palms, Tuesday: EDEN at Studio 54, Wednesday: RAW at the Luxor, Thursday's Baby's..."
40,00:03:27,00:03:30,"Hey, look. Some kid dropped dead."
41,00:03:30,00:03:31,It's a shame.
42,00:03:31,00:03:33,Kids OD all the time in nightclubs.
43,00:03:33,00:03:34,They're big boys and girls. This ain't church.
44,00:03:34,00:03:36,I understand that.
45,00:03:36,00:03:40,"You understand. You know the kind of rent I pay on a joint like this? Rain or shine, I owe the landlord $50,000."
46,00:03:40,00:03:41,"You're breaking my heart, pal."
47,00:03:41,00:03:43,"Look, here's how this works."
48,00:03:43,00:03:45,The more you cooperate the sooner you'll be up and running.
49,00:03:45,00:03:47,"You don't get it. No, I get it."
50,00:03:47,00:03:49,"I got a daughter who's 20, she hangs out."
51,00:03:49,00:03:54,"I don't want her to die in a place like this, so do me a favor, get me the VIP list for tonight."
52,00:03:54,00:03:56,And smarten up.
53,00:04:08,00:04:11,There's seminal fluid all over the place.
54,00:04:11,00:04:13,Is this a dance club or a sex club?
55,00:04:13,00:04:15,It's a little of both.
56,00:04:15,00:04:17,Don't you love this town?
57,00:04:17,00:04:19,"Whatever you say, Superfly."
58,00:04:21,00:04:24,(sniffing)
59,00:04:26,00:04:28,You guys smell that?
60,00:04:28,00:04:29,Mm-hmm.
61,00:04:30,00:04:31,Smells like strawberries.
62,00:04:31,00:04:33,It's the foam.
63,00:04:33,00:04:35,Reminds me of the Mirage.
64,00:04:35,00:04:41,"Steve Wynn didn't like the smell of the volcano erupting, so he changed the fuel mixture."
65,00:04:41,00:04:43,Now it smells like a piña colada.
66,00:04:46,00:04:47,Hey.
67,00:04:47,00:04:49,BRASS: I got a line on our vic.
68,00:04:49,00:04:52,"Trey Buchman, booked a room at the Sphere."
69,00:04:52,00:04:54,"E-Wing, room 937."
70,00:05:06,00:05:08,These people are freaks.
71,00:05:10,00:05:12,Got a long dark hair.
72,00:05:15,00:05:16,Vic had short hair.
73,00:05:19,00:05:22,One of our freaks wears pussycat pink.
74,00:05:22,00:05:24,WOMAN: The battle was fierce.
75,00:05:24,00:05:30,"The evil sorceress had powerful magic, but the prince was brave and true."
76,00:05:32,00:05:41,"Finally, the brave prince slew the sorceress-dragon and went to awaken his beloved princess."
77,00:05:41,00:05:42,"You're late, Eddie."
78,00:05:43,00:05:44,Don't start.
79,00:05:44,00:05:46,He climbed the many stairs to the top...
80,00:05:46,00:05:49,WILLOWS: You know how much this meant to Lindsey?
81,00:05:49,00:05:51,"Can we argue about this later, okay?"
82,00:05:53,00:05:56,Her eyes would open with true love's kiss.
83,00:05:56,00:05:58,She's so beautiful.
84,00:05:58,00:05:59,Give me that.
85,00:06:04,00:06:06,Nice perfume.
86,00:06:06,00:06:08,(sighing)
87,00:06:09,00:06:11,My...
88,00:06:11,00:06:12,Okay.
89,00:06:12,00:06:13,Fine.
90,00:06:14,00:06:15,Is this okay?
91,00:06:15,00:06:16,WOMAN: My prince...
92,00:06:17,00:06:18,(loud clanking)
93,00:06:21,00:06:23,WOMAN: My prince...
94,00:06:23,00:06:24,"at long last, you've come for me."
95,00:06:24,00:06:26,My...
96,00:06:27,00:06:29,"My, my prince..."
97,00:06:29,00:06:34,"WOMAN: At long last, you've come for me."
98,00:06:43,00:06:45,"I'm sorry, baby. You did good, though."
99,00:06:45,00:06:48,"Yeah, you were fine, Linds. Great."
100,00:06:48,00:06:50,"Hey, and you know what?"
101,00:06:50,00:06:53,It's just a play.
102,00:06:53,00:06:54,"No, it's not just a play."
103,00:06:54,00:06:57,I was Sleeping Beauty and you guys ruined it.
104,00:06:57,00:06:58,"I'm sorry, honey."
105,00:06:58,00:07:03,"Hey, I'll bet if you ask Mrs. Parker, she'd let you keep that blue dress."
106,00:07:03,00:07:05,I want to go home.
107,00:07:05,00:07:06,Okay.
108,00:07:06,00:07:08,Let's go home.
109,00:07:08,00:07:09,"No, Mom."
110,00:07:09,00:07:11,I want to go with Dad.
111,00:07:12,00:07:14,You sure about that?
112,00:07:16,00:07:17,Okay.
113,00:07:19,00:07:23,Tox report on your foam guy came back negative.
114,00:07:24,00:07:25,Negative?
115,00:07:25,00:07:29,"No drugs, no alcohol, no medication, not even an aspirin."
116,00:07:29,00:07:30,That's odd.
117,00:07:30,00:07:32,It was a den of iniquity.
118,00:07:33,00:07:35,What about the neck wound?
119,00:07:35,00:07:39,The sternocleidomastoid muscle and the jugular vein were lacerated.
120,00:07:42,00:07:44,"The wound was a bloody mess, probably lethal."
121,00:07:44,00:07:46,Any idea what caused it?
122,00:07:46,00:07:47,Hard to say.
123,00:07:47,00:07:49,Definitely an odd entry wound.
124,00:07:49,00:07:51,Not a knife or sharp object.
125,00:07:51,00:07:54,"Probably something blunt, like a pen or a stake of some sort."
126,00:07:54,00:07:55,Anything else?
127,00:07:55,00:07:57,Check this out.
128,00:08:00,00:08:01,Looks like a bite.
129,00:08:01,00:08:04,"Spider bite or allergic reaction, maybe?"
130,00:08:04,00:08:05,Stand by.
131,00:08:05,00:08:09,"I'll process the tissue in histopath, see if it's worth writing home about."
132,00:08:14,00:08:17,BROWN: I was wondering where I put my nice silver satin thong.
133,00:08:17,00:08:19,Gloves.
134,00:08:22,00:08:29,"Okay, we're looking for any kind of blunt object that could've been used to stab our victim in the neck."
135,00:08:33,00:08:35,Glow stick.
136,00:08:37,00:08:38,Ball-point pen.
137,00:08:40,00:08:41,Cell phone antenna.
138,00:08:43,00:08:44,You have the Luminol?
139,00:08:46,00:08:48,Thank you.
140,00:08:58,00:08:59,Nothing.
141,00:09:04,00:09:05,Are we sure it was a blunt object?
142,00:09:14,00:09:16,"Size ten, double A."
143,00:09:16,00:09:18,"Stilettos, huh?"
144,00:09:18,00:09:21,"Brings out the toes, accentuates the legs."
145,00:09:21,00:09:23,"Murder on the ankles, though."
146,00:09:29,00:09:32,Looks like murder to me.
147,00:09:35,00:09:40,"WOMAN: Sinner's Den, SRO, I'm on every club's VIP list."
148,00:09:40,00:09:41,"Well, you got lucky."
149,00:09:41,00:09:42,You're on my list now.
150,00:09:42,00:09:44,I don't want to be on your list.
151,00:09:44,00:09:45,"Here, hold this. (scoffs)"
152,00:09:45,00:09:47,Nice shoes.
153,00:09:47,00:09:48,Thank you.
154,00:09:48,00:09:49,"GRISSOM: Okay, this is the story."
155,00:09:50,00:09:54,One of you lovely Cinderellas is missing a glass slipper and I'm playing the prince.
156,00:09:54,00:09:58,"So would each of you remove your right shoe, please?"
157,00:10:01,00:10:03,Doesn't fit.
158,00:10:11,00:10:12,Almost.
159,00:10:16,00:10:18,Hi.
160,00:10:22,00:10:24,No.
161,00:10:33,00:10:36,"Well, if the shoe fits..."
162,00:10:36,00:10:37,Wear it.
163,00:10:40,00:10:43,(thunder rumbling)
164,00:10:43,00:10:45,Comfortable?
165,00:10:45,00:10:46,So far.
166,00:10:46,00:10:48,Thanks for asking.
167,00:10:49,00:10:52,You want to tell me how your shoe ended up in Trey Buchman's neck?
168,00:10:56,00:10:58,I don't know.
169,00:10:58,00:11:03,"Last I remember, the foam was rising..."
170,00:11:03,00:11:09,and my heel went into something... soft.
171,00:11:10,00:11:12,Thought it was someone's foot.
172,00:11:13,00:11:14,Jugular.
173,00:11:14,00:11:15,There's a slight difference.
174,00:11:15,00:11:18,Do you want to tell me why you left your shoe behind?
175,00:11:18,00:11:20,Heel broke.
176,00:11:20,00:11:22,"And the fact it had blood on it, that wasn't the reason?"
177,00:11:22,00:11:24,Never saw blood.
178,00:11:24,00:11:25,I see.
179,00:11:25,00:11:32,I did some checking-- because that's what I do-- and you and our victim had a relationship a while back.
180,00:11:32,00:11:40,"I've ""relationshipped"" about a dozen guys on the circuit, including Trey."
181,00:11:40,00:11:43,Nothing ends-- we still all meet up at the club.
182,00:11:43,00:11:44,I see.
183,00:11:54,00:12:04,"And the way he gave it to me, believe me, he's the last guy I'd want dead."
184,00:12:06,00:12:08,(clears throat)
185,00:12:08,00:12:09,"GRISSOM: Excuse me, Jim."
186,00:12:09,00:12:10,Am I interrupting something?
187,00:12:10,00:12:12,"Gil, please."
188,00:12:15,00:12:17,Miss... (donning rubber gloves)
189,00:12:17,00:12:19,I'm going to need a sample of your DNA.
190,00:12:19,00:12:21,How do you want it?
191,00:12:21,00:12:23,I like your hair.
192,00:12:23,00:12:25,I like yours.
193,00:12:26,00:12:27,"Are you a, uh, natural blonde?"
194,00:12:35,00:12:36,Ow.
195,00:12:36,00:12:37,Sorry.
196,00:12:37,00:12:40,I needed a follicular tag.
197,00:12:40,00:12:41,(envelope rustles)
198,00:12:41,00:12:42,Thank you.
199,00:12:43,00:12:45,Gil?
200,00:12:46,00:12:48,Any chance you found my thong?
201,00:12:48,00:12:52,"Silver lamÃ©, probably twisted in knots."
202,00:12:52,00:12:53,"Oh, yeah, we did."
203,00:12:53,00:12:55,"You'll need to fill out a form, though."
204,00:12:55,00:12:56,The captain will help you.
205,00:12:56,00:12:58,Surely.
206,00:13:36,00:13:40,(opera playing over headphones)
207,00:13:47,00:13:49,"Hey, Gil?"
208,00:13:49,00:13:51,(opera music continues)
209,00:13:51,00:13:53,Carmen?
210,00:13:56,00:13:57,(music playing loudly)
211,00:13:57,00:13:59,Right after the murder.
212,00:13:59,00:14:01,Opera makes it all seem so lovely.
213,00:14:01,00:14:06,"And at the risk of sounding like your mother, you're to ruin your eardrums."
214,00:14:06,00:14:07,(turns music off)
215,00:14:07,00:14:10,Our victim's tissue-- Trey Buchman.
216,00:14:10,00:14:16,"The, uh, circular contusions I sectioned, indicate damage extending only 30 microns below the epidermis."
217,00:14:16,00:14:19,So it's not a bug bite.
218,00:14:19,00:14:21,"Man-made, high-pressure, subcutaneous injector."
219,00:14:21,00:14:22,No needle?
220,00:14:22,00:14:25,Simply high pressure penetrating the skin.
221,00:14:31,00:14:32,Did you send a sample to tox?
222,00:14:32,00:14:35,Our victim was injected with insulin.
223,00:14:35,00:14:37,Diabetic?
224,00:14:37,00:14:38,Nope.
225,00:14:38,00:14:40,So cause of death was insulin shock.
226,00:14:41,00:14:48,Insulin doesn't make for a narcotic or hallucinogenic high so I don't know why Buchman would take the stuff.
227,00:14:48,00:14:50,STOKES: Downstairs neighbor smelled it.
228,00:14:50,00:14:52,Called the plumber.
229,00:14:52,00:14:54,"Yeah, they always think it's a sewage problem."
230,00:14:54,00:14:56,(cell phone ringing) Phew!
231,00:14:57,00:14:59,Eddie?
232,00:15:00,00:15:02,Ed? Hello?
233,00:15:02,00:15:03,"Uh... bad connection, Ed."
234,00:15:04,00:15:06,"Uh, I just entered a scene."
235,00:15:06,00:15:07,I-I'll call you later.
236,00:15:07,00:15:09,Whew.
237,00:15:09,00:15:12,"No pain, no gain."
238,00:15:12,00:15:14,Purge fluid.
239,00:15:14,00:15:16,D.U.N.S.
240,00:15:19,00:15:20,Dead Upstairs Neighbor Syndrome.
241,00:15:21,00:15:25,"Mm-hmm. Yeah, well, it's going to take us a while to get this smell out of our nose hairs."
242,00:15:25,00:15:27,Parchment changes of the skin.
243,00:15:27,00:15:30,"So what's the exposure to that window, south?"
244,00:15:30,00:15:31,East.
245,00:15:31,00:15:33,Gets direct sunlight half the day.
246,00:15:33,00:15:34,I learned that down in Lauderdale.
247,00:15:34,00:15:36,"You know, you've got to remember to turn."
248,00:15:36,00:15:39,"Right, all that spring break activity with your frat brothers."
249,00:15:39,00:15:41,"Well, something like that."
250,00:15:41,00:15:44,Nice little cocaine fingernail.
251,00:15:44,00:15:47,So... no mail built up.
252,00:15:47,00:15:50,I don't see a telephone.
253,00:15:50,00:15:53,What do you think? (cell phone ringing)
254,00:15:53,00:15:54,Howard Hughes in a studio apartment?
255,00:15:55,00:15:57,Eddie?
256,00:15:57,00:15:58,Ed?
257,00:15:58,00:16:00,Now what's his deal?
258,00:16:00,00:16:02,Lindsey's with him.
259,00:16:02,00:16:04,Maybe she's ready to come home.
260,00:16:04,00:16:05,"Yeah, I bet."
261,00:16:35,00:16:38,How you doing?
262,00:16:38,00:16:41,Cash and a very busy passport.
263,00:16:44,00:16:45,Designer threads.
264,00:16:45,00:16:48,"Ten-to-one, Croix Richards is a drug dealer."
265,00:16:48,00:16:50,And that is no workout accident.
266,00:16:52,00:16:55,(cell phone ringing)
267,00:16:56,00:16:59,Eddie?
268,00:16:59,00:17:01,"Eddie, you've got to get to a land line."
269,00:17:01,00:17:02,This connection sucks.
270,00:17:02,00:17:04,LINDSEY: Mommy... (static)
271,00:17:04,00:17:06,Lindsey?
272,00:17:06,00:17:09,"H-Honey, I-I can't hear you."
273,00:17:09,00:17:12,Mommy... please... scared... all alone. (crying)
274,00:17:12,00:17:13,You're alone?
275,00:17:13,00:17:15,"Well, honey, where's Daddy?"
276,00:17:15,00:17:17,Daddy... (static)
277,00:17:17,00:17:18,You want me to just...? Uh...
278,00:17:18,00:17:20,"Thanks-- uh, yeah, honey."
279,00:17:20,00:17:22,"Yes, yes, I'm coming."
280,00:17:22,00:17:23,"Mommy, please!"
281,00:17:23,00:17:26,I'm scared... all alone!
282,00:17:26,00:17:29,"We were in the car, going fast."
283,00:17:29,00:17:30,We hit something.
284,00:17:30,00:17:32,"It's going to be okay, honey."
285,00:17:32,00:17:33,I'm on my way.
286,00:17:33,00:17:35,I just need to know where you are.
287,00:17:35,00:17:36,I don't know.
288,00:17:36,00:17:37,There's lots of water.
289,00:17:37,00:17:38,Are you near a lake?
290,00:17:38,00:17:40,Are you near Grandma's house?
291,00:17:40,00:17:43,"No, the water's in the car."
292,00:17:44,00:17:45,In the car?
293,00:17:45,00:17:47,"Lindsey, can you get out?"
294,00:17:47,00:17:49,No.
295,00:17:49,00:17:52,"It's going to be okay, honey."
296,00:17:52,00:17:54,Just listen to me.
297,00:17:54,00:17:57,"Before the car crashed, where were you going?"
298,00:17:57,00:17:59,Daddy said the hospital.
299,00:17:59,00:18:01,"On the way there, did you see any hotels?"
300,00:18:01,00:18:03,I saw the castle.
301,00:18:03,00:18:04,Excalibur.
302,00:18:04,00:18:06,"Did you see, did you see the pyramid?"
303,00:18:06,00:18:07,Yeah.
304,00:18:08,00:18:09,Industrial Road?
305,00:18:09,00:18:10,"Is that, is that it?"
306,00:18:10,00:18:12,"Lindsey, is it Industrial Road?"
307,00:18:12,00:18:13,There was a bridge.
308,00:18:13,00:18:14,We went through a fence.
309,00:18:14,00:18:17,(static) Lindsey?
310,00:18:41,00:18:42,Lindsey!
311,00:18:42,00:18:43,Lindsey!
312,00:18:43,00:18:44,(crying)
313,00:18:44,00:18:46,"Hang on, honey!"
314,00:19:01,00:19:02,"Mommy! I'm here, honey."
315,00:19:02,00:19:04,Mommy! I'm going to get you out.
316,00:19:04,00:19:05,Hang on.
317,00:19:09,00:19:10,Okay.
318,00:19:10,00:19:13,"Listen. I have to break the window, okay?"
319,00:19:13,00:19:15,You've got to move to the front.
320,00:19:15,00:19:16,"Mommy, I can't!"
321,00:19:16,00:19:17,I can't.
322,00:19:18,00:19:20,"Okay, I'm going to come around, okay?"
323,00:19:20,00:19:21,I'm coming around.
324,00:19:21,00:19:23,"Please, Mommy."
325,00:19:26,00:19:28,Lindsey!
326,00:19:29,00:19:30,I'm going to go down.
327,00:19:30,00:19:32,I'm going to go down.
328,00:19:52,00:19:53,"(gasping, coughing)"
329,00:19:53,00:19:55,You all right? You okay?
330,00:19:55,00:19:56,Mommy. Yes?
331,00:19:56,00:19:58,I got you. Hold on.
332,00:20:05,00:20:09,LINDSEY: The lady who was driving had pink hair.
333,00:20:09,00:20:11,I don't remember her name.
334,00:20:11,00:20:14,"VEGA: But Lindsey, it was your father's car."
335,00:20:14,00:20:16,Why wasn't he driving it?
336,00:20:16,00:20:19,He had a stomachache.
337,00:20:19,00:20:20,(man groaning)
338,00:20:20,00:20:21,Hang on. We'll get to the hospital.
339,00:20:21,00:20:22,I can't make it.
340,00:20:22,00:20:24,(tires screeching)
341,00:20:24,00:20:29,"The lady got out, and then Daddy fell out."
342,00:20:29,00:20:31,He didn't come back.
343,00:20:31,00:20:33,Catherine?
344,00:20:38,00:20:41,Is Eddie the kind of guy that would leave his daughter abandoned in the back of a car?
345,00:20:41,00:20:42,"Never, never, never, no."
346,00:20:43,00:20:44,He loves Lindsey. He'd never do that.
347,00:20:44,00:20:46,Not willingly.
348,00:20:46,00:20:49,(hydraulic lift whirring)
349,00:20:50,00:20:52,"Be careful with my car, boys."
350,00:20:52,00:20:54,Mom?
351,00:20:56,00:20:58,"He's dead, isn't he?"
352,00:21:01,00:21:03,"I don't know, baby. I..."
353,00:21:04,00:21:06,"I'm going to go look for him, though."
354,00:21:06,00:21:08,I'm just going to be right over there.
355,00:21:08,00:21:12,"Okay, that's enough."
356,00:21:12,00:21:14,I want you to stay here with Detective Vega.
357,00:21:14,00:21:17,Okay?
358,00:21:19,00:21:21,How you doing?
359,00:21:21,00:21:23,Want some cocoa or something?
360,00:22:01,00:22:02,Drugs.
361,00:22:02,00:22:06,"Knowing Eddie's taste in women, I'd say that's a good bet."
362,00:22:06,00:22:09,"Hey, Catherine, you want to give me that?"
363,00:22:10,00:22:12,You shouldn't be handling evidence.
364,00:22:12,00:22:13,You're not on the case.
365,00:22:24,00:22:27,Stop it right there.
366,00:22:29,00:22:30,"STOKES: Hey, Doc."
367,00:22:31,00:22:33,Hey.
368,00:22:33,00:22:36,I thought I'd come and get an update on...
369,00:22:36,00:22:38,Stinky here.
370,00:22:38,00:22:39,Whew!
371,00:22:39,00:22:40,"Wow, that's horrible."
372,00:22:40,00:22:47,"I'm generally immune to the stench of a decomp, but, uh, two weeks of decay still tickles the vibrassae of my nasal vestibule."
373,00:22:47,00:22:49,"Yeah, I'll say."
374,00:22:49,00:22:51,"Hey, what's the foreign body lodged in his femur?"
375,00:22:51,00:22:53,Crank up the milliamps.
376,00:22:55,00:22:59,Whiter than bone.
377,00:22:59,00:23:01,Dense like a metal.
378,00:23:01,00:23:04,What exactly are we looking at?
379,00:23:04,00:23:06,Let's find out.
380,00:23:07,00:23:09,Whew!
381,00:23:22,00:23:27,I feel like Androcles pulling the thorn from a lion's paw.
382,00:23:28,00:23:30,Looks like the tip of a needle.
383,00:23:30,00:23:32,It probably broke off when it hit the bone.
384,00:23:36,00:23:38,BRASS: I've started to see into the future.
385,00:23:38,00:23:43,"Thanks to credit card reports, I see that our phone victim booked a room at the Tangiers for tonight."
386,00:23:43,00:23:44,He was staying at the Sphere.
387,00:23:44,00:23:46,Two hotel rooms in one night.
388,00:23:46,00:23:47,He was a busy boy.
389,00:23:55,00:23:58,Hello.
390,00:23:58,00:24:00,Hello.
391,00:24:00,00:24:01,You're late.
392,00:24:01,00:24:03,Not-not that I mind.
393,00:24:03,00:24:06,There's two of you?
394,00:24:06,00:24:09,We work as a team.
395,00:24:09,00:24:11,What's in the kit?
396,00:24:11,00:24:16,"Latex gloves, cotton swabs, specimen jars, other evidence-gathering stuff."
397,00:24:16,00:24:18,Wait a minute.
398,00:24:18,00:24:20,"Uh, what's going on here?"
399,00:24:20,00:24:21,You tell us.
400,00:24:21,00:24:23,"Oh, my God."
401,00:24:23,00:24:25,You guys are cops.
402,00:24:26,00:24:27,"I'm, um..."
403,00:24:27,00:24:29,I'm really embarrassed.
404,00:24:29,00:24:32,I've never done anything like this before.
405,00:24:32,00:24:33,Iswear.
406,00:24:33,00:24:35,This room is registered to Trey Buchman.
407,00:24:35,00:24:37,Who are you?
408,00:24:37,00:24:39,Do we have to do names?
409,00:24:39,00:24:40,Uh-huh.
410,00:24:40,00:24:41,Rebecca McCormick.
411,00:24:41,00:24:47,"Look, I got a number from a guy who was giving out these cards on the Strip."
412,00:24:47,00:24:49,I thought it would be fun.
413,00:24:49,00:24:51,I-I don't know what I was thinking.
414,00:24:51,00:24:54,Am I under arrest?
415,00:24:54,00:24:55,Not yet.
416,00:25:00,00:25:02,(beeping and whirring)
417,00:25:07,00:25:08,Hey.
418,00:25:08,00:25:09,Cracked my D.B.'s laptop.
419,00:25:09,00:25:11,Got his appointment book.
420,00:25:13,00:25:14,Women's names.
421,00:25:14,00:25:16,Hotels.
422,00:25:16,00:25:18,Blocks of time.
423,00:25:18,00:25:22,"You know, Croix had this sweet apartment and this wad of cash."
424,00:25:22,00:25:23,We thought he was selling drugs.
425,00:25:23,00:25:24,He was selling himself.
426,00:25:24,00:25:25,Gigolo.
427,00:25:25,00:25:26,Paid to get laid.
428,00:25:26,00:25:27,So was mine.
429,00:25:27,00:25:29,"Two victims, same profession."
430,00:25:30,00:25:31,Ooh.
431,00:25:31,00:25:33,What about the needle you found in the decomp?
432,00:25:33,00:25:35,The micrometer pegged it as a 30-gauge.
433,00:25:35,00:25:39,Insulin dependents use needles that thin.
434,00:25:39,00:25:40,"Well, the decomp's too severe."
435,00:25:40,00:25:43,We'll never get anything out of tox or the needle.
436,00:25:43,00:25:45,I think we're working the same case.
437,00:25:47,00:25:49,"Well, good thing my gigolo was organized."
438,00:25:49,00:25:53,He used accounting software to keep track of his finances.
439,00:25:53,00:25:54,Employment history?
440,00:26:04,00:26:06,(clears throat)
441,00:26:11,00:26:15,(man screams in distance)
442,00:26:15,00:26:20,"Mr. Grissom, Captain Brass, (screaming continues) so nice to see you again."
443,00:26:20,00:26:22,Good to hear things haven't changed around here.
444,00:26:22,00:26:24,"I see you haven't changed, either."
445,00:26:24,00:26:27,"Trey Buchman, Croix Richards."
446,00:26:27,00:26:30,They're both on my payroll.
447,00:26:30,00:26:31,"Hard workers, quite skilled."
448,00:26:31,00:26:33,They're deceased.
449,00:26:33,00:26:35,They'll be missed.
450,00:26:35,00:26:37,"Last year, you lost Mona Taylor."
451,00:26:37,00:26:39,"Now, two more employees."
452,00:26:39,00:26:40,It's a risky business.
453,00:26:40,00:26:42,Accusation?
454,00:26:42,00:26:43,It's an observation.
455,00:26:43,00:26:49,"BRASS: These guys traded in sex, and I know you don't allow intercourse in your domain."
456,00:26:49,00:26:51,"Now, that is an accusation."
457,00:26:51,00:26:56,"I profit from the theatrics of pleasure, allowing people to play out their fantasies."
458,00:26:56,00:26:59,Trey and Croix were independent contractors.
459,00:26:59,00:27:03,"GRISSOM: Lady Heather, what services did they provide?"
460,00:27:05,00:27:06,WOMAN: Bad little pig boy.
461,00:27:06,00:27:08,"Bad, bad, bad."
462,00:27:08,00:27:11,"...you naughty, bad pig."
463,00:27:11,00:27:12,(whip cracking)
464,00:27:12,00:27:27,"Oinky, sloppy pig."
465,00:27:27,00:27:28,You're right.
466,00:27:28,00:27:29,I deserve to be punished.
467,00:27:29,00:27:30,Mommy says no.
468,00:27:30,00:27:32,"I said, no."
469,00:27:32,00:27:35,WOMAN: Oh...
470,00:27:35,00:27:36,Who needs the belt?
471,00:27:36,00:27:39,HEATHER: Here it comes.
472,00:27:39,00:27:40,WOMAN: Say you're sorry.
473,00:27:40,00:27:42,I'm sorry.
474,00:27:42,00:27:44,(whip cracking)
475,00:27:44,00:27:46,My dominion is also my domain.
476,00:27:46,00:27:48,Ladyheather.com.
477,00:27:48,00:27:52,"So, Buchman and Richards were down here doing Internet porn, huh?"
478,00:27:52,00:27:53,Not porn.
479,00:27:53,00:27:55,Voyeurism in a brave new world.
480,00:27:55,00:27:57,What would Aldous Huxley say?
481,00:27:57,00:28:02,"If his credit card were valid, he could say anything he wanted at $3.95 a minute."
482,00:28:02,00:28:03,Do you like my lipstick?
483,00:28:04,00:28:05,(man groaning)
484,00:28:07,00:28:08,Why?
485,00:28:08,00:28:10,You've been staring at my lips.
486,00:28:10,00:28:11,You have lovely lips.
487,00:28:12,00:28:13,(whip cracking)
488,00:28:14,00:28:16,(whip cracking)
489,00:28:16,00:28:17,And a very successful business.
490,00:28:17,00:28:20,Thanks. Thanks for your time.
491,00:28:23,00:28:26,See you soon.
492,00:28:31,00:28:36,"VEGA: So, after your recital, where did your dad take you?"
493,00:28:36,00:28:37,Leatherbey's.
494,00:28:37,00:28:38,He got me a banana split.
495,00:28:39,00:28:40,I like whipped cream on mine.
496,00:28:40,00:28:42,Did he have anything to drink?
497,00:28:42,00:28:43,"Did he have a beer, a glass of wine?"
498,00:28:43,00:28:45,Just water.
499,00:28:51,00:28:54,"So, it was just the two of you?"
500,00:28:54,00:29:00,"VEGA: This lady you told us about-- the one who was driving, the one with the pink hair-- where did you meet her?"
501,00:29:00,00:29:02,I don't know.
502,00:29:02,00:29:03,"WILLOW: You remember, Lindsey."
503,00:29:03,00:29:04,Just think about it.
504,00:29:09,00:29:14,"I fell asleep in the car, and I woke up when we stopped."
505,00:29:14,00:29:16,Was this at a house?
506,00:29:16,00:29:18,No. It was a building.
507,00:29:18,00:29:21,"SIDLE: Was it an apartment building, maybe, or maybe an office building?"
508,00:29:21,00:29:24,I don't know.
509,00:29:24,00:29:26,Why did you stop there?
510,00:29:34,00:29:38,Daddy said he had a meeting. He told me to stay in the car and keep the doors locked.
511,00:29:38,00:29:40,You mean he left you in the car alone. Catherine...
512,00:29:40,00:29:41,"Mom, Mom, it's okay."
513,00:29:41,00:29:42,I said I could take care of myself.
514,00:29:43,00:29:44,I told him I could stay in the car.
515,00:29:44,00:29:45,Just don't be mad at him.
516,00:29:45,00:29:47,He didn't do anything wrong.
517,00:29:47,00:29:48,"It's okay, Lindsey."
518,00:29:48,00:29:50,Nobody's mad at anybody.
519,00:29:53,00:29:55,Can I talk to you for a second?
520,00:30:04,00:30:07,It's okay.
521,00:30:17,00:30:20,VEGA: This lady was at the building?
522,00:30:20,00:30:23,She was outside in the parking lot.
523,00:30:23,00:30:24,Eddie.
524,00:30:24,00:30:25,Candeece! Baby!
525,00:30:25,00:30:26,"Where were you? What's the matter, honey?"
526,00:30:26,00:30:28,"Sugar, what's the matter with you?"
527,00:30:28,00:30:29,Oh!
528,00:30:29,00:30:34,This lady with the pink hair-- was she your father's girlfriend?
529,00:30:38,00:30:40,I called you a million times!
530,00:30:40,00:30:41,What are you talking about?
531,00:30:41,00:30:42,Why didn't you answer your phone?
532,00:30:43,00:30:44,Maybe.
533,00:30:44,00:30:46,"Well, he was mad at her."
534,00:30:46,00:30:49,"And then they, they were running back to the car."
535,00:30:49,00:30:51,Daddy was holding his stomach.
536,00:30:51,00:30:56,(groaning)
537,00:30:56,00:30:57,"Daddy, what's wrong?"
538,00:30:57,00:30:59,"It's just a stomachache, honey."
539,00:30:59,00:31:00,I'll be fine.
540,00:31:02,00:31:05,(phone ringing)
541,00:31:05,00:31:07,Willows.
542,00:31:07,00:31:09,Yeah.
543,00:31:48,00:31:54,"Catherine, you can't say good-bye in an autopsy room."
544,00:32:23,00:32:25,"Hi, uh..."
545,00:32:25,00:32:26,Croix Richards and Trey Buchman.
546,00:32:26,00:32:29,"Same profession, same employer, same cause of death."
547,00:32:29,00:32:31,Yeah. Insulin poisoning.
548,00:32:31,00:32:33,Not your typical male MO.
549,00:32:33,00:32:35,Lady Heather a suspect?
550,00:32:35,00:32:36,I can't rule anybody out.
551,00:32:37,00:32:41,Catherine... I'm sorry about Eddie and your daughter.
552,00:32:41,00:32:45,"If, if you'd like to take some time off or..."
553,00:32:45,00:32:47,I'm okay.
554,00:32:47,00:32:51,Lindsey's...
555,00:32:51,00:32:53,We're okay.
556,00:32:57,00:32:58,"STOKES: Hey, Catherine."
557,00:32:58,00:32:59,BROWN: Hey.
558,00:32:59,00:33:00,We heard about what happened.
559,00:33:00,00:33:02,I'm so sorry.
560,00:33:02,00:33:06,"Yeah, if you or Lindsey need anything at all..."
561,00:33:06,00:33:08,"Thanks, you guys."
562,00:33:08,00:33:10,Why don't you catch us up.
563,00:33:10,00:33:12,Yeah.
564,00:33:12,00:33:15,STOKES: Credit card transactions for Lady Heather's Web Site.
565,00:33:15,00:33:17,Both our victims worked in the chat room.
566,00:33:17,00:33:20,We cross-referenced their clients.
567,00:33:20,00:33:21,They're all ladies.
568,00:33:21,00:33:24,And looks like both victims died approximately four weeks apart.
569,00:33:25,00:33:27,BROWN: Killers usually don't stray too far from home.
570,00:33:27,00:33:29,Especially for repeat crimes.
571,00:33:29,00:33:32,"Yeah, I'm squeezing the Las Vegas search area."
572,00:33:36,00:33:37,Got a vial full of blue boogers.
573,00:33:37,00:33:39,GHB with food coloring.
574,00:33:39,00:33:40,That's a date rape drug.
575,00:33:40,00:33:41,Not anymore.
576,00:33:41,00:33:44,"You mix it with the right stimulant, like meth, you got a great party drug."
577,00:33:44,00:33:46,SIDLE: Everyone's a chemist.
578,00:33:46,00:33:47,Thanks.
579,00:33:52,00:33:56,"GRISSOM: You know, we found a dark hair in Trey Buchman's hotel room at the Sphere."
580,00:33:58,00:34:00,I'll exclude everyone with light hair.
581,00:34:07,00:34:08,Whoa.
582,00:34:08,00:34:09,Stop.
583,00:34:09,00:34:10,Huh.
584,00:34:10,00:34:14,Rebecca McCormick. 235 Desert Ranch Road.
585,00:34:14,00:34:16,"First time, my ass."
586,00:34:33,00:34:35,Hi. Sorry to keep you waiting.
587,00:34:35,00:34:39,"So, what can I do to help out the Las Vegas Crime Lab?"
588,00:34:39,00:34:41,You could tell us about your relationship with Croix Richards.
589,00:34:41,00:34:46,"Well, uh, I hired Croix Richards to dominate Rebecca."
590,00:34:47,00:34:49,Would you like a chocolate?
591,00:34:49,00:34:50,"Uh, they're Godiva."
592,00:34:50,00:34:52,"WILLOWS: No, thanks."
593,00:34:52,00:34:56,I guess you could say that Mr. Richards worked for me.
594,00:34:56,00:35:02,We were hoping that he might help ease some of Rebecca's sexual difficulties.
595,00:35:02,00:35:06,WILLOWS: Extra-marital sex to help your relationship problems?
596,00:35:06,00:35:11,"The problem wasn't with our relationship, it was with my wife's lack of experience."
597,00:35:11,00:35:14,GRISSOM: Which Mr. Richards helped you with?
598,00:35:16,00:35:17,Yes.
599,00:35:17,00:35:22,"First over the Internet and then we, uh, we met with him a few times."
600,00:35:22,00:35:23,We?
601,00:35:23,00:35:25,"Yeah, yes."
602,00:35:25,00:35:27,"I participated in the sessions, yes."
603,00:35:28,00:35:31,CROIX: Do you take this man to be your wedded husband?
604,00:35:31,00:35:33,Love honor and obey.
605,00:35:33,00:35:34,Say it!
606,00:35:35,00:35:39,And these sessions were held at Lady Heather's?
607,00:35:39,00:35:40,Yes.
608,00:35:40,00:35:43,Lady Heather thought it would be best if I was involved.
609,00:35:43,00:35:47,"I'm sure secrets would've made the problem worse, at that point."
610,00:35:49,00:35:53,"Mrs. McCormick, did you meet Trey Buchman at Lady Heather's?"
611,00:35:54,00:35:55,"Oh, I'm sorry, who?"
612,00:35:55,00:35:57,GRISSOM: He worked for Lady Heather as well.
613,00:35:57,00:35:58,He's also dead.
614,00:35:59,00:36:00,Oh...
615,00:36:00,00:36:01,I don't know who Trey Buchman is.
616,00:36:01,00:36:02,Your wife does. Oh.
617,00:36:03,00:36:07,I met Trey on Lady Heather's Web Site.
618,00:36:07,00:36:09,Our encounters were only on-line.
619,00:36:09,00:36:11,Like this?
620,00:36:11,00:36:13,Is this okay?
621,00:36:13,00:36:14,"No, it's not okay!"
622,00:36:14,00:36:15,"Don't you know how to listen, you stupid bitch?!"
623,00:36:15,00:36:19,GRISSOM: And the night you and I met at the Tangiers?
624,00:36:21,00:36:23,Croix was fun.
625,00:36:23,00:36:27,"Uh, I wanted more experience. Variation."
626,00:36:27,00:36:28,I made a date with Trey.
627,00:36:28,00:36:30,He never showed up.
628,00:36:34,00:36:41,"Well, Mrs. McCormick, I'd like to get a sample of your hair and DNA for comparison."
629,00:36:41,00:36:44,Rebecca will give you anything that you need.
630,00:36:46,00:36:47,(bowl clanks)
631,00:37:40,00:37:43,(jackhammer pounding)
632,00:37:48,00:37:50,"Yeah, I can put you in touch with her manager, Eddie Willows."
633,00:37:50,00:37:52,Guy owes me a call.
634,00:37:52,00:37:53,Make that five calls.
635,00:37:53,00:37:56,"If you talk to him, tell him he's got, like, eight hours of studio fees due."
636,00:37:56,00:37:58,"The penalties are running, okay?"
637,00:37:58,00:38:00,We've already seen him. He's in the morgue.
638,00:38:00,00:38:03,"Oh, that makes sense why he wasn't here last night."
639,00:38:03,00:38:06,"High-strung singer, no manager, that's always trouble."
640,00:38:17,00:38:19,I hate this!
641,00:38:19,00:38:20,This sucks!
642,00:38:20,00:38:21,Okay?
643,00:38:21,00:38:22,Where is Eddie?
644,00:38:22,00:38:23,I need Eddie here.
645,00:38:23,00:38:24,Get back in the booth.
646,00:38:24,00:38:25,Where are you?
647,00:38:25,00:38:27,I need you here now.
648,00:38:27,00:38:28,I cannot do this without help.
649,00:38:28,00:38:30,"Can I have a little privacy, please?"
650,00:38:30,00:38:32,Would you go in there and learn how to do your job?
651,00:38:32,00:38:33,"It sounds terrible in there, anyways."
652,00:38:33,00:38:34,She started ragging on me.
653,00:38:34,00:38:35,"I didn't need the hot air, so I came back in."
654,00:38:36,00:38:38,"That's a cut, Enrique."
655,00:38:39,00:38:40,Let's take it from the bridge.
656,00:38:40,00:38:42,Eddie was just in it for the quick score.
657,00:38:42,00:38:47,"Cut a demo, sell a contract, get a ride on the charts and you just ride that wave."
658,00:38:47,00:38:48,This girl was different.
659,00:38:48,00:38:50,"Yeah, he was banging her."
660,00:38:50,00:38:54,"Yeah, but he had something for her, knowing how much potential she had."
661,00:38:54,00:38:55,I never seen Eddie so dedicated.
662,00:38:55,00:38:57,Nothing was going to stop him from making her a star.
663,00:38:57,00:38:59,Except maybe a .22 round in his gut.
664,00:38:59,00:39:01,"Stop, stop, stop. That's a cut, Enrique."
665,00:39:01,00:39:04,Whoa. It sounds good from where I'm standing-- what's up?
666,00:39:04,00:39:09,"The problem isn't the vocals, man, it's the extra bass line I keep getting from the Village People outside with that damn jackhammer."
667,00:39:09,00:39:12,"All right, Enrique, let's pick it up from the second chorus."
668,00:39:12,00:39:14,Aren't recording studios supposed to be soundproof?
669,00:39:14,00:39:18,"Lady, if the guy standing next to you is Clive Davis, instead of a cop, it would be."
670,00:39:18,00:39:20,"After Candeece left, did you guys keep recording?"
671,00:39:20,00:39:21,"Um, yeah, a few more hours."
672,00:39:21,00:39:23,We were redoing a drum track.
673,00:39:26,00:39:29,We're going to need to take a look at those tapes.
674,00:39:29,00:39:33,"BROWN: Okay, the hair on the left is from Trey Buchman's room at the Sphere hotel."
675,00:39:33,00:39:36,The hair on the right is a sample we took from Rebecca McCormick.
676,00:39:36,00:39:40,Cuticles on both are shiny and smooth.
677,00:39:40,00:39:43,Telltale signs the hair has been treated.
678,00:39:43,00:39:46,The cortex isn't letting any light through.
679,00:39:46,00:39:48,It lets us know the hair's been colored.
680,00:39:48,00:39:50,The medullas are continuous.
681,00:39:50,00:39:55,"I can't be definitive without DNA, but, uh, both pairs are consistent."
682,00:39:55,00:39:56,They look like Rebecca McCormick's.
683,00:39:58,00:40:02,"WILLOWS: So she lied to you guys at the hotel, she lied to us at the house."
684,00:40:02,00:40:04,"She's been with him, not just online."
685,00:40:04,00:40:08,"But her husband only knew about the guy he hired, Croix Richards."
686,00:40:08,00:40:12,He had no idea that she hired Trey Buchman.
687,00:40:12,00:40:15,HEATHER: Steven McCormick wanted his wife to have a session.
688,00:40:15,00:40:17,It's not uncommon.
689,00:40:17,00:40:21,"When a client achieves liberation, they often want their spouse to share that feeling."
690,00:40:21,00:40:28,Though in this particular instance I advised the husband to pursue avenues more suited to the temperament of his marriage.
691,00:40:28,00:40:30,I guess you couldn't say no.
692,00:40:30,00:40:33,I learned that Mr. McCormick is an investor in your Internet site.
693,00:40:33,00:40:35,That's a matter of public record.
694,00:40:35,00:40:39,"Did he ever tell you, specifically, what his wife's problem was?"
695,00:40:39,00:40:42,The fault lay not in his wife but in himself.
696,00:40:42,00:40:46,"Steven believed his wife was repressed, but once she opened up..."
697,00:40:46,00:40:48,A Pandora's Box?
698,00:40:48,00:40:52,All the evils of their marriage unleashed?
699,00:40:53,00:40:54,May I?
700,00:40:54,00:40:55,You may.
701,00:40:55,00:40:56,"Thank you, Lady Heather."
702,00:41:01,00:41:05,Steven came to me three years ago in a state of confusion.
703,00:41:05,00:41:08,I helped him clarify his need for dominance.
704,00:41:08,00:41:12,You will control her only as well as you can read her.
705,00:41:15,00:41:16,Now read.
706,00:41:23,00:41:25,Our work enabled him to marry.
707,00:41:25,00:41:32,But he chose a woman who didn't understand the dynamics of a dominant-submissive relationship.
708,00:41:32,00:41:37,"Unfortunately, the language we speak in here doesn't necessarily translate to the world out there."
709,00:41:37,00:41:40,"No, in here, the submissive has the power."
710,00:41:40,00:41:44,All he has to do is say the safety word and everything stops.
711,00:41:47,00:41:48,"Very good, Mr. Grissom."
712,00:41:48,00:41:52,I'm just repeating what I've heard.
713,00:41:52,00:41:54,You're a good listener.
714,00:41:54,00:41:55,Part of the job.
715,00:41:57,00:41:59,So this is work?
716,00:41:59,00:42:00,Yes.
717,00:42:00,00:42:02,But I value your insight.
718,00:42:02,00:42:04,I'm flattered.
719,00:42:04,00:42:08,But you already seem to know the answers to your questions.
720,00:42:08,00:42:15,"You keep me in proximity when I walk away and when I'm close, you watch my lips."
721,00:42:18,00:42:20,Are you losing your hearing?
722,00:42:22,00:42:25,I'm losing my balance.
723,00:42:25,00:42:27,Your sense of self?
724,00:42:27,00:42:29,No.
725,00:42:29,00:42:31,I know who I am.
726,00:42:31,00:42:33,Do you?
727,00:42:33,00:42:36,"Yes, I do."
728,00:42:53,00:42:56,You can always say stop.
729,00:42:58,00:43:01,So can you.
730,00:43:09,00:43:11,Eddie's my manager.
731,00:43:11,00:43:12,It's no big secret.
732,00:43:12,00:43:16,"We were supposed to be working last night, and the jerk blew me off."
733,00:43:16,00:43:18,VEGA: So you never saw him last night?
734,00:43:18,00:43:20,No. What happened to your wrist?
735,00:43:22,00:43:23,"Oh, uh..."
736,00:43:23,00:43:24,"I got, uh..."
737,00:43:24,00:43:25,um...
738,00:43:25,00:43:30,"Because, uh, according to Desert Palms Emergency Room, you came in last night with a fracture of the ulna."
739,00:43:30,00:43:33,It's a common injury in car accidents-- air bag specific.
740,00:43:36,00:43:40,SIDLE (over speaker): Air bags are packed with cornstarch or talc.
741,00:43:41,00:43:42,It helps them deploy.
742,00:43:42,00:43:44,It also wreaks havoc on the eyes.
743,00:43:44,00:43:45,We know you saw Eddie last night.
744,00:43:45,00:43:48,We know that you were driving his car.
745,00:43:49,00:43:51,"It all happened so fast, you know?"
746,00:43:51,00:43:57,"One minute I was, I was just outside getting some air and thinking, you know?"
747,00:43:57,00:44:03,"And then... the next, my manager is stumbling towards me, bleeding."
748,00:44:03,00:44:04,(gunshot)
749,00:44:04,00:44:05,"Candeece, baby, I'm shot!"
750,00:44:05,00:44:06,"Eddie! Oh, my God!"
751,00:44:06,00:44:09,(gasping) I'll get you in the car.
752,00:44:09,00:44:11,"Everything's going to be okay, honey."
753,00:44:11,00:44:12,"Okay, don't be afraid."
754,00:44:12,00:44:14,Sounds pretty heroic.
755,00:44:14,00:44:16,Not really.
756,00:44:16,00:44:22,"When you're intimate with somebody, you can't imagine life without them."
757,00:44:22,00:44:25,We were partners.
758,00:44:25,00:44:27,Ilovedhim.
759,00:44:27,00:44:29,I thought I was going to die.
760,00:44:29,00:44:32,There were two other people in the car.
761,00:44:32,00:44:35,"That's what I meant, you know?"
762,00:44:35,00:44:37,I thought we wereall going to die.
763,00:44:38,00:44:40,Search and Rescue found Eddie's body 100 yards downstream.
764,00:44:40,00:44:45,"See, that's where it gets a little less heroic-- we found Lindseyalone in a sinking car."
765,00:44:45,00:44:47,I tried to get Eddie out.
766,00:44:47,00:44:51,"He was unconscious, and that... that kid kept screaming."
767,00:44:51,00:44:54,The current was really strong and we got swept downstream.
768,00:44:54,00:44:56,What was I supposed to do?
769,00:44:56,00:45:01,"Get to a phone, call the cops, call an ambulance, anything, actually, other than what you did."
770,00:45:01,00:45:02,I am just one person.
771,00:45:02,00:45:06,"Eddie is my priority, not that..."
772,00:45:06,00:45:09,"that stupid, screaming little brat."
773,00:45:11,00:45:12,"I tried, I..."
774,00:45:12,00:45:14,"You even think about my daughter again, I'll kill you."
775,00:45:14,00:45:15,I will kill you.
776,00:45:15,00:45:17,I will hunt you down and put...
777,00:45:17,00:45:18,I will put you in the ground! Catherine.
778,00:45:18,00:45:19,You saw that.
779,00:45:19,00:45:21,She threatened me!
780,00:45:21,00:45:22,I want a lawyer.
781,00:45:22,00:45:24,What the hell are you doing?
782,00:45:24,00:45:27,Do you know where you're at right now?
783,00:45:27,00:45:29,I've been here alot longer than you...
784,00:45:29,00:45:30,And you should know better.
785,00:45:30,00:45:33,And I wouldn't have to be here if you were doing your job properly.
786,00:45:33,00:45:37,There is a difference between me doing my job and you wanting to do it for me.
787,00:45:37,00:45:39,You don't want to get the job done.
788,00:45:39,00:45:40,"What you want, right now, is revenge."
789,00:45:41,00:45:42,"You're going to tell me what I want, huh?"
790,00:45:42,00:45:44,"Go home, Catherine."
791,00:45:44,00:45:45,Be with your daughter.
792,00:45:45,00:45:47,She's the one that needs you.
793,00:45:57,00:45:59,GRISSOM: What did you consider this?
794,00:45:59,00:46:02,"A little civility before work, I think?"
795,00:46:02,00:46:04,Or a ritual to put us at ease.
796,00:46:04,00:46:12,"Or how about ""In custom and ceremony, are innocence and beauty born."" Yeats..."
797,00:46:12,00:46:16,"""Prayer for My Daughter."" Or our morning."
798,00:46:16,00:46:17,Cream?
799,00:46:17,00:46:19,Please.
800,00:46:22,00:46:24,Thank you.
801,00:46:24,00:46:25,Sugar?
802,00:46:25,00:46:27,I'm diabetic.
803,00:46:30,00:46:31,Type One?
804,00:46:31,00:46:33,Mm-hmm.
805,00:46:33,00:46:35,Injections.
806,00:46:35,00:46:36,Used to mean injections.
807,00:46:36,00:46:39,I changed to a pressure syringe.
808,00:46:42,00:46:44,Recently?
809,00:46:44,00:46:45,"Mm, a few weeks ago."
810,00:46:45,00:46:48,"Oh, it's a fascinating instrument; would you like to see it?"
811,00:46:50,00:46:51,"Yes, I would."
812,00:46:52,00:46:54,But I'm afraid I'll need a warrant.
813,00:46:57,00:46:59,Excuse me.
814,00:47:07,00:47:08,It's Grissom.
815,00:47:08,00:47:15,"I need you to write paper on Lady Heather's medical paraphernalia-- specifically, an insulin kit and syringes."
816,00:47:17,00:47:18,I'm already there.
817,00:47:18,00:47:20,I'll wait.
818,00:47:25,00:47:32,"I think I just heard you say ""stop."" BRASS: You lied to us, Mrs. McCormick."
819,00:47:32,00:47:37,You said you only engaged in on-line sex with Trey Buchman.
820,00:47:38,00:47:42,Your hair has a similar morphology to the hair that we found in Mr. Buchman's hotel suite.
821,00:47:43,00:47:46,"Well, ""similar"" doesn't mean me."
822,00:47:46,00:47:50,"No, but the DNA we also recovered from under the sheets does mean you."
823,00:47:51,00:47:53,BRASS: Sounds like a physical encounter to me.
824,00:47:56,00:47:59,"So, since I pay for sex, I must also be a murderer?"
825,00:47:59,00:48:03,"No, it's just that everybody you pay for sex ends up dead."
826,00:48:03,00:48:05,I don't like you.
827,00:48:05,00:48:08,"Well, I guess I'll have to live with that."
828,00:48:09,00:48:13,Here's something else you might not like.
829,00:48:13,00:48:17,"Two months ago, your bank records show cash withdrawals totaling $50,000."
830,00:48:17,00:48:21,BROWN: The same amount that we found in Croix Richards' apartment.
831,00:48:21,00:48:24,Croix wasn't even half that good.
832,00:48:24,00:48:26,"Of course, that's still better than my husband."
833,00:48:30,00:48:32,"You used to work for Latona Pharmaceuticals, right?"
834,00:48:32,00:48:34,Years ago.
835,00:48:34,00:48:36,You sold synthetic insulin.
836,00:48:36,00:48:40,All right. Mm-hmm.
837,00:48:40,00:48:44,"We've had our fun, but I'm stopping it now."
838,00:48:44,00:48:47,Any other questions you have can be directed to my lawyer.
839,00:48:49,00:48:54,"Well, modern recording's all digital so each track's recorded in a separate data file."
840,00:48:54,00:49:00,"By looking at the file modification times, we can approximate which tracks were recorded near the time of the shooting."
841,00:49:00,00:49:01,Catherine left Eddie at 5:30 p.m.
842,00:49:01,00:49:03,Lindsey's first call was logged at 10:55.
843,00:49:06,00:49:07,"Let's see, well..."
844,00:49:07,00:49:11,only two tracks were laid down during that time interval.
845,00:49:11,00:49:14,"""7:41: acoustic guitar..."
846,00:49:14,00:49:17,"10:38: drum track."" Let's look at the drum track."
847,00:49:17,00:49:19,(medium-tempo drumbeat playing)
848,00:49:19,00:49:22,There's the kit drum.
849,00:49:22,00:49:25,So any irregularity in the pattern could be from an outside source.
850,00:49:25,00:49:26,Yeah.
851,00:49:26,00:49:27,Right here.
852,00:49:28,00:49:30,A sudden change in amplitude.
853,00:49:30,00:49:32,Can you isolate it?
854,00:49:32,00:49:34,Yeah.
855,00:49:34,00:49:38,(distant bang amid drumming)
856,00:49:38,00:49:40,Sounds like gunfire.
857,00:49:40,00:49:41,I'll play it again.
858,00:49:44,00:49:45,(distant bang amid drumming)
859,00:49:47,00:49:50,Let me take out the drums.
860,00:49:54,00:49:56,(two distant bangs)
861,00:49:56,00:49:59,(faint whirring)
862,00:49:59,00:50:00,What is that?
863,00:50:00,00:50:03,Feels like an engine.
864,00:50:03,00:50:04,"V-twin, maybe."
865,00:50:04,00:50:06,Must have been somebody else there.
866,00:50:06,00:50:08,You think we got a witness?
867,00:50:08,00:50:09,Or a suspect.
868,00:50:09,00:50:10,Hey...
869,00:50:10,00:50:12,I was able to pull the phone records for Candeece.
870,00:50:12,00:50:13,She made six calls that night.
871,00:50:13,00:50:14,The first five went to Eddie.
872,00:50:15,00:50:16,But not the last one.
873,00:50:16,00:50:17,You got an address?
874,00:50:17,00:50:19,MAN: I get all kind of calls.
875,00:50:19,00:50:21,It could've been a girl that I slept with.
876,00:50:21,00:50:23,Or a girl that I didn't sleep with.
877,00:50:23,00:50:24,Could've been a wrong number.
878,00:50:24,00:50:26,Since when do wrong numbers last for four minutes?
879,00:50:26,00:50:29,"You hear a sexy voice on the phone, what are you gonna do, you gonna hang up?"
880,00:50:30,00:50:31,So you do remember the call.
881,00:50:31,00:50:33,I like your Harley.
882,00:50:35,00:50:38,"Look, Kiner, you're on parole; you got no rights."
883,00:50:38,00:50:39,Looking at two strikes.
884,00:50:39,00:50:43,"I'm not trying to pull a fast ball on you, but it's not the first time you've talked to Candeece."
885,00:50:43,00:50:44,KINER: So maybe me and Candy are friends.
886,00:50:44,00:50:46,VEGA: Werefriends.
887,00:50:46,00:50:48,You guys used to talk once a day.
888,00:50:48,00:50:50,"Then she stopped calling you, until last night."
889,00:50:51,00:50:52,People change.
890,00:50:52,00:50:56,Fell into a bad element.
891,00:50:56,00:50:59,"Mr. Kiner, do you own this house?"
892,00:50:59,00:51:01,My father left it to me.
893,00:51:01,00:51:02,Your father have a drug problem?
894,00:51:03,00:51:05,We found GHB in your garage.
895,00:51:05,00:51:07,"""Georgia Home Boy."" Tell us what happened with Eddie."
896,00:51:08,00:51:12,"Candy needed ""help."" EDDIE: Hey, hey, hey!"
897,00:51:12,00:51:13,What are you doing here?
898,00:51:13,00:51:15,What are you selling her drugs for?
899,00:51:15,00:51:16,What are you doing?
900,00:51:16,00:51:17,I wanted you clean.
901,00:51:17,00:51:18,"Hey, please..."
902,00:51:18,00:51:19,"What do you want, huh?"
903,00:51:19,00:51:20,This what you want?
904,00:51:20,00:51:21,(gunshot)
905,00:51:21,00:51:22,I got on my hog.
906,00:51:22,00:51:23,I got the hell out of there.
907,00:51:24,00:51:25,What do you expect me to do?
908,00:51:25,00:51:26,Go back to the joint for her?
909,00:51:30,00:51:32,Cuff him.
910,00:51:35,00:51:36,"Quid pro quo, right?"
911,00:51:36,00:51:42,"Steven invests in your business, you kill the two guys who are messing around with his wife."
912,00:51:42,00:51:44,"I could help you, Mr. Brass..."
913,00:51:44,00:51:45,with your inadequacy.
914,00:51:45,00:51:48,"You know, I'd like that, Lady H."
915,00:51:48,00:51:50,It's tough being me.
916,00:51:52,00:51:57,I'd like to feel more secure in my role as a homicide detective.
917,00:51:58,00:52:00,You know what really gets me wild?
918,00:52:00,00:52:02,The truth.
919,00:52:02,00:52:04,Are you up for that?
920,00:52:06,00:52:10,(over speaker): Mr. Grissom collected samples of my insulin.
921,00:52:10,00:52:14,He's undoubtedly identified it as non-synthetic.
922,00:52:14,00:52:15,BRASS: He told me it was beef insulin.
923,00:52:15,00:52:18,"HEATHER: Which, I take it, matches the insulin found in the two victims."
924,00:52:18,00:52:24,BRASS: Do you know that only seven percent of diabetics in this country use an animal-based insulin?
925,00:52:24,00:52:26,They import yours from Great Britain.
926,00:52:26,00:52:28,HEATHER: Which narrows the field down even further.
927,00:52:28,00:52:29,BRASS: Right into your dominion.
928,00:52:30,00:52:31,My personal area is open.
929,00:52:31,00:52:35,Anyone could've walked right in and stolen from me.
930,00:52:37,00:52:38,Is it something I said?
931,00:52:41,00:52:44,I'm disappointed in you.
932,00:52:45,00:52:49,But not surprised.
933,00:52:49,00:52:50,You fear me...
934,00:52:51,00:52:54,because I've committed the one unforgivable act.
935,00:52:54,00:52:56,"No, it's more like two acts..."
936,00:52:56,00:52:58,of murder.
937,00:53:01,00:53:03,I know you.
938,00:53:03,00:53:07,"And I know that in your heart, you don't believe I did this."
939,00:53:07,00:53:09,BRASS: Lady Heather...
940,00:53:09,00:53:11,this has nothing to do with heart.
941,00:53:11,00:53:12,It's all about the evidence.
942,00:54:11,00:54:12,Greg...
943,00:54:13,00:54:15,I need you to process these right away.
944,00:54:15,00:54:17,Priority.
945,00:54:17,00:54:18,Grissom!
946,00:54:18,00:54:20,We got a problem.
947,00:54:29,00:54:31,WILLOWS: Stranglings are intimate.
948,00:54:32,00:54:33,Crime of passion.
949,00:54:39,00:54:41,Or not.
950,00:55:00,00:55:01,Mr. McCormick...
951,00:55:01,00:55:04,were you the one who found your wife?
952,00:55:04,00:55:06,Yes.
953,00:55:06,00:55:08,On the stairs?
954,00:55:08,00:55:11,Yes.
955,00:55:11,00:55:13,"May I see your hands, please?"
956,00:55:22,00:55:24,Other side.
957,00:55:31,00:55:33,They look clean.
958,00:55:33,00:55:35,Mm.
959,00:55:35,00:55:38,Should they be?
960,00:55:42,00:55:43,I don't know.
961,00:55:44,00:55:47,"If it were my spouse, I would've touched the body."
962,00:55:47,00:55:50,Mm. I didn't.
963,00:56:04,00:56:06,Kiner is a drug dealer.
964,00:56:06,00:56:08,Your drug dealer.
965,00:56:08,00:56:09,No. Not anymore.
966,00:56:09,00:56:11,Eddie got me off all that stuff.
967,00:56:11,00:56:12,VEGA: You called Kiner.
968,00:56:12,00:56:13,He came here.
969,00:56:13,00:56:14,I tried to call Eddie.
970,00:56:15,00:56:16,He had his phone off.
971,00:56:16,00:56:19,He was with his pain-in-the-ass daughter and that psycho ex-wife of his.
972,00:56:20,00:56:24,I was just alone in front of a microphone with my whole career riding on a demo.
973,00:56:24,00:56:26,It's none of your business.
974,00:56:26,00:56:27,"Hey, Eddie."
975,00:56:27,00:56:28,What? (gunshot)
976,00:56:28,00:56:30,"(grunts) Oh, my God!"
977,00:56:30,00:56:32,I thought Eddie wasn't coming.
978,00:56:32,00:56:36,I guess he was just late.
979,00:56:41,00:56:48,The material we found in Rebecca McCormick's wound was nylon thread with fragments of ostrich feather.
980,00:56:48,00:56:49,"Oh, I know that look."
981,00:56:49,00:56:50,We're going back to Lady Heather's.
982,00:56:50,00:56:52,I can take care of this myself.
983,00:56:52,00:56:53,"Gil, do me a favor. Get a sports car."
984,00:56:53,00:56:56,It's a lot cheaper and easier to handle.
985,00:56:56,00:56:57,(doorbell rings)
986,00:57:00,00:57:02,I'd like to come in.
987,00:57:02,00:57:04,Of course you would.
988,00:57:04,00:57:05,Say the magic word.
989,00:57:05,00:57:08,Warrant?
990,00:57:08,00:57:09,We don't have one.
991,00:57:09,00:57:15,"GRISSOM: The, uh, submissive that was in here yesterday was wearing a feather boa."
992,00:57:15,00:57:16,That would be Chloe.
993,00:57:17,00:57:18,"Chloe, uh...?"
994,00:57:18,00:57:20,Chloe Samms.
995,00:57:20,00:57:26,She uses it as a garrote-- a way to control her breathing to heighten the experience for the dominant client.
996,00:57:26,00:57:28,Hmm.
997,00:57:43,00:57:46,Same scent as Trey Buchman's crime scene.
998,00:57:46,00:57:50,Remember the strawberry foam?
999,00:57:50,00:57:52,Do these belong to Chloe?
1000,00:57:52,00:57:54,I believe so.
1001,00:57:54,00:57:57,"BRASS: Well, the shoes link Chloe to the nightclub and this job links Chloe to the two vics."
1002,00:57:57,00:57:58,Where is she?
1003,00:57:58,00:57:59,She quit yesterday.
1004,00:57:59,00:58:01,I bet I know why.
1005,00:58:01,00:58:03,"Well, if she's in town, I'll find her."
1006,00:58:09,00:58:11,I owe you an apology.
1007,00:58:11,00:58:14,Apologies are just words.
1008,00:58:23,00:58:25,So you're calling it?
1009,00:58:31,00:58:33,I got two liars and no murder weapon...
1010,00:58:33,00:58:35,and no choice.
1011,00:58:35,00:58:41,"I'm going to nail the singer on child endangerment, and fleeing the scene, and the dealer goes up on possession for sale."
1012,00:58:47,00:58:50,What a great bedtime story for my little girl.
1013,00:58:50,00:58:54,"Cat, I did my best."
1014,00:58:58,00:59:01,No-needle syringe used on the vic at the foam party.
1015,00:59:01,00:59:07,"I recovered some epithelials from the plunger end, compared them to your reference sample."
1016,00:59:11,00:59:14,"That girl you have in custody, it's her DNA."
1017,00:59:15,00:59:17,Case closed.
1018,00:59:18,00:59:19,"Thank you, Greg."
1019,00:59:34,00:59:36,Look familiar?
1020,00:59:39,00:59:44,Insulin was injected into Trey Buchman's shoulder at this end...
1021,00:59:44,00:59:46,by you.
1022,00:59:52,00:59:56,Your epithelials were found at the plunger end.
1023,00:59:56,01:00:04,Epithelials are skin cells filled with DNA-- your genetic fingerprint.
1024,01:00:04,01:00:09,"BRASS: So, you're going to tell us why and you're going to tell us why you strangled Rebecca McCormick."
1025,01:00:10,01:00:14,For Steven.
1026,01:00:16,01:00:18,I belong to him.
1027,01:00:18,01:00:24,McCORMICK: Chloe had a problem controlling her emotions.
1028,01:00:24,01:00:26,She let things get personal.
1029,01:00:26,01:00:28,"Define ""personal,"" in your crowd."
1030,01:00:28,01:00:29,"In my ""crowd""?"
1031,01:00:29,01:00:30,Yeah.
1032,01:00:37,01:00:41,GRISSOM: So you started seeing each other outside of Lady Heather's?
1033,01:00:42,01:00:43,"We'd meet occasionally, yes."
1034,01:00:43,01:00:45,Listen...
1035,01:00:45,01:00:47,my wife had a problem with sex.
1036,01:00:47,01:00:50,"Sounds like she had a problem with you, pal."
1037,01:00:50,01:00:52,My wife had a problem with sex.
1038,01:00:52,01:00:55,"And at Lady Heather's, I fixed her."
1039,01:00:55,01:00:56,"Oh, you fixed her?"
1040,01:00:56,01:00:58,Yes.
1041,01:00:58,01:00:59,She stay fixed?
1042,01:00:59,01:01:04,"Yeah, you fixed her so good that she started spending your money to get other men to give her what you couldn't."
1043,01:01:04,01:01:05,Rebecca was out of control.
1044,01:01:05,01:01:07,So you got her to kill Richards and Buchman.
1045,01:01:07,01:01:08,"No, I didn't."
1046,01:01:08,01:01:11,"And then you told her to kill your wife. No, I loved my wife."
1047,01:01:11,01:01:12,I didn't tell Chloe to do anything.
1048,01:01:12,01:01:16,What happened? She killed Richards and Buchman on her own.
1049,01:01:16,01:01:20,Okay.
1050,01:01:24,01:01:27,Chloe thought that killing your wife's lovers would please you.
1051,01:01:29,01:01:31,And it did please you.
1052,01:01:31,01:01:33,I told her to stop.
1053,01:01:33,01:01:35,But she didn't obey you.
1054,01:01:35,01:01:37,She killed your wife.
1055,01:01:39,01:01:42,You couldn't make Chloe do what you wanted.
1056,01:01:42,01:01:48,All that time at Lady Heather's and you never learned that the submissive is the one in control?
1057,01:01:51,01:01:54,I told her to stop.
1058,01:02:32,01:02:39,(crying)
