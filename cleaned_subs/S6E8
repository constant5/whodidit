0	00:00:07	00:00:17	This is Channel 8 News reporting with an update to yesterday's wild police pursuit and shootout where three suspects and one police officer were killed by gunfire at Third and Jefferson.
1	00:00:17	00:00:23	Shortly after being taken into custody, Jose Fausto, the last suspect was gunned down by an unknown...
2	00:00:25	00:00:27	Down! Everybody down! Down!
3	00:00:28	00:00:32	Somebody shot this guy in front of all these cops?
4	00:00:32	00:00:35	They did not want him talking to us.
5	00:00:35	00:00:38	This was not some doped up drive-by.
6	00:00:38	00:00:39	The shooter had skill.
7	00:00:39	00:00:42	Just one shot went through the ten ring.
8	00:00:42	00:00:44	How'd they know Fausto was here?
9	00:00:44	00:00:46	I don't know.
10	00:00:46	00:00:48	I bet you he tried to reach out for help, you know?
11	00:00:48	00:00:50	Maybe money or a ticket out of here.
12	00:00:51	00:00:53	I'll check the phone records and see if there was any calls in or out.
13	00:00:53	00:00:55	Glad I'm not Vartann.
14	00:00:56	00:00:57	He's got to tell the UnderSheriff.
15	00:00:57	00:01:04	Are you seriously telling me our only live suspect, a cop killer, was gunned down in your custody?
16	00:01:04	00:01:05	I'm sorry to say yes, sir.
17	00:01:05	00:01:06	And you didn't catch the shooter?
18	00:01:06	00:01:07	That's also correct, sir.
19	00:01:07	00:01:10	Stop calling me sir, you worthless... ( sighs)
20	00:01:10	00:01:12	Where's Grissom?
21	00:01:12	00:01:13	He's on his way.
22	00:01:13	00:01:14	All right, let's start without him.
23	00:01:14	00:01:19	Sergeant Adams and Officer Bell were making a routine traffic stop on a Buick.
24	00:01:19	00:01:23	Before they were able to effect the stop, a stolen Caprice intervened.
25	00:01:23	00:01:26	Adams said they just cut him off and started firing.
26	00:01:27	00:01:31	They were followed in pursuit by officers Davis and Carroll and detectives Brass and Curtis.
27	00:01:32	00:01:34	The, uh, Caprice TC'd during the pursuit.
28	00:01:39	00:01:40	And they just kept firing.
29	00:01:42	00:01:43	We got three of them off of prints.
30	00:01:44	00:01:47	Priors for narcotics and connections to the Mexican Mafia.
31	00:01:47	00:01:53	And additional set of prints from the Caprice came back to Jose Fausto, the guy shot at the motel.
32	00:01:53	00:01:54	I've heard enough about him.
33	00:01:54	00:01:59	Why would these knuckleheads pull in front of a police car making a traffic stop and engage us in a gunfight?
34	00:02:00	00:02:05	If the Buick was moving drugs, maybe the Caprice was providing security, keeping the cops and rival gang members away.
35	00:02:05	00:02:08	We don't have the Buick, so there's no evidence to confirm that.
36	00:02:08	00:02:13	Well, if these guys were a bunch of drug-dealing thugs, why on the news were they unarmed and we shot 'em in the back?
37	00:02:13	00:02:15	'Cause that's what the eyewitnesses are saying.
38	00:02:17	00:02:20	And that we shot an innocent high school kid riding his bike.
39	00:02:22	00:02:29	Uh, Ricardo Estevez, male Hispanic, 22, shot in the alley east of Third.
40	00:02:29	00:02:33	Three entrance wounds to the front torso, none to the back.
41	00:02:33	00:02:37	Ballistics matched the bullets to Sergeant Carroll's gun.
42	00:02:37	00:02:40	Recovered a .45 auto next to the body.
43	00:02:40	00:02:45	Captain Brass states the suspect had it pointed at the sergeant when he came around the corner.
44	00:02:45	00:02:50	We have eyewitnesses who claim that they saw the suspect with his hands raised just before he was shot.
45	00:02:51	00:02:53	Can we resolve this?
46	00:02:53	00:02:58	Sergeant Carroll partially confirms eyewitness accounts.
47	00:02:58	00:03:03	When Captain Brass approached, he momentarily took his eyes off the suspect.
48	00:03:03	00:03:05	When he looked back, the suspect was holding a gun.
49	00:03:06	00:03:07	Probably pulled it from his waistband.
50	00:03:07	00:03:10	There's no evidence to place the gun in the suspect's hand at that point.
51	00:03:10	00:03:12	What about the guy in the other alley?
52	00:03:13	00:03:19	Salvador Rosario, 19, also shot in the front.
53	00:03:23	00:03:24	Autopsy's pending.
54	00:03:24	00:03:29	Chemical tests show that he held a gun.
55	00:03:29	00:03:31	You're not going to believe this.
56	00:03:31	00:03:38	A bullet from Officer Davis' gun hit the suspect's revolver, jamming the cylinder.
57	00:03:38	00:03:42	That would mean the revolver had to be pointing at Officer Davis.
58	00:03:42	00:03:47	There are several eyewitnesses who claim that they saw him plant the gun on the body.
59	00:03:47	00:03:48	It wasn't planted. It was mishandled.
60	00:03:48	00:03:50	Mishandled by who?
61	00:03:50	00:03:54	Contrary to policy, Officer Davis prematurely picked up the gun.
62	00:03:54	00:03:58	Detective Curtis instructed him to set it back down,  which he did.
63	00:03:58	00:03:59	What are you doing? Put it down.
64	00:03:59	00:04:01	Sorry, I was just trying to secure his gun.
65	00:04:01	00:04:05	An eyewitness seeing that certainly could misinterpret it as planting a gun.
66	00:04:08	00:04:12	Please tell me you've got some good news.
67	00:04:12	00:04:17	I have the autopsy findings on Leandro Chavez.
68	00:04:17	00:04:19	He died of survivable wounds.
69	00:04:19	00:04:22	Bled out at the crime scene waiting for transport.
70	00:04:24	00:04:26	Dame una ambulanica quey.
71	00:04:26	00:04:27	I don't speak Spanish.
72	00:04:28	00:04:29	There's justification for this.
73	00:04:29	00:04:31	I can't wait to hear what that is.
74	00:04:31	00:04:34	Paramedics prioritized transport of the injured.
75	00:04:34	00:04:36	Downed officer first, civilians next.
76	00:04:36	00:04:40	By the time they got to the suspect, he'd passed on.
77	00:04:40	00:04:42	Just a little retroactive birth control.
78	00:04:42	00:04:46	See, this is the problem that the community has with us.
79	00:04:46	00:04:49	You don't speak Spanish, so you think they don't speak English and then when you run your mouth...
80	00:04:49	00:04:51	All right, keep on point here.
81	00:04:52	00:04:55	Which one of these buttheads shot Officer Bell?
82	00:04:55	00:05:00	We have reason to believe that Officer Bell was killed by friendly fire.
83	00:05:03	00:05:06	It was a through-and-through, and we haven't recovered the bullet yet.
84	00:05:07	00:05:08	It's a big crime scene.
85	00:05:08	00:05:09	Unacceptable.
86	00:05:09	00:05:11	Get back out there and find that bullet.
87	00:05:12	00:05:14	I don't care if it takes everybody you got working around the clock.
88	00:05:14	00:05:17	I said we haven't found it yet.
89	00:05:17	00:05:20	I didn't say we weren't looking.
90	00:05:52	00:05:55	I'm supposed to do whatever it takes to find that bullet.
91	00:05:55	00:05:56	Don't worry about the overtime.
92	00:05:57	00:06:00	As soon as day shift comes in, I'll send them out, too.
93	00:06:00	00:06:01	Hey, Grissom.
94	00:06:01	00:06:07	So Warrick recovered a nine-millimeter pistol from Fausto's motel room, and I matched it to the cartridge case from the kid in the hospital.
95	00:06:07	00:06:09	I also found the kid's bike there.
96	00:06:10	00:06:15	Shot him in the back for his bike. Great.
97	00:06:15	00:06:16	Hey.
98	00:06:17	00:06:19	I left you a couple of messages.
99	00:06:19	00:06:23	Oh, yeah... I haven't gotten to them yet.
100	00:06:23	00:06:24	Sorry.
101	00:06:24	00:06:26	You're on administrative leave, though.
102	00:06:26	00:06:27	You should be home getting some rest.
103	00:06:27	00:06:29	Yeah, I tried.
104	00:06:29	00:06:32	But I...
105	00:06:32	00:06:37	can't stop thinking about this... this Bell shooting.
106	00:06:37	00:06:39	It's understandable.
107	00:06:39	00:06:46	Grissom, I think there may be a possibility that maybe... I shot him.
108	00:06:47	00:06:51	Sofia... we can't discuss the investigation.
109	00:06:51	00:06:53	It's, it's something I remember when I was giving my statement.
110	00:06:53	00:06:54	Then it's already on the record.
111	00:06:54	00:06:55	No, something I didn't mention.
112	00:06:55	00:06:56	Sofia...
113	00:06:56	00:06:57	Please listen to me.
114	00:06:59	00:07:03	Bell was between me and the suspect.
115	00:07:03	00:07:07	I was shooting over his cover, which is a violation of policy.
116	00:07:10	00:07:15	I was, I was just trying to stay alive.
117	00:07:16	00:07:17	But if I did it, I...
118	00:07:17	00:07:19	Hey, Grissom, I have a question.
119	00:07:21	00:07:22	Sofia?
120	00:07:24	00:07:26	You're on administrative leave.
121	00:07:26	00:07:28	I know.
122	00:07:28	00:07:29	You should not be in this building.
123	00:07:29	00:07:31	I was just talking to a friend.
124	00:07:31	00:07:34	If I can't talk to a friend, who the hell am I supposed to talk to?
125	00:07:34	00:07:35	Any friend outside the department.
126	00:07:36	00:07:38	And how many friends outside of work do you have, Sarah?
127	00:07:38	00:07:40	Maybe I should go talk to my mother.
128	00:07:40	00:07:42	Oh, no, sorry. I forgot. She's a cop, too.
129	00:07:42	00:07:44	I can recommend a departmental psychologist.
130	00:07:52	00:07:53	All right, then.
131	00:07:53	00:07:56	This was a really bad idea. I'm sorry.
132	00:08:17	00:08:18	Hey, listen.
133	00:08:18	00:08:23	One of the officers searching for the shooter found an expended cartridge up there on the seventh floor.
134	00:08:28	00:08:30	That would put him in the right position.
135	00:08:30	00:08:31	Freemont Street's not far.
136	00:08:31	00:08:33	It makes for an easy escape.
137	00:08:41	00:08:42	Good job.
138	00:08:55	00:08:57	Nice.
139	00:09:14	00:09:17	.223 Remington.
140	00:09:17	00:09:19	Most likely from a semiauto.
141	00:09:19	00:09:20	Didn't even bother to pick it up.
142	00:09:20	00:09:23	Yeah. Wasn't afraid of getting caught.
143	00:09:23	00:09:27	I'll give it to Bobby. Have him run it through IBIS.
144	00:09:27	00:09:29	See if the gun was used before.
145	00:09:29	00:09:32	Vartann, this is Cavaliere.
146	00:09:32	00:09:38	We've recovered an expended .223 cartridge case from a building overlooking the motel.
147	00:09:38	00:09:40	It's on its way to the lab now.
148	00:09:40	00:09:41	Scene here is secure.
149	00:09:41	00:09:43	Patrol just called.
150	00:09:43	00:09:47	They found a 411-A behind 5203 Maryland Parkway.
151	00:09:47	00:09:49	Sounds like it might be the Buick Regal.
152	00:09:49	00:09:50	I'm going to head over there now.
153	00:09:55	00:09:58	Buick Regal, no plates.
154	00:09:58	00:10:00	You run the VIN?
155	00:10:00	00:10:02	Yeah. It came up stolen.
156	00:10:02	00:10:05	Yeah. It's a good chance this is the car we're looking for.
157	00:10:08	00:10:10	Yep.
158	00:10:10	00:10:12	Torched it to destroy any evidence.
159	00:10:12	00:10:15	Let's get this thing towed back to the lab, okay?
160	00:10:15	00:10:17	You got it.
161	00:10:17	00:10:22	Sergeant Adams, this is your standard after-shooting walk through, okay?
162	00:10:22	00:10:26	Now I want you to describe to us exactly what happened yesterday morning.
163	00:10:26	00:10:29	We were southbound on Roosevelt.
164	00:10:29	00:10:34	Bell observed a male and female Hispanic having a domestic dispute.
165	00:10:34	00:10:35	Where were they?
166	00:10:35	00:10:37	Over in that last spot.
167	00:10:37	00:10:40	They got out of a green Geo Metro.
168	00:10:40	00:10:44	Walked this way. By the time we'd turned around, they'd gotten into the Buick Regal.
169	00:10:44	00:10:46	They were driving away.
170	00:10:46	00:10:50	She was pregnant, about to pop, just like Bell's wife.
171	00:10:50	00:10:51	He said we should pull 'em over.
172	00:10:51	00:10:52	Which way'd they go?
173	00:10:52	00:10:55	Southbound on Roosevelt.
174	00:10:55	00:10:59	As soon as we turned on Desert Springs, the Caprice cut us off.
175	00:10:59	00:11:00	Okay, thanks.
176	00:11:00	00:11:02	Hey, hang around for about a minute or two, okay?
177	00:11:02	00:11:03	I'll give you a ride home.
178	00:11:05	00:11:06	Your thoughts?
179	00:11:06	00:11:08	I wonder if that camera works.
180	00:11:10	00:11:12	Well, it's worth checking out.
181	00:11:12	00:11:13	Come on. I'll even let you buy me a donut.
182	00:11:37	00:11:40	I got to the end of my road.
183	00:11:40	00:11:45	And? Well, the suspect started shooting near the intersection of Jefferson and Desert Springs.
184	00:11:45	00:11:49	That's nearly 20 blocks north of the crime scene.
185	00:11:49	00:11:52	All ammo evidence was 7.62-millimeter casings and bullets.
186	00:11:52	00:11:54	Only AK ammo?
187	00:11:54	00:11:56	No police cartridge cases or bullets?
188	00:11:56	00:11:58	Not one out of 233 items.
189	00:11:58	00:12:02	But cops don't get to shoot car-to-car, only bad guys do, right?
190	00:12:05	00:12:07	Oh, hey, Greg. Been on vacation?
191	00:12:08	00:12:13	Look, I know the undersheriff's on your back, so I figured I better get to you quick.
192	00:12:13	00:12:14	Okay, you got to me.
193	00:12:14	00:12:21	Found red clay chips and dust in the gouges on Ricardo Estevez's .45.
194	00:12:21	00:12:24	He was the guy that was in the east alley with Brass.
195	00:12:24	00:12:26	Red clay chips?
196	00:12:26	00:12:28	Traces consistent with roof tiles and clay pots.
197	00:12:29	00:12:30	Who keeps their gun in a clay pot?
198	00:12:30	00:12:32	That would be no one.
199	00:12:32	00:12:37	Trace evidence is fresh, so it definitely came from the alley.
200	00:12:37	00:12:40	In a crisis, you can always count on me.
201	00:12:43	00:12:45	Doesn't he bug you?
202	00:12:45	00:12:48	No more so than anyone else around here.
203	00:13:18	00:13:21	Sara, will you come with me to the east alley, please?
204	00:13:21	00:13:26	I thought my top priority as per the undersheriff was finding the bullet that went through Bell.
205	00:13:26	00:13:27	Well, this is per me.
206	00:13:27	00:13:29	Come on. It'll be fun.
207	00:13:29	00:13:30	Okay.
208	00:13:44	00:13:46	Sara? Yeah?
209	00:13:46	00:13:48	Call Hodges at the lab.
210	00:13:48	00:13:51	Have him bring two exemplar .45s out here.
211	00:13:51	00:13:54	I'll get Ortega to bring Brass and Sergeant Carroll.
212	00:13:54	00:13:57	Are... you gonna tell me what's going on?
213	00:13:57	00:14:00	What goes up... must come down.
214	00:14:05	00:14:12	So, where exactly was Estevez standing when you guys saw him? Right there, facing this way. That's right.
215	00:14:12	00:14:15	And he had a gun in his hand. He had a gun in his hand.
216	00:14:15	00:14:18	And I shot a, uh, armed suspect who'd been shooting at the police, sir.
217	00:14:18	00:14:19	I believe you.
218	00:14:19	00:14:22	But the witnesses may also be right.
219	00:14:22	00:14:25	Look, don't make this some intellectual exercise for your own personal amusement.
220	00:14:26	00:14:28	Check it out. Hodges, stand over here.
221	00:14:28	00:14:29	Yes, sir.
222	00:14:29	00:14:30	Right here.
223	00:14:30	00:14:32	See that roof?
224	00:14:34	00:14:35	It's red clay.
225	00:14:35	00:14:38	Toss one of the guns up there.
226	00:14:38	00:14:41	Actually, they're Bobby Dawson's guns.
227	00:14:41	00:14:45	He made me sign for them-- I'm sure he wouldn't appreciate if we brought them back damaged.
228	00:14:45	00:14:48	Technically, they're myguns-- so toss one up there.
229	00:14:51	00:14:54	Just for the record, I've never really been good at sports.
230	00:14:54	00:14:55	Sara?
231	00:14:55	00:14:57	Yeah.
232	00:15:09	00:15:11	How does that prove the guy tossed the gun up there?
233	00:15:12	00:15:13	You recovered it from the ground.
234	00:15:13	00:15:15	There's a cracked tile up on the roof.
235	00:15:15	00:15:20	I found a series of scratches stretching from the cracked tile to the end of the roof.
236	00:15:20	00:15:23	I found scratches and red clay dust in the suspect's .45.
237	00:15:23	00:15:31	It explains how the witnesses could see Estevez with his hands up, and Sergeant Carroll then saw him with a gun in his hand.
238	00:15:32	00:15:34	The gun's still up there.
239	00:15:36	00:15:38	Sara...
240	00:15:38	00:15:40	try it again.
241	00:15:46	00:15:47	Stop! Police!
242	00:15:47	00:15:48	Get down!
243	00:15:48	00:15:49	Don't move.
244	00:16:06	00:16:08	There you have it.
245	00:16:08	00:16:11	There's the Geo Metro.
246	00:16:11	00:16:14	There's the Buick Regal.
247	00:16:14	00:16:17	Oh, she's pregnant, all right.
248	00:16:17	00:16:20	Doesn't look like she wants to go with him.
249	00:16:20	00:16:24	He's not giving her much choice.
250	00:16:24	00:16:28	So, just how bad was the meeting with the undersheriff?
251	00:16:28	00:16:31	Worse than the dentist.
252	00:16:31	00:16:33	Better than the proctologist.
253	00:16:33	00:16:34	Mm.
254	00:16:35	00:16:37	What's he doing?
255	00:16:37	00:16:39	Looks like he's pulling out a hide-a-key.
256	00:16:43	00:16:45	Means the car was waiting for them.
257	00:16:45	00:16:50	Whatever they were about to do, they weren't going to do it in the Metro.
258	00:16:58	00:17:00	Hey, Nick? Hey.
259	00:17:00	00:17:02	Have you checked the inside of the wheel wells?
260	00:17:02	00:17:04	No. I was having too much fun in here.
261	00:17:04	00:17:06	Oh, yeah, I can see that.
262	00:17:06	00:17:12	Um, well... since you're already dirty, would you mind checking out the left rear one for me?
263	00:17:12	00:17:14	Yeah, sure. Thank you.
264	00:17:16	00:17:18	What are you looking for?
265	00:17:18	00:17:22	I am looking for something to hide a key in.
266	00:17:22	00:17:30	Okay. Although, most hide-a-keys are held on with a magnet, which would've been demagnetized by the heat of the gasoline fire.
267	00:17:30	00:17:32	Right.
268	00:17:32	00:17:37	Nope. Well, it probably fell off at the location.
269	00:17:37	00:17:41	Maybe. Auto transport usually sweeps up the debris.
270	00:17:41	00:17:44	Good luck with that.
271	00:19:16	00:19:20	My son was riding his bike to school.
272	00:19:20	00:19:22	Today he's in a coma.
273	00:19:22	00:19:41	But when he wakes up, when he... opens his eyes again and smiles at his mother, he will see all the... flowers and cards that he's been sent from total strangers wishing him well and...
274	00:19:41	00:19:44	praying for his recovery.
275	00:19:44	00:19:48	Sheriff Burdick h-hasn't called.
276	00:19:48	00:19:51	I've left so many messages I've lost count.
277	00:19:51	00:19:57	It's inconvenient, I know, but I have questions.
278	00:19:57	00:19:59	Who did this to my son?
279	00:19:59	00:20:02	Why did they do it?
280	00:20:03	00:20:05	No one wants to answer me?
281	00:20:05	00:20:08	If the cops didn't shoot him, why won't they talk to me?
282	00:20:08	00:20:15	If I have to go to court to find out, if I have to sue each and every officer involved, I'll do it.
283	00:20:15	00:20:20	I will put the sheriff in front of a jury and get my answers there.
284	00:20:25	00:20:26	McKeen.
285	00:20:26	00:20:29	Yes, sir. I saw the news.
286	00:20:29	00:20:35	I still think we should wait to issue a statement, at least until the lab has something concrete.
287	00:20:35	00:20:38	Hodges, it's not so much that these guns are my babies, okay?
288	00:20:38	00:20:48	It's just that in order to replace them, I got to go to Property, got to locate another gun, fill out all that paperwork, so all I'm saying is, I would appreciate not being left out of the loop, okay?
289	00:20:48	00:20:49	I'm only a soldier in this war.
290	00:20:49	00:20:51	The general gave me an order, and I followed it.
291	00:20:51	00:20:54	Whatever.
292	00:20:54	00:20:55	I've finished checking this batch for trace.
293	00:20:55	00:20:59	Bobby, police said they entered my cartridge case from the sniper into IBIS.
294	00:20:59	00:21:03	It has become my priority, or so I was informed by Under Sheriff McKeen-- give me about an hour?
295	00:21:04	00:21:05	Okay.
296	00:21:17	00:21:18	I got blood.
297	00:21:19	00:21:21	Where's it from?
298	00:21:21	00:21:25	Expended bullet, Torres house, candle in the living room. That's our through-and-through.
299	00:21:25	00:21:31	Looks like a copper-jacketed nine-millimeter, consistent with cop ammo.
300	00:21:39	00:21:43	Brass, Sofia, Adams, Davis and Carroll were all shooting nines.
301	00:21:44	00:21:45	Compare it with their firearms ASAP.
302	00:21:45	00:21:47	I'm gonna go tell Grissom.
303	00:21:54	00:21:56	Looking for something?
304	00:21:57	00:22:00	At least this car still has a nice hubcap.
305	00:22:00	00:22:02	Where'd you find that?
306	00:22:02	00:22:05	On the pursuit route, Jefferson, about ten blocks north of Third.
307	00:22:05	00:22:09	Well, I've been through this car twice.
308	00:22:09	00:22:12	There's no evidence of cartridge casings, blood, drugs of any kind.
309	00:22:13	00:22:17	So there was nothing here to begin with, They cleaned it out pretty good before they torched it.
310	00:22:17	00:22:19	Hey, Nick, Grissom.
311	00:22:19	00:22:21	We found the through- and-through bullet.
312	00:22:21	00:22:22	Bobby's doing a comparison.
313	00:22:22	00:22:24	I sent a sample of blood to DNA.
314	00:22:31	00:22:33	Hey.
315	00:22:37	00:22:38	I'm glad you called.
316	00:22:38	00:22:39	I've been thinking about you.
317	00:22:39	00:22:41	Good. Yeah, I wasn't sure.
318	00:22:43	00:22:44	How you doing?
319	00:22:46	00:22:48	I've gone a little crazy.
320	00:22:48	00:22:50	Yeah. It's the waiting.
321	00:22:52	00:23:00	You know, I've been suspended or disciplined like six or seven times, and it's always the same, the waiting.
322	00:23:00	00:23:05	What you never forget is that you know, a police officer lost his life.
323	00:23:10	00:23:14	I have seen it so many times, I don't know if it's real or not.
324	00:23:15	00:23:21	Jim, it's like he's looking at me-- like as if he... as if he knew.
325	00:23:21	00:23:24	Sofia, you got to get it out of your head; that's poison.
326	00:23:24	00:23:27	You telling me you're not thinking about it?
327	00:23:27	00:23:29	Oh, I'm thinking; I'm thinking about a lot of stuff.
328	00:23:46	00:23:47	Let me tell you something.
329	00:23:47	00:23:53	You know, when I was a young cop in Jersey, there was this kid-- responded to an all shots fired.
330	00:23:53	00:23:55	Never got a radio call, never knew what hit him.
331	00:23:55	00:23:59	I was the first officer on the scene-- a patrolman, too.
332	00:23:59	00:24:02	You know, it tore up the department pretty good.
333	00:24:02	00:24:05	Everybody was all twisted and...
334	00:24:05	00:24:09	but we managed somehow to...
335	00:24:09	00:24:11	I don't know, get through it, some way.
336	00:24:15	00:24:16	Who shot him?
337	00:24:18	00:24:20	It really doesn't matter.
338	00:24:24	00:24:26	It does matter.
339	00:24:28	00:24:34	I could see Bell's face when I was shooting him, which means I was... I was shooting near him.
340	00:24:34	00:24:35	I made a mistake.
341	00:24:35	00:24:36	I shouldn't have fired.
342	00:24:36	00:24:38	No, come on. It was chaos.
343	00:24:38	00:24:39	You were just responding to a situation.
344	00:24:39	00:24:41	It was instinct, it was training.
345	00:24:41	00:24:43	No.
346	00:24:43	00:24:44	Don't, don't think that way.
347	00:24:59	00:25:03	I'm always going to be the cop who shot a cop.
348	00:25:07	00:25:09	There's the green Geo Metro.
349	00:25:09	00:25:11	Okay, you come with me.
350	00:25:11	00:25:12	You two cover the back.
351	00:25:12	00:25:13	Stay with her.
352	00:25:20	00:25:21	Police! We have a search warrant! Open up!
353	00:25:24	00:25:25	Hey!
354	00:25:26	00:25:28	Suspect on the run!
355	00:25:42	00:25:45	He's gonna meet you here. Come on. Let's go.
356	00:25:45	00:25:46	We have her, Detective.
357	00:25:46	00:25:49	Wow. You had the baby and got your figure back in one day.
358	00:25:49	00:25:50	That's impossible.
359	00:25:50	00:25:51	Believe me, I know.
360	00:25:51	00:25:52	My wife's had five kids.
361	00:25:56	00:25:58	Oh, Tina, baby-- no.
362	00:25:58	00:26:01	Peanut butter without the jelly?
363	00:26:01	00:26:04	She's trying to get me to cut down on sugar.
364	00:26:04	00:26:05	but this is ridiculous.
365	00:26:05	00:26:07	Here.
366	00:26:07	00:26:09	Thanks.
367	00:26:11	00:26:12	Do you ever want to be a cop?
368	00:26:12	00:26:14	Every time I get a speeding ticket, yeah.
369	00:26:14	00:26:19	No, I mean like guns and car chases and Put your back against the wall, that kind of stuff.
370	00:26:19	00:26:23	No, I prefer the scientific side of law enforcement.
371	00:26:23	00:26:24	Me, too.
372	00:26:30	00:26:31	Brown.
373	00:26:31	00:26:33	Hey, Catherine.
374	00:26:33	00:26:34	We got the couple driving the Buick.
375	00:26:34	00:26:36	Female wasn't pregnant.
376	00:26:36	00:26:37	She was a mule.
377	00:26:37	00:26:38	Really.
378	00:26:38	00:26:47	Found her rig for transporting narco inside the house, and unless these guys were in the mail order business, I think they were being shipped drugs.
379	00:26:47	00:26:50	And delivering them to the guys up the food chain.
380	00:26:50	00:26:51	Yeah.
381	00:26:51	00:26:54	You think these are the same guys who whacked Fausto?
382	00:26:54	00:26:56	It's the best lead we've got.
383	00:26:58	00:27:01	You were a passenger in a stolen vehicle that failed to yield to the police.
384	00:27:01	00:27:08	We've also connected you to a drug ring which was responsible for the death of a police officer.
385	00:27:10	00:27:11	Miss Guerro?
386	00:27:14	00:27:17	You're looking at prison time, so think about it.
387	00:27:17	00:27:21	Whatever you could tell us about these guys will be in your best interest.
388	00:27:25	00:27:32	Surveillance footage from Angie's Donut Shop shows you carrying drugs and getting into the delivery car.
389	00:27:33	00:27:35	That alone gets you ten years.
390	00:27:36	00:27:40	Okay, this is your last chance for your client to help herself out.
391	00:27:49	00:27:51	You don't understand. We had no choice.
392	00:27:51	00:27:52	They would have killed us.
393	00:27:52	00:27:53	Who would've killed you?
394	00:27:53	00:27:57	There is nothing that you can do to me that is worse than what they can do.
395	00:28:01	00:28:02	I'm done.
396	00:28:02	00:28:03	I'm not talking no more.
397	00:28:03	00:28:05	Mr. Contranos has served time for narcotics possession.
398	00:28:06	00:28:09	He's been deported three times for entering the country illegally.
399	00:28:09	00:28:11	This time, we're going to throw away the key.
400	00:28:11	00:28:13	Mr. Contranos has no interest in speaking to you.
401	00:28:13	00:28:17	We're talking about the difference between life without parole and the needle, here.
402	00:28:17	00:28:20	He's prepared to do his time.
403	00:28:26	00:28:30	Grissom, I managed to get a hit off of that sniper cartridge case.
404	00:28:30	00:28:33	Links up to a drug rip-off in L.A. last year-- unsolved.
405	00:28:33	00:28:35	What about the phone records from the motel?
406	00:28:35	00:28:37	Fausto made one call about an hour before he died.
407	00:28:37	00:28:40	We ran it down to a disposable mobile phone.
408	00:28:40	00:28:43	So is there anything I can tell the undersheriff?
409	00:28:43	00:28:46	Yeah. Dead end on Fausto.
410	00:28:46	00:28:47	You tell him.
411	00:29:01	00:29:03	I got your results from the blood on the bullet.
412	00:29:03	00:29:05	It definitely belongs to Officer Bell.
413	00:29:08	00:29:11	This is my first deceased police officer.
414	00:29:11	00:29:13	I heard that his wife is pregnant.
415	00:29:13	00:29:16	Wendy, you understand that this is confidential.
416	00:29:16	00:29:19	Yes, sir. And you can't discuss it, even with your coworkers.
417	00:29:19	00:29:22	I understand what this means.
418	00:29:31	00:29:34	Hey. Warrick tell you about the IBIS hit?
419	00:29:34	00:29:35	Yeah.
420	00:29:35	00:29:38	How are you doing with Bell's bullet?
421	00:29:38	00:29:39	I was confirming my findings.
422	00:29:39	00:29:42	Don't want to make any mistakes.
423	00:29:42	00:29:43	Does that mean you have results?
424	00:29:44	00:29:47	The bullet has the right GRC's for a Sig-Sauer.
425	00:29:47	00:29:49	Sergeant Adams carries a Beretta.
426	00:29:49	00:29:50	Carroll, too.
427	00:29:50	00:29:52	Davis has a Glock, so that rules him out.
428	00:29:52	00:29:56	However, both detectives Brass and Curtis carry Sigs.
429	00:29:58	00:30:00	But take a look.
430	00:30:04	00:30:09	There's hardly any jacket left. Means there's almost no chance of identifying that to a specific gun.
431	00:30:09	00:30:11	What if you had more time? Could you do it?
432	00:30:11	00:30:16	Sorry, boss. I mean, there's just no way I can tell you who shot Officer Bell.
433	00:30:17	00:30:24	You know, based on the dates of these address labels, it appears that Carlos and Bianca were receiving two to three drug shipments a day.
434	00:30:24	00:30:27	So the dogs hit on the boxes?
435	00:30:27	00:30:33	Yes, and Narco found trace amounts of cocaine, for whatever that's worth.
436	00:30:33	00:30:40	Well, the return addresses are all bogus, the couple is not talking, and all four suspects are dead.
437	00:30:40	00:30:42	There's nothing more we can do.
438	00:30:53	00:30:58	Okay, Nick, the cruiser's right front tire is 19 feet, 5 inches from the south curb.
439	00:31:01	00:31:05	Sara, the detective unit's left front tire is five feet to inches from the south curb.
440	00:31:10	00:31:11	All right.
441	00:31:11	00:31:13	Nick, you be Brass.
442	00:31:13	00:31:14	Sara, you be Sofia.
443	00:31:14	00:31:16	Good.
444	00:31:16	00:31:18	I'll be Bell.
445	00:31:18	00:31:22	Officer Bell was crouched down behind his door.
446	00:31:31	00:31:34	Gris! I can't see you from here.
447	00:31:34	00:31:37	You're blocked by both cars.
448	00:31:37	00:31:38	Yeah, me either.
449	00:31:38	00:31:40	I'd have to shoot through both cars to get to you.
450	00:31:40	00:31:44	I processed them both-- no shots entered from the back.
451	00:31:46	00:31:48	Can you see me here?
452	00:31:50	00:31:53	Yeah, I can see you. Yeah, now.
453	00:31:55	00:31:57	What would make Bell stand up in the middle of a gunfight?
454	00:31:58	00:32:00	Maybe he had to change positions.
455	00:32:00	00:32:03	We know that the suspects were starting to run, right?
456	00:32:04	00:32:06	Okay, he popped up, took one in the vest.
457	00:32:08	00:32:10	Let's assume that.
458	00:32:10	00:32:17	We'll line up the exit trajectories with the apartment window, and we'll use lasers, but we may have to wait until it's dark.
459	00:32:21	00:32:23	We're turning on the lasers.
460	00:32:23	00:32:25	Is the candle in position?
461	00:32:25	00:32:28	Ready on this end.
462	00:32:28	00:32:30	Let me know when the beam hits the candle.
463	00:32:30	00:32:31	Good to go!
464	00:32:38	00:32:40	Uh... good height.
465	00:32:40	00:32:42	Move it six inches to the left.
466	00:32:42	00:32:44	Six inches to the left.
467	00:32:47	00:32:49	Oh, no, no. My left.
468	00:32:49	00:32:51	He meant the other left.
469	00:33:00	00:33:01	Right there.
470	00:33:01	00:33:02	Perfect.
471	00:33:02	00:33:04	I'll call you back.
472	00:33:04	00:33:06	Okay, we got the exit.
473	00:33:06	00:33:08	Now we need the entrance.
474	00:33:08	00:33:09	Sara, turn your laser on.
475	00:33:14	00:33:16	The path of my laser is off.
476	00:33:16	00:33:17	Yeah, it's a bad angle.
477	00:33:17	00:33:19	Move it to the left.
478	00:33:21	00:33:23	Gris... Hmm?
479	00:33:23	00:33:25	It's blocked by the car.
480	00:33:25	00:33:27	It's not possible.
481	00:33:27	00:33:29	Turn it off.
482	00:33:29	00:33:31	Nick, turn yours on.
483	00:33:31	00:33:33	Mine's been on the whole time.
484	00:33:33	00:33:35	It's still blocked.
485	00:33:40	00:33:41	Raise it up.
486	00:34:03	00:34:05	He stood up.
487	00:34:34	00:34:36	Well, your call was a little cryptic.
488	00:34:36	00:34:40	Must've got the results from the ballistics test.
489	00:34:40	00:34:46	We did, but it was inconclusive, so I went back to the intersection and ran a reconstruction.
490	00:34:46	00:34:48	Well, I don't know how you reconstruct a war zone.
491	00:34:48	00:34:50	You have no idea what it was like.
492	00:34:50	00:34:52	I mean, it was a fire fight.
493	00:34:54	00:34:56	Have you talked to Sofia?
494	00:34:58	00:35:01	It wasn't Sofia.
495	00:35:05	00:35:07	You must have stood up...
496	00:35:07	00:35:10	fired at the suspects over the black and whites.
497	00:35:10	00:35:14	Officer Bell stood up at the same time, right into your line of fire.
498	00:35:14	00:35:17	Fausto shot him in the vest, which spun him a little.
499	00:35:17	00:35:20	At the same time, you hit him in the neck.
500	00:35:22	00:35:27	( sighs ) Oh, I-I swear, I was behind the car, I...
501	00:35:27	00:35:29	I-I stood up?
502	00:35:34	00:35:39	Sheriff wants me to present our findings at a community meeting in an hour.
503	00:35:47	00:35:49	Don't keep 'em waiting.
504	00:36:03	00:36:08	I just received a report from the Shooting Review Board.
505	00:36:10	00:36:12	You've been cleared.
506	00:36:16	00:36:19	You can go back to work.
507	00:36:22	00:36:24	Thank you.
508	00:36:36	00:36:39	Hello. My name is Dr. Gil Grissom.
509	00:36:39	00:36:45	I'm the night shift supervisor for the Las Vegas Police Department's Crime Lab.
510	00:36:45	00:36:48	( murmuring fades ) I'm not a police officer; I'm a scientist.
511	00:36:48	00:36:50	You work for the cops. That makes you a cop.
512	00:36:50	00:36:51	You're not on our side.
513	00:36:58	00:37:00	Actually, I'm a forensics expert.
514	00:37:00	00:37:10	( murmuring fades ) My job is to identify, collect, and examine physical evidence from a crime scene, to determine who did what to whom and how did they do it.
515	00:37:10	00:37:18	I've been asked to come here today by the mayor and Sheriff Burdick to present our analysis of the evidence in this case to your community.
516	00:37:18	00:37:21	Why aren't they here? Why should we believe your evidence?
517	00:37:24	00:37:27	Physical evidence cannot be wrong.
518	00:37:27	00:37:28	It doesn't lie.
519	00:37:29	00:37:32	It's not influenced by emotion or prejudice. ( murmuring fades )
520	00:37:32	00:37:36	It's... it's not confused by the excitement of the moment.
521	00:37:36	00:37:45	I'm here, in God's house, to explain to you the truth about exactly what happened the other day.
522	00:37:46	00:37:50	I'd like to start by showing you some photos.
523	00:37:50	00:37:57	This is a bullet that was recovered from the Kevlar vest of Officer Daniel Bell, now deceased.
524	00:37:57	00:37:59	What about my son?
525	00:37:59	00:38:03	What-What does the evidence say about my son?
526	00:38:05	00:38:07	Okay, if you like, we can start there.
527	00:38:07	00:38:09	Please.
528	00:38:11	00:38:14	This photo is a comparison of two cartridge cases.
529	00:38:14	00:38:17	The one on the right was found next to your son.
530	00:38:17	00:38:23	The one on the left was test-fired from Jose Fausto's pistol.
531	00:38:23	00:38:30	As you can see, there are corresponding individual marks on both cartridges.
532	00:38:30	00:38:33	These are unique, like fingerprints.
533	00:38:33	00:38:37	It means that they were fired from the same gun.
534	00:38:37	00:38:41	It proves that while attempting to escape from the police...
535	00:38:41	00:38:45	Jose Fausto shot your son Geraldo in the back.
536	00:38:45	00:38:46	Why would he do that?
537	00:38:48	00:38:52	We recovered your son's bicycle from Jose Fausto's motel room.
538	00:38:52	00:38:55	Your son was on his way to football practice.
539	00:38:58	00:39:05	It appears that Jose Fausto shot your son so he could use his bike.
540	00:39:53	00:39:57	Jim, I was just on my way out, but if you want me to stay...
541	00:39:57	00:39:59	No, I-I think I can handle it. I think.
542	00:39:59	00:40:01	Thanks. Okay.
543	00:40:48	00:40:52	The Shooting Review Board wants to talk to you.
544	00:40:52	00:40:59	You're going to have to explain your tactical decision for shooting in the direction of a fellow officer.
545	00:40:59	00:41:03	I'm ready when they are.
546	00:41:03	00:41:06	As far as I'm concerned, there's no question...
547	00:41:06	00:41:09	it was a bad shoot.
548	00:41:13	00:41:15	I'll have to live with that.
549	00:41:37	00:41:39	( chuckles ) Oh, whoa!
550	00:41:40	00:41:43	Hey. What's your name?
551	00:41:43	00:41:45	Jeannie. Well, that's a pretty name.
552	00:41:48	00:41:49	Is that your mom over there?
553	00:41:49	00:41:52	Huh? Okay, be careful, Jeannie...
554	00:42:32	00:42:35	Mrs. Bell... I'm Jim Brass.
555	00:42:35	00:42:38	I know.
556	00:42:40	00:42:43	I want you to know... if there's, um...
557	00:42:43	00:42:45	if there's any, um...
558	00:42:57	00:43:00	I know it wasn't your fault.
559	00:43:04	00:43:07	I... I'm...
560	00:43:07	00:43:09	I'm so sorry.
