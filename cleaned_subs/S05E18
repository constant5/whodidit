0	00:01:48	00:01:50	Local homeowner called it in early.
1	00:01:51	00:01:53	We got it contained pretty quick.
2	00:01:53	00:01:55	We were lucky. ( camera clicks )
3	00:01:55	00:01:57	Luckier than he was.
4	00:01:59	00:02:01	Low humidity, dry brush.
5	00:02:01	00:02:03	Perfect conditions for maximum damage.
6	00:02:03	00:02:06	Firebugs listen to the weather reports just like we do.
7	00:02:06	00:02:08	Only for different reasons.
8	00:02:08	00:02:11	Maybe some moron just threw a cigarette out the car window.
9	00:02:11	00:02:12	You're an optimist.
10	00:02:14	00:02:15	Do you have a point of origin?
11	00:02:15	00:02:16	Not yet...
12	00:02:16	00:02:18	Fire spread down the slope.
13	00:02:18	00:02:21	Probably started along top of the ridge.
14	00:02:21	00:02:23	I'll give you a shout when it's safe to come up.
15	00:02:23	00:02:24	Okay, Mom.
16	00:02:26	00:02:31	This area was always a good place for stargazing.
17	00:02:31	00:02:34	It's a good make-out spot, too. So I've heard.
18	00:03:07	00:03:09	Sara!
19	00:03:09	00:03:13	We've got another body down here.
20	00:03:13	00:03:16	Get the paramedics!
21	00:03:48	00:03:52	Dr. Forrest, dial 102, please. Dr. Forrest...
22	00:03:57	00:03:59	I'm Greg Sanders from the Crime Lab.
23	00:03:59	00:04:01	I'm here to collect trace from the arson victim.
24	00:04:01	00:04:02	She was in the burn unit.
25	00:04:02	00:04:03	Bay number three.
26	00:04:04	00:04:05	Thanks.
27	00:04:37	00:04:38	I thought...
28	00:04:38	00:04:42	I just assumed she was dead.
29	00:04:42	00:04:44	It's a miracle she's not.
30	00:04:44	00:04:46	This is as bad as it gets.
31	00:04:46	00:04:49	How extensive are the burns?
32	00:04:49	00:04:51	80 percent.
33	00:04:51	00:04:54	Mostly third degree.
34	00:04:54	00:04:57	I hope the morphine's working.
35	00:04:57	00:04:59	Third degree burns are painless.
36	00:04:59	00:05:00	The nerves are burned away.
37	00:05:00	00:05:04	She's not conscious of what's happening to her.
38	00:05:04	00:05:06	Not now.
39	00:05:06	00:05:08	She's still a Jane Doe.
40	00:05:08	00:05:14	I'm going to need all of her clothes, as well as any trace off her body.
41	00:05:14	00:05:16	We'll save whatever we find during debridement.
42	00:05:16	00:05:18	Debridement?
43	00:05:18	00:05:22	We scrape off the dead flesh, then cover it with cadaver skin.
44	00:05:22	00:05:23	We then wrap it with gauze.
45	00:05:23	00:05:26	It prevents infection and allows the remaining tissue to heal.
46	00:05:38	00:05:41	She's gonna lose those fingers.
47	00:05:47	00:05:49	Continue chest compressions and manual oxygen.
48	00:05:49	00:05:52	Giving her Atropine and epi via I.V.
49	00:05:52	00:05:54	ETA to Palm Desert-- eight minutes.
50	00:05:54	00:05:55	Just going through the motions.
51	00:05:55	00:05:58	Kid's name is Dani Stewart; she's five.
52	00:05:58	00:06:03	Neighbors saw her floating facedown in the pool from their second-story balcony, called 911.
53	00:06:03	00:06:04	Why didn't they pull her out?
54	00:06:04	00:06:05	They couldn't get in the backyard gate.
55	00:06:05	00:06:07	Childproof lock.
56	00:06:07	00:06:08	No key, no access.
57	00:06:09	00:06:10	Parents protected that kid to death.
58	00:06:10	00:06:11	Where the hell were they?
59	00:06:13	00:06:14	Home.
60	00:06:20	00:06:22	We'll call you, Dave, when we clear a path.
61	00:06:22	00:06:25	Okay.
62	00:07:07	00:07:09	Oh, man.
63	00:07:23	00:07:26	Whew.
64	00:07:26	00:07:28	Well...
65	00:07:29	00:07:31	She obviously fell forward...
66	00:07:31	00:07:33	As she ran down the stairs.
67	00:07:39	00:07:41	Lots of pictures of the kid.
68	00:07:41	00:07:44	Family revolved around the child, huh?
69	00:07:44	00:07:46	Yeah, way it should be.
70	00:07:51	00:07:53	Struggle?
71	00:07:57	00:07:59	She might have put her hand out to break her fall.
72	00:08:16	00:08:19	Man.
73	00:08:19	00:08:21	What a scene.
74	00:08:38	00:08:39	What are you thinking?
75	00:08:39	00:08:43	Maybe murder-suicide.
76	00:08:51	00:08:53	I don't know.
77	00:08:53	00:08:56	This gun looks like it might've been wiped clean.
78	00:08:56	00:08:58	You thinking professional hit?
79	00:09:08	00:09:11	What about the little girl?
80	00:09:11	00:09:13	Loose end.
81	00:09:15	00:09:17	Mommy, why is everybody screaming?
82	00:09:17	00:09:21	There are three bodies in three locations.
83	00:09:21	00:09:22	A lot of variables.
84	00:09:23	00:09:25	Where do you want to start?
85	00:10:06	00:10:09	I've got...
86	00:10:09	00:10:12	the business end of a disposable lighter.
87	00:10:12	00:10:14	Could be an ignition source.
88	00:10:23	00:10:25	Hey.
89	00:10:25	00:10:27	What's that?
90	00:10:38	00:10:40	Possible accelerant.
91	00:10:40	00:10:42	Or possible martini.
92	00:10:48	00:10:50	I didn't think you could smell vodka.
93	00:10:51	00:10:54	Well, that depends on how long it was distilled.
94	00:10:54	00:10:55	Cheap stuff.
95	00:10:55	00:11:01	Ironically, the word for vodka comes from the Russian phrase zhizennia voda.
96	00:11:02	00:11:04	Water of life.
97	00:11:19	00:11:20	Hey.
98	00:11:20	00:11:22	Hey, Super Dave.
99	00:11:22	00:11:25	You have any idea when I might be able to process the bodies?
100	00:11:25	00:11:26	Uh...
101	00:11:26	00:11:28	That'd be a question for the boss lady.
102	00:11:28	00:11:30	She's upstairs to the right.
103	00:11:30	00:11:31	Thanks.
104	00:11:43	00:11:45	I've got some long hairs on the pillow-- brunette.
105	00:11:46	00:11:47	Wife was a blonde.
106	00:11:47	00:11:49	So was the daughter, right? Yeah.
107	00:11:51	00:11:53	Well, I'll collect the sheets as soon as I'm finished up here.
108	00:11:53	00:11:58	Hey, Catherine, um, I was wondering if I... Oh, I'm sorry, David.
109	00:11:58	00:12:01	We're going need to keep the bodies in their original position for a while longer.
110	00:12:01	00:12:06	Crime scene this messy, gotta bust out the big guns, you know what I mean?
111	00:12:09	00:12:14	Hey, did you know that Ecklie volunteered the lab to evaluate this scanner for Third Tech?
112	00:12:14	00:12:15	I'm sure he's hoping they'll give us one for free.
113	00:12:15	00:12:17	I wouldn't count on it.
114	00:12:17	00:12:21	But I am definitely going to enjoy using this while it's here.
115	00:12:21	00:12:22	Virtual crime scene sketch.
116	00:12:22	00:12:24	Sure beats doing it by hand.
117	00:12:39	00:12:43	The whole family...
118	00:12:43	00:12:45	dead?
119	00:12:45	00:12:49	Dani, too?
120	00:12:51	00:12:54	She just had her birthday.
121	00:12:54	00:12:58	How long have you been Morgan Stewart's assistant?
122	00:12:58	00:13:00	Uh...
123	00:13:00	00:13:03	about two years now.
124	00:13:03	00:13:05	Did you and Morgan ever see each other outside of work?
125	00:13:05	00:13:07	Well...
126	00:13:07	00:13:11	I baby-sat Dani sometimes for some extra cash.
127	00:13:11	00:13:12	I'm putting myself through school.
128	00:13:12	00:13:15	We found a brown hair in his bed.
129	00:13:15	00:13:17	Your color.
130	00:13:17	00:13:27	I wasn't sleeping with Morgan, and if you knew him, you wouldn't bother implying it.
131	00:13:27	00:13:30	He was devoted to his wife.
132	00:13:31	00:13:33	He was a...
133	00:13:33	00:13:35	He was a wonderful father.
134	00:13:35	00:13:37	Hmm.
135	00:13:37	00:13:39	Were you ever in his bedroom?
136	00:13:39	00:13:41	( scoffs ) No.
137	00:13:41	00:13:45	Then you wouldn't mind giving us a sample of your hair.
138	00:13:45	00:13:48	No. Be glad to...
139	00:13:48	00:13:50	as soon as you show me a court order.
140	00:13:50	00:13:51	You know how that makes you look?
141	00:13:51	00:13:53	Save it.
142	00:13:53	00:13:54	I'm pre-law.
143	00:14:18	00:14:20	I hear our victim is still alive.
144	00:14:20	00:14:22	I don't see why.
145	00:14:22	00:14:26	Well, she's not ready to let go yet.
146	00:14:26	00:14:28	Some kind of melted card.
147	00:14:28	00:14:32	I found traces of alcohol all over her clothes.
148	00:14:32	00:14:34	She was doused in it.
149	00:14:34	00:14:38	The accelerant and the probable ignition source were found at the top of the hill.
150	00:14:39	00:14:40	That was the point of origin.
151	00:14:40	00:14:45	But the victim was found, almost completely burned, at the bottom of the hill.
152	00:14:47	00:14:51	I don't think she was caught in the fire...
153	00:14:54	00:14:56	I think she started it.
154	00:15:25	00:15:29	I got a work card hit off the vodka bottle-- a Patrick Bromley.
155	00:15:29	00:15:30	He used to bus tables at the Palms.
156	00:15:30	00:15:33	These days, he's driving a big rig.
157	00:15:33	00:15:34	He's a trucker.
158	00:15:34	00:15:35	he's on the road.
159	00:15:35	00:15:37	According to his employer, yes.
160	00:15:37	00:15:40	Vartann is working at bringing him in.
161	00:15:40	00:15:51	But, as it turns out, the company tracks its drivers via GPS, and they were kind enough-- under threat of subpoena-- to give me access to Mr. Bromley's route data for the last 24 hours.
162	00:15:54	00:15:55	And what do you know.
163	00:15:57	00:15:59	He was in the area of the fire an hour before the alarm went out?
164	00:16:00	00:16:07	Yes. And about a half hour before that, he made a stop at the local Gas 'N' Sip.
165	00:16:07	00:16:09	Well, see if the store's got video surveillance.
166	00:16:09	00:16:12	Done. Footage is on its way in.
167	00:16:21	00:16:26	You got my dispatcher crawling all over my ass for the past five hours.
168	00:16:26	00:16:28	You know, you pull off a route, that costs me money.
169	00:16:28	00:16:30	Hey... shut up.
170	00:16:30	00:16:33	Why don't you tell us about your friend here.
171	00:16:35	00:16:37	She's not my friend.
172	00:16:37	00:16:39	I picked her up hitching out on Sunset.
173	00:16:39	00:16:40	Did she tell you her name?
174	00:16:40	00:16:42	Never came up.
175	00:16:42	00:16:44	Where and when did you see her last?
176	00:16:44	00:16:46	Dropped her off on Blue Diamond Road.
177	00:16:47	00:16:49	In the middle of nowhere, just like that?
178	00:16:49	00:16:50	Yeah. She wanted out.
179	00:16:50	00:16:51	I bet she did.
180	00:16:52	00:16:55	Where did you get the, uh, scratches on your neck?
181	00:16:55	00:16:57	A bar fight, couple of nights ago.
182	00:16:59	00:17:01	Hey, do you mind if we look inside your truck?
183	00:17:03	00:17:05	If that's what's gonna get me back on the road.
184	00:17:47	00:17:48	Mr. Bromley!
185	00:17:48	00:17:51	Pink is not your color.
186	00:17:55	00:17:58	Look, I was just trying to help that chick out.
187	00:17:58	00:18:00	And then you helped yourself.
188	00:18:04	00:18:07	Uh-uh. Wasn't like that.
189	00:18:07	00:18:08	Are you saying you never touched her?
190	00:18:08	00:18:10	No way.
191	00:18:10	00:18:14	I mean, yeah... the girl was ready to party.
192	00:18:14	00:18:16	We had a couple drinks, and a smoke.
193	00:18:16	00:18:21	She was definitely checking me out, but I'm a happily married man.
194	00:18:21	00:18:23	I just gave her a ride.
195	00:18:25	00:18:27	We already know what you did.
196	00:18:40	00:18:43	Looks like you guys already got your answers.
197	00:18:43	00:18:45	Which means I want a lawyer.
198	00:18:46	00:18:49	Bobby matched the bullets to the gun that was found at the scene.
199	00:18:49	00:18:51	He also ran a registration check.
200	00:18:51	00:18:54	Gun was clean.
201	00:18:54	00:18:56	No, it was registered to Morgan Stewart.
202	00:18:56	00:18:59	So, what, we're looking at a murder-suicide?
203	00:18:59	00:19:01	Guy kills his family and then turns the gun on himself?
204	00:19:01	00:19:03	Well, you know it's a possibility.
205	00:19:03	00:19:04	Brass pulled his financials.
206	00:19:05	00:19:06	Morgan Stewart was in debt up to his eyeballs.
207	00:19:07	00:19:09	He was in danger of losing his house.
208	00:19:09	00:19:12	Never underestimate the fragility of the male ego.
209	00:19:13	00:19:17	Bullet enters with a marginal abrasion on the underside of the chin.
210	00:19:17	00:19:24	The wound path traverses the oral cavity, brain, and the high scalp, just right of the mid-line.
211	00:19:24	00:19:29	Bullet exited with a stellate laceration in the right parietal scalp.
212	00:19:30	00:19:33	Mrs. Stewart...
213	00:19:33	00:19:35	Bullet penetrates the back.
214	00:19:35	00:19:44	The hemorrhagic wound paths traverse the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and the deep musculature on the right side of the back.
215	00:19:44	00:19:48	Trajectory is back to front, right to left and slightly downward.
216	00:19:48	00:19:50	And what about the daughter?
217	00:20:01	00:20:03	Cause of death was drowning.
218	00:20:05	00:20:07	Any trauma to the body?
219	00:20:07	00:20:18	I noticed a fracture on the left fourth costosternal junction-- with virtually no hemorrhage-- caused by excessive pressure on the upper aspect of chest.
220	00:20:18	00:20:20	Broken rib.
221	00:20:20	00:20:22	Now, I know the paramedics performed CPR...
222	00:20:22	00:20:26	Right, but the EMTs' report states that she already had the injury when they found her at the scene.
223	00:20:30	00:20:33	So maybe this all started with the accidental death of a child.
224	00:20:43	00:20:49	Wife tells her husband, whose mental state is already hanging by a thread...
225	00:20:56	00:20:58	Eh, that works.
226	00:20:58	00:21:03	Except how do you perform CPR on your child and then toss her back into the pool?
227	00:21:03	00:21:05	Did you get an I.D. on our arson victim yet?
228	00:21:06	00:21:09	I ran the DNA through CODIS and Missing Persons, and I came up empty.
229	00:21:09	00:21:13	But one thing I do know is that one of her markers is out of the control range.
230	00:21:13	00:21:14	Off-ladder peak?
231	00:21:14	00:21:19	You talk the talk, but did you know the frequency of that anomaly is one in every 250?
232	00:21:19	00:21:22	I learn something new every day around here.
233	00:21:57	00:21:59	Mr. Matthews...
234	00:21:59	00:22:00	when was the last time you saw your wife?
235	00:22:00	00:22:03	Last night, about 6 She hasn't been home since?
236	00:22:03	00:22:06	No.
237	00:22:06	00:22:08	We had a fight, she left.
238	00:22:08	00:22:09	It's happened before.
239	00:22:09	00:22:11	Do you have a lot of fights?
240	00:22:12	00:22:13	I don't know; what's a lot?
241	00:22:13	00:22:17	Look, things have been a little rough for us lately.
242	00:22:17	00:22:20	Tara's been on anti-depressants for awhile.
243	00:22:21	00:22:23	I own my own business, so she's home most of the time.
244	00:22:24	00:22:26	What's this all about? Where's my wife?
245	00:22:28	00:22:30	She's been in an accident.
246	00:22:33	00:22:35	I want to see her.
247	00:22:50	00:22:52	I don't know who that is, but...
248	00:22:52	00:22:54	that's not my wife. That's not Tara.
249	00:22:56	00:22:57	Is this her ring?
250	00:23:03	00:23:05	Oh, my God.
251	00:23:08	00:23:09	Tara.
252	00:23:17	00:23:18	How did this happen?
253	00:23:19	00:23:22	We're still investigating.
254	00:23:25	00:23:28	All day...
255	00:23:28	00:23:30	I've been waiting for her to get home.
256	00:23:32	00:23:34	I was really going to make it up to her.
257	00:23:51	00:23:54	How'd it go at the hospital?
258	00:23:54	00:23:57	About as well as could be expected.
259	00:23:57	00:24:00	Doctors had to amputate the fingers from her right hand.
260	00:24:00	00:24:02	Too great a risk for infection.
261	00:24:02	00:24:06	They gave them to me to process for trace.
262	00:24:06	00:24:08	You've pulled a double, Greg.
263	00:24:08	00:24:09	You need a break.
264	00:24:09	00:24:10	I'll process it.
265	00:24:15	00:24:16	Thanks.
266	00:24:54	00:24:56	Hey.
267	00:24:56	00:24:58	Hey.
268	00:25:01	00:25:02	What's the problem?
269	00:25:02	00:25:04	Nothing. I'm fine.
270	00:25:06	00:25:08	You're not.
271	00:25:09	00:25:12	I feel like a wuss.
272	00:25:12	00:25:17	Grissom told me I should take a break, and I did.
273	00:25:18	00:25:19	Your burn victim.
274	00:25:21	00:25:23	How do you get an image like that out of your mind?
275	00:25:23	00:25:24	You go home.
276	00:25:24	00:25:26	You, uh...
277	00:25:26	00:25:29	hug your cat, your dog, your pillow.
278	00:25:29	00:25:32	You have a beer, you watch a movie, and then you come back tomorrow.
279	00:25:32	00:25:35	Is that supposed to make me feel better?
280	00:25:35	00:25:38	Rumor has it you used to be a pretty funny guy.
281	00:25:40	00:25:42	Don't lose that.
282	00:26:24	00:26:27	It's hard to look and not touch, isn't it?
283	00:26:27	00:26:29	That poor kid has been working her tail off.
284	00:26:29	00:26:34	Only fair, considering how DNA gets most of the glory these days.
285	00:26:34	00:26:36	Have something for me?
286	00:26:36	00:26:37	Of course.
287	00:26:38	00:26:43	The dark hairs you found on Morgan Stewart's bed were not a match to his wife.
288	00:26:43	00:26:46	Pretty bold, to bring another woman into his matrimonial bed.
289	00:26:46	00:26:47	Begging to get caught.
290	00:26:47	00:26:50	Well, so far, you haven't told me anything I didn't already know.
291	00:26:50	00:26:54	This is the broken glass and paper found on the floor of the master bedroom.
292	00:26:54	00:26:56	Uh, looks like a thermometer.
293	00:26:56	00:26:57	Yes, but what kind?
294	00:26:57	00:26:59	Do tell.
295	00:26:59	00:27:02	Notice how the gradations are broken down by tenths of a degree?
296	00:27:02	00:27:03	Yes.
297	00:27:03	00:27:05	And most thermometers aren't that specific.
298	00:27:05	00:27:06	Correct.
299	00:27:06	00:27:13	It's a BBT, a basal body temperature thermometer, used by women to pinpoint a temperature spike that occurs...
300	00:27:13	00:27:15	During ovulation. I know.
301	00:27:15	00:27:18	It maximizes your chance of conception. So...
302	00:27:18	00:27:20	Corinne Stewart, I guess, was trying to have another baby.
303	00:27:20	00:27:23	With no clue as to what her husband was doing when she was out of the house.
304	00:27:24	00:27:25	Or with whom.
305	00:27:25	00:27:28	Grissom-- hey, it's about your arson victim.
306	00:27:28	00:27:29	Greg beat you to it. I got an I.D.
307	00:27:29	00:27:32	Yeah, well, I got something you don't have.
308	00:27:32	00:27:36	This is the standard ladder of alleles that I run against every unknown DNA.
309	00:27:36	00:27:40	and it contains all of the commonly encountered alleles within the population.
310	00:27:40	00:27:44	As you can see, at locus D3 the alleles are 12 through 19.
311	00:27:44	00:27:45	Which is normal.
312	00:27:45	00:27:52	Right. Now, as you can see on the sample on the bottom, the locus D3 alleles are 15 and 21.
313	00:27:52	00:27:53	Not normal.
314	00:27:53	00:27:56	The 21 allele is outside the normal range.
315	00:27:56	00:27:58	An off-ladder peak.
316	00:27:58	00:27:59	Like Tara Matthews.
317	00:27:59	00:28:00	Right.
318	00:28:00	00:28:01	This is her profile.
319	00:28:01	00:28:03	And this...
320	00:28:04	00:28:09	is the DNA that was extracted from the vaginal contribution to the sheets at the Stewart house.
321	00:28:09	00:28:13	Tara Matthews' DNA in Morgan Stewart's bed.
322	00:28:13	00:28:15	We're working the same case.
323	00:28:18	00:28:23	There were several spots of high density polyethylene embedded in the fingers of Tara Matthews' right hand.
324	00:28:23	00:28:29	According to Hodges, the material is consistent with the plastic tanks in most disposable lighters.
325	00:28:29	00:28:32	We found the top of one at the scene of the fire.
326	00:28:32	00:28:38	Well, heat melts plastic and butane will explode under pressure.
327	00:28:38	00:28:40	So the lighter blew up in her hand?
328	00:28:40	00:28:41	Are you saying that she...
329	00:28:41	00:28:43	set herself on fire?
330	00:28:52	00:28:54	It was attempted suicide.
331	00:28:54	00:28:57	She'd been assaulted by a truck driver shortly before her death.
332	00:28:57	00:28:58	She was clinically depressed.
333	00:28:58	00:29:00	She was having problems in her marriage.
334	00:29:00	00:29:04	You know, some Eastern cultures believe that fire cleanses the soul.
335	00:29:04	00:29:08	Well, Tara Matthews was having sex with Morgan Stewart.
336	00:29:08	00:29:15	So, if she attempted suicide several hours after the Stewarts died, she's a possible suspect.
337	00:29:15	00:29:19	Yeah, but just having her DNA in the bed doesn't prove she was there for the murders.
338	00:29:19	00:29:21	What about Tara's husband Neal?
339	00:29:21	00:29:25	Well, according to Brass, Neal and Morgan were good friends since they were kids.
340	00:29:25	00:29:29	Neal was good at making money, and Morgan was good at making debts.
341	00:29:29	00:29:34	Maybe Morgan was jealous of Neal, sleeps with Tara out of spite, Corinne finds out...
342	00:29:34	00:29:37	And three people end up dead.
343	00:29:37	00:29:40	So the critical question remains.
344	00:29:40	00:29:50	If Morgan shot himself, then he's the prime suspect in the murders, but if he, in fact, was murdered, then somebody else was in the house.
345	00:29:50	00:29:51	Mr. Matthews.
346	00:29:51	00:29:53	Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.
347	00:29:53	00:29:55	How's your wife doing?
348	00:29:55	00:29:57	How does it look like she's doing?
349	00:29:57	00:29:59	You know, I just have a couple of questions.
350	00:30:00	00:30:01	Maybe we should talk outside.
351	00:30:01	00:30:03	We can talk here.
352	00:30:03	00:30:04	Okay.
353	00:30:04	00:30:10	You know, when the detective interviewed you earlier, why didn't you tell him that your best friend and his family had just been killed?
354	00:30:10	00:30:13	I didn't know then.
355	00:30:13	00:30:15	Were you at Morgan's house yesterday?
356	00:30:15	00:30:16	No.
357	00:30:16	00:30:18	How about your wife?
358	00:30:18	00:30:20	Not that I know of. Why would she?
359	00:30:20	00:30:22	Well, she's been spending a lot of time there.
360	00:30:22	00:30:24	What's that supposed to mean?
361	00:30:24	00:30:26	Your wife was having an affair with your best friend.
362	00:30:26	00:30:29	Look, I feel for you, Neal; I do.
363	00:30:29	00:30:33	Friends don't sleep with their friend's wives.
364	00:30:33	00:30:36	You think you know how I feel?
365	00:30:37	00:30:39	Guilty?
366	00:30:41	00:30:44	Yeah.
367	00:30:44	00:30:46	I do feel guilty.
368	00:30:49	00:30:52	I was unable to give my wife what she needed.
369	00:30:52	00:30:56	If she went to Morgan, that's the reason.
370	00:30:56	00:30:59	She never handled rejection well.
371	00:30:59	00:31:02	So, if Morgan rejected her, how would she have taken that?
372	00:31:02	00:31:04	Badly.
373	00:31:04	00:31:06	Bad enough to kill?
374	00:31:11	00:31:13	Not Tara.
375	00:31:26	00:31:27	How's it going?
376	00:31:27	00:31:28	Hey.
377	00:31:28	00:31:31	Checking out trajectory angles.
378	00:31:31	00:31:34	This is the shot coming out of Morgan's body.
379	00:31:36	00:31:38	What's the trajectory going into the wall?
380	00:31:38	00:31:41	Oh, the wall trajectory is a constant.
381	00:31:41	00:31:43	Morgan's is the variable here.
382	00:31:45	00:31:48	Well, there's no way those lines are gonna match up with Morgan all the way over on the bed.
383	00:31:49	00:31:50	So let's make them line up.
384	00:31:58	00:32:01	Hang on. If he shot himself there...
385	00:32:01	00:32:03	how did he end up on the bed?
386	00:32:04	00:32:06	He was moved.
387	00:32:06	00:32:09	Where is the blood spatter from the initial wound?
388	00:32:09	00:32:10	Wait.
389	00:32:10	00:32:11	Morgan's wound bled out here.
390	00:32:11	00:32:15	The blood puddle covered the initial spatter.
391	00:32:30	00:32:32	There was someone else in that room.
392	00:32:32	00:32:36	So maybe Neal or Tara Matthews has blood on their clothes.
393	00:32:36	00:32:37	Time to check the house.
394	00:34:00	00:34:03	You found a basal thermometer at the Stewart house?
395	00:34:03	00:34:04	Yeah.
396	00:34:04	00:34:06	It was crushed on the master bedroom floor. Why?
397	00:34:08	00:34:11	I found one in Tara Matthews' vanity drawer.
398	00:34:13	00:34:18	I was just looking at Corinne Stewart's autopsy report.
399	00:34:18	00:34:19	Uh...
400	00:34:19	00:34:21	She had a tubal ligation, so...
401	00:34:21	00:34:24	she obviously wasn't trying to have kids.
402	00:34:24	00:34:27	Tara was.
403	00:34:58	00:34:59	So it's been confirmed.
404	00:34:59	00:35:01	Tara Matthews is pregnant.
405	00:35:01	00:35:04	Third-degree burns on most of her body and she doesn't miscarry?
406	00:35:05	00:35:07	A mother's body is designed to protect her baby.
407	00:35:07	00:35:11	I don't know, all that trauma and morphine...
408	00:35:11	00:35:14	it'll be a miracle if she brings it to term.
409	00:35:14	00:35:15	Do we have any idea who the father is?
410	00:35:15	00:35:17	Too early to tell.
411	00:35:17	00:35:18	She's just a few weeks pregnant.
412	00:35:18	00:35:21	Okay, we know that Morgan and Tara were having sex.
413	00:35:22	00:35:27	The broken basal thermometer we found in the bedroom implies that she was trying to conceive with him, and not her husband.
414	00:35:27	00:35:30	Neal could've been shooting blanks.
415	00:35:30	00:35:31	Medical records will confirm that.
416	00:35:32	00:35:35	And Neal and Morgan were best friends...
417	00:35:35	00:35:36	Somebody she may have felt comfortable with.
418	00:35:37	00:35:40	Neal catches Morgan in bed with his wife...
419	00:35:44	00:35:46	He knows where the best friend keeps his gun.
420	00:35:47	00:35:50	The glass in Neal's shoe just puts him at the scene.
421	00:35:50	00:35:54	We didn't find any blood on the clothes we recovered from his house.
422	00:35:54	00:35:55	Clothes are easy to dump.
423	00:35:55	00:35:58	The glass was an oversight, he didn't even know it was there.
424	00:35:58	00:35:59	Or maybe he didn't kill anybody.
425	00:35:59	00:36:01	Which leaves Tara.
426	00:36:01	00:36:02	There was no blood on her clothes either.
427	00:36:02	00:36:04	At least nothing at the house.
428	00:36:04	00:36:06	And the clothes she was wearing went up in flames.
429	00:36:10	00:36:11	Not everything.
430	00:37:00	00:37:02	We got a problem, Neal.
431	00:37:02	00:37:06	We found chlorine from the Stewarts' pool on your wife's sweater.
432	00:37:06	00:37:08	That puts her at the scene.
433	00:37:08	00:37:11	We're going to be charging her with the murders.
434	00:37:15	00:37:17	Whatever happened...
435	00:37:17	00:37:19	Tara couldn't have done it on purpose.
436	00:37:19	00:37:21	It must've been some sort of accident.
437	00:37:21	00:37:27	Well, the way we see it, you know, Tara went back to Morgan's house to tell him that she was pregnant with his child, and...
438	00:37:27	00:37:30	What, she told you the baby was yours?
439	00:37:30	00:37:32	Yeah.
440	00:37:32	00:37:35	And you believed her?
441	00:37:35	00:37:37	We were trying to have a baby. Why wouldn't I?
442	00:37:37	00:37:39	Oh, well, sure.
443	00:37:39	00:37:41	I mean, you and Morgan are close enough in looks.
444	00:37:41	00:37:43	She probably would've gotten away with it.
445	00:37:43	00:37:51	She always said that a woman without a child of her own wasn't a woman.
446	00:37:51	00:37:54	We tried in vitro fertilization a half a dozen times.
447	00:37:54	00:37:55	Yeah, we know.
448	00:37:55	00:37:56	We subpoenaed your medical records.
449	00:37:56	00:37:57	You had bad sperm.
450	00:37:59	00:38:00	Anyway...
451	00:38:00	00:38:06	Tara went over to try to get Morgan to leave his family, he said no, she flipped out, she went nuts.
452	00:38:06	00:38:08	She's got a history of depression, right? Total terror.
453	00:38:08	00:38:12	I mean, I suppose Morgan got what he deserved.
454	00:38:12	00:38:16	But just because you're defective doesn't mean that Tara's gonna jump in bed with him.
455	00:38:16	00:38:19	I told Tara we could adopt.
456	00:38:19	00:38:21	She wouldn't.
457	00:38:21	00:38:24	And Corinne and the kid...
458	00:38:24	00:38:26	wrong place, wrong time, I guess.
459	00:38:26	00:38:29	She wanted to have a family so bad...
460	00:38:29	00:38:31	And you couldn't give it to her, so she took her business elsewhere.
461	00:38:31	00:38:33	And it didn't take long for Morgan to hit a home run...
462	00:38:33	00:38:35	Stop talking about it like that.
463	00:38:35	00:38:38	Just because she's lying burned up in a hospital room carrying your best friend's kid...
464	00:38:38	00:38:40	No! ...isn't going to cut it with the D.A.
465	00:38:40	00:38:42	No, I'm... Look, Neal, Not another word. she killed three people.
466	00:38:43	00:38:44	I want you to shut up! Just shut up!
467	00:38:44	00:38:46	Neal, please. Let's go. Go ahead and walk.
468	00:38:46	00:38:47	Go ahead, let Tara take the fall.
469	00:38:47	00:38:49	She's probably not gonna make it anyway.
470	00:38:50	00:38:51	I love my wife.
471	00:38:51	00:38:52	Please, Neal. Let's go.
472	00:38:52	00:38:53	We know you were there.
473	00:38:53	00:38:54	We got a fragment from a basal thermometer...
474	00:38:55	00:38:56	You don't know anything about her.
475	00:38:56	00:38:59	I know she wanted a baby more than she wanted to be your wife, I know that much.
476	00:38:59	00:39:02	So tell me what I don't know.
477	00:39:07	00:39:12	We were just hanging out, having a couple beers and I got a splinter.
478	00:39:12	00:39:16	Morgan said the tweezers were up in his bathroom.
479	00:39:23	00:39:26	He said it was Corinne's idea.
480	00:39:26	00:39:28	They were just trying to help us.
481	00:39:28	00:39:29	We did it for Tara.
482	00:39:30	00:39:31	You slept with my wife!
483	00:39:32	00:39:33	No!
484	00:39:38	00:39:40	Corinne! Call the police!
485	00:39:40	00:39:41	Mommy.
486	00:39:41	00:39:42	Morgan!
487	00:39:47	00:39:49	She ran.
488	00:39:49	00:39:50	She was going to call the cops.
489	00:39:50	00:39:52	I was just trying to stop her.
490	00:39:52	00:39:53	You shot her.
491	00:39:56	00:39:58	What about Dani?
492	00:40:00	00:40:02	I didn't know what else to do, so I called Tara.
493	00:40:02	00:40:05	When she came over, saw what I'd done...
494	00:40:05	00:40:07	she just freaked out.
495	00:40:07	00:40:10	I made it look like Morgan shot Corinne and then he killed himself.
496	00:40:10	00:40:12	Are you out of your mind?
497	00:40:12	00:40:13	Do you know what you've done?
498	00:40:13	00:40:15	This is all because of you.
499	00:40:15	00:40:16	Neal...
500	00:40:16	00:40:18	what happened to Dani?
501	00:40:20	00:40:22	Dani!
502	00:40:43	00:40:47	She said we didn't deserve to live, neither one of us.
503	00:40:47	00:40:51	And then she just ran out the door.
504	00:40:51	00:40:54	I was afraid she was going to try to kill herself.
505	00:40:57	00:40:59	All we wanted was a baby.
