0	00:00:07	00:00:12	It's a simple proposal-- you, me, a bottle of Cristal.
1	00:00:15	00:00:17	I got to take this.
2	00:00:17	00:00:19	Welcome to Tasty Time.
3	00:00:19	00:00:21	Like to try our new chocolate sundae?
4	00:00:21	00:00:23	Hello?
5	00:00:23	00:00:25	Come in, Houston.
6	00:00:25	00:00:26	Tasty Time. Over.
7	00:00:26	00:00:28	Number 17.
8	00:00:28	00:00:30	Okay.
9	00:00:30	00:00:33	Uno diecisiete coming up.
10	00:00:33	00:00:35	Want that monster-sized?
11	00:00:37	00:00:40	I'll take that as a no.
12	00:00:40	00:00:42	$6.43. Pull forward.
13	00:01:01	00:01:02	Oh, very funny.
14	00:01:02	00:01:05	Hey, who's gonna pay for this?
15	00:01:26	00:01:34	So according to the Tasty Time kid over here, this whole thing started when the convertible just cruised through the fast food window.
16	00:01:34	00:01:36	Got nailed by the truck.
17	00:01:36	00:01:38	You know what they say, fast food kills you.
18	00:01:38	00:01:40	Not usually quite so fast.
19	00:01:40	00:01:46	So the witnesses at the burger joint said that the car seemed to be on autopilot--no driver.
20	00:01:46	00:01:50	So maybe he had a heart attack or an aneurysm and slumped over after ordering.
21	00:01:50	00:01:54	Last supper, favorite restaurant, didn't have a chance to enjoy it.
22	00:01:54	00:01:56	Yeah, the R.O. is Danny Clegg.
23	00:01:56	00:02:00	He's got a long sheet-- burglary, assault possession, you know.
24	00:02:00	00:02:02	What did he order?
25	00:02:02	00:02:04	Why?
26	00:02:04	00:02:05	Curious.
27	00:02:08	00:02:11	He ordered a number 17-- triple cheeseburger deluxe.
28	00:02:11	00:02:12	Okay.
29	00:02:12	00:02:14	All right.
30	00:02:14	00:02:18	So Jeep gets clipped by this convertible--Mr. 17.
31	00:02:18	00:02:21	Red paint transfer from the convertible.
32	00:02:21	00:02:25	Knocking him off-course and into the light pole.
33	00:02:25	00:02:28	The driver was ejected. No seat belt.
34	00:02:28	00:02:30	James Marshall, 20's, college kid.
35	00:02:30	00:02:32	Second DUI this year.
36	00:02:32	00:02:35	He was working on this third here.
37	00:02:35	00:02:36	Yeah, he got more than a hangover this time.
38	00:02:36	00:02:39	Well, this boy cracked his egg wide open.
39	00:02:43	00:02:45	What about our truck driver?
40	00:02:45	00:02:52	Okay, so the truck hits the convertible, rolls on its side, leaving the driver speechless.
41	00:03:00	00:03:04	Oh! All right, fellas, we got a math problem here.
42	00:03:04	00:03:06	Never very good at math.
43	00:03:06	00:03:08	We got three dead drivers, right?
44	00:03:08	00:03:10	Right. All with their brains still inside their heads.
45	00:03:10	00:03:12	Yeah. So?
46	00:03:12	00:03:14	What's this brain doing down here?
47	00:03:19	00:03:21	This is going to be fun.
48	00:04:00	00:04:01	You must be Charlie.
49	00:04:01	00:04:03	Sorry. I was just...
50	00:04:03	00:04:04	No, no, no, no, it's all good.
51	00:04:04	00:04:06	I'm Nick Stokes.
52	00:04:06	00:04:08	It's nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.
53	00:04:08	00:04:11	You're the same guy that's the starting point guard at WLVU, right?
54	00:04:11	00:04:13	Yeah. Nice work.
55	00:04:13	00:04:15	Are you, uh, are you here for a family meeting?
56	00:04:15	00:04:17	Dad's talked about our family meetings?
57	00:04:17	00:04:20	Well, they've been pretty much dialed into the curriculum around here.
58	00:04:20	00:04:22	So is he serious about raising your hand?
59	00:04:22	00:04:25	Not anymore. No, we had a family meeting about that.
60	00:04:25	00:04:26	Hey, look who's here.
61	00:04:26	00:04:27	Hey, buddy. Hey.
62	00:04:27	00:04:30	You met my son.
63	00:04:30	00:04:31	Pretty cool, huh?
64	00:04:31	00:04:35	What are you doing here? I thought the bus 00.
65	00:04:35	00:04:37	Yeah, it did.
66	00:04:38	00:04:41	Oh, you have a game tonight?
67	00:04:41	00:04:44	Which, clearly, you're not going to make.
68	00:04:44	00:04:49	Tell you what-- Mr. Russell, if you would call me after you've read that.
69	00:04:49	00:04:50	It's the DMV records on all our vics.
70	00:04:50	00:04:53	Clegg's the only one with a rap sheet.
71	00:04:53	00:04:54	It's good to meet you, Charlie.
72	00:04:54	00:04:57	Hey, I really look forward to seeing you light it up, man.
73	00:04:57	00:04:58	Thanks. All right.
74	00:04:58	00:05:00	All right.
75	00:05:00	00:05:02	Talk to me.
76	00:05:02	00:05:05	I missed curfew last night by, like, five minutes.
77	00:05:05	00:05:07	Coach suspended me for a game. It's stupid.
78	00:05:07	00:05:08	What's stupid? You broke a rule.
79	00:05:08	00:05:12	Technically, but Coach is a lot different now that I'm recruited.
80	00:05:12	00:05:13	He's a little Mussolini.
81	00:05:13	00:05:15	Yeah, but the rules didn't change, did they?
82	00:05:18	00:05:20	All right.
83	00:05:20	00:05:23	Stop by the house tonight and we'll talk it through, okay?
84	00:05:26	00:05:31	Hey, just for the record, exactly how long is like, five minutes?
85	00:05:31	00:05:35	Three hours, give or take.
86	00:05:43	00:05:44	Got a cooler here.
87	00:05:44	00:05:46	Maybe Clegg was drinking and driving.
88	00:05:46	00:05:47	Maybe.
89	00:05:52	00:05:54	No booze.
90	00:05:54	00:05:56	I don't know about drinking and driving.
91	00:05:56	00:05:57	More like thinking and driving.
92	00:05:59	00:06:01	Got some brain matter here.
93	00:06:02	00:06:04	Hmm.
94	00:06:04	00:06:08	Looks like Clegg might have been transporting our mystery brain.
95	00:06:08	00:06:12	You know, he could be working for a medical company or something like that.
96	00:06:12	00:06:15	Well, he was definitely into medicine, but I wouldn't trust him to drive my brain around.
97	00:06:15	00:06:16	Yeah? Why's that?
98	00:06:16	00:06:18	Oxy.
99	00:06:18	00:06:20	Oh.
100	00:06:20	00:06:22	I got a duffle bag.
101	00:06:31	00:06:33	Guy liked to work out.
102	00:06:35	00:06:39	Huh. He was into other lifting too.
103	00:06:39	00:06:40	Got a burglary tool.
104	00:06:40	00:06:44	I'm starting to get a picture of this Clegg guy. Yeah, me too.
105	00:06:44	00:06:46	There's some yellow powder on the crowbar.
106	00:06:48	00:06:52	Got some yellow powder in the bag too.
107	00:06:52	00:06:54	I have seen crappy cocaine that color.
108	00:06:54	00:06:56	I've never seen a drug addict waste this much product.
109	00:06:59	00:07:01	You know, we are down one body.
110	00:07:03	00:07:05	Trunk's where I'd hide it.
111	00:07:05	00:07:07	Yeah, pop it for me, will you?
112	00:07:19	00:07:22	Pigskin?
113	00:07:22	00:07:23	That's it?
114	00:07:23	00:07:26	You know, this is strange. Why?
115	00:07:26	00:07:28	I'm starting to think Russell's a psychic.
116	00:07:28	00:07:29	How come?
117	00:07:29	00:07:32	Well, 'cause he asked what Clegg ordered at the drive-thru window.
118	00:07:32	00:07:34	It was a number 17.
119	00:07:34	00:07:37	Or it's a coincidence, maybe.
120	00:07:37	00:07:40	Mm...he hadn't opened the trunk yet.
121	00:07:44	00:07:46	(imitating crash sounds) Oh, no.
122	00:07:50	00:07:53	The police have arrived. Thank God.
123	00:07:53	00:07:55	(chuckles) You...
124	00:07:55	00:07:57	you have fun at work, don't you?
125	00:07:57	00:08:00	Some people are visual, others are audio.
126	00:08:00	00:08:03	I just happen to be both-- audio-visual.
127	00:08:03	00:08:06	I like to process the entire experience.
128	00:08:06	00:08:13	So the tire truck smacks into the convertible, the convertible clips the Jeep, and hello, light post.
129	00:08:13	00:08:16	I have a theory about that.
130	00:08:16	00:08:18	Okay, so the brain is riding shotgun in the cooler.
131	00:08:20	00:08:22	Car gets smashed by the truck. (imitates crash sounds)
132	00:08:22	00:08:27	Cooler gets slammed up against the door-- doonk--and out pops our magical mystery brain.
133	00:08:27	00:08:30	(makes popping sound) It's only defense was to roll under a tire.
134	00:08:30	00:08:34	Hey, Russ, I found this football in Clegg's trunk.
135	00:08:34	00:08:35	It's got a number 17 on it.
136	00:08:35	00:08:37	Ha! I'll be damned. Look at that.
137	00:08:37	00:08:39	How'd you know that?
138	00:08:39	00:08:41	What color is the horse?
139	00:08:45	00:08:48	Really? No, it's a famous story.
140	00:08:48	00:08:50	A traffic accident near a ranch, right?
141	00:08:50	00:08:53	Several cars and a horse are involved.
142	00:08:53	00:08:59	The horse is severely injured and the officer at the scene wants to put him out of his misery with his .357.
143	00:08:59	00:09:05	Unfortunately, the bullet ricochets off the horse's skull and hits an officer standing nearby.
144	00:09:05	00:09:06	Kills him dead as a doornail.
145	00:09:06	00:09:13	And when this is all reported to the chief, the only question he asks, What color's the horse?
146	00:09:13	00:09:22	There were seasoned investigators all over that scene for hours, taking notes, gathering evidence-- but nobody noted the color of the horse.
147	00:09:22	00:09:26	If you miss one small detail, then who knows what else you've missed.
148	00:09:26	00:09:29	'Cause you never know what's important.
149	00:09:29	00:09:32	Cool story, huh? That's a good story.
150	00:09:43	00:09:48	Looks like Mr. Clegg swallowed a couple oxycodones antemortem.
151	00:09:48	00:09:50	Sara did find drugs in is car.
152	00:09:50	00:09:51	He's got a lot of track marks.
153	00:09:51	00:09:53	Clegg here was a junkie.
154	00:09:53	00:09:55	Looks like chicken nuggets.
155	00:09:55	00:09:58	Takes two to four hours for food to clear the stomach.
156	00:09:58	00:10:02	This guy binged on fast food before he ordered more.
157	00:10:02	00:10:03	Equal opportunity junkie.
158	00:10:03	00:10:05	Junkie being the operative word.
159	00:10:05	00:10:08	I don't think Mr. Clegg died as a result of the accident.
160	00:10:08	00:10:14	Frothy edematous lungs, pills, track marks-- looks like an O.D.
161	00:10:14	00:10:20	So what are we going to do about the brain-topsy?
162	00:10:20	00:10:22	To the scale, Ms. Brody.
163	00:10:22	00:10:23	Weigh it.
164	00:10:23	00:10:24	Oh, cool.
165	00:10:34	00:10:36	3.4 pounds.
166	00:10:36	00:10:37	That's heavy-ish.
167	00:10:37	00:10:41	A female brain tips the scales at probably 2.8-ish.
168	00:10:41	00:10:44	Average male brain weighs just over three pounds.
169	00:10:44	00:10:45	Average female just under.
170	00:10:45	00:10:47	So this brain's a boy.
171	00:10:47	00:10:48	Well, DNA confirmed it.
172	00:10:48	00:10:50	Didn't help us any making the I.D.
173	00:10:50	00:10:53	Hello, Brain Doe.
174	00:10:53	00:10:55	So what's next?
175	00:10:55	00:10:58	Check it for freshness, see if there are any signs of decomp.
176	00:10:58	00:11:01	Mm-hmm... blood vessels still look fairly red.
177	00:11:01	00:11:03	Go ahead, poke it.
178	00:11:03	00:11:05	(laughs) That's it.
179	00:11:05	00:11:06	Feels like Jell-O.
180	00:11:06	00:11:08	It's unfixed.
181	00:11:08	00:11:10	No grossing or formalin present.
182	00:11:10	00:11:13	Means it was extracted within the last 24 hours.
183	00:11:13	00:11:16	Incision is precise, brain stem's been cut clean.
184	00:11:16	00:11:17	Skillfully removed.
185	00:11:17	00:11:19	Cutter was a pro.
186	00:11:19	00:11:20	Maybe a research specimen?
187	00:11:20	00:11:22	No way.
188	00:11:22	00:11:25	Specimens are immediately fixed in formaldehyde.
189	00:11:25	00:11:27	Oh.
190	00:11:27	00:11:28	That's even more awesome.
191	00:11:28	00:11:31	We might be talking about black market brains.
192	00:11:31	00:11:33	Thanks, Doc.
193	00:11:33	00:11:35	This has been fun.
194	00:11:37	00:11:40	Is it just me or are defense attorneys getting smarter?
195	00:11:40	00:11:42	Oh! No! Slimier!
196	00:11:42	00:11:44	Don't worry, we still have the truth on our side.
197	00:11:44	00:11:46	I still don't like that guy.
198	00:11:46	00:11:48	There was nothing wrong with my evidence collection.
199	00:11:48	00:11:50	At least he didn't ask you if it was Dr. Willows.
200	00:11:52	00:11:55	(knocking) Sanders. Willows.
201	00:11:55	00:11:57	Coming or going?
202	00:11:57	00:12:00	We are just returning from court, Sheriff.
203	00:12:00	00:12:03	Sanders, you look like you could use a cup of coffee.
204	00:12:07	00:12:08	Nice seeing you too, Sheriff.
205	00:12:10	00:12:12	You in the neighborhood?
206	00:12:12	00:12:13	Not really.
207	00:12:15	00:12:18	So, um...how are things going?
208	00:12:19	00:12:22	No complaints. Really.
209	00:12:22	00:12:24	I'd complain.
210	00:12:24	00:12:26	You were a supervisor, now you're not.
211	00:12:26	00:12:28	No advancement on the horizon.
212	00:12:28	00:12:30	I'd be pissed.
213	00:12:30	00:12:31	I work with some good people.
214	00:12:31	00:12:34	It takes the sting off.
215	00:12:34	00:12:36	Well, maybe I can do a little better than that.
216	00:12:36	00:12:37	I've been spending a lot of time on the Hill.
217	00:12:37	00:12:42	Senate Judiciary Committee is exploring establishing a Forensic Science Commission.
218	00:12:42	00:12:45	They need a full-time staffer, expert in the field.
219	00:12:45	00:12:46	I recommended you.
220	00:12:48	00:12:50	I hope you're good with that.
221	00:12:50	00:12:53	Uh... wow.
222	00:12:53	00:12:55	I don't know what to say.
223	00:12:55	00:12:59	Do you really want to be processing used condoms and dirty panties the rest of your career?
224	00:13:01	00:13:02	Go to D.C.
225	00:13:02	00:13:05	Pay's good, the hours are great.
226	00:13:05	00:13:07	You get to travel.
227	00:13:07	00:13:10	Sometimes you have to move out to move up.
228	00:13:12	00:13:14	If you're interested, don't take too long.
229	00:13:14	00:13:16	Thank you, Sheriff. Thank you.
230	00:13:16	00:13:18	I appreciate the confidence.
231	00:13:18	00:13:20	It's not easy for us.
232	00:13:20	00:13:22	Not in law enforcement.
233	00:13:22	00:13:24	It's a... man's world.
234	00:13:29	00:13:31	Ah. Sheriff.
235	00:13:31	00:13:33	You here on business?
236	00:13:33	00:13:35	Always.
237	00:13:38	00:13:40	Hey, Catherine.
238	00:13:40	00:13:42	Everything all right?
239	00:13:42	00:13:44	Yeah.
240	00:13:44	00:13:45	Why wouldn't it be?
241	00:13:45	00:13:46	No reason. No reason at all.
242	00:13:46	00:13:49	Um, just got a call-out.
243	00:13:49	00:13:51	A 406 at a mortuary. And you're gonna love this part...
244	00:13:51	00:13:56	comes with an NRS 200.033.
245	00:13:56	00:13:58	I have no idea what the hell that is.
246	00:13:58	00:14:00	You ever seen so many numbers in a sentence before?
247	00:14:00	00:14:03	Is this an assignment or an observation?
248	00:14:03	00:14:05	(cell phone rings) Uh, yeah. Sorry. Both.
249	00:14:05	00:14:08	Okay. Got it. Russell.
250	00:14:08	00:14:10	Only two brains were transported in the last 24 hours.
251	00:14:10	00:14:14	One belonged to Nora Babbit, 77, Alzheimer's patient.
252	00:14:14	00:14:17	Her brain went to WLVU Center for Gerontology.
253	00:14:17	00:14:18	And the other one?
254	00:14:18	00:14:21	Ryan Dempsey, 42, suicide.
255	00:14:21	00:14:23	His brain went to St. Sebastian's.
256	00:14:23	00:14:25	Being studied for repetitive trauma.
257	00:14:25	00:14:27	So both the packages arrived?
258	00:14:27	00:14:29	Safe and unsound.
259	00:14:29	00:14:30	That's what I call a dead end.
260	00:14:35	00:14:38	Hey. Hi, Lou.
261	00:14:38	00:14:41	You okay?
262	00:14:41	00:14:43	Why does everybody keep asking me that?
263	00:14:43	00:14:47	Okay... Lieutenant Theodore Seligson, 30.
264	00:14:47	00:14:48	On leave from Afghanistan.
265	00:14:48	00:14:50	Cutting trees in his backyard.
266	00:14:50	00:14:51	He fell and he broke his neck.
267	00:14:51	00:14:53	Guy survived the war... Yeah.
268	00:14:53	00:14:57	Family's Jewish. Now, they had to get him in the ground by this morning.
269	00:14:57	00:15:02	Someone is supposed to remain with the body, but the mortuary night guy stayed with his girlfriend last night instead.
270	00:15:02	00:15:04	Came in this morning and he called it in.
271	00:15:04	00:15:05	That was Mrs. Seligson, the widow.
272	00:15:05	00:15:07	She came by as soon as she heard.
273	00:15:07	00:15:09	How bad is it?
274	00:15:09	00:15:12	You need to see for yourself.
275	00:15:12	00:15:14	I didn't think corpses bled.
276	00:15:15	00:15:17	Embalming is considered desecration.
277	00:15:17	00:15:19	Oh, really?
278	00:15:19	00:15:23	What about cutting a guy's head open and taking his brain?
279	00:15:26	00:15:28	This guy was a war hero.
280	00:15:28	00:15:31	I heard you guys found a brain outside a Tasty Time.
281	00:15:31	00:15:33	That's got to be his, right?
282	00:15:33	00:15:35	Well, it better be.
283	00:15:35	00:15:38	Otherwise, we got a brain collector on the loose in Vegas.
284	00:15:54	00:15:56	Heard you could use a little help.
285	00:15:56	00:15:57	Yeah, thanks.
286	00:15:57	00:16:03	Our mortuary owner 00, the last thing they do is mop the floors.
287	00:16:03	00:16:06	These impressions have got to belong to our brain thief.
288	00:16:06	00:16:08	You haven't heard. Heard what?
289	00:16:08	00:16:13	Henry ran the DNA of our mystery brain against Lieutenant Seligson's DNA in the military database.
290	00:16:13	00:16:16	No match?
291	00:16:16	00:16:18	Somebody breaks into a mortuary and steals a brain.
292	00:16:18	00:16:22	Meanwhile, across town, another brain flies out of a convertible during a TC.
293	00:16:22	00:16:24	I mean, what are the odds?
294	00:16:24	00:16:26	The two events have to be related.
295	00:16:33	00:16:36	This powder here says that they are.
296	00:16:36	00:16:38	Nick and I processed Clegg's car.
297	00:16:38	00:16:41	We found a crowbar and yellow powder that looked like this.
298	00:16:41	00:16:43	So Clegg is the connection.
299	00:16:43	00:16:45	Maybe.
300	00:16:47	00:16:49	Hodges.
301	00:16:49	00:16:51	I'm sending you a photo of a shoe impression.
302	00:16:51	00:16:54	I need you to compare it to our convertible driver Clegg's shoes.
303	00:16:54	00:16:56	Coming at you.
304	00:17:08	00:17:09	Perfect match.
305	00:17:09	00:17:11	Clegg was definitely at the mortuary.
306	00:17:11	00:17:12	And he'd been there before.
307	00:17:12	00:17:14	Clegg's employment records.
308	00:17:14	00:17:20	Guy held down a half-dozen odd jobs, including grave-shift body pickups for mortuaries across town.
309	00:17:20	00:17:22	His tox panel-- serious drug cocktail.
310	00:17:22	00:17:25	Positive for oxycodone, fentanyl, and DMT.
311	00:17:25	00:17:27	What's DMT? I don't know that.
312	00:17:27	00:17:28	Di-Methyl-Triptamine.
313	00:17:28	00:17:30	It's found in certain herbs.
314	00:17:30	00:17:35	Creates a super-intense high that only lasts about two minutes--instant painkiller.
315	00:17:35	00:17:41	Okay, so, Clegg was intensely high at both scenes-- the brain snatching and the traffic accident.
316	00:17:41	00:17:46	But somewhere in between, Seligson's brain is magically replaced with our mystery brain--how?
317	00:17:46	00:17:48	Well, we know the timeline.
318	00:17:48	00:17:55	Clegg stole Seligson's brain 00 p.m., when he hit the mortuary, 00 a.m., when he hit the drive-thru.
319	00:17:55	00:17:57	With a new brain.
320	00:17:57	00:17:59	So... oh, Lord.
321	00:17:59	00:18:02	Um, all right, so...
322	00:18:02	00:18:08	who's our mystery brain belong to, and where did Lt. Seligson's go?
323	00:18:08	00:18:10	Chicken nuggets.
324	00:18:10	00:18:11	Sorry?
325	00:18:11	00:18:18	Doc found partially digested chicken nuggets in Clegg's stomach--that means he got some junk food at least two to three hours before he OD'd.
326	00:18:18	00:18:22	Okay, so, Clegg nuggeted up around midnight.
327	00:18:22	00:18:27	Maybe he switched brains then. Well, if he did get the urge, then the best place to go would be Tasty Time.
328	00:18:27	00:18:29	Maybe that's where he nuggeted up.
329	00:18:29	00:18:33	So somebody needs to find out how many Tasty Times there are in Vegas. Twenty-two.
330	00:18:33	00:18:35	Really? I know it seems like a lot.
331	00:18:35	00:18:37	At times, it feels like it's not enough.
332	00:18:39	00:18:41	Let's pull surveillance from all of them.
333	00:18:41	00:18:44	Let's just take Clegg's car for a spin, shall we?
334	00:18:48	00:18:51	Wow... this guy always ordered chicken nuggets.
335	00:18:51	00:18:52	Not true.
336	00:18:52	00:18:56	He ordered a number 17 triple cheeseburger deluxe right before he died.
337	00:18:56	00:18:58	Yeah? Well, see what happens when you break pattern?
338	00:19:02	00:19:03	Oh, wait. Got it.
339	00:19:03	00:19:06	Tasty Time on Altos Boulevard.
340	00:19:06	00:19:07	53 p.m. last night.
341	00:19:07	00:19:09	Oh, and guess what he ordered?
342	00:19:09	00:19:10	Nuggets.
343	00:19:12	00:19:13	Clegg's car.
344	00:19:14	00:19:16	He's meeting somebody.
345	00:19:16	00:19:17	Think he's going to share his nuggets?
346	00:19:19	00:19:20	I think he's swapping brains.
347	00:19:20	00:19:23	Explains how Clegg ended up with our mystery brain.
348	00:19:23	00:19:25	Volvo driver gets Seligson's.
349	00:19:25	00:19:27	Punch in on the plate.
350	00:19:36	00:19:39	Volvo's registered to a Dr. Hanson Eller.
351	00:19:39	00:19:41	Seneca address.
352	00:19:44	00:19:47	Eller is a private pathologist.
353	00:19:47	00:19:49	Man would know how to remove a brain.
354	00:19:49	00:19:52	Maybe he took out our mystery brain.
355	00:19:52	00:19:53	Wait a second--Seneca.
356	00:19:53	00:19:56	Two brains were transported for research.
357	00:19:56	00:19:59	One of them was a suicide from Seneca.
358	00:20:02	00:20:05	Here it is--the brain belonged to Ryan Dempsey.
359	00:20:05	00:20:09	Vegas local...he also had a cabin in Seneca.
360	00:20:09	00:20:13	The death certificate was signed by our pathologist, Dr. Hanson Eller.
361	00:20:13	00:20:15	Guy's a licensed doctor.
362	00:20:15	00:20:18	What's he doing swapping brains at midnight in a Tasty Time parking lot?
363	00:20:18	00:20:20	I'll call Brass, have him put a broadcast out on Eller.
364	00:20:20	00:20:23	Somebody should break the news to the Dempsey family.
365	00:20:24	00:20:26	You're wrong.
366	00:20:26	00:20:29	My husband's instructions were very specific.
367	00:20:29	00:20:31	And I got a call from St. Sebastian's this morning.
368	00:20:31	00:20:33	His brain arrived.
369	00:20:33	00:20:35	Yeah. A brain arrived.
370	00:20:35	00:20:38	We don't believe that it was your husband's.
371	00:20:38	00:20:40	Well, how could that be?
372	00:20:40	00:20:42	Well, that's what we're trying to figure out.
373	00:20:42	00:20:45	Did your husband donate all of his organs to research?
374	00:20:45	00:20:48	No, just his brain.
375	00:20:48	00:20:50	Ryan...
376	00:20:50	00:20:52	thought he had C.T.E.
377	00:20:52	00:20:54	Chronic Traumatic Encephalitis.
378	00:20:54	00:20:57	My husband was a mixed marital arts fighter.
379	00:20:57	00:21:01	If you've ever seen an S.F.F. match, you know the beatings those guys take.
380	00:21:03	00:21:07	Ryan took a lot of hits over the years.
381	00:21:07	00:21:09	Concussions.
382	00:21:09	00:21:11	But he always fought through it.
383	00:21:15	00:21:17	Said he was doing it for us.
384	00:21:26	00:21:32	A year ago, he started having problems with his memory.
385	00:21:32	00:21:35	You know, he'd get confused...
386	00:21:35	00:21:36	upset...
387	00:21:36	00:21:39	And when he got upset, he...
388	00:21:42	00:21:45	Things could get bad.
389	00:21:45	00:21:48	Right.
390	00:21:56	00:21:57	It's okay.
391	00:22:01	00:22:03	Hey, kid.
392	00:22:07	00:22:09	You're Declan, right?
393	00:22:09	00:22:11	Ryan Dempsey's boy.
394	00:22:11	00:22:13	I'm Jim Brass.
395	00:22:13	00:22:14	I heard about your dad.
396	00:22:14	00:22:17	And you're sorry for my loss?
397	00:22:17	00:22:19	Yeah, I am.
398	00:22:22	00:22:27	The thing about CTE is, they don't know if you have it until after you're dead.
399	00:22:27	00:22:31	You know, they--they study your brain.
400	00:22:34	00:22:42	Even killing himself, all he could think about was making sure his brain could be studied.
401	00:22:42	00:22:43	How crazy is that?
402	00:22:43	00:22:49	I'm sorry to ask you this, Mrs. Dempsey, but can you walk me through what happened right after the suicide?
403	00:22:51	00:22:54	It was the worst night of my life.
404	00:22:56	00:22:59	My son and I had been out hiking.
405	00:22:59	00:23:02	Ryan wasn't feeling well.
406	00:23:02	00:23:05	And when we got back to the cabin...
407	00:23:07	00:23:09	...we found him.
408	00:23:09	00:23:14	I didn't know what to do, so I called, um... a family friend.
409	00:23:14	00:23:16	Who was that?
410	00:23:16	00:23:19	It was Ryan's trainer, Bill Pernin.
411	00:23:19	00:23:21	He made the arrangements?
412	00:23:21	00:23:23	He called the pathologist, Dr. Eller?
413	00:23:23	00:23:25	I--I suppose so.
414	00:23:25	00:23:27	Did you talk with Dr. Eller?
415	00:23:27	00:23:32	The man who was gonna remove my husband's brain?
416	00:23:32	00:23:34	I didn't care to meet him.
417	00:23:34	00:23:36	No, of course not.
418	00:23:39	00:23:41	Did you get along with your Dad?
419	00:23:41	00:23:44	You get along with yours?
420	00:23:44	00:23:46	No.
421	00:23:46	00:23:48	Took a belt to me.
422	00:23:48	00:23:50	Tough.
423	00:23:50	00:23:51	He was a cop too.
424	00:23:54	00:23:57	He was not a happy guy.
425	00:23:57	00:24:00	I was, like, 15 before I had the balls to belt him back.
426	00:24:00	00:24:02	I popped him in the jaw.
427	00:24:04	00:24:06	I could tell it hurt too.
428	00:24:06	00:24:08	Never felt better.
429	00:24:08	00:24:10	I never felt worse.
430	00:24:12	00:24:13	How 'bout your Mom?
431	00:24:13	00:24:15	She get along with your Dad?
432	00:24:18	00:24:19	Let's go, Deck.
433	00:24:24	00:24:25	Wife had bruising.
434	00:24:25	00:24:27	Mm.
435	00:24:27	00:24:29	Yeah, the kid's awfully quiet.
436	00:24:29	00:24:30	I'll do some checking.
437	00:24:30	00:24:32	See if there were any domestic violence calls.
438	00:24:32	00:24:34	Call Seneca P.D.
439	00:24:34	00:24:36	They had a family cabin up there.
440	00:24:36	00:24:39	Vacations can be stressful.
441	00:24:39	00:24:40	I wouldn't know.
442	00:24:40	00:24:42	(phone ringing) Aw...
443	00:24:42	00:24:43	Hold on.
444	00:24:43	00:24:46	Brass.
445	00:24:46	00:24:48	Where?
446	00:24:48	00:24:50	Okay, lock it down till we get there.
447	00:24:50	00:24:53	Dr. Eller's car just showed up.
448	00:24:53	00:24:55	I'll send Nick.
449	00:25:02	00:25:04	What do we know?
450	00:25:04	00:25:06	Security heard shots fired less than 30 minutes ago.
451	00:25:06	00:25:08	No surveillance.
452	00:25:08	00:25:09	Yeah, and no witnesses.
453	00:25:09	00:25:13	Found the vehicle just like this, backed into the space with the windows down.
454	00:25:13	00:25:15	Hmm, looks like a meet.
455	00:25:15	00:25:17	Yeah, and it wasn't his first.
456	00:25:17	00:25:20	We got him on tape at Tasty Time trading brains with Clegg.
457	00:25:23	00:25:26	It's a single GSW to the left temple through and through.
458	00:25:26	00:25:28	Bullet's in the headliner.
459	00:25:28	00:25:30	Slight upward angle.
460	00:25:30	00:25:32	Now...unless the shooter's four feet tall...
461	00:25:32	00:25:38	the car pulled up right alongside of him, right here.
462	00:25:38	00:25:42	Dips out of the driver's-side window and bam!
463	00:25:52	00:25:54	Nine millimeter.
464	00:25:54	00:25:57	We know Eller and Clegg had some kind of business arrangement.
465	00:25:57	00:26:00	Well, maybe some third party wanted a share of their brain game.
466	00:26:00	00:26:02	Yeah, a silent partner.
467	00:26:02	00:26:04	Who silenced Eller.
468	00:26:09	00:26:14	Dr. Eller delivered this brain to the hospital under the name Ryan Dempsey.
469	00:26:14	00:26:17	But DNA has confirmed that the brain is not Dempsey's.
470	00:26:17	00:26:20	In fact, it's Lieutenant Seligson's.
471	00:26:20	00:26:22	Couldn't pick him out in a crowd.
472	00:26:22	00:26:23	I beg to differ.
473	00:26:23	00:26:25	Care to elaborate?
474	00:26:28	00:26:31	Take a look at that butchered brain stem.
475	00:26:31	00:26:33	This brain's a hack job.
476	00:26:35	00:26:41	But Dempsey's brain, the one they found at the accident, was surgically removed by a qualified surgeon.
477	00:26:41	00:26:48	Hack job on Lieutenant Seligson's brain suggests that the cuts were made in a hurry, maybe even improvised.
478	00:26:49	00:26:51	Which can only mean one thing...
479	00:26:51	00:26:58	So you're saying that somebody wanted a brain in a hurry, so they broke into the mortuary and hacked out Lieutenant Seligson's?
480	00:26:58	00:27:00	Ryan Dempsey commits suicide.
481	00:27:00	00:27:04	He's convinced he's got a degenerative brain disorder, so he donates his brain to science.
482	00:27:04	00:27:07	But Clegg swaps it out so it can't be studied.
483	00:27:07	00:27:09	Giving him a brain upgrade in the process.
484	00:27:09	00:27:10	Upgrade?
485	00:27:10	00:27:12	That's why Clegg chose Seligson's brain.
486	00:27:12	00:27:14	Lieutenant Seligson was Jewish.
487	00:27:14	00:27:18	And Jewish tradition says a body can't be embalmed.
488	00:27:18	00:27:20	Preferably it goes in the ground within 24 hours.
489	00:27:20	00:27:23	So the Lieutenant's brain was fresh.
490	00:27:23	00:27:25	Just what St. Sebastian's was expecting.
491	00:27:25	00:27:27	A perfect specimen.
492	00:27:27	00:27:28	No chemicals, no decomp.
493	00:27:28	00:27:30	No brain disease.
494	00:27:30	00:27:37	Okay, so Ryan Dempsey wanted to have his brain studied 'cause he was afraid he had CTE and he wanted the truth to come out.
495	00:27:37	00:27:39	And clearly someone else didn't.
496	00:27:39	00:27:45	Someone who was willing to grave rob, brain swap, and pop a pathologist to cover it all up.
497	00:27:45	00:27:46	The silent partner.
498	00:27:49	00:27:51	Hodges, what are you doing?
499	00:27:51	00:27:54	Um, it's a break room.
500	00:27:54	00:27:55	I'm on a break.
501	00:27:55	00:27:58	You know chickens' nuggets don't really look like that, right?
502	00:27:58	00:28:00	Please don't ruin my lunch..
503	00:28:00	00:28:03	Fine. Uh, yellow powder trace? Give.
504	00:28:03	00:28:04	Receive.
505	00:28:04	00:28:08	You know, I've been trying to text you for over an hour.
506	00:28:12	00:28:13	Talcum powder.
507	00:28:13	00:28:18	In Clegg's duffel bag, on the crowbar, at the mortuary.
508	00:28:18	00:28:25	In my report, powder's made with a special formulation with five essential oils, used in high-end gyms, including my own.
509	00:28:25	00:28:27	You go to the gym? Mm-hmm.
510	00:28:27	00:28:29	Under this shirt...
511	00:28:29	00:28:31	ripped.
512	00:28:31	00:28:33	Oh, I--I believe you.
513	00:28:33	00:28:36	Page four-- it's a list of gyms.
514	00:28:36	00:28:38	Not even real chicken in there.
515	00:28:41	00:28:44	Ryan Dempsey. The Man Without Fear.
516	00:28:44	00:28:46	52 and nine.
517	00:28:46	00:28:48	Ooh, that looks like one of the nine.
518	00:28:48	00:28:52	Yeah, and that... looks like Danny Clegg.
519	00:28:52	00:28:54	The guy who had Dempsey's brain in his convertible?
520	00:28:54	00:28:55	They knew each other.
521	00:28:55	00:28:56	They were in the S.F.F. together.
522	00:28:56	00:28:59	They trained together until Clegg got kicked out of the league for drugs.
523	00:28:59	00:29:06	Well, that powder in Clegg's gym bag was a specific type of talc used at certain gyms.
524	00:29:06	00:29:08	Bill Pernin's Power Center.
525	00:29:08	00:29:10	It's on the list.
526	00:29:12	00:29:14	Dempsey's widow said Bill Pernin was his trainer.
527	00:29:14	00:29:18	And he's the family friend who made arrangements for Dempsey's brain.
528	00:29:18	00:29:20	Yeah, that connects him to Dempsey, Clegg and Dr. Eller.
529	00:29:20	00:29:24	Pernin just signed a multi-million-dollar deal with Real Fuel?
530	00:29:24	00:29:27	One of his fighters turning up with CTE cannot be good for advertising.
531	00:29:27	00:30:02	[all grunting and panting] Bill Pernin?
532	00:30:02	00:30:03	Yeah. Can I help you?
533	00:30:03	00:30:04	You got a minute?
534	00:30:06	00:30:08	Yeah.
535	00:30:08	00:30:10	Do a couple rounds of shadow boxing.
536	00:30:10	00:30:11	Good work.
537	00:30:11	00:30:15	Let me guess, you two are here about the Real Fuel Couple's Boot Camp, huh?
538	00:30:15	00:30:17	Ah, it's gonna be a terrific weekend.
539	00:30:17	00:30:19	Sara Sidle. Greg Sanders.
540	00:30:19	00:30:20	We're with the Crime Lab.
541	00:30:20	00:30:22	Can we talk somewhere out of the way?
542	00:30:27	00:30:28	Yeah.
543	00:30:28	00:30:30	Nice facility.
544	00:30:30	00:30:33	Oh, thanks, man. It's my dream.
545	00:30:33	00:30:35	You know, 20 years of blood, sweat and tears.
546	00:30:35	00:30:37	So, uh, what's up?
547	00:30:37	00:30:38	You guys aren't here to hit the heavy bag.
548	00:30:38	00:30:40	What's going on?
549	00:30:40	00:30:41	We're here about Dr. Hanson Eller.
550	00:30:41	00:30:42	The, uh, pathologist.
551	00:30:42	00:30:44	Yeah, he used to train at my old gym.
552	00:30:44	00:30:49	You hired him to remove your friend Ryan Dempsey's brain?
553	00:30:49	00:30:51	Yeah, yeah, that's right.
554	00:30:51	00:30:53	His wife asked me to help with the funeral arrangements.
555	00:30:53	00:30:56	I don't think those were the arrangements that she had in mind.
556	00:30:56	00:30:58	What are you talking about?
557	00:30:58	00:31:04	We're talking about how your friend Ryan Dempsey's brain ended up in your other friend Danny Clegg's cooler.
558	00:31:04	00:31:06	Okay... look, I'm still not following you.
559	00:31:06	00:31:13	Eller, Dempsey, Clegg-- the only thing these three guys had in common, other than your training, is that they're all dead.
560	00:31:13	00:31:15	Wow.
561	00:31:15	00:31:18	Look, if something happened to Danny Clegg and Dr. Eller, that's news to me.
562	00:31:18	00:31:20	When's the last time you saw them?
563	00:31:20	00:31:21	I haven't seen Danny in months.
564	00:31:21	00:31:24	Poor guy was a junkie. I had to toss him out of here.
565	00:31:24	00:31:29	And Dr. Eller--the last time we saw each other, I was crying over my friend's body.
566	00:31:29	00:31:32	If you'll excuse me, I got about three different meetings that I'm late for.
567	00:31:32	00:31:34	So if you need me, my number's on the wall.
568	00:31:34	00:31:36	Other than that, great meeting you.
569	00:31:39	00:31:41	Would you buy a membership off that guy?
570	00:31:41	00:31:43	Not a lifetime one.
571	00:31:46	00:31:48	Well, I don't think I am overreacting.
572	00:31:48	00:31:51	Yeah, he lied to his coach, then he lied to me.
573	00:31:51	00:31:53	It's not just about basketball.
574	00:31:53	00:31:56	It's about life.
575	00:31:56	00:32:01	Yeah, you say that whenever you're trying to get off the phone, so I'm gonna get off the phone first.
576	00:32:01	00:32:02	I love you too.
577	00:32:03	00:32:05	You rang?
578	00:32:05	00:32:08	Yeah. I ran my theory on the domestic troubles with the Dempseys.
579	00:32:08	00:32:10	Came up empty.
580	00:32:10	00:32:12	You didn't call me over here just to tell me that...
581	00:32:12	00:32:13	did you?
582	00:32:13	00:32:16	No. Look at these.
583	00:32:16	00:32:18	These are photos of Ryan Dempsey's suicide.
584	00:32:18	00:32:19	Gun on the floor.
585	00:32:19	00:32:21	Half a bottle of bourbon in front of him.
586	00:32:21	00:32:24	It took the investigator just 20 minutes to call it.
587	00:32:24	00:32:26	Do you see what I don't see?
588	00:32:26	00:32:27	Yeah, I do.
589	00:32:27	00:32:30	No gunshot residue on the guy's T-shirt.
590	00:32:30	00:32:32	Gun had to be at least three feet away.
591	00:32:32	00:32:34	That's pretty tricky for a suicide.
592	00:32:34	00:32:37	Even a 36-inch sleeve couldn't pull that off.
593	00:32:39	00:32:41	Ryan Dempsey was murdered.
594	00:32:46	00:32:49	All right, let's start by getting our own brains straight.
595	00:32:49	00:32:54	Now that the smoke and tires have cleared, what do we know-- really know--for sure.
596	00:32:54	00:32:59	Well, we've got Ryan Dempsey, an S.F.F. fighter murdered, staged to look like a suicide.
597	00:32:59	00:33:03	Cops found a .38 special near the body with Dempsey's prints on it.
598	00:33:03	00:33:06	Per his will, Dempsey's brain was on its way to being studied for CTE.
599	00:33:06	00:33:10	Except somebody intercepted it and substituted another healthy brain.
600	00:33:10	00:33:13	Enlisting Danny Clegg, who OD'd.
601	00:33:13	00:33:14	And Doc Eller, who was shot to death.
602	00:33:14	00:33:16	Why?
603	00:33:16	00:33:19	I mean, let's say that the brain did get to where it's supposed to go.
604	00:33:19	00:33:21	It was studied and Dempsey had CTE.
605	00:33:21	00:33:23	So what? I mean, wouldn't that be on him?
606	00:33:23	00:33:26	Pernin would still not want to have been associated with that.
607	00:33:26	00:33:29	Yeah, but enough to kill for?
608	00:33:29	00:33:31	Maybe Dempsey's brain's hiding another secret?
609	00:33:31	00:33:32	Keep going.
610	00:33:32	00:33:37	Well, according to Clegg's tox panel, he OD'd on quite the drug cocktail, including DMT, right?
611	00:33:37	00:33:39	The instant painkiller.
612	00:33:39	00:33:43	Yeah, maybe the perfect lift to get him through a tough fight.
613	00:33:43	00:33:45	Pernin could be doping his fighters.
614	00:33:45	00:33:47	Now, that might be worth covering up.
615	00:33:47	00:33:49	And also worth killing for.
616	00:33:49	00:33:55	You know something? I bet that Dempsey's brain might corroborate all of this, if we could just get it to pee in a cup.
617	00:33:55	00:34:41	[Red Hot Chili Peppers' Look Around] Am I supposed to know what this is?
618	00:34:41	00:34:43	Well, you have a medical background.
619	00:34:43	00:34:45	Yeah, in sports medicine. You know what DMT is?
620	00:34:45	00:34:49	Schedule One drug--they don't test for that in the S.F.F.
621	00:34:49	00:34:54	This report tells us that Ryan Dempsey was taking DMT, as was Danny Clegg.
622	00:34:54	00:34:57	Although I suspect that Clegg was using it recreationally.
623	00:34:57	00:35:01	A little bump from his old trainer for doing him a solid.
624	00:35:01	00:35:04	Why, why am I here, exactly?
625	00:35:04	00:35:07	Well, you made a phone call to Danny Clegg the night that Dempsey died.
626	00:35:07	00:35:09	Yeah, Clegg is an old friend of mine.
627	00:35:09	00:35:11	I got his number in my phone. Pocket dial.
628	00:35:11	00:35:16	What do you want? Oh, you pocket dialing the Dempsey home for the last four months too?
629	00:35:16	00:35:17	I was his trainer.
630	00:35:17	00:35:20	Exactly. So why were you calling when Ryan was at the gym?
631	00:35:20	00:35:22	His wife was not hard on the eyes.
632	00:35:22	00:35:25	Were you tuning her up too?
633	00:35:25	00:35:27	And Dempsey found out about it, right?
634	00:35:27	00:35:29	Why'd you do this to me? See the doctor...
635	00:35:29	00:35:31	You didn't think I'd find out?! Stop it...!
636	00:35:31	00:35:33	The guy has CTE.
637	00:35:33	00:35:34	There's only one way that's going to end.
638	00:35:37	00:35:38	And a gun is a great equalizer.
639	00:35:38	00:35:41	Joyce Dempsey called you right after.
640	00:35:41	00:35:43	According to the phone records, you were still in Vegas.
641	00:35:43	00:35:49	Two hours after that, you made a call to Dr. Eller and then 911 from Seneca.
642	00:35:51	00:35:57	You cleaned up the mess your girlfriend made, got your stories straight, and made arrangements.
643	00:36:02	00:36:05	Now I get to make another call.
644	00:36:09	00:36:11	Hey.
645	00:36:11	00:36:13	Hey, you remember this one, Dad?
646	00:36:13	00:36:16	As a matter of fact, I do.
647	00:36:18	00:36:22	Trying to soften me up, are you?
648	00:36:22	00:36:23	Is it working?
649	00:36:23	00:36:25	No.
650	00:36:25	00:36:28	Your coach called me this afternoon.
651	00:36:28	00:36:30	He's worried about you. He's worried about winning.
652	00:36:30	00:36:33	Well, he's supposed to, Charlie. He's the coach.
653	00:36:34	00:36:36	So why did you miss curfew?
654	00:36:36	00:36:38	I was bouldering up at Mt. Charleston.
655	00:36:38	00:36:40	I lost track of time. It was stupid.
656	00:36:40	00:36:41	I don't care what you were doing.
657	00:36:41	00:36:43	I want to know why, Charlie.
658	00:36:44	00:36:47	It's just...
659	00:36:47	00:36:48	the other players don't really get me.
660	00:36:50	00:36:51	It's different here, Dad.
661	00:36:55	00:36:57	Hey, you're the new kid on the team.
662	00:36:57	00:36:59	Everybody thinks you're a little weird.
663	00:36:59	00:37:00	Right?
664	00:37:00	00:37:03	Well, join the club.
665	00:37:05	00:37:06	We are weird.
666	00:37:11	00:37:14	Are you still having fun with basketball?
667	00:37:14	00:37:16	I love it. Good.
668	00:37:16	00:37:18	Apologize to your coach...
669	00:37:18	00:37:24	take your suspension with a smile, and, next game, you bring it.
670	00:37:24	00:37:26	Can you do that?
671	00:37:26	00:37:29	Yeah, I can do that.
672	00:37:29	00:37:31	Good.
673	00:37:38	00:37:40	Whew...
674	00:37:41	00:37:43	Hey, come here for a second, will you?
675	00:37:43	00:37:46	I promise, I promise, no more stories.
676	00:37:48	00:37:49	Okay, what's up?
677	00:37:49	00:37:51	This is driving me crazy.
678	00:37:51	00:37:54	Now, why did Clegg order a number 17?
679	00:37:54	00:37:56	Right? He was a nugget man.
680	00:37:56	00:37:59	He's high on drugs--he should have been thirsty, if anything.
681	00:37:59	00:38:01	Well, you know what's driving me nuts? What?
682	00:38:01	00:38:02	That football.
683	00:38:02	00:38:04	Why?
684	00:38:04	00:38:05	'Cause I played a little football.
685	00:38:05	00:38:07	I even got a game ball once.
686	00:38:07	00:38:09	They put my jersey number on it and everything.
687	00:38:09	00:38:11	And I still have that football; it's very important to me.
688	00:38:11	00:38:13	Maybe this is Clegg's game ball, right?
689	00:38:13	00:38:16	And he hung on to it, and his life is passing before his eyes.
690	00:38:16	00:38:18	He starts thinking about the good times.
691	00:38:18	00:38:20	I don't know, man. I read Clegg's bio.
692	00:38:20	00:38:21	He didn't even play football.
693	00:38:21	00:38:23	Yeah, but Dempsey did.
694	00:38:23	00:38:26	Maybe Dempsey gave Clegg his ball.
695	00:38:26	00:38:28	Why? I don't--I don't know, man.
696	00:38:28	00:38:30	Because they were good friends, I guess.
697	00:38:30	00:38:31	Wait, wait, go back.
698	00:38:31	00:38:36	All right, so Clegg is supposed to be getting rid of his friend's brain for Pernin, right?
699	00:38:36	00:38:40	But three hours after the swap, he's still driving around with it.
700	00:38:40	00:38:45	Maybe he's driving around with his friend's game ball for the same reason that he's driving around with his brain.
701	00:38:45	00:38:47	Maybe he's not trying to help Pernin.
702	00:38:47	00:38:49	Maybe he's trying to help his old friend.
703	00:38:49	00:38:55	You know what? You know-- There's a police station about-- about two blocks from the Tasty Time.
704	00:38:55	00:38:59	I'll bet you anything that he was gonna bust Pernin for drugs, and he died first.
705	00:38:59	00:39:02	Right? Wait--whoa, what are you doing?
706	00:39:02	00:39:05	I think it's about time to figure out how this football plays into all this, don't you?
707	00:39:05	00:39:08	Yeah, what the hell. Go for it.
708	00:39:16	00:39:18	Hold on.
709	00:39:25	00:39:28	I guess you never really know what's important.
710	00:39:56	00:39:57	Hey.
711	00:39:57	00:40:00	Print on the syringe got us a warrant to Pernin's house.
712	00:40:00	00:40:04	Found this in his sock drawer.
713	00:40:04	00:40:07	Let's see if his bullet matches the one that killed Eller.
714	00:40:12	00:40:14	Fire one.
715	00:40:43	00:40:45	Nice.
716	00:40:56	00:40:58	So we've got him dead to rights on the Eller murder.
717	00:40:58	00:41:00	But he won't flip on Joyce Dempsey.
718	00:41:00	00:41:03	Well, I guess he has a large capacity for love.
719	00:41:03	00:41:05	Joyce Dempsey's one lucky woman.
720	00:41:07	00:41:10	Want me to take a pass with the kid?
721	00:41:10	00:41:12	I got this one.
722	00:41:17	00:41:19	Everybody, I'd like a little privacy.
723	00:41:19	00:41:21	Thank you very much.
724	00:41:29	00:41:34	So remember when I told you I took a swing at my dad and I never felt better and never felt worse?
725	00:41:34	00:41:37	Well, the better lasted, like, 15 seconds.
726	00:41:37	00:41:39	The worse...
727	00:41:39	00:41:42	40 years, and counting.
728	00:41:42	00:41:46	No one in this life is all good or all bad.
729	00:41:46	00:41:48	Even my dad had a lot of good in him.
730	00:41:48	00:41:51	And I know you had a lot of good times with your dad too.
731	00:41:51	00:41:55	Now you got to try and help that dad.
732	00:41:55	00:41:56	The one who loved you.
733	00:41:58	00:42:03	Did your dad and mom have a fight at the cabin about Mr. Pernin?
734	00:42:03	00:42:04	They were always fighting.
735	00:42:04	00:42:07	Yeah, but this time your mom fought with a gun, right?
736	00:42:09	00:42:12	Come on, Deck...
737	00:42:12	00:42:14	remember the good.
738	00:42:14	00:42:15	There were no good times.
739	00:42:16	00:42:18	All I can remember is being scared.
740	00:42:18	00:42:20	Well, I'm sure your mom was scared too.
741	00:42:20	00:42:22	He threw me down the stairs.
742	00:42:22	00:42:24	You didn't think I'd find out? (Joyce shouts)
743	00:42:24	00:42:25	Everyone knows!
744	00:42:25	00:42:30	He was choking my mom and screaming and calling her names.
745	00:42:30	00:42:33	But I couldn't stop him.
746	00:42:36	00:42:38	And I know you think my mom did it...
747	00:42:38	00:42:41	Look, don't say another word.
748	00:42:41	00:42:43	I killed him.
749	00:42:43	00:42:44	Declan, no!
750	00:42:47	00:42:50	And, really, I've never felt better.
