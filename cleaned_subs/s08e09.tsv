0	00:00:19	00:00:23	Hey, bro, I'm driving drunk, and you're lighting up a J?
1	00:00:23	00:00:26	Maybe we should wait for those... hell, dude.
2	00:00:26	00:00:29	Man, we're in Vegas.
3	00:00:29	00:00:30	Sweet potato Vegas!
4	00:00:30	00:00:32	Whoo!
5	00:00:54	00:00:57	Hide that! Hide it! Hide it!
6	00:00:57	00:00:59	Get it out of here!
7	00:01:03	00:01:07	Hey, hide that liquor! Hide the liquor! Hide it!
8	00:01:07	00:01:09	Throw that joint out!
9	00:01:11	00:01:13	Get him! Get him!
10	00:01:13	00:01:15	Shoot him! Shoot him!
11	00:02:26	00:02:27	Get out of the way!
12	00:02:56	00:02:58	Hello?
13	00:02:59	00:03:00	Hello?
14	00:03:02	00:03:06	Unknown caller. No call list.
15	00:03:06	00:03:09	Probably disposable.
16	00:03:23	00:03:25	Where's Warrick?
17	00:03:25	00:03:27	We've been calling him. There's no answer.
18	00:03:27	00:03:32	See what happens when you get in a high-speed chase with a garbage truck and end up with two dead bodies.
19	00:03:32	00:03:34	Where's the other one?
20	00:03:37	00:03:39	I take it he came out of the truck?
21	00:03:39	00:03:40	He flew out.
22	00:03:40	00:03:42	At least that's what every eyewitness tells us.
23	00:03:42	00:03:45	Well, city landfill is a couple of miles down the road.
24	00:03:45	00:03:47	What's the TOD, David?
25	00:03:47	00:03:48	Nine, maybe ten, hours.
26	00:03:48	00:03:49	I got no ID on either of the bodies.
27	00:03:49	00:03:51	No ID on the truck.
28	00:03:51	00:03:52	I ran the VIN number and the plates.
29	00:03:52	00:03:54	They're not in the system.
30	00:03:54	00:03:55	Good luck.
31	00:03:56	00:03:59	Control Sanitation is the only waste company in Vegas.
32	00:03:59	00:04:02	If the garbageman works for them, his prints would be in the system.
33	00:04:02	00:04:04	All right. Catherine, you and I got the bodies.
34	00:04:06	00:04:08	the truck or the trail.
35	00:04:08	00:04:10	I'll go for the fresh air.
36	00:04:10	00:04:12	Do I get a choice, too?
37	00:04:12	00:04:15	Because, if you don't mind, I'm going to take the garbageman.
38	00:04:15	00:04:16	Be my guest.
39	00:04:19	00:04:21	I thought I told you not to call me on this line.
40	00:04:21	00:04:25	Maybe that's because I don't want to talk to you.
41	00:04:25	00:04:27	Are you kidding me?
42	00:04:27	00:04:31	Why don't you ask the father of your unborn child?
43	00:04:31	00:04:33	No. That's stupid. Don't call the lawyers.
44	00:04:33	00:04:36	Tina, don't call... Tina! Tina!
45	00:04:36	00:04:39	Don't call... Tina!
46	00:04:39	00:04:40	Damn it.
47	00:04:48	00:04:51	Hey, Gris, I'm sorry I'm late.
48	00:04:51	00:04:52	I had some business to take care of.
49	00:04:52	00:04:54	This is your business.
50	00:04:54	00:04:55	You were first up.
51	00:04:55	00:04:57	That means you're supposed to be here first.
52	00:04:57	00:04:59	You get to process the trash truck.
53	00:04:59	00:05:01	No problem.
54	00:05:01	00:05:03	But get it off the street.
55	00:05:03	00:05:05	Tow it to the impound yard.
56	00:05:15	00:05:19	and TOYOTA. Moving Forward.
57	00:05:54	00:05:56	These coveralls are brand-new.
58	00:05:59	00:06:01	Your garbageman was in excellent shape.
59	00:06:01	00:06:03	COD is as expected.
60	00:06:03	00:06:07	Massive BFT due to his unfortunate collision with the T-bird.
61	00:06:07	00:06:09	And your other vic was in his late 20s.
62	00:06:09	00:06:12	He was definitely crushed by something.
63	00:06:12	00:06:14	Most likely, the garbage compactor.
64	00:06:14	00:06:16	Which happened postmortem.
65	00:06:16	00:06:19	Oh, it's always better to be compacted dead rather than alive.
66	00:06:26	00:06:28	What's his COD?
67	00:06:28	00:06:31	Suffocation. He had petechial hemorrhaging.
68	00:06:31	00:06:34	I found white fibers in the nose and mouth.
69	00:06:34	00:06:35	Sent them over to Hodges.
70	00:06:35	00:06:37	He called back, confirmed they were silk.
71	00:06:37	00:06:39	I tried to trace garbageman's cell phone.
72	00:06:39	00:06:41	Like we expected, it's disposable.
73	00:06:41	00:06:42	So I tracked down the distributor.
74	00:06:42	00:06:45	It was paid for in cash under a bogus name.
75	00:06:45	00:06:48	But I did get an AFIS hit off his print.
76	00:06:48	00:06:50	Brody Biggs. Former cop.
77	00:06:50	00:06:52	When was this taken?
78	00:06:52	00:06:54	1975, police academy graduation.
79	00:06:54	00:07:00	I contacted LVPD. They said he quit the force back in 1980 with a perfect record.
80	00:07:00	00:07:01	Then what?
81	00:07:01	00:07:03	Social came back to several different garages around town.
82	00:07:04	00:07:05	He was a freelance mechanic for 20 years.
83	00:07:05	00:07:08	All right, we got to get his personnel file.
84	00:07:08	00:07:09	What about the other vic?
85	00:07:09	00:07:11	(typing) It's Jason Crewes.
86	00:07:11	00:07:13	27. Got a hit off his work card.
87	00:07:13	00:07:17	He's worked at five different casinos over the last six years.
88	00:07:22	00:07:26	Well, it doesn't look like Jason planned on going anywhere.
89	00:07:26	00:07:29	I know a lot of people in this phone.
90	00:07:29	00:07:32	You do not.
91	00:07:32	00:07:34	Knows some famous people.
92	00:07:34	00:07:39	Or uses famous nicknames for his friends.
93	00:08:36	00:08:39	Did you see anything?
94	00:09:38	00:09:40	Nick!
95	00:09:43	00:09:45	I think I just found ground zero.
96	00:09:45	00:09:47	I think Jason was killed here.
97	00:10:03	00:10:09	Well, this would have been the perfect murder if Jason's body would have actually made it to the landfill.
98	00:10:09	00:10:10	Would have been incinerated.
99	00:10:10	00:10:13	At least now his mother has someone to bury.
100	00:10:13	00:10:16	He was alone last night.
101	00:10:17	00:10:19	00 in the morning.
102	00:10:19	00:10:25	He said he got off work early and was going to bed, and he'd call me when he woke up.
103	00:10:25	00:10:29	But he never did.
104	00:10:29	00:10:31	Have you ever seen this man?
105	00:10:31	00:10:34	His name is Brody Biggs. He's a mechanic.
106	00:10:35	00:10:37	Are you sure?
107	00:10:37	00:10:39	We think this is the man that killed your son.
108	00:10:39	00:10:44	If he's a mechanic, maybe he worked on some of Jason's limos.
109	00:10:44	00:10:46	I thought Jason was a club owner.
110	00:10:46	00:10:49	He was a limo driver before that, long time ago.
111	00:10:49	00:10:52	Well, couldn't be that long ago.
112	00:10:52	00:10:55	Jason was only 27.
113	00:10:55	00:10:59	You have to be 25 to be a limo driver.
114	00:10:59	00:11:01	He had all kinds of fake IDs.
115	00:11:01	00:11:04	Drove his first long one at 18.
116	00:11:04	00:11:08	The owner of the limo company liked Jason.
117	00:11:08	00:11:10	Made him a VIP driver.
118	00:11:10	00:11:13	Celebs liked Jason.
119	00:11:13	00:11:18	He could take his clients to a Motel 6 and it'd be the hottest spot in town.
120	00:11:18	00:11:26	Wasn't long before the club owners invested in Jason, made him a group partner, gave him his own spot.
121	00:11:26	00:11:29	Then two, then five.
122	00:11:29	00:11:32	Suddenly, he's running the whole club scene.
123	00:11:35	00:11:40	I guess I should say he ran the club scene.
124	00:11:40	00:11:44	He's not going to be running anything anymore.
125	00:11:50	00:11:53	I'll be damned.
126	00:11:56	00:11:59	Look at that.
127	00:11:59	00:12:00	The good old days.
128	00:12:00	00:12:01	Yeah.
129	00:12:01	00:12:05	Here's an ad for the Silver Slipper Casino-- buffet.
130	00:12:05	00:12:09	Back when they had real eggs, not powdered ones.
131	00:12:09	00:12:12	Hey, Gris, listen. About me being late...
132	00:12:12	00:12:14	You have a cell phone paid for by the department.
133	00:12:14	00:12:16	You call, you say you're running late.
134	00:12:17	00:12:19	What's going on with you?
135	00:12:19	00:12:21	I don't know. This, uh...
136	00:12:21	00:12:23	This whole divorce has taken the wind out of my sails.
137	00:12:23	00:12:30	You know, I used to have the team to distract me from all this, but even that's changed with Sara being gone.
138	00:12:30	00:12:32	I feel kind of disconnected.
139	00:12:32	00:12:34	You've got your work.
140	00:12:34	00:12:36	Don't screw that up.
141	00:12:53	00:12:56	Van Halen, 1984.
142	00:12:59	00:13:05	Either this truck was delivering merchandise for a memorabilia store or it's just plain old.
143	00:13:05	00:13:07	Maybe that's why Brass couldn't find the registration record.
144	00:13:10	00:13:14	These old blue license plates were issued in the '80s.
145	00:13:14	00:13:17	I don't think this truck's been on the streets since.
146	00:13:49	00:13:51	I think this guy was disguising his truck.
147	00:13:51	00:13:55	It was orange before it was green.
148	00:13:55	00:13:57	They used to use orange garbage trucks in the '80s.
149	00:13:57	00:14:00	The hydraulic cylinder blew.
150	00:14:00	00:14:02	Maybe when he crushed the body.
151	00:14:05	00:14:08	That's why all the garbage flew out.
152	00:14:08	00:14:11	Found this .22 in the parking lot near the crash.
153	00:14:11	00:14:13	Check these bullets.
154	00:14:13	00:14:15	Shorts.
155	00:14:15	00:14:19	Usually used for shooting small animals, but in some cases they're used on people in place of a silencer.
156	00:14:19	00:14:20	Less gunpowder, less noise.
157	00:14:20	00:14:24	Look, if the garbageman had this gun, why didn't he just shoot the vic?
158	00:14:24	00:14:25	He found Jason sleeping.
159	00:14:25	00:14:27	Why make a mess if you don't have to?
160	00:14:27	00:14:28	Sounds like a professional hit man.
161	00:14:28	00:14:33	Well, if he was, we still have to find the guy who hired him.
162	00:14:37	00:14:41	I traced the VIN on the garbage truck back to The Regency, the company that made it.
163	00:14:41	00:14:45	The only model of that truck sold in Nevada was to a company called The Regal Sanitation Group.
164	00:14:45	00:14:47	They shut down in '83.
165	00:14:47	00:14:49	That explains the garbage.
166	00:14:49	00:14:53	Regal Sanitation was owned by Anthony Pezzulo.
167	00:14:53	00:14:55	I'm studying mob history for my book.
168	00:14:55	00:14:59	Pezzulo? Wasn't he the mob boss who owned the Starfly?
169	00:15:00	00:15:06	They called Pezzulo Whacko, not so much for his wacky personality as for his love for whacking guys.
170	00:15:06	00:15:11	Until he himself got whacked at the Wisconsin Dells in 1983.
171	00:15:11	00:15:16	Every mob-owned business in Vegas shut down when Pezzulo died.
172	00:15:16	00:15:17	These scumbags lay roaches.
173	00:15:17	00:15:19	Just when you think they're gone, they pop back up again.
174	00:15:19	00:15:23	Somebody put a hit out on Jason.
175	00:15:23	00:15:25	It couldn't have been Pezzulo 'cause he's been dead for 20 years.
176	00:15:25	00:15:29	Pezzulo's wife Kate got rid of Regal Sanitation right after he died.
177	00:15:29	00:15:30	She still around?
178	00:15:30	00:15:32	She fell off the radar.
179	00:15:32	00:15:34	All I could find was this old photo.
180	00:15:35	00:15:37	I told you the truth.
181	00:15:37	00:15:39	You lied about your name.
182	00:15:39	00:15:42	The feds told me to forget I ever had the Pezzulo name.
183	00:15:42	00:15:45	I wasn't about to remember it for you.
184	00:15:45	00:15:49	My husband had more cops than capos on his payroll.
185	00:15:49	00:15:51	So you went into witness protection.
186	00:15:51	00:15:53	You changed your identity.
187	00:15:53	00:15:54	And then you stayed in Vegas?
188	00:15:54	00:15:57	Feds felt we'd actually be safer here.
189	00:15:57	00:16:03	They thought if we left, we might suffer the same consequences as Anthony.
190	00:16:03	00:16:06	Did Jason have any mob ties?
191	00:16:06	00:16:11	Jason was three years old when Anthony died.
192	00:16:11	00:16:13	He never even knew his father.
193	00:16:13	00:16:19	The last time we talked you said you didn't know Jason's killer.
194	00:16:19	00:16:21	What about this guy?
195	00:16:26	00:16:28	That's B.B.
196	00:16:28	00:16:29	That's the same guy.
197	00:16:30	00:16:33	B.B. is short for Brody Biggs.
198	00:16:33	00:16:36	B.B. didn't kill Jason.
199	00:16:36	00:16:38	There's no way.
200	00:16:38	00:16:40	He was Anthony's friend.
201	00:16:40	00:16:44	Friend?
202	00:16:44	00:16:48	B.B. was driving one of your husband's old garbage trucks.
203	00:16:48	00:16:52	Your dead son was in the back with the rest of the garbage.
204	00:16:52	00:16:54	How did B.B. get the truck?
205	00:17:00	00:17:03	I haven't seen B.B. in 23 years.
206	00:17:03	00:17:05	You got rid of the business.
207	00:17:05	00:17:08	What happened to the trucks?
208	00:17:08	00:17:10	I gave that stuff to Lou Gedda.
209	00:17:10	00:17:14	The owner of Pigalle Boulevard Strip Club.
210	00:17:14	00:17:16	So did Gedda and B.B. know each other?
211	00:17:16	00:17:22	Of course, they were both on Anthony's crew, but they would never...
212	00:17:22	00:17:23	Never what?
213	00:17:23	00:17:28	Never kill your son and dispose of him in one of the trucks you gave him?
214	00:17:33	00:17:37	When was the last time you saw Gedda?
215	00:17:38	00:17:43	I haven't had any contact with him since Anthony died.
216	00:17:43	00:17:47	So you're telling me you haven't seen or spoken to Lou Gedda in 23 years?
217	00:17:50	00:17:53	Gedda and I had an agreement.
218	00:17:53	00:17:58	He was to keep away from our family.
219	00:17:58	00:18:02	Forget Jason and I ever existed.
220	00:18:04	00:18:07	Obviously, Lou Gedda is not a man of his word.
221	00:18:23	00:18:25	This place has always been bad news.
222	00:18:25	00:18:27	My guys are in here at least twice a week.
223	00:18:28	00:18:29	Yet there's always a line.
224	00:18:29	00:18:31	Never underestimate the power of the ass.
225	00:18:31	00:18:32	Look out. Coming through.
226	00:18:32	00:18:35	Excuse me, gentlemen.
227	00:19:12	00:19:14	Looking for Lou Gedda.
228	00:19:36	00:19:38	Yeah, come on in.
229	00:19:41	00:19:45	Who let you two up here?
230	00:19:45	00:19:46	Just so I know who to fire.
231	00:19:46	00:19:49	Gold card.
232	00:19:50	00:19:54	Oh, yeah, those seem to work everywhere.
233	00:19:54	00:19:56	Got to get me one.
234	00:19:56	00:19:57	Ahh...!
235	00:20:00	00:20:02	I know why you're here.
236	00:20:02	00:20:04	And I don't know what to say.
237	00:20:04	00:20:06	I can't control these girls.
238	00:20:06	00:20:10	They want to leave with customers and do whatever it is they do, I can't prevent that.
239	00:20:10	00:20:13	Believe me, I don't like whores.
240	00:20:13	00:20:15	I like dancers.
241	00:20:15	00:20:18	When I find out they're whores, I kick them curbside.
242	00:20:18	00:20:19	We're not here about your girls.
243	00:20:19	00:20:21	We're here about this guy.
244	00:20:21	00:20:23	B.B.
245	00:20:23	00:20:26	Yeah, works at my auto detailing.
246	00:20:26	00:20:31	But I tell ya, he's in here more, getting drunk and checking out the breast-est-es.
247	00:20:31	00:20:33	Well, you don't have to worry about him anymore. He's dead.
248	00:20:33	00:20:36	Oh. Well...
249	00:20:36	00:20:40	unless you invite me to the funeral, what's this got to do with me?
250	00:20:40	00:20:41	Tell me about Jason Crewes.
251	00:20:41	00:20:45	He brings me boatloads of celebrities, which equals boatloads of money.
252	00:20:45	00:20:47	I love the kid.
253	00:20:47	00:20:50	Oh, don't tell me.
254	00:20:50	00:20:51	You think Jason killed B.B.?
255	00:20:51	00:20:54	We think B.B. killed Jason.
256	00:20:54	00:20:58	Now, see, that makes more sense.
257	00:20:58	00:21:00	When is the last time you saw Jason Crewes, sir?
258	00:21:00	00:21:01	Last week.
259	00:21:01	00:21:03	How long have you known him?
260	00:21:03	00:21:04	A couple years at most.
261	00:21:05	00:21:07	I still don't understand what this has to do with me.
262	00:21:07	00:21:09	You missing a garbage truck?
263	00:21:09	00:21:10	Go again?
264	00:21:10	00:21:12	Regal Sanitation Group.
265	00:21:12	00:21:13	Your buddy Pezzulo's old company.
266	00:21:14	00:21:15	You inherited the trucks.
267	00:21:15	00:21:17	So what?
268	00:21:17	00:21:20	Jason Crewes' corpse flew out of one of your trucks earlier this morning.
269	00:21:20	00:21:22	Do you know how much this club made last year?
270	00:21:22	00:21:23	30 mill.
271	00:21:23	00:21:25	You think I'm still messing around with trash?
272	00:21:25	00:21:27	And that's the end of this.
273	00:21:27	00:21:33	You want to continue asking me questions, you're going to have to do it with my dream team present.
274	00:22:10	00:22:11	Here you go.
275	00:22:11	00:22:13	Thank you.
276	00:22:13	00:22:16	So you're the talented Mr. Raykirk, agent to the stars.
277	00:22:16	00:22:16	Uh-uh, manager.
278	00:22:16	00:22:18	What's the difference?
279	00:22:18	00:22:22	Uh, well, an agent gets ten percent and a manager gets 15.
280	00:22:22	00:22:29	Listen, I'm here in town for a film festival and I have to get to a screening, so you can you just, you know, cut to the chase?
281	00:22:31	00:22:33	Jason Crewes is dead.
282	00:22:35	00:22:37	Okay.
283	00:22:40	00:22:45	Um... So he took you to Pigalle Boulevard in August.
284	00:22:45	00:22:46	Do you remember that?
285	00:22:46	00:22:48	How do you know about that?
286	00:22:48	00:22:49	I'm an investigator.
287	00:22:49	00:22:52	Some things I do know, but there's a lot that I don't.
288	00:22:52	00:22:54	Somebody put a hit out on your friend.
289	00:22:54	00:22:55	You want to help us out here?
290	00:22:55	00:23:03	I have an agent friend who I work with who had a bachelor party out here, and Jason hooked us up VIP-style.
291	00:23:06	00:23:12	He took us to Moon and LAX and Drai's and then of course, naturally, we ended up at a strip club.
292	00:23:12	00:23:16	And everyone knows the best girls are at Pigalle Boulevard.
293	00:23:19	00:23:24	It couldn't get any better until the check showed up.
294	00:23:24	00:23:25	Ten grand?
295	00:23:25	00:23:26	The manager said $800 a bottle.
296	00:23:26	00:23:28	We ordered five.
297	00:23:29	00:23:31	I hear you don't want to pay what you owe us.
298	00:23:31	00:23:33	No. No, no, no, no.
299	00:23:33	00:23:35	I just think you overcharged us, man.
300	00:23:35	00:23:36	No.
301	00:23:39	00:23:40	This place is a rip-off.
302	00:23:40	00:23:41	And your girls?
303	00:23:41	00:23:45	They're beat, overrated, and oversized.
304	00:23:45	00:23:46	Get it?
305	00:23:46	00:23:48	I'm not paying.
306	00:23:48	00:23:50	Let's take a walk.
307	00:24:01	00:24:05	I'm gonna give you a minute so you can figure out what you want to do.
308	00:24:05	00:24:08	I'm cutting something.
309	00:24:08	00:24:10	But I'm gonna give you the choice of what it's gonna be.
310	00:24:10	00:24:11	No. Oh, yeah, yeah.
311	00:24:11	00:24:14	I can slice you here or I can slice you here.
312	00:24:14	00:24:16	(sobbing) Come on, no, no, no.
313	00:24:16	00:24:17	Shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh.
314	00:24:18	00:24:19	Come on, you choose.
315	00:24:19	00:24:21	I mean, I was never more scared in my life.
316	00:24:21	00:24:26	You know, he was so sweet enough to give me the choice of my throat or my genitals, so I chose the latter...
317	00:24:26	00:24:28	so I'd live.
318	00:24:28	00:24:31	Then he charged my card and escorted us out to the parking lot.
319	00:24:31	00:24:33	Oh, here's something really cool.
320	00:24:33	00:24:38	I left with a broken nose, some sore wrists, and some really nice bruises underneath my arms.
321	00:24:39	00:24:42	And I just should've given him the ten grand because I paid my plastic surgeon twice that.
322	00:24:42	00:24:44	And you told Jason about all this?
323	00:24:44	00:24:46	Oh, yeah.
324	00:24:46	00:24:49	I mean, he gave this guy Gedda a call right in front of me.
325	00:24:49	00:24:54	Then he cursed him out and he told him he would never take anyone to Pigalle anymore.
326	00:24:54	00:24:58	Listen, I'm really sorry about all this.
327	00:24:58	00:25:01	But, um, thanks a lot for your time. Oh, yeah.
328	00:25:01	00:25:05	By the way, if you're gonna prosecute this guy, I'm not a witness.
329	00:25:05	00:25:09	There's a reason that I didn't press charges, if you know what I mean.
330	00:25:30	00:25:31	Four shots.
331	00:26:05	00:26:06	Got an IBIS hit off that gun.
332	00:26:06	00:26:07	Unsolved murder in '93.
333	00:26:08	00:26:09	Victim was found in the desert.
334	00:26:09	00:26:12	His car was found at Pigalle Boulevard, the last place anyone saw him.
335	00:26:12	00:26:14	Our hit man's good for two murders.
336	00:26:14	00:26:18	The unsolved in '93, where he actually used a gun, and Jason Crewes, who he suffocated.
337	00:26:19	00:26:20	So, who hired him?
338	00:26:20	00:26:22	I have a good feeling he works for Gedda.
339	00:26:22	00:26:24	Yeah, but we don't work off feelings, do we?
340	00:26:24	00:26:33	According to Mr. Hollywood, Jason cost Gedda a lot of money, and he dissed him, which is more than enough for Gedda to order out a hit on someone, even if Jason is Pezzulo's son.
341	00:26:33	00:26:34	Any evidence?
342	00:26:34	00:26:38	I ran Pigalle's address to find out if there are any more crimes linked to it over the years.
343	00:26:38	00:26:41	416s, 413s, 411s...
344	00:26:41	00:26:43	The list goes on.
345	00:26:43	00:26:44	Any consistent suspects?
346	00:26:44	00:26:48	Only thing consistent is that the victims refused to file charges and the witnesses refused to give statements.
347	00:26:49	00:26:52	And it's funny enough the cops lost interest in pursuing it.
348	00:26:52	00:26:54	What are you saying?
349	00:26:54	00:26:59	I'm saying it looks like Gedda is running an old school extortion racket, and you can't do that without having cops on the payroll.
350	00:27:43	00:27:45	Hey!
351	00:27:45	00:27:47	I just want to talk!
352	00:27:47	00:27:49	I got warrants, man!
353	00:27:49	00:27:50	I'm not a cop.
354	00:27:50	00:27:52	I don't care. You got a piece.
355	00:27:52	00:27:54	Calm down. I'm not going to hurt you.
356	00:27:54	00:27:55	You live here? Pretty much.
357	00:27:55	00:27:57	What do you want?
358	00:27:57	00:27:58	You ever see anybody get beat up inside?
359	00:27:58	00:28:00	No, no, I never seen none of that.
360	00:28:00	00:28:01	Don't make me pull those warrants, man.
361	00:28:02	00:28:03	Yeah, I seen guys get beat up.
362	00:28:03	00:28:04	This is Strip Club Strip.
363	00:28:04	00:28:06	Guys get beat up and down this block.
364	00:28:06	00:28:08	You ever see the owner beat up anyone?
365	00:28:08	00:28:09	Hey, they let me stay here.
366	00:28:09	00:28:11	They're real good to me.
367	00:28:11	00:28:13	I didn't ask you that.
368	00:28:13	00:28:17	Lot of troublemakers, they come out of there and they get hauled off.
369	00:28:17	00:28:19	That's all I know.
370	00:28:19	00:28:21	What do you mean by hauled off?
371	00:29:25	00:29:27	You got a warrant?
372	00:29:27	00:29:28	Do I need one?
373	00:29:28	00:29:30	I own this block.
374	00:29:30	00:29:34	Unless you're lookin' to get a detail job, you're trespassing.
375	00:29:34	00:29:35	What do you do with this?
376	00:29:35	00:29:37	I burn meat.
377	00:30:13	00:30:15	Hey. Hey.
378	00:30:15	00:30:16	What's up?
379	00:30:16	00:30:19	Trying to get this warrant for Gedda's property.
380	00:30:19	00:30:22	I'm getting close though.
381	00:30:22	00:30:25	Check out these bruise patterns.
382	00:30:25	00:30:26	Hey, what are those?
383	00:30:26	00:30:27	What?
384	00:30:27	00:30:28	Those pills?
385	00:30:29	00:30:31	Oh, they're supposed to keep me alert.
386	00:30:31	00:30:32	Really? Yeah.
387	00:30:32	00:30:34	How long you been taking those?
388	00:30:34	00:30:37	I don't know, for a couple months.
389	00:30:37	00:30:41	Aren't you still taking those sleeping pills, too?
390	00:30:41	00:30:43	What's it to you?
391	00:30:46	00:30:50	So now... you're taking uppers and downers.
392	00:30:50	00:30:53	Gimme a break, man.
393	00:30:53	00:30:56	No, you need to give yourself a break, Warrick.
394	00:30:56	00:30:58	Hey, let it go, bro.
395	00:30:58	00:31:02	No. No, I'm not going to let it go.
396	00:31:02	00:31:04	(pills clattering) What are you doing, man?
397	00:31:04	00:31:07	You need to take a look at yourself, Warrick.
398	00:31:08	00:31:10	And I care because I'm your friend.
399	00:31:21	00:31:23	All right? Yeah.
400	00:31:25	00:31:28	All right, tell me about these bruises.
401	00:31:28	00:31:33	The 415 vic claims he got beat up inside the Pigalle.
402	00:31:33	00:31:35	Couple days later, he dropped all the charges.
403	00:31:35	00:31:38	And then there's the unsolved murder.
404	00:31:38	00:31:42	They find a vic out in the desert, but they find his car outside of Pigalle's.
405	00:31:42	00:31:44	Same bruise pattern.
406	00:31:44	00:31:48	Now we got this Hollywood agent who mentions that he also has bruises under his arms.
407	00:31:48	00:31:53	He claims that he was strapped to a barber's chair in Gedda's office.
408	00:31:53	00:31:56	That should be enough for a warrant.
409	00:32:00	00:32:03	The judge doesn't think the bruises are enough probable cause to issue a warrant.
410	00:32:03	00:32:05	What judge?
411	00:32:05	00:32:06	Greene.
412	00:32:06	00:32:09	When I was running bets for Judge Cohen, she was in on the action.
413	00:32:09	00:32:11	I have no comment.
414	00:32:11	00:32:18	You know, these club owners-- they pay a lot of taxes; they fund campaigns; they hand out free drinks, all in exchange for protection.
415	00:32:19	00:32:20	I mean, what can I do?
416	00:32:20	00:32:25	Go to the Undersheriff, see if he can use his influence.
417	00:32:25	00:32:27	But I doubt it.
418	00:32:36	00:32:38	Excuse me.
419	00:32:39	00:32:42	McKeen!
420	00:32:42	00:32:44	Excuse me a moment.
421	00:32:44	00:32:45	Judge denied me the warrant.
422	00:32:45	00:32:46	What do you want me to do?
423	00:32:47	00:32:48	Get me the warrant.
424	00:32:48	00:32:49	Lou Gedda is getting away with murder.
425	00:32:49	00:32:51	All right, say that I get you the warrant.
426	00:32:51	00:32:54	What are you looking for, something that made armpit bruises?
427	00:32:54	00:32:57	The barber's chair in Gedda's office made the armpit bruises.
428	00:32:58	00:33:01	I'm agreeing with the judge.
429	00:33:01	00:33:03	Grissom!
430	00:33:05	00:33:08	You need to save your CSI here.
431	00:33:08	00:33:11	What he has is circumstantial based off of weird bruises and a barber chair.
432	00:33:11	00:33:16	Brown needs to get better evidence and leave the rest in our hands.
433	00:33:16	00:33:19	I'm sorry, leave what in your hands-- Gedda's money?
434	00:33:22	00:33:24	Listen to me.
435	00:33:24	00:33:26	Putting Gedda in jail is not gonna solve your problems.
436	00:33:26	00:33:28	You just got the rest of the night off.
437	00:34:06	00:34:07	Hey! (gasps)
438	00:34:07	00:34:09	What's in the bag?
439	00:34:09	00:34:10	All my stuff.
440	00:34:10	00:34:12	I'm just cleaning out my locker.
441	00:34:12	00:34:15	Show me.
442	00:34:23	00:34:25	Here, let me help you with that.
443	00:34:36	00:34:37	Thanks.
444	00:34:37	00:34:39	I'm sorry.
445	00:35:05	00:35:06	What can I get you tonight?
446	00:35:06	00:35:08	Got any Dom Perignon?
447	00:35:08	00:35:09	Mm-hmm.
448	00:35:09	00:35:11	What about Cristal? We do.
449	00:35:11	00:35:12	We also have DP Rose.
450	00:35:12	00:35:14	I'll take one of each.
451	00:35:47	00:35:48	Hey... Hey!
452	00:35:48	00:35:49	I'm sorry about earlier.
453	00:35:49	00:35:52	I thought you were carrying a dead body in there or something.
454	00:35:52	00:35:54	You're a cop, right?
455	00:35:54	00:35:56	I'm Warrick Brown.
456	00:35:56	00:35:58	I'm Candy.
457	00:35:58	00:35:59	Nice to meet you, Candy.
458	00:35:59	00:36:00	So, you work here?
459	00:36:00	00:36:04	Yeah.
460	00:36:04	00:36:05	What do you want?
461	00:36:05	00:36:08	Everything.
462	00:36:21	00:36:22	Hey, cheers, girl.
463	00:36:22	00:36:25	Hey, let's get out of here, you and me.
464	00:36:25	00:36:26	I'm working.
465	00:36:26	00:36:29	Come on, I just want to ask you a few questions.
466	00:36:29	00:36:31	I don't go home with the customers.
467	00:36:33	00:36:35	Pay the bill and let's go.
468	00:36:37	00:36:39	How'd you know I was here?
469	00:36:39	00:36:41	You've been here twice already today. We're leaving.
470	00:36:41	00:36:44	Come on, Gris, why don't you sit down and have a drink with us?
471	00:36:44	00:36:45	I'm on the clock.
472	00:36:45	00:36:46	So am I.
473	00:36:47	00:36:48	So you want to get fired.
474	00:36:48	00:36:50	No, I want to let them know I'm here.
475	00:36:50	00:36:53	I figured I'd order a couple bottles and not pay for it and see what happens.
476	00:36:53	00:36:55	You think he's that stupid?
477	00:36:55	00:36:57	It's worth a try.
478	00:36:57	00:36:59	Here you go, sir.
479	00:36:59	00:37:01	Thank you.
480	00:37:05	00:37:09	Well, now you gotta pay for it, 'cause we're not allowed to accept gifts.
481	00:37:09	00:37:11	I left my car.
482	00:37:11	00:37:13	I gotta get my car.
483	00:37:13	00:37:18	You gotta admit, though, once I get this done...
484	00:37:18	00:37:21	Get in the car, Warrick.
485	00:37:21	00:37:24	Go on.
486	00:37:24	00:37:25	Go home. Sleep it off.
487	00:37:25	00:37:27	I'll see you in my office in the morning.
488	00:38:00	00:38:02	Hey... follow that girl.
489	00:38:37	00:38:38	Thanks.
490	00:38:43	00:38:45	You don't give up.
491	00:38:45	00:38:46	Not tonight.
492	00:38:46	00:38:48	Irish whiskey. Neat.
493	00:38:48	00:38:50	What's your real name, Candy?
494	00:38:50	00:38:52	Joanna Krumsky.
495	00:38:52	00:38:55	Joanna. I'll stick with Candy.
496	00:38:56	00:39:01	So, now that we're out of the Pigalle, you can help me out with a few questions.
497	00:39:01	00:39:03	Good luck.
498	00:39:04	00:39:06	Anybody ever get heavy-handed with you over there?
499	00:39:06	00:39:10	Not with me. I'm a black belt.
500	00:39:10	00:39:11	Nice.
501	00:39:11	00:39:13	Not even the owner, Gedda?
502	00:39:13	00:39:15	Not even him.
503	00:39:17	00:39:19	Thanks.
504	00:39:23	00:39:26	So what about the customer? They ever get beat-downs?
505	00:39:26	00:39:29	When the guys get drunk and start groping the girls.
506	00:39:29	00:39:31	That's not tolerated.
507	00:39:31	00:39:34	You ever see a barber's chair in Gedda's office?
508	00:39:34	00:39:35	No, but I heard about one.
509	00:39:36	00:39:37	It's supposed to be Al Capone's.
510	00:39:37	00:39:38	Al Capone.
511	00:39:38	00:39:40	Yeah, but that has to be a rumor.
512	00:39:40	00:39:44	Mob guy with Al Capone's chair-- it's so clichÃ©.
513	00:39:44	00:39:47	Gedda's like the last wise guy left in Vegas.
514	00:39:47	00:39:50	Guess that's his way of keeping his culture alive.
515	00:39:50	00:39:51	Scumbags like him don't have culture.
516	00:39:51	00:39:55	Scumbags like him started Vegas.
517	00:39:55	00:39:58	None of these lights would be here if it wasn't for them.
518	00:39:58	00:40:02	What's a hot young thing like you doing working in a nasty place like that?
519	00:40:02	00:40:04	Money.
520	00:40:04	00:40:06	The hours.
521	00:40:06	00:40:08	The dancing.
522	00:40:08	00:40:12	How about you giving me that last dance of the evening?
523	00:40:21	00:40:25	Relax. It's just for your protection.
524	00:40:25	00:40:27	It's just for protection.
525	00:41:37	00:41:39	Just for your protection.
526	00:42:31	00:42:33	Thanks.
527	00:42:51	00:42:53	No, no, no! You can't cross the tape!
528	00:42:53	00:42:54	Not this time.
529	00:42:54	00:42:56	This is your car.
530	00:43:01	00:43:06	No! No!
531	00:43:06	00:43:07	No, this is wrong!
532	00:43:07	00:43:09	She didn't do anything!
