0	00:01:11	00:01:13	Here you go.
1	00:01:24	00:01:25	Yeah!
2	00:01:37	00:01:39	Come on, come on.
3	00:02:49	00:02:51	Help!
4	00:04:51	00:04:54	How many times we gotta go through this story, all right?
5	00:04:54	00:04:56	I didn't do nothing. I just got off of work down there, right?
6	00:04:56	00:04:59	Couple of blocks to the house, I'm going by here, I see the body, I call you-- that's it.
7	00:05:00	00:05:01	Hey, I'm not accusing you of anything, just...
8	00:05:02	00:05:03	Hang on to him.
9	00:05:03	00:05:05	That's the guy that found the body.
10	00:05:05	00:05:08	He's a janitor at Planet Hollywood.
11	00:05:17	00:05:19	Nice jacket and matching boots.
12	00:05:19	00:05:21	Where's the purse?
13	00:05:21	00:05:24	We haven't found it-- we don't have an ID on her yet.
14	00:05:27	00:05:28	Her name is Sylvia.
15	00:05:28	00:05:29	Sylvia Mallick.
16	00:05:29	00:05:32	She's a graduate student at WLVU.
17	00:05:32	00:05:36	She was studying criminal pathology, and she was one of my students.
18	00:05:54	00:05:56	I'm leaving the university.
19	00:05:56	00:05:58	Why?
20	00:05:58	00:05:59	Well, an opportunity came up.
21	00:05:59	00:06:02	It's not something I was looking for or even anything...
22	00:06:02	00:06:08	I expected. But you're my thesis advisor, and I've been working up some really great ideas for possible topics. Yes, I know.
23	00:06:08	00:06:10	You haven't even heard them yet.
24	00:06:10	00:06:11	Look, I know you.
25	00:06:12	00:06:13	I spoke with Dr. Jameison.
26	00:06:13	00:06:16	He said that he'd be happy to take you on.
27	00:06:16	00:06:19	Oh, Jameison's okay, but I wanted it to be you.
28	00:06:19	00:06:23	Your seminar is the reason I went into criminalistics in the first place.
29	00:06:24	00:06:29	Well, I'm happy to take the credit, but with a mind like yours, you would have ended up there eventually.
30	00:06:29	00:06:33	Sometimes a profession finds you.
31	00:06:33	00:06:34	I'm not abandoning you, Sylvia.
32	00:06:35	00:06:39	If there's anything you ever want to discuss, all you have to do is call.
33	00:06:40	00:06:43	Well, I intend to abuse the privilege.
34	00:06:43	00:06:47	So, what's this big opportunity?
35	00:06:47	00:06:49	I'm joining the Crime Lab.
36	00:06:49	00:06:51	You're going to be a CSI?
37	00:06:51	00:06:53	I am.
38	00:07:01	00:07:03	Doesn't look like she was raped.
39	00:07:03	00:07:05	Wet mount is negative.
40	00:07:05	00:07:08	No signs of sexual trauma.
41	00:07:32	00:07:33	Well, it's definitely leather.
42	00:07:33	00:07:35	Yeah.
43	00:07:35	00:07:36	And...
44	00:07:36	00:07:41	finely grained, and judging from the cracks, fairly old.
45	00:07:41	00:07:43	You know, that actually looks like it's some kind of fringe.
46	00:07:43	00:07:45	Maybe it's from a biker jacket.
47	00:07:45	00:07:49	Eh. It could be from a boot or a purse or a glove.
48	00:07:49	00:07:51	Or from a very small cow.
49	00:07:52	00:07:52	Probably that.
50	00:07:53	00:07:54	Mm-hmm. Yeah.
51	00:07:54	00:07:56	Hey, I'm done.
52	00:07:56	00:07:57	Good.
53	00:07:57	00:07:59	Hodges? Mm-hmm?
54	00:07:59	00:08:01	Why are you still standing there?
55	00:08:01	00:08:04	That's a good question. Mm-hmm.
56	00:08:04	00:08:06	COD is spinal shock.
57	00:08:06	00:08:19	The killer fractured three cervical vertebrae-- C3, C4 and C5-- severely transecting the spinal cord, which led to a sudden and profound drop in blood pressure.
58	00:08:21	00:08:24	Death was relatively quick.
59	00:08:25	00:08:28	I pulled a heart blood sample, sent it to Tox.
60	00:08:29	00:08:32	It'll come back negative-- she wasn't a party girl.
61	00:08:48	00:08:52	We got Sylvia Mallick's phone records from her cell company server.
62	00:08:52	00:08:58	She received over half a dozen calls from one person, just a few hours before she died.
63	00:09:00	00:09:02	You know him?
64	00:09:02	00:09:04	Yeah.
65	00:09:19	00:09:21	Professor Langston.
66	00:09:21	00:09:23	What's going on?
67	00:09:23	00:09:25	Can you take a break?
68	00:09:25	00:09:27	No, actually-- we're short at the bar.
69	00:09:27	00:09:28	Everyone's kind of sick.
70	00:09:28	00:09:30	I need to speak with you about Sylvia.
71	00:09:31	00:09:33	Sounds like she's been speaking to you about me.
72	00:09:33	00:09:36	I thought you were no longer her advisor.
73	00:09:36	00:09:38	Are you still seeing each other?
74	00:09:38	00:09:39	That's personal.
75	00:09:39	00:09:42	I'm not gonna ask you again, Dan.
76	00:09:42	00:09:45	Yeah, I'm still seeing her-- we live together.
77	00:09:45	00:09:47	When was the last time you saw her?
78	00:09:47	00:09:48	Last night when I came to work.
79	00:09:48	00:09:53	She said she'd come and hang out with me for a little bit while I, you know, I was at the bar.
80	00:09:53	00:09:56	But I guess she had better things to do.
81	00:09:56	00:10:00	Said it was for research-- she's been doing a lot of research lately.
82	00:10:00	00:10:02	Did you talk to her after that?
83	00:10:02	00:10:04	I called her a few times.
84	00:10:04	00:10:05	But this is what happens.
85	00:10:05	00:10:11	We get into a fight, she runs away, turns her phone off, spends the night at a girlfriend's house, and calls me back whenever.
86	00:10:11	00:10:13	And, you know, it's getting old.
87	00:10:13	00:10:15	Why do you care about all this?
88	00:10:16	00:10:17	She's dead.
89	00:10:19	00:10:21	Now, do you have any idea where she was going?
90	00:10:21	00:10:25	No. Can you tell me what she was researching?
91	00:10:25	00:10:27	I don't know.
92	00:10:27	00:10:29	Tell me something, Dan-- you lived with her.
93	00:10:29	00:10:31	What was she involved with? I don't know, she...
94	00:10:31	00:10:33	She kept all of her stuff in her office on campus.
95	00:10:33	00:10:35	It was another excuse to leave the apartment.
96	00:11:03	00:11:05	It's unlocked, but not cleared.
97	00:11:14	00:11:16	We're good.
98	00:12:40	00:12:43	Shouldn't you be out catching bad guys?
99	00:12:43	00:12:44	Shouldn't you be working on your thesis?
100	00:12:44	00:12:47	(chuckles) Oh, it's about all I do these days.
101	00:12:47	00:12:49	(chuckles) Can't believe you still come here.
102	00:12:49	00:12:51	This place holds a certain power for me.
103	00:12:51	00:12:53	I've killed a lot of lattes here.
104	00:12:54	00:12:56	That's a very different look for you. Mm.
105	00:12:56	00:12:57	Do you miss the suit?
106	00:12:57	00:12:59	I miss my students.
107	00:12:59	00:13:01	How's life?
108	00:13:01	00:13:04	Life or school?
109	00:13:04	00:13:05	You tell me.
110	00:13:05	00:13:10	Life's kind of complicated, I guess, but school's okay.
111	00:13:10	00:13:14	Professor Jameison decided to go on sabbatical, so I've pretty much been alone.
112	00:13:14	00:13:15	I was gonna call you, actually.
113	00:13:15	00:13:17	Well, now you don't have to.
114	00:13:17	00:13:19	I need a little favor.
115	00:13:19	00:13:23	I need some crime scene photos from a couple of unsolved homicides.
116	00:13:23	00:13:24	May I ask why?
117	00:13:25	00:13:26	My research.
118	00:13:26	00:13:28	May I ask what subject?
119	00:13:28	00:13:32	I don't have to tell you that; you're not my adviser anymore.
120	00:13:32	00:13:37	But I'll have you read it as soon as it's done, I promise, if you promise to help me get it published in JFS.
121	00:13:37	00:13:40	I'll tell you that once I've read it.
122	00:13:40	00:13:42	But I'll see what I can do.
123	00:13:42	00:13:44	I know a lot of people in the morgue.
124	00:13:44	00:13:46	What can I get you?
125	00:13:46	00:13:48	I'll have a coffee.
126	00:13:48	00:13:58	All of these women were murdered approximately 11 years ago-- a dental hygienist, a manicurist, both from LA, and a blackjack dealer from Vegas.
127	00:13:58	00:13:59	Yes, I remember this.
128	00:13:59	00:14:01	Serial case.
129	00:14:01	00:14:05	All Hispanic, all physically similar.
130	00:14:05	00:14:09	And every one with a severed C3, four and five vertebrae.
131	00:14:09	00:14:10	The Southwest Stalker.
132	00:14:10	00:14:14	The Feds ran a task force, but abandoned it when the bodies stopped turning up.
133	00:14:14	00:14:17	But Sylvia doesn't physically fit the profile.
134	00:14:17	00:14:19	I think Sylvia was more than a victim in this case.
135	00:14:19	00:14:24	I think she was investigating it, and she got too close to the killer and ended up dead.
136	00:14:24	00:14:26	We never found the purse at the scene.
137	00:14:26	00:14:32	Maybe the killer got into her office, grabbed her research to cover his tracks.
138	00:14:32	00:14:35	Any DNA from that leather fragment?
139	00:14:35	00:14:36	Sample's a mixture.
140	00:14:36	00:14:38	Multiple contributors.
141	00:14:38	00:14:39	Can't even run it through CODIS.
142	00:14:39	00:14:44	All the Hispanic vics had traces of atropine, scopalamine and hyoscyamine in their systems.
143	00:14:44	00:14:45	Consistent with plant-based hallucinogens.
144	00:14:46	00:14:47	Yeah.
145	00:14:47	00:14:48	Genus datura.
146	00:14:48	00:14:49	That's nasty stuff.
147	00:14:49	00:14:52	If ingested, the effects can be stronger than LSD.
148	00:14:52	00:14:53	Yeah.
149	00:14:53	00:14:54	It was in Sylvia's system, too.
150	00:14:54	00:14:59	And Hodges found traces of powdered datura on the piece of leather in her hand.
151	00:14:59	00:15:02	Datura's an odd drug to incapacitate a victim with.
152	00:15:02	00:15:06	It's used in SanterÃ­a and vodun rituals to speak with the dead.
153	00:15:06	00:15:08	Where might someone get their hands on it locally?
154	00:15:08	00:15:09	I don't know, but I'm sure Narco does.
155	00:15:09	00:15:11	Thank you.
156	00:15:26	00:15:28	How many more of these do we got to run down?
157	00:15:28	00:15:30	Tired of Northtown already?
158	00:15:30	00:15:31	Yeah.
159	00:15:31	00:15:36	Don't worry, Jim, Narco only had half a dozen known datura dealers on their books.
160	00:15:42	00:15:45	Las Vegas Police!
161	00:15:52	00:15:54	Oh, man.
162	00:16:01	00:16:03	Hi. How are you?
163	00:16:08	00:16:09	Well, we don't have a warrant, you know.
164	00:16:09	00:16:11	I'll put some surveillance on this.
165	00:16:11	00:16:12	We'll see what happens, okay?
166	00:16:12	00:16:13	All right.
167	00:16:15	00:16:17	What was that? Wait a minute.
168	00:16:21	00:16:24	Las Vegas Police!
169	00:16:24	00:16:26	iAbre la puerta!
170	00:16:35	00:16:38	Policia. Por favor.
171	00:18:07	00:18:10	Brown powder; that looks like datura.
172	00:18:10	00:18:11	Yeah.
173	00:18:13	00:18:16	Okay, everybody, the party's over.
174	00:19:01	00:19:04	This is all the surveillance I got from the night of the murder.
175	00:19:04	00:19:07	All right, that's her in the parking lot of the Golden Gate Hotel.
176	00:19:10	00:19:12	Have you got something else?
177	00:19:12	00:19:14	Yeah, got her in a few different places.
178	00:19:19	00:19:20	My goodness.
179	00:19:20	00:19:23	She almost got hit.
180	00:19:23	00:19:24	Oh.
181	00:19:24	00:19:28	That looks like her. Freeze it.
182	00:19:28	00:19:31	Go in tighter.
183	00:19:31	00:19:32	Tighter.
184	00:19:34	00:19:36	That's her.
185	00:19:36	00:19:37	That's Sylvia.
186	00:19:39	00:19:41	Anything else?
187	00:19:41	00:19:42	Yeah.
188	00:19:42	00:19:45	I think I have her over here.
189	00:19:47	00:19:49	All right, here she comes.
190	00:19:49	00:19:52	Here she comes.
191	00:19:52	00:19:54	Good, good, freeze that.
192	00:19:54	00:19:56	Okay, blow her up.
193	00:19:57	00:19:59	No, no, tighter, tighter.
194	00:20:01	00:20:03	That's about as much as I can get.
195	00:20:05	00:20:06	Can you back her up?
196	00:20:17	00:20:18	Good. Now bring her forward again.
197	00:20:24	00:20:25	She came from there.
198	00:20:25	00:20:26	Now, what is that?
199	00:20:28	00:20:30	I don't know.
200	00:20:30	00:20:32	There's not much resolution.
201	00:20:32	00:20:34	Blow it up again.
202	00:20:36	00:20:37	Again.
203	00:20:40	00:20:42	What does that sign say?
204	00:20:42	00:20:44	Where is this?
205	00:20:44	00:20:46	Uh...
206	00:20:49	00:20:51	The corner of Harmon and Pinchard.
207	00:20:51	00:20:54	What the hell was she doing in that neighborhood?
208	00:20:54	00:20:56	I don't know, but we're gonna find out.
209	00:20:56	00:20:57	Vamos a luchar!
210	00:21:54	00:21:56	Hombre, dale bien en la zapatilla!
211	00:21:56	00:21:57	Es lo que le pasa.
212	00:21:57	00:21:59	Tiralo! Tiralo!
213	00:22:02	00:22:04	Arriba, arriba!
214	00:22:12	00:22:13	Yeah!
215	00:22:29	00:22:31	Ooh! Oh! Oh!
216	00:22:31	00:22:33	Ay, mira eso! Mira! Â¿Verdad que si?
217	00:22:36	00:22:38	Â¿Que piensan ustedes?
218	00:22:50	00:22:52	Â¿Que piensan ustedes?
219	00:23:11	00:23:13	Â¿Que pasa?
220	00:23:28	00:23:32	We're investigating the murder of a young woman and we're talking to everyone that we can.
221	00:23:32	00:23:35	She was last seen alive here.
222	00:23:35	00:23:42	She was found about three blocks from here, abandoned construction site, so, um...
223	00:23:42	00:23:44	We need your cooperation.
224	00:23:46	00:23:48	And what does the girl have to do with me?
225	00:23:48	00:23:51	You ever been to El Paso, Texas?
226	00:23:51	00:23:52	What are you bringing this up for?
227	00:23:52	00:23:54	Because you have a record.
228	00:23:54	00:23:55	That was the past.
229	00:23:55	00:23:57	Okay?
230	00:23:57	00:24:02	Look, it's been two years I have not committed a felony, nor a misdemeanor.
231	00:24:02	00:24:06	And now you come up to me, acting like if I'm a criminal... No, hey, hey.
232	00:24:09	00:24:11	Do you know this girl?
233	00:24:11	00:24:12	It's a college student.
234	00:24:13	00:24:14	Take a look at this. Take this.
235	00:24:14	00:24:15	She was last seen here.
236	00:24:15	00:24:17	Take this and look at it.
237	00:24:18	00:24:21	Yeah, I saw her once.
238	00:24:21	00:24:22	It was about two weeks ago.
239	00:24:22	00:24:23	Two weeks ago?
240	00:24:23	00:24:25	When I was done wrestling... Yeah?
241	00:24:25	00:24:30	...and I was stepping outside the parking lot, she came out here like a big old fan...
242	00:24:30	00:24:32	Uh-huh? ...saying she wanted an autograph.
243	00:24:32	00:24:34	And then we just... I took off.
244	00:24:34	00:24:35	You're sure that was it?
245	00:24:35	00:24:37	Look, I'm not lying to you.
246	00:24:43	00:24:49	What happened in, uh, 2004 when you were convicted of armed robbery in Arizona?
247	00:24:52	00:24:55	I was in Arizona, yes.
248	00:24:55	00:24:58	Didn't you get convicted on that?
249	00:24:58	00:25:00	It was...
250	00:25:00	00:25:05	Yes, there was a conviction, but, uh, bum rap.
251	00:25:05	00:25:07	What about the cocaine conviction in 2005 in Nevada.
252	00:25:07	00:25:10	Wrong place, wrong time.
253	00:25:10	00:25:14	We're going to give you an opportunity to make a really good decision.
254	00:25:14	00:25:16	We need a sample of your DNA.
255	00:25:16	00:25:19	We're investigating a murder of a young woman who was found about three blocks from here.
256	00:25:20	00:25:22	You have any objections to that?
257	00:25:22	00:25:26	DNA gets people in trouble if it's mishandled.
258	00:25:26	00:25:28	It also gets you out of trouble.
259	00:25:28	00:25:30	Really, I'm not too sure about that, man.
260	00:25:30	00:25:31	Hey, what have you got to lose?
261	00:25:32	00:25:33	Make a good decision.
262	00:25:33	00:25:35	I'd rather not.
263	00:25:35	00:25:37	I'd rather not.
264	00:25:37	00:25:42	I started wrestling in Mexico City because...
265	00:25:42	00:25:44	Mexico has this passion for wrestling.
266	00:25:44	00:25:52	And I grew up, you know, watching wrestling, and finding all these luchadores so extraordinary, so, uh, heroic.
267	00:25:53	00:25:56	El Santo, Mil MÃ¡scaras, Chivo Garcia, Blue Demon...
268	00:25:56	00:25:57	Those were my idols.
269	00:25:57	00:26:01	How did you end up in, uh, Albuquerque, New Mexico?
270	00:26:01	00:26:09	I think I remember about that, and it's a thing that I'd like to forget because it was a bum rap.
271	00:26:09	00:26:11	You're convicted for rape in Albuquerque.
272	00:26:11	00:26:14	You're convicted for attacking a police officer in Las Cruces, New Mexico.
273	00:26:14	00:26:15	I didn't get represented properly.
274	00:26:16	00:26:17	Okay.
275	00:26:17	00:26:19	And I served a sentence which I should not have served.
276	00:26:19	00:26:22	Hey, listen, listen. And the attorney did not do a good job.
277	00:26:22	00:26:24	Jesus, we're not here to bust you about that.
278	00:26:24	00:26:26	What's your famous move, Jesus?
279	00:26:26	00:26:35	My strong move is lava volcÃ¡n, which is the lava of the volcano, which is a headlock.
280	00:26:35	00:26:41	You hold it, put your hand here, hold the neck, and you squeeze!
281	00:26:41	00:26:44	When you wear this mask...
282	00:26:44	00:26:46	it also hides you from other people, right?
283	00:26:46	00:26:48	That's right.
284	00:26:48	00:26:54	So, Volcan... people wouldn't know who you were if you attacked them wearing this mask.
285	00:27:02	00:27:04	You know, I...
286	00:27:04	00:27:13	I have to tell you that it, uh, it felt good to have a pretty, young girl like that come, ask me questions.
287	00:27:14	00:27:15	It took me back.
288	00:27:15	00:27:17	It took me back to the old days.
289	00:27:17	00:27:19	You know, when I was a... a champion.
290	00:27:19	00:27:21	A real campeÃ³n.
291	00:27:21	00:27:24	An old luchador took me under his wing.
292	00:27:24	00:27:26	He taught me everything.
293	00:27:26	00:27:30	And then they gave me a chance, they put me in there, you know, they put me in there with an old luchador.
294	00:27:30	00:27:32	They didn't think I could do it.
295	00:27:32	00:27:33	I surprise everybody.
296	00:27:33	00:27:35	I put him down right away.
297	00:27:35	00:27:41	What was the hold you used in, uh... on your wife in Albuquerque, New Mexico, when you were arrested for assault and battery?
298	00:27:41	00:27:42	That was a misunderstanding.
299	00:27:42	00:27:44	That-That... No, no, no, no.
300	00:27:44	00:27:45	That was... That was a mistake.
301	00:27:45	00:27:47	Does the record about the assault and battery of the woman.... Yeah, it's all here.
302	00:27:48	00:27:50	...does it say in the record that she attacked me first?
303	00:27:50	00:27:54	Huh? Does it say there that she cut up my face with a-with a broken bottle?
304	00:27:54	00:27:57	Huh? Does it say that the charges were dropped?
305	00:27:57	00:28:00	They were, huh? So you got lucky.
306	00:28:00	00:28:02	Well, that's... Huh?
307	00:28:02	00:28:04	That's history now.
308	00:28:04	00:28:06	She's married to another man anyway. It's, uh...
309	00:28:06	00:28:09	Yeah, aren't they all? Aren't they all?
310	00:28:09	00:28:11	You like to beat up women?
311	00:28:11	00:28:13	No. I like women.
312	00:28:13	00:28:14	Women like me.
313	00:28:14	00:28:15	How about this woman?
314	00:28:15	00:28:19	You ever see her before? Is this the one you were talking about earlier?
315	00:28:20	00:28:21	Well...
316	00:28:21	00:28:24	Yes, I, uh, I-I...
317	00:28:24	00:28:27	Why? Why are you asking me about her?
318	00:28:27	00:28:28	Just look at her.
319	00:28:28	00:28:31	You know, I...
320	00:28:31	00:28:33	Oh, I remember now.
321	00:28:33	00:28:36	Yeah, she was... she was coming around, talking to the luchadores.
322	00:28:37	00:28:38	What did she want?
323	00:28:40	00:28:42	About the lucha libre.
324	00:28:42	00:28:44	She was a fan. That's what she said.
325	00:28:44	00:28:46	She said she was investigating. She said she wanted to...
326	00:28:46	00:28:48	She was investigating what?
327	00:28:48	00:28:51	She was, uh... writing some kind of... a paper.
328	00:28:51	00:28:52	She was going to do a...
329	00:28:53	00:28:55	write a story about lucha libre, you know?
330	00:28:55	00:28:56	That's it?
331	00:28:56	00:28:58	Yeah. She was talking to the luchadores.
332	00:28:58	00:28:59	And, uh, she was hanging around.
333	00:28:59	00:29:01	That's all.
334	00:29:01	00:29:02	She ever mention any other names to you?
335	00:29:02	00:29:05	Names of-of what? Luchadores?
336	00:29:05	00:29:07	Women. Women?
337	00:29:07	00:29:08	Attractive women.
338	00:29:08	00:29:11	Why would she be mentioning attractive women to me?
339	00:29:12	00:29:14	A, uh, Jessica Martinez?
340	00:29:14	00:29:17	Who? Jessica Martinez.
341	00:29:17	00:29:20	Uh, no. That's a very common name.
342	00:29:20	00:29:22	No? No.
343	00:29:22	00:29:23	Uh, Elena Garcia?
344	00:29:23	00:29:26	Elena Garcia? No, I don't know any Elena Garcia.
345	00:29:26	00:29:29	What about, um, Maria Perez?
346	00:29:29	00:29:30	Maria Perez? Think about it. Think about it.
347	00:29:30	00:29:32	What is it? What is it? Just don't lie to me.
348	00:29:32	00:29:33	What? Just think about it. Think about it.
349	00:29:33	00:29:34	I'm not lying.
350	00:29:34	00:29:38	So, you won't mind giving us a sample of your DNA, then.
351	00:29:38	00:29:43	Too many innocent people have been sent to jail because of DNA.
352	00:29:43	00:29:46	You guys, you think that the DNA is everything now, huh?
353	00:29:46	00:29:47	Everything is DNA. DNA. No. No.
354	00:29:47	00:29:49	Hey, it helps a lot of people get out of jail, too.
355	00:29:50	00:29:55	Look. It's a very easy thing, the procedure, we just swab a little cotton stick in your mouth, get some DNA.
356	00:29:55	00:29:57	We find out a little bit more about you.
357	00:29:57	00:29:58	That's very good. What's behind the mask?
358	00:29:58	00:29:59	Okay. That's very good.
359	00:30:00	00:30:01	It won't take long.
360	00:30:01	00:30:06	You know, the last time... the last time a cop said that to me, I did two weeks in County.
361	00:30:07	00:30:13	Any of these wrestlers had the strength and the skill to induce spinal shock, and...
362	00:30:13	00:30:18	I think that that leather fragment we found in Sylvia's hand came from a luchador's mask.
363	00:30:18	00:30:21	Well, if it did, it was probably very old.
364	00:30:21	00:30:26	The fragment was tanned with oak, which is a process that fell out of use in Mexico in the late '70s.
365	00:30:26	00:30:29	Here, take a look at this detail.
366	00:30:29	00:30:33	That piece of leather appears to be at least 50 years old.
367	00:31:49	00:31:51	Yes.
368	00:31:51	00:31:53	I guess you could say I was born into it.
369	00:31:53	00:31:54	See, my dad was a wrestler.
370	00:31:54	00:31:56	He gave me his original 50-year-old mask.
371	00:31:56	00:31:58	This one's just a copy.
372	00:31:58	00:32:01	I got 20 of these. You want me to get one for you? I'll autograph one for you, man.
373	00:32:01	00:32:15	I love lucha libre, man. I love the, uh, the utter chaos when the... the bad guys are beating up the good guys, and the crowd's throwing chicken bones and beer bottles in the ring, then the good guys come back at the end.
374	00:32:15	00:32:20	It's like, uh, in my sick head, it's like romantic poetry, man, you know?
375	00:32:20	00:32:22	What happened last year in Phoenix?
376	00:32:22	00:32:27	Couple, uh-- We were at a bar, couple guys started mouthing off about how fake wrestling is.
377	00:32:27	00:32:29	So all right, Let's go in the parking lot, man.
378	00:32:29	00:32:31	We'll see how fake it is.
379	00:32:31	00:32:35	Things got out of control, the wrestlers, the wrestlers won that night.
380	00:32:35	00:32:37	But I-I beat the charge, you know.
381	00:32:37	00:32:38	It was attempted murder.
382	00:32:38	00:32:41	I mean, I'd call that getting way out of control.
383	00:32:41	00:32:44	Yeah, it was attempted murder, but like I said, there's no record.
384	00:32:44	00:32:45	And what move are you known for?
385	00:32:46	00:32:47	Ah, the finishing move for Fantasmo.
386	00:32:47	00:32:48	Ah, man, you'd love it.
387	00:32:48	00:32:50	It's called the Fantasmo Face-lift.
388	00:32:50	00:32:52	Check it out.
389	00:32:52	00:32:57	I get my right arm, right, underneath the chin, then I get my left arm right behind the neck. Okay?
390	00:32:57	00:32:58	Then I push down.
391	00:32:58	00:33:04	If I use enough force-- see, I cut off the air supply-- if I use enough force-- mm!-- up with the face.
392	00:33:06	00:33:10	Jesus, would you mind giving us a sample of your DNA?
393	00:33:10	00:33:12	No.
394	00:33:12	00:33:13	I didn't do nothing wrong.
395	00:33:13	00:33:15	Do what you got to do, man.
396	00:33:15	00:33:20	The unknown DNA sample on the leather fragment was a mixture, but that fragment was from Fantasmo's mask.
397	00:33:20	00:33:25	So what I did was subtract Fantasmo's DNA, I reran the whole profile, and I got a hit.
398	00:33:32	00:33:33	He was actually in the arrestee index.
399	00:33:33	00:33:37	It was for a domestic violence rap in New Mexico 12 years ago.
400	00:33:37	00:33:38	Well, he's not one of the wrestlers.
401	00:33:39	00:33:41	He's the emcee.
402	00:33:55	00:33:59	Couldn't this wait till after the show?
403	00:33:59	00:34:01	I got a really full house to rev up for tonight.
404	00:34:01	00:34:05	What are you doing with my mask?
405	00:34:05	00:34:07	What are you talking about?
406	00:34:07	00:34:11	This mask has been missing ever since that girl got killed.
407	00:34:13	00:34:16	And now I find it in your bag.
408	00:34:16	00:34:18	What are you saying?
409	00:34:18	00:34:20	You think I had something to do with that?
410	00:34:20	00:34:29	I seen you with that girl so many times, staring at her all weird, the same way you used to stare at them chicas down in Albuquerque...
411	00:34:29	00:34:31	in LA.
412	00:34:31	00:34:34	You don't know what you're saying.
413	00:34:34	00:34:36	I had nothing to do with that.
414	00:34:36	00:34:38	You brought the heat down on every one of us.
415	00:34:38	00:34:42	The cops already think we're a bunch of bangers and scumbags as it is.
416	00:34:42	00:34:44	And now murderers, too?!
417	00:34:44	00:34:45	'Varo, please.
418	00:34:45	00:34:47	You got to believe me.
419	00:34:47	00:34:49	Get the hell out of my locker room.
420	00:34:49	00:34:51	I swear to you...
421	00:34:52	00:34:55	Te lo juro por mi madre.
422	00:34:55	00:34:57	I didn't do it.
423	00:34:57	00:35:00	Go, now!
424	00:35:00	00:35:02	You don't belong here anymore.
425	00:36:11	00:36:13	What?
426	00:37:25	00:37:26	Don't do anything weird.
427	00:37:38	00:37:40	Boo!
428	00:37:47	00:37:49	Yeah! Punch him!
429	00:38:02	00:38:04	Hey!
430	00:38:04	00:38:06	Hey, good!
431	00:38:17	00:38:20	Get your hands in the air!
432	00:38:21	00:38:22	Get them up!
433	00:38:22	00:38:23	You're all done.
434	00:38:23	00:38:26	Get down on your knees.
435	00:38:28	00:38:29	Get down!
436	00:38:34	00:38:37	I didn't do it.
437	00:38:37	00:38:38	I'm innocent.
438	00:38:38	00:38:40	I know what the parents are going through.
439	00:38:40	00:38:44	I... I wanted to help you guys.
440	00:38:44	00:38:48	When you killed Sylvia Mallick, you were wearing a mask.
441	00:38:48	00:38:50	We have your DNA on a piece of that mask.
442	00:38:50	00:38:52	That's called incriminating evidence.
443	00:38:53	00:38:54	I-I didn't hurt anybody.
444	00:38:54	00:38:56	You never hurt anybody?
445	00:38:56	00:38:58	Yeah.
446	00:38:58	00:38:59	I don't know who that is.
447	00:38:59	00:39:00	What about Elena Garcia?
448	00:39:01	00:39:02	I-I don't...
449	00:39:02	00:39:03	What about Maria Perez?
450	00:39:03	00:39:04	I-I didn't hurt them.
451	00:39:04	00:39:05	You didn't hurt these women?
452	00:39:05	00:39:06	No. I don't know who...
453	00:39:07	00:39:08	You didn't murder these women?
454	00:39:08	00:39:09	No, I did not do this.
455	00:39:09	00:39:11	You didn't murder Sylvia Mallick?
456	00:39:11	00:39:12	No, I didn't. No!
457	00:39:12	00:39:14	Then who did?
458	00:39:15	00:39:18	Who did?
459	00:39:18	00:39:21	It was Oggun.
460	00:39:23	00:39:25	Oggun did it.
461	00:39:25	00:39:33	Oggun is the god of violence and brute force.
462	00:39:35	00:39:37	Oggun.
463	00:39:37	00:39:40	I tried to stop him.
464	00:39:40	00:39:42	I tried to reason with him.
465	00:39:42	00:39:46	But Oggun would not listen.
466	00:39:47	00:39:51	I begged him not to hurt anyone else.
467	00:39:53	00:39:57	I went to the priest.
468	00:39:57	00:40:01	But the priest couldn't stop Oggun.
469	00:40:01	00:40:04	Oggun is the knife.
470	00:40:06	00:40:07	Oggun needs sacrifice.
471	00:40:07	00:40:12	Oggun didn't murder Sylvia Mallick, you did.
472	00:40:12	00:40:13	Ray... (screams)
473	00:40:13	00:40:16	No evil spirit murdered this woman. We gotta...
474	00:40:16	00:40:21	You did, because she was going to reveal you as the murderer you are! Hey, hey, hey, Ray. Ray.
475	00:40:21	00:40:23	Take it easy, take it... Ray, take it easy.
476	00:40:29	00:40:31	Ray!
477	00:40:47	00:40:49	So you're gonna be a CSI?
478	00:40:49	00:40:51	I am.
479	00:40:51	00:40:53	You'll be great at it.
480	00:40:54	00:40:56	And so will you one day.
481	00:40:56	00:40:58	I think so.
482	00:41:01	00:41:04	Well, I'm gonna hold you to your promise.
483	00:41:04	00:41:06	You better take my call.
484	00:41:06	00:41:08	You can count on it.
485	00:41:56	00:42:00	I had a student who wanted to be published.
486	00:42:00	00:42:02	These would've been her words.
487	00:42:02	00:42:11	I dedicate each chapter to the unsolved cold cases LVPD has deemed related by evidence or method of killing.
488	00:42:12	00:42:27	Hopefully, by the time I'm done, we will have a better idea why these serial killers got away I intend to write in detail about the ones who did not.
