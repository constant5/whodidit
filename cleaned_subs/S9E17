0	00:00:41	00:00:42	Drop your weapon.
1	00:01:34	00:01:35	Drop your gun!
2	00:01:36	00:01:38	Drop your gun now.
3	00:01:39	00:01:40	You can't win; it's four on one.
4	00:01:40	00:01:42	Then I guess it's just about how many of you I take with me.
5	00:01:42	00:01:45	It's okay, Riley. We got you covered.
6	00:01:49	00:01:50	You're dead.
7	00:01:52	00:01:53	Nice shot, Willows. (blows)
8	00:01:53	00:01:54	Thanks.
9	00:01:54	00:01:59	And, Adams, you get points for calling Sanders by your name to communicate your intentions.
10	00:01:59	00:02:00	That's a good job.
11	00:02:00	00:02:02	Hey, how many points does she lose for missing?
12	00:02:02	00:02:07	I don't want to be defensive or anything, but the only reason I missed was because Greg couldn't get out of the hold.
13	00:02:07	00:02:08	Oh, please.
14	00:02:08	00:02:10	Lee knows the signals better than we do.
15	00:02:10	00:02:13	And besides, you could've been more subtle.
16	00:02:13	00:02:18	I need sidearm clearance and I've got to take a look at the tactical manual again.
17	00:02:18	00:02:21	These codes are very, very confusing.
18	00:02:21	00:02:23	Uh, the most important signal is Code Four.
19	00:02:23	00:02:26	Situation's secure-- Code Four.
20	00:02:26	00:02:28	Second most important four eighty-two.
21	00:02:28	00:02:30	I know this. 482 is...
22	00:02:31	00:02:33	What is it?
23	00:02:33	00:02:34	Lunch. Okay.
24	00:02:34	00:02:36	And Riley's buying.
25	00:02:36	00:02:37	(cell phone ringing) Nice.
26	00:02:37	00:02:39	I'm buying? Yeah.
27	00:02:39	00:02:40	Well, then I hope you all like value meals.
28	00:02:40	00:02:43	This is Catherine.
29	00:02:44	00:02:45	Oh.
30	00:02:47	00:02:50	Uh, uh, ten minutes out.
31	00:02:50	00:02:52	Copy that.
32	00:02:54	00:02:56	Multiple 419s at Green Valley and Elm.
33	00:02:56	00:02:57	All hands on deck.
34	00:03:07	00:03:11	I looked at a house around the corner from here when I first moved to town.
35	00:03:12	00:03:13	I thought this was a nice neighborhood.
36	00:03:13	00:03:15	It is.
37	00:03:15	00:03:20	I heard this big crash, so I ran outside, and I saw three, maybe four guys fighting with Reggie Hatcher.
38	00:03:20	00:03:22	Bill came out running with his gun.
39	00:03:22	00:03:24	He tried to stop the fight, and they shot him.
40	00:03:24	00:03:26	It was like Halo 3; everybody started shooting.
41	00:03:26	00:03:28	Next thing you know, I go down.
42	00:03:28	00:03:29	Okay, here's what we got.
43	00:03:29	00:03:35	A call came into 911 00 p.m.-- shots fired.
44	00:03:35	00:03:38	Neighborhood Watch captain was shot dead in the street.
45	00:03:38	00:03:44	A seven-year-old boy was shot and killed by a stray bullet when he came out to see what was going on.
46	00:03:47	00:03:51	All this happened in front of the Hatcher house.
47	00:03:51	00:03:52	Any suspect info?
48	00:03:52	00:04:00	Well, it's early, but what we know so far is it could be between two, three or four suspects, black, Hispanic or white.
49	00:04:00	00:04:03	They were driving an SUV that's either black, navy blue or dark green.
50	00:04:03	00:04:04	Okay?
51	00:04:04	00:04:06	I know that doesn't give us much to work with.
52	00:04:06	00:04:08	There's plenty for us to work with here.
53	00:04:44	00:04:49	According to witnesses, the suspects' car was parked here in front of this house, facing the wrong way.
54	00:04:49	00:04:52	The suspects then proceeded on foot to the Hatcher house.
55	00:04:55	00:05:10	The owner, Priscilla Hatcher-- she was transported to the hospital with a head injury, so the interview was limited-- but she told me that a group of men-- uh, she wasn't specific about how many-- broke in, they roughed her up, they roughed up her son Reggie and her nephew Frankie.
56	00:05:10	00:05:12	So what do the son and the nephew have to say?
57	00:05:12	00:05:13	Well, they're in the wind.
58	00:05:13	00:05:14	We're looking for them.
59	00:05:14	00:05:16	So they could've been abducted.
60	00:05:17	00:05:18	Something bigger than a bullet came through this window.
61	00:05:18	00:05:22	You've got bloody glass, blood drops.
62	00:05:22	00:05:23	Fight looks like it came out this way.
63	00:05:23	00:05:26	Well, that confirms what Priscilla Hatcher said.
64	00:05:26	00:05:31	She said that her son Reggie got into a scuffle with one of the intruders, and they came through the window.
65	00:05:32	00:05:35	The Hatchers were the targets, yet suspects didn't park out front.
66	00:05:35	00:05:39	Maybe the suspects didn't want the vehicle to be seen.
67	00:05:39	00:05:42	Or didn't know which house they were going to hit.
68	00:05:42	00:05:44	Why don't you guys take the house.
69	00:05:44	00:05:46	All right.
70	00:05:48	00:05:50	The Neighborhood Watch captain.
71	00:05:50	00:05:53	His name is Bill French.
72	00:05:53	00:05:54	He's a veteran.
73	00:05:54	00:05:58	Survived a tour in Iraq only to get gunned down in front of his own house.
74	00:05:58	00:05:59	It's a shame, really.
75	00:05:59	00:06:01	We have a gun here.
76	00:06:01	00:06:03	He got off two rounds.
77	00:06:03	00:06:05	.38 caliber.
78	00:06:05	00:06:08	Nine millimeter.
79	00:06:09	00:06:11	Shells all over the place.
80	00:06:11	00:06:13	Most of the recent gang shootings were with nines.
81	00:06:15	00:06:20	A blood pool and a blood trail away from the body.
82	00:06:20	00:06:21	Got to be from a second source.
83	00:06:21	00:06:25	Maybe the Watch commander shot one of the bad guys.
84	00:06:25	00:06:26	You got this, Riley?
85	00:06:26	00:06:28	Yeah.
86	00:06:28	00:06:29	Sir, I know this is hard.
87	00:06:29	00:06:30	I am just doing my job.
88	00:06:30	00:06:32	No. Just leave us alone.
89	00:06:32	00:06:33	Sir, please... Listen, you can't take him.
90	00:06:33	00:06:35	I'll drive him to the hospital, okay?
91	00:06:35	00:06:36	I'll drive him.
92	00:06:36	00:06:38	Sir, please.
93	00:06:38	00:06:39	I need to take him.
94	00:06:39	00:06:41	You don't even know his name.
95	00:06:41	00:06:43	Okay, but... Excuse me.
96	00:06:43	00:06:44	I'm Greg Sanders.
97	00:06:44	00:06:45	I'm with the crime lab.
98	00:06:47	00:06:49	What is your son's name?
99	00:06:53	00:06:55	Jason Morley.
100	00:06:55	00:06:56	All right, Mr. Morley.
101	00:06:57	00:07:01	Jason's no longer with us.
102	00:07:01	00:07:03	He's in a better place.
103	00:07:03	00:07:07	There's nothing any of us can do to change that.
104	00:07:08	00:07:13	But you have to let us take him, so we can figure out who did this.
105	00:07:20	00:07:23	David here will take very good care of your son.
106	00:07:23	00:07:24	I promise.
107	00:07:25	00:07:27	Sir, please.
108	00:07:32	00:07:34	Okay. Okay.
109	00:07:34	00:07:35	Okay.
110	00:07:46	00:07:49	Fresh collision damage.
111	00:07:49	00:07:51	Broken car lights.
112	00:07:51	00:07:52	Paint transfer.
113	00:07:52	00:07:54	Got to be from our suspects' vehicle.
114	00:07:54	00:07:55	That's what I'm thinking.
115	00:07:55	00:08:00	Suspects' car is parked on the west side of the cul-de-sac, facing north.
116	00:08:00	00:08:01	Right.
117	00:08:01	00:08:04	If that blood does belong to one of the suspects...
118	00:08:04	00:08:05	Mm-hmm?
119	00:08:05	00:08:10	...I'd say he got into his car, peels out, leaving behind these yaw marks...
120	00:08:13	00:08:15	Go, go!
121	00:08:15	00:08:17	...sideswipes the two parked cars?
122	00:08:17	00:08:19	Yeah, that's about it.
123	00:08:19	00:08:20	Riley.
124	00:08:20	00:08:23	Make sure that you process the collision damage on the two cars.
125	00:08:23	00:08:25	You got it, boss.
126	00:08:25	00:08:26	Thank you.
127	00:09:09	00:09:13	This must be Reggie and his cousin Frankie.
128	00:09:14	00:09:18	Reggie was valedictorian of his high school class.
129	00:09:18	00:09:20	Smart kid.
130	00:09:20	00:09:23	Hope he has some street smarts, too.
131	00:09:23	00:09:26	I'll go take a look around the rest of the house.
132	00:09:26	00:09:28	Okay.
133	00:09:45	00:09:46	What do we have?
134	00:09:46	00:09:48	I got a pretty good handprint off the TV here.
135	00:09:48	00:09:52	We have two bedrooms-- Mom's and Frankie's.
136	00:09:52	00:09:57	Found a rolled up sleeping bag and Reggie's backpack on the floor in Frankie's room.
137	00:09:57	00:09:59	He's a student at WLVU.
138	00:10:00	00:10:02	I don't think he lives here though.
139	00:10:02	00:10:05	Maybe he comes home to do his laundry.
140	00:10:09	00:10:11	According to this...
141	00:10:13	00:10:15	...he lives right down the street.
142	00:10:26	00:10:27	It's all clear.
143	00:10:27	00:10:28	Nobody home.
144	00:10:28	00:10:32	This is the house the SUV was parked in front of.
145	00:10:32	00:10:34	Yeah. Brass.
146	00:10:34	00:10:37	Okay, I'm going to want to talk to him.
147	00:10:37	00:10:38	I'll be right there.
148	00:10:38	00:10:42	So a shooting victim just rolled in to Desert Palm Hospital.
149	00:10:42	00:10:43	Could be one of our suspects.
150	00:10:43	00:10:46	I'm gonna go. Are you okay? I'm fine.
151	00:10:50	00:10:52	When can we talk to him?
152	00:10:52	00:10:53	Well, he's in rough shape.
153	00:10:53	00:10:54	The docs are working on him.
154	00:10:54	00:10:56	The bullet hit an artery.
155	00:10:56	00:10:58	He's lost a lot of blood. I don't know... Hey, Doc.
156	00:10:58	00:10:59	He's dead, I'm afraid.
157	00:11:00	00:11:01	We found a gun on him.
158	00:11:01	00:11:06	It's in there with his clothes and a bullet that I pulled out of his leg.
159	00:11:06	00:11:08	Thank you. Sure.
160	00:11:14	00:11:16	Nine millimeter.
161	00:11:17	00:11:22	Cuts on his face-- maybe he went through the window with Reggie.
162	00:11:22	00:11:23	Snakeback tattoos.
163	00:11:24	00:11:25	Guy's a gangbanger.
164	00:11:32	00:11:35	Marcus Garfield.
165	00:11:35	00:11:42	Five arrests for drugs and various armed assaults. Well, the Snakeback gang's primary source of revenue is drugs.
166	00:11:42	00:11:44	But that street-- it's not in their territory.
167	00:11:44	00:11:49	Well, Reggie Hatcher was a student at WLVU, which is in their territory.
168	00:11:49	00:11:51	Maybe Reggie knew them.
169	00:11:51	00:11:53	That would make Reggie the target, not the house.
170	00:11:53	00:11:57	Then Reggie and Frankie are probably dead.
171	00:12:08	00:12:09	Let me drive.
172	00:12:09	00:12:11	Just give me a second here.
173	00:12:11	00:12:14	I'm trying to do Archie a favor, not get him fired.
174	00:12:14	00:12:16	He's at the Academy meeting.
175	00:12:16	00:12:17	In Denver.
176	00:12:17	00:12:19	Which means he's snowboarding.
177	00:12:19	00:12:21	There is more to life than work.
178	00:12:21	00:12:24	That's a lesson I learned from your predecessor.
179	00:12:29	00:12:31	Where did it go?
180	00:12:34	00:12:36	Hmm.
181	00:12:38	00:12:40	Camera angle's too high.
182	00:12:40	00:12:42	I can't isolate the driver's face.
183	00:12:42	00:12:44	Good. I thought I missed something.
184	00:12:44	00:12:49	With these tinted windows, you can't tell if anyone else is in the back.
185	00:12:49	00:12:53	But I did get you the license number.
186	00:12:53	00:13:00	And, uh, just for the record, Archie may be riding a half-pipe, but it's only in between lectures.
187	00:13:00	00:13:04	Such as, uh, Breath Analysis as a Forensics Tool.
188	00:13:04	00:13:06	That one's for me.
189	00:13:06	00:13:07	It's a part of our deal.
190	00:13:07	00:13:09	He got funded and I didn't.
191	00:13:12	00:13:15	R.O. is Marcus Garfield.
192	00:13:15	00:13:18	So I got you the driver.
193	00:13:18	00:13:22	No. He may have driven to the crime scene, but he didn't drive to the hospital.
194	00:13:22	00:13:24	He's the one that got rolled out.
195	00:13:24	00:13:29	Hey, ran the bullets and the shell casings.
196	00:13:29	00:13:30	All nine mill.
197	00:13:31	00:13:34	14 from the dead suspect's gun, 13 from some other nine.
198	00:13:34	00:13:36	27 in total.
199	00:13:36	00:13:38	So they were packing high-capacity semiautos.
200	00:13:38	00:13:42	Nick and Langston didn't recover any ammo evidence from the Hatcher house.
201	00:13:42	00:13:45	If they went there to kill Reggie, they would have shot him inside.
202	00:13:45	00:13:48	If they didn't want to kill him, what did they want?
203	00:13:52	00:13:54	Jim, what's up?
204	00:13:56	00:13:57	Copy that.
205	00:13:57	00:13:59	On my way.
206	00:14:00	00:14:04	Brass may have just found both Reggie and Frankie.
207	00:14:08	00:14:10	Jim.
208	00:14:10	00:14:12	Oh, decomp.
209	00:14:12	00:14:15	The mall security smelled it, too.
210	00:14:15	00:14:18	When she was writing up the third parking violation.
211	00:14:18	00:14:21	The car's registered to Aaron Sweets.
212	00:14:21	00:14:22	He ran with the Snakebacks.
213	00:14:22	00:14:25	And according to his record, he knew Marcus Garfield.
214	00:14:25	00:14:27	James, come on in and open this up.
215	00:14:27	00:14:30	We're only about six or eight blocks from the crime scene.
216	00:14:36	00:14:39	Well, that's not Reggie or Frankie.
217	00:14:43	00:14:45	Who's buried in Grant's tomb?
218	00:14:46	00:14:47	Sweets.
219	00:14:47	00:14:49	You see the candy cane?
220	00:14:49	00:14:51	Aaron Sweets.
221	00:14:53	00:14:56	Well, first ticket was written day before yesterday.
222	00:14:56	00:15:00	Well, that means Aaron Sweets is not our missing suspect.
223	00:15:38	00:15:40	That makes four.
224	00:15:40	00:15:41	All .22s.
225	00:15:41	00:15:44	None of the players in our mess had .22s.
226	00:15:44	00:15:46	TOD?
227	00:15:46	00:15:50	Mr. Sweets here had assumed room temperature.
228	00:15:50	00:15:51	Been dead 24 to 48 hours.
229	00:15:51	00:15:53	So he was dead before the shoot-out?
230	00:15:53	00:15:55	Mm-hmm.
231	00:15:55	00:15:57	I get gangbangers in here all the time.
232	00:15:57	00:15:58	Might be unrelated.
233	00:15:59	00:16:02	Scenes were six blocks apart in a nice neighborhood.
234	00:16:02	00:16:04	This isn't just a coincidence.
235	00:16:04	00:16:10	Marcus Garfield and an unknown suspect gained access to the Hatcher house there.
236	00:16:12	00:16:14	He's not unknown anymore.
237	00:16:14	00:16:20	I ID'd the handprint on the TV-- Robert Danward, aka Little Bobby.
238	00:16:20	00:16:21	Another member of the Snakebacks.
239	00:16:21	00:16:27	All right. We compared the blood on the glass to the DNA on the toothbrush found in Reggie's backpack.
240	00:16:27	00:16:32	Confirmed that Marcus Garfield and Reggie crashed through the window together.
241	00:16:32	00:16:33	The fight continued into the street.
242	00:16:34	00:16:38	According to the witnesses, the Neighborhood Watch captain confronted the suspects.
243	00:16:38	00:16:44	The bullet pulled from Garfield's leg matches the Watch captain's .38.
244	00:16:44	00:16:49	The bullets they pulled from the Watch captain came from Garfield's nine.
245	00:16:56	00:17:01	One of Garfield's stray bullets hit Jason Morley who lived here.
246	00:17:01	00:17:04	He was the seven-year-old boy.
247	00:17:04	00:17:08	Aaron Sweets, another Snakeback, was shot four times with a .22.
248	00:17:08	00:17:12	His body was found in the trunk of his car in a parking garage six blocks from the crime scene.
249	00:17:12	00:17:15	There was no .22 ammo at the scene.
250	00:17:15	00:17:20	Can we find any connection between Sweets and Reggie?
251	00:17:20	00:17:25	Brass checked with WLVU. Um, Reggie's a straight-A student.
252	00:17:25	00:17:28	He was accepted early admissions for graduate school next fall.
253	00:17:28	00:17:30	And I checked Reggie's cell phone and land line records.
254	00:17:30	00:17:33	No calls to or from our suspects.
255	00:17:33	00:17:34	What about Sweets?
256	00:17:35	00:17:36	Didn't have his number.
257	00:17:36	00:17:39	Try 555-0121.
258	00:17:47	00:17:53	Sweets called Reggie's land line six times in the last four days.
259	00:17:53	00:17:55	Well, that's our connection.
260	00:17:55	00:17:57	Has anyone checked Reggie's house?
261	00:17:57	00:18:00	The uniforms cleared it, but they were only looking for bodies.
262	00:18:08	00:18:09	I tore the kitchen apart.
263	00:18:09	00:18:10	No drugs, no weapons.
264	00:18:12	00:18:15	This doesn't really look like a college kid's place.
265	00:18:15	00:18:18	Reggie inherited this house from his grandmother.
266	00:18:18	00:18:23	Lots of sculpture, paintings.
267	00:18:23	00:18:28	Lots of phone jacks in Grandma's house, but no phones.
268	00:18:28	00:18:31	Did you see a phone in the kitchen?
269	00:18:31	00:18:36	No, and none in the master or guest bedroom either.
270	00:18:36	00:18:38	Let's try Reggie's home phone number.
271	00:18:38	00:18:40	Yeah.
272	00:19:10	00:19:12	Who puts a phone in the closet?
273	00:19:26	00:19:29	Wait, wait, wait. Let me go first.
274	00:19:29	00:19:33	When you start carrying a gun, you can lead next time.
275	00:20:18	00:20:20	Odd place for a phone.
276	00:20:20	00:20:21	Yeah.
277	00:20:40	00:20:45	Piperidine, ether, cyanide.
278	00:20:45	00:20:49	Hydrochloric acid, magnesium turnings.
279	00:20:49	00:20:50	This is a PCP lab.
280	00:20:50	00:20:51	This is all highly explosive.
281	00:20:52	00:20:53	We should get out of here.
282	00:20:53	00:20:54	Yeah.
283	00:20:57	00:21:04	Word on the street is a college kid with talent as a mixer is pushing sherms in the Snakeback turf without paying them tribute.
284	00:21:04	00:21:08	Okay, so Reggie's got a target on his back because he's operating under a different business model?
285	00:21:08	00:21:11	You can get a degree, but it doesn't make you smart.
286	00:21:11	00:21:12	Any word on Little Bobby?
287	00:21:13	00:21:15	I heard he's taking some vacation time.
288	00:21:17	00:21:19	What do you want?
289	00:21:19	00:21:24	Hey, I just wanted to let you know we got the the guy who shot Jason.
290	00:21:24	00:21:27	He's a known gang member.
291	00:21:27	00:21:30	I'd like to rip his heart out.
292	00:21:30	00:21:34	I'd like to let you...
293	00:21:34	00:21:36	but he's already dead.
294	00:21:39	00:21:43	I know it probably doesn't help.
295	00:21:43	00:21:46	You have to do this very often?
296	00:21:50	00:21:52	It's not part of my job.
297	00:21:54	00:21:57	Thank you.
298	00:21:57	00:21:59	I lost my wife last year.
299	00:22:01	00:22:02	Jason...
300	00:22:02	00:22:05	just started sleeping in his own bed again.
301	00:22:09	00:22:13	Cops like coffee, right?
302	00:22:13	00:22:14	You want a cup?
303	00:22:14	00:22:17	Sure.
304	00:22:23	00:22:26	Send these up to Catherine.
305	00:22:28	00:22:31	She says Hazmat wants to know exactly what's down here.
306	00:22:34	00:22:38	Pure white powder.
307	00:22:38	00:22:40	Clear crystal finished product.
308	00:22:40	00:22:44	Usually this stuff looks like yellow sludge.
309	00:22:44	00:22:47	Reggie had it going on. It's high grade.
310	00:23:03	00:23:05	Riley.
311	00:23:11	00:23:14	Blood. Still wet.
312	00:23:17	00:23:18	Stop right there!
313	00:23:22	00:23:23	Don't move!
314	00:23:38	00:23:40	Hey, I'm just gonna go check on my guys.
315	00:23:40	00:23:42	If you need anything, let me know.
316	00:23:42	00:23:43	All right.
317	00:23:43	00:23:45	Drop your guns!
318	00:23:45	00:23:46	We're not cops.
319	00:23:46	00:23:48	We're lab techs. We don't carry guns.
320	00:23:52	00:23:53	Over there! Sit down!
321	00:23:55	00:23:59	Just put the gun down, okay?
322	00:23:59	00:24:01	We'll do whatever you want.
323	00:24:04	00:24:05	There's a lot of chemicals in here.
324	00:24:05	00:24:07	If you shoot, you're gonna blow us all up.
325	00:24:07	00:24:09	Sit down! Shut up!
326	00:24:11	00:24:13	Go!
327	00:24:13	00:24:15	And shut up!
328	00:24:16	00:24:17	What happened to your friend?
329	00:24:17	00:24:19	I said shut up!
330	00:24:19	00:24:21	Knock, knock? Anybody home?
331	00:24:21	00:24:23	Who the hell is that? A cop?
332	00:24:23	00:24:27	No. He works with us.
333	00:24:27	00:24:29	I'm gonna get rid of him, okay?
334	00:24:34	00:24:37	You don't need any more problems.
335	00:24:39	00:24:41	Hello?
336	00:24:44	00:24:46	Hey, guys.
337	00:24:47	00:24:48	Get over here.
338	00:24:52	00:24:54	Hey, you down there?
339	00:24:54	00:24:56	I was in the neighborhood, thought I'd stop by, see if you need any... It's okay.
340	00:24:56	00:24:58	Riley...
341	00:24:58	00:25:00	we don't need any help.
342	00:25:00	00:25:03	Okay, Sanders.
343	00:25:05	00:25:07	See you back at the lab.
344	00:25:17	00:25:19	Here, sit, sit!
345	00:25:31	00:25:35	We have a situation downstairs.
346	00:25:35	00:25:36	Suspects on the premises.
347	00:25:36	00:25:40	There's a surveillance camera over the front door.
348	00:25:40	00:25:42	I'm going to go call it in.
349	00:26:04	00:26:06	Hey, Greg.
350	00:26:07	00:26:12	Langston and Riley have been taken hostage at the PCP lab.
351	00:26:12	00:26:15	I don't know who or how many.
352	00:26:15	00:26:17	I'll call SWAT, notify Catherine.
353	00:26:24	00:26:27	You're Reggie, right?
354	00:26:27	00:26:30	Hey, man, you listen, okay?
355	00:26:30	00:26:31	I'm not gonna tell you again, okay?
356	00:26:31	00:26:33	Just sit there and shut up.
357	00:26:33	00:26:35	All right, Frankie, try to calm down.
358	00:26:35	00:26:39	How do you know who I am?
359	00:26:39	00:26:41	Reggie, your mother's in the hospital.
360	00:26:41	00:26:42	She's worried about you.
361	00:26:44	00:26:45	She's worried about the both of you.
362	00:26:50	00:26:52	Reggie looks like he's hurt pretty bad, Frankie.
363	00:26:52	00:26:53	I can help him. I'm a doctor.
364	00:26:56	00:26:58	I can help him.
365	00:26:58	00:27:00	All I need to do is look at him.
366	00:27:02	00:27:03	Go.
367	00:27:05	00:27:07	No, no, no, you sit.
368	00:27:16	00:27:18	I need more light to examine him properly.
369	00:27:19	00:27:20	Can we bring him into the lab?
370	00:27:22	00:27:23	Yeah, okay, okay, okay.
371	00:27:23	00:27:25	But this better not be a trick!
372	00:27:26	00:27:27	We'll lay you down on three.
373	00:27:27	00:27:31	One, two... three.
374	00:27:32	00:27:34	You hanging in there?
375	00:27:34	00:27:36	Is my mom okay?
376	00:27:36	00:27:39	I think she's going to be fine.
377	00:27:40	00:27:44	I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
378	00:27:44	00:27:46	Well, no one ever does.
379	00:27:46	00:27:49	Am I... am I gonna die?
380	00:27:49	00:27:52	If you tried to take this glass out yourself, you probably would have.
381	00:27:52	00:27:55	You know, I was...
382	00:27:55	00:27:57	I was a big fan of Steve Irwin.
383	00:27:57	00:28:00	Me, too.
384	00:28:05	00:28:07	Hey, come on, man, there's nothing wrong with his head.
385	00:28:07	00:28:08	Get your finger off of there.
386	00:28:09	00:28:12	I need to check his vitals; his heart rate.
387	00:28:12	00:28:15	I want to make sure that he doesn't go into shock.
388	00:28:15	00:28:18	Look at me, Reggie. Open your eyes, look at me.
389	00:28:25	00:28:26	Good.
390	00:28:29	00:28:31	Okay.
391	00:28:32	00:28:36	Frankie, Reggie's having a reaction to the chemicals in this room.
392	00:28:36	00:28:38	He's been in here too long and so have you.
393	00:28:39	00:28:40	We've to get the both of you out of here.
394	00:28:40	00:28:41	No, no, no, no.
395	00:28:41	00:28:43	What do you think I am, stupid?
396	00:28:43	00:28:45	I think you care about what happens to Reggie.
397	00:28:45	00:28:47	Frankie, let him help me. Oh, come on, Reg.
398	00:28:47	00:28:50	Don't be on their side. What, are you stuck on stupid, too?
399	00:28:50	00:28:52	Can't you see they're playing you?!
400	00:28:52	00:28:54	You know, that's your problem.
401	00:28:54	00:28:55	You always let people sucker you.
402	00:28:55	00:28:58	My problem was I tried to help you.
403	00:28:58	00:29:00	I should've just let you die in the streets, man.
404	00:29:07	00:29:09	Mr. Book Smart.
405	00:29:09	00:29:11	Man, you ain't that smart.
406	00:29:11	00:29:13	You don't know nothing about the real grind like I do.
407	00:29:13	00:29:15	The real grind, Frankie?
408	00:29:15	00:29:17	Yeah. The real grind?
409	00:29:17	00:29:18	Yeah.
410	00:29:18	00:29:20	The only thing you know is a gun.
411	00:29:20	00:29:22	Without that gun, you're nothing!
412	00:29:23	00:29:24	I'm nothing?!
413	00:29:24	00:29:28	Man, without me, you wouldn't even have a dime for grad school!
414	00:29:28	00:29:32	I'm the one who turned your little chemistry projects into paper!
415	00:29:33	00:29:35	And then you want to go pay off Sweets like a chump.
416	00:29:35	00:29:37	Man, you didn't need to pay for protection!
417	00:29:37	00:29:38	Talking about, you need protection, this and that!
418	00:29:38	00:29:40	You didn't need protection! You had me!
419	00:29:40	00:29:41	I'm the one who killed Sweets!
420	00:29:42	00:29:44	I'm the one who protected your ass when you needed it!
421	00:29:44	00:29:45	That was me! Me!
422	00:29:45	00:29:47	Look at me, Frankie!
423	00:29:47	00:29:48	What?!
424	00:29:48	00:29:50	He's bleeding.
425	00:29:50	00:29:53	Sit back, Reggie, sit back, sit back.
426	00:29:58	00:30:02	All right, Frankie, he's gonna die if I don't help him.
427	00:30:02	00:30:05	You've got the gun-- that means you're in charge, so you better make a decision.
428	00:30:05	00:30:08	Okay.
429	00:30:08	00:30:10	Do something, whatever.
430	00:30:10	00:30:14	I need, um, a towel, some kind of cloth to clean up this wound.
431	00:30:14	00:30:16	I have to irrigate the wound.
432	00:30:16	00:30:17	I need alcohol or water.
433	00:30:17	00:30:19	Do you have any of that here in the lab?
434	00:30:19	00:30:21	We also have to seal up all those chemicals.
435	00:30:22	00:30:24	Yeah, okay.
436	00:30:24	00:30:25	Go.
437	00:30:28	00:30:30	Um...
438	00:30:30	00:30:31	Here...
439	00:30:31	00:30:33	Here are paper towels.
440	00:30:34	00:30:36	Uh... fresh water over there.
441	00:30:36	00:30:38	(closes door) We don't have any lids here.
442	00:30:38	00:30:41	But I have some tape in my kit that will work, okay?
443	00:30:45	00:30:47	Okay. Go.
444	00:30:53	00:30:56	(radio squawks) What the hell are you doing?!
445	00:30:58	00:31:00	Frankie! You calling the cops, huh?!
446	00:31:00	00:31:02	Hey...
447	00:31:02	00:31:05	Is that what you doing, Miss Smart-Aleck, huh?!
448	00:31:05	00:31:06	Leave it! Drop it!
449	00:31:06	00:31:08	Listen to me. If I don't pick up that radio...
450	00:31:08	00:31:11	it's going to send out a horizontal alert.
451	00:31:11	00:31:15	Now, that means the police will know that we're in trouble within 30 seconds.
452	00:31:16	00:31:18	So just let me pick it up, okay?
453	00:31:20	00:31:22	Turn it off.
454	00:31:22	00:31:23	Turn it off!
455	00:31:24	00:31:26	T-Turn it off! Turn it off!
456	00:31:26	00:31:31	Ray e-mailed me photos from the PCP lab, one of which includes a surveillance monitor.
457	00:31:32	00:31:34	The suspects have a clear view of the front of the house.
458	00:31:34	00:31:36	We got a three-man entry team right here.
459	00:31:36	00:31:37	We'll find an alternate way in.
460	00:31:37	00:31:39	I'm running the show here, okay?
461	00:31:39	00:31:42	Hey, we got an open mic.
462	00:31:42	00:31:44	Look, tell me who's going to help me here with Reggie.
463	00:31:44	00:31:46	I need another pair of hands.
464	00:31:46	00:31:48	Reggie and Frankie are both in there.
465	00:31:48	00:31:49	Are you going to help me?
466	00:31:49	00:31:50	Sounds like Reggie's injured.
467	00:31:50	00:31:54	Which means there's probably only one gun in there-- Frankie's.
468	00:31:54	00:31:56	Get your... get your little nurse lady to help you.
469	00:31:56	00:31:57	That's right, go over there.
470	00:31:57	00:32:00	Go help my cousin.
471	00:32:00	00:32:03	Frankie, listen to me.
472	00:32:03	00:32:05	You haven't hurt anyone yet.
473	00:32:05	00:32:09	But if you... if you pull that trigger, that .22 is going to change everything.
474	00:32:09	00:32:11	Frankie's got the .22.
475	00:32:11	00:32:13	Sweets was killed with a .22.
476	00:32:13	00:32:16	I haven't hurt anyone yet?
477	00:32:16	00:32:17	Is that what you just said?
478	00:32:19	00:32:23	I wasted a guy, okay?
479	00:32:23	00:32:24	I killed a gangbanger.
480	00:32:30	00:32:33	It's not like the court's going to execute me.
481	00:32:33	00:32:34	I'm only 14!
482	00:32:34	00:32:35	So, go ahead!
483	00:32:35	00:32:37	Just do something! Just fix my cousin!
484	00:32:38	00:32:40	What the hell are they doing here?
485	00:32:40	00:32:43	It's a damn news chopper.
486	00:32:43	00:32:44	This is restricted air space.
487	00:32:44	00:32:46	We'll get them out of here.
488	00:32:52	00:32:54	Cops?
489	00:32:56	00:32:59	It was the radio!
490	00:33:00	00:33:01	You tricked me, you bitch!
491	00:33:06	00:33:07	Frankie, that's enough.
492	00:33:07	00:33:08	You!
493	00:33:23	00:33:26	If he dies...
494	00:33:27	00:33:29	then we all die.
495	00:33:34	00:33:38	Frankie, just let me answer the phone and tell them that we're okay. (phone ringing)
496	00:33:38	00:33:41	No. No, no, they don't need to know squat.
497	00:33:41	00:33:43	Look, Reggie has got to get to a hospital.
498	00:33:43	00:33:44	But you said you could fix him.
499	00:33:44	00:33:46	I don't have the proper equipment.
500	00:33:46	00:33:47	He needs a surgeon.
501	00:33:47	00:33:49	I'm not a surgeon. But you're a doctor, right?
502	00:33:49	00:33:50	Yes.
503	00:33:50	00:33:52	Yeah, so, so, so figure out something.
504	00:33:52	00:33:54	(phone ringing) Doc...
505	00:33:54	00:33:56	I don't feel good.
506	00:33:56	00:33:58	Everything is spinning.
507	00:33:58	00:34:01	Um, all right, I have, uh...
508	00:34:01	00:34:03	Well, I can use the ether to put you under.
509	00:34:03	00:34:05	I've got a scalpel in my kit to make the incision.
510	00:34:05	00:34:08	And hemostats to clamp off the veins before I remove the glass.
511	00:34:08	00:34:10	Um, I still need other things.
512	00:34:10	00:34:15	I-I-I need, uh, gauze, sterile gauze, a needle and thread, antiseptic.
513	00:34:15	00:34:17	We don't have any of that stuff.
514	00:34:17	00:34:19	Okay, I have all of that. It's up in the first aid kit.
515	00:34:19	00:34:22	But it's in the truck, upstairs.
516	00:34:24	00:34:27	No...!
517	00:34:27	00:34:29	No. No one's going anywhere.
518	00:34:29	00:34:31	I can help Reggie, but I need the kit.
519	00:34:31	00:34:32	I have to have it.
520	00:34:32	00:34:33	Let me tell them I'm coming up there.
521	00:34:37	00:34:41	This is another... another one of your tricks, isn't it?
522	00:34:41	00:34:42	This isn't a trick, Frankie.
523	00:34:42	00:34:46	I want us all to walk away from this, okay?
524	00:34:48	00:34:50	This is Adams.
525	00:34:50	00:34:52	Are you and Langston okay?
526	00:34:52	00:34:53	Yeah, yeah. We're all okay.
527	00:34:54	00:34:58	Without alerting the suspects, can you describe the situation in detail?
528	00:34:58	00:35:00	We have a kid down here who is injured.
529	00:35:00	00:35:02	He needs medical attention.
530	00:35:02	00:35:05	I'm going to come up and get the first aid kit from the truck.
531	00:35:05	00:35:06	Langston is going to stay here.
532	00:35:10	00:35:13	I have to be able to come back down.
533	00:35:15	00:35:17	Okay.
534	00:35:17	00:35:19	She's got to go back in, or Langston's dead.
535	00:35:19	00:35:21	Jack, give me a walkie.
536	00:35:22	00:35:25	I want to talk to her. The front entrance and the street are covered by surveillance.
537	00:35:25	00:35:26	They'll be waiting for us to make our move.
538	00:35:26	00:35:28	Okay, I got it. We got to try.
539	00:35:28	00:35:30	I can't just sit here and do nothing.
540	00:35:30	00:35:33	The tree behind the Denali is the edge of frame.
541	00:35:33	00:35:34	Stay behind that.
542	00:35:34	00:35:37	Right. Yeah, I got that.
543	00:35:57	00:35:59	Why is she going to the back of the truck?
544	00:35:59	00:36:01	We keep the first aid kit in the back of the truck, Frankie.
545	00:36:01	00:36:03	You have to trust us.
546	00:36:04	00:36:06	She better not run.
547	00:36:10	00:36:12	How you holding up?
548	00:36:16	00:36:18	How many guns?
549	00:36:20	00:36:21	You armed?
550	00:36:26	00:36:27	Then you know what you got to do.
551	00:36:28	00:36:30	Frankie, bring me that bottle of ether, please.
552	00:36:37	00:36:39	Yes, that's it. Put it down there.
553	00:36:39	00:36:41	Thank you.
554	00:36:50	00:36:52	I came right back.
555	00:36:56	00:37:03	Frankie, I'm going to open this up so you can see for yourself no tricks.
556	00:37:07	00:37:10	Please, please, don't... don't touch any of that.
557	00:37:10	00:37:14	You'll contaminate it, and Reggie could get infected.
558	00:37:14	00:37:16	Look, I'm going to need another pair of hands.
559	00:37:16	00:37:18	Which one of you is going to help me?
560	00:37:18	00:37:19	Relax, Frankie.
561	00:37:19	00:37:22	You just worry about how you're going to get us out of here.
562	00:37:26	00:37:28	Be strong.
563	00:37:28	00:37:31	Riley, I want you to apply pressure here.
564	00:37:31	00:37:34	That's good. With your fingertips, just like that.
565	00:37:34	00:37:35	Very good.
566	00:37:35	00:37:41	Reggie, I want you to understand exactly what I'm going to do.
567	00:37:41	00:37:43	First, I'm going to put you under.
568	00:37:43	00:37:51	Once you're under, I'm going to stop the bleeding, and once that's done, I'm going to try and remove the glass. All right?
569	00:37:51	00:37:54	Listen, tell my mom I love her.
570	00:37:54	00:37:56	You tell her that yourself.
571	00:37:58	00:38:01	You know, I only wanted to become a real scientist.
572	00:38:03	00:38:05	Maybe do some good.
573	00:38:06	00:38:09	I guess I thought I could handle everything.
574	00:38:09	00:38:12	Things got away from me.
575	00:38:16	00:38:17	Try and relax.
576	00:38:17	00:38:20	I shouldn't have run.
577	00:38:20	00:38:23	Don't fight it.
578	00:38:23	00:38:24	Just relax.
579	00:38:24	00:38:26	Take a couple of deep breaths.
580	00:38:49	00:38:51	I have to cut him, Frankie.
581	00:38:51	00:38:55	It's very difficult to concentrate with you pointing that gun at me.
582	00:38:59	00:39:01	We can pump in CS gas.
583	00:39:01	00:39:04	On the west end of the house, there's a vent that leads directly into the lab.
584	00:39:04	00:39:07	Except we're talking about a 14-year-old kid with a gun that he's not afraid to use.
585	00:39:07	00:39:09	The gas could cause him to panic.
586	00:39:09	00:39:10	Yeah, one wild shot and he blows up the whole block.
587	00:39:11	00:39:12	Riley's armed.
588	00:39:12	00:39:13	She's trained for this.
589	00:39:13	00:39:16	If she gets the opportunity, she will take it.
590	00:39:16	00:39:18	One thing we got going for us, time is on our side.
591	00:39:18	00:39:20	I say we trust them.
592	00:39:20	00:39:22	So do I.
593	00:39:28	00:39:30	We need more towels.
594	00:39:36	00:39:39	Hand me another hemostat.
595	00:39:47	00:39:48	Okay.
596	00:39:56	00:39:59	All right. Ready? Yeah.
597	00:40:00	00:40:01	And... here we go.
598	00:40:01	00:40:02	Okay.
599	00:40:06	00:40:08	Oh, my God! What did you do to him?
600	00:40:08	00:40:11	I need help. He's not going to die, is he?
601	00:40:11	00:40:14	I need someone to put pressure on the artery.
602	00:40:16	00:40:18	Give me the gun.
603	00:40:20	00:40:24	I need someone to apply pressure to the artery while I make a pressure bandage, Frankie.
604	00:40:24	00:40:26	I need your hands.
605	00:40:26	00:40:28	Reggie needs your help.
606	00:40:29	00:40:30	Give me the gun.
607	00:40:30	00:40:32	Come on, do some good for a change.
608	00:40:35	00:40:37	Frankie, I need you over here now.
609	00:40:49	00:40:51	You see where my hand is?
610	00:40:51	00:40:52	Put your hand there. You feel it?
611	00:40:52	00:40:54	You got it? That's it, right there.
612	00:40:54	00:40:55	Keep the pressure tight. Good.
613	00:40:55	00:40:59	Code Four, suspect's disarmed.
614	00:40:59	00:41:01	We need an ambulance, Code Three.
615	00:41:22	00:41:24	Have your people treat him fairly, Captain.
616	00:41:24	00:41:26	He doesn't have to be a lost cause.
617	00:41:29	00:41:31	Somehow, I knew you were going to say that.
