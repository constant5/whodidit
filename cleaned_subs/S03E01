0	00:00:14	00:00:18	Start with you, sir?
1	00:00:21	00:00:22	Check.
2	00:00:22	00:00:25	He doesn't bet, but he keeps a beat.
3	00:00:25	00:00:28	You check. Someone's on a flush draw.
4	00:00:28	00:00:30	Mm, I'll take the free card. Check.
5	00:00:31	00:00:32	I'll check.
6	00:00:34	00:00:35	What do you got, Candyman?
7	00:00:37	00:00:38	Check.
8	00:00:42	00:00:44	Thank you very much.
9	00:00:50	00:00:53	Stiff... typical.
10	00:00:53	00:00:56	I can bet...
11	00:00:56	00:00:57	make it...
12	00:00:57	00:00:58	$2,000.
13	00:00:58	00:01:00	The grinder speaks.
14	00:01:03	00:01:06	We raise $4,000.
15	00:01:06	00:01:07	Call the bet.
16	00:01:07	00:01:09	$2,000. Raise you $2,000.
17	00:01:09	00:01:12	It's all about you, Grinder.
18	00:01:14	00:01:18	I'm going to go get a $2,000 slice of pizza.
19	00:01:20	00:01:25	Well... might as well make it a poker game.
20	00:01:25	00:01:27	I'm all in.
21	00:01:30	00:01:32	What do you got, Southern Iowa?
22	00:01:32	00:01:35	A pain in the ass to my right side.
23	00:01:37	00:01:40	Um... yeah, you might have a winning hand.
24	00:01:40	00:01:43	You might be just trying to buy it.
25	00:01:43	00:01:46	Johnny Chan thought I was too old, too back in the '86 series.
26	00:01:46	00:01:49	You mean, the series where the ball went through Buckner's legs?
27	00:01:50	00:01:52	Save the story, kid. Here's what's what.
28	00:01:52	00:01:54	I got aces. What do you got?
29	00:01:54	00:01:57	Maybe you got trips, maybe king, queen.
30	00:01:57	00:01:59	Maybe you got two pair.
31	00:01:59	00:02:02	Ace hits the board...
32	00:02:02	00:02:03	I win.
33	00:02:03	00:02:04	Club hits the board...
34	00:02:04	00:02:05	I win.
35	00:02:05	00:02:10	Eight, nine hits the board...
36	00:02:10	00:02:11	I win.
37	00:02:11	00:02:13	Here's the math, old man.
38	00:02:13	00:02:14	13 of every suit in the deck.
39	00:02:14	00:02:15	I see three clubs.
40	00:02:15	00:02:19	That means you've got ten coming 37 cards left in the deck.
41	00:02:19	00:02:21	You like those odds?
42	00:02:21	00:02:23	I like 'em a lot better than I like you.
43	00:03:00	00:03:02	You lost?
44	00:03:03	00:03:05	I'm listening.
45	00:03:05	00:03:07	For what?
46	00:03:07	00:03:11	E-C-G... C major chord.
47	00:03:12	00:03:14	All the slots play the same notes-- perfect harmony.
48	00:03:14	00:03:15	Makes people happy.
49	00:03:16	00:03:18	Yeah, except when you're losing.
50	00:03:18	00:03:20	Then you don't hear anything.
51	00:03:28	00:03:29	Hey, guys.
52	00:03:29	00:03:31	Hey, Hank.
53	00:03:31	00:03:32	Sara with you?
54	00:03:32	00:03:33	She's over there.
55	00:03:33	00:03:35	Tell her I said hi. Will do.
56	00:03:37	00:03:38	Thank you.
57	00:03:50	00:03:50	Doyle Pfeiffer.
58	00:03:50	00:03:52	Best poker player in the world.
59	00:03:52	00:03:55	18 hours ago he sits down at the table a healthy man.
60	00:03:55	00:03:59	A half an hour ago, he drops dead... in his chair.
61	00:03:59	00:04:00	That's a big pot.
62	00:04:00	00:04:03	Casino's not satisfied with a heart attack?
63	00:04:03	00:04:04	We're not satisfied. This is high stakes.
64	00:04:04	00:04:06	We're treating it like a murder.
65	00:04:06	00:04:08	Suspicious circs.
66	00:04:08	00:04:09	Mmm.
67	00:04:09	00:04:11	You ever played poker, Warrick?
68	00:04:11	00:04:14	Nah. Poker's not gambling.
69	00:04:14	00:04:15	It's playing against percentages.
70	00:04:15	00:04:17	It's a skill.
71	00:04:17	00:04:18	I like to play for the thrill.
72	00:04:22	00:04:23	Whose hand was this?
73	00:04:23	00:04:25	Mine!
74	00:04:25	00:04:28	That pot's mine. He dropped dead before he went all in!
75	00:04:28	00:04:32	Some young, loud-mouthed player thinks it's his pot. Mmm.
76	00:04:32	00:04:33	Excuse me.
77	00:04:33	00:04:38	Two cowboys-- one in the flop, trips.
78	00:04:41	00:04:42	Pair of aces.
79	00:04:42	00:04:44	No river card, though.
80	00:04:44	00:04:46	Burn one, turn one.
81	00:04:50	00:04:51	Ace of spades.
82	00:04:54	00:04:56	The death card.
83	00:05:40	00:05:42	Who called it in?
84	00:05:42	00:05:45	Western LVU ornithology student.
85	00:05:45	00:05:48	Saw turkey vultures. Got circs.
86	00:05:52	00:05:56	Birds of prey beat maggots to a body-- impressive.
87	00:05:56	00:05:59	Gunshot. Entry just below the cheek.
88	00:05:59	00:06:01	Not much blood, no blood pools.
89	00:06:01	00:06:02	Means he wasn't shot here.
90	00:06:02	00:06:04	Where exactly is here?
91	00:06:04	00:06:08	Frenchman Airfield-- it's an old landing strip hasn't been used since the '60s.
92	00:06:08	00:06:11	Well, it's flat.
93	00:06:11	00:06:13	You could still land a plane here.
94	00:06:13	00:06:15	Yeah, but in the middle of nowhere?
95	00:06:15	00:06:17	Perfect place to dump a body.
96	00:06:30	00:06:31	I got chocolate.
97	00:06:31	00:06:32	What color is it?
98	00:06:32	00:06:35	Green... you know what they say about the green ones?
99	00:06:35	00:06:37	Bag it separately.
100	00:06:37	00:06:39	But you agree with me, right?
101	00:06:39	00:06:40	It's a forfeit.
102	00:06:40	00:06:43	Doyle never went all in.
103	00:06:43	00:06:45	He can wipe his ass with those aces river card or no river card.
104	00:06:45	00:06:47	I beat him. It's a forfeit.
105	00:06:47	00:06:49	Look... look. Shh...
106	00:06:49	00:06:50	See this badge?
107	00:06:50	00:06:52	I'm not with the gaming commission.
108	00:06:52	00:06:54	You got a problem with gaming, see the guy in the bad suit.
109	00:06:56	00:07:01	pending an investigation, it's our pot.
110	00:07:03	00:07:05	Is that what I think it is?
111	00:07:05	00:07:06	Urine, maybe.
112	00:07:06	00:07:10	Game like this, leaving the table early could be perceived as a sign of weakness.
113	00:07:10	00:07:12	Tell me they Scotchguard these things.
114	00:07:12	00:07:18	Why don't you tell me when you take it back to the lab and process it? Yay.
115	00:07:22	00:07:24	How is it that you know so much about poker?
116	00:07:24	00:07:28	It's how I financed my first body farm in college.
117	00:07:28	00:07:29	You're kidding.
118	00:07:29	00:07:31	Wow. I'm impressed.
119	00:07:32	00:07:34	I mean, the fact that you sat at a table with actual living beings.
120	00:07:34	00:07:35	Well...
121	00:07:35	00:07:38	poker's not a game of interaction.
122	00:07:38	00:07:40	It's a game of observation.
123	00:07:40	00:07:42	I used to study people.
124	00:07:42	00:07:45	And then I guess I, uh...
125	00:07:45	00:07:47	got bored.
126	00:07:47	00:07:49	Now I study evidence.
127	00:07:49	00:07:52	What I don't get is it's not like we've never talked about gambling before.
128	00:07:52	00:07:53	How come you never mention it?
129	00:07:54	00:07:57	Same reason a good player hides his tells.
130	00:07:59	00:08:02	He doesn't want to be exposed.
131	00:08:06	00:08:11	You know why Steve Wynn hired Bobby Baldwin to run the Nugget, then the Mirage, the Bellagio?
132	00:08:11	00:08:14	He was a great poker player, great thinker.
133	00:08:14	00:08:16	I did not know that.
134	00:08:16	00:08:17	Stop the world.
135	00:08:20	00:08:23	No violaceous lividity prominent above the level of the shoulders.
136	00:08:23	00:08:24	So no heart attack?
137	00:08:24	00:08:28	Not ruling out stroke but check out the Mees lines in his fingernails.
138	00:08:31	00:08:36	Milky, vomit-like fluid in the corners of his mouth...
139	00:08:36	00:08:41	Single blue line running across his gums...
140	00:08:41	00:08:43	all the earmarks of lead poisoning.
141	00:08:43	00:08:45	I haven't seen a case of lead poisoning in years.
142	00:08:46	00:08:48	What's that look like to you?
143	00:08:52	00:08:55	It looks like he's got a bullet in his thigh.
144	00:08:55	00:08:58	It's probably been there quite a while leeching lead into his system.
145	00:08:58	00:09:00	Enough to kill him?
146	00:09:00	00:09:06	I'll know better when I get the tox screen back and examine the brain.
147	00:09:37	00:09:39	Everyone has a tell, don't they, Lita?
148	00:09:39	00:09:41	A whiskey sour, huh?
149	00:09:41	00:09:44	Yeah, I'm a Thug Passion man, myself.
150	00:09:44	00:09:47	It's a Tupack thing.
151	00:09:47	00:09:48	Tupac?
152	00:09:49	00:09:52	So, what does your paramedic like to drink?
153	00:09:52	00:09:57	I bet with a name like Hank he's probably got some ho's sipping on 'yac.
154	00:09:57	00:09:59	Yac? Cognac? No.
155	00:09:59	00:10:03	Ho's? I'm not going there and, um, that's none of your business.
156	00:10:03	00:10:05	It's nobody's business, as a matter of fact.
157	00:10:05	00:10:11	All right, well, I won't tell Warrick and Nick about Hank on one condition...
158	00:10:11	00:10:15	You tell me what he's got that I don't got?
159	00:10:20	00:10:23	There was tetrahydrozoline in the victim's drink.
160	00:10:23	00:10:25	Uh, I never got my answer.
161	00:10:25	00:10:27	I got mine.
162	00:10:27	00:10:29	You don't even like Tupac, Greg.
163	00:10:34	00:10:37	She killed him with eyedrops?
164	00:10:38	00:10:39	Well, it's not that far-fetched.
165	00:10:39	00:10:42	Tetrahydrozoline is the active ingredient in eye drops.
166	00:10:42	00:10:43	It's a vasoconstrictor.
167	00:10:43	00:10:45	Obviously, it's great for bloodshot eyes.
168	00:10:48	00:10:57	you ingest eyedrops it constricts the blood vessels throughout your body maybe even spike your blood pressure perhaps even cause a stroke.
169	00:10:57	00:10:58	It's a perfect poison.
170	00:10:58	00:10:59	It's odorless, colorless, tasteless.
171	00:10:59	00:11:01	Doyle would have never known it was in his drink.
172	00:11:01	00:11:03	Only one thing.
173	00:11:03	00:11:05	What's that?
174	00:11:05	00:11:09	Lita Gibbons was the last one to sit down at the table and she never left her chair.
175	00:11:09	00:11:11	So...
176	00:11:11	00:11:14	how'd the eyedrops get into his drink?
177	00:11:16	00:11:18	Hey, Catherine. Nice timing.
178	00:11:18	00:11:20	I just finished my prelim on your John Doe.
179	00:11:20	00:11:22	No longer a John Doe.
180	00:11:22	00:11:23	Got a name and a rap sheet.
181	00:11:23	00:11:27	Jace Felder, busted for selling meth in '98.
182	00:11:27	00:11:29	His prints are in AFIS.
183	00:11:29	00:11:31	Your turn.
184	00:11:33	00:11:35	perforating gunshot wound through and through.
185	00:11:35	00:11:39	Wound penetrated the zygomatic arch exited the right temple.
186	00:11:42	00:11:44	Check out his right eardrum.
187	00:11:52	00:11:54	His eardrum's gone.
188	00:11:54	00:11:59	Presence of blood indicates the tympanic membrane was blown out shortly before death.
189	00:11:59	00:12:02	We found him on an airstrip.
190	00:12:02	00:12:05	Maybe he was too close to a jet engine.
191	00:12:05	00:12:09	Jet engine? Well, that would explain his clothing.
192	00:12:09	00:12:11	A gasoline smell. Sent if off to Trace.
193	00:12:13	00:12:16	perimortem bruising on his torso.
194	00:12:16	00:12:18	Two symmetrical lines.
195	00:12:18	00:12:22	Looks like it could be from a harness or a seat belt.
196	00:12:22	00:12:24	Mm-hmm.
197	00:12:24	00:12:27	What was this guy a top gun?
198	00:13:07	00:13:09	Well, this was no plane!
199	00:13:09	00:13:12	Marks are too narrow. no center wheel, and...
200	00:13:12	00:13:15	when was the last time a plane lost a rearview mirror?
201	00:13:15	00:13:19	Actually, we're looking at two.
202	00:13:19	00:13:20	Two?
203	00:13:20	00:13:25	Yeah, I've got fresh marks at the head of the runway two sets, both parallel, so...
204	00:13:25	00:13:27	My guess is one car spun out here...
205	00:13:27	00:13:28	Man, you are way ahead of me.
206	00:13:28	00:13:30	Yeah, well, I been here a while.
207	00:13:30	00:13:33	Over there another set of treads going straight ahead, so...
208	00:13:33	00:13:35	Right.
209	00:13:35	00:13:39	And you only lay down treads when your wheels aren't rolling smoothly.
210	00:13:39	00:13:41	Panic braking?
211	00:13:41	00:13:44	Sudden boost of acceleration?
212	00:13:44	00:13:45	Race?
213	00:13:45	00:13:46	I think so, yeah.
214	00:13:46	00:13:48	Drag racing?
215	00:13:49	00:13:50	Or street racing.
216	00:13:50	00:13:52	Ah... There's a reason it's illegal.
217	00:13:52	00:13:54	Yeah.
218	00:13:54	00:13:56	Kids end up dead.
219	00:14:00	00:14:01	Midnight drags.
220	00:14:02	00:14:04	My brother was a gearhead.
221	00:14:04	00:14:07	Rebuilt a '65 GTO with three carbs.
222	00:14:07	00:14:08	Ran the thing flat out.
223	00:14:08	00:14:11	Zero to a buck-13 in a quarter mile.
224	00:14:11	00:14:13	So your brother's cooler than you.
225	00:14:14	00:14:15	No.
226	00:14:15	00:14:16	No, not really.
227	00:14:17	00:14:18	Welcome to pre-game.
228	00:14:18	00:14:23	Every gear-banger in Clark County all with the same question-- What are you runnin' under there?
229	00:14:23	00:14:25	Foreplay is foreplay.
230	00:14:25	00:14:26	So, when do they race?
231	00:14:26	00:14:31	It's not so much when it's where; racing locations are always in play.
232	00:14:31	00:14:33	Once the call comes in the street will empty out in seconds.
233	00:14:34	00:14:35	They go all the way out to Frenchman Airfield from here?
234	00:14:35	00:14:37	Only when it rains.
235	00:14:37	00:14:38	It rained last night.
236	00:14:38	00:14:40	Rain brings up the oil from the streets.
237	00:14:41	00:14:43	They got to go somewhere to get some traction.
238	00:14:43	00:14:45	The desert.
239	00:14:45	00:14:47	Centrifugal supercharger.
240	00:14:47	00:14:48	Nice.
241	00:14:48	00:14:56	Yeah, it's like the compressor side of a turbo but instead of spinning on the exhaust it goes through a gearset to the crank.
242	00:14:56	00:14:58	More power, no extra weight.
243	00:14:58	00:14:59	Every girl's dream.
244	00:14:59	00:15:00	Ooh.
245	00:15:00	00:15:01	I like that.
246	00:15:03	00:15:04	Yeah, check the nitrous speed.
247	00:15:04	00:15:06	NOS.
248	00:15:06	00:15:08	Nitrous Oxide System.
249	00:15:08	00:15:10	Nitrous Oxide as in speed?
250	00:15:10	00:15:16	Well, speed is ultimately limited by how fast you can mix oxygen with fuel and ignite it.
251	00:15:16	00:15:18	Regular air is about 20% oxygen.
252	00:15:18	00:15:19	Nitrous is 40.
253	00:15:19	00:15:21	Double the burn, double the power.
254	00:15:29	00:15:33	So the sudden boost of acceleration could account for the treads back at the airstrip.
255	00:15:36	00:15:37	Check out that racing harness.
256	00:15:37	00:15:40	Same as the bruises found on the victim.
257	00:15:59	00:16:00	Hey! You deaf?
258	00:16:00	00:16:01	Oh, thanks a lot.
259	00:16:01	00:16:02	What's up?
260	00:16:02	00:16:04	I'm Thumpy G.
261	00:16:04	00:16:07	A jackhammer is about 50 decibels quieter.
262	00:16:07	00:16:14	You know the only way to beat a jackhammer is to bust 15,000 watts of Run DMC's Dumb Girl or-or LL Cool J's Goin' Back to Cali.
263	00:16:14	00:16:15	You know?
264	00:16:16	00:16:17	Hey, G, what's up?
265	00:16:17	00:16:18	whaddaup, dog.
266	00:16:18	00:16:22	So, Thumpy you blow out a lot of eardrums?
267	00:16:22	00:16:23	I try to.
268	00:16:23	00:16:24	You know this cat?
269	00:16:24	00:16:26	Jace Felder.
270	00:16:26	00:16:27	Negative.
271	00:16:27	00:16:28	What's up, baby?
272	00:16:28	00:16:29	Hey how you doing?
273	00:16:29	00:16:30	Hey, Thumper!
274	00:16:30	00:16:35	How about we impound your car, seize your stereo system and charge you with disturbing the peace?
275	00:16:35	00:16:38	Oh, she is hot, but now it's real hot.
276	00:16:38	00:16:39	All right. Yo, do.
277	00:16:40	00:16:42	It's coming back to me.
278	00:16:42	00:16:43	We're all ears.
279	00:16:45	00:16:48	Wow, is this new?
280	00:16:48	00:16:49	Yup. Turbo.
281	00:16:49	00:16:51	I like it.
282	00:16:51	00:16:52	You need any help?
283	00:16:52	00:16:54	Nope.
284	00:16:54	00:16:57	Ah.
285	00:17:02	00:17:04	Cool.
286	00:17:16	00:17:19	Want to step back a little?
287	00:17:33	00:17:35	So, how many pots is that?
288	00:17:35	00:17:36	Too many.
289	00:17:36	00:17:38	Yeah?
290	00:17:42	00:17:44	Lita Gibbons?
291	00:17:46	00:17:48	Why don't you sit this one out?
292	00:17:48	00:17:54	Come with me. ♪ Another day... ♪ Yeah.
293	00:17:54	00:17:55	I live here.
294	00:17:55	00:17:57	Tangiers is a damn smokehouse.
295	00:17:58	00:18:00	Bothers my eyes.
296	00:18:00	00:18:01	You use eyedrops?
297	00:18:01	00:18:02	Bottles and bottles.
298	00:18:03	00:18:04	Can we see them?
299	00:18:04	00:18:06	Pick a pocket.
300	00:18:08	00:18:11	Miss Gibbons what color are your eyes?
301	00:18:11	00:18:13	Brown.
302	00:18:13	00:18:16	Well, why are you wearing just one contact lens?
303	00:18:16	00:18:19	I have 10/30 vision in my right eye.
304	00:18:25	00:18:28	Why is it tinted?
305	00:18:34	00:18:37	We're going to need to take that contact lens.
306	00:18:37	00:18:41	And your eyedrops.
307	00:18:45	00:18:48	You ever held a legend's brain?
308	00:18:48	00:18:50	Brain cried uncle.
309	00:18:50	00:18:53	U-N-C-A-L.
310	00:18:53	00:19:02	Uncal herniation-- a swelling at the base of the temporal lobe which compresses the posterior cerebral artery resulting in a stroke.
311	00:19:02	00:19:04	Let's back up here.
312	00:19:04	00:19:08	Victim had chronic lead poisoning from a bullet that was left in his leg.
313	00:19:08	00:19:09	Tox is pending.
314	00:19:09	00:19:15	But what you're thinking is the lead from the bullet made his brain swell up with... uncal herniation?
315	00:19:15	00:19:16	Wild card was blood pressure.
316	00:19:16	00:19:19	If he kept that under control he might have had another 20 years.
317	00:19:19	00:19:26	Except that someone put tetrahydrozoline in his drink which made his blood pressure spike and now we got his brain in a bowl.
318	00:19:26	00:19:28	Yup.
319	00:19:28	00:19:30	Nasty.
320	00:19:32	00:19:33	Michelangelo?
321	00:19:34	00:19:35	Yup.
322	00:19:35	00:19:37	It's an odd name for a mechanic.
323	00:19:37	00:19:40	Well, Thumpy G said he was an artist.
324	00:19:40	00:19:42	Michael... Angelo.
325	00:19:42	00:19:43	Nick Stokes, Catherine Willows.
326	00:19:43	00:19:45	Vegas Crime Lab.
327	00:19:46	00:19:47	Wow.
328	00:19:47	00:19:49	Yeah.
329	00:19:49	00:19:51	So how long you been racing cars?
330	00:19:51	00:19:52	I don't race 'em. I soup 'em.
331	00:19:52	00:19:55	And at 650 an hour, you're costing me money.
332	00:19:55	00:19:57	And you're costing us time.
333	00:19:57	00:19:58	We're investigating a murder.
334	00:19:58	00:20:00	Jace Felder, right?
335	00:20:00	00:20:01	That's right.
336	00:20:01	00:20:03	How do you know?
337	00:20:03	00:20:04	Small world.
338	00:20:04	00:20:05	Shame about what happened.
339	00:20:05	00:20:07	He was the Steve McQueen of Southern Nevada.
340	00:20:07	00:20:10	We're looking for the kid he raced the night he was shot.
341	00:20:10	00:20:12	Why come to me?
342	00:20:12	00:20:14	Thumpy G dropped your name, man.
343	00:20:14	00:20:16	Said he was driving a Michelangelo.
344	00:20:16	00:20:19	I have many works of art.
345	00:20:19	00:20:20	Which one?
346	00:20:20	00:20:23	A blue Honda, blue rims, tinted windows.
347	00:20:30	00:20:31	Works of art.
348	00:20:32	00:20:35	Billie Holiday.
349	00:20:35	00:20:37	Built this baby for myself.
350	00:20:38	00:20:40	Sold it to some punk kid.
351	00:20:40	00:20:41	Never should have done that.
352	00:20:41	00:20:42	Sold out.
353	00:20:42	00:20:46	Kid walks in one day $100,000 price tag in his head.
354	00:20:46	00:20:48	Wants a racer off the showroom floor.
355	00:20:48	00:20:51	No custom, no waiting, right now.
356	00:20:51	00:20:53	Paid by check.
357	00:20:53	00:20:54	Silver spoon kid.
358	00:20:54	00:20:55	You got a copy of the check?
359	00:20:55	00:20:56	Tossed it.
360	00:20:56	00:20:57	Tossed it?
361	00:20:57	00:20:59	Never should have done that, either.
362	00:20:59	00:21:00	No.
363	00:21:00	00:21:03	All I know was, it was an insurance company check.
364	00:21:03	00:21:04	Third party.
365	00:21:04	00:21:05	Sat on it till it cleared.
366	00:21:08	00:21:09	Yeah?
367	00:21:09	00:21:10	Found Jace Felder's car.
368	00:21:10	00:21:12	Where?
369	00:21:12	00:21:13	Yeah, we were lucky.
370	00:21:13	00:21:14	It was right under our noses.
371	00:21:14	00:21:17	Uniform found it out on Gibson Road.
372	00:21:17	00:21:18	Tent sale.
373	00:21:18	00:21:22	The, uh, VIN number was scratched off but I ran the firewall.
374	00:21:22	00:21:24	Came back Jace Felder.
375	00:21:24	00:21:25	Who's the seller?
376	00:21:25	00:21:27	Uh, some guy named Steven Masters.
377	00:21:27	00:21:28	Well, make him an offer.
378	00:21:29	00:21:31	We'll take the car.
379	00:21:31	00:21:35	So, we meet again.
380	00:21:35	00:21:38	Lita Gibbons wasn't putting this on her nipples, was she?
381	00:21:38	00:21:40	You have been drinking too many Thug Passions.
382	00:21:40	00:21:41	The woman is twice your age.
383	00:21:42	00:21:44	She may be three times your age, Greg.
384	00:21:44	00:21:45	Old case. Sorry.
385	00:21:54	00:21:56	Well?
386	00:21:56	00:21:59	Well, uh, you'll get your answer when I get mine.
387	00:22:01	00:22:03	Hey, Grissom.
388	00:22:03	00:22:06	Hooked you up.
389	00:22:06	00:22:08	Is this the same color as the contact lens?
390	00:22:08	00:22:09	Only bigger.
391	00:22:09	00:22:11	Glass is my life.
392	00:22:11	00:22:13	All right, stick around.
393	00:22:13	00:22:14	I need your eyes.
394	00:22:14	00:22:16	As long as they stay in my head.
395	00:22:19	00:22:21	Find the aces.
396	00:22:21	00:22:23	How many are there?
397	00:22:26	00:22:27	Four.
398	00:22:34	00:22:35	First row, third card.
399	00:22:39	00:22:40	Second row, fourth card.
400	00:22:45	00:22:48	Third row, eighth card.
401	00:22:50	00:22:53	And, fourth row, third card.
402	00:22:53	00:22:55	Anaglyphics.
403	00:22:55	00:22:57	Color contrast to see hidden marks.
404	00:22:57	00:23:00	Lita Gibbons was playing the daub.
405	00:23:00	00:23:02	She was cheating.
406	00:23:02	00:23:04	She marked the cards with lip balm.
407	00:23:04	00:23:06	And that's all she was doing.
408	00:23:06	00:23:13	The victim's drink contained .05% tetrahydrozoline hydrocholoride and .25% zinc sulfate.
409	00:23:13	00:23:16	There was no zinc sulfate in any of Lita Gibbons' eyedrops.
410	00:23:16	00:23:17	It's a different formulation.
411	00:23:17	00:23:19	So she didn't kill Doyle Pfeiffer.
412	00:23:19	00:23:22	No. But someone's eyedrops did.
413	00:23:27	00:23:30	You're costing me money, here. I've got a second shift at the Monaco.
414	00:23:30	00:23:32	Well, you didn't seem too worried about money the other night.
415	00:23:32	00:23:34	We watched the surveillance tape.
416	00:23:34	00:23:38	Doyle Pfeiffer didn't even pass you a nickel yet you were all over him.
417	00:23:38	00:23:40	I can tell you've never served drinks.
418	00:23:40	00:23:45	Catch him in the right mood with the right pot he can make your month.
419	00:23:45	00:23:48	Is that why you were giving eyes to the California kid?
420	00:23:48	00:23:49	I wasn't making eyes with him.
421	00:23:49	00:23:52	You tipped some waitress $1,500 the other night?
422	00:23:52	00:23:55	You in business, or you in love?
423	00:23:55	00:23:57	I was running a hot streak, three kill pots in a row.
424	00:23:57	00:23:59	60 grand in 40 minutes-- I threw her a bone.
425	00:23:59	00:24:00	That all you threw her?
426	00:24:00	00:24:01	Put a shot in her?
427	00:24:01	00:24:03	Anything else I should know?
428	00:24:03	00:24:04	I mean, we're just talking here.
429	00:24:04	00:24:09	All I can say is for 1,500 bucks you get great service.
430	00:24:09	00:24:11	I'm a waitress, not a call girl.
431	00:24:11	00:24:13	I was playing one guy against the other.
432	00:24:13	00:24:14	You want to make money?
433	00:24:14	00:24:16	You bait.
434	00:24:16	00:24:18	Besides...
435	00:24:18	00:24:20	I thought Doyle had a heart attack.
436	00:24:20	00:24:21	He did, but he had help.
437	00:24:21	00:24:24	Someone put something in his drink.
438	00:24:37	00:24:38	What can I get you?
439	00:24:38	00:24:40	I'd like some information.
440	00:24:40	00:24:43	Do you know what happens when you beat a legend?
441	00:24:43	00:24:44	People see you different.
442	00:24:45	00:24:47	They-they play you different.
443	00:24:47	00:24:48	I wanted that edge.
444	00:24:48	00:24:50	All right, let's go with that-- an edge.
445	00:24:50	00:24:52	It does not play into my hand to have the guy dead.
446	00:24:54	00:24:57	The days of comping drinks sticking the hotel with the bill, those are done.
447	00:24:57	00:24:59	Everything's computerized down to the last drop.
448	00:24:59	00:25:00	Standard protocol.
449	00:25:02	00:25:05	sodas first, mixers second, beers last. No exceptions.
450	00:25:05	00:25:08	Where's your alcohol?
451	00:25:08	00:25:09	I don't see any bottles.
452	00:25:09	00:25:10	Back of the house.
453	00:25:11	00:25:13	Really?
454	00:25:13	00:25:16	May I order a double bourbon on the rocks?
455	00:25:16	00:25:17	Coming up.
456	00:25:36	00:25:37	Eight dollars.
457	00:25:38	00:25:42	You keep the drink and the change. Thank you.
458	00:25:42	00:25:44	You mind if I take a look in your purse?
459	00:25:44	00:25:45	Yes, I do mind.
460	00:25:50	00:25:51	I'll tell you this.
461	00:25:51	00:25:54	You bust me...
462	00:25:54	00:25:56	you better bust all of us.
463	00:26:04	00:26:10	No glass no paint flecks, no personal effects.
464	00:26:10	00:26:11	It's been cleaned.
465	00:26:12	00:26:13	Hold the phone.
466	00:26:15	00:26:17	I've got what looks like...
467	00:26:17	00:26:19	Ah.
468	00:26:21	00:26:22	...a nine-millimeter round.
469	00:26:22	00:26:25	No visible body fluid. What do you think?
470	00:26:25	00:26:26	Maybe a miss?
471	00:26:26	00:26:29	Well, if he was shot in this car there's got to be some blood.
472	00:26:29	00:26:32	Spray it up.
473	00:26:42	00:26:46	Well, the only void is in the driver's seat.
474	00:26:46	00:26:48	Means it was occupied by our victim, Jace Felder.
475	00:26:48	00:26:50	So he was shot in the head, left to right.
476	00:26:50	00:26:53	Spatter on the passenger door is from the exit wound.
477	00:26:53	00:26:56	Well, what about the rest of this blood?
478	00:26:56	00:26:57	It's everywhere.
479	00:26:57	00:27:00	He was shot while the car was in motion?
480	00:27:00	00:27:02	Bled out while the car was rolling?
481	00:27:04	00:27:06	I want to meet this seller.
482	00:27:06	00:27:07	Opportunity knocked.
483	00:27:08	00:27:09	I answered.
484	00:27:09	00:27:10	Okay.
485	00:27:10	00:27:14	Uh, let's back up and start over shall we, Mr. Masters?
486	00:27:14	00:27:16	You and your brother were off-roading.
487	00:27:16	00:27:17	Yes, sir.
488	00:27:17	00:27:20	And you stumbled upon a wrecked racer out near Mercury.
489	00:27:20	00:27:21	Yes, sir.
490	00:27:22	00:27:23	Why didn't you just...?
491	00:27:23	00:27:24	Wait a minute.
492	00:27:24	00:27:26	Let me, uh, let me get in on this.
493	00:27:26	00:27:27	Please.
494	00:27:27	00:27:28	What were you thinking?
495	00:27:28	00:27:30	You-you took the car?
496	00:27:30	00:27:31	Damn right.
497	00:27:31	00:27:33	Engine alone's worth 15 grand.
498	00:27:34	00:27:36	The keys are still in the ignition. See if it runs.
499	00:27:36	00:27:38	What about him?
500	00:27:38	00:27:39	L-Leave him here.
501	00:27:39	00:27:43	And what does a person's life go for?
502	00:27:43	00:27:45	Ma'am, he was already dead.
503	00:27:45	00:27:47	I drove the car home, washed it out.
504	00:27:47	00:27:50	And you didn't think to call 911 or anything like that?
505	00:27:50	00:27:53	No. You guys would have impounded the car.
506	00:27:53	00:27:55	Okay, Mr. Masters.
507	00:27:55	00:27:57	You've just confessed to grand larceny.
508	00:27:57	00:27:59	Tampering with a crime scene.
509	00:27:59	00:28:01	Detective Lockwood will get back to you on the murder charge.
510	00:28:06	00:28:08	Make yourself at home, boss.
511	00:28:10	00:28:11	Jackass.
512	00:28:11	00:28:12	Dumbass.
513	00:28:13	00:28:14	Opportunity knocked.
514	00:28:14	00:28:15	Hey, guys.
515	00:28:15	00:28:17	I got a name on that third-party check signed over to Michelangelo.
516	00:28:18	00:28:20	Tony Del Nagro. 8824 Sandy Creek Road.
517	00:28:21	00:28:23	Yeah. I race.
518	00:28:23	00:28:25	You race Jace Felder the other night?
519	00:28:25	00:28:26	I race a lot of people.
520	00:28:26	00:28:31	Look, if you're looking to bust my son for street-racing you can get your partner out of my backyard. I mean...
521	00:28:31	00:28:32	Sir, we're investigating a murder.
522	00:28:32	00:28:33	Jace Felder was shot and killed.
523	00:28:33	00:28:36	He doesn't know anything about that.
524	00:28:36	00:28:38	Tony...
525	00:28:38	00:28:40	tell me about the race.
526	00:28:40	00:28:42	We went head up.
527	00:28:46	00:28:48	Put my pink slip up against his five grand.
528	00:28:48	00:28:50	Guess you could say I won.
529	00:28:58	00:29:03	This looks new-- light glass, tinted glass.
530	00:29:16	00:29:20	From what I hear, Jace Felder was...
531	00:29:20	00:29:21	Mario Andretti.
532	00:29:21	00:29:22	Why would you...?
533	00:29:26	00:29:30	Why would you risk your Michelangelo against the best?
534	00:29:30	00:29:31	The best?
535	00:29:31	00:29:34	Yeah, right.
536	00:29:34	00:29:37	Jace was nothing but a lip-flapper.
537	00:29:37	00:29:40	Told me I was all flash and no dash.
538	00:29:40	00:29:42	He wanted to nut up a title. I took it.
539	00:29:50	00:29:51	Everybody scattered.
540	00:29:51	00:29:54	No one wants to be there when the cops show up.
541	00:29:54	00:29:57	Did you replace one of your car windows recently?
542	00:29:57	00:29:58	Yeah.
543	00:29:58	00:29:59	Last week.
544	00:29:59	00:30:02	Some tweeker blew it out doing donuts.
545	00:30:02	00:30:04	Before or after you fired the gun in your car?
546	00:30:04	00:30:07	All right what is this all about?
547	00:30:07	00:30:09	I mean, look, my son doesn't have to answer any more of your questions.
548	00:30:10	00:30:11	Dad, it's okay.
549	00:30:11	00:30:12	It's fine.
550	00:30:15	00:30:18	Yeah, I popped off a few rounds through the sunroof.
551	00:30:18	00:30:20	The sunroof?
552	00:30:20	00:30:21	Yeah, everybody does it.
553	00:30:21	00:30:24	Music's bumpin' and everybody's showing off their wheels.
554	00:30:24	00:30:25	You get hyped for a race.
555	00:30:25	00:30:26	Everybody does it.
556	00:30:26	00:30:27	Where's the gun, Tony?
557	00:30:27	00:30:30	It's not his; it's mine.
558	00:30:31	00:30:32	It doesn't belong to him.
559	00:30:32	00:30:34	It's registered to me.
560	00:30:34	00:30:36	Well, sir, we have reason to believe this gun was used in a homicide.
561	00:30:36	00:30:39	Well, sir...
562	00:30:39	00:30:51	my wife was murdered two years ago and I couldn't even get a cop to return my phone calls and now here you are in my home harassing my son.
563	00:30:52	00:30:54	Get out.
564	00:30:54	00:30:56	Now. Take a walk.
565	00:30:59	00:31:01	We'll be back with a warrant.
566	00:31:08	00:31:09	What do cowboys drink?
567	00:31:09	00:31:10	Whiskey.
568	00:31:10	00:31:12	And when I chew on a lemon wedge boy, is it...
569	00:31:12	00:31:14	Sour.
570	00:31:14	00:31:16	And vacuums are great because they... suck.
571	00:31:16	00:31:18	Reverse suction.
572	00:31:22	00:31:27	His drink in her eyedrops; her eyedrops in his drinks.
573	00:31:27	00:31:29	Dr. Edmund Locard would be proud.
574	00:31:29	00:31:32	Well, we got a bonded bartender eye in the sky, other waitresses.
575	00:31:32	00:31:36	How the hell did she get that into his drink without anyone seeing?
576	00:31:36	00:31:38	Aye. There's the rub.
577	00:32:12	00:32:13	What do you got?
578	00:32:13	00:32:16	Suspicious waitress.
579	00:32:16	00:32:21	Standard protocol for ordering drinks-- the sodas, then mixed drinks, then beers.
580	00:32:21	00:32:24	First five rounds, she ordered correctly.
581	00:32:24	00:32:29	The last round, however she ordered Doyle's whiskey sour first.
582	00:32:29	00:32:30	You can't pin this on me.
583	00:32:30	00:32:32	Sure, we can.
584	00:32:32	00:32:35	You put your eyedrops in Doyle Pfeiffer's drink.
585	00:32:35	00:32:36	That's what killed him.
586	00:32:36	00:32:38	My eyedrops?
587	00:32:38	00:32:40	Look, you saw the way it works.
588	00:32:40	00:32:41	I didn't have time.
589	00:32:41	00:32:42	You made the time.
590	00:32:42	00:32:44	Whiskey sour, decaf, bottled water, beer.
591	00:32:44	00:32:46	Come on, Nadine. Order your drinks in the right order, okay?
592	00:32:46	00:32:48	I'm swamped. Just give them to me. I am, too.
593	00:32:52	00:32:57	You changed the order of your drinks and the switch-up gave you...
594	00:32:57	00:32:59	opportunity.
595	00:32:59	00:33:01	So, let's talk motive.
596	00:33:01	00:33:02	You want motive?
597	00:33:02	00:33:03	Yes.
598	00:33:03	00:33:04	He was a stiff.
599	00:33:05	00:33:07	I gave him a standard eyedrop shooter.
600	00:33:07	00:33:09	I was trying to give the guy diarrhea, not kill him.
601	00:33:09	00:33:15	Doyle sat at my table night after night and never so much as even tosses me one of those piddly-ass candies of his?
602	00:33:17	00:33:19	the Georges and the stiffs.
603	00:33:19	00:33:21	Matt was a George; Doyle was a stiff.
604	00:33:21	00:33:26	Now, if you want to charge me with conspiracy of trying to make a guy crap his pants then fine, go ahead.
605	00:33:26	00:33:27	I'm guilty.
606	00:33:27	00:33:30	But I didn't kill him.
607	00:33:30	00:33:33	So, the kid gets the pot but he doesn't get the reputation.
608	00:33:33	00:33:35	Server's revenge.
609	00:33:35	00:33:36	Yeah, that's what she said.
610	00:33:36	00:33:39	A pissed-off waitress and a rounder with a bullet in him it could be a lethal combination.
611	00:33:39	00:33:42	Got that tox report back.
612	00:33:47	00:33:50	Basophillic stippling?
613	00:33:50	00:33:51	Well, that can't be.
614	00:33:51	00:33:54	Coarse basophillic stippling only occurs from massive infusions of lead.
615	00:33:54	00:33:59	Yeah, and according to the tox report the bullet in his leg wasn't degraded enough to account for the amount of lead in his body.
616	00:33:59	00:34:01	So where'd the rest of the lead come from?
617	00:34:04	00:34:05	What do you got, Bobby?
618	00:34:05	00:34:07	Yo, got your bullet.
619	00:34:07	00:34:08	She pulled this out of a CRX, huh?
620	00:34:08	00:34:09	Yeah.
621	00:34:09	00:34:11	Well, it's a lead core of a bullet.
622	00:34:11	00:34:12	Looks like a...
623	00:34:12	00:34:14	medium caliber, just mangled upon impact.
624	00:34:14	00:34:16	Can't get any stria, so, uh...
625	00:34:16	00:34:18	test firing the suspect's weapon's a waste of time.
626	00:34:18	00:34:19	Great, so it's useless.
627	00:34:19	00:34:20	Well, I don't know.
628	00:34:20	00:34:21	Take a look at the tip there.
629	00:34:22	00:34:25	Bullet's got splinters.
630	00:34:25	00:34:29	Light glass, tinted glass.
631	00:34:29	00:34:30	Thanks, Bobby.
632	00:34:30	00:34:31	Yeah, sure thing.
633	00:34:31	00:34:33	Okay, the last hand.
634	00:34:33	00:34:36	I'm Doyle, I've been sitting in the same chair for 13 hours.
635	00:34:36	00:34:38	Here comes the cocktail waitress.
636	00:34:38	00:34:39	She serves me my drink.
637	00:34:39	00:34:43	Flashes me then she looks at Matt.
638	00:34:43	00:34:45	Question is, why?
639	00:34:45	00:34:49	Let's not forget the eyedrops are already in the drink; maybe she's giving him a signal.
640	00:34:49	00:34:50	Yeah, maybe they're working together.
641	00:34:50	00:34:52	It's irrelevant. We've been chasing eyedrops to death.
642	00:34:52	00:34:54	We're looking for lead.
643	00:34:54	00:34:56	Well, maybe the lead came from the glasses.
644	00:34:56	00:34:57	Lead crystal.
645	00:34:57	00:34:59	Yeah, in a casino? Picture that.
646	00:34:59	00:35:01	Already tested them. Negative.
647	00:35:07	00:35:10	So, I looked into Rita Del Nagro's death.
648	00:35:10	00:35:12	The accident report says hit-and-run.
649	00:35:12	00:35:14	It was a two-car collision. It's still open.
650	00:35:14	00:35:18	An arrest was made, but the suspect was released due to insufficient evidence.
651	00:35:18	00:35:20	Now, guess his name.
652	00:35:20	00:35:21	Jace Felder?
653	00:35:21	00:35:25	Gives Tony Del Nagro plenty of motive.
654	00:35:25	00:35:26	He lost his mother.
655	00:35:26	00:35:27	Wanted revenge.
656	00:35:27	00:35:30	Maybe, but why try to gun down Felder in the middle of a street race?
657	00:35:30	00:35:33	Well, if it looks like an accident the investigation would be abbreviated.
658	00:35:33	00:35:34	All right, stand back, y'all.
659	00:35:35	00:35:38	No full-on autopsy the bullet could go undetected.
660	00:35:40	00:35:41	Firing!
661	00:35:48	00:35:51	Bullet's nose picked up trace of both windows.
662	00:35:51	00:35:54	Just like the one recovered from Jace Felder's car.
663	00:35:54	00:35:55	You guys rock.
664	00:35:56	00:35:58	So, we know the bullet can make the shot...
665	00:36:00	00:36:02	let's go see if the driver can.
666	00:36:07	00:36:10	Hey, thanks, we'll take care of them for you.
667	00:36:10	00:36:11	Hey, wait, hang on.
668	00:36:11	00:36:13	Cath, give me a test fire, will you?
669	00:36:13	00:36:15	Love to.
670	00:36:21	00:36:24	I wired the target to the car's alarm system.
671	00:36:24	00:36:26	Gotta make sure we hear it.
672	00:36:26	00:36:29	Always thinking there, Nicky, aren't ya?
673	00:36:33	00:36:38	Okay, remember full out the fifth then hit the nitrous and hang on.
674	00:36:38	00:36:40	You just try to keep up.
675	00:37:31	00:37:34	Thank you. Good night!
676	00:38:26	00:38:29	Jace killed my mom.
677	00:38:29	00:38:31	Everybody knew it.
678	00:38:31	00:38:33	Everybody knew it, and nobody came forward.
679	00:38:34	00:38:37	It was a street race.
680	00:38:42	00:38:45	Jace's car just slammed right into us.
681	00:38:47	00:38:50	Killed my mom instantly.
682	00:38:50	00:38:52	He just plowed right into us.
683	00:38:52	00:38:54	Kept going.
684	00:38:55	00:38:56	You were in the car.
685	00:38:57	00:38:59	Why didn't you just tell the police?
686	00:38:59	00:39:03	Because I didn't know it was Jace.
687	00:39:03	00:39:07	I found out later on that it was a street racer.
688	00:39:07	00:39:09	And you weren't?
689	00:39:09	00:39:11	Not at the time, no.
690	00:39:11	00:39:17	So I went to a couple of events and hooked into the world.
691	00:39:17	00:39:22	I found out within one hour who killed her.
692	00:39:22	00:39:27	So, let me get this straight.
693	00:39:27	00:39:31	You decide to become one of them.
694	00:39:31	00:39:38	You buy a car with your mother's death benefit toss your hat in the ring and wait for your shot.
695	00:39:42	00:39:46	Revenge is best served cold.
696	00:39:57	00:40:01	I never stopped.
697	00:40:01	00:40:04	I just kept going.
698	00:40:04	00:40:06	Never looked back.
699	00:40:06	00:40:08	Took his title and then took him down.
700	00:40:08	00:40:14	He took my mother's life so I took his.
701	00:40:17	00:40:18	What's up, Griss?
702	00:40:19	00:40:23	Did you guys know that 70% of the world's chocolate is produced in West Africa?
703	00:40:23	00:40:24	Really? Yeah.
704	00:40:24	00:40:28	The Ivory Coast Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon.
705	00:40:28	00:40:30	No, I, uh, didn't know that.
706	00:40:30	00:40:31	Doyle Pfeiffer didn't know either.
707	00:40:31	00:40:37	Chocolate comes from cocoa plants but in West Africa the cars still use leaded gas.
708	00:40:37	00:40:41	So when the exhaust fumes disperse into the atmosphere...
709	00:40:42	00:40:47	and it rains... it pours lead.
710	00:40:47	00:40:48	Like acid rain.
711	00:40:48	00:40:53	Whatever's in the atmosphere gets into the soil gets into the cocoa plants.
712	00:40:53	00:40:55	Capillary action.
713	00:40:55	00:41:00	Then the cocoa's harvested, processed, refined sold into bulk, and eventually...
714	00:41:00	00:41:02	Choco-bees.
715	00:41:04	00:41:06	Doyle Pfeiffer's nickname was the Candyman.
716	00:41:06	00:41:10	He got that name the night he won the world championship in '86.
717	00:41:10	00:41:13	Well, if he had those chocolates with him in '86 he's had them every night since.
718	00:41:13	00:41:14	His lucky charm.
719	00:41:14	00:41:19	By my calculations he might have consumed up to a pound of chocolate a night for 16 years.
720	00:41:19	00:41:20	Wow.
721	00:41:20	00:41:22	That would explain all the lead in him.
722	00:41:22	00:41:27	Ultimately the tetrahydrosoline in the eyedrops triggered it, but essentially, it was...
723	00:41:27	00:41:30	death by chocolate.
