0	00:00:02	00:00:03	May I see your discoloration?
1	00:00:03	00:00:05	You want to give me 20 bucks?
2	00:00:05	00:00:06	You want to do time?
3	00:00:09	00:00:11	You know what? I got to be somewhere.
4	00:00:11	00:00:12	Can you handle this from here? Yeah.
5	00:00:12	00:00:18	Warrick Brown had one of my guys sub for him in court, but I have it on good authority that he was gambling.
6	00:00:18	00:00:21	I need you to do some background for me on Warrick.
7	00:00:21	00:00:22	Warrick? Your favorite CSI.
8	00:00:22	00:00:26	That’s why I want you to handle it, so that Ecklie can’t accuse me of favoritism.
9	00:00:26	00:00:28	I got this surveillance tape.
10	00:00:28	00:00:30	He was in a casino. I’m sorry.
11	00:00:51	00:00:53	Manager to register two, please.
12	00:00:53	00:00:55	Manager to register two.
13	00:01:33	00:01:35	Well, if it isn’t The Boss himself!
14	00:01:35	00:01:37	Where’s your E-Street Band?
15	00:01:37	00:01:39	They had another gig.
16	00:01:39	00:01:40	How you doing, Jim?
17	00:01:40	00:01:41	How’s your new old job?
18	00:01:41	00:01:44	Ah, I can sling scum all day long. You?
19	00:01:44	00:01:46	I curse more.
20	00:01:46	00:01:47	Oh, yeah?
21	00:01:47	00:01:48	Well, wait.
22	00:01:48	00:01:50	The shopping cart’s over here.
23	00:01:50	00:01:52	The missing woman is Margaret Shorey.
24	00:01:52	00:01:53	Lives with her sister.
25	00:01:53	00:01:56	Went out to get groceries; never came home.
26	00:01:56	00:01:58	Car is still in the parking lot.
27	00:01:58	00:01:59	And her purse is still in the cart.
28	00:02:07	00:02:08	With no wallet.
29	00:02:08	00:02:10	Maybe she left the purse as a marker.
30	00:02:12	00:02:14	Chicken soup, ice packs...
31	00:02:14	00:02:16	pain reliever...
32	00:02:16	00:02:19	Sister broke her wrist in a car wreck.
33	00:02:19	00:02:20	Hot dogs, hot dog buns...
34	00:02:20	00:02:22	Junk-food junkie.
35	00:02:30	00:02:34	Oh, that’s sanitary.
36	00:02:34	00:02:35	Mustard.
37	00:02:39	00:02:41	Did you have any mop-ups in this aisle today?
38	00:02:41	00:02:44	Yeah. Yeah, as a matter of fact, we did.
39	00:02:44	00:02:45	Life holds no surprises.
40	00:02:51	00:02:55	$1.98 for the mustard... plus my two cents.
41	00:02:58	00:03:00	What are you doing?
42	00:03:00	00:03:02	Now, where would you go?
43	00:03:14	00:03:16	Oh, man.
44	00:03:16	00:03:18	Hey, Brass, look at this.
45	00:03:18	00:03:19	What?
46	00:03:19	00:03:21	You see this?
47	00:03:21	00:03:24	See what?
48	00:03:24	00:03:25	This circumference?
49	00:03:25	00:03:28	Looks like somebody did a Brillo job on it.
50	00:03:28	00:03:31	All I see is a clean door.
51	00:03:31	00:03:32	You know anything about this?
52	00:03:32	00:03:34	Yeah, he’s right-- we cleaned it up today.
53	00:03:34	00:03:35	I had a complaint.
54	00:03:35	00:03:38	Kids are always writing crazy stuff on bathroom doors.
55	00:03:38	00:03:41	So I had one of my employees scrub it off.
56	00:03:41	00:03:42	Could I borrow a hammer?
57	00:04:16	00:04:22	I’ve killed 5 women. Catch me if you can?
58	00:05:24	00:05:25	Hi, kids. Hi.
59	00:05:25	00:05:27	Sara Sidle. 419.
60	00:05:27	00:05:29	Dead body--bonus.
61	00:05:29	00:05:30	Oh, somebody likes her job.
62	00:05:30	00:05:33	Nick Stokes--416, fight at the Bellagio.
63	00:05:33	00:05:34	She says she’s a friend of yours.
64	00:05:34	00:05:36	Ex-girlfriend, Nick?
65	00:05:36	00:05:37	Well, that depends.
66	00:05:37	00:05:39	Was she the assaulter or the assaultee?
67	00:05:39	00:05:41	You tell us--you like leather or lace?
68	00:05:41	00:05:44	No, I’m not even going there.
69	00:05:44	00:05:45	Lace.
70	00:05:45	00:05:48	Catherine, you have a 418-- an obituary on a stall door.
71	00:05:48	00:05:51	I’ll meet you in the garage but first, I’ve got to take care of Warrick.
72	00:05:51	00:05:53	Oh, no. What are you going to do?
73	00:05:53	00:05:55	I don’t know.
74	00:05:58	00:06:01	I filed my report.
75	00:06:01	00:06:02	I read it.
76	00:06:19	00:06:20	Hey.
77	00:06:20	00:06:22	Hey.
78	00:06:22	00:06:26	I missed assignments; I know.
79	00:06:26	00:06:28	I’m running late.
80	00:06:28	00:06:29	What did I pull?
81	00:06:29	00:06:30	How was court the other day?
82	00:06:30	00:06:34	I handed it off to Michovitch, from Daze.
83	00:06:34	00:06:35	Uh, I told Sara.
84	00:06:35	00:06:40	Yeah, because you had, uh, personal business.
85	00:06:40	00:06:43	Yeah.
86	00:06:43	00:06:44	What’s that?
87	00:06:44	00:06:45	You...
88	00:06:45	00:06:47	at the Monaco Casino.
89	00:06:47	00:06:48	What?
90	00:06:48	00:06:49	I don’t believe this.
91	00:06:49	00:06:51	Now you’re pulling up film on me?
92	00:06:51	00:06:56	Casinos tape everyone who walks through their door, Warrick, you know that.
93	00:06:56	00:06:58	I thought we had a deal.
94	00:06:58	00:06:59	We do.
95	00:06:59	00:07:02	Look, what you do on your time is nobody’s business.
96	00:07:02	00:07:05	What you do on my time is my business.
97	00:07:13	00:07:16	I was at the casino.
98	00:07:16	00:07:18	But I wasn’t gambling.
99	00:07:36	00:07:38	Get me a picture of the body...
100	00:07:38	00:07:40	the items on the bedsheet...
101	00:07:40	00:07:44	the window, the drafting table.
102	00:07:45	00:07:47	Everything on the floor.
103	00:07:53	00:07:55	Sara Sidle, Crime Scene Investigation.
104	00:07:55	00:07:57	And you are...?
105	00:07:57	00:07:58	I’m... Kenny Berlin.
106	00:07:58	00:07:59	That’s my brother.
107	00:07:59	00:08:01	I’m the one who found him.
108	00:08:01	00:08:02	Sorry for your loss.
109	00:08:02	00:08:04	You want to tell me what happened here?
110	00:08:04	00:08:06	I don’t... I don’t know.
111	00:08:06	00:08:12	I came...I came walking in the door, I saw my brother lying there...
112	00:08:12	00:08:13	stuff everywhere.
113	00:08:13	00:08:15	All I could think was that...
114	00:08:27	00:08:29	Hey!
115	00:08:33	00:08:34	Hey, Jeff.
116	00:08:46	00:08:52	I-I called 9-1-1 and then you guys showed up, and...
117	00:08:52	00:08:54	Thank you.
118	00:08:54	00:08:57	There have been several burglaries in the neighborhood; all benign.
119	00:08:57	00:09:00	Nothing benign about two $20s screaming, take me on the bar.
120	00:09:00	00:09:02	Maybe he missed it?
121	00:09:02	00:09:05	Yeah, well, it’s hard to miss all that high-tech computer equipment.
122	00:09:05	00:09:06	There’s got to be five, ten grand there.
123	00:09:06	00:09:07	First thing I’d take.
124	00:09:07	00:09:09	He was interrupted.
125	00:09:09	00:09:13	Before or after he used a bedsheet to transport the silverware?
126	00:09:13	00:09:15	Pillowcases are the norm, you know that.
127	00:09:17	00:09:19	Something’s not right.
128	00:09:32	00:09:33	Gentlemen, Nick Stokes.
129	00:09:33	00:09:36	I’m here for the 416; something about a special request.
130	00:09:36	00:09:37	Don’t ask me.
131	00:09:37	00:09:39	Go ask Catherine Zeta Jones over there.
132	00:09:39	00:09:41	Over where?
133	00:09:41	00:09:43	Thanks.
134	00:09:45	00:09:46	Excuse me... ma’am?
135	00:09:48	00:09:49	Oh, Nick, hey...
136	00:09:49	00:09:50	You got to be kidding me.
137	00:09:50	00:09:54	Oh, you probably don’t recognize me with the shorter hair.
138	00:09:54	00:09:55	My nipples are all better, you want to see?
139	00:09:55	00:09:57	Yeah, yeah, Kristy Hopkins, what are you doing here?
140	00:09:57	00:09:59	I’ll tell you what she’s doing here--she’s cruising.
141	00:09:59	00:10:04	No, I’m in here, minding my own business shopping for a dress, spending my hard- earned money!
142	00:10:04	00:10:06	Okay, semi-hard- earned money.
143	00:10:06	00:10:11	When Squiggy over here starts harassing me saying he doesn’t want my type in here.
144	00:10:11	00:10:15	He grabs my arm, cops a feel, then he spit on me, so I slugged him!
145	00:10:15	00:10:17	Whoa, whoa, whoa... he spit on you?
146	00:10:17	00:10:19	Wait, you’re not listening to this?
147	00:10:19	00:10:20	This is such a crock. Oh, I’ll show you...
148	00:10:20	00:10:22	All right, all right, break it up, break it up!
149	00:10:22	00:10:23	Ease up! Ease up! Ease up!
150	00:10:23	00:10:24	Hey, I’m pressing charges!
151	00:10:24	00:10:26	I don’t care who you know!
152	00:10:26	00:10:27	Kristy! What?
153	00:10:27	00:10:29	It’s all right-- I’ve got to take her in.
154	00:10:29	00:10:32	Just give me a minute, will you?
155	00:10:32	00:10:33	Get over here!
156	00:10:36	00:10:38	I need your shirt.
157	00:10:40	00:10:43	Why is it every time we meet you’re wanting me to take my clothes off?
158	00:10:43	00:10:49	Because every time we meet, you put yourself in a position where you have to take them off.
159	00:10:51	00:10:54	Using your arms-- how big’s a whale?
160	00:10:56	00:10:57	Now freeze, don’t move.
161	00:10:57	00:10:59	Up.
162	00:10:59	00:11:00	What are you doing?
163	00:11:00	00:11:02	Checking for blood spatter.
164	00:11:02	00:11:04	What blood? Am I a suspect?
165	00:11:04	00:11:06	This is what I do.
166	00:11:06	00:11:08	This is how I eliminate you as a suspect.
167	00:11:19	00:11:21	I’ll take that for you.
168	00:11:27	00:11:31	Well, that’s good news; no blood, bud.
169	00:11:40	00:11:42	I am gonna need you to strip, though.
170	00:11:42	00:11:44	Right here?
171	00:11:44	00:11:45	Don’t be shy on my account.
172	00:11:45	00:11:50	But if you are, this nice detective will accompany you to the bedroom.
173	00:11:50	00:11:54	Oh, and, uh, I’m going to need to take your window with me too.
174	00:11:54	00:11:57	It’s all in the warrant.
175	00:12:00	00:12:03	The person who wrote this is left-handed.
176	00:12:03	00:12:05	And we know that because...?
177	00:12:05	00:12:08	The t-bar in catch, it’s left-tending.
178	00:12:08	00:12:10	And uneducated...
179	00:12:10	00:12:13	The contraction in Iv’e is misplaced.
180	00:12:13	00:12:18	Then we have the large, arched hood in the letter Y and the arches in the bottom of the Ls.
181	00:12:18	00:12:26	This indicates criminal tendency, which is supported by the heavy pastiosity, which suggests low impulse control.
182	00:12:26	00:12:27	Heavy pastiosity?
183	00:12:27	00:12:31	The pressure-- how firmly you put pen to paper.
184	00:12:31	00:12:32	Or marker to metal.
185	00:12:34	00:12:36	Do we know anything else?
186	00:12:36	00:12:37	Yes.
187	00:12:37	00:12:42	Overall, the handwriting is cursive and round.
188	00:12:42	00:12:44	This tells me it was written by a woman.
189	00:13:00	00:13:02	Damn!
190	00:13:02	00:13:06	Taking the whole window.
191	00:13:06	00:13:10	Grissom reinstated you.
192	00:13:10	00:13:11	And you have a problem with that.
193	00:13:11	00:13:13	Let me guess.
194	00:13:13	00:13:16	Grissom gets you to dime yourself off and now you both feel better?
195	00:13:16	00:13:17	You’re supposed to be in court.
196	00:13:17	00:13:21	Instead, you’re placing bets for a cheap thrill to satisfy nothing.
197	00:13:21	00:13:24	Hey! This has nothing to do with you.
198	00:13:27	00:13:29	So are we going to work together?
199	00:13:29	00:13:30	Or not?
200	00:13:30	00:13:32	I’m already working.
201	00:13:50	00:13:53	You weren’t in your office.
202	00:13:53	00:13:55	And good morning to you too, Miss Sidle.
203	00:13:55	00:13:57	Warrick has a problem.
204	00:13:57	00:13:59	Ignoring it isn’t gonna make it go away.
205	00:13:59	00:14:03	You asked me for a report and then you disregard my recommendation.
206	00:14:03	00:14:05	I read your report.
207	00:14:05	00:14:08	So you feel comfortable jeopardizing a unit to placate an addict?
208	00:14:08	00:14:11	I see the whole puzzle, Sara.
209	00:14:11	00:14:12	You’re only seeing one piece.
210	00:14:12	00:14:16	Then at least take him off my case.
211	00:14:16	00:14:17	No.
212	00:14:17	00:14:19	I trust him.
213	00:14:19	00:14:21	Do you trust me?
214	00:14:23	00:14:24	Grissom.
215	00:14:24	00:14:26	I’ve got something you want to see.
216	00:14:33	00:14:36	You know how you’re always pushing that Holy Trinity stuff?
217	00:14:36	00:14:38	Father, Son, Holy Ghost?
218	00:14:38	00:14:40	Victim, suspect, crime scene.
219	00:14:40	00:14:41	That one--oh.
220	00:14:41	00:14:42	Right. Well, we don’t have a victim.
221	00:14:42	00:14:44	We don’t have a suspect.
222	00:14:44	00:14:48	All we have is a crime scene-- the restroom at Marty’s Market with the message, I killed five women.
223	00:14:48	00:14:51	So I figured there had to be four others.
224	00:14:51	00:14:53	You found the other four victims?
225	00:14:53	00:14:56	No, I found the four other crime scenes.
226	00:14:57	00:15:00	Brass ran our case through VICAP.
227	00:15:00	00:15:02	I made a few calls.
228	00:15:08	00:15:11	Iv’e killed 1 woman. Victorville.
229	00:15:12	00:15:14	Salt Lake City-- Iv’e killed 2 women.
230	00:15:14	00:15:17	Catch me if you can?
231	00:15:17	00:15:20	San Bernardino-- Iv’e killed 3 women...
232	00:15:20	00:15:24	Iv’e killed 4 women. Catch me! Mesquite.
233	00:15:24	00:15:27	...5 women... Las Vegas.
234	00:15:27	00:15:31	Five stall doors from five supermarket restrooms.
235	00:15:31	00:15:36	Five missing women, including Margaret Shorey.
236	00:15:36	00:15:38	What else do you know about the crime scenes?
237	00:15:38	00:15:42	Just like Marty’s Market-- there was no physical evidence indicating that the women were killed there.
238	00:15:42	00:15:48	Which means they were probably alive when these messages were written, making these messages of intention, not fact.
239	00:16:09	00:16:12	What if we shuffle these doors like pai gow tiles?
240	00:16:29	00:16:31	San Bernardino, California.
241	00:16:31	00:16:32	Victorville, California.
242	00:16:32	00:16:34	Las Vegas, Nevada.
243	00:16:34	00:16:35	Mesquite, Nevada.
244	00:16:35	00:16:37	Salt Lake City, Utah.
245	00:16:40	00:16:41	Interstate 15.
246	00:16:41	00:16:44	God knows I’ve driven it enough times.
247	00:16:44	00:16:46	So has our suspect.
248	00:16:50	00:16:53	Okay, dude, it’s ready.
249	00:16:54	00:17:01	So this paper should have soaked up any foreign material on the shirt, particularly amylase...
250	00:17:06	00:17:13	You know, I’ve done this procedure on jeans and leather jackets, but never on something like this.
251	00:17:13	00:17:15	It’s very see-through.
252	00:17:15	00:17:17	Very Jennifer Lopez.
253	00:17:17	00:17:19	Down, boy.
254	00:17:19	00:17:20	What can you tell me?
255	00:17:20	00:17:21	Is there saliva on it?
256	00:17:21	00:17:23	It’s gonna be a tough one to prove.
257	00:17:23	00:17:24	This is only step one.
258	00:17:24	00:17:27	You see, when a person talks, saliva naturally comes out of their mouth.
259	00:17:27	00:17:30	Let’s say that we’re tossing the hog back and forth, right?
260	00:17:30	00:17:33	What can you tell me about the hottie that goes inside this blouse, huh?
261	00:17:33	00:17:36	Is it true she’s a friend of yours?
262	00:17:36	00:17:37	What, is it on the Internet?
263	00:17:37	00:17:39	Might as well be.
264	00:17:39	00:17:41	Just remember that.
265	00:17:41	00:17:44	My saliva’s getting on you; your saliva’s getting on me.
266	00:17:44	00:17:45	Gross.
267	00:17:49	00:17:50	What’s that stuff?
268	00:17:50	00:17:52	Starch and iodine.
269	00:17:52	00:17:58	If this is saliva, we’re gonna get the ol’ Dalmatian effect.
270	00:17:58	00:18:01	So, Nick, if I wanted to meet this friend of yours...?
271	00:18:01	00:18:03	No.
272	00:18:03	00:18:04	Figured.
273	00:18:08	00:18:09	That’s a pretty big spot.
274	00:18:09	00:18:11	That’s more than just a spray.
275	00:18:11	00:18:16	In fact, looks like a distinct glob of spit.
276	00:18:16	00:18:19	Kristy was telling the truth.
277	00:18:19	00:18:21	But it doesn’t mean it was the security guard’s spit.
278	00:18:21	00:18:23	Step three.
279	00:18:23	00:18:25	I’m going to need a sample.
280	00:18:25	00:18:28	Well, if the guy knows he did it, he’s not gonna cough it up.
281	00:18:28	00:18:32	If you saw the girl that went with this blouse...
282	00:18:32	00:18:33	you’d try.
283	00:18:35	00:18:37	You found what on my pants?
284	00:18:37	00:18:39	Glass. Any idea how it got there?
285	00:18:39	00:18:46	Well, it’s just a guess, but someone broke into my car last weekend and smashed my window and made off with my CD player.
286	00:18:46	00:18:48	So I must’ve been wearing those pants.
287	00:18:48	00:18:50	Did you file a police report?
288	00:18:50	00:18:52	No, but you can check with my insurance company.
289	00:18:52	00:18:54	I already checked with my lab.
290	00:18:54	00:18:56	They do this test, and guess what?
291	00:18:56	00:18:59	The glass--it floated.
292	00:18:59	00:19:01	You know what that means?
293	00:19:01	00:19:02	No.
294	00:19:02	00:19:09	It means the glass on your pants and the glass from your living room window have equal densities.
295	00:19:09	00:19:11	Sorry, I was never very good at science.
296	00:19:11	00:19:15	The glass didn’t come from any car window.
297	00:19:15	00:19:17	That’s science.
298	00:19:17	00:19:18	Anything else you’d like to tell us?
299	00:19:18	00:19:21	Look, it’s like I told you.
300	00:19:21	00:19:22	I walked in the house...
301	00:19:27	00:19:33	...and I thought, They’re coming back and they’re gonna kill me too.
302	00:19:33	00:19:36	I heard a noise and I walked to the window.
303	00:19:36	00:19:38	That must be when I got the glass on my pants.
304	00:19:38	00:19:42	Look, somebody really did break into my car, okay?
305	00:19:42	00:19:45	And I just remembered all that stuff just now.
306	00:19:47	00:19:50	So am I in trouble?
307	00:19:52	00:19:53	You’re free to go.
308	00:19:53	00:19:54	No, he’s not.
309	00:19:54	00:19:56	We’re not cops; we can’t hold him.
310	00:19:56	00:19:58	Just one more question.
311	00:19:58	00:20:00	What do you do for a living?
312	00:20:00	00:20:01	I’m a day trader.
313	00:20:01	00:20:05	You make a lot of money doing that?
314	00:20:05	00:20:06	That’s two questions.
315	00:20:06	00:20:09	Feel free to answer it anyway.
316	00:20:09	00:20:11	Yeah, you can.
317	00:20:14	00:20:15	But you don’t, right?
318	00:20:26	00:20:28	You showed him all your cards.
319	00:20:28	00:20:29	Sucker play.
320	00:20:29	00:20:30	I was playing him.
321	00:20:30	00:20:32	Cops ran Kenny’s financials.
322	00:20:32	00:20:33	He lost a pot in the market.
323	00:20:33	00:20:35	Had a ton of margin calls.
324	00:20:35	00:20:37	I’m surprised you didn’t tag him as a fellow gambler.
325	00:20:37	00:20:40	Oh, you just don’t let up, do you?
326	00:20:40	00:20:42	It’s a flaw.
327	00:20:42	00:20:43	I’ll flip you to see who drives.
328	00:20:43	00:20:44	Where we going?
329	00:20:44	00:20:46	Moapa.
330	00:20:46	00:20:47	What’s in Moapa?
331	00:20:47	00:20:48	Besides the I-15?
332	00:21:09	00:21:15	So my guys tell me that your guy Nick is helping a working girl at a five-star and it was quite a commotion.
333	00:21:15	00:21:16	Really?
334	00:21:16	00:21:19	Yeah, and if I know, it means a lot of other people know.
335	00:21:19	00:21:21	People bigger than you and me.
336	00:21:21	00:21:23	A kid from a crime lab doing favors for a hooker?
337	00:21:23	00:21:25	Can’t make the unit look too good, huh, boss?
338	00:21:25	00:21:27	Yeah, well, I’ll get into it.
339	00:21:27	00:21:31	You know, I bet that’s just what Nicky said.
340	00:21:31	00:21:32	You two ladies done talking?
341	00:21:32	00:21:35	It’s hot out here.
342	00:21:35	00:21:38	So, a kid over there started to take a leak.
343	00:21:38	00:21:39	Found the body.
344	00:21:45	00:21:47	Well, it’s not Margaret.
345	00:21:47	00:21:48	This one’s a blonde.
346	00:21:48	00:21:50	And blue.
347	00:21:53	00:21:54	This is bizarre.
348	00:21:54	00:21:56	The body’s cold.
349	00:21:56	00:21:57	In this heat?
350	00:21:57	00:22:03	And she’s stiff-- like a two-minute burrito that’s only been nuked for a minute.
351	00:22:03	00:22:05	Meet Joan Sims from San Bernardino, California.
352	00:22:05	00:22:07	We’ve been getting acquainted.
353	00:22:07	00:22:11	Missing woman number one-- disappeared from a supermarket restroom last July.
354	00:22:11	00:22:13	Cause of death was strangulation.
355	00:22:13	00:22:16	I found ligature marks on the wrists and the ankles.
356	00:22:16	00:22:17	That was the easy part.
357	00:22:17	00:22:19	This one’s weird.
358	00:22:19	00:22:21	Like, I-may-use-her- in-a-lecture weird.
359	00:22:21	00:22:23	Her decomp is completely backwards.
360	00:22:23	00:22:27	It’s supposed to begin on the inside, but her organs are in better shape than her skin.
361	00:22:27	00:22:30	Take a look at this.
362	00:22:30	00:22:32	I took tissue samples from her heart.
363	00:22:37	00:22:39	Looks like the planet Krypton.
364	00:22:39	00:22:41	More like Kryptonite.
365	00:22:41	00:22:43	Those are actually ice crystals, Superman.
366	00:22:43	00:22:44	You want to know why she’s blue?
367	00:22:44	00:22:46	Cold to the touch in the middle of the desert?
368	00:22:46	00:22:50	This lady was frozen, kept on ice until approximately 12 hours ago.
369	00:22:55	00:22:57	I-15?
370	00:22:57	00:23:00	Refrigerated?
371	00:23:00	00:23:06	That’s how she was transported from San Bernardino to Vegas-- in a refrigerated truck.
372	00:23:06	00:23:07	That’s our crime scene.
373	00:23:09	00:23:10	And it’s mobile.
374	00:23:15	00:23:19	Hey, Nick, I’ve been looking for you.
375	00:23:19	00:23:21	This girl you’ve been helping with the 416...?
376	00:23:21	00:23:23	She got in a fight with a security guard.
377	00:23:23	00:23:25	Is she a friend of yours?
378	00:23:25	00:23:27	Are you asking me what I think you’re asking me?
379	00:23:27	00:23:30	Are you doing anything that could compromise the unit?
380	00:23:30	00:23:31	I don’t believe this.
381	00:23:31	00:23:32	You’ve always been so cool.
382	00:23:32	00:23:34	I have to ask. It’s part of the job.
383	00:23:34	00:23:35	Sanders ratted me out, right?
384	00:23:35	00:23:36	No, Brass.
385	00:23:36	00:23:38	Do you want to talk about this?
386	00:23:38	00:23:40	I don’t think so.
387	00:23:42	00:23:44	Excuse you.
388	00:23:44	00:23:45	What’s his problem?
389	00:23:45	00:23:46	Me, I guess.
390	00:23:46	00:23:48	Did you find out anything?
391	00:23:48	00:23:53	Brass got us a listing of all the refrigerated trucks that made deliveries to the market yesterday.
392	00:23:53	00:23:55	There’s a female trucker on it.
393	00:24:03	00:24:05	Not bad.
394	00:24:06	00:24:09	I’m impressed.
395	00:24:09	00:24:12	Yeah, I passed up a chance to play semi-pro ball.
396	00:24:12	00:24:16	Went to college instead.
397	00:24:16	00:24:17	I meant the Haeckel marks.
398	00:24:17	00:24:20	They should tell us what we need to know.
399	00:24:25	00:24:28	This is the glass you line-drived.
400	00:24:28	00:24:30	That’s the glass you sawzalled.
401	00:24:32	00:24:34	Right angles face the same direction.
402	00:24:34	00:24:36	Take a look.
403	00:24:36	00:24:38	Oh, now I’m worthy?
404	00:24:38	00:24:41	Just take a damn look.
405	00:24:44	00:24:45	That’s crazy.
406	00:24:45	00:24:47	I loved my brother.
407	00:24:47	00:24:51	Maybe you did, maybe you didn’t, but we think you murdered him.
408	00:24:51	00:24:53	Based on what?
409	00:24:53	00:24:55	The evidence.
410	00:24:55	00:24:57	What evidence?
411	00:24:57	00:25:00	You ever heard of Haeckel marks?
412	00:25:00	00:25:01	No.
413	00:25:01	00:25:10	When a window is broken from the outside, which is what a burglar would do, Haeckel marks form right angles to the inside of the window.
414	00:25:10	00:25:20	But when a window is broken from the inside, which is what a peckerwood like you would do, Haeckel marks form right angles to the outside of a window.
415	00:25:24	00:25:28	What did you use to break the window, Kenny?
416	00:25:28	00:25:30	I didn’t use anything.
417	00:25:31	00:25:33	I didn’t do it.
418	00:25:37	00:25:39	I want a lawyer.
419	00:25:47	00:25:49	Well, we know he did it.
420	00:25:49	00:25:50	We can’t prove it, but we’ve got a motive.
421	00:25:50	00:25:52	He needed the money.
422	00:25:52	00:25:54	Okay, let’s say killing his brother would get it for him.
423	00:25:54	00:25:57	We’re back to how do we prove it.
424	00:25:57	00:25:59	He’s a day trader-- spends all day on his computer.
425	00:25:59	00:26:02	If we want to know more about him, that’s where we should be looking.
426	00:26:02	00:26:04	And his computer is...? Still at the house.
427	00:26:04	00:26:07	Still at the house? Well, we got probable cause.
428	00:26:07	00:26:09	Why don’t we go get a...?
429	00:26:09	00:26:10	Why don’t you go get a new warrant?
430	00:26:24	00:26:27	That’s my Big Mouth Billy Bass.
431	00:26:27	00:26:28	It’s better than a watchdog.
432	00:26:28	00:26:32	I’ve got valuable stuff in here, you know.
433	00:26:37	00:26:40	Yeah, I bet there are a lot of people looking to steal your two-headed scorpion.
434	00:26:40	00:26:43	Not to mention Miss Piggy.
435	00:26:46	00:26:49	I was out of line earlier.
436	00:26:49	00:26:51	I’m not sleeping with her, if it helps any.
437	00:26:51	00:26:52	It does.
438	00:26:52	00:26:55	And for the record, she wasn’t working, she was shopping.
439	00:26:55	00:26:57	And the security guard was a jerk, man.
440	00:26:57	00:26:59	He pushed her around, then he spit on her.
441	00:26:59	00:27:00	That’s why she lost it.
442	00:27:00	00:27:02	That sounds pretty straightforward.
443	00:27:02	00:27:04	Why don’t you put a rookie on it?
444	00:27:04	00:27:06	No, I can’t.
445	00:27:06	00:27:07	There’s something about her.
446	00:27:07	00:27:12	Just looking at her-- she doesn’t have anybody else.
447	00:27:12	00:27:14	I had Sanders run a test on the shirt.
448	00:27:14	00:27:17	There’s saliva on it, but the problem is, I can’t get a match.
449	00:27:17	00:27:21	The security guard refuses to give me a sample.
450	00:27:21	00:27:24	If Mohammed won’t go to the mountain, then the mountain must go to Mohammed.
451	00:27:26	00:27:27	Think about it.
452	00:27:29	00:27:31	Black, no sugar.
453	00:27:31	00:27:33	Yeah, thanks.
454	00:27:33	00:27:37	Like I said on the phone, I don’t want to seem biased here.
455	00:27:37	00:27:38	This girl’s nothing to me.
456	00:27:38	00:27:39	She’s a hooker.
457	00:27:39	00:27:41	Yeah, but you do know her.
458	00:27:41	00:27:43	Yeah, professionally.
459	00:27:43	00:27:45	My profession, not hers.
460	00:27:45	00:27:48	I cut her some slack a while back.
461	00:27:48	00:27:50	She’s bad news, but she’s a babe.
462	00:27:50	00:27:51	Tell me about it.
463	00:27:51	00:27:55	Yeah, between you and me, I should have busted her, but I thought I might get lucky.
464	00:27:55	00:27:57	Yeah.
465	00:27:57	00:28:00	Well, next time she gets in a jam, she throws my name out.
466	00:28:00	00:28:02	My boss--not pleased.
467	00:28:02	00:28:03	So...
468	00:28:05	00:28:07	Tell me what you think.
469	00:28:07	00:28:13	I want you to write down your own statement, seal it up in this envelope, and I’ll hand-deliver it to the D.A.
470	00:28:13	00:28:15	It’ll be good for both of us.
471	00:28:15	00:28:17	Yeah. Thanks, man.
472	00:28:17	00:28:18	No problem.
473	00:28:18	00:28:20	Us guys have got to stick together, right?
474	00:28:20	00:28:22	That’s right. Yeah. That’s right.
475	00:28:43	00:28:46	Of course I graduated high school.
476	00:28:46	00:28:50	Hey, if this is gonna take forever, I could lay a urine sample on you too, gratis.
477	00:28:50	00:28:52	A writing sample would be sufficient, thank you.
478	00:28:52	00:28:56	What’s that gonna tell you-- whether I was writing under the influence?
479	00:28:56	00:28:58	Do yourself a favor.
480	00:28:58	00:29:00	Yes, ma’am.
481	00:29:00	00:29:02	Now, what is it that you want me to write?
482	00:29:02	00:29:04	I’ve got a kite.
483	00:29:04	00:29:06	Can you see the women?
484	00:29:06	00:29:07	Kill the lights.
485	00:29:07	00:29:08	That’s what you want me to write?
486	00:29:08	00:29:10	Three times.
487	00:29:17	00:29:21	Caucasian female with only a high school education and left-handed.
488	00:29:27	00:29:29	You can keep the pen as a souvenir.
489	00:29:33	00:29:35	I’ll be right back.
490	00:29:35	00:29:37	Hey, come on! You’re making me late.
491	00:29:37	00:29:39	Hey, hey, hey.
492	00:29:39	00:29:40	Two cheeks on the car.
493	00:29:40	00:29:42	There you go.
494	00:30:06	00:30:08	Okay, thanks.
495	00:30:10	00:30:12	She’s not the one.
496	00:30:12	00:30:13	So did I win something?
497	00:30:13	00:30:15	The right to keep on trucking.
498	00:30:17	00:30:18	Here you go, bubba.
499	00:30:19	00:30:21	Hey, we’re outta here!
500	00:30:21	00:30:25	You know, I’m starting to think that maybe we should be looking for a man.
501	00:30:25	00:30:28	Only 3% of multiple killers are female.
502	00:30:28	00:30:30	And a woman wouldn’t need a trophy.
503	00:30:30	00:30:32	And a body on ice is definitely a trophy.
504	00:30:32	00:30:35	Well, Ms. Hard-ass travels with her boyfriend.
505	00:30:35	00:30:38	I bet you a lot of guys travel with their girlfriends.
506	00:30:38	00:30:41	What if it was a man with a woman who would do anything he asked?
507	00:30:55	00:30:57	Then I said, Hey, us guys have to stick together.
508	00:30:57	00:31:01	He’s like, Right. You’re the man!
509	00:31:01	00:31:06	So, I mean, I could’ve used an STR-DNA but it’s too state-of-the-art, it’s overkill.
510	00:31:06	00:31:09	So I used an HLA-DQ-A1 with a...
511	00:31:09	00:31:11	polymarker.
512	00:31:11	00:31:15	That’s--that’s very, very interesting.
513	00:31:15	00:31:17	You don’t care about this at all, do you?
514	00:31:17	00:31:19	No. ( chuckles )
515	00:31:19	00:31:24	But to be honest with you, all I really care about is whether the charges against me are going to be dropped.
516	00:31:28	00:31:29	Are they?
517	00:31:32	00:31:34	The D.A. threw out the case.
518	00:31:34	00:31:36	Great.
519	00:31:36	00:31:40	So I can shoplift at that boutique again?
520	00:31:40	00:31:42	I was kidding, I was kidding.
521	00:31:42	00:31:45	Besides, they never have any good sales there, anyway.
522	00:31:50	00:31:53	I’d invite you out for coffee, but...
523	00:31:53	00:31:54	it’s probably a bad idea.
524	00:31:54	00:31:56	Uh, yeah.
525	00:31:56	00:31:57	Yeah.
526	00:31:59	00:32:05	But I can call you sometime, you know, just in case I ever get into trouble or something.
527	00:32:05	00:32:08	Maybe you should try not getting into trouble.
528	00:32:08	00:32:11	You do owe me one.
529	00:32:13	00:32:14	I owe you two.
530	00:32:29	00:32:31	You know where to find me.
531	00:32:40	00:32:43	Is that right?
532	00:32:43	00:32:45	Your boy Kenny just lawyered up.
533	00:32:45	00:32:50	Well, we got a warrant, so that should give us the room for a minute.
534	00:32:52	00:32:54	There’s something wrong with it.
535	00:32:54	00:32:56	Computers turn on.
536	00:32:56	00:32:57	When they don’t, it’s for a reason.
537	00:32:57	00:32:59	Did you plug it in?
538	00:32:59	00:33:00	The power light’s on.
539	00:33:02	00:33:03	Really?
540	00:33:07	00:33:08	Let me check it out.
541	00:33:14	00:33:17	Well, he’s a sneaky S.O.B., I give him that.
542	00:33:17	00:33:21	Oh, o one is gonna believe this.
543	00:33:22	00:33:23	All right.
544	00:33:29	00:33:30	Let me see that flashlight.
545	00:33:31	00:33:33	There’s scratches all over it.
546	00:33:33	00:33:35	Nothing really special about them.
547	00:33:35	00:33:38	And the hotshot takes another strike.
548	00:33:38	00:33:39	Check it out.
549	00:33:39	00:33:45	Not enough to cause even a small scratch on your finger, but more than enough to use as a basis for comparison.
550	00:33:45	00:33:47	We match this to the broken window, we got him.
551	00:33:47	00:33:51	One, two, three.
552	00:33:51	00:33:57	Left one is from the broken window the other one is from the gun, both dropping at an identical rate.
553	00:33:57	00:33:59	Glass is from the same source.
554	00:33:59	00:34:03	So Kenny broke the window from the inside using the butt of the gun.
555	00:34:03	00:34:06	My theory...
556	00:34:06	00:34:09	The brother was the executor of the parents’ estate.
557	00:34:09	00:34:11	He controlled the family money.
558	00:34:11	00:34:13	Sounds like more than a theory.
559	00:34:13	00:34:15	I called the county clerk.
560	00:34:15	00:34:18	With the brother out of the way, Kenny is the sole beneficiary.
561	00:34:18	00:34:21	Do you have any idea how much money I’ve lost?
562	00:34:21	00:34:23	Kenny, come on, what are you doing?
563	00:34:23	00:34:25	I’m your brother, okay?
564	00:34:25	00:34:28	I already said I’d loan you the money, okay?
565	00:34:28	00:34:29	Come on! $20,000?
566	00:34:29	00:34:32	That doesn’t even begin to solve my problems!
567	00:35:00	00:35:04	Slam that jail door.
568	00:35:04	00:35:07	Makes you reconsider, doesn’t it?
569	00:35:07	00:35:10	I never said you weren’t a good CSI.
570	00:35:18	00:35:22	We’re state-of-the-art here-- number one in vehicle satellite tracking.
571	00:35:22	00:35:26	I can locate one or all of our trucks with just a click of a mouse, 24-7.
572	00:35:26	00:35:30	Do you ever worry that technology is gonna make us obsolete?
573	00:35:30	00:35:32	No.
574	00:35:32	00:35:36	Can you, uh, narrow your database?
575	00:35:36	00:35:40	Say, eliminate all trucks that are not refrigerated?
576	00:35:40	00:35:42	Yeah, I think I can.
577	00:35:44	00:35:49	Can you eliminate all trucks that were not in Las Vegas yesterday?
578	00:35:53	00:35:57	Eliminate all trucks that only travel in state.
579	00:36:00	00:36:06	Now eliminate the trucks that don’t deliver to supermarkets along the I-15.
580	00:36:08	00:36:09	This is very cool.
581	00:36:09	00:36:13	Eliminate all trucks that did not deliver to Marty’s Market yesterday.
582	00:36:17	00:36:18	That’s our guy.
583	00:36:18	00:36:21	He delivered to all five towns all five supermarkets.
584	00:36:21	00:36:22	Where is he now?
585	00:36:28	00:36:30	Police! Get your hands up!
586	00:36:35	00:36:36	Police!
587	00:36:36	00:36:39	Step away from the truck and put your hands on the back of your head!
588	00:36:39	00:36:41	Keep your hands in sight! Get out of the truck!
589	00:36:41	00:36:43	Hands over your head!
590	00:36:45	00:36:47	Step away from the truck.
591	00:36:47	00:36:49	Put your hands on the back of your head.
592	00:36:49	00:36:51	I’m just making my regular delivery...
593	00:36:51	00:36:53	Don’t make me ask you twice.
594	00:36:53	00:36:55	Move! Hands on the back of your head!
595	00:36:55	00:36:57	Hands on the back of your head!
596	00:36:59	00:37:02	Left hand on the wall, right hand on the wall.
597	00:37:02	00:37:04	Check him for weapons.
598	00:37:04	00:37:07	Spread your legs. Nice and easy.
599	00:37:07	00:37:09	Hey, get away from my truck!
600	00:37:09	00:37:11	It’s not your truck anymore. It’s our crime scene.
601	00:37:11	00:37:13	Come with me. Check the cab.
602	00:37:17	00:37:18	It’s all yours.
603	00:37:21	00:37:23	All clear here, sir.
604	00:38:28	00:38:29	We got three.
605	00:38:37	00:38:39	Where is she?
606	00:38:41	00:38:43	Where is Margaret Shorey?
607	00:38:45	00:38:47	Screw you, man.
608	00:38:49	00:38:52	Look, pal, I already know what happened.
609	00:38:52	00:38:58	I even know your type-- Decent, trusting, middle-aged women.
610	00:38:58	00:39:00	Please help me...
611	00:39:00	00:39:02	You got to help me! I locked my baby in the car!
612	00:39:02	00:39:05	Did you call the manager? It is so hot, she’s gonna die.
613	00:39:05	00:39:06	Please help me!
614	00:39:06	00:39:08	All... all right.
615	00:39:08	00:39:09	Where’s your car?
616	00:39:09	00:39:11	This way.
617	00:39:14	00:39:17	Go on! Write it!
618	00:39:36	00:39:37	Okay. All right, listen.
619	00:39:37	00:39:41	First one of you lowlifes can name that tune gets to make a deal.
620	00:39:41	00:39:44	Hmm?
621	00:39:44	00:39:47	The difference between the chair or life in prison.
622	00:39:47	00:39:48	So...
623	00:39:50	00:39:52	He made me do it.
624	00:39:52	00:39:54	( screams ) Cuff him.
625	00:39:54	00:39:56	Let me go!
626	00:39:57	00:39:59	Hey, hey, hey...
627	00:40:03	00:40:05	Where is she?
628	00:40:42	00:40:43	There’s a lock.
629	00:40:43	00:40:44	Are there any keys?
630	00:40:48	00:40:50	Try those.
631	00:41:03	00:41:05	Hello, Margaret.
632	00:41:05	00:41:06	My name is Gil.
633	00:41:06	00:41:09	This is Catherine.
634	00:41:09	00:41:11	We’re gonna take you home.
635	00:41:19	00:41:21	You look lost.
636	00:41:21	00:41:23	Oh, yeah...
637	00:41:23	00:41:25	Do you know Warrick Brown?
638	00:41:25	00:41:28	Yeah, you want me to tell him you’re here?
639	00:41:28	00:41:30	Oh, he’s probably working.
640	00:41:30	00:41:32	He works really hard.
641	00:41:32	00:41:36	If you see him, could you just tell him that, uh, Jason says thanks?
642	00:41:36	00:41:38	Okay. Will he know what for?
643	00:41:38	00:41:39	Uh...
644	00:41:39	00:41:40	Hey, Jas, how you doing?
645	00:41:40	00:41:42	Better.
646	00:41:42	00:41:45	Hey, thanks for busting me loose.
647	00:41:45	00:41:46	My mom said she’ll pay you back.
648	00:41:46	00:41:49	No, you’ll pay me back, shorty.
649	00:41:49	00:41:51	Just don’t be pulling any more fire alarms.
650	00:41:51	00:41:52	I won’t.
651	00:41:52	00:41:54	Gets you more attention than you want.
652	00:41:54	00:41:55	I know.
653	00:41:55	00:41:56	You still working on those moves I showed you?
654	00:41:56	00:41:58	Yeah, every day after school.
655	00:41:58	00:41:59	How about that?
656	00:41:59	00:42:01	How about that right there?
657	00:42:01	00:42:02	Good.
658	00:42:02	00:42:03	Hey, I got to go.
659	00:42:03	00:42:05	My mom’s waiting for me.
660	00:42:05	00:42:08	Hey, come here.
661	00:42:08	00:42:09	Apologize to your mom, all right?
662	00:42:09	00:42:11	Let her know she can trust you.
663	00:42:11	00:42:13	Yeah. All right?
664	00:42:13	00:42:15	Bye, Warrick, uh... see you next week.
665	00:42:15	00:42:19	See you next week, Jaws.
666	00:42:19	00:42:23	So you went to the casino to win bail money.
667	00:42:23	00:42:24	He needed my help.
668	00:42:24	00:42:25	I didn’t win anything, Sara.
669	00:42:25	00:42:26	You’re a CSI.
670	00:42:26	00:42:27	You saw me enter a casino.
671	00:42:27	00:42:28	Did you see me place a bet?
672	00:42:28	00:42:30	You want to tell me you didn’t?
673	00:42:30	00:42:32	I don’t have to tell you anything.
674	00:42:34	00:42:40	Look, I went there to collect a debt that was owed to me.
675	00:42:40	00:42:42	We’re supposed to be working together.
676	00:42:42	00:42:47	Next time, just try talking to me instead of going around behind my back.
