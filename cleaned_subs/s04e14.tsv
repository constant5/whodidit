0	00:00:12	00:00:14	What do you need to get?
1	00:00:14	00:00:16	Actually, it's what you need to get, rook.
2	00:00:16	00:00:18	Aw, come on, man. We're off duty.
3	00:00:18	00:00:21	You're off when I say you're off.
4	00:00:28	00:00:29	Don't forget the Ho-Hos.
5	00:00:48	00:00:51	Yeah...
6	00:00:52	00:00:54	I can help you over here, sir.
7	00:00:54	00:00:57	That's not what your light says.
8	00:00:58	00:00:59	Slow night?
9	00:00:59	00:01:00	Kind of.
10	00:01:01	00:01:05	Oh... can't forget the Ho-Hos.
11	00:01:17	00:01:20	What the hell is wrong with you people?
12	00:01:20	00:01:22	My wife is still in there!
13	00:01:23	00:01:25	Why isn't anybody helping my wife?!
14	00:01:28	00:01:30	Body count's five.
15	00:01:47	00:01:50	Officer Clay entered the store unaware of a robbery that was in progress.
16	00:01:50	00:01:53	Officer Fromansky came in after he heard a shot fired.
17	00:01:53	00:01:55	Engaged two suspects.
18	00:01:55	00:01:57	Lit the place up.
19	00:02:00	00:02:02	The ski masks are John Does.
20	00:02:02	00:02:05	The rest have wallet IDs.
21	00:02:13	00:02:17	Woman at the back is Julia Reed, cocktail waitress at the Tangiers.
22	00:02:22	00:02:29	Man on Aisle Four is Rufus Sanders, cab driver.
23	00:02:43	00:02:45	How you want us to handle this, Grissom?
24	00:02:46	00:02:49	Same way you'd eat an elephant...
25	00:02:49	00:02:53	one bite at a time.
26	00:02:57	00:02:59	Hey, Jim...
27	00:03:00	00:03:05	did you know that Charles Manson is only 5'2?
28	00:03:05	00:03:07	Yeah, little guys tend to overcompensate.
29	00:03:07	00:03:10	Do you remember the, uh, story about...
30	00:03:10	00:03:14	how and where the marshals found old Charlie when they raided Barker Ranch?
31	00:03:14	00:03:17	Yeah. I always, uh...
32	00:03:17	00:03:20	I always liked that story.
33	00:03:26	00:03:27	We need a medic!
34	00:03:30	00:03:34	and Volkswagen. On the road of life there are passengers and there are drivers.
35	00:04:04	00:04:07	All right, tell me what happened.
36	00:04:07	00:04:10	I was in my radio car when I heard shots fired.
37	00:04:10	00:04:12	I called for backup. I went in.
38	00:04:13	00:04:14	Clay, talk to me.
39	00:04:14	00:04:15	Clay!
40	00:04:22	00:04:23	How many shots you fire?
41	00:04:23	00:04:27	Three. No, four. I fired four.
42	00:04:27	00:04:30	Then what? I saw my partner on the floor.
43	00:04:30	00:04:32	I went towards him.
44	00:04:32	00:04:34	Second gunman came at me.
45	00:04:40	00:04:43	How many shots you fire at the second gunman, total?
46	00:04:44	00:04:46	Maybe-maybe five.
47	00:04:46	00:04:49	I'd taken a shot in my vest.
48	00:04:49	00:04:51	Hard to count under those conditions. Are you sure?
49	00:04:51	00:04:53	No, I'm not sure. That's why I said maybe...
50	00:04:55	00:04:57	...but I know I shot four at the third guy.
51	00:04:57	00:04:59	I was going to check on my partner.
52	00:04:59	00:05:01	I caught movement in the back.
53	00:05:01	00:05:03	Black coat, ski mask, gun...
54	00:05:03	00:05:04	I put him down.
55	00:05:09	00:05:10	He fire at you?
56	00:05:10	00:05:12	Didn't give him a chance.
57	00:05:12	00:05:13	All right, that's all we need for now.
58	00:05:13	00:05:16	I need your weapon.
59	00:05:17	00:05:19	My partner...
60	00:05:19	00:05:20	I want to be the one to tell his wife.
61	00:05:21	00:05:22	He was my responsibility.
62	00:05:22	00:05:24	All right.
63	00:05:26	00:05:29	All right, look, if you're not going to say it, I will.
64	00:05:30	00:05:34	Fromansky said he killed three, and there are two dead ski masks in there.
65	00:05:34	00:05:38	Now, you cranked him up pretty good on that vigilante case last year.
66	00:05:38	00:05:39	Is that going to be a problem?
67	00:05:40	00:05:42	No.
68	00:05:45	00:05:48	Everybody, could I please have your attention?
69	00:05:48	00:05:51	All right, folks, I know that you've been through an awful lot this evening.
70	00:05:51	00:05:59	If you could just bear with me a little longer, I need to talk with every one of you one at a time, so I promise to get you out of here as quickly as possible.
71	00:06:00	00:06:04	Is the, uh, guy in black the cocktail waitress' husband?
72	00:06:04	00:06:07	Yeah. Do you want him first?
73	00:06:07	00:06:09	I don't think he's ready for me just yet.
74	00:06:09	00:06:11	I'm going to get to him soon enough.
75	00:06:24	00:06:26	What happened to your assault in Henderson?
76	00:06:26	00:06:27	I closed it.
77	00:06:27	00:06:28	Where do you need me?
78	00:06:29	00:06:30	There's two more bodies over by the beer.
79	00:06:30	00:06:33	You got it.
80	00:06:38	00:06:40	Barely cleared the holster.
81	00:06:40	00:06:42	Reflex, maybe. Pulled the trigger before he had a target.
82	00:06:44	00:06:47	Not quick enough.
83	00:06:52	00:06:56	Those two guys came out of nowhere... made everybody go to the corner.
84	00:06:56	00:06:58	Where, specifically?
85	00:06:58	00:07:01	Uh... dry goods.
86	00:07:01	00:07:02	Then one guy grabs Celeste...
87	00:07:06	00:07:07	Which guy?
88	00:07:07	00:07:10	I was looking at his piece, not his face, okay?
89	00:07:10	00:07:11	Shotgun or handgun?
90	00:07:11	00:07:17	Shotgun. He drags her over to the registers, makes her open 'em up. She does.
91	00:07:17	00:07:21	They're pulling out the cash, and then he sees the cops roll up.
92	00:07:21	00:07:25	Second guy says, Everybody, get down and don't say a freaking word, so that's what I did.
93	00:07:26	00:07:28	And then...
94	00:07:29	00:07:30	And then?
95	00:07:31	00:07:34	Ankles and flashes and booms.
96	00:07:34	00:07:37	That's all I remember.
97	00:07:37	00:07:39	And you never moved from that spot?
98	00:07:39	00:07:41	No, I didn't.
99	00:07:41	00:07:43	Do you have somewhere you need to be?
100	00:07:47	00:07:49	I got to change my pants.
101	00:07:52	00:07:54	Sorry.
102	00:08:26	00:08:29	Well, you know, we're not the most modern store around.
103	00:08:29	00:08:31	How long is the surveillance loop?
104	00:08:31	00:08:33	About 24 hours.
105	00:08:42	00:08:45	What, uh... what happened to these tapes here?
106	00:08:45	00:08:46	Nothing.
107	00:08:46	00:08:48	These are active cameras, right?
108	00:08:48	00:08:50	Those VCRs are busted.
109	00:08:50	00:08:51	Never got 'em fixed.
110	00:08:51	00:08:53	You know, cutbacks.
111	00:08:53	00:08:54	Over the register and outside works.
112	00:08:54	00:08:56	That's all we really need.
113	00:08:56	00:08:57	Gotta keep an eye on the employees, right?
114	00:08:58	00:09:01	They steal worse than the customers.
115	00:09:14	00:09:16	You know, this guy hit a $75 jackpot.
116	00:09:16	00:09:19	Probably shoving quarters in his pockets when this whole thing went down.
117	00:09:19	00:09:20	The door was 20 feet away.
118	00:09:20	00:09:21	He probably could've made a run for it.
119	00:09:21	00:09:25	You know, after the MGM Grand fire, they found people fused to slot machines.
120	00:09:26	00:09:27	Never even made it out of their seats.
121	00:09:27	00:09:29	This guy probably thought it was his lucky day.
122	00:09:29	00:09:32	I'm sure he wasn't going to leave without his money.
123	00:09:34	00:09:39	We all just started running when those two psychos started shooting it out with the cop...
124	00:09:48	00:09:58	I took a first aid course about a hundred years ago, so I-I-I tried to keep pressure on the wound, but it just kept bleeding, you know?
125	00:09:58	00:10:02	I couldn't leave Rufus all alone, scared, dying.
126	00:10:02	00:10:04	You were friends?
127	00:10:04	00:10:05	Mm, sort of.
128	00:10:06	00:10:09	He-he'd come in a couple of times a week and play the quarter slots.
129	00:10:09	00:10:13	From where you and Rufus were, could you see Officer Fromansky?
130	00:10:13	00:10:15	Oh, the cop who saved us?
131	00:10:15	00:10:18	No. I couldn't see anything.
132	00:10:18	00:10:22	I just heard all that gunfire just blasting away.
133	00:10:57	00:10:58	Hey.
134	00:10:58	00:11:00	Hey.
135	00:11:00	00:11:03	Entry wound's on the left side.
136	00:11:03	00:11:04	There's no exit wound?
137	00:11:21	00:11:22	Skin's thicker on the back.
138	00:11:22	00:11:23	Captured the bullet.
139	00:11:23	00:11:25	We'll retrieve it at autopsy.
140	00:11:27	00:11:29	I was, uh...
141	00:11:29	00:11:32	holding Julia's hand trying to find a place to hide...
142	00:11:32	00:11:33	somewhere safe.
143	00:11:35	00:11:39	It was those stupid heels, you know.
144	00:11:39	00:11:41	She was always forgetting to bring her flats to work.
145	00:11:51	00:11:53	They didn't have to shoot her.
146	00:11:53	00:11:54	They were wearing masks.
147	00:11:54	00:11:56	We didn't even get a good look at them.
148	00:11:56	00:12:00	Mr. Reed, you can't look for reasons here.
149	00:12:02	00:12:04	We'll have it out in a second.
150	00:12:06	00:12:09	The trick is to apply even pressure all around.
151	00:12:11	00:12:13	Is there something wrong with tweezers?
152	00:12:13	00:12:16	They can mess up the striae.
153	00:12:16	00:12:20	You've got enough to deal with without my toolmarks in the mix.
154	00:12:20	00:12:22	Here we go.
155	00:12:23	00:12:25	Huh.
156	00:12:25	00:12:27	Paper or plastic?
157	00:12:34	00:12:38	Officer Clay's already been processed.
158	00:12:38	00:12:40	We wanted to get him to his family.
159	00:12:40	00:12:42	Did you get prints off the two suspects?
160	00:12:42	00:12:43	Uh, yeah.
161	00:12:43	00:12:45	They're right here.
162	00:12:45	00:12:48	And we also got bullets from both of them.
163	00:12:49	00:12:50	Good.
164	00:12:55	00:12:57	Prison tattoos.
165	00:12:57	00:13:00	They weren't virgins.
166	00:13:02	00:13:07	Hi, I was wondering if I might be able to speak with Celeste Turner.
167	00:13:07	00:13:08	She, uh, has a gunshot wound.
168	00:13:09	00:13:11	She was brought in from the grocery store robbery.
169	00:13:11	00:13:14	Right. Curtain Three.
170	00:13:14	00:13:17	Just out of surgery. Stable.
171	00:13:17	00:13:18	She's still pretty doped up, though.
172	00:13:19	00:13:21	You're going to have to come back later.
173	00:13:21	00:13:22	You going to need these?
174	00:13:22	00:13:24	Yes. Thank you.
175	00:13:24	00:13:31	What can you tell me about the little boy who was also brought in from the robbery incident?
176	00:13:31	00:13:34	Minor injuries. He's fine. Mostly shock.
177	00:13:34	00:13:36	He's with his mom.
178	00:13:36	00:13:37	Hell of a night, huh?
179	00:13:37	00:13:39	Take your kid to work, both end up shot.
180	00:13:39	00:13:44	Wait a minute. So, the little boy's mother is Celeste Turner?
181	00:13:44	00:13:45	Yeah.
182	00:14:09	00:14:12	Son of a bitch was behind her the whole time.
183	00:14:12	00:14:13	Yeah.
184	00:14:16	00:14:18	Okay, here's what I got so far...
185	00:14:19	00:14:21	There's our two DOA suspects.
186	00:14:22	00:14:25	Looks like they just walked in off the street.
187	00:14:27	00:14:31	Is there any sign of Fromansky's mystery gunner?
188	00:14:31	00:14:37	No. All the cars in the parking lot were accounted for, and the loading dock out back was deserted, so...
189	00:14:38	00:14:40	This is the only view of what went down.
190	00:14:46	00:14:47	And see here?
191	00:14:47	00:14:49	Here comes our cop.
192	00:14:49	00:14:52	Three, four feet away, doesn't even see him.
193	00:14:52	00:14:59	The thing I hate the most is the bad guys always know if there's going to be a gunfight.
194	00:15:01	00:15:04	Officer Clay's one shot went into the floor.
195	00:15:04	00:15:05	The bullet fragmented.
196	00:15:05	00:15:07	That's probably how that kid got hit.
197	00:15:07	00:15:13	But Officer Fromansky's Beretta and that suspect's TEC-9, they both had hollow .9 millimeters.
198	00:15:13	00:15:16	Between the two of them, they shot off 18 rounds.
199	00:15:16	00:15:18	Shotgun was a Mossberg, model 500.
200	00:15:18	00:15:19	Eight rounds fired.
201	00:15:19	00:15:22	Ammo was double-aught buckshot, nine pellets per shell.
202	00:15:22	00:15:27	18 bullets, a total of 26 shells, 72 pellets. Enjoy.
203	00:15:31	00:15:33	Firing two shots!
204	00:16:56	00:16:58	Warrick.
205	00:17:05	00:17:07	Grissom, we got a problem.
206	00:17:07	00:17:08	Only one?
207	00:17:08	00:17:11	We've identified all the bullets recovered at the scene.
208	00:17:11	00:17:14	There's no evidence of a third gunmen.
209	00:17:14	00:17:15	It gets worse.
210	00:17:15	00:17:19	The bullet that killed the cocktail waitress-- it came from Fromansky's gun.
211	00:17:24	00:17:25	How you feeling, Officer?
212	00:17:25	00:17:27	Little sore.
213	00:17:27	00:17:30	Desk duty hurts a lot more.
214	00:17:30	00:17:33	Is there anything you want to add to your statement?
215	00:17:33	00:17:37	What's he saying I did this time?
216	00:17:37	00:17:39	A bullet from your gun killed a cocktail waitress.
217	00:17:42	00:17:43	A ricochet.
218	00:17:43	00:17:45	No.
219	00:17:45	00:17:46	A clean shot.
220	00:17:46	00:17:48	Not possible.
221	00:17:48	00:17:50	No one at the scene saw a third gunman.
222	00:17:50	00:17:52	I would never shoot at a civilian.
223	00:17:52	00:17:56	I saw a guy wearing a ski mask, dark coat, holding a gun.
224	00:17:56	00:17:59	The girl was wearing a black sweater, carrying a purse.
225	00:17:59	00:18:00	I didn't shoot at that.
226	00:18:01	00:18:02	You'd just took a full load in the chest.
227	00:18:02	00:18:03	Maybe you were confused.
228	00:18:03	00:18:05	Wasn't confused.
229	00:18:06	00:18:11	Your statement says that you fired four shots at this third gunman.
230	00:18:11	00:18:12	Yeah.
231	00:18:12	00:18:16	Ballistics evidence shows that you spread five shots over the back wall.
232	00:18:16	00:18:18	So I fired more than I thought. So what.
233	00:18:18	00:18:22	I was engaged with multiple hostile targets You're not back in the Gulf.
234	00:18:22	00:18:23	You're a police officer.
235	00:18:23	00:18:24	You're supposed to identify a target.
236	00:18:24	00:18:26	And that's what I did.
237	00:18:27	00:18:31	What are you, pissed off because the last time you tried to jam me up didn't work?
238	00:18:31	00:18:32	Hey, ease up.
239	00:18:32	00:18:34	What I said in my statement is the truth.
240	00:18:34	00:18:38	The truth is, we have a dead civilian with your bullet in her.
241	00:18:42	00:18:44	This going to the next step?
242	00:18:44	00:18:47	It has to.
243	00:18:48	00:18:52	You're on administrative leave pending an IAB review.
244	00:18:54	00:18:58	There was no way I could warn that cop.
245	00:19:01	00:19:03	I wanted to...
246	00:19:03	00:19:08	but the guy was right there, under the counter...
247	00:19:08	00:19:11	pushing his gun right into my stomach.
248	00:19:14	00:19:16	I'm sorry.
249	00:19:16	00:19:19	You're not the one that pulled the trigger.
250	00:19:19	00:19:23	Ms. Turner, what was your son doing there with you?
251	00:19:23	00:19:26	Well, my ex was looking after him that night.
252	00:19:26	00:19:30	Then the son of a bitch shows up at the store.
253	00:19:30	00:19:32	Had a party to go to.
254	00:19:32	00:19:35	Practically shoved Henry out of the car.
255	00:19:35	00:19:36	I mean...
256	00:19:36	00:19:40	I'm not allowed to bring kids to work.
257	00:19:40	00:19:46	So I snuck Henry into the office, and I told him to stay there.
258	00:19:47	00:19:48	Then?
259	00:19:48	00:19:52	Then those two maniacs came in.
260	00:19:52	00:19:54	They shot that poor policeman.
261	00:19:59	00:20:03	And then everything just went crazy.
262	00:20:03	00:20:05	I was running, and I ran to go find Henry...
263	00:20:05	00:20:08	but I couldn't find him anywhere.
264	00:20:09	00:20:10	Henry!
265	00:20:14	00:20:17	That's all I remember.
266	00:20:22	00:20:24	Henry likes his candy, doesn't he?
267	00:20:25	00:20:28	He's got five cavities to prove it.
268	00:20:28	00:20:30	How'd you know?
269	00:20:30	00:20:34	Well, we found him in a storage cabinet, near the candy rack.
270	00:20:34	00:20:37	He never listens to me.
271	00:20:39	00:20:43	Double counts, two people in the room at all times.
272	00:20:43	00:20:48	When you're done, match the total amounts with the register receipts, okay?
273	00:20:48	00:20:55	So, explain to me what all the money was doing in the registers and not the store safe.
274	00:20:55	00:20:58	See that light? It's called a halo.
275	00:20:58	00:21:01	It's keyed to the sensor in the cash register.
276	00:21:01	00:21:07	Now, at a preset amount, that light goes off, letting the store manager know it's time to transfer the cash to the safe.
277	00:21:07	00:21:09	Now check this out...
278	00:21:14	00:21:16	Most of the halos are lit.
279	00:21:16	00:21:19	Maximum cash, just lying in the drawers.
280	00:21:19	00:21:21	So, those guys did their homework.
281	00:21:21	00:21:24	They picked the perfect time to hit. Mm-hmm.
282	00:21:24	00:21:30	AFIS hits on our suspects, both just recently released from five-year sentences at Lompoc.
283	00:21:30	00:21:32	California boys.
284	00:21:32	00:21:33	Born and raised.
285	00:21:33	00:21:35	Okay. Let's do this.
286	00:21:35	00:21:39	Officer Clay was killed by a single close-range shotgun blast to the back of the head.
287	00:21:39	00:21:42	Excessive penetration and laceration of the brain.
288	00:21:42	00:21:44	Suspect Clyde Tremmel...
289	00:21:44	00:21:47	The TEC-9 guy.
290	00:21:47	00:21:53	Two distant-range, medium-caliber gunshot wounds to the front of the chest, with penetration of the lung and heart.
291	00:21:54	00:21:55	Suspect Jack Delver...
292	00:21:55	00:21:57	Shotgun guy.
293	00:21:57	00:22:05	One distant-range, medium-caliber gunshot wound to the forehead. The bullet penetrated the brain and was recovered in the occipital lobe.
294	00:22:06	00:22:08	Rufus Sanders, bystander...
295	00:22:08	00:22:11	Five scattered buckshot perforations on the outer thigh.
296	00:22:11	00:22:14	One severed the femoral artery, resulting in massive hemorrhage.
297	00:22:14	00:22:18	And Julia Reed, cocktail waitress.
298	00:22:18	00:22:21	Single medium-caliber gunshot wound to the left chest.
299	00:22:21	00:22:28	The bullet perforated the lung and thoracic aorta, then perforated the opposite lung. And that's it.
300	00:22:28	00:22:30	Thanks, Doc.
301	00:22:37	00:22:39	Catherine, something bothering you?
302	00:22:39	00:22:41	A little.
303	00:22:41	00:22:44	Look, I came here to pick up my wife's body.
304	00:22:44	00:22:45	I already gave you my statement.
305	00:22:45	00:22:49	Well, we just need a few more details before we can release the body.
306	00:22:49	00:22:50	I promise this won't be long.
307	00:22:51	00:22:52	What?
308	00:22:52	00:22:57	Well, you said that your wife fell during the gunfight, that that's how you got separated.
309	00:22:57	00:22:58	Yeah.
310	00:22:58	00:23:02	Do you recall exactly how she fell?
311	00:23:02	00:23:03	Well, what do you mean?
312	00:23:03	00:23:04	How did she land?
313	00:23:04	00:23:09	Did she land sideways, backwards...?
314	00:23:09	00:23:12	She fell forward, I think.
315	00:23:12	00:23:13	She fell forward.
316	00:23:13	00:23:17	So her hands broke the fall, landed on her knees?
317	00:23:17	00:23:18	Yeah.
318	00:23:19	00:23:26	Well, there weren't any bruises or scrapes on her knees or elbows, which is leading me to believe that she didn't fall.
319	00:23:26	00:23:28	Well, what's-what's the difference?
320	00:23:28	00:23:29	She's dead.
321	00:23:30	00:23:39	Mr. Reed, there were a lot of bullets flying around that store and a lot of victims, and every detail is important, but they don't help if they're not accurate.
322	00:23:41	00:23:43	Well, when we started running...
323	00:23:45	00:23:46	she was right behind me.
324	00:23:52	00:23:58	She froze up.
325	00:23:58	00:24:02	Just stood there looking right at me...
326	00:24:02	00:24:05	scared out of her mind.
327	00:24:05	00:24:09	I... yelled at her to get down, to come over to me.
328	00:24:11	00:24:14	Sh-She wouldn't move.
329	00:24:14	00:24:17	I mean I'm...
330	00:24:17	00:24:20	I'm pretty sure I yelled.
331	00:24:20	00:24:23	Highlight the shots that killed the TEC-9 shooter.
332	00:24:25	00:24:29	Fromansky said that he fired three or four shots at that target.
333	00:24:29	00:24:31	He fired four.
334	00:24:31	00:24:32	That accounts for those shots.
335	00:24:40	00:24:44	Okay, the guy with the shotgun was killed with... one bullet.
336	00:24:44	00:24:48	Well, those four shots were definitely meant for him.
337	00:24:48	00:24:53	But this shot is closer to the second gunman than it is to the cocktail waitress.
338	00:24:53	00:24:58	Well, Fromansky was turning when he fired so his shots were spread out.
339	00:25:14	00:25:16	Okay.
340	00:25:17	00:25:22	Which means Fromansky fired four shots at a target at the back of the store.
341	00:25:23	00:25:24	Just like he said he did.
342	00:25:24	00:25:25	Yeah.
343	00:25:29	00:25:35	At the walk-through you said that you saw a third suspect at the back of the store.
344	00:25:35	00:25:37	Why did you make the decision to shoot?
345	00:25:37	00:25:39	I was in fear for my life.
346	00:25:39	00:25:41	Did you see a weapon?
347	00:25:41	00:25:42	Yes.
348	00:25:42	00:25:44	What kind?
349	00:25:45	00:25:48	A semiautomatic pistol.
350	00:25:48	00:25:50	So you fired first.
351	00:25:50	00:25:51	Yes.
352	00:25:51	00:25:53	Four times. Yes.
353	00:25:53	00:25:57	Can you explain the lack of evidence for a third suspect at the scene?
354	00:25:57	00:25:59	That's not my job.
355	00:26:02	00:26:06	Right or wrong, there'll be guys on the job who'll think this was personal.
356	00:26:06	00:26:08	They'd be wrong.
357	00:26:08	00:26:12	Did you see Julia Reed in your line of fire?
358	00:26:12	00:26:13	No.
359	00:26:15	00:26:23	According to Supervising Criminalist Grissom's report, you had an unobstructed view of Ms. Reed, so how do you explain the fact that you didn't see her?
360	00:26:25	00:26:27	I can't.
361	00:26:27	00:26:32	You don't deny that a bullet from your weapon killed her?
362	00:26:32	00:26:35	I'm not denying that.
363	00:26:35	00:26:38	But you can't explain it?
364	00:26:39	00:26:42	No.
365	00:26:42	00:26:45	Look, your partner was dead.
366	00:26:46	00:26:47	You'd been shot.
367	00:26:47	00:26:51	You saw someone you thought was a suspect and you fired.
368	00:26:51	00:26:56	Under those circumstances, any one of us could make a mistake.
369	00:26:56	00:26:59	Did you?
370	00:27:02	00:27:06	Officer Fromansky, answer the question.
371	00:27:11	00:27:13	He says yes, he's a bad cop.
372	00:27:13	00:27:17	He says no, he's a liar.
373	00:27:17	00:27:22	Maybe he really doesn't know what happened.
374	00:27:29	00:27:30	A little over.
375	00:27:30	00:27:33	Perfect.
376	00:27:33	00:27:36	Let's say I'm Fromansky.
377	00:27:41	00:27:44	There's nothing between Fromansky and the cocktail waitress.
378	00:27:44	00:27:46	I got a clean view and a clear shot.
379	00:27:49	00:27:53	Hey, take a look at this.
380	00:27:53	00:28:01	The cracks in the glass from shot 22 are terminated by the cracks from shot 23.
381	00:28:10	00:28:13	So, shot 23 had to occur before shot 22.
382	00:28:13	00:28:20	Which means that Fromansky was firing from left to right, not right to left.
383	00:28:27	00:28:30	Four shots on a level spread.
384	00:28:30	00:28:32	He was shooting at a moving target.
385	00:28:32	00:28:36	According to Catherine's witness, the cocktail waitress wasn't moving.
386	00:28:36	00:28:38	She was a stationary target.
387	00:28:40	00:28:46	So, if he was shooting at a moving target, where was it moving to?
388	00:29:07	00:29:09	We have the surveillance tape.
389	00:29:09	00:29:15	Shows nothing going on here before, during or after the robbery.
390	00:29:16	00:29:22	Well, just because it shows nothing doesn't mean it's seeing everything.
391	00:29:24	00:29:26	You can see me now, right?
392	00:29:26	00:29:28	Keep moving to your right.
393	00:29:28	00:29:30	All right.
394	00:29:30	00:29:32	Keep going.
395	00:29:32	00:29:33	I'm still in?
396	00:29:33	00:29:34	Keep going.
397	00:29:34	00:29:36	Right there.
398	00:29:36	00:29:37	NOW you're out.
399	00:29:54	00:29:55	Tell me what you see.
400	00:29:55	00:29:58	A getaway.
401	00:30:04	00:30:07	We found metal paint scrapings and skid marks.
402	00:30:07	00:30:08	Both recent on that loading dock.
403	00:30:08	00:30:10	These guys definitely had a wheelman.
404	00:30:10	00:30:13	Yeah, guy slips in after everything gets started.
405	00:30:13	00:30:15	During the confusion, nobody sees him.
406	00:30:15	00:30:17	Or no one that was alive to tell anyway.
407	00:30:17	00:30:19	Except Fromansky. Yeah.
408	00:30:19	00:30:20	Well, the suspects knew there was a blind spot.
409	00:30:21	00:30:22	It has to be an inside job.
410	00:30:22	00:30:23	Oh, no doubt.
411	00:30:23	00:30:27	Matched the cash from the garbage bag to the register receipts-- $878 was missing.
412	00:30:27	00:30:29	Somebody came out ahead.
413	00:30:29	00:30:30	Inside guy?
414	00:30:30	00:30:32	Well, I'll run the employees.
415	00:30:32	00:30:35	Maybe somebody's got a record.
416	00:30:46	00:30:49	Ran your paint chips through PPG and DuPont.
417	00:30:49	00:30:50	Got a hit.
418	00:30:50	00:30:52	Aegean blue Honda Accord.
419	00:30:52	00:30:54	Popular color.
420	00:30:54	00:30:55	They carried it over for four years.
421	00:30:55	00:30:56	Go figure.
422	00:30:57	00:30:59	I'm a teal man myself.
423	00:30:59	00:31:01	You?
424	00:31:03	00:31:05	Stupid question.
425	00:31:05	00:31:08	Anyway, model years '84 to '87.
426	00:31:08	00:31:10	I'll put out a broadcast.
427	00:31:10	00:31:11	Thanks, Hodges.
428	00:31:11	00:31:12	Sure.
429	00:31:18	00:31:21	Before this goes any deeper, I want to hear it from you.
430	00:31:22	00:31:24	Are you going to try to screw me on this?
431	00:31:28	00:31:30	Well?
432	00:31:30	00:31:34	I guess it depends on whether I get stuck in traffic on the way to your hearing.
433	00:31:45	00:31:48	So, this car was reported stolen about, uh, oh, about three weeks ago.
434	00:31:49	00:31:50	Why don't you take the front.
435	00:31:50	00:31:53	I'll take the back.
436	00:32:28	00:32:31	pH 13. Sodium hydroxide.
437	00:32:42	00:32:45	Got a cell phone.
438	00:32:45	00:32:47	There's a lot of scung on it.
439	00:32:47	00:32:52	Won't be too good for prints, but let me check the call history.
440	00:32:55	00:32:57	Same number keeps popping up.
441	00:33:03	00:33:06	Best Bargain is temporarily closed.
442	00:33:06	00:33:08	Please check back tomorrow.
443	00:33:08	00:33:11	Well, this is interesting.
444	00:33:11	00:33:17	Before the robbery went down, somebody at the store was very eager to talk to our suspects.
445	00:33:18	00:33:19	Same number.
446	00:33:19	00:33:20	Yeah?
447	00:33:21	00:33:23	Maybe he can tell us who.
448	00:33:28	00:33:29	Todd Hallickey.
449	00:33:29	00:33:34	Look, I don't know why you guys brought me here, but you got no right tossing my apartment.
450	00:33:34	00:33:39	We matched your prints from a stolen car off the prints from a prior car theft, and bingo, we had a match.
451	00:33:39	00:33:41	Got a warrant for your apartment.
452	00:33:42	00:33:44	I don't boost cars no more.
453	00:33:44	00:33:46	Yeah, right.
454	00:33:47	00:33:48	Oh, wait. No, I...
455	00:33:48	00:33:53	I was looking into getting some wheels a couple of weeks ago.
456	00:33:53	00:33:57	I test-drove this old Honda Accord this guy was trying to unload.
457	00:33:57	00:34:02	An '86 Aegean blue with matching velour interior?
458	00:34:02	00:34:03	Yeah, that was it.
459	00:34:03	00:34:05	Must be how my print got there.
460	00:34:06	00:34:08	Didn't buy the car.
461	00:34:08	00:34:10	Guy seemed kind of shady.
462	00:34:10	00:34:15	You wouldn't happen to remember this shady guy's name, would you?
463	00:34:15	00:34:16	Come on.
464	00:34:16	00:34:19	No one keeps track of stuff like that.
465	00:34:19	00:34:21	Right.
466	00:34:22	00:34:25	You own any firearms, Mr. Hallickey?
467	00:34:25	00:34:26	No, sir, I'm on parole.
468	00:34:27	00:34:30	Besides, I don't believe in guns.
469	00:34:30	00:34:32	They're dangerous.
470	00:34:32	00:34:34	You know, that's a nasty injury you got there, Todd.
471	00:34:34	00:34:36	Looks kind of painful.
472	00:34:36	00:34:37	How'd you get it?
473	00:34:37	00:34:38	It's a rash.
474	00:34:38	00:34:41	Looks like a chemical burn to me.
475	00:34:41	00:34:43	You know what sodium hydroxide is?
476	00:34:43	00:34:45	Never heard of it.
477	00:34:45	00:34:47	It's the active ingredient in drain cleaner.
478	00:34:47	00:34:51	It opens up the pipes, dissolves flesh and fabrics.
479	00:34:57	00:35:02	Look, you want to pin that car on me, you go ahead and try.
480	00:35:02	00:35:05	I got this off the jacket from your apartment.
481	00:35:05	00:35:07	What the hell is this?
482	00:35:07	00:35:08	It's a bullet wipe.
483	00:35:08	00:35:11	A test for lead.
484	00:35:14	00:35:16	Congratulations.
485	00:35:16	00:35:18	You passed.
486	00:35:22	00:35:25	Hallickey's got no connection to the grocery store.
487	00:35:25	00:35:26	He was just the wheel man.
488	00:35:26	00:35:28	Still, he's looking at four counts of felony murder.
489	00:35:28	00:35:30	But he's not talking. He lawyered up.
490	00:35:31	00:35:32	We got a bullet hole in a jacket.
491	00:35:32	00:35:34	That's not even enough to prove that he was in the store.
492	00:35:35	00:35:35	What about the cash?
493	00:35:36	00:35:36	It wasn't in his apartment.
494	00:35:37	00:35:38	Maybe somebody else took it.
495	00:35:39	00:35:40	Almost $900 in small bills?
496	00:35:40	00:35:43	We'd have noticed pockets bulging with a wad like that.
497	00:35:43	00:35:46	What about the calls from the grocery store to the suspect's cell?
498	00:35:47	00:35:49	That could have been somebody giving the go signal.
499	00:35:49	00:35:50	There's no way to tell who.
500	00:35:50	00:35:56	The store runs off of an old PBX system, and every call that comes in goes back to the same number.
501	00:35:56	00:35:59	Every employee was near a phone, so, it could have been anybody.
502	00:35:59	00:36:00	Hey, y'all.
503	00:36:00	00:36:02	Ran the criminal records for the employees.
504	00:36:02	00:36:04	Came up with a Raul Valdez.
505	00:36:04	00:36:05	Freight loader.
506	00:36:05	00:36:07	He clocked in for work that night.
507	00:36:07	00:36:09	Never clocked out.
508	00:36:10	00:36:13	No one by that name interviewed at the scene?
509	00:36:14	00:36:15	Here's the kicker.
510	00:36:15	00:36:17	A few years ago, he spent some time in prison.
511	00:36:17	00:36:18	Lompoc.
512	00:36:18	00:36:22	So, Brass is trying to find him now.
513	00:37:06	00:37:07	I got to change my pants.
514	00:37:33	00:37:37	You left something in the store besides a urine stain.
515	00:37:40	00:37:42	Just a little too tempting, huh?
516	00:37:42	00:37:46	All that cash just sitting there right in front of your face...
517	00:37:52	00:37:57	Look, I go to that store to bag groceries, not to get my ass shot off.
518	00:37:57	00:38:00	I figure I earned the money.
519	00:38:00	00:38:01	Kind of like working overtime.
520	00:38:01	00:38:03	Might as well get something for all your trouble, right?
521	00:38:04	00:38:07	Considering the fact that your nice little robbery had gone straight to hell.
522	00:38:07	00:38:08	Whoa, wait a minute.
523	00:38:08	00:38:09	You think...?
524	00:38:09	00:38:11	No way.
525	00:38:11	00:38:12	It was an inside job.
526	00:38:12	00:38:14	You knew the registers were full.
527	00:38:14	00:38:17	Those gunmen had help from an employee.
528	00:38:17	00:38:18	Not from me, they didn't.
529	00:38:18	00:38:23	Look, you want to bust me for the money, go ahead, I took it.
530	00:38:23	00:38:25	But I did not set the thing up.
531	00:38:37	00:38:41	You know, Hodges already analyzed trace on the bullets.
532	00:38:41	00:38:43	Yeah, I wanted to take a look myself.
533	00:38:43	00:38:45	He'll take it personally.
534	00:38:45	00:38:46	Good.
535	00:38:50	00:38:56	The report says that the cocktail waitress was wearing a black wool sweater.
536	00:38:56	00:39:00	Was she also wearing something polyester?
537	00:39:00	00:39:02	No.
538	00:39:02	00:39:04	Take a look at this.
539	00:39:09	00:39:11	Black fibers.
540	00:39:11	00:39:13	Probably synthetic.
541	00:39:14	00:39:16	Mixed in with the wool.
542	00:39:18	00:39:23	If their gunman was wearing a black polyester jacket...
543	00:39:23	00:39:27	Fromansky claims that he was tunnel-visioned on the gunman.
544	00:39:27	00:39:33	So, it's possible that he never even saw the cocktail waitress.
545	00:39:49	00:39:52	You may have just saved Fromansky's ass.
546	00:39:54	00:39:56	Hey, Catherine, how'd it go with the bag boy?
547	00:39:56	00:40:00	He admitted to swiping the cash, but he wouldn't cop to the robbery.
548	00:40:00	00:40:02	Then I have something you should see.
549	00:40:02	00:40:10	I was going back through the surveillance tapes covering the loading dock, thinking I might find someone scouting a blind spot, you know?
550	00:40:10	00:40:13	But instead, I found this.
551	00:40:13	00:40:17	Two nights before the robbery.
552	00:40:17	00:40:20	There.
553	00:40:20	00:40:21	See that?
554	00:40:21	00:40:23	One more time.
555	00:40:26	00:40:30	That camera's stationary, so...
556	00:40:30	00:40:33	Somebody moved the camera.
557	00:40:35	00:40:38	You used to part-time at the Forum shops.
558	00:40:38	00:40:40	We got your prints off your work card.
559	00:40:41	00:40:45	It was the same print that we got off the loading dock surveillance camera.
560	00:40:52	00:40:57	Raul Valdez, an ex-con-- your co-worker.
561	00:40:57	00:41:01	You got him to give you the names of some guys to do the job.
562	00:41:01	00:41:05	You give them the best time to hit the registers.
563	00:41:05	00:41:08	You tell them where to park.
564	00:41:08	00:41:10	It's a good plan.
565	00:41:10	00:41:14	Until your ex showed up and leaves you with your kid.
566	00:41:14	00:41:19	Then you panic, and you call your guys, try to call it off, but they won't listen.
567	00:41:19	00:41:23	If that's what happened, that could go in your favor.
568	00:41:24	00:41:26	When we find Raul, he'll give you up in a heartbeat.
569	00:41:26	00:41:29	I think I need to get a lawyer.
570	00:41:29	00:41:32	What you need is come clean and cooperate.
571	00:41:32	00:41:38	And you better hope and pray the DA doesn't want to put a needle in your arm for killing five people, including a cop.
572	00:41:43	00:41:48	I have been working at that store for five years.
573	00:41:48	00:41:51	38 hours a week.
574	00:41:51	00:41:56	38... not 40.
575	00:41:56	00:41:58	You know why?
576	00:41:58	00:42:05	Because my manager won't give me enough hours to qualify for benefits.
577	00:42:09	00:42:11	I have a kid...
578	00:42:11	00:42:14	with rotten teeth.
579	00:42:19	00:42:22	I never meant for anybody to get hurt.
580	00:42:31	00:42:35	Officer Fromansky, if you could smile, please?
581	00:42:35	00:42:36	Thank you; right over here.
582	00:42:36	00:42:38	Guy from the mayor's office.
583	00:42:38	00:42:40	Fromansky's getting a commendation.
584	00:42:40	00:42:42	What do you think?
585	00:42:42	00:42:46	Two dead felons, two dead civilians a dead policeman...
586	00:42:46	00:42:48	I don't know what to think.
