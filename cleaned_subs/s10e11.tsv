0	00:00:10	00:00:11	Control, Air 12.
1	00:00:11	00:00:13	I'm Code Four.
2	00:00:13	00:00:15	Another quiet night in the wilderness.
3	00:00:15	00:00:18	Nothing stirring but a pack of coyotes.
4	00:00:18	00:00:20	Copy, Air 12.
5	00:00:24	00:00:26	Whoa. Looks like they've got company.
6	00:00:26	00:00:27	Stand by, One.
7	00:00:30	00:00:32	I have a visual.
8	00:00:37	00:00:38	Bogey in a blue pickup.
9	00:00:39	00:00:40	Half mile west of Quadrant Six.
10	00:00:40	00:00:41	Copy, Air 12.
11	00:00:41	00:00:42	I'll alert ground units.
12	00:00:45	00:00:47	Suspect vehicle westbound on Paiute Logging Road.
13	00:00:47	00:00:49	Suspect doubling back, doubling back.
14	00:00:49	00:00:51	Eastbound, Paiute Logging Road.
15	00:00:51	00:00:53	Two ground units approaching.
16	00:00:54	00:00:57	Suspect turning southbound. Suspect turning south.
17	00:00:57	00:00:58	Copy, Air 12.
18	00:01:06	00:01:07	Subject heading westbound.
19	00:01:07	00:01:08	Subject heading westbound.
20	00:01:08	00:01:10	Park rangers have a visual.
21	00:01:10	00:01:13	They're in pursuit.
22	00:01:29	00:01:31	Suspect vehicle crashed.
23	00:01:31	00:01:33	He's on foot.
24	00:01:36	00:01:39	Control, situation is Code Four.
25	00:01:42	00:01:44	Park service notified us.
26	00:01:44	00:01:46	This is a federal wildlife refuge.
27	00:01:47	00:01:48	Nobody should be out here.
28	00:01:48	00:01:51	That's Juan Ramirez, suspect, Boulder City.
29	00:01:51	00:01:53	Buenas noches, Juan.
30	00:01:53	00:01:55	What was he doing out here?
31	00:01:55	00:01:59	He was dumping trash, which is what you guys are here for.
32	00:02:16	00:02:18	Surgical waste?!
33	00:02:32	00:02:34	And human organs.
34	00:02:34	00:02:39	Spleen, gallbladder and a finger.
35	00:02:39	00:02:42	And these cuts-- they're surgically precise.
36	00:02:42	00:02:45	Hey, guys, we need a tarp on the ground over here, please.
37	00:02:51	00:02:53	Nick.
38	00:02:57	00:02:59	It's just a kid.
39	00:03:01	00:03:03	Betadine.
40	00:03:03	00:03:04	This boy was prepped for surgery.
41	00:03:04	00:03:08	What are the chances there's another guy in Vegas cutting out human organs on the DL?
42	00:03:08	00:03:10	No, this is Dr. Jekyll's work.
43	00:03:11	00:03:14	I never would've expected him to look like Juan.
44	00:03:14	00:03:15	Nah.
45	00:03:15	00:03:17	That's not him.
46	00:03:17	00:03:20	Hey, Dr. Frankenstein had Igor.
47	00:03:20	00:03:23	Maybe Dr. Jekyll has Juan.
48	00:04:01	00:04:04	00 a.m.
49	00:04:04	00:04:08	There's no cameras in the hallway, and I'm waiting on the elevator surveillance.
50	00:04:08	00:04:09	What about the stairs?
51	00:04:09	00:04:15	Well, hotel security tells me that the door monitoring system hasn't been triggered in the last 12 hours.
52	00:04:15	00:04:16	David.
53	00:04:16	00:04:17	What have you got?
54	00:04:17	00:04:23	White marks on the neck, but they don't go all the way around, and there's no indentations on the skin.
55	00:04:23	00:04:25	Means she probably wasn't strangled.
56	00:04:25	00:04:27	Possible asphyxiation. Possible.
57	00:04:28	00:04:30	We have no abrasions on her legs.
58	00:04:32	00:04:34	Nothing on her back.
59	00:04:34	00:04:36	She must have been dead when the killer dragged her out here.
60	00:04:36	00:04:39	Which means she was probably killed in a room on this floor.
61	00:04:39	00:04:41	Here's her purse.
62	00:04:43	00:04:44	Smooth skin.
63	00:04:44	00:04:47	Very little body hair.
64	00:04:47	00:04:49	Makes her a perfect candidate for Super Glue.
65	00:04:49	00:04:51	Call Robbins, have him turn the thermostat down in autopsy.
66	00:04:51	00:04:53	And, David, get the body back stat.
67	00:04:53	00:04:54	Disturb her as little as possible.
68	00:04:54	00:04:57	I'll leave her clothes on.
69	00:04:57	00:04:58	Hey, Don, it's Greg.
70	00:04:58	00:05:00	Karen Jones.
71	00:05:00	00:05:02	23 from Phoenix.
72	00:05:02	00:05:04	Yeah, hi, this is Captain Brass. I'm upstairs.
73	00:05:04	00:05:08	Do you have a Karen Jones registered as a hotel guest?
74	00:05:08	00:05:09	No, sir,we don't. Thank you.
75	00:05:09	00:05:11	She's not registered.
76	00:05:13	00:05:16	This might be.
77	00:05:42	00:05:48	Fluoxetine, atorvastatin calcium and Prevalis.
78	00:05:48	00:05:53	And this shipping order for herbs and vitamins from a store called Botanica Ventura.
79	00:05:53	00:05:56	You want to bet that Botanica sells more than just herbs?
80	00:05:56	00:05:57	That's a good bet.
81	00:05:57	00:05:59	What about this blood?
82	00:06:02	00:06:03	It's human.
83	00:06:03	00:06:05	The fresh drops are still gummy.
84	00:06:06	00:06:08	Older ones are flaky.
85	00:06:08	00:06:10	Multiple events.
86	00:06:10	00:06:13	This wasn't Igor's first trash run.
87	00:06:17	00:06:18	Excuse me.
88	00:06:19	00:06:21	Did either of you hear or see anything last night?
89	00:06:36	00:06:38	Uh, just get a Japanese officer over here to F.I. them.
90	00:06:38	00:06:41	Thank you. Arigato.
91	00:06:41	00:06:43	So you haven't slept last night?
92	00:06:43	00:06:45	I don't know... Where did those come from?
93	00:06:45	00:06:49	I-I-I mean, I think I remember some, like, stripper chicks, like, trying to grind up on me, you know?
94	00:06:49	00:06:51	I don't know, dude.
95	00:06:51	00:06:52	I was so faded.
96	00:06:54	00:06:55	I think I'm still drunk.
97	00:06:55	00:07:01	All right, dude, well, we need to get your statement, but first, you need to brush your teeth.
98	00:07:01	00:07:02	Mr. Crowley, just calm down.
99	00:07:02	00:07:04	I'm going to miss my plane.
100	00:07:04	00:07:05	So you're not spending the weekend?
101	00:07:05	00:07:06	I'm an actuary.
102	00:07:06	00:07:08	It was our annual meeting.
103	00:07:08	00:07:09	Where were you last night?
104	00:07:09	00:07:12	A group of us went to dinner and a show.
105	00:07:12	00:07:13	(phone rings) I'm going to need their names.
106	00:07:13	00:07:15	Well, keep knocking on doors, 'cause we're all on this floor.
107	00:07:15	00:07:17	Thank you for your help.
108	00:07:17	00:07:20	Jim, I'm getting a lot of no answers.
109	00:07:21	00:07:24	So get a list of all the guests on 19 including checkouts.
110	00:07:24	00:07:26	Yeah, I'm on it.
111	00:07:26	00:07:28	We've been showing Karen Jones' picture around everywhere.
112	00:07:28	00:07:30	Somebody had to see her.
113	00:07:30	00:07:32	Listen, something may be breaking now. I'll get back to you.
114	00:07:32	00:07:33	What do you got, Joe?
115	00:07:34	00:07:35	Bartender recognized the photo.
116	00:07:35	00:07:37	She was here last two nights with a girlfriend.
117	00:07:37	00:07:38	With a prostitute girlfriend?
118	00:07:38	00:07:43	Hard to tell, but they had guys dripping off them so if they were working girls, they were off duty.
119	00:07:43	00:07:44	Can you describe the other woman?
120	00:07:44	00:07:46	Smoking body. Brunette.
121	00:07:46	00:07:48	I don't remember names. Sorry.
122	00:07:49	00:07:51	But I do remember that last night, the girls got into it.
123	00:07:51	00:07:52	What do you mean?
124	00:07:52	00:07:55	Well, the blonde asked me to quit serving the brunette; got a little heated.
125	00:07:55	00:07:58	Have to say, the girl-fight-- kind of hot.
126	00:07:58	00:08:00	Okay. All right, thanks, thanks.
127	00:08:14	00:08:17	We got no eyewitnesses on 19.
128	00:08:17	00:08:19	Found some white fibers in her nostril.
129	00:08:19	00:08:22	Hotel's bedding and towels were all white.
130	00:08:22	00:08:26	Maybe the killer used what was available to suffocate her.
131	00:08:26	00:08:28	68 on the extremities.
132	00:08:31	00:08:33	70 on the abs.
133	00:08:33	00:08:34	She's chill.
134	00:08:37	00:08:40	All right, that's our test print.
135	00:08:46	00:08:48	Let's go camping.
136	00:09:42	00:09:44	Cansado estoy de esto.
137	00:09:44	00:09:46	Cansado y sabes que estas mentiendo.
138	00:09:46	00:09:48	Estas mentiendo!
139	00:09:48	00:09:49	¿Que estaba haciendo en la montaña, pues?
140	00:09:49	00:09:51	¿Que estaba haciendo allá?
141	00:09:51	00:09:53	¿Ah? Tenemos la basura!
142	00:09:53	00:09:55	Y para salir de aqui...
143	00:09:55	00:09:56	hay que hablar!
144	00:09:58	00:10:02	Some guy paid me to take the trash out there.
145	00:10:02	00:10:04	Which guy?
146	00:10:04	00:10:05	I don't know.
147	00:10:05	00:10:10	I-I was in the parking lot on Turkson... looking for work.
148	00:10:10	00:10:15	Guy comes up, gives me $20 if I take the trash up in the mountains and bury it.
149	00:10:15	00:10:17	Who killed that little boy?
150	00:10:18	00:10:20	Did you do it?
151	00:10:20	00:10:22	You like little boys, huh?
152	00:10:22	00:10:27	You know what happens to guys like you in la prisión, hmm?
153	00:10:29	00:10:31	Give me a name!
154	00:10:33	00:10:36	El doctor.
155	00:10:49	00:10:51	He's talking to you, isn't he?
156	00:10:52	00:10:55	Yes.
157	00:10:55	00:10:58	Sometimes I wish they would tell me more.
158	00:10:58	00:11:00	Sometimes I wish they'd just shut up.
159	00:11:00	00:11:01	What are you hearing?
160	00:11:01	00:11:10	Well, the blood in his nostrils and the petechial dots on his skin tell me that he was some kind of bleeder.
161	00:11:10	00:11:18	His hands are raw from detergents or cleansers of some kind-- tells me he worked hard.
162	00:11:18	00:11:23	And his teeth, see, they're worn down by grinding.
163	00:11:23	00:11:28	Tells me he was probably in constant pain, but I don't think it was a problem with the spleen.
164	00:11:28	00:11:30	You nailed it.
165	00:11:30	00:11:32	The splenectomy was a last-ditch effort to save his life.
166	00:11:32	00:11:37	The purpose of this surgery was to remove this.
167	00:11:37	00:11:38	Supersized cyst.
168	00:11:38	00:11:40	It was still in situ.
169	00:11:40	00:11:46	Which means the surgeon was unable to remove it because he was a bleeder.
170	00:11:46	00:11:50	Histology showed disseminated platelet-fibrin and microvascular thrombi.
171	00:11:50	00:11:54	Idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura.
172	00:11:54	00:11:59	This boy's immune system was destroying his blood platelets, inhibiting clotting.
173	00:11:59	00:12:05	So the moment the incision was made, the bleeding would have been unstoppable and the surgeon probably panicked.
174	00:12:05	00:12:13	And because platelet destruction occurs in the spleen, the surgeon would have hoped once it was removed, new platelets would form and his blood would start clotting again.
175	00:12:15	00:12:20	Four months ago, our Dr. Jekyll made a bow tie with Joey Bigelow's intestines.
176	00:12:22	00:12:28	A month ago, he implanted a superfluous appendix into Bernard Higgins.
177	00:12:28	00:12:31	Cystectomy and splenectomy are...
178	00:12:31	00:12:34	routine procedures.
179	00:12:34	00:12:40	If he did this, he's not limiting himself to perversity.
180	00:12:40	00:12:44	He's operating both inside and outside the norm.
181	00:12:44	00:12:45	A true Jekyll and Hyde.
182	00:12:50	00:12:52	I went through all the camera footage from the casino bar.
183	00:12:53	00:12:56	Karen Jones and her friend got there 00 last night.
184	00:12:58	00:12:59	Sequined dress, silver stilettos.
185	00:12:59	00:13:01	What about all these guys?
186	00:13:01	00:13:04	Lots of approaches, no landings.
187	00:13:04	00:13:05	The bartender was right.
188	00:13:05	00:13:08	There was an altercation between the girls.
189	00:13:08	00:13:10	Nothing to write Penthouse about.
190	00:13:10	00:13:14	Picked up Karen at a casino ATM camera about an hour later.
191	00:13:14	00:13:16	She's working him.
192	00:13:16	00:13:17	He's not interested.
193	00:13:17	00:13:20	Probably didn't want to pay for it.
194	00:13:20	00:13:21	Can't blame a girl for trying, though.
195	00:13:21	00:13:23	He's obviously got cash.
196	00:13:23	00:13:28	Exit camera picked her up 37 p.m. solo.
197	00:13:28	00:13:29	What time did she come back?
198	00:13:29	00:13:31	30 a.m.
199	00:13:31	00:13:35	Got her going up the elevator 33, in a hurry.
200	00:13:35	00:13:37	Got off on 19.
201	00:13:37	00:13:39	So her john had to be on that floor.
202	00:13:39	00:13:41	Probably checked out by now.
203	00:13:41	00:13:45	So what we need to do is find that girl in the blue dress.
204	00:13:45	00:13:48	Have Brass show her picture around.
205	00:13:48	00:13:50	(PDA beeping) My body's done.
206	00:13:50	00:13:52	Smurf's up.
207	00:15:39	00:15:41	So what do we have on the pickup truck?
208	00:15:41	00:15:43	First priority is an I.D. on the bleeder.
209	00:15:43	00:15:46	Now, he wasn't in CODIS, but I did get a familial hit.
210	00:15:47	00:15:48	This is Carlos Gomez.
211	00:15:48	00:15:54	He's doing time for assault, and he I.D.'d the victim's autopsy photo as his son Eduardo.
212	00:15:54	00:15:59	It turns out Eduardo was working as a night janitor at a motel on Bonanza and Albert.
213	00:15:59	00:16:02	That's only a couple of blocks from where Joey Bigelow was found.
214	00:16:02	00:16:04	Anything on the body parts or blood evidence?
215	00:16:04	00:16:06	Well, the spleen was the victim's.
216	00:16:06	00:16:10	The gallbladder and the fingers were from unrelated donors.
217	00:16:10	00:16:12	And as far as the rest, I'm working on it.
218	00:16:12	00:16:14	What about the surgical evidence we found in the trash bags?
219	00:16:14	00:16:18	The syringes all contained 2% lidocaine solution.
220	00:16:18	00:16:19	Local anesthetic for minor surgeries.
221	00:16:19	00:16:27	And analysis of the tubing confirmed intravenous diazepam-- a Schedule IV Controlled Substance; probably used to twilight patients.
222	00:16:27	00:16:32	All the empty bottles of pharmaceuticals were from Mexico; prescription-only, here and there.
223	00:16:32	00:16:35	So maybe Dr. Jekyll has a Mexico connection.
224	00:16:35	00:16:37	Yeah, it could be this Botanica Ventura place.
225	00:16:37	00:16:38	What do we know about it?
226	00:16:38	00:16:40	It's a storefront leased by a guy named Jeffrey Hughes.
227	00:16:40	00:16:44	Now there were good clean prints on those drug bottles, I just can't confirm they're his.
228	00:16:44	00:16:46	No AFIS hits.
229	00:16:46	00:16:47	So we're gonna go check him out. Warrant's on its way.
230	00:16:47	00:16:49	I want to be there.
231	00:17:06	00:17:08	You two stay here.
232	00:17:08	00:17:09	You two come with me.
233	00:17:10	00:17:11	¿Allá?
234	00:17:11	00:17:13	¿Aqui, ah?
235	00:17:19	00:17:21	Jeffrey Hughes?
236	00:17:21	00:17:22	Yes?
237	00:17:22	00:17:25	Yeah, we have a warrant to search the premises.
238	00:17:25	00:17:28	So if everybody could please get up.
239	00:17:28	00:17:29	Afuera, por favor!
240	00:17:29	00:17:31	¿Que debo hacer, doctor?
241	00:17:32	00:17:33	Yo me encargo de esto.
242	00:17:33	00:17:35	El doctor.
243	00:17:35	00:17:37	I'm not a doctor. I'm an herbalist.
244	00:17:37	00:17:40	All we sell is herbs, vitamins, supplements.
245	00:17:40	00:17:42	Does that include prescription drugs?
246	00:17:42	00:17:44	You've seen my customers.
247	00:17:44	00:17:46	Their ancestors were the Maya.
248	00:17:46	00:17:53	The Mayans believe that wellness resides in a balance of body and spirit; man and God.
249	00:17:53	00:17:55	We're not here for a history lesson.
250	00:17:55	00:17:58	Man has always been imperfect.
251	00:18:00	00:18:02	I do what I can.
252	00:18:03	00:18:05	That warrant includes your prints.
253	00:18:05	00:18:06	I'd like to take those now.
254	00:18:06	00:18:09	Give me your hand, please.
255	00:18:09	00:18:14	Does doing all that you can include procedures or surgeries?
256	00:18:14	00:18:17	Like I said, I am not a doctor.
257	00:18:21	00:18:23	What's back there?
258	00:18:26	00:18:29	Just a storeroom.
259	00:18:32	00:18:35	Mr. Hughes, your prints were found on crime scene evidence.
260	00:18:35	00:18:36	You're under arrest.
261	00:18:36	00:18:37	Come with me.
262	00:18:38	00:18:40	Escort this young lady to a car, as well.
263	00:18:55	00:18:56	No table.
264	00:18:56	00:18:58	No surgical equipment lying around.
265	00:18:58	00:19:03	Suppose it would've been easier if we'd walked in and found a laparoscope. Hmm.
266	00:19:03	00:19:05	But Dr. Jekyll or no, he had to have some tools.
267	00:19:05	00:19:08	We'll get a warrant for his house.
268	00:19:08	00:19:10	Eduardo Gomez lost a lot of blood.
269	00:19:10	00:19:16	If there was an operating table in here, it would have been in the middle of the room.
270	00:19:20	00:19:23	And he would have needed some light.
271	00:19:27	00:19:29	All right, that's bright enough for surgery.
272	00:19:29	00:19:33	The boy's blood would've dripped down here off the table.
273	00:19:33	00:19:35	Could've used bleach to clean it up.
274	00:19:35	00:19:37	Bleach only cleans the surface.
275	00:19:37	00:19:39	Unless you really saturate it, it's not gonna get down to the grout.
276	00:19:39	00:19:45	Nick, the grout in these two areas is two different shades.
277	00:20:10	00:20:13	Yep, the tiles on this floor have been regrouted, Nick.
278	00:20:15	00:20:17	The difference is subtle, but I can feel it.
279	00:20:17	00:20:21	Well, I can only think of one reason you'd bleach and regrout.
280	00:20:21	00:20:23	We have blood.
281	00:20:24	00:20:28	If it belonged to Eduardo Gomez...
282	00:20:28	00:20:30	it means he died here.
283	00:20:30	00:20:35	Karen Jones' bank account shows that she paid for three nights, using her debit card.
284	00:20:35	00:20:36	Anybody with her?
285	00:20:36	00:20:38	No. She checked in two nights ago.
286	00:20:38	00:20:40	She was alone. What do you got?
287	00:20:40	00:20:41	Room's all clear, Captain.
288	00:20:45	00:20:48	Not bad for Fremont Street.
289	00:20:48	00:20:51	Got some luggage.
290	00:20:51	00:20:54	Looks like she didn't check out.
291	00:21:01	00:21:03	Do you smell that?
292	00:21:03	00:21:06	Hasn't ripened into decomp yet.
293	00:21:49	00:21:50	The girl in the blue dress.
294	00:21:50	00:21:53	She's definitely not sleeping it off.
295	00:22:43	00:22:45	Hey, Catherine.
296	00:22:45	00:22:52	I found two suitcases in Karen Jones' motel room, and one of them belongs to a...
297	00:22:52	00:22:54	Jillian Rose from Phoenix.
298	00:22:54	00:22:56	Gotta be the girl in the blue dress.
299	00:22:56	00:22:59	Great. Have Brass run her.
300	00:23:00	00:23:02	Meet Jillian Rose.
301	00:23:02	00:23:05	Oh. Ms. Rose has got quite a few contusions.
302	00:23:05	00:23:07	Yeah. Defensive wounds.
303	00:23:08	00:23:10	Nasty lump on her forehead.
304	00:23:10	00:23:14	No internal hemorrhaging, not fatal but probably happened during the struggle.
305	00:23:14	00:23:15	What's C.O.D.?
306	00:23:15	00:23:19	Petechial hemorrhaging in the eyes and lips...
307	00:23:19	00:23:21	white marks, but...
308	00:23:21	00:23:22	no indentations in the neck.
309	00:23:23	00:23:25	Just like her friend-- she was asphyxiated.
310	00:23:25	00:23:28	Uh, didn't find any trace in her nose or esophagus.
311	00:23:28	00:23:32	She was suffocated before she was put into that box spring.
312	00:23:32	00:23:33	Any indication what time she died?
313	00:23:34	00:23:38	Sometime between midnight 00 a.m.
314	00:23:38	00:23:46	Karen Jones and Jillian Rose, friends from the same town, sharing the same room, killed in a similar manner around the same time.
315	00:23:46	00:23:49	But their bodies were found in two different locations.
316	00:23:49	00:23:50	Are we looking for two killers?
317	00:23:51	00:23:53	My gut says that we're not.
318	00:23:53	00:23:57	Well, if just one guy did this, she had to have been killed first.
319	00:24:00	00:24:04	So the blood in the truck bed and the trash bags came from multiple donors, both male and female.
320	00:24:04	00:24:06	Including Eduardo Gomez?
321	00:24:06	00:24:10	And you were right-- that was his blood in the grout.
322	00:24:13	00:24:16	But I also found a second contributor in the grout sample.
323	00:24:16	00:24:18	It was an unknown male.
324	00:24:18	00:24:19	They're probably my epithelials.
325	00:24:19	00:24:22	I had to palpate the grout-- you can't do that with gloves on.
326	00:24:22	00:24:26	Well, in that case, I just need a sample of your DNA, and I will exclude you.
327	00:24:26	00:24:29	My DNA-- which would go into a database.
328	00:24:29	00:24:33	Your fingerprints are already in AFIS-- what's the difference?
329	00:24:33	00:24:35	There's a big difference.
330	00:24:35	00:24:39	You're gonna have to put in your report that I said no.
331	00:24:56	00:24:58	Mrs. Hughes.
332	00:24:58	00:25:01	We have a warrant to search the premises.
333	00:25:20	00:25:25	All right, Mr. Hughes, Eduardo Gomez died in your operating room.
334	00:25:25	00:25:27	I don't have an operating room.
335	00:25:27	00:25:29	But you knew him.
336	00:25:29	00:25:30	I knew his whole family.
337	00:25:30	00:25:32	His mother was a loyal customer.
338	00:25:32	00:25:37	Did you tell his mother that you dumped him with the rest of the trash from your other surgeries?
339	00:25:37	00:25:39	I mean, it must have been a busy night.
340	00:25:39	00:25:48	You, um, removed a gallbladder; you amputated a gangrenous finger; you attempted to remove Eduardo's abdominal cyst.
341	00:25:48	00:25:51	So tell me, where did you train, Doctor?
342	00:25:53	00:26:01	I graduated premed at Harvard, and celebrated in Cozumel, where I fell in love with a local girl.
343	00:26:02	00:26:07	So I, uh, went to medical school in Guadalajara and trained at a hospital in Monterey.
344	00:26:08	00:26:12	And are you licensed to practice in the United States?
345	00:26:12	00:26:13	You know the answer to that.
346	00:26:14	00:26:15	Yes, I do.
347	00:26:15	00:26:22	So you were smuggling drugs, you were practicing without a license in unsafe conditions, all of which cost Eduardo Gomez his life.
348	00:26:22	00:26:24	I was trying to save his life!
349	00:26:24	00:26:28	He is the sole support of his mother and his newborn sister.
350	00:26:28	00:26:30	They're here without documentation.
351	00:26:30	00:26:31	No insurance.
352	00:26:31	00:26:35	He was in so much pain, he couldn't travel to Mexico for surgery.
353	00:26:35	00:26:39	I couldn't turn him away. Eduardo presented with obvious signs of ITP.
354	00:26:39	00:26:41	I misdiagnosed.
355	00:26:41	00:26:43	By the time I knew what was going on, it was too late.
356	00:26:43	00:26:45	His mother was there.
357	00:26:45	00:26:47	She made the decision to dispose of the body.
358	00:26:47	00:26:48	She doesn't blame me.
359	00:26:48	00:26:51	I delivered her baby!
360	00:26:51	00:26:53	Her perfectly healthy infant.
361	00:26:53	00:26:56	Eduardo was the first patient ever to die in my care.
362	00:26:56	00:27:00	Well, what about Joey Bigelow and Bernard Higgins?
363	00:27:00	00:27:01	Hmm?
364	00:27:01	00:27:03	What about them?
365	00:27:04	00:27:07	I don't know these men.
366	00:27:09	00:27:11	This isn't medicine.
367	00:27:11	00:27:14	Look, I don't run a practice to get rich.
368	00:27:14	00:27:17	I... help those the system ignores.
369	00:27:17	00:27:23	The nanny whose gallbladder is inflamed, the gardener who risks his life for a gangrenous finger.
370	00:27:23	00:27:29	There are clinics, social services for that kind of thing. Reform health care all you want.
371	00:27:29	00:27:32	My patients are always gonna be left out.
372	00:27:39	00:27:45	Had the casino send over some more surveillance footage, this time tracking our second victim, Jillian Rose.
373	00:27:45	00:27:51	Started with Karen and Jillian at the bar, and I noticed something.
374	00:27:51	00:27:57	A few minutes after their little argument, Karen and Jillian went on the hunt-- separately.
375	00:28:01	00:28:03	That's when I found this.
376	00:28:06	00:28:09	Oh, she landed the ATM guy.
377	00:28:09	00:28:11	The one that Karen couldn't.
378	00:28:11	00:28:13	They got off on 19.
379	00:28:13	00:28:17	Six minutes later, she's texting, coming down.
380	00:28:17	00:28:19	That's not even enough time for a quickie.
381	00:28:19	00:28:25	And why would two hookers go after the same john?
382	00:28:25	00:28:28	'Cause maybe they aren't hookers.
383	00:28:28	00:28:32	And I don't think this is about sex.
384	00:29:05	00:29:07	Karen Jones and Jillian Rose were running a con.
385	00:29:07	00:29:10	One of them would steal the guy's PIN number, the other would steal his credit card.
386	00:29:10	00:29:12	Who am I looking at? Their mark.
387	00:29:12	00:29:17	That's Karen with him at the ATM, and an hour later, Jillian went up to his room on the 19th floor.
388	00:29:17	00:29:20	We never talked to him, so he's got to be one of the checkouts.
389	00:29:20	00:29:23	Let's go back to the Mediterranean.
390	00:29:26	00:29:29	So, the room is registered to Donald Fiore.
391	00:29:29	00:29:32	He works as an actuary; he's here for the convention.
392	00:29:32	00:29:34	The maid I.D.'d him from a photo.
393	00:29:34	00:29:36	She said she saw nothing unusual when she cleaned up, so...
394	00:29:36	00:29:40	We're only three doors down from where we found Karen Jones' body.
395	00:29:40	00:29:41	When did Fiore check out? Well, he didn't.
396	00:29:41	00:29:44	He left his key in the room, and the hotel automatically checks him out at noon.
397	00:29:44	00:29:48	Right, so he could've checked out anytime. Fiore lives in Salt Lake City-- I spoke to the local cops.
398	00:29:48	00:29:54	(phone rings) They said they'd keep an eye on him, but they weren't gonna arrest him until we provided them with more evidence.
399	00:29:54	00:29:55	I gotta take this. Good luck.
400	00:29:57	00:30:00	Brass. Talk to me. (door shuts) Okay. So...
401	00:30:00	00:30:07	the maid would have vacuumed, emptied the trash, cleaned the bathroom, changed the towels...
402	00:30:07	00:30:09	And the sheets, too.
403	00:30:09	00:30:11	Hotel laundry will all be commingled.
404	00:30:11	00:30:14	And if he threw her clothes in the trash, well...
405	00:30:14	00:30:23	that's like looking for a needle inside a stack of needles, so... what part of the room remains from guest to guest?
406	00:30:54	00:30:57	Looks like somebody messed with this vent.
407	00:31:08	00:31:10	Oh... Got a pair of shoes.
408	00:31:11	00:31:13	No dress, though.
409	00:31:15	00:31:17	Karen Jones...
410	00:31:17	00:31:19	had silver stilettos.
411	00:31:19	00:31:21	They're all wet.
412	00:31:21	00:31:24	I didn't see any condensation in the vent.
413	00:31:24	00:31:26	Heels have been snapped off.
414	00:31:26	00:31:29	And the soles are... are bent.
415	00:31:29	00:31:33	I mean... this didn't happen during the struggle.
416	00:31:38	00:31:40	He was trying to get rid of these.
417	00:32:10	00:32:13	He flushed the dress, but he couldn't get the shoes to go down.
418	00:32:27	00:32:32	If the dress is still in this pipe, then the toilet would be backed up.
419	00:32:32	00:32:35	And you know what rolls downhill.
420	00:32:39	00:32:42	Okay. We're ready.
421	00:33:11	00:33:12	Greg, stop.
422	00:33:12	00:33:14	We've got something.
423	00:33:15	00:33:17	How may feet of cable do you have out?
424	00:33:17	00:33:19	Uh, about 20.
425	00:33:19	00:33:21	About ten feet per floor.
426	00:33:21	00:33:22	So, that's...
427	00:33:22	00:33:24	Two floors below.
428	00:33:24	00:33:26	1721.
429	00:33:55	00:33:57	I think that's enough to compel a warrant.
430	00:34:03	00:34:07	I didn't realize I was set up until I was in the shower.
431	00:34:07	00:34:09	Oh, God, your body is unbelievable!
432	00:34:09	00:34:11	And you'll get to taste all of it. (moans)
433	00:34:11	00:34:13	As soon as you shower.
434	00:34:13	00:34:17	I'll be right here, thinking about what I'm going to do to you.
435	00:34:33	00:34:36	She stole my wallet.
436	00:34:36	00:34:37	I should have known.
437	00:34:37	00:34:38	She was...
438	00:34:39	00:34:40	too beautiful to be a hooker.
439	00:34:40	00:34:47	I called my bank, found out that they had used my credit card and PIN, took a $2,000 cash advance.
440	00:34:47	00:34:51	That's a $50 bank charge, accrues at 28% interest.
441	00:34:51	00:34:52	Why didn't you just report it?
442	00:34:52	00:35:00	Well, if I called the cops and you found them, then there would be reports saying that I had brought a girl back to my room, and I couldn't take the risk of my wife finding out.
443	00:35:00	00:35:03	She's an heiress.
444	00:35:03	00:35:05	Has all the money.
445	00:35:05	00:35:09	Simple cost-benefit analysis.
446	00:35:09	00:35:10	How does that analysis work?
447	00:35:10	00:35:12	Their lives for your wallet?
448	00:35:12	00:35:15	The solve rates for murders, for homicides in Clark County?
449	00:35:15	00:35:17	62%.
450	00:35:17	00:35:19	My wife finds out that I'm philandering?
451	00:35:19	00:35:22	That's a 100% chance of divorce.
452	00:35:22	00:35:27	But since you didn't cheat, you figured that she would be okay with you murdering Karen and Jillian?
453	00:35:27	00:35:29	I never saw Jillian again.
454	00:35:29	00:35:32	As far as her friend goes, she came looking for me.
455	00:35:37	00:35:38	You want it back? It's gonna cost you.
456	00:35:38	00:35:40	Just-Just give it to me, and I'll forget the whole thing.
457	00:35:40	00:35:42	I don't think so.
458	00:35:42	00:35:45	I saw that the safety was still on, so...
459	00:35:46	00:35:48	I took my chances.
460	00:35:48	00:35:53	Prostitutes are 60 to 100 times more likely to be murdered than non-prostitutes.
461	00:35:53	00:35:56	So I flushed the dress, and I pulled her out into the hallway.
462	00:35:56	00:36:00	I calculated the likelihood that you would think that she was a hooker and wouldn't be a priority.
463	00:36:00	00:36:01	You calculated wrong.
464	00:36:01	00:36:04	Regardless, I acted in self-defense.
465	00:36:04	00:36:05	Yeah, right up until you suffocated her.
466	00:36:05	00:36:16	Well, acquittal rates for self-defense claims are very high-- jurors tend to judge the motives of a beautiful con woman much more harshly than an overworked actuary.
467	00:36:56	00:36:57	Hodges.
468	00:36:57	00:36:58	Yeah?
469	00:36:58	00:37:01	I need you to tell me what this is.
470	00:37:03	00:37:04	Gray fibers.
471	00:37:04	00:37:07	Maybe a recycled synthetic.
472	00:37:10	00:37:11	Oh, yeah.
473	00:37:11	00:37:13	It's polyester polyfill fiber.
474	00:37:13	00:37:16	Commonly used in box spring padding.
475	00:37:16	00:37:19	Don't you have to do an FTIR to confirm that?
476	00:37:19	00:37:20	Just did one.
477	00:37:20	00:37:24	On your motel girl; the one stuffed into the box spring.
478	00:37:24	00:37:27	Are you saying this fiber is from the same box spring?
479	00:37:27	00:37:30	I'm just saying that it's the same type of material.
480	00:37:30	00:37:32	Your two victims shared the room.
481	00:37:32	00:37:35	What are the chances that it's not from that box spring?
482	00:37:37	00:37:41	Karen had to have come into contact with the box spring after it was cut open.
483	00:37:42	00:37:44	Which puts her in the room after Jillian was dead.
484	00:37:44	00:37:46	Or after Karen killed her.
485	00:37:46	00:37:48	I'd hate to think Fiore's telling the truth.
486	00:37:54	00:37:59	Okay, so, there were no fibers in Jillian's nose or throat.
487	00:37:59	00:38:03	So Karen had to have used something non-textile to asphyxiate her.
488	00:38:03	00:38:05	Shower curtain was intact.
489	00:38:05	00:38:09	Plastic laundry bags were clean and folded in the closet.
490	00:38:16	00:38:19	Trash can liner.
491	00:38:19	00:38:21	There was nothing in it, so I didn't collect it.
492	00:38:22	00:38:25	You had no reason to.
493	00:38:29	00:38:32	Looks like a lipstick smudge to me.
494	00:38:32	00:38:35	Who kisses a trash bag?
495	00:38:35	00:38:37	Maybe a girl fighting for her life.
496	00:38:57	00:38:58	Those are carpal prints.
497	00:38:59	00:39:02	No way those are Karen's prints.
498	00:39:02	00:39:03	They're too big.
499	00:39:03	00:39:04	Karen didn't kill her.
500	00:39:06	00:39:08	She came back to the room and found Jillian dead.
501	00:39:08	00:39:14	Then Karen hid Jillian inside the box spring to buy herself some time.
502	00:39:14	00:39:16	She then...
503	00:39:16	00:39:19	took the wallet over to the hotel room and tried to extort money from Fiore.
504	00:39:19	00:39:22	Live by the con, die by the con.
505	00:39:28	00:39:30	Mr. Fiore.
506	00:39:30	00:39:33	There's been a development.
507	00:39:33	00:39:34	We need your major case prints.
508	00:39:34	00:39:37	I already gave you my prints.
509	00:39:37	00:39:41	And I admitted to killing Karen Jones in self-defense.
510	00:39:41	00:39:43	That was a standard ten-card.
511	00:39:43	00:39:44	Give me your right hand.
512	00:39:44	00:39:45	And if I refuse?
513	00:39:45	00:39:52	Then I'm going to get six of the biggest deputies you've ever seen to come in here and assist you.
514	00:40:17	00:40:24	Jillian Rose was suffocated with a trash liner from her motel room, and your prints are on it.
515	00:40:24	00:40:25	How did you find out where she was staying?
516	00:40:25	00:40:28	I wanted my wallet back.
517	00:40:28	00:40:33	I went out looking for Jillian, and I saw her at the casino next door.
518	00:40:34	00:40:36	She jumped into a cab, and I followed her.
519	00:40:48	00:40:49	Open up or I'll call the police.
520	00:40:49	00:40:51	Give me my wallet, you bitch!
521	00:40:51	00:40:52	I don't have it!
522	00:40:52	00:40:53	Give me my wallet! I swear!
523	00:40:53	00:40:55	I want my wallet!
524	00:41:06	00:41:13	It was a mathematical certainty that a woman like that would report the assault or she would blackmail me for the rest of my life.
525	00:41:13	00:41:15	The only logical thing to do was to kill her.
526	00:41:15	00:41:19	And you applied that same logic when Karen Jones showed up at your door?
527	00:41:20	00:41:23	You know what that stupid girl did?
528	00:41:23	00:41:29	She-She pointed a gun at me, and she demanded that I give her $50,000 for her friend's funeral.
529	00:41:30	00:41:37	Well, according to my math, the $50,000 that you saved is going to cost you 20 years to life.
530	00:41:41	00:41:42	W-Wait...
531	00:41:42	00:41:43	Look, I-I am a good man.
532	00:41:44	00:41:45	I work hard.
533	00:41:45	00:41:47	I love my wife.
534	00:41:47	00:41:48	I contribute to society.
535	00:41:48	00:41:51	I mean, these people, you deal with them all the time. And those girls?
536	00:41:51	00:41:53	They were just... they were just worthless criminals.
537	00:41:53	00:41:55	No, they were human beings.
538	00:41:55	00:41:58	You're the worthless criminal.
539	00:42:11	00:42:12	Okay, I'll come by your place.
540	00:42:12	00:42:14	No, no, it's cool. I have tomorrow off.
541	00:42:14	00:42:15	Hey, Nick?
542	00:42:15	00:42:17	I'll call you back.
543	00:42:17	00:42:19	Listen, I need to talk to you.
544	00:42:19	00:42:24	Uh, I had Wendy run the markers for race on the appendix implanted in Bernard Higgins.
545	00:42:24	00:42:27	It was non-Hispanic Caucasian.
546	00:42:27	00:42:30	Now, all the body parts we found in the truck were Hispanic.
547	00:42:30	00:42:33	I don't think Hughes is Dr. Jekyll.
548	00:42:33	00:42:35	Regardless, we-we got him for drug trafficking.
549	00:42:35	00:42:39	We got him for practicing without a license and Eduardo Gomez's death.
550	00:42:39	00:42:41	Yeah. Yeah. He's not going anywhere.
551	00:42:41	00:42:43	Agreed.
552	00:42:43	00:42:45	I need a favor.
553	00:42:45	00:42:47	I think your Spanish is a little better than mine.
554	00:42:47	00:42:49	Would you take a look at that for me, please?
555	00:42:51	00:42:53	Clinica gratis.
556	00:42:53	00:42:55	Okay. Free clinic.
557	00:42:55	00:43:00	Pedíatra, emergencias, medicina general.
558	00:43:00	00:43:03	I thought I was the only one trying to save the world.
559	00:43:04	00:43:08	I don't approve of the way Hughes went about it, but he had the right idea.
560	00:43:08	00:43:13	This clinic I volunteer at, it's safe, it's free, it's legal.
561	00:43:13	00:43:16	I just want to spread the word.
562	00:43:17	00:43:18	What do you think? Claro?
563	00:43:18	00:43:20	Sí, claro.
564	00:43:24	00:43:25	Thanks, Nick.
565	00:43:25	00:43:27	De nada.
