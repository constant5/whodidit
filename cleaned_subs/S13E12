2,00:00:14,00:00:19,CHRIS EVERT: What an incredible turn of events in this women's semi-final match.
3,00:00:19,00:00:25,Second seed Tara Janssen is struggling to stay alive in this match against 18th seed Claudia Weber.
4,00:00:25,00:00:27,"LINDSAY DAVENPORT: Well, Weber's not just any opponent."
5,00:00:27,00:00:29,"These two, very close friends off the court."
6,00:00:29,00:00:33,"I know what it's like to play against a friend, and it's not easy."
7,00:00:33,00:00:35,It's a difficult proposition for both these players.
8,00:00:35,00:00:36,Weber to serve.
9,00:00:43,00:00:46,A huge Janssen forehand.
10,00:00:46,00:00:47,Weber's getting to every ball.
11,00:00:47,00:00:52,"(crowd cheers, applauds)"
12,00:00:52,00:00:54,CHAIR UMPIRE: 40-15.
13,00:00:54,00:00:59,DAVENPORT: Incredible rally ends with the easy unforced error from Janssen.
14,00:00:59,00:01:01,"Weber, now with her first match point."
15,00:01:01,00:01:03,"You know, Lindsay, Weber has never beaten Janssen."
16,00:01:03,00:01:04,And this would be an incredible win for her.
17,00:01:04,00:01:07,"Oh, biggest match of her career."
18,00:01:07,00:01:11,"Claudia's husband and coach, Ivan, looks as nervous as she does right now."
19,00:01:11,00:01:13,"And her father, also, who's cheering her on."
20,00:01:13,00:01:16,"You know, he's never missed a match since she's been 12 years old."
21,00:01:21,00:01:22,CHAIR UMPIRE: Let.
22,00:01:22,00:01:23,DAVENPORT: Uh-oh.
23,00:01:23,00:01:25,A little tight there on that first serve.
24,00:01:25,00:01:26,"Nerves, maybe?"
25,00:01:47,00:01:49,"CHAIR UMPIRE: Game, match, Weber."
26,00:01:49,00:01:51,"(crowd cheers, applauds)"
27,00:01:51,00:01:53,DAVENPORT: What a way to end it.
28,00:01:53,00:01:55,120-mile-per-hour ace to seal it.
29,00:01:55,00:02:01,"EVERT: Wow, and Claudia Weber now advances to her first-ever premiere final."
30,00:02:05,00:02:09,"Claudia, congratulations on an incredible win in front of your hometown crowd."
31,00:02:09,00:02:14,Is it even more challenging playing against one of your best friends and doubles partners?
32,00:02:14,00:02:17,She's an incredible competitor.
33,00:02:17,00:02:20,That's what makes her a great doubles partner.
34,00:02:20,00:02:25,"Oh, and I want to thank my husband and my Dad for believing in me."
35,00:02:25,00:02:28,"And to all of you, who cheered me on."
36,00:02:28,00:02:29,Thank you.
37,00:02:30,00:02:33,Thank you.
38,00:02:40,00:02:42,"Mm, gosh, what a shame."
39,00:02:44,00:02:47,Did you ever see Claudia Weber play?
40,00:02:47,00:02:49,"No, I never did."
41,00:02:49,00:02:51,"More of a basketball fan, really."
42,00:02:51,00:02:52,"Mm, she was such a great player."
43,00:02:52,00:02:54,And a really good person off the court.
44,00:02:54,00:02:56,You sound like a real fan.
45,00:02:56,00:03:00,"AKERS: CSIs Russell and Finlay, meet Justin Gimelstob."
46,00:03:00,00:03:02,He's the one who found the body this morning.
47,00:03:02,00:03:05,"Want to tell us how you found her, please?"
48,00:03:05,00:03:10,"Just going through my normal routine, trying to get a light workout in, hit some balls against the ball machine."
49,00:03:14,00:03:15,And I called the police.
50,00:03:15,00:03:18,We're going to need your clothes for evidence.
51,00:03:18,00:03:20,I'll escort you to the locker room.
52,00:03:20,00:03:21,RUSSELL: Thank you.
53,00:03:28,00:03:30,FINLAY: Clay's been disturbed.
54,00:03:33,00:03:35,Medium force spatter.
55,00:03:41,00:03:43,Claudia was definitely killed here.
56,00:03:43,00:03:47,Who says tennis isn't a blood sport?
57,00:04:23,00:04:25,Here goes the last of the rigor.
58,00:04:25,00:04:26,Ready? Mm-hmm.
59,00:04:28,00:04:30,"(groans, sighs)"
60,00:04:30,00:04:34,"Wow, her right arm is quite a bit bigger than her left."
61,00:04:34,00:04:35,"Well, that's typical of tennis players."
62,00:04:35,00:04:37,Their hitting arm's often more muscular.
63,00:04:37,00:04:39,You a tennis fan?
64,00:04:39,00:04:43,"Yeah, my, uh, doubles partner and I are the top-ranked wheelchair team at our club."
65,00:04:43,00:04:46,Liver temp. is 89.5.
66,00:04:46,00:04:48,Puts TOD at less than six hours.
67,00:04:49,00:04:51,Shouldn't it be 12 hours?
68,00:04:51,00:04:52,She's in full rigor.
69,00:04:52,00:04:58,Physical activity so close to death sometimes causes the body to go into rigor a little faster than normal.
70,00:04:58,00:05:00,Got a spatter pattern on her shoe.
71,00:05:00,00:05:04,"Clay mixed in, so I can't really tell if it's blood."
72,00:05:04,00:05:06,Serious blunt-force trauma to the head.
73,00:05:06,00:05:09,"She may have won the match, but she took a beating on the court."
74,00:05:10,00:05:15,"Ms. Weber was not only beaten, she was stabbed in the throat, too."
75,00:05:15,00:05:19,Wasn't there another tennis player who got stabbed on the court years ago?
76,00:05:19,00:05:21,"Yeah, Monica Seles."
77,00:05:21,00:05:24,By an obsessed Steffi Graff fan. Right.
78,00:05:24,00:05:26,Sports fans can be extremely passionate.
79,00:05:26,00:05:30,Maybe someone was not happy that Claudia won that match yesterday.
80,00:05:34,00:05:37,Why are you treating me like a suspect?
81,00:05:37,00:05:39,My wife just died.
82,00:05:39,00:05:41,I understand that.
83,00:05:41,00:05:44,"But if anything, we're doing everything we can to eliminate you as a suspect."
84,00:05:46,00:05:48,When's the last time you saw Claudia?
85,00:05:48,00:05:50,"Uh, right after her match."
86,00:05:50,00:05:54,"I stayed for her press conference, then I went home."
87,00:05:54,00:05:56,"You know, her car was still in the parking lot."
88,00:05:56,00:06:00,Were you worried when she didn't come home last night?
89,00:06:00,00:06:01,She booked a room in a hotel across the street.
90,00:06:04,00:06:08,"My snoring, uh, keeps her up at night."
91,00:06:08,00:06:11,And she wanted to get a good night's rest before the final.
92,00:06:11,00:06:13,She was on that court really late last night.
93,00:06:13,00:06:15,Does she normally stay after hours like that?
94,00:06:15,00:06:18,She liked to hit balls after a big match at night.
95,00:06:18,00:06:20,It would clear her head.
96,00:06:20,00:06:24,So anybody in the tennis world would understand that's... that's part of her routine?
97,00:06:24,00:06:26,"Athletes, they're-- they're creatures of habit."
98,00:06:26,00:06:29,Do you know of anyone who would want to hurt your wife?
99,00:06:29,00:06:32,Everyone loved Claudia.
100,00:06:34,00:06:35,"Okay, man."
101,00:06:38,00:06:41,The hardest part is telling her dad.
102,00:06:41,00:06:44,He just lost his wife last year.
103,00:06:44,00:06:47,Claudia's... she was all he had left.
104,00:06:47,00:06:50,"I'm going to do everything I can to find out who did this, all right?"
105,00:06:54,00:06:55,Check out these scuff marks.
106,00:06:56,00:06:59,Ms. Weber struggled with her killer.
107,00:07:00,00:07:02,(grunting)
108,00:07:05,00:07:06,FINLAY: Got more blood drops.
109,00:07:11,00:07:14,"Some grass, little pieces of gravel."
110,00:07:14,00:07:16,Could've come from the killer's shoes.
111,00:07:16,00:07:20,"All right, I'll collect this section of the clay, and then I'll bring it back to the lab."
112,00:07:33,00:07:36,"SANDERS: I got more blood drops, leading to the garbage can."
113,00:07:36,00:07:38,Killer could've tried to dispose of the weapon.
114,00:07:40,00:07:42,It's empty; the bag's been changed.
115,00:07:42,00:07:46,"Well, looks like I'm going Dumpster diving."
116,00:07:54,00:07:57,"AGENT: Excuse me, are you CSI Supervisor Diebekorn Russell?"
117,00:07:57,00:08:00,"Judging by the suit, I'm guessing you're a government agent."
118,00:08:00,00:08:04,"And, if you're DEA, the mushrooms behind me are medicinal."
119,00:08:04,00:08:06,I've been through this before with you guys.
120,00:08:06,00:08:08,"I'm not here about your mushrooms, sir."
121,00:08:08,00:08:10,"Agent Smith, USCIS."
122,00:08:10,00:08:12,Immigration.
123,00:08:12,00:08:14,All right. What's that about?
124,00:08:14,00:08:16,"One of your employees, David Hodges."
125,00:08:16,00:08:18,David? He's an American citizen.
126,00:08:18,00:08:22,"He's got family in Canada, yeah, but, I mean, who doesn't?"
127,00:08:22,00:08:23,How would you describe Mr. Hodges' character?
128,00:08:23,00:08:26,"A little odd, but nice, hardworking."
129,00:08:26,00:08:29,"To the best of your knowledge, has he ever been dishonest?"
130,00:08:29,00:08:31,No. Never falsified reports?
131,00:08:31,00:08:34,"Tampered with evidence? No, no, absolutely not."
132,00:08:34,00:08:36,Does he travel internationally a lot?
133,00:08:36,00:08:38,"Not that you'd notice, no."
134,00:08:38,00:08:43,"Well, wait, no, he took his mom to Italy last year."
135,00:08:43,00:08:45,Is Hodges in some kind of trouble?
136,00:08:48,00:08:49,You recognize that woman?
137,00:08:49,00:08:51,"No, should I?"
138,00:08:51,00:08:53,David Hodges claims she's his fianc√©e.
139,00:08:53,00:08:56,HODGES: Her name is Elisabetta.
140,00:08:56,00:08:59,We met at her family's vineyard in Tuscany.
141,00:08:59,00:09:03,She educated me about the acidic properties of the Sangiovese grape.
142,00:09:03,00:09:05,Sounds romantic. It was amore.
143,00:09:05,00:09:09,I knew then that we were destined to spend our lives together.
144,00:09:09,00:09:11,"Well, I-I certainly hope that Immigration agrees with you."
145,00:09:14,00:09:18,Did the agent happen to seem overly suspicious?
146,00:09:18,00:09:22,"Raised a red flag, yeah, when I-I didn't recognize Eli-Eli..."
147,00:09:22,00:09:23,Elisabetta.
148,00:09:23,00:09:26,Why-why didn't you tell anyone?
149,00:09:26,00:09:27,"Um, what can I say?"
150,00:09:27,00:09:30,I'm a man of mystery.
151,00:09:30,00:09:32,"Yeah, okay."
152,00:09:32,00:09:34,"Um, hey, very happy for you."
153,00:09:34,00:09:36,"Congratulations. Well, thank you."
154,00:09:36,00:09:39,I'm going to let you get back to your clay.
155,00:09:39,00:09:41,"You know, technically, it's not clay."
156,00:09:41,00:09:43,American courts use crushed basalt.
157,00:09:43,00:09:45,"Ah, see, I didn't know that. That's fascinating."
158,00:09:45,00:09:48,"Okay, good, um..."
159,00:09:48,00:09:53,"ROBBINS: As you can see, being a professional athlete takes its toll on the body."
160,00:09:53,00:09:57,"Broken wrist, stress fractures in the feet."
161,00:09:57,00:09:59,Come look at this.
162,00:10:01,00:10:11,"Brown discoloration of the cerebral cortex adjacent to brown discoloration of the subdura-- indicative of previous head trauma, likely a contusion."
163,00:10:11,00:10:13,How long ago?
164,00:10:13,00:10:14,No way to know for sure.
165,00:10:14,00:10:16,What about her current injuries?
166,00:10:18,00:10:25,Three depressed skull fractures that left rectangular impressions approximately one inch wide.
167,00:10:25,00:10:27,Is that the cause of death?
168,00:10:27,00:10:35,"No, actually this was: this vertical fracture bisected the thyroid prominence and fractured both superior horns, causing a soft tissue hemorrhage."
169,00:10:43,00:10:45,She choked on her own blood.
170,00:10:45,00:10:47,"Essentially, yes."
171,00:10:47,00:10:49,Any idea what the murder weapon is yet?
172,00:10:49,00:10:53,"Well, the margins of the wound are jagged and the puncture's less than an inch deep."
173,00:10:53,00:10:57,"Doesn't appear to be a knife, but at this point, I can't say for certain what it was."
174,00:11:00,00:11:04,"So, Ernest, what time did you change the trash bags on that court?"
175,00:11:04,00:11:07,"Uh, start of my shift, around 6:00 a.m."
176,00:11:07,00:11:10,"You, uh, see anything unusual in there?"
177,00:11:10,00:11:15,"I don't look in the bags, not since a player on the court had food poisoning."
178,00:11:15,00:11:17,Bags were full of puke.
179,00:11:17,00:11:18,"Oh, well, that's great."
180,00:11:18,00:11:20,"You don't mind going first, do you, Greg?"
181,00:11:22,00:11:25,"So, this is, uh, everything from yesterday and this morning."
182,00:11:25,00:11:27,Okay.
183,00:11:27,00:11:28,"Thank you, Ernest."
184,00:11:36,00:11:37,(groans)
185,00:11:58,00:12:00,Here we go.
186,00:12:04,00:12:06,Broken tennis racket.
187,00:12:06,00:12:09,This could be our murder weapon right here.
188,00:12:09,00:12:12,Looks like there's some blood on it.
189,00:12:12,00:12:14,"Well, Claudia had blunt-force trauma to the head."
190,00:12:14,00:12:18,Killer must have hit her with that racket and broke the frame.
191,00:12:18,00:12:20,(grunting)
192,00:12:20,00:12:25,"STOKES: Yeah, and then used this sharp edge to stab her in the throat."
193,00:12:25,00:12:29,"You know, I know tape on the handle absorbs sweat."
194,00:12:29,00:12:30,"SANDERS: Well, that means DNA."
195,00:12:47,00:12:49,(machine whirs)
196,00:12:57,00:13:00,Got some results for you.
197,00:13:00,00:13:01,"Hey, Henry..."
198,00:13:01,00:13:03,"you're friends with Hodges, right?"
199,00:13:03,00:13:04,"Uh, depends on the day."
200,00:13:04,00:13:06,Did you know that he was engaged?
201,00:13:06,00:13:11,"You know, I heard it from Rick, in QD, who heard it from Arlene in Reception."
202,00:13:11,00:13:12,Word travels fast around here.
203,00:13:12,00:13:14,"Yeah, well..."
204,00:13:14,00:13:17,ever since Hodges accused me of trying to steal Wendy...
205,00:13:17,00:13:18,"Wait, who's Wendy?"
206,00:13:18,00:13:21,Our old DNA analyst.
207,00:13:23,00:13:27,"Sorry. Uh, anyway, since then, he doesn't really confide in me anymore."
208,00:13:27,00:13:30,"Okay, you have some results for me."
209,00:13:30,00:13:31,I do.
210,00:13:31,00:13:35,Blood on the frame of the tennis racket was a match to our victim Claudia Weber.
211,00:13:35,00:13:37,"So, it's definitely the murder weapon."
212,00:13:37,00:13:40,She was also the major contributor of DNA on the handle.
213,00:13:40,00:13:43,Killed by her own racket.
214,00:13:43,00:13:46,"But there was a minor contributor of touch DNA on the handle, as well."
215,00:13:46,00:13:52,"And get this: It came back to Tara Janssen, the player that Weber just beat in the semifinals."
216,00:13:52,00:13:55,"I guess Tara was a sore loser, after all."
217,00:14:03,00:14:04,"Ms. Janssen, would you mind?"
218,00:14:04,00:14:06,"Oh, not at all. Of course."
219,00:14:08,00:14:10,"Hey, break it up."
220,00:14:10,00:14:15,"Ms. Janssen, I hate to drag you away from your adoring fans, but we have to talk."
221,00:14:15,00:14:17,"Please, come with me."
222,00:14:17,00:14:20,Claudia was like a little sister to me.
223,00:14:20,00:14:23,I've known her since she was 14.
224,00:14:23,00:14:25,How could you possibly think that I'd do anything to hurt her?
225,00:14:25,00:14:31,"Because your DNA was on her tennis racket, which just so happens to be the murder weapon."
226,00:14:31,00:14:32,Let me show you.
227,00:14:34,00:14:36,Claudia and I both used the Ace-Trak 528 racket.
228,00:14:36,00:14:42,"A couple of times, when we were playing doubles, we grabbed each other's by mistake."
229,00:14:42,00:14:44,Okay.
230,00:14:44,00:14:47,"Ms. Janssen, let me ask you something."
231,00:14:47,00:14:49,What's the prize money on these kind of tournaments?
232,00:14:49,00:14:50,Half a million.
233,00:14:50,00:14:52,That's a good chunk of change.
234,00:14:52,00:14:56,"So when Claudia knocked you out of the tournament, you obviously lost your shot at the cash."
235,00:14:56,00:14:57,I'm not interested in the prize money.
236,00:14:57,00:15:00,I made $11 million in endorsement deals last year.
237,00:15:00,00:15:03,So you do it for the glory; for the love of the game.
238,00:15:03,00:15:05,I'm chasing history.
239,00:15:05,00:15:08,"17 more wins, and I'll break the record for most career singles titles."
240,00:15:08,00:15:11,"But, you know, let's face it, I mean, you're pushing 30."
241,00:15:11,00:15:14,"I mean, that's not old, but in tennis, that's old."
242,00:15:14,00:15:19,"And young up-and-comers like Claudia could get in the way of you chasing your legacy, right?"
243,00:15:19,00:15:23,"Listen, no one likes to lose, but... she deserved to win."
244,00:15:23,00:15:24,She played a great match.
245,00:15:24,00:15:26,And I was happy for her.
246,00:15:26,00:15:28,You weren't always such a gracious loser.
247,00:15:28,00:15:30,Let me show you something.
248,00:15:30,00:15:33,This was taken about a month ago.
249,00:15:33,00:15:35,TARA: That ball was out?
250,00:15:35,00:15:37,"That ball that landed right there, that was out?"
251,00:15:39,00:15:40,(muttering)
252,00:15:45,00:15:47,Wow.
253,00:15:47,00:15:49,Yeah.
254,00:15:49,00:15:52,Where were you between 11:00 and 1:00 last night?
255,00:15:52,00:15:56,"I had a late dinner with Chris Evert, and then I went home and I went to bed."
256,00:16:06,00:16:08,Ms. Evert? I'm CSI Finlay.
257,00:16:08,00:16:11,I need to ask you some questions about Tara Janssen.
258,00:16:11,00:16:12,"Sure, but can it wait?"
259,00:16:12,00:16:14,I'm right in the middle of a workout.
260,00:16:17,00:16:19,Can I borrow your racket for a moment?
261,00:16:19,00:16:21,Thank you.
262,00:16:21,00:16:22,You play?
263,00:16:22,00:16:24,A little. When I was a kid.
264,00:16:24,00:16:26,"But enough to keep the ball going, so we can talk."
265,00:16:26,00:16:28,Let's see what you got.
266,00:16:28,00:16:30,So what was your relationship with Tara?
267,00:16:30,00:16:36,"Well, she's been getting some code violations lately, and I'm really trying to help her with her anger issues."
268,00:16:36,00:16:38,When was the last time you saw her?
269,00:16:38,00:16:42,"Last night, after her match."
270,00:16:42,00:16:44,We were just chatting about her game.
271,00:16:44,00:16:46,"Grabbed a bite, and then I just dropped her off at her condo."
272,00:16:46,00:16:49,What time was that? A little before midnight.
273,00:16:49,00:16:53,Did Claudia Weber have any issues with anybody on the tour?
274,00:16:53,00:16:56,"No, not the players."
275,00:16:56,00:16:59,But she hasn't been too happy about her coach lately.
276,00:16:59,00:17:02,Is that her husband Ivan?
277,00:17:02,00:17:05,Yeah. She actually has been thinking about firing him.
278,00:17:05,00:17:06,Really?
279,00:17:06,00:17:09,She asked me if I'd be interested in coaching her.
280,00:17:11,00:17:13,Whoa! (laughs)
281,00:17:13,00:17:14,Where'd that come from?
282,00:17:14,00:17:15,You holding out on me?
283,00:17:15,00:17:17,I learned it from watching you.
284,00:17:17,00:17:18,(both laugh)
285,00:17:18,00:17:19,Thank you.
286,00:17:21,00:17:23,(speaking Italian)
287,00:17:23,00:17:24,Uh...
288,00:17:24,00:17:27,(continues speaking Italian)
289,00:17:27,00:17:28,"What is the problem, baby?"
290,00:17:28,00:17:30,Are you ashamed with me?
291,00:17:30,00:17:32,"Elisabetta, mio amore, please calm down."
292,00:17:32,00:17:33,Calmati.
293,00:17:33,00:17:35,Calmati. No.
294,00:17:35,00:17:37,Potresti avere all spoiled.
295,00:17:37,00:17:39,(continues speaking Italian)
296,00:17:39,00:17:41,Do you understand me?
297,00:17:41,00:17:43,Si. Si. Si.
298,00:17:43,00:17:44,Who is that?
299,00:17:44,00:17:46,Hodges' fianc√©e.
300,00:17:46,00:17:47,Fianc√©e?!
301,00:17:47,00:17:48,Yeah. Shh.
302,00:17:48,00:17:50,I'm trying to figure out what she's saying.
303,00:17:50,00:17:52,"If my translate app is correct, it's something about a green card."
304,00:17:52,00:17:53,HODGES: Don't worry.
305,00:17:53,00:17:55,Everything will be okay.
306,00:17:55,00:17:56,(scoffs) Okay?
307,00:17:56,00:17:57,Si. Bene.
308,00:17:57,00:17:58,Non okay.
309,00:17:58,00:17:59,(speaking Italian)
310,00:18:01,00:18:03,"Like I'm invisible, or what?"
311,00:18:03,00:18:05,Mm-mm. Ti amo.
312,00:18:05,00:18:08,"No, it's--I didn't want to tell anybody about you yet."
313,00:18:08,00:18:09,Non soon pronto.
314,00:18:09,00:18:11,(speaking Italian)
315,00:18:11,00:18:12,Cold toes?
316,00:18:12,00:18:14,"Oh, she means cold feet."
317,00:18:14,00:18:15,"Hey, shh."
318,00:18:17,00:18:19,No. No cold feet.
319,00:18:19,00:18:21,(speaking Italian)
320,00:18:23,00:18:24,There is another woman in your life?
321,00:18:24,00:18:27,Qualche bionda bimbo Americana?
322,00:18:27,00:18:28,"No, wait..."
323,00:18:28,00:18:29,"Oh, she thinks there's another woman."
324,00:18:29,00:18:31,"Yeah, I got that."
325,00:18:31,00:18:35,Elisabetta... there is only you.
326,00:18:35,00:18:36,Sei l'unica donna...
327,00:18:38,00:18:40,...che amo.
328,00:18:44,00:18:46,(speaks Italian)
329,00:18:46,00:18:48,"You drive me crazy, David, you know that?"
330,00:18:49,00:18:51,I love you.
331,00:18:55,00:18:59,I have never been jealous of Hodges until this moment.
332,00:18:59,00:19:00,"Mm-hmm, yeah."
333,00:19:02,00:19:03,Wha...? (camera clicks)
334,00:19:06,00:19:09,Now everybody knows who I am.
335,00:19:11,00:19:13,"(man) Way to go, Hodges!"
336,00:19:13,00:19:15,"You have something for me, right?"
337,00:19:15,00:19:16,Yes...
338,00:19:16,00:19:21,"Uh, Hodges found traces of chewing tobacco in the clay."
339,00:19:21,00:19:24,It's the same trace that Finn pulled off the victim's shoes.
340,00:19:24,00:19:26,Guess who the DNA comes back to.
341,00:19:26,00:19:30,"Why'd you lie to me, Ivan?"
342,00:19:30,00:19:31,What do you mean?
343,00:19:31,00:19:35,You know as well as I do you were on that practice court with Claudia last night.
344,00:19:35,00:19:36,BRODY: Chewing tobacco is a dirty habit.
345,00:19:36,00:19:41,"When you spit, you got some on your wife's shoes."
346,00:19:41,00:19:43,We have DNA to prove it's yours.
347,00:19:43,00:19:46,We know Claudia was shopping around for a new coach.
348,00:19:46,00:19:49,You were about to be fired by your wife.
349,00:19:49,00:19:52,"That's got to be a serious blow to the ego, man."
350,00:19:52,00:19:55,"You couldn't handle it, so you killed her."
351,00:19:55,00:19:57,No! No.
352,00:19:59,00:20:01,I went there to talk to her.
353,00:20:02,00:20:06,"You just had the best game of your career, and you want to fire me?"
354,00:20:06,00:20:09,I can't take orders from you on the court and then come home to you at night.
355,00:20:09,00:20:10,"It's too hard. So, that's it?"
356,00:20:10,00:20:12,"You're just gonna get rid of me, huh? I'm gone."
357,00:20:12,00:20:19,"If we want to try and make this marriage work, you can't be my husband and my coach."
358,00:20:19,00:20:23,I agreed to do whatever it took to save our marriage.
359,00:20:23,00:20:24,And how long had you two been having trouble?
360,00:20:24,00:20:28,About a year.
361,00:20:28,00:20:32,The last month had been the worst. Uh...
362,00:20:32,00:20:34,She hadn't been herself.
363,00:20:34,00:20:35,What do you mean?
364,00:20:35,00:20:36,She'd been having nightmares.
365,00:20:36,00:20:39,She was calling out some guy's name.
366,00:20:39,00:20:40,Brent.
367,00:20:40,00:20:41,Is that somebody on tour?
368,00:20:41,00:20:43,Not that I know of.
369,00:20:43,00:20:45,"When I asked her about it, she wouldn't tell me."
370,00:20:47,00:20:49,She'd been kind of secretive lately.
371,00:20:49,00:20:52,Is it possible that your wife was having an affair?
372,00:20:52,00:20:55,I don't think so.
373,00:20:55,00:20:59,"Claudia was the most honest, decent person that I ever met."
374,00:21:05,00:21:09,Hey. This is the last of what was collected from Claudia Weber's locker.
375,00:21:12,00:21:15,Cat treats...
376,00:21:15,00:21:17,three different kinds of hand lotion.
377,00:21:17,00:21:20,Learn a lot about a woman from what she keeps in her purse.
378,00:21:20,00:21:22,Same goes for her tennis bag.
379,00:21:22,00:21:23,"Oh, what's this thing called?"
380,00:21:23,00:21:25,A Blossom Ballerina?
381,00:21:25,00:21:27,"Oh, yeah. My daughter had one of those."
382,00:21:27,00:21:28,Took it everywhere.
383,00:21:28,00:21:30,Athletes tend to be superstitious.
384,00:21:30,00:21:32,Maybe it was a good luck charm.
385,00:21:32,00:21:34,Receipts from Tasty Time and Choozies Chicken.
386,00:21:34,00:21:39,"Well, players burn a lot of calories, and fast food is an easy way to replace them."
387,00:21:39,00:21:41,Their dirty little secret.
388,00:21:41,00:21:43,"She might have another secret, too."
389,00:21:43,00:21:45,This looks like LSD.
390,00:21:45,00:21:47,(laughs)
391,00:21:47,00:21:49,"Man, that takes me back."
392,00:21:49,00:21:51,"Wait, you took LSD?"
393,00:21:51,00:21:53,No.
394,00:21:53,00:21:54,"No, my folks did."
395,00:21:56,00:21:59,"Hey, wasn't illegal until 1966."
396,00:21:59,00:22:01,Okay.
397,00:22:01,00:22:03,But Claudia Weber's tox was clean.
398,00:22:03,00:22:05,"And as you know, or your folks, should know..."
399,00:22:05,00:22:09,(chuckles) LSD doesn't stay in your system for more than a half an hour.
400,00:22:09,00:22:12,"You know, her husband thought that she was keeping a secret from him."
401,00:22:12,00:22:14,This would be quite a doozy.
402,00:22:14,00:22:17,But LSD isn't a performance enhancer.
403,00:22:17,00:22:19,It's recreational.
404,00:22:19,00:22:23,"So, pressures of the game, maybe it was Claudia's way of coping."
405,00:22:23,00:22:27,He also said that she was having nightmares about a guy named Brent.
406,00:22:27,00:22:29,Didn't think he was part of the tennis world.
407,00:22:29,00:22:31,Maybe he's part of this world.
408,00:22:31,00:22:32,We got a print here.
409,00:22:36,00:22:38,"(computer blipping, trilling)"
410,00:22:45,00:22:51,"RUSSELL: ""Darcy Shaw."" ""Felony drug distribution."" SHAW: I'm not a drug dealer."
411,00:22:51,00:22:54,I'm a doctor.
412,00:22:54,00:22:59,"Well, Ms. Shaw, says here you, uh, took an online course in hypnotherapy."
413,00:22:59,00:23:02,That doesn't really qualify you as a physician.
414,00:23:02,00:23:05,Or give you the right to dispense illegal drugs.
415,00:23:05,00:23:12,Mind-altering drugs like LSD have been used for thousands of years to help open the mind and connect the body with the soul.
416,00:23:12,00:23:18,"Along with hypnotherapy, this can be a valuable tool in healing both mental and physical ailments."
417,00:23:18,00:23:22,And what ailment were you treating Claudia Weber for?
418,00:23:22,00:23:30,"Claudia had been having violent dreams, and I believe that they were repressed memories of a traumatic experience that happened when she was four."
419,00:23:30,00:23:32,What kind of a traumatic experience?
420,00:23:32,00:23:36,I think that someone viciously attacked Claudia and her mother.
421,00:23:36,00:23:38,She actually remembered this happening?
422,00:23:38,00:23:43,"Well, recovered memories-- it's not like a movie with a beginning, middle and an end."
423,00:23:43,00:23:45,It-It comes in flashes.
424,00:23:45,00:23:48,And the brain doesn't want to remember. It's...
425,00:23:48,00:23:49,It's too painful.
426,00:23:49,00:23:51,Mm. So how's that work?
427,00:23:51,00:23:53,"What, do you interpret those flashes, do you?"
428,00:23:53,00:23:57,"I wasn't influencing Claudia's memories, if that's what you're implying."
429,00:23:57,00:24:01,I was just there to guide her safely through the process.
430,00:24:01,00:24:03,I recorded the sessions if you'd like to see them.
431,00:24:03,00:24:10,"SHAW: As I continue to talk, you feel a heavy, relaxed feeling come over you."
432,00:24:10,00:24:16,"With every word that I say, it's putting you faster and deeper into a peaceful state of hypnosis."
433,00:24:16,00:24:18,"How old are you, Claudia?"
434,00:24:18,00:24:20,Four.
435,00:24:20,00:24:21,Look at that.
436,00:24:21,00:24:23,She's already under the influence.
437,00:24:23,00:24:26,The LSD is making her prone to suggestion.
438,00:24:26,00:24:30,Maybe it's just making it easier for her to tap into her subconscious.
439,00:24:30,00:24:32,SHAW: Where are you?
440,00:24:32,00:24:33,(Claudia panting)
441,00:24:33,00:24:34,I'm in the woods.
442,00:24:34,00:24:36,Who is with you?
443,00:24:36,00:24:37,CLAUDIA: I'm in a tent.
444,00:24:37,00:24:40,By myself.
445,00:24:40,00:24:43,I'm scared. No one can hurt you.
446,00:24:43,00:24:44,You're safe.
447,00:24:44,00:24:46,"(clanking, banging, woman screaming)"
448,00:24:46,00:24:48,Mommy?!
449,00:24:48,00:24:49,They're hurting her.
450,00:24:49,00:24:50,SHAW: Who's hurting her?
451,00:24:50,00:24:52,I don't know.
452,00:24:52,00:24:53,(man grunts)
453,00:24:56,00:24:57,(Claudia gasps)
454,00:24:59,00:25:00,(gasps)
455,00:25:01,00:25:04,I need you to stay in the tent.
456,00:25:04,00:25:05,"All right, everything's going to be okay."
457,00:25:05,00:25:07,I won't let anything happen.
458,00:25:07,00:25:08,Stay here.
459,00:25:08,00:25:09,(zipping door)
460,00:25:09,00:25:11,Brent! SHAW: Who's Brent?
461,00:25:13,00:25:14,(grunting)
462,00:25:16,00:25:17,Brent?
463,00:25:17,00:25:19,"Okay, so that was her last session."
464,00:25:19,00:25:21,What are you thinking?
465,00:25:21,00:25:25,"She talks about this guy Brent, from her past, who tried to save her."
466,00:25:25,00:25:26,If any of this even happened.
467,00:25:26,00:25:28,Why would you say that?
468,00:25:28,00:25:30,Because it's a memory from when she was four years old.
469,00:25:30,00:25:33,"Tr-trust me, kids' memories are not the most reliable."
470,00:25:33,00:25:35,They have vivid imaginations.
471,00:25:35,00:25:40,Charlie--he swears that he fell off a horse when he was five years old.
472,00:25:40,00:25:41,Never happened.
473,00:25:41,00:25:44,But look at Claudia's autopsy report.
474,00:25:44,00:25:50,Doc found evidence of an old brain injury right where she said she got hit by the shovel.
475,00:25:50,00:25:58,"I mean, don't you think it's strange that Claudia starts having childhood memories of someone trying to kill her, and then, one month later, she's dead?"
476,00:25:58,00:26:01,"I mean, that cannot be a coincidence."
477,00:26:01,00:26:02,Timing is interesting.
478,00:26:02,00:26:07,I'm thinking that whoever tried to kill her when she was a kid came back to finish the job.
479,00:26:13,00:26:15,"Mr. Weber, I am so sorry for your loss."
480,00:26:15,00:26:16,Your daughter was such a talented athlete.
481,00:26:16,00:26:18,Thank you.
482,00:26:18,00:26:21,You-you said you had some questions you wanted to ask me.
483,00:26:21,00:26:25,I do. Did you and your family ever go on a camping trip when Claudia was little?
484,00:26:25,00:26:27,No.
485,00:26:27,00:26:31,"My wife wasn't really the, uh... the roughing-it type."
486,00:26:31,00:26:33,Why?
487,00:26:33,00:26:36,"Well, about month ago, Claudia started having memories from when she was four."
488,00:26:36,00:26:41,A-a camping trip where both she and her mother were violently attacked.
489,00:26:41,00:26:44,We always wondered what happened.
490,00:26:44,00:26:46,What do you mean?
491,00:26:46,00:26:48,I'm not Claudia's biological father.
492,00:26:48,00:26:54,"When she was four years old, I found her lying unconscious by the side of the road, up in Mount Charleston."
493,00:26:54,00:26:56,"She was bleeding, she was near death."
494,00:26:56,00:26:58,I picked her up and I took her to the hospital.
495,00:26:58,00:27:00,Did you report it to the police?
496,00:27:00,00:27:02,"Well, of course. I told them."
497,00:27:02,00:27:05,"They searched the area where I found her, but they..."
498,00:27:05,00:27:06,they never found her family.
499,00:27:06,00:27:09,Did Claudia ever tell anyone what happened to her?
500,00:27:09,00:27:11,She didn't remember anything.
501,00:27:11,00:27:16,"The only way we figured her name was Claudia is because it was, uh..."
502,00:27:16,00:27:17,it was written on her jacket.
503,00:27:17,00:27:19,Did anyone ever come looking for her?
504,00:27:19,00:27:22,Were there any missing persons reports?
505,00:27:22,00:27:25,"Nothing. I mean, we just assumed she was abandoned."
506,00:27:25,00:27:30,"Social Services let my wife and I become foster parents, and then, um..."
507,00:27:30,00:27:34,"well, eventually, we adopted her."
508,00:27:34,00:27:36,Did you tell Claudia any of this?
509,00:27:36,00:27:40,We just wanted her to feel like she was ours.
510,00:27:40,00:27:42,And she was. She was ours.
511,00:27:42,00:27:47,We thought it was a blessing she didn't remember what happened to her.
512,00:27:49,00:27:53,"FINLAY: So, these were taken at the hospital the day Claudia was found."
513,00:27:53,00:27:57,"She suffered severe head trauma, dehydration and multiple cuts and abrasions."
514,00:27:57,00:28:00,"You know, a head injury would explain why she couldn't remember anything."
515,00:28:00,00:28:07,"Yeah, not to mention the emotional trauma from the attack. You know, in all her sessions, Claudia never mentioned a daddy, just Brent."
516,00:28:07,00:28:10,"Could be a brother, stepfather, mother's boyfriend."
517,00:28:10,00:28:13,"Hey, look at that-- Blossom Ballerina."
518,00:28:13,00:28:17,Just like the one you found in Claudia's tennis bag.
519,00:28:17,00:28:19,It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years.
520,00:28:19,00:28:23,"If she had that toy when she was attacked, there still could be evidence on it."
521,00:28:23,00:28:24,I'll get it to Hodges.
522,00:28:27,00:28:29,Hmm.
523,00:28:29,00:28:32,You decapitated Blossom Ballerina.
524,00:28:32,00:28:34,"Well, I assure you, she didn't feel a thing."
525,00:28:34,00:28:37,"So, I talked to Simon Weber."
526,00:28:37,00:28:39,His wife passed away a year ago.
527,00:28:39,00:28:42,"He was cleaning out his house, going through boxes."
528,00:28:42,00:28:45,He came across a box of Claudia's old toys.
529,00:28:45,00:28:47,Hmm. Sent them to her last month.
530,00:28:47,00:28:49,Could be seeing this toy is what triggered her memories.
531,00:28:49,00:28:53,"And if we can figure out who tried to kill her back then, we might be able to find out who killed her now."
532,00:28:53,00:28:55,Exactly.
533,00:28:55,00:28:57,Hm.
534,00:29:03,00:29:05,Was there something else?
535,00:29:05,00:29:07,Yeah.
536,00:29:07,00:29:10,Elisabetta.
537,00:29:10,00:29:13,That's... Wow.
538,00:29:13,00:29:15,"She's something, isn't she?"
539,00:29:15,00:29:17,"Oh, yeah. Firecracker."
540,00:29:17,00:29:18,She is Italian.
541,00:29:18,00:29:22,I'm just surprised you got engaged so quickly.
542,00:29:22,00:29:25,"Well, when you know, you know, right?"
543,00:29:25,00:29:27,But...
544,00:29:27,00:29:33,"you guys haven't known each other that long, and... marriage is not something you rush into."
545,00:29:33,00:29:36,I-I would just hate to see you get hurt.
546,00:29:36,00:29:39,"Yeah. Uh, don't worry about me."
547,00:29:43,00:29:47,What if this woman is using you to get a green card?
548,00:29:47,00:29:49,Yeah.
549,00:29:49,00:29:53,"Why would a beautiful, amazing woman want to marry me, right?"
550,00:29:53,00:29:55,That is not what I meant at all.
551,00:29:55,00:29:57,You know I think you are a great guy; you know that.
552,00:29:57,00:30:02,It took me ten months to choose a new cell phone last year.
553,00:30:02,00:30:07,"I analyzed consumer reports, data rates, battery longevity."
554,00:30:07,00:30:12,"For once, I'm following my heart, not analyzing everything."
555,00:30:12,00:30:17,"And that's great, but you don't have to go from one extreme to the other."
556,00:30:17,00:30:19,Can't you just be happy for me?
557,00:30:22,00:30:24,I don't trust this woman.
558,00:30:24,00:30:26,There's no other way to say it.
559,00:30:26,00:30:28,"And deep down in your heart, I don't think you do, either."
560,00:30:28,00:30:32,"If you thought this was a real relationship, you'd be shouting it from the rooftops, right?"
561,00:30:32,00:30:34,This is exactly why I didn't say anything to anyone.
562,00:30:34,00:30:37,Because I knew this is how you'd all react.
563,00:30:37,00:30:39,I just didn't expect it from you.
564,00:30:41,00:30:43,I love Elisabetta.
565,00:30:43,00:30:47,"Unless Immigration gets in the way, I'm going to marry her."
566,00:30:53,00:30:55,"Hey, what do you got?"
567,00:30:55,00:30:58,"Well, Hodges found traces of Claudia's blood on that Blossom Ballerina."
568,00:30:58,00:31:01,Lack of solubility suggested it was a very old blood sample.
569,00:31:01,00:31:03,So she did have it during the attack.
570,00:31:03,00:31:08,"Well, you know, even though Claudia was rescued, her mom never came looking for her."
571,00:31:08,00:31:12,"Yeah, well, maybe Mom and Brent never made it out of those woods. Exactly."
572,00:31:12,00:31:15,Hodges found something else mixed in with the blood.
573,00:31:15,00:31:18,"Sulfur. So, I've pulled up a map of Mount Charleston."
574,00:31:18,00:31:21,There are several sulfur springs in the area.
575,00:31:21,00:31:28,"Well, according to the police report, Simon Weber found Claudia on a service road just South of Echo Cliff."
576,00:31:30,00:31:33,There's a sulfur spring less than five miles from there.
577,00:31:33,00:31:37,"Yeah, let's get some ground-penetrating equipment out there, see what we can find."
578,00:31:47,00:31:48,WOMAN: Clear!
579,00:31:48,00:31:50,(oscillating tone)
580,00:31:50,00:31:52,MAN: Clear!
581,00:31:53,00:31:55,"Well, I have a hit."
582,00:32:02,00:32:04,(sighs)
583,00:32:04,00:32:07,Looks animal. Maybe coyote.
584,00:32:16,00:32:17,MAN: Clear.
585,00:32:25,00:32:28,"Hey, I got something."
586,00:32:30,00:32:32,That's too big to be an animal.
587,00:33:06,00:33:08,(sighs)
588,00:33:11,00:33:13,"One male, one female."
589,00:33:13,00:33:15,Yeah.
590,00:33:15,00:33:19,"Yeah, I think we just found Mom and Brent."
591,00:33:19,00:33:25,"Based on the dimensions of the injuries and the extent of the trauma, weapon used could have been some sort of wide-based tool."
592,00:33:25,00:33:26,Like a shovel?
593,00:33:26,00:33:28,"Yeah, injuries are consistent with a shovel."
594,00:33:28,00:33:30,Just like Claudia remembered.
595,00:33:30,00:33:33,Take a look at the extent of the injuries to the male.
596,00:33:33,00:33:36,Multiple depressed skull fractures...
597,00:33:36,00:33:39,ring fracture at the base of the skull.
598,00:33:39,00:33:41,He was nearly decapitated.
599,00:33:41,00:33:43,So he took the brunt of the killer's rage.
600,00:33:43,00:33:49,"Hey, got DNA results, and we've restored the I.D.s found at the grave site."
601,00:33:49,00:33:52,These are actually both Claudia's biological parents.
602,00:33:52,00:33:54,Both?
603,00:33:54,00:33:58,Meet Karen... and Martin Abbott.
604,00:34:00,00:34:01,Martin.
605,00:34:01,00:34:03,Who the hell's Brent?
606,00:34:03,00:34:04,FINLAY: Brent was their son.
607,00:34:04,00:34:07,Karen and Martin Abbott were from Montana.
608,00:34:07,00:34:10,"Brent was their oldest child, and when he was 12, they had Claudia."
609,00:34:10,00:34:12,"All-American family. Well, not exactly."
610,00:34:12,00:34:15,Martin Abbott had a record.
611,00:34:15,00:34:16,For what?
612,00:34:16,00:34:19,Assault and credit card fraud.
613,00:34:19,00:34:23,"When the family disappeared, he had several outstanding warrants."
614,00:34:23,00:34:25,Maybe that's why nobody reported the family missing.
615,00:34:25,00:34:26,Thought they just skipped town.
616,00:34:26,00:34:29,"Okay, Abbott family gets the hell out of Dodge."
617,00:34:29,00:34:32,They go camping up in Nevada.
618,00:34:32,00:34:39,"Parents end up dead, Claudia barely escapes with her life, and Brent-- nowhere to be found."
619,00:34:39,00:34:44,FINLAY: So Brent is either our killer or he is still buried out in those woods.
620,00:34:44,00:34:46,Claudia thought her brother was still alive.
621,00:34:46,00:34:47,I-I went through her phone records.
622,00:34:47,00:34:51,For the past few weeks she's been calling Brent Abbotts across the country.
623,00:34:51,00:34:54,She was calling Brent Abbotts up until the day she was killed.
624,00:34:54,00:34:55,I-I contacted a few of them.
625,00:34:55,00:35:01,Claudia asked them all the exact same question: were they on a camping trip 18 years ago?
626,00:35:01,00:35:05,What if one of these Brent Abbotts really was her brother?
627,00:35:05,00:35:09,And he got nervous that she was remembering what happened in those woods.
628,00:35:09,00:35:11,"That he killed their parents, tried to kill her."
629,00:35:11,00:35:14,So he returns to Vegas to shut her up for good.
630,00:35:14,00:35:17,"Got away with murder once, probably thought he could do it again."
631,00:35:17,00:35:21,"Only problem is, Claudia called at least 50 Brent Abbotts."
632,00:35:21,00:35:23,How do we figure out which one's our killer?
633,00:35:28,00:35:30,"Hey, Finn. Hi."
634,00:35:30,00:35:32,I've done some more checking into Martin Abbott.
635,00:35:32,00:35:35,"Now, according to his rap sheet, he's used several aliases."
636,00:35:35,00:35:37,One of them-- Ernest Prestwich.
637,00:35:37,00:35:39,Why does that sound familiar?
638,00:35:39,00:35:43,"Well, Ernest Prestwich is a janitor at the tennis center, but that's not his real name."
639,00:35:43,00:35:49,"According to his contact information, he has an L.A. cell registered to Brent Abbott."
640,00:35:49,00:35:54,So Brent used one of his dad's aliases but forgot to change his cell phone number.
641,00:35:54,00:35:57,I cross-referenced Claudia's phone records.
642,00:35:57,00:35:58,She called him a week ago.
643,00:35:58,00:36:00,That's great. Let's bring him in.
644,00:36:00,00:36:02,Patrol just picked him up at a service station.
645,00:36:02,00:36:06,"Looks like the past finally caught up to you, Brent."
646,00:36:06,00:36:10,"We found your parents' bodies on Mount Charleston, right where you buried 'em."
647,00:36:10,00:36:12,After you beat them to death with a shovel.
648,00:36:12,00:36:14,We get it.
649,00:36:14,00:36:16,Your old man was bad news.
650,00:36:16,00:36:17,I did some digging into your history.
651,00:36:17,00:36:20,I know you made a lot of trips to the ER.
652,00:36:20,00:36:25,I know that that son of a bitch beat the crap out of you since you were eight years old.
653,00:36:25,00:36:27,We understand.
654,00:36:27,00:36:31,"Yeah, the cops even came to your house a few times, and your mother never pressed charges."
655,00:36:31,00:36:33,She always covered for him.
656,00:36:33,00:36:41,She would always say that the bruises were from fights at school and the broken bones were from football.
657,00:36:41,00:36:47,And on this family camping trip you decided to end the abuse once and for all.
658,00:36:47,00:36:49,Am I right?
659,00:36:52,00:36:55,We were in the middle of the woods.
660,00:36:55,00:36:59,So I waited for everyone to fall asleep and I took out Dad first.
661,00:37:03,00:37:06,Your dad abused you and your mom did not protect you.
662,00:37:06,00:37:11,But why would you try to kill your four-year-old little sister?
663,00:37:11,00:37:14,I didn't mean to hurt Claudia.
664,00:37:14,00:37:17,I told her to wait in the tent; she didn't listen.
665,00:37:18,00:37:20,(grunting)
666,00:37:24,00:37:27,Claudia! Claudia!
667,00:37:27,00:37:29,I thought she was dead.
668,00:37:29,00:37:32,I went to dig the grave.
669,00:37:32,00:37:34,"When I turned around, she was gone."
670,00:37:34,00:37:37,But she saw what you did.
671,00:37:37,00:37:40,Is that why you showed up 18 years later and killed her?
672,00:37:42,00:37:45,I-I didn't kill her.
673,00:37:45,00:37:48,I-I-I looked her up and saw that she was playing in Vegas.
674,00:37:48,00:37:50,I didn't come here to kill her.
675,00:37:50,00:37:54,"I came here to, to talk to her, explain my side of the story."
676,00:37:54,00:37:57,Okay. What'd she say?
677,00:37:57,00:37:59,I didn't get a chance to talk to her.
678,00:37:59,00:38:02,"I went to the courts that night, and she wasn't there..."
679,00:38:02,00:38:04,so I left.
680,00:38:09,00:38:11,I didn't kill my sister.
681,00:38:11,00:38:15,G-give me a-a-a polygraph or take my DNA-- whatever it is you people do-- but I didn't kill Claudia.
682,00:38:19,00:38:21,What time did you leave the court?
683,00:38:21,00:38:22,"It, it was, like, 1:00."
684,00:38:22,00:38:24,Can anyone verify that?
685,00:38:26,00:38:28,It was pretty deserted.
686,00:38:28,00:38:33,"N-No, there was the other, uh, tennis player, though, um, Janssen, Tara Janssen."
687,00:38:33,00:38:35,She was there.
688,00:38:36,00:38:37,What was she doing?
689,00:38:37,00:38:39,"I don't know, practicing, I guess."
690,00:38:39,00:38:41,She had a basket full of tennis balls.
691,00:39:15,00:39:18,We found your prints in Claudia Weber's blood.
692,00:39:18,00:39:21,BRASS: Game. Set. Murder.
693,00:39:21,00:39:27,"RUSSELL: You know, I always thought that you just killed Claudia 'cause you were a sore loser, but..."
694,00:39:27,00:39:33,"murder over an off day seemed a bit extreme, so... we took a closer look."
695,00:39:33,00:39:39,"You know, I always wondered what players said to each other after a match, so we isolated and boosted the audio."
696,00:39:39,00:39:40,Good match.
697,00:39:40,00:39:43,"By the way, I'm sleeping with your husband."
698,00:39:45,00:39:47,"Ooh, that's cold."
699,00:39:47,00:39:49,I probably would have just stuck with a handshake.
700,00:39:50,00:39:55,"Out of curiosity, how long have you been involved with Ivan?"
701,00:39:56,00:39:59,Almost a year.
702,00:39:59,00:40:03,He and Claudia were having problems long before I came into the picture.
703,00:40:03,00:40:06,"So, instead of helping your friend, you helped yourself to her husband."
704,00:40:06,00:40:08,I loved him.
705,00:40:08,00:40:10,He was going to ask Claudia for a divorce.
706,00:40:10,00:40:12,That's why he went over there that night.
707,00:40:12,00:40:14,"I'm sorry, I know, she doesn't..."
708,00:40:14,00:40:21,JANSSEN: But instead he told her that he still loved her and that he wanted to work on their marriage.
709,00:40:22,00:40:26,Claudia agreed to give him a second chance.
710,00:40:26,00:40:29,She didn't even love him.
711,00:40:29,00:40:31,She just didn't want me to have him.
712,00:40:31,00:40:35,"That's enough to set anybody off, especially someone with a temper like yours."
713,00:40:35,00:40:38,She took everything from me that night.
714,00:40:38,00:40:41,She took the match and she took Ivan.
715,00:40:41,00:40:43,I hated her for that.
716,00:40:48,00:40:50,(both grunting)
717,00:40:57,00:40:59,(yells)
718,00:40:59,00:41:00,(sobs)
719,00:41:00,00:41:05,I killed her and I stuffed her body in the ball machine.
720,00:41:05,00:41:09,Me and Ivan-- we were good together.
721,00:41:10,00:41:12,We were.
722,00:41:12,00:41:14,She just should have walked away.
723,00:41:14,00:41:19,"Yeah, but she didn't, so you eliminated your competition on and off the court."
724,00:41:19,00:41:24,"So, instead of serving aces, all you'll be serving is time."
725,00:41:30,00:41:32,"Hey, glad I caught you."
726,00:41:32,00:41:36,"Oh, hi, I was just going to get dinner with my dad."
727,00:41:36,00:41:39,"Oh, tell him I said hi."
728,00:41:39,00:41:41,I just wanted to thank you.
729,00:41:41,00:41:46,My lawyer called and told me that you talked to Immigration; gave me a glowing character reference.
730,00:41:48,00:41:50,"Seemed like it couldn't hurt, right?"
731,00:41:50,00:41:52,Mm-hmm.
732,00:41:52,00:41:57,"Yeah, but you weren't exactly supportive of my relationship with Elisabetta."
733,00:41:59,00:42:01,(sighs)
734,00:42:01,00:42:07,"You're my friend, and I just want what's best for you, so, if she makes you happy, then it's good enough for me."
735,00:42:12,00:42:13,Thank you.
736,00:42:15,00:42:18,I should go.
737,00:42:18,00:42:20,Okay.
738,00:42:20,00:42:21,(sighs)
739,00:42:21,00:42:25,"FINLAY: So, I guess Tara Janssen will go down in the history books after all."
740,00:42:25,00:42:27,"Yeah, just not the way she wanted, I'm guessing."
741,00:42:27,00:42:28,Mm.
742,00:42:28,00:42:30,So now you can take her spot on the tour.
743,00:42:30,00:42:31,(laughs) That's funny.
744,00:42:31,00:42:33,"Now, don't be so modest."
745,00:42:33,00:42:35,I heard that Chris Evert said you had some real talent.
746,00:42:35,00:42:39,"Well, I did play a lot when I was a kid. You ever think about turning pro?"
747,00:42:39,00:42:42,"Oh, when I was 15, yeah, for a second."
748,00:42:42,00:42:43,What happened?
749,00:42:43,00:42:44,Life--life happened.
750,00:42:44,00:42:46,"Well, I'm glad it did."
751,00:42:46,00:42:48,"Yeah, me, too."
