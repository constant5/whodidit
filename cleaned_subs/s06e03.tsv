0	00:00:02	00:00:04	911. What is your emergency?
1	00:00:04	00:00:05	Yes. There's been an accident.
2	00:00:05	00:00:07	What kind of accident, sir?
3	00:00:07	00:00:08	Please, ma'am, I need you to send an ambulance.
4	00:00:08	00:00:09	Please, just hurry.
5	00:00:09	00:00:11	Sir, paramedics are en route.
6	00:00:11	00:00:13	Oh, my God! Please, you've got to help me!
7	00:00:13	00:00:14	Please, hurry!
8	00:00:14	00:00:15	Sir, where are you injured?
9	00:00:15	00:00:16	What? No, not me, my wife!
10	00:00:23	00:00:24	De-fib.
11	00:00:24	00:00:25	What does that mean?
12	00:00:25	00:00:27	Sir, please stand back.
13	00:00:42	00:00:45	There was an emergency call out, the paramedics responded.
14	00:00:45	00:00:48	They found Mrs. Lester in the back stairs.
15	00:00:48	00:00:52	16 a.m.
16	00:00:55	00:00:56	And, of course, you walked through the house.
17	00:00:56	00:00:58	We were responding to a traumatic injury.
18	00:00:58	00:01:00	Our priority was to assist the victim.
19	00:01:01	00:01:05	141, you cut off on the first and middle name...
20	00:01:13	00:01:15	That's Ray Lester, the vic's husband.
21	00:01:17	00:01:18	Was he injured?
22	00:01:18	00:01:23	No, uh, that's his wife's blood.
23	00:01:23	00:01:28	He said he checked to see if she was still alive and he held her until the paramedics came.
24	00:01:28	00:01:30	Wouldn't you?
25	00:01:30	00:01:33	You never met my ex.
26	00:01:43	00:01:45	Tequila will always remind me of Se√±or Frog's.
27	00:01:45	00:01:47	Which one?
28	00:01:47	00:01:50	Cancun. My honeymoon.
29	00:01:50	00:01:51	My dime.
30	00:01:51	00:01:54	Well, if you ever want to go back, it's on me.
31	00:01:54	00:01:56	Is that a proposal?
32	00:02:04	00:02:07	It's like the Red Sea in here.
33	00:02:07	00:02:10	The Red Sea's not red, David.
34	00:02:10	00:02:14	No, it's blue from afar and transparent when held in hand, like any other body of water.
35	00:02:14	00:02:16	I was just speaking figuratively.
36	00:02:16	00:02:19	I'm assuming those boot prints aren't yours.
37	00:02:20	00:02:22	Please, I was just waiting for you guys to clear a path.
38	00:02:22	00:02:24	Blame the paramedics.
39	00:02:24	00:02:27	This girl's head and spine are perfectly aligned.
40	00:02:27	00:02:32	Yeah, when you fall down the stairs, your head tends to go in one direction, your body in another.
41	00:02:32	00:02:35	I'll take a statement from the husband and the paramedics; see if she was moved.
42	00:02:35	00:02:40	You know, twice as many people die each year from falling down stairs than from accidental gunfire?
43	00:02:40	00:02:43	You didn't just get back from one of those coroner's conferences, did you?
44	00:02:47	00:02:48	What are you thinking?
45	00:02:48	00:02:50	Led Zeppelin.
46	00:02:52	00:02:54	Stairway To Heaven.
47	00:03:49	00:03:51	Hey, Sanders.
48	00:03:51	00:03:52	Hey.
49	00:03:52	00:03:53	Back stairs.
50	00:03:53	00:03:56	And, uh, you might want to hug the wall.
51	00:03:59	00:04:01	Whew!
52	00:04:01	00:04:03	Did you ever hear of Odor Eaters?
53	00:04:05	00:04:07	Never mind.
54	00:04:07	00:04:09	We don't get another boot allowance till spring.
55	00:04:09	00:04:12	Well, I'll try to get 'em back to you before your next shift, okay?
56	00:04:12	00:04:15	Did either of you guys move the body? Didn't have to.
57	00:04:15	00:04:19	She was faceup. I unbuttoned her blouse to apply the leads, but that's it.
58	00:04:19	00:04:20	We tried not to touch anything.
59	00:04:20	00:04:23	Once we saw that blood, we knew you'd be showing up.
60	00:04:24	00:04:26	Becky Lester.
61	00:04:26	00:04:31	Catherine and I got here a half an hour after her husband called 911.
62	00:04:31	00:04:34	Edges of the blood pools were already dry.
63	00:04:34	00:04:36	The pools themselves were tacky.
64	00:04:36	00:04:40	Which means she'd been down here at least an hour or two before you guys even got here.
65	00:04:40	00:04:43	Why did the husband wait so long to call?
66	00:04:43	00:04:44	Good question.
67	00:04:44	00:04:51	Coroner won't touch the body till Catherine and I are done processing around it, so, Sara, would you please go up the front stairs and work your way down the back stairs?
68	00:04:51	00:04:52	You got it.
69	00:04:52	00:04:56	Warrick, could you process the blood evidence from the front door to the back stairwell?
70	00:04:56	00:04:59	And if you'll notice, she doesn't have any blood on her feet.
71	00:04:59	00:05:02	So I can assume those bloody footprints aren't hers.
72	00:05:02	00:05:06	Nick, Brass is in the study with the husband and he's waiting for you.
73	00:06:22	00:06:27	Hey, Grissom, spatter on the wall doesn't exceed 18 inches.
74	00:06:27	00:06:30	Well, that's consistent with the fall.
75	00:06:37	00:06:45	Guys, if she fell, even if she was pushed down these stairs, I would expect to find smudge marks on these walls.
76	00:06:45	00:06:48	Yeah, she would've instinctively reached out for leverage.
77	00:06:48	00:06:49	There are none.
78	00:06:49	00:06:54	Not to mention, that if she was up here before she was down there...
79	00:06:55	00:06:58	...she should've landed headfirst.
80	00:07:00	00:07:04	The body position is inconsistent with the fall.
81	00:07:04	00:07:06	Well, it's inconsistent if she fell down the stairs.
82	00:07:08	00:07:10	Maybe she fell up.
83	00:07:19	00:07:22	Catherine, can I borrow your micrometer?
84	00:07:27	00:07:31	Blood spatter measures two millimeters.
85	00:07:31	00:07:32	Medium spatter.
86	00:07:32	00:07:35	Suggests impact with a blunt object.
87	00:07:38	00:07:41	But if she was hit, where's the castoff?
88	00:07:45	00:07:46	It is a low ceiling.
89	00:07:46	00:07:48	Pretty hard to swing a weapon.
90	00:07:48	00:07:51	Sometimes first blush gives you a head rush.
91	00:07:52	00:07:55	I don't think I moved her.
92	00:07:55	00:07:57	I mean, I cradled her head in my lap.
93	00:07:58	00:08:01	Tried to wake her up, but that's it.
94	00:08:01	00:08:05	So, you and your wife went to Pieros for dinner, 00.
95	00:08:05	00:08:07	Got out the tequila, then what?
96	00:08:07	00:08:09	I, you know, got comfortable...
97	00:08:10	00:08:12	then we went outside and did a few shots.
98	00:08:12	00:08:14	How'd the tequila get back inside?
99	00:08:14	00:08:17	Um, the phone rang and it was my daughter Susan.
100	00:08:17	00:08:18	Your daughter?
101	00:08:18	00:08:21	Yeah, from my first marriage.
102	00:08:21	00:08:23	She's, she's staying at Becky's dad's.
103	00:08:23	00:08:26	All right. It's Susan.
104	00:08:26	00:08:29	Oh. Hey, babe.
105	00:08:29	00:08:30	Uh-huh.
106	00:08:30	00:08:32	Okay.
107	00:08:32	00:08:34	It's boy trouble.
108	00:08:35	00:08:36	I'll take this inside.
109	00:08:39	00:08:40	What did you do after that?
110	00:08:40	00:08:45	Another shot or two and then I guess I fell asleep.
111	00:08:45	00:08:47	And I woke up around midnight.
112	00:08:47	00:08:50	And I figured that she and Susan had just gotten into one of their talk-a-thons.
113	00:08:52	00:08:56	I took the tequila and the glasses into the kitchen and that's when I saw her.
114	00:08:56	00:08:57	Oh, my God.
115	00:08:59	00:09:01	Oh, please! Oh, please, please!
116	00:09:01	00:09:05	Oh, my God... Oh, my God...
117	00:09:11	00:09:16	Now, is there any reason you can think of why your wife would be using the back stairs?
118	00:09:16	00:09:18	From the kitchen, it's closer to the bedroom.
119	00:09:18	00:09:20	You never mentioned anything about the bedroom.
120	00:09:20	00:09:22	Are you trying to trip me up or something?
121	00:09:22	00:09:23	I mean, I don't...
122	00:09:23	00:09:26	maybe she went to, uh, brush her teeth or put on her nightgown. I really don't know.
123	00:09:27	00:09:29	Okay, sir. I'm going to need to take your clothing.
124	00:09:31	00:09:33	I'll go upstairs and change.
125	00:09:33	00:09:36	No, that's okay. We're still processing upstairs.
126	00:09:36	00:09:38	You can remove them right here and I'll give you a jumpsuit.
127	00:09:39	00:09:40	I'll close my eyes, if you're shy.
128	00:09:51	00:09:54	Those don't look like mosquito bites.
129	00:09:56	00:09:59	My wife likes to bite, and I don't mind it, okay?
130	00:09:59	00:10:01	Okay.
131	00:10:12	00:10:19	Okay, the husband says he fell asleep, he woke up his wife was dead.
132	00:10:19	00:10:21	He's a good sleeper.
133	00:10:21	00:10:23	Yeah, I'm sure he's gonna say something like that.
134	00:10:23	00:10:24	Anyway, there's a daughter.
135	00:10:24	00:10:27	She spent the night at her grandfather's, who lives a few blocks away.
136	00:10:27	00:10:28	I'm gonna check it out.
137	00:10:28	00:10:29	I'm ready.
138	00:10:33	00:10:36	The blue markers denote the footprints.
139	00:10:36	00:10:38	They're all consistent with the husband.
140	00:10:49	00:10:51	The footprints are associated with gravitational blood drops.
141	00:10:59	00:11:02	The yellow markers denote the paramedics' boot prints.
142	00:11:10	00:11:12	And what about this here, on the counter?
143	00:11:12	00:11:13	It's a single blood drop.
144	00:11:13	00:11:16	I'm thinking that's from when the husband reached for the phone.
145	00:11:19	00:11:21	That's a good observation.
146	00:11:21	00:11:23	What do you got in the bag?
147	00:11:23	00:11:27	This...
148	00:11:27	00:11:29	is a bloody paper towel I found in the trash.
149	00:11:29	00:11:34	It's too textured to print, but Sanders talked to the paramedics, who confirmed that it wasn't theirs.
150	00:11:34	00:11:38	I'm thinking it was from the husband when he tried to clean up and saw it wouldn't be too easy.
151	00:11:38	00:11:39	Lucky for us.
152	00:12:29	00:12:31	Hey.
153	00:12:33	00:12:34	Husband slept in the other room.
154	00:12:35	00:12:36	His reading glasses are on the nightstand.
155	00:12:37	00:12:38	Clothing's in the dresser.
156	00:12:38	00:12:40	That's odd.
157	00:12:40	00:12:53	A man and a woman, who don't share a bedroom, arrange to have a night alone, send their daughter to a relative, go out to dinner, have drinks by the pool, but they sleep in separate bedrooms.
158	00:12:53	00:13:01	Maybe one of them snored or had insomnia or liked to work at night.
159	00:13:02	00:13:06	Or maybe they were suffocating each other and he couldn't breathe.
160	00:13:15	00:13:16	Sexual lubricant.
161	00:13:16	00:13:20	It's half empty. Sticky.
162	00:13:20	00:13:27	You know, you don't have to sleep in the same bed together to have sex or...
163	00:13:27	00:13:29	have romance.
164	00:13:31	00:13:34	I'm going to go see the doctor.
165	00:13:37	00:13:38	I'll grid the house.
166	00:13:45	00:13:47	I don't understand.
167	00:13:47	00:13:51	Becky was in perfect health.
168	00:13:51	00:13:52	Can I see her?
169	00:13:52	00:13:53	I'd like to see my daughter.
170	00:13:53	00:13:55	Well, her body's with the coroner, sir.
171	00:13:55	00:13:58	There will be an autopsy as a part of our investigation.
172	00:13:58	00:14:00	But you said she fell.
173	00:14:00	00:14:06	Yeah, um, if you don't mind, I'd like to ask you both a few questions.
174	00:14:06	00:14:10	Anything. When was the last time either of you saw her?
175	00:14:10	00:14:14	When she dropped Susan off yesterday evening, she came in for a few minutes.
176	00:14:14	00:14:17	Said she was headed home and out to dinner with Ray.
177	00:14:17	00:14:19	And that's the last time you spoke with her.
178	00:14:19	00:14:21	Yeah. No.
179	00:14:23	00:14:25	I called her.
180	00:14:25	00:14:28	00, after Grandpa went to bed.
181	00:14:28	00:14:29	What did you talk about?
182	00:14:29	00:14:30	Why is that important?
183	00:14:31	00:14:32	Well...
184	00:14:32	00:14:35	Stupid stuff.
185	00:14:35	00:14:39	My best friend Jamila and I, we both like Leon.
186	00:14:39	00:14:42	And I know, friendship first.
187	00:14:42	00:14:45	I just wanted Becky to say it, you know?
188	00:14:45	00:14:48	Uh, yeah, okay.
189	00:14:48	00:14:50	Thank you. Thank you, Susan.
190	00:14:50	00:14:52	Susan, would you give me a moment with the detective?
191	00:14:53	00:14:55	Okay.
192	00:14:57	00:15:02	You said you found my daughter's body on the stairwell?
193	00:15:02	00:15:04	That's right.
194	00:15:04	00:15:09	You're aware that Ray's first wife, Susan's mother, was found the same way?
195	00:15:09	00:15:12	Well, now I am.
196	00:15:12	00:15:15	They said Susan's mom died of a stroke.
197	00:15:15	00:15:16	But you don't think so?
198	00:15:16	00:15:18	I never had any reason to doubt it.
199	00:15:18	00:15:22	So how would you, uh, how would you characterize your daughter's marriage?
200	00:15:22	00:15:24	Ups and downs.
201	00:15:24	00:15:26	About a year ago, Ray's business went under.
202	00:15:26	00:15:30	And Becky works for Western Airlines.
203	00:15:30	00:15:31	They've been downsizing since 9/11.
204	00:15:31	00:15:32	It's been rough.
205	00:15:33	00:15:34	Yeah.
206	00:15:35	00:15:39	Mr. Stein, does your son-in-law have a temper?
207	00:15:39	00:15:40	Do I have to answer that?
208	00:15:41	00:15:42	You just did.
209	00:15:42	00:15:48	Becky Lester, 32. Final meal, pasta.
210	00:15:48	00:15:53	I can't tell you the variety of the noodle, but there was a white sauce with clams.
211	00:15:53	00:15:56	And I found some blood in her stomach.
212	00:15:56	00:15:58	Her tongue was lacerated perimortem.
213	00:15:59	00:16:01	She probably chomped down on it when she hit the stairs.
214	00:16:01	00:16:04	I sent a blood sample to tox and Nick asked for teeth impressions.
215	00:16:04	00:16:06	Husband claims she's a biter.
216	00:16:06	00:16:10	Fine line between pleasure and pain.
217	00:16:10	00:16:13	But who doesn't like to cross it every once in a while, right?
218	00:16:13	00:16:20	Anyway, um, I don't know if it's probative, but there's semen in her vaginal vault.
219	00:16:20	00:16:26	Sperm motility and positive acid phosphates suggest intercourse approximately six to 12 hours prior to death.
220	00:16:26	00:16:28	Yeah, I'm mostly interested in cause.
221	00:16:31	00:16:35	Two to the forehead, one to the right temple, and two to the occipital bone.
222	00:16:35	00:16:36	Are they consistent with a fall?
223	00:16:36	00:16:40	Yes, but I'd expect to see hand fractures as a result of the impact, and there are none.
224	00:16:40	00:16:42	Are they consistent with blunt force trauma?
225	00:16:42	00:16:45	Sure, but if the husband bludgeoned her, there'd be fractures to the skull.
226	00:16:47	00:16:48	And there are none.
227	00:16:48	00:16:49	None.
228	00:16:49	00:16:54	Well, you've given me a lot of information, Doc, and none of it very helpful.
229	00:17:08	00:17:10	You want fries with that?
230	00:17:13	00:17:16	Robbins said the vic bit her tongue.
231	00:17:16	00:17:22	Theoretically, she could've expirated the blood on the wall, providing an alternative explanation for the medium velocity spatter.
232	00:17:23	00:17:25	Do me a favor, check it out.
233	00:17:33	00:17:35	Well, it looks like two millimeters.
234	00:17:35	00:17:39	Same as the blood at the scene.
235	00:17:39	00:17:42	So, maybe it was just an accident.
236	00:17:45	00:17:48	As she tried to get up, she expirated the blood on the wall.
237	00:17:48	00:17:55	She failed to regain her footing, impacting her temple and then she bounced on her occipital bone.
238	00:17:55	00:17:59	So we've got two theories, both supported by physical evidence.
239	00:17:59	00:18:02	Yeah, if we ever find a murder weapon, my theory's done.
240	00:18:02	00:18:08	Well, I know that there was no blood found in the car, so it's unlikely that Ray took a drive to dispose of the weapon.
241	00:18:10	00:18:11	Hey, ready for a quiz?
242	00:18:11	00:18:13	Guess how Ray's first wife died?
243	00:18:13	00:18:16	Wait. She had a stroke on a stairway.
244	00:18:17	00:18:18	Robbins told me.
245	00:18:19	00:18:20	Is that the autopsy report?
246	00:18:20	00:18:23	No, these are medical records. There was no autopsy.
247	00:18:23	00:18:24	Jackie Lester had a heart condition.
248	00:18:25	00:18:28	Three weeks before she died, she was admitted to a hospital with vertigo.
249	00:18:28	00:18:31	She ignored the doctor's warnings, didn't take her medication.
250	00:18:31	00:18:33	Family physician pronounced it a stroke.
251	00:18:33	00:18:39	Well, if she wasn't cremated, it's not too late for a postmortem examination.
252	00:18:39	00:18:41	Judge Witherspoon is issuing a court order for exhumation.
253	00:18:41	00:18:43	Now, look, I just came from the DA.
254	00:18:43	00:18:45	I gotta tell you, he's already made up his mind.
255	00:18:45	00:18:48	Husband and wife, home alone, all that blood, shaky alibi.
256	00:18:48	00:18:50	Plus, he says, He just looks guilty.
257	00:18:50	00:18:53	How does one look guilty?
258	00:18:53	00:18:55	You know, I'm just a messenger.
259	00:18:55	00:18:58	What do you think the chances are he didn't do it?
260	00:18:58	00:19:02	Well, what do you think the chances are we're going to give you an answer before all the evidence is in?
261	00:19:02	00:19:04	Greg...
262	00:19:04	00:19:07	Becky Lester had a B.A.L. of point one-eight.
263	00:19:07	00:19:09	And I found trace amounts of Diazepam.
264	00:19:09	00:19:10	Thanks!
265	00:19:10	00:19:13	Hey, I heard the coroner found semen, so I tested for birth control.
266	00:19:13	00:19:15	Estrogen and progesterone levels were spiked.
267	00:19:15	00:19:17	Where did you hear about the coroner's findings?
268	00:19:17	00:19:19	Actually, I read the report.
269	00:19:19	00:19:21	Maybe I don't want to be a toxicologist my whole life.
270	00:19:21	00:19:25	I mean, you went from DNA to the field, and I guess you're kind of a role model to me.
271	00:19:25	00:19:26	A role model, huh?
272	00:19:26	00:19:29	Yeah. By the way, where do you get your hair cut?
273	00:20:13	00:20:14	Quick. How many teeth in the human mouth?
274	00:20:14	00:20:16	Without wisdoms? 28.
275	00:20:16	00:20:22	Yep, and the 28 teeth in Becky's mouth do not match the bite impressions on her husband's body.
276	00:20:22	00:20:25	I guess Ray found himself another set of pearly whites.
277	00:20:25	00:20:29	Look, I loved my wife.
278	00:20:29	00:20:35	But, a year into our marriage, she told me that she wasn't into sex anymore.
279	00:20:35	00:20:39	And, uh, she went frigid on me.
280	00:20:39	00:20:41	Asked me to move into the other bedroom.
281	00:20:42	00:20:44	And you were okay with that?
282	00:20:44	00:20:47	Well, I kept hoping things would get better.
283	00:20:47	00:20:51	And we had fun and we respected each other.
284	00:20:51	00:20:54	And she was a great mom to Susan.
285	00:20:54	00:20:56	I'm still confused about the bite marks.
286	00:20:56	00:20:59	I found a way to make our relationship work.
287	00:20:59	00:21:01	You found yourself a vampire?
288	00:21:01	00:21:03	I met a girl online.
289	00:21:03	00:21:05	She liked biting. I liked being bit.
290	00:21:05	00:21:08	It just seemed like a good match, and it never got sexual.
291	00:21:08	00:21:10	Uh-huh.
292	00:21:10	00:21:13	And, uh, what is her name?
293	00:21:13	00:21:19	I know her as Buffy227@gmail.com.
294	00:21:20	00:21:22	And your wife never suspected anything?
295	00:21:22	00:21:26	We'd meet at a motel... every few weeks.
296	00:21:26	00:21:28	I'd tell Becky that I was going out for a bite.
297	00:21:30	00:21:33	It was consensual and it wasn't sexual.
298	00:21:33	00:21:35	It was not cheating.
299	00:21:35	00:21:38	But you never told your wife?
300	00:21:38	00:21:42	I didn't tell Becky everything I did every minute of the day, but that doesn't mean that I was unfaithful.
301	00:21:43	00:21:47	When, exactly, was the last time that you had sexual intercourse with your late wife?
302	00:21:47	00:21:48	Four years ago.
303	00:21:51	00:21:54	Rosy Palm and Thumbelina are the only action that I get.
304	00:21:56	00:22:02	Uh, wow, you know, uh, a joke like that doesn't quite seem appropriate for a distraught husband.
305	00:22:02	00:22:03	I'm just answering the questions.
306	00:22:05	00:22:11	Mr. Lester, did you know that your wife was having an affair?
307	00:22:15	00:22:17	The day that she died, she had had intercourse.
308	00:22:21	00:22:23	Are we done here?
309	00:22:23	00:22:25	For now.
310	00:22:30	00:22:33	Ow... ooh.
311	00:22:33	00:22:35	She's hot.
312	00:22:36	00:22:38	But I still wouldn't let her fang me.
313	00:22:38	00:22:41	No, no. I'm with you.
314	00:22:41	00:22:43	Was the video encrypted?
315	00:22:43	00:22:45	Uh, no.
316	00:22:45	00:22:49	I was processing Ray's computer and it was just sitting on the desktop...
317	00:22:49	00:22:51	in a folder called Dental Records.
318	00:22:51	00:22:53	Did you get an I.D. on Buffy?
319	00:22:53	00:22:54	Grissom got us an administrative subpoena.
320	00:22:57	00:23:03	Dr. Jeri Cohen-- aka Buffy227-- is a dentist.
321	00:23:03	00:23:05	Are you kidding me?
322	00:23:05	00:23:07	I could not make this stuff up.
323	00:23:08	00:23:11	I'm not ashamed of my predilection.
324	00:23:11	00:23:15	Assuming both parties are healthy, biting can be orgasmic.
325	00:23:15	00:23:17	Huh.
326	00:23:17	00:23:19	Dr. Cohen, where were you last night?
327	00:23:19	00:23:22	Home alone, like most nights.
328	00:23:22	00:23:25	Ma'am, we're here to talk about your relationship with Ray Lester.
329	00:23:25	00:23:27	Well, I wouldn't call it a relationship, per se.
330	00:23:27	00:23:29	There was no sex, no commitment.
331	00:23:29	00:23:32	We'd meet at a motel room, once or twice a month.
332	00:23:32	00:23:36	You e-mailed Ray digital video of your sessions together.
333	00:23:36	00:23:42	Ray bought me that camera for, uh, my birthday.
334	00:23:42	00:23:43	It was fun.
335	00:23:46	00:23:47	If you say so.
336	00:23:47	00:23:53	The Kama Sutra says that any place on the body that can be kissed can also be bitten.
337	00:23:53	00:23:58	Except the upper lip, the interior of the mouth, and, of course, the eye.
338	00:23:58	00:24:03	It also goes on to describe eight different ways to bite your partner.
339	00:24:03	00:24:05	Ray liked the broken cloud.
340	00:24:05	00:24:07	Teeth...
341	00:24:07	00:24:10	are sexual organs.
342	00:24:10	00:24:12	Um, Dr. Cohen, did, uh...
343	00:24:12	00:24:15	did, uh... Ray.
344	00:24:15	00:24:17	...Ray ever mention his wife?
345	00:24:17	00:24:19	He told me he was married.
346	00:24:19	00:24:20	It wasn't a problem for me.
347	00:24:20	00:24:24	He said they made better friends than lovers and she was a good mother, that's about it.
348	00:24:24	00:24:27	Was he violent? Ray?
349	00:24:27	00:24:29	No, he was nothing like that.
350	00:24:33	00:24:34	See?
351	00:24:35	00:24:36	No bite marks.
352	00:24:36	00:24:38	I'm the aggressor.
353	00:24:38	00:24:40	Ray just lies there and takes it.
354	00:24:40	00:24:42	He's a real sweetheart.
355	00:24:45	00:24:46	Uh, ma'am...
356	00:24:51	00:24:53	Would you mind biting down on this for me?
357	00:24:53	00:24:56	You know I wouldn't.
358	00:24:58	00:25:02	They don't tell you about this part of the job when you're training to become a CSI.
359	00:25:03	00:25:06	Come on, after five years, at least they don't smell anymore.
360	00:25:06	00:25:08	Always with the silver lining.
361	00:25:08	00:25:09	Right.
362	00:25:09	00:25:11	You ready?
363	00:25:14	00:25:15	Well, hello, Jackie Lester.
364	00:25:15	00:25:18	On three.
365	00:25:21	00:25:23	One... two...
366	00:25:24	00:25:26	Three.
367	00:25:31	00:25:34	If you two don't mind...
368	00:25:36	00:25:38	...we'd like some alone time.
369	00:26:44	00:26:45	You done with your alone time, Doc?
370	00:26:45	00:26:48	Just completed my prelim, but check this out.
371	00:26:48	00:26:53	Subgaleal hemorrhages, consistent with lacerations to the occipital bone.
372	00:26:53	00:26:58	So both of Ray's wives end up dead at the bottom of the stairs with lacerations to the head.
373	00:26:58	00:27:03	If my full autopsy confirms murder, you maybe looking at the first serial stairway killer.
374	00:27:03	00:27:06	If there was a murder weapon, it was not in that house.
375	00:27:06	00:27:07	We searched everywhere.
376	00:27:07	00:27:08	What's in the bag?
377	00:27:08	00:27:10	Sex lube, found at the crime scene.
378	00:27:10	00:27:12	Autopsy revealed that Becky was sexually active.
379	00:27:12	00:27:15	Ray claims that they've both been celibate for the past four years.
380	00:27:15	00:27:19	And you wanted to see if her lover's prints were on that bottle.
381	00:27:19	00:27:22	Two viable prints, both in a light coat of lube.
382	00:27:22	00:27:24	One was Becky's and the other is an Adam Gilford.
383	00:27:24	00:27:26	Work card is in the system.
384	00:27:26	00:27:28	He's an executive at Western Airlines.
385	00:27:28	00:27:31	Lovers and co-workers. That never works.
386	00:27:31	00:27:35	If Ray did find out about the affair, that's motive.
387	00:27:35	00:27:38	Of course I knew Becky Lester.
388	00:27:38	00:27:40	I'm her boss. I'm the one who hired her.
389	00:27:40	00:27:43	Hard to believe that was six years ago.
390	00:27:43	00:27:46	And it's such a tragedy.
391	00:27:46	00:27:48	She was loved.
392	00:27:48	00:27:50	By some more than others.
393	00:27:50	00:27:52	Excuse me?
394	00:27:52	00:27:55	Mr. Gilford, we know that the two of you were sleeping together.
395	00:27:55	00:27:59	Becky wasn't in love with Ray.
396	00:27:59	00:28:02	They'd stopped having sex.
397	00:28:02	00:28:05	If they divorced, she'd owe him alimony, and Becky didn't think that was right.
398	00:28:05	00:28:07	Becky told you that?
399	00:28:07	00:28:08	She told me everything.
400	00:28:08	00:28:10	She and Ray were living on vapors.
401	00:28:10	00:28:12	They'd just taken a second on the house.
402	00:28:12	00:28:17	She also told me that Ray was hiding money from her-- the insurance payout on his first wife.
403	00:28:17	00:28:22	Look, if you suspect she was murdered, I can tell you why Ray did it.
404	00:28:22	00:28:24	We're listening.
405	00:28:24	00:28:28	At Western Airlines, VP's and above receive corporate life insurance policies.
406	00:28:28	00:28:30	Quarter mil payouts.
407	00:28:30	00:28:33	Last week, a round of pink slips went out.
408	00:28:33	00:28:35	We both got hit.
409	00:28:35	00:28:37	Two weeks, she would have been out of here.
410	00:28:38	00:28:40	And the insurance policy, suspended.
411	00:28:40	00:28:41	And Ray is the beneficiary.
412	00:28:42	00:28:45	He killed her just in time to make a killing.
413	00:28:55	00:29:03	DA's planning to file charges against Ray Lester-- tomorrow, after an ADA stops by the crime lab for a full briefing.
414	00:29:03	00:29:05	That's too soon.
415	00:29:05	00:29:07	Tell me about the first wife.
416	00:29:07	00:29:12	Preliminary investigations suggests foul play, but we've got nothing definitive until she's fully posted.
417	00:29:12	00:29:16	And the physical evidence in Becky Lester's death is completely ambiguous.
418	00:29:16	00:29:21	The DA figures he'll make a headline while you find corroborating evidence.
419	00:29:21	00:29:23	You think he's guilty, right?
420	00:29:23	00:29:25	I don't think that yet.
421	00:29:25	00:29:27	Oh, um, am I interrupting?
422	00:29:27	00:29:30	No. Brass just called with a heads up.
423	00:29:30	00:29:33	Since when does the DA's office tell us when we're ready?
424	00:29:33	00:29:37	When the case is high profile and the DA is feeling heat from the sheriff.
425	00:29:37	00:29:39	Look, you'll just walk him through the evidence.
426	00:29:39	00:29:42	You won't bias your reports or skip anything ambiguous.
427	00:29:42	00:29:43	It is what it is.
428	00:29:43	00:29:47	If the DA wants to shoot his wad too early, we can't stop him.
429	00:29:47	00:29:49	Okay.
430	00:29:53	00:29:55	Sarah and I may have uncovered motive.
431	00:29:55	00:29:59	In the last two weeks, Ray filled out five loan applications.
432	00:29:59	00:30:01	200 G's a pop. All denied.
433	00:30:01	00:30:07	With his wife dead, he is the beneficiary of a $250,000 policy.
434	00:30:07	00:30:08	Huh.
435	00:30:08	00:30:11	I wonder what he needed the money for.
436	00:30:11	00:30:15	I was... being blackmailed.
437	00:30:15	00:30:17	Um, someone found out about Buffy.
438	00:30:17	00:30:21	I... I got a letter and a photo in the mail.
439	00:30:21	00:30:24	They wanted 200 grand or the....
440	00:30:24	00:30:30	Otherwise, they'd share your biting secret with your wife.
441	00:30:30	00:30:32	Yeah.
442	00:30:33	00:30:35	Our marriage was having enough problems.
443	00:30:35	00:30:37	I mean, you're covered in those bite marks.
444	00:30:37	00:30:39	Didn't your wife ever ask where they came from?
445	00:30:39	00:30:42	She hadn't seen me naked in a long time.
446	00:30:42	00:30:47	I just... I would've been humiliated if she found out about Buffy.
447	00:30:47	00:30:49	She was a great mom.
448	00:30:51	00:30:55	And she kept... she kept me sane when my business went under.
449	00:30:55	00:30:58	You still have the blackmail note?
450	00:30:58	00:31:00	Yeah. I couldn't risk letting Becky find it.
451	00:31:00	00:31:03	Soon as I opened that letter, it went right into my briefcase.
452	00:31:03	00:31:04	I've got the only key.
453	00:31:12	00:31:20	Send $200,000 to P.O. Box 4976, Searchlight, Nevada, 89431 within two weeks or I'll send photos to your wife.
454	00:31:21	00:31:26	P.O. Box was through a private company, paid for in cash Abe Lincoln.
455	00:31:26	00:31:29	Ninhydrin picked up six distinct prints.
456	00:31:29	00:31:31	Five were matched to Ray.
457	00:31:31	00:31:32	What about the sixth?
458	00:31:33	00:31:35	Becky Lester.
459	00:31:35	00:31:36	Hold on.
460	00:31:36	00:31:40	Ray told Brass that Becky never saw that note, which means he was lying.
461	00:31:40	00:31:46	If she read the note, then it's possible that Ray freaked out, bludgeoned her to death.
462	00:31:46	00:31:48	What if Ray's telling the truth?
463	00:31:48	00:31:52	Well, Catherine, if he was, her fingerprints would not be on this note.
464	00:31:52	00:31:56	Unless she touched the letter before it was sent, which would make her the sender.
465	00:31:56	00:31:58	Well, that doesn't make any sense.
466	00:31:58	00:32:00	Becky thought that Ray was squirreling away money.
467	00:32:00	00:32:03	Maybe this is her way of getting her hands on it.
468	00:32:03	00:32:05	She used his fetish against him?
469	00:32:05	00:32:09	She blackmailed her own husband, knowing that he would pay up, so she wouldn't find out his secret.
470	00:32:09	00:32:11	That's ingenious.
471	00:32:11	00:32:12	And really sad.
472	00:32:12	00:32:14	( chuckles ) If it's true.
473	00:32:14	00:32:19	Well, if Becky's saliva's on that envelope, it's indisputable.
474	00:32:27	00:32:28	This is a blood clot.
475	00:32:28	00:32:29	Take a look.
476	00:32:31	00:32:33	Huh. The blood's continuous.
477	00:32:33	00:32:34	Comes from deep within the parenchyma.
478	00:32:34	00:32:37	The first wife had a stroke and it was fatal.
479	00:32:37	00:32:39	What about the scalp lacerations?
480	00:32:39	00:32:40	Perimortum.
481	00:32:40	00:32:43	So she must've hit her head on the stairs on the way down.
482	00:32:43	00:32:48	Well, I can't tell you about the second wife, but this was a natural.
483	00:33:01	00:33:02	That's the Western Airlines logo.
484	00:33:02	00:33:07	Over the past few years, corporations have begun embedding their insignia into the stationery for security purposes.
485	00:33:08	00:33:11	If Becky wrote the note, she wrote it at work.
486	00:33:11	00:33:12	This is Catherine.
487	00:33:12	00:33:14	Oh, yeah. I'm on my way.
488	00:33:16	00:33:18	For the record, I think you're filing prematurely.
489	00:33:18	00:33:21	As always, I value your opinion.
490	00:33:21	00:33:23	But I'm confident in our decision to move forward.
491	00:33:23	00:33:31	But, come on, Grissom, granted the first death was a natural-- but two dead women, married to the same guy, found in a stairwell?
492	00:33:31	00:33:33	Lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice.
493	00:33:33	00:33:35	Actually, it does.
494	00:33:35	00:33:37	The Empire State Building gets struck 20 times a year.
495	00:33:38	00:33:40	Let's just run the case.
496	00:33:40	00:33:44	Sorry, I got held up.
497	00:33:44	00:33:45	No, you're just in time.
498	00:33:45	00:33:49	Ms. Willows, would you bring Mr. Sinclair up to speed?
499	00:33:50	00:33:52	I'd be happy to.
500	00:33:52	00:33:56	Ray and Becky Lester were unhappily married.
501	00:33:56	00:34:01	She was having an affair with her boss, he was indulging his biting fetish.
502	00:34:01	00:34:03	They were having financial problems.
503	00:34:03	00:34:06	But Becky believed that Ray was hiding money.
504	00:34:06	00:34:13	Two weeks ago, Ray received a blackmail note demanding 200 grand or the wife finds out about Bite Girl.
505	00:34:13	00:34:19	Well, we have just confirmed that the blackmailer and the wife are one and the same.
506	00:34:19	00:34:22	Based on what?
507	00:34:22	00:34:23	The envelope of the ransom note.
508	00:34:23	00:34:24	DNA was a match.
509	00:34:25	00:34:27	The wife was blackmailing the husband?
510	00:34:28	00:34:32	Never underestimate the deviousness of a malcontented spouse.
511	00:34:32	00:34:34	He found out and he killed her.
512	00:34:34	00:34:36	We don't have any evidence to support that.
513	00:34:36	00:34:37	Run the timeline.
514	00:34:40	00:34:42	00 p.m.
515	00:34:42	00:34:44	They went outside and had some tequila.
516	00:34:44	00:34:48	08, Ray's daughter from his first marriage phoned.
517	00:34:48	00:34:50	Becky went inside to take the call.
518	00:34:50	00:34:52	How long did they talk?
519	00:34:54	00:34:56	It's not in Brass' notes.
520	00:34:56	00:34:59	Well, I have the phone records here, so...
521	00:34:59	00:35:02	Uh, the call lasted...
522	00:35:02	00:35:05	two minutes?!
523	00:35:05	00:35:08	I thought the husband told Nick it was a marathon call.
524	00:35:08	00:35:11	Yeah, I'm just seeing this for the first time here. Um...
525	00:35:11	00:35:15	The incoming call did not come from the grandfather's house.
526	00:35:15	00:35:18	I'm gonna call this number.
527	00:35:22	00:35:25	You've reached the home office of Ray Lester.
528	00:35:25	00:35:27	Please leave your details after the beep.
529	00:35:28	00:35:31	Susan called her stepmother from inside the house.
530	00:35:31	00:35:33	Did anybody process that office phone?
531	00:35:33	00:35:36	The office was away from the crime scene.
532	00:35:36	00:35:41	We, uh, checked it for a murder weapon, but that's about it.
533	00:35:43	00:35:45	I'll get an investigator over there.
534	00:35:47	00:35:49	Unless you're in too much of a hurry.
535	00:35:56	00:35:58	There it is.
536	00:36:10	00:36:12	Greg...
537	00:36:12	00:36:15	there's a fingerprint in blood.
538	00:36:19	00:36:21	Detective, what's going on?
539	00:36:22	00:36:23	Mr. Stein, where's Susan?
540	00:36:23	00:36:25	Is everything okay with Dad?
541	00:36:25	00:36:26	We have a warrant to search your house.
542	00:36:26	00:36:28	A warrant?! What?
543	00:36:28	00:36:31	Would you both please step outside with this officer?
544	00:36:31	00:36:32	Can I get my homework?
545	00:36:32	00:36:34	Well, uh...
546	00:36:34	00:36:36	Sure.
547	00:36:36	00:36:38	That'd be all right.
548	00:36:38	00:36:39	Okay.
549	00:36:48	00:36:50	I'm gonna need to see inside your backpack.
550	00:36:50	00:36:52	It's just my books and stuff.
551	00:36:52	00:36:54	I'd like to see what you're studying.
552	00:37:20	00:37:22	What did you hit her with?
553	00:37:31	00:37:34	I want to talk to my dad.
554	00:37:34	00:37:36	Why don't we take a ride downtown.
555	00:37:36	00:37:37	You can call him from there.
556	00:37:40	00:37:41	Nice work.
557	00:38:51	00:38:53	My stepmom was a bitch.
558	00:38:53	00:38:55	Susan, you're not helping.
559	00:38:55	00:38:56	Please, stay quiet.
560	00:38:56	00:38:58	Excuse me for a minute.
561	00:38:58	00:39:03	You know, I guess this could explain why Becky's skull was lacerated and not fractured.
562	00:39:03	00:39:05	She wasn't strong enough.
563	00:39:05	00:39:06	I had to protect him.
564	00:39:06	00:39:08	Protect who, Susan? Susan!
565	00:39:08	00:39:09	Protect your father?
566	00:39:09	00:39:11	Protect your father from what?
567	00:39:11	00:39:12	She was gonna leave him.
568	00:39:12	00:39:16	So that's why you killed your stepmother, to protect your father.
569	00:39:16	00:39:21	Last week, I skipped soccer practice and came home early.
570	00:39:24	00:39:26	You are so damn brilliant.
571	00:39:28	00:39:31	I just found the digital video and printed out the stills.
572	00:39:31	00:39:33	Dental Records.
573	00:39:33	00:39:35	I married a moron.
574	00:39:40	00:39:41	Did you check the P.O. box today?
575	00:39:41	00:39:44	Empty, but he's got another week.
576	00:39:45	00:39:47	Ray's whipped.
577	00:39:47	00:39:48	He brought up counseling again.
578	00:39:48	00:39:52	The idiot would die before letting me in on his freak-ass fetish.
579	00:39:57	00:39:59	My dad only married Becky because of me.
580	00:39:59	00:40:01	Explain that to me.
581	00:40:01	00:40:04	Well, he thought I needed a mom and that's why he stayed with her.
582	00:40:04	00:40:07	Blaming herself for the marriage.
583	00:40:07	00:40:10	She doesn't seem to blame herself for ending it.
584	00:40:10	00:40:18	So you waited for your granddad to go to sleep and you snuck out of the house, snuck back into your house, then you called your stepmom from your dad's telephone line.
585	00:40:19	00:40:20	Pretty tricky.
586	00:40:20	00:40:24	And then, you must've...
587	00:40:24	00:40:26	hid somewhere.
588	00:40:27	00:40:30	I hid in the closet.
589	00:40:30	00:40:33	I told her we had to talk and that I knew about her boyfriend.
590	00:40:33	00:40:34	Uh, hey, Dad.
591	00:40:34	00:40:36	Is Becky there?
592	00:40:36	00:40:37	Could I talk to her?
593	00:40:37	00:40:38	All right.
594	00:40:38	00:40:40	It's Susan.
595	00:40:41	00:40:42	Hey, babe.
596	00:40:42	00:40:45	Just tell Dad you'll take the call inside and meet me in my room.
597	00:40:45	00:40:47	Okay.
598	00:40:47	00:40:50	It's boy trouble.
599	00:40:50	00:40:51	I'll take this inside.
600	00:41:07	00:41:08	Are we done here?
601	00:41:08	00:41:10	Almost. We're almost done.
602	00:41:10	00:41:13	You know, Susan, there was a bloody paper towel left in the trash.
603	00:41:13	00:41:15	Can you tell me about that?
604	00:41:22	00:41:25	I put the phone back in my dad's office and I walked back to Grandpa's.
605	00:41:25	00:41:27	Where was your father when you killed your stepmother?
606	00:41:28	00:41:31	He was outside.
607	00:41:31	00:41:33	Asleep.
608	00:41:35	00:41:38	Did you catch that?
609	00:41:38	00:41:40	Timeline is off.
610	00:41:40	00:41:44	Curious.
611	00:41:44	00:41:48	You want to talk to the dad and I'll call the DA?
612	00:41:48	00:41:49	Sure.
613	00:42:02	00:42:04	You knew.
614	00:42:05	00:42:06	What?
615	00:42:06	00:42:09	Your daughter killed your wife and you knew it.
616	00:42:09	00:42:12	I don't know what you're talking about.
617	00:42:12	00:42:16	Susan attacked Becky as soon as she went into the house.
618	00:42:16	00:42:19	But you admitted to having another drink.
619	00:42:19	00:42:20	You would've heard the attack.
620	00:42:20	00:42:23	I'm sorry, but that's what happ...
621	00:42:23	00:42:28	You went into the house and found Susan wiping blood off of her hands.
622	00:42:28	00:42:31	You sent her back to her grandfather's.
623	00:42:31	00:42:36	You came up with a story to tell the cops, and then called 911.
624	00:42:38	00:42:41	You were protecting your daughter.
625	00:42:41	00:42:43	And now she's protecting you.
626	00:42:46	00:42:47	You can't prove it.
627	00:42:51	00:42:55	Well, either way, you have to live with it.
