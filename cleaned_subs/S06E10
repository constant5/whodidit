1,00:00:38,00:00:39,Jesse?
2,00:00:41,00:00:43,Jesse?
3,00:00:44,00:00:46,"Jesse... Jesse, can you hear me?"
4,00:00:49,00:00:51,"Jesse, please!"
5,00:00:52,00:00:53,Jesse!!
6,00:00:53,00:00:56,"Jesse Matthews, six years old."
7,00:00:56,00:00:57,GRISSOM: Is this an old photo?
8,00:00:57,00:00:58,"Yeah, it's the only one the mom had."
9,00:00:59,00:01:02,"She said one minute, he's on the swing, the next minute he's gone. Abduction."
10,00:01:03,00:01:05,The search radius is over a mile-- no sign of the boy.
11,00:01:05,00:01:06,What about the father?
12,00:01:07,00:01:08,"The father is, um..."
13,00:01:08,00:01:11,"Army sergeant, uh... Dwight Matthews."
14,00:01:11,00:01:13,Killed in Afghanistan four years ago.
15,00:01:13,00:01:16,Any other family members? Grandparents? Boyfriends?
16,00:01:16,00:01:21,"BRASS: No, her parents are dead and her husband's parents-- she lost communication with them since he died."
17,00:01:23,00:01:27,Mrs. Matthews... this is Gil Grissom and Warrick Brown from the Crime Lab.
18,00:01:28,00:01:31,"I, uh... I never bring Jesse to the park."
19,00:01:31,00:01:43,"But this afternoon, the backyard just couldn't hold him, so we came here and... uh... he was on the swings; I couldn't even get him off, and then I look around and he's gone; he's just..."
20,00:01:43,00:01:47,"Mrs. Matthews, there's really nothing more you can do here."
21,00:01:47,00:01:50,Why don't you let us give you a ride home?
22,00:01:50,00:01:53,I'm not leaving.
23,00:01:53,00:01:55,Not without Jesse.
24,00:02:01,00:02:03,I called the team.
25,00:02:05,00:02:06,They always look so vulnerable.
26,00:02:06,00:02:08,They are.
27,00:02:43,00:02:47,It's like trying to get an i.d. on swimmers from ripples in the pool. How about you?
28,00:02:47,00:02:52,Lots of little fingers... and some big ones.
29,00:02:52,00:02:54,Helping hands?
30,00:02:59,00:03:00,(camera shutter clicks)
31,00:03:13,00:03:14,(sets case down)
32,00:03:21,00:03:24,"So, ma'am, do you remember this boy?"
33,00:03:24,00:03:26,It's not a recent photo.
34,00:03:26,00:03:27,(sighs)
35,00:03:27,00:03:29,I had my hands full.
36,00:03:30,00:03:31,I don't take my eyes off him ever.
37,00:03:31,00:03:33,Sure. I understand.
38,00:03:33,00:03:38,But there was this man near the swings-- he kept looking around like he was waiting for something.
39,00:03:38,00:03:40,What'd he look like?
40,00:03:40,00:03:42,"He was a white guy, blue baseball cap..."
41,00:03:42,00:03:43,That's all I remember.
42,00:03:43,00:03:45,Did he seem interested in one of the kids?
43,00:03:45,00:03:47,Yeah. A boy.
44,00:03:47,00:03:49,Could be that boy.
45,00:03:51,00:03:52,Mm... it's hard to tell. Okay...
46,00:03:52,00:03:55,Thank you. Thank you very much.
47,00:03:58,00:04:00,Mrs. Matthews...
48,00:04:00,00:04:05,"I know this is difficult for you, but I have to ask you again-- do you remember seeing anyone hanging around near the swings?"
49,00:04:06,00:04:10,"Anyone. Maybe, maybe a man in a blue baseball cap?"
50,00:04:16,00:04:17,Yes.
51,00:04:17,00:04:19,Can you describe him?
52,00:04:19,00:04:20,He was white...
53,00:04:20,00:04:21,White...
54,00:04:21,00:04:24,"Uh... just under six feet, I think."
55,00:04:24,00:04:25,Six feet. Great.
56,00:04:25,00:04:26,Jeans.
57,00:04:30,00:04:32,Did he take Jesse?
58,00:04:32,00:04:34,We don't know.
59,00:04:59,00:05:04,Our K-9 officers are going to need something that Jesse's worn recently.
60,00:05:04,00:05:06,Uh... his jacket.
61,00:05:06,00:05:08,It's in the car. I'll get it for you.
62,00:05:12,00:05:14,(panting)
63,00:05:25,00:05:27,(panting)
64,00:05:42,00:05:44,Whoa! Whoa! What are they doing?
65,00:05:44,00:05:45,"Pull the dogs back, please."
66,00:05:48,00:05:49,Can I see this jacket?
67,00:05:55,00:05:57,Has Jesse ever worn this?
68,00:05:57,00:05:58,I just bought it for him.
69,00:05:58,00:06:00,"He's been growing so fast. I'm sorry, I..."
70,00:06:00,00:06:02,That's okay; we'll get something from your house.
71,00:06:27,00:06:28,(camera shutter clicking)
72,00:06:32,00:06:34,What do you make of this?
73,00:06:36,00:06:38,Possible struggle...
74,00:06:38,00:06:40,That could've been used as a weapon.
75,00:06:40,00:06:44,The blood drops could be castoff.
76,00:06:59,00:07:01,Maybe the poor kid had to pee while his mom was in the car.
77,00:07:11,00:07:14,"Mrs. Matthews, I need you to take a look at something."
78,00:07:14,00:07:15,Do you recognize these?
79,00:07:21,00:07:22,They're...
80,00:07:23,00:07:27,(retching)
81,00:07:30,00:07:32,(siren whoops)
82,00:07:37,00:07:39,WILLOWS: Mrs. Matthews inside?
83,00:07:39,00:07:41,BRASS: Yeah.
84,00:07:41,00:07:43,Every mother's worst nightmare.
85,00:07:45,00:07:47,I checked her answering machine: no calls.
86,00:07:47,00:07:51,"Well, I'll get a DNA exemplar for Jesse and let her get some sleep."
87,00:07:51,00:07:52,She won't sleep.
88,00:07:52,00:07:54,"Okay, Greg, let's do a little legwork, what do you say?"
89,00:07:54,00:07:59,"You take this side of the street, I'll take the other-- find out if anybody's seen anything suspicious."
90,00:08:26,00:08:28,Mrs. Matthews?
91,00:08:35,00:08:36,Mrs. Matthews?
92,00:08:38,00:08:41,I'm Catherine Willows from the Crime Lab.
93,00:08:41,00:08:43,Sorry about the mess.
94,00:08:43,00:08:44,It's okay.
95,00:08:44,00:08:47,Jesse was so full of energy this morning.
96,00:08:47,00:08:50,He didn't give me time to clean up.
97,00:08:50,00:08:52,I understand.
98,00:08:52,00:08:54,This photo...
99,00:08:54,00:08:57,Is it recent?
100,00:08:57,00:09:00,"Uh, yeah, that's, uh, that's from last month."
101,00:09:00,00:09:03,"If it's all right with you, I'd like to borrow it."
102,00:09:03,00:09:06,"I'll get it to Nevada Child Search, and they can get it out to the media."
103,00:09:06,00:09:07,Sure.
104,00:09:07,00:09:08,Thank you.
105,00:09:12,00:09:14,Jesse's home-schooled.
106,00:09:15,00:09:18,We do art together... music...
107,00:09:18,00:09:21,Everything.
108,00:09:24,00:09:26,Do you have children?
109,00:09:26,00:09:30,I have a daughter. Thirteen.
110,00:09:30,00:09:36,"WILLOWS: ""Thirty-six and a half inches."" We'll add it to the physical description."
111,00:09:36,00:09:40,"And, Mrs. Matthews, our K-9 Unit will need something with Jesse's scent."
112,00:09:41,00:09:41,"Oh, right, right."
113,00:09:42,00:09:44,Um... maybe... maybe his stuffed dinosaur?
114,00:09:44,00:09:46,He holds it while he's sleeping.
115,00:09:46,00:09:48,That'll work.
116,00:09:48,00:09:54,"And I will need something with his DNA: a toothbrush, hairbrush, pillowcase..."
117,00:09:54,00:09:55,Why do you need that?
118,00:09:55,00:10:00,"Well, if we locate anything that could lead us to him, we want to make sure we've got the right boy."
119,00:10:00,00:10:03,"Well, I'll get those things for you."
120,00:10:16,00:10:18,Hi.
121,00:10:18,00:10:20,Captain Brass asked me to drive the lady's car home.
122,00:10:20,00:10:21,Oh... okay.
123,00:10:21,00:10:22,"Yeah, I'll let her know."
124,00:10:22,00:10:24,Thanks. Mm-hmm.
125,00:10:48,00:10:51,"Since her husband died, Kids' toys always laying around."
126,00:10:51,00:10:58,"I'm always tossing balls over my fence back into her yard They keep to themselves, which is fine by me."
127,00:10:58,00:11:02,"Sir, have you seen any suspicious cars in the neighborhood, or strangers?"
128,00:11:02,00:11:06,"I work all day and I don't spend my nights looking at the neighbors, okay?"
129,00:11:06,00:11:08,"Well, what about the weekends?"
130,00:11:08,00:11:10,(dog snarling)
131,00:11:10,00:11:12,Aggressive little pooch.
132,00:11:12,00:11:14,"Oh, she's my sweetie."
133,00:11:14,00:11:15,Who's my good girl?
134,00:11:16,00:11:17,Queenie's my good girl.
135,00:11:17,00:11:20,"Yes, you are. Yes, you are."
136,00:11:21,00:11:22,Interesting how things work out.
137,00:11:22,00:11:24,What do you mean?
138,00:11:24,00:11:26,Her kid getting killed.
139,00:11:26,00:11:27,This is Queenie.
140,00:11:27,00:11:31,"My last dog, Princess..."
141,00:11:31,00:11:34,"Princess died, and she did it."
142,00:11:34,00:11:36,Karen Matthews?
143,00:11:36,00:11:38,Four years ago.
144,00:11:38,00:11:41,I found Princess hanging off the back fence.
145,00:11:41,00:11:45,"Supposed to look like it was an accident, like she got caught on collar and choked."
146,00:11:45,00:11:47,Did you see her do that?
147,00:11:47,00:11:51,"No, but I knew."
148,00:11:51,00:11:54,"See, Princess used to bark through the fence at her kid."
149,00:11:54,00:11:56,She just wanted to play.
150,00:11:56,00:11:59,"If you ask me, you know what?"
151,00:11:59,00:12:03,"the kid liked it, but Karen she just went off the deep end."
152,00:12:03,00:12:07,"Mr. McCracken, who told you her son was killed?"
153,00:12:33,00:12:34,Who takes care of the hamsters?
154,00:12:34,00:12:37,Jesse. When he remembers.
155,00:12:37,00:12:41,which is about as often as he remembers to brush his teeth.
156,00:12:44,00:12:47,"Mrs. Matthews, has Jesse ever run away from home?"
157,00:12:47,00:12:49,He'd never do that.
158,00:12:50,00:12:53,Was he upset about anything?
159,00:12:53,00:12:56,No. No. No.
160,00:12:56,00:12:57,You're going to find him.
161,00:12:58,00:13:01,"If something happened, I'd know."
162,00:13:04,00:13:06,I'd know here.
163,00:13:06,00:13:08,Of course. I'd feel the same.
164,00:13:10,00:13:19,"Mrs. Matthews, when the officer brought your car back, I noticed that there were gifts in the garage that were from your husband's parents."
165,00:13:19,00:13:24,"The, um... the colonel and his wife."
166,00:13:24,00:13:26,"We're, uh, we're not in touch anymore."
167,00:13:26,00:13:31,Ever since Dwight was...
168,00:13:31,00:13:35,"Ever since Dwight died, my father-in-law thinks he should be raising Jesse, not me."
169,00:13:35,00:13:38,He runs that house like an Army barracks.
170,00:13:38,00:13:41,Do you know what that does to a boy?
171,00:13:41,00:13:46,"Well, I saw what it did to Dwight, and I will notlet him do that to Jesse."
172,00:13:46,00:13:49,I'm still going to need some contact information.
173,00:13:52,00:13:53,They took him.
174,00:14:44,00:14:50,"We haven't seen Karen or Jesse since, um... uh..."
175,00:14:51,00:14:53,since...
176,00:14:53,00:14:57,"We haven't seen them in four years, since the day we buried our son."
177,00:15:01,00:15:04,Here. Here's your toy soldier.
178,00:15:10,00:15:11,"Warren, not today."
179,00:15:11,00:15:12,He's my grandson.
180,00:15:12,00:15:14,"It-it's, it's a toy."
181,00:15:14,00:15:17,I will raise my own son-- not you.
182,00:15:21,00:15:29,"Jesse comes from a, from a long line of military men going all the way back to Bull Run."
183,00:15:29,00:15:30,Were you in the service?
184,00:15:30,00:15:33,"Yes, sir. Marine Corps."
185,00:15:33,00:15:34,"I bet your dad was, too, right?"
186,00:15:34,00:15:36,"You know, we're here to talk about your family, not mine."
187,00:15:37,00:15:43,"If we hadn't seen Jesse's picture last night on TV, we wouldn't know what he looked like now."
188,00:15:44,00:15:45,She blames me.
189,00:15:45,00:15:49,"I do not. Don't tell me what I know and don't know, all right?"
190,00:15:49,00:15:50,Can I please just go to the bathroom?
191,00:15:50,00:15:52,"Oh, absolutely. Absolutely."
192,00:15:52,00:15:53,Where is it?
193,00:15:53,00:15:58,"It's. uh... down the hall to the right, through the door."
194,00:15:58,00:15:59,Excuse me.
195,00:16:03,00:16:08,This is just between you and me.
196,00:16:08,00:16:09,I saw Karen last week.
197,00:16:13,00:16:16,"Oh, hi, Karen, uh, could I see Jesse please? No."
198,00:16:17,00:16:19,"Karen, he's my only grandson."
199,00:16:19,00:16:21,"You can't have him, okay?"
200,00:16:21,00:16:22,"I don't want to keep him, Karen."
201,00:16:22,00:16:23,I just want to give him these. Please.
202,00:16:23,00:16:24,Just leave us alone.
203,00:16:25,00:16:26,"Jesse! It's Grandpa. Jesse! No, please."
204,00:16:28,00:16:30,Colonel?
205,00:16:34,00:16:36,Where's my wife?
206,00:16:36,00:16:39,She's in the ladies' room. It's okay.
207,00:16:39,00:16:44,Do you get these uh... these spells often?
208,00:16:44,00:16:46,There's some memory loss?
209,00:16:50,00:16:51,It's early Alzheimer's.
210,00:16:51,00:16:54,That's a tough one.
211,00:16:54,00:16:58,All I wanted was to see my grandson.
212,00:17:01,00:17:03,Find him for me.
213,00:17:03,00:17:05,"We'll do our best, sir."
214,00:17:05,00:17:07,We'll do our very best.
215,00:17:09,00:17:11,BROWN: Any luck with those prints from the swing?
216,00:17:11,00:17:15,"Nothing on AFIS, but Brass did put out a bulletin for the guy in the blue baseball cap."
217,00:17:15,00:17:18,I wouldn't get our hopes up-- it's a vague description.
218,00:17:18,00:17:19,What about the K-9 search?
219,00:17:19,00:17:20,Nothing.
220,00:17:22,00:17:23,What do you got for me?
221,00:17:23,00:17:27,"Well, I ran the exemplar toothbrush against a blood sample from the men's room."
222,00:17:28,00:17:29,It's not a match.
223,00:17:29,00:17:30,What about the underpants?
224,00:17:30,00:17:34,Couldn't get enough epithelials for DNA 'cause the kid probably hadn't been wearing them for very long.
225,00:17:34,00:17:36,I wonder why.
226,00:17:36,00:17:39,"Well, I did confirm a positive result for urea in the underpants."
227,00:17:40,00:17:44,and the quantity and distribution suggests that the kid wet himself.
228,00:17:44,00:17:47,Ditched his wet tighty-whiteys and went back out to play.
229,00:17:48,00:17:50,(beeping)
230,00:17:50,00:17:52,I got a hit on your blood. Conner Daly.
231,00:17:52,00:17:54,Convicted of NRS 201.450.
232,00:17:54,00:17:55,Out on parole.
233,00:17:55,00:17:57,What's a 450?
234,00:17:57,00:18:08,"That'd be ""Sex With Dead Body."" Mr. Daly, where were you yesterday afternoon?"
235,00:18:08,00:18:11,Playing nickel slots downtown.
236,00:18:11,00:18:16,"I, uh.... I'm not trying to win the big jackpot or anything just passing time."
237,00:18:17,00:18:21,It relaxes me.
238,00:18:21,00:18:24,Where did you go next?
239,00:18:24,00:18:25,Walked in the park.
240,00:18:26,00:18:27,Fresh air.
241,00:18:27,00:18:30,I'm allergic to smoke.
242,00:18:30,00:18:31,Which park?
243,00:18:31,00:18:33,One near my apartment.
244,00:18:33,00:18:37,Would that be Mesa Valley Park?
245,00:18:37,00:18:38,Yeah.
246,00:18:38,00:18:44,Then I sat down on a park bench and read a copy of theRJ that I picked out of the trash.
247,00:18:44,00:18:45,What's this about?
248,00:18:45,00:18:47,Did you go to the men's room at any time?
249,00:18:47,00:18:49,Only when nature called.
250,00:18:49,00:18:51,What did you do there?
251,00:18:52,00:18:54,I amused myself.
252,00:18:54,00:18:56,What did you do next?
253,00:18:56,00:18:58,We found your blood on the floor.
254,00:18:58,00:19:02,I get nosebleeds.
255,00:19:02,00:19:04,Too much cocaine back in the day.
256,00:19:04,00:19:07,I'm sure we'll find that on your medical records.
257,00:19:09,00:19:13,(seething)
258,00:19:13,00:19:16,My whole damn life is on record.
259,00:19:17,00:19:19,"So, why don't you look at the freakin' records, huh?"
260,00:19:19,00:19:21,"You have anger issues, Mr. Daly?"
261,00:19:23,00:19:25,Yeah.
262,00:19:25,00:19:29,"Would you take a seat for me, please."
263,00:19:37,00:19:40,What's that cut on your hand from?
264,00:19:40,00:19:41,Pick the wrong partner?
265,00:19:41,00:19:43,No.
266,00:19:51,00:19:54,"Look, I'll send the county a buck 50."
267,00:19:54,00:19:56,They can buy a new one.
268,00:20:00,00:20:02,You recognize this boy?
269,00:20:05,00:20:09,Looks like a kid that this guy brought into the bathroom but I didn't stay to watch.
270,00:20:09,00:20:11,Did you get a look at the guy?
271,00:20:13,00:20:15,51s fan.
272,00:20:16,00:20:18,His cap.
273,00:20:18,00:20:22,Las Vegas police may have a break in the case of a missing boy.
274,00:20:22,00:20:32,An eyewitness has come forward with a more complete description of the suspect Authorities are now seekingthisman in connection with the disappearance yesterday of six-year-old Jesse Matthews.
275,00:20:32,00:20:41,"Initial reports from the scene only mention a man in a blue cap, but the police artist had a lot more to work with after the eyewitness came forward."
276,00:20:41,00:20:45,"Uh, uh... I'm ju... I'm just trying to stay positive."
277,00:20:45,00:20:49,"and, um, you know, I know that Jesse'll be safe at home again soon. So."
278,00:20:51,00:20:52,I know he'll be safe.
279,00:20:52,00:20:56,"The boy's mother, Karen, is holding out hope that she'll see her son again."
280,00:20:56,00:20:58,She's seen tragedy enough.
281,00:20:58,00:21:03,"Four years ago, she lost her husband in combat in Afghanistan."
282,00:21:15,00:21:16,Sorry. Declined again.
283,00:21:16,00:21:18,You have another card?
284,00:21:18,00:21:19,"Aw, come on."
285,00:21:19,00:21:20,That's the fourth time.
286,00:21:20,00:21:22,Maybe we got identity theft-ed or something.
287,00:21:22,00:21:24,"Hey, hey, leave that candy alone."
288,00:21:24,00:21:25,It could be the card-reader.
289,00:21:25,00:21:26,My manager be right back.
290,00:21:26,00:21:29,If you guys want to get some coffee it's on the house.
291,00:21:29,00:21:30,Las Vegas Police.
292,00:21:30,00:21:32,You're under arrest. What?
293,00:21:32,00:21:33,"That's the kid from the news, right?"
294,00:21:33,00:21:34,Yeah. You did good.
295,00:21:34,00:21:35,"Yeah, what the hell is going on here?"
296,00:21:35,00:21:37,"Hey, let go of me. What are you arresting us for? Huh?"
297,00:21:37,00:21:39,What's going on? What are you arresting us for?!
298,00:21:39,00:21:40,Get away from him.
299,00:21:40,00:21:41,Get away from him!
300,00:21:41,00:21:42,"It's all right, son."
301,00:21:42,00:21:43,You're safe now..
302,00:21:45,00:21:47,"God, where is he?"
303,00:21:47,00:21:49,He's in with a social worker. He's okay.
304,00:21:49,00:21:50,Jesse!
305,00:21:51,00:21:52,"Oh, Jesse, thank God."
306,00:21:52,00:21:55,Thank God you're okay.
307,00:21:55,00:21:56,"No, no, no, it's okay."
308,00:21:56,00:21:58,Mommy is here. You're safe now.
309,00:21:58,00:21:58,Mommy!
310,00:21:58,00:22:00,Mommy! Mommy! Adam! Adam!
311,00:22:00,00:22:02,"KAREN: No, your mommy's here, honey."
312,00:22:02,00:22:04,WOMAN: Get away from my kid!
313,00:22:04,00:22:05,What did they say to you?
314,00:22:05,00:22:06,"What did they make you say, sweetheart?"
315,00:22:06,00:22:08,Look at me. Don't say nothing to nobody.
316,00:22:08,00:22:10,"You hear me, little man, huh?"
317,00:22:10,00:22:12,KAREN: Don't look at those people.
318,00:22:12,00:22:13,Just look at me. Just look right here.
319,00:22:13,00:22:15,Jim?
320,00:22:15,00:22:16,What the hell's going on?
321,00:22:16,00:22:17,That's Victor and Valerie Esposito.
322,00:22:17,00:22:20,Transplants from Jersey.
323,00:22:20,00:22:21,Check this out.
324,00:22:22,00:22:26,It was with Mrs. Esposito's personal belongings at booking.
325,00:22:26,00:22:31,WILLOWS: He's got the same scar over his eye as in Karen's photo.
326,00:22:31,00:22:33,So this kid has two moms?
327,00:22:33,00:22:35,King Solomon threatened to cut the baby in half.
328,00:22:35,00:22:36,What are you going to do?
329,00:22:36,00:22:38,King Solomon didn't have a DNA lab.
330,00:22:42,00:22:49,"Hey, is it all right if he goes with CSI Brown for a little while?"
331,00:22:49,00:22:50,It won't be long.
332,00:22:52,00:22:54,Okay.
333,00:22:54,00:22:55,My name's Warrick.
334,00:22:55,00:22:56,You want to go for a walk?
335,00:22:59,00:23:00,"It's okay, sweetheart."
336,00:23:00,00:23:01,He's a friend.
337,00:23:03,00:23:05,"Come on, we'll have some fun."
338,00:23:05,00:23:06,"Oh, wait."
339,00:23:06,00:23:08,He gets cold.
340,00:23:11,00:23:13,Thank you.
341,00:23:27,00:23:30,"Wow, everybody's so busy in there, huh?"
342,00:23:30,00:23:33,I hear you like dinosaurs.
343,00:23:33,00:23:36,Which one's your favorite?
344,00:23:38,00:23:41,You know what mine is? T-Rex.
345,00:23:41,00:23:45,'Cause he's got teeth like this big.
346,00:23:45,00:23:49,"I bet you wouldn't want him for a pet, would you?"
347,00:23:51,00:23:53,You want to see something cool?
348,00:23:53,00:23:55,Come over here.
349,00:24:01,00:24:04,This is my special science kit.
350,00:24:04,00:24:07,Got all kinds of stuff in here.
351,00:24:07,00:24:09,Let me see... I got rubber gloves.
352,00:24:11,00:24:13,Yeah...
353,00:24:13,00:24:14,Put that on.
354,00:24:14,00:24:16,What else I got in here?
355,00:24:16,00:24:18,I got pens that turn into flashlights.
356,00:24:21,00:24:24,You want to see something invisible?
357,00:24:24,00:24:26,Go like this.
358,00:24:31,00:24:32,"See, there's nothing there, right?"
359,00:24:32,00:24:40,"But take my magic wand right here, and I put it in my special magic powder like this."
360,00:24:40,00:24:43,Watch this.
361,00:24:43,00:24:46,What appears is our fingerprints.
362,00:24:47,00:24:50,Now shine the flashlight on it.
363,00:24:51,00:24:53,Good job.
364,00:24:53,00:24:55,Will you be my assistant?
365,00:24:58,00:25:02,"See, no two people's fingerprints are alike."
366,00:25:02,00:25:05,Just like no two people's spit is the same.
367,00:25:05,00:25:10,So if I took my spit like this...
368,00:25:12,00:25:14,Now you do it.
369,00:25:18,00:25:27,"See, even if I mix them up, I have a machine to tell me which one is mine and which one is yours."
370,00:25:27,00:25:29,"Now, I need you to tell me something."
371,00:25:29,00:25:36,Which one of these two pretty ladies is your mom?
372,00:25:36,00:25:38,That one.
373,00:25:42,00:25:43,Thank you.
374,00:25:43,00:25:45,"Yeah, whatever."
375,00:25:45,00:25:46,Can I see Adam now?
376,00:25:46,00:25:49,Adam? Yeah.
377,00:25:49,00:25:50,My kid.
378,00:25:50,00:25:54,"Well, once our lab confirms DNA, he can go home with his mother."
379,00:25:54,00:25:56,Who the hell do you think I am?
380,00:25:58,00:26:00,Mrs. Esposito...
381,00:26:02,00:26:04,did you adopt Adam?
382,00:26:04,00:26:06,Give me a break.
383,00:26:06,00:26:08,26 hours in labor. Finally had a C-section.
384,00:26:18,00:26:19,Did you have twins?
385,00:26:28,00:26:30,Can I take Jesse home now?
386,00:26:30,00:26:33,I need your help to tie up a few loose ends.
387,00:26:33,00:26:36,"Of course, anything."
388,00:26:36,00:26:37,Let's start with a sample of your DNA.
389,00:26:37,00:26:41,What? We have to follow procedure for everyone's protection.
390,00:26:41,00:26:45,"In fact, Jesse can't even be released without a positive match."
391,00:26:45,00:26:48,He doesn't stay up this late.
392,00:26:48,00:26:49,"I'll make it a rush, I promise."
393,00:26:54,00:26:56,"Open your mouth, please."
394,00:26:59,00:27:02,WILLOWS: It's the same kid.
395,00:27:02,00:27:04,"It's a doppelganger, with an identical scar."
396,00:27:04,00:27:06,He picked Mrs. Esposito.
397,00:27:06,00:27:14,"WILLOWS: I know there's cases in which the kidnappers threatened their victims, ""Tell them that I'm your mother or I'll kill your real mom."" I don't think he's lying."
398,00:27:14,00:27:16,I don't think that Mrs. Esposito's lying either.
399,00:27:16,00:27:20,Karen Matthews had a house full of photos of him.
400,00:27:20,00:27:22,"Well, I'm sure the Espositos do, too."
401,00:27:25,00:27:30,There's something off about this picture.
402,00:27:30,00:27:31,"It seems kind of set up, doesn't it?"
403,00:27:36,00:27:38,The pixel density's not the same.
404,00:27:42,00:27:44,Where'd she get this picture of Adam?
405,00:27:44,00:27:46,How'd she get it?
406,00:27:46,00:27:47,Maybe she's a stalker.
407,00:27:47,00:27:48,"No, she wouldn't have stalked us to Cape May."
408,00:27:49,00:27:49,This isn't it.
409,00:27:50,00:27:52,It's the only shore we've been to.
410,00:27:52,00:27:53,Do you recognize anything in the picture?
411,00:27:53,00:27:59,"Yeah, that's the shirt his Nana gave him last summer. He only wore it that once, at our family reunion."
412,00:27:59,00:28:02,Was Karen Matthews there?
413,00:28:02,00:28:04,No way.
414,00:28:04,00:28:05,Mr. Esposito...
415,00:28:06,00:28:14,several witnesses saw a man matching your description at Mesa Valley Park when Jesse disappeared.
416,00:28:14,00:28:16,"Yeah, I'm there all the time."
417,00:28:16,00:28:17,We live around the corner.
418,00:28:17,00:28:19,We just had Adam's birthday party there last month.
419,00:28:19,00:28:20,Yeah.
420,00:28:21,00:28:23,Were you there the day before yesterday?
421,00:28:23,00:28:25,"Yeah, with Adam. Yeah."
422,00:28:25,00:28:27,You told me you were taking him for ice cream.
423,00:28:27,00:28:29,What were you doing in the park?
424,00:28:29,00:28:30,I had to meet a guy.
425,00:28:30,00:28:33,A guy?
426,00:28:33,00:28:34,"Oh, my God."
427,00:28:34,00:28:35,You're putting money down on a game?
428,00:28:35,00:28:39,"You promised you quit. I did, all right? It's for a guy at work."
429,00:28:40,00:28:42,(car horn honking)
430,00:28:43,00:28:44,"Three-to-one, right?"
431,00:28:47,00:28:49,Adam.
432,00:28:50,00:28:52,"Well, you should have just took him for ice cream."
433,00:28:55,00:29:00,So Karen took a picture of herself at the beach and Photoshopped Jesse in.
434,00:29:00,00:29:01,Right.
435,00:29:01,00:29:06,"So if that's really Adam Esposito, where did she get the pictures from?"
436,00:29:06,00:29:08,"Well, let us see."
437,00:29:09,00:29:11,Where are you going?
438,00:29:11,00:29:14,Image search.
439,00:29:14,00:29:16,Family home page.
440,00:29:16,00:29:19,My mom wants me to do one of these for our family.
441,00:29:20,00:29:26,"Click on where it says ""Adam's Birthday Party."" That one."
442,00:29:26,00:29:29,Maybe Karen found the site.
443,00:29:29,00:29:31,Cut out the kid's picture.
444,00:29:31,00:29:34,That's Mesa Valley Park.
445,00:29:34,00:29:38,Karen Matthews faked those photos that she gave Catherine.
446,00:29:38,00:29:39,How?
447,00:29:39,00:29:41,Cut-and-paste.
448,00:29:42,00:29:43,The photos that she got off the Internet.
449,00:29:43,00:29:49,The Espositos told Catherine that they were at the park with their son the day Jesse Matthews disappeared.
450,00:29:49,00:29:50,Is that a coincidence?
451,00:29:50,00:29:55,No. My guess is Karen's been downloading pictures from the family Web site for a while.
452,00:29:55,00:29:57,The most recent being from Mesa Valley Park.
453,00:29:57,00:30:01,Could Karen have recognized the park from the pictures on the Web site?
454,00:30:01,00:30:04,"Yeah, and she went there hoping to see him there."
455,00:30:04,00:30:05,But she reported him missing.
456,00:30:05,00:30:07,That makes no sense.
457,00:30:07,00:30:08,"Hey, I got the DNA results."
458,00:30:08,00:30:10,The boy is Adam Esposito.
459,00:30:10,00:30:13,Victor and Valerie are his parents.
460,00:30:13,00:30:14,"There you go, she's lying."
461,00:30:14,00:30:15,She doesn't have a son.
462,00:30:15,00:30:16,"Uh, not quite."
463,00:30:16,00:30:20,She's got 13 alleles in common with the male DNA that we got from the toothbrush exemplar.
464,00:30:20,00:30:22,So she does have a son.
465,00:30:22,00:30:23,WILLOWS: I was inside the house.
466,00:30:23,00:30:26,"Believe me, a kid does live there."
467,00:30:28,00:30:30,And we're still looking for Jesse Matthews.
468,00:30:43,00:30:44,Karen Matthews.
469,00:30:47,00:30:50,Can I take Jesse home now?
470,00:30:50,00:30:51,I'm afraid not. No.
471,00:30:52,00:30:54,The DNA confirms the boy's not your child.
472,00:30:54,00:30:57,I... That's impossible.
473,00:30:57,00:31:03,Your actions regarding the Espositos constitutes stalking and possible kidnapping.
474,00:31:03,00:31:05,Please go with this officer.
475,00:31:05,00:31:07,"No, no... What have you done with Jesse?"
476,00:31:07,00:31:09,Ma'am...
477,00:31:09,00:31:10,Where is he? OFFICER: Ma'am...
478,00:31:10,00:31:11,"Jesse? Please, ma'am..."
479,00:31:11,00:31:13,"Jesse? Jesse, where are you?!"
480,00:31:13,00:31:14,"Ma'am, please..."
481,00:31:14,00:31:15,I need to see my son!
482,00:31:15,00:31:16,Jesse!
483,00:31:16,00:31:18,"Jesse, where are you?!"
484,00:31:18,00:31:20,Please! Please! Jesse!
485,00:31:21,00:31:23,Jesse!
486,00:31:23,00:31:24,"Jesse, where are you?!"
487,00:31:24,00:31:26,"""Jesse David Matthews."
488,00:31:26,00:31:28,"""Mother Karen, father Dwight."
489,00:31:28,00:31:34,"""Born August 31, 1999."" I also checked for a death certificate."
490,00:31:34,00:31:35,Nothing on file.
491,00:31:35,00:31:37,These are all in chronological order.
492,00:31:37,00:31:42,Archie confirmed that all the photos taken along the top row were genuine.
493,00:31:42,00:31:46,Up until the photo taken at the funeral in which he was two.
494,00:31:46,00:31:49,"So, the rest of these were faked using Adam Esposito?"
495,00:31:49,00:31:50,Yeah.
496,00:31:50,00:31:51,You talked to the neighbors.
497,00:31:51,00:31:53,What did they say?
498,00:31:53,00:31:55,Jesse and Karen kept to themselves.
499,00:31:55,00:32:00,But he was always leaving his toys around outside. They saw his toys-- did they see him?
500,00:32:00,00:32:05,"Well, when I asked, ""When was the last time you saw Jesse?"" no one remembered exactly."
501,00:32:05,00:32:06,What about his grandparents?
502,00:32:06,00:32:08,They haven't seen him since the funeral.
503,00:32:08,00:32:11,Has anyone seen Jesse since he was two?
504,00:32:11,00:32:14,"His teachers or a doctor, baby-sitters...?"
505,00:32:14,00:32:16,"Well, he was home-schooled."
506,00:32:16,00:32:19,And we're looking into a doctor and a sitter.
507,00:32:19,00:32:26,"Well, I guess we can impound her car and find out if there's any evidence that he was even in there."
508,00:32:26,00:32:35,For four years she's created an elaborate fantasy-- which collided with reality at Mesa Valley Park.
509,00:32:41,00:32:43,Jesse.
510,00:32:46,00:32:47,Jesse?
511,00:32:47,00:32:49,Where are you?!
512,00:32:49,00:32:50,Jesse?!
513,00:32:50,00:32:54,I suppose she thought it was her son that was gone when she looked back at that empty swing.
514,00:32:54,00:32:58,"WILLOWS: When she couldn't find him, she called the police."
515,00:32:58,00:33:01,Jesse's been missing for four years.
516,00:33:01,00:33:04,We're chasing a ghost.
517,00:33:04,00:33:06,We went to the park.
518,00:33:06,00:33:09,I-I brought Jesse's new jacket.
519,00:33:09,00:33:15,"He was on the swings and when I wasn't looking, a man in a blue cap took him."
520,00:33:15,00:33:19,"Karen, tell me what happened four years ago after your husband was killed."
521,00:33:22,00:33:24,I-I... that's a...
522,00:33:24,00:33:27,I am not the one that should be here.
523,00:33:27,00:33:30,You should be talking to the man that took Jesse.
524,00:33:30,00:33:31,Did Jesse get sick?
525,00:33:31,00:33:33,Was there an accident?
526,00:33:36,00:33:38,Karen?
527,00:33:38,00:33:42,Did something happen to Jesse?
528,00:33:44,00:33:46,Is Jesse dead?
529,00:33:46,00:33:50,You saw him.
530,00:33:50,00:33:55,You were... you were there while I held him in my arms.
531,00:33:55,00:33:56,Why are you putting me through this?
532,00:33:58,00:34:00,Tell me. Why?
533,00:34:03,00:34:05,So how do we do this?
534,00:34:05,00:34:07,Old school.
535,00:34:07,00:34:09,Soil probes.
536,00:34:09,00:34:13,The probe goes deeper where the soil's been disturbed.
537,00:34:16,00:34:18,SANDERS: And that's where we dig?
538,00:34:18,00:34:20,"On the one hand, you really want to find the body."
539,00:34:21,00:34:25,"Give it respect, provide closure..."
540,00:34:25,00:34:27,On the other hand...
541,00:34:27,00:34:30,Yeah.
542,00:34:37,00:34:42,She would have buried the body where he would have still been close to her.
543,00:34:42,00:34:45,"You know, I'm not finding any density changes."
544,00:34:45,00:34:47,SANDERS: Me neither.
545,00:34:55,00:34:58,Somebody replaced this fence board right here.
546,00:34:58,00:35:02,These other ones look like they've been chewed on.
547,00:35:03,00:35:07,Guy said that Karen freaked out when his dog barked at her kid.
548,00:35:07,00:35:10,Maybe the dog chewed through the fence.
549,00:35:12,00:35:14,There's definitely a change in density there.
550,00:35:14,00:35:15,Let's start digging.
551,00:35:34,00:35:37,I found this in Karen's medicine chest.
552,00:35:37,00:35:39,Olanzapine.
553,00:35:39,00:35:41,That's a heavy-duty antipsychotic.
554,00:35:41,00:35:42,Yeah.
555,00:35:42,00:35:45,But the prescription is over four years old.
556,00:35:45,00:35:46,I'll have Brass subpoena her medical records.
557,00:35:47,00:35:54,"You know, if she was being treated for psychosis, it could explain all of this, because she didn't overlook a single detail."
558,00:35:54,00:35:56,I think she even did the fingerpaintings.
559,00:35:56,00:35:58,It's hard for anyone to let go of someone they love.
560,00:35:58,00:36:00,Yeah.
561,00:36:00,00:36:04,"After my dad died, my mom would still get him a present every Christmas."
562,00:36:04,00:36:06,She'd put it under the tree.
563,00:36:06,00:36:11,"Christmas morning, the wrapping paper would be all crumpled up and, uh..."
564,00:36:11,00:36:16,"the tie or the sweater, whatever it was, would be hanging in the closet."
565,00:36:16,00:36:17,How old were you when he died?
566,00:36:18,00:36:21,Nine.
567,00:36:21,00:36:24,Little guy.
568,00:36:24,00:36:28,I'll get started in Karen's room.
569,00:36:28,00:36:30,He taught botany.
570,00:36:30,00:36:32,"He, uh..."
571,00:36:33,00:36:38,"came home from school one hot, humid day, laid down on the couch."
572,00:36:38,00:36:39,I was watching TV.
573,00:36:41,00:36:44,My Mom brought in some cold drinks...
574,00:36:44,00:36:48,but she couldn't wake him up.
575,00:36:52,00:36:53,No one would tell me why.
576,00:37:32,00:37:35,"(over P.A.): Nick Stokes, you have a visitor in Reception."
577,00:37:36,00:37:38,"Nick Stokes, you have a visitor in Reception."
578,00:37:38,00:37:40,"Hey, Hodges."
579,00:37:40,00:37:42,"Oh, hey, Nick."
580,00:37:42,00:37:43,Did you hear you had a visitor?
581,00:37:43,00:37:46,"Yeah, and you have a tissue sample with adherent hairs."
582,00:37:46,00:37:48,Examine the hairs and get the tissue sample to DNA.
583,00:37:48,00:37:49,Priority.
584,00:37:49,00:37:51,I'll just drop everything I'm doing.
585,00:37:51,00:37:52,"Priority, Nick Stokes."
586,00:37:52,00:37:53,"You're coming around, Hodges."
587,00:37:57,00:37:59,"Hey. I, uh, I have a visitor?"
588,00:38:06,00:38:07,Kelly?
589,00:38:07,00:38:09,Hi. Hi.
590,00:38:09,00:38:12,You... you got out.
591,00:38:12,00:38:15,Couple days ago.
592,00:38:15,00:38:17,Mm...
593,00:38:17,00:38:21,Parole hearing board liked my smile.
594,00:38:27,00:38:31,"You know, I thought I saw you at a crime scene the other day."
595,00:38:31,00:38:32,You did.
596,00:38:32,00:38:33,I did?
597,00:38:34,00:38:36,Just checking it out.
598,00:38:38,00:38:46,"You know how, when you came to see me, what you said about when I get out, not taking it with me?"
599,00:38:48,00:38:50,I've been thinking a lot about that.
600,00:38:52,00:38:55,I wanted you to know.
601,00:38:56,00:38:58,You all right?
602,00:38:58,00:39:00,Perfect.
603,00:39:23,00:39:26,(dog barking)
604,00:39:35,00:39:38,That would be Queenie.
605,00:39:38,00:39:39,(barking continues)
606,00:39:39,00:39:43,"Even after four years, you'd expect to find some bones."
607,00:39:43,00:39:45,There's nothing.
608,00:39:52,00:39:55,Jesse liked dinosaurs.
609,00:40:08,00:40:10,Let's see what Hodges can tell us.
610,00:40:13,00:40:20,"The GCMS soil analysis found Cadaverine, Putrescine and several other organic compounds."
611,00:40:20,00:40:23,"Yeah. English, please?"
612,00:40:23,00:40:26,It means there was a body buried in Karen's backyard.
613,00:40:26,00:40:29,Just too long ago to get any DNA.
614,00:40:29,00:40:31,But Hodges also found traces of Olanzapine.
615,00:40:31,00:40:45,"Well, that's interesting, becasue a warrant came through on Karen Matthews' medical records, and after her son was born, Karen was treated for postpartum psychosis, which her doctors treated by prescribing Olanzapine."
616,00:40:45,00:40:49,Even a small amount of that stuff would be lethal to a two-year-old.
617,00:40:49,00:40:52,Karen is already mentally fragile when her husband is killed.
618,00:40:52,00:41:03,"She gets into a very heated argument with the in-laws at his funeral, goes over the deep end, poisons Jesse and buries him in the backyard near the fence."
619,00:41:03,00:41:06,BRASS: But then she digs him up. Why?
620,00:41:06,00:41:11,GRISSOM: We have evidence to suggest that the neighbor's dog was digging in Karen's backyard.
621,00:41:11,00:41:15,The neighbor claims that Karen killed his dog.
622,00:41:15,00:41:23,"If the dog detected decomp and dug near the grave, Karen may have moved the body to protect him."
623,00:41:23,00:41:25,"BRASS: So, where's Jesse's body?"
624,00:41:25,00:41:30,WILLOWS: Nick found a patch of tissue and hair in the trunk of Karen's car.
625,00:41:30,00:41:31,The DNA matches the toothbrush.
626,00:41:32,00:41:36,"If Karen doesn't tell us where to look, I doubt we'll ever find the body."
627,00:41:37,00:41:40,"You know, as long as I do this job, I can never understand how a mother can kill her child."
628,00:41:40,00:41:44,GRISSOM: Euripedes tried to understand it when he wroteMedea.
629,00:41:44,00:41:55,"""I will slay my children without delaying long enough to hand them over to some more savage hand."" Medea, like Karen, was a soldier's wife."
630,00:41:56,00:42:03,"WILLOWS: His father was a soldier, his grandfather was a soldier, Karen did not want that for Jesse."
631,00:42:04,00:42:05,"Well, it's still murder."
632,00:42:19,00:42:25,(faintly): Mommy... Mommy!
