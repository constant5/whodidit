1,00:00:09,00:00:10,(sighs)
2,00:00:10,00:00:12,I am not ready for this.
3,00:00:12,00:00:14,"Yeah, you are."
4,00:00:14,00:00:16,"Besides, you got to be."
5,00:00:16,00:00:18,Dr. Ray's still on leave from the concussion.
6,00:00:18,00:00:19,We're all tapped out.
7,00:00:19,00:00:22,I got a multiple in Northtown.
8,00:00:22,00:00:24,"Call me if you need anything, okay?"
9,00:00:33,00:00:36,(indistinct chatter)
10,00:00:38,00:00:40,(garbled police radio transmission)
11,00:01:05,00:01:07,(flashbulb pops)
12,00:01:13,00:01:15,(flashbulb pops)
13,00:01:17,00:01:19,(flashbulb pops)
14,00:01:24,00:01:26,(coughing)
15,00:01:26,00:01:28,"Damn it, Derrick, you're screwing up my one-to-ones."
16,00:01:28,00:01:29,DERRICK: Sorry.
17,00:01:29,00:01:32,This stuff is giving me the desire for pancakes.
18,00:01:32,00:01:35,"WOMAN: Yeah, me, too. (laughter)"
19,00:01:35,00:01:37,(groans) Kids.
20,00:01:37,00:01:46,"Okay, crime cadets, this is serious crime-fighting business, so... back to being dead, please."
21,00:01:46,00:01:49,"Excuse me, CSI Hodges?"
22,00:01:49,00:01:50,Yes.
23,00:01:50,00:01:54,"CSI Hodges, th-that's me. Katy Cypress. Nice to meet you."
24,00:01:54,00:01:58,"Look, I know that this is just a program for wannabe CSIs."
25,00:01:58,00:02:02,And this exercise does test observational and evidence-collection skills.
26,00:02:02,00:02:05,Yes. Is it at least based on a real case?
27,00:02:05,00:02:07,No.
28,00:02:07,00:02:08,This is just brute-force rote work.
29,00:02:08,00:02:12,I couldn't agree with you more. The real fun is nailing bad guys.
30,00:02:12,00:02:16,And that's about interpreting the evidence and solving a real mystery.
31,00:02:16,00:02:19,"That's what... you do, and that's what I want to do."
32,00:02:22,00:02:23,Okay.
33,00:02:23,00:02:24,I'll tell you what.
34,00:02:25,00:02:34,"Let's finish up here, and then you grab a couple of your cadet buddies and meet me at the Crime Lab for arealchallenge-- ifyou're up to it."
35,00:02:34,00:02:35,"Oh, I am up to it."
36,00:02:35,00:02:36,Guillermo.
37,00:02:36,00:02:38,He'd love to do it.
38,00:02:38,00:02:40,(laughs): He has no life.
39,00:02:40,00:02:43,"I collect spores, molds and fungi."
40,00:02:43,00:02:45,"You, too, Derrick-- it'll be fun."
41,00:02:46,00:02:47,(beeping)
42,00:02:50,00:02:52,Grab a seat.
43,00:02:53,00:02:56,(laughs)
44,00:02:56,00:02:58,Are we waiting on Derrick?
45,00:02:58,00:03:00,"Uh, no. He's not coming."
46,00:03:00,00:03:02,He has video-game issues.
47,00:03:02,00:03:07,Ah. These files are from a case we investigated four months ago.
48,00:03:07,00:03:10,You said you wanted to match wits with real CSIs.
49,00:03:10,00:03:11,Now's your chance.
50,00:03:11,00:03:18,Among the many consequences of a construction boom are structures that are thrown together with little regard for building codes.
51,00:03:18,00:03:20,The fire department responded quickly.
52,00:03:20,00:03:26,"But even so, the lower three levels of this apartment building were almost completely consumed."
53,00:03:26,00:03:33,"The firemen, or, as we like to call them, the ""Evidence Eradication Crew,"" got the blaze under control."
54,00:03:33,00:03:38,But they were utterly unprepared for the astonishing sight waiting there to greet them.
55,00:03:39,00:03:40,"Oh, boy, do I remember that one."
56,00:03:40,00:03:43,It was an incredible case.
57,00:03:43,00:03:46,"I mean, like, you would never even believe it was possible unless you saw the evidence yourself."
58,00:03:46,00:03:49,"Yeah, which is why I was about to show it to them."
59,00:03:49,00:03:51,Oh.
60,00:03:51,00:03:52,Hey. I'm Wendy.
61,00:03:52,00:03:54,And you are...?
62,00:03:54,00:03:55,Crime cadets.
63,00:03:55,00:03:56,Guillermo.
64,00:03:56,00:04:00,"KATY: Could we see the body already, please?"
65,00:04:00,00:04:01,Yeah. Okay.
66,00:04:01,00:04:02,Hey.
67,00:04:02,00:04:04,I tell it better than you.
68,00:04:04,00:04:08,"Trust me, you guys are really gonna enjoy this."
69,00:04:08,00:04:16,"What used to be the parking garage was filled with the contents of a dozen apartments, everything charred virtually beyond recognition..."
70,00:04:16,00:04:20,with one incredible exception.
71,00:04:20,00:04:22,The CSIs had never seen anything like it.
72,00:04:22,00:04:24,I've never seen anything like it.
73,00:04:24,00:04:27,There's barely a mark on her.
74,00:04:27,00:04:35,"Given the amount of available fuel consumed by this fire, I'd say we should be looking at a pile of roasted flesh and bone."
75,00:04:35,00:04:38,The body must have been put here after the fire was extinguished.
76,00:04:38,00:04:41,There were a dozen cops and two dozen firefighters on the scene.
77,00:04:41,00:04:48,The likelihood of anyone carrying a body intothis and getting out unseen is... slim to none.
78,00:04:49,00:04:51,HODGES: That's when I said...
79,00:04:51,00:04:54,It's as if... the fire refused to touch her.
80,00:04:54,00:04:55,Excuse me?
81,00:04:55,00:04:57,And then Wendy said...
82,00:04:59,00:05:04,"HODGES: The question is, is it miracle or murder?"
83,00:05:08,00:05:11,"Uh, please familiarize yourself with this evidence report."
84,00:05:14,00:05:17,"(quietly): That's what you're doing, you're lying to children?"
85,00:05:17,00:05:18,It's a teaching exercise.
86,00:05:18,00:05:20,It's an exercise in self-love.
87,00:05:20,00:05:22,"Just play along and be a role model, please?"
88,00:05:22,00:05:25,"Uh, no. Why would I play along with you?"
89,00:05:25,00:05:30,"Because if you can't even imagine yourself out in the field, how will you ever expect Ecklie to?"
90,00:05:32,00:05:35,"(loudly): Okay, so there we were."
91,00:05:36,00:05:39,"The question is, is it miracle..."
92,00:05:39,00:05:40,or murder?
93,00:05:40,00:05:45,"Either way, she tried as best as she could to survive."
94,00:05:45,00:05:47,(laughs)
95,00:05:49,00:05:52,Sounds like something I would say.
96,00:06:26,00:06:28,"STOKES: You look like you've dropped a few pounds there, Barclay."
97,00:06:28,00:06:29,You been working out or something?
98,00:06:29,00:06:31,"Yeah, new diet."
99,00:06:31,00:06:33,"No more donuts or sugary snacks, just-just pure protein."
100,00:06:33,00:06:34,"All beef, all day."
101,00:06:35,00:06:36,Trading the diabetes for a heart attack.
102,00:06:36,00:06:38,(phone rings) Good call.
103,00:06:38,00:06:39,"Yeah, what's up, Cath?"
104,00:06:39,00:06:41,I'm in Mega-Lo-Mattress hell.
105,00:06:41,00:06:44,Found another DB in a quilt. I'll be here a while.
106,00:06:44,00:06:47,"Oh, that's okay-- I just wrapped up my 419, I'll hold down the f... (man clears throat)"
107,00:06:47,00:06:49,(retching)
108,00:06:49,00:06:50,(laughter)
109,00:06:50,00:06:52,Nicky?
110,00:06:52,00:06:53,(laughs)
111,00:06:53,00:06:54,"WOMAN: Oh, my God!"
112,00:06:54,00:06:56,(loud retching)
113,00:06:56,00:06:58,Nicky? You there?
114,00:06:58,00:07:00,"Yeah, yeah, I'm here."
115,00:07:00,00:07:03,(retching)
116,00:07:10,00:07:13,"Yeah, it looks like I'm gonna be tied up for a little while longer here, Catherine."
117,00:07:14,00:07:15,BARCLAY: Need paramedics and HazMat down to the squad.
118,00:07:18,00:07:19,"GUILLERMO: Okay, I see it."
119,00:07:20,00:07:25,"The concrete around the furnace is pitted and chipped, most likely from rapid thermal expansion."
120,00:07:25,00:07:29,"It's called ""spalling."" Now, take a look at the vent pipes."
121,00:07:29,00:07:30,What do they tell you?
122,00:07:30,00:07:31,They're rusty.
123,00:07:31,00:07:34,And since fire is essentially a rapid oxidation reaction...
124,00:07:34,00:07:36,It means that the furnace is most likely where the fire started.
125,00:07:36,00:07:37,Very good.
126,00:07:37,00:07:38,This has got to be arson.
127,00:07:39,00:07:40,What makes you say that?
128,00:07:40,00:07:44,Most fires are either started because of insurance fraud or to cover up evidence of a crime.
129,00:07:44,00:07:46,GUILLERMO: And that certainly is a crime.
130,00:07:46,00:07:48,Were all the tenants accounted for?
131,00:07:48,00:07:50,And were any able to identify the victim?
132,00:07:50,00:07:52,Good questions...
133,00:07:52,00:07:53,for a detective.
134,00:07:58,00:08:00,"So, all the tenants have been accounted for."
135,00:08:00,00:08:04,"I showed her picture around, but, uh, no one recognized her."
136,00:08:05,00:08:07,Or so they say.
137,00:08:07,00:08:11,"Thanks, Captain. We'll, uh, let you know what we come up with. (chuckles)"
138,00:08:11,00:08:13,That's great.
139,00:08:13,00:08:17,You know what? Nobody gives a damn about life or death.
140,00:08:17,00:08:19,That's the truth. So why should I?
141,00:08:19,00:08:20,Why should you?
142,00:08:20,00:08:23,(slurring): Do you know what the best thing to do is?
143,00:08:23,00:08:27,Is to just to go home...
144,00:08:27,00:08:30,and cuddle up with someone you love...
145,00:08:30,00:08:32,and just...
146,00:08:33,00:08:34,forget...
147,00:08:35,00:08:39,...just forget about all this-this...
148,00:08:39,00:08:41,madness.
149,00:08:41,00:08:43,(Hodges exhales)
150,00:08:43,00:08:46,"But that would let them all off the hook, wouldn't it?"
151,00:08:46,00:08:48,"So, you know what I'm gonna do?"
152,00:08:48,00:08:58,"I'm gonna go home, I'm gonna get painted up, put on some Kevlar, go on a five-state shooting spree and take out these scumbags one at a time. Screw 'em."
153,00:08:58,00:09:06,And then let copper-jacketed justice take its sweet release.
154,00:09:10,00:09:12,"Ooh, ouch."
155,00:09:12,00:09:13,(chuckles) What?
156,00:09:13,00:09:15,(laughing)
157,00:09:15,00:09:17,What?!
158,00:09:17,00:09:18,What the heck? No.
159,00:09:18,00:09:21,"(laughs): No, I'm not going to do that, all right?"
160,00:09:21,00:09:23,(sputters)
161,00:09:23,00:09:24,"No, I choose life."
162,00:09:26,00:09:28,Keep me apprised.
163,00:09:28,00:09:33,"HODGES: FYI, the alcoholism rate among police officers is double the national average."
164,00:09:33,00:09:34,Suicide rate's triple.
165,00:09:35,00:09:37,"Really? KATY: Hey, uh, wait a second."
166,00:09:37,00:09:39,That tub-- where's it from?
167,00:09:39,00:09:41,"It's, uh, from apartment 2B, second floor."
168,00:09:42,00:09:45,SIMMS: Whose tenant just happened to be out of town right before the fire.
169,00:09:45,00:09:47,Does he have a record?
170,00:09:47,00:09:49,"No, but he wasn't exactly a model citizen, either."
171,00:09:50,00:09:54,He'd had run-ins with the landlord before over illegal sublets. Okay.
172,00:09:54,00:09:56,Check this out...
173,00:09:56,00:10:00,off-the-books sublet girl was in the tub when the fire breaks out.
174,00:10:00,00:10:03,"She dies of carbon monoxide poisoning, leaving no marks on the body."
175,00:10:03,00:10:09,She was still in the tub when the flames torched the floor and it all came tumbling down.
176,00:10:09,00:10:17,"So, the bath oil on her skin acts like a shield long enough to protect her from the flames until she is discovered. That's not a bad theory."
177,00:10:17,00:10:18,"And for a while, it was our theory."
178,00:10:18,00:10:20,It was also the wrong theory.
179,00:10:20,00:10:31,"HODGES: Most essential oils in bath gels have a flash point of under 250 degrees. With a fire that hot, it would've actually drawn the flames to her, not protect her. All right."
180,00:10:31,00:10:37,"Well, since we know it's arson, if we identify the victim, it could lead us to the arsonist. Yeah."
181,00:10:37,00:10:39,What'd you get from Autopsy?
182,00:10:39,00:10:40,"For that, you'll need a coroner."
183,00:10:40,00:10:44,"And, uh, luckily, I happen to know where we can find one."
184,00:10:44,00:10:46,Take five.
185,00:10:47,00:10:49,"ANDREWS: Hey, Hodges. Oh, hey, Henry."
186,00:10:50,00:10:57,Yes? Remember that time you said that thing about your having a higher commitment to the lab and the pursuit of justice?
187,00:10:57,00:10:59,"Yeah, I've probably said that more than once. Yeah, you have."
188,00:10:59,00:11:02,"For the record, I find it admirable and Wendy does, too."
189,00:11:02,00:11:04,She does? Yeah.
190,00:11:04,00:11:07,We were chatting about it last weekend at the blood bank.
191,00:11:07,00:11:08,We donate together.
192,00:11:08,00:11:09,Oh.
193,00:11:09,00:11:10,"No, B-positive."
194,00:11:10,00:11:13,"Actually, Wendy and I have a lot in common."
195,00:11:13,00:11:21,"We dabble in calligraphy, we're both passionate about French neoclassical architecture, and we are both allergic to eggplant."
196,00:11:21,00:11:30,"Look, I was just thinking that I should ask her out on a date, and I assume that you'd be cool with that, due to your admirable commitment to the lab."
197,00:11:30,00:11:34,So are you cool with that?
198,00:11:36,00:11:38,Totally. Great.
199,00:11:38,00:11:41,"Great, yes, see? That is awesome."
200,00:11:41,00:11:42,"Thank you, you're a man of principle."
201,00:11:42,00:11:44,(chuckles)
202,00:11:44,00:11:47,"Uh, Wendy."
203,00:11:47,00:11:49,SIMMS: Hey. ANDREWS: Hello.
204,00:11:49,00:11:51,What's up? Good. How are you? Hi.
205,00:11:51,00:11:54,"Um, I was wondering if you want to go out to eat tonight after work."
206,00:11:54,00:11:56,Yeah. Yeah? Okay.
207,00:11:56,00:11:58,"All right, yeah, I'm just gonna... (Simms chuckling)"
208,00:12:02,00:12:04,"MAN (over P.A.): Attention, all personnel..."
209,00:12:04,00:12:07,quarantine is still in effect until further notice.
210,00:12:07,00:12:10,Continue to observe all class-four protocol.
211,00:12:11,00:12:13,(devices beeping)
212,00:12:13,00:12:16,"No anthrax, no ricin, no botulinum."
213,00:12:16,00:12:19,And no plague and no tularemia.
214,00:12:19,00:12:20,"We're good, people."
215,00:12:20,00:12:22,Area's clear.
216,00:12:25,00:12:27,(sighs)
217,00:12:27,00:12:32,"Well, if it's not in the air or a contact toxin, it has to be something they ate or drank."
218,00:12:33,00:12:38,Wouldn't be the first time a bunch of cops cheaped out on a dinner and ended up spewing out of both ends.
219,00:12:38,00:12:39,You're a CSI.
220,00:12:39,00:12:41,It's not your problem.
221,00:12:41,00:12:45,I think I'm making it mine tonight.
222,00:12:46,00:12:51,SANDERS: Have you encountered any cases recently with similar symptoms?
223,00:12:51,00:12:54,"Projectile vomit, sweats, diarrhea?"
224,00:12:54,00:12:56,"I mean, it could be almost anything thing."
225,00:12:56,00:12:59,"You know, there's a lot of stuff going around."
226,00:12:59,00:13:01,This town is a petri dish.
227,00:13:02,00:13:05,(grunting)
228,00:13:05,00:13:08,"Hey, Jenkins..."
229,00:13:08,00:13:10,how you doing? (moans)
230,00:13:10,00:13:13,I will get out of here in a second to let you get back to sleep.
231,00:13:13,00:13:18,But I need you to tell me everything you had to eat or drink today.
232,00:13:18,00:13:20,(muttering)
233,00:13:23,00:13:25,(retching)
234,00:13:26,00:13:29,"Uh, nurse?"
235,00:13:30,00:13:36,"Hey, kids, you know, a lot of people believe that all a coroner does is determine cause, manner, and time of death."
236,00:13:36,00:13:39,"And in a case like this, there is so much more to discover."
237,00:13:39,00:13:42,All you have to do is look.
238,00:13:42,00:13:44,Her prints weren't in the system.
239,00:13:44,00:13:47,And no bodies matching her description were in missing persons.
240,00:13:47,00:13:49,The condition of her...
241,00:13:51,00:13:54,...area is consistent with recent sexual activity.
242,00:13:54,00:13:58,"But her wet mount came back negative for, uh..."
243,00:13:58,00:14:00,Semen? Thank you.
244,00:14:00,00:14:04,I believe this woman had safe sex before she died. GUILLERMO: Could we get to the C.O.D. please?
245,00:14:04,00:14:07,Not so fast.
246,00:14:07,00:14:08,You'll miss it.
247,00:14:08,00:14:18,"The victim had very poor dental hygiene: plaque with numerous cavities, crowns made of white gold-- a substance not commonly used in the United States."
248,00:14:18,00:14:21,All of which led me to conclude that the victim was Russian...
249,00:14:21,00:14:22,GUILLERMO: Russian or Eastern European.
250,00:14:22,00:14:24,Obviously.
251,00:14:24,00:14:28,"This is, uh, ""Vokovushka,"" the Russian Mighty Mouse."
252,00:14:28,00:14:30,Perhaps she was a tourist?
253,00:14:31,00:14:35,What are these glossy patches on her skin?
254,00:14:35,00:14:36,I-I don't know.
255,00:14:36,00:14:38,I sent samples to Trace.
256,00:14:38,00:14:39,Talk to Trace.
257,00:14:39,00:14:41,"Actually, Trace loves to talk."
258,00:14:41,00:14:44,I'd suggest carving out a couple hours and taking snacks. C.O.D.?
259,00:14:44,00:14:46,Right.
260,00:14:47,00:14:49,There's no soot in the trachea.
261,00:14:49,00:14:52,"(cat meowing, man laughs nearby)"
262,00:14:52,00:14:54,Lung tissue color is normal.
263,00:14:55,00:14:56,(laughing)
264,00:14:56,00:15:01,"(laughter, meowing continue)"
265,00:15:01,00:15:04,There's no sign of carbon monoxide pink at all. (meowing)
266,00:15:05,00:15:07,Meow.
267,00:15:07,00:15:08,(phone ringing)
268,00:15:08,00:15:10,(sighs)
269,00:15:10,00:15:13,"Hello, Morgue."
270,00:15:14,00:15:16,Of course. I'm always ready.
271,00:15:16,00:15:17,Right.
272,00:15:18,00:15:21,"All right, the CSIs are on their way down."
273,00:15:21,00:15:24,She didn't inhale smoke.
274,00:15:24,00:15:26,Give me your notes. Give me your notes.
275,00:15:26,00:15:28,Get out!
276,00:15:28,00:15:29,(clears throat)
277,00:15:30,00:15:36,"PHILLIPS: You see, tox revealed a BAC of .30 with several benzodiazepine sedatives, along with zolpidem in her system."
278,00:15:37,00:15:38,"Now, while the individual levels were sublethal..."
279,00:15:38,00:15:40,The combination was...
280,00:15:40,00:15:42,Deadly. That's right.
281,00:15:42,00:15:44,C.O.D. was multiple drug overdose.
282,00:15:44,00:15:46,The victim was dead before the fire.
283,00:15:47,00:15:49,I was about to say that.
284,00:15:49,00:15:51,Too bad I said it first.
285,00:15:58,00:16:00,STOKES: Here you go.
286,00:16:01,00:16:02,"Now, we're starting off small."
287,00:16:02,00:16:06,This is only the stuff from the desks of the officers who actually got sick.
288,00:16:07,00:16:08,This is starting small?
289,00:16:08,00:16:10,Yep.
290,00:16:10,00:16:12,"And you better get the GCMS fired up, boss."
291,00:16:12,00:16:14,"Greg's bringing in vomit, blood and fecals."
292,00:16:14,00:16:15,(slapping)
293,00:16:17,00:16:18,(tapping rhythmically)
294,00:16:18,00:16:20,Get it going.
295,00:16:22,00:16:34,"SIMMS: In an arson investigation, after you find the area of origin, the next thing you look for is any sort of incendiary device, faulty wiring, flammable fluid-- basically any ignition source in the general vicinity."
296,00:16:35,00:16:36,"Hey, Wendy."
297,00:16:36,00:16:38,Come take a look at this.
298,00:16:41,00:16:43,It's a natural gas line.
299,00:16:43,00:16:45,It's uncapped.
300,00:16:47,00:16:49,There's no tarnish on these tool marks.
301,00:16:49,00:16:51,This was done recently.
302,00:16:51,00:16:52,Yeah.
303,00:16:53,00:16:56,Did you find the gas cap at the scene?
304,00:16:58,00:16:59,Hodges. Hmm?
305,00:16:59,00:17:01,"Uh, no."
306,00:17:01,00:17:03,And we sifted through a ton of char.
307,00:17:03,00:17:07,KATY: I'm sure you're still finding soot in places you don't want to talk about.
308,00:17:11,00:17:13,"Well, no gas cap means no accident."
309,00:17:13,00:17:16,"That proves that, uh, we're right about arson."
310,00:17:16,00:17:17,So it would seem.
311,00:17:18,00:17:20,(grinding)
312,00:17:20,00:17:25,SIMMS: We removed a section of the pipe to preserve the tool marks.
313,00:17:27,00:17:34,But what we didn't know was that this crime scene-- it very well could have been our last.
314,00:17:34,00:17:35,(grinding)
315,00:17:36,00:17:38,(clattering)
316,00:17:38,00:17:40,No!
317,00:17:50,00:17:51,(sighs)
318,00:17:51,00:17:56,"SIMMS: Shortly thereafter, the city declared the building structurally unsound, and..."
319,00:17:56,00:17:58,that was the last time CSI was allowed in.
320,00:18:00,00:18:01,He saved my life.
321,00:18:03,00:18:05,"He saved the evidence, too."
322,00:18:11,00:18:13,SANDERS (sighs): You got to be kidding me.
323,00:18:13,00:18:15,"What do you mean, the GCMS run isn't done yet?"
324,00:18:15,00:18:16,It was supposed to be done an hour ago.
325,00:18:16,00:18:17,I don't know what's going on.
326,00:18:18,00:18:23,"Well, I have a bunch of sick cops who need answers, and if you have to pull another shift to get it done, you're going to have to."
327,00:18:23,00:18:25,Let me look at this. (sighs)
328,00:18:25,00:18:29,"Henry, the run cycle's been altered."
329,00:18:29,00:18:32,You set it to perform a cleaning and test cycle after each sample.
330,00:18:32,00:18:35,"No, I didn't set it like that. I swear."
331,00:18:35,00:18:38,"Well, maybe a power interruption could have reset it to a default."
332,00:18:38,00:18:40,There you go.
333,00:18:40,00:18:41,Problem solved.
334,00:18:41,00:18:42,You lucked out.
335,00:18:42,00:18:44,Yeah.
336,00:18:54,00:18:56,The uncapped gas line was the fuel.
337,00:18:56,00:18:59,What else do you need to make a fire?
338,00:18:59,00:19:00,A spark.
339,00:19:00,00:19:01,That's right.
340,00:19:01,00:19:05,And I've got a whole box full of sparks right over here.
341,00:19:05,00:19:07,Take a look.
342,00:19:13,00:19:18,"According to this maintenance record, this breaker box was serviced the same day as the fire."
343,00:19:18,00:19:21,GUILLERMO: And it looks like the same company maintains the gas lines. HODGES: They do.
344,00:19:21,00:19:27,"The police questioned the maintenance man, but the CSIs found this in his van."
345,00:19:29,00:19:30,KATY: The pipe cap?
346,00:19:31,00:19:33,The arsonist kept evidence of the crime on him?
347,00:19:33,00:19:35,Serial killers often keep souvenirs.
348,00:19:35,00:19:41,"The maintenance man told the cops that he had gone to the apartment building to service the gas line and removed the cap, which had become corroded."
349,00:19:41,00:19:47,"But when he returned to his van to find a replacement, he found he didn't have one, so he left."
350,00:19:47,00:19:49,He left the gas line uncapped?
351,00:19:49,00:19:50,He said he forgot.
352,00:19:50,00:19:58,"He thought he closed the gas line completely, but he must have left a slow leak, which he didn't notice because he was losing his sense of smell-- or so he claimed."
353,00:19:58,00:19:59,His medical records confirmed that.
354,00:19:59,00:20:02,"GUILLERMO: So, natural gas gradually filled the room..."
355,00:20:02,00:20:05,"KATY: Until there was enough, so that when the furnace clicked on..."
356,00:20:05,00:20:07,(clicking)
357,00:20:07,00:20:08,Whoosh.
358,00:20:08,00:20:09,Indeed.
359,00:20:09,00:20:11,It was an accident.
360,00:20:11,00:20:14,Which means that it wasn't set to destroy the victim's body.
361,00:20:14,00:20:15,Our theory was completely wrong.
362,00:20:15,00:20:17,HODGES: You said you wanted a challenge.
363,00:20:17,00:20:18,ANDREWS: Wendy!
364,00:20:18,00:20:19,Hey. Hi.
365,00:20:19,00:20:21,"Uh, I got great news."
366,00:20:21,00:20:26,"I had to call in a couple of favors, but I got us a reservation at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant."
367,00:20:26,00:20:27,"It's, like, the best view in Vegas."
368,00:20:27,00:20:29,Wow.
369,00:20:29,00:20:31,"ANDREWS: That's cool, right? SIMMS: It-it's, uh..."
370,00:20:31,00:20:35,a little more fancy-pants than the cop diner that I'd been picturing.
371,00:20:35,00:20:44,"(chuckling): No. I, um... I was going to surprise you, but then I thought, you know, the gentlemanly thing to do would be to let you know, so you could dress appropriately for the occasion."
372,00:20:44,00:20:46,I'm going to go home on my lunch break and get my suit.
373,00:20:46,00:20:48,You're wearing a suit?
374,00:20:49,00:20:52,Ce sera parfaît.
375,00:20:53,00:20:59,"It means, ""It will be perfect."" SIMMS: Um..."
376,00:21:00,00:21:01,(chuckling)
377,00:21:01,00:21:07,"STOKES: According to Henry, there were no drugs, poisons or toxins in any of the food or drink samples I collected."
378,00:21:07,00:21:09,We'll just have to test every consumable in the station.
379,00:21:09,00:21:11,It's shigella.
380,00:21:11,00:21:15,Positive? I called in a favor at the hospital's microbio lab.
381,00:21:15,00:21:18,We just did cultures on each of the sick unis.
382,00:21:18,00:21:19,They all have it.
383,00:21:19,00:21:22,"Okay, well, shigella is food-borne."
384,00:21:22,00:21:25,It typically vectors through unsanitary handling practices.
385,00:21:25,00:21:28,"Yeah, but something doesn't make sense."
386,00:21:28,00:21:31,According to what the unis told me between pukes... (man clears throat)
387,00:21:31,00:21:38,"...none of them ate any of the same things today, so how did they all come down with the same bacterial infection?"
388,00:21:38,00:21:41,STOKES: I might be able to answer that. I'll call you back.
389,00:21:51,00:21:53,"Hey, Nick. What's up?"
390,00:21:53,00:21:54,"Hold out your hands, Metcalf."
391,00:21:56,00:21:59,"And, uh, don't touch me, please."
392,00:22:05,00:22:12,"So, basically, we have an accidental fire and a victim whose body managed to remain unburned in it."
393,00:22:12,00:22:17,"GUILLERMO: These patches on her skin, did you guys get anything useful from Trace?"
394,00:22:17,00:22:19,You always get something from Trace.
395,00:22:37,00:22:39,CSI Hodges. Trace Tech Langston.
396,00:22:39,00:22:40,What do you have for me?
397,00:22:41,00:22:43,"The question, CSI Hodges, is what don't I have for you?"
398,00:22:43,00:22:49,"I used, uh, polarized light microscopy to identify the glossy patches on your victim's skin."
399,00:22:49,00:22:54,"And not to sound corny, but I think you'll find the results a-maize-ing."
400,00:22:56,00:22:58,Starch molecules.
401,00:22:59,00:23:00,"Vaporized cornstarch, to be precise."
402,00:23:00,00:23:08,"Did you know the word ""cornstarch"" is derived from the Middle English ""sterchen"" meaning ""to stiffen,"" which is apropos to the condition of your vic."
403,00:23:08,00:23:13,"(laughs) Langston, the way that your rapier wit envelopes critical information, is just so..."
404,00:23:13,00:23:15,Thrilling?
405,00:23:15,00:23:17,That's exactly what I was going to say.
406,00:23:17,00:23:20,"Now, you say you derived these results from a simple polarized light test?"
407,00:23:20,00:23:23,Lesser men would have resorted to using the GCMS.
408,00:23:23,00:23:26,Why use a sledgehammer to kill a fly?
409,00:23:26,00:23:27,I bow to the master. Nonsense.
410,00:23:27,00:23:32,"""You are great. I am great."" M-5. The Ultimate Computer."
411,00:23:32,00:23:33,"Star Trek,the original series."
412,00:23:33,00:23:35,Is there any other?
413,00:23:35,00:23:37,It's like you're inside my head.
414,00:23:37,00:23:40,(both laughing)
415,00:23:40,00:23:42,That Trace tech sounds kinda...
416,00:23:43,00:23:44,Obsequious.
417,00:23:45,00:23:46,Misunderstood.
418,00:23:47,00:23:50,You look concerned.
419,00:23:53,00:23:55,I am.
420,00:23:56,00:23:58,How does somebody get coated in vaporized cornstarch?
421,00:23:59,00:24:01,Body powder?
422,00:24:01,00:24:03,SIMMS: It's a health-conscious alternative to talc.
423,00:24:03,00:24:07,I doubt that powder would be thick enough to account for...
424,00:24:08,00:24:10,Peanuts.
425,00:24:10,00:24:11,Cornstarch peanuts.
426,00:24:11,00:24:13,Packing material.
427,00:24:13,00:24:17,She was killed and packed in the box with the peanuts.
428,00:24:17,00:24:22,"The cardboard and the cornstarch acted as insulation, to protect the body from the flames."
429,00:24:22,00:24:29,"Until the firemen arrived, blasting everything with their hoses, which separated her from whatever remained of the box."
430,00:24:30,00:24:31,Congratulations.
431,00:24:31,00:24:34,You have just matched wits with the CSIs.
432,00:24:34,00:24:35,SIMMS: Nicely done. Hmm!
433,00:24:35,00:24:37,"Okay, so what's next?"
434,00:24:37,00:24:40,"Based on what we have here, nothing."
435,00:24:40,00:24:41,That's as far we got.
436,00:24:41,00:24:43,But we never ID'd the body.
437,00:24:43,00:24:44,Or the killer.
438,00:24:44,00:24:45,Neither did we.
439,00:24:45,00:24:48,What?
440,00:24:50,00:24:51,That sucks. HODGES: Yes.
441,00:24:51,00:24:56,"But what doesn't suck is that yesterday, the city declared the building structurally sound."
442,00:24:56,00:25:04,"So, after you have your parents fax me their written permission indemnifying the Crime Lab for any injuries you may sustain, we're going on a field trip."
443,00:25:04,00:25:06,"So, my suit's done then?"
444,00:25:06,00:25:08,"Great. No, I'm on my way."
445,00:25:08,00:25:11,"You didn't crease the pants though, did you, Mom?"
446,00:25:11,00:25:13,'Cause there is nothing worse than...
447,00:25:13,00:25:15,"(rattling, hissing) Huh?"
448,00:25:15,00:25:17,"Oh, no. No, no, no. I'll call you back."
449,00:25:17,00:25:19,"No, no-no-no."
450,00:25:19,00:25:21,Not today.
451,00:25:23,00:25:25,What?
452,00:25:26,00:25:29,Ow.
453,00:25:29,00:25:31,(coughing)
454,00:25:33,00:25:35,Ah! No!
455,00:25:36,00:25:37,Car trouble?
456,00:25:38,00:25:39,"Yeah, no kidding."
457,00:25:39,00:25:42,"This ruins my whole lunch break, and I had things to do."
458,00:25:44,00:25:46,"You know, Henry, maybe you should stay out of parking garages."
459,00:25:46,00:25:50,Bad things seem to happen to you there.
460,00:25:50,00:25:54,(music plays over stereo)
461,00:26:09,00:26:11,WILLOWS: Henry?
462,00:26:11,00:26:16,"Hmm? I don't mind taking time out of my day to check out your radiator hose, 'cause, clearly, it means a lot to you."
463,00:26:16,00:26:18,But you need to back off. You are ripe.
464,00:26:18,00:26:20,Sorry.
465,00:26:20,00:26:22,My car's been spending a lot of time in the shop.
466,00:26:22,00:26:25,I just wanted to know what's wrong before I take it in again.
467,00:26:25,00:26:27,Well...
468,00:26:27,00:26:29,I can tell you one thing.
469,00:26:29,00:26:30,This is not defective.
470,00:26:30,00:26:37,"These holes are straight and uniform, which suggests they were mechanically introduced from the outside in."
471,00:26:38,00:26:40,Somebody poked my hose.
472,00:26:41,00:26:42,(whispers): Sorry.
473,00:26:42,00:26:47,"Sure, yeah, you could have a shady mechanic, but as far as car sabotage goes, this is amateur hour."
474,00:26:47,00:26:51,"I mean, you really want to do some damage, you pop out a spark plug and throw rocks into the cylinder."
475,00:26:51,00:26:55,Radiator hose-- third grade stuff.
476,00:26:55,00:26:58,You been pissing off a lot of third graders lately?
477,00:26:59,00:27:01,Hodges! (groans)
478,00:27:03,00:27:08,"You know, when you told me to join you for some fun, I really didn't realize it was going to be as wonderful as this."
479,00:27:08,00:27:13,"As your humble tech, I would like to thank you very much for entrusting me with such an important job."
480,00:27:13,00:27:20,"Listen, just remember to label all bindled evidence. Chain of custody is not just a suggestion, you know."
481,00:27:20,00:27:21,"Don't push it, Hodges."
482,00:27:21,00:27:22,Okay. All right.
483,00:27:23,00:27:25,Hey.
484,00:27:26,00:27:27,Did I miss anything?
485,00:27:27,00:27:29,"Thanks for texting me, K."
486,00:27:29,00:27:31,"Sure, I mean, the team isn't the same without..."
487,00:27:31,00:27:33,Oh!
488,00:27:33,00:27:34,(both laughing)
489,00:27:34,00:27:36,Okay.
490,00:27:38,00:27:39,Oh. Yes.
491,00:27:39,00:27:41,(laughing)
492,00:27:41,00:27:44,(coughs) Fire scenes always smell this bad?
493,00:27:44,00:27:46,Yes.
494,00:27:47,00:27:51,KATY: Just let me know if you find anything that matches the burn pattern that we found earlier.
495,00:27:52,00:27:55,Why do you feel compelled to lie to us?
496,00:27:55,00:27:57,"About what, exactly?"
497,00:27:57,00:28:01,You don't have to be a real CSI to know that you and Hodges are not.
498,00:28:01,00:28:10,"I suspect Hodges is a Trace tech, because I doubt any real CSI would wax so rhapsodic about that particular specialty."
499,00:28:11,00:28:15,"And, clearly, that man does not relish being outdoors."
500,00:28:15,00:28:24,"(splutters) That, and the fact that you two obviously spend an inordinate amount of time with each other, would suggest that you're most likely a lab tech, too."
501,00:28:25,00:28:27,I'm DNA.
502,00:28:27,00:28:28,"So, why lie?"
503,00:28:28,00:28:37,I guess I'm afraid that maybe I'm going to wake up one morning and I'm going to think that I spent most of life fighting crime in a test tube.
504,00:28:38,00:28:45,Just because something is the size of a molecule doesn't mean that it can't be filled with intrigue and excitement.
505,00:28:45,00:28:51,"CSIs gather the evidence, but analysis is really what gives it meaning."
506,00:28:51,00:28:54,You need both to find the truth.
507,00:28:54,00:28:55,DERRICK: Found some crispy-ass denim.
508,00:28:58,00:29:00,WEBSTER: They look like men's jeans.
509,00:29:05,00:29:07,A quarter and two pennies.
510,00:29:07,00:29:09,Dinner's on me.
511,00:29:13,00:29:14,"Dead girl's a blonde, right?"
512,00:29:18,00:29:23,"KATY: That's her. ""Stacia Borsala."" Hungarian passport."
513,00:29:25,00:29:27,Looks like I've got what's left of a blister pack of...
514,00:29:27,00:29:33,"""Zolpidem."" This is so warped, I doubt I'm going to get any prints off of it. The victim had zolpidem in her system."
515,00:29:33,00:29:35,We did it.
516,00:29:35,00:29:36,We ID'd the vic.
517,00:29:36,00:29:38,"I'm sorry, who?"
518,00:29:39,00:29:41,"In your face, CSIs. (laughter)"
519,00:29:41,00:29:44,"Techs and crime cadets, we rule."
520,00:29:44,00:29:45,Hello.
521,00:29:49,00:29:52,Metcalf doesn't have shigella on his hands.
522,00:29:52,00:29:54,"Oh, that's surprising."
523,00:29:54,00:29:55,"A bit of a relief, actually."
524,00:29:55,00:29:57,"(over phone): Yeah, but get this."
525,00:29:57,00:30:04,"The bacteria that infected the squad room, turns out to be the same strain that closed down a day care center in Summerlin last week."
526,00:30:06,00:30:08,Hold on.
527,00:30:08,00:30:10,"A day care center, huh?"
528,00:30:10,00:30:12,"Yep, half a dozen preschoolers."
529,00:30:12,00:30:13,Must've been quite a mess.
530,00:30:15,00:30:17,I don't think that's a coincidence.
531,00:30:17,00:30:21,STOKES: The stuff that got 'em sick came from your pastry box.
532,00:30:21,00:30:24,"What's the deal, bud? Hmm?"
533,00:30:24,00:30:31,"You get tired of the guys in the station stealing your food, so you thought you'd lace a few of your goodies with some shigella, teach 'em a lesson? No."
534,00:30:31,00:30:34,"Yes, the guys steal my food, although those lowlifes would never admit it."
535,00:30:34,00:30:38,"But, look, I would never..."
536,00:30:38,00:30:40,Wh-What's shi-wha?
537,00:30:40,00:30:41,"Shigella-- it's a bacteria, man."
538,00:30:41,00:30:43,"Come on, now. Don't make this any harder on yourself."
539,00:30:43,00:30:46,What'd you do? Did you get the sample from your kid's day care center?
540,00:30:46,00:30:48,"I don't know where the pastries came from, all right?"
541,00:30:48,00:30:50,"I stopped eating sugary snacks, remember?"
542,00:30:50,00:30:53,"Oh, and this isn't my kid's, it's my-my girlfriend's kid."
543,00:30:53,00:30:55,"My-My ex-girlfriend, we just broke up."
544,00:30:55,00:30:57,But I got nothing against the kid.
545,00:30:57,00:30:58,"You know, it's a good drawing, he's talented."
546,00:30:58,00:31:01,Was it a nasty break-up?
547,00:31:01,00:31:03,Is there a pretty kind?
548,00:31:03,00:31:06,Where can I find her?
549,00:31:06,00:31:15,"STOKES: So in revenge for breaking up with you, you decide to give Sergeant Barclay some delicious, homemade baked goods tainted with your child's shigella."
550,00:31:15,00:31:19,"What did you do, save a diarrhea diaper and lace some in with the icing?"
551,00:31:19,00:31:26,"No. Well, what you didn't know was that Sarge had just gone on a little post-break-up diet."
552,00:31:26,00:31:30,Too bad for the cops who stole his food.
553,00:31:30,00:31:32,Your prints were on it.
554,00:31:32,00:31:37,It was a gift. I left it for Barky as a peace offering.
555,00:31:37,00:31:41,Without telling him? The worst you can do is have me reprimanded for bad hygiene.
556,00:31:41,00:31:43,You can't prove malicious intent.
557,00:31:43,00:31:45,That will be up to the D.A.
558,00:31:45,00:31:50,"You caused a disruption at a police station, which could've cost lives."
559,00:31:50,00:31:52,You're looking at a class-B felony.
560,00:31:52,00:31:55,"Would it help if I said I was really, really sorry?"
561,00:32:00,00:32:05,"WILLOWS: I have to say I'm impressed with the initiative. I mean, this case had kind of fallen off the radar."
562,00:32:05,00:32:07,What made you follow up on it?
563,00:32:07,00:32:09,It was...
564,00:32:09,00:32:11,"you know, for the children."
565,00:32:11,00:32:12,"No, really, why?"
566,00:32:12,00:32:14,SIMMS: I have sex stains right here.
567,00:32:16,00:32:17,Anything usable?
568,00:32:17,00:32:18,Maybe.
569,00:32:18,00:32:20,I'm going to try magnetic bead separation.
570,00:32:20,00:32:23,It works best for getting results from inhibited surfaces.
571,00:32:23,00:32:30,"If the inhibited surface is a negative, then it needs a strong positive to draw it out."
572,00:32:30,00:32:37,"Yeah, it also needs an outside agent to activate the... attraction."
573,00:32:37,00:32:41,Couldn't the outside agent contaminate the entire process?
574,00:32:41,00:32:43,"No, it's not strong enough."
575,00:32:43,00:32:47,"In fact, it's really only there to get things started."
576,00:32:47,00:32:48,Sounds like a delicate process.
577,00:32:48,00:32:53,"Hmm, it is. One that requires a lot of patience."
578,00:32:53,00:32:57,"It's worth it, because..."
579,00:32:57,00:33:03,"once the two are bound together, everything else is left behind."
580,00:33:05,00:33:07,Okay.
581,00:33:07,00:33:10,Let me know how it turns out.
582,00:33:11,00:33:12,(sighs)
583,00:33:16,00:33:20,"Hey! I know what you're doing, and I know why you're doing it."
584,00:33:20,00:33:21,You're trying to ruin my date with Wendy.
585,00:33:22,00:33:23,"Well, it's not gonna happen."
586,00:33:23,00:33:24,I followed protocol.
587,00:33:24,00:33:31,"I asked you if it was cool, and you said ""yes."" Henry, I understand you're having a bad day, but I really don't see how I factor into any of it. Oh, fine, then I'll spell it out for you."
588,00:33:31,00:33:36,"First, you monkeyed with my GCMS, and when that didn't work, you took it to the next level."
589,00:33:36,00:33:37,"But that didn't work, either."
590,00:33:37,00:33:39,Our date is still on.
591,00:33:39,00:33:40,I hired a limo.
592,00:33:40,00:33:42,That's kind of flashy for a first date.
593,00:33:42,00:33:45,"Stay out of my lab and stay out of my life, or else."
594,00:33:45,00:33:47,"Or else what? Back off, man."
595,00:33:47,00:33:49,I'm a toxicologist.
596,00:33:49,00:33:53,"I know every odorless, colorless, vomit-inducing liquid known to man."
597,00:33:53,00:33:56,You think about that the next time you eat lunch.
598,00:34:05,00:34:10,"SIMMS: When the metal beads are added to a sample of the stain from the jeans, the DNA actually binds to sites on the metal."
599,00:34:10,00:34:15,"And then in the magnetic field, the beads with the DNA are separated from the rest of the soup."
600,00:34:15,00:34:23,"Now, this particular sample came back as a mixture, so we just subtract out the victim's profile."
601,00:34:23,00:34:25,And we get...
602,00:34:27,00:34:30,An unknown male. All we've got to do is match it to a tenant in the building.
603,00:34:30,00:34:33,You just made denim speak for the dead.
604,00:34:35,00:34:43,BRASS: I'm sure you'll all be willing to give us a DNA sample to assist in our investigation. There's a bunch of other people whose apartments burned up.
605,00:34:43,00:34:45,Why are we the only ones here?
606,00:34:45,00:34:46,"You just got lucky, I guess."
607,00:34:46,00:34:52,"Fine, just show me the cup to pee in or take my blood or whatever, but I gotta be at my job in 20 minutes, so can we get this done?"
608,00:34:52,00:34:54,That's the attitude. Let's go. All right.
609,00:34:57,00:35:01,"Hey, uh, look, giving DNA to cops... uh..."
610,00:35:01,00:35:06,"The way I see it, that's an invasion of my privacy, so I'm going to decline."
611,00:35:06,00:35:07,"You know, just on principle."
612,00:35:07,00:35:09,"Sure, I respect your rights."
613,00:35:09,00:35:11,What's your name? Melvin Dodge.
614,00:35:11,00:35:13,Melvin Dodge.
615,00:35:13,00:35:15,Apartment 3C.
616,00:35:15,00:35:18,"I just have a few things to follow up on, so why don't we have a chat?"
617,00:35:18,00:35:19,Just you and me.
618,00:35:19,00:35:22,"Okay, okay."
619,00:35:22,00:35:26,"According to the landlord, you moved in three days before the fire."
620,00:35:26,00:35:27,"Boy, that's a tough break."
621,00:35:27,00:35:29,Has the town been treating you any better since?
622,00:35:29,00:35:32,"Yeah, I got a job dealing craps over at the Palermo."
623,00:35:32,00:35:34,"They let me go, though."
624,00:35:34,00:35:35,Layoffs. There is a recession going on.
625,00:35:35,00:35:38,Maybe that's not the best time to move.
626,00:35:38,00:35:41,"Three days before the fire, that's barely enough time to unpack."
627,00:35:41,00:35:45,"Yeah, I was totally living out of boxes. Boxes?"
628,00:35:45,00:35:47,You know what I hate about boxes?
629,00:35:47,00:35:50,The stuff they put in them-- the peanuts-- they get everywhere.
630,00:35:50,00:35:51,I learned something about them.
631,00:35:52,00:35:53,"You know, they're not made out of Styrofoam."
632,00:35:53,00:35:56,"To be friendly to the environment, they're made out of cornstarch."
633,00:35:56,00:36:01,"They keep things from getting crushed, and also, keeps a dead girl from going up in flames."
634,00:36:01,00:36:04,"Look, I can get your DNA in about ten seconds."
635,00:36:04,00:36:09,"Tell me what happened right now, and maybe we can knock the charge down to involuntary manslaughter."
636,00:36:11,00:36:13,That's a break for you.
637,00:36:16,00:36:18,I didn't know she was going to die.
638,00:36:18,00:36:19,I met her at Haze.
639,00:36:19,00:36:21,"She was new in town, too."
640,00:36:21,00:36:22,"She didn't know anybody, either."
641,00:36:22,00:36:25,We started drinking. A lot.
642,00:36:25,00:36:27,She got flirty. She asked me if I had any drugs.
643,00:36:28,00:36:31,I told her I had zolpidem back at my place.
644,00:36:31,00:36:35,She starts talking about all the dirty things we can do if we popped a couple.
645,00:36:35,00:36:38,"15 minutes later, she's doing things to me I've only seen online."
646,00:36:38,00:36:42,Then I woke up the next morning...
647,00:36:42,00:36:44,Babe?
648,00:36:44,00:36:45,"And there she was. Hey, come on."
649,00:36:45,00:36:47,"Hey, wake up. Dead."
650,00:36:47,00:36:49,I don't know what happened.
651,00:36:49,00:36:51,She said that she had done it before.
652,00:36:51,00:36:54,I guess I just wasn't thinking straight.
653,00:36:54,00:37:00,"So you put her body in one of your boxes, figured you'd throw it in a Dumpster later?"
654,00:37:00,00:37:02,Was that the plan?
655,00:37:02,00:37:04,I guess so.
656,00:37:04,00:37:10,"But then, I got home that night and I saw that the whole place was going up in flames."
657,00:37:10,00:37:16,The fireman came up and he told me that my apartment had been completely destroyed.
658,00:37:16,00:37:19,I kind of felt like I got lucky again.
659,00:37:19,00:37:20,How do you feel now?
660,00:37:23,00:37:25,Let's do some writing.
661,00:37:27,00:37:30,This guy's life is totally over.
662,00:37:30,00:37:34,How do you deal with this day after day?
663,00:37:34,00:37:37,It's good work when you know you're on the right side.
664,00:37:44,00:37:46,Captain Brass?
665,00:37:46,00:37:50,I just want to say that I think it's awesome the way you've pulled your life back together.
666,00:37:50,00:37:53,Did you get into a program?
667,00:37:54,00:37:55,Who are you?
668,00:37:57,00:37:59,And what's he been telling you?
669,00:38:15,00:38:17,What?
670,00:38:18,00:38:20,"Oh, come on..."
671,00:38:22,00:38:23,"Oh, no way."
672,00:38:23,00:38:26,This isn't funny!
673,00:38:29,00:38:31,What the...?!
674,00:38:31,00:38:34,(grunting)
675,00:38:34,00:38:37,(exclaims)
676,00:38:37,00:38:39,(whimpers): Help. My face...
677,00:38:41,00:38:42,Help.
678,00:38:42,00:38:43,(banging)
679,00:38:43,00:38:45,Lab tech down! Aah!
680,00:38:48,00:38:49,"Wait, is that acetone?"
681,00:38:49,00:38:50,Ah...
682,00:38:50,00:38:54,"It is the best way to dissolve cyanoacrylate, Henry."
683,00:38:54,00:38:56,Yeah-- ah!
684,00:38:56,00:38:57,That's toxic.
685,00:38:57,00:39:03,"Well, not so much, if you keep your mouth closed and cover your eyes with that."
686,00:39:03,00:39:07,"Okay. Lucky for you, I was feeling better and decided to come to work today."
687,00:39:07,00:39:09,There's no telling how long you could've been stuck here.
688,00:39:10,00:39:21,"Obviously, someone has not been adhering to lab policy against pranks, which is strange because we're usually such a cohesive group."
689,00:39:21,00:39:27,"Please stop. I think it's a terrible injustice, because you..."
690,00:39:27,00:39:28,(groans)
691,00:39:28,00:39:32,...are the glue that holds this whole place together.
692,00:39:34,00:39:36,Let's see.
693,00:39:36,00:39:43,"Mm-hmm. Looks like someone shimmed the lock, then applied contact adhesive to the interior surfaces of your locker."
694,00:39:44,00:39:46,"Yeah, well, I have a very good idea who."
695,00:39:47,00:39:49,"Stick it to him, Henry."
696,00:39:54,00:40:00,"Hey. I saw you and Henry in the hall before... Look, I haven't been messing with Henry."
697,00:40:00,00:40:03,"I'm not trying to spoil your date, and I hope that you guys have a very nice life together."
698,00:40:03,00:40:06,I really wasn't trying to blame you for anything.
699,00:40:06,00:40:09,I was just checking in.
700,00:40:11,00:40:13,Why are your hands in your pockets?
701,00:40:13,00:40:18,"Because I'm socially awkward, and it gives me a sense of security."
702,00:40:26,00:40:33,"You know, after Henry accused me, I began to suspect that someone was trying to pin their practical jokes on me."
703,00:40:33,00:40:43,"So I mixed up a little something called ""detection spray"" and I put it all over the surfaces that I felt that Henry would be most vulnerable to pranks, including his locker."
704,00:40:43,00:40:51,"It's essentially a ninhydrin solution, which goes on clear, then reacts with the amino salts in perspiration, leaving a stain on anyone who touches it."
705,00:40:51,00:40:57,"And the more that the perp tries to wash it off, the more the stain spreads."
706,00:40:57,00:40:59,That's really fascinating. I should go.
707,00:40:59,00:41:00,It can last up to five days.
708,00:41:00,00:41:03,You may want to wear a dress with pockets tonight.
709,00:41:13,00:41:15,I'm not proud of this.
710,00:41:15,00:41:22,"Then why did you do it? Because, originally, I really wanted to go out with Henry."
711,00:41:22,00:41:25,Because he's everything that I know I should be looking for.
712,00:41:25,00:41:33,"He's adorable and charming and funny and sweet and nice to me... Okay, I get it."
713,00:41:33,00:41:39,"He's peachy. But then, I realized that what I'm supposed to want..."
714,00:41:39,00:41:42,isn't what I do want.
715,00:41:43,00:41:44,So...
716,00:41:44,00:41:51,"basically, I did the mature thing and I tortured the poor guy with practical jokes all day, thinking that it might make him cancel the date."
717,00:41:51,00:41:54,That does sound like something I'd do.
718,00:41:54,00:41:59,"All right, Hodges, Henry tells me that you reprogrammed the GCMS."
719,00:41:59,00:42:02,And glued my face to my locker and poked my hose.
720,00:42:02,00:42:05,"WILLOWS: Whatever. If this is true, you're looking at a formal reprimand and days off. Did you do it?"
721,00:42:05,00:42:07,SIMMS: Can I just say something?
722,00:42:08,00:42:10,I am so sorry...
723,00:42:10,00:42:12,That you didn't stop me earlier.
724,00:42:12,00:42:17,"You see, Wendy suspected what I was up to, and she was urging me to come clean."
725,00:42:17,00:42:20,"I swear, it'll never happen again."
726,00:42:20,00:42:21,Mea culpa.
727,00:42:22,00:42:24,Can you forgive me?
728,00:42:26,00:42:28,This is going to go on your permanent record.
729,00:42:28,00:42:31,You got your confession-- happy?
730,00:42:31,00:42:32,Hmm.
731,00:42:32,00:42:35,Nobody likes a snitch.
732,00:42:35,00:42:36,(whimpers)
733,00:42:38,00:42:40,(Hodges clears throat)
734,00:42:43,00:42:47,"Henry, I am so, so sorry."
735,00:42:47,00:42:48,I guess this means our date's off?
736,00:42:48,00:42:51,"Oh, yeah."
737,00:42:51,00:42:55,I guess I need some time for my face to heal!
738,00:42:56,00:42:58,Can I get a rain check?
739,00:43:04,00:43:05,Mmm!
740,00:43:11,00:43:13,It's never going to happen.
