0,00:00:14,00:00:17,"Wow, I love it already."
1,00:00:18,00:00:22,I can't believe we're doing this. Is that the lockbox?
2,00:00:22,00:00:24,Broker gave me the combination.
3,00:00:24,00:00:26,He's doing a walk-through in Seven Hills.
4,00:00:27,00:00:30,Owners are out.
5,00:00:41,00:00:44,Wow.
6,00:00:44,00:00:46,Wait till you see the master.
7,00:00:54,00:00:56,"Oh, my God."
8,00:00:56,00:00:58,This is gorgeous.
9,00:00:59,00:01:01,Amazing.
10,00:01:04,00:01:06,What?
11,00:01:06,00:01:08,Want to snoop around?
12,00:01:20,00:01:21,Hey.
13,00:01:23,00:01:25,What do you think?
14,00:01:25,00:01:26,"I don't know, yeah. It's nice?"
15,00:01:26,00:01:28,Looks good.
16,00:01:28,00:01:29,Cut it out.
17,00:01:29,00:01:31,"No, seriously, I think I hear a car."
18,00:01:31,00:01:32,"Will you relax? No, really."
19,00:01:32,00:01:34,You're paranoid.
20,00:01:37,00:01:39,(laughs)
21,00:01:39,00:01:41,"Oh, my God."
22,00:01:41,00:01:42,I could get used to this place.
23,00:01:42,00:01:43,I bet you could.
24,00:01:43,00:01:44,I could.
25,00:01:45,00:01:46,You're an animal.
26,00:01:46,00:01:48,The backyard is the best part of the house.
27,00:01:48,00:01:49,Really? Is there a Jacuzzi?
28,00:01:54,00:01:57,"Oh, my God."
29,00:01:57,00:02:00,Looks like something out of a magazine.
30,00:02:26,00:02:28,Cal and Monica Newman.
31,00:02:28,00:02:31,"Owners of the house. My guess, second marriage."
32,00:02:31,00:02:32,'Cause she's a babe and he's...
33,00:02:32,00:02:34,"He's, uh..."
34,00:02:34,00:02:35,got a good sense of humor.
35,00:02:44,00:02:49,.380 auto caliber.
36,00:02:54,00:02:56,"GRISSOM: Gunshot, right temple."
37,00:02:56,00:02:59,"Women don't usually shoot themselves in the head do they, Catherine?"
38,00:02:59,00:03:03,"Well, gunshots do a number on your face so typically women prefer pills."
39,00:03:04,00:03:06,"BRASS: So what are we calling this, murder, suicide, what?"
40,00:03:06,00:03:09,Is the husband around?
41,00:03:09,00:03:10,No.
42,00:03:10,00:03:15,"Well, do the math: Dead female spouse plus missing husband..."
43,00:03:15,00:03:17,equals murder.
44,00:03:53,00:03:54,"Okay, Warrick, hit it."
45,00:03:54,00:03:58,(beeping)
46,00:04:00,00:04:03,"White female, multiple bruising..."
47,00:04:03,00:04:06,Bullet hole to the temple doesn't help.
48,00:04:06,00:04:09,.380 auto on the side.
49,00:04:09,00:04:13,"Yeah, somebody manhandled her pretty good before they killed her."
50,00:04:33,00:04:35,Reminds me of my daughter.
51,00:04:35,00:04:37,"She used throw butts out the window, too."
52,00:04:37,00:04:40,The Newmans have kids?
53,00:04:40,00:04:43,"Akid. Son, 15, Max Newman."
54,00:04:43,00:04:45,He's MIA like the father.
55,00:04:45,00:04:49,The secretary said he went out for lunch and never came back.
56,00:04:49,00:04:51,I checked the garage-- three cars.
57,00:04:51,00:04:54,None of the hoods are hot.
58,00:04:54,00:04:56,We're missing something.
59,00:04:56,00:04:58,Grissom. Mr. Grissom.
60,00:04:58,00:05:01,Where would I find Mr. Grissom?
61,00:05:02,00:05:03,"Great, great. Thank you very much. Mr. Grissom?"
62,00:05:03,00:05:06,"Hi, I'm Augie Heitz."
63,00:05:06,00:05:07,This is my listing.
64,00:05:08,00:05:09,"Someone died, I know."
65,00:05:09,00:05:11,It's a terrible thing.
66,00:05:11,00:05:14,But we got people knocking down awnings stomping through the flower beds.
67,00:05:14,00:05:17,How am I supposed to sell this house?
68,00:05:17,00:05:18,You're not.
69,00:05:18,00:05:20,It's a crime scene.
70,00:05:20,00:05:23,"Mr. Heitz, you're Mr. Newman's broker."
71,00:05:23,00:05:25,Have you seen your client lately?
72,00:05:25,00:05:27,"What, you kidding?"
73,00:05:27,00:05:30,"I mean, this is actually the beauty of the service I provide."
74,00:05:30,00:05:32,My clients never have to see me.
75,00:05:32,00:05:35,They don't even have to be home when I show their house.
76,00:05:35,00:05:36,Do you always give out the combination to your lockboxes?
77,00:05:37,00:05:38,It's illegal.
78,00:05:38,00:05:40,It's a hot market.
79,00:05:40,00:05:42,Um...
80,00:05:42,00:05:43,"You know, I had a fish on the line."
81,00:05:43,00:05:46,Potential bidding war.
82,00:05:46,00:05:47,Look... (clears throat)
83,00:05:47,00:05:51,I only give out the combination to people that I really trust.
84,00:05:55,00:05:56,"All right, look, I read rooms for a living."
85,00:05:57,00:05:59,That closet was tossed. The carpet lit up.
86,00:05:59,00:06:01,So I'm going to ask you again.
87,00:06:01,00:06:03,What were you doing in there besides copulating?
88,00:06:05,00:06:07,It was my idea.
89,00:06:07,00:06:11,"Right. Well, we found this laptop on the vanity still on."
90,00:06:11,00:06:13,"You didn't play with it, too, did you?"
91,00:06:18,00:06:20,"Hey, Warrick."
92,00:06:20,00:06:21,Check this out.
93,00:06:24,00:06:26,"It's a little thin for blood, isn't it?"
94,00:06:26,00:06:28,Yeah.
95,00:06:31,00:06:34,What do you...?
96,00:06:34,00:06:37,Tastes like sugar water.
97,00:06:37,00:06:38,Erythrosine.
98,00:06:38,00:06:40,Red dye number three.
99,00:06:40,00:06:43,Hummingbirds do love the color red.
100,00:06:43,00:06:46,You've been watching way too much Discovery Channel.
101,00:06:46,00:06:48,This guy needs a girl.
102,00:06:49,00:06:51,I'm going to check out the cabana.
103,00:06:51,00:06:52,No visible footprints.
104,00:06:52,00:06:54,Doesn't mean someone wasn't out here.
105,00:06:55,00:06:56,Grab the LS.
106,00:06:56,00:06:58,Yeah.
107,00:07:00,00:07:01,Hey. Sara.
108,00:07:03,00:07:05,I am so sorry.
109,00:07:05,00:07:08,I paged you two hours ago.
110,00:07:08,00:07:09,"Right. Uh, it's my day off."
111,00:07:10,00:07:11,I was up in Pahrump at some vineyard.
112,00:07:12,00:07:13,"You told me to get a life, remember?"
113,00:07:13,00:07:14,Did I?
114,00:07:17,00:07:18,"I'm sorry, but I needed you."
115,00:07:19,00:07:21,Dispatch called in a 419 at Tuscadero High School.
116,00:07:21,00:07:22,You're on your own.
117,00:07:22,00:07:24,On my own?
118,00:07:24,00:07:27,Solo.
119,00:07:31,00:07:33,See you around.
120,00:07:34,00:07:36,Solo?
121,00:07:38,00:07:42,So does this mean when I come in on my day off I get to work solo?
122,00:07:42,00:07:44,Process.
123,00:07:51,00:07:54,Whoa.
124,00:07:54,00:07:58,I got what looks like two sets of prints.
125,00:08:00,00:08:04,Ballpark in a size ten from the house.
126,00:08:04,00:08:07,And what looks like a...
127,00:08:07,00:08:13,"size 12, possibly from the pool."
128,00:08:13,00:08:16,"There were definitely two guys here, Griss."
129,00:08:16,00:08:19,Now we just need to figure out if one of them was Mr. Newman.
130,00:08:19,00:08:20,"Hey, fellas."
131,00:08:20,00:08:24,Looks like the husband pulled a Clark Kent and left all his clothes behind.
132,00:08:24,00:08:26,Couldn't have gone far.
133,00:08:26,00:08:29,"I got his wallet, credit card and keys."
134,00:08:31,00:08:32,You hear that?
135,00:08:32,00:08:33,What is that?
136,00:08:33,00:08:35,"Oh, yeah, it's the pool."
137,00:08:35,00:08:36,It's been doing it all night.
138,00:08:36,00:08:38,Sounds like it's clogged.
139,00:08:38,00:08:40,Did someone check this pool?
140,00:08:40,00:08:44,First officer said it was clear.
141,00:08:44,00:08:46,Does that pool look clear to you?
142,00:08:47,00:08:49,Uh... no.
143,00:08:51,00:08:54,One of you guys is going in.
144,00:09:03,00:09:05,(clears throat)
145,00:09:05,00:09:06,I'll go in the pool.
146,00:09:44,00:09:46,"Oh, man!"
147,00:09:46,00:09:48,Male D.B.
148,00:09:55,00:09:56,You have dinner yet?
149,00:09:56,00:09:58,Yeah. Why?
150,00:09:58,00:10:01,You might be seeing it again.
151,00:10:04,00:10:06,Mandy Kirk.
152,00:10:06,00:10:07,Seventeen.
153,00:10:07,00:10:08,Seventeen.
154,00:10:08,00:10:09,Senior.
155,00:10:09,00:10:11,Janitor found her.
156,00:10:11,00:10:13,"Hi, David. Hey."
157,00:10:20,00:10:22,Eviscerated.
158,00:10:22,00:10:23,Maybe a wild animal.
159,00:10:23,00:10:26,They picked up a mountain lion last week in Henderson.
160,00:10:26,00:10:28,Suburbs are encroaching on the hinterlands.
161,00:10:28,00:10:31,We'll know more after the autopsy.
162,00:10:31,00:10:35,It's a cheerleader.
163,00:10:35,00:10:37,She had to have good lungs.
164,00:10:37,00:10:40,How come nobody heard her scream?
165,00:10:49,00:10:53,"Didn't have to do much of a ""Y."" Attack did it for me."
166,00:10:53,00:10:54,Died of exsanguination.
167,00:10:54,00:10:55,Bled out.
168,00:10:55,00:10:58,Trauma to her internal organs.
169,00:10:58,00:11:01,"Spleen, liver, heart they all sustained multiple mastications."
170,00:11:01,00:11:03,Hmm.
171,00:11:03,00:11:04,You able to isolate the species?
172,00:11:04,00:11:07,From the tooth mark on her left ninth rib.
173,00:11:11,00:11:12,Dog maybe?
174,00:11:13,00:11:15,Teeth marks are too small for a mountain cat.
175,00:11:15,00:11:16,They're human.
176,00:11:16,00:11:19,You're lying.
177,00:11:22,00:11:27,You can see the bridgework on this impression of a premolar and an adjoining molar.
178,00:11:27,00:11:31,Can you tell how old the attacker is?
179,00:11:31,00:11:35,"Well, I can't give you the exact age but wisdom teeth erupt between 16 and 30."
180,00:11:35,00:11:38,And there's no evidence of a wisdom molar on this impression.
181,00:11:38,00:11:39,Thanks.
182,00:11:42,00:11:43,"Oh, one more thing."
183,00:11:43,00:11:47,I found an infection in the mucus overlying the large intestine.
184,00:11:47,00:11:50,This girl suffered from the E-coli bacteria.
185,00:11:50,00:11:52,E-coli?
186,00:11:52,00:11:53,Unsanitary conditions?
187,00:11:53,00:11:55,Or a bad burger.
188,00:11:55,00:12:00,So whoever did this to her also has E-coli.
189,00:12:00,00:12:01,"Oh, yeah."
190,00:12:01,00:12:04,"Spiked temp, vomiting, lower GI problems, the works."
191,00:12:04,00:12:07,Smoking gun.
192,00:12:46,00:12:49,"I mean, I don't get it."
193,00:12:49,00:12:54,She's not even slated to work she comes in on her day off and she gets to work solo.
194,00:12:54,00:12:57,You still harping on the solo thing?
195,00:12:57,00:13:00,You know every time you work with me you learn something.
196,00:13:00,00:13:03,(chuckles)
197,00:13:03,00:13:05,Is that right? Yes.
198,00:13:05,00:13:07,I live here. Why can't I go in?
199,00:13:07,00:13:09,I want to see my father.
200,00:13:09,00:13:12,"I'm Cal's ex-wife, Jeri Newman and this is our son Max."
201,00:13:12,00:13:14,We have the right to an answer.
202,00:13:14,00:13:16,And we have a right to protect the crime scene.
203,00:13:16,00:13:18,What's going on?
204,00:13:18,00:13:21,I can't tell you anything until I get all the details.
205,00:13:21,00:13:22,I'm sorry.
206,00:13:22,00:13:23,Catherine?
207,00:13:27,00:13:32,We need someone to identify the body.
208,00:13:32,00:13:33,Ms. Newman.
209,00:13:33,00:13:35,"Would you come with me, please?"
210,00:13:35,00:13:37,What about me?
211,00:13:37,00:13:38,"Uh, no, honey."
212,00:13:38,00:13:40,You stay right here.
213,00:13:43,00:13:45,No skin separation.
214,00:13:45,00:13:46,Minimal gaseous buildup.
215,00:13:46,00:13:48,This guy's been in here under 12 hours.
216,00:13:48,00:13:51,"According to his office, he left work at 1:00."
217,00:13:51,00:13:52,It's about right.
218,00:13:58,00:14:00,"What is that, some kind of filter?"
219,00:14:00,00:14:02,It's an anti-vortex filter.
220,00:14:03,00:14:05,"Hey, I'm from Jersey, we swim at the shore."
221,00:14:06,00:14:10,It's designed to keep his hand out of that pipe.
222,00:14:10,00:14:12,But it's missing a few screws.
223,00:14:14,00:14:18,"Ms. Newman, is this your ex-husband?"
224,00:14:20,00:14:21,It's Cal.
225,00:14:35,00:14:36,Virtual tour.
226,00:14:36,00:14:37,"Right on, Archie."
227,00:14:37,00:14:41,Before and after photos of the crime scene.
228,00:14:41,00:14:43,"(imitating Elvis Presley): Thank you, thank you very much."
229,00:14:43,00:14:47,It was on the hard drive of the computer you got at the crime scene.
230,00:14:47,00:14:50,Looks like a Peter Croft sculpture.
231,00:14:50,00:14:52,You know your art. You a collector?
232,00:14:52,00:14:53,What? On my salary?
233,00:14:53,00:14:56,Guggenheim's as close as I get to something like that.
234,00:14:57,00:14:58,"Oh, I haven't been yet."
235,00:14:58,00:14:59,Really?
236,00:14:59,00:15:02,"Well, if you want a tour, I know a docent."
237,00:15:02,00:15:04,A docent.
238,00:15:04,00:15:05,"So, you think that's legit?"
239,00:15:06,00:15:08,"House like this, probably not a knock-off."
240,00:15:09,00:15:10,You'd be surprised.
241,00:15:10,00:15:12,"The rich go cheap to stay rich, know what I mean?"
242,00:15:12,00:15:14,Yeah. Let me show you the after photos.
243,00:15:14,00:15:16,Please.
244,00:15:16,00:15:18,Same spot.
245,00:15:18,00:15:20,"And, uh, what happened to the sculpture?"
246,00:15:20,00:15:22,Good question.
247,00:15:22,00:15:24,You saying somebody lifted it?
248,00:15:24,00:15:26,"Well, they don't call them open houses for nothing."
249,00:15:26,00:15:29,"Put your house on the market your privacy's up for grabs, too."
250,00:15:29,00:15:34,The Newmans unlocked their door to anybody with Internet access.
251,00:15:38,00:15:39,Soccer bunnies?
252,00:15:39,00:15:41,What are soccer bunnies?
253,00:15:41,00:15:43,"Well, each cheerleader is assigned a soccer player."
254,00:15:43,00:15:44,She's his bunny.
255,00:15:44,00:15:49,Gives him gifts the night before the big game places his wake-up call.
256,00:15:49,00:15:50,Sounds sexual.
257,00:15:50,00:15:53,"Yeah, that's what I asked the principal but he said no."
258,00:15:53,00:15:55,"He said that, uh it's all good, clean fun."
259,00:15:55,00:16:00,"Gifts are inspirational videos like, uh,Rocky and wake-up calls are pep talks, nothing more."
260,00:16:00,00:16:04,"Yeah, well, I'm not sure the principal's up to speed on teenagers' sexual habits."
261,00:16:04,00:16:07,"Yeah, well, victim Mandy was soccer bunny to a Chuck Darwell."
262,00:16:08,00:16:14,And when I called him on his cell this morning he said that he hooked up with Mandy after every game except last night.
263,00:16:14,00:16:16,Said he hadn't seen her last night.
264,00:16:16,00:16:18,He in class? Hospital.
265,00:16:18,00:16:20,Got rushed there two minutes ago.
266,00:16:24,00:16:26,I bet I know why.
267,00:16:31,00:16:32,ROBBINS: No surprise here.
268,00:16:32,00:16:33,He drowned.
269,00:16:33,00:16:37,We found his right hand caught in a pool filter.
270,00:16:37,00:16:40,"Lack of bruising, no bleeding wounds."
271,00:16:41,00:16:45,Indicates his circulatory system had stopped.
272,00:16:45,00:16:47,This was postmortem.
273,00:16:53,00:16:57,Any significance to the marks on his chest?
274,00:16:57,00:16:58,"Uh, don't know. Not a rash."
275,00:16:58,00:17:00,Some kind of abrasion.
276,00:17:00,00:17:03,Maybe even a friction burn.
277,00:17:03,00:17:04,Definitely peri-mortem.
278,00:17:04,00:17:10,X-rays reveal several broken ribs and he's got a bruise on his forehead.
279,00:17:10,00:17:12,He could have taken a bad fall.
280,00:17:12,00:17:14,Or he could have been beaten.
281,00:17:14,00:17:16,Maybe.
282,00:17:16,00:17:17,How about the new wife?
283,00:17:19,00:17:24,No physical findings for sexual assault though I did send a kit to DNA.
284,00:17:24,00:17:27,Looks like cause of death was a single gunshot to the head.
285,00:17:27,00:17:29,I'll know more later.
286,00:17:29,00:17:31,You always tell me that.
287,00:17:31,00:17:32,"Yes, I do."
288,00:17:32,00:17:35,Depth of bruising gives us a timeline.
289,00:17:35,00:17:41,"Apparent thumbprint on her neck came first the, uh, prints on her hands second."
290,00:17:41,00:17:43,Major impression on top.
291,00:17:43,00:17:48,It's some kind of recoil bruise on her palm.
292,00:17:49,00:17:51,She didn't shoot herself.
293,00:17:51,00:17:52,(screaming and a gunshot)
294,00:17:53,00:17:55,She had help.
295,00:17:56,00:18:00,"Of course, no house is complete without a pool."
296,00:18:02,00:18:04,Why live in Vegas if you don't have a pool?
297,00:18:06,00:18:10,"Mm, water's warm."
298,00:18:10,00:18:14,You want to come by and take a dip?
299,00:18:14,00:18:15,Quite the saleswoman.
300,00:18:15,00:18:20,"Come on, take a..."
301,00:18:20,00:18:23,"It's got to be a fantasy of yours, huh?"
302,00:18:23,00:18:25,"Huh, double feature."
303,00:18:26,00:18:29,You know you want this.
304,00:18:29,00:18:31,STOKES: Blam.
305,00:18:32,00:18:33,You can say that again.
306,00:18:33,00:18:34,Blam.
307,00:18:34,00:18:36,"Down, boys."
308,00:18:39,00:18:43,"I probably should even be saying this, but, uh..."
309,00:18:43,00:18:50,sex is on my mind all the time.
310,00:18:50,00:18:53,"Hey, Archie, freeze it."
311,00:18:53,00:18:55,"And, uh..."
312,00:18:55,00:18:56,Who's that in the background?
313,00:18:56,00:18:57,STOKES: Hmm?
314,00:18:57,00:19:01,"Oh, that guy in the mirror. Good."
315,00:19:01,00:19:03,"Archie, help us out."
316,00:19:03,00:19:05,"Yup, I got him."
317,00:19:05,00:19:06,STOKES: Nice.
318,00:19:10,00:19:12,BRASS: Hey this is the broker.
319,00:19:12,00:19:14,I just did a background check on that guy.
320,00:19:14,00:19:17,Half a dozen robberies in the houses he has listed.
321,00:19:17,00:19:19,"Art, antiques, stuff like that."
322,00:19:19,00:19:22,Like the Peter Croft sculpture.
323,00:19:22,00:19:23,Exactly.
324,00:19:23,00:19:28,STOKES: Looks like Augie was helping himself to a little bit more than the artwork.
325,00:19:30,00:19:31,"SIDLE: I understand, Mr. Darwell."
326,00:19:31,00:19:33,Have your son's wisdom teeth come in yet?
327,00:19:33,00:19:34,What?
328,00:19:35,00:19:38,"Whoever killed Amanda Kirk ingested her organs, Mr. Darwell. Left teeth marks."
329,00:19:38,00:19:40,Excuse me.
330,00:19:40,00:19:42,"Hi, uh, Chuck, I'm with the crime lab."
331,00:19:42,00:19:44,I'm going to ask you to show me your back teeth.
332,00:19:44,00:19:47,Give us an odontological impression.
333,00:19:48,00:19:50,"I didn't see Mandy last night, I swear."
334,00:19:50,00:19:53,DARWELL: You have no legal right to question or to touch my son.
335,00:19:53,00:19:54,I want you out of here.
336,00:19:54,00:19:56,Now.
337,00:19:56,00:19:57,Is that stomach contents?
338,00:19:57,00:19:59,"That's right, officer."
339,00:20:01,00:20:03,Anything he throw up no longer belongs to him.
340,00:20:03,00:20:04,"PD, public domain."
341,00:20:05,00:20:07,It's going to tell us everything we need to know.
342,00:20:07,00:20:09,"Look, anyone could have lifted that Peter Croft."
343,00:20:09,00:20:11,I thought this was about murder.
344,00:20:11,00:20:12,"WILLOWS: Oh, it is."
345,00:20:12,00:20:13,(cell phone rings)
346,00:20:13,00:20:14,Excuse me.
347,00:20:14,00:20:16,Yeah?
348,00:20:16,00:20:17,"Hey, yeah..."
349,00:20:17,00:20:18,"Hey, can I call you back?"
350,00:20:19,00:20:21,"Okay, then."
351,00:20:21,00:20:22,Bye-bye.
352,00:20:22,00:20:24,"I'm sorry, where were we?"
353,00:20:24,00:20:25,The tape.
354,00:20:25,00:20:29,"It wasn't anybody's face on that tape, it was your face."
355,00:20:29,00:20:31,I recorded their house for the virtual tour.
356,00:20:31,00:20:33,That's what I do to sell houses.
357,00:20:33,00:20:37,Selling house as a front for porno a little blackmail on the side.
358,00:20:37,00:20:38,What are you talking about?
359,00:20:38,00:20:39,I have done nothing wrong.
360,00:20:39,00:20:41,"Oh, you're innocent in all this?"
361,00:20:41,00:20:45,I admit to having lust in my heart.
362,00:20:45,00:20:47,Lust doesn't live in your heart.
363,00:20:49,00:20:51,I'm going to need that DNA sample.
364,00:20:51,00:20:53,"Well, my DNA is your DNA."
365,00:20:53,00:20:54,Great.
366,00:20:54,00:21:00,"Look, for what it's worth I can tell you at least one guy other than her husband that saw Monica in the buff on a weekly basis."
367,00:21:00,00:21:02,"Say, ""ah."" Ah."
368,00:21:03,00:21:05,"BROWN: You must get a lot of ass on a job like this, huh?"
369,00:21:05,00:21:07,"I'm the pool guy, it's one of the perks of the job."
370,00:21:07,00:21:10,One minute I'm scooping leaves the next I'm staring at...
371,00:21:10,00:21:11,"Yeah, I get it."
372,00:21:12,00:21:16,The last time you were there did you happen to see anything out of the ordinary?
373,00:21:17,00:21:18,What? You mean sexual?
374,00:21:18,00:21:19,Maybe.
375,00:21:19,00:21:21,No.
376,00:21:21,00:21:22,"But, uh..."
377,00:21:22,00:21:23,Newman had a temper.
378,00:21:23,00:21:26,He and his kid Max were always going at it.
379,00:21:26,00:21:28,"What are these, huh?"
380,00:21:28,00:21:29,Where did you get these?!
381,00:21:29,00:21:34,I thought the old man was going to beat his ass but... Newman just screamed some more and took off.
382,00:21:34,00:21:37,You mind if I take a look in your cab?
383,00:21:37,00:21:38,Sure.
384,00:21:57,00:21:59,"Well, that's a coincidence."
385,00:21:59,00:22:03,Newman's anti-vortex filter was missing three screws.
386,00:22:03,00:22:04,"I can explain, okay?"
387,00:22:04,00:22:08,I remove them screws from the filter so I'd have an excuse to go back.
388,00:22:09,00:22:10,"Oh, you mean, like, a ""leave-behind""?"
389,00:22:10,00:22:12,"Yeah, I figured the more I was around..."
390,00:22:12,00:22:13,The more she'd want you.
391,00:22:13,00:22:14,"Oh, yeah."
392,00:22:14,00:22:17,"Well, the lab wants more of you, too."
393,00:22:17,00:22:21,We're going to need your fingerprints and a DNA sample.
394,00:22:21,00:22:23,"Take whatever you want, I've got nothing to hide."
395,00:22:34,00:22:36,GRISSOM: Anything from the pool?
396,00:22:36,00:22:39,"Some hairs, I may have found a filling."
397,00:22:41,00:22:44,"Tributlyltin oxide, aluminum sulfate quaternary ammonium."
398,00:22:44,00:22:48,Chemicals in the vic's lungs match the chemicals in the pool water.
399,00:22:48,00:22:50,Anything from his head wound?
400,00:22:50,00:22:51,Trace matches the side of the pool.
401,00:22:51,00:22:54,No surprises.
402,00:22:56,00:22:58,Mildew.
403,00:22:58,00:23:00,Hmm?
404,00:23:00,00:23:01,Aureobasidium pullulans.
405,00:23:01,00:23:05,One of the very few fungi that can withstand the desert temperature.
406,00:23:05,00:23:07,Gives us possible transfer.
407,00:23:08,00:23:11,Exactly. and here's the basic chemistry of the transfer.
408,00:23:11,00:23:21,GRISSOM: Add sugar water spoiled from the heat mix in some human biofilm you got yourself an all-you-can-eat mildew buffet.
409,00:23:21,00:23:23,Cal Newman wore size tens.
410,00:23:23,00:23:25,So assuming our killer wore the size 12...
411,00:23:25,00:23:29,He may have transferred mildew from the pool to the house.
412,00:23:29,00:23:33,"Normally I don't like to speak ill of the dead but, uh, Mr. Newman's sperm had company."
413,00:23:33,00:23:34,Bad company.
414,00:23:34,00:23:36,Look at D7.
415,00:23:36,00:23:37,Three alleles.
416,00:23:37,00:23:40,Genetics only gives you one from each parent.
417,00:23:40,00:23:43,Which can only mean one thing-- Menage d'allele.
418,00:23:43,00:23:45,Shewascheating on her husband.
419,00:23:45,00:23:46,What about stutter?
420,00:23:46,00:23:48,Percentage is too high.
421,00:23:48,00:23:51,We're looking at a minor and a major sample.
422,00:23:51,00:23:52,Minor donor?
423,00:23:52,00:23:53,The husband.
424,00:23:53,00:23:54,Major donor?
425,00:23:54,00:23:55,Pool man.
426,00:23:55,00:23:56,Nope.
427,00:23:56,00:23:57,The broker?
428,00:23:58,00:23:58,Ibid.
429,00:23:58,00:24:01,Major donor is still unaccounted for.
430,00:24:08,00:24:10,BROWN: How's it coming?
431,00:24:10,00:24:12,STOKES: Good. I'm almost there. Hang on.
432,00:24:12,00:24:14,Sometime this year.
433,00:24:17,00:24:20,"Okay, I think that's the angle."
434,00:24:20,00:24:22,"All right, where do I stand?"
435,00:24:22,00:24:24,Back up.
436,00:24:24,00:24:25,Keep going.
437,00:24:25,00:24:27,Keep going. Big steps?
438,00:24:27,00:24:28,Little steps?
439,00:24:28,00:24:29,Big. Keep going.
440,00:24:29,00:24:30,Keep going.
441,00:24:30,00:24:32,"I go any further, I'll be in the closet."
442,00:24:32,00:24:34,"Well, go in the closet."
443,00:24:37,00:24:39,"Oh, you got to be kidding me."
444,00:24:39,00:24:40,What?
445,00:24:40,00:24:43,How's this?
446,00:24:43,00:24:45,What the hell is that?
447,00:24:45,00:24:48,(scoffs)
448,00:24:49,00:24:51,(clattering)
449,00:24:53,00:24:56,"These slime will do anything to sell a house, huh?"
450,00:24:56,00:24:58,"JOHNSON: Sometimes, reflections beget reflections."
451,00:24:59,00:25:04,I figured if I could get a glimpse of the Augie cutout maybe I could get a glimpse of the cameraman.
452,00:25:05,00:25:06,Check out the lamp.
453,00:25:23,00:25:24,"Her stepson, Max."
454,00:25:24,00:25:28,Did you get any DNA off the cigarette butts?
455,00:25:28,00:25:30,"Yeah, we did."
456,00:25:30,00:25:35,"So, let's get Greg to compare the reference sample and see if we found our major donor."
457,00:25:51,00:25:54,SANDERS: Driving someone else's porcelain bus?
458,00:25:54,00:25:57,Suspect's dinner from last night.
459,00:25:57,00:25:59,The coroner left this in your mail slot.
460,00:25:59,00:26:01,Can you read it for me?
461,00:26:04,00:26:06,"What's this look like, Greg?"
462,00:26:06,00:26:07,"Uh, Caesar salad."
463,00:26:07,00:26:12,"Oh, and Pele used an interesting dressing."
464,00:26:12,00:26:13,PCP.
465,00:26:13,00:26:16,Angel dust. Hallucinogen.
466,00:26:16,00:26:17,"Well, it acts like one."
467,00:26:17,00:26:22,But PCP's such a powerful drug it's in a class all its own: Disassociative anesthetic.
468,00:26:22,00:26:24,Brain disassociates from the body.
469,00:26:24,00:26:26,"Yeah, after it takes you through the paces."
470,00:26:26,00:26:27,How many milligrams?
471,00:26:27,00:26:29,Uh... 20.
472,00:26:29,00:26:31,Dude's dose was off the charts.
473,00:26:31,00:26:33,I'm surprised he's still alive.
474,00:26:33,00:26:34,Yeah.
475,00:26:34,00:26:37,Too bad everybody didn't make it.
476,00:26:44,00:26:47,Tell me this is raw chicken skin.
477,00:26:49,00:26:54,"Well, it's raw... and it's definitely skin."
478,00:27:00,00:27:02,My son was nowhere near that pool.
479,00:27:02,00:27:03,He was at...
480,00:27:03,00:27:04,Red Rock Canyon. A field trip.
481,00:27:04,00:27:06,"Oh, I'm getting that."
482,00:27:06,00:27:08,What I'm not getting is this.
483,00:27:10,00:27:12,"Oh, now, this is disgusting."
484,00:27:13,00:27:17,"Look, whatever Cal wanted to do behind closed doors, that was his business."
485,00:27:17,00:27:19,This is not for my eyes or for his eyes.
486,00:27:20,00:27:23,"This is not the first time, is it, Max?"
487,00:27:31,00:27:33,Can I plead the Fifth or something?
488,00:27:33,00:27:39,Max we found two sperm donors on the sample from your stepmother.
489,00:27:39,00:27:41,Your father's and yours.
490,00:27:41,00:27:43,Now I know why you were spending all that time at your father's.
491,00:27:43,00:27:45,"Mom, look, I..."
492,00:27:48,00:27:49,Mom...
493,00:27:50,00:27:51,I don't want to hear a word from you.
494,00:27:51,00:27:55,"Well, let me lay it out for you."
495,00:28:02,00:28:04,So you must've thought you won the lottery.
496,00:28:04,00:28:08,And the only thing standing between you and the winning ticket was your father.
497,00:28:09,00:28:10,(yelling)
498,00:28:18,00:28:20,"What's your shoe size, Max?"
499,00:28:20,00:28:22,Twelve.
500,00:28:23,00:28:24,This can't be happening.
501,00:28:25,00:28:26,"Yes, it's happening."
502,00:28:26,00:28:27,"Okay, this is a fling."
503,00:28:27,00:28:28,"Okay, it's not real."
504,00:28:28,00:28:30,You're confused. You're a kid.
505,00:28:30,00:28:34,I killed my father for you.
506,00:28:34,00:28:37,That's not possible.
507,00:28:37,00:28:39,How come?
508,00:28:39,00:28:41,Because I can't swim.
509,00:28:43,00:28:45,He's telling the truth.
510,00:28:45,00:28:50,When Max was a child he had this terrible pool accident.
511,00:28:50,00:28:53,He nearly drowned.
512,00:29:04,00:29:06,"We need that report, ASAP."
513,00:29:08,00:29:10,Your temperature is spiking.
514,00:29:10,00:29:16,"Of course, you didn't know Mandy had E. coli when you... ate her, did you?"
515,00:29:16,00:29:18,"No, no, I would never do that."
516,00:29:18,00:29:20,You would on PCP.
517,00:29:21,00:29:25,"Normal brain, neurons send a message synapses blink on and off."
518,00:29:25,00:29:29,"On PCP, synapses never stop firing."
519,00:29:29,00:29:32,Like your entire brain is on constant DSL.
520,00:29:34,00:29:37,LOCKWOOD: You and Mandy were on the soccer field.
521,00:29:37,00:29:38,You were cranked up.
522,00:29:38,00:29:40,Do you remember anything?
523,00:29:46,00:29:48,Yeah.
524,00:29:49,00:29:52,But I don't remember killing her. I swear to God.
525,00:29:52,00:29:54,Lieutenant Lockwood's going to arrest you.
526,00:29:54,00:29:57,We'll assign you an advocate.
527,00:29:59,00:30:02,"GRISSOM: So, how does a kid who can't swim drown his father?"
528,00:30:02,00:30:03,The kid didn't do it.
529,00:30:03,00:30:06,"Look, we found the father's blood on the underside of the pool ledge."
530,00:30:06,00:30:09,And his body at the bottom of the pool with abrasions on his chest.
531,00:30:10,00:30:12,So there was a struggle in the water.
532,00:30:13,00:30:14,With someone who can swim.
533,00:30:15,00:30:15,Right.
534,00:30:21,00:30:24,You cannot be serious!
535,00:30:24,00:30:27,"Hey, John McEnroe, where's the game?"
536,00:30:27,00:30:33,"All the prints are accounted for by people who had a reason to be in the Newman house all the way down to the vortex cover,Warrick."
537,00:30:33,00:30:34,Prints came back to the pool boy.
538,00:30:34,00:30:43,"Yeah. Yeah, so all I've got is an errant blond hair a tooth filling and some detritus from the bottom of the pool."
539,00:30:43,00:30:46,"All right, now, don't get your panties in a bunch."
540,00:30:46,00:30:51,"Uh, so we got the blond hair, the tooth filling..."
541,00:30:51,00:30:52,"That's it, huh?"
542,00:30:52,00:30:53,Yeah.
543,00:30:53,00:30:58,"I mean, I did identify some Neoprene and it was white."
544,00:30:58,00:30:59,White Neoprene.
545,00:30:59,00:31:00,Yeah.
546,00:31:00,00:31:02,Like in a wet suit Neoprene?
547,00:31:03,00:31:05,Was the vic a diver?
548,00:31:05,00:31:06,Not that I know of.
549,00:31:06,00:31:09,The son can't even swim.
550,00:31:09,00:31:10,Let's think about that.
551,00:31:10,00:31:15,Who wears a white wet suit in a pool?
552,00:31:15,00:31:17,Scuba diver.
553,00:31:17,00:31:18,Or a professional.
554,00:31:18,00:31:21,A professional.
555,00:31:21,00:31:24,"No, I mean like a hired gun professional."
556,00:31:24,00:31:27,Yeah.
557,00:31:35,00:31:36,Tooth hurt?
558,00:31:38,00:31:46,"You might, uh, need your filling which we found at the bottom of the Newmans' pool."
559,00:31:46,00:31:50,BRASS: We also found your fingerprints and your hair.
560,00:31:50,00:31:54,"Look, I'm sure you'll find me all over the house."
561,00:31:54,00:31:55,I wanted to buy it.
562,00:31:55,00:31:57,I was everywhere.
563,00:31:57,00:32:00,"Well, you made sure you were everywhere, too, didn't you?"
564,00:32:00,00:32:04,I wanted to thoroughly inspect the property.
565,00:32:04,00:32:05,"Caveat emptor,right?"
566,00:32:05,00:32:08,Orcaveat venditor.
567,00:32:08,00:32:09,Let the seller beware.
568,00:32:10,00:32:12,Your prints came back military.
569,00:32:12,00:32:13,Navy Seal.
570,00:32:13,00:32:15,Ex-Navy Seal.
571,00:32:15,00:32:16,"Oh, yeah, that's right."
572,00:32:16,00:32:19,You rang the bell.
573,00:32:22,00:32:26,You had the physical tools for the training but not the character.
574,00:32:26,00:32:32,And if you had anything more than a filling and a piece of Neoprene we wouldn't be here.
575,00:32:32,00:32:33,Berglund.
576,00:32:33,00:32:36,"That's a Scandinavian name, isn't it?"
577,00:32:37,00:32:39,That's what my parents tell me.
578,00:33:02,00:33:05,"Hey, heard you nailed soccer boy for the murder."
579,00:33:05,00:33:06,Not exactly.
580,00:33:06,00:33:09,No match on the bite plate.
581,00:33:09,00:33:11,"Well, maybe there was someone else with them."
582,00:33:11,00:33:14,Someone getting sicker by the minute.
583,00:33:20,00:33:22,Greg.
584,00:33:22,00:33:23,Yeah?
585,00:33:23,00:33:25,I need you to take off your shoes and socks.
586,00:33:25,00:33:33,"See, now we're getting into this whole strip forensics thing and I'm not so sure I can hang with that even if you are my boss."
587,00:33:33,00:33:36,"Your mother's maiden name is Hojem, correct?"
588,00:33:36,00:33:37,Hojem is Norwegian?
589,00:33:37,00:33:39,Yeah.
590,00:33:39,00:33:43,"And you know, my grandfather got tossed from Norway for getting my grandmother pregnant before they got married."
591,00:33:43,00:33:54,"To this day, he still tells me ""Som man reder sa ligger man."" One must lie in the bed one has made."
592,00:33:54,00:33:56,That's true.
593,00:33:56,00:33:57,"Right foot first, please."
594,00:34:00,00:34:01,"Now, you're sure you want me to do this?"
595,00:34:01,00:34:03,Things could get loud in here.
596,00:34:08,00:34:09,Left foot.
597,00:34:12,00:34:15,So you want to tell me why we're doing this?
598,00:34:17,00:34:19,It's an experiment.
599,00:34:20,00:34:21,Put these on.
600,00:34:21,00:34:23,Come see me in six hours.
601,00:34:34,00:34:35,"Nicole Exmoor, 18."
602,00:34:35,00:34:37,School nurse said she couldn't stop throwing up.
603,00:34:37,00:34:39,Teacher found her passed out in the locker room.
604,00:34:39,00:34:40,She have an explanation?
605,00:34:40,00:34:43,Said that she ate something that didn't agree with her.
606,00:34:44,00:34:46,"Nicole, do you know what E. coli is?"
607,00:34:46,00:34:49,Your friend Mandy was infected with it.
608,00:34:49,00:34:52,We think we know how you got it.
609,00:34:52,00:34:53,We can test your blood for PCP...
610,00:34:53,00:34:56,"(sniffling): Chuck brought the weed, not me."
611,00:34:56,00:34:59,This guy told him it was a really great high.
612,00:35:01,00:35:04,These photographs are...
613,00:35:04,00:35:07,of Mandy's ribs.
614,00:35:07,00:35:09,We believe these are your teeth marks.
615,00:35:13,00:35:20,Ms. Sidle can make an impression of your teeth or you can help yourself and explain what happened.
616,00:35:24,00:35:27,When Jack and I went to the field...
617,00:35:27,00:35:30,we were hooking up behind Mandy's back.
618,00:35:33,00:35:38,"She showed up, she was like, ""He's my player."" Mandy!"
619,00:35:39,00:35:44,I don't know what happened. I started to feel weird like my blood was surging through me.
620,00:35:47,00:35:50,It didn't make any sense.
621,00:35:53,00:35:56,I think I wanted to be her.
622,00:36:04,00:36:06,It felt...
623,00:36:06,00:36:09,It felt like somebody else walked over and did it.
624,00:36:09,00:36:12,Like she was split from my body.
625,00:36:17,00:36:21,It's called psychological detachment.
626,00:36:21,00:36:23,It's a function of PCP.
627,00:36:43,00:36:46,It's like out of a really bad dream.
628,00:36:46,00:36:49,"Nicole, I was at Mandy's autopsy."
629,00:36:49,00:36:52,It was not a dream.
630,00:37:03,00:37:08,I'm placing you under arrest for the murder of Amanda Kirk.
631,00:37:11,00:37:13,(sobbing)
632,00:37:17,00:37:19,What's going to happen to me?
633,00:37:21,00:37:23,That's up to the D.A.
634,00:37:32,00:37:39,"Hey, Cyrus, next time somebody says experimenting with drugs is harmless remind me of this."
635,00:37:46,00:37:49,What did you do to me?
636,00:37:49,00:37:51,You had a reaction.
637,00:37:51,00:37:54,I'm Hazmat meat.
638,00:37:54,00:37:56,"Quarantine, here I come."
639,00:37:57,00:38:01,"Your right foot, I swabbed with a placebo, regular tap water."
640,00:38:01,00:38:03,"Yeah, well, I'm not worried about the right foot."
641,00:38:03,00:38:06,Left foot... eumycotic dermatitis.
642,00:38:06,00:38:07,"Oh, great."
643,00:38:07,00:38:09,It's probably fatal.
644,00:38:09,00:38:11,It's a mildew-induced skin rash.
645,00:38:11,00:38:15,You infected me with mildew?
646,00:38:19,00:38:20,Here. Hydrocortisone.
647,00:38:20,00:38:23,"Follow the directions, clear it right up."
648,00:38:25,00:38:29,It's called Aureobasidium pullulans.
649,00:38:29,00:38:32,Is that supposed to mean something to me?
650,00:38:34,00:38:35,It may.
651,00:38:35,00:38:38,This is a warrant.
652,00:38:39,00:38:42,To see my feet?
653,00:38:42,00:38:44,"Yes, both of them."
654,00:38:44,00:38:46,"Take off your shoes and socks, please."
655,00:38:47,00:38:50,Aureobasidium pullulans is a mildew.
656,00:38:50,00:38:52,We found it around the Newmans' pool.
657,00:38:52,00:39:01,It induces rashes in people of Scandinavian descent-- and it does so in a predictable progression which provides us with a valuable timeline.
658,00:39:06,00:39:07,You have the rash.
659,00:39:12,00:39:14,And size 12 feet.
660,00:39:22,00:39:25,Let me tell you how you did this.
661,00:39:41,00:39:43,(gasping)
662,00:40:14,00:40:16,And then you went upstairs.
663,00:40:16,00:40:17,Cal?
664,00:40:17,00:40:19,(gunshot)
665,00:40:20,00:40:25,You're still going to have to convince a jury that I killed two strangers for no reason.
666,00:40:29,00:40:32,"You ever been to the theater, Peter?"
667,00:40:32,00:40:35,There's a play called Six Degrees of Separation.
668,00:40:35,00:40:40,It's about how all the people in the world are connected to each other by no more than six people.
669,00:40:40,00:40:45,All it takes to connect you to the victims is one degree.
670,00:40:49,00:40:51,Peter Berglund?
671,00:40:52,00:40:55,"No, I don't recall ever having met somebody by that name."
672,00:40:55,00:40:58,"Well, do you recall living in San Diego?"
673,00:40:58,00:41:01,What does that have to do with anything?
674,00:41:01,00:41:02,"Oh, it just might help jog your memory."
675,00:41:02,00:41:04,San Diego's a military town.
676,00:41:04,00:41:06,"Your sister married a guy in the Navy, right?"
677,00:41:06,00:41:08,Did you really bring me in here just for this?
678,00:41:08,00:41:11,"Well, we could go someplace else if you'd like."
679,00:41:11,00:41:14,How about your house?
680,00:41:14,00:41:16,The one you're selling.
681,00:41:16,00:41:18,What's this?
682,00:41:18,00:41:25,"Well, you see, we didn't have enough evidence at this point to get a warrant but you put your house on the Internet."
683,00:41:25,00:41:27,I didn't need a warrant.
684,00:41:27,00:41:32,Gave me complete access via this virtual tour.
685,00:41:32,00:41:35,And all with your permission.
686,00:41:42,00:41:45,That's you... that's Peter Berglund...
687,00:41:46,00:41:47,and that's the Pacific.
688,00:41:48,00:41:49,So what?
689,00:41:49,00:41:51,I know Peter.
690,00:41:51,00:41:53,Yeah.
691,00:41:53,00:41:57,You hired him to kill your ex-husband and his new wife.
692,00:41:57,00:41:59,The picture doesn't prove anything.
693,00:41:59,00:42:03,"No, but it did give me access to Peter's financial information."
694,00:42:06,00:42:10,Loan application. Two signatures-- Peter Berglund and yours.
695,00:42:10,00:42:13,You cosigned for Peter because he couldn't qualify on his own.
696,00:42:13,00:42:15,Payment for the hit.
697,00:42:15,00:42:18,He gets your house you get your ex-husband's money.
698,00:42:18,00:42:21,The thing about murder for hire...
699,00:42:21,00:42:23,there's always a paper trail.
700,00:42:31,00:42:33,Good night.
701,00:42:34,00:42:36,"Good night, Sara."
702,00:42:39,00:42:40,Hey.
703,00:42:42,00:42:45,Nice work on the high school case.
704,00:42:47,00:42:49,"I'm, uh..."
705,00:42:51,00:42:53,...sorry I missed your page.
706,00:42:53,00:42:56,"It's just, um..."
707,00:42:56,00:43:00,"you tell me to get a life and then I get one, and..."
708,00:43:00,00:43:04,then you expect me to be there at a moment's notice.
709,00:43:04,00:43:08,"It's, um, confusing."
