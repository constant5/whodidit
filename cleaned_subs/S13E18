1,00:00:06,00:00:07,Leave me alone!
2,00:00:10,00:00:12,Stay away!
3,00:00:12,00:00:14,(grunts)
4,00:00:14,00:00:16,(filtered breathing)
5,00:00:33,00:00:34,(twig snaps)
6,00:00:38,00:00:39,(loud crunch)
7,00:00:39,00:00:40,(screaming)
8,00:00:40,00:00:42,"(scream fading, echoing)"
9,00:00:42,00:00:46,"(siren wailing in distance, indistinct radio chatter)"
10,00:00:46,00:00:52,"Homeless couple was camped there with the group under the overpass, spotted the body and flagged down a patrol unit."
11,00:00:52,00:00:53,David.
12,00:00:53,00:00:56,"Hey. Well, looks like somebody beat you to the burrito wrap here."
13,00:00:56,00:00:58,"I would've done a better job, though."
14,00:01:00,00:01:01,BRODY: Camouflage.
15,00:01:01,00:01:03,"Says, maybe, military."
16,00:01:03,00:01:06,"Yeah, or army surplus-- you know, camping stuff."
17,00:01:08,00:01:12,STOKES: It reminds me of when I used to go hunting with my old man.
18,00:01:12,00:01:13,I never pegged you as a hunter.
19,00:01:13,00:01:15,Of course I was a hunter.
20,00:01:15,00:01:16,Just never got into the killing part.
21,00:01:19,00:01:23,"Apparently, someone doesn't have the same reverence for life as you do."
22,00:01:23,00:01:25,Massive bruising on the face.
23,00:01:25,00:01:26,He took a real beating.
24,00:01:29,00:01:32,"Yeah, and that looks like some kind of animal bite on his leg."
25,00:01:32,00:01:36,Vital response in the tissue means it happened while he was still alive.
26,00:01:37,00:01:39,A wolf or...
27,00:01:39,00:01:41,"a coyote, some kind of dog."
28,00:01:41,00:01:43,But I think dogs were the least of this guy's worries.
29,00:01:43,00:01:45,Somebody took his hands.
30,00:01:45,00:01:47,"Well, a dog didn't do that."
31,00:01:47,00:01:50,"No wallet, no I.D."
32,00:01:50,00:01:51,"No hands, no fingerprints."
33,00:01:51,00:01:56,"Well, then again, if we're talking about hunting, maybe the killer took the hands as a trophy."
34,00:01:56,00:02:01,"BRODY: Either way, we have no I.D., and we have no idea where this guy came from."
35,00:02:01,00:02:04,We're stumped.
36,00:02:04,00:02:06,"Sorry. I'm just saying, this is gonna be a tough one."
37,00:02:08,00:02:10,"They always are, Super Dave."
38,00:02:10,00:02:12,They always are.
39,00:02:48,00:02:50,RUSSELL: This a traffic camera?
40,00:02:50,00:02:51,On Sunrise Boulevard.
41,00:02:51,00:02:54,"Got a detail of the drainage basin, blew it up."
42,00:02:54,00:02:56,Picked up an image of this guy dumping our victim.
43,00:02:56,00:02:58,RUSSELL: Time code-- 3:36 a.m.
44,00:02:58,00:03:00,It's about five hours ago.
45,00:03:00,00:03:03,"Well, maybe our killer will show his face."
46,00:03:03,00:03:04,"Freeze that, right there."
47,00:03:04,00:03:07,I can enhance it.
48,00:03:07,00:03:10,(beeping)
49,00:03:10,00:03:12,Night vision goggles?
50,00:03:12,00:03:13,That's some serious hardware.
51,00:03:13,00:03:15,Nick thought that our guy was a hunter.
52,00:03:15,00:03:17,Who's hunting humans?
53,00:03:17,00:03:21,Man is the most dangerous game.
54,00:03:30,00:03:34,He has a knee brace. Must have had an old injury.
55,00:03:34,00:03:36,SANDERS: Vonner Sports Motocross.
56,00:03:36,00:03:37,"You know, a lot of this gear is custom-made."
57,00:03:37,00:03:40,Might be able to get an I.D. from the manufacturer.
58,00:03:40,00:03:42,There's something in his little pocket.
59,00:03:42,00:03:44,Looks like a wad of paper.
60,00:03:46,00:03:48,Maybe it's something more.
61,00:03:50,00:03:51,Huh.
62,00:03:54,00:03:55,Paper crane.
63,00:03:55,00:03:57,You think our victim was into origami?
64,00:03:57,00:03:59,Or our killer was trying to leave us a clue.
65,00:03:59,00:04:04,"How about you chase the crane, and I'll get our John Doe to Doc Robbins."
66,00:04:06,00:04:12,"C.O.D.'s exsanguination due to bisection of the right wrist, rupturing the radial and ulnar arteries."
67,00:04:12,00:04:14,The right hand was severed peri-mortem?
68,00:04:14,00:04:16,That's correct.
69,00:04:16,00:04:21,"Well, we assumed both hands were removed postmortem to prevent identification or possibly taken as trophies."
70,00:04:21,00:04:23,"Well, that's the case with the left hand."
71,00:04:23,00:04:25,The injury here is definitely postmortem.
72,00:04:25,00:04:27,"In both instances, the method was crude."
73,00:04:27,00:04:31,"I can't tell you what tool was used, but I sent swabs from the wounds over to Hodges."
74,00:04:31,00:04:33,What about the animal bite on his leg?
75,00:04:33,00:04:34,It was no animal.
76,00:04:34,00:04:36,It was man-made. Come on over here.
77,00:04:39,00:04:43,Perfect symmetry of the punctures was the tell.
78,00:04:46,00:04:48,GREG: A bear trap?
79,00:04:48,00:04:51,"Well, it's consistent with our theory that the killer may be a hunter."
80,00:04:51,00:04:54,I also found this in the postmortem wound.
81,00:04:54,00:04:57,Appears to be some kind of synthetic.
82,00:04:57,00:04:59,Could help us find our primary.
83,00:04:59,00:05:00,I'll get it to Hodges.
84,00:05:00,00:05:02,"Thanks, Doc."
85,00:05:45,00:05:48,(beeping)
86,00:05:48,00:05:49,Mm.
87,00:05:50,00:05:51,Hey. (groans)
88,00:05:51,00:05:53,I see your artist remains anonymous.
89,00:05:53,00:05:54,(sighs): Yeah.
90,00:05:54,00:05:56,I didn't fare much better myself.
91,00:05:56,00:06:01,The green sliver Doc found on the body is a polypropylene blend with green dye.
92,00:06:01,00:06:03,Artificial turf. Indeed.
93,00:06:03,00:06:06,And I didn't find any trace that put us closer to the primary.
94,00:06:06,00:06:09,(sighs) So we both struck out. Mm.
95,00:06:10,00:06:14,"You know, I dated a Japanese girl in college."
96,00:06:14,00:06:17,Washi is the paper traditionally used by the masters.
97,00:06:17,00:06:25,"Tougher than ordinary pulped paper, it's often made from the bark of the gampi tree, or sometimes from the mitsumata shrub... Hodges."
98,00:06:25,00:06:31,"All I'm saying is in origami, sometimes the medium is the message."
99,00:06:31,00:06:34,"As in, that is not proper origami paper."
100,00:06:34,00:06:37,"Our crane may not be speaking to us, but the paper might."
101,00:06:39,00:06:42,"Okay, thanks for the info."
102,00:06:42,00:06:43,Hey.
103,00:06:43,00:06:45,"Hey. Get up there and lay down, boy."
104,00:06:45,00:06:46,"Is it ""bring your dog to work"" day?"
105,00:06:46,00:06:48,We were just coming home from the vet.
106,00:06:48,00:06:52,"I thought I'd bring him up here to see some friends, maybe cheer him up a little bit."
107,00:06:52,00:06:54,(Sam whines) I bet you Sam's bored.
108,00:06:54,00:06:56,Are you kidding me? This dog's living the life.
109,00:06:56,00:07:00,"I treat him like a king. (chuckles): Nick, he used to be a cop; now he's retired."
110,00:07:00,00:07:03,He probably misses the field.
111,00:07:03,00:07:05,"Is she right, Sam?"
112,00:07:05,00:07:07,You bored? You want to do some work? Travaillez?
113,00:07:07,00:07:09,(barking)
114,00:07:09,00:07:10,Told you.
115,00:07:10,00:07:19,"Speaking of getting to work, that custom knee brace that Greg found on our victim-- manufacturer said it was ordered by a Dylan Trigg."
116,00:07:19,00:07:20,Summerlin address.
117,00:07:20,00:07:22,Sounds like we just I.D.'d our John Doe.
118,00:07:22,00:07:26,I'm heading out there now with Crawford to give notification.
119,00:07:26,00:07:29,"We don't envy you that, do we, Sam?"
120,00:07:29,00:07:30,(whines)
121,00:07:30,00:07:32,Mm.
122,00:07:32,00:07:35,(dogs barking in distance)
123,00:07:43,00:07:45,"Yeah, excuse me, sir."
124,00:07:45,00:07:47,"I'm Detective Crawford, this is CSI Brody, LVPD."
125,00:07:47,00:07:49,My crazy neighbor call you guys again?
126,00:07:49,00:07:51,"I'm sorry, I don't understand. My pickup."
127,00:07:51,00:07:53,Guy keeps complaining that I park it on the street.
128,00:07:53,00:07:57,So I park in front of his house-- what's the big deal? It's a public street.
129,00:07:57,00:07:59,"Nobody called about your truck, sir."
130,00:07:59,00:08:01,"Um, does a Dylan Trigg live here?"
131,00:08:01,00:08:04,Yeah. Dylan's my son.
132,00:08:06,00:08:08,What's this about?
133,00:08:08,00:08:11,"Mr. Trigg, when's the last time you saw your son?"
134,00:08:11,00:08:13,Five minutes ago.
135,00:08:13,00:08:16,"Hey, Dylan, can you come out here?"
136,00:08:16,00:08:19,You say your friend's name is Carl Abrams?
137,00:08:19,00:08:22,"Yeah, I loaned Carl some of my motocross gear a couple days ago."
138,00:08:22,00:08:27,"Uh, this is us at the freestyle competition in Laughlin last year."
139,00:08:27,00:08:29,That's where he dinged his knee.
140,00:08:32,00:08:37,You said somebody... killed Carl.
141,00:08:37,00:08:40,"(sighs) I mean, I-I don't understand. What happened?"
142,00:08:40,00:08:42,That's what we're trying to figure out.
143,00:08:42,00:08:44,Did it go down up near Koval Ridge?
144,00:08:44,00:08:46,Why do you ask that?
145,00:08:46,00:08:49,We were supposed to go camping there this weekend.
146,00:08:49,00:08:51,But I bailed at the last minute.
147,00:08:51,00:08:53,And why didn't you go?
148,00:08:53,00:08:55,"There's something about that place, man."
149,00:08:55,00:08:57,Creeps me out.
150,00:08:57,00:09:01,"What about it? There's this whole Hunger Games, Road Warrior vibe up there."
151,00:09:01,00:09:04,All these people waiting for the world to end-- it's kind of scary.
152,00:09:04,00:09:06,Carl loved the place.
153,00:09:06,00:09:07,He camped there by himself.
154,00:09:07,00:09:09,Loved exploring around the old mines.
155,00:09:09,00:09:12,He told me he'd strike it rich one day.
156,00:09:12,00:09:15,Do you know any spots maybe your buddy liked to camp in?
157,00:09:15,00:09:20,"If I was gonna go looking for him, I'd probably look in the areas around those old mines."
158,00:09:20,00:09:22,"Sorry, I-I wish I knew more."
159,00:09:22,00:09:26,"Maybe if... if I had been up there with him, this wouldn't have happened."
160,00:09:39,00:09:42,"Hey, Crawford, you there?"
161,00:09:42,00:09:43,CRAWFORD: Copy.
162,00:09:43,00:09:46,"All right, listen, we're about a mile from Pielstick mine."
163,00:09:46,00:09:49,"We're gonna start our search with the dog over here, okay?"
164,00:09:49,00:09:51,Copy that. We're on the south side of the ridge.
165,00:09:51,00:09:53,Haven't found anything yet.
166,00:09:53,00:09:54,Venez. Let me know.
167,00:09:54,00:09:56,Roger that.
168,00:09:56,00:09:57,"Yeah, let's go, troops."
169,00:09:57,00:09:59,Restez ici.
170,00:09:59,00:10:02,"Très bien. All right, we're gonna find out where Carl Abrams came from."
171,00:10:02,00:10:05,This is a swatch from the victim's shirt.
172,00:10:05,00:10:06,Got it?
173,00:10:06,00:10:07,Trouvez.
174,00:10:09,00:10:10,(barks)
175,00:10:14,00:10:15,(barks)
176,00:10:37,00:10:38,(whimpers)
177,00:10:38,00:10:40,There he is.
178,00:10:41,00:10:43,"Hang on, I think he's got something."
179,00:10:43,00:10:45,Hang on.
180,00:10:45,00:10:46,"What is it, boy? (barking)"
181,00:10:46,00:10:48,(whimpering) Huh? Sam?
182,00:10:48,00:10:49,Arrêtez.
183,00:10:49,00:10:51,Good boy.
184,00:10:51,00:10:52,(barks)
185,00:10:58,00:11:00,It's got a handle.
186,00:11:00,00:11:01,"BRODY: What is this, Lost?"
187,00:11:01,00:11:03,We got some blood right here.
188,00:11:03,00:11:04,(Sam barking)
189,00:11:04,00:11:07,"Sam, allez là-bas. Restez là."
190,00:11:11,00:11:13,(groans)
191,00:11:13,00:11:14,(metal door creaks)
192,00:11:16,00:11:17,BRODY: More blood inside.
193,00:11:17,00:11:19,"Yeah, yeah, here we go."
194,00:11:19,00:11:24,All this blood-- tells me this could be our primary.
195,00:11:24,00:11:25,Ready?
196,00:11:26,00:11:28,"BRODY: Restez ici, Sam."
197,00:11:51,00:11:53,(lights buzzing)
198,00:11:53,00:11:54,(gasps)
199,00:12:00,00:12:02,They're just empty suits.
200,00:12:02,00:12:03,(sighs)
201,00:12:03,00:12:05,Motion sensor lights.
202,00:12:10,00:12:13,Fatigues...
203,00:12:13,00:12:15,night vision goggles.
204,00:12:15,00:12:17,"Well, I've seen this before."
205,00:12:17,00:12:18,I'm gonna call for backup.
206,00:12:18,00:12:20,"Crawford, it's Morgan."
207,00:12:20,00:12:23,We've got something.
208,00:12:23,00:12:24,Crawford?
209,00:12:24,00:12:27,You might want to go topside; I don't think you're gonna get a signal down here.
210,00:12:27,00:12:28,I'll be back.
211,00:12:28,00:12:30,'Kay.
212,00:12:30,00:12:31,Crawford.
213,00:12:31,00:12:32,Come in. It's Morgan.
214,00:12:32,00:12:33,"Crawford, do you copy?"
215,00:12:47,00:12:49,(creaking)
216,00:12:49,00:12:50,(grunts)
217,00:12:55,00:12:57,(door creaks)
218,00:13:22,00:13:23,"Hey, Morgan?"
219,00:13:25,00:13:27,How we doing on that backup?
220,00:13:36,00:13:38,You don't belong here.
221,00:13:44,00:13:46,I'm with the LVPD.
222,00:13:46,00:13:47,I don't care who the hell you are.
223,00:13:47,00:13:48,You're trespassing.
224,00:13:48,00:13:50,And you're making a big mistake.
225,00:13:50,00:13:51,There's a whole lot of cops up there.
226,00:13:51,00:13:53,Gonna be coming through that door any second.
227,00:13:53,00:13:54,"You think I'm stupid, pal?"
228,00:13:54,00:13:56,You think I was born yesterday?
229,00:13:56,00:13:57,Nope.
230,00:13:57,00:14:00,But I think you may die today if you don't put the gun down.
231,00:14:00,00:14:02,(barking)
232,00:14:02,00:14:04,Why the hell are you people here? Why?!
233,00:14:04,00:14:06,"Put that shotgun down, and we'll talk about it."
234,00:14:06,00:14:09,"Otherwise, they're gonna be scraping us both up off the ground."
235,00:14:09,00:14:10,Is that what you want?
236,00:14:10,00:14:11,You're here to arrest me?
237,00:14:11,00:14:13,We want to talk to you.
238,00:14:13,00:14:15,(Sam barking)
239,00:14:24,00:14:27,Guess I should have had them scrape us up off the floor.
240,00:14:28,00:14:30,Better than sitting here like a common criminal.
241,00:14:30,00:14:33,"Well, that part's still to be determined, actually."
242,00:14:33,00:14:34,Who are you?
243,00:14:34,00:14:35,I'm CSI Russell.
244,00:14:35,00:14:37,Care to tell us who you are?
245,00:14:39,00:14:44,"A lot of people are living off the grid nowadays, but y-you've taken it to a whole new level."
246,00:14:44,00:14:46,You-you have no identification.
247,00:14:46,00:14:49,"So far, we've found nothing in your little bunker."
248,00:14:49,00:14:53,"No bank statement, no utility bills, nothing with your name on it."
249,00:14:53,00:14:56,"It's almost like you worked very hard to disappear, haven't you?"
250,00:14:56,00:14:57,Is that a crime?
251,00:14:57,00:14:58,"Well, I'm just wondering why."
252,00:14:58,00:15:01,Why?
253,00:15:01,00:15:03,You had no right to drag me out of my home.
254,00:15:03,00:15:06,Without as much as a word as to why.
255,00:15:06,00:15:08,You know why.
256,00:15:08,00:15:11,I've seen the way you treat trespassers.
257,00:15:11,00:15:13,You're not very hospitable.
258,00:15:13,00:15:15,Is that what happened with Carl Abrams?
259,00:15:15,00:15:16,He trespass?
260,00:15:17,00:15:20,I don't know Carl Abrams.
261,00:15:20,00:15:22,Okay.
262,00:15:22,00:15:24,That's fine if you don't want to cooperate.
263,00:15:24,00:15:28,We'll let your little hole in the ground do the talking.
264,00:15:37,00:15:39,Who does this?
265,00:15:40,00:15:42,(sighs) Someone prepping for doomsday.
266,00:15:42,00:15:46,Re-creating a world they believe will disappear with the coming Armageddon.
267,00:15:46,00:15:48,Tried to make something disappear.
268,00:15:48,00:15:50,Blood.
269,00:15:50,00:15:52,Lots of it.
270,00:15:52,00:15:54,"Astroturf is porous, just like carpet."
271,00:16:00,00:16:02,That's a significant blood pool.
272,00:16:02,00:16:04,The killer severed Carl Abrams' right hand.
273,00:16:04,00:16:05,He bled out.
274,00:16:05,00:16:08,Could've been right here.
275,00:16:12,00:16:14,Doc Robbins found something like this in the victim's wound track.
276,00:16:16,00:16:18,Positive for blood.
277,00:16:18,00:16:20,Carl Abrams died here.
278,00:16:24,00:16:27,Place is lacking a certain survivalist touch.
279,00:16:27,00:16:30,"Yeah, it doesn't really fit our man with no name, does it?"
280,00:16:30,00:16:33,How long do you think the guy's been living down here like this?
281,00:16:33,00:16:39,"Well, he's got a well-stocked pantry, he's got water, electricity."
282,00:16:39,00:16:41,I'd say for a while.
283,00:16:41,00:16:43,"You know, I'd say we're done in this room."
284,00:16:43,00:16:47,"There's no blood, there's no sign of disturbance, there's nothing probative in here."
285,00:16:47,00:16:49,"All right, let's check the rest of the house."
286,00:17:00,00:17:02,"Hey, Fin?"
287,00:17:02,00:17:05,I think I found the master's master bedroom.
288,00:17:11,00:17:13,This decor is more like it.
289,00:17:38,00:17:41,I found his toys.
290,00:17:41,00:17:43,"FINLAY: Sara, you got to see this."
291,00:17:50,00:17:51,This is not good.
292,00:17:51,00:17:53,Mm-mm.
293,00:17:53,00:17:55,Man keeps a room for a little girl in his hunting cave.
294,00:17:55,00:17:57,"Yeah, it gets worse."
295,00:17:57,00:17:59,I don't think he uses the room just for little girls.
296,00:18:02,00:18:04,Women's clothes.
297,00:18:04,00:18:05,"Yeah, and different sizes."
298,00:18:05,00:18:07,Could mean a number of different women.
299,00:18:07,00:18:09,Some of these labels are old.
300,00:18:09,00:18:11,Sutters?
301,00:18:11,00:18:13,That department store's been out of business for years.
302,00:18:18,00:18:21,Origami paper crane.
303,00:18:27,00:18:30,Just like the one I pulled out of Carl Abrams' pocket.
304,00:18:32,00:18:34,Do you think he makes one for each victim?
305,00:18:36,00:18:38,You recognize that?
306,00:18:40,00:18:41,We have your prints all over it.
307,00:18:41,00:18:47,"I'll give you a hint: it's not one of the origami animals we just found in your house, but it looks just like it."
308,00:18:47,00:18:55,This was in Carl Abrams' pocket when we found his body and his blood in your bunker.
309,00:18:55,00:18:57,"I told you, I don't know the guy."
310,00:18:57,00:18:59,You're setting me up. You need a suspect.
311,00:18:59,00:19:02,"And for whatever reason, you've chosen me."
312,00:19:02,00:19:04,"Yeah, actually, you know what? Y-You reached out to us."
313,00:19:04,00:19:06,"Here, take a look at that video."
314,00:19:06,00:19:08,"See, you made the first move, didn't you?"
315,00:19:08,00:19:10,"Look, I know how this works."
316,00:19:10,00:19:11,"Yeah, I'll bet you do."
317,00:19:11,00:19:12,That's it.
318,00:19:12,00:19:13,I've had enough of this pervert.
319,00:19:16,00:19:22,Why don't you tell us about the little girl's room you have set up down there.
320,00:19:22,00:19:24,And all the clothes from all those women.
321,00:19:24,00:19:26,"I mean, how many were there?"
322,00:19:26,00:19:28,You want me to admit to something that I didn't do.
323,00:19:28,00:19:29,Something that I have no knowledge of.
324,00:19:29,00:19:31,"Well, I'm not playing your game!"
325,00:19:31,00:19:36,All I want is to be left in peace. Is that what you told Carl Abrams before you killed him?
326,00:19:36,00:19:37,I don't know Carl.
327,00:19:37,00:19:39,He was camping in your area.
328,00:19:39,00:19:40,What happened?
329,00:19:40,00:19:45,Did he stumble upon your little piece of hell down there?
330,00:19:54,00:19:56,Got signs of sexual activity.
331,00:19:56,00:19:58,Not that I'm surprised.
332,00:19:58,00:19:59,"Well, I'm surprised."
333,00:19:59,00:20:02,There is no blood here.
334,00:20:02,00:20:05,"Well, a sex room isn't the same as a kill room."
335,00:20:05,00:20:07,He takes them somewhere else.
336,00:20:14,00:20:16,(thumping)
337,00:20:18,00:20:19,Did you hear that?
338,00:20:19,00:20:20,Yeah.
339,00:20:20,00:20:23,Sounds like it's coming from behind the wall.
340,00:20:23,00:20:24,Looks like an air vent.
341,00:20:24,00:20:26,(thumping continues)
342,00:20:26,00:20:27,There's no air coming out.
343,00:20:29,00:20:32,"Whatever it is, it's inside the walls."
344,00:20:32,00:20:33,It's moving.
345,00:20:33,00:20:35,It's headed towards the yard.
346,00:20:35,00:20:37,It's trying to get away.
347,00:20:39,00:20:40,Stop. Hold on.
348,00:20:40,00:20:41,"Stop right there! Wait, wait!"
349,00:20:41,00:20:43,(panting)
350,00:20:43,00:20:44,Stop. It's okay.
351,00:20:44,00:20:45,Stop. We're the police.
352,00:20:45,00:20:47,No one's gonna hurt you.
353,00:20:47,00:20:48,"We're here to help you, okay?"
354,00:20:48,00:20:51,What's your name?
355,00:20:51,00:20:52,We're gonna get you out of here.
356,00:20:52,00:20:53,You're safe now.
357,00:20:53,00:20:55,You're okay.
358,00:20:55,00:20:58,You're safe.
359,00:21:46,00:21:50,"We may not know your name, but we're starting to get a pretty good picture of your crimes."
360,00:21:50,00:21:51,We found the girl.
361,00:21:51,00:21:53,One you've been holding captive.
362,00:21:53,00:21:55,The one you kidnapped.
363,00:21:55,00:21:56,And raped.
364,00:21:56,00:22:00,"And probably would've murdered, just like all the others."
365,00:22:00,00:22:02,Remember how we asked you how many women there were?
366,00:22:02,00:22:04,"Well, we've already found one."
367,00:22:04,00:22:06,Rebecca Barnes.
368,00:22:06,00:22:08,Recognize her?
369,00:22:09,00:22:14,"Or have there just been so many, you can't even remember at this point?"
370,00:22:14,00:22:17,Found her dress in your bunker.
371,00:22:17,00:22:21,The DNA on it traces to an unsolved murder in Carson City 11 years ago.
372,00:22:23,00:22:25,Was she your first?
373,00:22:25,00:22:27,Is that why you kept the dress?
374,00:22:27,00:22:29,As a trophy?
375,00:22:29,00:22:31,You people have no idea what you're talking about.
376,00:22:31,00:22:33,Then you tell us!
377,00:22:33,00:22:39,"What drives a man to kidnap, to rape, and to murder?"
378,00:22:39,00:22:41,I wouldn't know.
379,00:22:41,00:22:47,"This woman that you said that I murdered, Rebecca Barnes-- she was my wife."
380,00:22:47,00:22:52,And the girl that you found-- the one you accused me of...
381,00:22:54,00:22:57,Her name...
382,00:22:57,00:22:59,it's Miranda.
383,00:22:59,00:23:01,And that's my little girl.
384,00:23:03,00:23:05,She's all I have left in this world.
385,00:23:24,00:23:27,Just got the file on the Rebecca Barnes homicide from Carson City.
386,00:23:27,00:23:30,Bunker Boy's name is Tommy Barnes.
387,00:23:30,00:23:35,He was the husband and primary suspect in his wife's murder until Carson City cleared him.
388,00:23:35,00:23:36,That explains the attitude.
389,00:23:36,00:23:38,He thought the cops were coming after him again.
390,00:23:38,00:23:40,Says here they never caught the killer?
391,00:23:40,00:23:42,"Yeah, still an open case."
392,00:23:42,00:23:44,Barnes's daughter Miranda was seven years old at the time.
393,00:23:44,00:23:48,"After he was cleared, he told police he was taking his daughter and leaving town."
394,00:23:48,00:23:50,"Then went underground, literally."
395,00:23:50,00:23:54,DNA confirms the only contributors on the women's clothes are his wife and his daughter.
396,00:23:54,00:23:56,Different sizes.
397,00:23:56,00:24:01,"He kept his wife's dresses, then he bought his kid new clothes as she was growing up."
398,00:24:01,00:24:06,"Sad story, but none of that clears him on the murder of Carl Abrams."
399,00:24:06,00:24:08,"No. No, it doesn't."
400,00:24:11,00:24:13,Where's my daughter?
401,00:24:13,00:24:14,I want to see her.
402,00:24:14,00:24:16,She's fine.
403,00:24:16,00:24:19,"She's in the hospital, getting checked out."
404,00:24:19,00:24:21,It's just a...
405,00:24:21,00:24:24,It's a formality.
406,00:24:24,00:24:28,"I'm gonna, uh, take your cuffs off here."
407,00:24:33,00:24:34,Mr. Barnes...
408,00:24:36,00:24:39,...why don't you and I start over again.
409,00:24:39,00:24:41,With an apology.
410,00:24:42,00:24:46,I was just told about Carson City.
411,00:24:46,00:24:49,I can't even begin to know what that was like.
412,00:24:49,00:24:53,"Losing your wife, having the police suspect you like that."
413,00:24:53,00:24:55,For months.
414,00:24:55,00:25:00,"While that animal who killed Rebecca is still out there, free."
415,00:25:03,00:25:05,"I, um..."
416,00:25:05,00:25:07,read the case file.
417,00:25:09,00:25:15,Your daughter Miranda was there when-when your wife was abducted from the mall parking lot.
418,00:25:15,00:25:18,It could have been both of them taken away from me.
419,00:25:18,00:25:20,"Mr. Barnes, I'm so sorry."
420,00:25:24,00:25:26,Thanks.
421,00:25:28,00:25:30,"You know, Rebecca was my high school sweetheart."
422,00:25:33,00:25:35,We had a perfect life.
423,00:25:35,00:25:37,"Nice house, good friends, part of a church."
424,00:25:37,00:25:46,"You never expect to wake up one morning, leave your home, you go to work, the wife does some shopping-- just a normal day."
425,00:25:46,00:25:49,When you get back home...
426,00:25:49,00:25:51,it's all gone.
427,00:25:51,00:25:55,And-and that's when you-you went underground?
428,00:25:55,00:26:02,"Well, in the '50s, before my grandfather donated the land to the state, he built a fallout shelter to protect his family."
429,00:26:02,00:26:05,"And you decided that's how you were gonna protect your family, too."
430,00:26:05,00:26:08,What was left of it.
431,00:26:08,00:26:10,So I built a home in the bunker.
432,00:26:10,00:26:12,I'd take odd jobs in the area.
433,00:26:12,00:26:15,I provided Miranda with everything she needed.
434,00:26:15,00:26:17,"Food, shelter."
435,00:26:17,00:26:19,I even homeschooled her.
436,00:26:19,00:26:23,"Well, that's a great plan when she's seven."
437,00:26:23,00:26:26,What about now when she's 17?
438,00:26:26,00:26:28,Miranda has everything that she needs.
439,00:26:28,00:26:32,You and I both know that's not true.
440,00:26:32,00:26:37,We found evidence of sexual activity in your daughter's bed.
441,00:26:37,00:26:38,Two DNA contributions.
442,00:26:38,00:26:42,"Two men-- one unknown, the other one, our victim, Carl Abrams."
443,00:26:42,00:26:44,You're lying. I know my daughter.
444,00:26:44,00:26:47,You just told me that you took odd jobs.
445,00:26:47,00:26:48,That gets you out of the house.
446,00:26:48,00:26:52,"Your daughter-- she's lonely, she's curious, she ventures out."
447,00:26:52,00:26:55,"No, she would never leave on her own, not without me."
448,00:26:55,00:27:01,"Mr. Barnes, Carl Abrams' semen in your daughter's bed, his blood in your house."
449,00:27:01,00:27:02,"Now, come on."
450,00:27:02,00:27:05,"Look, I know you'd do anything to protect your daughter."
451,00:27:05,00:27:08,"I just told you, I'm not a murderer."
452,00:27:08,00:27:09,Did he break in? Did he threaten Miranda?
453,00:27:09,00:27:11,"You guys are all the same, aren't you?"
454,00:27:11,00:27:13,"Here, Carson City-- it's the same."
455,00:27:15,00:27:17,I'm done talking to you.
456,00:27:21,00:27:23,(door opens)
457,00:27:23,00:27:25,I need to ask you some questions.
458,00:27:25,00:27:27,Miranda.
459,00:27:27,00:27:29,"Yes, I-I do know your name."
460,00:27:29,00:27:33,And I know how you and your dad ended up in that bunker.
461,00:27:33,00:27:40,But what I don't know is what happened to Carl Abrams two nights ago.
462,00:27:40,00:27:42,And I need you to tell me.
463,00:27:42,00:27:44,I can't help you.
464,00:27:44,00:27:46,"Yes, you can."
465,00:27:46,00:27:52,This is a DNA report which tells me that there were two boys in your bed.
466,00:27:54,00:27:56,One of whom was Carl.
467,00:27:56,00:27:57,"No, that's a lie."
468,00:27:57,00:27:59,I've never been with any boys.
469,00:27:59,00:28:01,What happened?
470,00:28:01,00:28:04,Was the other boy jealous of Carl?
471,00:28:04,00:28:06,Did they fight?
472,00:28:06,00:28:08,I know Carl was hurt.
473,00:28:08,00:28:11,He went down into the bunker to you for help.
474,00:28:11,00:28:13,Leave me alone.
475,00:28:13,00:28:18,"Miranda, I remember being so scared of disappointing my dad."
476,00:28:18,00:28:23,"And yet, I was so desperate for other people's attention, I would do anything."
477,00:28:25,00:28:31,"You started sneaking out when your dad was away, and you met Carl."
478,00:28:31,00:28:33,And I'm sure the two of you had a really good time.
479,00:28:33,00:28:35,"And then, you met another boy."
480,00:28:35,00:28:39,"And he was a bad boy, and it was really exciting."
481,00:28:39,00:28:45,And you didn't realize just how dangerous that boy was until it was too late.
482,00:28:45,00:28:49,I know you know what happened to Carl.
483,00:28:49,00:28:55,"And I know that you're scared, and you don't know who you're more scared of-- your-your dad or the other boy."
484,00:28:55,00:28:57,But you don't have to be.
485,00:28:57,00:28:59,You just have to tell me the truth.
486,00:29:03,00:29:05,(sighs) I had her.
487,00:29:05,00:29:11,"She was this close to talking, and then I lost her; she just went right back into being that scared little girl."
488,00:29:11,00:29:12,Where's this leave us?
489,00:29:12,00:29:16,What about that other kid-- the one you think that killed Carl Abrams-- how do we find him?
490,00:29:16,00:29:18,I think Miranda's still the key.
491,00:29:18,00:29:22,"She's a teenage girl who is sneaking out at night, and she's trying to hook up with boys."
492,00:29:22,00:29:25,"So if we find out where she's sneaking off to, we find the kid. Exactly."
493,00:29:25,00:29:29,"So we have to go back into the bunker, and we have to search it again."
494,00:29:29,00:29:32,"We have to look for something, like a diary or-or some clue to her secret life."
495,00:29:32,00:29:33,(cell phone chimes)
496,00:29:33,00:29:35,Like the way you're thinking.
497,00:29:35,00:29:36,Thank you.
498,00:29:36,00:29:37,"Oh, boy."
499,00:29:37,00:29:38,What?
500,00:29:38,00:29:41,I think Dad just grounded us.
501,00:29:43,00:29:46,"CSI Russell, CSI Finlay, Jill McDermott."
502,00:29:46,00:29:48,Tommy Barnes' attorney. Pleasure.
503,00:29:48,00:29:52,CRAWFORD: Ms. McDermott is alleging that we violated her client's Fourth Amendment rights.
504,00:29:52,00:29:54,Illegal search and seizure?
505,00:29:54,00:29:56,You're saying we needed a warrant to get in the bunker?
506,00:29:56,00:29:58,Last time I read the Constitution.
507,00:29:58,00:30:01,CRAWFORD: I was explaining to counsel the exigent circumstances.
508,00:30:01,00:30:04,Your CSIs found blood at the entrance of the bunker.
509,00:30:04,00:30:07,"Yes, not to mention that the bunker is on public land."
510,00:30:07,00:30:10,A little preview of how this is gonna play in court.
511,00:30:10,00:30:13,"One, I don't buy exigent circumstances."
512,00:30:13,00:30:21,"And two, while the Barnes estate generously donated much of its land to the Koval Ridge Reserve, the estate maintains all mineral rights."
513,00:30:21,00:30:25,So everything under the surface is still private property.
514,00:30:25,00:30:28,And any evidence you collected in Mr. Barnes' home gets thrown out.
515,00:30:28,00:30:30,Fruit of the poisonous tree.
516,00:30:30,00:30:38,"I think a judge would be reluctant to let you go digging around those roots again. Of course, if you were to release my client now, I'd take that as a good faith gesture."
517,00:30:38,00:30:42,Might discourage me from filing any civil action against the department.
518,00:30:42,00:30:44,I'm sure you all have a lot to discuss.
519,00:30:44,00:30:45,Have a nice night.
520,00:30:47,00:30:48,I know you wanted to get back in that bunker.
521,00:30:48,00:30:52,Yeah. We need a lead to find out where Miranda goes when she meets the mystery kid.
522,00:30:52,00:30:54,Maybe we don't have to go back in there.
523,00:30:54,00:30:56,I'm gonna call Hodges.
524,00:31:01,00:31:03,(scanner humming)
525,00:31:10,00:31:13,Hey. That crane speaking to you yet?
526,00:31:13,00:31:17,"Whispering. I ran the paper through the VSC, managed to get some detail."
527,00:31:17,00:31:20,Looks like an MRE packaging label.
528,00:31:20,00:31:23,"""Meals-Ready-to-Eat,"" as in military fare."
529,00:31:23,00:31:25,Consistent with the Barnes family lifestyle.
530,00:31:25,00:31:29,"You know, along the bottom, that looks like a barcode."
531,00:31:29,00:31:31,"You know, these days, they encode the shipping destination."
532,00:31:35,00:31:38,(beeping)
533,00:31:40,00:31:56,"""Koval Ridge Supply Store."" Well, it's not much, but if you live out here, it's your one and only stop shop."
534,00:31:56,00:31:59,And it's the only civilization a girl could find for miles.
535,00:31:59,00:32:02,Good a place as any to meet a guy.
536,00:32:02,00:32:03,What? I've done worse.
537,00:32:03,00:32:05,(laughs)
538,00:32:05,00:32:07,(doorbells jingle)
539,00:32:10,00:32:13,STOKES: Whoa.
540,00:32:20,00:32:23,I'm getting a serious feeling of déjà vu here.
541,00:32:23,00:32:25,Yup.
542,00:32:27,00:32:30,Guess now we know where Tommy Barnes got his gear.
543,00:32:30,00:32:33,"Yeah, and maybe where our killer did, too."
544,00:32:40,00:32:41,(door closes)
545,00:32:44,00:32:46,Excuse me.
546,00:32:46,00:32:48,You work here?
547,00:32:48,00:32:51,"No, stocking shelves is my hobby."
548,00:32:51,00:32:53,"Well, we're, uh, we're with the crime lab."
549,00:32:53,00:32:55,We need to talk to you for a second. What's your name?
550,00:32:55,00:32:58,Luke.
551,00:32:58,00:32:59,Luke. Luke what?
552,00:32:59,00:33:01,LUKE: Holland.
553,00:33:01,00:33:03,You ever seen that guy?
554,00:33:03,00:33:05,His friend says he comes in here.
555,00:33:05,00:33:08,No. A lot of people come in here.
556,00:33:08,00:33:10,STOKES: Yeah. I can see that.
557,00:33:10,00:33:12,How about this little girl right here?
558,00:33:12,00:33:13,You ever seen her?
559,00:33:15,00:33:17,No. I've never seen her either. BRODY: Nick.
560,00:33:19,00:33:22,Remember what you said about déjà vu?
561,00:33:24,00:33:25,"Is that your stuff, man?"
562,00:33:27,00:33:28,Call for backup!
563,00:33:32,00:33:34,(engine sputtering)
564,00:33:38,00:33:41,"Going somewhere, Luke? I didn't do nothing."
565,00:33:41,00:33:43,Innocent people don't run from the police.
566,00:33:44,00:33:46,That's Carl Abrams' bike.
567,00:33:46,00:33:48,"Yeah, and I think we just found his killer."
568,00:33:55,00:33:56,"STOKES: We got you, Luke."
569,00:33:56,00:34:00,The blood on the outside of the fatigues was a match to Carl Abrams.
570,00:34:00,00:34:04,And the DNA on the inside is gonna be a match to you.
571,00:34:04,00:34:07,"You killed Carl, and you dumped the body."
572,00:34:07,00:34:09,You're wrong.
573,00:34:09,00:34:13,"Yeah, I got rid of Carl's body, but I didn't kill him."
574,00:34:13,00:34:16,Then who did? Miranda? I don't know who did it.
575,00:34:16,00:34:19,"STOKES: You're gonna have to do a lot better than that, Luke."
576,00:34:19,00:34:20,"Seriously, a lot better."
577,00:34:20,00:34:23,I'm telling you the truth. I swear.
578,00:34:23,00:34:26,"I was with Miranda saying good night, and that's when we heard him."
579,00:34:26,00:34:27,Help me.
580,00:34:27,00:34:29,Carl was hurt. Real bad.
581,00:34:29,00:34:32,It was like out of a horror movie.
582,00:34:32,00:34:35,"His hand was gone, he was bleeding."
583,00:34:35,00:34:38,There was nothing we could do; he died right there in front of us.
584,00:34:38,00:34:42,"I told her I'd take care of it, so I cleaned up."
585,00:34:42,00:34:45,"I cut off Carl's other hand, so no one could identify him."
586,00:34:45,00:34:49,I dumped his body on the edge of town and cleared away his campsite.
587,00:34:49,00:34:51,"Well, that's a pretty good story, I guess."
588,00:34:51,00:34:54,But think I got a better one.
589,00:34:54,00:34:58,It's not really a... a horror movie.
590,00:34:58,00:35:02,It's... more of a tragic romance.
591,00:35:02,00:35:08,"See, I think you killed Carl Abrams because the girl you loved started showering her attention on him, not you."
592,00:35:08,00:35:11,You think I killed Carl over Miranda?
593,00:35:11,00:35:12,STOKES: Come on.
594,00:35:12,00:35:15,We know about the love triangle.
595,00:35:15,00:35:20,We got Carl's DNA in Miranda's bed and an unknown male.
596,00:35:20,00:35:24,"We're not only gonna match the fatigues to you, we're gonna match the sheets."
597,00:35:24,00:35:26,I'm not the one on those sheets.
598,00:35:26,00:35:29,And there's no way...
599,00:35:29,00:35:31,Miranda was with Carl.
600,00:35:31,00:35:33,What are you saying? Miranda's not that kind of girl?
601,00:35:33,00:35:35,"No, Carl's not that kind of guy."
602,00:35:35,00:35:37,The dude's got a boyfriend.
603,00:35:37,00:35:44,We all used to hang out together in the bunker when her dad was away. Guess now I know what those boys were up to when they ran off to her room.
604,00:35:44,00:35:47,You're looking at the wrong jealous boyfriend.
605,00:35:47,00:35:49,Carl Abrams' boyfriend got a name?
606,00:35:50,00:35:52,Dylan Trigg.
607,00:35:52,00:35:54,He and Carl were into motocross and camping.
608,00:35:54,00:35:58,That's how Miranda and I first met them-- camping up on Horizon Peak.
609,00:35:58,00:35:59,Yeah.
610,00:35:59,00:36:02,Carl was my boyfriend.
611,00:36:02,00:36:04,Why didn't you say anything about this before?
612,00:36:04,00:36:07,(sighs) I'm not exactly out.
613,00:36:07,00:36:11,Was he out? Carl didn't give a damn about what anybody thought.
614,00:36:11,00:36:12,STOKES: That include you?
615,00:36:12,00:36:13,Pretty much.
616,00:36:13,00:36:14,Was that a problem?
617,00:36:14,00:36:16,"Yeah, it was a problem."
618,00:36:16,00:36:18,Carl didn't get it.
619,00:36:18,00:36:19,It was so easy for him.
620,00:36:19,00:36:24,"He said that... if I had any guts, I'd tell people the truth."
621,00:36:24,00:36:26,Is that what you two fought about that night?
622,00:36:28,00:36:29,Do I need a lawyer?
623,00:36:29,00:36:31,"I don't know, Dylan."
624,00:36:31,00:36:32,Do you?
625,00:36:35,00:36:38,"Hey, I found motorcycle tracks back up on the ridge."
626,00:36:38,00:36:40,They match the tires on Carl's bike.
627,00:36:40,00:36:43,"So far, Luke Holland's story's holding up."
628,00:36:43,00:36:45,Let's hope it gets us to the crime scene.
629,00:36:45,00:36:47,I got two sets of shoe impressions.
630,00:36:47,00:36:53,"One looks like work boots, and the other has a tread like the shoes we found on Carl Abrams."
631,00:36:53,00:36:55,It's long strides.
632,00:36:55,00:36:57,Carl was running.
633,00:36:57,00:36:59,Looks like...
634,00:36:59,00:37:05,"he slowed down around here, stopped, backed up."
635,00:37:06,00:37:09,SANDERS: Right into a bear trap.
636,00:37:10,00:37:12,(screaming)
637,00:37:12,00:37:15,"It's got blood on it, just like Doc Robbins suspected."
638,00:37:15,00:37:18,Mechanism's rusted.
639,00:37:18,00:37:20,Must've broken when it snapped on Carl's leg.
640,00:37:20,00:37:21,That's why he was able to get away.
641,00:37:21,00:37:24,SIDLE: He didn't get very far.
642,00:37:24,00:37:25,I just found Carl's right hand.
643,00:37:28,00:37:29,Buckshot in the wound.
644,00:37:29,00:37:32,Confirms it was a shotgun.
645,00:37:32,00:37:34,Still...
646,00:37:34,00:37:37,there's blood and tissue under his fingernails.
647,00:37:37,00:37:39,We lucked out. Carl got a piece of his killer.
648,00:37:39,00:37:40,DYLAN: You guys don't understand.
649,00:37:40,00:37:42,I loved Carl.
650,00:37:42,00:37:44,I would never hurt him.
651,00:37:44,00:37:46,BRODY: I'm sure you didn't mean to.
652,00:37:46,00:37:48,You were the one who told us where Carl was camping.
653,00:37:48,00:37:50,You sent us to Koval Ridge.
654,00:37:50,00:37:53,"Clearly, you wanted us to discover the truth."
655,00:37:53,00:37:55,I'm sure you feel terrible about what happened.
656,00:37:55,00:37:57,You know there's only one way to make this right.
657,00:38:02,00:38:04,What the hell is going on here?
658,00:38:10,00:38:13,I think I want that lawyer now.
659,00:38:13,00:38:16,"RUSSELL: Mr. Trigg, this is your son Dylan's confession."
660,00:38:16,00:38:24,"He told us that you admitted to assaulting and hunting down Carl Abrams, shooting him and leaving him for dead."
661,00:38:24,00:38:27,My son is lying; I never told him any such thing.
662,00:38:27,00:38:30,Dylan's head is so filled with lies because that...
663,00:38:30,00:38:33,"kid, Carl Abrams, messed with him."
664,00:38:33,00:38:37,Screwed him up so he doesn't know who he is or what the truth is anymore.
665,00:38:37,00:38:42,"You're right, your son is confused-- because he's had to live a lie."
666,00:38:42,00:38:43,Thanks to you.
667,00:38:43,00:38:45,Think you just made my case in court.
668,00:38:45,00:38:48,This confession isn't worth the paper it's written on.
669,00:38:48,00:38:50,"Well, that's why we depend on evidence."
670,00:38:50,00:38:55,This is a tire track found on an access road near the scene of the crime.
671,00:38:55,00:38:57,Matches your truck.
672,00:38:57,00:39:05,Lead trace found in Carl Abrams' wound and pellet size matches the shotgun and the ammunition we found in your home.
673,00:39:05,00:39:11,"Don't tell me I'm the only one who uses that ammo. No, but you're the only one that was up on the ridge that night with Carl Abrams."
674,00:39:13,00:39:14,Maybe you recognize...
675,00:39:14,00:39:17,Carl's hand.
676,00:39:17,00:39:21,We found your DNA underneath his fingernails.
677,00:39:21,00:39:23,I guess he must have scratched you.
678,00:39:23,00:39:28,"In death, Carl has given us more than enough to convict you."
679,00:39:28,00:39:31,My son is not what that kid tried to make him.
680,00:39:31,00:39:33,I had to protect Dylan.
681,00:39:33,00:39:35,By killing the boy?
682,00:39:35,00:39:37,I told him to stay away; he laughed in my face!
683,00:39:37,00:39:41,He said my son didn't belong to me anymore.
684,00:39:41,00:39:42,That he belonged to him.
685,00:39:42,00:39:44,That Dylan was born to...
686,00:39:44,00:39:46,(panting)
687,00:39:46,00:39:48,...to love him.
688,00:39:50,00:39:53,My son was born to be a man.
689,00:39:53,00:39:55,He was.
690,00:39:55,00:39:58,And he proved that when he signed this confession.
691,00:40:09,00:40:10,Dad.
692,00:40:12,00:40:15,"I'm so sorry, Dad."
693,00:40:15,00:40:18,(crying): It's all my fault.
694,00:40:18,00:40:19,"No, no, no, no."
695,00:40:19,00:40:21,I'm just glad you're okay.
696,00:40:21,00:40:25,I knew that the first time I sneaked out.
697,00:40:25,00:40:30,I just-- I saw the campfires and I heard the other kids' voices in the night.
698,00:40:30,00:40:32,"I just wanted to be a part of it. It's okay, honey."
699,00:40:32,00:40:36,"Every kid wants to explore the world, okay?"
700,00:40:36,00:40:40,"But that's just it, Dad-- I had a world."
701,00:40:40,00:40:44,"You loved me enough to make one for me, and I destroyed it."
702,00:40:44,00:40:46,I've let all the bad in.
703,00:40:46,00:40:50,"Because you're right, Dad, that's all there is out there."
704,00:40:50,00:40:53,"And when you open the door, that's all that comes in."
705,00:40:53,00:40:56,"No, no, no, no, sweetheart, no."
706,00:40:56,00:40:57,(sighs)
707,00:40:57,00:41:00,I was wrong.
708,00:41:00,00:41:03,"See, when I was your age..."
709,00:41:03,00:41:05,nothing could hold me back.
710,00:41:05,00:41:08,Everything was possible.
711,00:41:08,00:41:11,And I robbed that from you.
712,00:41:11,00:41:16,"When we lost Mom, I kept you from everything and everyone that you knew."
713,00:41:16,00:41:19,"Well, the important thing now is where you go from here."
714,00:41:21,00:41:23,"Not underground, that's for sure."
715,00:41:23,00:41:25,"Dad, are you sure?"
716,00:41:25,00:41:27,"Yeah, I'm sure."
717,00:41:27,00:41:32,Remember when you asked me if I had any plans for Miranda when she turned 17?
718,00:41:32,00:41:34,Yeah.
719,00:41:34,00:41:37,"Well, there's a town up in Oregon where your mom's from."
720,00:41:37,00:41:43,"It's this perfect little place-- it's got this quaint little Main Street, everyone knows each other."
721,00:41:43,00:41:45,"Sounds like a really, really good idea."
722,00:41:45,00:41:46,It is.
723,00:41:46,00:41:48,"Honey, you got family there."
724,00:41:48,00:41:52,I think that's a pretty good place for you to start all over.
725,00:41:52,00:41:53,What do you say?
726,00:41:55,00:41:57,(laughs)
727,00:42:00,00:42:02,"I love you, sweetheart."
728,00:42:02,00:42:05,"(sighs) I love you, too, Dad."
