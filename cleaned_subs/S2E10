0	00:00:23	00:00:24	Are you all right?
1	00:00:25	00:00:27	I'm barred.
2	00:00:27	00:00:32	I've got, like, $10,000 in chips, and I cannot cash it.
3	00:00:32	00:00:38	Look, if I kept an eye on you two, could you please just go in there and just claim my money?
4	00:00:38	00:00:43	Sure, we can do that for you, but you don't have to keep your eye on us.
5	00:00:43	00:00:44	We're honest people.
6	00:00:44	00:00:51	I'm sure you are, but, come on, if I'm gonna be giving you ten grand in chips, I just gotta know that you're coming back.
7	00:00:52	00:00:54	We could give you a deposit.
8	00:00:54	00:00:56	What kind of deposit?
9	00:00:57	00:01:01	$2,000 would give me peace of mind.
10	00:01:01	00:01:06	You do that, I will give you back your deposit plus another thousand.
11	00:01:11	00:01:13	I'm sorry, sir, I can't cash this for you.
12	00:01:14	00:01:15	What? Why?
13	00:01:15	00:01:16	They're worthless.
14	00:01:33	00:01:35	The guy was running one of the oldest scams in Vegas.
15	00:01:36	00:01:40	Would have got away with it too, until the getaway driver put a nickel in the guy's jukebox.
16	00:01:40	00:01:42	Those are the Ortons from Florida.
17	00:01:42	00:01:44	Are you sure about that?
18	00:01:45	00:01:48	The couple ID'd the deceased as the con man.
19	00:01:54	00:01:58	That's the Ortons' money It's mine now.
20	00:01:58	00:02:00	- Surveillance? - Not in the garage.
21	00:02:03	00:02:06	Banana skids and fresh blood. That helps.
22	00:02:06	00:02:08	Oil slick doesn't hurt us either.
23	00:02:08	00:02:10	Hey, Jim.
24	00:02:10	00:02:12	- Got these from the cage. - Thanks, Sam.
25	00:02:14	00:02:18	The chip clip. Haven't seen that one in a while.
26	00:02:19	00:02:21	Striking resemblance to Judas.
27	00:02:21	00:02:23	How's that?
28	00:02:23	00:02:26	Both lost their lives over a worthless bag of chips.
29	00:03:03	00:03:09	Punk rock music on hi-fi Hey, Sanders. No punk rock.
30	00:03:09	00:03:11	What about Black Flag?
31	00:03:11	00:03:13	Are you nuts?
32	00:03:17	00:03:19	Whoa! Careful.
33	00:03:19	00:03:22	- Livestock. Hissing roaches from Madagascar. - Sorry.
34	00:03:23	00:03:25	These babies run 2 1/2 miles an hour.
35	00:03:25	00:03:29	- I don't doubt it for a minute. - 5th Annual Entomological Convention in Duluth.
36	00:03:29	00:03:30	Cockroach racing finals.
37	00:03:30	00:03:32	You're roach racing?
38	00:03:32	00:03:36	Actually, I'm giving a tutorial in preserving mass crime scenes.
39	00:03:36	00:03:38	The sideshow is racing these guys.
40	00:03:38	00:03:46	To nave a chance to run against legendary roaches like Cocky Balboa, The Drain Lover, Priscilla, Queen Of The Gutters. It's huge.
41	00:03:47	00:03:48	- What do you feed those guys? - Dog food.
42	00:03:49	00:03:52	- And who's supervising Night shift? - You are.
43	00:03:52	00:03:55	Me? I am on the red-eye to Reno.
44	00:03:55	00:03:58	The Braun family is opening a new casino. I am Sam's date.
45	00:03:58	00:04:00	That's tonight?
46	00:04:00	00:04:02	I told you once. Memoed you twice.
47	00:04:03	00:04:06	Man, these guys are primed.
48	00:04:10	00:04:11	You better get somebody.
49	00:04:12	00:04:14	A-slash? Acting supervisor.
50	00:04:15	00:04:18	What about Nick? He's got seniority.
51	00:04:18	00:04:20	Or Sara. She'd jump at the chance.
52	00:04:20	00:04:22	If it was about seniority, I'd ask Nick.
53	00:04:22	00:04:24	For staying up three straight days, I'd ask Sara.
54	00:04:25	00:04:27	- Instead, I want you. - And if I ask why?
55	00:04:27	00:04:30	Your curiosity would be better served on the case.
56	00:04:30	00:04:34	The shooting death of a con man at the Tropicana. Our guys are already there.
57	00:04:34	00:04:36	Hang on.
58	00:04:36	00:04:39	Have you told Nick and Sara about this?
59	00:04:39	00:04:40	No.
60	00:05:42	00:05:45	I got one left Smile.
61	00:05:47	00:05:49	- Lovely. - Hey.
62	00:05:50	00:05:52	- Nice of you to show up. - We're done here, brother.
63	00:05:53	00:05:54	I'm sorry. I got detained.
64	00:05:55	00:05:58	- You did a one-to-one on these treads? - Yeah, I just finished.
65	00:05:58	00:06:00	- Put together an evidence list? - No.
66	00:06:00	00:06:04	- You gotta do it. You were late. - I don't think so. I gotta go back with the body.
67	00:06:06	00:06:11	Sara, can you get back to the lab and put a rush on this analysis?
68	00:06:11	00:06:14	- Who died and made you boss? - He's not exactly dead.
69	00:06:16	00:06:18	Grissom gave you the shift tonight.
70	00:06:24	00:06:27	Anything you wanna say?
71	00:06:27	00:06:29	Yeah.
72	00:06:29	00:06:30	Good luck.
73	00:06:41	00:06:43	Get a speeding ticket?
74	00:06:43	00:06:46	Side roads. So...
75	00:06:47	00:06:49	this is our con artiste?
76	00:06:49	00:06:51	Vincent Thomas Avery. ID'd him from his prints.
77	00:06:51	00:06:54	- Tell you anything? - No mystery in cause of death.
78	00:06:54	00:06:56	Gunshot wound to the outer ear.
79	00:06:56	00:06:59	Left ear at that.
80	00:06:59	00:07:01	Probably when he was getting into the car.
81	00:07:04	00:07:05	He knew the driver.
82	00:07:06	00:07:10	Soot deposition on the skin surrounding the entry wound tells the story.
83	00:07:10	00:07:18	The bullet entered the external auditory meatus fracturing the skull base - The hardest bone of the skull. - You got any pictures of that?
84	00:07:18	00:07:20	Hot off the fluoroscope.
85	00:07:20	00:07:22	Haven't had the pleasure yet.
86	00:07:24	00:07:26	Hello! There is your bullet.
87	00:07:27	00:07:30	Deformed projectile on the right side of the calvarium.
88	00:07:30	00:07:32	- Can you fish that out for me? - You bet.
89	00:07:34	00:07:36	Wait a minute.
90	00:07:41	00:07:58	There's something in his stomach Something tells me this isn't filled with white sugar.
91	00:08:02	00:08:11	- How many more are there? - I'd say about 50 balloons The green dye you see here is probably from lime-flavoured gelatine.
92	00:08:11	00:08:13	Makes them much easier to swallow.
93	00:08:13	00:08:15	He's a mule.
94	00:08:17	00:08:22	Why is a guy trafficking in big-pay drugs wasting his time on some nickel-and-dime chip scam?
95	00:08:24	00:08:27	Hey. I got the horsepower on your vic.
96	00:08:27	00:08:30	Vincent Avery. Age 28. Con man out of Atlantic City.
97	00:08:30	00:08:34	Enough petty thefts and grand larcenies on his record to choke a hippo.
98	00:08:34	00:08:36	Hey, Jim.
99	00:08:36	00:08:39	What do you make of that void? Nail?
100	00:08:39	00:08:41	Either that or a spot on your lens.
101	00:08:41	00:08:44	Don't say that.
102	00:08:48	00:08:50	Hey!
103	00:08:50	00:08:53	You making a cake? What's the hold-up on my pills?
104	00:08:53	00:08:54	Process.
105	00:08:54	00:08:58	Just because you got passed over, don't take it out on me.
106	00:08:58	00:09:00	He didn't pass me over.
107	00:09:00	00:09:04	- Really? What would you call it, then? - Grissom.
108	00:09:04	00:09:05	Ah.
109	00:09:18	00:09:19	Coal.
110	00:09:21	00:09:25	Wood And coconut shells.
111	00:09:36	00:09:39	Activated carbon. Activated charcoal pills.
112	00:09:39	00:09:43	Best antacid in the world. Coats the stomach and absorbs impurities.
113	00:09:43	00:09:46	It's great if you're a mule transporting drugs.
114	00:09:46	00:09:47	Our con man's a mule?
115	00:09:48	00:09:50	We found balloons of cocaine in his stomach cavity.
116	00:09:50	00:09:58	Without the pills one bite of a chocolate bar would produce enough gastric acid to eat away the balloon causing him to OD.
117	00:09:58	00:10:03	- Then he went out and got shot. - Speaking of which, I found airline stubs in Avery's shirt.
118	00:10:03	00:10:07	- What? - Vincent Avery was 4A, Ellie Rebecca was 4B.
119	00:10:07	00:10:09	Strange, right, using two first names?
120	00:10:09	00:10:14	What's strange is going into the evidence locker after post and finding nothing left.
121	00:10:14	00:10:16	Don't make me feel bad for doing my job.
122	00:10:16	00:10:18	If it was your job, you couldn't feel bad.
123	00:10:19	00:10:21	Well, I think I hear some coffee perking.
124	00:10:25	00:10:28	What do you want from me? I'm working the case. The case is hot.
125	00:10:28	00:10:30	It's my case. Tonight, I'm the primary.
126	00:10:30	00:10:34	I have to process it. If you have a problem with that, you can clock out now.
127	00:10:37	00:10:39	Am I clear?
128	00:10:40	00:10:41	Clear.
129	00:11:36	00:11:37	It couldn't be.
130	00:11:39	00:11:42	Corner of Paradise and Main...
131	00:11:45	00:11:47	- Hey. - Hey.
132	00:11:47	00:11:49	You have a daughter?
133	00:11:50	00:11:52	Where are you going with this?
134	00:11:52	00:11:56	Her prints are on airline stubs relating to tonight's homicide.
135	00:11:57	00:12:00	There's got to be more than one Ellie Brass in the world.
136	00:12:00	00:12:02	Ellie Rebecca Brass?
137	00:12:02	00:12:04	DOB 9/24/82.
138	00:12:04	00:12:09	554 Applegate Way.
139	00:12:09	00:12:10	OK, you told me.
140	00:12:10	00:12:15	- I got to bring her in. - PD brings in suspects. I'll put Vega on it.
141	00:12:15	00:12:17	You're hands-off?
142	00:12:17	00:12:20	Of course.
143	00:12:23	00:12:25	Just go in, right in there.
144	00:12:53	00:12:55	I'm fine.
145	00:12:56	00:12:58	I'm fine.
146	00:12:59	00:13:03	So, we're gonna pick up right where we left off, huh, Ellie?
147	00:13:13	00:13:16	You still documenting the money from the con man?
148	00:13:16	00:13:19	Every serial number. Evidence.
149	00:13:19	00:13:23	Did you know that 9T% of all 100-dollar bills have traces of cocaine on them?
150	00:13:24	00:13:26	I was the one that told you that.
151	00:13:26	00:13:27	Oh, yeah.
152	00:13:31	00:13:33	Hey, Ronnie.
153	00:13:33	00:13:35	Do you know what the intaglio script is?
154	00:13:35	00:13:38	The engraving on Ben Franklin's collar?
155	00:13:41	00:13:42	I don't see it on this bill.
156	00:13:43	00:13:44	Do you?
157	00:13:48	00:13:51	Everyone I sleep with dies.
158	00:13:53	00:13:54	Excuse me?
159	00:13:55	00:13:58	I slept with this sailor once, when I was 14.
160	00:13:58	00:14:00	He died overseas somewhere.
161	00:14:00	00:14:04	What was your relationship to Vincent Avery?
162	00:14:05	00:14:08	There was no relationship. I barely knew him.
163	00:14:08	00:14:10	You knew him enough to fly to Baja with him.
164	00:14:10	00:14:12	He invited me for the weekend.
165	00:14:12	00:14:16	I figured as long as he didn't chop me up, I'd have some fun.
166	00:14:16	00:14:18	Mind if I smoke?
167	00:14:20	00:14:23	- Yeah. - Plain sight.
168	00:14:28	00:14:31	It's a dummy chip. No casino logo.
169	00:14:31	00:14:35	Exactly the same kind of chips Vincent Avery used to scam the casinos.
170	00:14:35	00:14:38	Before he got shot.
171	00:14:38	00:14:46	So, you two fly down to Baja, pose as a married couple, bring back a stomach-load of blow, and then you run chip scams?
172	00:14:46	00:14:48	Who's taking your drug profits?
173	00:14:48	00:14:51	Man, I wish I knew what you were talking about.
174	00:14:51	00:14:55	- Someone catch you two working on the side? - I wasn't even there.
175	00:14:55	00:14:56	- Where were you? - Home.
176	00:14:56	00:14:59	- In the bathroom. - She was passing pellets of cocaine.
177	00:15:00	00:15:01	I'm outta here.
178	00:15:03	00:15:05	Sit down!
179	00:15:12	00:15:14	Thank you.
180	00:15:14	00:15:17	With your permission, we need to take some X-rays.
181	00:15:17	00:15:19	So long as you're the one doing them.
182	00:15:19	00:15:21	We'd also like to look at your car.
183	00:15:21	00:15:24	- I lent it to my boyfriend. - What is his name?
184	00:15:24	00:15:28	You know, you have this whole Lenny Kravitz thing going on.
185	00:15:30	00:15:33	- I'm not one for brothers, but... damn! - His name.
186	00:15:36	00:15:38	Keith Driscoll.
187	00:15:38	00:15:42	- Now you tell me to get involved. - Evidence against her isn't good.
188	00:15:42	00:15:44	Hey, listen. Nothing places her at the murder.
189	00:15:44	00:15:48	She mules drugs for a guy who ends up dead ten hours later?
190	00:15:48	00:15:50	A BS chip scam? A lousy alibi?
191	00:15:50	00:15:54	Vega's on it. He'll find your boyfriend. If I know my daughter, that's your shooter.
192	00:15:54	00:15:58	Brass, it's a big city.
193	00:15:58	00:16:00	Boyfriend could disappear.
194	00:16:00	00:16:03	But, hey, it's your kid.
195	00:16:08	00:16:11	Left scope is a government-issued $100 bill.
196	00:16:11	00:16:13	Right scope is the money from your tourists.
197	00:16:13	00:16:15	It confirms what you saw with the naked eye.
198	00:16:15	00:16:22	On a genuine bill The United States Of America is written in micro-letters on the border of Ben Franklin's portrait.
199	00:16:23	00:16:26	On the Ortons' bill, the intaglio script is blurred out.
200	00:16:27	00:16:31	Microprinting. A trick the Treasury uses to thwart photocopying a US bill.
201	00:16:31	00:16:37	What about pigmentation? Treasury seals and serial numbers... are the same colour, right?
202	00:16:37	00:16:40	They are on the bill on your left.
203	00:16:40	00:16:46	So the numbers on the right didn't hold the green ink No printer on the market can make a true green.
204	00:16:46	00:16:48	Blue and yellow hues always bleed in.
205	00:16:49	00:16:50	Our monetary system depends on it.
206	00:16:52	00:16:54	Who do we notify? The Treasury?
207	00:16:54	00:16:57	Secret Service Branch. They have a field office in Vegas.
208	00:16:57	00:16:59	I'll put these back in the evidence room.
209	00:17:01	00:17:06	Wait till the Ortons find out what we do with counterfeit money.
210	00:17:17	00:17:20	Nothing.
211	00:17:20	00:17:21	Told you I was clean.
212	00:17:21	00:17:24	So, you gave up your drugs to your boss, huh?
213	00:17:24	00:17:25	Boss?
214	00:17:25	00:17:30	Do you realise, every time you ingest one of those pellets, you risk dying of an overdose?
215	00:17:30	00:17:35	Only if I eat. Releases gastric acids. Blah, blah, blah.
216	00:17:35	00:17:36	So, you can just not eat.
217	00:17:37	00:17:40	You see, the thing with me is, I'm... mind over matter.
218	00:17:42	00:17:46	I can imagine a hamburger and... I'm full.
219	00:17:49	00:17:51	Will you fill me up, Warrick?
220	00:17:57	00:17:59	I don't think I can handle this.
221	00:17:59	00:18:02	- I gotta call Grissom. - Then call him.
222	00:18:02	00:18:04	But?
223	00:18:04	00:18:07	- I didn't say anything. - I heard it, bro, a but in there.
224	00:18:07	00:18:13	You know how Grissom is. If you ask him for the keys to the car, he's gonna ask you if you've done your homework.
225	00:18:13	00:18:15	Yeah. That's what I was thinking.
226	00:18:15	00:18:19	It's like a multiple-choice question. You know? You go with your first choice.
227	00:18:19	00:18:22	- Sack up. - Sack up.
228	00:18:37	00:18:39	So did Warrick tell you to call me?
229	00:18:39	00:18:41	You think you're my only friend in the PD?
230	00:18:41	00:18:43	I'm just telling you to be careful.
231	00:18:43	00:18:46	Am I supposed to hold my breath and count to ten?
232	00:18:46	00:18:50	Hey, look. We all get a little crazy when our kids are involved.
233	00:18:50	00:18:53	Look, I'm on the job. It's standard police work.
234	00:18:53	00:18:55	Enjoy Reno. I got this.
235	00:18:55	00:19:04	OK. Hey, but listen, if you find the boyfriend, don't go it alone Don't worry, I won't.
236	00:19:05	00:19:07	Dispatch. Navaho 4-1-9-7.
237	00:19:07	00:19:11	In pursuit of a '78 red Camaro. Suspect wanted for questioning.
238	00:19:40	00:19:42	Which one's Keith Driscoll?
239	00:19:42	00:19:45	I was just hitchhiking. I told the guy to let me out.
240	00:19:45	00:19:47	Get lost.
241	00:19:48	00:19:50	OK come on! Out!
242	00:19:50	00:19:53	- Easy, man! - I'm only gonna ask you once.
243	00:19:53	00:19:56	- What are you and Ellie into? - What do you mean?
244	00:19:56	00:19:59	You got her muling drugs from Mexico. You got her mixed up in a homicide.
245	00:19:59	00:20:03	You got it backwards, man. She turned me on to coke so I could stud for her.
246	00:20:05	00:20:07	You can't just shoot me, man.
247	00:20:15	00:20:17	Brass.
248	00:20:17	00:20:18	Yo, Jim.
249	00:20:19	00:20:21	- We got it. - Everything's cool.
250	00:20:21	00:20:24	This guy was gonna kill me, man. He pulled his gun.
251	00:20:24	00:20:26	I'm sure the officer felt his life was in danger, sir.
252	00:20:26	00:20:29	We wanna question you about the murder of Vincent Avery.
253	00:20:29	00:20:33	- I'm not riding with him. - You're right, you're not.
254	00:20:50	00:20:53	What do you mean, you can't give it back? It's all we have for our vacation.
255	00:20:53	00:20:57	Well, it's counterfeit. We have to take it out of circulation.
256	00:20:57	00:20:59	What?
257	00:21:00	00:21:04	Mr Orton, you don't look so surprised.
258	00:21:04	00:21:05	Matt? Honey?
259	00:21:05	00:21:09	I went to the gas station. The attendant said the hundred I had was phoney.
260	00:21:09	00:21:14	So I went to our branch bank here and I tried to exchange it, but they couldn't do it.
261	00:21:14	00:21:19	I mean, why would anybody turn in bad money if they can't get reimbursed for it?
262	00:21:19	00:21:28	Because it's in violation of Title 18, Section 473 of the United States Code, punishable by up to 15 years for knowingly passing on bad money.
263	00:21:28	00:21:32	- Oh, my God! - I just didn't wanna get stuck holding the bag.
264	00:21:32	00:21:33	Do you have a $20 bill?
265	00:21:34	00:21:36	Our wallets are up in the room.
266	00:21:36	00:21:37	I may have something.
267	00:21:39	00:21:41	Hm. You see the ghost?
268	00:21:42	00:21:45	Right there on the right.
269	00:21:45	00:21:48	- Oh, yeah. - They're embedded to prevent forgeries.
270	00:21:48	00:21:53	You should see Lincoln on the five. He looks really stressed out.
271	00:21:53	00:21:55	I wish I had met you last week.
272	00:21:55	00:22:00	A special agent from Secret Service wants to talk to you about the final deposition of this case.
273	00:22:08	00:22:10	Warrick Brown?
274	00:22:10	00:22:12	Special Agent Beckman, Treasury Department.
275	00:22:12	00:22:14	- Subbing in tonight, right? - Treasury Department?
276	00:22:14	00:22:17	We wanted to be sure CSI's on the same page on this counterfeit case.
277	00:22:17	00:22:20	- Counterfeit? - Our lab wants to analyse that money too.
278	00:22:20	00:22:23	- What money? - I didn't wanna interrupt you.
279	00:22:23	00:22:29	- On a federal case. - Agent Beckman, I'm Sara Sidle Could you excuse us for a minute?
280	00:22:31	00:22:36	Warrick, you gotta turn on your pager, man. I got Brass's daughter's car in the garage.
281	00:22:36	00:22:39	- I'm dealing with something. - That's why I didn't bring this to you.
282	00:22:40	00:22:43	Vega says we won't be able to hold the suspect for more than a half-hour.
283	00:22:43	00:22:45	Did Sidle hold back information?
284	00:22:45	00:22:47	I didn't not tell him.
285	00:22:47	00:22:51	- I ran with the case. I do it with Grissom. - Well, I'm not Grissom!
286	00:22:52	00:22:54	Guys.
287	00:22:55	00:22:57	I didn't say it.
288	00:22:59	00:23:05	Sara, brief Special Agent Beckman on the funny money. Nick, garage.
289	00:23:10	00:23:50	Time Has Come Today Young hearts can go that way Can't put it off another day I don't care what others say They say we don't listen anyway Time has come today Oh, the rules have changed today I have no place to stay Hey!
290	00:23:50	00:23:53	Thinking about the subway Hey!
291	00:23:53	00:23:57	The love has flown away Hey!
292	00:23:57	00:24:01	My tears have come and gone Hey!
293	00:24:01	00:24:05	Oh, my Lord, I have to roam Hey!
294	00:24:05	00:24:08	I have no home Hey!
295	00:24:08	00:24:13	I have no home Hey!
296	00:24:18	00:24:20	Tyre plug.
297	00:24:20	00:24:22	That's a nail in sheep's clothing.
298	00:24:24	00:24:26	Treads from the crime scene.
299	00:24:27	00:24:31	The void on the one-to-one matches the void on Ellie's left rear tyre.
300	00:24:32	00:24:34	Siamese twins.
301	00:24:34	00:24:37	Proves one thing. This was the getaway car used in the murder.
302	00:24:38	00:24:39	Yeah.
303	00:24:41	00:24:43	We printed the vehicle your client was found driving.
304	00:24:44	00:24:47	It puts the car at the scene of Avery's murder less than 12 hours ago.
305	00:24:47	00:24:51	Come off it. The car's not even registered to him.
306	00:24:51	00:24:53	No. The girl he bought tickets to Baja for.
307	00:24:53	00:24:55	He bought tickets for Avery as well.
308	00:24:55	00:25:00	The tickets were bought with your credit card, but we have no proof he ever went down there.
309	00:25:00	00:25:02	- He's generous - Till Avery made him mad.
310	00:25:02	00:25:05	You wanna talk about the gun your captain pulled on my client?
311	00:25:05	00:25:09	An unarmed man. That's got PD brutality written all over it.
312	00:25:09	00:25:11	Vega?
313	00:25:11	00:25:13	Safety precaution only.
314	00:25:16	00:25:19	- We're done. - Let's go.
315	00:25:26	00:25:29	You suspect them of a high-end counterfeit operation?
316	00:25:29	00:25:32	No, but it did get me thinking.
317	00:25:32	00:25:34	If something doesn't feel right, it probably isn't.
318	00:25:35	00:25:38	Take a look. This is the money that we got from the con man.
319	00:25:38	00:25:41	See the serial numbers? Each one is different.
320	00:25:46	00:25:50	- Just like real money. - That's what threw Ronnie and I off the scent.
321	00:25:50	00:25:54	This couple didn't make one bill and run 100 copies with the same serial number.
322	00:26:01	00:26:03	They had to burn separate plates for each number.
323	00:26:08	00:26:10	Much harder to catch.
324	00:26:11	00:26:13	The very high end.
325	00:26:13	00:26:15	The Duffys are major counterfeiters.
326	00:26:15	00:26:17	You mean the Ortons.
327	00:26:17	00:26:21	My investigators tell me they're the Duffys from Las Vegas County.
328	00:26:21	00:26:22	Orton's their assumed names.
329	00:26:23	00:26:24	How long have you known that?
330	00:26:24	00:26:27	I went on the T-Department database.
331	00:26:27	00:26:31	They've each done time for fraud. And, yes, high-end counterfeiting.
332	00:26:31	00:26:34	- You federal guys are sneaky. - Access.
333	00:26:34	00:26:36	So, what do you wanna do with the money?
334	00:26:36	00:26:40	It's your money now. Well, the Treasury's.
335	00:26:42	00:26:44	Thanks. I'll take it from here.
336	00:26:44	00:26:46	Find the operation and shut it down.
337	00:26:46	00:26:48	Hey!
338	00:26:49	00:26:52	- I'm still part of this. - Not really.
339	00:26:52	00:26:55	But you're making me look good, so if you wanna tag along...
340	00:26:55	00:26:58	- I don't tag along. - Suit yourself.
341	00:27:05	00:27:10	We got bad news from the garage Give it to me.
342	00:27:10	00:27:13	The tyre evidence puts Ellie's car at the murder scene.
343	00:27:13	00:27:17	- We'll be pressing charges for Avery's murder. - Come on. You know she didn't kill him.
344	00:27:17	00:27:21	- Keith Driscoll did. - Maybe so, but we don't have Driscoll.
345	00:27:21	00:27:24	- What? - Vega had to let him go after your gun episode.
346	00:27:24	00:27:27	Oh, I get it. Vega thinks she'll eventually rat out Driscoll.
347	00:27:28	00:27:33	- That's what you cops think. - Let me tell you something about my daughter.
348	00:27:33	00:27:34	Never happen.
349	00:27:49	00:27:52	- Are they arresting me? - I'm gonna bail you out.
350	00:27:53	00:27:55	You can stay at my place.
351	00:27:55	00:27:56	I have a place.
352	00:27:56	00:27:58	You have a place?
353	00:27:58	00:28:02	Keith and I do. We share everything.
354	00:28:07	00:28:12	Ellie, why do you do this to yourself? You're better than that.
355	00:28:12	00:28:14	You're better than him.
356	00:28:14	00:28:16	No, I'm not.
357	00:28:42	00:28:45	Grissom's office. CSI. Warrick speaking.
358	00:28:45	00:28:48	Warrick it's Vega. I got a 444.
359	00:28:48	00:28:51	Officer involved shooting? Who?
360	00:28:51	00:28:53	One guess.
361	00:29:26	00:29:28	You've just bounced off the glass ceiling.
362	00:29:29	00:29:30	Excuse me?
363	00:29:30	00:29:35	Brass buys his daughter a get-out-of-jail-free card and her boyfriend ends up on a gurney.
364	00:29:35	00:29:39	Ecklie, you're Day shift, and you're here because...?
365	00:29:39	00:29:42	- I'm dedicated. - Yeah. Picture that.
366	00:29:45	00:29:48	- What happened? - Driscoll shot in the throat.
367	00:29:48	00:29:53	First officer here found Brass in the apartment, woozy. Keith Driscoll on the floor, lights out.
368	00:29:53	00:29:57	- Where's his daughter? - No-one knows. I got guys looking for her.
369	00:29:57	00:29:59	- Check his weapon? - Waiting on you guys.
370	00:30:24	00:30:26	There's one round missing.
371	00:30:36	00:30:39	It's just you and me talking now, Jim.
372	00:30:39	00:30:43	Off the record You went to the apartment?
373	00:30:43	00:30:45	Yeah.
374	00:30:45	00:30:47	- You notify Dispatch? - It was a personal visit.
375	00:30:47	00:30:51	- But you went looking for Keith Driscoll. - No.
376	00:30:51	00:30:53	I went looking for Ellie.
377	00:30:55	00:30:56	Where is she?
378	00:30:58	00:31:01	- Where is she? - She's not here. Hey, you got a warrant?
379	00:31:04	00:31:07	Everything's a blur after that.
380	00:31:07	00:31:09	Do you remember drawing your gun?
381	00:31:09	00:31:11	No.
382	00:31:11	00:31:14	You're leaving something out.
383	00:31:16	00:31:18	Hey, you got a warrant?
384	00:31:19	00:31:22	Ellie, are you here?
385	00:31:22	00:31:25	- I'm not leaving anything out. - Your daughter lives there.
386	00:31:25	00:31:29	She probably saw what happened. We're gonna pick her up eventually.
387	00:31:31	00:31:33	Careful. She spits.
388	00:31:38	00:31:40	One shot?
389	00:31:40	00:31:43	15 bullets left in Brass's gun. There should be 16.
390	00:31:43	00:31:47	What cop doesn't empty his magazine? They're trained to shoot to kill.
391	00:31:58	00:32:00	Hey!
392	00:32:02	00:32:05	Look where I just located this blood.
393	00:32:05	00:32:09	- The back of the grip. - Novices get their hands pinched in the slide.
394	00:32:11	00:32:15	Slide bite Man.
395	00:32:15	00:32:17	Brass didn't shoot this guy.
396	00:32:18	00:32:20	I need you to show me your hands.
397	00:32:20	00:32:23	You're testing for gunshot residue? It's a little late for that.
398	00:32:23	00:32:25	Your hands, Captain.
399	00:32:30	00:32:32	Satisfied?
400	00:32:32	00:32:34	I'm gonna need to take your badge.
401	00:32:34	00:32:37	It's not your job to take my stripes.
402	00:32:37	00:32:39	In this case, it is.
403	00:32:40	00:32:43	- Detective Vega. - No.
404	00:32:57	00:33:01	AB Dick 4910. 11 x 14 offsets.
405	00:33:01	00:33:05	This is the Rolls-Royce of printers. The closest thing to what the government uses.
406	00:33:05	00:33:07	Multiple inks.
407	00:33:08	00:33:10	Disaperf computer paper.
408	00:33:10	00:33:13	Heavy rag. 25% content. Makes for durability.
409	00:33:13	00:33:16	Mr Duffy, can Agent Beckman and I see your burn plates, please?
410	00:33:30	00:33:32	Press, ink, paper, burn plates.
411	00:33:33	00:33:37	Only question now is where's the money...
412	00:33:39	00:33:41	...Mr and Mrs Duffy?
413	00:33:43	00:33:45	There isn't any.
414	00:33:45	00:33:50	Oh, come on. You can print a million dollars a day with this operation. Where is it?
415	00:33:50	00:33:52	- There is no money. - Excuse me?
416	00:33:55	00:33:56	I don't get this. Beckman...
417	00:33:57	00:33:58	Congratulations, Sidle.
418	00:33:59	00:34:01	- You passed. - Passed?
419	00:34:01	00:34:04	Duffy is their code alias.
420	00:34:04	00:34:09	This is Special Agent Conners, Special Agent Tessari. We're all with Service.
421	00:34:09	00:34:12	- I don't... - We put bait money in the hands of bad people.
422	00:34:12	00:34:14	In this case, a reputed con.
423	00:34:15	00:34:17	To see how the money leads to law enforcement.
424	00:34:17	00:34:21	- What if Vincent Avery wasn't murdered? - Murder wasn't on the agenda.
425	00:34:21	00:34:25	However, in light of unpredictable events, the sting still upheld.
426	00:34:25	00:34:29	It came to you and you didn't take. You should be very proud.
427	00:34:29	00:34:32	Wow. I don't feel that at all.
428	00:34:32	00:34:34	It never feels right when it works.
429	00:34:34	00:34:37	Only feels wrong when it doesn't.
430	00:34:37	00:34:40	First, I have the saliva sample taken from Captain Brass's badge.
431	00:34:40	00:34:42	Better known as Ellie's DNA.
432	00:34:42	00:34:44	Take a good look at her markers.
433	00:34:45	00:34:48	Second, blood sample from Jim Brass.
434	00:34:48	00:34:50	They're nothing alike.
435	00:34:50	00:34:54	From parent to child, seven of thirteen markers should match up. Minimum.
436	00:34:54	00:34:57	In this case, there's not one marker in common.
437	00:34:57	00:35:01	I don't have Ellie's mother's DNA on file, - but my guess is... - Was she adopted?
438	00:35:05	00:35:07	Whew!
439	00:35:07	00:35:09	What about the blood on Brass's gun?
440	00:35:09	00:35:11	Not Brass's. Not Ellie's.
441	00:35:11	00:35:13	Not Ellie's?
442	00:35:13	00:35:15	No, or her boyfriend Keith Driscoll.
443	00:35:16	00:35:18	You still got a shooter out there.
444	00:35:18	00:35:20	With a pinch on his hand.
445	00:35:22	00:35:24	All right. Where's that manifest?
446	00:35:29	00:35:31	Vincent Avery.
447	00:35:34	00:35:36	2034.
448	00:35:40	00:35:42	2034.
449	00:35:48	00:35:50	Marty Gilmore.
450	00:36:01	00:36:03	Hold it, hold it.

478	00:38:00	00:38:02	A man's gotta do...
479	00:38:05	00:38:07	What is it, Rick?
480	00:38:08	00:38:11	We were checking out the blood from your gun.
481	00:38:11	00:38:14	- We compared your DNA to her DNA. - Yeah?

483	00:38:24	00:38:26	She's not.
484	00:38:27	00:38:29	Call it the mailman.
485	00:38:32	00:38:34	Ellie doesn't know.
486	00:38:55	00:38:56	Ellie?
487	00:39:00	00:39:03	How did you find me?
488	00:39:03	00:39:05	I'm a detective.
489	00:39:08	00:39:11	I heard you never went back to Driscoll's apartment that night.
490	00:39:11	00:39:14	It's true.
491	00:39:14	00:39:17	I could have sworn I heard you in that other room.
492	00:39:17	00:39:19	No, Dad.
493	00:39:19	00:39:22	I was never there. Never.
494	00:39:23	00:39:26	I guess I've been doing that since you've been born.
495	00:39:26	00:39:30	I mean, I know I was never around, but...
496	00:39:32	00:39:34	You know, no matter where I am...
497	00:39:37	00:39:39	...no matter what I'm doing...

500	00:39:49	00:39:52	Come back to me, Ellie.
501	00:39:57	00:39:59	Dad...
502	00:39:59	00:40:01	it's way too late.
503	00:40:07	00:40:09	I've got to catch a flight to Jersey.
504	00:40:09	00:40:11	Midnight.
505	00:40:11	00:40:13	Mom says...

519	00:41:07	00:41:09	Hey Griss!
520	00:41:09	00:41:12	- How did it go? - The seminar was fine.
521	00:41:12	00:41:16	Every one of my roaches got stage fright.
522	00:41:16	00:41:18	They came in fourth, third, second...
523	00:41:18	00:41:20	and dead last.
524	00:41:20	00:41:22	How about you? How did you do?
525	00:41:22	00:41:26	Well, the job is fine. It's the other stuff, the personalities.
526	00:41:26	00:41:29	I love mankind, it's people I can't stand?
527	00:41:29	00:41:31	- Who's that? Einstein? - Linus.
528	00:41:31	00:41:33	Charlie Brown. Figures.
529	00:41:33	00:41:35	Is that why you put me in charge?
530	00:41:35	00:41:37	You think I like dealing with people?
531	00:41:37	00:41:39	Remember you asked me what I was in high school?
532	00:41:39	00:41:41	Yeah. You said a ghost.
533	00:41:41	00:41:44	When I leave CSI, there won't be cake in the break room. I'll be gone.
534	00:41:44	00:41:47	So I wanted to see if you could step in.
535	00:41:47	00:41:50	Tell me.
536	00:41:50	00:41:52	All of it. From the top.
537	00:41:52	00:41:54	From the top?
538	00:42:01	00:42:03	I don't know where to start.
539	00:42:04	00:42:06	It was wild.
