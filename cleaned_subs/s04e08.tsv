0	00:00:16	00:00:17	Some girls want to be homecoming queen.
1	00:00:18	00:00:20	Some girls want to be Miss America.
2	00:00:20	00:00:24	I have always wanted to be a showgirl.
3	00:00:24	00:00:29	I mean, I've been taking dancing lessons since I was five.
4	00:00:29	00:00:41	I would, um... I would pull my leotards really high up on my hips, and stick feathers in my hair, put on my mom's high heels, and then I would put on this show.
5	00:00:42	00:00:51	This is day six in the search for Julie Waters, the model and aspiring showgirl reported missing by her parents last Thursday.
6	00:00:51	00:00:56	Authorities are asking for the public's help in any information regarding her whereabouts.
7	00:00:56	00:00:58	Where is Julie Waters?
8	00:00:58	00:01:00	That's the question authorities are asking...
9	00:01:01	00:01:03	What is your emergency?
10	00:01:03	00:01:05	She's so beautiful.
11	00:01:05	00:01:09	Soft and... sweet...
12	00:01:09	00:01:12	like an angel.
13	00:01:12	00:01:13	What is your emergency?
14	00:01:13	00:01:15	I never meant to hurt her.
15	00:01:15	00:01:16	Sir?
16	00:01:16	00:01:21	I couldn't get the smile off of my face.
17	00:01:21	00:01:26	I didn't even see when the security guard came up to me, and he told me that I had to leave.
18	00:01:26	00:01:29	You know, All rehearsals are closed.
19	00:01:29	00:01:35	So I got up, and then he turns to me...
20	00:01:50	00:01:51	He's coming out.
21	00:01:52	00:01:55	suspect is armed.
22	00:01:55	00:01:57	He's coming out.
23	00:02:02	00:02:04	We have visual.
24	00:02:04	00:02:09	Drop the weapon! Freeze! Freeze!
25	00:02:09	00:02:11	Get on your knees right now!
26	00:02:11	00:02:14	Right now! Right on your knees!
27	00:02:22	00:02:24	Look for the girl.
28	00:02:33	00:02:34	Captain! Captain!
29	00:02:34	00:02:36	Captain! Captain Brass!
30	00:02:36	00:02:37	Where is she?
31	00:02:37	00:02:39	Huh?
32	00:02:41	00:02:42	See this face?
33	00:02:42	00:02:44	I'm going to be all over you till you give her up.
34	00:02:45	00:02:46	Jim, the world's watching.
35	00:02:48	00:02:50	I want him waiting for me.
36	00:02:56	00:02:58	SWAT cleared the house. It's empty.
37	00:02:58	00:03:00	So no girl?
38	00:03:02	00:03:04	What did he blow?
39	00:03:04	00:03:05	A .21.
40	00:03:06	00:03:07	Going to take him a long time to sober up.
41	00:03:08	00:03:08	I'm not waiting.
42	00:03:09	00:03:10	Did he say anything about her?
43	00:03:10	00:03:12	He never actually mentioned her name.
44	00:03:12	00:03:15	All he said was, I never meant to hurt her.
45	00:03:15	00:03:18	Six days missing?
46	00:03:19	00:03:21	He didn't just hurt her.
47	00:03:56	00:04:06	At this time, the Las Vegas Police Department has in custody one Howard Delhomme, whom we believe to be responsible for the disappearance of Julie Waters.
48	00:04:06	00:04:11	Our forensic team is currently combing the Delhomme residence searching for clues to her whereabouts.
49	00:04:13	00:04:15	Sheriff, how long will it take to find her?
50	00:04:15	00:04:20	I expect an answer to that just as soon as the team is finished processing the house.
51	00:04:20	00:04:22	Attaboy, Sheriff.
52	00:04:22	00:04:24	Nothing like predicting the future.
53	00:04:29	00:04:31	This guy was unraveling.
54	00:04:41	00:04:47	This is like a timeline day one all the way up until this morning.
55	00:04:57	00:05:02	I mean, I've been taking dancing lessons since I was five.
56	00:05:02	00:05:04	I would, um... I would pull my leotards...
57	00:05:04	00:05:07	More Julie Waters.
58	00:05:07	00:05:11	...stick feathers in my hair, put on my mom's high heels...
59	00:06:09	00:06:12	Media's gone now.
60	00:06:12	00:06:13	Just you and me.
61	00:06:15	00:06:18	Where is she?
62	00:06:20	00:06:24	Nobody calls 911 unless they're ready to talk.
63	00:06:26	00:06:28	Tell me.
64	00:06:30	00:06:32	Tell me.
65	00:06:32	00:06:34	Get used to this room, bud.
66	00:06:34	00:06:35	You're not going anywhere.
67	00:06:40	00:06:43	Who reported Julie Waters missing?
68	00:06:43	00:06:44	Her mom.
69	00:06:44	00:06:46	She said she talks to her every day.
70	00:06:46	00:06:49	Called the station when she couldn't reach her by nightfall.
71	00:06:49	00:06:52	Grissom sent Nick and I to her apartment on the missing.
72	00:06:52	00:06:55	Her bills were paid, ready to mail.
73	00:06:58	00:07:00	Doesn't look like any of her toiletries were missing.
74	00:07:03	00:07:06	She even left her birth control pills. Strange.
75	00:07:06	00:07:10	Her mom said she had dinner with the producers of Real Vegas Showgirls.
76	00:07:10	00:07:12	What's that?
77	00:07:13	00:07:16	It's a reality-based show shooting here in Vegas.
78	00:07:16	00:07:18	What about her car?
79	00:07:18	00:07:23	It was found four days ago at Dante's Pizza on Boulder Highway-- parking lot. Locked.
80	00:07:23	00:07:25	No sign of foul play.
81	00:07:25	00:07:27	Purse?
82	00:07:27	00:07:30	It's the only thing that was missing.
83	00:07:30	00:07:32	What about the drunk guy?
84	00:07:32	00:07:34	A professional photographer.
85	00:07:34	00:07:38	Lives alone. ! You collected everything at his house-- no evidence of Julie?
86	00:07:38	00:07:43	Although the place was papered with articles about her, all acquired after the fact. ( phone ringing )
87	00:07:45	00:07:47	I was following protocol.
88	00:07:47	00:07:48	Come on, Joe.
89	00:07:48	00:07:50	I ask you to do one thing, and this happens?
90	00:07:50	00:07:51	I'm sorry, Captain.
91	00:07:51	00:07:53	I got called away on a PCP... Joe.
92	00:07:53	00:07:55	Where is he?
93	00:07:55	00:07:57	Getting stitched up, but he left something for you.
94	00:08:05	00:08:10	I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt anyone.
95	00:08:28	00:08:30	Anyone?
96	00:08:30	00:08:32	What's that supposed to mean?
97	00:08:32	00:08:34	That Julie Waters isn't his first victim?
98	00:08:34	00:08:36	He's done this before?
99	00:08:50	00:08:54	You want to take him into the next room, please?
100	00:09:00	00:09:02	Look, I know you want to make this right.
101	00:09:02	00:09:04	You called 911.
102	00:09:07	00:09:09	What, do you think you're going to walk out of here?
103	00:09:09	00:09:12	You're in for the long haul.
104	00:09:12	00:09:15	If you help me, I can help you.
105	00:09:15	00:09:17	We already know who you're talking about.
106	00:09:17	00:09:19	All we need to know is where to find her.
107	00:09:20	00:09:22	Are we boring you?
108	00:09:22	00:09:24	Huh?
109	00:09:24	00:09:27	'Cause what you're not getting is I got all night.
110	00:09:27	00:09:32	One of us is getting overtime to be here, and it isn't you, so talk to me.
111	00:09:32	00:09:39	I'll talk... only for the one in the next room-- the pretty one.
112	00:10:02	00:10:06	How many yards did you say it was from mile marker 15?
113	00:10:06	00:10:09	Why don't you take off your sunglasses and your hat?
114	00:10:09	00:10:11	Need your help here, Mr. Delhomme.
115	00:10:11	00:10:13	Howard.
116	00:10:13	00:10:15	All right.
117	00:10:15	00:10:18	Howard.
118	00:10:18	00:10:21	Are we in the right place?
119	00:10:22	00:10:24	You walk like a dancer.
120	00:10:24	00:10:26	Do you moonlight?
121	00:10:26	00:10:29	I'll bet you're featured, huh?
122	00:10:29	00:10:31	High dollar.
123	00:10:31	00:10:34	Nice long hair down your back?
124	00:10:34	00:10:36	What were you wearing that day, Howard?
125	00:10:36	00:10:38	I like long hair.
126	00:10:40	00:10:41	You recognize any of these rock formations?
127	00:10:42	00:10:44	You could grow yours out more, but...
128	00:11:18	00:11:19	What are we doing?
129	00:11:19	00:11:21	Is this logical?
130	00:11:21	00:11:24	We have suspects picking their criminalists now.
131	00:11:26	00:11:28	Well, we all want the same thing, Sara.
132	00:11:28	00:11:30	Catherine may have a way in.
133	00:11:30	00:11:32	It could be helpful.
134	00:11:32	00:11:35	So this looks helpful to you?
135	00:11:51	00:11:53	We're not finding anything.
136	00:11:53	00:11:55	You said she was here.
137	00:11:55	00:11:57	I'm getting confused... all these people here.
138	00:11:57	00:12:00	You'd be less confused if it was just you and me?
139	00:12:00	00:12:03	I see pictures of her on TV, in the magazines, the newspapers...
140	00:12:03	00:12:06	Mr. Delhomme, we're going to take you back to the station.
141	00:12:06	00:12:07	I'd rather go home.
142	00:12:07	00:12:09	Not yet.
143	00:12:11	00:12:13	Hey, uh... Get in!
144	00:12:13	00:12:14	we need him in one piece.
145	00:12:24	00:12:27	All right, at least we can hold onto him for a while.
146	00:12:27	00:12:29	Well, the public defender may have him out on bail by tomorrow morning.
147	00:12:29	00:12:31	Meanwhile, we still haven't found anything.
148	00:12:31	00:12:34	Now, did anyone stop to think this guy might just be nuts?
149	00:12:34	00:12:37	Well, until we find the body, he is all the evidence we've got.
150	00:12:37	00:12:38	We don't even know if he did it.
151	00:12:39	00:12:40	Oh, I've got a good feeling about this.
152	00:12:40	00:12:41	So does the suspect.
153	00:12:42	00:12:46	The only reason that we're out here today on this wild goose chase is because he wanted to hang out with you.
154	00:12:46	00:12:52	It's weird. Believe me, I'd rather follow the evidence, but if it takes having the evidence follow me...
155	00:12:52	00:12:56	The original missing persons call was mine and Sara's.
156	00:12:56	00:12:57	I'm the senior CSI here.
157	00:12:57	00:12:59	Uh, I'm the senior CSI here.
158	00:12:59	00:13:00	You want it?
159	00:13:00	00:13:02	Hold on, now.
160	00:13:02	00:13:03	This is a career case, Grissom.
161	00:13:03	00:13:05	You know Sara and I both put in for a promotion.
162	00:13:05	00:13:07	If we work this, we're on departmental radar here.
163	00:13:07	00:13:12	I got the most high-profile cases under my belt; I think that the sheriff would rest easier knowing that I was heading it up.
164	00:13:12	00:13:14	It's a big department.
165	00:13:14	00:13:15	There's a lot of room at the top.
166	00:13:15	00:13:18	We wouldn't ask for it if we couldn't do it.
167	00:13:27	00:13:28	Fine.
168	00:13:40	00:13:43	You going to have my back?
169	00:13:43	00:13:46	I always have your back.
170	00:13:46	00:13:49	He wanted me. He's got me.
171	00:13:51	00:13:58	Suspected murderer Howard Delhomme led police department personnel on a fruitless search for the body of Julie Waters.
172	00:13:58	00:14:05	The search was called off in darkness with no indication that law enforcement personnel will continue to comb the Red Rock area.
173	00:14:05	00:14:06	Just don't make me look bad.
174	00:14:07	00:14:08	Hey, you set the stage.
175	00:14:08	00:14:11	You know voters-- they like swift resolutions.
176	00:14:11	00:14:13	If he's the guy, I need to say it.
177	00:14:13	00:14:15	Well, let's find out if he is the guy first.
178	00:14:15	00:14:17	Who's that with Cath?
179	00:14:20	00:14:22	Greg Sanders. DNA.
180	00:14:22	00:14:23	Is he on the case?
181	00:14:23	00:14:24	Yeah.
182	00:14:24	00:14:28	Hell of a time to break out the B team, isn't it?
183	00:14:30	00:14:34	Remember, we're looking for anything this guy did last Thursday, November 6.
184	00:14:34	00:14:37	Find out where he was seven days ago, and we'll find Julie.
185	00:14:40	00:14:42	So, I know Warrick's off.
186	00:14:42	00:14:44	And Sara's pissed.
187	00:14:44	00:14:45	Why not ask Nick to help?
188	00:14:45	00:14:47	You want to learn.
189	00:14:49	00:14:52	And you can start by not repeating my mistakes.
190	00:14:52	00:14:54	You mean Sam Braun?
191	00:14:54	00:14:56	I screwed up.
192	00:14:56	00:14:57	You covered me.
193	00:14:57	00:14:59	That's why I'm here?
194	00:14:59	00:15:02	No, you're here because I want you to be here.
195	00:15:02	00:15:04	Oh.
196	00:15:06	00:15:07	He was hungry.
197	00:15:07	00:15:08	Big Snax.
198	00:15:08	00:15:10	The chain.
199	00:15:10	00:15:15	He bought soda for 75 cents, snack for 75 cents, and a household item for $9.99.
200	00:15:15	00:15:18	Household item? That could be anything.
201	00:15:21	00:15:29	Inucci Motors. He checked out a car 00 that afternoon, 00 a.m.
202	00:15:30	00:15:33	Why would Howard Delhomme have a receipt for one of your cars?
203	00:15:33	00:15:35	We hired him to photograph it.
204	00:15:35	00:15:38	Did you instruct him to hire a model for the photo shoot?
205	00:15:38	00:15:43	Model? Never. Nothing in the photograph should be sexier than the automobile.
206	00:15:43	00:15:45	Where is the car?
207	00:15:45	00:15:47	It's not just a car.
208	00:15:47	00:15:48	It's a Maserati.
209	00:15:48	00:15:50	Well, I appreciate that.
210	00:15:50	00:15:51	I still need to look at it.
211	00:15:51	00:15:52	Honey...
212	00:15:52	00:15:57	the car has been detailed three times since Howard brought it back.
213	00:15:57	00:15:59	It's getting primed for a whale tomorrow.
214	00:15:59	00:16:01	You're wasting your time.
215	00:16:01	00:16:04	You know what I did the last time I looked at a car?
216	00:16:04	00:16:07	I cut out a 12-by-12-inch section of leather from every seat.
217	00:16:07	00:16:10	Guy was a drug dealer.
218	00:16:10	00:16:12	You know, a salesman?
219	00:16:12	00:16:15	I need this car.
220	00:16:15	00:16:16	Untouched.
221	00:16:16	00:16:18	Oh, well, I can't promise you that.
222	00:16:18	00:16:25	But what I can promise you is that, for the next few hours, that car is mine.
223	00:17:18	00:17:21	Boy, what I could do with a car like this.
224	00:17:21	00:17:27	Take these and compare them to the toothbrush that Sara collected from Julie Waters' apartment.
225	00:17:30	00:17:31	Hey...
226	00:17:31	00:17:33	you want to gawk, do it on your own time.
227	00:17:33	00:17:34	You want to work with me, stay focused.
228	00:17:34	00:17:36	Got it.
229	00:17:39	00:17:41	I don't believe this.
230	00:17:43	00:17:45	What does it matter? We're all on the same team.
231	00:17:45	00:17:47	Nick, it was our case.
232	00:17:47	00:17:50	you wait a career for a case like this.
233	00:17:50	00:17:53	Put us on the front line for promotion.
234	00:17:53	00:17:55	Let's just find her, okay?
235	00:17:55	00:17:58	You know what the worst part about this whole thing is?
236	00:17:58	00:18:00	Catherine knows I can do this case.
237	00:18:00	00:18:01	So can I.
238	00:18:03	00:18:07	I would take you and me over Catherine and Greg anytime.
239	00:18:07	00:18:09	She's got Greg helping her?
240	00:18:09	00:18:11	Yeah.
241	00:18:14	00:18:15	Well, the only way to learn is by getting out in the field.
242	00:18:16	00:18:20	And, if Greg helps find her, I'm okay with that.
243	00:18:21	00:18:25	The first day that I got here I went straight to the Tropicana.
244	00:18:25	00:18:30	I walked right past all of the slots and the tables to the Tiffany Theater.
245	00:18:30	00:18:38	I snuck in, and I just sat there in the back row, just watching.
246	00:18:40	00:18:44	I couldn't get the smile off of my face.
247	00:18:46	00:18:51	I didn't even see when the security guard came up to me, and he told me that I had to leave.
248	00:18:51	00:18:53	You know, All rehearsals are closed.
249	00:18:53	00:18:56	So I got up.
250	00:18:57	00:19:01	And then he turns to me, and he says, um...
251	00:19:03	00:19:05	Go ahead and stay.
252	00:19:05	00:19:06	Is there anything on these tapes?
253	00:19:06	00:19:08	Nothing.
254	00:19:08	00:19:10	How's it going with the sheriff?
255	00:19:10	00:19:13	He wants to know why you're working with young Greg.
256	00:19:13	00:19:16	You could have had Warrick, you know.
257	00:19:16	00:19:17	Or asked Nick to help.
258	00:19:17	00:19:19	I need someone without an agenda.
259	00:19:19	00:19:21	Like when Fung brought in Mazzola?
260	00:19:22	00:19:24	Everybody lost.
261	00:19:24	00:19:25	This isn't O.J. Could be.
262	00:19:25	00:19:27	A trainee on a career case...
263	00:19:27	00:19:29	I know what I'm doing.
264	00:19:32	00:19:35	12 missing girls so far over the last two years-- ten of them found dead.
265	00:19:35	00:19:37	How many were models?
266	00:19:37	00:19:39	Just this one.
267	00:19:39	00:19:41	Robyn Knight.
268	00:19:41	00:19:44	Day shift found her skeletal remains six months ago.
269	00:19:47	00:19:51	Washed up during heavy rains.
270	00:19:51	00:19:52	Furnace Creek.
271	00:19:52	00:19:56	Left in the morning for a photo shoot.
272	00:19:56	00:20:00	Has a list of photographers in her day planner.
273	00:20:02	00:20:04	Guess whose name is on the list?
274	00:20:04	00:20:06	Howard Delhomme.
275	00:20:12	00:20:14	Hey.
276	00:20:19	00:20:21	How's it going?
277	00:20:21	00:20:23	Your case. You tell us.
278	00:20:26	00:20:30	The odometer of the Maserati had 142 miles on it.
279	00:20:30	00:20:35	The car dealer said that the vehicle only had nine miles when Delhomme picked it up.
280	00:20:35	00:20:39	That means that Delhomme drove it for 133 miles.
281	00:20:39	00:20:45	If you do the math, that makes the search radius approximately 66 miles.
282	00:20:45	00:20:50	Julie's vehicle was found in the parking lot of Dante's Pizza, off Boulder Highway.
283	00:20:50	00:20:52	That's what? 12 miles away?
284	00:20:52	00:20:55	It's probably where she hooked up with Delhomme.
285	00:20:55	00:20:57	So they hopped in the car and went to a photo shoot.
286	00:20:57	00:21:01	If they did do a photo shoot, and we don't even know that they did.
287	00:21:01	00:21:02	Where are the photos?
288	00:21:02	00:21:04	I finished the DNA from the car.
289	00:21:04	00:21:07	It matches the reference Sara got from Julie's apartment.
290	00:21:07	00:21:09	And the snack shop? It's the one on Granite's Pass.
291	00:21:11	00:21:15	I also found out what the household item was on the receipt.
292	00:21:15	00:21:16	It was a shovel.
293	00:21:16	00:21:19	He'd already killed her.
294	00:21:22	00:21:25	That explains the blood and the hair in the back seat of the Maserati.
295	00:21:25	00:21:30	He drove her body to the snack bar and went back and buried her.
296	00:21:30	00:21:31	Question is, where?
297	00:21:38	00:21:42	Robyn Knight washed up near Furnace Creek.
298	00:21:51	00:21:52	That's Devil's Smile.
299	00:22:25	00:22:27	I understand why all these cadets are here.
300	00:22:27	00:22:29	They have to be.
301	00:22:29	00:22:32	But what's up with all these off-duty cops?
302	00:22:32	00:22:34	Chance to be a hero.
303	00:22:34	00:22:37	Girl's beautiful.
304	00:22:37	00:22:39	These guys don't get many chances.
305	00:22:39	00:22:40	For what?
306	00:22:40	00:22:43	To rescue a princess.
307	00:22:43	00:22:46	I think we may have found something!
308	00:22:58	00:23:01	Hey, hey! Hold on.
309	00:23:01	00:23:03	Nobody touch the crime scene. We do this right.
310	00:23:11	00:23:13	All right...
311	00:23:13	00:23:17	I want you to search every trash can, drainage ditch, dump site between here and the city.
312	00:23:18	00:23:21	We're looking for a shovel, a purse, anything else that looks like it belonged to her.
313	00:23:26	00:23:29	Okay, Greg, diagram every rock on the pile.
314	00:23:29	00:23:33	By trial time, defense will make us recreate this whole crime scene.
315	00:24:35	00:24:37	Sleeping beauty.
316	00:25:05	00:25:07	Julie Waters.
317	00:25:10	00:25:11	Nature preserved her.
318	00:25:11	00:25:16	Loose, sandy soil, shady area, November temperatures-- it was like a freezer.
319	00:25:24	00:25:27	A girl this beautiful wouldn't zip up this far.
320	00:25:32	00:25:35	She's not wearing any makeup.
321	00:25:35	00:25:37	Maybe he cleaned her.
322	00:25:37	00:25:42	Yeah, and then he used these rocks to cover her so that she wouldn't wash up in a storm the way the other girl did.
323	00:25:42	00:25:44	What other girl?
324	00:25:44	00:25:47	We think there may be a connection to the Robyn Knight case from last year.
325	00:25:51	00:25:53	Can we prove it?
326	00:25:53	00:25:55	Well, only skeletal remains were found.
327	00:25:55	00:25:58	There's nothing definitive to connect Delhomme to the murder.
328	00:25:58	00:26:01	Then we better make this one stick.
329	00:26:05	00:26:08	You lost your bargaining chip.
330	00:26:08	00:26:09	We found her body.
331	00:26:09	00:26:11	And smart, too.
332	00:26:11	00:26:12	I advise you to remain silent.
333	00:26:15	00:26:20	Howard, just help us with one thing.
334	00:26:20	00:26:22	How did this happen?
335	00:26:22	00:26:25	You're pretty composed, Howard.
336	00:26:25	00:26:30	I mean, you kill her, you go buy a shovel, a soda.
337	00:26:30	00:26:32	It's thirsty work, digging a grave, huh?
338	00:26:32	00:26:35	That's not how it happened.
339	00:26:35	00:26:36	I understand.
340	00:26:36	00:26:39	Photographer. Model.
341	00:26:39	00:26:42	Had to get the light just right.
342	00:26:42	00:26:43	I'd like to photograph you.
343	00:26:43	00:26:48	Mmm... can't do anything until we figure this out.
344	00:26:54	00:26:56	It was an accident.
345	00:26:58	00:27:03	I wanted to move the car... and I didn't see her.
346	00:27:09	00:27:11	Why was she even there?
347	00:27:11	00:27:15	Miss Waters had modeled for my client on previous occasions.
348	00:27:15	00:27:25	Well, the problem I have with that is the dealer representative specifically stated that no model was hired to appear in the photos.
349	00:27:28	00:27:32	I was shooting... new head shots for her.
350	00:27:32	00:27:33	She was all out.
351	00:27:33	00:27:35	It was a favor.
352	00:27:35	00:27:37	I'm a professional.
353	00:27:37	00:27:39	Ask any of my models.
354	00:27:39	00:27:42	So, you took photographs of Julie?
355	00:27:42	00:27:43	A couple of rolls.
356	00:27:43	00:27:44	Any idea where they are?
357	00:27:47	00:27:49	Mmm... no.
358	00:27:49	00:27:54	Well, if you remember, let me know.
359	00:27:54	00:27:56	Okay.
360	00:28:00	00:28:03	She has no injuries consistent with a car accident.
361	00:28:03	00:28:06	Cause of death is, uh, positional asphyxia.
362	00:28:11	00:28:13	Guy we're looking at was 180-plus.
363	00:28:13	00:28:15	Sufficient weight.
364	00:28:15	00:28:19	He must have hit her, which ripped her earring out.
365	00:28:19	00:28:21	Occurred antemortem.
366	00:28:22	00:28:23	Close to time of death.
367	00:28:23	00:28:25	Only bleeding injury.
368	00:28:25	00:28:28	Was there any evidence of sexual assault?
369	00:28:28	00:28:30	Lots of trauma.
370	00:28:30	00:28:31	Collected a kit.
371	00:28:31	00:28:33	Anything else?
372	00:28:33	00:28:37	Yeah, tox came back with a blood alcohol content of .18.
373	00:28:37	00:28:43	On the day of her dinner with the producers of Real Vegas Showgirls, she'd be like Dorothy racing for Oz.
374	00:28:43	00:28:45	There's no way that she slowed down to get drunk.
375	00:28:45	00:28:48	Decomposing blood can generate ethanol postmortem.
376	00:28:48	00:28:56	As the cell walls lyse and contact with the sugar in alcohol, bacterial growth produces the byproducts of carbon dioxide and ethanol.
377	00:28:56	00:29:03	It's inexact, but the body's capable of producing somewhere around .08 grams percent on its own.
378	00:29:03	00:29:06	But in order to have a postmortem level of .18...
379	00:29:06	00:29:07	Well, she had a head start.
380	00:29:07	00:29:10	So, that's three shots in an hour?
381	00:29:10	00:29:12	He could have forced her to drink.
382	00:29:12	00:29:14	Robbins rushed the protocol.
383	00:29:14	00:29:16	Released Julie's body to her parents.
384	00:29:16	00:29:18	So they could take her home to Provo.
385	00:29:18	00:29:20	Mmm.
386	00:29:20	00:29:24	Thousands of girls come to Vegas every year just hoping to beat the odds.
387	00:29:26	00:29:27	Mmm. Some of them do.
388	00:29:27	00:29:28	And some of them don't.
389	00:29:33	00:29:35	Multiple abrasions on her cervix.
390	00:29:35	00:29:38	Sexual assault kit had no semen, no trace evidence.
391	00:29:38	00:29:42	So, it's possible he used a foreign object on her.
392	00:29:42	00:29:44	Now I'm confused.
393	00:29:44	00:29:49	Julie Waters died of positional asphyxia.
394	00:29:49	00:29:54	That means that someone sat on her chest, and...
395	00:29:54	00:29:58	two years ago, you were arrested for forced oral cop.
396	00:29:58	00:30:01	You don't think I'd ever do something like that, do you?
397	00:30:01	00:30:04	My client went to trial and was found not guilty.
398	00:30:04	00:30:05	I liked Julie.
399	00:30:05	00:30:07	I took a lot of photographs of her.
400	00:30:07	00:30:12	Even Julie's mother said that no one ever captured her on film the way I did.
401	00:30:12	00:30:17	Just one more thing from the autopsy report.
402	00:30:17	00:30:19	Julie was drinking.
403	00:30:21	00:30:23	She wanted to loosen up, you know?
404	00:30:26	00:30:28	You got what you needed.
405	00:30:28	00:30:29	Now, get what you want.
406	00:30:29	00:30:30	Come on.
407	00:30:31	00:30:33	She never said stop.
408	00:30:33	00:30:36	Why didn't you tell me this before?
409	00:30:36	00:30:40	I was afraid of what you'd think of me.
410	00:30:42	00:30:44	The sheriff has tried my client in the media.
411	00:30:44	00:30:51	But, right now, evidence that will exonerate Howard Delhomme from these false charges is being handed over to the authorities.
412	00:30:51	00:30:53	CSI Willows, you have a visitor at the front desk.
413	00:30:53	00:30:54	Willows, you have a visitor...
414	00:30:54	00:30:58	My brother sent this to me, and his attorney told me to give it to you.
415	00:30:58	00:31:00	Just set it on the counter.
416	00:31:00	00:31:03	Could you please get me a pair of gloves and an evidence bag?
417	00:31:03	00:31:05	Sure. Thanks.
418	00:31:07	00:31:09	I can show you what's in there.
419	00:31:09	00:31:10	Okay.
420	00:31:12	00:31:14	When did you get this?
421	00:31:14	00:31:16	Today.
422	00:31:16	00:31:17	It was mailed two days ago.
423	00:31:17	00:31:18	There's no return address.
424	00:31:19	00:31:21	How do you know your brother sent this?
425	00:31:21	00:31:23	That's his handwriting.
426	00:31:25	00:31:26	Was there a note in the envelope?
427	00:31:26	00:31:28	Yeah. Uh...
428	00:31:36	00:31:37	If I get arrested...
429	00:31:37	00:31:39	Now, why would he think that?
430	00:31:50	00:31:54	How are these supposed to help him beat a murder rap?
431	00:31:54	00:31:58	I'm guessing he's trying to create an alibi.
432	00:32:00	00:32:04	Four rolls, all of Julie.
433	00:32:04	00:32:07	Something's off, though.
434	00:32:07	00:32:12	White shoes, black stockings, and all ripped up.
435	00:32:12	00:32:16	Not to mention these aren't the clothes that we found her in.
436	00:32:22	00:32:24	Now, what is this?
437	00:32:24	00:32:26	It's a nude.
438	00:32:26	00:32:29	Is that Julie's body?
439	00:32:29	00:32:31	If it is, it's a double exposure.
440	00:32:31	00:32:34	I'll have to get them printed to be sure.
441	00:32:34	00:32:36	Cadet got a hit off a trash can.
442	00:32:36	00:32:37	I brought it in.
443	00:32:37	00:32:39	You want me to get Greg?
444	00:32:41	00:32:44	Archie, let me know when you've got these printed up.
445	00:32:45	00:32:46	Yeah.
446	00:33:01	00:33:02	There's a lot of head shots here.
447	00:33:05	00:33:06	Here's our little lie.
448	00:33:07	00:33:11	Delhomme said that he took her out to photograph her because she had no more head shots.
449	00:33:11	00:33:13	Needed new ones.
450	00:33:16	00:33:19	Explains how he cleaned her up.
451	00:33:23	00:33:25	Doesn't explain why.
452	00:33:26	00:33:28	Here's her day planner.
453	00:33:33	00:33:40	There's only two things written in her book the day she disappeared-- 00 p.m.
454	00:33:40	00:33:46	And the other-- Meet Howard, 00 p.m.
455	00:33:46	00:33:49	That would have given her plenty of time to get back for the producer's dinner.
456	00:33:49	00:33:51	Here's her clothes.
457	00:33:58	00:34:01	First thing you learn as a model-- bring several outfits with you.
458	00:34:01	00:34:04	You never know what the photographer might like.
459	00:34:12	00:34:13	Here's our big lie.
460	00:34:13	00:34:20	Delhomme said when she injured her earlobe, she was in her underwear and she was barefoot.
461	00:34:23	00:34:26	I think Howard's been lying to you.
462	00:34:33	00:34:36	$65? Ooh.
463	00:34:36	00:34:38	Capital investment.
464	00:34:38	00:34:41	Our victim hadn't made it to the show yet.
465	00:34:41	00:34:43	Her life was all about after the show.
466	00:34:43	00:34:48	The right guy, the right meal, and, after that...
467	00:34:48	00:34:50	It's a tough way to get ahead.
468	00:34:50	00:34:54	Did your father ever tell you you were pretty?
469	00:34:54	00:34:56	I guess.
470	00:34:56	00:34:58	He ever tell you you were smart?
471	00:34:58	00:34:59	Yeah.
472	00:34:59	00:35:03	So, it probably never occurred to you that you wouldn't be successful.
473	00:35:03	00:35:11	If all you ever hear is that you're gorgeous, you can let everything else fall away, and it can leave you in a very dangerous place.
474	00:35:13	00:35:20	All right, the bloodstain on the top of the foot is round.
475	00:35:20	00:35:22	Gravitational.
476	00:35:22	00:35:24	On the bottom of the foot, it's smeared.
477	00:35:24	00:35:25	There's no blood in these.
478	00:35:25	00:35:26	She wasn't wearing them.
479	00:35:26	00:35:33	The only way we can get this guy is if the evidence counters every one of his lies.
480	00:35:46	00:35:50	That matches the drop on the top of her stocking.
481	00:35:50	00:35:53	Separate bloodstain.
482	00:35:53	00:35:54	Separate drop.
483	00:36:07	00:36:08	She was standing.
484	00:36:16	00:36:19	And there was no one to help her.
485	00:36:21	00:36:24	This is from the fifth roll of film Delhomme took with your vic.
486	00:36:25	00:36:27	It's a double exposure.
487	00:36:27	00:36:30	It's two separate images.
488	00:36:30	00:36:32	Separate them.
489	00:36:34	00:36:37	Do you have Catherine's crime scene photos of the car?
490	00:36:37	00:36:38	Mm-hmm.
491	00:36:39	00:36:45	Just give me the instrument panel and put it side-by-side with the double-exposed instrument panel.
492	00:36:49	00:36:51	Now just the speedometers.
493	00:36:59	00:37:01	Does that look like the same car to you?
494	00:37:03	00:37:05	She looks fine here.
495	00:37:06	00:37:11	And here, it's like she's not quite sure what's going on.
496	00:37:11	00:37:14	Then here, uh...
497	00:37:15	00:37:18	She knew.
498	00:37:18	00:37:22	We have looked through every piece of evidence on this case.
499	00:37:22	00:37:25	Whatever caused these abrasions is gone.
500	00:37:25	00:37:26	Well, it's got to be here.
501	00:37:26	00:37:30	We found this guy in pieces, and he's been putting himself together ever since.
502	00:37:30	00:37:34	If we don't find something, he's going to walk out of here and forget about this like a bad dream.
503	00:37:35	00:37:37	Hey, y'all.
504	00:37:37	00:37:40	I got something on the double-exposed roll of film.
505	00:37:42	00:37:44	The odometers don't match.
506	00:37:44	00:37:46	No, on the left is you.
507	00:37:46	00:37:48	Crime scene photo from the Maserati.
508	00:37:48	00:37:49	What about the other one?
509	00:37:49	00:37:51	Well, it's unknown.
510	00:37:51	00:37:55	Must have used a picture he already had for the double exposure.
511	00:38:02	00:38:05	Guys, if it's a different car, maybe it's a different girl.
512	00:38:05	00:38:08	What's on the rest of the double-exposed roll?
513	00:38:08	00:38:10	A female body, naked.
514	00:38:10	00:38:12	No face to go with an ID.
515	00:38:12	00:38:15	Archie, do you have the SART photos from the autopsy?
516	00:38:15	00:38:16	Yeah.
517	00:38:16	00:38:18	We need to compare bodies.
518	00:38:24	00:38:27	Uh... why don't you guys take a break?
519	00:38:27	00:38:28	Uh... it's okay.
520	00:38:28	00:38:29	These photos don't bother me.
521	00:38:29	00:38:31	They bother me.
522	00:39:21	00:39:23	Well?
523	00:39:23	00:39:25	The naked pictures weren't of Julie.
524	00:39:26	00:39:29	So, what? Delhomme fakes a bunch of nude pictures and sends them to his brother?
525	00:39:29	00:39:31	At this point, I don't care why he did it.
526	00:39:31	00:39:32	What do you have?
527	00:39:32	00:39:33	Nothing.
528	00:39:33	00:39:34	Absolutely nothing.
529	00:39:34	00:39:37	If he raped her with a foreign object, it is not on this table.
530	00:39:37	00:39:41	Do you want me to leave you alone so you can do it yourself?
531	00:39:44	00:39:49	Look, the entire lab didn't need to see pictures of Julie's vagina plastered all over the screen.
532	00:39:49	00:39:52	So, Nick and I are the whole lab now?
533	00:39:52	00:39:56	That's not it, Catherine, and you know it.
534	00:39:56	00:39:58	I saw the look in Howard's eye.
535	00:39:58	00:40:01	I used to make my living off that look.
536	00:40:01	00:40:04	He wanted me. We needed him.
537	00:40:04	00:40:06	I decided to exploit that situation.
538	00:40:08	00:40:13	And, as angry as that made you, when you're in my shoes, you'll do the same thing.
539	00:40:19	00:40:22	I already checked that.
540	00:40:33	00:40:36	We're looking at the wrong evidence.
541	00:40:36	00:40:39	His initial arrest was for brandishing a firearm.
542	00:41:13	00:41:15	I fired my lawyer.
543	00:41:15	00:41:16	We waiting on a new one?
544	00:41:16	00:41:17	No.
545	00:41:19	00:41:22	Is that what you like?
546	00:41:22	00:41:24	Being alone with a woman?
547	00:41:27	00:41:29	One like you.
548	00:41:29	00:41:32	Take her out in the middle of nowhere.
549	00:41:32	00:41:34	You know, I think I got to go.
550	00:41:37	00:41:38	Howard, it's getting late. I got to go.
551	00:41:39	00:41:40	I have a meeting back in town.
552	00:41:40	00:41:42	She posed naked for me.
553	00:41:43	00:41:46	My brother gave you the pictures.
554	00:41:46	00:41:50	I never forced her to do anything.
555	00:41:50	00:41:51	You slapped her.
556	00:41:54	00:41:56	Then you violated her.
557	00:41:56	00:41:57	No more pictures.
558	00:41:58	00:42:00	No more pictures.
559	00:42:02	00:42:06	Julie Waters' cervical tissue was on your gun sight.
560	00:42:08	00:42:10	What's the matter?
561	00:42:10	00:42:14	Couldn't swallow it when you saw her all over the TV?
562	00:42:15	00:42:16	God.
563	00:42:19	00:42:21	You bitch.
564	00:42:21	00:42:23	You... bitch!
565	00:42:30	00:42:38	Prosecutors will seek a life sentence without the possibility of parole for Howard Delhomme in the murder of Julie Waters.
566	00:42:38	00:42:40	You did good, Cath.
567	00:42:40	00:42:42	I had help.
568	00:42:44	00:42:46	How are things with you and Nick and Sara?
569	00:42:46	00:42:48	They're good.
570	00:42:48	00:42:51	They're pros.
571	00:42:51	00:42:55	This case has been one of the most high-profile in this reporter's memory.
572	00:42:55	00:42:56	Never before have I seen...
573	00:42:56	00:42:58	All he had to do was stay quiet.
574	00:42:58	00:43:03	Unlike Robyn Knight, Julie Waters became Las Vegas' postmortem sweetheart.
575	00:43:03	00:43:06	...and beautiful Julie Waters...
576	00:43:06	00:43:08	The media as moral conscience.
577	00:43:10	00:43:13	She couldn't get away from him.
578	00:43:15	00:43:18	Then he couldn't get away from her.
579	00:43:18	00:43:22	I think that is why I would be perfect for your show.
580	00:43:22	00:43:24	Well, at least, that's what my dad thinks.
581	00:43:24	00:43:29	He always says, Julie, people can't help but love you.
582	00:43:31	00:43:34	And it's true.
