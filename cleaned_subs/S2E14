0	00:00:29	00:00:30	Good afternoon.
1	00:00:34	00:00:36	I need to, uh, make a withdrawal.
2	00:00:37	00:00:40	I'll n-need to see some identification.
3	00:00:52	00:00:53	There's sufficient funds in my account.
4	00:00:53	00:00:55	Just have to clear it with my manager.
5	00:00:59	00:01:01	Is that going to take long?
6	00:01:02	00:01:03	I'll be right back.
7	00:01:19	00:01:21	Is there a problem here?!
8	00:01:21	00:01:22	It's a lot of money, Mr. Logan.
9	00:01:22	00:01:24	It's going to take some time.
10	00:01:50	00:01:54	Mr. Logan, would you like an escort to your car?
11	00:02:45	00:02:47	Everything all right, sir?
12	00:02:52	00:02:54	Do you want to get that?
13	00:03:02	00:03:04	I think you should step out of the car.
14	00:03:04	00:03:05	Keep your hands where I can see them.
15	00:03:06	00:03:07	Let's go.
16	00:03:11	00:03:12	Up.
17	00:03:16	00:03:17	So how rich is this guy?
18	00:03:17	00:03:20	Well, he had a million dollars in his checking account.
19	00:03:20	00:03:21	Who doesn't?
20	00:03:21	00:03:23	He's a real estate developer.
21	00:03:23	00:03:25	On the mayor's committee to revitalize downtown.
22	00:03:25	00:03:27	And he hasn't said a word to anyone?
23	00:03:27	00:03:29	Nope. That's why we're here.
24	00:03:36	00:03:38	No... I'm not saying anything without my lawyer.
25	00:03:38	00:03:40	You don't have to say anything.
26	00:03:45	00:03:46	Mr. Logan...
27	00:03:46	00:03:49	would you please put your hands out?
28	00:03:49	00:03:50	Palms up.
29	00:04:04	00:04:05	I'm also going to need you to strip.
30	00:04:06	00:04:07	What?
31	00:04:08	00:04:10	Vegas.
32	00:04:46	00:04:47	Thank you, Mr. Logan.
33	00:04:47	00:04:49	You can put your shirt down.
34	00:04:49	00:04:50	Left arm out, please.
35	00:04:54	00:04:56	Right arm.
36	00:05:01	00:05:03	No visible injuries.
37	00:05:03	00:05:04	No blood on his clothes.
38	00:05:04	00:05:07	How long is this going to take?
39	00:05:07	00:05:09	Sorry for the inconvenience.
40	00:05:12	00:05:13	What the hell is going on here?
41	00:05:13	00:05:15	Paul, get me out of here, now.
42	00:05:15	00:05:16	Roy, put your clothes back on.
43	00:05:16	00:05:18	Don't say another word to these people.
44	00:05:18	00:05:20	I'm taking my complaint directly to the district attorney.
45	00:05:20	00:05:23	You had no grounds to detain Mr. Logan let alone disrobe him.
46	00:05:23	00:05:26	His hands were covered in blood and he had a million dollars in his briefcase.
47	00:05:26	00:05:28	It's not a crime to be rich.
48	00:05:28	00:05:29	Where's my car?
49	00:05:29	00:05:30	It's right up front.
50	00:05:30	00:05:32	My secretary drove it here.
51	00:05:32	00:05:34	You're going to be hearing from us.
52	00:05:37	00:05:41	Didn't Shakespeare say Let's kill all the lawyers?
53	00:05:41	00:05:42	Yeah. Henry VI.
54	00:05:42	00:05:44	Where is he when we need him?
55	00:05:45	00:05:48	Yeah. Hey, can you do me a favor and drop this off at the lab?
56	00:05:48	00:05:49	I'm due at a nursery rhyme recital.
57	00:05:49	00:05:52	Lindsey's going to play the girl in the moon.
58	00:05:52	00:05:52	What happen to the man in the moon?
59	00:05:52	00:05:54	He got the mumps.
60	00:06:02	00:06:05	Mr. Logan! ( car alarm chirps )
61	00:06:06	00:06:08	You forgot your sunglasses.
62	00:06:12	00:06:15	Service-oriented policing.
63	00:06:15	00:06:16	You don't understand.
64	00:06:16	00:06:18	Get away from me.
65	00:06:30	00:06:32	Hello.
66	00:06:36	00:06:37	It's for you.
67	00:06:37	00:06:39	What?
68	00:06:43	00:06:44	Hello?
69	00:06:44	00:06:47	Who are you?
70	00:06:48	00:06:49	CSI Three Willows.
71	00:06:49	00:06:50	Who are you?
72	00:06:51	00:06:54	Are you a cop?
73	00:06:54	00:06:56	Criminalist.
74	00:06:56	00:07:00	Good. Because if you had been a cop she'd already be dead.
75	00:07:00	00:07:02	Who would be dead?
76	00:07:02	00:07:03	Do you have a weapon?
77	00:07:03	00:07:05	Yes.
78	00:07:05	00:07:12	Then put it on the ground, along with your pager cell phone and that case you're holding.
79	00:07:12	00:07:13	Who is this? Do it!
80	00:07:13	00:07:16	We're watching you, CSI Three Willows.
81	00:07:16	00:07:20	Attempt to go back into the police station and we'll kill her.
82	00:07:20	00:07:23	Attempt to contact any coworkers and we'll kill her.
83	00:07:24	00:07:27	Any false moves at all, and Amanda is dead.
84	00:07:27	00:07:30	Now get back in the car.
85	00:07:30	00:07:36	You drive, anywhere but here and await my next call.
86	00:07:38	00:07:39	What did he say?
87	00:07:39	00:07:42	Is Amanda all right?
88	00:07:42	00:07:45	Let's talk in the car.
89	00:08:39	00:08:41	What'd you find?
90	00:08:41	00:08:42	The blood's female.
91	00:08:42	00:08:43	Definitely not Logan's.
92	00:08:44	00:08:45	I ran Roy Logan.
93	00:08:45	00:08:49	No criminal record; no wants; no warrants.
94	00:08:49	00:08:50	The blood on his hand was female.
95	00:08:50	00:08:52	The guy's married. He lives in Summerlin.
96	00:08:52	00:08:53	He bucks up; got a seven-year-old son.
97	00:08:53	00:08:54	But I'll check him out.
98	00:08:55	00:08:56	What about the car?
99	00:08:57	00:09:01	keep vehicle under surveillance; do not make contact with occupants.
100	00:09:01	00:09:03	You know, Catherine had a gun.
101	00:09:03	00:09:04	She could've used it.
102	00:09:12	00:09:13	You never answered my question.
103	00:09:13	00:09:14	Who's Amanda?
104	00:09:14	00:09:16	Amanda's my girlfriend.
105	00:09:18	00:09:19	I know, I know.
106	00:09:19	00:09:22	My, uh, my wife doesn't know.
107	00:09:22	00:09:23	Somebody does.
108	00:09:25	00:09:27	How did they make contact?
109	00:09:30	00:09:41	I, uh, I probably left a dozen messages for her and, um, she, uh, never called me back so I went over to the condo... to the condo and, uh...
110	00:09:41	00:09:43	this was waiting for me on the bed.
111	00:09:51	00:09:52	Got your attention.
112	00:09:52	00:09:54	My cell phone rang; it was the kidnapper.
113	00:09:54	00:09:59	He said, uh, he wanted a million dollars in cash by the end of the day, or he would...
114	00:09:59	00:10:01	he would send me the rest of her.
115	00:10:01	00:10:04	He said if I... talked to he cops...
116	00:10:04	00:10:06	Yeah, I heard that part.
117	00:10:08	00:10:10	I need a drink.
118	00:10:10	00:10:12	I can't believe you called.
119	00:10:12	00:10:14	I actually got you outside of work.
120	00:10:14	00:10:16	This is nice.
121	00:10:16	00:10:21	I don't normally date women from work but there was... something about you.
122	00:10:21	00:10:23	And it definitely wasn't your perfume.
123	00:10:24	00:10:27	I cannot believe you brought that up.
124	00:10:29	00:10:32	Yeah, that-that-that, uh, day we met that-that was, that was very gross.
125	00:10:32	00:10:33	Um...
126	00:10:33	00:10:37	I mean, not for me but for everyone else, for you.
127	00:10:44	00:10:46	Isn't that one of your coworkers?
128	00:10:46	00:10:48	Yeah.
129	00:10:50	00:10:53	We don't know how long it's going to be before he calls.
130	00:10:53	00:10:55	Why don't you order something?
131	00:10:55	00:10:57	You expect me to eat?
132	00:10:57	00:10:59	We should be in the car, waiting by the phone.
133	00:10:59	00:11:01	I have the phone.
134	00:11:01	00:11:04	relax.
135	00:11:04	00:11:06	What can I get you?
136	00:11:06	00:11:10	one with ice; one without.
137	00:11:10	00:11:10	Roy?
138	00:11:10	00:11:13	Uh, coffee. Black.
139	00:11:15	00:11:17	So, let's get to know each other.
140	00:11:17	00:11:19	You first.
141	00:11:20	00:11:23	You were born; you came home from the hospital.
142	00:11:24	00:11:25	Then what?
143	00:11:26	00:11:28	Maybe he wanted to confess.
144	00:11:28	00:11:29	Take her to the body.
145	00:11:30	00:11:32	Catherine wouldn't have left her stuff behind.
146	00:11:32	00:11:35	Hey. I sent a patrolman to Logan's house.
147	00:11:35	00:11:36	Talked to Mrs. Logan.
148	00:11:36	00:11:38	She's in perfect health.
149	00:11:38	00:11:39	She's not our vic.
150	00:11:40	00:11:41	So what do we do now?
151	00:11:41	00:11:43	We wait. Right?
152	00:11:43	00:11:46	Yeah. We don't have a crime yet.
153	00:11:49	00:11:50	Give me the finger.
154	00:12:00	00:12:01	What if somebody sees you?
155	00:12:02	00:12:04	I got to preserve this evidence.
156	00:12:15	00:12:17	Hello.
157	00:12:17	00:12:22	Take Boulder Highway south till it intersects 93.
158	00:12:22	00:12:24	Take the Yucca exit, east, one mile.
159	00:12:24	00:12:26	Horseshoe Tavern.
160	00:12:26	00:12:28	You have one hour.
161	00:12:31	00:12:32	What'd he say?
162	00:12:35	00:12:37	Let's go.
163	00:12:52	00:12:53	Is that a finger?
164	00:13:14	00:13:16	Open the briefcase. I've got an idea.
165	00:13:19	00:13:21	I use this to paint my daughter's face.
166	00:13:21	00:13:24	She was playing the moon tonight in the school play.
167	00:13:24	00:13:25	I missed it.
168	00:13:27	00:13:29	Mark the edges of the money.
169	00:13:35	00:13:37	Do you got any kids?
170	00:13:37	00:13:39	Yeah, I've got a son.
171	00:13:39	00:13:41	He's a soccer freak.
172	00:13:41	00:13:45	His life's ambition is to be Roberto Baggio.
173	00:13:47	00:13:47	Hey, there's a cop.
174	00:13:47	00:13:48	There's cop. Slow down. Come on.
175	00:13:48	00:13:50	We don't want to be pulled over.
176	00:13:50	00:13:52	If we're seen with a cop Amanda's dead.
177	00:14:00	00:14:02	Catherine didn't say anything?
178	00:14:02	00:14:04	She barely made eye contact.
179	00:14:04	00:14:05	She dropped the finger on the table and walked out.
180	00:14:05	00:14:06	Where is it?
181	00:14:06	00:14:08	Locked up at the Coroner's Lab, waiting for Dr. Robbins.
182	00:14:08	00:14:11	Unless you want me to wake him up in Kansas City.
183	00:14:11	00:14:12	Brother's wedding, back tomorrow...
184	00:14:12	00:14:13	It was the right index finger?
185	00:14:14	00:14:16	Top half severed just below the right intercostal joint.
186	00:14:16	00:14:17	Any hemorrhagic tissue?
187	00:14:17	00:14:19	Yeah, I couldn't tell. There was blood, though.
188	00:14:19	00:14:21	How did Catherine seem?
189	00:14:21	00:14:23	Like I told Nick, she completely ignored me.
190	00:14:23	00:14:25	And her behavior toward Logan?
191	00:14:25	00:14:26	Was she under duress? Agitated?
192	00:14:26	00:14:30	No... no, looked to me like Catherine was running the show.
193	00:14:30	00:14:33	A severed finger, a million bucks.
194	00:14:33	00:14:36	And Catherine's not allowed to talk to anyone.
195	00:14:36	00:14:36	Kidnapping?
196	00:14:37	00:14:39	So, who's worth one mil?
197	00:14:39	00:14:41	It's time to speak to his wife.
198	00:14:42	00:14:43	I'll call Brass.
199	00:14:43	00:14:45	It's a bit of a coincidence, don't you think?
200	00:14:45	00:14:47	Catherine just showing up at the diner.
201	00:14:47	00:14:49	It's not like she knew I was going to be there.
202	00:14:49	00:14:52	I knew.
203	00:15:01	00:15:03	That's it-- Yucca.
204	00:15:03	00:15:06	One more mile.
205	00:15:26	00:15:29	Are you crazy?
206	00:15:29	00:15:33	Sorry, it's been a while since I've driven a sports car.
207	00:15:33	00:15:34	Thanks.
208	00:16:27	00:16:29	The briefcase.
209	00:16:33	00:16:35	First we need to see Amanda.
210	00:16:35	00:16:41	Hand over the money get back in the car, and drive to a pay phone.
211	00:16:41	00:16:48	The Gas-and-Go station Highway 528, south of Henderson.
212	00:16:48	00:16:51	I will call you. I will tell you where she is.
213	00:16:51	00:16:56	No. We need something more than just your word.
214	00:16:56	00:16:57	Then she's dead.
215	00:16:57	00:16:58	No, wait!
216	00:17:07	00:17:12	The Gas-and-Go station, Highway 582, south of Henderson.
217	00:17:26	00:17:27	Mrs. Logan?
218	00:17:27	00:17:29	Yes? Uh, one minute, please.
219	00:17:29	00:17:32	Oh, come on, honey, last time you got food all over the place.
220	00:17:32	00:17:36	Your father spent a fortune detailing the car.
221	00:17:36	00:17:38	Mrs. Logan, I'm Jim Brass, Las Vegas PD.
222	00:17:38	00:17:40	This is Nick Stokes, Crime Lab.
223	00:17:40	00:17:42	Hi.
224	00:17:42	00:17:43	Have you heard from your husband?
225	00:17:44	00:17:45	No.
226	00:17:45	00:17:49	When he didn't come home last night did you find that unusual?
227	00:17:49	00:17:51	Or maybe you're used to it.
228	00:17:51	00:17:56	Look, our lawyer has advised me not to speak to the police.
229	00:17:56	00:18:00	And until I hear from Roy that's exactly what I'm going to do.
230	00:18:00	00:18:02	How about if we just have a look around?
231	00:18:02	00:18:04	I don't think so.
232	00:18:27	00:18:28	I don't see a phone.
233	00:18:31	00:18:32	Where's the phone?
234	00:18:45	00:18:48	They set us up. She's dead. I knew it!
235	00:18:48	00:18:50	He had a shotgun.
236	00:18:50	00:18:52	If all he wanted was the money, we'd both be dead.
237	00:19:07	00:19:09	Give me the phone.
238	00:19:09	00:19:11	No, no, no-- no, no! He said no phone calls.
239	00:19:11	00:19:12	They may be watch...
240	00:19:12	00:19:14	We're past that. Give me the phone!
241	00:19:14	00:19:16	Listen, please. What if it was someone you loved?
242	00:19:16	00:19:18	What if it was your daughter?!
243	00:19:21	00:19:24	The blood from the finger was diluted due to the ice.
244	00:19:24	00:19:25	But I made a positive match.
245	00:19:25	00:19:27	To the blood on Logan's hands.
246	00:19:27	00:19:29	So it was kind of like Getty's ear?
247	00:19:29	00:19:30	They cut it off, sent it to the house?
248	00:19:30	00:19:32	Wife was way too cool to have seen a severed finger.
249	00:19:32	00:19:33	I don't think so.
250	00:19:33	00:19:35	He's a real estate developer.
251	00:19:35	00:19:37	Does he own any other properties?
252	00:19:37	00:19:38	Townhouse off Flamingo.
253	00:19:38	00:19:40	Under the company name, not rented.
254	00:19:40	00:19:41	But occupied?
255	00:19:41	00:19:42	I'll get a warrant.
256	00:19:42	00:19:44	See if anybody's missing a finger over there.
257	00:19:44	00:19:46	Hey. Hey.
258	00:19:46	00:19:49	State Troopers just spotted Logan's car on the 582.
259	00:19:49	00:19:51	Drove past him earlier this morning.
260	00:19:51	00:19:53	Five minutes later, drove past him again other direction.
261	00:19:53	00:19:55	Grab Sara. We're gone.
262	00:20:22	00:20:24	Thank you, Catherine.
263	00:20:52	00:20:54	She was burning some serious rubber.
264	00:20:54	00:21:00	Definitely high-end tires-- there's colored flecks on the treads and they're fresh. It's got be Lexus.
265	00:21:03	00:21:04	Does this mean anything to you?
266	00:21:06	00:21:08	Looks like some kind of glow paint stick.
267	00:21:08	00:21:12	I think Catherine dragged her heels a little bit here.
268	00:21:12	00:21:14	Yeah.
269	00:21:16	00:21:18	Helium canister.
270	00:21:18	00:21:20	You mean like helium for balloons?
271	00:21:20	00:21:24	You can also use it to change the pitch in your voice.
272	00:21:24	00:21:26	The Lexus stopped there.
273	00:21:26	00:21:29	Catherine walked up to here.
274	00:21:29	00:21:34	So the second set of fresh tire treads on the access road could be the kidnapper's.
275	00:21:34	00:21:37	Looks like the drop-off went down.
276	00:21:37	00:21:39	Then why hasn't Catherine contacted us yet?
277	00:21:50	00:21:52	Criminalistics. Anybody home?
278	00:22:10	00:22:14	Okay... talk to me.
279	00:22:34	00:22:35	Amanda, hi, it's me, Roy.
280	00:22:35	00:22:38	Where are you? Call me on the cell.
281	00:22:45	00:22:48	Amanda, I thought you'd be home all day.
282	00:22:48	00:22:52	I wanted to swing by. Call me.
283	00:22:55	00:22:58	Amanda, it's Mark. At the gym.
284	00:22:58	00:22:59	You missed your session.
285	00:23:00	00:23:01	Call to reschedule.
286	00:23:10	00:23:12	Too bad you can't talk.
287	00:23:12	00:23:14	Maybe you could tell me where she is.
288	00:23:54	00:23:59	Well... according to the map she should be somewhere around here.
289	00:23:59	00:24:00	Amanda!
290	00:24:02	00:24:04	Amanda!
291	00:24:06	00:24:09	Why don't you give me a hand?
292	00:24:23	00:24:26	Oh, God...
293	00:24:32	00:24:34	Oh, God...
294	00:24:54	00:24:56	The finger was severed postmortem.
295	00:24:56	00:24:59	No hemorrhagic tissue at the point of injury.
296	00:24:59	00:25:01	And they used a serrated blade.
297	00:25:01	00:25:03	Jagged teeth patterns on the bone.
298	00:25:03	00:25:05	Not much else I can tell you.
299	00:25:05	00:25:06	It's just a finger.
300	00:25:10	00:25:11	Grissom.
301	00:25:12	00:25:13	Thank God.
302	00:25:14	00:25:15	There was a kidnapping.
303	00:25:15	00:25:17	I know-- Amanda Freeman.
304	00:25:17	00:25:22	She's dead... and whoever touched the money probably has glow-in-the-dark paint on their hands.
305	00:25:22	00:25:25	You got my clues?
306	00:25:25	00:25:26	Yeah, nicely done.
307	00:25:26	00:25:29	I know just about everything except...
308	00:25:29	00:25:31	where are you?
309	00:25:33	00:25:36	She ate, but she didn't fall asleep till way late.
310	00:25:36	00:25:38	We had her helping Greg go out in the lab.
311	00:25:38	00:25:40	I bet she loved that. Yeah.
312	00:25:45	00:25:48	I owe you. Thank you.
313	00:25:48	00:25:50	Oh...
314	00:26:12	00:26:14	So, you couldn't see what he looked like?
315	00:26:14	00:26:16	You're assuming it was a he.
316	00:26:16	00:26:17	Rabbit mask.
317	00:26:17	00:26:19	Full-beam headlights.
318	00:26:19	00:26:20	Truman Capote voice.
319	00:26:20	00:26:22	Who can tell gender?
320	00:26:22	00:26:23	Amanda Freeman.
321	00:26:26	00:26:30	My guess is, she's been in the water about 24 hours.
322	00:26:30	00:26:32	Washerwoman effect.
323	00:26:32	00:26:34	But no saponification.
324	00:26:41	00:26:43	Blowfly eggs?
325	00:26:44	00:26:46	Unhatched ova.
326	00:26:46	00:26:47	They're waterlogged.
327	00:26:47	00:26:49	I found some in her nose and trachea, too.
328	00:26:49	00:26:54	The decomposing body would need time to attract the bugs before submersion.
329	00:26:54	00:26:58	Well, she's been dead 48 hours 24 hours above water, 24 hours under.
330	00:26:58	00:27:00	Bloody nose, ecchymosis.
331	00:27:01	00:27:02	She took a beating.
332	00:27:02	00:27:03	Cause of death?
333	00:27:05	00:27:06	Blunt-force trauma.
334	00:27:06	00:27:06	Back of the head.
335	00:27:10	00:27:12	Look at this.
336	00:27:16	00:27:17	What is it?
337	00:27:17	00:27:19	You'll have to get it under the microscope.
338	00:27:19	00:27:21	My guess is some form of stone.
339	00:27:21	00:27:22	Granite maybe.
340	00:27:22	00:27:26	I'm going to head over to the townhouse check out those blood spots with Nick.
341	00:27:33	00:27:34	Mr. Logan?
342	00:27:34	00:27:36	I need to see her.
343	00:27:36	00:27:37	Please.
344	00:27:37	00:27:40	I wouldn't advise that.
345	00:27:40	00:27:42	Look, she...
346	00:27:42	00:27:44	was my life.
347	00:27:45	00:27:46	I loved her.
348	00:27:48	00:27:49	Please?
349	00:27:56	00:27:57	Ooh... ooh...
350	00:27:59	00:28:01	It's my fault.
351	00:28:03	00:28:04	If I'd only...
352	00:28:05	00:28:06	gotten to her sooner.
353	00:28:06	00:28:08	If I'd only paid them sooner...
354	00:28:08	00:28:09	It wouldn't have made any difference.
355	00:28:09	00:28:12	She was killed long before you could have helped her.
356	00:28:12	00:28:13	When?
357	00:28:14	00:28:15	Where?
358	00:28:15	00:28:16	You've got to give us time.
359	00:28:17	00:28:19	Why don't you go home, get some sleep?
360	00:28:23	00:28:25	I-I don't think I can face my wife right now.
361	00:28:25	00:28:27	This town is full of hotels.
362	00:28:27	00:28:29	All right.
363	00:28:29	00:28:31	You can find me at the Tangiers.
364	00:28:47	00:28:49	Marble.
365	00:28:49	00:28:51	Good to see you again.
366	00:28:51	00:28:54	Yeah, somebody hit the table.
367	00:28:54	00:28:57	There's obvious signs of a struggle.
368	00:28:57	00:28:59	Kidnapper probably broke in.
369	00:28:59	00:29:02	She made a run for it.
370	00:29:02	00:29:04	Got hit in the face.
371	00:29:04	00:29:05	Went down.
372	00:29:08	00:29:10	Blood pool here.
373	00:29:11	00:29:13	Spatter all the way to the bird.
374	00:29:13	00:29:15	Birds have blood feathers and flight feathers.
375	00:29:15	00:29:17	Flight feathers don't bleed.
376	00:29:17	00:29:20	No capillaries, just cartilage.
377	00:29:20	00:29:22	And you know this from...?
378	00:29:22	00:29:24	Discovery Channel.
379	00:29:27	00:29:30	So, how did the killer get the body out of the house?
380	00:29:32	00:29:37	There's no blood trail from here to the door, so my guess is he wrapped her in something.
381	00:29:37	00:29:39	Bedsheets? Checked.
382	00:29:39	00:29:40	Bed's still made.
383	00:29:41	00:29:42	Linen closet's full.
384	00:29:42	00:29:44	Not to mention, a wet sheet leaks.
385	00:29:44	00:29:48	Plastic, maybe.
386	00:29:48	00:29:53	If she was murdered here her finger was severed here where are the knives?
387	00:30:06	00:30:07	Clever.
388	00:30:10	00:30:12	Kidnapper washed all the knives.
389	00:30:12	00:30:15	Why wash the knives and leave the wine glasses?
390	00:30:16	00:30:19	Get those glasses to Greg.
391	00:30:40	00:30:43	Yeah, looks like someone ripped the liner out.
392	00:30:43	00:30:45	He wrapped her in it.
393	00:30:45	00:30:48	Must've gotten dumped when she did.
394	00:31:06	00:31:08	Watch your step.
395	00:31:09	00:31:10	Thank you.
396	00:31:26	00:31:28	Here we are.
397	00:31:29	00:31:31	Ran Amanda Freeman's phone records.
398	00:31:31	00:31:34	Creature of habit.
399	00:31:34	00:31:36	Mother, gym, Logan, pizza.
400	00:31:36	00:31:39	But the last call made from that house was to a cell phone we traced to Mrs. Logan.
401	00:31:39	00:31:42	Greg got saliva off the wine glasses.
402	00:31:42	00:31:45	Ran the DNA. One was Amanda, and the other a woman.
403	00:31:45	00:31:47	Mrs. Logan, maybe. They would have had a lot to talk about.
404	00:31:47	00:31:49	Or fight about.
405	00:31:59	00:32:02	Looks like a small tear.
406	00:32:09	00:32:12	Looks more like a slice.
407	00:32:12	00:32:15	Could've happened when he cut through her finger.
408	00:32:25	00:32:28	Does this look like blood to you?
409	00:32:31	00:32:35	If the body was wrapped with this side that's on the outside.
410	00:32:52	00:32:54	It's not blood.
411	00:32:54	00:32:56	Yeah.
412	00:33:03	00:33:06	This is a grease stain.
413	00:33:06	00:33:08	An oily substance.
414	00:33:23	00:33:26	Did you guys clean the table before putting the curtain on it?
415	00:33:26	00:33:28	Yeah.
416	00:33:28	00:33:30	'Cause I think your evidence got contaminated.
417	00:33:30	00:33:31	With what?
418	00:33:31	00:33:34	Oleic acid. Goes well with jelly.
419	00:33:34	00:33:35	Peanut butter.
420	00:33:37	00:33:39	Great.
421	00:33:39	00:33:40	Hey, Nick?
422	00:33:40	00:33:41	Yeah?
423	00:33:41	00:33:44	Have you been eating peanut butter in the layout room?
424	00:33:44	00:33:45	No, man, I hate the stuff.
425	00:33:45	00:33:48	Well, we found it on the back of that shower curtain.
426	00:33:52	00:33:55	Mrs. Logan scolded her son for eating in the car.
427	00:33:55	00:33:56	Peanut butter and jelly.
428	00:33:56	00:33:59	Said her husband just had the car detailed.
429	00:34:08	00:34:10	I need to take my car to this detailer.
430	00:34:10	00:34:11	Not bad.
431	00:34:11	00:34:17	Come on. You know that treating the surface with a carpet cleaner only pushes the dirt further down?
432	00:34:23	00:34:25	Warrick, you got those box cutters?
433	00:34:38	00:34:40	Did I mention how much I hate peanut butter?
434	00:34:42	00:34:44	Mrs. Logan, do you know Amanda Freeman?
435	00:34:45	00:34:49	Because she called you on your cell phone the day she was murdered.
436	00:34:49	00:34:51	Could have been a wrong number.
437	00:34:51	00:34:54	Then, uh, what did you talk about for three minutes and 55 seconds?
438	00:34:54	00:35:01	We could compel a DNA sample which would confirm that you had a glass of wine with her that night.
439	00:35:01	00:35:05	Is it your intention to charge my client with Miss Freeman's kidnapping?
440	00:35:05	00:35:12	I think you went to your husband's townhouse-- a townhouse you probably didn't know he had-- and a civilized drink turned into a violent brawl.
441	00:35:19	00:35:23	You tore down the shower curtain wrapped the body in it.
442	00:35:25	00:35:29	Cut off her finger, stuck it in a mint tin and left it for your husband.
443	00:35:29	00:35:36	You transported the body to the reservoir in the back of your SUV where some of your son's PB and J made it onto the shower curtain.
444	00:35:36	00:35:37	Are you finished?
445	00:35:37	00:35:38	Diane?
446	00:35:38	00:35:41	I had my drink with Miss Freeman.
447	00:35:41	00:35:45	I listened to her rantings about how she and Roy were getting married.
448	00:35:45	00:35:46	That's enough, Diane.
449	00:35:46	00:35:48	And I set her straight.
450	00:35:48	00:35:50	Roy was not going to leave me for her.
451	00:35:50	00:35:52	He loved his money more than both of us.
452	00:35:52	00:35:58	I told her I was going to evict her from that tacky little townhouse and then Roy came in.
453	00:35:58	00:36:01	You should have seen the look on his face.
454	00:36:02	00:36:05	And I-I left them there to work it out.
455	00:36:05	00:36:07	Okay...
456	00:36:07	00:36:09	If you don't have anything else? One more thing.
457	00:36:09	00:36:13	Mrs. Logan, can you hold your hands out palms up?
458	00:36:13	00:36:14	Jim, can you hit the lights?
459	00:36:14	00:36:17	We don't have time for these games.
460	00:36:21	00:36:22	Okay, you satisfied?
461	00:36:22	00:36:23	Whoa!
462	00:36:32	00:36:33	Look, I can explain.
463	00:36:43	00:36:49	Look, I put on a mask I made some phone calls I took the money but I did not break any laws.
464	00:36:49	00:36:51	You killed Amanda Freeman. Oh, no.
465	00:36:51	00:36:52	I didn't kill anybody.
466	00:36:52	00:36:53	I didn't even know she was dead.
467	00:36:53	00:36:54	I'm a lawyer.
468	00:36:54	00:36:55	I work for my client.
469	00:36:55	00:36:57	I did what he asked me to do.
470	00:36:57	00:36:58	Your client?
471	00:36:58	00:36:59	Roy Logan.
472	00:37:00	00:37:01	What are you saying?
473	00:37:01	00:37:03	That Mr. Logan paid you to dress up as a bunny rabbit?
474	00:37:03	00:37:05	That was my idea.
475	00:37:05	00:37:07	So, Roy Logan set this whole thing up? Yes.
476	00:37:07	00:37:09	It started with a phone call.
477	00:37:09	00:37:12	I just did what my client asked.
478	00:37:12	00:37:14	I just played a part.
479	00:37:21	00:37:25	So, basically, this was a stage play written by Mr. Logan.
480	00:37:25	00:37:27	That's right. Now you got it.
481	00:37:27	00:37:31	During this elaborate farce you never thought to ask him why he was making you jump through these hoops?
482	00:37:31	00:37:34	I don't get paid to ask. I get paid to do.
483	00:37:34	00:37:35	What about the money? A million dollars cash?
484	00:37:36	00:37:40	Well, Roy was having marital problems so I figured he was just hiding his assets.
485	00:37:40	00:37:42	Where's the money now?
486	00:37:42	00:37:43	In a locker.
487	00:37:44	00:37:45	At his country club.
488	00:37:45	00:37:46	Where did Logan say he was staying?
489	00:37:46	00:37:47	The Tangiers.
490	00:37:47	00:37:49	I'll drive.
491	00:37:49	00:37:50	I'll follow the money.
492	00:37:55	00:37:56	Mr. Logan?
493	00:37:56	00:37:58	Open the door.
494	00:37:58	00:37:59	Please.
495	00:38:31	00:38:33	I'll call down, see if his car's in the parking lot.
496	00:38:33	00:38:35	Fat chance.
497	00:38:38	00:38:40	Son of a bitch.
498	00:38:42	00:38:44	He had me completely fooled.
499	00:38:46	00:38:48	I bet that locker's empty, too.
500	00:38:54	00:38:55	Okay, let's run this.
501	00:38:55	00:39:01	Amanda was tired of being number two, so she calls up Mrs. Logan to discuss her affair with her husband.
502	00:39:04	00:39:08	But Mrs. Logan doesn't just discuss it she throws down the gauntlet.
503	00:39:08	00:39:11	He's not going to leave me for you.
504	00:39:11	00:39:12	( door opening ) He already has.
505	00:39:14	00:39:16	Amanda broke the only rule.
506	00:39:16	00:39:17	Don't call the Missus.
507	00:39:20	00:39:22	Now he really has a problem.
508	00:39:22	00:39:23	Two problems.
509	00:39:23	00:39:28	His wife is going to leave him, take half his money and he was going to jail.
510	00:39:28	00:39:30	You got to admit, his solution was ingenious.
511	00:39:30	00:39:33	Most killers take their time planning a murder.
512	00:39:33	00:39:36	He took his time covering it up.
513	00:39:37	00:39:39	48 hours to be precise.
514	00:39:49	00:39:53	So Logan cleans up the crime scene and calls his lawyer.
515	00:39:53	00:39:55	Asks him to help him with his little charade.
516	00:39:55	00:40:00	I mean, what better way to protect your assets than to pay a kidnapper who's already on retainer?
517	00:40:00	00:40:02	Everything from that point on was calculated.
518	00:40:02	00:40:11	Blood on his hands he's the last customer of the day at the bank acting suspiciously driving recklessly.
519	00:40:11	00:40:13	He knew he'd get hauled in to the cops.
520	00:40:13	00:40:15	You bet your ass.
521	00:40:15	00:40:18	He didn't leave those sunglasses behind by accident.
522	00:40:18	00:40:21	His cell phone rang on cue. The call's for me.
523	00:40:26	00:40:29	He practically forced that money into his lawyer's hands.
524	00:40:29	00:40:31	Out of one pocket into the other.
525	00:40:34	00:40:37	I especially liked the little show he did for us in the coroner's lab.
526	00:40:37	00:40:39	Trying to find out how much we knew.
527	00:40:39	00:40:41	When? Where?
528	00:40:41	00:40:42	Why make the map?
529	00:40:43	00:40:44	Why lead Catherine to the body?
530	00:40:44	00:40:48	Because without the body, Logan would always be under suspicion.
531	00:40:48	00:40:51	If not by the police, by his wife.
532	00:40:51	00:40:55	So, he left these wine glasses for you to find.
533	00:40:55	00:40:59	Sure, we wanted us to suspect the wife.
534	00:40:59	00:41:03	That's why he used her SUV to transport the body.
535	00:41:03	00:41:07	And he let me mark the money because he knew that eventually his lawyer would touch it.
536	00:41:08	00:41:09	Why though?
537	00:41:09	00:41:10	The money was in a suitcase.
538	00:41:11	00:41:12	A million dollars. Tempting.
539	00:41:12	00:41:15	I saw the locker and I saw Logan's briefcase.
540	00:41:15	00:41:17	It was too big to fit inside.
541	00:41:17	00:41:21	His lawyer had to remove the cash by hand.
542	00:41:21	00:41:24	How could he possibly know that Catherine was going to mark the money?
543	00:41:24	00:41:25	He didn't.
544	00:41:25	00:41:28	He probably thought the bank marked it.
545	00:41:28	00:41:31	Besides, there's always fingerprints.
546	00:41:31	00:41:35	So I did everything in my power to help him.
547	00:41:35	00:41:38	Yeah, and he's probably long gone by now.
548	00:41:47	00:41:49	Willows.
549	00:41:49	00:41:51	Yeah.
550	00:41:51	00:41:53	That's a beautiful car, that SC-430.
551	00:41:53	00:41:56	Don't get to see a nice car like that in these parts too often.
552	00:41:56	00:41:59	So when I see one twice in two days, I notice.
553	00:41:59	00:42:01	Especially when the driver's exceeding the speed limit.
554	00:42:12	00:42:14	Bravo.
555	00:42:22	00:42:26	You know, with all that money on my lap we could've driven to Mexico.
556	00:42:26	00:42:30	That's right. You're short one mistress.
557	00:42:34	00:42:37	I got to hand it to you that was a brilliant performance.
558	00:42:37	00:42:44	But then again, any man who juggles a wife and mistress and God knows what else has to be a pro.
559	00:42:44	00:42:45	I don't know.
560	00:42:45	00:42:49	You get so used to lying you figure, what's one more?
561	00:42:51	00:42:55	Try explaining that to your son.
