3,00:01:02,00:01:03,"Hey, you need a ride?"
4,00:01:17,00:01:18,"So, where are you headed?"
5,00:01:21,00:01:22,It's not where I'm headed.
6,00:01:22,00:01:24,(thunder crashes)
7,00:01:31,00:01:34,(indistinct radio transmissions)
8,00:01:39,00:01:41,(indistinct talking)
9,00:01:41,00:01:42,Welcome to Good Springs.
10,00:01:42,00:01:43,Long drive.
11,00:01:43,00:01:47,"Well, I know it's out of your jurisdiction but your name is on the tape."
12,00:01:47,00:01:48,Where is he?
13,00:01:48,00:01:49,Inside.
14,00:01:49,00:01:50,We left the recorder where we found it.
15,00:01:50,00:01:52,Anything else?
16,00:01:52,00:01:54,Victim's wallet.
17,00:01:55,00:01:56,Thank you.
18,00:02:04,00:02:07,"Pete Walker, California."
19,00:02:07,00:02:11,"Date of birth: August 17, 1957."
20,00:02:11,00:02:15,It's got to be the work of Paul Millander.
21,00:02:16,00:02:17,What do you think brought him back out?
22,00:02:18,00:02:19,The rain?
23,00:02:22,00:02:28,Hasn't changed his M.O.-- kills men whose birthdays are on the anniversary of his father's murder.
24,00:02:28,00:02:38,"In descending order-- first victim was August 17, 1959 second victim, August 17, 1958 this guy, 1957."
25,00:02:44,00:02:46,Ready for this?
26,00:02:46,00:02:48,I have a pretty good idea what it's going to say.
27,00:02:48,00:02:52,WALKER (anxiously): My name is Pete Walker.
28,00:02:52,00:02:57,I reside at 715 Lady Del Sol and I'm 44 years of age.
29,00:02:57,00:02:59,I'm going to kill myself.
30,00:02:59,00:03:03,"I'd like to say ""I love you"" to my mother."
31,00:03:03,00:03:06,"I'm so sorry, I never wanted to put you through this."
32,00:03:06,00:03:09,I just can't do it anymore.
33,00:03:09,00:03:12,(gunshot)
34,00:03:12,00:03:16,"MILLANDER'S VOICE: Happy... birthday, Mr. Grissom."
35,00:03:17,00:03:19,Isn't your birthday in August?
36,00:03:19,00:03:22,"August 17, 1956."
37,00:04:03,00:04:06,(indistinct radio transmissions)
38,00:04:10,00:04:11,Hey.
39,00:04:11,00:04:13,Is it true? Millander?
40,00:04:13,00:04:15,"SIDLE: Yeah, it's true."
41,00:04:15,00:04:18,"Gunshot, suicide script Leaves the body in a bathtub."
42,00:04:18,00:04:20,Paul Millander.
43,00:04:20,00:04:21,Remember the first victim?
44,00:04:21,00:04:22,Royce Harmon?
45,00:04:24,00:04:25,"Stuart Rampler, second..."
46,00:04:26,00:04:29,And now...
47,00:04:29,00:04:31,Pete Walker.
48,00:04:31,00:04:33,"Grissom, Catherine briefed us about your birth date."
49,00:04:33,00:04:35,"Yeah, what's up with that?"
50,00:04:35,00:04:39,Coincidence. Make anything more of it gives Millander more power than he deserves.
51,00:04:39,00:04:41,We work together; he can't outsmart all five of us.
52,00:04:41,00:04:43,"Yes, he can."
53,00:04:47,00:04:50,Plan of attack-- split up.
54,00:04:50,00:04:52,"Nick, take the tape over to A.V."
55,00:04:52,00:04:53,Break it down.
56,00:04:53,00:04:56,"Warrick, Sara-- examine the perimeter."
57,00:04:56,00:04:58,We need to know how he got in and got out.
58,00:04:58,00:05:00,We'll stay with the body.
59,00:05:03,00:05:04,Thanks.
60,00:05:05,00:05:06,Big night.
61,00:05:08,00:05:10,SIDLE: Rain washed awayeverything.
62,00:05:10,00:05:12,What I got will never hold up in court.
63,00:05:12,00:05:15,"Well, I got some mud prints."
64,00:05:15,00:05:16,Check these out.
65,00:05:16,00:05:18,SIDLE: This is the point of origin.
66,00:05:18,00:05:21,They stop at the warehouse threshold.
67,00:05:21,00:05:24,BROWN: He must've taken off his boots before he stepped in.
68,00:05:24,00:05:26,Only one set of prints...
69,00:05:29,00:05:31,Check out the depth of the impression compared to mine.
70,00:05:33,00:05:34,He carried the body in.
71,00:05:34,00:05:37,The extra weight explains the deeper impression.
72,00:05:39,00:05:40,Shoot it.
73,00:05:47,00:05:48,Cath...
74,00:05:49,00:05:50,"come here, take a look at this."
75,00:06:01,00:06:02,It's not lividity.
76,00:06:02,00:06:04,WILLOWS: He's got stippling on the side of his face.
77,00:06:06,00:06:08,From what I can tell he was shot once in the chest.
78,00:06:08,00:06:10,Unburned gunpowder wouldn't plume this way.
79,00:06:10,00:06:12,No entry wounds near his face.
80,00:06:16,00:06:19,I'll have Robbins check for leaks.
81,00:06:19,00:06:22,Maybe he can find a hidden bullet.
82,00:06:33,00:06:34,WILLOWS: Wait...
83,00:06:34,00:06:36,wait a minute.
84,00:06:36,00:06:38,I got something.
85,00:06:47,00:06:48,"Hello, Dolly."
86,00:06:49,00:06:51,"Dark hair, 12 inches."
87,00:06:52,00:06:54,Female?
88,00:06:54,00:06:55,So another victim...
89,00:06:55,00:06:57,or an accomplice?
90,00:06:58,00:07:00,(recorded voice): My name is Pete Walker.
91,00:07:00,00:07:02,I reside at 715 Lady Del Sol...
92,00:07:02,00:07:03,First things first.
93,00:07:03,00:07:05,This tape was not recorded in the warehouse.
94,00:07:05,00:07:07,There's no auditory echo.
95,00:07:07,00:07:08,Contained quarters.
96,00:07:08,00:07:09,"Yeah, a car, a small SUV."
97,00:07:11,00:07:12,The tape was an inch from his mouth.
98,00:07:12,00:07:14,Sibilant pops bear that out.
99,00:07:14,00:07:17,Helps that the killer uses hi-fi mini-cassettes.
100,00:07:17,00:07:18,Picks up everything ambient.
101,00:07:18,00:07:20,Let me get rid of the wipers.
102,00:07:22,00:07:24,(whirring noise)
103,00:07:24,00:07:27,"What is that, that whir sound?"
104,00:07:28,00:07:30,I don't know yet.
105,00:07:30,00:07:31,But... recognize this?
106,00:07:31,00:07:35,(country music plays)
107,00:07:35,00:07:43,"Oh, yeah. Willie Hank's ""Don't Pay the Ransom."" I'll contact the local country and western stations get a time and tape on when the song aired."
108,00:07:43,00:07:44,Establish a timeline.
109,00:07:44,00:07:45,What else?
110,00:07:45,00:07:48,"Now, here's where it gets funky."
111,00:07:48,00:07:50,Watch my sensor levels.
112,00:07:50,00:07:51,WALKER: My name is Pete Walker.
113,00:07:51,00:07:55,I reside at... See how the color wands gravitate towards the bottom right corner?
114,00:07:55,00:07:56,Mm-hmm.
115,00:07:56,00:07:57,There's an auditory imbalance.
116,00:07:57,00:07:58,"From what, a blown speaker?"
117,00:07:58,00:08:01,A blownleftspeaker.
118,00:08:01,00:08:02,Sounds like the driver's side one blew.
119,00:08:02,00:08:05,Pulling all of the sound bottom right.
120,00:08:05,00:08:10,Now if that were true the victim may have been sitting in the passenger seat.
121,00:08:10,00:08:12,What does that get you?
122,00:08:12,00:08:15,Millander was driving.
123,00:08:15,00:08:18,I believe hitchhiking is illegal in Clark County.
124,00:08:18,00:08:20,"Yeah, you got me."
125,00:08:20,00:08:25,Came with the car along with the registration.
126,00:08:25,00:08:27,The R.O.'s our vic Pete Walker.
127,00:08:27,00:08:29,Who flagged it?
128,00:08:29,00:08:31,Nevada State Patrol.
129,00:08:31,00:08:32,"So, this is Walker's car."
130,00:08:33,00:08:34,Millander was hitchhiking.
131,00:08:34,00:08:37,Guy stops to do a favor...
132,00:08:37,00:08:38,ends up dead.
133,00:08:38,00:08:44,"Yeah, but how would Millander know that the guy who'd pick him up had a birthday August 17, 1957?"
134,00:08:50,00:08:52,There's the initial bullet hole.
135,00:08:53,00:08:54,No other leaks.
136,00:08:54,00:09:00,Died from a single gunshot wound to the chest just like the others.
137,00:09:00,00:09:03,The others didn't have stippling on the side of their faces.
138,00:09:04,00:09:07,Unburned gunpowder doesn't change direction and stick.
139,00:09:11,00:09:13,Unless...
140,00:09:15,00:09:19,he turned his face away from the gun.
141,00:09:19,00:09:23,Not likely due to the origin of the facial burn.
142,00:09:23,00:09:25,(gunshot)
143,00:09:25,00:09:27,Nobody misses from this distance.
144,00:09:27,00:09:29,True.
145,00:09:29,00:09:32,GRISSOM: I think this might be intentional.
146,00:09:32,00:09:44,"I-I-I call it ""Good Versus Evil."" He's telling me he's going to show me both sides."
147,00:09:55,00:09:57,BROWN: I found some G.S.R.
148,00:10:00,00:10:01,SIDLE: Nice.
149,00:10:08,00:10:10,That's why Grissom didn't find a bullet.
150,00:10:10,00:10:12,It went out the window.
151,00:10:12,00:10:14,It went out the window.
152,00:10:14,00:10:17,I'm so sorry. I never wanted to put you through this.
153,00:10:17,00:10:20,I just can't do it anymore.
154,00:10:20,00:10:21,I've lost hope.
155,00:10:24,00:10:33,"I'm going to call Nick, tell him we found out what that unidentified whir sound was-- the window going down."
156,00:10:34,00:10:35,SANDERS: Your planted hair is full of information.
157,00:10:36,00:10:39,It's got a complete follicular tag.
158,00:10:39,00:10:42,"Well, the vic had light brown hair so we know it's not his."
159,00:10:42,00:10:44,Could be Millander's.
160,00:10:44,00:10:47,"Well, that's impossible."
161,00:10:47,00:10:52,The amelogenin on the follicle came back XX-- female.
162,00:10:52,00:10:54,"So, back to that again."
163,00:10:54,00:10:56,"Another victim, or an accomplice?"
164,00:10:56,00:10:58,"Yeah, but what decade?"
165,00:10:58,00:11:00,What do you mean?
166,00:11:00,00:11:03,Look under 400-X.
167,00:11:03,00:11:05,The tag cell is aged.
168,00:11:10,00:11:12,So Millander planted an aged hair?
169,00:11:12,00:11:17,"But once exposed, the tag would dry up and fall off, especially in transport."
170,00:11:17,00:11:20,Not if he nurtured it kept it in a freezer.
171,00:11:20,00:11:23,That would work.
172,00:11:23,00:11:26,"WILLOWS: Okay, so what's he trying to tell us?"
173,00:11:26,00:11:28,That he used to kill women?
174,00:11:28,00:11:31,Maybe just one.
175,00:11:31,00:11:33,Grounds?
176,00:11:34,00:11:36,I don't know yet.
177,00:12:11,00:12:14,Is this the car the guy was killed in?
178,00:12:14,00:12:18,He was killed in the warehouse-- and don't sneak up on a person like that.
179,00:12:18,00:12:21,"Now you know how I feel, like ten times a day."
180,00:12:21,00:12:23,So what's this Millander guy's thing?
181,00:12:23,00:12:28,He saw his dad killed when he was a kid over some money dispute.
182,00:12:28,00:12:31,Ends up killing guys himself.
183,00:12:33,00:12:34,Check that out.
184,00:12:34,00:12:37,An eight digit number with a dash.
185,00:12:37,00:12:40,Pep Boys receipt? Dry cleaning tags?
186,00:12:40,00:12:43,"Well, whatever it is it happened during the summer."
187,00:12:43,00:12:47,Paper only burns itself into plastic in high levels of heat.
188,00:12:47,00:12:52,So what kind of paper item would you shove into the center console in the heat of summer?
189,00:12:52,00:12:55,Something you didn't want.
190,00:12:55,00:12:59,Or something you had to keep.
191,00:12:59,00:13:02,(pager ringing)
192,00:13:04,00:13:06,Powwow.
193,00:13:06,00:13:07,Later.
194,00:13:07,00:13:11,Nevada State Patrol found the victim's vehicle here.
195,00:13:11,00:13:14,Found the body in Good Springs here.
196,00:13:14,00:13:18,Warrick and I found stippling on the passenger side seat back.
197,00:13:18,00:13:24,"WARRICK: We were thinking Millander posed as a hitchhiker overpowered Walker, and then faked a gunshot in the car."
198,00:13:26,00:13:28,I put a call into three area country and western stations.
199,00:13:28,00:13:30,Got the FCC list for each.
200,00:13:30,00:13:39,"During the time of the victim's suicide recording KWV had Willie Hank's ""Don't Pay the Ransom"" playing from 1:47 a.m. to 1:51 a.m."
201,00:13:39,00:13:41,And what time was sunrise this morning?
202,00:13:41,00:13:43,5:13 a.m.
203,00:13:43,00:13:44,So that's about a three hour window.
204,00:13:44,00:13:45,He was racing daylight.
205,00:13:45,00:13:49,WILLOWS: So in that time he had to get the recording and get rid of the body.
206,00:13:49,00:13:51,Made the recording in the car killed him in the warehouse.
207,00:13:52,00:13:55,"No, he carried him into the warehouse."
208,00:13:55,00:13:55,Yeah?
209,00:13:55,00:13:58,"Mud prints-- one set in, one set out."
210,00:13:59,00:14:03,Are we sure he didn't kill him in the car?
211,00:14:03,00:14:05,He was shot in the warehouse.
212,00:14:05,00:14:08,He was incapacitated in the car.
213,00:14:08,00:14:10,"SIDLE: Okay, how?"
214,00:14:11,00:14:14,"Grissom, you want to add something to this?"
215,00:14:16,00:14:20,Yeah. None of it matters.
216,00:14:20,00:14:25,It's one of those few cases where physical evidence isn't helping us much.
217,00:14:25,00:14:27,"I mean, put it in context."
218,00:14:27,00:14:31,The victim's birthday is always on the anniversary of the murder of Millander's father.
219,00:14:31,00:14:33,Staged like his father's death.
220,00:14:33,00:14:39,A planted hair a planted fingerprint It's all biographical.
221,00:14:40,00:14:43,He's using the evidence to tell us a story.
222,00:14:43,00:14:44,Hey...
223,00:14:44,00:14:50,"Peter Walker, our victim worked for Cinema Road Services in Valencia, California."
224,00:14:50,00:14:54,Drives the newly released film reels back and forth to Vegas.
225,00:14:54,00:14:57,Drops off the new reels every Tuesday for Friday's release.
226,00:14:57,00:14:59,Brings the old one back.
227,00:14:59,00:15:01,Drives the same route all the time?
228,00:15:01,00:15:02,"Yeah, according to his mileage log."
229,00:15:02,00:15:05,Did Walker have any kind of record?
230,00:15:05,00:15:09,BRASS: Pretty much a boy scout except for a speeding ticket.
231,00:15:09,00:15:11,Speeding ticket? How long ago?
232,00:15:11,00:15:14,"July 2, last year."
233,00:15:16,00:15:18,Summer.
234,00:15:18,00:15:22,909987-23...
235,00:15:25,00:15:26,Pete Walker.
236,00:15:26,00:15:27,Excessive speed.
237,00:15:28,00:15:30,"July 2, 2001."
238,00:15:30,00:15:32,Walker's birth date's on the ticket.
239,00:15:32,00:15:33,"August 17, 1957."
240,00:15:33,00:15:34,Run the other two vics.
241,00:15:34,00:15:35,Royce Harmon.
242,00:15:37,00:15:40,WILLOWS: Employment-- Dinners Delivered.
243,00:15:41,00:15:42,Need a car for that.
244,00:15:42,00:15:44,"What about his driving record, Jim?"
245,00:15:48,00:15:50,He drove himself right out of a license.
246,00:15:51,00:15:53,Try Stuart Rampler.
247,00:15:53,00:15:57,STOKES: There's a few tickets.
248,00:15:57,00:15:59,"Last violation-- excessive speed, June, 2000."
249,00:15:59,00:16:01,So what's the commonality?
250,00:16:01,00:16:03,Besides birth dates.
251,00:16:03,00:16:05,Besides birth dates...
252,00:16:07,00:16:10,BRASS: All the tickets were written by the same cop.
253,00:16:15,00:16:17,Excuse me.
254,00:16:17,00:16:20,Officer Yarnell?
255,00:16:20,00:16:22,Yeah.
256,00:16:22,00:16:25,"My name's Gil Grissom, with the Las Vegas Crime Lab."
257,00:16:25,00:16:29,May I ask you how many speeding tickets you issue a day?
258,00:16:29,00:16:31,Why is it any business of yours?
259,00:16:31,00:16:34,You wrote tickets to three people who ended up dead.
260,00:16:34,00:16:36,You think I had something to do with it?
261,00:16:38,00:16:39,"Look, I'm a good cop."
262,00:16:39,00:16:40,I protect and serve.
263,00:16:40,00:16:42,I even go to court on my days off.
264,00:16:42,00:16:45,You mean court dates for speeding tickets?
265,00:16:45,00:16:49,"Yeah. Sometimes, believe it or not people actually contest them and I'm there fighting it tooth and nail."
266,00:16:49,00:16:50,Court.
267,00:16:50,00:16:51,Yeah.
268,00:16:51,00:16:54,"In fact, I just responded to a challenge this morning."
269,00:16:54,00:16:55,Always the same judge?
270,00:16:55,00:16:58,"No, there's three traffic court judges."
271,00:16:58,00:16:59,Session's about to start.
272,00:16:59,00:17:00,Why don't you go bother them.
273,00:17:03,00:17:05,All rise.
274,00:17:05,00:17:08,Honorable Judge Douglas Mason presiding...
275,00:17:08,00:17:13,"Municipal Court, City of Mulberry State of Nevada."
276,00:17:31,00:17:33,You may be seated.
277,00:17:47,00:17:48,Gil.
278,00:17:53,00:17:54,"Excuse me, Officer."
279,00:17:54,00:17:55,I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
280,00:17:55,00:17:57,I need you to arrest a murder suspect.
281,00:17:57,00:17:59,Where's the suspect?
282,00:17:59,00:18:01,Judge Mason.
283,00:18:01,00:18:02,His real name is Paul Millander.
284,00:18:03,00:18:04,You don't want to do this.
285,00:18:05,00:18:07,"Sir, please take a seat."
286,00:18:08,00:18:11,"Officer, this man is not who he's pretending to be."
287,00:18:11,00:18:15,Take a seat now or I'll have you removed from this courtroom and charged with contempt.
288,00:18:15,00:18:17,He's wanted in Clark County for murder.
289,00:18:17,00:18:19,You are now in contempt of court. Bailiff?
290,00:18:19,00:18:20,Come on.
291,00:18:21,00:18:22,I apologize for the disruption.
292,00:18:22,00:18:25,Let's proceed.
293,00:18:25,00:18:26,"You may be seated, miss."
294,00:18:26,00:18:31,You can leave this court when it has concluded its business.
295,00:18:34,00:18:37,Or find yourself in contempt along with your friend.
296,00:18:48,00:18:51,Where are you from?
297,00:18:51,00:18:53,You know where I'm from...
298,00:18:53,00:18:55,and I know who you are.
299,00:18:55,00:18:58,I'm not who you think I am.
300,00:18:58,00:19:02,"Local police have been out here twice this past year about this man-- Paul Millander, is it?"
301,00:19:02,00:19:06,Every time his story's in the paper.
302,00:19:06,00:19:08,I've heard I look like him.
303,00:19:08,00:19:10,Identical.
304,00:19:10,00:19:12,You've heard of the Doppelganger Syndrome?
305,00:19:13,00:19:18,That every person is supposed to have an exact double somewhere in the world?
306,00:19:18,00:19:20,Do you believe in it?
307,00:19:20,00:19:21,Never been proved.
308,00:19:21,00:19:27,A Swiss neurobiologist recently published papers supporting its viability.
309,00:19:27,00:19:29,"Brugger, I think his name is."
310,00:19:29,00:19:33,Stands to reason this Millander is my doppelganger.
311,00:19:33,00:19:37,The monkey wrench for you is that we're both here in the state of Nevada.
312,00:19:39,00:19:43,"Well, you know, we could always do a DNA test."
313,00:19:44,00:19:50,"You know, if you keep that up people are going to start calling you crazy."
314,00:19:50,00:19:52,Guard.
315,00:19:56,00:20:00,I trust you won't go near my courtroom again.
316,00:20:04,00:20:07,Before you go back to Las Vegas why don't you come to dinner.
317,00:20:07,00:20:14,I tell my wife stories about my day and this one she may need to hear in person.
318,00:20:15,00:20:17,6:00.
319,00:20:17,00:20:19,That's my address.
320,00:20:19,00:20:22,We live right here in Mulberry.
321,00:20:36,00:20:39,Any chance he's got a twin?
322,00:20:39,00:20:41,"A doppelganger, evidently."
323,00:20:41,00:20:43,Do you have your mentholatum?
324,00:20:43,00:20:44,"Why, you getting a cold?"
325,00:20:44,00:20:45,No.
326,00:20:45,00:20:47,The judge just got sloppy.
327,00:20:47,00:20:48,Thanks.
328,00:20:51,00:20:53,"Ah, fuming."
329,00:20:53,00:20:57,I'll lift it and get it to the lab.
330,00:20:57,00:20:58,Go ahead and take the Tahoe.
331,00:20:58,00:20:58,Call me later.
332,00:20:59,00:21:00,I'm going to dinner.
333,00:21:04,00:21:08,"Greg, did you look at the female hair from the crime scene tub?"
334,00:21:08,00:21:14,"When you say ""jump,"" I say ""how high?"" I found testosterone in female hair."
335,00:21:14,00:21:16,Post pubescent female hair.
336,00:21:16,00:21:19,"Well, men and women both have testosterone in their systems."
337,00:21:19,00:21:21,"No big deal, right?"
338,00:21:21,00:21:22,"Well, this is."
339,00:21:22,00:21:25,This testosterone's endogenous.
340,00:21:25,00:21:26,What? What do you mean?
341,00:21:26,00:21:28,Like outside the body?
342,00:21:28,00:21:30,Injections. Supplements.
343,00:21:31,00:21:35,So our mystery lady was trying to enhance her athletic performance?
344,00:21:35,00:21:39,Or increase her sex drive.
345,00:21:39,00:21:40,You know women do that.
346,00:21:42,00:21:43,I read.
347,00:21:43,00:21:45,None that I've ever met.
348,00:21:45,00:21:46,Not yet anyway.
349,00:21:46,00:21:50,"Okay, I'm not sure what this means yet, but thanks."
350,00:22:15,00:22:17,(rings doorbell)
351,00:22:31,00:22:32,Mr. Grissom?
352,00:22:33,00:22:37,I was admiring these rain boots.
353,00:22:37,00:22:39,Please come in.
354,00:22:44,00:22:46,(violin music playing)
355,00:22:51,00:22:52,You have a lovely home.
356,00:22:53,00:22:54,We like it.
357,00:22:55,00:22:57,May I ask how long you've lived here?
358,00:22:57,00:23:02,We bought the year we adopted Craig so that would be '92.
359,00:23:03,00:23:09,"Craig, what did I tell you you had to do when our dinner guest arrived?"
360,00:23:09,00:23:11,"Hi, I'm Craig Mason. Nice to meet you."
361,00:23:11,00:23:13,"Nice to meet you, Craig."
362,00:23:13,00:23:16,Want an I.D. tag for safety?
363,00:23:16,00:23:20,Craig's school is sponsoring an identification program for students.
364,00:23:20,00:23:22,"Parents get one, too."
365,00:23:22,00:23:26,"Can't be too safe out there, can we, Mr. Grissom?"
366,00:23:26,00:23:29,"No, we can't."
367,00:23:29,00:23:31,Hungry?
368,00:23:34,00:23:35,"That reminds me, Doug."
369,00:23:35,00:23:38,Be sure to tell Mr. Grissom where you bought your rain boots.
370,00:23:38,00:23:40,He was admiring them earlier.
371,00:23:40,00:23:41,Was he?
372,00:23:41,00:23:47,"My husband's only hobby is driving around the state looking for bargains, rain or shine."
373,00:23:47,00:23:49,"And I tell him, ""You're a judge now."
374,00:23:49,00:23:56,"We don't need bargains."" To which I reply, ""Old habits die hard."" Truth is I think he just enjoys his private time."
375,00:23:58,00:23:59,Dear.
376,00:24:01,00:24:07,As a judge I don't want the outside world privy to my private life because they'll use it against me.
377,00:24:11,00:24:12,You'll be safe now.
378,00:24:12,00:24:14,(typing)
379,00:24:21,00:24:22,(beeping)
380,00:24:30,00:24:31,(phone rings)
381,00:24:31,00:24:33,Excuse me. I'm sorry.
382,00:24:36,00:24:38,Grissom.
383,00:24:38,00:24:42,You're never going to believe who Judge Mason's fingerprints match.
384,00:24:42,00:24:43,Judge Mason.
385,00:24:43,00:24:48,As printed when he was sworn before the bar Nevada State Superior Court.
386,00:24:48,00:24:51,Okay.
387,00:24:51,00:24:52,Thank you.
388,00:24:55,00:24:57,My prints came back sound.
389,00:24:59,00:25:00,Douglas?
390,00:25:00,00:25:04,"As I told you earlier, dear Mr. Grissom has confused me with a very bad man."
391,00:25:04,00:25:09,I left him fingerprints so that he could confirm that I am who I say I am.
392,00:25:14,00:25:17,"Uh, I have to get back to my lab right away."
393,00:25:17,00:25:18,I'm sorry.
394,00:25:18,00:25:19,"Thank you for a lovely dinner, Mrs. Mason."
395,00:25:19,00:25:22,Craig...
396,00:25:23,00:25:24,Your Honor.
397,00:25:26,00:25:31,I don't care what the computer says that guy is Paul Millander.
398,00:25:31,00:25:34,"Yeah, we know that. How do we prove it?"
399,00:25:34,00:25:36,We have to disprove this Judge Mason.
400,00:25:36,00:25:38,Birth certificate-- was he born in Mulberry?
401,00:25:38,00:25:41,"Well, that's the first thing Brass looked into."
402,00:25:41,00:25:44,"Apparently, the records building burned down in 1982."
403,00:25:44,00:25:45,Burned down?
404,00:25:45,00:25:47,Ruled arson. No suspects ever found.
405,00:25:47,00:25:50,So Judge Mason has no birth certificate.
406,00:25:50,00:25:51,How convenient.
407,00:25:51,00:25:54,"Man, this guy plays way out in front."
408,00:25:54,00:25:55,Here's some good news.
409,00:25:55,00:25:58,Brass went to the new records building looking for anything on a Millander.
410,00:25:58,00:26:01,Found current property-tax accounts.
411,00:26:03,00:26:07,In the name of Paul and Isabelle Millander.
412,00:26:07,00:26:09,Mm-hmm.
413,00:26:28,00:26:29,Isabelle Millander?
414,00:26:32,00:26:34,We're with the Las Vegas crime lab.
415,00:26:34,00:26:36,Are you here about my husband?
416,00:26:36,00:26:38,That happened over 30 years ago.
417,00:26:42,00:26:48,It's our understanding that your child witnessed your husband's murder.
418,00:26:51,00:26:53,Thank you.
419,00:26:55,00:26:57,My child was only ten years old.
420,00:26:57,00:27:00,So brave to testify against those men.
421,00:27:00,00:27:01,But it didn't matter.
422,00:27:01,00:27:05,The judge ruled it a suicide and those men went free.
423,00:27:05,00:27:06,I hope we're not interrupting.
424,00:27:06,00:27:09,It looks as if you're expecting someone for dinner.
425,00:27:09,00:27:13,I always set an extra place for Paul.
426,00:27:13,00:27:14,Your son?
427,00:27:14,00:27:16,My husband.
428,00:27:16,00:27:17,My way of being together.
429,00:27:23,00:27:25,Those are from his best years.
430,00:27:25,00:27:29,He started a company out in Hollywood in the 1930s.
431,00:27:30,00:27:32,GRISSOM: Halloweird.
432,00:27:32,00:27:36,Movie makeup. He used himself as a model.
433,00:27:36,00:27:40,"He made hand molds and masks, everything."
434,00:27:40,00:27:42,Like a one-man company.
435,00:27:42,00:27:44,May I use your bathroom?
436,00:27:44,00:27:45,Last door down the hall.
437,00:27:45,00:27:49,Would you happen to have any of his work still?
438,00:27:50,00:27:53,I kept only what's most sentimental.
439,00:27:53,00:27:56,Might I take a look at it?
440,00:28:53,00:28:57,"Hmm, it's rudimentary."
441,00:28:57,00:28:59,Almost childlike.
442,00:28:59,00:29:01,Our child made it.
443,00:29:01,00:29:03,It's an ashtray?
444,00:29:04,00:29:08,My husband used his own hand to imprint the center.
445,00:29:10,00:29:11,May I?
446,00:29:20,00:29:23,I wonder what this green discoloration is.
447,00:29:24,00:29:27,I was often curious about that.
448,00:29:27,00:29:29,I could take this back to the lab and analyze it.
449,00:29:30,00:29:33,I promise to bring it back.
450,00:30:16,00:30:19,What are you doing in my daughter's room?
451,00:30:19,00:30:22,Oh...
452,00:30:22,00:30:25,I have a daughter myself.
453,00:30:25,00:30:28,I was admiring the old clothes.
454,00:30:28,00:30:29,She's beautiful.
455,00:30:33,00:30:36,She died.
456,00:30:36,00:30:38,I'm sorry.
457,00:30:39,00:30:40,When did she die?
458,00:30:41,00:30:45,A long time ago.
459,00:30:45,00:30:48,A lifetime ago.
460,00:30:49,00:30:53,What about your son Paul?
461,00:30:53,00:30:55,I think it's time for you to go now.
462,00:30:55,00:30:58,Mrs. Millander we're just trying to clarify...
463,00:30:58,00:31:00,Please?
464,00:31:07,00:31:10,"So, Paul Millander killed his sister."
465,00:31:10,00:31:13,It's plausible.
466,00:31:13,00:31:15,It's not provable...
467,00:31:15,00:31:17,yet.
468,00:31:28,00:31:30,"SANDERS: No, you were right."
469,00:31:30,00:31:35,The substanceisMicrocil-like but it's really old-school-- alginate.
470,00:31:35,00:31:37,"The book says that, uh..."
471,00:31:37,00:31:42,makeup people used it up to the '70s to make molds and impressions.
472,00:31:42,00:31:49,"It's green, hence the ""algin"" in ""alginate."" We sold 10,000 of those units last Halloween. Even used my own hand for the mold."
473,00:31:49,00:31:52,These were his father's prints.
474,00:31:52,00:31:55,He was planting them as if they were his own.
475,00:32:00,00:32:03,SANDERS: The guy's pretty shrewd.
476,00:32:03,00:32:05,Every murder comes back to a dead man.
477,00:32:05,00:32:11,"Greg, if I refer to Millander as smart, it's one thing but I mind if other people do it, okay?"
478,00:32:11,00:32:13,Got it.
479,00:32:13,00:32:15,What have you got on the hair Catherine recovered?
480,00:32:16,00:32:17,"Processing it next, sir."
481,00:32:18,00:32:19,Find me.
482,00:32:24,00:32:27,Did I miss something?
483,00:32:27,00:32:29,It's a kid's fingerprint from the baseball card.
484,00:32:29,00:32:31,GRISSOM: Clear...
485,00:32:31,00:32:33,Concise...
486,00:32:33,00:32:34,Anonymous.
487,00:32:34,00:32:39,"Brass found no prints from little Pauline no birth records, no death certificate."
488,00:32:39,00:32:44,I'm going to use the prints from the only other kid who lived in the Millander house.
489,00:32:44,00:32:46,Here come de judge.
490,00:32:50,00:32:53,Ridge analysis proof.
491,00:32:53,00:32:54,Judge Masonis...
492,00:32:54,00:32:56,Paul Millander.
493,00:32:56,00:32:57,(beeping)
494,00:33:00,00:33:02,It's...
495,00:33:02,00:33:03,It's Greg.
496,00:33:03,00:33:05,Come on.
497,00:33:12,00:33:13,Okay.
498,00:33:13,00:33:18,The hair you found in Pauline Millander's bedroom Two X chromosomes-- female.
499,00:33:18,00:33:19,You didn't beep me for that.
500,00:33:19,00:33:24,"Well, Sara had me compare it to the hair found in the tub at the crime scene."
501,00:33:24,00:33:25,They're a perfect match.
502,00:33:25,00:33:28,DNA identical.
503,00:33:28,00:33:31,So her brother planted it?
504,00:33:31,00:33:34,Well... not exactly.
505,00:33:34,00:33:36,"Yeah, he planted it."
506,00:33:36,00:33:37,He planted his own hair.
507,00:33:37,00:33:39,Millander.
508,00:33:39,00:33:42,It's a female hair.
509,00:33:42,00:33:44,With endogenous testosterone.
510,00:33:44,00:33:47,Pauline was taking male hormone injections.
511,00:33:49,00:33:50,Why?
512,00:33:50,00:33:52,My theory?
513,00:33:52,00:33:54,Sex change.
514,00:33:54,00:34:01,"You know, when I was back at the house I saw several photographs of Pauline and nothing of Paul."
515,00:34:01,00:34:06,"In fact, the only proof of Paul is a hidden baseball card."
516,00:34:08,00:34:10,There is no birth or death record for Pauline.
517,00:34:10,00:34:12,Paul killed Pauline.
518,00:34:13,00:34:15,But he didn't murder her.
519,00:34:15,00:34:17,So that's what you've been hiding?
520,00:34:17,00:34:20,That your daughter is now your son?
521,00:34:20,00:34:23,Pauline went away and came back a very strange man.
522,00:34:36,00:34:39,And I wouldn't let him stay here-- not like that.
523,00:34:39,00:34:51,"Mrs. Millander, we believe that your son has murdered three people and that he's living under the assumed name of Judge Douglas Mason."
524,00:34:51,00:34:57,I need your permission to collect some hairs from Pauline's bedroom for use in court.
525,00:35:01,00:35:07,We took this hair from your childhood bedroom when you used to be Pauline.
526,00:35:10,00:35:21,"They told my parents I had an ""endocrinic ambiguity."" My chromosomes said female, but my body wasn't that sure."
527,00:35:21,00:35:26,The doctors told my parents to raise me as they saw fit.
528,00:35:30,00:35:33,"Unfortunately, they disagreed."
529,00:35:37,00:35:39,"So, uh..."
530,00:35:39,00:35:45,You were a girl when you were inside the house and a boy when you were out in the world?
531,00:35:46,00:35:47,I managed.
532,00:35:50,00:35:51,Until...
533,00:35:53,00:35:54,that night.
534,00:36:02,00:36:03,(gunshot)
535,00:36:11,00:36:12,A boy...
536,00:36:15,00:36:17,couldhave saved his father.
537,00:36:19,00:36:22,You did what you could do.
538,00:36:22,00:36:23,You testified against them.
539,00:36:25,00:36:28,Do you see the man who killed your father in this courtroom?
540,00:36:31,00:36:34,Y... Yes.
541,00:36:39,00:36:41,They went free.
542,00:36:41,00:36:45,And you started to identify with the aggressors.
543,00:36:50,00:36:52,Why are you smiling?
544,00:36:54,00:36:55,I am...
545,00:36:56,00:37:00,comfortable sharing this with you.
546,00:37:02,00:37:03,"My, uh..."
547,00:37:05,00:37:08,My mother wouldn't hear it.
548,00:37:09,00:37:13,Against her wishes I cut off my hair.
549,00:37:13,00:37:15,Started wearing big shirts.
550,00:37:15,00:37:18,Big boots.
551,00:37:20,00:37:23,If I got tough enough...
552,00:37:23,00:37:26,No one would ever hurt me.
553,00:37:26,00:37:29,I went to the clinic...
554,00:37:29,00:37:31,and became a man.
555,00:37:31,00:37:33,Sexual reassignment.
556,00:37:33,00:37:36,"Not just a man, though-- a judge."
557,00:37:36,00:37:43,"Doesn't get much more powerful than that but none of it solved your problems, did it?"
558,00:37:43,00:37:46,Or else you wouldn't have killed three innocent men.
559,00:37:53,00:37:55,I have a warrant for your DNA.
560,00:37:59,00:38:01,"Identity is so fluid, you know."
561,00:38:06,00:38:07,May I?
562,00:38:27,00:38:29,See you in court.
563,00:38:29,00:38:33,Aren't you wondering about your birthday?
564,00:38:33,00:38:35,"August 17, 1956."
565,00:38:35,00:38:37,No.
566,00:38:37,00:38:40,"Why I didn't kill you, since you were next?"
567,00:38:40,00:38:41,No.
568,00:38:41,00:38:45,"I've already picked my next victim, if you're curious."
569,00:38:46,00:38:50,"It doesn't matter, Paul-- you'll be in jail."
570,00:39:04,00:39:06,"Next up,People v. Landry."
571,00:39:06,00:39:08,Are all the parties present?
572,00:39:09,00:39:10,What is going on?
573,00:39:10,00:39:13,I thought Millander was supposed to be arraigned at 8:00.
574,00:39:13,00:39:14,This is just ridiculous.
575,00:39:14,00:39:17,"I mean, you'd think they'd make an exception in this case-- three murders."
576,00:39:17,00:39:20,This guy's telling me that Millander is representing himself.
577,00:39:20,00:39:23,Pro pers are always last on the docket.
578,00:39:52,00:39:57,BRASS: A clean-cut guy in a suit-- no one looks too close.
579,00:39:57,00:40:00,He must have got a fake I.D.
580,00:40:00,00:40:02,He hadmyI.D.
581,00:40:19,00:40:20,You going home?
582,00:40:20,00:40:22,Yeah. They know where to find me.
583,00:40:22,00:40:25,I re-read the backgrounds of Millander's victims.
584,00:40:25,00:40:27,I think that he slipped up.
585,00:40:27,00:40:34,"You know how every victim read the suicide note ""I'd like to say 'I love you' to my mother""?"
586,00:40:34,00:40:36,"Well, Pete Walker had no mother."
587,00:40:36,00:40:37,She died in childbirth.
588,00:40:40,00:40:42,He never slips up.
589,00:41:41,00:41:43,Mrs. Millander?
590,00:42:55,00:42:58,My name is Paul Millander.
591,00:42:58,00:43:02,I reside at 13891 Sand Creek Road.
592,00:43:02,00:43:06,I'm 46 years of age and I'm going to kill myself.
593,00:43:06,00:43:11,"I'd like to say ""I love you"" to my mother, Isabelle."
594,00:43:11,00:43:12,I'm so sorry.
595,00:43:12,00:43:15,I never wanted to put you through this.
596,00:43:15,00:43:17,I just can't do it anymore.
597,00:43:17,00:43:20,I've lost hope.
