0	00:01:15	00:01:18	Mom, I'm tired. Can we stop now?
1	00:01:18	00:01:20	Just one more house.
2	00:01:20	00:01:22	Then we'll go home for dinner, okay?
3	00:01:30	00:01:31	They're not home.
4	00:01:31	00:01:33	Well, knock louder.
5	00:01:33	00:01:36	The Conners bought ten candy bars from you last year. (phone ringing)
6	00:01:38	00:01:39	Sharon.
7	00:01:39	00:01:41	How are you? Yes.
8	00:01:41	00:01:42	Yeah, we got back last weekend.
9	00:01:42	00:01:43	Sorry we missed the party.
10	00:01:43	00:01:45	Was he surprised?
11	00:01:47	00:01:48	Oh!
12	00:01:48	00:01:50	Wonderful. Amazing.
13	00:01:53	00:01:54	Beautiful.
14	00:01:54	00:01:56	Really, you need to go with Burt.
15	00:02:06	00:02:07	Was that our victim?
16	00:02:07	00:02:09	Well, yes and no.
17	00:02:09	00:02:11	His name is Doug Adamson.
18	00:02:11	00:02:14	He's, uh, 30 days out of county lockup, right?
19	00:02:14	00:02:16	Got a long rap sheet.
20	00:02:16	00:02:17	Mostly drug use.
21	00:02:17	00:02:19	Looks like he fell.
22	00:02:19	00:02:20	Knocked himself out.
23	00:02:20	00:02:22	I assume we're not here 'cause he hurt his head.
24	00:02:22	00:02:24	Oh, he didn't live here.
25	00:02:24	00:02:26	This house belongs to the Conner family.
26	00:02:26	00:02:28	The neighbors said they haven't seen them for almost a month.
27	00:02:28	00:02:32	Ah. Well, whole families just don't vanish.
28	00:02:32	00:02:36	Well, we know it's easier to find a car than people, so I've got a broadcast out on their vehicles.
29	00:02:36	00:02:39	What does Doug Adamson have to say about all this?
30	00:02:39	00:02:42	Well, nothing yet, but I'm going down to the ER later.
31	00:02:42	00:02:52	All right, so we've got a convicted felon just out of jail at the same time that a family disappears and we find him inside their house-- that does not look good for Mr. Adamson.
32	00:02:52	00:02:55	Looks even worse for the Conner family.
33	00:03:31	00:03:35	So a whole family is missing and no one reports it to the police.
34	00:03:35	00:03:38	Well, if I wasn't a CSI, I would think they just moved out.
35	00:03:38	00:03:40	No TV, no furniture, no electronics.
36	00:03:40	00:03:42	Everything of value is pretty much gone.
37	00:03:42	00:03:45	Not if you include sentimental value.
38	00:03:45	00:03:48	Looks like they left behind some of their family photos.
39	00:03:48	00:03:50	Hard to believe they would leave those.
40	00:03:52	00:03:55	All right, so this is where our intruder, Doug, hit his head and fell.
41	00:03:59	00:04:01	I'll see if I can find anything else here.
42	00:04:01	00:04:03	I'm gonna take the outside.
43	00:04:03	00:04:05	Carpet hasn't been recently shampooed.
44	00:04:05	00:04:06	Yeah.
45	00:04:06	00:04:11	You know, each of these photos is a family member alone.
46	00:04:11	00:04:12	Doing their own thing.
47	00:04:12	00:04:13	Except for this one.
48	00:04:15	00:04:19	Guess that's how families are these days.
49	00:04:19	00:04:22	Huh. Well, that's strange.
50	00:04:23	00:04:25	This curtain's missing.
51	00:04:25	00:04:27	Tieback too.
52	00:04:31	00:04:34	2 millimeter medium force spatter.
53	00:04:34	00:04:35	From Doug Adamson's fall?
54	00:04:35	00:04:37	Yeah, some of it.
55	00:04:37	00:04:38	Okay, so...
56	00:04:38	00:04:39	Doug fell here...
57	00:04:42	00:04:45	...causing spatter to move upward, close to the floor.
58	00:04:45	00:04:50	Further away, over here, spatter is traveling downwards.
59	00:04:50	00:04:52	Indicates a separate event.
60	00:04:52	00:04:53	Exactly.
61	00:04:54	00:04:56	Yeah, okay.
62	00:04:56	00:04:58	Yeah, here we go.
63	00:04:58	00:05:01	There's some spatter on the fireplace, and on the wall as well.
64	00:05:03	00:05:07	Nick, look at the ceiling.
65	00:05:07	00:05:08	Castoff.
66	00:05:08	00:05:09	Ooh, yeah.
67	00:05:12	00:05:13	All right, I'm gonna luminol the place. Okay.
68	00:05:13	00:05:17	Do you mind stepping out so that we both don't trample all over the evidence?
69	00:05:17	00:05:18	Seriously?
70	00:05:18	00:05:20	Yeah.
71	00:05:24	00:05:25	She kick you out? Yeah!
72	00:05:29	00:05:30	Hey, check this out.
73	00:05:30	00:05:32	The caulk on this window...
74	00:05:32	00:05:35	it's fresh.
75	00:05:35	00:05:38	Yeah, and the other ones are yellow and cracked.
76	00:05:38	00:05:42	That means that somebody recently replaced that glass.
77	00:05:42	00:05:43	All right.
78	00:05:48	00:05:49	Hey, come take a look at this.
79	00:05:53	00:05:55	Does that look like blood to you?
80	00:05:55	00:05:57	To the naked eye, yes, it does.
81	00:05:57	00:05:59	Soaked all the way through the mat.
82	00:05:59	00:06:02	It's hard to believe someone would drag a dead body out the front door.
83	00:06:02	00:06:05	Even at night, there's not much cover out here.
84	00:06:05	00:06:08	But I bet they did some cleaning up.
85	00:06:08	00:06:11	Which means we're getting dirty.
86	00:06:11	00:06:13	Time to Dumpster dive.
87	00:06:13	00:06:15	You're joining me, right?
88	00:06:15	00:06:16	Excuse me.
89	00:06:16	00:06:18	Officer?
90	00:06:18	00:06:19	Hi, there.
91	00:06:19	00:06:20	What's your name?
92	00:06:20	00:06:22	I'm Madge.
93	00:06:22	00:06:23	I'm a neighbor.
94	00:06:23	00:06:25	I'm Nick Stokes. I'm with the Crime Lab.
95	00:06:25	00:06:28	I was just wondering... what happened to the Conners?
96	00:06:28	00:06:31	Well, it's an ongoing investigation, so I can't really talk about it too much.
97	00:06:31	00:06:33	Oh, I understand.
98	00:06:33	00:06:34	Did you know them?
99	00:06:34	00:06:42	Well, Dwight, the husband, 00 to 5 And Claire, she's a lovely stay-at-home mom.
100	00:06:42	00:06:46	Their son, I think he graduated high school last year.
101	00:06:46	00:06:49	I don't know much about the daughter...
102	00:06:49	00:06:51	but I haven't seen any of them in the last few weeks.
103	00:06:51	00:06:55	And in that time span, did you see anybody hanging around the house?
104	00:06:55	00:06:58	Just the man they took away in the ambulance.
105	00:06:58	00:07:01	You know, he was working around the house and living there.
106	00:07:01	00:07:03	I thought he was a relative.
107	00:07:03	00:07:04	Hmm.
108	00:07:04	00:07:06	Did you notice anything else?
109	00:07:06	00:07:11	Uh, yeah, there was a great big truck, and they were loading in all kinds of furniture.
110	00:07:11	00:07:14	I thought the Conners were remodeling or something.
111	00:07:14	00:07:20	I'd be willing to bet that you saw something on that truck to give it away, like a company name, logo, anything like that?
112	00:07:20	00:07:21	Yes, I did.
113	00:07:21	00:07:25	It was, uh, Las Vegas Consignment.
114	00:07:25	00:07:26	That's a big help.
115	00:07:26	00:07:29	I would love to live next-door to you.
116	00:07:29	00:07:31	Oh, aren't you sweet?
117	00:07:34	00:07:37	Hey, hey, that's all the clothes I got! Sorry.
118	00:07:37	00:07:38	Gotta take them in for evidence.
119	00:07:38	00:07:39	It's okay, Doug.
120	00:07:39	00:07:40	Question and answer time. Do we have to?
121	00:07:40	00:07:41	My head still hurts.
122	00:07:41	00:07:43	You're fine.
123	00:07:43	00:07:45	How'd you know the Conner family?
124	00:07:45	00:07:46	I was behind the mini-mart. You know the one on 12th?
125	00:07:46	00:07:48	What day was this?
126	00:07:48	00:07:50	February 18.
127	00:07:50	00:07:52	Oh, and that's the day you were released from County.
128	00:07:52	00:07:56	Yeah, same day. Mm-hmm.
129	00:07:56	00:07:59	Dude drives up and asks me if I wanted to earn some money.
130	00:07:59	00:08:00	Had you seen him before?
131	00:08:00	00:08:01	No. Never.
132	00:08:01	00:08:02	What kind of work did he ask you to do?
133	00:08:02	00:08:04	Just some odd jobs around his house.
134	00:08:04	00:08:07	Mm-hmm. Is this the guy you spoke with?
135	00:08:07	00:08:08	Not him.
136	00:08:08	00:08:11	Him... and-and she was with him.
137	00:08:11	00:08:12	Ethan Conner and his mother Claire.
138	00:08:12	00:08:17	Yeah. I went with them, I cleaned their garage. I didn't finish till late, so they let me spend the night.
139	00:08:17	00:08:19	Inside the house? Yeah.
140	00:08:19	00:08:21	The guest room.
141	00:08:21	00:08:23	Sounds like nice people.
142	00:08:23	00:08:24	Can I see your hands, please?
143	00:08:26	00:08:27	Over.
144	00:08:29	00:08:31	They're pretty thrashed.
145	00:08:31	00:08:32	Hard work'll do that.
146	00:08:32	00:08:35	Okay, so you spent the night. Then what happened?
147	00:08:35	00:08:37	Then, the next morning, they asked me to dig some trenches for the sprinklers.
148	00:08:37	00:08:39	Some trenches?
149	00:08:39	00:08:40	Yeah.
150	00:08:40	00:08:43	What happened to the Conners, Doug?
151	00:08:43	00:08:44	No one's seen them lately.
152	00:08:44	00:08:46	In fact, you're the last person to see them at all.
153	00:08:46	00:08:48	I don't know.
154	00:08:48	00:08:50	Okay?
155	00:08:50	00:08:53	I was digging in the backyard, saw them get into their car.
156	00:08:53	00:08:54	What kind of car?
157	00:08:54	00:08:57	A blue SUV. Mm-hmm.
158	00:08:57	00:09:00	They said they were going to a movie, and they never came back.
159	00:09:00	00:09:02	A movie. Yeah.
160	00:09:02	00:09:05	So you just kept digging, even though you weren't getting paid. Yeah.
161	00:09:05	00:09:06	They told me I could stay as long as I wanted.
162	00:09:06	00:09:10	For 30 days? Didn't you ever get curious as to where they were?
163	00:09:10	00:09:11	Yeah, but what was I supposed to do?
164	00:09:11	00:09:14	Call the cops?
165	00:09:14	00:09:15	They'd take me back to jail.
166	00:09:15	00:09:16	So whatever happened to their furniture?
167	00:09:16	00:09:19	The computers, TVs...
168	00:09:22	00:09:24	Look, I-I waited for them to come back.
169	00:09:24	00:09:26	Really.
170	00:09:26	00:09:32	Then after a week or two, I ran out of food, so I sold some of the stuff, just enough to cover what they owed me.
171	00:09:34	00:09:37	Then-then I sold some more stuff.
172	00:09:37	00:09:43	So perfect strangers invite you, a convicted felon and drug user, to stay at their house indefinitely.
173	00:09:43	00:09:48	And then they mysteriously vanish, leaving you to sell off their property piece by piece, for cash.
174	00:09:48	00:09:50	Sounds hard to believe, right?
175	00:09:50	00:09:51	It's ridiculous.
176	00:09:51	00:09:55	When he gets discharged, bring him to the police station.
177	00:09:55	00:09:57	And beg somebody to clean him up.
178	00:10:32	00:10:34	Wow!
179	00:10:34	00:10:36	That is a lot of blood!
180	00:10:36	00:10:38	What did you find outside? More blood.
181	00:10:38	00:10:41	And five bags of wet, stinky trash.
182	00:10:41	00:10:42	Okay.
183	00:10:42	00:10:46	So the predominance of blood is in this main living area.
184	00:10:46	00:10:50	I marked the voids with chalk to determine the furniture placement.
185	00:10:50	00:10:55	Which was not very difficult because this entire carpet is covered in blood.
186	00:10:55	00:10:57	So I found two interesting areas.
187	00:10:57	00:11:02	Right here's the most concentrated stain, About 2 feet in diameter.
188	00:11:02	00:11:04	So somebody was laying there bleeding.
189	00:11:04	00:11:09	And the medium-force spatter that I found on the wall tells me that the beating occurred in this general area.
190	00:11:09	00:11:14	And the cast-off positions the suspect here.
191	00:11:14	00:11:17	But without the furniture, I really can't be more specific.
192	00:11:17	00:11:19	Well, I think I can help you out there.
193	00:11:19	00:11:24	The neighbor lady said she saw Las Vegas Consignment moving a bunch of furniture out of here.
194	00:11:24	00:11:26	Whatever you could recover would really help us.
195	00:11:26	00:11:29	I'll get on that right now. I'll see you later. Bye.
196	00:11:29	00:11:32	The most concerning evidence I found is over here.
197	00:11:36	00:11:37	Well...
198	00:11:37	00:11:39	drag marks.
199	00:11:39	00:11:40	Mm-hmm.
200	00:11:42	00:11:44	Where's that lead to?
201	00:11:44	00:11:45	The end of the hall?
202	00:11:45	00:11:47	A garage and backyard.
203	00:11:47	00:11:52	Bloody drag marks mean dead bodies to me.
204	00:11:52	00:11:55	And anyone left alive who got in the car with a killer...
205	00:11:55	00:11:56	Probably dead too.
206	00:12:00	00:12:03	Okay, the couch goes right over here.
207	00:12:03	00:12:06	Be really careful that you don't step on the chalk, okay?
208	00:12:06	00:12:07	And the string.
209	00:12:07	00:12:09	Really careful of the string. Thank you.
210	00:12:09	00:12:11	She's a very bossy lady.
211	00:12:11	00:12:12	Morning! Morning.
212	00:12:12	00:12:15	Wow, we're so lucky that we could track all this down, huh?
213	00:12:15	00:12:16	Nick's still working on it.
214	00:12:16	00:12:20	Evidently, Las Vegas Consignment keeps some pretty shoddy records.
215	00:12:20	00:12:23	And some of the folks didn't want to give up their stuff.
216	00:12:23	00:12:25	How did he charm them into it?
217	00:12:25	00:12:27	Showed them the blood spatter.
218	00:12:27	00:12:31	Nice. Okay, the end table goes right here.
219	00:12:31	00:12:34	The barstool in the chalked circle.
220	00:13:12	00:13:13	Ha!
221	00:13:13	00:13:20	The, uh, cast-off pattern extends all the way across the room, which means that the weapon was long.
222	00:13:21	00:13:25	You know, earlier, I noticed that the poker from the fire set is missing.
223	00:13:25	00:13:27	That could be it.
224	00:13:27	00:13:34	All right, so based on the spatter on each of these barstools, I was able to determine where they were at the time of the beating.
225	00:13:34	00:13:36	And this one is the hero.
226	00:13:36	00:13:38	All right, well, that makes sense, right?
227	00:13:38	00:13:40	You take out the biggest threat first.
228	00:13:40	00:13:43	Okay...
229	00:13:43	00:13:44	so I'm dad.
230	00:13:44	00:13:46	All right.
231	00:13:46	00:13:49	So I am the suspect, standing right about here.
232	00:13:49	00:13:54	Point of origin is at the convergence of string, right where your head is.
233	00:13:56	00:13:58	Wait a minute. You know what?
234	00:13:58	00:14:01	You said that the victim was struck multiple times, right?
235	00:14:01	00:14:03	Yeah.
236	00:14:03	00:14:04	Why am I just sitting here taking it?
237	00:14:07	00:14:11	Nick said that he noticed that one of the curtain tiebacks was missing.
238	00:14:11	00:14:14	Yeah, maybe the victim was restrained. Yeah.
239	00:14:14	00:14:16	Tie me up. All right.
240	00:14:18	00:14:20	Ow. Sorry.
241	00:14:20	00:14:24	All right, so you're tied up and I'm hitting you.
242	00:14:32	00:14:37	You know what? That would explain the gravitational drips down the side of the stool here.
243	00:14:37	00:14:44	All right, so this is the main blood event, but without the DNA results, I can't tell you how many other members of the family were injured.
244	00:14:44	00:14:46	This is a lot of blood.
245	00:14:46	00:14:48	Yeah, I know. Hey.
246	00:14:48	00:14:51	you guys have got to see this.
247	00:14:53	00:14:55	The ground-penetrating radar found something.
248	00:14:57	00:14:59	It's the family dog.
249	00:14:59	00:15:01	It looks like it's been here over a month.
250	00:15:01	00:15:02	Well, it was carefully wrapped.
251	00:15:02	00:15:04	Conners must have buried it.
252	00:15:04	00:15:06	It gets worse, guys.
253	00:15:11	00:15:12	The throat's been cut.
254	00:15:12	00:15:15	That's horrible. Nobody would do that to their own dog.
255	00:15:15	00:15:19	No, that was a threat; a warning to one of the Conners.
256	00:15:19	00:15:23	Whoever that was knows who sent it and what it meant.
257	00:15:23	00:15:26	Someone in the Conner family was in way over their head.
258	00:15:26	00:15:28	Probably what got them all killed.
259	00:15:34	00:15:37	You submitted over 50 samples to DNA from the Conner scene.
260	00:15:37	00:15:40	We have a family of four who are missing.
261	00:15:40	00:15:43	I would rather collect too much than too little.
262	00:15:43	00:15:47	Right. Okay, so how are we doing with the family DNA reference samples?
263	00:15:47	00:15:51	All the obvious sources of DNA in the house-- like hairbrushes and toothbrushes-- all that was thrown out.
264	00:15:51	00:15:53	Mm. What about the trash?
265	00:15:53	00:15:57	Morgan and Hodges are going through it, but anything they find is likely contaminated.
266	00:15:57	00:16:03	Until I get verifiable references, all I can tell you is which donor bled where and their sex.
267	00:16:03	00:16:04	I will take whatever you've got.
268	00:16:07	00:16:10	JF-1 and 2 match Doug Adamson.
269	00:16:10	00:16:13	Just as we thought.
270	00:16:13	00:16:18	I was able to identify another male bleeder in the house, but he only matched one sample, JF-13.
271	00:16:18	00:16:25	Okay, so that's either the father, Dwight Conner, or the son, Ethan.
272	00:16:25	00:16:28	Uh, given the limited population of the four Conner family members.
273	00:16:28	00:16:29	I'll take that as a yes.
274	00:16:29	00:16:37	Uh, all the other blood sources in the house originated from a single female donor.
275	00:16:37	00:16:39	Female?
276	00:16:39	00:16:41	So the blood spatter and the drag marks?
277	00:16:41	00:16:42	That's right.
278	00:16:44	00:16:51	Okay, so that's gotta either be the mother, Claire Conner or the daughter, Heather.
279	00:16:53	00:16:55	Assuming the limited population...
280	00:16:55	00:16:57	...of the Conner family. Yes, I get it.
281	00:16:57	00:16:59	Thank you. Thank you, Henry.
282	00:16:59	00:17:00	Okay.
283	00:17:02	00:17:04	I don't get it.
284	00:17:04	00:17:09	I mean, on the surface, the Conners seem like this typical family, right?
285	00:17:09	00:17:12	The mom is a housewife, daughter Heather's homeschooled.
286	00:17:12	00:17:15	Which is why the school didn't report her missing.
287	00:17:15	00:17:17	Is the homeschooling a recent thing?
288	00:17:17	00:17:18	No. No, no.
289	00:17:18	00:17:21	There was a bullying incident about four years ago.
290	00:17:21	00:17:22	Mom pulled her out of school.
291	00:17:22	00:17:24	Has been teaching ever since. Okay.
292	00:17:24	00:17:27	What about you? Did you find anything in her room?
293	00:17:27	00:17:29	Well, pretty routine stuff.
294	00:17:29	00:17:32	Nothing that raised any red flags.
295	00:17:32	00:17:36	Okay, all right, that leaves Ethan the son, he's out of high school.
296	00:17:36	00:17:41	Some of the neighbors say that he hangs around some shady characters.
297	00:17:41	00:17:44	But when you look at his record, two speeding tickets.
298	00:17:44	00:17:46	The search of his room is a different story.
299	00:17:46	00:17:51	Found some stash boxes with traces of methamphetamine and THC.
300	00:17:51	00:17:54	Now, I think they're Doug's, the homeless guy's.
301	00:17:54	00:18:02	But if they're not... you know, then maybe Ethan, maybe Ethan got into some trouble with his sketchy friends.
302	00:18:02	00:18:05	Enough trouble to kill the whole family?
303	00:18:05	00:18:06	No. (phone chirps)
304	00:18:06	00:18:07	Sorry. Brass.
305	00:18:12	00:18:13	Oh, yeah. Hey.
306	00:18:13	00:18:15	Got your, uh, text.
307	00:18:15	00:18:17	You have something for me on Claire Conner?
308	00:18:17	00:18:19	On February 1, Claire Conner filed a police report.
309	00:18:19	00:18:21	Uh, she claimed someone was stalking her.
310	00:18:21	00:18:23	Mostly minor vandalism.
311	00:18:23	00:18:27	You know, they keyed her car, slashed her tires, threw a rock through her window.
312	00:18:27	00:18:29	That would explain the glass being recently replaced.
313	00:18:29	00:18:33	Yeah, well, on the same day that she called it in, she left the house for an hour.
314	00:18:33	00:18:35	She came home, all the cabinets were left wide open.
315	00:18:35	00:18:37	So somebody got in.
316	00:18:37	00:18:42	Police officers were dispatched. They offered to send a CSI tech to print the place, but she declined.
317	00:18:42	00:18:47	That's interesting because Henry just confirmed that the blood on their front porch was canine.
318	00:18:47	00:18:51	Their dog was killed and displayed as a threat.
319	00:18:51	00:18:53	She never reported that.
320	00:18:53	00:18:54	That's a little odd.
321	00:18:54	00:18:58	(phone rings) Oh. Excuse me.
322	00:18:58	00:18:59	Brass.
323	00:19:01	00:19:04	Okay. Good work.
324	00:19:04	00:19:09	So Dwight Conner worked for Marvin Braxton of Braxton Imports.
325	00:19:09	00:19:10	Coffee bean guy?
326	00:19:10	00:19:12	Well, coffee and other Colombian imports.
327	00:19:12	00:19:17	Braxton fired Conner one day before the family went missing.
328	00:19:17	00:19:19	I'm bringing him in now.
329	00:19:19	00:19:21	Dwight Conner worked for me for seven years.
330	00:19:21	00:19:23	In what capacity?
331	00:19:23	00:19:24	He was my CFO.
332	00:19:24	00:19:26	Oh. Why'd you fire him?
333	00:19:26	00:19:29	He stole from me--500 Gs.
334	00:19:29	00:19:34	That's a lot of money. Found out during a routine audit. Took the money from the company account, put it into his personal account.
335	00:19:34	00:19:36	Didn't even try to hide it.
336	00:19:36	00:19:38	That's not very smart for a financial guy.
337	00:19:38	00:19:40	He denies it, you know? But you can check for yourself.
338	00:19:40	00:19:42	It's in the account.
339	00:19:42	00:19:45	Did you know that the Conner family are officially missing persons?
340	00:19:45	00:19:46	I've heard something about it.
341	00:19:46	00:19:51	And are you aware that they went missing one day after you fired Dwight Conner?
342	00:19:51	00:19:54	I am not aware of any dates.
343	00:19:54	00:19:56	I just figured they ran off with the money.
344	00:19:56	00:19:58	Funny thing is it's still in his account.
345	00:19:58	00:20:00	My new guy checked.
346	00:20:00	00:20:05	You know, we both know that Braxton Imports launders more money than it earns.
347	00:20:05	00:20:07	Those charges were dropped.
348	00:20:07	00:20:10	This is a big money hit for any business to absorb.
349	00:20:10	00:20:12	I'll get the money back.
350	00:20:12	00:20:16	I got my own way of doing it, and they don't involve going after a family.
351	00:20:16	00:20:19	We think the Conner family met with foul play.
352	00:20:19	00:20:21	You're talking murder now.
353	00:20:27	00:20:30	Uh-huh. I have no idea about that.
354	00:20:30	00:20:33	You can direct any other questions to my lawyer.
355	00:20:37	00:20:39	So this is the son's car, huh?
356	00:20:39	00:20:42	Yeah. Auto shop called after the broadcast.
357	00:20:42	00:20:43	Driver's side is pretty banged up.
358	00:20:43	00:20:45	Car's been in the shop for a month.
359	00:20:45	00:20:46	Obviously hasn't been repaired yet.
360	00:20:46	00:20:49	A month? You know, we keep running into this four-week wall.
361	00:20:49	00:20:53	It's like life just stopped for that entire family in an instant.
362	00:20:53	00:20:56	Yeah. The mechanic called the Conners with the estimate.
363	00:20:56	00:20:58	Never heard back, so he put the car on hold.
364	00:20:58	00:21:00	Hasn't touched it. They know what happened?
365	00:21:00	00:21:05	According to the DMV, Ethan Conner was involved in an accident February 15.
366	00:21:05	00:21:07	Claimed it was due to brake failure.
367	00:21:07	00:21:08	Take a look.
368	00:21:11	00:21:18	The steel brake lines on this car have been completely cut intentionally, front and back.
369	00:21:18	00:21:21	Maybe it put him in the hospital.
370	00:21:21	00:21:24	I found a medical bracelet belonging to Ethan in the car.
371	00:21:24	00:21:27	It's from Desert Palm Hospital.
372	00:21:27	00:21:32	Well, Brass is convinced that the entire family is paying for the father stealing dirty money.
373	00:21:32	00:21:37	You know, maybe they were trying to threaten the father by hurting the son, you know what I mean?
374	00:21:37	00:21:39	All Mob style.
375	00:21:44	00:21:48	Ugh, you know, we're not gonna be able to pull any definitive DNA references from all of this trash.
376	00:21:48	00:21:50	It's a waste of time.
377	00:21:50	00:21:51	I disagree.
378	00:21:51	00:21:52	I find garbage fascinating.
379	00:21:52	00:21:54	Yeah, that doesn't surprise me.
380	00:21:54	00:21:58	What most people throw away in trash bags is actually biodegradable or recyclable.
381	00:21:58	00:22:02	Unnecessarily taking up the precious space in our rapidly diminishing landfills.
382	00:22:02	00:22:05	Hey, don't look at me. I recycle.
383	00:22:05	00:22:11	I've started recording my garbage in a trash journal.
384	00:22:11	00:22:15	So now I discard no more than 3 pounds per week.
385	00:22:15	00:22:17	You have a trash journal?
386	00:22:17	00:22:18	Yeah.
387	00:22:19	00:22:22	This looks like a contract for a storage unit.
388	00:22:24	00:22:27	Maybrook Storage.
389	00:22:27	00:22:30	Rented to Doug Adamson?
390	00:22:30	00:22:31	February 19, 2014.
391	00:22:31	00:22:35	It's the morning after he had a sleepover at the Conner house.
392	00:22:35	00:22:37	Unit 353.
393	00:22:37	00:22:40	Why would Doug Adamson need a storage unit?
394	00:22:42	00:22:44	353.
395	00:22:49	00:22:51	Ugh...
396	00:22:51	00:22:53	Hard to mistake that smell.
397	00:23:06	00:23:08	There's a lot of blood.
398	00:23:21	00:23:23	Inside is empty.
399	00:23:25	00:23:27	Keys are still in the ignition.
400	00:23:32	00:23:33	Finn.
401	00:23:39	00:23:40	Dwight Conner.
402	00:23:42	00:23:45	Where's the rest of the Conner family?
403	00:23:56	00:23:59	I.D. confirms that this is the dad-- Dwight Conner.
404	00:23:59	00:24:02	Large volume of blood tells us that he was killed here.
405	00:24:02	00:24:07	Based on the castoff, he was struck multiple times.
406	00:24:09	00:24:10	No kidding.
407	00:24:10	00:24:13	Mr. Conner's skull is in, like, a million pieces.
408	00:24:15	00:24:18	There are bone fragments embedded in the wood.
409	00:24:18	00:24:20	Doug must've been really angry.
410	00:24:46	00:24:48	Confirmed blood in the trunk.
411	00:24:48	00:24:51	Did you find any blood in the rest of the car?
412	00:24:51	00:24:52	Not a drop. Hmm.
413	00:24:54	00:24:56	DNA match.
414	00:24:56	00:24:58	Blood in the house, female donor.
415	00:25:01	00:25:12	Okay, so either Claire or Heather Conner is killed at the house, then put into the trunk of the car, the body dumped somewhere.
416	00:25:12	00:25:16	Then Mr. Conner was driven here to this storage unit, where he was killed.
417	00:25:16	00:25:20	That means that Dwight Conner was with the killer when he got rid of the body in the trunk.
418	00:25:20	00:25:23	Dead weight is heavy.
419	00:25:23	00:25:26	Maybe the killer needed Conner's help.
420	00:25:29	00:25:33	Looks like there's tar on the passenger side of the car.
421	00:25:33	00:25:37	They must've picked it up around the time Mr. Conner was killed.
422	00:25:40	00:25:42	Means the car was driven over a freshly paved road.
423	00:25:44	00:25:47	Find the road, maybe we'll find the rest of the Conner family.
424	00:25:47	00:25:48	How many times do I have to tell you?
425	00:25:48	00:25:50	I never rented any storage locker.
426	00:25:50	00:25:56	How else do you explain these photos, Doug? They were taken 35 a.m.
427	00:25:56	00:25:58	The same day the Conner family went missing.
428	00:25:58	00:26:01	I was digging trenches in the Conner's yard that whole morning.
429	00:26:01	00:26:02	That is not me.
430	00:26:02	00:26:06	The shirt you're wearing in the photo is the same one I collected from you at the hospital.
431	00:26:06	00:26:09	I can't be the only guy in the world who likes plaid, man.
432	00:26:09	00:26:14	Dwight Conner was found dead in a storage locker that you rented.
433	00:26:14	00:26:17	With his head bashed in by a baseball bat.
434	00:26:17	00:26:20	Conner's wife, Claire, and their two children are missing.
435	00:26:20	00:26:26	Blood is spattered all over their house, the same house you were squatting in.
436	00:26:26	00:26:29	Look, I told you, they invited me to live with them.
437	00:26:29	00:26:33	Okay, Doug, so you're telling me that you never saw any of the Conner family before?
438	00:26:33	00:26:35	That's what I keep telling you.
439	00:26:35	00:26:37	You're lying, Doug.
440	00:26:37	00:26:42	You and Ethan Conner were on a 72-hour psych hold in the same facility on the same day.
441	00:26:42	00:26:43	January 13.
442	00:26:43	00:26:45	He was there for an O.D. You were for medical detox.
443	00:26:45	00:26:48	So? So, there's only ten people in the unit!
444	00:26:48	00:26:49	You're telling me you never even saw the guy?
445	00:26:49	00:26:55	Nope. So it's just a coincidence that Ethan offered you a job at their house and his whole family may be dead?
446	00:26:55	00:26:59	Look, I'm not saying I'm a saint.
447	00:26:59	00:27:01	Okay? I've been an addict since I was 13.
448	00:27:01	00:27:04	Alcohol, coke, meth, you name it.
449	00:27:04	00:27:06	But I have never hurt anybody.
450	00:27:06	00:27:10	Admit it--you'll do anything to feed your habit.
451	00:27:10	00:27:11	Even kill.
452	00:27:17	00:27:20	If we charge you for this crime, you're looking at murder.
453	00:27:20	00:27:22	You know what that means?
454	00:27:22	00:27:25	So do yourself a favor.
455	00:27:25	00:27:30	Tell us where the rest of the Conner family is, and maybe we can cut a deal.
456	00:27:30	00:27:32	I'm done talking.
457	00:27:33	00:27:34	I want a lawyer.
458	00:27:41	00:27:45	Okay, so I've got some DNA results here for you.
459	00:27:45	00:27:49	The unknown male DNA we found in the house is a match to Mr. Conner here.
460	00:27:49	00:27:54	So he was injured there, and then killed in the-- in the storage unit.
461	00:27:54	00:27:58	And then Henry compared Mr. Conner's DNA against the unknown female blood.
462	00:27:58	00:28:00	There were no markers in common.
463	00:28:00	00:28:03	She they're definitely not related in any way.
464	00:28:03	00:28:07	So it wasn't the daughter that was killed in the house.
465	00:28:07	00:28:09	It was the wife, which is interesting.
466	00:28:09	00:28:13	Conner here was fired by his boss Braxton for embezzling, right?
467	00:28:13	00:28:29	Brass confirmed that it was a lump sum electronic deposit of a half-million dollars. So what if-- what if Braxton or one of his goons forced Dwight here to watch his loved ones being murdered before he himself was beaten to death?
468	00:28:29	00:28:32	Except we still haven't found a link between Braxton and Doug.
469	00:28:32	00:28:34	We do know that Doug knew Ethan.
470	00:28:34	00:28:36	They were both addicts.
471	00:28:36	00:28:39	Maybe this was some kind of drug deal gone wrong.
472	00:28:39	00:28:42	And the family is just collateral damage.
473	00:28:42	00:28:46	Boy, beautiful wife, two kids, a dog.
474	00:28:46	00:28:51	I mean, I bet they seemed like the perfect American family.
475	00:28:51	00:28:52	Nothing's ever what it seems, is it?
476	00:28:52	00:28:54	No, it's not.
477	00:28:58	00:29:02	So did you, uh-- did you already make a note on the trace on these pants?
478	00:29:02	00:29:06	The reddish dust? I figured it was soil or crushed brick.
479	00:29:08	00:29:10	It's embedded in the tread of his shoe as well.
480	00:29:10	00:29:17	You know, if the killer used Dwight to help dispose of the other bodies, he could've picked that stuff up from where they were buried.
481	00:29:19	00:29:22	Are you familiar with the Mesozoic Era?
482	00:29:22	00:29:24	The Age of Reptiles?
483	00:29:24	00:29:26	Ah, I see someone paid attention during earth science class.
484	00:29:26	00:29:35	The Mesozoic Era was 250 million years ago, during a time in which Nevada's landscape was developing formations of salt and gypsum.
485	00:29:35	00:29:43	As the years passed, oxidization gave these formations a beautiful crimson hue, creating what we now know as Red Rock Canyon.
486	00:29:43	00:29:46	The red powder that Nick found on Mr. Conner's pants and shoes.
487	00:29:46	00:29:47	Secluded.
488	00:29:47	00:29:50	A perfect place for a killer to bury the rest of the family.
489	00:29:50	00:29:54	Still, that's over 100,000 acres.
490	00:29:54	00:29:56	Actually, over 200,000.
491	00:29:56	00:29:57	Right.
492	00:29:57	00:30:02	You know, I did find some tar on the passenger side of the SUV.
493	00:30:02	00:30:05	Means the killer drove over a freshly paved road.
494	00:30:05	00:30:08	So, we're looking for an area of Red Rock near a road that was paved about a month ago.
495	00:30:08	00:30:10	Yeah.
496	00:30:10	00:30:11	Good.
497	00:30:11	00:30:13	Hey, it's Brody.
498	00:30:13	00:30:14	Thanks.
499	00:30:14	00:30:16	Can you get me the Department of Transportation?
500	00:30:56	00:30:58	I think I got something.
501	00:31:00	00:31:03	Could be a body.
502	00:31:03	00:31:05	Yeah, okay, let's start digging.
503	00:31:05	00:31:07	Okay, everybody, let's bring it in!
504	00:31:07	00:31:08	Looks like we got a body.
505	00:31:25	00:31:27	Found some kind of fabric.
506	00:31:31	00:31:34	That's the missing curtain from the Conner house.
507	00:31:36	00:31:38	Okay.
508	00:31:46	00:31:48	Definitely female.
509	00:31:50	00:31:51	Badly mummified.
510	00:31:53	00:31:56	You think it's Mrs. Conner?
511	00:31:56	00:31:57	Yeah, either that or her daughter.
512	00:32:07	00:32:08	Hey. Hey, Finn.
513	00:32:08	00:32:12	So Nick and Morgan are still out there, but they haven't found any other bodies.
514	00:32:12	00:32:14	I'm just finishing up with our victim here.
515	00:32:14	00:32:18	Ligature marks on her wrist confirms she was restrained.
516	00:32:18	00:32:20	Multiple contusions to the head as well.
517	00:32:20	00:32:21	Was that the cause of death?
518	00:32:21	00:32:26	Subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by blunt-force trauma.
519	00:32:26	00:32:29	The weapon cracked the skull, but it didn't perforate it.
520	00:32:29	00:32:31	Suggests that the killer didn't have much upper-body strength.
521	00:32:31	00:32:35	Were you able to narrow down what the weapon was? Something heavy.
522	00:32:35	00:32:36	An inch or less in diameter.
523	00:32:36	00:32:38	Could it have been a fireplace poker?
524	00:32:38	00:32:40	That's consistent with her injuries.
525	00:32:40	00:32:42	There was one missing from the house.
526	00:32:43	00:32:45	The victim's X-rays.
527	00:32:48	00:32:50	Is that an IUD?
528	00:32:50	00:32:54	I did remove an intrauterine device during autopsy.
529	00:32:54	00:32:59	According to their medical records, Claire Conner had a hysterectomy five years ago.
530	00:32:59	00:33:02	That means this is not Claire Conner.
531	00:33:04	00:33:07	And Heather was never prescribed birth control.
532	00:33:07	00:33:09	So it's not the daughter either.
533	00:33:11	00:33:13	Who is this woman?
534	00:33:18	00:33:19	Hey. Hmm?
535	00:33:19	00:33:21	You know the great thing about IUDs?
536	00:33:21	00:33:22	Besides the obvious?
537	00:33:22	00:33:25	They have serial numbers.
538	00:33:25	00:33:30	Meet Jessica Fenton, our mystery woman buried in Red Rock.
539	00:33:30	00:33:33	Her DNA matched the female blood in the house.
540	00:33:33	00:33:35	Well, that's interesting.
541	00:33:35	00:33:44	So Ms. Fenton here was killed at the Conner house, then put in the back of their SUV, driven out to Red Rock, and buried. Do we know why?
542	00:33:44	00:33:46	I mean, what's the connection to the family?
543	00:33:46	00:33:47	Well, I'm working on that.
544	00:33:47	00:33:50	She was an IT specialist, worked from home.
545	00:33:50	00:33:53	Landlord reported her missing when she didn't pay her rent.
546	00:33:53	00:33:57	Nick just recovered her laptop, so he's going through it right now.
547	00:34:03	00:34:05	Is that Dwight Conner in a sex tape?
548	00:34:05	00:34:07	Oh, yeah, but not with his wife.
549	00:34:07	00:34:09	This was taken three months ago.
550	00:34:09	00:34:14	Looks like he and our victim from the Red Rock were, uh, having a little fun on the side.
551	00:34:14	00:34:16	She's totally playing it to the camera.
552	00:34:16	00:34:20	Oh, yeah, but I don't even think he knows it's there.
553	00:34:20	00:34:22	And check this out.
554	00:34:22	00:34:25	Jessica Fenton's hard drive was filled with hundreds of these photos.
555	00:34:25	00:34:29	All of Conner and his wife and kids.
556	00:34:29	00:34:33	Claire Conner was right-- someone was stalking their family.
557	00:34:33	00:34:34	Yeah, but it all happened pretty fast.
558	00:34:34	00:34:37	I mean, the affair happened in December.
559	00:34:37	00:34:47	And then a few weeks later, she goes all Fatal Attraction on him, breaks into his house, and then kills the family pet after treating it like that.
560	00:34:47	00:34:51	And that's cold-blooded. Well, she also tried to kill their son.
561	00:34:51	00:34:53	I found diagonal cutters at her house.
562	00:34:53	00:34:57	Liquid on the hinge smells and looks like brake fluid.
563	00:34:57	00:35:02	Okay, all this time, we have been thinking that this entire family is dead.
564	00:35:02	00:35:03	Maybe we're wrong.
565	00:35:03	00:35:10	The cheating husband, the mistress--both dead-- but who's the most obvious suspect right now?
566	00:35:10	00:35:14	Claire Conner. I mean, if she found out about the affair, she could've killed them both.
567	00:35:14	00:35:15	Yeah, and then what?
568	00:35:15	00:35:17	Just grabs her kids and...
569	00:35:17	00:35:18	gets the hell out of Dodge?
570	00:35:21	00:35:26	I gotta say, Dwight Conner picked the wrong woman to mess with with Jessica Fenton.
571	00:35:26	00:35:32	She used her computer skills to hack into the company server and then transferred half a million bucks into his private bank account.
572	00:35:32	00:35:34	She got him fired.
573	00:35:34	00:35:40	Yeah. Yeah, and as if that wasn't enough, Nick found evidence that she contacted the wife and gave her the sex tape.
574	00:35:40	00:35:42	Proving that Claire Conner knew about the affair.
575	00:35:42	00:35:45	Yeah, and she also knew who was threatening her family.
576	00:35:45	00:35:51	Nick also found an email from Claire to Ms. Fenton on February 18 saying, We need to talk.
577	00:35:51	00:35:54	That was one day before the family went missing.
578	00:35:54	00:35:57	Which explains why Jessica Fenton was at the Conner house in the first place.
579	00:35:57	00:35:59	Okay, so...
580	00:35:59	00:36:02	Claire Conner confronts her husband's mistress.
581	00:36:02	00:36:03	Mm-hmm. Things escalate.
582	00:36:03	00:36:05	Claire hits her.
583	00:36:05	00:36:06	Jessica falls down.
584	00:36:09	00:36:11	Do you like the tape I made with your husband?
585	00:36:11	00:36:13	Obviously, the rest of the conversation did not go very well.
586	00:36:13	00:36:15	Get off me!
587	00:36:20	00:36:26	And we also know that Dwight Conner's blood was found at the scene, so at some point, he came in there to try to intervene.
588	00:36:26	00:36:27	What the hell are you doing? Stop!
589	00:36:27	00:36:29	Give me it.
590	00:36:29	00:36:31	No! (groans)
591	00:36:31	00:36:37	So now Claire and Dwight Conner have a body in their living room.
592	00:36:37	00:36:41	they can call the cops or cover it up.
593	00:36:41	00:36:43	They chose the latter.
594	00:36:43	00:36:48	They wrapped her in a curtain, put her in the back of a car, and buried her out at Red Rock.
595	00:36:48	00:36:52	And they drove to the storage place, where Claire Conner killed her husband.
596	00:36:52	00:36:54	Okay, that all makes sense, right?
597	00:36:57	00:36:59	Except for the storage locker.
598	00:36:59	00:37:02	I mean, we know that Doug Adamson rented it.
599	00:37:02	00:37:04	We got him on surveillance.
600	00:37:04	00:37:06	So how's he fit into all of this?
601	00:37:06	00:37:08	Someone set him up.
602	00:37:08	00:37:12	It's a strong possibility that the person on that tape was not Doug but someone that looked like him.
603	00:37:12	00:37:14	There's no physical evidence that he was there.
604	00:37:14	00:37:15	Okay.
605	00:37:15	00:37:16	Any evidence of the wife?
606	00:37:16	00:37:18	No. No DNA from her either.
607	00:37:18	00:37:20	Well, so then what are you so excited about, Henry?
608	00:37:20	00:37:22	Dwight Conner fought his attacker.
609	00:37:22	00:37:23	I found tissue under his nails.
610	00:37:23	00:37:25	And you have the DNA results?
611	00:37:25	00:37:28	Y-STRs match Mr. Conner.
612	00:37:28	00:37:30	A male relative?
613	00:37:30	00:37:34	So Dwight Conner was killed by his son in the storage unit.
614	00:37:34	00:37:35	And I think I know why.
615	00:37:35	00:37:39	I found evidence of sexual activity on Jessica Fenton's underwear.
616	00:37:39	00:37:42	It was an admixture of her DNA and that same male profile.
617	00:37:42	00:37:44	Uh, all right.
618	00:37:44	00:37:50	So the son, Ethan, was having an affair with his father's mistress.
619	00:37:50	00:37:56	You said Jessica Fenton was trying to destroy Dwight Conner's family--maybe, maybe seducing the son was part of that plan.
620	00:37:56	00:38:01	Right. Ethan finds out that she's just using him, maybe even tried to kill him.
621	00:38:01	00:38:05	He takes his rage out on his father.
622	00:38:05	00:38:09	And now he and his mother and his sister are in the wind.
623	00:38:09	00:38:10	Russell?
624	00:38:10	00:38:12	Yeah. You have a minute?
625	00:38:12	00:38:15	So I traced the mistress's credit cards.
626	00:38:15	00:38:21	Around the time she was murdered, one of them was used to buy three bus tickets to Prescott, Arizona.
627	00:38:21	00:38:23	Claire Conner and her two kids, right?
628	00:38:23	00:38:27	Right. Next day, same card was used to book a room at an extended stay hotel.
629	00:38:27	00:38:28	Hasn't been used since.
630	00:38:28	00:38:30	Are they still there?
631	00:38:30	00:38:34	Brass contacted Prescott PD, but when they got to the room, the only one there was Heather, the daughter.
632	00:38:34	00:38:36	The daughter? Yeah.
633	00:38:41	00:38:44	I haven't seen Mom or Ethan in two weeks.
634	00:38:44	00:38:46	Why didn't you call the police?
635	00:38:46	00:38:47	I didn't want to get them in trouble.
636	00:38:47	00:38:49	Well, I mean, they're already in trouble.
637	00:38:49	00:38:50	Your mother killed Jessica Fenton.
638	00:38:52	00:38:54	Your brother k-killed your...
639	00:38:54	00:38:56	My father.
640	00:38:56	00:38:59	I know.
641	00:38:59	00:39:01	Were you in the house when Jessica Fenton was murdered?
642	00:39:01	00:39:02	No.
643	00:39:02	00:39:05	No, I just came home, and I saw that...
644	00:39:05	00:39:09	she was lying there, dead.
645	00:39:09	00:39:12	And there was blood all over the floor.
646	00:39:12	00:39:14	What did you do? (screams)
647	00:39:14	00:39:17	What were you thinking, Mom?
648	00:39:17	00:39:18	You don't understand.
649	00:39:18	00:39:20	She was never gonna stop.
650	00:39:20	00:39:21	Who is she? Ask your father.
651	00:39:21	00:39:22	This is all his fault.
652	00:39:22	00:39:24	We have to call the police. No, no, no, no.
653	00:39:24	00:39:25	No one's calling the police, honey.
654	00:39:25	00:39:26	Dad, we have to!
655	00:39:26	00:39:28	Look, here's what we're gonna do.
656	00:39:28	00:39:31	We're gonna clean this up, and we're gonna disappear as a family.
657	00:39:31	00:39:32	It's okay.
658	00:39:32	00:39:35	Nobody ever asks me what I want.
659	00:39:35	00:39:38	People just make decisions in my life, and I get no say.
660	00:39:38	00:39:42	And now, because of my parents, I don't ever get to see my friends again.
661	00:39:42	00:39:44	What about your brother?
662	00:39:44	00:39:47	He was part of the plan.
663	00:39:47	00:39:50	And how did he track down that vagrant, Doug?
664	00:39:52	00:39:54	Ethan remembered him from the mini-mart.
665	00:39:55	00:39:59	He said every morning he would be there, looking through the Dumpsters for food.
666	00:39:59	00:40:00	We found him right away.
667	00:40:00	00:40:03	And your mother and brother invited him to stay at the house?
668	00:40:03	00:40:06	Dad thought it was better if...
669	00:40:06	00:40:08	people thought we were dead.
670	00:40:08	00:40:12	You find some weird homeless guy living there, and everybody would think that he killed us.
671	00:40:14	00:40:17	Boy, your dad thought he had it all figured out, huh?
672	00:40:17	00:40:22	My dad and Ethan went to drop off the car, but only Ethan came back and met us at the bus station.
673	00:40:22	00:40:24	He had blood on him.
674	00:40:24	00:40:27	When you saw the blood, did you ask him what happened?
675	00:40:27	00:40:28	No.
676	00:40:28	00:40:30	He just said we were better off without Dad.
677	00:40:32	00:40:37	Honestly, none of this would have happened if he had just kept it in his pants.
678	00:40:41	00:40:44	So your family decided to...
679	00:40:44	00:40:46	take matters into their own hands?
680	00:40:46	00:40:48	Yes.
681	00:40:48	00:40:51	My family ruined my life.
682	00:40:51	00:40:53	Then why protect them?
683	00:40:55	00:40:57	I'm not. Tell me where your mother and brother are.
684	00:40:57	00:40:59	I said I don't know.
685	00:40:59	00:41:01	Come on, Heather.
686	00:41:01	00:41:04	You don't know where your mother and brother are?
687	00:41:04	00:41:05	No!
688	00:41:12	00:41:13	I don't believe you.
689	00:41:19	00:41:21	People don't just vanish.
690	00:41:28	00:41:34	They said they were going to see a movie, and I haven't seen them since.
