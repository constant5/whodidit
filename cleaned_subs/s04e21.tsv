0	00:00:19	00:00:22	I don't wanna go!
1	00:00:22	00:00:24	Whoa! Ooh!
2	00:00:24	00:00:26	Oh, Mommy.
3	00:00:27	00:00:29	We're all going to die.
4	00:00:30	00:00:32	Joey, put your seat belt on. NOW.
5	00:00:36	00:00:37	Hold on tight, here we go!
6	00:01:02	00:01:04	Okay, guys, come on.
7	00:01:04	00:01:06	That was so fun.
8	00:01:06	00:01:10	All right, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Pharaoh's Fever.
9	00:01:10	00:01:12	Buckle up. Get ready to scream.
10	00:01:14	00:01:17	That was so awesome.
11	00:01:17	00:01:20	Um, we'll ride it in a minute.
12	00:01:20	00:01:25	Um, four King Tut burgers, uh, two Nile River ice teas and two milks.
13	00:01:25	00:01:28	Milk is nasty. Yeah.
14	00:01:58	00:02:02	So, Dr. Thrillseeker, you ever been on this roller coaster?
15	00:02:02	00:02:04	Pharaoh's Fever, yeah...
16	00:02:05	00:02:08	but my ride ended at the platform.
17	00:02:10	00:02:11	What do you know?
18	00:02:12	00:02:14	Six dead.
19	00:02:14	00:02:20	Park full of eyewitnesses saw the train fly off the tracks. 401B.
20	00:02:20	00:02:21	Accident with injury.
21	00:02:21	00:02:22	Uh-huh.
22	00:02:22	00:02:24	It's also a 418B.
23	00:02:24	00:02:27	A runaway?
24	00:02:28	00:02:30	A runaway train.
25	00:03:08	00:03:09	Hey.
26	00:03:09	00:03:10	Sorry we're late.
27	00:03:10	00:03:13	There was a news van blocking the entrance.
28	00:03:13	00:03:16	This is the first time a roller coaster has derailed in Clark County.
29	00:03:16	00:03:20	Huge criminal and civil liabilities issues, so keep it quiet.
30	00:03:20	00:03:22	Photograph the scene.
31	00:03:22	00:03:24	Bag and tag all the detritus.
32	00:03:25	00:03:26	Forklift anything bigger than Greg.
33	00:03:26	00:03:32	We're going to put up a tent on the other side of the parking lot for accident reconstruction. Questions?
34	00:03:32	00:03:37	Yeah. What's that guy doing so far away from the others?
35	00:03:38	00:03:41	Curious, isn't it?
36	00:03:41	00:03:46	So, when he asks if anybody has any questions, he's not really asking?
37	00:03:46	00:03:54	Well, I don't know much about roller coaster accidents, but in auto collisions, the victims found furthest away from the car usually weren't wearing a seat belt.
38	00:03:54	00:03:56	That'd be my bet.
39	00:04:01	00:04:04	Okay, let's go to work.
40	00:04:04	00:04:05	What should I do?
41	00:04:05	00:04:10	Photo-evidence log-- just record everything we collect, okay?
42	00:04:25	00:04:28	Couple of mountain bikers called in the body.
43	00:04:28	00:04:30	Coroner just arrived.
44	00:04:32	00:04:34	Hi, David.
45	00:04:34	00:04:36	Hey.
46	00:04:37	00:04:38	Tessa Press.
47	00:04:38	00:04:41	School I.D. was in her pocket.
48	00:04:41	00:04:42	She's 13.
49	00:04:42	00:04:45	I hate these cases.
50	00:04:45	00:04:50	Now... the body position is inconsistent with her lividity.
51	00:04:51	00:04:54	After she died, blood settled to her anterior and lividity fixed.
52	00:04:54	00:04:56	So she had been facedown.
53	00:04:56	00:04:57	Yeah.
54	00:04:58	00:05:00	And someone dumped her face up.
55	00:05:00	00:05:02	How long has she been here?
56	00:05:02	00:05:06	I'll defer that question to the insects.
57	00:05:12	00:05:13	Instar maggots.
58	00:05:14	00:05:20	Given the ambient temperature and last night's rain, I'd estimate she's been out here 24 hours.
59	00:05:20	00:05:24	Takes that long for blowfly eggs to hatch.
60	00:05:28	00:05:30	tire prints, shoe impressions.
61	00:05:30	00:05:32	Let's just hope there's some evidence on her body.
62	00:05:32	00:05:37	If you're going to drive all the way out here to dump a body, why not take another ten minutes and bury her?
63	00:05:37	00:05:41	Guess it wasn't worth the killer's time.
64	00:06:34	00:06:36	So, how long you been operating the roller coaster?
65	00:06:36	00:06:38	Couple of months. I got a promotion.
66	00:06:38	00:06:39	I used to work the merry-go-round.
67	00:06:40	00:06:41	That's a promotion, huh?
68	00:06:41	00:06:44	Yeah. Only little kids go on the merry-go-round.
69	00:06:44	00:06:48	Oh, I see. So you get to meet girls your own age on Pharaoh's Fever.
70	00:06:48	00:06:50	Yeah, something like that.
71	00:06:50	00:06:53	What kind of training do you get to be an operator?
72	00:06:53	00:06:55	Training? I release the brake.
73	00:06:55	00:06:57	I press a button.
74	00:06:57	00:06:58	It's green and marked start.
75	00:06:58	00:07:00	I get the picture.
76	00:07:00	00:07:01	All right, look, there are six victims.
77	00:07:01	00:07:04	It'd be helpful to know where each of them was sitting.
78	00:07:04	00:07:06	Um...
79	00:07:06	00:07:08	front bench was a girl.
80	00:07:08	00:07:09	She was blond.
81	00:07:09	00:07:11	Yeah? Cute.
82	00:07:14	00:07:18	Uh, followed by a punk, old folks and some other dude.
83	00:07:20	00:07:21	That's only five.
84	00:07:21	00:07:24	That's all I remember.
85	00:07:26	00:07:28	See yourself scream?
86	00:07:28	00:07:30	What's this about? We got a digital camera.
87	00:07:30	00:07:31	It's mounted right over there.
88	00:07:32	00:07:34	How does that work?
89	00:07:34	00:07:35	Camera's on a trigger.
90	00:07:35	00:07:40	Train passes by, automatically snaps a picture and stores it in the computer's hard drive.
91	00:07:40	00:07:41	The train was airborne.
92	00:07:41	00:07:44	Never even got close to the camera.
93	00:07:44	00:07:47	I'm still going to want to take that computer.
94	00:07:53	00:07:56	I'm the park's chief engineer.
95	00:07:56	00:08:00	Been working on coasters since before I was tall enough to ride 'em.
96	00:08:00	00:08:03	You responsible for maintaining this roller coaster?
97	00:08:03	00:08:04	I keep all the rides up to code.
98	00:08:04	00:08:08	You have any idea what would cause this train to go off the track?
99	00:08:08	00:08:10	Well, in theory, I didn't think it was possible.
100	00:08:10	00:08:12	There's never been an accident like this anywhere.
101	00:08:13	00:08:15	So, you're an expert?
102	00:08:15	00:08:17	On roller coasters? Hell yeah.
103	00:08:17	00:08:21	Ten years of service on Six Flags' American Eagle before moving to Vegas.
104	00:08:21	00:08:23	Do you know what that is?
105	00:08:23	00:08:27	That's a nut. It, uh... secures the wheel to the screw.
106	00:08:27	00:08:29	Well, one loose screw...
107	00:08:29	00:08:33	couldn't cause a train to derail, could it?
108	00:08:33	00:08:36	No, no, there's, uh... eight wheels per train.
109	00:08:36	00:08:38	They-they'd all have to be loose, and, uh...
110	00:08:38	00:08:40	that just doesn't happen.
111	00:08:52	00:08:55	There are three things in human life that are important.
112	00:08:55	00:09:04	The first is to be kind; the second one is to be kind; and the third one is to be kind.
113	00:09:04	00:09:05	Henry James.
114	00:09:05	00:09:10	Very good. Author of one of the greatest horror stories Turn of the Screw.
115	00:09:10	00:09:11	And I'm looking for one.
116	00:09:12	00:09:13	A screw? Yes.
117	00:09:13	00:09:15	Oh, well...
118	00:09:15	00:09:18	technically, these are eccentric shafts, not screws.
119	00:09:18	00:09:22	Well, as long as you can screw a nut on it, it's a screw.
120	00:09:23	00:09:24	Turn of the Screw isn't really a horror story.
121	00:09:25	00:09:26	It's more of a mystery.
122	00:09:26	00:09:28	Did the governess kill the little boy, or did the ghost do it?
123	00:09:28	00:09:31	Well, it's only a mystery if you believe in ghosts.
124	00:09:33	00:09:36	End threads are stripped.
125	00:09:36	00:09:37	Means the nuts were loose.
126	00:09:37	00:09:40	Excessive play on the screws would've worn down the threads.
127	00:09:40	00:09:42	And the nuts would've popped off.
128	00:09:47	00:09:50	Nuts don't just pop off by themselves.
129	00:09:53	00:09:55	We got tool marks.
130	00:09:55	00:09:59	Vertical striations, evenly spaced.
131	00:09:59	00:10:01	Could've been a pipe wrench.
132	00:10:01	00:10:05	Maybe whoever maintains the roller coaster uses a pipe wrench to tighten the nuts.
133	00:10:05	00:10:09	Or whoever loosened the nuts screwed up.
134	00:10:19	00:10:23	It's Tessa.
135	00:10:23	00:10:26	I don't understand.
136	00:10:28	00:10:29	How could this...?
137	00:10:34	00:10:36	My baby.
138	00:10:39	00:10:42	I'm very sorry.
139	00:10:43	00:10:46	She's beautiful, isn't she?
140	00:10:48	00:10:54	Ma'am, the coroner believes that Tessa died over 24 hours ago.
141	00:10:54	00:10:56	Had you reported her missing?
142	00:10:58	00:11:02	Couple nights a week, she'd sleep at her friend Carrie's.
143	00:11:02	00:11:06	There's just the two of us.
144	00:11:06	00:11:09	I'm a waitress. Work nights.
145	00:11:09	00:11:11	That way I can...
146	00:11:11	00:11:16	make her breakfast and be there when she gets home from school.
147	00:11:17	00:11:20	When was the last time that you saw her?
148	00:11:20	00:11:22	Yesterday morning.
149	00:11:22	00:11:26	00.
150	00:11:26	00:11:29	We made pancakes.
151	00:11:30	00:11:33	I packed her lunch and kissed her good-bye.
152	00:11:37	00:11:42	When she didn't come home from school, I just figured she was at Carrie's.
153	00:11:45	00:11:51	I should have called, but I didn't want to be a nag.
154	00:11:54	00:11:56	I want to see her.
155	00:11:58	00:12:04	Officer, could you please escort Ms. Press... to the morgue.
156	00:12:20	00:12:24	When's the last time you went 24 hours without talking to Lindsey?
157	00:12:24	00:12:26	A single mother, working nights.
158	00:12:26	00:12:30	I'm just saying, she didn't check on her own kid, you know?
159	00:12:30	00:12:34	Ah, you do the best you can.
160	00:12:34	00:12:36	Introductions.
161	00:12:38	00:12:39	Shelly Hoffman, 25.
162	00:12:39	00:12:42	Cause of death-- lacerated ventricle.
163	00:12:42	00:12:43	Noah Nuland, 15.
164	00:12:44	00:12:46	C.O.D.-- head contusion.
165	00:12:46	00:12:49	The swelling of the brain killed him within minutes.
166	00:12:49	00:12:53	Now, Gary Clodfelter died of shock.
167	00:12:53	00:12:55	His wife, May, exsanguinated.
168	00:12:55	00:13:00	And their son, Cameron-- another head contusion.
169	00:13:00	00:13:03	What about this guy?
170	00:13:03	00:13:04	Jim Nevins, 20.
171	00:13:04	00:13:06	Park employee.
172	00:13:06	00:13:09	Died from a temporal herniation.
173	00:13:09	00:13:14	Impact to the head caused the brain to swell, which, in turn, put pressure on the brain stem.
174	00:13:14	00:13:19	According to the ride operator, there were only five passengers on the roller coaster, and no employees.
175	00:13:19	00:13:22	Right. So...
176	00:13:22	00:13:25	maybe Nevins was just an unfortunate bystander.
177	00:13:25	00:13:28	Hit in the head by a falling roller coaster.
178	00:13:28	00:13:30	The Chicken Little theory?
179	00:13:30	00:13:31	But here's the hitch.
180	00:13:32	00:13:34	The others died roughly ten hours ago.
181	00:13:34	00:13:37	Mr. Nevins' rigor mortis is fixed.
182	00:13:37	00:13:43	Body temp puts the time of his death approximately 16 hours before the others-- 00 A.M.
183	00:13:46	00:13:51	Albert... dead men don't ride roller coasters.
184	00:13:56	00:13:59	We're going to need to see the underside of the loading platform.
185	00:13:59	00:14:00	Oh, follow me.
186	00:14:00	00:14:04	Rumor has it the park's going to shut down Pharaoh's Fever for good.
187	00:14:04	00:14:05	You know anything about that?
188	00:14:05	00:14:07	No.
189	00:14:07	00:14:09	Newspaper called it a death trap.
190	00:14:09	00:14:11	An accident waiting to happen.
191	00:14:11	00:14:12	You disagree with that?
192	00:14:12	00:14:16	Well, she's old and wrinkled, but I took good care of her.
193	00:14:20	00:14:21	Uh, Woody?
194	00:14:22	00:14:23	We'd like to be alone.
195	00:14:25	00:14:26	Holler if you need anything.
196	00:14:48	00:14:51	Well, easy access.
197	00:14:51	00:14:54	Wheels are in reach.
198	00:14:54	00:14:57	Anyone could have loosened the nuts from down here.
199	00:14:57	00:15:00	Check this out.
200	00:15:00	00:15:02	Is that lubricant, maybe?
201	00:15:02	00:15:03	It's a funny place for lubricant.
202	00:15:03	00:15:04	It's not even on the track.
203	00:15:04	00:15:06	I'll swab it.
204	00:15:12	00:15:15	Hey, look at that.
205	00:15:17	00:15:19	That's worse than just a wrinkle.
206	00:15:19	00:15:21	It's got a support beam under it.
207	00:15:21	00:15:22	It's just a cosmetic problem.
208	00:15:22	00:15:24	Sir, you need to step away.
209	00:15:24	00:15:26	We need some time.
210	00:15:26	00:15:29	This is an active investigation.
211	00:15:29	00:15:33	Were you aware that that support beam was detached?
212	00:15:33	00:15:34	Well, hell, yeah.
213	00:15:34	00:15:36	Fixed it a half dozen times this year.
214	00:15:36	00:15:37	It's in my maintenance log.
215	00:15:37	00:15:41	But like I said, that cross bar is supported by the metal beam.
216	00:15:41	00:15:45	But since my hours were cut back last November, I've had to prioritize my fix-ums.
217	00:15:45	00:15:47	Hmm.
218	00:15:47	00:15:51	Woody, we'd like to requisition your pipe wrench.
219	00:15:51	00:15:53	It's, uh, not technically mine.
220	00:15:53	00:15:55	Are you the only one that uses it?
221	00:15:55	00:15:58	Yeah, but it's the property of the park.
222	00:15:58	00:16:00	Well, I promise we'll get it back to you.
223	00:16:04	00:16:06	Thank you.
224	00:16:07	00:16:09	Yeah?
225	00:16:09	00:16:12	I'm processing the dead park employee's clothing.
226	00:16:12	00:16:15	The shirt and the pants are covered in red fibers.
227	00:16:15	00:16:17	Anything distinctive?
228	00:16:17	00:16:21	Well, they're trilobal.
229	00:16:21	00:16:22	Very good.
230	00:16:22	00:16:23	Thanks, Nick.
231	00:16:23	00:16:29	Well, we need to find a car with a red interior.
232	00:16:29	00:16:31	Hi.
233	00:16:33	00:16:35	The roller coaster broke into 106 parts.
234	00:16:35	00:16:37	I just logged the final piece.
235	00:16:37	00:16:39	Good work.
236	00:16:39	00:16:42	I found something a little unusual, for a roller coaster.
237	00:16:47	00:16:50	Not a sailor, but a...
238	00:16:50	00:16:52	Semen?
239	00:16:52	00:16:53	Sex on the roller coaster?
240	00:16:54	00:16:56	Or some kid shaking hands with Shorty.
241	00:16:58	00:17:05	The release of epinephrine and adrenaline while riding a roller coaster can produce a stimulatory effect.
242	00:17:05	00:17:07	It enhances ejaculation.
243	00:17:07	00:17:10	Right. But is it probative to our investigation?
244	00:17:10	00:17:15	Well, um, why don't you swab a sample, and you can tell us.
245	00:17:15	00:17:18	Greg, do we know who the R.O. of this T-Bird is?
246	00:17:18	00:17:19	Uh...
247	00:17:19	00:17:21	Jim Nevins.
248	00:17:21	00:17:23	The dead employee.
249	00:17:23	00:17:26	I didn't realize the cars were relevant to our investigation.
250	00:17:26	00:17:30	Everything's relevant Greg, until it's not.
251	00:17:36	00:17:38	Grissom.
252	00:17:43	00:17:45	Take a look at this.
253	00:17:45	00:17:47	A pipe wrench.
254	00:17:50	00:17:52	Blood.
255	00:17:52	00:17:54	Greg, may I?
256	00:18:01	00:18:04	Blood pool.
257	00:18:04	00:18:07	Camouflaged by the red carpet.
258	00:18:07	00:18:10	That explains the autopsy findings.
259	00:18:10	00:18:13	Nevins may have never been in the roller coaster.
260	00:18:13	00:18:17	Possibly killed by that wrench and stuffed in his own trunk.
261	00:18:17	00:18:18	And, uh, then what?
262	00:18:18	00:18:24	A renegade roller coaster comes along 16 hours later, and propels Nevin's body from the trunk to the blacktop?
263	00:18:24	00:18:25	I'm just following the evidence.
264	00:18:26	00:18:31	I'll call Brass, see if he can find an eyewitness that can place the car in the parking lot at the time of Nevin's death.
265	00:18:35	00:18:38	Uh, so, Woody said that I might be able to help you with your investigation.
266	00:18:38	00:18:41	Zack, you close up shop at the Sphinx at night.
267	00:18:41	00:18:42	Yeah, Monday to Friday.
268	00:18:42	00:18:43	00.
269	00:18:44	00:18:47	00, and then I head over to the park.
270	00:18:47	00:18:48	00.
271	00:18:48	00:18:54	Did you notice any cars in the parking lot after closing on Thursday night?
272	00:18:54	00:18:57	Jimmy Nevins. His red T-Bird was out there.
273	00:18:57	00:18:58	Oh, you know Jimmy?
274	00:18:58	00:19:00	Yeah, sure; pretty cool guy.
275	00:19:00	00:19:01	Worked the bumper cars.
276	00:19:01	00:19:05	I still can't believe what happened, you know?
277	00:19:05	00:19:09	I mean, I must have rode that coaster, like, 100 times, maybe more.
278	00:19:09	00:19:12	Anyway, sometimes Jimmy stayed after closing.
279	00:19:12	00:19:14	Why?
280	00:19:14	00:19:21	Look, I'm not trying to get anybody in trouble, but occasionally, Jimmy would take his... dates for rides on The Fever, you know?
281	00:19:21	00:19:23	Everybody knew about it. It was really no big deal.
282	00:19:23	00:19:26	Do you happen to know the name of his date on Thursday night?
283	00:19:26	00:19:28	No, sorry.
284	00:19:28	00:19:30	How did Jimmy get access to the park?
285	00:19:30	00:19:33	I mean, all the power is shut down at night.
286	00:19:33	00:19:37	The same key that opens up the men's room door opens up all the power boxes at the park.
287	00:19:37	00:19:38	No kidding.
288	00:19:38	00:19:40	It's just hanging outside Woody's office.
289	00:19:40	00:19:42	What about security?
290	00:19:42	00:19:45	Nope. Night guy got laid off.
291	00:19:45	00:19:46	Budget cuts last winter.
292	00:19:46	00:19:50	It's not like anybody's going break into an amusement park and steal a coaster, you know?
293	00:19:51	00:19:53	X-rayed Tessa's neck.
294	00:19:53	00:19:59	Blade appears to have perforated her fifth cervical intervertebral disc, lacerating the spinal cord.
295	00:20:01	00:20:06	Type of trauma suggests we're looking at asphyxia due to diaphragmatic paralysis.
296	00:20:09	00:20:13	It looks like there's soil inside of her wound.
297	00:20:13	00:20:15	Well, we did find her outside.
298	00:20:15	00:20:18	Right.
299	00:20:18	00:20:21	Should be soil around the wound.
300	00:20:21	00:20:25	And on the wound, but not inside of it.
301	00:21:37	00:21:39	Oh, I am the man.
302	00:21:39	00:21:41	Are you?
303	00:21:41	00:21:45	I microsilled the pipe wrenches you and Sara turned into evidence.
304	00:21:45	00:21:48	I excluded Woody's wrench.
305	00:21:48	00:21:51	Take a look at the tool marks from the wrench found in the T-bird.
306	00:21:51	00:21:52	On the left, the sabotaged nut.
307	00:21:52	00:21:55	On the right, the test marks.
308	00:21:55	00:21:57	Perfect match.
309	00:21:57	00:21:58	I have a theory.
310	00:21:58	00:22:01	Maybe Jim Nevins sabotaged the roller coaster.
311	00:22:06	00:22:11	When he left the park, someone attacked him, grabbed his wrench and hit him over the head with it.
312	00:22:18	00:22:19	Did you any prints off the wrench?
313	00:22:19	00:22:20	I got a partial.
314	00:22:21	00:22:22	And I had a tech print the T-Bird.
315	00:22:22	00:22:25	Found two sets of prints on the trunk's lid.
316	00:22:25	00:22:30	One belonged to the vic, the other unknown, but it did match the partial.
317	00:22:32	00:22:38	That semen from the coaster's cab was just processed in my lab.
318	00:22:38	00:22:40	All I can say is, Nevins was a cad.
319	00:22:41	00:22:43	Semen match the dead guy's?
320	00:22:43	00:22:48	Yup. And Sara spoke to Brass, who says Nevins was known for taking girls on private rides.
321	00:22:48	00:22:50	Pharaoh's Fever was his Spanish fly.
322	00:22:50	00:22:53	Well, there goes my theory.
323	00:22:53	00:22:56	No one tampers with their sex machine.
324	00:23:01	00:23:03	Multitrack digital camera snaps photos of all the passengers.
325	00:23:03	00:23:07	The park finally sent over their computer, so I'm scanning through the day of the accident.
326	00:23:08	00:23:10	Can you go back in time, to the night before?
327	00:23:10	00:23:12	Yeah. Why?
328	00:23:12	00:23:14	Jim Nevins may have been on that coaster.
329	00:23:14	00:23:16	I want to see if anyone was with him.
330	00:23:23	00:23:25	Oh. So much for safe sex.
331	00:23:25	00:23:27	Who's the girl?
332	00:23:27	00:23:28	Reverse one more pic.
333	00:23:32	00:23:35	Now, that picture's worth five bucks.
334	00:23:35	00:23:39	45 a.m.
335	00:23:39	00:23:41	00 a.m.
336	00:23:41	00:23:43	We need to find that girl.
337	00:23:47	00:23:49	Hey.
338	00:23:49	00:23:50	Hey.
339	00:23:50	00:23:52	Got your page. What's up?
340	00:23:52	00:23:55	Tessa Press took the bus to and from school, not far from here. Mm-hmm.
341	00:23:56	00:23:57	I showed her picture to the mini-mart manager.
342	00:23:58	00:24:00	She remembers seeing her the day that she was killed.
343	00:24:00	00:24:02	Wow.
344	00:24:02	00:24:04	This place is crawling with kids.
345	00:24:04	00:24:05	She remembers her?
346	00:24:05	00:24:09	She says she came in every afternoon and bought a Little Debbie and a soda.
347	00:24:09	00:24:11	Have we tracked down her friend, Carrie?
348	00:24:11	00:24:18	Officer Ray did speak with Carrie and her parents, and they confirmed that Tessa spent at least two nights a week over their place.
349	00:24:18	00:24:20	And was she supposed to sleep over the day that she was killed?
350	00:24:20	00:24:21	I don't think they had any kind of a schedule.
351	00:24:22	00:24:25	She would just show up, and when she didn't, they'd assumed that she was at home.
352	00:24:26	00:24:27	Warrick.
353	00:24:27	00:24:29	I've already secured the footage.
354	00:24:43	00:24:46	00.
355	00:24:47	00:24:49	I heard you were looking for someone.
356	00:24:49	00:24:51	Sir, do you recognize this young woman?
357	00:24:53	00:24:55	Oh, sure, it's Cleopatra.
358	00:24:56	00:24:57	She works in food services.
359	00:24:57	00:24:59	Second pyramid on the left.
360	00:24:59	00:25:01	Thank you, Woody.
361	00:25:10	00:25:11	Hey, can I help you?
362	00:25:11	00:25:13	Actually, we're looking for Cleopatra.
363	00:25:13	00:25:14	She's on break.
364	00:25:14	00:25:16	But can I get you anything?
365	00:25:17	00:25:19	No, thanks.
366	00:25:24	00:25:26	Quadratic equations?
367	00:25:26	00:25:29	That's not easy.
368	00:25:29	00:25:31	Glad you think so.
369	00:25:31	00:25:32	I have a D average.
370	00:25:32	00:25:35	If I fail the final, my family's going to Hawaii without me.
371	00:25:35	00:25:36	We're with the crime lab.
372	00:25:40	00:25:42	We have some questions.
373	00:25:45	00:25:49	I had no idea those cameras worked at night.
374	00:25:49	00:25:51	Is your name really Cleopatra?
375	00:25:51	00:25:53	Lisa. Lisa Hunt.
376	00:25:53	00:25:57	Lisa, you know your friend in this photograph is dead, right?
377	00:25:57	00:26:00	Right.
378	00:26:00	00:26:02	You don't seem too upset about that.
379	00:26:04	00:26:09	Four years ago, when I was a frosh and he was a senior, he was my Jordan Catalano.
380	00:26:09	00:26:11	Know what I mean?
381	00:26:11	00:26:13	But he didn't know my name.
382	00:26:13	00:26:24	So four years later, when I started working here, he's still working here-- total loser, but still really hot-- When and where?
383	00:26:24	00:26:26	After hours at the roller coaster.
384	00:26:26	00:26:30	I know, I thought the same thing-- Cheez Whiz.
385	00:26:30	00:26:32	But, I mean, what the hell?
386	00:26:32	00:26:34	I'd never done it on a roller coaster.
387	00:26:35	00:26:36	It was your first date.
388	00:26:37	00:26:39	You sound like my mother.
389	00:26:39	00:26:42	Oh, God, you're not going to tell her, are you?
390	00:26:42	00:26:43	I just turned 18.
391	00:26:43	00:26:45	There is nothing statutory about it, I swear.
392	00:26:45	00:26:50	Lisa, we need to know what the two of you did when you got off the ride.
393	00:26:50	00:26:51	We talked.
394	00:26:51	00:26:54	I mean, not that he had much to say.
395	00:26:55	00:27:01	He offered to drive me home, but I only live a few blocks from here, so I told him I'd huff it.
396	00:27:01	00:27:04	Mm, we kissed-- way too much slobber.
397	00:27:04	00:27:06	And that was it.
398	00:27:06	00:27:08	Was there anyone else around?
399	00:27:08	00:27:11	I-I didn't see anybody, but I wasn't really looking.
400	00:27:19	00:27:22	I found Tessa.
401	00:27:22	00:27:24	Yeah, you're not the only one.
402	00:27:24	00:27:25	Yeah.
403	00:27:25	00:27:27	Can you enlarge it?
404	00:27:37	00:27:39	Yeah, that's me.
405	00:27:39	00:27:40	And who's that with you?
406	00:27:40	00:27:41	Tessa Press.
407	00:27:41	00:27:43	You two were friends?
408	00:27:43	00:27:45	We sat next to each other on the bus.
409	00:27:45	00:27:47	She was 13.
410	00:27:47	00:27:48	How old are you?
411	00:27:48	00:27:49	What's that supposed to mean?
412	00:27:49	00:27:52	No, Mom, it's okay.
413	00:27:52	00:27:54	I-I'm 15.
414	00:27:54	00:27:56	I felt sorry for her.
415	00:27:56	00:27:57	The girls picked on her.
416	00:27:57	00:27:59	Made fun of her frizzy hair, her old clothes.
417	00:27:59	00:28:00	Stuff like that.
418	00:28:01	00:28:05	She'd sit next to me, and they'd leave her alone.
419	00:28:05	00:28:07	In the photo, you're grabbing her arm.
420	00:28:07	00:28:08	It wasn't like that.
421	00:28:08	00:28:10	I just got my learner's permit.
422	00:28:10	00:28:12	My mom was waiting in the car.
423	00:28:12	00:28:14	We were just going to get slushies.
424	00:28:14	00:28:16	I saw Tessa in the parking lot.
425	00:28:16	00:28:17	Hey, Tessa. Hey.
426	00:28:17	00:28:18	Henry.
427	00:28:18	00:28:20	You want a ride, just door to door?
428	00:28:20	00:28:22	No, that's okay.
429	00:28:22	00:28:24	Oh, come on. You're not scared to drive with me, are you?
430	00:28:24	00:28:27	No, it's okay. I got it.
431	00:28:27	00:28:29	She said she was getting a ride from someone else.
432	00:28:29	00:28:31	Did she say who?
433	00:28:32	00:28:33	No.
434	00:28:33	00:28:37	But when we pulled away, I saw her getting into a truck.
435	00:28:37	00:28:39	I didn't see the driver.
436	00:28:44	00:28:46	I've got a question for you.
437	00:28:50	00:28:58	Sorbitol, cetyl alcohol, isopropyl myristate, glyceryl, stearate, PEG-100 stearate, petrolatum, benzylalcohol, titanium dioxide and purified water?
438	00:28:58	00:29:03	Okay, I assume that you've identified the substance we found on the roller coaster track?
439	00:29:03	00:29:04	Correct.
440	00:29:05	00:29:07	It's doxepin ointment.
441	00:29:07	00:29:09	Sounds Klingon, huh?
442	00:29:11	00:29:19	Anyway, uh, it's prescribed by doctors to treat dermatological inflammations caused by contact with certain types of plants.
443	00:29:19	00:29:23	Maybe whoever messed with the tracks transferred the ointment when they loosened the wheels.
444	00:29:26	00:29:28	Your killer has a rash.
445	00:29:28	00:29:31	And we need to catch it.
446	00:29:35	00:29:37	I've been looking for you.
447	00:29:37	00:29:38	What's up?
448	00:29:38	00:29:41	Hodges analyzed the trace from inside Tessa's wound.
449	00:29:41	00:29:43	It seems it was ZooDoo.
450	00:29:43	00:29:44	Come again.
451	00:29:44	00:29:45	Hoof stock.
452	00:29:46	00:29:48	It's a combination of feces from rhinos, zebras, and bison.
453	00:29:48	00:29:50	You're kidding?
454	00:29:50	00:29:53	They say that the smell of wild animal crap keeps the deer away.
455	00:29:53	00:29:55	Who knew?
456	00:29:55	00:29:57	Uh, so can we track the source of...?
457	00:29:58	00:30:01	There is a zoo in Auckland that exports it.
458	00:30:01	00:30:05	And there's only one landscaping company in Clark County that imports it-- ADL.
459	00:30:05	00:30:07	I contacted ADL, and guess what they told me?
460	00:30:07	00:30:12	Couple of months back, they were hired by the victim's mother.
461	00:30:20	00:30:21	Hmm.
462	00:30:21	00:30:22	ADL Landscaping.
463	00:30:24	00:30:29	Must've been a big job-- she hired them months ago.
464	00:30:31	00:30:33	ZooDoo.
465	00:30:41	00:30:43	Hello.
466	00:30:43	00:30:44	Hi.
467	00:30:45	00:30:46	I just left you a message.
468	00:30:46	00:30:48	Any news?
469	00:30:50	00:30:53	Honey, these guys are from the crime lab.
470	00:30:53	00:30:54	Justin Mack, my boyfriend.
471	00:30:55	00:30:57	How you doing?
472	00:30:57	00:30:58	Hey.
473	00:30:58	00:31:00	Could I have a word with you outside for a moment?
474	00:31:00	00:31:01	Why?
475	00:31:01	00:31:02	Why not?
476	00:31:10	00:31:13	May I?
477	00:31:13	00:31:17	How can you be sure it was Justin's truck?
478	00:31:17	00:31:20	At this point, we're just following a lead.
479	00:31:20	00:31:24	How long have you known Justin?
480	00:31:24	00:31:28	Uh... few months.
481	00:31:29	00:31:31	Hired him to lay sod.
482	00:31:31	00:31:34	Now we're in the midst of an outdoor overhaul.
483	00:31:34	00:31:37	And where's Tessa's father?
484	00:31:37	00:31:38	L.A., maybe. I don't know.
485	00:31:39	00:31:41	I haven't heard from him since the divorce.
486	00:31:42	00:31:44	He'll find a way to blame me for this.
487	00:31:45	00:31:48	You see, Raina said it was important for Tessa to take the bus to school.
488	00:31:48	00:31:50	Said it helps build independence.
489	00:31:50	00:31:56	But sometimes I'd pick her up at the bus stop, buy her an ice-cream cone, and drop her off here.
490	00:31:56	00:31:58	Did you pick her up that afternoon?
491	00:31:58	00:32:03	Look, I know there are a lot of whack-jobs in the world, and you're just doing your job, but watch it.
492	00:32:04	00:32:06	You mind if I take a look in the back of your truck?
493	00:32:07	00:32:10	Don't you need a warrant?
494	00:32:10	00:32:12	Only if you deny me access.
495	00:32:12	00:32:13	Go ahead.
496	00:32:13	00:32:15	Thanks.
497	00:32:15	00:32:18	Have you ever left Tessa alone with Justin?
498	00:32:18	00:32:19	Sure.
499	00:32:19	00:32:20	He's over here all the time.
500	00:32:21	00:32:24	He's a good man.
501	00:32:24	00:32:28	He wouldn't hurt anybody, especially not Tessa.
502	00:32:30	00:32:35	Damn, I keep expecting her to walk through that door.
503	00:33:09	00:33:14	In 1988, your client was arrested for a drunk and disorderly.
504	00:33:14	00:33:17	Your fingerprints were then entered into our database.
505	00:33:17	00:33:20	They match the fingerprints that we found on this shovel.
506	00:33:22	00:33:29	The blood on the blade matches your daughter's DNA.
507	00:33:29	00:33:32	My client is landscaping her backyard with her boyfriend.
508	00:33:33	00:33:35	Explains her prints on his shovel.
509	00:33:35	00:33:38	They were the only prints on the shovel.
510	00:33:38	00:33:40	Justin wears work gloves.
511	00:33:40	00:33:43	Which explains the absence of his prints.
512	00:33:43	00:33:45	That's possible.
513	00:33:45	00:33:49	But your client's fingerprints provided a sufficient basis for a warrant to search her vehicle.
514	00:34:00	00:34:10	The choice of weapon and the manner of disposal suggest that this was not a premeditated murder.
515	00:34:14	00:34:16	You can help yourself here.
516	00:34:16	00:34:20	You can avoid Murder One by telling us what set you off.
517	00:34:22	00:34:24	You wouldn't understand.
518	00:34:24	00:34:26	Try me.
519	00:34:26	00:34:36	I bought Tessa a bus pass, and that little slut still gets my guy to pick her up after school.
520	00:34:36	00:34:38	Raina... Shut up!
521	00:34:40	00:34:41	We all know why.
522	00:34:41	00:34:43	Why don't you tell us?
523	00:34:43	00:34:46	She was trying to steal him from me.
524	00:34:52	00:34:55	Bye, thanks Justin.
525	00:34:57	00:35:00	What the hell were you doing with him?
526	00:35:00	00:35:02	Mom, he just gave me a ride home.
527	00:35:02	00:35:04	You think you got him wrapped around your little finger?
528	00:35:04	00:35:05	He's just being nice, okay?
529	00:35:05	00:35:07	Were you nice back?
530	00:35:07	00:35:09	Don't do this again, please!
531	00:35:09	00:35:11	You don't talk to me like that, you little bitch.
532	00:35:11	00:35:13	Mom, you're being ridiculous.
533	00:35:13	00:35:19	Where the hell do you think you're going? I've given you everything.
534	00:35:23	00:35:26	Justin was the best thing in my life.
535	00:35:27	00:35:29	No.
536	00:35:29	00:35:35	Your daughter was the best thing in your life.
537	00:35:37	00:35:39	You didn't know her.
538	00:35:42	00:35:44	I know she was 13 years old.
539	00:35:44	00:35:47	A child.
540	00:35:52	00:35:55	I just got the court order from the pharmaceutical database.
541	00:35:55	00:35:57	Fortunately, Dioxipin isn't widely prescribed.
542	00:35:57	00:36:02	FDA only approved it two years ago, and most dermatologists don't even know what it is.
543	00:36:02	00:36:04	How many names on the list?
544	00:36:04	00:36:07	Well, in Clark County, twelve prescriptions were filled.
545	00:36:07	00:36:11	I cross-referenced them with the employees from the Park, and I got a hit.
546	00:36:11	00:36:12	You want a clue?
547	00:36:12	00:36:18	Her death ended the Ptolemy dynasty's reign in Ancient Egypt, hence making her the last Pharaoh.
548	00:36:18	00:36:21	Ah, the lovely Cleopatra.
549	00:36:21	00:36:22	I had a rash.
550	00:36:22	00:36:24	So what?
551	00:36:24	00:36:25	That's not a crime.
552	00:36:25	00:36:26	I read the court order.
553	00:36:26	00:36:30	Uh, you found trace amounts of some ointment on the roller coaster tracks?
554	00:36:30	00:36:32	Is that the only reason for this conversation?
555	00:36:32	00:36:35	Your client had a prescription for doxepin.
556	00:36:38	00:36:40	May we see your arms, please?
557	00:36:40	00:36:41	Rash was on my legs.
558	00:36:41	00:36:43	Went away days ago.
559	00:36:43	00:36:44	You want to see?
560	00:36:45	00:36:46	Uh, that's okay.
561	00:36:46	00:36:51	Unless you want to argue that my client stood on her head and held a wrench in her toes, we're done here.
562	00:36:51	00:36:53	Do you know how you contracted the rash, Lisa?
563	00:36:53	00:36:57	Best guess, I was getting some help with my homework.
564	00:36:57	00:36:59	We were studying outside on the grass.
565	00:36:59	00:37:01	Took a break, went for a walk.
566	00:37:01	00:37:03	I think I brushed up against something.
567	00:37:03	00:37:05	Who's we?
568	00:37:05	00:37:06	My math tutor.
569	00:37:06	00:37:08	And what's his name?
570	00:37:08	00:37:10	Zack Lawrence.
571	00:37:14	00:37:16	Do you know if he contracted the rash, as well?
572	00:37:16	00:37:19	Yeah. Actually, I gave him some of my ointment.
573	00:37:23	00:37:25	Hey, Zack.
574	00:37:25	00:37:28	Oh, hey, guys.
575	00:37:28	00:37:29	We spoke with Lisa.
576	00:37:29	00:37:33	She said she gave you some ointment for some nasty rash you have.
577	00:37:33	00:37:36	You know, it's illegal to use someone else's prescription medications.
578	00:37:36	00:37:38	Is that why you guys are here?
579	00:37:38	00:37:40	Not exactly.
580	00:37:42	00:37:44	Um, you guys mind if we talk about this somewhere else?
581	00:37:45	00:37:45	Hey, good idea.
582	00:37:46	00:37:47	Why don't we go downtown?
583	00:37:47	00:37:48	We can talk there.
584	00:37:48	00:37:50	Come on. Come on.
585	00:37:50	00:37:52	All right.
586	00:37:52	00:37:54	You coming?
587	00:37:54	00:37:57	You know, I'm going to catch up.
588	00:37:57	00:37:58	Okay.
589	00:38:24	00:38:27	Yeah, it's, uh, just a little bit of a rash.
590	00:38:27	00:38:29	It's really no big deal.
591	00:38:29	00:38:31	Zack, what do you have against roller coasters?
592	00:38:31	00:38:32	What do...?
593	00:38:32	00:38:34	I-I don't understand.
594	00:38:34	00:38:36	This a fingerprint analysis.
595	00:38:36	00:38:40	Zack, I lifted some fingerprints off your broom back at the Park.
596	00:38:40	00:38:45	Turns out, they're a match to prints that we lifted off of Jim Nevins' T-Bird and the wrench that was used to kill him.
597	00:38:45	00:38:47	Circumstantial evidence at best.
598	00:38:47	00:38:49	I also talked to your school principal.
599	00:38:49	00:38:51	You're a straight A student, Mathalete.
600	00:38:51	00:38:52	Science Team.
601	00:38:52	00:38:54	You had a full ride to Stanford next year.
602	00:38:54	00:38:59	You don't sound like the kind of kid that would mess with a roller coaster just for kicks.
603	00:39:01	00:39:02	You're a smart guy, Zack.
604	00:39:02	00:39:04	So, uh...
605	00:39:04	00:39:08	let's talk this out, logically.
606	00:39:08	00:39:17	According to your previous statement, when you locked up on Thursday night, Jim Nevins' car was the only one in the parking lot, right?
607	00:39:17	00:39:19	Yes, sir, that's correct.
608	00:39:19	00:39:22	And you knew he was staying in the park to ride the roller coaster.
609	00:39:22	00:39:25	I don't care about Jim Nevins.
610	00:39:25	00:39:28	What about Lisa Hunt?
611	00:39:28	00:39:31	You tutor her, right?
612	00:39:31	00:39:33	Did Lisa tell you that she had a date with Jim?
613	00:39:33	00:39:35	No, she didn't say anything.
614	00:39:35	00:39:37	It was all over the park.
615	00:39:37	00:39:41	Jim was going to take Lisa on one of his coaster dates.
616	00:39:42	00:39:43	I asked her about it.
617	00:39:44	00:39:45	She said it was a rumor.
618	00:39:45	00:39:49	It seems to matter to you that she had a date with Jim.
619	00:39:49	00:39:53	Lady, I make $20 an hour tutoring.
620	00:39:53	00:39:56	Why do you think I'd take minimum wage at The Sphinx?
621	00:39:56	00:40:00	I'm thinking, you want Lisa to see you away from the textbooks.
622	00:40:01	00:40:03	We started hanging out at breaks.
623	00:40:03	00:40:05	Having dinner.
624	00:40:07	00:40:10	And then last week, after tutoring, we went for a walk.
625	00:40:10	00:40:13	And she grabbed my hand.
626	00:40:13	00:40:16	Did you think that meant something?
627	00:40:16	00:40:18	Of course.
628	00:40:18	00:40:20	But...
629	00:40:20	00:40:23	you didn't trust her.
630	00:40:24	00:40:26	No. I wanted to.
631	00:40:39	00:40:41	You tampered with the screws.
632	00:40:41	00:40:44	If she wasn't lying, she wouldn't be on the roller coaster.
633	00:40:44	00:40:45	No harm, no foul.
634	00:40:45	00:40:48	Oh, but you see, she was lying.
635	00:40:48	00:40:49	Uh-huh.
636	00:40:51	00:40:53	But you didn't loosen the wheels enough, did you?
637	00:40:53	00:40:55	Don't answer that.
638	00:40:55	00:41:02	So when the roller coaster didn't derail, you took things into your own hands.
639	00:41:12	00:41:14	Lisa walked home.
640	00:41:14	00:41:16	Jim walked over to his car.
641	00:41:22	00:41:26	What I don't understand is why you didn't go back and fix the roller coaster.
642	00:41:28	00:41:30	Guess I just didn't think about it.
643	00:41:30	00:41:32	You'll be thinking about it now.
644	00:41:33	00:41:35	And for the rest of your life.
645	00:41:41	00:41:44	I should have caught those loose screws.
646	00:41:44	00:41:48	Used to check 'em every morning, but since management cut back on my hours...
647	00:41:48	00:41:50	You're not to blame for this, Woody.
648	00:41:50	00:41:53	Oh, I just hope they don't blame the coaster.
649	00:41:53	00:41:58	It may not be the Manhattan Express at New York, New York or the Desperado in Primm, but it-it...
650	00:41:58	00:42:00	It still makes grown men scream.
651	00:42:00	00:42:03	My first week in Vegas, I road the Desperado.
652	00:42:03	00:42:05	My first coaster marathon.
653	00:42:05	00:42:07	I rode that monster for a week straight.
654	00:42:07	00:42:08	Hmm.
655	00:42:08	00:42:12	The Steel Phantom, Kennywood Park, Pennsylvania-- I actually hold the marathon record there.
656	00:42:12	00:42:14	Uh, uh.
657	00:42:14	00:42:17	My-My favorite's still the, um, King's Island.
658	00:42:17	00:42:18	The Beast.
659	00:42:18	00:42:19	Mm.
660	00:42:19	00:42:24	I presented a paper at an Entomology convention in Cincinnati just so I could ride Son of Beast.
661	00:42:24	00:42:26	Head over heels on a wooden track.
662	00:42:26	00:42:29	Ah. So, you prefer wood over steel?
663	00:42:29	00:42:32	No. Not really.
664	00:42:32	00:42:34	For me, it's not about the track.
665	00:42:34	00:42:37	It's about the thrill.
