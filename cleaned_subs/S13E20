0,00:00:03,00:00:06,MAN: How does an eagle fly?
1,00:00:06,00:00:08,With wings?
2,00:00:08,00:00:12,I don't know. Ask the chicken how that's working out.
3,00:00:12,00:00:16,An eagle flies because it is fearless.
4,00:00:16,00:00:22,"Using its force of mind, the eagle is the lord of the sky."
5,00:00:24,00:00:32,My name is Alan Quinn and I believe that you are all eagles.
6,00:00:34,00:00:35,"Thank you, friends."
7,00:00:35,00:00:39,Thank you for visiting this sacred paradise.
8,00:00:39,00:00:46,"If you join my week-long ""Force Of Mind"" seminar, you... will... conquer... fire."
9,00:00:46,00:00:49,Your fears will vanish.
10,00:00:49,00:00:55,"Your work, your relationship, everything in your life will be enriched."
11,00:00:56,00:00:58,Now who wants to come fly with me?
12,00:00:58,00:01:01,Come on! I don't see every hand up.
13,00:01:01,00:01:03,Who wants to come fly with me?!
14,00:01:04,00:01:06,"Come on! Let's go, people!"
15,00:01:06,00:01:08,Let's go! Come on in the back there!
16,00:01:10,00:01:12,"Ciao, David."
17,00:01:12,00:01:13,Oh... (chuckles)
18,00:01:13,00:01:15,I wish you were here.
19,00:01:15,00:01:20,"HODGES: Ciao bella, Elisabetta, il mia amore. I wish I were there, too."
20,00:01:20,00:01:22,You do? You're not avoiding me?
21,00:01:22,00:01:24,Of course not. Work beckons.
22,00:01:24,00:01:26,(chuckles) It's so beautiful here.
23,00:01:26,00:01:28,So empowering.
24,00:01:28,00:01:29,Empowering?
25,00:01:29,00:01:32,Sounds like you've been sipping the Alan Quinn Kool-Aid.
26,00:01:32,00:01:35,I'm about to enter the sacred mud spring.
27,00:01:35,00:01:38,"Ugh, if I can't see the bottom, I don't go in."
28,00:01:38,00:01:40,"If you were with me, you'd see something else."
29,00:01:40,00:01:43,It's all natural here.
30,00:01:43,00:01:46,I assume that this is a private mud spring?
31,00:01:46,00:01:50,Just me and nature.
32,00:01:50,00:01:51,"Ciao, David."
33,00:02:06,00:02:08,Ciao... (speaks Italian)
34,00:02:08,00:02:10,Is that your fiancé on the phone?
35,00:02:10,00:02:12,"You're such a tease, huh?"
36,00:02:12,00:02:14,Have you told him about me?
37,00:02:14,00:02:16,It's not the right time.
38,00:02:22,00:02:26,Santo? Non é buffo.
39,00:02:26,00:02:28,Not funny!
40,00:02:28,00:02:29,"(yells, laughs)"
41,00:02:29,00:02:32,Mi hai fatto paura! You scare me!
42,00:02:32,00:02:34,(speaks Italian)
43,00:02:35,00:02:36,Stop kicking!
44,00:02:36,00:02:37,I'm not kicking you!
45,00:02:37,00:02:39,"You, stop rubbing me."
46,00:02:39,00:02:39,I'm not.
47,00:02:47,00:02:49,(screaming)
48,00:02:55,00:02:58,Welcome to your hot springs nightmare.
49,00:02:58,00:03:01,Floater in a natural mud bath.
50,00:03:01,00:03:04,Why does this place look so familiar?
51,00:03:04,00:03:07,Because Alan Quinn shoots his infomercials here.
52,00:03:07,00:03:08,This is his resort.
53,00:03:08,00:03:09,Right.
54,00:03:09,00:03:11,"The ""Force of Mind"" guy."
55,00:03:11,00:03:13,All over late-night TV.
56,00:03:13,00:03:16,I don't think this'll make his next ad.
57,00:03:16,00:03:18,Watch your step.
58,00:03:22,00:03:25,What do we got?
59,00:03:25,00:03:27,It's a unknown male. There's no I.D.
60,00:03:27,00:03:30,Liver temp's ambient with the mud.
61,00:03:30,00:03:33,"Body's bloated, but there's no sloughing of the skin."
62,00:03:33,00:03:38,"I'd say he's been dead at least 24 hours, but probably no more than 36."
63,00:03:38,00:03:40,Heard a couple of bathers found him.
64,00:03:40,00:03:43,It floated up between them while they were messing around.
65,00:03:43,00:03:44,Yeah.
66,00:03:44,00:03:45,And we know one of the bathers.
67,00:03:45,00:03:47,RUSSELL: That's Elisabetta.
68,00:03:47,00:03:49,Hodges' girlfriend?
69,00:03:49,00:03:52,Yep. She was taking a dip with Fabio over there.
70,00:03:52,00:03:54,They're sharing a room.
71,00:03:54,00:03:56,"She and Hodges are still engaged, right?"
72,00:03:56,00:03:58,Far as I know.
73,00:03:58,00:04:00,"Hey, what is that right there?"
74,00:04:00,00:04:03,Looks like bruising.
75,00:04:03,00:04:04,Maybe handprints?
76,00:04:04,00:04:06,Could be he was held down.
77,00:04:07,00:04:10,"So, not an accidental drowning."
78,00:04:12,00:04:14,Murder in paradise.
79,00:04:50,00:04:52,You conquer fire...
80,00:04:55,00:04:57,...you can conquer anything.
81,00:04:58,00:05:00,It is all within you.
82,00:05:00,00:05:04,Here you go. Force of mind.
83,00:05:04,00:05:05,You got it-- yeah!
84,00:05:05,00:05:07,(laughs) There you go.
85,00:05:07,00:05:09,"Feels good to be an eagle, doesn't it?"
86,00:05:09,00:05:11,Doesn't it? Alan Quinn?
87,00:05:11,00:05:14,"Captain Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police."
88,00:05:14,00:05:17,"Excuse me, birdman, do me a favor-- fly back to your room."
89,00:05:17,00:05:20,I need to speak to your spirit guide.
90,00:05:20,00:05:26,"Hey, what's going on, Alan? Aren't you concerned that a murder victim was found in your mud springs?"
91,00:05:26,00:05:28,Of course I'm concerned.
92,00:05:28,00:05:29,It's a tragedy.
93,00:05:29,00:05:33,"Mr. Quinn, we're kind of hoping you could help us identify the victim."
94,00:05:33,00:05:36,"As far as I know, every employee, every guest has been accounted for."
95,00:05:36,00:05:38,And I handed over our registry to one of your guys.
96,00:05:38,00:05:39,"Well, somebody got stuck in the mud."
97,00:05:39,00:05:43,"All I can think is, uh, probably a hiker."
98,00:05:43,00:05:44,Sadly some people can't afford the entrance fee.
99,00:05:44,00:05:48,"So what do you think, they sneak down from the hillside?"
100,00:05:48,00:05:49,"If they're not a bother, I look the other way."
101,00:05:49,00:05:52,"In the end, these springs are for everyone, right?"
102,00:05:52,00:05:55,"That's a beautiful sentiment, Alan."
103,00:05:55,00:05:56,But let me tell you what's happening.
104,00:05:56,00:06:02,"Right now, these springs and every inch of this ground belongs to us."
105,00:06:02,00:06:04,You got it?
106,00:06:08,00:06:11,"BRODY: You know, I kind of miss playing in the mud."
107,00:06:11,00:06:15,Sacred bubbly mud. Even better.
108,00:06:15,00:06:18,Heard you might need some extra on-site testing.
109,00:06:18,00:06:20,I'm here to help.
110,00:06:20,00:06:23,She's over by the reception area.
111,00:06:27,00:06:30,"Elisabetta, Elisabetta, mi amore."
112,00:06:30,00:06:32,"It was horrible, David."
113,00:06:32,00:06:34,"Oh, it's okay, it's okay. I'm here."
114,00:06:34,00:06:37,"Now, I heard you were with someone?"
115,00:06:37,00:06:40,Si. Santo.
116,00:06:41,00:06:43,"He's my brother, David."
117,00:06:43,00:06:45,He's visiting from Tuscany.
118,00:06:45,00:06:48,"But I checked the hotel register, and he has a different last name."
119,00:06:48,00:06:50,And you two were staying in the same room.
120,00:06:50,00:06:52,"You don't trust me, David?"
121,00:06:52,00:06:57,"I do, it's just I want to, but I don't understand."
122,00:06:57,00:07:02,Santo and I have different last name because...
123,00:07:02,00:07:04,I was married before.
124,00:07:04,00:07:06,I keep my husband last name.
125,00:07:06,00:07:09,"David, I was very young."
126,00:07:09,00:07:10,Why didn't you tell me you were married before?
127,00:07:10,00:07:11,I tried.
128,00:07:11,00:07:13,You've been so busy.
129,00:07:13,00:07:14,You never have time for me.
130,00:07:14,00:07:19,"How much time does it take for someone to just say, ""By the way, I'm divorced, Italian-style""?"
131,00:07:19,00:07:21,It was just one week.
132,00:07:21,00:07:22,Not helping.
133,00:07:22,00:07:23,I'll explain everything.
134,00:07:23,00:07:24,Era niente.
135,00:07:24,00:07:25,It was nothing.
136,00:07:25,00:07:28,Please.
137,00:07:37,00:07:39,Ready?
138,00:07:39,00:07:40,Let's get dirty.
139,00:08:07,00:08:10,This looks like the last of it.
140,00:08:13,00:08:16,Hold on-- there's something's wedged between the rocks right here.
141,00:08:23,00:08:24,Leather bracelet?
142,00:08:24,00:08:28,It looks clean. That means it wasn't in here for very long.
143,00:08:28,00:08:32,Maybe it belonged to someone who was in here with our vic.
144,00:08:32,00:08:35,Maybe even our killer.
145,00:08:38,00:08:42,"SIDLE: Doc, what do we have?"
146,00:08:42,00:08:44,Confirmation our victim drowned.
147,00:08:44,00:08:47,Stomach contents are muddy.
148,00:08:47,00:08:50,Also confirmation we're dealing with a homicide.
149,00:08:50,00:08:55,"In addition to the apparent bruising to our victim's chest, I also found this abrasion on his forehead."
150,00:08:55,00:08:58,Think he was hit before he went in?
151,00:08:58,00:09:00,Possibly.
152,00:09:00,00:09:02,These were embedded inside the wound track.
153,00:09:02,00:09:05,Looks like wooden splinters.
154,00:09:05,00:09:06,Maybe from a weapon.
155,00:09:12,00:09:13,Beaten and then drowned?
156,00:09:13,00:09:16,I'll send this off to Hodges.
157,00:09:16,00:09:20,John Doe had a maxillary partial denture.
158,00:09:20,00:09:23,Four numbers are engraved on the metal framework.
159,00:09:23,00:09:27,Most dentists I.D. their patients using the last four digits of their Social.
160,00:09:27,00:09:30,Should give us a name.
161,00:09:35,00:09:37,SIDLE: Mrs. Wade.
162,00:09:37,00:09:39,Hi.
163,00:09:39,00:09:42,"I'm, um, I'm sorry for your loss."
164,00:09:42,00:09:44,I thought Justin was still at the spa.
165,00:09:44,00:09:46,I can't believe this.
166,00:09:46,00:09:48,You weren't with him at the spa?
167,00:09:48,00:09:51,"No, he was on a corporate retreat with his sales team."
168,00:09:51,00:09:54,Justin's a... a rep at Bixton.
169,00:09:54,00:09:56,Bixton-- the pharmaceutical company?
170,00:09:56,00:09:58,That's right.
171,00:09:58,00:10:02,The company uses Alan Quinn's team-building techniques.
172,00:10:02,00:10:08,"Do you know, um, if Justin had problems with any of his co-workers?"
173,00:10:08,00:10:10,No. He loved his job...
174,00:10:10,00:10:12,our life together...
175,00:10:12,00:10:16,We were just getting started.
176,00:10:16,00:10:17,When was the last time that you spoke with him?
177,00:10:17,00:10:21,Uh...
178,00:10:21,00:10:22,two days ago.
179,00:10:22,00:10:23,This is so stupid.
180,00:10:23,00:10:25,He didn't even want to go.
181,00:10:26,00:10:28,I convinced him.
182,00:10:28,00:10:31,Why didn't he want to go?
183,00:10:31,00:10:33,He thought it was New Agey and-and silly.
184,00:10:33,00:10:39,"I had stayed at the spa before, so I thought it would be good for him."
185,00:10:43,00:10:46,"RUSSELL: Wow, look at that. What wasn't in this mud bath?"
186,00:10:46,00:10:49,"FINLAY: Yeah, it looks like the day after a frat party."
187,00:10:49,00:10:52,STOKES: Complete with the muddy walk-of-shame evidence.
188,00:10:52,00:10:54,The condoms are swabbed for DNA.
189,00:10:54,00:10:55,Henry got no results.
190,00:10:55,00:10:57,As well as the bottles and cigarette butts.
191,00:10:57,00:10:59,And that pigeon feather is disgusting.
192,00:10:59,00:11:04,"Really, all of this stuff looks like it's been down there a couple of weeks except for this thing right here."
193,00:11:04,00:11:06,Doesn't even have any mud on it.
194,00:11:08,00:11:09,Can I see that thing?
195,00:11:09,00:11:11,Mm-hmm.
196,00:11:16,00:11:17,What are you doing?
197,00:11:17,00:11:18,This is a...
198,00:11:18,00:11:20,"eagle feather, maybe?"
199,00:11:20,00:11:27,"You know, you put this little tassel thing on the end of the feather, you got yourself a smudge feather."
200,00:11:27,00:11:30,(chuckles): A what? Smudge feather.
201,00:11:30,00:11:35,Native American Indians use it sometimes to waft incense around.
202,00:11:35,00:11:40,My mom used to use a smudge feather to cleanse the negativity from our house.
203,00:11:40,00:11:44,"I thought you said your house was a van? Believe me, that van needed a lot of smudging. Wait a sec."
204,00:11:44,00:11:45,Smudge feather.
205,00:11:45,00:11:46,Where have I seen that?
206,00:11:46,00:11:50,Alan Quinn sent over a list of everyone on the retreat.
207,00:11:50,00:11:52,Opening day itinerary.
208,00:11:52,00:11:56,He divided everyone into teams of three.
209,00:11:56,00:11:59,Each team was named after a type of eagle.
210,00:11:59,00:12:02,"So, this is a white-tailed eagle."
211,00:12:02,00:12:10,"And the feather symbol that Alan Quinn gave to you and your Bixton team-- which consisted of you, Heather, and Jessica Lowell and Justin Weed."
212,00:12:10,00:12:18,"First, let me say, as a citizen and as a representative of Bixton, I want to cooperate fully in this investigation."
213,00:12:18,00:12:20,I very much appreciate that.
214,00:12:20,00:12:24,"So, Justin's feather was found in his room."
215,00:12:24,00:12:28,And this feather was found where he died.
216,00:12:28,00:12:30,"So, whose feather is it?"
217,00:12:30,00:12:32,Is it your feather or is it Jessica's feather?
218,00:12:33,00:12:36,"(quiet, indistinct conversation)"
219,00:12:36,00:12:40,You and Jessica need some time to get your story straight?
220,00:12:40,00:12:43,I have nothing to hide.
221,00:12:43,00:12:44,We were both with Justin.
222,00:12:44,00:12:47,Heather wanted a team strategy meeting.
223,00:12:47,00:12:49,Having it at Club Mud was my idea.
224,00:12:49,00:12:53,What time did you meet at the mud bath? Around 10:00.
225,00:12:53,00:12:54,And what was the mood in the mud?
226,00:12:54,00:12:56,Was everything cool with Justin?
227,00:12:56,00:13:00,Justin was over the whole Alan Quinn team-building- eagle-flying-thing.
228,00:13:00,00:13:02,He just wanted to go home. Sure.
229,00:13:02,00:13:04,And what about you and Heather?
230,00:13:04,00:13:05,Who doesn't like a free mud bath?
231,00:13:05,00:13:11,"Heather, on the other hand, spent that last day looking like she was gonna pop a button on her pant suit."
232,00:13:11,00:13:12,Why's that?
233,00:13:12,00:13:14,She wasn't happy with the team.
234,00:13:14,00:13:20,"HEATHER: I don't want to speak ill of the deceased, but Justin let the team down."
235,00:13:20,00:13:21,How so?
236,00:13:21,00:13:23,He wouldn't do the firewalk.
237,00:13:23,00:13:25,And why would that concern your team?
238,00:13:25,00:13:28,Alan Quinn sends an assessment report back to Bixton.
239,00:13:28,00:13:32,"Your team fails mission objectives, you get a bad score."
240,00:13:32,00:13:34,So you were upset with Justin?
241,00:13:34,00:13:36,Maybe even got into a shoving match.
242,00:13:36,00:13:40,Not liking your insinuation here.
243,00:13:40,00:13:44,They were both alive and well when I left.
244,00:13:44,00:13:49,"So, you're saying that Jessica and Justin stayed in the mud bath together."
245,00:13:49,00:13:50,Don't know what happened after that.
246,00:13:50,00:13:51,JESSICA: We just...
247,00:13:51,00:13:52,talked.
248,00:13:52,00:13:54,He was distracted.
249,00:13:54,00:13:57,I was half-naked and he didn't even blink.
250,00:13:57,00:13:59,All he could talk about was his wife.
251,00:13:59,00:14:02,Why are the good ones always so boring?
252,00:14:02,00:14:04,"So, how'd the night end?"
253,00:14:04,00:14:07,We got out at the same time. Now wait a minute...
254,00:14:07,00:14:10,(sighs) Justin got out of the mud bath? Yeah.
255,00:14:10,00:14:11,We walked back together.
256,00:14:11,00:14:13,I saw him go into his room.
257,00:14:13,00:14:15,What time was that? Around 11:00.
258,00:14:15,00:14:18,Okay.
259,00:14:18,00:14:19,"Thank you, Jessica."
260,00:14:19,00:14:22,You can call me Jess.
261,00:14:22,00:14:24,Any time.
262,00:14:26,00:14:28,You text me?
263,00:14:28,00:14:30,"Indeed, I did."
264,00:14:30,00:14:34,I understand our women in the mud bath claim that Justin Wade exited the mud?
265,00:14:34,00:14:37,"Yeah, yeah, before he returned to it to drown."
266,00:14:37,00:14:41,I sense your frustration and I may have something to assuage it.
267,00:14:43,00:14:45,"The bruising on the victim's chest, right? Mm-hmm."
268,00:14:45,00:14:50,Histology results of the tissue reveal fluid loss from damaged blood vessels.
269,00:14:50,00:14:53,Swelling and blistering that was obfuscated from the bloating.
270,00:14:53,00:14:58,Blistering. So you're saying that he was burned before he was drowned?
271,00:14:58,00:15:06,"According to Doc Robbins, an inhaled substance caused urticaria and angioedema along the interior of the primary bronchi."
272,00:15:06,00:15:08,I think the cause-- smoke.
273,00:15:08,00:15:10,Okay.
274,00:15:10,00:15:13,"And, you recall that Justin Wade had splinters in his forehead?"
275,00:15:13,00:15:15,"Yeah, he was hit by some kind of weapon, right?"
276,00:15:15,00:15:17,I think not.
277,00:15:17,00:15:20,The splinters are wood from the Northwestern Red Cedar.
278,00:15:20,00:15:25,It's a tree that's sacred to Native Americans used in rituals and rites of passage.
279,00:15:25,00:15:28,Like Alan Quinn's firewalks.
280,00:15:28,00:15:30,"Wood in his head, smoke in his lungs."
281,00:15:30,00:15:34,"I think between dips in the mud, Justin Wade played with fire."
282,00:15:34,00:15:37,"And, I can prove it."
283,00:15:37,00:15:39,If... you'll firewalk this way.
284,00:15:45,00:15:50,"First of all, walking across hot coals doesn't take force of mind, it takes force of physics."
285,00:15:50,00:15:55,Coal's lightweight carbon structure is a poor conductor of heat.
286,00:15:55,00:15:58,The layer of ash further insulates the heat.
287,00:15:58,00:16:04,"Firewalks are conducted at night so you see the red, burning coals, and not the layer of ash that coats them."
288,00:16:04,00:16:05,"Phew, whoa!"
289,00:16:05,00:16:06,You sure about this?
290,00:16:06,00:16:08,That's hot enough to cook meat.
291,00:16:08,00:16:10,But your feet only make contact for two-tenths of a second.
292,00:16:10,00:16:15,The key is to walk softly and steadily.
293,00:16:20,00:16:23,"Ecco, amico mio."
294,00:16:23,00:16:25,I am an eagle!
295,00:16:25,00:16:26,"All right, what about the victim?"
296,00:16:26,00:16:28,He didn't receive his wings.
297,00:16:28,00:16:35,"While we know that Justin Wade was a reluctant spiritual warrior, Heather, his teammate, was unhappy with his unwillingness to walk the fire."
298,00:16:35,00:16:44,"So you think that after Heather berated him in the mud bath, he went back to his room, and he warriored up, and he gave it a shot."
299,00:16:44,00:16:46,Bad shot.
300,00:16:46,00:16:51,"I think he panicked halfway across, tripped and fell."
301,00:16:51,00:16:53,Forehead hitting an unburned piece of cedar.
302,00:16:53,00:16:56,Discoloration on the chest that we thought was bruising...
303,00:16:56,00:16:58,was really burns.
304,00:16:58,00:17:02,"You know, the firewalk was fenced off from the rest of the spa."
305,00:17:02,00:17:06,"Even if Justin Wade warriored up, there's only one person who conducts the firewalk."
306,00:17:06,00:17:11,Alan Quinn. Bad for business if a client ends up with third-degree burns and in the hospital.
307,00:17:11,00:17:15,Better if he ends up accidentally drowned in the mud bath.
308,00:17:15,00:17:18,Letting the healing waters cover up all the sins.
309,00:17:28,00:17:32,Justin Wade... the floater in your mud.
310,00:17:32,00:17:35,"He wasn't a hiker, he was your client."
311,00:17:35,00:17:39,We have evidence that ties Justin to the kind of cedar wood that you use in your firewalk.
312,00:17:39,00:17:42,BRASS: He wanted to make a firewalk to help his team.
313,00:17:42,00:17:44,"He needed your guidance, maybe?"
314,00:17:44,00:17:47,"BRASS: Didn't turn out so good, huh?"
315,00:17:47,00:17:48,"Come on, Alan."
316,00:17:48,00:17:50,You lied to us.
317,00:17:50,00:17:52,You were with Justin that night.
318,00:17:52,00:17:54,Force of mind.
319,00:17:54,00:17:56,Be brave.
320,00:17:56,00:17:58,Tell us what happened.
321,00:17:58,00:18:02,I had no idea it was Justin.
322,00:18:02,00:18:05,"Uh, he called me to his room, wanted to do a firewalk."
323,00:18:05,00:18:06,"So, you took him up there? No."
324,00:18:06,00:18:09,"Uh, I sensed he wasn't ready."
325,00:18:09,00:18:13,"You know, I'd rather have someone not do the walk than try and fail."
326,00:18:13,00:18:15,Told him to go to bed.
327,00:18:15,00:18:16,What time was this?
328,00:18:16,00:18:17,Around 11:30.
329,00:18:17,00:18:19,Went home after that.
330,00:18:19,00:18:21,"Back to your room. No, home."
331,00:18:21,00:18:22,Santa Barbara.
332,00:18:22,00:18:24,"Flew back Friday, midnight."
333,00:18:24,00:18:25,You fly like an eagle?
334,00:18:25,00:18:26,Or fly commercial?
335,00:18:26,00:18:29,Private jet.
336,00:18:29,00:18:30,"Call my co-pilot, he'll confirm it."
337,00:18:34,00:18:35,"Hey, Doc. Hey."
338,00:18:35,00:18:40,What do we got? I am looking at a sample from Justin Wade's bronchial tissue.
339,00:18:40,00:18:43,I don't think the smoke from the firewalk caused this inflammation.
340,00:18:43,00:18:45,Take a look.
341,00:18:47,00:18:54,"ROBBINS: He had an acute mast cell degranulation resulting in a massive release of histamines, tryptases and chymases."
342,00:18:54,00:18:57,The guy suffered anaphylactic shock.
343,00:18:57,00:18:59,Caused by what?
344,00:18:59,00:19:02,"Unknown. I only see effect, not cause."
345,00:19:02,00:19:07,That's weird. We thought that Justin Wade fell in the fire because he had an anxiety attack.
346,00:19:07,00:19:10,"No, what he really had was an allergy attack."
347,00:19:10,00:19:16,"Okay, well, I'll send this tissue up to Hodges, have him run a Rast test and find out what caused it."
348,00:19:47,00:19:48,"Ciao, Morgan. Hi."
349,00:19:48,00:19:50,Thanks for meeting me.
350,00:19:50,00:19:53,Yeah. I was actually surprised you wanted to meet up with me.
351,00:19:53,00:19:55,I don't have so many amici here.
352,00:19:55,00:19:58,"Friends. So, I was thinking maybe we could talk."
353,00:19:58,00:20:02,David's speaking about you so much.
354,00:20:02,00:20:05,I think you two guys... are very close.
355,00:20:05,00:20:07,We're very good friends.
356,00:20:07,00:20:11,Friends? To a certain degree.
357,00:20:11,00:20:13,What are we talking?
358,00:20:13,00:20:17,I just feel that there is a weird distance between us.
359,00:20:17,00:20:19,I feel there is something wrong.
360,00:20:19,00:20:24,"Or, maybe... someone else. (chuckles): Trust me, honey, there is absolutely nobody else."
361,00:20:24,00:20:27,"When I look at the two of you, you are so great together."
362,00:20:27,00:20:30,And-and he is smitten with you.
363,00:20:30,00:20:32,But why he seem so unhappy lately?
364,00:20:32,00:20:34,He doesn't speak about marriage anymore.
365,00:20:34,00:20:36,I think...
366,00:20:36,00:20:39,you need to talk to David.
367,00:20:39,00:20:41,You need to have this conversation...
368,00:20:41,00:20:44,with him.
369,00:20:48,00:20:50,I'm not gonna ask.
370,00:20:50,00:20:52,"Really? How disappointing. Mm, I'm not doing it."
371,00:20:52,00:20:54,I wore it for you.
372,00:20:54,00:20:55,Fine. What?
373,00:20:55,00:21:06,"Common household items: swim cap, hot water bottle, balloons, cleaning gloves, bath mat, shower curtain-- they're all made of latex."
374,00:21:06,00:21:13,"And, uh, thanks to my assiduous testing, I've determined are the cause of our victim's allergic reaction."
375,00:21:13,00:21:15,He had a reaction to latex?
376,00:21:15,00:21:19,"Aren't you missing the obvious, the condom that we found in the mud bath...?"
377,00:21:19,00:21:23,We're not talking about the pedestrian skin contact here.
378,00:21:23,00:21:26,Justin Wade's bronchial constriction says he inhaled the latex.
379,00:21:26,00:21:28,SIDLE: How's that happen?
380,00:21:28,00:21:31,"HODGES: Well, you know what they say: where there's latex vapor there's fire."
381,00:21:31,00:21:33,(Justin gasping)
382,00:21:38,00:21:41,So you're saying there was latex in the burning coals of the firewalk.
383,00:21:41,00:21:43,"Greg's at the primary now, looking for the culprit."
384,00:21:43,00:21:45,Interesting theory.
385,00:21:45,00:21:48,"You know, latex allergy's kind of a personal thing."
386,00:21:48,00:21:50,"Yeah, something only a spouse might know of."
387,00:21:52,00:21:57,"Justin Wade's wife, Mary, told me that she'd been to Alan Quinn's spa before."
388,00:21:57,00:21:59,So she knows all about the firewalk.
389,00:21:59,00:22:04,"Man alone in the mud bath with two women, one of whom admits to hitting on him."
390,00:22:04,00:22:05,Workplace romance?
391,00:22:05,00:22:07,I wouldn't know anything about that.
392,00:22:07,00:22:09,Just sayin'.
393,00:22:09,00:22:11,Could be a cause for murder.
394,00:22:11,00:22:16,"I'm assuming you're aware your husband had a latex allergy, Mrs. Wade?"
395,00:22:16,00:22:17,"Yes, why?"
396,00:22:17,00:22:21,We discovered that he had an extreme allergic reaction before he died.
397,00:22:21,00:22:23,But he was always so careful.
398,00:22:23,00:22:25,You said it was all good between you two?
399,00:22:25,00:22:27,That's right.
400,00:22:27,00:22:29,"Well, not according to his phone records."
401,00:22:29,00:22:33,"About three weeks ago, Jessica Lowell started calling Justin."
402,00:22:33,00:22:35,"A lot. Work calls, I'd imagine."
403,00:22:35,00:22:39,"Most of the calls here are after work, after midnight, in fact."
404,00:22:39,00:22:41,What does this have to do...
405,00:22:41,00:22:42,with Justin's death?
406,00:22:42,00:22:44,"Mary, you told me that you were home the night that Justin died."
407,00:22:44,00:22:46,"But that isn't true, is it?"
408,00:22:46,00:22:50,"You got a speeding ticket ten miles from the spa at, uh, let's see..."
409,00:22:50,00:22:53,8:30 p.m.
410,00:22:53,00:22:55,"Okay, I..."
411,00:22:55,00:22:57,realize how this must look.
412,00:22:57,00:22:58,Looks bad.
413,00:22:58,00:23:00,"Okay, yes."
414,00:23:00,00:23:03,I was on my way to the spa.
415,00:23:04,00:23:07,I had a feeling about Jessica Lowell.
416,00:23:07,00:23:09,So you went to confront them. Yes.
417,00:23:09,00:23:11,But I didn't.
418,00:23:11,00:23:12,"Okay, I filled up my car, and I..."
419,00:23:12,00:23:14,"and I turned around, and I went home."
420,00:23:14,00:23:16,"Look, I told you..."
421,00:23:16,00:23:19,I loved my husband.
422,00:23:19,00:23:21,And in the end...
423,00:23:21,00:23:23,that meant trusting him.
424,00:23:25,00:23:27,Just got back from Alan Quinn's fire walk.
425,00:23:27,00:23:29,"Knee-deep in coal ash, found these."
426,00:23:29,00:23:30,Drug implant pellets.
427,00:23:30,00:23:32,Used for maintaining hormone levels.
428,00:23:32,00:23:35,(laughs)
429,00:23:35,00:23:36,What are they made of?
430,00:23:36,00:23:38,Latex.
431,00:23:39,00:23:41,Looks to me like one of them isn't fully burned.
432,00:23:41,00:23:43,Logo says...
433,00:23:43,00:23:48,"""Made by Bixton."" The same company Justin Wade worked for."
434,00:23:48,00:23:50,That can't be a coincidence.
435,00:23:50,00:23:52,Nope.
436,00:23:52,00:23:53,"Here, maybe I can get a partial."
437,00:24:16,00:24:20,RUSSELL: Jessica Lowell is not returning Brass's phone calls.
438,00:24:20,00:24:21,She's also a no-show at work.
439,00:24:21,00:24:23,Sounds like she's on the run.
440,00:24:23,00:24:25,Bixton sent over her employee file.
441,00:24:25,00:24:29,"Three years ago, she was suspended from work for six months."
442,00:24:29,00:24:33,She and two other employees were under suspicion of selling company secrets.
443,00:24:35,00:24:36,But she wasn't fired. No.
444,00:24:36,00:24:37,They didn't have enough on her.
445,00:24:37,00:24:38,"Okay, so what are we thinking?"
446,00:24:38,00:24:42,"That Jessica Lowell was up to her old tricks again, stealing from the company?"
447,00:24:42,00:24:45,"Justin Wade finds out, she kills him."
448,00:24:45,00:24:53,"If that's the case, there's still one more member of ""Team White-Tailed Eagle."" Heather Conner. Right, and if she found out what Justin Wade found out, we need to find her now."
449,00:24:53,00:24:54,Thank you.
450,00:24:57,00:24:59,"All right, Heather, thank you very much for coming in."
451,00:24:59,00:25:01,I don't know what happened to Justin.
452,00:25:01,00:25:03,I swear.
453,00:25:03,00:25:05,Can I please have some water?
454,00:25:05,00:25:07,It's right there in front of you.
455,00:25:07,00:25:11,"Sorry, of course. Heather, you need to relax, okay?"
456,00:25:11,00:25:13,You are not a suspect.
457,00:25:13,00:25:16,What we need right now is to find Jessica.
458,00:25:21,00:25:25,Jessica's not who she says she is.
459,00:25:25,00:25:27,Who is she?
460,00:25:27,00:25:29,A thief.
461,00:25:30,00:25:33,She steals company secrets.
462,00:25:33,00:25:36,And Justin found out.
463,00:25:36,00:25:37,Is that why he's dead? Yes.
464,00:25:37,00:25:44,I think Jessica kills anyone who gets in her way.
465,00:25:46,00:25:47,"Oh, this water's terrible."
466,00:25:47,00:25:52,The Jessica Lowells are destroying Bixton.
467,00:25:52,00:25:53,Consider a new typical drug.
468,00:25:53,00:26:00,"After an average development cost of 900 million, a successful launch depends on sales reps delivering complex information."
469,00:26:00,00:26:05,I put every fiber of my soul into this company.
470,00:26:05,00:26:07,"Into America! Heather, slow down."
471,00:26:07,00:26:09,It's okay. I try...
472,00:26:09,00:26:10,to do the right thing.
473,00:26:10,00:26:15,(wheezing): I try... so hard to be good.
474,00:26:15,00:26:16,Are you okay?
475,00:26:16,00:26:19,"(wheezing) I need a medic! Oh, my God."
476,00:26:19,00:26:22,"...2-3, we need a medic in here. I need a medic now!"
477,00:26:27,00:26:28,"Finn... hey, listen to me, listen to me."
478,00:26:28,00:26:29,You did everything you could.
479,00:26:29,00:26:32,Now just-just get the body to Doc as soon as you can.
480,00:26:32,00:26:35,Whew! Finlay's at E.R.
481,00:26:35,00:26:38,"Conner girl didn't make it. I mean, it's crazy."
482,00:26:38,00:26:40,A seemingly healthy woman just drops during an interrogation?
483,00:26:40,00:26:45,Kind of like Justin taking a header in the middle of his firewalk.
484,00:26:45,00:26:49,"Doesn't make any sense. Well, the only common denominator is Jessica Lowell-- maybe she poisoned them both."
485,00:26:49,00:26:50,Do we know where she is yet?
486,00:26:50,00:26:52,Still in the wind.
487,00:26:52,00:26:59,"ROBBINS: Haven't had a chance to open up Heather Conner yet, to determine C.O.D.-- but, in the washroom, David found this."
488,00:26:59,00:27:02,White powder under her fingernails.
489,00:27:02,00:27:04,Hodges says it's magnesium sulfate.
490,00:27:04,00:27:06,Common dietary supplement.
491,00:27:06,00:27:08,"Yeah, David found a receipt in her purse."
492,00:27:08,00:27:11,She'd been stocking up on all sorts of nutrients and powders.
493,00:27:11,00:27:15,Maybe Jessica Lowell spiked her vitamin shake.
494,00:27:15,00:27:16,Could explain her death.
495,00:27:16,00:27:18,Now for the unexplainable.
496,00:27:19,00:27:21,David also found...
497,00:27:21,00:27:24,strands of animal hair.
498,00:27:24,00:27:27,Hodges I.D.'d it as capra aegagrus hircus.
499,00:27:27,00:27:29,Goat? Yeah.
500,00:27:29,00:27:31,She had goat hair all over her.
501,00:27:31,00:27:32,I didn't say it made sense.
502,00:27:32,00:27:34,"Mm, something better start making sense."
503,00:27:40,00:27:44,You here on business or to make another girl date with my fiancée?
504,00:27:44,00:27:45,She told you we met.
505,00:27:45,00:27:49,"No, uh, she texted me by mistake."
506,00:27:49,00:27:52,"""Morgan, thank you for listening."
507,00:27:52,00:27:56,"My new amica."" She just wanted to talk."
508,00:27:56,00:27:59,"Look, I'm on your side, Hodges."
509,00:27:59,00:28:00,She's a great girl.
510,00:28:00,00:28:02,Who feels that I'm backing away.
511,00:28:02,00:28:04,Are you?
512,00:28:07,00:28:10,"Ah, saved by the tox report."
513,00:28:12,00:28:13,Whoa.
514,00:28:13,00:28:17,Heather Conner was higher than Elvis at the Vegas Hilton.
515,00:28:17,00:28:19,So she wasn't poisoned.
516,00:28:19,00:28:20,She O.D.'d.
517,00:28:20,00:28:22,Makes sense.
518,00:28:22,00:28:24,"You said you found magnesium sulfate underneath her fingernails, right?"
519,00:28:24,00:28:27,"Yeah, I thought that was from a vitamin drink."
520,00:28:27,00:28:29,But it's also used to manufacture meth.
521,00:28:29,00:28:33,"Drug sales rep becomes drug cook, becomes drug addict."
522,00:28:33,00:28:35,Deadly career path.
523,00:28:35,00:28:37,"So, she's tweaking on meth, she's called in by PD."
524,00:28:37,00:28:40,She's worried that we figured it all out-- the illegal drugs.
525,00:28:40,00:28:42,She takes some downers to calm down.
526,00:28:42,00:28:45,"And she downs herself forever, right in front of us."
527,00:28:45,00:28:48,I hear you get very thirsty on meth.
528,00:28:48,00:28:50,Check out the stomach contents.
529,00:28:50,00:28:55,"""Lacteal secretions high in potassium, niacin and copper."" Milk."
530,00:28:55,00:28:56,Goat milk.
531,00:28:56,00:28:58,The udder milk.
532,00:28:59,00:29:00,"Come on, it's too easy."
533,00:29:00,00:29:02,"No, it's too much goat."
534,00:29:02,00:29:04,We found goat hair on Heather's clothes.
535,00:29:05,00:29:07,(cell phone dings)
536,00:29:07,00:29:10,Text from Nick.
537,00:29:10,00:29:14,"Our prime suspect, Jessica Lowell, just turned herself in."
538,00:29:14,00:29:16,STOKES: Thought you were on the run.
539,00:29:16,00:29:17,Business trip.
540,00:29:17,00:29:19,I came back as soon as possible.
541,00:29:19,00:29:20,I want to cooperate.
542,00:29:20,00:29:21,"Well, that's good."
543,00:29:21,00:29:24,You knew the murder victim Justin Wade.
544,00:29:24,00:29:25,The guy who was drowned in a mud bath?
545,00:29:25,00:29:30,STOKES: We found your prints on the latex pellets that were tossed into the firewalk to knock Justin out.
546,00:29:30,00:29:32,Those pellets were samples.
547,00:29:32,00:29:35,We all had them at the retreat.
548,00:29:35,00:29:39,"Captain Brass, I believe you know Colin Garrett with the FBI field office here."
549,00:29:39,00:29:42,Mm-hmm. We're working together.
550,00:29:42,00:29:43,I'm not a sales rep.
551,00:29:43,00:29:45,I handle corporate security at Bixton.
552,00:29:45,00:29:47,I'm teamed up with the FBI right now.
553,00:29:47,00:29:53,Justin Wade and Heather Conner were under investigation for stealing research and drugs to manufacture designer meth.
554,00:29:53,00:29:56,Just slip your mind to mention that to me before?
555,00:29:56,00:30:00,"And the last time I checked, big pharmaceuticals don't sell street meth. No."
556,00:30:00,00:30:04,"But we have all the chemicals at hand, and cutting-edge lab technology."
557,00:30:04,00:30:06,We believe they set up a lab somewhere.
558,00:30:06,00:30:08,"BRASS: Well, that still doesn't explain how Justin ended up dead."
559,00:30:08,00:30:11,Are you familiar with Rolan Zahl?
560,00:30:11,00:30:13,Drug distributor-- bad news.
561,00:30:13,00:30:15,JESSICA: Worse news for Justin.
562,00:30:15,00:30:16,Zahl was his street connect.
563,00:30:16,00:30:21,"Feds think that once he finished with the lab, he became expendable."
564,00:30:21,00:30:24,So you're saying that Justin Wade's murder was a drug hit?
565,00:30:24,00:30:27,You have a better theory?
566,00:30:27,00:30:29,Did you follow up on the Rolan Zahl drug angle?
567,00:30:29,00:30:33,"Yup, I tested some meth pulled off a Mad-10 dealer two days ago."
568,00:30:33,00:30:35,Same trace contaminants we found in Heather Conner?
569,00:30:35,00:30:37,To a tee.
570,00:30:37,00:30:44,"Okay, well, I did a little follow-up of my own on the magnesium sulfate from, uh, Heather's fingernails. Uh-huh."
571,00:30:44,00:30:50,"According to her credit cards, she bought about 200 pounds of the stuff last month, from a medical supply company."
572,00:30:50,00:30:53,And it was shipped to Greenlore Scientific.
573,00:30:53,00:30:56,AKA our secret meth lab. That's right.
574,00:30:56,00:31:00,Looks like it's time to pay a visit to 93644 Dagwood Street.
575,00:31:02,00:31:04,(sirens wailing)
576,00:31:12,00:31:13,LVPD! Open up!
577,00:31:16,00:31:18,LVPD! Open up!
578,00:31:18,00:31:19,"Go, Stokes."
579,00:31:26,00:31:28,LVPD! Open up!
580,00:31:28,00:31:29,Go.
581,00:31:42,00:31:44,(bleating)
582,00:31:44,00:31:46,What the...?
583,00:31:47,00:31:50,"(glass breaks nearby, goat bleats)"
584,00:31:59,00:32:02,(door creaking)
585,00:32:15,00:32:18,Looks like they cleared out.
586,00:32:18,00:32:20,Think we found our lab.
587,00:32:20,00:32:21,"Yeah, what's left of it."
588,00:32:21,00:32:24,"Hold on, Nick."
589,00:32:24,00:32:25,Check this out.
590,00:32:28,00:32:29,"Well, somebody trashed the place."
591,00:32:35,00:32:39,This is too elaborate just to manufacture meth.
592,00:32:42,00:32:44,Industrial fridge.
593,00:32:44,00:32:46,Don't usually see that in a meth lab.
594,00:32:46,00:32:47,Nope.
595,00:32:51,00:32:53,Got milk?
596,00:32:53,00:32:56,"Right-- goat's milk, I'm guessing."
597,00:32:56,00:33:01,SIDLE: Distillation condenser-- this is some very complex chemistry.
598,00:33:01,00:33:03,STOKES: Microporous membranes?
599,00:33:03,00:33:10,You don't use that to make meth. I got to say a lot of the stuff in here just doesn't fit with making street drugs.
600,00:33:10,00:33:11,(distant thump)
601,00:33:33,00:33:34,Mrs. Wade?!
602,00:33:34,00:33:36,Please don't hurt me.
603,00:33:44,00:33:49,"SANDERS: Nick's still collecting evidence, but he sent over some trace from the farmhouse lab."
604,00:33:49,00:33:51,It's definitely meth.
605,00:33:51,00:33:52,"So, what do you think?"
606,00:33:52,00:33:54,Husband and wife cooking team?
607,00:33:54,00:33:56,Looks like it.
608,00:33:56,00:33:58,"""Looks like it""?"
609,00:33:58,00:34:00,The goat milk doesn't make sense.
610,00:34:00,00:34:04,"Well, maybe it's some kind of cutting agent for the meth."
611,00:34:04,00:34:05,"Ah, it's more than that."
612,00:34:05,00:34:06,There was...
613,00:34:06,00:34:11,a lot of sophisticated equipment in that lab; stuff you don't need to make meth.
614,00:34:17,00:34:20,Something else was cooking in that kitchen.
615,00:34:20,00:34:21,(coughs)
616,00:34:26,00:34:28,(door opens)
617,00:34:31,00:34:34,"I know you think Justin, Heather and I are all meth dealers."
618,00:34:36,00:34:37,"Yeah, I do."
619,00:34:37,00:34:40,And I know why: you need the money because you're sick.
620,00:34:42,00:34:47,I... have a chronic deficiency of the antithrombin.
621,00:34:47,00:34:48,It's an anti-coagulant.
622,00:34:48,00:34:50,"And without it, I'm..."
623,00:34:50,00:34:53,in constant danger of blood clots.
624,00:34:53,00:34:54,Which can cause a pulmonary embolism.
625,00:34:57,00:35:00,"So, Justin was using a Bixton drug formula to help you."
626,00:35:00,00:35:03,It uses goat milk to make the antithrombin protein.
627,00:35:03,00:35:07,It's why Justin took the job with Bixton in the first place.
628,00:35:07,00:35:08,To steal the recipe?
629,00:35:08,00:35:10,Yes.
630,00:35:10,00:35:17,"The drug's called ""Btryn."" It was canceled during clinical trials three years ago."
631,00:35:17,00:35:19,Company deemed it too expensive.
632,00:35:19,00:35:25,"My disease is extremely rare, so there wouldn't have been enough customers."
633,00:35:25,00:35:28,"Yeah, those pharmaceutical giants have their bills to pay."
634,00:35:28,00:35:32,"So, Justin started making the drug himself."
635,00:35:32,00:35:34,But he needed the money to do it.
636,00:35:34,00:35:37,That's where Heather came in.
637,00:35:37,00:35:41,It was her crazy idea to set up the lab.
638,00:35:41,00:35:43,Was the Btryn working?
639,00:35:43,00:35:45,I've been on it for about a month now.
640,00:35:45,00:35:46,Justin was right.
641,00:35:46,00:35:49,It's-it's actually helped stabilize me.
642,00:35:49,00:35:53,I never knew that he was making meth.
643,00:35:53,00:35:56,I only found out about it a couple days ago.
644,00:35:56,00:35:59,"You know, I don't get why you destroyed the lab."
645,00:35:59,00:36:01,"I mean, it was your one chance to get the medicine."
646,00:36:01,00:36:03,I... I didn't destroy it.
647,00:36:03,00:36:04,I went to get my last dose.
648,00:36:12,00:36:14,If Mary Wade's telling the truth...
649,00:36:14,00:36:19,and she isn't the one that trashed this place...
650,00:36:19,00:36:20,Then who did?
651,00:36:20,00:36:22,All this...
652,00:36:22,00:36:24,"destruction, this rage."
653,00:36:24,00:36:26,This is personal.
654,00:36:26,00:36:27,"Yeah, I think I got something here."
655,00:36:27,00:36:29,In the sink. Check it out.
656,00:36:32,00:36:37,"STOKES: Maybe in the middle of going Hulk, our suspect cut himself on some glass."
657,00:36:39,00:36:41,BRODY: Rinsed it off in the sink.
658,00:36:41,00:36:43,And left behind some blood.
659,00:37:03,00:37:05,Russell?
660,00:37:05,00:37:08,I got DNA on the blood from the meth lab sink.
661,00:37:08,00:37:11,You are not gonna believe who broke into the place.
662,00:37:11,00:37:14,"QUINN (inhaling, exhaling): Come on, Sheila."
663,00:37:14,00:37:15,Exhale the weakness.
664,00:37:15,00:37:16,Release the toxins.
665,00:37:16,00:37:18,(exhaling)
666,00:37:18,00:37:20,"Feels strong, right?"
667,00:37:20,00:37:23,Just have faith in me.
668,00:37:23,00:37:25,(inhaling): No fear.
669,00:37:25,00:37:29,"Mary Wade have faith in you, Alan?"
670,00:37:30,00:37:31,I'm sorry?
671,00:37:31,00:37:33,Can you give us a second?
672,00:37:33,00:37:38,I wanted to talk to Alan about the blood he left in the meth lab.
673,00:37:39,00:37:40,Because you did.
674,00:37:40,00:37:42,When you broke in.
675,00:37:42,00:37:45,Force of entry more than force of mind.
676,00:37:45,00:37:47,I have no idea what you're talking about.
677,00:37:47,00:37:50,Did you teach Mary your breathing exercises?
678,00:37:50,00:37:52,And... did you know she was sick?
679,00:37:52,00:37:55,I wouldn't-- Because we checked your credit cards.
680,00:37:55,00:38:02,"You've been shipping her cases of that Spirit Force drink of yours. You do that for all your clients, Alan?"
681,00:38:02,00:38:05,"I'm trying to help Mary. Well, of course you are."
682,00:38:05,00:38:07,"I mean, good heavens, you're in love with her, right?"
683,00:38:09,00:38:12,Mary's a very special... very brave woman.
684,00:38:12,00:38:14,"Yeah, she is. But you didn't answer my question."
685,00:38:17,00:38:18,"You know, I came from nothing."
686,00:38:18,00:38:21,Built an empire.
687,00:38:21,00:38:24,"Truth is, I never found anyone who interested me."
688,00:38:24,00:38:27,Until Mary.
689,00:38:27,00:38:32,"When you find your other half, that..."
690,00:38:32,00:38:35,is what it's really like to fly.
691,00:38:37,00:38:41,Have you found your other half?
692,00:38:41,00:38:43,Wow. That's so romantic.
693,00:38:43,00:38:45,"The truth is, she didn't want to fly with you, did she?"
694,00:38:45,00:38:47,"I mean, she didn't want to have anything to do with you, Alan."
695,00:38:47,00:38:49,And you know why?
696,00:38:49,00:38:50,Because her husband already found a cure for her.
697,00:38:50,00:38:53,Something that actually worked.
698,00:38:53,00:38:54,Is that what happened?
699,00:38:54,00:38:55,Hmm?
700,00:38:55,00:38:58,"You found out that his worked, yours didn't?"
701,00:38:58,00:39:01,Is that why you destroyed his lab?
702,00:39:01,00:39:02,"Well, come on, man."
703,00:39:02,00:39:05,Usually you have all the answers.
704,00:39:05,00:39:07,You know something?
705,00:39:07,00:39:09,I've seen people like you before.
706,00:39:09,00:39:11,And you make me sick.
707,00:39:11,00:39:15,You sell snake oil to the weak.
708,00:39:15,00:39:19,So you think Justin Wade was so good?
709,00:39:19,00:39:20,He was poisoning her.
710,00:39:20,00:39:22,I wasn't gonna watch her die.
711,00:39:22,00:39:23,(scoffs)
712,00:39:26,00:39:29,Modern medicine?
713,00:39:29,00:39:31,That's the real snake oil here.
714,00:39:31,00:39:39,"They spend millions conning people into buying chemicals and pills, so they can make billions."
715,00:39:39,00:39:41,(scoffs) The weak?
716,00:39:41,00:39:42,I...
717,00:39:42,00:39:46,I make people strong.
718,00:39:46,00:39:49,"Justin Wade, he didn't understand that."
719,00:39:49,00:39:51,And he didn't understand Mary.
720,00:39:51,00:39:52,I do.
721,00:39:52,00:39:54,"You killed him, didn't you?"
722,00:39:59,00:40:01,You're damn right I did.
723,00:40:03,00:40:05,Whatever it took to save Mary's life.
724,00:40:09,00:40:12,To heal her; to make her fly.
725,00:40:12,00:40:14,And I'd do it again.
726,00:40:18,00:40:20,Thank you.
727,00:40:20,00:40:21,(clears throat)
728,00:40:27,00:40:30,"ELISABETTA: David, everything is okay?"
729,00:40:30,00:40:33,Are you still upset because I didn't tell you about my past?
730,00:40:33,00:40:34,"No, no, it has nothing to do with that."
731,00:40:34,00:40:38,I don't care that you were married for a week.
732,00:40:38,00:40:40,Because...
733,00:40:40,00:40:43,I want to marry you.
734,00:40:43,00:40:46,For...forever.
735,00:40:46,00:40:49,Then why are you running from me?
736,00:40:51,00:40:52,'Cause I'm an idiot.
737,00:40:52,00:40:55,And I'm afraid. Of what?
738,00:40:55,00:40:56,Me?
739,00:40:56,00:40:59,"My family? No, no. Um..."
740,00:40:59,00:41:02,Having a family.
741,00:41:03,00:41:05,My father...
742,00:41:05,00:41:10,"wasn't around very much when I grew up and when he was around, he-he really wasn't."
743,00:41:10,00:41:11,He was a scientist.
744,00:41:11,00:41:13,He was always holed up in the basement.
745,00:41:13,00:41:15,You're afraid you will turn into him?
746,00:41:15,00:41:17,Terrified. David...
747,00:41:17,00:41:21,you fear things that have never happened.
748,00:41:21,00:41:22,Don't you think it's a waste of time?
749,00:41:22,00:41:26,Not if I'm wasting it with you.
750,00:41:31,00:41:33,Hey.
751,00:41:33,00:41:36,"I, uh, have your husband's wedding ring."
752,00:41:36,00:41:37,Thanks.
753,00:41:37,00:41:39,Blood test confirmed your illness.
754,00:41:39,00:41:42,I hope someday there's a drug that will help you.
755,00:41:51,00:41:52,Have you ever...
756,00:41:52,00:41:56,flown in your dreams?
757,00:41:56,00:42:01,"Ever since Justin died I'm so numb all day, but when I sleep..."
758,00:42:03,00:42:06,"I'm healthy, I'm free and..."
759,00:42:08,00:42:10,...I fly.
760,00:42:11,00:42:14,And he's with me somehow.
761,00:42:16,00:42:22,And then I wake and... I'm alone but I'm... I'm not as sad.
762,00:42:22,00:42:26,Because I can still feel his presence.
763,00:42:26,00:42:28,You two must've loved each other very much.
764,00:42:28,00:42:30,I'm sorry.
765,00:42:30,00:42:32,"Maybe someday, there'll be a drug that can save me."
766,00:42:32,00:42:34,Maybe not.
767,00:42:36,00:42:43,All I know is when I remember all the good that we had...
768,00:42:43,00:42:44,I'm fearless.
