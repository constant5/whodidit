0,00:00:12,00:00:14,CLAY: What do you need to get?
1,00:00:14,00:00:16,"Actually, it's what you need to get, rook."
2,00:00:16,00:00:18,"Aw, come on, man. We're off duty."
3,00:00:18,00:00:21,You're off when I say you're off.
4,00:00:28,00:00:29,Don't forget the Ho-Hos.
5,00:00:48,00:00:51,Yeah...
6,00:00:52,00:00:54,"I can help you over here, sir."
7,00:00:54,00:00:57,That's not what your light says.
8,00:00:58,00:00:59,Slow night?
9,00:00:59,00:01:00,Kind of.
10,00:01:01,00:01:05,Oh... can't forget the Ho-Hos.
11,00:01:09,00:01:11,(gun clicks faintly)
12,00:01:17,00:01:20,MAN: What the hell is wrong with you people?
13,00:01:20,00:01:22,My wife is still in there!
14,00:01:23,00:01:25,Why isn't anybody helping my wife?!
15,00:01:28,00:01:30,Body count's five.
16,00:01:47,00:01:50,Officer Clay entered the store unaware of a robbery that was in progress.
17,00:01:50,00:01:53,Officer Fromansky came in after he heard a shot fired.
18,00:01:53,00:01:55,Engaged two suspects.
19,00:01:55,00:01:57,Lit the place up.
20,00:02:00,00:02:02,The ski masks are John Does.
21,00:02:02,00:02:05,The rest have wallet IDs.
22,00:02:13,00:02:17,"Woman at the back is Julia Reed, cocktail waitress at the Tangiers."
23,00:02:22,00:02:29,"Man on Aisle Four is Rufus Sanders, cab driver."
24,00:02:43,00:02:45,"How you want us to handle this, Grissom?"
25,00:02:46,00:02:49,Same way you'd eat an elephant...
26,00:02:49,00:02:53,one bite at a time.
27,00:02:57,00:02:59,"Hey, Jim..."
28,00:03:00,00:03:05,"did you know that Charles Manson is only 5'2""?"
29,00:03:05,00:03:07,"Yeah, little guys tend to overcompensate."
30,00:03:07,00:03:10,"Do you remember the, uh, story about..."
31,00:03:10,00:03:14,how and where the marshals found old Charlie when they raided Barker Ranch?
32,00:03:14,00:03:17,"Yeah. I always, uh..."
33,00:03:17,00:03:20,I always liked that story.
34,00:03:26,00:03:27,We need a medic!
35,00:03:30,00:03:34,and Volkswagen. On the road of life there are passengers and there are drivers.
36,00:04:04,00:04:07,"All right, tell me what happened."
37,00:04:07,00:04:10,I was in my radio car when I heard shots fired.
38,00:04:10,00:04:12,I called for backup. I went in.
39,00:04:13,00:04:14,"Clay, talk to me."
40,00:04:14,00:04:15,Clay!
41,00:04:15,00:04:17,(gunfire)
42,00:04:22,00:04:23,How many shots you fire?
43,00:04:23,00:04:27,"Three. No, four. I fired four."
44,00:04:27,00:04:30,BRASS: Then what? I saw my partner on the floor.
45,00:04:30,00:04:32,I went towards him.
46,00:04:32,00:04:34,Second gunman came at me.
47,00:04:40,00:04:43,"How many shots you fire at the second gunman, total?"
48,00:04:44,00:04:46,Maybe-maybe five.
49,00:04:46,00:04:49,I'd taken a shot in my vest.
50,00:04:49,00:04:51,Hard to count under those conditions. Are you sure?
51,00:04:51,00:04:53,"No, I'm not sure. That's why I said maybe..."
52,00:04:55,00:04:57,...but I know I shot four at the third guy.
53,00:04:57,00:04:59,I was going to check on my partner.
54,00:04:59,00:05:01,I caught movement in the back.
55,00:05:01,00:05:03,"Black coat, ski mask, gun..."
56,00:05:03,00:05:04,I put him down.
57,00:05:09,00:05:10,BRASS: He fire at you?
58,00:05:10,00:05:12,Didn't give him a chance.
59,00:05:12,00:05:13,"All right, that's all we need for now."
60,00:05:13,00:05:16,I need your weapon.
61,00:05:17,00:05:19,My partner...
62,00:05:19,00:05:20,I want to be the one to tell his wife.
63,00:05:21,00:05:22,He was my responsibility.
64,00:05:22,00:05:24,BRASS: All right.
65,00:05:26,00:05:29,"All right, look, if you're not going to say it, I will."
66,00:05:30,00:05:34,"Fromansky said he killed three, and there are two dead ski masks in there."
67,00:05:34,00:05:38,"Now, you cranked him up pretty good on that vigilante case last year."
68,00:05:38,00:05:39,Is that going to be a problem?
69,00:05:40,00:05:42,No.
70,00:05:45,00:05:48,"Everybody, could I please have your attention?"
71,00:05:48,00:05:51,"All right, folks, I know that you've been through an awful lot this evening."
72,00:05:51,00:05:59,"If you could just bear with me a little longer, I need to talk with every one of you one at a time, so I promise to get you out of here as quickly as possible."
73,00:06:00,00:06:04,"Is the, uh, guy in black the cocktail waitress' husband?"
74,00:06:04,00:06:07,Yeah. Do you want him first?
75,00:06:07,00:06:09,WILLOWS: I don't think he's ready for me just yet.
76,00:06:09,00:06:11,I'm going to get to him soon enough.
77,00:06:24,00:06:26,What happened to your assault in Henderson?
78,00:06:26,00:06:27,I closed it.
79,00:06:27,00:06:28,Where do you need me?
80,00:06:29,00:06:30,There's two more bodies over by the beer.
81,00:06:30,00:06:33,You got it.
82,00:06:38,00:06:40,Barely cleared the holster.
83,00:06:40,00:06:42,"Reflex, maybe. Pulled the trigger before he had a target."
84,00:06:42,00:06:44,(gunshot)
85,00:06:44,00:06:47,Not quick enough.
86,00:06:52,00:06:56,Those two guys came out of nowhere... made everybody go to the corner.
87,00:06:56,00:06:58,"Where, specifically?"
88,00:06:58,00:07:01,Uh... dry goods.
89,00:07:01,00:07:02,Then one guy grabs Celeste...
90,00:07:06,00:07:07,Which guy?
91,00:07:07,00:07:10,"I was looking at his piece, not his face, okay?"
92,00:07:10,00:07:11,Shotgun or handgun?
93,00:07:11,00:07:17,"Shotgun. He drags her over to the registers, makes her open 'em up. She does."
94,00:07:17,00:07:21,"They're pulling out the cash, and then he sees the cops roll up."
95,00:07:21,00:07:25,"Second guy says, ""Everybody, get down and don't say a freaking word,"" so that's what I did."
96,00:07:26,00:07:28,And then...
97,00:07:29,00:07:30,And then?
98,00:07:30,00:07:31,(gunshots)
99,00:07:31,00:07:34,Ankles and flashes and booms.
100,00:07:34,00:07:37,That's all I remember.
101,00:07:37,00:07:39,And you never moved from that spot?
102,00:07:39,00:07:41,"No, I didn't."
103,00:07:41,00:07:43,Do you have somewhere you need to be?
104,00:07:47,00:07:49,I got to change my pants.
105,00:07:52,00:07:54,Sorry.
106,00:08:26,00:08:29,"MAN: Well, you know, we're not the most modern store around."
107,00:08:29,00:08:31,How long is the surveillance loop?
108,00:08:31,00:08:33,About 24 hours.
109,00:08:42,00:08:45,"What, uh... what happened to these tapes here?"
110,00:08:45,00:08:46,Nothing.
111,00:08:46,00:08:48,"These are active cameras, right?"
112,00:08:48,00:08:50,Those VCRs are busted.
113,00:08:50,00:08:51,Never got 'em fixed.
114,00:08:51,00:08:53,"You know, cutbacks."
115,00:08:53,00:08:54,Over the register and outside works.
116,00:08:54,00:08:56,That's all we really need.
117,00:08:56,00:08:57,"Gotta keep an eye on the employees, right?"
118,00:08:58,00:09:01,They steal worse than the customers.
119,00:09:14,00:09:16,"You know, this guy hit a $75 jackpot."
120,00:09:16,00:09:19,Probably shoving quarters in his pockets when this whole thing went down.
121,00:09:19,00:09:20,The door was 20 feet away.
122,00:09:20,00:09:21,He probably could've made a run for it.
123,00:09:21,00:09:25,"You know, after the MGM Grand fire, they found people fused to slot machines."
124,00:09:26,00:09:27,Never even made it out of their seats.
125,00:09:27,00:09:29,This guy probably thought it was his lucky day.
126,00:09:29,00:09:32,I'm sure he wasn't going to leave without his money.
127,00:09:34,00:09:39,We all just started running when those two psychos started shooting it out with the cop...
128,00:09:39,00:09:41,(gunshots)
129,00:09:44,00:09:46,(screaming)
130,00:09:48,00:09:58,"I took a first aid course about a hundred years ago, so I-I-I tried to keep pressure on the wound, but it just kept bleeding, you know?"
131,00:09:58,00:10:02,"I couldn't leave Rufus all alone, scared, dying."
132,00:10:02,00:10:04,You were friends?
133,00:10:04,00:10:05,"Mm, sort of."
134,00:10:06,00:10:09,He-he'd come in a couple of times a week and play the quarter slots.
135,00:10:09,00:10:13,"From where you and Rufus were, could you see Officer Fromansky?"
136,00:10:13,00:10:15,"Oh, the cop who saved us?"
137,00:10:15,00:10:18,No. I couldn't see anything.
138,00:10:18,00:10:22,I just heard all that gunfire just blasting away.
139,00:10:57,00:10:58,Hey.
140,00:10:58,00:11:00,Hey.
141,00:11:00,00:11:03,Entry wound's on the left side.
142,00:11:03,00:11:04,There's no exit wound?
143,00:11:21,00:11:22,Skin's thicker on the back.
144,00:11:22,00:11:23,Captured the bullet.
145,00:11:23,00:11:25,We'll retrieve it at autopsy.
146,00:11:27,00:11:29,"I was, uh..."
147,00:11:29,00:11:32,holding Julia's hand trying to find a place to hide...
148,00:11:32,00:11:33,somewhere safe.
149,00:11:35,00:11:39,"It was those stupid heels, you know."
150,00:11:39,00:11:41,She was always forgetting to bring her flats to work.
151,00:11:42,00:11:43,(automatic gunfire)
152,00:11:43,00:11:45,(shotgun cocking and firing) (single gunshot)
153,00:11:51,00:11:53,They didn't have to shoot her.
154,00:11:53,00:11:54,They were wearing masks.
155,00:11:54,00:11:56,We didn't even get a good look at them.
156,00:11:56,00:12:00,"Mr. Reed, you can't look for reasons here."
157,00:12:02,00:12:04,We'll have it out in a second.
158,00:12:06,00:12:09,The trick is to apply even pressure all around.
159,00:12:11,00:12:13,Is there something wrong with tweezers?
160,00:12:13,00:12:16,They can mess up the striae.
161,00:12:16,00:12:20,You've got enough to deal with without my toolmarks in the mix.
162,00:12:20,00:12:22,Here we go.
163,00:12:23,00:12:25,Huh.
164,00:12:25,00:12:27,Paper or plastic?
165,00:12:34,00:12:38,Officer Clay's already been processed.
166,00:12:38,00:12:40,We wanted to get him to his family.
167,00:12:40,00:12:42,Did you get prints off the two suspects?
168,00:12:42,00:12:43,"Uh, yeah."
169,00:12:43,00:12:45,They're right here.
170,00:12:45,00:12:48,And we also got bullets from both of them.
171,00:12:49,00:12:50,Good.
172,00:12:55,00:12:57,Prison tattoos.
173,00:12:57,00:13:00,They weren't virgins.
174,00:13:02,00:13:07,"Hi, I was wondering if I might be able to speak with Celeste Turner."
175,00:13:07,00:13:08,"She, uh, has a gunshot wound."
176,00:13:09,00:13:11,She was brought in from the grocery store robbery.
177,00:13:11,00:13:14,Right. Curtain Three.
178,00:13:14,00:13:17,Just out of surgery. Stable.
179,00:13:17,00:13:18,"She's still pretty doped up, though."
180,00:13:19,00:13:21,You're going to have to come back later.
181,00:13:21,00:13:22,You going to need these?
182,00:13:22,00:13:24,Yes. Thank you.
183,00:13:24,00:13:31,What can you tell me about the little boy who was also brought in from the robbery incident?
184,00:13:31,00:13:34,Minor injuries. He's fine. Mostly shock.
185,00:13:34,00:13:36,He's with his mom.
186,00:13:36,00:13:37,"Hell of a night, huh?"
187,00:13:37,00:13:39,"Take your kid to work, both end up shot."
188,00:13:39,00:13:44,"Wait a minute. So, the little boy's mother is Celeste Turner?"
189,00:13:44,00:13:45,Yeah.
190,00:14:09,00:14:12,WILLOWS: Son of a bitch was behind her the whole time.
191,00:14:12,00:14:13,Yeah.
192,00:14:15,00:14:16,(sighs)
193,00:14:16,00:14:18,"Okay, here's what I got so far..."
194,00:14:19,00:14:21,There's our two DOA suspects.
195,00:14:22,00:14:25,Looks like they just walked in off the street.
196,00:14:27,00:14:31,WILLOWS: Is there any sign of Fromansky's mystery gunner?
197,00:14:31,00:14:37,"No. All the cars in the parking lot were accounted for, and the loading dock out back was deserted, so..."
198,00:14:37,00:14:38,(typing)
199,00:14:38,00:14:40,This is the only view of what went down.
200,00:14:46,00:14:47,And see here?
201,00:14:47,00:14:49,Here comes our cop.
202,00:14:49,00:14:52,"Three, four feet away, doesn't even see him."
203,00:14:52,00:14:59,The thing I hate the most is the bad guys always know if there's going to be a gunfight.
204,00:15:01,00:15:04,Officer Clay's one shot went into the floor.
205,00:15:04,00:15:05,The bullet fragmented.
206,00:15:05,00:15:07,That's probably how that kid got hit.
207,00:15:07,00:15:13,"But Officer Fromansky's Beretta and that suspect's TEC-9, they both had hollow .9 millimeters."
208,00:15:13,00:15:16,"Between the two of them, they shot off 18 rounds."
209,00:15:16,00:15:18,"Shotgun was a Mossberg, model 500."
210,00:15:18,00:15:19,Eight rounds fired.
211,00:15:19,00:15:22,"Ammo was double-aught buckshot, nine pellets per shell."
212,00:15:22,00:15:27,"18 bullets, a total of 26 shells, 72 pellets. Enjoy."
213,00:15:31,00:15:33,Firing two shots!
214,00:16:56,00:16:58,Warrick.
215,00:17:05,00:17:07,"Grissom, we got a problem."
216,00:17:07,00:17:08,Only one?
217,00:17:08,00:17:11,We've identified all the bullets recovered at the scene.
218,00:17:11,00:17:14,There's no evidence of a third gunmen.
219,00:17:14,00:17:15,It gets worse.
220,00:17:15,00:17:19,The bullet that killed the cocktail waitress-- it came from Fromansky's gun.
221,00:17:24,00:17:25,"BRASS: How you feeling, Officer?"
222,00:17:25,00:17:27,Little sore.
223,00:17:27,00:17:30,Desk duty hurts a lot more.
224,00:17:30,00:17:33,Is there anything you want to add to your statement?
225,00:17:33,00:17:37,What's he saying I did this time?
226,00:17:37,00:17:39,A bullet from your gun killed a cocktail waitress.
227,00:17:42,00:17:43,A ricochet.
228,00:17:43,00:17:45,GRISSOM: No.
229,00:17:45,00:17:46,A clean shot.
230,00:17:46,00:17:48,Not possible.
231,00:17:48,00:17:50,BRASS: No one at the scene saw a third gunman.
232,00:17:50,00:17:52,I would never shoot at a civilian.
233,00:17:52,00:17:56,"I saw a guy wearing a ski mask, dark coat, holding a gun."
234,00:17:56,00:17:59,"The girl was wearing a black sweater, carrying a purse."
235,00:17:59,00:18:00,I didn't shoot at that.
236,00:18:01,00:18:02,You'd just took a full load in the chest.
237,00:18:02,00:18:03,Maybe you were confused.
238,00:18:03,00:18:05,Wasn't confused.
239,00:18:06,00:18:11,Your statement says that you fired four shots at this third gunman.
240,00:18:11,00:18:12,Yeah.
241,00:18:12,00:18:16,Ballistics evidence shows that you spread five shots over the back wall.
242,00:18:16,00:18:18,So I fired more than I thought. So what.
243,00:18:18,00:18:22,I was engaged with multiple hostile targets You're not back in the Gulf.
244,00:18:22,00:18:23,You're a police officer.
245,00:18:23,00:18:24,You're supposed to identify a target.
246,00:18:24,00:18:26,And that's what I did.
247,00:18:27,00:18:31,"What are you, pissed off because the last time you tried to jam me up didn't work?"
248,00:18:31,00:18:32,"BRASS: Hey, ease up."
249,00:18:32,00:18:34,What I said in my statement is the truth.
250,00:18:34,00:18:38,"The truth is, we have a dead civilian with your bullet in her."
251,00:18:42,00:18:44,This going to the next step?
252,00:18:44,00:18:47,It has to.
253,00:18:48,00:18:52,You're on administrative leave pending an IAB review.
254,00:18:54,00:18:58,There was no way I could warn that cop.
255,00:19:01,00:19:03,I wanted to...
256,00:19:03,00:19:08,"but the guy was right there, under the counter..."
257,00:19:08,00:19:11,pushing his gun right into my stomach.
258,00:19:14,00:19:16,I'm sorry.
259,00:19:16,00:19:19,You're not the one that pulled the trigger.
260,00:19:19,00:19:23,"Ms. Turner, what was your son doing there with you?"
261,00:19:23,00:19:26,"Well, my ex was looking after him that night."
262,00:19:26,00:19:30,Then the son of a bitch shows up at the store.
263,00:19:30,00:19:32,Had a party to go to.
264,00:19:32,00:19:35,Practically shoved Henry out of the car.
265,00:19:35,00:19:36,I mean...
266,00:19:36,00:19:40,I'm not allowed to bring kids to work.
267,00:19:40,00:19:46,"So I snuck Henry into the office, and I told him to stay there."
268,00:19:47,00:19:48,Then?
269,00:19:48,00:19:52,Then those two maniacs came in.
270,00:19:52,00:19:54,They shot that poor policeman.
271,00:19:59,00:20:03,And then everything just went crazy.
272,00:20:03,00:20:05,"I was running, and I ran to go find Henry..."
273,00:20:05,00:20:08,but I couldn't find him anywhere.
274,00:20:09,00:20:10,Henry!
275,00:20:14,00:20:17,That's all I remember.
276,00:20:22,00:20:24,"Henry likes his candy, doesn't he?"
277,00:20:25,00:20:28,He's got five cavities to prove it.
278,00:20:28,00:20:30,How'd you know?
279,00:20:30,00:20:34,"Well, we found him in a storage cabinet, near the candy rack."
280,00:20:34,00:20:37,He never listens to me.
281,00:20:39,00:20:43,"STOKES: Double counts, two people in the room at all times."
282,00:20:43,00:20:48,"When you're done, match the total amounts with the register receipts, okay?"
283,00:20:48,00:20:55,"So, explain to me what all the money was doing in the registers and not the store safe."
284,00:20:55,00:20:58,See that light? It's called a halo.
285,00:20:58,00:21:01,It's keyed to the sensor in the cash register.
286,00:21:01,00:21:07,"Now, at a preset amount, that light goes off, letting the store manager know it's time to transfer the cash to the safe."
287,00:21:07,00:21:09,Now check this out...
288,00:21:09,00:21:11,(typing)
289,00:21:14,00:21:16,Most of the halos are lit.
290,00:21:16,00:21:19,"Maximum cash, just lying in the drawers."
291,00:21:19,00:21:21,"So, those guys did their homework."
292,00:21:21,00:21:24,They picked the perfect time to hit. Mm-hmm.
293,00:21:24,00:21:30,"AFIS hits on our suspects, both just recently released from five-year sentences at Lompoc."
294,00:21:30,00:21:32,California boys.
295,00:21:32,00:21:33,Born and raised.
296,00:21:33,00:21:35,Okay. Let's do this.
297,00:21:35,00:21:39,Officer Clay was killed by a single close-range shotgun blast to the back of the head.
298,00:21:39,00:21:42,Excessive penetration and laceration of the brain.
299,00:21:42,00:21:44,Suspect Clyde Tremmel...
300,00:21:44,00:21:47,The TEC-9 guy.
301,00:21:47,00:21:53,"Two distant-range, medium-caliber gunshot wounds to the front of the chest, with penetration of the lung and heart."
302,00:21:54,00:21:55,Suspect Jack Delver...
303,00:21:55,00:21:57,GRISSOM: Shotgun guy.
304,00:21:57,00:22:05,"One distant-range, medium-caliber gunshot wound to the forehead. The bullet penetrated the brain and was recovered in the occipital lobe."
305,00:22:06,00:22:08,"Rufus Sanders, bystander..."
306,00:22:08,00:22:11,Five scattered buckshot perforations on the outer thigh.
307,00:22:11,00:22:14,"One severed the femoral artery, resulting in massive hemorrhage."
308,00:22:14,00:22:18,"And Julia Reed, cocktail waitress."
309,00:22:18,00:22:21,Single medium-caliber gunshot wound to the left chest.
310,00:22:21,00:22:28,"The bullet perforated the lung and thoracic aorta, then perforated the opposite lung. And that's it."
311,00:22:28,00:22:30,"Thanks, Doc."
312,00:22:37,00:22:39,"Catherine, something bothering you?"
313,00:22:39,00:22:41,A little.
314,00:22:41,00:22:44,"Look, I came here to pick up my wife's body."
315,00:22:44,00:22:45,I already gave you my statement.
316,00:22:45,00:22:49,"Well, we just need a few more details before we can release the body."
317,00:22:49,00:22:50,I promise this won't be long.
318,00:22:51,00:22:52,What?
319,00:22:52,00:22:57,"Well, you said that your wife fell during the gunfight, that that's how you got separated."
320,00:22:57,00:22:58,Yeah.
321,00:22:58,00:23:02,Do you recall exactly how she fell?
322,00:23:02,00:23:03,"Well, what do you mean?"
323,00:23:03,00:23:04,How did she land?
324,00:23:04,00:23:09,"Did she land sideways, backwards...?"
325,00:23:09,00:23:12,"She fell forward, I think."
326,00:23:12,00:23:13,She fell forward.
327,00:23:13,00:23:17,"So her hands broke the fall, landed on her knees?"
328,00:23:17,00:23:18,Yeah.
329,00:23:19,00:23:26,"Well, there weren't any bruises or scrapes on her knees or elbows, which is leading me to believe that she didn't fall."
330,00:23:26,00:23:28,"Well, what's-what's the difference?"
331,00:23:28,00:23:29,She's dead.
332,00:23:30,00:23:39,"Mr. Reed, there were a lot of bullets flying around that store and a lot of victims, and every detail is important, but they don't help if they're not accurate."
333,00:23:41,00:23:43,"Well, when we started running..."
334,00:23:45,00:23:46,she was right behind me.
335,00:23:46,00:23:48,(gunshot and ricochet)
336,00:23:48,00:23:52,(five gunshots)
337,00:23:52,00:23:58,She froze up.
338,00:23:58,00:24:02,Just stood there looking right at me...
339,00:24:02,00:24:05,scared out of her mind.
340,00:24:05,00:24:09,"I... yelled at her to get down, to come over to me."
341,00:24:11,00:24:14,Sh-She wouldn't move.
342,00:24:14,00:24:17,I mean I'm...
343,00:24:17,00:24:20,I'm pretty sure I yelled.
344,00:24:20,00:24:23,GRISSOM: Highlight the shots that killed the TEC-9 shooter.
345,00:24:25,00:24:29,Fromansky said that he fired three or four shots at that target.
346,00:24:29,00:24:31,He fired four.
347,00:24:31,00:24:32,That accounts for those shots.
348,00:24:40,00:24:44,"Okay, the guy with the shotgun was killed with... one bullet."
349,00:24:44,00:24:48,"Well, those four shots were definitely meant for him."
350,00:24:48,00:24:53,But this shot is closer to the second gunman than it is to the cocktail waitress.
351,00:24:53,00:24:58,"Well, Fromansky was turning when he fired so his shots were spread out."
352,00:25:14,00:25:16,Okay.
353,00:25:16,00:25:17,(typing)
354,00:25:17,00:25:22,Which means Fromansky fired four shots at a target at the back of the store.
355,00:25:23,00:25:24,Just like he said he did.
356,00:25:24,00:25:25,Yeah.
357,00:25:29,00:25:35,MAN: At the walk-through you said that you saw a third suspect at the back of the store.
358,00:25:35,00:25:37,Why did you make the decision to shoot?
359,00:25:37,00:25:39,I was in fear for my life.
360,00:25:39,00:25:41,Did you see a weapon?
361,00:25:41,00:25:42,Yes.
362,00:25:42,00:25:44,What kind?
363,00:25:45,00:25:48,A semiautomatic pistol.
364,00:25:48,00:25:50,So you fired first.
365,00:25:50,00:25:51,Yes.
366,00:25:51,00:25:53,Four times. Yes.
367,00:25:53,00:25:57,Can you explain the lack of evidence for a third suspect at the scene?
368,00:25:57,00:25:59,That's not my job.
369,00:26:02,00:26:06,"Right or wrong, there'll be guys on the job who'll think this was personal."
370,00:26:06,00:26:08,They'd be wrong.
371,00:26:08,00:26:12,Did you see Julia Reed in your line of fire?
372,00:26:12,00:26:13,No.
373,00:26:15,00:26:23,"According to Supervising Criminalist Grissom's report, you had an unobstructed view of Ms. Reed, so how do you explain the fact that you didn't see her?"
374,00:26:25,00:26:27,I can't.
375,00:26:27,00:26:32,You don't deny that a bullet from your weapon killed her?
376,00:26:32,00:26:35,I'm not denying that.
377,00:26:35,00:26:38,But you can't explain it?
378,00:26:39,00:26:42,No.
379,00:26:42,00:26:45,"Look, your partner was dead."
380,00:26:46,00:26:47,You'd been shot.
381,00:26:47,00:26:51,You saw someone you thought was a suspect and you fired.
382,00:26:51,00:26:56,"Under those circumstances, any one of us could make a mistake."
383,00:26:56,00:26:59,Did you?
384,00:27:02,00:27:06,"Officer Fromansky, answer the question."
385,00:27:11,00:27:13,"He says yes, he's a bad cop."
386,00:27:13,00:27:17,"He says no, he's a liar."
387,00:27:17,00:27:22,Maybe he really doesn't know what happened.
388,00:27:29,00:27:30,BROWN: A little over.
389,00:27:30,00:27:33,Perfect.
390,00:27:33,00:27:36,Let's say I'm Fromansky.
391,00:27:41,00:27:44,There's nothing between Fromansky and the cocktail waitress.
392,00:27:44,00:27:46,I got a clean view and a clear shot.
393,00:27:49,00:27:53,"GRISSOM: Hey, take a look at this."
394,00:27:53,00:28:01,The cracks in the glass from shot 22 are terminated by the cracks from shot 23.
395,00:28:01,00:28:03,(glass shattering)
396,00:28:10,00:28:13,"So, shot 23 had to occur before shot 22."
397,00:28:13,00:28:20,"Which means that Fromansky was firing from left to right, not right to left."
398,00:28:27,00:28:30,Four shots on a level spread.
399,00:28:30,00:28:32,He was shooting at a moving target.
400,00:28:32,00:28:36,"According to Catherine's witness, the cocktail waitress wasn't moving."
401,00:28:36,00:28:38,She was a stationary target.
402,00:28:40,00:28:46,"So, if he was shooting at a moving target, where was it moving to?"
403,00:29:07,00:29:09,We have the surveillance tape.
404,00:29:09,00:29:15,"Shows nothing going on here before, during or after the robbery."
405,00:29:16,00:29:22,"Well, just because it shows nothing doesn't mean it's seeing everything."
406,00:29:24,00:29:26,"BROWN: You can see me now, right?"
407,00:29:26,00:29:28,Keep moving to your right.
408,00:29:28,00:29:30,All right.
409,00:29:30,00:29:32,Keep going.
410,00:29:32,00:29:33,I'm still in?
411,00:29:33,00:29:34,Keep going.
412,00:29:34,00:29:36,Right there.
413,00:29:36,00:29:37,NOW you're out.
414,00:29:54,00:29:55,Tell me what you see.
415,00:29:55,00:29:58,A getaway.
416,00:29:58,00:30:00,(metallic scraping)
417,00:30:04,00:30:07,We found metal paint scrapings and skid marks.
418,00:30:07,00:30:08,Both recent on that loading dock.
419,00:30:08,00:30:10,These guys definitely had a wheelman.
420,00:30:10,00:30:13,"Yeah, guy slips in after everything gets started."
421,00:30:13,00:30:15,"During the confusion, nobody sees him."
422,00:30:15,00:30:17,Or no one that was alive to tell anyway.
423,00:30:17,00:30:19,Except Fromansky. Yeah.
424,00:30:19,00:30:20,"Well, the suspects knew there was a blind spot."
425,00:30:21,00:30:22,It has to be an inside job.
426,00:30:22,00:30:23,"Oh, no doubt."
427,00:30:23,00:30:27,Matched the cash from the garbage bag to the register receipts-- $878 was missing.
428,00:30:27,00:30:29,Somebody came out ahead.
429,00:30:29,00:30:30,Inside guy?
430,00:30:30,00:30:32,"Well, I'll run the employees."
431,00:30:32,00:30:35,Maybe somebody's got a record.
432,00:30:46,00:30:49,Ran your paint chips through PPG and DuPont.
433,00:30:49,00:30:50,Got a hit.
434,00:30:50,00:30:52,Aegean blue Honda Accord.
435,00:30:52,00:30:54,Popular color.
436,00:30:54,00:30:55,They carried it over for four years.
437,00:30:55,00:30:56,Go figure.
438,00:30:57,00:30:59,I'm a teal man myself.
439,00:30:59,00:31:01,You?
440,00:31:03,00:31:05,Stupid question.
441,00:31:05,00:31:08,"Anyway, model years '84 to '87."
442,00:31:08,00:31:10,I'll put out a broadcast.
443,00:31:10,00:31:11,"Thanks, Hodges."
444,00:31:11,00:31:12,Sure.
445,00:31:18,00:31:21,"Before this goes any deeper, I want to hear it from you."
446,00:31:22,00:31:24,Are you going to try to screw me on this?
447,00:31:28,00:31:30,Well?
448,00:31:30,00:31:34,I guess it depends on whether I get stuck in traffic on the way to your hearing.
449,00:31:45,00:31:48,"BRASS: So, this car was reported stolen about, uh, oh, about three weeks ago."
450,00:31:49,00:31:50,Why don't you take the front.
451,00:31:50,00:31:53,I'll take the back.
452,00:32:28,00:32:31,pH 13. Sodium hydroxide.
453,00:32:42,00:32:45,Got a cell phone.
454,00:32:45,00:32:47,There's a lot of scung on it.
455,00:32:47,00:32:52,"Won't be too good for prints, but let me check the call history."
456,00:32:55,00:32:57,Same number keeps popping up.
457,00:33:03,00:33:06,(recording on phone): Best Bargain is temporarily closed.
458,00:33:06,00:33:08,Please check back tomorrow.
459,00:33:08,00:33:11,"Well, this is interesting."
460,00:33:11,00:33:17,"Before the robbery went down, somebody at the store was very eager to talk to our suspects."
461,00:33:18,00:33:19,Same number.
462,00:33:19,00:33:20,Yeah?
463,00:33:21,00:33:23,Maybe he can tell us who.
464,00:33:28,00:33:29,Todd Hallickey.
465,00:33:29,00:33:34,"Look, I don't know why you guys brought me here, but you got no right tossing my apartment."
466,00:33:34,00:33:39,"We matched your prints from a stolen car off the prints from a prior car theft, and bingo, we had a match."
467,00:33:39,00:33:41,Got a warrant for your apartment.
468,00:33:42,00:33:44,I don't boost cars no more.
469,00:33:44,00:33:46,"(chuckles): Yeah, right."
470,00:33:47,00:33:48,"Oh, wait. No, I..."
471,00:33:48,00:33:53,I was looking into getting some wheels a couple of weeks ago.
472,00:33:53,00:33:57,I test-drove this old Honda Accord this guy was trying to unload.
473,00:33:57,00:34:02,An '86 Aegean blue with matching velour interior?
474,00:34:02,00:34:03,"Yeah, that was it."
475,00:34:03,00:34:05,Must be how my print got there.
476,00:34:06,00:34:08,Didn't buy the car.
477,00:34:08,00:34:10,Guy seemed kind of shady.
478,00:34:10,00:34:15,"BRASS: You wouldn't happen to remember this shady guy's name, would you?"
479,00:34:15,00:34:16,HALLICKEY: Come on.
480,00:34:16,00:34:19,No one keeps track of stuff like that.
481,00:34:19,00:34:21,Right.
482,00:34:22,00:34:25,"You own any firearms, Mr. Hallickey?"
483,00:34:25,00:34:26,"No, sir, I'm on parole."
484,00:34:27,00:34:30,"Besides, I don't believe in guns."
485,00:34:30,00:34:32,They're dangerous.
486,00:34:32,00:34:34,"You know, that's a nasty injury you got there, Todd."
487,00:34:34,00:34:36,Looks kind of painful.
488,00:34:36,00:34:37,How'd you get it?
489,00:34:37,00:34:38,It's a rash.
490,00:34:38,00:34:41,Looks like a chemical burn to me.
491,00:34:41,00:34:43,You know what sodium hydroxide is?
492,00:34:43,00:34:45,Never heard of it.
493,00:34:45,00:34:47,It's the active ingredient in drain cleaner.
494,00:34:47,00:34:51,"It opens up the pipes, dissolves flesh and fabrics."
495,00:34:57,00:35:02,"Look, you want to pin that car on me, you go ahead and try."
496,00:35:02,00:35:05,I got this off the jacket from your apartment.
497,00:35:05,00:35:07,What the hell is this?
498,00:35:07,00:35:08,BROWN: It's a bullet wipe.
499,00:35:08,00:35:11,A test for lead.
500,00:35:14,00:35:16,Congratulations.
501,00:35:16,00:35:18,You passed.
502,00:35:22,00:35:25,Hallickey's got no connection to the grocery store.
503,00:35:25,00:35:26,He was just the wheel man.
504,00:35:26,00:35:28,"Still, he's looking at four counts of felony murder."
505,00:35:28,00:35:30,But he's not talking. He lawyered up.
506,00:35:31,00:35:32,We got a bullet hole in a jacket.
507,00:35:32,00:35:34,That's not even enough to prove that he was in the store.
508,00:35:35,00:35:35,What about the cash?
509,00:35:36,00:35:36,It wasn't in his apartment.
510,00:35:37,00:35:38,Maybe somebody else took it.
511,00:35:39,00:35:40,Almost $900 in small bills?
512,00:35:40,00:35:43,We'd have noticed pockets bulging with a wad like that.
513,00:35:43,00:35:46,What about the calls from the grocery store to the suspect's cell?
514,00:35:47,00:35:49,"That could have been somebody giving the ""go"" signal."
515,00:35:49,00:35:50,There's no way to tell who.
516,00:35:50,00:35:56,"The store runs off of an old PBX system, and every call that comes in goes back to the same number."
517,00:35:56,00:35:59,"Every employee was near a phone, so, it could have been anybody."
518,00:35:59,00:36:00,"Hey, y'all."
519,00:36:00,00:36:02,Ran the criminal records for the employees.
520,00:36:02,00:36:04,Came up with a Raul Valdez.
521,00:36:04,00:36:05,Freight loader.
522,00:36:05,00:36:07,He clocked in for work that night.
523,00:36:07,00:36:09,Never clocked out.
524,00:36:10,00:36:13,No one by that name interviewed at the scene?
525,00:36:14,00:36:15,Here's the kicker.
526,00:36:15,00:36:17,"A few years ago, he spent some time in prison."
527,00:36:17,00:36:18,Lompoc.
528,00:36:18,00:36:22,"So, Brass is trying to find him now."
529,00:37:06,00:37:07,I got to change my pants.
530,00:37:33,00:37:37,You left something in the store besides a urine stain.
531,00:37:40,00:37:42,"Just a little too tempting, huh?"
532,00:37:42,00:37:46,All that cash just sitting there right in front of your face...
533,00:37:47,00:37:49,(gunshot)
534,00:37:52,00:37:57,"Look, I go to that store to bag groceries, not to get my ass shot off."
535,00:37:57,00:38:00,I figure I earned the money.
536,00:38:00,00:38:01,Kind of like working overtime.
537,00:38:01,00:38:03,"Might as well get something for all your trouble, right?"
538,00:38:04,00:38:07,Considering the fact that your nice little robbery had gone straight to hell.
539,00:38:07,00:38:08,"Whoa, wait a minute."
540,00:38:08,00:38:09,You think...?
541,00:38:09,00:38:11,No way.
542,00:38:11,00:38:12,It was an inside job.
543,00:38:12,00:38:14,You knew the registers were full.
544,00:38:14,00:38:17,Those gunmen had help from an employee.
545,00:38:17,00:38:18,"Not from me, they didn't."
546,00:38:18,00:38:23,"Look, you want to bust me for the money, go ahead, I took it."
547,00:38:23,00:38:25,But I did not set the thing up.
548,00:38:37,00:38:41,"You know, Hodges already analyzed trace on the bullets."
549,00:38:41,00:38:43,"Yeah, I wanted to take a look myself."
550,00:38:43,00:38:45,He'll take it personally.
551,00:38:45,00:38:46,Good.
552,00:38:50,00:38:56,The report says that the cocktail waitress was wearing a black wool sweater.
553,00:38:56,00:39:00,Was she also wearing something polyester?
554,00:39:00,00:39:02,No.
555,00:39:02,00:39:04,Take a look at this.
556,00:39:09,00:39:11,WARRICK: Black fibers.
557,00:39:11,00:39:13,Probably synthetic.
558,00:39:14,00:39:16,Mixed in with the wool.
559,00:39:18,00:39:23,If their gunman was wearing a black polyester jacket...
560,00:39:23,00:39:27,Fromansky claims that he was tunnel-visioned on the gunman.
561,00:39:27,00:39:33,"So, it's possible that he never even saw the cocktail waitress."
562,00:39:49,00:39:52,You may have just saved Fromansky's ass.
563,00:39:54,00:39:56,"Hey, Catherine, how'd it go with the bag boy?"
564,00:39:56,00:40:00,"He admitted to swiping the cash, but he wouldn't cop to the robbery."
565,00:40:00,00:40:02,Then I have something you should see.
566,00:40:02,00:40:10,"I was going back through the surveillance tapes covering the loading dock, thinking I might find someone scouting a blind spot, you know?"
567,00:40:10,00:40:13,"But instead, I found this."
568,00:40:13,00:40:17,Two nights before the robbery.
569,00:40:17,00:40:20,There.
570,00:40:20,00:40:21,See that?
571,00:40:21,00:40:23,One more time.
572,00:40:26,00:40:30,"STOKES: That camera's stationary, so..."
573,00:40:30,00:40:33,Somebody moved the camera.
574,00:40:35,00:40:38,You used to part-time at the Forum shops.
575,00:40:38,00:40:40,We got your prints off your work card.
576,00:40:41,00:40:45,It was the same print that we got off the loading dock surveillance camera.
577,00:40:52,00:40:57,"Raul Valdez, an ex-con-- your co-worker."
578,00:40:57,00:41:01,You got him to give you the names of some guys to do the job.
579,00:41:01,00:41:05,You give them the best time to hit the registers.
580,00:41:05,00:41:08,You tell them where to park.
581,00:41:08,00:41:10,It's a good plan.
582,00:41:10,00:41:14,Until your ex showed up and leaves you with your kid.
583,00:41:14,00:41:19,"Then you panic, and you call your guys, try to call it off, but they won't listen."
584,00:41:19,00:41:23,"If that's what happened, that could go in your favor."
585,00:41:24,00:41:26,"When we find Raul, he'll give you up in a heartbeat."
586,00:41:26,00:41:29,I think I need to get a lawyer.
587,00:41:29,00:41:32,What you need is come clean and cooperate.
588,00:41:32,00:41:38,"And you better hope and pray the DA doesn't want to put a needle in your arm for killing five people, including a cop."
589,00:41:43,00:41:48,I have been working at that store for five years.
590,00:41:48,00:41:51,38 hours a week.
591,00:41:51,00:41:56,38... not 40.
592,00:41:56,00:41:58,You know why?
593,00:41:58,00:42:05,Because my manager won't give me enough hours to qualify for benefits.
594,00:42:09,00:42:11,I have a kid...
595,00:42:11,00:42:14,with rotten teeth.
596,00:42:19,00:42:22,I never meant for anybody to get hurt.
597,00:42:22,00:42:25,(sniffling)
598,00:42:31,00:42:35,"Officer Fromansky, if you could smile, please?"
599,00:42:35,00:42:36,Thank you; right over here.
600,00:42:36,00:42:38,BRASS: Guy from the mayor's office.
601,00:42:38,00:42:40,Fromansky's getting a commendation.
602,00:42:40,00:42:42,What do you think?
603,00:42:42,00:42:46,"Two dead felons, two dead civilians a dead policeman..."
604,00:42:46,00:42:48,I don't know what to think.
