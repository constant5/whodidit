0	00:00:06	00:00:10	Do you guys ever think maybe we should fix up the shack a little?
1	00:00:10	00:00:12	It's fine. Why fix it? Yeah.
2	00:00:12	00:00:15	I don't know; in case we ever bring girls here or something.
3	00:00:15	00:00:18	Scotty, what girls are we gonna bring besides your mom or your sister?
4	00:00:18	00:00:21	You know what? Fine. Never mind.
5	00:00:21	00:00:24	Yo, guys. The shack door's open.
6	00:00:32	00:00:33	Is that blood?
7	00:00:33	00:00:36	Oh, man, we should go. Come on!
8	00:00:44	00:00:47	Is he dead?
9	00:00:47	00:00:49	He's not moving.
10	00:00:49	00:00:51	That's a lot of blood.
11	00:00:51	00:00:54	Looks like he got shot or something.
12	00:00:54	00:00:55	Whoa.
13	00:00:56	00:00:58	Smooth move, ex-lax!
14	00:01:00	00:01:03	You guys.
15	00:01:03	00:01:04	Money.
16	00:01:04	00:01:05	And a lot of it.
17	00:01:07	00:01:09	Holy crap. We need to go call the cops.
18	00:01:09	00:01:10	What?
19	00:01:20	00:01:25	Well, it doesn't look like he's gonna be making 10 to Yuma, eh, Super Dave?
20	00:01:25	00:01:26	I'd say he's caught his last ride.
21	00:01:27	00:01:32	Name is Roger Mathers, according to his Texas driver's license.
22	00:01:32	00:01:34	Single bullet wound to the chest.
23	00:01:34	00:01:37	Nice powder ring around the entry wound.
24	00:01:37	00:01:42	It looks like he was hiking in the desert, judging from all the dirt and burrs in his socks.
25	00:01:42	00:01:44	Yeah, well, there's no shortage of that around here.
26	00:01:44	00:01:45	No.
27	00:01:45	00:01:47	Hey, Nicky!
28	00:01:47	00:01:48	Hey, uh, give me a second, will you?
29	00:01:48	00:01:49	Yeah.
30	00:01:53	00:01:55	This is, uh, CSI Nick Stokes.
31	00:01:55	00:01:57	This is Sheriff Combs. He's the local law.
32	00:01:57	00:01:58	Stokes. How's it going?
33	00:01:58	00:02:00	Sheriff was telling me he knew the victim.
34	00:02:00	00:02:01	But he's from Texas. How'd you know him?
35	00:02:01	00:02:07	Well, he might've been living in Texas now, but Roger Mathers was born and raised right here in Ellis Springs.
36	00:02:07	00:02:08	I knew him as a kid.
37	00:02:08	00:02:13	The sheriff was telling me that the victim had a moment of fame, or infamy, depending upon how you look at it.
38	00:02:13	00:02:19	Yeah, back when they were kids, he and a couple of buddies, they had the bad luck to run across an armed robbery.
39	00:02:19	00:02:20	One of the kids got killed.
40	00:02:20	00:02:23	Shook up the town pretty bad. (cell phone ringing)
41	00:02:23	00:02:25	Excuse me, I got to take this.
42	00:02:25	00:02:26	Yeah, go for Brass.
43	00:02:26	00:02:29	So, Sheriff, what do you think Roger might've been doing back in town?
44	00:02:29	00:02:31	And what the hell was he doing way out here?
45	00:02:31	00:02:36	Well, he wouldn't be the first guy to come out here chasing a payday, Mr. Stokes.
46	00:02:36	00:02:39	Loot from the robbery was never recovered.
47	00:02:39	00:02:43	There's a million-dollar treasure out here just waiting to be found.
48	00:02:43	00:02:46	Local lore, they say it's still out here somewhere.
49	00:02:46	00:02:47	Huh.
50	00:02:50	00:02:51	What is it, Jim?
51	00:02:51	00:02:53	That was about my daughter.
52	00:02:53	00:02:54	What's wrong?
53	00:02:54	00:02:58	She, uh, just tried to kill herself.
54	00:03:34	00:03:35	We've got an O.D. Female, late 20s.
55	00:03:35	00:03:37	Attempted suicide.
56	00:03:37	00:03:39	Cocktail of clozapine, olanzapine.
57	00:03:39	00:03:40	Breathing steady but shallow.
58	00:03:40	00:03:41	85/40.
59	00:03:41	00:03:44	Get her into three and throw up another bag of ringers, stat. Yes, Doctor.
60	00:03:44	00:03:45	I'm sorry, sir.
61	00:03:45	00:03:47	I'm Captain Jim Brass.
62	00:03:47	00:03:48	Captain, I'm gonna need you to wait.
63	00:03:48	00:03:50	As soon as she's stable, I'll find you.
64	00:03:58	00:03:59	We just heard. So sorry.
65	00:03:59	00:04:01	How you doing?
66	00:04:01	00:04:02	I don't know.
67	00:04:02	00:04:05	D.A. said Ellie was here for a preliminary hearing.
68	00:04:05	00:04:06	She was in a holding cell.
69	00:04:06	00:04:08	She was obviously stockpiling her meds.
70	00:04:08	00:04:10	I mean, I don't think she wanted to kill herself.
71	00:04:10	00:04:13	You know, her attorney is filing an insanity plea.
72	00:04:13	00:04:16	It might be some screwed-up way of strengthening their case.
73	00:04:16	00:04:18	Whatever's going on, this is where you need to be.
74	00:04:18	00:04:19	And don't even think about the Ellis Springs case.
75	00:04:19	00:04:21	We got it covered.
76	00:04:21	00:04:22	You just take care of things here.
77	00:04:22	00:04:24	Thanks.
78	00:04:28	00:04:31	Hey, Sara, find anything in the treasure hunter's car?
79	00:04:31	00:04:34	Well, he wasn't a health food nut, that's for sure.
80	00:04:34	00:04:37	Looks like he ran a solar business down in Plano.
81	00:04:37	00:04:40	His name's on the back as the company owner.
82	00:04:40	00:04:41	Are you kidding me?
83	00:04:41	00:04:43	Selling solar in Texas?
84	00:04:43	00:04:44	What? Texas doesn't have sun?
85	00:04:45	00:04:47	Texas has oil.
86	00:04:47	00:04:51	When I was growing up, you mention something like this, it was blasphemy.
87	00:04:51	00:04:52	Well, these might put your mind at ease.
88	00:04:52	00:04:54	Gasoline receipts.
89	00:04:54	00:04:59	Looking at the where and the whens of his fill-ups, I would say that he drove straight through from Texas to get here.
90	00:04:59	00:05:00	Well, why was he in such a hurry?
91	00:05:00	00:05:02	I don't know.
92	00:05:02	00:05:03	And what is that? Piece of a photo.
93	00:05:03	00:05:05	I found it on the ground near the car.
94	00:05:05	00:05:08	Can't find the rest of it.
95	00:05:08	00:05:10	Well, it kind of looks like an aerial photo.
96	00:05:10	00:05:11	Don't you think?
97	00:05:11	00:05:12	Maybe the lore is true.
98	00:05:12	00:05:16	Aerial photo of the area-- could've been the victim's treasure map.
99	00:05:23	00:05:26	So I called on down to Texas, and I spoke with someone at the victim's company.
100	00:05:26	00:05:28	Did they say why he came racing up here?
101	00:05:28	00:05:30	You know, my guess is, he was racing away from there.
102	00:05:30	00:05:32	Turns out, he had serious money troubles.
103	00:05:32	00:05:34	His company is going under.
104	00:05:34	00:05:40	Got to say, if I found a buried treasure, I'd spend it on something far more exciting than saving my failing company.
105	00:05:40	00:05:41	What do you got in mind?
106	00:05:41	00:05:44	Like a crazy trip or a sexy sports car.
107	00:05:44	00:05:46	Something like that. Uh-huh.
108	00:05:46	00:05:51	So there are definitely prints on that piece of photo you brought in, but pretty much all of them belong to the victim.
109	00:05:51	00:05:53	Pretty much all of them?
110	00:05:53	00:05:56	Well, there is one partial print that's not his, but it's not enough to run.
111	00:05:56	00:06:01	It's interesting, though; it looks like a tented arch pattern, which is really rare.
112	00:06:01	00:06:04	I mean, only, what, five percent of the population has that.
113	00:06:06	00:06:09	Well, Nick just got the phone records of our victim.
114	00:06:09	00:06:13	He made five calls on his drive from Texas to here, all of them to Tyson Briggs.
115	00:06:13	00:06:14	Who's Tyson Briggs?
116	00:06:14	00:06:18	He's one of the other two kids that got tangled in the heist 25 years ago.
117	00:06:20	00:06:22	So were you and Roger still close?
118	00:06:22	00:06:24	You guys still talk?
119	00:06:24	00:06:25	No, not really.
120	00:06:25	00:06:28	Everything changed after that day.
121	00:06:28	00:06:31	That's why it was so weird, him calling out of the blue like that.
122	00:06:31	00:06:32	What'd he want?
123	00:06:32	00:06:34	Wanted to get together.
124	00:06:34	00:06:35	And did you? Yeah.
125	00:06:35	00:06:37	I thought it'd be good to see him, you know?
126	00:06:37	00:06:38	Get caught up.
127	00:06:41	00:06:44	But all Roger could talk about was money.
128	00:06:44	00:06:46	He was kind of frantic.
129	00:06:46	00:06:48	Panicked, even.
130	00:06:48	00:06:50	He must've been in a pretty deep hole.
131	00:06:50	00:06:52	Was he talking about looking for buried treasure?
132	00:06:52	00:06:54	You know, the money from the '89 heist?
133	00:06:54	00:06:57	That was why he was here; that's why he came back.
134	00:06:57	00:07:00	That money was gonna be the answer to all his problems.
135	00:07:00	00:07:01	Hmm.
136	00:07:01	00:07:04	Well, how would he know where to look for it?
137	00:07:04	00:07:06	Well, he didn't say.
138	00:07:06	00:07:09	And tell you the truth, man, I really wasn't that interested.
139	00:07:11	00:07:14	Look, man, I'm not trying to talk bad about the guy now.
140	00:07:14	00:07:15	No, that's all right. I understand. Go ahead.
141	00:07:15	00:07:19	The whole time me and Roger were together, he didn't once mention Scotty.
142	00:07:19	00:07:23	He just kept going on about the money and the treasure and how bad he needed it, man.
143	00:07:23	00:07:28	He didn't... man, he didn't have one single thought about Scotty.
144	00:07:28	00:07:31	And, Scotty, that's the... the boy who was killed?
145	00:07:31	00:07:33	Yeah, we lost our best friend that day.
146	00:07:35	00:07:37	Please, mister, don't shoot us!
147	00:07:37	00:07:39	We won't tell anyone.
148	00:07:43	00:07:44	Ben!
149	00:07:44	00:07:46	What the hell?
150	00:07:46	00:07:48	What are you guys doing?
151	00:07:48	00:07:50	We just came here to hang out, mister, I...
152	00:07:50	00:07:51	Shut up!
153	00:07:54	00:07:55	Hey, bro.
154	00:07:55	00:07:57	It's the best I could do.
155	00:07:57	00:07:58	I couldn't go back to town.
156	00:08:00	00:08:02	Hey, hey.
157	00:08:02	00:08:03	Ben!
158	00:08:03	00:08:05	No! Damn it!
159	00:08:08	00:08:10	You.
160	00:08:10	00:08:12	Grab the bags. You're coming with me.
161	00:08:12	00:08:13	Get over there! No. No, please!
162	00:08:13	00:08:14	I don't want to go! (grunts)
163	00:08:16	00:08:19	Pick up the money now!
164	00:08:19	00:08:21	You two are gonna stay here.
165	00:08:21	00:08:23	Be quiet or your friend here dies.
166	00:08:23	00:08:24	You get it?
167	00:08:24	00:08:26	Guys!
168	00:08:26	00:08:27	Shut up. Pick up the money!
169	00:08:27	00:08:30	Pick it up! (whimpering)
170	00:08:30	00:08:32	Guys! Guys!
171	00:08:32	00:08:34	Guys! Guys!
172	00:08:34	00:08:36	Guys, help!
173	00:08:36	00:08:40	We ran as fast as we could back to town to get the sheriff.
174	00:08:40	00:08:43	By that time, it was too late.
175	00:08:43	00:08:45	We never saw Scotty again.
176	00:08:45	00:08:49	I grew up with two great friends, man.
177	00:08:49	00:08:51	You know, the kind you never forget.
178	00:08:51	00:08:54	Now they're both gone.
179	00:08:54	00:08:56	Well, I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Briggs.
180	00:08:56	00:08:58	Yeah, yeah.
181	00:09:02	00:09:04	I just heard about Ellie.
182	00:09:04	00:09:07	How is she?
183	00:09:07	00:09:09	She's in an induced coma.
184	00:09:09	00:09:11	She's stable, so...
185	00:09:11	00:09:13	How are you holding up?
186	00:09:13	00:09:17	After all that's happened, I don't even know what the hell I'm doing here.
187	00:09:17	00:09:20	There's a part of me that wishes she would just not wake up.
188	00:09:20	00:09:25	I mean, I know how horrible that sounds, but, uh...
189	00:09:25	00:09:29	She's put you through a lot, Jim.
190	00:09:29	00:09:32	You know she's here for a court hearing, right?
191	00:09:32	00:09:38	She's gonna testify in a court that I drove her to madness, to murder.
192	00:09:38	00:09:43	You are not responsible for what she did or what she's done to herself.
193	00:09:43	00:09:45	I'm not so sure.
194	00:09:47	00:09:50	So what do we got on our murdered treasure hunter?
195	00:09:50	00:09:52	Well, we are working on that right now.
196	00:09:52	00:09:55	We just pulled all the files from the original '89 case.
197	00:09:55	00:10:01	These were our suspects involved, a pair of local brothers, Paul and Ben O'Malley.
198	00:10:01	00:10:10	They robbed the house of a mid-level Mob boss named Michael Scarno, and in the process, one of them was shot.
199	00:10:10	00:10:14	According to the police report, they made off with close to a hundred grand and some valuables.
200	00:10:14	00:10:16	That's all?
201	00:10:16	00:10:19	Nick talked like there was this big treasure involved.
202	00:10:19	00:10:24	Well, the cash and watches are part of the official theft report.
203	00:10:24	00:10:31	But I remember when I was writing my Vegas mob book, I heard about this Michael Scarno.
204	00:10:31	00:10:37	He was an art theft guy, and he had acquired a particular piece of sculpture.
205	00:10:37	00:10:39	A Persian stone lion.
206	00:10:39	00:10:42	Wow, that's over 2,000 years old.
207	00:10:42	00:10:44	And it was just one of a pair.
208	00:10:44	00:10:48	The other one just sold at a British auction for close to $10 million.
209	00:10:48	00:10:51	Well, that could explain the why now of it all.
210	00:10:51	00:10:55	Could be that our victim heard about the auction and then went looking for the remaining statue.
211	00:10:55	00:10:58	How do the three local kids fit into the original story?
212	00:10:58	00:11:00	Wrong place at the wrong time.
213	00:11:00	00:11:03	The older O'Malley found them in a railroad shack.
214	00:11:03	00:11:05	Brother was dead.
215	00:11:05	00:11:08	O'Malley then tried to make a getaway and took one of the younger kids with him.
216	00:11:08	00:11:10	Scotty Gates.
217	00:11:10	00:11:17	O'Malley was caught two hours later out near Hoover Dam, but by then the boy and the cash were gone.
218	00:11:17	00:11:22	Now, the sheriff has always contended that the kid ended up at the bottom of Lake Mead.
219	00:11:22	00:11:23	The body was never found?
220	00:11:23	00:11:25	O'Malley didn't say what he did with the kid?
221	00:11:25	00:11:27	He never got a chance to.
222	00:11:27	00:11:29	He was found dead in his jail cell the next morning.
223	00:11:29	00:11:32	No body. No money. No trial.
224	00:11:32	00:11:34	Seems a little bit more than sketchy, don't you think?
225	00:11:34	00:11:37	Case of small-town justice, maybe?
226	00:11:37	00:11:38	Or small-town corruption.
227	00:11:38	00:11:42	Maybe the local cops knew what kind of stash Scarno was sitting on.
228	00:11:42	00:11:45	So this is what's left of Scotty Gates.
229	00:11:45	00:11:51	An entire kid's existence comes down to a baseball hat and a pair of glasses.
230	00:11:51	00:11:55	Oh, I can't even imagine what his parents must've been going through.
231	00:11:55	00:11:57	Wait a minute.
232	00:11:57	00:12:00	Looks like a partial print.
233	00:12:00	00:12:01	It could be a tented arch.
234	00:12:01	00:12:06	Sara said she found a tented arch at the Roger Mathers murder scene.
235	00:12:06	00:12:08	I got your text. You said it was urgent.
236	00:12:08	00:12:13	I was looking through the evidence from the '89 case, and I found a fingerprint.
237	00:12:13	00:12:15	It's only a partial, not enough to run.
238	00:12:15	00:12:17	Don't tell me it has a tented arch.
239	00:12:17	00:12:19	It does.
240	00:12:19	00:12:28	Okay, so the one on the left is from the torn photo that you guys found this morning, and the one on the right is from Scotty Gates' glasses 25 years ago.
241	00:12:28	00:12:29	Could they really be the same?
242	00:12:31	00:12:32	It's a match.
243	00:12:34	00:12:37	The fingerprint belongs to a man named Sam Bishop.
244	00:12:37	00:12:42	He is a security guard now, but back in '89, he was a deputy in Ellis Springs under Sheriff Combs.
245	00:12:42	00:12:48	And get this-- he left the department two weeks after the whole thing with Scotty Gates and the heist.
246	00:12:48	00:12:52	Goes a long way to support our theory of a crooked cop.
247	00:12:52	00:12:55	We have his fingerprints at both murder scenes.
248	00:12:55	00:12:59	Could be our killer, I guess, covering up his crimes of the past.
249	00:13:01	00:13:02	Let's take the back.
250	00:13:04	00:13:05	Can I help you with something?
251	00:13:05	00:13:07	Uh, LVPD. Who are you?
252	00:13:07	00:13:09	Karen Bishop. I live here.
253	00:13:09	00:13:11	We're looking for Sam Bishop.
254	00:13:11	00:13:12	We'd like to have a word with him.
255	00:13:12	00:13:14	Um... yeah.
256	00:13:14	00:13:16	I'll let him know you're here.
257	00:13:16	00:13:18	No, no. You know what? That's fine.
258	00:13:18	00:13:19	We'll tell him ourselves. Thank you.
259	00:13:19	00:13:21	Excuse me, you can't go in there.
260	00:13:21	00:13:21	Ma'am.
261	00:13:23	00:13:25	Sam Bishop?
262	00:13:25	00:13:27	LVPD. We need to talk.
263	00:13:30	00:13:33	Let me guess-- about Scotty Gates' murder?
264	00:13:33	00:13:36	I've been waiting 25 years for you to come.
265	00:13:44	00:13:46	You boys are arresting me? You got to be kidding me.
266	00:13:48	00:13:51	Roger Mathers' last night and Scotty Gates' 25 years ago.
267	00:13:51	00:13:53	What the hell are you talking about?
268	00:13:53	00:13:56	My father wasn't involved in any murder.
269	00:13:56	00:13:57	We have a warrant to search the premises as well.
270	00:13:57	00:14:00	You have absolutely no idea what you're doing, do you?
271	00:14:01	00:14:03	Get him out of here.
272	00:14:03	00:14:06	You're making a huge mistake.
273	00:14:06	00:14:07	My father is a good man.
274	00:14:09	00:14:11	Well, we'll have a look around, see for ourselves.
275	00:14:24	00:14:27	The gun that was used to kill Roger Mathers was a nine-mil, right?
276	00:14:27	00:14:31	Yeah, but if it's hidden down here, we got our work cut out for us.
277	00:14:47	00:14:50	Am I the only one getting a mad scientist vibe in here?
278	00:14:50	00:14:53	Thought this guy was a former cop.
279	00:14:57	00:14:59	Ooh, have a look at this.
280	00:15:06	00:15:08	These are the boys from the '89 case.
281	00:15:08	00:15:10	Old rabbit's foot.
282	00:15:11	00:15:13	Like a kid would have.
283	00:15:13	00:15:16	Could be a trophy the killer kept from Scotty Gates.
284	00:15:16	00:15:19	Well, it's got an evidence tag on it.
285	00:15:21	00:15:23	And these are all old case files.
286	00:15:23	00:15:27	Just who the hell is this guy?
287	00:15:27	00:15:31	I'm assuming your people didn't find any murder weapon in my house.
288	00:15:31	00:15:32	No, they didn't, Mr. Bishop.
289	00:15:32	00:15:35	But what they did find was-was very interesting.
290	00:15:35	00:15:38	You're one of us, a criminalist.
291	00:15:38	00:15:43	You were working for Ellis Springs Sheriff Department back in 1989.
292	00:15:43	00:15:45	They called me a hobbyist, actually.
293	00:15:45	00:15:49	Well, that was a pretty heavy responsibility for a young deputy.
294	00:15:49	00:15:50	How'd that land on your back?
295	00:15:50	00:15:51	I volunteered.
296	00:15:51	00:15:53	I had a knack for science.
297	00:15:53	00:15:57	We're working an investigation into a murder that took place last night.
298	00:15:57	00:16:02	Your fingerprint was on a torn photograph recovered at the scene.
299	00:16:02	00:16:03	Can you explain that?
300	00:16:03	00:16:05	I retired years ago.
301	00:16:05	00:16:07	Maybe you should figure that one out.
302	00:16:07	00:16:08	You didn't retire.
303	00:16:08	00:16:09	You were fired.
304	00:16:09	00:16:14	You were let go right after the 1989 heist, says here in your file, for insubordination.
305	00:16:14	00:16:15	There was no insubordination.
306	00:16:15	00:16:20	I found evidence that was, uh... inconvenient for Sheriff Combs.
307	00:16:20	00:16:24	Quickest way to bury my evidence was to bury me.
308	00:16:24	00:16:25	Why was the evidence inconvenient for the sheriff?
309	00:16:25	00:16:27	Most charitable scenario?
310	00:16:27	00:16:32	Local kid was gone, presumed dead, along with the two men responsible.
311	00:16:32	00:16:34	Sheriff just wanted the case closed.
312	00:16:34	00:16:36	Least charitable scenario?
313	00:16:36	00:16:39	Sheriff was dirty, in on the heist.
314	00:16:39	00:16:41	I suppose you have some evidence to back that up?
315	00:16:41	00:16:43	Ben and Paul O'Malley.
316	00:16:43	00:16:45	Two brothers that ripped off Michael Scarno's house.
317	00:16:45	00:16:47	They were local troublemakers back then.
318	00:16:47	00:16:50	Got arrested half a dozen times.
319	00:16:50	00:16:56	More than once, Sheriff Combs arranged for them to serve their time working on his house.
320	00:16:56	00:16:58	So you're saying that he knew them well.
321	00:16:58	00:17:00	Well enough he could've hired them to pull off the robbery.
322	00:17:00	00:17:04	Let's be careful about allegations that Sheriff Combs is dirty.
323	00:17:04	00:17:07	Guy has over 30 years under his belt.
324	00:17:07	00:17:11	Yeah, well, 30 years doesn't take away his guilt if he was involved in the original robbery and murder.
325	00:17:11	00:17:12	But we don't know that.
326	00:17:12	00:17:16	Come here. Come here.
327	00:17:16	00:17:17	Let's say I play along.
328	00:17:17	00:17:22	Let's say Sheriff Combs was involved in the original robbery, which ties him to the kid's death.
329	00:17:22	00:17:25	Why would he kill Roger Mathers 25 years after the fact?
330	00:17:25	00:17:29	Maybe Roger and the kids saw more that day than we realized.
331	00:17:29	00:17:32	Now, Roger has come back. He's desperate for money.
332	00:17:32	00:17:36	Maybe his next move is to try to blackmail the sheriff.
333	00:17:36	00:17:38	That's two maybes in three sentences.
334	00:17:38	00:17:40	It does give him motive.
335	00:17:40	00:17:42	Look, I'm not in the man's corner.
336	00:17:42	00:17:44	I'm just saying, proceed with caution.
337	00:17:48	00:17:51	This guy, Sam Bishop-- I'm looking at the forensics he was doing.
338	00:17:51	00:17:53	It's crazy.
339	00:17:53	00:17:55	I mean, he was way, way ahead of his time.
340	00:17:55	00:17:58	Polymorphic protein analysis, analyzing gunshot residue.
341	00:17:58	00:18:01	He has his own formulas here for amino acid stains.
342	00:18:01	00:18:02	Wow.
343	00:18:02	00:18:07	I found all of these aerial photos in Bishop's box.
344	00:18:07	00:18:13	They look a lot like the piece you found by the victim's car, but, I mean, there's not one that's a perfect match.
345	00:18:13	00:18:19	There's not one with a... with a tear on it or anything like that, which means Roger Mathers had the only copy.
346	00:18:19	00:18:21	He had the only treasure map.
347	00:18:21	00:18:23	Explains why Sam Bishop's fingerprint was on it.
348	00:18:23	00:18:25	It was one of his photos.
349	00:18:25	00:18:28	Question is, how did Roger Mathers get it?
350	00:18:28	00:18:30	Sam, these were your photos.
351	00:18:30	00:18:35	That's why your fingerprint's on the fragment that we found near Roger Mathers' car.
352	00:18:35	00:18:37	Did you give him this photograph?
353	00:18:37	00:18:40	No. And I have no idea how he got it.
354	00:18:40	00:18:42	These are all original case photos.
355	00:18:42	00:18:44	Been sitting in the same evidence box for 25 years.
356	00:18:44	00:18:46	Very impressive, actually.
357	00:18:46	00:18:49	It's the kind of mapping we do with drones nowadays.
358	00:18:49	00:18:52	But you didn't have a drone back then, did you?
359	00:18:52	00:18:53	No.
360	00:18:53	00:18:56	But I had this.
361	00:18:56	00:19:01	I mounted a camera from a suspension rig slung beneath a weather balloon.
362	00:19:01	00:19:06	The camera's self-timer was modified to fire off an entire roll of film automatically.
363	00:19:06	00:19:08	Took about a week to map the region.
364	00:19:08	00:19:11	There was no better way to search for Scotty Gates' body.
365	00:19:11	00:19:14	Yeah, I'm-I'm gonna stop you right there, Sam.
366	00:19:14	00:19:16	See, I had a conversation with Michael Scarno's attorney.
367	00:19:16	00:19:21	Discovered an interesting connection between you and the old crime boss.
368	00:19:21	00:19:27	He paid you for those photos, Sam, and that was after you got fired by Sheriff Combs.
369	00:19:27	00:19:30	Hold on a minute-- You weren't looking for the kid's body.
370	00:19:30	00:19:35	Scarno hired you to find his missing loot, his treasure. No, you don't understand...
371	00:19:35	00:19:39	Are you going to deny that you were on Scarno's payroll?
372	00:19:39	00:19:40	No, I'm not.
373	00:19:41	00:19:44	Yes, I took the old man's money.
374	00:19:44	00:19:47	I'd just been fired. I had a little girl to raise.
375	00:19:47	00:19:51	But I never gave a damn about any missing loot, any treasure.
376	00:19:51	00:19:54	It was a chance to find Scotty.
377	00:19:55	00:20:00	Sam, we need the photo that Roger Mathers had last night.
378	00:20:00	00:20:02	Where are the negatives?
379	00:20:03	00:20:08	There it is, the photograph that Roger Mathers was carrying the night he was murdered.
380	00:20:08	00:20:11	The question is, what's so damn special about it that got him killed?
381	00:20:11	00:20:15	Sam Bishop must have scoured these photos back when he took them.
382	00:20:15	00:20:16	He didn't see anything.
383	00:20:16	00:20:19	Yeah, but he was working with 1989 technology.
384	00:20:25	00:20:26	Whoa. Hold it.
385	00:20:26	00:20:28	Do you see that?
386	00:20:28	00:20:30	There's an irregular pattern in the ground.
387	00:20:30	00:20:32	Looks like the dirt had been recently turned over.
388	00:20:32	00:20:37	I can run this against a current satellite photo, get the GPS coordinates.
389	00:20:48	00:20:50	Well, we got to be close.
390	00:20:50	00:20:55	Coordinates we have put us just about on top of it.
391	00:20:55	00:20:57	Yeah. I think we're there.
392	00:21:02	00:21:04	This is recent.
393	00:21:06	00:21:08	Yeah. This hole looks fresh.
394	00:21:08	00:21:10	Look at the impression in the dirt here.
395	00:21:10	00:21:12	Could be from the lion statue.
396	00:21:12	00:21:14	Someone beat us to the treasure.
397	00:21:16	00:21:18	Greg.
398	00:21:22	00:21:25	Looks like a tennis shoe.
399	00:21:25	00:21:27	Or it was, a long time ago.
400	00:21:29	00:21:30	That's a bone.
401	00:21:30	00:21:32	Wasn't just the treasure that's buried here.
402	00:21:33	00:21:36	No.
403	00:21:36	00:21:37	This is Scotty Gates' grave.
404	00:21:49	00:21:52	Here's the cast I pulled from the hole before they started digging.
405	00:21:52	00:21:55	Sure looks like a match for the lion statue to me.
406	00:21:55	00:21:57	Yeah, we found a shovel too.
407	00:21:57	00:22:01	So Scotty Gates and the statue were buried right here all this time.
408	00:22:01	00:22:04	I thought the story was that the kid ended up on the bottom of Lake Mead.
409	00:22:04	00:22:06	Well, that's what Sheriff Combs has always said.
410	00:22:06	00:22:09	Then again, I mean, you heard Sam Bishop's theory.
411	00:22:09	00:22:10	The sheriff was in on the heist.
412	00:22:12	00:22:13	Speak of the devil.
413	00:22:20	00:22:25	So I have to hear through radio traffic that you discovered a grave.
414	00:22:25	00:22:27	We're still in the early stages.
415	00:22:27	00:22:33	If the remains you're digging up there are Scotty Gates, I am still the lead detective on that case.
416	00:22:33	00:22:38	Sheriff, right now, this is part of our investigation into the murder of Roger Mathers.
417	00:22:38	00:22:41	And you found no other evidence that would indicate this is part of my case?
418	00:22:41	00:22:43	You mean like a million-dollar statue?
419	00:22:45	00:22:46	Everything here is going back to our lab.
420	00:22:46	00:22:47	We'll let you know what we find.
421	00:22:54	00:22:57	All these years, he was just a half-mile from town.
422	00:22:57	00:22:59	I should have found him.
423	00:23:02	00:23:06	Scotty's parents were devastated by his disappearance.
424	00:23:06	00:23:07	Whole town was.
425	00:23:07	00:23:11	But his mother-- it just pushed her over the edge.
426	00:23:11	00:23:15	For weeks and months, she posted his picture all over town.
427	00:23:15	00:23:21	She never stopped looking for him, even though, in her heart, I think she knew he was dead.
428	00:23:21	00:23:25	Hard to grieve without knowing what happened.
429	00:23:25	00:23:26	I promised her I'd find Scotty.
430	00:23:26	00:23:29	Did everything I could, but in the end...
431	00:23:29	00:23:31	I let her down.
432	00:23:31	00:23:37	Sam, I want to apologize to you for the assumptions I made earlier.
433	00:23:38	00:23:40	Gentlemen.
434	00:23:40	00:23:41	Doc.
435	00:23:41	00:23:44	I spoke with the forensic odontologist.
436	00:23:44	00:23:48	Dental records confirm the remains are definitely those of Scotty Gates.
437	00:23:48	00:23:49	Okay, thanks.
438	00:23:49	00:23:51	Anything else you can tell us?
439	00:23:51	00:23:54	Well, obviously, my observations are limited by the advanced decomposition.
440	00:23:54	00:23:56	Cause of death out of the question?
441	00:23:56	00:23:57	Not necessarily.
442	00:23:57	00:24:02	I noticed some fracturing here and an indentation.
443	00:24:02	00:24:05	First, I thought it was the result of the body being buried for 25 years.
444	00:24:05	00:24:09	But on closer look, there seems to be some impact compression.
445	00:24:09	00:24:11	Someone struck him in the head.
446	00:24:11	00:24:14	Or he fell and hit his head; it's hard to say which.
447	00:24:14	00:24:15	Do you mind?
448	00:24:15	00:24:17	No.
449	00:24:17	00:24:21	So this jagged mark here, that's the line of impact?
450	00:24:21	00:24:23	Yeah, you can see the compression I mentioned.
451	00:24:23	00:24:25	What do you think?
452	00:24:25	00:24:26	It matches the base of the statue.
453	00:24:26	00:24:28	Mm-hmm.
454	00:24:28	00:24:29	Scotty was killed with the stone lion.
455	00:24:29	00:24:33	Whoever buried that was not hiding treasure.
456	00:24:33	00:24:36	They were ditching their murder weapon.
457	00:24:41	00:24:43	Ellie.
458	00:24:43	00:24:46	How did we get here, huh?
459	00:24:46	00:24:49	How did we get here to this place?
460	00:24:54	00:24:57	Was it because I wasn't your real father?
461	00:24:57	00:25:00	I mean, we never told you; we didn't think it was a big deal.
462	00:25:00	00:25:04	But maybe you instinctively knew and you held it against me.
463	00:25:04	00:25:06	Is that it?
464	00:25:06	00:25:09	Is...
465	00:25:09	00:25:15	I mean, the natural connection between a father and daughter, the bond-- we never had that.
466	00:25:18	00:25:20	Was it because we didn't love each other?
467	00:25:23	00:25:26	I mean, I thought I loved you.
468	00:25:26	00:25:30	I mean, every time you were in trouble, I was there.
469	00:25:30	00:25:32	I came.
470	00:25:32	00:25:34	Tried to save you, help you.
471	00:25:34	00:25:36	I mean, if that's not love...
472	00:25:36	00:25:40	I-I don't know what love is, then.
473	00:25:40	00:25:44	But you kept pushing me away and pushing me away.
474	00:25:44	00:25:46	And now we're here.
475	00:25:49	00:25:51	I can't go on like this, Ellie.
476	00:26:00	00:26:04	I think I've discovered a secret about the most beautiful woman in history.
477	00:26:04	00:26:05	Kate Upton?
478	00:26:05	00:26:06	In history, Henry.
479	00:26:06	00:26:08	I was talking about Cleopatra.
480	00:26:08	00:26:10	Oh. Fascinating, but I am busy.
481	00:26:10	00:26:15	I just came to tell you that I had no luck isolating DNA from the shovel Greg and Sara found by the hole.
482	00:26:15	00:26:20	Something in the sample screwed up your extraction, didn't it?
483	00:26:20	00:26:22	Just as Cleopatra and I expected.
484	00:26:22	00:26:25	(sighs) Fine, I'll bite.
485	00:26:25	00:26:27	What does my screwed-up sample have to do with Cleopatra?
486	00:26:27	00:26:32	Minerals from the Dead Sea, 13 of them not found in water anywhere else in the world.
487	00:26:32	00:26:34	As usual, I'm not following you.
488	00:26:34	00:26:37	There was lotion on the shovel handle.
489	00:26:37	00:26:44	The sample contained a particular proportion of magnesium, bromide, bitumen, calcium, and potassium.
490	00:26:44	00:26:47	The high salt content would explain why my extraction failed.
491	00:26:47	00:26:53	Only one vendor sells a version with the precise mineral proportions that I've identified, and they only offer it online.
492	00:26:53	00:26:57	I'm waiting for a list of local customers as we speak.
493	00:26:59	00:27:06	We found a shovel this morning, out in the desert.
494	00:27:06	00:27:09	It had lotion on the handle, a very specific lotion.
495	00:27:09	00:27:13	You know the stuff I'm talking about, don't you, Karen?
496	00:27:13	00:27:15	Huh?
497	00:27:15	00:27:16	You were out there.
498	00:27:16	00:27:20	I think you went out there and dug up Scotty Gates' grave to get to that treasure.
499	00:27:20	00:27:22	Wait, what do you mean, Scotty's grave?
500	00:27:23	00:27:26	We were just looking for the statue.
501	00:27:26	00:27:27	We?
502	00:27:27	00:27:29	Who'd you go out there with, Karen?
503	00:27:30	00:27:32	Roger. Roger?
504	00:27:32	00:27:34	Roger Mathers?
505	00:27:34	00:27:37	How'd you end up out in the desert with him?
506	00:27:37	00:27:40	I caught Roger breaking into my father's workshop two nights ago.
507	00:27:40	00:27:42	He was desperate to get his hands on some photographs.
508	00:27:42	00:27:44	Your dad's aerial photos.
509	00:27:44	00:27:46	Well, why didn't you just call the cops?
510	00:27:46	00:27:50	I was about to, but then Roger started talking about the treasure.
511	00:27:50	00:27:52	The stone lion, you know?
512	00:27:52	00:27:57	He said it wasn't just lore, that it was really worth something.
513	00:27:57	00:28:00	He thought that with my dad's photos, he could find it.
514	00:28:00	00:28:02	And he offered to cut you in on the deal.
515	00:28:02	00:28:05	That's why you decided to help him, hmm?
516	00:28:05	00:28:07	I figured, why not?
517	00:28:07	00:28:11	If anybody deserves a piece of that treasure, it's me and my father.
518	00:28:11	00:28:14	That case ruined our lives.
519	00:28:14	00:28:17	So the two of you went out there to dig it up, huh?
520	00:28:17	00:28:18	That was the plan.
521	00:28:18	00:28:20	But it didn't happen.
522	00:28:20	00:28:23	We were able to find the spot, pretty much, using the aerial photo.
523	00:28:23	00:28:25	It's got to be close.
524	00:28:25	00:28:28	These look like the pipes that are in the picture.
525	00:28:32	00:28:34	No. No, no.
526	00:28:34	00:28:35	No!
527	00:28:35	00:28:37	Somebody beat us to it.
528	00:28:37	00:28:39	I need the money.
529	00:28:39	00:28:40	God, I need the statue!
530	00:28:40	00:28:42	Hey... No!
531	00:28:42	00:28:43	Just get away from me.
532	00:28:43	00:28:45	Go!
533	00:28:45	00:28:46	I walked away.
534	00:28:46	00:28:50	That was the last time I saw him-- on his knees, crying.
535	00:28:50	00:28:53	I've known Roger since we were kids.
536	00:28:53	00:28:57	I would never hurt him.
537	00:29:11	00:29:14	Come here to tell me you talked to Karen?
538	00:29:14	00:29:16	Your daughter was the one who raided your old case files, Sam.
539	00:29:18	00:29:21	She gave the aerial photos to Roger Mathers.
540	00:29:21	00:29:22	I can't say I'm surprised.
541	00:29:22	00:29:26	Her whole life, she had to put up with my obsession with the case.
542	00:29:26	00:29:27	Makes sense she'd feel entitled.
543	00:29:27	00:29:32	Evidentially, she and Roger went out to the desert and they were digging around.
544	00:29:32	00:29:33	They didn't find anything.
545	00:29:35	00:29:37	But looks like you did.
546	00:29:40	00:29:43	The real stone lion is almost 2,000 years old.
547	00:29:43	00:29:44	This one isn't even finished yet.
548	00:29:48	00:29:49	Cement?
549	00:29:49	00:29:51	Exact size and weight as the original.
550	00:29:51	00:29:53	It's a perfect copy of the murder weapon.
551	00:29:53	00:29:55	Come here, I want to show you something. Look at this.
552	00:29:57	00:30:00	This is a mock-up of the boy's skull, complete with injuries.
553	00:30:00	00:30:02	So what's your plan?
554	00:30:02	00:30:09	Well, I am going to re-enact the murder, try and duplicate the blow that killed Scotty, prove it's consistent with a killer the same size and frame as Sheriff Combs.
555	00:30:09	00:30:11	You really think he did it?
556	00:30:11	00:30:13	Well, that's what I want to find out.
557	00:30:15	00:30:17	Not a bad idea.
558	00:30:17	00:30:19	Is that your way of telling me it's a good idea?
559	00:30:19	00:30:21	Yeah. Yeah, it is. (chuckles)
560	00:30:21	00:30:26	I do think my guys could, uh, offer a few improvements, if you don't mind joining forces.
561	00:30:32	00:30:37	So this is just like yours, only we took it a little bit further.
562	00:30:37	00:30:39	(chuckles) Just a little bit.
563	00:30:39	00:30:41	Well, it's for practical reasons more than anything else.
564	00:30:41	00:30:45	If you were to do the experiment, you'd probably have to destroy about a dozen skulls.
565	00:30:45	00:30:51	But our head here can sustain numerous blows, and the resulting trauma will be simulated by that computer.
566	00:30:51	00:30:59	And I assume that, since we know the extent of the trauma, you can set a target zone for the exact force and angle of the impact.
567	00:30:59	00:31:03	Yes, And that computer will let us know when we perfectly re-create the blow that killed Scotty Gates.
568	00:31:03	00:31:05	Very cool.
569	00:31:06	00:31:08	What are we waiting for?
570	00:31:40	00:31:43	The injuries just aren't consistent with the sheriff's height and build.
571	00:31:43	00:31:45	There's no way the sheriff could've killed Scotty.
572	00:31:45	00:31:50	Well, according to this, the killer was smaller, barely five-feet tall and left-handed.
573	00:31:52	00:31:55	Back when I was a deputy, I used to coach some youth baseball.
574	00:31:55	00:32:01	There was this one kid, a pitcher, a mean southpaw.
575	00:32:04	00:32:06	Mr. Briggs?
576	00:32:06	00:32:08	Think we need to have another talk.
577	00:32:08	00:32:10	I already told you everything I know about Roger.
578	00:32:10	00:32:14	Yeah, but now you're gonna tell me everything you know about Scotty Gates.
579	00:32:14	00:32:16	That's where the killing all started 25 years ago.
580	00:32:23	00:32:24	Please, mister, don't shoot us.
581	00:32:24	00:32:25	We won't tell anyone.
582	00:32:29	00:32:31	I think he's dead.
583	00:32:31	00:32:33	That's what you said before.
584	00:32:35	00:32:36	Come on, grab the bags.
585	00:32:36	00:32:37	Wait, wait, wait, wait!
586	00:32:37	00:32:39	What are you doing? We-we can't.
587	00:32:39	00:32:42	He's dead. He's not gonna use it.
588	00:32:42	00:32:44	Yeah, but it's not ours. We have to call the police.
589	00:32:44	00:32:46	We're not calling anybody.
590	00:32:46	00:32:48	Now, shut up and grab the bags!
591	00:32:48	00:32:49	No.
592	00:32:49	00:32:51	No, this is stupid. We can't!
593	00:32:52	00:32:54	(groans) Don't be a baby!
594	00:32:54	00:32:57	This is our hideout, and whatever's in it is ours.
595	00:32:57	00:32:58	Now shut up...
596	00:33:00	00:33:01	And grab the bags.
597	00:33:03	00:33:04	Idiot, you didn't have to break my glasses.
598	00:33:04	00:33:06	My dad's gonna kill me!
599	00:33:06	00:33:08	Here, now you can buy new glasses.
600	00:33:08	00:33:09	Quit it, Roger. It's not our money.
601	00:33:09	00:33:11	The cops aren't gonna let us keep it.
602	00:33:11	00:33:12	We're not telling the cops, stupid.
603	00:33:12	00:33:13	We're not telling anybody.
604	00:33:13	00:33:15	I told you.
605	00:33:15	00:33:16	We have to. God, Scotty.
606	00:33:16	00:33:18	Stop being such a wuss!
607	00:33:18	00:33:20	I'm not being a wuss. I'm being smart.
608	00:33:20	00:33:22	I'm being... normal.
609	00:33:22	00:33:24	There's a dead guy back there.
610	00:33:24	00:33:27	I'm going home, and I'm calling the cops!
611	00:33:27	00:33:28	Scotty, I'm warning you.
612	00:33:28	00:33:29	Screw you.
613	00:33:29	00:33:31	You're not the boss of me.
614	00:33:34	00:33:36	I didn't mean to hurt him.
615	00:33:36	00:33:37	I just...
616	00:33:40	00:33:42	I just...
617	00:33:42	00:33:45	I just snapped.
618	00:33:45	00:33:51	Yeah, just those... those bags of cash-- it just seemed like all the money in the world.
619	00:33:53	00:33:55	I just didn't want nobody to take it.
620	00:33:55	00:33:57	So you killed your best friend.
621	00:33:57	00:34:00	No. I didn't kill him.
622	00:34:00	00:34:03	I mean, I hit him.
623	00:34:03	00:34:05	But he wasn't dead.
624	00:34:05	00:34:06	Oh, come on, Tyson.
625	00:34:06	00:34:08	He had a fractured skull.
626	00:34:08	00:34:10	Stop playing these games with me.
627	00:34:10	00:34:11	Tell me what happened out there.
628	00:34:13	00:34:16	Somebody... somebody else was out there that day.
629	00:34:17	00:34:18	We didn't know we'd been followed.
630	00:34:18	00:34:20	Hey, guys!
631	00:34:21	00:34:22	You guys better shut him up.
632	00:34:22	00:34:24	Someone's coming.
633	00:34:24	00:34:26	Damn it, Karen. Why do you always have to follow us?
634	00:34:26	00:34:28	Didn't you hear what I said? There's a car coming.
635	00:34:39	00:34:41	Shh.
636	00:34:47	00:34:48	Damn it!
637	00:34:57	00:34:57	No!
638	00:35:08	00:35:12	So you smothered him?
639	00:35:12	00:35:14	Look, I felt bad.
640	00:35:14	00:35:19	But in the moment, it was him or all of us.
641	00:35:21	00:35:26	So the three of you buried Scotty out in the desert along with that statue?
642	00:35:26	00:35:28	We were worried someone would find him.
643	00:35:28	00:35:32	But right away, the focus shifted to Lake Mead, so no one ever did.
644	00:35:32	00:35:34	What happened to all that money? The cash?
645	00:35:34	00:35:36	We hid it under the porch at Roger's house.
646	00:35:36	00:35:40	Couple of months later, his grandmother fell asleep on the couch with a cigarette in her hand.
647	00:35:40	00:35:42	Burned the house to the ground.
648	00:35:42	00:35:45	So Scotty died for nothing.
649	00:35:45	00:35:46	We were just kids.
650	00:35:46	00:35:48	Stupid kids.
651	00:35:48	00:35:52	Yeah, well, you're not a kid anymore, Karen.
652	00:35:52	00:35:54	Know what you are?
653	00:35:54	00:35:56	You're a liar.
654	00:35:56	00:35:59	I think you lied to us the last time you came in here.
655	00:35:59	00:36:03	I think that you and Roger found that stone lion the other night, the two of you.
656	00:36:03	00:36:05	You know what else I think?
657	00:36:05	00:36:08	I think when you got to the cars...
658	00:36:10	00:36:12	Something went wrong.
659	00:36:12	00:36:15	That wasn't the deal, Roger. You said we'd split it 50/50.
660	00:36:15	00:36:17	I said we'd split it; I didn't say how.
661	00:36:17	00:36:20	You didn't even know the statue was worth anything until I told you.
662	00:36:20	00:36:24	And you never would've found it without my father's photos.
663	00:36:24	00:36:26	I'll cut you in for a finder's fee.
664	00:36:28	00:36:30	Come on, Karen.
665	00:36:30	00:36:31	What are you gonna do?
666	00:36:32	00:36:35	You gonna kill me like you killed Scotty?
667	00:36:40	00:36:42	Not a bad theory.
668	00:36:42	00:36:47	Problem is, you don't have any evidence.
669	00:36:47	00:36:52	no evidence, no case.
670	00:36:52	00:36:56	There is no way that we can get her for Scotty Gates' murder.
671	00:36:56	00:36:59	She was 11 at the time, and we can't even conclude a cause of death.
672	00:36:59	00:37:01	We have to get her for killing Roger Mathers.
673	00:37:01	00:37:03	I know, but we don't have the evidence.
674	00:37:03	00:37:07	And by the time we do, she will have covered her tracks.
675	00:37:07	00:37:09	Sam? You looking for me?
676	00:37:13	00:37:18	When Karen was a teenager, she used to go down to the creek bed behind our house.
677	00:37:18	00:37:24	She had this little hiding place down there where she'd stash her cigarettes, thinking I-I didn't know.
678	00:37:25	00:37:28	I took a look down there tonight.
679	00:37:33	00:37:39	If this is what I think it is, your daughter can go to prison for a long time.
680	00:37:50	00:37:51	Nine millimeter.
681	00:37:51	00:37:53	Same caliber that killed Roger Mathers.
682	00:37:53	00:37:56	All for this.
683	00:37:56	00:38:01	You know, for years, I wondered if that thing really existed.
684	00:38:01	00:38:04	Now, more than ever, I wish it hadn't.
685	00:38:06	00:38:09	I thought I knew my little girl.
686	00:38:09	00:38:10	I thought we had no secrets.
687	00:38:12	00:38:15	For 25 years, she'd been hiding the truth from me.
688	00:38:18	00:38:20	I don't understand it.
689	00:38:20	00:38:21	I just...
690	00:38:21	00:38:23	I'm sorry. I really am.
691	00:38:23	00:38:25	You do everything you can for your kid.
692	00:38:25	00:38:28	You-you give them everything.
693	00:38:28	00:38:31	Everything.
694	00:38:31	00:38:34	Including the power to break your heart.
695	00:38:47	00:38:49	Captain, you wanted to know if there was news.
696	00:38:49	00:38:51	Yeah.
697	00:38:51	00:38:55	The swelling in Ellie's brain has subsided enough that we've reduced the medication.
698	00:38:55	00:38:56	She is responsive now.
699	00:38:56	00:38:57	She's awake? Yes.
700	00:38:57	00:38:59	But still in recovery.
701	00:38:59	00:39:01	I understand. Thank you, Doctor.
702	00:39:13	00:39:14	They told me you were hovering.
703	00:39:14	00:39:16	Yeah.
704	00:39:16	00:39:19	I just want to, uh, make sure that you were...
705	00:39:19	00:39:20	All right?
706	00:39:22	00:39:25	We both know that that's not really possible.
707	00:39:27	00:39:30	Why'd you even come?
708	00:39:30	00:39:32	I guess I'm...
709	00:39:32	00:39:35	just not ready to...
710	00:39:35	00:39:36	give up on you, Ellie.
711	00:39:39	00:39:42	This is not your fault.
712	00:39:42	00:39:45	There's always been something wrong with me.
713	00:39:45	00:39:48	No, that-that's not true.
714	00:39:48	00:39:51	You should just let me go.
715	00:39:51	00:39:53	I've tried.
716	00:39:53	00:39:55	Believe me.
717	00:39:56	00:40:00	But I can't.
718	00:40:00	00:40:02	I mean...
719	00:40:02	00:40:03	you're all I have left.
720	00:40:07	00:40:09	Look, I'm going to, uh...
721	00:40:09	00:40:11	I'm gonna let you rest, let you sleep, okay?
722	00:40:16	00:40:18	No. Stay.
723	00:40:20	00:40:22	Please, Dad?
724	00:40:29	00:40:30	Hey, Jim.
725	00:40:30	00:40:31	Hmm.
726	00:40:31	00:40:33	D.B., come in. Sit down.
727	00:40:39	00:40:41	I hear Ellie's out of the woods.
728	00:40:41	00:40:43	Yeah.
729	00:40:43	00:40:45	Two of you able to talk?
730	00:40:47	00:40:48	Yeah, we did.
731	00:40:48	00:40:50	For a while.
732	00:40:50	00:40:51	You all right?
733	00:40:51	00:40:53	I am, actually.
734	00:40:53	00:40:54	Can I buy you a drink?
735	00:40:54	00:40:56	Yeah.
736	00:41:01	00:41:03	Here you go.
737	00:41:03	00:41:04	Happy days.
738	00:41:04	00:41:06	Happy day.
739	00:41:06	00:41:10	You're a little calmer than I thought you might be.
740	00:41:10	00:41:11	You sure you're all right?
741	00:41:11	00:41:16	Yeah, I just had a four-hour conversation with my daughter.
742	00:41:16	00:41:19	That's something that hasn't happened to me in 15 years.
743	00:41:20	00:41:22	We realize that we need each other.
744	00:41:22	00:41:24	Even more now.
745	00:41:27	00:41:29	I-I would be a little...
746	00:41:29	00:41:31	little bit cautious if I were you.
747	00:41:31	00:41:33	Cautious? What do you mean?
748	00:41:33	00:41:35	You think she's trying to manipulate me-- is that it?
749	00:41:37	00:41:39	I love her, D.B.
750	00:41:39	00:41:41	I have to trust her.
751	00:41:41	00:41:44	She's all I got.
752	00:41:44	00:41:50	And I want to be there for her, I mean, really be there, help her out, the way any father would.
753	00:41:50	00:41:52	Good for you.
754	00:41:52	00:41:54	And I hope it works out. I really do.
755	00:41:54	00:41:56	Well, you and me both.
756	00:41:56	00:41:58	And with a little luck, who knows?
757	00:41:58	00:42:00	Okay.
758	00:42:00	00:42:02	I think I'm gonna hit the road.
759	00:42:02	00:42:04	Okay.
760	00:42:04	00:42:06	Yeah.
761	00:42:09	00:42:10	Want to walk out with me?
762	00:42:10	00:42:13	No, I think I'm gonna hang out here for a while.
763	00:42:13	00:42:16	I got to figure some things out.
764	00:42:16	00:42:18	Okay.
