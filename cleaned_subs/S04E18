0	00:01:02	00:01:03	Wow, that had to hurt.
1	00:01:09	00:01:11	Well, robbery wasn't a motive.
2	00:01:11	00:01:13	His eyes took the brunt of the punishment.
3	00:01:14	00:01:16	If you can't see, you can't fight back.
4	00:01:17	00:01:21	No. But he may have tried.
5	00:01:24	00:01:25	Tony Sciarra.
6	00:01:25	00:01:27	From Philadelphia.
7	00:01:27	00:01:39	So much for brotherly love.
8	00:02:20	00:02:23	Our victim Tony just checked into the hotel.
9	00:02:23	00:02:24	He hadn't even unpacked.
10	00:02:24	00:02:26	He made enemies fast.
11	00:02:26	00:02:29	Yeah, old man at the casino, who he knocked down, said the same thing.
12	00:02:29	00:02:32	He was hauling ass.
13	00:02:32	00:02:33	Why?
14	00:02:43	00:02:45	Blood drops are medium to large.
15	00:02:46	00:02:49	Low-velocity spatter. No castoff.
16	00:02:49	00:02:52	Maybe he wasn't beaten with a weapon.
17	00:02:52	00:02:54	Hand to hand?
18	00:02:55	00:03:00	I know this guy's yoked. He's what? 6'2? 6'3?
19	00:03:00	00:03:02	Size doesn't matter when you're outnumbered.
20	00:03:09	00:03:11	Damn.
21	00:03:16	00:03:17	Here's our vic.
22	00:03:17	00:03:18	Leaving the floor.
23	00:03:18	00:03:21	And the cameras. No eyes in the corridors or the rest rooms.
24	00:03:21	00:03:23	Yeah, well, we know where he went.
25	00:03:23	00:03:24	Just show us where he came from, please.
26	00:03:37	00:03:38	Whoa. Whoa.
27	00:03:38	00:03:39	That's good.
28	00:03:39	00:03:40	Start it from right there.
29	00:03:46	00:03:48	Did you see that?
30	00:03:48	00:03:52	Yeah, the little guy on the right just snaked him.
31	00:03:53	00:03:54	You've got to be kidding me.
32	00:03:54	00:03:55	He just did it again.
33	00:03:55	00:03:57	Two for two.
34	00:03:57	00:04:01	That guy has got stones going after a mark as big as Tony.
35	00:04:01	00:04:03	He knows he has backup.
36	00:04:03	00:04:06	Is the third time a charm?
37	00:04:06	00:04:07	Yes, it is.
38	00:04:09	00:04:10	Busted.
39	00:04:11	00:04:13	Accusations from Tony.
40	00:04:13	00:04:16	He's getting hot.
41	00:04:16	00:04:17	Some kind of denial from the little guy.
42	00:04:18	00:04:20	Tony got worked. Just wanted his money back.
43	00:04:20	00:04:22	We're going to need a still of the little guy's face, if you could.
44	00:04:22	00:04:25	You got it.
45	00:04:27	00:04:32	Fractures to the zygomatic, ethmoidal, nasal bones.
46	00:04:32	00:04:35	Also the maxilla and mandible.
47	00:04:35	00:04:37	How many teeth did you find at the scene? Two.
48	00:04:39	00:04:41	He's missing six.
49	00:04:41	00:04:43	I found one in the back of his mouth.
50	00:04:43	00:04:45	He probably swallowed the other three.
51	00:04:46	00:04:48	I'll check his stomach.
52	00:04:48	00:04:52	Blood evidence at the scene suggests that his attackers did not use a weapon.
53	00:04:54	00:04:55	Contusions are nondescript.
54	00:04:55	00:04:57	No foreign tool marks.
55	00:04:58	00:05:00	Bare knuckles?
56	00:05:00	00:05:01	That's what I'm thinking.
57	00:05:01	00:05:06	Multiple blows to the head produced angular acceleration and deceleration in the brain.
58	00:05:09	00:05:13	Twisting of the brain causes the bridging veins to rip.
59	00:05:13	00:05:15	From there it's all downhill.
60	00:05:15	00:05:18	The axons within the white matter of the brain begin to snap.
61	00:05:19	00:05:22	Officially, COD is diffuse axonal injury.
62	00:05:22	00:05:23	Unofficially...
63	00:05:25	00:05:28	it's the most brutal beating I've ever seen.
64	00:05:28	00:05:33	Neck bruises were made by a left hand?
65	00:05:34	00:05:36	What about these bruises?
66	00:05:36	00:05:40	Well, there's no defensive wounds on the hands or forearm.
67	00:05:40	00:05:42	So I'm guessing it was restrained.
68	00:05:42	00:05:46	Bruises could be somebody's knees on his chest.
69	00:05:46	00:05:54	So a hand on his throat, knees on his chest, his head was butted up against a wall, and all the blows were directed at his face.
70	00:05:54	00:05:57	That doesn't leave much room for any other attackers to get their licks in.
71	00:05:57	00:05:59	Maybe there were no other attackers.
72	00:06:03	00:06:05	One guy did all this?
73	00:06:10	00:06:12	So you're sure this was the man you saw?
74	00:06:12	00:06:16	Yes. I was in the bathroom.
75	00:06:24	00:06:27	I waited for him to leave. Then I called security.
76	00:06:27	00:06:29	Do you see this man now?
77	00:06:30	00:06:32	All you have to do is nod.
78	00:06:39	00:06:40	Thanks.
79	00:06:43	00:06:46	ID's off. We're looking for a blue shirt and jeans.
80	00:06:46	00:06:48	He could have ditched the clothes.
81	00:06:48	00:06:49	Let's be smart about this.
82	00:07:08	00:07:10	Las Vegas Police.
83	00:07:10	00:07:13	Put your hands behind your head and stand up.
84	00:07:13	00:07:15	Come on.
85	00:07:51	00:07:55	You're not much of a talker, are you, Walter?
86	00:08:00	00:08:02	I'll tell you.
87	00:08:05	00:08:08	You must be a pretty tough guy to take on Tony.
88	00:08:08	00:08:12	A guy as big as that? He's huge.
89	00:08:12	00:08:14	That's his name, you know?
90	00:08:14	00:08:16	Tony Sciarro from Philadelphia.
91	00:08:16	00:08:19	Did you know Tony?
92	00:08:20	00:08:26	How come you left his wallet and $500 in chips in his pocket, huh?
93	00:08:26	00:08:30	That makes me think that this was about something else.
94	00:08:30	00:08:32	Did he...
95	00:08:32	00:08:35	wrong you in some way?
96	00:08:35	00:08:37	He hurt you?
97	00:08:37	00:08:40	Huh?
98	00:08:45	00:08:47	Maybe it was just a...
99	00:08:47	00:08:49	lover's quarrel.
100	00:08:51	00:08:53	I'm not soft.
101	00:08:53	00:08:58	That's okay. This is Vegas.
102	00:08:58	00:09:02	But that's not what we saw on the video.
103	00:09:02	00:09:04	You're at the crap table.
104	00:09:04	00:09:06	You swiped his chips.
105	00:09:06	00:09:09	And then you whispered sweet nothings in his ear.
106	00:09:11	00:09:13	What did you say?
107	00:09:13	00:09:15	Give me a reason.
108	00:09:15	00:09:17	That a confession?
109	00:09:17	00:09:18	No.
110	00:09:18	00:09:20	That's what I said.
111	00:09:21	00:09:23	That stare doesn't work on me.
112	00:09:23	00:09:25	But save it.
113	00:09:25	00:09:27	Because they're going to love you in prison.
114	00:09:29	00:09:32	Mr. Darien, may I see your fingers?
115	00:09:32	00:09:34	Why?
116	00:09:34	00:09:39	Well, because you may have evidence underneath the fingernails, and I'd like to collect it.
117	00:09:58	00:10:01	Mr. Darien, do you have a fever?
118	00:11:10	00:11:13	You might want to double-check that.
119	00:11:13	00:11:15	I did.
120	00:11:28	00:11:29	It's not as bad as it looks.
121	00:11:29	00:11:32	It never looks too good when a suspects dies in custody.
122	00:11:32	00:11:34	What are you saying, Rory?
123	00:11:34	00:11:36	You'd rather it be one of us?
124	00:11:36	00:11:38	No, that's not what I'm saying.
125	00:11:38	00:11:41	If I was here, I'd have been in there with you, you know that.
126	00:11:41	00:11:45	I assume we're going to come out looking like the bad guy again.
127	00:11:45	00:11:48	Yeah.
128	00:11:50	00:11:51	You okay?
129	00:11:51	00:11:53	I'm fine.
130	00:11:55	00:11:56	Nasty.
131	00:11:56	00:11:58	That kind of looks like a hickey.
132	00:12:00	00:12:02	You want to tell me what got this party started?
133	00:12:03	00:12:05	I scraped his nails.
134	00:12:05	00:12:07	That's it?
135	00:12:07	00:12:08	What was his liver temp?
136	00:12:08	00:12:10	101.5.
137	00:12:10	00:12:12	He's been dead an hour.
138	00:12:12	00:12:16	That means his body temperature was 103.
139	00:12:16	00:12:18	I touched his skin, Catherine.
140	00:12:18	00:12:20	He felt like he was on fire.
141	00:12:32	00:12:35	How did Walter Darien even drive this thing?
142	00:12:35	00:12:38	Where there's a will, there's a way.
143	00:12:38	00:12:42	PD found it in the Orpheus parking lot.
144	00:12:44	00:12:49	Blue shirt and jeans right on top.
145	00:12:50	00:12:52	He didn't even try to hide them.
146	00:13:04	00:13:06	Positive for blood.
147	00:13:07	00:13:08	I'll get it to Greg.
148	00:13:08	00:13:20	So this scumbag, Walter Darien, he beats a guy to death, goes out to his car, changes clothes and then goes back into the casino, washes his hands and just gets something to eat.
149	00:13:20	00:13:23	Just another day.
150	00:13:23	00:13:24	Wow.
151	00:13:29	00:13:30	Whoa...
152	00:13:30	00:13:31	Yahtzee.
153	00:13:34	00:13:36	Whoa.
154	00:13:36	00:13:38	Must be a few thousand dollars' worth of chips here.
155	00:13:40	00:13:44	So, he grifts, but doesn't cash in?
156	00:13:44	00:13:47	Maybe it wasn't about the money.
157	00:13:48	00:13:53	I got gloves, a T-shirt and a jacket all with the tags still on them.
158	00:13:53	00:13:56	Maybe he just likes to steal things.
159	00:14:07	00:14:09	Road Side Diner, Libby.
160	00:14:09	00:14:11	Sara.
161	00:14:21	00:14:23	What does that look like to you?
162	00:14:24	00:14:26	Burn holes.
163	00:14:26	00:14:31	The guy takes on five cops in their house.
164	00:14:31	00:14:33	Makes you wonder what he might have done to a waitress.
165	00:14:40	00:14:43	Didn't get enough of this guy in the interrogation room?
166	00:14:43	00:14:44	I have a question.
167	00:14:44	00:14:46	Yes?
168	00:14:46	00:14:47	Cause of death?
169	00:14:47	00:14:50	Well, it wasn't the nightstick action.
170	00:14:51	00:14:53	Cardiac arrhythmia.
171	00:14:53	00:14:56	His heart rate increased till he went into tachycardia.
172	00:14:56	00:14:58	Started throwing PVCs and then V-fib.
173	00:14:58	00:15:00	Prior condition?
174	00:15:00	00:15:02	Nothing I could find.
175	00:15:02	00:15:06	The guy had a big heart-- 550 grams-- but otherwise healthy.
176	00:15:06	00:15:09	This guy was pumped up before the fight.
177	00:15:09	00:15:11	White knuckles, veins popping.
178	00:15:11	00:15:17	Well, he could have been on something-- tox is pending-- but there were no observable effects of long-term drug abuse.
179	00:15:17	00:15:21	No atrophy, cirrhosis, tissue necrosis.
180	00:15:21	00:15:23	I checked all the hot spots.
181	00:15:23	00:15:26	He had a temperature of 103 when he died.
182	00:15:26	00:15:29	Any pathology to explain that?
183	00:15:29	00:15:33	The organs showed no sign of infection or disease.
184	00:15:33	00:15:36	So there was nothing wrong with this guy.
185	00:15:36	00:15:41	Well, I'll send a tissue sample to histology, but 98.6 is just an average.
186	00:15:41	00:15:43	Some people run hot.
187	00:15:43	00:15:47	See, during questioning, your brother became a little...
188	00:15:47	00:15:49	unruly, and, uh...
189	00:15:49	00:15:53	so for their own safety, the officers had no choice but to use force.
190	00:15:53	00:15:55	At which point...
191	00:15:55	00:15:57	I've heard enough.
192	00:15:57	00:16:01	Ms. Darien, it's very important that you understand the situation here.
193	00:16:01	00:16:03	I do.
194	00:16:03	00:16:05	Walter was killed in police custody.
195	00:16:08	00:16:12	Uh, let me introduce Gil Grissom from the crime lab.
196	00:16:12	00:16:15	This is Beth Darien, the...
197	00:16:15	00:16:18	I was in the room with your brother.
198	00:16:19	00:16:21	Was that how he touched your life?
199	00:16:23	00:16:30	The autopsy concluded that your brother's death was not the result of the officers' use of force.
200	00:16:30	00:16:32	I don't care how he died.
201	00:16:34	00:16:36	I'm just relieved that it's over.
202	00:16:39	00:16:42	Walter hurt a lot of people.
203	00:16:42	00:16:45	If you had something he wanted, he just took it.
204	00:16:45	00:16:47	And if you got in his way...
205	00:16:50	00:16:51	I always kept my distance.
206	00:16:54	00:16:58	Ms. Darien, your brother's body temperature was...
207	00:16:58	00:16:59	Hot to the touch?
208	00:16:59	00:17:02	He was always that way, ever since we were kids.
209	00:17:02	00:17:06	I'll have someone from the department contact you, all right, Ms. Darien?
210	00:17:06	00:17:09	Always knew that Walter would end up in jail or dead.
211	00:17:12	00:17:14	I'm sorry.
212	00:17:31	00:17:34	Griss, what are you hoping to find here?
213	00:17:34	00:17:36	Walter Darien lived here.
214	00:17:36	00:17:38	He owned the place.
215	00:17:38	00:17:39	Well, Greg ran the DNA.
216	00:17:39	00:17:42	The blood on Walter's clothes is a match to Tony.
217	00:17:42	00:17:45	The hair in Tony's hands is a match to Walter's.
218	00:17:45	00:17:46	This case is closed, isn't it?
219	00:17:46	00:17:48	That case is closed.
220	00:17:48	00:17:49	We can't prosecute a dead man.
221	00:17:49	00:17:53	The evil men do lives after them.
222	00:17:53	00:17:57	The good is oft interred with their bones.
223	00:17:57	00:17:58	Shakespeare?
224	00:17:58	00:17:59	Julius Caesar.
225	00:18:12	00:18:13	Whew.
226	00:18:14	00:18:17	This guy never threw anything away.
227	00:18:17	00:18:18	So, what do you think?
228	00:18:18	00:18:20	Obsessive compulsive disorder?
229	00:18:21	00:18:22	Well...
230	00:18:22	00:18:33	if Walter viewed his world as a threatening place, according to the shrinks, the hoarding of useless objects may have made him feel safe and secure.
231	00:18:34	00:18:37	Yeah, well, in the real world, Walter's the threat.
232	00:18:41	00:18:43	Guess he didn't like what he saw.
233	00:19:17	00:19:19	Hey, Grissom.
234	00:19:21	00:19:23	This doesn't look like a patio.
235	00:19:31	00:19:34	Libby... Libby...
236	00:19:34	00:19:37	Oh, yeah, dish girl.
237	00:19:37	00:19:38	She have a last name?
238	00:19:39	00:19:40	Sure, she does, but I don't know it.
239	00:19:40	00:19:42	When's the last time you saw her?
240	00:19:42	00:19:43	Eight years ago.
241	00:19:43	00:19:45	The kid had no chops.
242	00:19:46	00:19:47	Ouch!
243	00:19:47	00:19:48	Burned herself real good.
244	00:19:49	00:19:51	That was her first and last day.
245	00:19:51	00:19:52	We need an ID.
246	00:19:52	00:19:56	Is there any chance you still have a W2 lying around or a copy of her driver's license?
247	00:19:56	00:20:00	Girl wasn't here long enough to refill the coffee pot, let alone sign anything.
248	00:20:00	00:20:03	I don't know where she came from, don't know where she went.
249	00:20:03	00:20:04	What about this guy?
250	00:20:05	00:20:06	You ever see him with Libby?
251	00:20:06	00:20:08	I ain't gettin' nothin'.
252	00:20:09	00:20:11	Sorry. Order's up.
253	00:21:37	00:21:39	Only one thing makes that sound.
254	00:22:22	00:22:23	Well...
255	00:22:25	00:22:28	I guess there was no more room at the inn.
256	00:22:55	00:22:57	It's a wedding band.
257	00:22:57	00:23:00	You think this is the waitress Nick and Sara are looking for?
258	00:23:00	00:23:01	Well, there's no clothing left.
259	00:23:01	00:23:03	The wedding band could be either/or.
260	00:23:03	00:23:04	There's nothing gender-specific yet.
261	00:23:05	00:23:07	Next to no tissue.
262	00:23:07	00:23:09	No hairs at all.
263	00:23:09	00:23:12	To get the bones, what do you think, Grissom?
264	00:23:12	00:23:14	Been down here at least three years?
265	00:23:16	00:23:19	No, it's probably more than three years.
266	00:23:19	00:23:21	You're kidding me, right?
267	00:23:21	00:23:25	Well, the rule of thumb is if the skull smells bad, it's usually under three years.
268	00:23:25	00:23:27	This one smells like dirt.
269	00:23:27	00:23:29	There's something under the pelvic bone.
270	00:23:31	00:23:32	Oh, yeah.
271	00:23:35	00:23:37	Possible murder weapon.
272	00:23:39	00:23:43	You think we could still get any DNA off of it?
273	00:23:43	00:23:46	Any blood's been exposed to the elements longer than the inside of these bones.
274	00:23:46	00:23:49	There's no skin, clothing or tissue to protect it.
275	00:23:49	00:23:50	Doesn't fit.
276	00:23:50	00:23:51	Walter was a fighter.
277	00:23:51	00:23:53	Used his fists, not knives, you know?
278	00:23:55	00:23:57	Well, we haven't known him that long.
279	00:23:58	00:24:01	Forehead's upright, smooth.
280	00:24:01	00:24:05	Mandible's small. Lower face narrow.
281	00:24:05	00:24:07	Female traits. Yeah.
282	00:24:07	00:24:08	Pelvis confirms it.
283	00:24:08	00:24:10	It's wide for the birth canal.
284	00:24:10	00:24:13	No pits in the pubic bone-- she never gave birth.
285	00:24:13	00:24:14	What about her race?
286	00:24:14	00:24:17	Zygomatic bones retreat, slant back.
287	00:24:18	00:24:20	Nasal opening's long and narrow.
288	00:24:20	00:24:22	Caucasian. Mm.
289	00:24:22	00:24:23	Around 5'4.
290	00:24:23	00:24:27	I estimated her height from the length of the femur.
291	00:24:27	00:24:29	How old are we talking?
292	00:24:29	00:24:31	Well... third molars haven't erupted.
293	00:24:33	00:24:35	No wisdom teeth.
294	00:24:35	00:24:38	So that would put her in her late teens, early 20s.
295	00:24:38	00:24:40	Eh, it's a safe estimate.
296	00:24:41	00:24:44	Cause of death?
297	00:24:44	00:24:47	Strangulation. Fracture to the hyoid bone.
298	00:24:47	00:24:49	What about these right here?
299	00:24:49	00:24:53	Fractures to the zygomatic bone and maxilla...
300	00:24:53	00:24:55	also the left ulna...
301	00:24:55	00:24:59	but no tool marks on any of the bones.
302	00:24:59	00:25:04	So maybe she was punched in the face and tried to shield herself?
303	00:25:04	00:25:09	Yeah. Walter Darien strangled a female Caucasian, 5'4, around 20 years old.
304	00:25:09	00:25:12	Yeah, but is it our missing waitress?
305	00:25:12	00:25:14	Well, I, uh, did dental charts, x-rays.
306	00:25:14	00:25:16	David's off and running with 'em now.
307	00:25:16	00:25:23	I also excised a portion of the femur, scraped a tissue sample from inside the pelvis, and yanked a molar.
308	00:25:23	00:25:26	If there's any usable DNA left, that's where it'll be.
309	00:25:26	00:25:28	Okay.
310	00:25:32	00:25:35	How'd you know there was another body at that motel?
311	00:25:35	00:25:37	I didn't.
312	00:25:38	00:25:42	Tox and histology results came back on Walter Darien.
313	00:25:42	00:25:44	Negative across the board.
314	00:25:44	00:25:46	No drugs, no diseases.
315	00:25:46	00:25:48	I don't get it.
316	00:25:48	00:25:52	The guy was 38 years old, and this was his first arrest.
317	00:25:52	00:25:54	And you're wondering what he'd been doing all his life.
318	00:25:57	00:25:59	Willows.
319	00:26:03	00:26:07	Why don't you hold that thought until later?
320	00:26:09	00:26:11	Sorry.
321	00:26:12	00:26:13	A new friend.
322	00:26:14	00:26:16	Congratulations.
323	00:26:16	00:26:19	Got time for something a little weird?
324	00:26:21	00:26:23	I recovered DNA from your Jane Doe skeleton.
325	00:26:23	00:26:26	Clean samples from the molar and femur...
326	00:26:26	00:26:27	but no hits in CODIS.
327	00:26:28	00:26:29	So Jane Doe was never reported missing.
328	00:26:29	00:26:33	Apparently not. I also pulled DNA from the pelvic sample.
329	00:26:33	00:26:36	foreign DNA from a male.
330	00:26:36	00:26:38	Walter Darien.
331	00:26:38	00:26:41	No. That's where it gets weird.
332	00:26:41	00:26:43	The foreign DNA was homozygous.
333	00:26:43	00:26:46	Hit all 13 loci.
334	00:26:47	00:26:52	One peep per marker. Shared alleles, so it was either a father or a son.
335	00:26:52	00:26:54	According to the autopsy, she never gave birth.
336	00:26:54	00:26:56	So it was a father.
337	00:26:56	00:26:58	Okay, so how'd it get there?
338	00:26:58	00:27:06	The tissue was from inside the pelvis, so even if Daddy's blood or semen got on her clothes or skin, it never would've survived being in the ground all that time.
339	00:27:06	00:27:12	So there has to be an additional biological source, 'cause there was no one else in that grave.
340	00:27:12	00:27:14	That's all I got.
341	00:27:14	00:27:18	No name, no tissue, no hair.
342	00:27:18	00:27:19	I like a challenge.
343	00:27:19	00:27:24	Pull up the standard tissue thickness scale for female American Caucasoids.
344	00:27:25	00:27:27	Use the normal figures.
345	00:27:30	00:27:32	Apply the midline measurements.
346	00:27:35	00:27:37	Good. Now the bilateral.
347	00:27:40	00:27:42	That's the blueprint.
348	00:27:42	00:27:43	Mm-hmm.
349	00:28:08	00:28:10	Okay, you can take this.
350	00:29:43	00:29:44	Long skull.
351	00:29:44	00:29:47	Prominent nose and chin.
352	00:29:47	00:29:50	Maybe Nordic descent.
353	00:29:50	00:29:55	That means... light complexion, hair...
354	00:29:56	00:29:59	...and... blue-green eyes.
355	00:30:44	00:30:46	Warrick.
356	00:30:50	00:30:52	These have got to be maternity clothes.
357	00:31:00	00:31:02	And baby makes three.
358	00:31:07	00:31:10	Her name's not Libby.
359	00:31:10	00:31:14	Dental records confirm our Jane Doe was Marissa Cleary.
360	00:31:14	00:31:18	Which leaves our missing waitress Libby still unaccounted for.
361	00:31:18	00:31:21	The foreign DNA in her pelvis wasn't from her father.
362	00:31:21	00:31:23	It was from her son.
363	00:31:23	00:31:28	There was no evidence of a fetus or a baby in that grave.
364	00:31:28	00:31:29	She never gave birth.
365	00:31:29	00:31:31	Not through her birth canal.
366	00:31:31	00:31:34	There's other ways to deliver a baby.
367	00:31:34	00:31:37	Well, that might explain the hunting knife we found.
368	00:31:45	00:31:49	The umbilical cord contains fetal DNA.
369	00:31:53	00:31:57	Walter Darien never threw anything out...
370	00:31:58	00:32:01	so where'd the baby go?
371	00:32:03	00:32:04	Eight years.
372	00:32:05	00:32:06	I never thought she was dead.
373	00:32:06	00:32:10	I wondered where she was, what she was doing with her life.
374	00:32:10	00:32:12	What my kid was like.
375	00:32:15	00:32:19	Mr. Cleary, we haven't found any evidence to suggest that your son...
376	00:32:19	00:32:21	My son?
377	00:32:21	00:32:23	You mean it was a boy?
378	00:32:23	00:32:24	Yes.
379	00:32:25	00:32:26	Well, can I see him?
380	00:32:28	00:32:31	Is he dead, too?
381	00:32:31	00:32:33	We don't know.
382	00:32:39	00:32:46	Marissa and I had only been seeing each other for a few months, and everything was great.
383	00:32:46	00:32:49	And then she got pregnant, so we got married.
384	00:32:49	00:32:53	And all of a sudden, she hates me, I hate her.
385	00:32:53	00:32:54	All we did was fight.
386	00:32:54	00:32:58	Then she calls me one night at work.
387	00:32:58	00:33:00	You don't want me in your life, fine.
388	00:33:00	00:33:02	I'm gone!
389	00:33:02	00:33:05	Good! It's the best news I've heard all year.
390	00:33:10	00:33:13	That was the last time we spoke.
391	00:33:13	00:33:16	And you never reported her missing?
392	00:33:16	00:33:18	I didn't think she was.
393	00:33:22	00:33:23	I was 19.
394	00:33:23	00:33:25	Barely out of high school.
395	00:33:25	00:33:27	Last thing you needed was a family.
396	00:33:27	00:33:32	She was in her ninth month when she split.
397	00:33:32	00:33:37	I thought she'd cool off in a couple of days, come back, we would work things out.
398	00:33:37	00:33:40	But then I got this.
399	00:33:50	00:33:54	You're not who I thought you were.
400	00:33:54	00:33:57	You don't want me.
401	00:33:57	00:33:59	You don't want this baby.
402	00:33:59	00:34:01	We don't want you.
403	00:34:01	00:34:03	Marissa.
404	00:34:49	00:34:56	All right, you see the long legs she gives to her M, and how it stands alone?
405	00:34:56	00:34:57	Mm-hmm.
406	00:34:57	00:34:59	Now look at the Dear John letter.
407	00:34:59	00:35:02	This is not Marissa's signature...
408	00:35:02	00:35:04	just a quick and dirty forgery.
409	00:35:04	00:35:05	My money's on Walter.
410	00:35:05	00:35:08	Well, I can't tell you anything without an exemplar.
411	00:35:08	00:35:11	Yeah, well, Warrick's going through his stuff now.
412	00:35:11	00:35:13	From what I hear, that's going to take a while.
413	00:35:13	00:35:15	So, what about this text?
414	00:35:15	00:35:23	Uh, not typed-- printed uh, off an inkjet, and so far, all of Walter's accumulated printers are dot matrix.
415	00:35:23	00:35:24	No match.
416	00:36:11	00:36:15	Warrick found a baseball cap in Walter's motel.
417	00:36:15	00:36:16	Yielded a blond hair.
418	00:36:16	00:36:21	DNA was still good, which means the hair was no more than a few years old.
419	00:36:21	00:36:23	It was Marissa's son.
420	00:36:24	00:36:26	So, he'd be eight now.
421	00:36:27	00:36:29	Assuming he's still alive.
422	00:36:29	00:36:32	Hey, guys, I've been working on that John Doe envelope.
423	00:36:32	00:36:34	The postmark was Henderson.
424	00:36:34	00:36:35	The Bates Motel is in Sloan.
425	00:36:35	00:36:38	Why would Walter go that far out of his way to mail a letter?
426	00:36:38	00:36:41	He wouldn't.
427	00:36:41	00:36:44	Well, I moved to Henderson to get away from Walter.
428	00:36:44	00:36:48	I stayed out of his life, hoping he'd stay out of mine.
429	00:36:50	00:36:51	Didn't matter that I was his sister.
430	00:36:51	00:36:54	He treated me like he did everybody else.
431	00:36:58	00:37:00	Do you recognize this woman?
432	00:37:00	00:37:02	No.
433	00:37:02	00:37:03	Who is she?
434	00:37:03	00:37:05	Her name is Marissa Cleary.
435	00:37:05	00:37:10	We believe she was a guest in your brother's motel eight years ago.
436	00:37:11	00:37:13	He killed her, didn't he?
437	00:37:13	00:37:15	We think so.
438	00:37:15	00:37:17	Oh, I wonder what she did to set him off.
439	00:37:17	00:37:18	I don't know.
440	00:37:18	00:37:21	I'm sure it wasn't much.
441	00:37:21	00:37:23	You don't want me in your life.
442	00:37:24	00:37:25	Fine.
443	00:37:25	00:37:26	I'm gone!
444	00:37:26	00:37:29	Good! It's the best news I've heard all year.
445	00:37:36	00:37:38	Shut up!
446	00:37:38	00:37:41	Shut up. Damn it!
447	00:37:47	00:37:52	He could always find an excuse for anything that he did.
448	00:37:55	00:37:57	Are we keeping you from something?
449	00:37:57	00:37:58	No.
450	00:37:58	00:38:01	It makes me really uncomfortable talking about Walter.
451	00:38:06	00:38:09	Did Walter give you those burns?
452	00:38:13	00:38:20	No, that was, uh... an accident on the job many, many years ago.
453	00:38:20	00:38:22	When you used to be a waitress, Libby?
454	00:38:25	00:38:27	Nobody's called me that in years.
455	00:38:27	00:38:28	How did you know?
456	00:38:28	00:38:31	We found your old waitress uniform in Walter's car.
457	00:38:31	00:38:34	I, I had that job for one day.
458	00:38:34	00:38:36	I was a lousy waitress.
459	00:38:36	00:38:38	Why would he keep that?
460	00:39:00	00:39:03	Hi, Mom.
461	00:39:03	00:39:05	Hey, baby.
462	00:39:09	00:39:11	Why don't you take your stuff and put it in your room?
463	00:39:11	00:39:13	I'll make you a snack.
464	00:39:25	00:39:26	How old is that little guy?
465	00:39:26	00:39:29	He's going to be nine next month.
466	00:39:51	00:39:53	You're not his mother.
467	00:39:53	00:39:55	I'm the only mother he's ever known.
468	00:39:55	00:39:59	I raised him; I had to.
469	00:40:13	00:40:18	Middle of the night, your brother shows up and hands you a baby.
470	00:40:18	00:40:19	You don't ask any questions.
471	00:40:19	00:40:21	You don't report it.
472	00:40:21	00:40:26	Walter said that the mother was a runaway, and that she didn't want the baby.
473	00:40:26	00:40:29	I took him in.
474	00:40:29	00:40:31	I love him.
475	00:40:31	00:40:34	How did Martin get the scar on his forehead?
476	00:40:34	00:40:36	I don't know.
477	00:40:36	00:40:40	I think you didn't want to know.
478	00:40:48	00:40:52	Marissa Cleary didn't sign that note.
479	00:40:54	00:40:57	And we don't think Walter wrote it, either.
480	00:40:57	00:41:01	I'm not like Walter.
481	00:41:01	00:41:07	When I opened the suitcase, and I saw the photograph...
482	00:41:07	00:41:10	I didn't want the father to suffer.
483	00:41:15	00:41:19	The suitcase was in Walter's closet.
484	00:41:19	00:41:20	I took it back.
485	00:41:20	00:41:23	I didn't want it around me.
486	00:41:23	00:41:26	I knew that he would never notice.
487	00:41:32	00:41:35	Giving me Martin...
488	00:41:35	00:41:39	was the only good thing that Walter ever did.
489	00:41:39	00:41:42	I don't know why he did it.
490	00:41:42	00:41:46	But it wasn't out of the goodness of his heart.
