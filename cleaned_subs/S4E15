0,00:00:17,00:00:18,Ready to go?
1,00:00:18,00:00:19,I'll get the paper. You get the car.
2,00:00:19,00:00:20,Okay.
3,00:00:41,00:00:42,(zapping)
4,00:00:42,00:00:43,Ooh!
5,00:00:43,00:00:45,(screams)
6,00:00:55,00:00:59,"Early morning call-out, the worst."
7,00:00:59,00:01:00,Where did you come from?
8,00:01:00,00:01:01,Home.
9,00:01:01,00:01:03,Did you get any sleep?
10,00:01:03,00:01:04,No. You?
11,00:01:04,00:01:05,About a half an hour.
12,00:01:05,00:01:07,I was watching theWorld Series of Poker.
13,00:01:07,00:01:10,Waiting for Sam Farha to light his cigarette.
14,00:01:10,00:01:12,Ever been to the Acid Drop?
15,00:01:12,00:01:15,I try to avoid those places.
16,00:01:15,00:01:17,The victims were the owners.
17,00:01:17,00:01:20,Mike Trent and his wife Laurel.
18,00:01:20,00:01:23,Both shot execution-style back of the head.
19,00:01:23,00:01:25,A neighbor walking the dog found 'em.
20,00:01:25,00:01:29,Mike used to own a semi-pro hockey team with some other guy.
21,00:01:29,00:01:34,"He made a ton of money, sunk it all into clubs like Acid Drop, uh, Psychedelic Hoe-Down..."
22,00:01:34,00:01:35,Captain Brass.
23,00:01:35,00:01:37,Fun joints.
24,00:01:37,00:01:40,Looks like they never got out of the driveway.
25,00:01:40,00:01:41,(gasps)
26,00:01:41,00:01:43,(gunshots)
27,00:01:43,00:01:49,"She dropped where she was shot, but he looks like he was dragged."
28,00:01:52,00:01:58,"You drag a body away to hide it, not down a driveway for the world to see it."
29,00:01:59,00:02:09,Unless that was the point.
30,00:02:45,00:02:47,BROWN: Bling-bling.
31,00:02:47,00:02:49,The ol' trophy wife.
32,00:02:49,00:02:51,You think?
33,00:02:51,00:02:54,Classic Vegas.
34,00:02:54,00:03:01,"He pays for her boobs, tummy tuck, Prada, weekly spa, French manicure."
35,00:03:01,00:03:06,And she's just hanging on his arm like she belongs.
36,00:03:06,00:03:08,"Tell us how you really feel, Catherine."
37,00:03:08,00:03:09,"Oh, it's gross."
38,00:03:09,00:03:11,I wouldn't want to be her for the world.
39,00:03:11,00:03:14,"I wouldn't mind being her for a day, I guess."
40,00:03:14,00:03:15,Not this day.
41,00:03:15,00:03:16,No.
42,00:03:16,00:03:19,Looks like it was just the two of them.
43,00:03:19,00:03:21,Nobody I know lives like this with kids.
44,00:03:21,00:03:23,(phone rings)
45,00:03:24,00:03:26,Brown.
46,00:03:26,00:03:28,I've been here for 20 minutes.
47,00:03:28,00:03:29,What's the code?
48,00:03:29,00:03:31,You on the East Coast looking for a sunset?
49,00:03:31,00:03:33,I am.
50,00:03:33,00:03:34,You're at the wrong gate.
51,00:03:34,00:03:37,"Drive back down the road, make three lefts."
52,00:03:37,00:03:42,"When you get to the main gate, speak to Officer Ray and tell her you're with the Crime Lab."
53,00:03:42,00:03:45,"When you get to the scene, make sure I'm the first person you speak to."
54,00:03:45,00:03:46,Okay.
55,00:03:51,00:03:51,Mike Trent?
56,00:03:52,00:03:53,Mm-hmm.
57,00:03:53,00:03:56,"Boy, he's a big dog in the club world."
58,00:03:56,00:04:01,"You know I heard he paid Lil' Kim $10,000 one time just to walk into one of his clubs, turn around and walk back out."
59,00:04:01,00:04:04,"Yeah, Jah Rule gets the same fee."
60,00:04:04,00:04:08,He told me.
61,00:04:08,00:04:10,"Hey, uh, let me have one of those, Sara."
62,00:04:10,00:04:12,"Sorry, last one."
63,00:04:13,00:04:15,"You have a cold, Sara?"
64,00:04:15,00:04:17,I've been feeling a little run-down lately.
65,00:04:17,00:04:19,"Okay, it's a gated community."
66,00:04:19,00:04:21,The main gate has a guard all the time.
67,00:04:21,00:04:25,"The resident gate is at the north end, has punch-key access."
68,00:04:25,00:04:28,Those are the only two ways in and out of this place.
69,00:04:28,00:04:31,I thought you moved into communities like this for this not to happen.
70,00:04:32,00:04:35,"STOKES: Hey, Grissom."
71,00:04:35,00:04:36,What do you got?
72,00:04:36,00:04:39,"So far, an empty briefcase and a purse."
73,00:04:39,00:04:41,You want us to take the perimeter?
74,00:04:41,00:04:42,"Yeah, please."
75,00:04:42,00:04:44,Catherine and Warwick are inside.
76,00:04:44,00:04:47,"The bodies were found on the driveway, so any evidence of the killers is going to be out here."
77,00:04:47,00:04:51,I'll check the rear for any sign of forced entry.
78,00:04:51,00:04:54,I'll take the side door.
79,00:04:54,00:04:56,You just get off a shift?
80,00:04:57,00:04:58,Catherine called me.
81,00:04:58,00:04:59,I'm here to help with the case.
82,00:04:59,00:05:01,You look like a man who just rolled out of bed.
83,00:05:01,00:05:03,"You all right? Yeah, why?"
84,00:05:03,00:05:04,"T-shirt, sneakers."
85,00:05:04,00:05:05,You're already a half hour late.
86,00:05:05,00:05:08,Grissom will rip you a new one he sees you like that.
87,00:05:08,00:05:09,Serious?
88,00:05:09,00:05:12,"Yeah, it's not a Rebel game. It's a crime scene."
89,00:05:12,00:05:15,"See, this is what I'm talking about right here."
90,00:05:15,00:05:18,The battery's not changed out of your flashlight.
91,00:05:18,00:05:19,Kit's open.
92,00:05:20,00:05:22,It's not stocked; no swabs.
93,00:05:22,00:05:24,Did you sterilize your equipment after your last case?
94,00:05:24,00:05:26,"Uh, no."
95,00:05:28,00:05:31,"See, you know when I'm on call because my clothes are folded next to my bed."
96,00:05:31,00:05:36,"Shoes, jacket, ball cap, bottle of water, pen, paper, Thomas Guide, next to the phone."
97,00:05:36,00:05:39,"That way, if I get a call at 3:00 in the morning, I'm not scrambled."
98,00:05:39,00:05:42,Everything's there before the phone rings.
99,00:05:42,00:05:43,"My game is tight, like my trunk."
100,00:05:43,00:05:44,Check it out.
101,00:05:50,00:05:53,"Camera case, tripod, film is in the fridge."
102,00:05:53,00:05:54,"Markers, check."
103,00:05:54,00:05:56,"Extra field kit, fully stocked, sterilized."
104,00:05:56,00:06:00,"Shoeprint lift kit, wet weather gear."
105,00:06:00,00:06:05,"Files ""mama."" Forms for days."
106,00:06:05,00:06:10,"First Call form, First Officer form, Consent to Search, Bird's Eye View inside, Bird's Eye View outside."
107,00:06:11,00:06:13,It's down to how I like my lunch.
108,00:06:13,00:06:14,Picking up what I'm putting down?
109,00:06:14,00:06:17,"Yeah. See, no one ever told me."
110,00:06:17,00:06:18,You've been told.
111,00:06:18,00:06:20,"Yes, sir."
112,00:06:30,00:06:33,(indistinct radio transmission)
113,00:07:12,00:07:13,No sign of disturbance in the rear.
114,00:07:14,00:07:17,Cigarette butts.
115,00:07:17,00:07:19,"Orange peel, seeds."
116,00:07:19,00:07:22,"Lying in wait, maybe."
117,00:07:22,00:07:24,You still sucking on that same cough drop?
118,00:07:24,00:07:26,Yeah.
119,00:07:26,00:07:28,I'm a... a slow sucker.
120,00:07:28,00:07:33,"So, assuming the killer didn't live in the community, how did he gain entry?"
121,00:08:19,00:08:20,Crime occurred in the driveway.
122,00:08:20,00:08:23,Nothing to indicate that the suspects were inside the house.
123,00:08:23,00:08:27,"Yes, ma'am. I got it."
124,00:08:27,00:08:28,"So, then, what are we looking for?"
125,00:08:28,00:08:32,Anything inside that'll make the outside make sense.
126,00:08:32,00:08:33,On your hands and knees.
127,00:08:33,00:08:36,Check the carpet for trace.
128,00:09:06,00:09:08,Hey.
129,00:09:08,00:09:10,Greg.
130,00:09:10,00:09:12,I'm going to need you to photograph something.
131,00:09:12,00:09:13,"Why, what'd you find?"
132,00:09:14,00:09:15,It's what I didn't find.
133,00:09:18,00:09:19,"Well, I found something."
134,00:09:19,00:09:21,Blood.
135,00:09:21,00:09:22,Blood?
136,00:09:22,00:09:24,Where?
137,00:09:24,00:09:26,Right here.
138,00:09:31,00:09:34,"Ooh, I also found some videos."
139,00:09:34,00:09:37,Looks like amateur porn.
140,00:09:37,00:09:41,Porn. That figures.
141,00:09:41,00:09:44,Sunburn Sin.Ooh.
142,00:09:44,00:09:51,"""Starring Laurel Lust."" That's Laurel Trent."
143,00:09:51,00:09:53,Isn't that the wife?
144,00:09:53,00:09:54,Yeah.
145,00:09:54,00:09:56,A few years back.
146,00:09:56,00:10:03,"""A Goode/Mike T. Production."" ""Mike T"" as in Mike Trent?"
147,00:10:03,00:10:08,"Well, I bet he seduced her, and then he produced her."
148,00:10:08,00:10:11,ROBBINS: Laurel Trent definitely had some work done.
149,00:10:11,00:10:13,Implants which she later had removed.
150,00:10:13,00:10:17,She has a four- centimeter-long scar at the edge of the areola.
151,00:10:17,00:10:20,Collapsed fibrous capsules in both breasts.
152,00:10:20,00:10:21,Fascinating.
153,00:10:21,00:10:22,Cause of death?
154,00:10:22,00:10:24,I was just getting to that.
155,00:10:24,00:10:27,"Two gunshot wounds to the back of the head, just like her husband."
156,00:10:27,00:10:29,Close range.
157,00:10:29,00:10:31,Either one immediately debilitating and fatal.
158,00:10:31,00:10:33,I sent the bullets to the lab.
159,00:10:33,00:10:36,But this is why I sent for you.
160,00:10:42,00:10:44,Stun gun burns?
161,00:10:46,00:10:47,(zapping)
162,00:10:48,00:10:51,"If you're close enough to stun him, you're close enough to shoot him."
163,00:10:52,00:10:55,And we suspect that there were two assailants.
164,00:10:55,00:10:58,"Well, maybe they were trying to buy time."
165,00:10:58,00:11:02,For what?
166,00:11:04,00:11:06,"Now, the first order of business is to kill the Trents."
167,00:11:07,00:11:10,Then the suspects go upstairs and rip off Laurel's jewelry.
168,00:11:10,00:11:12,And bail on bikes.
169,00:11:12,00:11:14,"That's a little low-rent, don't you think?"
170,00:11:14,00:11:19,"Yeah, but I'm thinking, in a neighborhood like this, if you burn rubber out of here, it's gonna cause a lot of attention."
171,00:11:19,00:11:21,"If you roll quietly away on a bike, though..."
172,00:11:21,00:11:24,"Ah, no one's the wiser. Okay, I get it."
173,00:11:24,00:11:27,This is the resident gate that Greg called me from; he couldn't get in.
174,00:11:27,00:11:31,He needed a code. Sara did find an orange peel in the side yard.
175,00:11:31,00:11:33,"What do you think, sticky fingers?"
176,00:11:33,00:11:35,Does citrus illuminate?
177,00:11:35,00:11:37,"Sugar will, if it's derivatized."
178,00:11:38,00:11:39,Do you have any fluorescent reagents?
179,00:11:39,00:11:40,I've got ANTS.
180,00:11:41,00:11:44,Not the insect. Amino-naphthalene Trisulfonic acid. trisulfonic acid.
181,00:11:44,00:11:45,You're trying to stump me. I can feel it.
182,00:11:46,00:11:47,Let me check it out.
183,00:11:51,00:11:54,The ANTS should make it light up under the ALS.
184,00:12:07,00:12:11,"One, three..."
185,00:12:11,00:12:13,five and six.
186,00:12:13,00:12:16,In some configuration.
187,00:12:16,00:12:18,They had the code.
188,00:12:18,00:12:21,We're mid-case. Why do we have to do this now?
189,00:12:21,00:12:25,"I have to get this evaluation in, orI'mgonna get written up."
190,00:12:25,00:12:27,Okay.
191,00:12:27,00:12:29,My goals.
192,00:12:29,00:12:31,Mm...
193,00:12:31,00:12:32,"Oh, all right, okay."
194,00:12:32,00:12:35,"For starters, I'd like two consecutive nights off."
195,00:12:35,00:12:45,"I would like to cut my triples down to ten a year instead of the usual 20, and, uh, I would love to find a reliable baby-sitter, so I could have myself some kind of a personal life."
196,00:12:45,00:12:48,You don't have a personal life?
197,00:12:48,00:12:54,I... Writethisdown: I haven't had sex in six-- no-- seven months.
198,00:12:59,00:13:01,How can I help?
199,00:13:03,00:13:05,"You. Advance, I mean."
200,00:13:05,00:13:07,Do you...
201,00:13:07,00:13:12,"have any interest in changing sections in the lab, for instance? Gil, how do you do this?"
202,00:13:12,00:13:16,"Honestly, how do you juggle scheduling and vacations and..."
203,00:13:16,00:13:21,The goal of any supervisor is to teach someone how to take his place someday.
204,00:13:21,00:13:23,Are you going someplace?
205,00:13:23,00:13:25,You never know.
206,00:13:25,00:13:26,Are you considering me?
207,00:13:26,00:13:28,Why not?
208,00:13:28,00:13:30,You're certainly qualified.
209,00:13:30,00:13:36,But... a CSI who uses the DNA lab to establish her own paternity...
210,00:13:36,00:13:42,"calls into question... her judgment, don't you think?"
211,00:13:51,00:13:54,You've left that out.
212,00:13:54,00:13:55,Are you covering for me?
213,00:13:55,00:14:00,"I believe that we've dealt with this issue, handled it internally."
214,00:14:00,00:14:02,"As far as I'm concerned, it's dead."
215,00:14:02,00:14:06,"Besides, you'll never do it again."
216,00:14:06,00:14:18,"So just sign your name by the red ""X."" Before I sign, um, since we're putting all of our cards on the table, there's something you should know."
217,00:14:18,00:14:25,"Sam Braun wrote me a check, and... I cashed it."
218,00:14:27,00:14:30,For how much?
219,00:14:30,00:14:36,Enough to where Lindsay and I can do anything and...
220,00:14:36,00:14:39,not enough to where we can do nothing.
221,00:14:39,00:14:42,Sam Braun was a murder suspect in one of your cases.
222,00:14:42,00:14:44,How does this not look like a payoff?
223,00:14:44,00:14:45,I consulted an attorney.
224,00:14:45,00:14:47,It is a check from a father to a daughter.
225,00:14:47,00:14:49,It is completely out of departmental jurisdiction.
226,00:14:49,00:14:51,What about conflict of interest?
227,00:14:51,00:14:52,Not just for you but for this lab.
228,00:14:52,00:14:55,"Gil, I would never compromise you or the lab."
229,00:14:55,00:14:58,"Maybe not legally, but ethically?"
230,00:15:03,00:15:07,"What else should I know, Catherine?"
231,00:15:07,00:15:09,That's everything.
232,00:15:24,00:15:25,Talk to me.
233,00:15:25,00:15:27,"Orange peels, seeds, cigarette butts."
234,00:15:27,00:15:30,I'm logging them in and moving them to DNA.
235,00:15:30,00:15:34,"Okay, so you've gone through her purse, uh, her wallet..."
236,00:15:34,00:15:36,"Yeah, everything's there-- money, credit cards."
237,00:15:36,00:15:38,Yeah. What about the briefcase?
238,00:15:38,00:15:40,Empty. Stop. I-I got a system here.
239,00:15:40,00:15:43,I found this wadded up in her purse.
240,00:15:43,00:15:46,It's a release form-- permission to film an adult movie at the Acid Drop.
241,00:15:46,00:15:48,From Drake the Snake Productions.
242,00:15:48,00:15:50,Signed by a Drake Snow.
243,00:15:55,00:15:57,(rock music playing)
244,00:16:12,00:16:14,I need to see your boss.
245,00:16:14,00:16:16,Follow me.
246,00:16:16,00:16:17,Tonight's for Mike.
247,00:16:17,00:16:21,We pay our respects by ringing the register.
248,00:16:21,00:16:26,"Now, I don't mind if you're talking, just as long as they're drinking."
249,00:16:26,00:16:27,Watch the doubles...
250,00:16:27,00:16:30,Uh...
251,00:16:32,00:16:35,Watch the doubles. Be smart.
252,00:16:35,00:16:38,"You do that, we're gonna take this party through till 6:00 in the morning."
253,00:16:38,00:16:39,"And most importantly, have fun."
254,00:16:39,00:16:40,Okay.
255,00:16:40,00:16:43,Go make some money. See you later.
256,00:16:45,00:16:48,You here about Mike?
257,00:16:48,00:16:50,"Yes, I am."
258,00:16:50,00:16:52,Let's go somewhere private.
259,00:16:52,00:16:54,"Sorry for the inconvenience, everybody."
260,00:16:54,00:16:56,"When you come back, next bottle's on me."
261,00:16:56,00:16:58,Go ahead. (clears throat)
262,00:16:58,00:17:01,"Thanks, Chief. We're going to shut her down for about half an hour."
263,00:17:01,00:17:02,Well...
264,00:17:02,00:17:03,thisisprivate.
265,00:17:03,00:17:05,"It was, um..."
266,00:17:05,00:17:07,"It was a real shock, you know?"
267,00:17:07,00:17:09,Mike and Laurel getting killed like that.
268,00:17:09,00:17:14,"But I got to say, if they had a choice how to go out, it would have been together."
269,00:17:14,00:17:17,"For him, the sun rose and set with her."
270,00:17:17,00:17:20,He didn't treat her like a trophy wife?
271,00:17:20,00:17:22,No. You kidding?
272,00:17:22,00:17:27,"No. He got her off the VHS covers, and she made a home for him."
273,00:17:27,00:17:28,You know?
274,00:17:28,00:17:30,Have a seat.
275,00:17:30,00:17:32,(clears throat)
276,00:17:32,00:17:34,"Um, and what was, uh..."
277,00:17:34,00:17:37,What was your professional affiliation with him?
278,00:17:37,00:17:40,I run his clubs.
279,00:17:40,00:17:43,Ever since he got out of the partner business with Kyle Goode.
280,00:17:44,00:17:48,Have you seen this Mr. Goode lately?
281,00:17:48,00:17:50,He shows his face every once in a while.
282,00:17:50,00:17:52,"I just try to keep him away from Mike, you know?"
283,00:17:52,00:17:54,As much as humanly possible.
284,00:17:55,00:17:57,And...
285,00:17:57,00:18:00,what about this Drake Snow guy?
286,00:18:00,00:18:01,Drake?
287,00:18:01,00:18:02,(laughs): Drake the Snake.
288,00:18:02,00:18:04,"I, uh..."
289,00:18:04,00:18:05,I hired him. He's harmless.
290,00:18:05,00:18:07,He saw one Ron Jeremy movie.
291,00:18:07,00:18:09,Now the guy just sees dollar signs.
292,00:18:09,00:18:11,(laughs)
293,00:18:11,00:18:14,"Uh, and how did he get along with the Trents?"
294,00:18:14,00:18:16,Why don't you go ask him?
295,00:18:16,00:18:18,Reading my mind.
296,00:18:18,00:18:20,Mm.
297,00:18:21,00:18:22,"You, uh..."
298,00:18:23,00:18:24,You never gave me your name.
299,00:18:24,00:18:25,Oh.
300,00:18:25,00:18:26,Catherine.
301,00:18:26,00:18:28,Catherine.
302,00:18:28,00:18:29,Willows.
303,00:18:30,00:18:32,Chris Bezich.
304,00:18:32,00:18:34,Chris Bezich.
305,00:18:34,00:18:36,Come on.
306,00:18:36,00:18:39,Mike and Kyle-- they made all their money out of Laurel taking it off.
307,00:18:39,00:18:42,She-She was a cash register in panties is what she was.
308,00:18:42,00:18:44,And you wanted in?
309,00:18:44,00:18:45,No. Trust me.
310,00:18:45,00:18:48,The last thing that I wanted was to be partners with Mike.
311,00:18:48,00:18:51,Guy'd... Guy'd chew you up and spit you out soon as look at you.
312,00:18:51,00:18:52,And Kyle-- forget it.
313,00:18:52,00:18:55,Guy'd tell you right to your face he's sticking it to you.
314,00:18:55,00:18:56,"Pasadena, baby."
315,00:18:56,00:18:58,I got my own plans.
316,00:18:58,00:18:59,I-I just... I just need a location.
317,00:18:59,00:19:01,One location.
318,00:19:01,00:19:02,And what?
319,00:19:02,00:19:05,Mike didn't agree to it?
320,00:19:05,00:19:06,Didn't ask him.
321,00:19:06,00:19:09,"Last time I asked him for something, he took a swing at me."
322,00:19:10,00:19:10,Get the hell out of my...
323,00:19:10,00:19:13,"I just want the same shot that you had, Mike."
324,00:19:13,00:19:14,Laurel said that...
325,00:19:14,00:19:15,You two aren't in business anymore.
326,00:19:16,00:19:17,(grunts)
327,00:19:17,00:19:19,"In the kitchen, you said?"
328,00:19:20,00:19:21,Yeah.
329,00:19:21,00:19:24,"So, I wasn't going to make that mistake again, so I had to try something different."
330,00:19:24,00:19:25,"So, I pulled a Geffen."
331,00:19:25,00:19:26,I went straight to Yoko.
332,00:19:26,00:19:30,"Oh, you gave Laurel the release form."
333,00:19:30,00:19:32,Yeah. She was going to give it to Mike.
334,00:19:32,00:19:35,"He was going to sign it, and they were going to get it back to me."
335,00:19:35,00:19:36,So much for that.
336,00:19:36,00:19:37,"All right. So, uh, listen, Drake."
337,00:19:37,00:19:39,I'm going to help you get that dream shot.
338,00:19:39,00:19:44,"So that when you do get into the porn biz, you won't have a murder rap hanging over your head."
339,00:19:44,00:19:46,Here.
340,00:19:46,00:19:47,Crime Scene 101.
341,00:19:48,00:19:50,Stick this in your mouth.
342,00:19:50,00:19:52,"Hey, you can set 'em right there."
343,00:19:52,00:19:56,Can't believe that there's this many abandoned bikes in Charleston Hills.
344,00:19:56,00:20:01,"These were found in the alley behind the Fire Department, so check them out."
345,00:20:14,00:20:16,Sugar on the handlebars of both bikes.
346,00:20:16,00:20:17,Just like the keypad.
347,00:20:18,00:20:19,So we may have our getaway bikes.
348,00:20:19,00:20:22,"We could check the serial numbers, but they're usually not recorded."
349,00:20:26,00:20:28,You know what? I got an idea.
350,00:20:28,00:20:31,Hmm?
351,00:20:31,00:20:33,What are you doing?
352,00:20:38,00:20:40,"Get me a pair of tweezers, will you?"
353,00:20:46,00:20:48,(laughs)
354,00:20:51,00:20:53,Now how did you know that receipt was in there?
355,00:20:53,00:20:54,"Well, I used to read point spreads."
356,00:20:55,00:20:55,Now I read books.
357,00:20:56,00:20:57,Good for you.
358,00:20:57,00:21:00,"Bad for Ross Davis, though."
359,00:21:02,00:21:04,This is a little intense for getting my bike stolen.
360,00:21:04,00:21:06,I already got a new one.
361,00:21:06,00:21:07,Did you report it?
362,00:21:07,00:21:08,"No. You're kidding me, right?"
363,00:21:08,00:21:10,"I got jumped, man."
364,00:21:10,00:21:11,By whom?
365,00:21:11,00:21:12,By two bucked-ass brothers.
366,00:21:12,00:21:14,They were both yoked as hell.
367,00:21:14,00:21:15,Ripped.
368,00:21:15,00:21:17,I thought for a second they were going to kill me.
369,00:21:17,00:21:19,(tires squealing)
370,00:21:19,00:21:20,"Hey, hey."
371,00:21:20,00:21:21,(yells)
372,00:21:24,00:21:25,BROWN: Something wrong with your neck?
373,00:21:25,00:21:26,"Man, it's killing me."
374,00:21:26,00:21:31,"I don't know what the hell they hit me with, but my knees was the first to go."
375,00:21:33,00:21:35,I believe you were hit with a stun gun.
376,00:21:35,00:21:37,Just like Mike Trent.
377,00:21:44,00:21:45,I found something on your butt.
378,00:21:45,00:21:47,"Checking out my butt again, Greg?"
379,00:21:47,00:21:48,I was.
380,00:21:48,00:21:51,As well as the four butts Sara got at the crime scene.
381,00:21:51,00:21:52,Oh.
382,00:21:52,00:21:55,"Found something on them that I can't explain, so I sent them over to Hodges."
383,00:21:55,00:21:57,Your butt's fine.
384,00:21:58,00:21:59,Switching gears.
385,00:21:59,00:22:02,Blood found in the Trents' bedroom is a match to Drake Snow.
386,00:22:02,00:22:06,So he told the truth about the blood and lied about the kitchen.
387,00:22:06,00:22:07,Figures.
388,00:22:07,00:22:11,Three of the four cigarette butts are also a match to Drake.
389,00:22:11,00:22:12,Puts him at the scene.
390,00:22:12,00:22:14,And the fourth butt?
391,00:22:14,00:22:17,"Female, not a match to Laurel Trent."
392,00:22:17,00:22:18,Orange seeds?
393,00:22:18,00:22:19,"Two additional donors, both male."
394,00:22:19,00:22:21,Not a match to any of our players.
395,00:22:21,00:22:23,No hits on CODIS.
396,00:22:23,00:22:26,So we're looking for two guys and a gal who might know Drake.
397,00:22:26,00:22:28,BRASS: We already know you lied.
398,00:22:28,00:22:32,"We found your blood in the Trents' bedroom, not in the kitchen."
399,00:22:32,00:22:34,So what were you doing in there?
400,00:22:34,00:22:36,"You putting the shot in her, or what?"
401,00:22:36,00:22:37,"Hey, look."
402,00:22:38,00:22:39,I know where you're going with this.
403,00:22:40,00:22:42,"Okay, I was in the bedroom."
404,00:22:42,00:22:45,She wasn't on her knees. I was.
405,00:22:45,00:22:47,I was begging. Not for sex.
406,00:22:47,00:22:49,I was begging for my business.
407,00:22:50,00:22:51,Drake the Snake Productions.
408,00:22:51,00:22:55,"Mike comes busting in, goes ballistic, smacks me in the nose..."
409,00:22:55,00:23:00,"I mean, I know I keep coming back to this three-and-out thing, but maybe because you're in bed with his wife."
410,00:23:00,00:23:02,Laurel and I didn't have sex in the bedroom.
411,00:23:02,00:23:06,"We had it on the set-- past tense, long time ago."
412,00:23:06,00:23:07,Then along came Mike.
413,00:23:07,00:23:09,Mike was good for Laurel.
414,00:23:09,00:23:11,Mike was not good for me.
415,00:23:11,00:23:13,She got carte blanche-- Laurel.
416,00:23:13,00:23:14,"Me, I got a bar back."
417,00:23:14,00:23:18,"Now I'm popping blue pills looking for something to bring me down, but I know the business."
418,00:23:18,00:23:21,I just don't have the capital to get behind the camera.
419,00:23:21,00:23:23,So what does killing the Trents get you?
420,00:23:25,00:23:27,Zero.
421,00:23:27,00:23:31,No one was more upset than me.
422,00:23:31,00:23:33,You're still pouring drinks. Boo-hoo.
423,00:23:33,00:23:36,And what are you doing smoking around their place?
424,00:23:38,00:23:39,What?
425,00:23:39,00:23:42,"Yeah, we found cigarette butts with your DNA on it on their property."
426,00:23:42,00:23:45,I don't know what you're talking about.
427,00:23:45,00:23:46,I don't.
428,00:23:46,00:23:48,"I smoke one place, okay?"
429,00:23:48,00:23:50,I smoke at work.
430,00:23:50,00:23:51,I'm down to one a day.
431,00:23:51,00:23:55,"Right after happy hour, I have my one cigarette, and it's out back by the service register."
432,00:23:55,00:23:56,You ask anybody.
433,00:23:58,00:24:00,"BEZICH: Drake's telling the truth, you know?"
434,00:24:00,00:24:01,He smokes one a day.
435,00:24:01,00:24:03,"Not on the floor, right here, my rule."
436,00:24:04,00:24:07,"Mm-hmm, well, still have to verify it with evidence."
437,00:24:10,00:24:12,You verify everything?
438,00:24:12,00:24:15,Everything.
439,00:24:15,00:24:17,Including you.
440,00:24:17,00:24:20,You're clear.
441,00:24:20,00:24:23,"Can you blame Drake, you know?"
442,00:24:24,00:24:26,He's trying to give up cigarettes.
443,00:24:26,00:24:28,That's like me trying to give up...
444,00:24:28,00:24:30,Sex?
445,00:24:30,00:24:34,"Everybody needs to indulge in a vice at least once a day, right?"
446,00:24:34,00:24:40,"Yes, well, I did happen to notice those little waitress girlies trying to serve their way into bed with you."
447,00:24:40,00:24:43,That's work.
448,00:24:43,00:24:45,I prefer women.
449,00:24:45,00:24:48,"Speaking of work, do you, um..."
450,00:24:48,00:24:50,ever get a day off?
451,00:24:54,00:24:55,What?
452,00:24:55,00:24:57,You want to get to know me?
453,00:24:57,00:24:59,Yes.
454,00:25:12,00:25:13,Um...
455,00:25:13,00:25:15,What?
456,00:25:15,00:25:16,Wait. Hang on.
457,00:25:17,00:25:18,I'm on the clock.
458,00:25:18,00:25:21,(chuckles)
459,00:25:21,00:25:23,You started it.
460,00:25:23,00:25:26,"Yes, and when the time is right, maybe I'll finish it."
461,00:25:29,00:25:33,(distant siren wails)
462,00:25:38,00:25:39,How you feeling?
463,00:25:39,00:25:41,Hey. What do you mean?
464,00:25:41,00:25:44,"Well, you were popping cough drops at the scene the other day a mile a minute."
465,00:25:44,00:25:46,I thought I was coming down with a cold.
466,00:25:46,00:25:48,Ah.
467,00:25:48,00:25:50,"Yeah, I, uh..."
468,00:25:50,00:25:53,I understand colds.
469,00:25:53,00:26:00,"You know, back in Jersey when I was getting it from both ends, from my wife and my work, things started to get heavy."
470,00:26:00,00:26:03,I started medicating.
471,00:26:03,00:26:05,Cure my cold.
472,00:26:05,00:26:13,"And, um, and God forbid I had an early morning roll-out and I had that tell-tale breath, you know what I mean?"
473,00:26:13,00:26:19,"So I would dodge my supe, and I started popping cough drops."
474,00:26:19,00:26:22,Huh.
475,00:26:22,00:26:25,"I mean, what I'm trying to say is that..."
476,00:26:25,00:26:30,"there's more problems than answers in the bottom of a bottle, believe me."
477,00:26:31,00:26:33,Yeah. (sighs)
478,00:26:33,00:26:40,"Actually, I had a couple of beers with breakfast when I got off shift."
479,00:26:40,00:26:43,And then I got called in.
480,00:26:43,00:26:45,Just a couple?
481,00:26:45,00:26:47,Yeah.
482,00:26:49,00:26:50,I'm just looking out for you.
483,00:27:00,00:27:02,"Hey, what are you doing after work?"
484,00:27:02,00:27:04,More work.
485,00:27:04,00:27:06,"You got photos of Laurel Trents' jewelry, huh?"
486,00:27:06,00:27:14,"Yeah, two-carat diamond earrings, ruby necklace, diamond and sapphire bracelet, lady's gold Rolex."
487,00:27:14,00:27:16,The insurance company says it's worth somewhere north of two mil.
488,00:27:17,00:27:20,I got every pawn shop in town on the lookout.
489,00:27:20,00:27:21,What?
490,00:27:21,00:27:26,You know that feeling you get when you just can't quite put your finger on something?
491,00:27:26,00:27:29,What can't you put your finger on besides the clock-out button?
492,00:27:29,00:27:32,Why did they drag his body down the driveway?
493,00:27:32,00:27:34,Dragging's your racket.
494,00:27:34,00:27:37,But I can tell you who's dragging Mike Trent into court.
495,00:27:37,00:27:39,"His ex-business partner, Kyle Goode."
496,00:27:39,00:27:41,HODGES: Evidence.
497,00:27:41,00:27:43,Evidence in context.
498,00:27:43,00:27:45,Take a look.
499,00:27:48,00:27:52,Trace on the cigarette butt is a match to the sand I collected from the ashtray.
500,00:27:52,00:27:53,At Acid Drop.
501,00:27:53,00:27:56,Now...
502,00:27:56,00:27:58,take a look at this.
503,00:27:58,00:28:04,"I found trace amounts of soil in the orange seeds and the orange peel, but not on any of the butts."
504,00:28:04,00:28:06,So it's possible that the butts were planted.
505,00:28:10,00:28:13,May explain why there seems to be so many suspects at the crime scene.
506,00:28:13,00:28:17,Probably clears Drake Snow and your unidentified female smoker.
507,00:28:17,00:28:19,Where does that leave you?
508,00:28:19,00:28:21,With two guys on bikes.
509,00:28:21,00:28:23,(gunfire)
510,00:28:25,00:28:26,Hit that ninja.
511,00:28:26,00:28:27,On the bridge.
512,00:28:27,00:28:28,That's it.
513,00:28:29,00:28:30,Kyle Goode?
514,00:28:30,00:28:31,Uh-huh.
515,00:28:31,00:28:33,"I'm Detective Jim Brass, Homicide."
516,00:28:33,00:28:36,I was wondering when you guys would get around to me.
517,00:28:36,00:28:38,Why's that?
518,00:28:38,00:28:39,My ex-partner's murdered.
519,00:28:39,00:28:42,I got a lawsuit against him. He owes me millions.
520,00:28:42,00:28:43,I'd like me for it.
521,00:28:43,00:28:46,"Great, then we won't have to pull teeth to get to the truth."
522,00:28:46,00:28:48,Where were you yesterday morning?
523,00:28:48,00:28:50,"With my son, Alex."
524,00:28:50,00:28:52,Where?
525,00:28:52,00:28:54,(gunfire)
526,00:28:54,00:28:56,You're not going to believe anything I tell you.
527,00:28:56,00:28:57,Why don't you ask him?
528,00:28:57,00:28:59,"Okay. Come, Alex."
529,00:28:59,00:29:00,Get off the game.
530,00:29:00,00:29:01,That's enough.
531,00:29:01,00:29:03,You cost me a man.
532,00:29:03,00:29:04,I got more quarters.
533,00:29:07,00:29:09,"So, Alex, where were you yesterday morning?"
534,00:29:09,00:29:10,At Grandma's.
535,00:29:10,00:29:12,All morning?
536,00:29:12,00:29:13,No.
537,00:29:13,00:29:15,She lives in Laughlin.
538,00:29:15,00:29:16,My dad drove me.
539,00:29:16,00:29:17,What time did you get there?
540,00:29:18,00:29:19,I don't know. I was sleeping.
541,00:29:19,00:29:21,Maybe around... 11:00?
542,00:29:21,00:29:23,You sure about that?
543,00:29:23,00:29:25,Yeah.
544,00:29:25,00:29:27,"When I woke up, Captain Cavemanwas on."
545,00:29:27,00:29:31,"Okay, Laughlin's about 21/////2 hours away, so you and your son left home around 8:30?"
546,00:29:32,00:29:33,More like 8:00.
547,00:29:33,00:29:35,Alex likes those breakfast sandwiches.
548,00:29:35,00:29:36,We picked a couple up. Ate them on the way.
549,00:29:36,00:29:37,Where'd you pick them up?
550,00:29:37,00:29:39,Sunny Side's over on Eastern.
551,00:29:39,00:29:41,You looking for an alibi?
552,00:29:41,00:29:42,"Something like that, yeah."
553,00:29:42,00:29:45,"Come on, Alex. Let's go over to Circus Circus."
554,00:29:45,00:29:47,They got a real arcade.
555,00:29:59,00:30:00,Thank you for visiting Sunny Side's.
556,00:30:00,00:30:02,"Next in line, please. Hi."
557,00:30:02,00:30:03,Would you like to try the Sunny Side's Special?
558,00:30:03,00:30:04,"No, I'm Nick Stokes."
559,00:30:04,00:30:06,I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
560,00:30:06,00:30:07,Can I talk to you for a second?
561,00:30:07,00:30:08,Um...
562,00:30:12,00:30:14,Are you Missy Wilson?
563,00:30:14,00:30:15,Are you a truant officer?
564,00:30:15,00:30:16,No.
565,00:30:17,00:30:21,Your manager said you were working breakfast the other day at the pick-up window.
566,00:30:21,00:30:22,Yeah.
567,00:30:22,00:30:24,Do you remember this guy?
568,00:30:24,00:30:26,"Oh, my God."
569,00:30:26,00:30:29,That's the creep who was hitting on me.
570,00:30:29,00:30:31,He was so repulsive. You know what he said to me?
571,00:30:31,00:30:34,"I'd like to bend you over the counter, baby."
572,00:30:36,00:30:38,And he said it in front of his kid.
573,00:30:38,00:30:39,What kind of father acts like that?
574,00:30:40,00:30:41,Sounds like he wanted to make an impression.
575,00:30:41,00:30:42,"Oh, he did."
576,00:30:42,00:30:44,I hope you're going to arrest him.
577,00:30:44,00:30:45,One thing at a time.
578,00:30:45,00:30:46,Now this window...
579,00:30:46,00:30:51,"I get all the creeps in drive-through-- teenagers, perverts, walk-ups, and those are my favorites."
580,00:30:51,00:30:52,"""Hi, I'm on a skateboard."
581,00:30:53,00:30:57,"Can I have a burger combo?"" ""No, dork."" Does this window have a surveillance camera?"
582,00:30:57,00:30:59,"Oh, yeah, we have cameras all over here."
583,00:30:59,00:31:01,Even in the cooler.
584,00:31:05,00:31:06,Confirms his alibi.
585,00:31:06,00:31:12,"Every suspect Brass leans on seems to have a case of the ""airtights."" Hold it. Run that back."
586,00:31:16,00:31:17,Pause it.
587,00:31:19,00:31:21,What is that around the kid's neck?
588,00:31:21,00:31:22,I don't know.
589,00:31:22,00:31:23,Let's enhance it.
590,00:31:30,00:31:32,Almost looks like a canteen.
591,00:31:33,00:31:38,"You bring a canteen up to your lips, not to your eyes."
592,00:31:38,00:31:41,"I'll pull some stills, see what I can make of it."
593,00:31:41,00:31:42,(phone ringing)
594,00:31:42,00:31:45,AV Lab. Grissom.
595,00:31:47,00:31:49,I'll be right there.
596,00:31:50,00:31:53,(distant siren blares)
597,00:31:59,00:32:04,"BRASS: Well, he lived by the stun, but I don't think he died by it."
598,00:32:04,00:32:05,He didn't.
599,00:32:05,00:32:09,"Uh, two gunshot wounds to the back of the head."
600,00:32:09,00:32:10,TOD is within the hour.
601,00:32:10,00:32:13,GRISSOM: Blood spatter everywhere.
602,00:32:15,00:32:18,Multiple directionalities.
603,00:32:22,00:32:23,"You almost done, David?"
604,00:32:23,00:32:24,"Uh, yes, sir."
605,00:32:24,00:32:26,He's all yours.
606,00:32:26,00:32:27,Thanks.
607,00:32:27,00:32:29,I want to pick his pockets.
608,00:32:37,00:32:38,M...
609,00:32:38,00:32:40,and T.
610,00:32:41,00:32:42,Doesn't look like Michael Trent.
611,00:32:43,00:32:46,"If he's one of our bad guys on the bicycle, where's his partner?"
612,00:32:46,00:32:48,And where's the rest of the jewelry?
613,00:32:48,00:32:50,That's probably what his partner said before he tossed the room.
614,00:33:04,00:33:07,(indistinct police radio chatter)
615,00:33:52,00:33:57,"Hey, look what I found: a knife with blood on it."
616,00:33:57,00:34:00,Look what I found: a dead guy.
617,00:34:02,00:34:04,(police radio chattering)
618,00:34:04,00:34:08,Nine-millimeter.
619,00:34:08,00:34:10,Pillowcase full of jewelry.
620,00:34:14,00:34:18,"Two stacks of $10,000 bricks."
621,00:34:18,00:34:24,"Well, either they pawned some diamonds at the US Treasury, or they're on someone's payroll."
622,00:34:24,00:34:28,You know what that means: hit-for-hire.
623,00:34:28,00:34:32,And we're still looking for somebody.
624,00:34:34,00:34:35,Who gets the honors: him or him?
625,00:34:35,00:34:38,"Eh, let's start with Mr. Head Wound."
626,00:34:38,00:34:41,You've seen these before.
627,00:34:41,00:34:42,Stun gun.
628,00:34:42,00:34:44,The debilitator of choice.
629,00:34:44,00:34:46,"(zapping, screaming)"
630,00:34:46,00:34:49,(screaming)
631,00:34:49,00:34:50,(gunshots)
632,00:34:50,00:34:53,Heard you found a nine- millimeter at the scene?
633,00:34:53,00:34:55,Mm-hmm. I sent the bullets to ballistics.
634,00:34:55,00:34:58,How about his body? Any lead in him?
635,00:34:58,00:35:00,"No, but he took a blade to the stomach."
636,00:35:01,00:35:05,"The cut was shallow, five or six centimeters below the sternum."
637,00:35:05,00:35:07,Like the soft spot in a dragon.
638,00:35:11,00:35:12,(screams)
639,00:35:12,00:35:14,(screaming)
640,00:35:14,00:35:16,Sounds like no honor among thieves.
641,00:35:16,00:35:19,"Well, I'll tell you what they were fighting over."
642,00:35:19,00:35:20,The jewelry was hot.
643,00:35:20,00:35:22,Either you fence it fast or eat the loss.
644,00:35:22,00:35:25,I'm thinking more and more it was never part of the plan.
645,00:35:25,00:35:26,"You know, you could be right."
646,00:35:26,00:35:28,I talked to the Trents' bank.
647,00:35:28,00:35:33,They were on their way to the safety deposit box that morning and then off to Hawaii at the end of the week.
648,00:35:33,00:35:36,So it was Laurel Trent who cleaned out her own jewelry box.
649,00:35:36,00:35:40,"Yeah. Murder was their wage, and jewelry was their tip."
650,00:35:41,00:35:43,(computer beeping)
651,00:35:47,00:35:48,(sighs)
652,00:35:48,00:35:51,How's your hands?
653,00:35:51,00:35:53,Sore.
654,00:35:53,00:35:54,Document every single bill. Fun.
655,00:35:54,00:35:56,I got to hand it to these casinos.
656,00:35:56,00:35:58,They got it all figured out.
657,00:35:58,00:36:01,SIDLE: What do you mean?
658,00:36:01,00:36:03,"Well, this is a $10,000 brick, right?"
659,00:36:03,00:36:04,Mm-hmm.
660,00:36:04,00:36:10,"I could either lose this in a hand of blackjack, or I could lose cranberry chip."
661,00:36:10,00:36:12,What's worse?
662,00:36:12,00:36:14,"To me, losing's losing."
663,00:36:14,00:36:16,(chuckles)
664,00:36:17,00:36:19,Sara?
665,00:36:19,00:36:23,I got a bloodstain.
666,00:36:23,00:36:28,"SANDERS: You know, the last time I checked, defacing government property was a federal offense."
667,00:36:28,00:36:31,"Not when it's logged in as property, Greg."
668,00:36:31,00:36:33,The blood might be from a paper cut.
669,00:36:33,00:36:35,"Okay, but you're my witness."
670,00:36:40,00:36:41,Run it against all our players.
671,00:36:41,00:36:42,Uh-huh.
672,00:36:42,00:36:45,I finished up on those still photos.
673,00:36:45,00:36:48,The canteen around little Alex's neck...
674,00:36:48,00:36:51,is really a set of binoculars.
675,00:36:53,00:36:57,"If you keep flipping, it tells the rest of the story."
676,00:37:02,00:37:09,"Now, call me crazy, but it looks like Daddy doesn't like the little man wearing the binoculars around his neck so much."
677,00:37:09,00:37:12,I wonder why?
678,00:37:12,00:37:15,(distant siren blaring)
679,00:37:40,00:37:42,What are you thinking?
680,00:37:42,00:37:45,Stay right here until I call you.
681,00:37:55,00:37:58,(cell phone rings)
682,00:38:00,00:38:01,Yeah?
683,00:38:01,00:38:05,"Nick, would you move about halfway up the driveway?"
684,00:38:05,00:38:07,Back where Mike Trent was shot?
685,00:38:07,00:38:09,Exactly.
686,00:38:13,00:38:15,How's this? Can you see me here?
687,00:38:16,00:38:18,"No, I can't."
688,00:38:18,00:38:19,Thank you.
689,00:38:19,00:38:20,(phone beeps)
690,00:38:56,00:38:59,(engine revving)
691,00:38:59,00:39:03,(keypad beeping)
692,00:39:03,00:39:05,(line ringing)
693,00:39:05,00:39:08,Jim? Gil.
694,00:39:08,00:39:10,I'm fine. How are you?
695,00:39:10,00:39:13,"Would you put an APB out on Kyle Goode's vehicle, please?"
696,00:39:17,00:39:19,BRASS: You recognize this?
697,00:39:19,00:39:21,That's my kid.
698,00:39:21,00:39:24,What's that around his neck?
699,00:39:24,00:39:25,That's his binoculars.
700,00:39:25,00:39:29,"Yeah. Zeiss, 20x60, BSGA."
701,00:39:29,00:39:32,"4,500 a pop."
702,00:39:32,00:39:33,You know how it is.
703,00:39:33,00:39:36,"You got your kid in the car, traveling a long distance."
704,00:39:36,00:39:37,Whatever keeps them occupied.
705,00:39:37,00:39:39,"According to your son, he slept all the way to Laughlin."
706,00:39:39,00:39:42,Kid falling asleep in a car on the way to his Grandma's house?
707,00:39:42,00:39:45,You guys won't even make it through the courthouse door.
708,00:39:45,00:39:46,Court.
709,00:39:46,00:39:48,That's where the lawyers get fat.
710,00:39:48,00:39:50,And you know all about that.
711,00:39:51,00:39:55,"I mean, you've got a lawsuit with your ex-business partner, and your ex-wife, who's suing you for past alimony..."
712,00:39:55,00:39:57,That's irrelevant.
713,00:39:57,00:39:58,Not according to his wife it isn't.
714,00:39:58,00:40:01,She gave us permission for a hair sample from your son.
715,00:40:01,00:40:02,For what?
716,00:40:02,00:40:06,"The good thing about drugs-- they work their way through the bloodstream in the urine, but not the hair."
717,00:40:06,00:40:13,"Our lab found trace elements of Ambien, which is a hypnotic sleep sedative, in your son's hair root."
718,00:40:13,00:40:16,"Until we see the test results, we're withholding comment."
719,00:40:16,00:40:19,"No problem, counselor. Okay, moving on."
720,00:40:19,00:40:23,"The ""buy"" money, the 20K that we found on the two geniuses you hired?"
721,00:40:23,00:40:29,"What geniuses? You know, the brothers, who are so cool and laid back, they're in the morgue."
722,00:40:29,00:40:31,"Oh, what? You didn't know they're dead?"
723,00:40:31,00:40:32,"Yeah, they greased each other over the jewelry."
724,00:40:32,00:40:35,"And that wasn't even part of the deal in the first place, was it?"
725,00:40:40,00:40:43,"Good help is hard to find, huh, Kyle?"
726,00:40:43,00:40:44,He's not answering that.
727,00:40:44,00:40:47,I hated that son of a bitch.
728,00:40:47,00:40:51,"Mike Trent was a scumbag, worst of the worst."
729,00:40:51,00:40:53,Use you up and blow right through you.
730,00:40:53,00:40:55,I brought him in on my nickel.
731,00:40:55,00:40:57,And he throws me out?
732,00:40:57,00:41:00,Invests our money in clubs and kicks me out? To do what?
733,00:41:00,00:41:02,To ride off into the sunset with my piece of sushi?
734,00:41:02,00:41:04,And it's not just me.
735,00:41:04,00:41:08,There's a lot guys out there got burned by him who wouldn't mind a little revenge.
736,00:41:08,00:41:13,"I'll even go so far as to say I'm not sorry he's dead, or rotting somewhere in some box."
737,00:41:18,00:41:22,But I'll say this for sure: I didn't kill him.
738,00:41:22,00:41:24,I'm not saying you did.
739,00:41:24,00:41:26,Or his wife.
740,00:41:26,00:41:29,"But your $20,000 incentive pulled the trigger."
741,00:41:29,00:41:33,And you know what-- you won't believe this-- a paper cut gave you away.
742,00:41:33,00:41:35,...ten makes 20 large.
743,00:41:37,00:41:40,"When you do it, I want to see it."
744,00:41:40,00:41:41,I'll be up here.
745,00:41:41,00:41:45,BRASS: We did the DNA test for the cigarette butt you left at the arcade.
746,00:41:45,00:41:47,"Plain view, right counselor?"
747,00:41:47,00:41:49,And we matched it to the blood we found on the money.
748,00:41:49,00:41:51,He didn't hire two killers. He only hired me.
749,00:41:51,00:41:53,"Yeah, well, lawsuits take a while."
750,00:41:53,00:41:56,"I don't think you cared about a verdict anyway, did you, Kyle?"
751,00:41:56,00:41:59,You wanted much more than that.
752,00:42:05,00:42:06,(screaming)
753,00:42:09,00:42:12,God...
754,00:42:12,00:42:15,(whimpers) (cocks hammer)
755,00:42:15,00:42:17,(gun fires twice)
756,00:42:17,00:42:19,(echoing): No!
757,00:42:19,00:42:22,(gun fires twice)
758,00:42:22,00:42:26,My client was with his son all day that day.
759,00:42:27,00:42:28,"Yeah, that's where he screwed up."
760,00:42:28,00:42:32,Your hatred of Trent was stronger than your love for your own child.
761,00:42:32,00:42:38,You drugged your son so you could use him as an alibi.
762,00:42:38,00:42:42,And that's all a jury's going to need to hear to convict you.
763,00:42:42,00:42:44,"Kyle Goode, you've been bad."
764,00:42:44,00:42:47,You're under arrest.
765,00:42:57,00:42:58,Oh... you're still here.
766,00:42:58,00:43:02,Uh... (clears throat) so I'm leaving.
767,00:43:02,00:43:03,Need anything?
768,00:43:03,00:43:05,"No, I'm good."
769,00:43:06,00:43:07,Are we good?
770,00:43:10,00:43:12,We'll be fine.
771,00:43:12,00:43:14,Okay.
772,00:43:14,00:43:15,I'll see you tomorrow.
773,00:43:15,00:43:17,Going out?
774,00:43:19,00:43:23,I've got some unfinished business to take care of.
775,00:43:23,00:43:26,I'll see you.
