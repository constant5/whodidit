1,00:00:29,00:00:31,"Hey man, this place is a dump."
2,00:00:31,00:00:35,"I'm telling you, this bitch is loaded and no one's seen her for weeks."
3,00:00:37,00:00:38,"Come on, this place is trashed."
4,00:00:38,00:00:40,You trying to make me look stupid?
5,00:00:40,00:00:42,"No, man. I swear. Somebody must have beat us to it."
6,00:00:42,00:00:43,What the hell is this?
7,00:00:44,00:00:45,"(short, abrupt siren sounding)"
8,00:00:45,00:00:48,"I'm out, man."
9,00:00:51,00:00:56,"MAN: Gentlemen, put your hands on your heads, please."
10,00:01:29,00:01:31,Smudges.
11,00:01:31,00:01:33,Nothing but smudges.
12,00:01:33,00:01:36,Doesn't anybody use Formica anymore?
13,00:01:37,00:01:41,MAN: First thing we did when we saw this was call you guys.
14,00:01:41,00:01:42,Didn't touch a thing.
15,00:01:44,00:01:46,(sighs)
16,00:01:46,00:01:48,So you going to open it?
17,00:01:48,00:01:51,Eventually.
18,00:02:08,00:02:09,(quietly): This is going to take all day.
19,00:02:11,00:02:34,"Sun Tzu once said, ""If you wait ""by the river long enough, the bodies of your enemies will float by."" But those were brutal times."
20,00:03:20,00:03:22,"Hey, hold up."
21,00:03:24,00:03:25,Warrick?
22,00:03:25,00:03:28,"Hey, David. Give me a minute and let me clear a path here, okay?"
23,00:03:28,00:03:30,"All right, I'm not going anywhere."
24,00:03:30,00:03:32,All right.
25,00:03:36,00:03:39,"There's at least four weeks of mail here, Grissom."
26,00:03:39,00:03:42,"Four weeks of 100 degree days, zero percent humidity."
27,00:03:43,00:03:46,"Eventually, the body tissues sublimate."
28,00:03:46,00:03:52,"Cell fluids vaporize, and all that's left -- Proteins, fats and minerals."
29,00:03:52,00:03:55,BROWN: Turns a grape into a raisin.
30,00:03:55,00:03:58,"Well, the desert was making mummies long before the Egyptians."
31,00:04:01,00:04:03,Take a look at this.
32,00:04:08,00:04:10,And look at her fingers.
33,00:04:15,00:04:17,She tried to claw her way out.
34,00:04:17,00:04:19,Yeah.
35,00:04:20,00:04:24,Which means she was alive when she was entombed.
36,00:04:26,00:04:27,"She was supposed to be, like, this old widow, right?"
37,00:04:27,00:04:30,"Like, always going out to dinner and coming home with shopping bags."
38,00:04:30,00:04:34,Bitch had insurance money and word was that she kept it in a box hidden under her bed.
39,00:04:34,00:04:36,A retired grade-school teacher living on a pension...
40,00:04:36,00:04:38,"Listen, man, we didn't kill her."
41,00:04:38,00:04:39,"No, I know that."
42,00:04:39,00:04:44,"What I want to know is, other than the back door, did you or your partner touch anything in the house?"
43,00:04:44,00:04:47,"No. There was nothing left totouch, man."
44,00:05:12,00:05:14,"Hey, Griss."
45,00:05:16,00:05:17,Seem kind of odd to you?
46,00:05:17,00:05:23,A woman who spends the time making tea like this leaves a chunk of chocolate cake on the counter.
47,00:05:24,00:05:26,With a big bite out of it? Yeah.
48,00:05:28,00:05:35,"Some crack head brutalizes an old lady, leaves her in a closet, and grabs a snack on the way out."
49,00:05:35,00:05:36,Hopefully.
50,00:05:36,00:05:39,Take it back to the lab.
51,00:06:29,00:06:30,"Shut up, get in there!"
52,00:06:30,00:06:32,Oh!
53,00:06:34,00:06:37,(labored gasping)
54,00:06:43,00:06:47,(groans)
55,00:06:50,00:06:52,(groaning)
56,00:06:55,00:06:58,(groaning)
57,00:06:59,00:07:01,(weak groan): Oh.
58,00:07:15,00:07:22,"Fluoroscope showed no bullet or stab wounds, and apart from multiple fractures of her fingers and hands, no other apparent injuries."
59,00:07:23,00:07:26,So whoever boarded her up in the closet maybe didn't intend to kill her.
60,00:07:26,00:07:27,Yeah.
61,00:07:27,00:07:30,They must have thought somebody'd find her-- a friend or relative.
62,00:07:30,00:07:31,She lived alone.
63,00:07:31,00:07:33,Only relative was a nephew.
64,00:07:33,00:07:34,Brass is looking for him.
65,00:07:34,00:07:37,"Live alone, die alone."
66,00:07:37,00:07:40,"In this case, from massive dehydration."
67,00:07:40,00:07:46,"Rule of Threes: Three minutes without air, three days without water, and three weeks without food."
68,00:07:46,00:07:49,Three days must have felt like three years.
69,00:07:50,00:07:52,Warrick said you found a possible print at the scene.
70,00:07:53,00:07:54,Need to rule hers out?
71,00:07:54,00:07:57,Yeah. Also need a dental impression.
72,00:07:57,00:07:59,"Well, that'll be easy."
73,00:08:11,00:08:13,"WILLOWS: So, what do we have here?"
74,00:08:13,00:08:17,"Well, boy was out playing, found the weapon, fired one shot, dropped the weapon."
75,00:08:17,00:08:18,No one's touched it since.
76,00:08:18,00:08:19,Hmm.
77,00:08:19,00:08:21,"Okay, thanks."
78,00:08:21,00:08:23,Yeah.
79,00:08:51,00:08:53,"Hey, Nathan."
80,00:08:53,00:08:55,How's your foot?
81,00:08:55,00:08:56,I got a rocket ship Band-Aid.
82,00:08:57,00:08:58,Hmm.
83,00:08:58,00:09:00,"Yeah, I see that."
84,00:09:00,00:09:03,"Mrs. Timmel, does the gun belong to someone in the house?"
85,00:09:03,00:09:04,"No, absolutely not."
86,00:09:04,00:09:06,My husband and I don't believe in guns.
87,00:09:06,00:09:09,We moved here from the city because it was supposed to be safer.
88,00:09:10,00:09:12,"Nathan, where did you find the gun?"
89,00:09:12,00:09:15,Seymour found it.
90,00:09:15,00:09:16,Seymour?
91,00:09:16,00:09:18,(whispering): His imaginary friend.
92,00:09:19,00:09:23,"So, you were playing with Seymour, and he found the gun where?"
93,00:09:23,00:09:24,Over there.
94,00:09:24,00:09:26,"Well, where exactly?"
95,00:09:26,00:09:27,In the backyard.
96,00:09:28,00:09:29,Was it buried?
97,00:09:29,00:09:30,Did you dig it up?
98,00:09:30,00:09:32,Nope.
99,00:09:34,00:09:36,(gunshot)
100,00:09:36,00:09:38,Will you ever play with guns again?
101,00:09:38,00:09:41,Nope.
102,00:09:43,00:09:45,We don't need an I.D..
103,00:09:45,00:09:48,"Oh, the nephew said he wanted to see her."
104,00:09:48,00:09:49,Insisted on it.
105,00:09:49,00:09:50,Made me curious.
106,00:09:51,00:09:53,You Connor Foster?
107,00:09:53,00:09:54,Yeah.
108,00:09:54,00:09:56,I'm sorry I'm late. I got lost.
109,00:09:58,00:10:01,"This is the morgue, huh?"
110,00:10:01,00:10:03,You have to prepare yourself for this.
111,00:10:03,00:10:07,Your aunt was found in an advanced state of decomposition.
112,00:10:11,00:10:14,"Oh, this is messed up."
113,00:10:14,00:10:17,This is really messed up.
114,00:10:19,00:10:20,Whoa! She just moved.
115,00:10:20,00:10:21,Did you see that?
116,00:10:21,00:10:24,"I'm telling you, she just moved."
117,00:10:24,00:10:31,"Sometimes, when you see the body of someone you know, someone you've seen move before, you want them to move."
118,00:10:31,00:10:32,That's not her.
119,00:10:32,00:10:33,This lady's too thin.
120,00:10:33,00:10:35,"That's not her skin, either."
121,00:10:35,00:10:36,My aunt always wore sunblock.
122,00:10:36,00:10:38,Dry mouth.
123,00:10:38,00:10:40,Diaphoresis.
124,00:10:40,00:10:41,"Red eyes, dilated pupils."
125,00:10:42,00:10:43,Huh?
126,00:10:43,00:10:45,It means you're high.
127,00:10:46,00:10:48,I got to go.
128,00:10:48,00:10:50,We'd like you to stay.
129,00:10:52,00:10:54,"BRASS: Where are you living these days, Connor?"
130,00:10:55,00:10:58,"At the YMCA off Industrial, near the underpass."
131,00:10:58,00:10:59,Nice.
132,00:10:59,00:11:01,How's work?
133,00:11:02,00:11:03,I don't have a job.
134,00:11:03,00:11:04,I used to.
135,00:11:04,00:11:08,"Yeah. Yeah, two years ago, your aunt reported a pearl necklace stolen."
136,00:11:08,00:11:10,You were busted trying to hock it at a pawn shop.
137,00:11:10,00:11:13,She dropped those charges.
138,00:11:13,00:11:14,"Oh, sure."
139,00:11:14,00:11:15,Anything for her favorite nephew.
140,00:11:15,00:11:17,And what have you done for her?
141,00:11:17,00:11:19,She was lying in a coat closet for over a month.
142,00:11:19,00:11:20,You didn't call.
143,00:11:20,00:11:22,You didn't stop by.
144,00:11:22,00:11:24,I don't call her much.
145,00:11:24,00:11:27,We only have dinner on holidays.
146,00:11:27,00:11:31,"Whenever she sees me, it makes her kind of sad."
147,00:11:31,00:11:33,Do you get the munchies?
148,00:11:33,00:11:35,When?
149,00:11:35,00:11:36,When you're high.
150,00:11:39,00:11:42,Do you like cake?
151,00:11:42,00:11:44,"(laughs): No, I go for burgers."
152,00:11:44,00:11:45,Sonic.
153,00:11:46,00:11:50,How would you like to make a dental impression for us?
154,00:11:50,00:11:52,I'll do whatever you guys want.
155,00:11:52,00:11:53,"Hey, Rich."
156,00:11:53,00:11:55,Whatcha got for me?
157,00:11:55,00:11:58,Found this somewhere where it didn't belong. (paper crinkling)
158,00:11:58,00:12:00,Unregistered. No prints.
159,00:12:00,00:12:02,Huh. Sweet piece. Mm-hmm.
160,00:12:02,00:12:04,.32 Beretta Tomcat.
161,00:12:04,00:12:08,"Titanium frame, stainless steel barrel and slide."
162,00:12:08,00:12:09,Super lightweight.
163,00:12:09,00:12:11,"Yeah, light enough for a five year old to use."
164,00:12:12,00:12:13,Ouch.
165,00:12:13,00:12:14,He's okay. Thank God.
166,00:12:14,00:12:15,Good.
167,00:12:16,00:12:17,.32 caliber.
168,00:12:17,00:12:19,Not many of these in circulation.
169,00:12:19,00:12:21,"Well, that's a good thing."
170,00:12:21,00:12:22,Potentially.
171,00:12:22,00:12:23,(ammo rattling) Okay.
172,00:12:25,00:12:27,Here we go. Okay.
173,00:12:29,00:12:30,(gun clicks)
174,00:12:37,00:12:39,Two shots!
175,00:12:39,00:12:41,(metallic clunking)
176,00:13:01,00:13:04,There's showing up for work and there's doing your job.
177,00:13:04,00:13:06,Warrick brought in a .32 auto Coroner's bullet last week.
178,00:13:06,00:13:09,D.B. in Maslow Park.
179,00:13:09,00:13:12,You just found the murder weapon.
180,00:13:12,00:13:14,WILLOWS: Frank Maddox.
181,00:13:14,00:13:16,47-year-old white male.
182,00:13:16,00:13:18,He's a bounty hunter.
183,00:13:18,00:13:22,Single .32 round in the side of his head.
184,00:13:22,00:13:24,Bruises on his face and chest.
185,00:13:24,00:13:26,Autopsy ruled those premortem. At least a day old.
186,00:13:26,00:13:30,"It was a close shot, noncontact, downward angle."
187,00:13:30,00:13:32,No primer residue on the hands.
188,00:13:32,00:13:34,T.O.D. was approximately 2:00 a.m.
189,00:13:34,00:13:36,No one found the body until 7:00 a.m.
190,00:13:36,00:13:37,A lot of wind...
191,00:13:37,00:13:38,"Warrick, your notes are great."
192,00:13:39,00:13:40,Let the case speak for itself.
193,00:13:42,00:13:44,I got to go see my mummy.
194,00:13:52,00:13:55,"You know, I could've sworn I heard Grissom telling you to do this."
195,00:13:55,00:13:57,Yeah?
196,00:13:57,00:13:58,You know what rolls downhill?
197,00:13:58,00:14:01,Apparently bloated fingertips.
198,00:14:01,00:14:04,"Come on, you got a lot of new skills to master."
199,00:14:04,00:14:07,Field work's a little messier than your test tubes and your GCMS.
200,00:14:07,00:14:10,"Yeah, and a lot less accurate."
201,00:14:10,00:14:13,"One continuous motion, nice and easy."
202,00:14:17,00:14:20,That's not bad.
203,00:14:20,00:14:21,Keep practicing.
204,00:14:21,00:14:22,Nine more to go.
205,00:14:24,00:14:26,SIDLE: Hey. Hey.
206,00:14:26,00:14:27,I heard about your mummy in the closet.
207,00:14:27,00:14:29,Very cool.
208,00:14:29,00:14:30,"Yeah, and we get a 406 in Henderson."
209,00:14:30,00:14:31,Want to trade?
210,00:14:31,00:14:33,Nothing spells excitement like a B and E.
211,00:14:43,00:14:45,(knocking on door)
212,00:14:45,00:14:46,MAN: Who is it?
213,00:14:46,00:14:48,"OFFICER: Las Vegas Police, sir."
214,00:14:48,00:14:50,Hey.
215,00:14:50,00:14:53,We received a phone call from a neighbor about a break in.
216,00:14:54,00:14:55,"Yeah, yeah, I'm, uh, sorry, officers."
217,00:14:55,00:14:57,There's been a misunderstanding.
218,00:14:57,00:15:02,"My daughter, she had some friends over tonight without my permission, and, um, they started drinking."
219,00:15:02,00:15:03,They got out of control.
220,00:15:03,00:15:04,They broke some stuff.
221,00:15:04,00:15:09,"A couple of windows, but, uh, you know, we got it under control, we're cleaning it all up."
222,00:15:09,00:15:10,So I apologize for the trouble.
223,00:15:10,00:15:11,"OFFICER: No trouble at all, sir."
224,00:15:11,00:15:13,You have a good night now.
225,00:15:13,00:15:14,Thanks.
226,00:15:15,00:15:16,(Stokes sighs)
227,00:15:16,00:15:20,"""To protect and serve."" (chuckling)"
228,00:15:20,00:15:22,Are you boys ready for softball on Sunday?
229,00:15:22,00:15:24,"Ready to kick your ass, Stokes."
230,00:15:24,00:15:25,See you back at the lab.
231,00:15:25,00:15:27,All right. You're ready to kiss my what?
232,00:15:27,00:15:28,You heard me.
233,00:15:29,00:15:32,(Stokes and officer continue talking)
234,00:15:38,00:15:39,(gasps)
235,00:15:39,00:15:41,I need to go to the hospital.
236,00:15:41,00:15:43,Please.
237,00:15:45,00:15:47,"SIDLE: Suzanna, if you were sexually assaulted..."
238,00:15:48,00:15:49,It was a party.
239,00:15:49,00:15:50,It just got out of control.
240,00:15:50,00:15:55,All I need is an AIDS test and a morning after pill.
241,00:15:55,00:15:57,Date rape is still rape.
242,00:15:57,00:16:01,Thank you for clearing that up.
243,00:16:02,00:16:03,Hey.
244,00:16:03,00:16:05,Hi.
245,00:16:09,00:16:10,SUZANNA: Does she...?
246,00:16:10,00:16:13,Does she have to be in here for this?
247,00:16:13,00:16:15,No.
248,00:16:15,00:16:16,Bye.
249,00:16:16,00:16:18,Thank you.
250,00:16:18,00:16:20,Okay.
251,00:16:20,00:16:23,"Go ahead and put this on, okay?"
252,00:16:29,00:16:31,We're going to need full-body photographs.
253,00:16:31,00:16:34,"If she can't talk, the kit's going to have to do it for her."
254,00:16:34,00:16:35,Okay.
255,00:16:52,00:16:54,"Your, uh, mummy prints."
256,00:16:58,00:17:01,Warrick's getting sloppy.
257,00:17:01,00:17:04,"Yeah, someone should really have a talk with that guy."
258,00:17:06,00:17:08,What's that?
259,00:17:09,00:17:12,Dessert.
260,00:17:14,00:17:17,"MAN: Look, I thought we were done."
261,00:17:17,00:17:21,"STOKES: Well, sir, we need a list of all the kids who were here tonight."
262,00:17:21,00:17:22,Why?
263,00:17:22,00:17:26,"SIDLE: Mrs. Kirkwood, Mr. Kirkwood, your daughter has been raped."
264,00:17:26,00:17:27,(sighs)
265,00:17:27,00:17:29,What did she tell you?
266,00:17:33,00:17:35,We're going to need to search the premises.
267,00:17:35,00:17:37,You can't It's my house.
268,00:17:37,00:17:39,You don't have a choice. We have a warrant.
269,00:17:40,00:17:44,I'm going to have to ask you folks to step outside. Thank you.
270,00:17:48,00:17:49,I'll take the girl's room.
271,00:17:49,00:17:51,"Yeah, I'll take the master."
272,00:19:49,00:19:52,"So, how do we know we're dealing with the same suspect?"
273,00:19:52,00:19:54,We don't.
274,00:19:54,00:19:57,"Table against the closet door, chair shoved under the knob."
275,00:19:57,00:19:58,It is the same M.O.
276,00:19:58,00:20:00,Any connections between the victims?
277,00:20:00,00:20:03,"Well, both victims were left alive, we think."
278,00:20:03,00:20:08,"I mean, the old lady's death was probably unintentional, and the girl's rape was..."
279,00:20:08,00:20:10,Crime of opportunity?
280,00:20:11,00:20:14,"If you're out to rob somebody's house, why would you do it when they're home?"
281,00:20:14,00:20:19,GRISSOM: The difference between burglary and home invasion-- infliction of terror.
282,00:20:19,00:20:20,Talk to the cops?
283,00:20:20,00:20:23,"Say a word, and I'll kill you."
284,00:20:23,00:20:25,"I'll kill you, okay?"
285,00:20:25,00:20:28,"Bad guys leave, fear just stays behind."
286,00:20:31,00:20:33,WILLOWS: Maslow Park.
287,00:20:33,00:20:36,All fun and games till the sun goes down.
288,00:20:36,00:20:40,"So, the bounty hunter is here at 2:00 a.m."
289,00:20:40,00:20:42,Like shooting fish in a barrel.
290,00:20:42,00:20:47,Almost guaranteed to run into one of his skips or some lowlife who knows where they are.
291,00:20:47,00:20:50,"Well, apparently, someone found him first."
292,00:20:57,00:21:00,Hunter becomes the hunted.
293,00:21:01,00:21:04,A dozen perfect dump sites within a mile of here.
294,00:21:04,00:21:09,"So, how does the gun end up across town in the hands of a five-year-old boy?"
295,00:21:09,00:21:10,Drive and dump.
296,00:21:11,00:21:13,Doesn't make any sense.
297,00:21:25,00:21:27,"You never make it easy, do you?"
298,00:21:27,00:21:29,The center whorls look similar.
299,00:21:31,00:21:33,BROWN: Can you generate a composite?
300,00:21:33,00:21:35,"FRANCO: Well, it's all about gestalt."
301,00:21:36,00:21:39,When the whole of the pattern is greater than the sum of its parts.
302,00:22:35,00:22:38,"SIDLE: Once I pulled details, I shrank it back down to 100%."
303,00:22:38,00:22:40,Here's the thing.
304,00:22:40,00:22:43,Looks like the bite came from behind.
305,00:22:43,00:22:46,"Well, it was probably easier to subdue her in that position."
306,00:22:46,00:22:48,(terrified moaning and screaming)
307,00:22:52,00:22:54,You okay?
308,00:22:54,00:22:56,Yeah.
309,00:22:59,00:23:04,The occlusal plane looks the same.
310,00:23:04,00:23:06,And the lateral incisor overlaps the canine...
311,00:23:08,00:23:10,...in both cases.
312,00:23:10,00:23:11,Same person.
313,00:23:12,00:23:14,Definitely not the old lady's nephew.
314,00:23:15,00:23:16,"Hey, hey."
315,00:23:16,00:23:18,Two partials equal one slimeball.
316,00:23:18,00:23:20,Jacqui got a hit through AFIS.
317,00:23:20,00:23:23,The guy with the closet fixation is Steve Jansson.
318,00:23:23,00:23:25,Let's see if he has an oral fixation as well.
319,00:23:25,00:23:27,BRASS: Little Stevie Jansson.
320,00:23:27,00:23:31,"How was the Home of the Good Shepherd, Steve?"
321,00:23:31,00:23:34,Mac and cheese was aces.
322,00:23:34,00:23:36,Juvie offenses don't mean squat.
323,00:23:36,00:23:38,My record-- it's been expunged.
324,00:23:38,00:23:40,"Expunged, huh?"
325,00:23:40,00:23:42,"So, what's this crap you're pulling now?"
326,00:23:42,00:23:46,"SIDLE: Two crime scenes, two prints-- both yours."
327,00:23:46,00:23:51,"BRASS: And looking at your adult record, this makes strike two and three with one pitch."
328,00:23:51,00:23:52,That's a real time-saver for us.
329,00:23:52,00:23:55,I don't know what you're talking about.
330,00:23:55,00:23:56,Madeline Foster.
331,00:23:56,00:23:57,The Kirkwoods.
332,00:24:01,00:24:04,I do work for them sometimes.
333,00:24:05,00:24:06,Odd jobs.
334,00:24:06,00:24:11,"So, if we asked the Kirkwoods, they'd say you were their handyman, huh?"
335,00:24:11,00:24:14,Go ahead.
336,00:24:14,00:24:15,Ask them.
337,00:24:15,00:24:19,You always help yourself to something sweet while you work?
338,00:24:21,00:24:23,Bite it.
339,00:24:23,00:24:25,"MADDOX: I'm saying it now, and I'm saying it loud."
340,00:24:25,00:24:26,I will bring Terrango to justice.
341,00:24:26,00:24:30,INTERVIEWER: What makes you think you'll succeed where so many others have failed?
342,00:24:31,00:24:32,Failure's not an option.
343,00:24:32,00:24:33,It never has been.
344,00:24:33,00:24:35,"You feeling me, Terrango?"
345,00:24:35,00:24:38,"You can keep on running, but I will keep coming."
346,00:24:38,00:24:39,I will never stop.
347,00:24:39,00:24:41,Them's fightin' words.
348,00:24:41,00:24:42,Did he get his man?
349,00:24:42,00:24:43,"Actually, no."
350,00:24:43,00:24:48,"Terrango killed two more people before another ""recovery agent"" picked him up in Texas."
351,00:24:48,00:24:50,"Well, that probably hurt business."
352,00:24:51,00:24:52,"Oh, yeah, it did."
353,00:24:52,00:24:56,"After that case, his recovery rate went down practically to zero."
354,00:25:01,00:25:03,What about suicide?
355,00:25:03,00:25:04,No.
356,00:25:04,00:25:07,It's a non-contact wound at a downward angle.
357,00:25:07,00:25:08,It's a textbook murder.
358,00:25:08,00:25:09,Maybe too textbook.
359,00:25:09,00:25:11,A bounty hunter would know how to fake it.
360,00:25:11,00:25:14,Let's check out his right sleeve.
361,00:25:14,00:25:15,Very odd-- unbuttoned.
362,00:25:15,00:25:16,It's pulled way down.
363,00:25:16,00:25:19,It would explain why there weren't any prints on the gun.
364,00:25:24,00:25:27,Doesn't explain how the gun left the scene.
365,00:25:27,00:25:29,Maybe someone found it and grabbed it up.
366,00:25:29,00:25:31,Just to toss it in suburbia a week later?
367,00:25:31,00:25:33,We're always looking for a weapon.
368,00:25:33,00:25:36,You'd think it'd be easier when the weapon finds us.
369,00:25:36,00:25:38,What's in the scope?
370,00:25:38,00:25:39,It's polypropylene film.
371,00:25:40,00:25:41,It was found in the trigger guard.
372,00:25:42,00:25:45,"It's ribbon, for wrapping presents and..."
373,00:26:24,00:26:26,You got a theory?
374,00:26:26,00:26:28,You got ten bucks?
375,00:26:29,00:26:30,Yeah.
376,00:26:34,00:26:38,Jansson's dental impression is consistent with the bite mark on the girl's shoulder.
377,00:26:38,00:26:40,"Consistent, but not conclusive."
378,00:26:40,00:26:42,I spoke to Mr. Kirkwood.
379,00:26:42,00:26:45,He wouldn't confirm or deny Jansson's handyman story.
380,00:26:45,00:26:47,He said he couldn't remember.
381,00:26:47,00:26:48,"And without that, uh..."
382,00:26:48,00:26:50,"Hey, guys, we're screwed."
383,00:26:50,00:26:53,The semen from the rape kit doesn't belong to Steve Jansson.
384,00:26:53,00:26:54,No hits off CODIS either.
385,00:26:54,00:26:56,There was more than one guy.
386,00:26:56,00:26:57,She was gang-raped.
387,00:27:02,00:27:04,This gets cheerier by the minute.
388,00:27:04,00:27:06,Jansson's never going to roll over on his partner.
389,00:27:06,00:27:08,They're going to do it again.
390,00:27:08,00:27:09,Yeah.
391,00:27:09,00:27:11,We've given them no reason to stop.
392,00:27:13,00:27:15,(doorbell ringing)
393,00:27:20,00:27:21,Hi.
394,00:27:21,00:27:23,My name's Gil Grissom.
395,00:27:23,00:27:26,I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
396,00:27:28,00:27:30,"Suzanna, I said I'd get it."
397,00:27:31,00:27:33,What do you want?
398,00:27:33,00:27:37,I already told the police I have nothing more to say.
399,00:27:37,00:27:38,I think you do.
400,00:27:38,00:27:43,And I need you to speak for someone who can't speak for herself.
401,00:27:43,00:27:45,Another victim.
402,00:27:45,00:27:47,I don't care about another victim.
403,00:27:50,00:27:51,"Suzanna, please."
404,00:27:53,00:27:55,"Look, we know that two men broke into your house."
405,00:27:56,00:28:00,"We have one suspect in custody, but we can't hold him unless you talk to us."
406,00:28:00,00:28:01,I can't help you.
407,00:28:01,00:28:02,I'm shutting the door now.
408,00:28:02,00:28:04,"Mr. Kirkwood, I've done all that I can."
409,00:28:06,00:28:09,I need what you saw.
410,00:28:11,00:28:15,"Mr. Grissom, do you have a wife, children?"
411,00:28:17,00:28:18,No.
412,00:28:18,00:28:21,Then you can't possibly understand how I feel.
413,00:28:21,00:28:24,All I am to you is a folder in a drawer.
414,00:28:24,00:28:26,And if I had a wife and children...
415,00:28:26,00:28:27,Then you wouldn't be here.
416,00:28:29,00:28:30,I can't help you.
417,00:28:35,00:28:36,STOKES: Man...
418,00:28:37,00:28:38,Mrs. Kirkwood was a Hoover.
419,00:28:38,00:28:40,She even bleached the sheets.
420,00:28:40,00:28:41,You know what I don't get?
421,00:28:41,00:28:42,How do they get in?
422,00:28:42,00:28:45,There's no sign of forced entry at either scene.
423,00:28:45,00:28:47,Ring the doorbell; that usually seems to work.
424,00:28:50,00:28:52,"Hey, hey, hey. What?"
425,00:28:52,00:28:54,What is that you just threw over there?
426,00:28:54,00:28:57,"Leftovers, I guess."
427,00:28:57,00:29:03,BROWN: You know that piece of half-eaten shark with cake that Gris and I found at the old lady Maddie's house?
428,00:29:03,00:29:05,This is from the same restaurant.
429,00:29:05,00:29:07,Links the victims.
430,00:29:12,00:29:14,BROWN: Same night as the home invasion.
431,00:29:14,00:29:16,Signed by Mrs. Kirkwood.
432,00:29:17,00:29:20,Dinner for one.
433,00:29:20,00:29:24,"Single women, dining alone-- easy targets."
434,00:29:25,00:29:27,All you have to do is follow them home.
435,00:29:30,00:29:32,Same restaurant...
436,00:29:32,00:29:35,Same waiter?
437,00:29:39,00:29:41,Uh...
438,00:29:41,00:29:43,"sure, they're regulars."
439,00:29:43,00:29:48,"I haven't seen, uh, Maddie in a while, but Mrs. K. comes in every Thursday while her daughter's at soccer practice."
440,00:29:48,00:29:50,"Well, you know all your customers this well?"
441,00:29:50,00:29:52,I try to chat up the ones that come in alone.
442,00:29:52,00:29:53,I feel bad for 'em.
443,00:29:53,00:29:55,BROWN: So both women came in alone?
444,00:29:56,00:29:58,Every week.
445,00:29:58,00:30:00,Where were you after your shift on Thursday night?
446,00:30:00,00:30:03,"Oh, uh... I was best man at my friend's wedding."
447,00:30:04,00:30:05,The Luxor has that new wedding chapel.
448,00:30:06,00:30:08,You get it at a discount if you use it on a weekday.
449,00:30:08,00:30:10,I can give you a number if you...
450,00:30:10,00:30:12,"Down, boy."
451,00:30:12,00:30:13,Thanks.
452,00:30:13,00:30:14,Sure.
453,00:30:16,00:30:21,I kind of doubt that a clean-cut guy like Ryan is hanging out with snaggletooth Steve.
454,00:30:21,00:30:24,"No, but I'd bet somebody here was."
455,00:30:40,00:30:41,Hi. Hi.
456,00:30:41,00:30:43,You here every day?
457,00:30:43,00:30:45,"Seven days a week, till the sun goes down."
458,00:30:45,00:30:47,"I got a wife, a kid, and 2.3 dogs to support."
459,00:30:47,00:30:50,Do you recognize this man?
460,00:30:50,00:30:51,"Oh, yeah."
461,00:30:51,00:30:53,He was here a few days ago.
462,00:30:53,00:30:55,A little bigger than my average customer.
463,00:30:55,00:30:56,Did he buy any balloons?
464,00:30:56,00:30:59,Four big reds.
465,00:31:04,00:31:06,I'll take what he bought.
466,00:31:31,00:31:35,"So, we know Jansson's partner knew the customers at the restaurant."
467,00:31:35,00:31:39,"Education, employment history and a driver's license are required for all employees."
468,00:31:39,00:31:42,I've made a timeline of Steve Jansson's illustrious life span.
469,00:31:42,00:31:45,"Places he's lived, the places he's been arrested-- you know, the highlights."
470,00:31:46,00:31:48,You find any commonalities?
471,00:31:48,00:31:49,"Well, Eric Shultz."
472,00:31:49,00:31:51,Lives in the same neighborhood.
473,00:31:51,00:31:52,BROWN: Jose Cortez.
474,00:31:52,00:31:56,Worked at the Wilson Street Grill from '93 to '94.
475,00:31:56,00:32:03,"But the busboy, Kelly James-- not only went to the same high school, but graduated from the same juvie center."
476,00:32:03,00:32:06,SIDLE: It's always nice when they come out worse than when they went in.
477,00:32:06,00:32:09,"What do you think? That's our guy, right?"
478,00:32:09,00:32:10,GRISSOM: It's a connection.
479,00:32:11,00:32:12,It's not enough to compel DNA.
480,00:32:13,00:32:14,So we have nothing?
481,00:32:14,00:32:16,"No, we have a name, and we know where he works."
482,00:32:17,00:32:22,STOKES: I'll find out where he was the night the Kirkwoods were invaded. (pager beeps)
483,00:32:42,00:32:44,Lineup's almost ready to go.
484,00:32:44,00:32:50,"Listen, when she IDs Kelly James, we're going to need a DNA sample and an immediate hold, no bail."
485,00:32:50,00:32:52,He's not a flight risk.
486,00:32:52,00:32:53,He's a risk.
487,00:32:53,00:32:55,"SIDLE: Hey, Suzanna."
488,00:32:58,00:33:02,"Um, why don't we go hang out until they're ready for us?"
489,00:33:02,00:33:05,We'll get a glass of water or something.
490,00:33:07,00:33:12,I'm really glad you decided to come today.
491,00:33:19,00:33:22,Do you... you want to hear something stupid?
492,00:33:24,00:33:25,Sure.
493,00:33:31,00:33:36,My boyfriend and I had been talking about having sex for a of couple months.
494,00:33:38,00:33:44,I always said no because I was afraid that my parents would find out.
495,00:33:54,00:33:56,(sighs)
496,00:33:56,00:33:58,"Mr. Kirkwood, I'm sorry."
497,00:33:58,00:34:06,"The other day, I thought you were saying that you ""wouldn't"" help me, and now I realize that you couldn't."
498,00:34:08,00:34:10,I never got a good look at them.
499,00:34:14,00:34:15,We're ready.
500,00:34:15,00:34:17,Can she come with me?
501,00:34:17,00:34:21,BRASS: I already cleared it with the public defender.
502,00:34:24,00:34:26,She's 16.
503,00:34:26,00:34:34,"I only had two jobs left-- teach her to think for herself, keep her safe."
504,00:34:36,00:34:39,I got one right.
505,00:34:39,00:34:43,BRASS: Here's how this works: There are five guys in a line.
506,00:34:43,00:34:49,"We're going to ask each of them to step forward, turn to the side, and then face forward again."
507,00:34:49,00:34:53,"Now, if you want a second look or you need more time, just let us know."
508,00:34:53,00:34:59,"When you're ready to make a decision, write it down on this piece of paper."
509,00:34:59,00:35:02,"Remember, you can see them, but they can't see you."
510,00:35:02,00:35:05,Okay?
511,00:35:05,00:35:08,He already knows it's me.
512,00:35:08,00:35:10,"SIDLE: Suzanna, you can do this."
513,00:35:10,00:35:12,I know you can.
514,00:35:18,00:35:20,Okay.
515,00:35:22,00:35:26,"MAN (over intercom): Number One, please step forward."
516,00:35:26,00:35:29,Turn to the left.
517,00:35:29,00:35:32,Step back.
518,00:35:32,00:35:35,"Number Two, step forward. Turn to your left."
519,00:35:35,00:35:38,"MICHAEL: You know, people say you never forget."
520,00:35:38,00:35:43,Truth is... you do forget.
521,00:35:43,00:35:45,And then you remember.
522,00:35:45,00:35:48,It makes it worse.
523,00:35:48,00:35:55,"It was like, uh, it's like my brain... doesn't know where to put it."
524,00:35:55,00:35:58,(screaming)
525,00:35:58,00:36:00,(man yelling)
526,00:36:00,00:36:02,(crying and pleading)
527,00:36:02,00:36:06,"You know, it must've run through a million times in my mind..."
528,00:36:06,00:36:08,Somebody breaks in. I get a baseball bat.
529,00:36:08,00:36:11,Get everybody out the back door.
530,00:36:11,00:36:14,Call the cops. My family's safe.
531,00:36:19,00:36:21,And I just stood there...
532,00:36:26,00:36:29,"MAN (over intercom): Number Four, step forward."
533,00:36:44,00:36:45,Turn to your left.
534,00:36:52,00:36:53,(crying): No!
535,00:36:53,00:36:55,(screaming)
536,00:36:56,00:36:57,Suzanna! My baby!
537,00:37:01,00:37:13,"And when Suzanna was a little girl, Linda made me put those, um, the child-proof locks on all the kitchen cabinets."
538,00:37:13,00:37:15,I complained.
539,00:37:15,00:37:17,You know what she said to me?
540,00:37:17,00:37:32,"She said, uh, ""The least we can do is make her safe in her own house."" Mr. Kirkwood..."
541,00:37:32,00:37:34,you didn't do anything wrong.
542,00:37:34,00:37:37,(sighs)
543,00:37:39,00:37:41,(whispers): Baby.
544,00:37:42,00:37:46,"(sobbing quietly) Oh, it's okay, it's okay. Shh."
545,00:37:51,00:37:53,She froze up. She couldn't do it.
546,00:37:53,00:37:55,Her reaction should be enough.
547,00:37:55,00:37:56,What do you think?
548,00:37:56,00:38:01,"BRASS: Well, we've got enough to hold this Jansson kid, but the other guy..."
549,00:38:01,00:38:05,"Unless she writes a number down, there's nothing we can do."
550,00:38:11,00:38:12,Hey.
551,00:38:12,00:38:14,I'm sorry to hear about your case.
552,00:38:14,00:38:15,(sighs)
553,00:38:15,00:38:18,"We were so close, you don't even know."
554,00:38:18,00:38:21,"Well, he'll be back. We'll get him eventually."
555,00:38:21,00:38:22,Yeah.
556,00:38:23,00:38:25,Want to go for a ride?
557,00:38:26,00:38:29,Probably safer than anything else I had planned. Yeah.
558,00:38:32,00:38:36,Frank Maddox-- badass bounty hunter on his way down.
559,00:38:36,00:38:38,"Loses his rep, loses his edge..."
560,00:38:38,00:38:40,Loses his manhood.
561,00:38:40,00:38:43,Guess he thought he had nothing left to live for.
562,00:38:43,00:38:46,Except maybe one thing: going out with his boots on.
563,00:38:46,00:38:51,"He picks a known hot spot, and waits until it gets dark."
564,00:38:51,00:38:56,Angles the gun down... (gunshot)
565,00:38:56,00:39:00,And the balloons make it look like murder.
566,00:39:00,00:39:03,"BROWN: On a windy night, a balloon can go for miles."
567,00:39:03,00:39:05,Until...
568,00:39:15,00:39:20,"You leave the city to get away from crime, and guns fall out of the sky."
569,00:39:23,00:39:25,(classical music plays)
570,00:39:35,00:39:37,Get your kit.
