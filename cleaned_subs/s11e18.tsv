0	00:00:10	00:00:12	Oh, wow.
1	00:00:12	00:00:14	What? No. I...
2	00:00:14	00:00:15	I don't even want to say it.
3	00:00:15	00:00:17	I don't want to jinx it.
4	00:00:17	00:00:18	What are you talking about?
5	00:00:21	00:00:24	You guys playing freeze tag again?
6	00:00:24	00:00:28	Henry seems to be having a, uh, Beautiful Mind--moment here.
7	00:00:36	00:00:38	The cycle.
8	00:00:39	00:00:43	Yeah, I just closed a homicide, and I think Ray closed an accidental about an hour ago.
9	00:00:43	00:00:48	Well, there you go-- homicide, suicide, accidental. Gentlemen...
10	00:00:48	00:00:53	we here on grave shift, are one natural death away from hitting for the cycle.
11	00:00:53	00:00:55	I can't believe you; you said it.
12	00:00:56	00:00:57	So, what's your problem?
13	00:00:57	00:01:01	A guy's pitching a perfect game, you don't say-- he's pitching a perfect game.
14	00:01:01	00:01:03	Do you know how long it's been since grave hit a cycle?
15	00:01:03	00:01:08	Four years, seven months, 13 days, two hours and ten minutes.
16	00:01:08	00:01:11	Henry, we're men of science, not men of superstition.
17	00:01:11	00:01:15	Oh, my band of brothers, we will hit the cycle-- of this I am certain.
18	00:01:15	00:01:19	I am so certain that I propose a little action.
19	00:01:19	00:01:21	A little action, huh?
20	00:01:21	00:01:27	Yeah. Let's do it. A wager to see which CSI brings in the natural, and thereby brings the cycle home.
21	00:01:27	00:01:28	It's luck of the draw.
22	00:01:28	00:01:29	You can't predict who's going to pull a natural.
23	00:01:29	00:01:32	It's a numbers game-- the more cases you get, the more chances you have to win.
24	00:01:32	00:01:35	And, uh, I'm on a roll, right now, boys.
25	00:01:35	00:01:36	I wouldn't bet against me.
26	00:01:36	00:01:41	Or me. I got a body, right now, in autopsy, that's looking pretty au naturel.
27	00:01:41	00:01:42	I got a hundred bucks on Nick.
28	00:01:42	00:01:45	And it's not because you are the co-shift supervisor.
29	00:01:45	00:01:47	Thank you. I am also...
30	00:01:47	00:01:49	in on me for $100. You know what?
31	00:01:49	00:01:51	Uh, make it $200.
32	00:01:52	00:01:52	Like a man...
33	00:01:53	00:01:55	All right, I'm in.
34	00:01:55	00:01:57	Yeah, and Hodges, let Henry be the bank.
35	00:01:57	00:02:01	What, you don't trust me with our future earnings?
36	00:02:01	00:02:02	(wry laugh) Come on.
37	00:02:02	00:02:04	This is so wrong.
38	00:02:04	00:02:08	You don't just shove dollar bills into the Holy Grail, you know.
39	00:02:08	00:02:10	That's true, Henry.
40	00:02:11	00:02:13	But this is Vegas.
41	00:02:13	00:02:16	Uh, we have a cycle going on, people!
42	00:02:16	00:02:17	Anybody else want in?
43	00:02:17	00:02:18	Go see Henry.
44	00:02:18	00:02:19	Easy money, Sanders.
45	00:02:19	00:02:21	It's like picking it up off the ground.
46	00:02:21	00:02:22	Yeah, well, don't hurt yourself.
47	00:02:22	00:02:24	Oh, come on!
48	00:02:24	00:02:26	No... Seriously?
49	00:03:02	00:03:03	Abdomen is distended.
50	00:03:03	00:03:05	Hard to the touch.
51	00:03:05	00:03:06	She's not pregnant.
52	00:03:06	00:03:08	Tumor, maybe?
53	00:03:08	00:03:10	That would be a natural.
54	00:03:10	00:03:12	Maybe the chick's just fat.
55	00:03:12	00:03:15	Stuffing her face with Twinkies and chalupas.
56	00:03:15	00:03:19	Wouldn't be the first. You'll have to excuse Kevin, my new assistant-- transfer from L.A.
57	00:03:19	00:03:22	Just used to hotter-looking corpses, Doc.
58	00:03:24	00:03:26	Ah, that's gross. It's pus, Kevin. Beaker.
59	00:03:26	00:03:27	That is a lot of pus.
60	00:03:27	00:03:30	And one serious infection.
61	00:03:30	00:03:33	Question is, what caused it?
62	00:03:33	00:03:34	Infection.
63	00:03:34	00:03:36	That would be a natural, right?
64	00:03:36	00:03:38	Would you give the cycle a rest for a second, please?
65	00:03:38	00:03:40	It's, uh...
66	00:03:40	00:03:45	when you get a homicide, accidental, suicide, and natural death, all in the same shift.
67	00:03:46	00:03:49	Kind of like banging a white chick, black chick, Mexican and Asian chick all in one night, right?
68	00:03:51	00:03:53	Been there. Oof.
69	00:03:53	00:03:56	The colon appears punctured.
70	00:03:56	00:03:57	Did you say she die at her desk?
71	00:03:57	00:03:58	I did.
72	00:03:58	00:04:02	People like to chew on office supplies while they're working.
73	00:04:02	00:04:03	Swallow them.
74	00:04:03	00:04:06	So... paper clip.
75	00:04:06	00:04:07	Accidents happen.
76	00:04:07	00:04:09	Definitely not a natural.
77	00:04:10	00:04:11	Sorry to burst two bubbles.
78	00:04:11	00:04:15	419.
79	00:04:15	00:04:18	Well, where there is death, there's hope.
80	00:04:27	00:04:28	Hey, hey.
81	00:04:28	00:04:31	Welcome to the apocalypse.
82	00:04:31	00:04:35	Aeron's Legion.--Sweet. Meet DV8Avenger.
83	00:04:37	00:04:38	Huh! Nice chair.
84	00:04:38	00:04:42	So, at 4 from LeftBrain528, in Vancouver.
85	00:04:42	00:04:48	He was concerned because his buddy was AFK for the past five hours. AFK?
86	00:04:48	00:04:49	It's away from keyboard.
87	00:04:49	00:04:51	It's a gamer thing.
88	00:04:51	00:04:54	DV8's real name is Steven Pyles.
89	00:04:54	00:04:55	Unfortunate name.
90	00:04:55	00:04:56	You guys smell that?
91	00:04:56	00:04:58	Check under the blanket.
92	00:05:01	00:05:02	Um... (clears throat)
93	00:05:02	00:05:04	Mr. Pyles is wearing a diaper.
94	00:05:04	00:05:05	Guy's a serious gamer.
95	00:05:05	00:05:08	No time for bathroom breaks.
96	00:05:08	00:05:09	Right. Didn't want to be AFK.
97	00:05:09	00:05:10	Well, good luck with this.
98	00:05:10	00:05:11	I'm out of here.
99	00:05:14	00:05:17	Whoo! Sorry we're late to the party.
100	00:05:17	00:05:19	Grandma here was driving.
101	00:05:20	00:05:22	Oh, God, it reeks in here.
102	00:05:22	00:05:24	This isn't too good for my hangover.
103	00:05:24	00:05:26	Have you all met Kevin? Yeah.
104	00:05:26	00:05:28	Yeah, we've had the pleasure.
105	00:05:33	00:05:35	Oh, you think?
106	00:05:35	00:05:40	pepperoni pizza, hot wings, French fries-- I'm just gonna go out on a limb here...
107	00:05:40	00:05:43	and say that, uh, Moby Dick stroked out.
108	00:05:44	00:05:45	Congrats.
109	00:05:45	00:05:47	Got your natural.
110	00:05:47	00:05:49	Oh, Well, I guess we can all go home then.
111	00:05:49	00:05:54	I don't know how you do things in L.A., but in Vegas, we wait for autopsy.
112	00:05:54	00:05:56	Yeah, you could do that.
113	00:06:03	00:06:05	86 degrees-- it's odd.
114	00:06:05	00:06:10	Based on lividity, I'd say T.O.D. was six to eight hours ago.
115	00:06:10	00:06:11	Body temp should be higher than that, right?
116	00:06:11	00:06:12	More like 91 degrees.
117	00:06:12	00:06:15	Could be the AC, or the guy just runs cold.
118	00:06:15	00:06:16	Doesn't rule out a natural.
119	00:06:16	00:06:19	No, but it also doesn't rule out a homicide.
120	00:06:20	00:06:23	I guess we should get to work.
121	00:06:23	00:06:25	Sucks.
122	00:06:33	00:06:35	Gardener found the body.
123	00:06:35	00:06:38	Homeowners are on vacation in Europe.
124	00:06:38	00:06:40	Victim was house-sitting.
125	00:06:40	00:06:41	We got an I.D.?
126	00:06:41	00:06:44	Benjamin Fowler,age 39.
127	00:06:44	00:06:49	Supposedly, the guy just went through a divorce, and was just crashing here.
128	00:06:49	00:06:51	Come on.
129	00:07:08	00:07:09	Forced entry.
130	00:07:09	00:07:11	Yeah, looks like it.
131	00:07:13	00:07:14	I have a shoe impression here.
132	00:07:14	00:07:16	Herringbone pattern.
133	00:07:19	00:07:22	Glass still in the window frame and on the ground.
134	00:07:22	00:07:26	Radial fracture, right angle, rear side.
135	00:07:26	00:07:29	This window was broken from the outside in.
136	00:07:33	00:07:34	Dead bolt still works.
137	00:07:35	00:07:37	So...
138	00:07:37	00:07:41	the perp tried to kick the door open, it wouldn't budge...
139	00:07:41	00:07:44	So he breaks a window, reaches in and unlocks the dead bolt.
140	00:07:53	00:07:55	Whoo!
141	00:07:55	00:07:57	No TV. No tunes.
142	00:07:57	00:07:59	Somebody got ripped off.
143	00:07:59	00:08:02	Victim wanders into a robbery, gets himself killed.
144	00:08:02	00:08:04	Straight-up robbery-homicide.
145	00:08:04	00:08:05	Works for me.
146	00:08:05	00:08:07	Now, where the hell is Super Dave?
147	00:08:07	00:08:11	Man, I want to get this one wrapped up; get back in the game.
148	00:08:12	00:08:15	So this is DV8Avenger.
149	00:08:15	00:08:19	From what Sara said, I'm glad you got that diaper off.
150	00:08:19	00:08:22	I had my new assistant do it.
151	00:08:22	00:08:23	Kevin. Mmm.
152	00:08:23	00:08:26	Well, it's a perfect job for that guy.
153	00:08:26	00:08:29	So, uh, you got any C.O.D. on the gamer?
154	00:08:29	00:08:33	Well, our victim's gullet was congested with vomitus.
155	00:08:33	00:08:36	Undigested food. Mmm. What is that?
156	00:08:36	00:08:38	Pepperoni? With onions.
157	00:08:38	00:08:40	Our friend's unhealthy habits caught up to him.
158	00:08:40	00:08:43	But it wasn't his heart that gave out.
159	00:08:43	00:08:44	What was it?
160	00:08:44	00:08:46	His stomach.
161	00:08:46	00:08:50	Our victim experienced a violent regurgitation.
162	00:08:50	00:08:58	Generally speaking, when someone reacts to a choking gag-reflex, undigested food will be hurled back up and be expelled through the mouth and nose.
163	00:08:58	00:09:00	In this case, that didn't happen.
164	00:09:00	00:09:03	Our victim succumbed to food being trapped in the vocal folds.
165	00:09:03	00:09:04	Asphyxiation.
166	00:09:04	00:09:15	Kind of like what happened with Mama Cass, and choking on her ham sandwich. Actually, the coroner's inquest found Cass Elliot died from fatty myocardial degeneration, due to obesity.
167	00:09:15	00:09:16	There was no obstruction.
168	00:09:16	00:09:18	Well, at least Mama was a natural.
169	00:09:18	00:09:20	Ah, yes-- the cycle.
170	00:09:20	00:09:22	How much is the pot up to now?
171	00:09:22	00:09:23	It's a couple grand.
172	00:09:23	00:09:24	Crazy, right?
173	00:09:24	00:09:26	Mm. How much you in for?
174	00:09:26	00:09:27	$200. On whom?
175	00:09:27	00:09:32	Nobody. I mean, most people die of natural causes, without suspicious circs-- we don't roll on them.
176	00:09:32	00:09:35	So, I'm betting that we are not going to be hitting for the cycle.
177	00:09:35	00:09:43	Well, you are a smart lady, which is why you're probably asking, how was our victim unable to expel the vomitus?
178	00:09:43	00:09:44	And I have an answer.
179	00:09:45	00:09:52	These healed contusions along the tongue say that our victim appears to have had a history of seizures.
180	00:09:52	00:09:53	Seizures caused by what?
181	00:09:54	00:09:56	I haven't had a chance to review his medical records yet.
182	00:09:56	00:10:00	All I know is that a seizure would've been a major contributor to his death.
183	00:10:00	00:10:03	Guess what I found in DV8's apartment-- carbamazepine.
184	00:10:03	00:10:06	Anticonvulsant used to treat epilepsy.
185	00:10:06	00:10:13	You know, I read a case about a person diagnosed with epilepsy who suffered a seizure while playing a video game.
186	00:10:13	00:10:15	You think a video game killed our vic?
187	00:10:15	00:10:18	Preexisting condition, but death brought on by external circumstances.
188	00:10:18	00:10:22	You know, I hate to say it, but the needle's tipping from natural to accidental.
189	00:10:23	00:10:26	So the cycle takes a backseat, but it's still speculation.
190	00:10:26	00:10:30	I mean, we have no way of knowing what happened to DV8 after he went AFK.
191	00:10:30	00:10:31	Actually, there is.
192	00:10:31	00:10:35	Serious gamers don't just wear diapers, they also record their games.
193	00:10:35	00:10:39	Like chess players, they want to review their moves and learn from their mistakes.
194	00:10:39	00:10:41	We did pulls all the hard drives from his apartment.
195	00:10:41	00:10:46	I'll look through them, see if I can find a recording of our victim's virtual death.
196	00:11:48	00:11:51	Yo, dude, what the hell?
197	00:11:51	00:11:52	There could be biologicals on that gun.
198	00:11:52	00:11:54	You just can't put it into plastic.
199	00:11:54	00:11:56	Yeah, I don't need a forensics lesson there, Mr. Wizard.
200	00:11:56	00:11:58	The serial number's etched off. I'm going to let it air dry.
201	00:11:58	00:12:01	I'm not putting it in the bag, I'm putting it on the bag.
202	00:12:01	00:12:02	Believe it or not, I know what I'm doing.
203	00:12:02	00:12:04	Whatever.
204	00:12:09	00:12:11	Dr. Langston, I presume.
205	00:12:12	00:12:15	You're the fella who crossed swords with Nate Haskell.
206	00:12:15	00:12:18	Saw you on America's Most Wanted.
207	00:12:18	00:12:20	Cool.
208	00:12:20	00:12:22	Kevin! Gurney!
209	00:12:22	00:12:24	Now!
210	00:12:24	00:12:26	Kevin, do this, Kevin, do that.
211	00:12:26	00:12:30	I'm getting sick to my stomach with your crap.
212	00:12:30	00:12:32	Hey, don't...
213	00:12:35	00:12:36	What was that?
214	00:12:36	00:12:39	I'm sorry. He's from L.A.
215	00:12:39	00:12:40	That explains it.
216	00:12:40	00:12:44	Wrists are bound, overhand knot.
217	00:12:44	00:12:46	That cord is from inside the house.
218	00:12:46	00:12:47	Restraints are loose.
219	00:12:47	00:12:50	He probably tried to set himself free.
220	00:12:50	00:12:52	Contusions on his face.
221	00:12:52	00:12:54	What appears to be a broken nose.
222	00:12:54	00:12:55	All signs of blunt-force trauma.
223	00:12:55	00:12:57	That's not what killed him, though.
224	00:12:57	00:13:00	It was a single GSW to the back of the head.
225	00:13:00	00:13:01	Can't find the exit wound.
226	00:13:01	00:13:03	It's probably still holding.
227	00:13:03	00:13:05	More than likely the bullet's still in his head.
228	00:13:05	00:13:07	Yeah...
229	00:13:10	00:13:12	No cash. It's consistent with robbery.
230	00:13:12	00:13:16	So Mr. Fowler interrupts a burglary.
231	00:13:16	00:13:17	There's a struggle.
232	00:13:17	00:13:19	The killer punches him, ties him up.
233	00:13:19	00:13:21	Then Fowler makes a break for it.
234	00:13:21	00:13:24	The killer follows after him, shoots--him in the back of the head.
235	00:13:26	00:13:28	What do you think, new girlfriend?
236	00:13:28	00:13:34	Personal experience says it's probably his ex-wife.
237	00:13:34	00:13:35	He's still wearing his wedding ring.
238	00:13:49	00:13:50	Taking a break?
239	00:13:52	00:13:55	Reliving the last exploits of DV8Avenger.
240	00:13:55	00:14:01	Guy kept recordings of all his games, including the final two minutes of the last game he ever played.
241	00:14:01	00:14:04	Now DV8 was not just playing Aeron's Legion--solo.
242	00:14:04	00:14:06	He was playing MMORPG.
243	00:14:06	00:14:07	English?
244	00:14:07	00:14:10	Massively multiplayer on line role-playing game.
245	00:14:10	00:14:14	Meaning there a lot of people playing against him.
246	00:14:14	00:14:16	That is a lot of people.
247	00:14:16	00:14:17	Well, it's Aeron's Legion.
248	00:14:17	00:14:25	See, we're talking 34th century, when all of humanity has been whittled down to a small but contentious band of warriors called the Descendants.
249	00:14:25	00:14:26	Mm-hmm.
250	00:14:26	00:14:32	The point is, you've got all these weapons, but the only one that you don't want to use is the flash-bang.
251	00:14:32	00:14:36	Excellent distraction, but takes major points off your score. Greg...
252	00:14:36	00:14:38	All right, well, during DV8's last game, Uh-huh.
253	00:14:38	00:14:42	one player pulled a radical move and just started unloading with flash-bangs.
254	00:14:42	00:14:44	54 in just one minute.
255	00:14:44	00:14:46	A move like that just deducts points from your score.
256	00:14:47	00:14:48	You don't gain a single point.
257	00:14:48	00:14:52	Unless the point is to give your opponent a seizure.
258	00:14:52	00:14:54	A type of attack like this would do it.
259	00:14:55	00:15:09	The strobing imagery in the game generated a photosensitive reaction, which produced impulses that traveled through the optic nerve and into the temporal lobe of the brain-- frying the circuits, triggering an epileptic seizure.
260	00:15:09	00:15:10	Who launched the attack?
261	00:15:15	00:15:17	NinjaAssassin.
262	00:15:18	00:15:24	So if NinjaAssassin knew that DV8 was epileptic, and intentionally triggered a seizure, we're looking at a homicide.
263	00:15:35	00:15:40	Geeks and freaks, give it up for Cyber Bowl 2011!
264	00:15:42	00:15:46	Aeron's Legion Semi Number One pits two hot-wired warriors.
265	00:15:46	00:15:52	First, Las Vegas native, and future Hall of Gamer, NinjaAssassin!
266	00:16:01	00:16:03	Hi-yah!
267	00:16:03	00:16:04	Game on, gamers!
268	00:16:04	00:16:06	Whoo! Let's do this!
269	00:16:06	00:16:08	I think we found our assassin.
270	00:16:13	00:16:14	These people need to get a life.
271	00:16:14	00:16:15	I think you'd like video games.
272	00:16:16	00:16:17	You get to shoot people.
273	00:16:17	00:16:22	When I was their age, I was on a real battlefield with a real weapon in a real jungle.
274	00:16:22	00:16:25	I don't need to play war with my thumbs.
275	00:16:25	00:16:32	And uploading from San Juan, Puerto Rico, The rico suave of gaming, last year's rookie of the year, Murd3er-1.
276	00:16:40	00:16:42	You know what the winner of this takes home?
277	00:16:42	00:16:43	100 grand.
278	00:16:43	00:16:46	100 G's?
279	00:16:46	00:16:47	Now I want to shoot someone.
280	00:16:47	00:16:49	Fire up your controllers.
281	00:16:49	00:16:51	It's game on, bitches.
282	00:16:58	00:17:00	Okay, let's go.
283	00:17:05	00:17:06	Las Vegas police.
284	00:17:08	00:17:10	Hold on, guys.
285	00:17:10	00:17:11	Get outta here, man!
286	00:17:11	00:17:14	Game's over... bitches.
287	00:17:24	00:17:27	Am I in some kind of trouble?
288	00:17:27	00:17:31	This isn't about the Girls Gone Wild file share, is it?
289	00:17:33	00:17:37	You, uh, you know this guy, Ninja?
290	00:17:37	00:17:39	Oh, man!
291	00:17:39	00:17:41	Who filleted DV8Avenger?
292	00:17:41	00:17:43	No wonder he didn't show up for the semi.
293	00:17:43	00:17:45	Dude, put that thing away.
294	00:17:45	00:17:48	So you can toss fake grenades at a guy, but you can't stomach seeing what it did to him?
295	00:17:48	00:17:51	What are you talking about?
296	00:17:51	00:17:54	DV8Avenger was playing against you when he died.
297	00:17:54	00:17:55	Virtually.
298	00:17:55	00:17:56	I didn't actually kill him.
299	00:17:56	00:18:01	I-I mean I have killed him on the fields of Crador.
300	00:18:02	00:18:03	Though, admittedly, he had the edge.
301	00:18:03	00:18:04	Hey, real world.
302	00:18:04	00:18:07	Did DV8 ever mention to you that he had a medical condition?
303	00:18:07	00:18:09	He had a lot of conditions.
304	00:18:10	00:18:11	Yeah, like epilepsy.
305	00:18:11	00:18:13	Did you know that?
306	00:18:13	00:18:15	Kind of.
307	00:18:18	00:18:22	2009, El Paso finals, I saw DV8 popping pills.
308	00:18:22	00:18:24	Figured they were uppers.
309	00:18:24	00:18:26	Told him I was going to the judges...
310	00:18:26	00:18:28	Yeah, and he told you they were his epilepsy meds.
311	00:18:28	00:18:34	And you kind of knew that all the flash-bangs you threw at him would trigger a seizure.
312	00:18:34	00:18:35	Look, I'm an athlete. I'm a competitor.
313	00:18:35	00:18:37	I was looking for an edge.
314	00:18:37	00:18:38	I get it.
315	00:18:38	00:18:39	100 grand.
316	00:18:39	00:18:42	You can't die from a seizure. That's a fact.
317	00:18:42	00:18:44	I looked it up. It's on WikiMeds.
318	00:18:44	00:18:46	I think you're gonna kind of need a lawyer.
319	00:18:48	00:18:51	Hey, Doc. I know, I know, you want a quick C.O.D.
320	00:18:51	00:18:54	so you can get out of the pits and get back into the race.
321	00:18:54	00:18:55	It's not just me, man.
322	00:18:55	00:18:57	I got a lot of people riding on me.
323	00:18:57	00:18:59	Yeah, well, for the record, I am not among them. Oh, yeah?
324	00:19:00	00:19:01	Well, who'd you put your money on, Greg?
325	00:19:01	00:19:03	You might as well just give it to me right now.
326	00:19:03	00:19:07	I hold my cards close to the vest and my cash even closer.
327	00:19:07	00:19:09	Yeah, yeah, okay. What's up with this guy?
328	00:19:09	00:19:13	I found these fibers in his chompers.
329	00:19:13	00:19:15	They match the restraints on his wrists.
330	00:19:15	00:19:18	He was probably trying to undo that knot with his teeth.
331	00:19:21	00:19:22	Mr. Fowler's X-rays.
332	00:19:22	00:19:26	Extensive damage to the cervical vertebrae and the occipital bone.
333	00:19:26	00:19:27	You see the beveling?
334	00:19:28	00:19:30	Inside to out.
335	00:19:30	00:19:33	So the bullet went out the back of his head.
336	00:19:33	00:19:36	We initially thought that exit wound was an entry wound.
337	00:19:36	00:19:39	The real entry wound is in the oral pharynx.
338	00:19:40	00:19:44	No soot around the hole, so he was shot from at least three feet away. Mouth open.
339	00:19:44	00:19:46	No!
340	00:19:47	00:19:50	It's a penetrating wound.
341	00:19:50	00:19:51	Through and through.
342	00:19:51	00:19:54	Okay, so the bullet's got to be back at the house.
343	00:19:54	00:19:58	Well, if you're lucky, you might catch a natural on the way over.
344	00:20:12	00:20:14	Thanks.
345	00:20:14	00:20:17	I'm very sorry for you loss, Mrs. Fowler.
346	00:20:17	00:20:19	What happened to Ben?
347	00:20:19	00:20:23	He was house-sitting for some friends.
348	00:20:23	00:20:24	There was a break-in.
349	00:20:24	00:20:26	He was shot.
350	00:20:26	00:20:29	The house in Seven Hills? The Alexanders' place?
351	00:20:29	00:20:30	You know them?
352	00:20:30	00:20:32	They were friends, before the divorce.
353	00:20:33	00:20:36	People choose sides, you know how that goes.
354	00:20:36	00:20:39	Yes, I do.
355	00:20:39	00:20:42	Tell me...
356	00:20:42	00:20:44	when was the last time you saw Ben?
357	00:20:44	00:20:46	Just a couple of days ago.
358	00:20:46	00:20:48	He got pulled over for DUI.
359	00:20:48	00:20:50	He called me, I bailed him out.
360	00:20:50	00:20:52	I took him back to the house.
361	00:20:52	00:20:53	I got to go.
362	00:20:54	00:20:55	I just poured you a glass of wine.
363	00:20:55	00:20:56	Come on, stay, please?
364	00:20:57	00:20:59	I'm tired. I don't want to do this anymore.
365	00:20:59	00:21:01	You won't have to, I promise.
366	00:21:03	00:21:05	(both gasp) Ah, shoot!
367	00:21:05	00:21:08	I'm sorry. You know, what, next time, just call somebody else.
368	00:21:08	00:21:10	Olivia, please wait. You're all I got.
369	00:21:14	00:21:19	I was the last person in the world that he could call and I turned my back on him.
370	00:21:20	00:21:22	Sounds like he was in a pretty dark place.
371	00:21:22	00:21:24	He wasn't always.
372	00:21:24	00:21:26	He lost his contracting business.
373	00:21:26	00:21:29	Couldn't find another job.
374	00:21:29	00:21:31	Started drinking, gambling.
375	00:21:31	00:21:33	It got out of hand.
376	00:21:33	00:21:38	I filed, he left.
377	00:21:38	00:21:42	I thought when the Alexanders' took him in that he'd be okay.
378	00:21:42	00:21:44	I just wish I could take back what I said.
379	00:21:44	00:21:47	I never did stop loving him.
380	00:22:06	00:22:10	Why didn't you find the bullet the first time?
381	00:22:10	00:22:13	We thought it was still in him.
382	00:22:14	00:22:15	Are you questioningmy work?
383	00:22:15	00:22:17	I've got one large riding on you.
384	00:22:18	00:22:18	Relax.
385	00:22:19	00:22:22	It's got to be in the pool.
386	00:22:22	00:22:25	Oh, no-- I'm having a good hair day.
387	00:22:28	00:22:31	Well, maybe neither one of us has to get wet.
388	00:22:31	00:22:32	No!
389	00:22:53	00:23:00	A little ballistics, a little case closed, and then Team Stokes is on the hunt for the elusive natural.
390	00:23:00	00:23:02	Go, Stokes.
391	00:23:02	00:23:04	A little faith, baby.
392	00:23:07	00:23:09	Ah, here to lay down some more action?
393	00:23:09	00:23:11	Actually, I'm here for my tox results.
394	00:23:11	00:23:17	Right. Found sleeping pills in your gamer's bloodstream-- Zolpidem.
395	00:23:17	00:23:18	High therapeutic levels.
396	00:23:18	00:23:22	A gamer on Zolpidem?!
397	00:23:22	00:23:25	That's like a sumo wrestler on diet pills.
398	00:23:25	00:23:29	Yeah. Listen, thanks to you guys, I'm really busy here.
399	00:23:29	00:23:33	The point is, your victim was staring at the inside of his eyelids when those flash-bangs were going off.
400	00:23:33	00:23:35	So NinjaAssassin's off the hook.
401	00:23:35	00:23:39	So, why would a hardcore gamer pound sedatives the night before the big game?
402	00:23:39	00:23:41	Maybe someone spiked his joystick.
403	00:23:41	00:23:43	Can you solve this someplace else?
404	00:23:43	00:23:47	What about his stomach contents?
405	00:23:47	00:23:49	Yeah, it just went to the top of my stack.
406	00:23:49	00:23:52	I'll have it in twenties.
407	00:23:52	00:23:53	Or 20 minutes.
408	00:23:53	00:23:55	Forget it.
409	00:24:22	00:24:25	I just got flowers from one of the day shift guys.
410	00:24:26	00:24:27	Does he know you're married?
411	00:24:27	00:24:28	Yeah.
412	00:24:28	00:24:30	He was wishing me luck in the cycle.
413	00:24:30	00:24:34	Henry found Zolpidem in our vic's system.
414	00:24:34	00:24:37	I'm guessing this is how it got into there.
415	00:24:37	00:24:43	You know, I did find a prescription bottle for Zolpidem in the trash, but it belonged to somebody else, and there was still a few pills in it.
416	00:24:43	00:24:46	I couldn't collect it because there was no direct link to the case.
417	00:24:46	00:24:47	Did you get a pic?
418	00:24:47	00:24:48	I did.
419	00:24:57	00:24:59	(sighs) Label got wet.
420	00:25:01	00:25:04	But I think I can still scan the bar code.
421	00:25:11	00:25:13	Bottle belonged to an Evan Ferrari.
422	00:25:13	00:25:20	All right, well, based on DV8's social calendar, my bet is that Mr. Ferrari is also a gamer.
423	00:25:33	00:25:36	It's like finding a nerd in a haystack.
424	00:25:38	00:25:39	Maybe she can help.
425	00:25:47	00:25:48	Excuse me.
426	00:25:52	00:25:53	I'm with the Crime Lab.
427	00:25:53	00:25:55	Yeah, I remember you.
428	00:25:55	00:25:58	And your sidekick, Commander Buzz Kill.
429	00:25:58	00:26:01	Listen, sugarbug, we're looking for Evan Ferrari.
430	00:26:01	00:26:04	So if you don't want another buzz kill, just point him out to me.
431	00:26:08	00:26:09	The blonde.
432	00:26:14	00:26:15	That's Evan Ferrari?
433	00:26:19	00:26:21	Sweet ride.
434	00:26:27	00:26:30	(sniffles) I knew something was wrong.
435	00:26:30	00:26:33	I kept calling him, but no answer.
436	00:26:33	00:26:36	But then when he didn't show up to the semifinals...
437	00:26:36	00:26:38	poor Stevie.
438	00:26:40	00:26:42	Did he have a heart attack?
439	00:26:43	00:26:45	How well did you know Stevie?
440	00:26:45	00:26:47	He was my boyfriend.
441	00:26:47	00:26:48	Really?
442	00:26:49	00:26:52	I'm sorry for your loss.
443	00:26:53	00:26:56	We found your Zolpidem in his apartment.
444	00:26:56	00:26:57	How many pills did you give him?
445	00:26:57	00:26:59	What?
446	00:26:59	00:27:04	You crushed up his pills, spiked his drink and put him to sleep forever.
447	00:27:04	00:27:06	I didn't crush any pills.
448	00:27:06	00:27:08	The only thing that I had a crush on was Stevie.
449	00:27:08	00:27:10	He had trouble sleeping.
450	00:27:10	00:27:11	He was a gamer and...
451	00:27:12	00:27:21	there was always someone on line that was ready to thumble, and he just could never back down, so, sometimes I would give him sleeping pills, but never more than the recommended dosage.
452	00:27:21	00:27:23	I think you're lying.
453	00:27:23	00:27:31	And I think big Stevie got nervous when his fine Italian sports car girlfriend was strutting her stuff for a thousand amped-up geeks.
454	00:27:33	00:27:35	conventions, fight nights.
455	00:27:35	00:27:36	It pays the bills.
456	00:27:37	00:27:38	And Stevie knew that.
457	00:27:38	00:27:40	He liked a woman with her own career.
458	00:27:40	00:27:41	You're a cyber league girl.
459	00:27:41	00:27:43	You don't make a lot of money.
460	00:27:43	00:27:49	So maybe some nerd offered to pay you to dose Stevie, knock him out of the tournament and share some of the prize money with you.
461	00:27:49	00:27:51	No, I would never do that.
462	00:27:51	00:27:53	I loved Stevie.
463	00:27:53	00:27:58	And for the record, I didn't need his money or anyone else's.
464	00:27:58	00:28:05	I make enough off my looks to have anything that I could ever want-- except for a man who can see past them.
465	00:28:08	00:28:12	So, the pot on the cycle is up to four grand if you want to get in on this.
466	00:28:12	00:28:14	If I want to gamble, I'll go to a casino.
467	00:28:14	00:28:17	Fair enough.
468	00:28:17	00:28:19	I got back DNA on the blood from the house.
469	00:28:19	00:28:20	Two contributors.
470	00:28:21	00:28:24	One was our victim, the other an unknown male.
471	00:28:24	00:28:26	I may be able to help there.
472	00:28:26	00:28:28	I ran the prints.
473	00:28:28	00:28:37	Most came back to our victim Ben Fowler, a few unknowns, but we did get one hit Carl Jansen.
474	00:28:37	00:28:42	Nice rap sheet-- burglary, larceny, assault.
475	00:28:42	00:28:43	Did you check with PD?
476	00:28:44	00:28:46	Yes. He's a loan shark.
477	00:28:46	00:28:52	I also checked our victim's phone records, and you can see, that our loan shark has been calling him.
478	00:28:52	00:28:53	Calling him a lot.
479	00:28:53	00:28:57	Mm-hmm. Well, Carl doesn't look like somebody you want to owe money to.
480	00:29:01	00:29:09	These are your fingerprints, this is your blood, and I'm guessing that's your gun.
481	00:29:09	00:29:11	Used to shoot Ben Fowler.
482	00:29:11	00:29:13	How much did he owe you?
483	00:29:13	00:29:15	All right, Carl, come on now.
484	00:29:15	00:29:19	You save us a little time here, we might be able to return the favor.
485	00:29:19	00:29:20	Does that line ever really work?
486	00:29:20	00:29:21	Actually, it does.
487	00:29:21	00:29:23	It did with Armin Kosh.
488	00:29:23	00:29:26	Yeah, when you get out of the joint, I'd suggest finding yourself a new fence.
489	00:29:26	00:29:28	Your boy gave you up real quick.
490	00:29:28	00:29:31	He paid you $3,000 for the items that you stole from the Alexander house.
491	00:29:31	00:29:33	After you put a slug in Ben's head and dumped him in the pool.
492	00:29:33	00:29:37	Sounds like I need to have a little talk with Armin.
493	00:29:37	00:29:39	Threatening to kill someone in front of a cop?
494	00:29:39	00:29:40	That's not real smart.
495	00:29:40	00:29:42	I don't kill people.
496	00:29:42	00:29:44	Dead people don't make me money.
497	00:29:46	00:29:50	It's my blood, my prints.
498	00:29:50	00:29:52	I was there... to collect.
499	00:29:52	00:29:55	Just give me till Tuesday.
500	00:29:55	00:29:56	Tuesday, huh?
501	00:29:59	00:30:00	Are you sure you won't forget?
502	00:30:00	00:30:02	Because I think you're gonna forget.
503	00:30:02	00:30:04	(groans) I swear I won't.
504	00:30:04	00:30:07	I think you will. That's why we're gonna settle right now.
505	00:30:07	00:30:09	Take the TV...
506	00:30:10	00:30:11	take everything.
507	00:30:12	00:30:13	Guy owes me money.
508	00:30:14	00:30:17	Now, the way this works, he's gonna owe me more money.
509	00:30:17	00:30:20	You want to hook me up for stealing a TV?
510	00:30:20	00:30:22	Go ahead.
511	00:30:22	00:30:24	That's all you got.
512	00:30:27	00:30:30	Wow-- Kevin, charming.
513	00:30:31	00:30:31	I hate him...
514	00:30:32	00:30:34	to the very core of my being.
515	00:30:34	00:30:35	Oh, I hear you.
516	00:30:35	00:30:39	I don't even want to tell you what he just said to me in the washroom, but do me a favor.
517	00:30:39	00:30:42	and take a good look at the D.B. Thank you.
518	00:30:46	00:30:49	Dude, I'm rolling a natural here.
519	00:30:49	00:30:51	I told CSI Redhead I'm putting five large on her.
520	00:30:51	00:30:53	I'm gonna score and then I'm gonna score.
521	00:30:53	00:30:59	If you think for one second that Catherine would actually lower herself-- There's no way this old lady didn't die of old age.
522	00:31:05	00:31:07	Paramedics found her on the stairs.
523	00:31:15	00:31:16	Dude, that's my corpse.
524	00:31:16	00:31:17	Shh.
525	00:31:17	00:31:19	Hear that crepitis sound?
526	00:31:19	00:31:21	She has osteoporosis.
527	00:31:21	00:31:24	Yeah, Grey's Anatomy,-- she's old.
528	00:31:24	00:31:28	Well, the injury indicates that she probably fell and fractured her femur; caused a blood clot.
529	00:31:28	00:31:30	No way her death was a natural.
530	00:31:30	00:31:31	It was an accident.
531	00:31:31	00:31:33	Can we just keep this between us?
532	00:31:33	00:31:35	No.
533	00:31:38	00:31:42	Diagnose this, Quincy-- why does my head ache the more I'm around you?
534	00:31:52	00:31:55	Hey, got an AG waiver on Evan Ferrari's phone and ISP.
535	00:31:55	00:31:59	Our cyber league girl wasn't kidding about loving DV8.
536	00:31:59	00:32:02	If anything, she might have loved him a little too much.
537	00:32:02	00:32:04	Find another beer belly to rub. DV8's mine.
538	00:32:04	00:32:08	Text DV8 again and your phone will blow off your fingers.
539	00:32:08	00:32:09	Do gamers have groupies?
540	00:32:09	00:32:12	Haven't you seen The Social Network?
541	00:32:12	00:32:15	Hey, bank. Hope you got my stomach contents there.
542	00:32:16	00:32:17	Look, I'm really sorry I fell a little behind.
543	00:32:18	00:32:20	I can't believe I got roped into being everybody's bookie.
544	00:32:20	00:32:23	So, your gamer didn't just have Zolpidem in his system.
545	00:32:23	00:32:27	The extended tox panel says Emetine.
546	00:32:27	00:32:29	Hm. Primary alkaloid in ipecac.
547	00:32:29	00:32:31	Used to induce vomiting.
548	00:32:31	00:32:36	If you knock somebody out with Zolpidem, and then feed him a pizza with ipecac...
549	00:32:36	00:32:38	Hello Jimmy Hendrix, good-bye DV8.
550	00:32:38	00:32:40	He chokes to death on his vomit.
551	00:32:40	00:32:42	So, Evan's pissed at her boyfriend for doing a little groupie-grabbing.
552	00:32:42	00:32:44	What do you got for me, LeftBrain?
553	00:32:44	00:32:46	You walked right into my trap.
554	00:32:46	00:32:49	She mixes him a nightcap.
555	00:32:49	00:32:53	Don't think I don't need to see you behind that rock to kill you.
556	00:32:53	00:32:54	There you are.
557	00:32:58	00:32:59	Adds in some special sauce.
558	00:32:59	00:33:02	Looks like you could use a midnight snack, baby.
559	00:33:09	00:33:10	I buy it.
560	00:33:10	00:33:11	But how do you prove it?
561	00:33:11	00:33:13	Well, we still have her bottle of Zolpidem.
562	00:33:14	00:33:15	Now we can actually print it.
563	00:33:15	00:33:16	I'll go get it.
564	00:33:16	00:33:17	And I'll print the pizza box.
565	00:33:18	00:33:21	If she served him his last meal, that puts the pizza in her hand.
566	00:33:50	00:33:52	Pizza, pizza.
567	00:33:53	00:33:55	Sorry. I had to.
568	00:33:55	00:33:57	What are you delivering, Greg?
569	00:33:57	00:34:00	Oh, just our prime suspect.
570	00:34:00	00:34:02	Sara and I ran prints on the pizza box and Zolpidem bottle.
571	00:34:02	00:34:08	Both came back to a work card for a Monica Gimble-- better known as DJ Drang.
572	00:34:08	00:34:11	She's working the Cyber Bowl-- the emcee.
573	00:34:11	00:34:16	For a big guy in a diaper, DV8 sure knew how to attract some killer babes.
574	00:34:22	00:34:24	So you were moonlighting as a pizza delivery girl.
575	00:34:24	00:34:26	Excuse me?
576	00:34:26	00:34:30	Well, you delivered a pizza to DV8Avenger the night he choked and croaked... didn't you?
577	00:34:30	00:34:32	So I delivered a pizza to a friend.
578	00:34:32	00:34:35	The man liked to eat.
579	00:34:35	00:34:36	No, I understand.
580	00:34:36	00:34:37	Hey, listen, I love pizza, you know?
581	00:34:37	00:34:38	I'm from the East Coast.
582	00:34:38	00:34:39	I like it, you know, I like New York style pizza.
583	00:34:39	00:34:44	You know, I never had a pizza to go that had ipecac on it?
584	00:34:44	00:34:45	It must be a Vegas thing.
585	00:34:45	00:34:48	You know, ipecac, you gotta get it from an on line pharmacy.
586	00:34:48	00:34:49	and you gotta use your credit card.
587	00:34:49	00:34:51	And you used your credit card.
588	00:34:51	00:34:54	So, we got you for the ipecac.
589	00:34:54	00:34:57	And the lab guys told me it was combined with a drug called Zolpidem.
590	00:34:57	00:35:00	And here's where it gets a little salacious.
591	00:35:00	00:35:04	Your fingerprints are on the bottle, and Evan Ferrari's name is on the script.
592	00:35:04	00:35:06	So we know you know her.
593	00:35:07	00:35:09	The question is how well?
594	00:35:10	00:35:12	We're just friends.
595	00:35:12	00:35:14	Just friends with benefits?
596	00:35:14	00:35:20	We thought you were in on it together until we read the e-mail where she dumped you.
597	00:35:20	00:35:22	You were girlfriend and girlfriend.
598	00:35:23	00:35:25	You shared everything; you shared the Zolpidem.
599	00:35:25	00:35:28	But you didn't share her newfound taste in men, right?
600	00:35:32	00:35:36	I thought she was going through some weird experimental phase.
601	00:35:36	00:35:38	Yeah, I know what you mean, I saw the guy. Right?
602	00:35:38	00:35:44	I mean, if you're going to go join the other team, at least make it a model or a jock, not... Jabba the Hutt.
603	00:35:44	00:35:48	The bastard even threw it in my face.
604	00:35:48	00:35:51	How his thumbs had given her more pleasure than she'd ever known.
605	00:35:51	00:35:52	So he had to go.
606	00:35:52	00:35:55	I loved Evan, and he stole her from me.
607	00:35:55	00:35:59	And then he's about to win the Cyber Bowl, walk away with a hundred grand?
608	00:35:59	00:36:00	He didn't deserve any of that.
609	00:36:00	00:36:02	So you spiked his pizza and his soda.
610	00:36:02	00:36:06	I knew the fat pig couldn't turn down free food and a little come-on.
611	00:36:06	00:36:08	Double bonus!
612	00:36:08	00:36:11	I just wanted to wish you luck.
613	00:36:11	00:36:13	Want some company?
614	00:36:21	00:36:26	I thought, fat guy, stuffing his face, chokes on his own vomit...
615	00:36:26	00:36:27	who's going to investigate that?
616	00:36:27	00:36:28	Let me guess.
617	00:36:28	00:36:30	Me?
618	00:36:36	00:36:39	Hey, Catherine, I ran ballistics on our bullet.
619	00:36:39	00:36:42	It came from the gun in the pool, but the gun's not in the system.
620	00:36:42	00:36:45	Well, it's not like we expected loan shark Carl to get sloppy.
621	00:36:45	00:36:48	So I got a call from the Alexanders' insurance adjustor.
622	00:36:48	00:36:53	He accounted for all of the electronics that Carl boosted from the house, but there was one additional item missing-- a sculpture.
623	00:36:53	00:36:55	Is it valuable?
624	00:36:55	00:36:59	Worth about ten grand, so Vice talked to Carl's fence, he never saw it, and PD's canvassing pawn shops.
625	00:37:00	00:37:01	We'll see what we get. All right.
626	00:37:02	00:37:05	This case will just not die a natural death.
627	00:37:05	00:37:08	I pulled some very interesting trace from your gun.
628	00:37:08	00:37:12	Uh, more specifically, from the front sight-- human tissue.
629	00:37:12	00:37:13	The killer's?
630	00:37:13	00:37:18	Unfortunately for Nick's and my apparently ill-advised wager, it belongs to the victim.
631	00:37:19	00:37:20	Tissue from his tongue.
632	00:37:20	00:37:23	So the killer shoved the gun into Fowler's mouth.
633	00:37:23	00:37:24	That's not possible.
634	00:37:24	00:37:26	There was no GSR around the wound.
635	00:37:26	00:37:27	Maybe Fowler was shot underwater?
636	00:37:31	00:37:33	Sorry, boss. It's just a theory.
637	00:37:33	00:37:36	I mean, we're all under a lot of pressure here, but...
638	00:37:36	00:37:45	All right, so, if you found tissue from the victim's tongue on the sight, that means that not only was the gun inside his mouth, but that it was upside-down.
639	00:37:45	00:37:50	And a gun in this position, looks more like suicide than murder.
640	00:37:50	00:37:54	Which is consistent with Ben Fowler's state of mind.
641	00:37:54	00:37:56	Divorced, in debt...
642	00:37:56	00:37:57	What about the break-in?
643	00:37:57	00:38:00	The guy was tied up and dumped in the pool.
644	00:38:00	00:38:02	You saying it was staged? No.
645	00:38:02	00:38:04	The evidence is saying it.
646	00:39:08	00:39:12	The shoeprint on the door was a match to a pair of Ben Fowler's shoes.
647	00:39:12	00:39:20	So, he kicks in the door, punches a hole in the window, then tries to make it all look like a break-in.
648	00:39:20	00:39:23	Doc Robbins found rope fibers in the victim's teeth.
649	00:39:23	00:39:26	And Hodges proved that it is possible to tie yourself into knots.
650	00:39:30	00:39:34	So he wasn't trying to loosen his restraints, he was trying to tighten them.
651	00:39:34	00:39:35	Apparently.
652	00:39:37	00:39:44	And when he fired the gun underwater, the flames were extinguished, which explains why there was no GSR in his mouth.
653	00:39:44	00:39:48	Now why would he go through so much trouble to make a suicide look like a homicide?
654	00:39:48	00:39:50	Because he wanted to make amends.
655	00:39:50	00:39:54	Look, the man's life was in pieces.
656	00:39:54	00:39:57	He's divorced, he'd gotten pulled over for a DUI.
657	00:39:57	00:39:59	His ex-wife had to come bail him out.
658	00:39:59	00:40:00	That couldn't have felt good.
659	00:40:00	00:40:02	Then Carl Jansen beats him up.
660	00:40:03	00:40:12	And while he's watching Carl and his thugs tear apart his friend's home, maybe Ben thought there was a way for him to be a man again, to be a husband, a provider.
661	00:40:13	00:40:17	The pawnshop owner I.D.'d Ben the morning of his death.
662	00:40:17	00:40:22	Said he came into shop and pawned the sculpture.
663	00:40:22	00:40:23	A thousand bucks.
664	00:40:23	00:40:25	A million, actually.
665	00:40:25	00:40:27	What do you mean? Ben didn't take the cash.
666	00:40:27	00:40:31	He had the pawnshop wire the money to an insurance company.
667	00:40:32	00:40:33	Life insurance.
668	00:40:34	00:40:36	Had a million dollar policy.
669	00:40:36	00:40:42	He was behind on some of the payments, but he used the money from the sculpture to pay off the remaining balance.
670	00:40:43	00:40:46	He killed himself so I could have the money?
671	00:40:46	00:40:48	You said you never stopped loving him.
672	00:40:48	00:40:49	Well, clearly, he never stopped loving you.
673	00:40:52	00:41:00	You know, when a man lets his wife down, loses her...
674	00:41:00	00:41:02	sometimes he can lose himself.
675	00:41:06	00:41:13	When your marriage fails, what no one tells us is that it makes us feel like we've failed somehow.
676	00:41:15	00:41:17	I'm not sure who failed who.
677	00:41:26	00:41:28	Last body of the shift.
678	00:41:28	00:41:30	Dare I ask?
679	00:41:30	00:41:31	Homicide.
680	00:41:32	00:41:34	Liquor store robbery. Single GSW.
681	00:41:34	00:41:36	So much for hitting the cycle.
682	00:41:36	00:41:43	Unbelievable. It's one shift, five homicides, two suicides, three accidentals, not a single natural.
683	00:41:43	00:41:47	All it takes is old age, heart attack, stroke, aneurysm.
684	00:41:48	00:41:50	Well, you and Kevin get our vic washed up and prepped.
685	00:41:50	00:41:52	Then go home.
686	00:41:52	00:41:53	Got it.
687	00:41:56	00:41:59	Kevin.
688	00:41:59	00:42:02	Wake. Up.
689	00:42:02	00:42:04	Kevin! I need help!
690	00:42:04	00:42:06	Okay, you are such a sack of...
691	00:42:13	00:42:14	Doc?
692	00:42:14	00:42:20	David, don't be a snitch, just wake him up so I can fire him.
693	00:42:20	00:42:22	Uh, he's dead.
694	00:42:22	00:42:24	Yeah, he said he had a headache.
695	00:42:24	00:42:26	He's been popping aspirin all day.
696	00:42:26	00:42:27	Thought he was hung over.
697	00:42:30	00:42:31	Blown pupil.
698	00:42:31	00:42:33	Aneurysm.
699	00:42:33	00:42:35	Well, there's your natural.
700	00:42:35	00:42:36	We completed the cycle.
701	00:42:37	00:42:39	Yeah. But nobody won.
702	00:42:39	00:42:40	Au contraire.
703	00:42:40	00:42:41	I did.
704	00:42:41	00:42:44	You found the body, did you not?
705	00:42:44	00:42:46	Yeah. So? My money was on you.
706	00:42:46	00:42:50	Most natural deaths aren't investigated by CSI.
707	00:42:51	00:42:53	But when a body drops, you're always there.
708	00:42:53	00:42:56	Even when the body drops in your lap.
709	00:42:56	00:42:58	Sorry, Kevin.
710	00:43:01	00:43:03	Uh, are you calling 911?
711	00:43:04	00:43:05	No, I'm calling Henry.
