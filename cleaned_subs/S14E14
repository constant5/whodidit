0,00:00:05,00:00:07,(woman speaking Spanish)
1,00:00:10,00:00:13,The sweetest little girl you've ever seen.
2,00:00:20,00:00:22,BOY: Ana is the only girl I ever asked out.
3,00:00:22,00:00:24,"She said no, but still..."
4,00:00:24,00:00:26,(voices murmuring)
5,00:00:29,00:00:31,Kid was a force of nature.
6,00:00:31,00:00:34,"She'd come into my class laughing, and just... light up the room."
7,00:00:35,00:00:37,She will not be forgotten.
8,00:00:37,00:00:38,Al...
9,00:00:40,00:00:41,Thank you for coming.
10,00:00:43,00:00:44,Can we have a word?
11,00:00:44,00:00:46,Of course. Of course.
12,00:00:48,00:00:52,"ROBBINS: I am so sorry for your loss, Gabriel."
13,00:00:52,00:00:56,And I apologize; I still haven't heard quite what happened.
14,00:00:56,00:01:01,"I didn't want to keep the news of Ana's death from her friends and family, but there are certain details of it which..."
15,00:01:01,00:01:03,remain unclear.
16,00:01:03,00:01:09,"Three days ago, Ana was discovered dead in the border city of Arquero, Mexico."
17,00:01:09,00:01:14,"The local coroner found her license on her, notified LVPD..."
18,00:01:14,00:01:20,"calling her death ""drug-related."" They sent these photos and prints to confirm it was Ana."
19,00:01:20,00:01:25,But he's been otherwise uncooperative and refused to arrange transport of the body to Las Vegas.
20,00:01:26,00:01:28,Has he performed an autopsy?
21,00:01:28,00:01:31,I demanded that he not proceed with one.
22,00:01:31,00:01:36,"He's wrong about Ana doing drugs, and I don't want him getting anything else wrong."
23,00:01:36,00:01:37,Al...
24,00:01:37,00:01:39,I want you to go to Arquero.
25,00:01:39,00:01:41,Determine how my daughter died.
26,00:01:43,00:01:45,Gabriel...
27,00:01:45,00:01:48,that... that's not something that I can do.
28,00:01:48,00:01:51,"No, no, no, you must!"
29,00:01:51,00:01:53,As my friend.
30,00:01:53,00:01:56,Please.
31,00:01:56,00:01:58,"Since Carmen's passing, Ana was all I had."
32,00:02:00,00:02:03,I need you to make sense of what has happened to her.
33,00:02:05,00:02:07,She was a good girl.
34,00:02:10,00:02:12,"I've been to Arquero, Mexico."
35,00:02:12,00:02:14,For business.
36,00:02:15,00:02:18,There's no reason Ana should have been down there.
37,00:02:18,00:02:21,In that wretched place.
38,00:02:24,00:02:26,"Please, Al."
39,00:02:28,00:02:31,Tell me what happened to my Ana.
40,00:02:34,00:02:36,Okay.
41,00:02:36,00:02:38,I'll see what she can tell us.
42,00:03:14,00:03:16,"All right, well... thanks for your help."
43,00:03:16,00:03:18,"Yeah, yeah, not a problem."
44,00:03:18,00:03:19,"Hey, Greg."
45,00:03:19,00:03:20,Hey.
46,00:03:20,00:03:25,Landlord came over to collect the month's rent from the couple who lives here.
47,00:03:25,00:03:29,Came across this when he looked through the garage window.
48,00:03:34,00:03:35,Wow.
49,00:03:35,00:03:37,That's one hell of a body dump.
50,00:03:37,00:03:39,Like they were dumped by a cement truck.
51,00:03:39,00:03:41,Got this picture from inside.
52,00:03:41,00:03:43,I'm pretty sure this is the couple.
53,00:03:43,00:03:45,Brett and Claire Marsh.
54,00:03:45,00:03:47,Someone's been doing a lot of work in here.
55,00:03:47,00:03:53,SANDERS: Landlord says that Brett had repaired the sewer line and was in the middle of replacing the floor.
56,00:03:53,00:03:56,"Yeah, but concrete's not quicksand."
57,00:03:56,00:03:58,They couldn't have just gotten stuck in it.
58,00:03:58,00:04:01,"No, I'm thinking that someone was trying to bury these two."
59,00:04:01,00:04:04,"PHILLIPS: And the ground just vomited them up, huh?"
60,00:04:04,00:04:05,"Yeah, because someone messed up the recipe."
61,00:04:05,00:04:10,"A couple of these empty bags are expansive mortar. It looks like concrete, but it's actually designed to bust up concrete."
62,00:04:10,00:04:15,You pour it into drilled holes and it'll grow to such a volume that it can crack solid rock.
63,00:04:15,00:04:24,"The stuff is mistakenly mixed with the concrete, gets poured on the couple, and then the dead shall rise."
64,00:04:27,00:04:29,Beyond bizarre.
65,00:04:29,00:04:33,"David, I can help you chip them out for transport back to the morgue."
66,00:04:33,00:04:34,That would be great. Thanks.
67,00:04:34,00:04:36,"All right, I'll get started processing inside the house."
68,00:04:36,00:04:38,"OFFICER: Sir, hold up. MAN: I live here."
69,00:04:38,00:04:39,"This is a crime scene. I live here, all right?"
70,00:04:39,00:04:41,"This is my house, all right?! Whoa, hey."
71,00:04:41,00:04:42,I live here! Hold on a second.
72,00:04:42,00:04:43,What the hell is going on?
73,00:04:45,00:04:47,Brett Marsh?
74,00:04:47,00:04:48,Yeah.
75,00:04:48,00:04:49,I'm CSI Sanders.
76,00:04:49,00:04:51,I'm with the crime lab. Claire?
77,00:04:52,00:04:53,"Oh, my God."
78,00:04:55,00:04:57,She's dead?
79,00:04:57,00:04:58,I'm so sorry.
80,00:05:01,00:05:02,BRETT: Is that Jeff?
81,00:05:09,00:05:11,My wife and my brother Jeff.
82,00:05:11,00:05:13,I was only away in Bakersfield for a night.
83,00:05:13,00:05:15,What the hell happened to them?
84,00:05:15,00:05:17,You said that your brother was doing your cement work?
85,00:05:19,00:05:22,He needed a place to stay.
86,00:05:22,00:05:24,So I let him crash.
87,00:05:27,00:05:31,"And I knew he'd screw it up, the kind of guy Jeff is..."
88,00:05:31,00:05:35,"but I was expecting sloppy edgework, not..."
89,00:05:35,00:05:37,that.
90,00:05:41,00:05:43,Do you know anyone who'd want to hurt your brother?
91,00:05:43,00:05:44,Or your wife?
92,00:05:48,00:05:51,All right. We're gonna figure out who did this.
93,00:05:56,00:05:58,"RUSSELL: Oh, there he is."
94,00:05:58,00:05:59,"Hola, amigo."
95,00:05:59,00:06:00,You ready for this?
96,00:06:00,00:06:03,"Took a little convincing with my wife, but, uh, I'm clear."
97,00:06:03,00:06:05,"RUSSELL: Good. You're clear internationally, too."
98,00:06:05,00:06:10,Mexican Federal Police are gonna have an agent meet you at the airport and then escort you throughout the entire trip.
99,00:06:10,00:06:11,"Yeah, it's this agent right here."
100,00:06:11,00:06:16,"His name's, uh, Javier Silva. He'll be like our own personal Federale, right?"
101,00:06:16,00:06:19,And Nick's gonna liaise any evidence you find during the autopsy.
102,00:06:19,00:06:21,"And act as my translator, por favor?"
103,00:06:21,00:06:23,"Well, it's been a while, but I'll do my best."
104,00:06:23,00:06:28,"Oh, boy. RUSSELL: All right, look, I know I don't have to tell you guys this, but that part of the border..."
105,00:06:28,00:06:29,it's like the Wild West.
106,00:06:29,00:06:32,So you do your thing and then come right back.
107,00:06:32,00:06:36,"Sounds good. Besides, what could go wrong?"
108,00:06:45,00:06:47,Ahh!
109,00:06:48,00:06:52,"I don't suppose they're too strict about speed limits here, Agent Silva?"
110,00:06:52,00:06:57,"The way cops work in Arquero, be lucky if it's a radar gun they are pointing at you."
111,00:06:57,00:07:00,"Yeah, I've been reading up on the situation down here."
112,00:07:00,00:07:03,The war between the drug cartels is really heating up.
113,00:07:03,00:07:06,"And from what I understand, local police are in the cartel's pocket."
114,00:07:06,00:07:07,Am I right?
115,00:07:07,00:07:12,And one thing all sides agree on: they despise outside law enforcement.
116,00:07:12,00:07:15,Americans or Federales.
117,00:07:15,00:07:16,Great.
118,00:07:31,00:07:32,That's the place?
119,00:07:54,00:07:56,Dr. Blanco?
120,00:07:56,00:07:58,Sí.
121,00:07:58,00:07:59,(speaking Spanish)
122,00:07:59,00:08:03,"I'm Dr. Al Robbins, pathologist from the Las Vegas coroner."
123,00:08:03,00:08:07,"Las Vegas? STOKES: Sí. Yo soy Nick Stokes, con Las Vegas PD."
124,00:08:07,00:08:08,This is about that girl?
125,00:08:10,00:08:12,"Yes, sir. Ana Ortiz."
126,00:08:12,00:08:16,What kind of budget do you have to work with out there in Las Vegas? I'm sorry?
127,00:08:16,00:08:21,"You can travel the world, just to be told in person, go away?"
128,00:08:26,00:08:27,"I told you, amigo."
129,00:08:27,00:08:29,ROBBINS: Dr. Blanco. Dr. Blanco.
130,00:08:29,00:08:33,"We're not trying to invade your territory, sir."
131,00:08:39,00:08:41,Dr. Blanco...
132,00:08:41,00:08:45,if you'll just allow me to examine the body-- please.
133,00:08:45,00:08:48,I've already told her father what happened to her.
134,00:08:48,00:08:56,"I will autopsy her once I'm finished with those that have been waiting longer. SILVA: Dr. Blanco, federal agencies are prepared to intervene if necessary, so I suggest..."
135,00:08:56,00:08:57,(speaks Spanish)
136,00:09:02,00:09:04,The body's in cold storage.
137,00:09:04,00:09:07,Drains are backed up.
138,00:09:08,00:09:10,There's the bucket.
139,00:09:10,00:09:11,Thank you.
140,00:09:11,00:09:13,Are there other staff here?
141,00:09:13,00:09:18,"Just me. STOKES: Wait a minute, you handle over a thousand murders a year by yourself?"
142,00:09:18,00:09:21,"In a good year, yes."
143,00:09:21,00:09:23,That's insane.
144,00:09:23,00:09:26,There's only one body that you're worried about.
145,00:09:26,00:09:27,She wasn't murdered.
146,00:09:30,00:09:34,"Anonymous caller, uh, saw her by the side of the road in the middle of nowhere."
147,00:09:34,00:09:35,I picked her up.
148,00:09:35,00:09:40,"I found cocaine inside her nostrils, all over her hair, her dress-- overdose."
149,00:09:40,00:09:42,She has no history of drug use.
150,00:09:42,00:09:45,Says who? Says me.
151,00:09:45,00:09:46,(chuckles)
152,00:09:51,00:09:55,"You know, I'm starting to get the feeling he doesn't want us around."
153,00:10:23,00:10:25,Hey. Hey.
154,00:10:25,00:10:27,"So, I had Dr. Blanco give me Ana's clothes."
155,00:10:27,00:10:29,There was no butcher paper.
156,00:10:29,00:10:33,So local news is going to have to do here.
157,00:10:39,00:10:40,Everything all right?
158,00:10:40,00:10:43,Ana's father wanted some answers.
159,00:10:43,00:10:45,He's not gonna like them.
160,00:10:45,00:10:48,"Her hair is thinning, she has sores on her mouth."
161,00:10:48,00:10:50,The signs of sustained drug use.
162,00:10:50,00:10:57,The degree of damage to the liver and kidneys is further evidence consistent with her being a serious long-term drug user.
163,00:10:57,00:10:58,And her father had no idea?
164,00:10:58,00:11:00,I don't think so.
165,00:11:02,00:11:06,We'll express-ship a sample of her heart blood to Vegas.
166,00:11:06,00:11:08,Lab can run a drug panel.
167,00:11:08,00:11:12,Blanco also gave me a sample of the cocaine trace he found in her nose and hair.
168,00:11:12,00:11:14,So we'll check that out.
169,00:11:14,00:11:16,What's going on with her feet?
170,00:11:16,00:11:17,Are you seeing this?
171,00:11:17,00:11:22,"Well, it sounds kind of strange, but the tissue damage is consistent with frostbite."
172,00:11:22,00:11:25,Frostbite?
173,00:11:25,00:11:28,In a town where the morgue doesn't drop below 50 degrees?
174,00:11:28,00:11:29,You got me.
175,00:11:34,00:11:37,"Whoa, there's traces of cornhusk all over this dress."
176,00:11:42,00:11:44,"Don't worry, Doc, we'll find out exactly what happened to her."
177,00:11:44,00:11:45,I hope so.
178,00:11:45,00:11:47,Okay?
179,00:11:54,00:11:56,Hey. Hey.
180,00:11:56,00:12:00,This is definitely Claire Marsh and her husband's brother Jeff.
181,00:12:02,00:12:05,Single GSWs to their heads?
182,00:12:05,00:12:08,"Through and through on his, no exit wound on hers."
183,00:12:08,00:12:10,Expansive mortar did the rest of this damage.
184,00:12:10,00:12:13,"Well, Finn is X-raying the rest of the concrete now."
185,00:12:13,00:12:18,"She thought she saw an embedded bullet, which means they were shot in the garage."
186,00:12:18,00:12:20,Right beside their shallow grave.
187,00:12:20,00:12:25,"But the concrete expanded and shifted, so we won't be able to determine anything about the bullet's trajectory."
188,00:12:25,00:12:27,(Sidle grunts)
189,00:12:31,00:12:32,Greg.
190,00:12:32,00:12:33,Look at this.
191,00:12:33,00:12:34,A gun.
192,00:12:34,00:12:36,Possible murder weapon?
193,00:12:36,00:12:40,"You know, I found some antidepressants among Jeff's stuff at the house."
194,00:12:40,00:12:44,"Guy has emotional problems, ends up with a gun in his hand?"
195,00:12:44,00:12:45,You're thinking murder-suicide.
196,00:12:45,00:12:48,Wouldn't be the first guy to covet his brother's wife.
197,00:12:48,00:12:49,He wants to off himself.
198,00:12:49,00:12:51,Decides to take her with him.
199,00:12:51,00:12:57,"So, he shoots her, pours the concrete, and then snuggles up beside her in the concrete."
200,00:12:57,00:12:59,Bam.
201,00:12:59,00:13:01,It's a possibility.
202,00:13:01,00:13:03,Actually it's not.
203,00:13:03,00:13:07,I found high-velocity blood spatter on Claire's clothing.
204,00:13:07,00:13:09,Wrong side to be from her GSW.
205,00:13:09,00:13:14,"So it was his, which means she was standing out of the concrete next to him when he was shot."
206,00:13:14,00:13:18,"My theory--double murder, killer plants the gun, buries them."
207,00:13:18,00:13:20,Occam's razor is so dull.
208,00:13:29,00:13:31,Okay.
209,00:13:31,00:13:33,"Doc's gathering his notes, writing his report."
210,00:13:33,00:13:35,We'll be out of here first thing tomorrow.
211,00:13:35,00:13:37,Cool. Secured some tacos from down the street.
212,00:13:37,00:13:39,Weapons-grade hot sauce.
213,00:13:39,00:13:40,Thanks.
214,00:13:43,00:13:46,"So, did you read about this cartel massacre last week?"
215,00:13:46,00:13:48,"Four gunned down, one of them beheaded."
216,00:13:48,00:13:51,I've got them in the cooler right now.
217,00:13:51,00:13:53,The news treats it like it's something to celebrate.
218,00:13:53,00:13:54,But look at these guys.
219,00:13:54,00:13:56,"Murder sells papers, amigo."
220,00:13:56,00:13:57,"Yeah, but it's different down here."
221,00:13:57,00:14:00,"I mean, these cartel guys are worshipped like celebrities."
222,00:14:00,00:14:02,There's songs written about their crimes.
223,00:14:02,00:14:05,"Sure, but wasn't Vegas founded by criminals?"
224,00:14:05,00:14:07,You guys put your mobsters in a museum.
225,00:14:07,00:14:08,"That's history, not news."
226,00:14:08,00:14:11,"Okay, so who do you think buys all the drugs?"
227,00:14:11,00:14:12,Place like Sin City.
228,00:14:12,00:14:15,Come do whatever you want.
229,00:14:15,00:14:17,No cartels without customers.
230,00:14:24,00:14:25,I think you hurt his feelings.
231,00:14:25,00:14:26,"Don't get me wrong, Stokes."
232,00:14:26,00:14:29,"You hook me up with a deal at Caesars, I'm there."
233,00:14:40,00:14:42,"Something wrong, Nick?"
234,00:14:42,00:14:45,These men were all slaughtered in a cartel hit last week.
235,00:14:45,00:14:49,That paper shows cornhusks on the ground.
236,00:14:53,00:14:55,It's all over them.
237,00:14:55,00:14:58,That's the same trace that was found on Ana Ortiz.
238,00:15:01,00:15:03,Dr. Blanco?
239,00:15:03,00:15:07,I think there's been a cross-contamination of trace between the bodies.
240,00:15:07,00:15:08,Bull.
241,00:15:08,00:15:12,"This place might not be pretty, but I do my job right."
242,00:15:12,00:15:14,I don't make mistakes like that.
243,00:15:14,00:15:18,"If that's true, then Ana Ortiz was at the same place where those four men were murdered."
244,00:15:18,00:15:21,"We found traces of cornhusk on her body, the same way they had it."
245,00:15:25,00:15:27,"Dr. Blanco, there's more to her story, isn't there?"
246,00:15:30,00:15:33,I recovered those men from the site of the massacre.
247,00:15:33,00:15:34,Cartel property.
248,00:15:34,00:15:36,Used to be a cornfield.
249,00:15:36,00:15:41,"Next day, an anonymous caller said that I left a body behind."
250,00:15:41,00:15:45,"Went back out there, little bit away from where the other bodies fell."
251,00:15:45,00:15:50,There was a girl.
252,00:15:50,00:15:52,"So, you lied to us."
253,00:15:52,00:15:54,You're here for the girl.
254,00:15:54,00:15:56,Not the cartel killings.
255,00:15:56,00:15:57,And she wasn't shot like the other...
256,00:15:57,00:16:00,"men, so why-why keep digging into it?"
257,00:16:00,00:16:02,I want to see the investigative file on that shooting right now.
258,00:16:02,00:16:04,She died of an overdose.
259,00:16:04,00:16:06,An overdose of cocaine.
260,00:16:06,00:16:07,All right?
261,00:16:07,00:16:08,"So, let it be."
262,00:16:08,00:16:10,I need to see that file.
263,00:16:13,00:16:14,There isn't one.
264,00:16:14,00:16:15,"Oh, come on."
265,00:16:15,00:16:17,"He's not lying to you, Stokes."
266,00:16:17,00:16:20,"Cartel-on-cartel crime, nobody's looking into that."
267,00:16:20,00:16:21,Then we will.
268,00:16:21,00:16:24,What? We came here to determine what happened to Ana Ortiz.
269,00:16:24,00:16:26,"And by God, that's what we're gonna do."
270,00:16:26,00:16:32,"Now, her body was found at the scene of that massacre, we're gonna go back out there, and we're gonna process it."
271,00:16:32,00:16:33,"Nick, I'm not so sure..."
272,00:16:33,00:16:37,You want to go stand in a field that's still bloody from the last guys who stood there.
273,00:16:37,00:16:38,We'd be target practice.
274,00:16:38,00:16:40,"Well, if you think it's too dangerous..."
275,00:16:40,00:16:42,I'll go alone.
276,00:17:03,00:17:06,(speaking in Spanish)
277,00:17:06,00:17:08,You trust these guys?
278,00:17:08,00:17:10,Local PD was the best protection my office could coordinate.
279,00:17:10,00:17:13,These guys are safer than nothing.
280,00:17:13,00:17:15,That's debatable.
281,00:17:16,00:17:23,"So, Dr. Blanco said he found Ana's body right around here."
282,00:17:23,00:17:25,And look at this.
283,00:17:25,00:17:28,Same cocaine trace that was found in Ana's nose.
284,00:17:31,00:17:32,(speaking Spanish)
285,00:17:34,00:17:35,Tire treads.
286,00:17:35,00:17:39,Looks like they came to a stop right here.
287,00:17:39,00:17:41,SILVA: 18-wheeler.
288,00:17:45,00:17:48,"Javier, there's flakes of blood in these treads."
289,00:17:48,00:17:50,The truck drove through the blood from the massacre.
290,00:17:50,00:17:52,(gunfire)
291,00:17:52,00:17:54,That's what I'm thinking.
292,00:17:54,00:17:57,(policemen speaking Spanish)
293,00:18:01,00:18:03,Who the hell is that?
294,00:18:03,00:18:05,"¿Quien es ese, señor?"
295,00:18:12,00:18:13,Be ready.
296,00:18:17,00:18:19,(gun clicks)
297,00:18:22,00:18:25,(speaking Spanish)
298,00:18:32,00:18:38,"What was that? Said he heard we were investigating an overdosed American girl, so why the hell are we poking around the blood of the cartel?"
299,00:18:46,00:18:47,Right.
300,00:18:47,00:18:56,"You know, the way the blood is flaked in these treads tells me this blood pool was dry when the truck drove through it, and that was at least a couple hours after the massacre."
301,00:18:56,00:19:02,"It stopped right there, and it dumped Ana's body right over there."
302,00:19:02,00:19:04,Fascinating. Can we get the hell out of here?
303,00:19:06,00:19:08,"Yeah, let's go."
304,00:19:41,00:19:42,Hey. Hey.
305,00:19:42,00:19:46,Just finished processing the concrete couple's clothes.
306,00:19:46,00:19:49,That was kind of a sexy little dress she had on there.
307,00:19:49,00:20:02,"Nice shoes, too, although the, uh, soles had speckles of paint on them. Well, I have a bullet and I have a gun, but I have no way to fire it to make a comparison, because the gun barrel is split like a banana peel."
308,00:20:02,00:20:04,The expansive mortar got in it. Yeah.
309,00:20:04,00:20:06,So I've tried something different.
310,00:20:06,00:20:10,I've Microsiled the inside of the barrel. That works?
311,00:20:16,00:20:18,"Yes, it does."
312,00:20:27,00:20:28,It's a match.
313,00:20:28,00:20:30,We've got our murder weapon.
314,00:20:30,00:20:31,The killer left it in the vic's hand.
315,00:20:31,00:20:36,"Oh, I also found an errant hair in the cement. Henry ran DNA on it."
316,00:20:36,00:20:39,"Did not match either one of our victims, so..."
317,00:20:39,00:20:41,hopefully could be the killer's.
318,00:20:43,00:20:48,"I can smell the health code violations in that place from here, Doc. ROBBINS: Hodges..."
319,00:20:48,00:20:51,Promise me I can't get a staph infection through the Internet.
320,00:20:51,00:20:53,"Hodges, the tox reports, please."
321,00:20:53,00:20:58,Right. I ran a full drug screen on the sample of heart blood you sent.
322,00:20:58,00:21:01,Ana Ortiz was completely clean.
323,00:21:01,00:21:03,"ROBBINS: Well, that makes no sense."
324,00:21:03,00:21:06,Cocaine was collected from inside her nostrils.
325,00:21:06,00:21:09,"Well, then she must have exercised remarkable nasal restraint."
326,00:21:09,00:21:11,Don't know what else I can tell you.
327,00:21:11,00:21:12,"Oh, yeah... Hmm."
328,00:21:12,00:21:17,"Definitely see some mold spores up in that corner of the ceiling over there. Hodges, uh, we're starting to lose connection."
329,00:21:17,00:21:18,"Thank you, Hodges."
330,00:21:18,00:21:20,"Whoa, wait a..."
331,00:21:20,00:21:23,"(sighs) Uh, Dr. Blanco, may I use one of your microscopes?"
332,00:21:23,00:21:25,Should I check it for health code violations?
333,00:21:25,00:21:30,"That man is a hypochondriac and a lunatic, and I apologize."
334,00:21:34,00:21:36,Thank you.
335,00:21:36,00:21:37,So what are you thinking?
336,00:21:37,00:21:45,"Now, with a drug overdose eliminated, other explanation for Ana's symptoms is poisoning."
337,00:21:45,00:21:47,Look at that.
338,00:21:49,00:21:52,BLANCO: Alternating dark bands near the root.
339,00:21:52,00:21:54,Heavy metal poisoning?
340,00:21:54,00:21:55,Certainly appears that way.
341,00:21:55,00:21:57,Seen my share of that.
342,00:21:58,00:22:03,"As a young coroner, this area was full of industrial pollution."
343,00:22:03,00:22:06,Factories were no better than the cartels.
344,00:22:07,00:22:09,They left babies on my table.
345,00:22:13,00:22:14,"Oh, yeah. Mees' lines."
346,00:22:14,00:22:16,Consistent with heavy metal poisoning.
347,00:22:16,00:22:18,It could also explain the frostbite on her feet.
348,00:22:18,00:22:21,"Toxic metals can cause peripheral neuropathy, Yeah."
349,00:22:21,00:22:23,make one's feet feel like they're burning.
350,00:22:23,00:22:25,She may have been icing them.
351,00:22:25,00:22:31,"So the question is, how was she poisoned and why did she end up at that massacre site?"
352,00:22:31,00:22:35,"She was dumped there by a semi truck, hours after the shooting."
353,00:22:35,00:22:37,"Well, Nick, I'll match and raise your discovery."
354,00:22:37,00:22:40,Ana Ortiz didn't have any drugs in her system.
355,00:22:40,00:22:42,Not an overdose. Heavy metal poisoning.
356,00:22:42,00:22:44,"Wait a minute, now."
357,00:22:44,00:22:46,Then what is this stuff?
358,00:22:46,00:22:49,I was hoping you'd figure that out.
359,00:22:49,00:22:50,Okay.
360,00:22:51,00:22:53,"Is that your water, Doctor?"
361,00:23:00,00:23:02,Doesn't dissolve in water.
362,00:23:02,00:23:04,Not cocaine.
363,00:23:10,00:23:13,This is pulverized plastic.
364,00:23:13,00:23:16,"They melt it down and use it to make milk jugs, stuff like that."
365,00:23:16,00:23:19,So how did it get on Ana Ortiz?
366,00:23:19,00:23:22,"Any, uh, plastics production around here?"
367,00:23:22,00:23:23,There's a plant outside of town.
368,00:23:23,00:23:28,"ROBBINS: Well, the fact that Ana had it in her nose and her hair suggests she was around a lot of it."
369,00:23:28,00:23:32,Maybe buried in it. Semi could've come from that plant.
370,00:23:32,00:23:35,"I got to get out there, check out those trucking records."
371,00:23:35,00:23:38,That plant-- like much around here-- is infected.
372,00:23:38,00:23:41,Ties to cartel trafficking and money laundering.
373,00:23:41,00:23:43,"They're not gonna be happy to see you there, my friend."
374,00:23:43,00:23:44,I don't care.
375,00:23:44,00:23:46,What did I miss?
376,00:23:46,00:23:47,"Hey, grab your stuff."
377,00:23:47,00:23:49,We're going on another field trip.
378,00:23:49,00:23:50,¿Otra vez?
379,00:23:50,00:23:51,Yippie ki-yay.
380,00:23:55,00:24:00,SANDERS: The concrete the killer poured all over your wife and brother's bodies...
381,00:24:00,00:24:02,we crushed it all up.
382,00:24:02,00:24:04,Found this hair.
383,00:24:04,00:24:05,It's yours.
384,00:24:06,00:24:08,It's my equipment.
385,00:24:08,00:24:10,The hair must have been in the mixer from before.
386,00:24:10,00:24:15,"Do you, uh, have receipts from your trip, to show that you were in Bakersfield all night?"
387,00:24:15,00:24:17,You mean for an alibi.
388,00:24:17,00:24:19,Why the hell would I kill my own wife and brother?
389,00:24:19,00:24:22,Your wife was wearing a pretty revealing outfit when she died.
390,00:24:22,00:24:27,"So? So... your brother, alone in the house with your wife."
391,00:24:27,00:24:32,"You head out of town, come home early, catch them in the middle of something."
392,00:24:32,00:24:35,"What kind of slapstick porno are you living in, pal?"
393,00:24:35,00:24:37,"My wife, with Jeff?"
394,00:24:37,00:24:40,My wife had the house fumigated after Jeff visited for Christmas last year.
395,00:24:40,00:24:42,She looked at him like he was an ape.
396,00:24:42,00:24:45,Claire with Jeff?
397,00:24:45,00:24:49,Not in a million lifetimes.
398,00:24:49,00:24:50,I'll get you those receipts from my trip.
399,00:24:50,00:24:54,"But tell me you guys are working on some real leads, too, right?"
400,00:24:56,00:25:00,That's the plastic company's trucking records for the last two weeks.
401,00:25:00,00:25:02,How'd you get that? Slipped some cash to an office clerk.
402,00:25:02,00:25:04,"I mean, you were right, Dr. B."
403,00:25:04,00:25:06,They're into a lot more than just plastic over there.
404,00:25:06,00:25:10,"A lot of firepower. I mean, who needs an M-16 to guard milk jugs, you know what I mean?"
405,00:25:10,00:25:14,"ROBBINS: So, let's see who was trucking pulverized plastics when Ana Ortiz was dumped."
406,00:25:14,00:25:15,On the ground.
407,00:25:15,00:25:16,En el piso.
408,00:25:16,00:25:18,"Get back, get back, guys. Somos policía."
409,00:25:18,00:25:20,¿Qué pasó?
410,00:25:20,00:25:21,NICK: What's going on?
411,00:25:21,00:25:23,(officers yelling in Spanish)
412,00:25:26,00:25:28,Whoa! Oh!
413,00:25:28,00:25:30,Javier Silva. You're under arrest for the murder of Ana Ortiz.
414,00:25:30,00:25:32,¿Qué? What?
415,00:25:32,00:25:36,"That's crazy, man. Who-Who sent you guys down here, huh? Who told you to come do this?"
416,00:25:36,00:25:39,Hey!
417,00:25:39,00:25:40,Hey.
418,00:25:40,00:25:42,"It's gonna be all right, Javier."
419,00:25:53,00:25:54,"STOKES: Oh, we're all right."
420,00:25:54,00:25:57,"I mean, we're under house ar... well, morgue arrest."
421,00:25:57,00:25:58,But we're fine.
422,00:25:58,00:26:01,"BRASS: Well, I'm here with representatives of the State Department."
423,00:26:01,00:26:04,We're going to extricate you and the doc ASAP.
424,00:26:04,00:26:05,But there's a snag.
425,00:26:05,00:26:11,The Arquero police department has the two of you as persons of interest in the death Ana Ortiz. You got to be kidding me. Really?
426,00:26:11,00:26:17,"The investigation obviously stepped on the wrong snakeskin boots. Well, I'm worried about how they're taking it out on Agent Silva."
427,00:26:17,00:26:19,"There's no word from him yet, is there?"
428,00:26:19,00:26:20,Nada. That's a negative.
429,00:26:20,00:26:22,"But hang tight, Nicky."
430,00:26:22,00:26:23,We'll get you out of there. Okay.
431,00:26:23,00:26:26,(phone clicks off) Well...
432,00:26:26,00:26:29,How you guys feeling?
433,00:26:29,00:26:30,Splendid.
434,00:26:30,00:26:31,I love visitors.
435,00:26:31,00:26:36,"ROBBINS: Listen, the best way we can help Agent Silva..."
436,00:26:36,00:26:40,is to find out exactly what happened to Ana Ortiz.
437,00:26:40,00:26:42,The trucking records.
438,00:26:43,00:26:45,I'll entertain the company.
439,00:26:53,00:27:00,"You think Ana came down here, crossed paths with the cartel somehow, and they had one of their truckers dispose of her body?"
440,00:27:10,00:27:14,"Hey, Doc, I'm not so sure that trouble found her down here."
441,00:27:15,00:27:17,I think that trouble found her in Las Vegas.
442,00:27:17,00:27:20,"Take a look at this trucker, right here."
443,00:27:20,00:27:25,"Now, he's from Arquero, but he has a regular route between here and Las Vegas."
444,00:27:25,00:27:27,He was in Las Vegas eight days ago.
445,00:27:27,00:27:28,When Ana went missing.
446,00:27:28,00:27:29,That's right.
447,00:27:36,00:27:42,"Hey, Jim, it's Nick again. Listen, I think I have someone you guys should look into."
448,00:27:44,00:27:47,How we doing with Nick's trucker suspect?
449,00:27:47,00:27:50,"Well, the Vegas plastics company's been cooperative."
450,00:27:50,00:27:54,Given us some good information on Mateo Garcia's truck and his schedule.
451,00:27:54,00:27:58,He is on his way to Las Vegas right now to pick up his regular shipment.
452,00:27:58,00:28:00,Should be in Las Vegas by breakfast.
453,00:28:00,00:28:02,And Brass will pick him up.
454,00:28:02,00:28:04,"Okay, thanks."
455,00:28:04,00:28:06,"I really appreciate your concern, David, but we're fine."
456,00:28:06,00:28:12,Are you sure? I-I'll call my dad's Air Force buddies. Some of those guys are crazy enough to come get you.
457,00:28:12,00:28:14,"I'll take a rain check, okay?"
458,00:28:14,00:28:17,"Hey, I, uh... I heard about the concrete couple."
459,00:28:17,00:28:20,How did their autopsies go?
460,00:28:20,00:28:21,You're checking up on my work?
461,00:28:21,00:28:23,Of course not.
462,00:28:23,00:28:24,I'm just killing some time.
463,00:28:24,00:28:27,"Oh. Okay, well, let's take a look."
464,00:28:27,00:28:30,Nothing surprising on him.
465,00:28:30,00:28:33,C.O.D. is a gunshot wound to the temple.
466,00:28:33,00:28:35,"Big exit wound, though."
467,00:28:35,00:28:38,"But with her, things are a bit more complicated."
468,00:28:41,00:28:44,That hole in her head would be my guess.
469,00:28:44,00:28:45,"Thank you, Dr. Blanco."
470,00:28:45,00:28:47,And you are right.
471,00:28:47,00:28:49,C.O.D. is the gunshot wound.
472,00:28:49,00:28:51,But...
473,00:28:51,00:28:54,there are other factors.
474,00:28:54,00:28:56,Extensive damage to the liver and the kidneys.
475,00:28:56,00:29:03,"And, Doc, I took a look at her hair and I saw alternating dark bands."
476,00:29:06,00:29:08,"Check her fingernails, David."
477,00:29:08,00:29:09,Gotcha.
478,00:29:09,00:29:11,False nails.
479,00:29:11,00:29:13,One's missing.
480,00:29:13,00:29:15,I'll see if I can scrape off the glue.
481,00:29:15,00:29:16,Good.
482,00:29:20,00:29:21,Mees' lines.
483,00:29:21,00:29:23,Heavy metal poisoning?
484,00:29:23,00:29:25,(exhales) Go to the scope.
485,00:29:25,00:29:29,Get measurements on the dark bands in her hair.
486,00:29:29,00:29:31,Absolutely.
487,00:29:33,00:29:37,"Two bands, half a millimeter wide."
488,00:29:37,00:29:39,And a half a millimeter apart.
489,00:29:39,00:29:41,Poisoned on alternating days.
490,00:29:41,00:29:42,Same pattern as Ana Ortiz.
491,00:29:42,00:29:47,"David, two women from Vegas poisoned the same way-- that can't be coincidence."
492,00:29:47,00:29:53,"Doc, you went all the way down to Mexico and we're working on the same case."
493,00:29:53,00:29:57,"BRASS: So you got her in your truck, and you took her for a ride, isn't that right, Mateo?"
494,00:29:57,00:29:59,I have no idea what happened to her.
495,00:29:59,00:30:00,"Well, let me jog your memory, okay?"
496,00:30:00,00:30:02,"You're on a long haul, you're a lonely guy."
497,00:30:02,00:30:05,You see a beautiful girl in Vegas. You pick her up.
498,00:30:05,00:30:09,"Maybe she'll accompany you on your trip to Arquero, right?"
499,00:30:09,00:30:11,No. We know that you drove her down there.
500,00:30:11,00:30:12,But I didn't know.
501,00:30:12,00:30:15,All right? I loaded my truck at the Vegas plant.
502,00:30:15,00:30:18,20 drums of pulverized plastic. Mm-hmm.
503,00:30:18,00:30:20,Drove it down to Arquero. Okay.
504,00:30:20,00:30:21,"Straight through, no stops."
505,00:30:21,00:30:25,"When I got there, I started unloading."
506,00:30:25,00:30:28,One of the drums felt... too heavy.
507,00:30:28,00:30:30,She was inside.
508,00:30:30,00:30:31,Muerta.
509,00:30:31,00:30:33,Muerta.
510,00:30:33,00:30:35,And how did she end up like that?
511,00:30:35,00:30:36,Yo no sé.
512,00:30:36,00:30:38,But I called the Arquero police.
513,00:30:38,00:30:41,They wanted nothing to do with a dead American girl.
514,00:30:41,00:30:48,So you dumped this poor girl's body like a piece of road trip trash in a field?
515,00:30:48,00:30:53,"Señor, I could have made it so that nobody ever saw her again."
516,00:30:53,00:31:00,"But I wanted the girl, y su familia, to get a chance to get some answers."
517,00:31:00,00:31:06,"So I hear about the cartel massacre, and I took the girl to that field."
518,00:31:06,00:31:09,And then you told the coroner he missed one.
519,00:31:09,00:31:15,"Whatever happened to that poor girl, it happened up here."
520,00:31:15,00:31:21,BRODY: So Brass thinks that the truck driver was just an unwitting transporter of Ana Ortiz's body?
521,00:31:21,00:31:24,"Well, tox says both Ana and Claire were poisoned by thallium."
522,00:31:24,00:31:26,Same pattern of dosing.
523,00:31:26,00:31:29,So it has to be the same poison suspect.
524,00:31:29,00:31:34,Whoever that is must have dumped Ana Ortiz's body in the barrel at the Las Vegas plastics facility.
525,00:31:34,00:31:37,And then moved on to their next victim.
526,00:31:37,00:31:42,"All right, so hair analysis shows that Claire's poisoning began four days after Ana's body was dumped."
527,00:31:42,00:31:47,"But before the poison had the chance to kill Claire, she was gunned down along with her Jeff Marsh."
528,00:31:47,00:31:53,"Yeah, I feel like the killer panicked, like he couldn't wait for the poison to do its job."
529,00:31:53,00:31:55,Ana's disappearance was getting a lot of attention.
530,00:31:55,00:31:57,It might have put pressure on him.
531,00:31:57,00:32:00,"You know, Ana and Claire have the same killer."
532,00:32:00,00:32:02,So what else do they have in common?
533,00:32:02,00:32:06,Any overlap in their life could be where they crossed paths with their assailant.
534,00:32:06,00:32:09,"Well, Ana's 18, child of privilege."
535,00:32:09,00:32:14,"Claire is 15 years older, scraping by on temp receptionist jobs around town."
536,00:32:14,00:32:16,And they lived in different neighborhoods.
537,00:32:16,00:32:18,No apparent family connection.
538,00:32:18,00:32:20,"You guys, tip just came in from PD."
539,00:32:20,00:32:24,"A friend of Claire's heard about her murder, and thought this could be a lead."
540,00:32:24,00:32:26,Claire texted her this photo three days ago.
541,00:32:26,00:32:30,"""Ready for a visit with my artiste."" Seeing someone on the side?"
542,00:32:30,00:32:35,"Friend said Claire didn't give her any details, but, Morgan, you found trace of paint on Claire's shoes, right?"
543,00:32:35,00:32:39,It could be that Claire had contact with this artiste around the time of her death.
544,00:32:39,00:32:42,Anything that can help solve Claire's case can help solve Ana's.
545,00:32:42,00:32:44,Where was the photo taken?
546,00:32:44,00:32:46,Henry just analyzed the metadata.
547,00:32:46,00:32:48,Picture was snapped at a house in Henderson.
548,00:32:48,00:32:50,Want to check it out?
549,00:32:50,00:32:51,LVPD!
550,00:32:57,00:33:01,Elderly homeowner leases out the guesthouse to a guy.
551,00:33:01,00:33:04,"Uses it as his studio, pays cash."
552,00:33:04,00:33:06,All clear.
553,00:33:06,00:33:08,You got a name?
554,00:33:08,00:33:10,"No, she swears she wrote it down somewhere."
555,00:33:51,00:33:53,Ana Ortiz.
556,00:33:58,00:34:00,Claire Marsh.
557,00:34:00,00:34:02,Lifelike.
558,00:34:02,00:34:03,For the last time.
559,00:34:12,00:34:14,It's a shame the artist didn't sign his work.
560,00:34:14,00:34:17,Didn't leave any indication of who he is.
561,00:34:17,00:34:20,"You know, Claire was wearing that dress when she was shot."
562,00:34:20,00:34:23,"Maybe she was here shortly before, posing."
563,00:34:27,00:34:28,Whoa.
564,00:34:28,00:34:30,Got some broken glass.
565,00:34:34,00:34:37,Red wine with trace of something in it.
566,00:34:40,00:34:42,Got some personal letters here.
567,00:34:44,00:34:47,Green flame.
568,00:34:47,00:34:48,It's thallium.
569,00:34:48,00:34:50,He hid the poison in the wine.
570,00:34:52,00:34:56,"SANDERS: Tastelsess, odorless."
571,00:34:56,00:34:57,The victims had no idea.
572,00:35:00,00:35:03,"Greg, one of these is from Ana Ortiz."
573,00:35:03,00:35:06,"""My love, I can't be yours forever."
574,00:35:06,00:35:11,"""You're capturing me in your work, and that will have to be enough for now."" She was pulling away from him."
575,00:35:11,00:35:13,But he wasn't going to let that happen.
576,00:35:13,00:35:20,"He poisoned her to weaken her, make her sick, dependent on him so she couldn't leave, but he pushed it too far."
577,00:35:20,00:35:23,"When a sadist kills a plaything, he needs a replacement."
578,00:35:23,00:35:25,A new victim to control. Claire.
579,00:35:33,00:35:34,Hey.
580,00:35:34,00:35:37,Claire was missing an acrylic fingernail.
581,00:35:37,00:35:39,Here it is.
582,00:35:41,00:35:44,"You know, Ana was all over the news."
583,00:35:44,00:35:46,Claire might have recognized her.
584,00:35:46,00:35:49,SIDLE: She was holding a portrait of Ana...
585,00:35:49,00:35:50,She looks familiar.
586,00:35:50,00:35:53,Then the artist yanked it away from her.
587,00:35:53,00:35:55,SANDERS: She realized he was bad news.
588,00:35:55,00:35:58,SIDLE: He follows her home to silence her.
589,00:35:58,00:36:00,Brother-in-law had the bad luck of being there.
590,00:36:05,00:36:07,Claire was gonna be an artist before we met.
591,00:36:07,00:36:08,Still had some friends from back then.
592,00:36:08,00:36:11,One of the guys-- she used to model for him.
593,00:36:11,00:36:13,"I told her I didn't want to hear about it. Well, I want to hear about it."
594,00:36:13,00:36:15,"So, this dude's the killer, you're saying?"
595,00:36:15,00:36:16,It's just someone we want to talk to.
596,00:36:16,00:36:18,What's his name?
597,00:36:18,00:36:19,I don't remember.
598,00:36:19,00:36:21,You don't remember? No!
599,00:36:21,00:36:27,"I wasn't interested in hearing about some guy, sat there staring at my wife with his brush in his hand."
600,00:36:27,00:36:29,"If I knew his name, I'd tell you."
601,00:36:29,00:36:39,RUSSELL: We found some letters that Ana wrote that lead us to believe that the artist who painted this was in a relationship with your daughter.
602,00:36:39,00:36:41,"Why would Ana keep that from me? Well, I don't know."
603,00:36:41,00:36:44,I don't know. Maybe he was an older man.
604,00:36:44,00:36:49,Somebody who could manipulate her into keeping a secret.
605,00:36:49,00:36:50,This is the person who hurt her.
606,00:36:50,00:36:52,"Yeah, look, there's one other thing, sir."
607,00:36:52,00:36:57,My... my CSIs found a trucking manifest.
608,00:36:57,00:37:02,Ana's body was found in a barrel that belonged to a company here in Las Vegas.
609,00:37:02,00:37:04,A Partell Manufacturing.
610,00:37:04,00:37:05,What?
611,00:37:05,00:37:14,"We checked the employment records, and the other victim, Claire Marsh, worked for Partell recently for a few days as a temporary receptionist."
612,00:37:14,00:37:16,We've also discovered that...
613,00:37:16,00:37:19,you're on the board of... of that company.
614,00:37:19,00:37:22,I hope you're not implying that I had something to do with it.
615,00:37:22,00:37:24,Absolutely not.
616,00:37:24,00:37:33,"But the fact that your daughter and another woman who was employed by a company that at least you're involved with, were both victims..."
617,00:37:33,00:37:36,"You know, I was just hoping you could help us connect the dots."
618,00:37:36,00:37:37,That's all.
619,00:37:37,00:37:39,You know anyone like that?
620,00:37:39,00:37:41,"I mean, who... who would be capable of such a thing?"
621,00:37:44,00:37:45,Nobody.
622,00:37:47,00:37:49,"So, if we're done..."
623,00:37:49,00:37:50,I think I need to go rest now.
624,00:37:52,00:37:53,You can see yourself out.
625,00:37:59,00:38:00,SIDLE: Russell?
626,00:38:00,00:38:05,"I checked with Partell Manufacturing HR, any chance they have an employee who also is a known artist."
627,00:38:05,00:38:09,Turns out they just commissioned a mural in their cafeteria.
628,00:38:09,00:38:10,Artist's name is Keith Garner.
629,00:38:10,00:38:15,"He worked on it late at night, because he's also got a day job."
630,00:38:15,00:38:19,"Garner's day job is an art teacher, Ana Ortiz's high school."
631,00:38:19,00:38:22,Guess where he taught 15 years ago.
632,00:38:22,00:38:23,Claire Marsh's high school.
633,00:38:23,00:38:25,He knew both our victims as young students.
634,00:38:25,00:38:27,He also attended Ana's wake.
635,00:38:27,00:38:28,She will not be forgotten.
636,00:38:28,00:38:37,"He must have bumped into Claire again at the factory, and invited her back to his studio as a kind of-- I don't know-- replacement for Ana."
637,00:38:37,00:38:38,Brass is on his way to Garner's residence.
638,00:38:38,00:38:41,I requested a ping on his cell and a broadcast on his vehicle.
639,00:38:41,00:38:43,"Hey, look at that."
640,00:38:43,00:38:44,Ping came back on Garner's cell phone.
641,00:38:47,00:38:49,Look where he is.
642,00:38:50,00:38:52,(grunting)
643,00:38:52,00:38:54,GABRIEL: I never should have let Ana convince me to hire you!
644,00:38:54,00:38:56,(coughing) I'm so sorry.
645,00:38:56,00:38:57,"That I didn't protect you, Ana."
646,00:38:57,00:38:59,"(wheezes, coughs) That I didn't see..."
647,00:38:59,00:39:02,what this son of a bitch was doing to you!
648,00:39:03,00:39:06,No! You don't look at her!
649,00:39:06,00:39:09,She was mine.
650,00:39:09,00:39:10,I loved her.
651,00:39:10,00:39:12,I just wanted to keep her.
652,00:39:12,00:39:14,I just wanted her to need me.
653,00:39:14,00:39:16,Shut up! She loved me.
654,00:39:16,00:39:17,(grunting)
655,00:39:17,00:39:19,LVPD! Put the gun down!
656,00:39:19,00:39:21,"Gabriel. All right, all right, hey."
657,00:39:21,00:39:23,Just relax. Everybody just take a second here.
658,00:39:23,00:39:24,You don't want to do this.
659,00:39:24,00:39:25,Just put...
660,00:39:25,00:39:26,"put the weapon down, all right?"
661,00:39:26,00:39:28,He killed her. He killed my baby girl.
662,00:39:28,00:39:30,"All right, now, hey, hey, don't do that. No, no."
663,00:39:30,00:39:33,Don't you dare. Don't you dare. (gun chamber cocking)
664,00:39:33,00:39:35,"All right, everybody relax just for a second."
665,00:39:35,00:39:36,He took her from me!
666,00:39:36,00:39:37,"I know, all right, all right."
667,00:39:37,00:39:40,Just-just listen to me for one second.
668,00:39:40,00:39:43,"You can still hear Ana's voice, can't you?"
669,00:39:43,00:39:45,What is she telling you to do right now?
670,00:39:48,00:39:51,(crying)
671,00:39:51,00:39:53,(sobbing)
672,00:39:59,00:40:01,(groans)
673,00:40:01,00:40:03,(crying)
674,00:40:05,00:40:09,He took her. All right.
675,00:40:09,00:40:11,"Just give me a minute here, will you?"
676,00:40:11,00:40:13,My daughter. You did the right thing.
677,00:40:13,00:40:14,You did the right thing.
678,00:40:14,00:40:16,"Your daughter would be proud of you, Gabriel."
679,00:40:27,00:40:29,(sniffing)
680,00:40:33,00:40:34,(laughs)
681,00:40:34,00:40:37,I thought you and Stokes took the first flight out this morning.
682,00:40:37,00:40:39,"Oh, we decided to take a later one."
683,00:40:39,00:40:48,"I went to the police chief's office, and I told him how sorry we were for invading his lovely city when the real killer was a homegrown American monster."
684,00:40:48,00:40:49,(laughs)
685,00:40:49,00:40:54,"You told him that? Yeah, and I asked him to release Agent Silva from jail, and it worked."
686,00:40:54,00:40:56,Silva's a free man.
687,00:41:01,00:41:02,Gracias.
688,00:41:02,00:41:03,"Thank you for everything, Nick."
689,00:41:03,00:41:05,"You, too, Agent Silva."
690,00:41:05,00:41:09,"And, listen, if you're ever headed Vegas way, you got to look me up, all right?"
691,00:41:09,00:41:11,Will do. Okay.
692,00:41:11,00:41:14,"But keep your crazy gambles to the casinos for a while, hey?"
