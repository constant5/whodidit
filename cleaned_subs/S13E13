0,00:00:08,00:00:09,"Good evening, sir."
1,00:00:09,00:00:11,Ma'am.
2,00:00:17,00:00:21,"You know, Jonah, we don't have to be a part of this."
3,00:00:21,00:00:23,"Yes, we do."
4,00:00:23,00:00:25,I'll look like an ass if we pull out now.
5,00:00:25,00:00:28,"Besides, I really want this."
6,00:00:28,00:00:32,"Hey, so did you."
7,00:00:33,00:00:35,Remember?
8,00:00:35,00:00:37,Come on.
9,00:00:43,00:00:45,Jonah Drake. Samantha Wilson.
10,00:00:45,00:00:47,"Password, Mr. Drake."
11,00:00:47,00:00:49,Decadence.
12,00:01:00,00:01:02,(indistinct chatter and laughter)
13,00:01:05,00:01:07,Thank you.
14,00:01:32,00:01:36,You good?
15,00:01:36,00:01:37,"All set, Mr. Vogel."
16,00:01:37,00:01:39,Everything is where it needs to be.
17,00:01:39,00:01:40,"Thank you, Tom."
18,00:01:40,00:01:42,"Good evening, Mr. Vogel. Good evening."
19,00:01:42,00:01:44,"Jack, good to see you."
20,00:01:44,00:01:46,Hope our arrangement is still in order.
21,00:01:46,00:01:50,"To be honest, Jonah, I almost changed my mind this morning."
22,00:01:50,00:01:57,But then I realized I have an obligation to share my... passion.
23,00:01:57,00:01:59,I'm getting excited here.
24,00:01:59,00:02:02,"Patience is a virtue, Mr. Drake."
25,00:02:02,00:02:06,And how much is virtue going to cost me?
26,00:02:06,00:02:10,Sounds like our friend here needs a little preview.
27,00:02:32,00:02:36,"Remember, look, but don't touch."
28,00:02:47,00:02:49,You weren't lying.
29,00:02:52,00:02:54,Beautiful.
30,00:02:56,00:03:01,"Whatever the price, I'll pay it."
31,00:03:08,00:03:11,"Hey, Mitch."
32,00:03:11,00:03:13,What's with the rifle?
33,00:03:13,00:03:17,MITCH: These two knuckleheads were blasting away into the barrel over there.
34,00:03:27,00:03:30,They probably thought they hit oil.
35,00:03:30,00:03:32,"Black gold, Texas tea."
36,00:03:32,00:03:34,"Yeah, well, my nose says decomp."
37,00:03:34,00:03:36,(clears throat) I don't see any blood around here.
38,00:03:36,00:03:38,This is definitely not our primary.
39,00:03:38,00:03:41,"Well, let's not lose any of the goodness."
40,00:03:42,00:03:44,"All right, one, two, three."
41,00:03:47,00:03:49,Here goes anything.
42,00:03:53,00:03:56,(groans) (coughs)
43,00:03:57,00:03:59,That is not a pretty sight.
44,00:03:59,00:04:01,"SIDLE: Yeah, didn't start out like that, though."
45,00:04:01,00:04:03,"Black tie, tuxedo."
46,00:04:03,00:04:05,Poor guy was dressed to kill.
47,00:04:05,00:04:07,Or be killed.
48,00:04:43,00:04:46,HODGES: What's less fun than a barrel of monkeys?
49,00:04:48,00:04:50,"Hodges, his leg is jammed, okay?"
50,00:04:50,00:04:53,"A malodorous, bloated corpse in a monkey suit."
51,00:04:53,00:04:56,(groans)
52,00:04:57,00:04:59,HODGES: So disgusting.
53,00:05:01,00:05:04,"Ah, we've reached the tipping point."
54,00:05:08,00:05:09,"Oh, that is ripe."
55,00:05:12,00:05:13,(sniffing)
56,00:05:14,00:05:16,Hodges...
57,00:05:16,00:05:17,(sniffing)
58,00:05:17,00:05:19,Wh-What are you doing?
59,00:05:19,00:05:22,"As you know, I have a refined nose."
60,00:05:22,00:05:26,"And, thanks to my fiancée, a deeper appreciation for one of the finer things in life."
61,00:05:26,00:05:28,Decomp?
62,00:05:28,00:05:29,Wine.
63,00:05:29,00:05:33,And I detect a hint of frutto di Bacco.
64,00:05:33,00:05:35,"Well, I'm going to go have fun with my barrel."
65,00:05:35,00:05:37,Enjoy your corpse.
66,00:05:54,00:05:56,Can I help you with something?
67,00:05:58,00:06:00,I'm looking for D.B. Russell.
68,00:06:00,00:06:01,He wasn't in his office.
69,00:06:01,00:06:05,"I-I'm sorry, but we can't have visitors wandering the halls without an escort."
70,00:06:05,00:06:07,This is a crime lab.
71,00:06:07,00:06:09,"RUSSELL: Yeah, Hodges, relax."
72,00:06:09,00:06:13,"I think the, uh, head of the New York Crime Lab knows that a crime lab looks like."
73,00:06:13,00:06:16,Oh... I'm sorry.
74,00:06:16,00:06:17,No problem.
75,00:06:17,00:06:18,Mac Taylor.
76,00:06:18,00:06:21,"Uh, David Hodges."
77,00:06:21,00:06:22,"Um, trace."
78,00:06:22,00:06:27,"I'm sure you two have business, and, uh, yeah, so do I."
79,00:06:29,00:06:30,Ooh. Boy.
80,00:06:30,00:06:32,Hey. How was your flight?
81,00:06:32,00:06:33,It got me here.
82,00:06:33,00:06:34,Geez.
83,00:06:34,00:06:36,It's been a while. It has.
84,00:06:36,00:06:38,"Forensics convention in Kansas City, right? Ribs?"
85,00:06:38,00:06:41,That State Department boondoggle. That's right.
86,00:06:41,00:06:45,The drunken DNA expert from Chicago started singing karaoke.
87,00:06:45,00:06:46,(laughs) Freddie Mercury-- not easy to pull off.
88,00:06:46,00:06:49,He got booed off the stage.
89,00:06:49,00:06:51,The locals started throwing chicken wings... Chicken wings. Right.
90,00:06:51,00:06:54,"Right. Before I forget, let me, uh..."
91,00:06:54,00:06:55,Tickets you wanted. Thanks.
92,00:06:55,00:06:57,What do I owe you?
93,00:06:57,00:06:58,"No, it's on the house."
94,00:06:58,00:06:59,But let me ask you something.
95,00:06:59,00:07:01,Celine Dion over Jersey Boys?
96,00:07:01,00:07:03,It's a surprise for Christine.
97,00:07:03,00:07:05,"In fact, this whole trip is a surprise."
98,00:07:05,00:07:06,She already here?
99,00:07:06,00:07:07,Restaurateurs convention.
100,00:07:07,00:07:09,She started a bistro.
101,00:07:09,00:07:13,"With that and my work, it's just been hard finding time together."
102,00:07:13,00:07:14,"Oh, tell me about it."
103,00:07:14,00:07:18,"Yeah, listen, I-I didn't plan this surprise very well."
104,00:07:18,00:07:19,I haven't been able to reach Christine.
105,00:07:19,00:07:22,"She's probably still at the convention, but..."
106,00:07:22,00:07:23,"You want to check out the lab? Sure, yeah."
107,00:07:23,00:07:26,And then we can swing by her hotel and grab a bite to eat.
108,00:07:26,00:07:27,Right. Sounds like a good plan.
109,00:07:27,00:07:29,I'll give you the nickel tour here.
110,00:07:31,00:07:33,Victim's a John Doe.
111,00:07:33,00:07:39,"David didn't find any I.D., but he did find this pair of cuff links-- monogrammed."
112,00:07:39,00:07:41,J.D. John Doe.
113,00:07:41,00:07:44,Must have known where he was headed.
114,00:07:44,00:07:46,Face is badly disfigured.
115,00:07:46,00:07:50,I'm guessing that he was jammed into that barrel for at least a couple days.
116,00:07:50,00:07:55,"His position distorted his features, as did this gunshot to the face."
117,00:07:55,00:07:57,Were those shots fired by the kids?
118,00:07:57,00:08:01,"No, that would be these three postmortem wounds here on the torso."
119,00:08:01,00:08:08,"Cause of death was massive damage to the brain and brain stem, resulting from this medium-caliber bullet."
120,00:08:11,00:08:14,"This looks like a bullet wound in the hand, too."
121,00:08:14,00:08:16,ROBBINS: That's what I thought at first.
122,00:08:16,00:08:18,But let me show you something. Come on over here.
123,00:08:23,00:08:25,See how these bones are broken?
124,00:08:25,00:08:26,They're not shattered.
125,00:08:26,00:08:28,Suggests something slower than a bullet.
126,00:08:28,00:08:29,What do you think it is?
127,00:08:29,00:08:31,I can't say. There's no distinctive tool marks.
128,00:08:31,00:08:33,But there is this.
129,00:08:33,00:08:37,The object driven through the hand has some sort of head on it.
130,00:08:37,00:08:39,"You mean, like a nail?"
131,00:08:39,00:08:44,"Same idea, but a whole lot bigger."
132,00:08:44,00:08:47,Are you sure this was used to hold wine?
133,00:08:47,00:08:49,It's all charred on the inside.
134,00:08:51,00:08:53,It's supposed to be.
135,00:08:53,00:08:54,Why?
136,00:08:54,00:08:56,A toasted barrel enhances the wine.
137,00:08:56,00:08:59,Igniting intense flavors.
138,00:08:59,00:09:02,"Vanilla, mocha, toffee, tobacco."
139,00:09:02,00:09:04,Not to mention intensifying the tannins.
140,00:09:04,00:09:07,You making this stuff up? No.
141,00:09:07,00:09:10,Elisabetta's family has a winery in Tuscany.
142,00:09:10,00:09:14,"They make a robust, yet refined Brunello."
143,00:09:14,00:09:17,Which is just a fancy way of saying Sangiovese.
144,00:09:17,00:09:18,This is why I stick to vodka.
145,00:09:18,00:09:21,"No exotic terms, no dissertations."
146,00:09:21,00:09:23,You don't know what you're missing.
147,00:09:23,00:09:24,"Yeah, well, tell that to immigration."
148,00:09:24,00:09:26,That's not funny.
149,00:09:26,00:09:28,Sorry.
150,00:09:28,00:09:33,I-I really am hopeful about the whole green card thing.
151,00:09:33,00:09:35,I'm sorry. Yeah.
152,00:09:35,00:09:40,"Well, looks like our barrel is made from Quercus petraea, white oak from France."
153,00:09:40,00:09:42,Found only in the Tronçais forest.
154,00:09:42,00:09:44,Sounds fancy.
155,00:09:44,00:09:45,"So, our primary is in France?"
156,00:09:45,00:09:52,"No... what I'm saying is, barrels made from the white oak of the Tronçais forest are extremely rare."
157,00:09:52,00:09:57,Meaning it shouldn't be too hard to find the manufacturer.
158,00:09:57,00:09:58,Or who purchased it.
159,00:09:58,00:10:00,"Hey, Russell."
160,00:10:00,00:10:03,I think that we have a lead on our John Doe in the barrel.
161,00:10:03,00:10:05,What do you got? Stomach contents.
162,00:10:05,00:10:07,Guy had quite the last meal.
163,00:10:07,00:10:10,Raw whale?
164,00:10:10,00:10:12,As in whale sushi?
165,00:10:12,00:10:14,"Oh, come on, that's got to be illegal."
166,00:10:14,00:10:16,"And disgusting and immoral, but very helpful."
167,00:10:16,00:10:20,"Last month, LVPD arrested a Vince Corrado."
168,00:10:20,00:10:21,He's a sushi chef.
169,00:10:21,00:10:24,Turned out he'd been serving whale meat on the QT.
170,00:10:24,00:10:26,"And last night, he was serving at a mansion."
171,00:10:26,00:10:28,Owner's name is Albert Vogel.
172,00:10:28,00:10:29,Take these to the back.
173,00:10:29,00:10:31,"Do not drop it, okay?"
174,00:10:31,00:10:32,"You break these, you pay for it."
175,00:10:32,00:10:34,"Hey, what's in the case?"
176,00:10:34,00:10:36,Who's asking?
177,00:10:36,00:10:37,"Me, and I'm not going to ask again."
178,00:10:37,00:10:39,"Sorry. It's, uh... it's wine."
179,00:10:39,00:10:40,SIDLE: Steel crate under a guard?
180,00:10:40,00:10:42,I thought it was gold or something.
181,00:10:42,00:10:43,"Well, it might as well be."
182,00:10:43,00:10:47,It's a rare Bordeaux: 1947 Château Cheval Blanc.
183,00:10:47,00:10:50,"Well, I would sell you a bottle if you had 100 grand."
184,00:10:50,00:10:51,BRASS: What...
185,00:10:51,00:10:53,100 grand for a bottle of wine?
186,00:10:53,00:10:54,How much is the steak?
187,00:10:54,00:10:56,"It's free, if you're on the list."
188,00:10:56,00:10:57,And who are you?
189,00:10:57,00:10:59,Albert Vogel.
190,00:10:59,00:11:01,Just the man we're looking for.
191,00:11:01,00:11:03,Whale meat on the menu again tonight?
192,00:11:03,00:11:05,(laughs) That's what this is about?
193,00:11:05,00:11:07,"Actually, we're investigating a homicide."
194,00:11:07,00:11:09,(sighs)
195,00:11:09,00:11:11,That's horrible.
196,00:11:11,00:11:14,"Well, I don't... I-I don't recognize him."
197,00:11:14,00:11:17,His stomach tells us that he was here a couple of nights ago.
198,00:11:17,00:11:18,"Previous party, I presume."
199,00:11:18,00:11:22,"You mean ""auction."" I'm an auctioneer. Right."
200,00:11:22,00:11:23,Rare vintages only.
201,00:11:23,00:11:28,"The past three nights, I've sold over $20 million in wine."
202,00:11:28,00:11:29,$20 million for wine?
203,00:11:29,00:11:31,Great wine is art.
204,00:11:31,00:11:34,"Geez, I thought it was just something you drank with Italian food."
205,00:11:34,00:11:38,"SIDLE: Well, uh, your guest was wearing these cuff links."
206,00:11:38,00:11:39,Do you recognize them?
207,00:11:40,00:11:41,These belong to Jack Davari.
208,00:11:44,00:11:46,Is he a friend? More of a client.
209,00:11:46,00:11:49,He's one of the premier wine collectors in the world.
210,00:11:49,00:11:53,"Really? Well, someone shot him and collected him in a barrel."
211,00:11:53,00:11:54,Two nights ago.
212,00:11:54,00:11:56,"Well, that's horrible."
213,00:11:56,00:11:58,Jack is a good man.
214,00:11:58,00:12:00,"Well, he has a remarkable palate."
215,00:12:00,00:12:06,"Once, in a double blind tasting, he picked out the region, the vintage and the winemaker."
216,00:12:06,00:12:07,It was extraordinary.
217,00:12:07,00:12:09,Any idea who might have killed him?
218,00:12:09,00:12:13,"Well, this business can be vicious, but a... a murder?"
219,00:12:13,00:12:15,I-I... I don't think so.
220,00:12:15,00:12:19,"So, was Jack acting erratically, or, uh, anything odd about his behavior that night?"
221,00:12:19,00:12:23,"Well, he had a bit of a row with, uh, Marc Ratelle, but..."
222,00:12:23,00:12:25,Who's Marc Ratelle?
223,00:12:25,00:12:28,"Well, he's the great-great-grandson of Gustav Ratelle."
224,00:12:28,00:12:31,The scion of the Château Ratelle family.
225,00:12:31,00:12:33,It's one of the oldest winemakers in France.
226,00:12:33,00:12:35,And he was here selling his wine?
227,00:12:35,00:12:38,"Well, actually, he was trying to buy back a case from Jack."
228,00:12:38,00:12:40,That's why they were fighting.
229,00:12:40,00:12:42,Why would he want to buy back his own wine?
230,00:12:42,00:12:43,"I mean, why wouldn't he just make more?"
231,00:12:43,00:12:45,"Oh, no."
232,00:12:45,00:12:47,Not... not a 1936 Château Ratelle.
233,00:12:47,00:12:51,It is considered the best Bordeaux vintage of all time.
234,00:12:51,00:12:53,"There are only about, uh, 600 bottles left in the world."
235,00:12:53,00:12:56,And Jack was in no mood to sell?
236,00:12:56,00:12:58,"No, he wanted to put that case on auction."
237,00:12:58,00:13:00,This is a fair offer. You will take it.
238,00:13:00,00:13:03,"At auction, this will go for a hell of a lot more."
239,00:13:03,00:13:04,Jack was right.
240,00:13:04,00:13:07,"Marc offered him $200,000."
241,00:13:07,00:13:11,"When it went on auction, it made over a million."
242,00:13:11,00:13:12,Who bought it?
243,00:13:12,00:13:13,An anonymous bidder.
244,00:13:13,00:13:18,Do you know why this guy Ratelle would be so desperate to buy back his own wine?
245,00:13:18,00:13:20,"Well, the wine world is full of eccentrics."
246,00:13:20,00:13:23,"He's temperamental, he's arrogant..."
247,00:13:23,00:13:24,he's French.
248,00:13:24,00:13:27,"Well, now he's our prime suspect."
249,00:13:27,00:13:30,Made a reservation at the steakhouse at the Mediterranean.
250,00:13:30,00:13:32,I think you'll like it. Uh...
251,00:13:32,00:13:34,"Oh, Lord, she's not a vegan, is she?"
252,00:13:34,00:13:35,"Oh, no, no, she loves meat."
253,00:13:35,00:13:37,She's not responding to my texts.
254,00:13:37,00:13:39,Phone must be dead.
255,00:13:39,00:13:41,Can't get a surprise no.
256,00:13:41,00:13:43,(chuckling)
257,00:13:48,00:13:50,(knocks)
258,00:13:50,00:13:51,Christine?
259,00:13:51,00:13:54,The desk said she checked in.
260,00:13:54,00:13:56,The convention's over.
261,00:13:56,00:13:57,She should be here.
262,00:13:57,00:13:58,Mac.
263,00:14:05,00:14:08,Christine?
264,00:14:08,00:14:09,Christine?
265,00:14:12,00:14:14,Christine?
266,00:14:17,00:14:18,TAYLOR: Where is she?
267,00:14:18,00:14:21,What the hell is going on?
268,00:14:21,00:14:23,I'll call my team.
269,00:14:29,00:14:31,(line ringing)
270,00:14:36,00:14:37,Damn it!
271,00:14:37,00:14:39,Still not answering.
272,00:14:39,00:14:41,Let's just wait and see what my guys come up with.
273,00:14:45,00:14:48,"Well, I know what broke the table."
274,00:14:48,00:14:49,(grunts softly)
275,00:14:49,00:14:51,It's got blood on it.
276,00:14:52,00:14:54,Looks like transfer from a hand.
277,00:14:54,00:14:59,"There's no tissue or any other blood around, so it wasn't used as a weapon."
278,00:14:59,00:15:02,I think someone came through the door with their hands already bloody.
279,00:15:02,00:15:04,Would account for the smear on the knob.
280,00:15:04,00:15:12,"At some point, they grabbed this thing, maybe out of anger or to intimidate, and they threw it through the table."
281,00:15:13,00:15:15,(camera shutter clicks)
282,00:15:17,00:15:19,I've got something.
283,00:15:24,00:15:25,Check it out.
284,00:15:25,00:15:27,Looks like a man's dress shirt.
285,00:15:27,00:15:30,I don't see any stab marks or bullet holes.
286,00:15:30,00:15:33,All this blood was on the outside.
287,00:15:33,00:15:35,Didn't soak through to the back.
288,00:15:35,00:15:37,Or transfer.
289,00:15:37,00:15:40,Whoever was wearing this shirt wasn't the one who was bleeding.
290,00:15:40,00:15:42,Huh. Could be our suspect.
291,00:15:42,00:15:43,So who's the victim?
292,00:15:43,00:15:46,Where is the victim?
293,00:15:49,00:15:51,SANDERS: Marc Ratelle. 47 years old.
294,00:15:51,00:15:53,Owner of Château Ratelle.
295,00:15:53,00:15:54,Paris address.
296,00:15:54,00:15:58,Came to Vegas three days ago to attend the Vogel wine auction.
297,00:15:58,00:16:01,He has no criminal history.
298,00:16:01,00:16:03,"Well, Vegas is always a good place to start."
299,00:16:03,00:16:06,Brass has a BOLO out for his rental car.
300,00:16:06,00:16:08,Ratelle checked into a suite at the Tangiers on Sunday.
301,00:16:08,00:16:10,He booked it for a week.
302,00:16:10,00:16:14,"According to the guy at the front desk, he had a change of plans and he checked out this morning."
303,00:16:14,00:16:16,"Gee, I wonder why. (electronic chiming)"
304,00:16:16,00:16:18,What do you got?
305,00:16:18,00:16:19,Brass.
306,00:16:19,00:16:21,Somebody just broke into Vogel's wine cellar.
307,00:16:21,00:16:23,MAN: Mr. Ratelle!
308,00:16:23,00:16:25,Please!
309,00:16:25,00:16:26,"Calm down! Oh, what?"
310,00:16:26,00:16:28,I watch American television.
311,00:16:28,00:16:29,You will shoot me?
312,00:16:29,00:16:31,"I won't shoot you, but I will light you up."
313,00:16:31,00:16:33,(laughing): You would not dare.
314,00:16:33,00:16:36,I am standing in a pool of water! Water?
315,00:16:36,00:16:38,You mean wine.
316,00:16:38,00:16:40,I mean...
317,00:16:40,00:16:42,what I mean.
318,00:16:43,00:16:45,"Mr. Ratelle, calm down."
319,00:16:45,00:16:48,"Let's not make this into an international incident, all right?"
320,00:16:49,00:16:51,Marc! Marc.
321,00:16:51,00:16:53,What's going on?
322,00:16:53,00:16:56,"First you want to buy back your wine, now you want to destroy it all?"
323,00:16:58,00:17:00,"Okay, Officer Mitchell, light him up."
324,00:17:00,00:17:01,Don't bother.
325,00:17:01,00:17:04,I surrender.
326,00:17:04,00:17:05,Huh?
327,00:17:05,00:17:08,J'ai fini.
328,00:17:08,00:17:09,Hey. Got your text.
329,00:17:09,00:17:10,What do you got?
330,00:17:10,00:17:15,"I analyzed the blood from the shirt, as well as what was collected from the door frame and paperweight."
331,00:17:15,00:17:18,All three samples are consistent with a single donor.
332,00:17:18,00:17:19,Unknown female.
333,00:17:19,00:17:21,Uh... okay.
334,00:17:21,00:17:23,We're gonna need an exemplar of Christine Whitney's DNA.
335,00:17:23,00:17:27,"I'll call New York, have someone go by her place."
336,00:17:29,00:17:31,(sniffs)
337,00:17:34,00:17:35,(exhales)
338,00:17:37,00:17:40,That the wine from Marc Ratelle's grab and smash?
339,00:17:40,00:17:43,"Yeah, I'm gonna send the broken bits over to Henry to run for blood."
340,00:17:43,00:17:46,"Well, I hope they tell us something, because Marc isn't."
341,00:17:46,00:17:48,He's demanding to speak to the French consul general.
342,00:17:48,00:17:51,But guess what I found in the back of Ratelle's car.
343,00:18:00,00:18:03,A bottle of 1936 Château Ratelle.
344,00:18:03,00:18:10,"And, according to customs, this little bottle here is worth-- wait for it-- $82,000."
345,00:18:10,00:18:12,Totally insane.
346,00:18:12,00:18:14,"Well, I'm about to make you even more insane."
347,00:18:14,00:18:16,Something is rotten in the state of Bordeaux.
348,00:18:16,00:18:25,"You may be holding a genuine '36 Château Ratelle, but all the wine that was found at the grab and smash-- I don't think it's the genuine article."
349,00:18:25,00:18:28,It doesn't smell right.
350,00:18:28,00:18:31,"I know these labels match, but..."
351,00:18:31,00:18:32,the whole thing seems off.
352,00:18:32,00:18:34,"So, it's fake?"
353,00:18:34,00:18:40,According to your impeccable sense of taste and your oenological olfactory acuity?
354,00:18:40,00:18:41,I like that.
355,00:18:41,00:18:42,But you're right.
356,00:18:42,00:18:45,We need more than my palate and nose.
357,00:18:45,00:18:47,We need science.
358,00:18:47,00:18:49,You're not gonna...
359,00:18:49,00:18:50,Hodges!
360,00:18:52,00:18:55,"That's $82,000 worth of..."
361,00:18:55,00:18:57,(sniffs)
362,00:18:57,00:18:59,Evidence.
363,00:18:59,00:19:01,(Brody laughing)
364,00:19:01,00:19:04,"Oh, my God."
365,00:19:04,00:19:07,This is so good.
366,00:19:07,00:19:08,I have to give it to you. Mm-hmm.
367,00:19:08,00:19:11,And this is so against the rules.
368,00:19:11,00:19:13,I love it. (chuckles)
369,00:19:13,00:19:17,"Well, as the Italians say, the only way to live a little is to cheat a little."
370,00:19:17,00:19:19,Hmm?
371,00:19:19,00:19:20,(sniffs)
372,00:19:20,00:19:24,"Tobacco, cedar, mocha, leather..."
373,00:19:24,00:19:27,"hints of cassis, cherries..."
374,00:19:27,00:19:29,You are really serious.
375,00:19:29,00:19:31,So is this. This is the real deal.
376,00:19:31,00:19:32,(printer hums)
377,00:19:32,00:19:34,Huh. What does the GCMS say?
378,00:19:36,00:19:38,Wow.
379,00:19:38,00:19:42,The wine from the smashed bottles contains presence of radioactive isotopes.
380,00:19:42,00:19:43,So?
381,00:19:43,00:19:46,So it suggests a vintage that's more recent than 1936.
382,00:19:46,00:19:48,One born of the nuclear age.
383,00:19:50,00:20:00,"HODGES: After World War II, with the advent of nuclear testing, fallout changed the chemistry of the soil all around the globe."
384,00:20:00,00:20:06,"Specifically, with the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12, which makes its way into wine through grapes."
385,00:20:06,00:20:11,I guess now we know why Ratelle was smashing bottles in the wine cellar.
386,00:20:11,00:20:13,They were counterfeit. Mm-hmm.
387,00:20:13,00:20:18,Could be the same story for the case of '36 Ratelle that was for auction.
388,00:20:18,00:20:22,"If he knew that it was fake, why would he do that?"
389,00:20:22,00:20:26,"Monsieur Ratelle, the consul general is on his way."
390,00:20:26,00:20:29,"But while we wait in the meantime, I hope you'll indulge me."
391,00:20:29,00:20:33,"I... I'm a curious guy, and something about this just isn't adding up."
392,00:20:33,00:20:39,"So, Jack Davari is making counterfeit 1936 Château Ratelle."
393,00:20:39,00:20:40,"You find out about it, you get angry."
394,00:20:40,00:20:42,"I mean, you're a... you're a fiery kind of guy."
395,00:20:42,00:20:46,"You go to see him, things get out of hand..."
396,00:20:46,00:20:47,you killed him.
397,00:20:47,00:20:49,"I mean, I get that part, I do."
398,00:20:49,00:20:56,"But what I don't get is why you first offered to pay him $200,000 for a case of what you knew was just grape juice."
399,00:20:56,00:20:59,I was defending my family honor.
400,00:21:00,00:21:01,You would not understand.
401,00:21:01,00:21:03,Why don't you give me a try?
402,00:21:03,00:21:05,I am...
403,00:21:05,00:21:11,the descendant of a family that has been producing fine wine in Bordeaux since the age of Napoleon.
404,00:21:11,00:21:15,"We have witnessed war, drought, pestilence, California Merlot..."
405,00:21:15,00:21:17,(chuckles)
406,00:21:17,00:21:18,...and we have survived them all.
407,00:21:18,00:21:21,And you couldn't survive one schmuck who was watering down your brand?
408,00:21:21,00:21:23,Brand?
409,00:21:23,00:21:28,(laughing): We... we are not talking about a six-pack of beer.
410,00:21:28,00:21:34,Le trente-six Ratelle is the finest vintage produced in Bordeaux in the last century.
411,00:21:34,00:21:36,"Only 1,200 bottles were ever produced."
412,00:21:36,00:21:40,Only 609 bottles are left in the entire world.
413,00:21:40,00:21:42,I-I actually think it's 608. I saw the lab report...
414,00:21:42,00:21:45,This is how I knew that Monsieur Jack Davari was passing off counterfeit bottles.
415,00:21:45,00:21:47,So why didn't you call the police?
416,00:21:47,00:21:49,And ruin the reputation of the vintage forever?
417,00:21:49,00:21:55,The only thing more delicate than a wine...
418,00:21:55,00:21:57,is its reputation.
419,00:21:57,00:22:00,So that's why you offered to pay Davari the money.
420,00:22:00,00:22:03,"Keep things hush-hush, and keep the phony wine off the market."
421,00:22:03,00:22:06,To preserve the integrity of the Ratelle name.
422,00:22:06,00:22:12,"Which is why I may be ""fiery,"" as you say, but I am no murderer."
423,00:22:12,00:22:14,No.
424,00:22:51,00:22:54,(beeping)
425,00:23:12,00:23:13,Finn. Yeah?
426,00:23:13,00:23:15,Look what I got.
427,00:23:15,00:23:17,(groans) Diamonds and men.
428,00:23:17,00:23:19,(chuckles) Not a good combination for me.
429,00:23:19,00:23:21,Maybe you haven't found the right man.
430,00:23:21,00:23:26,I found it mixed in with the broken glass from the hotel room.
431,00:23:28,00:23:30,Laser-inscribed serial number.
432,00:23:30,00:23:33,Should get us to the owner.
433,00:23:37,00:23:38,It's closed.
434,00:23:40,00:23:42,I don't think so.
435,00:23:51,00:23:52,Safe's wide open.
436,00:23:54,00:23:56,We got a body.
437,00:23:59,00:24:01,Got a pool of blood.
438,00:24:01,00:24:03,Blood leading out the back door.
439,00:24:06,00:24:08,That looks like two to the chest.
440,00:24:10,00:24:12,Got something.
441,00:24:17,00:24:19,Christine's phone.
442,00:24:19,00:24:21,She was here.
443,00:24:26,00:24:28,STOKES: The jewelry store owner's name was Ronald Sadat.
444,00:24:28,00:24:29,"52, no family."
445,00:24:29,00:24:32,But he did leave behind one interested party.
446,00:24:32,00:24:38,"LVPD investigated Sadat for money laundering three years ago, but the case was dropped for lack of evidence."
447,00:24:38,00:24:47,"Now, the crime scene suggests a-a robbery gone bad. He-he pulls a gun out from behind the counter, fires two shots-- one hit, one miss."
448,00:24:47,00:24:49,And you found Christine's cell phone by the second blood pool.
449,00:24:49,00:24:53,And the blood did match the blood we found in the hotel room. Christine's room.
450,00:24:53,00:24:57,"We still don't have an exemplar from New York, so we-we don't know that it's her yet."
451,00:24:57,00:25:00,(sighs) What else do you have?
452,00:25:00,00:25:03,"Okay, we found a print on the jeweler's safe."
453,00:25:03,00:25:06,A hit came back to a James Boyd.
454,00:25:06,00:25:08,Queens address. Jimmy Boyd?
455,00:25:08,00:25:10,Why? Do you know him?
456,00:25:10,00:25:13,Boyd manages Christine's restaurant.
457,00:25:13,00:25:16,So Boyd came with Christine for the restaurant convention?
458,00:25:16,00:25:19,"No, no. The last I heard, she was gonna fire him-- guy's trouble."
459,00:25:19,00:25:21,What kind of trouble? Gambling debts.
460,00:25:21,00:25:23,Hangs out with the wrong crowd.
461,00:25:23,00:25:25,Christine wants nothing to do with this guy.
462,00:25:25,00:25:27,"Are you sure about that, Mac?"
463,00:25:27,00:25:29,What's that supposed to mean?
464,00:25:29,00:25:31,"Well, like I said, we found her cell phone."
465,00:25:31,00:25:36,"There were quite a few messages between her, Boyd and that jewelry shop owner, Sadat."
466,00:25:36,00:25:41,"FINLAY: About Christine wanting to open up a new restaurant in Las Vegas, and Sadat was going to invest."
467,00:25:41,00:25:47,She never said anything about wanting to open a restaurant out here-- she's got her hands full with the one she has now.
468,00:25:47,00:25:53,"FINLAY: According to the messages, Christine was the one who set up the meeting at the jewelry store, and, uh, the messages were..."
469,00:25:53,00:25:54,pretty flirtatious.
470,00:25:54,00:25:57,Then it's not her.
471,00:25:57,00:26:01,"'Cause that wouldn't happen. All right, all right, let's-let's just go back to Boyd."
472,00:26:01,00:26:05,"We know that he was in the jewelry store, but where are we thinking that he went from there?"
473,00:26:05,00:26:09,"And is he with Christine? STOKES: Well, the blood trail led out the back door to Sadat's parking spot."
474,00:26:09,00:26:14,Car wasn't there. We checked his pants-- no keys-- so we sent a BOLO out right away.
475,00:26:14,00:26:16,Don't worry. We'll find it.
476,00:26:16,00:26:18,Okay.
477,00:26:18,00:26:23,SANDERS: Looks like our angry Frenchman has an alibi for the murder of Jack Davari.
478,00:26:23,00:26:24,Busy smashing wine somewhere else?
479,00:26:24,00:26:27,"No, hitting the minibar in his own hotel room."
480,00:26:27,00:26:30,"Wait, I thought Ratelle checked out early. Not early enough."
481,00:26:30,00:26:32,Doc has Davari's time of death at 2:00 a.m.
482,00:26:32,00:26:40,"Hotel keycard records show Ratelle in his room at 1:44 a.m., and he called the front desk at 2:15 to ask for a wake-up call."
483,00:26:40,00:26:42,"Okay, uh, I guess we need a new suspect."
484,00:26:42,00:26:44,"Well, I may have already found one."
485,00:26:44,00:26:46,I got a subpoena for the auction records.
486,00:26:46,00:26:50,The anonymous bidder who paid a million for the counterfeit case of Ratelle...
487,00:26:50,00:26:52,he's got a name.
488,00:26:52,00:26:55,"BRASS: Jonah Drake, plastic surgeon and wine collector."
489,00:26:55,00:26:57,Hope you don't nip and tuck under the influence.
490,00:26:57,00:27:00,"And I hope this is important, Detective."
491,00:27:00,00:27:04,Because my fiancée and I were in the middle of a romantic lunch.
492,00:27:04,00:27:09,We didn't appreciate being dragged away by a cop right as I was popping the question.
493,00:27:09,00:27:12,You two can rekindle your romance after I pop a couple of questions of my own.
494,00:27:12,00:27:14,About Jack Davari.
495,00:27:14,00:27:15,"You knew him, right?"
496,00:27:15,00:27:19,"Casually, yeah. Really? You just ""casually"" pay a million bucks for a case of wine?"
497,00:27:19,00:27:21,"Two hours after that, you call him up."
498,00:27:21,00:27:24,"An hour later, he's dead."
499,00:27:24,00:27:25,I think you're making a mistake here.
500,00:27:25,00:27:29,I think the only mistake that was made was your million-dollar wine purchase.
501,00:27:29,00:27:34,"Look, it may seem crazy, Detective, but honestly, a million for a case of '36 Ratelle?"
502,00:27:34,00:27:36,It's kind of a steal.
503,00:27:36,00:27:38,I bet Jack was thinking the same thing.
504,00:27:38,00:27:39,Which is why you killed him.
505,00:27:39,00:27:41,What are you talking about?
506,00:27:41,00:27:43,We both know that the Ratelle is a fake.
507,00:27:43,00:27:44,"No, that's impossible."
508,00:27:44,00:27:47,Samantha and I just drank a bottle of it for lunch.
509,00:27:47,00:27:49,"Trust me, it was very real. Yeah."
510,00:27:49,00:27:51,Chemical analysis doesn't lie.
511,00:27:51,00:27:57,"Jack Davari ripped you off-- that's why you called him up, that's why you killed him, that's why you stuffed his body in a barrel."
512,00:27:57,00:27:58,I called to buy more wine.
513,00:27:58,00:28:02,"You wanted more? Why, in fact, Samantha and I had an argument over that."
514,00:28:02,00:28:04,What? O-Over buying more wine?
515,00:28:04,00:28:06,"Well, I... thought it was frivolous."
516,00:28:06,00:28:09,"Spending all that money on wine, it made me anxious."
517,00:28:09,00:28:11,"(chuckles, stammers) I'm sorry."
518,00:28:11,00:28:13,I'm from Boston. We don't like flaunting our wealth.
519,00:28:13,00:28:14,Don't worry.
520,00:28:14,00:28:16,I'll fix that.
521,00:28:16,00:28:18,"Look, so..."
522,00:28:18,00:28:19,"can we go? Yeah, you can go."
523,00:28:19,00:28:21,But leave your pager on.
524,00:28:21,00:28:24,We may need to talk to you again.
525,00:28:24,00:28:28,SIDLE: Hodges called every barrel maker in France.
526,00:28:28,00:28:33,He found somebody who shipped four Tronçais forest casks to Jack Davari at this address.
527,00:28:33,00:28:36,SANDERS: Whoa.
528,00:28:36,00:28:39,This is one serious winemaking operation.
529,00:28:46,00:28:49,More like one serious counterfeiting operation.
530,00:28:49,00:28:51,Davari was making his own labels.
531,00:28:54,00:28:58,Looks like he was using spices to enhance the flavor.
532,00:28:58,00:29:01,Make it taste more like the wine he was trying to mimic.
533,00:29:01,00:29:04,"Well, with his world-class palate, I bet he was pretty good at it."
534,00:29:08,00:29:10,"Doing his own bottling, too."
535,00:29:10,00:29:12,Got a corking machine.
536,00:29:14,00:29:17,Think I found how Jack Davari got that hole in his hand.
537,00:29:17,00:29:20,"(grunting, screams)"
538,00:29:20,00:29:23,Somebody wiped that down. Mm-hmm.
539,00:29:28,00:29:29,Missed a spot.
540,00:29:29,00:29:32,I'll take a picture and send it to Mandy.
541,00:29:34,00:29:37,"SIDLE: Missed a spot here, too."
542,00:29:37,00:29:41,"Looks like blood, high-velocity spatter from a gunshot."
543,00:29:41,00:29:44,Somebody tried to clean up.
544,00:29:47,00:29:48,Got some more blood here.
545,00:29:48,00:29:50,Gravitational drop.
546,00:29:50,00:29:53,Maybe from the wound on Davari's hand. Or...
547,00:29:53,00:29:55,"if there was a struggle, it could've come from the killer."
548,00:30:00,00:30:02,(phone chimes)
549,00:30:04,00:30:05,Mandy's on the job.
550,00:30:08,00:30:10,I know him. Tom Scola.
551,00:30:10,00:30:13,"He wanted to sell me a bottle of wine for $100,000."
552,00:30:13,00:30:15,Let's see what else he tries to sell you.
553,00:30:15,00:30:20,"SIDLE: So, Tommy, here I thought you just worked for Albert Vogel, the auctioneer, but..."
554,00:30:20,00:30:24,guess what we found when we were processing Jack Davari's counterfeit operation.
555,00:30:24,00:30:26,"I don't know, but I'm sure you're gonna tell me."
556,00:30:26,00:30:28,Your fingerprints. They were everywhere.
557,00:30:28,00:30:40,"They were on the bottles, they were on the barrels, they were on the phony labels, they were on the corking machine that punched a hole in Jack Davari's hand right before a bullet punched a hole in his face, so..."
558,00:30:40,00:30:41,what happened?
559,00:30:41,00:30:43,Did you guys have a falling out?
560,00:30:43,00:30:44,I would never kill Jack.
561,00:30:44,00:30:46,"We were friends, okay?"
562,00:30:46,00:30:47,I find that kind of hard to believe.
563,00:30:47,00:30:51,"Jack ran around in $5,000 tuxedos, and you're a glorified errand boy."
564,00:30:51,00:30:53,"I mean, I buy that he was your boss."
565,00:30:53,00:30:55,Hey. We grew up together.
566,00:30:55,00:30:58,We used to run numbers for his dad.
567,00:30:58,00:31:00,"Then his dad went to prison, and..."
568,00:31:00,00:31:05,"his mom died, so Jack and I needed to figure out a new way to make some money."
569,00:31:05,00:31:08,"Are you saying that Jack Davari, the man, is as counterfeit as his wine?"
570,00:31:08,00:31:10,I'm saying that we had a good thing going.
571,00:31:10,00:31:11,How long you been doing this?
572,00:31:11,00:31:13,About three years.
573,00:31:13,00:31:19,"We used to wait tables, and we'd watch these rich guys, you know, buying $5,000 bottles like it was nothing."
574,00:31:19,00:31:22,So we started stealing the empties.
575,00:31:22,00:31:24,"We'd copy the bottle, the label, the cork."
576,00:31:24,00:31:29,"Then Jack would find some cheap wine that tasted similar, add some flavor."
577,00:31:29,00:31:30,"The more we did it, the better we got."
578,00:31:30,00:31:32,"Okay, so you work your way up the food chain."
579,00:31:32,00:31:34,You start counterfeiting rare vintages.
580,00:31:34,00:31:35,You get Vogel involved.
581,00:31:35,00:31:37,"Or, wait a minute, was Vogel in on it?"
582,00:31:37,00:31:38,No.
583,00:31:38,00:31:41,He had no clue-- he thought Jack was some rich guy from L.A.
584,00:31:41,00:31:42,We were just getting started.
585,00:31:42,00:31:46,"We had this surgeon, Jonah Drake-- we had him on the hook, man."
586,00:31:46,00:31:49,"You know, right after the auction, he called Jack, and he wanted even more Ratelle."
587,00:31:49,00:31:52,"Okay, so again, what happened?"
588,00:31:52,00:31:54,Did Jack decide to cut you out of the grift?
589,00:31:54,00:31:56,Or did you just get jealous?
590,00:31:56,00:32:06,"I mean, come on, let's be honest, Jack's job was fun-- he went to fancy parties, he drank amazing wine, he chased beautiful women... I hate to burst your bubble, but I was nowhere near the warehouse the night that Jack was killed."
591,00:32:06,00:32:10,"Where were you? After the auction, I cooled off at the Acid Strip."
592,00:32:10,00:32:12,I was there all night.
593,00:32:12,00:32:15,"I know the owner, so you can ask him. Oh, I will."
594,00:32:15,00:32:17,I'm also gonna need a sample of your DNA.
595,00:32:17,00:32:19,(chuckles)
596,00:32:27,00:32:29,Hey.
597,00:32:29,00:32:32,"Any word on Jimmy Boyd? No, not yet."
598,00:32:32,00:32:34,Cops are still looking for Sadat's car.
599,00:32:34,00:32:37,Been reading through all these texts.
600,00:32:37,00:32:41,I can't wrap my head around the idea that Christine was keeping secrets from me.
601,00:32:41,00:32:45,"Well, maybe she just wanted the restaurant to be a surprise."
602,00:32:45,00:32:47,"No, no."
603,00:32:47,00:32:49,There's something we're missing.
604,00:32:49,00:32:52,Her hooking up with Boyd and this jewelry store guy...
605,00:32:52,00:32:54,none of it makes sense.
606,00:32:56,00:32:59,"Let me ask you something, Mac."
607,00:32:59,00:33:02,How well do you know Christine?
608,00:33:02,00:33:06,I know her... well.
609,00:33:06,00:33:09,"More importantly, I know what kind of woman she is."
610,00:33:12,00:33:13,(sighs)
611,00:33:13,00:33:15,"When I got shot, she was..."
612,00:33:15,00:33:20,she was at the hospital every single day for six months.
613,00:33:20,00:33:25,"Russ, I woke up and she was sitting by my bedside, praying for me."
614,00:33:28,00:33:32,That is not the kind of woman who...
615,00:33:33,00:33:36,Okay. (phone chimes)
616,00:33:39,00:33:41,They found Sadat's car.
617,00:33:56,00:33:58,Pop the trunk.
618,00:34:12,00:34:14,It's not her.
619,00:34:29,00:34:31,Ran the victim's prints.
620,00:34:31,00:34:33,Name's Kim Hasset.
621,00:34:33,00:34:35,Two drug priors.
622,00:34:35,00:34:37,Last known address-- Queens.
623,00:34:37,00:34:38,Like Boyd.
624,00:34:38,00:34:40,Girlfriend maybe.
625,00:34:40,00:34:43,Suffered a single gunshot to the abdomen.
626,00:34:43,00:34:46,"Judging by the amount of blood, she didn't die quick."
627,00:34:46,00:34:48,Time of death? 24 hours roughly.
628,00:34:48,00:34:50,Fits the timeline of the jewelry store robbery.
629,00:34:50,00:34:52,She could be our unknown female.
630,00:34:52,00:34:53,"Yeah, possibly."
631,00:34:53,00:34:57,"Still doesn't answer the question, where is Christine?"
632,00:34:57,00:35:04,"We know Boyd hit the jewelry store, probably with this woman, stole this car, and dumped it here."
633,00:35:04,00:35:05,That makes sense.
634,00:35:05,00:35:06,Palermo's across the street.
635,00:35:06,00:35:11,"Boyd goes back to the hotel, cleans up, picks up some of his personal effects."
636,00:35:11,00:35:13,Maybe more than that.
637,00:35:13,00:35:17,"If he was holding Christine captive in the room, maybe he went to get her."
638,00:35:17,00:35:18,"So, what's his next move?"
639,00:35:18,00:35:21,"He can't take this car, not looking the way it does."
640,00:35:21,00:35:24,Check it out.
641,00:35:24,00:35:26,Gold paint.
642,00:35:26,00:35:27,Look at that.
643,00:35:27,00:35:28,"What, is that transfer?"
644,00:35:28,00:35:31,Somebody pulled out of here in a hurry.
645,00:35:33,00:35:34,Boyd switched cars.
646,00:35:34,00:35:39,"RUSSELL: Let's get this paint back to the lab, see if we can find the vehicle it came from."
647,00:35:42,00:35:45,"Hey, I ran the blood you and Sara found at the wine warehouse."
648,00:35:45,00:35:50,Two contributors-- our victim Jack Davari and our suspect Tom Scola.
649,00:35:50,00:35:51,What?
650,00:35:51,00:35:52,What? I thought you'd be happy.
651,00:35:52,00:35:53,You got your man.
652,00:35:53,00:35:56,"Well, not according to the Acid Strip."
653,00:35:56,00:35:59,Scola said that he went to the strip club after the auction.
654,00:35:59,00:36:04,"The owner, the bouncer, the bartender and surveillance all confirm that he was there at the time of the murder."
655,00:36:04,00:36:06,"There's no way, no."
656,00:36:06,00:36:09,Not only was it Scola's blood at the scene; it was commingled with the victim's.
657,00:36:09,00:36:11,He had to have killed him.
658,00:36:11,00:36:15,There's no other explanation. It says here that you found heightened levels of estrogen in his blood?
659,00:36:15,00:36:19,"Yeah, I figured maybe Scola was undergoing treatment for prostate cancer."
660,00:36:19,00:36:22,It would explain why a man has increased estrogen levels.
661,00:36:22,00:36:24,Or he might not be the one with the cancer.
662,00:36:26,00:36:29,I'm gonna need to get a warrant for Scola's medical records.
663,00:36:30,00:36:35,"Tom Scola may have done a lot of bad in his life, but he did at least one good thing."
664,00:36:35,00:36:36,He was a bone marrow donor.
665,00:36:36,00:36:46,"SANDERS: When a patient receives a bone marrow transplant, the sick bone marrow cells are destroyed and replaced by the healthy bone marrow cells of the donor."
666,00:36:46,00:36:55,"And since bone marrow produces blood cells in the body, the transplant recipient begins producing blood cells with DNA identical to the donor."
667,00:36:55,00:37:03,"The problem is, it's hard to find a match, but the odds are better when the transplant is from sibling to sibling."
668,00:37:03,00:37:07,"Say, from a brother to a sister."
669,00:37:10,00:37:19,"Your brother told us about Jack Davari not being who he said he was, but he left out the part about his sister."
670,00:37:19,00:37:28,"SIDLE: Who went from being Samantha Scola from Northtown to the very uptown Samantha Wilson from Boston, right, where you were taught not to flaunt your wealth."
671,00:37:28,00:37:30,Everyone's entitled to a second chance.
672,00:37:30,00:37:31,I agree.
673,00:37:31,00:37:33,So how come you didn't give one to Jack Davari?
674,00:37:33,00:37:41,"We searched your Range Rover, found blood in the back and trace from the wine barrel."
675,00:37:41,00:37:47,"Samantha, this is your one chance to help yourself and your brother."
676,00:37:47,00:37:49,Think you owe it to him.
677,00:37:49,00:37:52,Because we will definitely go after him as a coconspirator.
678,00:37:52,00:37:54,"No, no, Tommy had nothing to do with this."
679,00:37:54,00:37:56,I didn't want to kill Jack; I just wanted out.
680,00:37:56,00:37:58,Out of what?
681,00:37:59,00:38:01,The grift.
682,00:38:01,00:38:03,We all had our jobs.
683,00:38:03,00:38:06,Tommy had the connection to Vogel.
684,00:38:06,00:38:08,"Jack had the polish, the palate."
685,00:38:09,00:38:12,"I worked the guys, softened 'em up."
686,00:38:12,00:38:14,"So, what changed?"
687,00:38:14,00:38:16,Jonah Drake.
688,00:38:17,00:38:20,I fell in love with him.
689,00:38:20,00:38:22,I wanted Jack to find another mark.
690,00:38:25,00:38:28,Jonah was just so hot for that Château Ratelle.
691,00:38:28,00:38:30,He was going to go back in and buy more of it.
692,00:38:30,00:38:36,"Was going to walk into the same scam again, so I went to Jack, asked him to leave Jonah alone."
693,00:38:36,00:38:38,This guy's a gold mine.
694,00:38:38,00:38:40,"Give me a break, Sam, go find yourself another boyfriend."
695,00:38:40,00:38:45,"I'll tell him you're a fraud. No, you won't because then I'll have to tell him how you pay the rent."
696,00:38:45,00:38:48,Not anymore-- I'm out.
697,00:38:48,00:38:49,(laughs)
698,00:38:49,00:38:52,"Once a whore, always a whore."
699,00:38:55,00:38:56,(grunts)
700,00:38:56,00:38:57,"(Jack murmurs, Samantha exclaims)"
701,00:38:57,00:38:59,You work for me.
702,00:38:59,00:39:02,I own you.
703,00:39:05,00:39:06,(Jack screams)
704,00:39:06,00:39:08,Bitch!
705,00:39:08,00:39:11,(gunshot)
706,00:39:11,00:39:14,I just wanted to be with Jonah.
707,00:39:14,00:39:19,"He was going to give me the life I'd dreamed of, help me become the person I really am."
708,00:39:19,00:39:22,I couldn't let Jack take that away from me.
709,00:39:23,00:39:25,"You understand, don't you?"
710,00:39:25,00:39:27,"I don't, no."
711,00:39:27,00:39:29,Poor guy.
712,00:39:29,00:39:33,He only loved two things in life-- you and Château Ratelle.
713,00:39:34,00:39:37,And they both turned out to be fake.
714,00:39:40,00:39:41,"Hey, Russ. Yeah."
715,00:39:41,00:39:44,"You got something? Yeah, I got Sadat's car."
716,00:39:44,00:39:48,"That paint transfer came back to a '95 Ford, stolen yesterday."
717,00:39:48,00:39:52,"Now, patrol just picked up Boyd on Route 16, just east of the Utah state line."
718,00:39:52,00:39:53,What about Christine?
719,00:39:53,00:39:57,Boyd was alone. 200 miles of desert between here and the state line.
720,00:39:57,00:39:59,She could be anywhere.
721,00:39:59,00:40:02,"Did you tell Mac yet? No, I figured I'd tell you first."
722,00:40:02,00:40:08,"I mean, Boyd's at PD, but I don't think it's such a good idea to let Mac in that interrogation room just yet."
723,00:40:08,00:40:10,Or it could be a great idea.
724,00:40:13,00:40:15,"Give us a second, will you?"
725,00:40:21,00:40:23,You know who I am.
726,00:40:23,00:40:25,"Right, Jimmy? I know."
727,00:40:25,00:40:30,I also know that that NYPD badge of yours doesn't mean squat here.
728,00:40:30,00:40:31,Where's Christine?
729,00:40:31,00:40:33,You want something?
730,00:40:33,00:40:35,'Cause I want something.
731,00:40:35,00:40:38,This is not a real good time to play the smart-ass.
732,00:40:38,00:40:39,I'm not playing.
733,00:40:39,00:40:42,"I want out of here, and I want back to New York."
734,00:40:42,00:40:43,You're not going anywhere.
735,00:40:43,00:40:46,"If I don't go back, Christine dies."
736,00:40:46,00:40:49,"You son of a bitch, where is she?"
737,00:40:49,00:40:51,Where is she?! She's in New York.
738,00:40:51,00:40:53,That's why I got to go back.
739,00:40:53,00:40:56,Christine is in New York. She never came to Vegas.
740,00:40:56,00:40:58,What the hell are you talking about?
741,00:40:58,00:41:05,I owe money... to a loan shark back in New York-- enough that he's willing to kill me.
742,00:41:05,00:41:06,What's this have to do with Christine?
743,00:41:06,00:41:09,I needed to use her to pay him off.
744,00:41:09,00:41:19,"How? A few months back, the jeweler Sadat-- he comes into Christine's restaurant, he asks me to introduce him to the owner because he wants to build another place like that in Vegas."
745,00:41:19,00:41:21,Sadat wanted to invest.
746,00:41:21,00:41:31,"I knew that Christine was coming back here, and my... my girlfriend Kim-- she looks exactly like her, so all I had to do was just set up the meet, rip Sadat off..."
747,00:41:31,00:41:33,So the text messages-- you're the one who sent them.
748,00:41:33,00:41:34,You had Christine's phone.
749,00:41:34,00:41:37,"I had her phone, I had the plane reservation, I had the hotel."
750,00:41:37,00:41:42,"I mean, i-it's just supposed to be easy, you know..."
751,00:41:42,00:41:45,Where is she? She's with my brother. My brother has her.
752,00:41:45,00:41:48,"You're going to call him, and you're going to tell him it's over!"
753,00:41:48,00:41:50,"I can't. Don't play with me, Jimmy! Come on!"
754,00:41:50,00:41:53,I... The guy I owe-- he got nervous and he grabbed 'em up.
755,00:41:53,00:41:55,He grabbed 'em up.
756,00:41:55,00:41:57,I don't know where they're at.
757,00:41:57,00:42:02,"Okay, all I know is that, if I don't bring the diamonds tomorrow night, they're dead."
758,00:42:04,00:42:05,They're dead!
759,00:42:16,00:42:21,"I'm taking that bastard back to New York with the diamonds, he's going to pay off the scumbag he owes, I'm gonna get Christine back."
760,00:42:21,00:42:26,"Mac, you can't just hop on a plane with a killer and a bunch of stolen diamonds. I don't have a choice."
761,00:42:26,00:42:28,I don't have time for red tape.
762,00:42:28,00:42:29,"You heard what he said, Russell."
763,00:42:29,00:42:30,She's going to die.
764,00:42:30,00:42:32,"I heard, I heard."
765,00:42:32,00:42:34,I love this woman.
766,00:42:37,00:42:38,She saved my life.
767,00:42:38,00:42:42,I'm not saying don't do this.
768,00:42:42,00:42:44,I'm just saying you're gonna need my help.
769,00:42:45,00:42:47,I'm coming with you.
