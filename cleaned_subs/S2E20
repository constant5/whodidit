7,00:01:01,00:01:03,Welcome to theWild Kingdom.
8,00:01:03,00:01:05,"Vic's Ruth Elliot, 80 years old."
9,00:01:05,00:01:08,"Had at least 20 roommates, all of them feline."
10,00:01:08,00:01:10,Animal Control's rounding them up now.
11,00:01:10,00:01:11,Who alerted Homicide?
12,00:01:11,00:01:13,Mail was piling up.
13,00:01:13,00:01:16,Mailman looked in the window and called 9-1-1.
14,00:01:16,00:01:19,Take a deep breath before you go inside.
15,00:01:19,00:01:23,(indistinct radio transmission)
16,00:01:30,00:01:32,"Oh, God! Ugh!"
17,00:01:32,00:01:36,I didn't think anything could mask the smell of a decomp.
18,00:01:36,00:01:37,Male cat urine.
19,00:01:37,00:01:38,"To us, smelly."
20,00:01:39,00:01:42,"To a female cat, it must be like aftershave."
21,00:01:42,00:01:44,Me-ow.
22,00:01:45,00:01:46,David.
23,00:01:47,00:01:48,You don't look so good.
24,00:01:48,00:01:49,Allergic to cats.
25,00:01:50,00:01:51,"Oh, bummer."
26,00:01:53,00:01:55,Rigor mortis has passed.
27,00:01:55,00:01:56,Lividity is fixed.
28,00:01:56,00:01:58,Extensive marbling on her limbs.
29,00:01:58,00:02:02,She's been dead three or four days and I need a Benadryl.
30,00:02:02,00:02:04,Excuse me.
31,00:02:20,00:02:21,Whoa.
32,00:02:23,00:02:25,She could have died of natural causes.
33,00:02:25,00:02:30,"Three or four days, pets could have been looking for their next meal."
34,00:02:30,00:02:32,Sure. Meat is meat.
35,00:02:33,00:02:34,"(meows, hisses)"
36,00:02:36,00:02:39,Or maybe they turned on her.
37,00:02:50,00:02:52,Whoa.
38,00:02:52,00:02:53,Look at this.
39,00:02:55,00:02:56,Flowing wound.
40,00:02:58,00:03:01,That's a deep wound track.
41,00:03:02,00:03:04,This woman was stabbed.
42,00:03:06,00:03:08,I guess the cats are off the hook.
43,00:03:41,00:03:44,(indistinct radio transmission)
44,00:04:17,00:04:19,Floor was coverd by trash. Lots of partials.
45,00:04:19,00:04:22,Mostly from Animal Control boots.
46,00:04:22,00:04:25,But... I got something here.
47,00:04:25,00:04:28,Distinctive heel and toe.
48,00:04:28,00:04:30,"What, a high heel?"
49,00:04:30,00:04:31,Well...
50,00:04:31,00:04:35,an old lady wears flats or slippers.
51,00:04:35,00:04:39,I can't imagine that this vic entertained.
52,00:04:39,00:04:42,You got to be careful with isolation.
53,00:04:42,00:04:44,It can escalate.
54,00:04:44,00:04:49,"Before you know it, you're the crazy cat lady living in the rundown house."
55,00:04:49,00:04:51,People stop coming by to visit.
56,00:04:51,00:04:57,"You go outside, your neighbors run across the street to get away from you."
57,00:04:57,00:05:00,"Eventually, you stop going out altogether."
58,00:05:00,00:05:04,"Whoo, man! It reeks in here."
59,00:05:04,00:05:05,Who lives like this?
60,00:05:05,00:05:06,Cat lover.
61,00:05:06,00:05:07,You think?
62,00:05:08,00:05:10,"So, what do we know?"
63,00:05:10,00:05:12,"Well, there's no signs of forced entryanywhere."
64,00:05:12,00:05:16,"Well, I can see why somebody would want to rob this place."
65,00:05:16,00:05:17,I'll start in the bedroom.
66,00:06:40,00:06:42,No reaction.
67,00:06:42,00:06:44,Knives are clean.
68,00:06:44,00:06:48,"Well, killer could have brought his own took it with him when he left."
69,00:06:48,00:06:53,"We might want to reconsider ""burglary gone bad."" I found a busted safe in the bedroom. Empty."
70,00:06:53,00:06:54,I lifted prints.
71,00:06:54,00:07:01,WILLOWS: A high-heeled thief who knew exactly what to look for and killed the only obstacle in their path.
72,00:07:03,00:07:05,(indistinct radio transmission)
73,00:07:07,00:07:09,Welcome to a 4-45.
74,00:07:09,00:07:11,Explosives. It's been a while.
75,00:07:11,00:07:12,Fatalities?
76,00:07:12,00:07:15,"Just this $50,000 Beemer."
77,00:07:16,00:07:19,Marcie Tobin. Her car.
78,00:07:19,00:07:24,"And Marcus Remmick, mechanic an eyewitness."
79,00:07:24,00:07:26,"So, divide and conquer?"
80,00:07:26,00:07:27,"Yeah, I'll take the rig."
81,00:07:28,00:07:29,I'll take the grease monkey.
82,00:07:29,00:07:30,I guess I got the driver.
83,00:07:30,00:07:33,MARCIE: This just does that make any sense.
84,00:07:33,00:07:36,"I mean, why would somebody put a bomb in my car?"
85,00:07:36,00:07:37,SIDLE: Ms. Tobin?
86,00:07:37,00:07:39,Hi. I'm with the Crime Lab.
87,00:07:39,00:07:41,Mind if I ask you a few questions?
88,00:07:41,00:07:43,Have you reached my husband?
89,00:07:43,00:07:44,"I'll check on it, ma'am."
90,00:07:44,00:07:47,Thanks.
91,00:07:47,00:07:49,Can you tell me what happened?
92,00:07:49,00:07:51,I was on my way to my father's office.
93,00:07:51,00:07:55,On Thursdays we have dinner and then I help him with his payroll.
94,00:07:55,00:07:57,(clanking)
95,00:07:57,00:07:59,Excuse me?
96,00:07:59,00:08:00,We're closed.
97,00:08:00,00:08:03,My car is making a really strange noise.
98,00:08:03,00:08:05,Take it to the dealership in the morning.
99,00:08:05,00:08:07,Lady's driving a brand-new Beemer.
100,00:08:07,00:08:09,"First service is 15,000 miles."
101,00:08:09,00:08:10,Things don't go wrong.
102,00:08:10,00:08:12,Yeah.
103,00:08:12,00:08:14,"But you checked it out anyway, huh?"
104,00:08:14,00:08:16,You know how women get.
105,00:08:16,00:08:18,"Go ahead, pop the hood."
106,00:08:21,00:08:22,(ticking)
107,00:08:22,00:08:23,Back away.
108,00:08:23,00:08:24,"Why? Run, run!"
109,00:08:25,00:08:26,Why? Run!
110,00:08:31,00:08:34,"Ms. Tobin, where did you last park your car?"
111,00:08:34,00:08:36,"In my house, in my garage."
112,00:08:36,00:08:38,And who would have access?
113,00:08:38,00:08:41,Just me... and my husband.
114,00:08:41,00:08:43,But Johnny had nothing to do with this.
115,00:08:43,00:08:45,He's been at work all day.
116,00:08:45,00:08:47,You can ask him as soon as he gets here.
117,00:08:47,00:08:50,(indistinct radio transmission)
118,00:09:01,00:09:02,Anything probative?
119,00:09:02,00:09:05,Check out this displacement.
120,00:09:08,00:09:10,Detritus blew backwards.
121,00:09:14,00:09:15,Uh-huh.
122,00:09:16,00:09:17,(sighs)
123,00:09:17,00:09:18,That's intentional.
124,00:09:19,00:09:20,Bombs are personal.
125,00:09:20,00:09:22,So...
126,00:09:23,00:09:29,assuming Mrs. Tobin was the intended target the bomber knew what he was doing.
127,00:09:29,00:09:32,"Yeah, a hired hit on a housewife."
128,00:09:32,00:09:34,(indistinct radio transmission)
129,00:09:35,00:09:36,Glad I'm a dog person.
130,00:09:36,00:09:40,"You know, house cats have only been domesticated for 4,000 years."
131,00:09:40,00:09:43,They still have predatory instincts.
132,00:09:43,00:09:44,"Only 4,000?"
133,00:09:44,00:09:45,Yeah.
134,00:09:45,00:09:47,But a cat didn't kill her.
135,00:09:47,00:09:48,You're right.
136,00:09:48,00:09:51,No vital reactions around the bite marks.
137,00:09:51,00:09:53,Predation is all postmortem.
138,00:09:53,00:09:55,"Cause of death, cardiac trauma."
139,00:09:55,00:10:05,"She was stabbed lateral to the sternal border, just below the fifth intercostal space straight into the right ventricle."
140,00:10:05,00:10:08,Muscle layers decrease with age.
141,00:10:08,00:10:11,Fascia and tissue layers are easy to penetrate.
142,00:10:11,00:10:15,Can't tell you much about the weapon but the wound track is slick.
143,00:10:16,00:10:19,I swabbed the foreign substance sent it to Greg.
144,00:10:20,00:10:21,Anything else?
145,00:10:21,00:10:24,"Well, vic's lungs were full of fluid."
146,00:10:24,00:10:28,Probably not relevant to your investigation but the lab cultured her blood.
147,00:10:29,00:10:31,She had a severe staph infection.
148,00:10:31,00:10:33,(phone rings)
149,00:10:33,00:10:35,Grissom.
150,00:10:37,00:10:39,We'll be right there.
151,00:10:39,00:10:41,Homicide has a witness.
152,00:10:41,00:10:44,Tell them what you told me.
153,00:10:45,00:10:47,"Come on, Jessica."
154,00:10:47,00:10:49,What did you see?
155,00:10:49,00:10:54,"Oh, the lady over there the one that died, she was nice."
156,00:10:54,00:10:57,GIRL: She had cats.
157,00:10:57,00:10:58,Lots of them. Yep.
158,00:10:58,00:11:00,My name's Catherine.
159,00:11:00,00:11:02,What is your name again?
160,00:11:02,00:11:03,Jessica Rachel Trent.
161,00:11:03,00:11:04,I'm eight and a half.
162,00:11:04,00:11:07,"Oh, eight and a half so I bet you're in the third grade?"
163,00:11:07,00:11:09,Yeah. My teacher's Mrs. Armstrong.
164,00:11:10,00:11:11,She's really nice.
165,00:11:11,00:11:14,Except I hate multiplication especially the eights.
166,00:11:14,00:11:17,"You know, I have a daughter. She hates the eights, too."
167,00:11:17,00:11:19,"So, Jessica, can you tell me what you told your mom?"
168,00:11:19,00:11:23,I can. Jessica and I were playing handball against the garage door.
169,00:11:23,00:11:27,We saw Mrs. Stein go into Mrs. Elliot's house and they were yelling.
170,00:11:27,00:11:31,When Mrs. Stein came out she looked really angry.
171,00:11:31,00:11:34,Kind of like when Mommy's boyfriend is late for dinner.
172,00:11:34,00:11:35,She hates that.
173,00:11:36,00:11:39,"GRISSOM: And, uh..."
174,00:11:39,00:11:40,who is Mrs. Stein?
175,00:11:40,00:11:43,Mrs. Elliot's next-door neighbor.
176,00:11:43,00:11:45,Ran a background check.
177,00:11:45,00:11:49,The good neighbor filed three nuisance complaints against the victim.
178,00:11:51,00:11:53,"Hey, are you girls sharing secrets?"
179,00:11:53,00:11:54,Can you share it with me?
180,00:11:55,00:11:57,All right.
181,00:12:02,00:12:03,Thank you.
182,00:12:03,00:12:05,No problem.
183,00:12:07,00:12:10,I think that we're done here.
184,00:12:10,00:12:12,Okay. Thanks for your help.
185,00:12:12,00:12:13,Sure.
186,00:12:16,00:12:17,(sighs)
187,00:12:17,00:12:19,I'll get a warrant for Mrs. Stein's shoes.
188,00:12:19,00:12:21,See if we can place her at the crime scene.
189,00:12:22,00:12:25,Don't you have a secret to share with me now?
190,00:12:25,00:12:28,"Oh, uh, Mrs. Stein?"
191,00:12:28,00:12:30,She hates cats.
192,00:12:51,00:12:52,Another spring.
193,00:12:52,00:12:56,Did you know there's a dozen moving parts inside a ticking clock?
194,00:12:56,00:12:58,I do now.
195,00:13:00,00:13:01,Hmm...
196,00:13:01,00:13:03,"Hello, sweetheart."
197,00:13:03,00:13:04,End cap?
198,00:13:04,00:13:06,Pipe bomb.
199,00:13:06,00:13:08,End cap at both ends.
200,00:13:08,00:13:12,Either one could have come in contact with the explosive inside the pipe.
201,00:13:12,00:13:17,I'll swab it see if Trace can identify it.
202,00:13:17,00:13:20,I will see your end cap and raise you a grommet.
203,00:13:20,00:13:24,A grommet? Inside a pipe bomb?
204,00:13:24,00:13:26,"Not in the bomb, itself, but embedded in the end cap."
205,00:13:26,00:13:29,The wires from the timing device enter the pipe through a hole in the grommet.
206,00:13:29,00:13:35,"When the timing device is activated, it sets off an electrical charge that detonates the explosives inside the pipe."
207,00:13:35,00:13:37,Yet the grommet's fully intact.
208,00:13:37,00:13:39,How did it survive the blast?
209,00:13:39,00:13:40,"I don't know, but they always do."
210,00:13:41,00:13:43,And just when I thought you knew everything.
211,00:13:43,00:13:44,BRASS: How's the puzzle?
212,00:13:44,00:13:47,"Hey. Pieces are small, but it's coming together."
213,00:13:47,00:13:48,"Well, I got a corner piece."
214,00:13:48,00:13:50,The 4-1-1 on Marcie Tobin's husband?
215,00:13:50,00:13:54,"Junior foreman on Tobin C &amp;amp; D, Incorporated."
216,00:13:54,00:14:01,"The ""C"" stands for ""construction"" the ""D"" is for ""demolition."" MAN: I got to do my job, you got to do your job."
217,00:14:01,00:14:05,"So, if this stuff isn't taken down there then we all lose."
218,00:14:05,00:14:07,"So, you just make sure that you are in touch with me..."
219,00:14:07,00:14:08,Jonathan Claddon?
220,00:14:09,00:14:10,Yeah.
221,00:14:10,00:14:11,I'm Nick Stokes. This is Sara Sidle.
222,00:14:12,00:14:13,We're with the Vegas Crime Lab.
223,00:14:13,00:14:15,We're here about your wife's car.
224,00:14:15,00:14:16,"Yeah, she told me you might stop by."
225,00:14:16,00:14:19,Mr. Claddon are you a demolitions expert?
226,00:14:19,00:14:20,That's what we do.
227,00:14:20,00:14:22,You must have seen our work on TV.
228,00:14:22,00:14:24,We imploded most of the old Strip hotels.
229,00:14:24,00:14:27,Do you personally know how to make a bomb?
230,00:14:27,00:14:28,It's not hard.
231,00:14:28,00:14:30,Anybody here could show you how.
232,00:14:31,00:14:32,"STOKES: So, I take that as a ""yes""?"
233,00:14:32,00:14:36,If you're implying I had anything to do with all of this...
234,00:14:36,00:14:38,I love my wife.
235,00:14:38,00:14:41,"Not enough, apparently, to be there for her last night."
236,00:14:41,00:14:44,"Johnny, Reynolds needs help loading the truck."
237,00:14:44,00:14:45,These folks are from the Crime Lab.
238,00:14:45,00:14:47,They're here about Marcie.
239,00:14:47,00:14:48,I'd like to talk to them.
240,00:14:48,00:14:51,Alone.
241,00:14:51,00:14:53,"Well, let me know if I can help."
242,00:14:53,00:14:54,Will do.
243,00:14:54,00:14:56,MAN: Oh.
244,00:14:56,00:14:57,Barclay Tobin.
245,00:14:57,00:14:58,This is my company.
246,00:14:58,00:15:00,Any leads on my daughter's case?
247,00:15:00,00:15:02,"At this point, we're still asking questions."
248,00:15:02,00:15:04,Can you tell us about your son-in-law?
249,00:15:04,00:15:07,"Well, I got him his first and only job when he married Marcie."
250,00:15:07,00:15:10,"STOKES: You, uh... you don't think too much of him, huh?"
251,00:15:10,00:15:11,Even less these days.
252,00:15:11,00:15:16,Marcie says that he's cheating on her but I don't think he has the stones.
253,00:15:16,00:15:18,(sighs)
254,00:15:18,00:15:20,But after last night...
255,00:15:20,00:15:22,Does Johnny have access to explosives?
256,00:15:22,00:15:24,All my foremen have access to dynamite.
257,00:15:27,00:15:29,"Mr. Tobin, do you fingerprint your employees?"
258,00:15:29,00:15:30,Sure do.
259,00:15:30,00:15:33,It's standard for the industry.
260,00:15:33,00:15:35,Just let me know what you need.
261,00:15:38,00:15:42,"Before you ask that swab of yours, from the end cap..."
262,00:15:42,00:15:48,"let's play ""Name That Chemical Compound."" Today's category: ""Explosives."" 30 seconds on the clock."
263,00:15:48,00:15:49,Get...
264,00:15:49,00:15:52,(clears throat)
265,00:15:54,00:15:57,C-3...
266,00:15:59,00:16:01,H-5...
267,00:16:03,00:16:06,and three molecules of NO-3...
268,00:16:06,00:16:07,Nitroglycerin.
269,00:16:07,00:16:10,The explosive component of dynamite.
270,00:16:10,00:16:15,"Now, the other component for dynamite is either silica or sawdust."
271,00:16:15,00:16:17,Your sample contains sawdust.
272,00:16:17,00:16:18,"Thanks, Greg."
273,00:16:18,00:16:20,What'd I win?
274,00:17:21,00:17:22,Hey.
275,00:17:22,00:17:23,Hey.
276,00:17:23,00:17:24,"Well, you look..."
277,00:17:24,00:17:25,Happy?
278,00:17:25,00:17:27,"Smug, actually."
279,00:17:27,00:17:30,I got a perfect print off the end cap.
280,00:17:30,00:17:32,Husband.
281,00:17:32,00:17:33,Nice.
282,00:17:33,00:17:37,I got the type of explosive used in the pipe bomb.
283,00:17:37,00:17:39,Dynamite-- nitro and sawdust.
284,00:17:39,00:17:42,The same kind used at Tobin C &amp; D.
285,00:17:42,00:17:43,(chuckles)
286,00:17:43,00:17:44,Mm-hmm...
287,00:17:44,00:17:46,You found the end cap?
288,00:17:46,00:17:47,That's not easy.
289,00:17:47,00:17:51,"Hey, if I were you I'd worry about my fingerprint."
290,00:17:51,00:17:53,How'd it get there?
291,00:17:53,00:17:56,My father-in-law's company is the largest purchaser of end caps in Nevada.
292,00:17:56,00:17:58,I log inventory.
293,00:17:58,00:18:00,"BRASS: Well, speaking of inventory I checked the books."
294,00:18:00,00:18:04,"As you know, per the ATF every stick of dynamite is catalogued."
295,00:18:04,00:18:05,You logged-out a case of 24.
296,00:18:05,00:18:10,When the demolition project was postponed you returned the case...
297,00:18:10,00:18:12,one stick short.
298,00:18:12,00:18:14,It was stolen.
299,00:18:15,00:18:16,"Look, I'm the one who reported the theft."
300,00:18:17,00:18:21,"I kept the dynamite in my SUV, inside a storage magazine."
301,00:18:21,00:18:26,"So, you're telling us someone broke into your vehicle and stole a single stick of dynamite?"
302,00:18:26,00:18:29,Yes.
303,00:18:30,00:18:32,Tell us about your girlfriend.
304,00:18:33,00:18:36,Is that what Mr. Tobin told you?
305,00:18:38,00:18:41,Marcie's the best thing that ever happened to me.
306,00:18:41,00:18:43,"Plus, I've got an ulcer."
307,00:18:43,00:18:45,Do you have any idea what an affair would do to me?
308,00:18:45,00:18:48,I work my butt off for her old man.
309,00:18:48,00:18:52,I barely have enough time to sleep let alone Romeo some other girl.
310,00:18:53,00:18:56,"And the truth is, nothing I ever do is good enough."
311,00:18:56,00:18:59,Tobin wouldn't even let Marcie take my name.
312,00:18:59,00:19:00,"Cry me a river, Johnny."
313,00:19:02,00:19:04,You're looking at the wrong guy.
314,00:19:04,00:19:06,Then point us in the right direction.
315,00:19:08,00:19:14,Marcie handles the payroll and she has a rep for shortchanging overtime.
316,00:19:14,00:19:17,Talk about pissing people off.
317,00:19:17,00:19:20,Any one of those guys could have put that bomb in her car.
318,00:19:20,00:19:23,Why didn't you tell us this before?
319,00:19:23,00:19:24,Because it's not her fault.
320,00:19:24,00:19:27,She's just doing what her father tells her.
321,00:19:42,00:19:44,(knocking)
322,00:19:45,00:19:46,Debbie Stein?
323,00:19:46,00:19:47,Yes.
324,00:19:47,00:19:49,I'm here for your shoes.
325,00:20:23,00:20:24,Phew.
326,00:20:25,00:20:27,Eau decat.
327,00:20:40,00:20:43,Eau dematch.
328,00:20:45,00:20:46,She was a pig.
329,00:20:46,00:20:47,Her house stunk.
330,00:20:48,00:20:50,She didn't belong in the neighborhood.
331,00:20:50,00:20:53,"So, I guess it's safe to say you weren't friends?"
332,00:20:55,00:20:57,Why were you in her house?
333,00:20:58,00:21:02,I wanted to give her a chance to find homes for her cats before I called the Humane Society.
334,00:21:02,00:21:04,To report her.
335,00:21:04,00:21:05,"By law, you can only own three."
336,00:21:05,00:21:08,"Well, a witness heard you scream at her."
337,00:21:08,00:21:10,She was irrational.
338,00:21:11,00:21:12,I was angry.
339,00:21:12,00:21:13,This is disgusting. Nobody lives like this.
340,00:21:14,00:21:15,You've got to get rid of them.
341,00:21:15,00:21:18,"These cats are my children, and no one's going to take them away from me."
342,00:21:18,00:21:19,Then you clean up after them.
343,00:21:20,00:21:22,I can smell your house from my kitchen.
344,00:21:22,00:21:25,"When, exactly, did you confront Mrs. Elliot?"
345,00:21:25,00:21:27,I don't know.
346,00:21:27,00:21:28,Maybe...
347,00:21:28,00:21:30,six days ago.
348,00:21:30,00:21:33,Before my trip to L.A.
349,00:21:33,00:21:35,I went to visit my sister.
350,00:21:35,00:21:40,"Look, if you have any other questions I want a lawyer."
351,00:21:40,00:21:42,You're free to go.
352,00:21:48,00:21:50,"Well, she had an answer for everything."
353,00:21:50,00:21:56,"You know, according to Mark Twain the most striking difference between a cat and a lie is that a cat only hasninelives."
354,00:21:56,00:21:58,What are you saying? That she's lying?
355,00:21:58,00:22:01,Unless her alibi checks out.
356,00:22:20,00:22:24,Bomber fastened the cap to the pipe leaving behind tool marks.
357,00:22:24,00:22:26,Check it out.
358,00:22:26,00:22:31,What kind of tool leaves evenly-spaced vertical striations?
359,00:22:31,00:22:33,A vice grip.
360,00:22:35,00:22:36,A vice grip?
361,00:22:36,00:22:38,Yeah.
362,00:22:38,00:22:42,Let's get a warrant for Johnny Claddon's home and for Tobin C &amp;amp; D.
363,00:22:47,00:22:49,"Hey, guys."
364,00:22:51,00:22:52,WILLOWS: Hey!
365,00:22:52,00:22:53,Talked with O'Riley.
366,00:22:53,00:22:55,The neighbor's alibi doescheck out.
367,00:22:55,00:22:56,She was at her sister's in L.A.
368,00:22:56,00:22:57,during the time of the murder.
369,00:22:58,00:22:59,"Well, there goes our only suspect."
370,00:22:59,00:23:00,Not so fast.
371,00:23:00,00:23:02,I got another one.
372,00:23:02,00:23:06,We have a match on that print that we found on the wall safe.
373,00:23:06,00:23:07,Right!
374,00:23:08,00:23:09,Yeah.
375,00:23:09,00:23:11,He has a non-gaming work card.
376,00:23:11,00:23:12,He's 45 years old.
377,00:23:12,00:23:15,He was an electrician at the Tangiers from '97 to '99.
378,00:23:15,00:23:17,His name is Tyler Elliot.
379,00:23:17,00:23:20,That's the same last name as the vic. Victim's son.
380,00:23:20,00:23:22,Only child.
381,00:23:22,00:23:24,MAN: I wasn't skipping town.
382,00:23:24,00:23:27,O'RILEY: That why you had a duffel bag in the back seat?
383,00:23:27,00:23:30,I was going camping out at Red Rock.
384,00:23:30,00:23:32,"And suddenly, these cops pull me over."
385,00:23:32,00:23:34,They take me into custody.
386,00:23:34,00:23:35,My car's still up there.
387,00:23:36,00:23:39,"Your mother died, and you never claimed the body."
388,00:23:39,00:23:40,How come?
389,00:23:41,00:23:43,Funerals are expensive.
390,00:23:43,00:23:44,I'm broke.
391,00:23:44,00:23:48,O'RILEY: Records show he filed for bankruptcy last month.
392,00:23:48,00:23:51,I figured let the county pick up the tab.
393,00:23:51,00:23:54,No one was going to show up anyway.
394,00:23:58,00:24:00,It's not like we were close.
395,00:24:00,00:24:02,"So, how often didyou see her?"
396,00:24:02,00:24:04,Twice a month.
397,00:24:04,00:24:07,"Went over, made sure her bills got paid."
398,00:24:07,00:24:09,Brought her medication.
399,00:24:09,00:24:11,Stocked the fridge.
400,00:24:11,00:24:13,All the stuff any good son's supposed to do.
401,00:24:14,00:24:18,WILLOWS: Mr. Elliot we found your mother's safe.
402,00:24:18,00:24:21,It was busted open and your prints were all over it.
403,00:24:21,00:24:23,(scoffs)
404,00:24:23,00:24:24,Something funny?
405,00:24:24,00:24:29,"About a month ago, she called me up-- middle of the night-- hysterical."
406,00:24:29,00:24:32,Her precious tabby was locked inside.
407,00:24:32,00:24:35,She couldn't remember the combo.
408,00:24:38,00:24:40,I didn't steal her money.
409,00:24:40,00:24:42,She didn'thaveany.
410,00:24:42,00:24:45,The only thing she owned was the house.
411,00:24:45,00:24:49,And she left that to some damn cat sanctuary.
412,00:24:51,00:24:53,And so...
413,00:24:53,00:24:55,that's it?
414,00:24:56,00:25:01,I'm flat broke and she gives her house to complete strangers.
415,00:25:01,00:25:04,"Can, uh..."
416,00:25:05,00:25:10,can somebody drive me back to my car if we're done?
417,00:25:10,00:25:16,"MARCIE: You know, since my car blew up everybodyis in my business."
418,00:25:16,00:25:18,"All of a sudden, everybody has something to say."
419,00:25:18,00:25:21,"You know, an opinion, a theory."
420,00:25:21,00:25:24,My life is an open book and my father wants me to hire a bodyguard.
421,00:25:24,00:25:25,For what?
422,00:25:26,00:25:27,To protect me from who?
423,00:25:27,00:25:34,You know what I think? Someone put the bomb in the wrong car. I think they confused our house with somebody else's because stranger things have happened. Marcie?
424,00:25:34,00:25:36,Yeah. Sorry.
425,00:25:36,00:25:39,Maybe we should talk alone.
426,00:25:39,00:25:42,"MARCIE: Uh, we don't have any secrets."
427,00:25:42,00:25:44,Okay.
428,00:25:44,00:25:47,Listen-- about your marriage-- your father said...
429,00:25:47,00:25:49,"Oh, my God. My father shouldn't have said anything."
430,00:25:49,00:25:52,Your father ran his mouth about our personal life?
431,00:25:52,00:25:53,"Johnny, you know what? I, um..."
432,00:25:53,00:25:58,A couple of weeks ago I thought that maybe Johnny was fooling around just because he was never home...
433,00:25:58,00:26:00,I was working. and never interested...
434,00:26:00,00:26:04,"Marcie, we talked about this. You know the pressure your father has me under. I know. I know."
435,00:26:04,00:26:06,It's not fair. And you know what?
436,00:26:06,00:26:11,You shouldn't put too much stock in this because every couple has their problems. Marcie and I have had enough.
437,00:26:11,00:26:13,"That's it. Now, you have your warrant, fine."
438,00:26:13,00:26:16,But please no more questions.
439,00:26:16,00:26:18,(Marcie sighs)
440,00:26:18,00:26:20,Just take what you need.
441,00:26:30,00:26:33,Hey. You got a head start.
442,00:26:33,00:26:35,"Yeah, didn't even have to wait for my warrant."
443,00:26:35,00:26:40,"I just rolled over to Tobin C &amp;amp; D and before I could say ""vice grip"" the senior foreman gave me every grip in the house."
444,00:26:40,00:26:41,"Bad news, though. No matches."
445,00:26:41,00:26:46,Ah! One more vice grip compliments of the Tobin/Claddon household.
446,00:27:11,00:27:12,Aw...
447,00:27:12,00:27:15,teeth aren't even the same size.
448,00:27:15,00:27:16,No.
449,00:27:16,00:27:18,And we're out of vice grips.
450,00:27:18,00:27:19,We're out of luck.
451,00:27:19,00:27:21,Let's unwrap the Beemer.
452,00:27:24,00:27:28,"You know, when I was 16, I begged my mom for a car."
453,00:27:28,00:27:29,Swore she'd come through.
454,00:27:29,00:27:30,What happened?
455,00:27:30,00:27:32,Encyclopedia Britannica.
456,00:27:32,00:27:33,(chuckling)
457,00:27:33,00:27:35,All 24 volumes.
458,00:27:35,00:27:37,"Still own them, still use them."
459,00:27:40,00:27:42,Okay.
460,00:27:42,00:27:46,Mechanic found the bomb next to the engine mount closest point to the driver.
461,00:27:46,00:27:47,Bomb was on a delay.
462,00:27:47,00:27:58,"Clock with a ticking second hand and a nail driven into ""12."" That means the bomb was triggered 60 seconds before detonation, one rotation of the second hand."
463,00:27:59,00:28:02,"Question is, what started the clock?"
464,00:28:04,00:28:06,Something Marcie Tobin touched inside the car?
465,00:28:16,00:28:21,"Ignition, door locks window, radio, A/C..."
466,00:28:21,00:28:24,turning signals hazard lights...
467,00:28:24,00:28:27,"Yeah, but we're only dealing with a 60-second time frame."
468,00:28:28,00:28:31,"Okay, she pulls into the lot she gets out of the car, and she asks for help."
469,00:28:31,00:28:33,Mechanic offers to take a look.
470,00:28:33,00:28:35,"So, she pops the hood for him."
471,00:28:38,00:28:39,Hood release.
472,00:28:42,00:28:43,Whoa.
473,00:28:44,00:28:46,The latch has been blown apart.
474,00:28:46,00:28:50,Which means the hood was down when the bomb was detonated.
475,00:28:52,00:28:54,How is that possible?
476,00:28:54,00:28:56,The mechanic saw the bomb.
477,00:28:56,00:28:59,X-ray vision?
478,00:28:59,00:29:01,"Okay, maybe he took one look at it, and he slammed the hood."
479,00:29:01,00:29:05,"Sara, if you found a bomb in your car would you close the hood?"
480,00:29:05,00:29:07,"No, I would back away fast."
481,00:29:07,00:29:10,Um... maybe the hood dropped?
482,00:29:10,00:29:12,No way.
483,00:29:12,00:29:14,BMW has built-in hood shocks.
484,00:29:14,00:29:17,"Liar, liar, car on fire."
485,00:29:40,00:29:43,(music stops)
486,00:29:46,00:29:49,I could have been a rock star.
487,00:29:49,00:29:51,"There's still time, Greg."
488,00:29:52,00:29:55,Tell us about the foreign substance we found in the vic's wound track.
489,00:29:55,00:30:00,"Uh, well, I like to rub it all over a lady's body."
490,00:30:00,00:30:02,Even better...
491,00:30:05,00:30:06,"I, uh..."
492,00:30:06,00:30:10,like it when she rubs it all over me.
493,00:30:10,00:30:13,And it's also used as a stool softener.
494,00:30:13,00:30:15,It's also the only open lead in our case.
495,00:30:15,00:30:16,"Spit it out, Greg."
496,00:30:16,00:30:18,Mineral oil.
497,00:30:18,00:30:21,GRISSOM: Possibly used as a preservative to prevent rusting of high-carbon steel.
498,00:30:21,00:30:24,Like the blades of knives.
499,00:30:24,00:30:27,Old knives. New ones are made from stainless steel.
500,00:30:27,00:30:29,"Yeah, I'm like a sponge."
501,00:30:29,00:30:30,I just absorb information.
502,00:30:30,00:30:32,I thought that wasmyline.
503,00:30:32,00:30:34,"Yeah, and I absorbed it."
504,00:30:34,00:30:35,"Okay, so..."
505,00:30:35,00:30:36,(clears throat)
506,00:30:36,00:30:39,"knives, screwdriver ice pick letter opener."
507,00:30:39,00:30:41,We're looking for a weapon with a splash of mineral oil.
508,00:30:41,00:30:42,I'll grab the A.L.S.
509,00:30:44,00:30:46,An A.L.S. for mineral oil?
510,00:30:46,00:30:52,Mineral oil fluoresces at 525 nanometers when filtered through a KV590.
511,00:30:52,00:30:55,"A little more absorbing, a little less rock and roll."
512,00:30:59,00:31:02,(dog barking)
513,00:31:05,00:31:07,(machine humming)
514,00:31:36,00:31:37,Now what?
515,00:31:38,00:31:40,(meowing)
516,00:31:43,00:31:46,I thought Animal Control rounded up all the cats.
517,00:31:46,00:31:48,Where are you going?
518,00:31:48,00:31:50,Following the evidence.
519,00:31:57,00:31:58,(meows)
520,00:31:58,00:32:00,Wait. Rascal.
521,00:32:01,00:32:02,Hi.
522,00:32:02,00:32:04,(Rascal meows)
523,00:32:04,00:32:05,How'd you get out?
524,00:32:05,00:32:06,Hi. Girls.
525,00:32:07,00:32:08,"Say hi, Rascal."
526,00:32:08,00:32:09,"WILLOWS: Hi, Rascal."
527,00:32:12,00:32:16,"Excuse me, uh... may I hold your cat?"
528,00:32:16,00:32:18,No. He doesn't like you.
529,00:32:19,00:32:22,"Girls, dinner."
530,00:32:22,00:32:24,Can't she see we're playing?
531,00:32:24,00:32:25,Just ignore her.
532,00:32:25,00:32:26,MRS. TRENT: Girls.
533,00:32:27,00:32:29,I see you've met Rascal.
534,00:32:29,00:32:31,"Mrs. Trent, I noticed this cat has a sore on its leg."
535,00:32:31,00:32:33,I'd be happy to swab it for you.
536,00:32:33,00:32:35,Might need medical attention. No.
537,00:32:35,00:32:37,I don't think that that's really necessary.
538,00:32:37,00:32:38,It's just a cut; it'll heal.
539,00:32:38,00:32:42,"But I mean, for your daughter's sake wouldn't you rather be safe than sorry?"
540,00:32:42,00:32:44,I think it's time to go inside.
541,00:32:44,00:32:47,"Uh, Jessica... I-I think he might have a point."
542,00:32:51,00:32:53,I want her to do it.
543,00:32:57,00:33:00,Okay.
544,00:33:00,00:33:02,Rascal.
545,00:33:07,00:33:09,(Rascal meows)
546,00:33:09,00:33:11,All righty.
547,00:33:11,00:33:13,Thank you.
548,00:33:14,00:33:16,"MRS. TRENT: Okay, girls, go wash up."
549,00:33:17,00:33:19,"Come on, Jackie, let's go."
550,00:33:20,00:33:22,"Kids these days, they just don't listen."
551,00:33:22,00:33:24,Two against one.
552,00:33:26,00:33:28,Thank you. See you later.
553,00:33:29,00:33:33,"One thing about my mother even though she was deaf, she was always the boss."
554,00:33:33,00:33:35,Huh. Well...
555,00:33:35,00:33:37,single mom...
556,00:33:37,00:33:38,"juggling a job, a boyfriend."
557,00:33:38,00:33:43,"It's just easier to say yes than no and then eventually, they just stop asking for permission."
558,00:33:43,00:33:46,You want to tell me why I swabbed their cat?
559,00:33:46,00:33:51,That cat has an open sore and a missing patch of fur-- both indicative of possible staph infection.
560,00:33:51,00:33:55,And we know that our victim had a staph infection.
561,00:33:55,00:34:01,Staphylococcus bacteria can jump the species barrier-- be passed from human to animal.
562,00:34:01,00:34:03,"MAN: Guess I must have shut it, then."
563,00:34:03,00:34:06,"I wasn't thinking; I was reacting, you know?"
564,00:34:06,00:34:07,"No harm, no foul."
565,00:34:07,00:34:09,STOKES: No prints. Come again?
566,00:34:09,00:34:13,"Well, if you were pawing all over the hood then your prints should be on it."
567,00:34:13,00:34:14,And they're not.
568,00:34:14,00:34:16,I wear gloves.
569,00:34:16,00:34:17,You're not wearing them now.
570,00:34:17,00:34:20,I wear them most of the time.
571,00:34:20,00:34:23,Mind if we take a look around the garage? Knock yourselves out.
572,00:34:24,00:34:26,(electric tool whirring)
573,00:34:30,00:34:32,Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
574,00:34:32,00:34:34,Mechanics use vice grips?
575,00:34:37,00:34:40,You got any clay? No.
576,00:34:40,00:34:44,Well... we can't just take the tool without a warrant.
577,00:34:47,00:34:48,But...
578,00:34:51,00:34:55,we can improvise.
579,00:34:55,00:34:56,Trash is trash.
580,00:34:56,00:34:58,Cheese. Nice.
581,00:35:02,00:35:06,I'll compare this with our case toolmark.
582,00:35:09,00:35:11,You guys having fun?
583,00:35:11,00:35:12,A blast.
584,00:35:12,00:35:13,"Hey, man..."
585,00:35:14,00:35:15,These yours?
586,00:35:15,00:35:18,Don't use vice grips-- pipe wrench has a better feel.
587,00:35:18,00:35:20,Must belong to one of my mechanics.
588,00:35:20,00:35:21,I'll take the prints on those.
589,00:35:22,00:35:24,"Boy, you just have an answer for everything, don't you?"
590,00:35:24,00:35:25,"Yeah, I guess I do."
591,00:35:50,00:35:53,Striae are identical.
592,00:35:53,00:35:57,Auto Body vice grip was definitely used to tighten the end cap.
593,00:35:57,00:35:59,Mechanic's prints on file?
594,00:35:59,00:36:01,Marcus Remmick. Arrested for fraud in 1994.
595,00:36:01,00:36:04,He was selling used parts as new.
596,00:36:04,00:36:06,"Prints are in AFIS, but they don't match the vice grip."
597,00:36:06,00:36:08,"And, in fact, AFIS drew a blank."
598,00:36:08,00:36:11,Hmm. Then what are you running?
599,00:36:11,00:36:13,I'm running a Tobin C&amp;amp;D database.
600,00:36:13,00:36:14,Oh. Shot in the dark.
601,00:36:14,00:36:16,(beeps)
602,00:36:20,00:36:23,(beeping) Even a shot in the dark hits sometimes.
603,00:36:23,00:36:26,MARCIE: Why would I put a bomb in my car?
604,00:36:26,00:36:31,SIDLE: Not only did you put a bomb in your car-- you made it yourself.
605,00:36:31,00:36:32,Why would I do that?
606,00:36:32,00:36:35,BRASS: The business registration shows that you own 25% of your father's company.
607,00:36:35,00:36:41,So Nevada's a community property state-- you divorce Johnny he becomes a part-owner of Tobin Construction.
608,00:36:41,00:36:43,"That wouldn't sit too well with Dad, would it?"
609,00:36:43,00:36:50,"SIDLE: Butif Johnny goes down for attempted murder, he goes to jail and you get to keep everything, because a criminal can't benefit from his own malfeasance."
610,00:36:50,00:36:53,This is absurd.
611,00:36:53,00:36:58,"You know, for your information, um your mechanic friend lawyered up."
612,00:36:58,00:36:59,Guys with records roll fast.
613,00:37:00,00:37:01,He's not my friend. STOKES: Really?
614,00:37:01,00:37:05,Because we found your prints on a tool at the body shop.
615,00:37:05,00:37:08,It was the same tool we know was used to make the pipe bomb.
616,00:37:11,00:37:13,(quietly): Sit down.
617,00:37:17,00:37:19,SIDLE: You and Marcus tag-teamed us.
618,00:37:19,00:37:22,You never popped the hood; he never shut it-- it was latched.
619,00:37:22,00:37:27,"Fortunately for you, you only worked Thursday nights, because your little plan took a lot of extra time and effort?"
620,00:37:27,00:37:36,"You snagged a stick of dynamite out of Johnny's SUV took an end cap out of inventory, knowing we'd trace it back to Johnny if we found it."
621,00:37:36,00:37:40,"And then at the body shop, you put it all together."
622,00:37:41,00:37:43,So what if I made a bomb?
623,00:37:43,00:37:45,That's not a crime.
624,00:37:45,00:37:46,Really?
625,00:37:46,00:37:48,You sure about that?
626,00:37:53,00:37:56,Ready.
627,00:37:56,00:37:58,MARCIE: 60 seconds.
628,00:38:08,00:38:10,BRASS: You used to own a '92 Volvo.
629,00:38:10,00:38:12,I ran your credit card.
630,00:38:12,00:38:14,"You owe $20,000 in auto body repairs."
631,00:38:14,00:38:16,"Your dad kicked in $30,000."
632,00:38:16,00:38:18,"I ran his credit card, too."
633,00:38:18,00:38:20,That's 50 g's for a leaky transmission.
634,00:38:20,00:38:25,STOKES: You needed Marcus' help to wire the bomb and substantiate your story.
635,00:38:25,00:38:29,"So the two of you paid him $50,000 for services rendered."
636,00:38:29,00:38:38,"Look, I'm fine, and my husband is fine and it was my car that exploded so does this... really need to go any further?"
637,00:38:38,00:38:44,"BRASS: Ma'am, you and your father conspired to frame your husband for attempted murder."
638,00:38:44,00:38:47,"STOKES: So, you're both looking at, what, uh..."
639,00:38:47,00:38:49,20-plus.
640,00:38:50,00:38:53,"Oh, and Johnny's getting a promotion."
641,00:39:04,00:39:06,Girl's cat...
642,00:39:06,00:39:09,positive for staphylococcus.
643,00:39:09,00:39:11,"You know, I spoke with Janet Trent."
644,00:39:11,00:39:13,She and her daughters are all healthy.
645,00:39:13,00:39:16,Could their cat have been infected by Mrs. Elliot?
646,00:39:16,00:39:20,Could Rascal have been her cat at one time?
647,00:39:21,00:39:24,"What, and she..."
648,00:39:24,00:39:25,gave it to the girls? No.
649,00:39:25,00:39:28,"So if it was hers, and she..."
650,00:39:28,00:39:31,didn't give it away...
651,00:39:31,00:39:35,Maybe someone in the Trent house adopted it.
652,00:39:35,00:39:38,(indistinct radio transmission)
653,00:40:27,00:40:31,We know that Mrs. Elliot was killed by this pen.
654,00:40:31,00:40:35,Can one of you tell me what happened?
655,00:40:37,00:40:40,"Girls, do you understand what Ms. Willows is asking you?"
656,00:40:47,00:40:50,I'll tell. No. You promised.
657,00:40:50,00:40:56,"WILLOWS: Jessica, in this room, the only promise you make is to tell the truth."
658,00:40:56,00:40:57,She didn't mean to do it.
659,00:40:57,00:40:59,I'm sure she didn't.
660,00:40:59,00:41:01,Who?
661,00:41:02,00:41:04,Mommy.
662,00:41:11,00:41:14,What did your mother do?
663,00:41:14,00:41:18,Mrs. Elliot should have just given us the cat.
664,00:41:18,00:41:20,He's always at our house.
665,00:41:20,00:41:22,Rascal likes it there.
666,00:41:22,00:41:23,I won't give them away.
667,00:41:24,00:41:25,"Look, then I'll pay you for him."
668,00:41:25,00:41:26,I'm sorry.
669,00:41:26,00:41:29,Every child should have a cat but these are mine.
670,00:41:29,00:41:30,Just give me... Oh!
671,00:41:30,00:41:31,"Girls, take the cat and run."
672,00:41:31,00:41:33,Go. Go.
673,00:41:33,00:41:35,ELLIOT (crying): No! Please... no!
674,00:41:35,00:41:39,"So then we ran, and that's when we heard the old lady scream."
675,00:41:41,00:41:42,Jackie?
676,00:41:45,00:41:46,"Girls, do you..."
677,00:41:46,00:41:48,know about fingerprints?
678,00:41:51,00:42:04,"When you... touch something-- like this floaty pen, for instance-- you leave behind an invisible mark that's special, that's yours."
679,00:42:04,00:42:08,I have a way to...
680,00:42:08,00:42:11,see these invisible marks.
681,00:42:12,00:42:17,And we found these fingerprints on the pen.
682,00:42:18,00:42:21,And they don't belong to an adult.
683,00:42:28,00:42:30,They're not mine.
684,00:42:32,00:42:35,Tattletales burn in hell.
685,00:42:38,00:42:42,The old lady should have just givenmethe cat.
686,00:42:43,00:42:45,I lied before.
687,00:42:45,00:42:47,She wasn't nice.
688,00:42:47,00:42:50,She was mean.
689,00:42:50,00:42:53,My mom said we can keep him. Please?
690,00:42:53,00:42:56,These aremybabies. I don't give them away.
691,00:42:56,00:42:57,But you have so many.
692,00:42:57,00:42:58,We don't have even one.
693,00:42:58,00:42:59,I'm sorry.
694,00:43:03,00:43:05,"Run, Jackie!"
695,00:43:08,00:43:10,I'll tell your mother! You won't!
696,00:43:33,00:43:35,Did you know?
697,00:43:35,00:43:41,I told the girls that they could have a cat ifMrs. Elliot gave them one.
698,00:43:41,00:43:45,I knew she never would.
699,00:43:45,00:43:47,That's why I made the promise.
700,00:43:47,00:43:50,"JESSICA: No, I need Mommy."
701,00:43:50,00:43:53,(crying): Mommy. I want my mommy!
702,00:43:53,00:43:56,No! Jessica!
703,00:43:56,00:43:58,Mommy...
704,00:44:00,00:44:03,(crying): Mommy...
