0,00:00:02,00:00:07,NATE HASKELL: There's a concrete bridge built in 1938.
1,00:00:07,00:00:09,25 feet from there...
2,00:00:09,00:00:12,look west.
3,00:00:12,00:00:14,That's where you'll find Joel.
4,00:00:14,00:00:17,BRASS: His directions to the crime scene were very precise.
5,00:00:17,00:00:21,We found the bones of a male body buried in three feet of dirt.
6,00:00:21,00:00:25,"ECKLIE: The hyoid bone was broken, which indicates death by strangulation, so..."
7,00:00:25,00:00:31,"pending DNA, we're tentatively ID'ing him as Joel Steiner, the first victim of Nate Haskell, the Dick and Jane killer."
8,00:00:31,00:00:34,BRASS: We found another male D.B. in close proximity.
9,00:00:34,00:00:38,ECKLIE: We estimate he's been dead no longer than 24 hours.
10,00:00:39,00:00:40,BRASS: His name is Jeffrey Masters.
11,00:00:40,00:00:42,He was strangled like the others.
12,00:00:42,00:00:44,He has a wife-- Maureen.
13,00:00:44,00:00:47,"She's not at home, she's not answering her cell."
14,00:00:47,00:00:49,"According to friends, the two of them were out clubbing last night."
15,00:00:49,00:00:51,We have a broadcast out.
16,00:00:51,00:00:53,But you're not 100% certain she's actually missing.
17,00:00:53,00:00:56,How are you so sure they're victims of this Dick and Jane killer?
18,00:00:56,00:01:00,"Well, Sheriff, we believe the killer is actually one of his accomplices."
19,00:01:00,00:01:04,DJK's signature is postmortem stab wounds to the male.
20,00:01:05,00:01:06,They're his version of notches on a gun.
21,00:01:06,00:01:09,ECKLIE: Jeffrey Masters was stabbed ten times.
22,00:01:09,00:01:11,He and his wife would be the tenth couple taken overall.
23,00:01:11,00:01:15,"BRASS: The M.O. of the killer is, he usually targets a couple-- a male and female."
24,00:01:15,00:01:22,"ECKLIE: He strangles the male, then dumps the body; BRASS: Takes the female, holds her hostage, tortures her; eventually, he kills her, too."
25,00:01:22,00:01:24,How much time do we have?
26,00:01:24,00:01:25,ECKLIE: It's hard to say.
27,00:01:25,00:01:30,ECKLIE: We placed CSI Grissom undercover in a college seminar in which Haskell was being interviewed.
28,00:01:30,00:01:35,Haskell implied that he kept one of his female vics alive for three days.
29,00:01:35,00:01:37,"The general rule of thumb is, we probably have less than 48 hours."
30,00:01:37,00:01:41,This is quite the PR crapper you've dumped me in.
31,00:01:41,00:01:50,"LVPD and the Crime Lab run some kind of a sting operation in a class about serial killers, and the serial killer uses it to reach out from behind bars and kill again?"
32,00:01:50,00:01:53,Want to know how you can make it up to me?
33,00:01:53,00:01:55,Find the girl.
34,00:02:27,00:02:29,A new body at the site of his first kill can't be a coincidence.
35,00:02:29,00:02:32,I think that Nathan Haskell somehow got a message to someone.
36,00:02:32,00:02:35,"No, I agree-- I spoke to the warden at Ely."
37,00:02:35,00:02:41,"The only communication Haskell's had with the outside world in the last 48 hours was the phone call to Langston, and that seminar you were in."
38,00:02:41,00:02:48,"Also, Sheriff Burdick wants to start a task force about this, and he's asked me to ask you to stay on-- so I'm asking."
39,00:02:48,00:02:50,"Okay, I have an answer."
40,00:02:50,00:02:52,I'll keep you informed.
41,00:02:52,00:02:54,LANGSTON: Tell us your definition of fun.
42,00:02:54,00:02:58,Fun is taking something away from somebody.
43,00:03:00,00:03:03,"Oh, you never forget your first."
44,00:03:03,00:03:05,(woman groans quietly)
45,00:03:13,00:03:15,(groans louder)
46,00:03:15,00:03:18,(TV playing in distance)
47,00:03:34,00:03:36,(exhales gently)
48,00:03:44,00:03:47,GAME SHOW HOST: Welcome back toQuestion the Answer!
49,00:03:47,00:03:49,Dana's our current leader and has control. (door squeaks open)
50,00:03:49,00:03:53,"Okay, it looks like you've been the jumper today, jumping all over the board."
51,00:03:53,00:03:55,"What's your category, Dana?"
52,00:03:55,00:03:56,"DANA: How about ""Happiness"" for $800."
53,00:03:56,00:03:59,"HOST: And ""Happiness"" for $800 it is."
54,00:03:59,00:04:10,"Okay, Dana: ""In the central nervous system, ""this plays an important role in modulation of happiness."" Can you... Question the Answer?"
55,00:04:10,00:04:12,DANA: What is the thalamus?
56,00:04:12,00:04:14,"THE KILLER (with TV host): I'm sorry, that's wrong."
57,00:04:14,00:04:19,Serotonin is a chemical that produces happiness in a person.
58,00:04:19,00:04:21,"HOST: When serotonin is released, happiness is the result."
59,00:04:21,00:04:22,"Yes, it is."
60,00:04:22,00:04:25,"(grunting, gasping)"
61,00:04:27,00:04:29,"ECKLIE: Yes, sir."
62,00:04:29,00:04:31,Absolutely.
63,00:04:31,00:04:34,Okay. (chuckles) I will.
64,00:04:35,00:04:36,Okay.
65,00:04:37,00:04:39,Come in.
66,00:04:39,00:04:40,I need a favor.
67,00:04:40,00:04:43,It's something you're going to have to clear with the sheriff.
68,00:04:45,00:04:47,"What, do you have bugs in my office?"
69,00:04:47,00:04:49,No.
70,00:04:49,00:04:52,I have bugs inmyoffice.
71,00:04:53,00:04:54,What?
72,00:04:54,00:04:56,What are we talking about?
73,00:04:56,00:04:59,Sheriff Burdick is reorganizing the department.
74,00:05:00,00:05:03,"From now on, the crime lab will report directly to him."
75,00:05:04,00:05:06,He just made me the new undersheriff.
76,00:05:07,00:05:09,"Congratulations, Conrad."
77,00:05:11,00:05:13,And I have a great idea for your first official act.
78,00:05:14,00:05:17,"Dr. Langston, I was just going to call you."
79,00:05:17,00:05:18,Oh.
80,00:05:20,00:05:21,"I'll, uh, save you the trouble."
81,00:05:22,00:05:24,Come on in.
82,00:05:30,00:05:33,Huh. What's on your mind?
83,00:05:33,00:05:37,"When I was doing my background research on Haskell, I found something very interesting."
84,00:05:38,00:05:41,"Now, as you pointed out in class, he's five-ten, 160 pounds."
85,00:05:41,00:05:44,Most of his male victims were over 200 pounds.
86,00:05:44,00:05:50,"One was a football player, uh, one was a Black Belt, but none of them had defensive wounds and none of them were bound."
87,00:05:50,00:05:54,"Now, most people respond to being strangled by fighting back."
88,00:05:54,00:05:55,Unless they're already unconscious.
89,00:05:55,00:05:57,Exactly.
90,00:05:57,00:06:02,"My feeling is that DJK subdued them first, and I doubt it was using some kind of stranglehold, that would've left bruises."
91,00:06:03,00:06:06,"Well, all the male vics had THC in their system."
92,00:06:06,00:06:10,But even the most potent cannabis would not completely incapacitate an able-bodied man.
93,00:06:10,00:06:13,"So, maybe DJK was using something stronger."
94,00:06:13,00:06:17,Something mixed in with the dope.
95,00:06:17,00:06:22,"GHB, diphenhydramine, salvinorin A, fentanyl...?"
96,00:06:22,00:06:26,Any of these in the proper dosage would render a subject incapable of fighting back.
97,00:06:26,00:06:29,"I thought if you could ID it, it might be helpful."
98,00:06:29,00:06:31,"I realize that this might be a long shot, but I..."
99,00:06:31,00:06:32,"No, no, no."
100,00:06:32,00:06:34,We'll try. I'll take this to Tox.
101,00:06:34,00:06:36,Okay.
102,00:06:37,00:06:40,Dr. Grissom...
103,00:06:40,00:06:42,I don't like feeling like an accomplice to murder.
104,00:06:42,00:06:44,You told me you'd keep me in the loop on this.
105,00:06:44,00:06:46,I intend to hold you to that.
106,00:06:46,00:06:47,You don't have to.
107,00:06:47,00:06:51,I've arranged with the lab to retain your services as a special consultant.
108,00:06:52,00:06:53,"I mean, we need all the good brains we can find."
109,00:06:54,00:06:55,What do you think?
110,00:06:55,00:06:57,"Oh, I'm in."
111,00:06:57,00:06:58,I have a theory of my own.
112,00:06:58,00:07:00,Tell me.
113,00:07:00,00:07:04,I think that Haskell's accomplice was someone from your class.
114,00:07:07,00:07:09,Whose idea was it to talk to Haskell?
115,00:07:10,00:07:12,"Uh, one of my students from last semester..."
116,00:07:12,00:07:14,Dan Forester.
117,00:07:14,00:07:22,"BRASS: Okay, so how does a clean-cut, good-natured PhD student like yourself end up writing letters to a serial killer in jail?"
118,00:07:23,00:07:27,"Well, maximum security felons aren't allowed unsolicited phone calls."
119,00:07:27,00:07:29,You look like a smart kid.
120,00:07:29,00:07:30,Don't be a smart-ass.
121,00:07:30,00:07:34,"Well, I was tired of secondary sources."
122,00:07:34,00:07:43,"I mean, there's only so much you can learn about the emotional dynamics of psychopaths from books and psychologists, retired police officers reliving their past glories."
123,00:07:43,00:07:48,"I wanted first-hand material, (over speaker): and that's what I told Professor Langston."
124,00:07:48,00:07:49,He thought it was an outstanding idea.
125,00:07:49,00:07:51,Is that true?
126,00:07:51,00:07:52,"Unfortunately, yes."
127,00:07:52,00:07:54,BRASS: Why did you pick Haskell?
128,00:07:54,00:07:56,"Well, he was the only one with a response."
129,00:07:56,00:07:58,We sent letters to about half a dozen. Hmm.
130,00:07:59,00:08:00,You recognize these people?
131,00:08:00,00:08:02,"FORESTER: Uh, no."
132,00:08:02,00:08:04,How about these people?
133,00:08:06,00:08:08,No. No?
134,00:08:08,00:08:11,"Okay, how about now? Uh..."
135,00:08:11,00:08:16,Nate Haskell somehow managed to kill at least three people from inside his cell.
136,00:08:16,00:08:18,That means he has an accomplice on the outside.
137,00:08:19,00:08:21,Me?
138,00:08:21,00:08:24,You can't possibly believe that I had anything to do with this.
139,00:08:24,00:08:25,"I'm not a suspect, am I?"
140,00:08:25,00:08:30,"BRASS: Well, it was your ""outstanding idea."" Well, I may have misrepresented that slightly."
141,00:08:30,00:08:36,"Now, I don't know whose idea it was first, but we were all having coffee after class last term, and several of us drafted that letter."
142,00:08:37,00:08:42,"I suppose, yeah, I may have been the one that personally took it to Professor Langston, but he redrafted it and sent it to Haskell."
143,00:08:43,00:08:44,Who were the other students? I need their names.
144,00:08:44,00:08:45,I don't know.
145,00:08:46,00:08:47,You don't know.
146,00:08:47,00:08:48,"Sincerely, I don't remember."
147,00:08:48,00:08:49,I...
148,00:08:51,00:08:53,Are these people really dead?
149,00:08:53,00:08:55,Courtesy of your pen pal.
150,00:08:55,00:08:57,"So, what do we do next?"
151,00:08:57,00:09:00,Do we interview everyone that was in the class?
152,00:09:00,00:09:03,"Well, even if we can find them all, there must be 50 students."
153,00:09:03,00:09:05,I don't think Maureen Masters has that kind of time.
154,00:09:05,00:09:11,GRISSOM: We have to figure out who Haskell was communicating with.
155,00:09:12,00:09:15,Maybe we can see for ourselves.
156,00:09:15,00:09:18,GRISSOM: Ever had the feeling you were being watched?
157,00:09:21,00:09:26,"Even in a crowded room, someone making eye contact with you, just for a second, triggers a powerful response."
158,00:09:26,00:09:31,"It's the brain filtering through a mass of visual information, telling you what's important."
159,00:09:31,00:09:32,WILLOWS: Yeah...
160,00:09:32,00:09:34,like which predator wants to eat you.
161,00:09:34,00:09:40,"If Haskell was communicating with someone in this class, I'm betting that they made eye contact with each other."
162,00:09:40,00:09:41,More than once.
163,00:09:41,00:09:43,Are we going to try to match eye lines with the students?
164,00:09:44,00:09:48,LANGSTON: The University wouldn't allow the students' side to be recorded for liability and security reasons.
165,00:09:48,00:09:50,Okay-- there.
166,00:09:50,00:09:52,We thought he said this to Mrs. Steiner.
167,00:09:52,00:09:54,He's clearly talking to his accomplice.
168,00:09:54,00:09:58,Joel was the first.
169,00:09:58,00:10:02,"Joel lives in the perfect place, the place where it all began."
170,00:10:02,00:10:05,"If I could get out of here, believe me, I would bring him some company."
171,00:10:05,00:10:07,Pretty clear now what Haskell meant by that.
172,00:10:07,00:10:08,I'll loop it.
173,00:10:09,00:10:10,Joel was the first.
174,00:10:11,00:10:14,"Joel lives in the perfect place, the place where it all began."
175,00:10:14,00:10:18,"And if I could get out of here, believe me, I would bring him some company."
176,00:10:18,00:10:22,"If I could get out of here, believe me, I would bring him some company."
177,00:10:24,00:10:26,GRISSOM: Mrs. Steiner was standing right there.
178,00:10:26,00:10:29,It's hard to tell who he's really talking to.
179,00:10:30,00:10:33,SANDERS: Anything else he say stand out?
180,00:10:33,00:10:36,"Yes, um..."
181,00:10:36,00:10:37,Try two-and-half minutes in.
182,00:10:37,00:10:40,Someone asked how he selected his victims.
183,00:10:42,00:10:43,Did you ever buy a car?
184,00:10:44,00:10:49,"You go down to the showroom, you're pretty sure you're going to get one, but why the red one, why not the blue one?"
185,00:10:49,00:10:56,"Nobody knows, but just one of them speaks to you, and... that's the one you gotta have."
186,00:10:56,00:11:02,"Nobody knows, but just one of them speaks to you, and.... that's the one you gotta have."
187,00:11:03,00:11:05,He's looking right here.
188,00:11:07,00:11:08,Dan Forester.
189,00:11:08,00:11:10,Brass already interviewed him.
190,00:11:10,00:11:13,We don't think he's our guy.
191,00:11:13,00:11:18,"You know, if you're already a serial killer's accomplice, why take a class about serial killing?"
192,00:11:18,00:11:22,SANDERS: Maybe because he screwed up with Ian and Justine.
193,00:11:22,00:11:23,Big time.
194,00:11:25,00:11:29,SANDERS: Did anyone ask Haskell for any pointers?
195,00:11:29,00:11:31,Um...
196,00:11:31,00:11:36,"Try four hours, 23 minutes in."
197,00:11:36,00:11:40,Someone asked him how he was able to manage to control his victims.
198,00:11:43,00:11:44,You have to give them hope.
199,00:11:44,00:11:56,"If you bring a human being to the brink of death, and then you offer a chance-- no matter how small a chance-- to survive..."
200,00:11:56,00:11:59,they'll grab it.
201,00:11:59,00:12:02,And they'll thank you for it.
202,00:12:02,00:12:06,And then you can do whatever you want.
203,00:12:06,00:12:08,And believe me...
204,00:12:08,00:12:11,I did.
205,00:12:12,00:12:14,Thomas Donover.
206,00:12:16,00:12:17,Let's see if we can find Thomas.
207,00:12:33,00:12:35,(knocking loudly)
208,00:12:38,00:12:40,Hallie Donover? Yes.
209,00:12:40,00:12:42,Where's your husband? He ain't in there.
210,00:12:42,00:12:43,He-He... He's gone... He's gone camping.
211,00:12:43,00:12:44,Where?
212,00:12:44,00:12:45,"Um, Mount Charleston."
213,00:12:45,00:12:48,"He goes to Red Rock Canyon, different places, I don't know."
214,00:12:49,00:12:50,OFFICER: All clear.
215,00:12:50,00:12:51,What's going on?
216,00:12:51,00:12:52,BRASS: Where's your husband work?
217,00:12:52,00:12:54,"Right now, kind of nowhere."
218,00:12:54,00:12:55,Hm.
219,00:12:55,00:12:56,"No, sir, but he's in construction."
220,00:12:56,00:12:58,"You know, these day's the city's pretty dead."
221,00:12:58,00:13:00,But he's going back to school.
222,00:13:00,00:13:02,"Yeah, we know that."
223,00:13:02,00:13:04,So you have absolutely no idea where your husband is?
224,00:13:05,00:13:06,"No, sir. No."
225,00:13:06,00:13:09,"Tom goes camping a lot, and he doesn't always tell me where he's going."
226,00:13:09,00:13:11,"I don't ask, so..."
227,00:13:11,00:13:15,You always keep tabs on your wife?
228,00:13:15,00:13:16,Yeah. That's why I'm divorced.
229,00:13:19,00:13:20,Everybody take a room.
230,00:13:20,00:13:24,We're looking for anything that tells us where Tom Donover could be.
231,00:13:26,00:13:28,(camera shutter clicking)
232,00:13:40,00:13:44,Shoe tread's a match to Tolliver's house and Justine in the desert.
233,00:13:44,00:13:46,This is definitely our guy.
234,00:13:46,00:13:48,His browser history is clean.
235,00:13:48,00:13:51,The laptop is filled with encrypted files.
236,00:13:51,00:13:52,I'm going to get it back to the lab.
237,00:13:52,00:13:55,But this guy knows how to cover his tracks.
238,00:14:03,00:14:05,BRASS: Do you have your cell phone on you?
239,00:14:05,00:14:07,Why? Let's get it on; let's call your husband up.
240,00:14:07,00:14:09,We need to talk to him.
241,00:14:17,00:14:19,"Yeah, you're welcome to try it, if you like."
242,00:14:19,00:14:22,Tom turns his cell phone off when he's camping.
243,00:14:22,00:14:25,"He likes his alone time, so..."
244,00:14:25,00:14:27,HASKELL: You have to give them hope.
245,00:14:27,00:14:36,"If you bring a human being to the brink of death, and then you offer a chance-- no matter how small a chance-- to survive, they'll grab it."
246,00:14:36,00:14:39,And they'll thank you for it.
247,00:14:39,00:14:42,And then you can do whatever you want.
248,00:14:46,00:14:47,Please.
249,00:14:49,00:14:51,Just don't kill me.
250,00:15:02,00:15:05,I'm going to give you a little rest.
251,00:15:07,00:15:08,"No, don't!"
252,00:15:15,00:15:16,You can relax.
253,00:15:16,00:15:20,You act like I'm going to turn you into the Joker or something.
254,00:15:26,00:15:28,(blades scraping)
255,00:15:39,00:15:41,No! No!
256,00:15:44,00:15:46,The only way through that door is to break it down.
257,00:15:46,00:15:48,I've locked us both in here on purpose.
258,00:15:48,00:15:49,There are a few windows around.
259,00:15:49,00:15:55,"You could probably try those, but that would be dangerous, because I would shoot you in the back of the head."
260,00:15:59,00:16:02,Um... uh...
261,00:16:02,00:16:04,I'm sorry.
262,00:16:04,00:16:06,It won't happen again.
263,00:16:06,00:16:09,The only way out of here alone is dead.
264,00:16:09,00:16:12,The only way out of here alive is with me.
265,00:16:12,00:16:18,"Now, if you behave, you do what I say, and you make me happy..."
266,00:16:18,00:16:21,you'll get out of here just fine.
267,00:16:22,00:16:26,I'll make you happy.
268,00:16:26,00:16:28,I'll do whatever it takes.
269,00:16:30,00:16:33,Good.
270,00:16:33,00:16:37,"Now, when we do leave, I can't be seen with you looking like this."
271,00:16:37,00:16:39,You need to make yourself presentable.
272,00:16:46,00:16:48,"Well, this sure feels familiar."
273,00:16:48,00:16:52,"You, me, a serial killer..."
274,00:16:52,00:16:53,Who's he?
275,00:16:53,00:16:54,Dr. Ray Langston.
276,00:16:54,00:16:57,He's an expert on the Dick and Jane killer and he's a consultant on the case.
277,00:16:57,00:17:00,We usually don't need a consultant.
278,00:17:00,00:17:05,"When the team gets a case like this, we go into hyperdrive."
279,00:17:06,00:17:08,It's why we get up in the morning.
280,00:17:08,00:17:10,I can't imagine my life without it.
281,00:17:10,00:17:11,And you are?
282,00:17:11,00:17:13,David Hodges. Trace.
283,00:17:13,00:17:15,Pleasure to meet you.
284,00:17:15,00:17:17,Likewise.
285,00:17:17,00:17:21,So the red flags are the original DJK body dumps?
286,00:17:21,00:17:22,LANGSTON: Correct.
287,00:17:22,00:17:24,The green ones are Tom Donover's?
288,00:17:24,00:17:25,That's correct.
289,00:17:25,00:17:26,What are the white flags?
290,00:17:26,00:17:29,The last places the victims were seen alive.
291,00:17:29,00:17:33,"They were all abducted in Arizona, Nevada and California."
292,00:17:33,00:17:37,But the male bodies were all found here in Nevada.
293,00:17:37,00:17:41,"You know, Joel Steiner was last seen at the Desert Rose Arena."
294,00:17:41,00:17:45,His body was found 40 miles away just off the 215.
295,00:17:45,00:17:49,"Couple number two was last seen in Bullhead, Arizona."
296,00:17:49,00:17:51,And the male body was found just off the 93.
297,00:17:52,00:17:57,"He dumped the male bodies like... like they were trash, like he wasn't really interested in them."
298,00:17:57,00:18:02,GRISSOM: Maybe he dumped them where it was convenient-- on the road to somewhere else.
299,00:18:10,00:18:12,LANGSTON: Lake Mead?
300,00:18:12,00:18:15,The only problem is Lake Mead has 550 miles of shoreline.
301,00:18:15,00:18:18,I can cut that in half.
302,00:18:20,00:18:24,Greg foundDidymodon nevadensis on the bottom of Tom Donover's sneaker.
303,00:18:24,00:18:29,That moss only grows on the north side of Lake Mead.
304,00:18:31,00:18:32,This is what we live for.
305,00:19:09,00:19:11,"Hey, I was checking the attic."
306,00:19:12,00:19:16,A lot of dust-- but a box was recently disturbed with a bunch of VHS tapes in it.
307,00:19:16,00:19:19,"DVD player, stacks of DVDs."
308,00:19:20,00:19:22,No VCR.
309,00:19:22,00:19:24,I'm listening.
310,00:19:24,00:19:29,"Well, Gerald Tolliver had a VCR at his house, but no tapes."
311,00:19:29,00:19:30,And we know he took souvenirs.
312,00:19:30,00:19:34,I found concert ticket stubs from the summer of '97.
313,00:19:34,00:19:36,This tape was made about the same time.
314,00:19:36,00:19:39,I want to get this back to the lab.
315,00:19:39,00:19:41,You look exhausted-- why don't you let me take care of that.
316,00:19:41,00:19:44,"No, no, no."
317,00:19:44,00:19:46,I'm fine. I'll push through it.
318,00:19:46,00:19:48,It's just...
319,00:19:48,00:19:51,"It feels like Grissom's last big game, you know."
320,00:19:55,00:19:57,I want to win it for him.
321,00:20:00,00:20:02,BRASS: Recognize this guy?
322,00:20:02,00:20:04,How about him?
323,00:20:04,00:20:05,That's uh... that's Gerry Tolliver.
324,00:20:05,00:20:07,"He's an old friend of Tom's from Reno, I think."
325,00:20:07,00:20:11,"Right. Kind of friend always putting the arm on you for money when you're doing okay, you know?"
326,00:20:11,00:20:13,Uh-huh. He's a sleazy guy.
327,00:20:13,00:20:14,"No, what he is, is he's dead."
328,00:20:14,00:20:17,He's dead; so's that guy-- they're both dead.
329,00:20:17,00:20:21,So's this guy and this guy... and all these guys here.
330,00:20:21,00:20:23,They're all dead.
331,00:20:23,00:20:25,"See, your husband's a murderer."
332,00:20:25,00:20:26,Where is he?
333,00:20:26,00:20:30,"Do yourself a favor, tell me-- where is he?!"
334,00:20:30,00:20:34,But he made me promise not to tell.
335,00:20:49,00:20:51,(phone ringing)
336,00:20:51,00:20:52,Tox.
337,00:20:52,00:20:54,"Hey, Henry, it's Catherine."
338,00:20:54,00:21:01,Grissom said that you were testing tissue samples from the DJK victims for the presence of some incapacitating agent?
339,00:21:01,00:21:03,Yes. Actually I just finished.
340,00:21:03,00:21:05,Dr. Langston was right.
341,00:21:05,00:21:08,They all showed high levels of...
342,00:21:08,00:21:09,Salvinia divinorum?
343,00:21:09,00:21:12,Usually Grissom does that.
344,00:21:12,00:21:13,Are you bucking for a promotion?
345,00:21:14,00:21:15,"Yes or no, Henry."
346,00:21:15,00:21:16,Sorry.
347,00:21:16,00:21:17,It's an intense hallucinogenic.
348,00:21:17,00:21:20,It'll knock you on your ass for 15 to 30 minutes.
349,00:21:36,00:21:39,"Mandy, it's Catherine."
350,00:21:39,00:21:41,"The print I just sent through, it's priority one."
351,00:21:41,00:21:44,We're looking for anyone who might lead us to Tom Donover.
352,00:21:44,00:21:47,"If you get a hit, get it to Brass ASAP."
353,00:21:52,00:21:57,"OFFICER: 2-0-3-Charlie, this is 3-David-34 coming up on a pedestrian fitting your description."
354,00:21:57,00:21:58,"3-David-34, that's him on the left."
355,00:21:58,00:22:00,Let's grab him. Let's grab him.
356,00:22:01,00:22:03,"(siren whoops, tires screech)"
357,00:22:09,00:22:14,"Control, this is 3-David-34 in foot pursuit of one male Caucasian, east on Fremont."
358,00:22:14,00:22:16,Requesting backup.
359,00:22:18,00:22:19,(siren whoops)
360,00:22:20,00:22:22,(siren whoops intermittently)
361,00:22:35,00:22:36,(heavy sigh)
362,00:22:38,00:22:40,"Oh, man."
363,00:22:48,00:22:52,ANDREWS: It appears that the drug dealer was pretty heavy into his own inventory.
364,00:22:52,00:22:56,His tox was positive for THC and opiates.
365,00:22:56,00:23:00,"Fresh red around the needle marks, and they were oozing when he was brought in."
366,00:23:00,00:23:02,This guy shot up less than 24 hours ago.
367,00:23:02,00:23:03,Did you check his urine?
368,00:23:03,00:23:07,"Yes. Urine-heroin levels were 3,000 nanograms per milliliter."
369,00:23:08,00:23:12,The half-life of heroin in the system is 24 hours.
370,00:23:12,00:23:17,"So, when Jeffrey Masters was murdered, and Maureen was kidnapped, he had to have at least twice that amount in him."
371,00:23:17,00:23:20,"He wouldn't have been able to stand up, let alone help."
372,00:23:20,00:23:22,Which makes him another dead end.
373,00:23:23,00:23:24,Guys.
374,00:23:25,00:23:26,You gotta see this.
375,00:23:26,00:23:30,"Oh, my God! That was awesome!"
376,00:23:30,00:23:34,"I cannot believe you got those tickets, baby! MAN: Of course I got them."
377,00:23:34,00:23:37,"Thank you, thank you, for our almost-getting- married present."
378,00:23:37,00:23:39,STOKES: Got this video from Tom Donover's attic.
379,00:23:39,00:23:42,That's Joel Steiner and his fiancÃ©e Tiffany Cohen.
380,00:23:42,00:23:43,DJK's first victims.
381,00:23:44,00:23:46,11 years ago. The night they disappeared.
382,00:23:46,00:23:48,STOKES: Right.
383,00:23:48,00:23:51,WILLOWS: That's Tom Donover...
384,00:23:51,00:23:53,andGerald Tolliver.
385,00:23:53,00:23:57,(talking indistinctly and laughing)
386,00:23:57,00:24:00,I think I got something that'll keep the party going over here.
387,00:24:00,00:24:03,"And the ""something"" is probably a joint laced withSalvia."
388,00:24:03,00:24:05,Yeah. Gerald likes souvenirs.
389,00:24:05,00:24:08,I'm guessing that Tom probably grabbed this videotape after he killed him.
390,00:24:08,00:24:10,Could bewhy he killed him.
391,00:24:10,00:24:12,Keep watching.
392,00:24:14,00:24:16,(woman shuddering in fear)
393,00:24:18,00:24:19,(clattering)
394,00:24:20,00:24:22,(woman screaming)
395,00:24:22,00:24:24,I'll do whatever you say.
396,00:24:24,00:24:26,I know you will.
397,00:24:26,00:24:27,WILLOWS: That's Nate Haskell.
398,00:24:27,00:24:28,(woman screams)
399,00:24:28,00:24:30,STOKES: That's all there is.
400,00:24:30,00:24:33,We got a better view of the house?
401,00:24:33,00:24:36,We know that Tom was continuing in DJK's work.
402,00:24:36,00:24:39,It would make sense that he would carry it out in the same place.
403,00:24:39,00:24:45,"Certain places hold a special power for some people-- Stonehenge, the pyramids."
404,00:24:45,00:24:49,That house could have the same kind of power for Tom.
405,00:24:49,00:24:50,Could be his sacred ground.
406,00:24:50,00:24:52,His wife said that he went camping a lot.
407,00:24:52,00:24:56,Bet that's his favorite spot. Mm.
408,00:24:56,00:24:58,STOKES: That's as good as it gets.
409,00:24:58,00:25:02,We checked Nate Haskell and Tom Donover for property titles.
410,00:25:02,00:25:05,Neither one of them owns anything in Lake Mead.
411,00:25:05,00:25:07,Maybe the house belonged to one of their relatives.
412,00:25:07,00:25:09,"Well, that could take you forever to run that down."
413,00:25:09,00:25:10,Have Archie pull stills of the house.
414,00:25:10,00:25:16,Get them to every local unit in the area; have them check with real estate offices; see if anybody can recognize it.
415,00:25:16,00:25:18,Recognize what?
416,00:25:18,00:25:20,A house with a window in it?
417,00:25:20,00:25:25,"Maureen Masters is running out of time, and the only person who can get us to where she is is Nate Haskell."
418,00:25:25,00:25:27,This is the most fun Haskell's had in a decade.
419,00:25:29,00:25:31,He's not going to help us.
420,00:25:31,00:25:32,It's a waste of time.
421,00:25:32,00:25:34,What we're doing now is a waste of time.
422,00:25:43,00:25:50,"...'cause when I took those women, they stopped being somebody's sister or daughter or fiancÃ©e."
423,00:25:51,00:25:53,They became what I wanted them to be.
424,00:25:53,00:25:54,(blade scrapes)
425,00:25:58,00:26:01,I don't want to die.
426,00:26:01,00:26:07,"It could just be our little secret, and I won't say anything, I promise."
427,00:26:07,00:26:09,Don't do this!
428,00:26:15,00:26:18,"Oh, God... no!"
429,00:26:18,00:26:22,"(gasping, screaming)"
430,00:26:30,00:26:32,It's a shame to hide that face behind this hair.
431,00:26:36,00:26:39,I don't like it.
432,00:26:39,00:26:42,Uh... um...
433,00:26:42,00:26:43,What is that?
434,00:26:46,00:26:47,What are you doing?
435,00:26:47,00:26:50,I'm going to finish your haircut.
436,00:27:06,00:27:09,Marco...
437,00:27:12,00:27:14,Marco...
438,00:27:16,00:27:31,"You're supposed to say ""Polo."" Strange time to be stargazing, don't you think?"
439,00:27:31,00:27:40,"Ansel Adams often forgot when he took his photographs, so a bunch of astronomers tried to figure it out using the image itself."
440,00:27:40,00:27:51,"By referencing the moon's position in relationship to known landmarks and lunar azimuth tables, they were able to determine the date and time the photo was taken."
441,00:27:51,00:27:53,I thought we could reverse the science.
442,00:27:53,00:27:56,We know whenthis was made.
443,00:27:56,00:27:58,Maybe the moon can tell us where.
444,00:27:58,00:28:00,Forensic astronomy?
445,00:28:06,00:28:12,I will never forget the things you've taught me.
446,00:28:14,00:28:16,"You're the best student I ever had, Nick."
447,00:28:19,00:28:22,Let's see if we can figure this out.
448,00:28:52,00:28:54,(wand beeps)

453,00:29:21,00:29:23,"(chains rattling, footsteps approaching)"
454,00:29:30,00:29:33,"Professor Langston, how good to see you."
455,00:29:33,00:29:35,What brings you here?
456,00:29:36,00:29:39,I came...
457,00:29:39,00:29:41,to gloat.
458,00:29:48,00:29:50,Please.
459,00:29:50,00:29:52,"Come in, Nate."
460,00:29:59,00:30:05,We got these from a videotape of one of your kills.
461,00:30:05,00:30:08,"It's hard to believe, isn't it?"
462,00:30:08,00:30:15,"Now, in all fairness, you did say that only dummies take souvenirs, and Gerald Tolliver was a pretty dumb guy."
463,00:30:15,00:30:18,Maybe that's why Tom Donover killed him.
464,00:30:18,00:30:26,"I've been thinking that maybe that's the reason Tom Donover decided to follow in your footsteps, and carry on with the work."
465,00:30:27,00:30:36,"Anyway, none of that really matters now, because, as you can see, we found your house in Lake Mead, and..."
466,00:30:36,00:30:38,we have Tom. and the girl.
467,00:30:38,00:30:39,She's alive.
468,00:30:39,00:30:41,Then what do you need me for?
469,00:30:41,00:30:43,Closure.
470,00:30:43,00:30:47,You once told me that you'd been thinking about it a lot.
471,00:30:47,00:30:50,"Well, I've been thinking about it, too."
472,00:30:51,00:30:55,"I need you to tell us where the girls' bodies are buried, Nate."
473,00:30:55,00:30:56,Us?
474,00:30:56,00:30:58,So you're working with that cop now?
475,00:30:58,00:31:00,We're gonna find them eventually.
476,00:31:00,00:31:01,You know that.
477,00:31:01,00:31:06,"We'll dig, we'll dredge the lake, we'll tear that house of yours down to the studs, if we have to."
478,00:31:06,00:31:08,Now why don't you save us the trouble?
479,00:31:08,00:31:10,Tell me what I need to know.
480,00:31:10,00:31:12,"Look, maybe I can get something out of it for you."
481,00:31:12,00:31:17,"Like what, you're gonna reduce two consecutive life terms down to one?"
482,00:31:17,00:31:24,"Like, maybe I can guarantee that this isn't the last conversation you'll have with someone who isn't shoving your food through a hole in the door."
483,00:31:24,00:31:27,"I promise you, Nate, you don't tell me what I need to know..."
484,00:31:28,00:31:33,...the only person who will hear the sound of your voice ever again...
485,00:31:33,00:31:35,is going to be you.
486,00:31:42,00:31:44,You follow the fence in the backyard.
487,00:31:44,00:31:45,To where?
488,00:31:46,00:31:49,"To where, what?"
489,00:31:49,00:31:52,There is no fence in the backyard.
490,00:31:53,00:31:58,You thought you could make me slip up and give you something you want.
491,00:31:58,00:32:01,You thought you could get inside my head.
492,00:32:01,00:32:02,Get him out of here.
493,00:32:02,00:32:06,A person has to do what I've done to understand me.
494,00:32:06,00:32:07,You have no idea what I've started.
495,00:32:08,00:32:10,"I'm a teacher, too, and my students are everywhere."
496,00:32:10,00:32:13,"They're out there, and I've cut them free."
497,00:32:13,00:32:14,Get him out of here.
498,00:32:14,00:32:15,They're spreading the word.
499,00:32:15,00:32:19,"By the time you find them, it'll be too late, because it'll be just more blood on your hands."
500,00:32:19,00:32:21,She's already dead.
501,00:32:21,00:32:22,Get him out of here!
502,00:32:22,00:32:23,(taunting): She's already dead.
503,00:32:31,00:32:34,(clattering) GRISSOM: That's it.
504,00:32:34,00:32:37,"All right, I can sharpen that up."
505,00:32:43,00:32:49,"Gris, I just, uh, want you to know how much I appreciate you putting me out in the field."
506,00:32:49,00:32:54,I'm sure there were times you wish I probably didn't.
507,00:32:54,00:32:58,Well... you changed my life.
508,00:33:00,00:33:01,STOKES: Hey.
509,00:33:01,00:33:04,Got the moonrise tables for Lake Mead.
510,00:33:10,00:33:12,It's not gonna get much better than this.
511,00:33:14,00:33:16,So the moon is waning gibbous.
512,00:33:16,00:33:21,"On June 15, 1997, the moon rose at 7:46 p.m."
513,00:33:21,00:33:24,This video was recorded at 10:41 p.m.
514,00:33:25,00:33:27,That's two hours and 55 minutes after moonrise.
515,00:33:27,00:33:31,That puts it about 45 degrees above the eastern horizon.
516,00:33:31,00:33:35,So that view is west to east.
517,00:33:37,00:33:42,"You know, those peaks look like they're roughly the same height."
518,00:33:42,00:33:45,I've got the topo map.
519,00:33:45,00:33:50,Look for two peaks that are approximately the same elevation with that geographic relationship.
520,00:33:51,00:33:52,(typing)
521,00:33:52,00:34:00,"Arch Mountain, 3,335 feet, and Hamblin Mountain, 3,310."
522,00:34:00,00:34:02,Fits the bill.
523,00:34:02,00:34:06,The moss on Tom Donover's shoes can only be found on the north side of the lake.
524,00:34:07,00:34:08,So...
525,00:34:08,00:34:14,draw a vector from the center of those two peaks to the north shore.
526,00:34:17,00:34:18,(typing)
527,00:34:28,00:34:30,Black Mesa.
528,00:34:30,00:34:32,"(crying, whimpering)"
529,00:34:35,00:34:38,"(crying, whimpering)"
530,00:34:40,00:34:43,(alarm blaring)
531,00:34:43,00:34:47,"MAUREEN: If you let me go right now, I won't tell anybody what happened."
532,00:34:54,00:34:55,You can't!
533,00:34:55,00:34:57,I did everything that you asked!
534,00:34:57,00:34:58,"Sorry, I lied. (screams)"
535,00:35:09,00:35:11,OFFICER: Move! Move! Move!
536,00:35:11,00:35:12,Guns down! (whimpering)
537,00:35:15,00:35:17,Okay. You're okay.
538,00:35:17,00:35:19,"You're all right, Maureen. You okay? OFFICER: Clear!"
539,00:35:19,00:35:20,There we go.
540,00:35:20,00:35:22,"It's okay, it's okay. (crying)"
541,00:35:22,00:35:24,"It's okay, Maureen. Okay, look at me."
542,00:35:24,00:35:25,(over radio): This is Sniper One.
543,00:35:25,00:35:27,I saw pink mist. Do you copy?
544,00:35:27,00:35:29,This is Brass. Suspect is down.
545,00:35:29,00:35:31,Code four. (distant sirens wailing)
546,00:35:31,00:35:33,Copy that. We're coming in. All right.
547,00:35:33,00:35:35,(quietly): It's all right.
548,00:35:35,00:35:37,"(slow, mournful theme plays)"

556,00:37:13,00:37:17,A penny for your thoughts?
557,00:37:17,00:37:20,He was sitting right there.
558,00:37:21,00:37:24,He was looking at me; I was looking at him.
559,00:37:24,00:37:26,All I saw was...
560,00:37:26,00:37:28,another student.
561,00:37:30,00:37:33,That's allIsaw.
562,00:37:33,00:37:37,I guess I'm tired of getting fooled.
563,00:37:37,00:37:38,"People lie, Professor."
564,00:37:38,00:37:41,The only thing we can count on is the evidence.
565,00:37:41,00:37:44,Thank you for letting me help.
566,00:37:44,00:37:46,It was something I...
567,00:37:46,00:37:49,"Well, it was something I really needed to do."
568,00:37:52,00:37:54,Hey.
569,00:37:56,00:37:58,(sighs)
570,00:37:58,00:38:02,I don't know if you'd have any interest...
571,00:38:02,00:38:06,but we have a job position open at our lab.
572,00:38:07,00:38:10,You're serious?
573,00:38:13,00:38:16,(chuckles): I can't imagine myself as a cop.
574,00:38:16,00:38:17,We're not cops.
575,00:38:17,00:38:19,We come from a wide variety of backgrounds.
576,00:38:20,00:38:22,You're a medical doctor; you're totally qualified.
577,00:38:22,00:38:25,It's an entry-level position.
578,00:38:25,00:38:29,"The hours are terrible, the pay's bad..."
579,00:38:29,00:38:32,"But money's not exactly the object, is it?"
580,00:38:32,00:38:34,I think you'd be a great help to CSI.
581,00:38:36,00:38:39,And you might really enjoy it.
582,00:38:41,00:38:42,I'll think on it.
583,00:39:12,00:39:14,Okay.
584,00:39:14,00:39:16,So this is really real.
585,00:39:18,00:39:20,Fine.
586,00:39:20,00:39:27,"Then, as your friend and colleague, I feel it is my obligation to inform you what a colossal mistake you're making."
587,00:39:27,00:39:28,Hodges...
588,00:39:28,00:39:31,Guys like us don't just get to hang it up.
589,00:39:31,00:39:34,This job is who we are.
590,00:39:34,00:39:36,We are the thin blue line between order and chaos.
591,00:39:36,00:39:40,"You take yourself out of the equation, who knows what's gonna happen?"
592,00:39:40,00:39:42,That's the Butterfly Effect.
593,00:39:42,00:39:43,You taught me that.
594,00:39:43,00:39:46,The bad guys will win more if we don't have you.
595,00:39:47,00:39:52,Who is Watson without Sherlock Holmes?
596,00:39:52,00:39:55,Watson was a genius in his own right.
597,00:39:59,00:40:02,It's the right time for me to go.
598,00:40:05,00:40:07,Okay.
