0,00:00:04,00:00:07,"(siren wailing, men arguing indistinctly)"
1,00:00:12,00:00:14,Thought we were going back to your place.
2,00:00:14,00:00:15,"MAN: Babe, just relax, it's cool."
3,00:00:15,00:00:18,I just got to pick up a little package.
4,00:00:18,00:00:19,(cell phone dings) That's it.
5,00:00:19,00:00:20,It's her again.
6,00:00:21,00:00:22,I'm so screwed.
7,00:00:23,00:00:24,"Okay, just tell her you're with me."
8,00:00:24,00:00:25,"Yeah, right."
9,00:00:25,00:00:27,"Abby, she's not even your real mother."
10,00:00:29,00:00:30,"You know what, just give me the phone."
11,00:00:30,00:00:31,I have a few things that I want to say to her.
12,00:00:31,00:00:32,Cash and phones.
13,00:00:33,00:00:34,Hand them over.
14,00:00:34,00:00:35,"Okay, screw you, buddy."
15,00:00:35,00:00:36,"I said, hand them over."
16,00:00:36,00:00:37,"Oh, my God."
17,00:00:37,00:00:39,"Okay, man, look, just chill, just relax."
18,00:00:39,00:00:40,Now!
19,00:00:42,00:00:43,Slade!
20,00:00:43,00:00:44,Stop!
21,00:00:44,00:00:46,Slade!
22,00:00:47,00:00:48,Slade!
23,00:00:48,00:00:50,(gun fires) (gasps)
24,00:00:56,00:00:58,"Abby, come on!"
25,00:01:13,00:01:14,Miss?
26,00:01:15,00:01:16,Can you hear me?
27,00:01:17,00:01:18,Miss?
28,00:01:20,00:01:22,Are you okay?
29,00:01:27,00:01:28,Can you tell me what happened?
30,00:01:29,00:01:30,Sara Sidle.
31,00:01:32,00:01:35,I need to talk to Sara Sidle.
32,00:01:40,00:01:41,What happened?
33,00:01:41,00:01:42,"I don't know, she's not talking."
34,00:01:42,00:01:43,You want me to call her folks?
35,00:01:43,00:01:45,She's in foster care. How do you know her?
36,00:01:45,00:01:46,Old case.
37,00:01:46,00:01:49,"When Abby was five, her father shot the whole family, then turned the gun on himself."
38,00:01:49,00:01:51,She was the only survivor.
39,00:01:51,00:01:52,"God, that's horrible."
40,00:01:56,00:01:57,Hey.
41,00:01:58,00:01:59,Are you all right?
42,00:01:59,00:02:00,Yeah.
43,00:02:00,00:02:01,You're okay? Mm-hmm.
44,00:02:02,00:02:04,"So, what's going on here?"
45,00:02:04,00:02:07,"You're hanging around the alphabets, standing over the body of a dead guy."
46,00:02:07,00:02:08,He pulled a gun on us.
47,00:02:08,00:02:10,"""Us""? Slade?!"
48,00:02:10,00:02:11,You were down here with Slade?!
49,00:02:11,00:02:13,"Abby, I told you that kid is bad news."
50,00:02:13,00:02:14,"Sara, please, I..."
51,00:02:14,00:02:15,Did he shoot this guy?
52,00:02:15,00:02:16,Listen to me.
53,00:02:18,00:02:20,I finally remember something.
54,00:02:20,00:02:22,From ten years ago.
55,00:02:25,00:02:27,My father didn't do it.
56,00:03:07,00:03:09,"SIDLE: She's fine, we'll see you soon."
57,00:03:09,00:03:10,Uh-huh.
58,00:03:10,00:03:11,"Okay, bye."
59,00:03:12,00:03:14,Joanna's on her way.
60,00:03:14,00:03:16,"As soon as you give your statement, you can go home."
61,00:03:16,00:03:19,But we need to talk about my father.
62,00:03:19,00:03:21,I told you-- I think he's innocent.
63,00:03:21,00:03:26,"Abby, you always told me that you didn't remember anything about what happened that night."
64,00:03:26,00:03:27,I didn't.
65,00:03:27,00:03:30,"But after Slade shot that guy, I smelled something."
66,00:03:30,00:03:33,"Uh, a chemical, kind of like kerosene but not."
67,00:03:33,00:03:36,I smelled the exact same thing the night my family was killed.
68,00:03:36,00:03:38,"You mean, inside the tent?"
69,00:03:39,00:03:44,"When I smelled it, it's like I was right back there."
70,00:03:45,00:03:46,I'd just been shot.
71,00:03:46,00:03:48,My head was bleeding.
72,00:03:48,00:03:50,He picked me up.
73,00:03:50,00:03:52,That's when I smelled it.
74,00:03:52,00:03:54,When he was putting me into my sleeping bag.
75,00:03:54,00:03:55,SIDLE: Your father? ABBY: No.
76,00:03:55,00:03:57,This man had a beard.
77,00:03:57,00:03:58,It wasn't my father.
78,00:03:58,00:04:02,I am telling you-- someone else was there that night.
79,00:04:02,00:04:03,He killed my family.
80,00:04:03,00:04:04,Tried to kill me.
81,00:04:04,00:04:05,My father didn't do it.
82,00:04:05,00:04:07,"Okay, all right, listen, I..."
83,00:04:08,00:04:13,"I know you want to believe that your father is innocent, but the evidence..."
84,00:04:13,00:04:14,I know what I saw.
85,00:04:14,00:04:16,"Abby, you were five years old."
86,00:04:16,00:04:19,"You'd been shot, you saw your mother and your sister killed."
87,00:04:19,00:04:20,That kind of trauma ...
88,00:04:20,00:04:23,can play tricks on your mind.
89,00:04:23,00:04:25,I'm not making this up.
90,00:04:25,00:04:26,"Abby, I..."
91,00:04:30,00:04:34,I thought you of all people would believe me.
92,00:04:43,00:04:45,Joanna.
93,00:04:45,00:04:46,Oh.
94,00:04:46,00:04:47,Cream and sugar.
95,00:04:47,00:04:48,Thank you.
96,00:04:49,00:04:51,"Abby's just, uh, giving her statement."
97,00:04:51,00:04:55,"Uh, I'm really glad she reached out to you."
98,00:04:56,00:04:58,She's 15.
99,00:04:58,00:04:59,You're her mom.
100,00:05:00,00:05:02,It's a complicated relationship.
101,00:05:02,00:05:06,I don't think she really thinks of me as her mother.
102,00:05:09,00:05:12,"Ever since we started the adoption process, she's been acting out."
103,00:05:14,00:05:16,"Breaking curfew, skipping school..."
104,00:05:16,00:05:18,She loves you and Brian.
105,00:05:19,00:05:23,"She's been through so much, huh?"
106,00:05:25,00:05:28,Sometimes I'm amazed that she's done as well as she has.
107,00:05:28,00:05:31,"Well, I-I think that's because of you."
108,00:05:31,00:05:34,You two have a very special bond.
109,00:05:35,00:05:37,I'm so glad you're part of her life.
110,00:05:38,00:05:39,Thank you.
111,00:05:40,00:05:41,"I am, too."
112,00:05:47,00:05:48,I'll be right back.
113,00:05:51,00:05:52,"Hey, Slade!"
114,00:05:52,00:05:55,"What the hell is wrong with you, taking Abby to that part of town?"
115,00:05:57,00:05:57,"Yo, you see that?"
116,00:05:57,00:05:58,I didn't see anything.
117,00:05:58,00:06:00,She is not your girlfriend anymore.
118,00:06:00,00:06:03,"You come near her again, and my face is gonna be the last thing you will ever see."
119,00:06:09,00:06:10,Let's go.
120,00:06:12,00:06:13,Hey.
121,00:06:13,00:06:14,That the guy from the alley?
122,00:06:14,00:06:15,Uh-huh.
123,00:06:18,00:06:19,(sniffs)
124,00:06:20,00:06:21,Greg?
125,00:06:21,00:06:23,Yeah.
126,00:06:23,00:06:24,What are you doing?
127,00:06:25,00:06:27,Tell me what you smell.
128,00:06:29,00:06:30,(sniffs)
129,00:06:30,00:06:31,Urine.
130,00:06:31,00:06:33,Booze.
131,00:06:33,00:06:35,And years without a shower.
132,00:06:35,00:06:36,Why?
133,00:06:36,00:06:38,I smell smoke.
134,00:06:38,00:06:40,Like he's been around a fire.
135,00:06:40,00:06:43,"Yeah, well, he was probably trying to stay warm."
136,00:06:43,00:06:45,Why are you so interested in how he smells?
137,00:06:45,00:06:47,"It's not me, it's Sara."
138,00:06:47,00:06:49,"Uh, this guy was killed mugging a young girl."
139,00:06:49,00:06:53,She smelled something on him that reminded her of a crime scene from ten years ago.
140,00:06:53,00:06:55,Was the case unsolved?
141,00:06:55,00:06:56,Ruled a murder-suicide.
142,00:06:56,00:06:58,Youngest daughter survived.
143,00:06:58,00:07:01,Now she thinks her father might have been innocent.
144,00:07:01,00:07:02,He's pretty ripe.
145,00:07:02,00:07:05,It's gonna be hard to isolate one particular smell.
146,00:07:06,00:07:09,Sounds like a job for the Cyranose 320.
147,00:08:44,00:08:47,"Abby, I'm gonna take a sample of your DNA."
148,00:08:48,00:08:49,Doesn't hurt.
149,00:08:49,00:08:54,"I'm just gonna put this swab against your cheek, like this."
150,00:09:01,00:09:02,Here we go.
151,00:09:04,00:09:06,Good job.
152,00:09:12,00:09:15,"They're dead, aren't they?"
153,00:09:17,00:09:19,I'm sorry.
154,00:09:21,00:09:25,"Abby, did you see what happened?"
155,00:09:25,00:09:27,Who hurt you and your family?
156,00:09:27,00:09:29,I don't remember.
157,00:09:29,00:09:31,That's okay.
158,00:09:31,00:09:34,What's the last thing that you do remember?
159,00:09:34,00:09:37,Mommy and Daddy.
160,00:09:37,00:09:39,They were fighting.
161,00:09:39,00:09:41,Then what happened?
162,00:09:42,00:09:44,I don't remember.
163,00:09:45,00:09:47,That's okay.
164,00:09:47,00:09:50,I want my mommy.
165,00:09:51,00:09:52,I know.
166,00:09:54,00:09:56,Of course you do.
167,00:09:56,00:09:57,It's okay.
168,00:10:02,00:10:03,SANDERS: Sara?
169,00:10:05,00:10:06,"Hey, Sara."
170,00:10:10,00:10:12,"Got the, uh, results on your Cyranose 320."
171,00:10:12,00:10:14,Your mugger was a smelly guy.
172,00:10:14,00:10:16,Over 20 different scents on him.
173,00:10:16,00:10:18,Most of them were pretty common.
174,00:10:18,00:10:20,"Alcohol, smoke, urine."
175,00:10:20,00:10:22,Abby said it was something that she hadn't smelled in ten years.
176,00:10:22,00:10:25,"Like kerosene, or something."
177,00:10:26,00:10:27,Could've been gun cleaner.
178,00:10:27,00:10:28,We found traces of that on him.
179,00:10:28,00:10:29,Huh.
180,00:10:29,00:10:33,I didn't smell any of that at the scene ten years ago.
181,00:10:33,00:10:34,"Not on the gun, not on the father."
182,00:10:34,00:10:37,Was there evidence of another gun used?
183,00:10:37,00:10:38,No.
184,00:10:38,00:10:41,Firearms confirmed that every shot came from the father's gun.
185,00:10:41,00:10:45,"Well, someone could've brought the smell with him into the tent."
186,00:10:45,00:10:46,Stinky stuff.
187,00:10:46,00:10:48,"I mean, it gets on your hands, your clothes..."
188,00:10:48,00:10:56,"So it's possible that someone who smelled like gun cleaner went into the tent, used the father's gun and wiped out the whole family."
189,00:10:56,00:10:59,Abby... could be right.
190,00:10:59,00:11:01,Maybe her father didn't do it.
191,00:11:02,00:11:05,I know that you're pretty tight with this girl.
192,00:11:05,00:11:08,I know you've stayed in touch through all these years.
193,00:11:08,00:11:10,She needed somebody to look after her.
194,00:11:10,00:11:13,We've worked a lot of cases where kids lost their parents.
195,00:11:13,00:11:14,Yeah...
196,00:11:14,00:11:20,"but one parent killing another, getting shipped off to foster care..."
197,00:11:21,00:11:23,That's something I know a little bit about.
198,00:11:26,00:11:31,"In all the years we've been friends, we've never really talked about what happened with your dad."
199,00:11:31,00:11:34,"And I don't mean to pry, but..."
200,00:11:34,00:11:35,You know what happened.
201,00:11:37,00:11:39,They had a volatile relationship.
202,00:11:40,00:11:41,And...
203,00:11:41,00:11:43,(phone buzzes)
204,00:11:49,00:11:51,It's Russell.
205,00:11:57,00:12:01,"According to my case sheet, you have 12 open cases."
206,00:12:01,00:12:01,Is that right?
207,00:12:01,00:12:03,More or less. More or less.
208,00:12:03,00:12:09,So then why are you ordering evidence from long-term storage for a case that was closed ten years ago?
209,00:12:09,00:12:13,"Uh, new evidence was brought to my attention and, uh, I wanted to give the case another look."
210,00:12:13,00:12:15,"Well, then, you should've come to me first."
211,00:12:15,00:12:18,I-I just wanted to see if what I was told had any merit.
212,00:12:18,00:12:19,All right.
213,00:12:20,00:12:22,Where are you getting your new information?
214,00:12:22,00:12:23,Abby Fisher.
215,00:12:23,00:12:25,The girl that survived?
216,00:12:25,00:12:30,She smelled gun cleaner and it brought back a memory of the night that her family was murdered.
217,00:12:30,00:12:32,She thinks that there was someone else there.
218,00:12:32,00:12:38,"Eyewitness accounts, especially years after the fact, are unreliable, and you know that."
219,00:12:38,00:12:39,There's more.
220,00:12:39,00:12:48,"Uh, I looked at her dad's tox report and there was a substantial amount of alcohol found in his system, but there were other peaks on the GC that were never analyzed."
221,00:12:49,00:12:51,Doc ruled this a suicide.
222,00:12:51,00:12:53,So you know what you're asking?
223,00:12:53,00:13:00,"By reopening this case, you're asking Doc to change the manner of death and I just don't see him doing that, not with what you've given me."
224,00:13:00,00:13:04,"Russell, Abby has believed that her father was a murderer her entire life."
225,00:13:04,00:13:08,"If there's a chance that he wasn't, we owe it to her to find that out."
226,00:13:09,00:13:10,This girl lost her whole family.
227,00:13:11,00:13:13,She has no one to fight for her.
228,00:13:14,00:13:18,"Please, let me just take a look at it."
229,00:13:20,00:13:21,"All right, fine."
230,00:13:21,00:13:22,Take a look at it.
231,00:13:22,00:13:24,"But wait, hold on."
232,00:13:24,00:13:26,"Look, this is going to ruffle a lot of feathers."
233,00:13:26,00:13:28,"Not just Doc; Ecklie, too."
234,00:13:28,00:13:30,"So for my sake, you'd better be right."
235,00:13:33,00:13:33,I know.
236,00:13:38,00:13:45,Let me get this straight: Sara is accusing me of cutting corners on my examination of Mr. Fisher?
237,00:13:45,00:13:46,"No, Doc."
238,00:13:46,00:13:51,"In light of new information, Sara just wants to take a look at the case in a different context."
239,00:13:53,00:13:54,All right.
240,00:13:54,00:13:57,Mr. Fisher died from a contact gunshot wound to the right temple.
241,00:13:57,00:14:05,"There was gunshot residue on his right hand, his gun was found beside him, and he had a blood tox level of .23."
242,00:14:05,00:14:09,"Tell me, please, what is it about this that doesn't indicate suicide?"
243,00:14:09,00:14:14,"In the tox report, Sara found a peak from the GC that was never analyzed."
244,00:14:14,00:14:16,Got that tox report right here.
245,00:14:16,00:14:18,What peak are we talking about?
246,00:14:18,00:14:19,RUSSELL: That one.
247,00:14:19,00:14:20,ROBBINS: That's minor.
248,00:14:20,00:14:22,It has the same retention time as ibuprofen.
249,00:14:22,00:14:30,"That's why it wasn't analyzed. Could be, but you can't be sure unless you do a Mass Spec, so please, Doc, just pull the blood for me."
250,00:14:30,00:14:31,Retest it.
251,00:14:32,00:14:34,Sure.
252,00:14:40,00:14:41,ROBBINS: Sorry.
253,00:14:41,00:14:42,You and Sara are out of luck.
254,00:14:42,00:14:45,Those samples were destroyed three years ago.
255,00:14:46,00:14:51,"D.B., if you feel this strongly about it, the only choice is to exhume the body."
256,00:14:55,00:14:56,You're digging up my father?
257,00:14:56,00:14:58,"Well, we need to do some additional testing."
258,00:15:00,00:15:01,Then what happens to him?
259,00:15:01,00:15:03,He'll be re-buried.
260,00:15:03,00:15:05,Like a second funeral?
261,00:15:05,00:15:07,"Well, there won't be a service or anything."
262,00:15:07,00:15:09,He'll just be returned to his grave.
263,00:15:12,00:15:14,I didn't get to go to his funeral.
264,00:15:16,00:15:18,Or Mom's.
265,00:15:18,00:15:20,Or Hannah's.
266,00:15:20,00:15:22,You were still in the hospital.
267,00:15:23,00:15:24,Did you?
268,00:15:25,00:15:27,Go to your father's funeral?
269,00:15:27,00:15:28,No.
270,00:15:30,00:15:31,Why not?
271,00:15:31,00:15:32,I wasn't allowed.
272,00:15:35,00:15:36,Do you miss him?
273,00:15:38,00:15:39,Yeah.
274,00:15:40,00:15:41,I do.
275,00:15:49,00:15:52,Guy looks pretty good for being in the ground for ten years.
276,00:15:52,00:15:54,Miracle of embalming.
277,00:15:54,00:15:55,Mm-hmm.
278,00:15:55,00:15:58,"So, are you gonna do a full autopsy?"
279,00:15:58,00:15:59,It's not necessary.
280,00:15:59,00:16:04,"Barry Fisher died from a gunshot wound to the head, and nothing is going to change that fact."
281,00:16:04,00:16:08,"Well, something caused the peak on the GC."
282,00:16:08,00:16:12,"If he was under the influence of some type of drug, then maybe his death wasn't a suicide."
283,00:16:12,00:16:22,"If that's the case, I will change my ruling to ""undetermined."" Well, good thing he was autopsied."
284,00:16:22,00:16:23,Kept the organs in a plastic bag.
285,00:16:23,00:16:28,I'm just glad the mortuary kept them in the bag after they embalmed him.
286,00:16:28,00:16:30,Organs weren't exposed to formaldehyde.
287,00:16:30,00:16:36,Best bet for identifying acute dose of a drug is the liver or the kidney.
288,00:16:46,00:16:47,Barry Fisher was drugged.
289,00:16:47,00:16:50,Tox found trichloroethanol in his liver sample.
290,00:16:51,00:16:53,"A metabolite of chloral hydrate, right?"
291,00:16:53,00:16:54,That's what the peak was.
292,00:16:54,00:16:55,It wasn't ibuprofen.
293,00:16:55,00:16:56,It was a knockout drug.
294,00:16:57,00:17:03,"Doc changed the manner of death from ""suicide"" to ""undetermined."" You were right."
295,00:17:04,00:17:05,Okay.
296,00:17:06,00:17:07,Where are we?
297,00:17:07,00:17:08,Well...
298,00:17:08,00:17:11,chloral hydrate is not a recreational drug.
299,00:17:11,00:17:13,Fisher wouldn't have taken it voluntarily.
300,00:17:13,00:17:15,So somebody drugged him.
301,00:17:15,00:17:20,"Doc didn't find any injection marks on Fisher's body, but there were remnants of paper cups in the fire pit."
302,00:17:20,00:17:22,The drug could've been put into his drink.
303,00:17:22,00:17:29,Why would somebody incapacitate the husband if they were already planning on shooting him?
304,00:17:30,00:17:31,Maybe to get the gun?
305,00:17:32,00:17:37,"I mean, if the plan was to murder the family and frame the father, the killer would have had to use his gun."
306,00:17:37,00:17:39,Fisher would not have handed it over willingly.
307,00:17:39,00:17:41,"Boy, somebody sure hated the Fishers."
308,00:17:41,00:17:43,Kill the whole family?
309,00:17:43,00:17:45,Those two little girls?
310,00:17:45,00:17:46,I'll see if they had any enemies.
311,00:17:47,00:17:48,So...
312,00:17:48,00:17:50,do I have the okay to...
313,00:17:50,00:17:52,officially reopen the case?
314,00:17:53,00:17:54,You bet.
315,00:17:56,00:18:00,"When Doc ruled it a suicide, I boxed up all of the evidence because there wasn't going to be a trial."
316,00:18:00,00:18:05,So... almost everything that I collected has never been processed. All right.
317,00:18:05,00:18:07,Have the boxes sent to the garage.
318,00:18:07,00:18:10,Finn and Morgan will set up the tent and work the evidence.
319,00:18:10,00:18:14,You have a close personal relationship with Abby Fisher.
320,00:18:14,00:18:16,I need you to take a backseat.
321,00:18:17,00:18:18,Fair enough.
322,00:18:19,00:18:19,"FINLAY: Hey, Morgan."
323,00:18:19,00:18:20,You all set up?
324,00:18:21,00:18:21,BRODY: Yep.
325,00:18:21,00:18:25,I used Sara's original crime scene photos as a guide.
326,00:18:31,00:18:32,"Ah, those poor kids."
327,00:18:32,00:18:36,Had no idea that their fun camping trip would end like this.
328,00:18:36,00:18:38,Yeah.
329,00:18:38,00:18:41,"I, uh, placed note cards reflecting the DNA results."
330,00:18:41,00:18:44,"""M"" is for Mom, ""H"" is for Hannah, ""A"" is for Abby."
331,00:18:45,00:18:50,"All right. And according to Sara's sketch, the two girls were inside their sleeping bags over here..."
332,00:18:50,00:18:51,"Hannah, Abby..."
333,00:18:51,00:18:53,"and then over here, the mom."
334,00:18:53,00:18:59,"Yeah, the nine-year-old, Hannah, had Mom's blood on her feet, so we know Mom was killed first, right over there."
335,00:18:59,00:19:03,"This, here, is Hannah's blood trail."
336,00:19:03,00:19:06,FINLAY: Hannah's wound was immediately debilitating and fatal.
337,00:19:06,00:19:09,So she would not have been able to walk back to her bed.
338,00:19:11,00:19:13,So somebody carried her and then tucked her in.
339,00:19:16,00:19:20,"Well, the killer thought Abby was dead, too, 'cause he tucked her in."
340,00:19:22,00:19:23,Shows remorse.
341,00:19:23,00:19:26,Or he wanted to make it look like it was the father.
342,00:19:26,00:19:28,Somebody who cared about his kids.
343,00:19:28,00:19:32,"BRODY: Yeah. Either way, looks like the killer had to touch the sleeping bags, so it could be a good source of prints."
344,00:19:32,00:19:34,Just like the tent flap.
345,00:19:34,00:19:37,I'm going to swab every blood drop in here.
346,00:19:37,00:19:42,Maybe we'll get lucky and the killer left some of himself behind.
347,00:20:32,00:20:33,I got prints.
348,00:20:33,00:20:34,Some on the tent flap.
349,00:20:34,00:20:38,Those were unidentified. But I also found one on Hannah's sleeping bag.
350,00:20:38,00:20:39,That one paid off.
351,00:20:39,00:20:40,Garth Fogel.
352,00:20:40,00:20:42,He's a registered sex offender.
353,00:20:42,00:20:44,Convicted of molesting a little girl back in '95.
354,00:20:44,00:20:49,"He was released from prison in 2004, one month before the Fishers were murdered."
355,00:20:49,00:20:55,SIDLE: He has a beard. The man that Abby remembered tucking her into her sleeping bag had a beard.
356,00:20:55,00:20:56,And smelled of gun cleaner.
357,00:20:56,00:21:00,"When Fogel was arrested, police found over 15 guns in his place."
358,00:21:00,00:21:01,ANDREWS: Hey.
359,00:21:01,00:21:03,I analyzed the blood samples Finn collected from the tent.
360,00:21:03,00:21:06,Everything belonged to Mom and the two girls.
361,00:21:06,00:21:08,Except for one that turned out to be animal blood.
362,00:21:08,00:21:12,"""Animal blood""? I'm still testing to figure out what kind of animal it came from."
363,00:21:12,00:21:14,There was no other DNA in the tent?
364,00:21:14,00:21:15,Sorry.
365,00:21:15,00:21:20,"But when I tested Garth Fogel's samples against the DNA samples, I got a big surprise."
366,00:21:20,00:21:25,He was the biological father of the nine-year-old daughter Hannah.
367,00:21:28,00:21:31,"Wait, I-I knew that Barry Fisher wasn't Hannah's birth father."
368,00:21:31,00:21:38,"According to a family friend, Kathy Fisher told everyone that Hannah's father died in a car accident before she was even born."
369,00:21:39,00:21:43,"If I were pregnant with a sex offender's baby, I'd probably lie about it, too."
370,00:21:43,00:21:45,Maybe that lie caught up with her.
371,00:21:45,00:21:47,Got the family killed.
372,00:21:55,00:21:56,Garth Fogel?
373,00:21:59,00:22:01,I'm CSI Nick Stokes.
374,00:22:03,00:22:05,I asked for a coffee 20 minutes ago.
375,00:22:05,00:22:09,"Answer some of my questions, and I'll see what I can do for you."
376,00:22:09,00:22:10,I haven't done anything wrong.
377,00:22:10,00:22:12,You mean recently or ten years ago?
378,00:22:17,00:22:19,Do you recognize this family?
379,00:22:24,00:22:25,I'll take that as a no.
380,00:22:25,00:22:26,Um...
381,00:22:26,00:22:28,how about now?
382,00:22:31,00:22:32,"Oh, these are good."
383,00:22:32,00:22:33,How about these?
384,00:22:36,00:22:40,The Fishers went on a camping trip and someone slaughtered them in their tent.
385,00:22:44,00:22:45,Wasn't me.
386,00:22:45,00:22:48,The girls were five and nine.
387,00:22:48,00:22:50,"They're really cute, really innocent."
388,00:22:50,00:22:52,"That's just the way you like them, isn't it?"
389,00:22:52,00:22:53,"That's sick, you son of a bitch!"
390,00:22:53,00:22:54,She was my daughter!
391,00:22:55,00:22:57,Sit your ass down!
392,00:22:58,00:23:02,I don't think the fact that she was your daughter would even stop a pervert like you.
393,00:23:02,00:23:05,You probably even thought you had a right to her.
394,00:23:06,00:23:08,You were out of prison a month and you got that itch again.
395,00:23:08,00:23:09,Didn't you?
396,00:23:10,00:23:13,I think you followed the Fishers to their campsite.
397,00:23:13,00:23:15,Drugged the dad to get him out of the way.
398,00:23:15,00:23:17,And took his gun.
399,00:23:17,00:23:18,Went into the tent to grab Hannah.
400,00:23:18,00:23:22,But Kathy wasn't gonna let you take her daughter without a fight.
401,00:23:22,00:23:23,(grunts)
402,00:23:24,00:23:26,Mommy! Mommy!
403,00:23:26,00:23:28,What did you do?!
404,00:23:28,00:23:30,You certainly weren't going back to prison.
405,00:23:30,00:23:31,"So, you got rid of the witnesses."
406,00:23:31,00:23:32,I'm sorry.
407,00:23:36,00:23:43,"And there must be some shred of humanity left in you because after you shot both girls, you felt bad about it."
408,00:23:43,00:23:45,Tucked them into their sleeping bags.
409,00:23:45,00:23:49,"Then you finished off the dad, and made it look like a murder/suicide."
410,00:23:49,00:23:51,Sound about right? That's a load of crap.
411,00:23:51,00:23:53,I was nowhere near that family.
412,00:23:53,00:23:57,Then how do you explain your fingerprint on Hannah's sleeping bag?
413,00:24:02,00:24:04,"You'd better start talking to me, man."
414,00:24:07,00:24:08,All right.
415,00:24:08,00:24:10,I saw them at their house.
416,00:24:10,00:24:13,They were packing to go camping.
417,00:24:13,00:24:14,What were you doing there?
418,00:24:14,00:24:15,I wanted to see my daughter.
419,00:24:17,00:24:19,Kathy never told me that she was pregnant.
420,00:24:21,00:24:22,I found out in prison.
421,00:24:23,00:24:26,So I looked them up as soon as I got out.
422,00:24:27,00:24:29,But Kathy wasn't gonna let you anywhere near Hannah.
423,00:24:29,00:24:31,So you followed them to their campsite.
424,00:24:31,00:24:32,No.
425,00:24:32,00:24:34,I went to their house.
426,00:24:34,00:24:41,Kathy was packing the car and I told her that Hannah has every right to know who her real father is.
427,00:24:41,00:24:42,And that is me!
428,00:24:44,00:24:46,Kathy told me to go to hell.
429,00:24:46,00:24:48,"That piss you off? Yes, it pissed me off!"
430,00:24:51,00:24:53,"I lost my temper, all right?"
431,00:24:53,00:24:57,"I grabbed the sleeping bag and I ripped it out of the car, and that is how my fingerprints got on it."
432,00:24:58,00:25:00,"Kathy threatened to call the cops, so I got the hell out of there."
433,00:25:01,00:25:04,I never saw them after that.
434,00:25:06,00:25:07,SANDERS: Nick thinks Fogel's lying.
435,00:25:07,00:25:09,Does he have an alibi?
436,00:25:09,00:25:10,Said he was with his mom.
437,00:25:10,00:25:11,Great. Let's talk to her.
438,00:25:11,00:25:13,She died five years ago.
439,00:25:13,00:25:16,What?! Nick is getting a warrant to pull his old cell and credit card records.
440,00:25:16,00:25:20,See if we can at least place him near Mount Charleston around the time of the murders.
441,00:25:20,00:25:22,Abby picked Fogel out of that mug book.
442,00:25:22,00:25:26,"Thought he looked familiar, she couldn't say for sure whether he's the guy that killed her family or not."
443,00:25:26,00:25:28,There's so much she doesn't remember from the night.
444,00:25:30,00:25:33,There might be a way we can help her recover those memories.
445,00:25:45,00:25:47,(bird squawking in distance)
446,00:25:50,00:25:51,You okay?
447,00:25:52,00:25:53,Yeah.
448,00:25:54,00:25:57,Just weird... being back.
449,00:25:57,00:25:59,"Abby, you do not have to do this."
450,00:25:59,00:26:00,I want to.
451,00:26:02,00:26:05,So... how do we do this?
452,00:26:05,00:26:08,You gonna hypnotize me or something?
453,00:26:08,00:26:09,(laughs) No.
454,00:26:09,00:26:11,We're just hoping that being back here might jog your memory.
455,00:26:11,00:26:14,"You know-- the sights, the smells?"
456,00:26:15,00:26:16,Let your mind drift back.
457,00:26:18,00:26:19,It's worth a shot.
458,00:26:30,00:26:31,You did a great job.
459,00:26:32,00:26:34,It looks exactly like it did ten years ago.
460,00:26:34,00:26:38,SANDERS: Thanks. I even put gun cleaner inside the tent to see if it helps.
461,00:26:39,00:26:40,And I brought this.
462,00:26:40,00:26:42,We might need to document it for court.
463,00:26:42,00:26:43,SIDLE: Good plan.
464,00:26:45,00:26:46,GIRL: Daddy!
465,00:26:51,00:26:52,Hannah...
466,00:26:53,00:26:54,(girls giggling)
467,00:26:56,00:26:56,Mommy!
468,00:26:56,00:26:58,(girls chattering indistinctly)
469,00:27:03,00:27:05,BOTH: Daddy!
470,00:27:18,00:27:19,(girl screams)
471,00:28:06,00:28:07,Mommy!
472,00:28:08,00:28:10,No! No!
473,00:28:10,00:28:11,No!
474,00:28:11,00:28:15,(gasps)
475,00:28:29,00:28:30,(gasps)
476,00:28:42,00:28:44,Mom and Hannah.
477,00:28:45,00:28:46,I saw them.
478,00:28:47,00:28:49,They were dead.
479,00:28:50,00:28:52,I'm so sorry.
480,00:28:55,00:28:56,What else did you remember?
481,00:28:56,00:28:59,"The man, he..."
482,00:28:59,00:29:00,he had a patch.
483,00:29:00,00:29:03,On his jacket. It had antlers.
484,00:29:03,00:29:05,Like a deer?
485,00:29:05,00:29:06,Did you see his face?
486,00:29:08,00:29:10,I couldn't make it out.
487,00:29:12,00:29:14,He just shot them!
488,00:29:14,00:29:15,It's okay.
489,00:29:16,00:29:18,It's all right. You did great.
490,00:29:18,00:29:20,Yeah.
491,00:29:20,00:29:22,It's okay.
492,00:29:27,00:29:30,FINLAY: Henry identified the animal blood we found in the Fishers' tent.
493,00:29:30,00:29:31,It's elk blood.
494,00:29:31,00:29:35,"Oh, maybe that's what Abby saw on the killer's jacket."
495,00:29:35,00:29:38,"I mean, an elk kind of looks like a deer, just with bigger antlers."
496,00:29:38,00:29:43,"Okay, so we have a killer who smells like gun cleaner and has traces of elk blood on him."
497,00:29:44,00:29:45,He's a hunter.
498,00:29:45,00:29:47,"And if he was wearing a jacket with a patch on it, maybe he belongs to a hunting club."
499,00:29:47,00:29:49,There are a lot of them in Nevada.
500,00:29:50,00:29:51,Any close to Mount Charleston?
501,00:29:51,00:29:52,Let's see.
502,00:29:55,00:29:57,This club's logo is a duck.
503,00:30:01,00:30:02,That one.
504,00:30:03,00:30:04,That looks like an elk to me.
505,00:30:04,00:30:10,"""Legend Creek Hunting Club."" (door closes)"
506,00:30:11,00:30:12,Dead animals.
507,00:30:12,00:30:16,"Awesome. God, it looks like they're just staring us right in the eye."
508,00:30:16,00:30:18,So lifelike. Thank you.
509,00:30:18,00:30:19,Stuffed them myself.
510,00:30:19,00:30:20,Right back there.
511,00:30:20,00:30:24,That 12-point buck? Three shots to take him down.
512,00:30:24,00:30:26,He wanted to live.
513,00:30:26,00:30:27,He's a beauty.
514,00:30:27,00:30:28,Randy Pruitt.
515,00:30:28,00:30:30,Club president.
516,00:30:30,00:30:31,What can I do for you ladies?
517,00:30:31,00:30:33,"This is Sarah Sidle, I'm Morgan Brody."
518,00:30:33,00:30:35,We are with the Las Vegas crime lab.
519,00:30:35,00:30:39,Crime lab? We need to take a look at your membership records from 2004.
520,00:30:39,00:30:42,Specifically the members who had tags to hunt elk.
521,00:30:42,00:30:44,(laughs) Elk pressing charges these days?
522,00:30:44,00:30:48,We're investigating the murder of a family shot to death on Mount Charleston.
523,00:30:49,00:30:52,"We hunt animals, not human beings. Yeah?"
524,00:30:52,00:30:54,"Well, some people can't tell the difference."
525,00:30:55,00:30:56,These people...
526,00:30:56,00:30:58,are my friends. I'm sorry.
527,00:30:58,00:31:00,We're still gonna have to take a look those records.
528,00:31:00,00:31:02,"Well, our members have a right to privacy."
529,00:31:03,00:31:04,Yeah.
530,00:31:04,00:31:06,Not anymore.
531,00:31:20,00:31:21,2004.
532,00:31:22,00:31:23,Thank you.
533,00:31:26,00:31:31,"Let's pull all the members that have beards and tags to hunt elk, and show the pictures to Abby."
534,00:31:31,00:31:33,Let's hope she can identify our killer.
535,00:31:44,00:31:45,"Take your time, okay?"
536,00:32:02,00:32:03,That's him.
537,00:32:03,00:32:04,Are you sure?
538,00:32:05,00:32:06,Positive.
539,00:32:09,00:32:10,"Yeah, we got an I.D."
540,00:32:10,00:32:12,Donald Wraith.
541,00:32:12,00:32:13,Lives in Henderson.
542,00:32:18,00:32:20,Donald Wraith!
543,00:32:20,00:32:22,LVPD! Turn off the engine!
544,00:32:22,00:32:23,Out of the truck!
545,00:32:24,00:32:25,Get out!
546,00:32:27,00:32:28,Said get out!
547,00:32:36,00:32:38,Looks like the hunter became the hunted.
548,00:32:46,00:32:47,"STOKES: Hey, Super Dave."
549,00:32:47,00:32:50,"Sorry to drag you all the way out here, man."
550,00:32:50,00:32:52,You kidding me?
551,00:32:52,00:32:53,"Trees, good clean air."
552,00:32:53,00:32:55,It's nice to be out in nature.
553,00:32:59,00:33:01,STOKES: Nine millimeter casing.
554,00:33:01,00:33:03,The ammo's consistent with the victim's gun.
555,00:33:03,00:33:07,Powder burns indicate he was shot at close range.
556,00:33:08,00:33:12,"Yeah, but he couldn't have shot himself-- the gun would have fallen out of his hand."
557,00:33:15,00:33:17,Killer tried to make it look like a suicide.
558,00:33:22,00:33:26,Abby Fisher I.D.'s Donald Wraith as the man who shot her family.
559,00:33:26,00:33:29,We come out here to pick him up and find him murdered?
560,00:33:29,00:33:31,Maybe to keep him quiet?
561,00:33:31,00:33:32,Maybe.
562,00:33:32,00:33:36,Sounds to me like someone else was involved in this massacre ten years ago.
563,00:33:37,00:33:40,I thought Abby Fisher only remembers one man in the tent that night.
564,00:33:40,00:33:42,Doesn't mean that somebody else wasn't there.
565,00:33:42,00:33:43,Garth Fogel.
566,00:33:43,00:33:45,The pedophile?
567,00:33:45,00:33:46,"Yeah, we haven't cleared him as a suspect."
568,00:33:46,00:33:51,And so far I haven't been able to find a connection between Donald Wraith and the Fisher family.
569,00:33:51,00:33:54,"So, you're thinking Wraith's connection is with Fogel."
570,00:33:54,00:33:56,Maybe they were friends.
571,00:33:56,00:33:58,Fogel wanted his daughter.
572,00:33:58,00:34:00,The Fishers weren't gonna give her back without a fight.
573,00:34:00,00:34:01,Maybe he brings Wraith for backup.
574,00:34:03,00:34:04,Go prove it.
575,00:34:09,00:34:10,Hey. Hey.
576,00:34:10,00:34:12,Nick said he found trace on Donald Wraith's gun.
577,00:34:12,00:34:13,Were you able to identify it?
578,00:34:13,00:34:15,"Yeah, it was a type of resin."
579,00:34:15,00:34:22,"Traditionally, a hydrocarbon secretion from plants, resins were a prized possession in the ancient world."
580,00:34:22,00:34:24,I'm sure you're familiar with frankincense and myrrh.
581,00:34:24,00:34:25,Gifts for baby Jesus.
582,00:34:25,00:34:26,You're a wise woman.
583,00:34:26,00:34:34,"But in this day and age, humans have been able to create synthetic resins that are much stronger and more versatile than their natural predecessors."
584,00:34:34,00:34:43,"As in this case, we have a unique blend of methyl methacrylate, thixotropic and a polymerization catalyst."
585,00:34:43,00:34:45,Aren't synthetic resins used a lot in construction?
586,00:34:45,00:34:49,"Yes, but... 'Cause Garth Fogel works as a laborer for a construction company."
587,00:34:49,00:34:50,"If we can prove he had access, then we..."
588,00:34:52,00:34:54,You didn't let me finish. Sorry.
589,00:34:54,00:34:58,The chemical structure of this particular resin is only used in one industry.
590,00:34:59,00:35:00,Taxidermy.
591,00:35:01,00:35:02,Taxidermy.
592,00:35:02,00:35:05,Does Garth Fogel have a penchant for stuffing woodland creatures?
593,00:35:05,00:35:06,No.
594,00:35:06,00:35:08,But I know someone who does.
595,00:35:08,00:35:09,Thank you.
596,00:35:12,00:35:13,"You lied to me, Randy."
597,00:35:13,00:35:15,You said you didn't hunt people.
598,00:35:15,00:35:17,But you murdered Donald Wraith.
599,00:35:17,00:35:20,And you murdered the Fisher family.
600,00:35:20,00:35:22,"No. No, I didn't."
601,00:35:22,00:35:26,We found a clear cast resin on Donald Wraith's gun.
602,00:35:26,00:35:30,It's the same resin that you purchased two weeks ago for your taxidermy.
603,00:35:31,00:35:33,I-Is that all you've got?
604,00:35:33,00:35:34,"No, I have motive."
605,00:35:35,00:35:39,You and Donald Wraith killed the Fishers ten years ago.
606,00:35:39,00:35:44,"Donald was about to be arrested, so you killed him so he wouldn't implicate you."
607,00:35:44,00:35:47,But you had already implicated yourself.
608,00:35:48,00:35:52,We pulled your fingerprints off the file that you gave us at the hunting club.
609,00:35:52,00:35:56,And it was a match to prints from inside the tent that the family was slaughtered in.
610,00:35:58,00:35:59,"What happened, Randy?!"
611,00:35:59,00:36:02,Did you get tired of hunting elk?
612,00:36:02,00:36:04,Did you want your prey to beg for mercy?
613,00:36:05,00:36:07,It wasn't like that.
614,00:36:10,00:36:12,We never planned on killing anyone.
615,00:36:12,00:36:14,What was your plan?
616,00:36:15,00:36:18,Donald wanted to have some fun with the wife.
617,00:36:18,00:36:22,"Her and the husband came by the shop, asked directions."
618,00:36:22,00:36:26,Sorry to bother you guys-- it feels like we've been driving in circles for hours.
619,00:36:26,00:36:27,I'm a terrible navigator.
620,00:36:27,00:36:30,We wanted to set up camp near Deer Stream trail head.
621,00:36:30,00:36:32,"Can't seem to find it. Well, that's..."
622,00:36:33,00:36:34,...easy to miss.
623,00:36:35,00:36:37,What you do is you hit Timber Canyon.
624,00:36:37,00:36:39,"There's a fork, stay to the right, it'll take you all the way in."
625,00:36:40,00:36:41,Thank you so much.
626,00:36:41,00:36:42,"My pleasure, ma'am."
627,00:36:48,00:36:50,You followed them back to the campsite?
628,00:36:51,00:36:52,You had to get the husband out of the way.
629,00:36:52,00:36:55,"How did you drug him, exactly?"
630,00:36:56,00:36:57,Saw him sitting alone at the fire.
631,00:36:57,00:37:00,Pretended we were camping nearby.
632,00:37:02,00:37:04,Brought over some booze.
633,00:37:04,00:37:06,"When he wasn't looking, we slipped him a Mickey."
634,00:37:06,00:37:12,"You know, most people don't just walk around, carrying chloral hydrate on them, unless they've done this kind of thing before."
635,00:37:13,00:37:16,What happened after Fisher passed out?
636,00:37:17,00:37:20,I stood guard while Donald went in the tent.
637,00:37:20,00:37:21,With Barry Fisher's gun.
638,00:37:21,00:37:23,"He was only gonna threaten her, keep her quiet."
639,00:37:23,00:37:25,But she fought back.
640,00:37:26,00:37:28,I heard a shot.
641,00:37:29,00:37:30,Then two more.
642,00:37:35,00:37:36,What did you do?
643,00:37:37,00:37:40,We didn't know they had children.
644,00:37:43,00:37:46,"Donald said the girls saw his face, so he had to kill them."
645,00:37:49,00:37:57,"I took them back into their sleeping bags, while he went out to take care of the husband."
646,00:38:00,00:38:03,"There is a problem with your story, Randy."
647,00:38:04,00:38:06,The youngest daughter survived.
648,00:38:07,00:38:12,And she identified Donald Wraith as the person that put her back into the sleeping bag.
649,00:38:13,00:38:14,Not you.
650,00:38:14,00:38:15,He's the one that felt bad.
651,00:38:15,00:38:17,And I am willing to bet...
652,00:38:19,00:38:21,that you are the one that pulled the trigger that night.
653,00:38:25,00:38:27,"Either way, your hunting days are over."
654,00:38:43,00:38:46,So... they didn't even know us?
655,00:38:47,00:38:48,They were just bad people.
656,00:38:48,00:38:52,And you and your family were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
657,00:38:54,00:38:55,That's messed up.
658,00:38:56,00:38:57,Your father was innocent.
659,00:39:00,00:39:02,"All these years, I blamed him."
660,00:39:05,00:39:06,Hated him.
661,00:39:07,00:39:10,Thought he killed Mom and Hannah.
662,00:39:11,00:39:13,Tried to kill me.
663,00:39:14,00:39:16,You can let that all go now.
664,00:39:18,00:39:19,Your dad was a good man.
665,00:39:19,00:39:22,And he loved you very much.
666,00:39:29,00:39:32,"Hey, ready to go home?"
667,00:39:34,00:39:35,Yeah.
668,00:39:40,00:39:41,Thank you.
669,00:39:42,00:39:44,Any time.
670,00:39:49,00:39:52,"Oh, One D's playing at the Hard Rock Saturday night. You in?"
671,00:39:52,00:39:53,One Direction?
672,00:39:53,00:39:55,Seriously?
673,00:39:55,00:39:56,"No, I'm just kidding."
674,00:39:56,00:39:57,"It's Lorde, I'll pick you up at 7:00."
675,00:39:59,00:40:00,Cool.
676,00:40:14,00:40:16,SANDERS: You look like your dad.
677,00:40:18,00:40:20,He used to read to me when I was a kid.
678,00:40:20,00:40:23,Charlotte's Web was my favorite.
679,00:40:24,00:40:25,Must've read it a hundred times.
680,00:40:25,00:40:26,That's a nice memory.
681,00:40:26,00:40:28,I have a lot of nice memories of him.
682,00:40:30,00:40:31,"My mom, too."
683,00:40:32,00:40:35,"They were toxic when they were together, though."
684,00:40:37,00:40:39,Your mom said your dad was abusive?
685,00:40:40,00:40:41,She killed him in self-defense?
686,00:40:42,00:40:44,That's what she said.
687,00:40:46,00:40:47,You don't believe her?
688,00:40:49,00:40:58,"Look, I know my dad wasn't a saint, but my mom was an alcoholic who suffered from mental illness."
689,00:41:00,00:41:05,I'm just not sure that things were as black and white as she made them out to be.
690,00:41:07,00:41:09,"Well, you did say they had a volatile relationship."
691,00:41:10,00:41:12,Fact is...
692,00:41:12,00:41:14,I'll never know what happened that night.
693,00:41:17,00:41:23,"This is gonna sound horrible, but I'm kind of jealous of Abby."
694,00:41:26,00:41:28,She gets to rewrite her whole family history.
695,00:41:31,00:41:33,Nothing will ever change what my mother did.
696,00:41:37,00:41:45,"Well, you can't change the past, but you always have the future."
697,00:41:46,00:41:48,Your mom's still alive.
698,00:41:48,00:41:51,Not too late for you to start over.
699,00:41:56,00:41:58,I don't know if I could.
