0	00:01:28	00:01:30	Hey! Where's my money?
1	00:01:30	00:01:31	You wait here!
2	00:01:48	00:01:50	You want to come with us?
3	00:01:50	00:01:52	Oh, my God.
4	00:01:52	00:01:53	Come on.
5	00:02:30	00:02:32	Gunshot wound to the neck.
6	00:02:32	00:02:34	No visible GSR.
7	00:02:38	00:02:40	Money on the visor.
8	00:02:40	00:02:41	It wasn't a robbery.
9	00:02:41	00:02:45	Dirt clods on the floor mat look undisturbed.
10	00:02:45	00:02:47	Could be from the last fare.
11	00:02:47	00:02:49	I don't see any shell casings, though.
12	00:02:50	00:02:52	Partition's closed.
13	00:02:52	00:02:54	Bullet-proof glass.
14	00:02:54	00:02:55	He was not shot from inside.
15	00:03:08	00:03:12	Well, I got two bullet holes in the passenger door.
16	00:03:12	00:03:14	That's a weird side of the car for a driveby.
17	00:03:14	00:03:15	Maybe he wasn't shot here.
18	00:03:15	00:03:17	Maybe he just ended up here.
19	00:03:22	00:03:23	Excuse me?
20	00:03:23	00:03:25	Are you with the Transit Board?
21	00:03:25	00:03:26	Yeah.
22	00:03:26	00:03:28	Do you have the dispatch log?
23	00:03:36	00:03:38	Thanks.
24	00:03:44	00:03:45	Why's he leaving?
25	00:03:47	00:03:49	Well, that's kind of what he does.
26	00:03:51	00:03:52	Is this camera always on?
27	00:03:52	00:03:54	Only on HBO.
28	00:03:54	00:03:58	It takes stills for ten seconds when the door opens, and then for the first ten seconds of the fare.
29	00:03:58	00:03:59	We're gonna need the pictures.
30	00:04:04	00:04:06	This is Catherine.
31	00:04:06	00:04:07	It's Gil.
32	00:04:07	00:04:08	How you doing?
33	00:04:08	00:04:10	I'm busy.
34	00:04:10	00:04:11	Checking up on me?
35	00:04:12	00:04:13	Why would I need to do that?
36	00:04:13	00:04:14	You tell me.
37	00:04:14	00:04:24	Look, I know you tend to get a little territorial about your crime scenes, and I don't want there to be any tension between us, so I'm giving you fair warning.
38	00:04:24	00:04:26	Fair warning for what?
39	00:04:27	00:04:30	Hi.
40	00:04:35	00:04:37	Julian Harper.
41	00:04:37	00:04:41	If it weren't for the cyanosis, I'd say he was doing a photo shoot for GQ.
42	00:04:45	00:04:47	Yeah, I'm sure he wasn't ready for this photo shoot.
43	00:04:47	00:04:49	Body temp's 95.
44	00:04:52	00:04:55	00 a.m.
45	00:05:01	00:05:04	Well, there's plenty of drugs around here.
46	00:05:04	00:05:06	You think he OD'd?
47	00:05:08	00:05:09	Yeah, no edema.
48	00:05:12	00:05:13	Some petechia.
49	00:05:13	00:05:16	Could be suffocation or strangulation.
50	00:05:16	00:05:19	But no ligature marks or bruising.
51	00:05:19	00:05:20	However...
52	00:05:22	00:05:24	...some fibers under the chin.
53	00:05:37	00:05:39	What are you doing?
54	00:05:39	00:05:40	It's for my scrapbook.
55	00:05:40	00:05:45	I've got a perfect spot for him-- a place of honor between Tupac and Entwhistle.
56	00:05:47	00:05:51	The taxi's last dropoff was this address.
57	00:05:51	00:05:53	This guy's got dirt on his shoes and pants.
58	00:05:53	00:05:55	There was dirt in the cab.
59	00:05:55	00:05:56	He's got to be the last fare.
60	00:05:57	00:05:59	So, somebody killed them both.
61	00:05:59	00:06:04	And if it's about money, doesn't look like this guy has much.
62	00:06:04	00:06:06	Well, I guess it's relative.
63	00:06:07	00:06:14	It depends on who you are.
64	00:06:45	00:06:48	Samay... Samay Thao.
65	00:06:48	00:06:51	15527 East Charleston Road.
66	00:06:51	00:06:53	That's a long way from here.
67	00:06:54	00:06:58	I count six shots in his chest.
68	00:06:58	00:07:01	There were two in the cab, one in the cabbie.
69	00:07:01	00:07:04	If the math is correct, that's nine.
70	00:07:05	00:07:08	Suggests semi-automatic, but I don't see any shell casings here.
71	00:07:08	00:07:10	Yeah, there were none in the taxi, either.
72	00:07:10	00:07:12	Killer could have picked them up.
73	00:07:12	00:07:18	To shoot a guy six times in the torso, you either have to be very close, or a hell of a shot.
74	00:07:18	00:07:20	It's okay if I roll him? Yeah.
75	00:07:25	00:07:27	Well, no through and throughs.
76	00:07:27	00:07:30	We should be able to recover some bullets from the body.
77	00:07:31	00:07:32	Hang on.
78	00:07:33	00:07:35	What do you make of that?
79	00:07:35	00:07:38	Looks like he rubbed up against something.
80	00:07:43	00:07:46	There's some paint flaked off of that railing.
81	00:08:15	00:08:16	We got blood drops.
82	00:08:30	00:08:30	Gil.
83	00:08:32	00:08:34	This looks fresh.
84	00:08:44	00:08:47	Hey, Brass?
85	00:08:50	00:08:51	Las Vegas Police! Put the gun down!
86	00:08:51	00:08:52	( shouting in Laotian ) Put the gun down!
87	00:08:52	00:08:54	Put it down.
88	00:08:59	00:09:03	I shoot... burglar!
89	00:09:08	00:09:10	Julian Harper.
90	00:09:10	00:09:11	Wasn't he supposed to be like, uh...
91	00:09:11	00:09:13	the next Brad Pitt or something?
92	00:09:13	00:09:15	Yeah. Now he's the next River Phoenix.
93	00:09:20	00:09:21	All right, Gerald.
94	00:09:21	00:09:23	Uh, they call me Blinky.
95	00:09:23	00:09:25	And what was your relation to Julian Harper?
96	00:09:25	00:09:27	Best friends since kindergarten.
97	00:09:27	00:09:28	Now I work for him.
98	00:09:28	00:09:30	What did you do for him?
99	00:09:30	00:09:31	Pretty much everything.
100	00:09:31	00:09:33	You know, bought his stuff, hooked him up.
101	00:09:33	00:09:34	Drove him to meetings.
102	00:09:34	00:09:36	Did you find the body?
103	00:09:36	00:09:37	I ordered room service.
104	00:09:37	00:09:39	I wanted to see if he was hungry.
105	00:09:39	00:09:42	Boom, there he was.
106	00:09:42	00:09:45	Did you touch or move the body in any way?
107	00:09:45	00:09:46	Uh, no way. No.
108	00:09:46	00:09:47	I watch those murder shows, you know?
109	00:09:48	00:09:51	I know to just keep my hands to myself, and, uh, call the cops.
110	00:09:51	00:09:52	What is with the robe?
111	00:09:55	00:09:56	Did you pat him down?
112	00:09:56	00:09:58	He's packing a small, friendly weapon.
113	00:09:58	00:10:00	Would you mind standing up for us, sir?
114	00:10:00	00:10:02	Nah, bro, I-I-I...
115	00:10:02	00:10:05	kind of got the angle of the dangle going.
116	00:10:05	00:10:07	The boing, boing, boing.
117	00:10:07	00:10:08	Stand up.
118	00:10:14	00:10:19	I, uh, took a Prevalis on the plane over.
119	00:10:19	00:10:21	I been pitching a tent for, like, eight hours.
120	00:10:21	00:10:23	Yeah, I-I think I need to consult a physician.
121	00:10:23	00:10:25	It's called a priapism.
122	00:10:25	00:10:26	Just in case you were wondering.
123	00:10:26	00:10:28	What else are you on, man?
124	00:10:29	00:10:30	Oh, uh, nothing.
125	00:10:30	00:10:32	I mean, uh, I smoked a little herb at the club, but that's it.
126	00:10:32	00:10:33	What about Julian?
127	00:10:33	00:10:36	Oh, Jules? Oh, no, he, uh... he won't even take aspirin.
128	00:10:36	00:10:37	You know, he's organic.
129	00:10:37	00:10:39	You know, treats his body like a temple.
130	00:10:39	00:10:42	Well, we're gonna need a list of everyone who was here worshipping the temple.
131	00:10:42	00:10:44	Can I sit down?
132	00:10:44	00:10:45	Yeah.
133	00:10:46	00:10:49	Did someone turn a shower on or something?
134	00:10:49	00:10:50	You cleared that room, right?
135	00:11:03	00:11:06	Hey!
136	00:11:07	00:11:09	Are you okay?
137	00:11:10	00:11:11	Hey.
138	00:11:13	00:11:15	We need a medic!
139	00:11:16	00:11:18	And a bag for stomach contents.
140	00:11:25	00:11:27	His name is Keo Vipraxay.
141	00:11:27	00:11:28	He barely speaks English.
142	00:11:28	00:11:30	He's South Asian, I think.
143	00:11:30	00:11:31	Anyway, it's all clear.
144	00:11:31	00:11:33	Thanks, Jim.
145	00:11:46	00:11:48	Double-aught buck.
146	00:11:48	00:11:50	Standard shot is nine pellets.
147	00:11:50	00:11:52	That would account for all the hits.
148	00:11:54	00:12:02	So you're saying that a single shotgun blast, through a security door, took out two separate victims in two separate locations?
149	00:12:02	00:12:04	Weird, huh?
150	00:12:04	00:12:07	The cab drops Samay Thao in front of this building.
151	00:12:07	00:12:13	And the position of the blood drops give us a pretty good idea of where Samay was standing when he was shot.
152	00:12:13	00:12:16	He was a little shorter than me.
153	00:12:16	00:12:19	Shots were centered on his chest, about there.
154	00:12:21	00:12:28	My guess is, the cab was parked down there the driver peeled out when he got shot.
155	00:12:33	00:12:37	Vertical deflection down to the cab is roughly 60 degrees.
156	00:12:37	00:12:41	Standard shot won't spread that far.
157	00:12:41	00:12:43	The pellets must have come through the screen.
158	00:12:50	00:12:51	The old billiard ball effect.
159	00:12:52	00:12:56	The cab driver was collateral damage.
160	00:12:56	00:12:59	Okay, but the man with the shotgun said he shot a burglar.
161	00:13:00	00:13:02	What's here to steal?
162	00:13:05	00:13:11	Semen on the bed sheets, as well as every other flat surface in here.
163	00:13:11	00:13:13	Yeah.
164	00:13:13	00:13:17	I've got vodka, champagne, cocaine...
165	00:13:17	00:13:19	Hey, hey.
166	00:13:19	00:13:21	Pantyhose.
167	00:13:35	00:13:38	I've got some smudges over here.
168	00:13:45	00:13:47	I've got some footprints.
169	00:13:47	00:13:52	Looks like someone was standing right there.
170	00:13:52	00:13:54	Was this guy just doing it all over the hotel room?
171	00:13:57	00:13:59	If those are his footprints...
172	00:13:59	00:14:01	where are hers?
173	00:14:01	00:14:04	Or her feet were up... in the air.
174	00:14:04	00:14:07	You tell me-- you just had your honeymoon.
175	00:14:07	00:14:11	You want to swab this?
176	00:14:15	00:14:17	I just don't understand.
177	00:14:17	00:14:20	I mean, who would want to kill Julian?
178	00:14:20	00:14:27	I mean, he'd had some weird fan mail, but I don't think any of those kind of people would be able to get in his suite. Were you in his suite?
179	00:14:27	00:14:32	The ex-wife isn't exactly the best person to have around when you're looking to get laid.
180	00:14:32	00:14:34	Was that your choice or his?
181	00:14:34	00:14:36	It was mutual.
182	00:14:36	00:14:39	I'm strictly his manager now.
183	00:14:39	00:14:41	So if you weren't in his suite, where did you go?
184	00:14:41	00:14:43	I was taking care of business.
185	00:14:43	00:14:55	Checked the boys in, made sure the suite was copasetic, had a drink at Skin, and played pai gow until hotel security came to get me.
186	00:14:55	00:14:57	So how did you get to be his manager?
187	00:14:57	00:15:00	When I was with him, he was broke.
188	00:15:00	00:15:07	Then after the divorce, I still... did his laundry, paid his bills, read his scripts.
189	00:15:07	00:15:10	After a while, I wanted to get paid.
190	00:15:10	00:15:13	Now I get ten percent of everything.
191	00:15:14	00:15:15	Look...
192	00:15:15	00:15:18	I need to make some calls.
193	00:15:18	00:15:19	Julian's parents, the studio...
194	00:15:20	00:15:21	Can we talk about this later?
195	00:15:22	00:15:25	Sure. But I need your prints and your DNA now.
196	00:15:27	00:15:30	Tox shows low levels of cocaine, alcohol and Prevalis.
197	00:15:30	00:15:31	Rules out overdose.
198	00:15:31	00:15:36	Really? I guess he was just acting about the clean-living part.
199	00:15:36	00:15:37	C.O.D.?
200	00:15:37	00:15:39	Asphyxia. Asphyxiated how?
201	00:15:39	00:15:40	I don't know.
202	00:15:40	00:15:41	No broken hyoid.
203	00:15:41	00:15:46	That and the absence of ligature marks or bruises makes strangulation unlikely.
204	00:15:46	00:15:48	Did you find any fibers in his nose or mouth?
205	00:15:48	00:15:49	Nope.
206	00:15:49	00:15:51	That doesn't rule out suffocation.
207	00:15:51	00:15:53	Killer could have used something that didn't shed fibers.
208	00:15:53	00:15:57	Or maybe they came from whoever he was rolling around with in bed.
209	00:15:57	00:16:06	Found, uh, lubricant on his genitals, probably from a condom, and minor abrasions on his penis, indicative of vigorous, prolonged activity.
210	00:16:06	00:16:10	the American dream.
211	00:16:10	00:16:11	Mm-hmm.
212	00:16:22	00:16:26	Your stomach contents contain alcohol and traces of triazolam.
213	00:16:26	00:16:27	Try-as-a-what?
214	00:16:27	00:16:32	It's a sleeping pill, has you reading the inside of your eyelids for a week. I didn't take any pills.
215	00:16:32	00:16:33	We also found cocaine in your bloodstream.
216	00:16:33	00:16:35	I guess you didn't take that, either?
217	00:16:38	00:16:42	So I did a couple of lines, but I didn't take any pills.
218	00:16:42	00:16:45	If I was gonna take a pill, I would've popped E or a perc.
219	00:16:45	00:16:48	Miss Villa, we found you in Julian Harper's suite.
220	00:16:48	00:16:49	Were you ever in his bedroom?
221	00:16:50	00:16:52	Who knows?
222	00:16:52	00:16:55	I don't even know how I ended up in Blinky's room.
223	00:16:56	00:16:57	Oh, my...
224	00:16:57	00:17:01	I swear, if that guy slipped me something...
225	00:17:01	00:17:03	Tell us what you do remember.
226	00:17:05	00:17:06	Um...
227	00:17:08	00:17:11	Me and my girls were at Skin, and, uh...
228	00:17:11	00:17:15	Blinky came over and said he was partying with Julian Harper.
229	00:17:15	00:17:19	And he said they had this pimpy booth, so we went over.
230	00:17:26	00:17:29	It didn't turn out the way I hoped.
231	00:17:31	00:17:34	And the next thing I know, Blinky's on top of me.
232	00:17:34	00:17:36	We could assist you in reporting a date rape.
233	00:17:39	00:17:41	Thanks, but no.
234	00:17:41	00:17:43	It's not an offer, it's our job.
235	00:17:43	00:17:46	There's this Stuffmagazine party at Ghost Bar tonight.
236	00:17:46	00:17:51	I'm not gonna make it harder for me to get in because I tattled on Julian Harper's best friend.
237	00:17:51	00:17:54	I mean, if I run into them tonight...
238	00:17:54	00:17:55	Julian Harper will not be there.
239	00:17:56	00:17:57	Trust me, he will.
240	00:17:57	00:18:01	The coroner finished the autopsy early this morning.
241	00:18:03	00:18:04	He's dead?
242	00:18:04	00:18:07	Yeah.
243	00:18:08	00:18:12	I was in Julian Harper's suite when he died?
244	00:18:13	00:18:15	You're kidding me, right?
245	00:18:15	00:18:18	And being in his suite makes you a suspect.
246	00:18:19	00:18:21	I am? Yes.
247	00:18:21	00:18:25	So we're going to need to take a sample of your DNA.
248	00:18:26	00:18:28	Oh, man.
249	00:18:30	00:18:34	I am so getting into that party tonight for sure.
250	00:18:37	00:18:39	Yeah, I remember that guy.
251	00:18:39	00:18:41	He's, like, Chinese or something, real spun out.
252	00:18:41	00:18:43	He was on meth?
253	00:18:43	00:18:44	Well, he was on something.
254	00:18:44	00:18:46	He was acting all shady.
255	00:18:46	00:18:49	Downed a bottle of soda before he even paid for it.
256	00:18:49	00:18:51	And that's how you knew he was on something?
257	00:18:52	00:18:53	There ain't nothin' out here.
258	00:18:53	00:18:56	People here act messed up because they are messed up.
259	00:18:56	00:19:01	The Metro Transit Board said that he caught a Sunstar Taxi from this address.
260	00:19:01	00:19:02	I called it for him.
261	00:19:02	00:19:04	Anything to get that tweaker out of here.
262	00:19:04	00:19:06	Any idea how he got here in the first place?
263	00:19:06	00:19:09	All I saw him do was walk through the door.
264	00:19:09	00:19:11	Samay Thao.
265	00:19:11	00:19:14	I don't even need to open him up to guess C.O.D.
266	00:19:16	00:19:18	Ocular inflammation.
267	00:19:21	00:19:23	Laceration of the sclera.
268	00:19:24	00:19:29	Hurts like hell when you get a grain of sand in your eye.
269	00:19:31	00:19:35	Imagine this.
270	00:19:43	00:19:44	Bad night for Laotians.
271	00:19:44	00:19:46	What other Laotians are having a bad night?
272	00:19:49	00:19:52	Solo traffic collision on Mount Charleston.
273	00:19:52	00:19:53	Came in early this morning.
274	00:19:53	00:19:54	Noy Vipraxay.
275	00:19:56	00:19:58	Vipraxay?
276	00:19:58	00:20:00	Well, that's a hell of a coincidence.
277	00:20:00	00:20:02	Does it mean something to you?
278	00:20:02	00:20:11	Yeah, he's got the same last name as the guy who shot him. In fact, Grissom said that our vic over there caught a cab at a gas station near Mount Charleston.
279	00:20:11	00:20:13	I'll have auto detail bring in his car.
280	00:20:14	00:20:16	Sounds like your double's becoming a triple.
281	00:20:16	00:20:18	Unless you got any more in your drawers?
282	00:20:18	00:20:19	Hey, Archie.
283	00:20:19	00:20:21	See if you can help me out.
284	00:20:22	00:20:24	There was a smear on the window at the hotel.
285	00:20:24	00:20:25	It came back saliva.
286	00:20:25	00:20:31	So I ran it through CODIS, got a hit, felony battery on this guy, Willie Angel.
287	00:20:31	00:20:36	Now, he's a Las Vegas resident, but he wasn't a registered guest at the hotel.
288	00:20:36	00:20:40	He has no affiliation with Julian's little entourage whatsoever.
289	00:20:40	00:20:43	I think I scoped this guy earlier.
290	00:20:43	00:20:44	Really? Yeah.
291	00:20:44	00:20:46	Do it up.
292	00:20:49	00:20:51	Yeah, there he is.
293	00:20:51	00:20:52	Mm-hmm.
294	00:20:52	00:20:54	Looking dapper.
295	00:20:54	00:20:56	All right.
296	00:20:56	00:20:58	31 a.m.
297	00:20:59	00:21:01	Gets off on the high-roller floor.
298	00:21:09	00:21:11	45 a.m.
299	00:21:11	00:21:14	Shopping bags?
300	00:21:14	00:21:16	There's no mall on that floor.
301	00:21:16	00:21:19	He was shopping at Julian Harper's.
302	00:21:19	00:21:20	Enough time to shop and kill.
303	00:21:22	00:21:27	The Palms issued two card keys-- one to Julian, and one to his boy Blinky.
304	00:21:27	00:21:30	But the database shows...
305	00:21:30	00:21:34	one, two... three keys were used to access the suite?
306	00:21:34	00:21:36	Well, assuming the third card was Willie's.
307	00:21:36	00:21:42	You can't just walk up to the front desk and pull the I lost my key scam on a VIP suite.
308	00:21:42	00:21:44	So...
309	00:21:45	00:21:47	how'd Willie get it?
310	00:21:50	00:21:51	Hi.
311	00:21:52	00:21:53	Sorry.
312	00:21:53	00:21:56	I just started seeing someone. Had a bit of a late night.
313	00:21:57	00:21:59	Let me ask you something.
314	00:21:59	00:22:03	How do you know when it's gone from just friends to more than?
315	00:22:03	00:22:07	Well, if you have to ask...
316	00:22:07	00:22:08	it's just friends.
317	00:22:08	00:22:10	She is making dinner for me this weekend.
318	00:22:11	00:22:11	Are you the only guest?
319	00:22:11	00:22:14	Do her roommates count?
320	00:22:17	00:22:22	The splinter from your vic's eye has four distinct layers.
321	00:22:22	00:22:25	Polycarbonate plastic, aluminum, acrylic and dye.
322	00:22:25	00:22:27	Being an audiophile, I prefer the sound of vinyl.
323	00:22:27	00:22:30	It's from a compact disc?
324	00:22:31	00:22:35	Well, how did it end up in Samay Thao's eye?
325	00:22:38	00:22:40	Noy Vipraxay's car.
326	00:22:40	00:22:42	Easy for you to say.
327	00:22:42	00:22:44	Find anything?
328	00:22:44	00:22:46	Take a look at this.
329	00:22:46	00:22:50	Gravitational pooling directly under the steering wheel.
330	00:22:55	00:22:59	The car was found at the bottom of a steep incline.
331	00:22:59	00:23:01	So he was leaning over it when he bled out.
332	00:23:01	00:23:03	Except he wasn't.
333	00:23:03	00:23:06	Take a look. These were taken at the crash site.
334	00:23:06	00:23:12	If he'd have bled out in the position he was found, there'd be blood on the door, not under the steering wheel.
335	00:23:15	00:23:17	So someone moved the body?
336	00:23:17	00:23:23	There was plenty of mud at the scene, and Samay had mud on his pants.
337	00:23:23	00:23:27	Maybe we can match soil samples.
338	00:23:27	00:23:28	Hang on.
339	00:23:31	00:23:35	Trace came back on the splinter that was in Samay's eye.
340	00:23:35	00:23:37	It was a CD fragment.
341	00:23:41	00:23:42	Samay was in this car.
342	00:23:42	00:23:44	Hey, guys.
343	00:23:44	00:23:48	I got work card hits off prints from the two dead Laotians and the shooter.
344	00:23:48	00:23:49	We already know their IDs.
345	00:23:49	00:23:51	Well, did you already know that they all worked together?
346	00:23:57	00:23:59	So Samay Thao worked for you?
347	00:23:59	00:24:01	Yeah, runs the dryers.
348	00:24:01	00:24:02	When was the last time you saw him?
349	00:24:02	00:24:05	He's been off a couple days now.
350	00:24:05	00:24:10	Did you know, uh, Noy or Keo Vipraxay?
351	00:24:10	00:24:12	Sure. They work here, too.
352	00:24:12	00:24:14	They brothers or cousins, or what?
353	00:24:14	00:24:16	Brothers. Keo's older.
354	00:24:16	00:24:19	I hear they got six more back in Laos.
355	00:24:19	00:24:21	00.
356	00:24:21	00:24:23	Were they friends of Samay's?
357	00:24:23	00:24:25	No! No way.
358	00:24:26	00:24:29	Keo and Noy are Lao Loum.
359	00:24:29	00:24:30	They're lowlanders.
360	00:24:30	00:24:32	Samay's Hmong; he's in the hills.
361	00:24:32	00:24:35	They're born to hate each other. Some tribal crap.
362	00:24:35	00:24:37	What kind of trouble are they in?
363	00:24:37	00:24:39	The kind where you stop breathing.
364	00:24:40	00:24:42	Noy's dead-- car accident.
365	00:24:42	00:24:44	Samay's dead, too-- Keo shot him.
366	00:24:56	00:24:57	You speak Lao?
367	00:24:57	00:25:00	And Thai, Vietnamese, Tagalog.
368	00:25:00	00:25:02	I pulled a stint straight out of high school.
369	00:25:02	00:25:05	I got Southeast Asia, lucky me.
370	00:25:05	00:25:06	Yeah, I know how you feel.
371	00:25:06	00:25:08	Did Keo tell you what happened?
372	00:25:08	00:25:10	I mean, his English isn't very good.
373	00:25:11	00:25:14	No, we're, uh, we're still waiting on an interpreter.
374	00:25:14	00:25:17	If you need any help, you let me know.
375	00:25:17	00:25:19	Yeah, maybe... maybe I'll take you up on that.
376	00:25:50	00:25:51	Willie Angel?
377	00:25:54	00:25:57	You can't fool the eye in the sky, Willie.
378	00:25:57	00:25:58	There's a lot of people looking for you.
379	00:25:59	00:26:02	Okay, you got me.
380	00:26:02	00:26:03	What do you want?
381	00:26:03	00:26:04	Hey, what are you doing?
382	00:26:04	00:26:06	Hey, you can't do that.
383	00:26:06	00:26:07	Oh, this here says we can.
384	00:26:13	00:26:16	Ho-ho-ho! Slick Willie.
385	00:26:16	00:26:17	Look out now.
386	00:26:17	00:26:20	You collect card keys, Willie?
387	00:26:20	00:26:21	I won at those places. Really?
388	00:26:22	00:26:26	I hang on to them for good luck. Well, I bet you're real lucky with this cheap magnetic stripe reader and palm top, huh?
389	00:26:26	00:26:29	You know you can get into most hotel rooms in the city with this thing?
390	00:26:29	00:26:36	You take the old card key, you input the room number, a little magnetic encoding...
391	00:26:36	00:26:37	and Bob's your uncle.
392	00:26:41	00:26:44	You used the card to open the door.
393	00:26:45	00:26:47	You get into his suite and hide.
394	00:26:47	00:26:50	Julian comes back, falls asleep.
395	00:26:51	00:26:52	You rob him blind.
396	00:26:52	00:26:53	But he wakes up.
397	00:26:53	00:26:55	So it's kill him or go back to jail.
398	00:26:55	00:26:57	Right...? Who the hell are you?
399	00:26:57	00:26:58	Stop, okay?
400	00:26:58	00:27:00	Stop.
401	00:27:02	00:27:03	I was in his suite.
402	00:27:03	00:27:07	And, yeah, I'm a thief.
403	00:27:07	00:27:08	But I didn't kill anybody.
404	00:27:08	00:27:11	You were in his suite for over two hours, man.
405	00:27:11	00:27:14	That's more than enough time to snag a couple shopping bags.
406	00:27:14	00:27:17	'Cause that sick, rich freak wasn't going to sleep.
407	00:27:17	00:27:21	He was banging some blonde for, like, two hours.
408	00:27:24	00:27:25	Talk to her.
409	00:27:25	00:27:26	We're talking to you.
410	00:27:28	00:27:32	I don't know what the hell they were doing, but when she left, he wasn't moving.
411	00:27:32	00:27:34	I thought he was asleep.
412	00:27:34	00:27:37	Then I saw the news this morning.
413	00:27:37	00:27:40	If it's a killer you're looking for, talk to the girl in the red dress.
414	00:27:44	00:27:49	We believe that Samay Thao killed your brother and tried to make it look like an accident.
415	00:27:55	00:27:57	Did you know about it?
416	00:28:31	00:28:34	He says he thought Samay was there to rob him.
417	00:28:34	00:28:35	That's why he shot him.
418	00:28:49	00:28:54	The girl in the red dress gets off 57.
419	00:28:54	00:28:58	33.
420	00:28:58	00:29:00	Certainly looks like she's been through something rough.
421	00:29:02	00:29:03	She forgot her pantyhose.
422	00:29:06	00:29:07	Good eyes.
423	00:29:07	00:29:08	Great legs.
424	00:29:09	00:29:10	Been a while, Arch?
425	00:29:10	00:29:12	Can you follow her out?
426	00:29:12	00:29:13	Yeah. I just got this footage...
427	00:29:13	00:29:16	Hey, I heard you guys are having trouble with the Julian Harper case.
428	00:29:16	00:29:18	Who'd you hear that from? Ecklie. He's putting me on it.
429	00:29:18	00:29:21	Man, you gotta quit kissing his ass.
430	00:29:22	00:29:24	All right, fellas, check this out.
431	00:29:29	00:29:30	Okay, that's Julian's manager.
432	00:29:32	00:29:33	Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on.
433	00:29:39	00:29:40	That's got to be at least a few Gs.
434	00:29:40	00:29:42	She a hooker?
435	00:29:42	00:29:45	I don't know, I think she could be the killer.
436	00:29:45	00:29:46	Solicitation murder?
437	00:29:46	00:29:49	Manager pays to have her client whacked.
438	00:29:51	00:29:53	She went to the shopping arcade.
439	00:29:53	00:29:54	Wait a minute.
440	00:29:54	00:29:58	What kind of hired killer takes their payoff and goes to the mall?
441	00:29:58	00:29:59	I don't know.
442	00:30:02	00:30:04	This one put herself on a mailing list.
443	00:30:04	00:30:07	Tally Jordan. There's the phone number.
444	00:30:09	00:30:13	You call my cell, I answer, we talk.
445	00:30:13	00:30:18	And then you guys show up and arrest me at the pool, in front of my friends. Is that fair?
446	00:30:18	00:30:21	33.
447	00:30:21	00:30:23	A couple of minutes later, you're taking money from his manager.
448	00:30:25	00:30:27	I'm not a prostitute.
449	00:30:27	00:30:29	Couple hours later, Julian's dead.
450	00:30:33	00:30:35	Okay, this is crazy.
451	00:30:35	00:30:39	I would never even think of killing Julian Harper.
452	00:30:39	00:30:41	I've been a fan of his since he was doing cereal commercials.
453	00:30:41	00:30:43	Oh, so you stalked him?
454	00:30:43	00:30:45	Is that it?
455	00:30:45	00:30:46	And then you killed him?
456	00:30:51	00:30:56	I'm in Vegas for a speech tournament-- okay, a school- supervised trip.
457	00:30:56	00:30:58	Does that mean that my school is stalking him, too?
458	00:30:58	00:31:03	Is the club Skin on your school schedule?
459	00:31:07	00:31:13	When I found out that Julian was going to be in Vegas at the same time I was, I freaked.
460	00:31:13	00:31:20	Okay, I wanted a look, an autograph, or a picture at most.
461	00:31:20	00:31:23	And what I got was incredible.
462	00:31:24	00:31:25	Go for it.
463	00:31:25	00:31:27	You're the one he wants.
464	00:31:34	00:31:37	It was like I was in one of his movies.
465	00:31:38	00:31:41	Until he kicked me out of bed and...
466	00:31:41	00:31:45	and then I get off the elevator, and there's his manager handing me a wad of money.
467	00:31:46	00:31:49	I tip all the girls Julian's with.
468	00:31:49	00:31:52	So you're his pimp?
469	00:31:52	00:31:54	It keeps them from running their mouths.
470	00:31:54	00:31:56	It protects Julian's image.
471	00:31:56	00:31:58	It's just a part of managing his career.
472	00:31:58	00:32:00	I had sex with Julian because I wanted to.
473	00:32:00	00:32:04	But you took the money, and you bought a purse with it.
474	00:32:04	00:32:07	I had a conversation with Julian's lawyer.
475	00:32:07	00:32:12	And he said you weren't only his ex-wife, you were about to be his ex-manager.
476	00:32:12	00:32:13	That piss you off?
477	00:32:13	00:32:18	His lawyers and his agents don't like me.
478	00:32:18	00:32:20	They pressured him to drop me.
479	00:32:20	00:32:22	But Julian and I are family.
480	00:32:22	00:32:23	That wasn't going to happen.
481	00:32:23	00:32:28	Eva said if anyone asked, Julian was a gentleman.
482	00:32:28	00:32:32	Later he took me out and got me a Katherine Baumann purse.
483	00:32:32	00:32:36	It's a much better story to tell my friends.
484	00:32:40	00:32:44	Samay and Noy go for a drive after work.
485	00:32:44	00:32:46	They stop at Mount Charleston.
486	00:32:50	00:32:52	Samay kills Noy...
487	00:32:58	00:33:00	...and makes it look like an accident.
488	00:33:03	00:33:08	And then he goes to Keo's apartment and Keo shoots him, claiming self defense.
489	00:33:08	00:33:09	I don't buy it.
490	00:33:09	00:33:12	Keo shot him from the other side of a locked door.
491	00:33:12	00:33:14	He was waiting to blow the guy away.
492	00:33:14	00:33:17	Which indicates that Keo knew Samay was coming.
493	00:33:17	00:33:21	Maybe he hired Samay to kill his brother, and then he decided to cut him out of the deal.
494	00:33:21	00:33:27	Noy had a life insurance policy issued through his union, worth ten grand.
495	00:33:27	00:33:28	Life's getting cheaper.
496	00:33:28	00:33:29	Who's the beneficiary?
497	00:33:29	00:33:32	Keo was the primary, but check this out.
498	00:33:32	00:33:35	Half the payout goes to Joe Cavanaugh.
499	00:33:38	00:33:40	He's not a court-approved translator.
500	00:33:40	00:33:42	That's why I taped it.
501	00:33:42	00:33:44	I just didn't tell him.
502	00:33:44	00:33:49	So far, he's saying what you asked him.
503	00:33:49	00:33:51	You must help me.
504	00:33:51	00:33:54	That's why I'm here.
505	00:33:54	00:33:56	Just tell them what they want to know.
506	00:33:56	00:33:58	This is the part that's different.
507	00:34:00	00:34:07	There are many things I can tell him about you, Samay came to my home.
508	00:34:07	00:34:09	I was afraid.
509	00:34:09	00:34:12	I thought he was there to rob me or kill me.
510	00:34:12	00:34:13	So I shot him.
511	00:34:13	00:34:16	So our interpreter is hiding something.
512	00:34:16	00:34:18	Well, that's not lost in translation.
513	00:34:26	00:34:28	Mr. Cavanaugh, can you come out here, please?
514	00:34:32	00:34:34	We're going to have a private chat.
515	00:34:34	00:34:36	Let's go.
516	00:34:45	00:34:50	In the interview, remember Keo said, There are many things I can tell them about you?
517	00:34:50	00:34:53	You didn't tell me that. You left that part out. Why?
518	00:34:53	00:34:55	I told you what he said.
519	00:34:55	00:34:57	You're not arresting me because I screwed up my translation?
520	00:34:57	00:35:00	You're a co-beneficiary of Noy Vipraxay's life insurance, right?
521	00:35:00	00:35:02	So what?
522	00:35:02	00:35:05	I help my guys try to get a little security for their families.
523	00:35:05	00:35:07	I help them in a lot of ways.
524	00:35:07	00:35:10	Driver's licenses, green cards...
525	00:35:10	00:35:11	Oh, what, what?
526	00:35:11	00:35:12	Out of the goodness of your heart?
527	00:35:12	00:35:14	Come on, they have to come to you.
528	00:35:14	00:35:17	Without me, they're back in a rice paddy making three cents a day.
529	00:35:17	00:35:19	Look, some of these guys put me on their policy.
530	00:35:19	00:35:21	It's their way of saying thank you.
531	00:35:21	00:35:24	So when one of your guys kills another one of your guys, you make money out of it?
532	00:35:24	00:35:28	We both know that insurance companies don't even investigate claims under ten grand.
533	00:35:28	00:35:30	So you get a free pass.
534	00:35:30	00:35:33	You don't really think I'd have somebody killed for five grand?
535	00:35:33	00:35:34	I've seen it done for a lot less.
536	00:35:34	00:35:37	That don't mean I did it.
537	00:35:37	00:35:40	There's new casinos that open all the time.
538	00:35:40	00:35:42	They all got laundries.
539	00:35:42	00:35:45	I bring home 15 G's a month on the side.
540	00:35:45	00:35:49	So I am not going to bend over a dollar to pick up a dime.
541	00:35:50	00:35:56	Hodges, do you have the results on the fibers that we dropped off to...?
542	00:36:00	00:36:01	Hodges?
543	00:36:02	00:36:03	He's asleep.
544	00:36:08	00:36:13	Let me guess, the fibers are wool.
545	00:36:14	00:36:15	Are you bagging Z's right now, man?
546	00:36:15	00:36:17	I was just having the greatest dream.
547	00:36:17	00:36:18	You were out.
548	00:36:18	00:36:21	It was the '80s and I had this Don Johnson beard, you know, the Miami Vice stubble.
549	00:36:22	00:36:24	It just gave me this air of danger.
550	00:36:24	00:36:25	My lady loved it.
551	00:36:27	00:36:32	Um, I found two types of fibers on your guy's chin.
552	00:36:32	00:36:34	Cotton and a polyester- lycra blend.
553	00:36:34	00:36:35	Both dyed black.
554	00:36:37	00:36:39	Dyed black?
555	00:36:39	00:36:42	The bedding might have been cotton, but it wasn't black.
556	00:36:42	00:36:46	The comforter and draperies may have been poly, but they weren't black, either.
557	00:36:46	00:36:49	I bagged some black socks and some black pantyhose.
558	00:36:51	00:36:53	This could be the source of the fibers.
559	00:36:53	00:36:56	He wasn't suffocated with his crew sock.
560	00:37:00	00:37:06	Did you notice the burn mark on the knot in these pantyhose at the crime scene?
561	00:37:06	00:37:09	No. No, they were all balled up.
562	00:37:09	00:37:12	I just bagged them and tagged them.
563	00:37:12	00:37:14	Oh, yeah.
564	00:37:14	00:37:17	Yeah, we've got to get this to DNA.
565	00:37:20	00:37:22	I thought Greg was in the field.
566	00:37:22	00:37:23	Is he back in the lab? I don't know.
567	00:37:23	00:37:26	We've got to clear this up. It's like he's confused.
568	00:37:26	00:37:28	Lab, field, field, lab. We have a lab on wheels.
569	00:37:28	00:37:30	How about you guys just shut up, all right?
570	00:37:31	00:37:33	I'm doing this as a favor for Ecklie.
571	00:37:33	00:37:35	It's a one-time thing.
572	00:37:35	00:37:36	He's still interviewing lab techs.
573	00:37:36	00:37:37	You making overtime?
574	00:37:37	00:37:39	I'm taking one for the team.
575	00:37:39	00:37:40	Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
576	00:37:40	00:37:41	Tell me about these pantyhose.
577	00:37:41	00:37:48	Well, I found Tally's epithelials on the inside, which is no surprise, since she was wearing them.
578	00:37:48	00:37:53	I also found black cotton fibers on the outside-- highest concentration near the crotch.
579	00:37:53	00:37:55	Insert joke here.
580	00:37:55	00:37:57	The vic had a pair of black cotton socks.
581	00:37:57	00:38:01	Well, I did find black cotton fibers under his chin.
582	00:38:01	00:38:06	Okay, transfer from the sock to the pantyhose, to the neck.
583	00:38:06	00:38:09	So the sock was in between the pantyhose and the neck?
584	00:38:09	00:38:11	Padding.
585	00:38:11	00:38:13	BCP, Breath Control Play.
586	00:38:13	00:38:16	Couples increase their partner's pleasure through strangulation.
587	00:38:16	00:38:18	And if you're not careful, it leaves marks.
588	00:38:18	00:38:24	Yeah, this guy Julian Harper's an actor, so I'm sure he didn't want bruises on his neck to be showing on camera.
589	00:38:24	00:38:26	There were only two girls in the suite.
590	00:38:26	00:38:28	Which one of them killed him?
591	00:38:28	00:38:30	Burnt pantyhose.
592	00:38:30	00:38:34	Okay, evidence of sex games gone wrong.
593	00:38:34	00:38:37	I don't see how we could have missed anything.
594	00:38:37	00:38:38	There's no fireplace here.
595	00:38:38	00:38:41	I haven't seen any lighters.
596	00:38:41	00:38:43	Well, something singed the hose.
597	00:39:02	00:39:03	Hey.
598	00:39:03	00:39:04	Hmm?
599	00:39:04	00:39:07	There's some burnt residue on this lamp.
600	00:39:11	00:39:13	You know what I think?
601	00:39:13	00:39:19	I think someone tied him up, and they couldn't get the knot undone, because it melted.
602	00:39:19	00:39:22	So they panicked.
603	00:39:22	00:39:24	And they pulled the hose down.
604	00:39:24	00:39:27	I'll print the light.
605	00:39:28	00:39:33	I guess even having an unlimited supply of hot women is not enough, huh?
606	00:39:33	00:39:36	Bondage sex with your best friend?
607	00:39:36	00:39:39	It's cool, you guys were on the down low.
608	00:39:39	00:39:40	I don't understand.
609	00:39:41	00:39:46	Well, we found both your prints and Julian's prints on a light fixture above the bed.
610	00:39:46	00:39:48	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
611	00:39:48	00:39:49	We were not down like that.
612	00:39:49	00:39:51	Rise and shine, buddy!
613	00:39:51	00:39:52	Room service.
614	00:39:55	00:39:57	Dude, Julian?
615	00:40:06	00:40:08	He did it to himself, man.
616	00:40:08	00:40:10	He did it to himself.
617	00:40:10	00:40:14	I took the pantyhose, and I took them off the light.
618	00:40:14	00:40:16	And then I put his boxers back on.
619	00:40:19	00:40:25	I wasn't going to let his mom open up Us magazine and see her boy like that.
620	00:40:25	00:40:29	Jules, he always did me right.
621	00:40:29	00:40:32	Now I just wanted to do him the same.
622	00:40:34	00:40:38	I got the serial number run down from Keo's shotgun.
623	00:40:38	00:40:42	He bought it last week, two days before he shot Samay.
624	00:40:42	00:40:47	The guy's barely scraping by, and he spends $250 on a brand-new Mossberg?
625	00:40:47	00:40:48	There's a word for that.
626	00:40:49	00:40:50	Premeditation.
627	00:40:50	00:40:53	Your brother gets killed. You killed the guy who did it with a shotgun you just bought.
628	00:40:54	00:40:56	And end up $5,000 ahead.
629	00:41:02	00:41:04	In Nevada, that's murder one.
630	00:41:04	00:41:07	20 years to life.
631	00:41:07	00:41:09	Unless you get the death sentence.
632	00:41:11	00:41:14	What are my client's options?
633	00:41:14	00:41:15	A full confession.
634	00:41:15	00:41:19	We make a recommendation to the DA, maybe he gets murder two.
635	00:41:25	00:41:27	I brought Noy here to help me.
636	00:41:28	00:41:29	What?
637	00:41:29	00:41:31	To work hard and save.
638	00:41:31	00:41:35	To bring our family here.
639	00:41:35	00:41:37	Our parent.
640	00:41:37	00:41:39	Our sister.
641	00:41:39	00:41:42	My wife.
642	00:41:42	00:41:44	Instead he waste the money.
643	00:41:44	00:41:50	On the DVD, gambling, clothes.
644	00:41:52	00:41:56	Noy's life was worthless.
645	00:41:56	00:42:00	His death is not.
646	00:42:09	00:42:11	Griss, we closed that actor case.
647	00:42:11	00:42:13	And?
648	00:42:13	00:42:16	Accidental death as a result of auto-erotic asphyxiation.
649	00:42:16	00:42:20	Strangled himself to death to enhance his own pleasure.
650	00:42:22	00:42:29	It was in the days of public hangings that people first noticed that men would get erections and sometimes even ejaculate.
651	00:42:29	00:42:33	They called it the killer orgasm.
652	00:42:33	00:42:35	It's a waste.
653	00:42:36	00:42:38	Guy had everything-- money, fame...
654	00:42:38	00:42:41	Yeah, look where he ended up.
