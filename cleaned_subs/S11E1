2,00:00:09,00:00:10,"Hey, last time I checked, CSI worked for me."
3,00:00:10,00:00:13,You need me; I don't need you.
4,00:00:13,00:00:15,I give you good information. I got you to the place.
5,00:00:15,00:00:17,STOKES:Go back there and see what that guy's going.
6,00:00:17,00:00:19,(gunshots) Clark!
7,00:00:19,00:00:21,"Come on, I'll buy you a drink at P.J.'s. I'll catch up to you."
8,00:00:21,00:00:23,You killed Jekyll.
9,00:00:23,00:00:25,You look like you came out of it relatively unscathed.
10,00:00:25,00:00:26,"Good-bye, Nate."

18,00:00:59,00:01:02,I need emergency to lockup right now.
19,00:01:02,00:01:03,Come on. Come on...
20,00:01:03,00:01:04,Let's move!

26,00:01:15,00:01:16,"Ray, it's Catherine."
27,00:01:16,00:01:18,It's okay.
28,00:01:18,00:01:20,You're gonna be just fine.
29,00:01:20,00:01:21,"EMT: All right, guys, watch out. We're coming through!"
30,00:01:21,00:01:24,"Stay with me, Ray."
31,00:01:24,00:01:26,Get set up. NURSE: I've tried paging ultrasound.
32,00:01:26,00:01:28,They're not responding.
33,00:01:28,00:01:30,Go another one coming in-- watch it!
34,00:01:30,00:01:32,DOCTOR: Call respiratory-- I'm gonna need to intubate him.
35,00:01:32,00:01:33,"Okay, set him here."
36,00:01:33,00:01:35,"DOCTOR: Ray, can you hear me?"
37,00:01:35,00:01:37,NURSE: Respiratory on the way.
38,00:01:37,00:01:39,Can you hear me?
39,00:01:39,00:01:40,Ray?
40,00:01:42,00:01:44,He can wait.
41,00:01:45,00:01:48,DOCTOR: He's seizing... Give me five milligrams of Perced.
42,00:01:48,00:01:50,Open the I.V.-- wide open.

47,00:02:01,00:02:03,DOCTOR: Prep O.R.
48,00:02:03,00:02:05,"Gotta open him up, see what's going on inside."
49,00:02:06,00:02:07,Call X-Ray! Got a stat chest!
50,00:02:10,00:02:12,Ray...
51,00:02:12,00:02:15,would you like to pray together?
52,00:02:15,00:02:17,Don't be ashamed.
53,00:02:17,00:02:19,All the others did.

62,00:02:41,00:02:43,"You're gonna be okay. All right, let's move him. Here we go."
63,00:02:46,00:02:48,"TECH: Clear, please!"
64,00:03:24,00:03:32,"(quietly): I know your heart's in the right place, Nick, but the family, would be more comfortable if you weren't here."
65,00:03:32,00:03:38,"Now, I've been where you are, I know how you feel, but sometimes the best thing is just to walk away."
66,00:03:38,00:03:41,Okay?
67,00:03:41,00:03:44,That's the right thing.
68,00:03:50,00:03:55,ECKLIE: Officer Franklin Clark died a hero.
69,00:03:55,00:04:02,"He wore the badge proudly, and he saw his life tragically cut short when he put duty ahead of all else."
70,00:04:04,00:04:08,He will be remembered as a family man...
71,00:04:08,00:04:10,as a friend...
72,00:04:10,00:04:21,"and all of us who knew him, who will always remember him, we stand shoulder to shoulder in honoring his memory."
73,00:04:24,00:04:31,"To Officer Clark's children, Tarik and Brandon, we promise you today..."
74,00:04:31,00:04:37,(over radio): that we will never let you forget what a great man your dad was.
75,00:04:37,00:04:39,Go back there and see what that guy's doing.
76,00:04:40,00:04:44,ECKLIE: And as you stand with your family...
77,00:04:47,00:04:51,"...know that we are your family, too."
78,00:04:51,00:04:53,You will never be alone.

94,00:06:38,00:06:41,(gunshots)
95,00:06:41,00:06:42,There's another bomb!
96,00:07:28,00:07:30,"ECKLIE: Yeah, three explosions, yes."
97,00:07:30,00:07:37,"Two fatalities, about, uh, a dozen injured, three critical."
98,00:07:38,00:07:41,"Well, it could have been a lot worse."
99,00:07:41,00:07:45,"No, Mr. Mayor, I'm not trying to minimize the situation."
100,00:07:45,00:07:47,"Look, do yourself a favor, turn on your television."
101,00:07:47,00:07:49,Nicky... can you hear me?
102,00:07:50,00:07:53,Tinnitis. (vomits)
103,00:07:53,00:07:54,It's temporary. So is the nausea.
104,00:07:54,00:07:57,Normal after you get hit with a blast wave.
105,00:07:58,00:08:01,(loudly): I think I popped a couple stitches.
106,00:08:01,00:08:02,What tipped you off?
107,00:08:02,00:08:06,What? What tipped you off about the explosion?
108,00:08:06,00:08:07,Periplaneta Americana.
109,00:08:07,00:08:12,"Cockroaches? Yeah, they were all over the van-- you know, daylight's not really their thing."
110,00:08:12,00:08:17,"I think they were attracted to the clicking sound of the detonators, like a mating call or something."
111,00:08:17,00:08:18,"Hey, thank God Okay."
112,00:08:18,00:08:19,"you're okay, Nick."
113,00:08:19,00:08:21,Nate Haskell did this.
114,00:08:21,00:08:25,"And if he'd stayed in prison where he belongs, I wouldn't have lost two of my men."
115,00:08:25,00:08:28,It's always easy to quarterback after the fact.
116,00:08:28,00:08:34,"Bomb squad says it's all clear, it's yours. All right, well, I'm gonna need video from all the news teams."
117,00:08:34,00:08:36,On the ground and in the air. Okay.
118,00:08:37,00:08:40,Catch up with you later.
119,00:08:42,00:08:44,"Oh, Nicky, why are you flanking me?"
120,00:08:44,00:08:46,You've already been a hero today.
121,00:08:46,00:08:48,Go to the hospital.
122,00:08:48,00:08:50,I can't hear you. The hospital!
123,00:08:50,00:08:52,Not so fast.
124,00:08:52,00:08:54,This jacket's evidence.
125,00:08:54,00:08:57,"Now, that was my best suit."
126,00:08:57,00:08:59,Have you seen your car?
127,00:09:03,00:09:12,"NEWSMAN: Investigators are combing through the debris, looking for clues that might identify the perpetrators of this horrendous crime."
128,00:09:12,00:09:15,No one has stepped forward to claim credit for the bombing.
129,00:09:15,00:09:17,Sources within LVPD admit they have no solid lead...
130,00:09:17,00:09:18,"How you feeling, man?"
131,00:09:18,00:09:22,(sighs quietly)
132,00:09:22,00:09:23,How's Nick?
133,00:09:23,00:09:25,He's lucky to be alive.
134,00:09:26,00:09:30,LANGSTON: That's the fourth bomb dog in five minutes.
135,00:09:30,00:09:31,Should we evacuate?
136,00:09:31,00:09:33,Just a precaution.
137,00:09:33,00:09:35,(labored breathing)
138,00:09:35,00:09:38,"You know what this button's for, right?"
139,00:09:38,00:09:41,Morphine clouds my thinking.
140,00:09:41,00:09:42,Okay.
141,00:09:42,00:09:45,You're thinking Haskell did this?
142,00:09:45,00:09:47,But how'd he do it?
143,00:09:47,00:09:50,"I mean, his mail and his phone calls are monitored by the penitentiary."
144,00:09:50,00:09:53,He has no contact with other inmates.
145,00:09:53,00:09:54,He'd have had to have outside help.
146,00:09:54,00:09:56,"I mean, he's used acolytes before."
147,00:09:58,00:10:02,"I need my laptop... and my cell phone, Jim."
148,00:10:02,00:10:03,"Come on, Ray, give it a rest."
149,00:10:03,00:10:05,Don't forget my charger.
150,00:10:06,00:10:08,Okay.
151,00:10:09,00:10:11,I still owe you that drink.
152,00:10:11,00:10:12,Jim...
153,00:10:12,00:10:15,"you talk to Haskell, you play your game, not his."
154,00:10:15,00:10:17,(quietly): Okay.
155,00:10:22,00:10:25,Man's got an amazing attitude for a guy who lost a kidney.
156,00:10:25,00:10:27,Does he know that? Mm-hmm.
157,00:10:27,00:10:30,"Fortunately, God gave him two."
158,00:10:38,00:10:40,How's Ray?
159,00:10:42,00:10:45,He's gonna make a full recovery.
160,00:10:45,00:10:47,Thank goodness.
161,00:10:47,00:10:54,"I want Ray to live a long, long time, so that every time he unzips his pants to take a leak he'll think of me."
162,00:10:54,00:10:58,"Yeah, he'll always remember what a putz you are."
163,00:10:58,00:11:00,"You know, you're a smart guy, Nate."
164,00:11:00,00:11:03,You've been three steps ahead of us during this whole game.
165,00:11:03,00:11:04,Four.
166,00:11:04,00:11:06,"Well, five."
167,00:11:06,00:11:10,But you're here to see if I decided to go out...
168,00:11:10,00:11:12,with a bang.
169,00:11:12,00:11:14,Did you?
170,00:11:14,00:11:16,What's different about you?
171,00:11:16,00:11:17,This has been so nice.
172,00:11:17,00:11:19,You're my first visitor.
173,00:11:19,00:11:21,Let me guess.
174,00:11:21,00:11:29,"The blast turned over this new kinder, gentler leaf in you. If you don't mind, I'd like to eat my lunch."
175,00:11:29,00:11:31,"Could you untie me, please?"
176,00:11:35,00:11:37,Bon appétit.
177,00:11:37,00:11:42,Your next meal will be through a hole in a cell door.
178,00:11:42,00:11:43,Take him back to Ely.
179,00:11:49,00:11:50,(sighs)
180,00:11:50,00:11:57,"WOMAN: Those, uh, prills are unexploded ammonium nitrate from your van bomb."
181,00:11:57,00:12:06,"You know, you're lucky only one of those barrels went off, or we'd be scraping you up off the pavement with a putty knife, or a spatula. Yeah."
182,00:12:06,00:12:08,"New bomb tech, huh?"
183,00:12:08,00:12:09,"You're Monahan, right?"
184,00:12:09,00:12:14,Anyone crazy enough to wave a pistol at 100 armed cops...
185,00:12:14,00:12:16,You can call me Kacey.
186,00:12:16,00:12:18,Copy that.
187,00:12:18,00:12:21,"All right, the brains of the bomb are usually within the first 20 yards."
188,00:12:21,00:12:23,Heavier stuff flies farther.
189,00:12:23,00:12:25,Detonators tend to be light.
190,00:12:25,00:12:30,And the brains should lead us to our big bad bomber.
191,00:13:11,00:13:16,Bomb was designed to maximize chaos... injuries.
192,00:13:16,00:13:21,"Well, the good news-- it's left us a lot of evidence."
193,00:13:48,00:13:51,That looks like brain matter.
194,00:13:54,00:13:56,(inhales)
195,00:13:56,00:13:58,Cell phone detonator.
196,00:13:58,00:14:00,I haven't seen one of these since Iraq.
197,00:14:00,00:14:03,Does a cell phone trigger make a clicking sound?
198,00:14:03,00:14:05,Not usually.
199,00:14:05,00:14:08,We have got three different bombs.
200,00:14:08,00:14:11,"Which means, there's possibly three detonators."
201,00:14:11,00:14:14,WILLOWS: This is a composite image of the bomb site.
202,00:14:14,00:14:18,GCMS identified residue from the casket and tombstone bombs as smokeless gunpowder.
203,00:14:18,00:14:21,"Specifically, Nosumi Pro Formula Four."
204,00:14:21,00:14:23,You can buy it at any gun store.
205,00:14:23,00:14:28,What it tells us is that the first two bombs were low explosive devices.
206,00:14:28,00:14:30,Low explosive. Why?
207,00:14:30,00:14:32,"Easy to acquire, easy to build."
208,00:14:32,00:14:34,The van bomb's a different story.
209,00:14:34,00:14:36,It's high-explosive.
210,00:14:36,00:14:38,"ANFO-- Ammonium Nitrate, Fuel Oil."
211,00:14:38,00:14:41,Same stuff that destroyed the Federal Building in Oklahoma City.
212,00:14:41,00:14:43,"WILLOWS: Yeah, it was the kill bomb."
213,00:14:43,00:14:45,"Well, how do we think the bombs got there?"
214,00:14:45,00:14:48,The casket bomb was placed with Officer Clark's body at the funeral home.
215,00:14:48,00:14:50,It's open 24/7. There's no security.
216,00:14:50,00:15:00,"The Claymore was placed in a flower arrangement, which was delivered by a company called, uh, Bouquet Builders. Now, they reported their van stolen two days ago."
217,00:15:00,00:15:03,Let's go back to the low explosive devices.
218,00:15:03,00:15:09,"First one-- the casket bomb, was designed to scare, not to kill."
219,00:15:09,00:15:13,"(explosion, people screaming)"
220,00:15:13,00:15:16,LANGSTON: Cops are trained to take cover under fire.
221,00:15:16,00:15:21,"The only cover was the tombstones, right in the path of the second bomb."
222,00:15:23,00:15:28,There was only one way to go-- right into the path of the van bomb.
223,00:15:28,00:15:30,(beeping quietly)
224,00:15:33,00:15:35,(people screaming)
225,00:15:35,00:15:37,Shock.
226,00:15:37,00:15:39,Run.
227,00:15:39,00:15:41,Kill.
228,00:15:41,00:15:44,"Bombers are unlike any other criminals, except poisoners."
229,00:15:44,00:15:50,"They plan meticulously, they nurse long grudges, and they retaliate far out of proportion to any injury they feel they've received."
230,00:15:50,00:15:52,That sounds like Nate Haskell.
231,00:15:52,00:15:55,Nate Haskell likes to kill people one at a time.
232,00:15:55,00:15:59,"Yeah, he gets off on the intimacy of inflicting pain and slow death."
233,00:15:59,00:16:00,He's not one for mass murder.
234,00:16:00,00:16:01,Are you saying it wasn't Nate Haskell?
235,00:16:01,00:16:03,Yes.
236,00:16:03,00:16:05,Then who the hell is it?
237,00:16:05,00:16:08,Someone with a grudge against cops.
238,00:16:22,00:16:24,(groans)
239,00:16:28,00:16:31,(sighs)
240,00:16:31,00:16:33,"Go home, Nicky."
241,00:16:33,00:16:34,You're tired.
242,00:16:37,00:16:39,"No, I'm-I'm... I'm okay."
243,00:16:39,00:16:40,"I mean, everybody's tired, right?"
244,00:16:40,00:16:43,Everybody wasn't shot and then blown up.
245,00:16:43,00:16:44,(laughs quietly)
246,00:16:44,00:16:46,It's not funny.
247,00:16:46,00:16:48,I almost lost you.
248,00:16:48,00:16:50,I almost lost Ray.
249,00:16:50,00:16:56,And I don't want to lose this case because you're maxed out.
250,00:16:56,00:16:58,You need to sit down with the department shrink.
251,00:16:58,00:17:01,"Oh, come on. It's mandatory after a shooting incident."
252,00:17:01,00:17:03,"Yeah, I-I know the rules."
253,00:17:03,00:17:04,"But it's not about rules, Nicky."
254,00:17:04,00:17:06,It's about you.
255,00:17:06,00:17:12,"Look, the time I waste talking to a shrink is time I could be helping you out on this case."
256,00:17:12,00:17:15,You can't just John Wayne this like everything else.
257,00:17:15,00:17:17,(sighs)
258,00:17:18,00:17:32,"After losing Warrick, I thought, if I just worked hard enough, if I focused completely on the cases that I... I wouldn't have to think about his death."
259,00:17:33,00:17:38,There isn't enough work in the world...
260,00:17:42,00:17:49,I realized that I couldn't do my job without talking to somebody.
261,00:17:49,00:17:51,I never knew that about you.
262,00:17:51,00:17:52,"Well, I'm..."
263,00:17:52,00:17:55,I'm good at hiding things.
264,00:17:55,00:17:57,Like you.
265,00:17:57,00:17:59,(sighs)
266,00:17:59,00:18:03,"Just ask yourself this, okay?"
267,00:18:04,00:18:13,"If you got a callout tomorrow to the restaurant where you got shot and Officer Clark died, could you focus?"
268,00:18:13,00:18:16,Could you be there for your team?
269,00:18:16,00:18:20,Would you want you backing you up right now?
270,00:18:23,00:18:25,Make that call.
271,00:18:30,00:18:31,(camera shutter clicking)
272,00:18:39,00:18:41,Officers Morales and Hooper.
273,00:18:41,00:18:43,Both had kids.
274,00:18:51,00:18:53,(camera shutter clicks)
275,00:18:53,00:18:56,This poor soul's been through here twice.
276,00:18:56,00:18:59,"Once in the line of duty, and then a bomb."
277,00:18:59,00:19:01,Makes you want to slug someone.
278,00:19:01,00:19:03,And then some.
279,00:19:03,00:19:06,Explosive must have been beneath his thorax.
280,00:19:06,00:19:09,Trauma lessens as it moves out from there.
281,00:19:09,00:19:11,Mostly plastic and wire. No shrapnel.
282,00:19:11,00:19:17,Consistent with our theory that the coffin bomb was designed to cause panic.
283,00:19:17,00:19:21,I can't stop thinking about his family.
284,00:19:21,00:19:26,Losing a husband is horrible enough without the funeral ending up like this.
285,00:19:26,00:19:28,I spoke to his wife.
286,00:19:28,00:19:30,Told her he was already in a better place.
287,00:19:30,00:19:32,Do you believe that?
288,00:19:32,00:19:36,I believe that it helped her.
289,00:19:47,00:19:52,Hmm... Maybe Officer Clark just helped us.
290,00:19:59,00:20:02,I may have found the bomber's signature.
291,00:20:02,00:20:06,You see the way the wires are twisted and then soldered?
292,00:20:06,00:20:11,"Well, if you put a wire on a post and then twist it, most people are happy with that."
293,00:20:11,00:20:13,"This guy soldered it, too."
294,00:20:13,00:20:16,He didn't leave anything to chance.
295,00:20:16,00:20:18,He is meticulous.
296,00:20:18,00:20:20,Maybe even OCD.
297,00:20:20,00:20:23,Sounds like you admire this guy.
298,00:20:23,00:20:25,"(laughs) Yeah, I admire the work."
299,00:20:25,00:20:29,Doc Robbins just pulled this SIM card out of Officer Clark's body.
300,00:20:29,00:20:32,You want to bet that's from the cell phone that detonated the casket bomb?
301,00:20:32,00:20:36,"SANDERS: Let's plug it in, and see who reached out and touched someone."
302,00:20:59,00:21:02,(beeping)
303,00:21:02,00:21:05,"Hey, bomber, we got your number."
304,00:21:05,00:21:08,So the cell number came back to a Thomas Rand.
305,00:21:08,00:21:09,He's a local kid.
306,00:21:09,00:21:11,A Marine deployed to Afghanistan.
307,00:21:11,00:21:16,"Says here he was a demolition specialist, 4th Engineers, 1st Marines."
308,00:21:16,00:21:17,So the guy knows bombs.
309,00:21:17,00:21:21,"Yeah, but if you look at the bottom of the page, he was killed in action last month."
310,00:21:21,00:21:24,"Well, maybe a friend or relative is looking for payback, huh?"
311,00:21:24,00:21:27,"Well, that's just what I'm going to ask his wife."
312,00:21:33,00:21:34,Mrs. Rand.
313,00:21:34,00:21:35,(clears throat)
314,00:21:35,00:21:37,Hello.
315,00:21:37,00:21:39,Thank you for coming in.
316,00:21:39,00:21:41,I'm Captain Jim Brass.
317,00:21:41,00:21:48,"Look, uh, I know your husband was killed recently, bravely serving our country in Afghanistan."
318,00:21:48,00:21:50,I'm sorry for your loss.
319,00:21:50,00:21:53,"Yeah, that's what the Marines said when they came to the house."
320,00:21:53,00:21:55,The insurance agent...
321,00:21:55,00:21:57,"Mrs. Rand, I know. I... I'm a former Marine."
322,00:21:57,00:21:58,I served in Vietnam.
323,00:21:58,00:22:01,I saw a lot. I lost a lot of friends. I understand your anger.
324,00:22:01,00:22:04,"My daughter is four, and I have a son on the way."
325,00:22:04,00:22:05,All right.
326,00:22:05,00:22:08,"What'd you do with your husband's cell phone, the 0-1-0-1 number?"
327,00:22:10,00:22:11,I don't know.
328,00:22:11,00:22:14,I-I gave most of his stuff away to charity.
329,00:22:14,00:22:17,Why? Because it was used to detonate a bomb at a funeral.
330,00:22:19,00:22:21,Th-that policeman's funeral?
331,00:22:21,00:22:23,The-the one that's on the news?
332,00:22:23,00:22:25,Exactly.
333,00:22:25,00:22:26,"So, what'd you do with it? Who'd you give it to?"
334,00:22:26,00:22:28,A-A community center.
335,00:22:28,00:22:30,"Um, it was a charity drive."
336,00:22:30,00:22:32,They were collecting cell phones for soldiers.
337,00:22:32,00:22:34,Which community center?
338,00:22:34,00:22:37,MAN: Are you ready for a new America?
339,00:22:37,00:22:39,Where hard work pays off?
340,00:22:39,00:22:40,"(indistinct shouts, cheers)"
341,00:22:40,00:22:44,This country's been hijacked by profiteers!
342,00:22:44,00:22:48,"Big banks, Wall Street, giant corporations."
343,00:22:48,00:22:51,They have a license to steal at our expense.
344,00:22:51,00:22:54,(various shouts) Their credit cards keep us in debt.
345,00:22:54,00:22:56,That's it!
346,00:22:56,00:22:57,Their mortgages...
347,00:22:57,00:23:00,leverage the future of our families.
348,00:23:00,00:23:05,"So what I say is, we stop playing their game."
349,00:23:05,00:23:07,"(shouts, cheers)"
350,00:23:07,00:23:09,That's right!
351,00:23:09,00:23:13,Stop paying our taxes that pay for their failures.
352,00:23:13,00:23:15,Yes! Cut up your cards!
353,00:23:15,00:23:18,"Credit, driver's license, Social Security."
354,00:23:18,00:23:22,They can't control you if they can't find you.
355,00:23:22,00:23:23,"(cheering, shouting)"
356,00:23:23,00:23:34,"Sure, there are those who say, hold on there, hold on there, Dr. Huxbee-- why can't we reason with Washington?"
357,00:23:34,00:23:47,"HUXBEE: ...engage in constructive dialogue, change our country from inside the system?"" Brother Ralph Harvey went down that road, and where is he now?"
358,00:23:47,00:23:51,He's in jail! Brother Ralph was exercising his right...
359,00:23:51,00:23:54,to drive hisown car...
360,00:23:54,00:23:56,down a public road.
361,00:23:56,00:23:59,His crime: driving without a license.
362,00:23:59,00:24:01,Ralph is no criminal!
363,00:24:01,00:24:03,He's a decent man.
364,00:24:03,00:24:05,He took me and my brother when we didn't have anyone.
365,00:24:05,00:24:07,And now the government took him away from us.
366,00:24:07,00:24:09,And why?
367,00:24:09,00:24:15,Because Ralph dared to live as a new American.
368,00:24:15,00:24:18,And you see what happens when we speak truth to power.
369,00:24:18,00:24:21,The profiteers send in their mercenaries.
370,00:24:21,00:24:22,Las Vegas Police.
371,00:24:22,00:24:26,OFFICER: I need everyone to get up against the wall and let me see your hands.
372,00:24:26,00:24:30,Your authorities are not good here.
373,00:24:30,00:24:32,I'll give you authority if you don't get up against the wall.
374,00:24:32,00:24:34,"HUXBEE: Uh, no, no resistance, brothers and sisters."
375,00:24:34,00:24:36,Don't play their power game.
376,00:24:36,00:24:38,(clamoring)
377,00:24:46,00:24:49,"(labored breathing, monitor beeping)"
378,00:24:51,00:24:53,"Just say no, huh?"
379,00:24:53,00:24:55,"Hey, you pack a real... mean right hook."
380,00:24:55,00:24:58,"Like Gandhi, I turn the other cheek."
381,00:24:58,00:25:01,Just wasn't mine.
382,00:25:01,00:25:03,"Look, I been, uh..."
383,00:25:03,00:25:05,analyizing the blast patterns.
384,00:25:05,00:25:09,"We've confirmed one initial device, followed by two secondaries."
385,00:25:09,00:25:10,It's all about timing.
386,00:25:10,00:25:17,"If I'm the bomber, I'm not gonna set off those two explosions unless all of my targets are in the kill zone, right?"
387,00:25:17,00:25:20,"You think the bomber had ""eyes on."" He had to be there."
388,00:25:20,00:25:23,I've been looking for him in the news footage.
389,00:25:23,00:25:25,Here's what I've found.
390,00:25:27,00:25:30,That is not Southwest.
391,00:25:30,00:25:32,"No, it's a radio- controlled model."
392,00:25:32,00:25:34,Here's what caught my attention.
393,00:25:34,00:25:37,1: The casket bomb goes off.
394,00:25:37,00:25:39,Cell phone detonated.
395,00:25:39,00:25:40,2: The Claymore.
396,00:25:40,00:25:44,"At this point, the plane clearly loses control."
397,00:25:44,00:25:47,3: The van bomb goes off. Now...
398,00:25:47,00:25:54,a remote-controlled plane dips and crashes almost at the same time that the last two bombs go off.
399,00:25:54,00:25:56,They were radio-detonated.
400,00:25:56,00:25:58,Probably by the same controller.
401,00:25:58,00:25:59,Probably by whoever was flying the plane.
402,00:25:59,00:26:02,"Remote-controlled planes have a range of about 2,500 feet."
403,00:26:02,00:26:07,That means those last two explosions could have been set off from no more than a half a mile.
404,00:26:09,00:26:12,"Bomber's in the wind, but the plane isn't."
405,00:26:15,00:26:18,"That's it, kiddo. Have a seat."
406,00:26:22,00:26:24,"You got a wallet on you, boss?"
407,00:26:31,00:26:32,"No I.D., no credit card."
408,00:26:32,00:26:34,Do you got anything with your name on it?
409,00:26:34,00:26:35,I burned 'em.
410,00:26:35,00:26:37,Emancipated myself.
411,00:26:37,00:26:40,"Okay, well, congratulations, you're not gonna need 'em where you're going."
412,00:26:40,00:26:41,"Now, open up."
413,00:26:41,00:26:43,"We're on the same side, sister."
414,00:26:43,00:26:47,"I love this country, revere our Constitution."
415,00:26:47,00:26:50,But dark forces are afoot.
416,00:26:51,00:26:52,Think about who you really work for.
417,00:26:52,00:26:55,I work for the people of Clark County.
418,00:26:55,00:26:56,Do you?
419,00:26:56,00:26:58,Shut up.
420,00:26:58,00:27:00,BRASS: Released?
421,00:27:00,00:27:07,"Half of these dingbats were assaulting a police officer, including the one standing in front of you now. Yeah, I get it Jim, but you found no weapons or explosives on their premises."
422,00:27:07,00:27:11,"Oh, a cell phone from their center detonated the bomb, so someone had to be involved."
423,00:27:11,00:27:13,"Where's the evidence? Well, I don't know-- CSI's working on it."
424,00:27:13,00:27:15,It takes time.
425,00:27:15,00:27:16,These guys got no I.D.
426,00:27:16,00:27:19,"You let them go, they're in the wind, it's buh-bye."
427,00:27:19,00:27:24,"All right, we can legally hold them until we process the transitory evidence."
428,00:27:24,00:27:28,"Lab is backed up, I'm not inclined to approve overtime, so... I can buy you 24 hours."
429,00:27:28,00:27:31,Okay.
430,00:27:48,00:27:49,SANDERS: All right.
431,00:27:49,00:27:51,I'm here.
432,00:27:51,00:27:54,Got a perfect view of the grave site.
433,00:27:54,00:27:55,How far away are you?
434,00:27:55,00:27:57,At least a football field.
435,00:27:57,00:28:00,You're still well within range.
436,00:28:00,00:28:03,"Well, Ray, I don't see any plane around here."
437,00:28:03,00:28:05,Maybe he took it with him.
438,00:28:07,00:28:09,Nobody ever looks up.
439,00:28:09,00:28:11,Looks up what?
440,00:28:11,00:28:12,Looks up looks up.
441,00:28:12,00:28:14,In the sky.
442,00:28:14,00:28:17,"In ""plane"" sight."
443,00:28:34,00:28:36,(whirring)
444,00:28:41,00:28:45,You asked me if a cell phone detonator could make a click-click.
445,00:28:45,00:28:47,Answer: No.
446,00:28:47,00:28:50,But a radio-controlled detonator...
447,00:28:52,00:28:53,"(quiet, rhythmic clicking) Are you hearing that?"
448,00:28:53,00:28:56,I switched the frequency.
449,00:28:56,00:29:00,I found this 18 yards from the van bomb.
450,00:29:00,00:29:05,"It's a servo switch, just like the one that operates this plane."
451,00:29:05,00:29:06,See?
452,00:29:08,00:29:14,It's clicking because it's searching for a signal from the radio controller and not finding one.
453,00:29:14,00:29:19,"I switched it back to ""A."" (whirrs) And we are back in business."
454,00:29:22,00:29:28,"So some guy's innocently flying this plane around, he flicks a switch and... he's a bomber?"
455,00:29:39,00:29:41,(heavy sigh)
456,00:29:46,00:29:48,Somebody please give me some good news.
457,00:29:48,00:29:49,That shiner'll go away in about a week.
458,00:29:49,00:29:55,"(groans) The last two bombs were radio-controlled, detonated by whoever was flying that model airplane around."
459,00:29:55,00:29:59,The better news is that Greg got a print off of it.
460,00:29:59,00:30:01,"Came back to an Alex McCann, 21."
461,00:30:01,00:30:02,Went through foster care.
462,00:30:02,00:30:06,"He's already in the system for B&amp;E, couple of petties."
463,00:30:06,00:30:09,"No address, but... WILLOWS: We got a McCann in custody-- a Jason McCann."
464,00:30:09,00:30:12,"Yeah, yeah, that was one of the people that I processed."
465,00:30:12,00:30:13,16 years old.
466,00:30:13,00:30:14,Could be a younger brother.
467,00:30:14,00:30:16,Certainly old enough to be involved.
468,00:30:16,00:30:22,"STOKES: Well, the owner of Hank's Hobby Shop said the kid that bought that plane fit Jason's description, so... So let me get my hooks into him."
469,00:30:22,00:30:26,"He's not gonna talk to you. Okay, well, are you gonna tell me how to do my job again?"
470,00:30:26,00:30:27,"We know how well that turned out, right?"
471,00:30:27,00:30:29,I'm gonna tell you how not to blow this.
472,00:30:29,00:30:31,"In case you haven't noticed, it's already blown."
473,00:30:31,00:30:35,"All right, let me go. What are you gonna do, Nick, give the kid a lollipop?"
474,00:30:35,00:30:36,It's the least I can do for Officer Clark.
475,00:30:36,00:30:38,"I mean, I owe him that much, don't you think?"
476,00:30:45,00:30:49,"Where's your gun, your vest, your badge?"
477,00:30:50,00:30:58,"You off work or something? Well, no, I only wear my vest when I'm in the field, and you can't really have your gun on in this room, and I'm not a cop, so I don't have a badge."
478,00:30:58,00:31:00,I just... have an I.D.
479,00:31:00,00:31:01,You still represent the authority.
480,00:31:01,00:31:04,Everything I hate.
481,00:31:04,00:31:06,Just like... you probably hate me.
482,00:31:06,00:31:11,"No, what I hate's got nothing to do with you, man."
483,00:31:11,00:31:16,"You know what I really hate right now, it's kind of eating me alive?"
484,00:31:16,00:31:23,"A few days ago, a police officer lost his life on my watch, 'cause I didn't have his back."
485,00:31:23,00:31:26,And he had a wife and two kids.
486,00:31:26,00:31:32,"When I went to the funeral to pay my respects, his family asked me to leave."
487,00:31:32,00:31:35,"I hated that, you know."
488,00:31:38,00:31:43,But I got involved in law enforcement because I want to try and help people.
489,00:31:43,00:31:46,"And that's the only reason I'm here, man, is trying to help you out."
490,00:31:46,00:31:49,Do you have a brother named Alex?
491,00:31:51,00:31:53,(sighs) Hm?
492,00:31:53,00:32:02,"Well, if you really love him and you don't want any more people to die, you need to go ahead and tell me where he is right now."
493,00:32:02,00:32:03,(sighs)
494,00:32:03,00:32:05,"They're gonna kill him, aren't they?"
495,00:32:05,00:32:07,Not if I can help it.
496,00:32:07,00:32:11,"I didn't have anything to do with the bombs, I swear."
497,00:32:11,00:32:13,I just bought the airplane. I believe you.
498,00:32:13,00:32:16,But what's the deal with your brother?
499,00:32:18,00:32:22,"When the cops arrested Ralph, Alex snapped."
500,00:32:22,00:32:24,Ralph was like a father to us.
501,00:32:24,00:32:27,He was a decent man.
502,00:32:27,00:32:29,And the cops treated him like a lowlife.
503,00:32:29,00:32:37,So your brother's waging war against the entire Las Vegas police force because of the way that Ralph was treated? He told me he was just gonna throw a scare in the cops.
504,00:32:37,00:32:44,"Not blow them up. Okay, look, all you're guilty of right now is buying a model airplane-- and that's not a crime, last time I checked."
505,00:32:44,00:32:48,"But it is a crime to make bombs and go around trying to kill people, like your brother's doing."
506,00:32:48,00:32:51,"So you got to go ahead and tell me where he is, Jason. I can't."
507,00:32:51,00:32:53,Why not?
508,00:32:53,00:33:00,"If you really want to protect him, you've got to help me get him into custody as soon as possible before somebody else gets hurt."
509,00:33:02,00:33:04,Where is he?
510,00:33:04,00:33:06,He's got a house in Old Henderson.
511,00:33:06,00:33:08,Where?
512,00:33:08,00:33:09,On Landon. Landon.
513,00:33:09,00:33:11,Good man.
514,00:33:11,00:33:12,You better hurry.
515,00:33:12,00:33:15,That show at the funeral was just fireworks compared to what's coming.
516,00:33:20,00:33:22,I don't see anybody inside.
517,00:33:31,00:33:35,"Okay, I've got to tell you, Nick-- that is a really bad idea."
518,00:33:35,00:33:39,"Well, I appreciate you having so much confidence in me, but ARMOR's still 20 minutes out, and according to that kid Jason..."
519,00:33:39,00:33:41,I get it. We don't have time.
520,00:33:41,00:33:44,But can we just make sure we don't blow us both up?
521,00:33:44,00:33:47,"That's a good idea, yeah."
522,00:34:04,00:34:06,Trip wire.
523,00:34:06,00:34:07,Seriously? Uh-huh.
524,00:34:12,00:34:14,There's no battery.
525,00:34:14,00:34:16,Okay.
526,00:34:16,00:34:17,We are in luck.
527,00:34:17,00:34:19,The circuit's not powered.
528,00:34:28,00:34:30,(door creaks)
529,00:34:37,00:34:40,"MONAHAN (on phone): Ray, we're inside."
530,00:34:55,00:34:59,"Okay, we've got nine empty bomb cases and a bowl of ice."
531,00:34:59,00:35:02,Ice means he hasn't been gone that long.
532,00:35:02,00:35:05,There's some white crystals here-- it looks like some meth.
533,00:35:05,00:35:06,Hold on.
534,00:35:08,00:35:09,(crackling)
535,00:35:09,00:35:10,Kacey?
536,00:35:10,00:35:11,MONAHAN: We're okay.
537,00:35:11,00:35:13,He's using TATP.
538,00:35:13,00:35:15,Triacetone triperoxide.
539,00:35:15,00:35:19,"You pack those pipes with it, it'll bring down a casino."
540,00:35:20,00:35:21,Tell me more about the ice.
541,00:35:21,00:35:25,"Well, you need a serious chill to precipitate the explosive but..."
542,00:35:25,00:35:28,looks like our boy didn't finish the job.
543,00:35:28,00:35:30,STOKES: Maybe this is the reason why.
544,00:35:30,00:35:32,Hydrochloric acid.
545,00:35:32,00:35:35,Final mixer in the TATP cocktail.
546,00:35:35,00:35:36,Bottle's empty.
547,00:35:36,00:35:38,Maybe Alex went shopping.
548,00:35:40,00:35:42,(blipping)
549,00:35:50,00:35:51,(alarm chirps twice)
550,00:35:51,00:35:53,(police siren whoops)
551,00:35:55,00:35:58,"Alex McCann, you're under arrest!"
552,00:35:58,00:36:01,"Get your hands in the air, get down on the ground."
553,00:36:02,00:36:04,Get down on the ground right now!
554,00:36:05,00:36:08,"Son, drop the bag and get down!"
555,00:36:10,00:36:12,"No... No, no, no!"
556,00:36:12,00:36:15,(shots firing)
557,00:36:20,00:36:21,"Nick, drop it."
558,00:36:21,00:36:23,Nicky! Huh?
559,00:36:23,00:36:25,Drop it. You all right? Yeah.
560,00:36:25,00:36:27,You all right? Huh? Yeah.
561,00:36:27,00:36:28,"OFFICER: Dispatch, this is Ida three-two."
562,00:36:28,00:36:30,We have a male suspect down.
563,00:36:30,00:36:32,Requesting EMS.
564,00:36:33,00:36:35,"DISPATCH (over radio): Ida three-two, copy that."
565,00:36:35,00:36:36,EMS has been notified.
566,00:37:05,00:37:06,He was planning to hit PD.
567,00:37:06,00:37:10,"Well, you just saved a lot of cops' lives."
568,00:37:10,00:37:12,(sighs)
569,00:37:12,00:37:17,"Next time Brass tries to beat you up, or you beat yourself up, remember that."
570,00:37:21,00:37:23,"Well, the bomber's dead."
571,00:37:23,00:37:25,That's one less wack job running loose in the world.
572,00:37:25,00:37:27,I call that a good day's work.
573,00:37:27,00:37:30,Where are we with our friends from the community center?
574,00:37:30,00:37:32,"Well, none of them had criminal records."
575,00:37:32,00:37:35,"Nothing ties them to the bombing, so I let them walk."
576,00:37:35,00:37:37,Except the younger brother. He had prior knowledge.
577,00:37:37,00:37:39,The D.A.'s going to want to talk to him.
578,00:37:50,00:37:52,"I didn't wake you, did I?"
579,00:37:52,00:37:53,(chuckles)
580,00:37:53,00:37:57,I brought you a little something.
581,00:37:57,00:37:58,Is it a tie?
582,00:38:00,00:38:01,Okay.
583,00:38:11,00:38:14,That's beautiful. Thank you.
584,00:38:14,00:38:16,You're going to be out of here in a few days.
585,00:38:16,00:38:18,It'll help you get back on your feet.
586,00:38:20,00:38:25,"When I lost my legs, I had to let go of some dreams."
587,00:38:25,00:38:30,I was never going to be Fred Astaire.
588,00:38:30,00:38:32,Lost a little off my jump shot.
589,00:38:32,00:38:37,But I still dance with my wife and shoot hoops once a week.
590,00:38:39,00:38:41,I'm never going to be a kidney donor.
591,00:38:41,00:38:43,Ray...
592,00:38:43,00:38:52,"no matter how much we think we can control in life, there's always going to be this much we have no control over."
593,00:38:52,00:38:55,"When you accept that, you can move on."
594,00:39:12,00:39:14,(sighs)
595,00:39:28,00:39:29,(phone beeps on)
596,00:39:34,00:39:36,I thought you went home.
597,00:39:36,00:39:37,"Oh, I'm trying."
598,00:39:37,00:39:41,I'm too tired.
599,00:39:41,00:39:44,(cell phone rings)
600,00:39:44,00:39:45,Where are we headed?
601,00:39:45,00:39:48,You're going home.
602,00:39:48,00:39:49,I'll take Greg.
603,00:39:49,00:39:51,(phone beeps off)
604,00:40:07,00:40:09,Hey. Hi.
605,00:40:09,00:40:10,"Where we headed, Andy?"
606,00:40:10,00:40:13,"Uh, just, uh, follow your noses."
607,00:40:15,00:40:18,SANDERS: Phew! Akers wasn't kidding.
608,00:40:18,00:40:21,"I smell urine, alcohol..."
609,00:40:21,00:40:23,"No decomp, though. This is recent."
610,00:40:23,00:40:27,"Caucasian male, between 30 and 50 years old."
611,00:40:27,00:40:29,It's hard to tell with these homeless guys.
612,00:40:29,00:40:32,"Somebody called it in about, uh, 20 minutes ago."
613,00:40:34,00:40:35,"You need some sleep, Lou."
614,00:40:35,00:40:37,Don't we all?
615,00:40:39,00:40:41,Blunt force trauma.
616,00:40:41,00:40:44,Looks like somebody dragged him.
617,00:40:44,00:40:47,There's a pup tent and some old bottles back there.
618,00:40:47,00:40:48,He might have been squatting.
619,00:40:48,00:40:49,Why don't you guys take the blood trail?
620,00:40:49,00:40:51,I'll take Mr. Aromatic.
621,00:40:55,00:40:59,"Every so often, a trash run? Kind of refreshing."
622,00:40:59,00:41:01,"That's the spirit, David."
623,00:41:13,00:41:15,SANDERS: Spatter.
624,00:41:15,00:41:16,Looks like we found our primary.
625,00:41:16,00:41:18,There's the tent.
626,00:41:18,00:41:20,(flashlight switch clicking)
627,00:41:20,00:41:21,Damn.
628,00:41:21,00:41:24,Do you have any extra batteries?
629,00:41:24,00:41:29,Why kill a guy and drag him into the middle of an empty room?
630,00:41:42,00:41:44,Thanks.
631,00:41:48,00:41:49,"David, wait."
632,00:41:53,00:41:56,Lou! Greg! Don't touch anything!
633,00:42:03,00:42:05,We're okay.
634,00:42:07,00:42:09,Thanks.
635,00:42:20,00:42:21,It isn't over.
