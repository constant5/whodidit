0	00:00:10	00:00:12	I am not ready for this.
1	00:00:12	00:00:14	Yeah, you are.
2	00:00:14	00:00:16	Besides, you got to be.
3	00:00:16	00:00:18	Dr. Ray's still on leave from the concussion.
4	00:00:18	00:00:19	We're all tapped out.
5	00:00:19	00:00:22	I got a multiple in Northtown.
6	00:00:22	00:00:24	Call me if you need anything, okay?
7	00:01:26	00:01:28	Damn it, Derrick, you're screwing up my one-to-ones.
8	00:01:28	00:01:29	Sorry.
9	00:01:29	00:01:32	This stuff is giving me the desire for pancakes.
10	00:01:32	00:01:35	Yeah, me, too. (laughter)
11	00:01:35	00:01:37	(groans) Kids.
12	00:01:37	00:01:46	Okay, crime cadets, this is serious crime-fighting business, so... back to being dead, please.
13	00:01:46	00:01:49	Excuse me, CSI Hodges?
14	00:01:49	00:01:50	Yes.
15	00:01:50	00:01:54	CSI Hodges, th-that's me. Katy Cypress. Nice to meet you.
16	00:01:54	00:01:58	Look, I know that this is just a program for wannabe CSIs.
17	00:01:58	00:02:02	And this exercise does test observational and evidence-collection skills.
18	00:02:02	00:02:05	Yes. Is it at least based on a real case?
19	00:02:05	00:02:07	No.
20	00:02:07	00:02:08	This is just brute-force rote work.
21	00:02:08	00:02:12	I couldn't agree with you more. The real fun is nailing bad guys.
22	00:02:12	00:02:16	And that's about interpreting the evidence and solving a real mystery.
23	00:02:16	00:02:19	That's what... you do, and that's what I want to do.
24	00:02:22	00:02:23	Okay.
25	00:02:23	00:02:24	I'll tell you what.
26	00:02:25	00:02:34	Let's finish up here, and then you grab a couple of your cadet buddies and meet me at the Crime Lab for a real challenge-- if you're up to it.
27	00:02:34	00:02:35	Oh, I am up to it.
28	00:02:35	00:02:36	Guillermo.
29	00:02:36	00:02:38	He'd love to do it.
30	00:02:38	00:02:40	He has no life.
31	00:02:40	00:02:43	I collect spores, molds and fungi.
32	00:02:43	00:02:45	You, too, Derrick-- it'll be fun.
33	00:02:50	00:02:52	Grab a seat.
34	00:02:56	00:02:58	Are we waiting on Derrick?
35	00:02:58	00:03:00	Uh, no. He's not coming.
36	00:03:00	00:03:02	He has video-game issues.
37	00:03:02	00:03:07	Ah. These files are from a case we investigated four months ago.
38	00:03:07	00:03:10	You said you wanted to match wits with real CSIs.
39	00:03:10	00:03:11	Now's your chance.
40	00:03:11	00:03:18	Among the many consequences of a construction boom are structures that are thrown together with little regard for building codes.
41	00:03:18	00:03:20	The fire department responded quickly.
42	00:03:20	00:03:26	But even so, the lower three levels of this apartment building were almost completely consumed.
43	00:03:26	00:03:33	The firemen, or, as we like to call them, the Evidence Eradication Crew, got the blaze under control.
44	00:03:33	00:03:38	But they were utterly unprepared for the astonishing sight waiting there to greet them.
45	00:03:39	00:03:40	Oh, boy, do I remember that one.
46	00:03:40	00:03:43	It was an incredible case.
47	00:03:43	00:03:46	I mean, like, you would never even believe it was possible unless you saw the evidence yourself.
48	00:03:46	00:03:49	Yeah, which is why I was about to show it to them.
49	00:03:49	00:03:51	Oh.
50	00:03:51	00:03:52	Hey. I'm Wendy.
51	00:03:52	00:03:54	And you are...?
52	00:03:54	00:03:55	Crime cadets.
53	00:03:55	00:03:56	Guillermo.
54	00:03:56	00:04:00	Could we see the body already, please?
55	00:04:00	00:04:01	Yeah. Okay.
56	00:04:01	00:04:02	Hey.
57	00:04:02	00:04:04	I tell it better than you.
58	00:04:04	00:04:08	Trust me, you guys are really gonna enjoy this.
59	00:04:08	00:04:16	What used to be the parking garage was filled with the contents of a dozen apartments, everything charred virtually beyond recognition...
60	00:04:16	00:04:20	with one incredible exception.
61	00:04:20	00:04:22	The CSIs had never seen anything like it.
62	00:04:22	00:04:24	I've never seen anything like it.
63	00:04:24	00:04:27	There's barely a mark on her.
64	00:04:27	00:04:35	Given the amount of available fuel consumed by this fire, I'd say we should be looking at a pile of roasted flesh and bone.
65	00:04:35	00:04:38	The body must have been put here after the fire was extinguished.
66	00:04:38	00:04:41	There were a dozen cops and two dozen firefighters on the scene.
67	00:04:41	00:04:48	The likelihood of anyone carrying a body into this and getting out unseen is... slim to none.
68	00:04:49	00:04:51	That's when I said...
69	00:04:51	00:04:54	It's as if... the fire refused to touch her.
70	00:04:54	00:04:55	Excuse me?
71	00:04:55	00:04:57	And then Wendy said...
72	00:04:59	00:05:04	The question is, is it miracle or murder?
73	00:05:08	00:05:11	Uh, please familiarize yourself with this evidence report.
74	00:05:14	00:05:17	That's what you're doing, you're lying to children?
75	00:05:17	00:05:18	It's a teaching exercise.
76	00:05:18	00:05:20	It's an exercise in self-love.
77	00:05:20	00:05:22	Just play along and be a role model, please?
78	00:05:22	00:05:25	Uh, no. Why would I play along with you?
79	00:05:25	00:05:30	Because if you can't even imagine yourself out in the field, how will you ever expect Ecklie to?
80	00:05:32	00:05:35	Okay, so there we were.
81	00:05:36	00:05:39	The question is, is it miracle...
82	00:05:39	00:05:40	or murder?
83	00:05:40	00:05:45	Either way, she tried as best as she could to survive.
84	00:05:49	00:05:52	Sounds like something I would say.
85	00:06:26	00:06:28	You look like you've dropped a few pounds there, Barclay.
86	00:06:28	00:06:29	You been working out or something?
87	00:06:29	00:06:31	Yeah, new diet.
88	00:06:31	00:06:33	No more donuts or sugary snacks, just-just pure protein.
89	00:06:33	00:06:34	All beef, all day.
90	00:06:35	00:06:36	Trading the diabetes for a heart attack.
91	00:06:36	00:06:38	(phone rings) Good call.
92	00:06:38	00:06:39	Yeah, what's up, Cath?
93	00:06:39	00:06:41	I'm in Mega-Lo-Mattress hell.
94	00:06:41	00:06:44	Found another DB in a quilt. I'll be here a while.
95	00:06:44	00:06:47	Oh, that's okay-- I just wrapped up my 419, I'll hold down the f... (man clears throat)
96	00:06:50	00:06:52	Nicky?
97	00:06:53	00:06:54	Oh, my God!
98	00:06:56	00:06:58	Nicky? You there?
99	00:06:58	00:07:00	Yeah, yeah, I'm here.
100	00:07:10	00:07:13	Yeah, it looks like I'm gonna be tied up for a little while longer here, Catherine.
101	00:07:14	00:07:15	Need paramedics and HazMat down to the squad.
102	00:07:18	00:07:19	Okay, I see it.
103	00:07:20	00:07:25	The concrete around the furnace is pitted and chipped, most likely from rapid thermal expansion.
104	00:07:25	00:07:26	It's called spalling.
105	00:07:26	00:07:29	Now, take a look at the vent pipes.
106	00:07:29	00:07:30	What do they tell you?
107	00:07:30	00:07:31	They're rusty.
108	00:07:31	00:07:34	And since fire is essentially a rapid oxidation reaction...
109	00:07:34	00:07:36	It means that the furnace is most likely where the fire started.
110	00:07:36	00:07:37	Very good.
111	00:07:37	00:07:38	This has got to be arson.
112	00:07:39	00:07:40	What makes you say that?
113	00:07:40	00:07:44	Most fires are either started because of insurance fraud or to cover up evidence of a crime.
114	00:07:44	00:07:46	And that certainly is a crime.
115	00:07:46	00:07:48	Were all the tenants accounted for?
116	00:07:48	00:07:50	And were any able to identify the victim?
117	00:07:50	00:07:52	Good questions...
118	00:07:52	00:07:53	for a detective.
119	00:07:58	00:08:00	So, all the tenants have been accounted for.
120	00:08:00	00:08:04	I showed her picture around, but, uh, no one recognized her.
121	00:08:05	00:08:07	Or so they say.
122	00:08:07	00:08:11	Thanks, Captain. We'll, uh, let you know what we come up with. (chuckles)
123	00:08:11	00:08:13	That's great.
124	00:08:13	00:08:17	You know what? Nobody gives a damn about life or death.
125	00:08:17	00:08:19	That's the truth. So why should I?
126	00:08:19	00:08:20	Why should you?
127	00:08:20	00:08:23	Do you know what the best thing to do is?
128	00:08:23	00:08:27	Is to just to go home...
129	00:08:27	00:08:30	and cuddle up with someone you love...
130	00:08:30	00:08:32	and just...
131	00:08:33	00:08:34	forget...
132	00:08:35	00:08:39	...just forget about all this-this...
133	00:08:39	00:08:41	madness.
134	00:08:43	00:08:46	But that would let them all off the hook, wouldn't it?
135	00:08:46	00:08:48	So, you know what I'm gonna do?
136	00:08:48	00:08:58	I'm gonna go home, I'm gonna get painted up, put on some Kevlar, go on a five-state shooting spree and take out these scumbags one at a time. Screw 'em.
137	00:08:58	00:09:06	And then let copper-jacketed justice take its sweet release.
138	00:09:10	00:09:12	Ooh, ouch.
139	00:09:12	00:09:13	(chuckles) What?
140	00:09:15	00:09:17	What?!
141	00:09:17	00:09:18	What the heck? No.
142	00:09:18	00:09:21	No, I'm not going to do that, all right?
143	00:09:23	00:09:24	No, I choose life.
144	00:09:26	00:09:28	Keep me apprised.
145	00:09:28	00:09:33	FYI, the alcoholism rate among police officers is double the national average.
146	00:09:33	00:09:34	Suicide rate's triple.
147	00:09:35	00:09:37	Hey, uh, wait a second.
148	00:09:37	00:09:39	That tub-- where's it from?
149	00:09:39	00:09:41	It's, uh, from apartment 2B, second floor.
150	00:09:42	00:09:45	Whose tenant just happened to be out of town right before the fire.
151	00:09:45	00:09:47	Does he have a record?
152	00:09:47	00:09:49	No, but he wasn't exactly a model citizen, either.
153	00:09:50	00:09:54	He'd had run-ins with the landlord before over illegal sublets. Okay.
154	00:09:54	00:09:56	Check this out...
155	00:09:56	00:10:00	off-the-books sublet girl was in the tub when the fire breaks out.
156	00:10:00	00:10:03	She dies of carbon monoxide poisoning, leaving no marks on the body.
157	00:10:03	00:10:09	She was still in the tub when the flames torched the floor and it all came tumbling down.
158	00:10:09	00:10:17	So, the bath oil on her skin acts like a shield long enough to protect her from the flames until she is discovered. That's not a bad theory.
159	00:10:17	00:10:18	And for a while, it was our theory.
160	00:10:18	00:10:20	It was also the wrong theory.
161	00:10:20	00:10:31	Most essential oils in bath gels have a flash point of under 250 degrees. With a fire that hot, it would've actually drawn the flames to her, not protect her. All right.
162	00:10:31	00:10:37	Well, since we know it's arson, if we identify the victim, it could lead us to the arsonist. Yeah.
163	00:10:37	00:10:39	What'd you get from Autopsy?
164	00:10:39	00:10:40	For that, you'll need a coroner.
165	00:10:40	00:10:44	And, uh, luckily, I happen to know where we can find one.
166	00:10:44	00:10:46	Take five.
167	00:10:47	00:10:49	Hey, Hodges. Oh, hey, Henry.
168	00:10:50	00:10:57	Yes? Remember that time you said that thing about your having a higher commitment to the lab and the pursuit of justice?
169	00:10:57	00:10:59	Yeah, I've probably said that more than once. Yeah, you have.
170	00:10:59	00:11:02	For the record, I find it admirable and Wendy does, too.
171	00:11:02	00:11:04	She does? Yeah.
172	00:11:04	00:11:07	We were chatting about it last weekend at the blood bank.
173	00:11:07	00:11:08	We donate together.
174	00:11:08	00:11:09	Oh.
175	00:11:09	00:11:10	No, B-positive.
176	00:11:10	00:11:13	Actually, Wendy and I have a lot in common.
177	00:11:13	00:11:21	We dabble in calligraphy, we're both passionate about French neoclassical architecture, and we are both allergic to eggplant.
178	00:11:21	00:11:30	Look, I was just thinking that I should ask her out on a date, and I assume that you'd be cool with that, due to your admirable commitment to the lab.
179	00:11:30	00:11:34	So are you cool with that?
180	00:11:36	00:11:38	Totally. Great.
181	00:11:38	00:11:41	Great, yes, see? That is awesome.
182	00:11:41	00:11:42	Thank you, you're a man of principle.
183	00:11:44	00:11:47	Uh, Wendy.
184	00:11:47	00:11:51	Hey. ANDREWS What's up? Good. How are you? Hi.
185	00:11:51	00:11:54	Um, I was wondering if you want to go out to eat tonight after work.
186	00:11:54	00:11:56	Yeah. Yeah? Okay.
187	00:11:56	00:11:58	All right, yeah, I'm just gonna... (Simms chuckling)
188	00:12:02	00:12:04	Attention, all personnel...
189	00:12:04	00:12:07	quarantine is still in effect until further notice.
190	00:12:07	00:12:10	Continue to observe all class-four protocol.
191	00:12:13	00:12:16	No anthrax, no ricin, no botulinum.
192	00:12:16	00:12:19	And no plague and no tularemia.
193	00:12:19	00:12:20	We're good, people.
194	00:12:20	00:12:22	Area's clear.
195	00:12:27	00:12:32	Well, if it's not in the air or a contact toxin, it has to be something they ate or drank.
196	00:12:33	00:12:38	Wouldn't be the first time a bunch of cops cheaped out on a dinner and ended up spewing out of both ends.
197	00:12:38	00:12:39	You're a CSI.
198	00:12:39	00:12:41	It's not your problem.
199	00:12:41	00:12:45	I think I'm making it mine tonight.
200	00:12:46	00:12:51	Have you encountered any cases recently with similar symptoms?
201	00:12:51	00:12:54	Projectile vomit, sweats, diarrhea?
202	00:12:54	00:12:56	I mean, it could be almost anything thing.
203	00:12:56	00:12:59	You know, there's a lot of stuff going around.
204	00:12:59	00:13:01	This town is a petri dish.
205	00:13:05	00:13:08	Hey, Jenkins...
206	00:13:08	00:13:10	how you doing? (moans)
207	00:13:10	00:13:13	I will get out of here in a second to let you get back to sleep.
208	00:13:13	00:13:18	But I need you to tell me everything you had to eat or drink today.
209	00:13:26	00:13:29	Uh, nurse?
210	00:13:30	00:13:36	Hey, kids, you know, a lot of people believe that all a coroner does is determine cause, manner, and time of death.
211	00:13:36	00:13:39	And in a case like this, there is so much more to discover.
212	00:13:39	00:13:42	All you have to do is look.
213	00:13:42	00:13:44	Her prints weren't in the system.
214	00:13:44	00:13:47	And no bodies matching her description were in missing persons.
215	00:13:47	00:13:49	The condition of her...
216	00:13:51	00:13:54	...area is consistent with recent sexual activity.
217	00:13:54	00:13:58	But her wet mount came back negative for, uh...
218	00:13:58	00:14:00	Semen? Thank you.
219	00:14:00	00:14:04	I believe this woman had Could we get to the C.O.D. please?
220	00:14:04	00:14:07	Not so fast.
221	00:14:07	00:14:08	You'll miss it.
222	00:14:08	00:14:18	The victim had plaque with numerous cavities, crowns made of white gold-- a substance not commonly used in the United States.
223	00:14:18	00:14:21	All of which led me to conclude that the victim was Russian...
224	00:14:21	00:14:22	Russian or Eastern European.
225	00:14:22	00:14:24	Obviously.
226	00:14:24	00:14:28	This is, uh, Vokovushka, the Russian Mighty Mouse.
227	00:14:28	00:14:30	Perhaps she was a tourist?
228	00:14:31	00:14:35	What are these glossy patches on her skin?
229	00:14:35	00:14:36	I-I don't know.
230	00:14:36	00:14:38	I sent samples to Trace.
231	00:14:38	00:14:39	Talk to Trace.
232	00:14:39	00:14:41	Actually, Trace loves to talk.
233	00:14:41	00:14:44	I'd suggest carving out a couple hours and taking snacks. C.O.D.?
234	00:14:44	00:14:46	Right.
235	00:14:47	00:14:49	There's no soot in the trachea.
236	00:14:52	00:14:54	Lung tissue color is normal.
237	00:15:01	00:15:04	There's no sign of carbon monoxide pink at all. (meowing)
238	00:15:05	00:15:07	Meow.
239	00:15:10	00:15:13	Hello, Morgue.
240	00:15:14	00:15:16	Of course. I'm always ready.
241	00:15:16	00:15:17	Right.
242	00:15:18	00:15:21	All right, the CSIs are on their way down.
243	00:15:21	00:15:24	She didn't inhale smoke.
244	00:15:24	00:15:26	Give me your notes. Give me your notes.
245	00:15:26	00:15:28	Get out!
246	00:15:30	00:15:36	You see, tox revealed a BAC of .30 with several benzodiazepine sedatives, along with zolpidem in her system.
247	00:15:37	00:15:38	Now, while the individual levels were sublethal...
248	00:15:38	00:15:40	The combination was...
249	00:15:40	00:15:42	Deadly. That's right.
250	00:15:42	00:15:44	C.O.D. was multiple drug overdose.
251	00:15:44	00:15:46	The victim was dead before the fire.
252	00:15:47	00:15:49	I was about to say that.
253	00:15:49	00:15:51	Too bad I said it first.
254	00:15:58	00:16:00	Here you go.
255	00:16:01	00:16:02	Now, we're starting off small.
256	00:16:02	00:16:06	This is only the stuff from the desks of the officers who actually got sick.
257	00:16:07	00:16:08	This is starting small?
258	00:16:08	00:16:10	Yep.
259	00:16:10	00:16:12	And you better get the GCMS fired up, boss.
260	00:16:12	00:16:14	Greg's bringing in vomit, blood and fecals.
261	00:16:18	00:16:20	Get it going.
262	00:16:22	00:16:34	In an arson investigation, after you find the area of origin, the next thing you look for is any sort of incendiary device, faulty wiring, flammable fluid-- basically any ignition source in the general vicinity.
263	00:16:35	00:16:36	Hey, Wendy.
264	00:16:36	00:16:38	Come take a look at this.
265	00:16:41	00:16:43	It's a natural gas line.
266	00:16:43	00:16:45	It's uncapped.
267	00:16:47	00:16:49	There's no tarnish on these tool marks.
268	00:16:49	00:16:51	This was done recently.
269	00:16:51	00:16:52	Yeah.
270	00:16:53	00:16:56	Did you find the gas cap at the scene?
271	00:16:58	00:16:59	Hodges. Hmm?
272	00:16:59	00:17:01	Uh, no.
273	00:17:01	00:17:03	And we sifted through a ton of char.
274	00:17:03	00:17:07	I'm sure you're still finding soot in places you don't want to talk about.
275	00:17:11	00:17:13	Well, no gas cap means no accident.
276	00:17:13	00:17:16	That proves that, uh, we're right about arson.
277	00:17:16	00:17:17	So it would seem.
278	00:17:20	00:17:25	We removed a section of the pipe to preserve the tool marks.
279	00:17:27	00:17:34	But what we didn't know was that this crime scene-- it very well could have been our last.
280	00:17:38	00:17:40	No!
281	00:17:51	00:17:56	Shortly thereafter, the city declared the building structurally unsound, and...
282	00:17:56	00:17:58	that was the last time CSI was allowed in.
283	00:18:00	00:18:01	He saved my life.
284	00:18:03	00:18:05	He saved the evidence, too.
285	00:18:11	00:18:13	You got to be kidding me.
286	00:18:13	00:18:15	What do you mean, the GCMS run isn't done yet?
287	00:18:15	00:18:16	It was supposed to be done an hour ago.
288	00:18:16	00:18:17	I don't know what's going on.
289	00:18:18	00:18:23	Well, I have a bunch of sick cops who need answers, and if you have to pull another shift to get it done, you're going to have to.
290	00:18:23	00:18:25	Let me look at this. (sighs)
291	00:18:25	00:18:29	Henry, the run cycle's been altered.
292	00:18:29	00:18:32	You set it to perform a cleaning and test cycle after each sample.
293	00:18:32	00:18:35	No, I didn't set it like that. I swear.
294	00:18:35	00:18:38	Well, maybe a power interruption could have reset it to a default.
295	00:18:38	00:18:40	There you go.
296	00:18:40	00:18:41	Problem solved.
297	00:18:41	00:18:42	You lucked out.
298	00:18:42	00:18:44	Yeah.
299	00:18:54	00:18:56	The uncapped gas line was the fuel.
300	00:18:56	00:18:59	What else do you need to make a fire?
301	00:18:59	00:19:00	A spark.
302	00:19:00	00:19:01	That's right.
303	00:19:01	00:19:05	And I've got a whole box full of sparks right over here.
304	00:19:05	00:19:07	Take a look.
305	00:19:13	00:19:18	According to this maintenance record, this breaker box was serviced the same day as the fire.
306	00:19:18	00:19:21	And it looks like the same company They do.
307	00:19:21	00:19:27	The police questioned the maintenance man, but the CSIs found this in his van.
308	00:19:29	00:19:30	The pipe cap?
309	00:19:31	00:19:33	The arsonist kept evidence of the crime on him?
310	00:19:33	00:19:35	Serial killers often keep souvenirs.
311	00:19:35	00:19:41	The maintenance man told the cops that he had gone to the apartment building to service the gas line and removed the cap, which had become corroded.
312	00:19:41	00:19:47	But when he returned to his van to find a replacement, he found he didn't have one, so he left.
313	00:19:47	00:19:49	He left the gas line uncapped?
314	00:19:49	00:19:50	He said he forgot.
315	00:19:50	00:19:58	He thought he closed the gas line completely, but he must have left a slow leak, which he didn't notice because he was losing his sense of smell-- or so he claimed.
316	00:19:58	00:19:59	His medical records confirmed that.
317	00:19:59	00:20:02	So, natural gas gradually filled the room...
318	00:20:02	00:20:05	Until there was enough, so that when the furnace clicked on...
319	00:20:07	00:20:08	Whoosh.
320	00:20:08	00:20:09	Indeed.
321	00:20:09	00:20:11	It was an accident.
322	00:20:11	00:20:14	Which means that it wasn't set to destroy the victim's body.
323	00:20:14	00:20:15	Our theory was completely wrong.
324	00:20:15	00:20:17	You said you wanted a challenge.
325	00:20:17	00:20:18	Wendy!
326	00:20:18	00:20:19	Hey. Hi.
327	00:20:19	00:20:21	Uh, I got great news.
328	00:20:21	00:20:26	I had to call in a couple of favors, but I got us a reservation at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.
329	00:20:26	00:20:27	It's, like, the best view in Vegas.
330	00:20:27	00:20:29	Wow.
331	00:20:29	00:20:35	That's cool, right? SIMMS a little more fancy-pants than the cop diner that I'd been picturing.
332	00:20:35	00:20:44	No. I, um... I was going to surprise you, but then I thought, you know, the gentlemanly thing to do would be to let you know, so you could dress appropriately for the occasion.
333	00:20:44	00:20:46	I'm going to go home on my lunch break and get my suit.
334	00:20:46	00:20:48	You're wearing a suit?
335	00:20:49	00:20:52	Ce sera parfaît.
336	00:20:53	00:20:57	It means, It will be perfect.
337	00:20:57	00:20:59	Um...
338	00:21:01	00:21:07	According to Henry, there were no drugs, poisons or toxins in any of the food or drink samples I collected.
339	00:21:07	00:21:09	We'll just have to test every consumable in the station.
340	00:21:09	00:21:11	It's shigella.
341	00:21:11	00:21:15	Positive? I called in a favor at the hospital's microbio lab.
342	00:21:15	00:21:18	We just did cultures on each of the sick unis.
343	00:21:18	00:21:19	They all have it.
344	00:21:19	00:21:22	Okay, well, shigella is food-borne.
345	00:21:22	00:21:25	It typically vectors through unsanitary handling practices.
346	00:21:25	00:21:28	Yeah, but something doesn't make sense.
347	00:21:28	00:21:31	According to what the unis told me between pukes... (man clears throat)
348	00:21:31	00:21:38	...none of them ate any of the same things today, so how did they all come down with the same bacterial infection?
349	00:21:38	00:21:41	I might be able to answer that. I'll call you back.
350	00:21:51	00:21:53	Hey, Nick. What's up?
351	00:21:53	00:21:54	Hold out your hands, Metcalf.
352	00:21:56	00:21:59	And, uh, don't touch me, please.
353	00:22:05	00:22:12	So, basically, we have an accidental fire and a victim whose body managed to remain unburned in it.
354	00:22:12	00:22:17	These patches on her skin, did you guys get anything useful from Trace?
355	00:22:17	00:22:19	You always get something from Trace.
356	00:22:37	00:22:39	CSI Hodges. Trace Tech Langston.
357	00:22:39	00:22:40	What do you have for me?
358	00:22:41	00:22:43	The question, CSI Hodges, is what don't I have for you?
359	00:22:43	00:22:49	I used, uh, polarized light microscopy to identify the glossy patches on your victim's skin.
360	00:22:49	00:22:54	And not to sound corny, but I think you'll find the results a-maize-ing.
361	00:22:56	00:22:58	Starch molecules.
362	00:22:59	00:23:00	Vaporized cornstarch, to be precise.
363	00:23:00	00:23:08	Did you know the word cornstarch is derived from the Middle English sterchen meaning to stiffen, which is apropos to the condition of your vic.
364	00:23:08	00:23:13	(laughs) Langston, the way that your rapier wit envelopes critical information, is just so...
365	00:23:13	00:23:15	Thrilling?
366	00:23:15	00:23:17	That's exactly what I was going to say.
367	00:23:17	00:23:20	Now, you say you derived these results from a simple polarized light test?
368	00:23:20	00:23:23	Lesser men would have resorted to using the GCMS.
369	00:23:23	00:23:26	Why use a sledgehammer to kill a fly?
370	00:23:26	00:23:27	I bow to the master. Nonsense.
371	00:23:27	00:23:29	You are great. I am great.
372	00:23:29	00:23:32	M-5. The Ultimate Computer.
373	00:23:32	00:23:33	Star Trek, the original series.
374	00:23:33	00:23:35	Is there any other?
375	00:23:35	00:23:37	It's like you're inside my head.
376	00:23:40	00:23:42	That Trace tech sounds kinda...
377	00:23:43	00:23:44	Obsequious.
378	00:23:45	00:23:46	Misunderstood.
379	00:23:47	00:23:50	You look concerned.
380	00:23:53	00:23:55	I am.
381	00:23:56	00:23:58	How does somebody get coated in vaporized cornstarch?
382	00:23:59	00:24:01	Body powder?
383	00:24:01	00:24:03	It's a health-conscious alternative to talc.
384	00:24:03	00:24:07	I doubt that powder would be thick enough to account for...
385	00:24:08	00:24:10	Peanuts.
386	00:24:10	00:24:11	Cornstarch peanuts.
387	00:24:11	00:24:13	Packing material.
388	00:24:13	00:24:17	She was killed and packed in the box with the peanuts.
389	00:24:17	00:24:22	The cardboard and the cornstarch acted as insulation, to protect the body from the flames.
390	00:24:22	00:24:29	Until the firemen arrived, blasting everything with their hoses, which separated her from whatever remained of the box.
391	00:24:30	00:24:31	Congratulations.
392	00:24:31	00:24:34	You have just matched wits with the CSIs.
393	00:24:34	00:24:35	Nicely done. Hmm!
394	00:24:35	00:24:37	Okay, so what's next?
395	00:24:37	00:24:40	Based on what we have here, nothing.
396	00:24:40	00:24:41	That's as far we got.
397	00:24:41	00:24:43	But we never ID'd the body.
398	00:24:43	00:24:44	Or the killer.
399	00:24:44	00:24:45	Neither did we.
400	00:24:45	00:24:48	What?
401	00:24:50	00:24:51	Yes.
402	00:24:51	00:24:56	But what doesn't suck is that yesterday, the city declared the building structurally sound.
403	00:24:56	00:25:04	So, after you have your parents fax me their written permission indemnifying the Crime Lab for any injuries you may sustain, we're going on a field trip.
404	00:25:04	00:25:06	So, my suit's done then?
405	00:25:06	00:25:08	Great. No, I'm on my way.
406	00:25:08	00:25:11	You didn't crease the pants though, did you, Mom?
407	00:25:11	00:25:13	'Cause there is nothing worse than...
408	00:25:13	00:25:15	(rattling, hissing) Huh?
409	00:25:15	00:25:17	Oh, no. No, no, no. I'll call you back.
410	00:25:17	00:25:19	No, no-no-no.
411	00:25:19	00:25:21	Not today.
412	00:25:23	00:25:25	What?
413	00:25:26	00:25:29	Ow.
414	00:25:33	00:25:35	Ah! No!
415	00:25:36	00:25:37	Car trouble?
416	00:25:38	00:25:39	Yeah, no kidding.
417	00:25:39	00:25:42	This ruins my whole lunch break, and I had things to do.
418	00:25:44	00:25:46	You know, Henry, maybe you should stay out of parking garages.
419	00:25:46	00:25:50	Bad things seem to happen to you there.
420	00:26:09	00:26:11	Henry?
421	00:26:11	00:26:16	Hmm? I don't mind taking time out of my day to check out your radiator hose, 'cause, clearly, it means a lot to you.
422	00:26:16	00:26:18	But you need to back off. You are ripe.
423	00:26:18	00:26:20	Sorry.
424	00:26:20	00:26:22	My car's been spending a lot of time in the shop.
425	00:26:22	00:26:25	I just wanted to know what's wrong before I take it in again.
426	00:26:25	00:26:27	Well...
427	00:26:27	00:26:29	I can tell you one thing.
428	00:26:29	00:26:30	This is not defective.
429	00:26:30	00:26:37	These holes are straight and uniform, which suggests they were mechanically introduced from the outside in.
430	00:26:38	00:26:40	Somebody poked my hose.
431	00:26:41	00:26:42	Sorry.
432	00:26:42	00:26:47	Sure, yeah, you could have a shady mechanic, but as far as car sabotage goes, this is amateur hour.
433	00:26:47	00:26:51	I mean, you really want to do some damage, you pop out a spark plug and throw rocks into the cylinder.
434	00:26:51	00:26:55	Radiator hose-- third grade stuff.
435	00:26:55	00:26:58	You been pissing off a lot of third graders lately?
436	00:26:59	00:27:01	Hodges! (groans)
437	00:27:03	00:27:08	You know, when you told me to join you for some fun, I really didn't realize it was going to be as wonderful as this.
438	00:27:08	00:27:13	As your humble tech, I would like to thank you very much for entrusting me with such an important job.
439	00:27:13	00:27:20	Listen, just remember to label all bindled evidence. Chain of custody is not just a suggestion, you know.
440	00:27:20	00:27:21	Don't push it, Hodges.
441	00:27:21	00:27:22	Okay. All right.
442	00:27:23	00:27:25	Hey.
443	00:27:26	00:27:27	Did I miss anything?
444	00:27:27	00:27:29	Thanks for texting me, K.
445	00:27:29	00:27:31	Sure, I mean, the team isn't the same without...
446	00:27:31	00:27:33	Oh!
447	00:27:34	00:27:36	Okay.
448	00:27:38	00:27:39	Oh. Yes.
449	00:27:41	00:27:44	(coughs) Fire scenes always smell this bad?
450	00:27:44	00:27:46	Yes.
451	00:27:47	00:27:51	Just let me know if you find anything that matches the burn pattern that we found earlier.
452	00:27:52	00:27:55	Why do you feel compelled to lie to us?
453	00:27:55	00:27:57	About what, exactly?
454	00:27:57	00:28:01	You don't have to be a real CSI to know that you and Hodges are not.
455	00:28:01	00:28:10	I suspect Hodges is a Trace tech, because I doubt any real CSI would wax so rhapsodic about that particular specialty.
456	00:28:11	00:28:15	And, clearly, that man does not relish being outdoors.
457	00:28:15	00:28:24	(splutters) That, and the fact that you two obviously spend an inordinate amount of time with each other, would suggest that you're most likely a lab tech, too.
458	00:28:25	00:28:27	I'm DNA.
459	00:28:27	00:28:28	So, why lie?
460	00:28:28	00:28:37	I guess I'm afraid that maybe I'm going to wake up one morning and I'm going to think that I spent most of life fighting crime in a test tube.
461	00:28:38	00:28:45	Just because something is the size of a molecule doesn't mean that it can't be filled with intrigue and excitement.
462	00:28:45	00:28:51	CSIs gather the evidence, but analysis is really what gives it meaning.
463	00:28:51	00:28:54	You need both to find the truth.
464	00:28:54	00:28:55	Found some crispy-ass denim.
465	00:28:58	00:29:00	They look like men's jeans.
466	00:29:05	00:29:07	A quarter and two pennies.
467	00:29:07	00:29:09	Dinner's on me.
468	00:29:13	00:29:14	Dead girl's a blonde, right?
469	00:29:18	00:29:22	That's her. Stacia Borsala.
470	00:29:22	00:29:23	Hungarian passport.
471	00:29:25	00:29:27	Looks like I've got what's left of a blister pack of...
472	00:29:27	00:29:28	Zolpidem.
473	00:29:28	00:29:33	This is so warped, I doubt I'm going to get any prints off of it. The victim had zolpidem in her system.
474	00:29:33	00:29:35	We did it.
475	00:29:35	00:29:36	We ID'd the vic.
476	00:29:36	00:29:38	I'm sorry, who?
477	00:29:39	00:29:41	In your face, CSIs. (laughter)
478	00:29:41	00:29:44	Techs and crime cadets, we rule.
479	00:29:44	00:29:45	Hello.
480	00:29:49	00:29:52	Metcalf doesn't have shigella on his hands.
481	00:29:52	00:29:54	Oh, that's surprising.
482	00:29:54	00:29:55	A bit of a relief, actually.
483	00:29:55	00:29:57	Yeah, but get this.
484	00:29:57	00:30:04	The bacteria that infected the squad room, turns out to be the same strain that closed down a day care center in Summerlin last week.
485	00:30:06	00:30:08	Hold on.
486	00:30:08	00:30:10	A day care center, huh?
487	00:30:10	00:30:12	Yep, half a dozen preschoolers.
488	00:30:12	00:30:13	Must've been quite a mess.
489	00:30:15	00:30:17	I don't think that's a coincidence.
490	00:30:17	00:30:21	The stuff that got 'em sick came from your pastry box.
491	00:30:21	00:30:24	What's the deal, bud? Hmm?
492	00:30:24	00:30:31	You get tired of the guys in the station stealing your food, so you thought you'd lace a few of your goodies with some shigella, teach 'em a lesson? No.
493	00:30:31	00:30:34	Yes, the guys steal my food, although those lowlifes would never admit it.
494	00:30:34	00:30:38	But, look, I would never...
495	00:30:38	00:30:40	Wh-What's shi-wha?
496	00:30:40	00:30:41	Shigella-- it's a bacteria, man.
497	00:30:41	00:30:43	Come on, now. Don't make this any harder on yourself.
498	00:30:43	00:30:46	What'd you do? Did you get the sample from your kid's day care center?
499	00:30:46	00:30:48	I don't know where the pastries came from, all right?
500	00:30:48	00:30:50	I stopped eating sugary snacks, remember?
501	00:30:50	00:30:53	Oh, and this isn't my kid's, it's my-my girlfriend's kid.
502	00:30:53	00:30:55	My-My ex-girlfriend, we just broke up.
503	00:30:55	00:30:57	But I got nothing against the kid.
504	00:30:57	00:30:58	You know, it's a good drawing, he's talented.
505	00:30:58	00:31:01	Was it a nasty break-up?
506	00:31:01	00:31:03	Is there a pretty kind?
507	00:31:03	00:31:06	Where can I find her?
508	00:31:06	00:31:15	So in revenge for breaking up with you, you decide to give Sergeant Barclay some delicious, homemade baked goods tainted with your child's shigella.
509	00:31:15	00:31:19	What did you do, save a diarrhea diaper and lace some in with the icing?
510	00:31:19	00:31:26	No. Well, what you didn't know was that Sarge had just gone on a little post-break-up diet.
511	00:31:26	00:31:30	Too bad for the cops who stole his food.
512	00:31:30	00:31:32	Your prints were on it.
513	00:31:32	00:31:37	It was a gift. I left it for Barky as a peace offering.
514	00:31:37	00:31:41	Without telling him? The worst you can do is have me reprimanded for bad hygiene.
515	00:31:41	00:31:43	You can't prove malicious intent.
516	00:31:43	00:31:45	That will be up to the D.A.
517	00:31:45	00:31:50	You caused a disruption at a police station, which could've cost lives.
518	00:31:50	00:31:52	You're looking at a class-B felony.
519	00:31:52	00:31:55	Would it help if I said I was really, really sorry?
520	00:32:00	00:32:05	I have to say I'm impressed with the initiative. I mean, this case had kind of fallen off the radar.
521	00:32:05	00:32:07	What made you follow up on it?
522	00:32:07	00:32:09	It was...
523	00:32:09	00:32:11	you know, for the children.
524	00:32:11	00:32:12	No, really, why?
525	00:32:12	00:32:14	I have sex stains right here.
526	00:32:16	00:32:17	Anything usable?
527	00:32:17	00:32:18	Maybe.
528	00:32:18	00:32:20	I'm going to try magnetic bead separation.
529	00:32:20	00:32:23	It works best for getting results from inhibited surfaces.
530	00:32:23	00:32:30	If the inhibited surface is a negative, then it needs a strong positive to draw it out.
531	00:32:30	00:32:37	Yeah, it also needs an outside agent to activate the... attraction.
532	00:32:37	00:32:41	Couldn't the outside agent contaminate the entire process?
533	00:32:41	00:32:43	No, it's not strong enough.
534	00:32:43	00:32:47	In fact, it's really only there to get things started.
535	00:32:47	00:32:48	Sounds like a delicate process.
536	00:32:48	00:32:53	Hmm, it is. One that requires a lot of patience.
537	00:32:53	00:32:57	It's worth it, because...
538	00:32:57	00:33:03	once the two are bound together, everything else is left behind.
539	00:33:05	00:33:07	Okay.
540	00:33:07	00:33:10	Let me know how it turns out.
541	00:33:16	00:33:20	Hey! I know what you're doing, and I know why you're doing it.
542	00:33:20	00:33:21	You're trying to ruin my date with Wendy.
543	00:33:22	00:33:23	Well, it's not gonna happen.
544	00:33:23	00:33:24	I followed protocol.
545	00:33:24	00:33:26	I asked you if it was cool, and you said yes.
546	00:33:26	00:33:31	Henry, I understand you're having a bad day, but I really don't see how I factor into any of it. Oh, fine, then I'll spell it out for you.
547	00:33:31	00:33:36	First, you monkeyed with my GCMS, and when that didn't work, you took it to the next level.
548	00:33:36	00:33:37	But that didn't work, either.
549	00:33:37	00:33:39	Our date is still on.
550	00:33:39	00:33:40	I hired a limo.
551	00:33:40	00:33:42	That's kind of flashy for a first date.
552	00:33:42	00:33:45	Stay out of my lab and stay out of my life, or else.
553	00:33:45	00:33:47	Or else what? Back off, man.
554	00:33:47	00:33:49	I'm a toxicologist.
555	00:33:49	00:33:53	I know every odorless, colorless, vomit-inducing liquid known to man.
556	00:33:53	00:33:56	You think about that the next time you eat lunch.
557	00:34:05	00:34:10	When the metal beads are added to a sample of the stain from the jeans, the DNA actually binds to sites on the metal.
558	00:34:10	00:34:15	And then in the magnetic field, the beads with the DNA are separated from the rest of the soup.
559	00:34:15	00:34:23	Now, this particular sample came back as a mixture, so we just subtract out the victim's profile.
560	00:34:23	00:34:25	And we get...
561	00:34:27	00:34:30	An unknown male. All we've got to do is match it to a tenant in the building.
562	00:34:30	00:34:33	You just made denim speak for the dead.
563	00:34:35	00:34:43	I'm sure you'll all be willing to give us a DNA sample to assist in our investigation. There's a bunch of other people whose apartments burned up.
564	00:34:43	00:34:45	Why are we the only ones here?
565	00:34:45	00:34:46	You just got lucky, I guess.
566	00:34:46	00:34:52	Fine, just show me the cup to pee in or take my blood or whatever, but I gotta be at my job in 20 minutes, so can we get this done?
567	00:34:52	00:34:54	That's the attitude. Let's go. All right.
568	00:34:57	00:35:01	Hey, uh, look, giving DNA to cops... uh...
569	00:35:01	00:35:06	The way I see it, that's an invasion of my privacy, so I'm going to decline.
570	00:35:06	00:35:07	You know, just on principle.
571	00:35:07	00:35:09	Sure, I respect your rights.
572	00:35:09	00:35:11	What's your name? Melvin Dodge.
573	00:35:11	00:35:13	Melvin Dodge.
574	00:35:13	00:35:15	Apartment 3C.
575	00:35:15	00:35:18	I just have a few things to follow up on, so why don't we have a chat?
576	00:35:18	00:35:19	Just you and me.
577	00:35:19	00:35:22	Okay, okay.
578	00:35:22	00:35:26	According to the landlord, you moved in three days before the fire.
579	00:35:26	00:35:27	Boy, that's a tough break.
580	00:35:27	00:35:29	Has the town been treating you any better since?
581	00:35:29	00:35:32	Yeah, I got a job dealing craps over at the Palermo.
582	00:35:32	00:35:34	They let me go, though.
583	00:35:34	00:35:35	Layoffs. There is a recession going on.
584	00:35:35	00:35:38	Maybe that's not the best time to move.
585	00:35:38	00:35:41	Three days before the fire, that's barely enough time to unpack.
586	00:35:41	00:35:45	Yeah, I was totally living out of boxes. Boxes?
587	00:35:45	00:35:47	You know what I hate about boxes?
588	00:35:47	00:35:50	The stuff they put in them-- the peanuts-- they get everywhere.
589	00:35:50	00:35:51	I learned something about them.
590	00:35:52	00:35:53	You know, they're not made out of Styrofoam.
591	00:35:53	00:35:56	To be friendly to the environment, they're made out of cornstarch.
592	00:35:56	00:36:01	They keep things from getting crushed, and also, keeps a dead girl from going up in flames.
593	00:36:01	00:36:04	Look, I can get your DNA in about ten seconds.
594	00:36:04	00:36:09	Tell me what happened right now, and maybe we can knock the charge down to involuntary manslaughter.
595	00:36:11	00:36:13	That's a break for you.
596	00:36:16	00:36:18	I didn't know she was going to die.
597	00:36:18	00:36:19	I met her at Haze.
598	00:36:19	00:36:21	She was new in town, too.
599	00:36:21	00:36:22	She didn't know anybody, either.
600	00:36:22	00:36:25	We started drinking. A lot.
601	00:36:25	00:36:27	She got flirty. She asked me if I had any drugs.
602	00:36:28	00:36:31	I told her I had zolpidem back at my place.
603	00:36:31	00:36:35	She starts talking about all the dirty things we can do if we popped a couple.
604	00:36:35	00:36:38	15 minutes later, she's doing things to me I've only seen online.
605	00:36:38	00:36:42	Then I woke up the next morning...
606	00:36:42	00:36:44	Babe?
607	00:36:44	00:36:45	And there she was. Hey, come on.
608	00:36:45	00:36:47	Hey, wake up. Dead.
609	00:36:47	00:36:49	I don't know what happened.
610	00:36:49	00:36:51	She said that she had done it before.
611	00:36:51	00:36:54	I guess I just wasn't thinking straight.
612	00:36:54	00:37:00	So you put her body in one of your boxes, figured you'd throw it in a Dumpster later?
613	00:37:00	00:37:02	Was that the plan?
614	00:37:02	00:37:04	I guess so.
615	00:37:04	00:37:10	But then, I got home that night and I saw that the whole place was going up in flames.
616	00:37:10	00:37:16	The fireman came up and he told me that my apartment had been completely destroyed.
617	00:37:16	00:37:19	I kind of felt like I got lucky again.
618	00:37:19	00:37:20	How do you feel now?
619	00:37:23	00:37:25	Let's do some writing.
620	00:37:27	00:37:30	This guy's life is totally over.
621	00:37:30	00:37:34	How do you deal with this day after day?
622	00:37:34	00:37:37	It's good work when you know you're on the right side.
623	00:37:44	00:37:46	Captain Brass?
624	00:37:46	00:37:50	I just want to say that I think it's awesome the way you've pulled your life back together.
625	00:37:50	00:37:53	Did you get into a program?
626	00:37:54	00:37:55	Who are you?
627	00:37:57	00:37:59	And what's he been telling you?
628	00:38:15	00:38:17	What?
629	00:38:18	00:38:20	Oh, come on...
630	00:38:22	00:38:23	Oh, no way.
631	00:38:23	00:38:26	This isn't funny!
632	00:38:29	00:38:31	What the...?!
633	00:38:37	00:38:39	Help. My face...
634	00:38:41	00:38:42	Help.
635	00:38:43	00:38:45	Lab tech down! Aah!
636	00:38:48	00:38:49	Wait, is that acetone?
637	00:38:49	00:38:50	Ah...
638	00:38:50	00:38:54	It is the best way to dissolve cyanoacrylate, Henry.
639	00:38:54	00:38:56	Yeah-- ah!
640	00:38:56	00:38:57	That's toxic.
641	00:38:57	00:39:03	Well, not so much, if you keep your mouth closed and cover your eyes with that.
642	00:39:03	00:39:07	Okay. Lucky for you, I was feeling better and decided to come to work today.
643	00:39:07	00:39:09	There's no telling how long you could've been stuck here.
644	00:39:10	00:39:21	Obviously, someone has not been adhering to lab policy against pranks, which is strange because we're usually such a cohesive group.
645	00:39:21	00:39:27	Please stop. I think it's a terrible injustice, because you...
646	00:39:28	00:39:32	...are the glue that holds this whole place together.
647	00:39:34	00:39:36	Let's see.
648	00:39:36	00:39:43	Mm-hmm. Looks like someone shimmed the lock, then applied contact adhesive to the interior surfaces of your locker.
649	00:39:44	00:39:46	Yeah, well, I have a very good idea who.
650	00:39:47	00:39:49	Stick it to him, Henry.
651	00:39:54	00:40:00	Hey. I saw you and Henry in the hall before... Look, I haven't been messing with Henry.
652	00:40:00	00:40:03	I'm not trying to spoil your date, and I hope that you guys have a very nice life together.
653	00:40:03	00:40:06	I really wasn't trying to blame you for anything.
654	00:40:06	00:40:09	I was just checking in.
655	00:40:11	00:40:13	Why are your hands in your pockets?
656	00:40:13	00:40:18	Because I'm socially awkward, and it gives me a sense of security.
657	00:40:26	00:40:33	You know, after Henry accused me, I began to suspect that someone was trying to pin their practical jokes on me.
658	00:40:33	00:40:43	So I mixed up a little something called detection spray and I put it all over the surfaces that I felt that Henry would be most vulnerable to pranks, including his locker.
659	00:40:43	00:40:51	It's essentially a ninhydrin solution, which goes on clear, then reacts with the amino salts in perspiration, leaving a stain on anyone who touches it.
660	00:40:51	00:40:57	And the more that the perp tries to wash it off, the more the stain spreads.
661	00:40:57	00:40:59	That's really fascinating. I should go.
662	00:40:59	00:41:00	It can last up to five days.
663	00:41:00	00:41:03	You may want to wear a dress with pockets tonight.
664	00:41:13	00:41:15	I'm not proud of this.
665	00:41:15	00:41:22	Then why did you do it? Because, originally, I really wanted to go out with Henry.
666	00:41:22	00:41:25	Because he's everything that I know I should be looking for.
667	00:41:25	00:41:33	He's adorable and charming and funny and sweet and nice to me... Okay, I get it.
668	00:41:33	00:41:39	He's peachy. But then, I realized that what I'm supposed to want...
669	00:41:39	00:41:42	isn't what I do want.
670	00:41:43	00:41:44	So...
671	00:41:44	00:41:51	basically, I did the mature thing and I tortured the poor guy with practical jokes all day, thinking that it might make him cancel the date.
672	00:41:51	00:41:54	That does sound like something I'd do.
673	00:41:54	00:41:59	All right, Hodges, Henry tells me that you reprogrammed the GCMS.
674	00:41:59	00:42:02	And glued my face to my locker and poked my hose.
675	00:42:02	00:42:05	Whatever. If this is true, you're looking at a formal reprimand and days off. Did you do it?
676	00:42:05	00:42:07	Can I just say something?
677	00:42:08	00:42:10	I am so sorry...
678	00:42:10	00:42:12	That you didn't stop me earlier.
679	00:42:12	00:42:17	You see, Wendy suspected what I was up to, and she was urging me to come clean.
680	00:42:17	00:42:20	I swear, it'll never happen again.
681	00:42:20	00:42:21	Mea culpa.
682	00:42:22	00:42:24	Can you forgive me?
683	00:42:26	00:42:28	This is going to go on your permanent record.
684	00:42:28	00:42:31	You got your confession-- happy?
685	00:42:31	00:42:32	Hmm.
686	00:42:32	00:42:35	Nobody likes a snitch.
687	00:42:43	00:42:47	Henry, I am so, so sorry.
688	00:42:47	00:42:48	I guess this means our date's off?
689	00:42:48	00:42:51	Oh, yeah.
690	00:42:51	00:42:55	I guess I need some time for my face to heal!
691	00:42:56	00:42:58	Can I get a rain check?
692	00:43:04	00:43:05	Mmm!
693	00:43:11	00:43:13	It's never going to happen.
