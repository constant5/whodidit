1,00:00:04,00:00:06,(women cheering)
2,00:00:06,00:00:07,(cork pops)
3,00:00:07,00:00:08,Whoo!
4,00:00:08,00:00:10,(laughter)
5,00:00:14,00:00:16,"Slam it, slam it!"
6,00:00:16,00:00:17,Whoo!
7,00:00:17,00:00:22,"Okay, 39 hours and you're an old married bitch!"
8,00:00:22,00:00:23,(all yelling)
9,00:00:24,00:00:27,I'm not married yet and you're the bitch!
10,00:00:27,00:00:31,"Whoo! No, n-no, n-no, you're driving, I'm drinking."
11,00:00:31,00:00:32,"Brenda, flash the trucker."
12,00:00:32,00:00:35,"Flash the trucker, flash the trucker!"
13,00:00:35,00:00:38,"Flash the trucker, flash him!"
14,00:00:38,00:00:39,(all whooping and chattering)
15,00:00:44,00:00:46,(horn honking)
16,00:00:46,00:00:47,Uh-oh!
17,00:00:47,00:00:49,(laughter and cheering)
18,00:00:53,00:00:55,(horn blowing)
19,00:00:56,00:00:57,(shouting)
20,00:00:57,00:00:59,(laughter and cheering)
21,00:00:59,00:01:00,"Hey, yo, there's a car!"
22,00:01:02,00:01:04,(tires screeching)
23,00:01:04,00:01:05,(screaming)
24,00:01:15,00:01:18,"STOKES: Look, sir, it's just standard operating procedure."
25,00:01:18,00:01:24,"TRUCKER: Hey, I told you I wasn't drinking, but those girls, they must have been on something."
26,00:01:26,00:01:27,What about the pedestrian that was hit?
27,00:01:27,00:01:28,Did you see where she came from?
28,00:01:28,00:01:31,I didn't see her till she was on the ground.
29,00:01:31,00:01:32,Girls were screaming.
30,00:01:32,00:01:33,I'm the one that called 911.
31,00:01:33,00:01:35,LANGSTON: Thank you.
32,00:01:35,00:01:36,"OFFICER: All right, calm down."
33,00:01:36,00:01:38,Tell me what happened before you hit that lady.
34,00:01:38,00:01:39,WOMAN: We didn't hit her.
35,00:01:39,00:01:40,She hit us.
36,00:01:40,00:01:42,"Shut up, Claire."
37,00:01:42,00:01:44,You girls been drinking tonight?
38,00:01:44,00:01:46,Is that woman going to die?
39,00:01:46,00:01:47,I don't know.
40,00:01:47,00:01:49,Which one of you was driving?
41,00:01:49,00:01:54,"All right, Mitch, Breathalyzers and sobriety tests times three."
42,00:01:54,00:01:55,Got you. But I'm getting married this weekend.
43,00:01:55,00:01:58,"And if he loves you, he'll wait."
44,00:01:58,00:02:01,Julie was driving. Julie?
45,00:02:01,00:02:04,I'm not going to miss my wedding for you.
46,00:02:04,00:02:05,(vomits)
47,00:02:07,00:02:10,You got a whole desert here.
48,00:02:11,00:02:14,"LANGSTON: Hey, Nick, what do you got?"
49,00:02:14,00:02:17,Why can't people just wait till they get to Vegas to start partying?
50,00:02:17,00:02:18,Is that so difficult?
51,00:02:18,00:02:19,"Well, it is for some people."
52,00:02:19,00:02:22,"You know what they say-- beer before wine, you'll be fine."
53,00:02:22,00:02:24,"Yeah, wine after liquor, never sicker."
54,00:02:24,00:02:26,Hmm. Which is probably the case here.
55,00:02:26,00:02:29,"Right front tire is flat and as you can see, this front bumper is just shredded."
56,00:02:29,00:02:31,"Yeah, that looks like the point of impact."
57,00:02:31,00:02:33,Paramedic said he found the victim over there.
58,00:02:33,00:02:38,I'm still trying to figure out what she was doing out here all by herself in the middle of nowhere.
59,00:02:41,00:02:43,(monitor beeping)
60,00:02:49,00:02:53,"We moved her from critical to stable, but it's going to be a while before you can talk to her."
61,00:02:54,00:02:56,"Okay, thank you. Okay."
62,00:02:57,00:02:59,"Hey, Jim. Hey."
63,00:02:59,00:03:01,Greg found an abandoned vehicle about a mile from the scene.
64,00:03:01,00:03:03,It could be the victim's.
65,00:03:03,00:03:05,"Keys and wallet were under the seat, Nevada license."
66,00:03:05,00:03:09,Her name is Janet Marie Marsh.
67,00:03:09,00:03:11,She lives in Seven Hills.
68,00:03:11,00:03:13,She's a friend.
69,00:03:15,00:03:20,"About three years ago, her husband and two kids went missing."
70,00:03:20,00:03:24,We found his abandoned SUV with blood inside on the I-15.
71,00:03:24,00:03:28,She was hit near mile marker 41.
72,00:03:28,00:03:30,It's the same stretch of road.
73,00:03:31,00:03:33,She lost her whole family.
74,00:03:33,00:03:35,She was looking for them.
75,00:03:36,00:03:39,She's looking for ghosts.
76,00:04:12,00:04:16,BRASS:There's always a case that just won't let you go.
77,00:04:16,00:04:18,I carried this around in my wallet for three years.
78,00:04:18,00:04:25,"This is the husband, Mike Marsh, and the two kids-- that's Andy, age nine, and Emily, age 15."
79,00:04:25,00:04:27,"Hmm, how did it all go down?"
80,00:04:27,00:04:30,"Well, Janet got out of work a little after midnight."
81,00:04:30,00:04:33,"Comes home, nobody's there, you know."
82,00:04:33,00:04:35,"So she calls her husband, she calls her daughter-- no answer."
83,00:04:35,00:04:38,"She, uh, calls her brother who lives nearby."
84,00:04:38,00:04:41,"He doesn't know anything about it, so calls the hospital and then she calls us."
85,00:04:41,00:04:42,We put out a broadcast.
86,00:04:42,00:04:48,"Around 6:00 a.m., Highway Patrol found an abandoned SUV on I-15 North."
87,00:04:48,00:04:54,Inside we find the husband and the daughter's blood in the backseat and a bloody pajama top of the young boy.
88,00:04:54,00:04:59,"Not enough blood to confirm death, but it was certainly enough to suspect serious injury."
89,00:04:59,00:05:01,That's all the evidence we recovered.
90,00:05:01,00:05:03,Case went cold.
91,00:05:03,00:05:06,And she just keeps going back out to the crime scene?
92,00:05:07,00:05:08,Yeah.
93,00:05:14,00:05:16,(camera shutter clicks)
94,00:05:16,00:05:23,"You know, I usually work scenes like this solo-- deserted stretches of highway, nothing around but coyotes."
95,00:05:23,00:05:27,"I used to consider it punishment, but now I enjoy the quiet."
96,00:05:27,00:05:28,(sighs)
97,00:05:28,00:05:30,I can leave if you like.
98,00:05:30,00:05:31,(both chuckle)
99,00:05:33,00:05:37,Looks like the convertible bottomed out here.
100,00:05:37,00:05:42,"Yeah, this dip probably caused the car to bleed off a lot of speed."
101,00:05:42,00:05:44,It's probably why the victim is still alive.
102,00:05:46,00:05:48,Something in the bushes.
103,00:05:56,00:05:58,I got a flashlight...
104,00:05:59,00:06:02,with what appears to be fresh blood on the grip.
105,00:06:04,00:06:06,Could've belonged to the victim.
106,00:06:06,00:06:09,And you didn't have any suspects?
107,00:06:09,00:06:10,I kinda liked the brother.
108,00:06:10,00:06:12,Name is Bill Cornwell.
109,00:06:12,00:06:13,He has a construction business.
110,00:06:13,00:06:16,He was in partnership with Mike Marsh.
111,00:06:16,00:06:18,"There's a lot of debt, a lot of insurance."
112,00:06:18,00:06:20,"That's motive right there, Jim."
113,00:06:20,00:06:22,"We brought him in, we interrogated him, you know?"
114,00:06:22,00:06:24,He didn't give me a straight answer. He was very cagey.
115,00:06:24,00:06:26,I just didn't like his face. I felt he was lying.
116,00:06:26,00:06:28,But he had an airtight alibi.
117,00:06:28,00:06:30,"DOCTOR: Captain, she has a concussion."
118,00:06:30,00:06:32,Her left ulna's fractured in two different places.
119,00:06:32,00:06:33,There's no internal bleeding.
120,00:06:33,00:06:36,She got lucky. I'm going to keep her under observation for a few more hours.
121,00:06:36,00:06:37,"That's great news. Thank you, Doctor."
122,00:06:37,00:06:39,Okay. Thanks for your help.
123,00:06:39,00:06:40,Thanks. Mm-hmm.
124,00:06:40,00:06:42,Would you mind if I just...?
125,00:06:42,00:06:43,"Give me a minute? No, please."
126,00:06:43,00:06:46,Thanks. Go ahead.
127,00:06:47,00:06:50,(monitor beeping rhythmically)
128,00:06:51,00:06:53,I thought we had a deal.
129,00:06:54,00:06:58,No more moonlight hikes.
130,00:06:58,00:06:59,What happened out there?
131,00:06:59,00:07:02,How are the girls?
132,00:07:03,00:07:04,Did their parents get notified?
133,00:07:04,00:07:07,"Come on, Detective. Don't do my job for me."
134,00:07:07,00:07:08,Okay.
135,00:07:08,00:07:09,(knocking on door)
136,00:07:09,00:07:12,This is CSI Nick Stokes.
137,00:07:12,00:07:15,"He's got to do a little work, okay?"
138,00:07:15,00:07:19,"Mrs. Marsh, I'm here to, um, document your injuries and collect your clothing, okay?"
139,00:07:19,00:07:23,"Janet, they're gonna release you in about two hours."
140,00:07:23,00:07:25,"I'm gonna come back and give you a ride home, okay?"
141,00:07:29,00:07:30,Ooh!
142,00:07:30,00:07:30,(groans)
143,00:07:31,00:07:33,How many stitches did they give you?
144,00:07:33,00:07:35,You're wasting your time.
145,00:07:35,00:07:37,I'm not going to press charges.
146,00:07:37,00:07:41,"Well, that's up to the D.A., but I'll put it in my report."
147,00:07:41,00:07:43,"Jim told you all about me, didn't he?"
148,00:07:43,00:07:49,I can tell by the look in your eyes you pity the poor crazy lady who lost her family.
149,00:07:49,00:07:51,No.
150,00:07:51,00:07:53,"Yes. No, I don't."
151,00:07:53,00:07:55,"Listen, I don't pity you."
152,00:07:55,00:07:58,"Honestly, I completely understand."
153,00:07:58,00:08:03,"If I lost my whole family like that, I would never stop looking for them until I got some answers."
154,00:08:04,00:08:07,No matter what.
155,00:08:07,00:08:11,Can you remember anything about the car accident?
156,00:08:11,00:08:13,"BOY (low and distant): Mommy, Mommy, I'm here!"
157,00:08:13,00:08:15,He was calling me.
158,00:08:16,00:08:17,"BOY: Mommy, Mommy, I'm here!"
159,00:08:18,00:08:19,"Mommy, I'm here!"
160,00:08:22,00:08:24,(women screaming)
161,00:08:28,00:08:31,Sometimes I get lost in my thoughts.
162,00:08:31,00:08:32,Is that what happened last night?
163,00:08:32,00:08:33,You got lost in your thoughts?
164,00:08:33,00:08:40,No. I was out following a lead on the case.
165,00:08:40,00:08:42,And did you tell Captain Brass about that lead?
166,00:08:42,00:08:44,Uh-uh.
167,00:08:44,00:08:46,Because the lead came from a psychic.
168,00:08:46,00:08:50,A reputable one who's worked with the LAPD.
169,00:08:50,00:08:52,Jim thinks it's all hocus-pocus.
170,00:08:52,00:08:54,"You probably do, too."
171,00:08:54,00:08:57,"(chuckles): No, ma'am. I've learned to keep an open mind."
172,00:08:58,00:09:01,"This job will do that to you, you know?"
173,00:09:03,00:09:06,This psychic...
174,00:09:06,00:09:10,"she's sure that Andy is dry, yet near water."
175,00:09:10,00:09:14,Did you know that Vegas is built on some underground springs?
176,00:09:14,00:09:15,Yeah.
177,00:09:15,00:09:16,"Well, I got a map."
178,00:09:16,00:09:21,And there's a spring in the desert right under where they found Mike's Jeep.
179,00:09:21,00:09:24,"See-- dry, yet near water."
180,00:09:24,00:09:25,"Mommy, Mommy, help me."
181,00:09:26,00:09:27,Help me!
182,00:09:27,00:09:28,"Mommy, please..."
183,00:09:28,00:09:29,Please help me.
184,00:09:30,00:09:31,(voice breaking): Andy's so close.
185,00:09:33,00:09:35,He wants me to find him.
186,00:09:35,00:09:37,I feel him all around me still.
187,00:09:37,00:09:38,(sobs)
188,00:09:41,00:09:44,What about your husband and your daughter?
189,00:09:47,00:09:49,Never.
190,00:09:50,00:09:51,Isn't that terrible?
191,00:09:51,00:09:52,No.
192,00:09:58,00:10:00,"(computer trilling, beeping)"
193,00:10:23,00:10:26,"(computer trilling, beeping)"
194,00:10:28,00:10:29,"Hey, Greg."
195,00:10:29,00:10:31,you gotta come take a look at this.
196,00:10:33,00:10:39,"I was just processing the fresh blood from the grip, and I noticed old blood and tissue in this ring around the lens."
197,00:10:39,00:10:41,Old blood? Yeah.
198,00:10:41,00:10:43,So it can't be casual transfer from the vic.
199,00:10:43,00:10:45,Has to be from an earlier event.
200,00:10:45,00:10:47,Right.
201,00:10:47,00:10:50,And that impact had to be significant enough to actually damage tissue.
202,00:10:50,00:10:56,"Plus those are hair fragments right there, which tells me that somebody was whacked on the head."
203,00:11:02,00:11:08,"So, uh, Wendy got a hit on the blood and tissue from Janet Marsh's flashlight."
204,00:11:08,00:11:11,Familial match to her son Andy.
205,00:11:11,00:11:14,We could be looking at our murder weapon.
206,00:11:14,00:11:19,So this woman's been searching for her son all these years with the exact same flashlight that was used to kill him?
207,00:11:19,00:11:23,"If Janet Marsh was in possession of the murder weapon, that makes her the only suspect."
208,00:11:23,00:11:24,Wait a minute now.
209,00:11:24,00:11:26,I've met the woman.
210,00:11:26,00:11:28,It's very tough to fake grief like that.
211,00:11:28,00:11:30,"Well, guilt can masquerade as grief."
212,00:11:30,00:11:35,And there's a lot of people who express remorse after committing a homicide.
213,00:11:35,00:11:43,"If this were the father that we were talking about and not the mother, what would we be thinking then?"
214,00:11:43,00:11:44,"""Lock him up""?"
215,00:11:44,00:11:48,"And, ordinarily, we'd be right, but this is by no means an ordinary case."
216,00:11:53,00:11:55,(knocking on door)
217,00:11:56,00:11:58,"Hi. How you feeling, Janet?"
218,00:11:58,00:11:59,Better?
219,00:11:59,00:12:00,I'm okay.
220,00:12:00,00:12:01,Good.
221,00:12:01,00:12:04,"So, what brings you here?"
222,00:12:04,00:12:05,We found some new evidence.
223,00:12:05,00:12:06,It concerns Andy.
224,00:12:06,00:12:07,You found my son?
225,00:12:07,00:12:11,"Uh, no, ma'am, but with your help, we may be able to."
226,00:12:11,00:12:13,Okay.
227,00:12:13,00:12:15,Come on in.
228,00:12:33,00:12:34,"So, what can I do?"
229,00:12:34,00:12:35,How can I help?
230,00:12:35,00:12:37,You had a flashlight with you last night.
231,00:12:37,00:12:38,Yes.
232,00:12:38,00:12:39,Where did you get that?
233,00:12:40,00:12:41,It was in the car.
234,00:12:41,00:12:43,"Okay, so it's yours. Yes."
235,00:12:43,00:12:46,"Oh. And where do you keep that, in the car?"
236,00:12:46,00:12:48,In the kitchen. How long have had the flashlight?
237,00:12:48,00:12:50,"Uh, ten years."
238,00:12:50,00:12:52,Since we bought the house.
239,00:12:52,00:12:54,(chuckles) Why are they asking about the flashlight?
240,00:12:54,00:12:57,We found Andy's blood on it.
241,00:12:59,00:13:01,"Well, how can that be?"
242,00:13:01,00:13:04,You all searched the house already.
243,00:13:05,00:13:08,"When we searched Mike's Jeep, that became our crime scene."
244,00:13:08,00:13:11,"Mrs. Marsh, we'd like permission to process your house."
245,00:13:11,00:13:13,Of course.
246,00:13:13,00:13:15,Kitchen's that way.
247,00:13:18,00:13:20,"MAN (over radio): Control, 257 Adam, copy."
248,00:13:20,00:13:21,Responding at three.
249,00:13:21,00:13:23,"WOMAN: 252 Boy, Control."
250,00:13:23,00:13:26,Respond to a 417 at 273 Adams Street.
251,00:13:26,00:13:28,Informant will meet you in front of the house.
252,00:13:30,00:13:31,(scoffs)
253,00:13:31,00:13:34,When did you get the police scanner?
254,00:13:34,00:13:37,"Oh, I hardly listen to that thing anymore."
255,00:13:37,00:13:40,It's in the kitchen.
256,00:13:40,00:13:42,Yeah. Let-let me show you where I keep the...
257,00:13:42,00:13:46,"No, no. You can just point it out for me, if you don't mind."
258,00:13:46,00:13:49,I keep it in the last drawer.
259,00:13:50,00:13:52,(indistinct radio transmission)
260,00:13:52,00:13:54,"Come on, Janet. I'll buy you lunch."
261,00:13:59,00:14:03,"All right, I got a police report here with a supplemental in Brass' handwriting."
262,00:14:03,00:14:08,Time cards substantiate that Janet Marsh was working at Wellington's Market from 4:00 p.m.
263,00:14:08,00:14:10,to midnight the night her family went missing.
264,00:14:11,00:14:12,She had an alibi.
265,00:14:12,00:14:16,But she didn't call 911 until almost 4:00 a.m.
266,00:14:16,00:14:26,"Which would've given Janet Marsh time to kill her family, to clean up, to dispose of the bodies and to dump the bloody truck, which gave her a diversion and took us 23 miles away from the house."
267,00:14:27,00:14:28,That's a lot for one person to do.
268,00:14:29,00:14:32,"So, if she did it, she had to have help."
269,00:14:36,00:14:40,"If a stranger committed these murders, he would've brought his own weapon."
270,00:14:40,00:14:46,"And if he didn't, he would've done a quick search of the room and grabbed one of these knives."
271,00:14:46,00:14:49,Why would he pick a flashlight?
272,00:14:49,00:14:51,And why put it back in the drawer?
273,00:14:51,00:14:54,Maybe force of habit.
274,00:14:54,00:14:57,Or the killer thought he cleaned it off and put it back where it belonged.
275,00:14:57,00:15:00,"Either way, it suggests we're looking at a family member or a friend."
276,00:15:00,00:15:03,Janet admitted to Brass that her marriage was rocky.
277,00:15:04,00:15:06,A lot of marriages end because of infidelity.
278,00:15:06,00:15:07,Maybe she was seeing someone.
279,00:15:07,00:15:08,Brass checked her phone records.
280,00:15:09,00:15:10,There was no unusual calls.
281,00:15:10,00:15:13,Looks like she talked to her brother at least twice a day.
282,00:15:13,00:15:19,"Let's say Janet snapped, killed her family, calls brother Bill."
283,00:15:19,00:15:20,He helps her cover it up.
284,00:15:20,00:15:24,"Well, Brass' gut told him that the brother was involved, but the guy had a ironclad alibi."
285,00:15:24,00:15:27,He was questioned a dozen times.
286,00:15:27,00:15:30,"Searched his home, his office, his car."
287,00:15:30,00:15:34,"Still, Janet told Nick that she had hallucinations about her dead son."
288,00:15:34,00:15:37,It sounds like she was experiencing some kind of dissociative episode.
289,00:15:37,00:15:41,Her personality splintered because of the guilt.
290,00:15:41,00:15:43,This is why she wanders the highway at night.
291,00:15:43,00:15:45,She's being tormented by her own conscience.
292,00:15:45,00:15:51,Or she's a cold-blooded murderer who's still playing out her diversion to keep the suspicion away.
293,00:17:21,00:17:23,"Hey, check this out."
294,00:17:23,00:17:26,This is the latest issue of this magazine.
295,00:17:26,00:17:29,Janet Marsh never canceled her son's subscription.
296,00:17:29,00:17:33,You know. it looks to me like she just quit living the night her family disappeared.
297,00:17:33,00:17:37,And she's not going to live again until she gets some answers.
298,00:17:37,00:17:39,What's that?
299,00:17:39,00:17:41,Her daughter had a diary.
300,00:17:41,00:17:43,Listen to this.
301,00:17:43,00:17:46,"""He gave me the coolest bracelet today ""and told me how special I am."
302,00:17:46,00:17:53,"""He's the only one who understands me, ""especially since my mom only cares about Andy, ""and my dad's never home."
303,00:17:53,00:18:02,"""I love him, and I wish he could take me away from here. Maybe someday."" Did Brass interview the boyfriend?"
304,00:18:02,00:18:03,Brass never mentioned a boyfriend.
305,00:18:03,00:18:08,"Well, this is the last entry, five months before her disappearance."
306,00:18:08,00:18:12,"She wrote in this journal every day for a year, and then just stopped."
307,00:18:12,00:18:16,"There must have been something going on, especially at that age."
308,00:18:16,00:18:18,Maybe a significant event with a significant other?
309,00:18:18,00:18:21,A boyfriend could've known his way around the house.
310,00:18:21,00:18:23,What's his name? We'll have Brass round him up.
311,00:18:23,00:18:24,She doesn't even mention his name.
312,00:18:24,00:18:26,Not even an initial.
313,00:18:26,00:18:29,"Ah, that's weird."
314,00:18:29,00:18:31,Maybe it was someone her parents didn't approve of.
315,00:18:35,00:18:37,"You think they're dead, don't you?"
316,00:18:37,00:18:44,It's just that I always had this feeling that somehow Andy got away.
317,00:18:45,00:18:47,What about your daughter?
318,00:18:47,00:18:49,Could you ever give up on Ellie?
319,00:18:49,00:18:51,(children giggling)
320,00:18:54,00:18:57,"Actually, I think in some ways Ellie gave up on me."
321,00:18:57,00:19:00,You never stop loving your kids.
322,00:19:00,00:19:05,There's a difference between giving up and letting go.
323,00:19:05,00:19:09,"Janet, you got to learn to let go."
324,00:19:13,00:19:15,(car door closes)
325,00:19:17,00:19:18,Can I help you?
326,00:19:19,00:19:21,What's going on here?
327,00:19:22,00:19:23,This is a police investigation. Who are you?
328,00:19:23,00:19:26,Bill Cornwell. This is my sister's house.
329,00:19:26,00:19:28,Let me see some I.D.
330,00:19:28,00:19:30,Okay.
331,00:19:36,00:19:37,You're not an organ donor?
332,00:19:37,00:19:40,"Look, Janet came home from the hospital this morning."
333,00:19:40,00:19:42,She should be resting. Where is she?
334,00:19:42,00:19:44,"Your sister's fine, Mr. Cornwell."
335,00:19:44,00:19:47,My sister hasn't been fine in a long time.
336,00:19:48,00:19:51,"That's why I have to come by every day; pay her bills, make sure she eats."
337,00:19:51,00:19:53,Is there something going on with the case?
338,00:19:53,00:19:55,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
339,00:19:55,00:19:57,I know. You can't talk about it.
340,00:19:57,00:20:00,"I just miss them, you know?"
341,00:20:00,00:20:01,Andy and Emily were great kids.
342,00:20:01,00:20:07,"Hey, Bill, while we're talking, have you ever met any of Emily's boyfriends?"
343,00:20:07,00:20:09,"If she did have any, she didn't bring them home."
344,00:20:09,00:20:10,Yeah? Why's that?
345,00:20:10,00:20:12,Mike was pretty protective of his little girl.
346,00:20:13,00:20:16,"And Em and Janet, you know, they had a pretty stormy relationship."
347,00:20:16,00:20:21,"Thanks for stopping by. Yeah, I hope you come up with something again."
348,00:20:21,00:20:22,We'll do the best we can.
349,00:20:22,00:20:23,Thanks.
350,00:20:23,00:20:25,You're welcome.
351,00:20:32,00:20:33,(engine starting) Hey.
352,00:20:33,00:20:34,Hey.
353,00:20:34,00:20:35,Janet's brother.
354,00:20:36,00:20:39,Heard you could use an extra hand.
355,00:20:39,00:20:41,"Yeah. Yeah, thanks, Ray."
356,00:20:41,00:20:47,"Greg's finishing up with the luminol inside, but so far, there's no evidence of any killing that took place here."
357,00:20:47,00:20:48,Let's check the garage.
358,00:21:03,00:21:05,It's frozen in time.
359,00:21:05,00:21:07,Just like the rest of the house.
360,00:21:07,00:21:08,Let's go to work.
361,00:21:22,00:21:25,The luminol's reacting with the detergent.
362,00:21:26,00:21:28,"Yeah, and the bleach."
363,00:21:35,00:21:37,Nick.
364,00:21:37,00:21:38,Hmm?
365,00:21:38,00:21:43,"I've got something over here, and it ain't bleach."
366,00:21:43,00:21:44,"No, sir."
367,00:21:46,00:21:48,We need to get up there.
368,00:21:53,00:21:55,LANGSTON: That's the stain that seeped through into the garage.
369,00:21:55,00:21:58,A trail of fluid leads back to...
370,00:21:58,00:22:00,this footlocker here.
371,00:22:00,00:22:03,U.S. Army standard issue.
372,00:22:04,00:22:09,A psychic told Janet that her son was dry but near water.
373,00:22:28,00:22:29,Oh.
374,00:22:39,00:22:42,LANGSTON: Andy was wearing pajamas the night he disappeared.
375,00:22:43,00:22:45,(sighs)
376,00:22:45,00:22:47,BRASS: Where exactly?
377,00:22:47,00:22:49,Have they recovered anything else?
378,00:22:49,00:22:51,"Okay, keep me posted, Nick."
379,00:22:54,00:22:55,"Jim, what is it?"
380,00:22:56,00:22:59,What? Did they find something?
381,00:22:59,00:23:02,Tell me.
382,00:23:03,00:23:05,They found Andy's body.
383,00:23:07,00:23:09,At the house?
384,00:23:09,00:23:11,No.
385,00:23:11,00:23:14,"Oh, he was with me all the time!"
386,00:23:14,00:23:15,(sobbing): He was with me!
387,00:23:16,00:23:18,Come on. No! No! No!
388,00:23:37,00:23:38,(sighs)
389,00:23:40,00:23:42,"You know, Doc..."
390,00:23:44,00:23:46,I'm against the death penalty...
391,00:23:47,00:23:49,...except when it comes to people who kill children.
392,00:23:49,00:23:55,I think they should be tortured first and then guillotined.
393,00:23:55,00:24:00,"ROBBINS: Every layer of friction ridged skin was eaten away by bugs, so I can't get prints."
394,00:24:00,00:24:03,Tissue sample should be able to confirm his identity through DNA.
395,00:24:03,00:24:06,"Well, I confirmed the remains as male."
396,00:24:06,00:24:08,Femur measured 11 inches.
397,00:24:08,00:24:10,That's consistent with an average nine-year-old.
398,00:24:10,00:24:15,The decay was consistent with a boy who's been dead approximately three years.
399,00:24:15,00:24:16,What about C.O.D.?
400,00:24:16,00:24:19,Blunt force trauma to the temporal bone.
401,00:24:19,00:24:21,Single blow? As far as I can tell.
402,00:24:21,00:24:26,The wound appears compatible of an object the size and shape of that flashlight I saw.
403,00:24:26,00:24:30,And there were bone fragments inside what was left his brain.
404,00:24:34,00:24:38,I can't tell you what Andy was feeling in the final moments of his life...
405,00:24:39,00:24:41,...but I do know he didn't suffer long.
406,00:24:41,00:24:44,He shouldn't have suffered at all.
407,00:24:44,00:24:48,(sobbing)
408,00:24:48,00:24:50,Her son's body was found in her garage.
409,00:24:50,00:24:51,She was in possession of the murder weapon.
410,00:24:51,00:24:53,That makes Janet Marsh suspect number one.
411,00:24:53,00:24:54,"We're taking her into custody, Jim."
412,00:24:54,00:24:56,The woman has been through hell.
413,00:24:56,00:25:00,She just found out that she's been living with her kid's corpse.
414,00:25:00,00:25:02,"Yeah, a corpse that was never in her husband's vehicle."
415,00:25:02,00:25:06,"Which means that her son's bloody pajama top was planted there, which brings us back to your friend Janet."
416,00:25:06,00:25:08,She didn't kill her family.
417,00:25:08,00:25:11,"Jim, I know you're trying to do your job, but you have a personal relationship with this woman."
418,00:25:11,00:25:13,Okay?
419,00:25:13,00:25:14,And that's not going to look good.
420,00:25:14,00:25:16,"Don't go there, Conrad, okay?"
421,00:25:16,00:25:18,"Jim, we're going to do this by the book."
422,00:25:18,00:25:20,"I'm not taking you off the case, but I want to interview her."
423,00:25:20,00:25:21,She knows me. She trusts me.
424,00:25:21,00:25:25,Let's just see what she'll say when she's talking to someone she doesn't know.
425,00:25:26,00:25:28,"Mrs. Marsh, my name's Conrad Ecklie."
426,00:25:29,00:25:30,I'm the undersheriff.
427,00:25:30,00:25:32,We need to ask you some questions.
428,00:25:34,00:25:37,"First, I need to make sure this waiver of attorney we have on file still applies."
429,00:25:37,00:25:39,Do you waive your right to have an attorney present?
430,00:25:40,00:25:41,"Yes or no, please? Yes."
431,00:25:41,00:25:44,I waive my right to have an attorney present.
432,00:25:44,00:25:47,"Janet, you remember me, yeah?"
433,00:25:47,00:25:49,We've talked before. Yes.
434,00:25:49,00:25:52,Guess we'll talk a little bit again here.
435,00:25:52,00:25:58,"Um, what can you tell me about the footlocker in the crawl space above the garage?"
436,00:25:58,00:26:01,"Oh, my God."
437,00:26:01,00:26:03,Was he in there?
438,00:26:05,00:26:07,"Stay with me now, Janet."
439,00:26:09,00:26:10,How long has it been there?
440,00:26:10,00:26:14,Since Mike got back from Desert Storm.
441,00:26:14,00:26:16,So it was your husband's footlocker?
442,00:26:16,00:26:19,Yes.
443,00:26:19,00:26:23,But we kept Andy's camping stuff in it.
444,00:26:23,00:26:24,He loved to camp.
445,00:26:30,00:26:34,STOKES: And how long has it been since you opened it?
446,00:26:36,00:26:41,JANET: We took a camping trip to Cathedral Gorge that summer.
447,00:26:41,00:26:43,"The kids, Mike, Bill and me."
448,00:26:43,00:26:44,And Bill is...?
449,00:26:44,00:26:47,My brother.
450,00:26:47,00:26:49,He spent more time with the kids than their own father.
451,00:26:49,00:26:53,Taught Andy to fish.
452,00:26:53,00:27:01,"Uh, Emily was being difficult, so I brought her home."
453,00:27:01,00:27:06,I'm pretty sure they put the locker away when they got back.
454,00:27:15,00:27:20,You think I killed my little boy?
455,00:27:20,00:27:22,My daughter? My husband?
456,00:27:25,00:27:32,"I can't move because I'm afraid if they come back, they won't be able to find me."
457,00:27:33,00:27:37,"I can't sleep, and so I go looking for them on the highway."
458,00:27:37,00:27:40,It's all I do!
459,00:27:40,00:27:43,Why can't you people understand that?
460,00:27:43,00:27:47,"I hire psychics to help me, and then people think I'm crazy."
461,00:27:47,00:27:50,This is making me crazy!
462,00:27:50,00:27:54,And it's got to stop!
463,00:27:54,00:27:57,It's got to stop!
464,00:28:00,00:28:03,LANGSTON: I collected 16 prints.
465,00:28:03,00:28:05,Six were identifiable.
466,00:28:05,00:28:08,Five were on the bottom panel of the footlocker.
467,00:28:08,00:28:10,Position suggests that someone was trying to pick it up.
468,00:28:11,00:28:14,All five were a match to Mike Marsh.
469,00:28:14,00:28:16,Identified by an old work card.
470,00:28:16,00:28:18,Construction contract at the Eclipse.
471,00:28:20,00:28:21,This one...
472,00:28:23,00:28:24,is unknown.
473,00:28:24,00:28:26,Did you check it against the brother?
474,00:28:26,00:28:30,"Yes. Everyone's money is on Uncle Bill, but no match."
475,00:28:30,00:28:32,Print could belong to one of the kids.
476,00:28:32,00:28:35,David Phillips was unable to get any fingerprints off the boy's body.
477,00:28:35,00:28:38,And there were no exemplars from Andy or Emily in the file.
478,00:29:27,00:29:28,LANGSTON: What made you collect this?
479,00:29:29,00:29:34,"Emily's room was full of stuff that belonged to her, but this was actually a part of her."
480,00:29:44,00:29:45,No hit on your lid print.
481,00:29:45,00:29:48,"It was a long-shot, but we had to play it."
482,00:29:53,00:29:54,Wait a sec.
483,00:29:55,00:29:57,That's impossible. There were no exemplars.
484,00:29:57,00:29:58,She can't be in AFIS.
485,00:29:58,00:30:00,What did Emily's print hit on?
486,00:30:00,00:30:05,"Current work card-- Hope Wilson, Reno, Nevada."
487,00:30:05,00:30:08,"Date of birth, September 2, 1992."
488,00:30:08,00:30:10,"It's a different name, but it's the same birthday."
489,00:30:14,00:30:16,That is Emily Marsh.
490,00:30:24,00:30:26,MAN: Suspect's vehicle is approaching.
491,00:30:27,00:30:28,Let's go.
492,00:30:33,00:30:35,"Emily Marsh, step out of the vehicle."
493,00:30:35,00:30:37,Emily Marsh?
494,00:30:37,00:30:38,My name is Hope Wilson.
495,00:30:38,00:30:40,Put your weapons away.
496,00:30:40,00:30:41,Mommy.
497,00:30:42,00:30:43,There's a child in the backseat.
498,00:30:43,00:30:44,Call Child Services.
499,00:30:44,00:30:46,"Get an ambulance, get the kid back to Vegas."
500,00:30:46,00:30:48,"Emily Marsh, you're under arrest. Come with me."
501,00:30:48,00:30:50,My name is Hope Wilson. Please don't hurt my son.
502,00:30:50,00:30:53,He'll be fine.
503,00:30:56,00:30:58,"Oh, Conner, don't be sad."
504,00:30:58,00:31:00,Everything's cool.
505,00:31:00,00:31:03,"Hey, I got something for you. You want to see?"
506,00:31:06,00:31:07,Pick one.
507,00:31:07,00:31:08,Green.
508,00:31:08,00:31:10,Green?
509,00:31:10,00:31:11,Are you sure? The red's really good.
510,00:31:11,00:31:13,Uh-uh. I'll make you a deal.
511,00:31:13,00:31:17,"You try the red one, and if you don't like it, I'll give you the green one."
512,00:31:17,00:31:19,Okay. Okay.
513,00:31:20,00:31:21,There you go.
514,00:31:24,00:31:26,(chuckles) You don't like it?
515,00:31:26,00:31:29,"Okay. All right, the green one it is then."
516,00:31:29,00:31:30,There you go.
517,00:31:31,00:31:32,Good?
518,00:31:32,00:31:34,Good.
519,00:31:34,00:31:36,How old are you?
520,00:31:36,00:31:37,Three? No way.
521,00:31:39,00:31:40,You're a big boy.
522,00:31:40,00:31:42,You like that one?
523,00:31:42,00:31:44,I got to get me a green one.
524,00:31:44,00:31:47,WILLOWS: We know who you are.
525,00:31:47,00:31:49,You're Emily Marsh.
526,00:31:49,00:31:53,Your fingerprints confirm it.
527,00:31:53,00:31:58,"Emily, we've been looking for you for three years."
528,00:31:58,00:32:00,We're still looking for your father.
529,00:32:00,00:32:03,Can you tell me what happened?
530,00:32:08,00:32:12,I'm going to need to take your DNA to confirm you're the mother of Conner.
531,00:32:12,00:32:14,I am.
532,00:32:15,00:32:17,Who's the father?
533,00:32:26,00:32:28,Open up please.
534,00:32:37,00:32:38,"How's it going in here, Ray?"
535,00:32:38,00:32:46,Looks like we're back to square two. You know her neighbors in Reno said that Emily was living with her husband-- an older guy.
536,00:32:47,00:32:50,"LANGSTON: Conner's father, Doug Wilson."
537,00:32:50,00:32:54,"D.O.B. September 14, 1967. Age..."
538,00:32:54,00:32:55,Forty-three.
539,00:32:56,00:32:57,Mike Marsh would have been 43.
540,00:32:57,00:33:00,People on the run are desperate.
541,00:33:00,00:33:03,"They're not thinking straight. They change their names, but they forget to change their date of birth."
542,00:33:03,00:33:05,(typing)
543,00:33:05,00:33:06,(computer trilling)
544,00:33:13,00:33:14,LANGSTON: Doug Wilson.
545,00:33:14,00:33:16,That's the same face.
546,00:33:16,00:33:20,Father and daughter living as husband and wife.
547,00:33:20,00:33:22,Connor was three.
548,00:33:22,00:33:25,Emily was pregnant before she disappeared.
549,00:33:25,00:33:27,Her father's the father.
550,00:33:27,00:33:30,I want to see Emily now.
551,00:33:30,00:33:32,It's gonna be a while.
552,00:33:32,00:33:33,We haven't finished talking to her yet.
553,00:33:34,00:33:36,Why? What's the matter?
554,00:33:36,00:33:37,Emily is safe.
555,00:33:37,00:33:40,"So keep that in the front of your mind, okay?"
556,00:33:40,00:33:45,"But things are unraveling very quickly, and there've been some unexpected developments."
557,00:33:48,00:33:49,Mike is alive.
558,00:33:51,00:33:55,Emily has a child.
559,00:33:55,00:33:56,What?
560,00:33:57,00:33:58,He's three years old.
561,00:33:59,00:34:04,"How...? No, no, that can't be."
562,00:34:04,00:34:05,How could that be?
563,00:34:05,00:34:06,Captain. Yeah?
564,00:34:06,00:34:08,There's a Doug Wilson at the Reception.
565,00:34:08,00:34:10,Wants to talk to you. Okay.
566,00:34:10,00:34:12,"I'm gonna send someone home with you, okay?"
567,00:34:12,00:34:14,And I'll call you later.
568,00:34:16,00:34:20,"(quietly): As soon as I take him to Interrogation, get her out of here."
569,00:34:20,00:34:22,Yeah.
570,00:34:22,00:34:24,"Oh, my..."
571,00:34:24,00:34:26,"(sobs): Oh, my God."
572,00:34:31,00:34:34,Mike Marsh.
573,00:34:35,00:34:36,"Have you arrested him? Yes, Captain."
574,00:34:36,00:34:38,That's why I'm here.
575,00:34:38,00:34:41,"I'm the guy you want, not my daughter."
576,00:34:41,00:34:43,Emily didn't do anything wrong.
577,00:34:43,00:34:45,We're gonna talk about that.
578,00:34:45,00:34:46,Let's go.
579,00:34:46,00:34:48,I made the decision to run!
580,00:34:48,00:34:49,I took her with me.
581,00:34:49,00:34:53,Let Emily and her son go! She didn't have anything to do with Andy's death!
582,00:34:53,00:34:55,I killed him! It was an accident.
583,00:34:55,00:34:56,It was all me.
584,00:34:56,00:34:58,Did you hear what I said?
585,00:34:58,00:34:59,It was all my fault.
586,00:35:00,00:35:01,I killed my son.
587,00:35:02,00:35:03,(screams)
588,00:35:03,00:35:05,You sick bastard!
589,00:35:06,00:35:08,You were supposed to protect our children!
590,00:35:09,00:35:10,Get down!
591,00:35:29,00:35:30,Dad?
592,00:35:38,00:35:39,Dad!
593,00:35:39,00:35:42,(sobbing): Daddy!
594,00:35:43,00:35:47,Daddy! (sobbing)
595,00:35:47,00:35:49,"Daddy, what happened?"
596,00:35:50,00:35:52,What happened? Daddy.
597,00:35:52,00:35:53,No!
598,00:35:53,00:35:56,(sighs)
599,00:36:01,00:36:06,"A man murders his son, impregnates his daughter."
600,00:36:06,00:36:07,Why turn yourself in?
601,00:36:07,00:36:10,"I mean, he ran once, why not run again?"
602,00:36:10,00:36:15,"Maybe he thought, in his own sick, twisted way, that he was really in love with her."
603,00:36:16,00:36:20,And then he found out that she and their son we're in custody?
604,00:36:20,00:36:22,He wanted to protect the both of them.
605,00:36:23,00:36:25,DNA results on Connor Wilson came back.
606,00:36:25,00:36:28,He shares more than 20 alleles with Emily.
607,00:36:28,00:36:30,Because Connor's mother and father were father and daughter.
608,00:36:31,00:36:33,The extra alleles come from the maternal DNA.
609,00:36:33,00:36:35,Say again?
610,00:36:35,00:36:39,Mike Marsh is not Connor Wilson's father.
611,00:36:39,00:36:42,His father shares seven alleles with Janet Marsh.
612,00:36:42,00:36:43,Janet's brother?
613,00:36:43,00:36:45,Uncle Bill.
614,00:36:45,00:36:50,I told my mom I didn't want Uncle Bill to come over anymore.
615,00:36:50,00:36:56,"She said I was ungrateful, and it was her house."
616,00:36:56,00:36:59,This whole thing is her fault!
617,00:36:59,00:37:01,Everything is her fault!
618,00:37:01,00:37:04,When did your dad find out?
619,00:37:07,00:37:09,That night.
620,00:37:09,00:37:12,My dad was still at work.
621,00:37:12,00:37:14,Uncle Bill let himself in.
622,00:37:14,00:37:20,"I thought since I was pregnant, he would leave me alone, but he didn't."
623,00:37:22,00:37:24,Andy should've been in bed.
624,00:37:28,00:37:30,(Bill speaking indistinctly)
625,00:37:30,00:37:32,(Emily sobbing)
626,00:37:49,00:37:53,"When Uncle Bill left, I went to find Andy."
627,00:37:53,00:37:55,I didn't even know what to say.
628,00:37:55,00:37:57,But the way he looked at me...
629,00:37:57,00:38:02,"He started yelling, ""I'm gonna tell Mom! I'm gonna tell Mom!"
630,00:38:02,00:38:06,"I'm gonna tell Mom!"" She would have blamed me!"
631,00:38:07,00:38:09,I just wanted him to shut up!
632,00:38:09,00:38:11,I'm gonna tell Mom! I'm gonna tell Mom!
633,00:38:11,00:38:13,Quit it! You're not gonna tell Mom!
634,00:38:13,00:38:16,"Yes, I am! Get that thing out of my face!"
635,00:38:16,00:38:17,You're gonna be in so much trouble!
636,00:38:17,00:38:19,Shut up!
637,00:38:21,00:38:25,"When my dad came home and found us, I told him everything."
638,00:38:27,00:38:28,"Emmy, what happened?"
639,00:38:28,00:38:30,(sobbing)
640,00:38:30,00:38:32,I'm sorry.
641,00:38:32,00:38:38,"He said it wasn't my fault, that he'd make it all better."
642,00:38:39,00:38:43,My dad said we'd come back someday and bury him.
643,00:38:48,00:38:50,My dad was just trying to protect me.
644,00:38:50,00:38:52,He didn't do anything wrong.
645,00:38:56,00:38:57,(sobbing)
646,00:39:05,00:39:08,I loved my brother.
647,00:39:15,00:39:16,I'm sorry.
648,00:39:16,00:39:18,I'm so sorry!
649,00:39:18,00:39:20,(sobbing)
650,00:39:27,00:39:30,The D.A. has decided not to file charges against Emily.
651,00:39:30,00:39:34,She'll be a much better mother than I ever was.
652,00:39:34,00:39:38,I never could talk with Emily...
653,00:39:38,00:39:41,even when she was little.
654,00:39:41,00:39:43,Andy was different.
655,00:39:43,00:39:46,He was so easy to love.
656,00:39:48,00:39:53,This all happened because they knew I could never forgive her.
657,00:39:56,00:40:01,I hope one day she can learn to forgive me.
658,00:40:05,00:40:07,Okay.
659,00:40:08,00:40:10,(sighs)
660,00:41:09,00:41:10,"Okay, there's your mom."
661,00:41:10,00:41:12,It's time to go.
662,00:41:12,00:41:14,"But before you leave, how about..."
663,00:41:14,00:41:16,a green one for the road?
664,00:41:17,00:41:19,"All right, you're a good boy."
665,00:41:19,00:41:21,"Go on, you little CSI. Mom!"
666,00:41:21,00:41:23,Hey.
667,00:41:23,00:41:25,Hi. Mommy.
668,00:41:25,00:41:26,How are you?
669,00:41:26,00:41:27,Are you okay? Yeah.
670,00:41:27,00:41:28,Yeah?
671,00:41:29,00:41:31,I missed you.
672,00:41:31,00:41:34,Let me see you.
