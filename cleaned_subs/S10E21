0	00:00:07	00:00:08	Whoo!
1	00:00:14	00:00:16	Slam it, slam it!
2	00:00:16	00:00:17	Whoo!
3	00:00:17	00:00:22	Okay, 39 hours and you're an old married bitch!
4	00:00:24	00:00:27	I'm not married yet and you're the bitch!
5	00:00:27	00:00:31	Whoo! No, n-no, n-no, you're driving, I'm drinking.
6	00:00:31	00:00:32	Brenda, flash the trucker.
7	00:00:32	00:00:35	Flash the trucker, flash the trucker!
8	00:00:35	00:00:38	Flash the trucker, flash him!
9	00:00:46	00:00:47	Uh-oh!
10	00:00:59	00:01:00	Hey, yo, there's a car!
11	00:01:15	00:01:18	Look, sir, it's just standard operating procedure.
12	00:01:18	00:01:24	Hey, I told you I wasn't drinking, but those girls, they must have been on something.
13	00:01:26	00:01:27	What about the pedestrian that was hit?
14	00:01:27	00:01:28	Did you see where she came from?
15	00:01:28	00:01:31	I didn't see her till she was on the ground.
16	00:01:31	00:01:32	Girls were screaming.
17	00:01:32	00:01:33	I'm the one that called 911.
18	00:01:33	00:01:35	Thank you.
19	00:01:35	00:01:36	All right, calm down.
20	00:01:36	00:01:38	Tell me what happened before you hit that lady.
21	00:01:38	00:01:39	We didn't hit her.
22	00:01:39	00:01:40	She hit us.
23	00:01:40	00:01:42	Shut up, Claire.
24	00:01:42	00:01:44	You girls been drinking tonight?
25	00:01:44	00:01:46	Is that woman going to die?
26	00:01:46	00:01:47	I don't know.
27	00:01:47	00:01:49	Which one of you was driving?
28	00:01:49	00:01:54	All right, Mitch, Breathalyzers and sobriety tests times three.
29	00:01:54	00:01:55	Got you. But I'm getting married this weekend.
30	00:01:55	00:01:58	And if he loves you, he'll wait.
31	00:01:58	00:02:01	Julie was driving. Julie?
32	00:02:01	00:02:04	I'm not going to miss my wedding for you.
33	00:02:07	00:02:10	You got a whole desert here.
34	00:02:11	00:02:14	Hey, Nick, what do you got?
35	00:02:14	00:02:17	Why can't people just wait till they get to Vegas to start partying?
36	00:02:17	00:02:18	Is that so difficult?
37	00:02:18	00:02:19	Well, it is for some people.
38	00:02:19	00:02:22	You know what they say-- beer before wine, you'll be fine.
39	00:02:22	00:02:24	Yeah, wine after liquor, never sicker.
40	00:02:24	00:02:26	Hmm. Which is probably the case here.
41	00:02:26	00:02:29	Right front tire is flat and as you can see, this front bumper is just shredded.
42	00:02:29	00:02:31	Yeah, that looks like the point of impact.
43	00:02:31	00:02:33	Paramedic said he found the victim over there.
44	00:02:33	00:02:38	I'm still trying to figure out what she was doing out here all by herself in the middle of nowhere.
45	00:02:49	00:02:53	We moved her from critical to stable, but it's going to be a while before you can talk to her.
46	00:02:54	00:02:56	Okay, thank you. Okay.
47	00:02:57	00:02:59	Hey, Jim. Hey.
48	00:02:59	00:03:01	Greg found an abandoned vehicle about a mile from the scene.
49	00:03:01	00:03:03	It could be the victim's.
50	00:03:03	00:03:05	Keys and wallet were under the seat, Nevada license.
51	00:03:05	00:03:09	Her name is Janet Marie Marsh.
52	00:03:09	00:03:11	She lives in Seven Hills.
53	00:03:11	00:03:13	She's a friend.
54	00:03:15	00:03:20	About three years ago, her husband and two kids went missing.
55	00:03:20	00:03:24	We found his abandoned SUV with blood inside on the I-15.
56	00:03:24	00:03:28	She was hit near mile marker 41.
57	00:03:28	00:03:30	It's the same stretch of road.
58	00:03:31	00:03:33	She lost her whole family.
59	00:03:33	00:03:35	She was looking for them.
60	00:03:36	00:03:39	She's looking for ghosts.
61	00:04:12	00:04:16	There's always a case that just won't let you go.
62	00:04:16	00:04:18	I carried this around in my wallet for three years.
63	00:04:18	00:04:25	This is the husband, Mike Marsh, and the two kids-- that's Andy, age nine, and Emily, age 15.
64	00:04:25	00:04:27	Hmm, how did it all go down?
65	00:04:27	00:04:30	Well, Janet got out of work a little after midnight.
66	00:04:30	00:04:33	Comes home, nobody's there, you know.
67	00:04:33	00:04:35	So she calls her husband, she calls her daughter-- no answer.
68	00:04:35	00:04:38	She, uh, calls her brother who lives nearby.
69	00:04:38	00:04:41	He doesn't know anything about it, so calls the hospital and then she calls us.
70	00:04:41	00:04:42	We put out a broadcast.
71	00:04:42	00:04:48	00 a.m., Highway Patrol found an abandoned SUV on I-15 North.
72	00:04:48	00:04:54	Inside we find the husband and the daughter's blood in the backseat and a bloody pajama top of the young boy.
73	00:04:54	00:04:59	Not enough blood to confirm death, but it was certainly enough to suspect serious injury.
74	00:04:59	00:05:01	That's all the evidence we recovered.
75	00:05:01	00:05:03	Case went cold.
76	00:05:03	00:05:06	And she just keeps going back out to the crime scene?
77	00:05:07	00:05:08	Yeah.
78	00:05:16	00:05:23	You know, I usually work scenes like this solo-- deserted stretches of highway, nothing around but coyotes.
79	00:05:23	00:05:27	I used to consider it punishment, but now I enjoy the quiet.
80	00:05:28	00:05:30	I can leave if you like.
81	00:05:33	00:05:37	Looks like the convertible bottomed out here.
82	00:05:37	00:05:42	Yeah, this dip probably caused the car to bleed off a lot of speed.
83	00:05:42	00:05:44	It's probably why the victim is still alive.
84	00:05:46	00:05:48	Something in the bushes.
85	00:05:56	00:05:58	I got a flashlight...
86	00:05:59	00:06:02	with what appears to be fresh blood on the grip.
87	00:06:04	00:06:06	Could've belonged to the victim.
88	00:06:06	00:06:09	And you didn't have any suspects?
89	00:06:09	00:06:10	I kinda liked the brother.
90	00:06:10	00:06:12	Name is Bill Cornwell.
91	00:06:12	00:06:13	He has a construction business.
92	00:06:13	00:06:16	He was in partnership with Mike Marsh.
93	00:06:16	00:06:18	There's a lot of debt, a lot of insurance.
94	00:06:18	00:06:20	That's motive right there, Jim.
95	00:06:20	00:06:22	We brought him in, we interrogated him, you know?
96	00:06:22	00:06:24	He didn't give me a straight answer. He was very cagey.
97	00:06:24	00:06:26	I just didn't like his face. I felt he was lying.
98	00:06:26	00:06:28	But he had an airtight alibi.
99	00:06:28	00:06:30	Captain, she has a concussion.
100	00:06:30	00:06:32	Her left ulna's fractured in two different places.
101	00:06:32	00:06:33	There's no internal bleeding.
102	00:06:33	00:06:36	She got lucky. I'm going to keep her under observation for a few more hours.
103	00:06:36	00:06:37	That's great news. Thank you, Doctor.
104	00:06:37	00:06:39	Okay. Thanks for your help.
105	00:06:39	00:06:40	Thanks. Mm-hmm.
106	00:06:40	00:06:42	Would you mind if I just...?
107	00:06:42	00:06:43	Give me a minute? No, please.
108	00:06:43	00:06:46	Thanks. Go ahead.
109	00:06:51	00:06:53	I thought we had a deal.
110	00:06:54	00:06:58	No more moonlight hikes.
111	00:06:58	00:06:59	What happened out there?
112	00:06:59	00:07:02	How are the girls?
113	00:07:03	00:07:04	Did their parents get notified?
114	00:07:04	00:07:07	Come on, Detective. Don't do my job for me.
115	00:07:07	00:07:08	Okay.
116	00:07:09	00:07:12	This is CSI Nick Stokes.
117	00:07:12	00:07:15	He's got to do a little work, okay?
118	00:07:15	00:07:19	Mrs. Marsh, I'm here to, um, document your injuries and collect your clothing, okay?
119	00:07:19	00:07:23	Janet, they're gonna release you in about two hours.
120	00:07:23	00:07:25	I'm gonna come back and give you a ride home, okay?
121	00:07:29	00:07:30	Ooh!
122	00:07:31	00:07:33	How many stitches did they give you?
123	00:07:33	00:07:35	You're wasting your time.
124	00:07:35	00:07:37	I'm not going to press charges.
125	00:07:37	00:07:41	Well, that's up to the D.A., but I'll put it in my report.
126	00:07:41	00:07:43	Jim told you all about me, didn't he?
127	00:07:43	00:07:49	I can tell by the look in your eyes you pity the poor crazy lady who lost her family.
128	00:07:49	00:07:51	No.
129	00:07:51	00:07:53	Yes. No, I don't.
130	00:07:53	00:07:55	Listen, I don't pity you.
131	00:07:55	00:07:58	Honestly, I completely understand.
132	00:07:58	00:08:03	If I lost my whole family like that, I would never stop looking for them until I got some answers.
133	00:08:04	00:08:07	No matter what.
134	00:08:07	00:08:11	Can you remember anything about the car accident?
135	00:08:11	00:08:13	Mommy, Mommy, I'm here!
136	00:08:13	00:08:15	He was calling me.
137	00:08:16	00:08:17	Mommy, Mommy, I'm here!
138	00:08:18	00:08:19	Mommy, I'm here!
139	00:08:28	00:08:31	Sometimes I get lost in my thoughts.
140	00:08:31	00:08:32	Is that what happened last night?
141	00:08:32	00:08:33	You got lost in your thoughts?
142	00:08:33	00:08:40	No. I was out following a lead on the case.
143	00:08:40	00:08:42	And did you tell Captain Brass about that lead?
144	00:08:42	00:08:44	Uh-uh.
145	00:08:44	00:08:46	Because the lead came from a psychic.
146	00:08:46	00:08:50	A reputable one who's worked with the LAPD.
147	00:08:50	00:08:52	Jim thinks it's all hocus-pocus.
148	00:08:52	00:08:54	You probably do, too.
149	00:08:54	00:08:57	No, ma'am. I've learned to keep an open mind.
150	00:08:58	00:09:01	This job will do that to you, you know?
151	00:09:03	00:09:06	This psychic...
152	00:09:06	00:09:10	she's sure that Andy is dry, yet near water.
153	00:09:10	00:09:14	Did you know that Vegas is built on some underground springs?
154	00:09:14	00:09:15	Yeah.
155	00:09:15	00:09:16	Well, I got a map.
156	00:09:16	00:09:21	And there's a spring in the desert right under where they found Mike's Jeep.
157	00:09:21	00:09:24	See-- dry, yet near water.
158	00:09:24	00:09:25	Mommy, Mommy, help me.
159	00:09:26	00:09:27	Help me!
160	00:09:27	00:09:28	Mommy, please...
161	00:09:28	00:09:29	Please help me.
162	00:09:30	00:09:31	Andy's so close.
163	00:09:33	00:09:35	He wants me to find him.
164	00:09:35	00:09:37	I feel him all around me still.
165	00:09:41	00:09:44	What about your husband and your daughter?
166	00:09:47	00:09:49	Never.
167	00:09:50	00:09:51	Isn't that terrible?
168	00:09:51	00:09:52	No.
169	00:10:28	00:10:29	Hey, Greg.
170	00:10:29	00:10:31	you gotta come take a look at this.
171	00:10:33	00:10:39	I was just processing the fresh blood from the grip, and I noticed old blood and tissue in this ring around the lens.
172	00:10:39	00:10:41	Old blood? Yeah.
173	00:10:41	00:10:43	So it can't be casual transfer from the vic.
174	00:10:43	00:10:45	Has to be from an earlier event.
175	00:10:45	00:10:47	Right.
176	00:10:47	00:10:50	And that impact had to be significant enough to actually damage tissue.
177	00:10:50	00:10:56	Plus those are hair fragments right there, which tells me that somebody was whacked on the head.
178	00:11:02	00:11:08	So, uh, Wendy got a hit on the blood and tissue from Janet Marsh's flashlight.
179	00:11:08	00:11:11	Familial match to her son Andy.
180	00:11:11	00:11:14	We could be looking at our murder weapon.
181	00:11:14	00:11:19	So this woman's been searching for her son all these years with the exact same flashlight that was used to kill him?
182	00:11:19	00:11:23	If Janet Marsh was in possession of the murder weapon, that makes her the only suspect.
183	00:11:23	00:11:24	Wait a minute now.
184	00:11:24	00:11:26	I've met the woman.
185	00:11:26	00:11:28	It's very tough to fake grief like that.
186	00:11:28	00:11:30	Well, guilt can masquerade as grief.
187	00:11:30	00:11:35	And there's a lot of people who express remorse after committing a homicide.
188	00:11:35	00:11:43	If this were the father that we were talking about and not the mother, what would we be thinking then?
189	00:11:43	00:11:44	Lock him up?
190	00:11:44	00:11:48	And, ordinarily, we'd be right, but this is by no means an ordinary case.
191	00:11:56	00:11:58	Hi. How you feeling, Janet?
192	00:11:58	00:11:59	Better?
193	00:11:59	00:12:00	I'm okay.
194	00:12:00	00:12:01	Good.
195	00:12:01	00:12:04	So, what brings you here?
196	00:12:04	00:12:05	We found some new evidence.
197	00:12:05	00:12:06	It concerns Andy.
198	00:12:06	00:12:07	You found my son?
199	00:12:07	00:12:11	Uh, no, ma'am, but with your help, we may be able to.
200	00:12:11	00:12:13	Okay.
201	00:12:13	00:12:15	Come on in.
202	00:12:33	00:12:34	So, what can I do?
203	00:12:34	00:12:35	How can I help?
204	00:12:35	00:12:37	You had a flashlight with you last night.
205	00:12:37	00:12:38	Yes.
206	00:12:38	00:12:39	Where did you get that?
207	00:12:40	00:12:41	It was in the car.
208	00:12:41	00:12:43	Okay, so it's yours. Yes.
209	00:12:43	00:12:46	Oh. And where do you keep that, in the car?
210	00:12:46	00:12:48	In the kitchen. How long have had the flashlight?
211	00:12:48	00:12:50	Uh, ten years.
212	00:12:50	00:12:52	Since we bought the house.
213	00:12:52	00:12:54	(chuckles) Why are they asking about the flashlight?
214	00:12:54	00:12:57	We found Andy's blood on it.
215	00:12:59	00:13:01	Well, how can that be?
216	00:13:01	00:13:04	You all searched the house already.
217	00:13:05	00:13:08	When we searched Mike's Jeep, that became our crime scene.
218	00:13:08	00:13:11	Mrs. Marsh, we'd like permission to process your house.
219	00:13:11	00:13:13	Of course.
220	00:13:13	00:13:15	Kitchen's that way.
221	00:13:18	00:13:20	Control, 257 Adam, copy.
222	00:13:20	00:13:21	Responding at three.
223	00:13:21	00:13:23	252 Boy, Control.
224	00:13:23	00:13:26	Respond to a 417 at 273 Adams Street.
225	00:13:26	00:13:28	Informant will meet you in front of the house.
226	00:13:31	00:13:34	When did you get the police scanner?
227	00:13:34	00:13:37	Oh, I hardly listen to that thing anymore.
228	00:13:37	00:13:40	It's in the kitchen.
229	00:13:40	00:13:42	Yeah. Let-let me show you where I keep the...
230	00:13:42	00:13:46	No, no. You can just point it out for me, if you don't mind.
231	00:13:46	00:13:49	I keep it in the last drawer.
232	00:13:52	00:13:54	Come on, Janet. I'll buy you lunch.
233	00:13:59	00:14:03	All right, I got a police report here with a supplemental in Brass' handwriting.
234	00:14:03	00:14:08	Time cards substantiate that Janet Marsh was working 00 p.m.
235	00:14:08	00:14:10	to midnight the night her family went missing.
236	00:14:11	00:14:12	She had an alibi.
237	00:14:12	00:14:16	But she didn't call 911 00 a.m.
238	00:14:16	00:14:26	Which would've given Janet Marsh time to kill her family, to clean up, to dispose of the bodies and to dump the bloody truck, which gave her a diversion and took us 23 miles away from the house.
239	00:14:27	00:14:28	That's a lot for one person to do.
240	00:14:29	00:14:32	So, if she did it, she had to have help.
241	00:14:36	00:14:40	If a stranger committed these murders, he would've brought his own weapon.
242	00:14:40	00:14:46	And if he didn't, he would've done a quick search of the room and grabbed one of these knives.
243	00:14:46	00:14:49	Why would he pick a flashlight?
244	00:14:49	00:14:51	And why put it back in the drawer?
245	00:14:51	00:14:54	Maybe force of habit.
246	00:14:54	00:14:57	Or the killer thought he cleaned it off and put it back where it belonged.
247	00:14:57	00:15:00	Either way, it suggests we're looking at a family member or a friend.
248	00:15:00	00:15:03	Janet admitted to Brass that her marriage was rocky.
249	00:15:04	00:15:06	A lot of marriages end because of infidelity.
250	00:15:06	00:15:07	Maybe she was seeing someone.
251	00:15:07	00:15:08	Brass checked her phone records.
252	00:15:09	00:15:10	There was no unusual calls.
253	00:15:10	00:15:13	Looks like she talked to her brother at least twice a day.
254	00:15:13	00:15:19	Let's say Janet snapped, killed her family, calls brother Bill.
255	00:15:19	00:15:20	He helps her cover it up.
256	00:15:20	00:15:24	Well, Brass' gut told him that the brother was involved, but the guy had a ironclad alibi.
257	00:15:24	00:15:27	He was questioned a dozen times.
258	00:15:27	00:15:30	Searched his home, his office, his car.
259	00:15:30	00:15:34	Still, Janet told Nick that she had hallucinations about her dead son.
260	00:15:34	00:15:37	It sounds like she was experiencing some kind of dissociative episode.
261	00:15:37	00:15:41	Her personality splintered because of the guilt.
262	00:15:41	00:15:43	This is why she wanders the highway at night.
263	00:15:43	00:15:45	She's being tormented by her own conscience.
264	00:15:45	00:15:51	Or she's a cold-blooded murderer who's still playing out her diversion to keep the suspicion away.
265	00:17:21	00:17:23	Hey, check this out.
266	00:17:23	00:17:26	This is the latest issue of this magazine.
267	00:17:26	00:17:29	Janet Marsh never canceled her son's subscription.
268	00:17:29	00:17:33	You know. it looks to me like she just quit living the night her family disappeared.
269	00:17:33	00:17:37	And she's not going to live again until she gets some answers.
270	00:17:37	00:17:39	What's that?
271	00:17:39	00:17:41	Her daughter had a diary.
272	00:17:41	00:17:43	Listen to this.
273	00:17:43	00:17:46	He gave me the coolest bracelet today and told me how special I am.
274	00:17:46	00:17:53	He's the only one who understands me, especially since my mom only cares about Andy, and my dad's never home.
275	00:17:53	00:17:59	I love him, and I wish he could take me away from here. Maybe someday.
276	00:18:00	00:18:02	Did Brass interview the boyfriend?
277	00:18:02	00:18:03	Brass never mentioned a boyfriend.
278	00:18:03	00:18:08	Well, this is the last entry, five months before her disappearance.
279	00:18:08	00:18:12	She wrote in this journal every day for a year, and then just stopped.
280	00:18:12	00:18:16	There must have been something going on, especially at that age.
281	00:18:16	00:18:18	Maybe a significant event with a significant other?
282	00:18:18	00:18:21	A boyfriend could've known his way around the house.
283	00:18:21	00:18:23	What's his name? We'll have Brass round him up.
284	00:18:23	00:18:24	She doesn't even mention his name.
285	00:18:24	00:18:26	Not even an initial.
286	00:18:26	00:18:29	Ah, that's weird.
287	00:18:29	00:18:31	Maybe it was someone her parents didn't approve of.
288	00:18:35	00:18:37	You think they're dead, don't you?
289	00:18:37	00:18:44	It's just that I always had this feeling that somehow Andy got away.
290	00:18:45	00:18:47	What about your daughter?
291	00:18:47	00:18:49	Could you ever give up on Ellie?
292	00:18:54	00:18:57	Actually, I think in some ways Ellie gave up on me.
293	00:18:57	00:19:00	You never stop loving your kids.
294	00:19:00	00:19:05	There's a difference between giving up and letting go.
295	00:19:05	00:19:09	Janet, you got to learn to let go.
296	00:19:17	00:19:18	Can I help you?
297	00:19:19	00:19:21	What's going on here?
298	00:19:22	00:19:23	This is a police investigation. Who are you?
299	00:19:23	00:19:26	Bill Cornwell. This is my sister's house.
300	00:19:26	00:19:28	Let me see some I.D.
301	00:19:28	00:19:30	Okay.
302	00:19:36	00:19:37	You're not an organ donor?
303	00:19:37	00:19:40	Look, Janet came home from the hospital this morning.
304	00:19:40	00:19:42	She should be resting. Where is she?
305	00:19:42	00:19:44	Your sister's fine, Mr. Cornwell.
306	00:19:44	00:19:47	My sister hasn't been fine in a long time.
307	00:19:48	00:19:51	That's why I have to come by every day; pay her bills, make sure she eats.
308	00:19:51	00:19:53	Is there something going on with the case?
309	00:19:53	00:19:55	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
310	00:19:55	00:19:57	I know. You can't talk about it.
311	00:19:57	00:20:00	I just miss them, you know?
312	00:20:00	00:20:01	Andy and Emily were great kids.
313	00:20:01	00:20:07	Hey, Bill, while we're talking, have you ever met any of Emily's boyfriends?
314	00:20:07	00:20:09	If she did have any, she didn't bring them home.
315	00:20:09	00:20:10	Yeah? Why's that?
316	00:20:10	00:20:12	Mike was pretty protective of his little girl.
317	00:20:13	00:20:16	And Em and Janet, you know, they had a pretty stormy relationship.
318	00:20:16	00:20:21	Thanks for stopping by. Yeah, I hope you come up with something again.
319	00:20:21	00:20:22	We'll do the best we can.
320	00:20:22	00:20:23	Thanks.
321	00:20:23	00:20:25	You're welcome.
322	00:20:32	00:20:33	(engine starting) Hey.
323	00:20:33	00:20:34	Hey.
324	00:20:34	00:20:35	Janet's brother.
325	00:20:36	00:20:39	Heard you could use an extra hand.
326	00:20:39	00:20:41	Yeah. Yeah, thanks, Ray.
327	00:20:41	00:20:47	Greg's finishing up with the luminol inside, but so far, there's no evidence of any killing that took place here.
328	00:20:47	00:20:48	Let's check the garage.
329	00:21:03	00:21:05	It's frozen in time.
330	00:21:05	00:21:07	Just like the rest of the house.
331	00:21:07	00:21:08	Let's go to work.
332	00:21:22	00:21:25	The luminol's reacting with the detergent.
333	00:21:26	00:21:28	Yeah, and the bleach.
334	00:21:35	00:21:37	Nick.
335	00:21:37	00:21:38	Hmm?
336	00:21:38	00:21:43	I've got something over here, and it ain't bleach.
337	00:21:43	00:21:44	No, sir.
338	00:21:46	00:21:48	We need to get up there.
339	00:21:53	00:21:55	That's the stain that seeped through into the garage.
340	00:21:55	00:21:58	A trail of fluid leads back to...
341	00:21:58	00:22:00	this footlocker here.
342	00:22:00	00:22:03	U.S. Army standard issue.
343	00:22:04	00:22:09	A psychic told Janet that her son was dry but near water.
344	00:22:28	00:22:29	Oh.
345	00:22:39	00:22:42	Andy was wearing pajamas the night he disappeared.
346	00:22:45	00:22:47	Where exactly?
347	00:22:47	00:22:49	Have they recovered anything else?
348	00:22:49	00:22:51	Okay, keep me posted, Nick.
349	00:22:54	00:22:55	Jim, what is it?
350	00:22:56	00:22:59	What? Did they find something?
351	00:22:59	00:23:02	Tell me.
352	00:23:03	00:23:05	They found Andy's body.
353	00:23:07	00:23:09	At the house?
354	00:23:09	00:23:11	No.
355	00:23:11	00:23:14	Oh, he was with me all the time!
356	00:23:14	00:23:15	He was with me!
357	00:23:16	00:23:18	Come on. No! No! No!
358	00:23:40	00:23:42	You know, Doc...
359	00:23:44	00:23:46	I'm against the death penalty...
360	00:23:47	00:23:49	...except when it comes to people who kill children.
361	00:23:49	00:23:55	I think they should be tortured first and then guillotined.
362	00:23:55	00:24:00	Every layer of friction ridged skin was eaten away by bugs, so I can't get prints.
363	00:24:00	00:24:03	Tissue sample should be able to confirm his identity through DNA.
364	00:24:03	00:24:06	Well, I confirmed the remains as male.
365	00:24:06	00:24:08	Femur measured 11 inches.
366	00:24:08	00:24:10	That's consistent with an average nine-year-old.
367	00:24:10	00:24:15	The decay was consistent with a boy who's been dead approximately three years.
368	00:24:15	00:24:16	What about C.O.D.?
369	00:24:16	00:24:19	Blunt force trauma to the temporal bone.
370	00:24:19	00:24:21	Single blow? As far as I can tell.
371	00:24:21	00:24:26	The wound appears compatible of an object the size and shape of that flashlight I saw.
372	00:24:26	00:24:30	And there were bone fragments inside what was left his brain.
373	00:24:34	00:24:38	I can't tell you what Andy was feeling in the final moments of his life...
374	00:24:39	00:24:41	...but I do know he didn't suffer long.
375	00:24:41	00:24:44	He shouldn't have suffered at all.
376	00:24:48	00:24:50	Her son's body was found in her garage.
377	00:24:50	00:24:51	She was in possession of the murder weapon.
378	00:24:51	00:24:53	That makes Janet Marsh suspect number one.
379	00:24:53	00:24:54	We're taking her into custody, Jim.
380	00:24:54	00:24:56	The woman has been through hell.
381	00:24:56	00:25:00	She just found out that she's been living with her kid's corpse.
382	00:25:00	00:25:02	Yeah, a corpse that was never in her husband's vehicle.
383	00:25:02	00:25:06	Which means that her son's bloody pajama top was planted there, which brings us back to your friend Janet.
384	00:25:06	00:25:08	She didn't kill her family.
385	00:25:08	00:25:11	Jim, I know you're trying to do your job, but you have a personal relationship with this woman.
386	00:25:11	00:25:13	Okay?
387	00:25:13	00:25:14	And that's not going to look good.
388	00:25:14	00:25:16	Don't go there, Conrad, okay?
389	00:25:16	00:25:18	Jim, we're going to do this by the book.
390	00:25:18	00:25:20	I'm not taking you off the case, but I want to interview her.
391	00:25:20	00:25:21	She knows me. She trusts me.
392	00:25:21	00:25:25	Let's just see what she'll say when she's talking to someone she doesn't know.
393	00:25:26	00:25:28	Mrs. Marsh, my name's Conrad Ecklie.
394	00:25:29	00:25:30	I'm the undersheriff.
395	00:25:30	00:25:32	We need to ask you some questions.
396	00:25:34	00:25:37	First, I need to make sure this waiver of attorney we have on file still applies.
397	00:25:37	00:25:39	Do you waive your right to have an attorney present?
398	00:25:40	00:25:41	Yes or no, please? Yes.
399	00:25:41	00:25:44	I waive my right to have an attorney present.
400	00:25:44	00:25:47	Janet, you remember me, yeah?
401	00:25:47	00:25:49	We've talked before. Yes.
402	00:25:49	00:25:52	Guess we'll talk a little bit again here.
403	00:25:52	00:25:58	Um, what can you tell me about the footlocker in the crawl space above the garage?
404	00:25:58	00:26:01	Oh, my God.
405	00:26:01	00:26:03	Was he in there?
406	00:26:05	00:26:07	Stay with me now, Janet.
407	00:26:09	00:26:10	How long has it been there?
408	00:26:10	00:26:14	Since Mike got back from Desert Storm.
409	00:26:14	00:26:16	So it was your husband's footlocker?
410	00:26:16	00:26:19	Yes.
411	00:26:19	00:26:23	But we kept Andy's camping stuff in it.
412	00:26:23	00:26:24	He loved to camp.
413	00:26:30	00:26:34	And how long has it been since you opened it?
414	00:26:36	00:26:41	We took a camping trip to Cathedral Gorge that summer.
415	00:26:41	00:26:43	The kids, Mike, Bill and me.
416	00:26:43	00:26:44	And Bill is...?
417	00:26:44	00:26:47	My brother.
418	00:26:47	00:26:49	He spent more time with the kids than their own father.
419	00:26:49	00:26:53	Taught Andy to fish.
420	00:26:53	00:27:01	Uh, Emily was being difficult, so I brought her home.
421	00:27:01	00:27:06	I'm pretty sure they put the locker away when they got back.
422	00:27:15	00:27:20	You think I killed my little boy?
423	00:27:20	00:27:22	My daughter? My husband?
424	00:27:25	00:27:32	I can't move because I'm afraid if they come back, they won't be able to find me.
425	00:27:33	00:27:37	I can't sleep, and so I go looking for them on the highway.
426	00:27:37	00:27:40	It's all I do!
427	00:27:40	00:27:43	Why can't you people understand that?
428	00:27:43	00:27:47	I hire psychics to help me, and then people think I'm crazy.
429	00:27:47	00:27:50	This is making me crazy!
430	00:27:50	00:27:54	And it's got to stop!
431	00:27:54	00:27:57	It's got to stop!
432	00:28:00	00:28:03	I collected 16 prints.
433	00:28:03	00:28:05	Six were identifiable.
434	00:28:05	00:28:08	Five were on the bottom panel of the footlocker.
435	00:28:08	00:28:10	Position suggests that someone was trying to pick it up.
436	00:28:11	00:28:14	All five were a match to Mike Marsh.
437	00:28:14	00:28:16	Identified by an old work card.
438	00:28:16	00:28:18	Construction contract at the Eclipse.
439	00:28:20	00:28:21	This one...
440	00:28:23	00:28:24	is unknown.
441	00:28:24	00:28:26	Did you check it against the brother?
442	00:28:26	00:28:30	Yes. Everyone's money is on Uncle Bill, but no match.
443	00:28:30	00:28:32	Print could belong to one of the kids.
444	00:28:32	00:28:35	David Phillips was unable to get any fingerprints off the boy's body.
445	00:28:35	00:28:38	And there were no exemplars from Andy or Emily in the file.
446	00:29:27	00:29:28	What made you collect this?
447	00:29:29	00:29:34	Emily's room was full of stuff that belonged to her, but this was actually a part of her.
448	00:29:44	00:29:45	No hit on your lid print.
449	00:29:45	00:29:48	It was a long-shot, but we had to play it.
450	00:29:53	00:29:54	Wait a sec.
451	00:29:55	00:29:57	That's impossible. There were no exemplars.
452	00:29:57	00:29:58	She can't be in AFIS.
453	00:29:58	00:30:00	What did Emily's print hit on?
454	00:30:00	00:30:05	Current work card-- Hope Wilson, Reno, Nevada.
455	00:30:05	00:30:08	Date of birth, September 2, 1992.
456	00:30:08	00:30:10	It's a different name, but it's the same birthday.
457	00:30:14	00:30:16	That is Emily Marsh.
458	00:30:24	00:30:26	Suspect's vehicle is approaching.
459	00:30:27	00:30:28	Let's go.
460	00:30:33	00:30:35	Emily Marsh, step out of the vehicle.
461	00:30:35	00:30:37	Emily Marsh?
462	00:30:37	00:30:38	My name is Hope Wilson.
463	00:30:38	00:30:40	Put your weapons away.
464	00:30:40	00:30:41	Mommy.
465	00:30:42	00:30:43	There's a child in the backseat.
466	00:30:43	00:30:44	Call Child Services.
467	00:30:44	00:30:46	Get an ambulance, get the kid back to Vegas.
468	00:30:46	00:30:48	Emily Marsh, you're under arrest. Come with me.
469	00:30:48	00:30:50	My name is Hope Wilson. Please don't hurt my son.
470	00:30:50	00:30:53	He'll be fine.
471	00:30:56	00:30:58	Oh, Conner, don't be sad.
472	00:30:58	00:31:00	Everything's cool.
473	00:31:00	00:31:03	Hey, I got something for you. You want to see?
474	00:31:06	00:31:07	Pick one.
475	00:31:07	00:31:08	Green.
476	00:31:08	00:31:10	Green?
477	00:31:10	00:31:11	Are you sure? The red's really good.
478	00:31:11	00:31:13	Uh-uh. I'll make you a deal.
479	00:31:13	00:31:17	You try the red one, and if you don't like it, I'll give you the green one.
480	00:31:17	00:31:19	Okay. Okay.
481	00:31:20	00:31:21	There you go.
482	00:31:24	00:31:26	(chuckles) You don't like it?
483	00:31:26	00:31:29	Okay. All right, the green one it is then.
484	00:31:29	00:31:30	There you go.
485	00:31:31	00:31:32	Good?
486	00:31:32	00:31:34	Good.
487	00:31:34	00:31:36	How old are you?
488	00:31:36	00:31:37	Three? No way.
489	00:31:39	00:31:40	You're a big boy.
490	00:31:40	00:31:42	You like that one?
491	00:31:42	00:31:44	I got to get me a green one.
492	00:31:44	00:31:47	We know who you are.
493	00:31:47	00:31:49	You're Emily Marsh.
494	00:31:49	00:31:53	Your fingerprints confirm it.
495	00:31:53	00:31:58	Emily, we've been looking for you for three years.
496	00:31:58	00:32:00	We're still looking for your father.
497	00:32:00	00:32:03	Can you tell me what happened?
498	00:32:08	00:32:12	I'm going to need to take your DNA to confirm you're the mother of Conner.
499	00:32:12	00:32:14	I am.
500	00:32:15	00:32:17	Who's the father?
501	00:32:26	00:32:28	Open up please.
502	00:32:37	00:32:38	How's it going in here, Ray?
503	00:32:38	00:32:46	Looks like we're back to square two. You know her neighbors in Reno said that Emily was living with her husband-- an older guy.
504	00:32:47	00:32:50	Conner's father, Doug Wilson.
505	00:32:50	00:32:54	D.O.B. September 14, 1967. Age...
506	00:32:54	00:32:55	Forty-three.
507	00:32:56	00:32:57	Mike Marsh would have been 43.
508	00:32:57	00:33:00	People on the run are desperate.
509	00:33:00	00:33:03	They're not thinking straight. They change their names, but they forget to change their date of birth.
510	00:33:13	00:33:14	Doug Wilson.
511	00:33:14	00:33:16	That's the same face.
512	00:33:16	00:33:20	Father and daughter living as husband and wife.
513	00:33:20	00:33:22	Connor was three.
514	00:33:22	00:33:25	Emily was pregnant before she disappeared.
515	00:33:25	00:33:27	Her father's the father.
516	00:33:27	00:33:30	I want to see Emily now.
517	00:33:30	00:33:32	It's gonna be a while.
518	00:33:32	00:33:33	We haven't finished talking to her yet.
519	00:33:34	00:33:36	Why? What's the matter?
520	00:33:36	00:33:37	Emily is safe.
521	00:33:37	00:33:40	So keep that in the front of your mind, okay?
522	00:33:40	00:33:45	But things are unraveling very quickly, and there've been some unexpected developments.
523	00:33:48	00:33:49	Mike is alive.
524	00:33:51	00:33:55	Emily has a child.
525	00:33:55	00:33:56	What?
526	00:33:57	00:33:58	He's three years old.
527	00:33:59	00:34:04	How...? No, no, that can't be.
528	00:34:04	00:34:05	How could that be?
529	00:34:05	00:34:06	Captain. Yeah?
530	00:34:06	00:34:08	There's a Doug Wilson at the Reception.
531	00:34:08	00:34:10	Wants to talk to you. Okay.
532	00:34:10	00:34:12	I'm gonna send someone home with you, okay?
533	00:34:12	00:34:14	And I'll call you later.
534	00:34:16	00:34:20	As soon as I take him to Interrogation, get her out of here.
535	00:34:20	00:34:22	Yeah.
536	00:34:22	00:34:24	Oh, my...
537	00:34:24	00:34:26	Oh, my God.
538	00:34:31	00:34:34	Mike Marsh.
539	00:34:35	00:34:36	Have you arrested him? Yes, Captain.
540	00:34:36	00:34:38	That's why I'm here.
541	00:34:38	00:34:41	I'm the guy you want, not my daughter.
542	00:34:41	00:34:43	Emily didn't do anything wrong.
543	00:34:43	00:34:45	We're gonna talk about that.
544	00:34:45	00:34:46	Let's go.
545	00:34:46	00:34:48	I made the decision to run!
546	00:34:48	00:34:49	I took her with me.
547	00:34:49	00:34:53	Let Emily and her son go! She didn't have anything to do with Andy's death!
548	00:34:53	00:34:55	I killed him! It was an accident.
549	00:34:55	00:34:56	It was all me.
550	00:34:56	00:34:58	Did you hear what I said?
551	00:34:58	00:34:59	It was all my fault.
552	00:35:00	00:35:01	I killed my son.
553	00:35:03	00:35:05	You sick bastard!
554	00:35:06	00:35:08	You were supposed to protect our children!
555	00:35:09	00:35:10	Get down!
556	00:35:29	00:35:30	Dad?
557	00:35:38	00:35:39	Dad!
558	00:35:39	00:35:42	Daddy!
559	00:35:43	00:35:47	Daddy! (sobbing)
560	00:35:47	00:35:49	Daddy, what happened?
561	00:35:50	00:35:52	What happened? Daddy.
562	00:35:52	00:35:53	No!
563	00:36:01	00:36:06	A man murders his son, impregnates his daughter.
564	00:36:06	00:36:07	Why turn yourself in?
565	00:36:07	00:36:10	I mean, he ran once, why not run again?
566	00:36:10	00:36:15	Maybe he thought, in his own sick, twisted way, that he was really in love with her.
567	00:36:16	00:36:20	And then he found out that she and their son we're in custody?
568	00:36:20	00:36:22	He wanted to protect the both of them.
569	00:36:23	00:36:25	DNA results on Connor Wilson came back.
570	00:36:25	00:36:28	He shares more than 20 alleles with Emily.
571	00:36:28	00:36:30	Because Connor's mother and father were father and daughter.
572	00:36:31	00:36:33	The extra alleles come from the maternal DNA.
573	00:36:33	00:36:35	Say again?
574	00:36:35	00:36:39	Mike Marsh is not Connor Wilson's father.
575	00:36:39	00:36:42	His father shares seven alleles with Janet Marsh.
576	00:36:42	00:36:43	Janet's brother?
577	00:36:43	00:36:45	Uncle Bill.
578	00:36:45	00:36:50	I told my mom I didn't want Uncle Bill to come over anymore.
579	00:36:50	00:36:56	She said I was ungrateful, and it was her house.
580	00:36:56	00:36:59	This whole thing is her fault!
581	00:36:59	00:37:01	Everything is her fault!
582	00:37:01	00:37:04	When did your dad find out?
583	00:37:07	00:37:09	That night.
584	00:37:09	00:37:12	My dad was still at work.
585	00:37:12	00:37:14	Uncle Bill let himself in.
586	00:37:14	00:37:20	I thought since I was pregnant, he would leave me alone, but he didn't.
587	00:37:22	00:37:24	Andy should've been in bed.
588	00:37:49	00:37:53	When Uncle Bill left, I went to find Andy.
589	00:37:53	00:37:55	I didn't even know what to say.
590	00:37:55	00:37:57	But the way he looked at me...
591	00:37:57	00:38:02	He started yelling, I'm gonna tell Mom! I'm gonna tell Mom!
592	00:38:02	00:38:03	I'm gonna tell Mom!
593	00:38:04	00:38:06	She would have blamed me!
594	00:38:07	00:38:09	I just wanted him to shut up!
595	00:38:09	00:38:11	I'm gonna tell Mom! I'm gonna tell Mom!
596	00:38:11	00:38:13	Quit it! You're not gonna tell Mom!
597	00:38:13	00:38:16	Yes, I am! Get that thing out of my face!
598	00:38:16	00:38:17	You're gonna be in so much trouble!
599	00:38:17	00:38:19	Shut up!
600	00:38:21	00:38:25	When my dad came home and found us, I told him everything.
601	00:38:27	00:38:28	Emmy, what happened?
602	00:38:30	00:38:32	I'm sorry.
603	00:38:32	00:38:38	He said it wasn't my fault, that he'd make it all better.
604	00:38:39	00:38:43	My dad said we'd come back someday and bury him.
605	00:38:48	00:38:50	My dad was just trying to protect me.
606	00:38:50	00:38:52	He didn't do anything wrong.
607	00:39:05	00:39:08	I loved my brother.
608	00:39:15	00:39:16	I'm sorry.
609	00:39:16	00:39:18	I'm so sorry!
610	00:39:27	00:39:30	The D.A. has decided not to file charges against Emily.
611	00:39:30	00:39:34	She'll be a much better mother than I ever was.
612	00:39:34	00:39:38	I never could talk with Emily...
613	00:39:38	00:39:41	even when she was little.
614	00:39:41	00:39:43	Andy was different.
615	00:39:43	00:39:46	He was so easy to love.
616	00:39:48	00:39:53	This all happened because they knew I could never forgive her.
617	00:39:56	00:40:01	I hope one day she can learn to forgive me.
618	00:40:05	00:40:07	Okay.
619	00:41:09	00:41:10	Okay, there's your mom.
620	00:41:10	00:41:12	It's time to go.
621	00:41:12	00:41:14	But before you leave, how about...
622	00:41:14	00:41:16	a green one for the road?
623	00:41:17	00:41:19	All right, you're a good boy.
624	00:41:19	00:41:21	Go on, you little CSI. Mom!
625	00:41:21	00:41:23	Hey.
626	00:41:23	00:41:25	Hi. Mommy.
627	00:41:25	00:41:26	How are you?
628	00:41:26	00:41:27	Are you okay? Yeah.
629	00:41:27	00:41:28	Yeah?
630	00:41:29	00:41:31	I missed you.
631	00:41:31	00:41:34	Let me see you.
