0	00:00:21	00:00:22	My name is Royce Harmon.
1	00:00:22	00:00:27	I reside at 7642 Carpenter Street, Las Vegas, Nevada.
2	00:00:27	00:00:30	I am 41 years of age...
3	00:00:30	00:00:33	...and I'm going to kill myself.
4	00:00:35	00:00:40	I'd like to say I love you to my mother Paige and my sister Gina.
5	00:00:40	00:00:42	I'm so sorry.
6	00:00:42	00:00:44	I never wanted to put you through this.
7	00:00:44	00:00:47	I just can't do it anymore.
8	00:00:47	00:00:48	I love you, Mom...
9	00:00:58	00:01:00	Here comes the nerd squad.
10	00:01:00	00:01:02	I hate the legwork.
11	00:01:02	00:01:06	I'm telling you, that Deputy Chief job better come in soon.
12	00:01:06	00:01:10	I don't know how much longer I can put up with these damn public appearances.
13	00:01:12	00:01:13	Gentlemen...
14	00:01:13	00:01:14	Hey, guys, take a break, huh?
15	00:01:37	00:01:39	Suicide.
16	00:01:39	00:01:40	You think so, huh?
17	00:01:40	00:01:46	You got the sleeping bag for easy cleanup the bathtub to catch the bullet open window so the stench alerts the neighbors...
18	00:01:46	00:01:48	God bless him.
19	00:01:53	00:01:55	Oh, geez...
20	00:02:06	00:02:08	Pupa, stage three.
21	00:02:08	00:02:10	English. I'm not an entomologist.
22	00:02:11	00:02:14	It's the third stage of larva metamorphosis.
23	00:02:14	00:02:16	This guy's been dead seven days.
24	00:02:16	00:02:19	That's a maggot, and he stinks.
25	00:02:19	00:02:20	00.
26	00:02:21	00:02:26	Maybe if I'm lucky I can break out of here in time for a shot at the first rack of the Krispy Kreme.
27	00:02:29	00:02:31	I think we may have our suicide note.
28	00:02:33	00:02:36	I never wanted to put you through this.
29	00:02:36	00:02:37	I just can't do it anymore.
30	00:02:37	00:02:39	I've lost hope.
31	00:02:39	00:02:41	I love you, Mom...
32	00:02:43	00:02:44	Oh, my God!
33	00:02:44	00:02:46	Go upstairs, Gina.
34	00:02:47	00:02:50	This can't be happening.
35	00:02:50	00:02:52	We're so sorry about this, Ms. Harmon.
36	00:02:52	00:02:55	I can only imagine how difficult this must be for you.
37	00:02:55	00:02:59	No, you don't understand.
38	00:02:59	00:03:01	This is his picture...
39	00:03:02	00:03:05	but that's not my son's voice.
40	00:04:04	00:04:05	Hello?
41	00:04:06	00:04:08	Ooh...
42	00:04:08	00:04:10	My God.
43	00:04:24	00:04:25	Hi.
44	00:04:27	00:04:28	Sorry.
45	00:04:28	00:04:29	Welcome to Forensics.
46	00:04:29	00:04:32	Gil Grissom. I'm your supervisor on graveyard.
47	00:04:32	00:04:33	Holly Gribbs.
48	00:04:34	00:04:35	Nice office.
49	00:04:35	00:04:40	Thanks. Would you mind taking off your jacket and rolling up your sleeve?
50	00:04:40	00:04:41	For what?
51	00:04:41	00:04:43	I need a pint of your blood.
52	00:04:43	00:04:45	It's customary for all new hires.
53	00:04:45	00:04:46	Why?
54	00:04:46	00:04:48	So many reasons.
55	00:04:49	00:04:52	I-I haven't even clocked in yet.
56	00:04:53	00:04:59	Attention, Command One more, baby, one more.
57	00:04:59	00:05:00	Hey.
58	00:05:00	00:05:02	There he is. What's up?
59	00:05:04	00:05:09	99. You and me, dead heat.
60	00:05:09	00:05:12	Next crime solved gets promoted to CSI III, man.
61	00:05:13	00:05:20	Yeah, yeah, choice of shift, $8,000 raise extra week vacation-- oh-ho, it's all about Cabo, bro.
62	00:05:20	00:05:24	Twenty bucks, by the end of shift, I'm the man.
63	00:05:24	00:05:26	Is there anything you won't bet on? Nah.
64	00:05:26	00:05:28	It's college football season, man.
65	00:05:28	00:05:30	I won eight of ten this weekend.
66	00:05:30	00:05:35	Kilt 'em. Outside the Huskers and them punk-ass Irish I'm up about four G's.
67	00:05:35	00:05:37	Hmm, what's the line on us?
68	00:05:37	00:05:39	On us?
69	00:05:39	00:05:42	I'm like Tiger, man-- I'm heavily favored.
70	00:05:42	00:05:45	Come on, give me a winner for tomorrow.
71	00:05:45	00:05:49	Ah... Green Bay, minus seven and a half over Niners.
72	00:05:49	00:05:52	Always go with the better quarterback.
73	00:05:52	00:05:53	Uh-huh.
74	00:05:53	00:05:57	Cool. Hey, good luck tonight, man.
75	00:05:57	00:05:59	Thanks. You, too, Nick.
76	00:06:00	00:06:01	I hope you get that trick roll noise.
77	00:06:01	00:06:03	You'll never crack that in a shift, never.
78	00:06:03	00:06:09	Yeah, well, we'll see, and I hope the Pack wins by seven.
79	00:06:09	00:06:14	We scrutinize the crime scene, collect the evidence recreate what happened without ever having been there.
80	00:06:14	00:06:16	Pretty cool, actually.
81	00:06:16	00:06:19	I just got out of the Academy-- I already know this.
82	00:06:19	00:06:20	Of course you do.
83	00:06:20	00:06:28	Then if you'll just sign these waivers for personal injury or death while in the line of duty, we can begin our shift.
84	00:06:29	00:06:31	Mmm...
85	00:06:31	00:06:32	What's the matter?
86	00:06:32	00:06:34	Um... I'm kind of light-headed.
87	00:06:34	00:06:35	Sit down, sit down.
88	00:06:35	00:06:37	You're probably low on blood sugar.
89	00:06:37	00:06:39	I've got just the thing.
90	00:06:41	00:06:43	Here, try one of these.
91	00:06:43	00:06:49	No offense, but I don't think I want to eat anything that's been in this office.
92	00:06:59	00:07:01	Is there a grasshopper in here?
93	00:07:06	00:07:08	When we get some free time, try and catch up on your reports.
94	00:07:08	00:07:10	I'm getting a lot of heat from the Sheriff's Office.
95	00:07:10	00:07:11	There I said it.
96	00:07:11	00:07:13	Administration, not my favorite thing.
97	00:07:13	00:07:15	All right, here we go.
98	00:07:15	00:07:17	Nick Stokes, 414, trick roll.
99	00:07:17	00:07:19	Victim found drugged and robbed at the scene.
100	00:07:19	00:07:22	Warrick Brown, 407, home invasion, forced entry.
101	00:07:22	00:07:26	Person reporting crime fired multiple rounds at the suspect.
102	00:07:26	00:07:28	Suspect's condition is unknown.
103	00:07:30	00:07:31	Anyone seen Catherine Willows?
104	00:07:35	00:07:37	Okay, give me a kiss.
105	00:07:37	00:07:39	Mommy's got to go catch some bad guys.
106	00:07:39	00:07:41	I'll pick her up in the morning.
107	00:07:41	00:07:43	Bye, sis. Bye.
108	00:07:43	00:07:44	I love you!
109	00:07:47	00:07:51	So your mother is Lieutenant Jane Gribbs from Traffic, is that right?
110	00:07:51	00:07:52	Yes, sir.
111	00:07:52	00:07:54	Well, congratulations, Gribbs.
112	00:07:54	00:07:55	You're the...
113	00:07:55	00:07:59	You're the fifth person I've been forced to hire.
114	00:07:59	00:08:00	We're the number two crime lab in the country.
115	00:08:00	00:08:03	We solve crimes most labs render unsolvable.
116	00:08:03	00:08:05	Now what makes you think you belong here?
117	00:08:06	00:08:15	Sir, with all due respect I thought the key to being a lucid crime scene investigator was to reserve judgment until the evidence vindicates or eliminates assumption.
118	00:08:16	00:08:17	You're prejudging me.
119	00:08:17	00:08:20	I graduated with honors in criminal justice at UNLV.
120	00:08:21	00:08:21	Yeah, so?
121	00:08:22	00:08:22	That's not fair.
122	00:08:22	00:08:27	Fair? Well, you think putting a juiced-in lieutenant's daughter on this shift is fair?
123	00:08:27	00:08:28	You know, I've been in the field 22 years.
124	00:08:28	00:08:29	I've seen it all.
125	00:08:29	00:08:32	I've seen people like you come and go, and you know what?
126	00:08:32	00:08:35	They're nothing but headaches and bad press.
127	00:08:37	00:08:39	Dismissed.
128	00:08:40	00:08:42	Fine.
129	00:08:46	00:08:48	Think you got through to her?
130	00:08:48	00:08:50	30 a.m.
131	00:08:50	00:08:52	They're cutting up that bozo put a hole in his chest.
132	00:08:52	00:08:54	Take her with.
133	00:08:54	00:08:58	I think every new hire should experience an autopsy on their first night.
134	00:09:28	00:09:30	It's okay, shh.
135	00:09:31	00:09:33	Ma'am...
136	00:09:33	00:09:34	are you all right?
137	00:09:34	00:09:35	She's fine.
138	00:09:35	00:09:37	She's just a little shook up is all.
139	00:09:37	00:09:39	Somebody want to tell us what happened here tonight?
140	00:09:39	00:09:45	My wife invited her drunk friend to stay here so he could get back on his feet.
141	00:09:45	00:09:47	Two weeks tops, she says.
142	00:09:47	00:09:50	That was six months ago.
143	00:09:52	00:09:53	Jimmy, Jimmy!
144	00:09:53	00:09:56	Please take your sweaty feet off the head pillow.
145	00:09:56	00:09:58	They stink.
146	00:10:05	00:10:08	Here's a 20-- twice as much as you came with. Hit the road.
147	00:10:10	00:10:11	Open up!
148	00:10:22	00:10:23	Call 911.
149	00:10:25	00:10:26	That was it.
150	00:10:26	00:10:29	I feared for my wife and my baby.
151	00:10:31	00:10:34	Let's put the baby to bed.
152	00:10:38	00:10:40	What do you think?
153	00:10:40	00:10:42	Oh, he's lying. That's why I took this job.
154	00:10:42	00:10:45	I can always tell when whitey's talking out his ass.
155	00:10:45	00:10:46	It's a gift.
156	00:10:46	00:10:48	It's also your 100th.
157	00:10:48	00:10:51	Yeah, that, too.
158	00:10:51	00:10:54	So tonight you might say I'm extra suspicious.
159	00:10:56	00:10:58	Why don't you print that tread and see how good you are?
160	00:11:13	00:11:15	Why are you doing that?
161	00:11:15	00:11:16	It's just procedure, sir.
162	00:11:16	00:11:21	We just want to make sure the shoe on the suspect is the same shoe that kicked down your door.
163	00:11:21	00:11:23	Wait... Wait a minute.
164	00:11:23	00:11:24	What's the matter?
165	00:11:24	00:11:31	Sir, after you shot the deceased, did you move re-dress, or alter the body in any way?
166	00:11:31	00:11:33	No, why?
167	00:11:33	00:11:34	Talk to me.
168	00:11:34	00:11:36	The left shoe's tied differently.
169	00:11:36	00:11:41	Sir, in the six months that the victim lived with you did you ever wear his shoes?
170	00:11:41	00:11:43	No, why would I do that?
171	00:11:43	00:11:46	You willing to sign a statement to that effect?
172	00:11:46	00:11:47	Sure.
173	00:11:48	00:11:52	Sir, what happened to your pinkie toe?
174	00:11:53	00:11:55	I tripped over a rattle.
175	00:12:00	00:12:02	You got to breathe through your ears, Gribbs.
176	00:12:02	00:12:04	First dead body, ma'am?
177	00:12:04	00:12:06	Yes, sir, but I'll be okay.
178	00:12:06	00:12:08	To tell you the truth, he looks fake.
179	00:12:08	00:12:14	I hate to put a damper on your night, Grissom but it looks like we got ourselves a homicide after all.
180	00:12:14	00:12:17	You see, if the victim had extended his arms like...
181	00:12:18	00:12:19	Here, I'll show you. Give me your hands.
182	00:12:19	00:12:22	And pushed the trigger with his thumbs, like so...
183	00:12:24	00:12:26	The wound would look like this.
184	00:12:26	00:12:27	He's right, honey.
185	00:12:27	00:12:28	This wound's too big.
186	00:12:29	00:12:32	This person was shot from six to seven feet away.
187	00:12:32	00:12:35	It's like somebody stood over him and, bam!
188	00:12:37	00:12:38	Criminal homicide.
189	00:12:38	00:12:41	Let's see what God would have to say.
190	00:12:46	00:12:47	Are you okay?
191	00:12:47	00:12:48	I'm sorry, sir.
192	00:12:48	00:12:50	I can't take the smell.
193	00:12:50	00:12:52	Oh, God, restroom?
194	00:12:52	00:12:54	Right down the hall to your right.
195	00:12:56	00:12:58	She is cute.
196	00:13:22	00:13:25	How soon does the Captain want that one out?
197	00:13:25	00:13:27	Eight hours.
198	00:13:27	00:13:29	Whoo!
199	00:13:35	00:13:37	Help! Help me!
200	00:13:41	00:13:43	There were bodies.
201	00:13:43	00:13:45	I could feel them breathing.
202	00:13:46	00:13:47	Oh, God!
203	00:13:47	00:13:49	It's okay, Holly, it's all right.
204	00:13:52	00:13:54	You assholes!!
205	00:13:55	00:13:57	There.
206	00:13:57	00:13:58	Okay?
207	00:14:11	00:14:12	What's up, fellas?
208	00:14:12	00:14:14	We got a call about a trick roll.
209	00:14:14	00:14:15	Right there. Room 1413.
210	00:14:20	00:14:22	Hey.
211	00:14:24	00:14:26	Mr. Laferty?
212	00:14:26	00:14:29	Well, what's left of him, anyway.
213	00:14:31	00:14:34	I'm Nick Stokes, with Criminalistics.
214	00:14:34	00:14:36	You mind if I ask you a few questions?
215	00:14:36	00:14:39	She got everything-- my wallet, my ID...
216	00:14:39	00:14:41	Hell, she even got my wedding ring.
217	00:14:41	00:14:43	Did you two have a nightcap?
218	00:14:43	00:14:45	You think she could've slipped you something?
219	00:14:45	00:14:47	Nah, I can't drink. I got this bum ticker.
220	00:14:47	00:14:49	Look, Officer, I...
221	00:14:49	00:14:50	Nick.
222	00:14:50	00:14:53	You can call me Nick.
223	00:14:53	00:14:55	Nick, I...
224	00:14:55	00:14:57	I love my wife.
225	00:14:57	00:14:59	We've been married 31 years now.
226	00:14:59	00:15:01	I've never cheated on her before.
227	00:15:01	00:15:09	I come into town for this convention and I'm setting in the lounge minding my own business, when this...
228	00:15:09	00:15:12	sweet-smelling brunette came up to me and...
229	00:15:13	00:15:16	Next thing I know, she's nibbling on my earlobe and...
230	00:15:22	00:15:24	Well, my goodness. Look at you.
231	00:15:32	00:15:36	For a second there, I thought I was your age again.
232	00:15:36	00:15:39	We've been seeing more and more of these the past 48 hours.
233	00:15:39	00:15:41	Let's take a look.
234	00:15:41	00:15:43	Open your eyes wide for me.
235	00:15:43	00:15:45	Sunny side up.
236	00:15:48	00:15:49	Now say ah.
237	00:15:49	00:15:51	Ah.
238	00:15:51	00:15:52	Was she hot?
239	00:15:54	00:15:55	Attaboy.
240	00:15:55	00:16:01	Mr. Laferty, your eyes look okay but I notice some discoloration around the inside of your lips.
241	00:16:01	00:16:03	Have you always had that?
242	00:16:03	00:16:05	No. What the hell is that?
243	00:16:05	00:16:10	I'll swab your gums see if we can find out what made you pass out.
244	00:16:15	00:16:18	You know, my first robbery solved was a store like this.
245	00:16:18	00:16:23	When we caught the guy, the owner was so happy that he gave me a dozen farm fresh eggs out of his cooler.
246	00:16:23	00:16:25	You're trying to cheer me up, aren't you?
247	00:16:25	00:16:27	Yes, I am. How am I doing?
248	00:16:27	00:16:29	Pretty good.
249	00:16:29	00:16:30	Good.
250	00:16:30	00:16:33	Okay, look, this was a routine robbery.
251	00:16:33	00:16:36	Dust for prints, check the videotape take lots of fun photos.
252	00:16:36	00:16:39	I'll be back in about an hour to pick you up.
253	00:16:39	00:16:41	Okay.
254	00:16:41	00:16:45	If you get done early use channel seven on your walkie.
255	00:16:52	00:16:53	What's up?
256	00:16:53	00:16:55	Hey, rookie.
257	00:16:55	00:16:57	Hair fibers from the home invasion.
258	00:16:57	00:16:58	Take a look.
259	00:16:58	00:17:00	Tell me what you see.
260	00:17:04	00:17:06	I see a lot of things.
261	00:17:06	00:17:08	Look at the end of the follicles.
262	00:17:09	00:17:14	Oh, yeah, you know, I see, like little tiny seeds or sacs or something.
263	00:17:14	00:17:17	That's pulp when the human hair is yanked out like this.
264	00:17:17	00:17:19	Ow! Damn, man.
265	00:17:19	00:17:21	Look, you see the seeds?
266	00:17:21	00:17:27	Hair only comes out in that form when it's yanked or pulled signifying a struggle.
267	00:17:27	00:17:29	You know what? I got to go.
268	00:17:29	00:17:33	Tell Grissom, when he gets back I went to Homicide to do a follow-up on the husband.
269	00:17:33	00:17:34	Peace.
270	00:17:34	00:17:35	Yeah.
271	00:17:35	00:17:38	Now, how long is this gonna take?
272	00:17:38	00:17:42	I'm losing business because of you.
273	00:17:42	00:17:45	Ma'am, I told you, if you let them in it will contaminate the scene.
274	00:17:45	00:17:46	Oh, contaminate, my ass!
275	00:17:46	00:17:48	What the hell difference does it make?
276	00:17:48	00:17:50	You ain't gonna catch 'em.
277	00:17:50	00:17:52	You never do.
278	00:17:52	00:17:54	Sir, I'm on your side.
279	00:17:54	00:17:57	I just want to clear you.
280	00:17:57	00:17:59	Then clear me. I already told you everything.
281	00:17:59	00:18:00	I understand that.
282	00:18:00	00:18:02	The evidence tells us something different.
283	00:18:02	00:18:09	So I'm going to ask you again, just one more time-- before you shot the deceased did a struggle ensue?
284	00:18:11	00:18:12	I've got a gun.
285	00:18:13	00:18:14	What are you doing?
286	00:18:18	00:18:20	Call 911.
287	00:18:29	00:18:33	I must've tied the laces wrong.
288	00:18:33	00:18:37	I'm sorry, I...
289	00:18:37	00:18:39	I know I should've told you earlier but...
290	00:18:39	00:18:41	I was nervous.
291	00:18:41	00:18:43	I mean...
292	00:18:43	00:18:47	I took a man's life here.
293	00:18:49	00:18:52	You don't believe me, do you?
294	00:18:53	00:18:58	This is Holly Gribbs requesting backup at Junk's on West Owens, over.
295	00:18:58	00:19:00	This is Catherine Willows. Are you in danger?
296	00:19:00	00:19:03	Uh, we're getting there.
297	00:19:03	00:19:07	This is my popsicle stand-- I'll defend it to the hilt if I have to!
298	00:19:07	00:19:09	So, this is it, huh?
299	00:19:09	00:19:11	The $8,000 Q-Tip.
300	00:19:11	00:19:14	Well, you're the chemist.
301	00:19:14	00:19:16	I just need to know what knocked the old man out.
302	00:19:16	00:19:21	In 20 seconds, this'll give us a complete chemical breakdown right down to the atom.
303	00:19:21	00:19:26	But I'm going to warn you, though These mouth swabs don't always read.
304	00:19:27	00:19:29	Vaginal swabs, no problem.
305	00:19:29	00:19:32	Anal swabs-- money.
306	00:19:32	00:19:33	Anal swabs?
307	00:19:33	00:19:34	Anal swabs.
308	00:19:34	00:19:38	Ouch.
309	00:19:45	00:19:47	Dude, you get NFL-2K for Dreamcast?
310	00:19:47	00:19:49	Yeah. Bought it the day it came out.
311	00:19:49	00:19:52	Those graphics are killer, aren't they?
312	00:19:52	00:19:53	My team's the Falcons.
313	00:19:53	00:19:54	Who do you use?
314	00:19:54	00:19:56	Randy Moss.
315	00:20:02	00:20:04	It didn't take, did it?
316	00:20:04	00:20:06	A hint of saliva; some denture adhesive...
317	00:20:06	00:20:08	That's it.
318	00:20:08	00:20:11	Sorry, man.
319	00:20:12	00:20:14	All right, put the gun down.
320	00:20:14	00:20:15	What?
321	00:20:15	00:20:17	We're getting robbed again now?
322	00:20:17	00:20:18	Everything okay here?
323	00:20:19	00:20:20	Yes, ma'am.
324	00:20:21	00:20:23	Control, Junk's is a Code Four.
325	00:20:23	00:20:25	Copy that.
326	00:20:25	00:20:26	You the new girl?
327	00:20:26	00:20:28	Yeah. Hi, I'm Holly Gribbs.
328	00:20:28	00:20:30	Thanks. I'm Catherine Willows.
329	00:20:30	00:20:31	And I'm Lesley Stahl.
330	00:20:31	00:20:33	Look, let's forget the formalities.
331	00:20:33	00:20:35	Which one of you people's gonna clean my counter here?
332	00:20:35	00:20:40	Let me tell you something, lady-- if you don't care about catching the suspect neither do we.
333	00:20:40	00:20:41	We're out of here.
334	00:20:41	00:20:43	You can pick your gun up tomorrow.
335	00:20:43	00:20:45	You can do that?
336	00:20:45	00:20:47	No.
337	00:20:49	00:20:51	Ow!
338	00:20:53	00:20:55	Damn!
339	00:20:55	00:20:56	Blunt force trauma case.
340	00:20:56	00:20:58	Bermuda Hills Country Club.
341	00:20:58	00:21:02	Pregnant wife caught her husband in bed with another girl.
342	00:21:02	00:21:05	What do you think? Malicious intent?
343	00:21:05	00:21:06	Little bit, yeah. ( camera clicks )
344	00:21:06	00:21:08	How's it coming?
345	00:21:08	00:21:09	It's coming.
346	00:21:11	00:21:13	Whose blood is that?
347	00:21:13	00:21:14	The new girl's.
348	00:21:14	00:21:15	Would you like to donate?
349	00:21:15	00:21:17	Hell, no.
350	00:21:17	00:21:19	How'd the follow-up go with the husband?
351	00:21:19	00:21:22	Boe tells me you were onto something.
352	00:21:22	00:21:23	The story's changed a bit.
353	00:21:23	00:21:25	Now he says there was a struggle.
354	00:21:25	00:21:28	Said he stepped on his shoe while they were fighting.
355	00:21:28	00:21:29	You believe him?
356	00:21:29	00:21:33	At first, no but now...
357	00:21:33	00:21:35	Hell, I don't know what to think.
358	00:21:35	00:21:37	You ever see the movie The Exorcist?
359	00:21:37	00:21:39	Yeah.
360	00:21:39	00:21:43	The old priest and Father Karras are about to exorcise the demon.
361	00:21:43	00:21:51	Father Karras explains that he's recorded the little girl's voice and he's broken down the spirit into three distinct personalities.
362	00:21:51	00:21:58	But the old priest quickly corrects him-- There is only one.
363	00:21:58	00:22:00	Forget about the husband, Warrick.
364	00:22:00	00:22:02	Forget about the assumptions.
365	00:22:02	00:22:04	Forget about your promotion.
366	00:22:04	00:22:06	These things will only confuse you.
367	00:22:06	00:22:11	Concentrate on what cannot lie-- the evidence.
368	00:22:11	00:22:14	Follow...
369	00:22:14	00:22:16	the reason we're having this conversation.
370	00:22:18	00:22:21	Follow the shoe.
371	00:22:59	00:23:00	Well, I'll be damned.
372	00:23:08	00:23:11	Tripped over a rattle, my ass.
373	00:23:13	00:23:15	Remember this from your suicide case?
374	00:23:15	00:23:17	Minute I pulled it, I knew something wasn't right.
375	00:23:18	00:23:21	The impression's perfect-- maybe too perfect.
376	00:23:23	00:23:25	Take a gander.
377	00:23:29	00:23:32	What are those red particles?
378	00:23:32	00:23:33	Latex flakes.
379	00:23:33	00:23:35	From what?
380	00:23:35	00:23:42	Protective gloves, maybe but the way I figure it, this son of a bitch is smart-- probably planted the damn prints.
381	00:23:42	00:23:44	So on a hunch, I chemically tested the flakes.
382	00:23:44	00:23:46	Guess what it was laced with?
383	00:23:46	00:23:47	Lecithin.
384	00:23:47	00:23:51	That chemical's found in cooking spray isn't it?
385	00:23:51	00:23:57	If latex rubber and cooking spray went on a blind date, how would the night end?
386	00:23:57	00:23:58	A lot better than ours did.
387	00:23:58	00:24:02	I know, Pink Floyd's not your thing.
388	00:24:02	00:24:03	I have on cowboy boots.
389	00:24:03	00:24:05	I work in a lab.
390	00:24:05	00:24:11	What makes you think Dark Side of the Moon synched to The Wizard of Oz is going to warm my damn barn?
391	00:24:11	00:24:13	I just thought it'd be something different.
392	00:24:13	00:24:14	You want to be different?
393	00:24:14	00:24:17	Pin me up against a wall; lay one on me like you mean it.
394	00:24:21	00:24:22	You're slacking, pal.
395	00:24:29	00:24:30	How long till we get a hit?
396	00:24:30	00:24:35	It could be four minutes, could be four days but you can bet your ass she'll give you something.
397	00:24:35	00:24:37	She always does.
398	00:24:38	00:24:40	Pin you against a wall?
399	00:24:44	00:24:48	Look, um, I got to be honest.
400	00:24:49	00:24:51	This isn't me.
401	00:24:51	00:24:55	I was pushed into it by my mom.
402	00:24:55	00:24:57	She's a lieutenant in Traffic.
403	00:24:57	00:25:04	She's never going to get out of Traffic. so, um-- I'm fulfilling her dreams, not mine.
404	00:25:04	00:25:12	I can sit here and I can baby you and I can tell you to quit but I'm not going to do that, because I really love my job.
405	00:25:12	00:25:16	We're just a bunch of kids that are getting paid to work on puzzles.
406	00:25:17	00:25:19	Sometimes there's a piece that's missing.
407	00:25:19	00:25:22	Sometimes we solve it in one night.
408	00:25:23	00:25:25	So you think I should stick with it?
409	00:25:25	00:25:27	Stick with it?
410	00:25:27	00:25:29	The cops?
411	00:25:29	00:25:31	Forget it.
412	00:25:31	00:25:36	They wouldn't know fingerprints from paw prints and the detectives...
413	00:25:36	00:25:37	chase the lie.
414	00:25:38	00:25:44	We solve. We restore peace of mind and when you're a victim, that's everything.
415	00:25:45	00:25:47	Stick with it.
416	00:25:47	00:25:52	At least until you solve your first and if after that you don't feel like King Kong on cocaine...
417	00:25:52	00:26:00	then you can quit but if you stay with it my hand to God, you will never regret it.
418	00:26:00	00:26:04	Catherine Willows, cut your lunch short.
419	00:26:04	00:26:06	You got a 428.
420	00:26:06	00:26:09	Copy.
421	00:26:11	00:26:16	If you want me to call Judge Cohen at 4 you'd better bring me something more than a damn toenail.
422	00:26:16	00:26:17	Captain, you've got to make that call.
423	00:26:17	00:26:18	If you don't, he'll walk.
424	00:26:19	00:26:20	And what do you got? Hair fibers. Big deal.
425	00:26:21	00:26:23	So there was a struggle. I mean, who gives a corn cob?
426	00:26:23	00:26:25	The guy was protecting his wife and kid.
427	00:26:25	00:26:26	I've got the toenail.
428	00:26:26	00:26:32	If I can get a warrant and match the husband's shaving to his toe I can prove that the suspect's foot was inside the victim's shoe.
429	00:26:32	00:26:34	That alone will establish it was murder.
430	00:26:34	00:26:38	The guy lived there, Warrick. Maybe he put on the victim's sneaker and fetched the paper one morning.
431	00:26:38	00:26:42	I have a sworn statement stating he never wore the victim's shoe.
432	00:26:42	00:26:43	You don't even know the toenail was the vic's.
433	00:26:44	00:26:45	It can't be. He was wearing socks.
434	00:26:45	00:26:46	Not good enough.
435	00:26:46	00:26:46	Not good enough?
436	00:26:46	00:26:48	Look, I said no, Brown, damn it!
437	00:26:50	00:26:52	Hey, we're not done, Warrick.
438	00:26:52	00:26:53	You stay right there.
439	00:26:54	00:26:55	Criminalistics, Brass.
440	00:26:55	00:26:58	We've got a name on the suicide case, sir. He's local.
441	00:26:58	00:26:59	He's local, good.
442	00:26:59	00:27:01	I'll phone the judge for a warrant.
443	00:27:03	00:27:05	Hey, Warrick, I guess we're all done now.
444	00:27:05	00:27:07	Hey, do you mind closing the door behind you?
445	00:27:07	00:27:09	I got to make an important call.
446	00:27:09	00:27:12	We'll talk about your little foot fetish later.
447	00:27:12	00:27:14	Judge Cohen, please.
448	00:27:16	00:27:18	A white female, mid-20s.
449	00:27:18	00:27:20	Said she passed out behind the wheel.
450	00:27:20	00:27:21	Thought you might want to check it out.
451	00:27:22	00:27:24	All right. Thanks, brother.
452	00:27:26	00:27:27	Hi.
453	00:27:27	00:27:29	Nick Stokes, Criminalistics.
454	00:27:29	00:27:31	Mind if I take a look?
455	00:27:31	00:27:32	I don't know what happened.
456	00:27:32	00:27:34	I remember this song that was playing on the radio.
457	00:27:34	00:27:38	I just don't remember passing out.
458	00:27:38	00:27:40	Say ahhh...
459	00:27:40	00:27:43	What?
460	00:27:43	00:27:44	You know, ahhh...
461	00:27:44	00:27:45	Ahhh...
462	00:27:49	00:27:51	Ahhh...
463	00:27:54	00:27:56	No discoloration.
464	00:27:58	00:28:02	I don't see anything criminal here.
465	00:28:02	00:28:06	Take her to the hospital have her checked out.
466	00:28:10	00:28:14	Well, might as well roll the dice; take that ass-whooping.
467	00:28:24	00:28:26	Police!
468	00:28:26	00:28:29	Put your hands on top of your head and walk backwards towards me.
469	00:28:30	00:28:31	I'm ID. Check the badge.
470	00:28:31	00:28:32	I'm from Criminalistics.
471	00:28:32	00:28:36	Keep your mouth shut and follow my instructions. Now get down on your knees.
472	00:28:36	00:28:38	I won't get down on my knees for anybody. You can shoot me.
473	00:28:39	00:28:42	I said get down on your knees!
474	00:28:42	00:28:43	Hey!
475	00:28:43	00:28:45	What the hell are you doing?
476	00:28:45	00:28:47	That's Warrick Brown from ID.
477	00:28:47	00:28:48	Put those guns away.
478	00:28:48	00:28:52	Sorry, Judge, we got a call from a neighbor about a black man outside your house.
479	00:28:52	00:28:54	We responded.
480	00:28:54	00:28:55	All right, you caught him.
481	00:28:55	00:28:57	Congratulations.
482	00:28:57	00:29:01	Clear out of here before you wake the neighbors.
483	00:29:01	00:29:03	Yes, sir.
484	00:29:03	00:29:09	Dispatch, please be advised false alarm.
485	00:29:09	00:29:11	Brown, what the hell are you doing?
486	00:29:11	00:29:12	I'm sorry, Judge.
487	00:29:12	00:29:14	Captain Brass wouldn't call you for a search warrant.
488	00:29:14	00:29:16	I got a whopper on the line with a 100-pound test.
489	00:29:16	00:29:19	You got a winner for me?
490	00:29:19	00:29:22	I'll make it worth your while, you give me a name.
491	00:29:22	00:29:24	Favre.
492	00:29:24	00:29:27	Oh, I knew it. Listen, kid, I'll make a deal with you.
493	00:29:28	00:29:32	You put $5,000 down on the Pack for me I'll give you a blank warrant.
494	00:29:32	00:29:37	All I ask is that you have the ticket in my chambers before kickoff.
495	00:29:37	00:29:40	You do that, I'll square it with your Captain.
496	00:29:40	00:29:42	No problem, Judge.
497	00:29:43	00:29:46	A staged suicide.
498	00:29:46	00:29:48	You're kidding, right?
499	00:29:49	00:29:54	I swear on my kids I've never seen that man before in my life.
500	00:29:54	00:29:57	Then how the hell did your fingerprints wind up at the scene?
501	00:29:57	00:30:01	We talked to the family. The deceased didn't even know any Paul Millanders.
502	00:30:02	00:30:04	Oh, I...
503	00:30:04	00:30:05	Hi, Sergeant.
504	00:30:05	00:30:08	Would you mind if I, uh...?
505	00:30:08	00:30:11	Oh, you want a whack at him, Grissom be my guest.
506	00:30:12	00:30:16	Hi, Mr. Millander, my name's Gil Grissom.
507	00:30:16	00:30:17	I work in Criminalistics.
508	00:30:17	00:30:19	May I ask you a few questions?
509	00:30:19	00:30:20	Sure.
510	00:30:20	00:30:22	Do you have any hobbies?
511	00:30:22	00:30:27	Make model airplanes, make toys wind chimes for the backyard, that sort of thing?
512	00:30:27	00:30:30	No, why?
513	00:30:30	00:30:35	Well, we found some particles of latex on your thumbprint.
514	00:30:35	00:30:40	Would you have any reason to have access to that particular substance?
515	00:30:40	00:30:42	Well, yeah.
516	00:30:42	00:30:45	Yeah, sure. At-at my job.
517	00:30:57	00:31:00	Wow, you made all these?
518	00:31:00	00:31:03	Yes, sir, everything from scratch.
519	00:31:03	00:31:08	We mold, carve, shape, paint and authenticate.
520	00:31:08	00:31:10	Excellent work.
521	00:31:10	00:31:11	These seem very real.
522	00:31:12	00:31:13	Thanks.
523	00:31:13	00:31:16	You ever make any rubber hands?
524	00:31:16	00:31:19	Sure we do, uh...
525	00:31:24	00:31:27	This is our best seller right here.
526	00:31:27	00:31:33	Sold 10,000 of those units last Halloween. Even used my own hand for the mold.
527	00:31:33	00:31:35	These are your prints.
528	00:31:35	00:31:38	Yeah, why? What does that mean?
529	00:31:38	00:31:40	It means you're free to go.
530	00:31:40	00:31:41	He's not the guy.
531	00:31:41	00:31:43	Grissom, are you sure?
532	00:31:43	00:31:45	This explains the latex and the lecithin.
533	00:31:46	00:31:48	You need oil to make a print.
534	00:31:48	00:31:56	Anyone who purchased one of these hands could be the killer and what's worse, he's proficient in forensics.
535	00:31:59	00:32:01	Hey, Dr. Leever!
536	00:32:01	00:32:03	Hey, what's up, man? I got your page.
537	00:32:03	00:32:05	Have you had any trick rolls lately?
538	00:32:05	00:32:06	A ton of 'em. Why?
539	00:32:06	00:32:10	I've had six pros come through the ER in the past two nights all with two distinct similarities.
540	00:32:10	00:32:15	Every girl has been mysteriously knocked unconscious and we found some skin discoloration.
541	00:32:15	00:32:17	Skin discoloration?
542	00:32:17	00:32:18	Where? Their lips?
543	00:32:18	00:32:20	No, their nipples.
544	00:32:24	00:32:25	We meet again...
545	00:32:25	00:32:27	May I see your discoloration?
546	00:32:27	00:32:29	You wanna give me 20 bucks?
547	00:32:29	00:32:31	You wanna do time?
548	00:32:43	00:32:46	You know, I just came from a trick roll downtown.
549	00:32:46	00:32:48	The victim's mouth had similar blotching.
550	00:32:49	00:32:55	Chances are, whatever he ingested orally you absorbed through your nipples knocking you both out.
551	00:32:55	00:32:58	So I'll give you a choice.
552	00:32:58	00:33:07	You give back the old man his belongings you tell me what you girls are using and I won't have you charged with attempted murder.
553	00:33:07	00:33:09	Which is it?
554	00:33:18	00:33:19	Eyedrops?
555	00:33:19	00:33:22	No, it's scopolamine.
556	00:33:22	00:33:24	It's a chemical used for motion sickness.
557	00:33:24	00:33:25	This eyedrop bottle's a front.
558	00:33:25	00:33:28	One drop of this stuff and she's out cold.
559	00:34:01	00:34:03	We're ruling out suicide.
560	00:34:03	00:34:07	The evidence leads us to believe that it was in fact a homicide.
561	00:34:10	00:34:11	Then he was murdered?
562	00:34:11	00:34:13	I believe so.
563	00:34:18	00:34:20	You know...
564	00:34:20	00:34:28	this may sound funny but I feel better knowing that he didn't take his own life.
565	00:34:28	00:34:30	To me that would never sit right.
566	00:34:30	00:34:32	He was such a good man...
567	00:34:32	00:34:35	We'll find him, Ms. Harmon.
568	00:34:35	00:34:37	I promise you.
569	00:34:37	00:34:39	There is always a clue.
570	00:34:39	00:34:41	I'll find him.
571	00:34:46	00:34:48	Nurse, excuse me.
572	00:34:48	00:34:51	I'm Catherine Willows from Criminalistics and I'm here for the 428.
573	00:34:56	00:34:58	Hi, Laura.
574	00:34:58	00:35:00	I'm Catherine.
575	00:35:04	00:35:07	How you doin', kiddo?
576	00:35:07	00:35:09	What's that?
577	00:35:09	00:35:12	Well, that is a camera.
578	00:35:12	00:35:14	I'm gonna take a few photographs.
579	00:35:14	00:35:19	Before I do that, though, could you do me a favor?
580	00:35:21	00:35:27	Could you take a look at this drawing and point out to me...
581	00:35:27	00:35:29	where he touched you?
582	00:35:33	00:35:35	Can you just show me?
583	00:35:42	00:35:45	Can you hold my dolly for me?
584	00:35:45	00:35:48	I'd love to.
585	00:35:48	00:35:49	Not just hold her.
586	00:35:50	00:35:52	Take her away to your house.
587	00:35:52	00:35:55	To my house? Why?
588	00:35:55	00:36:00	Because I don't want the same thing that happened to me to happen to dolly.
589	00:36:09	00:36:10	It's okay.
590	00:36:13	00:36:15	It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
591	00:36:17	00:36:19	You're off the case.
592	00:36:19	00:36:20	What? Why?
593	00:36:20	00:36:22	Why? you deliberately went over my head, Brown.
594	00:36:22	00:36:25	The phone call from the judge saved your job, but not your ass!
595	00:36:25	00:36:26	I want you shadowing Gribbs.
596	00:36:27	00:36:28	A robbery just came in.
597	00:36:28	00:36:29	You can't do that. Me and Nick are tied!
598	00:36:29	00:36:31	Tough!
599	00:36:31	00:36:37	Grissom! Have Warrick shadow Gribbs for the next three weeks or until Nickie makes his hundredth, whatever comes first.
600	00:36:37	00:36:38	I hate your ass, you know that?
601	00:36:38	00:36:41	People walk every day because of you-- every day!
602	00:36:41	00:36:43	That's enough, Warrick. Let's go!
603	00:36:43	00:36:44	Damn it, Gris.
604	00:36:44	00:36:45	I had his ass too!
605	00:36:45	00:36:50	Yes, you had him and the minute you started thinking about yourself instead of the case, you lost him.
606	00:36:50	00:36:54	There is no room for subjectivity in this department, Warrick.
607	00:36:54	00:37:02	You know that we handle each case objectively without presupposition regardless of race, color, creed, or bubble gum flavor.
608	00:37:02	00:37:04	Okay?
609	00:37:17	00:37:19	Let's go.
610	00:37:27	00:37:29	Sorry you gotta baby-sit.
611	00:37:29	00:37:30	Yeah, I'm sorry too.
612	00:37:30	00:37:32	Control, P-4442 arrive.
613	00:37:32	00:37:33	Okay, go inside.
614	00:37:33	00:37:35	Dust for prints.
615	00:37:35	00:37:37	Make sure you take plenty of photographs...
616	00:37:37	00:37:38	Photographs. Be thorough. Don't worry.
617	00:37:38	00:37:39	I got the same speech from Mr. Grissom.
618	00:37:39	00:37:42	Good. Look, I gotta run an errand.
619	00:37:42	00:37:43	You'll be okay on your own?
620	00:37:43	00:37:45	You kidding? I'm fired up, ready to go.
621	00:37:45	00:37:46	Besides, there's an officer here.
622	00:37:59	00:38:01	Morning. Gil Grissom, Forensics.
623	00:38:01	00:38:03	I'm taking over the case for Warrick Brown.
624	00:38:04	00:38:05	Mind if I come in?
625	00:38:05	00:38:07	How can I help you?
626	00:38:07	00:38:09	I need to give you a pedicure.
627	00:38:09	00:38:10	Come again?
628	00:38:10	00:38:13	I have a warrant for your toenails.
629	00:38:14	00:38:15	A warrant?
630	00:38:15	00:38:18	What? Am I a suspect?
631	00:38:19	00:38:21	I already gave you a sworn statement.
632	00:38:21	00:38:24	A statement's just a public record of your version.
633	00:38:24	00:38:25	We still need proof.
634	00:38:30	00:38:34	Well, I'd love to help you, but I already cut them.
635	00:38:34	00:38:36	May I see where you discarded the clippings?
636	00:38:36	00:38:38	I flushed them down the toilet.
637	00:38:38	00:38:40	May I see your toilet?
638	00:39:06	00:39:09	I'll be right back.
639	00:39:16	00:39:18	Excuse me.
640	00:39:54	00:39:57	Control, this is P-3901.
641	00:39:57	00:40:00	I'm going to be on break for about 15 minutes.
642	00:40:00	00:40:02	Mommy?
643	00:40:02	00:40:05	Shh. We don't want to wake up Jeremy.
644	00:40:09	00:40:10	Mommy, what's wrong?
645	00:40:10	00:40:13	Mommy just kind had a rough night.
646	00:40:13	00:40:17	I couldn't drive here fast enough to tell you how much I love you.
647	00:40:17	00:40:20	I know, Mommy. I love you, too.
648	00:40:28	00:40:30	Nope, loser.
649	00:40:30	00:40:33	Give me the next item up for bid.
650	00:40:35	00:40:36	It's nasty.
651	00:40:37	00:40:38	No, striation.
652	00:40:38	00:40:44	Whenever two objects are broken there occurs what we call striae-- two unique connecting points.
653	00:40:44	00:40:48	If I can match the nail in the sneaker to the suspect's clippings...
654	00:40:51	00:40:52	Alcatraz!
655	00:40:53	00:40:54	The brother was right, wasn't he?!
656	00:40:54	00:40:55	Uh-huh!
657	00:40:55	00:40:58	Yeah!
658	00:40:58	00:41:00	Careful, Boe, you'll hurt your back.
659	00:41:05	00:41:07	What's up, man?
660	00:41:07	00:41:09	Gimme Packers. One second...
661	00:41:09	00:41:12	Warrick, come in.
662	00:41:12	00:41:14	This is Warrick. Go ahead.
663	00:41:14	00:41:16	It's Grissom. We got him.
664	00:41:16	00:41:18	Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, yeah!
665	00:41:18	00:41:20	I'll be right there.
666	00:41:20	00:41:21	Who do you want now?
667	00:41:22	00:41:24	Gimmie Niners for five dimes.
668	00:41:34	00:41:36	Open up!
669	00:41:36	00:41:38	Open the door...
670	00:41:38	00:41:40	What are you gonna do? Don't ask questions.
671	00:41:40	00:41:41	Just open the door.
672	00:41:41	00:41:44	You son of a bitch!
673	00:42:06	00:42:09	Call 911.
674	00:42:09	00:42:11	Do it!
675	00:42:27	00:42:30	Hey, weren't you supposed to be shadowing Holly?
676	00:42:30	00:42:32	Oh, she's cool.
677	00:42:32	00:42:34	She's doing prints on that 407.
678	00:42:34	00:42:36	There's an officer there.
679	00:42:36	00:42:38	I'm out.
680	00:42:54	00:42:55	Excuse me, ma'am.
681	00:42:58	00:43:00	Hi. Uh... can I help you?
682	00:43:00	00:43:05	I'm the neighbor from across the way and I just saw a cop car leave.
683	00:43:05	00:43:06	Is everything okay?
684	00:43:07	00:43:09	Yeah, we had a robbery, but everything's fine.
685	00:43:10	00:43:11	Oh, okay.
686	00:43:21	00:43:23	Room service.
687	00:43:23	00:43:25	You're kidding me.
688	00:43:30	00:43:33	My stuff!
689	00:43:33	00:43:34	You found my stuff!
690	00:43:34	00:43:38	Yeah, yeah, your wallet, your cash, credit cards...
691	00:43:38	00:43:39	wedding ring...
692	00:43:39	00:43:41	Oh, thank God.
693	00:43:41	00:43:45	Okay, next time you wanna take a shot go to the dice table.
694	00:43:46	00:43:50	At least if you crap out, you can go home broke instead of busted, you know what I mean?
695	00:43:50	00:43:52	I sure do.
696	00:43:53	00:43:54	Thank you.
697	00:43:54	00:43:56	Congratulations, Nickie my boy.
698	00:43:56	00:43:57	You are now a C.S.I. Level III.
699	00:43:57	00:43:58	Whoo!
700	00:44:00	00:44:01	Good job, Nick.
701	00:44:01	00:44:06	Thanks. Uh, hey, Warrick, listen I heard about the whole thing with the shoe and...
702	00:44:06	00:44:07	Forget it, man. It's all you.
703	00:44:07	00:44:09	Thanks.
704	00:44:09	00:44:11	Let's get some breakfast. It's on me!
705	00:44:11	00:44:15	Sorry to break up your party but I need grave to pull a double.
706	00:44:15	00:44:17	Holly Gribbs has been shot.
707	00:44:17	00:44:19	She's in surgery now.
708	00:44:19	00:44:23	Apparently the suspect returned to the scene.
709	00:44:25	00:44:27	They don't think she's gonna make it.
710	00:44:27	00:44:32	Brown, I'm putting you on administrative leave pending a full report of your whereabouts.
711	00:44:33	00:44:34	So wash your faces; change your socks.
712	00:44:34	00:44:35	You have a long day ahead of you.
