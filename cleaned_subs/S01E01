0,00:00:21,00:00:22,My name is Royce Harmon.
1,00:00:22,00:00:27,"I reside at 7642 Carpenter Street, Las Vegas, Nevada."
2,00:00:27,00:00:30,I am 41 years of age...
3,00:00:30,00:00:33,...and I'm going to kill myself.
4,00:00:35,00:00:40,"I'd like to say ""I love you"" to my mother Paige and my sister Gina."
5,00:00:40,00:00:42,I'm so sorry.
6,00:00:42,00:00:44,I never wanted to put you through this.
7,00:00:44,00:00:47,I just can't do it anymore.
8,00:00:47,00:00:48,"I love you, Mom..."
9,00:00:48,00:00:49,(gunshot)
10,00:00:49,00:00:52,(helicopter flying overhead)
11,00:00:52,00:00:53,(siren flipping on and off)
12,00:00:58,00:01:00,Here comes the nerd squad.
13,00:01:00,00:01:02,I hate the legwork.
14,00:01:02,00:01:06,"I'm telling you, that Deputy Chief job better come in soon."
15,00:01:06,00:01:10,I don't know how much longer I can put up with these damn public appearances.
16,00:01:12,00:01:13,Gentlemen...
17,00:01:13,00:01:14,"Hey, guys, take a break, huh?"
18,00:01:37,00:01:39,Suicide.
19,00:01:39,00:01:40,"You think so, huh?"
20,00:01:40,00:01:46,You got the sleeping bag for easy cleanup the bathtub to catch the bullet open window so the stench alerts the neighbors...
21,00:01:46,00:01:48,God bless him.
22,00:01:50,00:01:52,(coughs)
23,00:01:53,00:01:55,"Oh, geez..."
24,00:01:56,00:01:59,(clears throat)
25,00:02:06,00:02:08,"Pupa, stage three."
26,00:02:08,00:02:10,English. I'm not an entomologist.
27,00:02:11,00:02:14,It's the third stage of larva metamorphosis.
28,00:02:14,00:02:16,This guy's been dead seven days.
29,00:02:16,00:02:19,"That's a maggot, and he stinks."
30,00:02:19,00:02:20,"Oh, good, it's almost 11:00."
31,00:02:21,00:02:26,Maybe if I'm lucky I can break out of here in time for a shot at the first rack of the Krispy Kreme.
32,00:02:29,00:02:31,I think we may have our suicide note.
33,00:02:33,00:02:36,Harmon: I never wanted to put you through this.
34,00:02:36,00:02:37,I just can't do it anymore.
35,00:02:37,00:02:39,I've lost hope.
36,00:02:39,00:02:41,"I love you, Mom..."
37,00:02:41,00:02:42,(gunshot)
38,00:02:42,00:02:43,(both gasp)
39,00:02:43,00:02:44,"Oh, my God!"
40,00:02:44,00:02:46,"Go upstairs, Gina."
41,00:02:47,00:02:50,This can't be happening.
42,00:02:50,00:02:52,"We're so sorry about this, Ms. Harmon."
43,00:02:52,00:02:55,I can only imagine how difficult this must be for you.
44,00:02:55,00:02:59,"No, you don't understand."
45,00:02:59,00:03:01,This is his picture...
46,00:03:02,00:03:05,but that's not my son's voice.
47,00:04:04,00:04:05,Hello?
48,00:04:06,00:04:08,Ooh...
49,00:04:08,00:04:10,My God.
50,00:04:24,00:04:25,Hi.
51,00:04:25,00:04:27,(gasps)
52,00:04:27,00:04:28,Sorry.
53,00:04:28,00:04:29,Welcome to Forensics.
54,00:04:29,00:04:32,Gil Grissom. I'm your supervisor on graveyard.
55,00:04:32,00:04:33,Holly Gribbs.
56,00:04:34,00:04:35,Nice office.
57,00:04:35,00:04:40,Thanks. Would you mind taking off your jacket and rolling up your sleeve?
58,00:04:40,00:04:41,For what?
59,00:04:41,00:04:43,I need a pint of your blood.
60,00:04:43,00:04:45,It's customary for all new hires.
61,00:04:45,00:04:46,Why?
62,00:04:46,00:04:48,So many reasons.
63,00:04:49,00:04:52,I-I haven't even clocked in yet.
64,00:04:52,00:04:53,(people laughing in background)
65,00:04:53,00:04:59,"Attention, Command One more, baby, one more."
66,00:04:59,00:05:00,Hey.
67,00:05:00,00:05:02,There he is. What's up?
68,00:05:04,00:05:09,"99. You and me, dead heat."
69,00:05:09,00:05:12,"Next crime solved gets promoted to CSI III, man."
70,00:05:13,00:05:20,"Yeah, yeah, choice of shift, $8,000 raise extra week vacation-- oh-ho, it's all about Cabo, bro."
71,00:05:20,00:05:24,"Twenty bucks, by the end of shift, I'm the man."
72,00:05:24,00:05:26,Is there anything you won't bet on? Nah.
73,00:05:26,00:05:28,"It's college football season, man."
74,00:05:28,00:05:30,I won eight of ten this weekend.
75,00:05:30,00:05:35,Kilt 'em. Outside the Huskers and them punk-ass Irish I'm up about four G's.
76,00:05:35,00:05:37,"Hmm, what's the line on us?"
77,00:05:37,00:05:39,On us?
78,00:05:39,00:05:42,"I'm like Tiger, man-- I'm heavily favored."
79,00:05:42,00:05:45,"Come on, give me a winner for tomorrow."
80,00:05:45,00:05:49,"Ah... Green Bay, minus seven and a half over Niners."
81,00:05:49,00:05:52,Always go with the better quarterback.
82,00:05:52,00:05:53,Uh-huh.
83,00:05:53,00:05:57,"Cool. Hey, good luck tonight, man."
84,00:05:57,00:05:59,"Thanks. You, too, Nick."
85,00:06:00,00:06:01,"I hope you get that ""trick roll"" noise."
86,00:06:01,00:06:03,"You'll never crack that in a shift, never."
87,00:06:03,00:06:09,"Yeah, well, we'll see, and I hope the Pack wins by seven."
88,00:06:09,00:06:14,"We scrutinize the crime scene, collect the evidence recreate what happened without ever having been there."
89,00:06:14,00:06:16,"Pretty cool, actually."
90,00:06:16,00:06:19,I just got out of the Academy-- I already know this.
91,00:06:19,00:06:20,Of course you do.
92,00:06:20,00:06:28,"Then if you'll just sign these waivers for personal injury or death while in the line of duty, we can begin our shift."
93,00:06:29,00:06:31,Mmm...
94,00:06:31,00:06:32,What's the matter?
95,00:06:32,00:06:34,Um... I'm kind of light-headed.
96,00:06:34,00:06:35,"Sit down, sit down."
97,00:06:35,00:06:37,You're probably low on blood sugar.
98,00:06:37,00:06:39,I've got just the thing.
99,00:06:41,00:06:43,"Here, try one of these."
100,00:06:43,00:06:49,"No offense, but I don't think I want to eat anything that's been in this office."
101,00:06:59,00:07:01,Is there a grasshopper in here?
102,00:07:03,00:07:04,(crunching)
103,00:07:06,00:07:08,"When we get some free time, try and catch up on your reports."
104,00:07:08,00:07:10,I'm getting a lot of heat from the Sheriff's Office.
105,00:07:10,00:07:11,There I said it.
106,00:07:11,00:07:13,"Administration, not my favorite thing."
107,00:07:13,00:07:15,"All right, here we go."
108,00:07:15,00:07:17,"Nick Stokes, 414, trick roll."
109,00:07:17,00:07:19,Victim found drugged and robbed at the scene.
110,00:07:19,00:07:22,"Warrick Brown, 407, home invasion, forced entry."
111,00:07:22,00:07:26,Person reporting crime fired multiple rounds at the suspect.
112,00:07:26,00:07:28,Suspect's condition is unknown.
113,00:07:30,00:07:31,Anyone seen Catherine Willows?
114,00:07:35,00:07:37,"Okay, give me a kiss."
115,00:07:37,00:07:39,Mommy's got to go catch some bad guys.
116,00:07:39,00:07:41,I'll pick her up in the morning.
117,00:07:41,00:07:43,"Bye, sis. Bye."
118,00:07:43,00:07:44,I love you!
119,00:07:47,00:07:51,"Brass: So your mother is Lieutenant Jane Gribbs from Traffic, is that right?"
120,00:07:51,00:07:52,"Yes, sir."
121,00:07:52,00:07:54,"Well, congratulations, Gribbs."
122,00:07:54,00:07:55,You're the...
123,00:07:55,00:07:59,You're the fifth person I've been forced to hire.
124,00:07:59,00:08:00,We're the number two crime lab in the country.
125,00:08:00,00:08:03,We solve crimes most labs render unsolvable.
126,00:08:03,00:08:05,Now what makes you think you belong here?
127,00:08:06,00:08:15,"Sir, with all due respect I thought the key to being a lucid crime scene investigator was to reserve judgment until the evidence vindicates or eliminates assumption."
128,00:08:16,00:08:17,You're prejudging me.
129,00:08:17,00:08:20,I graduated with honors in criminal justice at UNLV.
130,00:08:21,00:08:21,"Yeah, so?"
131,00:08:22,00:08:22,That's not fair.
132,00:08:22,00:08:27,"Fair? Well, you think putting a juiced-in lieutenant's daughter on this shift is fair?"
133,00:08:27,00:08:28,"You know, I've been in the field 22 years."
134,00:08:28,00:08:29,I've seen it all.
135,00:08:29,00:08:32,"I've seen people like you come and go, and you know what?"
136,00:08:32,00:08:35,They're nothing but headaches and bad press.
137,00:08:37,00:08:39,Dismissed.
138,00:08:40,00:08:42,Fine.
139,00:08:46,00:08:48,Think you got through to her?
140,00:08:48,00:08:50,You're scheduled to appear at an autopsy at 12:30 a.m.
141,00:08:50,00:08:52,They're cutting up that bozo put a hole in his chest.
142,00:08:52,00:08:54,Take her with.
143,00:08:54,00:08:58,I think every new hire should experience an autopsy on their first night.
144,00:08:59,00:09:02,(siren wailing)
145,00:09:17,00:09:18,(child crying)
146,00:09:28,00:09:30,"Woman: It's okay, shh."
147,00:09:31,00:09:33,Willows: Ma'am...
148,00:09:33,00:09:34,are you all right?
149,00:09:34,00:09:35,She's fine.
150,00:09:35,00:09:37,She's just a little shook up is all.
151,00:09:37,00:09:39,Somebody want to tell us what happened here tonight?
152,00:09:39,00:09:45,My wife invited her drunk friend to stay here so he could get back on his feet.
153,00:09:45,00:09:47,"Two weeks tops, she says."
154,00:09:47,00:09:50,That was six months ago.
155,00:09:50,00:09:51,(child screaming)
156,00:09:52,00:09:53,"Jimmy, Jimmy!"
157,00:09:53,00:09:56,Please take your sweaty feet off the head pillow.
158,00:09:56,00:09:58,They stink.
159,00:09:58,00:09:59,(glass breaking)
160,00:10:05,00:10:08,Here's a 20-- twice as much as you came with. Hit the road.
161,00:10:08,00:10:10,(yelling)
162,00:10:10,00:10:11,Open up!
163,00:10:18,00:10:20,(wife screaming)
164,00:10:22,00:10:23,Call 911.
165,00:10:23,00:10:25,(child crying)
166,00:10:25,00:10:26,That was it.
167,00:10:26,00:10:29,I feared for my wife and my baby.
168,00:10:31,00:10:34,Let's put the baby to bed.
169,00:10:38,00:10:40,What do you think?
170,00:10:40,00:10:42,"Oh, he's lying. That's why I took this job."
171,00:10:42,00:10:45,I can always tell when whitey's talking out his ass.
172,00:10:45,00:10:46,It's a gift.
173,00:10:46,00:10:48,It's also your 100th.
174,00:10:48,00:10:51,"Yeah, that, too."
175,00:10:51,00:10:54,So tonight you might say I'm extra suspicious.
176,00:10:56,00:10:58,Why don't you print that tread and see how good you are?
177,00:11:13,00:11:15,Why are you doing that?
178,00:11:15,00:11:16,"It's just procedure, sir."
179,00:11:16,00:11:21,We just want to make sure the shoe on the suspect is the same shoe that kicked down your door.
180,00:11:21,00:11:23,Wait... Wait a minute.
181,00:11:23,00:11:24,What's the matter?
182,00:11:24,00:11:31,"Sir, after you shot the deceased, did you move re-dress, or alter the body in any way?"
183,00:11:31,00:11:33,"No, why?"
184,00:11:33,00:11:34,Talk to me.
185,00:11:34,00:11:36,The left shoe's tied differently.
186,00:11:36,00:11:41,"Sir, in the six months that the victim lived with you did you ever wear his shoes?"
187,00:11:41,00:11:43,"No, why would I do that?"
188,00:11:43,00:11:46,You willing to sign a statement to that effect?
189,00:11:46,00:11:47,Sure.
190,00:11:48,00:11:52,"Sir, what happened to your pinkie toe?"
191,00:11:53,00:11:55,I tripped over a rattle.
192,00:12:00,00:12:02,"You got to breathe through your ears, Gribbs."
193,00:12:02,00:12:04,"First dead body, ma'am?"
194,00:12:04,00:12:06,"Yes, sir, but I'll be okay."
195,00:12:06,00:12:08,"To tell you the truth, he looks fake."
196,00:12:08,00:12:14,"I hate to put a damper on your night, Grissom but it looks like we got ourselves a homicide after all."
197,00:12:14,00:12:17,"You see, if the victim had extended his arms like..."
198,00:12:18,00:12:19,"Here, I'll show you. Give me your hands."
199,00:12:19,00:12:22,"And pushed the trigger with his thumbs, like so..."
200,00:12:22,00:12:24,(echoing gunshot)
201,00:12:24,00:12:26,The wound would look like this.
202,00:12:26,00:12:27,"He's right, honey."
203,00:12:27,00:12:28,This wound's too big.
204,00:12:29,00:12:32,This person was shot from six to seven feet away.
205,00:12:32,00:12:35,"It's like somebody stood over him and, bam!"
206,00:12:35,00:12:37,(echoing gunshot)
207,00:12:37,00:12:38,Criminal homicide.
208,00:12:38,00:12:41,Let's see what God would have to say.
209,00:12:46,00:12:47,Are you okay?
210,00:12:47,00:12:48,"I'm sorry, sir."
211,00:12:48,00:12:50,I can't take the smell.
212,00:12:50,00:12:52,"Oh, God, restroom?"
213,00:12:52,00:12:54,Right down the hall to your right.
214,00:12:56,00:12:58,She is cute.
215,00:13:22,00:13:25,How soon does the Captain want that one out?
216,00:13:25,00:13:27,Eight hours.
217,00:13:27,00:13:29,Whoo!
218,00:13:33,00:13:35,(gasping)
219,00:13:35,00:13:37,Help! Help me!
220,00:13:37,00:13:39,(pounding on door)
221,00:13:41,00:13:43,There were bodies.
222,00:13:43,00:13:45,I could feel them breathing.
223,00:13:46,00:13:47,"Oh, God!"
224,00:13:47,00:13:49,"It's okay, Holly, it's all right."
225,00:13:52,00:13:54,You assholes!!
226,00:13:55,00:13:57,There.
227,00:13:57,00:13:58,Okay?
228,00:14:11,00:14:12,"What's up, fellas?"
229,00:14:12,00:14:14,We got a call about a trick roll.
230,00:14:14,00:14:15,Right there. Room 1413.
231,00:14:20,00:14:22,Hey.
232,00:14:24,00:14:26,Mr. Laferty?
233,00:14:26,00:14:29,"Well, what's left of him, anyway."
234,00:14:31,00:14:34,"I'm Nick Stokes, with Criminalistics."
235,00:14:34,00:14:36,You mind if I ask you a few questions?
236,00:14:36,00:14:39,"She got everything-- my wallet, my ID..."
237,00:14:39,00:14:41,"Hell, she even got my wedding ring."
238,00:14:41,00:14:43,Did you two have a nightcap?
239,00:14:43,00:14:45,You think she could've slipped you something?
240,00:14:45,00:14:47,"Nah, I can't drink. I got this bum ticker."
241,00:14:47,00:14:49,"Look, Officer, I..."
242,00:14:49,00:14:50,Nick.
243,00:14:50,00:14:53,You can call me Nick.
244,00:14:53,00:14:55,"Nick, I..."
245,00:14:55,00:14:57,I love my wife.
246,00:14:57,00:14:59,We've been married 31 years now.
247,00:14:59,00:15:01,I've never cheated on her before.
248,00:15:01,00:15:09,"I come into town for this convention and I'm setting in the lounge minding my own business, when this..."
249,00:15:09,00:15:12,sweet-smelling brunette came up to me and...
250,00:15:13,00:15:16,"Next thing I know, she's nibbling on my earlobe and..."
251,00:15:16,00:15:20,(laughing)
252,00:15:22,00:15:24,"Well, my goodness. Look at you."
253,00:15:32,00:15:36,"For a second there, I thought I was your age again."
254,00:15:36,00:15:39,We've been seeing more and more of these the past 48 hours.
255,00:15:39,00:15:41,Let's take a look.
256,00:15:41,00:15:43,Open your eyes wide for me.
257,00:15:43,00:15:45,Sunny side up.
258,00:15:48,00:15:51,"Now say ""ah."" Ah."
259,00:15:51,00:15:52,Was she hot?
260,00:15:52,00:15:54,(chuckling moan)
261,00:15:54,00:15:55,Attaboy.
262,00:15:55,00:16:01,"Mr. Laferty, your eyes look okay but I notice some discoloration around the inside of your lips."
263,00:16:01,00:16:03,Have you always had that?
264,00:16:03,00:16:05,No. What the hell is that?
265,00:16:05,00:16:10,I'll swab your gums see if we can find out what made you pass out.
266,00:16:15,00:16:18,"Grissom: You know, my first robbery solved was a store like this."
267,00:16:18,00:16:23,"When we caught the guy, the owner was so happy that he gave me a dozen farm fresh eggs out of his cooler."
268,00:16:23,00:16:25,"You're trying to cheer me up, aren't you?"
269,00:16:25,00:16:27,"Yes, I am. How am I doing?"
270,00:16:27,00:16:29,Pretty good.
271,00:16:29,00:16:30,Good.
272,00:16:30,00:16:33,"Okay, look, this was a routine robbery."
273,00:16:33,00:16:36,"Dust for prints, check the videotape take lots of fun photos."
274,00:16:36,00:16:39,I'll be back in about an hour to pick you up.
275,00:16:39,00:16:41,Okay.
276,00:16:41,00:16:45,If you get done early use channel seven on your walkie.
277,00:16:52,00:16:53,What's up?
278,00:16:53,00:16:55,"Hey, rookie."
279,00:16:55,00:16:57,Hair fibers from the home invasion.
280,00:16:57,00:16:58,Take a look.
281,00:16:58,00:17:00,Tell me what you see.
282,00:17:04,00:17:06,I see a lot of things.
283,00:17:06,00:17:08,Look at the end of the follicles.
284,00:17:09,00:17:14,"Oh, yeah, you know, I see, like little tiny seeds or sacs or something."
285,00:17:14,00:17:17,That's pulp when the human hair is yanked out like this.
286,00:17:17,00:17:19,"Ow! Damn, man."
287,00:17:19,00:17:21,"Look, you see the seeds?"
288,00:17:21,00:17:27,Hair only comes out in that form when it's yanked or pulled signifying a struggle.
289,00:17:27,00:17:29,You know what? I got to go.
290,00:17:29,00:17:33,"Tell Grissom, when he gets back I went to Homicide to do a follow-up on the husband."
291,00:17:33,00:17:34,Peace.
292,00:17:34,00:17:35,Yeah.
293,00:17:35,00:17:38,"Now, how long is this gonna take?"
294,00:17:38,00:17:42,I'm losing business because of you.
295,00:17:42,00:17:45,"Ma'am, I told you, if you let them in it will contaminate the scene."
296,00:17:45,00:17:46,"Oh, contaminate, my ass!"
297,00:17:46,00:17:48,What the hell difference does it make?
298,00:17:48,00:17:50,You ain't gonna catch 'em.
299,00:17:50,00:17:52,You never do.
300,00:17:52,00:17:54,"Sir, I'm on your side."
301,00:17:54,00:17:57,I just want to clear you.
302,00:17:57,00:17:59,Then clear me. I already told you everything.
303,00:17:59,00:18:00,I understand that.
304,00:18:00,00:18:02,The evidence tells us something different.
305,00:18:02,00:18:09,"So I'm going to ask you again, just one more time-- before you shot the deceased did a struggle ensue?"
306,00:18:09,00:18:11,(woman shrieks)
307,00:18:11,00:18:12,I've got a gun.
308,00:18:13,00:18:14,Woman: What are you doing?
309,00:18:17,00:18:17,(shrieking)
310,00:18:18,00:18:18,(gunshots)
311,00:18:18,00:18:20,Call 911.
312,00:18:20,00:18:23,(child crying)
313,00:18:29,00:18:33,I must've tied the laces wrong.
314,00:18:33,00:18:37,"I'm sorry, I..."
315,00:18:37,00:18:39,I know I should've told you earlier but...
316,00:18:39,00:18:41,I was nervous.
317,00:18:41,00:18:43,I mean...
318,00:18:43,00:18:47,I took a man's life here.
319,00:18:49,00:18:52,"You don't believe me, do you?"
320,00:18:53,00:18:58,"This is Holly Gribbs requesting backup at Junk's on West Owens, over."
321,00:18:58,00:19:00,This is Catherine Willows. Are you in danger?
322,00:19:00,00:19:03,"Uh, we're getting there."
323,00:19:03,00:19:07,This is my popsicle stand-- I'll defend it to the hilt if I have to!
324,00:19:07,00:19:09,"So, this is it, huh?"
325,00:19:09,00:19:11,"The $8,000 Q-Tip."
326,00:19:11,00:19:14,"Well, you're the chemist."
327,00:19:14,00:19:16,I just need to knowwhat knocked the old man out.
328,00:19:16,00:19:21,"In 20 seconds, this'll give us a complete chemical breakdown right down to the atom."
329,00:19:21,00:19:26,"But I'm going to warn you, though These mouth swabs don't always read."
330,00:19:27,00:19:29,"Vaginal swabs, no problem."
331,00:19:29,00:19:32,Anal swabs-- money.
332,00:19:32,00:19:33,Anal swabs?
333,00:19:33,00:19:34,Anal swabs.
334,00:19:34,00:19:38,Ouch.
335,00:19:38,00:19:40,(beeps)
336,00:19:40,00:19:45,(machine whirs quietly)
337,00:19:45,00:19:47,"Dude, you get NFL-2K for Dreamcast?"
338,00:19:47,00:19:49,Yeah. Bought it the day it came out.
339,00:19:49,00:19:52,"Those graphics are killer, aren't they?"
340,00:19:52,00:19:53,My team's the Falcons.
341,00:19:53,00:19:54,Who do you use?
342,00:19:54,00:19:56,Randy Moss.
343,00:19:58,00:20:00,(whirs and beeps)
344,00:20:00,00:20:02,(whirring slows)
345,00:20:02,00:20:04,"It didn't take, did it?"
346,00:20:04,00:20:06,A hint of saliva; some denture adhesive...
347,00:20:06,00:20:08,That's it.
348,00:20:08,00:20:11,"Sorry, man."
349,00:20:12,00:20:14,"All right, put the gun down."
350,00:20:14,00:20:15,What?
351,00:20:15,00:20:17,We're getting robbed again now?
352,00:20:17,00:20:18,Everything okay here?
353,00:20:19,00:20:20,"Yes, ma'am."
354,00:20:21,00:20:23,"Control, Junk's is a Code Four."
355,00:20:23,00:20:25,Officer: Copy that.
356,00:20:25,00:20:26,You the new girl?
357,00:20:26,00:20:28,"Yeah. Hi, I'm Holly Gribbs."
358,00:20:28,00:20:30,Thanks. I'm Catherine Willows.
359,00:20:30,00:20:31,And I'm Lesley Stahl.
360,00:20:31,00:20:33,"Look, let's forget the formalities."
361,00:20:33,00:20:35,Which one of you people's gonna clean my counter here?
362,00:20:35,00:20:40,"Let me tell you something, lady-- if you don't care about catching the suspect neither do we."
363,00:20:40,00:20:41,We're out of here.
364,00:20:41,00:20:43,You can pick your gun up tomorrow.
365,00:20:43,00:20:45,You can do that?
366,00:20:45,00:20:47,No.
367,00:20:49,00:20:51,Ow!
368,00:20:53,00:20:55,Damn!
369,00:20:55,00:20:56,Blunt force trauma case.
370,00:20:56,00:20:58,Bermuda Hills Country Club.
371,00:20:58,00:21:02,Pregnant wife caught her husband in bed with another girl.
372,00:21:02,00:21:05,What do you think? Malicious intent?
373,00:21:05,00:21:06,"Little bit, yeah. (camera clicks)"
374,00:21:06,00:21:08,How's it coming?
375,00:21:08,00:21:09,It's coming.
376,00:21:11,00:21:13,Whose blood is that?
377,00:21:13,00:21:14,The new girl's.
378,00:21:14,00:21:15,Would you like to donate?
379,00:21:15,00:21:17,"Hell, no."
380,00:21:17,00:21:19,How'd the follow-up go with the husband?
381,00:21:19,00:21:22,Boe tells me you were onto something.
382,00:21:22,00:21:23,The story's changed a bit.
383,00:21:23,00:21:25,Now he says therewasa struggle.
384,00:21:25,00:21:28,Said he stepped on his shoe while they were fighting.
385,00:21:28,00:21:29,You believe him?
386,00:21:29,00:21:33,"At first, no but now..."
387,00:21:33,00:21:35,"Hell, I don't know what to think."
388,00:21:35,00:21:37,You ever see the movie The Exorcist?
389,00:21:37,00:21:39,Yeah.
390,00:21:39,00:21:43,The old priest and Father Karras are about to exorcise the demon.
391,00:21:43,00:21:51,Father Karras explains that he's recorded the little girl's voice and he's broken down the spirit into three distinct personalities.
392,00:21:51,00:22:00,"But the old priest quickly corrects him-- ""There is only one."" Forget about the husband, Warrick."
393,00:22:00,00:22:02,Forget about the assumptions.
394,00:22:02,00:22:04,Forget about your promotion.
395,00:22:04,00:22:06,These things will only confuse you.
396,00:22:06,00:22:11,Concentrate on what cannot lie-- the evidence.
397,00:22:11,00:22:14,Follow...
398,00:22:14,00:22:16,the reason we're having this conversation.
399,00:22:18,00:22:21,Follow the shoe.
400,00:22:38,00:22:40,(sighs)
401,00:22:59,00:23:00,"Well, I'll be damned."
402,00:23:08,00:23:11,"Tripped over a rattle, my ass."
403,00:23:13,00:23:15,Remember this from your suicide case?
404,00:23:15,00:23:17,"Minute I pulled it, I knew something wasn't right."
405,00:23:18,00:23:21,The impression's perfect-- maybe too perfect.
406,00:23:23,00:23:25,Take a gander.
407,00:23:29,00:23:32,What are those red particles?
408,00:23:32,00:23:33,Latex flakes.
409,00:23:33,00:23:35,From what?
410,00:23:35,00:23:42,"Protective gloves, maybe but the way I figure it, this son of a bitch is smart-- probably planted the damn prints."
411,00:23:42,00:23:44,"So on a hunch, I chemically tested the flakes."
412,00:23:44,00:23:46,Guess what it was laced with?
413,00:23:46,00:23:47,Lecithin.
414,00:23:47,00:23:51,That chemical's found in cooking spray isn't it?
415,00:23:51,00:23:57,"If latex rubber and cooking spray went on a blind date, how would the night end?"
416,00:23:57,00:23:58,A lot better than ours did.
417,00:23:58,00:24:02,"I know, Pink Floyd's not your thing."
418,00:24:02,00:24:03,I have on cowboy boots.
419,00:24:03,00:24:05,I work in a lab.
420,00:24:05,00:24:11,What makes you think Dark Side of the Moon synched toThe Wizard of Oz is going to warm my damn barn?
421,00:24:11,00:24:13,I just thought it'd be something different.
422,00:24:13,00:24:14,You want to be different?
423,00:24:14,00:24:17,Pin me up against a wall; lay one on me like you mean it.
424,00:24:21,00:24:22,"You're slacking, pal."
425,00:24:29,00:24:30,How long till we get a hit?
426,00:24:30,00:24:35,"It could be four minutes, could be four days but you can bet your ass she'll give you something."
427,00:24:35,00:24:37,She always does.
428,00:24:38,00:24:40,Pin you against a wall?
429,00:24:44,00:24:48,"Look, um, I got to be honest."
430,00:24:49,00:24:51,This isn't me.
431,00:24:51,00:24:55,I was pushed into it by my mom.
432,00:24:55,00:24:57,She's a lieutenant in Traffic.
433,00:24:57,00:25:04,"She's never going to get out of Traffic. so, um-- I'm fulfilling her dreams, not mine."
434,00:25:04,00:25:12,"I can sit here and I can baby you and I can tell you to quit but I'm not going to do that, because I really love my job."
435,00:25:12,00:25:16,We're just a bunch of kids that are gettingpaid to work on puzzles.
436,00:25:17,00:25:19,Sometimes there's a piece that's missing.
437,00:25:19,00:25:22,Sometimes we solve it in one night.
438,00:25:23,00:25:25,So you think I should stick with it?
439,00:25:25,00:25:27,Stick with it?
440,00:25:27,00:25:29,The cops?
441,00:25:29,00:25:31,Forget it.
442,00:25:31,00:25:36,They wouldn't know fingerprints from paw prints and the detectives...
443,00:25:36,00:25:37,chase the lie.
444,00:25:38,00:25:44,"We solve. We restore peace of mind and when you're a victim, that's everything."
445,00:25:45,00:25:47,Stick with it.
446,00:25:47,00:25:52,At least until you solve your first and if after that you don't feel like King Kong on cocaine...
447,00:25:52,00:26:00,"then you can quit but if you stay with it my hand to God, you will never regret it."
448,00:26:00,00:26:04,"Dispatcher: Catherine Willows, cut your lunch short."
449,00:26:04,00:26:06,You got a 428.
450,00:26:06,00:26:09,Copy.
451,00:26:11,00:26:16,Brass: If you want me to call Judge Cohen at 4:00 in the morning you'd better bring me something more than a damn toenail.
452,00:26:16,00:26:17,"Captain, you've got to make that call."
453,00:26:17,00:26:18,"If you don't, he'll walk."
454,00:26:19,00:26:20,And what do you got? Hair fibers. Big deal.
455,00:26:21,00:26:23,"So there was a struggle. I mean, who gives a corn cob?"
456,00:26:23,00:26:25,The guy was protecting his wife and kid.
457,00:26:25,00:26:26,I've got the toenail.
458,00:26:26,00:26:32,If I can get a warrant and match the husband's shaving to his toe I can prove that the suspect's foot was inside the victim's shoe.
459,00:26:32,00:26:34,That alone will establish it was murder.
460,00:26:34,00:26:38,"The guy lived there, Warrick. Maybe he put on the victim's sneaker and fetched the paper one morning."
461,00:26:38,00:26:42,I have a sworn statement stating he never wore the victim's shoe.
462,00:26:42,00:26:43,You don't even know the toenail was the vic's.
463,00:26:44,00:26:45,It can't be. He was wearing socks.
464,00:26:45,00:26:46,Not good enough.
465,00:26:46,00:26:46,Not good enough?
466,00:26:46,00:26:48,"Look, I said no, Brown, damn it!"
467,00:26:49,00:26:50,(phone rings)
468,00:26:50,00:26:52,"Hey, we're not done, Warrick."
469,00:26:52,00:26:53,You stay right there.
470,00:26:54,00:26:55,"Criminalistics, Brass."
471,00:26:55,00:26:58,"Grissom: We've got a name on the suicide case, sir. He's local."
472,00:26:58,00:26:59,"He's local, good."
473,00:26:59,00:27:01,I'll phone the judge for a warrant.
474,00:27:03,00:27:05,"Hey, Warrick, I guess we're all done now."
475,00:27:05,00:27:07,"Hey, do you mind closing the door behind you?"
476,00:27:07,00:27:09,I got to make an important call.
477,00:27:09,00:27:12,We'll talk about your little foot fetish later.
478,00:27:12,00:27:14,"Judge Cohen, please."
479,00:27:16,00:27:18,"Officer: A white female, mid-20s."
480,00:27:18,00:27:20,Said she passed out behind the wheel.
481,00:27:20,00:27:21,Thought you might want to check it out.
482,00:27:22,00:27:24,"All right. Thanks, brother."
483,00:27:26,00:27:27,Hi.
484,00:27:27,00:27:29,"Nick Stokes, Criminalistics."
485,00:27:29,00:27:31,Mind if I take a look?
486,00:27:31,00:27:32,I don't know what happened.
487,00:27:32,00:27:34,I remember this song that was playing on the radio.
488,00:27:34,00:27:38,I just don't remember passing out.
489,00:27:38,00:27:43,"Say ""ahhh..."" What?"
490,00:27:43,00:27:44,"You know, ahhh..."
491,00:27:44,00:27:45,Ahhh...
492,00:27:49,00:27:51,Ahhh...
493,00:27:54,00:27:56,No discoloration.
494,00:27:58,00:28:02,I don't see anything criminal here.
495,00:28:02,00:28:06,Take her to the hospital have her checked out.
496,00:28:10,00:28:14,"Well, might as well roll the dice; take that ass-whooping."
497,00:28:22,00:28:23,(siren whooping)
498,00:28:24,00:28:26,Police!
499,00:28:26,00:28:29,Put your hands on top of your head and walk backwards towards me.
500,00:28:30,00:28:31,I'm ID. Check the badge.
501,00:28:31,00:28:32,I'm from Criminalistics.
502,00:28:32,00:28:36,Keep your mouth shut and follow my instructions. Now get down on your knees.
503,00:28:36,00:28:38,I won't get down on my knees for anybody. You can shoot me.
504,00:28:39,00:28:42,I said get down on your knees!
505,00:28:42,00:28:43,Hey!
506,00:28:43,00:28:45,What the hell are you doing?
507,00:28:45,00:28:47,That's Warrick Brown from ID.
508,00:28:47,00:28:48,Put those guns away.
509,00:28:48,00:28:52,"Sorry, Judge, we got a call from a neighbor about a black man outside your house."
510,00:28:52,00:28:54,We responded.
511,00:28:54,00:28:55,"All right, you caught him."
512,00:28:55,00:28:57,Congratulations.
513,00:28:57,00:29:01,Clear out of here before you wake the neighbors.
514,00:29:01,00:29:03,"Yes, sir."
515,00:29:03,00:29:09,"Dispatch, please be advised Judge Cohen's residence, a Code 4: false alarm."
516,00:29:09,00:29:11,"Brown, what the hell are you doing?"
517,00:29:11,00:29:12,"I'm sorry, Judge."
518,00:29:12,00:29:14,Captain Brass wouldn't call you for a search warrant.
519,00:29:14,00:29:16,I got a whopper on the line with a 100-pound test.
520,00:29:16,00:29:19,You got a winner for me?
521,00:29:19,00:29:22,"I'll make it worth your while, you give me a name."
522,00:29:22,00:29:24,Favre.
523,00:29:24,00:29:27,"Oh, I knew it. Listen, kid, I'll make a deal with you."
524,00:29:28,00:29:32,"You put $5,000 down on the Pack for me I'll give you a blank warrant."
525,00:29:32,00:29:37,All I ask is that you have the ticket in my chambers before kickoff.
526,00:29:37,00:29:40,"You do that, I'll square it with your Captain."
527,00:29:40,00:29:42,"No problem, Judge."
528,00:29:43,00:29:46,A staged suicide.
529,00:29:46,00:29:48,"You're kidding, right?"
530,00:29:49,00:29:54,I swear on my kids I've never seen that man before in my life.
531,00:29:54,00:29:57,Then how the hell did your fingerprints wind up at the scene?
532,00:29:57,00:30:01,We talked to the family. The deceased didn't even know any Paul Millanders.
533,00:30:02,00:30:04,"Oh, I..."
534,00:30:04,00:30:05,"Hi, Sergeant."
535,00:30:05,00:30:08,"Would you mind if I, uh...?"
536,00:30:08,00:30:11,"Oh, you want a whack at him, Grissom be my guest."
537,00:30:12,00:30:16,"Hi, Mr. Millander, my name's Gil Grissom."
538,00:30:16,00:30:17,I work in Criminalistics.
539,00:30:17,00:30:19,May I ask you a few questions?
540,00:30:19,00:30:20,Sure.
541,00:30:20,00:30:22,Do you have any hobbies?
542,00:30:22,00:30:27,"Make model airplanes, make toys wind chimes for the backyard, that sort of thing?"
543,00:30:27,00:30:30,"No, why?"
544,00:30:30,00:30:35,"Well, we found some particles of latex on your thumbprint."
545,00:30:35,00:30:40,Would you have any reason to have access to that particular substance?
546,00:30:40,00:30:42,"Well, yeah."
547,00:30:42,00:30:45,"Yeah, sure. At-at my job."
548,00:30:57,00:31:00,"Wow, you made all these?"
549,00:31:00,00:31:03,"Yes, sir, everything from scratch."
550,00:31:03,00:31:08,"We mold, carve, shape, paint and authenticate."
551,00:31:08,00:31:10,Excellent work.
552,00:31:10,00:31:11,These seem very real.
553,00:31:12,00:31:13,Thanks.
554,00:31:13,00:31:16,You ever make any rubber hands?
555,00:31:16,00:31:19,"Sure we do, uh..."
556,00:31:24,00:31:27,This is our best seller right here.
557,00:31:27,00:31:33,"Sold 10,000 of those units last Halloween. Even used my own hand for the mold."
558,00:31:33,00:31:35,These are your prints.
559,00:31:35,00:31:38,"Yeah, why? What does that mean?"
560,00:31:38,00:31:40,It means you're free to go.
561,00:31:40,00:31:41,He's not the guy.
562,00:31:41,00:31:43,"Grissom, are you sure?"
563,00:31:43,00:31:45,This explains the latex and the lecithin.
564,00:31:46,00:31:48,You need oil to make a print.
565,00:31:48,00:31:56,"Anyone who purchased one of these hands could be the killer and what's worse, he's proficient in forensics."
566,00:31:59,00:32:01,"Hey, Dr. Leever!"
567,00:32:01,00:32:03,"Hey, what's up, man? I got your page."
568,00:32:03,00:32:05,Have you had any trick rolls lately?
569,00:32:05,00:32:06,A ton of 'em. Why?
570,00:32:06,00:32:10,I've had six pros come through the ER in the past two nights all with two distinct similarities.
571,00:32:10,00:32:15,Every girl has been mysteriously knocked unconscious and we found some skin discoloration.
572,00:32:15,00:32:17,Skin discoloration?
573,00:32:17,00:32:18,Where? Their lips?
574,00:32:18,00:32:20,"No, their nipples."
575,00:32:24,00:32:25,We meet again...
576,00:32:25,00:32:27,May I see your discoloration?
577,00:32:27,00:32:29,You wanna give me 20 bucks?
578,00:32:29,00:32:31,You wanna do time?
579,00:32:43,00:32:46,"You know, I just came from a trick roll downtown."
580,00:32:46,00:32:48,The victim's mouth had similar blotching.
581,00:32:49,00:32:55,"Chances are, whatever he ingested orally you absorbed through your nipples knocking you both out."
582,00:32:55,00:32:58,So I'll give you a choice.
583,00:32:58,00:33:07,You give back the old man his belongings you tell me what you girls are using and I won't have you charged with attempted murder.
584,00:33:07,00:33:09,Which is it?
585,00:33:18,00:33:19,Eyedrops?
586,00:33:19,00:33:22,"No, it's scopolamine."
587,00:33:22,00:33:24,It's a chemical used for motion sickness.
588,00:33:24,00:33:25,This eyedrop bottle's a front.
589,00:33:25,00:33:28,One drop of this stuff and she's out cold.
590,00:34:01,00:34:03,We're ruling out suicide.
591,00:34:03,00:34:07,The evidence leads us to believe that it was in fact a homicide.
592,00:34:10,00:34:11,Then he was murdered?
593,00:34:11,00:34:13,I believe so.
594,00:34:18,00:34:20,You know...
595,00:34:20,00:34:28,this may sound funny but I feel better knowing that he didn't take his own life.
596,00:34:28,00:34:30,To me that would never sit right.
597,00:34:30,00:34:32,He was such a good man...
598,00:34:32,00:34:35,"We'll find him, Ms. Harmon."
599,00:34:35,00:34:37,I promise you.
600,00:34:37,00:34:39,There is always a clue.
601,00:34:39,00:34:41,I'll find him.
602,00:34:45,00:34:46,(phone ringing)
603,00:34:46,00:34:48,"Nurse, excuse me."
604,00:34:48,00:34:51,I'm Catherine Willows from Criminalistics and I'm here for the 428.
605,00:34:56,00:34:58,"Hi, Laura."
606,00:34:58,00:35:00,I'm Catherine.
607,00:35:04,00:35:07,"How you doin', kiddo?"
608,00:35:07,00:35:09,What's that?
609,00:35:09,00:35:12,"Well, that is a camera."
610,00:35:12,00:35:14,I'm gonna take a few photographs.
611,00:35:14,00:35:19,"Before I do that, though, could you do me a favor?"
612,00:35:21,00:35:27,Could you take a look at this drawing and point out to me...
613,00:35:27,00:35:29,where he touched you?
614,00:35:33,00:35:35,(whispers): Can you just show me?
615,00:35:42,00:35:45,Can you hold my dolly for me?
616,00:35:45,00:35:48,I'd love to.
617,00:35:48,00:35:49,Not just hold her.
618,00:35:50,00:35:52,Take her away to your house.
619,00:35:52,00:35:55,To my house? Why?
620,00:35:55,00:36:00,Because I don't want the same thing that happened to me to happen to dolly.
621,00:36:09,00:36:10,It's okay.
622,00:36:13,00:36:15,"It's gonna be okay, sweetheart."
623,00:36:17,00:36:19,You're off the case.
624,00:36:19,00:36:20,What? Why?
625,00:36:20,00:36:22,"Why? you deliberately went over my head, Brown."
626,00:36:22,00:36:25,"The phone call from the judge saved your job, but not your ass!"
627,00:36:25,00:36:26,I want you shadowing Gribbs.
628,00:36:27,00:36:28,A robbery just came in.
629,00:36:28,00:36:29,You can't do that. Me and Nick are tied!
630,00:36:29,00:36:31,Tough!
631,00:36:31,00:36:37,"Grissom! Have Warrick shadow Gribbs for the next three weeks or until Nickie makes his hundredth, whatever comes first."
632,00:36:37,00:36:38,"I hate your ass, you know that?"
633,00:36:38,00:36:41,People walk every day because of you-- every day!
634,00:36:41,00:36:43,"That's enough, Warrick. Let's go!"
635,00:36:43,00:36:44,"Damn it, Gris."
636,00:36:44,00:36:45,I had his ass too!
637,00:36:45,00:36:50,"Yes, you had him and the minute you started thinking about yourself instead of the case, you lost him."
638,00:36:50,00:36:54,"There is no room for subjectivity in this department, Warrick."
639,00:36:54,00:37:02,"You know that we handle each case objectively without presupposition regardless of race, color, creed, or bubble gum flavor."
640,00:37:02,00:37:04,Okay?
641,00:37:17,00:37:19,Let's go.
642,00:37:23,00:37:26,(Indistinct police radio transmission)
643,00:37:27,00:37:29,Sorry you gotta baby-sit.
644,00:37:29,00:37:30,"Yeah, I'm sorry too."
645,00:37:30,00:37:32,"Control, P-4442 arrive."
646,00:37:32,00:37:33,"Okay, go inside."
647,00:37:33,00:37:35,Dust for prints.
648,00:37:35,00:37:37,Make sure you take plenty of photographs...
649,00:37:37,00:37:38,Photographs. Be thorough. Don't worry.
650,00:37:38,00:37:39,I got the same speech from Mr. Grissom.
651,00:37:39,00:37:42,"Good. Look, I gotta run an errand."
652,00:37:42,00:37:43,You'll be okay on your own?
653,00:37:43,00:37:45,"You kidding? I'm fired up, ready to go."
654,00:37:45,00:37:46,"Besides, there's an officer here."
655,00:37:57,00:37:59,(knocking)
656,00:37:59,00:38:01,"Morning. Gil Grissom, Forensics."
657,00:38:01,00:38:03,I'm taking over the case for Warrick Brown.
658,00:38:04,00:38:05,Mind if I come in?
659,00:38:05,00:38:07,How can I help you?
660,00:38:07,00:38:09,I need to give you a pedicure.
661,00:38:09,00:38:10,Come again?
662,00:38:10,00:38:13,I have a warrant for your toenails.
663,00:38:14,00:38:15,A warrant?
664,00:38:15,00:38:18,What? Am I a suspect?
665,00:38:19,00:38:21,I already gave you a sworn statement.
666,00:38:21,00:38:24,A statement's just a public record of your version.
667,00:38:24,00:38:25,We still need proof.
668,00:38:30,00:38:34,"Well, I'd love to help you, but I already cut them."
669,00:38:34,00:38:36,May I see where you discarded the clippings?
670,00:38:36,00:38:38,I flushed them down the toilet.
671,00:38:38,00:38:40,May I see your toilet?
672,00:39:06,00:39:09,I'll be right back.
673,00:39:16,00:39:18,Excuse me.
674,00:39:54,00:39:57,"Control, this is P-3901."
675,00:39:57,00:40:00,I'm going to be on break for about 15 minutes.
676,00:40:00,00:40:02,Mommy?
677,00:40:02,00:40:05,Shh. We don't want to wake up Jeremy.
678,00:40:09,00:40:10,"Mommy, what's wrong?"
679,00:40:10,00:40:13,Mommy just kind had a rough night.
680,00:40:13,00:40:17,I couldn't drive here fast enough to tell you how much I love you.
681,00:40:17,00:40:20,"I know, Mommy. I love you, too."
682,00:40:28,00:40:30,"Nope, loser."
683,00:40:30,00:40:33,Give me the next item up for bid.
684,00:40:35,00:40:36,It's nasty.
685,00:40:37,00:40:38,"No, striation."
686,00:40:38,00:40:44,Whenever two objects are broken there occurs what we call striae-- two unique connecting points.
687,00:40:44,00:40:48,If I can match the nail in the sneaker to the suspect's clippings...
688,00:40:51,00:40:52,Alcatraz!
689,00:40:53,00:40:54,"The brother was right, wasn't he?!"
690,00:40:54,00:40:55,Uh-huh!
691,00:40:55,00:40:58,Yeah!
692,00:40:58,00:41:00,"Careful, Boe, you'll hurt your back."
693,00:41:05,00:41:07,"What's up, man?"
694,00:41:07,00:41:09,Gimme Packers. One second...
695,00:41:09,00:41:12,"Man (over radio): Warrick, come in."
696,00:41:12,00:41:14,This is Warrick. Go ahead.
697,00:41:14,00:41:16,It's Grissom. We got him.
698,00:41:16,00:41:18,"Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, yeah!"
699,00:41:18,00:41:20,I'll be right there.
700,00:41:20,00:41:21,Who do you want now?
701,00:41:22,00:41:24,Gimmie Niners for five dimes.
702,00:41:34,00:41:36,(man yelling outside): Open up!
703,00:41:36,00:41:38,Open the door...
704,00:41:38,00:41:40,What are you gonna do? Don't ask questions.
705,00:41:40,00:41:41,Just open the door.
706,00:41:41,00:41:44,You son of a bitch!
707,00:41:44,00:41:47,(three gunshots)
708,00:41:47,00:41:49,(baby crying in background)
709,00:42:06,00:42:09,Call 911.
710,00:42:09,00:42:11,(echoing): Do it!
711,00:42:27,00:42:30,"Hey, weren't you supposed to be shadowing Holly?"
712,00:42:30,00:42:32,"Oh, she's cool."
713,00:42:32,00:42:34,She's doing prints on that 407.
714,00:42:34,00:42:36,There's an officer there.
715,00:42:36,00:42:38,I'm out.
716,00:42:54,00:42:55,"Excuse me, ma'am."
717,00:42:58,00:43:00,Hi. Uh... can I help you?

730,00:43:41,00:43:45,"Okay, next time you wanna take a shot go to the dice table."
731,00:43:46,00:43:50,"At least if you crap out, you can go home broke instead of busted, you know what I mean?"
