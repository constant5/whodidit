3,00:00:42,00:00:44,Gil? I'm here already. Where are you?
4,00:00:44,00:00:45,I'm still in Peru.
5,00:00:45,00:00:47,"Are you at the party? Hold on, uh..."
6,00:00:47,00:00:49,"Hold on, Gil. I can't hear you."
7,00:00:49,00:00:52,Sounds like taiko drums in the background.
8,00:00:52,00:00:53,The deaf love the vibrations.
9,00:00:53,00:00:55,they can feel them on their skin.
10,00:00:55,00:00:57,Wh-why are you still in Peru?
11,00:00:57,00:00:58,Is everything okay?
12,00:00:58,00:01:00,Found another mass grave.
13,00:01:00,00:01:02,(static crackling): Government asked me to stay.
14,00:01:02,00:01:04,(static crackling): ...you there? Gil? Gil!
15,00:01:25,00:01:27,"(drumming ends) (applause, cheers)"
16,00:01:27,00:01:28,SIDLE: Mrs. Grissom!
17,00:01:28,00:01:30,Hi!
18,00:01:32,00:01:35,"Sara, I want you to meet someone. Julia Holden..."
19,00:01:35,00:01:39,head of the department of deaf cultural studies.
20,00:01:39,00:01:42,"Nice to meet you, Professor."
21,00:01:42,00:01:44,"Julia, please."
22,00:01:44,00:01:48,My students don't even call me Professor.
23,00:01:48,00:01:49,Sara's Gil's wife.
24,00:01:50,00:01:53,"Oh, the otherMrs. Grissom."
25,00:01:53,00:01:58,It's Sara Sidle. She didn't take his name.
26,00:01:58,00:02:01,Julia's been like a daughter to me.
27,00:02:01,00:02:03,I'm so proud of her.
28,00:02:03,00:02:09,"Published author, lecturer, foremost authority on deaf culture in the country. Hmm."
29,00:02:09,00:02:11,Ladies!
30,00:02:11,00:02:14,You look beautiful tonight!
31,00:02:14,00:02:16,"Have you met my daughter-in-law, Sara?"
32,00:02:16,00:02:19,Hi. I'm Dr. Eric Lambert.
33,00:02:19,00:02:22,I'm the director of the Gilbert Foundation.
34,00:02:22,00:02:24,"Oh, so you're the one who gets to choose the grant winner."
35,00:02:24,00:02:27,Half a million dollars!
36,00:02:27,00:02:29,And they're all a good candidate.
37,00:02:29,00:02:34,"Julia runs the selection committee, and she's very passionate about the candidates."
38,00:02:37,00:02:40,Sorry. I have a stack of papers on my desk.
39,00:02:40,00:02:41,I better get going.
40,00:02:46,00:02:47,Bye.
41,00:02:48,00:02:52,"So, where's your son?"
42,00:02:52,00:02:57,Gil got stuck in Peru. He's been doing some consulting work for the...
43,00:02:57,00:02:59,government. He's-he's not coming.
44,00:02:59,00:03:05,Seems like my son's away from home a lot.
45,00:03:07,00:03:09,(combo playing mellow jazz)
46,00:03:25,00:03:29,"(explosion thunders, car alarms wailing)"
47,00:03:34,00:03:35,SIDLE: Julia!
48,00:03:35,00:03:38,SIDLE: Hey! Get away from the car!
49,00:03:40,00:03:42,No! Get back!
50,00:03:43,00:03:45,It's gonna blow!
51,00:03:45,00:03:47,(Julia yelling)
52,00:03:47,00:03:49,"Julia, he-he's dead. Lambert is dead."
53,00:03:49,00:03:50,He's gone. He's dead. (sobbing)
54,00:03:52,00:03:53,He's gone.
55,00:03:57,00:03:59,You have to stay back!
56,00:04:40,00:04:43,Hey. STOKES: Wait a minute. You did something different.
57,00:04:43,00:04:45,"Oh, my goodness. I almost didn't recognize you."
58,00:04:45,00:04:47,"Yeah, yeah. Did you get a haircut or something?"
59,00:04:47,00:04:49,"Please tell me... Yes, we have your work clothes."
60,00:04:49,00:04:50,Here's your coveralls.
61,00:04:50,00:04:51,Thank you.
62,00:04:51,00:04:52,Here's a seat for you.
63,00:04:55,00:04:56,So who's the victim?
64,00:04:56,00:04:58,"Uh, Dr. Eric Lambert."
65,00:04:58,00:05:00,He's the director of the Gilbert Foundation.
66,00:05:00,00:05:01,I met him at the party.
67,00:05:01,00:05:03,STOKES: Black-tie event.
68,00:05:03,00:05:06,"Was it an open bar? You know, he did have a drink in his hand."
69,00:05:06,00:05:08,LANGSTON: Possible drunk driver.
70,00:05:08,00:05:09,Hit the streetlight; car exploded.
71,00:05:09,00:05:12,Were you the first one to respond?
72,00:05:12,00:05:14,Uh... no.
73,00:05:14,00:05:15,"Actually, she was."
74,00:05:15,00:05:17,"Uh, going to try and go talk to her."
75,00:05:17,00:05:19,My signing's pretty terrible.
76,00:05:20,00:05:22,"We'll, uh, we'll check out the vehicle."
77,00:05:26,00:05:31,Um... I need to ask you some questions.
78,00:05:31,00:05:32,Is that all right?
79,00:05:34,00:05:36,Did you see what happened?
80,00:05:41,00:05:42,Wait...
81,00:05:42,00:05:44,"Wait, wait, wait."
82,00:05:44,00:05:45,I-I-I don't understand.
83,00:05:45,00:05:47,It's too fast.
84,00:05:47,00:05:51,"Excuse me, excuse me-- you were at the party?"
85,00:05:51,00:05:52,"Uh, yes. Dennis Palmer."
86,00:05:52,00:05:53,Could you interpret for me?
87,00:05:53,00:05:54,"Sure, sure."
88,00:05:57,00:06:00,"SIDLE: Julia, what exactly did you see?"
89,00:06:00,00:06:06,"I was in my office, when I felt the explosion."
90,00:06:06,00:06:08,You felt it?
91,00:06:09,00:06:11,The vibrations.
92,00:06:11,00:06:14,My windows rattled. So I got up to see what was happening.
93,00:06:14,00:06:15,That'swhen I saw the fire.
94,00:06:15,00:06:21,I ran from my office as fast as I could.
95,00:06:21,00:06:23,That's when I saw it was Dr. Lambert.
96,00:06:23,00:06:26,I wish I could have saved him.
97,00:06:29,00:06:31,(siren whoops)
98,00:06:34,00:06:36,Reminds me of my first case.
99,00:06:36,00:06:38,Except you're not wearing a tie this time.
100,00:06:38,00:06:39,Gonna be hard to burrito him like that.
101,00:06:39,00:06:42,I could put him in the passenger seat of the van.
102,00:06:42,00:06:43,Then we could use the carpool lane.
103,00:06:43,00:06:46,"Always looking for the silver lining, eh, David?"
104,00:06:46,00:06:47,Yeah. That's me.
105,00:06:47,00:06:49,"Okay, guys. Come on."
106,00:06:51,00:06:55,Two things make a car go boom-- ruptured gas tank and a spark.
107,00:06:55,00:06:59,"LANGSTON: Rough terrain. Sliding down this hill, there's a lot of things that could have ruptured the tank."
108,00:06:59,00:07:03,"Yeah, and metal dragging over the rocks, could have caused a spark. If it was anywhere near the tank."
109,00:07:03,00:07:08,"Puncture, spark, boom."
110,00:07:08,00:07:14,"We're in a ravine at the edge of campus, yet all the witnesses say that they felt the explosion."
111,00:07:14,00:07:18,"But if the car blew up down here, the shock waves would've been..."
112,00:07:18,00:07:20,"absorbed by the hill, right?"
113,00:07:24,00:07:26,No skid marks.
114,00:07:26,00:07:29,Means the driver didn't pump the brakes or turn the wheel at all.
115,00:07:29,00:07:31,Looks like he went clean over.
116,00:07:31,00:07:32,Mm-hmm.
117,00:07:34,00:07:35,(inhales)
118,00:07:35,00:07:36,That's gasoline.
119,00:07:38,00:07:41,"You know, I don't think this explosion happened down in the ravine."
120,00:07:43,00:07:45,There's a debris trail here.
121,00:07:45,00:07:47,"Yeah, here we go."
122,00:07:50,00:07:51,Got something here.
123,00:07:58,00:08:00,"This looks like a detonator, Ray."
124,00:08:00,00:08:02,"I think I have another piece of it here, Nick."
125,00:08:04,00:08:08,Lambert... didn't just drive into this ravine.
126,00:08:08,00:08:09,He had a little help.
127,00:08:11,00:08:13,We got a point of explosion here.
128,00:08:21,00:08:22,Okay...
129,00:08:22,00:08:29,"so the explosion kills him or incapacitates him, the car continues on till it rolls over the edge."
130,00:08:29,00:08:31,This was no accident.
131,00:08:31,00:08:34,Someone planted a bomb in Lambert's car.
132,00:08:35,00:08:38,ROBBINS: Dr. Lambert showed no signs of smoke inhalation.
133,00:08:38,00:08:40,WILLOWS: So he was dead before the car caught fire.
134,00:08:40,00:08:42,The force of the blast ruptured his aorta.
135,00:08:42,00:08:44,Died almost instantaneously.
136,00:08:44,00:08:46,"Thank you, Doctor. Yeah."
137,00:08:46,00:08:47,Sara. Yeah.
138,00:08:47,00:08:49,"So, what did you find out about Dr. Lambert?"
139,00:08:49,00:08:50,"Well, he was never married."
140,00:08:50,00:08:52,No bitter ex-wife. No greedy kids.
141,00:08:52,00:08:54,I'm going to check with the school and see if he had any enemies.
142,00:08:54,00:08:56,What if you just check with your mother-in-law?
143,00:08:56,00:08:58,She's pretty dialed-in there.
144,00:08:58,00:09:00,"Uh, yeah, communication's not really our strong suit."
145,00:09:00,00:09:02,I thought you were learning to sign. I am.
146,00:09:02,00:09:03,I-I'm... I'm improving.
147,00:09:03,00:09:06,"It's not really a language barrier, it's just kind of a barrier."
148,00:09:06,00:09:08,She's very hard to get close to.
149,00:09:08,00:09:10,She questions everything.
150,00:09:10,00:09:12,She's got to be right about everything.
151,00:09:12,00:09:13,She's mostly unavailable.
152,00:09:13,00:09:15,(chuckling): Sorry.
153,00:09:15,00:09:16,"What? Oh, it's..."
154,00:09:16,00:09:18,you just described Grissom.
155,00:09:18,00:09:20,"Like mother, like son."
156,00:09:22,00:09:25,Greg... what have you got going on here?
157,00:09:25,00:09:28,I'm almost done rendering a 3-D simulation of your car bombing.
158,00:09:28,00:09:38,"Based on where the car was when it exploded, how much gas was in the tank, and using standard temperature and pressure, I was able to calculate the size of the explosion and the shock waves it produced."
159,00:09:38,00:09:45,"Now, the white dots represent our witnesses and their respective locations, at the time of the explosion."
160,00:09:45,00:09:46,Simulation's complete.
161,00:09:46,00:09:49,Let's blow somebody up.
162,00:09:49,00:09:59,"The shock waves hit the dorm and the surrounding buildings, like our witnesses said; except they never reached the Humanities building, though our witness there claims she had felt it."
163,00:09:59,00:10:01,It's impossible.
164,00:10:01,00:10:04,SANDERS: Yeah. The dormitories are blocking the Humanities building.
165,00:10:04,00:10:05,Who's the witness?
166,00:10:06,00:10:08,(beep)
167,00:10:08,00:10:09,WILLOWS: Julia Holden.
168,00:10:09,00:10:11,She lied to me.
169,00:10:11,00:10:12,WILLOWS: You think she was involved?
170,00:10:12,00:10:14,"SIDLE: If she was, we'll need evidence to prove it."
171,00:10:18,00:10:20,No sign of any nitrates or bomb-making materials yet.
172,00:10:20,00:10:23,"Well, maybe she made the bomb somewhere else."
173,00:10:25,00:10:27,Oop. Incoming.
174,00:10:27,00:10:28,"OFFICER: Sorry, ma'am. Can't go in there."
175,00:10:28,00:10:30,SIDLE: It's okay.
176,00:10:32,00:10:34,What are you doing here?
177,00:10:34,00:10:37,"Well, we're... conducting a murder investigation."
178,00:10:37,00:10:40,"What's going on, Nick?"
179,00:10:42,00:10:44,"Mrs. Grissom, we have reason to believe that..."
180,00:10:44,00:10:46,that somebody might have planted a bomb in Dr. Lambert's car.
181,00:10:46,00:10:48,A bomb?!
182,00:10:48,00:10:49,"Yes, ma'am."
183,00:10:49,00:10:53,You don't think Julia had anything to do with it?
184,00:10:53,00:10:54,SIDLE: Julia...
185,00:10:54,00:10:55,you...
186,00:10:55,00:10:57,were not being honest...
187,00:10:57,00:10:59,about where you were when the bomb went off.
188,00:10:59,00:11:02,Where were you really?
189,00:11:06,00:11:09,I haven't done anything wrong.
190,00:11:12,00:11:20,"Okay. We're executing a search warrant, and we're gonna need both of you to wait in the hall until we're done."
191,00:11:24,00:11:27,You don't seem to be winning any points with your mother-in-law.
192,00:11:27,00:11:29,"She really seems to like me, though."
193,00:11:31,00:11:33,STOKES: What's that?
194,00:11:33,00:11:36,It's a message...
195,00:11:36,00:11:39,a transcript from Julia's voice mail.
196,00:11:39,00:11:42,Dr. Lambert called her the night that he was killed.
197,00:11:42,00:11:43,What's the message?
198,00:11:43,00:11:45,"SIDLE: ""Julia, we need to talk."
199,00:11:45,00:11:47,"""This relationship has to end."
200,00:11:47,00:11:49,"""You know the risks involved, to us ""and to the school."
201,00:11:49,00:11:55,"We can't let it continue."" BRASS: So, let me guess, Lambert dumped you, and you blew him up."
202,00:11:56,00:11:59,I wasn't sleeping with Dr. Lambert.
203,00:11:59,00:12:01,And I certainly didn't kill him.
204,00:12:01,00:12:04,So he wasn't the man that you were having sex with at the party?
205,00:12:05,00:12:10,BRASS: You lied to us about being in your office at the time of the explosion.
206,00:12:10,00:12:15,"I think you planted the bomb in his car, and then you followed him to make sure it detonated."
207,00:12:15,00:12:19,And then you pretended like you just got there and you were trying to save him.
208,00:12:20,00:12:22,"I told you, I didn't kill him."
209,00:12:29,00:12:31,Obviously...
210,00:12:31,00:12:33,there's a conflict of interest here.
211,00:12:33,00:12:36,What's she talking about?
212,00:12:38,00:12:41,My history with your husband.
213,00:12:41,00:12:44,What history?
214,00:12:45,00:12:47,We were involved.
215,00:12:47,00:12:49,Intimately.
216,00:12:53,00:12:56,"Well, this is awkward."
217,00:12:59,00:13:01,He didn't tell you?
218,00:13:01,00:13:05,I assumed married people told each other everything.
219,00:13:05,00:13:08,My marriage has nothing to do with this case.
220,00:13:13,00:13:15,It does now.
221,00:13:17,00:13:19,(clears throat)
222,00:13:26,00:13:32,"So, Julia Holden agreed to give us a DNA sample but wouldn't say anything else without her lawyer."
223,00:13:32,00:13:34,"Yeah, of course she wouldn't."
224,00:13:34,00:13:36,She totally played me.
225,00:13:36,00:13:40,"She knew exactly who I was, and she knew that I didn't know anything about her and Gil."
226,00:13:40,00:13:44,"Come on, I mean, for all you know, they only went out a couple of times."
227,00:13:44,00:13:46,"Well, they slept together."
228,00:13:46,00:13:47,She made that perfectly clear.
229,00:13:47,00:13:52,She also made it perfectly clear that she would not continue with the interview until I was out of the room.
230,00:13:54,00:13:55,What did Brass say?
231,00:13:55,00:13:58,What do you think? He wants you off the case.
232,00:13:58,00:14:00,I said no.
233,00:14:00,00:14:07,"I told him that you're a professional, and completely capable of being objective. Thanks."
234,00:14:07,00:14:10,"Youare capable of being professional and objective, right?"
235,00:14:10,00:14:11,"Yes, I am."
236,00:14:11,00:14:12,Great.
237,00:14:12,00:14:17,We didn't find any evidence of bomb-making materials at Julia's office or her house.
238,00:14:17,00:14:18,Maybe the guys'll find something.
239,00:14:18,00:14:21,They're checking Lambert's car now.
240,00:14:24,00:14:26,(groans quietly)
241,00:14:26,00:14:28,"Well, this used to be a gas tank."
242,00:14:28,00:14:31,Yeah. Not much left of it.
243,00:14:33,00:14:36,(clanking)
244,00:14:36,00:14:37,"What is that, a magnet?"
245,00:14:37,00:14:39,Industrial-strength magnet.
246,00:14:39,00:14:43,Must have used it to secure the bomb to the gas tank.
247,00:14:44,00:14:45,(grunts)
248,00:14:45,00:14:48,"I think you're losing your superpowers there, Dr. Ray."
249,00:14:48,00:14:49,(chuckles)
250,00:14:49,00:14:52,"Come on, let's go check it out."
251,00:14:52,00:14:54,Yeah...
252,00:14:54,00:14:58,this thing is... pretty badly scorched.
253,00:14:58,00:15:02,STOKES: These are all the bomb fragments we got on the road.
254,00:15:02,00:15:04,"We've got a detonator, but..."
255,00:15:04,00:15:07,we still haven't found a timer of any kind.
256,00:15:07,00:15:12,Lambert's car was left unattended during the party-- that's a perfect opportunity for someone to come along and...
257,00:15:12,00:15:20,"plant the bomb. Killer waits for Lambert to leave the party, follow him-- when the car gets close enough to the ravine, flip a switch and boom, car blows up and goes off the road."
258,00:15:20,00:15:22,That means that the killer was on campus.
259,00:15:22,00:15:25,"Let's get the fragments over to Trace, see if we can get anything off of 'em."
260,00:15:41,00:15:45,I found nitrates on the bomb fragments consistent with smokeless gunpowder.
261,00:15:45,00:15:50,The last time we saw smokeless gunpowder was in the bombs planted at the police funeral.
262,00:15:50,00:15:52,Except those devices were more sophisticated.
263,00:15:52,00:15:59,"Yeah, well, based on the scorch marks, I'm guessing that this was used to hold the explosives."
264,00:15:59,00:16:05,"The curved shape would have given the blast the directional component, driving it upward into the gas tank."
265,00:16:05,00:16:10,I've recovered a partial serial number and manufacturer's mark-- I'm just running it now.
266,00:16:10,00:16:12,Hm. Looks like you got a hit.
267,00:16:13,00:16:17,Company that makes consumer products for the deaf.
268,00:16:17,00:16:20,Looks like our bell-shaped charge started its life as part of something called the...
269,00:16:20,00:16:21,Shake Alert.
270,00:16:21,00:16:23,I got one of those.
271,00:16:23,00:16:25,What do you need with a deaf fire alarm?
272,00:16:25,00:16:27,My mother snores like a bear.
273,00:16:27,00:16:29,So I sleep with ear plugs.
274,00:16:29,00:16:38,"If there's a fire, then the Shake Alert receives a signal from any standard smoke detector and... shakes my bed, wakes me up and saves my life."
275,00:16:38,00:16:39,Okay.
276,00:16:41,00:16:48,This Shake Alert came from a batch installed in the dorms at Gilbert College.
277,00:16:48,00:16:51,(music blaring)
278,00:17:05,00:17:07,(turns music off)
279,00:17:18,00:17:21,(turns on music)
280,00:17:23,00:17:25,(music playing in distance)
281,00:17:27,00:17:30,Sorry.
282,00:17:34,00:17:37,"Hey, Sara?"
283,00:17:37,00:17:39,Yeah.
284,00:17:39,00:17:41,This fire alarm is different than the other ones.
285,00:17:41,00:17:43,It's white-- all the other ones were black.
286,00:17:43,00:17:45,Could be brand-new.
287,00:17:45,00:17:47,Whose room is this?
288,00:17:47,00:17:48,Michael Porter.
289,00:17:48,00:17:51,He's Julia Holden's T.A.
290,00:17:51,00:17:53,"STOKES: What happened to your old fire alarm, Michael?"
291,00:17:53,00:17:54,I don't know.
292,00:17:54,00:17:56,I didn't even know it was replaced.
293,00:17:56,00:17:59,You weren't at the party last night-- were you in your room the whole time?
294,00:18:00,00:18:02,Yes.
295,00:18:02,00:18:03,"Really, I should've been at the party."
296,00:18:05,00:18:09,"Apparently, Julia and Dr. Lambert didn't consider my research project worthy of the Gilbert Grant."
297,00:18:09,00:18:12,"Well, a half million dollars is a lot of money to miss out on."
298,00:18:12,00:18:17,"I've been Julia's T.A. for two years, doing research, I even picked up her dry cleaning."
299,00:18:17,00:18:22,Then suddenly this Sean Wyatt guy shows up from England-- it's like he's the chosen one.
300,00:18:22,00:18:24,And a finalist for the grant.
301,00:18:25,00:18:27,He's Julia's pet.
302,00:18:27,00:18:30,Was Sean Dr. Lambert's pet as well?
303,00:18:31,00:18:32,Hardly.
304,00:18:32,00:18:35,"A few days ago, I saw them arguing."
305,00:18:35,00:18:36,It got pretty heated.
306,00:18:39,00:18:40,(angry grunt)
307,00:18:40,00:18:43,What was that argument about?
308,00:18:44,00:18:47,I'm not sure.
309,00:18:47,00:18:55,"But Dr. Lambert said something like, ""If you don't fix this, I will."" SIDLE: Sean Wyatt is a big fan of Julia's work."
310,00:18:55,00:18:57,He's got a lot of her books.
311,00:18:57,00:19:01,"This kid's in the deaf studies program and she's his advisor, so..."
312,00:19:01,00:19:02,(quiet beeping)
313,00:19:04,00:19:06,Sara? Hm?
314,00:19:06,00:19:08,Positive for nitrates.
315,00:19:10,00:19:13,"Okay, well, we know that Sean and Dr. Lambert had a fight."
316,00:19:13,00:19:16,Maybe Lambert decided not to give him the half-million dollars.
317,00:19:16,00:19:19,And Sean decides to get rid of him? Yeah.
318,00:19:19,00:19:24,"With Lambert out of the way, Julia gets to choose the grant winner, and Sean gets the half a million."
319,00:19:24,00:19:26,Sean is Julia's student.
320,00:19:26,00:19:28,She was the first one at the scene andshe lied.
321,00:19:28,00:19:30,"You still like Julia Holden for this, don't you?"
322,00:19:30,00:19:33,I do. Why? None of the physical evidence points to her.
323,00:19:33,00:19:34,I am not making this personal.
324,00:19:34,00:19:37,"Okay. All right, maybe a little."
325,00:19:37,00:19:40,"You know, it would've been nice if Gil had told me about him and Julia."
326,00:19:40,00:19:43,It's ancient history-- I'm sure it happened before the two of you even got together.
327,00:19:43,00:19:46,She ispretty.
328,00:19:46,00:19:48,Yeah.
329,00:19:48,00:19:50,"Yeah, she's pretty."
330,00:19:50,00:19:52,"She's very pretty, actually."
331,00:19:54,00:19:55,"Hi, Mrs. G."
332,00:19:55,00:19:56,"Oh, great. Hi, Betty."
333,00:19:58,00:20:00,"Um, I'll catch up."
334,00:20:00,00:20:03,Okay. See you back at the lab.
335,00:20:06,00:20:08,I heard you called Julia in for more questioning.
336,00:20:08,00:20:11,"Well, yes-- she's a suspect in Dr. Lambert's murder."
337,00:20:14,00:20:16,Julia would never hurt anyone.
338,00:20:16,00:20:17,I know her.
339,00:20:17,00:20:19,"Obviously, she was intimately involved with your son."
340,00:20:19,00:20:21,"Thanks for the heads-up, by the way."
341,00:20:22,00:20:23,I thought you knew.
342,00:20:23,00:20:26,No.
343,00:20:28,00:20:33,"Maybe if you and Gil saw each other more often, you'd know more about each other."
344,00:20:42,00:20:44,Betty...
345,00:20:44,00:20:47,"a man was murdered, someone you know."
346,00:20:47,00:20:53,"If there was something going on between Julia and Dr. Lambert, you have to tell me."
347,00:20:57,00:21:03,Dr. Lambert was a stickler for rules and deadlines.
348,00:21:03,00:21:06,"Lately, Julia's been distracted."
349,00:21:06,00:21:08,"Late with paperwork, missing classes."
350,00:21:08,00:21:11,Any idea why?
351,00:21:11,00:21:13,I asked her about it.
352,00:21:13,00:21:15,She said everything was fine.
353,00:21:17,00:21:19,Thank you.
354,00:21:21,00:21:26,"Hey, I tested the nitrates in Sean Wyatt's room."
355,00:21:26,00:21:28,Did he have a plant?
356,00:21:28,00:21:30,A dead fern and a cactus. Ah.
357,00:21:30,00:21:32,The classic male green thumb.
358,00:21:32,00:21:38,Explains why the nitrates are less consistent with explosives and more consistent with fertilizer.
359,00:21:38,00:21:42,"I did, however, find something on the sheets you collected from his dorm room."
360,00:21:42,00:21:44,Hair and vaginal contributions.
361,00:21:44,00:21:46,Both from Julia Holden.
362,00:21:46,00:21:48,Having sex with one of her students.
363,00:21:48,00:21:52,Maybe Sean was the one that Julia was having sex with in the bathroom.
364,00:21:52,00:21:53,Ooh.
365,00:21:53,00:21:55,Quite the libertine.
366,00:21:55,00:21:58,Not unlike Lady Heather.
367,00:21:58,00:22:07,"Clearly, Grissom has a yen for sexually adventurous women whose voracious appetites can only be sated by dangerous and unbridled passion."
368,00:22:07,00:22:08,Thank you. (clears throat)
369,00:22:08,00:22:11,"Um, at-at least most of the time."
370,00:22:11,00:22:21,"That is, until he realized, of course, that even though you can have sexual satisfaction, it doesn't hold a candle to spirited intellectual stimulation."
371,00:22:21,00:22:22,Not...
372,00:22:22,00:22:26,to say that you and Grissom don't...
373,00:22:26,00:22:28,"have a great sex life, um..."
374,00:22:28,00:22:31,"I mean, when you happen to be in the same city... (chuckles)"
375,00:22:31,00:22:33,Isn't that your phone down the hall?
376,00:22:33,00:22:35,"Yes, it is. Thank you."
377,00:22:40,00:22:44,Grissom and I have great sex.
378,00:22:44,00:22:46,I'm sure you do.
379,00:22:46,00:22:48,"Okay, so, um..."
380,00:22:48,00:22:49,Lambert... (clears throat)
381,00:22:49,00:22:56,left a message on Julia's phone about a relationship that had to end-- maybe he was talking about Sean.
382,00:22:56,00:23:00,"Sex with a student is a huge scandal for the school, and..."
383,00:23:00,00:23:03,it's kind of a career ender for Julia Holden.
384,00:23:03,00:23:08,"Maybe Sean didn't just kill Lambert for the money, maybe he killed him for love."
385,00:23:10,00:23:12,Okay.
386,00:23:12,00:23:21,"Mr. Wyatt, we found evidence in your room that you and Julia Holden had a sexual relationship, and my guess is that Lambert found out about it, and that's what your argument was about."
387,00:23:21,00:23:22,Am I going too fast for you?
388,00:23:22,00:23:23,Okay.
389,00:23:23,00:23:24,(sighs)
390,00:23:24,00:23:25,Yes.
391,00:23:25,00:23:33,He demanded that I withdraw my application to the Gilbert Grant. He told me that my affair with Julia could be seen as favoritism.
392,00:23:33,00:23:34,"Oh, you think?"
393,00:23:34,00:23:36,And then you put a bomb in his car.
394,00:23:36,00:23:43,"You killed Lambert, Julia gets to keep her job, you get to keep your grant-- everybody wins."
395,00:23:43,00:23:46,"No, I loved Julia."
396,00:23:46,00:23:49,"And yes, I wanted the grant, but I didn't kill anyone."
397,00:23:49,00:23:52,"You were at the party, you had motive and opportunity."
398,00:23:52,00:23:56,"When Lambert left, you followed him."
399,00:23:56,00:23:58,I left the party beforehe did.
400,00:23:58,00:23:59,Where'd you go?
401,00:24:00,00:24:02,I went back to my dorm room.
402,00:24:02,00:24:04,Can anyone confirm that?
403,00:24:05,00:24:07,Julia.
404,00:24:07,00:24:11,"She arrived at quarter to 10:00, and left before 11:00."
405,00:24:12,00:24:14,Just before the explosion.
406,00:24:40,00:24:42,What do you want now?
407,00:24:42,00:24:44,We have more questions for you.
408,00:24:45,00:24:46,You need to come with us.
409,00:24:47,00:24:50,Fine. Let me call my lawyer.
410,00:24:50,00:24:52,Fine.
411,00:24:56,00:24:58,(alarm blaring)
412,00:25:04,00:25:08,"Are you guys all right? Yeah, we're fine. We're fine."
413,00:25:08,00:25:12,"You okay? SIDE: Yeah. LANGSTON: The paramedics took Julia Holden to the hospital, possible concussion."
414,00:25:12,00:25:17,"Right before the explosion, we saw Michael, Julia's T.A., place a package on her desk."
415,00:25:17,00:25:21,"You think it was the bomb? Well, we already know that Michael had a beef with Julia and Dr. Lambert."
416,00:25:21,00:25:28,"LANGSTON: The bomb in Dr. Lambert's car didn't give us much, but, here, we're in a contained space and there was no fire-- we should be able to collect a lot more evidence."
417,00:25:28,00:25:31,"Yeah... yeah, maybe enough to pin this on Michael."
418,00:25:42,00:25:47,SIDLE: Piece of a box. Looks like the bomb was hidden in a package.
419,00:25:47,00:25:48,"STOKES: You know, most..."
420,00:25:48,00:25:55,"package bombs are rigged to explode when you open them, but I think this one was a little bit different."
421,00:25:55,00:25:58,"Got a resistor-- it creates a delay, like a timer."
422,00:25:58,00:26:02,"If you're gonna hand-deliver a bomb, you want to make sure you have time to get away."
423,00:26:03,00:26:05,I would never kill anyone.
424,00:26:05,00:26:06,Really?
425,00:26:06,00:26:08,Your computer says different.
426,00:26:08,00:26:09,Nice stalker wall.
427,00:26:12,00:26:17,You had a grudge against Julia because she recommended Sean Wyatt for the grant instead of you.
428,00:26:22,00:26:24,I was angry.
429,00:26:24,00:26:25,I needed to vent.
430,00:26:25,00:26:29,I should have had a chance at that grant-- they took it from me.
431,00:26:32,00:26:38,I did not put the bomb in Dr. Lambert's car or Julia's office.
432,00:26:39,00:26:41,"Michael, you have the skills."
433,00:26:41,00:26:43,Your major is electrical engineering.
434,00:26:43,00:26:46,You're doing R&amp;D on deaf assist devices.
435,00:26:46,00:26:53,We recovered a resistor from the bomb in Julia's office that traces to a batch that you ordered for your research.
436,00:26:54,00:26:55,You've got the wrong person.
437,00:26:55,00:26:59,The parts you're talking about were stolen from me.
438,00:27:00,00:27:02,I reported it to the campus police.
439,00:27:02,00:27:04,Go ahead and ask them.
440,00:27:04,00:27:06,"Oh, we will."
441,00:27:08,00:27:11,Somebody's setting me up.
442,00:27:11,00:27:13,Who would do that?
443,00:27:14,00:27:17,Have you checked into Sean Wyatt?
444,00:27:17,00:27:18,"I mean, really looked into him?"
445,00:27:18,00:27:20,There's something strange.
446,00:27:20,00:27:25,"I don't know exactly what it is, but... something's just not right with him."
447,00:27:50,00:27:52,"WOMAN (over P.A.): Dr. Alist, call the page operator."
448,00:27:52,00:27:55,"Dr. Alist, call the page operator."
449,00:27:57,00:27:58,Mind if I join you?
450,00:28:02,00:28:08,I hope you're not here to accuse Julia of blowing up her own office.
451,00:28:08,00:28:12,"Actually, we have a new suspect-- Michael."
452,00:28:12,00:28:13,He's Julia's T.A.
453,00:28:14,00:28:24,"I find it so hard to believe that there's someone in this school, in our community, capable of such violence."
454,00:28:24,00:28:31,"When I went to take Julia's statement just now, I saw her talking to Sean Wyatt, and he signed something that I didn't recognize, nor did he."
455,00:28:31,00:28:34,Do you know what this means?
456,00:28:43,00:28:46,"That means ""sweet pea"" in LSQ."
457,00:28:46,00:28:49,It's Quebec Sign Language.
458,00:28:51,00:28:59,"Sign language is just like any other language-- it varies by... region, has its own dialect, slang..."
459,00:28:59,00:29:03,"Oh, I know that, but Sean is from England-- why would he be speaking Quebecoise?"
460,00:29:05,00:29:10,Maybe he spent some time in Quebec and picked up some of the slang.
461,00:29:10,00:29:12,It's possible.
462,00:29:12,00:29:17,"When Gil and I first got back from Europe, there were certain phrases that stuck with me for a while, too."
463,00:29:18,00:29:20,Don't you miss it?
464,00:29:20,00:29:21,Europe?
465,00:29:23,00:29:25,Being with your husband.
466,00:29:28,00:29:30,What kind of marriage do you have?
467,00:29:30,00:29:31,You two barely even see each other.
468,00:29:31,00:29:33,You don't even live in the same town.
469,00:29:33,00:29:36,"We talk every day, we see each other at least once a month."
470,00:29:36,00:29:38,That is not a marriage.
471,00:29:38,00:29:41,I lost my husband too soon.
472,00:29:41,00:29:46,"But in all the years that we were married, we never spent one night apart."
473,00:29:46,00:29:51,"It's unconventional, but what Gil and I have works."
474,00:29:51,00:29:53,We love each other.
475,00:29:53,00:29:55,"We're a family, and..."
476,00:29:55,00:29:58,"You know what, if... if you don't want to be a part of it, that's your call."
477,00:30:41,00:30:47,STOKES:The bomb in Julia Holden's office used the same smokeless gunpowder as the bomb in Dr. Lambert's car.
478,00:30:47,00:30:49,No surprise.
479,00:30:49,00:30:54,Check this out-- this resistor keeps electricity from reaching the detonator for a specific amount of time.
480,00:30:54,00:30:56,"Now, in this case, ten minutes."
481,00:30:56,00:31:01,"SIDLE: Wow, that is not a lot of time to wrap and deliver the bomb before it exploded. No, it is not."
482,00:31:01,00:31:03,That's why the bomber used a remote to arm it.
483,00:31:03,00:31:10,So whoever wanted to blow up Julia Holden had to make sure that bomb was in her office and that she was there before they set that timer.
484,00:31:10,00:31:12,Bomber had to be nearby.
485,00:31:12,00:31:13,Try within earshot.
486,00:31:13,00:31:20,"When the bomber used the remote, it sent a signal to the receiver."
487,00:31:22,00:31:24,(beeping)
488,00:31:24,00:31:28,"Now, that beeping sound tells the bomber that the device is armed."
489,00:31:28,00:31:32,So whoever did this could hear just fine.
490,00:31:32,00:31:34,So Michael wasn't the bomber?
491,00:31:34,00:31:38,WILLOWS: We're looking for somebody outside the deaf community.
492,00:31:39,00:31:41,Yes and no.
493,00:31:43,00:31:47,I had nothing to do with that bomb in Julia's office.
494,00:31:48,00:31:50,I love her.
495,00:31:50,00:31:52,I'd never hurt her.
496,00:31:52,00:31:54,Then this lie detector test will prove it.
497,00:31:56,00:32:00,SIDLE: We're gonna show you a series of pictures and measure your brain's response.
498,00:32:00,00:32:02,Are you ready?
499,00:32:04,00:32:05,Go ahead.
500,00:32:11,00:32:12,"(electronic oscillations, clicking)"
501,00:32:12,00:32:15,He recollects Julia Holden.
502,00:32:20,00:32:23,"(electronic oscillations, clicks, pops)"
503,00:32:24,00:32:27,No recollection of the bomb materials.
504,00:32:29,00:32:32,"(electronic tones, clicking)"
505,00:32:32,00:32:34,No recollection of the bombing.
506,00:32:37,00:32:40,"Sean, I've got some bad news-- you failed."
507,00:32:45,00:32:47,I didn't set that bomb.
508,00:32:47,00:32:49,The machine's inaccurate-- everybody knows that.
509,00:32:49,00:32:53,"Well, you're right, Sean, uh, polygraphs aren't reliable."
510,00:32:53,00:32:55,Thank you very much. It's okay.
511,00:32:55,00:33:00,"But we didn't give you a polygraph, we gave you an Auditory Evoked Potential Test."
512,00:33:00,00:33:03,It actually measures your brain's response to sound.
513,00:33:03,00:33:05,"During the test, we played a series of clicking sounds."
514,00:33:05,00:33:09,"You acted as though you didn't hear them, but your brain said otherwise."
515,00:33:09,00:33:14,The spikes in your brain wave indicate that you hear just fine.
516,00:33:14,00:33:16,"You're not deaf, Sean. You're a fraud."
517,00:33:16,00:33:18,You're also a killer.
518,00:33:25,00:33:28,"Sean Wyatt still isn't talking, with or without an interpreter."
519,00:33:28,00:33:31,So he faked being deaf for the half-a-million dollar grant.
520,00:33:31,00:33:35,"And if Dr. Lambert found out that he was a fraud, that would be motive for murder right there."
521,00:33:35,00:33:39,"Well, Sean lied about being deaf; makes you wonder what else he's lying about."
522,00:33:58,00:34:03,"SIDLE: His real name is Sean Wyatt Leblanc, and he's not from England he's from Canada-- Montreal to be exact."
523,00:34:03,00:34:05,And he lied about everything.
524,00:34:05,00:34:08,Including being deaf.
525,00:34:08,00:34:10,It's not possible.
526,00:34:10,00:34:12,We gave him an Auditory Evoked Potential Test.
527,00:34:12,00:34:13,He can hear.
528,00:34:15,00:34:22,"It can't be easy to fool an entire campus of deaf students including a smart, savvy professor."
529,00:34:22,00:34:25,One that he was intimately involved with.
530,00:34:25,00:34:27,Are you saying that I knew?
531,00:34:27,00:34:34,"Sean's transcripts were forged using paper with a Gilbert College watermark, which means that he had help from someone inside the school."
532,00:34:34,00:34:37,"No. When I met Sean, he was already a student."
533,00:34:39,00:34:42,I was his thesis advisor.
534,00:34:42,00:34:46,We started spending a lot of time together.
535,00:34:47,00:34:51,"One night, we were working late and he kissed me."
536,00:34:56,00:35:00,I should have put a stop to it.
537,00:35:00,00:35:09,"But when a young, good-looking guy tells you that you're beautiful and he can't get enough of you, you want to believe it."
538,00:35:10,00:35:13,I fell in love with him.
539,00:35:13,00:35:17,I haven't felt that for a long time.
540,00:35:17,00:35:22,"With all that time that you and Sean spent together, you never suspected that he could hear?"
541,00:35:26,00:35:28,There was a time that I saw him sign something wrong.
542,00:35:28,00:35:30,It was Quebec Sign Language.
543,00:35:30,00:35:32,And I asked him about it.
544,00:35:32,00:35:37,He said that it was our secret term of endearment.
545,00:35:37,00:35:40,Something that no one on the campus would understand.
546,00:35:42,00:35:46,My career has been my life.
547,00:35:49,00:35:51,I didn't realize how lonely I was.
548,00:35:55,00:36:05,We... we all have this need to find that one person to connect with.
549,00:36:05,00:36:15,"And when we do, we find that we're overlooking their imperfections and disappointments."
550,00:36:16,00:36:18,He was using me.
551,00:36:20,00:36:22,"I'm sorry, Julia."
552,00:36:25,00:36:28,Is there anything that you know about Sean?
553,00:36:28,00:36:30,Anything that might help us?
554,00:36:35,00:36:41,One night I did go into his room-- while he was e-mailing-- and e was using a different e-mail address.
555,00:36:41,00:36:42,It was in French.
556,00:36:42,00:36:45,I thought maybe it was another girl.
557,00:36:45,00:36:47,"He said, no, it was just an old friend."
558,00:36:47,00:36:49,Do you know who he was writing to?
559,00:36:49,00:36:51,No.
560,00:36:54,00:36:58,But I do remember the e-mail address that he was using.
561,00:37:00,00:37:03,I got an A.G. waiver on the e-mail account that Julia gave us. Oh.
562,00:37:03,00:37:08,"The e-mail's practically a blueprint for the entire grant scam, starting with getting accepted to the school."
563,00:37:08,00:37:10,And finishing with the bombings?
564,00:37:10,00:37:12,"No, but there was a threat implied."
565,00:37:12,00:37:14,Sean was clearly worried that Dr. Lambert was on to him.
566,00:37:14,00:37:17,He and his partner knew they had to do something.
567,00:37:17,00:37:18,Who's his partner?
568,00:37:18,00:37:19,His cousin from Montreal.
569,00:37:19,00:37:22,"But fortunately, we don't have to go that far to find him."
570,00:37:22,00:37:25,He's been hiding in plain sight.
571,00:37:25,00:37:27,BRASS: Dennis Palmer.
572,00:37:27,00:37:29,"It must feel a little lonely, huh, Dennis?"
573,00:37:29,00:37:31,Being an interpreter for the deaf?
574,00:37:31,00:37:35,"I mean, you're part of everyone's intimate conversations, but somehow you're on the outside."
575,00:37:35,00:37:37,"You're... you know, you're like..."
576,00:37:37,00:37:38,Invisible?
577,00:37:38,00:37:40,Yeah-- invisible. Exactly.
578,00:37:40,00:37:42,It's part of the job.
579,00:37:42,00:37:46,"It's also part of the job to have access to all the buildings on campus, including Julia Holden's office."
580,00:37:46,00:37:52,We checked. You used your key card to enter Julia's building 30 minutes before the explosion.
581,00:37:52,00:37:54,I was dropping a transcript off in Dr. Gardner's... We searched your room.
582,00:37:54,00:37:58,"You know, for an invisible man, you leave a lot of evidence behind."
583,00:37:58,00:38:00,We found receipts for gunpowder and pipes.
584,00:38:00,00:38:02,We knew you were at the party with Dr. Lambert.
585,00:38:02,00:38:04,So you planted that bomb under his car.
586,00:38:11,00:38:16,You dropped off the package that Michael Porter delivered to Julia's office.
587,00:38:16,00:38:17,(beeping)
588,00:38:17,00:38:20,"When we searched your room, we found e-mails between you and Sean."
589,00:38:20,00:38:22,Now we know this whole con was your idea.
590,00:38:22,00:38:24,You're the inside guy.
591,00:38:24,00:38:25,You forged his transcript.
592,00:38:25,00:38:28,Did you teach him how to sign as well?
593,00:38:28,00:38:30,I learned sign language as a kid.
594,00:38:30,00:38:32,My mother's deaf.
595,00:38:32,00:38:36,"So Dennis got you into the school, and you agreed to split the cash with him, right?"
596,00:38:36,00:38:38,It was easy money.
597,00:38:38,00:38:41,Dennis said they were just giving it away.
598,00:38:41,00:38:44,"You know, if you're in a wheelchair or you're deaf, society throws money at you."
599,00:38:44,00:38:47,"I mean, they have all these grants for deaf students."
600,00:38:47,00:38:50,"Meanwhile, I'm working my ass off for next to nothing."
601,00:38:50,00:38:52,So you thought you'd bilk the system.
602,00:38:52,00:38:53,But you got greedy.
603,00:38:53,00:38:58,"You went after the big prize-- the half-a-million dollar grant, right?"
604,00:38:58,00:39:01,"A prize that big, we needed an edge."
605,00:39:01,00:39:02,Is that why you seduced Julia?
606,00:39:02,00:39:04,I needed her endorsement.
607,00:39:05,00:39:08,But then I started to care about her.
608,00:39:08,00:39:10,That was the first complication.
609,00:39:10,00:39:11,And Lambert was the second.
610,00:39:11,00:39:13,Lambert found out I didn't go to Cambridge.
611,00:39:13,00:39:19,Said he wouldn't go to the police if I withdrew my grant application and left the school.
612,00:39:19,00:39:22,"So you thought if you get rid of Lambert, you might still have a shot at the big money."
613,00:39:22,00:39:25,Thought we could make it look like an accident.
614,00:39:25,00:39:27,"But why the second bomb? I mean, why target Julia?"
615,00:39:27,00:39:29,"I was trying to take the heat off of Sean, put it on Michael."
616,00:39:29,00:39:31,Dennis promised me that Julia wouldn't get hurt.
617,00:39:31,00:39:33,Said she wouldn't even be in her office.
618,00:39:33,00:39:37,And you believed him.
619,00:40:01,00:40:03,(no voice): I'm sorry.
620,00:40:08,00:40:10,You all right?
621,00:40:32,00:40:35,GRISSOM: The graves were littered with pupa casings.
622,00:40:35,00:40:38,Looked like somebody dumped a ton of Rice Krispies on top of a bunch of Halloween skeletons.
623,00:40:38,00:40:40,(laughs)
624,00:40:40,00:40:42,It indicated that it wasn't a proper burial.
625,00:40:42,00:40:44,"During the Inca period, there was no great punishment."
626,00:40:44,00:40:49,We think it was meant as a warning-- don't mess with the Moche.
627,00:40:49,00:40:50,Aha.
628,00:40:50,00:40:52,"So anyway, how a was your week? What'd you do?"
629,00:40:52,00:40:54,"Well, I almost got blown up twice."
630,00:40:54,00:40:56,I accused your ex-girlfriend of murder.
631,00:40:56,00:40:58,"And, oh, I... I told off your mother."
632,00:40:58,00:41:01,"Oh, good. You kept busy."
633,00:41:01,00:41:03,Yeah. See what happens when you stand me up?
634,00:41:03,00:41:05,Who's that?
635,00:41:05,00:41:06,"Uh, it's your mother."
636,00:41:08,00:41:10,"Hi, Mom."
637,00:41:10,00:41:14,You never came to the office when I was working there.
638,00:41:14,00:41:17,I heard you and Sara had an exciting week.
639,00:41:24,00:41:28,African violets.
640,00:41:28,00:41:29,They're beautiful.
641,00:41:29,00:41:32,I told her you liked vegetation.
642,00:41:33,00:41:35,Thank you.
643,00:41:35,00:41:38,"Um, I'm sorry, too."
644,00:41:39,00:41:42,Can we start over?
645,00:41:45,00:41:49,"When I come back, the three of us will go out to dinner."
646,00:41:50,00:41:52,Soon.
647,00:42:00,00:42:05,Your mother is talking about our sex life.
648,00:42:05,00:42:13,"In Incan society, the Moche elders would pass down their knowledge of sexual pleasure to the younger generation."
649,00:42:13,00:42:18,Their stories were documented on their pottery.
650,00:42:18,00:42:24,"Little ceramic jars called ""sex pots."" Sex pots."
651,00:42:29,00:42:32,Sometimes too much.
652,00:42:32,00:42:34,Love you both.
653,00:42:34,00:42:36,"Love you, too."
654,00:42:36,00:42:37,Bye.
