0,00:00:00,00:00:02,Previously on CSI...
1,00:00:02,00:00:05,"FINLAY: Jared Briscoe, the Gig Harbor Killer."
2,00:00:05,00:00:07,SHAW: Who knew that psychopath Briscoe had a twin?
3,00:00:07,00:00:09,Plans change. I'll even have a little gift for you.
4,00:00:09,00:00:10,Maya.
5,00:00:10,00:00:12,BRODY: The prints came back to Daniel Shaw.
6,00:00:12,00:00:14,Shaw is Winthrop's partner.
7,00:00:14,00:00:17,FINLAY: All of our victims are involved in the sex trade. We never knew who was pimping them out.
8,00:00:17,00:00:18,Why are you doing this?
9,00:00:18,00:00:20,SHAW: We had a deal. Where's my daughter?
10,00:00:20,00:00:21,Amy. Dad. Run!
11,00:00:21,00:00:23,(gunshot) (shouts)
12,00:00:23,00:00:24,(grunting)
13,00:00:24,00:00:27,"SIDLE: Briscoe's dead and Winthrop's on the run, a fugitive."
14,00:00:27,00:00:28,RUSSELL: No.
15,00:00:28,00:00:30,Animals are most dangerous when they're cornered.
16,00:00:56,00:00:58,(buzzing)
17,00:01:30,00:01:33,I don't understand...
18,00:01:33,00:01:34,any of this.
19,00:01:34,00:01:37,Why am I here?
20,00:01:37,00:01:38,This was not the plan.
21,00:01:38,00:01:43,"You said if I make a sacrifice, in return, I would live forever."
22,00:01:45,00:01:47,Look at me.
23,00:01:47,00:01:52,Look in my eyes. My eyes are your eyes.
24,00:01:52,00:01:55,My heart is your heart.
25,00:02:04,00:02:05,"Hey, D.B. I heard you..."
26,00:02:05,00:02:08,"Whoa. How long's it been? Like, a week?"
27,00:02:08,00:02:11,Yeah. My wife's not too crazy about it.
28,00:02:11,00:02:16,"She'd like to see me all cleaned up like you. Yeah, well, there's something to be said for a close shave, yeah."
29,00:02:16,00:02:21,I spoke with Ecklie. He and I both heard from the lab director down in San Diego.
30,00:02:21,00:02:23,I didn't know he was actually gonna call you guys.
31,00:02:23,00:02:27,He did more than that. He put you on the top of the list of candidates to succeed him.
32,00:02:27,00:02:29,"No, he shouldn't have done that. Why not?"
33,00:02:29,00:02:32,It sounds like a good opportunity.
34,00:02:32,00:02:34,You trying to kick me out of here now?
35,00:02:34,00:02:39,Last thing I want is you leaving. But I would support you making the move. FINLAY: Sorry to interrupt.
36,00:02:39,00:02:42,"I sent the samples over to Hodges, and I'm heading out."
37,00:02:42,00:02:44,All right. See you later.
38,00:02:58,00:03:00,"Mom, what did you get me this time?"
39,00:03:15,00:03:17,Castor and Pollux.
40,00:03:17,00:03:18,The twins.
41,00:03:23,00:03:24,(gasps)
42,00:03:24,00:03:27,(phone ringing)
43,00:03:31,00:03:33,WINTHROP: Did you get my present?
44,00:03:33,00:03:35,"If you wanted my attention, you've got it."
45,00:03:35,00:03:37,"Oh, I want more than your attention."
46,00:03:37,00:03:39,Because this is just the beginning.
47,00:03:39,00:03:41,Or should I say...
48,00:03:41,00:03:43,the beginning of the end.
49,00:04:20,00:04:26,"That son of a bitch put my mother's name on the package, so I had to get the Philly cops to put protection on her house."
50,00:04:26,00:04:31,"Yeah, as soon as I got your call, I did the same with Maya and with Barbara."
51,00:04:31,00:04:32,So what do you think it all means?
52,00:04:32,00:04:41,"Mythology says that when Castor was killed, Pollux went to Zeus and asked him to let him share his own immortality with his twin."
53,00:04:41,00:04:42,To keep them together.
54,00:04:42,00:04:46,"Zeus agreed, and so they were cast into heaven."
55,00:04:46,00:04:47,The constellation Gemini.
56,00:04:47,00:04:53,So cutting off his finger is part of the message that he and his brother are now one?
57,00:04:53,00:04:57,"RUSSELL: He's saying we may have taken his brother, but he's more powerful than ever."
58,00:04:57,00:05:07,"All very interesting, you guys, but here on planet Earth, I thought Winthrop had a partner while his brother was in custody. Didn't you hear another set of footsteps on the recording of Pamela Kramer's murder?"
59,00:05:07,00:05:13,"We did. And you don't think it's Daniel Shaw? I mean, come on, this whole thing with the estranged daughter could still have been a setup."
60,00:05:13,00:05:15,It was not a setup. You sure about that?
61,00:05:15,00:05:21,I am. Then why is Shaw's lawyer saying his client has information on Winthrop that he's willing to trade for a deal?
62,00:05:21,00:05:23,It's the first I'm hearing this.
63,00:05:23,00:05:24,"Yeah, me, too."
64,00:05:24,00:05:27,Guess I need to go talk to Shaw.
65,00:05:27,00:05:28,I checked with World-Send.
66,00:05:28,00:05:30,The tracking number and the bar code were bogus.
67,00:05:30,00:05:33,I'm guessing that Winthrop faked them.
68,00:05:34,00:05:36,You got something?
69,00:05:36,00:05:37,"Yeah, we've seen this before."
70,00:05:37,00:05:40,The strings are made of human tissue. Take a look there.
71,00:05:40,00:05:43,"SIDLE: Yeah, thinner gauge than the trajectory strings but same idea."
72,00:05:43,00:05:46,"We'll have Henry confirm, see if DNA can tell us who it is."
73,00:05:46,00:05:47,Sounds good.
74,00:05:47,00:05:49,"Hey, let me ask you something."
75,00:05:49,00:05:50,Is this about San Diego?
76,00:05:50,00:05:52,Because Finn mentioned something.
77,00:05:52,00:05:55,"Yeah, Nolan is stepping down as the lab director there."
78,00:05:55,00:05:58,"And, um, he seems to think I'll make a good replacement."
79,00:05:58,00:06:00,Wow. You would.
80,00:06:00,00:06:01,Yeah.
81,00:06:01,00:06:02,So what's the problem?
82,00:06:02,00:06:06,"(chuckling): It's just like I said, I have a lot of friends here, and..."
83,00:06:06,00:06:07,it's a big responsibility.
84,00:06:07,00:06:08,"Yeah, but there's a beach."
85,00:06:08,00:06:10,And it's a four-and-a-half-hour drive.
86,00:06:10,00:06:12,You'd see me all the time.
87,00:06:13,00:06:17,"You know, Sara, after all these years, I realize what's important to me."
88,00:06:17,00:06:20,It's not a promotion.
89,00:06:20,00:06:22,Well...
90,00:06:22,00:06:23,you know what Grissom would say.
91,00:06:25,00:06:28,You gotta go where you can do the most good.
92,00:06:32,00:06:33,"SHAW: This is what you got, huh?"
93,00:06:33,00:06:35,How many times I got to tell you I am not doing this?
94,00:06:35,00:06:37,I'm not playing the game. I don't want a deal.
95,00:06:37,00:06:41,"I want to cooperate. If you can't get that through your thick head, there's the door."
96,00:06:41,00:06:42,Fine.
97,00:06:46,00:06:48,Need a new lawyer? Yeah.
98,00:06:48,00:06:50,Looks like I'll be representing myself from here on in.
99,00:06:50,00:06:52,"Yeah, I don't think that's the best plan."
100,00:06:52,00:06:54,Why break a losing streak?
101,00:06:54,00:06:58,So I've heard that you have information that you'd like to trade for a deal.
102,00:06:58,00:07:01,"Yeah, that wasn't my idea. That was my lawyer's."
103,00:07:02,00:07:05,"Besides, I'd rather talk to you."
104,00:07:05,00:07:10,"I'm listening. Look, I know your boss, the sheriff, he thinks that I'm Winthrop's partner."
105,00:07:10,00:07:11,That's just not true.
106,00:07:11,00:07:13,I know that.
107,00:07:13,00:07:16,"But given everything that happened, it's pretty hard to make that case."
108,00:07:16,00:07:19,Not if you and I can find the real coconspirator.
109,00:07:21,00:07:28,"Before Winthrop abducted my daughter, I was working on a lead. I figured his-his partner was helping him get the girls, the victims."
110,00:07:28,00:07:29,Through the escort service.
111,00:07:29,00:07:30,Exactly.
112,00:07:30,00:07:33,I thought Rebecca Lowell ran Lady Aquarius.
113,00:07:33,00:07:33,She did.
114,00:07:33,00:07:35,But she had a connection here in Las Vegas.
115,00:07:35,00:07:42,The important thing is this same guy was getting a lot of money from Winthrop's company.
116,00:07:42,00:07:43,Who is it?
117,00:07:43,00:07:45,He's not gonna talk to you.
118,00:07:45,00:07:46,But he will speak to me.
119,00:07:46,00:07:48,Are you asking me what I think you're asking me?
120,00:07:48,00:07:51,"You get me a 48-hour pass, you and I can nail this guy."
121,00:07:51,00:07:53,Sheriff already doesn't trust you.
122,00:07:53,00:07:56,You do. Just a little bit.
123,00:07:56,00:08:01,"I'm gonna need a name. Well, it's someone you've had a run-in with before."
124,00:08:01,00:08:03,A certain preacher-pimp.
125,00:08:03,00:08:05,Goes by the name of Brother Larson.
126,00:08:06,00:08:07,WOMAN: I can't go back up there.
127,00:08:07,00:08:10,I can't even look at that man. Calm down.
128,00:08:10,00:08:12,"Brother Larson is here, and Brother Larson is listening."
129,00:08:12,00:08:16,"Now, you tell me, did he hurt you?"
130,00:08:16,00:08:18,No. He didn't touch me.
131,00:08:18,00:08:23,"And that's just it, I don't want him to touch me. All right, then let's talk about that."
132,00:08:23,00:08:24,You don't want him to touch you how?
133,00:08:24,00:08:29,I came to you. I came to your church because I wanted to get out of the game.
134,00:08:29,00:08:30,I don't want to do this anymore.
135,00:08:30,00:08:32,"I hear you, baby. I feel you."
136,00:08:32,00:08:36,But here's the thing. Here's the Word.
137,00:08:36,00:08:38,Our Creator...
138,00:08:38,00:08:41,He's bestowed upon us gifts. You...
139,00:08:41,00:08:43,have a gift.
140,00:08:43,00:08:49,The only shame there is in life is squandering our gifts. You feel me?
141,00:08:49,00:08:51,I guess.
142,00:08:51,00:08:55,"Here's what we're gonna do. You're gonna go home, get some sleep."
143,00:08:55,00:08:57,You're gonna forget about tonight.
144,00:08:57,00:08:59,I will see you in the morning.
145,00:08:59,00:09:02,I'll bring you some breakfast.
146,00:09:02,00:09:03,One more thing.
147,00:09:05,00:09:08,Did that man give you an envelope?
148,00:09:10,00:09:12,"Bless you, baby doll."
149,00:09:14,00:09:15,(engine starts) Get out of here.
150,00:09:19,00:09:21,"Damn, you're good, Larson."
151,00:09:21,00:09:24,And you're taking liberties with my car.
152,00:09:24,00:09:26,"Been a while, Daniel."
153,00:09:26,00:09:28,I been reading the papers.
154,00:09:28,00:09:30,You been in the lions' den.
155,00:09:30,00:09:34,Surprised to see you. Police think I'm Winthrop's partner. They think I'm a killer.
156,00:09:34,00:09:36,But you know me. You know that's not true.
157,00:09:36,00:09:37,And how would I know that?
158,00:09:37,00:09:39,Because I know about the money.
159,00:09:39,00:09:41,I used to help you and your business in the past.
160,00:09:41,00:09:43,Now it's your turn to help me.
161,00:09:43,00:09:45,Unless you want me to give this information to the police.
162,00:09:45,00:09:48,"I always liked you, Daniel."
163,00:09:48,00:09:49,Always trusted you.
164,00:09:49,00:09:51,Until now.
165,00:09:51,00:09:58,Tell me something. Do they shave you down there before they tape that little wire onto you? I'm not wearing a wire.
166,00:09:58,00:10:00,Then I'm guessing...
167,00:10:00,00:10:02,we're not alone.
168,00:10:02,00:10:05,"You guessed right. CSI Finlay, as I recall."
169,00:10:05,00:10:07,Was all this really necessary?
170,00:10:07,00:10:09,I've always been a friend of the police.
171,00:10:09,00:10:11,I've helped you before. All you had to do is ask.
172,00:10:11,00:10:13,"All right, then I'll ask."
173,00:10:13,00:10:15,Are you Winthrop's partner in all of these murders?
174,00:10:15,00:10:18,Direct. I like that. The answer's no.
175,00:10:18,00:10:19,The cops are onto the money trail.
176,00:10:19,00:10:21,They know you provided the girls.
177,00:10:21,00:10:24,"Help us find Winthrop, and maybe you won't get the death penalty."
178,00:10:24,00:10:27,Being misjudged has been my constant cross to bear.
179,00:10:27,00:10:30,"Yes, I provided escorts. It's what I do."
180,00:10:30,00:10:31,And I received a finder's fee.
181,00:10:31,00:10:33,Also what I do.
182,00:10:33,00:10:36,What I don't do is harm women. Or anyone.
183,00:10:36,00:10:37,All right? All right.
184,00:10:37,00:10:38,I guess I'll just have to arrest you.
185,00:10:38,00:10:42,"H-Hold on a minute. I said I was gonna help, I'll help."
186,00:10:42,00:10:45,"The money I got, it didn't come from the son. It came from the father."
187,00:10:45,00:10:47,Collin Winthrop.
188,00:10:47,00:10:55,"In fact, when the first girls went missing, I suspected him, but, uh, given events, I see now how this could be a family business."
189,00:10:55,00:10:57,You're saying the father's the partner?
190,00:10:57,00:10:59,That'd be my suspicion.
191,00:10:59,00:11:01,Sometimes the apple doesn't fall from the tree at all.
192,00:11:01,00:11:04,So say we believe you. Where can we find Paul Winthrop's father?
193,00:11:04,00:11:07,I stopped dealing with Collin a long time ago.
194,00:11:07,00:11:12,I do still receive contributions to preserve his good name.
195,00:11:12,00:11:14,It's called extortion.
196,00:11:14,00:11:15,That is such an ugly word.
197,00:11:15,00:11:22,"Look, if you guys want to arrest me, go ahead, but know that my lawyer will have me out and about in a Las Vegas minute."
198,00:11:22,00:11:25,You good? You good?
199,00:11:25,00:11:27,"Me, too."
200,00:11:32,00:11:33,Got your text.
201,00:11:33,00:11:35,Please tell me you have answers.
202,00:11:35,00:11:38,"Well, let's start with the finger in the jar."
203,00:11:38,00:11:45,"Now, it turns out the finger was not suspended in saline and blood-- as I expected-- but saline and something else."
204,00:11:45,00:11:48,I sent it off to Hodges for analysis.
205,00:11:48,00:11:52,And you're sure that it's Paul Winthrop's finger. It is.
206,00:11:52,00:11:54,And the story would end there.
207,00:11:54,00:11:57,"Except I found blood on the statuette. Well, Paul Winthrop's blood, right?"
208,00:11:57,00:11:59,That's what I thought.
209,00:11:59,00:12:04,"And because we're dealing with twins, in order to distinguish them, I ran an antibodies profile."
210,00:12:04,00:12:08,"Not only was it not Winthrop, but the sample was female."
211,00:12:08,00:12:10,"Two females, to be exact."
212,00:12:10,00:12:12,Identical twins.
213,00:12:12,00:12:19,"How much blood did you find? Well, there were only a couple of usable traces for testing, but take a look."
214,00:12:31,00:12:34,He wasn't just sending us a message.
215,00:12:34,00:12:37,Winthrop sent us a murder weapon.
216,00:12:45,00:12:46,You got to be kidding.
217,00:12:46,00:12:48,(chuckles) I know.
218,00:12:48,00:12:50,"It's not really me, is it?"
219,00:12:50,00:12:53,"Yeah, I picked up these sleeves at the costume shop down the block."
220,00:12:54,00:12:57,Just wanted to see what it would feel like to be a serial killer.
221,00:12:59,00:13:04,So I pulled the booking photo of Jared Briscoe's tats.
222,00:13:04,00:13:13,"Now, this liquid that Winthrop sent us his severed finger in is a mixture of saline solution and Cryers #2 Vermillion Ink."
223,00:13:13,00:13:15,Let me guess. Used in tattoos.
224,00:13:15,00:13:17,"Well, not just any tattoos."
225,00:13:17,00:13:19,These tattoos.
226,00:13:19,00:13:25,I've discovered in my research that certain tattoo artists are quite particular about which inks they use.
227,00:13:25,00:13:27,And Cryers #2 Vermillion is very rare.
228,00:13:27,00:13:37,"So rare, in fact, that I was able to identify Briscoe's artist. Okay, but what does that have to do with the jar of ink that Winthrop sent us?"
229,00:13:37,00:13:40,Briscoe's artist lives in Seattle.
230,00:13:40,00:13:47,He has an ex-wife who moved to Vegas last year to live with her twin sister.
231,00:13:47,00:13:53,Henry found blood on the Castor and Pollux statuette consistent with identical twins.
232,00:13:53,00:13:55,Unknown females.
233,00:13:55,00:13:57,Not unknown now.
234,00:13:57,00:14:00,I've got names and an address.
235,00:14:00,00:14:03,Building manager confirmed the loft's rented to Amelia Vance.
236,00:14:03,00:14:04,What about the sister?
237,00:14:04,00:14:07,Name's Margo. She signed onto the lease a year ago.
238,00:14:07,00:14:11,Manager said he stopped by yesterday 'cause they complained the AC wasn't working.
239,00:14:11,00:14:12,No one answered.
240,00:14:17,00:14:19,"Amelia Vance, LVPD."
241,00:14:42,00:14:44,SIDLE: Another processed crime scene.
242,00:14:52,00:14:55,Strings and blood suggest two events.
243,00:14:55,00:14:56,Two victims.
244,00:14:58,00:15:00,"Again, he took the bodies."
245,00:15:04,00:15:06,Russell's theory was right.
246,00:15:08,00:15:11,Winthrop and his brother have become one.
247,00:15:11,00:15:13,Dead ringers.
248,00:15:16,00:15:19,Just like old times.
249,00:15:19,00:15:21,"Everything's been dusted, everything's already processed."
250,00:15:21,00:15:23,Something is different this time.
251,00:15:23,00:15:24,What do you mean?
252,00:15:24,00:15:30,"Well, not everything's been dusted, and these green strings-- Gemini?"
253,00:15:30,00:15:33,He didn't even try to hide them among the other strings.
254,00:15:33,00:15:34,"Different murder weapon, too."
255,00:15:34,00:15:37,"No gaff. This time, he bludgeoned them to death with a marble sculpture."
256,00:15:37,00:15:39,And this rope he used?
257,00:15:39,00:15:42,Never seen anything like it.
258,00:15:42,00:15:43,Looks hand-braided.
259,00:15:43,00:15:45,Unusual fiber.
260,00:15:45,00:15:49,Some kind of powdery trace on it. It's yellow.
261,00:15:49,00:15:52,It looks organic in nature. Suggests secondary transfer.
262,00:15:52,00:15:54,How's it going with your new toy?
263,00:15:54,00:15:56,"Oh, camera's acquired the image."
264,00:15:56,00:15:58,Just loading it now.
265,00:15:58,00:16:00,So this thing is gonna give us T.O.D.
266,00:16:00,00:16:07,"on our victims? Well, it's worth a try. We've had this hyperspectral imaging prototype in the lab for over a month."
267,00:16:07,00:16:09,I've been waiting to field-test it.
268,00:16:09,00:16:14,"How's it work, exactly? Well, it's all about the hemoglobin in the blood."
269,00:16:14,00:16:18,"As a bloodstain ages, the blood reacts with oxygen and breaks down."
270,00:16:18,00:16:24,"Right, which is why blood changes color from red to brown. Well, this camera records those changes."
271,00:16:24,00:16:27,And then maps them on a visible reflectance spectrum.
272,00:16:27,00:16:33,So here is the crime scene blood drop. I'm comparing it to a preset baseline of a fresh blood drop.
273,00:16:33,00:16:36,Software does the rest.
274,00:16:36,00:16:41,"Calculating the difference between the two spectra, thereby computing the age of the blood."
275,00:16:41,00:16:42,Wow.
276,00:16:42,00:16:45,Oh. And... we got our answer.
277,00:16:45,00:16:47,The murders took place...
278,00:16:47,00:16:49,12 hours ago.
279,00:16:49,00:16:59,"So something is different. Yeah, I mean, the other murders took place weeks before we discovered the crime scenes. And he took days to stage them. Winthrop has accelerated his time frame."
280,00:16:59,00:17:01,But why?
281,00:17:06,00:17:11,"If anything holds from the past, I'm sure he's eager to tell us."
282,00:17:11,00:17:14,"DISTORTED VOICE: Clearly, our killer's behavior has altered."
283,00:17:14,00:17:15,Two victims this time.
284,00:17:15,00:17:18,Female. Not college age.
285,00:17:18,00:17:20,Selected for other purposes.
286,00:17:20,00:17:22,One being a tattoo artist.
287,00:17:22,00:17:29,Elementary profiling would say the killer's psychosexual fixation has given way to a transformative agenda.
288,00:17:29,00:17:32,"WINTHROP: Is that what you'd say, Mr. Russell?"
289,00:17:32,00:17:36,"Games are over, right? We can finally be honest with each other."
290,00:17:36,00:17:38,I'm sure you've realized your mistake.
291,00:17:38,00:17:40,It's one others have made.
292,00:17:40,00:17:43,"From the very beginning, this world tried to separate Jared and me."
293,00:17:43,00:17:47,So many have paid for that injustice.
294,00:17:47,00:17:50,But those truly responsible have escaped our wrath.
295,00:17:50,00:17:52,Until now.
296,00:17:52,00:17:57,So I ran audio analysis. There's no evidence of anyone else on the recording.
297,00:17:57,00:17:59,He has to have somebody else helping him.
298,00:17:59,00:18:03,"And it's not his brother's ghost. Right, I mean, the guy was wounded."
299,00:18:03,00:18:05,So he had to lay low. Somebody's been hiding him.
300,00:18:05,00:18:09,"Mm-hmm. He also doesn't have any access to his bank accounts, so..."
301,00:18:09,00:18:11,somebody has to be supporting him.
302,00:18:11,00:18:14,"Larson says that it's Winthrop's father, Collin."
303,00:18:14,00:18:16,Do you believe him?
304,00:18:16,00:18:20,"All right, I'm going to follow up on both of them."
305,00:18:20,00:18:23,You were right about the rope from the crime scene.
306,00:18:23,00:18:27,It's unusual. Definitely not your standard bondage gear.
307,00:18:27,00:18:31,"If anything, it tends more towards a fetish of gardening."
308,00:18:31,00:18:32,Gardening?
309,00:18:32,00:18:36,You are looking here at a handwoven plant fiber.
310,00:18:36,00:18:39,Specifically Apocynum cannabinium.
311,00:18:39,00:18:41,Otherwise known as dogbane.
312,00:18:41,00:18:43,It's an invasive species.
313,00:18:43,00:18:44,Grows like a weed almost anywhere.
314,00:18:44,00:18:46,"So, not particularly helpful."
315,00:18:46,00:18:48,No. But...
316,00:18:48,00:18:52,the trace that you pulled from the rope-- that's a different story.
317,00:18:52,00:18:56,You were also right-- it's organic.
318,00:18:56,00:19:01,These are pollen spores from a cactus called the Artemis bloom.
319,00:19:01,00:19:04,Artemis. Goddess of the hunt.
320,00:19:04,00:19:11,"Artemis was also the daughter of Zeus, twin sister to Apollo. So I'm thinking that perhaps it's another message. Probably."
321,00:19:11,00:19:13,Is there anything more you can tell me about the plant?
322,00:19:13,00:19:18,"Uh, the Artemis bloom is very rare, very delicate and also very expensive."
323,00:19:18,00:19:20,It's the ultimate hothouse flower.
324,00:19:20,00:19:23,Prized only by serious enthusiasts with deep pockets.
325,00:19:23,00:19:30,"Now you're talking. And you're thinking that if Winthrop isn't our flower enthusiast, perhaps he's spending time with someone who is."
326,00:19:30,00:19:33,Maybe his partner.
327,00:19:33,00:19:35,FINLAY: Collin Winthrop.
328,00:19:35,00:19:38,"Wealthy recluse, plant hobbyist."
329,00:19:38,00:19:39,Who spawned a bad seed.
330,00:19:39,00:19:41,Looks like our weekend botanist had some practice.
331,00:19:41,00:19:46,"Yeah, not just cultivating the sick impulses of his son, but seems to have some of his own."
332,00:19:46,00:19:51,2006. Legal secretary accused him of sexual assault.
333,00:19:51,00:19:53,Case never went to trial.
334,00:19:53,00:19:56,Rumors of more women and more allegations.
335,00:19:56,00:19:59,"Well, Larson's theory about Winthrop Sr. is getting better and better."
336,00:19:59,00:20:00,Mm. There's just one problem.
337,00:20:00,00:20:03,Says here that he reportedly fled to Mexico.
338,00:20:03,00:20:10,"Which means that he could still help his son from afar, but couldn't participate in the murders."
339,00:20:10,00:20:13,Unless Dad never left the country.
340,00:20:13,00:20:14,"These are my files, right?"
341,00:20:14,00:20:16,The ones from my hotel room after I was arrested?
342,00:20:16,00:20:17,"Yeah, why?"
343,00:20:17,00:20:29,"What have you got? Well, like I said, I was following the money. I was looking into the Winthrop company financials. I remember a series of transactions, donations to a nature conservancy. I thought it was a front, but..."
344,00:20:29,00:20:30,Here it is.
345,00:20:30,00:20:35,Tax records show there actually was a charity devoted to the preservation of exotic plant species.
346,00:20:35,00:20:39,How much you want to bet that money went straight into Papa Winthrop's pockets?
347,00:20:39,00:20:42,"Place is in Briar Creek, California."
348,00:20:42,00:20:45,San Diego County's a little out of your jurisdiction.
349,00:20:45,00:20:48,"You know, I think I know a guy who knows a guy."
350,00:21:05,00:21:06,(sighs)
351,00:21:06,00:21:08,"Hey, Finlay, what's your 20?"
352,00:21:08,00:21:10,Shaw and I are about five minutes out.
353,00:21:10,00:21:13,"All right, I'm gonna get the lay of the land out here and I'll call you back."
354,00:21:13,00:21:14,Copy that.
355,00:21:14,00:21:16,"You Ellis? Yes, sir."
356,00:21:16,00:21:17,"Good to meet you, CSI Stokes."
357,00:21:17,00:21:20,"(chuckles) Call me Nick, please."
358,00:21:20,00:21:21,I got it.
359,00:21:21,00:21:23,Lab Director Nolan said to extend you every courtesy.
360,00:21:23,00:21:26,"Did he? And from what I hear, I may be working for you full-time soon."
361,00:21:26,00:21:28,"Oh, we'll see about that."
362,00:21:28,00:21:29,What's the situation out here?
363,00:21:29,00:21:31,We've got the place surrounded.
364,00:21:31,00:21:33,Warrants in hand.
365,00:21:33,00:21:35,There's no activity in the main house.
366,00:21:35,00:21:37,But we have eyes on Collin Winthrop.
367,00:21:37,00:21:38,He's working in the greenhouse.
368,00:21:38,00:21:39,What about Paul?
369,00:21:39,00:21:47,"No sign of him. But my money's on the guesthouse. Shades are drawn, place is secluded, and has easy access to the back gate."
370,00:21:47,00:21:49,"Okay, why don't you and I take the guesthouse."
371,00:21:49,00:21:50,We'll have your team search the property.
372,00:21:50,00:21:54,"When my guys get here, they'll take Daddy Winthrop."
373,00:21:59,00:22:01,Collin Winthrop.
374,00:22:01,00:22:03,"I'm CSI Finlay, LVPD."
375,00:22:03,00:22:05,I have a warrant to search your property.
376,00:22:05,00:22:07,No warrant for my arrest?
377,00:22:07,00:22:08,SHAW: Depends on what we find.
378,00:22:08,00:22:11,What do you expect to find? Your son.
379,00:22:11,00:22:12,Uh-huh.
380,00:22:12,00:22:16,SHAW: Maybe some evidence linking the two of you to the five women who were murdered in Las Vegas.
381,00:22:16,00:22:17,My son and I are innocent.
382,00:22:17,00:22:19,"We are the victims here. Oh, yeah."
383,00:22:19,00:22:20,How do you figure that?
384,00:22:20,00:22:24,"Well, Paul and I share a natural appetite for..."
385,00:22:24,00:22:26,certain pleasures.
386,00:22:26,00:22:35,"Society may not approve, and the law may attempt to prohibit, but when they are both impotent to stop us, we are accused of brutalities."
387,00:22:35,00:22:38,Is that why you fled to Mexico?
388,00:22:38,00:22:46,It's not a crime for a man to want to abandon his life for a time and wander in the desert in search of beauty.
389,00:22:46,00:22:46,Like you see here.
390,00:22:46,00:22:49,"Mr. Winthrop, where is your son? You know..."
391,00:22:49,00:22:54,"if you're not going to arrest me, I would like you two to leave."
392,00:23:16,00:23:18,"STOKES: Oh, yeah, look at this."
393,00:23:18,00:23:19,Winthrop was licking his wounds.
394,00:23:44,00:23:46,"STOKES: Yeah, Winthrop was definitely here."
395,00:23:46,00:23:48,ELLIS: And he's gone now.
396,00:23:49,00:23:50,ELLIS: Freezer chest.
397,00:23:50,00:23:52,What do you think?
398,00:23:52,00:23:54,That's never good.
399,00:24:06,00:24:08,(creaking)
400,00:24:11,00:24:15,"(over radio): Finn, it's Nick-- I've got two bodies here in the guesthouse."
401,00:24:15,00:24:17,Twins. Copy that.
402,00:24:17,00:24:19,You're under arrest.
403,00:24:25,00:24:27,"SHAW: Well, there's half the battle."
404,00:24:27,00:24:29,FINLAY: It's not gonna help us find his son.
405,00:24:29,00:24:31,So we'll find him.
406,00:24:31,00:24:33,"(phone ringing) ""We""?"
407,00:24:33,00:24:36,You mean I'm never gonna get rid of you?
408,00:24:36,00:24:38,WINTHROP: I see you met dear old Dad.
409,00:24:38,00:24:44,"I know what you're thinking: ""chip off the old block."" But that's where you're wrong."
410,00:24:44,00:24:46,"Get down, everybody!"
411,00:24:46,00:24:47,(gunshot)
412,00:24:47,00:24:49,(frantic chatter)
413,00:24:49,00:24:50,Get down!
414,00:24:50,00:24:51,(gunshot) (grunts)
415,00:24:53,00:24:54,Daniel!
416,00:24:54,00:24:56,"(Shaw groaning in pain, Finlay gasping)"
417,00:24:56,00:24:57,"Oh, God!"
418,00:24:57,00:24:59,This is CSI Finlay.
419,00:24:59,00:25:01,"I need medical at my location, code three."
420,00:25:01,00:25:02,Get down.
421,00:25:02,00:25:03,The ambulance is gonna be here any minute.
422,00:25:03,00:25:05,"Come on, hold on."
423,00:25:05,00:25:06,Breathe.
424,00:25:06,00:25:09,Breathe! Breathe!
425,00:25:18,00:25:22,Found the sniper's nest on a ridge above the property 500 yards away.
426,00:25:22,00:25:24,He had a clear shot.
427,00:25:24,00:25:26,Did you scramble the search team?
428,00:25:26,00:25:28,Got every available unit on it.
429,00:25:28,00:25:31,"The problem is, Winthrop probably knows this area better than any of us."
430,00:25:31,00:25:33,Yep.
431,00:25:33,00:25:35,Gives him the upper hand.
432,00:25:35,00:25:37,You gonna process the rifle?
433,00:25:37,00:25:39,I thought you'd want to do it yourself.
434,00:25:42,00:25:44,RUSSELL (over phone): You sure you're okay?
435,00:25:44,00:25:46,"Yeah, I'm okay."
436,00:25:46,00:25:48,"D.B., Shaw took the bullet for me."
437,00:25:48,00:25:50,"I'm sorry, Jules."
438,00:25:50,00:25:53,Were you able to confirm that... that Winthrop was the shooter?
439,00:25:53,00:25:55,"Uh, Nick, uh, just processed the gun."
440,00:25:55,00:25:56,His prints are on it.
441,00:25:56,00:25:59,"Units are searching, but..."
442,00:25:59,00:26:00,still no sign of him.
443,00:26:00,00:26:02,Son of a bitch is long gone.
444,00:26:02,00:26:04,I'm gonna stay here and collect the evidence.
445,00:26:04,00:26:08,"Nick's coordinating with the San Diego crime lab to, uh, transport it all back to Vegas."
446,00:26:08,00:26:10,"No, no. You need to get back here now, Jules."
447,00:26:10,00:26:11,"I told you, I'm okay."
448,00:26:11,00:26:15,"No, you're lucky-- Winthrop's beyond targeting college girls now."
449,00:26:15,00:26:17,"He shot his father, and he tried to kill you."
450,00:26:17,00:26:19,This is getting personal.
451,00:26:19,00:26:20,I agree with Conrad.
452,00:26:20,00:26:24,"All right, I will transport Shaw's body and the others back to Doc."
453,00:26:24,00:26:27,"All right, but afterwards, you go straight home."
454,00:26:27,00:26:28,No arguments.
455,00:26:33,00:26:36,I confirmed C.O.D.'s on our female victims.
456,00:26:36,00:26:38,Blunt force trauma to the head.
457,00:26:38,00:26:41,"Women had so many fractures to the body and skull, I almost lost count."
458,00:26:41,00:26:47,ROBBINS: It's not just the blunt force trauma-- Winthrop's M.O.'s seemed to have changed as well.
459,00:26:47,00:26:51,"With his earlier victims, there's no sign of sexual activity."
460,00:26:51,00:26:52,You found semen?
461,00:26:52,00:26:54,Yeah. On both victims.
462,00:26:54,00:27:01,"ROBBINS: Latent bruising plus the ligature marks suggest, at the very least, rough sex. All right, let's get the DNA to Henry."
463,00:27:20,00:27:22,"Hello? Hi, Mrs. Devlin."
464,00:27:22,00:27:24,My name is Julie Finlay.
465,00:27:24,00:27:27,I work with the Las Vegas Police Department.
466,00:27:27,00:27:29,"Uh, I need to speak with your granddaughter, Amy."
467,00:27:31,00:27:32,It's about her dad.
468,00:27:35,00:27:36,What'd you get?
469,00:27:36,00:27:42,"So, Collin Winthrop had extensive HD surveillance at his house, all over the property."
470,00:27:42,00:27:46,"I mean, it's no surprise that cameras caught Paul Winthrop in his guesthouse, but..."
471,00:27:46,00:27:48,this is what I wanted you to see.
472,00:27:49,00:27:53,"RUSSELL: That's Collin Winthrop, right?"
473,00:27:53,00:27:55,Who's he arguing with?
474,00:27:55,00:27:57,"BRODY: Our friend, Brother Larson."
475,00:27:57,00:27:59,RUSSELL: That son of a bitch.
476,00:27:59,00:28:03,He told us that he had stopped having dealings with Winthrop Sr.
477,00:28:03,00:28:04,BRODY: Could be we've been wrong.
478,00:28:04,00:28:11,"Paul Winthrop had more than one coconspirator. It would help if we knew what they were talking about, but obviously, that's impossible."
479,00:28:11,00:28:13,This is gonna sound crazy...
480,00:28:13,00:28:16,but maybe the plants can help us.
481,00:28:16,00:28:25,"Thanks to the wealth of digital recordings that Winthrop has been leaving for us, Sara and I requisitioned every audio analysis program on the planet."
482,00:28:25,00:28:28,Including one that listens to plants?
483,00:28:28,00:28:36,"This one tracks minute vibrations of all sorts of different objects in a space, and analyzes the sounds that created them."
484,00:28:36,00:28:43,"Okay, I-I get that the sound of a voice can vibrate the leaves, but if you can't even see it, then how do you measure it?"
485,00:28:43,00:28:47,"Well, this is where the impossible becomes possible."
486,00:28:47,00:28:52,This software is able to detect motion less than one 100th of a pixel.
487,00:28:52,00:29:00,"By combining and filtering all that minute motion over the image, it can actually recover the sound of their voices."
488,00:29:00,00:29:03,I'm impressed.
489,00:29:03,00:29:05,I am tired of the blackmail.
490,00:29:05,00:29:06,I'm tired of the lies.
491,00:29:06,00:29:09,"I am not lying. I'm telling you, I don't know."
492,00:29:09,00:29:10,"Oh, you know. You've always known."
493,00:29:10,00:29:11,"Now, where is she?"
494,00:29:11,00:29:13,LARSON: That's not the reason I came here.
495,00:29:13,00:29:19,"No, you came here for money, as usual, and you're not gonna get another cent until you tell me where my daughter is!"
496,00:29:19,00:29:20,"I-I know, you think I'm gonna hurt her."
497,00:29:20,00:29:21,LARSON: Like you did before.
498,00:29:21,00:29:24,"Oh, that's all in the past. I'm talking about now."
499,00:29:24,00:29:27,I'm talking about Paul. He's figured it out.
500,00:29:27,00:29:29,He knows who May really is.
501,00:29:29,00:29:32,"And I need to protect her, 'cause if he finds her, he's gonna kill her."
502,00:29:32,00:29:38,"He'll never find her, and neither will-- LARSON: And you got all that from a plant?"
503,00:29:38,00:29:40,"Yeah, don't worry about it."
504,00:29:40,00:29:43,"You know, I agree with Winthrop."
505,00:29:43,00:29:46,I'm tired of all the lies.
506,00:29:46,00:29:51,"Based on that conversation, I did a little digging around the Winthrop family tree."
507,00:29:51,00:29:53,And it turns out that Collin Winthrop had a daughter.
508,00:29:53,00:29:55,May.
509,00:29:55,00:29:59,May went missing around age 15.
510,00:29:59,00:30:02,Police at the time determined that she was not kidnapped.
511,00:30:02,00:30:03,She just ran away.
512,00:30:03,00:30:09,"And, Brother Larson, I think you know where she ran to."
513,00:30:09,00:30:20,"Hmm. I do not. Look, I gave you a ""get out of jail free"" card last time because you helped me. If you do not come clean here, I promise you, it's gonna go the other way."
514,00:30:21,00:30:25,I guess confession is good for the soul.
515,00:30:25,00:30:28,(clears his throat)
516,00:30:28,00:30:31,I'm gonna tell you a little story.
517,00:30:31,00:30:33,Not a pretty one.
518,00:30:33,00:30:35,"About a young girl, 15."
519,00:30:35,00:30:38,Innocent... or so it seemed.
520,00:30:38,00:30:43,"Pregnant, she ran off to a convent."
521,00:30:43,00:30:47,"There she gave birth to twin boys, Paul and Jared."
522,00:30:47,00:30:49,But she didn't want them.
523,00:30:49,00:30:58,"More than that, though, she didn't want her father to lay claim to them, because... they were his blood."
524,00:30:58,00:31:03,You're-you're saying that Paul and Jared were the product of incest?
525,00:31:03,00:31:04,Yes.
526,00:31:04,00:31:09,"Now, May hid behind a name, Nancy Harper, just like she hid the boys."
527,00:31:09,00:31:13,"She found a home for Jared, but Paul was sickly."
528,00:31:13,00:31:19,"She tried to buy time by pretending he died, but Collin found Paul."
529,00:31:19,00:31:20,Raised him.
530,00:31:20,00:31:24,But he never found Jared... or May.
531,00:31:24,00:31:26,She vanished.
532,00:31:28,00:31:30,"You're pathetic, you know that?"
533,00:31:30,00:31:32,We ran your DNA.
534,00:31:32,00:31:35,It's a familial match to Paul Winthrop.
535,00:31:35,00:31:40,"So, you can forget your Chinatown story."
536,00:31:40,00:31:43,You are the father of Paul and Jared.
537,00:31:47,00:31:49,You want the truth?
538,00:31:49,00:31:52,A lie can be a powerful thing.
539,00:31:52,00:31:56,It can be used to deceive. It can be used to protect.
540,00:31:56,00:32:01,"I admit I deceived you, but I only did it to protect May."
541,00:32:01,00:32:03,I had nothing to do with these murders.
542,00:32:03,00:32:06,"Come on, Mr. Russell."
543,00:32:06,00:32:08,You know what this is all about?
544,00:32:08,00:32:16,"Paul Winthrop has been killing his mother over and over, getting ready for his End of Days."
545,00:32:16,00:32:21,"And with Jared gone, that time has come."
546,00:32:21,00:32:23,Paul will find May.
547,00:32:23,00:32:25,He will render judgment.
548,00:32:25,00:32:27,Unless you protect her.
549,00:32:27,00:32:30,"As, apparently, I no longer can."
550,00:32:30,00:32:32,Okay.
551,00:32:32,00:32:36,"If I'm gonna protect May, I need to know where she is."
552,00:32:36,00:32:38,You already do.
553,00:32:38,00:32:42,"The convent she ran off to, she never left it."
554,00:32:42,00:32:45,Your CSI Finlay-- she's met May.
555,00:32:46,00:32:49,Or should I say...
556,00:32:49,00:32:51,Sister Alice.
557,00:32:51,00:32:54,"Every time I talk to that guy, I feel like I need a shower."
558,00:32:54,00:32:57,I don't even know why I bother to believe him anymore.
559,00:32:57,00:33:03,I keep thinking about what Winthrop said to you on the digital recorder-- that so many have paid for the injustice done to him and Jared.
560,00:33:03,00:33:08,"""And yet, those who are truly responsible have escaped his wrath until now."" Think about it."
561,00:33:08,00:33:10,"He killed Collin Winthrop, he tried to kill Finn."
562,00:33:10,00:33:13,"At some point, he's probably gonna come after you."
563,00:33:13,00:33:18,"Yeah, but top of his list has to be his mother who abandoned him and his brother, right?"
564,00:33:18,00:33:19,Not only abandoned them.
565,00:33:19,00:33:22,"Separated them, cast them adrift."
566,00:33:22,00:33:24,"Yeah, you know what?"
567,00:33:24,00:33:27,She's the way we're gonna catch this guy.
568,00:33:27,00:33:31,"Okay, okay, so, Finn and I will go up to Seattle."
569,00:33:31,00:33:35,We'll put this Sister Alice into protective custody.
570,00:33:35,00:33:37,Use her as bait. Right.
571,00:33:37,00:33:39,Do me a favor. Call Seattle PD.
572,00:33:39,00:33:41,Let's get eyes on the convent.
573,00:33:41,00:33:44,I'll pick up Finn on the way to the airport.
574,00:33:50,00:33:53,"Jules, it's me."
575,00:33:54,00:33:57,"Hey, Jules, come on, open up."
576,00:34:06,00:34:09,(door creaks open)
577,00:34:13,00:34:15,(screaming)
578,00:34:20,00:34:22,"WINTHROP: Hello, Mr. Russell."
579,00:34:24,00:34:27,Jared and I have been waiting for you.
580,00:34:36,00:34:37,What have you done?
581,00:34:37,00:34:39,Isn't it obvious? She's dead.
582,00:34:41,00:34:44,"Easy! Easy, now."
583,00:34:44,00:34:45,Let's not rush this.
584,00:34:45,00:34:49,"Yeah, copy that, Nick. As soon as you wrap things up in San Diego, I need you back here."
585,00:34:49,00:34:51,Russell and Finn are on their way to Seattle.
586,00:34:51,00:34:53,"All right. Yeah, call me when you're on the road."
587,00:34:53,00:34:54,Hey. Seattle PD called back.
588,00:34:54,00:34:55,They went to the convent.
589,00:34:55,00:34:56,No sign of Sister Alice.
590,00:34:56,00:34:58,Nuns have no idea where she is.
591,00:34:58,00:34:59,Did you tell Russell?
592,00:34:59,00:35:03,I tried calling him and Finn. I can't get a hold of either of them. Do you know where they are?
593,00:35:03,00:35:05,"They're supposed to be on their way up north, but I got a bad feeling."
594,00:35:05,00:35:08,"Listen, find Greg, then meet me at Finn's condo."
595,00:35:08,00:35:10,Okay.
596,00:35:10,00:35:12,(groaning)
597,00:35:12,00:35:15,Aah! You sick bastard!
598,00:35:15,00:35:17,How does it feel...
599,00:35:17,00:35:20,"to lose someone you love, to have your heart ripped away from you?"
600,00:35:20,00:35:22,"Oh, I know what you're thinking."
601,00:35:22,00:35:24,Was it quick? Did she suffer?
602,00:35:24,00:35:26,Did she scream? You're the expert.
603,00:35:26,00:35:27,What does the crime scene tell you?
604,00:35:29,00:35:32,Look at it.
605,00:35:46,00:35:49,I want you to know she suffered.
606,00:35:49,00:35:51,She begged for me to end it.
607,00:35:53,00:35:55,I don't believe you.
608,00:35:55,00:35:59,You wanted me to take a look at your crime scene?
609,00:35:59,00:36:00,The blood gives you away.
610,00:36:00,00:36:04,"That's hardly a lethal loss of blood, wouldn't you say?"
611,00:36:04,00:36:06,And where's the spatter?
612,00:36:06,00:36:09,"Come on, where's the spatter? You haven't even put up all your strings."
613,00:36:09,00:36:11,You weren't waiting for me.
614,00:36:11,00:36:13,I interrupted you before you were finished.
615,00:36:13,00:36:14,Where's Finlay?
616,00:36:14,00:36:15,Where is she?
617,00:36:22,00:36:23,What do you got?
618,00:36:23,00:36:25,Russell and Finlay's vehicles are here.
619,00:36:25,00:36:26,They're still not answering.
620,00:36:26,00:36:28,I'll have my men secure the building.
621,00:36:28,00:36:29,Then we'll move in tactically.
622,00:36:29,00:36:30,Let's do it.
623,00:36:30,00:36:31,WINTHROP: Finlay is dead.
624,00:36:31,00:36:35,I told you. She's already buried in the desert where you will never find her.
625,00:36:35,00:36:36,You're gonna tell me where she is.
626,00:36:36,00:36:39,I don't really think you're in a position to negotiate here.
627,00:36:39,00:36:41,"You've been looking for your mom, haven't you?"
628,00:36:41,00:36:44,"I know who she is, Paul, and I know where she is."
629,00:36:44,00:36:47,You're lying. Even my father didn't know that.
630,00:36:47,00:36:49,That's 'cause your father's not Collin Winthrop.
631,00:36:49,00:36:56,Your father was a pimp who got a 15-year-old girl pregnant with bastard twins.
632,00:36:56,00:36:56,You and your brother.
633,00:36:56,00:36:58,I should kill you now.
634,00:36:58,00:37:01,"You do that, and you'll never know."
635,00:37:01,00:37:03,Where is she? Where's my mother?!
636,00:37:03,00:37:05,You tell me where Finlay is.
637,00:37:05,00:37:07,I'll tell you where your mother is.
638,00:37:07,00:37:10,"What's it gonna be, Paul?"
639,00:37:11,00:37:13,No!
640,00:37:13,00:37:16,(Winthrop gasps) He knows where Finlay is.
641,00:37:17,00:37:19,Where is she? Where is Finlay?
642,00:37:19,00:37:20,You'll never find her in time.
643,00:37:20,00:37:22,She's still alive. She's got to be close.
644,00:37:22,00:37:24,He said he was gonna take her to the desert.
645,00:37:24,00:37:26,He has to get her there somehow.
646,00:37:26,00:37:27,"Greg, Morgan, where are you?"
647,00:37:27,00:37:29,We just rolled up. In the garage.
648,00:37:29,00:37:30,SIDLE: We need to find Winthrop's vehicle.
649,00:37:30,00:37:32,We believe it's on the premises. Start canvassing.
650,00:37:32,00:37:34,Start running plates.
651,00:37:34,00:37:35,SANDERS: Copy that.
652,00:37:35,00:37:36,Where is she?
653,00:37:36,00:37:39,Can you hear me? Where is she?!
654,00:37:39,00:37:41,"MAN: All right, that vehicle's a negative. Next one."
655,00:37:41,00:37:45,"BRODY: Vehicle is a black Lincoln Continental, Nevada plates."
656,00:37:45,00:37:47,Plate number HRGK-698.
657,00:37:47,00:37:51,That car was reported stolen from the California-Nevada state line.
658,00:37:51,00:37:54,"Greg, take a look at this."
659,00:37:54,00:37:57,This car was stolen this morning from the California state line.
660,00:38:02,00:38:03,"Oh, my God."
661,00:38:03,00:38:06,It's Finn.
662,00:38:06,00:38:08,"Come on, Finn. Come on."
663,00:38:10,00:38:13,"I can't find a pulse, but she's still warm."
664,00:38:15,00:38:16,Call medevac. Yeah.
665,00:38:16,00:38:22,"This is CSI Morgan Brody, requesting medevac assistance at my location."
666,00:38:58,00:38:59,(sighs)
667,00:39:00,00:39:02,D.B.
668,00:39:02,00:39:03,Hey.
669,00:39:03,00:39:05,How you doing?
670,00:39:05,00:39:09,One day at time. Isn't that what they say?
671,00:39:09,00:39:14,"So, I was just up at the hospital, and the nurse there told me you've been going up there every weekend."
672,00:39:14,00:39:16,"Yeah, she's just not responsive."
673,00:39:16,00:39:23,"I mean, her body's healing, but they just can't say when she's gonna regain consciousness."
674,00:39:24,00:39:27,Or if she will.
675,00:39:27,00:39:32,"Well, one thing we do know is that Winthrop is gonna recover, and when he does, he's gonna pay for what he's done."
676,00:39:32,00:39:34,Right? Yeah.
677,00:39:36,00:39:39,Did Lab Director Nolan call you about that job?
678,00:39:39,00:39:40,Oh. I'm so sorry.
679,00:39:40,00:39:42,"Yeah, he did. He did, yeah."
680,00:39:42,00:39:44,Congratulations. I hear you're gonna take it.
681,00:39:44,00:39:48,"I was. I think I'm gonna call him back, tell him to hold off on that for a little bit."
682,00:39:48,00:39:51,"No, no, no, no. Come on, sit-sit down."
683,00:39:51,00:39:52,Just give me... give me one second.
684,00:39:52,00:39:56,Now... why would you do that?
685,00:39:56,00:39:58,It's just not the right time.
686,00:39:58,00:40:01,"Not right now, not with what's going on with Julie."
687,00:40:01,00:40:03,(sighs)
688,00:40:03,00:40:07,Whatever happens with Jules-- there's nothing you and I can do about that.
689,00:40:08,00:40:16,"But if she was sitting in that chair right now, she would tell you to get your ass on that plane to San Diego, and you know it."
690,00:40:18,00:40:21,"You need to do this, bud."
691,00:40:34,00:40:36,"You're not trying to sneak out of here, are you?"
692,00:40:36,00:40:37,(laughs)
693,00:40:37,00:40:40,"No, I wouldn't do something like that to you."
694,00:40:40,00:40:41,SANDERS: Wow.
695,00:40:41,00:40:43,This is really happening.
696,00:40:45,00:40:47,I respect and love you both.
697,00:40:48,00:40:50,I'll miss you.
698,00:40:50,00:40:52,You better stay safe out there.
699,00:40:53,00:40:54,I will.
700,00:40:54,00:40:57,We're really happy for you.
701,00:40:57,00:40:59,Lab Director Nick Stokes.
702,00:40:59,00:41:01,"SIDLE: Has a nice ring, doesn't it?"
703,00:41:01,00:41:02,SANDERS: Yeah.
704,00:41:02,00:41:04,"We're still on for drinks at McCarthy's, right?"
705,00:41:04,00:41:06,Yeah. First round's on me. (Sanders laughs)
706,00:41:06,00:41:09,"The raise I hear you're getting, I think they should all be on you."
707,00:41:09,00:41:10,"Oh, yeah, that's fair enough, fair enough."
708,00:41:11,00:41:15,"Yeah, well, see you then, hmm?"
709,00:41:15,00:41:16,See you later.
