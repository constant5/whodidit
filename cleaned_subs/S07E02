0	00:01:17	00:01:20	Yeah, that's my real photo on my profile.
1	00:01:21	00:01:23	Excuse me.
2	00:01:23	00:01:26	Well, I exercise a lot.
3	00:01:26	00:01:28	Kind of an animal about it.
4	00:01:32	00:01:34	Hey.
5	00:01:34	00:01:35	Did you see me last night?
6	00:01:35	00:01:37	Yeah, you were feeling no pain.
7	00:01:39	00:01:41	Who was I with?
8	00:01:41	00:01:42	Describe him.
9	00:01:42	00:01:45	Was he white, black, tall?
10	00:01:45	00:01:48	Hair color, car?
11	00:01:48	00:01:50	Look, lady, I get paid not to notice.
12	00:01:53	00:01:55	Who was room 229 registered to?
13	00:02:00	00:02:02	Catherine Willows.
14	00:02:02	00:02:05	You used your credit card.
15	00:02:17	00:02:20	I think Malibu Barbie did it.
16	00:02:20	00:02:28	Well, then there's a lot more to Barbie than just a pretty face, 'cause this is a perfect half-inch scale model of the the room.
17	00:02:28	00:02:31	And assuming that the killer is the same person who made the miniature...
18	00:02:31	00:02:32	It would of taken weeks.
19	00:02:33	00:02:37	Maybe even months to create with this kind of detail.
20	00:02:37	00:02:39	Certainly qualifies as premeditation.
21	00:02:39	00:02:42	Yeah, but take a look at he blood pools.
22	00:02:42	00:02:44	They're identical.
23	00:02:44	00:02:48	There's no predicting a blood pool, it's inherently random.
24	00:02:48	00:02:51	Killer must of stuck around to match the scene.
25	00:03:01	00:03:03	It's real blood.
26	00:03:08	00:03:12	That is a level of obsession that gives even you a run for your money.
27	00:03:15	00:03:19	If Dusty Fell, Izzy Delancy.
28	00:03:19	00:03:22	I have never heard of him.
29	00:03:22	00:03:23	Probably before your time.
30	00:03:23	00:03:25	I'll download it.
31	00:03:25	00:03:29	I checked the perimeter, property is gated with a code.
32	00:03:29	00:03:33	There is no sign of forced entry on the windows or the doors.
33	00:03:33	00:03:39	Of course if a girl can get into Brad Pitt's underwear drawer, and take a nap on his bed, I guess anything is possible.
34	00:03:41	00:03:45	Lividity suggests he hasn't been moved.
35	00:03:45	00:03:48	He was probably sitting right here when he was killed.
36	00:03:51	00:03:54	Looks like blunt force trauma.
37	00:03:56	00:03:58	No spatter or cast off.
38	00:04:02	00:04:05	Sometimes it only takes one hit.
39	00:04:51	00:04:53	Oh, great, you're here, thanks for coming.
40	00:04:53	00:04:56	I can't believe you're leaving Izzy Delancy's death scene.
41	00:04:56	00:04:57	Groupies are already starting to gather.
42	00:04:57	00:04:59	I have something that I have to take care of.
43	00:04:59	00:05:03	Nick and Sofia are talking with the family, Grissom's in the kitchen, you can process the bedrooms?
44	00:05:03	00:05:05	Thanks.
45	00:05:15	00:05:17	Mrs. Delancy?
46	00:05:19	00:05:22	No, that's Mrs. Delancy.
47	00:05:24	00:05:26	I'm Annie, the nanny.
48	00:05:28	00:05:30	I'm going to need to photograph your hands.
49	00:05:30	00:05:31	To look for blood, right?
50	00:05:31	00:05:35	Blood evidence, yeah, and defensive wounds.
51	00:05:35	00:05:39	I'm also going to get a sample of your DNA and your fingerprints.
52	00:05:39	00:05:43	So, why don't you hand little Nora to her mom for right now, okay?
53	00:05:43	00:05:47	No, Mrs. D never holds the baby.
54	00:05:47	00:05:48	She's got a bad back.
55	00:05:56	00:05:58	I should warn you, I'm a little freaked.
56	00:05:58	00:06:01	When I get nervous or scared or whatever I have this problem where I talk a lot.
57	00:06:01	00:06:03	I've had it since I was little I just keep talking...
58	00:06:03	00:06:05	You found the body?
59	00:06:10	00:06:12	Tuesday is Chinese.
60	00:06:12	00:06:14	Izzy insists...
61	00:06:14	00:06:15	on having...
62	00:06:15	00:06:17	a really strict eating schedule.
63	00:06:18	00:06:21	00 and when I went into the kitchen...
64	00:06:24	00:06:26	Baby's don't eat bok choy.
65	00:06:26	00:06:36	Yeah, I wonder what you're going to have for-- I immediately called 9-1-1.
66	00:06:36	00:06:40	Speaking of which, can I get a copy of the police report?
67	00:06:42	00:06:45	Why don't you... Where is your shirt?
68	00:06:48	00:06:52	Right after it all went down the baby spit up on it and I put it in the laundry. Mmm.
69	00:06:52	00:06:54	It happens all the time.
70	00:06:54	00:06:55	Nobody minds.
71	00:07:30	00:07:32	Hey, what's going on?
72	00:07:32	00:07:34	I may have been roofied and raped.
73	00:07:35	00:07:36	I woke up here.
74	00:07:36	00:07:37	What?
75	00:07:37	00:07:39	I, uh, improvised my own a rape kit.
76	00:07:39	00:07:45	I've got pubic combing, nail scrapings, vaginal swab, urine samples... Whoa, whoa, whoa, did you call it in?
77	00:07:45	00:07:46	I called you.
78	00:07:46	00:07:51	Catherine, doing it yourself is going to make anything that you get inadmissible.
79	00:07:51	00:07:54	Yeah, I know procedure, I didn't want an official investigation.
80	00:07:54	00:07:55	I-I just want to know what happened.
81	00:07:55	00:07:57	Okay, all right.
82	00:07:57	00:08:00	Uh...
83	00:08:00	00:08:02	I got to get this, uh, stuff to the lab.
84	00:08:02	00:08:04	Room 229, it's right up there.
85	00:08:04	00:08:05	Please print it.
86	00:08:05	00:08:09	And keep it between us.
87	00:08:09	00:08:10	Okay.
88	00:08:10	00:08:11	Thanks.
89	00:08:19	00:08:21	I went out for a latte.
90	00:08:21	00:08:22	00.
91	00:08:22	00:08:25	I never even went into the kitchen.
92	00:08:26	00:08:28	I just went straight upstairs and took a shower.
93	00:08:30	00:08:33	God that means that he was dead this whole time.
94	00:08:33	00:08:38	We believe whoever killed your husband had access to the house.
95	00:08:38	00:08:41	Yeah, do you think anyone else had the... the gate code?
96	00:08:41	00:08:44	Just the housekeepers.
97	00:08:44	00:08:47	And the handymen, and the pool guys.
98	00:08:47	00:08:49	And the gardeners, and the...
99	00:08:49	00:08:51	messengers and...
100	00:08:51	00:08:52	the caterers.
101	00:09:14	00:09:18	I can tell you where you should start looking.
102	00:09:19	00:09:21	Sven.
103	00:09:24	00:09:26	Are you accusing your son of killing your husband?
104	00:09:31	00:09:32	He is not my son.
105	00:09:32	00:09:35	That's Izzy's kid from his first wife.
106	00:09:36	00:09:37	Oh.
107	00:09:37	00:09:38	He has real problems.
108	00:09:38	00:09:41	His mom was like a cokehead or something.
109	00:10:06	00:10:08	Hey, how you doing?
110	00:10:11	00:10:13	How you doing man?
111	00:10:13	00:10:16	I've been better.
112	00:10:16	00:10:18	What time did you get back from school?
113	00:10:18	00:10:20	00.
114	00:10:20	00:10:22	And then what did you do?
115	00:10:22	00:10:25	Homework, games.
116	00:10:25	00:10:26	Did you...
117	00:10:26	00:10:28	see your dad at all?
118	00:10:28	00:10:33	No, I usually don't see him until dinner.
119	00:10:33	00:10:35	And then...
120	00:10:35	00:10:37	I get picked up right after, so.
121	00:10:37	00:10:38	By who?
122	00:10:40	00:10:41	My mom.
123	00:10:41	00:10:44	You don't live here full time?
124	00:10:44	00:10:46	Tuesdays and every other Saturday.
125	00:10:50	00:10:52	Well, that's got to be tough.
126	00:10:52	00:10:55	Whatever.
127	00:10:55	00:10:59	I just go where I'm told.
128	00:10:59	00:11:01	Let me in, I am his mother.
129	00:11:01	00:11:05	I know, baby, I know.
130	00:11:05	00:11:06	This is really hard.
131	00:11:06	00:11:09	It's okay to be upset, okay.
132	00:11:12	00:11:13	What's on your finger...
133	00:11:13	00:11:17	Did you fingerprint my son?
134	00:11:17	00:11:19	We fingerprinted everyone in the house, DNA samples as well.
135	00:11:19	00:11:21	Is he a suspect?
136	00:11:21	00:11:23	He didn't refuse and Mrs. Delancy was here.
137	00:11:23	00:11:27	Sleeping with his father does not make her his mother, okay.
138	00:11:27	00:11:28	I'm his mother.
139	00:11:28	00:11:29	Where were you this afternoon?
140	00:11:29	00:11:31	I was taking a walk.
141	00:11:31	00:11:33	Can anyone confirm that?
142	00:11:33	00:11:35	No.
143	00:11:35	00:11:36	Come on.
144	00:11:36	00:11:38	Let's go.
145	00:13:12	00:13:17	Bleach was used in this kitchen but not to clean up the blood.
146	00:13:17	00:13:24	So the aging rocker bit it in the kitchen with the marble rolling pin?
147	00:13:37	00:13:41	If only the who was as easy as the how.
148	00:14:22	00:14:25	Oh, hey. You got to be pulling a double if you're in my lab at this hour.
149	00:14:26	00:14:27	Yeah.
150	00:14:27	00:14:28	What's up? You need a hand?
151	00:14:28	00:14:30	No. Thanks.
152	00:14:31	00:14:34	Oh. ABA card.
153	00:14:35	00:14:36	It's negative for semen.
154	00:14:36	00:14:38	I said I didn't need your help.
155	00:14:45	00:14:49	Oh, thank you, but there's no drinking or eating allowed in the lab.
156	00:14:49	00:14:50	It's a urine sample.
157	00:14:50	00:14:51	My bad.
158	00:14:52	00:14:53	Get it to Tox.
159	00:14:53	00:14:56	And... check this for spermicide.
160	00:14:56	00:14:59	Call me with the results.
161	00:14:59	00:15:01	Did you run out of proper swabs?
162	00:15:01	00:15:02	Just do it.
163	00:15:02	00:15:04	What's the case number?
164	00:15:04	00:15:06	Consider this a proficiency exam.
165	00:15:09	00:15:10	Muggs?
166	00:15:10	00:15:14	Sam. What are you doing here?
167	00:15:14	00:15:17	Just wanted to see your face, and I missed you at the implosion party.
168	00:15:17	00:15:19	Oh, yeah.
169	00:15:19	00:15:20	I heard about that, um...
170	00:15:20	00:15:22	I'm sorry I missed that.
171	00:15:22	00:15:24	When's Lily get back from her cruise?
172	00:15:24	00:15:26	Monday.
173	00:15:26	00:15:28	How about a family dinner?
174	00:15:28	00:15:31	Uh, yeah, I'll call you when she's had a chance to catch her breath.
175	00:15:31	00:15:34	You know you don't always need a reason to call me.
176	00:15:34	00:15:35	I know you're busy.
177	00:15:35	00:15:37	I'll see you later.
178	00:16:10	00:16:12	Cause of death?
179	00:16:30	00:16:31	Sorry, Izzy.
180	00:16:34	00:16:37	Now... what is that?
181	00:16:50	00:16:51	The key to our mystery?
182	00:17:49	00:17:51	Excuse me.
183	00:17:51	00:17:53	What can I do you for?
184	00:17:53	00:17:54	You were working last night.
185	00:17:54	00:17:56	Always. I own the place.
186	00:17:56	00:17:57	Do you remember me?
187	00:17:57	00:18:00	I was... I was here.
188	00:18:00	00:18:02	Was a busy night, I'm sorry.
189	00:18:05	00:18:08	Well... do you have any surveillance cameras in the place?
190	00:18:08	00:18:10	What's this about?
191	00:18:13	00:18:15	I'm with the Crime Lab.
192	00:18:16	00:18:18	Yeah, that's the only one.
193	00:18:18	00:18:21	Just gets the cash register.
194	00:18:21	00:18:25	So you've got nothing that covers the customers or the dance floor, or...?
195	00:18:25	00:18:26	No need to.
196	00:19:08	00:19:11	Find something?
197	00:19:11	00:19:12	No.
198	00:19:12	00:19:15	No prints, no hairs, no fibers.
199	00:19:15	00:19:22	Materials are common hobby shop issue, but the blood matches the victim's.
200	00:19:22	00:19:24	Are you interested in motive?
201	00:19:24	00:19:30	Sofia just spent the last two hours with the sheriff, the head of the Olympia Casino, and a couple of dozen lawyers.
202	00:19:30	00:19:34	Apparently, Izzy Delancy owned the rights to his own songs.
203	00:19:34	00:19:38	The Olympia was negotiating to purchase them for a medley show based on his music.
204	00:19:38	00:19:40	Izzy never got a chance to sign the contracts.
205	00:19:40	00:19:47	Dead rock star, nut job family, and a company hungry for the next Mamma Mia!
206	00:19:47	00:19:48	Who inherits the music rights?
207	00:19:49	00:19:54	The son, Sven, but he's a minor, so the rights would be controlled by his mother, Dusty.
208	00:19:54	00:19:56	It's illegal to benefit from a criminal act.
209	00:19:56	00:19:59	If either one of them committed the murder...
210	00:19:59	00:20:02	Then the rights would go to Izzy's current wife, Madeline.
211	00:20:02	00:20:05	Well, that's motive for her.
212	00:20:05	00:20:07	But how does this fit in?
213	00:20:07	00:20:10	Maybe we should release it to the media.
214	00:20:11	00:20:13	Someone might have unwittingly made a component of the miniature.
215	00:20:13	00:20:17	If they came forward, that could help us.
216	00:20:17	00:20:19	What's the point of gratifying the murderer with publicity?
217	00:20:19	00:20:22	Izzy Delancy is famous; the press wants answers.
218	00:20:22	00:20:24	Don't we all?
219	00:20:24	00:20:26	Sara, this is your case, too-- what do you think?
220	00:20:26	00:20:30	I, uh... I agree with Grissom.
221	00:20:31	00:20:33	Of course you do.
222	00:20:40	00:20:42	I looked into the key that Izzy swallowed.
223	00:20:42	00:20:43	Turns out that Bumblebee is a safe company.
224	00:20:43	00:20:45	Sofia asked Madeline about it.
225	00:20:45	00:20:49	She says she knew that there was a safe in the house but didn't know where it was-- my kind of marriage.
226	00:20:49	00:20:53	So the key could've been in his system anywhere from a few minutes to several days?
227	00:20:53	00:21:03	Right. So if robbery was the motive for murder and Izzy swallowed the key to keep something hidden, maybe whatever is in that safe will lead us to who.
228	00:23:01	00:23:03	You're late.
229	00:23:03	00:23:05	I did the best I could, Lindsey.
230	00:23:05	00:23:06	You said you would watch the rehearsal.
231	00:23:06	00:23:09	Work just... really got out of hand.
232	00:23:09	00:23:12	Surprise.
233	00:23:23	00:23:24	Lindsey.
234	00:23:25	00:23:26	I really am sorry.
235	00:23:26	00:23:28	I hate it when work gets in the way.
236	00:23:28	00:23:30	I love to watch you dance.
237	00:23:32	00:23:34	Fine. Whatever.
238	00:23:37	00:23:39	I got a solo.
239	00:23:39	00:23:41	You did?
240	00:23:41	00:23:42	That's so great!
241	00:23:42	00:23:43	It's Romeo and Juliet.
242	00:23:43	00:23:44	Fanta...
243	00:23:57	00:24:00	Is my daughter okay?
244	00:24:03	00:24:06	Lindsey!
245	00:24:06	00:24:08	Lindsey!
246	00:24:10	00:24:11	Lindsey...!
247	00:24:20	00:24:21	I don't need that. I'm fine.
248	00:24:21	00:24:23	Ma'am, you need to put this on, for your own safety.
249	00:24:23	00:24:24	You suffered a head trauma.
250	00:24:24	00:24:26	There could be serious delayed problems.
251	00:24:26	00:24:28	I'm refusing treatment. Just give me the release form.
252	00:24:28	00:24:29	Ma'am, I strongly recommend you put this on...
253	00:24:29	00:24:31	Just give me the damn form! Hey, hey, hey.
254	00:24:31	00:24:32	Catherine. They got Lindsey.
255	00:24:32	00:24:33	I know. They took Lindsey.
256	00:24:34	00:24:35	It's all over the radio, I heard. It was an SUV.
257	00:24:36	00:24:38	And it was silver or brown. We're gonna get Lindsey back, okay?
258	00:24:38	00:24:40	And they drove that direction.
259	00:24:40	00:24:41	I never saw it coming. Okay.
260	00:24:41	00:24:42	They came from this direction.
261	00:24:42	00:24:44	Slow down, slow down.
262	00:24:52	00:24:55	These are acceleration marks.
263	00:24:55	00:24:56	They were waiting for us.
264	00:24:58	00:25:00	I should've told you, but I didn't want a sermon.
265	00:25:00	00:25:02	I did my own rape kit.
266	00:25:02	00:25:03	Came back negative.
267	00:25:03	00:25:05	Thank God.
268	00:25:05	00:25:06	These events have to be connected.
269	00:25:07	00:25:10	We'll check your old cases for possible suspects.
270	00:25:10	00:25:12	I'll ask Ecklie if he can kick in some help from day shift.
271	00:25:12	00:25:14	I appreciate that.
272	00:25:14	00:25:16	You've got to stay at arm's length, Catherine.
273	00:25:16	00:25:18	I-I know.
274	00:25:26	00:25:28	Nothing but partials.
275	00:25:28	00:25:30	That's impossible.
276	00:25:30	00:25:32	I ran the VIN number on the Cougar that hit you.
277	00:25:32	00:25:36	A place sold it yesterday for cash.
278	00:25:36	00:25:38	Catherine, I'm really sorry for leaving you there.
279	00:25:38	00:25:39	Don't go there, Nick.
280	00:25:39	00:25:41	They were gonna get to me, one way or another.
281	00:25:41	00:25:47	It had to have been at least two guys-- one who was driving the Cougar, and the other in the SUV.
282	00:25:51	00:25:54	He reached through the window.
283	00:25:54	00:25:55	Print the inside of that handle.
284	00:25:55	00:25:58	Okay.
285	00:25:58	00:26:00	Sam?
286	00:26:02	00:26:04	It just happened. Who told you?
287	00:26:06	00:26:07	Well, I can't talk right now.
288	00:26:07	00:26:09	I'll let you know when we find something out.
289	00:26:16	00:26:18	Sure, Sam.
290	00:26:25	00:26:26	Sam!
291	00:26:28	00:26:31	What do you know about what happened to Lindsey?
292	00:26:31	00:26:32	What do you know about it?
293	00:26:32	00:26:34	Who's using us to get to you?
294	00:26:34	00:26:36	This is your granddaughter we're talking about.
295	00:26:36	00:26:37	What the hell do you know?
296	00:26:43	00:26:46	Front desk found this in the quick checkout bin.
297	00:26:49	00:26:50	Can you guess what you're going to give me?
298	00:26:50	00:26:52	What does that mean? Who's behind this?
299	00:26:52	00:26:54	I don't know.
300	00:26:54	00:26:56	This was just found.
301	00:26:56	00:26:58	Same place.
302	00:27:04	00:27:05	Where is she?
303	00:27:05	00:27:07	Who has her?
304	00:27:07	00:27:09	I swear, I don't know.
305	00:27:09	00:27:10	Like hell!
306	00:27:10	00:27:13	I blame you! I blame you for this!
307	00:27:13	00:27:16	I never wanted to involve you personally or professionally in any of my business.
308	00:27:16	00:27:18	Business? You don't have a business.
309	00:27:18	00:27:20	You're a thug in thousand dollar shoes!
310	00:27:28	00:27:32	Thanks for not disappointing me, Sam.
311	00:27:43	00:27:48	Okay, but could you take a break or get a cup of tea or something here?
312	00:27:48	00:27:49	Think I got something. What?
313	00:27:49	00:27:56	Mandy ran the print that I picked up from your car, and it's a match to an open burglary case, from a few months ago.
314	00:27:56	00:27:57	I think it was yours, Warrick.
315	00:27:58	00:28:00	I got it.
316	00:28:00	00:28:04	Oh, this is from this couple from San Francisco.
317	00:28:04	00:28:09	Bought a second home in Seven Hills, came back and found it tossed.
318	00:28:12	00:28:13	The chair.
319	00:28:16	00:28:18	Look at that.
320	00:28:18	00:28:19	The chair.
321	00:28:24	00:28:26	Las Vegas police you're under arrest.
322	00:28:30	00:28:31	Gun! Gun!
323	00:28:40	00:28:40	Call a paramedic!
324	00:28:40	00:28:42	Lindsey!
325	00:28:42	00:28:43	Lindsey! Mom!
326	00:28:43	00:28:45	Where are you, Lindsey?! (muffled screaming)
327	00:28:45	00:28:48	Lindsey! Lindsey!
328	00:28:48	00:28:49	Lindsey! Catherine!
329	00:28:50	00:28:51	Don't touch her.
330	00:28:51	00:28:54	If you want a conviction, you have to let me do this, all right?
331	00:28:54	00:28:57	Let me do it, all right?
332	00:28:57	00:28:58	All right.
333	00:28:58	00:28:59	I'm right here, Lindsey.
334	00:28:59	00:29:01	Right here.
335	00:29:01	00:29:02	I'm right here.
336	00:29:05	00:29:06	I'm right here.
337	00:29:06	00:29:08	I'm right here. I'm right here.
338	00:29:13	00:29:14	Deep breaths.
339	00:29:16	00:29:17	Breathe easy.
340	00:29:17	00:29:19	Deep breaths.
341	00:29:19	00:29:22	Almost. Almost.
342	00:29:22	00:29:24	Okay. It's okay.
343	00:29:24	00:29:25	I got you.
344	00:29:25	00:29:27	I got you. Everything's okay.
345	00:29:27	00:29:29	Mom.
346	00:29:29	00:29:30	It's okay.
347	00:29:30	00:29:32	It's okay, baby.
348	00:29:32	00:29:33	It's okay.
349	00:29:33	00:29:34	Everything's okay.
350	00:29:36	00:29:38	Mom.
351	00:29:39	00:29:40	I got you.
352	00:29:40	00:29:42	Everything's okay.
353	00:29:42	00:29:43	It's okay.
354	00:29:59	00:30:00	How's Lindsey?
355	00:30:02	00:30:04	She says she's fine.
356	00:30:04	00:30:07	The doctor is assessing her now.
357	00:30:07	00:30:10	We still don't have an ID.
358	00:30:12	00:30:13	Prints put him in the motel.
359	00:30:19	00:30:22	Can you place him at the bar?
360	00:30:31	00:30:33	Yeah.
361	00:30:33	00:30:34	Yeah, he was there.
362	00:30:34	00:30:36	The accident was a two-man job.
363	00:30:36	00:30:37	Can you remember anybody else?
364	00:30:49	00:30:52	I can't get a face.
365	00:30:53	00:30:55	Greg found the mother lode.
366	00:30:55	00:30:57	The Nanny saved all of her e-mails on her computer.
367	00:30:57	00:31:03	She was sending private Delancy family photos to an editor at Scandal Pages magazine.
368	00:31:03	00:31:10	Based on a sliding scale of salaciousness, Scandal Pages was depositing money into Annie's PayPal account.
369	00:31:10	00:31:15	So I have the DNA combo from Sven's bed sheets, and none of it was actually Sven's.
370	00:31:22	00:31:24	Whoa.
371	00:31:28	00:31:34	Annie Lansfield, Cornstalk Queen of Tidioute, Pennsylvania.
372	00:31:34	00:31:44	You move to Vegas to become famous and ended up doing diaper duty for a washed-up rock star.
373	00:31:44	00:31:48	Do you want to tell me how you ended up in a safe that even his wife didn't know about?
374	00:31:48	00:31:51	I clean for extra cash.
375	00:31:51	00:31:52	I know the house better than anyone.
376	00:31:53	00:31:54	I knew where the safe was.
377	00:31:54	00:31:57	I just didn't have a key, until...
378	00:31:57	00:32:01	Honey, I need some money to buy clothes for Emma.
379	00:32:01	00:32:03	I just gave you money for that.
380	00:32:03	00:32:04	She's a baby.
381	00:32:04	00:32:05	She grows.
382	00:32:05	00:32:09	You know, this wouldn't even be an issue if you would sign those damn contracts.
383	00:32:09	00:32:10	Really?
384	00:32:10	00:32:12	Well, that is between me and my music.
385	00:32:12	00:32:16	And you, you will never see this safe.
386	00:32:23	00:32:24	Gold digger!
387	00:32:24	00:32:25	Dig for that!
388	00:32:27	00:32:30	The E.R. doctor said it would pass in a couple of days.
389	00:32:30	00:32:34	They gave us a copy of the X-ray to keep on file with the general physician.
390	00:32:34	00:32:37	It had the perfect outline of the key.
391	00:32:37	00:32:40	So, I took the X-ray to a key shop, told them my kid swallowed it.
392	00:32:40	00:32:42	Resourceful.
393	00:32:42	00:32:43	But I put everything back.
394	00:32:43	00:32:47	After making Scandal Pages money off it.
395	00:32:47	00:32:51	Look, a few years ago, Izzy went on this big health kick-- vegetarian, blah, blah.
396	00:32:51	00:32:56	He claimed that all those chicken heads that he bit on stage were fake.
397	00:32:56	00:32:58	When I found them, I was just so excited.
398	00:32:59	00:33:02	Do you know how much Scandal Pages pays for an urban legend story?
399	00:33:02	00:33:03	A lot.
400	00:33:05	00:33:10	we got evidence of sex between you and Izzy Delancy in Sven's bed.
401	00:33:10	00:33:17	if you killed him, you'd be the first to crack open that whole story.
402	00:33:17	00:33:20	Exclusive pics, the whole deal.
403	00:33:22	00:33:25	It took 911 a while to come.
404	00:33:25	00:33:27	I just got a quick pic.
405	00:33:27	00:33:30	You said it-- I'm resourceful, not a murderer.
406	00:33:32	00:33:34	I didn't do it.
407	00:33:40	00:33:44	It seemed more like a fairy tale.
408	00:33:44	00:33:46	Hard living rocker, Izzy Delancy met Dusty DeCosta.
409	00:33:46	00:33:49	They fell in love. He wrote a hit song about her.
410	00:33:49	00:33:55	She was to become his first wife... or was she?
411	00:33:55	00:33:57	Where did you find this?
412	00:33:57	00:33:58	Oh, I dug deep.
413	00:33:58	00:34:07	In a potentially shocking display of distrust and business acumen, Izzy Delancy, after ten years of dating Dusty DeCosta, finally wed her in a beautiful, flower-filled ceremony in Malaysia.
414	00:34:07	00:34:11	The ceremony was everything a girl could hope for-- beautiful, romantic, well-attended.
415	00:34:11	00:34:14	The only thing it wasn't? Legal.
416	00:34:14	00:34:25	Much to Dusty's surprise, years later, after filing for divorce and custody of their then eight-year-old son, Sven, she was shocked to discover that the Malaysian Shaman was not recognized by the United States as an officiant.
417	00:34:25	00:34:29	Izzy has never released an official statement on the subject...
418	00:34:29	00:34:31	Sounds like motive to me.
419	00:34:32	00:34:33	Oh. Hi.
420	00:34:33	00:34:37	Listen, you're going to have to follow me 'cause I'm late for a client.
421	00:34:37	00:34:38	What is it you want?
422	00:34:38	00:34:42	We were wondering if you could tell us about your relationship with Izzy?
423	00:34:42	00:34:44	Oh, God.
424	00:34:44	00:34:46	So I'm a suspect now?
425	00:34:46	00:34:48	That's precious.
426	00:34:48	00:34:59	Okay. The man makes a mint off of singing about our sex life, barely offers a relationship to our son, kicks me out of a house we built together, leaves me with nothing, and now you want to put me in jail?
427	00:34:59	00:35:01	Rich. Really rich.
428	00:35:01	00:35:03	Izzy was a smart business man.
429	00:35:03	00:35:05	He owned all the rights to his music.
430	00:35:05	00:35:06	What does that matter to me?
431	00:35:06	00:35:08	Do I get royalty checks for being his muse.
432	00:35:08	00:35:09	Exactly.
433	00:35:09	00:35:12	But with Izzy dead, the rights go to Sven.
434	00:35:12	00:35:14	Ostensibly you.
435	00:35:14	00:35:16	And you still don't an alibi for the afternoon of Izzy's death.
436	00:35:16	00:35:22	I do, it's just embarrassing to me.
437	00:35:22	00:35:24	The new Mrs. Delancy called a meeting.
438	00:35:25	00:35:33	She tells me about the Olympia offer, Izzy's being difficult about the deal, so would I talk to him because he listens to me still.
439	00:35:35	00:35:36	Had he started sleeping with the nanny yet?
440	00:35:36	00:35:38	Yeah.
441	00:35:38	00:35:40	Did Madeline tell you that was her old job?
442	00:35:40	00:35:42	No. No.
443	00:35:42	00:35:49	Look, I'd like to pin it on her, I really would, but I can't because I was with her at the Espresso Drop all afternoon.
444	00:35:49	00:35:51	I really have to go.
445	00:35:52	00:35:54	What are those drawings on the table?
446	00:35:54	00:35:58	Oh, those are Sven's.
447	00:36:01	00:36:04	Some mothers get sport trophies, I get perfectly rendered skyscrapers.
448	00:36:04	00:36:06	He wants to be an urban planner.
449	00:36:06	00:36:09	He's kind of obsessed with models.
450	00:36:09	00:36:12	You guys let yourself out, okay?
451	00:36:28	00:36:35	If Sven is capable of creating these kind of 3-D renderings, he definitely could've built that Miniature.
452	00:36:35	00:36:37	Son defending the honor of his mother?
453	00:36:37	00:36:39	Name that Greek tragedy.
454	00:36:39	00:36:44	Yes, I'm angry with my father for the way he treated my mother.
455	00:36:44	00:36:50	I'm angry with my father for sleeping with Annie.
456	00:36:50	00:36:55	I'm angry with my father for naming me Sven.
457	00:36:55	00:37:03	But I've been in therapy twice a week since I was six.
458	00:37:03	00:37:08	I'm tired of adults asking me if I'm angry.
459	00:37:09	00:37:12	Besides, I'm...
460	00:37:12	00:37:15	I'm not the only one who's pissed at my dad.
461	00:37:15	00:37:19	Right, but your mom and Madeline are covered.
462	00:37:19	00:37:24	They were together at the time of your father's death.
463	00:37:28	00:37:39	So maybe you were so angry with your father, that you channeled your anger and used your skills as a model builder to build this.
464	00:37:41	00:37:43	And a nice...
465	00:37:43	00:37:46	heavy object to do this.
466	00:38:03	00:38:07	I always faint at the sight of blood.
467	00:38:07	00:38:15	If that's the case, he probably did not commit the murder and he certainly didn't paint the Miniature with his father's blood.
468	00:38:15	00:38:18	And there's a test we can do to prove it.
469	00:38:19	00:38:23	We're using a tilt table and we're injecting him with isoproterenol.
470	00:38:23	00:38:26	We're testing his sensitivity to his vagus nerve.
471	00:38:27	00:38:35	Basically, we're looking to find out if the nerves that control his blood pressure are predisposed to short circuit when he gets an adrenaline rush.
472	00:38:37	00:38:41	You're telling me that this could keep him out of jail?
473	00:38:41	00:38:43	Unless he was faking it.
474	00:39:31	00:39:33	I hear we're out of suspects.
475	00:39:33	00:39:35	Not necessarily.
476	00:39:35	00:39:37	Could be anybody in town.
477	00:39:37	00:39:39	Or anybody out of town for that matter.
478	00:39:40	00:39:41	That's a lot of suspects.
479	00:39:41	00:39:44	What do you want us to do?
480	00:39:45	00:39:48	I don't know.
481	00:39:50	00:39:52	I'll deal with it.
482	00:39:57	00:39:59	I ran DNA on the guy who was holding Lindsey.
483	00:39:59	00:40:00	Did you get a name?
484	00:40:00	00:40:08	Um, kind of. See, this guy has markers that are found in, like, ten percent of the population which reminded me of some other results that I'd been processing recently.
485	00:40:08	00:40:11	13 alleles in common with Robert O'Brien?
486	00:40:11	00:40:16	The suicide from Sam Braun's implosion party.
487	00:40:19	00:40:22	The guy who grabbed Lindsey is Robert O'Brien's brother?
488	00:40:22	00:40:30	Right. So when that came up, I ran all the other exemplars from the O'Brien case, and I got a hit on a piece of hair from the duct tape that they used to bind Lindsey.
489	00:40:32	00:40:34	Joe Hirschoff.
490	00:40:34	00:40:37	O'Brien's partner.
491	00:40:41	00:40:43	Hi, Sam. (chuckles)
492	00:40:43	00:40:47	Everybody in town knows you're here every Thursday night.
493	00:40:47	00:40:49	And usually with my mother.
494	00:40:49	00:40:51	I'll be right along.
495	00:40:51	00:40:53	She doesn't mean a thing.
496	00:40:53	00:40:55	It's all show.
497	00:40:55	00:40:59	Look, Muggs, yesterday was...
498	00:40:59	00:41:00	Just save it.
499	00:41:00	00:41:03	I only came here to tell you to call off your guys.
500	00:41:03	00:41:05	I don't know what you're talking about.
501	00:41:05	00:41:09	Joe Hirschoff and his partner invested everything they had in The Eclipse.
502	00:41:09	00:41:11	But it went bankrupt before you broke ground.
503	00:41:11	00:41:16	You formed a new corporation to finish the project, leaving those guys with nothing.
504	00:41:16	00:41:18	Sometimes that's the way it goes in business.
505	00:41:18	00:41:19	Uh-huh.
506	00:41:19	00:41:22	O'Brien and Hirschoff lost $20 million, right?
507	00:41:22	00:41:26	O'Brien caved and stuck a gun in his mouth.
508	00:41:26	00:41:28	Hirschoff wants you to pay him back.
509	00:41:28	00:41:30	So, where is he?
510	00:41:32	00:41:34	Come on, Sam, this isn't Old Vegas anymore.
511	00:41:34	00:41:36	Let the police handle it.
512	00:41:36	00:41:39	Or have you already killed him?
513	00:41:40	00:41:43	I give you my word, no.
