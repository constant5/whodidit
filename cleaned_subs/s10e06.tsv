0	00:00:40	00:00:41	What's his status?
1	00:00:42	00:00:46	He has multiple contusions and severe lacerations.
2	00:00:46	00:00:48	You know, I should follow and process this kid.
3	00:00:48	00:00:50	I'll be back soon as I can.
4	00:00:50	00:00:51	Still be here.
5	00:00:51	00:00:53	All right.
6	00:00:53	00:00:55	I swear.
7	00:00:55	00:01:01	I swear on the Bible, the Koran and a whole stack of police badges, I ain't do nothing wrong.
8	00:01:01	00:01:02	Then what are you doing in the alley?
9	00:01:02	00:01:04	Looking for my kitty.
10	00:01:04	00:01:05	She's lost.
11	00:01:05	00:01:06	What's your cat's name?
12	00:01:06	00:01:07	Pussy cat.
13	00:01:07	00:01:09	Yeah, now why didn't I know that?
14	00:01:09	00:01:11	Okay, the victim's name is Tommy Baker.
15	00:01:11	00:01:12	He's a local kid.
16	00:01:12	00:01:14	Somebody beat the crap out of him.
17	00:01:14	00:01:16	Business deal gone wrong?
18	00:01:16	00:01:17	What's with all the blood?
19	00:01:17	00:01:19	Don't take that tone with me, Blondie.
20	00:01:19	00:01:21	This is the blood on an innocent Samaritan.
21	00:01:21	00:01:23	Oh, yeah, we got a special on Samaritans.
22	00:01:23	00:01:24	We're arresting them tonight.
23	00:01:24	00:01:25	That's you, your pimp...
24	00:01:25	00:01:27	Hey-hey-hey-hey- hey-hey-hey-hey.
25	00:01:27	00:01:29	I got to work tonight, so here's the straight.
26	00:01:29	00:01:31	I was in the alley with my boyfriend.
27	00:01:31	00:01:33	I got some good stuff for you.
28	00:01:33	00:01:34	Oh, oh.
29	00:01:34	00:01:36	Oh, Lord Almighty.
30	00:01:36	00:01:38	Honey, honey?
31	00:01:38	00:01:39	Are you okay?
32	00:01:39	00:01:42	It looked like somebody put him in a blender or something.
33	00:01:43	00:01:44	Where'd your boyfriend go?
34	00:01:44	00:01:45	He ran off.
35	00:01:45	00:01:47	I don't know.
36	00:01:47	00:01:50	Didn't even scrape me off a tip, but that's okay, because I got his number.
37	00:01:50	00:01:51	Okay.
38	00:01:58	00:02:00	Excuse me. I'm looking for Tommy Baker.
39	00:02:00	00:02:01	Yeah, right down there.
40	00:02:01	00:02:03	Thanks.
41	00:02:06	00:02:07	Excuse me.
42	00:02:07	00:02:09	Hey, are you with the crime lab?
43	00:02:09	00:02:10	Yes, sir. Hey, I'm Mark.
44	00:02:10	00:02:11	I'm Tommy's older brother.
45	00:02:11	00:02:13	Nick Stokes.
46	00:02:13	00:02:14	He's pretty whacked out.
47	00:02:14	00:02:16	It's hard to look at his face, you know?
48	00:02:17	00:02:19	Hey, excuse me.
49	00:02:19	00:02:21	When are we gonna be able to see a doctor?
50	00:02:21	00:02:24	Nobody will talk to me.
51	00:02:24	00:02:26	Doctor hasn't even been in to see Tommy yet.
52	00:02:26	00:02:27	You look like you could use a break.
53	00:02:27	00:02:29	There's a pretty decent vending machine down the hallway.
54	00:02:30	00:02:31	Why don't you go grab something?
55	00:02:31	00:02:32	I'll stay with your brother.
56	00:02:33	00:02:33	All right. Okay?
57	00:02:34	00:02:35	Yeah.
58	00:02:45	00:02:47	Mr. Baker.
59	00:02:49	00:02:50	I'm Nick Stokes.
60	00:02:50	00:02:52	I'm a crime scene investigator.
61	00:02:52	00:02:56	I'm here to photograph your injuries, collect trace and...
62	00:02:56	00:02:59	later, I'll take your clothes from you.
63	00:02:59	00:03:02	I'm sure you want to catch whoever did this to you.
64	00:03:08	00:03:09	Can you tell me what happened?
65	00:03:12	00:03:14	Do you know who did this to you?
66	00:03:24	00:03:26	Get the hell out of here! Huh?!
67	00:03:26	00:03:28	Leave me the hell alone!
68	00:04:08	00:04:09	Hey.
69	00:04:10	00:04:11	That was fast.
70	00:04:11	00:04:13	Yeah, I think we might have a P-Paul.
71	00:04:13	00:04:15	Victim won't cooperate?
72	00:04:15	00:04:18	Mr. Baker went a little nuts, busted my camera.
73	00:04:18	00:04:20	Is he on something?
74	00:04:20	00:04:22	Nah, I think he's just traumatized.
75	00:04:22	00:04:28	I'm gonna have the hospital call me after the doctors examine him.
76	00:04:28	00:04:29	What is going on here?
77	00:04:29	00:04:33	I found five separate bloodletting incidents.
78	00:04:33	00:04:36	Blood spatter, blood spray, drag marks.
79	00:04:36	00:04:38	Whew.
80	00:04:42	00:04:46	How come all the blood over here is still wet, but this blood's dry?
81	00:04:46	00:04:48	Well, this wasn't a hit-and-run, this went on for a while.
82	00:04:48	00:04:50	I found some semen here.
83	00:04:50	00:04:52	Hooker alley.
84	00:04:53	00:04:54	You'd think I would've found more.
85	00:04:54	00:04:56	Mm-hmm.
86	00:05:02	00:05:03	Are you done taking overalls?
87	00:05:04	00:05:05	Yeah, all clear.
88	00:05:11	00:05:13	A Saint Christopher medal with blood on it?
89	00:05:13	00:05:15	Could belong to the victim.
90	00:05:15	00:05:18	Yeah, it didn't do him much good, did it?
91	00:05:18	00:05:21	That's because he's the patron saint of travel.
92	00:05:21	00:05:24	Eddie always used to have one hanging on his rear-view.
93	00:05:24	00:05:26	Didn't help him much, either.
94	00:05:33	00:05:36	Yup. No, I'm staring at it right now.
95	00:05:36	00:05:38	No. All right, sprinklers are off.
96	00:05:38	00:05:40	Thank you.
97	00:05:40	00:05:43	Fire department finally tracked down the main water line.
98	00:05:43	00:05:47	Okay, KQUT traffic chopper spotted smoke 00.
99	00:05:47	00:05:48	00.
100	00:05:48	00:05:51	Did you happen to notice whether or not this was the fire department's handiwork here?
101	00:05:51	00:05:54	You mean the evidence eradication crew.
102	00:05:54	00:05:56	They never checked to see if it was unlocked.
103	00:05:56	00:06:00	They said that there was so much smoke that they had to do a hatchet job on it anyway.
104	00:06:00	00:06:04	I'm going to canvass the neighborhood, see if anybody saw anything.
105	00:06:04	00:06:06	Excuse me.
106	00:06:06	00:06:08	Think we have a camera in the ceiling down here.
107	00:06:21	00:06:23	Victim's only lightly toasted.
108	00:06:23	00:06:27	If someone was trying to burn this place down, they didn't do a very good job.
109	00:06:27	00:06:30	And a seasoned arsonist would've disabled the sprinklers.
110	00:06:30	00:06:35	The fire was probably an afterthought, just an attempt to destroy any evidence.
111	00:06:43	00:06:45	Hmm.
112	00:06:45	00:06:49	This camera's not just a live feed, it's a surveillance camera.
113	00:06:49	00:06:53	Means there's got to be a console around here somewhere.
114	00:06:59	00:07:02	I think I found it.
115	00:07:08	00:07:09	Tape's missing.
116	00:07:09	00:07:11	How surprising.
117	00:07:11	00:07:12	Hey. I'm so sorry I'm late.
118	00:07:13	00:07:14	Just drove in from Pahrump.
119	00:07:15	00:07:17	Sara's got a quintuple in a motel.
120	00:07:17	00:07:18	She's gonna be there for days.
121	00:07:26	00:07:29	Your vic's only been dead a couple of hours.
122	00:07:30	00:07:32	Oh.
123	00:07:36	00:07:38	We got two GSWs to the upper torso.
124	00:07:39	00:07:41	Not through-and-throughs.
125	00:07:41	00:07:43	Wayne Smith, 26.
126	00:07:43	00:07:45	Lives in the area.
127	00:07:48	00:07:51	Wayne Smith, proprietor.
128	00:07:51	00:07:56	So Wayne's here getting ready to open up the store, somebody comes in.
129	00:07:56	00:07:58	Or somebody's here already.
130	00:08:05	00:08:07	Botched burglary?
131	00:08:07	00:08:11	Guess it's more than the economy that's killing small business owners.
132	00:08:35	00:08:36	Hi.
133	00:08:36	00:08:38	I help you?
134	00:08:38	00:08:39	Uh, yes, ma'am.
135	00:08:39	00:08:41	LVPD. I'm looking for Tommy Baker.
136	00:08:43	00:08:44	That's my son.
137	00:08:45	00:08:46	I'm his mom.
138	00:08:46	00:08:49	Can I get you a drink?
139	00:08:50	00:08:52	Uh... no.
140	00:08:52	00:08:54	No, I'm good.
141	00:08:54	00:08:56	Thanks.
142	00:08:59	00:09:05	Did you know your son checked himself out of the hospital against doctor's orders last night, refused treatment?
143	00:09:06	00:09:08	You okay?
144	00:09:08	00:09:10	When was he in the hospital?
145	00:09:10	00:09:12	Last night.
146	00:09:12	00:09:14	You do know your son was assaulted last night, don't you?
147	00:09:14	00:09:17	Really?
148	00:09:18	00:09:20	That boy's always had a temper!
149	00:09:20	00:09:23	I hope that he kicked some ass!
150	00:09:23	00:09:24	Well, he didn't.
151	00:09:24	00:09:25	Is he around?
152	00:09:25	00:09:27	I really need to talk to him.
153	00:09:29	00:09:31	Hey.
154	00:09:31	00:09:32	Mama, what are you doing here?
155	00:09:32	00:09:33	How'd you get in?
156	00:09:33	00:09:34	Hey, honey!
157	00:09:34	00:09:37	Did you know that Tommy was in a fight last night?
158	00:09:37	00:09:42	Mark, I'm sorry to barge in on you like this, but I still need to get your brother's statement, process him, you know?
159	00:09:42	00:09:43	Yeah, sure, of course.
160	00:09:43	00:09:44	But, uh...
161	00:09:44	00:09:45	Tommy's asleep. I'm on my break.
162	00:09:45	00:09:46	I came by to check on him.
163	00:09:46	00:09:48	Oh, okay. I'll get him.
164	00:09:48	00:09:50	No. Mama, you need to go, all right?
165	00:09:50	00:09:51	Get your hands off of me!
166	00:09:51	00:09:52	You know you're not welcome here.
167	00:09:52	00:09:54	Let's go. I want to see my baby!
168	00:09:54	00:09:55	Outside! Take it easy, okay?
169	00:09:55	00:09:56	All right, just give me a minute.
170	00:09:56	00:09:58	Just take it easy. Okay, just give me some money, because... Outside!
171	00:09:58	00:10:00	Take it easy!
172	00:10:00	00:10:01	Outside, Mom!
173	00:10:01	00:10:03	Let's go.
174	00:10:03	00:10:04	That's a police officer, you know?!
175	00:10:05	00:10:06	You are a piece of work!
176	00:10:06	00:10:07	That is an officer of the law!
177	00:10:08	00:10:10	You don't touch your mama like that!
178	00:10:10	00:10:11	I am your mother!
179	00:10:11	00:10:12	You're supposed to respect me! (knocking)
180	00:10:19	00:10:20	Hey, excuse me.
181	00:10:20	00:10:22	I didn't say you could go into my room.
182	00:10:22	00:10:24	It's not your room, it's Tommy's.
183	00:10:24	00:10:25	Where is he?
184	00:10:26	00:10:27	I don't know.
185	00:10:27	00:10:32	He came home, he took a shower, he didn't feel like talking, 00.
186	00:10:32	00:10:35	Figured he went to his girlfriend's, but he's not answering his cell.
187	00:10:35	00:10:38	Look, Mr. Stokes, I'm sorry about your camera.
188	00:10:38	00:10:40	I'm not really worried about the camera.
189	00:10:40	00:10:43	But, believe it or not, there are other cases that could use my attention.
190	00:10:43	00:10:44	You know what I mean?
191	00:10:44	00:10:47	I'm not gonna run all over town playing hide and seek with your brother.
192	00:10:47	00:10:49	You have him call me.
193	00:10:49	00:10:50	Yeah? Yeah.
194	00:10:58	00:11:02	Cash register's cleaned out, but there's a .22 in here.
195	00:11:02	00:11:04	Most likely belonged to the victim.
196	00:11:06	00:11:09	Two fired cartridges.
197	00:11:09	00:11:16	The vic had two gunshot wounds, so he probably pulled it out to defend himself, and then got overpowered.
198	00:11:16	00:11:21	But why'd the killer put the gun back in the register?
199	00:11:23	00:11:24	Langston?
200	00:11:24	00:11:27	Ray?
201	00:11:29	00:11:31	I can answer my own question.
202	00:11:31	00:11:35	You see, Greg, cop pulls you over and finds cash on you, no big deal.
203	00:11:35	00:11:38	Finds a gun, then you're going to jail.
204	00:11:38	00:11:42	Want to bet it's wiped down?
205	00:11:53	00:11:55	Well, looky here.
206	00:11:55	00:11:58	Got a serial number on the bottom of the cash drawer.
207	00:11:58	00:12:05	Lots of mom-and-pops will record the serial number off a 20 and keep it in the drawer as bait money.
208	00:12:05	00:12:10	That way, in case they get robbed, cops have a way to match it.
209	00:12:10	00:12:11	Thanks, Greg.
210	00:12:11	00:12:12	No, thank you.
211	00:12:14	00:12:16	Back door's dead-bolted.
212	00:12:21	00:12:22	Window's unlocked.
213	00:12:35	00:12:41	Sometimes when God closes a door, Satan opens a window.
214	00:12:43	00:12:46	I'm glad to hear I'm not the only one who talks to himself.
215	00:12:48	00:12:50	I think I found a point of entry here.
216	00:12:50	00:12:51	Really?
217	00:12:51	00:12:52	Can I help?
218	00:12:52	00:12:55	You can start processing what's on that side of the room.
219	00:12:55	00:12:56	All right.
220	00:13:08	00:13:12	I got a bag here with what appears to be blood on it.
221	00:13:23	00:13:24	Looks like Jack Sparrow's been here.
222	00:13:24	00:13:28	I don't think our vic was making his living from just selling TVs.
223	00:13:28	00:13:30	I don't think this was a random hit.
224	00:13:30	00:13:31	Killer knew his way in and out.
225	00:13:32	00:13:35	Also knew about the surveillance.
226	00:13:35	00:13:40	I'm thinking that our suspect either knew the victim or at the very least knew about his operation.
227	00:13:40	00:13:43	Then why'd he take all the cash and leave the good stuff?
228	00:13:47	00:13:52	Do you know who killed my brother?
229	00:13:52	00:13:54	I mean, do you, do you have any suspects?
230	00:13:54	00:13:55	No, none yet.
231	00:13:55	00:13:58	Hey, don't worry, okay?
232	00:13:58	00:14:00	We're gonna catch the guy.
233	00:14:02	00:14:04	So Wayne lived at home with you and your parents?
234	00:14:04	00:14:06	No, it's just us.
235	00:14:06	00:14:11	Our folks died when I was 13.
236	00:14:11	00:14:14	Wayne had to quit school to keep the store going.
237	00:14:14	00:14:18	When's the last time you saw him?
238	00:14:18	00:14:20	He was heading out when I got up.
239	00:14:20	00:14:23	00. Wayne opens during the week when I'm in school.
240	00:14:23	00:14:25	So you work at the store, too?
241	00:14:26	00:14:29	Did he empty the cash register every night?
242	00:14:29	00:14:32	No. He only goes to the bank once a week.
243	00:14:33	00:14:35	Can I go now?
244	00:14:35	00:14:40	Actually, CSI will need to get your fingerprints just to exclude you, okay?
245	00:14:40	00:14:42	And then I can give you a ride home.
246	00:15:04	00:15:06	Ran a background on Tommy Baker. Got his juvie record.
247	00:15:06	00:15:08	He was a runaway.
248	00:15:08	00:15:09	A drunk mother.
249	00:15:09	00:15:11	Oh, I met her. Still drunk.
250	00:15:11	00:15:15	Did a stint for punching a cop, another for petty theft.
251	00:15:15	00:15:16	He's no angel.
252	00:15:17	00:15:19	I'm thinking that he picked up a hooker...
253	00:15:19	00:15:20	That's 50 bucks extra, baby.
254	00:15:20	00:15:22	Hey-hey-hey-hey- hey-hey-hey!
255	00:15:22	00:15:25	You think you're gonna get some of this sweet stuff without paying?
256	00:15:25	00:15:27	...and her management beat him up.
257	00:15:27	00:15:29	He seems embarrassed about it.
258	00:15:29	00:15:31	I think he just wants it to go away.
259	00:15:31	00:15:36	It could be the same hooker who called 911. Guilty conscience.
260	00:15:36	00:15:37	I'll have Brass pick her up.
261	00:15:37	00:15:39	Maybe she'll roll on her pimp.
262	00:15:39	00:15:41	Won't do any good if Baker won't testify.
263	00:15:41	00:15:44	Hey, guys, I just got the DNA results from the alley.
264	00:15:44	00:15:46	All the blood came from one unknown male.
265	00:15:47	00:15:48	I'm assuming that's probably your victim.
266	00:15:48	00:15:50	Reasonable assumption.
267	00:15:50	00:15:52	But the fluid was actually a mixture.
268	00:15:52	00:15:53	It was semen and blood.
269	00:15:53	00:15:57	So I separated out the swimmers, and a profile came back to a second unknown male.
270	00:15:57	00:16:00	The blood was actually a match to the rest of the blood at the scene.
271	00:16:00	00:16:04	So we got the victim's blood plus an unknown male's semen.
272	00:16:04	00:16:09	Maybe the semen was already there and the blood dropped onto it.
273	00:16:09	00:16:12	No, there was no visible blood on or near the stain.
274	00:16:12	00:16:16	You said that Tommy got violent when you tried to process him?
275	00:16:16	00:16:18	Yeah.
276	00:16:18	00:16:26	He refused medical treatment, he went home and showered, and according to his brother, he wouldn't talk about what happened.
277	00:16:28	00:16:32	If this were a woman, what would you think?
278	00:16:33	00:16:36	I'd think she was raped.
279	00:16:40	00:16:44	Excuse me. I'd like to speak with the nurse that admitted Tommy Baker last night.
280	00:16:44	00:16:45	I admitted Mr. Baker.
281	00:16:45	00:16:50	Uh, checked the paparamedicsmedics' intake sheet; nothing life threatening so I stuck him in a room.
282	00:16:50	00:16:51	Did he say anything?
283	00:16:51	00:16:53	Just that he got jumped after leaving a bar.
284	00:16:53	00:16:57	And did the paramedics draw any blood? They suspected drug use, so they pulled a sample.
285	00:16:57	00:16:59	Do you still have that?
286	00:17:02	00:17:04	Thank you.
287	00:17:14	00:17:17	Miss Martin, Nick Stokes, CSI.
288	00:17:17	00:17:19	I got your name from Captain Brass.
289	00:17:19	00:17:22	Who cares if I'm in the middle of lunch, right?
290	00:17:22	00:17:24	I can come back later.
291	00:17:24	00:17:27	Mm-mm. We never get CSI in Victim Services.
292	00:17:27	00:17:29	Wouldn't want you to waste a trip. What is it?
293	00:17:29	00:17:35	I have a victim who may have been sexually assaulted, but he isn't really in the mood to talk.
294	00:17:35	00:17:37	Sexually assaulted, as in raped?
295	00:17:37	00:17:38	Yeah.
296	00:17:38	00:17:40	Men almost never report it.
297	00:17:40	00:17:44	People think it's a prison thing, but it's just as likely to happen on the outside.
298	00:17:44	00:17:45	This your first?
299	00:17:45	00:17:48	Yeah. Yeah, that's why I'm here, looking for some insight.
300	00:17:48	00:17:54	Your victim was raped in an alley My experience, it means he probably didn't have a strong connection to his attacker.
301	00:17:54	00:17:57	Either they didn't know each other or the connection was casual.
302	00:17:57	00:18:01	And don't be surprised if Mr. Baker never admits he was raped.
303	00:18:01	00:18:06	Odds are you'll probably close the case on lack of cooperation and then make fun of him around the office.
304	00:18:06	00:18:07	Have a nice day, Mr. Stokes.
305	00:18:08	00:18:09	What is your problem?
306	00:18:09	00:18:11	I'm just trying to do my job here.
307	00:18:11	00:18:14	I've watched you guys stand over dead bodies and crack jokes.
308	00:18:14	00:18:17	I still see a human being when all you see is evidence.
309	00:18:18	00:18:22	Which might make you a good investigator, but it also makes you cold, hard people.
310	00:18:22	00:18:28	So you can feel compassion for dead people, but you can't feel it for someone who's alive wearing a badge trying to help?
311	00:18:28	00:18:31	Good luck with that. Enjoy your sandwich.
312	00:18:31	00:18:40	Best way to get Mr. Baker to talk is to let him know that you want to help him, that it's not just a job.
313	00:18:40	00:18:42	Give him my card.
314	00:18:42	00:18:44	He might feel more comfortable talking to a woman.
315	00:18:44	00:18:48	Keep the other one in case you have any more questions.
316	00:18:53	00:18:56	Okay. Thanks.
317	00:19:06	00:19:07	Out with it, Simms.
318	00:19:07	00:19:09	What is up with Ecklie?
319	00:19:09	00:19:11	Excuse me?
320	00:19:11	00:19:13	He said he's not gonna let anybody else pull a Sanders.
321	00:19:13	00:19:15	I don't get to go out in the field.
322	00:19:15	00:19:16	Ah.
323	00:19:16	00:19:19	And the thing that really pisses me off about this...
324	00:19:20	00:19:24	I have recommendation letters from Grissom, Catherine and Nick in my file.
325	00:19:24	00:19:25	It didn't make any difference to him.
326	00:19:25	00:19:26	I mean, this is ridiculous.
327	00:19:27	00:19:28	It's supposed to be a meritocracy.
328	00:19:28	00:19:30	Since when?
329	00:19:30	00:19:31	Et tu, Hodges?
330	00:19:31	00:19:33	It's a bureaucracy.
331	00:19:35	00:19:36	Just keeping it real.
332	00:19:36	00:19:38	You want me to talk to Conrad for you?
333	00:19:38	00:19:39	Yeah, no.
334	00:19:39	00:19:40	I can talk to him myself.
335	00:19:41	00:19:42	You sure?
336	00:19:42	00:19:45	We're in book club together, and Conrad respects my opinion.
337	00:19:45	00:19:48	At least where Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is concerned.
338	00:19:49	00:19:53	I thought you were against me going from lab rat to field mouse?
339	00:19:53	00:19:56	I just want you to be happy.
340	00:20:05	00:20:08	Victim from the electronics store was shot twice.
341	00:20:08	00:20:12	Both bullets entered front to back, but this one's your killer.
342	00:20:12	00:20:15	Did a little samba around the lung and heart.
343	00:20:16	00:20:23	Bullet entered the left lung, hit the anterior aspect of the spine, then ricocheted down into the ascending aorta.
344	00:20:23	00:20:25	.22s will do that. Yeah.
345	00:20:25	00:20:27	You find any soot in his larynx?
346	00:20:27	00:20:35	Well, if you're wondering whether Mr. Smith was breathing when the fire started, he was.
347	00:20:35	00:20:36	Thank you, Doctor.
348	00:20:36	00:20:37	Show ain't over yet.
349	00:20:40	00:20:41	Glasses?
350	00:20:43	00:20:45	I found this under the soot.
351	00:20:45	00:20:47	Bruise is perimortem.
352	00:20:47	00:20:55	Could have occurred any time between one minute and a couple hours prior to death Judging from color and shape, I'd say someone slapped him pretty hard.
353	00:20:55	00:20:56	Maybe the killer.
354	00:20:59	00:21:01	Or it could be unrelated.
355	00:21:01	00:21:06	The zipper on his pants was down, so I swabbed his penis; found a vaginal contribution.
356	00:21:06	00:21:07	He had sex shortly before death.
357	00:21:07	00:21:10	So you're thinking it's a woman. A little slap and tickle?
358	00:21:10	00:21:13	Most men don't slap, they punch.
359	00:21:14	00:21:15	Now the show's over.
360	00:21:15	00:21:18	Not quite yet.
361	00:21:18	00:21:22	Uh, yeah, connect me to pawnshop detail, please.
362	00:21:22	00:21:27	Hi. This is CSI Sanders. I need you to run some serial numbers against your database.
363	00:21:27	00:21:30	The first one is a Patek Phillipe watch.
364	00:21:30	00:21:34	Serial number is Edward-6-Victor-5-Lincoln-2.
365	00:21:35	00:21:44	All right, next one is a diamond ring-- 5-Victor-7-2-1.
366	00:21:44	00:21:46	Pam Harris.
367	00:21:46	00:21:47	Grrlz Club?
368	00:21:47	00:21:48	One, two, three, four.
369	00:22:15	00:22:17	I'm Pam. You're looking for me?
370	00:22:17	00:22:21	Miss Harris, I'm Detective Vartann, LVPD This is Greg Sanders from the crime lab.
371	00:22:21	00:22:22	You reported a ring missing?
372	00:22:22	00:22:24	My engagement ring.
373	00:22:24	00:22:26	If you guys got it, drinks are on me, all night.
374	00:22:26	00:22:29	We wish we could take you up on that.
375	00:22:29	00:22:30	So you caught the guy?
376	00:22:30	00:22:33	Do you recognize this man?
377	00:22:33	00:22:34	Wayne?
378	00:22:34	00:22:35	Are you kidding me?
379	00:22:36	00:22:39	Angela, get your ass over here.
380	00:22:39	00:22:42	These guys want to know about Wayne.
381	00:22:42	00:22:44	I told you not to date customers.
382	00:22:44	00:22:45	Wayne's my boyfriend.
383	00:22:45	00:22:47	He's not in any trouble, is he?
384	00:22:47	00:22:50	Did you know Wayne was fencing stolen goods?
385	00:22:50	00:22:52	No way. He sells TV's.
386	00:22:53	00:22:58	But I lost my sapphire necklace just last week, and Wayne kept telling me it must be in my apartment.
387	00:22:58	00:23:01	That dirtbag!
388	00:23:01	00:23:04	I'll tell you where he lives, and I'll press charges.
389	00:23:04	00:23:07	Well, that won't be necessary.
390	00:23:08	00:23:09	He's dead.
391	00:23:10	00:23:11	Oh, my God.
392	00:23:15	00:23:19	I ran this three times, and I kept getting exactly the same results.
393	00:23:19	00:23:22	I think I cross-contaminated your samples.
394	00:23:22	00:23:24	All right...
395	00:23:24	00:23:26	first of all, what are your results?
396	00:23:26	00:23:32	Well, the fluid from the alley came back as a mixture of Tommy Baker's blood mixed with Wayne Smith's semen.
397	00:23:32	00:23:34	Wayne Smith? That's our victim.
398	00:23:34	00:23:39	Right. And then the blood from the bag that you two found at the store came back as Tommy Baker.
399	00:23:39	00:23:41	That's our victim from the alley.
400	00:23:41	00:23:43	Not a mixture, just a single profile?
401	00:23:43	00:23:46	Yeah. That's why I confirmed it in triplicate.
402	00:23:46	00:23:54	Okay, so if there was cross-contamination or commingling, there'd be a mixture of profiles on the bag, too.
403	00:23:54	00:23:59	Unless it's an additional lab error, and it's from a third, unrelated case?
404	00:23:59	00:24:07	Knowing Wendy's process and lab procedure, with only one case open at a time, I'd say that's... impossible.
405	00:24:08	00:24:12	So if there's no cross-contamination, then there's a connection.
406	00:24:12	00:24:15	It means that Wayne Smith sexually assaulted Tommy Baker.
407	00:24:22	00:24:25	Which gave Tommy motive to kill the bastard.
408	00:24:26	00:24:28	If I were Tommy, I would've killed him, too.
409	00:24:34	00:24:35	Hey, look.
410	00:24:35	00:24:38	I found a Franken-Blob.
411	00:24:38	00:24:41	That could be our missing surveillance tape.
412	00:24:41	00:24:44	Mm, it's pretty destroyed.
413	00:24:44	00:24:47	Archie's gonna have a hard time with this one.
414	00:24:49	00:24:51	Hmm.
415	00:24:53	00:25:01	We didn't find any evidence of accelerant at the scene, but these could be our ignition source.
416	00:25:01	00:25:02	Maybe you can pull DNA.
417	00:25:02	00:25:10	I knew you were taking a lot of classes-- I didn't realize you knew all about DNA. No, I don't know all about it... yet. (laughs)
418	00:25:10	00:25:21	But I did learn that burn materials used to be collected in paint cans and plastic bags, which preserves accelerant but destroys DNA, which, until recently, no one knew could survive fire damage.
419	00:25:21	00:25:22	I take it you passed.
420	00:25:23	00:25:25	You take it right.
421	00:25:25	00:25:27	Mm, the stems are limp; that means they got wet.
422	00:25:27	00:25:30	Unfortunately, DNA can't survive on burn material once it's wet.
423	00:25:36	00:25:38	Well...
424	00:25:38	00:25:41	Wendy, these babies look dry.
425	00:25:51	00:25:53	Where have you been?
426	00:25:53	00:25:54	I was dialoguing with Conrad.
427	00:25:54	00:25:55	What else have you been touching?
428	00:25:56	00:25:58	Have you run the trace from my cash tray?
429	00:26:04	00:26:06	Dust bunnies?
430	00:26:06	00:26:09	Comprised of dirt, pollen, metal shavings from copper wiring and fecal matter.
431	00:26:09	00:26:12	Did you know that most dust contains trace amounts of poop?
432	00:26:12	00:26:14	Even in hospitals.
433	00:26:14	00:26:17	What about the white fragment?
434	00:26:17	00:26:18	Eh, still in the works.
435	00:26:18	00:26:22	All right, I know you're dying to know, so I'm just gonna tell you.
436	00:26:22	00:26:28	I was talking to Onrad-Cay about Endy-Way and an ansfer-tray to the ield-fay.
437	00:26:28	00:26:30	I... need the trace.
438	00:26:31	00:26:33	Ow-nay.
439	00:26:35	00:26:37	Oser-lay.
440	00:26:40	00:26:42	Ey-hay.
441	00:26:42	00:26:46	The edges of the security tape were melted, but this section survived.
442	00:26:46	00:26:49	It's from the night before Smith was shot.
443	00:26:49	00:26:50	Check out the bag.
444	00:26:50	00:26:55	Now, it looks like the one that we found, but it doesn't have Tommy's blood on it yet.
445	00:26:55	00:26:57	I think this is Tommy.
446	00:26:57	00:26:59	Seems to be avoiding the camera.
447	00:26:59	00:27:01	Does have on similar clothing.
448	00:27:01	00:27:07	The night that Greg and I processed the store, we were under the assumption that it was one event.
449	00:27:07	00:27:10	Wayne interrupted a burglary, the suspect shot him and torched the place.
450	00:27:10	00:27:13	But this proves there were two events.
451	00:27:13	00:27:15	The botched burglary on Thursday night...
452	00:27:15	00:27:17	Bastard! I'm gonna kill you!
453	00:27:17	00:27:18	...the shooting on Friday morning.
454	00:27:18	00:27:21	16 p.m.
455	00:27:21	00:27:24	Wayne assaulted Tommy in the alley a few minutes later.
456	00:27:24	00:27:27	You know...
457	00:27:27	00:27:30	that electronics store was only five blocks away.
458	00:27:30	00:27:35	So... there was a chain of events, assuming that Tommy is our killer.
459	00:27:35	00:27:36	Okay, let it run.
460	00:27:36	00:27:37	All right.
461	00:27:42	00:27:45	What did he just take there?
462	00:27:46	00:27:48	There?
463	00:27:52	00:27:53	That's a St. Christopher medal.
464	00:27:53	00:27:55	You know, I found one of those at my crime scene.
465	00:27:55	00:27:59	Then how did he know it was there, and why did he take it?
466	00:28:01	00:28:03	What is it, Nick?
467	00:28:03	00:28:04	Wayne had a stripper girlfriend.
468	00:28:04	00:28:07	He had sex with a female just moments before he died.
469	00:28:07	00:28:09	Every indication is, this guy was a hetero.
470	00:28:10	00:28:18	So? So, you catch a guy burgling your store, you want to teach him a lesson-- I get it, you beat him, you stab him, you shoot him-- but do you have to rape him?
471	00:28:18	00:28:26	Greek warriors in ancient times would sodomize their enemies after a battle to humiliate them, take their manhood.
472	00:28:26	00:28:30	Yeah, yeah, I understand the concept of humiliation-- rape isn't about sex, it's about violence.
473	00:28:30	00:28:33	But this is a little excessive, don't you think?
474	00:28:33	00:28:35	Well...
475	00:28:35	00:28:38	for some men...
476	00:28:38	00:28:40	violence is their sex.
477	00:28:40	00:28:43	Do you recognize that man?
478	00:28:43	00:28:44	He was in the store Thursday night.
479	00:28:44	00:28:47	We have him on surveillance.
480	00:28:47	00:28:49	No. I've never seen him before.
481	00:28:49	00:28:51	We think he's the one who killed your brother.
482	00:28:54	00:28:56	No, he didn't.
483	00:28:57	00:28:59	How do you know that?
484	00:29:04	00:29:06	Because I killed Wayne.
485	00:29:12	00:29:14	I hated him.
486	00:29:14	00:29:18	Wayne treated me like property.
487	00:29:19	00:29:21	Had all these rules.
488	00:29:21	00:29:23	I couldn't wear short skirts.
489	00:29:23	00:29:26	00 curfew.
490	00:29:26	00:29:29	He would hack into my email.
491	00:29:29	00:29:32	I couldn't sleep over at friends or...
492	00:29:32	00:29:35	or get my own car.
493	00:29:35	00:29:37	He threatened any guy who asked me out.
494	00:29:37	00:29:39	And that's why you shot him?
495	00:29:39	00:29:41	No.
496	00:29:41	00:29:45	I shot him because he liked to hit me when he got mad.
497	00:29:47	00:29:50	Why don't you tell me about that?
498	00:29:51	00:29:58	The first time he hit me was eighth grade, because I wore makeup to school.
499	00:29:58	00:30:03	Wayne said I looked like a whore, and he would know.
500	00:30:03	00:30:07	He was such a hypocrite.
501	00:30:07	00:30:10	Sleeping around, partying, stealing stuff.
502	00:30:10	00:30:13	I'm just trying to understand.
503	00:30:14	00:30:18	Did Wayne, uh, do anything else to you?
504	00:30:18	00:30:22	Isn't that enough?
505	00:30:22	00:30:23	So no one ever noticed?
506	00:30:23	00:30:26	You know, a doctor, a teacher, a friend or anyone?
507	00:30:26	00:30:29	I got real good at hiding it.
508	00:30:30	00:30:33	This is the last thing he gave me.
509	00:30:35	00:30:37	I tried to run away.
510	00:30:37	00:30:39	He always found me.
511	00:30:39	00:30:43	'He thought I was his baby sister, and he wanted to keep it that way.
512	00:30:48	00:30:50	I'm 18 years old.
513	00:30:50	00:30:53	He was never going to let me have my own life.
514	00:31:02	00:31:06	Oh. Now, that looks like you know him.
515	00:31:06	00:31:08	You know, I think I get it now.
516	00:31:08	00:31:13	Your brother, Wayne Smith, caught your boyfriend, Tommy Baker, stealing from his store and assaulted him.
517	00:31:13	00:31:16	And then Tommy came back later and shot Wayne.
518	00:31:16	00:31:20	And then in order to cover up for Tommy, you made up this whole...
519	00:31:20	00:31:23	sequence of lies.
520	00:31:23	00:31:25	No.
521	00:31:27	00:31:31	We were going to get married.
522	00:31:31	00:31:34	We needed money to get out of town.
523	00:31:34	00:31:38	So I came up with this plan to rob the store.
524	00:31:38	00:31:42	But I left my St. Christopher medal, and...
525	00:31:42	00:31:44	I couldn't leave without it.
526	00:31:44	00:31:47	It was my mom's.
527	00:31:47	00:31:50	That's how Tommy ended up on the surveillance.
528	00:31:50	00:31:51	That's the least of his problems.
529	00:31:51	00:31:52	I already told you.
530	00:31:54	00:31:57	I shot my brother.
531	00:31:57	00:32:00	Tommy had nothing to do with it.
532	00:32:02	00:32:04	Don't run!
533	00:32:04	00:32:06	Tommy, stop!
534	00:32:06	00:32:08	On the ground! Hold it right there!
535	00:32:15	00:32:16	What is this?
536	00:32:16	00:32:19	It's the number of someone who might be able to help you.
537	00:32:21	00:32:24	Listen, Tom, I know what happened to you in that alley.
538	00:32:24	00:32:28	What are you talking about? Hey, rape is a horrible thing, no matter who it happens to.
539	00:32:28	00:32:29	This young lady will...
540	00:32:29	00:32:33	will better understand what it is you might be going through, help keep your manhood intact.
541	00:32:33	00:32:35	I don't know what you're talking about.
542	00:32:35	00:32:36	Nothing happened.
543	00:32:36	00:32:38	Look, W-Wayne beat me up.
544	00:32:38	00:32:40	Okay? He didn't make me some...
545	00:32:40	00:32:44	some bitch. We talked to your girlfriend, Jess-- she claims she's the one that did it.
546	00:32:44	00:32:47	Did... did what?
547	00:32:48	00:32:50	Shot Wayne.
548	00:32:54	00:32:56	I did it.
549	00:32:56	00:32:57	I killed Wayne.
550	00:32:57	00:33:00	Everything was my idea.
551	00:33:00	00:33:03	Well, we found her prints on the unlocked window at the scene.
552	00:33:03	00:33:05	That's conspiracy.
553	00:33:05	00:33:08	I'm telling you right now, Jess had nothing to do with that, okay?
554	00:33:09	00:33:10	I staked that place out for three weeks.
555	00:33:11	00:33:15	And after the robbery went south, after the alley, I went back into the store.
556	00:33:15	00:33:19	And I knew right then that he would never let me see Jess again.
557	00:33:19	00:33:20	Son of a bitch!
558	00:33:31	00:33:36	I want to cooperate with you, Mr. Stokes, 100%, but you got to leave Jess out of this.
559	00:33:36	00:33:38	I can't do that, Tom.
560	00:33:38	00:33:42	Not if the evidence shows me she was involved.
561	00:33:43	00:33:46	So what, you got him here?
562	00:33:46	00:33:48	Mr. Stokes. Yeah?
563	00:33:48	00:33:49	Hey, I just got a call.
564	00:33:49	00:33:50	Tommy's been arrested?
565	00:33:51	00:33:52	(phone ringing) I don't understand.
566	00:33:52	00:33:55	You brother just confessed to killing the man who assaulted him.
567	00:33:55	00:33:57	What?
568	00:33:57	00:33:58	I'm sorry, Mark, I got to take this.
569	00:34:01	00:34:04	Tommy's lying.
570	00:34:04	00:34:06	I shot Wayne Smith.
571	00:34:06	00:34:08	Come again?
572	00:34:08	00:34:10	Then I torched the store to cover it up.
573	00:34:13	00:34:15	This is for my brother.
574	00:34:17	00:34:19	So you shot him with a Colt .45?
575	00:34:19	00:34:20	That's right.
576	00:34:20	00:34:22	What did you do with the revolver?
577	00:34:22	00:34:26	I tossed it in a Dumpster by my house.
578	00:34:26	00:34:30	And you did this because Wayne Smith assaulted your brother-- Tommy Baker?
579	00:34:31	00:34:32	It was more than assault.
580	00:34:33	00:34:36	He raped my brother.
581	00:34:36	00:34:37	Tommy tell you that?
582	00:34:39	00:34:42	I, uh...
583	00:34:42	00:34:44	I figured it out.
584	00:34:48	00:34:53	When I saw the blood, I don't know, I felt sick.
585	00:34:55	00:34:57	What did he do to you, Tommy?
586	00:34:57	00:35:00	You know, you could have just called the police and had Wayne arrested.
587	00:35:00	00:35:04	That would have been the easy thing to do.
588	00:35:04	00:35:06	Then the whole world would know what happened.
589	00:35:08	00:35:12	Tommy would have never been able to live that down.
590	00:35:13	00:35:20	The truth is, it would have been better off if that bastard had just killed Tommy.
591	00:35:20	00:35:24	So we've got three confessions and three suspects.
592	00:35:24	00:35:28	Jess Smith, Tommy Baker, Mark Baker.
593	00:35:28	00:35:34	The DNA evidence on the matchbook puts Mark at the scene.
594	00:35:34	00:35:37	Which proves that he set the fire.
595	00:35:37	00:35:38	But he claims he used a .45.
596	00:35:38	00:35:39	Murder weapon was a .22.
597	00:35:39	00:35:42	Yeah, he's lying about that, but not about the fire.
598	00:35:42	00:35:46	Yeah, he knew Tommy ran out of the house and he assumed his brother did it.
599	00:35:46	00:35:49	He was trying to cover it up to protect him.
600	00:35:49	00:35:54	Grabbed the surveillance tape, tossed it in the box, set the fire.
601	00:35:56	00:35:58	What do we have on Tommy?
602	00:35:58	00:36:02	Motive, opportunity, but no physical evidence putting him in the store at the time of the shooting.
603	00:36:02	00:36:08	Have we considered the possibility that Tommy confessed for the same reason his brother Mark did?
604	00:36:08	00:36:10	To protect the person he loved.
605	00:36:11	00:36:15	Jess-- who has her own reasons for killing Wayne.
606	00:36:15	00:36:18	Could have been Tommy, could have been Jess, could have been both.
607	00:36:20	00:36:23	Okay, maybe we can come at this from a different direction.
608	00:36:23	00:36:28	Whoever shot Wayne, most likely stole the cash from the register.
609	00:36:28	00:36:29	Well, I didn't find any cash in Jess' house.
610	00:36:29	00:36:31	And I searched the Baker boys' apartment and their vehicles.
611	00:36:32	00:36:33	Nada.
612	00:36:33	00:36:35	Then again, the mother could have helped herself to it.
613	00:36:35	00:36:39	CSI Stokes. Stokes, please come to reception.
614	00:36:40	00:36:41	Now what?
615	00:36:41	00:36:43	Ms. Martin.
616	00:36:44	00:36:45	What can I do for you.
617	00:36:45	00:36:46	I just came from Tommy's jail cell.
618	00:36:46	00:36:49	I didn't know Victim's Services was allowed to talk to suspects.
619	00:36:49	00:36:50	He's still a victim.
620	00:36:50	00:36:52	You're the one who gave him my card.
621	00:36:52	00:36:54	Tommy asked me to pass on a message to his brother Mark.
622	00:36:54	00:36:57	Who is also now in jail. What's the message?
623	00:36:57	00:36:59	You know I'm bound by confidentiality.
624	00:36:59	00:37:02	Come on. Why'd you come down here then?
625	00:37:02	00:37:05	I've read Tommy's confession, and the police report.
626	00:37:05	00:37:08	There is no way that kid was brave enough to confront his attacker unarmed.
627	00:37:08	00:37:10	It's very atypical.
628	00:37:10	00:37:12	Like everything in this case.
629	00:37:12	00:37:17	Look, I know you think I'm just a bleeding heart, but I can read victims like you can read fingerprints.
630	00:37:17	00:37:19	Tommy Baker is not a killer.
631	00:37:21	00:37:23	Okay.
632	00:37:23	00:37:25	Okay, I'll keep that under consideration.
633	00:37:27	00:37:29	I don't think you're a bleeding heart.
634	00:37:30	00:37:34	I appreciate the help.
635	00:37:39	00:37:41	Your white fragment.
636	00:37:41	00:37:43	Ran MICRO-FTIR.
637	00:37:43	00:37:45	Came back synthetic.
638	00:37:45	00:37:46	More specifically acrylic.
639	00:37:46	00:37:49	With a layer of Snow White nail polish on top.
640	00:37:52	00:37:54	French tips.
641	00:37:54	00:37:57	My mother wears acrylics...
642	00:38:03	00:38:05	Hey, Ms. Paulson.
643	00:38:05	00:38:06	Hey, officers.
644	00:38:06	00:38:09	Did you find my necklace?
645	00:38:09	00:38:12	No, but we think we found out who killed your boyfriend Wayne.
646	00:38:12	00:38:15	Really? Who was it?
647	00:38:15	00:38:16	You.
648	00:38:18	00:38:20	This is a search warrant.
649	00:38:20	00:38:23	I'll take that, thank you.
650	00:38:31	00:38:34	Same serial number as the bait money.
651	00:38:34	00:38:37	Stop! Why don't you tell me that you love it, huh?
652	00:38:37	00:38:38	Don't! I don't want to!
653	00:38:38	00:38:40	I got to get to work.
654	00:38:40	00:38:43	What? I'm not man enough for you? Just give me my money.
655	00:38:43	00:38:45	I want my cut for all the stuff I stole.
656	00:38:45	00:38:47	That's for the dress I bought you.
657	00:38:47	00:38:49	You owe me for the trip.
658	00:38:49	00:38:50	That was a gift you ass!
659	00:38:53	00:38:55	Get that thing out of my face! (gunshot)
660	00:39:03	00:39:05	You're under arrest for the murder of Wayne Smith.
661	00:39:05	00:39:06	It wasn't my fault.
662	00:39:06	00:39:08	I wiped off the gun and took what he owed me.
663	00:39:08	00:39:10	It was self-defense. Keep still, ma'am, please.
664	00:39:10	00:39:11	Thank you.
665	00:39:12	00:39:14	You're free to go.
666	00:39:14	00:39:16	They're just finishing up some paperwork.
667	00:39:16	00:39:18	But I need to ask you...
668	00:39:19	00:39:22	How did Wayne know that Tommy would be at the store?
669	00:39:22	00:39:23	He didn't.
670	00:39:26	00:39:28	Wayne was supposed to be at home with me.
671	00:39:30	00:39:32	This whole thing was my fault.
672	00:39:34	00:39:39	My brother was obsessed with me staying a virgin.
673	00:39:39	00:39:41	He had no clue Tommy and I were having sex.
674	00:39:41	00:39:44	Tommy would always come over when Wayne was at work.
675	00:39:44	00:39:45	No, wait, no.
676	00:39:45	00:39:46	Oh, I ripped your shirt.
677	00:39:46	00:39:49	I'm sorry.
678	00:39:53	00:39:58	I didn't even think about it when my shirt ripped that night.
679	00:39:58	00:40:00	Then Wayne came home...
680	00:40:04	00:40:06	What the hell happened to you? Nothing.
681	00:40:06	00:40:09	It must have ripped on something.
682	00:40:09	00:40:10	I'm-I'm fine.
683	00:40:13	00:40:14	You had sex, didn't you?!
684	00:40:14	00:40:15	No.
685	00:40:15	00:40:16	No, Wayne, no.
686	00:40:16	00:40:18	I wouldn't.
687	00:40:23	00:40:26	It wasn't like that. It wasn't.
688	00:40:26	00:40:28	It was that Baker kid, wasn't it? Huh?
689	00:40:28	00:40:30	He forced you, didn't he?
690	00:40:30	00:40:32	Didn't he?
691	00:40:32	00:40:34	He went crazy.
692	00:40:34	00:40:38	Took my cell and locked me in my room.
693	00:40:38	00:40:46	I knew Tommy was at the store and Wayne was going there to get his gun, but... I had no way to warn him.
694	00:40:48	00:40:50	So what's going to happen to my brother?
695	00:40:50	00:40:53	D.A.'s gonna charge him with manslaughter.
696	00:40:53	00:40:57	Wayne was still alive when Mark set that fire.
697	00:40:57	00:41:02	Listen, Tommy, I know you've been traumatized.
698	00:41:02	00:41:05	And I want to tell you that, uh...
699	00:41:07	00:41:09	Hey, look at me.
700	00:41:10	00:41:13	If there's anything you need, you call me.
701	00:41:16	00:41:17	Here, take this.
702	00:41:24	00:41:29	Back-back in the alley uh...
703	00:41:29	00:41:30	he said something.
704	00:41:33	00:41:36	I'm going to ruin you like you ruined my sister!
705	00:41:36	00:41:38	It really worked.
706	00:41:38	00:41:44	Because I can't even think about Jess now, without seeing his face.
707	00:41:46	00:41:49	I didn't even fight back.
708	00:41:49	00:41:51	I just froze up, you know.
709	00:41:51	00:41:54	I didn't-- Why couldn't I at least just fight back?
710	00:41:54	00:41:56	It wasn't your fault.
711	00:41:59	00:42:03	Look, Jess doesn't know what happened, and I'm sure not going to say anything.
712	00:42:03	00:42:08	And if you don't want to, that's up to you.
713	00:42:08	00:42:13	But if you really love her and she really loves you, this isn't going to make a difference.
714	00:42:51	00:42:53	Tommy?
715	00:42:57	00:42:59	Tommy...
716	00:43:03	00:43:05	Tommy?
