105	105	00:07:56	00:07:57	He was shot trying to protect himself.	N
106	106	00:07:57	00:08:00	What else, Doc? My mind is painting.	N
107	107	00:08:00	00:08:04	He was paid a little visit from Mr. Muzzle Stamp.	N
108	108	00:08:06	00:08:08	Forced into the tub at gunpoint?	N
109	109	00:08:08	00:08:09	Okay.	N
110	110	00:08:09	00:08:12	Let's play it out.	N
111	111	00:08:12	00:08:15	The killer's got him at gunpoint, right?	Y
112	112	00:08:15	00:08:18	Standing over him like this.	Y
113	113	00:08:18	00:08:19	No!!	Y
114	114	00:08:22	00:08:26	But this time, things got messy.	N
115	115	00:08:26	00:08:28	Royce Harmon didn't fight back.	N
116	116	00:08:28	00:08:31	That's why there was no muzzle bruising to his temple.	N
117	117	00:08:31	00:08:32	Stuart Rampler was resistant.	N
118	118	00:08:32	00:08:34	He didn't want to get into that tub too easily.	N
119	119	00:08:35	00:08:37	He took a few jabs to the temple.	N
120	120	00:08:37	00:08:39	But the killer just lost round one.	N
121	121	00:08:39	00:08:44	We know how he gets his vics into the tub and we know that both deaths were homicides.	N
122	122	00:08:44	00:08:45	It's not a bad start.	N
123	123	00:08:51	00:08:54	The skid started way up the road.	N
124	124	00:08:54	00:08:56	I got him doing at least 70.	N
125	125	00:08:56	00:08:59	More like 80.	N
126	126	00:08:59	00:09:02	These grooves are from the car's frame.	N
127	127	00:09:02	00:09:04	It balanced before it fell.	N
128	128	00:09:04	00:09:07	This is where he bailed.	N
129	129	00:09:07	00:09:13	Wide spacing, slipping of the heel.	N
130	130	00:09:13	00:09:15	He ran.	Y
131	131	00:09:16	00:09:18	Who?	N
132	132	00:09:18	00:09:21	The phantom driver.	Y
133	133	00:09:21	00:09:22	Hey, hand me another beer.	Y
134	134	00:09:22	00:09:23	No, you've had enough.	N
135	135	00:09:25	00:09:26	( car horn blaring ) Hey, hey...!	N
136	136	00:09:45	00:09:50	So your drunk driver just got out and ran away?	N
137	137	00:09:50	00:09:51	Where to?	N
138	138	00:09:51	00:09:52	I don't know.	N
139	139	00:09:52	00:09:53	That's why we're up here.	N
140	140	00:09:53	00:09:55	But he left his buddy hanging out to dry.	N
141	141	00:09:55	00:09:56	I can tell you that.	N
142	142	00:09:56	00:10:00	Then how do you explain car number two?	N
143	143	00:10:00	00:10:03	Driver ran to this point, car picks him up.	N
144	144	00:10:03	00:10:05	Here are your tracks...	Y
145	145	00:10:05	00:10:07	Probably took him to the hospital.	Y
146	146	00:10:07	00:10:09	Not if we have these.	N
147	147	00:10:09	00:10:12	They're kind of out of place.	N
148	148	00:10:12	00:10:15	A walking stride up to the edge.	N
149	149	00:10:19	00:10:20	No.	N
150	150	00:10:24	00:10:26	This is a crime, not an accident.	N
151	151	00:10:28	00:10:31	You care to back that statement up?	N
152	152	00:10:32	00:10:34	My phantom driver against your criminal?	N
153	153	00:10:34	00:10:35	How much?	N
154	154	00:10:36	00:10:37	50.	N
155	155	00:10:37	00:10:40	I don't get out of bed for less than a bill.	N
156	156	00:10:49	00:10:50	Hey, Evans.	N
157	157	00:10:50	00:10:52	Hi.	N
158	158	00:10:52	00:10:56	Victim's name is Stuart Rampler.	N

162	162	00:11:04	00:11:07	I bagged a couple of utility bills.	N
163	163	00:11:09	00:11:10	Ready for mail.	N
164	164	00:11:12	00:11:18	It's almost as if he wanted to take care of some unfinished business before he checked out.	N
165	165	00:11:18	00:11:20	Well, it's not likely.	N
166	166	00:11:20	00:11:22	His suicide was staged.	N
167	167	00:11:31	00:11:34	It's an upside-down stamp.	N
168	168	00:11:34	00:11:35	What does that mean?	N
169	169	00:11:35	00:11:37	I don't know.	N
170	170	00:11:44	00:11:47	Wow, this stuff rocks.	N
171	171	00:11:47	00:11:48	I love bathrooms.	N
172	172	00:11:52	00:11:55	Last time I printed a hotel bathroom I had over 1,000 prints.	N
173	173	00:11:59	00:12:02	Okay...	Y
174	174	00:12:02	00:12:04	close the doors and hit the lights, Daddy-o.	Y
175	175	00:12:32	00:12:34	He wiped it clean.	N
176	176	00:12:34	00:12:35	Yeah.	N
177	177	00:12:35	00:12:37	This guy's a real pro.	N
178	178	00:12:37	00:12:40	Not only did he wipe it clean, it's sterile.	N
179	179	00:12:50	00:12:52	I thought you were going to tell me that you caught him.	N
180	180	00:12:52	00:13:01	Mrs. Harmon, we believe that the person who did this to your son may have done it to someone else and we need your help.	N
181	181	00:13:02	00:13:03	Well, what can I do?	N
182	182	00:13:03	00:13:08	We talked to the second victim's girlfriend and played his suicide recording for her.	N
183	183	00:13:08	00:13:12	She confirmed that it was his voice.	N
184	184	00:13:12	00:13:16	But I already told you that the voice on that tape was not my son's.	N
185	185	00:13:16	00:13:19	I know. We just need to be absolutely certain.	N
186	186	00:13:19	00:13:24	Do you have a recording of your son's voice so that we could tie the killings together?	N
187	187	00:13:24	00:13:27	Anything, Mrs. Harmon-- a home movie?	N
188	188	00:13:27	00:13:29	A recorded message off your answering machine?	Y
189	189	00:13:29	00:13:32	All I have are pictures.	Y
190	190	00:13:32	00:13:34	I may have something.	Y
191	191	00:13:34	00:13:40	Royce gave this to me for Mother's Day last year.	Y
192	192	00:13:40	00:13:45	It's a talking frame.	Y
193	193	00:13:45	00:13:49	It's all I have left.	Y
194	194	00:13:49	00:13:51	Hey, Mom, it's Royce.	N
195	195	00:13:51	00:13:55	I know you're always complaining you don't hear my voice in the house anymore.	N
196	196	00:13:55	00:13:58	Well, now you can listen to it anytime you want.	Y

203	203	00:14:13	00:14:15	All right, all right, I get the picture.	N
204	204	00:14:15	00:14:17	How long until we can see him?	Y
205	205	00:14:17	00:14:20	I didn't say you couldn't see him.	Y
206	206	00:14:20	00:14:23	He's sedated.	Y
207	207	00:14:23	00:14:29	If you want to talk to him you're going to have to wait until he comes off his meds in about 12 to 24 hours.	N
208	208	00:14:38	00:14:41	Tan lines, no watch and no ring.	N
209	209	00:14:41	00:14:44	Check his personal effects.	N
210	210	00:14:54	00:14:58	That must have been one hell of a fall to knock his watch and his ring off...	N
211	211	00:14:58	00:15:01	and take his money.	N
212	212	00:15:04	00:15:05	So what do you say?	N
213	213	00:15:05	00:15:09	Do you want to up the stakes another hundred?	N
214	214	00:15:09	00:15:11	To what, a deuce?	N
215	215	00:15:11	00:15:15	Say my foul play against your phantom driver?	N
216	216	00:15:15	00:15:17	You bet.	Y
217	217	00:15:18	00:15:20	Okay...	N
218	218	00:15:20	00:15:23	I've got Stuart Rampler's DNA profile ready.	N
219	219	00:15:23	00:15:27	All I need is something to compare it to.	N
220	220	00:15:27	00:15:28	Coming right up.	N
221	221	00:15:28	00:15:33	Let's see if we can find out who this licker is.	N
222	222	00:15:44	00:15:47	What do you got?	N
223	223	00:15:47	00:15:53	Well, according to the DNA Stuart Rampler licked the right-side-up stamps.	Y
224	224	00:15:53	00:15:55	What about the envelope with the upside-down stamp?	N
225	225	00:15:55	00:15:57	Well, it came back unknown.	N
226	226	00:15:57	00:16:01	He's toying with us.	Y
227	227	00:16:01	00:16:02	Who?	N
228	228	00:16:02	00:16:05	Anonymous.	N
229	229	00:16:10	00:16:13	Superglueing the entire car?	N
230	230	00:16:13	00:16:15	It's a little excessive, don't you think?	N
231	231	00:16:15	00:16:16	Hey, man, this is war.	N
232	232	00:16:16	00:16:22	You know, I checked with six different medical centers, and no phantom driver at any of them.	N
233	233	00:16:23	00:16:24	Minor setback.	N
234	234	00:16:24	00:16:25	How about the 911 call?	N
235	235	00:16:25	00:16:28	Las Vegas cell phone. PD's putting a name to it.	N
236	236	00:16:28	00:16:29	Good.	N
237	237	00:16:29	00:16:31	What's all this?	N
238	238	00:16:31	00:16:33	The car was rented from the airport three days ago.	N
239	239	00:16:33	00:16:34	To...?	N
240	240	00:16:34	00:16:36	Walter Bangler.	N
241	241	00:16:36	00:16:40	I figure Vegas vacation; side trip to Hoover Dam.	N
242	242	00:16:40	00:16:41	Makes sense.	N
243	243	00:16:41	00:16:42	Mm-hmm.	N
244	244	00:16:42	00:16:45	You find his watch and ring?	N
245	245	00:16:45	00:16:48	No.	N
246	246	00:16:49	00:16:51	My pockets are getting fat!	N
247	247	00:16:51	00:16:52	Well, he travels light.	N
248	248	00:16:52	00:16:55	There was only a change of clothes in the damn suitcase.	N
249	249	00:16:55	00:16:56	God, you see all that money in there?	N
250	250	00:16:56	00:16:59	All right, the fumes have settled. Give me a hand.	N
251	251	00:16:59	00:17:00	Yeah.	N
252	252	00:17:13	00:17:15	You can run...	N
253	253	00:17:17	00:17:19	but you can't hide.	N
254	254	00:17:21	00:17:23	Disco Placid-- what's that?	N
255	255	00:17:23	00:17:24	He's a jazz producer.	N
256	256	00:17:24	00:17:26	He specializes in audio.	N
257	257	00:17:26	00:17:28	He does voice comparisons for me from time to time.	N
258	258	00:17:28	00:17:29	He hears in perfect pitch.	N
259	259	00:17:29	00:17:30	Really?	N
260	260	00:17:30	00:17:32	He's gifted.	N
261	261	00:17:50	00:17:52	I'm sorry to hear that.	N
262	262	00:17:52	00:17:55	Oh, that's Bill Withers, man. The man cuts me up inside.	N
263	263	00:17:55	00:17:59	Catherine Willows, Disco Placid.	N
264	264	00:18:01	00:18:03	A pleasure. A pleasure.	N
265	265	00:18:06	00:18:08	How are we coming with our voice comparisons?	N
266	266	00:18:08	00:18:10	Got it right here.	N
267	267	00:18:10	00:18:13	All I got to do is, uh, heat this thing up.	N
268	268	00:18:17	00:18:21	It's a mini-cassette recording of your first victim.	N
269	269	00:18:21	00:18:24	I'm going to kill myself.	N
270	270	00:18:24	00:18:25	I'm comparing the I love yous...	N
271	271	00:18:25	00:18:30	I just can't do it anymore... I love you, Mom...	N
272	272	00:18:30	00:18:33	Now the talking frame.	N
273	273	00:18:33	00:18:39	Well, now you can listen to it anytime you want. I love you.	N
274	274	00:18:39	00:18:40	Minnesota Twins.	N
275	275	00:18:40	00:18:43	The mother was wrong. That is her son's voice.	N
276	276	00:18:43	00:18:49	I laid in both suicide notes in the computer, stripped the tracks one by one.	N
277	277	00:18:49	00:18:52	Picked this up in the b-ground.	N
278	278	00:18:52	00:18:56	My name is Royce Harmon.	N
279	279	00:18:56	00:19:00	I reside at 7642 Carpenter Street Las Vegas, Nevada.	N
280	280	00:19:00	00:19:01	I am 41 years of age.	N
281	281	00:19:02	00:19:04	What is that?	N
282	282	00:19:04	00:19:09	I don't know. It sounds like a flag or a tarp or something.	N
283	283	00:19:09	00:19:11	Give me a sec. I'll give it to you in a Chinese to-go box.	N
284	284	00:19:11	00:19:12	Play the second victim's tape.	Y
285	285	00:19:13	00:19:16	Okay.	N
286	286	00:19:16	00:19:18	My name is Stuart Rampler.	N
287	287	00:19:18	00:19:21	I reside at 818 Boeing Hill Court, Las Vegas...	N
288	288	00:19:22	00:19:25	No. Play it through.	N
289	289	00:19:25	00:19:26	...Nevada.	N
290	290	00:19:27	00:19:30	I am 43 years of age, and I'm going to kill myself.	N
291	291	00:19:30	00:19:32	Play them side by side.	N
292	292	00:19:34	00:19:37	My name is Royce Harmon. Stuart Rampler.	N
293	293	00:19:37	00:19:39	I reside at 818 Boeing Hill 7642 Carpenter Street.	N
294	294	00:19:39	00:19:41	Las Vegas, Nevada.	N
295	295	00:19:41	00:19:43	I am 41/43 years of age.	N
296	296	00:19:43	00:19:45	It's fill in the blanks.	N
297	297	00:19:45	00:19:47	He's just reading from a suicide script.	N
298	298	00:19:50	00:19:52	What do you think?	N
299	299	00:19:52	00:19:55	Disco.	N
300	300	00:19:55	00:19:59	So I've got some good news and mysterious news.	N
301	301	00:19:59	00:20:00	Give me the good news.	N
302	302	00:20:00	00:20:05	Well, your results are back from the prints on the car and your vic Walter Bangler's top on the list.	N
303	303	00:20:05	00:20:07	It's a big list.	N
304	304	00:20:07	00:20:08	You fumed the entire car.	N
305	305	00:20:08	00:20:10	What'd you expect?	N
306	306	00:20:10	00:20:11	What's the mysterious news?	Y
307	307	00:20:11	00:20:15	I found some speckles of blue dust in the ridges of Bangler's print.	Y
308	308	00:20:15	00:20:16	Here. Look.	N
309	309	00:20:21	00:20:22	Let me see.	N
310	310	00:20:25	00:20:27	What do you think?	N
311	311	00:20:27	00:20:31	I have no idea.	N
312	312	00:20:31	00:20:36	I did some comparative digging on both victims-- Royce Harmon and Stuart Rampler.	N
313	313	00:20:36	00:20:41	Both are white males in their 40s, single and... both have the same birthday.	N
314	314	00:20:41	00:20:45	Royce Harmon, born August 17, 1958.	N
315	315	00:20:45	00:20:50	Stuart Rampler, born August 17, 1957.	N
316	316	00:20:50	00:20:52	One year apart.	N
317	317	00:20:53	00:20:56	Okay, so maybe it's some reversed or backwards pattern.	N
318	318	00:20:56	00:20:58	August 17, 1958...	N
319	319	00:20:58	00:21:03	1957. The suicide message was recorded backwards; the postage stamp was upside-down...	N
320	320	00:21:03	00:21:05	Yeah?	N
321	321	00:21:05	00:21:08	Maybe he's telling us in order to go forward, go back.	N
322	322	00:21:08	00:21:12	Sara, go back one more year-- August 17, 1956.	N
323	323	00:21:12	00:21:15	See if anything pops up with the same MO.	N
324	324	00:21:15	00:21:16	I'm gone.	N
325	325	00:21:19	00:21:23	Mr. Grissom, the prints are back from Stuart Rampler's mini-recorder.	Y
326	326	00:21:26	00:21:27	Can we see the print?	N
327	327	00:21:28	00:21:29	Not print-- prints.	N
328	328	00:21:29	00:21:31	What do you mean-- It's more than one person?	N
329	329	00:21:31	00:21:33	It's two thumbprints overlapped.	N
330	330	00:21:33	00:21:34	Can you separate them?	N
331	331	00:21:34	00:21:35	Yeah.	N
332	332	00:21:36	00:21:41	Running both prints through AFIS.	N
333	333	00:21:48	00:21:50	How can that be?	N
334	334	00:21:50	00:21:53	Compliance?	N
335	335	00:21:53	00:21:55	Someone within the department?	N
336	336	00:22:02	00:22:03	What?	Y
337	337	00:22:03	00:22:07	Uh, Catherine, can you excuse us for a moment?	N
338	338	00:22:07	00:22:09	I need to speak with Mr. Grissom in private.	N
339	339	00:22:09	00:22:13	Anything you have to say to me you can say to her.	N
340	340	00:22:13	00:22:17	Well, the top print came back Paul Millander.	Y
341	341	00:22:17	00:22:18	I expected that.	N
342	342	00:22:18	00:22:20	He's the guy who makes the rubber hands.	N
343	343	00:22:20	00:22:21	I've already cleared him.	N
344	344	00:22:21	00:22:23	What about the compliance-- the bottom print?	N
345	345	00:22:24	00:22:25	It came back you.	N
346	346	00:22:28	00:22:30	It's Grissom's print?	N
347	347	00:22:33	00:22:35	Wait a minute.	N
348	348	00:22:35	00:22:37	Somebody got a hold of your prints.	N
349	349	00:22:37	00:22:38	How?	N
350	350	00:22:38	00:22:39	I wear gloves at every crime scene.	N
351	351	00:22:39	00:22:41	I was printed for the job. We all were.	N
352	352	00:22:41	00:22:43	Well, somebody's obviously making this personal.	Y
353	353	00:22:43	00:22:51	They could've gotten your print from a glass that you touched at a restaurant or from a latex glove that you discarded and they turned inside out...	Y
354	354	00:22:51	00:22:54	Oh, God...	Y
355	355	00:22:56	00:22:57	I get it.	N
356	356	00:22:59	00:23:04	Whoever it is is telling me that he's got me under his thumb.	Y
357	357	00:23:16	00:23:20	So... who's your phantom driver?	Y
358	358	00:23:20	00:23:23	Possibly a cop from Philly.	Y
359	359	00:23:23	00:23:27	Or a, a nurse from Omaha.	Y
360	360	00:23:27	00:23:29	Don't forget the mail carrier from Nashville.	N
361	361	00:23:29	00:23:30	Man, it's a rental.	N
362	362	00:23:31	00:23:33	Those prints are probably older than you are.	Y
363	363	00:23:33	00:23:34	Well, this is going nowhere.	N
364	364	00:23:34	00:23:35	You giving up?	N
365	365	00:23:35	00:23:37	No, no, no, no.	N
366	366	00:23:37	00:23:38	We're still on.	N
367	367	00:23:38	00:23:40	I may be stalled, but I'm not out.	Y
368	368	00:23:41	00:23:42	You want to take it to three?	N
369	369	00:23:42	00:23:44	You want to take it to three?	Y
370	370	00:23:47	00:23:49	You still think he was robbed?	Y
371	371	00:23:49	00:23:52	Tan lines where his ring and watch used to be.	N
372	372	00:23:52	00:23:54	On vacation in Vegas, but no money in his wallet.	N
373	373	00:23:55	00:23:58	His face all bruised up before he took that cliffside tumble.	N
374	374	00:23:58	00:24:00	Damn right, I think he was robbed.	N
375	375	00:24:12	00:24:13	Are you all right, man?	N
376	376	00:24:14	00:24:15	Yeah...	N
377	377	00:24:15	00:24:17	Yeah, I guess so.	N
378	378	00:24:17	00:24:20	I want the ring, the watch and all your cash.	Y
379	379	00:24:20	00:24:21	Okay, all right.	N
380	380	00:24:21	00:24:22	Come on...	N
381	381	00:24:22	00:24:23	All right, all right.	N
382	382	00:24:25	00:24:26	Now get your ass in the back.	N
383	383	00:24:26	00:24:28	What?	N
384	384	00:24:28	00:24:30	I said get your ass in the back!	Y
385	385	00:24:34	00:24:35	Strap in.	N
386	386	00:24:35	00:24:36	Okay.	N
387	387	00:24:43	00:24:45	He lays in wait. He robs him.	Y
388	388	00:24:45	00:24:49	He tries to kill him, but he lets him buckle in?	N
389	389	00:24:49	00:24:52	I don't think the robber expected Bangler to get drunk and go crash his car.	N
390	390	00:24:52	00:24:57	He probably freaked and put him in the back seat trying to fool me into thinking someone else was driving.	Y
391	391	00:24:57	00:24:58	But he only fooled you.	Y
392	392	00:25:01	00:25:02	What about the blue dust, Warrick?	N
393	393	00:25:02	00:25:03	What about it?	N
394	394	00:25:03	00:25:05	Don't you think it matters?	Y
395	395	00:25:05	00:25:06	Maybe.	N
396	396	00:25:06	00:25:10	But there's other questions to answer first.	N
397	397	00:25:10	00:25:13	Okay, like?	N
398	398	00:25:13	00:25:15	Footprints and tire tracks.	N
399	399	00:25:15	00:25:17	I hate you.	N
400	400	00:25:17	00:25:18	You love me.	N
401	401	00:25:18	00:25:20	Who you kidding?	N
402	402	00:25:46	00:25:48	Mr. Millander?	Y
403	403	00:25:48	00:25:51	Hey, it's the forensics guy.	N
404	404	00:25:51	00:25:55	I forgot your name. I-I'm sorry.	Y
405	405	00:25:55	00:25:56	Gil Grissom.	N
406	406	00:25:56	00:25:57	Hi, Mr. Grissom.	N
407	407	00:25:57	00:25:58	It's been a couple of months.	Y
408	408	00:25:58	00:26:00	How are you, sir?	Y
409	409	00:26:00	00:26:01	I'm okay.	N
410	410	00:26:01	00:26:02	What are you making?	N
411	411	00:26:02	00:26:05	I-I-I call it...	Y
412	412	00:26:06	00:26:08	Good versus Evil.	Y
413	413	00:26:08	00:26:09	You like it?	Y
414	414	00:26:09	00:26:13	Yeah, it reminds me of our supervisor on days.	Y
415	415	00:26:13	00:26:18	So, what brings you down to my humble abode?	Y
416	416	00:26:18	00:26:21	I have a couple of questions regarding that staged suicide.	Y
417	417	00:26:21	00:26:23	Remember?	Y
418	418	00:26:23	00:26:26	Yeah, how's that going?	Y
419	419	00:26:26	00:26:28	Not too well.	Y
420	420	00:26:30	00:26:34	Say, w-would you like a cup of coffee?	N
421	421	00:26:34	00:26:36	I got instant.	N
422	422	00:26:36	00:26:37	Sure.	Y
423	423	00:26:48	00:26:51	I envy you, Mr. Millander.	N
424	424	00:26:51	00:26:53	I do.	Y
425	425	00:26:53	00:26:57	You can work by yourself... no one around to bother you.	Y
426	426	00:26:57	00:26:59	You just...	Y
427	427	00:27:00	00:27:02	do what you do.	N
428	428	00:27:02	00:27:05	I'd love to have that kind of autonomy.	Y
429	429	00:27:05	00:27:07	It's really all I know.	Y
430	430	00:27:07	00:27:08	I...	Y
431	431	00:27:09	00:27:13	started out doing ice carvings but the artwork never lasted.	Y
432	432	00:27:15	00:27:16	I know what you mean.	Y
433	433	00:27:16	00:27:17	Thank you.	N
434	434	00:27:18	00:27:20	Let's sit.	Y
435	435	00:27:24	00:27:25	How can I help you?	N
436	436	00:27:25	00:27:30	Do you remember the, uh, rubber hand mold that you made from your own hand?	N
437	437	00:27:30	00:27:32	How could I forget?	N
438	438	00:27:32	00:27:36	Well, whoever the perpetrator is has killed again.	N
439	439	00:27:36	00:27:37	And again, your print came up.	N
440	440	00:27:37	00:27:39	So I was hoping you could help me.	N
441	441	00:27:40	00:27:41	Sure.	N
442	442	00:27:41	00:27:47	The last time we talked you told me that you had sold several thousand units last Halloween?	N
443	443	00:27:48	00:27:50	Bestseller, yes, sir.	N
444	444	00:27:50	00:27:53	Could you provide me with a list of your distributors?	N
445	445	00:27:53	00:27:57	I really don't have a list.	N
446	446	00:27:57	00:27:59	Why?	N
447	447	00:27:59	00:28:01	I was hoping to do a credit card search...	N
448	448	00:28:01	00:28:05	go back ten days before the first murder occurred...	N
449	449	00:28:05	00:28:08	try and run some names... see if any priors pop up.	N
450	450	00:28:08	00:28:13	I would really love to help you, Mr. Grissom, but...	N
451	451	00:28:13	00:28:19	I just don't keep track of, of individual purchasers.	N
452	452	00:28:19	00:28:22	I-I-I'm just a wholesaler.	N
453	453	00:28:22	00:28:25	I don't, I don't crunch numbers.	N
454	454	00:28:25	00:28:29	I-I just... spook the children.	N
455	455	00:28:29	00:28:32	Of course you do.	N
456	456	00:28:34	00:28:36	I'm sure you do it well.	N
457	457	00:28:42	00:28:44	Finally...	N
458	458	00:28:46	00:28:50	Hey, partner, did you get a match yet?	N
459	459	00:28:50	00:28:52	Ooh, Converse All-Star.	N
460	460	00:28:52	00:28:53	Size 11.	N
461	461	00:28:53	00:28:55	And you needed all the books for that?	N
462	462	00:28:55	00:28:58	Those soles have been around 20 years.	N
463	463	00:28:58	00:29:00	I needed to be sure.	N
464	464	00:29:00	00:29:01	You look tired, buddy.	N
465	465	00:29:01	00:29:03	You want me to make you a bottle, go nigh-nigh?	N
466	466	00:29:03	00:29:05	You want me to clack that jaw, make you go nigh-nigh?	N
467	467	00:29:05	00:29:07	You should have worked the tire tracks.	N
468	468	00:29:07	00:29:11	Jimmy in Trace put together a digital catalog of treads...	N
469	469	00:29:11	00:29:12	has thousands on file.	N
470	470	00:29:12	00:29:13	Took me three minutes.	N
471	471	00:29:16	00:29:19	Pirelli Low Profile P-Zeros.	N
472	472	00:29:19	00:29:20	High performance.	N
473	473	00:29:20	00:29:23	And standard on your alleged getaway vehicle...	N
474	474	00:29:24	00:29:26	the '99 Bentley Arnage, Red Label.	N
475	475	00:29:26	00:29:28	It's a sweet ride, man, hand-crafted.	N
476	476	00:29:28	00:29:32	So, how many people in Vegas do you think drive that kind of price tag?	Y
477	477	00:29:32	00:29:34	Three.	N
478	478	00:29:34	00:29:35	Did a DMV search.	N
479	479	00:29:35	00:29:37	Any reported stolen?	N
480	480	00:29:37	00:29:38	Yeah, one, last week.	N
481	481	00:29:38	00:29:40	It came in a couple of hours ago.	N
482	482	00:29:40	00:29:41	Take a look.	Y
483	483	00:29:42	00:29:44	Oh-ho!	Y
484	484	00:29:44	00:29:46	So sweet!	Y
485	485	00:29:49	00:29:51	Check this.	N
486	486	00:29:51	00:29:53	One-to-one says that's the car.	N
487	487	00:29:53	00:29:56	Yeah, well, don't bet the sub shop, Warrick.	N
488	488	00:29:56	00:29:58	That's all the evidence you'll get from the Bentley.	N
489	489	00:29:59	00:30:01	We found it at a car wash off Warm Springs.	N
490	490	00:30:01	00:30:02	It's been vacuumed...	N
491	491	00:30:02	00:30:03	detailed, the whole works.	N
492	492	00:30:04	00:30:05	It's cleaner than brand-new.	N
493	493	00:30:05	00:30:10	Well, I wish Bangler's rental car company were as considerate as your thief.	N
494	494	00:30:13	00:30:15	Dr. Livingston.	N
495	495	00:30:15	00:30:17	Your dead man is making cash withdrawals.	N
496	496	00:30:17	00:30:18	Which one?	N
497	497	00:30:18	00:30:20	The first victim or the second?	N
498	498	00:30:20	00:30:22	The second, Stuart Rampler.	N
499	499	00:30:22	00:30:23	The bank called.	N
500	500	00:30:23	00:30:27	His ATM card showed a couple of withdrawals after his time of death.	Y
501	501	00:30:27	00:30:31	ATM machines take photographs every three seconds.	N
502	502	00:30:31	00:30:34	Maybe we can get a Kodak moment of this guy.	N
503	503	00:30:34	00:30:36	I want the machine here.	N
504	504	00:30:36	00:30:39	I want prints. I want film. I want everything.	Y
505	505	00:30:39	00:30:41	The whole machine?	Y
506	506	00:30:41	00:30:42	Yeah, the whole machine.	Y
507	507	00:30:42	00:30:44	Okay.	Y
508	508	00:31:01	00:31:04	You got his clothes?	N
509	509	00:31:04	00:31:05	That's right.	N
510	510	00:31:05	00:31:08	What are you doing? His laundry?	N
511	511	00:31:08	00:31:10	Something to compare our mystery blue dust to.	Y
512	512	00:31:10	00:31:12	Ah.	N
513	513	00:31:12	00:31:15	So... what's the pot up to?	Y
514	514	00:31:15	00:31:16	We don't bet on cases.	N
515	515	00:31:17	00:31:19	Ah, of course you don't.	Y
516	516	00:31:19	00:31:21	So, who's winning?	N
517	517	00:31:21	00:31:24	I am. I am.	Y
518	518	00:31:24	00:31:26	Fiends.	Y
519	519	00:31:35	00:31:38	Your mystery dust is...	Y
520	520	00:31:38	00:31:40	silicon blue dye.	N
521	521	00:31:40	00:31:43	What's that?	N
522	522	00:31:43	00:31:47	Pool cue chalk.	N
523	523	00:31:47	00:31:50	Bangler's shooting stick with the phantom driver...	Y
524	524	00:31:50	00:31:52	tosses a few back... piles into the rental...	Y
525	525	00:31:52	00:31:55	...I-93, Hoover Dam.	N
526	526	00:31:55	00:31:57	But don't drink and drive.	N
527	527	00:31:57	00:32:00	You might spill your drink... car skids...	N
528	528	00:32:00	00:32:01	bangs into the railing...	N
529	529	00:32:01	00:32:04	see-saws...	N
530	530	00:32:04	00:32:05	on the edge...	N
531	531	00:32:05	00:32:07	What does the driver do?	N
532	532	00:32:07	00:32:08	Man, he bails.	N
533	533	00:32:08	00:32:12	He leaves Bangler in the back seat to take the fall.	Y
534	534	00:32:13	00:32:14	Literally.	N
535	535	00:32:20	00:32:23	all the bases are covered.	Y
536	536	00:32:23	00:32:26	Victim, suspect, crime scene.	Y
537	537	00:32:26	00:32:28	Like a laxative...	N
538	538	00:32:29	00:32:31	it works.	N
539	539	00:32:35	00:32:37	Bangler shooting stick, I'll give you that.	N
540	540	00:32:37	00:32:39	Burping bourbons, I'll give you that, too.	N
541	541	00:32:39	00:32:42	But he left solo.	N
542	542	00:32:42	00:32:46	A few miles down the road, Bentley thief flags him down...	Y
543	543	00:32:48	00:32:49	spooks him into a skid...	N
544	544	00:32:49	00:32:50	boom, crash!	N
545	545	00:32:51	00:32:52	He's robbed...	N
546	546	00:32:52	00:32:54	forced into the back...	N
547	547	00:32:54	00:32:56	pushed over the edge.	N
548	548	00:33:00	00:33:03	With Bangler out of the way the thief gets in his stolen Bentley...	N
549	549	00:33:03	00:33:05	hightails it out of there.	N
550	550	00:33:05	00:33:06	No watch...	N
551	551	00:33:07	00:33:08	no rings, no cash...	N
552	552	00:33:08	00:33:14	stolen Bentley tire treads, Converse All-Star size 11...	Y
553	553	00:33:14	00:33:17	all bases covered.	N
554	554	00:33:17	00:33:21	Victim, suspect, crime scene.	N
555	555	00:33:21	00:33:24	And like a canary... it sings.	N
556	556	00:33:29	00:33:32	You know, I hate to admit it...	N
557	557	00:33:33	00:33:35	but I like your theory.	Y
558	558	00:33:35	00:33:36	It does work.	N
559	559	00:33:36	00:33:41	I was sitting here thinking the same thing about your phantom driver.	N
560	560	00:33:41	00:33:43	So, what do you think?	N
561	561	00:33:43	00:33:48	Can two solid theories, each backed by evidence both be correct?	N
562	562	00:33:55	00:33:57	Yeah, there's our guy...	N
563	563	00:34:12	00:34:14	Life...	N
564	564	00:34:14	00:34:16	like holding a dove.	N
565	565	00:34:16	00:34:21	You hold it too hard...	N
566	566	00:34:21	00:34:22	you kill it.	N
567	567	00:34:22	00:34:24	Hold it too soft...	N
568	568	00:34:24	00:34:25	...and it'll fly away.	N
569	569	00:34:30	00:34:32	Have we located this bum?	N
570	570	00:34:32	00:34:35	Brass's guys are looking for him.	Y
571	571	00:34:35	00:34:40	Okay... significance of the flipping?	Y
572	572	00:34:40	00:34:42	He's obviously making a point.	Y
573	573	00:34:42	00:34:43	What does the dove symbolize? Peace.	Y
574	574	00:34:44	00:34:47	But I don't think it's peace in terms of...	Y
575	575	00:34:47	00:34:49	of human civility or unrest.	Y
576	576	00:34:49	00:34:51	I think maybe it's peace of mind.	Y
577	577	00:34:52	00:34:57	What do you have to attain to have peace of mind?	N
578	578	00:34:58	00:35:01	Justice.	N
579	579	00:35:04	00:35:08	I'm going to keep doing this over and over again until I get justice.	Y
580	580	00:35:21	00:35:22	Hi.	Y
581	581	00:35:22	00:35:23	How you doing? Hmm.	N
582	582	00:35:23	00:35:24	How'd you find him?	N
583	583	00:35:24	00:35:28	We canvassed a square-mile radius of the ATM machine.	N
584	584	00:35:28	00:35:31	Started throwing bums hamburgers out the window in a nice tight spiral.	Y
585	585	00:35:31	00:35:34	He ratted him out in 20 minutes.	Y
586	586	00:35:36	00:35:39	You want to tell him how you were approached?	Y
587	587	00:35:39	00:35:42	You know, I think better when I eat.	Y
588	588	00:35:42	00:35:43	No kidding?	Y
589	589	00:35:43	00:35:46	Jim, call The Steak House at Circus.	Y
590	590	00:35:46	00:35:47	Get this fellow a porterhouse.	Y
591	591	00:35:50	00:35:52	How do you like it, medium rare or...	Y
592	592	00:35:52	00:35:55	no, you look like a well-done kind of guy.	Y
593	593	00:35:55	00:35:56	Rare.	Y
594	594	00:36:06	00:36:08	Two minutes, understand?	N
595	595	00:36:08	00:36:10	That's all we'll need.	Y
596	596	00:36:12	00:36:16	Hey, how are you feeling, Mr. Bangler?	Y
597	597	00:36:16	00:36:19	Uh, better, I guess.	Y
598	598	00:36:19	00:36:21	I understand last night was exciting, though.	Y
599	599	00:36:21	00:36:23	Yeah. I'm going to come right out and say it.	N
600	600	00:36:23	00:36:25	What happened to you is not right.	Y
601	601	00:36:25	00:36:28	The person responsible needs to be brought to justice.	N
602	602	00:36:28	00:36:29	You tell me who that person is.	N
603	603	00:36:29	00:36:31	Who was driving that car?	Y
604	604	00:36:31	00:36:33	Who the hell are you guys?	N
605	605	00:36:33	00:36:35	I'm Warrick. I'm Nick.	N
606	606	00:36:35	00:36:36	I'm Nick Stokes.	N
607	607	00:36:36	00:36:37	This is Warrick Brown.	N
608	608	00:36:37	00:36:39	We're with Criminalistics.	N
609	609	00:36:39	00:36:41	We've been working your accident.	N
610	610	00:36:41	00:36:43	Actually, sir, I-I don't think it was an accident.	N
611	611	00:36:43	00:36:49	I think you were robbed and any information that you remember about your attacker would be very helpful.	N
612	612	00:36:49	00:36:50	I wasn't attacked.	N
613	613	00:36:52	00:36:54	I was drunk...	N
614	614	00:36:54	00:36:56	really drunk.	N
615	615	00:36:56	00:36:59	No way I should've been driving that car.	N
616	616	00:37:05	00:37:06	Yeah!	Y
617	617	00:37:09	00:37:11	I guess that's enough for me.	Y
618	618	00:37:11	00:37:12	Then it's time to pay up.	N
619	619	00:37:14	00:37:17	Looks like I'm a little short.	Y
620	620	00:37:18	00:37:20	Hit him.	N
621	621	00:37:20	00:37:21	No, wait.	N
622	622	00:37:27	00:37:29	( horn honking ) Jeez!	N
623	623	00:37:47	00:37:49	You mean you got hustled?	N
624	624	00:37:50	00:37:51	I won the first game.	Y
