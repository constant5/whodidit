0	00:00:11	00:00:12	Green 30!
1	00:00:12	00:00:14	Green 30. Sweep right! Watch the backs!
2	00:00:14	00:00:16	Set! Hut!
3	00:00:23	00:00:26	Burns is tackled... he's goin' for it!
4	00:00:26	00:00:28	Oh! He's hit by the Aztec safety.
5	00:00:28	00:00:29	Time-out! Time-out!
6	00:00:29	00:00:31	(whistle blows) Give me a time-out! Kayle!
7	00:00:32	00:00:34	All right, look, this is it.
8	00:00:34	00:00:37	This is it. Just stay focused, son.
9	00:00:37	00:00:39	It's our will versus their will.
10	00:00:39	00:00:41	Run 2-22 Strike.
11	00:00:50	00:00:53	Nice snap, dropping back...
12	00:00:53	00:00:56	He's got a man open downfield!
13	00:00:59	00:01:00	Oh! He got it! Touchdown!
14	00:02:36	00:02:39	Coach?
15	00:02:39	00:02:41	Coach, you okay?
16	00:02:52	00:02:56	You know the Mustangs were 7 and oh this season?
17	00:02:56	00:02:59	On their way to winning their third consecutive Silver State Bowl.
18	00:02:59	00:03:00	Didn't realize you were a fan, David.
19	00:03:00	00:03:04	My father took me to my first game when I was seven.
20	00:03:04	00:03:05	And it was Coach Miller's first game, too.
21	00:03:07	00:03:10	My father loved this man.
22	00:04:23	00:04:30	Spatter is concentrated on the pillow, the headboard; there's cast-off on the ceiling and the wall.
23	00:04:33	00:04:35	Looks like he was attacked while he was sleeping.
24	00:04:35	00:04:37	A large blood pool under his head.
25	00:04:37	00:04:41	Looks like he laid there for hours, bleeding.
26	00:04:41	00:04:45	And still managed to get out of bed 00 a.m.
27	00:04:45	00:04:47	I turned it off.
28	00:04:47	00:04:49	There wasn't any blood on any of the phones.
29	00:04:49	00:04:55	But he still had the wherewithal to pour himself a cup of coffee and a bowl of cereal, but not call 911.
30	00:04:55	00:04:57	You know how it is with head wounds.
31	00:04:57	00:04:59	Yeah.
32	00:04:59	00:05:01	All right. I got a couple shoe impressions.
33	00:05:01	00:05:05	Coach Miller was barefoot, so this has got to belong to the killer.
34	00:05:09	00:05:11	I spoke to the home security company.
35	00:05:11	00:05:14	04 a.m.
36	00:05:14	00:05:15	So, the security system was on last night?
37	00:05:15	00:05:21	Suggests the killer knew the code, otherwise, how would they get in and out of here without setting it off?
38	00:05:21	00:05:26	I was teaching at WLVU when Coach Miller won his second conference title.
39	00:05:26	00:05:29	Everybody loved him, treated him like a god.
40	00:05:30	00:05:34	Even gods have enemies.
41	00:06:36	00:06:38	Did you find Nemo?
42	00:06:38	00:06:40	Not unless Nemo was a Beemo.
43	00:06:40	00:06:43	Some kids spotted the car over the weekend.
44	00:06:43	00:06:45	Couldn't get a crane here until this morning.
45	00:06:45	00:06:47	Ran the tags.
46	00:06:47	00:06:50	Fleet vehicle from Vegas Legacy Motors.
47	00:06:51	00:06:53	Reported stolen about six months ago.
48	00:06:59	00:07:01	Phew! She's been down there a while.
49	00:07:09	00:07:13	This window's rolled down, that one's broken.
50	00:07:13	00:07:14	She had two escape routes.
51	00:07:14	00:07:18	It looks like she might've gotten stuck in her seat belt.
52	00:07:34	00:07:37	Paige Hammer, 19.
53	00:07:37	00:07:39	North Dakota license.
54	00:07:40	00:07:42	Possibly a tourist or a new resident.
55	00:07:42	00:07:44	Both airbags are deployed.
56	00:07:44	00:07:47	The airbags only go off if someone's sitting in the seat.
57	00:07:47	00:07:49	She wasn't alone.
58	00:07:49	00:07:51	Guess we're looking for the one who got away.
59	00:07:51	00:07:54	So, did you see anyone else when you pulled up?
60	00:07:54	00:07:55	No, sir, just Coach.
61	00:07:55	00:07:57	And I usually keep an extra eye out for his house.
62	00:07:57	00:08:01	You know, he spends a lot of time on the road, so I take in his newspaper and his mail.
63	00:08:01	00:08:03	Then I guess you're the one who turned off the alarm?
64	00:08:03	00:08:04	Was that bad?
65	00:08:04	00:08:05	Yeah.
66	00:08:06	00:08:09	So, is it just you who knows the code or everyone in the department?
67	00:08:09	00:08:11	Pretty much the whole department.
68	00:08:11	00:08:14	Everybody loves Coach M and the Mustangs.
69	00:08:14	00:08:16	Okay, I'm gonna need a list of everyone.
70	00:08:17	00:08:19	I got 'em right here.
71	00:08:19	00:08:21	Put that on for Coach, all right?
72	00:08:21	00:08:23	Did everybody get one? Did everybody get an armband?
73	00:08:23	00:08:26	Yeah, I got one. Did you get an armband?
74	00:08:27	00:08:29	Did everybody get one? She needs one.
75	00:08:33	00:08:35	I'm sorry for your loss.
76	00:08:35	00:08:37	It's more than a loss. It's a tragedy.
77	00:08:37	00:08:45	Coach took a third-rate team with players no other school wanted, turned them into champions with real futures, real degrees.
78	00:08:45	00:08:46	He was one of a kind.
79	00:08:46	00:08:48	I'm Catherine Willows with the Crime Lab.
80	00:08:48	00:08:49	And you are...?
81	00:08:49	00:08:51	I'm Pal Arnold.
82	00:08:51	00:08:53	I'm president of the Booster Club.
83	00:08:53	00:08:55	Did you know Coach Miller well?
84	00:08:55	00:08:56	Like a blood brother.
85	00:08:56	00:08:57	Did he have any family?
86	00:08:57	00:08:59	A wife, any kids?
87	00:08:59	00:09:01	Yeah, about 85 of 'em; the whole roster.
88	00:09:01	00:09:04	Coach always said, Your team is your family.
89	00:09:04	00:09:05	Am I right?
90	00:09:05	00:09:06	That's right. That's right.
91	00:09:06	00:09:10	His wife passed on about ten years ago, and they had no kids.
92	00:09:10	00:09:12	So he lived alone?
93	00:09:12	00:09:13	I wouldn't say that.
94	00:09:13	00:09:14	House was always full.
95	00:09:14	00:09:16	It's the way he liked it.
96	00:09:16	00:09:20	Would you happen to know if any of his extended family had a key to the house?
97	00:09:20	00:09:21	They kind of all did.
98	00:09:21	00:09:23	What do you mean by that?
99	00:09:23	00:09:24	Let me show you, can I...?
100	00:09:24	00:09:26	No, no, just tell me.
101	00:09:26	00:09:29	Um... you see those three rocks there in front?
102	00:09:29	00:09:33	Uh, there's a small rock, uh, on the left-hand side.
103	00:09:33	00:09:35	That's the one, right...
104	00:09:35	00:09:37	Right... your right. That's it.
105	00:09:53	00:09:58	C.O.D.'s exsanguination due to both sharp force and blunt force trauma.
106	00:09:59	00:10:01	Coach was struck at least a dozen times.
107	00:10:01	00:10:03	Lot of rage here.
108	00:10:03	00:10:04	Agreed.
109	00:10:04	00:10:10	The multiple impacts crushed his skull and drove bone fragments into the brain, causing catastrophic hemorrhaging.
110	00:10:10	00:10:17	It's like when you push your finger into a hard-boiled egg-- the shell cracks, but the pieces stay in place.
111	00:10:17	00:10:19	Thanks for ruining another breakfast for me.
112	00:10:19	00:10:21	It's what I do.
113	00:10:21	00:10:23	What about the weapon?
114	00:10:23	00:10:27	Well, you're looking for a wide, flat object with narrow sharp edges.
115	00:10:27	00:10:28	I can't be any more specific than that.
116	00:10:28	00:10:30	Okay.
117	00:10:30	00:10:33	Come on. You're not gonna ask me about the zombie thing?
118	00:10:33	00:10:35	You're obviously eager to tell me.
119	00:10:35	00:10:45	Well, damage was predominantly on the right side of the brain to the neocortex which controls thought, language and reason.
120	00:10:45	00:10:47	It was almost completely destroyed.
121	00:10:47	00:10:51	But the paleocortex, which lies beneath it, remained intact.
122	00:10:51	00:11:02	The paleocortex controls learned instinct and rituals, which explains why the victim was able to brush his teeth and eat his breakfast without noticing that he was bleeding to death.
123	00:11:02	00:11:05	They never seem to get that right in zombie movies.
124	00:11:08	00:11:11	Most of the mud and silt is over here.
125	00:11:11	00:11:15	Tells me the car settled driver's-side down on the lake bed.
126	00:11:15	00:11:18	Yeah, which eliminates using the driver's-side window as an escape route.
127	00:11:28	00:11:29	Lots of diced glass.
128	00:11:29	00:11:31	Must be from the broken window.
129	00:11:31	00:11:34	It is not easy to break one of these.
130	00:11:34	00:11:36	I wonder how she did it.
131	00:11:49	00:11:51	Hey, Sara... Hmm?
132	00:11:51	00:11:52	Got a .38 Smith &amp; Wesson.
133	00:11:53	00:11:59	What? We got to open it up right now and get the cartridge cases out before the gun totally rusts.
134	00:12:01	00:12:05	Mandy, we just recovered a .38 revolver that's been in water.
135	00:12:05	00:12:08	We need a rush on getting it processed.
136	00:12:08	00:12:10	Okay, got it.
137	00:12:11	00:12:13	It's a five-shot.
138	00:12:13	00:12:16	Four live rounds.
139	00:12:16	00:12:17	One cartridge has been fired.
140	00:12:17	00:12:20	This is the most excitement I've had in weeks.
141	00:12:21	00:12:26	Oh, okay. Well, the prints for this are gonna be a long shot, but we'll give it a try.
142	00:12:55	00:12:58	That's a lot of computing power for a football coach.
143	00:12:58	00:13:01	It's a complex game.
144	00:13:01	00:13:07	Two teams, 11 players, each play crafted with multiple levels of redundancy.
145	00:13:07	00:13:11	And yet, most academics and intellectuals prefer baseball.
146	00:13:11	00:13:13	I suppose for the poetry.
147	00:13:13	00:13:15	I just like to watch the guys hit each other.
148	00:13:15	00:13:16	And I like their butts.
149	00:13:18	00:13:20	Check out this photo.
150	00:13:21	00:13:26	Okay, in the photograph, there are two trophies and a football on the top shelf.
151	00:13:26	00:13:31	The Coach of the Year trophy and the football are missing.
152	00:13:36	00:13:41	The remaining trophy has been moved.
153	00:13:43	00:13:45	What do you think?
154	00:13:45	00:13:47	Think it might be a burglary gone bad.
155	00:13:58	00:14:01	The cover-up always leaves behind more evidence.
156	00:14:06	00:14:11	See, one of the downsides to working in law enforcement is that your fingerprints are on file.
157	00:14:11	00:14:13	So when you break the law, you're screwed.
158	00:14:16	00:14:17	Okay, listen, I...
159	00:14:17	00:14:28	Like I said before, I'm a huge Mustang fan, and while I was waiting for your guys to arrive at the scene, I... may have touched one of Coach M's trophies.
160	00:14:30	00:14:31	Oh, you did more than touch.
161	00:14:31	00:14:32	I don't know anything about that.
162	00:14:32	00:14:33	Are you sure?
163	00:14:34	00:14:36	'Cause look at the big bid I just put on BarterBarrel.com.
164	00:14:40	00:14:43	Captain, do you know how much the university pays campus security?
165	00:14:43	00:14:46	Well, I know that prison inmates make 15 cents an hour.
166	00:14:46	00:14:48	Is it less than that?
167	00:14:48	00:14:51	Look, here's what I think happened.
168	00:14:51	00:14:57	I think you broke into Coach Miller's house-- you already admitted to having the alarm code-- you snatched up some valuable memorabilia.
169	00:14:57	00:14:58	You went upstairs hunting for some more.
170	00:14:58	00:15:00	Coach Miller wakes up, you panic, and you grease him.
171	00:15:00	00:15:01	No, no.
172	00:15:01	00:15:03	I loved Coach Miller, all right?
173	00:15:03	00:15:04	Don't go around saying that.
174	00:15:07	00:15:10	All right, I'll cop to stealing the football.
175	00:15:10	00:15:12	Okay, what about the big trophy, the Coach of the Year?
176	00:15:13	00:15:14	No, I only stole the football.
177	00:15:14	00:15:20	I mean, the trophy would've been tempting, but... I don't even remember it being there.
178	00:15:23	00:15:27	C.O.D. should come as no surprise; she drowned.
179	00:15:27	00:15:29	One of my greatest fears, by the way.
180	00:15:29	00:15:38	Can't definitively tell you if she engaged in sexual activity immediately prior to death, but I did find this wedged between her central and lateral incisors.
181	00:15:38	00:15:40	Oh, pubic hair.
182	00:15:40	00:15:42	I'll get it to Wendy.
183	00:15:42	00:15:48	I also found something in her right main stem bronchi.
184	00:15:50	00:15:51	Tempered auto glass.
185	00:15:53	00:15:54	She aspirated it while drowning.
186	00:15:54	00:16:01	Glass particles wash down the trachea, eventually wedging in a pathway of the main-stem bronchi.
187	00:16:01	00:16:04	Confirms that the passenger window was broken after the car was submerged.
188	00:16:04	00:16:05	Mm-hmm.
189	00:16:05	00:16:07	Thanks, Doc. Mm-hmm.
190	00:16:07	00:16:09	Hey, Sara.
191	00:16:09	00:16:10	Ooh. How's it going?
192	00:16:10	00:16:12	I'm, uh, kind of underwater on this one.
193	00:16:12	00:16:13	Yeah, looks like it.
194	00:16:13	00:16:14	Have fun on campus.
195	00:16:14	00:16:16	Will do.
196	00:16:16	00:16:19	Hey, Doc, are these the casts from Coach Miller's head wounds?
197	00:16:19	00:16:22	Yeah. You got a weapon to compare?
198	00:16:22	00:16:27	No... No, just a hunch.
199	00:16:52	00:16:56	So Coach Miller was killed with his Coach of the Year trophy.
200	00:16:56	00:16:58	Mm-hmm. That can't be a coincidence.
201	00:16:58	00:17:00	No, I think Coach knew his killer.
202	00:17:00	00:17:06	And given his penchant for treating everyone like family, that narrows our suspect pool down to...
203	00:17:06	00:17:07	The entire university. Yeah.
204	00:17:07	00:17:14	Bloody shoe impression you found in the bedroom is a size 12 Jupiter Athletic Gear Galaxy One.
205	00:17:15	00:17:16	Last year's model.
206	00:17:16	00:17:17	Mine's current.
207	00:17:17	00:17:19	And I'm sure this is leading somewhere.
208	00:17:19	00:17:22	Yeah, to the gross overcommercialization and corruption of college athletics.
209	00:17:23	00:17:28	See, uh, Jupiter sponsors WLVU football.
210	00:17:28	00:17:30	Yeah, I contacted the Mustang's equipment manager.
211	00:17:30	00:17:34	And he said that Jupiter did donate a pair of Galaxy Ones to every player on the team.
212	00:17:34	00:17:37	How many of them wore size 12s?
213	00:17:37	00:17:41	Five. Four of which have gone on to graduate, which is not unusual for Coach Miller's players.
214	00:17:41	00:17:45	Which leaves us with the star running back Calvin Crook.
215	00:17:45	00:17:48	Is Mr. MVP living up to his name?
216	00:17:50	00:17:52	Where's Archie?
217	00:17:52	00:17:55	He's at a technical conference in Sioux City, Iowa.
218	00:17:55	00:17:57	How can I help you?
219	00:18:00	00:18:04	I'm interested in any e-mails between Coach M and Calvin Crook.
220	00:18:04	00:18:06	Coach had two separate e-mail accounts.
221	00:18:06	00:18:09	One was an .edu through the university, the other was personal.
222	00:18:09	00:18:12	I found an e-mail trail between the two of them back in April. April?
223	00:18:12	00:18:14	Yeah, got a little heated.
224	00:18:14	00:18:15	That's around the time of the NFL draft.
225	00:18:15	00:18:20	Rumor had it that Calvin was gonna skip out on his senior year and enter the draft early.
226	00:18:20	00:18:21	Money, money, money.
227	00:18:21	00:18:23	But he stayed.
228	00:18:23	00:18:25	Yeah, and he lost some of his magic.
229	00:18:25	00:18:27	Wasn't being played as often, and he was playing for free.
230	00:18:27	00:18:34	Most of their back and forth was on the university account, the majority of which was between the coach and Calvin's reps.
231	00:18:34	00:18:36	But... check these out.
232	00:18:36	00:18:43	Coach, Agents are blowing up my cell saying I can enter the draft now and sign for three years, five mil.
233	00:18:43	00:18:44	Calvin.
234	00:18:44	00:18:46	Now comes the tough love.
235	00:18:46	00:18:49	The Mustangs are family, Calvin, and that has more value than money.
236	00:18:49	00:18:51	Money waits for talent.
237	00:18:51	00:18:55	Finish your education, not just for the team but for yourself so you'll have a career after football.
238	00:18:55	00:18:57	Coach M.
239	00:18:57	00:19:02	Five minutes later, the Coach sends Calvin a link to this Las Vegas Globe article.
240	00:19:02	00:19:04	22-year-old restaurant worker found in the lake.
241	00:19:04	00:19:06	Single gunshot wound.
242	00:19:06	00:19:08	Andrew Jimenez.
243	00:19:08	00:19:10	Calvin never mentions the draft again.
244	00:19:10	00:19:12	Because of this article?
245	00:19:12	00:19:15	Well, something made him walk away from five million.
246	00:19:18	00:19:21	I know you're hurting.
247	00:19:21	00:19:23	I'm hurting.
248	00:19:23	00:19:25	But we have to remember what Coach M taught us.
249	00:19:25	00:19:28	What he expected from each of us.
250	00:19:28	00:19:32	We play in that game on Saturday and we play hard.
251	00:19:32	00:19:37	And we honor Coach M by drilling the Cougars into the ground.
252	00:19:37	00:19:39	What did he always tell us?
253	00:19:39	00:19:41	God didn't put us on this Earth to be losers.
254	00:19:42	00:19:43	Win!
255	00:19:43	00:19:45	That's right!
256	00:19:45	00:19:47	Calvin...
257	00:19:47	00:19:48	I'm Nick Stokes.
258	00:19:48	00:19:50	This is Ray Langston, we're with the Crime Lab.
259	00:19:50	00:19:52	We need to ask you a few questions, okay?
260	00:19:53	00:19:54	Sure, sure. Yeah, ask away.
261	00:19:54	00:20:00	Last season you received some Jupiter Athletic Gear, specifically a pair of Galaxy Ones. Yeah.
262	00:20:00	00:20:02	We need to examine them.
263	00:20:02	00:20:04	Well, I don't know what that has to do with anything.
264	00:20:04	00:20:06	And I'd love to help you guys out, but I tossed those months back.
265	00:20:06	00:20:09	The more expensive the kicks, the quicker they wear out I guess, huh?
266	00:20:09	00:20:12	Hey, what can you tell us about Andrew Jimenez?
267	00:20:12	00:20:13	I'm sorry, who?
268	00:20:13	00:20:14	Andrew Jimenez.
269	00:20:14	00:20:16	He was a waiter at Lakeside Pizza.
270	00:20:16	00:20:20	Coach Miller sent you an article on him back in April, didn't he?
271	00:20:21	00:20:22	That's it. I forgot his name.
272	00:20:22	00:20:24	Uh, shot coming home from work.
273	00:20:24	00:20:26	So you two weren't friends? No, no, no.
274	00:20:26	00:20:27	I never met him.
275	00:20:27	00:20:29	See, Coach used to do stuff like that all the time.
276	00:20:30	00:20:32	You know, he'd send me stories to keep my head straight.
277	00:20:32	00:20:34	I was thinking about entering the draft, but...
278	00:20:34	00:20:38	that guy's death just reminded me how short life can be.
279	00:20:38	00:20:39	So it was a life lesson?
280	00:20:39	00:20:42	Our decisions define who we are.
281	00:20:42	00:20:50	If I were to die tomorrow, would I want to be the guy who turned his back on his team for some quick cash or the guy who stayed loyal and led the Mustangs to another victory?
282	00:20:51	00:20:52	The decision was easy after that.
283	00:20:52	00:20:53	You know what? Save it.
284	00:20:53	00:20:58	00 and 6 I was asleep.
285	00:20:58	00:21:00	In my bed.
286	00:21:00	00:21:02	Hey, guys, if you don't mind, I got to get back to practice.
287	00:21:02	00:21:04	Sure. Thanks.
288	00:21:11	00:21:12	Firing two!
289	00:21:47	00:21:52	Hey, that, uh, .38 revolver Sara and I found got a hit on IBIS.
290	00:21:52	00:21:55	It was used in a six-month-old unsolved homicide.
291	00:21:55	00:21:59	And get this-- the victim died of a single gunshot wound.
292	00:21:59	00:22:01	The gun had one expended round.
293	00:22:01	00:22:02	Yeah, and there's more.
294	00:22:02	00:22:07	Bobby Dawson found fragments of tempered auto glass on the tip of the bullet that killed the vic.
295	00:22:07	00:22:09	He couldn't explain it.
296	00:22:09	00:22:12	I think that the bullet shattered the passenger window and then went into his chest.
297	00:22:12	00:22:15	He could be our missing driver.
298	00:22:15	00:22:19	Well, and Doc Robbins found glass fragments in Paige Hammer's bronchi, along with a lot of water.
299	00:22:19	00:22:22	I think that the gun was fired underwater.
300	00:22:22	00:22:25	What's your theory?
301	00:22:25	00:22:31	She's trapped by her seat belt and he realizes that the only way to save her is to save himself.
302	00:22:31	00:22:35	So, he escapes out the window...
303	00:22:35	00:22:38	the car's already listing...
304	00:22:38	00:22:40	and she thinks that he's abandoned her.
305	00:22:40	00:22:42	There's a gun in the car, not sure whose.
306	00:22:42	00:22:49	The only way out is through the passenger window, so she shoots it out (gunshot) not realizing he's on the other side.
307	00:22:49	00:22:51	And he becomes a dead hero.
308	00:22:51	00:22:58	Well, it says here that your vic was found without the shoes, jacket or bicycle he left work with.
309	00:22:58	00:23:02	Do you even have any evidence that he was inside the car?
310	00:23:02	00:23:06	No, but that doesn't necessarily mean he wasn't the driver.
311	00:23:06	00:23:12	All right, just to be safe, let's go back to the lake and canvass the area where we found the car.
312	00:23:12	00:23:20	Okay, but in the meantime, assuming your theory is correct, is it even possible for a bullet fired underwater through glass to actually kill somebody?
313	00:23:29	00:23:31	Andrew Jimenez.
314	00:23:32	00:23:34	That's just really weird.
315	00:23:34	00:23:36	His name popped up in Coach Miller's homicide.
316	00:23:38	00:23:39	Prove your theory.
317	00:23:39	00:23:41	We gotta find out what the hell's going on here.
318	00:23:49	00:23:51	He's Andrew.
319	00:23:51	00:23:54	And this is the car window.
320	00:23:54	00:23:59	We fire the gun through the glass and see if it was possible to shoot him underwater.
321	00:24:06	00:24:07	Firing one!
322	00:24:31	00:24:33	Wound has a depth of two inches.
323	00:24:33	00:24:39	According to the file, Andrew Jimenez had a shallow penetrating wound of approximately two inches.
324	00:24:39	00:24:46	Paige Hammer shot Andrew Jimenez, most likely by accident.
325	00:24:46	00:24:51	So we know that Coach Miller was murdered the day after the BMW surfaced.
326	00:24:51	00:24:54	But was he murdered because the BMW surfaced?
327	00:24:54	00:24:57	Was there any direct connection between Coach Miller and Andrew Jimenez?
328	00:24:57	00:24:58	We haven't been able to find one.
329	00:24:59	00:25:03	Andrew had no ties to WLVU.
330	00:25:03	00:25:05	High school dropout, didn't go to college.
331	00:25:05	00:25:06	Never played sports.
332	00:25:06	00:25:11	Could they be indirectly connected through your female victim? Ah, Paige Hammer.
333	00:25:11	00:25:14	Was new to Vegas, no known address.
334	00:25:14	00:25:17	She was arrested for solicitation six months ago.
335	00:25:17	00:25:21	A hooker doesn't really jibe with Coach Miller's good-guy reputation.
336	00:25:21	00:25:23	According to Andrew's co-workers, it didn't fit his rep either.
337	00:25:23	00:25:25	What about the gun that you found in the car?
338	00:25:25	00:25:27	Unregistered. Untraceable.
339	00:25:28	00:25:29	No prints so far.
340	00:25:29	00:25:30	Mandy's processing the ammo.
341	00:25:30	00:25:34	Okay, this is a bit of a stretch, but your car was a BMW, right?
342	00:25:34	00:25:36	Indeed.
343	00:25:36	00:25:40	Coach Miller drove a Beemer as well-- M5.
344	00:25:40	00:25:46	Oh, ours was a sedan fleet vehicle from Vegas Legacy Motors.
345	00:25:46	00:25:48	Coach Miller's was also from Legacy.
346	00:25:48	00:25:51	Car dealerships are typically big supporters of college football.
347	00:25:51	00:25:52	Look at this guy.
348	00:25:52	00:25:54	I pulled up this site earlier.
349	00:25:54	00:25:56	I know him.
350	00:25:56	00:25:57	He was at the crime scene.
351	00:25:57	00:25:59	President of the team's Booster Club.
352	00:25:59	00:26:01	Pal Arnold.
353	00:26:01	00:26:03	You can always trust your Pal.
354	00:26:03	00:26:05	All right, I'll call Brass, check him out.
355	00:26:21	00:26:22	Welcome, gentlemen.
356	00:26:22	00:26:23	You're just in time for burgers.
357	00:26:23	00:26:24	Grab a brew.
358	00:26:24	00:26:25	I won't tell.
359	00:26:25	00:26:26	We're still working.
360	00:26:26	00:26:31	Mr. Arnold, we found something that-- Everybody calls me Pal, even my ex-wife.
361	00:26:31	00:26:32	Both of them. (laughing)
362	00:26:32	00:26:39	Mr. Arnold, we found something that belongs to you, just down the street, past the golf course, at the bottom of Lake Henderson.
363	00:26:39	00:26:41	A silver BMW?
364	00:26:41	00:26:45	You're kidding me.
365	00:26:45	00:26:47	You found my Beemer?
366	00:26:47	00:26:49	Good work, boys.
367	00:26:49	00:26:51	When you reported it stolen, did you know there was a dead girl inside?
368	00:26:51	00:26:54	Well, it came fully loaded, but a dead girl wasn't part of the package.
369	00:26:55	00:26:57	Do you recognize her?
370	00:26:57	00:26:58	Kind of.
371	00:26:58	00:27:00	I don't know her name.
372	00:27:00	00:27:05	Last spring, just before the draft, I held a little soirée for the team.
373	00:27:05	00:27:07	Red-blooded boys never come empty-handed.
374	00:27:07	00:27:10	This girl was a professional. None of my business.
375	00:27:10	00:27:12	I don't tell them how to run the ball or who to sleep with.
376	00:27:12	00:27:13	Who did she come with?
377	00:27:13	00:27:16	She moved around the room, if you know what I mean.
378	00:27:18	00:27:20	My gut is always right.
379	00:27:20	00:27:21	I figured she jacked my car.
380	00:27:21	00:27:23	How'd your gut figure that?
381	00:27:23	00:27:26	Never saw her before, haven't seen her since.
382	00:27:28	00:27:30	I don't like to get my boys in trouble.
383	00:27:30	00:27:32	Oh, somebody's already in trouble.
384	00:27:32	00:27:33	It was your car, your party.
385	00:27:34	00:27:36	I don't like your attitude.
386	00:27:36	00:27:37	Yeah, I get that a lot.
387	00:27:37	00:27:39	Calvin, come here.
388	00:27:44	00:27:45	Show him the picture.
389	00:27:47	00:27:51	Calvin... tell them how you know the girl.
390	00:27:56	00:27:58	Your burgers are burning.
391	00:27:58	00:28:01	I don't think I should be talking to you without an attorney.
392	00:28:01	00:28:04	Okay, you we can call him from the police station.
393	00:28:09	00:28:11	You see that?
394	00:28:27	00:28:29	Our guy worked at Lakeside Pizza.
395	00:28:45	00:28:47	Possibly pizza sauce?
396	00:28:59	00:29:01	Negative for blood.
397	00:29:01	00:29:06	If Andrew Jimenez was in the car underwater, wouldn't most of the pizza sauce have washed off?
398	00:29:06	00:29:09	You'd think so.
399	00:29:09	00:29:10	His shoes never did get in the water.
400	00:29:10	00:29:14	Because he took them off before he got in-- he wasn't the driver.
401	00:29:14	00:29:16	Help! Somebody help me!
402	00:29:17	00:29:19	Help!
403	00:29:22	00:29:33	Whoever was driving gets out, Andrew dives in to save Paige, gets shot, floats to the surface, which most likely freaks the driver out.
404	00:29:33	00:29:37	He ditches Andrew's clothes in the bushes and takes off.
405	00:29:37	00:29:40	Right place, wrong time for Andrew.
406	00:29:40	00:29:42	No good deed...
407	00:29:43	00:29:45	He's not giving you his DNA.
408	00:29:45	00:29:46	Then we'll compel it.
409	00:29:47	00:29:50	Look, Calvin, I'm gonna be straight with you.
410	00:29:50	00:29:52	You're in a tight spot here, man.
411	00:29:52	00:29:55	We already found one of your hairs on the dead girl, so we know you were with her.
412	00:29:56	00:29:58	If that's true, why do you need his DNA?
413	00:29:58	00:30:01	We know you were at Pal Arnold's house on April 15 with her.
414	00:30:01	00:30:03	Here, let me show you a picture of her.
415	00:30:04	00:30:06	This is what she looks like now.
416	00:30:08	00:30:09	No, go on, Calvin, take a look.
417	00:30:10	00:30:11	Come on.
418	00:30:11	00:30:16	We know you left the party in Pal's BMW, drove to the lake, and then what? What happened?
419	00:30:16	00:30:18	How did the car get underwater?
420	00:30:18	00:30:19	You obviously saved yourself.
421	00:30:19	00:30:21	Were you too much of a coward to save her, too?
422	00:30:21	00:30:22	I mean, that's gotta be eating you...
423	00:30:22	00:30:23	No, that never happened.
424	00:30:23	00:30:26	Andrew Jimenez wasn't a coward, was he?
425	00:30:26	00:30:28	He was a Good Samaritan, trying to help.
426	00:30:28	00:30:31	I know you already told me about him, but you weren't telling me the truth.
427	00:30:31	00:30:34	Which brings us to Coach Miller.
428	00:30:34	00:30:38	Who found out about you and Paige and was gonna blow your chances to go pro.
429	00:30:38	00:30:39	So you killed him.
430	00:30:39	00:30:41	Hmm?
431	00:30:41	00:30:43	I got to tell the truth here.
432	00:30:43	00:30:44	You need to keep your mouth shut.
433	00:30:44	00:30:45	Come on, Calvin.
434	00:30:45	00:30:49	Get this off your chest.
435	00:30:49	00:30:52	This is not who I am and that's not what happened.
436	00:30:54	00:30:56	I loved Coach M.
437	00:30:56	00:30:59	I'd give my life for his right now.
438	00:30:59	00:31:01	I admit I was at the party.
439	00:31:01	00:31:02	I admit I was with that girl.
440	00:31:02	00:31:04	It was a lapse of judgment.
441	00:31:04	00:31:05	I did get in the car with her.
442	00:31:05	00:31:08	But we never even left Pal's driveway.
443	00:31:13	00:31:14	Coach M showed up.
444	00:31:14	00:31:18	He didn't yell, he didn't scream.
445	00:31:18	00:31:20	It'd probably been easier if he had.
446	00:31:20	00:31:24	I'm not angry at you. But I am disappointed.
447	00:31:24	00:31:27	If you want to screw around with your life, that's your decision.
448	00:31:27	00:31:31	But you cannot do that and play football for me.
449	00:31:31	00:31:33	That goes for the rest of you, too!
450	00:31:33	00:31:38	Now pull up your pants, put down the beers and get your asses back to campus!
451	00:31:38	00:31:39	Yes, sir.
452	00:31:39	00:31:40	Pal...
453	00:31:40	00:31:43	you never were what these boys are.
454	00:31:43	00:31:45	And you never will be.
455	00:31:46	00:31:48	Stop trying.
456	00:31:48	00:31:53	I can tell you that... it was a lot harder than being caught by my old man, you know?
457	00:31:53	00:31:54	I looked up to Coach.
458	00:31:55	00:31:57	Then what happened?
459	00:31:57	00:32:00	When Coach M tells you to do something, you do it.
460	00:32:00	00:32:02	I went back to campus.
461	00:32:02	00:32:05	The next few days were brutal.
462	00:32:05	00:32:10	You know, I had agents trying to sign me, fly me everywhere for meetings.
463	00:32:10	00:32:12	Coach M was giving me the silent treatment.
464	00:32:12	00:32:16	And then I got the e-mail.
465	00:32:16	00:32:17	So, this did have something to do with Paige?
466	00:32:21	00:32:25	I didn't know anything had happened to her.
467	00:32:25	00:32:27	I mean, didn't even connect the e-mail to her.
468	00:32:27	00:32:32	I thought this was about me and being at Pal's lake house and goofing off.
469	00:32:32	00:32:35	So I decided to play for the Mustangs one last season.
470	00:32:37	00:32:45	I swear to you, Mr. Stokes, if I'd have been in that sinking car, I'd have done everything I could to save that girl's life.
471	00:32:52	00:32:54	Hey, Ray.
472	00:32:55	00:32:56	You got a second?
473	00:32:56	00:32:58	Yeah.
474	00:32:58	00:32:59	Did you ever play football?
475	00:33:00	00:33:04	Yes, um, the real football.
476	00:33:04	00:33:08	You know, tok-tok, tok-tok-tok, with your feet.
477	00:33:08	00:33:10	Soccer.
478	00:33:10	00:33:11	Well, I never called it that.
479	00:33:11	00:33:16	I was born in Seoul, South Korea, and my dad was career military man.
480	00:33:16	00:33:20	I grew up on bases all over the world, and we just always called it football.
481	00:33:20	00:33:22	What about you?
482	00:33:22	00:33:24	I'm... I'm from Austin. I grew up playing football.
483	00:33:24	00:33:30	You know, I feel like I understand football players, but I don't know about this Calvin Crook kid.
484	00:33:30	00:33:35	At first I thought he was lying to us, but he really came clean with me, man.
485	00:33:35	00:33:37	And now I'm not so sure.
486	00:33:37	00:33:39	Well, what is the evidence telling you?
487	00:33:39	00:33:43	There's no physical evidence connecting him to Coach Miller's murder or to the drowning.
488	00:33:43	00:33:45	So where does that leave us?
489	00:33:45	00:33:53	If Calvin's telling the truth, which I think he is, then Paige Hammer was still alive after Calvin and the rest of the team left Pal's party.
490	00:33:53	00:33:55	Pal didn't leave the party. It was Pal's house, his car.
491	00:33:55	00:33:58	He had to be one of the last people to see her alive.
492	00:33:58	00:34:00	Maybe the last.
493	00:34:00	00:34:05	And if he was the driver, Coach Miller knew about it, that would be motive enough for murder.
494	00:34:05	00:34:07	Can we put him in the car with Paige?
495	00:34:07	00:34:10	I'll check with Mandy, but the gun's the only evidence outstanding.
496	00:34:10	00:34:11	Wait a minute.
497	00:34:11	00:34:18	If we want to catch Coach Miller's killer, we gotta find the murder weapon, right, boss?
498	00:34:19	00:34:24	I need... a couple of volunteers.
499	00:34:26	00:34:27	Okay, I'm in.
500	00:34:31	00:34:34	He would love to. Thanks.
501	00:34:34	00:34:38	Can I at least hear what I'm volunteering for, considering I've just been drafted?
502	00:34:38	00:34:41	Campus police always circled Coach Miller's house.
503	00:34:41	00:34:43	They would have noticed a parked car.
504	00:34:43	00:34:45	I'm thinking the killer approached on foot.
505	00:34:45	00:34:50	And since the killer was most likely associated with the university, that means that he would have walked back to his place on campus...
506	00:34:50	00:34:53	Ditching the murder weapon and blood evidence along the way.
507	00:34:53	00:34:54	Impossible.
508	00:34:54	00:34:56	What are you talking about? It's a great theory.
509	00:34:56	00:34:59	It's a great theory. Thank you. Can we go?
510	00:34:59	00:35:00	I'm eating.
511	00:35:00	00:35:02	There's plenty of food where we're going.
512	00:35:08	00:35:11	You know what this is?
513	00:35:11	00:35:14	Looks like a fingerprint.
514	00:35:14	00:35:17	Yeah. Yours.
515	00:35:17	00:35:24	Found on your .38 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson in your car with a dead hooker at the bottom of a lake.
516	00:35:24	00:35:27	Sounds like you're accusing me of something.
517	00:35:27	00:35:31	I'm not accusing you of anything.
518	00:35:31	00:35:35	I'm charging your with vehicular manslaughter and negligent homicide.
519	00:35:35	00:35:40	Well, why don't you charge me with the JFK assassination while you're at it?
520	00:35:40	00:35:43	No, I'm gonna let you slide on that one.
521	00:35:43	00:35:45	But I could add in a first degree murder of Coach Miller.
522	00:35:45	00:35:47	Now that's not funny.
523	00:35:48	00:35:49	I lose my sense of humor when it comes to murder.
524	00:35:51	00:35:53	Tell me about Paige Hammer.
525	00:35:56	00:35:58	It was an accident.
526	00:35:58	00:36:01	She was hot.
527	00:36:01	00:36:03	The boys had already had some on my dime.
528	00:36:03	00:36:04	My turn.
529	00:36:04	00:36:06	You didn't have to drive me home.
530	00:36:06	00:36:09	Thought you might be interested in a little... overtime.
531	00:36:09	00:36:11	Strictly cash and carry.
532	00:36:17	00:36:19	Next thing I know, airbag was exploding in my face.
533	00:36:22	00:36:24	I can't get out!
534	00:36:24	00:36:27	I said three hallelujahs when that window rolled down.
535	00:36:27	00:36:29	You can't leave me!
536	00:36:29	00:36:30	Let go of me!
537	00:36:30	00:36:33	Please! Help!
538	00:36:35	00:36:37	You can always trust your Pal.
539	00:36:37	00:36:39	I'm not a brave man.
540	00:36:39	00:36:41	When I was safe, I wouldn't have gone back for my own mother.
541	00:36:41	00:36:43	But that doesn't make me a bad guy.
542	00:36:43	00:36:44	It just makes me human.
543	00:36:44	00:36:49	And when that kid showed up, I thought he'd save my ass.
544	00:36:49	00:36:51	Hey, you okay?
545	00:36:51	00:36:54	There's somebody... (coughs)
546	00:36:54	00:36:56	There's a girl in there. You gotta help her.
547	00:37:07	00:37:09	Then his body floated up...
548	00:37:09	00:37:11	and I got the hell out of there.
549	00:37:11	00:37:14	Tossed his clothes along the way.
550	00:37:14	00:37:18	So this kid dies saving your girlfriend...
551	00:37:20	00:37:22	...and you didn't even call 911?
552	00:37:22	00:37:25	I was... I was scared.
553	00:37:25	00:37:27	I wasn't thinking.
554	00:37:27	00:37:32	You were thinking clear enough to hide his clothes in the bushes, cover up the evidence.
555	00:37:32	00:37:35	It's better to be a live coward than a dead hero.
556	00:37:35	00:37:36	Tell me something.
557	00:37:36	00:37:39	How did Coach Miller fit into this whole deal?
558	00:37:39	00:37:42	Just my luck he'd come back.
559	00:37:42	00:37:45	I guess he hadn't finished chewing me out.
560	00:37:45	00:37:47	I was soaking wet.
561	00:37:47	00:37:50	I had to tell him what had happened.
562	00:37:50	00:37:54	He wanted to call the cops.
563	00:37:59	00:38:01	the parties, the booze, the girls.
564	00:38:01	00:38:03	And now two bodies deep-sixed.
565	00:38:03	00:38:05	You weren't going down alone.
566	00:38:05	00:38:09	You know, it's the only time he ever compromised his values.
567	00:38:09	00:38:12	And even then, he did it for the team.
568	00:38:12	00:38:23	So when that car bubbled up, so did Coach Miller's conscience and he finally figured out that he better do the right thing, but you couldn't let that happen, so you killed him.
569	00:38:36	00:38:38	Excuse me.
570	00:38:38	00:38:39	My name is Ray Langston.
571	00:38:39	00:38:41	I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
572	00:38:41	00:38:43	We're gonna need you to dump your garbage.
573	00:39:00	00:39:02	Really?
574	00:39:40	00:39:42	Touchdown!
575	00:39:42	00:39:44	Nicely done.
576	00:39:44	00:39:48	You know, I'm not a CSI by choice.
577	00:39:57	00:39:59	Hey, Hodges? Yep?
578	00:40:01	00:40:04	It's probably for the best.
579	00:40:06	00:40:08	I'm advising my client not to say anything.
580	00:40:09	00:40:10	Then he can just listen.
581	00:40:10	00:40:16	We found your fingerprint in blood on the murder weapon.
582	00:40:26	00:40:29	We also found your Jupiter Galaxy Ones.
583	00:40:29	00:40:31	You told us you had tossed them months ago.
584	00:40:31	00:40:33	In fact, it was just the other night.
585	00:40:33	00:40:37	They matched the bloody shoe impression we found next to Coach Miller's bed.
586	00:40:37	00:40:38	You killed Coach Miller, Calvin.
587	00:40:38	00:40:40	We're not clear on why, but it doesn't matter.
588	00:40:40	00:40:42	No, it matters to me. Calvin...
589	00:40:42	00:40:45	Look, you heard the man; I'm screwed.
590	00:40:46	00:40:55	Mr. Langston... all I've ever known, all I've ever been good at is playing football.
591	00:40:55	00:40:58	I love the game, and it loved me back.
592	00:40:58	00:41:00	And what about Coach Miller?
593	00:41:00	00:41:03	Coach M's head was buried in the past.
594	00:41:03	00:41:04	He was naive.
595	00:41:04	00:41:07	Nobody's cutting you a fat check for team loyalty. Not anymore.
596	00:41:07	00:41:18	Calvin, you want to be the guy who turned his back on his team for some quick cash, or the man who stayed loyal and helped lead the Mustangs to one last victory?
597	00:41:18	00:41:20	Hell, yeah, I wanted to get paid to play.
598	00:41:20	00:41:23	Are you kidding me? I busted my ass. I was entitled.
599	00:41:23	00:41:25	Then what made you stay?
600	00:41:25	00:41:28	That night at Pal's.
601	00:41:28	00:41:29	The dead girl.
602	00:41:29	00:41:32	I didn't even know she was dead. She was just a hooker.
603	00:41:32	00:41:34	I'd forgotten her name by the time she stepped out of the car.
604	00:41:34	00:41:38	I was drunk, stoned, whoring.
605	00:41:38	00:41:40	Coach M had everything he needed to bury me.
606	00:41:43	00:41:46	one last season.
607	00:41:46	00:41:47	He was blackmailing you?
608	00:41:48	00:41:50	Yeah, in so many words.
609	00:41:50	00:41:52	Then why did you kill him?
610	00:41:52	00:41:55	Because he didn't live up to his end of the bargain.
611	00:41:55	00:41:59	He stopped playing me when it mattered; when I had a chance to shine.
612	00:41:59	00:42:00	He's goin' for it!
613	00:42:00	00:42:02	Oh!
614	00:42:02	00:42:04	Time-out! Give me a time-out, ref.
615	00:42:04	00:42:07	Coach, let me run 2-22 Strike. Sit down.
616	00:42:07	00:42:10	But the scouts are here. I need this. Back off.
617	00:42:11	00:42:12	Kayle!
618	00:42:13	00:42:14	Run 2-22 Strike.
619	00:42:14	00:42:16	Yes, Coach. All right, get it.
620	00:42:19	00:42:20	Oh! He got it!
621	00:42:24	00:42:28	He was punishing me for letting him down.
622	00:42:28	00:42:31	Scouts had stopped calling.
623	00:42:31	00:42:35	I could feel my future slipping away.
624	00:42:35	00:42:38	God didn't put us on this Earth to be losers.
625	00:42:38	00:42:43	Well, he didn't put us here to be suckers, either, so I did what I had to do.
626	00:42:43	00:42:46	Did you never stop to think that maybe it wasn't about you, Calvin?
627	00:42:46	00:42:50	Paige Hammer and Andrew Jimenez died.
628	00:42:50	00:42:52	Pal was responsible. Coach knew about that.
629	00:42:52	00:42:54	That had nothing to do with me.
630	00:42:54	00:42:58	Didn't it? Carrying a secret around like that couldn't have been easy for a man like Coach Miller.
631	00:42:58	00:43:04	And I think that every time he looked at you, he was reminded of his own hypocrisy.
632	00:43:10	00:43:16	I was looking out for myself, doing what was best for me, and I'm not gonna apologize for that.
633	00:43:16	00:43:24	But if Coach M were here, he'd say, Calvin, you need to take responsibility for your actions.
634	00:43:24	00:43:28	So that's what I'm doing.
635	00:43:28	00:43:30	I owe him that much.
636	00:43:30	00:43:33	Then you did learn something.
