0	00:00:46	00:00:49	We should have these parties more than once a month.
1	00:00:49	00:00:51	I would, but Mina tends to get jealous.
2	00:00:51	00:00:56	I love you, Chief but if anybody should be jealous, it's you.
3	00:00:59	00:01:01	Who's that guy?
4	00:01:01	00:01:01	Hey, Chief...
5	00:01:01	00:01:03	I didn't know you were into guys.
6	00:01:04	00:01:05	What guy?
7	00:01:51	00:01:53	Daddy?
8	00:02:15	00:02:18	So two nights ago he has a party.
9	00:02:18	00:02:20	High-end guest list, very private.
10	00:02:20	00:02:22	That was the last anyone saw of him.
11	00:02:22	00:02:26	Housekeeper arrives 20 minutes ago.
12	00:02:26	00:02:27	This is what she found.
13	00:02:37	00:02:39	Ex-Chief of Detectives.
14	00:02:39	00:02:41	Left to make the big bucks.
15	00:02:41	00:02:48	Consultant with security at every major casino in town and couldn't even protect himself.
16	00:02:53	00:02:54	Kill the pig.
17	00:02:56	00:02:58	And what about the rest of his family?
18	00:02:58	00:03:00	No sign of the wife.
19	00:03:00	00:03:01	What about the daughter?
20	00:03:01	00:03:04	Housekeeper assumed that she spent the weekend with the grandmother.
21	00:03:04	00:03:06	Assumed?
22	00:03:28	00:03:30	She's gone.
23	00:04:03	00:04:05	His wife and daughter are missing.
24	00:04:05	00:04:08	His silver Cadillac DTS is also missing.
25	00:04:08	00:04:11	We're looking for any signs of forced entry in the house.
26	00:04:11	00:04:15	Any signs of ransack that's not associated with the party. Okay.
27	00:04:15	00:04:16	We need serious damage control.
28	00:04:16	00:04:19	When the media gets a hold of it it's going to be bad for morale all around.
29	00:04:19	00:04:20	Watch your step.
30	00:04:20	00:04:21	I'll take the downstairs.
31	00:04:21	00:04:23	Yeah, I'll be above you.
32	00:04:23	00:04:25	Looks execution-style.
33	00:04:25	00:04:27	At least one shot to the back of the head.
34	00:04:27	00:04:30	A lot of bruising around these handcuffs.
35	00:04:30	00:04:32	So he probably fought back.
36	00:04:32	00:04:34	Without a doubt.
37	00:04:34	00:04:36	Found a shell casing.
38	00:04:37	00:04:41	Looks like one of ours.
39	00:04:41	00:04:45	Nine-millimeter. Standard issue.
40	00:04:45	00:04:48	So where do you suppose the Chief keeps his gun safe?
41	00:05:10	00:05:11	We're in.
42	00:05:15	00:05:17	Thank you, Scott.
43	00:05:18	00:05:21	What do you got?
44	00:05:24	00:05:27	.38.
45	00:05:28	00:05:29	Nice.
46	00:05:29	00:05:32	Pearl handle .25.
47	00:05:32	00:05:33	Clear?
48	00:05:33	00:05:34	Still looking for that .9.
49	00:05:44	00:05:48	So you think the Chief might've kept his signature piece someplace else?
50	00:05:48	00:05:51	For 25 years of distinguished service.
51	00:05:51	00:05:56	An honor like that. Keep it in the case.
52	00:05:56	00:05:58	Yeah.
53	00:05:58	00:06:00	So I'm thinking that the wife might be in on this.
54	00:06:00	00:06:01	Why didn't she plan better?
55	00:06:01	00:06:03	Pack the kid's clothes. What?
56	00:06:03	00:06:06	The nanny told me that she only took one shirt-- one the kid wouldn't even wear.
57	00:06:07	00:06:08	Security guard.
58	00:06:08	00:06:12	No party list but he did see each car that left the night of the party and morning.
59	00:06:12	00:06:15	00 a.m.
60	00:06:16	00:06:18	14 to be exact.
61	00:06:22	00:06:24	You saw Chief Rittle leave?
62	00:06:24	00:06:25	Yeah, he was with his wife and kid.
63	00:06:25	00:06:29	And he had his baseball cap and sunglasses on like always does.
64	00:06:29	00:06:32	So you saw a baseball cap and sunglasses. ( cell phone rings )
65	00:06:32	00:06:34	Did you actually see the Chief's face?
66	00:06:34	00:06:36	Grissom. Well...
67	00:06:36	00:06:37	Actually, I didn't.
68	00:06:37	00:06:40	Brass found the Chief's Cadillac.
69	00:06:40	00:06:42	Who found it?
70	00:06:42	00:06:44	In-house security. Blue jacket.
71	00:06:44	00:06:46	First time he saw the car was Saturday.
72	00:06:46	00:06:48	Chalked the tires twice.
73	00:06:48	00:06:51	Saw the bulletin on the Chief and called us.
74	00:06:51	00:06:52	Any bodies, Joe?
75	00:06:52	00:06:54	I already checked inside the car.
76	00:06:55	00:06:57	We're waiting on you to check the trunk.
77	00:07:02	00:07:03	Whoa.
78	00:07:03	00:07:05	Excuse me.
79	00:07:05	00:07:07	Who is this?
80	00:07:15	00:07:16	Chief Rittle?
81	00:07:16	00:07:19	What is his connection to the Chief?
82	00:07:19	00:07:20	I don't know.
83	00:07:20	00:07:24	But if he has gunpowder residue on him could be our shooter.
84	00:07:24	00:07:26	Okay.
85	00:07:26	00:07:29	Florida Highway Patrol called.
86	00:07:29	00:07:35	Several motorists saw a girl matching Sasha's exact physical description walking along an access road.
87	00:07:35	00:07:36	In Florida?
88	00:07:36	00:07:37	Miami-Dade County.
89	00:07:37	00:07:39	Chief was shot Friday night.
90	00:07:39	00:07:41	It's a two-day drive if you don't stop.
91	00:07:41	00:07:44	It's national news with national attention.
92	00:07:44	00:07:46	I'm not surprised we're getting call-ins.
93	00:07:46	00:07:50	Well, if it is our little girl she's got evidence on her from two Vegas homicides.
94	00:07:50	00:07:54	One of us should be down there to process.
95	00:07:58	00:08:00	Take Warrick. I don't think he's ever been to Florida.
96	00:08:10	00:08:12	She's seven years old!
97	00:08:12	00:08:14	She's wearing a pink shirt!
98	00:08:14	00:08:17	She was last seen by a motorist there!
99	00:08:17	00:08:20	She can be two kilometers in either direction.
100	00:08:20	00:08:23	Think of this area as a quadrant. Divide up.
101	00:08:23	00:08:24	You, north. Got it!
102	00:08:24	00:08:26	You, south.
103	00:08:26	00:08:27	All right, this way.
104	00:08:27	00:08:28	Let's go. ( truck horn blows )
105	00:08:30	00:08:31	Clear out!
106	00:08:31	00:08:32	Watch your back!
107	00:09:48	00:09:49	Sasha?
108	00:09:53	00:09:55	Sasha.
109	00:09:57	00:09:58	My name is Horatio Caine.
110	00:09:58	00:10:00	I'm the head of the Crime Unit.
111	00:10:01	00:10:02	Horatio?
112	00:10:02	00:10:03	Yeah.
113	00:10:03	00:10:05	That's a funny name, isn't it?
114	00:10:05	00:10:10	My mother named me after a famous writer named Horatio Alger.
115	00:10:10	00:10:11	Ever hear of him?
116	00:10:11	00:10:13	Is your badge real?
117	00:10:13	00:10:15	Yeah.
118	00:10:15	00:10:17	Yeah, that's real.
119	00:10:21	00:10:23	My daddy's a policeman.
120	00:10:23	00:10:26	I know that.
121	00:10:26	00:10:27	I knew that.
122	00:10:29	00:10:32	They're looking for me, you know.
123	00:10:32	00:10:36	Me, too. Me, too.
124	00:10:36	00:10:40	What do you say we sit here and get found together?
125	00:10:51	00:10:52	What a day.
126	00:11:01	00:11:03	Burgundy sedan. Caucasian female.
127	00:11:03	00:11:07	Age 32. Traveling with a Caucasian male indeterminate age.
128	00:11:07	00:11:08	I got a female in distress.
129	00:11:08	00:11:11	I want the APB to extend the whole state.
130	00:11:11	00:11:12	Panhandle to the Keys, yes, sir.
131	00:11:12	00:11:13	Good.
132	00:11:28	00:11:30	Horatio Caine.
133	00:11:30	00:11:31	Catherine Willows.
134	00:11:31	00:11:32	Caine. Brown.
135	00:11:32	00:11:34	Child Services has sent a doctor out.
136	00:11:34	00:11:35	All right, let's just be clear.
137	00:11:35	00:11:36	This is a Las Vegas case.
138	00:11:37	00:11:39	This is our victim and we do the processing.
139	00:11:39	00:11:40	Okay, I didn't say he processed her.
140	00:11:40	00:11:41	I just said he was here.
141	00:11:42	00:11:43	I appreciate the respect.
142	00:11:43	00:11:45	You sure about that?
143	00:11:45	00:11:46	Does she know about her father?
144	00:11:46	00:11:47	Not yet.
145	00:11:47	00:11:49	Well, I'd like to get started processing.
146	00:11:49	00:11:50	Can you show me who you found?
147	00:11:50	00:11:52	Okay, I found her right in here. And...
148	00:11:52	00:11:54	this is the young lady right over here.
149	00:11:58	00:12:00	Hi, Sasha.
150	00:12:00	00:12:02	I'm Catherine Willows.
151	00:12:02	00:12:04	And...
152	00:12:04	00:12:07	I need to ask you a few questions.
153	00:12:07	00:12:08	Okay?
154	00:12:11	00:12:12	My kit.
155	00:12:12	00:12:14	Did the man touch you?
156	00:12:14	00:12:16	He hit my mommy.
157	00:12:20	00:12:22	Did he hit you?
158	00:12:22	00:12:24	Did he hurt you in any way?
159	00:12:24	00:12:27	He acted like I wasn't there.
160	00:12:27	00:12:31	Well, you know what always happens to bad people?
161	00:12:31	00:12:36	They leave behind a part of themselves and that's how you can help us find your mommy.
162	00:12:36	00:12:40	Now, I need to look underneath your fingernails.
163	00:12:45	00:12:48	You want to show me what's in your hand?
164	00:12:49	00:12:51	It's okay.
165	00:12:58	00:13:00	Where did you get that?
166	00:13:01	00:13:04	Go! Run, Sasha, run!
167	00:13:06	00:13:09	I ran out after they drove off.
168	00:13:12	00:13:14	I picked that up.
169	00:13:14	00:13:16	I bet it felt cold when you picked it up.
170	00:13:16	00:13:19	No.
171	00:13:19	00:13:21	No... hot.
172	00:13:21	00:13:23	Hmm.
173	00:13:23	00:13:24	You're tricking me.
174	00:13:25	00:13:27	You're too smart for that.
175	00:13:31	00:13:35	rectangular firing pin impression breach face shear.
176	00:13:35	00:13:36	This casing's no Glock.
177	00:13:36	00:13:37	It's isn't your Chief's weapon.
178	00:13:37	00:13:39	Well, whoever this guy is, he's a lousy shot.
179	00:13:39	00:13:40	Five casings, no hits.
180	00:13:41	00:13:43	Oh, by the way, I'm Calleigh Duquesne.
181	00:13:43	00:13:45	Don't ask me how to spell it. Southern.
182	00:13:45	00:13:48	Catherine Willows. Southern... Nevada.
183	00:13:48	00:13:51	You got a theory on how the mother and daughter ended up all the way in Miami from Las Vegas?
184	00:13:52	00:13:53	Well, we don't actually work theories.
185	00:13:53	00:13:54	Do we, Warrick?
186	00:13:55	00:13:56	No, just evidence.
187	00:13:56	00:13:59	We're much more fanciful down here.
188	00:13:59	00:14:00	Aren't we, Horatio?
189	00:14:00	00:14:01	I think that's a fair description.
190	00:14:01	00:14:04	My guess is, this belongs to Taurus 9, made in Brazil.
191	00:14:04	00:14:10	It's a cheap Beretta knockoff and you may not see many of them in Vegas but we get them down here all the time.
192	00:14:10	00:14:13	Which makes me think this guy wasn't fleeing Las Vegas.
193	00:14:13	00:14:15	He was coming home to Miami.
194	00:14:16	00:14:18	Well, it's no longer Trunk Man.
195	00:14:18	00:14:20	Identified him from his dental records.
196	00:14:20	00:14:23	Jason Doyle. Dead for three days; no GSR.
197	00:14:24	00:14:26	So, I guess he didn't shoot Rittle.
198	00:14:26	00:14:28	We only recovered one slug from his cranium.
199	00:14:28	00:14:32	And I got this fragment from his lower back.
200	00:14:33	00:14:34	His lower back?
201	00:14:34	00:14:37	I thought he was shot twice in the head.
202	00:14:37	00:14:38	Vascular embolization.
203	00:14:38	00:14:40	Bullet got into his arterial system.
204	00:14:40	00:14:41	That's rare.
205	00:14:41	00:14:45	Well, it took a full-body x-ray for me to find the thing.
206	00:14:45	00:14:54	Bullet entered here fragmenting at the neck and losing velocity upon penetration of the carotid artery.
207	00:14:54	00:14:57	Tube down the aorta, continually losing momentum.
208	00:14:57	00:15:05	As it exited the aorta, it struck the vertebral column and then was swept down to the base of the aorta where I recovered it here at the lumbar region.
209	00:15:07	00:15:08	Pinball.
210	00:15:09	00:15:11	Looks like nines, like we found in the Chief.
211	00:15:11	00:15:13	I'll call Catherine. Thanks.
212	00:15:13	00:15:14	Yeah.
213	00:15:18	00:15:19	Hey, Nick...
214	00:15:19	00:15:20	Mm-hmm?
215	00:15:20	00:15:22	You ever been to a swingers' party?
216	00:15:23	00:15:26	Well, if it's the same thing as a frat party yeah, lots of them.
217	00:15:26	00:15:30	You know, you get enough booze going things can get pretty wild.
218	00:15:30	00:15:32	Frat party, huh?
219	00:15:32	00:15:35	I wouldn't know anything about that.
220	00:15:39	00:15:41	How wild?
221	00:15:42	00:15:44	Multiple-partner wild.
222	00:15:44	00:15:49	And it'd be no big deal to have two, maybe three girls at once, just...
223	00:15:51	00:15:54	Hit on the rock glass.
224	00:15:54	00:15:55	Work card.
225	00:15:55	00:15:57	Orpheus Hotel. Tiffany Langer.
226	00:15:57	00:15:59	Who's she?
227	00:15:59	00:16:00	Showgirl.
228	00:16:02	00:16:04	Yes, I went to the party.
229	00:16:04	00:16:05	No, I didn't go alone.
230	00:16:05	00:16:10	And no, I'm not telling you my date's name or anyone else who was there.
231	00:16:10	00:16:12	These people are important.
232	00:16:12	00:16:17	Well, a very important police officer was murdered there.
233	00:16:17	00:16:18	I don't care.
234	00:16:18	00:16:22	It took me a long time to get into the circle and I plan on staying there.
235	00:16:22	00:16:24	Was there anybody there you didn't know?
236	00:16:24	00:16:26	Anybody who wasn't in the circle?
237	00:16:26	00:16:28	Well, my date.
238	00:16:28	00:16:30	Do you know where he is?
239	00:16:30	00:16:32	I haven't seen him since that night.
240	00:16:32	00:16:35	He sent me home with a judge and his wife.
241	00:16:35	00:16:38	So... your date stayed at the party after you left?
242	00:16:38	00:16:40	As far as I know.
243	00:16:41	00:16:42	Where does he live?
244	00:16:42	00:16:43	I don't know.
245	00:16:43	00:16:44	I've known him for five days.
246	00:16:45	00:16:47	Well, that's 120 hours.
247	00:16:47	00:16:50	There must be something you know about him that you could share with us.
248	00:16:50	00:16:55	Right-handed, a Libra, circumcised, rich...
249	00:16:55	00:16:57	Back-East rich.
250	00:16:57	00:16:59	Which kind of surprised me because he wore really cheap cologne.
251	00:16:59	00:17:03	Cheap? How?
252	00:17:03	00:17:06	Smelled funny... sweet.
253	00:17:06	00:17:07	Are you sure it was cologne?
254	00:17:07	00:17:08	Or deodorant.
255	00:17:08	00:17:10	Mouthwash maybe.
256	00:17:10	00:17:12	All I know is it smelled sickly sweet.
257	00:17:12	00:17:17	To be honest I thought he could have used a little help in that department.
258	00:17:18	00:17:22	Would you happen to have an article of clothing of his by any chance?
259	00:17:22	00:17:24	The only thing he gave me was a good time.
260	00:17:24	00:17:25	Hey, guess what?
261	00:17:25	00:17:27	This isn't about you.
262	00:17:28	00:17:30	This is about a missing seven-year-old girl.
263	00:17:33	00:17:35	Why don't you give us his name.
264	00:17:37	00:17:41	Adam Van der Welk.
265	00:17:41	00:17:44	Uh, no, the Chief's little girl is with Child Services.
266	00:17:44	00:17:47	We're still at the drop-off place.
267	00:17:47	00:17:48	Yeah, right.
268	00:17:48	00:17:49	Will do, Brass.
269	00:17:49	00:17:50	I got a pill.
270	00:17:50	00:17:52	Looks like sedative.
271	00:17:56	00:17:58	Okay.
272	00:17:59	00:18:01	Diazapam.
273	00:18:01	00:18:02	Benzos...
274	00:18:02	00:18:05	That could explain why the mother didn't escape with her daughter.
275	00:18:05	00:18:06	She was incapacitated.
276	00:18:08	00:18:09	Go!
277	00:18:11	00:18:12	How'd the little girl get away?
278	00:18:12	00:18:15	We got some tire treads on the shoulder.
279	00:18:15	00:18:17	Made an easy stop.
280	00:18:17	00:18:20	And why did he pick such a secluded area?
281	00:18:20	00:18:22	Seems like a great place to ice someone.
282	00:18:22	00:18:24	Or take a leak.
283	00:18:24	00:18:27	Maybe that's why he stopped the car here... to take a leak.
284	00:18:30	00:18:32	Run! Run, Sash, run!
285	00:18:35	00:18:38	When you're home alone do you lock the bathroom door?
286	00:18:38	00:18:39	I don't even know you.
287	00:18:39	00:18:40	Sure you do.
288	00:18:40	00:18:41	We all do.
289	00:18:41	00:18:44	It's human nature to avoid being vulnerable, isn't it?
290	00:18:44	00:18:51	So, if that's the case then he would look for a tree to shield himself, wouldn't he?
291	00:18:51	00:18:58	So, then the question becomes how far along this path before he loses sight of them?
292	00:18:58	00:19:00	Not very far.
293	00:19:01	00:19:02	Look at this.
294	00:19:02	00:19:03	Bang. Footprints...
295	00:19:05	00:19:07	and this is urine.
296	00:19:11	00:19:14	If you're lucky urethral cells with slough off with urine.
297	00:19:15	00:19:20	But if we get his DNA there's a chance we'll get him.
298	00:19:21	00:19:23	Yeah. Caine.
299	00:19:23	00:19:24	What do you mean FBI?
300	00:19:29	00:19:31	So you're saying the guy has B.O.?
301	00:19:32	00:19:34	Body odor, bad breath.
302	00:19:34	00:19:37	I don't know; there's something about Adam Van der Welk that makes him smell.
303	00:19:37	00:19:41	All this because some showgirl said he smelled sweet?
304	00:19:41	00:19:42	Sickly sweet.
305	00:19:42	00:19:44	Smells can be like fingerprints, my dear.
306	00:19:44	00:19:46	Hey, what's going on there?
307	00:19:46	00:19:48	I thought you were meeting the Feds?
308	00:19:48	00:19:50	Uh, yeah, we are. They picked the place.
309	00:19:50	00:19:51	The Shore Club.
310	00:19:51	00:19:53	Later.
311	00:19:54	00:19:56	What's taking so long?
312	00:19:56	00:19:58	That is a good question.
313	00:20:00	00:20:02	Hey, I just ran into a Fed in the lobby.
314	00:20:03	00:20:10	He told me that apparently the Vegas case fits the profile of a serial the FBI's been tracking.
315	00:20:10	00:20:11	Hey, you're from Vegas?
316	00:20:11	00:20:12	Speedle. Brown.
317	00:20:12	00:20:14	Where was the Fed?
318	00:20:14	00:20:15	He's right there in the lobby.
319	00:20:15	00:20:18	He's got his little headphone on and his little tie.
320	00:20:18	00:20:19	And you talked to him?
321	00:20:19	00:20:20	Yeah.
322	00:20:20	00:20:22	Do they have an ID yet?
323	00:20:22	00:20:27	No ID yet, but their perp targets wealthy couples at their playgrounds...
324	00:20:27	00:20:31	Pebble Beach, Aspen, the Hamptons.
325	00:20:31	00:20:35	Evidently the husbands get murdered first and the wives later.
326	00:20:35	00:20:38	After they've enjoyed 48 hours of fun and games.
327	00:20:38	00:20:39	48?
328	00:20:39	00:20:41	Vegas?
329	00:20:41	00:20:42	Speedle. Willows.
330	00:20:44	00:20:45	That's it?
331	00:20:45	00:20:46	There's also a link to Miami.
332	00:20:46	00:20:48	Of course there is.
333	00:20:48	00:20:52	Or, you know, he could just be some geriatric dude that just digs the weather.
334	00:20:52	00:20:54	I don't understand.
335	00:20:54	00:20:56	Why didn't the Feds put this out on NCIC?
336	00:20:56	00:20:57	Because they're Feds.
337	00:20:57	00:20:59	Excuse me.
338	00:21:00	00:21:04	Dennis... Dennis...
339	00:21:04	00:21:05	Tick-tock, Dennis.
340	00:21:05	00:21:09	While you're waiting to get your ducks in a row the guy with the Miami link just slipped through my hands.
341	00:21:09	00:21:11	Horatio, I didn't have Federal approval...
342	00:21:11	00:21:13	I need answers for this little girl.
343	00:21:13	00:21:15	Her father's just been killed, maybe her mother, too.
344	00:21:15	00:21:17	And that's your fault.
345	00:21:17	00:21:18	You understand that.
346	00:21:18	00:21:20	It sounds like you're making this personal.
347	00:21:20	00:21:25	Dennis, you don't give me this link I will make this very personal.
348	00:21:27	00:21:30	All of his victims stayed here in the last year.
349	00:21:31	00:21:32	Here? This hotel?
350	00:21:32	00:21:35	Rittle and his wife, too. Last winter.
351	00:21:35	00:21:36	Mm, I wish I would have known that.
352	00:21:36	00:21:38	Maybe they'd still be alive.
353	00:21:38	00:21:39	Yeah?
354	00:21:45	00:21:48	Si... Vamos.
355	00:21:48	00:21:51	I had a bad feeling about this.
356	00:21:51	00:21:52	What'd she just say to you?
357	00:21:52	00:21:54	She just said that you need to learn the language.
358	00:22:00	00:22:01	I don't see this burgundy car.
359	00:22:01	00:22:02	Where are you looking?
360	00:22:03	00:22:06	Check the disturbance along the bank and follow it in.
361	00:22:06	00:22:08	How did you find the disturbance?
362	00:22:08	00:22:09	Drive up and down the canals all day?
363	00:22:09	00:22:13	No, the thing about Miami is the entire city's watched from above.
364	00:22:13	00:22:15	Coast Guard choppers.
365	00:22:15	00:22:16	Someone going to cover me?
366	00:22:16	00:22:17	I got you.
367	00:22:18	00:22:21	Cover you for what?
368	00:22:21	00:22:22	Alligators.
369	00:22:24	00:22:28	Only way to outrun a gator is to swim faster than the guy next to you.
370	00:22:28	00:22:30	Isn't that right, Delko?
371	00:22:30	00:22:32	Used to have a partner.
372	00:22:32	00:22:33	Guys...
373	00:22:33	00:22:34	please?
374	00:23:32	00:23:33	That her?
375	00:23:34	00:23:36	Yeah, that's Mina Rittle.
376	00:23:53	00:23:55	Our guy's still in the wind, folks.
377	00:23:55	00:23:59	Still in the wind.
378	00:24:06	00:24:07	What's her name?
379	00:24:07	00:24:08	Mina Rittle.
380	00:24:09	00:24:11	Who wrapped you, Mina?
381	00:24:13	00:24:15	The plastic wasn't for transport.
382	00:24:15	00:24:18	Covering her intimates-- most likely sexual.
383	00:24:18	00:24:20	Two gunshot wounds left temple.
384	00:24:20	00:24:22	One shot was a through-and-through.
385	00:24:23	00:24:25	Trace ASAP, along with the plastic.
386	00:24:26	00:24:34	My preliminary probe shows water in the lungs which indicates she was still alive when she was put in the canal.
387	00:24:36	00:24:40	Looks like the eyes are glued shut.
388	00:24:40	00:24:44	Gold crusty substance underneath.
389	00:24:44	00:24:46	What is that, Mina?
390	00:24:53	00:24:56	The substance is water-soluble.
391	00:24:56	00:24:58	But somehow it got preserved in the water.
392	00:24:58	00:25:03	My guess is the plastic was wrapped around her eyes at some point.
393	00:25:03	00:25:05	Wait a minute.
394	00:25:07	00:25:09	There's a lot more of it.
395	00:25:11	00:25:15	What do you want to bet this is in every orifice?
396	00:25:19	00:25:21	You guys got a sick one.
397	00:25:37	00:25:39	Aha!
398	00:25:39	00:25:42	Delko, you've been down there for 45 minutes.
399	00:25:42	00:25:44	Do you know the level of bacteria in the water?
400	00:25:44	00:25:45	You can get all kinds of infections.
401	00:25:45	00:25:46	What do you got?
402	00:25:46	00:25:48	Water pistol.
403	00:25:48	00:25:51	One water-logged Beretta knock-off.
404	00:25:51	00:25:53	Suspect's personal gun?
405	00:25:53	00:25:55	That's it. Congratulations.
406	00:25:55	00:25:59	I'll put it over the wires that he's not carrying that Taurus anymore.
407	00:25:59	00:26:01	Do that, and take a shower.
408	00:26:01	00:26:02	Nice shoes.
409	00:26:04	00:26:07	Ma'am, you have to concentrate on the face.
410	00:26:07	00:26:09	In parts, not just the whole.
411	00:26:09	00:26:11	Ask me what he wore.
412	00:26:11	00:26:13	Ask me if he was good in bed.
413	00:26:13	00:26:15	Just don't ask me how close together his eyes were.
414	00:26:15	00:26:17	You said he kind of looked like Ricky Martin, right?
415	00:26:17	00:26:19	Yeah, with a touch of Jude Law.
416	00:26:19	00:26:22	Try to not just picture him.
417	00:26:22	00:26:24	Try to think of an event.
418	00:26:25	00:26:27	Okay...
419	00:26:27	00:26:29	Three-way kiss.
420	00:26:29	00:26:31	His lower lip was kind of pouty...
421	00:26:31	00:26:39	and he had this Michael Douglas thing working, you know--- a cleft in his chin.
422	00:26:39	00:26:40	Kind of like that?
423	00:26:40	00:26:41	Yeah.
424	00:26:41	00:26:45	You're right. That is easier.
425	00:27:04	00:27:06	Adam Van der Welk.
426	00:27:06	00:27:08	Little girl saw a monster.
427	00:27:08	00:27:10	Showgirl saw a husband.
428	00:27:10	00:27:12	So this guy could be anybody.
429	00:27:12	00:27:15	Yeah, that's the problem with eyewitnesses.
430	00:27:15	00:27:17	All the more reason to rely on evidence.
431	00:27:17	00:27:19	Tell Warrick hey. Let me know if anything breaks.
432	00:27:19	00:27:20	You, too.
433	00:27:20	00:27:21	Hey.
434	00:27:21	00:27:22	Hey.
435	00:27:22	00:27:25	So, how's your colleague Grissom doing on the aroma angle?
436	00:27:25	00:27:30	I'm sure he's making progress but Grissom rarely says anything until he's good and ready.
437	00:27:30	00:27:31	Smart man.
438	00:27:31	00:27:33	I just wanted to show you something.
439	00:27:33	00:27:36	The sticky substance we got off the wife is, in fact, honey.
440	00:27:36	00:27:38	You say that like it means something.
441	00:27:38	00:27:44	Well, honey on its own is just honey but when you add plastic wrap, it's... a different situation.
442	00:27:56	00:27:59	( crowd chanting ) Five... four... three...
443	00:27:59	00:28:02	...two... one...
444	00:28:24	00:28:26	Yum.
445	00:28:26	00:28:29	This is where he got the idea.
446	00:28:29	00:28:31	Yep. This is Hives.
447	00:28:31	00:28:32	Wish me luck.
448	00:28:36	00:28:37	Excuse me.
449	00:28:37	00:28:39	Excuse me.
450	00:28:39	00:28:41	Hi.
451	00:28:41	00:28:43	Some guys like to lick it off.
452	00:28:43	00:28:46	Really? I'm partial to the swab myself.
453	00:28:48	00:28:49	Ready, honey?
454	00:28:49	00:28:51	Coming, dear.
455	00:28:54	00:28:59	Tuberculosis victims emit breath that smells like wet leaves.
456	00:28:59	00:29:01	Maple, elm, ash, what?
457	00:29:01	00:29:02	I'm not sure.
458	00:29:02	00:29:08	Miami is pulling cars out of canals-- chasing leads, debriefing the kid-- and you guys are flipping through textbooks?
459	00:29:08	00:29:10	This is how I work.
460	00:29:10	00:29:12	Tuberculosis.
461	00:29:12	00:29:14	Cyanide Poisoning.
462	00:29:14	00:29:16	Endocrinology.
463	00:29:16	00:29:18	I'm following my nosino.
464	00:29:18	00:29:23	You're closer to this Van der Welk guy than you're letting on aren't you?
465	00:29:23	00:29:26	Doctor...
466	00:29:26	00:29:27	Doctor.
467	00:29:28	00:29:29	How about Darier disease?
468	00:29:29	00:29:33	Doesn't that give you a rash that smells like human excrement?
469	00:29:33	00:29:36	We're looking for something a little sweeter.
470	00:29:36	00:29:39	There's diabetic ketoacidosis.
471	00:29:39	00:29:42	Body has excess glucose which converts to ketone...
472	00:29:42	00:29:45	gets expelled through the pores.
473	00:29:45	00:29:47	Has a fruity smell.
474	00:29:47	00:29:50	It would help if we had a piece of the assailant's clothing.
475	00:29:54	00:29:55	What?
476	00:29:55	00:29:57	I think I overlooked some evidence.
477	00:30:00	00:30:06	I'm going to isolate it using high-performance liquid chromatography.
478	00:30:06	00:30:10	Once we identify the pollen we'll know if it's floral honey.
479	00:30:17	00:30:20	So, H, when's the last time you were in Hives?
480	00:30:20	00:30:22	I was there opening night.
481	00:30:22	00:30:24	I didn't see you there.
482	00:30:24	00:30:25	I was, uh...
483	00:30:25	00:30:26	VIP.
484	00:30:29	00:30:32	What is this?
485	00:30:32	00:30:33	It's Tupelo honey.
486	00:30:33	00:30:35	It's the purest of all honeys.
487	00:30:35	00:30:36	Stays in liquid form for life.
488	00:30:36	00:30:38	Doesn't crystallize or harden.
489	00:30:38	00:30:39	Where'd you get that?
490	00:30:39	00:30:42	CDC hipped me to it after that Africanized bee problem.
491	00:30:42	00:30:44	Okay, let's swap this out.
492	00:30:44	00:30:47	I want you to take a look at this.
493	00:30:48	00:30:51	We got this off the Chief's wife.
494	00:30:56	00:30:58	It's a match.
495	00:30:59	00:31:01	It's a match.
496	00:31:01	00:31:03	$500 for five dollars worth of honey?
497	00:31:03	00:31:04	I don't think it's worth it.
498	00:31:04	00:31:10	Those are mostly for decoration but once in a while some bigwig comes takes one of them out of here.
499	00:31:10	00:31:11	Wouldn't it have been easier to put these in order?
500	00:31:11	00:31:12	This is going to take forever.
501	00:31:12	00:31:15	Maybe not. I've got a receipt from just two nights ago.
502	00:31:15	00:31:16	Let me see that.
503	00:31:19	00:31:21	Do you recognize this guy?
504	00:31:21	00:31:24	Yeah, looks just like every other Joe that comes in here.
505	00:31:24	00:31:25	Look, you work the door.
506	00:31:26	00:31:32	Anybody come in here in the last 48 hours that bought some of that very expensive Tupelo honey This is Miami.
507	00:31:32	00:31:34	Every night's a weekend.
508	00:31:34	00:31:37	My people tell me that a customer came in here two nights ago to buy some.
509	00:31:37	00:31:39	Wasn't a customer. It was a limo driver.
510	00:31:39	00:31:40	A limo driver?
511	00:31:40	00:31:41	Yeah, Gordon.
512	00:31:41	00:31:42	Gave me a C-note just to double park.
513	00:31:43	00:31:45	Did this Gordon tell you who he had in back of his car?
514	00:31:45	00:31:46	No.
515	00:31:46	00:31:49	Just that it was some rich guy-- some high roller.
516	00:31:49	00:31:52	Let me guess-- from Vegas.
517	00:31:52	00:31:53	Yeah.
518	00:32:05	00:32:06	How'd you find him?
519	00:32:06	00:32:09	Figured, limo driver-- airport.
520	00:32:09	00:32:14	I spotted Gordon here on Alton-- back way to Miami International.
521	00:32:14	00:32:17	Lit him up, pulled him over here.
522	00:32:17	00:32:18	Nice work.
523	00:32:18	00:32:20	You got a last name, Gordon?
524	00:32:20	00:32:21	Daimler.
525	00:32:21	00:32:24	Look, Officer, the Corwins are coming in on their own private jet.
526	00:32:24	00:32:26	They're two of my best customers.
527	00:32:26	00:32:27	I really should be there.
528	00:32:27	00:32:30	Well, the Corwins are going to have to wait.
529	00:32:30	00:32:36	We understand that another one of your customers bought some very expensive honey from a club.
530	00:32:36	00:32:38	Yeah, well, I've had stranger requests.
531	00:32:38	00:32:41	This customer of yours have a name?
532	00:32:41	00:32:42	Never got it. He paid cash.
533	00:32:42	00:32:43	Never saw a credit card.
534	00:32:43	00:32:46	Well, did you notice anything unusual about him?
535	00:32:47	00:32:49	Did he smell?
536	00:32:49	00:32:50	Did he...
537	00:32:50	00:32:51	have an odor?
538	00:32:51	00:32:53	Uh, his breath maybe.
539	00:32:53	00:32:54	He'd been drinking a lot.
540	00:32:55	00:32:56	Remember what he was drinking?
541	00:32:56	00:32:57	Was it sweet like Irish whiskey?
542	00:32:57	00:32:58	Whatever I have stocked.
543	00:32:59	00:33:00	Well, we'd like to take a look.
544	00:33:00	00:33:01	Sure. Go ahead.
545	00:33:31	00:33:32	Gin.
546	00:33:44	00:33:46	Hmm.
547	00:33:50	00:33:52	Smell that?
548	00:33:52	00:33:53	Sickly sweet.
549	00:33:53	00:33:57	That's exactly how Grissom described it.
550	00:34:02	00:34:04	You want me to do what?
551	00:34:04	00:34:06	Smell this.
552	00:34:15	00:34:16	That's it.
553	00:34:16	00:34:18	That's Adam's smell.
554	00:34:18	00:34:22	In the five days that you two were together did you happen to notice what he was drinking?
555	00:34:22	00:34:24	Champagne.
556	00:34:24	00:34:27	Did he ever drink anything sweeter like whiskey or cognac?
557	00:34:27	00:34:29	Are you kidding me?
558	00:34:29	00:34:32	With him it was all Dom all the time.
559	00:34:34	00:34:36	You found a medical condition.
560	00:34:36	00:34:40	Diabetic ketoacidosis-- it's an insulin deficiency.
561	00:34:40	00:34:43	His body's been expelling excess glucose.
562	00:34:43	00:34:44	Makes him smell fruity.
563	00:34:44	00:34:48	Which I guess could easily be mistaken for whiskey breath.
564	00:34:48	00:34:54	Hey, can you test for diabetic ketoacidosis off urine?
565	00:34:54	00:34:57	Well, blood's the best but if you had a urine sample, maybe.
566	00:34:57	00:35:01	Ask him what medication you would take for that.
567	00:35:01	00:35:03	What would a doctor prescribe?
568	00:35:03	00:35:05	Novalin insulin.
569	00:35:08	00:35:10	Lucky for us we found blood in his urine.
570	00:35:10	00:35:12	Absence of C-Peptide in the blood.
571	00:35:12	00:35:16	Means the insulin in our guy's system isn't natural-- it's synthetic.
572	00:35:16	00:35:17	And prescribed.
573	00:35:17	00:35:19	We're right over here. This is our database.
574	00:35:22	00:35:29	Okay, what we're looking for is a patient who's purchased synthetic insulin in the last 48 hours.
575	00:35:34	00:35:37	Here we go.
576	00:35:43	00:35:44	Gordon Daimler.
577	00:35:44	00:35:46	That's the limo driver.
578	00:35:46	00:35:48	That's him.
579	00:35:48	00:35:54	And the reason that old Gordon probably didn't smell when we picked him up is because he'd just taken his insulin, hadn't he?
580	00:35:54	00:35:58	But the scent was still in the limo's AC system.
581	00:35:58	00:36:00	Well, now we have this guy's address.
582	00:36:00	00:36:01	Yes, take a look at this address.
583	00:36:01	00:36:05	A limousine driver with a house on the water in Coconut Grove?
584	00:36:06	00:36:07	I don't think so.
585	00:36:07	00:36:10	Who's the owner of record?
586	00:36:10	00:36:12	Let's check it.
587	00:36:15	00:36:16	Sissy and Dylan Corwin.
588	00:36:20	00:36:23	That's the couple he was picking up at the airport when we pulled him over.
589	00:36:23	00:36:24	That's right.
590	00:36:24	00:36:28	So then maybe that's how he finds his victims-- driving a limo.
591	00:36:29	00:36:35	And when they're away at some posh resort he moves into their house, doesn't he?
592	00:36:35	00:36:38	Hops over to Las Vegas.
593	00:36:38	00:36:40	Visits the couple he met in Miami.
594	00:36:40	00:36:41	Kills the husband... Mm-hmm.
595	00:36:41	00:36:44	...brings the wife back here-- kills her.
596	00:36:44	00:36:45	And when the Corwins come home...
597	00:36:47	00:36:48	not good.
598	00:37:01	00:37:03	No one's answering inside.
599	00:37:08	00:37:10	Miami-Dade Police!
600	00:37:43	00:37:44	Slowly.
601	00:37:46	00:37:47	Slowly.
602	00:38:06	00:38:08	I got a blood trail here.
603	00:38:08	00:38:10	Leading to the garage.
604	00:38:52	00:38:55	He dragged the body to here...
605	00:38:55	00:38:57	Put her in that car.
606	00:38:57	00:38:58	Nine-mil.
607	00:39:02	00:39:04	One shot's a through-and-through.
608	00:39:04	00:39:05	Scalp hair.
609	00:39:07	00:39:09	He fired this one first.
610	00:39:09	00:39:10	I don't know.
611	00:39:10	00:39:12	To terrorize her.
612	00:39:12	00:39:14	This strike here.
613	00:39:14	00:39:16	That one's all business.
614	00:39:43	00:39:46	He wrapped her in plastic by the bed raped her.
615	00:39:46	00:39:50	Then dragged her in here and cornered her like an animal.
616	00:39:50	00:39:53	If Gordon's true to form he's going to kill the Corwins.
617	00:39:54	00:39:56	You guys should take a look at this.
618	00:39:57	00:40:01	Well, people don't really buy these houses for the view.
619	00:40:01	00:40:04	It's a place to put a million-dollar boat.
620	00:40:04	00:40:05	But what's your point?
621	00:40:08	00:40:13	The boat's missing and that's where he's killing them right now.
622	00:40:13	00:40:14	Speed, get on that thing right now.
623	00:40:14	00:40:17	Put the birds in the air and call the Coast Guard.
624	00:40:17	00:40:18	Right now. Do it.
625	00:40:18	00:40:19	Air and Sea, this is Tim Speedle.
626	00:40:19	00:40:22	I need you to be on the lookout for a yacht, T-45.
627	00:40:22	00:40:24	R.O. Dylan and Sissy Corwin.
628	00:40:24	00:40:26	Commandeered by one Gordon Daimler.
629	00:40:26	00:40:27	Gordon Daimler.
630	00:40:27	00:40:29	Commandeered by...
631	00:40:29	00:40:30	Gordon Daimler.
632	00:40:36	00:40:38	Coast Guard found her adrift!
633	00:40:38	00:40:39	No radio contact!
634	00:40:41	00:40:42	We hailed her.
635	00:40:42	00:40:43	No response.
636	00:40:44	00:40:45	Infrared's up.
637	00:40:45	00:40:46	Blue means dead, red means alive.
638	00:40:47	00:40:48	Pink.
639	00:40:48	00:40:50	Body heat's fading. Person's dying.
640	00:40:50	00:40:51	Identify the other players.
641	00:40:51	00:40:52	Speed?
642	00:40:52	00:40:55	Red. Is that our suspect?
643	00:40:55	00:40:56	I'm not sure.
644	00:40:56	00:40:57	I am.
645	00:40:57	00:40:58	How?
646	00:40:58	00:41:00	We haven't identified all the players.
647	00:41:00	00:41:02	He's going back to finish off the job. Detweiler.
648	00:41:02	00:41:04	Getting a bead on him, sir.
649	00:41:04	00:41:08	The M.O. on this guy says husband's already dead.
650	00:41:08	00:41:10	He's going back to finish off the wife.
651	00:41:10	00:41:11	You're good to go.
652	00:41:11	00:41:14	Body language does not look like an attack.
653	00:41:21	00:41:22	Wait a minute, wait a minute.
654	00:41:22	00:41:24	Don't the Corwins have a jet?
655	00:41:24	00:41:25	The Corwins have a jet!
656	00:41:25	00:41:26	That's where Daimler is.
657	00:41:26	00:41:28	It's the Corwins in there.
658	00:41:28	00:41:30	Abort this, Sackheim! Abort this!
659	00:41:30	00:41:32	Interstate case, not your call! Proceed!
660	00:41:32	00:41:34	Stand down!
661	00:41:34	00:41:35	Take him out!
662	00:41:37	00:41:41	Detweiler, I know you want to impress your boss but there's an innocent man on that boat.
663	00:41:41	00:41:45	Now, if you take this shot I'm going to be in your grille for the rest of your natural life.
664	00:41:45	00:41:48	I want you to think about what that might be like.
665	00:41:50	00:41:51	Think about that.
666	00:41:58	00:42:01	Thank you. Speed, the Corwins have a jet.
667	00:42:01	00:42:02	Find the jet.
668	00:42:02	00:42:07	Call the FAA and ground the jet by authority of Miami-Dade County.
669	00:42:07	00:42:08	You got it, H.
670	00:42:08	00:42:09	Give us 30 seconds.
671	00:42:10	00:42:11	Then send backup!
672	00:42:17	00:42:18	Mr. Corwin!
673	00:42:18	00:42:22	I tried to save her.
674	00:42:22	00:42:24	It's too late.
675	00:42:24	00:42:25	I'm sorry.
676	00:42:29	00:42:31	Get me Fire Rescue.
677	00:42:36	00:42:39	Few more minutes, sir. We'll be on the way to Monaco.
678	00:42:48	00:42:49	Good evening.
679	00:42:50	00:42:53	Mr. Van der Welk.
680	00:42:53	00:42:55	Gordon, drive your limo here?
681	00:42:58	00:42:59	He's clean.
682	00:42:59	00:43:01	The Corwins...
683	00:43:01	00:43:02	are my friends.
684	00:43:02	00:43:03	They lent me this plane.
685	00:43:03	00:43:05	Like the lent you their boat?
686	00:43:05	00:43:07	Speak to the pilot.
687	00:43:07	00:43:09	Dylan Corwin called him personally.
688	00:43:09	00:43:11	Directed him to fly me to Monaco.
689	00:43:11	00:43:15	I'd rather call Dylan at the hospital to confirm.
690	00:43:15	00:43:17	The husband didn't die.
691	00:43:17	00:43:23	He left us a witness and enough evidence to convict you in two states.
692	00:43:23	00:43:25	Rich men don't go to jail.
693	00:43:25	00:43:27	You're not rich, Gordon.
694	00:43:36	00:43:37	I'm going to, uh...
695	00:43:37	00:43:38	I'm going to book this guy.
696	00:43:38	00:43:39	You want to go with?
697	00:43:39	00:43:41	Nah, you got it.
698	00:43:41	00:43:43	I'll have my DA call your DA.
699	00:43:45	00:43:47	Sounds good.
700	00:43:47	00:43:48	Sounds good.
701	00:43:48	00:43:51	Uh... Thank you for your help on this.
702	00:43:51	00:43:53	Thanks for yours, actually.
703	00:43:53	00:43:56	Right.
704	00:43:57	00:43:59	You take care of yourself.
705	00:43:59	00:44:01	I always do.
706	00:44:19	00:44:20	Hey.
707	00:44:27	00:44:29	My mommy and daddy are dead, aren't they?
708	00:44:33	00:44:37	Well, your aunt is flying in to talk to you.
709	00:44:37	00:44:40	That's a yes.
710	00:44:42	00:44:44	I lost someone once.
711	00:44:44	00:44:47	Who?
712	00:44:47	00:44:50	Well...
713	00:44:51	00:44:53	Did you feel sick?
714	00:44:53	00:44:54	Still do.
715	00:44:54	00:44:56	Still do.
716	00:44:58	00:45:00	Sasha.
717	00:45:00	00:45:09	People are going to say a lot of things about your mom and dad and some of them are going to be true but what I want you to remember is that they fought like heroes for you.
718	00:45:09	00:45:12	Will you remember that for me?
719	00:45:15	00:45:16	Good.
720	00:45:16	00:45:18	Good for you.
721	00:45:28	00:45:30	Hello.
722	00:45:31	00:45:32	Hey.
723	00:45:34	00:45:36	Nice tan.
724	00:45:36	00:45:38	Nice suit.
725	00:45:38	00:45:43	Yeah, well, I knew you were coming back today, so I dressed up.
726	00:45:43	00:45:44	Yeah.
727	00:45:44	00:45:45	Right.
728	00:45:45	00:45:48	Really.
729	00:45:50	00:45:51	What?
730	00:45:51	00:45:53	Nothing.
731	00:45:53	00:45:57	It's just... unusual to see you dressed like that.
732	00:45:57	00:46:00	I had to go to the Chief's funeral.
733	00:46:00	00:46:02	Missed me that much, huh?
