0,00:00:46,00:00:49,We should have these parties more than once a month.
1,00:00:49,00:00:51,"I would, but Mina tends to get jealous."
2,00:00:51,00:00:56,"I love you, Chief but if anybody should be jealous, it's you."
3,00:00:56,00:00:58,(laughs)
4,00:00:59,00:01:01,Who's that guy?
5,00:01:01,00:01:01,"Hey, Chief..."
6,00:01:01,00:01:03,I didn't know you were into guys.
7,00:01:04,00:01:05,What guy?
8,00:01:44,00:01:46,(two gunshots)
9,00:01:51,00:01:53,Daddy?
10,00:02:15,00:02:18,So two nights ago he has a party.
11,00:02:18,00:02:20,"High-end guest list, very private."
12,00:02:20,00:02:22,That was the last anyone saw of him.
13,00:02:22,00:02:26,Housekeeper arrives 20 minutes ago.
14,00:02:26,00:02:27,This is what she found.
15,00:02:37,00:02:39,Ex-Chief of Detectives.
16,00:02:39,00:02:41,Left to make the big bucks.
17,00:02:41,00:02:48,Consultant with security at every major casino in town and couldn't even protect himself.
18,00:02:48,00:02:58,"There's only one interpretation for this: ""Kill the pig."" And what about the rest of his family?"
19,00:02:58,00:03:00,No sign of the wife.
20,00:03:00,00:03:01,What about the daughter?
21,00:03:01,00:03:04,Housekeeper assumed that she spent the weekend with the grandmother.
22,00:03:04,00:03:06,Assumed?
23,00:03:28,00:03:30,She's gone.
24,00:04:03,00:04:05,His wife and daughter are missing.
25,00:04:05,00:04:08,His silver Cadillac DTS is also missing.
26,00:04:08,00:04:11,We're looking for any signs of forced entry in the house.
27,00:04:11,00:04:15,Any signs of ransack that's not associated with the party. Okay.
28,00:04:15,00:04:16,We need serious damage control.
29,00:04:16,00:04:19,When the media gets a hold of it it's going to be bad for morale all around.
30,00:04:19,00:04:20,Watch your step.
31,00:04:20,00:04:21,I'll take the downstairs.
32,00:04:21,00:04:23,"Yeah, I'll be above you."
33,00:04:23,00:04:25,Looks execution-style.
34,00:04:25,00:04:27,At least one shot to the back of the head.
35,00:04:27,00:04:30,A lot of bruising around these handcuffs.
36,00:04:30,00:04:32,So he probably fought back.
37,00:04:32,00:04:34,Without a doubt.
38,00:04:34,00:04:36,Found a shell casing.
39,00:04:37,00:04:41,Looks like one of ours.
40,00:04:41,00:04:45,Nine-millimeter. Standard issue.
41,00:04:45,00:04:48,So where do you suppose the Chief keeps his gun safe?
42,00:04:48,00:04:50,(drilling)
43,00:05:10,00:05:11,We're in.
44,00:05:15,00:05:17,"Thank you, Scott."
45,00:05:18,00:05:21,What do you got?
46,00:05:24,00:05:27,.38.
47,00:05:28,00:05:29,Nice.
48,00:05:29,00:05:32,Pearl handle .25.
49,00:05:32,00:05:33,Clear?
50,00:05:33,00:05:34,Still looking for that .9.
51,00:05:44,00:05:48,So you think the Chief might've kept his signature piece someplace else?
52,00:05:48,00:05:56,"""For 25 years of distinguished service."" An honor like that. Keep it in the case."
53,00:05:56,00:05:58,Yeah.
54,00:05:58,00:06:00,So I'm thinking that the wife might be in on this.
55,00:06:00,00:06:01,Why didn't she plan better?
56,00:06:01,00:06:03,Pack the kid's clothes. What?
57,00:06:03,00:06:06,The nanny told me that she only took one shirt-- one the kid wouldn't even wear.
58,00:06:07,00:06:08,Security guard.
59,00:06:08,00:06:12,No party list but he did see each car that left the night of the party and morning.
60,00:06:12,00:06:15,Chief Rittle left around 5:00 a.m.
61,00:06:16,00:06:18,5:14 to be exact.
62,00:06:22,00:06:24,You saw Chief Rittle leave?
63,00:06:24,00:06:25,"Yeah, he was with his wife and kid."
64,00:06:25,00:06:29,And he had his baseball cap and sunglasses on like always does.
65,00:06:29,00:06:32,So you saw a baseball cap and sunglasses. (cell phone rings)
66,00:06:32,00:06:34,Did you actually see the Chief's face?
67,00:06:34,00:06:36,Grissom. Well...
68,00:06:36,00:06:37,"Actually, I didn't."
69,00:06:37,00:06:40,Brass found the Chief's Cadillac.
70,00:06:40,00:06:42,Who found it?
71,00:06:42,00:06:44,In-house security. Blue jacket.
72,00:06:44,00:06:46,First time he saw the car was Saturday.
73,00:06:46,00:06:48,Chalked the tires twice.
74,00:06:48,00:06:51,Saw the bulletin on the Chief and called us.
75,00:06:51,00:06:52,"Any bodies, Joe?"
76,00:06:52,00:06:54,I already checked inside the car.
77,00:06:55,00:06:57,We're waiting on you to check the trunk.
78,00:07:00,00:07:02,(cell phone rings)
79,00:07:02,00:07:03,Whoa.
80,00:07:03,00:07:05,Excuse me.
81,00:07:05,00:07:07,Who is this?
82,00:07:15,00:07:16,"""Chief Rittle""?"
83,00:07:16,00:07:19,What is his connection to the Chief?
84,00:07:19,00:07:20,I don't know.
85,00:07:20,00:07:24,But if he has gunpowder residue on him could be our shooter.
86,00:07:24,00:07:26,Okay.
87,00:07:26,00:07:29,Florida Highway Patrol called.
88,00:07:29,00:07:35,Several motorists saw a girl matching Sasha's exact physical description walking along an access road.
89,00:07:35,00:07:36,In Florida?
90,00:07:36,00:07:37,Miami-Dade County.
91,00:07:37,00:07:39,Chief was shot Friday night.
92,00:07:39,00:07:41,It's a two-day drive if you don't stop.
93,00:07:41,00:07:44,It's national news with national attention.
94,00:07:44,00:07:46,I'm not surprised we're getting call-ins.
95,00:07:46,00:07:50,"Well, if it is our little girl she's got evidence on her from two Vegas homicides."
96,00:07:50,00:07:54,One of us should be down there to process.
97,00:07:58,00:08:00,Take Warrick. I don't think he's ever been to Florida.
98,00:08:06,00:08:10,(sirens blaring)
99,00:08:10,00:08:12,She's seven years old!
100,00:08:12,00:08:14,She's wearing a pink shirt!
101,00:08:14,00:08:17,She was last seen by a motorist there!
102,00:08:17,00:08:20,She can be two kilometers in either direction.
103,00:08:20,00:08:23,Think of this area as a quadrant. Divide up.
104,00:08:23,00:08:24,"You, north. Got it!"
105,00:08:24,00:08:26,"You, south."
106,00:08:26,00:08:27,"All right, this way."
107,00:08:27,00:08:28,Let's go. (truck horn blows)
108,00:08:28,00:08:30,(horn blowing)
109,00:08:30,00:08:31,Clear out!
110,00:08:31,00:08:32,Watch your back!
111,00:09:03,00:09:03,(squeals)
112,00:09:07,00:09:09,(squealing)
113,00:09:48,00:09:49,Sasha?
114,00:09:53,00:09:55,Sasha.
115,00:09:57,00:09:58,My name is Horatio Caine.
116,00:09:58,00:10:00,I'm the head of the Crime Unit.
117,00:10:01,00:10:02,Horatio?
118,00:10:02,00:10:03,Yeah.
119,00:10:03,00:10:05,"That's a funny name, isn't it?"
120,00:10:05,00:10:10,My mother named me after a famous writer named Horatio Alger.
121,00:10:10,00:10:11,Ever hear of him?
122,00:10:11,00:10:13,Is your badge real?
123,00:10:13,00:10:15,Yeah.
124,00:10:15,00:10:17,"Yeah, that's real."
125,00:10:21,00:10:23,My daddy's a policeman.
126,00:10:23,00:10:26,I know that.
127,00:10:26,00:10:27,I knew that.
128,00:10:29,00:10:32,"They're looking for me, you know."
129,00:10:32,00:10:36,"Me, too. Me, too."
130,00:10:36,00:10:40,What do you say we sit here and get found together?
131,00:10:51,00:10:52,What a day.
132,00:10:58,00:11:01,(helicopter whirring)
133,00:11:01,00:11:03,Burgundy sedan. Caucasian female.
134,00:11:03,00:11:07,Age 32. Traveling with a Caucasian male indeterminate age.
135,00:11:07,00:11:08,I got a female in distress.
136,00:11:08,00:11:11,I want the APB to extend the whole state.
137,00:11:11,00:11:12,"Panhandle to the Keys, yes, sir."
138,00:11:12,00:11:13,Good.
139,00:11:28,00:11:30,Horatio Caine.
140,00:11:30,00:11:31,Catherine Willows.
141,00:11:31,00:11:32,Caine. Brown.
142,00:11:32,00:11:34,Child Services has sent a doctor out.
143,00:11:34,00:11:35,"All right, let's just be clear."
144,00:11:35,00:11:36,This is a Las Vegas case.
145,00:11:37,00:11:39,This is our victim and we do the processing.
146,00:11:39,00:11:40,"Okay, I didn't say he processed her."
147,00:11:40,00:11:41,I just said he was here.
148,00:11:42,00:11:43,I appreciate the respect.
149,00:11:43,00:11:45,You sure about that?
150,00:11:45,00:11:46,Does she know about her father?
151,00:11:46,00:11:47,Not yet.
152,00:11:47,00:11:49,"Well, I'd like to get started processing."
153,00:11:49,00:11:50,Can you show me who you found?
154,00:11:50,00:11:52,"Okay, I found her right in here. And..."
155,00:11:52,00:11:54,this is the young lady right over here.
156,00:11:58,00:12:00,"Hi, Sasha."
157,00:12:00,00:12:02,I'm Catherine Willows.
158,00:12:02,00:12:04,And...
159,00:12:04,00:12:07,I need to ask you a few questions.
160,00:12:07,00:12:08,Okay?
161,00:12:11,00:12:12,My kit.
162,00:12:12,00:12:14,Did the man touch you?
163,00:12:14,00:12:16,He hit my mommy.
164,00:12:20,00:12:22,Did he hit you?
165,00:12:22,00:12:24,Did he hurt you in any way?
166,00:12:24,00:12:27,He acted like I wasn't there.
167,00:12:27,00:12:31,"Well, you know what always happens to bad people?"
168,00:12:31,00:12:36,They leave behind a part of themselves and that's how you can help us find your mommy.
169,00:12:36,00:12:40,"Now, I need to look underneath your fingernails."
170,00:12:45,00:12:48,You want to show me what's in your hand?
171,00:12:49,00:12:51,It's okay.
172,00:12:58,00:13:00,Where did you get that?
173,00:13:01,00:13:04,"Go! Run, Sasha, run!"
174,00:13:06,00:13:09,I ran out after they drove off.
175,00:13:12,00:13:14,I picked that up.
176,00:13:14,00:13:16,I bet it felt cold when you picked it up.
177,00:13:16,00:13:19,No.
178,00:13:19,00:13:21,No... hot.
179,00:13:21,00:13:23,Hmm.
180,00:13:23,00:13:24,You're tricking me.
181,00:13:25,00:13:27,You're too smart for that.
182,00:13:29,00:13:35,You can spot a Glock cartridge from a block away: rectangular firing pin impression breach face shear.
183,00:13:35,00:13:36,This casing's no Glock.
184,00:13:36,00:13:37,It's isn't your Chief's weapon.
185,00:13:37,00:13:39,"Well, whoever this guy is, he's a lousy shot."
186,00:13:39,00:13:40,"Five casings, no hits."
187,00:13:41,00:13:43,"Oh, by the way, I'm Calleigh Duquesne."
188,00:13:43,00:13:45,Don't ask me how to spell it. Southern.
189,00:13:45,00:13:48,Catherine Willows. Southern... Nevada.
190,00:13:48,00:13:51,You got a theory on how the mother and daughter ended up all the way in Miami from Las Vegas?
191,00:13:52,00:13:53,"Well, we don't actually work theories."
192,00:13:53,00:13:54,"Do we, Warrick?"
193,00:13:55,00:13:56,"No, just evidence."
194,00:13:56,00:13:59,We're much more fanciful down here.
195,00:13:59,00:14:00,"Aren't we, Horatio?"
196,00:14:00,00:14:01,I think that's a fair description.
197,00:14:01,00:14:04,"My guess is, this belongs to Taurus 9, made in Brazil."
198,00:14:04,00:14:10,It's a cheap Beretta knockoff and you may not see many of them in Vegas but we get them down here all the time.
199,00:14:10,00:14:13,Which makes me think this guy wasn't fleeing Las Vegas.
200,00:14:13,00:14:15,He was coming home to Miami.
201,00:14:16,00:14:20,"Well, it's no longer ""Trunk Man."" Identified him from his dental records."
202,00:14:20,00:14:23,Jason Doyle. Dead for three days; no GSR.
203,00:14:24,00:14:26,"So, I guess he didn't shoot Rittle."
204,00:14:26,00:14:28,We only recovered one slug from his cranium.
205,00:14:28,00:14:32,And I got this fragment from his lower back.
206,00:14:33,00:14:34,His lower back?
207,00:14:34,00:14:37,I thought he was shot twice in the head.
208,00:14:37,00:14:38,Vascular embolization.
209,00:14:38,00:14:40,Bullet got into his arterial system.
210,00:14:40,00:14:41,That's rare.
211,00:14:41,00:14:45,"Well, it took a full-body x-ray for me to find the thing."
212,00:14:45,00:14:54,Bullet entered here fragmenting at the neck and losing velocity upon penetration of the carotid artery.
213,00:14:54,00:14:57,"Tube down the aorta, continually losing momentum."
214,00:14:57,00:15:05,"As it exited the aorta, it struck the vertebral column and then was swept down to the base of the aorta where I recovered it here at the lumbar region."
215,00:15:05,00:15:06,(huffs)
216,00:15:07,00:15:08,Pinball.
217,00:15:09,00:15:11,"Looks like nines, like we found in the Chief."
218,00:15:11,00:15:13,I'll call Catherine. Thanks.
219,00:15:13,00:15:14,Yeah.
220,00:15:18,00:15:19,"Hey, Nick..."
221,00:15:19,00:15:20,Mm-hmm?
222,00:15:20,00:15:22,You ever been to a swingers' party?
223,00:15:23,00:15:26,"Well, if it's the same thing as a frat party yeah, lots of them."
224,00:15:26,00:15:30,"You know, you get enough booze going things can get pretty wild."
225,00:15:30,00:15:32,"Frat party, huh?"
226,00:15:32,00:15:35,I wouldn't know anything about that.
227,00:15:39,00:15:41,How wild?
228,00:15:42,00:15:44,Multiple-partner wild.
229,00:15:44,00:15:49,"And it'd be no big deal to have two, maybe three girls at once, just..."
230,00:15:49,00:15:51,(beeping)
231,00:15:51,00:15:54,Hit on the rock glass.
232,00:15:54,00:15:55,"""Work card."
233,00:15:55,00:15:59,"Orpheus Hotel. Tiffany Langer."" Who's she?"
234,00:15:59,00:16:00,Showgirl.
235,00:16:02,00:16:04,"Yes, I went to the party."
236,00:16:04,00:16:05,"No, I didn't go alone."
237,00:16:05,00:16:10,"And no, I'm not telling you my date's name or anyone else who was there."
238,00:16:10,00:16:12,These people are important.
239,00:16:12,00:16:17,"Well, a very important police officer was murdered there."
240,00:16:17,00:16:18,I don't care.
241,00:16:18,00:16:22,It took me a long time to get into the circle and I plan on staying there.
242,00:16:22,00:16:24,Was there anybody there you didn't know?
243,00:16:24,00:16:26,"Anybody who wasn't in ""the circle""?"
244,00:16:26,00:16:28,"Well, my date."
245,00:16:28,00:16:30,Do you know where he is?
246,00:16:30,00:16:32,I haven't seen him since that night.
247,00:16:32,00:16:35,He sent me home with a judge and his wife.
248,00:16:35,00:16:38,So... your date stayed at the party after you left?
249,00:16:38,00:16:40,As far as I know.
250,00:16:41,00:16:42,Where does he live?
251,00:16:42,00:16:43,I don't know.
252,00:16:43,00:16:44,I've known him for five days.
253,00:16:45,00:16:47,"GRISSOM: Well, that's 120 hours."
254,00:16:47,00:16:50,There must be something you know about him that you could share with us.
255,00:16:50,00:16:55,"Right-handed, a Libra, circumcised, rich..."
256,00:16:55,00:16:57,Back-East rich.
257,00:16:57,00:16:59,Which kind of surprised me because he wore really cheap cologne.
258,00:16:59,00:17:03,Cheap? How?
259,00:17:03,00:17:06,Smelled funny... sweet.
260,00:17:06,00:17:07,Are you sure it was cologne?
261,00:17:07,00:17:08,Or deodorant.
262,00:17:08,00:17:10,Mouthwash maybe.
263,00:17:10,00:17:12,All I know is it smelled sickly sweet.
264,00:17:12,00:17:17,To be honest I thought he could have used a little help in that department.
265,00:17:18,00:17:22,Would you happen to have an article of clothing of his by any chance?
266,00:17:22,00:17:24,The only thing he gave me was a good time.
267,00:17:24,00:17:25,"Hey, guess what?"
268,00:17:25,00:17:27,This isn't about you.
269,00:17:28,00:17:30,This is about a missing seven-year-old girl.
270,00:17:33,00:17:35,Why don't you give us his name.
271,00:17:37,00:17:41,Adam Van der Welk.
272,00:17:41,00:17:44,"Uh, no, the Chief's little girl is with Child Services."
273,00:17:44,00:17:47,We're still at the drop-off place.
274,00:17:47,00:17:48,"Yeah, right."
275,00:17:48,00:17:49,"Will do, Brass."
276,00:17:49,00:17:50,I got a pill.
277,00:17:50,00:17:52,Looks like sedative.
278,00:17:56,00:17:58,Okay.
279,00:17:59,00:18:01,Diazapam.
280,00:18:01,00:18:02,Benzos...
281,00:18:02,00:18:05,That could explain why the mother didn't escape with her daughter.
282,00:18:05,00:18:06,She was incapacitated.
283,00:18:08,00:18:09,Go!
284,00:18:11,00:18:12,How'd the little girl get away?
285,00:18:12,00:18:15,We got some tire treads on the shoulder.
286,00:18:15,00:18:17,Made an easy stop.
287,00:18:17,00:18:20,And why did he pick such a secluded area?
288,00:18:20,00:18:22,Seems like a great place to ice someone.
289,00:18:22,00:18:24,Or take a leak.
290,00:18:24,00:18:27,Maybe that's why he stopped the car here... to take a leak.
291,00:18:30,00:18:32,"Run! Run, Sash, run!"
292,00:18:32,00:18:38,Let me ask you another question: When you're home alone do you lock the bathroom door?
293,00:18:38,00:18:39,I don't even know you.
294,00:18:39,00:18:40,Sure you do.
295,00:18:40,00:18:41,We all do.
296,00:18:41,00:18:44,"It's human nature to avoid being vulnerable, isn't it?"
297,00:18:44,00:18:51,"So, if that's the case then he would look for a tree to shield himself, wouldn't he?"
298,00:18:51,00:18:58,"So, then the question becomes how far along this path before he loses sight of them?"
299,00:18:58,00:19:00,Not very far.
300,00:19:01,00:19:02,Look at this.
301,00:19:02,00:19:03,Bang. Footprints...
302,00:19:05,00:19:07,and this is urine.
303,00:19:11,00:19:14,If you're lucky urethral cells with slough off with urine.
304,00:19:15,00:19:20,But if we get his DNA there's a chance we'll get him.
305,00:19:20,00:19:21,(cell phone rings)
306,00:19:21,00:19:23,Yeah. Caine.
307,00:19:23,00:19:24,What do you mean FBI?
308,00:19:29,00:19:31,WILLOWS: So you're saying the guy has B.O.?
309,00:19:32,00:19:34,"GRISSOM: Body odor, bad breath."
310,00:19:34,00:19:37,I don't know; there's something about Adam Van der Welk that makes him smell.
311,00:19:37,00:19:41,All this because some showgirl said he smelled sweet?
312,00:19:41,00:19:42,Sickly sweet.
313,00:19:42,00:19:44,"Smells can be like fingerprints, my dear."
314,00:19:44,00:19:46,"Hey, what's going on there?"
315,00:19:46,00:19:48,I thought you were meeting the Feds?
316,00:19:48,00:19:50,"Uh, yeah, we are. They picked the place."
317,00:19:50,00:19:51,The Shore Club.
318,00:19:51,00:19:53,Later.
319,00:19:54,00:19:56,What's taking so long?
320,00:19:56,00:19:58,That is a good question.
321,00:20:00,00:20:02,"Hey, I just ran into a Fed in the lobby."
322,00:20:03,00:20:10,He told me that apparently the Vegas case fits the profile of a serial the FBI's been tracking.
323,00:20:10,00:20:11,"Hey, you're from Vegas?"
324,00:20:11,00:20:12,Speedle. Brown.
325,00:20:12,00:20:14,Where was the Fed?
326,00:20:14,00:20:15,He's right there in the lobby.
327,00:20:15,00:20:18,He's got his little headphone on and his little tie.
328,00:20:18,00:20:19,And you talked to him?
329,00:20:19,00:20:20,Yeah.
330,00:20:20,00:20:22,Do they have an ID yet?
331,00:20:22,00:20:27,"No ID yet, but their perp targets wealthy couples at their playgrounds..."
332,00:20:27,00:20:31,"Pebble Beach, Aspen, the Hamptons."
333,00:20:31,00:20:35,Evidently the husbands get murdered first and the wives later.
334,00:20:35,00:20:38,After they've enjoyed 48 hours of fun and games.
335,00:20:38,00:20:39,48?
336,00:20:39,00:20:41,Vegas?
337,00:20:41,00:20:42,Speedle. Willows.
338,00:20:44,00:20:45,That's it?
339,00:20:45,00:20:46,There's also a link to Miami.
340,00:20:46,00:20:48,Of course there is.
341,00:20:48,00:20:52,"Or, you know, he could just be some geriatric dude that just digs the weather."
342,00:20:52,00:20:54,WILLOWS: I don't understand.
343,00:20:54,00:20:56,Why didn't the Feds put this out on NCIC?
344,00:20:56,00:20:57,Because they're Feds.
345,00:20:57,00:20:59,Excuse me.
346,00:21:00,00:21:04,Dennis... Dennis...
347,00:21:04,00:21:05,"Tick-tock, Dennis."
348,00:21:05,00:21:09,"While you're waiting to get your ducks in a row the guy with the ""Miami link"" just slipped through my hands."
349,00:21:09,00:21:11,"Horatio, I didn't have Federal approval..."
350,00:21:11,00:21:13,I need answers for this little girl.
351,00:21:13,00:21:15,"Her father's just been killed, maybe her mother, too."
352,00:21:15,00:21:17,And that's your fault.
353,00:21:17,00:21:18,You understand that.
354,00:21:18,00:21:20,It sounds like you're making this personal.
355,00:21:20,00:21:25,"Dennis, you don't give me this link I will make this very personal."
356,00:21:27,00:21:30,All of his victims stayed here in the last year.
357,00:21:31,00:21:32,Here? This hotel?
358,00:21:32,00:21:35,"Rittle and his wife, too. Last winter."
359,00:21:35,00:21:36,"Mm, I wish I would have known that."
360,00:21:36,00:21:38,Maybe they'd still be alive.
361,00:21:38,00:21:39,Yeah?
362,00:21:41,00:21:43,(speaking Spanish)
363,00:21:45,00:21:48,Si... Vamos.
364,00:21:48,00:21:51,I had a bad feeling about this.
365,00:21:51,00:21:52,What'd she just say to you?
366,00:21:52,00:21:54,She just said that you need to learn the language.
367,00:22:00,00:22:01,I don't see this burgundy car.
368,00:22:01,00:22:02,Where are you looking?
369,00:22:03,00:22:06,Check the disturbance along the bank and follow it in.
370,00:22:06,00:22:08,How did you find the disturbance?
371,00:22:08,00:22:09,Drive up and down the canals all day?
372,00:22:09,00:22:13,"No, the thing about Miami is the entire city's watched from above."
373,00:22:13,00:22:15,Coast Guard choppers.
374,00:22:15,00:22:16,Someone going to cover me?
375,00:22:16,00:22:17,I got you.
376,00:22:18,00:22:21,WILLOWS: Cover you for what?
377,00:22:21,00:22:22,Alligators.
378,00:22:24,00:22:28,Only way to outrun a gator is to swim faster than the guy next to you.
379,00:22:28,00:22:30,"Isn't that right, Delko?"
380,00:22:30,00:22:32,Used to have a partner.
381,00:22:32,00:22:33,CAINE: Guys...
382,00:22:33,00:22:34,please?
383,00:23:32,00:23:33,That her?
384,00:23:34,00:23:36,"Yeah, that's Mina Rittle."
385,00:23:53,00:23:55,"Our guy's still in the wind, folks."
386,00:23:55,00:23:59,Still in the wind.
387,00:24:06,00:24:07,What's her name?
388,00:24:07,00:24:08,Mina Rittle.
389,00:24:09,00:24:11,"Who wrapped you, Mina?"
390,00:24:13,00:24:15,The plastic wasn't for transport.
391,00:24:15,00:24:18,Covering her intimates-- most likely sexual.
392,00:24:18,00:24:20,Two gunshot wounds left temple.
393,00:24:20,00:24:22,One shot was a through-and-through.
394,00:24:23,00:24:25,"Trace ASAP, along with the plastic."
395,00:24:26,00:24:34,My preliminary probe shows water in the lungs which indicates she was still alive when she was put in the canal.
396,00:24:36,00:24:40,Looks like the eyes are glued shut.
397,00:24:40,00:24:44,Gold crusty substance underneath.
398,00:24:44,00:24:46,"What is that, Mina?"
399,00:24:53,00:24:56,The substance is water-soluble.
400,00:24:56,00:24:58,But somehow it got preserved in the water.
401,00:24:58,00:25:03,My guess is the plastic was wrapped around her eyes at some point.
402,00:25:03,00:25:05,Wait a minute.
403,00:25:07,00:25:09,There's a lot more of it.
404,00:25:11,00:25:15,What do you want to bet this is in every orifice?
405,00:25:19,00:25:21,You guys got a sick one.
406,00:25:37,00:25:39,Aha!
407,00:25:39,00:25:42,"Delko, you've been down there for 45 minutes."
408,00:25:42,00:25:44,Do you know the level of bacteria in the water?
409,00:25:44,00:25:45,You can get all kinds of infections.
410,00:25:45,00:25:46,What do you got?
411,00:25:46,00:25:48,Water pistol.
412,00:25:48,00:25:51,One water-logged Beretta knock-off.
413,00:25:51,00:25:53,Suspect's personal gun?
414,00:25:53,00:25:55,That's it. Congratulations.
415,00:25:55,00:25:59,I'll put it over the wires that he's not carrying that Taurus anymore.
416,00:25:59,00:26:01,"Do that, and take a shower."
417,00:26:01,00:26:02,Nice shoes.
418,00:26:04,00:26:07,"Ma'am, you have to concentrate on the face."
419,00:26:07,00:26:09,"In parts, not just the whole."
420,00:26:09,00:26:11,Ask me what he wore.
421,00:26:11,00:26:13,Ask me if he was good in bed.
422,00:26:13,00:26:15,Just don't ask me how close together his eyes were.
423,00:26:15,00:26:17,"You said he kind of looked like Ricky Martin, right?"
424,00:26:17,00:26:19,"Yeah, with a touch of Jude Law."
425,00:26:19,00:26:22,ARTIST: Try to not just picture him.
426,00:26:22,00:26:24,Try to think of an event.
427,00:26:25,00:26:27,Okay...
428,00:26:27,00:26:29,Three-way kiss.
429,00:26:29,00:26:31,His lower lip was kind of pouty...
430,00:26:31,00:26:39,"and he had this Michael Douglas thing working, you know--- a cleft in his chin."
431,00:26:39,00:26:40,Kind of like that?
432,00:26:40,00:26:41,Yeah.
433,00:26:41,00:26:45,You're right. That is easier.
434,00:27:04,00:27:06,Adam Van der Welk.
435,00:27:06,00:27:08,Little girl saw a monster.
436,00:27:08,00:27:10,Showgirl saw a husband.
437,00:27:10,00:27:12,So this guy could be anybody.
438,00:27:12,00:27:15,"STOKES: Yeah, that's the problem with eyewitnesses."
439,00:27:15,00:27:17,All the more reason to rely on evidence.
440,00:27:17,00:27:19,Tell Warrick hey. Let me know if anything breaks.
441,00:27:19,00:27:20,"You, too."
442,00:27:20,00:27:21,Hey.
443,00:27:21,00:27:22,Hey.
444,00:27:22,00:27:25,"So, how's your colleague Grissom doing on the aroma angle?"
445,00:27:25,00:27:30,I'm sure he's making progress but Grissom rarely says anything until he's good and ready.
446,00:27:30,00:27:31,Smart man.
447,00:27:31,00:27:33,I just wanted to show you something.
448,00:27:33,00:27:36,"The sticky substance we got off the wife is, in fact, honey."
449,00:27:36,00:27:38,You say that like it means something.
450,00:27:38,00:27:44,"Well, honey on its own is just honey but when you add plastic wrap, it's... a different situation."
451,00:27:45,00:27:47,(techno-pop playing)
452,00:27:47,00:27:49,(cheering)
453,00:27:56,00:27:59,(crowd chanting) Five... four... three...
454,00:27:59,00:28:02,...two... one...
455,00:28:02,00:28:03,(cheering)
456,00:28:24,00:28:26,Yum.
457,00:28:26,00:28:29,This is where he got the idea.
458,00:28:29,00:28:31,Yep. This is Hives.
459,00:28:31,00:28:32,Wish me luck.
460,00:28:36,00:28:37,Excuse me.
461,00:28:37,00:28:39,Excuse me.
462,00:28:39,00:28:41,Hi.
463,00:28:41,00:28:43,Some guys like to lick it off.
464,00:28:43,00:28:46,Really? I'm partial to the swab myself.
465,00:28:48,00:28:49,"Ready, honey?"
466,00:28:49,00:28:51,"Coming, dear."
467,00:28:54,00:28:59,Tuberculosis victims emit breath that smells like wet leaves.
468,00:28:59,00:29:01,"Maple, elm, ash, what?"
469,00:29:01,00:29:02,I'm not sure.
470,00:29:02,00:29:08,"Miami is pulling cars out of canals-- chasing leads, debriefing the kid-- and you guys are flipping through textbooks?"
471,00:29:08,00:29:10,This is how I work.
472,00:29:10,00:29:12,Tuberculosis.
473,00:29:12,00:29:14,Cyanide Poisoning.
474,00:29:14,00:29:16,Endocrinology.
475,00:29:16,00:29:18,I'm following my nosino.
476,00:29:18,00:29:23,You're closer to this Van der Welk guy than you're letting on aren't you?
477,00:29:23,00:29:26,Doctor...
478,00:29:26,00:29:27,Doctor.
479,00:29:28,00:29:29,How about Darier disease?
480,00:29:29,00:29:33,Doesn't that give you a rash that smells like human excrement?
481,00:29:33,00:29:36,We're looking for something a little sweeter.
482,00:29:36,00:29:39,There's diabetic ketoacidosis.
483,00:29:39,00:29:42,Body has excess glucose which converts to ketone...
484,00:29:42,00:29:45,gets expelled through the pores.
485,00:29:45,00:29:47,Has a fruity smell.
486,00:29:47,00:29:50,It would help if we had a piece of the assailant's clothing.
487,00:29:54,00:29:55,What?
488,00:29:55,00:29:57,I think I overlooked some evidence.
489,00:30:00,00:30:06,SPEEDLE: I'm going to isolate it using high-performance liquid chromatography.
490,00:30:06,00:30:10,Once we identify the pollen we'll know if it's floral honey.
491,00:30:17,00:30:20,"So, H, when's the last time you were in Hives?"
492,00:30:20,00:30:22,I was there opening night.
493,00:30:22,00:30:24,I didn't see you there.
494,00:30:24,00:30:25,"I was, uh..."
495,00:30:25,00:30:26,VIP.
496,00:30:29,00:30:32,What is this?
497,00:30:32,00:30:33,It's Tupelo honey.
498,00:30:33,00:30:35,It's the purest of all honeys.
499,00:30:35,00:30:36,Stays in liquid form for life.
500,00:30:36,00:30:38,Doesn't crystallize or harden.
501,00:30:38,00:30:39,Where'd you get that?
502,00:30:39,00:30:42,CDC hipped me to it after that Africanized bee problem.
503,00:30:42,00:30:44,"Okay, let's swap this out."
504,00:30:44,00:30:47,I want you to take a look at this.
505,00:30:48,00:30:51,We got this off the Chief's wife.
506,00:30:56,00:30:58,It's a match.
507,00:30:59,00:31:01,It's a match.
508,00:31:01,00:31:03,WARRICK: $500 for five dollars worth of honey?
509,00:31:03,00:31:04,I don't think it's worth it.
510,00:31:04,00:31:10,Those are mostly for decoration but once in a while some bigwig comes takes one of them out of here.
511,00:31:10,00:31:11,Wouldn't it have been easier to put these in order?
512,00:31:11,00:31:12,This is going to take forever.
513,00:31:12,00:31:15,WOMAN: Maybe not. I've got a receipt from just two nights ago.
514,00:31:15,00:31:16,Let me see that.
515,00:31:19,00:31:21,Do you recognize this guy?
516,00:31:21,00:31:24,"Yeah, looks just like every other Joe that comes in here."
517,00:31:24,00:31:25,"Look, you work the door."
518,00:31:26,00:31:32,Anybody come in here in the last 48 hours that bought some of that very expensive Tupelo honey This is Miami.
519,00:31:32,00:31:34,Every night's a weekend.
520,00:31:34,00:31:37,My people tell me that a customer came in here two nights ago to buy some.
521,00:31:37,00:31:39,Wasn't a customer. It was a limo driver.
522,00:31:39,00:31:40,A limo driver?
523,00:31:40,00:31:41,"Yeah, Gordon."
524,00:31:41,00:31:42,Gave me a C-note just to double park.
525,00:31:43,00:31:45,Did this Gordon tell you who he had in back of his car?
526,00:31:45,00:31:46,No.
527,00:31:46,00:31:49,Just that it was some rich guy-- some high roller.
528,00:31:49,00:31:52,Let me guess-- from Vegas.
529,00:31:52,00:31:53,Yeah.
530,00:31:57,00:32:00,(siren blaring)
531,00:32:05,00:32:06,How'd you find him?
532,00:32:06,00:32:09,"Figured, limo driver-- airport."
533,00:32:09,00:32:14,I spotted Gordon here on Alton-- back way to Miami International.
534,00:32:14,00:32:17,"Lit him up, pulled him over here."
535,00:32:17,00:32:18,Nice work.
536,00:32:18,00:32:20,"You got a last name, Gordon?"
537,00:32:20,00:32:21,Daimler.
538,00:32:21,00:32:24,"Look, Officer, the Corwins are coming in on their own private jet."
539,00:32:24,00:32:26,They're two of my best customers.
540,00:32:26,00:32:27,I really should be there.
541,00:32:27,00:32:30,"Well, the Corwins are going to have to wait."
542,00:32:30,00:32:36,WILLOWS: We understand that another one of your customers bought some very expensive honey from a club.
543,00:32:36,00:32:38,"Yeah, well, I've had stranger requests."
544,00:32:38,00:32:41,This customer of yours have a name?
545,00:32:41,00:32:42,Never got it. He paid cash.
546,00:32:42,00:32:43,Never saw a credit card.
547,00:32:43,00:32:46,"Well, did you notice anything unusual about him?"
548,00:32:47,00:32:49,Did he smell?
549,00:32:49,00:32:50,Did he...
550,00:32:50,00:32:51,have an odor?
551,00:32:51,00:32:53,"Uh, his breath maybe."
552,00:32:53,00:32:54,He'd been drinking a lot.
553,00:32:55,00:32:56,Remember what he was drinking?
554,00:32:56,00:32:57,Was it sweet like Irish whiskey?
555,00:32:57,00:32:58,Whatever I have stocked.
556,00:32:59,00:33:00,"Well, we'd like to take a look."
557,00:33:00,00:33:01,Sure. Go ahead.
558,00:33:31,00:33:32,Gin.
559,00:33:32,00:33:35,(engine starting)
560,00:33:44,00:33:46,Hmm.
561,00:33:50,00:33:52,Smell that?
562,00:33:52,00:33:53,Sickly sweet.
563,00:33:53,00:33:57,That's exactly how Grissom described it.
564,00:34:02,00:34:04,You want me to do what?
565,00:34:04,00:34:06,Smell this.
566,00:34:15,00:34:16,That's it.
567,00:34:16,00:34:18,That's Adam's smell.
568,00:34:18,00:34:22,In the five days that you two were together did you happen to notice what he was drinking?
569,00:34:22,00:34:24,Champagne.
570,00:34:24,00:34:27,Did he ever drink anything sweeter like whiskey or cognac?
571,00:34:27,00:34:29,Are you kidding me?
572,00:34:29,00:34:32,With him it was all Dom all the time.
573,00:34:34,00:34:36,You found a medical condition.
574,00:34:36,00:34:40,GRISSOM: Diabetic ketoacidosis-- it's an insulin deficiency.
575,00:34:40,00:34:43,His body's been expelling excess glucose.
576,00:34:43,00:34:44,Makes him smell fruity.
577,00:34:44,00:34:48,Which I guess could easily be mistaken for whiskey breath.
578,00:34:48,00:34:54,"Hey, can you test for diabetic ketoacidosis off urine?"
579,00:34:54,00:34:57,"Well, blood's the best but if you had a urine sample, maybe."
580,00:34:57,00:35:01,Ask him what medication you would take for that.
581,00:35:01,00:35:03,What would a doctor prescribe?
582,00:35:03,00:35:05,Novalin insulin.
583,00:35:08,00:35:10,Lucky for us we found blood in his urine.
584,00:35:10,00:35:12,Absence of C-Peptide in the blood.
585,00:35:12,00:35:16,Means the insulin in our guy's system isn't natural-- it's synthetic.
586,00:35:16,00:35:17,And prescribed.
587,00:35:17,00:35:19,We're right over here. This is our database.
588,00:35:22,00:35:29,"Okay, what we're looking for is a patient who's purchased synthetic insulin in the last 48 hours."
589,00:35:34,00:35:37,Here we go.
590,00:35:43,00:35:44,Gordon Daimler.
591,00:35:44,00:35:46,That's the limo driver.
592,00:35:46,00:35:48,That's him.
593,00:35:48,00:35:54,"And the reason that old Gordon probably didn't smell when we picked him up is because he'd just taken his insulin, hadn't he?"
594,00:35:54,00:35:58,But the scent was still in the limo's AC system.
595,00:35:58,00:36:00,"Well, now we have this guy's address."
596,00:36:00,00:36:01,"Yes, take a look at this address."
597,00:36:01,00:36:05,A limousine driver with a house on the water in Coconut Grove?
598,00:36:06,00:36:07,I don't think so.
599,00:36:07,00:36:10,Who's the owner of record?
600,00:36:10,00:36:12,Let's check it.
601,00:36:15,00:36:16,Sissy and Dylan Corwin.
602,00:36:20,00:36:23,That's the couple he was picking up at the airport when we pulled him over.
603,00:36:23,00:36:24,That's right.
604,00:36:24,00:36:28,So then maybe that's how he finds his victims-- driving a limo.
605,00:36:29,00:36:35,"And when they're away at some posh resort he moves into their house, doesn't he?"
606,00:36:35,00:36:38,Hops over to Las Vegas.
607,00:36:38,00:36:40,Visits the couple he met in Miami.
608,00:36:40,00:36:41,Kills the husband... Mm-hmm.
609,00:36:41,00:36:44,...brings the wife back here-- kills her.
610,00:36:44,00:36:45,And when the Corwins come home...
611,00:36:47,00:36:48,not good.
612,00:37:01,00:37:03,WILLOW: No one's answering inside.
613,00:37:08,00:37:10,Miami-Dade Police!
614,00:37:43,00:37:44,Slowly.
615,00:37:46,00:37:47,Slowly.
616,00:38:06,00:38:08,I got a blood trail here.
617,00:38:08,00:38:10,Leading to the garage.
618,00:38:52,00:38:55,He dragged the body to here...
619,00:38:55,00:38:57,Put her in that car.
620,00:38:57,00:38:58,Nine-mil.
621,00:39:02,00:39:04,One shot's a through-and-through.
622,00:39:04,00:39:05,Scalp hair.
623,00:39:07,00:39:09,He fired this one first.
624,00:39:09,00:39:10,I don't know.
625,00:39:10,00:39:12,To terrorize her.
626,00:39:12,00:39:14,This strike here.
627,00:39:14,00:39:16,That one's all business.
628,00:39:43,00:39:46,He wrapped her in plastic by the bed raped her.
629,00:39:46,00:39:50,Then dragged her in here and cornered her like an animal.
630,00:39:50,00:39:53,If Gordon's true to form he's going to kill the Corwins.
631,00:39:54,00:39:56,You guys should take a look at this.
632,00:39:57,00:40:01,"Well, people don't really buy these houses for the view."
633,00:40:01,00:40:04,It's a place to put a million-dollar boat.
634,00:40:04,00:40:05,But what's your point?
635,00:40:08,00:40:13,The boat's missing and that's where he's killing them right now.
636,00:40:13,00:40:14,"Speed, get on that thing right now."
637,00:40:14,00:40:17,Put the birds in the air and call the Coast Guard.
638,00:40:17,00:40:18,Right now. Do it.
639,00:40:18,00:40:19,"Air and Sea, this is Tim Speedle."
640,00:40:19,00:40:22,"I need you to be on the lookout for a yacht, T-45."
641,00:40:22,00:40:24,R.O. Dylan and Sissy Corwin.
642,00:40:24,00:40:26,Commandeered by one Gordon Daimler.
643,00:40:26,00:40:27,Gordon Daimler.
644,00:40:27,00:40:29,Commandeered by...
645,00:40:29,00:40:30,Gordon Daimler.
646,00:40:36,00:40:38,Coast Guard found her adrift!
647,00:40:38,00:40:39,No radio contact!
648,00:40:41,00:40:42,We hailed her.
649,00:40:42,00:40:43,No response.
650,00:40:44,00:40:45,Infrared's up.
651,00:40:45,00:40:46,"Blue means dead, red means alive."
652,00:40:47,00:40:48,Pink.
653,00:40:48,00:40:50,Body heat's fading. Person's dying.
654,00:40:50,00:40:51,Identify the other players.
655,00:40:51,00:40:52,Speed?
656,00:40:52,00:40:55,Red. Is that our suspect?
657,00:40:55,00:40:56,I'm not sure.
658,00:40:56,00:40:57,I am.
659,00:40:57,00:40:58,How?
660,00:40:58,00:41:00,We haven't identified all the players.
661,00:41:00,00:41:02,He's going back to finish off the job. Detweiler.
662,00:41:02,00:41:04,"Getting a bead on him, sir."
663,00:41:04,00:41:08,The M.O. on this guy says husband's already dead.
664,00:41:08,00:41:10,He's going back to finish off the wife.
665,00:41:10,00:41:11,You're good to go.
666,00:41:11,00:41:14,Body language does not look like an attack.
667,00:41:21,00:41:22,"Wait a minute, wait a minute."
668,00:41:22,00:41:24,Don't the Corwins have a jet?
669,00:41:24,00:41:25,The Corwins have a jet!
670,00:41:25,00:41:26,That's where Daimler is.
671,00:41:26,00:41:28,It's the Corwins in there.
672,00:41:28,00:41:30,"Abort this, Sackheim! Abort this!"
673,00:41:30,00:41:32,"Interstate case, not your call! Proceed!"
674,00:41:32,00:41:34,Stand down!
675,00:41:34,00:41:35,Take him out!
676,00:41:37,00:41:41,"Detweiler, I know you want to impress your boss but there's an innocent man on that boat."
677,00:41:41,00:41:45,"Now, if you take this shot I'm going to be in your grille for the rest of your natural life."
678,00:41:45,00:41:48,I want you to think about what that might be like.
679,00:41:50,00:41:51,Think about that.
680,00:41:58,00:42:01,"Thank you. Speed, the Corwins have a jet."
681,00:42:01,00:42:02,Find the jet.
682,00:42:02,00:42:07,Call the FAA and ground the jet by authority of Miami-DadeCounty.
683,00:42:07,00:42:08,"You got it, H."
684,00:42:08,00:42:09,Give us 30 seconds.
685,00:42:10,00:42:11,Then send backup!
686,00:42:17,00:42:18,Mr. Corwin!
687,00:42:18,00:42:22,I tried to save her.
688,00:42:22,00:42:24,It's too late.
689,00:42:24,00:42:25,I'm sorry.
690,00:42:25,00:42:27,(sobbing)
691,00:42:29,00:42:31,Get me Fire Rescue.
692,00:42:36,00:42:39,"Few more minutes, sir. We'll be on the way to Monaco."
693,00:42:48,00:42:49,Good evening.
694,00:42:50,00:42:53,Mr. Van der Welk.
695,00:42:53,00:42:55,"Gordon, drive your limo here?"
696,00:42:58,00:42:59,He's clean.
697,00:42:59,00:43:01,The Corwins...
698,00:43:01,00:43:02,are my friends.
699,00:43:02,00:43:03,They lent me this plane.
700,00:43:03,00:43:05,Like the lent you their boat?
701,00:43:05,00:43:07,Speak to the pilot.
702,00:43:07,00:43:09,Dylan Corwin called him personally.
703,00:43:09,00:43:11,Directed him to fly me to Monaco.
704,00:43:11,00:43:15,"I'd rather call ""Dylan"" at the hospital to confirm."
705,00:43:15,00:43:17,WILLOW: The husband didn't die.
706,00:43:17,00:43:23,He left us a witness and enough evidence to convict you in two states.
707,00:43:23,00:43:25,Rich men don't go to jail.
708,00:43:25,00:43:27,"You're not rich, Gordon."
709,00:43:36,00:43:37,"I'm going to, uh..."
710,00:43:37,00:43:38,I'm going to book this guy.
711,00:43:38,00:43:39,You want to go with?
712,00:43:39,00:43:41,"Nah, you got it."
713,00:43:41,00:43:43,I'll have my DA call your DA.
714,00:43:43,00:43:44,(chuckles)
715,00:43:45,00:43:47,Sounds good.
716,00:43:47,00:43:48,Sounds good.
717,00:43:48,00:43:51,Uh... Thank you for your help on this.
718,00:43:51,00:43:53,"Thanks for yours, actually."
719,00:43:53,00:43:56,Right.
720,00:43:57,00:43:59,You take care of yourself.
721,00:43:59,00:44:01,I always do.
722,00:44:19,00:44:20,Hey.
723,00:44:27,00:44:29,"My mommy and daddy are dead, aren't they?"
724,00:44:33,00:44:37,"Well, your aunt is flying in to talk to you."
725,00:44:37,00:44:40,That's a yes.
726,00:44:42,00:44:44,I lost someone once.
727,00:44:44,00:44:47,Who?
728,00:44:47,00:44:50,Well...
729,00:44:51,00:44:53,Did you feel sick?
730,00:44:53,00:44:54,Still do.
731,00:44:54,00:44:56,Still do.
732,00:44:58,00:45:00,Sasha.
733,00:45:00,00:45:09,People are going to say a lot of things about your mom and dad and some of them are going to be true but what I want you to remember is that they fought like heroes for you.
734,00:45:09,00:45:12,Will you remember that for me?
735,00:45:15,00:45:16,Good.
736,00:45:16,00:45:18,Good for you.
737,00:45:28,00:45:30,Hello.
738,00:45:31,00:45:32,Hey.
739,00:45:34,00:45:36,Nice tan.
740,00:45:36,00:45:38,Nice suit.
741,00:45:38,00:45:43,"Yeah, well, I knew you were coming back today, so I dressed up."
742,00:45:43,00:45:44,Yeah.
743,00:45:44,00:45:45,Right.
744,00:45:45,00:45:48,Really.
745,00:45:50,00:45:51,What?
746,00:45:51,00:45:53,Nothing.
747,00:45:53,00:45:57,It's just... unusual to see you dressed like that.
748,00:45:57,00:46:00,I had to go to the Chief's funeral.
749,00:46:00,00:46:02,"Missed me that much, huh?"
