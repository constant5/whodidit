0	00:00:10	00:00:13	I'm gonna be out in a second.
1	00:00:18	00:00:20	Is that a girlfriend? Not right now.
2	00:00:20	00:00:21	Can I see?
3	00:00:21	00:00:22	Ah! Whoa!
4	00:00:22	00:00:23	She wouldn't like that.
5	00:00:23	00:00:25	I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
6	00:00:27	00:00:29	Gonna be here when I get back?
7	00:00:29	00:00:30	If you're lucky.
8	00:00:42	00:00:43	Yeah. Yeah, it's me.
9	00:00:43	00:00:45	I just heard about Ecklie. I'm at, uh...
10	00:00:45	00:00:46	Where am I? I'm at, uh...
11	00:00:46	00:00:48	Bar 483.
12	00:00:48	00:00:50	I'm with Moreno's partner Crenshaw.
13	00:00:50	00:00:52	Jules... Something's definitely not right.
14	00:00:52	00:00:53	What?!
15	00:00:53	00:00:58	McKeen. His-his people, they took Katie for payback for his son or something.
16	00:00:58	00:00:59	Crenshaw's one of 'em.
17	00:00:59	00:01:01	I just know.
18	00:01:01	00:01:03	I'm gonna stick with him and see where he takes me.
19	00:01:03	00:01:06	You get your ass out of there and come back right now-- I've lost enough tonight.
20	00:01:06	00:01:09	I'll be in touch.
21	00:01:09	00:01:12	Your father will not let anything happen to Kaitlyn.
22	00:01:12	00:01:13	No, no, no, no...
23	00:01:13	00:01:15	I want to see her room! You can't come in here.
24	00:01:15	00:01:17	Listen, we have to process the scene.
25	00:01:17	00:01:18	The scene?! What are you talk...
26	00:01:18	00:01:19	Listen to me, will you, please?
27	00:01:19	00:01:21	Listen to me.
28	00:01:21	00:01:22	I promise you I will bring her home.
29	00:01:22	00:01:23	I promise.
30	00:01:25	00:01:27	Go with the vitals on Undersheriff Ecklie.
31	00:01:27	00:01:29	Tachycardia in the 120.
32	00:01:29	00:01:34	82/40 and dropping. O2 sats in the 80s with assisted ventilation. Preparing to transport.
33	00:01:34	00:01:36	One, two, three.
34	00:01:36	00:01:37	What's his condition?
35	00:01:37	00:01:39	Stable but critical.
36	00:01:40	00:01:42	I'm going with him.
37	00:01:47	00:01:49	Russell's granddaughter's been kidnapped.
38	00:01:49	00:01:51	What?! It sounds like it's McKeen.
39	00:01:51	00:01:53	Uh, I've tried Nick three times.
40	00:01:53	00:01:55	He's not picking up.
41	00:01:55	00:01:57	Okay, I'll... I'll handle things here.
42	00:01:57	00:01:59	You should go to Russell's.
43	00:02:00	00:02:02	Be careful.
44	00:02:09	00:02:11	Where's your car?
45	00:02:11	00:02:13	I can't drive.
46	00:02:13	00:02:15	We'll take mine.
47	00:02:17	00:02:18	Where are we going?
48	00:02:18	00:02:20	Relax.
49	00:02:20	00:02:22	Enjoy the ride.
50	00:02:53	00:02:54	How's Maya?
51	00:02:54	00:02:59	I gave her something to calm her.
52	00:02:59	00:03:02	I never thought I would see that in your hand again.
53	00:03:03	00:03:05	Neither did I.
54	00:03:44	00:03:46	Russell...
55	00:03:46	00:03:48	we found some shoe impressions.
56	00:03:48	00:03:51	Some standard work boots. I'm not sure we're gonna get anything.
57	00:03:51	00:03:54	And this didn't come from your house, right? Uh...
58	00:03:54	00:03:56	Could be transfer from the kidnapper.
59	00:03:56	00:03:58	I'm gonna get it to Hodges.
60	00:03:58	00:04:01	Uh, listen, th-there's something else that you need to know.
61	00:04:01	00:04:03	Property of LVPD.
62	00:04:03	00:04:04	Found it under the window.
63	00:04:04	00:04:07	We're looking at a cop.
64	00:04:11	00:04:16	You call Brass, and you tell him I don't want to see anyone here who's not one of his guys.
65	00:04:16	00:04:18	So, what do you want to do?
66	00:04:18	00:04:21	Just work-work the case, please.
67	00:04:21	00:04:22	Dad.
68	00:04:22	00:04:24	Hey, buddy.
69	00:04:29	00:04:31	Officer Tracey.
70	00:04:33	00:04:35	You're relieved of your duty.
71	00:04:35	00:04:38	Officer Mitchell will take over.
72	00:04:38	00:04:39	Now.
73	00:04:53	00:04:55	You don't look like my bus driver.
74	00:04:55	00:05:01	You know, I've been stuck in this cell sucking my thumb for three hours, waiting for my transport back to Ely.
75	00:05:01	00:05:02	On your feet.
76	00:05:06	00:05:08	I'm traveling light these days, Jim.
77	00:05:08	00:05:10	Goes with the uniform.
78	00:05:12	00:05:20	I don't know how you've been communicating with your people on the outside, but however you've been doing it, it's over.
79	00:05:20	00:05:22	You don't talk to anyone, you don't see anyone.
80	00:05:22	00:05:24	Not even my lawyer?
81	00:05:24	00:05:25	Man's got his rights.
82	00:05:25	00:05:28	Not anymore. Is D.B. on board with this?
83	00:05:28	00:05:31	'Cause I think he's really gonna want to talk to me.
84	00:05:36	00:05:39	Anything happens to that little girl...
85	00:05:40	00:05:42	...I got people, too.
86	00:05:54	00:05:57	So this is where you take all your girls?
87	00:05:59	00:06:01	This is where I'm taking you.
88	00:06:26	00:06:28	Moreno? Yeah.
89	00:06:28	00:06:30	Mmm.
90	00:06:30	00:06:31	He had his chance.
91	00:06:34	00:06:36	Hey, maybe this is a bad idea.
92	00:06:36	00:06:38	That's what makes it so good.
93	00:06:50	00:06:51	You asked for a good time, here it is.
94	00:06:53	00:06:54	Yeah.
95	00:06:56	00:06:58	Nick? Where are you?
96	00:06:58	00:07:00	I have been calling and calling.
97	00:07:00	00:07:02	And McKeen unleashed hell...
98	00:07:02	00:07:09	tonight on Russell and Ecklie, and his guys may be after you, and I know that you said that you quit, but could you call me, please?
99	00:07:09	00:07:12	I, uh... I need your help.
100	00:07:14	00:07:16	I need to know that you're all right.
101	00:07:28	00:07:30	Hey, don't worry, we're safe, everybody.
102	00:07:30	00:07:32	The police are here.
103	00:07:34	00:07:37	CSI Stokes.
104	00:07:37	00:07:39	Lot of people looking for you tonight.
105	00:07:39	00:07:41	Well, thank you for the information, Mr. Clean.
106	00:07:41	00:07:44	Well, I'm just minding my own business.
107	00:07:44	00:07:47	Ruining business, according to the liquor store owner.
108	00:07:47	00:07:50	We can take you in for drunk and disorderly.
109	00:07:50	00:07:52	You're right-- I am a little drunk.
110	00:07:52	00:07:55	But if you two chuckleheads don't beat it...
111	00:07:56	00:07:58	...it's gonna get disorderly.
112	00:07:58	00:07:59	Man's got a gun, Hank.
113	00:07:59	00:08:01	Oh, this? Yes, he does.
114	00:08:01	00:08:02	Whoa...
115	00:08:02	00:08:06	You're a little slow on the draw there, Hank.
116	00:08:06	00:08:08	I don't even need this.
117	00:08:11	00:08:13	There's one beer left.
118	00:08:13	00:08:15	I'll fight you for it.
119	00:08:15	00:08:17	Could shoot you for it.
120	00:08:27	00:08:30	You do think she was just kidnapped, right?
121	00:08:30	00:08:32	I don't know what to think.
122	00:08:32	00:08:36	you shouldn't be doing this.
123	00:08:36	00:08:41	It's a conflict of interest, and the evidence will be challenged in court.
124	00:08:41	00:08:45	Yeah, I'm not really thinking about court right now, Sara.
125	00:08:48	00:08:51	You want to open up that kit, or you gonna just stand there?
126	00:08:59	00:09:01	He's still in surgery.
127	00:09:01	00:09:03	I'll be all right, David.
128	00:09:03	00:09:04	Y-You should get back to work.
129	00:09:04	00:09:05	Are you sure?
130	00:09:05	00:09:07	Yeah.
131	00:09:07	00:09:09	Okay, but if-if you need anything, call me.
132	00:09:09	00:09:11	Yeah.
133	00:09:14	00:09:15	I, uh...
134	00:09:15	00:09:18	found this change of clothes in your locker.
135	00:09:18	00:09:22	I remember a car...
136	00:09:22	00:09:24	the sound of a gun...
137	00:09:26	00:09:31	...my-my father lying there, but... I didn't see anything, anyone.
138	00:09:31	00:09:32	I'm useless!
139	00:09:36	00:09:38	Still no word from Finn?
140	00:09:38	00:09:40	No.
141	00:09:40	00:09:44	But Brass talked to Moreno, and evidently, Moreno got a text from Finn and...
142	00:09:44	00:09:45	he's worried.
143	00:09:45	00:09:46	Moreno?
144	00:09:46	00:09:48	You think we can trust him?
145	00:09:48	00:09:50	Well, he's gonna be here in a few minutes.
146	00:09:50	00:09:52	You can ask him yourself.
147	00:10:03	00:10:05	More transfer.
148	00:10:05	00:10:07	Same as I found outside.
149	00:10:07	00:10:09	This comes with a bonus.
150	00:10:09	00:10:11	Hair.
151	00:10:15	00:10:17	Karma, Jeffrey.
152	00:10:17	00:10:20	Your son paid for your sins.
153	00:10:20	00:10:23	One phone call from me, and your family's living out of a car.
154	00:10:23	00:10:25	You leave my family out of this, D.B.
155	00:10:25	00:10:27	Karma-- what's it mean?
156	00:10:27	00:10:29	Ecklie's words.
157	00:10:29	00:10:33	McKeen's sending me the same message.
158	00:10:35	00:10:37	No...!
159	00:10:44	00:10:47	I guess I, uh, I should get all this back to the lab.
160	00:10:57	00:10:59	I've been calling you.
161	00:10:59	00:11:02	But I think you know that.
162	00:11:06	00:11:08	Yeah, I'm done talking.
163	00:11:08	00:11:10	I didn't come here to talk, Nick.
164	00:11:10	00:11:12	I'm came to drag your ass back to work.
165	00:11:12	00:11:15	So, how many beers have you had exactly?
166	00:11:15	00:11:18	Mm... not enough.
167	00:11:20	00:11:23	Look, I already told you, Sara-- I quit.
168	00:11:23	00:11:25	Not tonight.
169	00:11:25	00:11:29	Tomorrow, you can do whatever you want.
170	00:11:45	00:11:47	This is usually the kind of place we shut down.
171	00:11:54	00:11:56	Oh, I'm-I'm good.
172	00:11:56	00:11:58	You're not on duty.
173	00:11:58	00:12:00	No.
174	00:12:00	00:12:02	Or are you?
175	00:12:09	00:12:11	I'm bored.
176	00:12:11	00:12:13	Thought you wanted to see how far this was going to go.
177	00:12:13	00:12:14	Yeah, where's it going to go?
178	00:12:14	00:12:17	Where is it going to go?
179	00:12:32	00:12:33	Let's go, guys.
180	00:12:38	00:12:40	Door at the end of the hall.
181	00:12:46	00:12:48	You gonna tell me what's behind the door?
182	00:12:50	00:12:52	Come on.
183	00:12:52	00:12:54	This is what you came for.
184	00:12:57	00:12:59	Isn't it?
185	00:13:02	00:13:04	If you were going to kill me, you would have done it already.
186	00:13:06	00:13:08	We could've had so much fun.
187	00:13:09	00:13:12	We still can.
188	00:13:12	00:13:14	Open the door.
189	00:13:20	00:13:21	Katie.
190	00:13:21	00:13:22	(Katie cries) You're late.
191	00:13:30	00:13:33	Are you sure you want to do this?
192	00:13:33	00:13:34	I have to.
193	00:13:45	00:13:47	I am going to kill him.
194	00:13:48	00:13:51	You said they would call.
195	00:13:52	00:13:54	D.B.?
196	00:13:57	00:13:59	You said they'd call.
197	00:13:59	00:14:01	They will.
198	00:14:03	00:14:05	I like that.
199	00:14:05	00:14:06	Is that a new painting?
200	00:14:06	00:14:09	I-I've been working on it for a few weeks.
201	00:14:09	00:14:12	I hadn't noticed.
202	00:14:12	00:14:14	I guess that's been happening a lot lately.
203	00:14:14	00:14:16	I'm sorry.
204	00:14:16	00:14:19	That's the view from our bedroom up in Seattle, right?
205	00:14:20	00:14:22	You miss it?
206	00:14:22	00:14:25	That's not a very good question to ask me right now.
207	00:14:25	00:14:26	I'm sorry, I don't know what...
208	00:14:31	00:14:34	The only thing worse than the thought of losing Katie is the thought of losing both of you.
209	00:14:34	00:14:37	That is not going to happen.
210	00:14:37	00:14:39	D.B.?
211	00:14:39	00:14:40	You hear from Finn?
212	00:14:40	00:14:42	No.
213	00:14:42	00:14:45	As you know, I got a text message from her a couple hours ago.
214	00:14:45	00:14:47	She was with Crenshaw, said she was onto something.
215	00:14:47	00:14:49	And she wanted me to follow her on the GPS.
216	00:14:49	00:14:50	We were tracking her toward downtown.
217	00:14:50	00:14:52	The signal went dead somewhere around Maryland Parkway.
218	00:14:52	00:14:53	Wait, what do you mean it went dead?
219	00:14:53	00:14:54	Crenshaw's got a jammer.
220	00:14:54	00:14:56	Why-Why would you do that?
221	00:14:56	00:14:58	Why would you leave her alone with some guy you know is dirty?
222	00:14:58	00:15:00	She wanted to be alone.
223	00:15:00	00:15:02	And there's no way that I could have seen this coming.
224	00:15:02	00:15:03	You know something -- you ought to...
225	00:15:03	00:15:05	Listen, look, look.
226	00:15:05	00:15:07	I think McKean has blindsided all of us on this one.
227	00:15:07	00:15:09	Radio call, sir.
228	00:15:09	00:15:13	Detective Crenshaw-- he's asking for CSI Russell.
229	00:15:13	00:15:16	Well, so much for a tracing a call.
230	00:15:22	00:15:23	This is Russell.
231	00:15:23	00:15:25	I got someone who wants to say hello.
232	00:15:28	00:15:29	Hey, it's me.
233	00:15:29	00:15:30	Where are you?
234	00:15:30	00:15:32	Uh, can't say, but I'm with Katie.
235	00:15:32	00:15:37	and she's okay.
236	00:15:37	00:15:38	Grandpa!
237	00:15:38	00:15:40	I'm scared.
238	00:15:40	00:15:41	Hey, Katie.
239	00:15:41	00:15:43	That was proof of life.
240	00:15:43	00:15:45	They said that if you want to see her again...
241	00:15:45	00:15:47	...you have to talk to McKeen.
242	00:15:47	00:15:49	Tell those sons of bitches if they lay a hand on...
243	00:15:52	00:15:54	This is okay. Where's McKeen?
244	00:15:54	00:15:57	He's in holding.
245	00:15:57	00:15:59	Now, this isn't just about McKeen's dead son.
246	00:15:59	00:16:00	His empire is crumbling.
247	00:16:00	00:16:01	He's burning the house down.
248	00:16:01	00:16:04	He's trying to take us all with it.
249	00:16:04	00:16:06	I'm sorry.
250	00:16:11	00:16:13	Did Sara give you some hairs to run?
251	00:16:13	00:16:15	Geez, what happened to your face?
252	00:16:15	00:16:16	The hairs, please.
253	00:16:16	00:16:18	Right.
254	00:16:18	00:16:21	Well, there were no tags, but DNA wouldn't help anyway.
255	00:16:21	00:16:26	'Cause I can tell you right now, they didn't come from any kidnapper.
256	00:16:26	00:16:27	I pulled exemplars for comparison.
257	00:16:27	00:16:29	Uh, hair's not human.
258	00:16:29	00:16:31	It's bovine.
259	00:16:31	00:16:35	Could still be transfer, brought in on this guy.
260	00:16:35	00:16:39	Maybe we're looking for some sort of dairy farm, or ranch.
261	00:16:39	00:16:41	Lots of those in the Central Valley.
262	00:16:41	00:16:44	Maybe Hodges can help you narrow it down.
263	00:16:44	00:16:45	I wish I had better news for you.
264	00:16:45	00:16:52	The white trace you found in the shoe impression and in Katie's bedroom is a composite of calcium hydroxide, gypsum and quartz.
265	00:16:52	00:16:53	Plaster.
266	00:16:53	00:16:54	Generic, at that.
267	00:16:54	00:16:56	Not exactly a game-changer.
268	00:16:56	00:17:00	Patrol found a car matching the description of one fleeing the scene where Ecklie was shot.
269	00:17:00	00:17:01	This was in the backseat.
270	00:17:01	00:17:03	Where's the car now?
271	00:17:03	00:17:04	It's in the garage.
272	00:17:04	00:17:06	Mandy's on it.
273	00:17:06	00:17:10	I'm going to process the gun and someone needs to go back to the hospital to pick up the pellets that were removed from Ecklie.
274	00:17:10	00:17:12	I'll go.
275	00:17:12	00:17:15	That's about all we can do for now.
276	00:17:15	00:17:16	Okay.
277	00:17:29	00:17:31	He's going to be okay.
278	00:17:31	00:17:35	That's good news.
279	00:17:35	00:17:38	I thought I lost him.
280	00:17:38	00:17:45	The whole time in the... in the waiting room, I kept thinking to myself, if he dies, it's my fault.
281	00:17:45	00:17:48	There's nothing you could've done.
282	00:17:48	00:17:51	That's not what I mean.
283	00:17:53	00:17:57	When I was a kid...
284	00:17:57	00:17:59	I was so angry at him.
285	00:17:59	00:18:03	Do you know how many times I prayed...
286	00:18:03	00:18:05	that he would get shot?
287	00:18:08	00:18:10	That's not your fault, either.
288	00:18:20	00:18:23	I'm sorry.
289	00:18:31	00:18:35	Where's your buddy Brass?
290	00:18:35	00:18:36	This is what you want, isn't it?
291	00:18:36	00:18:38	Maybe it's what you want.
292	00:18:38	00:18:39	I'm in no mood for games.
293	00:18:39	00:18:42	So there is a real cop in there somewhere.
294	00:18:42	00:18:44	That's good to know.
295	00:18:44	00:18:46	'Cause maybe then we can have an understanding.
296	00:18:46	00:18:48	What is it that you want?
297	00:18:48	00:18:50	You want to trade my granddaughter for your freedom?
298	00:18:50	00:18:51	Is that it?
299	00:18:51	00:18:54	Don't insult me, D.B.
300	00:18:54	00:18:55	That'll never be on the table.
301	00:18:57	00:18:59	You know, you CSIs, you're all the same.
302	00:18:59	00:19:06	You're-you're so busy with your black-lights and your little tweezers and your spray bottles.
303	00:19:08	00:19:10	Who do you think you're kidding with that thing?
304	00:19:10	00:19:13	What do you want?
305	00:19:13	00:19:14	What do I want?
306	00:19:15	00:19:17	What do I want?
307	00:19:17	00:19:23	You know, you were so obsessed with the how, that you never asked yourself the why-- Why Donny Price got popped.
308	00:19:23	00:19:26	Why Veronica Gilmore was beaten to death.
309	00:19:26	00:19:30	Why Jack Gilmore was innocently framed?
310	00:19:30	00:19:32	You're saying Jack Gilmore wasn't innocent?
311	00:19:32	00:19:38	I'm saying Jack Gilmore used his whore of a wife to steal $2 million in drug money from Donny Price.
312	00:19:38	00:19:40	From me.
313	00:19:40	00:19:42	Collateral for his stadium.
314	00:19:42	00:19:45	I want what's mine.
315	00:19:45	00:19:46	For my family.
316	00:19:46	00:19:49	You want me to get $2 million?
317	00:19:49	00:19:51	From Jack Gilmore?
318	00:19:51	00:19:54	You get me my money back and you get your granddaughter back.
319	00:19:54	00:19:56	You got 12 hours.
320	00:19:56	00:20:02	Now I got people waiting by a phone, and if they don't hear from me, well, eh...
321	00:20:06	00:20:08	I take care of your family, you take care of mine.
322	00:20:08	00:20:10	Is that it?
323	00:20:10	00:20:12	Karma.
324	00:20:21	00:20:23	Where's Grandpa?
325	00:20:23	00:20:24	Will he find us?
326	00:20:24	00:20:25	Aw, honey.
327	00:20:25	00:20:27	Don't worry.
328	00:20:27	00:20:29	I am going to bring you home to see him, okay?
329	00:20:29	00:20:30	And Grandma.
330	00:20:30	00:20:31	Mommy, too?
331	00:20:31	00:20:33	Of course you're going to see your mommy.
332	00:20:33	00:20:36	Okay, but until then, I really need you to be brave.
333	00:20:36	00:20:37	Okay.
334	00:20:37	00:20:39	Okay.
335	00:20:47	00:20:50	I'm scared.
336	00:20:50	00:20:54	Hey. I am going to go up there and look at that.
337	00:20:54	00:20:55	And you go sit down.
338	00:20:55	00:20:56	Okay.
339	00:21:19	00:21:22	How are you supposed to get Jack Gilmore to give you $2 million?
340	00:21:22	00:21:23	I have no idea.
341	00:21:23	00:21:25	Brass said the guy's dropped out of sight.
342	00:21:25	00:21:26	Vanished.
343	00:21:26	00:21:29	Probably hiding from McKeen, right?
344	00:21:29	00:21:30	Card's clean, no prints.
345	00:21:30	00:21:34	Tear it apart-- ink, card stock, paper, maybe it'll tell us where it came from.
346	00:21:34	00:21:36	And who put it together.
347	00:21:36	00:21:38	(phone rings) Yeah?
348	00:21:38	00:21:39	Maya just talked to Ryan.
349	00:21:39	00:21:41	His flight was canceled.
350	00:21:41	00:21:43	He's catching the next plane, but...
351	00:21:43	00:21:44	Well, she's hysterical.
352	00:21:44	00:21:46	She's asking for you.
353	00:21:46	00:21:47	All right, I-I'm on my way.
354	00:21:47	00:21:49	If you get anything, call me right away.
355	00:21:49	00:21:50	We're down to ten hours and counting.
356	00:22:20	00:22:22	McKeen's number one guy.
357	00:22:22	00:22:25	Kimball is definitely our kidnapper.
358	00:22:27	00:22:32	Well, the text and images on these letters looks like some sort of escort rag.
359	00:22:32	00:22:34	Like magazines you see on the streets downtown, right?
360	00:22:34	00:22:37	Advertisements for strip joints, sex clubs, brothels.
361	00:22:37	00:22:39	Yeah, but they all look the same.
362	00:22:39	00:22:41	Well, luckily, not to the micro-FTIR.
363	00:22:41	00:22:43	I ran the paper stock.
364	00:22:43	00:22:45	It's Zurvan Photo Select M-1.
365	00:22:45	00:22:47	Discontinued in '08.
366	00:22:47	00:22:49	Pretty specific.
367	00:22:49	00:22:52	According to the manufacturer, only one printing company in Vegas used it.
368	00:22:52	00:22:54	Place went out of business a couple months ago.
369	00:22:54	00:22:56	Who's using the old paper to print ads for hookers?
370	00:22:56	00:22:58	Maybe the new tenants.
371	00:22:58	00:22:59	A sex club called PD7.
372	00:22:59	00:23:01	Okay, honey, keep going.
373	00:23:01	00:23:02	I'm scared. I know.
374	00:23:02	00:23:03	It's okay.
375	00:23:03	00:23:04	You can do it. (loud banging)
376	00:23:04	00:23:06	What's that?
377	00:23:06	00:23:07	Hey!
378	00:23:07	00:23:09	What the hell? Open this damn door!
379	00:23:09	00:23:11	Katie, I need you to go now and I need you to go fast.
380	00:23:11	00:23:13	Go, sweetie, fast. I'll find you.
381	00:23:17	00:23:18	Kick it in.
382	00:23:24	00:23:25	What the hell?
383	00:23:25	00:23:27	I got the back, you take the front.
384	00:24:37	00:24:40	I told you we were going to have so much fun.
385	00:24:56	00:24:57	You okay?
386	00:24:57	00:24:59	Yeah, we've have to find Katie.
387	00:25:04	00:25:06	Oh! She's not in there.
388	00:25:06	00:25:08	(siren approaching) Where the hell is she?
389	00:25:08	00:25:11	Katie!
390	00:25:11	00:25:12	Katie!
391	00:25:19	00:25:20	I am sorry.
392	00:25:20	00:25:23	I just thought that if I could get her out-- I don't need you to think.
393	00:25:23	00:25:25	I need you to be smart, Finn.
394	00:25:25	00:25:28	Wh-Why would you let yourself get separated like that?
395	00:25:28	00:25:30	She's a child, for God's sake.
396	00:25:30	00:25:31	And now she's out there all by herself.
397	00:25:31	00:25:33	All right, all right, look.
398	00:25:33	00:25:36	There-There's four hours left on McKeen's deadline.
399	00:25:36	00:25:37	Get to the hospital.
400	00:25:37	00:25:38	Check yourself out.
401	00:25:38	00:25:39	And then go back to the lab.
402	00:25:39	00:25:41	I'm fine.
403	00:25:43	00:25:46	We will find her.
404	00:25:46	00:25:50	Please calm down and go and talk to your daughter.
405	00:25:50	00:25:52	We searched the building and the surrounding area.
406	00:25:52	00:25:54	No Katie.
407	00:25:54	00:25:55	Brass put a BOLO out on Kimball's car.
408	00:25:55	00:25:57	And your team's processing the club.
409	00:25:57	00:25:58	That's it.
410	00:25:58	00:26:01	Don't beat yourself up.
411	00:26:01	00:26:02	You found Katie.
412	00:26:02	00:26:04	I was supposed to bring her home.
413	00:26:04	00:26:05	You did what you could.
414	00:26:07	00:26:09	Thanks for saving my life.
415	00:26:12	00:26:14	You knew I would.
416	00:26:23	00:26:25	I was... (inhales)
417	00:26:25	00:26:30	so happy to have a moment to myself.
418	00:26:30	00:26:32	To let you read to her.
419	00:26:32	00:26:35	Put her to bed.
420	00:26:35	00:26:37	(sighs) And now...
421	00:26:37	00:26:38	Please don't do this to yourself.
422	00:26:38	00:26:40	Please don't.
423	00:26:40	00:26:44	When I was little, I always felt so safe.
424	00:26:44	00:26:47	You always made me feel so safe.
425	00:26:47	00:26:50	You said that no harm could come to us.
426	00:26:50	00:26:52	To our home.
427	00:26:52	00:26:56	This isn't our home.
428	00:26:56	00:26:57	What is this place?
429	00:26:57	00:26:58	I-I hate it.
430	00:26:58	00:27:00	Hey, hey, come on.
431	00:27:00	00:27:01	We can't give up hope, all right?
432	00:27:03	00:27:06	I know what happened.
433	00:27:06	00:27:08	When we were in Seattle.
434	00:27:08	00:27:10	The murders on campus.
435	00:27:10	00:27:14	You lied to me back then.
436	00:27:14	00:27:16	(Russell sighs) And now...
437	00:27:16	00:27:17	stop lying.
438	00:27:17	00:27:20	I was trying to protect us...
439	00:27:20	00:27:22	Stop lying.
440	00:27:42	00:27:43	Hey.
441	00:27:43	00:27:45	Hey.
442	00:27:45	00:27:46	You're okay.
443	00:27:46	00:27:48	Ah, thank God.
444	00:27:48	00:27:51	You're going to be okay, too.
445	00:27:51	00:27:53	Yeah?
446	00:27:53	00:27:57	It was McKeen, wasn't it?
447	00:27:57	00:27:59	Mm-hm.
448	00:28:01	00:28:04	He go after anybody else?
449	00:28:04	00:28:06	He, uh, got Russell's granddaughter.
450	00:28:06	00:28:07	They're looking for her now.
451	00:28:07	00:28:10	You can't worry about that.
452	00:28:10	00:28:12	You ha...
453	00:28:12	00:28:16	You have to get your rest and you have to get strong.
454	00:28:16	00:28:19	I'm glad you're here.
455	00:28:19	00:28:21	I love you, M.
456	00:28:25	00:28:28	I love you too, Dad.
457	00:28:53	00:28:55	So you followed the evidence...
458	00:28:55	00:28:57	but you didn't get her back.
459	00:29:02	00:29:04	Where is she?
460	00:29:04	00:29:06	It's not going to be that easy, D.B.
461	00:29:06	00:29:08	Where?
462	00:29:08	00:29:12	You didn't really think I was going to give her back to you alive, did you?
463	00:29:15	00:29:18	Ah, that's what I thought.
464	00:29:18	00:29:21	Just like Stokes.
465	00:29:29	00:29:31	That's a good kill.
466	00:29:32	00:29:33	Don't worry, I got your back.
467	00:29:33	00:29:36	Russell?
468	00:29:36	00:29:40	Hey, Russell.
469	00:29:40	00:29:42	Where are we?
470	00:29:42	00:29:46	Uh, Sara found more plaster and bovine hair in Crenshaw's car.
471	00:29:46	00:29:48	Well, what good is that?
472	00:29:48	00:29:52	I mean, we're already speculating that these guys are spending time at a ranch or a farm somewhere.
473	00:29:52	00:29:55	Not just somewhere. Right there.
474	00:29:55	00:29:56	Found a fungus in Crenshaw's lungs.
475	00:29:56	00:29:59	Coccidioides Immitis.
476	00:29:59	00:30:01	Causes Valley Fever.
477	00:30:01	00:30:03	There's been a cluster of cases reported in that area.
478	00:30:03	00:30:07	This is like 40 square miles of desert.
479	00:30:07	00:30:09	I mean, how the hell are we supposed to...
480	00:30:09	00:30:11	We have one hour left on McKeen's deadline.
481	00:30:11	00:30:13	One hour.
482	00:30:13	00:30:17	That is, if-if Finn's botched attempt to rescue Katie hasn't gotten her killed already.
483	00:30:17	00:30:21	So, if she's alive, cow hair and Valley Fever are not going to bring her home.
484	00:30:21	00:30:24	Bring me something that can, will you, please?
485	00:30:24	00:30:26	Go!
486	00:30:31	00:30:34	Hey. How's Maya?
487	00:30:36	00:30:37	I'm gonna have to call you back.
488	00:30:37	00:30:39	Are you deaf?
489	00:30:39	00:30:41	Or is this you quitting again?
490	00:30:48	00:30:50	You got something you want to say?
491	00:30:50	00:30:56	After Jack Gilmore's wife was murdered, Finlay got a warrant from Brass for his phone.
492	00:30:56	00:30:57	It's still active.
493	00:30:57	00:30:59	And he's still making phone calls.
494	00:30:59	00:31:04	Everybody is looking for Jack Gilmore.
495	00:31:04	00:31:05	I know where to find him.
496	00:31:29	00:31:31	Hey, Jack.
497	00:31:31	00:31:33	Hey, you want to tell me what the hell this is about?
498	00:31:33	00:31:39	McKeen told me about the $2 million in drug money that you had your wife steal from Donny Price.
499	00:31:39	00:31:43	That's why McKeen had them killed and you kept your mouth shut, even when he tried to frame you.
500	00:31:43	00:31:46	He wants his money back. I-I-I don't know what you're talking about.
501	00:31:46	00:31:47	I don't have much time.
502	00:31:47	00:31:49	(scoffs) Come on, man.
503	00:31:49	00:31:50	Who you kidding?
504	00:31:50	00:31:52	You're not going to shoot me.
505	00:31:52	00:31:53	You're the good cop.
506	00:31:53	00:31:54	I'm not.
507	00:31:54	00:31:56	I quit last night.
508	00:31:56	00:31:59	All right, guys, look... you're a little late, okay?
509	00:31:59	00:32:02	What does that mean-- late? That means that I already gave McKeen the money.
510	00:32:02	00:32:04	Hey, I swear to God.
511	00:32:04	00:32:06	My lawyer made the drop. Ask him.
512	00:32:08	00:32:14	You didn't think two million bucks was going to get your granddaughter back from a guy like McKeen, did ya?
513	00:32:17	00:32:19	She's dead.
514	00:32:30	00:32:34	David-64, secured rooftop of adjacent building.
515	00:32:34	00:32:35	What the hell were you thinking?
516	00:32:35	00:32:36	You lied to me.
517	00:32:36	00:32:38	I didn't lie to you.
518	00:32:38	00:32:40	You told me that Gilmore was nowhere to be found.
519	00:32:40	00:32:43	We found him with your warrant, so you knew where he was the whole time, right?
520	00:32:43	00:32:44	Stokes, shut up.
521	00:32:44	00:32:45	Yeah, that's right.
522	00:32:45	00:32:51	Gilmore was a material witness in an ongoing police corruption investigation.
523	00:32:51	00:32:55	Which, by the way, you completely screwed up by going going full cowboy on some scheme to extort drug money for ransom.
524	00:32:55	00:32:57	No, no, listen to me.
525	00:32:57	00:32:58	We're talking about my granddaughter.
526	00:32:58	00:33:00	What, you think don't understand that?
527	00:33:00	00:33:01	No, I don't.
528	00:33:01	00:33:03	You're not behaving that way.
529	00:33:03	00:33:04	Hey, you know what?
530	00:33:04	00:33:07	Look, when you processed your own house, I didn't say anything.
531	00:33:07	00:33:10	When you walked into McKeen's cell by yourself, I didn't stop you.
532	00:33:10	00:33:11	You want to know why I didn't tell you where Gilmore was?
533	00:33:11	00:33:13	Because I knew it would end up exactly like this.
534	00:33:13	00:33:14	Look, don't you get it?
535	00:33:14	00:33:16	McKeen knew he was going to get his money.
536	00:33:16	00:33:18	The only thing he couldn't get was Gilmore.
537	00:33:18	00:33:20	He needed you to find him.
538	00:33:20	00:33:22	So...
539	00:33:23	00:33:26	D.B., go home.
540	00:33:28	00:33:30	Be with your family.
541	00:33:30	00:33:33	Get some CSIs here.
542	00:33:42	00:33:44	Hey.
543	00:33:46	00:33:48	Barbara called you, huh?
544	00:33:48	00:33:50	Yeah, I can see why.
545	00:33:50	00:33:52	You're lying in Katie's bed in case files.
546	00:33:52	00:33:54	She's really worried about you.
547	00:33:54	00:33:56	I can't believe how wrong I've been.
548	00:33:56	00:34:03	I mean, this whole time, willing myself to believe that she's still alive when the facts say so clearly that she is.
549	00:34:04	00:34:05	I'm, I'm not losing it.
550	00:34:05	00:34:08	Just... listen to this.
551	00:34:08	00:34:11	Yes, Katie should be dead, but so should you.
552	00:34:11	00:34:16	After proof of life, they didn't need you, but they kept you both alive. Why?
553	00:34:16	00:34:23	In your case, 'cause Crenshaw is a scumbag and he wanted something more than just your life, but, but Katie-- Kimball didn't just see a hostage.
554	00:34:23	00:34:24	He saw a child.
555	00:34:24	00:34:26	I mean, look at this, the guy is divorced, right?
556	00:34:26	00:34:28	He's got three kids.
557	00:34:28	00:34:36	Th-The youngest one is like this 7√-year-old little girl, same age as Katie. Okay, so, going with that, why would Kimball still be in town?
558	00:34:36	00:34:38	Out of loyalty, right?
559	00:34:38	00:34:41	He wanted to do one last job for McKeen.
560	00:34:41	00:34:43	Deliver the $2 million to the family. Right.
561	00:34:43	00:34:45	But with the heat on, how does he do that?
562	00:34:45	00:34:49	I don't know, I don't-- that's the part I don't know, but I don't think he does either.
563	00:34:49	00:34:54	You know, maybe he's, maybe he's laying low until he can figure out what to do, but I do know he's out there and so's Katie.
564	00:34:54	00:35:00	We have 40 square miles of desert and all we have is cow hair and plaster.
565	00:35:00	00:35:02	I know, I know.
566	00:35:02	00:35:03	Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
567	00:35:03	00:35:05	I can't believe it. What?
568	00:35:05	00:35:06	What? I didn't even see that.
569	00:35:06	00:35:08	Damn it!
570	00:35:08	00:35:09	D.B.!
571	00:35:09	00:35:11	Look at that. See that?
572	00:35:11	00:35:15	It's not, it's not hair and plaster, it's hair in plaster.
573	00:35:15	00:35:20	Before World War II, they used to use animal hair in plaster as, as a binding agent or something.
574	00:35:20	00:35:23	There can't be that many houses out there from that era still standing in the desert.
575	00:35:23	00:35:27	You're right, I've got the county assessor records in front of me now.
576	00:35:27	00:35:29	Nine properties fit the description.
577	00:35:29	00:35:31	Any of them have a connection to McKeen?
578	00:35:31	00:35:33	I'm going through the deeds-- nothing so far.
579	00:35:33	00:35:37	I found a cartridge case on the rooftop across from where Gilmore was shot.
580	00:35:37	00:35:38	It's a .223.
581	00:35:38	00:35:40	Matches the bullet that killed him.
582	00:35:40	00:35:41	Tell me you got a print.
583	00:35:41	00:35:45	I did, and a hit-- an ex-cop named Earl Whitson.
584	00:35:45	00:35:47	He, uh, grew up with McKeen.
585	00:35:47	00:35:50	Actually, McKeen is the godfather to his daughter.
586	00:35:50	00:35:51	I checked cell phone records.
587	00:35:51	00:35:54	He was in the vicinity last night, when Ecklie was shot.
588	00:35:54	00:35:56	That can't be a coincidence.
589	00:35:56	00:35:57	It's not-- because Mm-mm.
590	00:35:57	00:36:02	I have a Mary Whitson at 21525 Sage Willow Road, off Highway 26.
591	00:36:02	00:36:05	Call Brass.
592	00:36:16	00:36:18	We have a deal.
593	00:36:19	00:36:21	Let's go.
594	00:36:32	00:36:33	Earl Whitson.
595	00:36:33	00:36:35	Yeah, retired cop.
596	00:36:35	00:36:39	Dave Beck... Dennis Melky.
597	00:36:39	00:36:40	Both worked Vice with Kimball.
598	00:36:40	00:36:43	Hmm, probably worked for McKeen, too.
599	00:36:43	00:36:45	Kimball is obviously tying up loose ends.
600	00:36:45	00:36:46	It's all clear.
601	00:36:46	00:36:48	Didn't find the girl. (tires screeching)
602	00:36:48	00:36:51	Suspect sighted-- rear of the house.
603	00:36:51	00:36:52	Vehicle on the move.
604	00:36:56	00:36:58	Hold it right there.
605	00:36:59	00:37:01	Drop the gun now.
606	00:37:01	00:37:03	Give it up, Paul.
607	00:37:03	00:37:07	Gave up everything a long time ago, when I got in bed with McKeen.
608	00:37:07	00:37:09	Come on, there's still time to make some of it right.
609	00:37:12	00:37:14	I'm a lot of things.
610	00:37:16	00:37:18	But not a rat.
611	00:37:28	00:37:30	Where is she?
612	00:37:30	00:37:32	Should have let me die.
613	00:37:32	00:37:34	Where's the girl?
614	00:37:36	00:37:39	She's here.
615	00:38:04	00:38:05	Oh, God.
616	00:38:19	00:38:22	(gasps) The man told me to hide.
617	00:38:22	00:38:25	I cut my hand.
618	00:39:18	00:39:20	It's time to go home, boys.
619	00:39:20	00:39:24	Actually, McKeen, your bus isn't going back to Ely.
620	00:39:24	00:39:34	See, I made a humanitarian phone call to the governor, reminding him how hard it is for a cop to, to survive in general population.
621	00:39:34	00:39:35	Where?
622	00:39:35	00:39:46	Federal facility, Indiana, and for your own safety you will be in isolation for the rest of your life.
623	00:39:46	00:39:54	Oh, yeah, and the, um, that $2 million-- that was donated to the crime lab in your family's name.
624	00:39:56	00:39:57	You have a nice trip.
625	00:40:00	00:40:04	A promising development tonight in the corruption investigation of the LVPD.
626	00:40:04	00:40:13	Detective Paul Kimball is cooperating with the D.A.'s Office and arrests were made today of more officers linked to the former Undersheriff Jeffrey McKeen.
627	00:40:13	00:40:19	The commission report is due out-- Sounds like the LVPD is making a comeback.
628	00:40:20	00:40:22	How about you, Nick?
629	00:40:23	00:40:25	What about me?
630	00:40:27	00:40:30	I don't know; I haven't talked to Russell yet.
631	00:40:30	00:40:33	This isn't about Russell.
632	00:40:33	00:40:34	Words have consequences, you know.
633	00:40:34	00:40:38	I mean, if you say you quit, you need to mean it.
634	00:40:38	00:40:41	You quit. Well, yeah, but I didn't say it out loud.
635	00:40:41	00:40:45	I left a note at Reception for Grissom and I walked right on out of here.
636	00:40:45	00:40:47	And you're still here, so don't preach to me about integrity.
637	00:40:47	00:40:49	Okay? Wait a minute.
638	00:40:49	00:40:50	I am not preaching to you about integrity.
639	00:40:50	00:40:52	Kind of are a little bit, don't you think?
640	00:40:52	00:40:57	I went away for a while and I got my head together. You got a lot of nerve to talk to me about quitting, you really do.
641	00:40:57	00:40:59	All right, all right, all right, all right.
642	00:40:59	00:41:01	This is not how family treats each other.
643	00:41:03	00:41:12	Actually it is, but we are also a team, and that means that we have to trust that we have each other's back, no matter what.
644	00:41:13	00:41:18	So are you in or are you out?
645	00:41:29	00:41:30	You shouldn't be looking at those.
646	00:41:32	00:41:34	Why?
647	00:41:34	00:41:36	This is our life, isn't it?
648	00:41:36	00:41:38	That's not fair.
649	00:41:38	00:41:41	I can't live like this anymore.
650	00:41:41	00:41:44	What do you mean?
651	00:41:44	00:41:48	Oh, Barbara, don't do this, please.
652	00:41:48	00:41:50	I'm gonna head out.
653	00:41:51	00:41:58	D.B., D.B.-- Are you okay?
654	00:41:58	00:41:59	Yeah, yeah.
655	00:41:59	00:42:01	Sorry.
656	00:42:01	00:42:03	No, it's all good.
657	00:42:07	00:42:09	Jules, are you gonna stay for dinner?
658	00:42:09	00:42:10	Oh, I'd love to.
659	00:42:10	00:42:12	Great. Thank you.
660	00:42:12	00:42:15	Honey, will you come help me in the kitchen?
661	00:42:15	00:42:16	I can help.
662	00:42:16	00:42:18	No, no, I got it.
663	00:42:20	00:42:22	Hey, come here, come here.
