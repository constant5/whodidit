0	00:00:03	00:00:06	Come on!
1	00:00:39	00:00:41	So nice to see Black Sabbath again.
2	00:00:41	00:00:44	Saw them in '78 at the Spectrum in Philly.
3	00:00:46	00:00:50	Around the same time I saw the Dead at the Winterland Ballroom.
4	00:00:50	00:00:52	Little bit of a different vibe.
5	00:01:08	00:01:11	You sure this is where we're supposed to meet the guy?
6	00:01:11	00:01:13	Backstage, man, after the show.
7	00:01:13	00:01:15	I still think it's a bad idea.
8	00:01:15	00:01:18	Look, this reporter's just gonna follow you around for a few days.
9	00:01:18	00:01:19	He gets his story. We all go home.
10	00:01:19	00:01:20	Mayor's happy, all right?
11	00:01:20	00:01:22	A little positive PR wouldn't hurt.
12	00:01:22	00:01:23	What?
13	00:01:23	00:01:25	I said a little... (chuckles)
14	00:01:44	00:01:46	Come on!
15	00:01:58	00:02:01	So, Ozzy, another incredible gig.
16	00:02:01	00:02:03	The new album is entitled 13, am I right?
17	00:02:03	00:02:05	That's-that's correct.
18	00:02:05	00:02:09	The album's kind of like a... a modern sound, but there's no denying it's a Black Sabbath album.
19	00:02:09	00:02:11	Still got the Black Sabbath vibe, you know?
20	00:02:11	00:02:13	Listen, I think we got it. Thank you so much. Thank you. Nice one.
21	00:02:13	00:02:18	I'm sure you don't remember this, but you were actually my first interview ever. I was?
22	00:02:18	00:02:19	The Ultimate Sin Tour, 1986.
23	00:02:19	00:02:22	Really? I-I don't remember.
24	00:02:22	00:02:23	The concert or me?
25	00:02:23	00:02:25	I don't remember 1986. (chuckles)
26	00:02:25	00:02:26	Really great to meet you.
27	00:02:26	00:02:28	Thanks for you time again. You're very welcome.
28	00:02:28	00:02:29	Best of luck with of the tour. All right, thank you.
29	00:02:29	00:02:32	Sheriff Ecklie, good to see you.
30	00:02:32	00:02:33	John Merchiston, Savoir magazine.
31	00:02:33	00:02:35	D.B. Russell, CSI.
32	00:02:35	00:02:36	It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
33	00:02:36	00:02:41	I was reading up about your exploits in Seattle catching the Gig Harbor Killer. Real thriller.
34	00:02:41	00:02:45	I'm not sure that three days with us will, uh, reach that same level of thrills.
35	00:02:45	00:02:48	I sense a certain reluctance on your part.
36	00:02:48	00:02:50	I just don't see the value, to be honest, you know.
37	00:02:50	00:02:53	Another story about cops. Hardly cops, are you?
38	00:02:53	00:02:55	I mean, you're the, uh, nation's number one crime lab.
39	00:02:55	00:02:58	Sworn to uphold the law in the land of the lawless.
40	00:02:58	00:02:59	I-I've got a working title, actually. (cell phone ringing)
41	00:02:59	00:03:03	It's, uh, Police as Paradox in Sin City.
42	00:03:03	00:03:05	There's your positive PR for you. Yes.
43	00:03:05	00:03:06	Um, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to go.
44	00:03:06	00:03:07	I got a 419.
45	00:03:07	00:03:09	Dead body.
46	00:03:09	00:03:11	Sounds like we're off to a good start.
47	00:03:11	00:03:13	Okay, all right. Go get your stuff.
48	00:03:13	00:03:16	You just signed yourself up for the grave shift.
49	00:03:17	00:03:19	What the hell is this place?
50	00:03:19	00:03:21	These are porn stages.
51	00:03:21	00:03:22	Used by a local production company.
52	00:03:22	00:03:24	They're currently out of town.
53	00:03:24	00:03:26	I assume you've met...
54	00:03:26	00:03:29	Yes. Mr. Merchiston and I went over the ground rules, right?
55	00:03:29	00:03:31	I brought my own latex.
56	00:03:31	00:03:32	Yeah, now you don't touch anything. Clear?
57	00:03:32	00:03:36	You know, I did a piece on Scotland Yard, so I had to pass their forensic field training.
58	00:03:36	00:03:37	Impressive, Sherlock.
59	00:03:37	00:03:40	Keep your hands in your pocket.
60	00:03:40	00:03:42	Welcome to the Love Motel.
61	00:03:44	00:03:46	New partner, Jim?
62	00:03:46	00:03:49	Oh, uh, John Merchiston, this is, uh, CSI Julie Finlay.
63	00:03:49	00:03:53	Mr. Merchiston's a reporter, and he's embedded with us for a few days.
64	00:03:53	00:03:54	All right, fill me in.
65	00:03:54	00:03:56	Jane Doe. Mummified body.
66	00:03:56	00:03:59	So, she's been here at least a couple of months.
67	00:03:59	00:04:03	You'd think so, but according to the owner of this fine establishment, not so.
68	00:04:03	00:04:04	What do you mean?
69	00:04:04	00:04:08	Production on Lambskin Linings Playbook ended Monday.
70	00:04:08	00:04:11	The company, uh, picked up, went to an adult convention in Miami.
71	00:04:11	00:04:13	The place has been locked up for 48 hours.
72	00:04:13	00:04:15	At least until it was broken into this morning.
73	00:04:15	00:04:17	Skin under the neck is opened up.
74	00:04:17	00:04:18	You can see the hyoid bone.
75	00:04:18	00:04:21	It's broken. So she was strangled.
76	00:04:21	00:04:23	What is that? (sniffs)
77	00:04:23	00:04:26	That sweet, flowery smell-- what is that?
78	00:04:26	00:04:28	Well, obviously, you guys don't hang out in strip clubs.
79	00:04:28	00:04:32	Yeah, I-I thing it's called Honeysuckle, um...
80	00:04:32	00:04:33	Honeysuckle something. What's it called?
81	00:04:33	00:04:35	Honeysuckle... Summer.
82	00:04:35	00:04:36	Honeysuckle Summer.
83	00:04:36	00:04:37	That's it.
84	00:04:37	00:04:38	Personal experience?
85	00:04:38	00:04:40	I never reveal a source.
86	00:04:40	00:04:44	It's odd, though, isn't it, that there's this new stripper smell on an old stripper body?
87	00:04:44	00:04:45	That's not all that's new.
88	00:04:45	00:04:48	Lingerie still has the price tag on it.
89	00:04:48	00:04:52	Okay, all right, so maybe she was a stripper, maybe she wasn't.
90	00:04:52	00:04:59	Either way, killer strangles her, mummifies the body, breaks in, stages her to look like a porn star.
91	00:04:59	00:05:02	Yeah, trying to give us all a show.
92	00:05:36	00:05:38	So, all this work, what do you think the message is?
93	00:05:38	00:05:41	Could be a twisted vendetta against the porn company.
94	00:05:41	00:05:46	Brass is running down all the employees past and present.
95	00:05:46	00:05:49	Attention to detail, all the way down to the Bible on the nightstand.
96	00:05:49	00:05:52	Could be our killer's obsessed with sin.
97	00:06:01	00:06:04	What is that?
98	00:06:04	00:06:06	I don't know.
99	00:06:06	00:06:09	Bunch of zeroes carved on it.
100	00:06:09	00:06:11	It opens.
101	00:06:14	00:06:17	That is a black widow.
102	00:06:17	00:06:20	That's the Steatoda grossa. That's the false black widow.
103	00:06:20	00:06:22	Harmless. Says you.
104	00:06:22	00:06:25	Beware of killers bearing gifts.
105	00:06:28	00:06:34	If we can restore her prints or extract DNA, maybe we can get an I.D.
106	00:06:34	00:06:36	Of course, there's no guarantee she'll be in the system.
107	00:06:36	00:06:39	Could be we'd have more luck if we restore her face.
108	00:06:39	00:06:42	Oh, it's a little late for that, Doc.
109	00:06:42	00:06:43	Not necessarily.
110	00:06:43	00:06:45	You're thinking Dr. Stevens.
111	00:06:45	00:06:47	Who's Dr. Stevens?
112	00:06:47	00:06:52	He's developed rehydrating techniques to identify bodies found in desert environments.
113	00:06:52	00:06:58	The process, it not only restores the skin, but it restores the vital organs, everything.
114	00:06:58	00:07:01	We can do a full autopsy.
115	00:07:01	00:07:02	There's just one problem.
116	00:07:02	00:07:04	And what's that?
117	00:07:04	00:07:07	There's always a risk the process could destroy additional evidence.
118	00:07:07	00:07:09	Well, right now, getting an I.D.
119	00:07:09	00:07:11	is our best shot at catching this killer.
120	00:07:11	00:07:14	I agree. I'll run the bath.
121	00:07:45	00:07:48	Doc really pulled off a miracle.
122	00:07:48	00:07:49	He gave us a face?
123	00:07:49	00:07:51	Yeah, but we still don't have any I.D.
124	00:07:51	00:07:53	Facial recognition in Missing Persons came up empty.
125	00:07:53	00:07:55	What about her DNA?
126	00:07:55	00:07:58	Same story. Nothing in CODIS.
127	00:07:58	00:08:01	Well, maybe if we go public with her photo, someone will recognize her. It's worth a shot.
128	00:08:01	00:08:04	Hey, M. Hey. Look what Doc found during autopsy...
129	00:08:04	00:08:06	inside her chest cavity.
130	00:08:06	00:08:10	Killer inserted it inside her mummified heart.
131	00:08:10	00:08:12	Gold charm?
132	00:08:12	00:08:14	Hooker with a heart of gold.
133	00:08:14	00:08:15	Someone's got a sick sense of humor.
134	00:08:15	00:08:17	Get it to Hodges. Thank you.
135	00:08:17	00:08:18	Shall do.
136	00:08:18	00:08:21	Bye, Dad. All right, see you.
137	00:08:21	00:08:24	Oh, how goes it with Mr. Savoir Magazine?
138	00:08:24	00:08:29	He's a bit of an ass, but the longer he's with us, the more of that positive PR you'll get.
139	00:08:30	00:08:32	What's your expert opinion on this, uh...
140	00:08:32	00:08:37	on this little trinket that the killer left behind?
141	00:08:37	00:08:38	I don't know, man.
142	00:08:38	00:08:40	The, uh, numbers could mean something.
143	00:08:40	00:08:42	They could be symbols, couldn't they?
144	00:08:42	00:08:44	I just got back from Luxor.
145	00:08:45	00:08:47	The one in Egypt.
146	00:08:47	00:08:51	I was doing an article on the tourist trade there, or the lack thereof.
147	00:08:51	00:08:53	I don't know. Hieroglyphics are just in my mind right now.
148	00:08:53	00:08:55	Hieroglyphics, symbols, you know.
149	00:08:55	00:08:56	Right.
150	00:08:56	00:08:59	Do you mind if I touch this one?
151	00:08:59	00:09:00	No, go ahead. Thanks.
152	00:09:02	00:09:06	The spider's definitely a dramatic touch, wouldn't you say?
153	00:09:06	00:09:08	That's the pill bug you're smelling.
154	00:09:08	00:09:11	It emits a chemical to deter predators.
155	00:09:11	00:09:16	It's impressive, your, uh... your knowledge of entomology.
156	00:09:16	00:09:18	I had a good teacher.
157	00:09:20	00:09:25	Going public with the photo of our victim really paid off. You remember Miss Kitty?
158	00:09:25	00:09:26	She recognize the victim?
159	00:09:26	00:09:29	She only wants to talk to you, so...
160	00:09:29	00:09:30	Hey.
161	00:09:30	00:09:32	Miss Kitty, nice to see you again.
162	00:09:32	00:09:34	You, too.
163	00:09:34	00:09:36	Oh, and it's not Miss Kitty anymore.
164	00:09:36	00:09:39	I don't use my street name. I use my real name now.
165	00:09:39	00:09:40	Angela Banner.
166	00:09:40	00:09:41	Said you're out of the game now, right?
167	00:09:41	00:09:43	Yes, and that's why I know Megan.
168	00:09:43	00:09:44	She's the girl that was killed?
169	00:09:44	00:09:45	Megan Ramirez. She was a stripper.
170	00:09:45	00:09:47	Did porn on the side.
171	00:09:47	00:09:52	Like me, she wanted out. And I was helping her through the Fellowship of Fallen Angels.
172	00:09:52	00:09:53	Oh, the stripper church downtown?
173	00:09:53	00:09:55	Brother Larson's ministry.
174	00:09:55	00:09:56	Brother Larson.
175	00:09:56	00:09:58	We're working to save girls like Megan.
176	00:09:58	00:10:00	Now, when was the last time you saw her?
177	00:10:00	00:10:03	Two months ago at a support meeting. And then she just...
178	00:10:03	00:10:05	disappeared.
179	00:10:05	00:10:06	But that's not all.
180	00:10:06	00:10:09	Since then, all of these girls have disappeared.
181	00:10:09	00:10:15	They haven't come to counseling, to meetings, to fellowship suppers. And you know they got to eat.
182	00:10:15	00:10:20	In spite of your valiant efforts to save these girls, some of them may not want to be saved.
183	00:10:20	00:10:23	If they had any doubt, they would've come to me or Brother Larson.
184	00:10:23	00:10:24	They wouldn't just up and leave.
185	00:10:24	00:10:27	Y'all have to do something so that these girls don't end up like Megan.
186	00:10:27	00:10:28	Excuse me.
187	00:10:32	00:10:34	Look, Nancy, that's all I know right now.
188	00:10:34	00:10:37	No, I mean, it's... I don't have any more information.
189	00:10:37	00:10:39	No, you don't have to do that.
190	00:10:39	00:10:40	All right.
191	00:10:42	00:10:46	I got to run. Okay, bye-bye. Bye.
192	00:10:46	00:10:50	Your daughter Ellie is one of the girls who may be missing. I'm so sorry.
193	00:10:50	00:10:53	Well, you know, I had to call my ex-wife Nancy, tell her that, you know, Ellie's in Vegas.
194	00:10:53	00:10:56	Left out the real trouble that she might be in.
195	00:10:56	00:10:57	Nancy's flying out?
196	00:10:57	00:10:59	Yeah, tonight.
197	00:10:59	00:11:02	You know, ever since Ellie's been in Vegas, I've been trying to track her down.
198	00:11:02	00:11:04	Just to reach out, connect, you know?
199	00:11:04	00:11:08	When I saw that picture, I mean, it was like a stab in my heart.
200	00:11:08	00:11:12	Okay, look, you said yourself, we don't know for sure that something's happened to these girls.
201	00:11:12	00:11:14	But we know what happened to one of them.
202	00:11:14	00:11:16	All right, look, we-we have this information.
203	00:11:16	00:11:18	We'll get it out to everybody.
204	00:11:18	00:11:23	Now, if Angela's right and these girls are in danger, we'll find them.
205	00:11:23	00:11:28	I called as soon as the hospital received a missing persons photo from your office.
206	00:11:28	00:11:30	So, you say her name is Teresa Hill?
207	00:11:30	00:11:31	Mm-hmm.
208	00:11:31	00:11:32	It's nice to finally have her name.
209	00:11:32	00:11:34	Oh, so she came in as a Jane Doe?
210	00:11:34	00:11:36	Two weeks ago. Been here ever since.
211	00:11:36	00:11:41	She was found in the alley behind the motel, strangled and left for dead.
212	00:11:41	00:11:45	Well, I'm sure she's been processed, but I'm gonna need to examine her on my own.
213	00:11:45	00:11:46	I understand; do what you need to do.
214	00:11:46	00:11:47	Okay, thanks. Mm-hmm.
215	00:11:55	00:11:57	Hey. Hey.
216	00:11:58	00:12:00	That from the evidence locker?
217	00:12:00	00:12:02	Personal items.
218	00:12:02	00:12:04	Day shift collected them when they were processing her.
219	00:12:04	00:12:09	According to Angela, Teresa advertised online.
220	00:12:09	00:12:14	Her angle was that she claimed to be a virgin, auctioning off her virtue.
221	00:12:16	00:12:18	Typical hooker stuff.
222	00:12:18	00:12:20	Condoms, lipstick...
223	00:12:25	00:12:27	What is it?
224	00:12:27	00:12:28	Charm bracelet...
225	00:12:28	00:12:33	with a gold heart pendant, just like the one Doc took out of Megan Ramirez.
226	00:12:34	00:12:37	There are no coincidences, right?
227	00:12:41	00:12:45	It's Nick; he's following up on one of our missing girls, Chloe Rudolph.
228	00:12:45	00:12:47	They find her? Yeah.
229	00:12:47	00:12:50	Like you said, no coincidences.
230	00:12:58	00:13:01	Whoa, you sure weren't kidding.
231	00:13:01	00:13:05	How long do you think she's been like this? About 12 hours, I guess.
232	00:13:05	00:13:07	She seems to be in full rigor.
233	00:13:07	00:13:13	You know, Angela Banner's file said that Chloe Rudolph here worked for a food fetish porn site.
234	00:13:13	00:13:16	People paid to watch her eat.
235	00:13:16	00:13:19	The, uh, camera went live about an hour ago.
236	00:13:19	00:13:23	That's when the calls started coming in, and the ISP traced it back to this address.
237	00:13:23	00:13:25	This her place?
238	00:13:25	00:13:26	No, it's her boyfriend's.
239	00:13:26	00:13:30	And where is he? He's in the freezer, chilling with the ice cream.
240	00:13:43	00:13:47	(freezer closes) Well, boyfriend's C.O.D. is obvious.
241	00:13:47	00:13:49	What about hers?
242	00:13:49	00:13:57	Well, petechial hemorrhaging suggests that she choked on dessert, but that's not your typical chocolate.
243	00:13:57	00:13:59	Schistocerca gregaria.
244	00:14:00	00:14:02	Chocolate-covered locust.
245	00:14:02	00:14:05	Just when you thought it couldn't get any sicker.
246	00:14:15	00:14:17	Wonder if there's a spider inside.
247	00:14:19	00:14:21	Not this time.
248	00:14:22	00:14:25	Well, that's three bodies now, Greg.
249	00:14:25	00:14:27	And another one clinging to life in the hospital.
250	00:14:27	00:14:30	We got ourselves a serial.
251	00:14:34	00:14:37	I don't think we're looking at death by chocolate.
252	00:14:37	00:14:38	Hyoid bone's broken.
253	00:14:38	00:14:40	She was strangled.
254	00:14:40	00:14:43	M.O.'s with the female victims is consistent.
255	00:14:43	00:14:46	As are other elements of the killer's signature.
256	00:14:46	00:14:50	I did notice this odd pattern of abrasions on her back.
257	00:14:55	00:14:58	That's disturbing.
258	00:14:58	00:15:02	Thou shalt not bear false witness.
259	00:15:02	00:15:03	That's from the Ten Commandments, right?
260	00:15:03	00:15:05	Number nine, I think.
261	00:15:05	00:15:06	The lettering is so defined.
262	00:15:08	00:15:18	To do something like this, you'd have to create the bruises under the skin right around the time of death, knowing that they'd only be visible during autopsy.
263	00:15:18	00:15:19	He wanted us to see this.
264	00:15:19	00:15:22	Here, now.
265	00:15:22	00:15:23	Talk about a signature.
266	00:15:23	00:15:27	Religious references, Bibles, wooden...
267	00:15:27	00:15:30	whatever the hell these are, bugs, gold hearts...
268	00:15:30	00:15:32	Yeah, usually a killer has one signature.
269	00:15:32	00:15:34	This guy is all over the page.
270	00:15:34	00:15:36	He doesn't seem to have a specific type, either.
271	00:15:36	00:15:37	I mean, he's even killed a guy now, right?
272	00:15:37	00:15:39	A pimp.
273	00:15:39	00:15:46	All right, so based on what Angela told us, the seven girls who seem to have gone missing all disappeared around the same time.
274	00:15:46	00:15:48	Eight weeks ago.
275	00:15:48	00:15:51	Now the guy's dropping bodies on his own time table.
276	00:15:51	00:15:55	Two weeks ago, Teresa Hill is found strangled, survives.
277	00:15:55	00:15:59	Last night, Megan Ramirez is found dead on a porn stage.
278	00:15:59	00:16:03	This afternoon, Chloe Rudolph dead with her pimp in the kitchen.
279	00:16:03	00:16:04	In flagrante delicto.
280	00:16:05	00:16:07	Death by chocolate.
281	00:16:07	00:16:09	Yeah, do you mind not sitting on that, please?
282	00:16:12	00:16:13	Sorry.
283	00:16:13	00:16:16	You got any issues with the couch?
284	00:16:16	00:16:18	No, no, knock yourself out.
285	00:16:18	00:16:25	Does anybody else think it's odd that, um, the killer didn't actually kill the first girl?
286	00:16:25	00:16:26	Maybe he was interrupted.
287	00:16:26	00:16:28	The alley crime scene was not staged.
288	00:16:28	00:16:29	I don't think so.
289	00:16:29	00:16:31	I think the guy's methodical.
290	00:16:31	00:16:33	I think he wanted us to find her the way we did.
291	00:16:33	00:16:37	I actually agree with you on that, based on my research of the Gig Harbor Killer.
292	00:16:37	00:16:40	You've got to admit there's all these similarities.
293	00:16:40	00:16:46	The, uh, well, quasi-religious themes and the presenting of one gruesome tableaux after another.
294	00:16:46	00:16:47	This is not Gig Harbor.
295	00:16:47	00:16:49	Yeah, I know that.
296	00:16:49	00:16:54	But, you know, just-just like that case, we do need to start at the beginning.
297	00:16:54	00:16:59	Yeah, Angela came to us, concerned about girls missing from the stripper church.
298	00:16:59	00:17:04	Right, so if we want to retrace their steps, that's where we need to go.
299	00:17:04	00:17:07	I'm not here to preach damnation and hellfire.
300	00:17:07	00:17:09	I'm not gonna preach at all.
301	00:17:09	00:17:14	I'm just a messenger sent here to share my story.
302	00:17:14	00:17:17	The story...
303	00:17:17	00:17:31	of a man who used women for his own gratification, for the urges of others in the almighty pursuit of money, power, a sweet set of wheels.
304	00:17:33	00:17:36	How's it working out for you?
305	00:17:36	00:17:38	Shh.
306	00:17:38	00:17:40	Not so good.
307	00:17:40	00:17:46	That voice, you can call it God, you can call it conscience.
308	00:17:46	00:17:49	It's what made me see a different path.
309	00:17:49	00:17:51	Proverbs.
310	00:17:51	00:17:54	Let not mercy and truth forsake thee.
311	00:17:54	00:17:55	Bind them about thy neck.
312	00:17:55	00:17:58	Write them upon the table of thine heart.
313	00:17:58	00:17:59	Ooh.
314	00:17:59	00:18:03	Lord Almighty, God...
315	00:18:03	00:18:08	writes his name upon your heart because...
316	00:18:08	00:18:12	when your heart breaks, his word falls in.
317	00:18:12	00:18:14	Pray with me, brothers and sisters.
318	00:18:14	00:18:16	Excuse me. Pray with me.
319	00:18:16	00:18:17	Can I help you? Yeah, we're with the police.
320	00:18:17	00:18:21	Look, I don't mean to be rude, but, uh, a lot of us in here have had run-ins with the cops.
321	00:18:21	00:18:23	We don't want to scare anybody away, so...
322	00:18:23	00:18:24	if I can help you find who you're looking for...
323	00:18:24	00:18:26	It's okay, Jake. I can handle this.
324	00:18:28	00:18:30	Hi, Kitty. It's Angela now.
325	00:18:30	00:18:36	We'd just like to ask you and Brother Larson some more questions about the girls.
326	00:18:36	00:18:41	There's not a lot more I can share with you guys beside the information Angela's already given you.
327	00:18:41	00:18:44	Well, you certainly have a lot of followers.
328	00:18:44	00:18:46	How do you suppose they found their way here?
329	00:18:46	00:18:52	I don't have followers, and the people, they found their way here the same way I did; they hear the call.
330	00:18:52	00:19:01	Brother Larson takes his ministry to the streets, to prisons, to shelters, and those he saves become congregants, and many of them are volunteers like me.
331	00:19:01	00:19:06	You happen to have a list of names of the congregants?
332	00:19:06	00:19:07	There are no names here.
333	00:19:07	00:19:12	Uh, like that sign says, only fellowship.
334	00:19:12	00:19:17	(chuckles) Well, with all due respect, your fellowship is taking quite a hit.
335	00:19:17	00:19:21	I mean, with two dead women, another one barely hanging on.
336	00:19:21	00:19:24	This place is a sanctuary.
337	00:19:24	00:19:27	It's outside these walls where the souls are hunted.
338	00:19:29	00:19:32	Is this your Great Awakenings Bible, Brother?
339	00:19:32	00:19:33	Yes, it is.
340	00:19:35	00:19:40	So do you always make it a habit to carve your books out like that?
341	00:19:40	00:19:42	When the spirit moves me.
342	00:19:42	00:19:44	You mind if I borrow it?
343	00:19:45	00:19:47	May it bring you comfort, brother.
344	00:19:48	00:19:51	You know, I find it curious.
345	00:19:51	00:20:05	Women go missing every single day, and the police don't lift a finger, and yet when one of their own daughters, like Ellie Brass, is lost, they will part the seas and tumble down the walls to find her.
346	00:20:07	00:20:11	You question my mission, I question yours.
347	00:20:13	00:20:20	You know, in the 16 years that we were married, I never saw the inside of your office at the Newark PD.
348	00:20:20	00:20:24	Nancy, you know, you didn't really have to fly all the way out here.
349	00:20:24	00:20:28	You remember what happened the last time you tried to find her in Los Angeles by yourself?
350	00:20:28	00:20:33	You know, I don't have the will to listen to a whole recitation of my past failures, okay?
351	00:20:33	00:20:37	I-I can't beat myself up anymore about this.
352	00:20:38	00:20:39	Okay.
353	00:20:39	00:20:46	I didn't tell you this on the phone, but Ellie had your engagement ring, and then she sold it to another girl.
354	00:20:51	00:20:55	I guess, uh, she needed the money.
355	00:20:55	00:20:57	So you saw her, then.
356	00:20:57	00:21:01	Yeah, about a year ago, she stopped by my place in Jersey City with this guy.
357	00:21:01	00:21:03	He seemed nice.
358	00:21:03	00:21:10	Really? Did he know about her problems or drug use, prostitution? She said she was gonna tell him.
359	00:21:13	00:21:15	Well, you say Ellie's here.
360	00:21:15	00:21:17	I'm here, Vegas.
361	00:21:17	00:21:19	What's going on?
362	00:21:19	00:21:21	What's going on? I-I'm looking for her.
363	00:21:21	00:21:23	Don't you think I know when you're lying?
364	00:21:26	00:21:32	You were a lousy husband, but you're a great cop.
365	00:21:32	00:21:34	Find her.
366	00:21:34	00:21:40	I must say, running diagnostics on a computer seems incongruous for a man of action.
367	00:21:42	00:21:44	You just gonna stand there watching me like that?
368	00:21:47	00:21:49	I was thinking. Oh.
369	00:21:49	00:21:53	Hey, I got DNA and prints off of Larson's Bible, and I got a hit in the system.
370	00:21:53	00:21:58	Before he was Brother Larson, Daniel Larson was a street hustler working the Alphabets.
371	00:21:58	00:22:00	Priors for pandering, pimping.
372	00:22:00	00:22:03	At the time of his last arrest, he was found in possession of a firearm.
373	00:22:03	00:22:05	A .38.
374	00:22:05	00:22:07	It's the same caliber as the bullet we pulled out of the pimp in the freezer.
375	00:22:07	00:22:10	Maybe that's his weapon of choice.
376	00:22:10	00:22:11	It sounds like you've got your man, doesn't it?
377	00:22:11	00:22:14	That might work for your editor, but it doesn't work in a court of law.
378	00:22:14	00:22:15	We need a weapon.
379	00:22:15	00:22:20	Yeah, and besides, all of the Bibles and dowels at both crime scenes were wiped clean.
380	00:22:22	00:22:23	Well, this is interesting.
381	00:22:23	00:22:29	It looks like the Webcam broadcast of the food fetish show was turned on remotely.
382	00:22:29	00:22:30	How?
383	00:22:30	00:22:33	By a computer at the Fellowship of the Fallen Angels.
384	00:22:41	00:22:43	Whoa, whoa, whoa, where you going?
385	00:22:43	00:22:44	I'm going with you, aren't I?
386	00:22:44	00:22:46	When the smoke clears, I'll call you.
387	00:22:46	00:22:47	Till then, just sit tight.
388	00:22:49	00:22:52	Well, let's hope our man of God surrenders peacefully.
389	00:22:52	00:22:56	I'll be waiting by my phone.
390	00:23:02	00:23:03	Daniel Larson!
391	00:23:03	00:23:06	LVPD!
392	00:23:37	00:23:38	I need you to pray with me now.
393	00:23:38	00:23:42	Pray on change. Pray on hope.
394	00:23:42	00:23:45	Pray on a life free from the bondage of sin.
395	00:23:45	00:23:48	Because... oh, yes...
396	00:23:48	00:23:50	the forces of darkness will tempt you.
397	00:23:50	00:23:53	They will beckon to you.
398	00:23:53	00:23:55	They will beckon to you on every corner.
399	00:24:03	00:24:05	Stay still! You need to stay still! Angela?
400	00:24:05	00:24:07	Get off of her! You don't understand.
401	00:24:07	00:24:08	Get off. Angela! Let go of me!
402	00:24:08	00:24:10	Right there. Don't move. All right, don't worry.
403	00:24:10	00:24:11	Do not move. We're here for you.
404	00:24:36	00:24:39	What kind of game are you and Larson playing, Angela?
405	00:24:39	00:24:42	You come to us with names and faces of missing girls, one of them my daughter.
406	00:24:42	00:24:46	Right? And Larson's taunting us with messages from the crime scene. You're wrong.
407	00:24:46	00:24:49	Brother Larson and I had nothing to do with this. We were trying to help.
408	00:24:49	00:24:51	Mr. Russell, you know me.
409	00:24:51	00:24:52	What about the young woman we found you with?
410	00:24:52	00:24:54	The one strapped to the bed.
411	00:24:54	00:24:55	She's an addict.
412	00:24:55	00:24:57	Detoxing. She can't go to the hospital.
413	00:24:57	00:24:59	Where's Larson keeping the rest of the missing girls?
414	00:24:59	00:25:01	Where's my daughter? I don't know.
415	00:25:01	00:25:05	You're lying! You know what? You're the reason Ellie was on the street.
416	00:25:05	00:25:08	So don't accuse me of something you got only yourself to blame for.
417	00:25:10	00:25:12	I'm out of here.
418	00:25:15	00:25:17	Please say you believe me.
419	00:25:17	00:25:18	Where's Brother Larson right now?
420	00:25:18	00:25:20	I don't know.
421	00:25:20	00:25:25	She says she doesn't know where Larson is, but I've got a pretty good idea of where he was.
422	00:25:25	00:25:27	And I've got a concussion to prove it.
423	00:25:27	00:25:29	You think she's telling the truth?
424	00:25:29	00:25:31	That woman saved my life once.
425	00:25:31	00:25:36	She may have unwittingly recruited converts for Larson, yes, but...
426	00:25:36	00:25:38	I do believe that...
427	00:25:38	00:25:41	she was genuinely trying to help those women.
428	00:25:41	00:25:42	What about Brother Larson?
429	00:25:42	00:25:43	That's another story.
430	00:25:43	00:25:45	One I haven't figured out yet.
431	00:25:45	00:25:49	Well, I have been giving some thought to the, uh...
432	00:25:49	00:25:52	to the way in which the scenes were staged.
433	00:25:52	00:25:54	Stage-managed, if you like.
434	00:25:54	00:25:55	Take a look at that bed.
435	00:25:55	00:25:57	And the table and the lamps.
436	00:25:57	00:26:04	And then, if you look at the dessert scene, you can see the plates and the cakes, all ring shaped.
437	00:26:04	00:26:06	Even in the alley way, which didn't appear staged.
438	00:26:06	00:26:12	But if you look again, you've got a bicycle, a discarded mirror and a shattered clock.
439	00:26:16	00:26:17	Just like the wooden dowel.
440	00:26:17	00:26:19	We thought they were numbers.
441	00:26:19	00:26:20	Zeros.
442	00:26:20	00:26:23	He's playing games with you.
443	00:26:23	00:26:29	Well, your killer's a man of many signatures, but the one thing that seems to be constant-- these rings.
444	00:26:30	00:26:33	No, they're not rings.
445	00:26:33	00:26:35	They're circles.
446	00:27:45	00:27:48	We've been trying to figure out why this guy had multiple signatures.
447	00:27:48	00:27:51	Actually, I think that he got all of his inspiration from one place.
448	00:27:51	00:27:53	Dante's Inferno.
449	00:27:53	00:27:55	The Nine Circles of Hell.
450	00:27:55	00:27:56	First Circle, Limbo.
451	00:27:56	00:27:59	We were wondering why Teresa Hill survived.
452	00:27:59	00:28:01	It's because he wanted her to.
453	00:28:01	00:28:02	She's in a coma. She's in limbo.
454	00:28:02	00:28:03	Megan Ramirez.
455	00:28:03	00:28:07	Porn Star on a porn stage-- lust.
456	00:28:07	00:28:10	Chloe Rudolph, at the dessert table-- gluttony.
457	00:28:10	00:28:13	And her boyfriend who turned her out-- greed.
458	00:28:13	00:28:19	All staged to look exactly like engravings from a 16th century volume of the Divine Comedy.
459	00:28:19	00:28:22	You said he was giving us a show.
460	00:28:22	00:28:25	I'd say this looks more like a sermon.
461	00:28:25	00:28:26	Yeah, I agree.
462	00:28:26	00:28:27	And he's not done.
463	00:28:27	00:28:29	There are other missing women.
464	00:28:29	00:28:31	This guy's gonna drop bodies until we stop him.
465	00:28:31	00:28:35	Anger, heresy, violence, fraud, treachery.
466	00:28:35	00:28:38	Yeah, I've seen this movie before.
467	00:28:38	00:28:40	So has Brother Larson.
468	00:28:40	00:28:41	Anger is obviously next.
469	00:28:41	00:28:43	But how does this really help us?
470	00:28:43	00:28:45	It gets us into his head.
471	00:28:45	00:28:47	Beyond that, I don't really know.
472	00:28:47	00:28:53	Well, to quote a famous man from Seattle, identifying the killer's signature is the first step in making the hunter become the hunted.
473	00:28:53	00:28:55	This is why I don't do interviews anymore.
474	00:28:55	00:29:00	Well, considering we have so little evidence on this guy, (phone beeps) I'll give you a quote from me.
475	00:29:00	00:29:03	Sometimes we have to wait for a killer to make a mistake.
476	00:29:05	00:29:07	I think he just did.
477	00:29:11	00:29:14	Brother Larson. I'm CSI Russell.
478	00:29:14	00:29:15	And I'm confused.
479	00:29:15	00:29:18	I understand I'm being charged with a homicide.
480	00:29:18	00:29:21	Three, actually.
481	00:29:21	00:29:23	One attempted.
482	00:29:23	00:29:30	Teresa Hill, Megan Ramirez, Chloe Rudolph and her boyfriend, Greg Lee.
483	00:29:30	00:29:37	Ballistics on the gun found in your car when we picked you up matched the bullet taken from Greg Lee's head.
484	00:29:37	00:29:46	You also used the computer in your church to activate Chloe Rudolph's Webcam so that we would find her when you wanted us to.
485	00:29:46	00:29:51	It would seem I have enemies who seek to undo my good work.
486	00:29:51	00:29:54	Let's talk about that work. Mm-hmm.
487	00:29:54	00:29:57	We went through your cell phone, and we found photos of women.
488	00:29:57	00:30:00	Including all of the dead girls.
489	00:30:01	00:30:05	A shepherd watches over his flock.
490	00:30:05	00:30:12	I think that this shepherd chooses them very carefully for who they are, what they are.
491	00:30:12	00:30:14	Limbo. Lust. Gluttony.
492	00:30:14	00:30:20	I think you obsess over them, and then I think you punish them for their sins.
493	00:30:20	00:30:23	It's come to Jesus time, Brother.
494	00:30:23	00:30:27	You tell me where the rest of the girls are.
495	00:30:27	00:30:29	Where is Ellie Brass?
496	00:30:29	00:30:33	I am a sinner.
497	00:30:33	00:30:35	I am not a kidnapper.
498	00:30:35	00:30:39	And I am not... a murderer.
499	00:30:39	00:30:41	And I'm not a believer.
500	00:30:41	00:30:42	These are not my crimes.
501	00:30:42	00:30:48	Look, man, these girls going missing, I got nothing to do with that.
502	00:30:48	00:30:54	My only crime-- my only crime-- is making a little money.
503	00:30:54	00:30:56	Selling a little tail.
504	00:30:56	00:30:58	Go on.
505	00:30:58	00:30:59	I take these girls off the street, pal.
506	00:30:59	00:31:02	I give them a better life.
507	00:31:02	00:31:05	I introduce them to a better class of john.
508	00:31:05	00:31:06	So, you're still a pimp, is what you're saying?
509	00:31:06	00:31:08	And the pictures I sent online...
510	00:31:08	00:31:11	a client who reached out to my ministry.
511	00:31:11	00:31:12	Does that client have a name?
512	00:31:15	00:31:17	Anonymous.
513	00:31:17	00:31:19	Arrangements are always the same.
514	00:31:19	00:31:21	I send him pictures and bios, he picks a girl.
515	00:31:21	00:31:23	I drop her off at a corner.
516	00:31:23	00:31:24	A car comes.
517	00:31:24	00:31:29	Up until now, my little lambs have always found their way home.
518	00:31:29	00:31:31	Why should I believe any of this?
519	00:31:31	00:31:32	I confessed my sins already, pal.
520	00:31:32	00:31:34	I will not bear the sins of others.
521	00:31:34	00:31:36	And you prosecute me wrongly...
522	00:31:36	00:31:40	another body will drop, and that'll be your cross to bear.
523	00:31:40	00:31:44	Besides, if you catch this guy, you're gonna need me.
524	00:31:44	00:31:47	And I need an assurance of freedom.
525	00:31:47	00:31:48	Are you kidding me?
526	00:31:48	00:31:50	You don't have anything to bargain.
527	00:31:50	00:31:53	Ellie Brass?
528	00:31:53	00:31:54	She isn't missing.
529	00:31:55	00:31:57	I spoke to her this morning.
530	00:31:57	00:31:58	I know where she is.
531	00:31:59	00:32:02	Yeah. (chuckles)
532	00:32:02	00:32:05	I call my lawyer. We make a deal.
533	00:32:05	00:32:08	I then give you a miracle.
534	00:32:08	00:32:10	Prodigal daughter returned home.
535	00:32:13	00:32:17	Think Brother Larson's playing us for fools?
536	00:32:17	00:32:19	Greg processed his home computer.
537	00:32:19	00:32:22	Found online messages from Anonymous, just like he said.
538	00:32:22	00:32:25	Guy even put in a request for another girl for tonight.
539	00:32:25	00:32:28	Yeah, but that could just be a smoke screen, couldn't it?
540	00:32:28	00:32:29	And elaborate alibi.
541	00:32:29	00:32:31	Yeah, it could be.
542	00:32:31	00:32:33	Greg run trace on the computer?
543	00:32:33	00:32:35	All the messages came through a file-sharing site.
544	00:32:35	00:32:40	We could try for a warrant, but there's no law against posting pictures.
545	00:32:40	00:32:41	It's another dead end.
546	00:32:41	00:32:46	So, if Larson is just a pimp and Anonymous is the guy doing all this, how are we ever gonna get to him?
547	00:32:46	00:32:48	Morgan has a plan.
548	00:32:48	00:32:50	One that I think the DA will be very interested in.
549	00:32:50	00:32:52	Let's hear it.
550	00:32:52	00:32:56	Anonymous is requesting another girl for tonight, to add to his collection.
551	00:32:56	00:32:58	So let's give him one.
552	00:32:58	00:33:00	Use Larson to do it.
553	00:33:00	00:33:04	We know the guy posts pictures, the women get dropped off on the corner and taken up to his flat.
554	00:33:04	00:33:06	Obviously, you have someone in mind.
555	00:33:06	00:33:08	Yeah. I worked undercover in L.A., Dad.
556	00:33:08	00:33:10	I know what I'm doing.
557	00:33:10	00:33:13	You never dealt with anything like this in L.A., Morgan.
558	00:33:13	00:33:15	Right now, I'm not your daughter; I'm LVPD.
559	00:33:15	00:33:16	And now you're the sheriff.
560	00:33:16	00:33:18	You're gonna have to make tough decisions.
561	00:33:18	00:33:19	I really don't need you to tell me...
562	00:33:19	00:33:21	All right, whoa, whoa, hey, hey. Come on. Come on.
563	00:33:21	00:33:23	Take a deep breath here.
564	00:33:23	00:33:27	Obviously, Morgan is taking a huge risk by doing something like this.
565	00:33:27	00:33:32	But without an undercover operation, we are all just sitting around waiting for another body to drop.
566	00:33:32	00:33:34	You got into the killer's mind.
567	00:33:34	00:33:36	Maybe I can get into his home.
568	00:33:36	00:33:38	Get him to reveal himself.
569	00:33:38	00:33:41	Now, look, the crime scene suggests this man's a narcissist.
570	00:33:41	00:33:42	He's a showoff. He can't help himself.
571	00:33:42	00:33:47	He likes to brag, so maybe he's going to brag to this young lady.
572	00:33:47	00:33:49	Morgan's plan is a good one.
573	00:33:49	00:33:54	And there are other daughters who are out there right now in danger and fathers who are worried about them.
574	00:33:54	00:33:56	We know one of them.
575	00:33:59	00:34:01	I need to do this, Dad.
576	00:34:16	00:34:17	How do I look?
577	00:34:17	00:34:18	Looking good.
578	00:34:18	00:34:20	Unit one, you're in position?
579	00:34:20	00:34:21	Roger that.
580	00:34:21	00:34:23	Unit two. Nick? Greg?
581	00:34:23	00:34:25	Yeah, we got eyes on her.
582	00:34:37	00:34:39	Looks like it's on.
583	00:34:44	00:34:45	We're on the move.
584	00:34:45	00:34:47	Copy.
585	00:35:25	00:35:27	Well, well.
586	00:35:27	00:35:30	Pretty as a picture.
587	00:35:30	00:35:31	Please.
588	00:35:31	00:35:33	Come in.
589	00:35:44	00:35:46	Are you an art lover?
590	00:35:46	00:35:48	Not really.
591	00:35:48	00:35:50	You an art collector?
592	00:35:50	00:35:51	No.
593	00:35:51	00:35:55	I just like beautiful things.
594	00:35:55	00:36:03	Even when they're about something hideous, like suffering...
595	00:36:03	00:36:05	damnation...
596	00:36:05	00:36:06	hell.
597	00:36:06	00:36:08	Think we got our guy.
598	00:36:08	00:36:09	Got an I.D. on him yet?
599	00:36:09	00:36:10	Yeah, I'm running his address right now.
600	00:36:10	00:36:12	Oliver Tate.
601	00:36:12	00:36:14	Doesn't have a criminal record.
602	00:36:14	00:36:15	M.D., Ph.D.
603	00:36:15	00:36:18	Works for a biotech company.
604	00:36:18	00:36:23	And, truth be told, I am man of science.
605	00:36:23	00:36:27	Guess that explains all this stuff.
606	00:36:27	00:36:29	This stuff...
607	00:36:29	00:36:33	are the tools that man has used to seek knowledge.
608	00:36:33	00:36:40	To look deeper into the mysteries of the world, to educate the beast.
609	00:36:40	00:36:41	This is really cool.
610	00:36:41	00:36:42	What is it?
611	00:36:42	00:36:44	My prized possession.
612	00:36:44	00:36:46	It's kind of an abacus from the 16th century.
613	00:36:46	00:36:49	They're called Balliol's Bones.
614	00:36:49	00:36:50	I don't like this.
615	00:36:50	00:36:52	She's in control. She's gaining his trust.
616	00:36:54	00:36:57	Be right back.
617	00:37:01	00:37:02	When did this arrive?
618	00:37:02	00:37:05	Around, uh, midnight. I couldn't sleep.
619	00:37:05	00:37:10	I went down to the bar for a drink, and when I came back, it was outside my door.
620	00:37:10	00:37:12	Okay.
621	00:37:15	00:37:16	Is that blood?
622	00:37:16	00:37:17	What the hell is that inside?
623	00:37:17	00:37:19	Looks like a flash drive.
624	00:37:19	00:37:20	This...
625	00:37:20	00:37:22	is for you.
626	00:37:35	00:37:37	Anger.
627	00:37:37	00:37:39	Well, you are the angry girl.
628	00:37:41	00:37:43	At least that's what Larson promised me.
629	00:37:43	00:37:46	You care to tell me why?
630	00:37:46	00:37:48	You first.
631	00:37:48	00:37:54	Tell me why a good-looking, rich guy like you has to pay for company.
632	00:37:54	00:37:57	Pleasure, of course.
633	00:37:57	00:37:59	Pain, too?
634	00:38:01	00:38:06	It's my experience that women like you who want to be bad...
635	00:38:06	00:38:09	who want to be punished...
636	00:38:12	00:38:14	daddy issues.
637	00:38:15	00:38:17	You know me too well.
638	00:38:17	00:38:21	Brother Larson told me you have certain...
639	00:38:21	00:38:22	tastes.
640	00:38:22	00:38:24	Oh, don't worry, I don't bite.
641	00:38:24	00:38:26	Wouldn't matter if you did.
642	00:38:26	00:38:28	You're the one in control here.
643	00:38:28	00:38:31	You can do anything you want to me.
644	00:38:37	00:38:40	You want to hear a dirty little secret?
645	00:38:44	00:38:50	It turns me on when men talk about their conquests.
646	00:38:50	00:38:52	Their...
647	00:38:52	00:38:54	previous adventures.
648	00:38:57	00:39:00	Don't you want to turn me on?
649	00:39:03	00:39:06	I know I am not the first girl to ever receive a present from you.
650	00:39:06	00:39:09	So, come on.
651	00:39:09	00:39:11	We've got all night.
652	00:39:11	00:39:13	I'm not going anywhere.
653	00:39:13	00:39:15	Take off your clothes.
654	00:39:17	00:39:21	I like to see what I'm paying for.
655	00:39:35	00:39:36	I shouldn't be here.
656	00:39:36	00:39:38	Unit one, what's your 20?
657	00:39:38	00:39:40	We're in the lobby. I want you up on that floor-- I want you close.
658	00:39:40	00:39:42	I'm coming there now.
659	00:39:42	00:39:43	Anything happens, you radio me.
660	00:39:43	00:39:45	I will.
661	00:39:51	00:39:54	Lovely.
662	00:39:54	00:39:58	I just hate unnecessary adornment.
663	00:39:58	00:39:59	Oh, sorry.
664	00:39:59	00:40:01	Did I hurt you?
665	00:40:01	00:40:03	No.
666	00:40:08	00:40:10	Suddenly, I'm not in the mood.
667	00:40:13	00:40:16	Did I do something wrong?
668	00:40:19	00:40:21	Maybe another night.
669	00:40:23	00:40:25	But you said you liked what you saw.
670	00:40:27	00:40:29	Oh, I do.
671	00:40:29	00:40:33	My driver will take you back.
672	00:40:44	00:40:46	Fraud.
673	00:40:46	00:40:47	Eighth Circle of Hell.
674	00:40:47	00:40:50	You think he made her?
675	00:40:50	00:40:51	I don't know.
676	00:40:51	00:40:53	We should pick her up.
677	00:40:53	00:40:55	That's not the plan, Greg.
678	00:40:56	00:40:58	I don't know, something's not right.
679	00:40:58	00:41:05	Well, if he didn't make her, we might still have a chance to get this guy.
680	00:41:08	00:41:10	Vehicle's on the move.
681	00:41:10	00:41:11	So are we.
682	00:41:22	00:41:23	Tell them. Ellie!
683	00:41:23	00:41:24	Daddy, help me.
684	00:41:24	00:41:26	Tell them!
685	00:41:26	00:41:28	I have sinned. (slap, Ellie screams)
686	00:41:28	00:41:31	We have sinned, and we'll be punished.
687	00:41:32	00:41:36	We have sinned?
688	00:41:36	00:41:38	Oh, hell. All right.
689	00:41:38	00:41:39	What's happening?
690	00:41:39	00:41:41	Can't talk now. Where's Morgan?
691	00:41:41	00:41:43	He threw her out. No, he didn't.
692	00:41:43	00:41:44	Greg.
693	00:41:44	00:41:45	Stop the SUV.
694	00:41:45	00:41:47	Just reestablished visual.

700	00:42:02	00:42:03	Put them on the hood.
701	00:42:04	00:42:06	I said on the hood!
702	00:42:06	00:42:08	I know you.
703	00:42:08	00:42:10	You're that kid from the stripper church.
704	00:42:10	00:42:12	Nick! She's not here.
705	00:42:12	00:42:14	I told you we should've picked her up.
706	00:42:14	00:42:16	Where is she? Where's who?
707	00:42:16	00:42:17	The girl! Where's the girl?
708	00:42:17	00:42:19	I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
709	00:42:19	00:42:20	Boy, you out of your mind?
710	00:42:20	00:42:21	Huh?
711	00:42:21	00:42:22	Russell.

717	00:42:32	00:42:33	The killer's got Morgan.
718	00:42:33	00:42:35	And Ellie.
