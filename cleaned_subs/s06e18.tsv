0	00:00:17	00:00:24	Stacy Vollmer was last seen practicing alone on the school tennis court 00 p.m.
1	00:00:26	00:00:30	The clothes she was wearing were found in her locker.
2	00:00:39	00:00:46	Her body was discovered near the football field by the landscaping crew the following Monday morning.
3	00:00:49	00:00:51	Can you tell us the exact location of the body?
4	00:00:51	00:00:54	She was dumped in a flower bed, wrapped in a shower curtain.
5	00:00:57	00:01:01	CSI arrived an hour later, excavated the body and began processing the scene.
6	00:01:06	00:01:08	Dr. Robbins, can you tell us how Stacy died?
7	00:01:08	00:01:14	Beneath this laceration, I found a complex fracture of the occipital bone.
8	00:01:14	00:01:21	Multiple shards of bone were driven into the occipital lobe of the brain, resulting in massive bleeding.
9	00:01:21	00:01:27	The cause of death was cerebral hemorrhage, consistent with a single, sharp blow to her head.
10	00:01:34	00:01:41	A search of the defendant's home yielded a laundry hamper containing the clothes he wore the night of the murder.
11	00:01:41	00:01:44	Did you find any blood or DNA on the clothes?
12	00:01:44	00:01:46	No. We determined they had been bleached.
13	00:01:46	00:01:51	Isn't bleach used to destroy blood and DNA evidence?
14	00:01:51	00:01:55	argumentative. SINCLAIR What else did you find in the house?
15	00:01:55	00:02:01	Human hairs consistent with the victim were discovered in the drain of the bathroom sink.
16	00:02:01	00:02:04	DNA was extracted and was also matched to the victim.
17	00:02:05	00:02:08	And based on this evidence, police arrested Marlon West.
18	00:02:09	00:02:11	That's correct.
19	00:02:11	00:02:12	Thank you, Mr. Stokes.
20	00:02:13	00:02:15	No further questions.
21	00:02:16	00:02:19	The State now calls Hannah West.
22	00:02:19	00:02:21	Your Honor, defense reiterates our objection.
23	00:02:21	00:02:23	She's a 12-year-old girl.
24	00:02:23	00:02:26	We've been through this already, counsel.
25	00:02:26	00:02:28	The defendant's sister is being called as a hostile witness.
26	00:02:29	00:02:33	That means the district attorney is permitted to ask leading questions.
27	00:02:33	00:02:34	Be nice.
28	00:02:43	00:02:54	Now, Hannah, isn't it a fact that on the night of Friday, December 2, 2005, your parents left you and your brother, the defendant, home alone?
29	00:02:54	00:02:55	They went away for a...
30	00:02:55	00:02:56	Yes or no, please.
31	00:02:56	00:02:58	Yes.
32	00:02:58	00:03:06	And isn't it also a fact that you and your brother were not together 00 and 10 Well, Marlon-- he didn't really...
33	00:03:06	00:03:08	Yes or no?
34	00:03:08	00:03:09	Yes.
35	00:03:09	00:03:10	Thank you, Hannah.
36	00:03:10	00:03:13	I'd like to say something...
37	00:03:13	00:03:14	No further questions, Your Honor.
38	00:03:14	00:03:15	Cross-examination?
39	00:03:15	00:03:17	Absolutely, Your Honor.
40	00:03:17	00:03:21	Uh, Hannah, wh-what were you trying to say?
41	00:03:21	00:03:22	calls for a narrative.
42	00:03:22	00:03:23	Overruled.
43	00:03:23	00:03:25	You go ahead, Hannah.
44	00:03:25	00:03:26	You say what you need to say.
45	00:03:29	00:03:32	Marlon didn't kill Stacy.
46	00:03:36	00:03:38	I did.
47	00:03:41	00:03:43	And I was wearing this when I did it.
48	00:04:27	00:04:31	Good news is Judge Crawford denied the defense's motion to dismiss.
49	00:04:31	00:04:32	Of course he did.
50	00:04:33	00:04:35	She's just a mixed-up kid trying to protect her older brother.
51	00:04:35	00:04:37	All the evidence points to Marlon.
52	00:04:37	00:04:41	Yeah, and all the jury's going to remember is a little girl in a bloody shirt confessing to murder.
53	00:04:41	00:04:44	That's reasonable doubt on a silver platter.
54	00:04:44	00:04:46	All right, then we have to prove that Hannah could not have done this.
55	00:04:46	00:04:48	Exactly.
56	00:04:48	00:04:50	We'll need a week to reexamine the evidence.
57	00:04:50	00:04:52	Judge gave the D.A. a 72-hour continuance.
58	00:04:52	00:04:53	Come on... Best he could do, Nick.
59	00:04:53	00:04:56	Now you go do your best.
60	00:05:30	00:05:33	Everybody thought Stacy was so...
61	00:05:33	00:05:34	special.
62	00:05:34	00:05:36	She thought so, too.
63	00:05:36	00:05:38	She wasn't.
64	00:05:38	00:05:41	Stacy was a stuck-up bitch and a miserable person.
65	00:05:41	00:05:43	I just put her out of her misery.
66	00:05:46	00:05:48	I killed her and I put her in the ground.
67	00:05:48	00:05:50	That's all I've got to say.
68	00:05:52	00:05:58	The judge suppressed the video because a child advocate was never brought in, even though Marlon had waived his rights.
69	00:05:58	00:06:00	We really didn't need a confession out of him.
70	00:06:00	00:06:02	The case against this kid was solid.
71	00:06:05	00:06:08	a sabotaged showerhead.
72	00:06:10	00:06:18	PH tests later revealed the presence of a strong base substance which was later identified as sodium hydroxide.
73	00:06:18	00:06:21	Sounds like Marlon packed the showerhead with elemental sodium.
74	00:06:21	00:06:22	A high school chemistry favorite, yeah.
75	00:06:22	00:06:24	Just add water, and instant kaboom.
76	00:06:24	00:06:28	Those out-of-order signs must've been part of his game.
77	00:06:28	00:06:31	You funnel the victim to the right showerhead.
78	00:06:31	00:06:32	Did you process these?
79	00:06:32	00:06:37	Yeah, I matched the spindle marks on the paper to a laser printer in the high school library.
80	00:06:37	00:06:39	Accessible to any student.
81	00:06:39	00:06:40	Mm-hmm.
82	00:06:40	00:06:48	Multiple fragments of metal penetrating the skin and dermis as deep as the superficial musculature of the back and neck.
83	00:06:48	00:06:49	The showerhead explosion didn't kill her.
84	00:06:50	00:06:51	No, no, it did not.
85	00:06:51	00:06:53	What happened to the shower curtain?
86	00:06:54	00:06:56	Well, the vic was injured, disoriented.
87	00:06:56	00:06:59	She grabbed the first thing she could to cover up and ran.
88	00:07:01	00:07:05	The intermittent blood trail started in the locker room and headed down a hall.
89	00:07:07	00:07:09	So Marlon followed her out just to hear her squeal?
90	00:07:09	00:07:11	Or chased her out, yeah.
91	00:07:11	00:07:13	There's no way to know.
92	00:07:13	00:07:14	Either way, she ended up at the bottom of the stairs.
93	00:07:15	00:07:19	The size of the blood pool indicates that the fatal wound occurred there.
94	00:07:19	00:07:22	Do you have any physical evidence that would conclusively rule Hannah out as a suspect?
95	00:07:22	00:07:27	Well, yeah-- she's four-foot-three and 65 pounds.
96	00:07:27	00:07:30	The crime just required more strength than she's got.
97	00:07:30	00:07:32	How old is she?
98	00:07:32	00:07:33	Twelve.
99	00:07:34	00:07:35	In high school?
100	00:07:36	00:07:37	She's a high school senior.
101	00:07:37	00:07:39	She skipped six grades.
102	00:07:40	00:07:41	She's a prodigy.
103	00:07:41	00:07:44	Which means she has the brains for murder.
104	00:07:44	00:07:45	Yeah, but not the brawn.
105	00:07:45	00:07:50	The body was moved from the high school building across a football field and then hastily buried.
106	00:07:50	00:08:00	The vic's car was then driven two miles from campus and parked in front of the house of a kid named Scott Baird, Stacy's boyfriend-- I think possibly to frame him.
107	00:08:00	00:08:01	Was he ever a suspect?
108	00:08:02	00:08:03	No. He plays varsity hoops.
109	00:08:03	00:08:05	He was out of town on an away game.
110	00:08:05	00:08:13	I found blades of grass with blood on them near the vic's car-- nondescript tracks headed towards the next-door neighbor's house.
111	00:08:13	00:08:14	Marlon West.
112	00:08:14	00:08:16	Yeah. This kid's been in trouble before.
113	00:08:16	00:08:17	Multiple fights, threats.
114	00:08:17	00:08:20	It just got out of hand this time.
115	00:08:20	00:08:23	Marlon West killed Stacy Vollmer.
116	00:08:23	00:08:27	His little sister's just trying to exonerate him.
117	00:09:30	00:09:31	Hey, Nick.
118	00:09:31	00:09:34	Hodges, did you get the soil analysis back on Hannah's shirt?
119	00:09:34	00:09:36	Matches the site of the body dump. Really!
120	00:09:36	00:09:39	So does this make Doogie Howser-ette your killer?
121	00:09:39	00:09:40	Uh, I kind of doubt it.
122	00:09:40	00:09:43	Don't be so sure. It's not easy.
123	00:09:44	00:09:46	What isn't easy, Hodges?
124	00:09:46	00:09:51	Being profoundly gifted, knowing that everybody knows that you're always ten steps ahead of them.
125	00:09:52	00:09:53	It's a lot of pressure.
126	00:09:53	00:09:56	Some days, you feel like you're just going to snap.
127	00:09:56	00:09:57	I know the feeling.
128	00:09:57	00:10:03	In his confession, Marlon basically said that Stacy deserved to die.
129	00:10:03	00:10:05	He was alone in that opinion.
130	00:10:05	00:10:08	Everybody loved Stacy-- parents and students.
131	00:10:08	00:10:12	4.0 GPA, varsity tennis team, homecoming queen.
132	00:10:12	00:10:16	She even took a public virginity pledge with some of her classmates.
133	00:10:16	00:10:18	Did they have those in your high school?
134	00:10:18	00:10:20	No.
135	00:10:20	00:10:21	Do you believe that Marlon killed her?
136	00:10:21	00:10:25	I was looking right into his eyes when he told me he did it.
137	00:10:25	00:10:28	There's no doubt in my mind.
138	00:10:28	00:10:31	Two confessions, one crime.
139	00:10:31	00:10:33	We don't get that a lot.
140	00:10:33	00:10:35	When did you last speak with Marlon?
141	00:10:35	00:10:39	The day the police came to my house and arrested him.
142	00:10:39	00:10:40	You don't visit him?
143	00:10:40	00:10:42	My parents won't let me see him in jail.
144	00:10:42	00:10:44	Bad environment.
145	00:10:44	00:10:47	Marlon didn't put me up to this.
146	00:10:47	00:10:48	He was trying to protect me.
147	00:10:48	00:10:52	It would've been wrong to let him be punished for something I did.
148	00:10:55	00:10:58	You don't think I could have done it.
149	00:10:58	00:11:00	Neither one of you.
150	00:11:00	00:11:03	That's a big job for a little girl.
151	00:11:03	00:11:06	Not if you have the right tools.
152	00:11:06	00:11:10	Smart kid like you... knows your brother's suffering.
153	00:11:10	00:11:15	You feel bad, you want to help, so you fabricate some evidence.
154	00:11:15	00:11:19	If you thought that the evidence was fake, I wouldn't still be in jail.
155	00:11:22	00:11:25	Aren't you going to ask me why I did it?
156	00:11:25	00:11:27	Would you like to tell us?
157	00:11:29	00:11:30	I throw off the curve.
158	00:11:30	00:11:35	When I'm in a class, people who usually get A's, suddenly get C's.
159	00:11:35	00:11:37	Stacy was applying to Harvard.
160	00:11:37	00:11:40	She wanted me to dumb myself down.
161	00:11:40	00:11:41	I said no.
162	00:11:42	00:11:44	She didn't like that.
163	00:11:48	00:11:50	Uh... babies use the wall dryer.
164	00:11:58	00:12:01	So you killed her because she messed up your hair?
165	00:12:01	00:12:03	No.
166	00:12:03	00:12:05	I'm used to pranks like that.
167	00:12:05	00:12:08	I get them most every day.
168	00:12:08	00:12:10	But Stacy... didn't stop there.
169	00:12:10	00:12:13	She had to take it to another level.
170	00:12:13	00:12:16	And she used Scott to do it.
171	00:12:16	00:12:18	Scott Baird, Stacy's boyfriend.
172	00:12:18	00:12:22	I was his tutor.
173	00:12:22	00:12:25	You know, I was really pissed off at Stacy when I heard about the whole...
174	00:12:25	00:12:30	hair dryer thing, but her... her friends had put her up to it.
175	00:12:30	00:12:32	Stacy wanted me to give you something.
176	00:12:34	00:12:36	It's a peace offering.
177	00:12:36	00:12:38	I think you'll look great in it at the Spring Formal.
178	00:12:40	00:12:42	Oh, you are so going.
179	00:12:44	00:12:46	You like him.
180	00:12:46	00:12:49	He's on the basketball team.
181	00:12:49	00:12:53	I'm 12; I'm not allowed to like him, but...
182	00:12:53	00:12:55	I went anyway.
183	00:13:06	00:13:08	Over here.
184	00:13:31	00:13:33	The pictures were up on MySpace that night.
185	00:13:33	00:13:35	I got a ton of e-mails.
186	00:13:35	00:13:38	You put sodium in the showerhead to get back at her?
187	00:13:38	00:13:41	A prank for a prank.
188	00:13:41	00:13:49	I thought that there'd be a few sparks, that she'd freak out and that'd be it, but the nozzle exploded.
189	00:13:49	00:13:54	Stacy ran... and fell down the stairs...
190	00:13:54	00:13:56	and died.
191	00:13:57	00:14:00	I tried to cover it up.
192	00:14:00	00:14:02	You miscalculated.
193	00:14:02	00:14:05	I guess I did.
194	00:14:08	00:14:09	You rang?
195	00:14:09	00:14:12	Got the DNA results on the blood from Hannah's sweater.
196	00:14:12	00:14:14	Stacy.
197	00:14:14	00:14:15	Hannah.
198	00:14:15	00:14:20	So she fabricated evidence, and put her own blood on the shirt.
199	00:14:20	00:14:21	Maybe, maybe not.
200	00:14:22	00:14:24	The soil on the shirt was consistent with the dump site.
201	00:14:24	00:14:26	Hannah could've been at the scene.
202	00:14:28	00:14:30	She could have cut herself burying the body.
203	00:14:34	00:14:40	Or she could have gone back to the field at any time within the last four months and rubbed her shirt in the same kind of dirt.
204	00:14:40	00:14:42	And counted on us to make the match?
205	00:14:42	00:14:43	Well, that's just plain scary smart.
206	00:14:43	00:14:49	I mean, my daughter's a few years older than her, and the most important thing on her mind right now is how much belly button to show off at the mall.
207	00:14:51	00:14:53	Never thought I'd be grateful for that.
208	00:15:01	00:15:04	You have to understand.
209	00:15:04	00:15:06	My child's not capable of murder.
210	00:15:06	00:15:08	I assume you mean Hannah.
211	00:15:08	00:15:10	Of course.
212	00:15:13	00:15:15	Well, Marlon's your child, too.
213	00:15:15	00:15:17	Marlon's from my wife's first marriage.
214	00:15:17	00:15:18	He's more like his father.
215	00:15:30	00:15:32	This is Marlon's room.
216	00:15:32	00:15:34	No kidding.
217	00:15:34	00:15:36	It's pretty much the way I left it.
218	00:15:38	00:15:41	The bleached clothes were in the hamper.
219	00:15:42	00:15:44	But the real action...
220	00:15:44	00:15:46	was in here.
221	00:15:50	00:15:53	Shared bathroom. Very Brady.
222	00:15:54	00:15:57	Pulled Stacy's hairs out of the sink trap the first time through.
223	00:15:57	00:16:03	And I found some burn marks around the bathtub drain.
224	00:16:03	00:16:06	pH tested positive for sodium hydroxide, so...
225	00:16:06	00:16:10	I figured Marlon probably did a test run.
226	00:16:39	00:16:44	The scope of the warrant only covered Marlon's room and other common areas of the house.
227	00:16:44	00:16:45	I popped my head in here.
228	00:16:45	00:16:47	Nothing in plain sight at the time.
229	00:17:04	00:17:05	Was this here before?
230	00:17:05	00:17:07	It wasn't in plain sight.
231	00:17:07	00:17:08	I didn't check it.
232	00:17:08	00:17:12	Looks like Hannah won the science fair with a project about sodium.
233	00:17:16	00:17:18	Hannah's just trying to help Marlon.
234	00:17:18	00:17:19	So they're close?
235	00:17:19	00:17:21	No, not really.
236	00:17:21	00:17:24	Sometimes I think if they didn't share a bathroom, they wouldn't see each other at all.
237	00:17:24	00:17:26	What do you mean?
238	00:17:26	00:17:27	They're on different academic tracks.
239	00:17:27	00:17:32	Never take any of the same classes, and travel in completely different social circles.
240	00:17:32	00:17:36	From what we understand, Hannah doesn't really have a social circle.
241	00:17:36	00:17:40	The other students bore her.
242	00:17:40	00:17:42	Hannah spends most of her time with her teachers.
243	00:17:42	00:17:43	And Marlon?
244	00:17:44	00:17:47	I guess...
245	00:17:47	00:17:50	I guess he spends most of his time alone.
246	00:18:05	00:18:07	Rainbow party?!
247	00:18:07	00:18:13	Yeah, it's a party game where boys get the girls to wear different colored lipsticks while they have oral sex.
248	00:18:13	00:18:15	Boy with the most colors wins.
249	00:18:15	00:18:17	Supposed to be trendy.
250	00:18:17	00:18:18	So much for Spin the Bottle.
251	00:18:18	00:18:21	Carrie.
252	00:18:21	00:18:26	Weird high school girl gets humiliated at the prom, only to exact her revenge.
253	00:18:26	00:18:28	Hannah wanted us to find this.
254	00:18:28	00:18:29	Maybe.
255	00:18:29	00:18:33	Question is, did she read the book before...
256	00:18:33	00:18:35	or after the murder?
257	00:18:35	00:18:38	We had Hannah's I.Q. tested when she was eight.
258	00:18:38	00:18:40	It's 177.
259	00:18:40	00:18:43	She really is one in a million.
260	00:18:43	00:18:44	Hannah's special.
261	00:18:44	00:18:45	She's an indigo child.
262	00:18:45	00:18:47	Indigo child?
263	00:18:47	00:18:49	A new breed.
264	00:18:49	00:18:56	Hannah doesn't just see the world, she sees through it, through people, with an intuition none of us can comprehend.
265	00:18:56	00:19:02	She's compelled to help others, whether they're worth helping or not.
266	00:19:37	00:19:40	Ah, the shower curtain the vic was wrapped in.
267	00:19:40	00:19:44	Yeah, I had Mandy run the unknowns from the original case against Hannah's prints.
268	00:19:44	00:19:45	She got a match.
269	00:19:46	00:19:47	Okay.
270	00:19:47	00:19:50	But Hannah uses those showers after gym class.
271	00:19:50	00:19:53	This curtain was used in the handicapped shower.
272	00:19:53	00:19:54	Why would she do that?
273	00:19:54	00:19:56	Probably hiding her body.
274	00:19:56	00:19:57	She's 12.
275	00:19:57	00:20:00	She hasn't reached puberty.
276	00:20:00	00:20:02	Undeveloped teen girls are very self-conscious.
277	00:20:02	00:20:03	Mm-hmm.
278	00:20:04	00:20:07	Four... fingers, closely spaced.
279	00:20:07	00:20:09	Grabbing, maybe.
280	00:20:09	00:20:13	Could be from Hannah dragging Stacy's body.
281	00:20:19	00:20:21	Hannah weighed 65 pounds.
282	00:20:21	00:20:23	Stacy about a hundred.
283	00:20:23	00:20:24	Dead weight.
284	00:20:24	00:20:27	Plastic slides on grass.
285	00:20:27	00:20:30	It makes it easier. It's certainly possible.
286	00:20:30	00:20:33	D.A.'s not going to like the sound of that.
287	00:20:38	00:20:41	Sodium demonstration is always a real crowd pleaser. ( chuckles )
288	00:20:42	00:20:45	It's ended up in a senior prank more than once.
289	00:20:45	00:20:50	I keep it over here, under lock and key, but, unfortunately, the lab's always getting broken into.
290	00:20:54	00:20:56	It's certainly possible Marlon got the sodium from here.
291	00:20:56	00:20:58	Everyone have their goggles on?
292	00:21:07	00:21:10	Which is precisely what I told the cops four months ago.
293	00:21:10	00:21:11	You need gloves to handle elemental sodium.
294	00:21:11	00:21:13	Of course.
295	00:21:13	00:21:15	It burns skin.
296	00:21:15	00:21:17	We keep it in kerosene to stabilize it.
297	00:21:17	00:21:20	Do you think it's possible that Hannah could have stolen it?
298	00:21:20	00:21:22	Hannah would never do that.
299	00:21:22	00:21:26	I'm just wondering if it's possible.
300	00:21:26	00:21:30	She obviously has access to this room. Ms. Sidle...
301	00:21:30	00:21:35	I've had my share of good students over the years, but Hannah...
302	00:21:35	00:21:42	Sometimes, right in the middle of a lecture, I'll catch her staring at some little thing in the yard-- a tree, a squirrel...
303	00:21:42	00:21:47	and all I can think about is how much I wish I could see it the way she does.
304	00:21:47	00:21:55	If Hannah came up and asked me for a chunk of sodium, I'd give it to her, just to see what she would do with it.
305	00:21:55	00:21:58	The victim's car.
306	00:21:58	00:22:00	Originally impounded...
307	00:22:01	00:22:03	in front of Scott Baird's house.
308	00:22:03	00:22:08	Traces of blood and soil consistent with the crime were found in the front seat.
309	00:22:08	00:22:12	Now, if Hannah's the killer, she had to drive this car.
310	00:22:15	00:22:20	Well, it's got adjustable seats, tilt and telescoping steering wheel-- it's certainly possible.
311	00:22:24	00:22:26	Soil and blood on the carpet.
312	00:22:27	00:22:28	That was in the report.
313	00:22:40	00:22:41	But this wasn't.
314	00:23:12	00:23:14	I'd say the killer moved the seat.
315	00:23:14	00:23:16	Yeah.
316	00:23:26	00:23:27	12-year-old killer, huh?
317	00:23:27	00:23:30	Starting to look that way, yeah.
318	00:23:30	00:23:32	I bet that Grand Theft Auto had something to do with it.
319	00:23:32	00:23:34	Mm, I don't know.
320	00:23:34	00:23:35	I don't think Hannah's really the video-game type.
321	00:23:35	00:23:37	Never know.
322	00:23:37	00:23:40	Between you and me, I actually think it's a ton of fun.
323	00:23:47	00:23:50	Print is a match to a Scott Baird.
324	00:23:50	00:23:52	Isn't that the victim's boyfriend?
325	00:23:56	00:24:00	Two people confessed to the murder, and now you're accusing my son?
326	00:24:00	00:24:02	Kids do stupid things.
327	00:24:02	00:24:05	Marlon covers for Hannah, Hannah covers for Scott.
328	00:24:05	00:24:07	Dad... Don't say a word.
329	00:24:07	00:24:12	DNA confirmed your fingerprint in Stacy's car, in Stacy's blood.
330	00:24:12	00:24:13	Scott loved Stacy.
331	00:24:13	00:24:14	We all did.
332	00:24:14	00:24:21	And when whoever killed her parked her car in my driveway to frame my son, I understood why you had to talk to him.
333	00:24:21	00:24:22	But this?
334	00:24:24	00:24:26	That's it.
335	00:24:26	00:24:28	We're leaving. Come on, Scott.
336	00:24:28	00:24:29	This is the only chance you're going to get.
337	00:24:29	00:24:33	If you walk out that door, you're under arrest.
338	00:24:33	00:24:34	I want a lawyer.
339	00:24:34	00:24:35	I want to talk.
340	00:24:35	00:24:36	Scott.
341	00:24:37	00:24:38	Without my dad.
342	00:24:46	00:24:48	This is ridiculous.
343	00:24:48	00:24:52	I asked you guys to rule out one suspect, now we have three.
344	00:24:52	00:24:55	If he's willing to talk, I'd say we caught a break.
345	00:24:55	00:24:57	The father's going to sue.
346	00:24:57	00:24:59	Oh, I'd put money on that.
347	00:24:59	00:25:00	Okay, Scott.
348	00:25:00	00:25:01	You said you wanted to talk.
349	00:25:01	00:25:03	Let's talk.
350	00:25:03	00:25:07	This doesn't get back to our families, all right?
351	00:25:07	00:25:10	My dad's a deacon, and Stacy's dad is, too.
352	00:25:10	00:25:13	They'll never understand.
353	00:25:13	00:25:14	They won't hear anything from me.
354	00:25:17	00:25:21	I was pressuring Stacy to have sex.
355	00:25:21	00:25:23	She kept resisting.
356	00:25:23	00:25:28	It was that stupid virginity pledge that she had taken at the high school.
357	00:25:28	00:25:34	I told her that I loved her, and that nothing should get in the way of that.
358	00:25:36	00:25:37	Not even God.
359	00:25:38	00:25:40	I take it that convinced her.
360	00:25:43	00:25:44	Yeah.
361	00:25:47	00:25:49	I mean, really?
362	00:25:49	00:25:51	You really do?
363	00:25:51	00:25:52	Yeah.
364	00:25:52	00:25:54	I love you.
365	00:25:55	00:25:57	I love you with all of my heart.
366	00:26:01	00:26:03	There was a little blood.
367	00:26:03	00:26:06	Not a lot, but...
368	00:26:06	00:26:13	After, she... she started feeling guilty, so I went back into the front of the car and I tossed the condom.
369	00:26:13	00:26:17	And... then I...
370	00:26:17	00:26:19	wiped my fingers under the seat.
371	00:26:20	00:26:22	Hello? Hodges, Stokes.
372	00:26:22	00:26:26	Listen, there's a bloody fingerprint in the back freezer from Stacy Vollmer's car.
373	00:26:26	00:26:29	Pull it and test it for spermicides and lubricants.
374	00:26:29	00:26:31	We need it quickly, all right?
375	00:26:31	00:26:32	I'm on it.
376	00:26:32	00:26:35	If it tests positive, it will clear him.
377	00:26:35	00:26:36	Yeah.
378	00:26:36	00:26:39	Which means we're down to Malcolm and Hannah.
379	00:26:39	00:26:41	Right back where we started.
380	00:26:41	00:26:47	Stacy said that she was afraid that God would punish her for having sex.
381	00:26:47	00:26:50	I told her that was crazy.
382	00:26:51	00:26:54	Guess I was wrong.
383	00:26:54	00:26:58	Archie is not getting much off of Hannah's computer.
384	00:26:58	00:27:01	Most of her files are encrypted AES-256.
385	00:27:01	00:27:03	It's going to be nearly impossible to crack.
386	00:27:03	00:27:04	What do you mean by most?
387	00:27:04	00:27:09	Well, it's not much, but apparently Hannah had I.P. access to the laser printer in the high school library.
388	00:27:09	00:27:11	Same one that printed the Out of Order signs for the shower.
389	00:27:11	00:27:14	If she printed those signs, it shows intent.
390	00:27:14	00:27:15	Mm-hmm.
391	00:27:15	00:27:17	Ah, teen lust.
392	00:27:17	00:27:26	Starts with some chemistry, and then you mess around with some biology, and once you have some experience under your belt, then you introduce the physics.
393	00:27:29	00:27:31	the bloody fingerprint tested positive for nonoxynol spermicide.
394	00:27:31	00:27:33	So much for the boyfriend.
395	00:27:33	00:27:38	If we can't pin this on Hannah or Marlon, they could both walk.
396	00:27:38	00:27:40	You could flip a coin.
397	00:27:40	00:27:42	I have a better idea.
398	00:27:46	00:27:49	I bet you really liked high school.
399	00:27:49	00:27:53	Yeah, playing football, chasing girls, books when I wanted to learn something-- what's not to like?
400	00:27:53	00:27:54	Hey, guys. Hey.
401	00:27:54	00:27:56	Hi, Darcy.
402	00:27:56	00:27:58	You were right; she's about Hannah's size.
403	00:27:58	00:28:01	More or less. Stop talking about me.
404	00:28:01	00:28:02	Hey, that's the best part!
405	00:28:02	00:28:05	That's what the pause button's for.
406	00:28:05	00:28:07	It's time to work, it's child labor day.
407	00:28:08	00:28:09	Okay.
408	00:28:09	00:28:11	Crime started right here.
409	00:28:14	00:28:16	Think you could reach that?
410	00:28:21	00:28:24	It's kind of hard to sabotage a shower head you can't touch.
411	00:28:24	00:28:26	Depends on what's behind the curtain.
412	00:28:27	00:28:28	Look at that.
413	00:28:31	00:28:33	Just like the one in Hannah's bathroom.
414	00:28:33	00:28:35	Try this.
415	00:28:41	00:28:45	Hannah had access to the chem lab, and she knew how to handle sodium...
416	00:28:53	00:28:56	Stacy would not have known what hit her.
417	00:28:56	00:28:57	Or where she was going.
418	00:29:08	00:29:13	Stacy landed here and bled out from the trauma to her skull.
419	00:29:13	00:29:15	Darcy, why don't you put those headphones back on?
420	00:29:15	00:29:18	Like I didn't hear what you guys just said?
421	00:29:19	00:29:21	Hannah could have done this.
422	00:29:21	00:29:22	Maybe.
423	00:29:22	00:29:25	But the next part, that was the toughest.
424	00:29:27	00:29:28	It's too heavy!
425	00:29:28	00:29:30	Come on, you're almost there!
426	00:29:30	00:29:32	It's building character!
427	00:29:32	00:29:34	It's slow going, but you're doing it.
428	00:29:34	00:29:35	Yeah, so far.
429	00:29:35	00:29:36	That's okay.
430	00:29:36	00:29:41	Look, even if she makes it to the grass, you think she could've pulled the body the entire length of the football field?
431	00:29:41	00:29:45	There were scratches on the shower curtain-- the body was dragged at least part of the way.
432	00:29:45	00:29:48	There's no way Hannah pulled it the entire distance.
433	00:29:48	00:29:50	Not by herself.
434	00:29:52	00:29:53	They did it together.
435	00:29:53	00:29:55	So...
436	00:29:55	00:29:57	Did I help the dead girl?
437	00:30:02	00:30:06	If Marlon and Hannah committed this crime together, then they're probably still working as a team.
438	00:30:07	00:30:09	he confesses, then she confesses.
439	00:30:10	00:30:14	Muddy the waters enough, they both get off on reasonable doubt. Mm-hmm.
440	00:30:14	00:30:18	Well, if we can't get one to implicate the other, we're screwed.
441	00:30:20	00:30:21	I don't get it.
442	00:30:21	00:30:22	What's wrong with you people?
443	00:30:22	00:30:24	You want me to confess? Again?
444	00:30:24	00:30:26	Fine, I will.
445	00:30:26	00:30:32	Marlon, you need to confirm that you're willing to talk to me without a parent or lawyer present, just a child advocate.
446	00:30:32	00:30:34	I already said that was okay.
447	00:30:34	00:30:36	I killed Stacy, what else do I have to tell you?
448	00:30:36	00:30:40	Well, the truth works for me.
449	00:30:40	00:30:41	I like the truth.
450	00:30:41	00:30:44	Look, I don't need a lawyer, and I don't need my parents.
451	00:30:44	00:30:46	I just want to do what's right.
452	00:30:46	00:30:51	Hannah, taking the blame for something you didn't do may be noble, but it doesn't make it right.
453	00:30:51	00:30:53	That's deep.
454	00:30:54	00:30:55	Okay.
455	00:30:56	00:30:59	Stacy humiliated me, I wanted revenge.
456	00:30:59	00:31:02	Yeah, and you knew that there was no way you were ever going to get it by yourself.
457	00:31:02	00:31:06	You moved the body, you buried it...
458	00:31:06	00:31:08	I know I did; I was there.
459	00:31:08	00:31:09	What's the problem?
460	00:31:09	00:31:12	Well, the problem is what happened in the locker room.
461	00:31:12	00:31:16	I mean, you're not the kind of guy who puts sodium in a shower head to get back at somebody.
462	00:31:16	00:31:18	You just trip them in the hallway.
463	00:31:19	00:31:22	So you think I'm too stupid to have done it.
464	00:31:22	00:31:24	Great, join the club.
465	00:31:24	00:31:29	I don't think you're stupid, Marlon, I didn't say you were stupid.
466	00:31:29	00:31:31	But this is Hannah's game.
467	00:31:31	00:31:32	The whole way. Uh-uh.
468	00:31:32	00:31:34	I broke into the chem lab.
469	00:31:34	00:31:35	I stole the sodium.
470	00:31:35	00:31:36	Me.
471	00:31:36	00:31:37	All by myself.
472	00:31:37	00:31:40	It takes skills to handle a chemical like that properly.
473	00:31:40	00:31:44	And, quite frankly, man, you just don't have the skills.
474	00:31:44	00:31:47	Your prank went bad, and Stacy ended up dead. That's what I said.
475	00:31:47	00:31:49	Marlon helped you bury her.
476	00:31:49	00:31:50	No. Why won't you believe me?
477	00:31:50	00:31:51	Marlon wasn't there.
478	00:31:51	00:31:53	Stay away from Hannah.
479	00:31:53	00:31:55	She had nothing to do with this.
480	00:31:55	00:31:59	No, no, she had everything to do with this.
481	00:31:59	00:32:01	You two were working together from the beginning. Just leave her alone.
482	00:32:01	00:32:03	Marlon helped you move the body.
483	00:32:03	00:32:13	He didn't! You expect me to believe that a little girl like you lugged a hundred pounds of dead weight the length of a football field by yourself? No, of course not, that's why I had to use the cart.
484	00:32:14	00:32:15	What cart?
485	00:32:15	00:32:16	The electric cart.
486	00:32:16	00:32:18	The one the landscapers were using.
487	00:32:18	00:32:21	It was just sitting there, right outside the door.
488	00:32:34	00:32:36	Wait a minute.
489	00:32:36	00:32:38	I got something.
490	00:32:39	00:32:42	Let me clean up this image.
491	00:32:48	00:32:50	I see a cart, Sara.
492	00:32:55	00:32:57	So Hannah could be telling the truth.
493	00:32:57	00:32:59	It's enough for reasonable doubt.
494	00:32:59	00:33:03	Great. Thanks, Warrick.
495	00:33:03	00:33:05	Yeah.
496	00:33:12	00:33:16	The evidence says either one of them could have done it, but I think they were in it together.
497	00:33:17	00:33:22	Okay, I'll proceed against Marlon for the murder and bring charges against Hannah for conspiracy.
498	00:33:22	00:33:23	Another trial?
499	00:33:23	00:33:25	You sure you want to go through all this again?
500	00:33:25	00:33:29	Stacy's parents and the community will have my ass if I don't.
501	00:33:29	00:33:30	Well, then maybe this is good news.
502	00:33:30	00:33:34	I was just going over Sofia's notes from the original investigation.
503	00:33:34	00:33:38	The night of the murder, Hannah and Marlon's parents had left them alone in the house.
504	00:33:38	00:33:42	00 p.m.
505	00:33:42	00:33:44	That's right around Stacy's T.O.D.
506	00:33:44	00:33:46	So, did anybody talk to the delivery guy?
507	00:33:46	00:33:48	Yes, and at the point that Sofia did, a month had passed.
508	00:33:48	00:33:50	Now, the delivery guy's at the house all the time.
509	00:33:50	00:33:57	He recognized photos of both kids, but he could not be sure which one answered the door that night.
510	00:33:57	00:34:00	But one of them did answer the door.
511	00:34:01	00:34:04	So that means they were not together at the time Stacy was killed.
512	00:34:04	00:34:05	Yeah. So much for conspiracy.
513	00:34:05	00:34:07	We're right back where we started.
514	00:34:08	00:34:09	Where we are is in the crapper.
515	00:34:09	00:34:10	Look, I have to disclose the cart.
516	00:34:10	00:34:12	Defense is going to eat me alive.
517	00:34:12	00:34:13	Marlon's your guy.
518	00:34:13	00:34:16	He's your guy-- just because Hannah wasn't there doesn't mean she didn't help plan this.
519	00:34:16	00:34:21	Well, I sure hope it's Marlon, because he's the one we have on trial.
520	00:34:21	00:34:23	I stand by the case we filed.
521	00:34:23	00:34:24	I agree.
522	00:34:24	00:34:26	The girl's just trying to protect him.
523	00:34:27	00:34:29	Sara?
524	00:34:34	00:34:36	This was more about brains than brawn.
525	00:34:36	00:34:38	I think Hannah did it.
526	00:34:40	00:34:42	Two out of three.
527	00:34:42	00:34:46	In my world, that's called an acquittal.
528	00:34:54	00:34:55	High school.
529	00:34:56	00:35:01	Even if you're popular, or a jock, or a brain...
530	00:35:01	00:35:04	it can be hell.
531	00:35:04	00:35:08	Everybody here remembers what it was like...
532	00:35:08	00:35:10	what it was really like.
533	00:35:10	00:35:14	Now take a look at Marlon West.
534	00:35:14	00:35:18	Take a good, hard look.
535	00:35:20	00:35:21	Not popular...
536	00:35:22	00:35:26	not a jock... not a brain.
537	00:35:27	00:35:39	Now imagine what it must be like to be Marlon West day after day after day in the sociological pressure cooker of high school.
538	00:35:39	00:35:53	This imposing, struggling outsider like Marlon resenting someone like Stacy Vollmer, who made it look so easy to be popular, athletic and smart.
539	00:35:54	00:36:03	That strong resentment was already festering when Stacy made Marlon's sister the object of a typical high school prank.
540	00:36:05	00:36:15	And that is when Marlon, his resentment He stalked Stacy.
541	00:36:15	00:36:34	You've seen and heard evidence illustrating the elaborate pains he took to rig a shower head to torture Stacy, how he forced her to run and fall, and watched her die in a pool of her own blood.
542	00:36:34	00:36:37	You know, for the first time in his life, Marlon feels like a hero.
543	00:36:38	00:36:40	He's not invisible anymore.
544	00:36:40	00:36:43	He's a killer...
545	00:36:43	00:36:48	and he is guilty beyond all reasonable doubt.
546	00:36:49	00:36:51	Reasonable doubt.
547	00:36:51	00:37:01	You know, I'm not surprised to hear the prosecution say those words, because its case offers nothing but reasonable doubt.
548	00:37:02	00:37:04	Access to sodium?!
549	00:37:04	00:37:11	Marlon couldn't find sodium on a periodic table of the elements, let alone a locked supply closet.
550	00:37:11	00:37:14	Access to library printers?
551	00:37:14	00:37:22	Do you really think a kid like Marlon spends any time in a library?
552	00:37:22	00:37:25	The shower head-- yes, Marlon's tall enough.
553	00:37:26	00:37:39	He could reach it, but he still would have had to have handled a volatile chemical with expert safety precautions in order to orchestrate an explosion.
554	00:37:39	00:37:42	I mean, ladies and gentlemen, do you know how to do that?
555	00:37:42	00:37:45	I don't know how to do that.
556	00:37:45	00:37:48	Right? You'd have to be...
557	00:37:48	00:37:51	a genius.
558	00:37:54	00:37:56	Marlon?
559	00:37:56	00:37:59	Not a genius.
560	00:37:59	00:38:13	You know, one of the underpinnings of our justice system is that it is better to send a hundred guilty men free than to imprison even one who's innocent.
561	00:38:13	00:38:18	Marlon West is an innocent man.
562	00:38:18	00:38:25	Reasonable doubt compels you to find him not guilty.
563	00:38:53	00:38:54	Defendant shall rise.
564	00:38:56	00:39:00	Madam Foreman, what is the jury's verdict?
565	00:39:00	00:39:04	On the sole count of murder in the first degree, we, the jury, find the defendant, Marlon West...
566	00:39:05	00:39:06	not guilty.
567	00:39:12	00:39:13	So noted.
568	00:39:13	00:39:16	Court orders the defendant released from custody.
569	00:39:16	00:39:19	Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, thank you for your service.
570	00:39:19	00:39:20	Court is adjourned.
571	00:39:51	00:39:53	Sign here.
572	00:39:59	00:40:01	Hey, there.
573	00:40:01	00:40:03	Did you come to say bye?
574	00:40:03	00:40:07	No. Actually, you and I are going to be seeing a lot of each other.
575	00:40:07	00:40:11	If you thought the DA wouldn't prosecute a 12-year-old for murder, you were wrong.
576	00:40:11	00:40:13	He wants justice for Stacy and her family.
577	00:40:14	00:40:17	Of course. He's a totally linear thinker.
578	00:40:17	00:40:18	Most of you guys are.
579	00:40:18	00:40:21	Shame on you, Ms. Sidle.
580	00:40:21	00:40:22	Come on, Hannah.
581	00:40:22	00:40:23	You don't need to listen to this.
582	00:40:23	00:40:26	Mom, just give us a second.
583	00:40:33	00:40:35	You were saying?
584	00:40:37	00:40:38	Here.
585	00:40:46	00:40:53	Hannah, with your gifts, you could've done anything you wanted, and you picked murder.
586	00:40:53	00:40:55	You can't take that back.
587	00:40:56	00:40:58	You're worried how I'm going turn out.
588	00:40:58	00:41:00	Of course I am.
589	00:41:00	00:41:08	I know it seems like a really long time, but... in five years, the Stacies of the world would've been behind you.
590	00:41:09	00:41:10	Let me guess.
591	00:41:10	00:41:12	You were a smart kid in school.
592	00:41:12	00:41:14	Maybe you feel we're a little bit alike.
593	00:41:15	00:41:17	There aren't many people like you.
594	00:41:17	00:41:20	That's what my parents always say, too.
595	00:41:21	00:41:28	The last four months, all they cared about was the effect of the trial on me... not Marlon.
596	00:41:28	00:41:35	It's been that way ever since I was 14 months old and started spelling words with plastic letters.
597	00:41:35	00:41:38	It's so unfair, and nobody ever sees it.
598	00:41:40	00:41:42	He doesn't deserve to go to jail.
599	00:41:44	00:41:49	If I get convicted, what's the worst-case scenario?
600	00:41:49	00:41:53	I mean, I'll be out in five years with an undergraduate degree.
601	00:41:53	00:42:00	There's no Son of Sam law in Nevada-- that was ruled unconstitutional-- so I'm free to write a book about all this.
602	00:42:01	00:42:03	The story'll be worth millions.
603	00:42:03	00:42:05	Freaks are always good box office.
604	00:42:06	00:42:08	You're not a freak.
605	00:42:08	00:42:13	When's the last time you had to sit down to be eye-level with a murder suspect who was standing up?
606	00:42:13	00:42:15	Hannah, you are smart.
607	00:42:15	00:42:17	So I've been told.
608	00:42:17	00:42:19	But you're not smart enough to get away with murder.
609	00:42:19	00:42:21	I think I am.
610	00:42:21	00:42:24	A lot of people are smart enough to get away with murder.
611	00:42:24	00:42:26	You probably are, too.
612	00:42:26	00:42:31	But you have to be really smart to make people think things happened that never did.
613	00:42:32	00:42:35	What do you mean, exactly?
614	00:42:35	00:42:37	Please don't worry about me.
615	00:42:37	00:42:39	I'm going to be fine.
616	00:42:43	00:42:46	I didn't kill Stacy.
617	00:42:46	00:42:48	Marlon did.
