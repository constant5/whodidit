0,00:00:03,00:00:05,(siren wails in distance)
1,00:00:08,00:00:12,(heavy breathing through respirator)
2,00:00:22,00:00:25,Get a list of all the countries she's visited in the past 30 days.
3,00:00:25,00:00:28,"Yeah, her passport."
4,00:00:29,00:00:30,Try the State Department.
5,00:00:30,00:00:31,"My husband, please."
6,00:00:31,00:00:32,Yeah.
7,00:00:32,00:00:34,I have to tell my husband!
8,00:00:34,00:00:36,"Oh, please call my husband!"
9,00:01:09,00:01:12,"Ma'am, I'm sorry, but you can't go up."
10,00:01:12,00:01:14,"Catherine Willows, Crime Lab."
11,00:01:14,00:01:17,"I know who you are, but hotel rooms are under quarantine."
12,00:01:17,00:01:19,"No one goes up, no one goes down."
13,00:01:19,00:01:21,Quarantine?
14,00:01:44,00:01:45,"Okay, David."
15,00:01:52,00:01:53,False alarm.
16,00:01:53,00:01:54,We're clear.
17,00:02:04,00:02:05,VARTANN: Hey.
18,00:02:05,00:02:06,Hi.
19,00:02:12,00:02:15,Someone want to fill me in here?
20,00:02:15,00:02:21,"David assessed a potentially infectious agent, and per protocol, he remained at the site and called it in."
21,00:02:21,00:02:23,Her red blotches are consistent with CDC photos of Ebola.
22,00:02:23,00:02:25,ROBBINS: You did the right thing.
23,00:02:25,00:02:28,So what are we looking at?
24,00:02:28,00:02:32,"Um, 419, suspicious circs."
25,00:02:32,00:02:36,"Honestly, I have no idea."
26,00:02:36,00:02:40,"Okay, it's my turn now."
27,00:02:40,00:02:42,Clear the scene.
28,00:03:27,00:03:28,Sorry I'm late.
29,00:03:28,00:03:30,I was processing the scene.
30,00:03:30,00:03:31,Nothing probative.
31,00:03:31,00:03:35,There are 42 distinct laser burns on Julie Stern's body.
32,00:03:35,00:03:36,Lasers?
33,00:03:36,00:03:39,Lasers cauterize the skin as they destroy tissue.
34,00:03:39,00:03:45,"Lack of blood and scabbing confirms their use, so best guess would be she recently underwent a cosmetic procedure."
35,00:03:45,00:03:49,(zapping)
36,00:03:51,00:03:54,That's consistent with the hotel manager's statement.
37,00:03:54,00:03:56,Said the vic had booked into the Safari Suite.
38,00:03:56,00:04:00,Please tell me that has nothing to do with hunting wild game.
39,00:04:00,00:04:06,Women who... don't want their friends to know that they're freshening up will check into the suite while they heal.
40,00:04:06,00:04:09,"Well, five-star hotel's got to be cheaper than a hospital stay."
41,00:04:09,00:04:12,"So, could complications from this procedure have resulted in her death?"
42,00:04:12,00:04:14,No.
43,00:04:14,00:04:16,Histamine levels are normal.
44,00:04:17,00:04:19,There's no post-op infection.
45,00:04:19,00:04:21,But look at her fingernails.
46,00:04:21,00:04:26,WILLOWS: Mees lines; indicative of heavy metal poisoning.
47,00:04:26,00:04:28,I sent blood and hair samples to Tox.
48,00:04:28,00:04:29,Anything else?
49,00:04:29,00:04:33,"I'm not sure if it's probative, but I found ten cc's of urine in her stomach."
50,00:04:33,00:04:35,Digestive system's intact.
51,00:04:35,00:04:41,"There are no bruises or abrasions in her mouth, so there's only one way it could have gotten there."
52,00:04:41,00:04:42,Chugalug.
53,00:04:42,00:04:43,Mm-hmm.
54,00:04:54,00:04:56,Okay.
55,00:04:56,00:04:59,So two days ago the residence was tented for termites.
56,00:04:59,00:05:01,"This morning, the bug guys came to clear the house."
57,00:05:01,00:05:04,They found the homeowner exterminated.
58,00:05:04,00:05:08,"He's ID'd as Elliot Beckman, 42, lived alone."
59,00:05:08,00:05:09,Body's in the family room.
60,00:05:09,00:05:10,Who's been inside?
61,00:05:10,00:05:12,Just the exterminators and the paramedics who pronounced.
62,00:05:13,00:05:15,They entered and exited through the front door.
63,00:05:15,00:05:16,Good luck.
64,00:05:24,00:05:27,Exterminators use sulfuryl flouride.
65,00:05:27,00:05:30,It kills the bugs and then evaporates.
66,00:05:30,00:05:32,"Agro scientists call it the ""safety"" fumigant."
67,00:05:32,00:05:34,"You know, I'm sure he would disagree."
68,00:05:39,00:05:42,(crunches)
69,00:05:45,00:05:47,Eyeglasses on the floor.
70,00:05:50,00:05:52,Got vomit?
71,00:05:52,00:05:54,(gas hissing)
72,00:05:54,00:05:56,(gagging)
73,00:06:23,00:06:26,What flies when they're on and floats when they're off?
74,00:06:26,00:06:27,Feathers.
75,00:06:27,00:06:30,Long and blue.
76,00:06:30,00:06:31,I'll bag 'em.
77,00:06:33,00:06:35,His cheek is bruised.
78,00:06:35,00:06:38,What was he doing in here?
79,00:06:38,00:06:42,"Per the R&amp;R's, we conducted a thorough walk-through before releasing the gas."
80,00:06:42,00:06:45,"No plants, people or animals were left behind."
81,00:06:45,00:06:47,"All right, so you released the gas, then what?"
82,00:06:47,00:06:48,I took off.
83,00:06:48,00:06:50,"Can't stick around baby-sitting houses, you know?"
84,00:06:50,00:06:55,"Once you left the house, could Beckman have snuck back in in any way?"
85,00:06:55,00:06:56,"Yeah, if he had a death wish."
86,00:06:56,00:06:58,The house is toxic for the first 12 hours.
87,00:06:58,00:07:01,Mm-hmm. Not to mention it gets wrapped up tighter than a Christmas present.
88,00:07:01,00:07:04,You know tented houses-- they're prime targets for burglars.
89,00:07:04,00:07:08,We secure these on the outside of every doorknob.
90,00:07:08,00:07:10,Clamshell locks.
91,00:07:10,00:07:11,Nobody gets inside.
92,00:07:11,00:07:12,"Yeah, says you."
93,00:07:16,00:07:19,"Yes, Ms. Stern was in my care."
94,00:07:19,00:07:22,"And when was the last time you saw her, Dr. Malaga?"
95,00:07:22,00:07:26,"Uh, I ablated her liver spots three days ago."
96,00:07:26,00:07:29,Checked on her yesterday at The Mediterranean.
97,00:07:29,00:07:33,I applied post-op ointment to prevent scabbing and infection.
98,00:07:36,00:07:38,"She seemed, uh..."
99,00:07:38,00:07:41,in good spirits.
100,00:07:42,00:07:46,"From the marks, it looks like you lasered over 40 spots."
101,00:07:46,00:07:47,In one session?
102,00:07:47,00:07:50,"Well, post op, the patient's skin is very red and raw."
103,00:07:50,00:07:54,"It's really quite ugly, to be blunt."
104,00:07:54,00:07:58,Most patients prefer to minimize the amount of time they spend in recovery.
105,00:07:58,00:08:00,So you supersized the procedure.
106,00:08:00,00:08:02,You did it all in one sitting?
107,00:08:02,00:08:03,It's perfectly safe.
108,00:08:03,00:08:05,We'll need a copy of her medical records.
109,00:08:05,00:08:07,Okay?
110,00:08:07,00:08:12,"Oh, I'm sorry, but her file contains medical history which includes information about other members of the family."
111,00:08:12,00:08:17,I would be breaching doctor-patient confidentiality if I let you have that.
112,00:08:24,00:08:30,"Hey, uh, do you have a problem with me, Doctor?"
113,00:08:30,00:08:31,Excuse me?
114,00:08:32,00:08:35,"Well, there are two of us here and you're only addressing my colleague, so..."
115,00:08:37,00:08:39,"Well, she's a very beautiful woman."
116,00:08:40,00:08:44,You have Venus de Miloaesthetics.
117,00:08:48,00:08:51,We'll be getting a court order for Ms. Stern's records.
118,00:08:51,00:08:53,I'd appreciate that.
119,00:09:10,00:09:11,Sara.
120,00:09:14,00:09:16,Looks like someone tampered with the tent.
121,00:09:18,00:09:20,Window's open.
122,00:09:20,00:09:26,"Well, exterminators leave some windows open to help circulate the gas."
123,00:09:26,00:09:28,This could have been the victim's way in.
124,00:09:32,00:09:35,"Once inside, he was overcome by the fumes."
125,00:09:41,00:09:43,(gas hissing)
126,00:09:44,00:09:45,(gagging)
127,00:09:46,00:09:49,He must be an idiot to go inside a tented house.
128,00:09:49,00:09:51,Maybe he forgot something.
129,00:09:51,00:09:52,Figured the gas had dissipated.
130,00:09:52,00:09:57,"Well, assuming you're right, and he went in and never left, shouldn't the window be open wider?"
131,00:10:03,00:10:05,It's old. The rope has snapped.
132,00:10:05,00:10:06,Okay.
133,00:10:06,00:10:10,"Now, Mr. Beckman never came out of the house."
134,00:10:10,00:10:17,Why is there a trail of sand leading away from it and straight to the neighbor's house?
135,00:10:17,00:10:18,That's a good question.
136,00:10:28,00:10:31,(knocking)
137,00:10:31,00:10:32,(man coughing)
138,00:10:36,00:10:37,Can I help you?
139,00:10:38,00:10:39,"Yeah, we're with the crime lab."
140,00:10:39,00:10:41,We're investigating the death of your neighbor next door.
141,00:10:42,00:10:43,Elliot?
142,00:10:43,00:10:44,What happened?
143,00:10:44,00:10:46,That's what we're trying to figure out.
144,00:10:47,00:10:49,(coughing)
145,00:10:50,00:10:52,Have you been in his house recently?
146,00:10:53,00:10:56,"Look, man, I've been laid up for the past two days puking my guts out."
147,00:10:56,00:10:57,I haven't left my place.
148,00:10:57,00:10:58,"Do you live alone, Mr...?"
149,00:10:59,00:11:01,Rory Kendell.
150,00:11:01,00:11:02,My wife bailed a few months ago.
151,00:11:02,00:11:05,"Rory, have you felt dizzy or disoriented?"
152,00:11:05,00:11:07,How would you know?
153,00:11:07,00:11:08,We're going to need a urine sample.
154,00:11:08,00:11:09,Why?
155,00:11:09,00:11:12,You may be suffering from sulfuryl flouride gas poisoning.
156,00:11:12,00:11:14,Urination's the only way for the poison to get out.
157,00:11:15,00:11:15,I got the flu.
158,00:11:16,00:11:19,"If that's true, then your urine will be sulfuryl-flouride free."
159,00:11:19,00:11:23,"But if you're lying, ""you're in"" big trouble."
160,00:11:32,00:11:36,"What do Ozzy Osbourne, Iron Maiden and our victim all have in common?"
161,00:11:36,00:11:37,Heavy metal.
162,00:11:37,00:11:40,"Arsenic in her system, poisoning was chronic."
163,00:11:40,00:11:44,Looks like it began approximately three months ago.
164,00:11:45,00:11:47,Techs collected the ingestibles found at her home.
165,00:11:47,00:11:48,None were contaminated.
166,00:11:48,00:11:51,Can Tox confirm that arsenic poisoning was the cause of death?
167,00:11:51,00:11:55,"Not yet. Until the quants come back, we won't know if the concentration was lethal."
168,00:11:55,00:11:57,"In poisoning cases, the killer's usually a relative."
169,00:11:57,00:11:58,Right.
170,00:11:58,00:12:00,Someone with access to the victim.
171,00:12:00,00:12:04,"Next-of-kin is an only child, a son."
172,00:12:04,00:12:07,Who has a vineyard in Pahrump.
173,00:12:07,00:12:09,You sent a cop all the way to Pahrump to bring me in.
174,00:12:09,00:12:11,What couldn't we discuss on the phone?
175,00:12:11,00:12:15,When's the last time you saw your mother?
176,00:12:16,00:12:19,It was about three months ago.
177,00:12:19,00:12:21,She came to my vineyard for a visit.
178,00:12:21,00:12:22,How'd that go?
179,00:12:22,00:12:22,She left early.
180,00:12:23,00:12:24,Said she felt sick.
181,00:12:24,00:12:27,But you didn't think so.
182,00:12:28,00:12:30,Mom was uncomfortable around my four-year-old.
183,00:12:31,00:12:32,Why's that?
184,00:12:32,00:12:34,He made her feel old.
185,00:12:34,00:12:37,"""Grandma"" was a dirty word."
186,00:12:37,00:12:39,She could hardly look at him.
187,00:12:39,00:12:40,"Nice, huh?"
188,00:12:40,00:12:46,"Mr. Stern, I also did a background check and you recently maxed out three credit cards."
189,00:12:46,00:12:49,My vines contracted black rot last spring.
190,00:12:49,00:12:51,It's an expensive problem.
191,00:12:51,00:12:52,Why are you checking my credit?
192,00:12:52,00:12:55,"You're weren't worried about paying off your debt, were you?"
193,00:12:55,00:12:56,What the hell are you implying?
194,00:12:56,00:12:57,You're about to come into some money.
195,00:12:57,00:13:00,"When my dad died, he left my mother boatloads of cash."
196,00:13:00,00:13:02,"On her last visit, I asked her for a loan."
197,00:13:02,00:13:04,Let me guess-- she turned you down.
198,00:13:04,00:13:07,"She'd spend thousands on designer clothes, jewelry, plastic surgery..."
199,00:13:07,00:13:09,but wouldn't lend me a dime.
200,00:13:11,00:13:14,Do you use pesticides on your grapevines?
201,00:13:14,00:13:16,Yeah. Organic's a fad.
202,00:13:16,00:13:18,We're going to need a sample of that.
203,00:13:18,00:13:19,Whatever.
204,00:13:19,00:13:20,We done?
205,00:13:22,00:13:25,This one's easy-- he drowned.
206,00:13:25,00:13:27,What?
207,00:13:27,00:13:32,The termite fumigant entered his bronchioles causing his lungs to fill with fluid.
208,00:13:32,00:13:36,COD is pulmonary edema and respiratory arrest.
209,00:13:36,00:13:38,Just like a drowning victim.
210,00:13:38,00:13:42,"Doc, tell me about the bruise on his cheek."
211,00:13:42,00:13:46,Zygoma's fractured. Check the X-ray.
212,00:13:46,00:13:56,"Given the force needed to cause this type of damage, the injury's more consistent with inflicted blunt force trauma than a simple fall, if that's what you're asking."
213,00:13:57,00:14:03,"Arsenic is the active ingredient in the vineyard pesticide, but you're ruling it out as the source of the poisoning?"
214,00:14:03,00:14:06,The pesticide is a copper-arsenate mix.
215,00:14:06,00:14:09,It's chemically different than the arsenic ingested by Ms. Stern.
216,00:14:09,00:14:13,"And, FYI, that pesticide was outlawed by the EPA years ago."
217,00:14:13,00:14:15,This guy is poisoning the soil.
218,00:14:15,00:14:17,"So he's not a killer, he's a polluter."
219,00:14:17,00:14:19,"He should still be arrested, if you ask me."
220,00:14:19,00:14:23,People are saying that you found urine in the vic's stomach.
221,00:14:23,00:14:25,Not sure if it's hinky or kinky.
222,00:14:27,00:14:33,"When I used to play ball for the Stars, we would pee on our palms during spring training to toughen them up, you know."
223,00:14:33,00:14:37,Remind me never to shake your hand.
224,00:14:37,00:14:39,I'll put on a glove first.
225,00:14:39,00:14:42,That's always a good idea.
226,00:14:46,00:14:47,Just came from Tox.
227,00:14:47,00:14:50,Rory Kendell's urine analysis is still pending.
228,00:14:50,00:14:53,"I know we're not supposed to get ahead of the evidence here, but if he's not guilty..."
229,00:14:53,00:14:57,I lifted several prints off the clamps you found by the open window.
230,00:14:57,00:14:59,I AFIS-matched them to a neighbor.
231,00:14:59,00:15:01,The guy's on file for a D&amp;D in '82.
232,00:15:01,00:15:03,"It's Rory, right."
233,00:15:03,00:15:04,No. Zach Alfano.
234,00:15:04,00:15:05,Who?
235,00:15:05,00:15:07,He's the neighbor on the other side.
236,00:15:07,00:15:08,I called his house.
237,00:15:08,00:15:11,His daughter said he was picked up in an ambulance two days ago.
238,00:15:11,00:15:14,"Apparently, he was vomiting, he couldn't breathe, he passed out."
239,00:15:14,00:15:16,Brass is taking a statement.
240,00:15:16,00:15:18,He's still in the hospital.
241,00:15:18,00:15:21,BRASS: So why didn't you contact the police?
242,00:15:21,00:15:22,I had... (clears throat)
243,00:15:22,00:15:25,(speaking hoarsely): I had a tube down my throat till a half hour ago.
244,00:15:25,00:15:29,"All right, let me get this straight-- so you came in from a run and then what happened?"
245,00:15:29,00:15:31,I heard screaming from inside the house.
246,00:15:31,00:15:34,(screaming)
247,00:15:38,00:15:42,"By the time I got to Beckman, he'd already passed out."
248,00:15:42,00:15:48,"I started to choke on the gas, so I got out of there."
249,00:15:48,00:15:51,"Ran to my neighbor's house, Rory Kendell's, for help."
250,00:15:51,00:15:52,(doorbell rings)
251,00:15:55,00:15:58,I remember my daughter calling 911.
252,00:15:58,00:16:01,Next thing I know...
253,00:16:01,00:16:02,I'm here.
254,00:16:02,00:16:04,(coughs)
255,00:16:35,00:16:39,"The print on the doorbell is a match to Zach, and I found vomit in the bushes."
256,00:16:39,00:16:41,Both support his account.
257,00:16:41,00:16:42,Sara?
258,00:16:42,00:16:44,We missed something.
259,00:16:44,00:16:45,What?
260,00:16:45,00:16:47,The directionality of the floor rug.
261,00:16:47,00:16:50,The center of the rug is pointing towards the side window.
262,00:16:50,00:16:54,Also confirms Zach Alfano's story.
263,00:16:54,00:16:56,We're back to Rory Kendell.
264,00:16:56,00:17:01,"If he didn't leave the house for two days, how come he didn't answer the door when Zach Alfano rang the bell?"
265,00:17:01,00:17:03,I was sick.
266,00:17:04,00:17:06,I figured it was some Girl Scout selling cookies.
267,00:17:06,00:17:09,We got back the results of your urine analysis.
268,00:17:09,00:17:11,There was sulfuryl fluoride in your system.
269,00:17:12,00:17:13,You were at Elliot's house.
270,00:17:13,00:17:15,No.
271,00:17:15,00:17:19,"Here's a thought-- after the exterminators left, you met up with Elliot."
272,00:17:19,00:17:23,"You had a fight, you knocked him out, and you dragged him into the house through the side window."
273,00:17:23,00:17:27,"You figured the fumigation would cover your tracks, that we'd chalk it up to an accident."
274,00:17:27,00:17:29,Why would I want to kill Elliot?
275,00:17:30,00:17:32,You've had five noise complaints against him last year.
276,00:17:32,00:17:34,That's hardly reason to kill somebody.
277,00:17:34,00:17:35,Or is it a reason to commit assault?
278,00:17:35,00:17:37,He filed charges against you last May.
279,00:17:38,00:17:42,"I knocked on his door, and I asked him to turn down that classical crap."
280,00:17:42,00:17:44,He refused.
281,00:17:44,00:17:46,I overreacted.
282,00:17:47,00:17:48,I apologized.
283,00:17:48,00:17:51,Charges were dropped.
284,00:17:51,00:17:52,I swear.
285,00:17:52,00:17:55,Save the swearing for trial. You're under arrest.
286,00:17:55,00:17:56,(coughs)
287,00:17:58,00:18:01,"DR. ROBBINS: Renita Loakes, 38, from Seven Hills."
288,00:18:01,00:18:02,New case.
289,00:18:02,00:18:04,Started as a routine autopsy.
290,00:18:04,00:18:08,"She was shopping at the Venetian, keeled over at Lacoste."
291,00:18:08,00:18:16,"Physically, she was in excellent condition, so I figured spontaneous aortic dissection or maybe pulmonary embolism."
292,00:18:16,00:18:17,Then I noticed Mees Lines.
293,00:18:21,00:18:24,Ah... just like Julie Stern.
294,00:18:30,00:18:37,"I spotted the tiny pinpricks on her face, so I painted her with Toluidine Blue to highlight the marks."
295,00:18:40,00:18:42,Have a look at this.
296,00:18:42,00:18:44,Now check out Renita's face.
297,00:18:56,00:18:58,An exact match.
298,00:18:58,00:19:03,It's an acupuncture facial designed to reduce the signs of aging.
299,00:19:13,00:19:19,"For only the second time in my career, in the space of two days, I found urine in the decedent's stomach."
300,00:19:19,00:19:21,That's more than a coincidence.
301,00:19:21,00:19:28,"Two women, both fighting the toll of time, die prematurely."
302,00:19:28,00:19:30,Why?
303,00:19:35,00:19:37,This is Renita's apartment.
304,00:19:37,00:19:38,Thanks. You bet.
305,00:19:46,00:19:49,Dr. Robbins did say Renita was in good shape.
306,00:20:13,00:20:34,"""Supplement Diary."" ""Daily Youth Regimen: ""Coenzyme Q-10-- 50 mg; ""Bee Pollen-- 500 mg; ""Grape Seed-- 200 mg; ""Deer Antler Drops; ""Chinese Mountain Ant Extract; Tincture of Wild Reishi."" And that's just for breakfast."
307,00:20:34,00:20:36,How'd she have room for pancakes?
308,00:20:38,00:20:42,Do you think these supplements really do any good?
309,00:20:42,00:20:44,Why are you asking me?
310,00:20:45,00:20:48,"I'm just asking a question, Catherine."
311,00:20:50,00:20:53,"Scientifically, there's not a whole lot of evidence."
312,00:21:15,00:21:16,(sighing)
313,00:21:16,00:21:18,More lotions and potions.
314,00:21:18,00:21:22,"You gonna ask me if this stuff works, too?"
315,00:21:22,00:21:25,No. I'm gonna process the bathroom.
316,00:21:39,00:21:40,(camera shutter clicking)
317,00:21:40,00:21:41,"Hey, Catherine."
318,00:21:42,00:21:43,Yeah?
319,00:21:44,00:21:46,You might want to come take a look at this.
320,00:21:57,00:22:01,Urine in the bedpan and in the glass.
321,00:22:11,00:22:13,She liked it fresh.
322,00:22:23,00:22:24,How's it going?
323,00:22:25,00:22:28,Ornithological database just ID'd the feathers I collected at the crime scene.
324,00:22:29,00:22:31,Hyacinth macaw.
325,00:22:31,00:22:35,So how come you and Brass didn't involve me in the interrogation?
326,00:22:35,00:22:42,"Greg, you still have the solo to complete, and, technically, you're still a trainee, but you're doing a great job."
327,00:22:42,00:22:44,Thanks.
328,00:23:25,00:23:28,What are you doing with potassium nitrate?
329,00:23:28,00:23:31,I'm making a bomb.
330,00:23:31,00:23:33,Two bombs actually.
331,00:23:34,00:23:36,And sugar.
332,00:23:36,00:23:38,You're making sweet bombs?
333,00:23:38,00:23:39,I'm making smoke bombs.
334,00:23:39,00:23:41,Ready?
335,00:23:45,00:23:46,"One, two, three."
336,00:24:29,00:24:31,Grissom.
337,00:24:31,00:24:33,We got smoke.
338,00:24:33,00:24:37,Coming from an uncapped electrical conduit.
339,00:24:41,00:24:43,"SIDLE: Hey, I found it!"
340,00:24:43,00:24:46,It's right behind the speaker.
341,00:24:46,00:24:49,Music traveled through the conduit directly into Rory's house.
342,00:24:49,00:24:51,No wonder he was so pissed off.
343,00:24:51,00:24:55,"At one time, both houses must've been connected to the same electrical meter."
344,00:24:55,00:24:58,A single property.
345,00:24:58,00:24:59,How did you figure that?
346,00:24:59,00:25:02,We found fumigant in Rory Kendell's urine.
347,00:25:02,00:25:04,But he claimed he was never in the victim's house.
348,00:25:04,00:25:07,So you devised the experiment to prove he was lying?
349,00:25:07,00:25:09,Exactly. He was telling the truth.
350,00:25:09,00:25:11,So now what?
351,00:25:11,00:25:13,So you're the last one to see Elliot Beckman alive.
352,00:25:14,00:25:15,So did he drive away from his house?
353,00:25:15,00:25:17,"Oh, we saw him walk away."
354,00:25:17,00:25:22,"His, uh, his car was in the shop or something. He was staying down at some motel down the street."
355,00:25:22,00:25:23,And that's the last time you saw him?
356,00:25:24,00:25:25,Yeah. No.
357,00:25:26,00:25:29,"Ted is our, our gas-man, so he stayed behind to release the fumigants."
358,00:25:29,00:25:31,I headed on over to the next job.
359,00:25:31,00:25:36,"Saw the dude on the side of the road, so I-I gave him a lift to the motel."
360,00:25:36,00:25:38,(chuckling): That bird crapped in my truck.
361,00:25:38,00:25:41,Can you describe the bird?
362,00:25:41,00:25:43,It was blue.
363,00:25:43,00:25:45,What motel?
364,00:25:45,00:25:49,"Uh, Four Aces, down there on Boulder Highway and Water Street."
365,00:25:49,00:25:54,Does it ever bother you that you make your living killing insects?
366,00:25:56,00:25:58,What kind of question is that?
367,00:25:59,00:26:03,"WILLOWS: ""If you believe in me, you will never thirst."
368,00:26:03,00:26:06,"""Rivers of living water shall flow from your bellies."
369,00:26:06,00:26:11,"John 7:38."" You getting religious on me?"
370,00:26:11,00:26:18,"Apparently, some fringe health professionals have used the biblical passage as justification for Urine Therapy."
371,00:26:18,00:26:20,Drinking your own pee?
372,00:26:20,00:26:29,"I ran an Amazon search, I found 15 books touting urine's supposed health benefits, including its magical powers to reduce the signs of aging. Listen to this."
373,00:26:29,00:26:32,"It is a perversion of medicine, not to mention the Bible."
374,00:26:32,00:26:33,I don't get it.
375,00:26:33,00:26:36,"These women-- the time, the pain, the effort."
376,00:26:36,00:26:39,For what? Smoother skin? Please.
377,00:26:39,00:26:41,"Make a muscle, Nicky."
378,00:26:41,00:26:43,What?
379,00:26:43,00:26:45,"Roll up your sleeve, make a muscle."
380,00:26:48,00:26:49,(clearing throat)
381,00:26:54,00:26:56,Oh.
382,00:26:56,00:26:59,"Now, how much time and effort went into this?"
383,00:26:59,00:27:05,"I'm gonna guess five days a week a the gym, low carb, low fat, slow burn, and for what, Nicky?"
384,00:27:05,00:27:06,For what?
385,00:27:07,00:27:09,"That's a good point, but it's not the same thing."
386,00:27:09,00:27:11,"No. It's nice, though."
387,00:27:11,00:27:12,"Well, thanks, I'm not even flexing it yet either."
388,00:27:12,00:27:14,Really? But it's rock hard.
389,00:27:14,00:27:15,(clearing throat)
390,00:27:16,00:27:19,"Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt... barge in."
391,00:27:19,00:27:21,"I... normally would've knocked, but the door isn't..."
392,00:27:21,00:27:25,"No, no, it's all right, Super Dave. Nice purse."
393,00:27:26,00:27:28,"Oh, uh... paramedics just delivered it."
394,00:27:28,00:27:32,Got separated from Ms. Loakes when she was loaded into the ambulance.
395,00:27:32,00:27:33,Anything else?
396,00:27:33,00:27:35,"Oh, no, no."
397,00:27:35,00:27:36,"Thanks, David."
398,00:27:36,00:27:37,Sure.

401,00:28:06,00:28:17,"""For refills, contact Dr. Malaga."" This is a doctor's office?"
402,00:28:17,00:28:21,"According to Vartann, Dr. Malaga bought the spa two years ago and incorporated his practice."
403,00:28:21,00:28:23,"Hi, and welcome to the Sagebrush Spa."
404,00:28:24,00:28:25,Thanks. I'm Nick Stokes. This is Catherine Willows.
405,00:28:25,00:28:26,We're with the Crime Lab.
406,00:28:26,00:28:27,We're here to see Dr. Malaga.
407,00:28:28,00:28:30,Is he expecting you?
408,00:28:30,00:28:31,Just tell him we're here.
409,00:28:33,00:28:35,Dr. Malaga.
410,00:28:35,00:28:39,Botox injections-- 500 bucks.
411,00:28:39,00:28:41,Restaylane injections-- 500.
412,00:28:41,00:28:44,Micropeel-- 300. Whew.
413,00:28:44,00:28:46,That's my car payment.
414,00:28:48,00:28:52,"STOKES: You don't actually think you need this stuff, do you?"
415,00:28:52,00:28:54,"It's Vegas, Nicky. Everybody needs it."

418,00:29:04,00:29:06,Let's go to my office.
419,00:29:09,00:29:14,You sold Dorian Spray to both Renita Loakes and Julie Stern.
420,00:29:14,00:29:18,"Yeah. It's my own formulation, and I can assure you that it's perfectly safe."
421,00:29:18,00:29:20,"Doctor, you are aware that arsenic is a poison, right?"
422,00:29:20,00:29:22,So is Botox.
423,00:29:22,00:29:25,But 2.2 million people had injections last year.
424,00:29:25,00:29:29,And Foxglove is a deadly plant that also doubles as a cardiac medication.
425,00:29:29,00:29:30,I'm familiar with Digitalis.
426,00:29:31,00:29:36,"Well, arsenic, in extremely small doses, fights premature aging by improving skin elasticity."
427,00:29:40,00:29:48,"Look, even if Ms. Loakes and Ms. Stern drank a whole case of that spray, the arsenic content wouldn't be lethal."
428,00:29:50,00:29:52,"Well, they teach you about arsenic in medical school?"
429,00:29:52,00:29:55,I did a course in holistic medicine a couple of years ago.
430,00:29:55,00:29:58,Did you also take a course in spa management?
431,00:29:59,00:30:08,"Medical school left me with a lot of debts and with HMOs cutting their fees, my practice was barely breaking even."
432,00:30:08,00:30:11,"You know, th-the whole profession is changing."
433,00:30:11,00:30:13,(keys tapping)
434,00:30:13,00:30:15,Doctors have to seek out their patients.
435,00:30:15,00:30:23,"The HMOs don't recognize aging as a disease, so I'm free to charge whatever the market will bear."
436,00:30:23,00:30:25,Hang on.
437,00:30:25,00:30:28,You consider aging a disease?
438,00:30:30,00:30:34,With a 100% mortality rate.
439,00:30:34,00:30:43,"Aging wreaks havoc with every one of our systems: respiratory, cardiovascular, nervous, musculoskeletal and immune."
440,00:30:43,00:30:45,But you're not treating the body.
441,00:30:45,00:30:47,You're battling crow's feet.
442,00:30:47,00:30:50,Righteous indignation.
443,00:30:50,00:30:53,That's one step before acceptance.
444,00:30:53,00:30:55,Acceptance of what?
445,00:30:55,00:30:56,What I do.
446,00:30:56,00:31:01,"The, uh... procedures and products."
447,00:31:01,00:31:04,You've seen the ads in all the beauty magazines.
448,00:31:04,00:31:07,You've studied all the before and after photos.
449,00:31:07,00:31:10,"It's okay, Ms. Willows."
450,00:31:10,00:31:16,"We'll all get older, and nobody wants to look their age."
451,00:31:17,00:31:19,I give you what you need.
452,00:31:19,00:31:21,I give you what you want.
453,00:31:26,00:31:28,"So, what Ponce de Leon couldn't find, you did, huh?"
454,00:31:29,00:31:30,The fountain of youth.
455,00:31:30,00:31:32,Snake oil in a fancy bottle.
456,00:31:32,00:31:35,Medicine is about hope.
457,00:31:35,00:31:38,"And like any good doctor, that's what I sell."
458,00:31:38,00:31:40,Medicine is about healing.
459,00:31:40,00:31:42,Hope is about prayer.
460,00:31:42,00:31:44,That should be free.
461,00:31:46,00:31:50,We need Ms. Sterns' and Ms. Loakes' medical records.
462,00:31:50,00:31:53,"And, uh, this time, we've got a court order."
463,00:31:58,00:32:02,"Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, I presume?"
464,00:32:02,00:32:03,"What do you need, Brass?"
465,00:32:03,00:32:06,"Well, it may be elementary, but I have a conundrum."
466,00:32:06,00:32:08,I just got back from the Four Aces.
467,00:32:08,00:32:11,The hotel manager said Elliot tried to check in with his bird.
468,00:32:11,00:32:19,"The guy turned him down because he didn't have a cage, so supposedly Elliot went home to retrieve it, but neither he nor the bird ever returned."
469,00:32:19,00:32:23,Looks like we need to find that bird.
470,00:32:35,00:32:38,(flies buzzing)
471,00:32:40,00:32:42,Greg.
472,00:32:44,00:32:46,(flies buzzing)
473,00:32:46,00:32:48,Oh.
474,00:32:48,00:32:50,There were no flies in here when we processed the house.
475,00:32:50,00:32:59,"Fumigation kills all household insects, and it takes time for new flies to find a portal of entry."
476,00:33:00,00:33:02,(sniffing)
477,00:33:02,00:33:04,"Well, bird could've flown up somewhere and died."
478,00:33:06,00:33:08,(flies buzzing)
479,00:33:29,00:33:32,Carcass with a fresh colony of maggots.
480,00:33:32,00:33:33,(clearing throat)
481,00:33:33,00:33:35,The bird's not here; it's a dead rat.
482,00:33:35,00:33:39,Which means the macaw was either birdknapped or he flew the coop.
483,00:33:42,00:33:43,MAN (singsong voice): I love you.
484,00:33:43,00:33:46,"I love you, I love you... I love you."
485,00:33:46,00:33:48,(clucks tongue)
486,00:33:48,00:33:50,(whistling)
487,00:33:51,00:33:54,I love you. I love you.
488,00:33:55,00:33:57,I love you.
489,00:33:57,00:33:58,Teaching him to speak?
490,00:33:58,00:34:02,"Although the cockatoo is intelligent, birds don'tspeak."
491,00:34:02,00:34:08,"To speak requires a cognitive ability to understand, which they don't."
492,00:34:08,00:34:10,They just imitate.
493,00:34:10,00:34:12,And Edweena is a she.
494,00:34:12,00:34:14,How can I help you?
495,00:34:14,00:34:17,I'm looking for a macaw.
496,00:34:17,00:34:19,"Well, you came to the right place."
497,00:34:19,00:34:22,Buy Buy Birdie's the only exotic bird store in Clark County.
498,00:34:23,00:34:25,Has anyone tried to sell you a macaw in the last few days?
499,00:34:25,00:34:27,No. Why?
500,00:34:27,00:34:29,"Well, I'm trying to locate a missing Blue Hyacinth."
501,00:34:29,00:34:30,Very rare.
502,00:34:31,00:34:34,"In my whole career, I've only sold one."
503,00:34:34,00:34:36,Do you remember the buyer's name?
504,00:34:36,00:34:37,Sure. Mr. Beckman.
505,00:34:37,00:34:39,He's in here all the time.
506,00:34:39,00:34:41,Bob likes to eat cashews out of my pocket.
507,00:34:41,00:34:43,Mr. Beckman doesn't go anywhere without Bob.
508,00:34:43,00:34:49,"Mr. Beckman, um, died three days ago."
509,00:34:49,00:34:52,We found these...
510,00:34:52,00:34:55,feathers in his house.
511,00:34:55,00:34:57,Tail feathers.
512,00:34:57,00:34:58,That's not good.
513,00:34:59,00:35:00,Why is that?
514,00:35:00,00:35:02,Macaws only molt one tail feather at a time.
515,00:35:02,00:35:06,"Get a pile like this, someone yanked."
516,00:35:06,00:35:08,Real hard.
517,00:35:10,00:35:13,"So, Dr. Malaga was telling the truth-- both women were poisoned."
518,00:35:14,00:35:15,But that's not what killed them.
519,00:35:16,00:35:19,"Yeah, so we can rule out arsenic as a cause of death."
520,00:35:19,00:35:21,"Hey, Travis?"
521,00:35:21,00:35:24,"These are the vials from our decedents, right?"
522,00:35:24,00:35:27,"Yeah, I just finished with them yesterday."
523,00:35:27,00:35:30,Why?
524,00:35:30,00:35:33,"Well, the red blood cells haven't separated from the serum."
525,00:35:33,00:35:34,Is that relevant?
526,00:35:34,00:35:40,"Maybe. I mean, normally, we'd see a yellow band of serum on top of the crimson blood."
527,00:35:40,00:35:43,These vials are solid crimson.
528,00:35:43,00:35:46,Which means the red blood cells have lysed.
529,00:35:46,00:35:49,"Something caused the red blood cells to lyse, or pop."
530,00:35:49,00:35:53,The hemoglobin from inside those cells infiltrated the serum.
531,00:35:53,00:35:58,"If a sufficient number of red blood cells lyse, a person dies."
532,00:35:58,00:36:00,"So, what caused the lysis?"
533,00:36:00,00:36:03,"We answer that question, we solve this case."
534,00:36:03,00:36:05,"CATHERINE: So, the women were 30 years apart in age."
535,00:36:05,00:36:07,They lived on different sides of town.
536,00:36:07,00:36:09,They probably didn't know each other.
537,00:36:09,00:36:13,But they both drank their own urine and were patients of Dr. Malaga's.
538,00:36:13,00:36:17,"Well, were either one of their procedures sufficiently invasive as to compromise their blood?"
539,00:36:17,00:36:27,"Well, last Monday, two days before liver spot removal, Ms. Stern had a body wrap and... hydrogen peroxide therapy."
540,00:36:27,00:36:30,Ms. Loakes also underwent hydrogen peroxide therapy...
541,00:36:31,00:36:32,on the same day?
542,00:36:32,00:36:37,Here's the menu of services provided by the spa.
543,00:36:37,00:36:38,Let's see...
544,00:36:38,00:36:51,"""Hydrogen Peroxide Therapy-- a three percent solution ""is injected directly into a client's vein, ""bathing the red blood cells in nourishing oxygen, ""boosting the immune system and reversing the signs of aging."" Question is, is it deadly?"
545,00:36:51,00:36:54,"Well, let's find out. I'll get the hydrogen peroxide."
546,00:36:54,00:36:55,I'll get the blood.
547,00:36:55,00:36:57,Okay.
548,00:37:37,00:37:39,(knocking on door)
549,00:37:41,00:37:43,(clears throat)
550,00:37:44,00:37:48,"Mr. Martin, we have a warrant to search your apartment."
551,00:37:48,00:37:50,"Please, stay with me."
552,00:37:50,00:37:52,Stay ahead of me.
553,00:37:54,00:37:58,"Look, if you guys tell me what you're looking for, maybe I can help you out, um..."
554,00:37:58,00:38:00,"Look, shut up and stay still."
555,00:38:17,00:38:18,Brass?
556,00:38:18,00:38:20,How many watches do you own?
557,00:38:20,00:38:22,"Couple of sport, couple of dress."
558,00:38:22,00:38:23,Why?
559,00:38:24,00:38:25,Mr. Martin has about 20 here.
560,00:38:26,00:38:26,Twenty?
561,00:38:27,00:38:28,I'm a collector.
562,00:38:28,00:38:31,"This is a little small for your wrist, don't you think?"
563,00:38:35,00:38:39,"Several rings, a necklace, cufflinks and a gold pen."
564,00:38:40,00:38:44,"You know, these things all have one thing in common-- you can kind of slip them into your pocket."
565,00:38:44,00:38:52,"This is engraved-- ""Joan Arryington."" I wonder what the odds are that Mrs. Arryington is a client of Oden Pest Control."
566,00:38:55,00:38:58,(squawking)
567,00:39:08,00:39:11,"Hello, Bob."
568,00:39:11,00:39:12,"BOB: Hello, Bob."
569,00:39:16,00:39:18,Look what I found.
570,00:39:18,00:39:20,(Bob squawks)
571,00:39:20,00:39:22,I think we all know what happened here.
572,00:39:22,00:39:26,"After your buddies left, you were poking around Mr. Beckman's house."
573,00:39:26,00:39:27,But he surprised you.
574,00:39:30,00:39:33,(murmuring): A cage! I can't believe that manager.
575,00:39:35,00:39:38,What the hell are you doing? Just getting ready for the fume.
576,00:39:38,00:39:40,"You were rifling through my stuff... No, no, no, no, man."
577,00:39:40,00:39:43,"I was just making sure that everything, uh, was, is secure."
578,00:39:43,00:39:44,I'm going to call the police.
579,00:39:44,00:39:45,(squawks)
580,00:39:45,00:39:47,(muttering): He can't do that.
581,00:39:47,00:39:48,"No, he can't."
582,00:39:50,00:39:52,(grunts)
583,00:40:03,00:40:04,(squawks)
584,00:40:04,00:40:10,"Somehow, you managed to get the bird in the cage, seal the tent and release the gas."
585,00:40:10,00:40:11,(valve squeaks)
586,00:40:11,00:40:13,(gas whooshing)
587,00:40:17,00:40:19,(choking)
588,00:40:21,00:40:24,(grunting and choking)
589,00:40:29,00:40:31,(gas whooshing)
590,00:40:31,00:40:34,(moaning)
591,00:40:34,00:40:37,"Despite his neighbor's best efforts, he was a goner."
592,00:40:37,00:40:38,I'm not admitting to anything.
593,00:40:39,00:40:40,"You don't have to, Ted."
594,00:40:40,00:40:43,We know why the caged bird sings.
595,00:40:47,00:40:50,"So, hand me the syringe with the three percent concentration."
596,00:40:50,00:40:52,Here you go.
597,00:41:01,00:41:03,No effect.
598,00:41:03,00:41:10,STOKES: Upping the concentration of hydrogen peroxide to... seven percent.
599,00:41:24,00:41:26,Okay.
600,00:41:44,00:41:47,Concentration level 30%.
601,00:41:55,00:41:57,(popping)
602,00:41:57,00:41:59,(whooshing)
603,00:41:59,00:42:01,Lysis.
604,00:42:01,00:42:03,Concentration at 30%.
605,00:42:03,00:42:06,That's ten times the three percent specified on the menu.
606,00:42:06,00:42:09,The death was in the decimal.
607,00:42:10,00:42:12,Dr. Malaga has not committed a crime.
608,00:42:12,00:42:16,He injected a lethal batch of hydrogen peroxide into two of his patients.
609,00:42:16,00:42:23,"Even if that were true, you may have uncovered a very tragic accident, a very horrible mistake-- but certainly nothing criminal, or we'd be downtown right now."
610,00:42:23,00:42:25,No A.D.A.'s going to prosecute.
611,00:42:25,00:42:26,The procedures were elective.
612,00:42:26,00:42:32,"Catherine, you don't need me to tell you how many people die every day as a result of physician error. Well, I am not talking about other people."
613,00:42:32,00:42:34,I'm talking about Julie Stern and Renita Loakes.
614,00:42:34,00:42:36,"Yeah, both of whom looked in the mirror..."
615,00:42:36,00:42:38,and wanted to turn back time.
616,00:42:38,00:42:41,They put their trust in you because you're an M.D.
617,00:42:41,00:42:43,Your professional degree made them feel safe.
618,00:42:43,00:42:45,All procedures carry a risk.
619,00:42:45,00:42:48,Is that what you tell yourself?
620,00:42:48,00:42:52,"And when you screw up again, what happens?"
621,00:42:52,00:42:54,His malpractice premiums go up. Oh.
622,00:42:54,00:42:57,I'll be notifying the victims' families.
623,00:42:57,00:42:59,You can count on a civil suit.
624,00:43:07,00:43:08,Hi.
625,00:43:08,00:43:09,(whispers): Hi.
