0,00:00:03,00:00:08,"WOMAN: It was the '70s, it was Las Vegas, it was the time of Mickey Dunn..."
1,00:00:11,00:00:18,...the legendary organized crime figure who ran Vegas operations of extortion and racketeering by day...
2,00:00:18,00:00:19,I love America!
3,00:00:20,00:00:22,...and partied on its disco dance floors by night.
4,00:00:24,00:00:30,"Until August 1976, when federal authorities linked Dunn to the murder of a low-level mob informant."
5,00:00:30,00:00:33,It was the case prosecutors were waiting for.
6,00:00:33,00:00:36,"The arrest warrant was issued, the party was over."
7,00:00:36,00:00:39,But the legend had just begun.
8,00:00:40,00:00:46,"Mickey Dunn and his fabled gold Cadillac vanished that hot summer night, never to be seen again-- until today."
9,00:00:46,00:00:49,(speaking Spanish)
10,00:00:54,00:00:59,"So you went fishing, your line got stuck, and you pulled this up."
11,00:00:59,00:01:00,Do you know what this might be?
12,00:01:01,00:01:04,"Si, si...Everybody, they know Mickey Dunn."
13,00:01:04,00:01:07,"I'm Sally Jeffers, KRAC-TV, Lake Mead, Nevada."
14,00:01:07,00:01:09,"ANCHOMAN: Thank you, Tally."
15,00:01:09,00:01:12,We look forward to the next installment of the Mickey Dunn story.
16,00:01:12,00:01:14,"Coming through. Crime lab, coming through."
17,00:01:14,00:01:15,Thank you.
18,00:01:16,00:01:18,"MAN: All right, we're all hooked up-- let 'er rip."
19,00:01:18,00:01:19,WILLOWS: You ready for this?
20,00:01:19,00:01:23,BROWN: Ready to waste my morning on another Mickey Dunn sighting?
21,00:01:23,00:01:24,"Yeah, right."
22,00:01:24,00:01:26,The guy's been spotted more places than Elvis.
23,00:01:26,00:01:33,"BROWN: I know somewhere in hell, Mickey and his old pal Jimmy Hoffa are laughing their asses off at us poor dumb taxpayers."
24,00:01:33,00:01:34,WORKMAN: Easy now.
25,00:01:36,00:01:37,"All right, here she comes."
26,00:01:37,00:01:38,Easy... easy...
27,00:01:38,00:01:40,What do you know.
28,00:01:40,00:01:42,WILLOWS: Chainsaw.
29,00:01:42,00:01:45,That looks like him.
30,00:02:59,00:03:05,(cheering and applause)
31,00:03:05,00:03:08,Shut the machine off. You can't top that.
32,00:03:08,00:03:09,(laughing)
33,00:03:09,00:03:11,"Hey, whoa, whoa, man, man."
34,00:03:11,00:03:13,"No, no, you're not going anywhere until I buy you a round."
35,00:03:13,00:03:15,Come on.
36,00:03:15,00:03:18,(laughing): That's my music!
37,00:03:20,00:03:26,"Them that can sing it, never heard of it, and them who heard of it, they can't sing it no more."
38,00:03:26,00:03:29,"Well, there's still some of us left."
39,00:03:29,00:03:31,I thought I was the last of a dying breed.
40,00:03:31,00:03:33,Myers. Call me Michael.
41,00:03:33,00:03:35,Ken Billings. What are you drinking?
42,00:03:35,00:03:37,"What do you got? Tina, Tina."
43,00:03:48,00:03:53,I don't remember the last time I closed a joint down.
44,00:03:53,00:03:57,You know... we gotta do this again.
45,00:03:57,00:03:59,Anytime.
46,00:03:59,00:04:01,"Now, can I give you a hand?"
47,00:04:01,00:04:03,"Oh, no, no, no, no."
48,00:04:03,00:04:05,I'm fine; I'm fine. no problem.
49,00:04:11,00:04:13,"I told you, I don't need any help."
50,00:04:14,00:04:19,(singing tune) Right over there.
51,00:04:20,00:04:22,I thought I was drunk.
52,00:04:22,00:04:23,"No, back there. Back there."
53,00:04:24,00:04:26,Back there!
54,00:04:26,00:04:27,"No, no, stop..."
55,00:04:27,00:04:29,Stop! Stop!
56,00:04:29,00:04:31,Stop! What are you doing?!
57,00:04:31,00:04:34,Stop! Stop!
58,00:04:34,00:04:36,Help! Help!
59,00:04:42,00:04:43,"BRASS: All right, fine."
60,00:04:43,00:04:47,"Okay, all right. Thanks."
61,00:04:47,00:04:49,(sighs)
62,00:04:51,00:04:53,At least the driver was sober.
63,00:04:53,00:04:56,I can't say the same about the boatload of high school kids he was driving around town.
64,00:04:56,00:05:02,"Listen to some of the wonderful statements I got: ""We go, 'errr...' dude goes 'aah.' ""We go bam..."
65,00:05:02,00:05:08,"Dude goes, 'Aah!'"" The wheelchair brake attachment has been loosened."
66,00:05:08,00:05:09,"Well, maybe it broke on impact."
67,00:05:09,00:05:11,Impact was from the left side.
68,00:05:11,00:05:13,But the bolts were loosened on both sides.
69,00:05:13,00:05:21,"Well, then... that looks like we have a homicide-related road pizza."
70,00:05:21,00:05:23,GRISSOM: Yeah.
71,00:05:23,00:05:25,Who ordered it?
72,00:06:09,00:06:12,Force of impact propelled the body just over 47 feet.
73,00:06:12,00:06:14,Not a lot of spatter.
74,00:06:14,00:06:16,"External damage, mostly superficial."
75,00:06:16,00:06:18,Bet he's mashed up on the inside.
76,00:06:18,00:06:20,Probably dead before he hit the ground.
77,00:06:26,00:06:27,Oop... Wallet.
78,00:06:29,00:06:32,License... registration...
79,00:06:34,00:06:37,Kenneth Billings. Nevada resident.
80,00:06:37,00:06:40,"Date of birth, 11-9-52."
81,00:06:45,00:06:47,Photo.
82,00:06:55,00:06:57,WOMAN: Michael Myers.
83,00:06:57,00:06:59,Never seen the guy before.
84,00:06:59,00:07:00,"Sure was the life of the party, though."
85,00:07:00,00:07:01,Hmm. And the victim?
86,00:07:02,00:07:04,Kenny-- a regular. He'd come in for Karaoke night.
87,00:07:04,00:07:07,"Drink a little, go home."
88,00:07:07,00:07:08,"You'd never notice him, except for the wheelchair."
89,00:07:08,00:07:10,"Well, this is a late-night place."
90,00:07:10,00:07:11,It ever get rough in here?
91,00:07:11,00:07:12,Sometimes.
92,00:07:12,00:07:14,You think it could've been a hate crime?
93,00:07:14,00:07:17,It's a karaoke bar. I don't see a lot of hate here.
94,00:07:17,00:07:19,Me neither.
95,00:07:19,00:07:22,Mike Meyers.
96,00:07:22,00:07:24,"Here he is, Jim."
97,00:07:24,00:07:26,Knucklehead left us his autograph.
98,00:07:27,00:07:28,So what was our boy drinking?
99,00:07:28,00:07:29,The good stuff-- Well's Head Lager.
100,00:07:29,00:07:30,You sell much of that?
101,00:07:31,00:07:33,I'm lucky if I move a case a year.
102,00:07:33,00:07:34,Got trash?
103,00:07:34,00:07:37,Mm-hmm.
104,00:07:37,00:07:39,Empties should give us DNA and fingerprints.
105,00:07:39,00:07:40,Not that we really need them.
106,00:07:40,00:07:44,Mr. Meyers has already left us his photograph and signature.
107,00:07:44,00:07:45,And he sang karaoke.
108,00:07:46,00:07:46,Do you have video?
109,00:07:47,00:07:47,Tape's in the machine.
110,00:07:48,00:07:49,Perfect.
111,00:07:49,00:07:52,"Boy, you got to love it when a guy makes it easy for you."
112,00:08:03,00:08:04,Mickey Dunn's ride.
113,00:08:04,00:08:07,"Well, I guess it looked better in the '70a."
114,00:08:07,00:08:09,"Live fast, die young..."
115,00:08:09,00:08:11,Doubt he left a good-looking corpse.
116,00:08:11,00:08:13,(grunting)
117,00:08:18,00:08:20,Look at this.
118,00:08:20,00:08:25,"30 years of toxins, pesticides, heavy metal..."
119,00:08:25,00:08:27,maybe some decomp.
120,00:08:27,00:08:30,Little piece of Vegas history right here.
121,00:08:30,00:08:35,"You know, inKicks and Kisses, Lois O'Neill wrote a whole chapter about Mickey Dunn."
122,00:08:35,00:08:37,"What, that he was a thrill in the sack?"
123,00:08:37,00:08:38,"No... no, that was Tony Constantine."
124,00:08:38,00:08:44,"Apparently, Mickey wanted to go down in a barrage of bullets, like Sonny in The Godfather."
125,00:08:44,00:08:46,Quite the ego on that guy.
126,00:08:46,00:08:48,"Even in death, he was larger than life."
127,00:08:48,00:08:52,"Well, sure, but all the original mobsters were like that."
128,00:08:52,00:08:54,"Tony, Mickey Dunn, Sam Braun..."
129,00:08:54,00:08:57,My father was not a Mob guy.
130,00:08:59,00:09:01,I wasn't comparing...
131,00:09:01,00:09:03,or speaking ill of the dead.
132,00:09:07,00:09:08,Greg.
133,00:09:23,00:09:25,Now we know how Dunn-Dunn died.
134,00:09:28,00:09:32,SIDLE: How can we be sitting on this much evidence and still have nothing?
135,00:09:32,00:09:35,"Well, I can tighten up the image for you."
136,00:09:35,00:09:37,I don't think more pixels are going to solve the problem.
137,00:09:37,00:09:38,You got the face.
138,00:09:38,00:09:40,And the name.
139,00:09:40,00:09:46,"Plus photos, witnesses, DNA samples, handwriting, prints."
140,00:09:46,00:09:49,There's no record in DMV or AFIS.
141,00:09:51,00:09:53,He knew exactly where the cameras were.
142,00:09:53,00:09:55,He played right to them.
143,00:09:55,00:09:57,Obviously wasn't afraid of being identified.
144,00:09:57,00:09:59,Why not?
145,00:10:54,00:10:55,Same time next week?
146,00:10:55,00:10:57,"Sure, baby."
147,00:10:57,00:10:59,Okay.
148,00:11:01,00:11:03,"Excuse me, sir?"
149,00:11:03,00:11:05,"Please, could you help me with my bags?"
150,00:11:05,00:11:08,"I hate to bother you, but my back..."
151,00:11:08,00:11:11,Getting old ain't for sissies.
152,00:11:16,00:11:19,(choking)
153,00:11:33,00:11:35,Garroted.
154,00:11:35,00:11:39,"Wire broke the skin but, from the discoloration, I'd say suffocation killed him."
155,00:11:39,00:11:41,CURTIS: Do you know anyone who'd want to do this to him?
156,00:11:41,00:11:43,I know he wasn't into breath-play.
157,00:11:45,00:11:47,Choking on purpose.
158,00:11:47,00:11:48,More bang for your buck.
159,00:11:48,00:11:55,"After he left the room, did you hear anything-- argument, shouting-- anything like that?"
160,00:11:55,00:11:57,"No. Whatever happened, happened fast."
161,00:11:57,00:11:59,"Okay, thank you; if we have any more questions, I'll contact you."
162,00:12:04,00:12:06,I don't get it.
163,00:12:06,00:12:11,"A john walks by, the door may be open, but why walk in?"
164,00:12:11,00:12:13,Who was the room registered to?
165,00:12:13,00:12:14,"Well, the manager said an older woman."
166,00:12:14,00:12:17,"A ""Pamela Voorhees."" He's got a camera in the lobby."
167,00:12:17,00:12:19,So we'll get a face.
168,00:12:19,00:12:22,I'd love an address to go with that.
169,00:12:42,00:12:44,(unzipping suitcase)
170,00:12:49,00:12:51,Empty bags.
171,00:12:51,00:12:52,Empty closet.
172,00:12:52,00:12:54,Bags could have been a lure.
173,00:12:54,00:12:55,"Hey, guys. Busy day."
174,00:12:55,00:12:57,David...
175,00:12:57,00:12:59,"can you get us a T.O.D., please?"
176,00:13:01,00:13:02,DAVID: Oh...
177,00:13:02,00:13:06,There's something in the mouth.
178,00:13:06,00:13:07,Bizarre.
179,00:13:15,00:13:17,It's my second one today.
180,00:13:17,00:13:21,That guy got hit by a limo.
181,00:13:21,00:13:24,I guess that makes this a hit list.
182,00:14:19,00:14:22,A lead .38 round-nose.
183,00:14:22,00:14:24,I like it. It's kind of '70s.
184,00:14:24,00:14:26,You were a kid in the '70s.
185,00:14:26,00:14:30,"Yeah, but I was a Vegas kid, so I grew up on all those '70s stories."
186,00:14:30,00:14:32,"Like the ""Ghost Rider"" story."
187,00:14:32,00:14:35,Remember that one? No.
188,00:14:35,00:14:37,"You never heard of the ""Ghost Rider"" story?"
189,00:14:37,00:14:39,That has everything to do with Mickey Dunn.
190,00:14:39,00:14:41,"August 12, 1976."
191,00:14:41,00:14:53,"Officer Eddie Sanchez was the real-life motorcycle cop who radios in the last known sighting of Mickey Dunn's funky, gold Cadillac."
192,00:14:53,00:14:55,Is this on record?
193,00:14:55,00:14:57,It's stuffed away in some police file somewhere.
194,00:14:57,00:14:58,Know what happened to the cop?
195,00:14:58,00:15:00,No one does.
196,00:15:00,00:15:04,Officer Sanchez and his motorcycle disappeared that night.
197,00:15:04,00:15:05,What? In a puff of smoke?
198,00:15:05,00:15:07,A puff of smoke-- never to be heard from again.
199,00:15:07,00:15:14,Legend has it that you can still hear the Ghost Rider gunning up and down that highway.
200,00:15:14,00:15:17,My grandmother used to try to scare me into good behavior with that one. Did it work?
201,00:15:18,00:15:20,Not when I was six. No.
202,00:15:20,00:15:27,But a .38 round-nosed lead bullet was what Nevada Highway Patrol used back in the day.
203,00:15:27,00:15:31,And I don't need to tell you there was a lot of dirty cops back then.
204,00:15:31,00:15:33,There was a lot of dirty everything back then. Think about this.
205,00:15:33,00:15:38,You're a motorcycle cop. You pull over a speeding gold Cadillac.
206,00:15:38,00:15:41,Sitting in the driver's seat is Mickey Dunn.
207,00:15:41,00:15:43,Skipping town with a load of cash.
208,00:15:43,00:15:47,Bang. Put a cap in Mickey Dunn.
209,00:15:47,00:15:49,So you think this motorcycle cop killed him?
210,00:15:49,00:15:52,I think I'd like to find that police file.
211,00:15:56,00:15:58,"What, you got a better story?"
212,00:16:00,00:16:03,I was 16.
213,00:16:03,00:16:09,"Jawswas sold out, so I went looking for trouble."
214,00:16:09,00:16:12,Found Mickey Dunn.
215,00:16:26,00:16:40,"All he said was, if I met him outside at 2:00 a.m. sharp, he'd show me the time of my life."
216,00:16:40,00:16:42,No way. You and Mickey Dunn...?
217,00:16:43,00:16:46,"Well, I showed... he didn't."
218,00:16:46,00:16:51,"You were 16, hot and ready, and he stood you up?"
219,00:16:51,00:16:54,All I know is that I dodged a bullet.
220,00:16:54,00:16:56,And he didn't.
221,00:16:59,00:17:04,GRISSOM: Our killer pays in cash to avoid identification.
222,00:17:06,00:17:08,Then she signs in.
223,00:17:08,00:17:10,GRISSOM: Yeah-- giving us her name.
224,00:17:12,00:17:14,Why?
225,00:17:14,00:17:17,Gentlemen... blew up a clean copy of our hit list photo.
226,00:17:17,00:17:19,Look at that.
227,00:17:19,00:17:24,GRISSOM: Planted on two separate bodies by two separate killers.
228,00:17:24,00:17:28,"You know, Mickey Dunn practically owned Las Vegas-- these guys look like employees."
229,00:17:28,00:17:31,"Busboys, waiters, obviously at the Desert Inn."
230,00:17:31,00:17:34,Rumor has it that Mickey had a percentage of the DI.
231,00:17:34,00:17:39,It still begs the question: Why are those guys killing these guys?
232,00:17:39,00:17:44,Yeah. I'll get PD to identify the last two. See what they have to say.
233,00:17:44,00:17:46,(phone rings)
234,00:17:49,00:17:51,Grissom.
235,00:17:51,00:17:53,Yeah.
236,00:17:53,00:18:00,Okay. Brass just got a call from someone claiming that the ghost of Mickey Dunn wants to kill him.
237,00:18:15,00:18:16,(doorbell rings)
238,00:18:18,00:18:20,Johnny D'Angelo-- Las Vegas Police.
239,00:18:20,00:18:25,"Look, we tried you at work, down at the chicken joint, but no Johnny. I'm not coming out. Think I'm crazy?"
240,00:18:25,00:18:28,"Slow down. Take it easy. He killed all the others, now he's coming for me."
241,00:18:28,00:18:30,Take it easy. Can't arrest him.
242,00:18:30,00:18:32,How do you kill a man who's already dead?
243,00:18:32,00:18:38,"Why don't you make it easy on all of us and blow off this ghost business, and I.D. the person who's after you-- preferably someone living."
244,00:18:38,00:18:42,"Okay? Now, you don't even have to say a name, all right?"
245,00:18:42,00:18:44,Just point at one of these guys.
246,00:18:46,00:18:48,That's the ghost of Mickey Dunn.
247,00:18:51,00:18:53,"Okay, Johnny, I'll bite."
248,00:18:53,00:18:56,Why would a dead guy have a beef with you?
249,00:19:00,00:19:02,Back in the day... Yeah?
250,00:19:02,00:19:06,Vegas was like... out of some kids' book.
251,00:19:06,00:19:11,And Mickey Dunn was the king-- only this was real.
252,00:19:11,00:19:20,"And, in reality, the king has guys who work for guys all the way from the top to the bottom of the barrel."
253,00:19:20,00:19:25,"That was us: Kenny, Mason, me and Derek."
254,00:19:25,00:19:30,You know how they say nobody saw Mickey Dunn leave Vegas that night?
255,00:19:30,00:19:32,Yeah. It's true.
256,00:19:32,00:19:38,"'Cause we saw him, and we was nobody."
257,00:19:39,00:19:42,Mickey was acting like he owned the joint.
258,00:19:42,00:19:43,Like he owned us.
259,00:19:43,00:19:46,That's when Derek got smart.
260,00:19:48,00:19:52,Derek explained that we hadn't been paid in months.
261,00:19:59,00:20:01,We were young.
262,00:20:01,00:20:03,We were stupid.
263,00:20:05,00:20:06,But Derek...
264,00:20:07,00:20:08,...he was insane.
265,00:20:11,00:20:13,"What do you got there, nitroglycerine?"
266,00:20:13,00:20:14,Bum ticker.
267,00:20:14,00:20:17,"You know you just confessed to armed robbery, right?"
268,00:20:17,00:20:19,Least of my worries.
269,00:20:20,00:20:27,"Now, either you get out there and you arrest the ghost of Mickey Dunn or you get the hell off my property."
270,00:20:27,00:20:30,"We're the cops, not the Ghostbusters."
271,00:20:35,00:20:38,(camera shutter clicking)
272,00:20:42,00:20:44,(shutter clicking)
273,00:20:46,00:20:47,Excuse me?
274,00:20:47,00:20:49,Hello.
275,00:20:49,00:20:50,Who are you?
276,00:20:51,00:20:54,"I work here, in the, uh, lab. No, I don't think so."
277,00:20:54,00:20:58,"I know everybody that works here, and I don't know you."
278,00:20:58,00:21:00,I'm new.
279,00:21:00,00:21:02,You're lying.
280,00:21:02,00:21:04,Give me that camera.
281,00:21:06,00:21:08,Now.
282,00:21:08,00:21:09,"All right, all right."
283,00:21:14,00:21:16,(grunts)
284,00:21:16,00:21:17,(groans)
285,00:21:18,00:21:20,Security!

287,00:21:22,00:21:25,Hm.
288,00:21:31,00:21:32,(electronic squeak)
289,00:21:37,00:21:38,Book that moron.
290,00:21:38,00:21:40,Keep the camera.
291,00:21:56,00:21:57,(knocking)
292,00:21:59,00:22:01,Iris Paul?
293,00:22:01,00:22:04,"Yes. Officer Mitchell, Las Vegas Police Department."
294,00:22:04,00:22:05,Are you Derek's mother?
295,00:22:05,00:22:07,"Yes, I am."
296,00:22:07,00:22:13,"(door closes inside) But I haven't seen Derek in-in months, uh, not since he got out of prison, mm-mm."
297,00:22:14,00:22:16,He might be in Florida.
298,00:22:16,00:22:17,Florida. Yeah.
299,00:22:17,00:22:19,He loves it down there.
300,00:22:19,00:22:21,Can you give me a description of Derek?
301,00:22:21,00:22:30,"Sure, sure. Uh, he's very tall, very, very lean, he has very long, dark hair that he won't cut, no matter how many times... Kind of like that?"
302,00:22:30,00:22:32,(officers shouting in distance)
303,00:22:32,00:22:35,(grunting)
304,00:22:37,00:22:40,CURTIS: So why'd you run?
305,00:22:40,00:22:42,I don't like cops.
306,00:22:42,00:22:44,"We hear you don't like criminals, either."
307,00:22:45,00:22:46,Is that right?
308,00:22:46,00:22:48,We know you worked for Mickey Dunn.
309,00:22:48,00:22:52,"We know you chased him, you ran him off the road, you stuck a gun in his face."
310,00:22:52,00:22:55,That's armed robbery.
311,00:22:55,00:22:57,If it happened.
312,00:22:58,00:23:00,Johnny D'Angelo said it did.
313,00:23:00,00:23:02,How is old scaredy-cat?
314,00:23:02,00:23:04,Credible.
315,00:23:04,00:23:06,There were a lot of rumors going around.
316,00:23:06,00:23:08,"Mickey owned this, he owned that."
317,00:23:08,00:23:10,He owned a piece of the D.I.
318,00:23:10,00:23:12,We just happened to work there.
319,00:23:13,00:23:14,A lot of us guys did.
320,00:23:14,00:23:17,"See, I'm thinking that's not the full story."
321,00:23:17,00:23:21,You're young; you don't know.
322,00:23:21,00:23:24,"The memories, you get up there, they..."
323,00:23:24,00:23:26,they start getting tricky.
324,00:23:26,00:23:29,"Well, why don't you tell me what you do remember."
325,00:23:30,00:23:34,"We took a little joyride, looking for Mickey Dunn."
326,00:23:34,00:23:41,"But we never found him-- because someone else found him first, and who that was, I don't know."
327,00:23:41,00:23:48,"Because, by the time we got there, whoever had killed Mickey Dunn was already gone."
328,00:23:48,00:23:51,Whoosh. Like a ghost.
329,00:23:51,00:23:53,I don't believe in ghosts.
330,00:23:53,00:23:58,"But we got one scared guy, we got two dead guys, and we got you, Derek."
331,00:24:00,00:24:03,How do you feel about your buddies getting bumped off?
332,00:24:03,00:24:06,I'm all torn up inside.
333,00:24:09,00:24:11,You ever seen them?
334,00:24:11,00:24:13,DEREK: Never.
335,00:24:13,00:24:17,But... they look like suspects.
336,00:24:17,00:24:19,And I think you're fishing.
337,00:24:19,00:24:23,And you got no legal right to hold me.
338,00:24:24,00:24:27,If you can't hold me...
339,00:24:27,00:24:30,you got to let me go.

342,00:24:52,00:24:54,Johnny?
343,00:24:54,00:24:55,Johnny D'Angelo?

345,00:25:07,00:25:09,"(doorjamb cracks, alarm blares)"
346,00:25:10,00:25:13,Johnny D'Angelo! Las Vegas PD!
347,00:25:30,00:25:32,(sighs)
348,00:25:37,00:25:38,"Yeah, go for Brass."
349,00:25:39,00:25:40,CURTIS: Scene is Code 4.
350,00:25:40,00:25:42,Johnny D'Angelo is not at his house.
351,00:25:42,00:25:45,"BRASS: Okay, got it. Thank you."

366,00:26:59,00:27:00,Tetracycline.
367,00:27:06,00:27:09,You want to help me with a little experiment?
368,00:27:09,00:27:11,Sure.
369,00:27:15,00:27:18,Grab that evidence bag?
370,00:27:21,00:27:23,"Okay, let me see that."
371,00:27:23,00:27:25,Take this.
372,00:27:29,00:27:33,No go. Okay.
373,00:27:38,00:27:41,Looks like a match to me.
374,00:27:41,00:27:42,This is your experiment?
375,00:27:43,00:27:44,"Actually, it is."
376,00:27:44,00:27:45,Thanks.
377,00:27:45,00:27:52,"GRISSOM: The victims-- Ken Billings, Mason Carter, Derek Paul and Johnny D'Angelo-- all murdered in the last 24 hours."
378,00:27:52,00:27:55,"Four victims, three killers, no connection between them."
379,00:27:55,00:28:00,Johnny D'Angelo's on both lists. BROWN: Could be he hired the others.
380,00:28:00,00:28:01,Could be. We don't knowwherethey are.
381,00:28:02,00:28:09,"We don't knowwhothey are. Let's stick to what we do know-- all the victims worked for Mickey Dunn, who's been dead for 30 years."
382,00:28:09,00:28:10,"Well, check this out."
383,00:28:10,00:28:14,"I've been digging through the police files all morning, and guess who I found."
384,00:28:14,00:28:17,Officer Eddie Sanchez.
385,00:28:17,00:28:22,"The ""Ghost Rider."" Now, assuming he's alive, the officer would be 55 today."
386,00:28:22,00:28:25,And he has family down in Mexico.
387,00:28:25,00:28:29,"So you're thinking bike cop shoots Mickey Dunn, dumps the car and takes the money?"
388,00:28:29,00:28:34,"SANDERS: And with the exchange rate, lives like a king, south of the border, for the last 30 years."
389,00:28:34,00:28:36,Fast-forward-- Mickey Dunn's car gets discovered.
390,00:28:36,00:28:41,SIDLE: By a Mexican fisherman who would be just about the same age as the bike cop.
391,00:28:41,00:28:43,Only the discovery was bogus.
392,00:28:43,00:28:46,Turns out the hood ornament pulled from Lake Mead is a fake.
393,00:28:46,00:28:50,"So... the fisherman was what, pulling off a hoax?"
394,00:28:50,00:28:57,"GRISSOM: That or fraud-- he either planted that derringer at the crime scene, or maybe someone paid him to."
395,00:28:57,00:29:00,"BROWN: Either way, whoever did it knew that this car was down there."
396,00:29:00,00:29:02,SANDERS: And was missing the original hood ornament.
397,00:29:02,00:29:04,SIDLE: Who could know that?
398,00:29:04,00:29:07,Someone who was there the night it went down.
399,00:29:07,00:29:10,SANDERS: The motorcycle cop's looking better every minute.
400,00:29:11,00:29:14,"Hey, don't rule out the ghost of Mickey Dunn."
401,00:29:14,00:29:21,"Doc told me to tell you: your last vic, the one all pretzeled up in the oven, lividity's fixed: dead two days."
402,00:29:22,00:29:24,Before the Cadillac was found. Yeah.
403,00:29:25,00:29:29,"Ah, and I got trace analysis on the sample Phillips collected on Chicken Johnny."
404,00:29:30,00:29:32,And? Alginate and plaster of Paris.
405,00:29:32,00:29:36,Combination used to make dental impressions.
406,00:29:36,00:29:39,And you don't even seem to be the teeniest bit surprised.

412,00:30:47,00:30:49,who's the hotel killer now?
413,00:30:49,00:30:51,Who's Pamela Voorhees?

415,00:30:54,00:30:56,Jason's the sequel.
416,00:30:56,00:31:01,"Pamela, the mother, was the killer in the original-- that's the question that tripped up Drew Barrymore inScream."
417,00:31:02,00:31:03,"Yeah, and look what happened to her."

423,00:31:28,00:31:35,"The thing that really gets me is I talked to this killer dressed as Johnny D'Angelo, close enough to smell his breath and still he walks."
424,00:31:35,00:31:37,All the evidence says he was wearing state-of-the-art prosthetics.
425,00:31:37,00:31:40,I want to see him in an orange jumpsuit and cuffs.
426,00:31:40,00:31:42,He's got the real Johnny's wallet.
427,00:31:42,00:31:46,"Well, if he's got his driver's license, he could be using it to try and escape."
428,00:31:46,00:31:49,He said the vic's car is parked in the parking lot.
429,00:31:49,00:31:50,He doesn't need his car.
430,00:31:50,00:31:51,He's got his face.

455,00:33:43,00:33:47,He also had a skin condition commonly known as acne which he treated with tetracycline.

463,00:34:15,00:34:17,You missed a big spot.
464,00:34:17,00:34:20,I shot a lot of guys point-blank.
465,00:34:20,00:34:29,But this nosy piece of garbage bike cop that you two are so teared-up about...
466,00:34:29,00:34:35,I shot him from 40 feet away with a soaking-wet revolver.
467,00:34:35,00:34:38,It was one hell of a shot.
468,00:34:46,00:34:50,The poor dumb bastard didn't know what hit him.
469,00:34:50,00:34:51,He thought he'd been trained.
470,00:34:51,00:34:53,They don't prepare you for what I got.
471,00:34:58,00:35:00,SANCHEZ: Stop!
472,00:35:00,00:35:01,Stop or I'll shoot!
473,00:35:04,00:35:05,I said stop!
474,00:35:09,00:35:17,You found the skull had no teeth because I bashed 'em in with the barrel of my gun.
475,00:35:17,00:35:24,And all the forensics in the world ain't gonna show you that when I smashed his face in...
476,00:35:26,00:35:28,I liked it.
477,00:35:30,00:35:33,"You're under arrest, Mickey, for murder."
478,00:35:34,00:35:38,Thank God you blew me off when I didn't know better.
479,00:35:39,00:35:41,Sam Braun's daughter.
480,00:35:45,00:35:47,You think that I would ever forget a face?
481,00:35:47,00:35:49,That face?
482,00:35:54,00:35:57,"Meet me outside, 2:00 a.m. sharp."
483,00:36:01,00:36:11,Ask yourself what force on earth that kept me from your soft teenage graces.
484,00:36:11,00:36:18,Only one: Daddy.
485,00:36:18,00:36:19,Sam Braun stopped you?
486,00:36:19,00:36:26,"Sam always said if I ever touched you, he'd tear me apart."
487,00:36:26,00:36:28,That took a big pair to say that to me.
488,00:36:28,00:36:32,He said that you were family.
489,00:36:32,00:36:33,"Still, now he's gone."
490,00:36:34,00:36:36,We're here.
491,00:36:36,00:36:38,We could always give it a go.
492,00:36:38,00:36:41,You're not going anywhere.
493,00:36:41,00:36:43,(gasping)
494,00:36:45,00:36:46,(grunting)
495,00:36:48,00:36:49,He's having a heart attack.
496,00:36:49,00:36:52,Call a paramedic.
497,00:36:52,00:36:55,Bum ticker... right on time.
498,00:36:55,00:36:56,I'm dying.
499,00:36:56,00:36:59,"Okay, take it easy, buddy."
500,00:36:59,00:37:00,Take it easy.
501,00:37:12,00:37:15,WILLOWS: I'll give you a hint: you're not in Heaven.
502,00:37:17,00:37:20,How long you been living with a bullet in your chest?
503,00:37:20,00:37:22,Who told you?
504,00:37:22,00:37:25,Why God invented X rays.
505,00:37:25,00:37:31,"You'd like to take it out, have a closer look."
506,00:37:31,00:37:35,"Ah, but you can't do that, not without killing me."
507,00:37:35,00:37:38,I'm guessing it's a .38...
508,00:37:41,00:37:47,"...which matches the .38 that we took from the body of Derek Paul, which also matches the one that killed Eddie Sanchez."
509,00:37:54,00:37:57,"You like horror movies, Mickey?"
510,00:37:57,00:38:00,You know... I love 'em.
511,00:38:00,00:38:01,I got one for you.
512,00:38:02,00:38:04,Does it got a monster in it?
513,00:38:04,00:38:06,(chuckles) Yeah.
514,00:38:06,00:38:08,I bet you heard it.
515,00:38:08,00:38:11,It's strictly B-list stuff.
516,00:38:11,00:38:14,"No-name cast, summer release."
517,00:38:14,00:38:18,Four Vegas punks run a monster off the road.
518,00:38:18,00:38:21,"They shoot him, they rob him, they leave him for dead."
519,00:38:26,00:38:30,But everybody knows that shooting the monster and killing him are never the same.
520,00:38:44,00:38:49,A young honest cop arrives and with him comes opportunity.
521,00:38:53,00:38:56,"The monster changes his name, his face..."
522,00:39:01,00:39:04,...passes for human.
523,00:39:04,00:39:08,Rides off into the night.
524,00:39:10,00:39:14,And the legend is born.
525,00:39:14,00:39:15,The end.
526,00:39:15,00:39:19,"Mickey, you know that real horror stories never end."
527,00:39:19,00:39:23,"Oh, this one does."
528,00:39:23,00:39:25,(laughs)
529,00:39:25,00:39:35,"It's been huge fun coming back, trying new faces, leading you all around town by the nostrils."
530,00:39:35,00:39:38,Setting up the big discovery.
531,00:39:38,00:39:40,"Everybody, he know Mickey Dunn."
532,00:39:41,00:39:46,"I'm Sally Jeffers, KRAC-TV, Lake Mead, Nevada."
533,00:39:46,00:39:49,MICKEY: Going after Kenneth...
534,00:39:49,00:39:51,I'm Mickey Dunn.
535,00:39:52,00:39:55,(wheelchair crashes as tires squeal)
536,00:39:58,00:40:00,...taking out Mason...
537,00:40:04,00:40:11,"...and the best part of all, the look on poor Johnny's face."
538,00:40:11,00:40:16,"Not the most handsome guy in the world, but a face worth wearing."
539,00:40:16,00:40:23,And the hardest part-- learning Spanish.
540,00:40:23,00:40:26,(chuckles)
541,00:40:26,00:40:27,Good times.
542,00:40:27,00:40:30,Why now?
543,00:40:30,00:40:35,Because that tiny piece of metal that Derek shot in my chest has finally moved.
544,00:40:35,00:40:41,"Doctors gave me a week, maybe two, to live."
545,00:40:41,00:40:45,"Figured I'd go out with a bang, never see the inside of a cell."
546,00:40:45,00:40:54,It's really funny how one little bullet can make things suddenly seem so clear.
547,00:40:59,00:41:01,You mean this bullet?
548,00:41:03,00:41:10,Mob doctors become Mob doctors because they sucked in the first place.
549,00:41:10,00:41:15,But we got a licensed surgeon that fixed you up good.
550,00:41:15,00:41:19,"Cheer up, Mickey, you're gonna live another 20... 30 years."
551,00:41:20,00:41:24,And you'll be spending every day in the federal penitentiary.
552,00:41:24,00:41:28,But only until you die.
553,00:41:31,00:41:34,"Well, I'll still go out a legend."
554,00:41:34,00:41:36,You haven't changed that.
555,00:41:36,00:41:39,"Oh, you've been out of the game awhile."
556,00:41:39,00:41:43,The homies they have in the pen these days never heard of you.
557,00:41:43,00:41:46,That's impossible.
558,00:41:46,00:41:50,"No, Mickey, that's life."
