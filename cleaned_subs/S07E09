0	00:00:03	00:00:08	It was the '70s, it was Las Vegas, it was the time of Mickey Dunn...
1	00:00:11	00:00:18	...the legendary organized crime figure who ran Vegas operations of extortion and racketeering by day...
2	00:00:18	00:00:19	I love America!
3	00:00:20	00:00:22	...and partied on its disco dance floors by night.
4	00:00:24	00:00:30	Until August 1976, when federal authorities linked Dunn to the murder of a low-level mob informant.
5	00:00:30	00:00:33	It was the case prosecutors were waiting for.
6	00:00:33	00:00:36	The arrest warrant was issued, the party was over.
7	00:00:36	00:00:39	But the legend had just begun.
8	00:00:40	00:00:46	Mickey Dunn and his fabled gold Cadillac vanished that hot summer night, never to be seen again-- until today.
9	00:00:54	00:00:59	So you went fishing, your line got stuck, and you pulled this up.
10	00:00:59	00:01:00	Do you know what this might be?
11	00:01:01	00:01:04	Si, si... Everybody, they know Mickey Dunn.
12	00:01:04	00:01:07	I'm Sally Jeffers, KRAC-TV, Lake Mead, Nevada.
13	00:01:07	00:01:09	Thank you, Tally.
14	00:01:09	00:01:12	We look forward to the next installment of the Mickey Dunn story.
15	00:01:12	00:01:14	Coming through. Crime lab, coming through.
16	00:01:14	00:01:15	Thank you.
17	00:01:16	00:01:18	All right, we're all hooked up-- let 'er rip.
18	00:01:18	00:01:19	You ready for this?
19	00:01:19	00:01:23	Ready to waste my morning on another Mickey Dunn sighting?
20	00:01:23	00:01:24	Yeah, right.
21	00:01:24	00:01:26	The guy's been spotted more places than Elvis.
22	00:01:26	00:01:33	I know somewhere in hell, Mickey and his old pal Jimmy Hoffa are laughing their asses off at us poor dumb taxpayers.
23	00:01:33	00:01:34	Easy now.
24	00:01:36	00:01:37	All right, here she comes.
25	00:01:37	00:01:38	Easy... easy...
26	00:01:38	00:01:40	What do you know.
27	00:01:40	00:01:42	Chainsaw.
28	00:01:42	00:01:45	That looks like him.
29	00:03:05	00:03:08	Shut the machine off. You can't top that.
30	00:03:09	00:03:11	Hey, whoa, whoa, man, man.
31	00:03:11	00:03:13	No, no, you're not going anywhere until I buy you a round.
32	00:03:13	00:03:15	Come on.
33	00:03:15	00:03:18	That's my music!
34	00:03:20	00:03:26	Them that can sing it, never heard of it, and them who heard of it, they can't sing it no more.
35	00:03:26	00:03:29	Well, there's still some of us left.
36	00:03:29	00:03:31	I thought I was the last of a dying breed.
37	00:03:31	00:03:33	Myers. Call me Michael.
38	00:03:33	00:03:35	Ken Billings. What are you drinking?
39	00:03:35	00:03:37	What do you got? Tina, Tina.
40	00:03:48	00:03:53	I don't remember the last time I closed a joint down.
41	00:03:53	00:03:57	You know... we gotta do this again.
42	00:03:57	00:03:59	Anytime.
43	00:03:59	00:04:01	Now, can I give you a hand?
44	00:04:01	00:04:03	Oh, no, no, no, no.
45	00:04:03	00:04:05	I'm fine; I'm fine. no problem.
46	00:04:11	00:04:13	I told you, I don't need any help.
47	00:04:14	00:04:19	(singing tune) Right over there.
48	00:04:20	00:04:22	I thought I was drunk.
49	00:04:22	00:04:23	No, back there. Back there.
50	00:04:24	00:04:26	Back there!
51	00:04:26	00:04:27	No, no, stop...
52	00:04:27	00:04:29	Stop! Stop!
53	00:04:29	00:04:31	Stop! What are you doing?!
54	00:04:31	00:04:34	Stop! Stop!
55	00:04:34	00:04:36	Help! Help!
56	00:04:42	00:04:43	All right, fine.
57	00:04:43	00:04:47	Okay, all right. Thanks.
58	00:04:51	00:04:53	At least the driver was sober.
59	00:04:53	00:04:56	I can't say the same about the boatload of high school kids he was driving around town.
60	00:04:58	00:05:02	We go, 'errr...' dude goes 'aah.' We go bam...
61	00:05:02	00:05:08	Dude goes, 'Aah!' The wheelchair brake attachment has been loosened.
62	00:05:08	00:05:09	Well, maybe it broke on impact.
63	00:05:09	00:05:11	Impact was from the left side.
64	00:05:11	00:05:13	But the bolts were loosened on both sides.
65	00:05:13	00:05:21	Well, then... that looks like we have a homicide-related road pizza.
66	00:05:21	00:05:23	Yeah.
67	00:05:23	00:05:25	Who ordered it?
68	00:06:09	00:06:12	Force of impact propelled the body just over 47 feet.
69	00:06:12	00:06:14	Not a lot of spatter.
70	00:06:14	00:06:16	External damage, mostly superficial.
71	00:06:16	00:06:18	Bet he's mashed up on the inside.
72	00:06:18	00:06:20	Probably dead before he hit the ground.
73	00:06:26	00:06:27	Oop... Wallet.
74	00:06:29	00:06:32	License... registration...
75	00:06:34	00:06:37	Kenneth Billings. Nevada resident.
76	00:06:37	00:06:40	Date of birth, 11-9-52.
77	00:06:45	00:06:47	Photo.
78	00:06:55	00:06:57	Michael Myers.
79	00:06:57	00:06:59	Never seen the guy before.
80	00:06:59	00:07:00	Sure was the life of the party, though.
81	00:07:00	00:07:01	Hmm. And the victim?
82	00:07:02	00:07:04	Kenny-- a regular. He'd come in for Karaoke night.
83	00:07:04	00:07:07	Drink a little, go home.
84	00:07:07	00:07:08	You'd never notice him, except for the wheelchair.
85	00:07:08	00:07:10	Well, this is a late-night place.
86	00:07:10	00:07:11	It ever get rough in here?
87	00:07:11	00:07:12	Sometimes.
88	00:07:12	00:07:14	You think it could've been a hate crime?
89	00:07:14	00:07:17	It's a karaoke bar. I don't see a lot of hate here.
90	00:07:17	00:07:19	Me neither.
91	00:07:19	00:07:22	Mike Meyers.
92	00:07:22	00:07:24	Here he is, Jim.
93	00:07:24	00:07:26	Knucklehead left us his autograph.
94	00:07:27	00:07:28	So what was our boy drinking?
95	00:07:28	00:07:29	The good stuff-- Well's Head Lager.
96	00:07:29	00:07:30	You sell much of that?
97	00:07:31	00:07:33	I'm lucky if I move a case a year.
98	00:07:33	00:07:34	Got trash?
99	00:07:34	00:07:37	Mm-hmm.
100	00:07:37	00:07:39	Empties should give us DNA and fingerprints.
101	00:07:39	00:07:40	Not that we really need them.
102	00:07:40	00:07:44	Mr. Meyers has already left us his photograph and signature.
103	00:07:44	00:07:45	And he sang karaoke.
104	00:07:46	00:07:46	Do you have video?
105	00:07:47	00:07:47	Tape's in the machine.
106	00:07:48	00:07:49	Perfect.
107	00:07:49	00:07:52	Boy, you got to love it when a guy makes it easy for you.
108	00:08:03	00:08:04	Mickey Dunn's ride.
109	00:08:04	00:08:07	Well, I guess it looked better in the '70a.
110	00:08:07	00:08:09	Live fast, die young...
111	00:08:09	00:08:11	Doubt he left a good-looking corpse.
112	00:08:18	00:08:20	Look at this.
113	00:08:20	00:08:25	30 years of toxins, pesticides, heavy metal...
114	00:08:25	00:08:27	maybe some decomp.
115	00:08:27	00:08:30	Little piece of Vegas history right here.
116	00:08:30	00:08:35	You know, in Kicks and Kisses, Lois O'Neill wrote a whole chapter about Mickey Dunn.
117	00:08:35	00:08:37	What, that he was a thrill in the sack?
118	00:08:37	00:08:38	No... no, that was Tony Constantine.
119	00:08:38	00:08:44	Apparently, Mickey wanted to go down in a barrage of bullets, like Sonny in The Godfather.
120	00:08:44	00:08:46	Quite the ego on that guy.
121	00:08:46	00:08:48	Even in death, he was larger than life.
122	00:08:48	00:08:52	Well, sure, but all the original mobsters were like that.
123	00:08:52	00:08:54	Tony, Mickey Dunn, Sam Braun...
124	00:08:54	00:08:57	My father was not a Mob guy.
125	00:08:59	00:09:01	I wasn't comparing...
126	00:09:01	00:09:03	or speaking ill of the dead.
127	00:09:07	00:09:08	Greg.
128	00:09:23	00:09:25	Now we know how Dunn-Dunn died.
129	00:09:28	00:09:32	How can we be sitting on this much evidence and still have nothing?
130	00:09:32	00:09:35	Well, I can tighten up the image for you.
131	00:09:35	00:09:37	I don't think more pixels are going to solve the problem.
132	00:09:37	00:09:38	You got the face.
133	00:09:38	00:09:40	And the name.
134	00:09:40	00:09:46	Plus photos, witnesses, DNA samples, handwriting, prints.
135	00:09:46	00:09:49	There's no record in DMV or AFIS.
136	00:09:51	00:09:53	He knew exactly where the cameras were.
137	00:09:53	00:09:55	He played right to them.
138	00:09:55	00:09:57	Obviously wasn't afraid of being identified.
139	00:09:57	00:09:59	Why not?
140	00:10:54	00:10:55	Same time next week?
141	00:10:55	00:10:57	Sure, baby.
142	00:10:57	00:10:59	Okay.
143	00:11:01	00:11:03	Excuse me, sir?
144	00:11:03	00:11:05	Please, could you help me with my bags?
145	00:11:05	00:11:08	I hate to bother you, but my back...
146	00:11:08	00:11:11	Getting old ain't for sissies.
147	00:11:33	00:11:35	Garroted.
148	00:11:35	00:11:39	Wire broke the skin but, from the discoloration, I'd say suffocation killed him.
149	00:11:39	00:11:41	Do you know anyone who'd want to do this to him?
150	00:11:41	00:11:43	I know he wasn't into breath-play.
151	00:11:45	00:11:47	Choking on purpose.
152	00:11:47	00:11:48	More bang for your buck.
153	00:11:48	00:11:55	After he left the room, did you hear anything-- argument, shouting-- anything like that?
154	00:11:55	00:11:57	No. Whatever happened, happened fast.
155	00:11:57	00:11:59	Okay, thank you; if we have any more questions, I'll contact you.
156	00:12:04	00:12:06	I don't get it.
157	00:12:06	00:12:11	A john walks by, the door may be open, but why walk in?
158	00:12:11	00:12:13	Who was the room registered to?
159	00:12:13	00:12:14	Well, the manager said an older woman.
160	00:12:14	00:12:16	A Pamela Voorhees.
161	00:12:16	00:12:17	He's got a camera in the lobby.
162	00:12:17	00:12:19	So we'll get a face.
163	00:12:19	00:12:22	I'd love an address to go with that.
164	00:12:49	00:12:51	Empty bags.
165	00:12:51	00:12:52	Empty closet.
166	00:12:52	00:12:54	Bags could have been a lure.
167	00:12:54	00:12:55	Hey, guys. Busy day.
168	00:12:55	00:12:57	David...
169	00:12:57	00:12:59	can you get us a T.O.D., please?
170	00:13:01	00:13:02	Oh...
171	00:13:02	00:13:06	There's something in the mouth.
172	00:13:06	00:13:07	Bizarre.
173	00:13:15	00:13:17	It's my second one today.
174	00:13:17	00:13:21	That guy got hit by a limo.
175	00:13:21	00:13:24	I guess that makes this a hit list.
176	00:14:19	00:14:22	A lead .38 round-nose.
177	00:14:22	00:14:24	I like it. It's kind of '70s.
178	00:14:24	00:14:26	You were a kid in the '70s.
179	00:14:26	00:14:30	Yeah, but I was a Vegas kid, so I grew up on all those '70s stories.
180	00:14:30	00:14:32	Like the Ghost Rider story.
181	00:14:32	00:14:35	Remember that one? No.
182	00:14:35	00:14:37	You never heard of the Ghost Rider story?
183	00:14:37	00:14:39	That has everything to do with Mickey Dunn.
184	00:14:39	00:14:41	August 12, 1976.
185	00:14:41	00:14:53	Officer Eddie Sanchez was the real-life motorcycle cop who radios in the last known sighting of Mickey Dunn's funky, gold Cadillac.
186	00:14:53	00:14:55	Is this on record?
187	00:14:55	00:14:57	It's stuffed away in some police file somewhere.
188	00:14:57	00:14:58	Know what happened to the cop?
189	00:14:58	00:15:00	No one does.
190	00:15:00	00:15:04	Officer Sanchez and his motorcycle disappeared that night.
191	00:15:04	00:15:05	What? In a puff of smoke?
192	00:15:05	00:15:07	A puff of smoke-- never to be heard from again.
193	00:15:07	00:15:14	Legend has it that you can still hear the Ghost Rider gunning up and down that highway.
194	00:15:14	00:15:17	My grandmother used to try to scare me into good behavior with that one. Did it work?
195	00:15:18	00:15:20	Not when I was six. No.
196	00:15:20	00:15:27	But a .38 round-nosed lead bullet was what Nevada Highway Patrol used back in the day.
197	00:15:27	00:15:31	And I don't need to tell you there was a lot of dirty cops back then.
198	00:15:31	00:15:33	There was a lot of dirty everything back then. Think about this.
199	00:15:33	00:15:38	You're a motorcycle cop. You pull over a speeding gold Cadillac.
200	00:15:38	00:15:41	Sitting in the driver's seat is Mickey Dunn.
201	00:15:41	00:15:43	Skipping town with a load of cash.
202	00:15:43	00:15:47	Bang. Put a cap in Mickey Dunn.
203	00:15:47	00:15:49	So you think this motorcycle cop killed him?
204	00:15:49	00:15:52	I think I'd like to find that police file.
205	00:15:56	00:15:58	What, you got a better story?
206	00:16:00	00:16:03	I was 16.
207	00:16:03	00:16:09	Jaws was sold out, so I went looking for trouble.
208	00:16:09	00:16:12	Found Mickey Dunn.
209	00:16:26	00:16:40	All he said was, 00 a.m. sharp, he'd show me the time of my life.
210	00:16:40	00:16:42	No way. You and Mickey Dunn...?
211	00:16:43	00:16:46	Well, I showed... he didn't.
212	00:16:46	00:16:51	You were 16, hot and ready, and he stood you up?
213	00:16:51	00:16:54	All I know is that I dodged a bullet.
214	00:16:54	00:16:56	And he didn't.
215	00:16:59	00:17:04	Our killer pays in cash to avoid identification.
216	00:17:06	00:17:08	Then she signs in.
217	00:17:08	00:17:10	Yeah-- giving us her name.
218	00:17:12	00:17:14	Why?
219	00:17:14	00:17:17	Gentlemen... blew up a clean copy of our hit list photo.
220	00:17:17	00:17:19	Look at that.
221	00:17:19	00:17:24	Planted on two separate bodies by two separate killers.
222	00:17:24	00:17:28	You know, Mickey Dunn practically owned Las Vegas-- these guys look like employees.
223	00:17:28	00:17:31	Busboys, waiters, obviously at the Desert Inn.
224	00:17:31	00:17:34	Rumor has it that Mickey had a percentage of the DI.
225	00:17:37	00:17:39	Why are those guys killing these guys?
226	00:17:39	00:17:44	Yeah. I'll get PD to identify the last two. See what they have to say.
227	00:17:49	00:17:51	Grissom.
228	00:17:51	00:17:53	Yeah.
229	00:17:53	00:18:00	Okay. Brass just got a call from someone claiming that the ghost of Mickey Dunn wants to kill him.
230	00:18:18	00:18:20	Johnny D'Angelo-- Las Vegas Police.
231	00:18:20	00:18:25	Look, we tried you at work, down at the chicken joint, but no Johnny. I'm not coming out. Think I'm crazy?
232	00:18:25	00:18:28	Slow down. Take it easy. He killed all the others, now he's coming for me.
233	00:18:28	00:18:30	Take it easy. Can't arrest him.
234	00:18:30	00:18:32	How do you kill a man who's already dead?
235	00:18:32	00:18:38	Why don't you make it easy on all of us and blow off this ghost business, and I.D. the person who's after you-- preferably someone living.
236	00:18:38	00:18:42	Okay? Now, you don't even have to say a name, all right?
237	00:18:42	00:18:44	Just point at one of these guys.
238	00:18:46	00:18:48	That's the ghost of Mickey Dunn.
239	00:18:51	00:18:53	Okay, Johnny, I'll bite.
240	00:18:53	00:18:56	Why would a dead guy have a beef with you?
241	00:19:00	00:19:02	Back in the day... Yeah?
242	00:19:02	00:19:06	Vegas was like... out of some kids' book.
243	00:19:06	00:19:11	And Mickey Dunn was the king-- only this was real.
244	00:19:11	00:19:20	And, in reality, the king has guys who work for guys all the way from the top to the bottom of the barrel.
245	00:19:21	00:19:25	Kenny, Mason, me and Derek.
246	00:19:25	00:19:30	You know how they say nobody saw Mickey Dunn leave Vegas that night?
247	00:19:30	00:19:32	Yeah. It's true.
248	00:19:32	00:19:38	'Cause we saw him, and we was nobody.
249	00:19:39	00:19:42	Mickey was acting like he owned the joint.
250	00:19:42	00:19:43	Like he owned us.
251	00:19:43	00:19:46	That's when Derek got smart.
252	00:19:48	00:19:52	Derek explained that we hadn't been paid in months.
253	00:19:59	00:20:01	We were young.
254	00:20:01	00:20:03	We were stupid.
255	00:20:05	00:20:06	But Derek...
256	00:20:07	00:20:08	...he was insane.
257	00:20:11	00:20:13	What do you got there, nitroglycerine?
258	00:20:13	00:20:14	Bum ticker.
259	00:20:14	00:20:17	You know you just confessed to armed robbery, right?
260	00:20:17	00:20:19	Least of my worries.
261	00:20:20	00:20:27	Now, either you get out there and you arrest the ghost of Mickey Dunn or you get the hell off my property.
262	00:20:27	00:20:30	We're the cops, not the Ghostbusters.
263	00:20:46	00:20:47	Excuse me?
264	00:20:47	00:20:49	Hello.
265	00:20:49	00:20:50	Who are you?
266	00:20:51	00:20:54	I work here, in the, uh, lab. No, I don't think so.
267	00:20:54	00:20:58	I know everybody that works here, and I don't know you.
268	00:20:58	00:21:00	I'm new.
269	00:21:00	00:21:02	You're lying.
270	00:21:02	00:21:04	Give me that camera.
271	00:21:06	00:21:08	Now.
272	00:21:08	00:21:09	All right, all right.
273	00:21:18	00:21:20	Security!
274	00:21:20	00:21:22	Damn paparazzi.
275	00:21:22	00:21:25	Hm.
276	00:21:37	00:21:38	Book that moron.
277	00:21:38	00:21:40	Keep the camera.
278	00:21:59	00:22:01	Iris Paul?
279	00:22:01	00:22:04	Yes. Officer Mitchell, Las Vegas Police Department.
280	00:22:04	00:22:05	Are you Derek's mother?
281	00:22:05	00:22:07	Yes, I am.
282	00:22:07	00:22:13	(door closes inside) But I haven't seen Derek in-in months, uh, not since he got out of prison, mm-mm.
283	00:22:14	00:22:16	He might be in Florida.
284	00:22:16	00:22:17	Florida. Yeah.
285	00:22:17	00:22:19	He loves it down there.
286	00:22:19	00:22:21	Can you give me a description of Derek?
287	00:22:21	00:22:30	Sure, sure. Uh, he's very tall, very, very lean, he has very long, dark hair that he won't cut, no matter how many times... Kind of like that?
288	00:22:37	00:22:40	So why'd you run?
289	00:22:40	00:22:42	I don't like cops.
290	00:22:42	00:22:44	We hear you don't like criminals, either.
291	00:22:45	00:22:46	Is that right?
292	00:22:46	00:22:48	We know you worked for Mickey Dunn.
293	00:22:48	00:22:52	We know you chased him, you ran him off the road, you stuck a gun in his face.
294	00:22:52	00:22:55	That's armed robbery.
295	00:22:55	00:22:57	If it happened.
296	00:22:58	00:23:00	Johnny D'Angelo said it did.
297	00:23:00	00:23:02	How is old scaredy-cat?
298	00:23:02	00:23:04	Credible.
299	00:23:04	00:23:06	There were a lot of rumors going around.
300	00:23:06	00:23:08	Mickey owned this, he owned that.
301	00:23:08	00:23:10	He owned a piece of the D.I.
302	00:23:10	00:23:12	We just happened to work there.
303	00:23:13	00:23:14	A lot of us guys did.
304	00:23:14	00:23:17	See, I'm thinking that's not the full story.
305	00:23:17	00:23:21	You're young; you don't know.
306	00:23:21	00:23:24	The memories, you get up there, they...
307	00:23:24	00:23:26	they start getting tricky.
308	00:23:26	00:23:29	Well, why don't you tell me what you do remember.
309	00:23:30	00:23:34	We took a little joyride, looking for Mickey Dunn.
310	00:23:34	00:23:41	But we never found him-- because someone else found him first, and who that was, I don't know.
311	00:23:41	00:23:48	Because, by the time we got there, whoever had killed Mickey Dunn was already gone.
312	00:23:48	00:23:51	Whoosh. Like a ghost.
313	00:23:51	00:23:53	I don't believe in ghosts.
314	00:23:53	00:23:58	But we got one scared guy, we got two dead guys, and we got you, Derek.
315	00:24:00	00:24:03	How do you feel about your buddies getting bumped off?
316	00:24:03	00:24:06	I'm all torn up inside.
317	00:24:09	00:24:11	You ever seen them?
318	00:24:11	00:24:13	Never.
319	00:24:13	00:24:17	But... they look like suspects.
320	00:24:17	00:24:19	And I think you're fishing.
321	00:24:19	00:24:23	And you got no legal right to hold me.
322	00:24:24	00:24:27	If you can't hold me...
323	00:24:27	00:24:30	you got to let me go.
324	00:24:52	00:24:54	Johnny?
325	00:24:54	00:24:55	Johnny D'Angelo?
326	00:25:10	00:25:13	Johnny D'Angelo! Las Vegas PD!
327	00:25:37	00:25:38	Yeah, go for Brass.
328	00:25:39	00:25:40	Scene is Code 4.
329	00:25:40	00:25:42	Johnny D'Angelo is not at his house.
330	00:25:42	00:25:45	Okay, got it. Thank you.
331	00:25:50	00:25:51	Do you smell that?
332	00:26:09	00:26:10	Phew...
333	00:26:26	00:26:29	Maybe it was the ghost of Mickey Dunn.
334	00:26:52	00:26:54	Sweet ride.
335	00:26:54	00:26:58	Know what makes human bones glow in the dark?
336	00:26:58	00:26:59	Love?
337	00:26:59	00:27:00	Tetracycline.
338	00:27:06	00:27:09	You want to help me with a little experiment?
339	00:27:09	00:27:11	Sure.
340	00:27:15	00:27:18	Grab that evidence bag?
341	00:27:21	00:27:23	Okay, let me see that.
342	00:27:23	00:27:25	Take this.
343	00:27:29	00:27:33	No go. Okay.
344	00:27:38	00:27:41	Looks like a match to me.
345	00:27:41	00:27:42	This is your experiment?
346	00:27:43	00:27:44	Actually, it is.
347	00:27:44	00:27:45	Thanks.
348	00:27:45	00:27:52	The victims-- Ken Billings, Mason Carter, Derek Paul and Johnny D'Angelo-- all murdered in the last 24 hours.
349	00:27:52	00:27:55	Four victims, three killers, no connection between them.
350	00:27:55	00:28:00	Could be he hired the others.
351	00:28:00	00:28:01	Could be. We don't know where they are.
352	00:28:02	00:28:09	We don't know who they are. Let's stick to what we do know-- all the victims worked for Mickey Dunn, who's been dead for 30 years.
353	00:28:09	00:28:10	Well, check this out.
354	00:28:10	00:28:14	I've been digging through the police files all morning, and guess who I found.
355	00:28:14	00:28:17	Officer Eddie Sanchez.
356	00:28:17	00:28:19	The Ghost Rider.
357	00:28:19	00:28:22	Now, assuming he's alive, the officer would be 55 today.
358	00:28:22	00:28:25	And he has family down in Mexico.
359	00:28:25	00:28:29	So you're thinking bike cop shoots Mickey Dunn, dumps the car and takes the money?
360	00:28:29	00:28:34	And with the exchange rate, lives like a king, south of the border, for the last 30 years.
361	00:28:34	00:28:36	Fast-forward-- Mickey Dunn's car gets discovered.
362	00:28:36	00:28:41	By a Mexican fisherman who would be just about the same age as the bike cop.
363	00:28:41	00:28:43	Only the discovery was bogus.
364	00:28:43	00:28:46	Turns out the hood ornament pulled from Lake Mead is a fake.
365	00:28:46	00:28:50	So... the fisherman was what, pulling off a hoax?
366	00:28:50	00:28:57	That or fraud-- he either planted that derringer at the crime scene, or maybe someone paid him to.
367	00:28:57	00:29:00	Either way, whoever did it knew that this car was down there.
368	00:29:00	00:29:02	And was missing the original hood ornament.
369	00:29:02	00:29:04	Who could know that?
370	00:29:04	00:29:07	Someone who was there the night it went down.
371	00:29:07	00:29:10	The motorcycle cop's looking better every minute.
372	00:29:11	00:29:14	Hey, don't rule out the ghost of Mickey Dunn.
373	00:29:14	00:29:21	your last vic, the one all pretzeled up in the oven, dead two days.
374	00:29:22	00:29:24	Before the Cadillac was found. Yeah.
375	00:29:25	00:29:29	Ah, and I got trace analysis on the sample Phillips collected on Chicken Johnny.
376	00:29:30	00:29:32	And? Alginate and plaster of Paris.
377	00:29:32	00:29:36	Combination used to make dental impressions.
378	00:29:36	00:29:39	And you don't even seem to be the teeniest bit surprised.
379	00:29:39	00:29:41	I'm not.
380	00:30:35	00:30:40	Our Mexican fisherman signed his television release form F. Kreuger.
381	00:30:40	00:30:41	Freddy Kreuger, Nightmare on Elm Street.
382	00:30:41	00:30:45	Yeah, and the karaoke singer was Michael Myers from Halloween.
383	00:30:45	00:30:47	Yeah, but...
384	00:30:47	00:30:49	who's the hotel killer now?
385	00:30:49	00:30:51	Who's Pamela Voorhees?
386	00:30:51	00:30:54	Friday the 13th. No, that's Jason.
387	00:30:54	00:30:56	Jason's the sequel.
388	00:30:56	00:31:01	Pamela, the mother, was the killer in the original-- that's the question that tripped up Drew Barrymore in Scream.
389	00:31:02	00:31:03	Yeah, and look what happened to her.
390	00:31:03	00:31:06	You watch slasher flicks?
391	00:31:07	00:31:09	With Lindsay, I... do.
392	00:31:09	00:31:11	They never get the spatter right.
393	00:31:11	00:31:22	All I know is the master of all scary movies was Lon Chaney, Sr., the man of a thousand faces, and that's what we're looking for.
394	00:31:28	00:31:35	The thing that really gets me is I talked to this killer dressed as Johnny D'Angelo, close enough to smell his breath and still he walks.
395	00:31:35	00:31:37	All the evidence says he was wearing state-of-the-art prosthetics.
396	00:31:37	00:31:40	I want to see him in an orange jumpsuit and cuffs.
397	00:31:40	00:31:42	He's got the real Johnny's wallet.
398	00:31:42	00:31:46	Well, if he's got his driver's license, he could be using it to try and escape.
399	00:31:46	00:31:49	He said the vic's car is parked in the parking lot.
400	00:31:49	00:31:50	He doesn't need his car.
401	00:31:50	00:31:51	He's got his face.
402	00:31:51	00:31:53	We'll pull his credit records.
403	00:31:53	00:31:54	Hope he bought something nice.
404	00:32:21	00:32:22	Put your hands on the wheel!
405	00:32:22	00:32:24	Put your hands on the steering wheel now!
406	00:32:25	00:32:27	Shut up and get out of the car.
407	00:32:32	00:32:34	Gun on the seat.
408	00:32:36	00:32:37	He's clean.
409	00:32:39	00:32:40	I thought I was clear on the shut up.
410	00:32:43	00:32:44	Pop the trunk.
411	00:32:56	00:33:00	Chainsaw-- sound familiar?
412	00:33:00	00:33:05	You get to be my age, all kinds of things ring a bell.
413	00:33:05	00:33:07	How about this? Any chimes?
414	00:33:07	00:33:10	That's a real good-lookin' boy.
415	00:33:10	00:33:13	But as the poet said...
416	00:33:18	00:33:19	It ain't me, babe.
417	00:33:19	00:33:21	Mickey Dunn.
418	00:33:21	00:33:23	Back from the dead.
419	00:33:24	00:33:26	You missed a spot.
420	00:33:27	00:33:29	I think I got all I need.
421	00:33:31	00:33:32	Just going along.
422	00:33:32	00:33:33	Well, keep going, Mickey.
423	00:33:33	00:33:34	Do you recognize him?
424	00:33:36	00:33:38	Could be a dead cop.
425	00:33:38	00:33:40	Yeah, Officer Eddie Sanchez.
426	00:33:41	00:33:43	He had a wife, two kids.
427	00:33:43	00:33:47	He also had a skin condition commonly known as acne which he treated with tetracycline.
428	00:33:48	00:33:53	That drug incorporated into his bones, making them glow under ultraviolet light.
429	00:33:55	00:33:56	Helped us identify him.
430	00:33:57	00:34:00	Thing's aren't looking too good for you, Mickey.
431	00:34:00	00:34:04	So now we know we got a dead cop's body in your old car.
432	00:34:04	00:34:06	So tell me what happened.
433	00:34:06	00:34:11	You were skipping town and Eddie Sanchez pulled you over and you shot him point-blank?
434	00:34:11	00:34:15	Like I told you, you missed a spot.
435	00:34:15	00:34:17	You missed a big spot.
436	00:34:17	00:34:20	I shot a lot of guys point-blank.
437	00:34:20	00:34:29	But this nosy piece of garbage bike cop that you two are so teared-up about...
438	00:34:29	00:34:35	I shot him from 40 feet away with a soaking-wet revolver.
439	00:34:35	00:34:38	It was one hell of a shot.
440	00:34:46	00:34:50	The poor dumb bastard didn't know what hit him.
441	00:34:50	00:34:51	He thought he'd been trained.
442	00:34:51	00:34:53	They don't prepare you for what I got.
443	00:34:58	00:35:00	Stop!
444	00:35:00	00:35:01	Stop or I'll shoot!
445	00:35:04	00:35:05	I said stop!
446	00:35:09	00:35:17	You found the skull had no teeth because I bashed 'em in with the barrel of my gun.
447	00:35:17	00:35:24	And all the forensics in the world ain't gonna show you that when I smashed his face in...
448	00:35:26	00:35:28	I liked it.
449	00:35:30	00:35:33	You're under arrest, Mickey, for murder.
450	00:35:34	00:35:38	Thank God you blew me off when I didn't know better.
451	00:35:39	00:35:41	Sam Braun's daughter.
452	00:35:45	00:35:47	You think that I would ever forget a face?
453	00:35:47	00:35:49	That face?
454	00:35:54	00:35:57	00 a.m. sharp.
455	00:36:01	00:36:11	Ask yourself what force on earth that kept me from your soft teenage graces.
456	00:36:13	00:36:18	Daddy.
457	00:36:18	00:36:19	Sam Braun stopped you?
458	00:36:19	00:36:26	Sam always said if I ever touched you, he'd tear me apart.
459	00:36:26	00:36:28	That took a big pair to say that to me.
460	00:36:28	00:36:32	He said that you were family.
461	00:36:32	00:36:33	Still, now he's gone.
462	00:36:34	00:36:36	We're here.
463	00:36:36	00:36:38	We could always give it a go.
464	00:36:38	00:36:41	You're not going anywhere.
465	00:36:48	00:36:49	He's having a heart attack.
466	00:36:49	00:36:52	Call a paramedic.
467	00:36:52	00:36:55	Bum ticker... right on time.
468	00:36:55	00:36:56	I'm dying.
469	00:36:56	00:36:59	Okay, take it easy, buddy.
470	00:36:59	00:37:00	Take it easy.
471	00:37:12	00:37:15	I'll give you a hint you're not in Heaven.
472	00:37:17	00:37:20	How long you been living with a bullet in your chest?
473	00:37:20	00:37:22	Who told you?
474	00:37:22	00:37:25	Why God invented X rays.
475	00:37:25	00:37:31	You'd like to take it out, have a closer look.
476	00:37:31	00:37:35	Ah, but you can't do that, not without killing me.
477	00:37:35	00:37:38	I'm guessing it's a .38...
478	00:37:41	00:37:47	...which matches the .38 that we took from the body of Derek Paul, which also matches the one that killed Eddie Sanchez.
479	00:37:54	00:37:57	You like horror movies, Mickey?
480	00:37:57	00:38:00	You know... I love 'em.
481	00:38:00	00:38:01	I got one for you.
482	00:38:02	00:38:04	Does it got a monster in it?
483	00:38:04	00:38:06	(chuckles) Yeah.
484	00:38:06	00:38:08	I bet you heard it.
485	00:38:08	00:38:11	It's strictly B-list stuff.
486	00:38:11	00:38:14	No-name cast, summer release.
487	00:38:14	00:38:18	Four Vegas punks run a monster off the road.
488	00:38:18	00:38:21	They shoot him, they rob him, they leave him for dead.
489	00:38:26	00:38:30	But everybody knows that shooting the monster and killing him are never the same.
490	00:38:44	00:38:49	A young honest cop arrives and with him comes opportunity.
491	00:38:53	00:38:56	The monster changes his name, his face...
492	00:39:01	00:39:04	...passes for human.
493	00:39:04	00:39:08	Rides off into the night.
494	00:39:10	00:39:14	And the legend is born.
495	00:39:14	00:39:15	The end.
496	00:39:15	00:39:19	Mickey, you know that real horror stories never end.
497	00:39:19	00:39:23	Oh, this one does.
498	00:39:25	00:39:35	It's been huge fun coming back, trying new faces, leading you all around town by the nostrils.
499	00:39:35	00:39:38	Setting up the big discovery.
500	00:39:38	00:39:40	Everybody, he know Mickey Dunn.
501	00:39:41	00:39:46	I'm Sally Jeffers, KRAC-TV, Lake Mead, Nevada.
502	00:39:46	00:39:49	Going after Kenneth...
503	00:39:49	00:39:51	I'm Mickey Dunn.
504	00:39:58	00:40:00	...taking out Mason...
505	00:40:04	00:40:11	...and the best part of all, the look on poor Johnny's face.
506	00:40:11	00:40:16	Not the most handsome guy in the world, but a face worth wearing.
507	00:40:16	00:40:23	And the hardest part-- learning Spanish.
508	00:40:26	00:40:27	Good times.
509	00:40:27	00:40:30	Why now?
510	00:40:30	00:40:35	Because that tiny piece of metal that Derek shot in my chest has finally moved.
511	00:40:35	00:40:41	Doctors gave me a week, maybe two, to live.
512	00:40:41	00:40:45	Figured I'd go out with a bang, never see the inside of a cell.
513	00:40:45	00:40:54	It's really funny how one little bullet can make things suddenly seem so clear.
514	00:40:59	00:41:01	You mean this bullet?
515	00:41:03	00:41:10	Mob doctors become Mob doctors because they sucked in the first place.
516	00:41:10	00:41:15	But we got a licensed surgeon that fixed you up good.
517	00:41:15	00:41:19	Cheer up, Mickey, you're gonna live another 20... 30 years.
518	00:41:20	00:41:24	And you'll be spending every day in the federal penitentiary.
519	00:41:24	00:41:28	But only until you die.
520	00:41:31	00:41:34	Well, I'll still go out a legend.
521	00:41:34	00:41:36	You haven't changed that.
522	00:41:36	00:41:39	Oh, you've been out of the game awhile.
523	00:41:39	00:41:43	The homies they have in the pen these days never heard of you.
524	00:41:43	00:41:46	That's impossible.
525	00:41:46	00:41:50	No, Mickey, that's life.
