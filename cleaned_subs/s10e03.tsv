0	00:00:36	00:00:40	Hiker spotted the body from that rise just after dawn.
1	00:00:51	00:00:55	Whoever did this put a lot more effort into the killing than the concealing.
2	00:00:55	00:00:57	Looks like it might have been spur-of-the-moment.
3	00:00:57	00:00:59	Or he didn't care if the victim was found, either way.
4	00:01:00	00:01:01	Go ahead and roll him, Dave.
5	00:01:07	00:01:14	If the killer's smart, he's already out of town, laying on a beach somewhere, drinking a margarita.
6	00:01:14	00:01:17	Well, let's hope he's not all that smart, then.
7	00:01:17	00:01:18	Any I.D. on him?
8	00:01:18	00:01:25	Mmm. There's no wallet, there's no cell, and there's no keys, unless you want to count this bicycle lock thingy.
9	00:01:26	00:01:29	Body is just going into rigor.
10	00:01:29	00:01:31	So, probably killed late last night.
11	00:01:31	00:01:34	Those look like defensive wounds on the wrist.
12	00:01:34	00:01:38	Multiple head wounds, any of which could have been fatal.
13	00:01:38	00:01:41	He pissed somebody off, didn't he?
14	00:01:44	00:01:46	What's the angriest you've ever been?
15	00:01:46	00:01:47	I've been mad enough to kill somebody.
16	00:01:48	00:01:49	Didn't do it.
17	00:01:49	00:01:50	What about you?
18	00:01:50	00:01:51	High threshold.
19	00:01:52	00:01:53	Short fuse.
20	00:01:53	00:02:01	Me, too. In high school, I vented my frustrations by devising elaborate tortures for my classmates.
21	00:02:02	00:02:03	In comic book form, of course.
22	00:02:04	00:02:12	Well, whether the killer woke up this morning intending to beat this guy to death or not, right now, he's a new man with a new plan.
23	00:02:12	00:02:14	And a big, fat secret.
24	00:02:16	00:02:18	Secrets are hard to keep.
25	00:03:12	00:03:14	Tire tracks head out to the road.
26	00:03:14	00:03:16	They're fresh and deep.
27	00:03:16	00:03:19	Driver must have floored it.
28	00:03:19	00:03:23	But, then again, he had a good reason to be in a hurry.
29	00:03:23	00:03:27	I have two different sets of shoe impressions here, in mud.
30	00:03:27	00:03:30	It hasn't rained out here for weeks.
31	00:03:30	00:03:32	Could be melted ice from a cooler.
32	00:03:33	00:03:38	Locals sometimes use these woods to get drunk, have target practice.
33	00:03:41	00:03:42	No, this isn't alcohol.
34	00:03:43	00:03:45	And he wasn't shot; he was bludgeoned.
35	00:03:59	00:04:19	Victim's male Caucasian, five-foot-ten, 155 pounds, probably in his mid-20s, with multiple BFTs to the head and back, as well as severe lacerations to the left wrist.
36	00:04:19	00:04:22	Lack of hemorrhagic tissue indicates the wound is postmortem.
37	00:04:22	00:04:29	approximately two centimeters deep, atypical for a defensive wound.
38	00:04:29	00:04:31	Which suggests the killer...
39	00:04:33	00:04:39	...was trying to dig... something... out.
40	00:04:43	00:04:47	This looks like an implantable RFID.
41	00:04:49	00:04:50	Radio Frequency Identification chip.
42	00:04:50	00:04:53	I know. They're used for tracking inventory at Wal-Mart.
43	00:04:53	00:04:58	But unless the 13th Amendment got repealed while I wasn't looking, that's not inventory.
44	00:04:58	00:04:59	Implantable RFIDs are pretty new.
45	00:05:00	00:05:05	There's some high-end nightclubs that give them to their VIPs to make it easier for them to run up a tab.
46	00:05:05	00:05:06	Oh, yeah.
47	00:05:06	00:05:12	Having a chip surgically implanted in your body is so much more convenient than putting a credit card in your pocket.
48	00:05:12	00:05:15	Well, not everything I wear out has pockets.
49	00:05:15	00:05:17	I'll buy you a purse. All right.
50	00:05:17	00:05:20	The chip itself looks intact.
51	00:05:20	00:05:24	If I can get my hands on a scanner, I might be able to tell who this belongs to.
52	00:05:24	00:05:26	No batteries required.
53	00:05:26	00:05:34	Just a little movement in a magnetic field to energize the circuit, which transmits a code, which gets sent to the access database, and... (buzzing and clicking)
54	00:05:34	00:05:36	(sighs) Just like magic.
55	00:05:36	00:05:38	That's impressive.
56	00:05:38	00:05:42	So, do you have any other tricks up your, um, arm?
57	00:05:42	00:05:43	Belinda?
58	00:05:43	00:05:44	I have those TPS reports...
59	00:05:45	00:05:47	Jason, this is Paulie Krill, facilities management.
60	00:05:47	00:05:50	Paulie, this is Jason Devereaux, our new I.T. guru.
61	00:05:50	00:05:52	I.T. geek-- it's okay to say it.
62	00:05:52	00:05:55	I had an RFID surgically implanted in my wrist.
63	00:05:55	00:05:57	It's, uh, practically the definition.
64	00:05:57	00:05:58	Did it hurt? No, it was, uh...
65	00:05:58	00:06:00	it was a little like getting a vaccination.
66	00:06:01	00:06:02	Without the autism.
67	00:06:02	00:06:04	Actually, that's anecdotal.
68	00:06:04	00:06:07	I read in... I tell most people that it was a suicide attempt.
69	00:06:07	00:06:09	It makes me appear dark and tormented.
70	00:06:09	00:06:10	I bet the ladies love that.
71	00:06:11	00:06:12	You tell me.
72	00:06:12	00:06:14	Lombard.
73	00:06:15	00:06:18	Sounds to me like your computer has a virus.
74	00:06:18	00:06:19	Oh, that's what I was afraid of.
75	00:06:20	00:06:21	Ah, well, come with me.
76	00:06:21	00:06:23	That's why we call it the Help Desk.
77	00:06:39	00:06:41	What? Sorry.
78	00:07:04	00:07:06	Where the hell is Devereaux?
79	00:07:06	00:07:07	I haven't seen him today.
80	00:07:07	00:07:09	Something wrong?
81	00:07:09	00:07:10	Yeah.
82	00:07:10	00:07:11	It's, uh...
83	00:07:12	00:07:13	Something is, uh...
84	00:07:13	00:07:15	very wrong.
85	00:07:15	00:07:17	Come here.
86	00:07:17	00:07:18	No, come here, you...
87	00:07:18	00:07:21	you've got something in your, something in your hair.
88	00:07:21	00:07:23	There, there, there, there...
89	00:07:26	00:07:27	There.
90	00:07:27	00:07:28	Got it.
91	00:07:28	00:07:29	Thank you.
92	00:07:30	00:07:33	What are you looking at?
93	00:07:33	00:07:35	A sexual harassment suit.
94	00:07:40	00:07:42	You're a very funny guy.
95	00:07:42	00:07:43	Hey.
96	00:07:43	00:07:47	Tell, uh, little Jason that I want that fixed ASAP.
97	00:07:47	00:07:50	From now on, this is no longer the Help Desk.
98	00:07:50	00:07:53	It's just... the desk.
99	00:07:54	00:07:56	Thanks.
100	00:07:56	00:07:57	You're welcome.
101	00:07:57	00:08:00	You ever think that some people would be better off dead?
102	00:08:01	00:08:03	What's gotten into you today?
103	00:08:05	00:08:06	I don't know.
104	00:08:06	00:08:10	Whatever it is, I like it.
105	00:08:27	00:08:30	So, they say people have a good side and a bad side.
106	00:08:30	00:08:32	What's the verdict?
107	00:08:32	00:08:34	I don't seem to have a bad side.
108	00:08:38	00:08:40	What do you have there?
109	00:08:40	00:08:42	Metal fragment from my crime scene.
110	00:08:43	00:08:48	Mandy was able to pull a few small partials and some smudges, but, uh...
111	00:08:48	00:08:50	nothing with enough detail to run through AFIS.
112	00:08:50	00:08:55	It's magnetic, which means it's ferrous, probably a steel alloy.
113	00:08:55	00:08:57	Layered steel.
114	00:08:57	00:08:58	Very high strength.
115	00:08:58	00:09:00	That fine line pattern looks like ferning.
116	00:09:00	00:09:04	Material deformation resulting from explosive force.
117	00:09:04	00:09:05	Yeah, possibly.
118	00:09:05	00:09:08	You see that kind of thing in a pipe bomb.
119	00:09:08	00:09:10	Is that what this is from?
120	00:09:10	00:09:11	I don't know.
121	00:09:19	00:09:21	Come on, damn it.
122	00:09:24	00:09:26	Yes.
123	00:09:29	00:09:30	You sound happy.
124	00:09:30	00:09:31	What's going on?
125	00:09:31	00:09:33	I just got the vic's name.
126	00:09:33	00:09:34	Jason Devereaux.
127	00:09:34	00:09:37	Nice.
128	00:09:37	00:09:38	I'll track down his phone records.
129	00:09:38	00:09:42	He lives at 1120 Marapasa Parkway, apartment number one.
130	00:09:43	00:09:44	And he drives a Ford Ranger.
131	00:09:44	00:09:47	That's consistent with the tire treads at the scene.
132	00:09:47	00:09:49	Kill a man, take his car.
133	00:09:49	00:09:50	Mmm. Bonus.
134	00:09:52	00:09:55	Man, that's three messages I've left for the property manager now.
135	00:09:55	00:09:58	Maybe he's got better things to do than cooperate with the law.
136	00:09:58	00:10:00	Wait, wait. Hold up a sec.
137	00:10:00	00:10:03	That's the victim's truck right there.
138	00:10:03	00:10:05	And trust me...
139	00:10:05	00:10:08	he was in no condition to drive it home.
140	00:10:22	00:10:24	Key's in the ignition.
141	00:10:24	00:10:26	Door's unlocked.
142	00:10:26	00:10:28	I'll check for prints.
143	00:10:30	00:10:34	Looks like everything's been wiped clean.
144	00:10:35	00:10:37	Maybe not everything.
145	00:10:37	00:10:40	Dispatch, this is Charlie-Zero-Six Sanders.
146	00:10:40	00:10:44	We need backup and tow at 1120 Marapasa Parkway.
147	00:10:44	00:10:46	Copy that, Charlie-Zero-Six.
148	00:10:46	00:10:50	Officers are already at that location, responding 406.
149	00:10:52	00:10:54	We came in on the other side of the complex.
150	00:10:54	00:10:56	That's why we missed each other.
151	00:10:56	00:11:00	Regular maid service entered the apartment a few hours ago.
152	00:11:00	00:11:02	Found the place trashed, called it in.
153	00:11:03	00:11:05	The unit's right back here.
154	00:11:05	00:11:06	Most of the electronics are gone.
155	00:11:06	00:11:08	TV was probably too big to carry out.
156	00:11:24	00:11:27	Security cable's been cut.
157	00:11:27	00:11:29	Killer didn't have a key. It was on the victim's belt.
158	00:11:29	00:11:33	So, the killer comes back to the vic's apartment.
159	00:11:33	00:11:34	Why?
160	00:11:34	00:11:36	Maybe to get something that ties him to the murder.
161	00:11:36	00:11:38	A computer, from the looks of it.
162	00:11:38	00:11:45	That suggests that the killer had a prior relationship with the vic-- family, friend, coworker. Mm-hmm.
163	00:11:45	00:11:49	Which means this...
164	00:11:49	00:11:52	is a pretty good place to start.
165	00:11:58	00:11:59	Hey!
166	00:11:59	00:12:01	Everybody shut up!
167	00:12:01	00:12:05	And stop trying to look busy for a minute, and give your attention down here.
168	00:12:05	00:12:06	Good afternoon.
169	00:12:06	00:12:08	I'm, uh, Captain Jim Brass.
170	00:12:08	00:12:12	I'm a detective with the Las Vegas Police Department.
171	00:12:12	00:12:16	I'm sorry to break up your day like this, but I'm here about Jason Devereaux.
172	00:12:16	00:12:17	He's not in yet.
173	00:12:17	00:12:21	What is this about? Mr. Devereaux is the subject of an active investigation.
174	00:12:21	00:12:23	I'll be talking to all of you individually.
175	00:12:23	00:12:26	These officers will pick up your contact information.
176	00:12:26	00:12:28	I promise it won't take too long.
177	00:12:28	00:12:30	Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
178	00:12:32	00:12:34	He's a hacker.
179	00:12:34	00:12:36	Bet it's a hacker thing.
180	00:12:36	00:12:39	Probably some high-tech black market credit card scam.
181	00:12:39	00:12:42	I read about it in Wired.
182	00:12:42	00:12:44	Some people, you just can't tell.
183	00:12:49	00:12:53	Well, all I know is the kid was here yesterday, he wasn't here today.
184	00:12:53	00:12:58	And since he didn't bother calling, he's also fired, so you know.
185	00:12:58	00:13:00	That's the least of his problems.
186	00:13:00	00:13:02	Well, I got just the place for you.
187	00:13:02	00:13:05	You pull the blinds, it's totally private and quiet.
188	00:13:05	00:13:08	You can pull out the rubber hose, nobody will even know.
189	00:13:08	00:13:12	You know, I'm curious, uh, do have you any problems with disgruntled employees lately?
190	00:13:12	00:13:14	(scoffs) No more than usual.
191	00:13:14	00:13:17	I mean, come on, you know what we do here.
192	00:13:17	00:13:18	Yeah, I can read the sign.
193	00:13:18	00:13:21	You're a support operations for the Tangiers.
194	00:13:21	00:13:24	Which mean we laminate badges, distribute uniforms, and issue parking permits.
195	00:13:24	00:13:28	We are the testicles of the casino business, my friend.
196	00:13:28	00:13:32	If you're working here, it's not 'cause you want to be.
197	00:13:43	00:13:46	Action figures and anime for the computer guy.
198	00:13:46	00:13:48	It's almost a cliché.
199	00:13:48	00:13:49	Let me guess, you were a GI Joe man?
200	00:13:49	00:13:52	No, but... my dad was.
201	00:13:52	00:13:56	Hey, Nick, we're finished up here.
202	00:13:56	00:13:57	Want me to help Barnes? All right, go ahead.
203	00:13:57	00:14:00	Nick, what do you make of this?
204	00:14:02	00:14:04	Looks like a long portrait.
205	00:14:04	00:14:07	They're big on photo-sharing sites.
206	00:14:08	00:14:11	Video art. With a little narcissism.
207	00:14:11	00:14:13	Well, one's not much without the other.
208	00:14:13	00:14:15	So, all electronic data goes back to the lab.
209	00:14:15	00:14:17	I'll do the honors.
210	00:14:17	00:14:19	Yeah, hold on there, Doctor, I'll save you the hassle.
211	00:14:19	00:14:21	I've got a drive duplicator in my truck.
212	00:14:21	00:14:23	I'll go grab it. All right.
213	00:14:39	00:14:43	According to Mr. Devereaux's phone records, the two of you called each other several times last night.
214	00:14:43	00:14:45	I'm his direct supervisor; we talk all the time.
215	00:14:45	00:14:48	00 p.m.
216	00:14:48	00:14:51	Jason said he was dealing with some sort of mail server glitch.
217	00:14:51	00:14:53	I.T.'s always dealing with something.
218	00:14:56	00:15:04	I thought it takes, like, 48 hours to report someone missing, so this can't be about him not showing up for work.
219	00:15:04	00:15:07	You seem more concerned about him than the rest of your colleagues.
220	00:15:07	00:15:08	We're friends.
221	00:15:08	00:15:10	I just want to know...
222	00:15:10	00:15:11	He's dead.
223	00:15:13	00:15:18	I'm going to be informing the rest of your coworkers, individually, about that fact.
224	00:15:18	00:15:21	Please don't discuss it with anybody, okay?
225	00:15:29	00:15:31	Hmm.
226	00:15:31	00:15:34	There are virtually no personal files on his computer.
227	00:15:34	00:15:36	Yeah, what do you make of that?
228	00:15:36	00:15:38	Some people take their privacy seriously.
229	00:15:43	00:15:45	His files have to be somewhere.
230	00:15:47	00:15:50	This thing's set up to remotely access another machine.
231	00:15:50	00:15:53	How much you want to bet it's the laptop stolen from his apartment?
232	00:15:55	00:15:58	Killed?
233	00:15:58	00:16:03	My God, that's... terrible.
234	00:16:03	00:16:06	Where were you last night, Mr. Krill?
235	00:16:06	00:16:07	Nowhere.
236	00:16:07	00:16:10	I... I got off work and went home as usual.
237	00:16:10	00:16:12	Do you have a wife or anybody who can verify that?
238	00:16:12	00:16:14	No. I live alone.
239	00:16:17	00:16:19	How would you describe your relationship to Mr. Devereaux?
240	00:16:21	00:16:23	I don't like your tone, Detective.
241	00:16:23	00:16:25	You don't like my tone?
242	00:16:25	00:16:27	One of your coworkers was just killed.
243	00:16:27	00:16:30	You don't seem to be too upset by it-- why is that?
244	00:16:34	00:16:35	I didn't like him.
245	00:16:36	00:16:41	Jason was always trying to get people to do his work for him.
246	00:16:41	00:16:47	And because he was good-looking and charming, I guess they did.
247	00:16:49	00:16:51	You do your job...
248	00:16:51	00:16:53	and you work hard.
249	00:16:53	00:16:56	That's how you get what you deserve in life.
250	00:16:56	00:16:59	At least that's the way I was raised.
251	00:17:00	00:17:02	Hmm.
252	00:17:23	00:17:26	Ooh, monoamine oxidase A.
253	00:17:26	00:17:28	Ask me anything. What do you want to know?
254	00:17:28	00:17:29	What do you know about it?
255	00:17:29	00:17:31	Kind of a lot.
256	00:17:31	00:17:34	My research group in grad school developed a protocol to synthesize the gene.
257	00:17:34	00:17:36	What's the case?
258	00:17:36	00:17:38	It's just something I'm working on.
259	00:17:38	00:17:42	You know, that specific mutation right there has actually been linked to violent behavior.
260	00:17:42	00:17:47	For example, there was this Dutch family, and all the males in the family who had that were rapists and arsonists.
261	00:17:48	00:17:51	And then mice without the MAOA gene all exhibited highly aggressive behavior.
262	00:17:51	00:17:54	MAOA deficiency doesn't make you violent.
263	00:17:54	00:17:56	I didn't say it did.
264	00:17:56	00:17:58	Just 'cause something might happen doesn't mean it will.
265	00:17:58	00:18:00	It's genetics, it's not destiny.
266	00:18:07	00:18:09	The vic's laptop is online there.
267	00:18:09	00:18:11	That's the victim's apartment building.
268	00:18:12	00:18:14	Can you isolate the unit?
269	00:18:14	00:18:15	Let's see.
270	00:18:21	00:18:24	His computer was configured for remote screen access.
271	00:18:24	00:18:30	So, that means I might be able to access the computer directly.
272	00:18:30	00:18:31	Got him.
273	00:18:31	00:18:33	That's what's on his machine right now.
274	00:18:35	00:18:37	This guy's a gamer, huh?
275	00:18:37	00:18:38	Mm-hmm.
276	00:18:38	00:18:40	But so am I.
277	00:18:40	00:18:43	Check this. Laptop cam on.
278	00:18:52	00:18:54	Okay...
279	00:18:54	00:18:56	Say cheese, dirtbag.
280	00:19:00	00:19:03	Look, I-I didn't kill nobody, I don't know nothing about nobody getting killed.
281	00:19:03	00:19:09	And here you are with a dead guy's laptop in your possession. Okay, yeah, sure, okay, I can admit to that.
282	00:19:10	00:19:13	I-I was heading outta my crib and I walked by this apartment.
283	00:19:13	00:19:15	See, the door was just wide open.
284	00:19:15	00:19:19	All this high-end gear in there, it's just sitting there, unattended.
285	00:19:19	00:19:21	Yeah, all locked up with security cables, right?
286	00:19:21	00:19:23	Well, well, yeah, that's why I go back, get the bolt cutters.
287	00:19:25	00:19:29	You know, what with Christmas coming up and all.
288	00:19:29	00:19:31	Yeah.
289	00:19:33	00:19:35	Write it down.
290	00:19:35	00:19:37	He's nothing.
291	00:19:37	00:19:39	He's just a random petty thief.
292	00:19:39	00:19:42	The killer probably left the apartment door open to make it look like a robbery.
293	00:19:42	00:19:45	Well, Jason Devereaux had a juvee record.
294	00:19:45	00:19:46	I had it unsealed.
295	00:19:46	00:19:50	A lot of antisocial tendencies in there.
296	00:19:50	00:19:53	He also did time on a work farm for peddling Ritalin in high school.
297	00:19:53	00:19:55	You think it's a drug thing?
298	00:19:55	00:19:57	His tox came back positive for methamphetamine.
299	00:19:57	00:20:00	Point-oh-two mikes per mil.
300	00:20:00	00:20:02	That's a party dose.
301	00:20:02	00:20:03	Maybe.
302	00:20:03	00:20:08	But it wouldn't be the first time that a regular guy with a steady job threw it all away for the great taste of meth.
303	00:20:26	00:20:28	Desi?
304	00:20:28	00:20:30	Lucy?
305	00:20:32	00:20:47	You're doing Desorption Electrospray Ionization-- DESI-- a spray of electrically charged water dissolves compounds in the fingerprints, which creates a thin film that gets scattered back to the mass-spec identifying what the suspect touched.
306	00:20:47	00:20:49	I know how it works.
307	00:20:49	00:20:51	I'm doing it. Yes.
308	00:20:51	00:20:57	But it was a lucid and entertaining explanation of the process.
309	00:20:57	00:21:03	You know, um, I did process that metal and there was no unusual residue on the surface.
310	00:21:03	00:21:05	Are you expecting to find something in the prints?
311	00:21:06	00:21:10	I was at a DEA seminar last month, uh, they were discussing making one-pot meth.
312	00:21:10	00:21:15	You mix the chemicals in a container which you leave in the woods to vent and cure.
313	00:21:15	00:21:19	But if someone comes along and disturbs it at the wrong moment in the reaction...
314	00:21:19	00:21:20	Kaboom.
315	00:21:20	00:21:21	So it's a drug thing.
316	00:21:21	00:21:23	That's what everyone seems to think.
317	00:21:23	00:21:28	Homeland Security was missing out on a real asset with Jason Devereaux.
318	00:21:28	00:21:36	His laptop was loaded with keyloggers and corporate spyware set up to copy e-mails and files from a dozen people in his office.
319	00:21:36	00:21:38	There's gigabytes of stuff here.
320	00:21:38	00:21:40	He was spying on everybody he worked with.
321	00:21:40	00:21:42	Maybe he read something he shouldn't have.
322	00:21:42	00:21:45	Something worth killing him for.
323	00:21:45	00:21:48	This isn't a drug thing.
324	00:21:48	00:21:53	Traces of RDX in the fingerprints-- high explosive.
325	00:21:53	00:21:55	That's disturbing.
326	00:21:55	00:21:56	Terrorism comes to mind.
327	00:21:56	00:21:59	It certainly does.
328	00:22:43	00:22:46	I know what you're up to, Paulie.
329	00:22:46	00:22:48	And I want to help.
330	00:22:48	00:22:50	What are you talking about?
331	00:22:57	00:23:00	What are you doing?
332	00:23:00	00:23:03	I haven't been here long, but I can see the way things are.
333	00:23:03	00:23:09	People putting you down, day after day, in little ways, making you feel like you're nothing.
334	00:23:09	00:23:12	Hey, Paulie, you're going to have to stay late and do inventory.
335	00:23:12	00:23:16	Hey, Paulie, we're out of coffee again, would you mind?
336	00:23:16	00:23:19	Hey, Paulie, love the shirt.
337	00:23:19	00:23:23	I know what it feels like to be on the outside.
338	00:23:23	00:23:25	And I know you want to make them pay.
339	00:23:25	00:23:28	I don't know what you're talking about.
340	00:23:34	00:23:35	How did you...
341	00:23:35	00:23:37	How did you do that?
342	00:23:37	00:23:39	Your life's an open book to me, Paulie.
343	00:23:39	00:23:50	I know what you really want to do to this place, deep down in your heart, when it feels like Lombard and this job are grinding you down.
344	00:23:50	00:23:56	I've got an uncle that works in the mining business.
345	00:23:56	00:24:01	I could get a brick of RDX with one phone call.
346	00:24:01	00:24:06	No questions asked.
347	00:24:06	00:24:10	I can make all your dreams come true, Paulie.
348	00:24:10	00:24:14	All you gotta do is let me.
349	00:24:36	00:24:40	Okay, these are the colleagues whose trust Jason Devereaux was violating.
350	00:24:40	00:24:44	Knowing the deep, dark secrets of your coworkers is a slippery slope.
351	00:24:44	00:24:48	There was a time in my life that would've come in handy.
352	00:24:48	00:24:51	I used to work alongside an angel of death, remember?
353	00:24:51	00:24:52	Hmm.
354	00:24:53	00:24:55	It's mostly online shopping and DVD rentals.
355	00:24:55	00:24:57	I take it the office firewalls porn?
356	00:24:57	00:24:58	Don't they all.
357	00:24:59	00:25:04	But if the victim was poking into everyone's private life, this could've been an extortion scheme gone bad, a crime of passion.
358	00:25:04	00:25:07	Wouldn't explain the explosives we found on the metal fragment.
359	00:25:07	00:25:15	Archie and I did global searches for words like explosives, and unless Mr. Lombard's recent bout of diarrhea counts, we struck out.
360	00:25:15	00:25:17	Brass ran scent dogs through this whole office.
361	00:25:17	00:25:20	The only thing found were traces of RDX in Jason's cubicle.
362	00:25:20	00:25:27	Well, his uncle runs a mining company and according to Jason's juvee record, he enjoyed blowing things up as a child.
363	00:25:27	00:25:30	Maybe he was just pursuing his hobby into adulthood.
364	00:25:30	00:25:36	Well, if there's an explanation in there, it looks like we're going to have to find it the old-fashioned way and read the lot of them.
365	00:25:36	00:25:39	Split it up by individual, starting with the day of the murder and work your way back.
366	00:25:39	00:25:41	Okay.
367	00:26:01	00:26:03	Oh, hey, George.
368	00:26:03	00:26:08	Mr. Lombard wanted me to bring him the new swatches Oh, yeah. for the bellman uniforms.
369	00:26:08	00:26:11	Looking for Ms. Mayfield, but... Yeah, sure, fine, whatever.
370	00:26:11	00:26:13	Okay? Thanks.
371	00:26:18	00:26:20	So, how'd you know this thing was even in here?
372	00:26:20	00:26:27	I found it logging inventory a few months back, so I contacted the City Planning...
373	00:26:27	00:26:28	City Planning Department, that's right, I remember.
374	00:26:29	00:26:33	They, uh, they e-mailed you the building plans. Yeah.
375	00:26:33	00:26:36	Okay, coast is clear.
376	00:26:37	00:26:40	This was an electrical conduit.
377	00:26:40	00:26:45	It goes about 150 feet outside the building, comes up on the other side of the security fence.
378	00:26:45	00:26:46	Okay.
379	00:26:46	00:26:48	Get in.
380	00:26:48	00:26:50	What? Get in.
381	00:26:50	00:26:52	Go all the way out and then come back.
382	00:26:54	00:26:55	You said this was your exit strategy.
383	00:26:55	00:26:56	I just want to be sure that it works.
384	00:26:57	00:26:58	Go ahead, I'm gonna, I'm gonna stand guard.
385	00:26:58	00:27:00	Jason, it's totally dark in there.
386	00:27:00	00:27:01	I don't even have a flashlight.
387	00:27:02	00:27:06	Hey, there's an app for that.
388	00:27:51	00:27:53	Hello?
389	00:27:57	00:28:01	Okay, okay.
390	00:28:09	00:28:11	What are you doing down here?
391	00:28:11	00:28:12	Oh, hey, there, George! Good to see you again.
392	00:28:12	00:28:14	Where's Paulie?
393	00:28:14	00:28:15	I'm sorry? Where's Paulie?
394	00:28:15	00:28:17	You know, I don't know.
395	00:28:17	00:28:18	He was just here.
396	00:28:18	00:28:20	I'm calling Lombard! Whoa!
397	00:28:20	00:28:22	George, George, calm down a second!
398	00:28:22	00:28:24	I don't know-- Paulie's gonna be back in a second.
399	00:28:24	00:28:28	Hey, George, I can explain.
400	00:28:29	00:28:33	That phone has outstanding reception.
401	00:28:33	00:28:36	Wait, that was a joke?
402	00:28:36	00:28:37	You were joking?
403	00:28:38	00:28:40	Always expect the unexpected.
404	00:28:40	00:28:41	Are you kidding me?!
405	00:28:41	00:28:43	Relax, I'm just toughening you up.
406	00:28:43	00:28:45	You're gonna thank me later.
407	00:28:45	00:28:46	Did you get all the way out?
408	00:28:46	00:28:50	That conduit isn't going to do us any good if you're just counting on old George to be there...
409	00:28:53	00:28:55	We don't need him.
410	00:28:55	00:28:56	You're not authorized to be in this...
411	00:28:56	00:28:59	How did you, how did you...?
412	00:28:59	00:29:02	Never underestimate the power of a sexy geek...
413	00:29:02	00:29:04	with a Flash drive.
414	00:29:06	00:29:09	I got all the access codes we need.
415	00:29:12	00:29:14	Right over here, Ms. Devereaux.
416	00:29:15	00:29:16	Um...
417	00:29:16	00:29:19	they said I could collect my son's things.
418	00:29:19	00:29:20	Personal effects only, ma'am.
419	00:29:20	00:29:22	And write down whatever you take.
420	00:29:30	00:29:33	Excuse me, are you Jason's mom?
421	00:29:33	00:29:38	I'm Paulie Krill; my condolences.
422	00:29:38	00:29:41	You look like you could use some help.
423	00:29:41	00:29:44	That'd be nice.
424	00:29:50	00:29:53	Were you friends with Jase?
425	00:29:53	00:29:55	Um, work friends mostly.
426	00:29:55	00:29:57	You didn't really know him then?
427	00:29:57	00:29:59	No, not really.
428	00:30:08	00:30:10	I always figured things would turn out bad for him.
429	00:30:18	00:30:23	Jase was a difficult boy.
430	00:30:24	00:30:26	High-spirited.
431	00:30:28	00:30:30	That's rough when there's no dad around.
432	00:30:33	00:30:39	Sometimes I think I took extra shifts at work so I wouldn't have to go home.
433	00:30:54	00:30:56	Here you go.
434	00:30:57	00:31:01	I hope he wasn't awful to you.
435	00:31:01	00:31:05	Don't blame yourself.
436	00:31:14	00:31:16	Ray.
437	00:31:16	00:31:18	Highway Patrol just brought this in.
438	00:31:18	00:31:22	They found it on the side of the road near Mount Charleston, about a mile away from your crime scene.
439	00:31:22	00:31:25	Metal's consistent with the exploded fragment you found.
440	00:31:26	00:31:27	And there's blood on the edge.
441	00:31:27	00:31:34	Which I sampled with a high-quality Lynn-Peavey integra swab to compare with the vic's.
442	00:31:36	00:31:40	It could be what made the impact wound on his back.
443	00:31:40	00:31:42	It could be our murder weapon.
444	00:31:42	00:31:44	Whatever it is.
445	00:32:08	00:32:10	Stokes.
446	00:32:10	00:32:11	Hey, Nick, it's Wendy.
447	00:32:11	00:32:14	I got the DNA results for the semen stain in the victim's car.
448	00:32:20	00:32:21	Hey.
449	00:32:21	00:32:23	You okay?
450	00:32:23	00:32:26	Yeah. Clearly.
451	00:32:35	00:32:36	Thanks.
452	00:32:36	00:32:37	You're welcome.
453	00:32:43	00:32:45	Belinda, I know you liked Jason.
454	00:32:45	00:32:49	But he was obviously into some pretty bad stuff.
455	00:32:49	00:32:52	Maybe he wasn't as nice a guy as you think he was.
456	00:32:52	00:32:54	They never are.
457	00:32:54	00:32:57	Yeah.
458	00:32:58	00:33:01	Look, it's about time to get out of here.
459	00:33:01	00:33:03	You up for a drink?
460	00:33:05	00:33:07	Or ten?
461	00:33:07	00:33:09	Just us?
462	00:33:10	00:33:12	Yeah.
463	00:33:12	00:33:14	It's been a weird day.
464	00:33:14	00:33:15	What the hell.
465	00:33:15	00:33:17	Let's make it a weird night.
466	00:33:19	00:33:21	Sure.
467	00:33:21	00:33:24	Ms. Mayfield, I need you to come to the police station.
468	00:33:24	00:33:26	Why? Do you mind?
469	00:33:26	00:33:28	No, he doesn't have... I already talked with you.
470	00:33:28	00:33:34	You didn't talk to me about what your DNA was doing in the victim's car, unless you want to deny sleeping with him.
471	00:33:34	00:33:36	Go with this officer.
472	00:33:53	00:33:57	You know what the weird part of this is, I mean, at least from your point of view.
473	00:33:58	00:34:06	The only reason we have your DNA in our system is because you gave it to us three years ago, when you filed charges against your scumbag ex-husband for domestic abuse.
474	00:34:06	00:34:08	Believe me, I remember that.
475	00:34:08	00:34:09	Oh, I'm sure you do.
476	00:34:09	00:34:14	And I'm not telling you something you don't know, but you've got a history of picking the wrong guy.
477	00:34:14	00:34:17	I mean, I have statements from your coworkers.
478	00:34:17	00:34:21	Jason Devereaux was banging half the women in your office.
479	00:34:21	00:34:23	So, what do they say about a woman scorned?
480	00:34:23	00:34:32	We found Jason's Flash drive in her purse, filled with passwords, account information, and RFID access codes to nearly every secure area in that building.
481	00:34:32	00:34:34	That screams white collar crime to me.
482	00:34:35	00:34:36	What's the scam?
483	00:34:36	00:34:37	I mean, what is there to steal?
484	00:34:37	00:34:39	That place isn't exactly a bank.
485	00:34:39	00:34:44	I don't know, but Jason had an E-ticket on Pacific Vista departing for Cabo tomorrow morning.
486	00:34:44	00:34:45	What?!
487	00:34:45	00:34:48	Yeah, so, unless he just happened to be planning a vacation...
488	00:34:48	00:34:50	More like trying to skip town.
489	00:34:50	00:34:53	Let's see if anybody else from his work went with him.
490	00:34:53	00:34:56	I hear Cabo's very romantic this time of year.
491	00:34:56	00:34:58	We were just going away for the weekend.
492	00:34:58	00:35:00	No, you were going away for good.
493	00:35:01	00:35:04	We have your access codes on Jason's Flash drive.
494	00:35:04	00:35:09	I gave him that so he could reprogram my boss' access card, so it wouldn't work.
495	00:35:10	00:35:11	Something wrong?
496	00:35:11	00:35:14	It was a plan.
497	00:35:14	00:35:19	You and Jason were cooking up some scheme in the office, things went bad, and one working stiff makes another worker stiff.
498	00:35:19	00:35:20	I had a fling with him.
499	00:35:20	00:35:22	That was it!
500	00:35:22	00:35:24	I didn't kill him.
501	00:35:24	00:35:32	The piece that Highway Patrol brought in is part of the inside cover of a Traeger GR-7 jewelry safe.
502	00:35:32	00:35:35	So Jason and whoever killed him were out in the woods blowing up a safe?
503	00:35:35	00:35:36	Apparently.
504	00:35:36	00:35:40	All of which suggests they were planning an old-fashioned robbery.
505	00:35:40	00:35:44	You know that my dad was a casino boss, right?
506	00:35:44	00:35:50	Well, every few weeks, he had to collect the revenue from all of his low-end, low-volume operations.
507	00:35:50	00:35:55	Nickel slots from bars and mini-marts, grocery store Keno, that sort of thing?
508	00:35:55	00:35:57	We're not talking small potatoes, either.
509	00:35:57	00:36:00	Quarter mil, easy, even on a bad month.
510	00:36:00	00:36:08	An armored truck would go around town making the pickups, but when they were done, the bank would be closed.
511	00:36:08	00:36:16	So, they would drive to Sam's business office where he kept a big, old vault in a room all by itself.
512	00:36:16	00:36:23	Sam loved showing it off to me as the sacks of coins and bricks of cash went into it.
513	00:36:23	00:36:32	Anyway, the money would go into the vault and stay there until the next morning, when the armored car guys would return and take it to the bank.
514	00:36:32	00:36:36	I think we need to find out if there's a safe on the premises.
515	00:36:47	00:36:50	Oh, hi, there.
516	00:36:52	00:36:53	I'm David Hodges.
517	00:36:53	00:36:57	Welcome to Lynn-Peavey Corporation's Wonderful World of Forensics.
518	00:36:57	00:37:01	Today on our show-- the scintillating science of swabbing.
519	00:37:01	00:37:04	I don't think the girl had anything to do with it.
520	00:37:04	00:37:07	I think she's more of a victim than a killer.
521	00:37:07	00:37:08	Okay. What about his safe?
522	00:37:08	00:37:17	No, not yet. Tangiers Corporate doesn't want to talk about how and where they keep their money until they get the okay from their bosses in New York, and back East, they're still in bed, so I'm working up a warrant.
523	00:37:17	00:37:19	Thanks, Jim. You know how to find me.
524	00:37:29	00:37:31	What are you doing?
525	00:37:31	00:37:32	Proof of principle.
526	00:37:32	00:37:34	Mythbusters style.
527	00:37:34	00:37:40	When you landed on the idea that there might be a safe involved, we had Archie and Greg search Jason's files for the term.
528	00:37:40	00:37:46	It turns out that both the victim and another employee, Paulie Krill, had been doing a lot of Web searches on safecracking.
529	00:37:46	00:37:52	That is a Traeger GR-7 jewelry safe, same model as the one that we found evidence of in the woods.
530	00:37:52	00:37:54	We bought it from the one local store that carries them.
531	00:37:54	00:37:57	And the last one they sold was to Paulie Krill.
532	00:37:57	00:38:00	I take it the fact that you're both still here means there's a broadcast out?
533	00:38:00	00:38:01	Yes.
534	00:38:01	00:38:03	Paulie Krill is not at home.
535	00:38:03	00:38:06	His office is closed for the night.
536	00:38:06	00:38:09	In any event, this safe features what's known as a glass re-locker.
537	00:38:09	00:38:20	When someone attempts to drill the door, a glass plate inside the safe breaks, activating additional locking bolts, which render the safe practically impervious.
538	00:38:22	00:38:26	There's a Traeger GR-17 safe in the vic's office.
539	00:38:26	00:38:29	That is the big brother to this model, but the physics is the same.
540	00:38:29	00:38:35	These guys were also renting heist movies, among them The Score, which is not a bad film. I liked it.
541	00:38:35	00:38:40	Safecracker cuts a hole in the top of the safe, fills it with water, and then drops in a high explosive depth charge.
542	00:38:40	00:38:41	There was water in the vic's truck.
543	00:38:42	00:38:43	And mud at the scene.
544	00:38:43	00:38:49	Water is an incompressible fluid, so it transfers the force of the explosion to the door before the glass re-locker can activate.
545	00:38:49	00:38:50	That was their plan.
546	00:38:54	00:38:58	That... was... awesome.
547	00:39:00	00:39:07	Now all we got to do is hang loose for a couple of days until the money comes in, and then we cash out.
548	00:39:07	00:39:08	Yo hablo español, mi amigo.
549	00:39:10	00:39:11	I hope you do, too.
550	00:39:11	00:39:12	I can't go through with it.
551	00:39:12	00:39:14	What?
552	00:39:14	00:39:15	No, no, no, no, no.
553	00:39:15	00:39:17	No, no, not now.
554	00:39:17	00:39:19	No, you are not backing out of this now, man.
555	00:39:19	00:39:21	Not now. It wasn't real!
556	00:39:21	00:39:22	It was just a game.
557	00:39:22	00:39:23	It was... It was a secret.
558	00:39:23	00:39:25	Nobody was even supposed to know about it.
559	00:39:25	00:39:26	Hey, hey!
560	00:39:26	00:39:42	For 20 years, all you do is fill in the space in that lousy little cubicle, and still, you somehow manage to come up with the perfect plan to rip off all of the losers that you work for that make you feel like crap day after day.
561	00:39:42	00:39:47	I give you the thing that you need to make it all go boom, and-and you don't want to go through with it? No.
562	00:39:47	00:39:49	I can't. I can't.
563	00:39:49	00:39:51	Yes, you can, Paul.
564	00:39:51	00:39:55	For once in your life, you're actually going to do something, something big.
565	00:39:55	00:39:57	You want this, I know you do!
566	00:39:57	00:39:58	I've seen it in your eyes.
567	00:39:59	00:40:05	Staring at all those things that you can't get-- money, respect, Belinda.
568	00:40:05	00:40:06	No!
569	00:40:06	00:40:07	I don't care!
570	00:40:07	00:40:09	I'm not doing it.
571	00:40:09	00:40:10	I can't! That's it!
572	00:40:10	00:40:11	I am out!
573	00:40:12	00:40:14	Fine!
574	00:40:14	00:40:16	You want out, you're out!
575	00:40:16	00:40:21	I don't need you to carry this off any more, anyway.
576	00:40:22	00:40:28	Breathe a word of this to anyone anywhere, and I will hunt you down and put a bullet in your head.
577	00:40:28	00:40:30	I swear.
578	00:40:34	00:40:37	Empty space.
579	00:40:37	00:40:40	That's all you are.
580	00:41:20	00:41:21	Mr. Krill!
581	00:41:21	00:41:23	LVPD! Open up!
582	00:41:23	00:41:25	Paulie, drop it!
583	00:41:25	00:41:26	Open this door!
584	00:41:26	00:41:27	Open up!
585	00:41:49	00:41:51	Mr. Krill!
586	00:41:51	00:41:55	Hey! Don't do it, Paulie!
587	00:42:46	00:42:48	Can't get it open!
588	00:42:48	00:42:50	Paulie!
589	00:42:50	00:42:52	(pounding on door) Get the door open! Let's go!
590	00:42:52	00:42:54	I can't find my card. Try harder!
591	00:42:54	00:42:56	Oh, wait. I found it.
592	00:43:05	00:43:07	(groaning) Call it in.
593	00:43:21	00:43:23	I knew...
594	00:43:23	00:43:25	it would work.
