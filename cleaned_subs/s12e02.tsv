0	00:00:10	00:00:15	What if someone sees us?
1	00:00:15	00:00:17	Please, this place is like a ghost town.
2	00:00:17	00:00:19	Well, what about God?
3	00:00:19	00:00:21	He sees everything.
4	00:00:21	00:00:26	Well, I mean, if he has a problem with it, he'll let us know, right?
5	00:00:51	00:00:52	Uh, you're, um... What?
6	00:00:52	00:00:54	There's, uh...
7	00:00:54	00:00:56	You're covered in... (screams)
8	00:00:57	00:00:59	Is it really...?
9	00:00:59	00:01:01	Blood?
10	00:01:01	00:01:03	Yeah.
11	00:01:04	00:01:06	Excuse me.
12	00:01:11	00:01:15	So, I talked to Kid Casanova.
13	00:01:15	00:01:18	He tells me that God's wrath rained down.
14	00:01:18	00:01:24	You know, you lose the blood and the police tape, my wife could really go for a neighborhood like this.
15	00:01:24	00:01:28	Very eco-friendly.
16	00:01:28	00:01:30	Not so friendly tonight.
17	00:01:30	00:01:33	The Chambliss family. Quadruple homicide.
18	00:01:33	00:01:35	You're gonna need backup.
19	00:01:35	00:01:37	You get many Stigmata houses in Seattle?
20	00:01:37	00:01:40	No, no, our saints bleed coffee up there.
21	00:01:40	00:01:42	The owner was a pharmaceutical salesman.
22	00:01:42	00:01:43	Laid off six months ago.
23	00:01:43	00:01:45	Okay, thank you. I got it.
24	00:01:47	00:01:51	Well, I hope Moonbeam brought his booties and a strong stomach.
25	00:02:32	00:02:35	...retain possession, very, very lucky.
26	00:02:35	00:02:37	Lining up for the next play, Al.
27	00:02:37	00:02:40	That'll make it second down and a loss of five on the play.
28	00:02:40	00:02:42	Second down and 15...
29	00:03:17	00:03:19	Greenhouse gray water system.
30	00:03:19	00:03:22	Recycles everything that goes down the drain.
31	00:03:22	00:03:24	And out to the sprinklers.
32	00:03:24	00:03:26	Explains why the house was bleeding.
33	00:03:32	00:03:33	Look at this.
34	00:03:33	00:03:38	When was the last time you bought a rainbow marshmallow?
35	00:03:38	00:03:39	When my daughter was eight.
36	00:03:39	00:03:41	Oh, God.
37	00:03:48	00:03:49	Do you feel that?
38	00:03:49	00:03:52	Change in temperature.
39	00:04:14	00:04:15	Oh.
40	00:04:18	00:04:21	There's no blood on her pajamas.
41	00:04:21	00:04:23	She's been redressed.
42	00:04:23	00:04:25	Cleaned up, tucked in.
43	00:04:26	00:04:28	By somebody who cared about her.
44	00:04:38	00:04:41	This was where she was shot.
45	00:04:47	00:04:49	What's blood doing way up there?
46	00:05:25	00:05:28	Wait here till you get the Code Four.
47	00:05:38	00:05:40	Got someone over here. Show me your hands!
48	00:05:40	00:05:43	Get down on your knees! Get down on your knees!
49	00:05:43	00:05:45	Sounds like a Code Four to me.
50	00:05:45	00:05:48	Let me see your hands! Get down on the ground! Get down on the ground!
51	00:05:48	00:05:50	Let me see those hands! Get him down!
52	00:05:50	00:05:52	Get him on the ground! Get on the ground! I loved her!
53	00:05:52	00:05:55	Do not resist! Cuff him up.
54	00:05:55	00:05:59	I loved her! Oh, God!
55	00:05:59	00:06:01	Cuff him. Get him out of here!
56	00:06:36	00:06:38	You are going the wrong way.
57	00:06:38	00:06:40	Make a U-turn at the next intersection.
58	00:06:40	00:06:43	Intersection? You are going the wrong way.
59	00:06:43	00:06:45	There's no road!
60	00:06:45	00:06:46	You are going the wrong way.
61	00:06:46	00:06:48	Recalculating.
62	00:07:00	00:07:02	You have arrived at your destination.
63	00:07:07	00:07:09	Your dad teach you how to drive?
64	00:07:09	00:07:12	Funny. You guys could use a few more freeways around here.
65	00:07:12	00:07:14	Who's inside?
66	00:07:14	00:07:16	Me and Greg. You want to take the perimeter?
67	00:07:16	00:07:18	I got my sunscreen.
68	00:07:18	00:07:20	Ah, there you go.
69	00:07:20	00:07:21	Oh, speak of the devil, there's the old man there.
70	00:07:22	00:07:25	Enjoy yourself. (chuckles)
71	00:07:25	00:07:27	Hey, Conrad, how you doing? Nick.
72	00:07:27	00:07:30	Good to see ya.
73	00:07:32	00:07:34	Cigars?
74	00:07:34	00:07:35	Kills the decomp.
75	00:07:35	00:07:37	I always had a few on hand.
76	00:07:37	00:07:39	So, uh, you settling in?
77	00:07:39	00:07:40	Yeah.
78	00:07:42	00:07:44	You make an appearance at every crime scene?
79	00:07:44	00:07:46	I usually roll on anything over a double.
80	00:07:46	00:07:49	And this one, press is gonna be all over it.
81	00:07:49	00:07:50	I got stuff to do.
82	00:07:50	00:07:52	Undersheriff Ecklie!
83	00:07:52	00:07:55	Is it true you have a suspect in custody?
84	00:07:55	00:07:57	Can you tell us if you have any leads? Can you tell us if you have a suspect?
85	00:07:57	00:08:02	Look, look, all I can say is we have a person of interest in custody and that we intend to question him.
86	00:08:02	00:08:11	Is there any additional information As a matter of due diligence, we're performing a thorough search of the neighborhood, including one of the neighboring homes.
87	00:08:23	00:08:30	Uh, don't mean to interrupt your search, but, uh, I've torn this place apart-- there's no gun, no knife... Did you notice the decor?
88	00:08:30	00:08:32	You in the market for a decorator?
89	00:08:32	00:08:35	The kid's 27 years old.
90	00:08:35	00:08:37	He answers phones at a body shop.
91	00:08:37	00:08:41	Yet all the furniture in this place looks like it belongs to his parents.
92	00:08:41	00:08:43	Like hand-me-downs.
93	00:08:43	00:08:49	The only room that reflects his taste is this one, and it's laid out exactly like...
94	00:08:49	00:08:51	like the dead little girl's room.
95	00:08:51	00:08:53	Even has the same dollhouse.
96	00:09:00	00:09:02	Not exactly the same.
97	00:09:10	00:09:12	Ahh...
98	00:09:19	00:09:22	Guy lived just across the way.
99	00:09:22	00:09:24	He's been watching her for years.
100	00:10:00	00:10:02	Sanders?
101	00:10:02	00:10:04	I got boot prints.
102	00:10:04	00:10:05	Me, too.
103	00:10:05	00:10:07	(phone rings) Mine have been here a while.
104	00:10:07	00:10:10	I think somebody made a habit out of hiding back here.
105	00:10:10	00:10:12	Yeah. Looking in.
106	00:10:12	00:10:15	Just got a text from Catherine.
107	00:10:15	00:10:17	Our perp is a peeper.
108	00:10:17	00:10:20	Can I get you anything?
109	00:10:20	00:10:21	Want a soda, something?
110	00:10:21	00:10:24	Cherry cola would be nice.
111	00:10:24	00:10:25	I'm sure it would.
112	00:10:25	00:10:27	I know what you think.
113	00:10:27	00:10:30	You're just lucky I'm a cop.
114	00:10:33	00:10:36	I'm CSI Willows here to process you.
115	00:10:36	00:10:38	Get up.
116	00:10:43	00:10:45	Step on the paper.
117	00:10:45	00:10:47	Strip.
118	00:10:47	00:10:49	Just pretend she's an eight-year-old girl.
119	00:11:01	00:11:03	Pants next.
120	00:11:03	00:11:05	Could you close the blinds?
121	00:11:11	00:11:12	Better?
122	00:11:25	00:11:27	Keep going.
123	00:11:33	00:11:35	Three in the van.
124	00:11:35	00:11:36	Still waiting on the mom.
125	00:11:36	00:11:37	Thanks, David.
126	00:11:39	00:11:42	Any reason you're holding her?
127	00:11:42	00:11:44	I need her in context.
128	00:11:44	00:11:47	There's a lot of blood spatter here.
129	00:11:47	00:11:50	There's a lot of blood in this house, period.
130	00:11:50	00:11:57	All this had to have taken a lot of time. Grandmother was stabbed a dozen times; the father was shot three times.
131	00:12:04	00:12:06	Guy has a knife and a gun.
132	00:12:06	00:12:09	So why does he need the towel bar?
133	00:12:11	00:12:13	You really think one person could've done all this?
134	00:12:19	00:12:23	Cadets are outside beating the bushes looking for the knife and the gun.
135	00:12:23	00:12:25	They're having the same luck that we did.
136	00:12:25	00:12:28	I've seen this freezer before.
137	00:12:28	00:12:36	My wife and I once went away for a weekend, and we left our eldest in charge, God help us, so the kids did all the shopping.
138	00:12:36	00:12:39	When we came back, the freezer looked just like this.
139	00:12:39	00:12:41	Popsicles, ice cream.
140	00:12:41	00:12:43	It's a great way to lure a kid.
141	00:12:43	00:12:46	Yeah. You know, not a lure, more like a...
142	00:12:46	00:12:49	a lifestyle.
143	00:12:49	00:12:54	Arrested development. You think John Lee likes little girls because he's a little boy?
144	00:12:54	00:12:56	Immature, isolated.
145	00:12:56	00:12:59	You know, he hides, takes pictures through windows.
146	00:12:59	00:13:00	I'm passive; I'm not aggressive.
147	00:13:00	00:13:04	I thought you liked to play dead, get into the head of the victim.
148	00:13:04	00:13:07	You know, it depends-- you know, you walk into a room, the victim, suspect.
149	00:13:07	00:13:09	I go with whoever has the best story to tell.
150	00:13:09	00:13:11	What story is this guy telling you?
151	00:13:11	00:13:13	I don't know yet.
152	00:13:13	00:13:19	But I'm not so sure that it ends in a quadruple homicide. Oh, whoa, you don't think the man-boy did it?
153	00:13:19	00:13:27	He was in their house, he... was holding the little girl's nightgown, he watched her for years. Yeah, exactly.
154	00:13:27	00:13:28	For years. Thank you, yeah.
155	00:13:28	00:13:32	And all of a sudden one night he stops watching and he starts killing?
156	00:13:32	00:13:35	Why?
157	00:13:36	00:13:38	Right hand.
158	00:13:39	00:13:41	Is it gonna hurt?
159	00:13:41	00:13:44	A lot less than jabbing a towel bar into a woman 20 times.
160	00:13:44	00:13:46	I didn't do it.
161	00:13:46	00:13:48	Any of it.
162	00:13:48	00:13:50	I went by the house.
163	00:13:50	00:13:52	I looked in and I saw her.
164	00:13:52	00:13:53	She was already dead.
165	00:13:53	00:13:56	The blood.
166	00:13:57	00:13:59	I loved her.
167	00:13:59	00:14:01	I couldn't leave her there like that.
168	00:14:01	00:14:05	You know, I ran you-- you had no record, no complaints.
169	00:14:05	00:14:07	But here's what I think happened.
170	00:14:07	00:14:14	I think you were hanging out by that window peeping, and someone saw you, told the Chamblisses-- Dad didn't like that.
171	00:14:14	00:14:20	So he walked across the street to your house, knocked on your door, then knocked on your head.
172	00:14:20	00:14:25	And you didn't like that. I tested your hands for lead to determine if you fired a gun.
173	00:14:25	00:14:28	And guess what color positive is?
174	00:14:30	00:14:33	You shot that little girl.
175	00:14:33	00:14:39	You shot her father, sliced and diced her grandmother, and stabbed and beat her mother with a towel bar.
176	00:14:39	00:14:41	And we're gonna prove it, too.
177	00:14:41	00:14:54	So you got a choice-- you can spend the rest of your life in general pop with a bunch of gangsters and killers who never get to see their kids, they're gonna take it out on you in a heavy way, or you can tell us what you did...
178	00:14:54	00:14:57	and maybe buy yourself a private cell-- what's it gonna be?
179	00:14:57	00:14:59	I did it.
180	00:15:02	00:15:05	I'm the one who killed the Chambliss family.
181	00:15:07	00:15:09	Good afternoon.
182	00:15:09	00:15:13	I'm Undersheriff Ecklie of the Los Vegas Police Department.
183	00:15:13	00:15:22	I'm here to announce that, thanks to the fine efforts of our detectives and CSI's, we have a suspect in custody who has confessed to the murders of the Chambliss family.
184	00:15:22	00:15:25	Can you tell us his name? Why did he do it? How did he it?
185	00:15:25	00:15:27	I have no further comment at this time.
186	00:15:27	00:15:29	Why can't you tell us? One last question.
187	00:15:29	00:15:31	Hey, thanks. Nice job.
188	00:15:31	00:15:33	Yeah.
189	00:15:35	00:15:37	I am saying there has been a mistake.
190	00:15:37	00:15:39	I saw the news-- that sheriff...
191	00:15:39	00:15:41	Ma'am, slow... down.
192	00:15:41	00:15:43	Don't patronize me.
193	00:15:43	00:15:45	I have information about the Chambliss murders.
194	00:15:45	00:15:47	I need to talk to somebody in charge.
195	00:15:47	00:15:51	That would be Captain Brass. You arrested Really?
196	00:15:51	00:15:52	And you would know that how?
197	00:15:54	00:15:56	I know because I did it.
198	00:15:58	00:16:01	I'm the one who killed the Chambliss family.
199	00:16:15	00:16:17	So...
200	00:16:17	00:16:18	Leslie, uh...
201	00:16:18	00:16:19	Gitig.
202	00:16:19	00:16:21	Leslie Gitig.
203	00:16:21	00:16:22	G-I-T-I-G.
204	00:16:22	00:16:27	People always get it wrong. Well, we're gonna get everything right today, Leslie.
205	00:16:27	00:16:30	How do you know the Chambliss family?
206	00:16:30	00:16:34	Calvin Chambliss and I were having an affair.
207	00:16:34	00:16:37	He promised he'd leave his wife Susan for me.
208	00:16:37	00:16:39	I guess that didn't work out.
209	00:16:39	00:16:40	He caved.
210	00:16:40	00:16:42	He told Susan about me.
211	00:16:42	00:16:43	(laughs softly) Bitch.
212	00:16:43	00:16:45	And then he stopped calling.
213	00:16:45	00:16:48	You can check my phone records.
214	00:16:48	00:16:55	So, where were you 00 and midnight? Where I always am-- parked outside their house.
215	00:16:55	00:16:57	You can check the traffic cameras.
216	00:16:57	00:17:01	Oh, and I stopped for gas.
217	00:17:01	00:17:02	So you got out of your car? Yes.
218	00:17:02	00:17:05	Then what? I rang the doorbell.
219	00:17:05	00:17:06	Cal's mother, Anita, answered the door.
220	00:17:06	00:17:08	I told her I was there to see Cal.
221	00:17:08	00:17:10	She wouldn't let me in, so I killed her.
222	00:17:10	00:17:13	And then I killed Cal...
223	00:17:13	00:17:15	and Susan...
224	00:17:15	00:17:16	and Fiona.
225	00:17:16	00:17:18	Yeah, I read the paper, too.
226	00:17:18	00:17:20	Tell us something the whole world doesn't know, Ms. Guy-tig.
227	00:17:20	00:17:22	Gitig.
228	00:17:25	00:17:28	You mean like Anita's throat was slashed.
229	00:17:30	00:17:34	Cal was shot twice in the chest, once between the eyes.
230	00:17:34	00:17:38	And Susan was stabbed repeatedly.
231	00:17:41	00:17:44	Oh, and little Fiona...
232	00:17:45	00:17:47	...was shot in the head.
233	00:17:50	00:17:52	So, you said you entered the house through the front door?
234	00:17:52	00:17:56	If you want to videotape this, I can start again from the beginning.
235	00:18:05	00:18:07	I heard about the second confession.
236	00:18:09	00:18:11	One is good; two is bad.
237	00:18:11	00:18:16	Nut job or not, she's just made things a lot more difficult for us, creating reasonable doubt.
238	00:18:16	00:18:18	So...
239	00:18:18	00:18:20	where would you like to start?
240	00:18:20	00:18:21	Let's start with Mom.
241	00:18:24	00:18:26	Susan Chambliss.
242	00:18:26	00:18:27	Massive head trauma.
243	00:18:27	00:18:29	Exsanguination.
244	00:18:29	00:18:34	24 sharp-force injuries consistent with the jagged ends of the towel bar.
245	00:18:34	00:18:40	15 accompanying blunt-force injuries consistent with its rounded sides.
246	00:18:40	00:18:42	Beaten and stabbed to death.
247	00:18:42	00:18:45	39 blows.
248	00:18:45	00:18:47	Towel bar ripped from the wall.
249	00:18:47	00:18:49	Rage. Yeah.
250	00:18:49	00:18:52	Dear old Dad's a different story.
251	00:18:52	00:18:55	Two gunshot wounds to the chest, and a coup de grâce.
252	00:18:55	00:18:58	David found these blue fibers on Dad's clothing.
253	00:18:58	00:19:01	Could be the shooter.
254	00:19:01	00:19:05	Contact wound right through the frontal bone, execution style.
255	00:19:05	00:19:07	Clean and quick.
256	00:19:07	00:19:09	Rounds look like nine-mill.
257	00:19:09	00:19:11	Same as little girl.
258	00:19:13	00:19:14	I'm not sure I want to hear this, but...
259	00:19:14	00:19:16	sexual assault?
260	00:19:16	00:19:18	There was nothing.
261	00:19:18	00:19:22	No physical findings of any sexual abuse.
262	00:19:22	00:19:27	He escalates to murder but leaves the object of his perversion untouched?
263	00:19:27	00:19:28	Then he just kills her?
264	00:19:28	00:19:30	Doesn't make sense.
265	00:19:31	00:19:33	Hey.
266	00:19:33	00:19:35	Good first day?
267	00:19:35	00:19:36	Yeah.
268	00:19:36	00:19:39	Finished processing outside, and I'm starting on the blood inside.
269	00:19:39	00:19:40	Great, great. Walk with me.
270	00:19:40	00:19:41	Family meeting.
271	00:19:41	00:19:43	Everybody. Let's go.
272	00:19:44	00:19:46	Is he for real?
273	00:19:50	00:19:52	Hey, looks good, Greg.
274	00:19:52	00:19:54	Okay.
275	00:19:54	00:19:57	So, this is how I like to run a family meeting.
276	00:19:57	00:19:59	Clarify the problem first, okay?
277	00:19:59	00:20:02	And we have two competing stories in this case.
278	00:20:02	00:20:05	Who thinks that, uh, the target of this attack was the little girl?
279	00:20:05	00:20:07	Raise your hands.
280	00:20:07	00:20:08	Okay.
281	00:20:08	00:20:10	Never mind. Point of entry.
282	00:20:10	00:20:11	The window?
283	00:20:13	00:20:15	All right, okay, all right.
284	00:20:15	00:20:17	Here comes the birdbath. Smash!
285	00:20:17	00:20:18	What's the little girl do?
286	00:20:18	00:20:21	I, uh, found a puddle of urine under the bed.
287	00:20:21	00:20:23	She must have hid there. All right.
288	00:20:23	00:20:25	Nick, you processed the dad.
289	00:20:25	00:20:26	Could he have heard all of this?
290	00:20:26	00:20:28	Evidence tells me no.
291	00:20:28	00:20:30	He barely got off the sofa before he was shot.
292	00:20:30	00:20:32	TV was on-- he might have been asleep.
293	00:20:32	00:20:35	And Grandma wears a hearing aid, so she probably didn't hear anything.
294	00:20:35	00:20:39	Flour on the kitchen floor indicates Mom was baking a cake.
295	00:20:39	00:20:43	Mixer's on. That's pretty loud. Okay, so maybe nobody hears the window break.
296	00:20:43	00:20:45	But that's crazy.
297	00:20:45	00:20:52	You know, if someone breaks in to my daughter's bedroom, first she yells bloody hell, then she wouldn't hide, she'd run to me. Little girl's behavior is off.
298	00:20:52	00:20:54	Everybody's behavior's off on this thing.
299	00:20:54	00:20:59	Oh, by the way, Catherine called and said John Lee did not touch the girl sexually.
300	00:20:59	00:21:03	So I'm glad to see none of you raised your hands when I asked if she was the source of this whole thing.
301	00:21:03	00:21:08	In that case, I'd like to retract my hand-raise from earlier.
302	00:21:08	00:21:11	Girl's behavior is more consistent with point of entry at the front door.
303	00:21:11	00:21:13	Then she ran and hid.
304	00:21:13	00:21:15	But there was no evidence of forced entry at the front door.
305	00:21:15	00:21:20	Dad's on the sofa, Mom's in the kitchen...
306	00:21:20	00:21:22	and Grandma had to let them in.
307	00:21:22	00:21:27	Grandma was first, Dad was second, Mom was third, stabbed and then dragged into the bathroom.
308	00:21:27	00:21:29	Fiona was last.
309	00:21:29	00:21:31	But if John Lee didn't assault her...
310	00:21:31	00:21:34	Why did he kill her? Well, maybe he didn't, now.
311	00:21:34	00:21:35	Maybe he came in after the killings.
312	00:21:35	00:21:40	He breaks in, throws the birdbath through the window, and then, like he says, he changes her clothes.
313	00:21:40	00:21:44	It would explain why we haven't found any bloody clothes, or a gun, or a knife at his house.
314	00:21:44	00:21:46	Somebody else killed this family.
315	00:21:46	00:21:48	I wore gloves.
316	00:21:48	00:21:50	I always keep a pair in my car.
317	00:21:50	00:21:51	Disposable.
318	00:21:51	00:21:54	Disposable?
319	00:21:54	00:21:58	Where'd you dispose of the gun, the knife, the clothes you wore?
320	00:21:58	00:22:00	I threw them away.
321	00:22:00	00:22:01	Where?
322	00:22:06	00:22:13	I disposed of my Beretta in the water hazard off the 12th hole at the Alsted Country Club.
323	00:22:13	00:22:15	I drive by there every day on my way to the firm.
324	00:22:15	00:22:18	I find it peaceful.
325	00:22:22	00:22:24	Ooh. Is that it?
326	00:22:24	00:22:26	Just like she said.
327	00:22:26	00:22:27	12th hole water hazard.
328	00:22:27	00:22:29	Swan took a bite out of the diver.
329	00:22:29	00:22:32	I'm surprised you let someone else go in after it.
330	00:22:32	00:22:34	You know how those Navy Seals are.
331	00:22:34	00:22:36	They make us Marines take a back seat.
332	00:22:36	00:22:38	Yeah. Well, bullets are in evidence.
333	00:22:38	00:22:40	When you're done, make sure Russell gets your report?
334	00:22:40	00:22:42	Got it.
335	00:22:42	00:22:43	Best job in the world.
336	00:22:43	00:22:45	Get to play with guns.
337	00:22:45	00:22:48	Nobody's shooting back.
338	00:22:48	00:22:49	Print of John Lee's boot.
339	00:22:49	00:22:51	Here you go.
340	00:22:51	00:22:53	Great.
341	00:22:56	00:23:00	Individual characteristics line up.
342	00:23:00	00:23:01	Boots match.
343	00:23:01	00:23:04	Got him at the window.
344	00:23:11	00:23:13	But not in the house.
345	00:23:14	00:23:17	He gained two sizes coming in.
346	00:23:17	00:23:19	Russell was right.
347	00:23:19	00:23:21	Nice hand retraction...
348	00:23:21	00:23:23	brown nose.
349	00:23:31	00:23:34	Fire in the hole.
350	00:24:04	00:24:07	Where are the other gentlemen?
351	00:24:11	00:24:14	If you're going to ask me the questions now, that red light isn't on.
352	00:24:14	00:24:18	You know what a ballistics match is, right?
353	00:24:18	00:24:19	Yes.
354	00:24:19	00:24:24	Well, the gun you had us fish out at the country club was not the murder weapon.
355	00:24:24	00:24:28	The caliber was the same, but the rifling wasn't even close.
356	00:24:28	00:24:36	Wow. As I understand it, any number of things can change a gun's rifling characteristics.
357	00:24:36	00:24:39	Like shoving a screwdriver down the barrel.
358	00:24:41	00:24:43	Are you going back to the lake?
359	00:24:43	00:24:44	Obviously, you found the wrong gun.
360	00:24:44	00:24:46	You...
361	00:24:46	00:24:49	are a...legal secretary, right?
362	00:24:49	00:24:52	You seem like you'd be really good at that job.
363	00:24:52	00:24:55	I mean, you know criminal procedure, you got the lingo down.
364	00:24:55	00:25:02	I bet you even have contacts at PD, or maybe the coroner's office, or the crime lab.
365	00:25:02	00:25:05	I killed that family.
366	00:25:05	00:25:07	Do you want to know why I did it?
367	00:25:07	00:25:11	'Cause that bitch got in the way of me and Cal.
368	00:25:14	00:25:19	Which is why I sunk that knife into her 24 times.
369	00:25:22	00:25:23	I'm sorry.
370	00:25:23	00:25:24	I completely forgot.
371	00:25:24	00:25:27	Um... be right back.
372	00:25:27	00:25:29	Don't-Don't go anywhere, though.
373	00:25:32	00:25:34	Oh, brother, she's a piece of work.
374	00:25:34	00:25:36	And she's, what, like, 105 pounds soaking wet?
375	00:25:36	00:25:38	And I don't think she owns work boots.
376	00:25:38	00:25:40	Not men's size 12, anyway.
377	00:25:40	00:25:43	It was a towel rod, not a knife. I ran her phone logs.
378	00:25:43	00:25:46	She's been making calls to law enforcement all over the county.
379	00:25:46	00:25:48	She got a look at our evidence.
380	00:25:48	00:25:52	You know, she may be crazy, but she figured out point-of-entry before we did.
381	00:25:52	00:25:54	Maybe we should keep that to ourselves. Yeah.
382	00:25:54	00:25:56	John Lee dressed yet?
383	00:25:56	00:25:58	I would hope so. Why? Guy's a peeper.
384	00:25:58	00:26:02	And if he didn't murder that family, maybe he saw who did.
385	00:26:08	00:26:14	So, John, we know you were in the house that night, in Fiona's room.
386	00:26:14	00:26:16	Now you said that... that she was already dead.
387	00:26:16	00:26:19	Let's say we believe your first version.
388	00:26:19	00:26:21	You were still there.
389	00:26:21	00:26:23	Did you see anything?
390	00:26:23	00:26:24	Oh.
391	00:26:24	00:26:27	Well, maybe not the night of the murders, but come on, buddy.
392	00:26:27	00:26:29	You've been watching that family for years.
393	00:26:29	00:26:31	You trying to trick me?
394	00:26:31	00:26:36	No. No, no, no, no. John, you loved Fiona.
395	00:26:36	00:26:38	Loved her.
396	00:26:38	00:26:39	And something horrible happened to her.
397	00:26:39	00:26:41	She would want you to help us.
398	00:26:49	00:26:51	Have you ever seen this woman?
399	00:26:53	00:26:55	Red BMW.
400	00:26:55	00:26:57	Three Series.
401	00:26:57	00:26:59	She would park down the street and just sit there.
402	00:27:01	00:27:03	She's an awful woman.
403	00:27:03	00:27:04	How do you know?
404	00:27:04	00:27:06	You can just tell sometimes.
405	00:27:06	00:27:10	Did this awful woman ever go inside?
406	00:27:16	00:27:18	Did you ever see any other awful people go inside?
407	00:27:20	00:27:23	Can I have that cherry cola now?
408	00:27:28	00:27:30	Explain this to me.
409	00:27:30	00:27:35	Some perv stalks your daughter, peeks in her window, takes photos for years.
410	00:27:35	00:27:38	Mother doesn't work; father is unemployed.
411	00:27:38	00:27:40	I mean, they were around.
412	00:27:40	00:27:41	You can't tell me they didn't know.
413	00:27:41	00:27:44	I found dozens of footprints outside that window.
414	00:27:44	00:27:47	So why didn't they call the police?
415	00:27:47	00:27:48	Maybe they couldn't.
416	00:27:50	00:27:51	Did you get a look inside that garage?
417	00:27:51	00:27:54	Porsche still has dealer plates, new Volvo wagon.
418	00:27:54	00:27:55	Money.
419	00:27:55	00:27:56	Dad was laid off.
420	00:27:56	00:27:58	Where'd it come from?
421	00:27:58	00:28:02	In L.A., at least 70% of all murders are related to drugs.
422	00:28:02	00:28:04	Well, that might explain what I recovered from the kitchen.
423	00:28:04	00:28:08	Finally got a chance to process everything.
424	00:28:08	00:28:11	I don't think Mom was just baking cakes.
425	00:28:11	00:28:13	That is a lot of baking soda.
426	00:28:13	00:28:17	And one seriously accurate scale.
427	00:28:17	00:28:22	Either mom was OCD, or she was cutting powder. Cocaine?
428	00:28:22	00:28:23	Maybe meth.
429	00:28:23	00:28:25	Well, we didn't find any drugs in that house.
430	00:28:25	00:28:26	Because we weren't looking for them.
431	00:28:28	00:28:29	I'll drive.
432	00:28:29	00:28:31	I know the way.
433	00:28:36	00:28:38	What are you doing?
434	00:28:38	00:28:41	(gasps) My hand looks like Gorbachev's head.
435	00:28:41	00:28:44	I was out in the field whacking the weeds for weaponry...
436	00:28:44	00:28:46	You know better than to handle evidence without gloves.
437	00:28:46	00:28:48	...when I dropped my gloves.
438	00:28:48	00:28:52	And when I went down to pick them up, I put my hand in some very un-eco-friendly battery acid.
439	00:28:52	00:28:54	Why'd you drop your gloves?
440	00:28:54	00:28:57	You know, they really shouldn't even let you out of the lab.
441	00:28:57	00:28:59	May I cite you in my Workmen's Comp case?
442	00:28:59	00:29:04	How about citing your results from the blue fibers Super Dave found on Mr. Chambliss, instead?
443	00:29:04	00:29:06	Lucky for you, I can work through the pain.
444	00:29:08	00:29:11	Your blue fibers-- denim.
445	00:29:11	00:29:13	Of the phylum Levis.
446	00:29:13	00:29:15	So jeans. Almost.
447	00:29:15	00:29:21	Just as you'll never get the chance to run Grave, these never got the chance to be pants.
448	00:29:21	00:29:23	How much pain do you want to have to work through, Hodges?
449	00:29:23	00:29:25	Please turn to page two.
450	00:29:26	00:29:30	The fibers were saturated in borate-- fire retardant.
451	00:29:30	00:29:35	Jean companies will pulp their cutting-room scraps and sell them for insulating materials.
452	00:29:35	00:29:37	Which is used in green construction.
453	00:29:37	00:29:39	So how does insulation end up on Dad?
454	00:29:39	00:29:41	Well, maybe he was doing some sort of home improvement?
455	00:29:41	00:29:44	Or maybe the killer works construction.
456	00:29:46	00:29:48	You don't have to be mean about it.
457	00:30:02	00:30:04	Morgan, Greg, get in here.
458	00:30:09	00:30:13	This is the exact layout of John Lee's bedroom, except he didn't have one of these.
459	00:30:13	00:30:15	Yeah, and the electrical panel's in the garage.
460	00:30:24	00:30:26	Good call, Hollywood.
461	00:30:26	00:30:28	I love it when I'm right.
462	00:30:28	00:30:31	We searched the house, John.
463	00:30:31	00:30:32	We know about the drugs.
464	00:30:32	00:30:36	So these awful people that went into the house-- is-is that what they came for?
465	00:30:36	00:30:39	They let strange men sit on her bed.
466	00:30:39	00:30:41	Made her sit out in the hallway.
467	00:30:41	00:30:45	One time, she forgot her doll.
468	00:30:45	00:30:47	Tried to come back in and get it.
469	00:30:47	00:30:50	Her dad yelled at her.
470	00:30:50	00:30:51	She cried.
471	00:30:53	00:30:55	He yelled a lot.
472	00:30:55	00:30:57	Did he ever yell at anybody else?
473	00:31:20	00:31:24	Got a hit-- multiple arrests for drug possession.
474	00:31:25	00:31:27	Lonny Gallows.
475	00:31:27	00:31:29	John, you saw something happen in that house.
476	00:31:29	00:31:32	You saw someone arguing with Fiona's dad.
477	00:31:32	00:31:35	Who?
478	00:31:40	00:31:43	John, is this the guy?
479	00:31:45	00:31:49	Hey! Did you ever see this man, John?
480	00:31:51	00:31:53	Yes.
481	00:31:53	00:31:55	In Fiona's bedroom?
482	00:31:55	00:31:57	Yes.
483	00:31:59	00:32:01	Yes, a lot.
484	00:32:04	00:32:05	Lonny Gallows?!
485	00:32:12	00:32:14	(grunts) Get out of here.
486	00:32:14	00:32:16	Where you going, dude? Yo, I didn't do nothing!
487	00:32:16	00:32:18	Yeah, pat him down good, Mitch.
488	00:32:19	00:32:24	(Lonny sighs) Lonny, this looks bad.
489	00:32:24	00:32:26	Yeah, this looks worse.
490	00:32:26	00:32:28	Lonny Gallows, you're under arrest.
491	00:32:28	00:32:31	Possession for sales of a controlled substance.
492	00:32:31	00:32:33	Well, you're in a lot more trouble than that, bud.
493	00:32:33	00:32:36	Hey, what are you doing with my son?
494	00:32:36	00:32:37	Arresting him for murder.
495	00:32:37	00:32:39	My son didn't kill anyone.
496	00:32:39	00:32:44	Sir, stay out of this now. You don't want to interfere with a police investigation.
497	00:32:44	00:32:46	Those boots are mine.
498	00:32:46	00:32:48	So are the gloves.
499	00:32:48	00:32:51	Arrest me. I did it.
500	00:32:51	00:32:53	I'm the one who killed the Chambliss family.
501	00:32:53	00:32:54	You got to be kidding me.
502	00:33:03	00:33:05	You understand lying to a police officer is a crime.
503	00:33:05	00:33:08	I'm not lying. Really?
504	00:33:08	00:33:09	I got your file.
505	00:33:09	00:33:13	You know, Mr. Gallows, you've never done anything wrong in your life.
506	00:33:13	00:33:17	You're a family man, you own your own business, you're doing well.
507	00:33:17	00:33:19	You're the only guy in construction that I know who's making money.
508	00:33:19	00:33:21	Then you massacre a family?
509	00:33:21	00:33:23	I want to make a deal.
510	00:33:23	00:33:25	I'm not making a deal with you because I don't believe you.
511	00:33:25	00:33:28	I did it. Listen, listen, we know your son's a drug addict.
512	00:33:28	00:33:33	He was high when we busted him and it's pretty safe to assume he was high a couple of nights ago when he committed these crimes.
513	00:33:33	00:33:39	We found his prints all over the cash and drugs in the Chambliss house. That's how we know he was running drugs for Cal Chambliss.
514	00:33:39	00:33:42	I get it-- you want to protect your kid.
515	00:33:42	00:33:44	I did protect my kid by killing that family.
516	00:33:46	00:33:48	Lonny got clean in rehab.
517	00:33:48	00:33:54	I tried to keep him clean, I put him on my crew building green houses-- same damn houses in Cal Chambliss' neighborhood.
518	00:33:54	00:33:56	So that's how they met.
519	00:33:56	00:33:59	It's my fault, my mistake.
520	00:33:59	00:34:01	Here's how I correct it.
521	00:34:01	00:34:04	You drop the drug charges on Lonny...
522	00:34:04	00:34:08	and I'll tell you everything.
523	00:34:08	00:34:18	Well, thanks to Maurice Gallows' confession, Leslie Gitig just got sprung, and our perv John Lee just made bail.
524	00:34:18	00:34:19	I'm telling you, it pays to have rich parents.
525	00:34:19	00:34:21	I don't see the dad doing it.
526	00:34:21	00:34:24	No, no, man, he's taking the rap for his son.
527	00:34:24	00:34:30	Okay, so Lonny's dealing drugs for Chambliss, gets hooked, starts dipping into his boss' supply.
528	00:34:30	00:34:32	Cal cuts him off, and Lonny just decides to gets even.
529	00:34:32	00:34:37	Great, so our only viable suspect is the one person who hasn't confessed to the crime.
530	00:34:43	00:34:46	Any thoughts?
531	00:34:46	00:34:48	Yeah.
532	00:34:48	00:34:50	Who killed Cock Robin?
533	00:34:52	00:34:54	Those shrooms in your office aren't medicinal, are they?
534	00:34:54	00:34:56	I, said the Sparrow.
535	00:34:56	00:34:59	With my bow and arrow, I killed Cock Robin.
536	00:34:59	00:35:00	Who saw him die?
537	00:35:00	00:35:01	I, said the Fly.
538	00:35:01	00:35:04	With my little eye, I saw him die.
539	00:35:04	00:35:06	I, said the Fish, I, said...
540	00:35:06	00:35:07	Oh, come on.
541	00:35:07	00:35:08	All right, forget folk songs.
542	00:35:08	00:35:10	Uh, crime novels.
543	00:35:10	00:35:12	Yeah, I saw the movie.
544	00:35:12	00:35:14	What's, what's your point?
545	00:35:14	00:35:15	The p... (sighs)
546	00:35:15	00:35:17	Nick, when you were hooking up Lonny, what did his father say-- exact words?
547	00:35:17	00:35:21	He said, I did it, I'm the one who killed the Chambliss family.
548	00:35:21	00:35:27	I, said John Lee, I did it, I'm the one who killed the Chambliss family.
549	00:35:27	00:35:32	I, said Leslie Gitig, I did it, I'm the one who killed the Chambliss family.
550	00:35:32	00:35:35	Now, that's three confessions, all identical.
551	00:35:35	00:35:38	Hell of a coincidence. So it's like they got their stories straight.
552	00:35:38	00:35:39	They were working together.
553	00:35:39	00:35:40	Strangers on a Train.
554	00:35:40	00:35:44	Total strangers get together to commit a crime, figuring the cops won't make the connection.
555	00:35:44	00:35:47	And each one of them had motive to do harm to someone in that family.
556	00:35:47	00:35:50	And each had reason to confess.
557	00:35:50	00:35:51	By all confessing, they muddied the water.
558	00:35:51	00:35:56	There is no perfect crime, but if you create enough reasonable doubt, you might just have the perfect defense.
559	00:35:56	00:35:58	And that's something a legal secretary would know.
560	00:35:58	00:36:01	Now, how do we get around reasonable doubt?
561	00:36:03	00:36:04	Find the train.
562	00:36:07	00:36:09	All right, thank you.
563	00:36:11	00:36:13	So I just spoke with the owner of Benson's Auto Body.
564	00:36:13	00:36:17	Two weeks ago, Leslie Gitig paid him $4,500.
565	00:36:17	00:36:18	Benson's Auto Body?
566	00:36:18	00:36:20	That's where John Lee works.
567	00:36:20	00:36:21	Could be where they met.
568	00:36:21	00:36:26	Leslie's BMW was in an accident and she didn't want to run it through her insurance.
569	00:36:26	00:36:29	She paid cash, but not just for her repair but for the truck that she plowed into.
570	00:36:29	00:36:30	Truck, what kind of truck?
571	00:36:30	00:36:33	I don't know, the driver hasn't brought it in yet.
572	00:36:33	00:36:35	Maybe 'cause he needed it for work.
573	00:36:35	00:36:39	I saw a couple of thousand dollars worth of damage to Maurice Gallows' truck.
574	00:36:39	00:36:46	All right, well, sounds like we need to take a look at that truck, compare the damage to Leslie's car.
575	00:36:46	00:36:47	I'll take the truck.
576	00:36:47	00:36:49	Greg and I'll take the Beemer.
577	00:36:51	00:36:55	Victor 2-4, Victor 2-4. Come in.
578	00:36:55	00:36:57	Nice job matching the color.
579	00:36:57	00:36:59	Well, yeah, to the naked eye anyway.
580	00:37:06	00:37:08	Yep, left-side damage.
581	00:37:08	00:37:10	I'll call for a warrant.
582	00:37:11	00:37:13	3-David-34.
583	00:37:13	00:37:15	Shots fired. Request backup at our location.
584	00:37:15	00:37:18	2-David-3-4, copy that. 4-34 call.
585	00:37:28	00:37:29	We got one down.
586	00:37:42	00:37:47	We need rescue at 10923 Cartland Avenue.
587	00:37:47	00:37:49	Put the gun down!
588	00:37:49	00:37:50	Put the gun down! Now!
589	00:37:50	00:37:51	Stay with her.
590	00:37:51	00:37:53	Drop the gun.
591	00:37:53	00:37:54	John...
592	00:37:54	00:37:56	please...
593	00:37:56	00:37:58	do what he says.
594	00:37:58	00:37:59	Put down the gun.
595	00:38:00	00:38:03	They made me go there.
596	00:38:03	00:38:04	She made me.
597	00:38:04	00:38:06	Leslie?
598	00:38:06	00:38:11	She said I could have her, but she didn't tell me what we had to do.
599	00:38:11	00:38:15	And then the screaming started.
600	00:38:16	00:38:23	The shooting-- it was so loud and there was blood.
601	00:38:23	00:38:25	There was so much blood.
602	00:38:25	00:38:26	John, we can talk about this.
603	00:38:26	00:38:28	You've got to put the gun down.
604	00:38:28	00:38:30	She said Fiona had to die.
605	00:38:30	00:38:32	She gave me her gun...
606	00:38:32	00:38:35	this gun.
607	00:38:35	00:38:36	(screams) Oh, shut up!
608	00:38:36	00:38:38	I just couldn't do it. Give me that.
609	00:38:38	00:38:39	No, no!
610	00:38:41	00:38:43	She was so beautiful.
611	00:38:43	00:38:50	I didn't want to remember her like that, so I came back afterward.
612	00:38:56	00:38:59	That awful woman.
613	00:38:59	00:39:04	Sh-She took my Fiona away from me.
614	00:39:05	00:39:10	Now... I have nothing.
615	00:39:15	00:39:18	We found the murder weapons at Leslie Gitig's house.
616	00:39:18	00:39:21	Knife, gun-- the real one.
617	00:39:21	00:39:24	I killed Chambliss and his family, like I said.
618	00:39:24	00:39:30	Well, it's a good story, but this gun tells a better one.
619	00:39:30	00:39:32	Maurice, your son did it.
620	00:39:32	00:39:38	The gun goes back to him, so unless you make us understand what really happened, Lonny's going to get the needle.
621	00:39:39	00:39:43	This is crazy, you know, I...
622	00:39:43	00:39:45	I'd blame Leslie.
623	00:39:45	00:39:47	It wasn't like she hit your truck by accident.
624	00:39:47	00:39:50	That's just the beginning of the damage she did to you and your family.
625	00:39:50	00:39:53	There are no accidents, right?
626	00:39:53	00:39:59	A woman scorned parks outside her ex-lover's house night after night, thinking about how to destroy him?
627	00:39:59	00:40:02	What does she see?
628	00:40:02	00:40:04	A pedophile lusting after a little girl...
629	00:40:04	00:40:09	Stop pushing drugs on my son or I swear I will kill you. ...and a father fighting for his son. You and your whole family!
630	00:40:09	00:40:12	Three strangers who all want something.
631	00:40:12	00:40:14	They just need to meet.
632	00:40:16	00:40:22	I did everything I could to get Lonny clean, and it was working.
633	00:40:22	00:40:24	Then he met Cal, and I was losing him again.
634	00:40:28	00:40:31	She swore it was just going to be Cal.
635	00:40:31	00:40:33	Cal's expecting me.
636	00:40:33	00:40:34	She lied.
637	00:40:39	00:40:41	What are you waiting for?
638	00:40:41	00:40:45	Once I stepped into that house, I had no choice.
639	00:40:49	00:40:50	Run!
640	00:40:50	00:40:52	No!
641	00:40:53	00:40:55	(gasps) You bitch!
642	00:41:07	00:41:09	(Fiona screaming) Give me that.
643	00:41:09	00:41:10	No, no!
644	00:41:13	00:41:21	You know what it's like to lose a kid to drugs, to wish the world for 'em and see that world come crashing down around 'em?
645	00:41:23	00:41:26	I do, actually.
646	00:41:29	00:41:31	I do.
647	00:41:31	00:41:35	But it still doesn't justify killing a whole family.
648	00:41:50	00:41:51	I'm going to head out.
649	00:41:51	00:41:52	You need anything?
650	00:41:52	00:41:55	No, I'm good, thank you.
651	00:41:55	00:41:57	I'll see you tomorrow.
652	00:42:02	00:42:03	Cock Robin.
653	00:42:03	00:42:05	Really? (chuckles)
654	00:42:05	00:42:08	What journal did you get that one from?
655	00:42:08	00:42:14	My parents were singers, and that was kind of a favorite around our, our van.
656	00:42:14	00:42:15	Oh.
657	00:42:15	00:42:17	Go with what you know, right?
658	00:42:17	00:42:19	Yeah.
659	00:42:19	00:42:21	Well, it worked, it really worked.
660	00:42:22	00:42:24	What's going on?
661	00:42:24	00:42:25	Are you all right?
662	00:42:33	00:42:34	Aren't you going to get that?
663	00:42:34	00:42:36	I don't want to be rude.
664	00:42:36	00:42:38	Oh, be rude.
665	00:42:38	00:42:39	Good night.
666	00:42:41	00:42:43	Good night.
667	00:42:43	00:42:46	Hey, doll, how are you?
668	00:42:46	00:42:48	Uh, don't worry about it.
669	00:42:48	00:42:50	I-I'll pick something up for us on the way home.
670	00:42:50	00:42:53	Yeah, hey, hey, wait, how, how did Charlie do in practice?
