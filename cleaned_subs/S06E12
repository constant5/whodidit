0	00:00:46	00:00:47	Hey, lady.
1	00:00:47	00:00:49	Hey.
2	00:00:49	00:00:53	I can't sleep.
3	00:00:53	00:00:55	You want to try to eat something?
4	00:00:55	00:00:57	Yeah.
5	00:01:02	00:01:03	All right.
6	00:01:03	00:01:05	I'll go get him.
7	00:01:05	00:01:06	You get dressed.
8	00:01:08	00:01:10	Ahren?
9	00:01:13	00:01:14	Ahren?
10	00:01:17	00:01:18	Ahren?
11	00:01:22	00:01:23	Ahren...
12	00:01:26	00:01:28	Ahren...
13	00:01:30	00:01:32	Ahren...
14	00:01:33	00:01:39	Okay, Ahren Green, 29 years old, lives here with Bianca Desmond, that's the brunette.
15	00:01:40	00:01:42	The blonde is Chelsea Wannamaker.
16	00:01:42	00:01:44	She was just spending the night.
17	00:01:44	00:01:46	One was asleep, one was in the bathroom.
18	00:01:46	00:01:48	They said Ahren was probably working on his bike.
19	00:01:51	00:01:52	His pupils are dilated.
20	00:01:52	00:01:54	Lividity is consistent with body position.
21	00:01:54	00:01:59	Looks like he bled out from a stab wound to his upper leg or pelvic area.
22	00:01:59	00:02:03	Well, in my experience, I found that most threesomes end up being one too many.
23	00:02:03	00:02:06	So, David, uh...
24	00:02:06	00:02:09	check and make sure that they didn't pull a Lorena Bobbitt.
25	00:02:10	00:02:11	Take a look.
26	00:02:19	00:02:20	No, we're good.
27	00:02:20	00:02:21	My man's all there.
28	00:02:21	00:02:23	We're...good.
29	00:02:23	00:02:24	Something must be wrong his gear.
30	00:02:24	00:02:29	He could be partying with two hot chicks inside, but he's out here working on his bike 00 in the morning?
31	00:02:29	00:02:31	Maybe he wasn't invited.
32	00:03:06	00:03:09	Hold out your hands, please.
33	00:03:10	00:03:13	And the other side.
34	00:03:17	00:03:20	What were you doing right before Ahren was killed?
35	00:03:20	00:03:23	Cleaning.
36	00:03:23	00:03:24	With what?
37	00:03:24	00:03:26	Bleach.
38	00:03:26	00:03:28	It's the only thing that works.
39	00:03:28	00:03:29	Okay.
40	00:03:29	00:03:32	You know, you could put some clothes on if you want, if you're cold.
41	00:03:32	00:03:34	She won't let me back in my room.
42	00:04:08	00:04:10	Man, I give this guy an A for organization.
43	00:04:10	00:04:13	He's got a spot for everything.
44	00:04:13	00:04:14	Why is that helmet over there?
45	00:04:15	00:04:18	Maybe he threw it, defending himself.
46	00:04:26	00:04:28	Yeah, but he looked like he was in pretty good shape.
47	00:04:28	00:04:31	It'd be kind of hard for one of those women to wrestle him down.
48	00:04:31	00:04:34	Not if she walks softly and carried a big knife.
49	00:04:34	00:04:36	How long have you known Ahren?
50	00:04:36	00:04:38	Six months.
51	00:04:39	00:04:42	Did, uh, did he have any enemies that you know of?
52	00:04:42	00:04:46	No, I mean... I don't know.
53	00:04:46	00:04:47	You don't know...
54	00:04:47	00:04:48	I mean, you two lived together right?
55	00:04:48	00:04:51	Yeah, but we were still getting to know each other.
56	00:04:52	00:04:52	I see.
57	00:04:53	00:04:54	We met one night at Light.
58	00:04:54	00:04:58	He was in town for a motocross race.
59	00:04:58	00:05:00	It was love at first sight.
60	00:05:00	00:05:06	I asked him to come back here, and he never left.
61	00:05:06	00:05:11	We actually just decided tonight to move to Colorado together.
62	00:05:11	00:05:12	What, just pick up and leave all this?
63	00:05:12	00:05:16	My father has a cabin where we could stay.
64	00:05:16	00:05:17	Did Ahren have a job?
65	00:05:17	00:05:19	Yeah. Motocross racing. Right.
66	00:05:20	00:05:21	You said that.
67	00:05:21	00:05:22	He's a professional athlete.
68	00:05:22	00:05:24	And you, what about you? What do you do?
69	00:05:24	00:05:25	I'm in fashion.
70	00:05:25	00:05:27	Mm-hm.
71	00:05:29	00:05:30	What's the matter?
72	00:05:33	00:05:35	I have the worst luck with men.
73	00:05:35	00:05:38	What do you mean?
74	00:05:38	00:05:44	They're either jerks or they leave me, or they get killed.
75	00:05:47	00:05:49	What's wrong with me?
76	00:05:53	00:05:55	What do you got?
77	00:05:55	00:05:59	Well, I wasn't sure if I should call it in as a 419 or a 401A.
78	00:05:59	00:06:01	Hit and run?
79	00:06:01	00:06:03	You tell me.
80	00:06:03	00:06:06	Mm, I don't know.
81	00:06:06	00:06:08	When you run, you usually take the car.
82	00:06:09	00:06:10	The vic's Sylvia Mullins.
83	00:06:10	00:06:12	Works in one of the offices upstairs.
84	00:06:12	00:06:15	The security guard found her.
85	00:06:15	00:06:17	Did you run the plates?
86	00:06:17	00:06:18	That's why I went with the 419.
87	00:06:19	00:06:20	R.O.'s the vic.
88	00:06:27	00:06:31	Hit with her own car in her own spot.
89	00:06:31	00:06:34	Ms. Mullins must have been working all night.
90	00:06:34	00:06:35	You know, tax season.
91	00:06:35	00:06:36	She's an accountant?
92	00:06:36	00:06:39	Has her own firm up on 11.
93	00:06:40	00:06:43	Did you see anything on your monitors?
94	00:06:45	00:06:47	Uh, no.
95	00:06:47	00:06:48	But I heard the crash.
96	00:06:48	00:06:50	I sort of fell asleep.
97	00:06:50	00:06:53	We're going to need to see your tapes.
98	00:06:53	00:06:58	Cell phone, a shoe and a briefcase.
99	00:06:58	00:07:00	Probably lost them all on impact.
100	00:07:00	00:07:02	Looks like she saw the car coming.
101	00:07:02	00:07:05	Impact's pretty evenly distributed.
102	00:07:05	00:07:07	The car hit her straight on.
103	00:07:07	00:07:11	Most cars have to be going at least 14 miles an hour to trigger the airbag.
104	00:07:15	00:07:19	Well, I can't be sure, but it looks like somebody popped the ignition.
105	00:07:21	00:07:22	Carjacking gone bad?
106	00:07:25	00:07:28	Vic gets off the elevator, walks to her spot...
107	00:07:30	00:07:34	...on the phone, distracted, catches the guy stealing her ride...
108	00:07:47	00:07:50	He runs her over and splits.
109	00:07:50	00:07:52	Pedal to the metal.
110	00:07:59	00:08:01	Hey.
111	00:08:01	00:08:03	ALS is lighting up everywhere.
112	00:08:03	00:08:05	Evidently she bleaches everything.
113	00:08:05	00:08:07	So there could be some false positives.
114	00:08:07	00:08:11	Yeah, including her teeth.
115	00:08:11	00:08:12	Check out the cabinet.
116	00:08:15	00:08:19	Lots of teeth whitener and acne cream.
117	00:08:19	00:08:21	Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
118	00:08:21	00:08:22	Speed freak.
119	00:08:22	00:08:23	Definitely.
120	00:08:24	00:08:29	Maybe she killed Ahren in the garage then came up here to take a Silkwood shower.
121	00:08:35	00:08:41	Okay, but she's claiming she loved him.
122	00:08:41	00:08:42	What's her motive?
123	00:08:42	00:08:56	Uh, we started out at Light and then we went to Road Runner, and from there we were at Double Down, and then Copper K, and then we ended up at Drai's.
124	00:08:56	00:08:58	Drai's, that's a good place to end.
125	00:08:58	00:09:00	So what are you on besides meth?
126	00:09:02	00:09:04	Not meth.
127	00:09:04	00:09:05	Glass.
128	00:09:05	00:09:07	Uh-huh.
129	00:09:08	00:09:11	We did some coke at the club, had a couple of drinks.
130	00:09:11	00:09:17	There was this guy that gave us these, uh, these blue pills, but I had to come home and lie down.
131	00:09:17	00:09:18	Ecstasy.
132	00:09:18	00:09:20	We only do this when we're, when we're clubbing.
133	00:09:20	00:09:24	I mean, it's just a hobby, it's not a habit.
134	00:09:24	00:09:26	We have it under control.
135	00:09:26	00:09:30	Well, the dead guy from the garage might beg to differ.
136	00:09:35	00:09:37	Eww, busy.
137	00:09:37	00:09:44	If Bianca killed him, and then came up here to take a shower, wouldn't she have left a trail?
138	00:09:44	00:09:46	Maybe.
139	00:10:05	00:10:07	It appears she missed a spot.
140	00:11:08	00:11:10	Las Vegas Coroner's Office.
141	00:11:10	00:11:11	David, it's Warrick. Have you washed the body yet?
142	00:11:11	00:11:14	I just got started, but I can be done by the time you get here.
143	00:11:14	00:11:15	No, stop.
144	00:11:15	00:11:18	I uh, just found a bullet.
145	00:11:18	00:11:19	I have no idea who fired it.
146	00:11:19	00:11:25	test his hands for GSR and run it through the flouroscope.
147	00:11:25	00:11:26	No problem.
148	00:11:26	00:11:29	Thanks, David.
149	00:11:29	00:11:32	Who brings a gun to a knife fight?
150	00:11:34	00:11:36	The winner?
151	00:11:38	00:11:39	The killer knew how to steal a car.
152	00:11:39	00:11:40	No prints? No.
153	00:11:40	00:11:43	No, it's wiped clean.
154	00:11:43	00:11:44	Hey, Arch.
155	00:11:44	00:11:46	You get anything off the parking garage camera?
156	00:11:47	00:11:49	Um, sort of.
157	00:11:52	00:11:53	What's up with the focus?
158	00:11:53	00:11:54	That's what I was wondering, too.
159	00:11:55	00:11:58	Check out what happened about an hour earlier.
160	00:12:01	00:12:03	It's an old security cam.
161	00:12:03	00:12:04	Adjustable focus ring.
162	00:12:04	00:12:06	Killer was camera shy.
163	00:12:06	00:12:07	For good reason.
164	00:12:07	00:12:09	This wasn't a carjacking gone bad.
165	00:12:09	00:12:10	It was premeditated.
166	00:12:10	00:12:14	If he touched the camera, maybe I can get some prints off it.
167	00:12:14	00:12:15	Keep working the video, Arch.
168	00:12:15	00:12:17	See if you can get us a face. Yeah.
169	00:12:17	00:12:20	Fluoroscope detected no bullets.
170	00:12:20	00:12:25	But there are peri-mortem bruises on his wrists and forearms, look like defensive wounds.
171	00:12:25	00:12:26	C.O.D.?
172	00:12:26	00:12:29	The weapon went pretty deep. Punctured the femoral artery.
173	00:12:29	00:12:35	I'd say he bled out in a matter of minutes, if his dilated pupils are an indication of amphetamines in his system.
174	00:12:36	00:12:37	The faster the heart rate, the faster the blood pumps.
175	00:12:38	00:12:39	Here, take a look.
176	00:12:40	00:12:42	The fatal blow.
177	00:12:42	00:12:45	Weapon appears to have a triangular shape.
178	00:12:45	00:12:47	Angle of entry was upwards.
179	00:12:47	00:12:50	Like a cornada. I'm sorry.
180	00:12:50	00:12:54	A cornada-- occupational hazard for matadors during a bullfight.
181	00:12:55	00:12:56	The bull rears up and gores them.
182	00:12:56	00:13:00	So just find a bull with a bloody horn, and you've got your killer.
183	00:13:02	00:13:06	So your soda-can killer was a copper-washed .22.
184	00:13:06	00:13:13	Now I could only get general rifling characteristics-- six lands and grooves with a right-hand twist, um, but...
185	00:13:13	00:13:16	But not enough individual characteristics to run it through IBIS.
186	00:13:16	00:13:17	Exactly. Sorry, man.
187	00:13:17	00:13:19	That's all right.
188	00:13:19	00:13:22	Hodges.
189	00:13:22	00:13:25	Your victim did not have GSR on his hands.
190	00:13:25	00:13:29	Okay, what about metallic trace from the garage floor?
191	00:13:29	00:13:36	Thank you, Hodges, for performing that incredibly elaborate test requiring copious concentration and an advanced degree.
192	00:13:36	00:13:40	So you don't have any results from the metallic trace on the garage floor?
193	00:13:40	00:13:42	But I will.
194	00:13:42	00:13:45	That's the beauty of me.
195	00:14:16	00:14:21	Well, Mr. Miller, what I would recommend is adding some tax-deferred investments to your portfolio.
196	00:14:21	00:14:23	Like a ROTH IRA. That's be perfect for you.
197	00:14:23	00:14:25	I never got what that ROTH stood for.
198	00:14:56	00:14:58	Hey, Kelly. Have a seat.
199	00:14:58	00:14:59	Thanks for seeing me.
200	00:14:59	00:15:02	I know you said we didn't have to do this in person.
201	00:15:02	00:15:03	No, I'm really glad you came.
202	00:15:03	00:15:05	Kelly, your father loved you very much.
203	00:15:05	00:15:07	A little too much.
204	00:15:07	00:15:09	I just wanted to talk about his estate.
205	00:15:09	00:15:11	Is what he did going to affect it?
206	00:15:11	00:15:12	Well, it's kind of complicated.
207	00:15:25	00:15:27	District Four, Parole and Probation.
208	00:15:27	00:15:29	Yeah, this is Nick Stokes with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
209	00:15:30	00:15:32	We're trying to reach Kelly Gordon's parole officer.
210	00:15:32	00:15:34	That's me.
211	00:15:34	00:15:37	Great. I need Kelly's contact information.
212	00:15:37	00:15:40	Sure, but I gave her permission to go out of town.
213	00:15:40	00:15:42	Her bus left a couple hours ago.
214	00:15:45	00:15:47	Oh, hey, I'm glad you're here.
215	00:15:47	00:15:49	I got the results back from the blood on Bianca's bedroom floor.
216	00:15:49	00:15:51	The dead guy? Uh, no.
217	00:15:51	00:15:54	It's a male, but it's not a match to Ahren Green.
218	00:15:54	00:15:58	Then I ran it through CODIS and I actually got a hit.
219	00:15:58	00:16:00	Justin Cole.
220	00:16:00	00:16:04	He's in the system for statutory rape a couple years back.
221	00:16:04	00:16:05	Among other things.
222	00:16:09	00:16:11	So, why am I here?
223	00:16:11	00:16:16	What, you getting homesick for the train tracks behind Union Plaza already?
224	00:16:18	00:16:20	Bianca Desmond.
225	00:16:20	00:16:23	Girl's like an oven in there.
226	00:16:23	00:16:26	Used to love it in there.
227	00:16:27	00:16:29	How long ago was that?
228	00:16:29	00:16:32	A few months.
229	00:16:32	00:16:36	Did you stop by recently to check out the competition?
230	00:16:36	00:16:39	No. We lost touch.
231	00:16:39	00:16:43	So it wouldn't bother you to know Bianca's moved on, and she's living with another guy.
232	00:16:43	00:16:45	It was good while it lasted.
233	00:16:45	00:16:47	We found your blood in her bedroom.
234	00:16:48	00:16:49	And her dead boyfriend in the garage.
235	00:16:57	00:16:59	That's funny?
236	00:17:00	00:17:02	Nah.
237	00:17:02	00:17:06	Just... Bianca's all fun and games until someone shoots you in the leg.
238	00:17:06	00:17:07	When was that?
239	00:17:07	00:17:10	Six months ago.
240	00:17:12	00:17:15	Hey, sweetie, I went shopping with my mom.
241	00:17:15	00:17:17	I'll be home late.
242	00:17:17	00:17:19	There's some candy for you on the table.
243	00:17:19	00:17:20	See you then. Love you.
244	00:17:26	00:17:29	Stay away from Bianca.
245	00:17:29	00:17:32	So I packed my stuff and left.
246	00:17:32	00:17:33	Did you report it?
247	00:17:34	00:17:37	Nah. Still on probation for that she-looked-18 incident.
248	00:17:37	00:17:39	This the guy who shot you?
249	00:17:40	00:17:43	Didn't really get a good look.
250	00:17:43	00:17:44	I was too busy bleeding.
251	00:17:45	00:17:46	You go to the hospital?
252	00:17:46	00:17:49	Sort of had my own anesthesia thing going on.
253	00:17:49	00:17:51	So whatever happened to the bullet?
254	00:18:09	00:18:14	Yeah, see, human tissue sticks pretty darn good.
255	00:18:14	00:18:18	And I can't scalpel it off, because I might damage the bullet's characteristics.
256	00:18:18	00:18:21	So, uh... so I guess we wait.
257	00:18:21	00:18:26	Half of these tools don't match the size and the shape of the wound.
258	00:18:26	00:18:29	And the ones that do, don't have blood on them.
259	00:18:29	00:18:31	The killer could have wiped it off.
260	00:18:31	00:18:34	I don't see why the killer would have used a tool anyway, when he had a gun.
261	00:18:34	00:18:38	Maybe Ahern disarmed him and he grabbed whatever was handy.
262	00:18:45	00:18:47	Take a look at this.
263	00:18:47	00:18:49	This guy was tweaker organized.
264	00:18:49	00:18:50	There's a place for everything.
265	00:18:50	00:18:53	Except for this.
266	00:18:53	00:18:57	It's got no space in the pegboard and it doesn't match any of the sets.
267	00:18:57	00:19:00	How about that? Got anything else?
268	00:19:00	00:19:01	Nope.
269	00:19:01	00:19:02	Print it.
270	00:20:00	00:20:02	Hey, Tom Harper?
271	00:20:02	00:20:05	Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.
272	00:20:05	00:20:06	May I ask you a couple questions?
273	00:20:06	00:20:07	Do you know a Bianca Desmond?
274	00:20:07	00:20:08	Sounds familiar.
275	00:20:08	00:20:12	You know she's at 1330 Wildflower Lane.
276	00:20:12	00:20:14	Oh, yeah, right. Her.
277	00:20:14	00:20:17	I installed some DSL lines there a few days ago.
278	00:20:17	00:20:19	She answered the door in her panties.
279	00:20:19	00:20:22	So you've got that hard hat, tool belt thing working for you, huh?
280	00:20:22	00:20:24	I wish.
281	00:20:24	00:20:28	Kind of girl that makes you happy to be a man, know what I'm saying? Yeah, I kind of remember.
282	00:20:28	00:20:32	Anyway, we found a tool with your prints on it in a garage, next to a dead guy.
283	00:20:32	00:20:34	Whoa.
284	00:20:34	00:20:36	I-I lost an awl at a job recently.
285	00:20:36	00:20:37	It must have been there.
286	00:20:37	00:20:39	Well, we're going to need to confirm that.
287	00:20:39	00:20:42	Could you get me a work order?
288	00:20:42	00:20:43	Yeah, sure.
289	00:20:43	00:20:45	Um, I'll pull one from the office.
290	00:20:45	00:20:47	I'll run it right over.
291	00:20:50	00:20:54	Kelly, where you going in such a hurry?
292	00:20:54	00:20:56	I have relatives in Provo.
293	00:20:56	00:20:59	I was going to visit them.
294	00:20:59	00:21:03	I cleared it with my P.O.
295	00:21:03	00:21:10	You gonna tell me why a state trooper pulled over my bus and yanked me off?
296	00:21:10	00:21:13	You know a lady named Sylvia Mullins?
297	00:21:13	00:21:14	Yeah.
298	00:21:14	00:21:17	Did you have a meeting with her yesterday?
299	00:21:17	00:21:19	Yeah. So?
300	00:21:19	00:21:22	So why did you have a meeting with her?
301	00:21:22	00:21:27	Sylvia's handling my dad's estate. Hmm.
302	00:21:27	00:21:28	She's the trustee.
303	00:21:29	00:21:31	What's going on here?
304	00:21:31	00:21:34	Ms. Mullins was found in her parking garage...
305	00:21:35	00:21:37	crushed by her own car.
306	00:21:37	00:21:41	And you think I have something to do with it.
307	00:21:41	00:21:47	When you worked in the prison garage, did you just learn how to fix cars or did you learn how to steal them?
308	00:21:47	00:21:48	Are you kidding me?
309	00:21:48	00:21:50	Does it look like I'm kidding you?
310	00:21:50	00:21:57	You waited for her to get out of work so you could let her know how you felt about her.
311	00:22:05	00:22:08	Sylvia was my dad's friend.
312	00:22:08	00:22:11	She was helping me get back on my feet.
313	00:22:11	00:22:16	How I felt was grateful.
314	00:22:16	00:22:21	CSI puts me in jail for something I didn't do.
315	00:22:21	00:22:24	Do you really think I'm going to kill somebody the minute I get out?
316	00:22:26	00:22:28	Hold out your hands.
317	00:22:30	00:22:31	Hold out your hands.
318	00:22:31	00:22:35	Ms. Mullins' air bag deployed on impact.
319	00:22:35	00:22:37	Air bag dust gets everywhere.
320	00:22:40	00:22:42	It's really hard to get rid of.
321	00:22:42	00:22:45	Not if it isn't there.
322	00:22:53	00:22:56	So the soda can bullet and the leg bullet are from the same gun?
323	00:22:56	00:23:00	Yeah. Bobby was able to pull more stria off the leg bullet, but still no IBIS hits.
324	00:23:00	00:23:02	So what about the phone guy, huh?
325	00:23:02	00:23:03	The utility man's always a shade-ball.
326	00:23:04	00:23:07	As much as I love your generalizations, actually, this time you're wrong.
327	00:23:07	00:23:11	The metallic scrapes on the garage floor were titanium.
328	00:23:11	00:23:16	The phone guy's tool was carbon steel. Remember we thought that they might be dealing meth?
329	00:23:16	00:23:19	Brass went ahead and subpoenaed the phone and bank records.
330	00:23:19	00:23:22	Guess who's paying Bianca's mortgage?
331	00:23:23	00:23:24	A Mr. Harry Desmond.
332	00:23:24	00:23:25	Happy Harry?
333	00:23:25	00:23:26	Gas n' Sip Harry Desmond?
334	00:23:26	00:23:28	Who's your daddy?
335	00:23:28	00:23:29	No wonder she didn't work.
336	00:23:29	00:23:31	He owns 50 Gas n' Sips in Vegas.
337	00:23:31	00:23:36	Well, Harry was nice enough to leave us a voice message that was listened to and saved the night of the murder.
338	00:23:38	00:23:39	Bianca, honey, it's Daddy.
339	00:23:39	00:23:42	I got your message about moving to Colorado with Ahren.
340	00:23:42	00:23:44	You can borrow the cabin, but we need to talk about this move.
341	00:23:45	00:23:46	Call me, Princess. I love you.
342	00:23:46	00:23:50	And this is the Desmond cabin in Telluride.
343	00:23:50	00:23:53	Oh, maybe Mr. Desmond is trying to protect the family fortune.
344	00:23:53	00:23:55	Or the family jewels.
345	00:23:56	00:23:59	I got the results back from all those sex stains on the sheets.
346	00:23:59	00:24:03	Ahren, Bianca and Chelsea.
347	00:24:03	00:24:06	I guess they were having a little threesome.
348	00:24:06	00:24:11	Yeah, I just really hope he was only doing one woman at a time.
349	00:24:11	00:24:13	Chelsea is Bianca's mother.
350	00:24:19	00:24:24	Look, I know what it's like to want to kill your daughter's boyfriend.
351	00:24:24	00:24:27	I don't pick fights that I can't win.
352	00:24:27	00:24:30	I kill this one, I got five more dipsticks waiting to take his place.
353	00:24:30	00:24:32	I'd just be pushing the rock up the hill.
354	00:24:32	00:24:35	Besides, I was in New York yesterday.
355	00:24:35	00:24:38	Yeah, but you didn't want them to move away together.
356	00:24:38	00:24:40	I wanted Bianca to get a job.
357	00:24:40	00:24:41	My biggest mistake in life?
358	00:24:41	00:24:44	Giving my baby everything she ever wanted.
359	00:24:44	00:24:46	Your wife doesn't seem to mind your lifestyle.
360	00:24:46	00:24:53	When Bianca was a teenager, they fought like cats in a sack.
361	00:24:53	00:24:56	It's good they've been spending time together.
362	00:24:58	00:24:59	Do you know what they're doing?
363	00:25:00	00:25:04	Well... they're shopping, dancing...
364	00:25:04	00:25:05	You know, girl stuff.
365	00:25:05	00:25:09	They're sleeping with the same man.
366	00:25:20	00:25:24	Look...
367	00:25:24	00:25:28	there was no good reason for Chelsea to marry me back in the day.
368	00:25:28	00:25:30	I had a little money.
369	00:25:30	00:25:32	Nothing like what we have now.
370	00:25:32	00:25:38	She was half my age and ten times better looking.
371	00:25:38	00:25:47	I thought if I kept her on a long leash...
372	00:25:47	00:25:50	maybe she'd never stray that far.
373	00:25:50	00:25:53	You the kind of guy that likes to keep guns in the house?
374	00:25:53	00:25:55	Yeah, of course.
375	00:25:55	00:25:58	I'm going to need to see them.
376	00:26:00	00:26:05	Hey, Catherine, I just got back trace on Kelly Gordon's fingernails.
377	00:26:05	00:26:10	I was looking for air bag dust, but all Hodges found was air.
378	00:26:10	00:26:11	Well, join the club.
379	00:26:11	00:26:15	No usable prints on the parking garage camera either.
380	00:26:15	00:26:18	Okay, I'll have Sofia release her from holding.
381	00:26:18	00:26:20	Those the vic's phone records?
382	00:26:20	00:26:21	Yeah.
383	00:26:21	00:26:22	From her office.
384	00:26:22	00:26:24	Lots of international calls.
385	00:26:26	00:26:28	A lot of 345s. Mm-hmm.
386	00:26:28	00:26:29	Where's that?
387	00:26:29	00:26:30	Cayman Islands.
388	00:26:30	00:26:32	Popular with scuba divers and money launderers.
389	00:26:32	00:26:35	I called a few of the numbers; all banks.
390	00:26:35	00:26:36	Suggests offshore accounts.
391	00:26:37	00:26:39	It's not illegal, but it is very anonymous.
392	00:26:39	00:26:41	It's also a good way to siphon money away from your clients.
393	00:26:41	00:26:43	That's a leap.
394	00:26:43	00:26:47	Hey, somebody wanted this woman dead.
395	00:27:12	00:27:14	Hi, CSI guy.
396	00:27:14	00:27:17	You wondering why you're here?
397	00:27:17	00:27:20	Because you followed the evidence.
398	00:27:20	00:27:24	Because that's what CSIs do.
399	00:27:24	00:27:32	So breathe quick, breathe slow, put your gun in your mouth and pull the trigger.
400	00:27:32	00:27:37	Any way you like, you're going to die here.
401	00:27:37	00:27:40	Okay. Perfect.
402	00:27:46	00:27:50	You're going to die here.
403	00:27:50	00:27:53	Okay. Perfect.
404	00:27:56	00:27:58	Hey, Archie.
405	00:27:58	00:28:04	Hey, I did my best to enhance the parking garage footage, but I just can't get an image on the killer's face.
406	00:28:04	00:28:06	If you got a couple of minutes, I need a voice comparison.
407	00:28:06	00:28:08	Yeah, what do you got?
408	00:28:08	00:28:10	Kelly Gordon's voice on tape.
409	00:28:12	00:28:15	I want to see if it's the other voice on the Walter Gordon audio file.
410	00:28:15	00:28:17	Grissom told you.
411	00:28:17	00:28:19	No, but he obviously told you.
412	00:28:21	00:28:22	Nick, uh...
413	00:28:22	00:28:24	You know what? Forget about it.
414	00:28:24	00:28:27	If this girl's involved, that means she's capable of murder.
415	00:28:27	00:28:28	It's all cued up for you.
416	00:28:28	00:28:30	Her voice is first.
417	00:28:31	00:28:33	Grissom, it's Warrick.
418	00:28:33	00:28:47	None of the guns Bobby test-fired were a match to the bullets, but Chelsea Wannamaker purchased a .22 in her name that was not picked up with the warrant for Harry's guns.
419	00:28:47	00:28:49	Okay. I'm on it.
420	00:28:54	00:28:57	Mrs. Wannamaker.
421	00:29:00	00:29:03	Wow, that's a hell of a rock.
422	00:29:03	00:29:05	I'm surprised I didn't see that the other night.
423	00:29:06	00:29:07	Well, I don't feel safe wearing this to a club.
424	00:29:07	00:29:09	Is that why you own a gun?
425	00:29:09	00:29:11	Well, I used to.
426	00:29:11	00:29:15	But my gun was stolen out of my purse, one night when we went out.
427	00:29:16	00:29:19	Is there something you want to say to me?
428	00:29:19	00:29:23	You trying to buy back some time there, Mrs. Wannamaker?
429	00:29:23	00:29:27	Life's short, but it doesn't end at 40.
430	00:29:27	00:29:29	Oh, I agree with you.
431	00:29:29	00:29:34	But it must be tough for Bianca to have the kind of mother that'd sleep with her boyfriend.
432	00:29:37	00:29:41	The thing with Ahren the other night shouldn't have happened.
433	00:29:41	00:29:44	We were on Ecstasy...
434	00:29:44	00:29:49	and a line got crossed.
435	00:29:50	00:29:51	Oh, yeah.
436	00:29:51	00:29:54	Lay down. Okay.
437	00:29:54	00:29:55	I'll come back.
438	00:29:55	00:29:57	All right, you come right back.
439	00:30:15	00:30:19	Oh, Chelsea, I'm... I'm sorry.
440	00:30:19	00:30:20	I totally thought you were Bianca.
441	00:30:20	00:30:24	That felt so good.
442	00:30:34	00:30:41	Bianca came in and found us.
443	00:30:41	00:30:44	I wish it never would have happened.
444	00:30:44	00:30:48	What's that, getting busy with her boyfriend or getting caught?
445	00:30:48	00:30:53	I want into the living room and I let the two of them talk it out.
446	00:30:53	00:31:00	Next thing I know, she announced that they were moving to Colorado, so it seemed to me like they worked it out.
447	00:31:04	00:31:06	Freud would have a field day with this family.
448	00:31:07	00:31:10	Dad loves his daughter, but Mom only sees the daughter as competition.
449	00:31:10	00:31:13	And everyone wonders why Bianca can't meet a nice boy.
450	00:31:13	00:31:15	Bianca eats nice boys for brunch.
451	00:31:25	00:31:27	Las Vegas Crime Lab.
452	00:31:41	00:31:43	Oh. Sara.
453	00:31:44	00:31:47	Bianca, can you hear me?
454	00:31:47	00:31:49	We need an ambulance.
455	00:31:49	00:31:52	Dispatch, this is CSI Brown.
456	00:31:52	00:31:54	We have a woman down. We need a paramedic.
457	00:32:03	00:32:04	Hey, Bianca.
458	00:32:05	00:32:06	How you feeling?
459	00:32:08	00:32:10	Mr. and Mrs. Desmond...
460	00:32:10	00:32:12	It's Wannamaker.
461	00:32:12	00:32:13	She's never changed her name.
462	00:32:13	00:32:18	Ms. Wannamaker, I'm going to need a few moments alone with Bianca.
463	00:32:29	00:32:32	You never should've told him.
464	00:32:32	00:32:37	My father's an optimist. How do you think they stayed married for 20 years?
465	00:32:37	00:32:44	Bianca, I'm going to assume that whoever did this to you also killed Ahren.
466	00:32:44	00:32:49	And I'm also going to assume that you know who that is.
467	00:32:52	00:32:56	I think you need to stop protecting everyone from themselves.
468	00:32:56	00:32:58	I can't.
469	00:33:02	00:33:04	Excuse me.
470	00:33:04	00:33:06	I just need to check the swelling.
471	00:33:08	00:33:09	How's the tenderness?
472	00:33:09	00:33:11	It's fine.
473	00:33:15	00:33:16	I hope you feel better.
474	00:33:20	00:33:23	Nurse... Nurse?
475	00:33:23	00:33:25	Can I get that glove you were just using?
476	00:33:25	00:33:28	I'm Sara Sidle, I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
477	00:33:29	00:33:31	Here you go.
478	00:33:31	00:33:35	Thanks. Uh, I'm also going to wait around for the SAE kit.
479	00:33:35	00:33:36	She refused.
480	00:33:42	00:33:44	Hey, Grissom...
481	00:33:44	00:33:45	You want to talk to me?
482	00:33:45	00:33:48	Yeah, sit down.
483	00:33:52	00:33:57	I heard that Kelly Gordon may be a suspect in your murder case.
484	00:33:57	00:33:58	Yeah.
485	00:33:58	00:34:00	Is that a problem?
486	00:34:00	00:34:02	No.
487	00:34:02	00:34:04	No, it's not a problem.
488	00:34:04	00:34:07	And by the way, I heard the tape.
489	00:34:07	00:34:09	I did a voice comparison.
490	00:34:10	00:34:13	ROTH IRA, that'd be perfect for you.
491	00:34:13	00:34:16	Sylvia Mullins is the other voice on the tape.
492	00:34:16	00:34:19	She's Walter Gordon's ex-business manager, so...
493	00:34:20	00:34:24	I'm pretty sure she had something to do with my kidnapping.
494	00:34:26	00:34:27	But now she's dead.
495	00:34:27	00:34:30	Yeah.
496	00:34:31	00:34:34	So... it's over.
497	00:34:37	00:34:39	Yep.
498	00:34:39	00:34:40	Good.
499	00:34:41	00:34:43	Good.
500	00:34:52	00:34:56	I think Bianca is covering for her father.
501	00:34:56	00:35:06	Well, we figured out the sticky stuff on Bianca's neck was creosote. It's a timber preservative found on fences, telephone poles and railroad ties.
502	00:35:06	00:35:08	Justin lives on the train tracks.
503	00:35:08	00:35:10	And he's pretty tweaked out.
504	00:35:10	00:35:12	Yeah, but he didn't shoot himself.
505	00:35:12	00:35:18	And I think that if he had done it, Bianca would've told us.
506	00:35:18	00:35:20	What is it?
507	00:35:20	00:35:23	Telephone poles.
508	00:35:23	00:35:29	Tom Harper's work order for Bianca's DSL line was dated December 18.
509	00:35:30	00:35:32	December 18...
510	00:35:33	00:35:36	fell on a Sunday.
511	00:35:36	00:35:38	How many workers you know work on a Sunday?
512	00:35:38	00:35:40	Is this the original document?
513	00:35:40	00:35:42	Yeah.
514	00:35:42	00:35:44	I'm on it.
515	00:35:44	00:35:46	Always the utility guy.
516	00:36:29	00:36:37	There were two different inks on the work order, which means the date on the work order was compromised.
517	00:36:37	00:36:43	Tom Harper made a service call to Bianca's house not in December, but ten months earlier, in February.
518	00:36:43	00:36:44	Why would the guy lie?
519	00:36:44	00:36:48	It appears that he was a lot more to her than just the phone guy.
520	00:36:48	00:36:51	Our bachelorette was a very busy girl.
521	00:36:51	00:37:00	Phone calls from Bianca to Tom are in yellow, from Bianca to Justin are in blue, and from Bianca to Ahren are in pink.
522	00:37:00	00:37:01	There was always overlap.
523	00:37:01	00:37:07	Tom, phone guy-- strong showing from February 18 until June-ish.
524	00:37:07	00:37:09	She called him two, three times a day.
525	00:37:09	00:37:15	And then around June 5, bachelor number two enters the picture-- Justin.
526	00:37:15	00:37:19	Ten days of overlap and then all the calls to Tom stopped until...
527	00:37:19	00:37:21	The week Justin was shot and moved out.
528	00:37:21	00:37:22	Exactly.
529	00:37:23	00:37:28	Ahren entered the picture about five days later in mid-September.
530	00:37:28	00:37:33	At that point, all the phone calls to the other guys stopped until just about a week ago.
531	00:37:33	00:37:35	When she started calling Tom again.
532	00:37:35	00:37:38	Every time this chick calls Tom, somebody gets shot.
533	00:37:38	00:37:39	It's like thermite.
534	00:37:39	00:37:41	Thermite?
535	00:37:41	00:37:48	When you combine two seemingly harmless elements-- aluminum and rust-- press them together, add heat...
536	00:37:48	00:37:51	it creates an explosion so hot it'll burn through steel.
537	00:37:51	00:37:53	Powerful but uncontrollable.
538	00:37:53	00:37:59	It burns and burns until it burns itself out, finally consuming both elements.
539	00:37:59	00:38:01	I guess some people just shouldn't be together.
540	00:38:13	00:38:16	Tom Harper! Come on down!
541	00:38:20	00:38:22	You made me find you twice, Tom, that's a drag.
542	00:38:23	00:38:24	What's the problem?
543	00:38:24	00:38:28	You know, I think you saw Bianca in her panties more than once.
544	00:38:28	00:38:30	Now those could change a man.
545	00:38:32	00:38:35	And it looks like they did.
546	00:38:37	00:38:39	You know, it's fill in the blank.
547	00:38:39	00:38:41	If it walks like a stalker, talks like a stalker...
548	00:38:41	00:38:43	I'm not a stalker.
549	00:38:43	00:38:44	Then what's this?
550	00:38:44	00:38:46	Excellent service?
551	00:38:46	00:38:49	Here's the top of the telephone pole near Bianca's house.
552	00:38:49	00:38:54	Ahren was tapping your girl, so you started tapping her phone.
553	00:38:56	00:38:58	I only listened when I thought she was in trouble.
554	00:38:58	00:39:02	00 a.m. New York time, 00 in the morning in Vegas.
555	00:39:02	00:39:06	You had to be on the pole to hear it because we were on the scene an hour later.
556	00:39:06	00:39:09	Biana, honey, it's Daddy.
557	00:39:09	00:39:12	I got your message about moving to Colorado with Ahren.
558	00:39:13	00:39:15	Stay away from Bianca.
559	00:39:15	00:39:16	Who are you?
560	00:39:16	00:39:18	You're not taking her to Colorado.
561	00:39:18	00:39:20	The hell I'm not.
562	00:39:45	00:39:48	I just wanted her to be happy.
563	00:39:48	00:39:50	With you and no one else. No.
564	00:39:50	00:39:52	Those other guys were jerks.
565	00:39:52	00:39:54	I only wanted to scare him off.
566	00:39:54	00:39:56	Oh, like you did with Justin? That worked.
567	00:39:56	00:40:00	Yeah, but Bianca didn't come running back to you, so I guess you had to scare her, too.
568	00:40:00	00:40:02	What are you doing here?
569	00:40:02	00:40:03	I came to see you.
570	00:40:03	00:40:04	I think you should leave.
571	00:40:04	00:40:06	Your mom wants us to be together.
572	00:40:06	00:40:07	My mom?!
573	00:40:07	00:40:09	Let go!
574	00:40:11	00:40:16	Her mother and I weren't always going to be around to clean up her messes.
575	00:40:16	00:40:18	Wait a minute.
576	00:40:18	00:40:22	Are you telling me that Chelsea asked you to hurt these guys?
577	00:40:24	00:40:32	So you have some lunatic stalker telephone repairman claiming that I told him to kill my daughter's boyfriends?
578	00:40:32	00:40:34	Give me a break.
579	00:40:35	00:40:38	We have multiple calls to him from Bianca's house and it was not her.
580	00:40:38	00:40:42	We also have on the record that you called him from your cell.
581	00:40:42	00:40:45	Coincidentally, right around the time Justin was shot and Ahren was killed.
582	00:40:46	00:40:49	We call that solicitation for murder.
583	00:40:49	00:40:51	But you'd probably call it, what, good mother?
584	00:40:51	00:40:52	I love my daughter.
585	00:40:52	00:40:55	Yeah, apparently, a lot of her boyfriends, too.
586	00:40:55	00:40:58	I called Tom.
587	00:40:58	00:41:02	I asked him to scare Justin away.
588	00:41:02	00:41:03	He was after Bianca for her money.
589	00:41:03	00:41:05	I mean, we have to protect ourselves.
590	00:41:05	00:41:09	Yeah, but Ahren didn't love her for her money.
591	00:41:09	00:41:12	What was wrong with him?
592	00:41:12	00:41:18	So he was good enough for you, but too good for your daughter, was that it?
593	00:41:18	00:41:23	I mean, finding a soul mate is hard enough, but competing with your mother, that shouldn't be an issue.
594	00:41:23	00:41:27	That goes against... I don't know, nature.
595	00:41:27	00:41:31	I was attracted to Ahren...
596	00:41:31	00:41:36	and I was just trying to keep him away from Bianca and me.
597	00:41:36	00:41:41	Lady, you unleashed an unstable man that you knew was in love with your daughter.
598	00:41:42	00:41:45	You had to know that that was not going to end well.
599	00:41:48	00:41:50	Oh, hey, Nick.
600	00:41:50	00:41:53	Nick. Yeah?
601	00:41:53	00:41:55	We caught a break.
602	00:41:55	00:41:57	The security guard confessed.
603	00:41:57	00:41:59	No.
604	00:41:59	00:42:04	Archie isolated a frame of the killer turning the focus ring.
605	00:42:13	00:42:15	She did it.
606	00:42:23	00:42:25	Las Vegas Police! Open up!
607	00:42:31	00:42:34	Kelly Gordon, you're under arrest for the murder of Sylvia Mullins.
608	00:42:34	00:42:36	Stand up.
609	00:42:36	00:42:38	Stand up!
610	00:42:43	00:42:44	Care why I did it?
611	00:42:44	00:42:47	Doesn't really matter now.
612	00:42:47	00:42:50	She told me my dad didn't leave me anything.
613	00:42:50	00:42:52	He never would've done that.
614	00:42:52	00:42:55	He loved me.
615	00:42:55	00:42:57	So you killed her?
616	00:42:57	00:42:59	The ransom was her idea.
617	00:42:59	00:43:01	She didn't get the money.
618	00:43:01	00:43:02	She took it from me.
619	00:43:07	00:43:08	She's ODing. She's ODing right now.
620	00:43:08	00:43:09	Call a paramedic.
621	00:43:09	00:43:11	Vicodine, INH, methadone.
622	00:43:11	00:43:14	Kelly! Kelly!
623	00:43:14	00:43:15	Kelly!
