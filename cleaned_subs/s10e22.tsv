0	00:01:30	00:01:35	Lividity is fixed, consistent with her body position.
1	00:01:35	00:01:37	No apparent discoloration.
2	00:01:37	00:01:39	Puts T.O.D. around 24 to 48 hours ago.
3	00:01:39	00:01:44	Brass said the Dumpster diver that called it in hadn't been down this way in a few days.
4	00:01:47	00:01:50	Four-plus-one impressions on her throat.
5	00:01:50	00:01:52	Manual strangulation.
6	00:01:52	00:01:54	There's also a thin abrasion.
7	00:01:54	00:01:57	Killer swapped her necklace for a choker?
8	00:02:01	00:02:04	Where's the source of that blood?
9	00:02:05	00:02:08	It's a V-shaped wound.
10	00:02:09	00:02:10	Doesn't look too deep.
11	00:02:10	00:02:12	Maybe incidental to the strangulation?
12	00:02:12	00:02:15	Blood flow defies gravity.
13	00:02:23	00:02:27	She bled in an upright position and was moved after death.
14	00:02:28	00:02:30	I think she might have been dumped here.
15	00:02:30	00:02:33	There is some yellow trace in the wound.
16	00:02:33	00:02:35	I got a purse.
17	00:02:47	00:02:49	Heidi Custer.
18	00:02:49	00:02:50	New York, New York.
19	00:02:52	00:02:54	Business cards.
20	00:02:54	00:02:56	Just her name and a 212 phone number.
21	00:02:56	00:02:58	No cash.
22	00:02:59	00:03:01	Maybe a robbery gone bad.
23	00:03:01	00:03:03	Cell phone.
24	00:03:05	00:03:06	Room key from the Luxor.
25	00:03:09	00:03:11	Joey Bigelow?
26	00:03:11	00:03:14	Hey, uh, guys...
27	00:03:14	00:03:20	she's carrying photos of all of Jekyll's victims.
28	00:03:20	00:03:21	Multiple copies.
29	00:03:21	00:03:23	She a cop? No badge or creds.
30	00:03:23	00:03:26	So, what was her interest in the Jekyll case?
31	00:03:26	00:03:30	And did he have any interest in her?
32	00:04:09	00:04:11	The Lone Ranger returns.
33	00:04:11	00:04:14	Lately, you've had more solos than a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert.
34	00:04:14	00:04:15	I don't mind working alone.
35	00:04:15	00:04:19	Uh, I wanted to speak with you about something else, actually.
36	00:04:19	00:04:21	Um, Heidi Custer.
37	00:04:21	00:04:23	The woman found in the alley?
38	00:04:23	00:04:25	Yes.
39	00:04:25	00:04:27	I knew her.
40	00:04:27	00:04:30	Really?
41	00:04:30	00:04:31	She was a reporter.
42	00:04:32	00:04:36	She covered the Angel of Death murders at Delaware General while I was there.
43	00:04:36	00:04:39	We spent quite a bit of time talking back then.
44	00:04:39	00:04:42	You talk to her recently? No, it's been years.
45	00:04:42	00:04:44	But she was a great reporter.
46	00:04:44	00:04:45	Fierce, tenacious.
47	00:04:45	00:04:49	Well, Brass reached her husband, who's also the editor of the magazine she writes for.
48	00:04:49	00:04:54	He's been in L.A. all week, and confirmed that she was working on a story about Jekyll.
49	00:04:54	00:04:56	Do we know when she got into town? Monday.
50	00:04:56	00:04:58	How much could she discover in three days?
51	00:04:58	00:05:02	Reporter like Heidi wouldn't have come out here without a good lead.
52	00:05:02	00:05:04	It's possible that she turned up something that we didn't.
53	00:05:04	00:05:06	Well, Nick is heading to her hotel room. You should join him.
54	00:05:06	00:05:08	All right.
55	00:05:21	00:05:23	No signs of a struggle, no blood.
56	00:05:23	00:05:25	This doesn't look like the primary.
57	00:05:25	00:05:31	And according to Heidi's credit card records, she had a rented Malibu, which is still M.I.A.
58	00:05:31	00:05:33	Yeah.
59	00:05:38	00:05:39	Where's her work?
60	00:05:39	00:05:43	Where are her notes and... her research?
61	00:05:43	00:05:47	There's a camera charger here and a laptop power cord.
62	00:05:47	00:05:50	But she could have the camera and the computer in her car.
63	00:05:50	00:05:53	Right, or it could be in the hands of her killer. Yeah.
64	00:05:53	00:05:58	Blue Aces Casino Player's Club Card here.
65	00:05:58	00:05:59	It's a locals only type place.
66	00:06:00	00:06:01	I know.
67	00:06:01	00:06:04	Jack Herson clocked some credit card debt there.
68	00:06:04	00:06:07	It's also along Joey Bigelow's panhandling route.
69	00:06:07	00:06:11	And why don't I remember any of that?
70	00:06:11	00:06:15	I've been following up on some of the Jekyll leads in my spare time.
71	00:06:15	00:06:16	Oh, you have?
72	00:06:16	00:06:19	Yeah, I've been talking to victims' families and friends.
73	00:06:19	00:06:21	Trying to get a feel for their habits.
74	00:06:21	00:06:22	Trying to get a feel for Jekyll.
75	00:06:22	00:06:24	Ray...
76	00:06:24	00:06:28	this job will eat you alive if you take it home with you.
77	00:06:30	00:06:40	Okay, so, two victims connected to the Jekyll case, and a reporter who was investigating it all visited the same little casino.
78	00:06:40	00:06:43	If Heidi used that player's card anywhere, we should be able to find her on surveillance.
79	00:06:43	00:06:45	Right.
80	00:06:47	00:06:50	What about that?
81	00:06:50	00:06:53	That looks exactly like the letter L.
82	00:06:53	00:06:56	Could be a message from Jekyll. L for...
83	00:06:56	00:07:11	David, those are two surgical screws, implanted at a 90-degree angle as part of a knee operation, documented in her medical records as having been performed three years ago by a doctor whose name was distinctly not Jekyll.
84	00:07:11	00:07:14	Let it go.
85	00:07:14	00:07:16	Hey, David, Doc.
86	00:07:16	00:07:18	What do we have?
87	00:07:18	00:07:19	C.O.D.'s no surprise.
88	00:07:20	00:07:22	Asphyxiation via manual strangulation.
89	00:07:22	00:07:24	Broken hyoid.
90	00:07:24	00:07:27	Superficial head wound clotted.
91	00:07:27	00:07:29	Later reopened around the time of death.
92	00:07:29	00:07:42	As for the question of whether she was a Jekyll victim-- I performed a thorough examination for puncture wounds, laparoscopic entry points, and despite David's imaginative analysis...
93	00:07:42	00:07:44	Greg, tell me that does not look exactly like a smiley face.
94	00:07:44	00:07:48	There was nothing out of the ordinary.
95	00:07:48	00:07:52	No unaccounted for objects or organs inside her.
96	00:07:52	00:08:03	So, Heidi Custer could be another victim like Lily Xiaoping-- a spur-of-the-moment, unplanned kill by a cornered Jekyll who was simply trying to avoid capture.
97	00:08:05	00:08:12	Hey, Archie, I brought you that blinky thing from the beepy no-working thing you told me you'd take a look at.
98	00:08:12	00:08:14	Is that...?
99	00:08:14	00:08:15	Yeah.
100	00:08:15	00:08:17	Anything on the Blue Aces surveillance, Archie?
101	00:08:17	00:08:20	Actually, there is.
102	00:08:22	00:08:23	30 p.m. Monday.
103	00:08:23	00:08:28	Heidi Custer goes into the casino bar.
104	00:08:29	00:08:30	Okay.
105	00:08:30	00:08:33	30 seconds before that...
106	00:08:39	00:08:41	Langston goes into the bar.
107	00:08:41	00:08:44	There's no surveillance inside the bar.
108	00:08:44	00:08:46	But 20 minutes later, Langston leaves.
109	00:08:46	00:08:48	15 seconds after that...
110	00:08:50	00:08:52	Heidi leaves.
111	00:08:52	00:08:55	Did he say anything about meeting her for a drink?
112	00:08:57	00:08:59	Thanks.
113	00:09:04	00:09:09	Afghanistan, Liberia, Iraq.
114	00:09:09	00:09:15	Of all the places she went for stories, I never-- I never thought Vegas would be the one that got her.
115	00:09:15	00:09:18	You see this mark around her neck?
116	00:09:18	00:09:20	Did your wife wear a necklace?
117	00:09:23	00:09:25	Amber pendant.
118	00:09:25	00:09:28	Well, gift from a Congolese rebel.
119	00:09:28	00:09:31	I was never able to get her to wear her wedding ring, but...
120	00:09:31	00:09:35	she never took that damn thing off.
121	00:09:35	00:09:38	I always knew I came second to her work.
122	00:09:38	00:09:42	But she was worth it.
123	00:09:44	00:09:47	Yeah, I heard she was a hell of a reporter.
124	00:09:50	00:09:51	A colleague of mine knew her.
125	00:09:51	00:09:54	Ray Langston.
126	00:09:55	00:09:58	Ray Langston's a cop?
127	00:09:58	00:10:01	No, he's a CSI.
128	00:10:01	00:10:04	Ray Langston is a murderer.
129	00:10:12	00:10:17	About five years ago, my wife was writing a piece on the Angel of Death at Delaware General Hospital.
130	00:10:17	00:10:22	27 patients were murdered by injection of ethylene glycol into their IVs.
131	00:10:22	00:10:26	Langston was a pathologist at the hospital...
132	00:10:26	00:10:28	and a very helpful source to Heidi.
133	00:10:28	00:10:30	At first.
134	00:10:30	00:10:40	If the tragedy at Delaware General is ever granted the full autopsy it deserves, a haunting truth will be revealed in the harsh morgue light.
135	00:10:40	00:10:48	When the primary suspect, Dr. Michael Webb killed himself, the same way he killed his patients, the police and hospital quickly closed the case.
136	00:10:48	00:10:57	Even though there was compelling evidence that Dr. Webb did not act alone. Death by ethylene glycol does not arrive unheralded.
137	00:10:57	00:11:02	Distinct crystals of calcium oxalate accumulate in the tubules of the kidney.
138	00:11:02	00:11:13	And yet, with the evidence of Dr. Webb's murders literally glittering before him, Delaware General's pathologist, Raymond Langston, claimed to have seen nothing unusual.
139	00:11:13	00:11:21	27 times over, he saw nothing and allowed Dr. Webb's sinister work to continue.
140	00:11:21	00:11:23	Well, I talked to CSI Langston.
141	00:11:24	00:11:26	He had nothing but admiration for your wife.
142	00:11:26	00:11:28	He never mentioned her article.
143	00:11:28	00:11:30	That's because we never published it.
144	00:11:30	00:11:32	It never passed the fact-checking process.
145	00:11:32	00:11:34	So, her accusations were false?
146	00:11:34	00:11:35	I didn't say that.
147	00:11:35	00:11:37	We kill stories all the time...
148	00:11:37	00:11:40	because reporters rely too heavily on unnamed sources.
149	00:11:40	00:11:47	And the only reason that this story got spiked was because a bunch of lawyers were too afraid the magazine was gonna get sued.
150	00:11:47	00:11:49	But my wife was right.
151	00:11:49	00:11:52	He helped Dr. Webb, and now he's helping Dr. Jekyll.
152	00:11:52	00:11:56	CSI Langston has been relentless in his pursuit of Dr. Jekyll.
153	00:11:56	00:12:01	He was personally assaulted by the suspect.
154	00:12:04	00:12:06	And you saw this happen?
155	00:12:06	00:12:08	The gash in his head-- that told the story.
156	00:12:08	00:12:13	Giving himself a bump on the head-- nice touch of authenticity.
157	00:12:13	00:12:19	Raymond Langston hid behind a lab coat, and now he's hiding behind a badge.
158	00:12:22	00:12:25	It's a lovely shade of saffron, no?
159	00:12:28	00:12:31	Just got my annual trace metals report.
160	00:12:31	00:12:35	Hmm, my mercury is as high as the Baker thermometer.
161	00:12:35	00:12:37	Guess I should lay off that tuna sushi.
162	00:12:37	00:12:39	Otherwise, I'm facing chelation therapy.
163	00:12:40	00:12:44	The trace we found in Heidi Custer's head wound was lead paint.
164	00:12:44	00:12:47	My lead levels are well within the normal range.
165	00:12:47	00:12:54	The weapon could have been any tool or implement with a 90-degree angle and old enough to have lead paint.
166	00:12:54	00:12:56	Or a super fun new toy from China.
167	00:12:56	00:12:58	Ray.
168	00:12:58	00:12:59	Yes.
169	00:12:59	00:13:00	My office.
170	00:13:00	00:13:01	Right.
171	00:13:06	00:13:08	She came at me in disguise, Catherine.
172	00:13:08	00:13:11	She pretended to value my insights, and the whole time Heidi was investigating me.
173	00:13:11	00:13:12	Ray...
174	00:13:13	00:13:14	This article of hers is full of junk science.
175	00:13:14	00:13:16	That's not the issue here.
176	00:13:16	00:13:21	I examined samples that I received from other doctors.
177	00:13:21	00:13:27	Dr. Webb wasn't just going to send me evidence of his murders, and when his mortality rates became suspicious, I was the one that bucked protocol.
178	00:13:27	00:13:30	I started autopsying the bodies myself.
179	00:13:30	00:13:33	We're not here about the article or your feelings, Ray.
180	00:13:33	00:13:36	You met with a homicide victim shortly before she died.
181	00:13:36	00:13:40	What are you talking about? And then withheld that information from your supervisor.
182	00:13:45	00:13:52	I was at the Blue Aces, but I was there on my own time, and I swear, Catherine, I never saw her there.
183	00:13:56	00:13:59	Conrad... you know what a casino floor is like.
184	00:13:59	00:14:03	It's a maze of slot machines and gaming tables.
185	00:14:04	00:14:08	You know, I admire you guys for sticking together, I really do.
186	00:14:08	00:14:18	I'm not saying I don't believe you, Ray-- I'm struggling to-- but when we catch Heidi's killer, 12 members of a jury aren't going to be as understanding as Catherine when it comes to coincidence.
187	00:14:19	00:14:23	They're just going to see an over-involved CSI who had a conflict of interest.
188	00:14:23	00:14:25	So... it's hands off.
189	00:14:25	00:14:27	You can't work this one.
190	00:15:03	00:15:07	Ray, Catherine just told me what happened with Ecklie.
191	00:15:07	00:15:08	What are you doing in here?
192	00:15:08	00:15:09	Take a look at this.
193	00:15:09	00:15:14	Heidi Custer used her credit card at the Blue Aces when I was there.
194	00:15:14	00:15:18	Then she used it again to park at WLVU Medical School.
195	00:15:18	00:15:21	I was there-- same place, same time.
196	00:15:21	00:15:23	Heidi Custer was following me.
197	00:15:23	00:15:24	Why would she do something like that?
198	00:15:24	00:15:27	Because she thought I was connected to the Jekyll murders.
199	00:15:27	00:15:29	I'm investigating Jekyll, she's investigating me.
200	00:15:29	00:15:33	All right, all right, if anybody asks, though, I found this, you didn't.
201	00:15:33	00:15:36	Now, you got to get out of here-- I think you're up next for call-outs. I may have led her to Jekyll.
202	00:15:36	00:15:37	I may have gotten her killed.
203	00:15:37	00:15:38	You don't know that.
204	00:15:38	00:15:43	I was going to all the places that Jekyll's victims went to, places that Jekyll may have gone to himself.
205	00:15:43	00:15:48	Heidi was there asking questions about Jekyll, She asked the wrong person the wrong question.
206	00:15:48	00:15:51	I need to go out there. I need to retrace my steps.
207	00:15:51	00:15:53	No, no, we'll go back out, as a team.
208	00:15:53	00:15:55	You need to stay off this case and trust us.
209	00:15:55	00:15:57	We'll handle it.
210	00:15:57	00:15:59	I'm going to get you my notes.
211	00:16:00	00:16:01	All right.
212	00:16:05	00:16:07	He's off the Heidi Custer case.
213	00:16:07	00:16:11	I want to tell you something, but you cannot tell anybody else.
214	00:16:11	00:16:13	You know me.
215	00:16:13	00:16:15	Okay, this time I swear.
216	00:16:15	00:16:16	I promise.
217	00:16:16	00:16:18	Do you remember the Botanica case?
218	00:16:19	00:16:23	Langston had palpated some grout with his bare hands.
219	00:16:23	00:16:26	So I asked him for a control DNA sample because I wanted to exclude him, right?
220	00:16:26	00:16:29	Well, in that case, I just need a sample of your DNA and I will exclude you.
221	00:16:29	00:16:32	You're going to have to put in your report that I said no.
222	00:16:32	00:16:33	He refused.
223	00:16:33	00:16:37	Well, after seeing Gattaca, you can't hardly blame him.
224	00:16:37	00:16:39	We all have privacy issues.
225	00:16:39	00:16:47	Okay, that's a valid point, but a couple months before that, he was in the break room, and he was reading somebody's genetic report about M.A.O.A. deficiency.
226	00:16:47	00:16:50	You know, that specific mutation right there has actually been linked to violent behavior.
227	00:16:50	00:16:53	M.A.O.A. deficiency doesn't make you violent.
228	00:16:53	00:16:55	Just 'cause something might happen, doesn't mean it will.
229	00:16:55	00:16:57	It's genetics, it's not destiny.
230	00:16:57	00:17:00	I see your need for the cone of silence.
231	00:17:00	00:17:04	First his hospital, his classroom and now here.
232	00:17:04	00:17:07	The man does seem to be a magnet for serial killers.
233	00:17:07	00:17:12	I understand not wanting to share the details of your personal life with your coworkers.
234	00:17:12	00:17:16	But when you don't share the fruits of your investigative work...
235	00:17:16	00:17:17	No, he will from now on.
236	00:17:17	00:17:19	He wasn't purposely shutting us out.
237	00:17:19	00:17:21	Look, I really like Ray.
238	00:17:21	00:17:24	I think he's a great CSI.
239	00:17:24	00:17:27	But if he doesn't trust us, how can we have his back?
240	00:17:27	00:17:28	And how can he have ours?
241	00:17:28	00:17:34	Hey, Heidi Custer used her credit card Wednesday night 05 p.m. to get gas.
242	00:17:34	00:17:36	I called the station.
243	00:17:36	00:17:38	I got a surveillance photo of her at the pump.
244	00:17:38	00:17:42	Now, that narrows down time of death to Wednesday night.
245	00:17:42	00:17:43	It does something else, too.
246	00:17:43	00:17:46	It gives Langston an alibi for Heidi's murder.
247	00:17:46	00:17:48	05 p.m., he was already at work.
248	00:17:48	00:17:50	Solo burglary.
249	00:17:50	00:17:52	He was gone a couple of hours.
250	00:17:55	00:17:58	Well, it's easy enough to confirm he was there, right?
251	00:18:07	00:18:09	Crime scene photos are all time coded.
252	00:18:09	00:18:11	20.
253	00:18:12	00:18:14	20.
254	00:18:14	00:18:16	24.
255	00:18:16	00:18:21	32... and the last one's 40.
256	00:18:21	00:18:23	So, he obviously photoed first.
257	00:18:23	00:18:26	Three latent prints in two hours?
258	00:18:28	00:18:30	That's all he collected?
259	00:18:31	00:18:34	What else was Langston doing?
260	00:18:37	00:18:39	Parking control spotted Heidi Custer's vehicle.
261	00:18:39	00:18:40	Let's start a canvass.
262	00:18:41	00:18:44	See if anybody recognizes her or saw who parked the car.
263	00:18:45	00:18:46	Thanks.
264	00:18:51	00:18:55	Well, she wouldn't have walked away and left the keys in the ignition.
265	00:18:58	00:19:00	No laptop, no camera.
266	00:19:00	00:19:02	Nothing in here either.
267	00:19:03	00:19:11	So, the killer dumps Heidi in the alley a couple miles away, drives over here and walks away with the camera and the laptop.
268	00:19:11	00:19:16	A private lot like this is rarely patrolled by police or parking control.
269	00:19:16	00:19:21	Dumping the car here indicates the perp may have some knowledge of law enforcement.
270	00:19:21	00:19:26	Well, if they were banking on us not finding the car, maybe there's something inside it.
271	00:19:58	00:20:00	Bloody print on the steering wheel.
272	00:20:05	00:20:07	More blood over here.
273	00:20:32	00:20:36	I was going to all the places that Jekyll's victims went to.
274	00:20:36	00:20:37	Places that Jekyll may have gone to himself.
275	00:20:37	00:20:40	I need to go out there. I need to retrace my steps.
276	00:20:40	00:20:43	You need to stay off this case and trust us.
277	00:20:43	00:20:45	I may have led her to Jekyll. I may have gotten her killed.
278	00:21:08	00:21:10	Hello. My name's Ray Langston.
279	00:21:10	00:21:12	I'm with the Vegas Crime Lab.
280	00:21:12	00:21:15	I came in here the other day and showed you some pictures. You remember?
281	00:21:15	00:21:17	Oh, yeah, I remember.
282	00:21:17	00:21:20	Um, I have one more photograph to show you.
283	00:21:20	00:21:21	Do you recognize this woman?
284	00:21:21	00:21:24	No. I don't make eye contact with the customers.
285	00:21:24	00:21:25	It only encourages them to yell.
286	00:21:25	00:21:28	I'm trying to find out if she came in here shortly after I did the other day.
287	00:21:29	00:21:30	Maybe she spoke with someone else?
288	00:21:30	00:21:33	Uh, a white male, average build?
289	00:21:33	00:21:37	I've never seen her. But I know we got surveillance, 'cause the night shift gets robbed all the time.
290	00:21:37	00:21:41	All right, I'll, uh, come back with a warrant. Thank you.
291	00:22:04	00:22:06	You son of a bitch, you killed my wife!
292	00:22:07	00:22:09	You killed my wife, you son of a bitch!
293	00:22:09	00:22:13	You son... you killed my wife!
294	00:22:13	00:22:16	You just, you're gonna let him go?
295	00:22:16	00:22:17	Just let him walk away?
296	00:22:17	00:22:18	This guy's a murderer!
297	00:22:18	00:22:19	I'm telling you he's a murderer!
298	00:22:20	00:22:22	He blindsided me, Catherine Yeah, I know the feeling.
299	00:22:22	00:22:24	What are you doing here?
300	00:22:24	00:22:26	I was on my way to a 406 on Riviera.
301	00:22:26	00:22:31	And you decided to stop for a soda and the Jekyll Killer special, is that it?
302	00:22:31	00:22:34	Ray, you got to quit playing detective, you know?
303	00:22:34	00:22:39	'Cause I don't have time to keep getting your ass out of jams that you shouldn't be in in the first place.
304	00:22:40	00:22:44	So this is why it took you two hours to lift three points at your last 406?
305	00:22:44	00:22:45	You're running your own investigation.
306	00:22:45	00:22:51	Catherine, listen... Right. It's a lot harder to blindside a guy if he follows the playbook and trusts his team.
307	00:22:51	00:22:53	I was honestly on my way to my scene. I passed...
308	00:22:54	00:22:55	You're not going to your scene anymore. You're going home.
309	00:22:55	00:22:57	You're suspending me?
310	00:22:57	00:22:58	No, I'm diagnosing you.
311	00:22:58	00:22:59	You got the whatever virus.
312	00:22:59	00:23:01	Take a sick day.
313	00:23:50	00:23:51	Hey.
314	00:23:51	00:23:52	Hey.
315	00:23:52	00:23:55	Come on in.
316	00:23:57	00:24:02	Catherine send you to take my temperature?
317	00:24:02	00:24:04	No. No, I'm not a doctor.
318	00:24:04	00:24:08	Maybe if I was, I could decipher your chicken-scratch handwriting.
319	00:24:11	00:24:13	Nice place.
320	00:24:13	00:24:14	Thank you.
321	00:24:14	00:24:17	Single-malt.
322	00:24:17	00:24:18	Boy, that's good stuff.
323	00:24:18	00:24:21	Dr. Robbins brought it by last week.
324	00:24:21	00:24:23	Care for a snort?
325	00:24:23	00:24:24	I'm, I'm good.
326	00:24:24	00:24:26	Sure?
327	00:24:26	00:24:28	Good stuff.
328	00:24:28	00:24:29	I'm sure it is.
329	00:24:33	00:24:34	We can work back there.
330	00:24:34	00:24:36	All right.
331	00:25:01	00:25:06	You've been, uh, busy, huh?
332	00:25:07	00:25:09	Just a little bit.
333	00:25:23	00:25:26	What, uh, what happened over here?
334	00:25:26	00:25:31	Those are leads I decided to eliminate; crackpot theories mostly.
335	00:25:31	00:25:35	Tinfoil-hat ramblings, some of which are not even my own.
336	00:25:35	00:25:37	You know how it is, Nick.
337	00:25:37	00:25:41	You listen to any piece of music long enough, it starts to sound good.
338	00:25:42	00:25:45	We found Heidi's rental car.
339	00:25:45	00:25:48	Unknown fingerprint on the steering wheel.
340	00:25:48	00:25:52	Heidi's blood on the interior of the passenger-side door.
341	00:25:52	00:25:55	The car went off the road at some point.
342	00:25:58	00:26:03	Did you have any places of interest out in the desert, off the beaten path?
343	00:26:03	00:26:10	Sure. A dump where Jack Herson used to salvage scrap metal, an airstrip where Bernard Higgins used to charter jets.
344	00:26:10	00:26:16	Half a dozen other places, You think she could have homed in on some of your leads going out here on her own?
345	00:26:16	00:26:20	I didn't go out to any of those places while she was following me, but...
346	00:26:20	00:26:23	sure, I suppose it's possible.
347	00:26:25	00:26:28	Ecklie's not gonna like us running around all over the place.
348	00:26:28	00:26:31	Us?
349	00:26:31	00:26:35	Yeah, man, we're a team. Come on.
350	00:26:40	00:26:41	Okay?
351	00:26:42	00:26:46	Now, who's this on the back wall over here?
352	00:26:49	00:26:52	Ah... yes.
353	00:26:52	00:26:55	My family.
354	00:26:56	00:26:58	my father.
355	00:26:58	00:27:01	A man with a very violent temper.
356	00:27:01	00:27:08	I sometimes wonder if my affinity for Chicago blues isn't the only thing that I inherited from him.
357	00:27:10	00:27:14	You know, I think everybody has a violent streak in 'em.
358	00:27:15	00:27:16	I know I do.
359	00:27:16	00:27:20	But it's how we deal with it that determines who we are as men.
360	00:27:26	00:27:29	We brought soup, bagels...
361	00:27:29	00:27:31	And bat feces.
362	00:27:31	00:27:32	I'd prefer cream cheese.
363	00:27:32	00:27:33	Come on in.
364	00:27:34	00:27:38	Hodges analyzed the trace recovered from the Malibu's tires-- bat guano.
365	00:27:39	00:27:46	And based on the insect matter, the little morsels were the work of the free-tailed bat.
366	00:27:46	00:27:49	Considering the large amount of the sample, the car must've been driven near a bat roosting spot.
367	00:27:49	00:27:51	Mines, caves.
368	00:27:51	00:27:54	There are a lot of those around Clark County.
369	00:27:55	00:27:57	But we can eliminate most of them.
370	00:27:57	00:28:01	The Malibu's tires were clean 05 p.m.
371	00:28:01	00:28:03	She started with a full tank of gas.
372	00:28:03	00:28:06	Malibus can get, you know, up to 34 miles to the gallon.
373	00:28:06	00:28:12	We found the car with a half a gallon consumed, which means she drove up to 17 miles after she filled up.
374	00:28:12	00:28:15	Maximum 8.5 miles out, 8.5 miles back.
375	00:28:15	00:28:20	There are only a handful of caves and mines within 8.5 miles of that gas station.
376	00:28:20	00:28:23	We marked them here.
377	00:28:23	00:28:25	Huh, Lobo Flats.
378	00:28:25	00:28:27	Were you out there? Mm-hmm.
379	00:28:27	00:28:28	What was the lead?
380	00:28:28	00:28:30	A fairy tale.
381	00:28:30	00:28:32	That's why I tore it down.
382	00:28:32	00:28:36	A couple of weeks ago, I was out at WLVU Medical School.
383	00:28:36	00:28:40	A man approached me, a coffee server named Vince Grady.
384	00:28:40	00:28:41	Badge lover.
385	00:28:41	00:28:45	He said he was interested in what I was working on.
386	00:28:45	00:28:47	Dr. Langston?
387	00:28:47	00:28:50	You're still investigating the Dr. Jekyll case, right?
388	00:28:50	00:28:51	Yes.
389	00:28:51	00:28:55	I saw something this weekend.
390	00:28:55	00:28:58	Why don't you have a seat.
391	00:29:00	00:29:04	I was out near Lobo Flats looking for arrowheads.
392	00:29:04	00:29:07	Valuable stuff out there if you've got the eyes for it.
393	00:29:08	00:29:09	That's where I saw him.
394	00:29:09	00:29:11	There was blood all over his scrubs.
395	00:29:11	00:29:13	So I went out there with Vince.
396	00:29:13	00:29:16	At first, I thought, Why would he be way out here?
397	00:29:16	00:29:19	But if you think about it, it's the perfect place.
398	00:29:19	00:29:21	Nobody could hear his victims scream.
399	00:29:21	00:29:24	Who knows how many victims he's chalked up by this point.
400	00:29:24	00:29:27	Could have bodies buried all around here.
401	00:29:27	00:29:31	Might consider bringing out some cadaver dogs or ground-penetrating radar.
402	00:29:31	00:29:33	Place wasn't even locked.
403	00:29:33	00:29:36	Hardly the fastidious work of a killer like Jekyll.
404	00:29:36	00:29:40	And what I found inside did nothing to assuage those doubts.
405	00:29:40	00:29:42	He's good.
406	00:29:42	00:29:43	Not a drop of blood anywhere.
407	00:29:43	00:29:45	The guy's a genius.
408	00:29:45	00:29:48	I'll be sure to integrate this lead into our investigation.
409	00:29:53	00:29:55	Is this the place?
410	00:29:55	00:29:57	Yes.
411	00:30:15	00:30:16	It's all clear.
412	00:30:16	00:30:18	All right, Ray, I'm heading in.
413	00:30:18	00:30:20	Copy that.
414	00:31:14	00:31:17	I got a stain on the floor in here.
415	00:31:17	00:31:19	Blood?
416	00:31:25	00:31:28	Nick, you there?
417	00:31:28	00:31:30	Nick, you there?
418	00:31:30	00:31:32	Nick, you there?!
419	00:31:32	00:31:34	Yeah.
420	00:31:34	00:31:36	Yeah, and so was someone else.
421	00:31:56	00:31:58	Got a toolbox here.
422	00:32:01	00:32:05	Yellow paint like we found in Heidi's head wound.
423	00:32:05	00:32:09	And some of the paint's been knocked off one of the corners.
424	00:32:19	00:32:23	I may even have a partial palm print.
425	00:32:27	00:32:31	The bloody fingerprints from the fridge are Heidi Custer's.
426	00:32:31	00:32:35	Well, what about the palm print from the toolbox?
427	00:32:35	00:32:37	Running it right now.
428	00:32:41	00:32:43	No match.
429	00:32:43	00:32:48	And no way to tell if it's from the same contributor as the bloody fingerprint from the steering wheel in Heidi's car.
430	00:32:48	00:32:55	That means Heidi was in the building and alive at least long enough to have left her prints.
431	00:32:55	00:33:01	Ray, if you haven't been back out to this place since she came to town, how did she learn about it?
432	00:33:01	00:33:05	Perhaps from the same person who led me out there.
433	00:33:07	00:33:10	Happy to aid you with the Jekyll investigation.
434	00:33:12	00:33:15	Has Dr. Langston been following up on my lead?
435	00:33:17	00:33:22	Mr. Grady, you recognize her?
436	00:33:23	00:33:25	Yes, ma'am.
437	00:33:27	00:33:28	She-she's dead?
438	00:33:28	00:33:30	Mm-hmm.
439	00:33:32	00:33:34	Nev-never should have taken her out there.
440	00:33:35	00:33:39	She said that she had seen me talking to Dr. Langston.
441	00:33:39	00:33:43	Gave him a big lead in the Dr. Jekyll investigation.
442	00:33:43	00:33:44	It was integrated.
443	00:33:44	00:33:46	Oh.
444	00:33:46	00:33:48	What was the lead?
445	00:33:48	00:33:49	Well, that's police business.
446	00:33:49	00:33:52	Really don't want to compromise the investigation.
447	00:33:52	00:33:57	Sure. Um, well, I'm working on a story for a big national news magazine.
448	00:33:57	00:34:01	Think a $100 latte might be the fix I need?
449	00:34:03	00:34:05	Hey, Lou, cover for me.
450	00:34:09	00:34:13	The key with a killer like Jekyll is to put yourself into his twisted mindset.
451	00:34:13	00:34:14	It's a chess game, really.
452	00:34:15	00:34:22	Every move Jekyll makes is calculated, and guys like Langston and I have to anticipate his deadly gambits.
453	00:34:23	00:34:27	Location like this fits my profile of Jekyll.
454	00:34:27	00:34:32	I'm thinking there may be a secret passageway to an underground operating room.
455	00:34:32	00:34:34	(gasps) Ow. Geez!
456	00:34:34	00:34:37	Toolbox just happened to fall on her head?
457	00:34:37	00:34:39	That's what happened. I swear.
458	00:34:39	00:34:43	So, tell me more about the secret passageway theory.
459	00:34:43	00:34:46	I'm not buying it, Mr. Grady.
460	00:34:46	00:34:48	And I don't think Heidi was, either.
461	00:34:48	00:34:55	I think Heidi realized that there was nothing in that building but a story and a pathetic little man who had spun it for some attention.
462	00:34:55	00:35:01	She called you out on it-- she humiliated you-- so you attacked her.
463	00:35:01	00:35:05	You smashed her head into that toolbox, grabbed her by the throat...
464	00:35:05	00:35:06	No.
465	00:35:07	00:35:09	No. No.
466	00:35:09	00:35:11	Uh, no, no, no, no, no.
467	00:35:11	00:35:19	Okay, yeah, maybe she wasn't thrilled about the head wound and some of my theories, but I certainly did not touch her.
468	00:35:19	00:35:22	She gave me a ride back to the medical school.
469	00:35:22	00:35:23	She was alive when she dropped me off.
470	00:35:23	00:35:27	And I was not lying.
471	00:35:29	00:35:31	We never should have breached Jekyll's lair.
472	00:35:31	00:35:36	But we did-- he tasted her blood, he hunted her down, and he finished her.
473	00:35:36	00:35:38	Where's Dr. Langston?
474	00:35:38	00:35:40	Excuse me? I need to speak to Dr. Langston.
475	00:35:40	00:35:43	He understands the kind of criminal mastermind that we're after.
476	00:35:53	00:36:01	The palm print on the toolbox is Vince's, but the bloody print on Heidi's steering wheel is definitely not.
477	00:36:01	00:36:03	Still unknown.
478	00:36:03	00:36:06	Well, it's consistent with the goofball's story.
479	00:36:06	00:36:09	Guy's delusional, but I don't think he killed her.
480	00:36:09	00:36:11	And we don't have any other suspects.
481	00:36:11	00:36:13	But we do have another theory.
482	00:36:14	00:36:16	Langston's.
483	00:36:16	00:36:22	If Langston was right and he led Heidi to Jekyll, we might find him somewhere in this Blue Aces surveillance footage.
484	00:36:22	00:36:25	Well, I've looked through it all.
485	00:36:25	00:36:27	She didn't talk to anybody.
486	00:36:27	00:36:32	She just follows Langston through the casino, into the bar, and then out again.
487	00:36:32	00:36:38	Besides, aside from a guy playing keno in his bloody scrubs, how are we even going to be able to identify Jekyll?
488	00:36:38	00:36:41	Some random five-foot-ten white dude?
489	00:36:41	00:36:43	Check out this guy.
490	00:36:43	00:36:49	He's playing a penny machine near Langston and Heidi, but when they were on the other side of the casino...
491	00:36:51	00:36:55	...the same guy is playing ten dollar slots, and again right by the two of them.
492	00:36:55	00:36:59	Now, nobody who plays pennies starts yanking ten dollars a spin like that.
493	00:36:59	00:37:02	Well, maybe I can get some other angles on this guy.
494	00:37:02	00:37:08	Yeah, but first, give me a surveillance still of Jekyll from the St. Sebastian's Hospital supply room.
495	00:37:08	00:37:10	Biometric comparison?
496	00:37:10	00:37:11	Yeah, exactly.
497	00:37:11	00:37:13	All right.
498	00:37:27	00:37:35	So, Heidi's following Langston and Jekyll is following one-- or both-- of them.
499	00:37:35	00:37:36	Yep.
500	00:37:36	00:37:42	And somewhere along the way, Heidi meets Jekyll, and he kills her.
501	00:37:42	00:37:44	Okay.
502	00:37:44	00:37:46	There are no more angles on this guy. No.
503	00:37:47	00:37:49	He's good. He ducks the cameras.
504	00:37:52	00:37:54	Hey, Jim.
505	00:37:54	00:37:59	So, we picked up a guy who was trying to pawn Heidi Custer's amber pendant, and her laptop and camera.
506	00:37:59	00:38:03	And his print matches the bloody print we found on the rental car.
507	00:38:03	00:38:05	Jim, it's got to be him-- Dr. Jekyll.
508	00:38:05	00:38:07	No, this kid is no Doogie Howser.
509	00:38:07	00:38:09	Been spilling his guts for the past two hours.
510	00:38:09	00:38:11	Name is Lou Brennan.
511	00:38:11	00:38:18	He's a busboy at the loony-tune coffeemaker Vince's place, and he was tweaked on more than a macchiato.
512	00:38:18	00:38:22	Said he saw Heidi talking to Vincent at the coffee stand.
513	00:38:22	00:38:25	Well, I'm working on a story for a big national news magazine.
514	00:38:25	00:38:27	Saw her flashing a lot of green.
515	00:38:27	00:38:29	Think a $100 latte might be the fix I need?
516	00:38:32	00:38:35	After Lou closed up, he waited for Heidi and Vince to come back.
517	00:38:36	00:38:38	What the hell?
518	00:38:38	00:38:40	Heard you give money to people who know stuff.
519	00:38:40	00:38:43	I know stuff about all kinds of stuff. You know what?
520	00:38:43	00:38:46	I have had a belly full of crap from losers today.
521	00:38:46	00:38:48	I am not giving you any money.
522	00:38:48	00:38:50	You don't think I know stuff?
523	00:38:51	00:38:54	You mop the floors for a guy who knows nothing, so no.
524	00:38:54	00:38:56	Now, get out of my car.
525	00:39:13	00:39:19	Claims he didn't mean to kill her, just accidentally strangled her for four and a half minutes.
526	00:39:22	00:39:25	Then, had to get rid of his mess.
527	00:39:34	00:39:37	So, Heidi's murder had nothing to do with Dr. Jekyll.
528	00:39:37	00:39:39	It was a simple crime of opportunity.
529	00:39:39	00:39:46	My big question is, if Jekyll wasn't after Heidi, what was he doing at the Blue Aces?
530	00:39:47	00:39:48	He was following me.
531	00:39:55	00:39:57	The man stole my I.D. badge.
532	00:39:57	00:39:58	He knows my face.
533	00:39:59	00:40:03	He could have followed me from the lab to that casino.
534	00:40:09	00:40:12	He could have followed me home.
535	00:40:12	00:40:14	He could have followed me here.
536	00:40:16	00:40:19	I can talk to Brass to get a protection detail for you.
537	00:40:21	00:40:24	You should think about wearing a gun again.
538	00:40:24	00:40:26	Jekyll's had plenty of opportunities to hurt me.
539	00:40:26	00:40:28	I don't think that's what he wants.
540	00:40:28	00:40:30	Don't be so sure.
541	00:40:30	00:40:33	Jekyll's meticulous, takes his time.
542	00:40:33	00:40:36	He might be planning something special for you.
543	00:40:38	00:40:40	Thanks.
544	00:40:40	00:40:42	Excuse me.
545	00:40:43	00:40:45	This is Langston.
546	00:40:46	00:40:48	It's been a while, Professor.
547	00:40:48	00:40:49	Who is this?
548	00:40:51	00:40:54	Did I come up on your phone as unknown?
549	00:40:54	00:40:57	And you answered anyway.
550	00:40:57	00:41:01	It's nice to know you haven't lost your faith in your fellow man.
551	00:41:03	00:41:06	How's the real world been treating you?
552	00:41:06	00:41:10	Ever get nostalgic for our school days?
553	00:41:11	00:41:12	Nate Haskell.
554	00:41:12	00:41:14	That's right.
555	00:41:14	00:41:18	Your favorite serial killer.
556	00:41:18	00:41:21	I'm calling with an exciting limited-time offer.
557	00:41:21	00:41:23	What do you want, Nate?
558	00:41:23	00:41:26	That's the wrong question, Professor.
559	00:41:26	00:41:28	This isn't about what I want.
560	00:41:28	00:41:30	This is about what you want.
561	00:41:30	00:41:34	Or rather... who you want.
562	00:41:34	00:41:37	I know who Dr. Jekyll is.
