0	00:00:35	00:00:37	Animal predation.
1	00:00:37	00:00:39	Coyotes.
2	00:00:39	00:00:42	Plenty of them out here, but I didn't see any when I spotted the body from the road.
3	00:00:42	00:00:45	There's no vital response in the wounds, so the feast was postmortem.
4	00:00:45	00:00:48	And they had plenty of time to chow down.
5	00:00:48	00:00:51	Body temp places TOD four to eight hours ago.
6	00:00:51	00:00:56	Hey, did you know that coyotes won't eat the flesh of crystal meth users? Really?
7	00:00:56	00:00:57	It's true. It's true.
8	00:00:57	00:00:59	I read it. They can sense that the stuff is poison.
9	00:00:59	00:01:04	Well, that places them at a higher evolutionary mark than a good deal of human beings.
10	00:01:14	00:01:15	What you got, Ray?
11	00:01:15	00:01:19	Looks like a nylon bag with some bits of Styrofoam.
12	00:01:19	00:01:21	I'll get it to Hodges.
13	00:01:21	00:01:24	There's no wallet, there's no I.D.
14	00:01:24	00:01:26	Just his keys.
15	00:01:26	00:01:27	Anything printed on the keychain?
16	00:01:27	00:01:30	If found eaten by animals, please call...
17	00:01:30	00:01:31	David.
18	00:01:31	00:01:33	Sorry. Ink's worn off.
19	00:01:37	00:01:38	Can you help me roll him?
20	00:01:38	00:01:40	Sure.
21	00:01:51	00:01:53	Multiple puncture wounds to the abdomen.
22	00:01:53	00:01:54	Bullet wounds?
23	00:01:55	00:01:57	Look at the spacing of the wounds.
24	00:01:57	00:02:00	What do you notice?
25	00:02:00	00:02:01	Well, they're uniform.
26	00:02:01	00:02:04	That's right. They're uniform.
27	00:02:04	00:02:05	So what are you thinking?
28	00:02:05	00:02:08	The regular spacing, the curvilinear pattern of the punctures...
29	00:02:08	00:02:11	This is what you would expect from a bite mark.
30	00:02:11	00:02:13	A bite mark.
31	00:02:13	00:02:15	From what?
32	00:02:16	00:02:18	Godzilla.
33	00:02:56	00:03:03	Whatever monster is loose in Vegas, this so-called bite wasn't what killed your Desert Doe.
34	00:03:03	00:03:11	COD was diffuse axonal injury of the brain, typically caused by the sudden deceleration associated with a car crash, or a significant fall.
35	00:03:11	00:03:14	Body stops, brain has momentum, bad things happen.
36	00:03:14	00:03:24	As for the, uh, puncturing implements, they perforated the skin, subcutaneous fat, abdominal muscle, and the peritoneum.
37	00:03:24	00:03:26	And they were each at least three inches long.
38	00:03:26	00:03:30	And approximately an inch wide, based on the abrasion rings around the wounds.
39	00:03:30	00:03:37	Anything with teeth and jaws that size has been extinct for... 65 million years?
40	00:03:37	00:03:41	True. Uh, that is, for the past 64 million years and 51 weeks.
41	00:03:41	00:03:43	However, not this week.
42	00:03:43	00:03:46	The cloth bag that you found with the little white balls?
43	00:03:46	00:03:52	The bag is made of custom spandex, the balls are expanded polystyrene foam.
44	00:03:52	00:04:00	Both, I discovered, are components used by an Australian-based entertainment company to construct... simulated muscle.
45	00:04:03	00:04:05	Simulated muscle for what?
46	00:04:05	00:04:12	For possibly the coolest thing I've ever heard of, which has been residing at the Las Vegas Arena for the past week, and please, can we just go now?
47	00:04:12	00:04:15	Please. Go now.
48	00:05:09	00:05:12	Stokes? Sanders?
49	00:05:12	00:05:13	Detective Reed.
50	00:05:13	00:05:16	Gardener spotted him through the window.
51	00:05:16	00:05:18	Meet Phil Kohler.
52	00:05:18	00:05:23	His card says Investment Strategist, the hole in his head says exit strategy.
53	00:05:23	00:05:26	Body temp indicates TOD was sometime last night.
54	00:05:26	00:05:32	We didn't find a note, so no telling what torments of finance or fairway drove this country clubber to cash out.
55	00:05:34	00:05:36	His daughter was murdered.
56	00:05:36	00:05:38	Excuse me?
57	00:05:38	00:05:39	Oh, that's right.
58	00:05:39	00:05:41	Whitney Kohler.
59	00:05:41	00:05:42	Five years ago.
60	00:05:42	00:05:45	She and her best friend, Rachel Beck, they were 15.
61	00:05:45	00:05:48	Went to the mall together one day, never came back.
62	00:05:48	00:05:53	Couple of days later, we found Whitney's blood in a suspect's van.
63	00:05:53	00:05:55	He's now serving life, but the bodies were never found.
64	00:06:03	00:06:06	Yeah, I met Phil a couple of times.
65	00:06:07	00:06:09	He and his wife. Sharon.
66	00:06:10	00:06:13	Divorce papers.
67	00:06:16	00:06:18	No stellate tearing around the wound.
68	00:06:20	00:06:25	Random powder particles dispersed all over his face.
69	00:06:25	00:06:29	So the gun had to have been held at least a foot or two away from his head.
70	00:06:29	00:06:31	It's unusual for suicide.
71	00:06:35	00:06:40	Looks like he had some brunette company.
72	00:06:40	00:06:43	I don't see his wife in any of these photos, but...
73	00:06:43	00:06:44	I think she was a brunette.
74	00:06:44	00:06:47	We've got possible signs of a struggle.
75	00:06:58	00:07:02	Phil has the same gold watch on in every picture.
76	00:07:06	00:07:08	Well, he's not wearing it now.
77	00:07:08	00:07:10	Okay.
78	00:07:10	00:07:14	I'm going to have a look around the house, see what else was taken from this guy.
79	00:07:18	00:07:20	I bought that watch for Phil 20 years ago.
80	00:07:20	00:07:26	Waddled into the jewelry store nine months pregnant, maxing out the credit card.
81	00:07:26	00:07:28	Phil was going to be a father.
82	00:07:28	00:07:33	What does the watch have to do with what happened to Phil?
83	00:07:33	00:07:35	We didn't find it in his house.
84	00:07:35	00:07:39	And it's listed among the disputed possessions in your divorce paperwork.
85	00:07:39	00:07:44	I have no idea what happened to Phil, or his watch.
86	00:07:44	00:07:46	I haven't spoken to him in months.
87	00:07:46	00:07:53	Ms. Kohler, you listed adultery as the grounds when you filed for divorce.
88	00:07:53	00:07:56	Do you have names of any other women in Phil's life?
89	00:07:56	00:07:59	Just one.
90	00:07:59	00:08:00	Carly Beck.
91	00:08:00	00:08:02	You mean...
92	00:08:02	00:08:06	the mother of the other missing girl?
93	00:08:06	00:08:08	Rachel's mom?
94	00:08:08	00:08:11	Yeah.
95	00:08:11	00:08:14	I walked in on them six months ago.
96	00:08:14	00:08:16	Shared grief, Phil called it.
97	00:08:18	00:08:21	Who knew grief could push two people together?
98	00:08:21	00:08:24	I'd only seen it tear everything apart.
99	00:08:26	00:08:30	Using the Glock that killed Phil Kohler, I fired a distance determination pattern.
100	00:08:30	00:08:36	Found that the muzzle had to be between 36 to 48 inches from Kohler's forehead when fired.
101	00:08:36	00:08:39	His arm is only 30 inches long.
102	00:08:39	00:08:41	That's murder.
103	00:08:41	00:08:43	The gun's unregistered. Henry...
104	00:08:43	00:08:45	any luck on the mystery brunette?
105	00:08:45	00:08:47	Well, mystery no longer.
106	00:08:47	00:08:49	The hair was a maternal match to a known DNA profile.
107	00:08:49	00:08:52	And it wasn't the wife.
108	00:08:54	00:08:56	The hair's Carly Beck's.
109	00:09:01	00:09:05	Carly Beck, LVPD! Open the door!
110	00:09:09	00:09:12	Hey, so back at the vic's house-- my big mouth.
111	00:09:12	00:09:15	I didn't realize that you'd known the family.
112	00:09:15	00:09:17	Ah, it's okay. Don't worry about it.
113	00:09:17	00:09:20	'Cause I've been working on my sensitivity.
114	00:09:59	00:10:06	Missing daughter's room goes untouched for five years, but it's pretty obvious there's been a few items removed here recently.
115	00:10:06	00:10:08	Can you tell what?
116	00:10:08	00:10:10	There's a new package of photo paper there.
117	00:10:11	00:10:15	But I don't see a computer or printer anywhere.
118	00:10:30	00:10:33	Is that Carly's daughter?
119	00:10:33	00:10:35	I thought you said the body was never found.
120	00:10:35	00:10:37	We never found either one of the girls.
121	00:10:37	00:10:41	But Carly's daughter was wearing a gray sweatshirt when she went missing.
122	00:10:41	00:10:45	Whitney Kohler was the one wearing purple.
123	00:11:03	00:11:06	Welcome to Walking with Dinosaurs.
124	00:11:06	00:11:15	17 life-sized prehistoric beasts touring the world in a show that spans 180 million years in history in 90 minutes.
125	00:11:15	00:11:16	I'm the tour manager, Kyle Adams.
126	00:11:16	00:11:17	Ray Langston.
127	00:11:17	00:11:20	And this is David Hodges.
128	00:11:20	00:11:22	Now I heard you gentlemen are with the crime lab?
129	00:11:22	00:11:23	Yes.
130	00:11:23	00:11:25	How can I help you?
131	00:11:25	00:11:26	One of them ate a guy.
132	00:11:26	00:11:28	I'm sorry?
133	00:11:28	00:11:32	We found a victim who exhibited some, um, unique puncture wounds.
134	00:11:32	00:11:35	We think the injury may have occurred here.
135	00:11:35	00:11:37	Do you recognize this young man?
136	00:11:40	00:11:43	We'd like to examine some of the creatures' mouths.
137	00:11:43	00:11:46	We're also going to need to see a couple of them fight each other.
138	00:11:48	00:11:50	No, we're not.
139	00:11:52	00:11:53	Come on. Please?
140	00:11:53	00:11:54	Maybe just a little.
141	00:13:16	00:13:23	The blood from the T rex's mouth is definitely human, and its bottom teeth match the wounds on our victim.
142	00:13:23	00:13:25	That doesn't make sense.
143	00:13:25	00:13:28	It takes three people to operate the T rex.
144	00:13:28	00:13:35	A chassis driver, a remote operator to control major movements, and a second auxiliary operator.
145	00:13:35	00:13:40	And the T rex operators know everyone wants a chance to manipulate the big beast, so they lock their control rigs up after the show.
146	00:13:40	00:13:42	Nobody was in the arena after hours?
147	00:13:42	00:13:45	The entire crew went out for dinner, then back to our hotel.
148	00:13:45	00:13:46	Overnight security?
149	00:13:46	00:13:50	The place was supposed to be locked up, but I guess we were wrong.
150	00:13:50	00:13:53	(phone ringing) Excuse me.
151	00:13:53	00:13:54	This is Langston.
152	00:13:54	00:13:55	It's Henry.
153	00:13:55	00:13:57	I got an I.D. on your Dino Doe.
154	00:13:57	00:14:01	A Video Spec allowed me to recreate the text on the vic's keychain.
155	00:14:01	00:14:05	It's a logo of the WLVU paleontology program.
156	00:14:05	00:14:12	A professor I.D.'d the vic as Brian Lister, a student specializing in herbivorous dinosaurs.
157	00:14:12	00:14:14	Not a big fan of the predators.
158	00:14:14	00:14:15	I wonder why.
159	00:14:15	00:14:18	Anyway, his fiancée is another student in the program.
160	00:14:18	00:14:19	We're bringing her in.
161	00:14:19	00:14:21	Oh, if you need anything, let me know.
162	00:14:21	00:14:23	Hodges had to go home sick.
163	00:14:23	00:14:25	Sick?
164	00:14:35	00:14:39	We have a broadcast out on Carly Beck's vehicle.
165	00:14:39	00:14:41	No known employer.
166	00:14:41	00:14:43	What do we have from the photo?
167	00:14:43	00:14:47	Fingerprints on it belong to both Carly Beck and Phil Kohler.
168	00:14:47	00:14:52	The photo was printed on the same paper stock that Nick found in Carly's house.
169	00:14:52	00:14:54	Yeah, but there was no computer, printer or camera over there.
170	00:14:54	00:14:57	Could have been the items removed from her daughter's room.
171	00:14:57	00:15:01	Somehow she printed it; she brings it to Phil Kohler.
172	00:15:01	00:15:06	For some reason they struggle, Phil gets shot, Carly flees.
173	00:15:06	00:15:13	So if you bring a man a photo of his dead daughter, what are you trying to do, confront him?
174	00:15:13	00:15:15	Or extort him.
175	00:15:15	00:15:16	Stolen watch.
176	00:15:16	00:15:18	She may have been after money.
177	00:15:18	00:15:19	We don't know that.
178	00:15:21	00:15:27	if Carly Beck knows where Whitney's body is, does that mean she was involved in her death?
179	00:15:27	00:15:29	Eli Holt killed both of those girls.
180	00:15:29	00:15:30	Whitney's blood was in his van.
181	00:15:30	00:15:34	Mall surveillance has him circling the lot, approaching other girls.
182	00:15:34	00:15:36	But clearly, Carly has some information that we don't.
183	00:15:36	00:15:38	And she didn't share it with us.
184	00:15:38	00:15:40	You're right.
185	00:15:40	00:15:41	What about Carly's daughter Rachel?
186	00:15:41	00:15:47	If Carly knows where Whitney's buried, has she known this whole time where Rachel is?
187	00:15:47	00:15:51	No. No, I dealt with Carly back then, when her daughter went missing.
188	00:15:51	00:15:53	Everybody is talking about the other girl.
189	00:15:53	00:15:55	Those girls are best friends.
190	00:15:55	00:15:56	They went to the mall together.
191	00:15:56	00:15:58	That man took them both! Ms. Beck...
192	00:15:58	00:16:01	Why isn't anybody looking for my daughter?!
193	00:16:01	00:16:03	Because we're not the ones with money?!
194	00:16:03	00:16:05	Because we're not the ones who know people?!
195	00:16:05	00:16:11	No. Now, I go 110% on every case, but all I can work with is the evidence, and there's only evidence of Whitney in that man's van.
196	00:16:11	00:16:13	Listen, I'm doing everything I can, I promise...
197	00:16:13	00:16:15	That isn't enough!
198	00:16:16	00:16:21	I've analyzed the photo of Whitney Kohler.
199	00:16:21	00:16:26	The victim exhibits skeletonization and mummified tissue.
200	00:16:26	00:16:28	It's consistent with our hot, dry climate.
201	00:16:28	00:16:35	If she was killed five years ago, it's possible Whitney Kohler's been in this state of decomposition the past four and a half years.
202	00:16:35	00:16:38	The photo could have been taken any time in that span.
203	00:16:38	00:16:40	The entire time Holt's been in prison.
204	00:16:40	00:16:43	Holt could have told anyone where that body's buried.
205	00:16:43	00:16:45	A visitor, another inmate.
206	00:16:45	00:16:47	We got to go talk to him.
207	00:16:47	00:16:50	Well, Eli Holt's in a coma.
208	00:16:50	00:16:52	Attempted suicide ten days ago.
209	00:16:52	00:16:53	Why now?
210	00:16:53	00:16:54	What set him off? I don't know.
211	00:16:54	00:16:56	The prison guards certainly didn't have any idea.
212	00:16:56	00:17:00	But the prison sent over his communication record.
213	00:17:00	00:17:05	It turns out that Carly Beck was writing him a lot of letters.
214	00:17:05	00:17:06	But there's no indication that Holt ever responded.
215	00:17:06	00:17:11	Dear Mr. Holt, I'd do anything for you if you'd just tell me where my Rachel's body is?
216	00:17:11	00:17:13	Yeah, there's a lot of that.
217	00:17:13	00:17:16	Okay, help me figure this out.
218	00:17:16	00:17:19	Holt attempts suicide.
219	00:17:19	00:17:28	Ten days later, the father of one of his victims gets killed, after being shown a picture of his dead daughter by the other victim's mother.
220	00:17:28	00:17:31	Right.
221	00:17:31	00:17:33	What are we missing?
222	00:17:33	00:17:36	There was more to the picture of Whitney Kohler.
223	00:17:36	00:17:39	I enhanced a billboard in the distant background.
224	00:17:41	00:17:48	A rep for the advertising company told me that this real estate agent recently placed five of the same signs around Vegas.
225	00:17:48	00:17:50	Any in a rural location like the photo?
226	00:17:50	00:17:52	Just one.
227	00:17:52	00:17:56	On Highway 16, near mile marker 20.
228	00:17:56	00:18:06	I was thinking Nick and I can head out there, visually recreate the distance from and vantage of the billboard in the photo.
229	00:18:06	00:18:09	We might find something.
230	00:18:57	00:19:01	Based on her broken hyoid, C.O.D. was strangulation.
231	00:19:01	00:19:02	Mm-hmm.
232	00:19:02	00:19:06	But that wasn't all her killer did to her.
233	00:19:06	00:19:09	He severed two of her fingers, partially severed a third.
234	00:19:09	00:19:12	An abandoned attempt to obscure her identity.
235	00:19:12	00:19:14	Or she was tortured.
236	00:19:14	00:19:17	Well, whatever the twisted impetus, I can tell you the twisted implement.
237	00:19:17	00:19:22	Width of the kerf mark on the bone was approximately 30,000ths of an inch wide.
238	00:19:22	00:19:27	That correlates to a hacksaw or a band saw.
239	00:19:27	00:19:31	But the consistency and directionality of the cut has me leaning toward band saw.
240	00:19:31	00:19:33	Band saw's a heavy piece of equipment.
241	00:19:33	00:19:34	Fixed in one place.
242	00:19:34	00:19:38	Where could Holt have had access to a saw like that?
243	00:19:38	00:19:45	So no one was looking for a band saw five years ago, but I reinterviewed Eli Holt's cousins, and they told me about this place.
244	00:19:45	00:19:46	Belonged to Eli's Uncle Bill.
245	00:19:46	00:19:48	He died four years ago.
246	00:19:48	00:19:50	Went into probate, no takers.
247	00:19:50	00:19:52	Yeah, yeah, I interviewed the uncle during the investigation.
248	00:19:52	00:19:54	He was practically on his death bed.
249	00:19:54	00:19:56	Said he hadn't seen Eli in like ten years.
250	00:19:56	00:19:57	Family falling out.
251	00:19:57	00:20:01	But Eli used to come here as a kid, work with his uncle in the wood shop.
252	00:20:01	00:20:05	With his uncle sick, five years ago maybe Eli came back with some projects of his own.
253	00:20:45	00:20:48	And we've got a primary.
254	00:21:00	00:21:04	You think Uncle Bill had any idea what Eli was doing out here?
255	00:21:04	00:21:07	Just left all this evidence behind?
256	00:21:07	00:21:09	No, I doubt it.
257	00:21:09	00:21:13	He was probably sneaking his victims in at night.
258	00:21:13	00:21:20	Meant to come back and clean all this stuff up, but got caught before he could get around to it.
259	00:21:20	00:21:22	Yeah. Nobody's been out here since.
260	00:21:27	00:21:30	I remember when the girls first went missing.
261	00:21:30	00:21:32	It was one of my first weeks out in the field.
262	00:21:32	00:21:37	It wasn't even my case, but I felt like I should have been doing something more to help.
263	00:21:37	00:21:43	Yeah, well, some cases it never feels like you're doing enough.
264	00:21:44	00:21:48	These tools are ancient, except for this shovel.
265	00:21:48	00:21:50	It's got a fiberglass handle.
266	00:21:50	00:21:53	Holt could have purchased it to bury Whitney.
267	00:22:07	00:22:09	And Rachel, too.
268	00:22:20	00:22:26	Brian was so excited to take me to Walking with Dinosaurs last night.
269	00:22:26	00:22:27	And the show was amazing.
270	00:22:27	00:22:31	Just to see our beloved Brachiosaurus come to life.
271	00:22:33	00:22:39	With its long and graceful neck and its gentle energy.
272	00:22:39	00:22:41	What happened after the show?
273	00:22:41	00:22:45	Brian took me back to my dorm.
274	00:22:45	00:22:48	And that's the last I saw of him.
275	00:22:48	00:22:51	But we were going to build a life together.
276	00:22:51	00:22:55	We were going to travel the world, learning the lessons of the great leaf-eaters.
277	00:22:55	00:23:01	Jane, um, the crew from Walking with Dinosaurs sent over some video of last night's show.
278	00:23:01	00:23:04	I was able to find you and Brian in the crowd.
279	00:23:04	00:23:06	Now...
280	00:23:06	00:23:10	you didn't mention this part of the evening.
281	00:23:10	00:23:13	Ladies and gentlemen, Tyrannosaurus rex!
282	00:23:14	00:23:16	I didn't think it was relevant.
283	00:23:19	00:23:21	Ladies and gentlemen, Tyrannosaurus rex!
284	00:23:23	00:23:26	I'm gonna go forage for some vegan concessions.
285	00:23:30	00:23:34	I couldn't take my eyes off that hideous beast.
286	00:23:34	00:23:35	Its obscene jawline.
287	00:23:35	00:23:37	Its throbbing musculature.
288	00:23:41	00:23:52	You know, the T rex was so active, so relentlessly physical, that it may have been one of the few dinos whose blood pumped... warm.
289	00:24:03	00:24:05	Who is this guy?
290	00:24:05	00:24:07	I don't know.
291	00:24:07	00:24:08	And it doesn't matter.
292	00:24:08	00:24:10	I was swallowed up by the carnivorous moment.
293	00:24:10	00:24:13	But it was just a moment.
294	00:24:13	00:24:19	Because Brian and the other long-necked herbivores-- those are my true loves.
295	00:24:23	00:24:26	Yeah...
296	00:24:26	00:24:29	22 pounds of bite force.
297	00:24:29	00:24:33	Same as the animatronic T rex's jaws.
298	00:24:35	00:24:37	So did you get this at the toy store or, uh...?
299	00:24:37	00:24:40	Actually, it's on loan from an old colleague at WLVU.
300	00:24:45	00:24:47	All right, let's see.
301	00:24:53	00:24:54	Barely wounded.
302	00:24:54	00:25:00	That means a bite from the T rex couldn't have caused Brian Lister's wounds.
303	00:25:01	00:25:07	But Brian's blood was in the mouth of the T rex, and the bottom teeth are a perfect match to his wounds.
304	00:25:07	00:25:11	All right, so if the creature couldn't have bitten Brian with sufficient force, then...
305	00:25:11	00:25:15	It was staged or additional force would have had to have come from somewhere else.
306	00:25:17	00:25:20	Let's say that Brian supplied the additional force.
307	00:25:20	00:25:21	He brought the momentum to the monster.
308	00:25:21	00:25:22	Correct.
309	00:25:22	00:25:26	Doc Robbins said his brain injuries were consistent with a fall.
310	00:25:26	00:25:33	And since his back was scavenged, we don't actually know if he had any injuries on his back from the upper teeth.
311	00:25:33	00:25:35	He may have simply fallen onto the lower teeth.
312	00:25:35	00:25:40	Well, if that's the case, then he would've fallen from some great height.
313	00:25:57	00:26:02	These are the parked positions of the dinosaurs in which they stand overnight.
314	00:26:13	00:26:15	Got some fibers in her lip.
315	00:26:18	00:26:21	It's the same blue and yellow from our victim's shirt.
316	00:26:21	00:26:22	How could he have gotten up there?
317	00:26:22	00:26:24	Same way I did.
318	00:26:24	00:26:33	If Brian snuck in, and the crane was here, fall from this height certainly would've gotten the job done.
319	00:26:35	00:26:37	what made him fall?
320	00:26:41	00:26:43	Phil Kohler's watch.
321	00:26:43	00:26:45	Got a hit on the pawnshop registry.
322	00:26:45	00:26:51	Shop owner said he bought it off a lady around noon, confirmed that it was Carly Beck off of a photo.
323	00:26:53	00:26:54	How much money did he give her?
324	00:26:54	00:26:56	1,500 bucks for the watch.
325	00:26:56	00:26:58	He also said she came in a week ago.
326	00:26:58	00:27:00	Sold him five G's worth of stuff.
327	00:27:00	00:27:02	A truck and all this junk.
328	00:27:02	00:27:06	This has got to be from Rachel's bedroom.
329	00:27:08	00:27:13	Scavenging through her dead daughter's room, blowing through five grand in a week and coming back for more?
330	00:27:13	00:27:14	What is Carly Beck into?
331	00:27:14	00:27:15	She brought something else in today.
332	00:27:15	00:27:16	Camera.
333	00:27:18	00:27:23	Pawnbroker said that she was begging him to buy an old computer, printer and her car, too, but he passed.
334	00:27:23	00:27:24	Car? You should...
335	00:27:24	00:27:29	I've already got calls going out to used car dealers in the area, seeing if she's trying to unload it.
336	00:27:33	00:27:36	She ditched the memory card.
337	00:27:36	00:27:38	Everything must go.
338	00:27:42	00:27:45	Catherine, I got the DNA results from the wood shop.
339	00:27:45	00:27:49	The blood contributions were from both girls, on the saw and on the floor.
340	00:27:49	00:27:51	Okay. Well, we just got a hit on Carly Beck's vehicle.
341	00:27:51	00:27:56	She sold it 15 minutes ago to a used car lot for cash and then just walked away from the lot.
342	00:27:56	00:27:58	Well, she couldn't have gotten that far on foot.
343	00:27:58	00:27:59	Patrol's canvassing the area.
344	00:28:27	00:28:28	Police!
345	00:28:28	00:28:30	It's my last chance!
346	00:28:37	00:28:39	It's my last chance!
347	00:28:39	00:28:41	It's okay, ma'am.
348	00:28:42	00:28:44	It's all right, ma'am.
349	00:28:44	00:28:47	It's my last chance!
350	00:29:02	00:29:04	I didn't kill Phil Kohler.
351	00:29:04	00:29:06	Come on, you were with him.
352	00:29:06	00:29:07	You ripped off his watch.
353	00:29:07	00:29:09	Come on.
354	00:29:09	00:29:10	That's not what...
355	00:29:10	00:29:11	I-I didn't kill him.
356	00:29:11	00:29:13	You know me.
357	00:29:13	00:29:15	I do.
358	00:29:15	00:29:17	Tell us about the letter, Carly.
359	00:29:19	00:29:25	I'd been writing to Eli Holt, begging him to tell me where my daughter was.
360	00:29:25	00:29:28	And for the first time ever, he wrote back.
361	00:29:28	00:29:34	He said he remembered where the girls were buried, but he didn't remember which girl was in which grave.
362	00:29:34	00:29:37	He'd sell me the maps.
363	00:29:37	00:29:38	$5,000 for one map.
364	00:29:38	00:29:40	$10,000 for both.
365	00:29:40	00:29:43	If I told the cops, the deal was off.
366	00:29:43	00:29:44	I'd never find her.
367	00:29:46	00:29:49	You pawned everything you could to get enough for one map.
368	00:29:49	00:29:51	But it was the wrong one, wasn't it?
369	00:29:59	00:30:03	When my Rachel went missing, she was wearing a gray sweatshirt.
370	00:30:03	00:30:06	Whitney was the one wearing purple.
371	00:30:06	00:30:07	You snapped photos of her body.
372	00:30:07	00:30:09	You left her out there in the desert.
373	00:30:09	00:30:11	What, you just didn't think to tell anybody?
374	00:30:11	00:30:12	I told Phil.
375	00:30:12	00:30:13	I don't know what you're doing here.
376	00:30:13	00:30:15	I can't see you anymore. It's about the girls!
377	00:30:15	00:30:18	It always is. But you and I need to move on with our lives, and that's not gonna happen.
378	00:30:18	00:30:20	I know where Whitney's buried.
379	00:30:20	00:30:22	I-I just need $5,000, and then I can find Rachel, too.
380	00:30:22	00:30:26	I just, I thought you could lend me the money, and then we'd both have our girls! Carly, Carly!
381	00:30:26	00:30:27	Whoever's telling you that is lying to you.
382	00:30:27	00:30:29	You know how many false leads we've gotten.
383	00:30:29	00:30:31	They're just preying on you.
384	00:30:31	00:30:32	No, it's... No, it's real, Phil!
385	00:30:34	00:30:36	I just need the money.
386	00:30:36	00:30:38	It's just another scam.
387	00:30:38	00:30:39	I'm calling the police.
388	00:30:39	00:30:41	No! No, no.
389	00:30:41	00:30:43	Don't call the police!
390	00:30:45	00:30:48	You're just going to get your heart broken again.
391	00:30:50	00:30:52	Get what you can for it.
392	00:30:53	00:30:56	Because I can't do this anymore.
393	00:30:58	00:31:01	And all this happened the night before Phil was killed?
394	00:31:01	00:31:04	After Phil's, I went home.
395	00:31:04	00:31:05	The phone rang.
396	00:31:05	00:31:07	I'm a friend of Eli's.
397	00:31:07	00:31:09	Want to know how the map worked out.
398	00:31:09	00:31:10	It wasn't my daughter.
399	00:31:10	00:31:12	I want to know where my daughter is.
400	00:31:12	00:31:14	Eli told you the deal.
401	00:31:14	00:31:15	It's five K.
402	00:31:15	00:31:17	Same locker at the park.
403	00:31:17	00:31:19	Sunset Friday or the deal's killed.
404	00:31:19	00:31:22	I can't get another $5,000.
405	00:31:22	00:31:23	I-I went to Whitney's dad.
406	00:31:23	00:31:26	He-He didn't believe me; he thinks it's a scam.
407	00:31:26	00:31:28	But I know it's not.
408	00:31:30	00:31:33	Hello? Hello?
409	00:31:37	00:31:40	Honey, Whitney's here.
410	00:31:40	00:31:41	You going to the mall?
411	00:31:47	00:31:52	Please, just get that monster to tell me where my daughter is.
412	00:31:52	00:31:54	When'd you get the first map?
413	00:31:56	00:31:58	Holt sent it to me three days ago.
414	00:32:04	00:32:07	Eli Holt has been in a coma for ten days.
415	00:32:10	00:32:14	Then who have I been talking to?
416	00:32:14	00:32:16	Who knows where my daughter is?
417	00:32:25	00:32:29	Of course, it's a little more primal when you're perfect strangers.
418	00:32:33	00:32:40	But when you use your credit card to pay for your ticket, you don't remain a stranger to us, not for very long.
419	00:32:40	00:32:44	Travis Kilborn, seat 42A.
420	00:32:44	00:32:48	And, of course, you knew Jane Lewis long before that enchanted prehistoric evening.
421	00:32:48	00:32:53	You both attend the same college paleontology program with only 12 other students.
422	00:32:53	00:32:54	You lied to me, Jane.
423	00:32:56	00:32:58	So here's what we have.
424	00:32:58	00:32:59	We have dirt in the tires of your car.
425	00:32:59	00:33:01	We have blood in the backseat.
426	00:33:01	00:33:03	We have your prints on the Brachiosaurus controls.
427	00:33:03	00:33:05	So which one of you is going to tell me what happened?
428	00:33:09	00:33:11	One of you had better speak up.
429	00:33:14	00:33:15	Brian just wanted a picture.
430	00:33:18	00:33:20	The three of us went to the show.
431	00:33:20	00:33:26	Had a few drinks afterwards, and thought it'd be cool to sneak back into the arena.
432	00:33:26	00:33:30	You guys, I need a picture with the Brachiosaurus.
433	00:33:31	00:33:33	Jane, bring it closer.
434	00:33:34	00:33:36	Closer.
435	00:33:36	00:33:38	Move it!
436	00:33:39	00:33:41	This is awesome.
437	00:33:41	00:33:42	Closer, closer, closer.
438	00:33:42	00:33:43	It was an accident.
439	00:33:43	00:33:45	Take a picture.
440	00:33:45	00:33:47	Closer. Closer.
441	00:33:47	00:33:48	Closer, closer, closer.
442	00:33:48	00:33:50	Little bit more.
443	00:33:55	00:33:58	He was still alive.
444	00:33:58	00:34:02	Pushed himself off the teeth, then fell all the way to the floor.
445	00:34:02	00:34:04	Brian!
446	00:34:04	00:34:06	Brian.
447	00:34:17	00:34:20	Oh, God.
448	00:34:23	00:34:25	Here. Here.
449	00:34:25	00:34:27	Put this on him.
450	00:34:27	00:34:29	All right.
451	00:34:29	00:34:30	All right, put this over him.
452	00:34:30	00:34:32	Put this over him! Yeah...
453	00:34:35	00:34:37	He was my friend.
454	00:34:37	00:34:39	Then why not call 911?
455	00:34:39	00:34:40	Why dump the body?
456	00:34:42	00:34:44	I panicked.
457	00:34:44	00:34:46	I thought we'd be in trouble.
458	00:34:46	00:34:50	I know it was an accident, but we were trespassing.
459	00:34:50	00:34:52	I'm sorry.
460	00:34:52	00:34:56	We found one other thing in your car.
461	00:34:56	00:35:01	A burger wrapper with lipstick on it.
462	00:35:01	00:35:05	We, uh, stopped at a place after we left the desert.
463	00:35:05	00:35:07	Jane was starving.
464	00:35:07	00:35:10	For red meat.
465	00:35:11	00:35:14	They were out of veggie burgers.
466	00:35:14	00:35:21	Jane, are you sure you accidentally knocked Brian out of the crane, or was a future with him simply not going to satisfy your appetite?
467	00:35:24	00:35:26	I want a lawyer.
468	00:35:29	00:35:36	So the mail room confirmed that the Holt letter and map was stamped with their postage machine, but the postmark indicates that it was sent from outside the prison.
469	00:35:36	00:35:39	Well, probably avoiding the prison mail screening.
470	00:35:39	00:35:42	The handwriting on the documents doesn't even match Holt's.
471	00:35:42	00:35:45	You know, he could have told another inmate where the bodies are buried.
472	00:35:45	00:35:47	Maybe they're trying to cash in.
473	00:35:47	00:35:50	Well, the CO supervisor says that Holt wasn't a talker.
474	00:35:50	00:35:52	He kept to himself, mostly.
475	00:35:52	00:35:54	Open that up, will you?
476	00:35:59	00:36:00	(sighs) He have any visitors?
477	00:36:00	00:36:03	No, no. No visitors.
478	00:36:03	00:36:09	Apparently, the most exciting day of his week was his, uh, tripto the canteen.
479	00:36:09	00:36:10	Oh, yeah?
480	00:36:14	00:36:16	What did he buy there?
481	00:36:21	00:36:26	couple of candy bars, bottle of soda and a notepad.
482	00:36:28	00:36:31	Well, here's a yellow notepad.
483	00:36:36	00:36:38	It looks like the top three sheets are missing.
484	00:36:38	00:36:43	So he buys a notepad on the morning of the day he tries to kill himself?
485	00:36:43	00:36:46	And what kind of guy writes a three-page suicide note?
486	00:36:46	00:36:48	You can get that done with one sheet.
487	00:36:48	00:36:51	Okay, so a note and two maps.
488	00:36:51	00:36:56	Well, according to the, uh, responding officer, Jason Richter, there was no suicide note.
489	00:36:56	00:36:59	Was the officer alone when he responded?
490	00:36:59	00:37:00	That's a confirm.
491	00:37:00	00:37:02	We better go round him up.
492	00:37:09	00:37:11	Jason Richter!
493	00:37:11	00:37:13	LVPD. Open up.
494	00:37:14	00:37:16	Take the back.
495	00:37:29	00:37:31	Hey! Hey!
496	00:37:37	00:37:40	Get down, or I will end you.
497	00:37:46	00:37:47	It's the second map!
498	00:37:54	00:37:59	12 bucks an hour to have everything that comes out of those animals flung at me?
499	00:38:03	00:38:07	I shouldn't have been so quick to help him.
500	00:38:20	00:38:22	I thought the maps might be to some buried loot.
501	00:38:38	00:38:41	Requesting rush medical to cell 105.
502	00:38:42	00:38:47	You knew those maps led to two dead children, and you still found a way to make a buck.
503	00:38:48	00:38:52	It was just that lady's crap luck the first map wasn't her daughter.
504	00:38:52	00:38:57	Hey... Holt's note didn't say which map was which.
505	00:39:00	00:39:02	I gave her a fair shot at it.
506	00:39:02	00:39:04	A fair shot?
507	00:39:04	00:39:07	You took Carly Beck for five grand.
508	00:39:07	00:39:09	I can't get another $5,000.
509	00:39:09	00:39:11	I-I-I went to Whitney's dad.
510	00:39:11	00:39:14	He... he didn't believe me; he thinks it's a scam.
511	00:39:14	00:39:16	You knew she wouldn't tell.
512	00:39:16	00:39:20	You couldn't be so sure about Phil Kohler.
513	00:39:22	00:39:25	So you had to silence him.
514	00:39:33	00:39:35	Who the hell are you?
515	00:39:46	00:39:54	The time you spent burning that lady's last chance to find her daughter, you should have spent burning your shirt.
516	00:39:54	00:39:59	We found it in your crawl space with Phil Kohler's blood on it.
517	00:40:00	00:40:02	That puts the gun in your hand.
518	00:40:23	00:40:30	I bet you're wondering how a guy with so many maps in front of him can be so damn lost.
519	00:40:30	00:40:33	Well, I think I can help you find your way.
520	00:40:33	00:40:36	Hodges analyzed the shovel you found at the primary.
521	00:40:36	00:40:46	Found something interesting lodged between the blade and the handle-- a clump of Bermuda grass seed, with trace of fertilizer, a tackifier and green dye.
522	00:40:46	00:40:52	Now, that particular formula was unique to only one hydro-seeding company that was operating five years ago.
523	00:40:52	00:40:58	So I went and got a list of all the projects they were working on around the time of Rachel Beck's disappearance.
524	00:40:58	00:41:06	One of those locations was the intersection of Briarwood Road and Lowell Road.
