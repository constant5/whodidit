0	00:00:27	00:00:29	The vic is Ross Neddy. Ex-con.
1	00:00:29	00:00:32	Spent a couple years in Jean for domestic assault.
2	00:00:32	00:00:33	Just got paroled.
3	00:00:33	00:00:37	Shop foreman says he's only been working here a few days.
4	00:00:37	00:00:40	Out of the frying pan into the fire.
5	00:00:40	00:00:41	He is a crispy critter.
6	00:00:41	00:00:44	I'd say the point of origin was him.
7	00:00:44	00:00:46	He should have stayed in prison.
8	00:00:46	00:00:48	Mmm-hmm.
9	00:00:49	00:00:51	Sloppy shop.
10	00:00:51	00:00:53	This whole place is a fire hazard.
11	00:00:53	00:00:56	Okay if I move him out?
12	00:00:56	00:00:58	Yeah, he's all yours, Super Dave.
13	00:01:01	00:01:03	There was a lot of gasoline over here.
14	00:01:03	00:01:06	Which explains this V-pattern.
15	00:01:06	00:01:08	Accelerant, a second point of origin.
16	00:01:08	00:01:10	Most likely arson.
17	00:01:10	00:01:11	Ex-con.
18	00:01:11	00:01:13	Enemies on the outside...
19	00:01:13	00:01:14	two points of origin...
20	00:01:14	00:01:16	maybe we're looking at a little payback.
21	00:01:16	00:01:19	What do you think, Keppler?
22	00:01:19	00:01:21	I think I'd better head back to the body.
23	00:01:21	00:01:24	Hey...
24	00:01:24	00:01:27	you know what Grissom would say here, don't you?
25	00:01:27	00:01:28	Something ironic, I'm sure.
26	00:01:47	00:01:49	Looks like somebody took a staple gun to him.
27	00:01:57	00:01:59	Those aren't bones.
28	00:02:33	00:02:36	That's bad luck, isn't it?
29	00:03:08	00:03:13	PVC piping is sometimes used to replace bones that have been donated for transplants.
30	00:03:13	00:03:15	So that the body looks right at open casket?
31	00:03:15	00:03:17	Right.
32	00:03:17	00:03:19	They use umbrellas and broomsticks for that, too?
33	00:03:19	00:03:21	Not that I've seen.
34	00:03:21	00:03:24	Wait a minute, they killed the guy and torched him; there's no open casket.
35	00:03:24	00:03:26	What's the point of stuffing the body?
36	00:03:26	00:03:27	Looks like the long bones are gone...
37	00:03:27	00:03:29	ditto for the spine...
38	00:03:29	00:03:31	tendons and cartilage...
39	00:03:31	00:03:33	most major veins... phew.
40	00:03:33	00:03:35	They took the heart valves, too.
41	00:03:35	00:03:44	So somebody murders an ex-con, then commits arson to make it look like an accident just so that they can harvest his bones and tissues?
42	00:03:44	00:03:50	That's big business-- disc replacement, joint replacement, bypasses, more demand than supply.
43	00:03:50	00:03:53	Why leave the kidneys, the heart and the liver?
44	00:03:53	00:03:55	They're worth big money, too.
45	00:03:55	00:03:57	Organ donation is heavily regulated.
46	00:03:57	00:03:59	Bone and tissue aren't.
47	00:03:59	00:04:02	At this point, indeterminate.
48	00:04:02	00:04:06	All I can say right now is based on the level of decomp, he's been dead at least a week.
49	00:04:06	00:04:09	You think I'm selling body parts?
50	00:04:09	00:04:10	Come on, you're wasting your time.
51	00:04:10	00:04:12	I sell refurbished engines.
52	00:04:12	00:04:14	I don't know jack about body parts.
53	00:04:14	00:04:16	No one's looking for a down-and-out ex-con.
54	00:04:16	00:04:18	It's less risky than drugs.
55	00:04:18	00:04:20	I hired Ross to weld metal together.
56	00:04:20	00:04:26	Even if I killed him-- not saying I did-- but if even if I did, I'd just burn the body as is, not re-pipe the guy.
57	00:04:26	00:04:28	And I definitely wouldn't burn him at work.
58	00:04:28	00:04:30	Fire station's a block away.
59	00:04:30	00:04:31	How do you know Ross?
60	00:04:31	00:04:33	You meet him in the joint?
61	00:04:33	00:04:40	I was out before he even went in. I picked Ross up with a bunch of other guys looking for work outside that big hardware store on Herrick four days ago.
62	00:04:40	00:04:41	When was the last time you saw him?
63	00:04:41	00:04:44	Four days ago. He'd been working nights.
64	00:04:44	00:04:46	Really?
65	00:04:46	00:04:48	'Cause the coroner said he's been dead at least a week.
66	00:04:48	00:04:50	You calling me a liar?
67	00:04:50	00:04:53	I'd believe a dead guy over an ex-con.
68	00:04:58	00:05:01	Living large. Mm.
69	00:05:01	00:05:03	Place this big in MacDonald Ranch-- what's the occupation?
70	00:05:03	00:05:05	That's, uh, Bill Norton.
71	00:05:05	00:05:06	You know, Dorton Homes.
72	00:05:06	00:05:08	Biggest homebuilder in town.
73	00:05:08	00:05:10	He built mine. Huh.
74	00:05:10	00:05:12	Oh, uh...
75	00:05:12	00:05:14	you'd better throw on some booties.
76	00:05:18	00:05:24	Margo Dorton, age 39. Her husband said he returned from a business trip and found her like this.
77	00:05:24	00:05:25	No sign of a forced entry.
78	00:05:26	00:05:30	My guys are gonna go talk to the neighbors, see what they say about their relationship.
79	00:05:30	00:05:31	What did he say?
80	00:05:31	00:05:35	According to him, it was a honeymoon every day.
81	00:05:37	00:05:39	Maybe...
82	00:05:39	00:05:41	she was having a honeymoon with someone else.
83	00:05:41	00:05:42	That'll be good motive for the husband.
84	00:05:42	00:05:44	There's a void here.
85	00:05:44	00:05:48	Maybe someone was sitting on the couch, or someone was sitting on the floor in front of the couch.
86	00:05:50	00:05:51	But then where's the someone else?
87	00:05:51	00:05:53	I mean, why kill her and not the lover?
88	00:05:53	00:05:57	Maybe the husband was the one having the honeymoon and the...
89	00:05:57	00:05:59	the wife walks in.
90	00:06:00	00:06:02	He kills her, tells his lover to beat it.
91	00:06:02	00:06:04	I'd buy it.
92	00:06:04	00:06:07	Unless the husband's alibi checks out.
93	00:06:07	00:06:09	Airport. I was coming home from the airport.
94	00:06:09	00:06:13	It's a business trip. Caught an early flight to surprise Margo.
95	00:06:13	00:06:15	I want your best cops on this.
96	00:06:15	00:06:18	I contributed a lot to this community. Absolutely.
97	00:06:18	00:06:19	Let's establish a timeline.
98	00:06:19	00:06:20	What time did your plane land?
99	00:06:20	00:06:25	30. 10 And you arrived here at... Midnight.
100	00:06:25	00:06:28	Well, it took you an hour and a half at that time of night to get from McKaren to here?
101	00:06:28	00:06:38	A half an hour waiting for baggage check, and half an hour to find my driver, and a half an hour to get home.
102	00:06:39	00:06:41	Look at this.
103	00:06:41	00:06:43	Valet ticket.
104	00:06:43	00:06:44	Nice purse. Nice dress.
105	00:06:44	00:06:47	Maybe safe to say she went out last night.
106	00:06:48	00:06:50	Maybe this will tell us where.
107	00:06:51	00:06:53	Maybe this...
108	00:06:53	00:06:57	will tell us who.
109	00:07:02	00:07:04	I'm gonna follow a little lead I got.
110	00:07:35	00:07:39	Well, I found a circular blood transfer in the bathroom about three inches in diameter.
111	00:07:41	00:07:43	Champagne bottle. Champagne bottle.
112	00:07:48	00:07:51	Looks like it's been wiped down.
113	00:07:51	00:07:53	Looks like we found our murder weapon.
114	00:08:31	00:08:33	So the crispy critter isn't Ross Neddy?
115	00:08:33	00:08:33	Nope.
116	00:08:33	00:08:35	Let me get this straight.
117	00:08:35	00:08:44	The ex-con digs up a corpse, scoops out a few body parts to sell, then fills it back up with PVC and umbrellas, then torches the body where he works to make it look like he's the victim?
118	00:08:44	00:08:46	Cops don't come looking for you if you're already dead.
119	00:08:46	00:08:50	If this Lapinsky guy was already dead, then how come the doc didn't find traces of embalming fluid?
120	00:08:50	00:08:52	He's Jewish. So what?
121	00:08:53	00:08:55	Observant Jews don't believe in embalming or donating organs.
122	00:08:55	00:08:56	It's part of their faith.
123	00:08:57	00:08:59	They think the body should go out the way it came in.
124	00:08:59	00:09:03	So, this isn't just about desecration of the body, but of the family as well. Mmm-hmm.
125	00:09:03	00:09:05	I'll get a court order for the exhumation.
126	00:09:57	00:09:58	What you got?
127	00:09:59	00:10:02	Well, looks like your killer wigged out on your vic.
128	00:10:04	00:10:08	The pink fiber's modacrylic with low birefringence.
129	00:10:08	00:10:10	Most likely made of elura.
130	00:10:10	00:10:11	Synthetic hair.
131	00:10:12	00:10:13	So much for DNA.
132	00:10:13	00:10:18	And the substance you found in the toilet-- if it looks like vomit and smells like vomit, it is.
133	00:10:18	00:10:23	The champagne glasses were negative for DNA, and Mandy found nothing but smears and partials on them.
134	00:10:23	00:10:26	And the blood from the champagne bottle just came back to the vic.
135	00:10:26	00:10:27	Any good news?
136	00:10:27	00:10:29	Well, I called the phone number on the valet stub.
137	00:10:29	00:10:31	It was a company called Chariot Parking.
138	00:10:31	00:10:34	They operate the parking lots at 30 restaurants and nightclubs.
139	00:10:34	00:10:35	Oh, well, that narrows it down.
140	00:10:35	00:10:36	Actually, it does.
141	00:10:36	00:10:42	The ticket on Margo Dorton's key ring came from a batch at the Over-Under Cabaret.
142	00:11:01	00:11:05	Excuse me, have you seen this man?
143	00:11:05	00:11:07	No. Thank you.
144	00:11:07	00:11:11	Ladies and gentlemen, get ready for tonight's panty auction!
145	00:11:16	00:11:17	Hello.
146	00:11:17	00:11:20	Have you seen this man?
147	00:11:22	00:11:30	For our first pair, starting at the low price of $50, Cotton Candy!
148	00:11:30	00:11:33	Doesn't accept checks, just cold, hard cash.
149	00:11:37	00:11:39	Check out the pink wig.
150	00:11:42	00:11:44	Bid!
151	00:11:51	00:11:52	Come on, come on.
152	00:11:53	00:11:54	Why you got to take the wig?
153	00:11:54	00:11:55	Wig's part of my act.
154	00:11:55	00:11:58	Y'all are straight stealing from me right now! Hello!
155	00:11:59	00:12:00	I'm crying for you.
156	00:12:00	00:12:01	Synthetic.
157	00:12:01	00:12:04	Same color and texture as the one that we collected off the vic.
158	00:12:04	00:12:06	Whoa, wh... Hey, hey, hey!
159	00:12:06	00:12:07	Look, look, look, look, look.
160	00:12:07	00:12:09	Look, we didn't even have sex, okay?
161	00:12:09	00:12:10	It was all touchy feely.
162	00:12:10	00:12:11	Jerky treats.
163	00:12:11	00:12:13	What are you talking about?
164	00:12:13	00:12:14	The guy I took into V.I.P. right before panty auction.
165	00:12:14	00:12:15	Look, man, all we did was touch.
166	00:12:16	00:12:17	Why do you think you're being arrested?
167	00:12:17	00:12:19	Solicitation, right?
168	00:12:19	00:12:21	No, actually.
169	00:12:21	00:12:23	We found this hair on this woman's dead body.
170	00:12:23	00:12:25	Margo?
171	00:12:26	00:12:27	She's dead?
172	00:12:27	00:12:30	And you think I killed her?
173	00:12:30	00:12:31	With or without the help of her husband.
174	00:12:31	00:12:32	No, no, no.
175	00:12:33	00:12:34	Look, man, I never seen dude in that picture.
176	00:12:35	00:12:39	And Margo, yeah, I'll admit, I slapped the ho around last night, but I didn't kill her.
177	00:12:39	00:12:40	You slapped her around?
178	00:12:40	00:12:42	She's always hanging out with my fiancé.
179	00:12:42	00:12:45	I couldn't take it anymore, so... yeah.
180	00:12:46	00:12:47	Bitch!
181	00:12:48	00:12:49	Get off of me!
182	00:12:50	00:12:51	No!
183	00:12:51	00:12:56	Why would Margo Dorton be hanging out here with your fiancé?
184	00:12:56	00:12:58	He works upstairs.
185	00:12:58	00:13:00	Upstairs?
186	00:13:00	00:13:04	Look, honey, they don't call this the Over-Under for nothing, all right?
187	00:13:04	00:13:05	What's your fiancé's name?
188	00:13:05	00:13:06	Jesse.
189	00:13:06	00:13:07	Take her downtown.
190	00:13:08	00:13:09	We're going upstairs.
191	00:13:09	00:13:10	Are you serious?
192	00:13:10	00:13:11	I didn't do anything.
193	00:13:12	00:13:13	Come on, man.
194	00:13:40	00:13:42	Is this a restaurant?
195	00:13:42	00:13:45	If it is, I'm scared of the menu.
196	00:13:46	00:13:49	The bus boy looks likes he's in charge of stocking the champagne.
197	00:13:50	00:13:51	I'm gonna have a word with him.
198	00:13:51	00:13:52	Okay.
199	00:13:52	00:13:56	Would you like a Meet Book or do you have a steady host?
200	00:13:56	00:13:58	Uh, actually, it's my first time.
201	00:13:58	00:14:00	What exactly goes on here?
202	00:14:00	00:14:03	This is a host club, a place where men entertain women.
203	00:14:03	00:14:05	It's the first of its kind in Las Vegas.
204	00:14:05	00:14:06	They started in Japan.
205	00:14:06	00:14:08	Take your pick.
206	00:14:08	00:14:10	Hosts get paid by the bottle.
207	00:14:10	00:14:12	There's a two bottle minimum.
208	00:14:12	00:14:14	Bottles range from $50 to $5,000.
209	00:14:15	00:14:18	What's a $5,000 bottle of champagne taste like?
210	00:14:18	00:14:20	We only sell one brand of champagne.
211	00:14:20	00:14:24	It's the host attached to the bottle that determines price.
212	00:14:24	00:14:26	Everything is legal in Clark County.
213	00:14:26	00:14:29	Miss, we don't sell sex here.
214	00:14:29	00:14:30	What do you sell?
215	00:14:30	00:14:31	A relationship.
216	00:14:32	00:14:33	Isn't that what most women want?
217	00:14:33	00:14:35	I don't know.
218	00:14:35	00:14:36	But I know what I want.
219	00:14:36	00:14:38	I want Jesse.
220	00:14:38	00:14:41	Who doesn't?
221	00:14:41	00:14:43	Let me see if he's avail.
222	00:14:59	00:15:03	Never seen the old guy before, but the lady, a bunch.
223	00:15:03	00:15:06	Last night, she got blasted on by one of the strippers downstairs.
224	00:15:06	00:15:08	Really?
225	00:15:11	00:15:12	Are they doing what I think they're doing?
226	00:15:13	00:15:14	Hosts get paid by the bottle.
227	00:15:14	00:15:16	So they drink more than their stomachs can handle.
228	00:15:16	00:15:17	Always see blood in those toilets.
229	00:15:18	00:15:21	Ah, just off work, huh?
230	00:15:21	00:15:22	Just on, actually.
231	00:15:22	00:15:24	Sara Sidle, Crime Lab.
232	00:15:25	00:15:26	Oh.
233	00:15:26	00:15:27	What can I do for you?
234	00:15:27	00:15:30	Do you know this woman?
235	00:15:31	00:15:33	Ah. Lady Dorton.
236	00:15:33	00:15:35	Yeah, she's one of my relationships.
237	00:15:35	00:15:37	Could I ask you a few questions about her?
238	00:15:37	00:15:38	Okay.
239	00:15:38	00:15:42	Um, I don't like to talk about my relationships out here.
240	00:15:42	00:15:44	Let's take it someplace a little more intimate, yeah?
241	00:15:44	00:15:46	Okay.
242	00:15:50	00:15:54	The coffin had only been in the ground for about a week.
243	00:15:54	00:15:59	Dirt and sod were pretty loose, so it was relatively easy to take out and put back in.
244	00:15:59	00:16:01	You guys sure do a lot of exhumations here.
245	00:16:01	00:16:02	As many as we have to.
246	00:16:07	00:16:08	Nobody home.
247	00:16:08	00:16:09	No surprise.
248	00:16:16	00:16:19	Look at this.
249	00:16:19	00:16:25	Lapinsky may have been burned in this shirt, but I doubt he was buried in it.
250	00:16:25	00:16:27	Dead men don't wear plaid.
251	00:16:27	00:16:28	Wait a minute.
252	00:16:28	00:16:30	Is this blood?
253	00:16:35	00:16:36	(fabric ripping) Ow!
254	00:16:36	00:16:38	Dead men don't bleed.
255	00:16:40	00:16:42	How did you meet Margo?
256	00:16:42	00:16:45	Uh, she picked me from the Meet Book.
257	00:16:45	00:16:47	And then what?
258	00:16:47	00:16:50	Uh, she wanted what most women want.
259	00:16:50	00:16:51	What's that?
260	00:16:51	00:16:52	No, thank you.
261	00:16:54	00:16:57	The dream.
262	00:16:57	00:16:58	And that's you.
263	00:16:58	00:17:02	50 G's I make a month says I am.
264	00:17:02	00:17:04	Who doesn't want to be swept off their feet?
265	00:17:04	00:17:07	I am not sure it's something that I would pay for.
266	00:17:07	00:17:10	Yeah, but you don't want to spend your whole life waiting for it either.
267	00:17:10	00:17:22	Right here, right now, a woman can have a relationship with a man who only wants to please her-- who can make her laugh, wipe away her tears, give her the confidence to be herself.
268	00:17:22	00:17:26	And how many of these relationships do you have?
269	00:17:26	00:17:29	I can handle about 25 at a time.
270	00:17:30	00:17:32	Is a woman named Cotton Candy one of them?
271	00:17:32	00:17:34	Yeah.
272	00:17:35	00:17:37	She's been financially worshipping me for a while.
273	00:17:37	00:17:40	Now, she says that she is your fiancée.
274	00:17:40	00:17:42	That's good.
275	00:17:42	00:17:44	Means I'm doing my job.
276	00:17:44	00:17:48	She told me that she and Margo had a scuffle.
277	00:17:48	00:17:50	Yeah.
278	00:17:50	00:17:59	Um... my relationships do get jealous sometimes, especially when one has more money than the other and can monopolize my time.
279	00:17:59	00:18:01	Is that why you're here, because of that little catfight?
280	00:18:01	00:18:02	No.
281	00:18:02	00:18:06	Um, Margo Dorton was...
282	00:18:06	00:18:10	bludgeoned to death with a bottle of champagne.
283	00:18:15	00:18:17	Margo was... killed?
284	00:18:17	00:18:18	Yeah.
285	00:18:18	00:18:21	And you think Cotton Candy killed Margo?
286	00:18:21	00:18:23	What do you think?
287	00:18:23	00:18:26	Um... I wouldn't know.
288	00:18:26	00:18:29	Would you know if Margo took you home the other night?
289	00:18:29	00:18:32	I don't see my relationships outside of here.
290	00:18:32	00:18:36	If it does happen, it marks the end of the relationship.
291	00:18:36	00:18:39	I mean, by having sex with me, a woman's reached her goal.
292	00:18:39	00:18:40	There's nothing more I can give her.
293	00:18:40	00:18:42	Did Margo's husband know about you?
294	00:18:42	00:18:44	She told me she was divorced.
295	00:18:44	00:18:48	Well, Jesse...
296	00:18:48	00:18:50	I'm, uh, sorry for your loss.
297	00:18:52	00:18:59	I ran the blood from the coffin through CODIS, and I got a hit, but it's not Ross Neddy.
298	00:18:59	00:19:00	So he's got a partner.
299	00:19:00	00:19:07	Well, DNA matches a Heidi Sultz, who did time for domestic assault and is currently out on parole.
300	00:19:07	00:19:08	That's funny.
301	00:19:08	00:19:11	Ross Neddy did time for domestic assault, too.
302	00:19:11	00:19:14	Maybe they're sparring partners.
303	00:19:16	00:19:18	This is Heidi's last known.
304	00:19:18	00:19:21	According to her P.O., she's been trying to straighten out.
305	00:19:21	00:19:24	She's detoxed, got a job.
306	00:19:24	00:19:26	She's dumped Ross Neddy.
307	00:19:26	00:19:29	She may be taking the right steps, but she definitely hasn't cleaned up.
308	00:19:30	00:19:31	Las Vegas P.D.
309	00:19:31	00:19:33	Heidi Sultz?
310	00:19:33	00:19:34	What's going on?
311	00:19:34	00:19:35	You're under arrest. Why?
312	00:19:35	00:19:36	Where's Ross?
313	00:19:36	00:19:38	I haven't seen that dog in weeks.
314	00:19:38	00:19:40	Anyone else living here with you?
315	00:19:40	00:19:42	Yeah, my baby and my new boyfriend Charlie.
316	00:19:42	00:19:43	Where are they?
317	00:19:43	00:19:45	Out back, hanging out.
318	00:19:45	00:19:48	Put her in the car.
319	00:19:59	00:20:00	Ross.
320	00:20:00	00:20:03	Wake up, sugar.
321	00:20:03	00:20:04	Hey, baby.
322	00:20:04	00:20:06	My name's Charlie, Charlie Keefer.
323	00:20:06	00:20:08	Get on the wall.
324	00:20:08	00:20:09	I got I.D.
325	00:20:09	00:20:11	It's in my jeans.
326	00:20:15	00:20:18	Where'd you get this, the dollar store?
327	00:20:18	00:20:19	Have a seat, Ross.
328	00:20:22	00:20:24	This is your third strike, pal.
329	00:20:24	00:20:26	Right now you're looking at a minimum of 25 years.
330	00:20:26	00:20:29	You want to talk to us?
331	00:20:29	00:20:30	We can make sure it doesn't get any worse.
332	00:20:30	00:20:31	What do you say?
333	00:20:33	00:20:34	Daddy will be right there, sweetheart.
334	00:20:34	00:20:36	It's ten more for falsifying an ID.
335	00:20:36	00:20:38	Fifteen for grave robbing.
336	00:20:38	00:20:41	Arson, that's another ten.
337	00:20:41	00:20:44	Desecrating a corpse, ten; another 20 for trafficking body parts.
338	00:20:44	00:20:46	Body parts? No way.
339	00:20:46	00:20:49	I thought those cuts were from, like, an autopsy.
340	00:20:50	00:20:53	So you admit to digging up Roger Lapinsky?
341	00:20:53	00:21:00	I've been out two months and the best job I can get is five bucks an hour welding engine parts together.
342	00:21:00	00:21:02	They wouldn't even let me flip burgers.
343	00:21:02	00:21:04	Heidi just had the baby.
344	00:21:05	00:21:06	It wasn't like it was gonna hurt anyone.
345	00:21:07	00:21:11	We dug up someone my age, took him to work.
346	00:21:11	00:21:13	made him look like me.
347	00:21:15	00:21:17	And then we torched it.
348	00:21:22	00:21:25	All I was looking for was a fresh start.
349	00:21:25	00:21:27	Best way to make it happen was to kill myself.
350	00:21:27	00:21:29	Should've stuck with the five bucks an hour.
351	00:21:31	00:21:33	Whoever did this must have been pretty angry.
352	00:21:33	00:21:36	Let me guess, multiple BFT?
353	00:21:36	00:21:37	You got it.
354	00:21:37	00:21:40	Fractured skull, broken nose, cheek bones.
355	00:21:40	00:21:40	Take a look.
356	00:21:41	00:21:44	Defensive wounds consistent with a cylindrical object.
357	00:21:44	00:21:47	Warrick found a bloody champagne bottle at the scene.
358	00:21:47	00:21:48	That'll do the trick.
359	00:21:48	00:21:50	But the death blow came in the neck area.
360	00:21:50	00:21:59	Impacted her Adam's apple with so much force, it sent a reflex arch to the vagus nerve, causing a stimulus to the heart.
361	00:21:59	00:22:04	Bradycardia set in, causing the heart to slow, and eventually to stop.
362	00:22:04	00:22:07	So where'd you go after the fight with Margo?
363	00:22:07	00:22:08	Back to the pole.
364	00:22:08	00:22:10	You're a real workaholic, huh?
365	00:22:10	00:22:14	Look, man, the more I work, the more I can be with Jesse.
366	00:22:15	00:22:18	I know how hard it is to wiggle your ass all night.
367	00:22:18	00:22:26	Now, why would you want to spend all your hard-earned money on a guy whose job it is to be with you and 24 other women?
368	00:22:26	00:22:28	He doesn't care about them.
369	00:22:28	00:22:29	Now you know this is not a real relationship.
370	00:22:30	00:22:32	It's a business transaction.
371	00:22:32	00:22:36	He's doing the same kind of thing that you are doing on the pole for the guys.
372	00:22:36	00:22:40	Those guys, they can't see past this, okay?
373	00:22:40	00:22:44	I am more than a piece of meat to Jesse.
374	00:22:44	00:22:46	He-he-he doesn't judge me.
375	00:22:46	00:22:49	All right? He doesn't blow me off.
376	00:22:49	00:22:53	He makes me smile, you know?
377	00:22:53	00:22:55	He heals me, he heals me when I'm down.
378	00:22:55	00:22:59	He makes me feel like I am Mrs. Steve Wynn.
379	00:23:00	00:23:02	Hmm.
380	00:23:02	00:23:04	Now we're going to get married, real soon.
381	00:23:04	00:23:09	Can you show me some verifiable proof of where you were the night Margo was murdered?
382	00:23:09	00:23:13	I was in V.I.P. with this pit boss, Joe Brodsky-- works at the Olympia.
383	00:23:13	00:23:17	But he's married and he'll probably deny it.
384	00:23:17	00:23:19	But I can prove it to you if you give me my wallet right now.
385	00:23:19	00:23:20	Sure. Okay, go ahead.
386	00:23:25	00:23:27	There it is.
387	00:23:34	00:23:37	Right there. He paid me with those.
388	00:23:38	00:23:40	Brand-new, straight from the bank.
389	00:23:40	00:23:42	And what would you like us to do with those?
390	00:23:42	00:23:45	You're a CSI.
391	00:23:45	00:23:50	You can take a print off of there, easy... duh.
392	00:24:05	00:24:08	Hi.
393	00:24:08	00:24:09	What are you doing?
394	00:24:09	00:24:11	Just looking.
395	00:24:11	00:24:13	What do you think?
396	00:24:14	00:24:15	Meticulous.
397	00:24:15	00:24:17	Obsessive.
398	00:24:17	00:24:19	Clearly knows his way around a modeling kit.
399	00:24:19	00:24:22	Grissom didn't make those.
400	00:24:22	00:24:25	No? Hmm.
401	00:24:25	00:24:27	Fits the profile.
402	00:24:27	00:24:31	Bugs in bottles, the Darwin desk set.
403	00:24:31	00:24:35	He's a bit of a collector of certain things.
404	00:24:35	00:24:37	Yeah, I knew a guy in Philly like that.
405	00:24:37	00:24:39	Kept a case of thumbs in his closet.
406	00:24:39	00:24:40	Friend of yours?
407	00:24:40	00:24:43	No, a serial killer.
408	00:24:43	00:24:46	Do you miss it?
409	00:24:46	00:24:47	What?
410	00:24:47	00:24:48	Philly.
411	00:24:48	00:24:51	No.
412	00:26:21	00:26:23	Hey, thought you had a deposition.
413	00:26:23	00:26:24	Oh, it got postponed.
414	00:26:24	00:26:28	So I did a little follow-up on tissue procurement companies in the area.
415	00:26:28	00:26:29	Turns out there's only two in the state.
416	00:26:29	00:26:31	One is out in Summerlin.
417	00:26:31	00:26:34	It's called Longevity Tissue Services.
418	00:26:34	00:26:35	Check this out.
419	00:26:35	00:26:38	That's the same logo you found on the umbrella that was in Lapinsky's leg.
420	00:26:38	00:26:42	Yeah. It's the Chinese character for long life.
421	00:26:43	00:26:45	So, what can Longevity do for the L.V. Police?
422	00:26:45	00:26:49	We need to know if your company received tissue or bone from a Roger Lapinsky.
423	00:26:49	00:26:50	What's the problem?
424	00:26:50	00:26:51	There might not be one.
425	00:26:52	00:26:53	All right.
426	00:26:53	00:26:55	Well, I'd be happy to check.
427	00:26:55	00:26:57	Will you excuse me, sweetie?
428	00:27:05	00:27:07	Yep, there he is.
429	00:27:07	00:27:13	Roger Lapinsky, 37 years old, died of cardiac arrest.
430	00:27:13	00:27:14	It's tragic.
431	00:27:14	00:27:18	We're going to need a copy of his records, and we're going to need to confiscate his parts.
432	00:27:18	00:27:21	And if you don't tell me what's going on, you're going to need a warrant.
433	00:27:21	00:27:23	This is a criminal investigation.
434	00:27:23	00:27:24	Those parts are evidence now.
435	00:27:29	00:27:34	You know, I was always under the impression that the body parts were to be removed at the hospital.
436	00:27:34	00:27:44	Major organs have to be removed at the hospital and then transplanted into the new patients within four to six hours, but bone and tissue can be removed at any point and stored for up to five years.
437	00:27:44	00:27:46	Who gives you access to those parts?
438	00:27:46	00:27:47	I always have signed consent from next of kin.
439	00:27:47	00:27:49	And?
440	00:27:49	00:27:51	Most funeral homes have tissue recovery coordinators.
441	00:27:51	00:27:54	They choose who the parts go to.
442	00:27:54	00:27:57	If you have a good reputation, you have a better chance of getting the parts.
443	00:27:58	00:27:59	I help the dead help the living.
444	00:27:59	00:28:05	According to your records, Roger Lipinsky's body parts came from the Silver Hills Mortuary.
445	00:28:05	00:28:07	If that's what it says.
446	00:28:12	00:28:13	Hey.
447	00:28:13	00:28:15	So you heard Cotton Candy's alibi checked out?
448	00:28:16	00:28:17	Yeah.
449	00:28:17	00:28:21	And Brass talked to Mr. Dorton's limo driver.
450	00:28:21	00:28:24	Confirms his story, he got home way past T.O.D.
451	00:28:24	00:28:26	I don't get it, Warrick.
452	00:28:26	00:28:32	The vic is in a good marriage, and she's spending thousands on a fake boyfriend that she's not even having sex with.
453	00:28:32	00:28:34	It doesn't make any sense.
454	00:28:34	00:28:38	Like this void on the sofa for instance.
455	00:28:38	00:28:44	It suggests the presence of a third person, but we don't have any evidence to back that up.
456	00:28:44	00:28:46	Maybe it's not a person.
457	00:28:46	00:28:49	Maybe it's a thing.
458	00:28:49	00:28:53	Rectangular, roughly, what, 11 by 14 inches?
459	00:28:53	00:28:56	It was obviously important enough that the killer took it.
460	00:28:56	00:28:58	What if he didn't take it?
461	00:30:19	00:30:22	Whose baby is this?
462	00:30:22	00:30:23	Margo's.
463	00:30:23	00:30:27	I remember, Bill, you telling me that you didn't have kids.
464	00:30:27	00:30:30	We don't... or I don't.
465	00:30:31	00:30:33	She gave him up right after we met.
466	00:30:33	00:30:36	She was 17.
467	00:30:36	00:30:37	And I didn't want any kids.
468	00:30:37	00:30:39	Who'd Margo give the baby to?
469	00:30:39	00:30:42	The biological father, but he was a drunk.
470	00:30:42	00:30:44	Last we heard, the kid ran away.
471	00:30:44	00:30:48	She was looking at these photos when she was killed. Yeah.
472	00:30:48	00:30:50	She started taking them out ever since she hit menopause.
473	00:30:50	00:30:53	Wasn't she a little young for menopause?
474	00:30:53	00:30:56	They call it premature menopause and she was having a tough time with it.
475	00:30:57	00:31:02	The mood swings, the brain fog, the emotional detachment.
476	00:31:02	00:31:04	The finality of not having any more children.
477	00:31:04	00:31:06	Bill...
478	00:31:06	00:31:14	did you know that Margo was frequenting um...a so-called host club, and paying money to a male escort?
479	00:31:14	00:31:15	No. She was paying for sex?
480	00:31:15	00:31:17	She was paying...
481	00:31:17	00:31:18	for companionship.
482	00:31:33	00:31:35	I'm looking for Salvatore Heinz.
483	00:31:35	00:31:36	You got him.
484	00:31:36	00:31:37	Mike Keppler, Las Vegas Crime Lab.
485	00:31:37	00:31:39	Sorry if I don't shake.
486	00:31:39	00:31:42	I, uh, hope you don't mind if I keep working here, I'm kind of on a deadline.
487	00:31:43	00:31:45	That's mortuary humor.
488	00:31:45	00:31:47	I'm sure it never gets old.
489	00:31:47	00:31:50	We're following up on a body that came through here.
490	00:31:50	00:31:52	Roger Lapinsky.
491	00:31:53	00:31:55	You know, he does look familiar.
492	00:31:55	00:31:59	I believe he's spending his eternal rest at Horizon Meadows Cemetery.
493	00:31:59	00:32:00	Not anymore. Someone dug him up.
494	00:32:00	00:32:02	Aw, geez.
495	00:32:02	00:32:05	You know, sometimes I wonder what the heck is going on with the world these days.
496	00:32:05	00:32:08	His major bones, veins and tendons were all stolen.
497	00:32:08	00:32:11	Recovered! Not stolen.
498	00:32:12	00:32:14	I'm a certified tissue recovery coordinator.
499	00:32:14	00:32:15	Oh, yeah?
500	00:32:15	00:32:19	That where you learned how to stuff the bodies with umbrellas?
501	00:32:19	00:32:22	That was a one-time thing.
502	00:32:22	00:32:26	I ran out of PVC pipe, and, uh...
503	00:32:26	00:32:28	so I improvised.
504	00:32:28	00:32:32	Understandable. Look, it was a closed casket service, and uh...
505	00:32:32	00:32:33	I have a signed consent form.
506	00:32:33	00:32:35	Where? If you don't mind, I'd like to take a look at that.
507	00:32:36	00:32:37	Sure.
508	00:32:37	00:32:40	Anything for LVPD.
509	00:32:49	00:32:54	I take it you do a lot a work with, uh... Longevity Tissue Services?
510	00:32:54	00:32:56	Some.
511	00:32:56	00:32:59	Those are just promotional items.
512	00:32:59	00:33:00	Handy in a pinch, huh?
513	00:33:03	00:33:06	(cabinet drawer slams shut) Lapinsky, Roger.
514	00:33:06	00:33:08	It's all yours.
515	00:33:08	00:33:10	I got copies. Thanks.
516	00:33:15	00:33:17	C.O.D., cardiac arrest.
517	00:33:17	00:33:20	Everything seems to be in order here.
518	00:33:20	00:33:21	Like I said.
519	00:33:21	00:33:23	Thanks for your time.
520	00:33:26	00:33:27	Keppler.
521	00:33:27	00:33:28	Robbins here.
522	00:33:28	00:33:30	Want a C.O.D. on your Frankenstein?
523	00:33:30	00:33:32	Beat you to it-- cardiac arrest.
524	00:33:32	00:33:33	Not according to histology.
525	00:33:33	00:33:35	Roger Lapinsky died of leukemia.
526	00:33:38	00:33:40	You want to repeat that, Doc? Sure.
527	00:33:40	00:33:43	Roger Lapinksy died of leukemia.
528	00:33:44	00:33:46	Thanks.
529	00:33:48	00:33:49	If you don't mind, I'll, uh...
530	00:33:50	00:33:52	stick around here till the warrant comes.
531	00:33:54	00:33:58	I got a copy of Roger Lapinsky's death certificate from Carson City.
532	00:33:58	00:34:03	This is the one we got from the mortician, that old nut job, see? Changed the C.O.D.
533	00:34:03	00:34:05	It turns out, Ty Miloni...
534	00:34:05	00:34:07	is a bit of a hustler as well.
535	00:34:07	00:34:14	Those umbrellas were a promotional gift for a vitamin telemarketing company he ran a few years back.
536	00:34:14	00:34:15	This guy isn't even a doctor.
537	00:34:15	00:34:17	He did drop out of chiropractic school.
538	00:34:17	00:34:21	You're telling me that any Tom, Dick, or Harry with a sign can open up a tissue bank?
539	00:34:21	00:34:22	Well, if you're FDA registered, yeah.
540	00:34:22	00:34:23	How do you get FDA registered?
541	00:34:23	00:34:24	You just fill out a form.
542	00:34:25	00:34:32	In the last three years, 37 of the bone and tissue donors were from Silver Hills mortuary that went to this Longevity clinic.
543	00:34:32	00:34:36	C.O.D in 23 of those cases was cardiac arrest.
544	00:34:36	00:34:39	And most of those decedents were in their 30s and 40s.
545	00:34:39	00:34:40	That's a lot of young heart attacks.
546	00:34:41	00:34:45	We're going to through all these C.O.D's and match them up against the official death certificates.
547	00:34:45	00:34:47	And do more exhumations.
548	00:34:49	00:34:55	The only thing I'm wondering-- is the mortician hustling the tissue bank guy or they're working together.
549	00:35:54	00:35:59	Dr. Stewart, Dr. Klein, Dr. Combs, Dr. Jones.
550	00:35:59	00:36:00	That's not my handwriting.
551	00:36:00	00:36:04	Well that's the point of forgery, isn't it, Mr. Heinz?
552	00:36:04	00:36:09	A man dies of leukemia, and his body comes into your mortuary, and you decide to...
553	00:36:09	00:36:12	sell his spare parts for a few extra bucks.
554	00:36:12	00:36:24	Only problem is, nobody wants to buy diseased body parts, so you make a new death certificate, change the C.O.D., sign off with a legit doctor's signature, and cash a check from Ty Miloni.
555	00:36:24	00:36:25	I'm so disappointed with Mr. Heinz.
556	00:36:25	00:36:27	He always seemed so honest.
557	00:36:27	00:36:32	Have you ever followed up on any of the patients who received parts from the Silver Hills Mortuary?
558	00:36:32	00:36:35	No. That's the hospital's job. But as far as I know, none of the recipients have ever complained.
559	00:36:35	00:36:37	Maybe that's 'cause they're not around anymore.
560	00:36:37	00:36:43	We followed up on several patients who received Silver Hills bone and tissue from your clinic and now seven of them are dead.
561	00:36:43	00:36:48	Three from hepatitis, three from cancer, and one AIDS-related.
562	00:36:48	00:36:51	The same thing ironically killed the donors.
563	00:36:51	00:36:55	One of those victims was a 15-year-old healthy high school soccer player.
564	00:36:55	00:36:57	You gave him a contaminated kneecap.
565	00:36:57	00:36:59	Oh, my God.
566	00:36:59	00:37:00	He came to me!
567	00:37:01	00:37:05	You harvested diseased body parts and sold them under false pretenses.
568	00:37:05	00:37:07	He told me what to do.
569	00:37:07	00:37:08	He... he said it was safe!
570	00:37:08	00:37:11	But you didn't have to do it, did you, Mr. Heinz?
571	00:37:11	00:37:15	You took money, and people died.
572	00:37:15	00:37:19	Now, whether or not we got him-- we got you.
573	00:37:19	00:37:20	You've got nothing on me.
574	00:37:20	00:37:21	I don't care what that...
575	00:37:21	00:37:23	little body snatcher tells you.
576	00:37:24	00:37:27	The families are going to sue you and your company into bankruptcy.
577	00:37:27	00:37:28	They can try.
578	00:37:28	00:37:30	That is what signed release forms are for.
579	00:37:30	00:37:33	You're reopening a very nasty, old wound for them, now.
580	00:37:33	00:37:35	Uh-uh. I didn't do anything.
581	00:37:35	00:37:36	Because of you...
582	00:37:36	00:37:40	they're going to have to rebury their mother, their father, their son, their daughter.
583	00:37:44	00:37:46	Ty...
584	00:37:46	00:37:47	let me tell you something.
585	00:37:47	00:37:50	I'm gonna come down to that clinic...
586	00:37:51	00:37:56	...and I'm going to go through it piece by piece by piece.
587	00:37:56	00:37:59	And if something doesn't jibe, I can assure you...
588	00:37:59	00:38:02	sir, I will find it.
589	00:38:02	00:38:04	Well, that is your job, isn't it?
590	00:38:04	00:38:06	Yes, it is.
591	00:38:07	00:38:08	And you'll have my full cooperation.
592	00:38:10	00:38:13	I did a little background on Jesse, the host.
593	00:38:13	00:38:16	He was in and out of 11 different foster homes.
594	00:38:16	00:38:18	Brass accessed his juvie records.
595	00:38:18	00:38:22	He had multiple arrests for prostitution, and drug possession.
596	00:38:22	00:38:25	Kid had a hard life if he had to take it to the streets to make a buck.
597	00:38:25	00:38:29	We still need his DNA, and if he did kill Margo, he's not just gonna give it up.
598	00:38:29	00:38:31	What about the vomit that we found in the toilet at the crime scene?
599	00:38:31	00:38:33	What about it?
600	00:38:33	00:38:35	Well, the hosts drink a lot and throw up a lot.
601	00:38:35	00:38:38	Busboy says he always finds blood in the toilets.
602	00:38:38	00:38:41	If Jesse's a host, chances are he's throwing up blood, too.
603	00:38:42	00:38:49	Jesse, we found your DNA in Margo Dorton's toilet.
604	00:38:50	00:38:53	I thought that you said that you didn't see your relationships outside of the club.
605	00:38:53	00:38:56	Unless, of course, the relationship is ending.
606	00:38:56	00:39:00	Oh yeah, that's a cold word for it-- for murder.
607	00:39:00	00:39:03	I didn't kill her, all right?
608	00:39:03	00:39:06	I ended the relationship and I bounced.
609	00:39:06	00:39:08	Champagne got me sick.
610	00:39:08	00:39:10	No, I don't think it was the champagne, Jesse.
611	00:39:10	00:39:13	I think it was Margo.
612	00:39:13	00:39:20	She was coming to see you for a couple of months, spending a lot of money, you were running your pro-game, you know, doing the host thing.
613	00:39:20	00:39:23	Holding her hand, touching, consoling her.
614	00:39:24	00:39:27	Laying on the old Jesse magic.
615	00:39:27	00:39:30	But then she laid some pretty heavy information on you.
616	00:39:30	00:39:32	I want you to come home with me.
617	00:39:35	00:39:37	So you want to end the relationship?
618	00:39:37	00:39:39	I guess you thought, you know...
619	00:39:39	00:39:42	here's Margo, this cougar...
620	00:39:42	00:39:46	wants to take me back to the love pit, end the relationship.
621	00:39:46	00:39:49	Sexy time.
622	00:39:49	00:39:52	But it didn't turn out that way, did it?
623	00:39:55	00:39:57	Jesse, I...
624	00:39:57	00:39:58	Shh...
625	00:39:59	00:40:00	Look, um...
626	00:40:00	00:40:02	I have something I need to show you.
627	00:40:02	00:40:04	Okay?
628	00:40:08	00:40:10	This is you.
629	00:40:13	00:40:16	I'm your mother, Jesse.
630	00:40:21	00:40:23	I've waited my entire life to tell you this.
631	00:40:23	00:40:24	I love you.
632	00:40:24	00:40:26	I'm sorry.
633	00:40:27	00:40:28	No!
634	00:40:45	00:40:47	You look a little pale, Jesse.
635	00:40:47	00:40:50	Are you getting this?
636	00:40:50	00:40:52	She lied to me.
637	00:40:52	00:40:56	Said she hired some private investigator to find me.
638	00:40:57	00:41:03	Said she'd been building up the nerve to tell me the truth.
639	00:41:03	00:41:06	Said she had a lot to make up for.
640	00:41:06	00:41:10	And that, uh...
641	00:41:10	00:41:12	I could have her car.
642	00:41:12	00:41:16	And that I didn't have to work anymore.
643	00:41:16	00:41:18	You thought those were lies?
644	00:41:18	00:41:21	Yeah, lies to get closer to me.
645	00:41:21	00:41:24	All my clients have their tactics.
646	00:41:24	00:41:29	But hers was... insane.
647	00:41:29	00:41:33	She wasn't lying to you, Jesse.
648	00:41:33	00:41:39	You have 13 alleles in common.
649	00:41:41	00:41:42	You killed your mother.
650	00:41:44	00:41:47	Then take me to jail.
651	00:41:47	00:41:50	You know, call me a killer...
652	00:41:50	00:42:01	a murderer, whatever, but don't tell me I have a mother... because I don't.
653	00:42:01	00:42:02	I never did.
654	00:42:04	00:42:06	And I never will.
655	00:42:42	00:42:43	Hey.
656	00:42:43	00:42:45	Need some help?
657	00:42:45	00:42:46	Aren't you off shift?
658	00:42:46	00:42:48	Yeah. Are you?
659	00:42:48	00:42:50	Yeah.
660	00:42:50	00:42:51	Thanks.
661	00:42:51	00:42:53	I'll be back in a minute.
662	00:43:16	00:43:17	Keppler?
