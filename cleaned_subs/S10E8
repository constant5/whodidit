0	00:00:08	00:00:09	Whoo! Yeah!
1	00:00:09	00:00:10	Unbelieveable!
2	00:00:10	00:00:12	All X's, baby.
3	00:00:12	00:00:15	All X's all the time.
4	00:00:15	00:00:19	I'll tell you what, he is a cocky young man, that Kevin X-Man Chatts.
5	00:00:19	00:00:21	Look at him out there playing to the camera.
6	00:00:21	00:00:22	What an ego, huh?
7	00:00:22	00:00:23	Yeah. I'll tell you though...
8	00:00:23	00:00:26	Look at this. Oh, man.
9	00:00:26	00:00:27	The crowd's loving it.
10	00:00:27	00:00:28	The fans love him.
11	00:00:28	00:00:30	Chevy Cigs has always had his number though.
12	00:00:30	00:00:34	They've met 12 times on tour-- Chevy has 12 trophies.
13	00:00:34	00:00:37	X has zero.
14	00:00:37	00:00:40	Well, Chevy needs to clear the rack here, he'll make it 13. All right.
15	00:00:40	00:00:41	Here's the determination.
16	00:00:41	00:00:44	This is the closest they've ever been. Here it goes.
17	00:00:48	00:00:49	Oh.
18	00:00:49	00:00:50	Oh, my goodness! Hah! Yeah!
19	00:00:50	00:00:53	That's right, the X's are all mine!
20	00:00:53	00:00:55	Seven-ten split. The dreaded field goal.
21	00:00:55	00:00:57	How many times has this been done, J.T., in history?
22	00:00:57	00:00:58	Three times.
23	00:00:58	00:00:59	Only three times.
24	00:00:59	00:01:00	Three times, national TV.
25	00:01:00	00:01:04	Chevy Cigs has got to pick them both up to make this a win for him.
26	00:01:04	00:01:08	If not, X-Man wins and becomes the new champion.
27	00:01:14	00:01:16	Oh, my God!
28	00:01:26	00:01:28	This head used to be attached to the body Ronald Tobin.
29	00:01:29	00:01:30	He works here at the rental desk.
30	00:01:30	00:01:32	That's his girlfriend over there.
31	00:01:32	00:01:33	She works here, too.
32	00:01:33	00:01:34	Cocktail waitress.
33	00:01:35	00:01:36	Understandably in shock.
34	00:01:36	00:01:38	What do you mean you don't know when the match is gonna resume?
35	00:01:38	00:01:40	I'm going back to Omaha tomorrow.
36	00:01:40	00:01:42	I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.
37	00:01:42	00:01:43	You got to be kidding me.
38	00:01:43	00:01:45	Hey, can you speed this up?
39	00:01:45	00:01:46	I was beating this guy straight up!
40	00:01:46	00:01:48	You haven't won anything yet, kid.
41	00:01:48	00:01:50	We're not even letting him wash his hands.
42	00:01:50	00:01:51	Do you think we're going to let you bowl?
43	00:01:51	00:01:53	Look, I wasn't talking to you.
44	00:01:53	00:01:54	Hey, hey, hey. Come with me.
45	00:01:54	00:01:55	Let's go. Come on.
46	00:01:55	00:01:57	This isn't over yet. See you soon.
47	00:01:57	00:01:58	All right, that's it, I'm done.
48	00:01:58	00:02:02	Just make sure to give your contact info before you leave.
49	00:02:04	00:02:06	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
50	00:02:06	00:02:07	You cannot touch that ball; it's evidence.
51	00:02:07	00:02:09	I've thrown with that ball for ten years.
52	00:02:09	00:02:10	It's my go-to ball.
53	00:02:10	00:02:11	You'll get it back.
54	00:02:11	00:02:12	Eventually.
55	00:02:12	00:02:13	Please follow me, sir.
56	00:02:13	00:02:15	Right this way.
57	00:02:16	00:02:18	When did bowling become so serious?
58	00:02:18	00:02:27	You know, it doesn't take an expert to know, if the head came out the return, it went in behind the lane.
59	00:02:27	00:02:29	Maybe that's where the rest of the vic is.
60	00:03:31	00:03:32	Yeah?
61	00:03:32	00:03:34	Yeah, I didn't find a body back here.
62	00:03:34	00:03:38	But I did find an empty bowling ball bag with blood in it.
63	00:03:38	00:03:41	Bag without a ball, head without a body.
64	00:03:41	00:03:42	At least we know what we're looking for.
65	00:04:24	00:04:27	Man, this is more complicated than I thought.
66	00:04:29	00:04:32	You know, at the turn of the century, this was all done by hand.
67	00:04:32	00:04:33	Really? Yeah.
68	00:04:34	00:04:40	Ten-year-old kids called pin boys would run around clearing and resetting all the pins, returning the balls to the bowlers.
69	00:04:40	00:04:41	Too bad they're not around anymore.
70	00:04:41	00:04:44	We might have some suspects.
71	00:04:44	00:04:45	Looks like the head rolled through there, huh?
72	00:04:45	00:04:50	Yeah, this is the tower section of the ball return conveyor system.
73	00:04:50	00:04:53	The killer had to start there.
74	00:04:53	00:04:54	It's the only way in.
75	00:04:54	00:04:55	The head went into the pit...
76	00:04:58	00:04:59	...through the ball door.
77	00:04:59	00:05:04	Up the tower, under the lanes, through the accelerator...
78	00:05:07	00:05:08	...and out the return.
79	00:05:08	00:05:11	You sure do know a lot about bowling.
80	00:05:11	00:05:14	Uh, mechanical engineering class in college.
81	00:05:15	00:05:17	We took a field trip to a bowling alley.
82	00:05:17	00:05:19	Every Saturday night, family league.
83	00:05:19	00:05:20	Yeah?
84	00:05:20	00:05:21	You any good?
85	00:05:21	00:05:22	I'm not bad.
86	00:05:22	00:05:23	Okay.
87	00:05:23	00:05:25	Photo, mark and sample.
88	00:05:25	00:05:27	I have the victim's vehicle registration.
89	00:05:27	00:05:30	I'm gonna go see if his car's in the parking lot.
90	00:05:30	00:05:35	Too bad the only surveillance is at the register and front entrance, huh?
91	00:05:50	00:05:54	I knew that field trip would come in handy.
92	00:06:34	00:06:35	LVPD. Out of the car.
93	00:06:37	00:06:40	Come on.
94	00:06:40	00:06:41	Hands, hands.
95	00:06:41	00:06:42	Let me see some hands.
96	00:06:42	00:06:44	Put them on the car.
97	00:06:44	00:06:45	Don't move.
98	00:06:46	00:06:47	What are you doing in there?
99	00:06:49	00:06:51	I was sleeping, man.
100	00:06:51	00:06:53	Do you know who this car belongs to?
101	00:06:53	00:06:57	Yeah, Ron Ron. He's been letting me crash here till I got my own digs.
102	00:06:59	00:07:00	I know he's dead.
103	00:07:00	00:07:03	I'd seen his head come rolling out of that thing and all that.
104	00:07:03	00:07:05	I'm still pretty wigged out about it.
105	00:07:05	00:07:07	But you're still sleeping in his car?
106	00:07:07	00:07:10	It's a lot more comfortable than the concrete bedsprings I'm used to.
107	00:07:10	00:07:11	I'm homeless.
108	00:07:11	00:07:12	How do you know him?
109	00:07:12	00:07:13	We're from the same hood.
110	00:07:14	00:07:18	I've been down in the dumps, and Ron Ron was helping me out, money-wise.
111	00:07:18	00:07:20	Even got me a stock boy gig over at the SSB.
112	00:07:20	00:07:22	Yeah, what's the SSB?
113	00:07:22	00:07:24	It's the Silver State Bowling Supply.
114	00:07:24	00:07:25	Duh.
115	00:07:25	00:07:27	What about all this bowling gear?
116	00:07:27	00:07:29	Wouldn't happen to be stolen, would it?
117	00:07:29	00:07:31	Man, I don't know donkey about bowling.
118	00:07:31	00:07:32	That's Ron Ron's thing.
119	00:07:32	00:07:34	You just told me you work at the bowling supply company.
120	00:07:35	00:07:36	I just started there.
121	00:07:36	00:07:37	And like I said, that's Ron Ron's thing.
122	00:07:38	00:07:39	Yeah, so is this car. You're moving out today, buddy.
123	00:07:40	00:07:41	Get out of there. Come on.
124	00:07:41	00:07:44	Man, what are y'all doing up so early?
125	00:07:44	00:07:46	Get out of there.
126	00:08:13	00:08:16	Carla always swore she was innocent.
127	00:08:16	00:08:18	And you believed her?
128	00:08:18	00:08:21	As a Public Defender, I believe she was innocent until proven guilty.
129	00:08:21	00:08:25	Well, based on what's here, that shouldn't be a problem.
130	00:08:25	00:08:34	But looking at it, 13 months ago, Carla York and her husband James got into a heated argument, which got a little more heated.
131	00:08:34	00:08:38	Carla and James had a pretty volatile relationship.
132	00:08:38	00:08:43	He liked to play around, there were allegations of affairs, they fought all the time.
133	00:08:43	00:08:44	And Carla had served on the National Guard.
134	00:08:47	00:08:50	So, she was trained to shoot.
135	00:08:52	00:08:54	The revolver was found in the bushes-- a .38.
136	00:08:54	00:08:56	It was registered to the husband.
137	00:08:56	00:08:59	It was usually kept in the master bedroom nightstand.
138	00:08:59	00:09:01	This was confirmed by Ferrotrace.
139	00:09:01	00:09:03	Bullets matched the gun.
140	00:09:03	00:09:04	Now, what was your defense?
141	00:09:04	00:09:06	The usual.
142	00:09:06	00:09:07	Ah. Attack the evidence.
143	00:09:08	00:09:10	There was no GSR on the wife.
144	00:09:10	00:09:13	Day shift found the shower still wet, so she obviously cleaned up.
145	00:09:13	00:09:15	She was heavily intoxicated-- BAC 0.18.
146	00:09:15	00:09:17	She claims she didn't remember anything that night.
147	00:09:17	00:09:19	How many innocent clients have you heard that from?
148	00:09:19	00:09:21	She had no history of violence.
149	00:09:21	00:09:24	Well, a lot of domestic murderers don't.
150	00:09:24	00:09:28	According to the police report, the sister named Hannah was staying with them.
151	00:09:29	00:09:34	Then she heard the shot, found the body, called 911.
152	00:09:34	00:09:36	Was the sister ever a suspect?
153	00:09:36	00:09:37	Unfortunately, no.
154	00:09:37	00:09:41	She'd been on a date earlier that evening, with a movie ticket stub to prove it.
155	00:09:41	00:09:43	Taxi dropped her off at the house.
156	00:09:43	00:09:45	Cabbie confirmed angry voices inside.
157	00:09:45	00:09:49	Sister claims she was out back trying to get away from the noise.
158	00:09:53	00:09:55	Are you certain there was no one else in the house?
159	00:09:55	00:09:59	Just the vic's 11-month-old daughter in the master bedroom crib.
160	00:10:00	00:10:02	I tried to get Carla to plead out.
161	00:10:02	00:10:05	She just wouldn't do it.
162	00:10:05	00:10:08	Jury came back guilty in five hours.
163	00:10:08	00:10:10	She was dead five hours after that.
164	00:10:10	00:10:12	Why are you so interested in the original case?
165	00:10:12	00:10:15	This woman hung herself over the verdict.
166	00:10:15	00:10:17	I would like to know why.
167	00:10:17	00:10:18	You're thorough.
168	00:10:19	00:10:21	I heard that about you.
169	00:10:21	00:10:22	Is there anything else you need from me?
170	00:10:22	00:10:25	No. No, thanks.
171	00:10:25	00:10:26	Take care.
172	00:10:28	00:10:34	You know, I brought Carla's kid to the jail a few times to visit her while she was awaiting trial.
173	00:10:34	00:10:39	She always used to tell her, her dad was on vacation and that he loved her very much.
174	00:10:40	00:10:42	It's kind of sad, huh?
175	00:11:00	00:11:02	Ah, just in time for the headtopsy.
176	00:11:03	00:11:05	I heard someone was using this one as a bowling ball.
177	00:11:05	00:11:07	Well, his head is very spherical.
178	00:11:07	00:11:10	My father had bowling alleys in every one of his casinos.
179	00:11:10	00:11:14	I liked everything about them but the bowling.
180	00:11:14	00:11:17	Rented shoes that you have to disinfect before you put them on.
181	00:11:17	00:11:19	Not for me.
182	00:11:19	00:11:22	This looks like manual saw strokes.
183	00:11:23	00:11:26	Probably a handsaw or a box saw.
184	00:11:26	00:11:29	Multiple cuts from multiple angles, hesitation marks.
185	00:11:29	00:11:32	Whoever did this wasn't skilled.
186	00:11:32	00:11:37	Lack of hemorrhagic tissue suggests decapitation was postmortem.
187	00:11:37	00:11:39	What do you think this is?
188	00:11:40	00:11:42	Has an alveolar texture.
189	00:11:42	00:11:44	Lung tissue? Mm-hmm.
190	00:11:44	00:11:46	How'd it end up in his nose?
191	00:11:46	00:11:50	Maybe the vic suffered some kind of traumatic injury to the chest, like a gunshot.
192	00:11:55	00:11:58	Could be C.O.D.
193	00:11:58	00:12:03	We found this guy in Ronny's car, and he has a pretty long rap sheet.
194	00:12:03	00:12:06	Oh, yeah, that's Vitas.
195	00:12:06	00:12:11	He was going through some really hard times, and Ronny was helping him out.
196	00:12:11	00:12:13	Do you think he killed Ronny?
197	00:12:13	00:12:14	We don't know.
198	00:12:14	00:12:17	When was the last time that you saw Ronny alive?
199	00:12:17	00:12:23	Earlier today; he was working.
200	00:12:23	00:12:25	You know, before...
201	00:12:25	00:12:27	his-his head...
202	00:12:27	00:12:29	You know.
203	00:12:29	00:12:33	Did he have any enemies that you know of?
204	00:12:33	00:12:34	Just himself.
205	00:12:34	00:12:42	He wanted to be pro, but he ended up being the shoe boy, and it really started getting to him.
206	00:12:42	00:12:44	So he gave up on his dream.
207	00:12:44	00:12:46	No, his dream gave up on him.
208	00:12:46	00:12:48	He definitely had the physical ability.
209	00:12:48	00:12:52	I don't know anyone that could throw a harder ball.
210	00:12:52	00:12:55	He even beat the X-Man the other day in a pickup game.
211	00:12:55	00:13:00	I-I know this is weird to say after what just happened...
212	00:13:02	00:13:04	...but he just didn't really have it all up here.
213	00:13:05	00:13:09	You know, it takes more than skill to bag ten in a row five days in a row.
214	00:13:09	00:13:11	You really have to have a level head.
215	00:14:02	00:14:05	Yep, it's my two-ball roller.
216	00:14:05	00:14:06	What makes you so sure?
217	00:14:07	00:14:09	It was made for me. The company sponsors me.
218	00:14:09	00:14:10	You know, those are my colors.
219	00:14:10	00:14:12	Where'd you find it?
220	00:14:12	00:14:14	Back of the bowling alley with the victim's blood on it.
221	00:14:15	00:14:16	Why don't you have a seat?
222	00:14:17	00:14:23	You know you should be talking to the guy who snaked it from my dressing room first day of the competition.
223	00:14:23	00:14:25	I've been using my spare.
224	00:14:25	00:14:26	Sit down.
225	00:14:28	00:14:29	Sit down.
226	00:14:33	00:14:34	So, do you know the victim?
227	00:14:34	00:14:36	Not really.
228	00:14:36	00:14:39	Well, according to twitterverse, you know him pretty well.
229	00:14:39	00:14:40	I don't have a Twitter.
230	00:14:40	00:14:42	You fans do, critics do.
231	00:14:42	00:14:43	I do. I tweet.
232	00:14:43	00:14:46	Listen to this.
233	00:14:46	00:14:51	Kevin X gets beat by local Vegas putz.
234	00:14:51	00:14:52	Do you know what a putz is?
235	00:14:54	00:14:56	Shoe boy makes X-Man look like an amateur.
236	00:14:56	00:15:01	X-Man should put down the bottle before he loses to his self. (chuckles)
237	00:15:01	00:15:03	Ooh, that's-that's harsh.
238	00:15:03	00:15:07	This is like a whole wealth of information.
239	00:15:07	00:15:09	This is a detective's dream.
240	00:15:11	00:15:15	Okay. Yeah... we played.
241	00:15:17	00:15:20	Hey, guy, hook me up with a lane.
242	00:15:20	00:15:21	Sorry, we're all full up right now.
243	00:15:21	00:15:23	You're full?! Yeah.
244	00:15:23	00:15:24	Do you know who I am?
245	00:15:24	00:15:26	I don't care who you are.
246	00:15:26	00:15:29	Okay, look, let's just say that I'm the best bowler in the place, all right?
247	00:15:29	00:15:31	I doubt that.
248	00:15:31	00:15:33	He challenged me, I couldn't disappoint the ladies.
249	00:15:33	00:15:34	Right.
250	00:15:34	00:15:36	And you were drunk and you think highly of yourself.
251	00:15:36	00:15:38	Yeah.
252	00:15:47	00:15:49	Come on...
253	00:15:57	00:16:00	I'll admit he wasn't bad.
254	00:16:00	00:16:01	That must have pissed you off.
255	00:16:01	00:16:04	It didn't piss me off enough to kill him, if that's where you're going.
256	00:16:04	00:16:07	It's physically impossible for me to have tossed that head in the ball return, okay?
257	00:16:07	00:16:08	I can't be in two places at once.
258	00:16:08	00:16:11	I'm a bowler, okay? I'm not Criss Angel.
259	00:16:11	00:16:13	Maybe you had a partner.
260	00:16:13	00:16:16	All right, let's go to motive.
261	00:16:16	00:16:19	Tell me about you and Chevy Cigs.
262	00:16:19	00:16:22	He's, uh, he's old school. I'm new.
263	00:16:22	00:16:25	He uses a three-finger grip, I use a no-finger grip.
264	00:16:25	00:16:27	He's a hook guy, I'm a straight roller.
265	00:16:27	00:16:31	I'm a freewheeler, he's a... technician.
266	00:16:31	00:16:33	But he's the only guy you never beat on the tour.
267	00:16:33	00:16:39	You know, I did some research 'cause bowling's not my thing, but I found out that the old school is always kicking new school's ass.
268	00:16:39	00:16:43	So maybe you thought the only way to beat Chevy is to mess with his head...
269	00:16:44	00:16:46	...with a head.
270	00:16:48	00:16:52	You gonna let me go now or should I ask for my lawyer?
271	00:16:52	00:16:53	No, you can go. (PDA beeps)
272	00:16:54	00:16:56	Just don't leave town.
273	00:17:52	00:17:54	Fire in one!
274	00:18:13	00:18:17	You got the same entry wound path from two different shooting angles.
275	00:18:17	00:18:19	Uh-huh.
276	00:18:19	00:18:22	How? (chuckles)
277	00:18:22	00:18:26	A bullet hitting a slanted surface should deflect up, right?
278	00:18:26	00:18:29	Not always.
279	00:18:29	00:18:31	Not when they're hollow points.
280	00:18:31	00:18:40	One theory is because the lower lip of the hollow point strikes the glass first, the unbalanced force on the bullet deflects it down, sometimes as much as ten to 15 degrees.
281	00:18:40	00:18:46	If you didn't account for it, you might conclude that a shot came from a second-story window when really, it was fired from level ground.
282	00:18:46	00:18:48	Was this a day shift case?
283	00:18:48	00:18:53	Those lazy, incompetent bastards... Look, it means that the victim's wife didn't shoot him.
284	00:18:53	00:18:55	You just exonerated her.
285	00:18:55	00:18:59	Like my daddy used to say, A day late and a dollar short.
286	00:19:01	00:19:03	Where'd you get these images?
287	00:19:03	00:19:05	The bowling alley has pinsetter cameras.
288	00:19:05	00:19:07	Really? Yeah.
289	00:19:07	00:19:15	Near the end of the lane, the ball breaks the infrared sensor, which initiates the pinsetter control unit.
290	00:19:15	00:19:23	After the ball hits, a CCD camera snaps an image, activating the sensors in the pinsetter, telling it which pins have been knocked down and which need to be picked up.
291	00:19:23	00:19:27	The sensors then relay that information to the automatic scoring system.
292	00:19:28	00:19:32	That is Chevy's last toss.
293	00:19:32	00:19:34	The dreaded seven-ten split.
294	00:19:34	00:19:37	But check this out.
295	00:19:37	00:19:42	The victim's head in the killer's hands, moments before the head rolled out.
296	00:19:42	00:19:47	Now, according to Brass, our vic played Kevin X the night before.
297	00:19:47	00:19:52	So, I went through those photos and I found this.
298	00:19:55	00:19:56	Hey, I know that guy.
299	00:19:56	00:19:59	Know where he works, too.
300	00:20:07	00:20:09	We're looking for Vitas Ling.
301	00:20:09	00:20:10	Back there.
302	00:20:14	00:20:16	You recognize that smell?
303	00:20:18	00:20:22	Hey, Cheech.
304	00:20:22	00:20:24	Got your hands on a little chronic, eh, hombre?
305	00:20:26	00:20:27	Whoa, all right?
306	00:20:27	00:20:30	Everybody just calm down, okay?
307	00:20:30	00:20:32	It's medicinal. I got a bad back, all right?
308	00:20:32	00:20:33	I got it at a dispensary.
309	00:20:33	00:20:35	I got my card in my wallet right here.
310	00:20:35	00:20:38	Keep your hands where we can see them.
311	00:20:38	00:20:41	Okay. This is Nevada, pal.
312	00:20:41	00:20:42	You want to play that, go back to Cali.
313	00:20:42	00:20:43	Going Back to Cali.
314	00:20:44	00:20:45	That's a good rap song.
315	00:20:45	00:20:48	Yeah, I'm channeling Notorious B.I.G., can't you tell?
316	00:20:48	00:20:51	Hey, Jim, go ahead and take High Times back to the station.
317	00:20:51	00:20:53	Nick and I are gonna get a little familiar with this place.
318	00:20:53	00:20:54	Oh, come on!
319	00:20:59	00:21:01	I've got a box saw over here.
320	00:21:01	00:21:04	It's the same type of saw used to cut off the victim's head.
321	00:21:15	00:21:18	I think we just found the victim's head remover.
322	00:21:27	00:21:29	Got some more blood over here.
323	00:21:29	00:21:32	Trail looks like it goes outside.
324	00:21:42	00:21:44	See that... right there?
325	00:21:46	00:21:48	Then it kind of stops.
326	00:22:06	00:22:09	Positive for blood.
327	00:22:10	00:22:11	C.O.D.
328	00:22:11	00:22:12	is gunshot to the chest.
329	00:22:12	00:22:14	This could be where Ronald Tobin was killed.
330	00:22:16	00:22:18	Medium velocity spatter.
331	00:22:19	00:22:21	Could be from an exiting bullet.
332	00:22:31	00:22:33	Nine millimeter.
333	00:22:33	00:22:35	Remington Golden Saber.
334	00:22:39	00:22:41	There's a trail of wood splinters.
335	00:22:43	00:22:45	Somebody was dragging something made of wood.
336	00:22:54	00:22:55	You recognize that smell?
337	00:22:56	00:22:59	Yes, ma'am. Unfortunately.
338	00:23:03	00:23:06	Staphylinidae beetles.
339	00:23:06	00:23:08	Clean up crew.
340	00:23:32	00:23:34	Who's that?
341	00:23:34	00:23:36	That you?
342	00:23:36	00:23:39	Can you see through those slits, buddy?
343	00:23:39	00:23:40	Yeah, man.
344	00:23:40	00:23:42	I was knocking over pins for Ron Ron.
345	00:23:42	00:23:46	He called me up, said he was bowling against some pro and he needed my help.
346	00:23:46	00:23:47	So, you were cheating for him?
347	00:23:47	00:23:48	Yeah.
348	00:23:48	00:23:49	20 bucks a pin.
349	00:23:49	00:23:52	I knocked over, like, ten that night.
350	00:23:52	00:23:54	(clicks tongue) It's easy money.
351	00:23:54	00:23:55	It was easy money for your drug dealer.
352	00:23:55	00:23:57	'Cause everything you get goes to him.
353	00:23:57	00:24:02	Right? Unless, Ron Ron wasn't breaking you off with your paycheck on time?
354	00:24:02	00:24:03	Of course he did.
355	00:24:03	00:24:05	He was a stand-up dude.
356	00:24:05	00:24:06	Stand-up dudes don't cheat.
357	00:24:06	00:24:08	He only was doing this to impress his girl Shea.
358	00:24:08	00:24:10	Stand-up dudes don't steal.
359	00:24:10	00:24:12	He only stole that stuff because he was a fan.
360	00:24:12	00:24:14	I never seen him sell any of it.
361	00:24:14	00:24:17	Well, maybe you were selling it, and you didn't cut him in on his action.
362	00:24:17	00:24:21	You... you think I killed him?
363	00:24:21	00:24:23	You were caught sleeping in Ronald's car.
364	00:24:23	00:24:25	He was shot, he had his head cut off.
365	00:24:26	00:24:31	He was thrown away like a piece of garbage, and all this happened at your place of employment.
366	00:24:31	00:24:33	And you're telling me you didn't know anything about it?
367	00:24:33	00:24:35	No, I didn't.
368	00:24:35	00:24:41	Look, I may be a-a-a broke, homeless druggie, but I ain't no killer.
369	00:24:47	00:24:49	Okay.
370	00:24:49	00:24:51	That should do it.
371	00:25:13	00:25:15	This is the bullet's true path.
372	00:25:16	00:25:19	Shot came from the backyard.
373	00:25:19	00:25:21	Yes.
374	00:25:21	00:25:28	And with any luck, this overhang will have protected this area from the elements.
375	00:25:28	00:25:31	Maybe we can still get GSR.
376	00:25:39	00:25:42	Don't you put your hands on me! That's enough!
377	00:25:50	00:25:56	Well, the sister told the truth about one thing-- she was exactly where she said she was.
378	00:25:58	00:26:02	Autopsy confirms that the victim died of a single gunshot wound through the left lung.
379	00:26:02	00:26:05	All of the blood at the scene was from our victim.
380	00:26:05	00:26:07	No hits on the bullet and no prints on the saw.
381	00:26:07	00:26:12	There were two sets of prints on the bloody roller bag-- the victim's and Kevin X's.
382	00:26:12	00:26:15	Kevin X.
383	00:26:15	00:26:21	Okay, we know that the victim and his pal Vitas were partners in crime, stealing whatever they could get their hands on.
384	00:26:21	00:26:25	But if these two guys are the best we got, I'm a little worried.
385	00:26:25	00:26:30	Both of them were at the front of the lanes when Ronald's head popped out-- Kevin was bowling, Vitas was in the crowd.
386	00:26:30	00:26:33	I mean, how could either one of them have put the head in the ball pit?
387	00:26:33	00:26:38	You're right about Kevin-- he was bowling the whole time, and we have the footage to prove it. Which leaves Vitas.
388	00:26:38	00:26:44	Is it possible that he put the head in the ball pit and made it around to the front of the lanes in time?
389	00:26:44	00:26:48	And obviously it's going to take a little longer for a ball to make it back to the return if it's pushing a human head.
390	00:26:49	00:26:50	It also depends on the pinsetter.
391	00:26:50	00:26:52	Some are faster than others.
392	00:26:52	00:26:59	The automated scoring computer clocked 47.
393	00:26:59	00:27:02	The head appeared in the return just 18 seconds later.
394	00:27:02	00:27:10	So, you're telling me that Vitas dropped the head in the ball pit and then made it all the way back around to the front of Chevy's lane in 18 seconds?
395	00:27:12	00:27:14	I don't know if weed head could've pulled that off.
396	00:27:14	00:27:17	I mean, look at him.
397	00:27:18	00:27:20	Well, there's only one way to find out.
398	00:27:31	00:27:32	Are you ready?
399	00:27:38	00:27:39	It's in.
400	00:27:58	00:28:00	13 seconds.
401	00:28:00	00:28:02	(panting) Good job.
402	00:28:05	00:28:07	It's five seconds faster than the pinsetter.
403	00:28:07	00:28:09	I don't know, man.
404	00:28:09	00:28:11	Add in the crowd, it's doable.
405	00:28:11	00:28:13	Even for Vitas.
406	00:28:16	00:28:19	This is the raw broadcast footage of the tournament.
407	00:28:19	00:28:22	We have all the camera angles.
408	00:28:22	00:28:25	So, this is the moment that Ronald's head appeared.
409	00:28:27	00:28:29	And there's Vitas.
410	00:28:29	00:28:31	Back it up.
411	00:28:31	00:28:33	Let's see where he came from.
412	00:28:33	00:28:35	This is a few moments prior.
413	00:28:35	00:28:37	And Vitas doesn't move.
414	00:28:37	00:28:39	He stayed there the entire time.
415	00:28:40	00:28:43	But the vic's girlfriend is moving.
416	00:28:43	00:28:44	Do you have a wider angle?
417	00:28:47	00:28:50	Can you zoom in, track her movement?
418	00:28:50	00:28:52	Yep.
419	00:28:58	00:29:01	She's coming from the back side of the lanes.
420	00:29:01	00:29:04	And apparently she's one hell of an actress.
421	00:29:09	00:29:11	So are you sure you're going to be okay with her?
422	00:29:11	00:29:12	Oh, yeah. I love them when they're this age.
423	00:29:12	00:29:15	Hello. Hey, you want to be in CODIS?
424	00:29:18	00:29:21	Let's go play with CODIS. Okay, we can play...
425	00:29:22	00:29:23	Right this way.
426	00:29:25	00:29:28	Go ahead and have a seat.
427	00:29:30	00:29:33	So?
428	00:29:33	00:29:35	You said you had some information about my sister.
429	00:29:35	00:29:41	Actually, it's about your sister's husband, James York.
430	00:29:41	00:29:44	We were able to determine that she didn't kill him.
431	00:29:44	00:29:47	What good is that going to do her now? There's no point.
432	00:29:47	00:29:49	You killed him.
433	00:29:49	00:29:51	Didn't you, Hannah?
434	00:29:51	00:29:53	James York liked to play around.
435	00:29:53	00:29:55	I suspect that he was playing around with you.
436	00:29:55	00:30:02	And maybe you didn't intend to kill him, but after you shot him, you never thought your sister would go down for it.
437	00:30:02	00:30:05	Now, we know you didn't try to frame her.
438	00:30:05	00:30:08	That was just an accident of bullets and geometry.
439	00:30:08	00:30:11	The D.A. is going to press charges.
440	00:30:11	00:30:14	Just come clean now.
441	00:30:25	00:30:26	Thank you.
442	00:30:27	00:30:29	Hannah...
443	00:30:31	00:30:35	...spare yourself the trouble and the pain of going through another trial.
444	00:30:36	00:30:42	Would it make any difference if you knew that James York was a piece of garbage?
445	00:30:42	00:30:44	I wouldn't have touched him with a ten foot pole.
446	00:30:44	00:30:48	You know he had three other children with other women.
447	00:30:48	00:30:51	Sweet little kids he'd already managed to screw up.
448	00:30:54	00:30:59	I loved my sister, but she was never very bright.
449	00:30:59	00:31:03	And she was an idiot to stay with a man like that.
450	00:31:03	00:31:05	Their daughter...
451	00:31:05	00:31:07	my daughter...
452	00:31:07	00:31:10	is two years old now.
453	00:31:10	00:31:13	And I tell her that I love her every day.
454	00:31:13	00:31:17	And she knows I really mean it.
455	00:31:17	00:31:21	Whoever killed James York did her a favor.
456	00:31:25	00:31:28	That should make a difference.
457	00:31:29	00:31:33	It's not for me to judge.
458	00:31:33	00:31:36	You're going to have to go with this officer now.
459	00:31:56	00:32:02	Did you go behind the lanes the night that Ronald was killed?
460	00:32:02	00:32:04	Mm-mmm.
461	00:32:04	00:32:06	Oh. That.
462	00:32:06	00:32:10	That was when I ran to my car to get my birth control pills.
463	00:32:10	00:32:13	And you were running because...?
464	00:32:13	00:32:15	Well, because I didn't want to miss the match.
465	00:32:15	00:32:16	I wanted to find out who won.
466	00:32:18	00:32:24	Ms. Lammet, I found this in your apartment.
467	00:32:24	00:32:27	This is the hot designer bag of the moment.
468	00:32:27	00:32:29	Every woman wants one, including me, but...
469	00:32:29	00:32:32	we just don't make that kind of money.
470	00:32:32	00:32:33	What's your secret, Shea?
471	00:32:33	00:32:36	It was a gift.
472	00:32:36	00:32:37	From Ronny?
473	00:32:37	00:32:39	Your boyfriend makes less than you do.
474	00:32:39	00:32:42	Oh, but you know, it could be from his side biz.
475	00:32:42	00:32:44	Except...
476	00:32:44	00:32:48	this bag has been slashed with a razor, and totally ruined.
477	00:32:50	00:32:52	No woman I know would do this to this bag.
478	00:32:52	00:32:56	And if a guy is splurging on something like this, he's not going to destroy it.
479	00:32:56	00:32:57	Who did you get it from?
480	00:33:04	00:33:06	Chevy Cigs gave it to me.
481	00:33:06	00:33:08	You know, the famous bowler.
482	00:33:08	00:33:10	Yeah. Yeah, we know him.
483	00:33:10	00:33:12	How did you meet him?
484	00:33:12	00:33:14	I served him at the alley a couple times.
485	00:33:14	00:33:18	He lives in the area, so he would come in to practice.
486	00:33:18	00:33:20	You started dating?
487	00:33:22	00:33:24	We fell in love, actually.
488	00:33:26	00:33:28	So, what happened, Chev?
489	00:33:28	00:33:31	So, you meet cute little Shea at the bowling alley, right?
490	00:33:31	00:33:33	And you're itching to roll your balls down another lane.
491	00:33:33	00:33:35	You know what I mean?
492	00:33:35	00:33:37	So, you wine her, you dine her, you buy her.
493	00:33:37	00:33:43	Then the boyfriend finds out, and he slices up the purse you gave her, so the boyfriend's got to go?
494	00:33:43	00:33:47	Hey, I didn't kill anybody. You're the only one with a registered nine millimeter in the bowling alley.
495	00:33:47	00:33:48	Now, you know we searched your house.
496	00:33:48	00:33:54	We didn't find the weapon, but we found a box of Remington Golden Sabers, the same ammo used to kill Ronald Tobin.
497	00:33:54	00:33:56	So, where's the gun?
498	00:33:56	00:33:57	She must have stolen it from me.
499	00:33:58	00:33:59	So you're saying that Shea killed Ronald?
500	00:33:59	00:34:00	She had to, right?
501	00:34:00	00:34:02	Did she tell you that she killed Ronald?
502	00:34:02	00:34:03	No.
503	00:34:03	00:34:06	Look, I broke up with her because Ronald found out.
504	00:34:07	00:34:10	And I guess she was thinking, with Ronald gone, maybe I'd get back together with her.
505	00:34:10	00:34:15	You're telling me that Shea killed Ronald and cut his head off just to mess up your game?
506	00:34:15	00:34:17	She did that because she's nuts.
507	00:34:17	00:34:22	Because I didn't get back together with her, and I guess it's her idea of revenge.
508	00:34:24	00:34:26	That's the truth. I got nothing to hide.
509	00:34:26	00:34:28	I got a big match tonight.
510	00:34:28	00:34:31	Can I go now?
511	00:34:31	00:34:33	If Chevy's telling the truth...
512	00:34:33	00:34:36	then Shea did everything by herself.
513	00:34:36	00:34:37	It doesn't add up.
514	00:34:37	00:34:38	Let's see.
515	00:34:38	00:34:45	She shoots him, cuts off his head, picks him up, tosses him in a crate, then drags the crate across a parking lot.
516	00:34:45	00:34:50	And I think Ronald weighed about 180 pounds, minus his head.
517	00:34:50	00:34:52	Add the crate.
518	00:34:52	00:34:53	I'd say it's unlikely.
519	00:34:53	00:34:55	She must have had help.
520	00:36:00	00:36:03	The blood in the finger holes came from the victim.
521	00:36:03	00:36:08	The blood in the head was already dried by the time it was tossed into the ball pit.
522	00:36:08	00:36:10	Which means that it couldn't have splashed or spilled in there.
523	00:36:10	00:36:12	Right.
524	00:36:12	00:36:14	So we've got the victim's blood on Chevy's hands.
525	00:36:14	00:36:15	I think it came from his fingertips.
526	00:36:15	00:36:19	And I think that the smears were minute because he washed his hands.
527	00:36:19	00:36:23	I think he accidentally left blood under his nails, but...
528	00:36:23	00:36:27	did Chevy ever actually touch the bowling ball after he touched the head?
529	00:36:27	00:36:30	No, so, at the very least, we know that Chevy was involved.
530	00:36:30	00:36:34	It's just so weird, because you didn't find blood on any of his personal effects.
531	00:36:34	00:36:37	Not his shoes, clothes, towel, gloves, just nothing.
532	00:36:37	00:36:39	He had to have tossed everything.
533	00:36:39	00:36:41	I mean, clothes are replaceable.
534	00:36:41	00:36:43	His lucky ball isn't.
535	00:36:46	00:36:51	Well, it's been a crazy turn of events, but we're finally gonna find out who wins this tournament.
536	00:36:51	00:36:53	Final frame, final throw, for the championship.
537	00:36:53	00:36:57	Yeah, Chevy needs to knock this field goal down for the win, J.T.
538	00:36:57	00:37:00	If he misses, X-Man takes his first against Chevy.
539	00:37:00	00:37:01	Here we go.
540	00:37:01	00:37:03	Look at the determination.
541	00:37:03	00:37:04	All comes down to this, folks.
542	00:37:04	00:37:05	He needs a miracle.
543	00:37:11	00:37:13	Chevy, you're under arrest.
544	00:37:13	00:37:15	Drop the ball.
545	00:37:15	00:37:17	Oh, this cannot be happening. Come on.
546	00:37:17	00:37:18	Get on your knees.
547	00:37:27	00:37:29	(cheering) Yes!
548	00:37:33	00:37:35	You just lost.
549	00:37:35	00:37:37	So did you.
550	00:37:37	00:37:40	How's it feel to be ratted out by your own bowling ball?
551	00:37:46	00:37:48	What the hell am I still doing here?
552	00:37:48	00:37:50	I've told you everything I know.
553	00:37:50	00:37:52	No, you didn't, but Chevy did.
554	00:37:52	00:37:53	Sit.
555	00:37:53	00:37:55	What did he tell you?
556	00:37:55	00:38:01	That you killed Ronald, decapitated him and threw his head in the ball pit.
557	00:38:01	00:38:02	That's what he said.
558	00:38:02	00:38:03	No, he didn't.
559	00:38:03	00:38:06	Shea, this is your life.
560	00:38:06	00:38:07	Sit down.
561	00:38:07	00:38:10	If Chevy's lying, you need to tell me.
562	00:38:10	00:38:14	Otherwise, he's going to continue to win bowling titles while you rot in a cell.
563	00:38:15	00:38:18	Look, I didn't shoot Ronald.
564	00:38:18	00:38:20	Then who did?
565	00:38:22	00:38:29	When Ronny found out about Chevy, he got a gun, and he forced me to lure Chevy to SSB.
566	00:38:29	00:38:34	He said he was just trying to scare him, but I didn't know.
567	00:38:34	00:38:36	I got completely freaked.
568	00:38:36	00:38:41	So, I just did what he wanted, and I told Chevy that I was stranded.
569	00:38:41	00:38:44	Hey, bro, get out of the truck.
570	00:38:44	00:38:45	Get that gun out of my face.
571	00:38:45	00:38:46	Get out of the truck! Ronny, don't!
572	00:38:46	00:38:53	You're gonna get out of the truck, I'm gonna call your wife, and you're gonna tell her what a scumbag you are, and how you been banging my chick.
573	00:38:53	00:38:54	Ronny, put the gun down.
574	00:38:54	00:38:55	Shut up. No.
575	00:38:55	00:38:57	Oh, my God!
576	00:38:57	00:38:58	Oh, my God, Chevy!
577	00:38:59	00:39:00	You set me up!
578	00:39:00	00:39:02	I ought to kill you, too!
579	00:39:02	00:39:03	I'm sorry, Chevy. I'm sorry.
580	00:39:03	00:39:05	We got to get rid of this body.
581	00:39:05	00:39:08	So, come on, pick him up. Come on, come on, come on.
582	00:39:08	00:39:09	Okay, okay.
583	00:39:09	00:39:12	Come on, lift higher.
584	00:39:12	00:39:14	Come on, push!
585	00:39:15	00:39:16	We're over.
586	00:39:20	00:39:22	Say a word, and we both go down.
587	00:39:22	00:39:24	Oh, my God...
588	00:39:26	00:39:29	Ronny promised me that he was gonna marry me.
589	00:39:29	00:39:33	15 years later, I still have the same last name.
590	00:39:33	00:39:38	Chevy promised me the same thing, just so he could keep getting laid.
591	00:39:38	00:39:41	I was just fed up.
592	00:39:43	00:39:48	I wanted to give Chevy something that he would never forget.
593	00:39:57	00:40:03	It's shocking enough to find a human head in the ball rack...
594	00:40:05	00:40:11	...but when it's the head of someone that you killed-- unforgettable.
595	00:40:19	00:40:23	So, um, what are we looking at here?
596	00:40:25	00:40:26	Jail-time-wise? What...?
597	00:40:26	00:40:28	What am I looking at?
598	00:40:28	00:40:30	I mean, I didn't actually kill anybody.
599	00:40:30	00:40:36	No, but cutting the head off of your dead boyfriend is not going to get you a lot of sympathy from a jury.
600	00:40:36	00:40:39	Right, yeah.
601	00:40:39	00:40:41	But I mean, I'll get out some day, right?
602	00:40:43	00:40:46	And Chevy-- it was just self-defense.
603	00:40:47	00:40:49	He could get out even before I do.
604	00:40:49	00:40:51	You might be right about that.
605	00:40:54	00:40:56	By then, I mean, he could have forgiven me.
606	00:40:59	00:41:02	Maybe we'll get to be together after all.
607	00:41:09	00:41:10	Ooh!
608	00:41:12	00:41:14	I had it. I almost had it and I hate this.
609	00:41:14	00:41:15	I hate it.
610	00:41:15	00:41:17	Happens every single time.
611	00:41:17	00:41:18	No more.
612	00:41:18	00:41:22	Aw, come on. You know, don't be afraid to rock the granny roll, Cath.
613	00:41:22	00:41:24	Always works for me.
614	00:41:26	00:41:27	Are you coming?
615	00:41:27	00:41:28	The party's already started.
616	00:41:28	00:41:30	You better hurry.
617	00:41:30	00:41:31	You're coming up soon.
618	00:41:31	00:41:34	Yeah, Sara, I'm here, I'm here.
619	00:41:34	00:41:35	I'm just getting my shoes.
620	00:41:35	00:41:36	Size 13 and a half, please.
621	00:41:36	00:41:38	Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
622	00:41:39	00:41:40	My granny taught me that.
623	00:41:40	00:41:41	Uh-huh...
624	00:41:43	00:41:44	Langston's here, everybody.
625	00:41:44	00:41:46	Sara, that pin is flipping you off.
626	00:41:48	00:41:49	Nothing but strikes, Doc!
627	00:41:51	00:41:52	Nice hook.
628	00:41:57	00:41:58	He's the sexiest.
629	00:41:58	00:42:00	There he is. Time for a toast.
630	00:42:00	00:42:01	Cold one?
631	00:42:01	00:42:03	Yo, bowling is a family sport.
632	00:42:03	00:42:07	I would like to raise a glass to our CSI family.
633	00:42:07	00:42:08	Cheers.
634	00:42:08	00:42:11	Cheers! Yeah!
635	00:42:11	00:42:13	Cheers. Cheers.
636	00:42:13	00:42:14	Cheers.
637	00:42:16	00:42:20	But unfortunately, it's time to give the family a little ass whooping.
638	00:42:21	00:42:23	Ouch! Oh, really! All of us?
639	00:42:23	00:42:24	Just pay attention, Nick.
640	00:42:24	00:42:27	Be careful you don't let your mouth write a check that your ass can't cash.
641	00:42:27	00:42:29	(everyone laughing) Ooh!
642	00:42:31	00:42:34	Oh! Nice!
643	00:42:35	00:42:36	Wow. All right.
644	00:42:36	00:42:38	Yeah!
645	00:42:38	00:42:39	(laughs) He's on my team.
646	00:42:39	00:42:42	I told them 13 and a half.
647	00:42:42	00:42:44	Wrong size.
648	00:42:44	00:42:46	Be right back. Hurry up.
649	00:42:47	00:42:48	Hey, sorry I'm late.
650	00:42:48	00:42:51	I couldn't find my ball.
651	00:42:51	00:42:53	You have a ball? Yeah.
652	00:42:53	00:42:54	And a bag. It's a purse!
653	00:42:54	00:42:55	(laughter) Check it out!
654	00:42:55	00:42:57	Did your grandmother give you that bag?
655	00:42:57	00:42:59	Time out. I thought you weren't gonna bowl.
656	00:42:59	00:43:00	Yeah, I changed my mind.
657	00:43:00	00:43:02	Somebody's rearview mirror's a little lighter.
658	00:43:03	00:43:03	Is that legal?!
659	00:43:04	00:43:06	Don't be scared.
660	00:43:11	00:43:13	(cheering and applause) I owe you nothing.
661	00:43:15	00:43:17	Oh, all right, it's on, it's on.
662	00:43:17	00:43:20	All right... so what was that about an ass whooping?
