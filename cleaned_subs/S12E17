0	00:00:28	00:00:30	Yo, Gossip Girl! Slow down!
1	00:00:30	00:00:33	Who'd you piss off now? Not now, Jake.
2	00:00:33	00:00:36	Well, if you're looking for our girlfriend, okay, you just missed her.
3	00:00:48	00:00:49	Aren't you Brooke Cassidy?
4	00:00:49	00:00:51	That's me.
5	00:00:52	00:00:53	So, you really a virgin?
6	00:00:57	00:00:59	You forgot your number.
7	00:00:59	00:01:00	I could be your first time!
8	00:01:21	00:01:25	Yeah! Whoo! Yeah!
9	00:01:26	00:01:29	Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink!
10	00:01:29	00:01:30	How did I let you get me into this?
11	00:01:30	00:01:31	Come on! Drink, drink!
12	00:01:31	00:01:35	Ladies, got a room upstairs.
13	00:01:35	00:01:37	Get off of me!
14	00:01:41	00:01:42	Babe.
15	00:01:44	00:01:46	Uh, you find your little, uh, BFF?
16	00:01:46	00:01:47	Oh, let it go.
17	00:01:47	00:01:49	I'm sorry, I meant GBF.
18	00:01:49	00:01:51	Gay Best Friend. (chuckles)
19	00:01:56	00:01:58	Stop! (grunts)
20	00:01:58	00:02:00	I'm sorry, I left my purity ring in my room.
21	00:02:00	00:02:01	You want to come help me look for it?
22	00:02:04	00:02:05	Bye.
23	00:02:18	00:02:20	We're trending!
24	00:03:03	00:03:08	So, 00 a.m.
25	00:03:08	00:03:09	Dead body.
26	00:03:09	00:03:11	An anonymous tip gave us the location.
27	00:03:11	00:03:14	Who invited the campus? I know, they keep coming.
28	00:03:14	00:03:15	It's like moths to a flame.
29	00:03:15	00:03:17	Anyway, this place is notorious.
30	00:03:17	00:03:19	It's called Finals Bridge.
31	00:03:19	00:03:21	32 feet down to a broken neck.
32	00:03:21	00:03:29	So a big suicide spot? Well, used to be till the university closed it down five years ago. Anyway, I got to get back to take statements from the first responders.
33	00:03:31	00:03:33	Hey, what do you got?
34	00:03:33	00:03:35	Well, I got a beer bottle.
35	00:03:35	00:03:37	Well, that's something. Mm-hmm.
36	00:03:37	00:03:39	Still wet, so it's recent.
37	00:03:39	00:03:44	Yeah, and I got some sediment disturbances here on the ground.
38	00:03:44	00:03:46	And then up here...
39	00:03:46	00:03:48	base of the lamppost.
40	00:03:48	00:03:51	Two different sets of shoe prints here.
41	00:03:51	00:03:54	They're not distinct, but it looks to me like there might have been a struggle?
42	00:03:54	00:03:56	Yeah. Well, there's more...
43	00:03:56	00:04:00	here... on the ledge.
44	00:04:01	00:04:03	Doesn't look like he jumped.
45	00:04:05	00:04:08	Maybe someone pushed this kid over the edge.
46	00:04:48	00:04:50	All right.
47	00:04:53	00:04:55	Ow.
48	00:04:55	00:04:57	You okay? Yeah.
49	00:04:57	00:05:00	Nothing that a chiropractor can't fix.
50	00:05:01	00:05:04	Five call-outs today.
51	00:05:04	00:05:07	Not one died some place where I'm not risking my life.
52	00:05:07	00:05:10	Yeah, well it sounds like it's been a rough night for everybody, especially this guy.
53	00:05:10	00:05:13	And you can smell it. He's had more than just a couple of beers.
54	00:05:13	00:05:16	Long night of partying. Things got out of hand.
55	00:05:16	00:05:20	Student looky-loos say they last saw him at the Theta Delta party.
56	00:05:22	00:05:25	Student I.D. says Pete Moyer, sophomore.
57	00:05:25	00:05:27	Has he got a cell phone on him, Super Dave?
58	00:05:27	00:05:30	No, not on him.
59	00:05:30	00:05:33	College kid without a cell phone, that doesn't happen.
60	00:05:33	00:05:35	Antemortem bruising on the face.
61	00:05:35	00:05:37	Yeah, from a fight maybe.
62	00:05:39	00:05:40	Skull's crushed.
63	00:05:40	00:05:42	It's consistent with the fall.
64	00:05:42	00:05:43	Yeah, he didn't drop straight down.
65	00:05:43	00:05:48	Trajectory says, he had some momentum when he came off the bridge.
66	00:05:51	00:05:54	Suggests a push.
67	00:05:54	00:05:57	Maybe it was from the same person that messed up his face.
68	00:06:07	00:06:11	What are you doing, taking candids of our crowd?
69	00:06:11	00:06:14	You never know if the suspect might return to the scene.
70	00:06:14	00:06:15	Out of feelings of guilt?
71	00:06:15	00:06:17	Maybe they want to enjoy the show.
72	00:06:21	00:06:24	Ah, person of interest.
73	00:06:24	00:06:25	Oh, yeah. (chuckles)
74	00:06:27	00:06:28	Charlie.
75	00:06:28	00:06:30	Giving the girls trouble?
76	00:06:30	00:06:33	Between school and basketball, I don't really have much time.
77	00:06:33	00:06:34	It's good to see you, Finn.
78	00:06:34	00:06:35	It's really good to see you.
79	00:06:35	00:06:37	And Dad said you two were working together again.
80	00:06:37	00:06:39	Yes, we are.
81	00:06:39	00:06:40	So when are we going to play tennis?
82	00:06:40	00:06:42	Think you can finally beat me?
83	00:06:42	00:06:44	Ah, yeah, good luck with that, buddy.
84	00:06:44	00:06:45	How come you're not in class?
85	00:06:45	00:06:47	00 a.m.
86	00:06:47	00:06:50	Besides, everybody's talking about this. Yeah. I noticed that.
87	00:06:50	00:06:51	How'd they get here so quickly?
88	00:06:51	00:06:54	Um, it's trending.
89	00:06:54	00:06:56	What? Can I see that?
90	00:06:56	00:06:58	57 a.m.
91	00:06:58	00:07:00	User name Voyeur4U.
92	00:07:00	00:07:01	57.
93	00:07:01	00:07:05	00.
94	00:07:05	00:07:09	That means this Voyuer4U guy knew about the body before the cops or anybody else.
95	00:07:09	00:07:10	So this guy could be our killer.
96	00:07:10	00:07:12	The dude wanted to post and boast.
97	00:07:14	00:07:15	Just saying.
98	00:07:15	00:07:17	That is a good theory.
99	00:07:19	00:07:21	Must run in the blood.
100	00:07:24	00:07:26	What can you tell me, Doc?
101	00:07:26	00:07:30	Well, our young man's skull fracture was accompanied by a fracture to the C1 vertebra.
102	00:07:30	00:07:32	Severed the spinal cord.
103	00:07:32	00:07:35	Injuries were debilitating and fatal.
104	00:07:35	00:07:36	What about the antemortem injuries?
105	00:07:36	00:07:43	Well, besides the split lip and contusions, he suffered a fracture to the zygomatic arch.
106	00:07:43	00:07:45	Also the nasal cartilage.
107	00:07:45	00:07:47	And there was blood in the nares, the nostrils.
108	00:07:47	00:07:49	He really took a beating.
109	00:07:49	00:07:51	Contusions take around six hours to set.
110	00:07:51	00:07:54	00 a.m., 00 p.m.
111	00:07:54	00:07:56	And there were no defensive wounds.
112	00:08:02	00:08:03	The fight was one-sided.
113	00:08:06	00:08:08	Somebody really had it in for this kid.
114	00:08:12	00:08:17	All right, so, the autopsy says 00 p.m.
115	00:08:17	00:08:22	We didn't find any blood on his clothes from a fight but, Nick and Greg did find bloody clothes in his dorm room.
116	00:08:22	00:08:26	And apart from the clothes, the room was completely empty.
117	00:08:26	00:08:27	What do you mean?
118	00:08:27	00:08:31	Apparently, a bunch of students went in there and helped themselves to his stuff.
119	00:08:31	00:08:32	You're kidding me. Yeah.
120	00:08:32	00:08:34	Isn't that disgusting?
121	00:08:34	00:08:42	So, Pete, last night, gets into a fight, goes back to his dorm room, changes his clothes and then he goes the Theta Delta party.
122	00:08:42	00:08:48	Yeah, where, maybe, he runs into the guy that he had the fight with, and then the fight continues, and ends on the bridge.
123	00:08:48	00:08:50	Okay, so...
124	00:08:50	00:08:52	sounds like we need to know more about this party.
125	00:08:52	00:08:57	Oh, yeah, what about this Voyuer4U guy who posted the photo?
126	00:08:57	00:08:59	Yeah, Archie's working on it right now.
127	00:08:59	00:09:02	Yeah, please, make yourself a home.
128	00:09:02	00:09:04	Thank you. I can't believe...
129	00:09:06	00:09:08	Hey, Archie.
130	00:09:08	00:09:11	What do you got? Running an ISP trace on Voyeur4U.
131	00:09:11	00:09:13	Still waiting. Are these from the Theta party?
132	00:09:13	00:09:16	Yeah. Going through all the posted photos looking for Pete.
133	00:09:16	00:09:21	No luck yet, but, uh, still got another 1,367 photos to go.
134	00:09:21	00:09:22	Oh, great. What do you have?
135	00:09:22	00:09:25	Pete Moyer's FriendAgenda page.
136	00:09:25	00:09:34	This guy lived out loud in more ways than one-- openly gay, and he didn't pull any punches when it came to his feelings about others. What do you mean?
137	00:09:34	00:09:36	He kept a VLOG. Video blog.
138	00:09:36	00:09:39	Kind of like a campus version of Perez Hilton.
139	00:09:39	00:09:42	Pete posted juicy gossip about everybody on campus.
140	00:09:42	00:09:48	Everything from who's sleeping with whom, to whose spring break was more like spring rehab.
141	00:09:48	00:09:51	Okay, so sounds like this guy made a lot of enemies, right?
142	00:09:51	00:09:56	Oh, yeah, one in particular-- username Jonesin4.
143	00:09:56	00:09:58	Comments are full of homophobic slurs.
144	00:09:58	00:09:59	Some of 'em are kind of violent.
145	00:09:59	00:10:02	Like this one, posted last night.
146	00:10:02	00:10:04	Hey, Queer.
147	00:10:04	00:10:06	Stop gossiping and meet up with me, if you're man enough.
148	00:10:06	00:10:08	Or I'll find you.
149	00:10:08	00:10:10	Maybe this is a hate crime.
150	00:10:10	00:10:11	Hey, guys.
151	00:10:11	00:10:12	We got a hit on Voyeur4U.
152	00:10:12	00:10:13	Who is it?
153	00:10:15	00:10:16	Pete Moyer's account.
154	00:10:16	00:10:19	His death shot was posted from his own phone.
155	00:10:19	00:10:21	We didn't find his cell phone at the scene.
156	00:10:21	00:10:23	Maybe the killer picked it up, you know.
157	00:10:23	00:10:24	He might still have it.
158	00:10:24	00:10:25	Track the cell's GPS.
159	00:10:25	00:10:27	Already on it.
160	00:10:27	00:10:29	WLVU campus, Vincer Hall.
161	00:10:29	00:10:31	That dorm has five floors.
162	00:10:31	00:10:33	And I can track the current altitude of that cell phone.
163	00:10:33	00:10:34	You're kidding me.
164	00:10:34	00:10:37	2,061 feet above sea level.
165	00:10:37	00:10:39	So, in Vegas, that's about 27 feet above ground.
166	00:10:39	00:10:41	I'd say that's the third floor. Hey, Nick.
167	00:10:41	00:10:43	Yes, sir.
168	00:10:43	00:10:45	Yeah, we have a location on Pete Moyer's phone.
169	00:10:48	00:10:50	Room's clear.
170	00:10:50	00:10:52	Next one.
171	00:10:52	00:10:54	LVPD!
172	00:10:54	00:10:56	Open up! (window opening)
173	00:10:56	00:10:58	Get in there, Vaughn.
174	00:10:59	00:11:01	Don't leave out that window!
175	00:11:01	00:11:04	Get your hands off me!
176	00:11:04	00:11:05	Why you running, dude?
177	00:11:05	00:11:07	Resisting arrest-- not cool.
178	00:11:07	00:11:09	That must be Jonesin4.
179	00:11:11	00:11:13	I think I know for what.
180	00:11:13	00:11:17	Whatever you're jonesing for, this guy's got it.
181	00:11:17	00:11:19	Hey, try the number.
182	00:11:32	00:11:33	Pete's phone.
183	00:11:33	00:11:35	So you think this guy's Pete's killer?
184	00:11:35	00:11:37	I think we have a strong connection.
185	00:11:42	00:11:44	You guys got this so wrong.
186	00:11:47	00:11:51	Hey, Queer. Stop gossiping and meet up with me if you're man enough. Or I'll find you.
187	00:11:51	00:11:53	Now, it sounds to me like we've got it right.
188	00:11:53	00:11:55	You had it in for Pete.
189	00:11:55	00:11:57	So is that your thing-- you like to gay-bash?
190	00:11:57	00:12:01	The last person who'd bash Pete for being gay is me. Really?
191	00:12:01	00:12:02	Why is that?
192	00:12:02	00:12:05	Because I'm gay.
193	00:12:05	00:12:09	Hey, Queer and all that-- it's just the way we talk to each other.
194	00:12:09	00:12:11	It's kind of an us versus you thing.
195	00:12:11	00:12:15	Well, we have evidence that suggests a you versus Pete thing on the bridge last night.
196	00:12:15	00:12:19	We found a beer bottle with your DNA on it in the exact spot where somebody pushed Pete to his death.
197	00:12:19	00:12:21	Look, I didn't kill Pete.
198	00:12:21	00:12:22	Okay, you were on the bridge-- at least give me that much.
199	00:12:22	00:12:24	Yes, I admit that, I was on the bridge.
200	00:12:24	00:12:27	But only because he texted me.
201	00:12:27	00:12:29	He said he needed help.
202	00:12:29	00:12:31	Someone had done a number on him.
203	00:12:31	00:12:33	(phone ringing) Figured he was in trouble.
204	00:12:35	00:12:37	By the time I got there, he was dead.
205	00:12:37	00:12:39	Whatever happened on that bridge, I was too late.
206	00:12:41	00:12:43	Yeah, well, you're a really good friend, man.
207	00:12:43	00:12:50	You find him dead, you take his phone, you take his picture, and you post it to the Internet? Yeah, what, did you forget to call 911? I called.
208	00:12:50	00:12:51	When I got back to my room.
209	00:12:51	00:12:53	I told you where to find his body.
210	00:12:53	00:12:56	Posting that photo is what Pete would've wanted.
211	00:12:56	00:12:58	What's that supposed to mean?
212	00:12:58	00:13:00	Trend To The End.
213	00:13:00	00:13:06	All right, well, let's say that you were just the photographer, who do you suppose had it in for Pete?
214	00:13:06	00:13:08	Don't know who.
215	00:13:08	00:13:09	Might know why.
216	00:13:09	00:13:13	It's all about the scan-dahl.
217	00:13:13	00:13:14	What scandal?
218	00:13:14	00:13:16	Pete wouldn't tell me.
219	00:13:16	00:13:19	But he had some campus dirt that he was going to dish.
220	00:13:19	00:13:21	Total TMZ.
221	00:13:23	00:13:25	Love me, hate me.
222	00:13:29	00:13:31	privacy is history.
223	00:13:31	00:13:35	The eye in the sky sees all, shares all.
224	00:13:35	00:13:39	Now, if you can't own it, don't do it.
225	00:13:39	00:13:48	Now, sometimes this means making hard calls, hurting people close to you, but I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't tell all.
226	00:13:48	00:13:53	And this bomb that I'm about to drop...
227	00:13:53	00:13:57	it's gonna blow you away.
228	00:13:58	00:14:00	Got this off Pete's phone.
229	00:14:00	00:14:03	Thinking it was going to be his latest VLOG entry.
230	00:14:03	00:14:05	Or whatever his tell-all was.
231	00:14:05	00:14:08	I think I know what it could have been about.
232	00:14:08	00:14:12	I found these pictures of Pete talking to Brooke Cassidy, the actress.
233	00:14:12	00:14:13	Oh, more than an actress.
234	00:14:13	00:14:16	Brooke Cassidy is an industry.
235	00:14:16	00:14:19	Kids love her; parents love her even more. Yeah.
236	00:14:19	00:14:20	No sex, no drugs.
237	00:14:20	00:14:22	America's favorite virgin.
238	00:14:22	00:14:25	Tough act to keep up in college.
239	00:14:25	00:14:27	Yes, and maybe she didn't, and maybe Pete found out.
240	00:14:27	00:14:30	And here he is, giving her the heads-up.
241	00:14:30	00:14:33	Before he drops the bomb.
242	00:14:38	00:14:39	Excuse me, Ms. Cassidy.
243	00:14:39	00:14:41	We're from the Crime Lab.
244	00:14:41	00:14:43	This is CSI Brody. I'm CSI Finlay.
245	00:14:43	00:14:45	We're investigating Pete Moyer's death.
246	00:14:45	00:14:47	It's an awful thing. Yeah. Yeah, it is.
247	00:14:47	00:14:51	And according to Pete's VLOG, you guys were pretty good friends.
248	00:14:51	00:14:53	Yeah, that's right.
249	00:14:53	00:14:57	According to photos posted from the Theta party, you were one of the last people to see him.
250	00:14:57	00:14:59	I guess so.
251	00:14:59	00:15:01	What exactly can you tell us about his state of mind?
252	00:15:01	00:15:02	I don't know.
253	00:15:02	00:15:04	Pete was Pete.
254	00:15:04	00:15:05	What does that mean?
255	00:15:05	00:15:06	A hot mess.
256	00:15:06	00:15:08	Opinionated.
257	00:15:08	00:15:09	He could be cruel sometimes.
258	00:15:09	00:15:12	Was he ever cruel to you?
259	00:15:12	00:15:16	It seems like everybody wants to get ahead, so they'll say whatever they want about me, even if it's a total lie.
260	00:15:16	00:15:20	I came here to be a student, and I thought that Pete respected that.
261	00:15:20	00:15:25	And that would be important to a woman who had made a very public pledge of purity until marriage.
262	00:15:25	00:15:26	What are you implying?
263	00:15:26	00:15:31	We would just like to know what the two of you were talking about before someone pushed Pete off the bridge.
264	00:15:33	00:15:35	Whatever it was, you don't look happy.
265	00:15:37	00:15:39	Okay, I don't like where this is going.
266	00:15:39	00:15:40	I don't either.
267	00:15:40	00:15:42	And you are?
268	00:15:42	00:15:46	Jake Pychan, Theta Delta Zeta president.
269	00:15:46	00:15:48	Are these people giving you a hard time?
270	00:15:48	00:15:50	No. They're just asking questions about Pete.
271	00:15:50	00:15:52	Oh, I can tell you all you need to know.
272	00:15:52	00:15:53	Oh, great.
273	00:15:53	00:15:55	Pete Moyer was a leech.
274	00:15:55	00:15:59	A nobody who tried to be a somebody by posting lies.
275	00:15:59	00:16:00	I warned Brooke about him.
276	00:16:00	00:16:02	I can see you're very protective, Mr. President.
277	00:16:02	00:16:04	And busy.
278	00:16:04	00:16:06	I got a class to get to. So does Brooke.
279	00:16:10	00:16:12	Is that everything from Pete's room?
280	00:16:12	00:16:13	Almost.
281	00:16:13	00:16:15	Still haven't got his computer yet.
282	00:16:15	00:16:17	Oh, look at that.
283	00:16:17	00:16:20	Nice to see some things never change.
284	00:16:20	00:16:22	Instant ramen!
285	00:16:22	00:16:24	And a Crock-Pot.
286	00:16:24	00:16:26	Good times.
287	00:16:26	00:16:28	The kid had all kinds of electronica.
288	00:16:28	00:16:30	Cameras and microphones...
289	00:16:30	00:16:32	listening devices.
290	00:16:32	00:16:35	Took this whole paparazzi thing pretty seriously.
291	00:16:36	00:16:37	Yeah.
292	00:16:37	00:16:41	Like, A-plus seriously.
293	00:16:41	00:16:45	Pete wrote a term paper here called Phone Hacking for Hacks.
294	00:16:45	00:16:46	It's like a how-to guide.
295	00:16:46	00:16:47	Phone hacking for credit?
296	00:16:47	00:16:49	What kind of class teaches that?
297	00:16:49	00:16:52	Anthropology of Fame.
298	00:16:52	00:16:54	Taught by Professor Tom Laudner.
299	00:16:54	00:16:55	Tom Laudner?
300	00:16:55	00:16:56	I know that guy.
301	00:16:56	00:17:01	He has a tabloid TV show called Celebrities Indisposed.
302	00:17:01	00:17:03	He earns his living harassing celebrities.
303	00:17:03	00:17:06	And now he's teaching our kids, right?
304	00:17:06	00:17:08	Hester...
305	00:17:08	00:17:10	Prynne.
306	00:17:10	00:17:12	The Scarlet Letter.
307	00:17:12	00:17:18	I like to think of Hester as the first bad girl gone viral.
308	00:17:18	00:17:19	But that was then.
309	00:17:19	00:17:22	This... is now.
310	00:17:22	00:17:28	Today, the scarlet letter-- it gets you a book deal, it gets you a product line, it gets you a reality show.
311	00:17:28	00:17:31	Fame is good.
312	00:17:31	00:17:32	But...
313	00:17:32	00:17:39	without the judgment of the church or the community, what's left to keep us in line?
314	00:17:39	00:17:41	Hmm?
315	00:17:41	00:17:46	Gossip, fear, ridicule, shame.
316	00:17:46	00:17:49	Gossip is good.
317	00:17:49	00:17:50	Gossip works...
318	00:17:50	00:17:53	for society.
319	00:17:59	00:18:01	Wow. That was a great lecture.
320	00:18:01	00:18:03	Professor Laudner, right?
321	00:18:03	00:18:05	Mmm, yes. Well, I'm glad you could make it.
322	00:18:05	00:18:06	Uh, the police, right?
323	00:18:06	00:18:07	Uh... CSI.
324	00:18:07	00:18:09	D.B. Russell.
325	00:18:09	00:18:10	Oh, nice to meet you. Yeah. You too.
326	00:18:10	00:18:13	Yeah. I presume this is about Pete Moyer, yeah?
327	00:18:13	00:18:16	Yeah, yeah. He was one of your students, right?
328	00:18:16	00:18:18	He was my best student. Yeah, I could tell that.
329	00:18:18	00:18:20	You know, I saw some of his course work.
330	00:18:20	00:18:22	Especially that paper on phone hacking.
331	00:18:22	00:18:24	That was a good one.
332	00:18:24	00:18:26	Well, maybe not so good for Pete.
333	00:18:26	00:18:30	See, I think he may have tried to hack the wrong phone.
334	00:18:30	00:18:33	Well, I mean, I couldn't tell you anything about that.
335	00:18:33	00:18:40	No. Well... I mean this is a classroom and, you know, we just try to create a safe environment for students to pursue their intellectual muse.
336	00:18:40	00:18:41	Oh, I'm confused.
337	00:18:41	00:18:43	I thought you taught a class on gossip.
338	00:18:43	00:18:47	Oh, no, no, no, no-- I teach a course on the sociology of celebrity; the culture of idolatry.
339	00:18:47	00:18:56	I mean, college is to prepare students for the real world, right? The campus is a microcosm for society-- you got the haves, you got the have-nots, you've got the beautiful people, and the, uh...
340	00:18:56	00:18:57	you know, not-so-beautiful people.
341	00:18:57	00:19:01	And you got a real world actress playing student too, right? Yeah.
342	00:19:01	00:19:03	Brooke Cassidy? Fabulous girl.
343	00:19:03	00:19:08	Yeah, she was kind enough to serve as an object lesson in one of my lectures. That was kind of her.
344	00:19:08	00:19:12	'Cause the way I hear it, she's, like, this scandal waiting to happen. Yeah.
345	00:19:12	00:19:13	Teen Dream deflowered.
346	00:19:13	00:19:16	It'd obviously make a good story.
347	00:19:16	00:19:18	Hey, did you have Pete try to hack into some of that? Pete? No, no, no, no.
348	00:19:18	00:19:22	He's one of my students, he's not one of my employees. (laughs)
349	00:19:22	00:19:24	Right. Right, right, right.
350	00:19:24	00:19:27	Listen, what I can tell you about Pete...
351	00:19:27	00:19:31	as out as he was, he kept a few things in the closet.
352	00:19:33	00:19:35	That's as close as you'll get to an exclusive from me.
353	00:19:35	00:19:37	Okay. I hope you return the favor.
354	00:19:37	00:19:40	Oh, hey, thank you so much. That was very helpful. No, no, no, thank you.
355	00:19:40	00:19:43	Nice to meet you, sir. Take care. Yeah, you, too.
356	00:19:43	00:19:45	Good luck. Thanks.
357	00:19:52	00:19:54	What are we looking for exactly?
358	00:19:54	00:20:02	Oh, you know, something besides a computer or a hard drive where Pete could've stored whatever dirt he dug up on Brooke Cassidy.
359	00:20:02	00:20:04	You sure the professor's not just messing with you?
360	00:20:04	00:20:06	He was pretty clear about the quid pro quo.
361	00:20:10	00:20:12	I think I...
362	00:20:12	00:20:14	may have just found the quid.
363	00:20:14	00:20:16	I got to get me one of those.
364	00:20:22	00:20:24	Flash drive.
365	00:20:24	00:20:25	Let's check it out.
366	00:20:32	00:20:33	Okay.
367	00:20:35	00:20:37	Let's see what's in Brooke's folder.
368	00:20:41	00:20:44	Wow. Okay, so Pete wasn't just hacking messages.
369	00:20:44	00:20:46	He was hacking into e-mails and photos.
370	00:20:46	00:20:47	Mm-hmm.
371	00:20:49	00:20:52	America's favorite virgin's looking pretty virginal.
372	00:20:52	00:20:54	There's nothing really controversial here.
373	00:20:54	00:20:56	Let's check Jake's file.
374	00:21:08	00:21:09	Okay, wait a minute now.
375	00:21:11	00:21:13	I've seen that tatt before.
376	00:21:13	00:21:17	Where? Climbing out a window at WLVU.
377	00:21:19	00:21:20	That's Sebastian Jones.
378	00:21:20	00:21:23	One of Pete Moyer's buddies.
379	00:21:23	00:21:24	Hmm.
380	00:21:26	00:21:27	Whoa.
381	00:21:27	00:21:29	Looks like he's got another buddy.
382	00:21:29	00:21:32	That's Brooke's boyfriend, Jake Pychan.
383	00:21:32	00:21:35	Looks like boyfriend's got a beard.
384	00:21:42	00:21:44	Where did you get these?
385	00:21:44	00:21:48	Not off the computer you stole from Pete Moyer's dorm room, if that's what you mean.
386	00:21:48	00:21:50	We found his computer under your bed.
387	00:21:50	00:21:54	Those photos were on a flash drive that Pete hid in some dirty clothes.
388	00:21:54	00:21:56	But you didn't think to look there.
389	00:21:56	00:21:58	And they came from your phone.
390	00:21:58	00:21:59	Which Pete hacked into. Son of a bitch.
391	00:21:59	00:22:03	I guess you didn't take that same purity pledge as your girlfriend.
392	00:22:03	00:22:05	That isn't sex.
393	00:22:05	00:22:07	Oh, I don't think your girlfriend would agree.
394	00:22:07	00:22:09	Does she know you're gay? I'm not gay.
395	00:22:09	00:22:17	Gay, straight, your business, or at least it was your business right up until Pete decided to make it everyone else's.
396	00:22:17	00:22:18	And then you threw him off the bridge.
397	00:22:18	00:22:20	I didn't touch him.
398	00:22:20	00:22:23	When I saw him last night at the Theta house, somebody already worked him over pretty good.
399	00:22:23	00:22:26	Well, then, you won't mind giving us your prints and some DNA?
400	00:22:26	00:22:28	I have rights.
401	00:22:28	00:22:30	Yeah, you got rights, but you're a suspect in a murder case.
402	00:22:30	00:22:32	And we don't have a lot of time, so tell us what happened.
403	00:22:37	00:22:41	Sebastian texted me after Pete was dead.
404	00:22:41	00:22:43	He said...
405	00:22:43	00:22:45	Pete might have some photos of us.
406	00:22:45	00:22:48	Sebastian already had his phone, so I went for his computer.
407	00:22:48	00:22:51	I just didn't want them getting online.
408	00:22:51	00:23:02	Well, then, give us what we need, you know, help us rule you out as a suspect, and if you do, I promise that these photos will get buried in the evidence vault.
409	00:23:02	00:23:03	We can do that, can't we?
410	00:23:03	00:23:04	Yeah, sure.
411	00:23:09	00:23:11	Okay.
412	00:23:11	00:23:12	Ah. Yeah, there you go.
413	00:23:18	00:23:19	Thank you.
414	00:23:19	00:23:24	Why does a gossip hound need military-grade encryption for his computer files?
415	00:23:24	00:23:27	Well, certainly not 'cause he respected anyone's privacy.
416	00:23:27	00:23:31	Probably just didn't want to get scooped himself.
417	00:23:31	00:23:33	So, how long till you can unscramble it?
418	00:23:33	00:23:36	This is complicated. I'm gonna need some time.
419	00:23:36	00:23:41	When I said Pete was taking his paparazzi work seriously, I didn't realize he went full-tilt P.I.
420	00:23:41	00:23:44	Must have dropped a mint at some spy store.
421	00:23:44	00:23:45	What is that?
422	00:23:45	00:23:49	A remote digital receiver.
423	00:23:49	00:23:52	Oh, that's top of the line.
424	00:23:52	00:23:53	(beeps) Ah.
425	00:23:53	00:23:56	Still receiving a signal.
426	00:23:57	00:23:59	That's a live feed from a camera...
427	00:24:00	00:24:03	...mounted Maybe an office?
428	00:24:03	00:24:07	This picture's fuzzy 'cause we're at the edge of the camera's broadcast range.
429	00:24:07	00:24:09	Pete Moyer's entire world is WLVU.
430	00:24:09	00:24:12	I guarantee you this room is somewhere on campus.
431	00:24:12	00:24:14	Can you get me a better picture at all?
432	00:24:14	00:24:17	No. You guys should just start walking this thing back towards campus.
433	00:24:20	00:24:27	Or I could try and do my job, amplify the reception range and get a cleaner image.
434	00:24:27	00:24:28	That's a good idea.
435	00:24:28	00:24:29	Second.
436	00:24:29	00:24:30	Yeah.
437	00:24:33	00:24:35	Hey.
438	00:24:35	00:24:38	Mom insisted. She's worried you're not taking care of yourself.
439	00:24:38	00:24:40	Come on in.
440	00:24:41	00:24:43	Case must be going well.
441	00:24:43	00:24:45	Hear you have a suspect in custody.
442	00:24:47	00:24:48	You're trending.
443	00:24:48	00:24:50	I'll be darned.
444	00:24:50	00:24:53	So, it's like the court of public opinion in the digital age, right?
445	00:24:53	00:24:55	Yeah.
446	00:24:55	00:24:58	Oh. What... What do you... what you got there?
447	00:24:58	00:25:01	Are those salt and vinegar chips? Mm-hmm.
448	00:25:01	00:25:04	(chuckles) Oh, yeah.
449	00:25:05	00:25:07	It's nice to see Finn.
450	00:25:07	00:25:08	Yeah.
451	00:25:08	00:25:10	How's that working for you?
452	00:25:10	00:25:13	It's fine.
453	00:25:13	00:25:15	Why do you ask?
454	00:25:15	00:25:17	Just kind of a drag last time.
455	00:25:19	00:25:21	Well, second time's a charm.
456	00:25:21	00:25:23	Yeah, hope so.
457	00:25:23	00:25:25	Mom's not the only one who worries.
458	00:25:29	00:25:31	Ugh...
459	00:25:31	00:25:33	Finn?
460	00:25:33	00:25:35	Morgan, did you bring lunch?
461	00:25:35	00:25:36	We have company.
462	00:25:37	00:25:39	Hi.
463	00:25:39	00:25:40	Oh, hi.
464	00:25:41	00:25:43	Um, have a seat.
465	00:25:45	00:25:46	Thank you.
466	00:25:46	00:25:50	I didn't want to be seen walking into the police department, so, I thought I could talk to you guys instead?
467	00:25:50	00:25:52	Sure. Of course you can.
468	00:25:52	00:25:57	I know Jake's been arrested, but he had nothing to do with Pete's death.
469	00:25:57	00:26:00	Really? And why are you so sure about that?
470	00:26:00	00:26:02	Because I was with him... all night.
471	00:26:04	00:26:05	All night?
472	00:26:05	00:26:09	Yeah, at the party and at the bridge with everyone else, after you guys found Pete.
473	00:26:11	00:26:14	You don't have to have sex to spend the night with someone.
474	00:26:14	00:26:21	No. No, you don't, and I'm sure it's easier to keep your pledge of purity when your boyfriend's not that into you.
475	00:26:21	00:26:23	Look, I'm not naive.
476	00:26:23	00:26:26	When I met Jake, I really liked him.
477	00:26:26	00:26:28	You know, he was the perfect boyfriend for me.
478	00:26:28	00:26:36	Sexually confused enough that he would never pressure me to break my vow, which, believe it or not, is very important to me.
479	00:26:36	00:26:44	Uh, Brooke, we have evidence that Pete knew about Jake's sexual confusion, and may have been planning to out him.
480	00:26:44	00:26:47	Is that why you and Pete were fighting at the party?
481	00:26:47	00:26:49	We weren't fighting at the party.
482	00:26:49	00:26:51	No, it had nothing to do with Jake.
483	00:26:51	00:26:53	Pete was venting about Professor Laudner.
484	00:26:53	00:26:54	Professor Laudner?
485	00:26:54	00:26:56	Why? Because Laudner's a douche.
486	00:26:56	00:26:59	And Pete idolized him, wanted to be just like him.
487	00:26:59	00:27:04	I don't know what went down between those two, but Pete told me I was right all along.
488	00:27:04	00:27:07	Did he mention a physical altercation that took place with Professor Laudner?
489	00:27:07	00:27:12	I asked him why his face was all messed up, and he told me to check his next VLOG.
490	00:27:12	00:27:15	That the truth would be revealed.
491	00:27:19	00:27:20	Hey, Greg.
492	00:27:20	00:27:25	I tried boosting the reception from Pete's camera, but, uh, the image didn't get much better.
493	00:27:25	00:27:28	So, I enhanced this one area here.
494	00:27:28	00:27:30	Looks like a poster.
495	00:27:30	00:27:33	Yeah, for Celebrities Indisposed.
496	00:27:33	00:27:37	Pete's camera is in Tom Laudner's office.
497	00:27:47	00:27:48	There's the poster.
498	00:27:48	00:27:51	Camera's got to be somewhere over there.
499	00:27:51	00:27:52	Yeah.
500	00:27:57	00:28:00	Bookcase is a good place to hide a camera.
501	00:28:08	00:28:11	Think I got something on the top shelf.
502	00:28:11	00:28:12	Here it is.
503	00:28:17	00:28:20	And that's what it's looking at.
504	00:28:25	00:28:33	Yeah, well, there's only one reason why Pete Moyer would want a bird's-eye view of Professor Laudner's couch.
505	00:28:38	00:28:40	Ah, Professor.
506	00:28:40	00:28:41	Thanks for coming down.
507	00:28:41	00:28:44	Didn't seem like I had a choice.
508	00:28:44	00:28:46	You didn't.
509	00:28:46	00:28:48	Sit down, please.
510	00:28:48	00:28:50	I have something that I want to show you.
511	00:28:50	00:28:51	Really?
512	00:28:55	00:28:58	That's my office.
513	00:28:58	00:29:01	Do you have a warrant? Actually, that's university property.
514	00:29:01	00:29:03	And yeah, they've been served.
515	00:29:03	00:29:06	But you don't have probable cause for any wiretapping or surveillance.
516	00:29:06	00:29:08	That's true, that's true, we don't.
517	00:29:08	00:29:12	You see, Pete Moyer put that camera in your office.
518	00:29:12	00:29:13	He's the one who's been watching you.
519	00:29:27	00:29:29	Got a blood drop.
520	00:29:32	00:29:34	Yep. Somebody cleaned up this rug.
521	00:29:48	00:29:53	If that's Pete Moyer's blood, then he was beaten in this room.
522	00:29:58	00:30:04	So, Pete was in your office last night, and the two of you got into a fight.
523	00:30:04	00:30:08	Yeah. That's none of your business. You're pulling the privacy card. Wow.
524	00:30:08	00:30:12	After you made a career out of exposing everyone else's business.
525	00:30:12	00:30:15	That's a little hypocritical, don't you think?
526	00:30:15	00:30:16	Guilty.
527	00:30:16	00:30:18	Do you have anything else?
528	00:30:18	00:30:20	Yeah, actually I do. Thank you.
529	00:30:20	00:30:24	I have blood... on your rug.
530	00:30:24	00:30:27	See, you tried to clean it up, which makes it my business.
531	00:30:34	00:30:35	Oh, this thing had quite a workout.
532	00:30:35	00:30:40	Yeah. Maybe one of Laudner's students was riding the extra credit couch.
533	00:30:43	00:30:47	Your office hours must be very stimulating.
534	00:30:47	00:30:49	I'm sorry. Did I miss the question?
535	00:30:49	00:30:54	How many women are enrolled in your Anthropology of Fame class?
536	00:30:54	00:30:55	Thirty-eight.
537	00:30:55	00:30:58	And how many have you had sex with?
538	00:30:58	00:31:05	Okay, here's what I think happened. I think Pete Moyer found out, confirmed it with his camera, and then threatened to expose you.
539	00:31:05	00:31:08	Mr. Russell, even gossip is woven with a thread of truth.
540	00:31:08	00:31:14	Then I think that you tried to rough him up a little bit, but when that didn't work, I think you lured him out to Finals Bridge.
541	00:31:14	00:31:15	What, and pushed him off?
542	00:31:15	00:31:17	You thought it would look like a suicide.
543	00:31:17	00:31:20	Your protégé caught you with your pants down, Professor.
544	00:31:20	00:31:22	You panicked, you thought that the scandal would ruin you.
545	00:31:22	00:31:24	Are you serious?
546	00:31:24	00:31:32	Teacher sleeps with students, none of them underage, not the same sex, and all of them consensual.
547	00:31:32	00:31:33	What scandal?
548	00:31:38	00:31:39	Hey, Nick?
549	00:31:39	00:31:42	Come here for a second, will you?
550	00:31:42	00:31:43	Yeah.
551	00:31:43	00:31:47	I hate it when a suspect blows a hole in a perfectly good theory.
552	00:31:47	00:31:49	Professor Laudner.
553	00:31:49	00:31:56	Okay, okay, now, so what if Pete Moyer recorded the professor having sex-- consensual sex-- with a student?
554	00:31:56	00:31:58	Seven different students.
555	00:31:58	00:32:05	Whoa. According to the vaginal contributions on the couch, he was a busy man. But that just makes him the guy who can. It doesn't make him a killer.
556	00:32:05	00:32:14	And like he said in his dumb lectures, sex scandal nowadays just means that you got yourself a book tour, a reality show, and a movie deal, for crying out loud.
557	00:32:14	00:32:16	You're not really letting this guy get to you, are you?
558	00:32:16	00:32:18	That's beside the point.
559	00:32:18	00:32:21	What I don't see is a motive for killing Pete.
560	00:32:21	00:32:22	We know he punched him.
561	00:32:22	00:32:25	We confirmed it was Pete's blood in Laudner's office.
562	00:32:25	00:32:26	Okay, but if...
563	00:32:26	00:32:29	if the fight wasn't about a sex scandal, then what was it?
564	00:32:31	00:32:34	You never know what you're gonna see when you turn a camera on.
565	00:32:34	00:32:35	Or what people are gonna do.
566	00:32:35	00:32:38	Maybe Pete saw something more than sex.
567	00:32:38	00:32:43	Maybe Pete saw something Laudner didn't want him to.
568	00:32:43	00:32:46	I wouldn't put it past Laudner to take advantage of his students, would you?
569	00:32:46	00:32:49	And maybe not take no for an answer.
570	00:32:49	00:32:50	Maybe.
571	00:32:50	00:32:52	I like that.
572	00:32:52	00:32:56	Okay, we need to identify these seven women.
573	00:33:06	00:33:08	You see the cops take him away?
574	00:33:08	00:33:11	Yeah. So it's got to be true, right?
575	00:33:11	00:33:14	Professor Laudner's been arrested?
576	00:33:14	00:33:16	Good afternoon, class.
577	00:33:16	00:33:20	My name is Julie Finlay, and this is Morgan Brody.
578	00:33:20	00:33:22	We work with the Crime Lab.
579	00:33:22	00:33:27	We are here investigating the death of Pete Moyer.
580	00:33:27	00:33:30	We are going to share details with you regarding our homicide investigation.
581	00:33:30	00:33:34	Now, this information has been withheld from the public.
582	00:33:34	00:33:43	We discovered epithelials, skin cell DNA, under the victim's fingernails, which tells us that he struggled with his killer in the moments before his death.
583	00:33:43	00:33:51	The way this works, we start by trying to exclude Pete's classmates and friends, in order to zero in on our killer.
584	00:33:51	00:33:56	Now, in order to do that, we need to collect DNA samples from all of you.
585	00:33:56	00:33:58	What if we refuse?
586	00:33:59	00:34:10	Well, you do have that legal right-- this is strictly voluntary-- but I would like to ask you all to refrain from spreading false rumors about any classmates who refuse to cooperate.
587	00:34:10	00:34:14	So no sharing, no posting, no kidding.
588	00:34:18	00:34:20	First volunteers get the clean swabs.
589	00:34:26	00:34:28	I can't believe that just worked. Mm-hmm.
590	00:34:33	00:34:35	Hey, Nick.
591	00:34:35	00:34:39	I identified the seven vaginal contributors from the couch in Professor Laudner's office.
592	00:34:39	00:34:41	All these girls were in his class.
593	00:34:43	00:34:45	All right, I'll have Brass bring them in.
594	00:34:47	00:34:51	Well, Professor Laudner's office hours are open to every student in the class, so...
595	00:34:51	00:34:54	are you asking me if I had sex with Professor Laudner?
596	00:34:54	00:34:57	I'm asking you if it was consensual.
597	00:34:57	00:34:59	I took Laudner's class for an easy A.
598	00:34:59	00:35:05	Everybody knows that if you're a pretty girl, wear a short skirt and sit in the front row, you get an A.
599	00:35:05	00:35:08	Did he promise if you slept with him he'd give you an A?
600	00:35:08	00:35:11	He never made any promises, but...
601	00:35:11	00:35:13	it was understood.
602	00:35:13	00:35:19	Ashley, we've collected forensic evidence, and we're talking to other girls.
603	00:35:19	00:35:23	We know that Professor Laudner offered sex for grades.
604	00:35:26	00:35:30	I am not accusing you of anything.
605	00:35:30	00:35:35	I just would like to ask if you had consensual sex with Professor Laudner.
606	00:35:39	00:35:41	Did Professor Laudner hurt you?
607	00:35:41	00:35:42	I don't want to talk about it.
608	00:35:45	00:35:48	Ashley, I know you want to help us find Pete's killer.
609	00:35:50	00:35:55	I think Pete found out about what happened to you, and then he tried to help you.
610	00:35:55	00:35:57	Pete did not want to help me.
611	00:35:57	00:36:00	Pete only cared about Pete and his damn gossip!
612	00:36:02	00:36:05	I didn't want to talk to Pete, and I don't want to talk to you.
613	00:36:05	00:36:09	I have a right to be left alone. Ashley, I understand that...
614	00:36:09	00:36:17	but what Pete found out cost him his life, so I need you to help me find out what happened to him, and I need you to let me help you.
615	00:36:17	00:36:19	You can't help me!
616	00:36:19	00:36:20	No one can!
617	00:36:20	00:36:22	I would like to try.
618	00:36:22	00:36:23	I killed Pete!
619	00:36:23	00:36:26	Okay? I was the reason he was at that bridge!
620	00:36:26	00:36:28	I pushed him off!
621	00:36:30	00:36:32	Can you help me now?
622	00:36:36	00:36:39	Get off me! Please!
623	00:36:39	00:36:42	Finally decrypted Pete's hard drive.
624	00:36:42	00:36:44	Been through all the videos.
625	00:36:44	00:36:45	A lot of sex, but...
626	00:36:45	00:36:47	nothing like this.
627	00:36:49	00:36:50	That is so clearly rape.
628	00:36:50	00:36:52	Why wouldn't Ashley have reported it?
629	00:36:52	00:36:55	A lot of shame associated with sexual assault.
630	00:36:55	00:36:58	Especially if the rapist is known to the victim.
631	00:36:58	00:37:05	So, Mandy matched three unknown sets of prints from the bridge to the ten-card that Finlay collected from Ashley Benson.
632	00:37:05	00:37:08	So she was there? Yeah.
633	00:37:08	00:37:11	The problem is, there's an inconsistency with her confession.
634	00:37:11	00:37:13	Mind if I get in there?
635	00:37:13	00:37:14	So...
636	00:37:14	00:37:17	all of her prints are on...
637	00:37:17	00:37:18	this lamppost.
638	00:37:18	00:37:21	The first set is at approximately five feet.
639	00:37:21	00:37:24	The highest is a little over eight.
640	00:37:24	00:37:26	Well, Ashley's about my height, so...
641	00:37:28	00:37:30	Here's your first set of prints.
642	00:37:30	00:37:35	Okay. Add what, 18 inches for the bench?
643	00:37:49	00:37:51	There's your second set of prints.
644	00:37:51	00:37:54	Well, another 18 inches, and you're at eight feet.
645	00:37:54	00:37:58	Looks like you might need a little help to get there.
646	00:38:06	00:38:07	Ashley was climbing.
647	00:38:07	00:38:10	Yep. Right onto the ledge.
648	00:38:18	00:38:22	Pete followed me to the bridge...
649	00:38:22	00:38:25	ambushed me as I was leaving the party.
650	00:38:25	00:38:30	He said he knew what Laudner had done to me and he'd seen it with his own eyes. So he...
651	00:38:30	00:38:38	told you about the tape? Yeah, he said he was gonna post it on his Web site and that he wanted my exclusive.
652	00:38:38	00:38:39	I knew the rumors.
653	00:38:39	00:38:43	I knew that some of the girls were sleeping with him.
654	00:38:44	00:38:46	But I'm not like that.
655	00:38:48	00:38:50	I should have taken the C.
656	00:38:50	00:38:55	I was trying so hard to get into business school, and...
657	00:38:55	00:38:58	Ashley, you did nothing wrong; nothing.
658	00:38:58	00:39:00	Have you seen it?
659	00:39:01	00:39:04	The tape is evidence.
660	00:39:04	00:39:07	So it's gonna be everywhere.
661	00:39:09	00:39:11	I need you to tell me what happened.
662	00:39:11	00:39:15	I... I thought Pete was there because he actually cared about me.
663	00:39:20	00:39:22	Look, forget my VLOG.
664	00:39:22	00:39:24	I'll go with you to the cops; we'll talk to them together.
665	00:39:24	00:39:27	It doesn't matter! He raped me!
666	00:39:27	00:39:28	You don't have to do this.
667	00:39:28	00:39:33	He said we couldn't give up, and that I couldn't let Laudner win.
668	00:39:33	00:39:35	I want it to be over!
669	00:39:35	00:39:36	Come here.
670	00:39:36	00:39:39	Take my hand.
671	00:39:39	00:39:40	Hey, you have to trust me.
672	00:39:42	00:39:47	And then I turned around, and he had his phone out.
673	00:39:47	00:39:52	He was recording us, or-or texting, or tweeting, I don't know, but...
674	00:39:52	00:39:55	I knocked it out of his hand.
675	00:40:05	00:40:14	If I just hadn't gone into Laudner's office, Pete would still be alive! Ashley, from what you're telling me, it was an accident.
676	00:40:14	00:40:15	It was not your fault.
677	00:40:15	00:40:18	Okay? None of this is your fault.
678	00:40:18	00:40:22	Not Pete's death, and certainly not what Laudner did to you.
679	00:40:22	00:40:26	I lived with it for 13 days.
680	00:40:26	00:40:27	I went to class.
681	00:40:27	00:40:31	I worked at my job.
682	00:40:31	00:40:32	I talked to my parents.
683	00:40:32	00:40:34	I just...
684	00:40:34	00:40:38	I boxed it up, and I put it on a shelf.
685	00:40:40	00:40:47	I am gonna have experts testify to your behavior, so that when you take the stand, the jury will know why you went back to that class.
686	00:40:47	00:40:49	A jury?
687	00:40:49	00:40:52	I-I can't stand in front of a jury.
688	00:40:52	00:40:55	There is no hope of stopping Laudner if you don't.
689	00:40:55	00:40:57	That's not my problem.
690	00:40:58	00:41:02	I just want to be left alone.
691	00:41:02	00:41:04	Please.
692	00:41:17	00:41:18	You know I talked to the D.A.
693	00:41:18	00:41:20	She's not gonna file on just the tape.
694	00:41:20	00:41:25	Which means the guy walks. Yeah, and the bastard's gonna go do it again to another girl.
695	00:41:25	00:41:26	We have to take our victims as they come.
696	00:41:35	00:41:36	Hey, Dad.
697	00:41:36	00:41:37	Oh. Hey.
698	00:41:37	00:41:39	You look terrible.
699	00:41:39	00:41:41	Oh, thanks a lot.
700	00:41:41	00:41:42	Were we supposed to be doing something?
701	00:41:42	00:41:46	No, but Mom thought it would be cool if we all met up for dinner.
702	00:41:46	00:41:49	Oh, that sounds fun.
703	00:41:49	00:41:53	Something wrong? Well, some cases don't end up the way you want them to.
704	00:41:53	00:41:56	Yeah, but this one did, right?
705	00:41:56	00:41:57	No.
706	00:41:57	00:41:59	Really? Check it out.
707	00:41:59	00:42:02	It's all over the Internet-- Professor Laudner raped a student.
708	00:42:02	00:42:05	Ah. News travels fast, doesn't it?
709	00:42:05	00:42:08	The university suspended him.
710	00:42:08	00:42:09	What?
711	00:42:09	00:42:11	I mean, look at all these posts.
712	00:42:11	00:42:13	It's not like he's gonna get away with it.
713	00:42:16	00:42:17	Yeah.
714	00:42:17	00:42:19	So...
715	00:42:19	00:42:21	this is what you call trending, right?
716	00:42:21	00:42:24	Mm-hmm.
717	00:42:26	00:42:28	Let's go meet your mother.
