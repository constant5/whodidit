1,00:00:28,00:00:30,"Yo, Gossip Girl! Slow down!"
2,00:00:30,00:00:33,"Who'd you piss off now? Not now, Jake."
3,00:00:33,00:00:36,"Well, if you're looking for our girlfriend, okay, you just missed her."
4,00:00:37,00:00:39,"(cheering, whooping)"
5,00:00:48,00:00:49,Aren't you Brooke Cassidy?
6,00:00:49,00:00:51,That's me.
7,00:00:52,00:00:53,"So, you really a virgin?"
8,00:00:57,00:00:59,You forgot your number.
9,00:00:59,00:01:00,I could be your first time!
10,00:01:21,00:01:25,Yeah! Whoo! Yeah!
11,00:01:25,00:01:26,(yells)
12,00:01:26,00:01:29,"Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink!"
13,00:01:29,00:01:30,How did I let you get me into this?
14,00:01:30,00:01:31,"Come on! Drink, drink!"
15,00:01:31,00:01:35,"Ladies, got a room upstairs."
16,00:01:35,00:01:37,Get off of me!
17,00:01:41,00:01:42,Babe.
18,00:01:44,00:01:46,"Uh, you find your little, uh, BFF?"
19,00:01:46,00:01:47,"Oh, let it go."
20,00:01:47,00:01:49,"I'm sorry, I meant GBF."
21,00:01:49,00:01:51,Gay Best Friend. (chuckles)
22,00:01:56,00:01:58,Stop! (grunts)
23,00:01:58,00:02:00,"I'm sorry, I left my purity ring in my room."
24,00:02:00,00:02:01,You want to come help me look for it?
25,00:02:04,00:02:05,Bye.
26,00:02:18,00:02:20,We're trending!
27,00:02:20,00:02:22,(cheering)
28,00:03:03,00:03:08,"BRASS: So, a series of 911 calls came in just after 4:00 a.m."
29,00:03:08,00:03:09,Dead body.
30,00:03:09,00:03:11,An anonymous tip gave us the location.
31,00:03:11,00:03:14,"Who invited the campus? I know, they keep coming."
32,00:03:14,00:03:15,It's like moths to a flame.
33,00:03:15,00:03:17,"Anyway, this place is notorious."
34,00:03:17,00:03:19,It's called Finals Bridge.
35,00:03:19,00:03:21,32 feet down to a broken neck.
36,00:03:21,00:03:29,"So a big suicide spot? Well, used to be till the university closed it down five years ago. Anyway, I got to get back to take statements from the first responders."
37,00:03:31,00:03:33,"Hey, what do you got?"
38,00:03:33,00:03:35,"Well, I got a beer bottle."
39,00:03:35,00:03:37,"Well, that's something. Mm-hmm."
40,00:03:37,00:03:39,"RUSSELL: Still wet, so it's recent."
41,00:03:39,00:03:44,"Yeah, and I got some sediment disturbances here on the ground."
42,00:03:44,00:03:46,And then up here...
43,00:03:46,00:03:48,base of the lamppost.
44,00:03:48,00:03:51,Two different sets of shoe prints here.
45,00:03:51,00:03:54,"They're not distinct, but it looks to me like there might have been a struggle?"
46,00:03:54,00:03:56,"Yeah. Well, there's more..."
47,00:03:56,00:04:00,here... on the ledge.
48,00:04:01,00:04:03,Doesn't look like he jumped.
49,00:04:05,00:04:08,Maybe someone pushed this kid over the edge.
50,00:04:48,00:04:50,All right.
51,00:04:53,00:04:55,Ow.
52,00:04:55,00:04:57,You okay? Yeah.
53,00:04:57,00:05:00,Nothing that a chiropractor can't fix.
54,00:05:01,00:05:04,Five call-outs today.
55,00:05:04,00:05:07,Not one died some place where I'm not risking my life.
56,00:05:07,00:05:10,"Yeah, well it sounds like it's been a rough night for everybody, especially this guy."
57,00:05:10,00:05:13,And you can smell it. He's had more than just a couple of beers.
58,00:05:13,00:05:16,Long night of partying. Things got out of hand.
59,00:05:16,00:05:20,Student looky-loos say they last saw him at the Theta Delta party.
60,00:05:22,00:05:25,"STOKES: Student I.D. says Pete Moyer, sophomore."
61,00:05:25,00:05:27,"Has he got a cell phone on him, Super Dave?"
62,00:05:27,00:05:30,"No, not on him."
63,00:05:30,00:05:33,"College kid without a cell phone, that doesn't happen."
64,00:05:33,00:05:35,Antemortem bruising on the face.
65,00:05:35,00:05:37,"Yeah, from a fight maybe."
66,00:05:39,00:05:40,Skull's crushed.
67,00:05:40,00:05:42,It's consistent with the fall.
68,00:05:42,00:05:43,"BRODY: Yeah, he didn't drop straight down."
69,00:05:43,00:05:48,"Trajectory says, he had some momentum when he came off the bridge."
70,00:05:48,00:05:51,(yelling)
71,00:05:51,00:05:54,Suggests a push.
72,00:05:54,00:05:57,Maybe it was from the same person that messed up his face.
73,00:06:07,00:06:11,"What are you doing, taking candids of our crowd?"
74,00:06:11,00:06:14,You never know if the suspect might return to the scene.
75,00:06:14,00:06:15,Out of feelings of guilt?
76,00:06:15,00:06:17,Maybe they want to enjoy the show.
77,00:06:21,00:06:24,"Ah, person of interest."
78,00:06:24,00:06:25,"Oh, yeah. (chuckles)"
79,00:06:27,00:06:28,Charlie.
80,00:06:28,00:06:30,Giving the girls trouble?
81,00:06:30,00:06:33,"Between school and basketball, I don't really have much time."
82,00:06:33,00:06:34,"It's good to see you, Finn."
83,00:06:34,00:06:35,It's really good to see you.
84,00:06:35,00:06:37,And Dad said you two were working together again.
85,00:06:37,00:06:39,"Yes, we are."
86,00:06:39,00:06:40,So when are we going to play tennis?
87,00:06:40,00:06:42,Think you can finally beat me?
88,00:06:42,00:06:44,"Ah, yeah, good luck with that, buddy."
89,00:06:44,00:06:45,How come you're not in class?
90,00:06:45,00:06:47,"Dad, it's 7:00 a.m."
91,00:06:47,00:06:50,"Besides, everybody's talking about this. Yeah. I noticed that."
92,00:06:50,00:06:51,How'd they get here so quickly?
93,00:06:51,00:06:54,"Um, it's trending."
94,00:06:54,00:06:56,What? Can I see that?
95,00:06:56,00:06:58,Posted at 3:57 a.m.
96,00:06:58,00:07:00,User name Voyeur4U.
97,00:07:00,00:07:01,3:57.
98,00:07:01,00:07:05,Brass said the 911 started coming in after 4:00.
99,00:07:05,00:07:09,That means this Voyuer4U guy knew about the body before the cops or anybody else.
100,00:07:09,00:07:10,So this guy could be our killer.
101,00:07:10,00:07:12,The dude wanted to post and boast.
102,00:07:14,00:07:15,Just saying.
103,00:07:15,00:07:17,That is a good theory.
104,00:07:19,00:07:21,Must run in the blood.
105,00:07:24,00:07:26,"What can you tell me, Doc?"
106,00:07:26,00:07:30,"Well, our young man's skull fracture was accompanied by a fracture to the C1 vertebra."
107,00:07:30,00:07:32,Severed the spinal cord.
108,00:07:32,00:07:35,Injuries were debilitating and fatal.
109,00:07:35,00:07:36,What about the antemortem injuries?
110,00:07:36,00:07:43,"Well, besides the split lip and contusions, he suffered a fracture to the zygomatic arch."
111,00:07:43,00:07:45,Also the nasal cartilage.
112,00:07:45,00:07:47,"And there was blood in the nares, the nostrils."
113,00:07:47,00:07:49,He really took a beating.
114,00:07:49,00:07:51,Contusions take around six hours to set.
115,00:07:51,00:07:54,"He was killed around 4:00 a.m., means he was assaulted around 10:00 p.m."
116,00:07:54,00:07:56,And there were no defensive wounds.
117,00:08:02,00:08:03,The fight was one-sided.
118,00:08:06,00:08:08,Somebody really had it in for this kid.
119,00:08:12,00:08:17,"All right, so, the autopsy says that Pete Moyer got himself beaten up at about 10:00 p.m."
120,00:08:17,00:08:22,"We didn't find any blood on his clothes from a fight but, Nick and Greg did find bloody clothes in his dorm room."
121,00:08:22,00:08:26,"And apart from the clothes, the room was completely empty."
122,00:08:26,00:08:27,What do you mean?
123,00:08:27,00:08:31,"Apparently, a bunch of students went in there and helped themselves to his stuff."
124,00:08:31,00:08:32,You're kidding me. Yeah.
125,00:08:32,00:08:34,Isn't that disgusting?
126,00:08:34,00:08:42,"So, Pete, last night, gets into a fight, goes back to his dorm room, changes his clothes and then he goes the Theta Delta party."
127,00:08:42,00:08:48,"Yeah, where, maybe, he runs into the guy that he had the fight with, and then the fight continues, and ends on the bridge."
128,00:08:48,00:08:50,"Okay, so..."
129,00:08:50,00:08:52,sounds like we need to know more about this party.
130,00:08:52,00:08:57,"Oh, yeah, what about this Voyuer4U guy who posted the photo?"
131,00:08:57,00:08:59,"Yeah, Archie's working on it right now."
132,00:08:59,00:09:02,"Yeah, please, make yourself a home."
133,00:09:02,00:09:04,Thank you. I can't believe...
134,00:09:06,00:09:08,"Hey, Archie."
135,00:09:08,00:09:11,What do you got? Running an ISP trace on Voyeur4U.
136,00:09:11,00:09:13,Still waiting. Are these from the Theta party?
137,00:09:13,00:09:16,Yeah. Going through all the posted photos looking for Pete.
138,00:09:16,00:09:21,"No luck yet, but, uh, still got another 1,367 photos to go."
139,00:09:21,00:09:22,"Oh, great. What do you have?"
140,00:09:22,00:09:25,Pete Moyer's FriendAgenda page.
141,00:09:25,00:09:34,"This guy lived out loud in more ways than one-- openly gay, and he didn't pull any punches when it came to his feelings about others. What do you mean?"
142,00:09:34,00:09:36,He kept a VLOG. Video blog.
143,00:09:36,00:09:39,Kind of like a campus version of Perez Hilton.
144,00:09:39,00:09:42,Pete posted juicy gossip about everybody on campus.
145,00:09:42,00:09:48,"Everything from who's sleeping with whom, to whose spring break was more like spring rehab."
146,00:09:48,00:09:51,"Okay, so sounds like this guy made a lot of enemies, right?"
147,00:09:51,00:09:56,"Oh, yeah, one in particular-- username Jonesin4."
148,00:09:56,00:09:58,Comments are full of homophobic slurs.
149,00:09:58,00:09:59,Some of 'em are kind of violent.
150,00:09:59,00:10:02,"Like this one, posted last night."
151,00:10:02,00:10:04,"""Hey, Queer."
152,00:10:04,00:10:06,"""Stop gossiping and meet up with me, if you're man enough."
153,00:10:06,00:10:10,"Or I'll find you."" Maybe this is a hate crime."
154,00:10:10,00:10:11,"Hey, guys."
155,00:10:11,00:10:12,We got a hit on Voyeur4U.
156,00:10:12,00:10:13,Who is it?
157,00:10:15,00:10:16,Pete Moyer's account.
158,00:10:16,00:10:19,His death shot was posted from his own phone.
159,00:10:19,00:10:21,We didn't find his cell phone at the scene.
160,00:10:21,00:10:23,"Maybe the killer picked it up, you know."
161,00:10:23,00:10:24,He might still have it.
162,00:10:24,00:10:25,Track the cell's GPS.
163,00:10:25,00:10:27,Already on it.
164,00:10:27,00:10:29,"JOHNSON: WLVU campus, Vincer Hall."
165,00:10:29,00:10:31,That dorm has five floors.
166,00:10:31,00:10:33,And I can track the current altitude of that cell phone.
167,00:10:33,00:10:34,You're kidding me.
168,00:10:34,00:10:37,"2,061 feet above sea level."
169,00:10:37,00:10:39,"So, in Vegas, that's about 27 feet above ground."
170,00:10:39,00:10:41,"I'd say that's the third floor. Hey, Nick."
171,00:10:41,00:10:43,"Are you and Greg still on campus? STOKES: Yes, sir."
172,00:10:43,00:10:45,"Yeah, we have a location on Pete Moyer's phone."
173,00:10:48,00:10:50,Room's clear.
174,00:10:50,00:10:52,Next one.
175,00:10:52,00:10:54,LVPD!
176,00:10:54,00:10:56,Open up! (window opening)
177,00:10:56,00:10:58,"Get in there, Vaughn."
178,00:10:59,00:11:01,Don't leave out that window!
179,00:11:01,00:11:04,Get your hands off me!
180,00:11:04,00:11:05,"Why you running, dude?"
181,00:11:05,00:11:07,Resisting arrest-- not cool.
182,00:11:07,00:11:09,That must be Jonesin4.
183,00:11:09,00:11:11,(chuckles)
184,00:11:11,00:11:13,I think I know for what.
185,00:11:13,00:11:17,"Whatever you're jonesing for, this guy's got it."
186,00:11:17,00:11:19,"Hey, try the number."
187,00:11:22,00:11:23,(line ringing)
188,00:11:23,00:11:25,(phone chiming)
189,00:11:31,00:11:32,(sighs)
190,00:11:32,00:11:33,Pete's phone.
191,00:11:33,00:11:35,So you think this guy's Pete's killer?
192,00:11:35,00:11:37,I think we have a strong connection.
193,00:11:42,00:11:44,You guys got this so wrong.
194,00:11:47,00:11:53,"""Hey, Queer. Stop gossiping and meet up with me if you're man enough. Or I'll find you."" Now, it sounds to me like we've got it right."
195,00:11:53,00:11:55,You had it in for Pete.
196,00:11:55,00:11:57,So is that your thing-- you like to gay-bash?
197,00:11:57,00:12:01,The last person who'd bash Pete for being gay is me. Really?
198,00:12:01,00:12:02,Why is that?
199,00:12:02,00:12:05,Because I'm gay.
200,00:12:05,00:12:09,"""Hey, Queer"" and all that-- it's just the way we talk to each other."
201,00:12:09,00:12:11,"It's kind of an ""us"" versus ""you"" thing."
202,00:12:11,00:12:15,"Well, we have evidence that suggests a ""you"" versus ""Pete"" thing on the bridge last night."
203,00:12:15,00:12:19,We found a beer bottle with your DNA on it in the exact spot where somebody pushed Pete to his death.
204,00:12:19,00:12:21,"Look, I didn't kill Pete."
205,00:12:21,00:12:22,"Okay, you were on the bridge-- at least give me that much."
206,00:12:22,00:12:24,"Yes, I admit that, I was on the bridge."
207,00:12:24,00:12:27,But only because he texted me.
208,00:12:27,00:12:29,He said he needed help.
209,00:12:29,00:12:31,Someone had done a number on him.
210,00:12:31,00:12:33,(phone ringing) Figured he was in trouble.
211,00:12:35,00:12:37,"By the time I got there, he was dead."
212,00:12:37,00:12:39,"Whatever happened on that bridge, I was too late."
213,00:12:39,00:12:41,(camera clicks)
214,00:12:41,00:12:43,"Yeah, well, you're a really good friend, man."
215,00:12:43,00:12:50,"You find him dead, you take his phone, you take his picture, and you post it to the Internet? Yeah, what, did you forget to call 911? I called."
216,00:12:50,00:12:51,When I got back to my room.
217,00:12:51,00:12:53,I told you where to find his body.
218,00:12:53,00:12:56,Posting that photo is what Pete would've wanted.
219,00:12:56,00:12:58,What's that supposed to mean?
220,00:12:58,00:13:00,Trend To The End.
221,00:13:00,00:13:06,"All right, well, let's say that you were just the photographer, who do you suppose had it in for Pete?"
222,00:13:06,00:13:08,Don't know who.
223,00:13:08,00:13:09,Might know why.
224,00:13:09,00:13:14,"It's all about the ""scan-dahl."" What scandal?"
225,00:13:14,00:13:16,Pete wouldn't tell me.
226,00:13:16,00:13:19,But he had some campus dirt that he was going to dish.
227,00:13:19,00:13:21,Total TMZ.
228,00:13:23,00:13:25,"Love me, hate me."
229,00:13:25,00:13:31,But you know that I live by one rule: privacy is history.
230,00:13:31,00:13:35,"The eye in the sky sees all, shares all."
231,00:13:35,00:13:39,"Now, if you can't own it, don't do it."
232,00:13:39,00:13:48,"Now, sometimes this means making hard calls, hurting people close to you, but I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't tell all."
233,00:13:48,00:13:53,And this bomb that I'm about to drop...
234,00:13:53,00:13:57,it's gonna blow you away.
235,00:13:57,00:13:58,(mimics explosion)
236,00:13:58,00:14:00,BRODY: Got this off Pete's phone.
237,00:14:00,00:14:03,Thinking it was going to be his latest VLOG entry.
238,00:14:03,00:14:05,Or whatever his tell-all was.
239,00:14:05,00:14:08,I think I know what it could have been about.
240,00:14:08,00:14:12,"I found these pictures of Pete talking to Brooke Cassidy, the actress."
241,00:14:12,00:14:13,"Oh, more than an actress."
242,00:14:13,00:14:16,Brooke Cassidy is an industry.
243,00:14:16,00:14:19,Kids love her; parents love her even more. Yeah.
244,00:14:19,00:14:20,"No sex, no drugs."
245,00:14:20,00:14:22,America's favorite virgin.
246,00:14:22,00:14:25,Tough act to keep up in college.
247,00:14:25,00:14:27,"Yes, and maybe she didn't, and maybe Pete found out."
248,00:14:27,00:14:30,"And here he is, giving her the heads-up."
249,00:14:30,00:14:33,Before he drops the bomb.
250,00:14:38,00:14:39,"Excuse me, Ms. Cassidy."
251,00:14:39,00:14:41,We're from the Crime Lab.
252,00:14:41,00:14:43,This is CSI Brody. I'm CSI Finlay.
253,00:14:43,00:14:45,We're investigating Pete Moyer's death.
254,00:14:45,00:14:47,"It's an awful thing. Yeah. Yeah, it is."
255,00:14:47,00:14:51,"And according to Pete's VLOG, you guys were pretty good friends."
256,00:14:51,00:14:53,"Yeah, that's right."
257,00:14:53,00:14:57,"According to photos posted from the Theta party, you were one of the last people to see him."
258,00:14:57,00:14:59,I guess so.
259,00:14:59,00:15:01,What exactly can you tell us about his state of mind?
260,00:15:01,00:15:02,I don't know.
261,00:15:02,00:15:04,Pete was Pete.
262,00:15:04,00:15:05,What does that mean?
263,00:15:05,00:15:06,A hot mess.
264,00:15:06,00:15:08,Opinionated.
265,00:15:08,00:15:09,He could be cruel sometimes.
266,00:15:09,00:15:12,Was he ever cruel to you?
267,00:15:12,00:15:16,"It seems like everybody wants to get ahead, so they'll say whatever they want about me, even if it's a total lie."
268,00:15:16,00:15:20,"I came here to be a student, and I thought that Pete respected that."
269,00:15:20,00:15:25,And that would be important to a woman who had made a very public pledge of purity until marriage.
270,00:15:25,00:15:26,What are you implying?
271,00:15:26,00:15:31,We would just like to know what the two of you were talking about before someone pushed Pete off the bridge.
272,00:15:33,00:15:35,"Whatever it was, you don't look happy."
273,00:15:37,00:15:39,"Okay, I don't like where this is going."
274,00:15:39,00:15:40,I don't either.
275,00:15:40,00:15:42,And you are?
276,00:15:42,00:15:46,"Jake Pychan, Theta Delta Zeta president."
277,00:15:46,00:15:48,Are these people giving you a hard time?
278,00:15:48,00:15:50,No. They're just asking questions about Pete.
279,00:15:50,00:15:52,"Oh, I can tell you all you need to know."
280,00:15:52,00:15:53,"Oh, great."
281,00:15:53,00:15:55,Pete Moyer was a leech.
282,00:15:55,00:15:59,A nobody who tried to be a somebody by posting lies.
283,00:15:59,00:16:00,I warned Brooke about him.
284,00:16:00,00:16:02,"I can see you're very protective, Mr. President."
285,00:16:02,00:16:04,And busy.
286,00:16:04,00:16:06,I got a class to get to. So does Brooke.
287,00:16:10,00:16:12,Is that everything from Pete's room?
288,00:16:12,00:16:13,Almost.
289,00:16:13,00:16:15,Still haven't got his computer yet.
290,00:16:15,00:16:17,"Oh, look at that."
291,00:16:17,00:16:20,Nice to see some things never change.
292,00:16:20,00:16:22,Instant ramen!
293,00:16:22,00:16:24,And a Crock-Pot.
294,00:16:24,00:16:26,Good times.
295,00:16:26,00:16:28,The kid had all kinds of electronica.
296,00:16:28,00:16:30,Cameras and microphones...
297,00:16:30,00:16:32,listening devices.
298,00:16:32,00:16:35,Took this whole paparazzi thing pretty seriously.
299,00:16:36,00:16:37,Yeah.
300,00:16:37,00:16:41,"Like, A-plus seriously."
301,00:16:41,00:16:46,"Pete wrote a term paper here called ""Phone Hacking for Hacks."" It's like a how-to guide."
302,00:16:46,00:16:47,Phone hacking for credit?
303,00:16:47,00:16:49,What kind of class teaches that?
304,00:16:49,00:16:52,Anthropology of Fame.
305,00:16:52,00:16:54,Taught by Professor Tom Laudner.
306,00:16:54,00:16:55,Tom Laudner?
307,00:16:55,00:16:56,I know that guy.
308,00:16:56,00:17:01,He has a tabloid TV show called Celebrities Indisposed.
309,00:17:01,00:17:03,He earns his living harassing celebrities.
310,00:17:03,00:17:06,"And now he's teaching our kids, right?"
311,00:17:06,00:17:08,Hester...
312,00:17:08,00:17:10,Prynne.
313,00:17:10,00:17:12,The Scarlet Letter.
314,00:17:12,00:17:18,I like to think of Hester as the first bad girl gone viral.
315,00:17:18,00:17:19,But that was then.
316,00:17:19,00:17:22,This... is now.
317,00:17:22,00:17:28,"Today, the scarlet letter-- it gets you a book deal, it gets you a product line, it gets you a reality show."
318,00:17:28,00:17:31,Fame is good.
319,00:17:31,00:17:32,But...
320,00:17:32,00:17:39,"without the judgment of the church or the community, what's left to keep us in line?"
321,00:17:39,00:17:41,Hmm?
322,00:17:41,00:17:46,"Gossip, fear, ridicule, shame."
323,00:17:46,00:17:49,Gossip is good.
324,00:17:49,00:17:50,Gossip works...
325,00:17:50,00:17:53,for society.
326,00:17:59,00:18:01,Wow. That was a great lecture.
327,00:18:01,00:18:03,"Professor Laudner, right?"
328,00:18:03,00:18:05,"Mmm, yes. Well, I'm glad you could make it."
329,00:18:05,00:18:06,"Uh, the police, right?"
330,00:18:06,00:18:07,Uh... CSI.
331,00:18:07,00:18:09,D.B. Russell.
332,00:18:09,00:18:10,"Oh, nice to meet you. Yeah. You too."
333,00:18:10,00:18:13,"Yeah. I presume this is about Pete Moyer, yeah?"
334,00:18:13,00:18:16,"Yeah, yeah. He was one of your students, right?"
335,00:18:16,00:18:18,"He was my best student. Yeah, I could tell that."
336,00:18:18,00:18:20,"You know, I saw some of his course work."
337,00:18:20,00:18:22,Especially that paper on phone hacking.
338,00:18:22,00:18:24,That was a good one.
339,00:18:24,00:18:26,"Well, maybe not so good for Pete."
340,00:18:26,00:18:30,"See, I think he may have tried to hack the wrong phone."
341,00:18:30,00:18:33,"Well, I mean, I couldn't tell you anything about that."
342,00:18:33,00:18:40,"No. Well... I mean this is a classroom and, you know, we just try to create a safe environment for students to pursue their intellectual muse."
343,00:18:40,00:18:41,"Oh, I'm confused."
344,00:18:41,00:18:43,I thought you taught a class on gossip.
345,00:18:43,00:18:47,"Oh, no, no, no, no-- I teach a course on the sociology of celebrity; the culture of idolatry."
346,00:18:47,00:18:56,"I mean, college is to prepare students for the real world, right? The campus is a microcosm for society-- you got the haves, you got the have-nots, you've got the beautiful people, and the, uh..."
347,00:18:56,00:18:57,"you know, not-so-beautiful people."
348,00:18:57,00:19:01,"And you got a real world actress playing student too, right? Yeah."
349,00:19:01,00:19:03,Brooke Cassidy? Fabulous girl.
350,00:19:03,00:19:08,"Yeah, she was kind enough to serve as an object lesson in one of my lectures. That was kind of her."
351,00:19:08,00:19:12,"'Cause the way I hear it, she's, like, this scandal waiting to happen. Yeah."
352,00:19:12,00:19:13,Teen Dream deflowered.
353,00:19:13,00:19:16,It'd obviously make a good story.
354,00:19:16,00:19:18,"Hey, did you have Pete try to hack into some of that? Pete? No, no, no, no."
355,00:19:18,00:19:22,"He's one of my students, he's not one of my employees. (laughs)"
356,00:19:22,00:19:24,"Right. Right, right, right."
357,00:19:24,00:19:27,"Listen, what I can tell you about Pete..."
358,00:19:27,00:19:31,"as ""out"" as he was, he kept a few things in the closet."
359,00:19:33,00:19:35,That's as close as you'll get to an exclusive from me.
360,00:19:35,00:19:37,Okay. I hope you return the favor.
361,00:19:37,00:19:40,"Oh, hey, thank you so much. That was very helpful. No, no, no, thank you."
362,00:19:40,00:19:43,"Nice to meet you, sir. Take care. Yeah, you, too."
363,00:19:43,00:19:45,Good luck. Thanks.
364,00:19:52,00:19:54,What are we looking for exactly?
365,00:19:54,00:20:02,"Oh, you know, something besides a computer or a hard drive where Pete could've stored whatever dirt he dug up on Brooke Cassidy."
366,00:20:02,00:20:04,You sure the professor's not just messing with you?
367,00:20:04,00:20:06,He was pretty clear about the quid pro quo.
368,00:20:10,00:20:12,I think I...
369,00:20:12,00:20:14,may have just found the quid.
370,00:20:14,00:20:16,I got to get me one of those.
371,00:20:22,00:20:24,Flash drive.
372,00:20:24,00:20:25,Let's check it out.
373,00:20:32,00:20:33,Okay.
374,00:20:35,00:20:37,Let's see what's in Brooke's folder.
375,00:20:41,00:20:44,"Wow. Okay, so Pete wasn't just hacking messages."
376,00:20:44,00:20:46,He was hacking into e-mails and photos.
377,00:20:46,00:20:47,Mm-hmm.
378,00:20:49,00:20:52,America's favorite virgin's looking pretty virginal.
379,00:20:52,00:20:54,There's nothing really controversial here.
380,00:20:54,00:20:56,Let's check Jake's file.
381,00:21:08,00:21:09,"Okay, wait a minute now."
382,00:21:11,00:21:13,I've seen that tatt before.
383,00:21:13,00:21:17,Where? Climbing out a window at WLVU.
384,00:21:19,00:21:20,That's Sebastian Jones.
385,00:21:20,00:21:23,One of Pete Moyer's buddies.
386,00:21:23,00:21:24,Hmm.
387,00:21:26,00:21:27,Whoa.
388,00:21:27,00:21:29,Looks like he's got another buddy.
389,00:21:29,00:21:32,"That's Brooke's boyfriend, Jake Pychan."
390,00:21:32,00:21:35,Looks like boyfriend's got a beard.
391,00:21:42,00:21:44,Where did you get these?
392,00:21:44,00:21:48,"Not off the computer you stole from Pete Moyer's dorm room, if that's what you mean."
393,00:21:48,00:21:50,We found his computer under your bed.
394,00:21:50,00:21:54,RUSSELL: Those photos were on a flash drive that Pete hid in some dirty clothes.
395,00:21:54,00:21:56,But you didn't think to look there.
396,00:21:56,00:21:58,And they came from your phone.
397,00:21:58,00:21:59,Which Pete hacked into. Son of a bitch.
398,00:21:59,00:22:03,I guess you didn't take that same purity pledge as your girlfriend.
399,00:22:03,00:22:05,That isn't sex.
400,00:22:05,00:22:07,"Oh, I don't think your girlfriend would agree."
401,00:22:07,00:22:09,Does she know you're gay? I'm not gay.
402,00:22:09,00:22:17,"RUSSELL: Gay, straight, your business, or at least it was your business right up until Pete decided to make it everyone else's."
403,00:22:17,00:22:18,BRASS: And then you threw him off the bridge.
404,00:22:18,00:22:20,I didn't touch him.
405,00:22:20,00:22:23,"When I saw him last night at the Theta house, somebody already worked him over pretty good."
406,00:22:23,00:22:26,"Well, then, you won't mind giving us your prints and some DNA?"
407,00:22:26,00:22:28,I have rights.
408,00:22:28,00:22:30,"Yeah, you got rights, but you're a suspect in a murder case."
409,00:22:30,00:22:32,"And we don't have a lot of time, so tell us what happened."
410,00:22:37,00:22:41,Sebastian texted me after Pete was dead.
411,00:22:41,00:22:43,He said...
412,00:22:43,00:22:45,Pete might have some photos of us.
413,00:22:45,00:22:48,"Sebastian already had his phone, so I went for his computer."
414,00:22:48,00:22:51,I just didn't want them getting online.
415,00:22:51,00:23:02,"People wouldn't understand. RUSSELL: Well, then, give us what we need, you know, help us rule you out as a suspect, and if you do, I promise that these photos will get buried in the evidence vault."
416,00:23:02,00:23:03,"We can do that, can't we?"
417,00:23:03,00:23:04,"Yeah, sure."
418,00:23:09,00:23:11,Okay.
419,00:23:11,00:23:12,"Ah. Yeah, there you go."
420,00:23:18,00:23:19,Thank you.
421,00:23:19,00:23:24,JOHNSON: Why does a gossip hound need military-grade encryption for his computer files?
422,00:23:24,00:23:27,"Well, certainly not 'cause he respected anyone's privacy."
423,00:23:27,00:23:31,Probably just didn't want to get scooped himself.
424,00:23:31,00:23:33,"So, how long till you can unscramble it?"
425,00:23:33,00:23:36,This is complicated. I'm gonna need some time.
426,00:23:36,00:23:41,"When I said Pete was taking his paparazzi work seriously, I didn't realize he went full-tilt P.I."
427,00:23:41,00:23:44,Must have dropped a mint at some spy store.
428,00:23:44,00:23:45,What is that?
429,00:23:45,00:23:49,A remote digital receiver.
430,00:23:49,00:23:52,"JOHNSON: Oh, that's top of the line."
431,00:23:52,00:23:53,(beeps) Ah.
432,00:23:53,00:23:56,Still receiving a signal.
433,00:23:56,00:23:57,(keyboarding)
434,00:23:57,00:23:59,That's a live feed from a camera...
435,00:24:00,00:24:03,...mounted somewhere. SANDERS: Maybe an office?
436,00:24:03,00:24:07,This picture's fuzzy 'cause we're at the edge of the camera's broadcast range.
437,00:24:07,00:24:09,Pete Moyer's entire world is WLVU.
438,00:24:09,00:24:12,I guarantee you this room is somewhere on campus.
439,00:24:12,00:24:14,Can you get me a better picture at all?
440,00:24:14,00:24:17,No. You guys should just start walking this thing back towards campus.
441,00:24:20,00:24:27,"Or I could try and do my job, amplify the reception range and get a cleaner image."
442,00:24:27,00:24:28,That's a good idea.
443,00:24:28,00:24:29,Second.
444,00:24:29,00:24:30,Yeah.
445,00:24:33,00:24:35,Hey.
446,00:24:35,00:24:38,Mom insisted. She's worried you're not taking care of yourself.
447,00:24:38,00:24:40,Come on in.
448,00:24:41,00:24:43,Case must be going well.
449,00:24:43,00:24:45,Hear you have a suspect in custody.
450,00:24:47,00:24:48,You're trending.
451,00:24:48,00:24:50,I'll be darned.
452,00:24:50,00:24:53,"So, it's like the court of public opinion in the digital age, right?"
453,00:24:53,00:24:55,Yeah.
454,00:24:55,00:24:58,Oh. What... What do you... what you got there?
455,00:24:58,00:25:01,Are those salt and vinegar chips? Mm-hmm.
456,00:25:01,00:25:04,"(chuckles) Oh, yeah."
457,00:25:05,00:25:07,It's nice to see Finn.
458,00:25:07,00:25:08,Yeah.
459,00:25:08,00:25:10,How's that working for you?
460,00:25:10,00:25:13,It's fine.
461,00:25:13,00:25:15,Why do you ask?
462,00:25:15,00:25:17,Just kind of a drag last time.
463,00:25:19,00:25:21,"Well, second time's a charm."
464,00:25:21,00:25:23,"Yeah, hope so."
465,00:25:23,00:25:25,Mom's not the only one who worries.
466,00:25:29,00:25:31,(quietly): Ugh...
467,00:25:31,00:25:33,BRODY: Finn?
468,00:25:33,00:25:35,"Morgan, did you bring lunch?"
469,00:25:35,00:25:36,We have company.
470,00:25:37,00:25:39,Hi.
471,00:25:39,00:25:40,"Oh, hi."
472,00:25:41,00:25:43,"Um, have a seat."
473,00:25:45,00:25:46,Thank you.
474,00:25:46,00:25:50,"I didn't want to be seen walking into the police department, so, I thought I could talk to you guys instead?"
475,00:25:50,00:25:52,Sure. Of course you can.
476,00:25:52,00:25:57,"I know Jake's been arrested, but he had nothing to do with Pete's death."
477,00:25:57,00:26:00,Really? And why are you so sure about that?
478,00:26:00,00:26:02,Because I was with him... all night.
479,00:26:04,00:26:05,All night?
480,00:26:05,00:26:09,"Yeah, at the party and at the bridge with everyone else, after you guys found Pete."
481,00:26:11,00:26:14,You don't have to have sex to spend the night with someone.
482,00:26:14,00:26:21,"No. No, you don't, and I'm sure it's easier to keep your pledge of purity when your boyfriend's not that into you."
483,00:26:21,00:26:23,"Look, I'm not naive."
484,00:26:23,00:26:26,"When I met Jake, I really liked him."
485,00:26:26,00:26:28,"You know, he was the perfect boyfriend for me."
486,00:26:28,00:26:36,"Sexually confused enough that he would never pressure me to break my vow, which, believe it or not, is very important to me."
487,00:26:36,00:26:44,"Uh, Brooke, we have evidence that Pete knew about Jake's sexual confusion, and may have been planning to out him."
488,00:26:44,00:26:47,BRODY: Is that why you and Pete were fighting at the party?
489,00:26:47,00:26:49,We weren't fighting at the party.
490,00:26:49,00:26:51,"No, it had nothing to do with Jake."
491,00:26:51,00:26:53,Pete was venting about Professor Laudner.
492,00:26:53,00:26:54,BRODY: Professor Laudner?
493,00:26:54,00:26:56,Why? Because Laudner's a douche.
494,00:26:56,00:26:59,"And Pete idolized him, wanted to be just like him."
495,00:26:59,00:27:04,"I don't know what went down between those two, but Pete told me I was right all along."
496,00:27:04,00:27:07,Did he mention a physical altercation that took place with Professor Laudner?
497,00:27:07,00:27:12,"I asked him why his face was all messed up, and he told me to check his next VLOG."
498,00:27:12,00:27:15,That the truth would be revealed.
499,00:27:19,00:27:20,"Hey, Greg."
500,00:27:20,00:27:25,"I tried boosting the reception from Pete's camera, but, uh, the image didn't get much better."
501,00:27:25,00:27:28,"So, I enhanced this one area here."
502,00:27:28,00:27:30,Looks like a poster.
503,00:27:30,00:27:33,"Yeah, for Celebrities Indisposed."
504,00:27:33,00:27:37,Pete's camera is in Tom Laudner's office.
505,00:27:40,00:27:42,(sighs)
506,00:27:47,00:27:48,There's the poster.
507,00:27:48,00:27:51,Camera's got to be somewhere over there.
508,00:27:51,00:27:52,Yeah.
509,00:27:57,00:28:00,Bookcase is a good place to hide a camera.
510,00:28:08,00:28:11,Think I got something on the top shelf.
511,00:28:11,00:28:12,Here it is.
512,00:28:17,00:28:20,And that's what it's looking at.
513,00:28:25,00:28:33,"Yeah, well, there's only one reason why Pete Moyer would want a bird's-eye view of Professor Laudner's couch."
514,00:28:38,00:28:40,"Ah, Professor."
515,00:28:40,00:28:41,Thanks for coming down.
516,00:28:41,00:28:44,Didn't seem like I had a choice.
517,00:28:44,00:28:46,You didn't.
518,00:28:46,00:28:48,"Sit down, please."
519,00:28:48,00:28:50,I have something that I want to show you.
520,00:28:50,00:28:51,Really?
521,00:28:55,00:28:58,That's my office.
522,00:28:58,00:29:01,"Do you have a warrant? Actually, that's university property."
523,00:29:01,00:29:03,"And yeah, they've been served."
524,00:29:03,00:29:06,But you don't have probable cause for any wiretapping or surveillance.
525,00:29:06,00:29:08,"That's true, that's true, we don't."
526,00:29:08,00:29:12,"You see, Pete Moyer put that camera in your office."
527,00:29:12,00:29:13,He's the one who's been watching you.
528,00:29:27,00:29:29,Got a blood drop.
529,00:29:32,00:29:34,Yep. Somebody cleaned up this rug.
530,00:29:48,00:29:53,"If that's Pete Moyer's blood, then he was beaten in this room."
531,00:29:58,00:30:04,"RUSSELL: So, Pete was in your office last night, and the two of you got into a fight."
532,00:30:04,00:30:08,Yeah. That's none of your business. You're pulling the privacy card. Wow.
533,00:30:08,00:30:12,After you made a career out of exposing everyone else's business.
534,00:30:12,00:30:15,"That's a little hypocritical, don't you think?"
535,00:30:15,00:30:16,Guilty.
536,00:30:16,00:30:18,Do you have anything else?
537,00:30:18,00:30:20,"Yeah, actually I do. Thank you."
538,00:30:20,00:30:24,I have blood... on your rug.
539,00:30:24,00:30:27,"See, you tried to clean it up, which makes it my business."
540,00:30:34,00:30:35,"Oh, this thing had quite a workout."
541,00:30:35,00:30:40,Yeah. Maybe one of Laudner's students was riding the extra credit couch.
542,00:30:43,00:30:47,Your office hours must be very stimulating.
543,00:30:47,00:30:49,I'm sorry. Did I miss the question?
544,00:30:49,00:30:54,How many women are enrolled in your Anthropology of Fame class?
545,00:30:54,00:30:55,Thirty-eight.
546,00:30:55,00:30:58,And how many have you had sex with?
547,00:30:58,00:31:05,"Okay, here's what I think happened. I think Pete Moyer found out, confirmed it with his camera, and then threatened to expose you."
548,00:31:05,00:31:08,"Mr. Russell, even gossip is woven with a thread of truth."
549,00:31:08,00:31:14,"Then I think that you tried to rough him up a little bit, but when that didn't work, I think you lured him out to Finals Bridge."
550,00:31:14,00:31:15,"What, and pushed him off?"
551,00:31:15,00:31:17,You thought it would look like a suicide.
552,00:31:17,00:31:20,"Your protégé caught you with your pants down, Professor."
553,00:31:20,00:31:22,"You panicked, you thought that the scandal would ruin you."
554,00:31:22,00:31:24,Are you serious?
555,00:31:24,00:31:32,"Teacher sleeps with students, none of them underage, not the same sex, and all of them consensual."
556,00:31:32,00:31:33,What scandal?
557,00:31:38,00:31:39,"Hey, Nick?"
558,00:31:39,00:31:42,"Come here for a second, will you?"
559,00:31:42,00:31:43,Yeah.
560,00:31:43,00:31:47,I hate it when a suspect blows a hole in a perfectly good theory.
561,00:31:47,00:31:49,Professor Laudner.
562,00:31:49,00:31:56,"Okay, okay, now, so what if Pete Moyer recorded the professor having sex-- consensual sex-- with a student?"
563,00:31:56,00:31:58,Seven different students.
564,00:31:58,00:32:05,"Whoa. According to the vaginal contributions on the couch, he was a busy man. But that just makes him the guy who can. It doesn't make him a killer."
565,00:32:05,00:32:14,"And like he said in his dumb lectures, sex scandal nowadays just means that you got yourself a book tour, a reality show, and a movie deal, for crying out loud."
566,00:32:14,00:32:16,"You're not really letting this guy get to you, are you?"
567,00:32:16,00:32:18,That's beside the point.
568,00:32:18,00:32:21,What I don't see is a motive for killing Pete.
569,00:32:21,00:32:22,We know he punched him.
570,00:32:22,00:32:25,We confirmed it was Pete's blood in Laudner's office.
571,00:32:25,00:32:26,"Okay, but if..."
572,00:32:26,00:32:29,"if the fight wasn't about a sex scandal, then what was it?"
573,00:32:31,00:32:34,You never know what you're gonna see when you turn a camera on.
574,00:32:34,00:32:35,Or what people are gonna do.
575,00:32:35,00:32:38,Maybe Pete saw something more than sex.
576,00:32:38,00:32:43,Maybe Pete saw something Laudner didn't want him to.
577,00:32:43,00:32:46,"I wouldn't put it past Laudner to take advantage of his students, would you?"
578,00:32:46,00:32:49,And maybe not take no for an answer.
579,00:32:49,00:32:50,Maybe.
580,00:32:50,00:32:52,I like that.
581,00:32:52,00:32:56,"Okay, we need to identify these seven women."
582,00:33:01,00:33:04,"(quiet, indistinct chatter)"
583,00:33:06,00:33:08,You see the cops take him away?
584,00:33:08,00:33:11,"Yeah. So it's got to be true, right?"
585,00:33:11,00:33:14,Professor Laudner's been arrested?
586,00:33:14,00:33:16,"Good afternoon, class."
587,00:33:16,00:33:20,"My name is Julie Finlay, and this is Morgan Brody."
588,00:33:20,00:33:22,We work with the Crime Lab.
589,00:33:22,00:33:27,We are here investigating the death of Pete Moyer.
590,00:33:27,00:33:30,We are going to share details with you regarding our homicide investigation.
591,00:33:30,00:33:34,"Now, this information has been withheld from the public."
592,00:33:34,00:33:43,"FINLAY: We discovered epithelials, skin cell DNA, under the victim's fingernails, which tells us that he struggled with his killer in the moments before his death."
593,00:33:43,00:33:51,"(murmuring) BRODY: The way this works, we start by trying to exclude Pete's classmates and friends, in order to zero in on our killer."
594,00:33:51,00:33:56,"Now, in order to do that, we need to collect DNA samples from all of you."
595,00:33:56,00:33:58,What if we refuse?
596,00:33:59,00:34:10,"FINLAY: Well, you do have that legal right-- this is strictly voluntary-- but I would like to ask you all to refrain from spreading false rumors about any classmates who refuse to cooperate."
597,00:34:10,00:34:14,"So no sharing, no posting, no kidding."
598,00:34:18,00:34:20,First volunteers get the clean swabs.
599,00:34:26,00:34:28,I can't believe that just worked. Mm-hmm.
600,00:34:33,00:34:35,"ANDREWS: Hey, Nick."
601,00:34:35,00:34:39,I identified the seven vaginal contributors from the couch in Professor Laudner's office.
602,00:34:39,00:34:41,All these girls were in his class.
603,00:34:43,00:34:45,"All right, I'll have Brass bring them in."
604,00:34:47,00:34:51,"WOMAN: Well, Professor Laudner's office hours are open to every student in the class, so..."
605,00:34:51,00:34:54,are you asking me if I had sex with Professor Laudner?
606,00:34:54,00:34:57,I'm asking you if it was consensual.
607,00:34:57,00:35:08,"I took Laudner's class for an easy ""A."" Everybody knows that if you're a pretty girl, wear a short skirt and sit in the front row, you get an ""A."" Did he promise if you slept with him he'd give you an ""A""?"
608,00:35:08,00:35:11,"He never made any promises, but..."
609,00:35:11,00:35:13,it was understood.
610,00:35:13,00:35:19,"FINLAY: Ashley, we've collected forensic evidence, and we're talking to other girls."
611,00:35:19,00:35:23,We know that Professor Laudner offered sex for grades.
612,00:35:26,00:35:30,I am not accusing you of anything.
613,00:35:30,00:35:35,I just would like to ask if you had consensual sex with Professor Laudner.
614,00:35:39,00:35:41,Did Professor Laudner hurt you?
615,00:35:41,00:35:42,I don't want to talk about it.
616,00:35:45,00:35:48,"Ashley, I know you want to help us find Pete's killer."
617,00:35:50,00:35:55,"I think Pete found out about what happened to you, and then he tried to help you."
618,00:35:55,00:35:57,Pete did not want to help me.
619,00:35:57,00:36:00,Pete only cared about Pete and his damn gossip!
620,00:36:02,00:36:05,"I didn't want to talk to Pete, and I don't want to talk to you."
621,00:36:05,00:36:09,"I have a right to be left alone. Ashley, I understand that..."
622,00:36:09,00:36:17,"but what Pete found out cost him his life, so I need you to help me find out what happened to him, and I need you to let me help you."
623,00:36:17,00:36:19,You can't help me!
624,00:36:19,00:36:20,No one can!
625,00:36:20,00:36:22,I would like to try.
626,00:36:22,00:36:23,I killed Pete!
627,00:36:23,00:36:26,Okay? I was the reason he was at that bridge!
628,00:36:26,00:36:28,I pushed him off!
629,00:36:30,00:36:32,Can you help me now?
630,00:36:32,00:36:34,(sobbing)
631,00:36:34,00:36:36,(continues sobbing)
632,00:36:36,00:36:39,ASHLEY: Get off me! Please!
633,00:36:39,00:36:42,JOHNSON: Finally decrypted Pete's hard drive.
634,00:36:42,00:36:44,Been through all the videos.
635,00:36:44,00:36:45,"A lot of sex, but..."
636,00:36:45,00:36:47,nothing like this.
637,00:36:47,00:36:49,(turns off video)
638,00:36:49,00:36:50,That is so clearly rape.
639,00:36:50,00:36:52,Why wouldn't Ashley have reported it?
640,00:36:52,00:36:55,A lot of shame associated with sexual assault.
641,00:36:55,00:36:58,Especially if the rapist is known to the victim.
642,00:36:58,00:37:05,"So, Mandy matched three unknown sets of prints from the bridge to the ten-card that Finlay collected from Ashley Benson."
643,00:37:05,00:37:08,So she was there? Yeah.
644,00:37:08,00:37:11,"The problem is, there's an inconsistency with her confession."
645,00:37:11,00:37:13,Mind if I get in there?
646,00:37:13,00:37:14,So...
647,00:37:14,00:37:17,all of her prints are on...
648,00:37:17,00:37:18,this lamppost.
649,00:37:18,00:37:21,The first set is at approximately five feet.
650,00:37:21,00:37:24,The highest is a little over eight.
651,00:37:24,00:37:26,"Well, Ashley's about my height, so..."
652,00:37:28,00:37:30,Here's your first set of prints.
653,00:37:30,00:37:35,"Okay. Add what, 18 inches for the bench?"
654,00:37:49,00:37:51,There's your second set of prints.
655,00:37:51,00:37:54,"Well, another 18 inches, and you're at eight feet."
656,00:37:54,00:37:58,Looks like you might need a little help to get there.
657,00:38:06,00:38:07,Ashley was climbing.
658,00:38:07,00:38:10,Yep. Right onto the ledge.
659,00:38:18,00:38:22,Pete followed me to the bridge...
660,00:38:22,00:38:25,ambushed me as I was leaving the party.
661,00:38:25,00:38:30,He said he knew what Laudner had done to me and he'd seen it with his own eyes. So he...
662,00:38:30,00:38:38,"told you about the tape? Yeah, he said he was gonna post it on his Web site and that he wanted my exclusive."
663,00:38:38,00:38:39,I knew the rumors.
664,00:38:39,00:38:43,I knew that some of the girls were sleeping with him.
665,00:38:44,00:38:46,(crying): But I'm not like that.
666,00:38:46,00:38:48,(sobbing)
667,00:38:48,00:38:55,"I should have taken the ""C."" I was trying so hard to get into business school, and..."
668,00:38:55,00:38:58,"Ashley, you did nothing wrong; nothing."
669,00:38:58,00:39:00,Have you seen it?
670,00:39:01,00:39:04,The tape is evidence.
671,00:39:04,00:39:07,(sobbing): So it's gonna be everywhere.
672,00:39:09,00:39:11,I need you to tell me what happened.
673,00:39:11,00:39:15,(laughs): I... I thought Pete was there because he actually cared about me.
674,00:39:20,00:39:22,"PETE: Look, forget my VLOG."
675,00:39:22,00:39:24,I'll go with you to the cops; we'll talk to them together.
676,00:39:24,00:39:27,It doesn't matter! He raped me!
677,00:39:27,00:39:28,You don't have to do this.
678,00:39:28,00:39:33,"He said we couldn't give up, and that I couldn't let Laudner win."
679,00:39:33,00:39:35,I want it to be over!
680,00:39:35,00:39:36,Come here.
681,00:39:36,00:39:39,Take my hand.
682,00:39:39,00:39:40,"Hey, you have to trust me."
683,00:39:42,00:39:47,"And then I turned around, and he had his phone out."
684,00:39:47,00:39:52,"He was recording us, or-or texting, or tweeting, I don't know, but..."
685,00:39:52,00:39:55,I knocked it out of his hand.
686,00:40:02,00:40:05,(Pete yelling)
687,00:40:05,00:40:14,"(sobbing): If I just hadn't gone into Laudner's office, Pete would still be alive! Ashley, from what you're telling me, it was an accident."
688,00:40:14,00:40:15,It was not your fault.
689,00:40:15,00:40:18,Okay? None of this is your fault.
690,00:40:18,00:40:22,"Not Pete's death, and certainly not what Laudner did to you."
691,00:40:22,00:40:26,I lived with it for 13 days.
692,00:40:26,00:40:27,I went to class.
693,00:40:27,00:40:31,I worked at my job.
694,00:40:31,00:40:32,I talked to my parents.
695,00:40:32,00:40:34,I just...
696,00:40:34,00:40:38,"I boxed it up, and I put it on a shelf."
697,00:40:38,00:40:47,"Ashley, listen to me: I am gonna have experts testify to your behavior, so that when you take the stand, the jury will know why you went back to that class."
698,00:40:47,00:40:49,A jury?
699,00:40:49,00:40:52,I-I can't stand in front of a jury.
700,00:40:52,00:40:55,There is no hope of stopping Laudner if you don't.
701,00:40:55,00:40:57,That's not my problem.
702,00:40:58,00:41:02,I just want to be left alone.
703,00:41:02,00:41:04,Please.
704,00:41:13,00:41:17,(Finlay sighs)
705,00:41:17,00:41:18,BRASS: You know I talked to the D.A.
706,00:41:18,00:41:20,She's not gonna file on just the tape.
707,00:41:20,00:41:25,"Which means the guy walks. Yeah, and the bastard's gonna go do it again to another girl."
708,00:41:25,00:41:26,We have to take our victims as they come.
709,00:41:35,00:41:36,"CHARLIE: Hey, Dad."
710,00:41:36,00:41:37,Oh. Hey.
711,00:41:37,00:41:39,You look terrible.
712,00:41:39,00:41:41,"Oh, thanks a lot."
713,00:41:41,00:41:42,Were we supposed to be doing something?
714,00:41:42,00:41:46,"No, but Mom thought it would be cool if we all met up for dinner."
715,00:41:46,00:41:49,"Oh, that sounds fun."
716,00:41:49,00:41:53,"Something wrong? Well, some cases don't end up the way you want them to."
717,00:41:53,00:41:56,"Yeah, but this one did, right?"
718,00:41:56,00:41:57,No.
719,00:41:57,00:41:59,Really? Check it out.
720,00:41:59,00:42:02,It's all over the Internet-- Professor Laudner raped a student.
721,00:42:02,00:42:05,"Ah. News travels fast, doesn't it?"
722,00:42:05,00:42:08,The university suspended him.
723,00:42:08,00:42:09,What?
724,00:42:09,00:42:11,"I mean, look at all these posts."
725,00:42:11,00:42:13,It's not like he's gonna get away with it.
726,00:42:16,00:42:17,Yeah.
727,00:42:17,00:42:19,So...
728,00:42:19,00:42:21,"this is what you call trending, right?"
729,00:42:21,00:42:24,Mm-hmm.
730,00:42:24,00:42:26,(chuckles)
731,00:42:26,00:42:28,Let's go meet your mother.
732,00:42:28,00:42:30,Yeah? Yeah.
