0,00:00:28,00:00:29,Woman: What's taking you so long?
1,00:00:29,00:00:31,I just wanted you to fix the leak.
2,00:00:31,00:00:37,"Look, lady, to fix the leak I need to find the leak."
3,00:00:43,00:00:44,(material ripping)
4,00:00:44,00:00:46,Hold on.
5,00:00:46,00:00:47,You find the leak?
6,00:00:47,00:00:50,(grunts)
7,00:00:51,00:00:53,Plumber: I found something.
8,00:01:05,00:01:07,"Okay, I'm ready up here."
9,00:01:07,00:01:09,Hang on a minute.
10,00:01:14,00:01:15,"Okay, I'm there."
11,00:01:15,00:01:18,Stokes (over radio): Can you confirm it's human?
12,00:01:18,00:01:21,"Medicarpal, phalanges..."
13,00:01:21,00:01:24,No question about it.
14,00:01:26,00:01:29,"Hold on, Nick."
15,00:01:30,00:01:32,There's got to be an easier way.
16,00:01:32,00:01:37,"When a body decomposes in concrete it leaves an air pocket, vacuum-sealed."
17,00:01:37,00:01:41,"If we do this right, it'll open like a jar of pickles."
18,00:01:57,00:02:00,Ten bucks says the owner sells the house.
19,00:02:00,00:02:06,"Grissom: By law, you've got to disclose everything-- three bedrooms, two baths, and a skeleton."
20,00:02:40,00:02:41,"Okay, I'm late again."
21,00:02:41,00:02:45,Nick's going to work with me on that unidentified body at Summercliff.
22,00:02:45,00:02:48,I hear it's just bones? What a rush.
23,00:02:48,00:02:49,O.I.S. at the Jockey Club.
24,00:02:49,00:02:50,Officer-involved shooting.
25,00:02:50,00:02:52,I'll take a piece of that.
26,00:02:52,00:02:53,"Good, I want you to double up."
27,00:02:53,00:02:56,"Listen, these deals are never easy so keep me informed, please."
28,00:02:56,00:02:58,Will do. I drive.
29,00:02:58,00:02:59,Picture that.
30,00:02:59,00:03:02,So what do you have for me?
31,00:03:02,00:03:03,I could use a rush.
32,00:03:03,00:03:05,"Well, this qualifies, 4-26."
33,00:03:05,00:03:07,But I can't give you the case.
34,00:03:08,00:03:09,Because?
35,00:03:09,00:03:11,Conflict of interest.
36,00:03:11,00:03:14,The alleged rape victim's an exotic dancer.
37,00:03:18,00:03:21,"Because I used to be one, I'll be biased?"
38,00:03:21,00:03:22,No.
39,00:03:22,00:03:24,The suspect's your ex-husband.
40,00:03:32,00:03:34,"He's asking for you, but you can't take it."
41,00:03:37,00:03:40,Just let me do the prelim.
42,00:03:43,00:03:44,All right.
43,00:03:44,00:03:46,Do what you can.
44,00:03:46,00:03:50,"But after the preliminary, you pass it off, okay?"
45,00:04:14,00:04:17,Thank God you're here.
46,00:04:18,00:04:19,Eddie.
47,00:04:19,00:04:21,I didn't rape that girl.
48,00:04:21,00:04:25,According to the police report she's telling a different story.
49,00:04:25,00:04:28,I wonder what the rape kit's going to say.
50,00:04:28,00:04:29,"We had sex, okay?"
51,00:04:29,00:04:33,Butshewas there with me 100%.
52,00:04:35,00:04:38,In the parking lot behind the club.
53,00:04:38,00:04:40,"Well, some women like the outdoors."
54,00:04:44,00:04:45,Melanie know about this?
55,00:04:45,00:04:48,Mel and I split up a while ago.
56,00:04:48,00:04:49,You might want to call her anyway.
57,00:04:49,00:04:52,She can loan you the money for an attorney.
58,00:04:52,00:04:53,You're not going to help me?
59,00:04:53,00:04:54,"Cath, I am in a jam here!"
60,00:04:54,00:04:56,A detective from Sex Crime's been assigned.
61,00:04:56,00:04:58,I'm going to place another CSI.
62,00:04:58,00:04:59,What about Lindsey?
63,00:05:00,00:05:01,What about her?
64,00:05:02,00:05:08,"You want her spending Sunday afternoons with me at Nevada State Prison, or the mall?"
65,00:05:11,00:05:16,Based on the auricular surface I'd say she died when she was about 20.
66,00:05:16,00:05:18,She?
67,00:05:18,00:05:20,It's in the hips.
68,00:05:20,00:05:23,The pelvic bone is definitely female.
69,00:05:23,00:05:26,"You know, for a ladies' man you don't know much about bone structure."
70,00:05:26,00:05:28,I know all I need to know.
71,00:05:28,00:05:33,I figure she was killed before her cement bath.
72,00:05:33,00:05:34,"Yeah, how?"
73,00:05:34,00:05:42,She was stabbed at least a dozen times a screwdriver maybe or a spike.
74,00:05:42,00:05:45,"No, the gouges on her ribs are unusual."
75,00:05:45,00:05:52,The instrument had to be... slightly curved with some kind of serrated edge.
76,00:05:54,00:05:57,Like crocodile teeth.
77,00:05:57,00:06:01,Whatever killed this girl it was not a traditional weapon.
78,00:06:03,00:06:04,"Well, stabbings are personal."
79,00:06:04,00:06:06,She knew her attacker.
80,00:06:06,00:06:08,That's the rule.
81,00:06:15,00:06:17,Who are you?
82,00:06:21,00:06:23,"Sara Sidle, Warrick Brown Officer Joe Tyner."
83,00:06:23,00:06:25,Hi.
84,00:06:25,00:06:26,Hi.
85,00:06:26,00:06:27,Officer Tyner.
86,00:06:27,00:06:28,How are you doing?
87,00:06:28,00:06:30,Tell us what happened here tonight.
88,00:06:30,00:06:33,He responded to shots fired the suspect fled the scene.
89,00:06:33,00:06:36,Why don't you tell us what happened here.
90,00:06:37,00:06:41,(tires squealing)
91,00:06:41,00:06:45,Unit Five. I'm in pursuit of the fleeing 413 heading southbound on the Strip.
92,00:06:46,00:06:48,(tires squealing)
93,00:06:50,00:06:52,Get back into the car!
94,00:06:52,00:06:54,Drop your keys to the ground!
95,00:06:54,00:06:55,Put your hands on the wheel!
96,00:06:55,00:06:57,I didn't do it!
97,00:06:57,00:06:58,Whatever you think I did!
98,00:06:58,00:07:00,I'm looking at three strikes.
99,00:07:00,00:07:01,I'm not going back.
100,00:07:01,00:07:03,I'll show you my registration.
101,00:07:03,00:07:04,"No, put your hands on the wheel!"
102,00:07:04,00:07:05,(fires gun)
103,00:07:05,00:07:09,"Then he turned the weapon on himself and one shot, right through the forehead."
104,00:07:09,00:07:11,Where's his gun?
105,00:07:11,00:07:12,I left it in the jeep.
106,00:07:13,00:07:14,I'm going to go bag it.
107,00:07:14,00:07:16,"Officer, we're going to need your weapon as well."
108,00:07:16,00:07:18,I never fired.
109,00:07:18,00:07:19,Drawn but not fired.
110,00:07:19,00:07:21,It's just standard procedure.
111,00:07:23,00:07:25,It's okay. It's all right.
112,00:07:41,00:07:43,Brown: We're going to need to seal off this lot.
113,00:07:43,00:07:45,Tyner told you what happened here.
114,00:07:45,00:07:47,Whose side are you on?
115,00:07:47,00:07:50,The officer told me a fleeing suspect committed suicide.
116,00:07:50,00:07:52,I'm just verifying his account.
117,00:07:52,00:07:54,"You know how this works, Brass."
118,00:07:54,00:07:56,Can we clear the jeep so I can do my job?
119,00:07:56,00:07:59,"Well, at least test the dead guy's hands for gun residue."
120,00:07:59,00:08:02,At that proximity G.S.R.'s invalid.
121,00:08:02,00:08:04,"They'd both be covered, no matter who fired."
122,00:08:04,00:08:06,Can we get back to work?
123,00:08:06,00:08:07,Yeah.
124,00:08:12,00:08:14,(light buzzing)
125,00:08:15,00:08:18,(door opens)
126,00:08:19,00:08:22,You brought the foundation of the house to our lab.
127,00:08:22,00:08:25,It's a six-by-three-foot section.
128,00:08:25,00:08:31,When the concrete dried it preserved a partial impression of our Jane Doe.
129,00:08:32,00:08:34,Did you find out anything about the house?
130,00:08:34,00:08:36,I pulled the permits.
131,00:08:36,00:08:38,Summercliff was built five years ago on nothing but desert.
132,00:08:39,00:08:42,That would explain why the body was so desiccated.
133,00:08:42,00:08:47,House was sold subsequent to completion so the homeowner isn't a suspect.
134,00:08:47,00:08:49,Homicide is running a missing persons check.
135,00:08:49,00:08:51,(clears throat)
136,00:08:54,00:09:00,"Well, if it wasn't for a leaky pipe she might have been down there forever."
137,00:09:00,00:09:03,I think our killer was counting on that.
138,00:09:11,00:09:12,Hey.
139,00:09:14,00:09:18,Why would a guy speed it all the way down the Strip just to pull over and cap himself?
140,00:09:18,00:09:22,"What are you getting at, Warrick?"
141,00:09:22,00:09:26,"Officer's weapon, Smith and Wesson 5906."
142,00:09:26,00:09:28,Standard issue.
143,00:09:28,00:09:31,One bullet missing.
144,00:09:31,00:09:33,Nothing standard about that.
145,00:09:38,00:09:40,Brass isn't going to like this.
146,00:09:40,00:09:42,I don't give a damn what Brass likes.
147,00:09:42,00:09:44,Like I do?
148,00:09:44,00:09:46,"If Tyner's dirty, he goes down."
149,00:09:46,00:09:49,I just know what happens when you piss off the P.D.
150,00:09:49,00:09:53,"Yeah, it's war."
151,00:09:55,00:09:57,Gil Grissom?
152,00:09:59,00:10:02,Or should I call you Spider Man?
153,00:10:02,00:10:03,It's harmless.
154,00:10:03,00:10:05,Of course it is.
155,00:10:05,00:10:08,Orange-kneed tarantula.
156,00:10:08,00:10:09,Nice specimen.
157,00:10:09,00:10:12,The tarantula's touch is very gentle.
158,00:10:12,00:10:14,It leaves no prints.
159,00:10:14,00:10:15,They move without a trace.
160,00:10:16,00:10:17,May I?
161,00:10:26,00:10:28,Maybe I should introduce myself.
162,00:10:28,00:10:30,Teri Miller does not need an introduction.
163,00:10:32,00:10:33,I need you to make me a face.
164,00:10:38,00:10:39,I didn't kill him.
165,00:10:40,00:10:41,That's what I told IA.
166,00:10:41,00:10:43,It's what I told my superior.
167,00:10:43,00:10:44,It's what I'm telling you.
168,00:10:44,00:10:47,"Officer Tyner, your gun-- there's a bullet's missing from the magazine."
169,00:10:47,00:10:48,I don't top off.
170,00:10:48,00:10:53,"I know it's against regulation, but the 14th bullet puts pressure on the spring and the gun can jam."
171,00:10:53,00:10:55,Can anyone confirm your story?
172,00:10:55,00:10:56,It's not a story!
173,00:10:56,00:10:58,And no...
174,00:10:58,00:11:01,I don't tell people how I carry. Do you?
175,00:11:01,00:11:03,Check the other magazines.
176,00:11:03,00:11:05,What the hell's going on here?
177,00:11:05,00:11:08,We're just having a talk with Officer Tyner here.
178,00:11:08,00:11:09,"Next time, don't start without me."
179,00:11:09,00:11:10,I'm the union rep on this one.
180,00:11:10,00:11:13,Then you should know. Tyner's magazine-- one bullet shy.
181,00:11:13,00:11:16,Is the expended round still missing?
182,00:11:16,00:11:19,"It's not in the body, bullet's a round point wound was a through-and-through."
183,00:11:19,00:11:21,I did not fire a single round.
184,00:11:21,00:11:24,And with a record like yours we're supposed to just take your word?
185,00:11:24,00:11:28,Warrick: Five civilian complaints-- three for excessive force.
186,00:11:28,00:11:30,Two IA investigations.
187,00:11:30,00:11:32,I was cleared.
188,00:11:32,00:11:34,I'm sure you were.
189,00:11:34,00:11:37,What is that supposed to mean? I don't have to take this crap!
190,00:11:37,00:11:41,"Tyner... sit down, sit down."
191,00:11:43,00:11:47,What you do need is for these guys to go out and find the missing bullet.
192,00:11:47,00:11:50,So what are you waiting for?
193,00:11:50,00:11:55,I guess it's a good thing I sealed off that crime scene.
194,00:11:58,00:12:02,It's like a human Jell-O mold.
195,00:12:02,00:12:04,The impression's only a partial.
196,00:12:04,00:12:06,It's not going to be easy.
197,00:12:06,00:12:09,They told me you were the top forensic artist in the country.
198,00:12:09,00:12:13,And Canada. I didn't say I couldn't do it.
199,00:12:17,00:12:19,Give me your hand.
200,00:12:19,00:12:21,You'll enjoy this.
201,00:12:21,00:12:24,It's as much science as art.
202,00:12:48,00:12:49,It doesn't really look like anything.
203,00:12:49,00:12:52,"Miller: No light, no shadows."
204,00:12:52,00:12:55,"No shadows, no perspective."
205,00:12:55,00:12:56,Now look.
206,00:13:03,00:13:05,So teach me.
207,00:13:05,00:13:06,Okay.
208,00:13:06,00:13:09,First I'm finishing off the plaster mold.
209,00:13:10,00:13:13,We can't give her life with only half a face.
210,00:13:13,00:13:24,Although not actually symmetrical most faces appear that way and the thin layer of slip makes the plaster and clay appear seamless.
211,00:13:27,00:13:32,Her cheekbones and nasal spine indicate Nordic descent.
212,00:13:32,00:13:37,I've seen a few Norwegian brunettes but your girl's probably a blonde.
213,00:13:47,00:13:48,Grissom: Brown eyes?
214,00:13:48,00:13:51,I thought you decided she was Nordic.
215,00:13:51,00:13:55,"But in this country, brown is a dominant eye color and more importantly, brown photographs better."
216,00:13:55,00:13:58,"You want to get her face out there, don't you?"
217,00:13:58,00:14:01,Yeah.
218,00:14:01,00:14:07,I'm sure someone needs closure and somebody else needs to go to jail.
219,00:14:09,00:14:11,Miller: There she is.
220,00:14:22,00:14:28,As we first reported yesterday the remains of an unidentified Caucasian female were unearthed in Summercliff.
221,00:14:28,00:14:31,"The 5'4"" woman was approximately 20 years old."
222,00:14:31,00:14:33,Here you go.
223,00:14:33,00:14:36,Authorities are asking for the public's help in identifying the victim.
224,00:14:36,00:14:41,If you have any information please call the Las Vegas P.D. hotline.
225,00:14:41,00:14:44,Hotlines... hit or miss.
226,00:14:44,00:14:49,I don't know. In my experience people usually remember a beautiful woman.
227,00:14:54,00:14:58,"Uh, Nick, weren't you going to go and do the, uh... at the...?"
228,00:14:58,00:15:00,Stokes: Yeah.
229,00:15:00,00:15:03,"Yeah, okay, I'll do that."
230,00:15:05,00:15:07,So I saw Eddie.
231,00:15:10,00:15:14,He actually... seemed scared.
232,00:15:14,00:15:17,Did that make you happy?
233,00:15:17,00:15:18,"Um, no."
234,00:15:18,00:15:23,I'm not really sure what I feel.
235,00:15:26,00:15:28,You're not still in love with Eddie?
236,00:15:30,00:15:32,"Catherine, you have to hand off the case."
237,00:15:32,00:15:35,Warrick can just double up.
238,00:15:35,00:15:37,"Uh, Grissom, Dr. Robbins wants to see you."
239,00:15:37,00:15:40,Something about your skeleton.
240,00:15:40,00:15:41,Okay.
241,00:15:49,00:15:52,You have to pass off the case.
242,00:15:52,00:15:55,If you compromise the investigation there's no going back.
243,00:15:55,00:15:58,You could hurt Eddie just as much as you could help him.
244,00:16:06,00:16:08,Hey. I've already seen the marks on the ribs.
245,00:16:08,00:16:13,"Uh-huh, but did you see the hairline fracture on the posterior skull?"
246,00:16:13,00:16:15,No.
247,00:16:15,00:16:19,"Robbins: Easy to miss, but it screams blunt-force trauma."
248,00:16:19,00:16:22,"Also, the middle ear has three bones."
249,00:16:22,00:16:29,They're dusted with sodium and lodged against the malleus I found a tiny ball of earwax with grains of sand.
250,00:16:32,00:16:34,Salt and sand.
251,00:16:35,00:16:37,Killed at the beach?
252,00:16:37,00:16:39,Not ruling it out.
253,00:16:39,00:16:40,Stokes: Grissom.
254,00:16:40,00:16:42,"Hey, Doc."
255,00:16:42,00:16:43,Hotline's lit up.
256,00:16:43,00:16:48,Five callers all ID'd the same woman and her mother just confirmed.
257,00:16:52,00:16:57,I need to know what happened to my daughter.
258,00:16:57,00:17:02,We're trying to figure that out for you.
259,00:17:02,00:17:04,"She was quite an athlete, huh?"
260,00:17:04,00:17:06,"Mm-hmm, yeah."
261,00:17:08,00:17:09,Did she scuba dive?
262,00:17:09,00:17:11,She'd just been certified.
263,00:17:11,00:17:19,"Did, uh, Fay before she disappeared, go on any vacation go diving or spend time at the beach?"
264,00:17:19,00:17:21,"No, not that I recall."
265,00:17:21,00:17:28,"And she, uh lived here with you until she disappeared?"
266,00:17:28,00:17:31,"No, she had just moved in with her boyfriend, Jason Hendler."
267,00:17:31,00:17:34,He still lives on Medley Place.
268,00:17:34,00:17:39,"Grissom: And the, uh police interviewed him after she disappeared?"
269,00:17:39,00:17:40,A couple of times.
270,00:17:40,00:17:42,He had nothing to do with this.
271,00:17:42,00:17:44,"Well, how do you know that?"
272,00:17:45,00:17:47,He loved my daughter.
273,00:17:47,00:17:49,He was good to her.
274,00:17:49,00:17:53,Did they... ever fight?
275,00:17:53,00:17:58,The first few months of a relationship nobody fights.
276,00:18:00,00:18:03,She was crazy about him.
277,00:18:03,00:18:06,(sobbing)
278,00:18:15,00:18:17,I've given Eddie Willows 20 lap dances.
279,00:18:17,00:18:18,He never got rough till last night.
280,00:18:19,00:18:20,In the parking lot.
281,00:18:20,00:18:28,"Yeah, he asked me to go for drinks you know, but out in the parking lot he starts kissing on me and I kind of laughed it off, but..."
282,00:18:28,00:18:36,then he grabbed me and he slams me against the wall and... that pig.
283,00:18:36,00:18:40,"Hi, Evans I'm sorry I'm late."
284,00:18:40,00:18:41,I'm Catherine...
285,00:18:41,00:18:42,just Catherine.
286,00:18:42,00:18:44,I'm a forensic scientist.
287,00:18:44,00:18:47,"Scientist, wow, you look so normal."
288,00:18:47,00:18:49,Thanks.
289,00:18:49,00:18:51,"Catherine, you sure want...?"
290,00:18:51,00:18:53,Yeah.
291,00:18:55,00:18:57,Are those bruises from last night?
292,00:18:57,00:19:01,"Yeah, a guy pinned me against a wall."
293,00:19:01,00:19:03,Sexual assault nurse collect a kit yet?
294,00:19:03,00:19:04,Evans: She just finished.
295,00:19:04,00:19:06,Why don't you see if you can catch her.
296,00:19:06,00:19:08,I'd like her to get a sample from under her fingernails.
297,00:19:12,00:19:15,Uh... what kind of sample?
298,00:19:15,00:19:19,"Anything that might, uh, show up from a... a struggle."
299,00:19:19,00:19:23,You'd think what that nurse took down below would be enough.
300,00:19:24,00:19:27,The weird thing is...
301,00:19:27,00:19:29,I liked the guy.
302,00:19:38,00:19:41,It's not here.
303,00:19:41,00:19:44,Bullets just don't disappear.
304,00:19:44,00:19:45,Sidel: Excuse me.
305,00:19:45,00:19:48,No one's allowed inside the tape.
306,00:19:48,00:19:49,I saw what happened.
307,00:19:51,00:19:53,Have you talked to the police?
308,00:19:53,00:19:55,Police make me nervous.
309,00:19:55,00:19:57,"You guys aren't cops, are you?"
310,00:19:57,00:20:00,We're crime scene investigators.
311,00:20:00,00:20:01,We need to know what you saw.
312,00:20:01,00:20:06,"I was kind of taking a break, hanging out in a PT Cruiser."
313,00:20:06,00:20:10,I was laid back in the heated driver's seat when I heard the siren.
314,00:20:10,00:20:12,(siren blaring)
315,00:20:12,00:20:14,Tyner: Put your hands on the wheel!
316,00:20:14,00:20:16,Suspect: I didn't do it!
317,00:20:16,00:20:18,Whatever you think I did!
318,00:20:18,00:20:21,"Man, I'm looking at three strikes. I'm not going back."
319,00:20:21,00:20:23,Just let me show you my registration.
320,00:20:23,00:20:24,No! Hands on the wheel!
321,00:20:27,00:20:29,"And just like that, the officer fired?"
322,00:20:29,00:20:31,Just like that.
323,00:20:31,00:20:34,"Sidel: Missing bullet, eyewitness..."
324,00:20:34,00:20:36,we better tell Grissom we got a war.
325,00:20:50,00:20:51,I heard about your eyewitness.
326,00:20:51,00:20:55,A valet who joyrides.
327,00:20:55,00:20:56,He sounds reliable.
328,00:20:56,00:21:00,"So, uh, how's the thing going on Eddie Willows?"
329,00:21:00,00:21:01,What thing?
330,00:21:01,00:21:06,The thing that I told Catherine to pass off to you.
331,00:21:06,00:21:07,"Oh, good, um..."
332,00:21:08,00:21:10,We just put some stuff through the lab.
333,00:21:10,00:21:12,Get hold of the DMV?
334,00:21:12,00:21:14,I was just about to.
335,00:21:15,00:21:18,Warrick? Why would you call the DMV on a rape charge?
336,00:21:21,00:21:24,"Okay, I didn't hand it off."
337,00:21:24,00:21:25,Really?
338,00:21:25,00:21:27,"I'm sorry, Warrick."
339,00:21:27,00:21:30,"If you want me to suave anyone, I've got to know the shot."
340,00:21:30,00:21:32,I know. I'm sorry.
341,00:21:35,00:21:37,I'm doing this for Lindsey.
342,00:21:37,00:21:41,"You so much as breathe on the evidence, it's contaminated and I end up the bad guy."
343,00:21:41,00:21:43,"Eyes, no hands."
344,00:21:43,00:21:45,What's the status?
345,00:21:45,00:21:50,Skin samples from under the woman's fingernails are consistent with Ed's.
346,00:21:50,00:21:57,I saw some bruises but Eddie's style has always been very...
347,00:21:57,00:21:58,involved...
348,00:21:58,00:21:59,vigorous.
349,00:22:00,00:22:01,Vigorous?
350,00:22:02,00:22:04,She's trying to tell you Eddie likes it rough.
351,00:22:04,00:22:06,"Thank you, Warrick."
352,00:22:06,00:22:08,Eddie said that she was into it.
353,00:22:09,00:22:10,"He said, she said?"
354,00:22:10,00:22:12,"It's about the evidence, Catherine."
355,00:22:14,00:22:16,And you may not like where it takes you.
356,00:22:20,00:22:23,"So how many grains of sand in the ocean, huh?"
357,00:22:23,00:22:26,"I don't care about the ocean, just the sand in my skeleton."
358,00:22:26,00:22:28,Can you pinpoint a beach?
359,00:22:28,00:22:29,I don't know.
360,00:22:29,00:22:31,I might have to do some field research.
361,00:22:31,00:22:33,"Hey, you think Grissom would send me to Hawaii?"
362,00:22:34,00:22:36,Why don't you ask him yourself?
363,00:22:36,00:22:39,Ask me what?
364,00:22:39,00:22:40,"Oh, nothing, I, uh..."
365,00:22:40,00:22:42,I was just telling Nick about your sand.
366,00:22:42,00:22:45,"Well, it's not sand."
367,00:22:45,00:22:46,It's not natural anyway.
368,00:22:46,00:22:47,"Here, check this out."
369,00:22:49,00:22:52,"Now, if this were natural sand, the surface would be smooth."
370,00:22:52,00:22:56,Now this looks more like Fremont Street on a Saturday night...
371,00:22:56,00:22:57,rough.
372,00:22:57,00:23:00,Could the particles be sediment from the concrete where we found her?
373,00:23:00,00:23:02,"No, no way."
374,00:23:02,00:23:05,I analyzed the mineral content. It's feldspar and quartz.
375,00:23:05,00:23:07,That's crushed gray sandstone.
376,00:23:07,00:23:10,"It's man-made, in a rock crusher."
377,00:23:10,00:23:11,What does that mean?
378,00:23:11,00:23:13,It means she wasn't killed in Hawaii.
379,00:23:13,00:23:15,Other than that...
380,00:23:15,00:23:17,he has no idea.
381,00:23:22,00:23:24,"Is this payback, Warrick? Is that what this is?"
382,00:23:24,00:23:26,"I was tough on you, so Officer Tyner takes my heat?"
383,00:23:26,00:23:28,That's how you think I work?
384,00:23:28,00:23:30,"Brass, this has nothing to do with anything."
385,00:23:30,00:23:35,The D.A. has filed charges and on the testimony of a bleary-eyed car jockey who was 40 feet from the jeep.
386,00:23:35,00:23:39,Eyewitness is a bonus: Your cop's magazine was one bullet shy.
387,00:23:39,00:23:41,"That's you CSIs, always counting bullets."
388,00:23:41,00:23:44,What's he doing here?
389,00:23:44,00:23:49,You show up with your latex gloves and your little fancy metal boxes and your little powders...
390,00:23:49,00:23:54,You have no idea what it's like to put your life on the line every day!
391,00:23:54,00:23:57,"Oh, you mean dealing with punk-ass cops who hide behind their union reps?"
392,00:23:57,00:23:58,Brass: Hey!
393,00:24:00,00:24:01,You're just a psycho.
394,00:24:01,00:24:02,You don't deserve a badge.
395,00:24:02,00:24:03,Cut it out!
396,00:24:04,00:24:05,"Not in my lab, pal."
397,00:24:05,00:24:06,Scientists!
398,00:24:06,00:24:11,I bet you've never even drawn your weapon.
399,00:24:11,00:24:12,"Yeah, I hope I never have to."
400,00:24:12,00:24:13,"Nick, walk this guy out the door."
401,00:24:13,00:24:16,"Now, let's go."
402,00:24:16,00:24:17,Sara.
403,00:24:17,00:24:18,"Yeah, come on, Warrick."
404,00:24:18,00:24:20,Let's cool down.
405,00:24:20,00:24:21,"This is your fault, Gil."
406,00:24:21,00:24:24,Your nose is so far down a microscope you have no idea what your people are doing.
407,00:24:24,00:24:28,"Yeah, I know one thing: My guys will not bend and they will not be intimidated."
408,00:24:28,00:24:30,"Yeah, I sat in your chair."
409,00:24:30,00:24:32,Your guys have one job: to find the evidence.
410,00:24:32,00:24:35,So where the hell is the missing bullet?
411,00:24:35,00:24:37,Huh?
412,00:24:59,00:25:02,Eddie?
413,00:25:02,00:25:04,Catherine.
414,00:25:04,00:25:06,I'll take a root beer.
415,00:25:06,00:25:08,What are you doing here?
416,00:25:08,00:25:10,I knew you'd be here.
417,00:25:10,00:25:13,"You got a routine: Turkey club, no bacon."
418,00:25:15,00:25:16,You could be a detective.
419,00:25:16,00:25:18,Thank you.
420,00:25:18,00:25:19,(sighs)
421,00:25:19,00:25:22,"Well, you obviously made bail."
422,00:25:22,00:25:23,Did you get a lawyer?
423,00:25:23,00:25:26,I got you and the truth. Who needs a lawyer?
424,00:25:31,00:25:34,I came to tell you how great you are.
425,00:25:34,00:25:36,It always comes out wrong.
426,00:25:36,00:25:39,"When I married you, I married up."
427,00:25:40,00:25:41,I know that.
428,00:25:48,00:25:50,It wasn't all bad.
429,00:25:59,00:26:03,You think the bullet's somewhere in the jeep.
430,00:26:03,00:26:04,It's not in the body.
431,00:26:04,00:26:07,It's not at the crime scene.
432,00:26:07,00:26:11,I like our odds.
433,00:26:11,00:26:13,Let's do it.
434,00:26:27,00:26:29,(wrench grinding)
435,00:26:45,00:26:47,(metal clanging)
436,00:26:55,00:26:57,We have searched every single piece of metal.
437,00:26:57,00:26:58,I think hide and seek is over.
438,00:26:59,00:27:01,(sighing)
439,00:27:01,00:27:02,Yeah.
440,00:27:02,00:27:06,We've searched every piece ofmetal.
441,00:27:11,00:27:14,Spare tire.
442,00:27:30,00:27:33,Sara: You've got to be kidding me.
443,00:27:33,00:27:36,The tire sucked up the bullet and the treads covered its tracks.
444,00:27:37,00:27:40,"We match the bullet to the cop's gun, the case is airtight."
445,00:27:40,00:27:42,There's a match.
446,00:27:43,00:27:45,We got Tyner.
447,00:27:45,00:27:47,One bad cop going down.
448,00:27:47,00:27:50,"Well, actually, Warrick, the evidence round wasn't from the cop's gun."
449,00:27:50,00:27:53,It was from the suspect's.
450,00:27:53,00:27:55,No way.
451,00:27:55,00:27:57,(hard rock music)
452,00:28:03,00:28:06,These guys never give up anything on their girls.
453,00:28:06,00:28:08,"Well, let me give it a try."
454,00:28:08,00:28:10,"Excuse me, sir."
455,00:28:10,00:28:11,Can we see your permits?
456,00:28:11,00:28:12,"Oh, hi, gorgeous."
457,00:28:12,00:28:13,How are you?
458,00:28:13,00:28:14,"Okay, Ted."
459,00:28:14,00:28:15,How are you doing?
460,00:28:15,00:28:16,I'm okay. Hi.
461,00:28:17,00:28:18,You should've seen this lady dance.
462,00:28:18,00:28:19,Was she good!
463,00:28:19,00:28:21,You still working with the cops?
464,00:28:21,00:28:24,Can't seem to get off the night shift.
465,00:28:24,00:28:25,You dressed like that?
466,00:28:25,00:28:27,If you want to call that dressed.
467,00:28:27,00:28:30,"Yeah, Evans."
468,00:28:30,00:28:35,"Hey, Ted, you heard about this thing with Eddie and April?"
469,00:28:35,00:28:38,"Yeah, the night guy told me about it."
470,00:28:38,00:28:40,"Boy, Eddie never changes, huh?"
471,00:28:48,00:28:50,Bring back memories?
472,00:28:53,00:28:56,You mind if I look around?
473,00:28:56,00:28:57,Help yourself.
474,00:28:57,00:28:59,"Thanks, Ted."
475,00:29:53,00:29:54,(doorbell rings)
476,00:29:54,00:29:56,Can I help you?
477,00:29:56,00:29:58,"Ma'am, my name is Gil Grissom. This is Nick Stokes."
478,00:29:58,00:30:00,"Honey, who's out there?"
479,00:30:00,00:30:05,"Mr. Hendler, we're criminalists from the Las Vegas Police Department."
480,00:30:05,00:30:06,What's this about?
481,00:30:06,00:30:10,We're investigating the disappearance of Fay Green.
482,00:30:10,00:30:11,May we come in?
483,00:30:13,00:30:15,Yes.
484,00:30:18,00:30:20,Thank you.
485,00:30:29,00:30:31,Did you find her?
486,00:30:31,00:30:33,"Yes, I'm afraid we did."
487,00:30:35,00:30:37,She'd been dead for quite a while.
488,00:30:37,00:30:39,Hmm.
489,00:30:42,00:30:44,You always hope...
490,00:30:46,00:30:48,Mr. Hendler?
491,00:30:48,00:30:50,Would it be possible for us to look around?
492,00:30:50,00:30:54,"Fay only lived here for about a month, five years ago."
493,00:30:56,00:30:58,I've got nothing to hide.
494,00:30:59,00:31:00,Thank you.
495,00:31:00,00:31:01,Thanks.
496,00:31:36,00:31:38,A trigger and a lionfish.
497,00:31:39,00:31:40,"Yeah, that's right."
498,00:31:40,00:31:42,Interesting choices.
499,00:31:42,00:31:46,"Violent, carnivorous predators."
500,00:31:49,00:31:52,(floor squeaks)
501,00:32:08,00:32:10,It's just a warped floorboard.
502,00:32:10,00:32:12,It's been like that forever.
503,00:32:12,00:32:17,"Mr. Hendler, at any time, was your fish tank over here?"
504,00:32:17,00:32:19,"Maybe, a while ago, why?"
505,00:32:19,00:32:21,Did it ever overflow?
506,00:32:21,00:32:23,Or break?
507,00:32:23,00:32:24,Not that I recall.
508,00:32:25,00:32:26,"You said I could look anywhere, right?"
509,00:32:27,00:32:29,Yeah.
510,00:32:29,00:32:31,Got a pocket knife?
511,00:32:38,00:32:39,What are you doing?
512,00:32:40,00:32:42,"Pops out, pops in."
513,00:32:52,00:32:54,What do you find inside an hourglass?
514,00:33:01,00:33:04,"Mr. Hendler, I think the tankwasover here."
515,00:33:04,00:33:06,I think it broke.
516,00:33:06,00:33:10,I think you got water and artificial sand all over the place.
517,00:33:10,00:33:13,"I'd like you fellows to leave now, please."
518,00:33:13,00:33:15,"Fine, we'll go."
519,00:33:15,00:33:16,We'll be back...
520,00:33:16,00:33:17,with a warrant.
521,00:33:26,00:33:27,So what did the rape kit say?
522,00:33:27,00:33:30,"Nonoxynol-9, polyvinyl alcohol, and..."
523,00:33:31,00:33:32,Glycerin?
524,00:33:32,00:33:34,Yeah.
525,00:33:34,00:33:36,It's a contraceptive film.
526,00:33:38,00:33:39,What are you drinking?
527,00:33:39,00:33:40,Chamomile.
528,00:33:40,00:33:41,May I? Sure.
529,00:33:41,00:33:43,Thank you.
530,00:33:44,00:33:47,"So you used to work at the French Palace, huh?"
531,00:33:47,00:33:49,That's right.
532,00:33:49,00:33:51,"You know, my friends and I used to go there. Really?"
533,00:33:51,00:33:53,Payday Fridays. Uh-huh.
534,00:33:53,00:33:55,Maybe I saw you perform?
535,00:33:55,00:33:56,"Oh, I doubt it."
536,00:33:56,00:33:57,Why?
537,00:33:57,00:34:00,You would've remembered.
538,00:34:02,00:34:07,"So, this film it's kind of hard to detect because it dissolves with body heat."
539,00:34:07,00:34:12,"And, as you know, Greg sex can make a body pretty hot."
540,00:34:13,00:34:17,This stuff has to be inserted 15 minutes to three hours before sex.
541,00:34:17,00:34:22,Which means that April inserted the film while she was still at work.
542,00:34:22,00:34:25,But how could she have known to put the birth control in before she was raped?
543,00:34:25,00:34:27,Exactly.
544,00:34:34,00:34:38,Guess where Jason Hendler was employed five years ago?
545,00:34:38,00:34:40,Summercliff housing development.
546,00:34:40,00:34:42,"A plumber, perhaps?"
547,00:34:42,00:34:44,Close. A subcontractor.
548,00:34:44,00:34:45,How'd you know?
549,00:34:45,00:34:47,Why else would you be so excited?
550,00:34:48,00:34:49,Hey!
551,00:34:49,00:34:52,You weren't going to say good-bye to me?
552,00:34:52,00:34:54,I'll meet you outside.
553,00:34:56,00:34:58,Thought I'd let you off easy.
554,00:34:58,00:35:03,But I did tack up my number on your big fish corkboard...
555,00:35:03,00:35:07,"Under ""cold cases."" The ones that got away."
556,00:35:07,00:35:08,Let's hope not.
557,00:35:15,00:35:17,"So, check it out..."
558,00:35:17,00:35:20,the laser is the path of the bullet.
559,00:35:22,00:35:27,If you were Officer Tyner and you approached the suspect from the driver's side of the vehicle...
560,00:35:27,00:35:30,Vic was shot in the frontal lobe through the windshield.
561,00:35:31,00:35:34,There's no way I could shoot the guy from here and mimic that trajectory.
562,00:35:34,00:35:36,The laws of physics trump the eyewitness.
563,00:35:37,00:35:38,There's only one way this could've gone down.
564,00:35:39,00:35:40,...show you my registration.
565,00:35:40,00:35:42,No! Put your hands on the wheel!
566,00:35:42,00:35:43,(gunshot)
567,00:35:43,00:35:45,Officer Tyner was telling the truth.
568,00:35:45,00:35:47,"So I bet you think I owe you one, huh?"
569,00:35:47,00:35:50,We work. We get paid.
570,00:35:50,00:35:51,You don't owe me anything.
571,00:35:51,00:35:54,Fine with me.
572,00:35:57,00:35:58,He promised me a million things.
573,00:35:58,00:35:59,I got tired of him lying.
574,00:35:59,00:36:01,"Like what, marriage, kids?"
575,00:36:01,00:36:02,Music videos.
576,00:36:02,00:36:05,He kept telling me he'd put me in one but he never delivered.
577,00:36:05,00:36:08,And for that you set him up for rape?
578,00:36:08,00:36:10,(sighs)
579,00:36:10,00:36:12,"No, it wasn't supposed to go this far, okay?"
580,00:36:12,00:36:13,I got this friend over at the Trop.
581,00:36:13,00:36:15,She got this high roller on a rape charge.
582,00:36:15,00:36:17,He paid a ton to make it go away.
583,00:36:18,00:36:21,Wait a minute. You think that Eddie's got money?
584,00:36:21,00:36:23,He is in the music business.
585,00:36:23,00:36:26,He reps some bands Off-Strip.
586,00:36:26,00:36:28,"No, I met a producer friend of his from L.A."
587,00:36:28,00:36:33,and he's always throwing money around this place.
588,00:36:33,00:36:36,(laughs)
589,00:36:36,00:36:38,What?
590,00:36:39,00:36:42,What's so funny?
591,00:36:42,00:36:43,Nothing.
592,00:36:51,00:36:55,I see you've cleaned house. I thought you might.
593,00:36:55,00:36:56,I vacuumed up the sand. Big deal.
594,00:36:56,00:36:58,Will you at least tell me what you're doing here?
595,00:36:59,00:37:01,"I'm working, sir."
596,00:37:01,00:37:03,"Officer, would you hit the lights, please?"
597,00:37:08,00:37:10,You're getting my floor wet.
598,00:37:10,00:37:13,"It's luminol, sir. It dries quickly."
599,00:37:16,00:37:18,Surface is non-reactive.
600,00:37:18,00:37:21,I know what you're doing. You're looking for blood.
601,00:37:21,00:37:23,My husband didn't do anything.
602,00:37:23,00:37:24,Why are you harassing him?
603,00:37:24,00:37:26,Let's try the ALS.
604,00:37:26,00:37:30,Why use the alternate light source if the luminol didn't pick up anything?
605,00:37:30,00:37:34,Luminol works on the surface ALS chases the protein molecules in blood.
606,00:37:34,00:37:36,It actually penetrates the wood.
607,00:37:36,00:37:38,These floorboards are all made of maple.
608,00:37:38,00:37:41,"High-end, but they've been lacquered."
609,00:37:43,00:37:47,Who lacquers maple unless they're trying to hide something?
610,00:38:06,00:38:08,"Turn it off, Nick."
611,00:38:09,00:38:11,"Officer, hit the lights, please."
612,00:38:12,00:38:17,Mr. Hendler let me tell you what I think happened to Fay.
613,00:38:17,00:38:20,On the night of her disappearance the two of you got in a heated argument.
614,00:38:20,00:38:22,Don't you walk away from me!
615,00:38:28,00:38:31,"Suffering a concussion, Fay falls to the floor."
616,00:38:31,00:38:34,In the heat of the moment you decide to make it final.
617,00:38:34,00:38:37,But Fay surprises you: she fights back.
618,00:38:37,00:38:41,She pushes you off. She crawls a few feet away and you move in for the final attack.
619,00:38:45,00:38:50,One thing that I don't know though what did you use to kill her?
620,00:38:50,00:38:52,I didn't kill her.
621,00:38:52,00:38:56,"Well, whatever the weapon it wasn't a knife, but it worked."
622,00:38:56,00:39:02,You drove her body over to Summercliff where you were employed and you buried her in wet concrete. I worked the Summercliff job less than a week.
623,00:39:02,00:39:04,Ask Amy; she worked for the same contractor.
624,00:39:04,00:39:07,That's right. He got a better job in Reno.
625,00:39:07,00:39:10,Jason wasn't even in Vegas when Fay disappeared.
626,00:39:10,00:39:14,"Yeah, you painted the floors, covered your tracks for what, aesthetic reasons?"
627,00:39:14,00:39:19,Five years is a long time but eventually the past catches up to everybody.
628,00:39:19,00:39:21,I didn't kill Fay!
629,00:39:21,00:39:23,I loved her. I still love her.
630,00:39:32,00:39:34,"Amy, I'm sorry."
631,00:39:34,00:39:36,I'm sorry.
632,00:39:36,00:39:40,You still love her?
633,00:39:42,00:39:46,"Officer, would you please arrest Mr. Hendler?"
634,00:39:50,00:39:52,Call my father. He'll get a lawyer.
635,00:39:58,00:40:00,I'll ride along with the cops.
636,00:40:00,00:40:02,Bring Homicide up to speed.
637,00:40:02,00:40:04,This is now a fresh crime scene.
638,00:40:04,00:40:05,I'll get to work.
639,00:40:28,00:40:43,"Grissom: ""...the instrument had to be slightly curved ""with some kind of serrated edge like crocodile teeth..."" Mrs. Hendler, do you and your husband do much rock climbing?"
640,00:40:43,00:40:45,(gun cocks) Yes.
641,00:40:45,00:40:47,That's what I killed her with.
642,00:40:49,00:40:52,I can prove I was in Reno when Fay disappeared.
643,00:40:52,00:40:55,I've got records.
644,00:40:55,00:40:57,"You don't want to talk, fine."
645,00:40:57,00:41:00,But I've got a question for you.
646,00:41:00,00:41:02,Why do you care so much about the floors?
647,00:41:02,00:41:04,"I mean, Amy paints them every spring."
648,00:41:04,00:41:06,It's no big deal.
649,00:41:12,00:41:15,Jason was in Reno.
650,00:41:15,00:41:23,I came here to tell Fay that we would be together again one day.
651,00:41:23,00:41:26,"Mrs. Hendler, put the gun down."
652,00:41:26,00:41:28,Do you know he was engaged to me when he met her?
653,00:41:28,00:41:30,Where are you going?
654,00:41:30,00:41:31,Stop it!
655,00:41:35,00:41:38,There was blood everywhere.
656,00:41:40,00:41:45,No one else could see it.
657,00:41:45,00:41:48,But I knew it was there.
658,00:41:51,00:41:54,A dead body is so heavy.
659,00:41:54,00:41:59,"Mrs. Hendler, I'm a good listener."
660,00:41:59,00:42:00,You've got to give me the gun.
661,00:42:00,00:42:03,I can't!
662,00:42:05,00:42:06,I'm sorry.
663,00:42:06,00:42:07,"No, wait."
664,00:42:08,00:42:09,But you arrested my husband.
665,00:42:09,00:42:10,Wait!
666,00:42:10,00:42:11,Mrs. Hendler.
667,00:42:11,00:42:12,"Nick, don't move."
668,00:42:12,00:42:15,Please.
669,00:42:15,00:42:17,I don't want to fire my gun any more than you do.
670,00:42:20,00:42:23,For five years you've been washing the blood off your hands.
671,00:42:26,00:42:29,Let's put down the guns.
672,00:42:49,00:42:51,"You okay, Nick?"
673,00:42:51,00:42:52,Yeah.
674,00:42:53,00:42:54,Come on.
675,00:43:21,00:43:22,Morning.
676,00:43:22,00:43:23,(bike bell rings)
677,00:43:24,00:43:26,Morning.
678,00:43:28,00:43:31,Please don't tell me that you're in trouble again already.
679,00:43:32,00:43:33,You weren't home. I figured you'd be here.
680,00:43:34,00:43:35,Lindsey loves this park.
681,00:43:37,00:43:39,"So, I thought I'd take you out to breakfast."
682,00:43:39,00:43:41,Say thank you.
683,00:43:41,00:43:42,You're welcome.
684,00:43:46,00:43:48,"I don't think that's such a good idea, though."
685,00:43:52,00:43:57,"Cath, when are we going to talk about what happened between us?"
686,00:43:57,00:44:01,What's to talk about?
687,00:44:01,00:44:03,You cheated on me.
688,00:44:03,00:44:06,I caught you.
689,00:44:06,00:44:08,I've got a new life.
690,00:44:11,00:44:13,Cath...
691,00:44:13,00:44:18,Come on...
692,00:44:18,00:44:21,why do you fight the one thing we're good at?
693,00:44:22,00:44:24,Daddy!
694,00:44:24,00:44:25,Daddy!
695,00:44:28,00:44:30,There's my little girl.
