0,00:00:23,00:00:25,"ANNOUNCER: All right, Oklahoma has a ten-point lead."
1,00:00:25,00:00:27,Isaac got it to Hendricks.
2,00:00:28,00:00:30,He shoots. He scores.
3,00:00:30,00:00:31,(elevator dings)
4,00:01:04,00:01:05,(screams)
5,00:01:05,00:01:07,Give me your keys and get in the car.
6,00:01:21,00:01:23,What is that?
7,00:01:28,00:01:30,Is that a body?
8,00:01:39,00:01:41,"Oh, my God, she's alive."
9,00:01:42,00:01:44,(siren blares)
10,00:01:54,00:01:56,Here's what I know so far.
11,00:01:56,00:01:59,"Victim was a well-dressed woman, young, black."
12,00:01:59,00:02:05,She's at Desert Palm Hospital multiple gunshots to the head possible sexual assault.
13,00:02:05,00:02:10,"Doctor has her as ""death imminent."" Sara, go to the hospital and process the victim."
14,00:02:10,00:02:12,"Sexual assault kit, hairs, fibers, the works."
15,00:02:12,00:02:13,Right now?
16,00:02:13,00:02:15,I thought I would help you two with the scene.
17,00:02:15,00:02:18,The evidence won't stay on the body long at the E.R.
18,00:02:18,00:02:22,"Walk in the park, guys."
19,00:02:32,00:02:34,It looks like a high heel print.
20,00:02:34,00:02:37,Maybe abducted.
21,00:02:37,00:02:40,Did she know the guy?
22,00:02:40,00:02:41,Did he use his car or hers?
23,00:02:42,00:02:48,Locard's Principle: he took a piece of her away with him and he left a piece of himself here.
24,00:02:48,00:02:50,We get to find it.
25,00:03:29,00:03:31,"Thank you, my Sherpas."
26,00:03:31,00:03:32,Surely.
27,00:03:33,00:03:34,(box thuds)
28,00:03:34,00:03:37,"So, you got our assignments?"
29,00:03:37,00:03:38,You're looking at it.
30,00:03:38,00:03:40,Murder case.
31,00:03:40,00:03:41,This mess?
32,00:03:41,00:03:42,You're not serious.
33,00:03:43,00:03:44,D.A. is.
34,00:03:44,00:03:47,Guy named McCall shot and killed his neighbor over a motorcycle.
35,00:03:47,00:03:50,D.A. can't make heads or tails of the evidence for the preliminary hearing.
36,00:03:51,00:03:53,Where's McCall now? He's being held?
37,00:03:53,00:03:56,He ran from the arresting officers so the judge refused him bail.
38,00:03:56,00:03:58,And why isn't the case CSI dealing with this?
39,00:03:58,00:03:59,Franovich from days?
40,00:03:59,00:04:00,He quit yesterday.
41,00:04:01,00:04:03,Burnout.
42,00:04:05,00:04:06,And what did the D.A. charge?
43,00:04:06,00:04:07,Murder one.
44,00:04:07,00:04:11,The case has changed hands so many times that the D.A. can't make any sense of it.
45,00:04:11,00:04:12,It gets better.
46,00:04:13,00:04:14,The prelim's in four days.
47,00:04:14,00:04:16,"Well, no pressure here."
48,00:04:17,00:04:19,Great.
49,00:04:19,00:04:20,"Cath, can I see you outside for a sec?"
50,00:04:25,00:04:28,WILLOWS: Why would my bank be asking you about my employment record?
51,00:04:28,00:04:30,"Well, technically, I'm your supervisor."
52,00:04:30,00:04:33,They said Eddie took a second mortgage out on your house.
53,00:04:33,00:04:37,They said that you still own it together until the divorce is final.
54,00:04:40,00:04:45,We didn't want to sell it until the market went back up then we'd split the profits.
55,00:04:45,00:04:47,I can't believe he took a second out on the house.
56,00:04:47,00:04:48,How could he without my signature?
57,00:04:48,00:04:50,It's Eddie.
58,00:04:50,00:04:52,I just thought you should know.
59,00:04:52,00:04:54,I gotta get back out to Nick.
60,00:05:04,00:05:05,Hey.
61,00:05:05,00:05:06,Hey.
62,00:05:07,00:05:09,You get any ID on her?
63,00:05:09,00:05:10,"No, she's a Jane Doe."
64,00:05:10,00:05:12,She's got two bullets lodged in her brain.
65,00:05:12,00:05:14,Docs can't remove them without killing her.
66,00:05:14,00:05:15,All right.
67,00:05:15,00:05:16,Hi.
68,00:05:20,00:05:21,Thanks.
69,00:05:27,00:05:31,Make a note she's married.
70,00:05:31,00:05:32,Or recently divorced.
71,00:05:38,00:05:41,She's warm.
72,00:05:41,00:05:43,"Feels different, huh?"
73,00:05:48,00:05:49,"Uh, Evans..."
74,00:05:51,00:05:53,We're going to need a little privacy here.
75,00:07:13,00:07:16,I never really liked this part of my yearly exam.
76,00:07:16,00:07:18,These things are always freezing.
77,00:07:25,00:07:26,Okay.
78,00:07:45,00:07:50,Cartridge casings.
79,00:07:50,00:07:51,"They don't look like hunters', either."
80,00:07:59,00:08:02,"Nick, get a shot of this."
81,00:08:05,00:08:08,Looks like a belt loop.
82,00:08:08,00:08:10,"Well, it couldn't have been there long."
83,00:08:10,00:08:11,No elements.
84,00:08:11,00:08:13,"GRISSOM: Brass, was the victim wearing denim?"
85,00:08:13,00:08:15,"Silk or lace, something like that."
86,00:08:15,00:08:17,Definitely not denim.
87,00:08:17,00:08:19,Good chance this is our suspect.
88,00:08:19,00:08:21,I'm going to use scent pads.
89,00:08:24,00:08:25,Scent pads?
90,00:08:25,00:08:26,Canine voodoo.
91,00:08:26,00:08:30,A dog's sense of smell is about 40 times more acute than a human's.
92,00:08:30,00:08:35,A dog's nose is packed with dense rolls of membranes that absorb odor.
93,00:08:35,00:08:39,"Stretched out, these membranes extend about a third the length of a dog's body."
94,00:08:39,00:08:42,The membranes of the human nose about the size of a postage stamp.
95,00:08:42,00:08:46,Looks like a giant Dustbuster.
96,00:08:46,00:08:47,Similar.
97,00:08:47,00:08:53,You place absorbent pads into the chamber then run the machine over the suspected item.
98,00:08:53,00:08:57,Then you take the pad seal it in an envelope and freeze it.
99,00:08:58,00:09:04,"Yeah. Yeah, then we pull them out when we know enough about this denim guy to find a proximal location."
100,00:09:04,00:09:07,Except there's a caveat.
101,00:09:07,00:09:09,You want to explain that caveat?
102,00:09:10,00:09:13,Later.
103,00:09:13,00:09:16,"Hopefully, Sara's making some progress."
104,00:09:16,00:09:20,"Hey, are you just going to ignore my question?"
105,00:09:21,00:09:23,I called Eddie about the loan. I got his voicemail.
106,00:09:23,00:09:25,The guy's like ether.
107,00:09:26,00:09:28,You going to answer my question?
108,00:09:28,00:09:40,"All right, here's what we know from the arresting officer: Two 25-year-old guys Chuckie Hastings and Roy McCall, lifelong neighbors one step up from a trailer park got into a beef over a motorcycle in the owner's backyard."
109,00:09:41,00:09:42,"All right, here's McCall's statement."
110,00:09:42,00:09:44,If you can believe a guy who's looking at murder.
111,00:09:44,00:09:50,McCall says that he returned Hastings' motorcycle to him with the front end smashed up.
112,00:09:50,00:09:52,They were standing in Hastings' back yard...
113,00:09:52,00:09:53,I told you I'd pay for it.
114,00:09:53,00:09:55,"Yeah, you said that last time."
115,00:09:55,00:09:56,Whatever.
116,00:09:56,00:09:59,"Yeah, whatever you bastard."
117,00:09:59,00:10:01,"Hey, back off, man, back off."
118,00:10:01,00:10:02,You're going to pay for all of it.
119,00:10:02,00:10:07,WILLOWS: McCall defends himself with an automatic that was down his pants.
120,00:10:12,00:10:16,"All right, now, Hastings' wife said that McCall shot Hastings in the back."
121,00:10:16,00:10:17,Mm-hmm.
122,00:10:17,00:10:20,And the coroner's report substantiates that.
123,00:10:22,00:10:23,(screams)
124,00:10:23,00:10:28,"So what, McCall lied, said Hastings went after him with a screwdriver so he could plead self-defense?"
125,00:10:28,00:10:32,"Well, we would need the screwdriver with McCall's blood on it to prove that now, wouldn't we?"
126,00:10:32,00:10:35,"All right, which box?"
127,00:10:35,00:10:38,I have been through all these boxes twice.
128,00:10:38,00:10:40,It's not there.
129,00:10:40,00:10:42,The evidence is lost?
130,00:10:42,00:10:44,In a murder case?
131,00:10:44,00:10:46,"The gun is here, but there's no screwdriver."
132,00:10:46,00:10:48,They even have crime scene photos of it.
133,00:10:48,00:10:51,But no tests were run on it before it was misplaced.
134,00:10:51,00:10:53,"So, we know why Franovich left."
135,00:10:53,00:10:55,He quit before we could fire his ass.
136,00:10:55,00:10:56,Right.
137,00:10:56,00:10:58,"So, you know who the D.A. will blame for this?"
138,00:10:58,00:11:00,"Yeah, the same people Homicide'll blame."
139,00:11:00,00:11:04,"Well, now that we've exhausted all of our options let's start over."
140,00:11:06,00:11:09,So this lady's expected to die. Is that the story?
141,00:11:09,00:11:11,"Somebody raped her, shot her and left her for dead."
142,00:11:11,00:11:15,And left two cartridge casings behind for us.
143,00:11:15,00:11:16,Thank you very much.
144,00:11:22,00:11:24,That kind of oversight tells you he's stupid.
145,00:11:24,00:11:26,Or true to form.
146,00:11:26,00:11:30,People are usually meticulous in planning up to a murder they rarely plan the aftermath.
147,00:11:30,00:11:35,"Still, you'd think the bad guys would figure we'd eventually start a data base on cartridge casings, huh?"
148,00:11:35,00:11:37,(computer buzzes)
149,00:11:38,00:11:41,"Gentlemen, we've got ourselves a bull's-eye."
150,00:11:43,00:11:44,"STOKES: Well, well, well."
151,00:11:44,00:11:48,Looks like this gun was used before in a case we've handled.
152,00:11:48,00:11:51,North Vegas.
153,00:11:51,00:11:53,And I gotta do a side-by-side comparison to be sure.
154,00:11:53,00:11:55,"Well, listen, if you get a confirmation, page me."
155,00:11:55,00:11:57,I gotta go see Sara.
156,00:11:57,00:11:58,Okay.
157,00:12:07,00:12:09,(clink)
158,00:12:21,00:12:23,Saint Catherine.
159,00:12:23,00:12:25,She studied science.
160,00:12:28,00:12:34,She was tough and very outspoken.
161,00:12:34,00:12:37,Went against the Emperor himself.
162,00:12:37,00:12:40,Chewed him out for persecuting Christians.
163,00:12:40,00:12:47,Took him two or three tries to execute her.
164,00:12:47,00:12:50,She never gave up. She was brave.
165,00:12:59,00:13:01,You hold on to this.
166,00:13:14,00:13:18,This shouldn't have happened to you.
167,00:13:18,00:13:25,"But, I promise I will find out who did this."
168,00:13:25,00:13:26,I promise.
169,00:13:32,00:13:33,Hey.
170,00:13:33,00:13:34,Hey.
171,00:13:38,00:13:41,Sexual assault kit's ready to process.
172,00:13:41,00:13:43,How's it look?
173,00:13:43,00:13:46,We'll see.
174,00:13:46,00:13:49,"She's, um..."
175,00:13:49,00:13:51,breathing.
176,00:13:51,00:13:53,She's evidence.
177,00:13:55,00:13:56,Sara?
178,00:13:56,00:13:58,Yeah?
179,00:13:58,00:14:02,If you try and chase two rabbits you end up losing them both.
180,00:14:16,00:14:19,(barking)
181,00:14:30,00:14:32,(knocking)
182,00:14:33,00:14:34,Hi.
183,00:14:34,00:14:36,Lauriane Hastings?
184,00:14:36,00:14:39,We're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
185,00:14:39,00:14:40,Cops.
186,00:14:40,00:14:41,I have talked to enough of you already.
187,00:14:41,00:14:43,"BROWN: Ma'am, we're not cops."
188,00:14:43,00:14:44,We're crime scene investigators.
189,00:14:44,00:14:48,We've come to ask you a few questions about the day that your husband was killed.
190,00:14:48,00:14:51,Maybe acquaint ourselves with the actual crime scene.
191,00:14:51,00:14:54,Is this going to let Roy McCall out of jail which is where he belongs?
192,00:14:54,00:14:57,We're simply reviewing the evidence for the preliminary hearing.
193,00:15:02,00:15:07,McCall was always borrowing this motorcycle and Chuckie was mad at him 'cause he returned it wrecked again.
194,00:15:07,00:15:10,He was yelling at him and out of the blue McCall pulled his gun.
195,00:15:10,00:15:12,You were home.
196,00:15:12,00:15:13,"Yes, I was."
197,00:15:13,00:15:14,And you saw the shooting?
198,00:15:14,00:15:16,I most certainly did.
199,00:15:16,00:15:18,I was doing laundry here...
200,00:15:18,00:15:19,McCALL: Get your hands off me.
201,00:15:19,00:15:20,"CHUCKIE: I'm sick of you, man."
202,00:15:20,00:15:22,McCALL: Whatever.
203,00:15:22,00:15:25,LAURIANE: I went to see and try to break it up.
204,00:15:25,00:15:27,"CHUCKIE: Back off, man. Back off."
205,00:15:27,00:15:28,Get your sorry ass off my property.
206,00:15:29,00:15:31,(gunshots)
207,00:15:36,00:15:37,(screaming)
208,00:15:39,00:15:40,Out back here?
209,00:15:40,00:15:42,Yes.
210,00:15:50,00:15:55,How long did you say they had been arguing before you heard the first shot?
211,00:15:55,00:15:58,Couple minutes.
212,00:15:58,00:16:00,And then you went out back?
213,00:16:00,00:16:02,That's right.
214,00:16:04,00:16:06,"Okay, thank you."
215,00:16:06,00:16:08,This won't take very long.
216,00:16:08,00:16:09,(timer beeps)
217,00:16:12,00:16:14,What's up?
218,00:16:14,00:16:16,"She did a ""fill-in"" back there in the garage."
219,00:16:16,00:16:22,"First, she said she saw both shots, but I just asked her and she said she heard the first shot and then came running out here."
220,00:16:22,00:16:24,Heard the first shot and then came running out here.
221,00:16:25,00:16:26,Yeah.
222,00:16:26,00:16:27,McCall had a semiautomatic.
223,00:16:28,00:16:30,"I mean, you could pull off a shot in two-tenths of a second."
224,00:16:30,00:16:31,Right.
225,00:16:31,00:16:33,It took me 3.8 seconds to get out here.
226,00:16:34,00:16:35,She didn't see any shot.
227,00:16:35,00:16:39,So she just filled in what she thought happened-- that McCall shot her husband in cold blood.
228,00:16:40,00:16:41,Right.
229,00:16:41,00:16:42,Typical eyewitness.
230,00:16:42,00:16:47,"So, there's a good chance that McCall was telling the truth that he shot Hastings in self-defense."
231,00:16:47,00:16:51,"Well, if we had the screwdriver that someone lost we'd be able to check for blood."
232,00:16:51,00:16:52,Right.
233,00:16:52,00:16:53,Let's go see McCall.
234,00:16:53,00:16:55,No one lost him.
235,00:16:55,00:16:56,All right.
236,00:17:00,00:17:03,"Hey, you guys, this North Vegas shooting with the same casings as our Jane Doe's?"
237,00:17:03,00:17:04,Mm-hmm.
238,00:17:04,00:17:06,It was gang-related.
239,00:17:06,00:17:08,And Homicide never found the shooter.
240,00:17:08,00:17:10,It's almost impossible in gang neighborhoods.
241,00:17:11,00:17:11,Nobody wants to talk.
242,00:17:12,00:17:14,People are afraid.
243,00:17:14,00:17:18,"Listen, let's see if we have any evidence that's not attributed to the victim."
244,00:17:19,00:17:21,(paper bag rustling)
245,00:17:21,00:17:22,Here you go.
246,00:17:28,00:17:30,GRISSOM: Snakebacks.
247,00:17:30,00:17:35,Gang shooters mark their kills by tossing down their hats.
248,00:17:40,00:17:43,Some sort of anthropological quirk of territoriality.
249,00:17:43,00:17:46,Like cats spraying on a bush.
250,00:17:46,00:17:48,Lets the opposition know who was responsible.
251,00:17:48,00:17:50,Somebody wore this hat a lot.
252,00:17:55,00:18:01,This sweatband might give us DNA and I could compare it to the samples I collected off of Jane at the hospital.
253,00:18:03,00:18:04,Jane?
254,00:18:06,00:18:08,Our... Jane Doe.
255,00:18:08,00:18:11,"My ""death imminent."" First-name basis, Sara?"
256,00:18:12,00:18:15,I'll be in DNA.
257,00:18:25,00:18:26,Hey.
258,00:18:26,00:18:29,"This is, uh, Detective Sam Vega from the Gang Detail."
259,00:18:29,00:18:31,He's here to give us information on 23rd Street.
260,00:18:31,00:18:33,This is Gil Grissom and Nick Stokes from the Crime Lab.
261,00:18:33,00:18:34,We're looking for a shooter.
262,00:18:35,00:18:37,"Guy abducted, raped and shot a young black woman the other night."
263,00:18:38,00:18:42,"We get a couple of shootings a week here from the Snakebacks, out of a four-block radius from this point here."
264,00:18:42,00:18:44,Usually at the Pepper Street Gang.
265,00:18:44,00:18:47,Your guy might have left the neighborhood as part of a gang initiation.
266,00:18:47,00:18:49,It means more when the victim's a civilian.
267,00:18:49,00:18:52,STOKES: Our ball cap belongs to somebody in this neighborhood.
268,00:18:52,00:18:55,These houses are full of people who know the guy who wears it.
269,00:18:55,00:18:58,"Okay, Nick, ready to burn some shoe leather?"
270,00:18:58,00:19:00,"Some old-fashioned police work, what do you say, huh?"
271,00:19:00,00:19:02,Why can't we just use those scent pads?
272,00:19:02,00:19:03,The dogs?
273,00:19:04,00:19:05,Constitutional issue.
274,00:19:05,00:19:08,We can't get a warrant for the evidence we find off the dogs' search.
275,00:19:08,00:19:11,"Great, great."
276,00:19:11,00:19:12,Why'd you even suggest it?
277,00:19:13,00:19:14,"You're a grown man, Nick."
278,00:19:14,00:19:15,Stop whining.
279,00:19:21,00:19:26,"BROWN: Mr. McCall, according to your statement you went over to your neighbor Hastings' house to return his motorcycle."
280,00:19:26,00:19:30,You got into a dispute over a wrecked fender and he attacked you with a screwdriver.
281,00:19:30,00:19:32,He stabbed me in the arm.
282,00:19:32,00:19:33,"Hey, back off, man."
283,00:19:35,00:19:36,(groans)
284,00:19:36,00:19:40,Can you circle the area in which the screwdriver entered your arm when Hastings attacked you?
285,00:19:47,00:19:48,May I exam your client's wound?
286,00:19:50,00:19:52,"Yes, anything to clear my client."
287,00:20:00,00:20:01,Thanks.
288,00:20:05,00:20:07,I think he's telling the truth.
289,00:20:07,00:20:08,He's right-handed.
290,00:20:09,00:20:11,I could tell when he took the pen.
291,00:20:11,00:20:15,So you're saying that if he'd inflicted the wound on himself he would have stabbed his left arm.
292,00:20:15,00:20:21,"And even if he'd tried to fool us and stabbed his right arm the entry scar would have been upward, not down."
293,00:20:21,00:20:25,"Mr. McCall, which direction was Hastings facing when you shot him?"
294,00:20:25,00:20:26,He was facing my client.
295,00:20:26,00:20:27,End of story.
296,00:20:27,00:20:29,"Well, the coroner disagrees."
297,00:20:29,00:20:31,"Well, that's the coroner's problem."
298,00:20:31,00:20:40,"And I after I tell any jury how your side managed to lose a piece of evidence as important as the screwdriver really, how much weight will the Coroner's findings have?"
299,00:20:42,00:20:45,People don't realize just how many sets of hands a piece of evidence passes through.
300,00:20:45,00:20:47,Losing evidence isn't about anything sneaky.
301,00:20:47,00:20:48,It's just human error.
302,00:20:48,00:20:52,"Yeah, defense attorneys have made a whole career off that human error."
303,00:20:52,00:20:53,"Yeah, tell me about it."
304,00:20:53,00:20:55,(phone rings)
305,00:20:55,00:20:56,Hello.
306,00:20:57,00:20:58,Eddie...
307,00:20:58,00:21:00,I-I'll meet you at the coroner's.
308,00:21:00,00:21:05,"So, you took a second out on the house and, uh, didn't tell me about it?"
309,00:21:05,00:21:08,"No, I would have remembered you telling me something as big as..."
310,00:21:08,00:21:10,"Oh, a studio."
311,00:21:10,00:21:11,Are you out of your mind?
312,00:21:11,00:21:17,"So, now I'm going to be making house payments which you never had money for when we lived together anda second mortgage?"
313,00:21:17,00:21:18,"No, we don't have time to talk about this."
314,00:21:18,00:21:22,"You get that loaned canceled, and you do it now, Ed."
315,00:21:22,00:21:23,Now!
316,00:21:23,00:21:25,(sighs)
317,00:21:27,00:21:29,"Doc, are you sure McCall shot Hastings in the back?"
318,00:21:29,00:21:31,"Back to front, both times."
319,00:21:31,00:21:34,This guy McCall swears that he shot him straight ahead in self-defense.
320,00:21:35,00:21:36,Look at my notes.
321,00:21:40,00:21:41,Right here.
322,00:21:43,00:21:53,"""Entry wounds ""piercing the back, both small, regular ""with evidence of carbonaceous material typical of having just emerged from a gun..."" Right."
323,00:21:53,00:21:56,"""...and they exited out the front ""with a classic keyhole effect-- irregular."
324,00:21:56,00:22:05,"""First bullet entered Hastings' ""lattissimus dorsi ""passed through the lower intestine ""exited out the intercostal muscle."
325,00:22:07,00:22:18,"""The second bullet ""passed through Hastings' C-7 thoracic nerve exited out the pectoralis major."" All right, look, I'm not doubting your findings."
326,00:22:18,00:22:21,"But when guys go at it they're not like gingerbread men, you know?"
327,00:22:21,00:22:23,"They're, like, bobbing and weaving."
328,00:22:23,00:22:25,It's like W.W.F. Smackdown.
329,00:22:25,00:22:27,You know?
330,00:22:27,00:22:31,All of these things could have changed what went down when Hastings and McCall tangled.
331,00:22:31,00:22:33,"Anatomically speaking, it's open-and-shut."
332,00:22:33,00:22:35,You guys are the ones to put perspective on it.
333,00:22:36,00:22:36,No doubt.
334,00:22:37,00:22:41,When Catherine gets here can you tell her I went over to Evidence to check out the victim's T-shirt?
335,00:22:41,00:22:42,Mm-hmm.
336,00:22:43,00:22:48,(humming softly)
337,00:22:55,00:22:57,(continues humming)
338,00:22:57,00:22:59,(singing softly)
339,00:23:04,00:23:07,Hey.
340,00:23:07,00:23:09,Any luck on 23rd Street?
341,00:23:09,00:23:11,"I, uh, broke in my new shoes."
342,00:23:11,00:23:13,That's about it.
343,00:23:13,00:23:14,What'd the lab say?
344,00:23:14,00:23:18,The DNA from the ball cap is a match to the semen we found on our Jane Doe.
345,00:23:18,00:23:22,But... CODIS hasn't kicked out a name.
346,00:23:22,00:23:26,"So, you're just... looking at Missing Persons reports?"
347,00:23:26,00:23:36,We're not having any luck finding the shooter from his DNA with a belt loop so I thought I would at least try and identify the poor woman before she dies.
348,00:23:43,00:23:46,Sara.
349,00:23:46,00:23:48,Do you have any diversions?
350,00:23:48,00:23:49,Do I what?
351,00:23:49,00:23:53,You max out on overtime every month.
352,00:23:53,00:23:55,You go home and listen to your police scanner.
353,00:23:55,00:23:57,You read forensic textbooks...
354,00:23:57,00:23:58,Yeah.
355,00:24:02,00:24:07,"Look, every day we meet people on the worst day of their lives."
356,00:24:07,00:24:09,It's a lot to deal with.
357,00:24:09,00:24:16,Everyone who's had any time on this job knows that you have to have a diversion in order to cope with what we see.
358,00:24:16,00:24:19,What do you do for fun?
359,00:24:19,00:24:21,I chase rabbits.
360,00:24:24,00:24:25,And...
361,00:24:25,00:24:28,I read crime books.
362,00:24:28,00:24:30,And I listen to the scanner.
363,00:24:30,00:24:33,You need something outside of law enforcement.
364,00:24:33,00:24:36,"Catherine has her kid, you know?"
365,00:24:36,00:24:39,I sometimes...
366,00:24:39,00:24:41,ride roller coasters.
367,00:24:42,00:24:46,What do you do?
368,00:24:46,00:24:47,Nothing.
369,00:24:47,00:24:49,Okay.
370,00:24:49,00:24:51,What do you like?
371,00:24:51,00:24:52,I don't like anything.
372,00:24:55,00:24:56,You've got to find something to like.
373,00:24:56,00:24:58,You can't get too close to the victims.
374,00:24:58,00:25:02,She's special... to me.
375,00:25:02,00:25:04,I can't help it.
376,00:25:05,00:25:08,If you don't find something they'll all become special and you'll burn out.
377,00:25:20,00:25:22,Sara.
378,00:25:22,00:25:23,Okay.
379,00:25:23,00:25:24,I'm almost done.
380,00:25:24,00:25:26,I just got to log off.
381,00:25:48,00:25:50,"So, this is progress."
382,00:25:50,00:25:55,The shirt confirms what the coroner said: the shots were fired back to front.
383,00:25:55,00:25:57,Look at those entry holes.
384,00:26:00,00:26:01,"Yeah, but look at that gunpowder."
385,00:26:04,00:26:05,Unburned gunpowder.
386,00:26:05,00:26:08,Which happens when a gun is fired less than three feet from a victim.
387,00:26:08,00:26:10,Right.
388,00:26:11,00:26:16,McCall says that they were standing five paces apart.
389,00:26:16,00:26:19,Mrs. Hastings says the exact same thing.
390,00:26:19,00:26:23,"So, we got two eyewitnesses on opposite sides of the case..."
391,00:26:23,00:26:24,saying the same thing.
392,00:26:24,00:26:26,In direct contradiction to our evidence.
393,00:26:26,00:26:27,"Well, the DA's on my beeper."
394,00:26:27,00:26:31,"Would you, uh, explain this to him because I can't."
395,00:26:31,00:26:32,"Yeah, right."
396,00:26:32,00:26:33,Hey...
397,00:26:33,00:26:37,when's the last time you took target practice?
398,00:26:37,00:26:40,Figures. I just had a manicure.
399,00:26:40,00:26:49,"Okay, so we're doing this reconstruction and the best way is to measure the distance between the victim and the assailant during the time of the altercation, right?"
400,00:26:49,00:26:51,Right.
401,00:26:51,00:26:52,(snaps chamber shut)
402,00:26:52,00:26:57,Using the same firearm and ammo that McCall used in his backyard on Hastings.
403,00:26:57,00:26:59,Right.
404,00:27:39,00:27:42,BROWN: Circumference of the gunpowder is the same.
405,00:27:42,00:27:45,Looks like two feet for shot number one...
406,00:27:50,00:27:53,...and one foot for shot number two.
407,00:27:53,00:27:56,And according to Lauriane Hastings' statement he was running away.
408,00:27:56,00:27:58,How can the second shot be closer than the first?
409,00:27:58,00:28:00,It can't. It's not possible.
410,00:28:02,00:28:04,We just disproved their statement.
411,00:28:04,00:28:06,And then we've got McCall's statement.
412,00:28:08,00:28:11,Can't happen when someone's facing you.
413,00:28:11,00:28:13,(sighs)
414,00:28:13,00:28:16,The truth is somewhere in the middle.
415,00:28:16,00:28:18,How long do we have till the prelim?
416,00:28:18,00:28:20,I think I know how we can figure this out.
417,00:28:20,00:28:22,I saw this thing in my forensics catalog.
418,00:28:23,00:28:24,"What kind of ""thing""?"
419,00:28:25,00:28:28,STOKES: Now youwantto use the dogs to track down the Jane Doe shooter?
420,00:28:28,00:28:30,K-9 unit's going to meet us there.
421,00:28:30,00:28:31,"Yeah, but I spoke to Brass."
422,00:28:31,00:28:35,"He said we can't get a warrant on anything we need from the suspect's house-- gun, jeans, nothing."
423,00:28:35,00:28:37,That's if we find him inside his house.
424,00:28:37,00:28:40,"In which case, we'll figure out another way to get a warrant."
425,00:28:40,00:28:42,You're rushing this for Sarah.
426,00:28:42,00:28:43,"My priority is the case, Nick."
427,00:28:43,00:28:46,Release the hounds.
428,00:29:13,00:29:16,You were shopping.
429,00:29:18,00:29:20,Pamela...
430,00:29:20,00:29:22,Pamela Adler.
431,00:29:22,00:29:24,(barking)
432,00:29:34,00:29:36,"Hey, Lady."
433,00:29:37,00:29:40,My belt loop set pads.
434,00:29:46,00:29:47,(barking)
435,00:29:49,00:29:53,Whoa! Are we supposed to be able to keep up with those guys?
436,00:29:53,00:29:55,Yeah!
437,00:30:28,00:30:31,(barking)
438,00:30:33,00:30:35,"Hey, hey, yo, yo."
439,00:30:35,00:30:37,"Back off, Snoop."
440,00:30:37,00:30:39,What you raggedy mutts want with me anyway?
441,00:30:39,00:30:41,"Hey, you two, don't be hassling me."
442,00:30:42,00:30:44,(footsteps approaching)
443,00:30:44,00:30:47,Guy's wearing the evidence in plain sight.
444,00:30:47,00:30:49,We just got lucky.
445,00:30:49,00:30:50,WOMAN: Tony!
446,00:30:50,00:30:52,What are you doing?!
447,00:30:52,00:30:53,You got a problem?
448,00:30:53,00:30:55,"Ma'am, is-is this your son?"
449,00:30:55,00:30:58,"Yes. Well, we're going to have to talk to him for a minute."
450,00:30:58,00:31:01,You police-- coming here with your attack dogs.
451,00:31:01,00:31:03,"Actually, they're scent dogs, and I'm not a police officer."
452,00:31:03,00:31:06,I'm a forensics scientist with the Las Vegas Police Department.
453,00:31:06,00:31:08,What do I got to say to a scientist?
454,00:31:08,00:31:16,"You could say ""hello."" This dummy cost over $500?"
455,00:31:16,00:31:17,"Oh, yeah."
456,00:31:17,00:31:18,He's worth it.
457,00:31:18,00:31:19,Why?
458,00:31:19,00:31:21,"Well, look at him."
459,00:31:21,00:31:26,"He's lifelike, he doesn't talk, and he's self-healing."
460,00:31:26,00:31:27,"He's ""self-healing""?"
461,00:31:27,00:31:28,Yeah.
462,00:31:28,00:31:32,We make a mistake in our calculations we just start over.
463,00:31:32,00:31:34,Cool.
464,00:31:34,00:31:36,"Um, the wound track is off."
465,00:31:36,00:31:38,Do it two centimeters higher.
466,00:31:39,00:31:43,All right.
467,00:31:43,00:31:44,How's that?
468,00:31:44,00:31:46,Good. All right.
469,00:31:46,00:31:51,"Now, the second shot was fired like so."
470,00:31:51,00:31:59,"And the coroner says that Hastings was shot just like this, from back to front and Hastings' wife says the same thing-- that her husband was running away."
471,00:31:59,00:32:09,And McCall says that Hastings was facing him shot him in self-defense and he's got the wound...
472,00:32:09,00:32:10,to prove it.
473,00:32:10,00:32:15,"Just like I said before, guys don't go at it and fight like gingerbread men, you know?"
474,00:32:15,00:32:16,Mm-hmm.
475,00:32:16,00:32:17,Check it out.
476,00:32:19,00:32:21,"What if, um..."
477,00:32:21,00:32:24,he was lunged...
478,00:32:25,00:32:28,...just kind of like this?
479,00:32:29,00:32:33,"Oh, you are wrong!"
480,00:32:33,00:32:34,(chuckling)
481,00:32:39,00:32:43,Warrick I think maybe they were both telling the truth.
482,00:32:43,00:32:45,Yeah.
483,00:32:45,00:32:48,I'm calling the DA.
484,00:32:55,00:32:58,"So, Tony, where were you two nights ago?"
485,00:32:58,00:32:59,I was nowhere special.
486,00:32:59,00:33:00,I was just hanging.
487,00:33:00,00:33:03,"Grissom told you to keep me out, didn't he?"
488,00:33:03,00:33:05,Yeah.
489,00:33:05,00:33:07,Were you wearing those pants the other night?
490,00:33:07,00:33:08,"Oh, these jeans?"
491,00:33:08,00:33:10,What's it to you?
492,00:33:10,00:33:12,They're missing a belt loop.
493,00:33:13,00:33:15,I find that interesting.
494,00:33:15,00:33:16,BRASS: You mind if we look at those?
495,00:33:16,00:33:18,We got some scrubs for you to wear.
496,00:33:18,00:33:21,He doesn't have to do anything unless a judge says to.
497,00:33:21,00:33:24,That's why we're asking Tony to volunteer.
498,00:33:24,00:33:25,GRISSOM: With your permission...
499,00:33:25,00:33:27,"Chill, Moms."
500,00:33:27,00:33:29,I got nothing to hide.
501,00:33:29,00:33:30,It's no big thing.
502,00:33:30,00:33:33,Cop said lady isn't even dead.
503,00:33:33,00:33:36,"That's true, she isn't..."
504,00:33:36,00:33:40,but if she dies within a year and a day of the shooting...
505,00:33:40,00:33:41,then it's murder.
506,00:33:42,00:33:43,SHAUNDA: Is this some kind of trick?
507,00:33:43,00:33:45,"No, ma'am, it's the law."
508,00:33:45,00:33:47,We're working this case as a murder.
509,00:33:47,00:33:51,"At least for the next year and a day and even then, I'm still a juvie."
510,00:33:53,00:33:56,"Well, then I guess the law is on your side, Tony, isn't it?"
511,00:33:56,00:33:57,For now.
512,00:33:59,00:34:01,(mumbling)
513,00:34:02,00:34:04,"ED: Hi, Catherine."
514,00:34:04,00:34:06,Somebody wanted to see you.
515,00:34:06,00:34:07,"Hey, baby."
516,00:34:07,00:34:08,"Hi, Mommy."
517,00:34:09,00:34:10,Daddy's taking me to dinner tonight.
518,00:34:10,00:34:13,He is?
519,00:34:13,00:34:14,Main room at the Orpheus.
520,00:34:14,00:34:19,They have lions and tigers at the restaurant and Daddy said I can go to a show after.
521,00:34:19,00:34:21,"WILLOWS: Well, uh..."
522,00:34:21,00:34:25,"you know, honey, it's a school night so I need to discuss that with Daddy first."
523,00:34:25,00:34:28,"Come on, Mom. It's just this one night."
524,00:34:32,00:34:34,Ed...
525,00:34:34,00:34:36,"Hey, Lindsey, I got some games on my computer."
526,00:34:36,00:34:37,You want to see?
527,00:34:37,00:34:39,"Sure. Come on, let's go play one."
528,00:34:39,00:34:41,"Uh, I'll see you in a bit, honey."
529,00:34:43,00:34:44,You set me up.
530,00:34:44,00:34:46,"How, by taking our daughter to dinner?"
531,00:34:46,00:34:48,Get over here.
532,00:34:48,00:34:50,"Oh, come on now!"
533,00:34:50,00:34:51,What?!
534,00:34:51,00:34:53,You are so pathetic. What?!What?!
535,00:34:53,00:34:54,Just so pathetic.
536,00:34:54,00:34:55,"Watch it, Cath."
537,00:34:56,00:34:59,Sucking up to our daughter 'cause I caught you robbing me.
538,00:34:59,00:35:01,The only thing I ever robbed you of was good sex.
539,00:35:01,00:35:06,"(scoffing): Nosex is worth you, and you are not taking my daughter to a club with one of your music whores."
540,00:35:06,00:35:07,"Oh,they'rewhores?"
541,00:35:07,00:35:11,When I met you you were taking your clothes off in a strip club.
542,00:35:11,00:35:17,"It was a job, Ed and it supported you, just like every job I've had including this one!"
543,00:35:17,00:35:20,Yeah? And who paid to close up your nose?
544,00:35:20,00:35:21,You're such a bast...!
545,00:35:21,00:35:23,Let go of me. What?!
546,00:35:23,00:35:25,I'll let go of you when I'm damn good and...
547,00:35:25,00:35:26,"Let go of her, Ed!"
548,00:35:28,00:35:30,Catherine?
549,00:35:30,00:35:32,Just get him out of here.
550,00:35:36,00:35:38,I don't want to ever see you in this building again.
551,00:35:38,00:35:39,This is our place of business.
552,00:35:39,00:35:40,You understand that?
553,00:35:40,00:35:43,I always knew you two had a thing.
554,00:35:43,00:35:45,"Go home, Eddie."
555,00:35:47,00:35:48,Sure.
556,00:36:00,00:36:06,SARA: ♪ One way or another ♪ (hums)
557,00:36:15,00:36:19,"Hey, Sara, did anyone ever tell you you have a pretty good singing voice?"
558,00:36:19,00:36:21,If you like chalk on a board.
559,00:36:21,00:36:22,Come on. I've heard you around here.
560,00:36:22,00:36:24,People never tell you that?
561,00:36:24,00:36:25,It's a-a habit.
562,00:36:25,00:36:27,I don't even realize I'm doing it.
563,00:36:27,00:36:30,Did you get that belt loop from the crime scene lined up yet?
564,00:36:30,00:36:31,Yeah.
565,00:36:31,00:36:32,"Here, take a look."
566,00:36:39,00:36:41,SARA: Fits like a glove.
567,00:36:41,00:36:43,Okay. Let's go tell the boss.
568,00:36:43,00:36:44,"Uh, you go."
569,00:36:44,00:36:46,I have something to do first.
570,00:36:46,00:36:49,"Hey, if you go nearthat Thorpe kid..."
571,00:36:49,00:36:50,Excuse me?
572,00:36:50,00:36:54,I'm just saying...
573,00:36:55,00:36:57,It's something else.
574,00:36:57,00:36:58,Promise.
575,00:37:03,00:37:05,Wait a minute.
576,00:37:05,00:37:08,"Hastings wasfacingMcCall, and McCall shot him in theback?"
577,00:37:08,00:37:10,"You can't have it both ways, guys."
578,00:37:10,00:37:12,A judge will laugh me out of court.
579,00:37:12,00:37:14,Well... bear with us.
580,00:37:14,00:37:17,All right. I'm McCall.
581,00:37:17,00:37:18,I have a gun.
582,00:37:18,00:37:19,I'm Hastings.
583,00:37:19,00:37:21,I stab McCall in the right arm.
584,00:37:23,00:37:25,WARRICK: I push him back off.
585,00:37:25,00:37:26,And Hastings charges again.
586,00:37:26,00:37:28,This time helunges at his midsection.
587,00:37:29,00:37:31,I shoot.
588,00:37:33,00:37:40,CATHERINE: He shoots from two feet according to our firearms range test and the unburned powder on the victim's clothes.
589,00:37:40,00:37:45,And the bullet enters through the back even though we are facing each other and exits...
590,00:37:45,00:37:46,out the front.
591,00:37:46,00:37:48,The first shot is fired in self-defense.
592,00:37:48,00:37:52,But then McCall shoots Hastings a second time. Now that shot...
593,00:37:52,00:37:53,Boom.
594,00:37:53,00:37:55,...was not in self-defense.
595,00:37:56,00:37:59,(gunshot)
596,00:38:00,00:38:02,(screaming): No!
597,00:38:02,00:38:06,Chalk it up to adrenaline or revenge but Hastings was already going down.
598,00:38:06,00:38:08,There was no reason to shoot him a second time.
599,00:38:08,00:38:10,"I've got to say, I'm impressed."
600,00:38:10,00:38:12,You two just put on quite a show.
601,00:38:12,00:38:14,Think you can do it again at trial?
602,00:38:16,00:38:18,That's our job.
603,00:38:18,00:38:20,"We'll see you in court, Sam."
604,00:38:24,00:38:27,"Hey, how's Linds?"
605,00:38:27,00:38:30,"Um, well, uh, she's with my sister."
606,00:38:30,00:38:33,"Hey, thanks for helping me out there."
607,00:38:33,00:38:34,I appreciate it. I...
608,00:38:34,00:38:36,"You've got to get that divorce finalized, huh?"
609,00:38:56,00:38:59,We caught him.
610,00:38:59,00:39:03,"If you hadn't pulled that belt loop we might never have found him, but..."
611,00:39:03,00:39:06,You did good.
612,00:39:08,00:39:10,You must be Sara.
613,00:39:10,00:39:13,The CSI who called me?
614,00:39:14,00:39:14,Hi.
615,00:39:15,00:39:17,"I'm Tom, uh, Pam's husband."
616,00:39:17,00:39:21,"Thanks, uh, for all you've done."
617,00:39:21,00:39:23,Sure.
618,00:39:23,00:39:25,"Oh, I wanted to give you this."
619,00:39:25,00:39:33,"I've been keeping it... for Jane-- Pam, uh, until I found her family."
620,00:39:33,00:39:35,Thanks.
621,00:39:39,00:39:41,How are you doing?
622,00:39:41,00:39:42,"Okay, uh..."
623,00:39:42,00:39:44,Good.
624,00:39:44,00:39:48,The doctor says Pammie's condition is stabilized.
625,00:39:48,00:39:51,He was in an hour ago.
626,00:39:51,00:39:52,He expects her to live.
627,00:39:52,00:39:54,Says she's not going to die.
628,00:39:54,00:39:57,That's great.
629,00:39:57,00:39:58,That's-that's great.
630,00:39:58,00:40:00,"She's a real fighter, huh?"
631,00:40:00,00:40:04,"THOMAS: Well, we're moving her to Haven View Center later this week."
632,00:40:04,00:40:06,Do-do you know that facility?
633,00:40:06,00:40:10,"Yeah, I do, know people who've gone there."
634,00:40:12,00:40:14,They'll take real good care of her.
635,00:40:14,00:40:19,That's what the doctor said.
636,00:40:19,00:40:21,I got to go.
637,00:40:25,00:40:27,"Well, um, uh..."
638,00:40:27,00:40:29,come see us sometime.
639,00:40:29,00:40:32,Definitely.
640,00:40:32,00:40:34,"Haven View, I'll be there."
641,00:40:36,00:40:38,Good luck.
642,00:40:38,00:40:40,Good luck to you.
643,00:41:12,00:41:17,The husband doesn't get it.
644,00:41:17,00:41:29,He's so happy she's going to live he doesn't realize she's going to be in a vegetative state for the rest of her life.
645,00:41:32,00:41:42,And that kid Thorpe is going to be out of juvie in 48 months.
646,00:41:44,00:41:46,It's not fair.
647,00:41:50,00:41:52,It's the system.
648,00:41:53,00:41:58,What kind of system rewards the suspect when the victim is too tough to die?
649,00:42:08,00:42:10,Sara...
650,00:42:11,00:42:20,you've got to learn to let this go or you're going to spend all your time in hospitals trying to help the people you couldn't save.
651,00:42:22,00:42:24,"I wish I was like you, Grissom."
652,00:42:24,00:42:28,I wish I didn't feel anything.
653,00:42:41,00:42:43,(sighing): Oh.
