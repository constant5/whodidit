0	00:00:02	00:00:07	Once upon a time, there was a reindeer named Winston.
1	00:00:08	00:00:10	Winston was lost.
2	00:00:10	00:00:14	He wandered the city instead of delivering toys in the frost.
3	00:00:17	00:00:19	Did you get it? (reindeer grunts)
4	00:00:19	00:00:21	Winston searched every roof and chimney.
5	00:00:24	00:00:27	Where, oh, where could jolly Santa be?
6	00:00:41	00:00:44	Thank you.
7	00:00:45	00:00:47	Happy holidays.
8	00:00:47	00:00:52	Not for Santa, I hear. BRASS a lot of disappointed kids this year.
9	00:00:52	00:00:54	Wow. Snow in Vegas.
10	00:00:54	00:01:00	Well, this White Christmas is brought to you courtesy of the Winter Wonderland Company-- the employee Jayson Walt, he's over there.
11	00:01:00	00:01:06	Reindeer wrangler, snowmaker, jack-of-all-trades. He comes to work this morning, finds a dead Santa and a missing reindeer.
12	00:01:06	00:01:08	They went all out.
13	00:01:08	00:01:15	Patrol found Dasher about an hour ago on the Strip, blood in his fur. Animal Control brought him here, and Jayson Walt identified him as Dasher.
14	00:01:15	00:01:17	David Phillips has the I.D. on the dead guy.
15	00:01:17	00:01:18	Good luck.
16	00:01:22	00:01:28	David, got a name yet? Lucky for us the victim is not a Secret Santa.
17	00:01:28	00:01:30	He's got business cards, everything.
18	00:01:31	00:01:35	Brad Fante--your friendly neighborhood I.T. guy.
19	00:01:35	00:01:37	Works for Bonham Realty.
20	00:01:37	00:01:39	Must have been the company Kringle.
21	00:01:39	00:01:45	Liver temp tells me he died between 00 and 1 femoral arteries were severed.
22	00:01:45	00:01:49	So he bled out. What are those, bloody hoofprints? Looks like it.
23	00:01:51	00:01:59	So the reindeer sees Santa here die violently, breaks out of the pen, tracks through the fresh blood.
24	00:01:59	00:02:01	And I thought Rudolph had it bad.
25	00:02:06	00:02:08	There's blood on the runner here.
26	00:02:08	00:02:12	He was definitely run over by the sleigh.
27	00:02:12	00:02:14	Uh... Russell?
28	00:02:14	00:02:17	I got a lot of blood at his back.
29	00:02:18	00:02:20	Could you help me flip him?
30	00:02:29	00:02:31	Five sharp-force injuries.
31	00:02:31	00:02:33	That's a lot of blood, so he was still alive when he was stabbed.
32	00:02:35	00:02:41	This is not an accident. Grandma may have gotten run over by a reindeer, but Santa got sleighed.
33	00:03:23	00:03:27	It's already 50 degrees, the sun's still rising.
34	00:03:27	00:03:29	It's supposed to get up to 70 today.
35	00:03:29	00:03:36	Our main priority is to record and preserve-- analyze everything when we get back to the lab.
36	00:03:36	00:03:38	Are we good for shoe impressions?
37	00:03:38	00:03:39	Good?
38	00:03:39	00:03:41	To collect them from the snow.
39	00:03:41	00:03:45	I'm guessing you didn't process many cold scenes in L.A.
40	00:03:45	00:03:51	(laughs) Try none. All right, well, heat is usually the battle here in Vegas, but today it's snow.
41	00:03:51	00:03:58	Blood doesn't read the same way, the drops blend in, no spines, and prints don't lift easily. Yeah, makes sense.
42	00:03:58	00:04:06	So we are going to need liquid cold wax to process any impressions, and dry ice, too. All right.
43	00:04:06	00:04:08	I'll call Hodges and have him bring it on over.
44	00:04:13	00:04:15	Right this way.
45	00:04:16	00:04:19	Hi. I'm Ryan Bonham. Sorry I kept you waiting.
46	00:04:19	00:04:20	I had to check on my son Blake.
47	00:04:20	00:04:23	I, uh, just can't believe all this. No.
48	00:04:23	00:04:27	It's a hell of a thing. Sorry, I'm gonna have to ask you a few questions here.
49	00:04:27	00:04:30	How well did you know the victim, Mr. Fante?
50	00:04:30	00:04:34	I didn't know him that well-- I mean, he'd been with my company for a few months.
51	00:04:34	00:04:37	He was all psyched to organize the Christmas party.
52	00:04:37	00:04:40	Get along with the other employees? Oh, yeah.
53	00:04:40	00:04:42	Brad worked miracles with computers.
54	00:04:42	00:04:43	Everyone loved him.
55	00:04:43	00:04:45	He made a perfect Santa.
56	00:04:45	00:04:48	Is there anything you can tell me about last night? Not really, no.
57	00:04:48	00:04:52	I mean, you know, the company had a great year, everybody was partying, they were happy.
58	00:04:52	00:04:55	00, I went upstairs to put Blake to bed.
59	00:04:55	00:04:59	He's six now. Christmas is a bit of a tough time for him.
60	00:04:59	00:05:01	Mm. For me, too.
61	00:05:01	00:05:02	My, uh...
62	00:05:02	00:05:04	my wife died...
63	00:05:04	00:05:08	two years ago, Christmas Eve.
64	00:05:08	00:05:09	Sorry to hear that.
65	00:05:09	00:05:11	Yeah.
66	00:05:11	00:05:20	Uh, anyway, like I said, I stayed with him, I fell asleep, the sirens woke me up, and I looked out my window... you know, I thought I'd seen my share of Christmas tragedy in my life, but...
67	00:05:21	00:05:24	I guess not.
68	00:05:24	00:05:28	You had a long night, huh, Dash? Yeah.
69	00:05:28	00:05:29	Bet you're hungry, huh?
70	00:05:29	00:05:31	That's all right, we're gonna get you some grub.
71	00:05:31	00:05:34	Yeah, we'll get you some food. Mr. Walt?
72	00:05:35	00:05:36	Yeah, that's me.
73	00:05:36	00:05:39	Hey. I'm, uh, CSI Sanders.
74	00:05:39	00:05:41	I'm here to... process your reindeer.
75	00:05:41	00:05:45	Process? You don't mean put him down? No, I...
76	00:05:45	00:05:48	just need to collect a sample of blood from his fur.
77	00:05:48	00:05:56	Why? Well, he walked through a crime scene, and the blood could be from our victim or even from our killer.
78	00:05:56	00:05:58	Okay.
79	00:06:04	00:06:06	It's okay, boy.
80	00:06:06	00:06:08	It's just a little cotton on a stick.
81	00:06:08	00:06:14	Good. Do you always leave your reindeer out at night? Oh, yeah, yeah, they like it. Yeah, what with the snow?
82	00:06:14	00:06:15	Reminds them of Iceland.
83	00:06:15	00:06:18	Only place in the world you can find real reindeer.
84	00:06:18	00:06:24	Yeah, they sleep by the glaciers. Hey, you think Dasher saw who did it? Um...
85	00:06:24	00:06:26	it's... certainly possible.
86	00:06:26	00:06:28	You know, I saw this thing on the news.
87	00:06:28	00:06:30	They're giving MRIs to dogs now.
88	00:06:30	00:06:33	Their brains are a lot like ours.
89	00:06:33	00:06:39	Old Dasher here, he can't tell us what he saw, but, you know, maybe someday we'll know what he's thinking.
90	00:06:40	00:06:41	All right, well, uh...
91	00:06:41	00:06:44	I think I got what I need. Thanks.
92	00:06:46	00:06:48	Hey, Dash.
93	00:06:48	00:06:50	Good boy. That was good.
94	00:06:50	00:06:52	Yeah.
95	00:06:54	00:06:56	You got something?
96	00:06:56	00:06:58	Yeah, partial boot impression.
97	00:06:58	00:07:00	I checked it against Santa's--it's not his.
98	00:07:00	00:07:02	Blood drop inside.
99	00:07:02	00:07:04	Got blood drops over here as well.
100	00:07:04	00:07:07	Man, Greg was right.
101	00:07:07	00:07:11	You can't tell directionality. But they are close to where the body was.
102	00:07:11	00:07:13	Could be gravitational. Suggests...
103	00:07:13	00:07:15	this is the area where it all happened.
104	00:07:15	00:07:23	Santa gets stabbed in the back, grabs at his wounds, trying to stop the bleeding, but the blood is flowing.
105	00:07:23	00:07:25	Bumps into the sled, dislodges it.
106	00:07:25	00:07:28	Sled slides downhill and...
107	00:07:28	00:07:30	And the elf kingdom weeps.
108	00:07:30	00:07:32	Time for our trusty ice wax.
109	00:07:34	00:07:37	I had to use this in the infamous Mount Charleston Chalet Murder.
110	00:07:37	00:07:39	Death by ski pole. Long story.
111	00:07:39	00:07:41	So, how does it work exactly?
112	00:07:41	00:07:50	The wax preserves the impression, insulating the snow, preventing any loss of detail caused by heat from the exothermic reaction of the casting material.
113	00:07:57	00:07:58	And...
114	00:07:58	00:08:01	voil√†-- frosty cast.
115	00:08:01	00:08:04	Nice. Um, what about the blood drops?
116	00:08:05	00:08:06	You can take them to go.
117	00:08:08	00:08:10	All right.
118	00:08:10	00:08:15	Why do you think Santa was hanging out here all by his lonesome after the party?
119	00:08:15	00:08:21	He was probably recovering from the forced levity of a hyper-commercialized holiday that's lost all sense of wonder. Wow.
120	00:08:21	00:08:24	Somebody got a lot of coal in his stocking as a kid. I wish.
121	00:08:24	00:08:29	Instead of regaling me with stories of Santa, my scientist father lectured me on the implausibility of the whole thing.
122	00:08:29	00:08:34	What, he didn't think a fat man in a sleigh could make it around the world in one night?
123	00:08:34	00:08:39	He also had a problem with the climate damage caused by toy factories in the North Pole.
124	00:08:39	00:08:43	God, I hope I don't have you as my Secret Santa. (chuckles)
125	00:08:43	00:08:46	I can't believe we're actually doing it again this year.
126	00:08:59	00:09:01	Must be Bonham's kid.
127	00:09:01	00:09:03	I wonder if he saw anything.
128	00:09:03	00:09:05	I don't think anybody's talked to him yet.
129	00:09:05	00:09:08	Maybe we should take a shot at it.
130	00:09:08	00:09:11	Aren't vaguely Dickensian suburban kids Russell's department?
131	00:09:20	00:09:22	Season's greetings, Doctor.
132	00:09:22	00:09:24	Yeah? How's it going in here?
133	00:09:24	00:09:29	Well, our friend here, Mr. Fante, is definitely on someone's naughty list.
134	00:09:29	00:09:31	Looks like you got Secret Santa'd.
135	00:09:31	00:09:32	You gonna open it?
136	00:09:32	00:09:35	Why don't you do the honors for me, Nick.
137	00:09:35	00:09:36	All right.
138	00:09:41	00:09:43	Herbal tea.
139	00:09:43	00:09:44	Mmm.
140	00:09:44	00:09:46	I think you got Russell.
141	00:09:47	00:09:52	I think our victim got more than a stab in the back.
142	00:09:52	00:09:54	He's got a cut on the cheek, and bruising.
143	00:09:54	00:09:58	Well, maybe he was punched before he was knifed.
144	00:09:58	00:10:00	Fiber in the wound.
145	00:10:00	00:10:02	You know, that almost looks synthetic.
146	00:10:02	00:10:04	Killer could have been wearing gloves.
147	00:10:08	00:10:10	The stabbing was particularly vicious.
148	00:10:10	00:10:13	The killer twisted the blade.
149	00:10:13	00:10:16	Well, that's the personal touch right there.
150	00:10:16	00:10:17	Okay.
151	00:10:17	00:10:20	Christmas party, bunch of booze flowing.
152	00:10:20	00:10:21	Two guys just got in a fight.
153	00:10:23	00:10:25	I know we got to wait on tox, but...
154	00:10:25	00:10:27	did you find any alcohol in his stomach?
155	00:10:27	00:10:28	Nope, just milk and cookies.
156	00:10:28	00:10:31	Mr. Claus was a teetotaler.
157	00:10:31	00:10:33	Okay, there goes the drunken-brawl theory.
158	00:10:33	00:10:35	But one thing is for sure.
159	00:10:35	00:10:40	Jolly St. Nick here must have pissed somebody off.
160	00:10:40	00:10:43	Winston looked east, and he looked west.
161	00:10:43	00:10:46	He saw a light in the distance, maybe a place to rest.
162	00:10:46	00:10:48	Winston... (phone ringing)
163	00:10:48	00:10:54	Whoops. Then Mommy got a call from Daddy, and she had to put the book down.
164	00:10:54	00:10:55	(laughs) Phone.
165	00:10:58	00:11:00	Is that your mom? Uh-huh.
166	00:11:00	00:11:02	She didn't get to the end of the story.
167	00:11:02	00:11:04	Yeah.
168	00:11:04	00:11:06	The Lost Reindeer.
169	00:11:06	00:11:09	You must watch that a lot.
170	00:11:09	00:11:11	Did you watch it with your daddy last night?
171	00:11:11	00:11:12	Yeah. He fell asleep.
172	00:11:12	00:11:14	He was tired.
173	00:11:14	00:11:21	Well, after your dad went to sleep, did you happen to see or hear anything outside?
174	00:11:21	00:11:23	I saw the Christmas tree lights go off downtown.
175	00:11:23	00:11:25	Well, you know, you got to stay up pretty late.
176	00:11:25	00:11:27	Do you think maybe you happened to see anything else?
177	00:11:27	00:11:29	I saw a reindeer.
178	00:11:29	00:11:32	I did, too, right outside there.
179	00:11:32	00:11:34	It's pretty awesome, right?
180	00:11:34	00:11:36	Not that reindeer. The one in the house.
181	00:11:38	00:11:41	You saw a reindeer in the house?
182	00:11:41	00:11:42	On the staircase.
183	00:11:42	00:11:48	It had its head down, pawing at the floor, so I got scared and shut my door.
184	00:11:48	00:11:55	I think, young man, what you were experiencing was a dream, REM sleep.
185	00:11:55	00:12:05	During REM sleep, a pretty awesome brain chemical called acetylcholine becomes active, subduing other neurotransmitters.
186	00:12:05	00:12:10	Now, this excess acetylcholine is what makes you dream.
187	00:12:10	00:12:13	So, nothing you saw was real.
188	00:12:13	00:12:15	Is Santa real?
189	00:12:15	00:12:17	Yes. Yes.
190	00:12:17	00:12:19	Santa is very real.
191	00:12:52	00:12:55	So, what is the snow report?
192	00:12:55	00:13:01	Uh, DNA from the blood drops in the snow are all a match to our victim, Brad Fante.
193	00:13:01	00:13:05	And as far as that partial boot print goes, it's from a Timberland, size unknown.
194	00:13:05	00:13:11	We got a list of all of the shoes worn by the 22 guests who were in attendance at the party.
195	00:13:11	00:13:12	No match to any of them.
196	00:13:12	00:13:13	Nor the home owner, Ryan.
197	00:13:13	00:13:15	Nor our reindeer wrangler.
198	00:13:15	00:13:17	So, I guess snow's a white-out.
199	00:13:17	00:13:18	Snow far.
200	00:13:18	00:13:22	I've been letting it melt so I could strain the water for more trace.
201	00:13:26	00:13:28	Oh.
202	00:13:28	00:13:30	I don't think I'll need a strainer for that.
203	00:13:31	00:13:35	Must have been buried underneath the snow.
204	00:13:38	00:13:41	Hmm. That looks biological.
205	00:13:41	00:13:43	Maybe part of the victim's intestine?
206	00:13:43	00:13:45	Possibly.
207	00:13:45	00:13:48	I'll run it and find out.
208	00:13:50	00:13:52	Hey, David, uh... (clears throat)
209	00:13:55	00:13:57	It's a good look for you.
210	00:13:57	00:13:59	The antlers are all business, my friend.
211	00:13:59	00:14:02	Fiber found in our victim, Brad Fante's, cheek wound.
212	00:14:02	00:14:06	Made from specific modacrylic polymers and dye.
213	00:14:06	00:14:10	Used in fake fur and... this.
214	00:14:10	00:14:11	Reindeer costume.
215	00:14:11	00:14:15	Purchased at a local costume store, complete with furry hoof gloves.
216	00:14:15	00:14:24	Now, I'm thinking that some time before he got knifed, our Santa took a left hoof at the party from a pantomime reindeer.
217	00:14:24	00:14:26	You're kidding me.
218	00:14:26	00:14:28	If the reindeer glove fits, you need not acquit.
219	00:14:28	00:14:32	Could also explain what little Blake Bonham saw at the bottom of the stairs.
220	00:14:32	00:14:35	And maybe our party animal left something behind.
221	00:15:20	00:15:27	Hodges' theory that it was someone in a reindeer costume at Ryan Bonham's party was correct, except for one detail.
222	00:15:27	00:15:29	Ah. It was a woman.
223	00:15:29	00:15:31	Looking for her contact lens.
224	00:15:31	00:15:34	I found it on the staircase, traced the I.D. number.
225	00:15:34	00:15:36	Rachel Walker, 23.
226	00:15:36	00:15:38	No record.
227	00:15:38	00:15:39	This woman worked at Bonham Realty?
228	00:15:39	00:15:46	No. Actually, she worked at another fine Vegas establishment-- the Cathedral Strip Club.
229	00:15:46	00:15:48	Featured dancer.
230	00:15:48	00:15:50	Miss Reindeer.
231	00:15:50	00:15:52	Well, that's quite an honor.
232	00:15:52	00:15:56	According to her bio, she beat out seven other strippers for the rack.
233	00:15:57	00:15:59	Antlers. Crown.
234	00:15:59	00:16:07	I got it. You know, I didn't get the sense that Ryan Bonham's Christmas party was that kind of party, so, why did he have Miss Reindeer at his house?
235	00:16:07	00:16:09	Well, apparently, Mr. Bonham didn't know anything about it.
236	00:16:09	00:16:11	I spoke to the strip club.
237	00:16:11	00:16:17	It was Brad Fante who hired the girl and asked her to come late at night after all the children were nestled snug in their beds.
238	00:16:17	00:16:18	So, what are you thinking?
239	00:16:18	00:16:22	That after the dancing stopped, Santa got a little out of hand?
240	00:16:22	00:16:27	Yeah, and Miss Reindeer here decided she didn't want to play anymore of his reindeer games.
241	00:16:53	00:16:55	I get it, but, enough, all right?
242	00:16:55	00:16:57	Let's get to the good part.
243	00:16:57	00:16:58	You asked what happened. I'm telling you.
244	00:16:58	00:17:03	I was doing my number, doing my thing for Fante and his buddy.
245	00:17:03	00:17:06	I was okay with the home movies.
246	00:17:06	00:17:08	I was not okay with the free porno.
247	00:17:08	00:17:10	What do you think you're doing?
248	00:17:10	00:17:15	Come on, vixen. Santa screwing one of his reindeer? It'll be the greatest sex tape of all time!
249	00:17:15	00:17:16	Are you getting this, Fred?!
250	00:17:16	00:17:17	No! No!
251	00:17:19	00:17:21	Yeah, but a reindeer punching Santa?
252	00:17:21	00:17:22	That's just wrong.
253	00:17:22	00:17:24	He had it coming.
254	00:17:24	00:17:27	I'm no saint, but I'm not a whore.
255	00:17:27	00:17:28	But you could be a killer.
256	00:17:28	00:17:30	Look, Rachel, I get it, I get it.
257	00:17:30	00:17:32	You're both professional pole dancers.
258	00:17:32	00:17:33	You work the stripper pole, he works the North Pole.
259	00:17:33	00:17:38	So, he paid for a lap dance, and then he wanted to take you to the North Pole, show you the workshop for free.
260	00:17:38	00:17:44	And he wouldn't take no for an answer, so you got in a little tussle, you had to defend yourself--I get it. Oh!
261	00:17:44	00:17:46	I'm telling you, I didn't kill him.
262	00:17:46	00:17:47	Guy wasn't worth it.
263	00:17:47	00:17:52	After I hit him, I went upstairs, I changed my clothes, and I got out of there.
264	00:17:52	00:17:55	Rachel, we have tape of you slugging Father Christmas!
265	00:17:55	00:17:57	I know. Fred Larkin.
266	00:17:57	00:17:59	He recorded the whole thing.
267	00:17:59	00:18:00	Go ahead, talk to him.
268	00:18:00	00:18:05	He's the one that gave me a ride home, bought me breakfast at R.J.'s.
269	00:18:05	00:18:07	Fante was alive when we left.
270	00:18:09	00:18:11	So I go the security cam footage back from R.J.'s diner.
271	00:18:11	00:18:15	It confirms Rachel Walker and Fred Larkin's story.
272	00:18:15	00:18:21	Doc said T.O.D. on Brad Fante 00 a.m.
273	00:18:21	00:18:25	So, they definitely have alibis, according to the time stamp.
274	00:18:25	00:18:26	So, where does that leave us?
275	00:18:26	00:18:29	With no suspect and a lot of work to do.
276	00:18:29	00:18:32	Yeah. New bracelet?
277	00:18:32	00:18:34	That is very observant of you.
278	00:18:34	00:18:37	Well, it's why they pay me the big bucks.
279	00:18:37	00:18:40	Come on. You're dying for me to say, Thank you. That was so generous.
280	00:18:40	00:18:43	I don't know what you're talking about.
281	00:18:43	00:18:44	Yes, you do.
282	00:18:44	00:18:45	No, I don't.
283	00:18:45	00:18:48	Okay, well, I'm your Secret Santa.
284	00:18:48	00:18:54	And I was planning on matching your generosity with something that I think you would really like.
285	00:18:54	00:18:56	Well, I hate to break your heart, but I'm not your Secret Santa.
286	00:18:56	00:18:57	Really?
287	00:18:57	00:18:59	Really.
288	00:18:59	00:19:01	Well, that's unfortunate.
289	00:19:01	00:19:04	Very unfortunate for you.
290	00:19:06	00:19:08	Ah. I hate Christmas.
291	00:19:08	00:19:15	Hey. Finn said you found some mystery tissue in one of the snow samples I took from the scene.
292	00:19:15	00:19:17	Not a mystery anymore.
293	00:19:17	00:19:18	Is it from our victim?
294	00:19:18	00:19:20	No. In fact, it's not even human.
295	00:19:20	00:19:22	Sarda Chiliensis Lineolata.
296	00:19:22	00:19:26	Otherwise known as Pacific Bonito. Bonito?
297	00:19:26	00:19:27	Well, they use it in sushi.
298	00:19:27	00:19:29	Did they serve that at the party?
299	00:19:29	00:19:32	Well, if so, it's not the only thing that they were serving.
300	00:19:32	00:19:34	I ran tox on the fish guts.
301	00:19:34	00:19:36	Found traces of cocaine.
302	00:19:36	00:19:38	We know Brad Fante organized the office party.
303	00:19:38	00:19:41	He went off-script hiring Miss Reindeer.
304	00:19:41	00:19:44	Who knows what else he had planned for the night.
305	00:19:44	00:19:47	We know he ordered bonito with a side of coke.
306	00:19:47	00:19:51	We know that he tried to stiff the stripper, in more ways than one.
307	00:19:51	00:19:56	Well, if he was cheap with the stripper, maybe he stiffed his dealer, too.
308	00:19:56	00:19:59	Then got stiffed.
309	00:19:59	00:20:03	This is Brad Fante's little helper, Fred Larkin.
310	00:20:03	00:20:08	Not only did he film the stripper doing her reindeer dance, he also taped most of the party.
311	00:20:08	00:20:12	So, I've been going through it, hoping I'd see the killer getting into some kind of beef with Santa.
312	00:20:12	00:20:13	What did you find?
313	00:20:13	00:20:15	Oh, typical Christmas party stuff.
314	00:20:15	00:20:22	A quiet guy singing, unlikely couple hooking up, office joker crying in his beer.
315	00:20:22	00:20:23	Anything unexpected?
316	00:20:23	00:20:27	Yeah. I found two Santas.
317	00:20:27	00:20:29	Take a look at this.
318	00:20:29	00:20:30	Here's the first thing I noticed.
319	00:20:30	00:20:34	Santa pounding a glass of wine.
320	00:20:34	00:20:36	It's a party. So what?
321	00:20:36	00:20:38	Well, according to the doc, he didn't drink alcohol.
322	00:20:38	00:20:40	Stomach contents were just milk and cookies.
323	00:20:40	00:20:42	So, take a look at this.
324	00:20:43	00:20:44	This is 20 minutes later.
325	00:20:44	00:20:49	There's our wine-drinking Santa, and it looks like he gets a phone call.
326	00:20:49	00:20:58	Now, it must have been pretty important, because I think that's when he ditched the party and lent his suit to Brad Fante, who, as we know, had his own plans for what to do with that.
327	00:20:58	00:21:01	And how do we know it's the same suit? Look right here.
328	00:21:02	00:21:03	The sleeve.
329	00:21:03	00:21:05	See the stain?
330	00:21:05	00:21:07	45 minutes later.
331	00:21:07	00:21:10	Same suit, different watches, different beverages...
332	00:21:11	00:21:18	...different Santas. Well, it's easy for us to tell them apart, because we have this video, we have forensics, but...
333	00:21:18	00:21:20	what if the killer couldn't?
334	00:21:20	00:21:23	Well, we've run out of suspects with motives to kill the guy.
335	00:21:23	00:21:26	Maybe Brad Fante was not the target.
336	00:21:26	00:21:28	No. No, the target...
337	00:21:28	00:21:31	was this other Santa.
338	00:21:32	00:21:35	So, who is he?
339	00:21:39	00:21:43	At Winter Wonderland, we'll create a winter wonderland you'll never forget.
340	00:21:43	00:21:47	We're your first and last stop for all your holiday needs.
341	00:21:47	00:21:53	Hey! We'll even supply you with real snow, a live reindeer and all the trimmings.
342	00:21:53	00:21:57	Including old St. Nick, himself--ho, ho, ho!
343	00:21:57	00:22:00	So, come on down to Winter Wonderland.
344	00:22:00	00:22:02	And tell 'em Jayson sent you.
345	00:22:02	00:22:08	So, our reindeer wrangler neglected to tell us that Santa was part of the Winter Wonderland package.
346	00:22:08	00:22:12	According to Greg, he passed himself off as just an employee.
347	00:22:12	00:22:17	Looks like he owns the company. That still doesn't tell us why someone tried to kill him, though.
348	00:22:17	00:22:18	I might be able to help with that.
349	00:22:18	00:22:24	What do you got? Well, you know the cocaine-laced bonito we found in the snow at Ryan Bonham's yard?
350	00:22:24	00:22:27	Well, it turns out that bonito wasn't served at the party.
351	00:22:27	00:22:29	So how'd it get there?
352	00:22:29	00:22:31	It was already in the ice.
353	00:22:32	00:22:33	How does that work?
354	00:22:33	00:22:34	Well, I ran the truck manifest.
355	00:22:34	00:22:43	When it's not working holiday parties, it makes a lot of trips from Mexico to Vegas, transporting Pacific Bonito-- on ice.
356	00:22:43	00:22:45	Bonito stuffed with cocaine.
357	00:22:48	00:22:53	Which is how remnants of bonito and coke got mixed in with ice.
358	00:22:53	00:22:57	The same ice used to make the snow.
359	00:22:57	00:23:00	Jayson Walt thought he was providing a little snow for Christmas.
360	00:23:00	00:23:05	What he didn't realize is that he was adding a little powder to the powder.
361	00:23:05	00:23:08	Well, that gives us motive for someone to try to kill him.
362	00:23:08	00:23:10	Guy's a major drug runner.
363	00:23:10	00:23:11	Could've been working with cartels in Mexico.
364	00:23:11	00:23:13	That's one Bad Santa.
365	00:23:13	00:23:18	That's one dead Santa, if we don't bring him in before the killer finds him.
366	00:23:23	00:23:24	Thanks for coming in, Mr. Walt.
367	00:23:24	00:23:26	I know it's a busy time of year for you.
368	00:23:26	00:23:28	LVPD interested in a White Christmas party?
369	00:23:28	00:23:29	No.
370	00:23:29	00:23:33	I'm interested in a dead Santa that was found in Ryan Bonham's lawn.
371	00:23:33	00:23:36	33, you were the guy in the red suit playing Santa.
372	00:23:36	00:23:37	You didn't tell us that.
373	00:23:37	00:23:42	Nobody asked. Look, pal, whoever killed the guy in the suit was after you.
374	00:23:42	00:23:45	No way. Why would anyone want to kill me?
375	00:23:45	00:23:48	I don't know, maybe 'cause you're running drugs from Mexico in your ice truck.
376	00:23:48	00:23:53	Yeah, we found fish guts laced with cocaine on Ryan Bonham's lawn.
377	00:23:53	00:23:55	Okay, look.
378	00:23:55	00:23:57	This is the part of the interview where you help us help you.
379	00:23:57	00:23:58	Oh, yeah. How's that?
380	00:23:58	00:24:08	Well, in your line of business-- and I'm not talking about spreading holiday cheer by putting fake snow on lawns--I'm talking about the other kind of cheer with the other kind of snow.
381	00:24:08	00:24:10	Now, obviously, you've made enemies.
382	00:24:10	00:24:14	You tell us who they are, we'll help you broker a deal with the DEA.
383	00:24:14	00:24:17	And what if I don't want to you help me?
384	00:24:17	00:24:19	Well, then it's a quick trip upstate.
385	00:24:19	00:24:22	And the inmates up there have absolutely no goodwill toward men.
386	00:24:22	00:24:24	Yeah, I think I'll take my chances.
387	00:24:24	00:24:26	I'm trying to save your life.
388	00:24:26	00:24:28	Yeah, or maybe you're trying to work an angle.
389	00:24:28	00:24:31	Wouldn't be the first party to have sushi and coke delivered.
390	00:24:31	00:24:33	Plus, I don't buy that you got evidence that I'm the delivery boy.
391	00:24:33	00:24:38	So, if we're through here, I'm late for my next Santa gig.
392	00:24:38	00:24:40	Sit down, Kringle.
393	00:24:40	00:24:42	Sit back down!
394	00:24:42	00:24:44	We have evidence.
395	00:24:44	00:24:45	We have your snow. We have your product.
396	00:24:45	00:24:48	Someone's gonna read you your rights.
397	00:24:48	00:24:50	You're under arrest.
398	00:24:50	00:24:51	Process him.
399	00:25:01	00:25:02	Nail polish?
400	00:25:02	00:25:04	For your mistletoes.
401	00:25:04	00:25:06	It's cute.
402	00:25:06	00:25:07	I like.
403	00:25:07	00:25:08	Total chick gift.
404	00:25:08	00:25:10	I bet Finn's your Secret Santa.
405	00:25:10	00:25:11	Maybe.
406	00:25:11	00:25:13	Or maybe it's you, trying to cleverly trick me.
407	00:25:13	00:25:17	Well, I guess we'll just have to wait for the office party, and all will be revealed.
408	00:25:17	00:25:19	In the meantime...
409	00:25:19	00:25:27	Check this out, I just got Jayson Walt's phone records. For the last week, he has been in touch with someone at Ely prison.
410	00:25:27	00:25:29	What, making reservations? No.
411	00:25:29	00:25:33	Texting and talking with his convict older brother, Gary Lee Walt.
412	00:25:33	00:25:34	What's Gary in for?
413	00:25:34	00:25:35	Drug trafficking.
414	00:25:35	00:25:40	So maybe the little brother is holding the family business together while big brother's inside.
415	00:25:40	00:25:46	That's what I thought, until I looked at Gary Lee's trial transcript.
416	00:25:46	00:25:50	Last year, Jayson Walt turned state's evidence and testified against his own brother.
417	00:25:50	00:25:52	Well, he was probably just trying to save his own ass.
418	00:25:52	00:25:56	And his own piece of the drug trafficking pie.
419	00:25:56	00:25:58	So, why do you think they're talking now?
420	00:25:58	00:26:00	Gary Lee just won an appeal.
421	00:26:00	00:26:02	He has a hearing scheduled.
422	00:26:02	00:26:06	How much you want to bet older brother's gonna try and convince younger brother to change his story?
423	00:26:06	00:26:08	Yeah.
424	00:26:08	00:26:09	With a little cash incentive.
425	00:26:09	00:26:11	Take a look at this last communication.
426	00:26:11	00:26:14	Make it 200.
427	00:26:14	00:26:15	Can't.
428	00:26:15	00:26:17	No deal, bro.
429	00:26:17	00:26:26	Brotherly love. Two days after this exchange, Brad Fante was knifed in the back, just after Jayson loaned him his Santa suit.
430	00:26:26	00:26:29	So, big brother tries to cut a Kringle...
431	00:26:29	00:26:30	and misses.
432	00:26:30	00:26:33	I think it's time for us to make a trip to Ely.
433	00:26:33	00:26:35	Well, we don't even have to go that far.
434	00:26:35	00:26:38	Gary Lee was just admitted to Desert Palm Hospital.
435	00:26:38	00:26:40	Kidney failure.
436	00:26:42	00:26:44	Mr. Walt.
437	00:26:44	00:26:46	I'm CSI Stokes.
438	00:26:46	00:26:51	With the LVPD. I'm here to ask you a few questions about your brother, Jayson.
439	00:26:51	00:26:53	What about him?
440	00:26:53	00:26:55	Well, it seems like somebody's trying to kill him.
441	00:26:55	00:26:57	It's not surprising.
442	00:26:57	00:26:59	My little brother has a way of pissing people off.
443	00:26:59	00:27:04	Like you. Seems like you'd get pissed off pretty easily.
444	00:27:04	00:27:09	Course, I wouldn't blame you, after what he did to you last year-- turning his back on you like that.
445	00:27:09	00:27:11	Jayson was just a scared little kid.
446	00:27:11	00:27:13	Lied.
447	00:27:13	00:27:14	He's gonna come clean now.
448	00:27:14	00:27:19	Really? I don't know, it doesn't seem like you two kiss and make up that easy.
449	00:27:19	00:27:20	What tells you that?
450	00:27:20	00:27:22	Pictures.
451	00:27:22	00:27:24	I think your hit man made a mistake.
452	00:27:24	00:27:27	That's supposed to be your brother, isn't it?
453	00:27:27	00:27:29	I think you're the one who's making the mistake.
454	00:27:29	00:27:33	'Cause Jayson is the last person in the world I would want to kill.
455	00:27:33	00:27:38	Because he's gonna deliver the greatest Christmas present ever.
456	00:27:38	00:27:40	He's gonna give me my life back.
457	00:27:40	00:27:43	In court and right here, in the hospital.
458	00:27:43	00:27:51	'Cause, you see, we've got perfect matching leukocyte antigens.
459	00:27:51	00:27:53	Jayson's gonna be your kidney donor.
460	00:27:53	00:27:55	Real proud of my little bro.
461	00:27:55	00:27:57	He's stepping up. Family.
462	00:27:57	00:28:00	Yeah, family. You know, I've read your texts.
463	00:28:00	00:28:02	I know you two were haggling over money, and I know you were paying him.
464	00:28:02	00:28:06	Well...we all need a little incentive.
465	00:28:06	00:28:09	Yeah, but he wasn't happy with what you were offering.
466	00:28:09	00:28:14	And now, unfortunately for you, I don't think he's gonna be available.
467	00:28:15	00:28:18	Sorry.
468	00:28:21	00:28:22	News flash.
469	00:28:24	00:28:26	Jayson and I arrived at a number.
470	00:28:26	00:28:29	And we came to an understanding.
471	00:28:29	00:28:31	Including a little advance.
472	00:28:31	00:28:33	For his bail.
473	00:28:33	00:28:34	His bail.
474	00:28:34	00:28:35	That's right.
475	00:28:35	00:28:37	He's getting out just about now.
476	00:28:37	00:28:40	Tomorrow he'll be in here saving my sorry ass.
477	00:28:40	00:28:43	Week after that, he'll be recanting.
478	00:28:43	00:28:48	Then I'm going to have the merriest Christmas Vegas has ever seen.
479	00:28:51	00:28:52	Ho, ho, ho.
480	00:28:52	00:29:00	So the guy we thought had the best motive for killing Jayson Walt is actually the guy who has the least desire to see any harm come to him.
481	00:29:00	00:29:03	Yeah, without his brother's kidney, Gary Lee's a dead man.
482	00:29:07	00:29:08	What are you thinking?
483	00:29:08	00:29:10	You got anything?
484	00:29:10	00:29:11	The autopsy.
485	00:29:11	00:29:15	It shows us that the killer stabbed the victim and then twisted that knife.
486	00:29:15	00:29:19	Right. We thought it was personal. Okay, what if it was more than just personal?
487	00:29:19	00:29:26	I mean, given the fact that Gary Lee needs a kidney so desperately, what if their total destruction was the killer's intent?
488	00:29:26	00:29:27	You know what I mean?
489	00:29:27	00:29:31	You destroy Jayson Walt's kidneys, you're in effect killing Gary Lee Walt.
490	00:29:31	00:29:33	Murder by proxy.
491	00:29:33	00:29:36	So our question is who wants Gary Lee Walt dead?
492	00:29:36	00:29:40	I give you Gary Lee Walt's greatest hits.
493	00:29:40	00:29:41	Allegedly.
494	00:29:41	00:29:45	These are all drug related kills that he is suspected of ordering.
495	00:29:45	00:29:49	Mala Noche's... Mad-10's... Aquila Cartel.
496	00:29:49	00:29:50	Anyone of them could've ordered the hit.
497	00:29:50	00:29:51	Yeah, that's what I thought.
498	00:29:51	00:29:54	Until I came to this crime scene.
499	00:29:54	00:29:58	Ryan Bonham's wife, Eva.
500	00:29:58	00:30:01	He told us that she died two years ago on Christmas Eve.
501	00:30:01	00:30:03	This is how.
502	00:30:03	00:30:06	Eva Bonham worked at a Savings &amp; Loan.
503	00:30:06	00:30:10	Yes. Gary Lee Walt was laundering his drug money at that bank.
504	00:30:10	00:30:14	An executive found out, was about to go to the police.
505	00:30:14	00:30:16	But Gary Lee Walt got to him first.
506	00:30:16	00:30:20	Eva Bonham was working late that night and became collateral damage.
507	00:30:20	00:30:24	Leaving behind a husband to care for their little boy alone.
508	00:30:24	00:30:27	So Ryan Bonham has been in touch with the DA all along.
509	00:30:27	00:30:28	He knew about the appeal.
510	00:30:28	00:30:33	He also knew that it had to be rescheduled because of Gary Lee Walt's surgery.
511	00:30:33	00:30:36	And he must have known that Jayson Walt was going to give his brother his kidney.
512	00:30:36	00:30:39	And he couldn't stand to see Gary Lee Walt saved.
513	00:30:39	00:30:41	Can't say I blame him.
514	00:30:41	00:30:44	So Ryan hires Jayson Walt to work his party.
515	00:30:44	00:30:49	He wants to get him alone, on his turf...
516	00:30:53	00:30:54	...except it's the wrong Santa.
517	00:30:54	00:30:55	Brad.
518	00:30:55	00:30:56	Ryan....?!
519	00:31:02	00:31:04	Ryan panics.
520	00:31:04	00:31:05	Can't believe what he's done.
521	00:31:05	00:31:08	Goes inside and gets rid of the evidence.
522	00:31:08	00:31:12	He runs back upstairs to be with his kid, wishing he could will it all away.
523	00:31:12	00:31:13	Me too.
524	00:31:13	00:31:17	'Cause now that kid's going to lose both his parents.
525	00:31:29	00:31:30	Las Vegas Police!
526	00:31:30	00:31:32	Ryan Bonham!
527	00:31:32	00:31:34	Go, go, go.
528	00:31:56	00:31:58	Whew...
529	00:31:58	00:31:59	Blake.
530	00:31:59	00:32:02	It's okay.
531	00:32:02	00:32:04	You're safe, son. I'm a policeman.
532	00:32:04	00:32:06	Some men came.
533	00:32:06	00:32:07	They took my daddy.
534	00:32:14	00:32:16	I heard Ryan Bonham's missing. What the hell happened to him?
535	00:32:16	00:32:18	Yeah, some guys broke in. They trashed the place.
536	00:32:18	00:32:20	I had a bad feeling.
537	00:32:20	00:32:21	When the fake Santa, Jayson Walt, made bail, he disappeared.
538	00:32:21	00:32:23	Bet he figured out Ryan tried to kill him?
539	00:32:23	00:32:26	That's a safe bet. And what about the kid, Blake?
540	00:32:26	00:32:29	Well, you know, he's okay. He's a little shaken up.
541	00:32:29	00:32:30	Yeah? Did he see anything? I don't know.
542	00:32:30	00:32:32	He'll only talk to one person.
543	00:32:32	00:32:34	Who?
544	00:32:34	00:32:35	Me?!
545	00:32:37	00:32:38	Last time I saw him, I scared him.
546	00:32:38	00:32:43	He said he wanted to talk to-- and I quote-- the funny science man.
547	00:32:43	00:32:45	A compliment, I suppose, but...
548	00:32:45	00:32:47	you got to help me out here.
549	00:32:47	00:32:49	Just relax. Engage him. Here.
550	00:32:49	00:32:51	Give him this. Chocolate.
551	00:32:51	00:32:52	Get him talking.
552	00:32:52	00:32:54	I'm sure he saw something.
553	00:32:54	00:32:56	This is a bad idea. I'm gonna screw this up.
554	00:32:56	00:32:59	Just, you know, give it your best shot.
555	00:33:23	00:33:25	Hey... little man.
556	00:33:25	00:33:26	Hi.
557	00:33:31	00:33:33	Sorry. I'm allergic.
558	00:33:33	00:33:36	Yeah. Me, too.
559	00:33:39	00:33:41	I like your watch.
560	00:33:41	00:33:43	I used to have one just like it.
561	00:33:43	00:33:45	It's purple. Good color.
562	00:33:45	00:33:47	And the diode display.
563	00:33:47	00:33:50	Groundbreaking technology for its day.
564	00:33:50	00:33:53	Not that you...
565	00:33:53	00:33:55	You're a science man, right?
566	00:33:55	00:33:57	You know big words.
567	00:33:57	00:34:00	Sure. I-I know some big words.
568	00:34:00	00:34:04	Did the people with your daddy use big words?
569	00:34:04	00:34:06	Uh-huh. Condestorb.
570	00:34:06	00:34:11	Condestorb? When they were going, one man yelled at the other man.
571	00:34:11	00:34:15	He was mad because he hadn't gotten his condestorb fixed.
572	00:34:15	00:34:17	Do you mean condenser?
573	00:34:17	00:34:19	Yeah! What is that?
574	00:34:19	00:34:22	It's a machine that helps freeze things.
575	00:34:24	00:34:26	Did you see the truck the men came in, Blake?
576	00:34:26	00:34:28	Yeah, when they drove up.
577	00:34:28	00:34:30	When my dad told me to hide.
578	00:34:30	00:34:32	And was it the same truck that was at the party at your house?
579	00:34:32	00:34:34	Uh-huh.
580	00:34:34	00:34:37	Will my daddy be okay?
581	00:34:39	00:34:45	As long as he knows what a great, smart son he has, he's gonna be just fine.
582	00:34:45	00:34:47	He's a very lucky daddy.
583	00:34:47	00:34:49	Thanks.
584	00:34:51	00:35:02	Traffic cam caught Jayson Walt's ice truck turning off I-15 onto 215 East one hour ago. I'm guessing that Ryan Bonham is in the back, on ice, and they're taking him out of town.
585	00:35:02	00:35:04	Yeah, but I don't get it. Why didn't they just kill him at the house?
586	00:35:04	00:35:06	Maybe Ryan has something they want.
587	00:35:06	00:35:09	So, where do you think they're going?
588	00:35:09	00:35:15	My guess is someplace isolated, where they feel safe... so they can rough him up.
589	00:35:15	00:35:17	Maybe...
590	00:35:17	00:35:19	where they make their ice.
591	00:35:19	00:35:21	Why do you say that?
592	00:35:21	00:35:26	Because when I analyzed the melted snow, there was no chlorine in the water.
593	00:35:26	00:35:29	And all of Las Vegas' tap water adds chlorine.
594	00:35:29	00:35:35	If I test the diatoms in the melted snow, I might be able to... pinpoint the water source.
595	00:35:35	00:35:37	Give us a location.
596	00:36:09	00:36:11	Hey.
597	00:36:11	00:36:15	So, that party snow came from a small lake near Henderson. So that's where the truck's going.
598	00:36:15	00:36:17	Yeah, I ran property records in Henderson.
599	00:36:17	00:36:21	Turns out the Walt brothers have had a warehouse there since the early '90s.
600	00:36:21	00:36:24	Good work, Greg. Well, I hope it's not too late.
601	00:36:27	00:36:31	Where's the box of bank records?
602	00:36:37	00:36:39	Stop it. Please stop! Stop.
603	00:36:39	00:36:41	I'll show you where it is.
604	00:36:41	00:36:42	No, you're gonna tell me where to find it!
605	00:36:42	00:36:44	I can't tell you where to find it!
606	00:36:44	00:36:45	Hold it, hold it, hold it. Hey, hey!
607	00:36:45	00:36:47	You a lefty or a righty, Ryan?
608	00:36:47	00:36:50	No. Wait. Aw, it doesn't matter anyway. Go on.
609	00:36:50	00:36:53	Power it up!
610	00:36:53	00:36:59	You know, cops said someone was trying to kill me-- Santa stabbed in the back at your house.
611	00:36:59	00:37:01	Pretty easy to figure out!
612	00:37:01	00:37:05	You know, the thing about this ice chipper, see, you're lucky if it only takes an arm.
613	00:37:05	00:37:09	Lot of times, once you get something in there, no turning back, Ryan!
614	00:37:09	00:37:11	Hey! You listening to me? Huh?
615	00:37:11	00:37:13	Last chance, Ryan!
616	00:37:13	00:37:15	I'm tired of waiting.
617	00:37:17	00:37:20	All right, if that's how you want it!
618	00:37:23	00:37:25	No...!
619	00:37:25	00:37:27	Las Vegas Police! Put down your weapons!
620	00:37:30	00:37:33	Back off or I put a bullet in his head!
621	00:37:33	00:37:34	Put the gun down, Jayson.
622	00:37:34	00:37:37	I will do it! Well, so will I.
623	00:37:37	00:37:39	I'll bust a cap right in your kidneys.
624	00:37:39	00:37:42	I'll kill you and your brother.
625	00:37:42	00:37:43	Put the gun down.
626	00:37:46	00:37:47	Shoot him!
627	00:37:49	00:37:50	They killed my wife!
628	00:37:50	00:37:51	Do it!
629	00:37:51	00:37:53	Put the gun down, Jayson.
630	00:38:15	00:38:17	You should've killed him.
631	00:38:17	00:38:19	Ryan Bonham, you're under arrest.
632	00:38:19	00:38:21	Get him out of here.
633	00:38:39	00:38:42	He made a full confession.
634	00:38:42	00:38:45	He admitted to killing Brad Fante by mistake.
635	00:38:45	00:38:47	He's lucky Jayson Walt didn't kill him.
636	00:38:47	00:38:49	He saw them coming. He told his kid to hide.
637	00:38:49	00:38:55	Then when they busted in, he somehow convinced Jayson Walt that his wife had bank records that would incriminate both him and his brother.
638	00:38:55	00:38:57	There were no records.
639	00:38:57	00:38:59	Buying time.
640	00:38:59	00:39:01	Till we could find his kid. Well...
641	00:39:01	00:39:04	losing your wife like that...
642	00:39:06	00:39:08	Anyway...
643	00:39:08	00:39:11	Oh, there's been a little mix-up in Jayson Walt's custody.
644	00:39:11	00:39:18	A Henderson, Nevada, sheriff showed up-- he's a friend-- and I handed Jayson Walt over to him.
645	00:39:18	00:39:21	The weird thing is that his wristband number got transposed.
646	00:39:21	00:39:22	He got on the wrong bus.
647	00:39:22	00:39:24	Where is he now?
648	00:39:24	00:39:26	He's shuffling off to Buffalo.
649	00:39:26	00:39:28	Unbelievable, isn't it? The red tape.
650	00:39:28	00:39:31	Could take months for him to get back to Las Vegas.
651	00:39:31	00:39:35	Well, I guess he won't be giving his brother his kidney tomorrow, will he?
652	00:39:35	00:39:38	It's tragic, isn't it?
653	00:39:38	00:39:47	So, there are some people who will be here soon, very nice people, and, um, they're going to take you to see your grandparents, okay? Okay.
654	00:39:50	00:39:56	You know, Blake, um, this thing with you father, I'm sure it's hard for you to understand.
655	00:39:56	00:39:58	He misses my mom.
656	00:39:58	00:40:00	I'm sure he does.
657	00:40:00	00:40:02	I do, too.
658	00:40:05	00:40:07	Have you ever read The Lost Reindeer?
659	00:40:07	00:40:10	I've only heard the first part.
660	00:40:10	00:40:12	I always wondered what happened to that reindeer.
661	00:40:14	00:40:16	We can skip to the end.
662	00:40:18	00:40:22	Winston turned the corner and what did he see?
663	00:40:22	00:40:28	A hundred reindeer just as lost as he.
664	00:40:39	00:40:44	They laughed and sang until night faded away.
665	00:40:52	00:41:00	As long as they had each other, every moment was Christmas Day.
666	00:41:00	00:41:02	The end.
