0	00:00:50	00:00:53	A truck driver making a delivery found him.
1	00:00:55	00:00:56	T.O.D.?
2	00:00:56	00:00:57	About two or three hours ago.
3	00:00:58	00:01:01	Neck contusion.
4	00:01:03	00:01:04	Looks like he went down fighting.
5	00:01:04	00:01:06	Any ID?
6	00:01:06	00:01:08	Just this.
7	00:01:11	00:01:13	Palermo room key.
8	00:01:13	00:01:14	Nice clothes.
9	00:01:14	00:01:15	Well, they do make the man.
10	00:01:15	00:01:19	He's got some kind of transfer on his pants.
11	00:01:19	00:01:21	Yeah, and on his shirt.
12	00:01:21	00:01:27	So what's a guy dressed for a party with a key to this hotel doing out here?
13	00:01:27	00:01:28	I don't know.
14	00:01:29	00:01:30	But the party's over.
15	00:02:05	00:02:07	Got smudges that look like white paint up here.
16	00:02:07	00:02:10	Similar to the trace on the vic's clothes.
17	00:02:10	00:02:12	Same down here.
18	00:02:12	00:02:16	So whatever it is, it must have been wet.
19	00:02:27	00:02:32	I don't see any wet paint signs up here either.
20	00:03:17	00:03:23	Two performances nightly of Palermo's fabulous show, The Girls of India.
21	00:03:23	00:03:28	Now on display at Palermo Jewelers-- Diamonds at Romanoff's.
22	00:03:35	00:03:38	The room is registered to a Jeffrey Powell of Van Nuys, California.
23	00:03:38	00:03:40	He check in with anybody?
24	00:03:40	00:03:41	No. The reservation was for one person.
25	00:03:41	00:03:45	He checked in yesterday, paid with a corporate credit card.
26	00:03:45	00:03:46	Do you remember the name of the company?
27	00:03:46	00:03:48	Sheritown Inc.
28	00:03:48	00:03:49	Sheritown Inc.
29	00:03:49	00:03:53	We're going to need access to all of the surveillance footage from tonight, all right?
30	00:03:53	00:03:55	You got it. Okay.
31	00:03:59	00:04:01	Two glasses.
32	00:04:01	00:04:03	Think our vic got lucky?
33	00:04:03	00:04:06	Oh, yeah.
34	00:04:08	00:04:10	He got lucky, all right.
35	00:04:10	00:04:13	He got lucky with a blonde.
36	00:04:18	00:04:19	Jeans...
37	00:04:19	00:04:21	full of holes.
38	00:04:21	00:04:24	Must have been wearing them a long time.
39	00:04:24	00:04:27	Either that or he just bought them an paid a fortune.
40	00:04:27	00:04:30	I remember my first time to Vegas.
41	00:04:30	00:04:34	I got one of these-- Guide to blackjack.
42	00:04:34	00:04:38	Everybody dreams of hitting it big out here, don't they?
43	00:04:38	00:04:41	Yeah, well, if that ever ends you can kiss Vegas good-bye.
44	00:04:43	00:04:45	We have a winner.
45	00:04:47	00:04:49	Jackpot.
46	00:04:49	00:04:51	Ooh, Sasan.
47	00:04:51	00:04:54	Cost him more than all of his other clothes put together.
48	00:04:54	00:04:59	There's some kind of blue powder trace on the pocket.
49	00:05:00	00:05:02	Nicky, take this.
50	00:05:04	00:05:07	California driver's license.
51	00:05:07	00:05:11	Company credit card.
52	00:05:11	00:05:14	Amateur Speedway Association card.
53	00:05:14	00:05:16	Guy liked fast cars.
54	00:05:19	00:05:22	Except he was driving a Toyota.
55	00:05:22	00:05:23	No cash.
56	00:05:23	00:05:26	This sounds like a classic trick roll.
57	00:05:26	00:05:29	Kid from out of town on a lucky streak-- I cannot lose tonight!
58	00:05:29	00:05:32	he's an easy mark.
59	00:05:32	00:05:35	Get him up to the room...
60	00:05:35	00:05:38	loosen him up...
61	00:05:38	00:05:40	jump him and dump him.
62	00:05:53	00:05:56	Mom was right-- always wear clean ones.
63	00:05:56	00:05:58	Because you never know what could happen.
64	00:05:58	00:05:59	What do you think that is?
65	00:05:59	00:06:00	Why don't you take a whiff?
66	00:06:00	00:06:03	Why am I always the guy who has to sniff the shorts?
67	00:06:03	00:06:04	'Cause it's your job.
68	00:06:04	00:06:06	You do it.
69	00:06:11	00:06:13	Red wine.
70	00:06:15	00:06:17	It's not on his pants.
71	00:06:17	00:06:19	What about the shirt?
72	00:06:19	00:06:21	No.
73	00:06:21	00:06:23	So he must have changed after the mess.
74	00:06:23	00:06:25	Oh, I already went through his pockets.
75	00:06:29	00:06:31	Of course, I was double-gloved.
76	00:06:31	00:06:33	Clothes are brand new.
77	00:06:37	00:06:38	Hmm...
78	00:06:38	00:06:41	Looks like a callus.
79	00:06:44	00:06:46	There's a long-haired blonde.
80	00:06:46	00:06:49	Yeah, I've been watching this for a while now.
81	00:06:49	00:06:52	52 p.m.
82	00:06:52	00:06:55	He entered his room a couple of minutes later.
83	00:06:55	00:06:59	Manager said the last time he used his card key 54 p.m.
84	00:06:59	00:07:03	We look forward about an hour...
85	00:07:03	00:07:06	Jeff leaves his room alone.
86	00:07:06	00:07:08	He doesn't have a jacket on.
87	00:07:08	00:07:10	He's probably not going too far.
88	00:07:10	00:07:18	So he gets off the elevator, goes into the casino, and nine minutes later, same blonde goes down in the elevator.
89	00:07:18	00:07:20	Mm-hmm.
90	00:07:20	00:07:22	Grab that.
91	00:07:22	00:07:24	Print that.
92	00:07:26	00:07:31	After the vic gets off the elevator, I lose him in the casino crowd for about 15 minutes.
93	00:07:31	00:07:33	How do you lose him?
94	00:07:33	00:07:34	Aren't there a hundred cameras in there?
95	00:07:34	00:07:38	And at four hours of video each, that's 400 hours of video I got to go through.
96	00:07:39	00:07:43	The vic was found at the loading dock off the shopping arcade.
97	00:07:43	00:07:45	He's heading for the arcade here.
98	00:07:45	00:07:48	That's the last time I've got him on camera.
99	00:07:48	00:07:49	There's no surveillance in the arcade hall.
100	00:07:49	00:07:51	Only in the individual stores.
101	00:07:51	00:07:53	Freeze that.
102	00:07:53	00:07:56	Enhance that bag.
103	00:07:56	00:08:00	The vic was wearing a Sasan jacket.
104	00:08:01	00:08:04	There's a Sasan boutique in the arcade.
105	00:08:04	00:08:06	I'm going shopping.
106	00:08:06	00:08:09	But you were working last night.
107	00:08:09	00:08:12	Yeah, we've been short-handed.
108	00:08:12	00:08:16	Do you, uh, do you recognize either one of these people?
109	00:08:18	00:08:19	No. Sorry.
110	00:08:21	00:08:23	How about this?
111	00:08:24	00:08:25	Recognize that?
112	00:08:25	00:08:27	Sure. That's from the new Spring line.
113	00:08:27	00:08:30	The leather's like skin. It's incredible.
114	00:08:30	00:08:32	Show me that picture again.
115	00:08:35	00:08:37	Now I remember.
116	00:08:37	00:08:39	He bought a whole outfit.
117	00:08:39	00:08:41	Even wanted underwear.
118	00:08:41	00:08:42	We don't sell underwear.
119	00:08:42	00:08:45	Credit card receipt, anything like that?
120	00:08:45	00:08:46	He paid cash.
121	00:08:46	00:08:47	He was flashing a wad.
122	00:08:47	00:08:50	Mm-hmm. Buy anything for her?
123	00:08:50	00:08:52	Nothing.
124	00:08:52	00:08:53	She didn't need anything.
125	00:08:53	00:08:55	Looked perfect.
126	00:08:55	00:08:56	Was making my job real easy.
127	00:09:02	00:09:05	That guy would have bought anything she wanted him to, Mr. Stokes.
128	00:09:08	00:09:10	Thank you.
129	00:09:29	00:09:37	I found extensive contusion involving the anterior aspect of the neck with hemorrhage in all the strap muscles.
130	00:09:37	00:09:42	The thyroid, cricoid and arytenoid cartilages are all multiply fractured.
131	00:09:46	00:09:48	The hyoid bone is fractured as well.
132	00:09:48	00:09:50	The blunt-force trauma to the neck?
133	00:09:50	00:09:54	Yeah. COD is asphyxiation due to obstruction of the airway.
134	00:09:54	00:09:56	Took a few minutes to die.
135	00:09:56	00:09:58	Any idea of the source of the BFT?
136	00:09:58	00:10:02	Well, I enhanced the contusion on the neck using UV photography.
137	00:10:02	00:10:06	Looks like there's a defined edge on the weapon.
138	00:10:06	00:10:08	Yeah, that could be anything.
139	00:10:08	00:10:11	How about prelim tox results?
140	00:10:11	00:10:16	Well, tox detected methamphetamine, sildenafil and oxycodone.
141	00:10:16	00:10:19	Stimulant, erection and a painkiller.
142	00:10:19	00:10:20	Party in a pill.
143	00:10:20	00:10:22	Where was that on my wedding night?
144	00:10:25	00:10:27	Does this couple look familiar?
145	00:10:27	00:10:29	Sweet red Ferrari. F-360 Spyder.
146	00:10:29	00:10:30	When did you see them?
147	00:10:30	00:10:32	Last night-- I brought the car when they left.
148	00:10:32	00:10:34	15.
149	00:10:34	00:10:35	They're gone a couple hours.
150	00:10:35	00:10:36	The car-- pfft-- was amazing.
151	00:10:36	00:10:38	Did they happen to tell you where they were going?
152	00:10:38	00:10:39	No.
153	00:10:39	00:10:41	Do you know what time they got back to the hotel?
154	00:10:41	00:10:43	00.
155	00:10:43	00:10:44	The guy gave me a Benjamin.
156	00:10:44	00:10:47	I kept an eye out on that baby, I didn't want any of these other maniacs putting their paws on it.
157	00:10:48	00:10:50	What about the girl?
158	00:10:50	00:10:51	You ever seen her before?
159	00:10:51	00:10:53	I don't think so.
160	00:10:53	00:10:55	She strike you as a working girl?
161	00:10:55	00:10:59	I'll say this, if she was hooking, then she was top shelf, just like that car.
162	00:10:59	00:11:02	I felt kind of like that garage guy in Ferris Bueller's Day Off?
163	00:11:02	00:11:07	You know, he likes the car so much, he takes it out for a spin for, like, the whole day.
164	00:11:07	00:11:08	Not that I'd ever do that.
165	00:11:08	00:11:10	Of course not.
166	00:11:10	00:11:13	Whoa, look, I had nothing to do with the damage on that car.
167	00:11:16	00:11:18	I mean, it was pristine before they took it out.
168	00:11:18	00:11:21	They were in an accident? How bad?
169	00:11:21	00:11:24	Look, any scratch on that beauty is a tragedy.
170	00:11:24	00:11:26	And this was, like, a dent.
171	00:11:26	00:11:27	You know what? They looked like they didn't even care.
172	00:11:28	00:11:29	Anything else I can do for you?
173	00:11:30	00:11:31	Um, thanks.
174	00:11:31	00:11:34	Lenny. Lenny Andretti.
175	00:11:34	00:11:35	No relation.
176	00:11:35	00:11:39	The trace for your vic's jacket pocket was primarily talc.
177	00:11:39	00:11:41	Blue baby powder?
178	00:11:41	00:11:44	No. Take a look.
179	00:11:44	00:11:47	Birefringent crystals.
180	00:11:47	00:11:50	Pretty. What are they?
181	00:11:50	00:11:53	It's a mixture of silica and axolite, two abrasives.
182	00:11:53	00:11:56	But when found with talc, it suggests only one use.
183	00:11:57	00:11:59	And that would be?
184	00:11:59	00:12:05	In 1897, William Spinks received a patent for what came to be known as Spinks Billiard Chalk.
185	00:12:06	00:12:13	You may be surprised to know that cue-tip chalk does not contain chalk at all, it is a mixture of axolite and silica.
186	00:12:13	00:12:17	The abrasives give grip to the tip when it hits the ball.
187	00:12:18	00:12:20	Stop trying to make that sound dirty.
188	00:12:20	00:12:23	Out vic had a callus on his hand. Mm...
189	00:12:23	00:12:25	Don't.
190	00:12:25	00:12:26	Which means that he was probably playing a lot of pool.
191	00:12:27	00:12:31	Where do you go in this town to shoot stick with a hot blonde and a Ferrari?
192	00:12:35	00:12:39	There's at least a half a dozen of these high-end pool halls in Vegas.
193	00:12:39	00:12:43	The word on the street is a lot of out-of-town money comes through here.
194	00:12:43	00:12:46	Well, it's closer to Palermo, it's a good place to start.
195	00:13:04	00:13:06	Hey, buddy, how's it going?
196	00:13:06	00:13:08	Have these two been in lately?
197	00:13:09	00:13:11	No.
198	00:13:11	00:13:14	It's pretty dark in here, wouldn't recognize my own mom if she came in.
199	00:13:14	00:13:17	It wasn't so dark you couldn't count your vig from that game over there.
200	00:13:17	00:13:19	It's not illegal to bet on a pool game in Nevada.
201	00:13:19	00:13:22	But it is illegal for the house to take a cut without a gaming license.
202	00:13:22	00:13:25	I don't see one on the wall.
203	00:13:25	00:13:28	That's because nothing like that's going on here.
204	00:13:28	00:13:32	So, if we asked everyone in here, no one would say that you're taking a piece of the action?
205	00:13:33	00:13:34	Let me take another look.
206	00:13:34	00:13:35	Sure. Knock yourself out.
207	00:13:36	00:13:37	I never seen the guy.
208	00:13:37	00:13:38	Girl's kind of a regular here.
209	00:13:39	00:13:40	Name's Heidi.
210	00:13:40	00:13:42	So, I guess your eyes do get used to the dark.
211	00:13:42	00:13:44	You know where we can find this Heidi?
212	00:13:44	00:13:45	Oh, man...
213	00:13:45	00:13:47	You know, I don't see that license anywhere.
214	00:13:47	00:13:48	Look, here's what we're going to do.
215	00:13:48	00:13:49	Get on the phone.
216	00:13:49	00:13:50	Call Heidi.
217	00:13:50	00:13:54	Tell her a distinguished gentleman has just come in with a large wad of cash looking for some action.
218	00:13:54	00:13:55	That'd be me.
219	00:14:05	00:14:06	Heidi Wolff?
220	00:14:06	00:14:08	How you doing?
221	00:14:08	00:14:10	I'm Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.
222	00:14:10	00:14:11	Can I talk to you for a minute?
223	00:14:11	00:14:12	About what?
224	00:14:13	00:14:14	Do you know this guy?
225	00:14:15	00:14:16	No.
226	00:14:16	00:14:18	Apparently, you think I do.
227	00:14:19	00:14:20	Oh, I know you do.
228	00:14:20	00:14:22	You want to tell me how he turned up dead?
229	00:14:29	00:14:31	So you spent the night with Jeff Powell.
230	00:14:31	00:14:33	And he was alive when he left me.
231	00:14:34	00:14:35	Oh. He left you?
232	00:14:35	00:14:38	Yeah. Believe it or not.
233	00:14:38	00:14:39	Look.
234	00:14:39	00:14:42	He was getting kind of weird on me.
235	00:14:45	00:14:46	Hey.
236	00:14:46	00:14:47	Where you going?
237	00:14:47	00:14:49	Don't worry, I'll be right back.
238	00:14:49	00:14:52	You know, I think I may just have to fall in love with you.
239	00:14:56	00:15:00	So I put on my clothes and I got out of there.
240	00:15:00	00:15:04	I was looking for fun, not a lifetime commitment.
241	00:15:04	00:15:06	Is that what you call fun?
242	00:15:06	00:15:07	Rolling a guy, taking his money?
243	00:15:07	00:15:09	I didn't take his money.
244	00:15:09	00:15:11	Heidi, Heidi, ho.
245	00:15:14	00:15:17	Look, we know Jeff was waving around a large wedge of cash.
246	00:15:17	00:15:20	And the money was gone when we found him.
247	00:15:20	00:15:22	You're an expensive date, Heidi.
248	00:15:22	00:15:24	I'm a professional gambler.
249	00:15:24	00:15:27	Probably the only one in Vegas who declares every dollar.
250	00:15:27	00:15:28	You can check my tax returns.
251	00:15:28	00:15:31	We checked the hotel sheets.
252	00:15:33	00:15:34	We had sex.
253	00:15:34	00:15:36	Is that against the law? No.
254	00:15:36	00:15:38	No.
255	00:15:38	00:15:39	We won some money shooting pool.
256	00:15:39	00:15:42	Is that against the law? No.
257	00:15:42	00:15:43	You gave him drugs.
258	00:15:43	00:15:44	Is that against the law?
259	00:15:47	00:15:48	Yeah.
260	00:15:48	00:15:51	Look, here's the way I see it breaking down.
261	00:15:51	00:15:54	You left the room nine minutes after he did.
262	00:15:54	00:15:55	You went downstairs.
263	00:15:55	00:15:57	You checked with your partner.
264	00:15:57	00:16:01	You killed the kid, you took the cash, end of story.
265	00:16:01	00:16:03	Let's get this straight.
266	00:16:03	00:16:07	He was a sweet kid and I'm sorry he's dead, but I had nothing to do with it.
267	00:16:07	00:16:09	And I'm done talking.
268	00:16:09	00:16:16	According to the DMV, of the 12 Ferrari F-360 Spyders registered in Vegas, only three are red.
269	00:16:16	00:16:18	Two of them are privately owned, and a rental company has the third.
270	00:16:18	00:16:21	Since the vic owns a Toyota in L.A.
271	00:16:21	00:16:22	and Heidi Wolff drives a Beetle...
272	00:16:23	00:16:25	You figured this would be a good place to start.
273	00:16:25	00:16:27	Welcome to Extravagant Auto.
274	00:16:27	00:16:28	Robert Rhoda.
275	00:16:28	00:16:31	If what you're dreaming about's on four wheels, I can get it for you.
276	00:16:31	00:16:33	Actually, we're looking for a red Ferrari Spyder.
277	00:16:33	00:16:35	The lady likes fast cars.
278	00:16:35	00:16:36	And I just happen to have one.
279	00:16:36	00:16:41	But it got into a little fender-bender, so it's going to take a day or so to get it fixed.
280	00:16:43	00:16:45	We'll take it as is.
281	00:16:46	00:16:49	Looks like paint transfer on the left rear quarter.
282	00:16:49	00:16:52	Clear coat's been peeled front-to-back.
283	00:16:52	00:16:55	Which means the Ferrari was the faster vehicle.
284	00:16:55	00:16:57	The Ferrari is always the faster vehicle.
285	00:17:02	00:17:03	Ooh.
286	00:17:03	00:17:07	Nice dent to the front bumper.
287	00:17:07	00:17:09	You're looking at $15,000 of damage there.
288	00:17:09	00:17:10	Who rented it?
289	00:17:10	00:17:12	Can't help you with that.
290	00:17:12	00:17:14	Our customer records are confidential.
291	00:17:15	00:17:17	In any case, we're not making a police report about the damage.
292	00:17:17	00:17:20	No need to, we're impounding it.
293	00:17:21	00:17:22	What?
294	00:17:22	00:17:25	Looks like the interior's been cleaned.
295	00:17:25	00:17:28	I'll call auto transport and have them tow it back to the lot.
296	00:17:30	00:17:31	Mr. Rhoda, what are you doing?
297	00:17:31	00:17:34	I'm documenting my loss.
298	00:17:34	00:17:37	I'm filing for crime victim compensation.
299	00:18:49	00:18:50	Grissom?
300	00:18:50	00:18:55	Hodges confirmed the paint transfer on the Ferrari is a black acrylic enamel.
301	00:18:55	00:18:56	That doesn't narrow it down much.
302	00:18:56	00:18:57	Well, it gets better.
303	00:18:57	00:19:01	It's a GM paint, with traces of fiberglass reinforced plastic.
304	00:19:01	00:19:03	Which means, we're looking for a black Corvette.
305	00:19:03	00:19:05	I'll have Brass put out a broadcast.
306	00:19:05	00:19:07	Nick ran the vic's credit card.
307	00:19:07	00:19:11	Sheritown, Inc. is based in L.A., run by a guy named Mick Sheridan.
308	00:19:11	00:19:13	I'm going to meet him at the P.D.
309	00:19:13	00:19:14	Mick Sheridan the movie producer?
310	00:19:15	00:19:19	I grew up watching his action blockbusters-- car chases, ninjas, cyborg death machines.
311	00:19:19	00:19:25	We used to make body armor out of tinfoil, and re-enact the scenes all over the neighborhood.
312	00:19:25	00:19:26	What about you, you were a Green Beret kid?
313	00:19:27	00:19:27	Secret agent?
314	00:19:28	00:19:28	I'm not telling.
315	00:19:29	00:19:30	And stay away from my tinfoil.
316	00:19:34	00:19:37	I'm sick about this.
317	00:19:37	00:19:40	Of all kids.
318	00:19:40	00:19:42	Jeff.
319	00:19:42	00:19:44	I can't stop crying.
320	00:19:44	00:19:46	You want something to drink?
321	00:19:46	00:19:47	Oh, thanks, uh...
322	00:19:47	00:19:51	Small Pellegrino, room temperature.
323	00:19:51	00:19:52	Sure thing.
324	00:19:56	00:20:00	Mr. Sheridan, can you tell us anything about this girl?
325	00:20:02	00:20:03	I don't know her.
326	00:20:03	00:20:05	Jeff must have met her here.
327	00:20:07	00:20:10	I loved him like a son.
328	00:20:10	00:20:12	Smart. Hard-working.
329	00:20:12	00:20:14	I hired him right out of law school.
330	00:20:14	00:20:16	What kind of work did he do for you?
331	00:20:16	00:20:18	An assistant.
332	00:20:18	00:20:22	He wanted to learn the movie business from the bottom up, like I did.
333	00:20:22	00:20:25	Oh, right, you used to be an actor.
334	00:20:25	00:20:29	Yeah. But I had a nasty habit-- I wanted to eat regularly.
335	00:20:29	00:20:31	And didn't want to work as a waiter to do it.
336	00:20:31	00:20:34	Did Jeff have any nasty habits?
337	00:20:36	00:20:40	We found several different drugs in his bloodstream.
338	00:20:40	00:20:43	What was Jeff doing in Las Vegas?
339	00:20:43	00:20:53	Um... About a month ago, when he was making copies of my divorce settlement, he spotted a provision that my wife's lawyer had rephrased.
340	00:20:53	00:20:54	My lawyers had missed it.
341	00:20:54	00:20:57	He saved me millions of dollars.
342	00:20:57	00:20:59	So to thank him, I gave him a vacation.
343	00:20:59	00:21:01	You give him any cash?
344	00:21:01	00:21:04	Couple hundred bucks, corporate credit card.
345	00:21:04	00:21:07	Told him to have fun.
346	00:21:07	00:21:08	Fun, huh?
347	00:21:08	00:21:11	Yeah.
348	00:21:11	00:21:14	I'll be regretting that for the rest of my life.
349	00:21:19	00:21:21	I guess the broadcast paid off.
350	00:21:21	00:21:22	Black Corvette.
351	00:21:22	00:21:25	Parking enforcement found it abandoned off Durango near Russell.
352	00:21:25	00:21:28	Right between the pool hall and the Palermo?
353	00:21:28	00:21:29	Yup.
354	00:21:31	00:21:33	This would have been impossible to drive away.
355	00:21:33	00:21:35	Yeah.
356	00:21:35	00:21:37	Bummer.
357	00:21:37	00:21:42	Please tell me there's something more to this guys and cars thing beside the obvious penis extension metaphors.
358	00:21:42	00:21:44	So you want me to lie?
359	00:21:53	00:21:55	Red paint transfer.
360	00:22:04	00:22:06	I'll get a sample to Hodges.
361	00:22:06	00:22:09	See if he can match it to the Ferrari.
362	00:22:13	00:22:15	It's a rental.
363	00:22:15	00:22:17	Extravagant Automobiles?
364	00:22:17	00:22:19	No. Zenith?
365	00:22:19	00:22:22	Yeah, night to be in the car rental business.
366	00:22:22	00:22:24	Driver's name is Randy Bolen.
367	00:22:24	00:22:26	Local address.
368	00:22:26	00:22:29	Let's go talk to him.
369	00:22:32	00:22:35	Randy Bolen.
370	00:22:35	00:22:40	Misdemeanor possession, assault, felony possession for sales...
371	00:22:42	00:22:45	You can't help but break the law, can you?
372	00:22:47	00:22:49	What's with the forehead?
373	00:22:52	00:22:56	Well, you got that bruise somehow.
374	00:22:56	00:23:00	Want me to add leaving the scene of an accident to the list?
375	00:23:01	00:23:04	It was a fender bender. Not my fault.
376	00:23:04	00:23:05	Sure about that?
377	00:23:05	00:23:07	Yeah.
378	00:23:07	00:23:11	Because your car and the Ferrari were both rented.
379	00:23:11	00:23:13	So what? It's a coincidence.
380	00:23:13	00:23:15	You're a local. Why did you need to rent a car?
381	00:23:15	00:23:19	I can't afford one all the time, so I rent one when I can.
382	00:23:19	00:23:23	What were you doing all night before your fender bender?
383	00:23:23	00:23:25	What was I doing? I was shooting pool.
384	00:23:25	00:23:28	Place called The... The Cue-T.
385	00:23:28	00:23:30	How'd you play? Did you win any money?
386	00:23:30	00:23:32	You know, you win some, you lose some.
387	00:23:53	00:23:55	I guess that would be lose some.
388	00:23:55	00:23:57	How much?
389	00:24:00	00:24:02	Ten grand.
390	00:24:02	00:24:05	That's a lot of money for a guy like you.
391	00:24:13	00:24:16	I've had worse nights.
392	00:24:17	00:24:19	Yeah, I'm sure you have.
393	00:24:19	00:24:21	You're having one now.
394	00:24:22	00:24:23	These the guys you played?
395	00:24:27	00:24:29	Yeah.
396	00:24:29	00:24:36	Now, there's a coincidence, because they were in the Ferrari, which makes you a very sore loser.
397	00:25:00	00:25:02	Okay.
398	00:25:02	00:25:04	So I rubbed him a little.
399	00:25:04	00:25:06	It was a stupid thing to do.
400	00:25:06	00:25:08	Not as stupid as killing him.
401	00:25:09	00:25:12	What, that kid-- he's dead?
402	00:25:12	00:25:14	Yeah.
403	00:25:18	00:25:21	I want a lawyer.
404	00:25:21	00:25:24	According to his record, Randy Bolen used to be a professional stunt driver.
405	00:25:24	00:25:26	Must not have been a very good one.
406	00:25:26	00:25:31	He teaches at that track off Boulder Highway where middle-aged guys get to act out their Grand Prix fantasies.
407	00:25:31	00:25:32	Mm-hmm, okay.
408	00:25:32	00:25:37	A guy like that gets beat by a punk kid on the street, it's gonna be an assault on his manhood.
409	00:25:37	00:25:38	He's got a temper.
410	00:25:39	00:25:41	Okay. I'll see if I can place him at the hotel.
411	00:25:41	00:25:42	I'll let you know.
412	00:25:43	00:25:44	Hey, Arch. Hey.
413	00:25:44	00:25:46	Surveillance footage from the Palermo?
414	00:25:46	00:25:48	Yeah.
415	00:25:48	00:25:50	I just found something really interesting.
416	00:25:50	00:25:53	That's the blonde from the elevator.
417	00:25:53	00:25:55	There she is again.
418	00:25:55	00:25:58	And here's Jeff Powell.
419	00:25:58	00:26:01	This is where his evening begins, when he meets her for the first time.
420	00:26:03	00:26:05	Ooh.
421	00:26:05	00:26:07	She didn't look too happy.
422	00:26:07	00:26:08	Yeah.
423	00:26:08	00:26:11	Keep watching when she points at something.
424	00:26:11	00:26:14	Keep your eyes on her wine.
425	00:26:21	00:26:24	You think that was on purpose?
426	00:26:24	00:26:26	Well, sure looks that way.
427	00:26:26	00:26:28	Take a look at this.
428	00:26:29	00:26:31	Girl was loaded.
429	00:26:31	00:26:35	It's safe to say she wasn't after him for his money.
430	00:26:35	00:26:37	Hey.
431	00:26:37	00:26:38	Hey.
432	00:26:38	00:26:41	Warrants came through on the rental agreements.
433	00:26:41	00:26:46	Jeff Powell went a little crazy with his corporate card and rented the Ferrari himself?
434	00:26:46	00:26:48	No. Heidi Wolff rented it.
435	00:26:48	00:26:52	The reservation was held in her name by a company called Caprice Unlimited.
436	00:26:52	00:26:53	This is where it gets interesting.
437	00:26:53	00:26:57	Caprice Unlimited also rented Randy Bolen's Corvette.
438	00:26:57	00:26:59	What kind of business is it?
439	00:26:59	00:27:01	All I know so far is that they're unlisted.
440	00:27:01	00:27:05	Well, nothing's entirely unlisted these days.
441	00:27:05	00:27:08	Caprice Unlimited.
442	00:27:08	00:27:10	Mm-hmm.
443	00:27:13	00:27:16	Caprice Unlimited.
444	00:27:16	00:27:19	Anything is possible.
445	00:27:19	00:27:21	Sounds like a sex business.
446	00:27:21	00:27:25	What are you going to say?
447	00:27:25	00:27:29	Uh, something other than, A guy is dead, and it looks like you're involved.
448	00:27:29	00:27:31	You've reached Caprice Unlimited.
449	00:27:31	00:27:35	Leave a message; we shall call you.
450	00:27:35	00:27:37	Not taking calls.
451	00:27:37	00:27:40	Let's see if they're making any.
452	00:28:04	00:28:06	Triangulation's consistent.
453	00:28:06	00:28:10	Caprice Unlimited made the calls from this address.
454	00:28:10	00:28:16	According to the building owner, Caprice is only renting it for two days.
455	00:28:39	00:28:41	No, not quite.
456	00:28:44	00:28:46	Oh, yes.
457	00:28:46	00:28:48	Perfect.
458	00:28:48	00:28:53	You two, go get your costumes and find out what's expected of you.
459	00:28:53	00:28:55	Why don't you wait for me inside?
460	00:28:59	00:29:01	This is a private residence.
461	00:29:02	00:29:03	My name is Gil Grissom, this is Sara Sidle.
462	00:29:04	00:29:05	We're with the Crime Lab.
463	00:29:05	00:29:06	Anthony Caprice.
464	00:29:07	00:29:08	There's no crime here.
465	00:29:09	00:29:10	That was a job interview.
466	00:29:10	00:29:12	Over $150,000 has been spent on this event.
467	00:29:12	00:29:14	It's for several golf club salesman.
468	00:29:14	00:29:16	They're from Kansas City.
469	00:29:16	00:29:21	Japanese formality will mesh very nicely with their inherent Midwestern restraint.
470	00:29:21	00:29:27	Their idealized woman-- submissive, but in control-- becomes the geisha.
471	00:29:29	00:29:30	I get it.
472	00:29:30	00:29:34	You're one of those companies that stages fantasies, right?
473	00:29:34	00:29:37	Everything appears real, but it's all been worked out in advance?
474	00:29:37	00:29:41	These scenarios take weeks to craft.
475	00:29:41	00:29:48	I learn everything about my client's wants and his desires, all without him even knowing.
476	00:29:48	00:29:53	Secret longings-- they have a... a kind of electricity.
477	00:29:54	00:29:58	They're often much more visible than we would want them to be.
478	00:29:58	00:30:06	And, uh, Jeff Powell's evening-- the girl, the car, the billiards-- all paid for by Mick Sheridan?
479	00:30:07	00:30:08	Never heard of him.
480	00:30:08	00:30:09	Who did pay?
481	00:30:10	00:30:11	A benefactor.
482	00:30:11	00:30:13	Wishes to remain anonymous.
483	00:30:13	00:30:16	Somebody rich who likes to manipulate people probably.
484	00:30:16	00:30:18	Everybody likes to be in control.
485	00:30:19	00:30:20	You don't have to be rich to want that.
486	00:30:22	00:30:26	If you're so law-abiding, why did Heidi Wolff and Randy Bolen lie to the police about what happened?
487	00:30:26	00:30:28	Did you tell them to do that?
488	00:30:28	00:30:35	All my employees have a very strict non-disclosure agreement that they have to sign, although, I'd never expect them to lie to the police.
489	00:30:35	00:30:37	Maybe you just asked them the wrong questions.
490	00:30:37	00:30:40	Here's a copy of Mr. Powell's scenario.
491	00:30:40	00:30:47	Every event that they talked about was meticulously planned in advance and timed down to the minute.
492	00:30:47	00:30:49	And his murder?
493	00:30:49	00:30:51	Tragic.
494	00:30:51	00:30:53	But it's not in my script.
495	00:30:55	00:30:58	Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a hot tub to calibrate.
496	00:30:58	00:31:00	Oh.
497	00:31:01	00:31:05	And may all your dreams come true.
498	00:31:10	00:31:13	Well, I hope this means you know what happened to Jeff.
499	00:31:13	00:31:18	That's the first time that the tower yanked back my Gulfstream on takeoff.
500	00:31:18	00:31:19	No kidding.
501	00:31:19	00:31:20	Well, there's always a first for everything.
502	00:31:20	00:31:22	We can talk in here.
503	00:31:22	00:31:24	Something wrong with your office?
504	00:31:24	00:31:26	No.
505	00:31:28	00:31:32	You seem to have bad luck with the people who work for you.
506	00:31:32	00:31:36	If that's a joke, it's in pretty poor taste.
507	00:31:36	00:31:40	Three years ago, you were busted with an eight ball of cocaine in your luggage.
508	00:31:40	00:31:42	You claimed that your personal assistant had planted it.
509	00:31:42	00:31:44	That's because he did.
510	00:31:44	00:31:47	The charges against me were dropped.
511	00:31:47	00:31:49	The poor kid had a serious problem.
512	00:31:49	00:31:51	I got him into a program.
513	00:31:51	00:31:52	Understand he's doing better now.
514	00:31:52	00:31:56	I hear you bought him a car to shut him up and take the rap.
515	00:31:56	00:31:58	The media spins every...
516	00:32:00	00:32:02	The media.
517	00:32:04	00:32:07	We found an ounce of cocaine in Jeff Powell's personal effects.
518	00:32:07	00:32:08	He was buying drugs for you.
519	00:32:08	00:32:11	I don't do drugs.
520	00:32:11	00:32:14	And I had no idea that Jeff had a drug problem.
521	00:32:14	00:32:19	Last time, you bought a car, this time, an elaborate fantasy to shut him up.
522	00:32:19	00:32:21	Problem is, he's dead.
523	00:32:21	00:32:23	And that makes you responsible.
524	00:32:23	00:32:26	Captain Brass...
525	00:32:27	00:32:29	you've seen too many of my movies.
526	00:32:31	00:32:34	I'd like to call my attorney now.
527	00:32:34	00:32:39	The script for Jeff's fantasy 00 p.m.
528	00:32:39	00:32:42	Then it says Randy drives the Corvette to The Cue-T and waits.
529	00:32:42	00:32:43	And Heidi takes the Ferrari.
530	00:32:43	00:32:48	Finds Jeff at the Palermo bar.
531	00:32:48	00:32:52	Her instructions were Make up story about abusive high roller boyfriend.
532	00:32:52	00:32:55	Allow Jeff to offer comfort.
533	00:32:55	00:32:56	Sorry. I'm really okay.
534	00:32:58	00:33:00	No, I'm not.
535	00:33:00	00:33:01	Anything I can do for you?
536	00:33:01	00:33:04	It's my damn boyfriend.
537	00:33:05	00:33:09	Any guy would help a beautiful woman in distress, right?
538	00:33:09	00:33:14	Some guys are intimidated by beauty or fear rejection.
539	00:33:14	00:33:16	Evidently, Caprice knew Jeff well enough to know he'd want to help her.
540	00:33:18	00:33:21	Repay subject's kindness by buying drink.
541	00:33:22	00:33:25	Which she then accidentally spills on his clothes.
542	00:33:25	00:33:31	Insists on buying him a new outfit, one that he couldn't afford on his own.
543	00:33:31	00:33:39	Everything was scripted down to the minute-- the clothes, The Cue-T, the car.
544	00:33:39	00:33:43	Sheridan told Caprice that Jeff had been shooting pool since he was a kid.
545	00:33:43	00:33:48	So betting on and winning a big money game was probably just part of the fantasy.
546	00:33:48	00:33:49	Yeah, and he was a NASCAR fan.
547	00:33:49	00:33:53	So the whole staged car chase, narrow getaway was everything he dreamed about.
548	00:33:53	00:33:56	As was the partying in his hotel room.
549	00:33:56	00:33:58	And the sex.
550	00:33:58	00:33:59	Not quite.
551	00:33:59	00:34:02	According to the script, Your employment ends with the good-night kiss.
552	00:34:02	00:34:08	You are not requested to perform, nor compensated for, any activity you initiate beyond this point.
553	00:34:08	00:34:13	Should nature take its course, you are on your own.
554	00:34:16	00:34:19	So the staged fantasy ended at Jeff's hotel room.
555	00:34:21	00:34:23	Which means he was off script when he was killed.
556	00:34:23	00:34:24	I don't get it.
557	00:34:24	00:34:27	After a night like that, I would have felt like Superman.
558	00:34:28	00:34:29	Why leave the girl?
559	00:34:31	00:34:37	The victim got to the shopping arcade 15 minutes after he got off the elevator.
560	00:34:37	00:34:38	It's not that long a walk.
561	00:34:38	00:34:41	I need to know what he was doing during that time.
562	00:34:43	00:34:44	There's your guy.
563	00:34:48	00:34:52	Whatever he's reacting to is off camera.
564	00:34:52	00:34:56	Somewhere in the direction of the baccarat tables.
565	00:34:56	00:35:00	When the blonde came up to the vic in the bar the first time, she pointed in that same direction.
566	00:35:00	00:35:02	What's going on over there?
567	00:35:04	00:35:07	He's playing solo with the dealer.
568	00:35:08	00:35:10	That's ten or 20,000 a hand.
569	00:35:10	00:35:11	Guy's a whale.
570	00:35:14	00:35:16	Your vic's really going at him.
571	00:35:17	00:35:25	You know, Heidi was only supposed to tell a story about a high roller boyfriend.
572	00:35:25	00:35:28	Maybe she actually picked somebody out.
573	00:35:34	00:35:35	What are you doing?
574	00:35:35	00:35:38	I've been looking at video three days solid now.
575	00:35:38	00:35:40	My butt fell asleep.
576	00:35:43	00:35:45	Wait a second.
577	00:35:45	00:35:49	I've seen those guys behind him somewhere else.
578	00:35:49	00:35:50	Hang on.
579	00:35:50	00:35:56	Jeff went from the casino to shopping arcade, And right behind him, it's them.
580	00:35:56	00:35:58	Same guys.
581	00:36:05	00:36:08	Well, call me Ishmael.
582	00:36:08	00:36:10	Why?
583	00:36:10	00:36:12	You need to read more, Arch.
584	00:36:15	00:36:19	Jeff was a winner at everything he tried that night.
585	00:36:19	00:36:21	And he was falling in love.
586	00:36:21	00:36:24	Which can make a guy do some pretty stupid things.
587	00:36:24	00:36:29	So anytime more than $10,000 hits the table, the casino's required to I.D. the player.
588	00:36:29	00:36:31	Which may help us harpoon a whale.
589	00:36:31	00:36:32	Yep.
590	00:36:35	00:36:37	What's the occasion?
591	00:36:37	00:36:40	We're investigating the death of the young man on the casino's loading dock.
592	00:36:40	00:36:42	Are you familiar with this guy?
593	00:36:42	00:36:44	That's Dennis Kim.
594	00:36:44	00:36:47	Flies in four, five times a year from Seoul to play baccarat.
595	00:36:47	00:36:48	Very generous player.
596	00:36:48	00:36:51	We reserve a table exclusively for him while he's in town.
597	00:36:51	00:36:53	He still in town?
598	00:36:53	00:36:55	Yeah.
599	00:36:55	00:36:56	He's at his table right now.
600	00:36:58	00:37:01	Player has two.
601	00:37:01	00:37:02	Bank.
602	00:37:02	00:37:05	Mr. Kim, we need to speak with you for a moment.
603	00:37:05	00:37:06	Yes?
604	00:37:06	00:37:09	Do you recognize this man?
605	00:37:12	00:37:14	Why?
606	00:37:14	00:37:15	He's dead.
607	00:37:17	00:37:19	Just before he died, he was talking to you.
608	00:37:21	00:37:22	Oh, yes, I remember him.
609	00:37:22	00:37:24	He was shouting about some girl.
610	00:37:24	00:37:26	Hey you!
611	00:37:26	00:37:27	Hey! Guess what?
612	00:37:28	00:37:32	Heidi, she doesn't need you or your money anymore, man.
613	00:37:32	00:37:36	That's right. Because she has everything she needs now-- love and respect.
614	00:37:36	00:37:39	So you go ahead and play your little card game.
615	00:37:39	00:37:40	All right?
616	00:37:40	00:37:41	'Cause you the playa.
617	00:37:41	00:37:42	But I'm the man.
618	00:37:42	00:37:45	The man.
619	00:37:45	00:37:46	Crazy boy.
620	00:37:47	00:37:49	Did you guys see where he went?
621	00:38:00	00:38:02	Well, we're gonna need to take those shoes.
622	00:38:02	00:38:04	White paint.
623	00:38:05	00:38:07	And if I don't permit this?
624	00:38:07	00:38:10	We'll just hold your men until we get a warrant.
625	00:38:17	00:38:19	Kamsahamnida.
626	00:39:17	00:39:21	The bodyguards dragged Jeff through the service corridor.
627	00:39:24	00:39:28	Between the drugs and the confidence, he must've put up quite a fight.
628	00:39:28	00:39:29	Hey!
629	00:39:32	00:39:34	Most likely, he was still alive when they left.
630	00:39:34	00:39:36	They probably thought they just had taught him a lesson.
631	00:39:38	00:39:40	Don't confuse fantasy with reality.
632	00:39:40	00:39:50	Well, hush money or not, you have to admit that whole fantasy night thing was a pretty cool gift from a very generous boss.
633	00:39:51	00:39:53	Greg, don't you have a birthday coming up?
634	00:39:53	00:39:55	Why, yes, Sara, I do.
635	00:39:57	00:40:03	I'm thinking ear-shredding rock, a beautiful model, boatloads of sushi and latex.
636	00:40:03	00:40:05	Eh, that was last year.
637	00:40:06	00:40:09	I think fantasies are best kept private.
638	00:40:09	00:40:11	Hey.
639	00:40:11	00:40:13	Want to know why Jeff left the girl and went downstairs?
640	00:40:14	00:40:15	Okay.
641	00:40:15	00:40:17	This was dropped off at the Palermo.
642	00:40:18	00:40:20	Manager sent it over.
643	00:40:20	00:40:22	Nice rocks.
644	00:40:22	00:40:25	Jeff must have spent the ten G's he won playing pool on it.
645	00:40:25	00:40:28	Gift wrapped, never picked it up.
646	00:40:28	00:40:32	Yeah, there was a jewelry store right across from the service corridor entrance.
647	00:40:36	00:40:38	Most I ever spent on a girl.
648	00:40:38	00:40:41	Most I ever held in my hand at one time.
649	00:40:45	00:40:50	You know, the biggest fantasy in Vegas is that everything here happens by chance.
650	00:40:50	00:40:52	Nothing here happens by chance.
651	00:40:52	00:40:55	The odds are set before you get off the plane.
652	00:40:57	00:41:00	You know, I'd settle for a birthday breakfast.
653	00:41:00	00:41:02	Now that is a fantasy.
