1,00:00:29,00:00:31,"Good evening, Mr. Braun. Go right in."
2,00:00:54,00:00:56,(gun cocks)
3,00:01:25,00:01:27,(laughing)
4,00:01:28,00:01:30,Woo!
5,00:01:33,00:01:39,I haven't been this out of breath since I bet Frank Sinatra I wasn't ticklish.
6,00:01:39,00:01:41,(laughter)
7,00:01:41,00:01:49,"In a few minutes, there'll be cake and champagne, so stick around; the party's not over yet."
8,00:01:49,00:01:51,(laughter and applause)
9,00:01:51,00:01:52,You've got eight minutes to change.
10,00:01:52,00:01:54,"I'll come help you. No, no, no. I'm fine."
11,00:01:54,00:01:55,Go get the cake ready.
12,00:01:55,00:01:58,"And, Eve..."
13,00:01:58,00:02:00,light the candles.
14,00:02:02,00:02:04,Oh... hi.
15,00:02:05,00:02:06,"Oh, hey, happy birthday."
16,00:02:06,00:02:09,"Um, I got to go soon..."
17,00:02:09,00:02:10,I got to go do my show.
18,00:02:10,00:02:12,So...
19,00:02:12,00:02:21,"For years, I did two shows a night, partied with the boys for hours, got a little sleep, played some tennis, gave interviews, got on stage and did it all over again."
20,00:02:21,00:02:23,That's talent.
21,00:02:25,00:02:27,You've got a look.
22,00:02:29,00:02:31,"Pace yourself, honey."
23,00:02:34,00:02:37,BRASS: Lois O'Neill's bedroom...
24,00:02:37,00:02:39,the stuff dreams are made of.
25,00:02:39,00:02:42,Or nightmares.
26,00:02:42,00:02:45,"Did, uh, Miss O'Neill tell you about this guy?"
27,00:02:45,00:02:46,BRASS: We don't know where she is.
28,00:02:46,00:02:47,She disappeared about an hour ago.
29,00:02:47,00:02:49,"Her assistant went looking for her, found the victim."
30,00:02:49,00:02:50,ID'd him as Tim Duke.
31,00:02:50,00:02:51,Gun left on the body...
32,00:02:52,00:02:53,isn't that how the mob used to do it?
33,00:02:54,00:02:57,"Well, back in the day, Lois O'Neill was famous for singing and dancing."
34,00:02:57,00:03:00,She was also famous for being the girlfriend of Tony Constantine...
35,00:03:00,00:03:02,One of the founding fathers of Vegas.
36,00:03:02,00:03:04,Looks like a bank vault.
37,00:03:06,00:03:10,"Well, the founding father has placed a high priority on home security."
38,00:03:10,00:03:12,"Have we been in there yet? No, it hasn't been cleared yet."
39,00:03:12,00:03:14,I'll go get the combination.
40,00:03:19,00:03:21,SANDERS: Ricochet marks.
41,00:03:28,00:03:30,(shutter clicks)
42,00:03:30,00:03:33,Possible bullet fragments.
43,00:03:36,00:03:37,(shutter clicks)
44,00:03:37,00:03:42,"Bullets here, body there..."
45,00:03:42,00:03:44,"Moving target, maybe."
46,00:03:44,00:03:47,"Gentlemen, this is Eve Girard, Miss O'Neill's assistant."
47,00:03:47,00:03:50,"Would you open the vault, please?"
48,00:03:50,00:03:52,I'll be downstairs.
49,00:04:03,00:04:05,(lock clicks)
50,00:04:09,00:04:10,Thank you.
51,00:04:20,00:04:22,(whimpering)
52,00:04:23,00:04:25,Just get it over with.
53,00:04:25,00:04:27,GIRARD: Lois!
54,00:04:28,00:04:30,"Lois! Oh, my God!"
55,00:04:32,00:04:34,Oh...
56,00:04:34,00:04:38,I thought this was my last birthday.
57,00:05:12,00:05:15,"In the middle of the party, you went upstairs to change."
58,00:05:15,00:05:16,Isn't that unusual?
59,00:05:17,00:05:18,"(laughs): No, I..."
60,00:05:18,00:05:25,"I always wear one outfit to greet guests, another for dinner and dancing, and another for dessert."
61,00:05:25,00:05:27,Thanks.
62,00:05:28,00:05:34,"So, uh, Tim Duke, the waiter... did you know him before this?"
63,00:05:34,00:05:38,He worked the Children's Hospital dance a few weeks ago.
64,00:05:38,00:05:40,He was charming.
65,00:05:44,00:05:46,I thought he could use the job.
66,00:05:46,00:05:47,Right.
67,00:05:48,00:05:49,I was changing.
68,00:05:49,00:05:51,I'd ordered a drink brought up.
69,00:05:51,00:05:53,(gunshot) (grunts)
70,00:05:53,00:05:55,(groaning)
71,00:05:56,00:05:58,"He was crawling, trying to get away."
72,00:05:59,00:06:00,(bullets ricochet)
73,00:06:01,00:06:03,And then I heard another shot.
74,00:06:03,00:06:04,(imitates gunshot)
75,00:06:04,00:06:06,(sniffles and cries)
76,00:06:07,00:06:10,"That's, uh..."
77,00:06:10,00:06:12,That's when I knew it was a mob hit.
78,00:06:12,00:06:17,"Look, if you find his family, I'd like to do something for them."
79,00:06:17,00:06:21,"I mean, after all, if he hadn't come in just then, I'd be dead."
80,00:06:22,00:06:23,Who'd want to kill you?
81,00:06:26,00:06:29,"Do you have a first name, Sanders?"
82,00:06:29,00:06:30,Greg.
83,00:06:30,00:06:32,Greg...
84,00:06:35,00:06:39,Do you...? Thank you.
85,00:06:44,00:06:45,Hot off the press.
86,00:06:46,00:06:48,I didn't hold back.
87,00:06:48,00:06:50,I named names.
88,00:06:50,00:06:53,"After all this time, I thought, who'd care?"
89,00:06:53,00:06:55,"Well, maybe you thought wrong."
90,00:06:57,00:06:58,(camera shutter clicks)
91,00:06:58,00:07:00,"Based on liver temp, been dead one to two hours."
92,00:07:00,00:07:07,"It looks like two shots-- one to the chest, and a through-and-through to the head."
93,00:07:08,00:07:09,SIDLE: Not a lot of blood.
94,00:07:09,00:07:14,Shot to the heart: sometimes it collects in the chest cavity rather than bleeding out.
95,00:07:17,00:07:19,A thousand...
96,00:07:19,00:07:23,"When I was a waiter back in college, if I had three twenties in my pocket, it was a good night."
97,00:07:23,00:07:26,"At Chuck E. Cheese, that was a good week."
98,00:07:26,00:07:28,Crack vial?
99,00:07:28,00:07:31,Could explain the cash; maybe he was dealing.
100,00:07:31,00:07:32,And these...
101,00:07:37,00:07:38,(sizzles)
102,00:07:38,00:07:42,"Found a crack vial on him, and $1,000 in cash."
103,00:07:45,00:07:48,"WILLOWS: Presidents, movie stars..."
104,00:07:48,00:07:53,A drug-dealing waiter isn't the kind of guy usually associated with Lois O'Neill.
105,00:07:53,00:07:54,On the other hand...
106,00:07:56,00:07:57,Tony Constantine.
107,00:08:03,00:08:05,(chuckles)
108,00:08:05,00:08:08,What?
109,00:08:08,00:08:10,WILLOWS: The Copa Girls from the Sands.
110,00:08:10,00:08:12,That's Lois O'Neill.
111,00:08:12,00:08:14,That's my mother.
112,00:08:19,00:08:22,"""Happy Birthday to my Beautiful Doll!"
113,00:08:22,00:08:23,"""Love always, Tony""?"
114,00:08:23,00:08:25,I thought he was dead.
115,00:08:25,00:08:28,"Dead, like Jimmy Hoffa."
116,00:08:28,00:08:30,The only guys who know aren't telling.
117,00:08:32,00:08:35,STOKES: This party is organized like an invasion plan.
118,00:08:35,00:08:38,"""6:15: bar set up and ready."
119,00:08:38,00:08:42,"""6:25: Lois greets guests in foyer."
120,00:08:42,00:08:47,"""7:15: Lois changes into her dinner outfit."" Talk about attention to detail."
121,00:08:47,00:08:51,From the security cameras on the perimeter of the building.
122,00:08:51,00:08:52,What about the interior cameras?
123,00:08:52,00:08:55,"With all the extra measures, Lois felt they weren't necessary."
124,00:08:55,00:08:58,"Frankly, I think she just didn't want to be caught on tape first thing in the morning."
125,00:08:58,00:09:01,"Hmm, I'll need a list of all the guests who were here tonight."
126,00:09:01,00:09:03,"Guests and staff, their affiliations and recent accomplishments..."
127,00:09:03,00:09:06,Lois likes to personalize conversation.
128,00:09:06,00:09:08,Everyone's still here.
129,00:09:08,00:09:10,You're thorough.
130,00:09:10,00:09:11,"Well, that's my job."
131,00:09:36,00:09:39,"Grissom, do you have any idea who's in this crowd?"
132,00:09:39,00:09:40,I sure do.
133,00:09:40,00:09:42,"""Under-sheriff Jeff McKeen."
134,00:09:42,00:09:46,"""Arrival: 6:38 PM. Wife: Amanda."
135,00:09:46,00:09:53,"""Recent accomplishment: ""ran marathon for Children's Hospital, placed tenth in his age group."" Good job, Jeff."
136,00:09:53,00:10:00,"More than one of these VIPs has the governor's home number, which is why my phone's been ringing with orders to let them go."
137,00:10:00,00:10:06,"Well, no one on this list came late or left early, so everyone here is still a suspect, until they're not."
138,00:10:06,00:10:11,"STOKES: And based on our interviews so far, only a few people actually left the room when Lois O'Neill was gone."
139,00:10:11,00:10:12,Who?
140,00:10:12,00:10:16,"Among others, her... a pop star known as Li'l Cherry."
141,00:10:16,00:10:20,She was due onstage at Mandalay Bay half an hour ago.
142,00:10:20,00:10:23,Keep her and anyone else who left the room.
143,00:10:23,00:10:24,Let the rest go.
144,00:10:29,00:10:32,Found this handkerchief hanging off the balcony.
145,00:10:32,00:10:33,I'll get it to Hodges.
146,00:10:33,00:10:35,Good.
147,00:10:35,00:10:37,By the way... Sam's here.
148,00:10:40,00:10:45,He's one of the guests who was out of the room when the murder occurred.
149,00:10:49,00:10:51,"Well, I should say hi to dear old Dad."
150,00:10:54,00:10:56,"Hi, Sam. Mugs."
151,00:10:57,00:11:00,"Sam, when you left this room tonight, where did you go?"
152,00:11:00,00:11:02,Upstairs?
153,00:11:02,00:11:06,"Just walked around downstairs, saying hello to the old ghosts."
154,00:11:08,00:11:11,"You know, I introduced Lois and Tony, back when I was a floor manager."
155,00:11:11,00:11:13,She was in the line with your mother.
156,00:11:13,00:11:15,Mm.
157,00:11:15,00:11:17,Maybe Mom fell for the wrong gangster.
158,00:11:17,00:11:21,Lily was a sweet girl.
159,00:11:21,00:11:25,But Lois... she had to be a star.
160,00:11:25,00:11:29,"A real coal miner's daughter from Frackville, Pennsylvania."
161,00:11:29,00:11:31,"But once she met Tony, she never had to go back."
162,00:11:33,00:11:36,"You always were a sucker for a hot dancer, weren't you, Sam?"
163,00:11:36,00:11:41,"Me and Lois-- I love her, but I like to be in the driver's seat."
164,00:11:41,00:11:47,Like this dancer I'm seeing now-- she's working tonight; that's why I came stag.
165,00:11:47,00:11:50,Must be serious.
166,00:11:50,00:11:54,That's the first time you haven't asked me how Mom's doing.
167,00:11:54,00:11:56,"She's fine, by the way."
168,00:11:58,00:12:01,Mr. Jensen.
169,00:12:01,00:12:03,I'm Nick Stokes. I'm with the crime lab.
170,00:12:03,00:12:04,I'm familiar with your daughter's case.
171,00:12:04,00:12:07,Sorry for your loss.
172,00:12:07,00:12:09,"You knew Mr. Constantine, right?"
173,00:12:11,00:12:15,Were there any other friends of Mr. Constantine here tonight?
174,00:12:15,00:12:17,"Yeah, there were friends here."
175,00:12:17,00:12:18,And enemies.
176,00:12:18,00:12:21,You want to elaborate a little bit more on those enemies?
177,00:12:21,00:12:24,"Stokes, you trying to get me in trouble?"
178,00:12:24,00:12:27,"Hey, man, I'm just trying to get to the bottom of what happened here tonight."
179,00:12:27,00:12:29,Several witnesses said they saw you leave the room. Alone.
180,00:12:29,00:12:32,I went outside to have a cigarette-- told her I wouldn't smoke in the house.
181,00:12:32,00:12:34,Filthy habit. Trying to quit.
182,00:12:34,00:12:36,Mm.
183,00:12:36,00:12:38,Frickin' cops won't let me go.
184,00:12:38,00:12:39,Yeah.
185,00:12:41,00:12:43,Miss Cherry? Bye-bye.
186,00:12:43,00:12:44,I'm with the crime lab.
187,00:12:44,00:12:46,I need to ask you a few questions.
188,00:12:46,00:12:49,(scoffs) (keypad beeping)
189,00:12:52,00:12:54,"CHERRY: Hey, it's me. Are they freaking out backstage?"
190,00:12:54,00:12:56,What the...? Excuse me...
191,00:12:56,00:12:58,Please?
192,00:13:04,00:13:08,Where did you go when Miss O'Neill left the ballroom earlier this evening?
193,00:13:08,00:13:09,"Uh, the bathroom."
194,00:13:09,00:13:12,Do you recall what time you came back?
195,00:13:12,00:13:14,"What, do you punch a clock every time you take a leak?"
196,00:13:18,00:13:20,Did you know the victim-- Tim Duke?
197,00:13:20,00:13:21,"I don't know anybody, okay?"
198,00:13:21,00:13:23,My publicist made me come to this thing.
199,00:13:23,00:13:25,"I guess Lo-Lo needed somebody with a pulse, so..."
200,00:13:25,00:13:27,May I take a look at your handbag? I got a show to do.
201,00:13:28,00:13:30,"I've got 2,000 people waiting for me right now."
202,00:13:30,00:13:34,"We can get a warrant, but you'll get out of here faster if you let me see the bag."
203,00:13:35,00:13:37,Get your hands off of her!
204,00:13:42,00:13:45,Well... now I don't need a warrant.
205,00:13:59,00:14:01,"I don't know how that crack pipe got in my purse, so..."
206,00:14:01,00:14:08,"There. My client denies the pipe is hers, denies any drug use, doesn't know the victim and has no prior relationship to Miss O'Neill."
207,00:14:08,00:14:10,There's nothing to discuss.
208,00:14:11,00:14:12,The pipe was in your possession.
209,00:14:12,00:14:15,"Plus, you were displaying symptoms of crack use publicly."
210,00:14:15,00:14:22,"CURTIS: And you were at a recent party where the victim, who also used crack, was working."
211,00:14:22,00:14:24,You admitted to leaving the ballroom after Miss O'Neill...
212,00:14:24,00:14:26,Coincidences don't make a homicide.
213,00:14:26,00:14:29,You recognized Tim Duke and you needed a fix.
214,00:14:29,00:14:30,Come on... I don't got it.
215,00:14:30,00:14:32,"I told you before. Come on, man."
216,00:14:32,00:14:35,"Look... Here, man. See?"
217,00:14:35,00:14:37,What are you gonna give me? Hey!
218,00:14:37,00:14:39,Oh! Really!
219,00:14:40,00:14:41,You wiped down the gun with a handkerchief...
220,00:14:41,00:14:43,No one has established that my client had a gun.
221,00:14:43,00:14:47,"And you didn't want to be seen leaving the bedroom, so you climbed down the balcony to rejoin the party."
222,00:14:48,00:14:49,Which is how you scraped your knees.
223,00:14:53,00:14:55,(laughing)
224,00:14:55,00:14:57,"Okay, I'll admit I was outside."
225,00:14:57,00:14:59,But... It's in your best interests not to...
226,00:14:59,00:15:02,It's cool. Um...
227,00:15:02,00:15:12,"It wasn't just, uh, Lois's birthday tonight, it was also my bodyguard's birthday, and I scraped my knees giving him his present."
228,00:15:13,00:15:16,CURTIS: You're going to need to cancel your shows for awhile.
229,00:15:16,00:15:20,"We're holding you on possession of paraphernalia, and unlawful use."
230,00:15:21,00:15:24,What do I have to do to make you believe me?
231,00:15:24,00:15:27,I already had my birthday.
232,00:15:27,00:15:30,"ROBBINS: All right, areas of callus here."
233,00:15:30,00:15:34,Old fractures... ribs...
234,00:15:34,00:15:36,This guy must've worked some pretty rough shifts.
235,00:15:36,00:15:38,"That must be the bullet, right there."
236,00:15:38,00:15:41,"Yeah, I'll yank it in autopsy."
237,00:15:41,00:15:43,What's that happening all around the nose area?
238,00:15:43,00:15:44,ROBBINS: It's a nose cage.
239,00:15:44,00:15:47,Nose has been wired to the skull to hold it in place.
240,00:15:54,00:15:57,"We find them sometimes in boxers, accident victims..."
241,00:15:57,00:15:59,You ever see one on a waiter?
242,00:15:59,00:16:05,"Wow! You know, Lois had her first sexual experience on her ninth-grade field trip to the state capitol..."
243,00:16:05,00:16:07,with the governor.
244,00:16:07,00:16:08,I found the bullet hole.
245,00:16:08,00:16:09,Could you bring the Sawzall?
246,00:16:09,00:16:13,"Well, you know, this place is a piece of Las Vegas history; you don't want to just go and chop it up."
247,00:16:13,00:16:17,"It's a crime scene, and there's evidence under the floor."
248,00:16:17,00:16:20,"Yeah, but we don't know exactly where it is, so..."
249,00:16:24,00:16:28,"...I thought we'd let ""Hawkeye"" here do a little exploration for us."
250,00:16:28,00:16:33,"Sure. I wouldn't want to damage priceless, 40-year-old carpeting."
251,00:16:33,00:16:34,No.
252,00:16:34,00:16:37,(machine whirring)
253,00:16:55,00:16:56,What's that say?
254,00:16:56,00:16:58,Pull it up.
255,00:17:03,00:17:05,Ten grand brick.
256,00:17:05,00:17:07,Benjamin bit the bullet.
257,00:17:07,00:17:14,"""In God We Trust."" If she has a vault, why is she keeping cash under the floor?"
258,00:17:14,00:17:16,No more room under the mattress?
259,00:17:26,00:17:28,Easy access in case you need to rewire.
260,00:17:36,00:17:38,Or steal a million.
261,00:17:44,00:17:46,Hey. Hey.
262,00:17:46,00:17:49,Mandy got an AFIS hit off the vic.
263,00:17:49,00:17:55,"His aka is Tim Duke, but his real name is Vincent Pullone, a one-time Golden Gloves wannabe."
264,00:17:55,00:17:57,That would explain the prior injuries.
265,00:17:57,00:17:59,"Yeah, well, so does his rap sheet."
266,00:17:59,00:18:01,"The guy was busy: multiple assaults, theft..."
267,00:18:01,00:18:04,Is that the surveillance footage?
268,00:18:04,00:18:05,STOKES: Yeah.
269,00:18:05,00:18:07,I've been through the footage throughout the entire day.
270,00:18:07,00:18:10,I've got the party staffers coming in and out the back door.
271,00:18:10,00:18:15,"But, get this-- same time, different entrance."
272,00:18:18,00:18:20,"BROWN: Well, that's our vic."
273,00:18:20,00:18:21,"STOKES: Yeah, a couple minutes later."
274,00:18:22,00:18:25,"Now, here..."
275,00:18:25,00:18:32,"around the time of the murder, same car... pulls up... waits."
276,00:18:32,00:18:34,Freeze that. Can you get a plate number?
277,00:18:34,00:18:35,Yeah.
278,00:18:35,00:18:37,"(typing, computer beeping)"
279,00:18:39,00:18:41,BROWN: Nice.
280,00:18:41,00:18:45,"STOKES: Nevada 295, Ocean, Henry, Union."
281,00:18:49,00:18:53,"BROWN: ""Nanci... Mc... Ma..."" McGinnigle... McGonigle."
282,00:18:53,00:18:55,McGonigle? McGonigle.
283,00:18:55,00:18:56,I'll run it through Brass.
284,00:18:56,00:18:59,Handkerchief is linen. Edging appears to be hand-stitched.
285,00:18:59,00:19:02,Pretty nice rag to be wiping a gun off with.
286,00:19:02,00:19:04,"Oh, so it was positive for gun oil."
287,00:19:04,00:19:09,Yeah. And the diphenylamine test was also positive for oxidizers and partially burned gunpowder.
288,00:19:09,00:19:11,"Uh, negative for prints or DNA."
289,00:19:11,00:19:16,"So, Mandy wasn't able to lift any prints off of the cash we found."
290,00:19:16,00:19:18,"Fingerprints are just oil, water and amino acids, Greg."
291,00:19:18,00:19:19,They don't last forever.
292,00:19:19,00:19:20,No kidding.
293,00:19:21,00:19:22,"You ever hear that expression ""old money""?"
294,00:19:22,00:19:26,This stuff was ancient-- some of it's signed by Eisenhower's Treasury Secretary.
295,00:19:27,00:19:29,Series dates all before 1965.
296,00:19:29,00:19:31,Same with the grand we found on the vic.
297,00:19:31,00:19:32,Ancient?
298,00:19:32,00:19:33,(clattering in distance)
299,00:19:33,00:19:36,O'NEILL: Set them down...
300,00:19:41,00:19:43,GRISSOM: Miss O'Neill! Nice to see you.
301,00:19:44,00:19:45,What's all this?
302,00:19:45,00:19:47,An army travels on its stomach.
303,00:19:47,00:19:53,"I wanted you and your people to know how grateful I am for all you've done for me. Well, thank you."
304,00:19:53,00:19:58,"But, uh, we can't accept anything that might influence the outcome of the case-- it's our policy."
305,00:19:58,00:19:59,"Oh, come on."
306,00:19:59,00:20:02,Cold cuts... a little shrimp salad.
307,00:20:02,00:20:04,Shrimp salad... (clicks tongue)
308,00:20:04,00:20:05,I know what we can do.
309,00:20:06,00:20:08,Have your boys take it down the street to the St. Vincent homeless shelter.
310,00:20:08,00:20:10,They need it more than we do.
311,00:20:10,00:20:12,Well... (huffs)
312,00:20:19,00:20:21,"Having fun with my book, Greg?"
313,00:20:21,00:20:23,"Oh, yeah. That beach party..."
314,00:20:23,00:20:25,Hoo-hoo-hoo. Marilyn Monroe and the President...
315,00:20:25,00:20:27,Swing-a-ding-ding.
316,00:20:30,00:20:34,"By the way, Miss O'Neill, we made an interesting discovery under the floor of your bedroom."
317,00:20:34,00:20:37,I was hoping you could tell us about it.
318,00:20:37,00:20:41,Under the floor...?
319,00:20:41,00:20:43,You tell me.
320,00:20:43,00:20:45,Approximately one million dollars in cash.
321,00:20:50,00:20:54,(laughs)
322,00:20:54,00:20:56,What do you know.
323,00:20:56,00:20:59,Tony always said I'd be taken care of.
324,00:21:00,00:21:03,"If you don't know anything about the money, maybe you know someone who does."
325,00:21:03,00:21:06,"SANDERS: Benny Dunbar, Jimmy the Crumb..."
326,00:21:08,00:21:11,You'd have to ask Tony.
327,00:21:13,00:21:14,Where is the money now?
328,00:21:14,00:21:16,It's in our evidence vault.
329,00:21:16,00:21:18,"Oh. And, uh..."
330,00:21:18,00:21:21,when will it be returned?
331,00:21:21,00:21:23,We have to finish our investigation first.
332,00:21:23,00:21:25,You do that.
333,00:21:27,00:21:31,You know... (sighs)
334,00:21:31,00:21:37,the boys who want me dead have been doing this a lot longer than you have.
335,00:21:37,00:21:41,I need you to catch up. Fast.
336,00:21:44,00:21:50,"Oh, and remember, when your tummy starts to rumble, I tried to help."
337,00:21:58,00:22:00,"There. There, that piece of paper, zoom in on that."
338,00:22:00,00:22:02,(computer beeps)
339,00:22:05,00:22:06,See if I can enhance that.
340,00:22:06,00:22:07,(typing)
341,00:22:07,00:22:10,"STOKES: What is that, a bar code?"
342,00:22:10,00:22:14,Looks like a PDF417... two-dimensional bar code.
343,00:22:14,00:22:16,Can you decode it?
344,00:22:16,00:22:17,I think so.
345,00:22:19,00:22:29,"JOHNSON: Okay, it's an airline boarding pass, last night: Vegas to Philadelphia, then on to Rome, and Sardinia."
346,00:22:29,00:22:34,Two passengers: Nanci McGonigle and Vincent Pullone.
347,00:22:34,00:22:41,"Vincent Pullone was the vic's real name, and he arrived at the crime scene in Nanci McGonigle's car."
348,00:22:41,00:22:48,"JOHNSON: According to the airline global distribution system, she boarded the flight, he didn't."
349,00:22:48,00:22:52,He was busy being dead.
350,00:22:52,00:22:55,Your fingerprint was on the light fixture in the hallway.
351,00:22:55,00:22:57,You knew about the money.
352,00:22:57,00:23:01,"When the light fixture shorted out, Lois wanted it replaced right away."
353,00:23:01,00:23:04,"I did it myself, and I found the money."
354,00:23:04,00:23:06,How much did you take?
355,00:23:09,00:23:11,"One bundle-- 10,000. I-I still have most of it."
356,00:23:11,00:23:14,Did you tell Miss O'Neill?
357,00:23:14,00:23:16,No. And that was wrong.
358,00:23:16,00:23:21,But it was also wrong of her to hire me as a book editor and use me as a personal slave.
359,00:23:21,00:23:22,How well did you know Vincent Pullone?
360,00:23:22,00:23:27,"A.K.A. ""Tim Duke."" (sighs heavily)"
361,00:23:27,00:23:29,Not very well.
362,00:23:29,00:23:32,But well enough to give him a thousand dollars?
363,00:23:32,00:23:35,We were dating. He needed the money.
364,00:23:35,00:23:42,"If you were dating, why was he planning to fly to Sardinia after the party with Nanci McGonigle?"
365,00:23:42,00:23:43,He didn't mention her.
366,00:23:43,00:23:46,Someone in the house gave him the tickets.
367,00:23:46,00:23:47,"Well, not me."
368,00:23:52,00:23:53,(bullet clanks)
369,00:23:53,00:23:56,Sounds like the bullet to me.
370,00:23:57,00:24:01,"Yeah. Deformed, medium caliber, consistent with a .38."
371,00:24:01,00:24:03,Take a look at the heart.
372,00:24:05,00:24:12,"Bullet passed into the base of the right ventricle, crossed the intraventricular septum and destroyed the AV node."
373,00:24:12,00:24:14,Heart stopped on impact.
374,00:24:14,00:24:22,"Right. Bullet then exited out the back of the left ventricle and entered the vertebral spine, transecting the spinal cord."
375,00:24:22,00:24:24,(gunshot)
376,00:24:24,00:24:26,(bullet thuds)
377,00:24:27,00:24:30,Could the victim have crawled around after suffering that kind of damage?
378,00:24:30,00:24:33,Negative. He would have been paralyzed instantly.
379,00:24:33,00:24:35,Could the shot to the head have occurred first?
380,00:24:35,00:24:38,"You are ""O""-for-two."
381,00:24:38,00:24:39,Check out the brain.
382,00:24:45,00:24:47,There's no blood in the wound track.
383,00:24:47,00:24:48,Nope.
384,00:24:48,00:24:50,So his heart had already stopped pumping.
385,00:24:50,00:24:58,"From the absence of blood, I'd say that this shot was at least ten minutes after the shot through the heart."
386,00:24:58,00:25:03,Lois O'Neill claims that she saw the victim crawling away after she heard the first shot.
387,00:25:03,00:25:07,"Well, maybe Lois' memory is a little flawed."
388,00:25:07,00:25:10,"Oh, no. She has a great memory."
389,00:25:22,00:25:25,(soft jazz music plays)
390,00:25:32,00:25:33,(indistinct conversation)
391,00:25:33,00:25:34,(laughter)
392,00:25:38,00:25:39,The gang's all here!
393,00:25:40,00:25:42,BRASS: We need to ask you some questions.
394,00:25:42,00:25:45,"Well, please, sit. I-I have no secrets from Bobby..."
395,00:25:45,00:25:47,my guardian angel.
396,00:25:47,00:25:50,"Yeah, we've met. Isn't that right, Bob?"
397,00:25:50,00:25:51,"Uh, yeah, that's right."
398,00:25:52,00:25:54,"Please, sit."
399,00:25:54,00:25:57,How often do you get invited to the best table in town?
400,00:25:57,00:26:00,I know you must be hungry.
401,00:26:00,00:26:08,"Miss O'Neill, we found some inconsistencies in your account of last night's events."
402,00:26:08,00:26:10,Wha...?
403,00:26:10,00:26:13,You said that you saw Tim Duke crawling away after you heard the first shot.
404,00:26:17,00:26:18,(sighs): Yes.
405,00:26:18,00:26:21,It was horrible.
406,00:26:21,00:26:24,"According to our autopsy, the first shot paralyzed him."
407,00:26:24,00:26:26,He would've been unable to move.
408,00:26:30,00:26:32,O'NEILL (stammering): Well...
409,00:26:32,00:26:36,It-It all happened in such a flash...
410,00:26:36,00:26:38,(gunshot) (grunts)
411,00:26:38,00:26:41,(groaning)
412,00:26:41,00:26:44,Uh...
413,00:26:44,00:26:46,JENSEN: All right.
414,00:26:46,00:26:47,She's the target.
415,00:26:47,00:26:49,She told you all she knows.
416,00:26:53,00:26:55,(chuckles)
417,00:26:55,00:26:59,"This has been fun, but... we have to go."
418,00:26:59,00:27:00,Beauty sleep.
419,00:27:00,00:27:03,Speaking of which...
420,00:27:03,00:27:08,When is that ugly yellow tape coming off my bedroom door?
421,00:27:08,00:27:10,"Just as soon as we finish our work, I promise."
422,00:27:12,00:27:15,Anymore questions... just call.
423,00:27:23,00:27:24,SANDERS: Tuna...
424,00:27:24,00:27:27,and the homeless are dining on shrimp salad.
425,00:27:27,00:27:29,Lucky clydes.
426,00:27:29,00:27:33,"""Lucky clydes?"" Is that lingo from Lois' book?"
427,00:27:33,00:27:36,BROWN: She say anything in that book about all that dough we found under her floor?
428,00:27:36,00:27:38,Not exactly.
429,00:27:38,00:27:46,"But she does say back in '65, Vegas was getting a little bit too hot for Tony C, so he had to take a powder for a while."
430,00:27:46,00:27:51,"And dig this: while he was gone, the famous Pan Am heist was pulled off back east."
431,00:27:51,00:27:53,The famous Pan Am heist?
432,00:27:53,00:27:58,"And, compadre, in the next chapter, Tony builds Lois the house."
433,00:27:58,00:28:01,"Connect the dots, buddy boy."
434,00:28:01,00:28:02,(chuckles)
435,00:28:02,00:28:10,"All right, this is what we got so far: We got a loser boxer, who's a crack head, probably selling drugs-- and someone buys him two tickets to Sardinia."
436,00:28:10,00:28:12,Why?
437,00:28:12,00:28:20,"Maybe somebody wanted Lois dead, knew that Tim had access and that he needed the money for a drug habit?"
438,00:28:20,00:28:23,Are you saying that he was a hit man and not an innocent bystander?
439,00:28:23,00:28:28,"Well, it would make Lois' story correct-- that she really was the target."
440,00:28:28,00:28:31,"Yeah, but who killed him? And why?"
441,00:28:31,00:28:42,"SANDERS: Consider this nutty notion: Tony's not worm food, he's around; he finds out that Lois went canary and wrote the book, so he hires some protection, someone who'd be at the party."
442,00:28:42,00:28:47,"SIDLE: Whether Tim Duke was a hit man or not, he could have been the target all along."
443,00:28:47,00:28:49,"BROWN: Yeah, yeah."
444,00:28:49,00:28:52,Then you go whack him when he's working around every VIP in town. Sure.
445,00:28:52,00:28:55,Sure. Especially if Lois was an accomplice.
446,00:28:55,00:28:58,"Or, dare I say, the killer."
447,00:28:58,00:29:02,"Well, I don't see homicide anywhere on her schedule."
448,00:29:02,00:29:04,(laughs)
449,00:29:06,00:29:10,Wait a sec...
450,00:29:10,00:29:16,"That's Lois' dinner outfit, and that's the dress she was wearing when we opened up the vault."
451,00:29:18,00:29:20,Let's test them both for blood and GSR.
452,00:29:24,00:29:26,"SIDLE: Looking under ""formal""..."
453,00:29:26,00:29:27,(typing)
454,00:29:27,00:29:31,Dress number 161.
455,00:29:31,00:29:33,"130, 131, 132..."
456,00:29:34,00:29:36,"Got to admit, this is some kind of closet."
457,00:29:39,00:29:43,"Uh, it's 1-... 61."
458,00:29:43,00:29:47,Oh. 161-- hanger's empty.
459,00:29:47,00:29:48,She got rid of the clothes?
460,00:29:49,00:29:53,It's possible she sent them to the cleaners to get rid of blood and GSR.
461,00:29:53,00:29:54,We can get a warrant.
462,00:29:54,00:29:58,Well... she wouldn't have sent her jewelry to the cleaners.

464,00:30:02,00:30:05,Got it. Drawer 19.
465,00:30:08,00:30:14,Oh. How apropos that she's named names.
466,00:30:14,00:30:16,A canary diamond.
467,00:30:16,00:30:20,SIDLE: Want to bet the birdie sings in the key of GSR?
468,00:30:52,00:30:53,Mom?
469,00:30:54,00:30:55,What are you doing?
470,00:30:56,00:30:57,Where's Lindsey?
471,00:30:57,00:30:59,She's on a sleep-over.
472,00:30:59,00:31:02,So kill me.
473,00:31:02,00:31:05,And I had dinner at Drai's with the girls.
474,00:31:05,00:31:08,Filet to die for.
475,00:31:08,00:31:10,Drai's...
476,00:31:10,00:31:14,The girls like to spend.
477,00:31:14,00:31:17,(sneezes)
478,00:31:17,00:31:22,Red wine always makes me two of the Seven Dwarfs: Sleepy and Sneezy.
479,00:31:22,00:31:23,(sniffs)
480,00:31:23,00:31:26,Where did you get that hanky?
481,00:31:26,00:31:27,A friend.
482,00:31:29,00:31:32,A friend who was at Lois' party?
483,00:31:32,00:31:33,(sighs)
484,00:31:33,00:31:35,"Now don't get mad, Catherine."
485,00:31:35,00:31:36,You can't be seeing Sam?
486,00:31:36,00:31:38,And why not?
487,00:31:38,00:31:39,"Oh, for one thing, he's a player."
488,00:31:39,00:31:42,I don't expect monogamy from him.
489,00:31:42,00:31:43,I can't believe this.
490,00:31:44,00:31:46,"And I am not promising that he'll get it from me, either."
491,00:31:46,00:31:48,What are you doing?
492,00:31:48,00:31:51,Put it in the envelope. Why?!
493,00:31:51,00:31:53,Because we haven't cleared Sam as a suspect.
494,00:31:53,00:31:54,He can't be!
495,00:31:54,00:31:58,He has been so wonderful to me these past few weeks.
496,00:31:58,00:32:01,"Oh, this has been going on for weeks, huh?"
497,00:32:01,00:32:04,"We have a history together, Catherine."
498,00:32:04,00:32:08,We were young together.
499,00:32:08,00:32:10,"Some day, maybe you'll understand."
500,00:32:15,00:32:17,(siren blares)
501,00:32:34,00:32:39,"You want to see me, Muggs, all you need is a phone."
502,00:32:39,00:32:43,You lied about being in Lois O'Neill's bedroom.
503,00:32:43,00:32:46,I was in that bedroom once.
504,00:32:46,00:32:48,In 1967.
505,00:32:48,00:32:53,"As a gentleman, I would prefer not going into details."
506,00:32:53,00:32:58,Your handkerchief puts you there when the waiter was shot.
507,00:33:00,00:33:02,One of these?
508,00:33:05,00:33:09,Lois and I were going over old times.
509,00:33:09,00:33:12,She got a little weepy.
510,00:33:15,00:33:20,"What she did with it after that, I don't know."
511,00:33:20,00:33:22,My housekeeper made me a dozen for Christmas.
512,00:33:22,00:33:24,I've only got half left.
513,00:33:24,00:33:27,So quit giving them away.
514,00:33:30,00:33:34,Oh... you're mothering me.
515,00:33:37,00:33:44,"You know, Sam, this is the second time that I thought that you might be a killer."
516,00:33:44,00:33:48,"Come on, you know better."
517,00:33:48,00:33:50,"The thing is, I don't."
518,00:33:52,00:33:57,It never occurred to me for a minute that this is something that you wouldn't have done.
519,00:33:57,00:34:02,"And that wouldn't bother me, except you're dating my mother."
520,00:34:02,00:34:07,"Look, I'm being good to Lil this time around."
521,00:34:07,00:34:11,Give us a chance.
522,00:34:12,00:34:15,Give me a chance.
523,00:34:15,00:34:17,You'll see.
524,00:34:17,00:34:21,Making up for stabbing one showgirl by being kind to another. Hmm.
525,00:34:21,00:34:26,If you weren't my daughter...
526,00:34:26,00:34:27,What?
527,00:34:27,00:34:30,"What would you do, Sam?"
528,00:34:37,00:34:39,(door slams shut)
529,00:34:51,00:34:54,"Vanity, thy name is Hodges."
530,00:34:54,00:34:57,This isn't what it looks like.
531,00:34:57,00:34:59,I actually like my gray hair.
532,00:34:59,00:35:01,The few that I have.
533,00:35:01,00:35:05,"Hodges, don't you know that gray hair can be very attractive?"
534,00:35:06,00:35:07,The ring?
535,00:35:07,00:35:09,The ring?
536,00:35:10,00:35:11,The ring.
537,00:35:11,00:35:16,The ring was positive for GSR.
538,00:35:16,00:35:18,That means Lois could be the shooter.
539,00:35:22,00:35:24,I guess we'll have to bring her in.
540,00:35:29,00:35:32,One of your guys take the crime scene tape down?
541,00:35:32,00:35:34,Sara and Catherine cleared the scene about two hours ago.
542,00:35:42,00:35:45,"Miss O'Neill, Las Vegas Police."
543,00:35:56,00:35:58,Miss O'Neill?
544,00:36:44,00:36:45,"SANDERS: Wow, it's the end of an era."
545,00:36:45,00:36:51,"From the containment of the blood, it appears she was shot while lying down."
546,00:36:51,00:36:53,Asleep...
547,00:36:53,00:36:56,or surprised by someone she trusted?
548,00:36:56,00:37:03,Nick just found out that Tim Duke's airline tickets were purchased by a credit card under the name of Double-X Associates.
549,00:37:03,00:37:05,That's Lois O'Neill's company.
550,00:37:05,00:37:06,How do you know that?
551,00:37:06,00:37:08,She was the double-kiss girl.
552,00:37:08,00:37:11,"SANDERS: Yeah, you can't say her name without kissing twice."
553,00:37:11,00:37:15,Lois O'Neill-- Kiss-kiss. XX.
554,00:37:15,00:37:18,Huh.
555,00:37:18,00:37:27,"Well, Nick also found out that the only two names authorized to sign on that card, were Lois O'Neill and Eve Girard."
556,00:37:32,00:37:34,"She looks perfect, doesn't she?"
557,00:37:34,00:37:36,Except for these smudges on her eyelids.
558,00:38:13,00:38:18,"Grissom, you know I was looking into that Pan Am heist in '65?"
559,00:38:18,00:38:19,"On your own time, I hope."
560,00:38:19,00:38:21,It's related to our case.
561,00:38:21,00:38:23,I just got off the phone with the FBI lab at Quantico.
562,00:38:23,00:38:27,Bobby Dawson sent them ballistics on the gun we found on Tim Duke.
563,00:38:27,00:38:28,And?
564,00:38:28,00:38:31,It's a match to the gun that was used to kill a guard in the Pan Am heist.
565,00:38:31,00:38:34,So I sent them serials on the cash we found.
566,00:38:34,00:38:35,Also a match to the Pan Am heist?
567,00:38:36,00:38:38,"Right-o, daddy-o."
568,00:38:38,00:38:39,"Congratulations, Greg."
569,00:38:42,00:38:47,This is Doc Robbins' preliminary autopsy report on Lois O'Neill.
570,00:38:47,00:38:53,"When he opened her up, he found that her body was riddled with advanced tumors."
571,00:38:53,00:38:55,Wow.
572,00:38:57,00:38:59,She knew she was going to die.
573,00:38:59,00:39:06,"That's why she wrote the book, 'cause she knew that if she was gone, there'd be nobody left to tell the true story."
574,00:39:06,00:39:08,You read it.
575,00:39:09,00:39:11,Do you think that's how she wanted to go out?
576,00:39:11,00:39:12,No.
577,00:39:12,00:39:19,"But, uh... looking beautiful-- yeah."
578,00:39:19,00:39:21,In all the papers-- yeah.
579,00:39:22,00:39:23,Murdered...
580,00:39:23,00:39:26,Only if she was the one who called the shots.
581,00:39:26,00:39:28,Yeah.
582,00:39:28,00:39:30,(chuckles)
583,00:39:30,00:39:32,"Oh, we had some good times."
584,00:39:32,00:39:36,"You knew she had cancer? No, she had guts."
585,00:39:36,00:39:39,She staged her exit like a pro.
586,00:39:39,00:39:42,"The book, the party..."
587,00:39:42,00:39:45,She only made one mistake-- she hired an amateur.
588,00:39:45,00:39:46,Tim Duke?
589,00:39:47,00:39:48,Also known as Vincent Pullone?
590,00:39:48,00:39:52,A wimp and a thief.
591,00:39:52,00:39:57,"Lois would give you all the cookies you wanted, but you stuck your hand in the cookie jar..."
592,00:39:59,00:40:00,she'd chop it off.
593,00:40:02,00:40:05,"Try to relax, honey."
594,00:40:05,00:40:07,This'll be easy.
595,00:40:08,00:40:10,"I'll be on the bed, one shot."
596,00:40:10,00:40:13,Don't be sloppy.
597,00:40:23,00:40:25,What the hell? What do you care?
598,00:40:25,00:40:27,You're going to be dead anyway.
599,00:40:27,00:40:30,Nobody steals from me.
600,00:40:46,00:40:48,"Why'd she ask Duke, not you?"
601,00:40:48,00:40:51,She didn't want to involve an old friend.
602,00:40:51,00:40:53,Until yesterday.
603,00:40:53,00:40:58,"BRASS: Yesterday afternoon, Lois O'Neill wired $250,000 to your sister in Sarasota."
604,00:40:58,00:41:00,Now you were Tony C's driver.
605,00:41:01,00:41:04,The only one he trusted to bodyguard Miss O'Neill.
606,00:41:04,00:41:08,You took care of her right until the end.
607,00:41:08,00:41:11,"Well, who else do I have to take care of?"
608,00:41:11,00:41:15,"My guess is she offered you the money, but being a friend you refused."
609,00:41:15,00:41:17,So she sent it to your sister instead.
610,00:41:21,00:41:24,(chuckles softly)
611,00:41:24,00:41:27,She sent it to my sister.
612,00:41:27,00:41:43,"You know, you've got a choice between checking out all shriveled up, in a hospital, or at home, looking like a million bucks."
613,00:41:43,00:41:51,"Any guy who'd do that for a good friend, he's okay by me."
614,00:41:53,00:41:59,"If you see Tony, tell him I love him."
615,00:41:59,00:42:02,Doll...
616,00:42:03,00:42:06,you're going to see him before I do.
