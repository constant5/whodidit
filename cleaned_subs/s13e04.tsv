0	00:00:25	00:00:27	I didn't know you played, Jim.
1	00:00:27	00:00:29	I dabble.
2	00:00:29	00:00:31	That doesn't sound good.
3	00:00:31	00:00:32	No, it's not.
4	00:00:32	00:00:37	I got a call, a couple hikers wandered into what may be the piano show from hell.
5	00:00:37	00:00:39	A little out of the way for a concert.
6	00:00:39	00:00:41	Shall we?
7	00:00:41	00:00:45	Oh, boy.
8	00:00:45	00:00:47	Not your usual body dump.
9	00:00:47	00:00:48	I'm guessing mid-30s, no wallet, no purse.
10	00:00:48	00:00:50	Early stages of rigor.
11	00:00:50	00:00:53	Got to be dead at least eight to ten hours.
12	00:00:53	00:00:55	Blood pool inside the piano.
13	00:00:55	00:00:57	No accompanying blood on the ground.
14	00:00:57	00:00:58	She wasn't killed here.
15	00:01:01	00:01:02	You're awful quiet over there.
16	00:01:05	00:01:06	I know her.
17	00:01:08	00:01:11	Alison Bailey.
18	00:01:11	00:01:12	A music journalist from New York.
19	00:01:12	00:01:15	She helped me with my Vegas book a couple years ago.
20	00:01:15	00:01:17	Vegas book?
21	00:01:17	00:01:20	Yeah, about the history of the Mob in Las Vegas.
22	00:01:20	00:01:22	So, did you know her well?
23	00:01:24	00:01:26	Uh, a couple meetings.
24	00:01:26	00:01:29	She wrote a couple books herself.
25	00:01:29	00:01:31	About the music scene in Vegas in the '60s.
26	00:01:31	00:01:33	So, a piano expert ends up dead in a piano.
27	00:01:33	00:01:34	Got to be connected.
28	00:01:34	00:01:38	Whoever killed her wasn't a stranger in the night.
29	00:02:15	00:02:16	I hate pianos.
30	00:02:16	00:02:17	Really?
31	00:02:17	00:02:22	Six years of piano lessons-- my mother's idea.
32	00:02:22	00:02:24	Best day of my life?
33	00:02:24	00:02:28	My piano teacher backs her car into my mom's new Cadillac.
34	00:02:28	00:02:29	Never saw Mrs. Liebowitz again.
35	00:02:29	00:02:32	Lucky you. Mm-hmm.
36	00:02:33	00:02:36	Not so much for Greg, though.
37	00:02:36	00:02:38	Russell says he knew the victim.
38	00:02:38	00:02:39	Well, I hope he didn't know her well.
39	00:02:39	00:02:40	She was cut to ribbons.
40	00:02:45	00:02:47	Triangular dolly.
41	00:02:47	00:02:49	Rules out out any, uh, drunk pranks.
42	00:02:49	00:02:51	Hey, let's steal the bar piano.
43	00:02:53	00:02:56	Whoever did this could have been a professional mover.
44	00:02:58	00:03:00	At least this one's intact.
45	00:03:00	00:03:03	Most pianos suffer a worse fate.
46	00:03:03	00:03:05	I didn't realize pianos had fates.
47	00:03:05	00:03:06	Generally, a junkyard.
48	00:03:06	00:03:09	Thousands of moving parts.
49	00:03:09	00:03:11	Repairs are expensive.
50	00:03:11	00:03:13	Cheaper to buy a new one.
51	00:03:13	00:03:15	Yeah, or some digital keyboard.
52	00:03:16	00:03:18	It's a shame.
53	00:03:18	00:03:20	Old pianos are a thing of beauty.
54	00:03:23	00:03:26	Look at the end of the dolly tracks here.
55	00:03:29	00:03:30	Rectangular impression.
56	00:03:30	00:03:32	Maybe from a truck tailgate?
57	00:03:34	00:03:36	Piano's dropped here, little push.
58	00:03:36	00:03:37	Could have been a one-man job.
59	00:03:41	00:03:43	Something is wedged between the keys.
60	00:03:48	00:03:52	Edges are jagged, and it's opaque.
61	00:03:52	00:03:54	Maybe some kind of latex?
62	00:03:58	00:03:59	Did you see this? Black trace?
63	00:03:59	00:04:02	Yeah, it's all over the keys.
64	00:04:02	00:04:05	It's also all over the inside of the piano case.
65	00:04:05	00:04:08	Let's collect it, get this piano back to the lab.
66	00:04:19	00:04:21	Whole right side's lit up.
67	00:04:21	00:04:25	So, the victim was definitely slashed in proximity to the piano.
68	00:04:25	00:04:26	With extreme force.
69	00:04:26	00:04:30	Blood says killer had to have sliced her carotid.
70	00:04:36	00:04:39	Haggenmiller and Sons.
71	00:04:39	00:04:41	Looks like somebody's obliterated the serial number.
72	00:04:41	00:04:47	Do you know since 1896, all Haggenmiller pianos were manufactured at the same factory in St. Paul?
73	00:04:47	00:04:52	With the serial number, you can track a piano to the exact date it left the factory floor.
74	00:04:52	00:04:55	I take it this is not your first body in a piano.
75	00:04:55	00:04:56	First ones with the limbs intact.
76	00:04:56	00:05:00	Well, I always knew Seattle was a music town.
77	00:05:00	00:05:02	I'll see what I can do about bringing that serial number back to life.
78	00:05:02	00:05:06	If we can find out where the piano came from, maybe we'll find the killer.
79	00:05:40	00:05:42	Hey.
80	00:05:42	00:05:44	I, uh...
81	00:05:44	00:05:46	found a hotel key card.
82	00:05:46	00:05:48	She was, uh, staying at the Palermo.
83	00:05:50	00:05:52	What was she like?
84	00:05:52	00:05:54	A small-town girl from Iowa.
85	00:05:54	00:05:56	Smart.
86	00:05:56	00:05:57	Funny.
87	00:05:57	00:05:59	Huge Sinatra fan.
88	00:06:01	00:06:02	Come on, Greg.
89	00:06:02	00:06:05	You guys were doing more than write a book, right?
90	00:06:05	00:06:08	It was a...
91	00:06:08	00:06:10	a week of fun.
92	00:06:10	00:06:11	Why didn't you guys stay in touch?
93	00:06:11	00:06:15	It was just a fling.
94	00:06:15	00:06:16	For you or for her?
95	00:06:16	00:06:21	If it meant that much to her, I think she would have looked me up.
96	00:06:22	00:06:23	Can we...
97	00:06:27	00:06:28	...keep this from Russell?
98	00:06:28	00:06:30	Sure.
99	00:06:30	00:06:32	I'll process her room.
100	00:06:34	00:06:37	I would stay out of autopsy.
101	00:06:37	00:06:41	C.O.D. is exsanguination due to multiple incised wounds.
102	00:06:41	00:06:43	27 to be exact.
103	00:06:43	00:06:44	Overkill.
104	00:06:44	00:06:46	But no sexual assault.
105	00:06:46	00:06:50	Defensive wounds on the fingers and wrist.
106	00:06:50	00:06:51	She put up a fight.
107	00:06:51	00:06:53	Any idea what the weapon was?
108	00:06:54	00:06:56	Hilt bruises on the wounds.
109	00:06:56	00:06:59	Depth and width suggest a box cutter.
110	00:06:59	00:07:02	Something that a piano mover might carry around with him?
111	00:07:02	00:07:05	I found these inorganics in a couple of the larger wounds.
112	00:07:08	00:07:12	This looks like the trace that Greg pulled out of the piano keys.
113	00:07:12	00:07:14	Hodges is already working on it.
114	00:07:27	00:07:28	So?
115	00:07:28	00:07:29	Hover much?
116	00:07:29	00:07:31	Results?
117	00:07:31	00:07:32	Shouldn't we wait for Russell first?
118	00:07:32	00:07:34	I'll stop the questions if you do.
119	00:07:34	00:07:36	Trace found in the piano and in the girl's wounds.
120	00:07:36	00:07:39	Carbon black and polyvinylchloride.
121	00:07:42	00:07:46	Hide glue, straight from the horse's... fibrous tissues.
122	00:07:46	00:07:48	You see how these edges line up?
123	00:07:48	00:07:54	I'm thinking that our shards des Monsieur Ed are from one sheet of dried glue.
124	00:07:58	00:08:01	There are striations on one side.
125	00:08:01	00:08:03	Looks like a wood grain imprint.
126	00:08:03	00:08:06	So you're thinking a piano repairman got into it with our victim?
127	00:08:06	00:08:08	Well, who else would be using glue on a piano?
128	00:08:08	00:08:10	That's a brilliant theory, Greg.
129	00:08:10	00:08:11	There's just one problem.
130	00:08:11	00:08:18	See, I tested all the glue that held our piano together and it's not a match to any of the fragments that you found.
131	00:08:18	00:08:24	Oh, and the carbon black and polyvinylchloride-- it's sheet vinyl, commonly used in floor tile covering.
132	00:08:24	00:08:27	My theory is that you're looking for somebody in construction.
133	00:08:30	00:08:31	My pleasure.
134	00:08:37	00:08:39	What's all this?
135	00:08:39	00:08:42	It's evidence from Alison's hotel room at the Palermo?
136	00:08:42	00:08:44	She checked in five days ago.
137	00:08:44	00:08:46	It's definitely not our primary though.
138	00:08:46	00:08:47	Place was clean.
139	00:08:47	00:08:49	Well, was she moving in?
140	00:08:49	00:08:50	She set up a work station.
141	00:08:50	00:08:52	Lots of books and files.
142	00:08:52	00:08:54	Think she was researching a new book.
143	00:08:54	00:08:56	I also found this.
144	00:08:56	00:08:59	An appointment book.
145	00:08:59	00:09:01	Last entry was yesterday.
146	00:09:04	00:09:09	Some kind of number/letter sequence Doesn't look like a VIN number.
147	00:09:09	00:09:10	I was just about to run it.
148	00:09:10	00:09:12	I'll take these.
149	00:09:14	00:09:18	Sin City Secrets by Greg Sanders.
150	00:09:18	00:09:19	Nice photo.
151	00:09:19	00:09:24	Hm. So I guess you were, uh, a big part of her research?
152	00:09:24	00:09:25	You didn't even know it, huh?
153	00:09:26	00:09:27	Hey, there you are.
154	00:09:27	00:09:29	Wow, those are a lot of boxes.
155	00:09:29	00:09:31	Uh, I ran the serial number on the piano.
156	00:09:31	00:09:36	It was built in 1966, and the original owner was a guy named Ledo Wright.
157	00:09:36	00:09:39	Wait-- the Ledo Wright?
158	00:09:39	00:09:41	I didn't know there was a the involved.
159	00:09:42	00:09:43	Well, who is he?
160	00:09:43	00:09:45	Only a legend.
161	00:09:45	00:09:46	That both of us have never heard of.
162	00:09:46	00:09:47	What is so legendary?
163	00:09:47	00:09:51	How he played the piano.
164	00:09:51	00:09:53	And...
165	00:09:53	00:09:54	how he was murdered.
166	00:09:55	00:09:58	1966.
167	00:09:58	00:10:00	The Golden Age of Vegas.
168	00:10:00	00:10:03	The Rat Pack roamed the casinos and the Mob ran 'em.
169	00:10:03	00:10:09	Now, Ledo Wright was a hotshot young piano player from L.A., playing a week with Sinatra at the Sands.
170	00:10:09	00:10:14	Ledo was hitting on one of Sinatra's dames after the show.
171	00:10:14	00:10:18	Grazetti was an aspiring thumb-breaker for Sam Giancana.
172	00:10:18	00:10:24	The new kid in town was also from Hoboken, so, of course, he and Sinatra hit it off.
173	00:10:24	00:10:26	Grazetti would have done anything to impress Frank.
174	00:10:26	00:10:28	Grazetti was a real hothead.
175	00:10:28	00:10:29	no wallflower.
176	00:10:29	00:10:33	Both up-and-coming stars in their own worlds.
177	00:10:33	00:10:35	Things went south-- fast.
178	00:10:39	00:10:43	Ledo Wright's body was never found.
179	00:10:43	00:10:45	No body, no evidence.
180	00:10:45	00:10:47	No charges could be filed.
181	00:10:47	00:10:49	What happened to Grazetti?
182	00:10:49	00:10:50	Disappeared.
183	00:10:50	00:10:54	Until he popped up in Jersey, 20 years later.
184	00:10:54	00:10:56	But, by then, Ledo was just a distant memory.
185	00:10:56	00:10:58	Well, his piano isn't.
186	00:10:58	00:11:01	It's been going to same repair shop in Los Angeles for years.
187	00:11:01	00:11:04	Place was scheduled to receive it two days ago.
188	00:11:04	00:11:06	Moving company's called Play On Movers.
189	00:11:06	00:11:10	The night that Alison died, their truck gassed up five miles from the crime scene.
190	00:11:10	00:11:12	Who was the driver?
191	00:11:12	00:11:13	Lenny Vanders, it says here.
192	00:11:13	00:11:15	Former musician.
193	00:11:15	00:11:18	I guess all he's playing lately is Jailhouse Rock.
194	00:11:18	00:11:19	He did two tours at Ely.
195	00:11:19	00:11:21	Paroled last year.
196	00:11:21	00:11:25	Besides the piano-moving gig, he works at a store called Back When Music.
197	00:11:42	00:11:44	'56 Strat.
198	00:11:46	00:11:47	Plug you in, bro?
199	00:11:47	00:11:48	Maybe next time.
200	00:11:48	00:11:49	Are you Lenny Vanders?
201	00:11:49	00:11:51	I go by Moondog.
202	00:11:51	00:11:53	What can I do you for?
203	00:11:53	00:11:54	Do you know an Alison Bailey?
204	00:11:54	00:11:55	Nope.
205	00:11:55	00:11:56	The bells do not ring.
206	00:11:56	00:11:58	Are they ringing now?
207	00:11:58	00:11:59	Did you move this piano?
208	00:11:59	00:12:02	I move a lot of pianos.
209	00:12:02	00:12:05	Yo, Clapton, we have proof that you moved this piano in your truck.
210	00:12:05	00:12:08	Dude, look...
211	00:12:08	00:12:11	I was supposed to deliver it to L.A. for repairs.
212	00:12:11	00:12:14	The dead girl was definitely not on the shipping manifesto.
213	00:12:14	00:12:17	So how'd she get in the piano? No clue.
214	00:12:17	00:12:18	Look, I stopped to get gas.
215	00:12:18	00:12:23	I checked the piano, went to tighten the straps.
216	00:12:25	00:12:27	Next thing I know, I got a dead girl staring at me.
217	00:12:27	00:12:29	And you did the right thing.
218	00:12:29	00:12:30	You called the cops, right?
219	00:12:30	00:12:31	Look, I panicked.
220	00:12:31	00:12:32	I dumped it in the desert.
221	00:12:32	00:12:34	Who owns the piano?
222	00:12:34	00:12:36	I got it at this old theater.
223	00:12:36	00:12:38	That wasn't the question.
224	00:12:38	00:12:41	You know that Witness Protection thing?
225	00:12:41	00:12:43	Can I get in on that? How does that work?
226	00:12:43	00:12:45	Who owns the piano, Moondog?
227	00:12:45	00:12:46	Tommy Grazetti.
228	00:12:46	00:12:48	Tommy Grazetti. Yeah.
229	00:12:48	00:12:49	I thought he was hanging out in Jersey somewhere.
230	00:12:49	00:12:51	Since when did he come back to Las Vegas?
231	00:12:51	00:12:53	How am I supposed to know?
232	00:12:53	00:12:58	All I know is he runs this Rat Pack show at that theater and he used to kill people for a living.
233	00:12:58	00:12:59	Yeah, people like Ledo Wright.
234	00:12:59	00:13:01	I think Greg's onto something.
235	00:13:01	00:13:06	If Alison was looking into one of Grazetti's old murders...
236	00:13:06	00:13:07	Maybe she's a new one.
237	00:13:12	00:13:16	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Copa Room at the Sands!
238	00:13:16	00:13:23	Here they are, straight from the bar-- Dean, Sammy, and the Chairman of the Board, Frank Sinatra!
239	00:13:23	00:13:25	Whoa!
240	00:13:25	00:13:28	Hey, how are you this evening, ladies and gentlemen?
241	00:13:28	00:13:29	Ho-ho!
242	00:13:29	00:13:32	How'd all these people get in my room?
243	00:13:32	00:13:33	I got this one, boys; I got this one.
244	00:14:10	00:14:11	What a time.
245	00:14:11	00:14:13	Oh, please. You weren't even born.
246	00:14:28	00:14:30	Hey, check it out.
247	00:14:30	00:14:31	There's Ledo Wright.
248	00:14:31	00:14:34	And look at the date on the poster-- October 23, 1966.
249	00:14:34	00:14:39	Two days before Ledo was murdered by Tommy Grazetti to get in good with Frank.
250	00:14:39	00:14:42	Looks like Mr. Grazetti's still leading the good life.
251	00:14:51	00:14:53	Can I help you?
252	00:14:53	00:14:54	Yeah, as a matter of fact.
253	00:14:54	00:14:58	CSI Russell, CSI Sanders, Vegas Crime Lab.
254	00:14:58	00:14:59	We'd like to talk to a Tommy Grazetti.
255	00:14:59	00:15:01	Yeah, he's out of town.
256	00:15:01	00:15:03	So unless you got a ticket, you got to leave.
257	00:15:03	00:15:04	How's this for a ticket?
258	00:15:04	00:15:08	Hey, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much.
259	00:15:17	00:15:19	I don't know what to tell you.
260	00:15:19	00:15:21	Piano was taken out yesterday.
261	00:15:21	00:15:24	Guy took it out through the loading dock.
262	00:15:24	00:15:26	Okay. But it was right here, right?
263	00:15:26	00:15:27	More or less.
264	00:15:27	00:15:31	Do me a favor. On the way out the door, turn the lights off, will you?
265	00:15:36	00:15:38	Thank you.
266	00:15:54	00:15:57	I think we found our primary.
267	00:15:57	00:16:00	Three voids, identical.
268	00:16:00	00:16:02	What are you thinking, piano legs?
269	00:16:02	00:16:04	This is where Alison was attacked.
270	00:16:09	00:16:11	Missed a spot.
271	00:16:11	00:16:13	Blood...
272	00:16:13	00:16:15	with a strand of fiber in it.
273	00:16:16	00:16:18	Maybe trace from our killer?
274	00:16:18	00:16:19	We need some backup.
275	00:16:19	00:16:20	I'm gonna text Sara.
276	00:16:23	00:16:25	Oh, look who's here.
277	00:16:33	00:16:35	You charge extra for the cleaning?
278	00:16:35	00:16:38	Mr. Grazetti, uh, heard you were out of town.
279	00:16:38	00:16:39	Heard you wanted to talk.
280	00:16:39	00:16:41	Yeah, yeah, we do.
281	00:16:41	00:16:43	You know a lady named Alison Bailey.
282	00:16:43	00:16:44	Is that right?
283	00:16:44	00:16:46	Don't recognize the name.
284	00:16:46	00:16:49	How about the face?
285	00:16:49	00:16:51	Oh, yeah-- her. She's a nutjob.
286	00:16:51	00:16:53	A few days ago, I'm at the sports book at Caesar's.
287	00:16:53	00:16:56	I got a fresh cigar, a fresh racing form-- paradise.
288	00:16:56	00:17:00	She saddles up next to me, asks me questions about the old days.
289	00:17:00	00:17:03	I gave her the shine. Yeah, and then you shined the floor with her blood.
290	00:17:03	00:17:05	Yeah, excuse-- excuse me.
291	00:17:05	00:17:07	Um, where were you Monday night?
292	00:17:07	00:17:09	At home by myself.
293	00:17:09	00:17:10	Show's dark on Mondays.
294	00:17:10	00:17:12	She found out, didn't she?
295	00:17:12	00:17:15	She had proof that you're the one who killed Ledo Wright.
296	00:17:16	00:17:18	You're out of line, kid.
297	00:17:18	00:17:19	Yeah? And you're a killer.
298	00:17:19	00:17:20	All right, you know what?
299	00:17:20	00:17:21	Time... time-out.
300	00:17:21	00:17:24	Can I talk to you for a second, please?
301	00:17:24	00:17:25	And don't go anywhere.
302	00:17:25	00:17:26	We'll be right back.
303	00:17:29	00:17:31	What-What are you doing? The guy did it!
304	00:17:31	00:17:34	No, actually, Greg, he's a suspect.
305	00:17:34	00:17:35	There's blood all over that place!
306	00:17:35	00:17:38	All right, All the more reason to rein it in, so we can nail him.
307	00:17:38	00:17:39	Rein it in?
308	00:17:39	00:17:40	Oh, I get it.
309	00:17:40	00:17:43	When it's people that you care about, the rule book goes out the window.
310	00:17:43	00:17:47	But when it's someone who meant something to me...
311	00:17:47	00:17:50	Yeah, I should've told you.
312	00:17:50	00:17:52	Yeah, you're right, you should have.
313	00:17:53	00:17:56	And yeah, you're right.
314	00:17:57	00:18:00	When Katie was taken, I...
315	00:18:00	00:18:03	I led with my heart.
316	00:18:03	00:18:04	I didn't know what to do.
317	00:18:04	00:18:05	But I was wrong.
318	00:18:05	00:18:09	It wasn't until I stopped doing that that we were able to find her.
319	00:18:09	00:18:11	Easier said than done.
320	00:18:11	00:18:13	Yeah, tell me about it.
321	00:18:14	00:18:18	Well, I guess this is when you take me off the case.
322	00:18:18	00:18:20	Off the case, no.
323	00:18:20	00:18:23	Off the front lines, yeah.
324	00:18:23	00:18:26	You think that whatever Alison found got her killed, right?
325	00:18:26	00:18:31	So... take a deep breath and go out and find it.
326	00:18:31	00:18:34	For her.
327	00:18:34	00:18:35	Okay?
328	00:19:43	00:19:45	Hey, I don't go on for another 20.
329	00:19:45	00:19:47	Sinatra needs his rest.
330	00:19:50	00:19:51	Show's over, Frank.
331	00:19:54	00:19:56	You know, I don't know why the DMV gets this so wrong.
332	00:19:56	00:19:59	They got you down here as some schmuck named Jeff Lummet.
333	00:19:59	00:20:00	Someone gonna tell me why I'm here?
334	00:20:03	00:20:05	Oh, my God.
335	00:20:05	00:20:08	I take it you know her, Jeff? That's Alison Bailey.
336	00:20:08	00:20:10	I met her a couple years ago.
337	00:20:10	00:20:13	I helped her with her Sinatra biography.
338	00:20:13	00:20:15	Oh...
339	00:20:15	00:20:16	I'm a, I'm a memorabilia collector.
340	00:20:16	00:20:18	There were some items that she wanted to see.
341	00:20:18	00:20:20	Have you seen her more recently than that?
342	00:20:20	00:20:24	Maybe in the little love nest they have under the theater there.
343	00:20:24	00:20:26	It's not a love nest, all right?
344	00:20:26	00:20:28	It's a listening room.
345	00:20:28	00:20:30	And it's not mine, it's Tommy's.
346	00:20:30	00:20:32	So you and Tommy have a little listening room.
347	00:20:32	00:20:34	Someplace where nobody listens.
348	00:20:34	00:20:36	You were partying down there, and maybe things got out of hand.
349	00:20:36	00:20:38	Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute.
350	00:20:38	00:20:41	Whatever happened to Alison, I had nothing to do about it.
351	00:20:45	00:20:48	Oh, man. It is my fault.
352	00:20:48	00:20:50	I told her where to find Tommy.
353	00:20:50	00:20:52	At Caesars.
354	00:20:52	00:20:54	Oh! I warned her.
355	00:20:54	00:20:57	Told her not to talk to Tommy about his past.
356	00:20:57	00:20:58	It's a bad idea.
357	00:20:58	00:21:03	Laying around in blood and fibers at a crime scene-- that is a bad idea.
358	00:21:03	00:21:05	Where were you Monday night?
359	00:21:05	00:21:06	I was working at the Avalon.
360	00:21:06	00:21:08	That's a hip-hop club, Jeff.
361	00:21:08	00:21:09	I mean, they're not Sinatra fans there.
362	00:21:09	00:21:11	I wasn't singing.
363	00:21:11	00:21:13	I was spotting.
364	00:21:13	00:21:15	Here.
365	00:21:15	00:21:17	Note Seek.
366	00:21:17	00:21:20	That's an app that identifies songs.
367	00:21:20	00:21:22	Charlie actually just showed me how to use this.
368	00:21:22	00:21:24	It's really cool.
369	00:21:24	00:21:32	Note Seek has this database of songs that are catalogued by artist, year and title.
370	00:21:32	00:21:38	Then you take your app and you digitally listen to a snippet of music...
371	00:21:43	00:21:47	And then it tells you exactly what you're listening to.
372	00:21:47	00:21:50	How cool is that? I thought you were more of a Grateful Dead kind of guy.
373	00:21:50	00:21:51	No, I am, I am.
374	00:21:51	00:21:53	This is just research.
375	00:21:53	00:21:55	Barbara's the Sinatra fan.
376	00:21:55	00:22:02	This one, we actually learned how to dance to that song at an Arthur Murray studio.
377	00:22:02	00:22:04	Barbara wanted us to learn how to dance for Maya's wedding.
378	00:22:04	00:22:05	It was fun, too.
379	00:22:05	00:22:07	How are you guys doing?
380	00:22:07	00:22:09	We're good. We're good.
381	00:22:09	00:22:10	Thank you. Yeah.
382	00:22:10	00:22:13	She's still flying up to Seattle every weekend, but...
383	00:22:13	00:22:15	Well, that must be really good for Maya and Katie.
384	00:22:17	00:22:19	Yeah, I hope so.
385	00:22:19	00:22:24	So, how does Note Seek alibi Lummet?
386	00:22:24	00:22:26	I had to look that one up, actually.
387	00:22:26	00:22:35	Um... the company has these music spotters that they send out to clubs to listen and record new songs and remixes for the database.
388	00:22:35	00:22:38	And Lummet did say that he was music spotting on Monday night at the club.
389	00:22:38	00:22:42	And an exec from Note Seek confirmed his story.
390	00:22:42	00:22:45	Lummet turned in his playlist.
391	00:22:45	00:22:47	So I guess we no longer have a suspect. Guess not.
392	00:22:48	00:22:49	Oh, Lord.
393	00:22:49	00:22:51	You don't get that with MP3s, do you?
394	00:22:57	00:22:58	What?
395	00:23:00	00:23:04	I have a... I have a box cutter in that left-hand drawer.
396	00:23:04	00:23:06	Can I have it, please? Sure.
397	00:23:09	00:23:11	Forgive me, Barbara, but it's for a good cause.
398	00:23:21	00:23:23	Does that look familiar?
399	00:23:23	00:23:26	Vinyl trace Greg found in the piano.
400	00:23:26	00:23:30	Same as Doc found in the victim's wounds.
401	00:23:30	00:23:31	Vinyl tracings, box cutters...
402	00:23:31	00:23:35	Maybe a record played a part in Alison's death.
403	00:23:43	00:23:45	Wow.
404	00:23:45	00:23:48	You have done a lot of work in here, Greg.
405	00:23:48	00:23:49	None of this makes any sense.
406	00:23:49	00:23:56	I thought that Alison was researching Tommy Grazetti's involvement in the Ledo Wright murder, but there is nothing in here about Ledo Wright.
407	00:23:58	00:24:00	So what was she researching?
408	00:24:00	00:24:08	Well, she was definitely interested in Grazetti, but most of these files are about the Mob moving into drug dealing, or making inroads with the hippie crowd.
409	00:24:08	00:24:10	Tell me you got something.
410	00:24:10	00:24:11	Yeah.
411	00:24:11	00:24:13	I've got Alison's car.
412	00:24:13	00:24:17	The rental car company turned over the GPS files for the vehicle.
413	00:24:17	00:24:26	As you can see, most of her trips were right around the Strip, but on the day she was murdered, she takes a ride to an abandoned house in Henderson.
414	00:24:26	00:24:28	850 Timber Lane.
415	00:24:28	00:24:30	Yeah, does that mean something?
416	00:24:33	00:24:34	Here it is.
417	00:24:34	00:24:36	October 26, 1966.
418	00:24:36	00:24:39	Tommy Grazetti walks into 850 Timber Lane.
419	00:24:39	00:24:41	What is this, FBI surveillance? No.
420	00:24:41	00:24:43	That's Sam Braun surveillance.
421	00:24:43	00:24:45	Braun had a P.I. tailing Grazetti.
422	00:24:45	00:24:46	Well, why would Sam be following him?
423	00:24:46	00:24:48	850 Timber Lane.
424	00:24:48	00:24:51	The house was owned by a Linda Overton.
425	00:24:51	00:24:54	She was a trust-fund kid turned violent radical.
426	00:24:54	00:24:58	Robbed Braun's Rampart Casino in '66, killed two guards.
427	00:24:58	00:24:59	Died of cancer in '95.
428	00:24:59	00:25:03	The cops never found any of her co-conspirators.
429	00:25:03	00:25:05	Maybe Alison did.
430	00:25:05	00:25:07	Tommy Grazetti.
431	00:25:07	00:25:10	Yeah, this whole time I have been thinking that the Ledo Wright murder got Alison killed.
432	00:25:10	00:25:14	Maybe Tommy Grazetti was helping radicals rob a casino.
433	00:25:14	00:25:16	I've been looking at the wrong '60s.
434	00:25:23	00:25:26	You should've stayed in Jersey, Tommy.
435	00:25:26	00:25:31	But I guess everyone's past has a way of catching up to all of us, huh?
436	00:25:31	00:25:34	I don't even know what I'm looking at.
437	00:25:34	00:25:36	You're looking at a crook.
438	00:25:36	00:25:36	And a murderer.
439	00:25:36	00:25:38	Sam Braun knew it.
440	00:25:38	00:25:43	That's why he had his P.I. take that photo of you paying Linda Overton a little vist.
441	00:25:43	00:25:45	Take a look at the date stamp, there.
442	00:25:45	00:25:48	October 26, 1966.
443	00:25:48	00:25:53	That's three days before the Rampart casino was robbed and two guards were killed.
444	00:25:53	00:25:54	Tragic.
445	00:25:54	00:25:55	Historic.
446	00:25:55	00:25:56	I had nothing to do with it.
447	00:25:58	00:26:01	Just like you had nothing to do with Alison Bailey's murder.
448	00:26:01	00:26:05	Now, forget about the piano player-- Ledo Wright.
449	00:26:05	00:26:07	It was easy to make him disappear.
450	00:26:07	00:26:09	But this... ooh.
451	00:26:09	00:26:12	Well, that's a different story, isn't it?
452	00:26:12	00:26:20	I think that you hightailed it out of Vegas in '66 because you stole from Sam Braun and killed two of his boys.
453	00:26:20	00:26:27	40 years later, Alison dug up the truth, and you killed her for it.
454	00:26:27	00:26:29	I was also the guy on the grassy knoll.
455	00:26:29	00:26:31	Did you find that in her research?
456	00:26:31	00:26:33	No, but I can tell you what I think I'm gonna find.
457	00:26:33	00:26:39	The name of a co-conspirator who was in on the heist with you and Overton.
458	00:26:40	00:26:42	You like the word allegedly?
459	00:26:42	00:26:44	It's a favorite of mine.
460	00:26:44	00:26:48	Now, you just told me a little story about Vegas in '66.
461	00:26:48	00:26:49	I'll tell you one.
462	00:26:49	00:26:52	In '66, we're running the casinos.
463	00:26:52	00:26:55	Skimming, loan-sharking...
464	00:26:55	00:26:57	you know, allegedly.
465	00:26:57	00:26:59	Life is good.
466	00:26:59	00:27:01	And then Howard Hughes buys the Sands.
467	00:27:01	00:27:03	Makes it all legit.
468	00:27:03	00:27:06	Not even Sinatra could get comp'd.
469	00:27:06	00:27:09	Yeah, sure, we still hit the Sands every day.
470	00:27:09	00:27:12	But not like players, kings-- no.
471	00:27:12	00:27:17	All we could do was play the nickel slots like a bunch of old ladies.
472	00:27:17	00:27:21	We had to come up with a different revenue source-- drugs.
473	00:27:22	00:27:23	Allegedly.
474	00:27:23	00:27:28	You're telling me you're a drug dealer, not a murderer.
475	00:27:28	00:27:30	I'm not telling you anything.
476	00:27:30	00:27:34	Except for Linda Overton was one hot hippie piece of ass.
477	00:27:58	00:28:00	Do you play weddings, too?
478	00:28:01	00:28:04	I'm not playing, dawg.
479	00:28:04	00:28:05	I'm cleaning.
480	00:28:07	00:28:08	What are you talking about?
481	00:28:08	00:28:13	Well, as much as it pains me to admit, I was wrong about the glue that he found in the piano.
482	00:28:13	00:28:16	I think our killer used it to clean a record.
483	00:28:16	00:28:18	Wouldn't that mess the record up?
484	00:28:20	00:28:27	You take one LP album, add four ounces of store-bought hide glue.
485	00:28:31	00:28:36	Spread evenly across the vinyl.
486	00:28:36	00:28:40	In time, dust and particles affix to the glue.
487	00:28:40	00:28:49	After the glue dries, you take a handy box cutter, and use it to pry the glue off of the record.
488	00:28:49	00:28:51	And...
489	00:28:51	00:28:54	voilà, a perfectly clean record.
490	00:28:54	00:28:59	You also got a perfect negative of the record's grooves, just like these.
491	00:28:59	00:29:03	We got the grooves, why don't we just play the damn thing?
492	00:29:03	00:29:06	Name That Tune, name that killer.
493	00:29:26	00:29:30	I was able to assemble and reconstruct four separate audio segments from the glue.
494	00:29:30	00:29:32	This is what I got.
495	00:29:32	00:29:33	Track One.
496	00:29:35	00:29:36	Live album, maybe?
497	00:29:36	00:29:38	Track Two.
498	00:29:39	00:29:41	Jazz, maybe?
499	00:29:41	00:29:43	There were vocals, too.
500	00:29:43	00:29:44	Track Three.
501	00:29:46	00:29:49	I got the most out of this track.
502	00:29:51	00:29:52	That's all I got.
503	00:29:52	00:29:57	I mean, if it were a Radiohead song, I could help you, but... No, wait a minute, wait a minute, I... let me use my app here.
504	00:29:57	00:29:58	God, I love this thing.
505	00:29:58	00:30:02	Play it again, Sara.
506	00:30:04	00:30:05	Ah!
507	00:30:05	00:30:07	Sinatra at the Sands.
508	00:30:07	00:30:09	Classic album.
509	00:30:09	00:30:13	Seems whenever this case takes a turn, it's always back to 1966.
510	00:30:22	00:30:23	Taking a music break?
511	00:30:23	00:30:25	Listen to this.
512	00:30:25	00:30:29	Yeah, sure, we still hit the Sands every day.
513	00:30:29	00:30:32	But not like players, kings-- no.
514	00:30:32	00:30:34	Grazetti's interrogation?
515	00:30:34	00:30:36	Yeah. I've been listening to it for the last couple hours.
516	00:30:36	00:30:38	The guy's lying.
517	00:30:38	00:30:40	You didn't expect him to admit to killing Alison.
518	00:30:40	00:30:42	No, I'm not talking about Alison.
519	00:30:42	00:30:44	I'm talking about the Sands in '66.
520	00:30:44	00:30:47	Grazetti said that he was hanging with the boys in the casino.
521	00:30:49	00:30:50	That's impossible.
522	00:30:50	00:30:51	Why?
523	00:30:51	00:30:52	The Vegas Black Book.
524	00:30:52	00:30:55	It's a list of all the people banned by the Gaming Commission.
525	00:30:55	00:30:59	In 1965, Tommy Grazetti was busted for counting cards.
526	00:30:59	00:31:02	He was banned from the Sands after that.
527	00:31:02	00:31:05	So there's no way he was hanging with the boys in the casino.
528	00:31:05	00:31:06	But why would he lie about that?
529	00:31:06	00:31:09	Maybe... he forgot.
530	00:31:09	00:31:14	Trust me, guys like Grazetti don't forget about their Vegas glory days.
531	00:31:14	00:31:18	In fact, they spend more time living in the past than in the present.
532	00:31:18	00:31:23	Kind of... sounds like you're talking about yourself more than Grazetti.
533	00:31:23	00:31:25	What's that supposed to mean?
534	00:31:25	00:31:27	Greg...
535	00:31:27	00:31:30	your... passion for Vegas history is awesome.
536	00:31:32	00:31:34	It makes you a better CSI, right?
537	00:31:36	00:31:38	And... I'm...
538	00:31:38	00:31:42	the last person who should be giving relationship advice, but...
539	00:31:42	00:31:44	I mean, look at you, you're...
540	00:31:44	00:31:48	you're a hot guy; you're smart, you're funny, you're... a total catch.
541	00:31:49	00:31:54	What I'm saying is... with Alison, with your obsession with the past, maybe...
542	00:31:55	00:31:58	...you should stop looking back, you know? Try...
543	00:31:58	00:32:00	moving forward.
544	00:32:04	00:32:06	You're right.
545	00:32:07	00:32:10	You are the last person who should be giving relationship advice.
546	00:32:12	00:32:20	All I'm saying is, with my parents' divorce, I couldn't get past it; I-I thought of my father as this one guy, and...
547	00:32:20	00:32:22	I came to realize he was a completely different person.
548	00:32:23	00:32:25	You know, maybe... Wait.
549	00:32:25	00:32:27	What you just said.
550	00:32:35	00:32:36	Thank you.
551	00:32:40	00:32:42	You're welcome.
552	00:33:14	00:33:18	I think you're gonna be a little late for that show.
553	00:33:18	00:33:19	Yeah, well, not for Ledo Wright's thumbprint.
554	00:33:21	00:33:23	You're kidding me.
555	00:33:23	00:33:25	A 46-year-old print?
556	00:33:25	00:33:28	You're gonna make the Journal of Forensic Science.
557	00:33:28	00:33:30	I'm gonna make more than that, bubby.
558	00:33:30	00:33:32	Look at that photo of Ledo Wright.
559	00:33:32	00:33:34	See the ring on his finger? Yeah.
560	00:33:34	00:33:37	Ledo always wore an Irish Claddagh ring.
561	00:33:37	00:33:41	Now, I blew up this photo of Tommy Grazetti in front of Linda Overton's house.
562	00:33:41	00:33:43	What's on his hand?
563	00:33:43	00:33:46	An Irish Claddagh ring.
564	00:33:46	00:33:47	What is Grazetti doing with an Irish ring?
565	00:33:47	00:33:49	He's Italian as pasta.
566	00:33:49	00:33:51	Because it's the same guy.
567	00:33:51	00:33:55	So maybe it's the other way around-- maybe Ledo Wright killed Grazetti.
568	00:33:55	00:33:56	And assumed his identity.
569	00:33:56	00:33:58	It's a good story.
570	00:33:58	00:34:00	One I am going to prove.
571	00:34:00	00:34:05	Now, Nick already got Grazetti's print when he brought him in, and now we have Ledo Wright's print from the poster.
572	00:34:08	00:34:10	Wow.
573	00:34:10	00:34:13	Hey, that's great work, Greg.
574	00:34:13	00:34:15	For 46 years, Ledo's been hiding.
575	00:34:15	00:34:17	Alison found him, and that got her killed.
576	00:34:17	00:34:22	The guy putting on the fake Rat Pack show is the biggest fake of 'em all.
577	00:34:58	00:35:01	That's a Ledo Wright flourish if I ever heard one.
578	00:35:01	00:35:08	Same build, same looks, a few nips and tucks.
579	00:35:08	00:35:11	But you couldn't change your fingerprints.
580	00:35:11	00:35:13	It all made sense.
581	00:35:13	00:35:15	The legend.
582	00:35:15	00:35:18	Gangster kills piano player.
583	00:35:19	00:35:20	But Alison...
584	00:35:20	00:35:23	discovered the truth.
585	00:35:25	00:35:27	I didn't kill Allison.
586	00:35:27	00:35:30	I didn't kill anyone.
587	00:35:30	00:35:33	Not wanting to kill is how this whole damn thing got started.
588	00:35:33	00:35:35	1966 was a...
589	00:35:35	00:35:44	a very good year for an up-and-coming piano player, but a very bad year if you drew the wrong number in the draft.
590	00:35:44	00:35:47	I thought my only choice was to go to Canada.
591	00:35:47	00:35:49	And then... (chuckles)
592	00:35:49	00:35:51	fate stepped in.
593	00:35:51	00:35:54	It was just another night in paradise, hanging out with the boys.
594	00:35:54	00:36:00	Yeah, Tommy and I, we had our differences, but we made up.
595	00:36:00	00:36:05	We always told Tommy, Swallow first, then flap your gums.
596	00:36:06	00:36:09	It all happened so fast.
597	00:36:09	00:36:10	Tommy, get up, man. What are you doing?
598	00:36:10	00:36:14	We tried to revive Tommy, but it was no use.
599	00:36:14	00:36:17	He was gone.
600	00:36:17	00:36:21	And I was supposed to report for basic training in two days.
601	00:36:21	00:36:24	And the boys, they come up with this crazy idea.
602	00:36:24	00:36:30	And the more I thought about it, the less crazy it got.
603	00:36:30	00:36:33	Tommy was the same height, same build.
604	00:36:33	00:36:39	I dyed my hair, made a few adjustments.
605	00:36:40	00:36:41	Showtime.
606	00:36:41	00:36:43	Why'd you come back to town?
607	00:36:43	00:36:45	Vegas.
608	00:36:45	00:36:48	At least the Vegas I remember.
609	00:36:48	00:36:53	Frank and the boys, the songs... the attitude.
610	00:36:55	00:36:57	Man, it was magic.
611	00:36:57	00:37:06	And now... I get to bring that back to life every night... right here.
612	00:37:06	00:37:09	Ledo Wright's story checked out.
613	00:37:09	00:37:11	He put me onto a 1966 John Doe.
614	00:37:11	00:37:14	asphyxiation due to...
615	00:37:14	00:37:16	...chicken bone. And you believe this guy?
616	00:37:16	00:37:19	Well, I believe Ledo Wright isn't a killer.
617	00:37:19	00:37:22	Well, hell, somebody cut up that girl and put her in the piano.
618	00:37:22	00:37:27	Hey, guys, I've been doing some research on our album, Sinatra at the Sands.
619	00:37:27	00:37:29	Turns out it is a very rare pressing.
620	00:37:29	00:37:30	Go on.
621	00:37:30	00:37:34	Every vinyl record is imprinted with a stamped I.D. on the lead-out groove.
622	00:37:34	00:37:39	And that I.D. can be used to trace it to the manufacturer or the label.
623	00:37:39	00:37:42	You remember the number sequence that we found in Alison's appointment book?
624	00:37:42	00:37:44	It's the same number.
625	00:37:44	00:37:46	It says here they only pressed a thousand copies.
626	00:37:46	00:37:48	And only one store in town sells it.
627	00:37:51	00:37:54	What's up, Moondog?
628	00:37:54	00:37:56	Came back for the Strat? Sweet.
629	00:37:56	00:37:58	Actually, I'm looking for a record.
630	00:37:58	00:38:01	A very rare pressing of Sinatra at the Sands.
631	00:38:01	00:38:03	I know.
632	00:38:03	00:38:04	You move a lot of records.
633	00:38:04	00:38:06	You got that right, dude.
634	00:38:06	00:38:08	But I did move that, couple days ago.
635	00:38:08	00:38:10	I got it right here.
636	00:38:10	00:38:12	Yep.
637	00:38:12	00:38:14	Jeff Lummet.
638	00:38:14	00:38:15	Jeff Lummet?
639	00:38:15	00:38:16	The Sinatra impersonator.
640	00:38:16	00:38:18	That's the guy.
641	00:38:18	00:38:21	He said it was a gift for-- his words-- a hot dame.
642	00:38:23	00:38:24	What a tool.
643	00:38:24	00:38:26	And you would know.
644	00:38:26	00:38:28	So what?
645	00:38:28	00:38:29	I bought a Sinatra record.
646	00:38:29	00:38:33	A guy like you's got every Sinatra record ever made.
647	00:38:33	00:38:34	No, no, no, not this one.
648	00:38:34	00:38:36	This is 180-gram vinyl.
649	00:38:36	00:38:38	It's like he's whispering in your ear.
650	00:38:38	00:38:41	Must be great to impress a girl.
651	00:38:41	00:38:44	Yeah, Moondog already told us that you gave it to a hot dame.
652	00:38:44	00:38:47	You want to tell us where you really were Monday night?
653	00:38:47	00:38:48	(scoffs) I already told you.
654	00:38:48	00:38:52	That's right. You were recording some songs using Note Seek?
655	00:38:52	00:38:54	They gave us a copy, I think, of the playlist.
656	00:38:54	00:39:00	And the D.J. gave us his playlist from Monday night, so, let's play the music and dance.
657	00:39:05	00:39:07	Does not compute.
658	00:39:07	00:39:09	Unknown song. How about that? Ah.
659	00:39:09	00:39:14	That one single song the DJ played is in Note Seek's database.
660	00:39:14	00:39:15	You weren't there, Jeff.
661	00:39:15	00:39:22	I mean, why would a beautiful, smart girl like Alison go out with a guy like you?
662	00:39:22	00:39:27	You're a two-bit impersonator, working a nostalgia act worse than a cruise ship.
663	00:39:27	00:39:29	Hey, I beat out hundreds of Broadway stars to be Frank.
664	00:39:29	00:39:31	You want to know how?! I'm dying to know.
665	00:39:31	00:39:33	He thinks he's as good as Frank Sinatra.
666	00:39:33	00:39:35	Better.
667	00:39:35	00:39:38	As good. As good.
668	00:39:38	00:39:41	You know, chicks hear me, and I feel sorry for them.
669	00:39:41	00:39:44	Their seats puddle when they hear what Jeff Lummet's got.
670	00:39:44	00:39:46	You're an impersonator. You're Jeff Lummet.
671	00:39:46	00:39:48	You're not Francis Albert Sinatra.
672	00:39:48	00:39:50	You're not even in the same area code.
673	00:39:50	00:39:51	Let's get back to the girl.
674	00:39:51	00:39:55	So, you say you met her a couple years ago, and you were helping her with a book, right?
675	00:39:55	00:39:57	I had my hands full with a redhead at the time.
676	00:39:57	00:40:00	I must have broken her heart.
677	00:40:00	00:40:03	So, what, she forgets about you, and she doesn't call you when she comes to town?
678	00:40:03	00:40:05	Is that it? She called me plenty.
679	00:40:05	00:40:08	She needed help finding one of Frank's records.
680	00:40:08	00:40:14	Sinatra at the Sands, and you're the go-to guy on all things Frank, right?
681	00:40:14	00:40:16	I told her to meet me backstage after the show.
682	00:40:16	00:40:19	Yeah? To give her the record.
683	00:40:19	00:40:21	Right. Get it all nice and cleaned up.
684	00:40:21	00:40:22	Uh-huh.
685	00:40:22	00:40:23	And she says it's not even for her.
686	00:40:23	00:40:28	A surprise gift for some guy named Greg.
687	00:40:28	00:40:31	Turns out she hooked up with him a couple years ago, still has feelings for him.
688	00:40:31	00:40:34	Or some... I mean, what the... what the hell, right?
689	00:40:34	00:40:37	The Chairman of the Board got played.
690	00:40:37	00:40:40	The guy who's better than Frank, right? You're damn right.
691	00:40:40	00:40:42	I did her a favor, and she spits in my face.
692	00:40:42	00:40:44	She spits in my face!
693	00:40:44	00:40:46	Yeah. Did she not know how things are done?
694	00:40:46	00:40:48	How we do things here?
695	00:40:48	00:40:49	Right. How are things done... Frank?
696	00:40:50	00:40:53	They're done my way.
697	00:40:53	00:40:56	Well, it's a surprise... just for you.
698	00:40:56	00:40:59	It's not for me. It's for my friend Greg.
699	00:41:01	00:41:03	What? What?
700	00:41:17	00:41:18	How's this sound?
701	00:41:18	00:41:20	Huh? How's this sound?!
702	00:41:37	00:41:39	You okay?
703	00:41:39	00:41:41	Yeah, I'm fine.
