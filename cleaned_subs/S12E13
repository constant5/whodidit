0,00:00:10,00:00:14,WOMAN: I've never seen so much money spent on so little actual fabric.
1,00:00:14,00:00:17,"Well, you're always saying it's what's inside that counts, right?"
2,00:00:17,00:00:18,Yeah.
3,00:00:18,00:00:20,Look where that gets me.
4,00:00:20,00:00:23,"Look, well, maybe you should try wearing something less ""granny"" than the flannel PJ's."
5,00:00:23,00:00:25,"Hey, they keep me warm!"
6,00:00:25,00:00:27,"You know what else can keep you warm? Yeah, coffee."
7,00:00:27,00:00:31,(laughs) There's a place on the third floor. I'll pay.
8,00:00:31,00:00:32,"Oh, man, I just can't decide..."
9,00:00:32,00:00:36,"No, I mean, if you just wait two weeks, you can get it online for, like, half the price."
10,00:00:36,00:00:38,"Yeah, but you're missing the point-- I want it now."
11,00:00:38,00:00:40,Fine. So pay the money.
12,00:00:40,00:00:42,No. You're right. I'll wait.
13,00:00:42,00:00:44,You're always right.
14,00:00:44,00:00:47,"So we'll go get coffee, and then we'll go back and get it."
15,00:01:04,00:01:06,(baby fussing)
16,00:01:08,00:01:11,Aw...
17,00:01:13,00:01:16,So cute. (giggles)
18,00:01:16,00:01:17,(laughs)
19,00:01:17,00:01:18,(laughs)
20,00:01:26,00:01:28,(elevator bell dings)
21,00:01:46,00:01:48,We said we'd be there at 4:00.
22,00:01:48,00:01:49,Do you think we'll make it?
23,00:01:49,00:01:51,"Oh, we'll get there by 4:00."
24,00:01:53,00:01:54,"Eva, your hair..."
25,00:01:54,00:01:57,What? There's a huge piece missing out of the middle of your hair!
26,00:01:57,00:01:59,What?! What?! Somebody's cut it.
27,00:01:59,00:02:00,I have no idea.
28,00:02:00,00:02:02,Would you...? Where? Where?
29,00:02:02,00:02:03,How much is it?
30,00:02:03,00:02:05,How much is it? I don't know. I don't know.
31,00:02:05,00:02:06,How much is taken off?
32,00:02:06,00:02:08,I feel so violated.
33,00:02:08,00:02:09,(camera shutter clicks)
34,00:02:09,00:02:11,"I would, too."
35,00:02:11,00:02:13,"I mean, it's sick."
36,00:02:13,00:02:15,Isn't it?
37,00:02:15,00:02:17,Yeah.
38,00:02:17,00:02:18,"BRASS: Four days ago, a girl in a mall."
39,00:02:18,00:02:20,"Now, this girl, in a movie theater."
40,00:02:20,00:02:21,That makes 11.
41,00:02:21,00:02:23,At least that have reported it.
42,00:02:23,00:02:24,I'm sure there's more.
43,00:02:24,00:02:28,The sheriff is pissed; bad for the tourist trade.
44,00:02:28,00:02:32,It's the same story-- chunk of hair cut off in a public place.
45,00:02:32,00:02:33,They never even feel it.
46,00:02:33,00:02:34,Any of the women see anything?
47,00:02:34,00:02:35,"So far, no."
48,00:02:35,00:02:37,Guy's a ghost.
49,00:02:37,00:02:40,"Yeah. Well, at least I have nothing to worry about."
50,00:02:40,00:02:42,(chuckles): Yeah.
51,00:02:42,00:02:43,The whole thing is creepy.
52,00:02:48,00:02:50,"Ms. Bingham, this is CSI Russell."
53,00:02:50,00:02:52,Thanks for coming in.
54,00:02:53,00:02:56,"This shouldn't take too much longer, right?"
55,00:02:56,00:03:01,"I'm just gonna run a comb through a couple of times, look for some loose-cut hairs."
56,00:03:01,00:03:03,It could help us out a lot. So...
57,00:03:03,00:03:05,you were sitting in a movie theater.
58,00:03:05,00:03:07,That's right.
59,00:03:07,00:03:09,Wow. I haven't been to the movies for so long.
60,00:03:09,00:03:11,Which one was it?
61,00:03:11,00:03:12,Excuse me?
62,00:03:12,00:03:14,You a Matt Damon fan? (laughs softly)
63,00:03:14,00:03:16,Uh...
64,00:03:16,00:03:18,I'm a... Daniel Craig girl.
65,00:03:18,00:03:19,"Me, too."
66,00:03:19,00:03:22,"RUSSELL: The, uh, tuxedo and the gun, right?"
67,00:03:22,00:03:23,Hard to beat.
68,00:03:23,00:03:26,"So, Paula, you want to tell me what happened?"
69,00:03:26,00:03:32,"I-I didn't... I didn't realize it until I got home, so he must have cut it during the movie."
70,00:03:32,00:03:33,But I don't get it. Why my hair?
71,00:03:33,00:03:36,"Honestly, I have no idea."
72,00:03:36,00:03:37,You do have great hair.
73,00:03:37,00:03:38,"(laughs) RUSSELL: Well, there is that."
74,00:03:38,00:03:40,You didn't get a look at the guy?
75,00:03:40,00:03:42,No. Just...
76,00:03:42,00:03:44,Daniel Craig.
77,00:03:44,00:03:45,(chuckles)
78,00:03:45,00:03:46,I'm all done.
79,00:03:46,00:03:48,"Yeah, I just have one more question."
80,00:03:48,00:03:50,Anything else strange happen lately?
81,00:03:50,00:03:51,"You know, purse stolen?"
82,00:03:51,00:03:53,Missing keys? Tires slashed?
83,00:03:53,00:03:55,No. Okay.
84,00:03:55,00:03:57,"Good, good."
85,00:03:57,00:03:58,"Well, I am glad to hear that."
86,00:03:58,00:04:06,"Okay. Uh, bottom line, some creep took your hair-- don't let him mess with your head."
87,00:04:07,00:04:08,Thanks. I'll see you out.
88,00:04:10,00:04:11,Hold on a second.
89,00:04:11,00:04:14,Let me give you... let me give you one of these.
90,00:04:14,00:04:15,Call me...
91,00:04:15,00:04:17,"if you, if you need anything."
92,00:04:17,00:04:18,Thanks.
93,00:04:18,00:04:19,Yeah.
94,00:04:21,00:04:23,Well...
95,00:04:23,00:04:25,looks like she feels better.
96,00:04:25,00:04:27,"And based on your performance in there, so do I."
97,00:04:27,00:04:29,(phone beeps)
98,00:04:29,00:04:33,"Yeah, I just hope this little fetish doesn't turn into something more."
99,00:04:36,00:04:38,You should start playing the ponies.
100,00:04:45,00:04:48,(thunder rumbles)
101,00:04:59,00:05:01,(thunder rumbles)
102,00:05:06,00:05:12,"BRASS: ""The Most Beautiful Girl in the World."" A little mood music, I guess."
103,00:05:12,00:05:14,Hell of a mood to set.
104,00:05:18,00:05:21,Eva Byron.
105,00:05:21,00:05:25,"Four days ago, she and her sister filed a police report."
106,00:05:25,00:05:28,Our hair freak took a souvenir at the mall.
107,00:05:28,00:05:29,I guess it wasn't enough.
108,00:05:29,00:05:31,Not anymore.
109,00:05:31,00:05:33,He made her a blonde.
110,00:05:40,00:05:43,(Brass groans)
111,00:05:43,00:05:45,He took her eyes.
112,00:05:45,00:05:47,That sick bastard.
113,00:05:47,00:05:48,Why?
114,00:05:48,00:05:50,Hell with why.
115,00:05:50,00:05:51,I want to know who.
116,00:06:44,00:06:47,Guy gave her a pretty freaky makeover.
117,00:06:47,00:06:51,Liver temp puts T.O.D. around 10:00 p.m.
118,00:06:51,00:06:53,Cause of death?
119,00:06:53,00:06:56,"Other than her eyes, there's no apparent wound or trauma."
120,00:06:56,00:06:58,You'll have to wait till autopsy.
121,00:06:58,00:07:00,He blinded her.
122,00:07:00,00:07:02,SIDLE: What do you think?
123,00:07:02,00:07:04,Killer didn't want her to see him.
124,00:07:04,00:07:06,PHILLIPS: There's something in her mouth.
125,00:07:06,00:07:08,Please don't be her eyes.
126,00:07:16,00:07:18,"Oh, that's nasty."
127,00:07:21,00:07:23,Hair braid.
128,00:07:23,00:07:25,Shoved down her throat.
129,00:07:25,00:07:27,Could be our C.O.D.
130,00:07:27,00:07:29,Definitely a calling card.
131,00:07:41,00:07:43,(sighs)
132,00:07:44,00:07:46,Have you talked to Catherine?
133,00:07:46,00:07:49,"Yeah. Yeah, have you?"
134,00:07:49,00:07:51,Yeah.
135,00:07:51,00:07:53,"She, uh, sounded good."
136,00:07:53,00:07:55,Yeah.
137,00:07:55,00:07:57,"She'll show those FBI boys how to fly straight, huh?"
138,00:07:57,00:07:59,She did it for me.
139,00:07:59,00:08:01,She did it for all of us.
140,00:08:01,00:08:03,"Well, Quantico isn't that far, right?"
141,00:08:03,00:08:05,(chuckles)
142,00:08:05,00:08:07,"No, not really."
143,00:08:11,00:08:14,"Well, that can't be good."
144,00:08:14,00:08:18,"So, our hair fetish freak is now a homicidal maniac."
145,00:08:18,00:08:19,"Eh, that's just great."
146,00:08:19,00:08:21,What do we know?
147,00:08:21,00:08:24,11 women have come forward to report they were snipped by this guy.
148,00:08:24,00:08:26,Including the dead girl? Yeah.
149,00:08:26,00:08:28,I got my guys doing welfare checks on the other ten.
150,00:08:28,00:08:31,But we need to assume that there are more women out there that didn't report it.
151,00:08:31,00:08:34,"Well, let's hope they're just shy, not dead, too."
152,00:08:34,00:08:37,"Well, best way to know that is to reach out to the press."
153,00:08:37,00:08:40,And create a panic? In my city?
154,00:08:40,00:08:42,I got enough problems.
155,00:08:42,00:08:44,"This one, you need to solve."
156,00:08:48,00:08:52,I think she was looking at you when she said that.
157,00:08:52,00:08:54,"(chuckling): Yeah, right."
158,00:09:03,00:09:06,"Chain is busted, but the lock is intact."
159,00:09:06,00:09:09,She trusted him enough to open the door to him.
160,00:09:19,00:09:22,Never had a chance to realize her mistake.
161,00:09:23,00:09:25,"(loud thud, cracking)"
162,00:09:25,00:09:30,"Looks like this is where he did his extreme makeover, psychopath edition."
163,00:09:31,00:09:33,(sighs)
164,00:09:33,00:09:36,Blow-dryer and curling iron are still plugged in.
165,00:09:36,00:09:39,Traces of makeup and hair dye in the sink.
166,00:09:39,00:09:41,So he snipped Eva's hair at the mall.
167,00:09:41,00:09:43,"Obviously, he was attracted to it for some reason."
168,00:09:43,00:09:45,Certainly not the color.
169,00:09:45,00:09:47,He turned her into a blonde.
170,00:09:47,00:09:48,You should watch yourself.
171,00:09:48,00:09:49,"Well, he dyed her hair."
172,00:09:49,00:09:51,You should watch yourself.
173,00:09:51,00:09:52,True.
174,00:09:54,00:09:56,Where is the packaging?
175,00:09:56,00:09:58,You know? The products?
176,00:09:58,00:10:00,Guess he was smart enough to take them with him.
177,00:10:00,00:10:03,"Smart enough to wipe down his prints, too."
178,00:10:03,00:10:04,Suggests planning.
179,00:10:04,00:10:07,"Guy's not just sick, he's dangerous."
180,00:10:09,00:10:15,"WOMAN: When we reported what happened at the mall, the officer said it was just some weirdo, and now my sister..."
181,00:10:17,00:10:19,I'm sorry for your loss.
182,00:10:19,00:10:22,"It's the same guy, isn't it?"
183,00:10:24,00:10:25,You people should have warned us.
184,00:10:25,00:10:29,"Listen, if I could bring your sister back, I would."
185,00:10:29,00:10:35,"But I need your help right now, so we can keep this from happening to someone else, okay?"
186,00:10:37,00:10:38,Yeah.
187,00:10:38,00:10:43,"Now, after the mall incident, did your sister receive any strange phone calls?"
188,00:10:43,00:10:45,Did she think somebody was following her?
189,00:10:45,00:10:47,Anything like that? No.
190,00:10:48,00:10:50,Do you recognize this dress?
191,00:10:52,00:10:54,Those sunglasses?
192,00:10:54,00:10:55,No. Why?
193,00:10:55,00:10:58,Your sister was wearing them when we found her.
194,00:10:58,00:11:00,Those aren't hers.
195,00:11:00,00:11:01,You sure? I know Eva's style.
196,00:11:01,00:11:03,She hated retro.
197,00:11:03,00:11:05,"Even as a kid, she refused to wear hand-me-downs."
198,00:11:07,00:11:09,He dressed her up?!
199,00:11:10,00:11:12,What else did he do to her?
200,00:11:12,00:11:21,"ROBBINS: I found no sign of sexual assault, and besides the facial lacerations caused by the door, there were no other apparent injuries perimortem."
201,00:11:21,00:11:24,So the eyes were gouged out postmortem?
202,00:11:24,00:11:28,"Tissue is withdrawn, nonresponsive."
203,00:11:28,00:11:29,Cause of death?
204,00:11:29,00:11:32,"Well, it wasn't the braid in her throat."
205,00:11:32,00:11:34,She died of a morphine overdose.
206,00:11:34,00:11:37,The killer injected her in the carotid artery.
207,00:11:37,00:11:40,Death was relatively quick.
208,00:11:40,00:11:43,"Boy, I didn't see that one coming."
209,00:11:43,00:11:52,"Okay, so our guy forces his way in, kills her, then he has his fun-- eyes, makeover, braid down the throat."
210,00:11:52,00:11:55,And that wasn't the only hair he left behind.
211,00:11:55,00:12:00,The killer used hair extensions to repair the area he'd cut off in the elevator.
212,00:12:00,00:12:04,Not quite the same shade as the dye job.
213,00:12:04,00:12:06,So what do you think it all means?
214,00:12:06,00:12:09,He breaks her so he can fix her?
215,00:13:07,00:13:13,You ever see that Japanese movie The Ring about that creepy girl who lives in a well and vomits hair?
216,00:13:13,00:13:16,I thought the only Japanese culture that you knew about was octopus porn.
217,00:13:16,00:13:19,You should be nicer to me.
218,00:13:19,00:13:20,Why?
219,00:13:20,00:13:21,I'll tell you.
220,00:13:22,00:13:27,The braid you fished out of your victim I sorted and meticulously measured.
221,00:13:27,00:13:34,"Henry ran mitochondrial DNA, and it turns out that the hairs in the braid are from 26 different women."
222,00:13:34,00:13:35,Twenty-six?
223,00:13:35,00:13:39,Including the 11 who reported having their locks snipped by our hair stalker.
224,00:13:39,00:13:42,I know what you're thinking-- holy hairball.
225,00:13:42,00:13:44,That's not what I'm thinking.
226,00:13:44,00:13:46,"What I'm thinking is, this braid may be more than a calling card."
227,00:13:46,00:13:48,Like a list of future victims?
228,00:13:48,00:13:49,"If you're braided, you're branded."
229,00:13:49,00:13:50,Mm.
230,00:13:50,00:13:52,Still doesn't tell us who's next.
231,00:13:52,00:13:54,HODGES: So what do we do?
232,00:13:54,00:13:58,Follow up with the list of names we do know and see if anyone's noticed someone looking over their shoulder.
233,00:14:05,00:14:07,SHERIFF: Don't need to be a profiler to see it.
234,00:14:07,00:14:11,"RUSSELL: Slender, 20s, long hair..."
235,00:14:11,00:14:14,and these are just the ones we know about.
236,00:14:19,00:14:21,How are we supposed to protect these girls?
237,00:14:21,00:14:25,"Well, we can't put a car 24-7 in front of every house."
238,00:14:25,00:14:26,You just need to catch this guy.
239,00:14:26,00:14:30,Any no-shows among the women who came forward?
240,00:14:30,00:14:31,"Yeah, one: Joyce Debernardi."
241,00:14:31,00:14:33,Henderson address.
242,00:14:33,00:14:35,"I left a, a message on her cell."
243,00:14:35,00:14:38,(ringtone playing)
244,00:14:38,00:14:39,Brass.
245,00:14:39,00:14:42,He was checking up on her.
246,00:14:42,00:14:43,"Hey, Jim."
247,00:14:43,00:14:45,(sighs)
248,00:14:47,00:14:50,Joyce Debernardi just showed up.
249,00:15:01,00:15:03,SIDLE: Day shift got the call.
250,00:15:03,00:15:06,"Similar crime scene, same M.O."
251,00:15:06,00:15:08,RUSSELL: She was found just like this?
252,00:15:08,00:15:11,Déjà vu all over again.
253,00:15:13,00:15:15,Not quite.
254,00:15:15,00:15:19,Eva's eyes were gouged out.
255,00:15:19,00:15:20,This is different.
256,00:15:20,00:15:23,Proteins in the cornea are coagulated.
257,00:15:23,00:15:26,Bastard used ammonia to blind her.
258,00:15:30,00:15:34,(screams)
259,00:15:35,00:15:40,"They, uh, found vomit in close proximity to the body."
260,00:15:40,00:15:41,Reaction to the chemical.
261,00:15:41,00:15:43,"Unlike Eva, she was alive when he did this."
262,00:15:43,00:15:44,Alive but helpless.
263,00:15:44,00:15:48,They also found partially digested pills-- Succinylcholine in vomitus.
264,00:15:48,00:15:51,That's a paralytic.
265,00:15:51,00:15:52,That's how he's getting better at the makeup.
266,00:15:52,00:15:54,(panting)
267,00:15:57,00:15:59,(gasping quietly)
268,00:15:59,00:16:01,"He's taking his time, he's savoring it."
269,00:16:01,00:16:03,He's getting more confident.
270,00:16:03,00:16:06,Which means he's getting harder to catch.
271,00:16:15,00:16:16,(weak breathing)
272,00:16:22,00:16:24,(weakly): Help...
273,00:16:48,00:16:56,"Two women-- both have their hair cut by this nut-job, now they're dead, dressed up like some '70s fantasy."
274,00:16:56,00:16:59,When did we get the first report of this guy cutting hair?
275,00:17:00,00:17:01,"Three weeks ago, Sheriff."
276,00:17:01,00:17:02,Three weeks?
277,00:17:02,00:17:04,Clearly he didn't just step over the line.
278,00:17:04,00:17:06,This guy's escalating. Fast.
279,00:17:06,00:17:07,What are you two doing about it?
280,00:17:07,00:17:10,"Well, right now, we're listening 'cause he's, he's talking to us."
281,00:17:10,00:17:12,"He's sending letters now, what?"
282,00:17:12,00:17:17,"No, these... found in the throats of our two victims."
283,00:17:17,00:17:22,"That braid has hair from 26 different women, including our two murdered ones."
284,00:17:22,00:17:24,He's given us a list of who he's going after.
285,00:17:24,00:17:30,"11 of the names we know, 15 we don't-- women whose hair has been cut but they never came forward to report it."
286,00:17:30,00:17:34,All of these women are in danger and they all deserve to know it.
287,00:17:36,00:17:38,"I came here to be briefed, not told what to do."
288,00:17:38,00:17:41,"I understand, but I think we need to go to the press."
289,00:17:41,00:17:46,"You know, any panic this may cause-- it's worth it if we can save just, just one life."
290,00:17:48,00:17:50,I'll talk to the mayor.
291,00:17:50,00:17:51,Thank you.
292,00:17:51,00:17:52,That's my job.
293,00:17:52,00:17:54,Do yours.
294,00:17:55,00:18:03,"HODGES: Dresses our victims were found in are both vintage, no retro imitations, the real deal, circa 1978."
295,00:18:03,00:18:05,(snickers) What?
296,00:18:05,00:18:07,"I... I can't talk to you behind that dress, man."
297,00:18:07,00:18:09,Looks like you're wearing that thing.
298,00:18:09,00:18:10,Oh. (chuckles)
299,00:18:10,00:18:13,"So, '70s, huh, you sure about that?"
300,00:18:13,00:18:14,"Yeah, I spoke with an expert."
301,00:18:14,00:18:15,"Oh, yeah, who's that?"
302,00:18:15,00:18:17,My mother. Mm.
303,00:18:17,00:18:18,She's a bit of a clotheshorse.
304,00:18:18,00:18:20,"Still has the figure for it, though."
305,00:18:20,00:18:21,I'll take your word for that.
306,00:18:21,00:18:30,"Well, anyway, uh, hand- stitching on the sleeve, original label, real silk, all beautifully preserved, thanks to dichlorobenzene."
307,00:18:30,00:18:31,You mean mothballs.
308,00:18:31,00:18:32,Exactly.
309,00:18:32,00:18:35,So I doubt that the killer found these on a rack in a thrift store.
310,00:18:35,00:18:39,"No, he probably had 'em in storage, then pulled 'em out and put 'em on our victims."
311,00:18:39,00:18:41,Perhaps these dresses belong to somebody he knows.
312,00:18:41,00:18:44,"Yeah, it's starting to add up now."
313,00:18:44,00:18:49,Maybe it wasn't somebody he knows but someone he was trying to turn these women into.
314,00:18:49,00:18:54,The mayor and I wish to assure the city that we are doing all we can to bring this perpetrator to justice.
315,00:18:54,00:19:09,"As a woman, parent, I understand your fears, and I appeal to anyone who may have been a victim of the Shear Stalker or who may have any information regarding his identity, to please call 911."
316,00:19:09,00:19:12,"Shear Stalker-- wow, they already have a name."
317,00:19:12,00:19:15,You got the sheriff to go public.
318,00:19:15,00:19:17,Very impressive.
319,00:19:17,00:19:19,I appealed to her sense of civic duty.
320,00:19:19,00:19:20,And her fear of voters?
321,00:19:22,00:19:25,There's a lot riding on this.
322,00:19:25,00:19:27,We'll catch him.
323,00:19:28,00:19:32,"Hodges, um, told me about the dresses."
324,00:19:32,00:19:37,"I mean, we may not be getting a picture of our killer, but maybe we have a picture of his obsession."
325,00:19:37,00:19:39,"Blonde, size-six."
326,00:19:39,00:19:42,"If she were in her 20s in the 1970s, she'd be 60-something now."
327,00:19:42,00:19:49,"What do you think this guy's deal is-- fear of women, something deeper, maybe ""Mommy never loved me""?"
328,00:19:49,00:19:54,"Personally, I always tend to go to my Psycho place when killers start playing dress-up."
329,00:19:54,00:20:02,"I always go to my Ted Bundy place-- predator, narcissistic, dissociative identity disorder, woman hater."
330,00:20:02,00:20:03,I'm not so sure.
331,00:20:03,00:20:06,Tox came back on our second victim-- same as the first.
332,00:20:06,00:20:07,C.O.D.-- morphine overdose.
333,00:20:07,00:20:09,"I mean, tha-that's oddly gentle."
334,00:20:09,00:20:11,"He's putting them to sleep, you know?"
335,00:20:11,00:20:15,"Plus, all the care he's taking to, to remake them, to redress them."
336,00:20:15,00:20:17,Where are you going with this?
337,00:20:17,00:20:20,"You know, put it all together, maybe it doesn't spell hate."
338,00:20:20,00:20:21,Maybe it spells love.
339,00:20:21,00:20:23,Love?! Really!
340,00:20:25,00:20:27,"Well, he's still gouging their eyes out."
341,00:20:30,00:20:31,That's true.
342,00:20:34,00:20:37,BRODY: These are the hair extensions Doc Robbins found on our victims.
343,00:20:37,00:20:38,The hair...
344,00:20:38,00:20:40,all came from one person.
345,00:20:40,00:20:42,I compared it to the 26 other hairs we found in the braids.
346,00:20:42,00:20:43,Guess what?
347,00:20:43,00:20:44,No match on any of them.
348,00:20:44,00:20:49,"So, if the braid is a to-do list, then this person is not a target."
349,00:20:49,00:20:51,Henry run DNA?
350,00:20:51,00:20:53,"Yep, hair and dress match."
351,00:20:53,00:20:56,"Okay, killer definitely had access to clothes and hair from the same person."
352,00:20:56,00:21:02,"The person he's making our victims into, and I'm assuming that this mystery woman is not in CODIS."
353,00:21:02,00:21:05,"No, so I ran isotope ratios on the hair."
354,00:21:05,00:21:11,"I can't give you an exact timeline, but it looks like our mystery woman has been doing some traveling-- Japan, Germany, Southern Nevada."
355,00:21:11,00:21:13,She gets around.
356,00:21:13,00:21:14,And not for pleasure.
357,00:21:14,00:21:15,I also ran tox.
358,00:21:15,00:21:21,"Every time she traveled, readings would spike in alkylatic antineoplastic agents and antimetabolites."
359,00:21:21,00:21:27,"Cancer meds. Turns out Hamburg, Tokyo, and Las Vegas all have hospitals that specialize in rare cancers."
360,00:21:27,00:21:29,Which hospital in Vegas?
361,00:21:30,00:21:32,SIDLE: Dr. Bill Ryan?
362,00:21:32,00:21:33,That's right.
363,00:21:33,00:21:35,"Hi. Uh, CSI Sidle."
364,00:21:35,00:21:36,This is CSI Brody.
365,00:21:36,00:21:37,From the crime lab-- we called.
366,00:21:37,00:21:39,How can I help you?
367,00:21:39,00:21:42,We are looking for a patient who is-- was under your care.
368,00:21:42,00:21:45,"SIDLE: We know that the, uh, patient is female."
369,00:21:45,00:21:48,She was treated previously at clinics in Tokyo and Hamburg.
370,00:21:51,00:21:54,You know who we're talking about?
371,00:21:54,00:21:59,"I'm sorry, even if I did, doctor-patient confidentiality would preclude me from confirming it."
372,00:21:59,00:22:00,SIDLE: Of course.
373,00:22:00,00:22:02,Have you watched TV lately?
374,00:22:02,00:22:05,The killer who is cutting people's hair?
375,00:22:05,00:22:09,Does this patient you're looking for have something to do with that?
376,00:22:09,00:22:11,She may be our only way to identify that killer.
377,00:22:11,00:22:15,"SIDLE: Yeah, doctor, um, Do you have a wife?"
378,00:22:15,00:22:16,"Daughters, a sister?"
379,00:22:16,00:22:20,Women all over this town are absolutely terrified right now.
380,00:22:20,00:22:24,"I carry a gun, and you know the first thing I did when I stepped off your elevator?"
381,00:22:24,00:22:26,I checked my hair.
382,00:22:26,00:22:28,I looked behind me to make sure nobody was there.
383,00:22:51,00:22:54,"Look, I'm going to go grab a coffee."
384,00:22:54,00:22:58,"When I get back, I hope that file is still here."
385,00:22:59,00:23:02,"Thank you, Doctor."
386,00:23:07,00:23:09,RUSSELL: Her name's Lucinda Kemp.
387,00:23:09,00:23:11,"Cancer patient, Desert Palm Hospital."
388,00:23:11,00:23:13,She may be our killer's muse.
389,00:23:13,00:23:15,Muse? Muse how?
390,00:23:15,00:23:17,"Well, he's dressing the victims up in her clothes."
391,00:23:17,00:23:19,He's making them up to look like her.
392,00:23:19,00:23:21,A younger version of her.
393,00:23:21,00:23:22,Really?
394,00:23:22,00:23:23,A dying cancer patient?
395,00:23:23,00:23:27,That's some theory you got going on there.
396,00:23:27,00:23:30,"Well, I'm feeling a hell of a lot better about it right now."
397,00:23:32,00:23:34,What do you think?
398,00:23:34,00:23:37,Two dead young women.
399,00:23:40,00:23:42,And your muse is a dead ringer.
400,00:23:47,00:23:49,(thunder rumbling)
401,00:24:08,00:24:10,(doorbell buzzes)
402,00:24:15,00:24:16,(knocking on door)
403,00:24:19,00:24:20,(knocking)
404,00:24:21,00:24:23,RUSSELL: Paula?
405,00:24:23,00:24:25,"Hey, uh, you said I could call you anytime."
406,00:24:25,00:24:26,Is something the matter?
407,00:24:26,00:24:28,I think somebody was inside my house.
408,00:24:28,00:24:31,"The sliding door is open a little, and there's someone banging on my door."
409,00:24:31,00:24:33,"(doorbell buzzes, knocking)"
410,00:24:33,00:24:35,Could you have left it open?
411,00:24:35,00:24:37,No... I don't... Maybe?
412,00:24:37,00:24:39,(knocking continues)
413,00:24:39,00:24:40,There's somebody knocking at my door.
414,00:24:40,00:24:41,"Paula, listen to me."
415,00:24:41,00:24:43,Can you see who it is?
416,00:24:43,00:24:44,Hold on.
417,00:24:49,00:24:51,It's a delivery guy.
418,00:24:51,00:24:52,I'm scared.
419,00:24:52,00:24:54,Do not open the door.
420,00:24:54,00:24:56,Tell him you'll pick up the package later.
421,00:24:56,00:24:59,I'm gonna send a car over to check on you right now.
422,00:24:59,00:25:00,Okay.
423,00:25:00,00:25:02,Everything's gonna be okay.
424,00:25:02,00:25:04,I promise.
425,00:25:04,00:25:05,Thanks.
426,00:25:05,00:25:07,BRASS: I did a welfare check on Paula Bingham.
427,00:25:07,00:25:09,She's okay; really was a delivery guy.
428,00:25:09,00:25:10,"But I can't blame her, though."
429,00:25:10,00:25:12,Everyone's scared.
430,00:25:12,00:25:14,"Sooner we catch this guy, the better."
431,00:25:14,00:25:19,I'm just hoping that Norma Desmond can I.D. her secret admirer.
432,00:25:19,00:25:20,Talk to you later.
433,00:25:20,00:25:23,"Mrs. Kemp, do you recognize these women?"
434,00:25:29,00:25:30,"No, I don't think so."
435,00:25:30,00:25:31,Should I?
436,00:25:31,00:25:32,They were murdered.
437,00:25:32,00:25:36,"After that, the killer gave them a makeover."
438,00:25:36,00:25:40,"Dyed their hair blonde, red lipstick, mascara."
439,00:25:40,00:25:43,That's... horrible.
440,00:25:43,00:25:45,"Truly, but..."
441,00:25:45,00:25:48,why are you showing them to me?
442,00:25:48,00:25:49,"Those are your dresses, right?"
443,00:25:49,00:25:51,"Well, I mean, they certainly look like my dresses."
444,00:25:51,00:25:52,They're my style.
445,00:25:52,00:25:54,My style never goes out of style.
446,00:25:54,00:25:57,I don't understand why you're showing me these.
447,00:25:57,00:25:58,"I don't, either."
448,00:25:58,00:26:01,"On the phone, you said you needed me to answer some questions."
449,00:26:01,00:26:05,"Now, I come down here, and you're treating me like a common criminal."
450,00:26:05,00:26:06,These two women are dead.
451,00:26:06,00:26:10,And the evidence suggests that you're our only link to our killer. Evidence?
452,00:26:10,00:26:11,What evidence?
453,00:26:11,00:26:17,"Well, Adam, the women were staged in dresses that had residual DNA."
454,00:26:17,00:26:22,That DNA matched hair extensions that were attached to the victim's heads.
455,00:26:22,00:26:25,Hair that came from your mother.
456,00:26:25,00:26:26,My hair?
457,00:26:27,00:26:29,"No, that's impossible."
458,00:26:29,00:26:33,"Well, ma'am, in this day and age, everything's possible. Really, Captain."
459,00:26:33,00:26:34,It's not.
460,00:26:37,00:26:39,No one has taken my hair.
461,00:26:39,00:26:43,Because the cancer already took it.
462,00:26:43,00:26:46,"Three months ago, my mother finished her last stage of chemo."
463,00:26:46,00:26:49,You can see the results.
464,00:26:49,00:26:51,I'm... sorry.
465,00:26:51,00:26:52,I'm not.
466,00:26:52,00:26:54,I'm done being sorry.
467,00:26:54,00:26:57,Or... afraid.
468,00:26:57,00:27:00,Or reflective.
469,00:27:00,00:27:02,I am in remission.
470,00:27:02,00:27:04,Thanks to Dr. Ryan.
471,00:27:04,00:27:07,And to Jeffrey's positive attitude.
472,00:27:07,00:27:08,And who is Jeffrey?
473,00:27:08,00:27:10,Jeffrey Fitzgerald.
474,00:27:10,00:27:11,He's a beautiful man.
475,00:27:11,00:27:12,Inside and out.
476,00:27:14,00:27:18,"Mrs. Kemp, is that wig made from your real hair?"
477,00:27:18,00:27:24,"When I started to lose my hair, someone recommended a wig maker."
478,00:27:24,00:27:27,"I did my homework, and I found the best: Jeffrey."
479,00:27:27,00:27:34,"When your insides are eroding, your outside's all you have left."
480,00:27:34,00:27:39,"Your, uh, wig maker, Jeffrey, was he was the one who collected your hair to make the wig?"
481,00:27:39,00:27:41,No. I did.
482,00:27:41,00:27:42,I brought it to his studio.
483,00:27:42,00:27:43,It's out near Silverado Ranch.
484,00:27:43,00:27:44,Along with some of my dresses.
485,00:27:44,00:27:46,As inspiration.
486,00:27:46,00:27:47,Inspiration?
487,00:27:47,00:27:49,Jeffrey is an artist.
488,00:27:49,00:27:54,"He asked me when I felt the most beautiful, so that he could repaint my life."
489,00:27:54,00:27:58,He knows hair like Monet knows light.
490,00:27:58,00:28:00,When was the last time you saw Jeffrey?
491,00:28:00,00:28:02,Just a few days ago.
492,00:28:02,00:28:05,He still comes around to give me a comb-out.
493,00:28:05,00:28:10,He sounds very devoted to you.
494,00:28:12,00:28:14,(thunder rumbling)
495,00:28:15,00:28:17,(sirens wail in distance)
496,00:28:17,00:28:20,Mr. Fitzgerald! LVPD!
497,00:28:29,00:28:31,Mr. Fitzgerald?
498,00:28:31,00:28:33,Police department!
499,00:28:39,00:28:41,(woman screaming)
500,00:28:43,00:28:45,(screaming continues)
501,00:28:50,00:28:52,Let me see your hands!
502,00:28:52,00:28:53,Let me go! Let me go!
503,00:28:53,00:28:55,What did you do to her?
504,00:29:01,00:29:02,Stop looking at my hair.
505,00:29:02,00:29:03,"Sorry, I can't help myself."
506,00:29:03,00:29:05,STOKES: Hey.
507,00:29:05,00:29:06,You're just lucky your client's not pressing charges.
508,00:29:06,00:29:08,Charges?
509,00:29:08,00:29:12,"I was performing a service, which you interrupted. A service?"
510,00:29:12,00:29:13,That's what you're calling it?
511,00:29:13,00:29:15,My client is...
512,00:29:15,00:29:17,how shall we say...
513,00:29:17,00:29:25,"a professional woman who lost a valuable asset, her hair, but doesn't have the assets to afford a proper transplant."
514,00:29:25,00:29:36,"And so, I offered her an affordable, permanent solution: stitching acrylic hair directly into the scalp. And do you have a license to do that?"
515,00:29:36,00:29:38,I'm certified in body modification.
516,00:29:38,00:29:46,"However, my main trade is wig making, for a clientele that needs restorations, not only of the hair, but of their self-esteem."
517,00:29:46,00:29:48,"Yeah, we've seen your work."
518,00:29:48,00:29:49,You're quite the artist. Thank you.
519,00:29:49,00:29:54,"I, uh, I like to think that I give back what God hath taken away."
520,00:29:54,00:29:59,"Well, you hath a very inflated idea of yourself, Mr. Fitzgerald."
521,00:29:59,00:30:03,Image is everything.
522,00:30:07,00:30:09,I knew this guy on days.
523,00:30:09,00:30:11,He had a hair phobia.
524,00:30:11,00:30:15,"Any time there was a crime scene involving hair, he'd puke his guts out."
525,00:30:15,00:30:17,He'd hate this.
526,00:30:17,00:30:18,I got one of those.
527,00:30:18,00:30:19,Really?
528,00:30:19,00:30:21,What's your kryptonite?
529,00:30:21,00:30:24,Braids.
530,00:30:24,00:30:25,"You got a hair thing, too?"
531,00:30:25,00:30:27,No.
532,00:30:27,00:30:28,Braids.
533,00:30:28,00:30:32,Jeffery Fitzgerald had a thing for braids.
534,00:30:36,00:30:38,"And vintage clothing, too."
535,00:30:38,00:30:39,What?
536,00:30:41,00:30:43,That dress look familiar?
537,00:30:44,00:30:45,I do smell mothballs.
538,00:30:47,00:30:48,(shutter clicks)
539,00:30:50,00:30:52,(thunder rumbles)
540,00:30:57,00:30:59,And I...
541,00:30:59,00:31:01,smell a serial killer.
542,00:31:08,00:31:11,(sirens wailing in distance)
543,00:31:11,00:31:14,I smell conviction.
544,00:31:14,00:31:15,"FITZGERALD: So, um..."
545,00:31:15,00:31:19,when are you two crazy kids gonna let me know why I'm here?
546,00:31:20,00:31:22,Lucinda Kemp.
547,00:31:22,00:31:27,"One of the lives you ""restored."" Yeah, yes, I gave her back her hair, restored her beauty."
548,00:31:27,00:31:28,And you're still doing that.
549,00:31:28,00:31:30,You give her a comb-out every week.
550,00:31:30,00:31:33,Is combing out a crime now?
551,00:31:34,00:31:36,(clears throat)
552,00:31:38,00:31:41,You know what I think all this is for him?
553,00:31:41,00:31:42,Foreplay.
554,00:31:42,00:31:46,"Before you have your real fun with these girls, am I right?"
555,00:31:46,00:31:49,Do you recognize that morphine?
556,00:31:49,00:31:52,We found morphine in two dead women.
557,00:31:52,00:31:55,I've never seen it before.
558,00:31:55,00:31:56,Our guys just discovered it in your studio.
559,00:31:58,00:32:09,"Just so I'm clear: You found unmarked morphine, in a place that I rent, after you let yourself in without an invitation."
560,00:32:11,00:32:16,"I'm sorry, I just don't see how that problem relates to me at all."
561,00:32:16,00:32:19,Legally speaking.
562,00:32:19,00:32:22,SIDLE: Fitzgerald can play cute all he likes.
563,00:32:22,00:32:23,We still hit the mother lode.
564,00:32:23,00:32:25,"Lucinda's dress, Lucinda's hair, the morphine."
565,00:32:25,00:32:26,We got him.
566,00:32:26,00:32:28,What about hair braids?
567,00:32:28,00:32:31,"Greg's running them now, along with the rest of the hair from Fitzgerald's studio."
568,00:32:31,00:32:33,You do not want to go into trace lab right now.
569,00:32:33,00:32:36,Where I don't want to go is into court without a DNA match on the hair.
570,00:32:36,00:32:43,"I mean, all the morphine and dresses in the world won't matter at all if we can't connect Fitzgerald directly to the victim."
571,00:32:43,00:32:44,I hear you.
572,00:32:44,00:32:45,"We got this. Okay, okay."
573,00:32:45,00:32:47,(ringtone plays)
574,00:32:47,00:32:49,(phone beeps on)
575,00:32:49,00:32:51,Paula?
576,00:32:51,00:32:52,"(wheezing): Please, help."
577,00:32:52,00:32:55,"I got free, but I can't see."
578,00:32:55,00:32:56,He forgot something downstairs.
579,00:32:56,00:32:58,(door shuts)
580,00:32:58,00:33:00,I think he's coming back!
581,00:33:00,00:33:02,Paula!
582,00:33:07,00:33:09,(sirens wailing) BRASS: LVPD!
583,00:33:31,00:33:32,Russell.
584,00:33:37,00:33:38,(groans)
585,00:33:38,00:33:40,(sighs)
586,00:33:54,00:33:55,You okay?
587,00:33:58,00:34:00,Guy was interrupted.
588,00:34:03,00:34:04,Panicked.
589,00:34:04,00:34:05,Killed her quick.
590,00:34:05,00:34:08,He knew we were coming.
591,00:34:08,00:34:11,There's nothing you could've done.
592,00:34:11,00:34:13,Our best suspect was in custody.
593,00:34:13,00:34:16,"Well, he's not our best anymore, is he?"
594,00:34:16,00:34:19,"Well, I want to know who is."
595,00:34:23,00:34:25,I don't know.
596,00:34:27,00:34:28,But he left a mess.
597,00:34:28,00:34:30,We'll find something.
598,00:34:33,00:34:36,"Hey, Russell, we just got the call-- what's going on?"
599,00:34:36,00:34:39,Process this scene with a fine-toothed comb.
600,00:34:39,00:34:40,Every inch of it.
601,00:34:43,00:34:44,Call me.
602,00:34:44,00:34:47,"Yeah, you got it."
603,00:34:50,00:34:53,(sighs)
604,00:34:53,00:34:54,(camera shutter clicking)
605,00:34:57,00:35:00,Man... I really thought we had this guy.
606,00:35:00,00:35:02,"SANDERS: Well, who says we don't?"
607,00:35:02,00:35:05,Maybe our wigmaker isn't working alone.
608,00:35:05,00:35:07,The hairs say we don't.
609,00:35:07,00:35:11,"All of the wigs, the braids, the-the bales of hair from his studio."
610,00:35:11,00:35:13,None are a match to our victims.
611,00:35:13,00:35:15,"Well, somebody really went after these women."
612,00:35:15,00:35:18,"Yeah, somebody who had to have had a connection to Lucinda Kemp."
613,00:35:25,00:35:27,I got some short brown hairs here.
614,00:35:27,00:35:30,Obviously didn't come from her.
615,00:35:30,00:35:34,From our killer? Could be. We should be able to get a good DNA sample.
616,00:35:34,00:35:36,Hairs have tags that are pulled out at the root.
617,00:35:36,00:35:38,Might've happened during the struggle.
618,00:35:38,00:35:40,Mm-hmm.
619,00:35:40,00:35:41,(camera shutter clicking)
620,00:35:47,00:35:50,Got what looks like a corner of a photo.
621,00:35:51,00:35:54,"Well, where's the rest of it?"
622,00:35:59,00:36:00,Here it is.
623,00:36:02,00:36:07,Killer might have jammed it up here for reference.
624,00:36:08,00:36:10,"Wait a minute, now."
625,00:36:10,00:36:13,"Now, does that look like a young Lucinda Kemp to you?"
626,00:36:13,00:36:15,Sure does.
627,00:36:15,00:36:23,"Well, if Jeffrey Fitzgerald isn't our killer, maybe it's someone who's even closer to Lucinda."
628,00:36:23,00:36:25,You think it's the son? You talked to him.
629,00:36:26,00:36:28,Hm.
630,00:36:28,00:36:31,Looks like we might have a pretty good print here.
631,00:36:31,00:36:32,We'll figure it out.
632,00:36:54,00:36:56,I'm sorry.
633,00:36:58,00:37:04,"Where are we? Henry's running DNA on the hair, and Nick's working on the print-- we should have an answer soon."
634,00:37:06,00:37:10,"When I was in Seattle, we had some guy running around..."
635,00:37:10,00:37:12,killing coeds...
636,00:37:12,00:37:15,and my daughter was...
637,00:37:16,00:37:19,...roughly the same age at that time.
638,00:37:19,00:37:22,Every crime scene was like walking into her dorm room.
639,00:37:22,00:37:23,Did you catch the guy?
640,00:37:23,00:37:25,Yeah.
641,00:37:25,00:37:28,"We're gonna catch this guy, too."
642,00:37:31,00:37:33,Yeah.
643,00:37:41,00:37:45,Can I tell you something crazy?
644,00:37:45,00:37:52,You know how kids are always bumping into something or falling onto something and they got those cuts and scrapes?
645,00:37:52,00:37:56,I've been saving my kids' Band-Aids for years.
646,00:37:57,00:38:00,Keep them in the refrigerator.
647,00:38:00,00:38:01,DNA reference.
648,00:38:01,00:38:03,Yeah.
649,00:38:03,00:38:05,It's not so crazy.
650,00:38:06,00:38:09,I know somebody who used to work here.
651,00:38:09,00:38:11,She used to do the same thing.
652,00:38:29,00:38:31,(low electronic whirring)
653,00:38:38,00:38:39,(beep)
654,00:38:40,00:38:42,(beep)
655,00:38:42,00:38:46,Henry ran DNA on that hair we found in Paula Bingham's bathroom.
656,00:38:46,00:38:48,Yeah? Compared it to Lucinda Kemp.
657,00:38:48,00:38:50,No familial match.
658,00:38:50,00:38:51,It's not Adam.
659,00:38:51,00:38:53,Are you sure about that? Yeah.
660,00:38:53,00:38:55,'Cause I ran it again myself.
661,00:38:55,00:38:57,Her son's not our killer.
662,00:38:57,00:39:00,So we're down to the print.
663,00:39:00,00:39:02,STOKES: Moment of truth.
664,00:39:02,00:39:03,(computer blips)
665,00:39:07,00:39:09,That's our guy?
666,00:39:13,00:39:15,"What, not even a courtesy call this time?"
667,00:39:15,00:39:17,Not this time.
668,00:39:25,00:39:30,Perhaps we should have this conversation in my office. I think we should do it down at the station.
669,00:39:40,00:39:45,"RUSSELL: First we thought this was a picture of Lucinda Kemp, but it's not, is it?"
670,00:39:45,00:39:48,"It's your mother, back when she was..."
671,00:39:48,00:39:51,young and healthy. And beautiful.
672,00:39:51,00:39:53,Before the cancer took it all away.
673,00:39:53,00:39:56,"Hospital records show, uh, your mother died at age 51."
674,00:39:56,00:40:00,"Yeah, but I'm sure she looked a lot older by then-- a lot like Lucinda Kemp."
675,00:40:00,00:40:02,"That's when all this started, isn't it?"
676,00:40:02,00:40:07,"Lucinda came to you for treatment, and it was like your mother was coming back."
677,00:40:09,00:40:11,"Hey, Doc!"
678,00:40:11,00:40:13,We searched your house.
679,00:40:13,00:40:14,We found the hair products.
680,00:40:14,00:40:15,We found the makeup.
681,00:40:15,00:40:18,Same brands Lucinda uses.
682,00:40:18,00:40:20,You washed her hair; you helped her with her makeup.
683,00:40:20,00:40:24,"Must have been great to have Mom back again, right?"
684,00:40:24,00:40:28,Right up until you didn't. Until Jeffrey the wig guy gave her something that her doctor couldn't.
685,00:40:28,00:40:32,I wasn't just her doctor; I was everything to her.
686,00:40:32,00:40:34,Lean back...
687,00:40:41,00:40:43,"Yeah, but then she left you, right?"
688,00:40:43,00:40:45,Just like your mother did?
689,00:40:45,00:40:48,"No, actually, not exactly like your mother did."
690,00:40:48,00:40:51,"Because you didn't put Lucinda out of her misery, the way you did Mom."
691,00:40:51,00:40:52,"Found that in the medical records, too."
692,00:40:52,00:41:00,"""Death by morphine overdose."" Hospital investigation proved inconclusive, but you were interning at the same hospital, right?"
693,00:41:00,00:41:01,Wow.
694,00:41:01,00:41:02,You killed your mother.
695,00:41:02,00:41:04,I ended her pain!
696,00:41:04,00:41:06,Yeah.
697,00:41:06,00:41:10,Just like you did those other women-- Eva...
698,00:41:10,00:41:12,"Joyce, Paula..."
699,00:41:12,00:41:15,All attempts to recreate your mother.
700,00:41:15,00:41:22,"We found the hair that you cut from all those women, with the date and place when it was taken."
701,00:41:22,00:41:24,You are a very meticulous...
702,00:41:24,00:41:25,"man, Dr. Ryan."
703,00:41:25,00:41:27,"You're kind of a mama's boy, actually."
704,00:41:27,00:41:28,Do you think you know me?!
705,00:41:28,00:41:31,You don't know me at all.
706,00:41:37,00:41:39,"You know something? You're right, I don't."
707,00:41:41,00:41:43,I need to step out for a minute.
708,00:41:46,00:41:48,"You're done, Doc."
709,00:42:07,00:42:09,"Hey, Catherine."
710,00:42:09,00:42:10,"I didn't wake you up, did I?"
711,00:42:10,00:42:14,"No, I know, I know, I'm gonna go home in a minute."
712,00:42:14,00:42:17,"I'm just not quite ready yet, you know?"

714,00:42:20,00:42:22,"No, we're fine, we're fine."

718,00:42:38,00:42:43,"I lost one today, Catherine, and, uh..."
719,00:42:43,00:42:52,"you know, I can't stop seeing her-her face, and... can't stop feeling like, you know, there's something I should have done, you know, something more."

721,00:42:54,00:42:55,"I-I will, I will."
722,00:42:55,00:42:57,"It's, um..."

724,00:43:01,00:43:02,Knew you'd understand.
