0	00:00:01	00:00:03	All right, we are in the processing room.
1	00:00:03	00:00:05	This is the center of the slaughterhouse.
2	00:00:05	00:00:10	This is where Walter Simms was finally killed in a shootout with the police.
3	00:00:10	00:00:14	And this is where we are going to try to contact his ghost.
4	00:00:21	00:00:24	I definitely sense a presence in here.
5	00:00:24	00:00:26	A very strong presence.
6	00:00:26	00:00:28	Yeah, my whole body feels strange.
7	00:00:28	00:00:30	Hair on my arm's standing up.
8	00:00:30	00:00:34	I'm gonna roll my EVP recorder, see what we get.
9	00:00:43	00:00:46	Walter Simms, are you here?
10	00:00:47	00:00:48	Come on, Walter.
11	00:00:48	00:00:50	Talk to us.
12	00:00:50	00:00:52	You still lingering?
13	00:00:52	00:00:56	Relishing the seven sadistic murders you committed?
14	00:00:57	00:01:00	I'll tell you what I'm sensing.
15	00:01:00	00:01:02	It's the boys.
16	00:01:02	00:01:04	Their pain.
17	00:01:04	00:01:06	God, do you feel that?
18	00:01:06	00:01:11	I know the terrible things you went through, but it's okay.
19	00:01:11	00:01:13	No one can hurt you now.
20	00:01:18	00:01:22	Guys, uh, I'm gonna go in the room where the boys were held.
21	00:01:22	00:01:24	Maybe it'll be easier to make contact in there.
22	00:01:24	00:01:25	Okay.
23	00:01:28	00:01:30	I'm gonna set up for some EMF measurements. Doug.
24	00:01:31	00:01:33	You want to go check out the hanging room?
25	00:01:34	00:01:37	All right.
26	00:01:43	00:01:48	It's been 20 years, and still, the feeling in this place, it's...
27	00:01:48	00:01:51	it's hard to describe other than to say it feels...
28	00:01:52	00:01:54	...heavy.
29	00:02:05	00:02:08	This is where Walter Simms did his dirty work.
30	00:02:10	00:02:15	I want you to show yourself, Walter.
31	00:02:15	00:02:17	Make yourself known.
32	00:02:19	00:02:21	Maybe this will entice him.
33	00:02:28	00:02:30	Yeah, that's right.
34	00:02:30	00:02:34	Just like the one you used to butcher those boys.
35	00:02:34	00:02:37	Why don't you come and get it?
36	00:02:37	00:02:39	It's right there.
37	00:02:39	00:02:43	Or are you too afraid because I'm not some defenseless little child?
38	00:02:48	00:02:49	The hooks are moving.
39	00:02:50	00:02:53	He's here.
40	00:03:03	00:03:05	Owen! Owen! Owen!
41	00:03:05	00:03:06	It came from this way.
42	00:03:06	00:03:08	Where's Doug? Where is Doug?
43	00:03:15	00:03:17	Are you okay? Owen?
44	00:03:18	00:03:19	What is that?
45	00:03:35	00:03:37	Really cheery place.
46	00:03:37	00:03:39	Yeah, yeah, tell me about it.
47	00:03:39	00:03:42	I spent a lot of time here working on the original case.
48	00:03:42	00:03:44	What do you mean, original case?
49	00:03:44	00:03:50	Oh, uh, 20 years ago, the security guard, Walter Simms-- he lived in a trailer on-site.
50	00:03:50	00:03:57	This guy, Simms, abducted seven boys over a nine-month period, brought them here and killed them.
51	00:03:57	00:04:01	Mmm. And I mean really grisly stuff.
52	00:04:05	00:04:08	So he ended up dying here himself.
53	00:04:08	00:04:11	After escaping his sentencing hearing, he shot it out with the PD.
54	00:04:11	00:04:15	So you're saying that this homicide is related to the original case.
55	00:04:15	00:04:18	Yeah, the victim tonight is rigged up just like the boys were.
56	00:04:24	00:04:28	The hook, the evisceration-- exactly what Simms did 20 years ago.
57	00:04:32	00:04:38	You know, if I didn't know any better, I'd say that old Walter was back from the dead.
58	00:05:22	00:05:25	I remember I was in sixth grade when all this was going on.
59	00:05:25	00:05:27	Walter Simms-- called him The Butcher.
60	00:05:27	00:05:29	Of course, we didn't know it was Simms at the time.
61	00:05:29	00:05:32	We just knew that kids were disappearing.
62	00:05:32	00:05:35	Kids... my age.
63	00:05:35	00:05:39	And even after Simms was killed, his legend lived on.
64	00:05:39	00:05:46	They say that if you say his name three times, he'll come back to life and gut you.
65	00:05:46	00:05:48	Maybe that's what happened to our victim.
66	00:05:48	00:05:49	Let's try it.
67	00:05:49	00:05:50	I'll conjure him up.
68	00:05:50	00:05:51	You slap the cuffs on him.
69	00:05:51	00:05:53	Walter Simms.
70	00:05:53	00:05:55	Walter Simms.
71	00:05:55	00:05:56	Walter...
72	00:05:56	00:06:00	Don't! If you want to do that sort of stuff, you could do it when I'm gone.
73	00:06:00	00:06:01	Let's go.
74	00:06:07	00:06:10	Oh, you can really see why this place spawned so many ghost stories, huh?
75	00:06:10	00:06:13	Oh, yeah. This place creeps me out in all kinds of ways.
76	00:06:13	00:06:14	Slaughterhouse...
77	00:06:14	00:06:16	This is why I stopped eating meat.
78	00:06:16	00:06:17	Yeah, really.
79	00:06:17	00:06:19	So, no murder weapon?
80	00:06:19	00:06:22	No. Smear is from one of the victim's partners.
81	00:06:22	00:06:23	They're the ones that found him.
82	00:06:23	00:06:27	The male slipped and fell in the blood trying to get the victim down.
83	00:06:29	00:06:31	Did our people touch this?
84	00:06:31	00:06:33	No. You think it's been moved?
85	00:06:33	00:06:37	Well, there's blood on the bottom, but it wasn't in the blood pool.
86	00:06:39	00:06:41	There's no memory card.
87	00:06:41	00:06:42	Somebody must have taken it.
88	00:06:44	00:06:46	Hold up your arms.
89	00:06:46	00:06:47	Okay.
90	00:06:47	00:06:50	I mean, man, this is just crazy, you know?
91	00:06:50	00:06:55	I'm gonna need you to give me your clothes at some point, since you fell in the blood.
92	00:06:55	00:06:57	Yeah, sure. I got others in the car.
93	00:06:57	00:07:00	I mean, God, I just can't believe this.
94	00:07:00	00:07:03	I mean, seriously, Carrie, can you?
95	00:07:04	00:07:09	So, uh, how long have you been doing this... ghost hunting?
96	00:07:09	00:07:10	I don't know.
97	00:07:10	00:07:16	I've always been sensitive, you know, to... things from the other side.
98	00:07:16	00:07:19	But working with Doug and Owen-- that's new.
99	00:07:19	00:07:20	A few months, maybe?
100	00:07:20	00:07:24	And you were filming for some TV show or something?
101	00:07:24	00:07:27	No, it's, uh, for the Internet, mostly.
102	00:07:27	00:07:29	A lot of people do this. They upload videos.
103	00:07:29	00:07:30	It's... it's really nothing.
104	00:07:30	00:07:32	Well, it's not nothing anymore.
105	00:07:32	00:07:40	I mean, holy crap, if we have definitive proof of the spirit world crossing over like this-- I mean, are you kidding me?
106	00:07:40	00:07:41	Owen, just stop!
107	00:07:41	00:07:43	Doug's dead.
108	00:07:44	00:07:48	You don't really think your friend was killed by a ghost, do you?
109	00:07:49	00:07:51	You haven't been inside, have you?
110	00:07:51	00:07:58	I've been in a lot of haunted places, and I've never felt anything as strong as what I felt in there.
111	00:07:58	00:08:00	That's why I wear this.
112	00:08:00	00:08:04	It's always protected me.
113	00:08:05	00:08:07	I'm gonna ask you one question.
114	00:08:07	00:08:10	Then I'm gonna give you one chance to answer it.
115	00:08:10	00:08:12	Where's the memory card that was in your friend's camera?
116	00:08:12	00:08:14	I don't know what you mean.
117	00:08:14	00:08:16	He was filming, right, with the camera?
118	00:08:16	00:08:18	So where's the memory card that was in it?
119	00:08:18	00:08:22	I... (scoffs) Okay. I'm gonna have to confiscate all of your shooting equipment.
120	00:08:22	00:08:27	No, wait. Okay, okay, uh, I-I took it, okay, but I-I need it.
121	00:08:27	00:08:30	I mean, what if Doug actually filmed his killer?
122	00:08:30	00:08:33	Yeah. What if?
123	00:08:33	00:08:36	I'm Captain Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.
124	00:08:36	00:08:38	You the property manager?
125	00:08:38	00:08:39	Thomas Pope.
126	00:08:39	00:08:41	My firm is developing the property.
127	00:08:41	00:08:43	So you've been told what happened?
128	00:08:43	00:08:45	Just that somebody was killed.
129	00:08:45	00:08:46	One of the ghost hunters.
130	00:08:46	00:08:48	Oh, so you knew they were here?
131	00:08:48	00:08:50	Yeah, yeah, they had permission.
132	00:08:50	00:08:52	My boss approved it. I handled the paperwork.
133	00:08:52	00:08:54	They signed about a million liability releases.
134	00:08:54	00:08:56	Thank God, right?
135	00:08:56	00:08:58	I guess.
136	00:08:58	00:09:01	Look, I... I didn't mean it to sound like that. I...
137	00:09:01	00:09:04	Can I ask what happened exactly?
138	00:09:04	00:09:05	We don't know yet.
139	00:09:07	00:09:10	You know, I warned my boss that something bad was gonna happen.
140	00:09:10	00:09:12	I knew it.
141	00:09:12	00:09:14	What do you mean, you knew it?
142	00:09:14	00:09:16	I spent some time inside here.
143	00:09:16	00:09:18	There's a feeling.
144	00:09:18	00:09:21	A feeling?
145	00:09:21	00:09:22	So you people take all the time you need.
146	00:09:22	00:09:28	The minute you're done, I'm knocking the whole place down-- the building and all the ghosts inside.
147	00:09:32	00:09:33	Hey, Doc.
148	00:09:33	00:09:35	A little shorthanded, are you, today?
149	00:09:35	00:09:39	Normally, you don't call me in until you're done with all the scary stuff.
150	00:09:39	00:09:43	Normally, but I wanted you to see something on the victim David brought in from the slaughterhouse.
151	00:09:43	00:09:46	Heard the murder was reminiscent of a previous crime.
152	00:09:46	00:09:48	Well, that's why you're here.
153	00:09:48	00:09:51	The killing wasn't just reminiscent.
154	00:09:51	00:09:54	It was an exact duplication of the original crimes.
155	00:09:54	00:09:57	So, killer did his homework, right?
156	00:09:57	00:09:58	I don't see how.
157	00:09:58	00:10:00	The original victims were all juveniles.
158	00:10:00	00:10:03	Their autopsy reports were very closely guarded.
159	00:10:03	00:10:05	They were never made public.
160	00:10:05	00:10:08	And the M.O. unique enough that it couldn't just be by chance?
161	00:10:08	00:10:09	I would say not.
162	00:10:11	00:10:17	The incision the killer made-- it isn't a straight cut like a butcher or a hunter would make when dressing an animal.
163	00:10:17	00:10:22	It waivers to the left, to the right, and then back again.
164	00:10:22	00:10:25	It's almost as if he was carving an S.
165	00:10:25	00:10:27	S for Simms.
166	00:10:34	00:10:40	Seems like every town has a place like this that all the teenagers know about.
167	00:10:40	00:10:42	Yeah, their parents don't.
168	00:10:42	00:10:45	Obviously, it's not impossible to get in here.
169	00:10:45	00:10:48	Which means our ghost hunters may not have been alone last night.
170	00:11:07	00:11:09	Morgan. Come look at this.
171	00:11:15	00:11:18	It's a shrine.
172	00:11:18	00:11:21	To the seven boys who were murdered here.
173	00:11:22	00:11:25	Some of this stuff looks like it's been here forever.
174	00:11:25	00:11:27	Yeah, and some of this stuff looks like it's...
175	00:11:27	00:11:28	pretty new.
176	00:11:28	00:11:31	Someone's been coming here and making offerings to these kids.
177	00:11:31	00:11:33	Or to their ghosts.
178	00:11:37	00:11:39	What?
179	00:11:39	00:11:40	Did you hear something?
180	00:11:40	00:11:42	No.
181	00:11:42	00:11:44	No, it's nothing.
182	00:11:46	00:11:48	Hey.
183	00:11:49	00:11:51	Did you notice...
184	00:11:51	00:11:56	if our female ghost hunter from earlier was missing an earring?
185	00:11:57	00:11:59	No.
186	00:11:59	00:12:00	That's not hers.
187	00:12:00	00:12:03	Makes me wonder whose, then.
188	00:12:03	00:12:05	So, let's say you're the victim.
189	00:12:05	00:12:07	It's dark.
190	00:12:07	00:12:09	Your back is turned. You're filming.
191	00:12:09	00:12:13	I swing this hook hard enough to bury it in your back.
192	00:12:13	00:12:18	Well, that would be more than enough to incapacitate me so you could hoist me up into the air.
193	00:12:18	00:12:20	And then it's just a single slash with the blade.
194	00:12:20	00:12:24	Yeah. So there's no reason it couldn't have been one person working alone.
195	00:12:26	00:12:30	All right, let's Luminol everything, make sure we didn't miss any blood. (phone ringing)
196	00:12:30	00:12:32	It's for you.
197	00:12:32	00:12:33	Do you want it? SFPD.
198	00:12:33	00:12:35	I'll call them back.
199	00:12:44	00:12:45	I'm gonna hit the lights. Okay.
200	00:12:48	00:12:49	Whoa.
201	00:12:49	00:12:51	Oh, my God.
202	00:12:51	00:12:53	There's blood everywhere.
203	00:12:53	00:12:55	Must be animal blood.
204	00:12:55	00:12:57	This is the kill room.
205	00:12:57	00:13:01	Floor must be porous enough that the blood is still present.
206	00:13:01	00:13:04	I'm going to go do the hallway.
207	00:13:12	00:13:14	Finn? Yeah.
208	00:13:14	00:13:17	Come here and look at this.
209	00:13:18	00:13:23	Wow. Everybody's going in and out, tracking the old animal blood without even knowing it.
210	00:13:23	00:13:24	There's the wheel marks from David's gurney.
211	00:13:24	00:13:27	Mm-hmm.
212	00:13:27	00:13:28	And look over there.
213	00:13:28	00:13:30	There's one set of prints going the other way.
214	00:13:35	00:13:37	The hall dead-ends.
215	00:13:37	00:13:39	Where would they be going?
216	00:13:39	00:13:42	Looks like they walk right through the wall.
217	00:13:42	00:13:46	Or right up to it. There's got to be some reason whoever left these came down here.
218	00:13:56	00:13:58	There's something in here.
219	00:14:05	00:14:08	Yes, there is.
220	00:14:08	00:14:11	Hey. I think Hodges caught us a break.
221	00:14:11	00:14:12	Check this out.
222	00:14:12	00:14:14	What am I looking at?
223	00:14:14	00:14:17	You're looking at footage from one of the ghost hunter's cameras.
224	00:14:17	00:14:19	The surviving male, Owen Webber.
225	00:14:21	00:14:25	Now, according to his statement, he was alone in the processing room during the murder.
226	00:14:25	00:14:26	Which it looks like he is, right?
227	00:14:26	00:14:28	Well, keep watching there.
228	00:14:30	00:14:33	You see that? You mean that little glitch in the picture?
229	00:14:33	00:14:35	That's more than just a glitch.
230	00:14:35	00:14:38	His camera shut off for 98 seconds.
231	00:14:38	00:14:40	That might be enough time to commit the murder.
232	00:14:40	00:14:41	That's more than enough time. (knocking)
233	00:14:41	00:14:43	Oh!
234	00:14:43	00:14:45	Look at you. You got yourself a murder weapon.
235	00:14:45	00:14:47	It was stashed just outside the murder room.
236	00:14:47	00:14:50	Killer probably planned to go back and get it later.
237	00:14:50	00:14:53	What makes you say that? Well, because he didn't bother to wipe off his fingerprints.
238	00:14:53	00:14:54	You got prints?
239	00:14:54	00:14:57	Victim's partner. Owen Webber.
240	00:15:05	00:15:07	Well, it's about time.
241	00:15:07	00:15:08	When am I gonna get my gear back?
242	00:15:08	00:15:09	You're not gonna get your gear back.
243	00:15:09	00:15:12	What? Well, your gear is what we now call evidence, Owen.
244	00:15:12	00:15:14	Well, I know that it's evidence.
245	00:15:14	00:15:15	That's why I need it.
246	00:15:15	00:15:19	The online paranormal groups are going nuts over what happened to Doug. I need the proof.
247	00:15:19	00:15:21	I need to show them that it was Simms.
248	00:15:21	00:15:22	Sit down.
249	00:15:22	00:15:26	And let's talk about what you did to Doug.
250	00:15:28	00:15:30	You recognize that, Owen?
251	00:15:30	00:15:31	It's mine.
252	00:15:31	00:15:34	I brought it along to the slaughterhouse.
253	00:15:34	00:15:36	Sounds like premeditation. Uh, no.
254	00:15:36	00:15:39	I-I... I brought it to excite the spirits.
255	00:15:39	00:15:45	We use objects, something emotionally significant to the dead to provoke them.
256	00:15:45	00:15:49	I mean, come on, man, that's Ghost Chasing 101.
257	00:15:49	00:15:50	That's Murder 101.
258	00:15:50	00:15:54	What?! Why else did you turn off the camera right before Doug was killed?
259	00:15:54	00:15:57	I didn't turn off the camera. My battery pack went dead.
260	00:15:57	00:15:59	Don't you check your batteries before you start?
261	00:15:59	00:16:00	Yeah, of course I did.
262	00:16:00	00:16:01	And they were both full.
263	00:16:01	00:16:04	But spirits can siphon the power away.
264	00:16:04	00:16:06	That's how they get the energy to materialize.
265	00:16:06	00:16:10	Come on, Shaggy. My BS meter is redlining with all this ghost science of yours.
266	00:16:10	00:16:11	What BS?
267	00:16:11	00:16:14	The knife provoked Walter Simms.
268	00:16:14	00:16:18	The battery provided the energy he needed.
269	00:16:18	00:16:22	The very fact that Doug is dead is proof positive of what I'm telling you!
270	00:16:26	00:16:28	Owen didn't kill Doug, I'm telling you.
271	00:16:28	00:16:29	Because you believe a...
272	00:16:29	00:16:31	ghost killed Doug?
273	00:16:31	00:16:33	Because I know Owen.
274	00:16:33	00:16:35	He would never.
275	00:16:35	00:16:38	Well, right now, the evidence says otherwise.
276	00:16:39	00:16:42	You went into the slaughterhouse, didn't you?
277	00:16:43	00:16:47	You know now what I was talking about, those little boys...
278	00:16:47	00:16:48	The only thing I felt in there...
279	00:16:48	00:16:50	was cold.
280	00:16:50	00:16:51	If you'll excuse me.
281	00:16:54	00:16:55	Why are you denying your gift?
282	00:16:55	00:16:58	Your grandmother is still with you, you know.
283	00:16:58	00:17:01	Even though you try to push her away, she's still there.
284	00:17:06	00:17:10	What do you know about my grandmother?
285	00:17:10	00:17:13	She had a funny name.
286	00:17:13	00:17:16	(chuckles) Olaf, was it?
287	00:17:16	00:17:18	And she was a psychic.
288	00:17:18	00:17:20	Seems to think you are, too.
289	00:17:20	00:17:23	You share her gift.
290	00:17:24	00:17:27	What do you want from me?
291	00:17:27	00:17:28	Your help.
292	00:17:29	00:17:31	You heard those boys.
293	00:17:31	00:17:34	I know they were trying to say something.
294	00:17:34	00:17:35	I-I just don't know what it is.
295	00:17:38	00:17:41	I'm sorry, but I can't help you.
296	00:17:44	00:17:46	Thanks, but...
297	00:17:46	00:17:47	I don't want that.
298	00:17:49	00:17:51	You need it.
299	00:17:57	00:17:59	What are all these?
300	00:17:59	00:18:02	Tools of the trade for the modern ghost hunter.
301	00:18:02	00:18:07	E.M. pump, motion sensors, thermal imager, EMF detectors.
302	00:18:07	00:18:09	Ghost Meter Pro? Really?
303	00:18:09	00:18:10	Someone actually makes these?
304	00:18:10	00:18:12	That's not a toy.
305	00:18:12	00:18:13	I just spoke with Nick.
306	00:18:13	00:18:15	Apparently the interrogation was less than fruitful.
307	00:18:15	00:18:20	He's hoping that we can find a way to pinpoint the exact location of the suspect during the time of the murder.
308	00:18:20	00:18:22	But both his cameras were off, right?
309	00:18:22	00:18:25	His cameras were off, but his EVP recorder was still on.
310	00:18:25	00:18:26	EVP?
311	00:18:26	00:18:28	Electronic Voice Phenomenon.
312	00:18:28	00:18:32	Ghost voices we might otherwise miss.
313	00:18:32	00:18:35	The point is, even though we don't have picture, we have sound.
314	00:18:35	00:18:38	Ah. And you think you can use the sound to figure out where the suspect was.
315	00:18:38	00:18:40	That is the idea, yes.
316	00:18:40	00:18:42	So, why do you need me?
317	00:18:42	00:18:45	You mean, aside from the fact that I greatly admire your mind and abilities?
318	00:18:48	00:18:53	The job requires going back to the slaughterhouse, and that is something that I don't relish doing alone.
319	00:18:55	00:18:57	Hey, Jules?
320	00:18:57	00:18:58	Do you got a moment?
321	00:18:58	00:18:59	Sure.
322	00:18:59	00:19:01	Want you to introduce you to Scott Tunnicliff.
323	00:19:01	00:19:03	CSI Finlay.
324	00:19:03	00:19:04	Nice to meet you.
325	00:19:04	00:19:07	Scott's kind of an expert on Walter Simms and the slaughterhouse murders.
326	00:19:07	00:19:09	Wrote a book back in the day.
327	00:19:09	00:19:11	Ah. You working on a sequel?
328	00:19:11	00:19:13	No, actually, I brought him in.
329	00:19:13	00:19:16	He had considerable access to the investigation at the time. My uncle was...
330	00:19:16	00:19:20	undersheriff, so admittedly, I got... special treatment.
331	00:19:20	00:19:24	But I brought along all my old raw research material if it'll help.
332	00:19:24	00:19:26	Tell her your theory, Scott.
333	00:19:26	00:19:29	I've always felt, uh, Simms had an accomplice.
334	00:19:29	00:19:32	Uh, someone to help lure the boys into the car.
335	00:19:32	00:19:35	Yeah, look at this. This is a photo of Simms. That's a real boogeyman.
336	00:19:35	00:19:37	Yeah, not really a face that kids would flock to.
337	00:19:37	00:19:41	There were witnesses to three of the abductions. The statements were the same.
338	00:19:41	00:19:44	The boys approached Simms' car, climbed in on their own accord.
339	00:19:44	00:19:47	So, might be Simms had help.
340	00:19:47	00:19:48	Who's this woman?
341	00:19:48	00:19:50	She's in every trial photo.
342	00:19:50	00:19:52	She was a trial groupie.
343	00:19:52	00:19:54	Showed up every day, never took her eyes off Simms.
344	00:19:54	00:19:55	Was obsessed with him.
345	00:19:55	00:19:56	Why?
346	00:19:56	00:19:58	What do you see?
347	00:19:58	00:19:59	Her earring.
348	00:19:59	00:20:02	It looks exactly like the earring Morgan found at the slaughterhouse.
349	00:20:02	00:20:04	If it is, she was there.
350	00:20:05	00:20:07	So, where is she now?
351	00:20:09	00:20:11	How was that?
352	00:20:11	00:20:12	All right, do it again.
353	00:20:12	00:20:16	This time, a little higher like on the recording.
354	00:20:21	00:20:24	All right, I think you nailed it on that last one.
355	00:20:24	00:20:26	Pretty sure we can pinpoint where Owen was now.
356	00:20:26	00:20:28	Yeah.
357	00:20:28	00:20:30	No way he was the killer.
358	00:20:30	00:20:33	He was in this room when the murders happened.
359	00:20:33	00:20:38	Of course, that means that our killer is still on the loose, right? (chuckles)
360	00:20:46	00:20:48	How'd we do?
361	00:20:48	00:20:50	I hope you got what you needed.
362	00:20:50	00:20:52	My throat is killing me.
363	00:20:52	00:20:53	Well, we cleared Owen as the killer.
364	00:20:54	00:20:57	Did you see all this low-end activity running through the center?
365	00:20:57	00:20:59	Yeah, it's some sort of low-frequency wave.
366	00:20:59	00:21:01	Seems to be present everywhere in this place.
367	00:21:01	00:21:02	But we can't hear it because it's...
368	00:21:02	00:21:04	Because it's below the human range of hearing.
369	00:21:04	00:21:06	It's infrasound.
370	00:21:06	00:21:10	Can you, uh, pitch it up? Raise the frequency until we can hear it? Mmm.
371	00:21:14	00:21:21	Yeah. You know, there are studies that actually suggest that infrasound could be the scientific cause of hauntings.
372	00:21:21	00:21:25	The vibrations create sensory phenomena suggestive of a ghost.
373	00:21:25	00:21:27	Fascinating. Yeah. Mm-hmm.
374	00:21:27	00:21:28	You'll have to show me those articles some time.
375	00:21:28	00:21:33	We could test the theory now, by finding the source of the low-frequency waves and eliminating it.
376	00:21:33	00:21:35	Science!
377	00:21:40	00:21:42	Wow. Who's the crazy?
378	00:21:42	00:21:44	Ah, you can tell right away, right?
379	00:21:44	00:21:47	This woman was obsessed with Walter Simms.
380	00:21:47	00:21:50	Mmm. She was at his trial every single day.
381	00:21:50	00:21:52	Yeah, we've dealt with a few women like this.
382	00:21:52	00:21:53	I'll never understand it.
383	00:21:53	00:21:56	So, I think she could be our killer.
384	00:21:56	00:21:58	But there is no record of her name.
385	00:21:58	00:22:03	I did a facial recognition search against our database, and I got nothing.
386	00:22:03	00:22:06	Why not try running one just against Internet images?
387	00:22:06	00:22:08	She didn't hide from the camera before.
388	00:22:08	00:22:09	Why should she be any different now?
389	00:22:10	00:22:12	All right, let's run it.
390	00:22:14	00:22:15	Who knows?
391	00:22:15	00:22:17	You know, maybe she's...
392	00:22:17	00:22:18	turned her life around by now.
393	00:22:20	00:22:22	That one.
394	00:22:22	00:22:24	Monica Downs.
395	00:22:24	00:22:25	Wow, she even has a Friend Agenda page.
396	00:22:29	00:22:31	Hmm.
397	00:22:31	00:22:34	20 years has done nothing to cure the crazy.
398	00:22:34	00:22:39	The basic theory behind infrasound is that, even though we can't hear it, it still has a physiological effect on us.
399	00:22:39	00:22:43	The low frequency waves cause vibrations in different parts of our bodies.
400	00:22:44	00:22:47	Getting stronger.
401	00:22:47	00:22:49	I hear some other noises, as well.
402	00:22:51	00:22:52	Here, this way. Okay.
403	00:22:52	00:22:59	So, as a result, people experience butterflies in the stomach, chills, hairs standing on end...
404	00:22:59	00:23:01	Check, check and check.
405	00:23:01	00:23:05	Not realizing there's a physical cause, people attribute all these sensations to...
406	00:23:06	00:23:08	...a haunting.
407	00:23:14	00:23:17	Feeling's getting stronger here.
408	00:23:17	00:23:18	Definitely oppressive. Yeah.
409	00:23:18	00:23:21	This is it. This is what's generating the infrasound.
410	00:23:23	00:23:25	Let's turn it off.
411	00:23:29	00:23:30	Uh...
412	00:23:30	00:23:32	Uh...
413	00:23:41	00:23:42	That's amazing.
414	00:23:42	00:23:43	The oppressive feeling's gone.
415	00:23:43	00:23:45	The chills, the stomach...
416	00:23:45	00:23:47	It's gone, right? Yeah.
417	00:23:47	00:23:51	All these years, the sensation everyone's had that this place is haunted...
418	00:23:51	00:23:53	It's perfectly benign.
419	00:23:53	00:23:54	There's nothing bad here at all.
420	00:23:54	00:23:57	(woman screams) Aah!
421	00:23:57	00:23:58	No! No! (metal clanging)
422	00:23:58	00:23:59	Okay, what is that?
423	00:24:01	00:24:03	Oh, no, nothing bad can happen here.
424	00:24:03	00:24:04	There's no haunting.
425	00:24:04	00:24:05	It's just sound waves! Shh.
426	00:24:05	00:24:06	This way.
427	00:24:06	00:24:08	We got blood.
428	00:24:12	00:24:14	Oh, God, it's one of the ghost hunters.
429	00:24:14	00:24:16	Your infrasound can't explain that.
430	00:24:16	00:24:17	Yeah, it's Hodges.
431	00:24:17	00:24:19	We need help.
432	00:24:34	00:24:36	So...
433	00:24:36	00:24:40	it looks like she was sitting there, in front of the shrine.
434	00:24:40	00:24:43	Killer surprised her, maybe.
435	00:24:43	00:24:46	Hit her as she turned around.
436	00:24:46	00:24:48	The bat was here already.
437	00:24:48	00:24:49	You remember?
438	00:24:49	00:24:51	It was part of the toy collection.
439	00:24:51	00:24:54	What I can't figure out is why she came back here in the first place.
440	00:24:54	00:24:56	She came because of the boys.
441	00:24:57	00:25:01	She told me she was still hearing their voices.
442	00:25:01	00:25:02	She wanted...
443	00:25:02	00:25:04	to talk to them.
444	00:25:04	00:25:07	Well, she's talking to them now.
445	00:25:07	00:25:11	We need to find out who else has been coming here, bringing all these toys.
446	00:25:11	00:25:14	Better bag them up and get them to Henry.
447	00:25:24	00:25:25	What? What is it?
448	00:25:27	00:25:29	Her EVP Recorder.
449	00:25:29	00:25:31	Must have fallen when she was struck.
450	00:25:35	00:25:39	I'm sorry for all the horrible things that were done to you.
451	00:25:39	00:25:41	What can I do to bring you peace?
452	00:25:41	00:25:44	Please, I know you're here. I can feel you.
453	00:25:44	00:25:46	Don't be afraid. Just reach out.
454	00:25:46	00:25:49	Talk to me. Give me a sign.
455	00:25:52	00:25:55	Funny, kind of looks like you're...
456	00:25:55	00:25:57	waiting to hear an answer.
457	00:26:00	00:26:04	You don't know this about me, but, uh...
458	00:26:04	00:26:08	when I was younger, I used to be...
459	00:26:08	00:26:10	kind of psychic.
460	00:26:11	00:26:12	I know.
461	00:26:12	00:26:15	But my grandmother, she had it.
462	00:26:17	00:26:20	And I guess I inherited it.
463	00:26:22	00:26:25	(chuckles) Why have I never heard about this?
464	00:26:25	00:26:34	When I became a CSI, science or...
465	00:26:34	00:26:36	the other.
466	00:26:36	00:26:37	I chose science.
467	00:26:37	00:26:41	So, now you've reconsidered?
468	00:26:41	00:26:42	Yeah.
469	00:26:42	00:26:45	I mean, 'cause of Carrie...
470	00:26:45	00:26:47	and what I feel in this place.
471	00:26:47	00:26:53	But I-I thought the feelings came from the infrasound, the vibrations from the ventilation fan.
472	00:26:53	00:26:55	Henry turned it off, and since then, I-I don't feel a thing anymore.
473	00:26:55	00:26:56	That's just it.
474	00:26:56	00:26:59	I still do.
475	00:27:01	00:27:03	I only want to help you.
476	00:27:03	00:27:06	That's all I want, is for you to have peace.
477	00:27:06	00:27:08	Where did you... God, no...
478	00:27:15	00:27:16	Did you hear that? Yeah.
479	00:27:16	00:27:17	Sounded like laughter.
480	00:27:17	00:27:19	Like kids. No, play it again.
481	00:27:26	00:27:27	Ow. Ow.
482	00:27:27	00:27:31	You can't possibly know what I know.
483	00:27:31	00:27:38	Blinded by the confines of corporeal reality, you're both woefully ignorant of what waits on the other side...
484	00:27:38	00:27:39	Got your trial groupie. Ma'am, that's enough.
485	00:27:39	00:27:41	That was quite a ride.
486	00:27:41	00:27:43	For you.
487	00:27:43	00:27:45	Good luck.
488	00:27:45	00:27:46	She's a nutcase.
489	00:27:46	00:27:49	Yeah, a nutcase with blood on her shoes.
490	00:27:49	00:27:54	Your shoes and this shoe print that we found at the murder scene...
491	00:27:54	00:27:55	they match.
492	00:27:55	00:27:56	Match, match, three on a match.
493	00:27:56	00:27:59	And that's bad luck, you know.
494	00:27:59	00:28:00	Want to talk about bad luck?
495	00:28:00	00:28:02	You stepped in a dead woman's blood.
496	00:28:07	00:28:10	I remember you.
497	00:28:10	00:28:11	You do?
498	00:28:11	00:28:13	From Walter's trial.
499	00:28:13	00:28:14	I do.
500	00:28:14	00:28:16	How wonderful.
501	00:28:16	00:28:19	Now, do you remember being at the slaughterhouse earlier?
502	00:28:19	00:28:22	I do.
503	00:28:22	00:28:25	I went to talk to Walter and my boys.
504	00:28:25	00:28:27	Your boys?
505	00:28:27	00:28:28	Yes, that's what I said-- my boys.
506	00:28:28	00:28:31	My family.
507	00:28:31	00:28:36	The family that Walter created for... us.
508	00:28:36	00:28:40	So, when when you talked to Walter, did he tell you to kill Carrie?
509	00:28:43	00:28:45	How about Doug?
510	00:28:47	00:28:48	Huh?
511	00:28:48	00:28:50	I didn't do that.
512	00:28:50	00:28:53	But I... I know who did.
513	00:28:53	00:28:54	You do?
514	00:28:54	00:28:57	He didn't know that I was there watching.
515	00:28:57	00:28:59	Ticktock, like a watch.
516	00:28:59	00:29:02	Tell us who you saw do this.
517	00:29:04	00:29:06	It was one of my boys.
518	00:29:06	00:29:08	Mine and Walter's.
519	00:29:08	00:29:10	Kids, you know?
520	00:29:10	00:29:12	I should probably have a talk with him...
521	00:29:12	00:29:14	if you'd like.
522	00:29:20	00:29:22	Morgan said it was eerie.
523	00:29:22	00:29:23	She wasn't lying.
524	00:29:23	00:29:26	Yeah. That came just after the killing?
525	00:29:26	00:29:27	Yeah.
526	00:29:27	00:29:28	But listen.
527	00:29:30	00:29:33	Now, I'm pretty sure the laughter's real.
528	00:29:33	00:29:34	But it's prerecorded.
529	00:29:34	00:29:36	How do you know that?
530	00:29:36	00:29:39	Watch the screen as I play it, and I'll freeze the wave form.
531	00:29:43	00:29:50	Now, right there, just before the laughter, there's a high-frequency hiss, almost, and then it dies out immediately after.
532	00:29:53	00:29:55	What is it?
533	00:29:55	00:29:58	Well, it's got to be the speaker on whatever device is playing.
534	00:29:58	00:30:03	It powers up just a fraction of a second before the sound comes out.
535	00:30:03	00:30:06	So the killer played a recording of children laughing just after the murder?
536	00:30:08	00:30:10	That might be even sicker.
537	00:31:01	00:31:04	Hey, just finished DNA analysis on the toys.
538	00:31:04	00:31:05	And?
539	00:31:05	00:31:08	I found DNA from a single source on every single one of them.
540	00:31:08	00:31:10	What about the murder weapon?
541	00:31:10	00:31:11	Same DNA, same as the rest of the toys.
542	00:31:11	00:31:14	Let me guess.
543	00:31:14	00:31:16	It belongs to the psycho groupie, Monica Downs.
544	00:31:16	00:31:17	Actually, no.
545	00:31:17	00:31:19	The source was an unknown male.
546	00:31:19	00:31:21	Suggests that Monica Downs is not the killer.
547	00:31:21	00:31:23	It gets stranger.
548	00:31:23	00:31:26	Finlay gave me DNA from the original investigation of the Simms murders.
549	00:31:26	00:31:30	Cops collected one sample from Simms' car that was never identified.
550	00:31:30	00:31:33	Matched the DNA on the toys and the baseball bat.
551	00:31:33	00:31:36	So we're saying the killer was in Simms' car 20 years ago.
552	00:31:36	00:31:38	In the front seat of Simms' car.
553	00:31:38	00:31:41	All the DNA from the boys who were killed came from the back of the car.
554	00:31:41	00:31:45	Well, it sounds to me like we're back to looking for an accomplice.
555	00:31:45	00:31:47	Certainly does.
556	00:31:49	00:31:54	A male, obsessed with the crime, enough knowledge of the details to be able to re-create them perfectly.
557	00:31:56	00:31:57	What do you think?
558	00:32:03	00:32:06	Yeah.
559	00:32:06	00:32:09	(chuckles) Then come back here and rub our faces in it.
560	00:32:18	00:32:20	Well, his alibi checks out.
561	00:32:20	00:32:23	He said he was at a book signing, he was at a book signing.
562	00:32:23	00:32:28	What about the DNA? Sent it to Henry, but I'm afraid it's only gonna confirm that...
563	00:32:28	00:32:29	he's not our guy.
564	00:32:29	00:32:32	Oh, hell.
565	00:32:32	00:32:33	Well...
566	00:32:35	00:32:37	I still like our theory.
567	00:32:37	00:32:39	Looking for the old accomplice in the current murders?
568	00:32:39	00:32:41	I mean, we know he's a male.
569	00:32:41	00:32:43	We know he was in Simms's car 20 years ago.
570	00:32:43	00:32:46	What we don't know is where he is now.
571	00:32:46	00:32:48	Exactly.
572	00:32:48	00:32:50	All right, just-just play with me for a second.
573	00:32:50	00:32:54	Monica Downs said that she saw Carrie's killer, right?
574	00:32:54	00:32:55	That it was one of the boys.
575	00:32:55	00:32:56	Monica Downs is crazy.
576	00:32:56	00:32:58	The boys are dead.
577	00:32:58	00:33:00	All right, all right, but what if they're not?
578	00:33:00	00:33:03	Russell, the cops found all seven bodies.
579	00:33:03	00:33:05	What if there was an eighth? (sighs)
580	00:33:05	00:33:11	What-what if... what if Simms abducted an eighth boy and forced him to be his accomplice?
581	00:33:11	00:33:15	Cops finally catch up with Simms and put him in jail, boy runs away.
582	00:33:15	00:33:17	Which means he might still be out there.
583	00:33:23	00:33:25	(clears throat) What are those?
584	00:33:25	00:33:27	Missing persons reports from 20 years ago.
585	00:33:27	00:33:29	When Simms was snatching up kids. Yeah.
586	00:33:29	00:33:33	I found three other boys that disappeared within that timeframe who were never accounted for.
587	00:33:33	00:33:35	Well, only one of them has a photo.
588	00:33:35	00:33:39	Yeah, as far as the other two go-- uh, Brian Oden grew up on the streets.
589	00:33:39	00:33:41	There were quite a few homeless that reported him missing.
590	00:33:41	00:33:43	And Jonathan Harris grew up in foster care.
591	00:33:43	00:33:50	Everybody just thought he ran away, So, any one of these could be Simms' eighth victim, our so-called accomplice.
592	00:33:50	00:33:52	How do we I.D. him and find him?
593	00:33:52	00:33:54	This kid was in Simms' car.
594	00:33:54	00:33:56	Okay, his DNA is in there.
595	00:33:56	00:33:57	He must have left prints.
596	00:33:57	00:33:59	But PD ran the prints 20 years ago.
597	00:33:59	00:34:02	Yeah, but he was a juvenile, so he wasn't in the system.
598	00:34:02	00:34:04	You're right. Got to be over 30 by now.
599	00:34:04	00:34:05	Maybe that's changed.
600	00:34:08	00:34:10	Hey.
601	00:34:12	00:34:13	Where are you going?
602	00:34:13	00:34:17	If anybody's looking for me, just tell them I had to step out a little while.
603	00:34:17	00:34:19	You going to the slaughterhouse?
604	00:34:19	00:34:20	I thought we wrapped all that up.
605	00:34:20	00:34:22	The place is about to get torn down.
606	00:34:22	00:34:26	If I don't do this now, I'll never get the chance.
607	00:34:26	00:34:28	Greg, what do you really expect to find there?
608	00:34:28	00:34:30	I don't know. Maybe nothing.
609	00:34:30	00:34:34	Or maybe I'll be able to reach out to Carrie, and with her help, maybe to the boys.
610	00:34:34	00:34:36	You know how that sounds, right?
611	00:34:36	00:34:38	Yeah. Crazy.
612	00:34:38	00:34:41	But it doesn't matter.
613	00:34:41	00:34:43	I have to do this.
614	00:35:25	00:35:27	Here we go.
615	00:35:27	00:35:31	Got a hit on the set of prints from the glove box in Simms' car.
616	00:35:31	00:35:32	What's the date of birth?
617	00:35:32	00:35:35	June 8, '81.
618	00:35:35	00:35:37	Means he was 11 at the time.
619	00:35:37	00:35:39	Okay, so this has got to be our eighth kid, right?
620	00:35:39	00:35:40	Scroll down.
621	00:35:40	00:35:42	Wait a minute. I saw him.
622	00:35:42	00:35:45	Where? At the slaughterhouse that first morning, talking to Brass.
623	00:35:45	00:35:46	Well, who is he?
624	00:35:46	00:35:48	He manages the property.
625	00:35:48	00:35:52	Thanks again for coming down to let me in.
626	00:35:52	00:35:54	I really appreciate it.
627	00:35:54	00:35:55	No problem.
628	00:36:03	00:36:05	After you.
629	00:36:18	00:36:22	You know, in a couple of days, this whole place will be gone.
630	00:36:22	00:36:25	Bulldozed to the ground.
631	00:36:25	00:36:28	The building, everything inside.
632	00:36:28	00:36:31	What were you hoping to find?
633	00:36:33	00:36:36	I don't really know.
634	00:36:45	00:36:48	Well, but you're here.
635	00:36:49	00:36:51	Right?
636	00:36:51	00:36:53	You must have some idea.
637	00:37:16	00:37:19	You want to talk to them, don't you?
638	00:37:22	00:37:25	Sorry. It's, uh, my kids' ringtone.
639	00:37:25	00:37:28	It's my wife calling.
640	00:37:32	00:37:34	Don't.
641	00:37:36	00:37:38	Just drop it!
642	00:37:40	00:37:42	Haven't enough people died here?
643	00:37:50	00:37:59	Thomas Pope-- family man, wife and kids, good job, an education, but that's only half of who you really are.
644	00:37:59	00:38:00	See, Thomas Pope is an invention.
645	00:38:00	00:38:01	You made it up.
646	00:38:01	00:38:04	He doesn't exist before about 12 years ago.
647	00:38:04	00:38:06	Your real name is Jonathan Harris, isn't it?
648	00:38:06	00:38:16	When you grew up, you were passed from one foster home to another until one day your luck really went bad and you were abducted by Walter Simms.
649	00:38:16	00:38:18	No, you're wrong. You're mistaken.
650	00:38:18	00:38:21	Well, we found your DNA in Walter Simms' car, along with your fingerprints.
651	00:38:21	00:38:24	We're not wrong, Jonathan. We know who you are.
652	00:38:25	00:38:27	I am not Jonathan.
653	00:38:27	00:38:31	I am not that damaged little boy, not anymore.
654	00:38:34	00:38:39	I know you feel responsible for those other boys, the ones who were killed.
655	00:38:39	00:38:43	Isn't that why you still bring them toys?
656	00:38:43	00:38:46	You were 11 years old.
657	00:38:46	00:38:48	You were a little boy yourself.
658	00:38:48	00:38:50	It wasn't your fault.
659	00:38:50	00:38:53	But they won't let me forget.
660	00:38:53	00:38:55	They blame me.
661	00:38:55	00:38:57	They torment me.
662	00:38:57	00:38:59	And I can't make the voices go away.
663	00:38:59	00:39:01	You were there.
664	00:39:01	00:39:02	You had to have felt them.
665	00:39:04	00:39:07	Tell us about the ghost hunters, Doug and Carrie.
666	00:39:10	00:39:12	I didn't want them inside.
667	00:39:12	00:39:15	I tried to tell my boss that it was a bad idea.
668	00:39:15	00:39:17	Why was it a bad idea?
669	00:39:17	00:39:18	Because I knew what would happen.
670	00:39:18	00:39:21	I knew that they would learn my secret.
671	00:39:21	00:39:28	I have worked very hard to get past everything that has happened and build a new life.
672	00:39:28	00:39:38	If they found out, I would lose everything, everything that I have built as Thomas Pope.
673	00:39:38	00:39:40	But I-I mean, how are they gonna find out?
674	00:39:40	00:39:41	Who's gonna tell them?
675	00:39:41	00:39:43	From talking to the boys.
676	00:39:43	00:39:46	The ghosts of the boys?
677	00:39:46	00:39:49	I couldn't let them talk to the boys.
678	00:39:54	00:39:55	Hey.
679	00:39:55	00:39:57	Hey.
680	00:39:57	00:39:58	Do you have a minute?
681	00:39:58	00:39:59	I do.
682	00:40:01	00:40:06	Uh... back before I came to Vegas, I worked up in San Francisco.
683	00:40:06	00:40:09	I helped put away this guy-- true sociopath.
684	00:40:09	00:40:14	He posed as a cop, pull women over at night, sadistically assault them.
685	00:40:14	00:40:16	We found 17 victims.
686	00:40:16	00:40:17	I suspect there were more.
687	00:40:17	00:40:19	You're talking about Lyle Brinks, right?
688	00:40:19	00:40:22	Yeah. I had no idea you were a part of that.
689	00:40:24	00:40:25	He's up for parole.
690	00:40:25	00:40:31	The cop that I worked with-- she's worried that he actually stands a chance of release.
691	00:40:31	00:40:33	Okay. What can I do?
692	00:40:33	00:40:34	I need a few days.
693	00:40:34	00:40:36	I-I... I want to be there.
694	00:40:36	00:40:39	I want to testify, make sure that doesn't happen.
695	00:40:39	00:40:45	I understand. You got it... but, you know, while you're up there, do me a favor.
696	00:40:45	00:40:46	You know, take some time off.
697	00:40:46	00:40:48	It's been a rough couple of months.
698	00:40:48	00:40:50	You deserve it.
699	00:40:53	00:40:55	Okay.
700	00:40:55	00:40:57	Hey.
701	00:40:57	00:40:59	Great job today.
702	00:40:59	00:41:02	That must have been really scary.
703	00:41:02	00:41:07	I'll tell you, when I heard that laughing, I sure as hell wasn't laughing.
704	00:41:09	00:41:15	You know, I... I think I owe you an apology from earlier, implying that you were crazy.
705	00:41:15	00:41:23	You know, as much as this is our universe, surrounded by science every day, I still like to think there's room for a spiritual side.
706	00:41:23	00:41:28	Well, no apology necessary, but it's accepted.
707	00:41:28	00:41:31	Thank you. But who knows? I mean, maybe you're right.
708	00:41:31	00:41:32	Maybe this whole thing is crazy.
709	00:41:32	00:41:34	What? Why you saying that now?
710	00:41:34	00:41:53	Well, when I was at the slaughterhouse with Pope, I was doing everything I could to hear or feel anything from Carrie or the boys, and I mean, there I was with the killer standing right behind me, and none of them bothered to send up a signal, or a-a single ghostly warning sign?
711	00:41:53	00:41:54	Yeah.
712	00:41:54	00:41:56	Yeah, you would think, right?
713	00:41:59	00:42:02	But I think...
714	00:42:02	00:42:05	someone was looking out for you.
715	00:42:05	00:42:08	You made it out of there okay.
716	00:42:10	00:42:12	Let me buy you breakfast.
717	00:42:12	00:42:15	Deal.
718	00:42:15	00:42:17	But I'm driving.
719	00:42:17	00:42:19	Of course you are.
720	00:42:29	00:42:31	Let's go.
