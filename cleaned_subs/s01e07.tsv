10	00:01:13	00:01:14	Hey.
11	00:01:14	00:01:17	Heads up. The press is gonna be all over this one.
12	00:01:17	00:01:20	Did the count change since you called me?
13	00:01:20	00:01:23	mother, father, two teenage boys.
14	00:01:23	00:01:25	The sisters were luckier.
15	00:01:25	00:01:27	Teen girl heard a noise, hid in the closet.
16	00:01:27	00:01:30	Alerted the neighbors after all the shouting was done.
17	00:01:30	00:01:33	Younger sister's over there.
18	00:01:34	00:01:38	They couldn't have killed their father tag team-- soaking wet.
19	00:01:38	00:01:41	What's the matter with your guys?
20	00:01:41	00:01:43	They've been inside.
21	00:02:31	00:02:34	Put your equipment down, son.
22	00:02:39	00:02:41	Put these on.
23	00:02:41	00:02:45	I'm going to do a preliminary walk-through.
24	00:02:45	00:02:48	You're going to take my notes.
25	00:03:03	00:03:04	Don't touch that!
26	00:03:04	00:03:06	I want everything exactly the way it was.
27	00:03:19	00:03:22	The air smells like copper.
28	00:03:22	00:03:24	Lots of blood.
29	00:03:24	00:03:26	Breathe through your mouth.
30	00:03:26	00:03:29	Yes, sir.
31	00:03:52	00:03:58	Male Caucasian approximately 40 years old lying in a pool of blood.
32	00:04:02	00:04:04	No drag marks.
33	00:04:05	00:04:07	Body does not appear to have been moved.
34	00:04:10	00:04:14	Multiple stab wounds to the back and neck.
35	00:04:15	00:04:17	Looks like a single-edged blade.
36	00:04:17	00:04:25	Force to such a degree that the left and right internal jugular veins have been transected.
37	00:04:25	00:04:26	Head faces west.
38	00:04:26	00:04:32	Feet pointing east Approximately two feet from the north wall one foot from the south.
39	00:04:32	00:04:36	C-Could you take your own notes?
40	00:04:36	00:04:38	I think that I'm going to be sick.
41	00:04:38	00:04:39	I've got it.
42	00:04:39	00:04:41	Go get some fresh air.
43	00:04:43	00:04:45	I heard on the scanner. Quadruple.
44	00:04:45	00:04:47	Figured you might need a hand.
45	00:04:47	00:04:49	You don't sleep, do you?
46	00:04:49	00:04:50	Mm.
47	00:04:50	00:04:53	Blood swirl on the wall.
48	00:04:53	00:04:55	Are you thinking cult?
49	00:04:55	00:04:57	Manson?
50	00:04:57	00:04:59	Somebody left a message.
51	00:05:02	00:05:04	I need to see the rest of it.
52	00:05:12	00:05:15	Female Caucasian.
53	00:05:15	00:05:18	Appears to be one stab wound to the throat.
54	00:05:18	00:05:26	Transection of left and right carotid arteries with exsanguinating hemorrhage.
55	00:05:26	00:05:28	No defense marks.
56	00:05:28	00:05:31	She was killed in her sleep.
57	00:05:58	00:06:01	Do you feel this?
58	00:06:02	00:06:05	Her soul's still in the room.
59	00:06:05	00:06:07	There's something else.
60	00:08:01	00:08:03	You want a barf bag?
61	00:08:03	00:08:06	I want the paramedics that were in this house back here immediately.
62	00:08:06	00:08:09	Police escort. Get them on this front lawn now.
63	00:08:09	00:08:12	You'd think I work for you instead the other way around.
64	00:08:12	00:08:13	Call dispatch.
65	00:08:13	00:08:17	You tell my entire graveyard shift that I want them here A.S.A.P.
66	00:08:17	00:08:19	All of them, no exceptions.
67	00:08:19	00:08:21	Sara, those photos-- blown up times ten.
68	00:08:21	00:08:26	Tell the lab that we need every forensics tool available to us here right away.
69	00:08:26	00:08:28	This is the only crime scene in Las Vegas tonight.
70	00:08:28	00:08:29	Yes, sir.
71	00:08:31	00:08:35	The fear in this neighborhood just south of Las Vegas Boulevard is almost palpable.
72	00:08:35	00:08:40	Scott Collins, his wife and two sons were brutally murdered in their beds.
73	00:08:40	00:08:47	Authorities thus far have offered no comment fueling the fears of the neighbors that a killer is on the lose.
74	00:08:47	00:08:50	It's okay.
75	00:08:50	00:08:51	We'll give you clothes.
76	00:08:51	00:08:53	The lab guys just want to see yours.
77	00:08:53	00:08:55	Sergeant, may I?
78	00:08:56	00:08:58	( sobbing ) Tina...
79	00:08:58	00:09:01	I'm very sorry about what happened to you tonight.
80	00:09:01	00:09:05	But everything we take from your house can help us find out what happened to your family.
81	00:09:05	00:09:08	When can I be with my sister?
82	00:09:09	00:09:12	She's so scared.
83	00:09:16	00:09:17	Soon.
84	00:09:17	00:09:19	Detective.
85	00:09:33	00:09:34	Hi.
86	00:09:36	00:09:37	Is your name Brenda?
87	00:09:40	00:09:43	I'm trying to find out who hurt your family.
88	00:09:45	00:09:46	Do you think you could help me?
89	00:09:49	00:09:52	Did anyone come into your room tonight?
90	00:09:52	00:09:54	Through the door?
91	00:09:54	00:09:57	Through the window maybe?
92	00:10:04	00:10:06	Okay.
93	00:10:10	00:10:12	The buffalo.
94	00:10:23	00:10:24	The buffalo?
95	00:10:26	00:10:29	Who's the buffalo?
96	00:10:33	00:10:34	Brenda?
97	00:11:00	00:11:02	do not do any interviews.
98	00:11:02	00:11:05	don't talk to the sheriff either.
99	00:11:05	00:11:07	Media have it right? Four dead?
100	00:11:07	00:11:09	The killer was here not two hours ago.
101	00:11:09	00:11:11	He left part of himself behind.
102	00:11:11	00:11:13	Catherine, I need you inside, mapping and blood samples.
103	00:11:13	00:11:14	You got it.
104	00:11:14	00:11:16	Nick, Warrick-- the perimeter.
105	00:11:16	00:11:19	I want to know how he got here how he got in, how he got out, and how he left.
106	00:11:19	00:11:20	I'll take the back. You got the front?
107	00:11:20	00:11:22	You got it.
108	00:11:33	00:11:35	Hey, O'Riley, Grissom wants to see you.
109	00:11:41	00:11:43	They said you were looking for me.
110	00:11:43	00:11:45	Hey, stop! Evidence!
111	00:11:45	00:11:47	We're going to hug the wall?
112	00:11:48	00:11:49	This is the only room with no blood in it.
113	00:11:49	00:11:51	There's nothing to disturb.
114	00:11:51	00:11:53	You guys will never get it, will you?
115	00:12:10	00:12:12	Knife drawer.
116	00:12:16	00:12:17	One missing.
117	00:12:17	00:12:20	It's the only drawer open.
118	00:12:20	00:12:22	The killer knew where they were going.
119	00:12:22	00:12:26	I think the suspect's been in this house before.
120	00:12:28	00:12:30	And this is the first place they stopped tonight.
121	00:12:32	00:12:35	Good. Linoleum.
122	00:12:36	00:12:37	The best surface.
123	00:12:37	00:12:40	Best surface for what?
124	00:12:53	00:12:56	You guys got some toys...
125	00:12:56	00:12:59	It's not a toy, O'Riley.
126	00:12:59	00:13:01	It's an Electrostatic Dust Print Lifter.
127	00:13:02	00:13:06	Okay...
128	00:13:06	00:13:08	Like a supercharged lint remover.
129	00:13:08	00:13:12	Only it lifts footprints.
130	00:13:12	00:13:14	Possibly our killer's.
131	00:13:25	00:13:27	We did everything by the book, sir.
132	00:13:27	00:13:32	Relax. I just want to know where you walked in the house and who you touched in there.
133	00:13:32	00:13:35	Well, we did use the main entry, and up the stairs.
134	00:13:35	00:13:39	But once we saw the husband, we grabbed the walls.
135	00:13:39	00:13:41	I felt the pulses in each room.
136	00:13:41	00:13:42	Once I found they were dead, we booked.
137	00:13:42	00:13:44	Show me the bottom of your shoe.
138	00:13:55	00:13:57	Now yours.
139	00:14:03	00:14:05	You fellows were both in the kitchen.
140	00:14:05	00:14:08	We didn't see bodies in there so I didn't think twice about walking on the surface.
141	00:14:08	00:14:11	All right. Yours are the only clean prints I found.
142	00:14:11	00:14:12	Thanks.
143	00:14:13	00:14:14	You can go back to work.
144	00:14:17	00:14:18	News bim's waiting for you.
145	00:14:18	00:14:21	Thinks you have an interesting look.
146	00:14:21	00:14:24	Any truth to the rumor that a cult may have committed these crimes?
147	00:14:24	00:14:25	I don't know that.
148	00:14:25	00:14:27	But you wouldn't rule it out?
149	00:14:27	00:14:28	I don't rule anything out.
150	00:14:28	00:14:31	Grissom.
151	00:14:32	00:14:34	Sheriff?
152	00:14:34	00:14:36	The Mayor has already called.
153	00:14:36	00:14:37	So what have you got?
154	00:14:37	00:14:39	Nothing.
155	00:14:39	00:14:43	I'm not asking you to lay out your whole case.
156	00:14:43	00:14:44	Just give me something I can run with.
157	00:14:45	00:14:48	I have got to feed the press and defuse the panic.
158	00:14:48	00:14:51	As soon as I have something, you'll have something.
159	00:14:51	00:14:53	Here's a thought.
160	00:14:53	00:14:56	Why don't you try being more like Ecklie?
161	00:14:56	00:14:59	Maybe we need him and his day shift crew on this case with you.
162	00:15:00	00:15:05	I could speak volumes about Conrad Ecklie but I have a crime scene to process so... you'll have to excuse me.
163	00:15:08	00:15:10	Sheriff, can you tell me what went on inside?
164	00:15:10	00:15:14	Let me assure everyone that the situation is well under control.
165	00:15:17	00:15:18	You want me inside?
166	00:15:18	00:15:21	I need you to transport the little girl to the police department.
167	00:15:21	00:15:22	Brass is waiting for you.
168	00:15:22	00:15:23	You're kidding me?
169	00:15:23	00:15:24	Right?
170	00:15:24	00:15:27	I'm a taxi service on the biggest case of the year?
171	00:15:27	00:15:28	Sara...
172	00:15:28	00:15:32	I need one of us with that little girl.
173	00:17:05	00:17:07	I want to see all of their personal property.
174	00:17:07	00:17:09	Clothes, jewelry, whatever they have on.
175	00:17:09	00:17:12	If there's something under all this blood you'll be the first to know.
176	00:17:20	00:17:22	This kid should be out playing Pop Warner.
177	00:17:31	00:17:35	I got the blood samples on the way to the lab.
178	00:17:35	00:17:36	Good.
179	00:17:36	00:17:38	You buy this cult thing?
180	00:17:38	00:17:42	You mean the blood swirls next to the father's body in the boys' room?
181	00:17:42	00:17:45	I studied pictures of the Manson murders.
182	00:17:46	00:17:49	This isn't butter. It's imitation.
183	00:17:49	00:17:51	What's your take?
184	00:17:51	00:17:55	Whoever did it killed the mother first.
185	00:17:55	00:17:57	In her sleep, quick.
186	00:17:57	00:18:01	Explains why the blood is confined to the bed and the floor under it.
187	00:18:02	00:18:04	Husband woke up.
188	00:18:04	00:18:06	Ran to protect his kids.
189	00:18:06	00:18:09	The killer nicked him here.
190	00:18:10	00:18:13	and then finished him off down the hall.
191	00:18:13	00:18:17	Gave his life for the little girl.
192	00:18:17	00:18:18	There should be more blood.
193	00:18:18	00:18:20	Yeah.
194	00:18:20	00:18:23	It's a hole. We need to fill it.
195	00:18:23	00:18:28	If we start from the inside and fan out whoever's left at the scene...
196	00:18:28	00:18:31	The first suspect.
197	00:18:34	00:18:35	The teen daughter?
198	00:18:35	00:18:37	She'd need help.
199	00:18:37	00:18:41	Maybe a boyfriend?
200	00:18:41	00:18:43	I wonder if they call him Buffalo.
201	00:18:46	00:18:48	Catherine's the one with the kid, not me.
202	00:18:48	00:18:51	And O'Riley was primary on this till it passed over to me, big deal.
203	00:18:51	00:18:53	What about Family Services?
204	00:18:53	00:18:54	Can't they take her?
205	00:18:54	00:18:57	They sent their case worker over to the hospital so meet her there with the kid.
206	00:18:57	00:18:59	I am not good with kids.
207	00:18:59	00:19:05	Look, I'm not asking you to adopt her just take her over to Sunrise for a psych eval, will you?
208	00:19:14	00:19:16	That's very pretty.
209	00:19:19	00:19:22	Or not.
210	00:19:22	00:19:24	Want to go for another ride?
211	00:19:27	00:19:29	I'll take that as a yes.
212	00:19:29	00:19:33	Tina, do you know what time you heard those noises?
213	00:19:33	00:19:39	No, but they sounded like footsteps coming from the kitchen.
214	00:19:39	00:19:41	And that's when you hid in the closet?
215	00:19:41	00:19:43	Yes.
216	00:19:43	00:19:46	Does your family normally keep the doors locked at night?
217	00:19:46	00:19:47	I don't know.
218	00:19:47	00:19:50	My dad checks the house at night.
219	00:19:50	00:19:54	It's always been a safe neighborhood.
220	00:19:55	00:19:57	Tina...
221	00:19:57	00:19:59	Do you...
222	00:19:59	00:20:02	go out with anyone special?
223	00:20:02	00:20:05	I hook up with different guys.
224	00:20:05	00:20:07	No one special.
225	00:20:07	00:20:12	Are any of them... called Buffalo?
226	00:20:13	00:20:16	Buffalo?
227	00:20:17	00:20:20	No.
228	00:20:20	00:20:23	How about this, Tina?
229	00:20:23	00:20:25	You live in a house with six people, right?
230	00:20:25	00:20:30	You must be used to hearing footsteps in the kitchen late at night.
231	00:20:30	00:20:32	Why so scared last night?
232	00:20:32	00:20:35	I know my brothers' footsteps.
233	00:20:35	00:20:37	And my dad's.
234	00:20:38	00:20:41	These were different.
235	00:20:47	00:20:49	How do you know it's fresh?
236	00:20:49	00:20:51	I checked the sprinkler system.
237	00:20:51	00:20:53	It goes off every night at 0200.
238	00:20:53	00:20:55	And paramedics pronounced at 0240.
239	00:20:55	00:21:04	So somebody came out of the house and got on what looks to be a step down from a motorcycle and drove it across the lawn.
240	00:21:04	00:21:06	And I bet he dropped the bidi I found in the back on the way out.
241	00:21:07	00:21:07	Bidi?
242	00:21:07	00:21:09	Hand-rolled cigarettes?
243	00:21:10	00:21:12	Probably a teenager. They're always taking shortcuts.
244	00:21:12	00:21:14	How's that hand?
245	00:21:14	00:21:15	Hmm?
246	00:21:15	00:21:17	I saw you beating up the door a little while ago.
247	00:21:17	00:21:19	You all right?
248	00:21:19	00:21:21	Yeah. It's cool.
249	00:21:21	00:21:23	I'll see you back at the lab.
250	00:21:30	00:21:31	Hey, Brenda.
251	00:21:31	00:21:33	One of you with Family Services?
252	00:21:34	00:21:35	I am. Connie Bellvue.
253	00:21:35	00:21:38	Brenda's fine but I'd like her to have a consult.
254	00:21:38	00:21:39	I've paged the psychiatric resident.
255	00:21:39	00:21:41	He should be here within the hour.
256	00:21:43	00:21:44	Thanks. I'll take it from here.
257	00:21:46	00:21:47	What's the head exam for?
258	00:21:47	00:21:49	I said...
259	00:21:49	00:21:50	we'll take it from here.
260	00:21:50	00:21:55	Look, if there's any forensic evidence found during this exam, I need to be there.
261	00:21:55	00:21:56	It's already going to be tense.
262	00:21:56	00:22:00	Go back to your crime lab.
263	00:22:00	00:22:01	I'll keep you posted.
264	00:22:03	00:22:04	It's okay, Brenda.
265	00:22:04	00:22:07	I'm not leaving you.
266	00:23:26	00:23:28	Damn. That you, Warrick?
267	00:23:29	00:23:31	You need to tell somebody when you're cutting the lights.
268	00:23:31	00:23:33	What, are you working for OSHA now?
269	00:23:34	00:23:38	Grissom, you remember those tire treads I found on the front lawn?
270	00:23:38	00:23:42	Well, I ran them through the FBI register and they belong to a '93 Honda scooter.
271	00:23:42	00:23:43	That's good.
272	00:23:43	00:23:44	I DMV'd it.
273	00:23:44	00:23:49	A kid four blocks away from the scene owns the same make.
274	00:23:49	00:23:50	That's very good.
275	00:23:50	00:23:53	I might've just blown open the case and all you give me is a that's very good?
276	00:23:53	00:23:57	If your whole family was murdered wouldn't you run to them to see if they were still alive?
277	00:23:57	00:23:59	Yeah.
278	00:24:02	00:24:05	This is a Lady Macbeth.
279	00:24:05	00:24:06	Lady Macbeth?
280	00:24:06	00:24:08	Out, out, damn spot.
281	00:24:08	00:24:12	There's not a trace of blood on the teen daughter's clothing.
282	00:24:12	00:24:14	Not a spot.
283	00:24:20	00:24:22	Linds?
284	00:24:22	00:24:23	Lindsey?
285	00:24:26	00:24:27	Lindsey...
286	00:24:28	00:24:30	Lindsey, hi, honey!
287	00:24:30	00:24:31	Mommy, hi!
288	00:24:31	00:24:35	Oh, am I glad to see you.
289	00:24:37	00:24:39	Daddy came to ballet tonight.
290	00:24:39	00:24:41	I know. I was just there.
291	00:24:41	00:24:44	Your teacher told me Daddy came to pick you up.
292	00:24:44	00:24:46	Oh, you feel so good.
293	00:24:48	00:24:51	Ed... I'm working this quadruple.
294	00:24:51	00:24:54	Time got away from me.
295	00:24:54	00:24:55	I apologize.
296	00:24:55	00:24:58	I figured that's probably what it was.
297	00:24:58	00:25:01	When they couldn't reach you, they called me.
298	00:25:01	00:25:03	Yeah, thank you, I really, really...
299	00:25:03	00:25:05	Cath, Cath, Cath...
300	00:25:05	00:25:06	She's my kid too, okay?
301	00:25:06	00:25:08	All right? Yeah.
302	00:25:08	00:25:10	Oh...
303	00:25:10	00:25:12	So, the case is bad?
304	00:25:12	00:25:14	I saw it on the news.
305	00:25:16	00:25:19	Hey...
306	00:25:19	00:25:21	are you hungry?
307	00:25:21	00:25:22	I made pancakes.
308	00:25:22	00:25:24	You made pancakes?
309	00:25:25	00:25:26	Mm-hmm.
310	00:25:26	00:25:27	For dinner?
311	00:25:27	00:25:28	Yeah.
312	00:25:34	00:25:36	That would be Grissom.
313	00:25:36	00:25:37	How is your boyfriend?
314	00:25:37	00:25:40	Ed.
315	00:25:41	00:25:42	Yeah.
316	00:25:42	00:25:43	Grissom, it's me.
317	00:25:43	00:25:45	I need you back here right away.
318	00:25:45	00:25:47	The Collins case is busting out.
319	00:25:47	00:25:49	Okay, I'll be right there.
320	00:25:49	00:25:51	Just let me throw on some clean clothes.
321	00:25:51	00:25:53	Please do.
322	00:25:55	00:25:57	Eddie...
323	00:25:58	00:26:02	She's going to ask where you are.
324	00:26:02	00:26:04	She always does.
325	00:26:13	00:26:14	Hey, Ecklie.
326	00:26:14	00:26:16	I just got off the phone with the Sheriff.
327	00:26:16	00:26:17	He wants results, Gil.
328	00:26:17	00:26:18	He should go to a sports book.
329	00:26:18	00:26:19	I hear the Stardust is good.
330	00:26:20	00:26:22	He should go to his first team-- my team.
331	00:26:22	00:26:24	Teams? I didn't know this was a competition.
332	00:26:24	00:26:26	Well, it is, and my crew usually wins.
333	00:26:26	00:26:27	Really?
334	00:26:27	00:26:30	Didn't graveyard beat day shift in softball last summer?
335	00:26:30	00:26:32	You know, you can joke all you want.
336	00:26:32	00:26:33	It's your ass on the line.
337	00:26:33	00:26:35	I think it was 14-3.
338	00:26:35	00:26:40	Like I said, it's all about results and if you don't get them I will.
339	00:26:40	00:26:45	The tire treads from the scooter place you at the scene of the murders.
340	00:26:45	00:26:47	Look, I was in Hoover visiting my father.
341	00:26:47	00:26:50	I don't know about Tina's parents getting killed.
342	00:26:50	00:26:53	Tina's parents? So you know Tina Collins?
343	00:26:53	00:26:54	Yeah, I know her.
344	00:26:54	00:26:55	A lot of guys know her.
345	00:26:55	00:26:56	She's a freak.
346	00:26:56	00:26:58	You mean sexually?
347	00:26:58	00:26:58	Yeah.
348	00:26:58	00:27:01	Where's your scooter now?
349	00:27:01	00:27:03	I told him I don't know.
350	00:27:03	00:27:04	It disappeared?
351	00:27:04	00:27:06	Look, it costs money, right?
352	00:27:06	00:27:10	And my dad's been slacking on support so I bought it with three other guys.
353	00:27:10	00:27:11	We share it.
354	00:27:12	00:27:13	Here's a pen.
355	00:27:14	00:27:15	Start writing.
356	00:27:20	00:27:22	Hey, heard you have a suspect.
357	00:27:22	00:27:25	We got about four just on the tire prints alone.
358	00:27:25	00:27:27	Homicide's grabbing them up.
359	00:27:27	00:27:30	Let's talk about what else we have.
360	00:27:30	00:27:35	Tina Collins' pajama top from the murder scene without a drop of blood on it.
361	00:27:35	00:27:36	Hello.
362	00:27:36	00:27:38	How does she explain that?
363	00:27:38	00:27:39	We're about to go ask her.
364	00:27:39	00:27:43	Nick, what did you find out about that stuff you collected at the back of the house?
365	00:27:43	00:27:44	The bidi?
366	00:27:44	00:27:48	DNA's still processing, but Tina said nobody in the family smoked.
367	00:27:48	00:27:50	So a non-family member was out there.
368	00:27:50	00:27:51	Bidi? Bidi?
369	00:27:51	00:27:54	I thought you found a cigarette and a match behind the house.
370	00:27:54	00:27:56	Well, it's just like a cigarette.
371	00:27:56	00:27:57	Kids smoke them.
372	00:27:57	00:27:58	They think there's less carbon monoxide.
373	00:27:58	00:28:02	What did you find out about the psych exam on the little girl?
374	00:28:02	00:28:05	The shrink says the kid is in a catatonic state from a trauma.
375	00:28:05	00:28:07	I could've told you that.
376	00:28:07	00:28:10	But she did respond to the name Buffalo.
377	00:28:10	00:28:13	Respond how?
378	00:28:13	00:28:14	She freaked out.
379	00:28:19	00:28:22	And... what are you doing about it now?
380	00:28:22	00:28:24	Going back to the girl.
381	00:28:24	00:28:25	I left her in the car.
382	00:28:28	00:28:30	The windows are cracked.
383	00:28:32	00:28:34	Give me a little credit.
384	00:28:34	00:28:36	She's at the hospital.
385	00:28:45	00:28:48	I don't know why I didn't get blood on my pajamas.
386	00:28:48	00:28:49	I just didn't.
387	00:28:49	00:28:54	But your statement says that you bent down and hugged your mother who was bleeding profusely.
388	00:28:54	00:29:00	Then you ran out, tripping over your father's body in the upstairs hallway.
389	00:29:00	00:29:03	But there was no blood on you.
390	00:29:03	00:29:05	I saw my family dead.
391	00:29:05	00:29:07	I was scared.
392	00:29:07	00:29:09	I ran to the neighbors.
393	00:29:12	00:29:14	That is the truth.
394	00:29:18	00:29:20	The evidence is telling a different story.
395	00:29:23	00:29:27	I did the nasty with her, yeah, but I didn't kill her family.
396	00:29:27	00:29:31	Besides my dad grounded me last week.
397	00:29:31	00:29:34	I share the scooter with Oliver but I was camping last night.
398	00:29:34	00:29:36	Ask my mom. She made me go.
399	00:29:36	00:29:38	Church group.
400	00:29:39	00:29:40	We had sex. So what?
401	00:29:40	00:29:42	I want a lawyer.
402	00:29:42	00:29:44	You want a lawyer? Okay, we'll get you a lawyer.
403	00:29:44	00:29:51	Investigator Stokes will stay with you just in case you remember where you left that scooter.
404	00:30:01	00:30:04	There's no smoking in here.
405	00:30:04	00:30:06	Sharon Stone-- Basic Instinct, dude.
406	00:30:06	00:30:08	Yeah, and I'm not your dude.
407	00:30:08	00:30:11	This ain't a movie and Sharon Stone's fine, so...
408	00:30:21	00:30:22	Matches?
409	00:30:30	00:30:32	The kid's name is Jesse Overton.
410	00:30:33	00:30:35	He time-shares the scooter.
411	00:30:35	00:30:38	He admits to having sex with your girl and he's asking for a lawyer.
412	00:30:41	00:30:43	I want to get a warrant and search his house.
413	00:30:44	00:30:46	I'll keep you posted.
414	00:30:48	00:30:51	I want to see my sister.
415	00:30:51	00:30:52	It's not going to happen, Tina.
416	00:30:52	00:30:55	It's a little too late to start coaching her now.
417	00:30:55	00:30:56	You don't understand.
418	00:30:56	00:30:57	I need to speak with her.
419	00:30:57	00:30:58	She won't speak.
420	00:30:58	00:31:00	The doctor says it's from trauma.
421	00:31:01	00:31:03	What happened, Tina?
422	00:31:04	00:31:07	Did you catch your boyfriend killing your family?
423	00:31:18	00:31:21	Ha-ha-ha. Houston, we have lift-off.
424	00:31:21	00:31:23	Let me take a look.
425	00:31:25	00:31:28	You see how each half of the match lines up?
426	00:31:28	00:31:29	I see.
427	00:31:29	00:31:32	Ah... who broke the case?
428	00:31:32	00:31:35	Well, if you believe what you hear in the halls-- Ecklie.
429	00:31:35	00:31:38	Ecklie?
430	00:31:38	00:31:40	Day shift. Day shift.
431	00:31:40	00:31:41	Sophisticated criminal, huh?
432	00:31:43	00:31:45	Hmm?
433	00:31:45	00:31:47	This is the getaway vehicle.
434	00:31:47	00:31:51	Tossing it in his own trash? What else is new?
435	00:31:51	00:31:53	Whoa.
436	00:31:55	00:31:58	Is this a pair of jeans under all that blood?
437	00:31:58	00:32:03	Yet who would have thought the old man to have so much blood in him?
438	00:32:03	00:32:05	What was that?
439	00:32:05	00:32:07	That's Shakespeare.
440	00:32:15	00:32:18	The lawyer's pleading him guilty.
441	00:32:18	00:32:21	Had to, once I put the murder weapon in his mug.
442	00:32:21	00:32:23	Remember-- yes or no.
443	00:32:24	00:32:25	Got it.
444	00:32:25	00:32:28	Did Tina Collins approach you at school and ask you to kill her family?
445	00:32:30	00:32:31	Yes.
446	00:32:32	00:32:36	Would you lie about that to escape the death penalty?
447	00:32:36	00:32:39	No.
448	00:32:39	00:32:41	Did you kill her family?
449	00:32:45	00:32:47	Yes.
450	00:32:47	00:32:50	Did Tina let you in the front door the night of the killings?
451	00:32:50	00:32:53	00. I waited till it was straight up.
452	00:32:58	00:33:00	Yes or no?
453	00:33:01	00:33:03	Sorry.
454	00:33:03	00:33:05	Yes.
455	00:33:05	00:33:08	Did she already have a knife for you?
456	00:33:08	00:33:11	No, she let me choose.
457	00:33:11	00:33:15	Did you use that knife to kill Barbara Collins?
458	00:33:15	00:33:17	Yes.
459	00:33:23	00:33:26	And Mr. Collins?
460	00:33:26	00:33:28	Yes.
461	00:33:32	00:33:35	And both sons?
462	00:33:37	00:33:39	Yes.
463	00:33:39	00:33:45	Was Tina mad at her parents for not letting you see each other?
464	00:33:45	00:33:48	Yes.
465	00:33:48	00:33:53	Did Tina Collins tell you she wanted them dead so you could see each other?
466	00:33:56	00:33:58	Yes.
467	00:34:02	00:34:05	Well, the sick bastard is on the up and up.
468	00:34:05	00:34:06	Except your last question.
469	00:34:06	00:34:07	Why?
470	00:34:08	00:34:10	That they killed the family so they could be together?
471	00:34:10	00:34:14	Operator says his respiratory reactions were inconsistent.
472	00:34:14	00:34:15	He's lying.
473	00:34:15	00:34:18	We got them both.
474	00:34:18	00:34:19	I don't much care why they did it.
475	00:34:19	00:34:20	I'm with you there.
476	00:34:20	00:34:23	I care.
477	00:34:23	00:34:24	I don't like holes.
478	00:34:24	00:34:27	What are they hiding?
479	00:34:37	00:34:39	Did you collect the property from the Collins family?
480	00:34:39	00:34:42	Right after the autopsies; sealed them myself. Why?
481	00:34:42	00:34:45	I told one of your assistants to make sure that I got them.
482	00:34:45	00:34:46	Well, I gave them to Ecklie.
483	00:34:46	00:34:48	He said he'd deliver them to you.
484	00:34:48	00:34:51	He was down here on another case.
485	00:34:57	00:34:59	Ecklie!
486	00:34:59	00:35:02	I want everything right now.
487	00:35:02	00:35:04	I've been going over it.
488	00:35:04	00:35:06	The Collins case is my shift.
489	00:35:06	00:35:07	You are completely off base.
490	00:35:07	00:35:10	What, you're afraid I'll find something that might show you up?
491	00:35:10	00:35:13	Oh, I'm sure if you could you would have by now.
492	00:35:13	00:35:14	Where is it?
493	00:35:17	00:35:19	I don't care that you got some pimply-faced kid to confess.
494	00:35:19	00:35:22	You kept the Sheriff out of the loop.
495	00:35:22	00:35:23	That's a career-killer, Gil.
496	00:35:23	00:35:26	That's what so sad, Conrad.
497	00:35:26	00:35:29	You think of this as a career.
498	00:36:00	00:36:04	The buffalo.
499	00:36:04	00:36:06	Yeah? Sara.
500	00:36:06	00:36:09	When they examined the little Collins girl did they check for sexual abuse?
501	00:36:09	00:36:12	There were no overt signs. Why?
502	00:36:12	00:36:15	Have some ultraviolet photographs taken.
503	00:36:15	00:36:18	This... is a very special camera.
504	00:36:18	00:36:20	It can see deep into your skin.
505	00:36:20	00:36:23	It can see things nobody can see.
506	00:36:23	00:36:27	How about I take a picture of me first, okay?
507	00:36:29	00:36:31	See?
508	00:36:31	00:36:33	It's okay.
509	00:36:50	00:36:51	Are you ready?
510	00:36:53	00:36:54	Okay.
511	00:36:58	00:37:04	Collins family murder, case #00-398.
512	00:37:04	00:37:06	Intruder killed mother.
513	00:37:06	00:37:11	Father went to protect the little girl.
514	00:37:11	00:37:14	Got nicked by knife.
515	00:37:14	00:37:22	Killer subdued him as dad was entering the little girl's room to...
516	00:37:22	00:37:24	...save her.
517	00:38:04	00:38:06	Catherine Willows?
518	00:38:06	00:38:07	Who's asking?
519	00:38:07	00:38:09	Ted Goggle. I'm with Family Services.
520	00:38:09	00:38:12	Were you working the Collins case?
521	00:38:12	00:38:15	You know, your department can't seem to get things straight.
522	00:38:15	00:38:20	If you're looking for the little girl she's already got a case worker.
523	00:38:20	00:38:22	I'm inquiring about your little girl.
524	00:38:22	00:38:25	My Lindsay? Why? What are you talking about?
525	00:38:25	00:38:35	Your husband, Eddie filed a report says you neglected to pick her up after dance class last night that you routinely neglect her for your job.
526	00:38:35	00:38:37	Is this Eddie's idea of a joke?
527	00:38:37	00:38:39	What, are you in one of his bands?
528	00:38:39	00:38:42	I already made a field visit to your house. Here's the form.
529	00:38:42	00:38:52	Lindsay seems okay but there is going to be an investigation as to whether there was parental neglect.
530	00:38:52	00:38:54	You're on notice.
531	00:39:03	00:39:05	Grissom.
532	00:39:05	00:39:09	It's me. Something's off on the map.
533	00:39:09	00:39:11	Off? How?
534	00:39:11	00:39:14	Uh, I'm looking at dad's blood in the hall.
535	00:39:14	00:39:16	I found an interesting drop.
536	00:39:17	00:39:21	The droplet tells me that he wasn't running to the little girl's room.
537	00:39:21	00:39:23	He was coming out of it?
538	00:39:23	00:39:24	Yeah.
539	00:39:24	00:39:28	I filled one of your holes, Grissom.
540	00:39:28	00:39:32	He killed the father, then killed the mother.
541	00:39:32	00:39:37	The dad's blood we found in the hallway must've dripped off the killer's knife.
542	00:39:51	00:39:53	Damn it.
543	00:39:59	00:40:01	Look at all those bruises.
544	00:40:01	00:40:04	Somebody was all over this kid.
545	00:40:04	00:40:11	We have forensic evidence that your father sexually abused your sister.
546	00:40:12	00:40:14	We also know...
547	00:40:14	00:40:19	that he was in her room the night of the murders.
548	00:40:20	00:40:21	How can you tell?
549	00:40:21	00:40:24	Blood drops.
550	00:40:24	00:40:31	They fall a certain way depending on the motion of the victim.
551	00:40:35	00:40:39	Something horrible happened in that house, didn't it, Tina?
552	00:40:43	00:40:45	Long before the night of the murders.
553	00:40:49	00:40:53	That was the last night he was going to touch her.
554	00:40:53	00:40:58	But why your mother and why your brothers?
555	00:40:58	00:41:05	Because they should've protected me.
556	00:41:07	00:41:08	You?
557	00:41:11	00:41:13	My father...
558	00:41:36	00:41:37	I was young.
559	00:41:38	00:41:44	I learned to deal but when he went for my daughter...
560	00:41:49	00:41:52	Brenda is...?
561	00:42:01	00:42:02	And who is...
562	00:42:02	00:42:04	The father?
563	00:42:06	00:42:11	I was 13...
564	00:42:11	00:42:16	and nobody noticed that my clothes were getting bigger.
565	00:42:20	00:42:22	Nice, huh?
566	00:42:28	00:42:32	Brenda may hate me for what I did...
567	00:42:32	00:42:35	but I protected her.
568	00:42:38	00:42:40	I did that much.
569	00:43:05	00:43:07	Night, guys.
570	00:43:07	00:43:09	See you, Cath. Good work.
571	00:43:13	00:43:16	It'll be back to normal in 24 hours.
572	00:43:17	00:43:18	Normal'd be nice.
