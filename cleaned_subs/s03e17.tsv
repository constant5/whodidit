0	00:00:51	00:00:53	Yeah, yeah. No.
1	00:00:53	00:00:54	All right.
2	00:00:54	00:00:57	Yeah, hold on, hold on.
3	00:00:57	00:00:58	Happy hour. Joint was packed.
4	00:00:58	00:01:00	Two fatalities, four critical.
5	00:01:01	00:01:02	How about the driver?
6	00:01:02	00:01:03	Nonresponsive.
7	00:01:03	00:01:05	I've got a GCS of three.
8	00:01:05	00:01:07	I need to intubate.
9	00:01:07	00:01:08	That's Sara's boyfriend.
10	00:01:08	00:01:10	Hey, Sara. Typical Thursday.
11	00:01:12	00:01:13	Hank?
12	00:01:13	00:01:14	Your wrist is broken.
13	00:01:17	00:01:19	Larry, take over, will you?
14	00:01:22	00:01:24	The car's dry.
15	00:01:24	00:01:26	This must've happened right before the rain.
16	00:01:28	00:01:30	I was sitting at the table.
17	00:01:30	00:01:31	Next thing I knew...
18	00:01:31	00:01:32	I got a heartbeat!
19	00:01:32	00:01:34	Excuse me.
20	00:01:41	00:01:43	Some happy hour, huh?
21	00:01:43	00:01:45	I think happy hour's over.
22	00:02:27	00:02:29	Mind if I take over?
23	00:02:31	00:02:32	You okay?
24	00:02:32	00:02:33	Yeah.
25	00:02:33	00:02:36	I didn't think I'd see you tonight.
26	00:02:36	00:02:38	So that's what all this is about.
27	00:02:40	00:02:41	Thanks.
28	00:02:42	00:02:43	Any time.
29	00:02:43	00:02:46	Listen, I got to head over to the hospital, and I'm sure you got to get back to work.
30	00:02:46	00:02:48	Yeah, but...
31	00:02:48	00:02:50	will you call me if you need anything?
32	00:02:50	00:02:52	My cell will be on.
33	00:02:52	00:02:53	Anything.
34	00:03:00	00:03:02	You and Catherine are running the evidence on this.
35	00:03:02	00:03:04	Warrick just got done with Internal Affairs.
36	00:03:04	00:03:05	He's on his way.
37	00:03:05	00:03:07	You need to talk to the restaurant manager, too.
38	00:03:07	00:03:08	Anything else?
39	00:03:08	00:03:09	No.
40	00:03:09	00:03:11	Where are you going?
41	00:03:11	00:03:12	I got gas.
42	00:03:12	00:03:13	Oh.
43	00:03:13	00:03:16	Residential gas leak in Henderson.
44	00:03:19	00:03:20	Are you the restaurant manager?
45	00:03:20	00:03:21	Yes.
46	00:03:21	00:03:22	I'm Sara Sidle, Crime Lab.
47	00:03:22	00:03:23	Oh, hi, Fred Lychock.
48	00:03:23	00:03:24	Ooh, sorry.
49	00:03:24	00:03:28	Um... your supervisor asked for a seating chart.
50	00:03:29	00:03:31	Everything's computerized-- software program.
51	00:03:31	00:03:34	This here'll show you the number of people per table.
52	00:03:34	00:03:35	Where were you during the crash?
53	00:03:36	00:03:38	I was at the register, behind the bar.
54	00:03:38	00:03:39	Did you see anything?
55	00:03:39	00:03:42	A blurry Jaguar speeding through the intersection.
56	00:03:44	00:03:46	I thought the car would slow down, but it kept right on coming.
57	00:03:46	00:03:49	If you ask me, that's the reason why old people don't belong behind the wheel.
58	00:03:49	00:03:50	Yeah, I didn't ask you.
59	00:03:50	00:03:52	Thanks for your time.
60	00:03:55	00:03:57	I'm sorry. I got wrapped up in...
61	00:03:58	00:03:59	Hank.
62	00:03:59	00:04:01	Yeah.
63	00:04:01	00:04:03	An old Jaguar with a GPS unit.
64	00:04:03	00:04:05	That's strange.
65	00:04:05	00:04:08	Yeah, not your granny's Oldsmobile.
66	00:04:08	00:04:10	We're cleared to go in?
67	00:04:10	00:04:11	Yeah.
68	00:04:11	00:04:13	Gas company shut off the valve at the street.
69	00:04:13	00:04:15	Paramedics aired out the scene.
70	00:04:15	00:04:17	Homicide radioed in a D.B.?
71	00:04:17	00:04:18	Vanessa Arnz.
72	00:04:18	00:04:20	She's in the master bedroom.
73	00:04:22	00:04:23	Thanks.
74	00:04:28	00:04:32	The gas company spikes its natural gas with mercaptan-- smells like rotten eggs.
75	00:04:32	00:04:35	I don't smell anything.
76	00:04:35	00:04:37	All's I smell is mothballs and stale tobacco.
77	00:04:37	00:04:39	Science geek.
78	00:04:41	00:04:43	Takes one to know one, I guess.
79	00:04:49	00:04:51	Hello, David.
80	00:04:51	00:04:53	Hey.
81	00:04:53	00:04:56	She's hot pink, like a maraschino.
82	00:04:56	00:04:58	Makes our job easier.
83	00:04:58	00:05:01	Death was not the result of natural gas inhalation.
84	00:05:01	00:05:03	No, but carbon monoxide's still gas.
85	00:05:03	00:05:11	Right, when carbon monoxide displaces oxygen in the blood, victim asphyxiates, turns... pink.
86	00:05:19	00:05:21	Was Mr. Arnz in bed with her?
87	00:05:22	00:05:22	Uh, yeah.
88	00:05:23	00:05:24	Paramedics said they found them both in here.
89	00:05:24	00:05:27	So why is she dead and he's alive?
90	00:05:30	00:05:35	You know, Dave, when I was a CSI-One, I would've tried to answer that, but now I know where before why.
91	00:05:35	00:05:37	First step, find the source of the C.O.
92	00:05:37	00:05:41	I'll grab the Nighthawk, fire it up.
93	00:05:45	00:05:46	Mr. Arnz has been stabilized.
94	00:05:46	00:05:47	They're preparing him for transport.
95	00:05:47	00:05:49	I want to take a look at him.
96	00:05:49	00:05:50	Yeah.
97	00:05:54	00:05:57	I wake up in the middle of the night sometimes, if I get cold.
98	00:05:57	00:05:59	Vanessa steals the covers.
99	00:05:59	00:06:01	Uh, I woke up and my head was spinning.
100	00:06:02	00:06:04	I think I'm coming down with something.
101	00:06:04	00:06:07	Then I look over at her...
102	00:06:10	00:06:11	Vanessa.
103	00:06:13	00:06:15	My wife isn't breathing.
104	00:06:15	00:06:17	Do you remember anything else?
105	00:06:18	00:06:20	No, I don't remember hanging up the phone.
106	00:06:20	00:06:21	I must've passed out.
107	00:06:21	00:06:24	Next thing I know the paramedics are taking me out.
108	00:06:24	00:06:25	We got to roll.
109	00:06:25	00:06:27	Patient will be at Desert Palm.
110	00:06:27	00:06:28	Wait a minute. What about my boy? Peter seems fine.
111	00:06:28	00:06:30	The kid's 18.
112	00:06:30	00:06:31	Signed an AMA.
113	00:06:39	00:06:41	Peter...
114	00:06:41	00:06:42	my name's Gil Grissom.
115	00:06:42	00:06:46	I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
116	00:06:46	00:06:48	You want to ask me questions.
117	00:06:50	00:06:52	I was in my bedroom, asleep.
118	00:06:52	00:06:53	I heard the doorbell.
119	00:06:53	00:06:55	It was the paramedics.
120	00:06:55	00:06:58	A few minutes later, the police showed up.
121	00:07:00	00:07:03	I'm very sorry about what happened to your mother.
122	00:07:04	00:07:05	Why are you sorry?
123	00:07:05	00:07:08	You're not responsible.
124	00:07:08	00:07:10	You didn't know her.
125	00:07:10	00:07:12	You don't know me.
126	00:07:21	00:07:23	How's she doing?
127	00:07:23	00:07:24	Doctors are working on her right now.
128	00:07:24	00:07:27	Doesn't look good.
129	00:07:28	00:07:30	Relative?
130	00:07:30	00:07:33	Driver's been I.D.'d as Diane Lambert.
131	00:07:33	00:07:35	That's her grandson Corey.
132	00:07:37	00:07:39	Hi, Corey?
133	00:07:39	00:07:41	I'm, uh, Sara Sidle.
134	00:07:41	00:07:43	I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
135	00:07:43	00:07:46	Do you mind if I ask you a couple questions?
136	00:07:46	00:07:48	I don't even know why she was in Las Vegas.
137	00:07:48	00:07:49	We live in Laughlin.
138	00:07:49	00:07:50	She hates it here.
139	00:07:51	00:07:54	Corey, um... did your grandmother own a Jaguar?
140	00:07:54	00:07:56	Yeah... ( sniffles )
141	00:07:56	00:07:58	Yeah, she won it in the, uh, quarter slots.
142	00:07:59	00:08:01	First two coins and bingo. Triple stars.
143	00:08:01	00:08:04	She also win the GPS?
144	00:08:04	00:08:05	No.
145	00:08:05	00:08:07	She hadn't been driving it much.
146	00:08:07	00:08:13	Uh, she got lost a couple times and it scared her, so for her birthday last month, I bought her the unit.
147	00:08:14	00:08:15	Can you excuse me for a second?
148	00:08:15	00:08:16	Yeah.
149	00:08:19	00:08:21	Hey.
150	00:08:21	00:08:22	Hey.
151	00:08:22	00:08:24	And the EMT of the year award goes to...
152	00:08:24	00:08:25	Not me.
153	00:08:25	00:08:27	Death toll's now three.
154	00:08:27	00:08:29	Could climb to four.
155	00:08:29	00:08:33	Elaine-- the girl in the wheelchair-- she's one of the lucky ones.
156	00:08:33	00:08:35	You were amazing.
157	00:08:35	00:08:38	Eight years in the rig, first time I've actually been a part of the scene.
158	00:08:38	00:08:41	I can't stop it going through my head.
159	00:08:41	00:08:45	Yeah, you never know when your life's going to change.
160	00:08:45	00:08:48	Listen, I... I got to get out of here.
161	00:08:48	00:08:50	You need a lift?
162	00:08:50	00:08:53	No, I drove.
163	00:08:54	00:08:55	Hank?
164	00:08:57	00:09:00	I'm really glad you're okay.
165	00:09:00	00:09:02	Thanks.
166	00:09:09	00:09:12	Plenty of tire treads, but nothing looks fresh.
167	00:09:12	00:09:14	So you going to tell me how it went?
168	00:09:14	00:09:17	I got called in by Internal Affairs.
169	00:09:17	00:09:18	How do you think it went?
170	00:09:18	00:09:20	Too many questions.
171	00:09:20	00:09:21	Thanks.
172	00:09:21	00:09:22	I wish I could've pleaded the Fifth.
173	00:09:22	00:09:27	Yeah, you don't answer their questions, you're looking at more days off without pay, and that blows.
174	00:09:27	00:09:29	Yeah.
175	00:09:30	00:09:32	It's a red light camera.
176	00:09:32	00:09:35	Did any of the witnesses see the driver run the red light?
177	00:09:35	00:09:37	Nobody mentioned it, but the camera's there.
178	00:09:37	00:09:38	Big Brother knows.
179	00:09:39	00:09:40	I'll put in a call.
180	00:09:42	00:09:43	Black gold.
181	00:09:46	00:09:48	Now, that looks fresh.
182	00:09:51	00:09:55	Hitting the curb could've caused the car to buck.
183	00:10:01	00:10:05	Traffic light, intersection, curb.
184	00:10:05	00:10:08	Well, either the car wasn't working, or the driver wasn't.
185	00:10:17	00:10:20	Looks like the newspaper dispenser used to be here.
186	00:10:28	00:10:29	Catherine.
187	00:10:32	00:10:33	Tire treads.
188	00:10:33	00:10:35	That kills one theory.
189	00:10:35	00:10:37	Car's brakes must've been working.
190	00:10:37	00:10:40	She tried to stop, but it was too late.
191	00:10:43	00:10:44	no air bags in the vehicle.
192	00:10:45	00:10:46	No.
193	00:10:46	00:10:49	Preliminary cause of death, epidural hematoma.
194	00:10:49	00:10:51	Her head impacted the steering wheel.
195	00:10:52	00:10:57	Blood accumulated between the inner table of the skull and the dural membrane.
196	00:10:57	00:11:01	Her injury is consistent with a severed middle meningeal artery.
197	00:11:01	00:11:02	What about pre-impact?
198	00:11:03	00:11:05	At the risk of feeding a stereotype, she was 72.
199	00:11:05	00:11:08	Any indication of stroke, Alzheimer's, heart attack?
200	00:11:08	00:11:12	I considered and dismissed all age-related factors.
201	00:11:12	00:11:15	No arthritis, no significant impairment of her senses.
202	00:11:15	00:11:23	She has had part of her colon removed, probably due to injury or prior medical condition, but Sara, it's irrelevant to your case.
203	00:11:23	00:11:27	I found no physiological explanation for the crash.
204	00:11:27	00:11:31	Well, that's a bummer, 'cause at this point, we got no forensic one, either.
205	00:11:31	00:11:35	Carbon monoxide fills the air when any carbon-based substance is ignited.
206	00:11:37	00:11:38	The kid checks out, so...
207	00:11:38	00:11:40	the point of ignition's probably this room.
208	00:11:40	00:11:48	Now, the two most common causes unvented space heaters and improperly maintained chimneys.
209	00:11:48	00:11:50	I don't see any heaters.
210	00:11:52	00:11:53	My dad's a fireman.
211	00:11:53	00:11:56	Last Christmas, he gave all the kids C.O. detectors.
212	00:11:58	00:12:00	Would've saved this woman's life.
213	00:12:00	00:12:02	25 parts per million.
214	00:12:02	00:12:04	That's the highest reading in the room.
215	00:12:06	00:12:09	This is a natural gas burning fireplace.
216	00:12:09	00:12:11	Burns clean.
217	00:12:11	00:12:13	C.O. fumes should be minimal at best.
218	00:12:20	00:12:22	Foreign substance.
219	00:12:22	00:12:24	Still warm.
220	00:12:28	00:12:31	There was something other than natural gas burning in here.
221	00:12:32	00:12:36	If the gas company hadn't shut off the gas, whatever that is probably burned up.
222	00:12:36	00:12:39	Chimneys are designed to funnel smoke up and out.
223	00:12:39	00:12:48	If this fireplace was the source of the C.O., the fumes should've traveled up the chimney instead of permeating the room.
224	00:12:48	00:12:51	Unless the chimney isn't doing its job.
225	00:12:55	00:12:57	Damper's busted.
226	00:13:06	00:13:10	Foreign fuel source in a compromised chimney...
227	00:13:10	00:13:12	I think we just ruled out accident.
228	00:13:18	00:13:19	Hey, I hear you're working on Hank's case.
229	00:13:19	00:13:22	I believe it's my case.
230	00:13:22	00:13:23	Territorial.
231	00:13:23	00:13:25	You know, guys don't like that.
232	00:13:25	00:13:26	You're crowding me, Greg.
233	00:13:26	00:13:30	Well, I have some information that could bring us even closer.
234	00:13:31	00:13:32	But you first.
235	00:13:32	00:13:34	What are we looking at?
236	00:13:34	00:13:37	I downloaded the memory from the GPS in the Jaguar.
237	00:13:37	00:13:39	She wasn't a local; I wanted to see if she got lost.
238	00:13:39	00:13:41	Well, did she?
239	00:13:41	00:13:44	Diane Lambert lives in Laughlin.
240	00:13:44	00:13:45	Excuse me.
241	00:13:48	00:13:54	She took 95 North to Summerlin Parkway.
242	00:13:54	00:14:03	Then she took Parkway to Rampart, made a left on Main Street and headed straight to Meadows Lane-- 16 North Meadows Lane.
243	00:14:03	00:14:06	That's where she was going, and that's where she ended up.
244	00:14:06	00:14:08	So does that thing tell you why?
245	00:14:08	00:14:10	What do you have, Greg?
246	00:14:10	00:14:12	Well, maybe she had the munchies.
247	00:14:12	00:14:14	Tox screen came back.
248	00:14:14	00:14:18	Mrs. Lambert tested positive for cannabis sativa.
249	00:14:18	00:14:18	Grass?
250	00:14:18	00:14:21	Grass? So '70s, man.
251	00:14:21	00:14:23	Sticky green, the dank.
252	00:14:23	00:14:26	The chronic, the cush, happy stick, wacky-tobaccy...
253	00:14:26	00:14:27	Well, wait, wait, wait.
254	00:14:27	00:14:28	Grandma was high?
255	00:14:28	00:14:29	Yeah.
256	00:14:29	00:14:31	Grandma was high.
257	00:14:32	00:14:33	As a kite.
258	00:14:34	00:14:35	Hey. Return visit, huh?
259	00:14:35	00:14:37	You're here about the tox screen.
260	00:14:37	00:14:40	Yeah. Was Diane Lambert legally impaired?
261	00:14:40	00:14:44	Less than two nanograms of THC, so per NIDA, she wasn't.
262	00:14:44	00:14:50	Oh. But, if she were a long-time user, her reaction time could've been slowed down, right?
263	00:14:50	00:14:52	I know where you're going. Let me stop you.
264	00:14:52	00:15:02	THC has no significant cumulative effect, Why was a woman her age doping up?
265	00:15:02	00:15:05	Okay, why was a woman her age doping up?
266	00:15:05	00:15:09	Tell you what-- check out her optic nerve.
267	00:15:12	00:15:14	Nerve's damaged.
268	00:15:14	00:15:16	She had glaucoma.
269	00:15:16	00:15:17	I thought you said she was in good health.
270	00:15:17	00:15:19	That was before the tox screen came back.
271	00:15:19	00:15:25	You know, it's not standard procedure to check for glaucoma, but the Mary Jane tipped me off.
272	00:15:25	00:15:31	People think it slows the progression of the disease, but it just reduces the pressure in the eye and that reduction's only temporary.
273	00:15:31	00:15:34	Prescription medications do a much better job.
274	00:15:34	00:15:37	Unfortunately, they don't have the same side effects.
275	00:15:37	00:15:39	Her vision could've been impaired by the glaucoma.
276	00:15:39	00:15:41	It didn't affect her driving.
277	00:15:41	00:15:45	Sara, Diana Lambert has nothing more to tell you.
278	00:15:55	00:15:56	Hello.
279	00:15:57	00:15:58	Oh, hey.
280	00:15:59	00:16:11	So, I got photos of the restaurant patrons off the DMV database and input the information per the restaurant seating chart and the police report.
281	00:16:11	00:16:13	Who's Elaine Alcott?
282	00:16:14	00:16:15	Who?
283	00:16:15	00:16:16	Oh, well, she was seated with Hank.
284	00:16:16	00:16:18	I just thought maybe that...
285	00:16:18	00:16:20	Oh.
286	00:16:20	00:16:23	Anyway, um...
287	00:16:23	00:16:29	Apparently, she told PD that she was returning from the ladies' room at the time of the impact.
288	00:16:30	00:16:31	They must be friends.
289	00:16:31	00:16:33	I saw him with her at the hospital.
290	00:16:33	00:16:35	Okay.
291	00:16:35	00:16:39	Um... okay, so, we've got 36 people in the restaurant.
292	00:16:39	00:16:42	12 worked for Sillmont Healthcare, a block away.
293	00:16:42	00:16:48	Another ten were from the brokerage firm across the street, a couple of regulars, a few out-of-towners and...
294	00:16:48	00:16:49	restaurant employees.
295	00:16:49	00:16:54	You know how long it takes to get in touch with anybody at the Transportation Safety Bureau?
296	00:16:54	00:16:55	It's way out of hand.
297	00:16:55	00:16:58	Diane Lambert ran the light.
298	00:17:01	00:17:06	Wow. She sped through that intersection-- 52 miles per hour.
299	00:17:06	00:17:07	That's more than twice the speed limit.
300	00:17:07	00:17:17	Well, the tread marks tell us that her brakes did work, so it must've been something else that malfunctioned, causing her to accelerate.
301	00:17:17	00:17:19	Gas pedal could've gotten stuck, or...
302	00:17:19	00:17:21	throttle plate could've jammed.
303	00:17:21	00:17:22	There's only one way to find out.
304	00:17:22	00:17:24	I'm on it.
305	00:18:06	00:18:08	Hey.
306	00:18:08	00:18:10	You have, uh...
307	00:18:14	00:18:16	Don't worry about it.
308	00:18:16	00:18:18	How's it going? You find anything?
309	00:18:18	00:18:20	No. Car checks out perfectly.
310	00:18:20	00:18:23	Well, I did some more digging down at the TSB.
311	00:18:23	00:18:30	I found out that the red light camera that photo'd our driver catches four times as many violators as any other camera in Vegas.
312	00:18:30	00:18:32	Intersection's dangerous.
313	00:18:32	00:18:34	Could be a death trap.
314	00:18:43	00:18:44	I didn't page you.
315	00:18:44	00:18:48	No, I just figured I'd come by.
316	00:18:48	00:18:50	You're checking up on me again.
317	00:18:50	00:18:54	No, I'm checking up on my evidence.
318	00:18:55	00:18:59	You think if you hover, the FTIR will work faster?
319	00:18:59	00:19:02	Yeah... Hodges, that's what I think.
320	00:19:02	00:19:05	Hey, boss.
321	00:19:07	00:19:07	Nice timing.
322	00:19:14	00:19:16	The foreign substance in the fireplace is carbon.
323	00:19:16	00:19:18	Associated minerals?
324	00:19:18	00:19:22	None. Pure, unadulterated carbon.
325	00:19:22	00:19:24	It may be pure, but it's not solid.
326	00:19:25	00:19:27	Micro-pores.
327	00:19:27	00:19:29	Sample's under the scope.
328	00:19:38	00:19:40	Activated charcoal?
329	00:19:40	00:19:46	Used in filtration systems, kitty litter, some medications...
330	00:19:46	00:19:49	And possibly a murder.
331	00:19:52	00:19:54	The building has mirrored glass on it.
332	00:19:54	00:19:56	Lets in the light, but it keeps out the glare.
333	00:19:56	00:19:58	Sun sets in the west behind us.
334	00:19:58	00:20:00	Glare could be pretty intense in the afternoon.
335	00:20:01	00:20:04	This could explain why this intersection is so dangerous.
336	00:20:04	00:20:06	So you think the sun was a factor in the crash?
337	00:20:06	00:20:11	Well, according to the accident report, 30 yesterday.
338	00:20:11	00:20:16	15, so the sun was still in the sky.
339	00:20:16	00:20:20	Trees and buildings extend at least ten degrees above the western horizon.
340	00:20:20	00:20:21	Yeah.
341	00:20:21	00:20:28	All right, well, there's 24 hours in a day, 360 degrees in the Earth's rotation.
342	00:20:28	00:20:33	360 divided by 24 is... 15?
343	00:20:33	00:20:37	15. Sun moves about 15 degrees an hour.
344	00:20:54	00:21:02	15 yesterday, the sun would've been about what-- 3.75 degrees above the horizon?
345	00:21:02	00:21:03	Wow, you're fast.
346	00:21:03	00:21:04	3.75, huh?
347	00:21:05	00:21:10	Then the sun was behind the trees at the time of the accident, so it was not a factor.
348	00:21:10	00:21:13	Great, and our investigation is still in the dark.
349	00:21:19	00:21:22	I just got a page from James Watson.
350	00:21:22	00:21:24	And I got one from Francis Crick.
351	00:21:24	00:21:26	What's going on, Greg?
352	00:21:26	00:21:29	Well, as you both know, Watson and Crick are the granddaddies of DNA.
353	00:21:29	00:21:32	Without their discoveries, I'd have nothing to do all day.
354	00:21:32	00:21:34	What have you been doing all day?
355	00:21:34	00:21:37	A tox report on your d.b., Ms. Pretty in Pink.
356	00:21:38	00:21:40	She died of carbon monoxide poisoning.
357	00:21:40	00:21:42	Blood saturation level of 46.2%.
358	00:21:42	00:21:44	No surprise there.
359	00:21:44	00:21:47	Nicotine levels are high-- she was a smoker.
360	00:21:47	00:21:50	And she popped a couple of sleeping pills that night.
361	00:21:50	00:21:52	Nothing probative.
362	00:21:52	00:21:59	What if I told you that Mr. Arnz had a carbon monoxide blood saturation level of 37%-- nearly 10% lower than his wife.
363	00:21:59	00:22:00	Mrs. Arnz was a smoker.
364	00:22:00	00:22:04	Typically, a smoker's blood is already 10% saturated with C.O.
365	00:22:04	00:22:07	You mean smokers get a jump start on the poisoning process?
366	00:22:07	00:22:09	Could explain the 10% difference.
367	00:22:09	00:22:12	It could also explain why he lived and she died.
368	00:22:12	00:22:17	Nice theory, but what if I told you that Mr. Arnz had high nicotine levels as well.
369	00:22:17	00:22:18	They were both smokers.
370	00:22:18	00:22:20	That still doesn't explain why one lived and one died.
371	00:22:21	00:22:25	Well, I don't know if this is going to help, but the sleeping pills are zolpidem.
372	00:22:25	00:22:26	Prescription only.
373	00:22:26	00:22:28	I thought I'd save you some time, talked to Lockwood.
374	00:22:28	00:22:31	She didn't have a prescription, but her husband does.
375	00:22:31	00:22:33	Thanks, Greg.
376	00:22:45	00:22:48	Hey, check this out.
377	00:22:48	00:22:52	The red light camera clocked her speed at 52 miles per hour, right?
378	00:22:52	00:22:54	Mm-hmm.
379	00:22:54	00:23:02	The computer software pegged her at 60 by the time she hits the newspaper dispenser.
380	00:23:02	00:23:04	She accelerated into the building.
381	00:23:05	00:23:07	You already reviewed the driver's tox screen.
382	00:23:07	00:23:09	Now you want her basic blood panel.
383	00:23:09	00:23:11	I'm running with a hunch.
384	00:23:11	00:23:12	Let's go.
385	00:23:19	00:23:24	Acetylcholine levels were low, epinephrine was high.
386	00:23:24	00:23:26	Why are you focused on those hormones?
387	00:23:26	00:23:29	Kamikaze pilots, World War II-- their blood work was very unusual.
388	00:23:29	00:23:32	Acetylcholine levels were low, epinephrine was through the roof.
389	00:23:32	00:23:38	Well, you're talking about the sympathetic response to stress-- eyes dilate, uh, heart rate goes up, hormones go haywire.
390	00:23:38	00:23:40	Diane Lambert lived two hours away.
391	00:23:40	00:23:46	If she drove her car into Vegas with the intention of using it as a murder weapon, I imagine she would be pretty stressed out.
392	00:23:46	00:23:49	Kamikaze Granny.
393	00:24:10	00:24:13	Isaac Asimov-- one of my favorite writers.
394	00:24:14	00:24:19	If knowledge can create problems, then it is not through ignorance that we will solve them.
395	00:24:19	00:24:21	Is that what you're doing here?
396	00:24:21	00:24:22	Solving problems?
397	00:24:22	00:24:25	It's my job to figure out what happened to your mother.
398	00:24:25	00:24:30	Scientists derive satisfaction from figuring out the puzzle.
399	00:24:30	00:24:34	It's about the quest... not the grail.
400	00:24:37	00:24:42	Asimov believed that only scientists could understand the universe.
401	00:24:43	00:24:47	It's not so much that I have confidence in scientists being right...
402	00:24:47	00:24:51	But that I have so much confidence in non-scientists being wrong.
403	00:24:53	00:24:54	You a scientist?
404	00:24:54	00:24:56	Yeah.
405	00:24:56	00:24:58	I am.
406	00:24:59	00:25:00	Peter?
407	00:25:00	00:25:03	The boxes won't unload themselves.
408	00:25:10	00:25:13	Peter and I were hoping to get back into the house tonight.
409	00:25:13	00:25:15	Well, not tonight, sir.
410	00:25:15	00:25:17	It's still an active crime scene.
411	00:25:17	00:25:22	Our lab found zolpidem in your wife's system-- 20 milligrams.
412	00:25:22	00:25:25	That's twice the recommended dosage.
413	00:25:25	00:25:27	Do you know anything about that?
414	00:25:27	00:25:31	Well... Vanessa was having trouble sleeping.
415	00:25:31	00:25:33	The, uh, prescription is in your name.
416	00:25:34	00:25:35	Are you accusing me of something?
417	00:25:35	00:25:36	No.
418	00:25:36	00:25:38	We're just telling you what we know.
419	00:25:42	00:25:45	Look, uh... ( sighs )
420	00:25:45	00:25:52	ever since this discount chain opened a branch down the block, I've been working 16-hour days just trying to survive.
421	00:25:52	00:25:56	And I'd go home and Vanessa would come at me.
422	00:25:56	00:25:57	You're always tired.
423	00:25:58	00:25:59	You never talk to me.
424	00:25:59	00:26:00	Y-You need to communicate with me.
425	00:26:01	00:26:02	You know, I have needs.
426	00:26:02	00:26:03	I'm here all day long.
427	00:26:03	00:26:04	You never talk to me.
428	00:26:05	00:26:07	She'd just go on and on and on talking.
429	00:26:07	00:26:12	And when she'd finally let me get to sleep, she'd want what every woman wants.
430	00:26:13	00:26:15	I-I don't mean just sex.
431	00:26:15	00:26:17	She'd want to talk and talk.
432	00:26:17	00:26:22	00 a.m., the alarm is screaming at me, and I got to go back to work.
433	00:26:22	00:26:25	So you drugged your wife to get some shut-eye?
434	00:26:26	00:26:28	Yeah.
435	00:26:28	00:26:31	I put it in her ice cream.
436	00:26:31	00:26:32	I know it was wrong, but...
437	00:26:32	00:26:33	It's also illegal.
438	00:26:33	00:26:35	Yeah.
439	00:26:35	00:26:37	Happened as an accident the first time.
440	00:26:37	00:26:41	See, I got a problem swallowing pills, so I crush them up in the ice cream.
441	00:26:41	00:26:45	One night, she grabbed the wrong bowl and was out like a light.
442	00:26:45	00:26:47	Best night's sleep I'd had in a long time.
443	00:26:50	00:26:52	Well, if you...
444	00:26:52	00:26:54	you got nothing else you want to ask, I got things I got to do.
445	00:26:54	00:26:56	I have one more question.
446	00:26:56	00:26:57	When did you quit smoking?
447	00:26:57	00:27:00	I noticed the, uh, nicotine patch on your arm.
448	00:27:00	00:27:02	Oh, uh, about three weeks.
449	00:27:02	00:27:03	Doctor's orders.
450	00:27:03	00:27:04	I got high blood pressure.
451	00:27:05	00:27:06	I have another question.
452	00:27:06	00:27:09	Did you know the damper on your chimney was busted?
453	00:27:09	00:27:11	Why, did this have something to do with my wife's death?
454	00:27:11	00:27:13	I mean, I asked Peter if he'd...
455	00:27:16	00:27:18	Is this my fault?
456	00:27:19	00:27:24	If the crash was intentional, I'm thinking either the restaurant was the target or someone inside the restaurant.
457	00:27:24	00:27:25	I'll call Brass.
458	00:27:25	00:27:28	If Lambert had a grudge against the place, somebody there should know her.
459	00:27:28	00:27:31	If she was gunning for someone specific, there's a lot of variables.
460	00:27:31	00:27:35	Maybe we should start with the most obvious targets-- the people sitting in the window. Let's run it.
461	00:27:36	00:27:39	Okay... top to bottom.
462	00:27:40	00:27:44	Cameron Black, deceased; from Jersey.
463	00:27:44	00:27:45	First time in Vegas.
464	00:27:46	00:27:47	Unlikely mark.
465	00:27:49	00:27:53	Rachel Krandall, and...
466	00:27:53	00:27:55	Tom Krandall.
467	00:27:56	00:27:57	Both died at the scene.
468	00:27:57	00:27:59	Both worked for Sillmont Healthcare.
469	00:28:00	00:28:02	Hank and...
470	00:28:02	00:28:05	Elaine Alcott.
471	00:28:05	00:28:08	Also works at the insurance company.
472	00:28:08	00:28:11	Three out of five of the people sitting in the window work at Sillmont Healthcare.
473	00:28:12	00:28:14	Maybe I should go talk to her.
474	00:28:14	00:28:15	Yeah.
475	00:28:15	00:28:17	Maybe you should.
476	00:28:17	00:28:19	I'm sorry, I don't recognize her.
477	00:28:19	00:28:22	Well, uh, could she be one of your policy holders?
478	00:28:22	00:28:23	It's possible.
479	00:28:23	00:28:25	I oversee hundreds of members' accounts.
480	00:28:25	00:28:26	I can check my list.
481	00:28:26	00:28:27	That'd be great.
482	00:28:29	00:28:36	I wish I had some more time off, but with Tom Krandall gone and half my department in the hospital...
483	00:28:36	00:28:39	I'm back at the office tomorrow.
484	00:28:39	00:28:41	Let's see...
485	00:28:41	00:28:44	Diane Lambert.
486	00:28:51	00:28:53	My boyfriend.
487	00:28:54	00:28:57	Saved up my miles and took him to Hawaii last year.
488	00:28:57	00:28:59	He's going to take me to Tahiti in a few weeks.
489	00:28:59	00:29:02	I can't wait.
490	00:29:02	00:29:05	Ms. Lambert isn't on my list.
491	00:29:05	00:29:08	But if you want, I can go on the company database.
492	00:29:08	00:29:09	Thank you.
493	00:29:09	00:29:12	Um, I-I have to get back to the lab.
494	00:29:12	00:29:14	Um, maybe you could call me.
495	00:29:15	00:29:17	Okay.
496	00:30:17	00:30:19	You're not supposed to be in here.
497	00:30:19	00:30:22	It's my home.
498	00:30:22	00:30:25	Well, perhaps you didn't see the crime scene tape.
499	00:30:26	00:30:29	Do I look stupid to you?
500	00:30:29	00:30:30	On the contrary.
501	00:30:30	00:30:33	I heard you have an almost perfect 4.0 GPA.
502	00:30:33	00:30:35	With the exception of a B in English.
503	00:30:35	00:30:40	Our detectives do complete background searches on all the principles at a crime scene.
504	00:30:40	00:30:43	I understand you threatened your English teacher.
505	00:30:44	00:30:48	I have to feed my fish.
506	00:30:50	00:30:56	Clown loaches, tetras, angelfish.
507	00:30:59	00:31:01	You might want to check your filter, too.
508	00:31:01	00:31:03	You're out of charcoal.
509	00:31:10	00:31:14	In 1939, Isaac Asimov was an undergraduate studying zoology.
510	00:31:14	00:31:19	As part of a course requirement, the students were asked to find a stray cat, kill it and dissect it.
511	00:31:19	00:31:24	Isaac found his cat, he killed it, and then he promptly dropped out of zoology.
512	00:31:24	00:31:29	50 years later, he wrote that the memory of killing that cat still haunted him.
513	00:31:29	00:31:32	Do you have a question for me?
514	00:31:32	00:31:34	Yeah, I do.
515	00:31:34	00:31:37	Why didn't you fix the chimney damper in your parents' bedroom?
516	00:31:37	00:31:38	Why would I?
517	00:31:39	00:31:40	You told your father you fixed it.
518	00:31:40	00:31:42	So he'd quit bugging me.
519	00:31:43	00:31:50	And if you're accusing me of disobeying a man with only a tenth-grade education, then you're right.
520	00:31:50	00:31:53	We know you took advantage of the broken damper.
521	00:31:53	00:31:58	Placed activated charcoal from your fish tank filter in the back of the fireplace...
522	00:32:02	00:32:07	...then waited for your father to do what he does every night.
523	00:32:07	00:32:09	You killed your mother.
524	00:32:09	00:32:11	You almost killed your father.
525	00:32:11	00:32:13	That's good science fiction.
526	00:32:13	00:32:22	Well, you thought the charcoal would burn up, destroying any evidence of the crime, but your father woke up, called 911.
527	00:32:25	00:32:31	Nick, at what point is the saturation level of carbon monoxide in the bloodstream lethal?
528	00:32:31	00:32:34	Approximately 45, 50%.
529	00:32:34	00:32:35	Mmm.
530	00:32:35	00:32:40	Well, his mother's level was in the range, but his father's level was low.
531	00:32:40	00:32:48	Yeah, but two people exposed to the same level of carbon monoxide for the same period of time, their C.O. saturation levels should be approximate.
532	00:32:48	00:32:51	As long as the variables are consistent-- body mass, health, age.
533	00:32:51	00:32:53	What about smoking?
534	00:32:53	00:32:55	Of course.
535	00:32:55	00:32:59	Three weeks ago, your father quit.
536	00:33:01	00:33:04	Yeah, we didn't know he'd quit, either.
537	00:33:04	00:33:11	The nicotine levels in his system were high but when we went to speak with him, he was wearing a nicotine patch.
538	00:33:11	00:33:19	The patch delivers nicotine to the blood, but since your father quit smoking cigarettes, his C.O. saturation level returned to zero.
539	00:33:22	00:33:24	You made a basic scientific mistake, Peter.
540	00:33:24	00:33:28	You stopped observing the human element because you thought it was inferior.
541	00:33:31	00:33:34	What I don't understand is why.
542	00:33:34	00:33:37	Man, why would you want to kill your parents?
543	00:33:37	00:33:42	Your high school told us you were accepted to Princeton, early action.
544	00:33:42	00:33:45	A few more months, you would've been 2,000 miles away.
545	00:33:45	00:33:50	Whatever your parents did to piss you off wouldn't have mattered.
546	00:33:53	00:33:55	I know why.
547	00:33:57	00:34:00	They weren't going to let you go, were they?
548	00:34:03	00:34:05	They refused to pay for it.
549	00:34:05	00:34:11	I don't qualify for financial aid because my father makes too much money.
550	00:34:11	00:34:18	Not enough money to live well, but enough to destroy my dreams.
551	00:34:24	00:34:30	So with your parents gone, you could sell the business and pay your tuition.
552	00:34:31	00:34:35	You figured out the puzzle.
553	00:34:35	00:34:37	Must be very gratifying.
554	00:34:37	00:34:41	Science isn't about the gratification, Peter.
555	00:34:41	00:34:43	It's about the truth.
556	00:34:46	00:34:48	Hey.
557	00:34:48	00:34:49	Hey.
558	00:34:54	00:34:57	So, how did it go with Elaine Alcott?
559	00:34:57	00:35:00	She didn't have anything to add to the investigation.
560	00:35:01	00:35:02	Hey, how's it going?
561	00:35:02	00:35:07	Here are the phone records from the driver of the vehicle that you asked for.
562	00:35:07	00:35:11	You know, there may be something to that kamikaze grandma theory of yours.
563	00:35:11	00:35:17	Last week, Diane Lambert closed out her bank accounts, paid off her credit cards, and updated her will.
564	00:35:17	00:35:21	Well, that's certainly more evidence to suggest that her actions were intentional.
565	00:35:21	00:35:26	There's only one Vegas phone number on this statement and the prior statement.
566	00:35:26	00:35:28	There's got to be 80 calls here to the same number.
567	00:35:28	00:35:30	Dial the number.
568	00:35:37	00:35:39	Sillmont Healthcare.
569	00:35:39	00:35:41	How can I direct your call?
570	00:35:43	00:35:44	What's your address?
571	00:35:44	00:35:46	16 South Meadows Lane.
572	00:35:47	00:35:50	Thank you.
573	00:35:52	00:35:55	Right. The Checkerbox is at 16 North Meadows.
574	00:35:55	00:35:59	I don't think that's a coincidence.
575	00:35:59	00:36:05	If Sillmont Healthcare was the intended target, how did she end up at the Checkerbox?
576	00:36:05	00:36:07	Well, I'll tell you what happened to me.
577	00:36:07	00:36:10	Last week, I was driving to a crime scene in the car and the GPS said go right.
578	00:36:10	00:36:14	Had I done so, I'd be coughing up fish from the bottom of Lake Mead.
579	00:36:14	00:36:16	Well, GPS is hardly perfect.
580	00:36:17	00:36:19	Maybe north was a directional default.
581	00:36:19	00:36:21	Or maybe she put in the wrong address.
582	00:36:21	00:36:23	Either way...
583	00:36:25	00:36:28	Why was Diane Lambert so angry?
584	00:36:31	00:36:34	Mrs. Lambert was a member of our HMO.
585	00:36:34	00:36:36	I was, uh, going to call you.
586	00:36:36	00:36:41	Well, did she have some kind of problem with her policy?
587	00:36:41	00:36:44	Not to our knowledge.
588	00:36:44	00:36:46	Then you won't mind if we take a look at her file.
589	00:36:46	00:36:49	I'm sorry, member files are confidential.
590	00:36:49	00:36:51	Well, this member's deceased.
591	00:36:51	00:36:54	Not even the doctor-patient privilege extends postmortem.
592	00:37:08	00:37:10	Mrs. Lambert had colon cancer.
593	00:37:10	00:37:13	If you read further, you'll see that it was in remission.
594	00:37:15	00:37:18	No, actually, her most recent CAT scan shows recurrence two months ago.
595	00:37:18	00:37:22	That's about the same time she started calling your office two times a day.
596	00:37:22	00:37:24	Why would she be calling you?
597	00:37:26	00:37:27	You know what?
598	00:37:27	00:37:29	Four people are dead.
599	00:37:29	00:37:30	Don't waste our time.
600	00:37:30	00:37:32	We can take this downtown.
601	00:37:35	00:37:39	Mrs. Lambert's oncologist recommended immediate and aggressive treatment.
602	00:37:39	00:37:40	Did treatment commence?
603	00:37:41	00:37:42	The recommendation was pending.
604	00:37:42	00:37:44	Well, what exactly does that mean?
605	00:37:44	00:37:47	Not yet approved, not yet denied.
606	00:37:49	00:37:55	In other words, Mrs. Lambert's health was in limbo.
607	00:37:55	00:38:01	She wasn't receiving treatment, but she couldn't file an appeal, since you hadn't officially denied her claim.
608	00:38:01	00:38:04	The authorization process takes... it takes time.
609	00:38:07	00:38:09	Time Mrs. Lambert didn't have.
610	00:38:09	00:38:12	We have a procedure, and we follow it.
611	00:38:16	00:38:23	And while you were following your procedure, and postponing a decision, her cancer cells were multiplying.
612	00:38:23	00:38:25	What were you, playing the odds?
613	00:38:25	00:38:28	Were you hoping she would die before you had to spend a dime?
614	00:38:28	00:38:30	We're not liable here.
615	00:38:30	00:38:35	We're not responsible for Mrs. Lambert's actions.
616	00:38:39	00:38:42	For what it's worth, that makes me sick.
617	00:38:50	00:38:52	Catherine.
618	00:38:52	00:38:53	Yeah.
619	00:38:53	00:38:54	We missed something.
620	00:38:54	00:39:03	Corey, when I was reviewing your grandmother's insurance policy, I noticed she that didn't specify an e-mail address, and that got me thinking.
621	00:39:03	00:39:06	Some people her age aren't technologically savvy.
622	00:39:06	00:39:09	Maybe a GPS device would be intimidating to her.
623	00:39:09	00:39:12	I wondered if she actually even knew how to use it.
624	00:39:12	00:39:15	So I printed the unit and I found your fingerprints on it.
625	00:39:17	00:39:18	I installed it.
626	00:39:19	00:39:22	The prints just weren't on the base of the unit, they were on the face.
627	00:39:22	00:39:24	You punched in addresses.
628	00:39:25	00:39:34	If you were aware of your grandmother's intentions and programmed the GPS, you're guilty of aiding and abetting in the murder of three people.
629	00:39:36	00:39:38	Oh, God.
630	00:39:39	00:39:41	Uh...
631	00:39:41	00:39:46	Last week, she came by my place 'cause she said she didn't know how to work the GPS.
632	00:39:46	00:39:48	Okay, Grandma, look, it's really easy.
633	00:39:48	00:39:49	I'll explain it to you again.
634	00:39:49	00:39:53	You just type in the address of where you want to go.
635	00:39:53	00:39:59	Look, I swear, if I had known what she was planning, I would've stopped her.
636	00:40:00	00:40:01	Uh...
637	00:40:01	00:40:03	Well...
638	00:40:03	00:40:11	Corey, Homicide has informed us that your grandmother had a life insurance policy, in which you're the sole beneficiary.
639	00:40:13	00:40:16	I had no idea.
640	00:40:16	00:40:18	She never mentioned it to you?
641	00:40:18	00:40:19	No.
642	00:40:20	00:40:23	No, no, wait.
643	00:40:23	00:40:25	Promise me.
644	00:40:27	00:40:29	Okay, fine.
645	00:40:29	00:40:32	When I can afford it, I'll go back to college.
646	00:40:32	00:40:34	You should have a degree.
647	00:40:34	00:40:36	Grandma, I promise.
648	00:40:36	00:40:38	I love you.
649	00:40:38	00:40:41	You're such a good boy.
650	00:40:41	00:40:43	I love you, too.
651	00:40:43	00:40:47	Your grandmother's death has been ruled a suicide, which nullifies the policy.
652	00:40:48	00:40:49	There's not going to be any money.
653	00:40:49	00:40:52	No...
654	00:40:52	00:40:57	Look, I don't think you understand.
655	00:40:58	00:41:03	I loved my grandmother, and she's dead.
656	00:41:03	00:41:09	She killed herself, and she killed these three other people.
657	00:41:09	00:41:11	What are you telling me?
658	00:41:11	00:41:14	She killed these people for me?
659	00:41:14	00:41:18	And I'm supposed to live with this?
660	00:41:31	00:41:34	I'll meet you at the car.
661	00:41:35	00:41:36	I called the lab.
662	00:41:36	00:41:38	They said you were here.
663	00:41:39	00:41:42	I heard you met Elaine.
664	00:41:42	00:41:46	Yeah, she's really something.
665	00:41:48	00:41:52	I didn't tell her about us, if that's what you're wondering.
666	00:41:53	00:41:56	I'm really sorry, Sara.
667	00:41:56	00:41:59	Yeah, me, too.
668	00:41:59	00:42:02	I don't know what else to say.
669	00:42:02	00:42:06	I'll see you around.
670	00:42:33	00:42:35	You got plans?
671	00:42:35	00:42:37	Nope.
672	00:42:39	00:42:42	You want to get a beer?
673	00:42:46	00:42:48	Drive.
