0	00:00:09	00:00:16	I don't know what it is, but the vibe in this place always gets me feeling hot.
1	00:00:16	00:00:19	Sexy.
2	00:00:25	00:00:28	Don't tell me you don't feel it.
3	00:00:28	00:00:30	Do you want to take a ride?
4	00:00:33	00:00:34	Come on.
5	00:00:34	00:00:37	I know you want to.
6	00:00:38	00:00:40	That's why we're here.
7	00:00:40	00:00:42	Right?
8	00:00:47	00:00:48	The hiker called it in.
9	00:00:48	00:00:50	Saw something glittering near the trailhead.
10	00:00:50	00:00:50	Glittering?
11	00:00:50	00:00:53	Yeah, first he thought it was trash, maybe tinfoil.
12	00:00:53	00:00:55	Well, turns out it wasn't tinfoil at all.
13	00:00:58	00:00:59	More like a tin-woman.
14	00:01:00	00:01:02	She never found that yellow brick road.
15	00:01:02	00:01:03	No.
16	00:01:03	00:01:04	This is Crawford.
17	00:01:05	00:01:07	Hey, Nick.
18	00:01:07	00:01:09	Talk about your Silver Surfer, huh?
19	00:01:09	00:01:11	You get any I.D. on her yet? No purse.
20	00:01:11	00:01:13	The only thing on her besides this dress...
21	00:01:15	00:01:17	...is blunt-force trauma.
22	00:01:17	00:01:19	Do we have any idea on the time of death?
23	00:01:19	00:01:21	Jimmy, you got that, yeah?
24	00:01:21	00:01:23	00 a.m.
25	00:01:23	00:01:24	00 a.m.
26	00:01:24	00:01:27	00-- okay, thanks, Jimbo.
27	00:01:27	00:01:28	That's one hell of a sight.
28	00:01:28	00:01:29	Yeah.
29	00:01:29	00:01:31	That's straight out of Goldfinger.
30	00:01:31	00:01:32	What do you make of it?
31	00:01:32	00:01:40	I hate to speculate before we've collected any evidence, but this is Vegas, she could just be eye candy for some rich guy's party, for all we know.
32	00:01:40	00:01:42	Eye candy, really?
33	00:01:42	00:01:45	You can rent pretty girls like this and paint them up for parties nowadays.
34	00:01:45	00:01:49	If she was someone's eye candy fantasy, she's not anymore.
35	00:01:49	00:01:52	They chewed her up, and they spit her out.
36	00:01:52	00:01:54	Only in the Silver State.
37	00:03:36	00:03:40	Looks like our Silver Girl was more than just silver on the outside.
38	00:03:40	00:03:42	I found silver paint in both lungs.
39	00:03:42	00:03:45	So, blunt-force trauma was not cause of death.
40	00:03:45	00:03:46	No, she asphyxiated.
41	00:03:48	00:03:49	In silver paint.
42	00:03:51	00:03:53	Not something you see every day.
43	00:03:53	00:03:55	No, but this is, at least in this town.
44	00:03:55	00:03:57	Our girl here liked to party.
45	00:03:57	00:04:02	Nasal perforations and irritations in the lung passages suggest chronic drug use.
46	00:04:02	00:04:07	And besides the blunt-force trauma, I found other evidence of a struggle before she succumbed to the silver.
47	00:04:08	00:04:11	There's a linear contusion pattern over the trapezius here.
48	00:04:11	00:04:13	Looks like parallel lines.
49	00:04:13	00:04:16	Yeah, kind of like a barbecue grill.
50	00:04:16	00:04:18	Whatever it was, it impacted her strongly.
51	00:04:18	00:04:23	There's also a strange bruising pattern right here between the lines.
52	00:04:23	00:04:26	Dug out some glass particles from her elbow.
53	00:04:26	00:04:27	Might tell us what we're looking at.
54	00:04:28	00:04:30	Thanks, Doc.
55	00:04:30	00:04:31	Hey. Hey.
56	00:04:31	00:04:34	Got an I.D. on our Silver Girl.
57	00:04:34	00:04:36	Her prints were in the system.
58	00:04:36	00:04:39	Ava Montrose, a local with a long sheet.
59	00:04:39	00:04:41	Numerous burglary and drug arrests.
60	00:04:41	00:04:42	Next of kin?
61	00:04:42	00:04:46	Her last known address was her mother's place in Summerlin.
62	00:04:46	00:04:47	Her mom is on her way here now.
63	00:04:47	00:04:50	Sara's going to do the notification.
64	00:04:50	00:04:53	Mrs. Montrose, when was the last time you saw your daughter?
65	00:04:53	00:04:57	I haven't seen Ava for months.
66	00:04:57	00:05:00	I was always afraid something like this was going to happen.
67	00:05:00	00:05:03	Crowds she ran with, places she'd go.
68	00:05:03	00:05:05	What places would that be?
69	00:05:05	00:05:07	Places where you-you buy drugs.
70	00:05:09	00:05:13	Dangerous-looking drug dealer once showed up at our door, looking for her.
71	00:05:13	00:05:15	Did you catch the drug dealer's name?
72	00:05:15	00:05:16	No.
73	00:05:16	00:05:20	And Ava wouldn't say.
74	00:05:20	00:05:22	We never had the best relationship.
75	00:05:22	00:05:23	Why's that?
76	00:05:25	00:05:28	She resented me.
77	00:05:28	00:05:30	For taking the place of her father.
78	00:05:30	00:05:32	After Ruth and he split up.
79	00:05:32	00:05:33	It's not your fault, Duncan.
80	00:05:33	00:05:37	Truth is, Ava didn't listen to anybody but Ava.
81	00:05:39	00:05:41	Do you have children, Miss Sidle?
82	00:05:41	00:05:43	I don't.
83	00:05:43	00:05:45	It's not right for a mother to bury her daughter.
84	00:05:48	00:05:51	It's not right.
85	00:05:51	00:05:52	It's not right.
86	00:05:55	00:05:57	We are gonna find out who did this.
87	00:05:57	00:06:00	Is there anyone that you can think of that I should talk to?
88	00:06:00	00:06:01	A friend or boyfriend?
89	00:06:01	00:06:03	Ava had lots of boyfriends.
90	00:06:03	00:06:05	Nothing serious.
91	00:06:05	00:06:14	I-I wish I could help more, but Ava, her life, her friends, she was always a mystery to me.
92	00:06:19	00:06:20	Redecorating your mother's house?
93	00:06:20	00:06:22	I am, actually.
94	00:06:22	00:06:25	But that's not why I'm studying these shades of gray.
95	00:06:25	00:06:28	The silver covering our victim's body was indeed paint.
96	00:06:28	00:06:29	But not just any paint.
97	00:06:29	00:06:31	Chromic potassium sulfate.
98	00:06:31	00:06:33	Chrome? Exactly.
99	00:06:33	00:06:37	It's a new environmentally friendly chrome that's being used in the auto-painting industry.
100	00:06:37	00:06:39	This color is called silver zephyr.
101	00:06:41	00:06:43	What about the glass shards in her elbow?
102	00:06:43	00:06:44	They follow a similar road.
103	00:06:44	00:06:46	The glass is from a car headlamp.
104	00:06:46	00:06:48	It's made of bisphenal polycarbonate.
105	00:06:48	00:06:52	And it's suggestive of a non-sealed beam headlamp.
106	00:06:52	00:06:56	Now, those were discontinued by government mandate in 1939.
107	00:06:56	00:07:00	I'm thinking that Ava Montrose was in an altercation in close proximity to a car.
108	00:07:00	00:07:07	Now, Doc thought that these grill marks might be from a barbecue, but perhaps they're from a car.
109	00:07:07	00:07:11	And not just any car; a classic car, pre-1939.
110	00:07:11	00:07:13	Doesn't exactly narrow it down.
111	00:07:13	00:07:15	Unless, of course, you know what you're looking for.
112	00:07:52	00:07:54	That is a beautiful car.
113	00:07:54	00:07:57	1938 Packard Touring Sedan.
114	00:07:57	00:07:59	Pushrod straight-6.
115	00:07:59	00:08:00	130 horsepower.
116	00:08:00	00:08:02	And a symbol of a dying era.
117	00:08:02	00:08:04	You know, they went out of business a couple years later.
118	00:08:04	00:08:05	So, what?
119	00:08:05	00:08:08	You thinking that Ava Montrose had a run-in with this car?
120	00:08:08	00:08:10	Yeah, well, bruising on her back says so.
121	00:08:10	00:08:18	And I believe that the trauma to her neck was caused by the famous Packard Goddess of Speed hood ornament.
122	00:08:18	00:08:19	All right, I buy that.
123	00:08:19	00:08:22	Can't be that many 1938 Packards in Vegas.
124	00:08:22	00:08:24	I found two in the DMV.
125	00:08:24	00:08:29	First one is owned by a collector who kept it in his garage which burned down six months ago.
126	00:08:29	00:08:30	Scratch Packard number one.
127	00:08:30	00:08:35	Number two is alive and well, and owned by an investment banker named Carlo Derosa.
128	00:08:35	00:08:37	What do we know about him?
129	00:08:37	00:08:42	He won't return my calls, so he is either a very busy man, or he may be hiding something.
130	00:08:56	00:08:59	How much you want to bet this is Derosa?
131	00:09:00	00:09:02	Maybe.
132	00:09:02	00:09:07	All right, you know, I say that we just pay the fines, and then we can tell the regulators to shove it.
133	00:09:07	00:09:09	Excuse me, uh, Carlo Derosa?
134	00:09:09	00:09:11	Hi. I'm Julie Finlay. This is Sara Sidle.
135	00:09:11	00:09:12	We're with the crime lab. We need to speak with you.
136	00:09:12	00:09:15	No, no, no, I'm busy. Just call my office.
137	00:09:15	00:09:17	I got this.
138	00:09:22	00:09:25	Oh, oh, I-I'm sorry, did that just happen?
139	00:09:25	00:09:27	I can't hear you.
140	00:09:28	00:09:30	Oh, that's better.
141	00:09:30	00:09:31	What the hell is happening here?
142	00:09:31	00:09:33	Do you own a 1938 Packard?
143	00:09:33	00:09:35	Yes, I do. What's it to you?
144	00:09:35	00:09:38	A woman was killed last night, and the evidence traces to your car.
145	00:09:38	00:09:39	What woman?
146	00:09:39	00:09:41	What-what are you talking about?
147	00:09:41	00:09:42	Ava Montrose.
148	00:09:42	00:09:43	Do you know her?
149	00:09:43	00:09:46	Oh, my God, uh...
150	00:09:46	00:09:48	That's my ex-girlfriend.
151	00:09:48	00:09:50	Your ex? Yeah, yeah.
152	00:09:50	00:09:51	No, we broke up about a year ago.
153	00:09:51	00:09:52	I haven't seen her since.
154	00:09:53	00:09:55	Hang on. What happened here?
155	00:09:55	00:09:56	Where do you keep your Packard?
156	00:09:56	00:09:57	In the vault.
157	00:09:57	00:09:58	The vault?
158	00:09:58	00:10:00	Yeah, that's what I said, the vault.
159	00:10:00	00:10:04	It's in a warehouse downtown.
160	00:10:09	00:10:15	My dad was a classic car collector, and, uh, he built this place to keep his babies safe.
161	00:10:15	00:10:17	Somebody forget to pay the power bill?
162	00:10:17	00:10:18	Nope.
163	00:10:18	00:10:20	No, my dad liked to show his cars off.
164	00:10:20	00:10:23	His favorite part was the unveiling.
165	00:10:33	00:10:35	Welcome to car heaven.
166	00:10:35	00:10:36	Wow.
167	00:10:36	00:10:38	They don't make 'em like these anymore.
168	00:10:38	00:10:40	Is that a '57 Chevy?
169	00:10:40	00:10:40	You got it.
170	00:10:40	00:10:44	Uh, V-8 engine and twin barrel... blah, blah, blah, blah.
171	00:10:44	00:10:46	All I know is that it's old and it's slow.
172	00:10:46	00:10:49	That's one way to look at it.
173	00:10:49	00:10:50	Where's the Packard?
174	00:10:50	00:10:52	Oh! Um... yeah, it's getting a touch-up.
175	00:10:52	00:10:54	It's in the mechanic's bay.
176	00:10:54	00:10:56	What the hell's going on?
177	00:10:56	00:10:58	What do you think you're doing, Carlo?
178	00:10:58	00:10:59	I told you, no buyers!
179	00:10:59	00:11:01	No, you need to back up, dude, okay? Who are you?
180	00:11:01	00:11:03	The owner of these cars.
181	00:11:04	00:11:06	This is my charming brother, Aron.
182	00:11:06	00:11:07	And you are not the owner.
183	00:11:07	00:11:09	Neither are you. They're not for sale.
184	00:11:09	00:11:10	We're not buyers.
185	00:11:10	00:11:15	They're cops. SIDLE We're investigating a murder-- a woman named Ava Montrose.
186	00:11:17	00:11:18	Ava?
187	00:11:18	00:11:19	My ex, Aron.
188	00:11:19	00:11:20	You remember her.
189	00:11:20	00:11:23	It's hard to keep track of your bimbo parade.
190	00:11:23	00:11:25	I-I don't understand. What does this have to do with the vault?
191	00:11:37	00:11:38	Hey, Sara.
192	00:11:38	00:11:40	Can you come here a sec?
193	00:11:40	00:11:42	Hey. You keep an eye on them, please?
194	00:11:47	00:11:49	Is this our '38 Packard?
195	00:11:49	00:11:50	Yes, it is.
196	00:11:50	00:11:53	And there definitely was a struggle.
197	00:11:53	00:11:56	That ended with a fatal chrome bath.
198	00:11:59	00:11:59	Oh, check it out.
199	00:11:59	00:12:01	Couple of drops of chrome.
200	00:12:01	00:12:03	Kind of looks like they're heading out the door.
201	00:12:03	00:12:05	Yeah, maybe carrying our Silver Woman.
202	00:12:13	00:12:16	Yep, the trail ends right over here.
203	00:12:16	00:12:21	The only empty parking spot in the whole place.
204	00:12:21	00:12:23	Hey, guys, can you join us?
205	00:12:23	00:12:26	I assume there's usually a car parked here.
206	00:12:26	00:12:28	Oh, my God, where's the car?
207	00:12:28	00:12:29	What car?
208	00:12:29	00:12:30	The '76 Cadillac.
209	00:12:30	00:12:32	The most valuable car in the collection.
210	00:12:32	00:12:33	God, I can't believe this.
211	00:12:33	00:12:36	Caddy's gone. Ava's dead.
212	00:12:37	00:12:38	What the hell happened here?
213	00:12:38	00:12:39	Yeah, that's what we'd like to know.
214	00:12:39	00:12:43	Along with, what is it about your stolen car that was worth dying over?
215	00:12:47	00:12:49	I-I can't believe this is happening.
216	00:12:49	00:12:51	I mean, who would do this?
217	00:12:51	00:12:58	Aron, we found no signs of any break-in, so besides you and your brother, who else had access to the place?
218	00:12:58	00:12:59	Uh, just Rubio, our mechanic.
219	00:12:59	00:13:02	Uh, he's the only other person who would know the security code. And how well do you know him?
220	00:13:02	00:13:05	If you're asking if I trust him, absolutely.
221	00:13:05	00:13:07	He's been with the family for 20 years.
222	00:13:07	00:13:08	He's not even in the country right now.
223	00:13:08	00:13:10	He left for Italy two days ago.
224	00:13:10	00:13:11	What about you?
225	00:13:11	00:13:13	Where were you last night?
226	00:13:13	00:13:15	I was at my studio, painting.
227	00:13:15	00:13:17	Landscapes, not women.
228	00:13:17	00:13:18	And Carlo?
229	00:13:18	00:13:19	Where was he last night?
230	00:13:20	00:13:23	Uh, I was in my office until about midnight.
231	00:13:23	00:13:24	Anyone with you?
232	00:13:24	00:13:26	00.
233	00:13:26	00:13:29	How long were you dating Ava Montrose?
234	00:13:29	00:13:30	About a year.
235	00:13:30	00:13:35	I tried cutting it off six months into it, but, uh, she had a hard time letting go.
236	00:13:35	00:13:38	If you weren't with her last night, then what was she doing here?
237	00:13:38	00:13:40	That is a damn good question.
238	00:13:40	00:13:42	Is there any chance that Ava knew the security code?
239	00:13:42	00:13:43	We used to come down here a lot.
240	00:13:43	00:13:47	She could've, I guess, easily looked over my shoulder while I was punching it in.
241	00:13:47	00:13:48	I mean, she did love this place.
242	00:13:48	00:13:51	She especially loved my dad's old Caddy.
243	00:13:51	00:13:53	Enough to try and steal it?
244	00:13:53	00:13:54	Look...
245	00:13:54	00:13:56	Ava was a messed-up kid.
246	00:13:56	00:13:59	We both partied way too hard back in the day.
247	00:13:59	00:14:01	I mean, I cleaned up my act...
248	00:14:01	00:14:04	but Ava did not.
249	00:14:04	00:14:06	What can you tell me about this car?
250	00:14:06	00:14:07	'76 Caddy.
251	00:14:07	00:14:09	Sounds nice, but...
252	00:14:09	00:14:10	what, exactly, makes it so valuable?
253	00:14:11	00:14:13	My father was murdered in it.
254	00:14:13	00:14:15	And that makes it more valuable?
255	00:14:15	00:14:19	There's a certain crowd of collectors who pay serious money for so-called death cars.
256	00:14:19	00:14:23	James Dean's Porsche, Jayne Mansfield's Buick Electra...
257	00:14:23	00:14:25	I'm sorry, I don't recognize the name Derosa.
258	00:14:25	00:14:27	Your father was famous?
259	00:14:27	00:14:28	You're not from around here, are you?
260	00:14:28	00:14:29	No, I'm from Seattle.
261	00:14:29	00:14:31	My dad was Alfonz Derosa.
262	00:14:31	00:14:33	Kind of a Vegas legend.
263	00:14:33	00:14:38	Okay, so you're saying that he was murdered in the Cadillac?
264	00:14:38	00:14:40	He was gunned down by a hit man.
265	00:14:40	00:14:42	October 3, 1989.
266	00:14:42	00:14:45	Killer worked for Pete Bamonte, a Chicago loan shark.
267	00:14:45	00:14:48	I've heard that story, actually.
268	00:14:48	00:14:49	How much is the Cadillac worth?
269	00:14:49	00:14:50	It'd be close to a million.
270	00:14:50	00:14:52	And the rest of the collection?
271	00:14:52	00:14:55	All up, we'd be talking about five.
272	00:14:55	00:14:59	I gather, from your argument, that you're ready to sell, but your brother, Aron, isn't.
273	00:14:59	00:15:02	Yeah, we've been battling over what to do with the collection since, um...
274	00:15:02	00:15:04	our mom died.
275	00:15:04	00:15:04	When was that?
276	00:15:04	00:15:06	Two months ago.
277	00:15:06	00:15:09	According to the will, we both own equal shares in the cars.
278	00:15:09	00:15:11	I offered to split the... the collection in half.
279	00:15:11	00:15:12	You know, I'd sell mine, he could keep his.
280	00:15:12	00:15:16	Actually, you know, Aron's the one who could use the money, but...
281	00:15:16	00:15:18	Van Gogh won't compromise.
282	00:15:18	00:15:18	Van Gogh?
283	00:15:18	00:15:20	Kid's a starving artist.
284	00:15:22	00:15:22	The worst kind.
285	00:15:22	00:15:24	Talentless.
286	00:15:24	00:15:26	Anyway, he needs to grow up.
287	00:15:37	00:15:39	Talk about an icon of Vegas history.
288	00:15:39	00:15:40	Hmm.
289	00:15:40	00:15:43	Didn't you write a book about Vegas mobsters?
290	00:15:43	00:15:45	Alfonz Derosa had his own chapter.
291	00:15:45	00:15:46	What was his story?
292	00:15:46	00:15:48	Savvy businessman, ruthless killer.
293	00:15:48	00:15:51	He ran the skim at the Tangier's counting room.
294	00:15:51	00:15:53	Guy was known as The Vise.
295	00:15:53	00:15:55	I guess he didn't get his nickname for his woodworking.
296	00:15:55	00:15:58	It's how he broke his enemies' knees.
297	00:15:58	00:16:00	Mmm, they really don't make 'em like they used to. Nope.
298	00:16:00	00:16:02	So tell me about Derosa's murder.
299	00:16:02	00:16:09	Well, in 1989, The Vise was in a turf war with, uh, Pete Bamonte, some hothead from Chicago.
300	00:16:09	00:16:16	One night, The Vise took his mistress for a drive up to a lovers' lane near Mount Charleston.
301	00:16:16	00:16:17	That was his last ride.
302	00:16:20	00:16:21	They parked.
303	00:16:21	00:16:23	Romance was in the air.
304	00:16:23	00:16:26	Then the mood was broken...
305	00:16:26	00:16:30	and Alfonz Derosa and his mistress were dead.
306	00:16:30	00:16:34	Some hit man with ties to Bamonte was eventually convicted for the murder.
307	00:16:34	00:16:36	Some jailhouse snitch dimed him out.
308	00:16:36	00:16:38	He eventually died in prison.
309	00:16:38	00:16:39	And what happened to the sons?
310	00:16:39	00:16:40	They must've been pretty young.
311	00:16:40	00:16:41	Their mother raised them.
312	00:16:41	00:16:45	And as far as anybody can tell, they didn't follow in their dad's footsteps.
313	00:16:45	00:16:50	So now one's an investment banker and one's an artist, and they hate each other.
314	00:16:50	00:16:52	And they both have access to this place.
315	00:16:52	00:16:54	I don't believe a word either one of them says.
316	00:16:54	00:16:58	So maybe our witness on wheels can help us.
317	00:17:08	00:17:12	Looks like we've got blood on the hood ornament.
318	00:17:12	00:17:15	That would confirm your theory that Ava had a run-in with the car.
319	00:17:25	00:17:26	Got something else.
320	00:17:26	00:17:27	She broke a heel.
321	00:17:31	00:17:35	I think there's some residue on it.
322	00:17:40	00:17:42	Got a partial shoe impression.
323	00:17:42	00:17:45	Could be.
324	00:17:45	00:17:48	So Ava breaks her heel trying to get away.
325	00:17:48	00:17:51	Killer grabs her near the chrome vat.
326	00:17:57	00:17:59	Gives her a silver dye job to die for.
327	00:17:59	00:18:03	Puts the body in the Caddy...
328	00:18:04	00:18:11	...and drives away.
329	00:18:13	00:18:20	I know you don't trust the brothers, but if one of them did it, why not clean up?
330	00:18:20	00:18:21	You have a point.
331	00:18:25	00:18:27	You got something?
332	00:18:27	00:18:28	Yeah.
333	00:18:35	00:18:38	It's a promotional magnet.
334	00:18:38	00:18:39	Cienzo's Pizzeria.
335	00:18:39	00:18:41	Specks of chrome on it.
336	00:18:41	00:18:43	Says to me this was here last night.
337	00:18:43	00:18:44	Maybe the killer dropped it.
338	00:18:44	00:18:47	Gives us something to sink our teeth into.
339	00:18:51	00:18:53	Ah! Pizza party.
340	00:18:53	00:18:55	Thanks for the invite.
341	00:18:55	00:18:57	All right, I've only got a little while here.
342	00:18:57	00:18:57	What do you got?
343	00:18:57	00:18:59	Mmm. Mmm. Yeah.
344	00:18:59	00:19:02	I ran touch DNA on the security keypad at the vault.
345	00:19:02	00:19:05	Besides the brothers, I found a match to Ava Montrose.
346	00:19:05	00:19:07	Confirms she knew the password.
347	00:19:07	00:19:11	And suggesting maybe she graduated from stealing watches to stealing cars.
348	00:19:11	00:19:14	Is that all you got there, Papa John?
349	00:19:14	00:19:15	Far from it.
350	00:19:15	00:19:18	This is a slice of Cienzo's pizza.
351	00:19:18	00:19:20	Uh, the pizza parlor with the promotional magnet.
352	00:19:20	00:19:20	We were just there.
353	00:19:20	00:19:21	Thin crust.
354	00:19:21	00:19:22	Very New Yorky. Delish.
355	00:19:23	00:19:25	I don't suppose one of their employees is our killer?
356	00:19:25	00:19:27	None of them has a record, if that's what you're asking.
357	00:19:27	00:19:29	And none of them collects cars.
358	00:19:29	00:19:34	However, I did run the credit cards for the past week and came across a very interesting customer.
359	00:19:34	00:19:35	Henry.
360	00:19:36	00:19:37	What?
361	00:19:37	00:19:38	The magnets, please.
362	00:19:38	00:19:40	Right, right.
363	00:19:40	00:19:42	I'm sorry.
364	00:19:42	00:19:45	We picked up these exemplar magnets at the pizzeria.
365	00:19:45	00:19:50	I think I can use them to explain what the magnet that Greg found was doing at the classic car vault.
366	00:19:50	00:19:52	Allow me to demonstrate.
367	00:19:54	00:19:56	You're showing me how a magnet works.
368	00:19:57	00:19:59	Are you looking to get fired today?
369	00:19:59	00:20:01	Wait for it.
370	00:20:03	00:20:04	Voilà.
371	00:20:04	00:20:07	The magnet sticks to one side of the fender, but not the other. Why?
372	00:20:07	00:20:10	Because this part of the fender has been repaired.
373	00:20:10	00:20:13	It's made with Bondo automotive filler.
374	00:20:13	00:20:14	So the magnet didn't stick.
375	00:20:14	00:20:17	It's a little trick that car appraisers use.
376	00:20:17	00:20:18	And...
377	00:20:18	00:20:24	according to credit card records, there is a certain Vegas car appraiser who eats at Cienzo's once a week.
378	00:20:28	00:20:30	Thanks for coming in, Mr. Bixler.
379	00:20:30	00:20:33	I have a couple of questions about your car appraisal business.
380	00:20:33	00:20:35	Whatever you need.
381	00:20:35	00:20:37	Are you familiar with the Alfonz Derosa collection?
382	00:20:37	00:20:38	Intimately.
383	00:20:38	00:20:43	I was, uh, recently hired by the estate to appraise their cars, just after Mrs. Derosa passed away.
384	00:20:43	00:20:44	When was that?
385	00:20:44	00:20:46	Uh, about two months ago. Hmm.
386	00:20:46	00:20:49	So you haven't been back to the vault since?
387	00:20:49	00:20:51	No.
388	00:20:51	00:20:53	I see.
389	00:20:53	00:20:58	I understand that you're also a regular at Cienzo's Pizzeria on Flamingo.
390	00:20:58	00:21:00	Guilty as charged.
391	00:21:00	00:21:02	Uh, is that a crime?
392	00:21:02	00:21:03	I mean, I know that it's not good for me...
393	00:21:03	00:21:06	Have you ever used one of their magnets to appraise a car?
394	00:21:06	00:21:07	Uh, yes.
395	00:21:07	00:21:09	Uh, yeah, they're quite handy.
396	00:21:09	00:21:11	Explains why we found one in the vault.
397	00:21:11	00:21:15	Um, yeah, um, like I said, I was there two months ago.
398	00:21:15	00:21:16	Mm-hmm.
399	00:21:16	00:21:18	Well, the pizzeria has a great special right now.
400	00:21:18	00:21:21	Large, two toppings for $7.99.
401	00:21:21	00:21:24	But it just started this week.
402	00:21:24	00:21:27	And we found this magnet in Derosa's vault yesterday.
403	00:21:27	00:21:30	It's the same place where a woman named Ava Montrose was murdered.
404	00:21:30	00:21:34	I do not like being lied to.
405	00:21:34	00:21:35	Were you there last night?
406	00:21:35	00:21:36	No.
407	00:21:36	00:21:37	I swear, no. I...
408	00:21:37	00:21:39	Come on, Mr. Bixler.
409	00:21:39	00:21:41	Uh, but I was there three days ago.
410	00:21:41	00:21:44	So first it was two months ago, and now it's three days ago.
411	00:21:44	00:21:46	Look, I realize I lied to you. I'm sorry.
412	00:21:46	00:21:48	Um, I have a very good reason.
413	00:21:48	00:21:50	What's that?
414	00:21:50	00:21:56	Carlo Derosa, uh, he hired me to do an updated appraisal of a '76 Cadillac.
415	00:21:56	00:21:58	A very generous one.
416	00:21:58	00:21:59	He can be most persuasive.
417	00:21:59	00:22:01	Why did he want a new appraisal?
418	00:22:01	00:22:04	He wouldn't tell me. I can only assume that he had a buyer lined up.
419	00:22:04	00:22:05	Did his brother Aron know about it?
420	00:22:05	00:22:07	No.
421	00:22:07	00:22:10	No, if he found out, I'm sure he would have blocked the sale.
422	00:22:10	00:22:13	Look, I'm a little scared telling you all this.
423	00:22:13	00:22:14	Um...
424	00:22:16	00:22:20	Uh, you know who Carlo Derosa's father was?
425	00:22:20	00:22:22	Yeah, I know.
426	00:22:22	00:22:25	You know, this whole thing is starting to look more and more like an inside job.
427	00:22:25	00:22:27	One that went sideways.
428	00:22:27	00:22:29	Carlo Derosa wants to sell his father's Caddy.
429	00:22:29	00:22:31	His brother gets wind of the sale and stops him.
430	00:22:31	00:22:35	Right, so Carlo calls his morally-challenged ex-girlfriend.
431	00:22:35	00:22:39	But he doesn't want to get his hands dirty, and he needs an alibi.
432	00:22:39	00:22:41	So maybe Ava enlists one of her sketchy friends to help.
433	00:22:41	00:22:43	Someone with experience in auto theft.
434	00:22:43	00:22:45	Friend sees the car, gets greedy...
435	00:22:45	00:22:49	Kills her, takes the car, dumps her body.
436	00:22:49	00:22:50	Hey.
437	00:22:50	00:22:51	We need to talk shoes.
438	00:22:52	00:22:54	Not yours.
439	00:22:54	00:22:57	Just got the result on the trace we found on Ava's broken heel.
440	00:22:57	00:23:01	Elements of concrete and titanium oxide.
441	00:23:01	00:23:01	Now, I've seen this before.
442	00:23:01	00:23:04	It's a unique road-paving material they use to eliminate pollution.
443	00:23:04	00:23:07	It's found on a half-mile strip of Verdugo Street.
444	00:23:07	00:23:09	That's an industrial neighborhood, right?
445	00:23:09	00:23:10	Exactly.
446	00:23:10	00:23:16	And I did some searching-- it's the exact neighborhood it'a the exact neighborhood where Ava Montrose just rented a 20-by-20 storage unit.
447	00:23:16	00:23:18	That's the perfect size to hide a car.
448	00:23:29	00:23:32	Busted lock-- someone got here before us.
449	00:23:45	00:23:47	LVPD.
450	00:23:47	00:23:49	Anybody in here?
451	00:23:49	00:23:50	Here's our Caddy.
452	00:23:51	00:23:53	Yeah.
453	00:23:56	00:23:58	LVPD. Come on out.
454	00:24:00	00:24:01	Listen to me.
455	00:24:01	00:24:06	If you don't want to die today, show yourself slowly.
456	00:24:11	00:24:13	Let me see some hands.
457	00:24:16	00:24:19	You're making a mistake.
458	00:24:19	00:24:21	No, you're the one who's made the mistake.
459	00:24:25	00:24:30	Aron, you mind telling me what you were doing in a murdered woman's storage space with a stolen car?
460	00:24:30	00:24:31	It's not what it looks like. No?
461	00:24:31	00:24:33	Well, I'll tell you what it looks like to me.
462	00:24:33	00:24:41	You recruited Ava Montrose, your brother's ex, the one you barely remembered, to help you steal your Daddy's Caddy before your brother could sell it.
463	00:24:41	00:24:43	So, what happened?
464	00:24:43	00:24:47	Uh, Ava-- the whacked-out drug addict-- did she try to play you somehow?
465	00:24:47	00:24:47	You get angry.
466	00:24:47	00:24:49	Things get ugly.
467	00:24:49	00:24:50	You got it wrong.
468	00:24:50	00:24:53	About Ava and about me.
469	00:24:53	00:24:54	I do?
470	00:24:54	00:24:55	Oh, uh, okay.
471	00:24:55	00:24:57	Well, e-enlighten me.
472	00:24:57	00:24:59	I'm not a thief, and I'm not a murderer.
473	00:24:59	00:25:01	And Ava?
474	00:25:01	00:25:03	She was an addict, but she wasn't a whack-job.
475	00:25:03	00:25:05	She was a beautiful soul.
476	00:25:05	00:25:07	It sounds like you're the one that had a thing for her.
477	00:25:07	00:25:09	She loved me.
478	00:25:09	00:25:11	She left Carlo for me. Right.
479	00:25:11	00:25:13	No, that kind of thing happens all the time.
480	00:25:13	00:25:17	Uh, girl dumps a high-rolling, Mercedes-driving investment banker for a...
481	00:25:17	00:25:21	I'm sorry, where do you work?
482	00:25:21	00:25:22	I manage a copy store.
483	00:25:22	00:25:26	And there's nothing wrong with that, but maybe you see my point.
484	00:25:26	00:25:27	Believe what you want.
485	00:25:27	00:25:29	I don't give a rat's ass.
486	00:25:29	00:25:32	All I know is Carlo is the one who got to her.
487	00:25:32	00:25:34	He knew exactly how to do it.
488	00:25:34	00:25:39	With drugs? Carlo's the one who put Ava up to stealing the Caddy. I know it.
489	00:25:39	00:25:41	He's the one who wanted to sell it. I wouldn't...
490	00:25:41	00:25:46	It's a great story, Aron, but it still doesn't explain why you're the one we found in that storage locker!
491	00:25:46	00:25:49	I was trying to get my car back.
492	00:25:49	00:25:50	I set up a credit card in Ava's name.
493	00:25:50	00:25:55	Bills came to me, I saw she rented a storage unit, I put two and two together-- that's why I was there.
494	00:25:55	00:25:57	That car means everything to me.
495	00:25:59	00:26:01	It's the way I remember my father.
496	00:26:01	00:26:04	Right, because that's where he died.
497	00:26:04	00:26:05	No.
498	00:26:05	00:26:07	No, because that's where he really lived.
499	00:26:08	00:26:11	I used to stay up late drawing.
500	00:26:11	00:26:13	And Carlo would be asleep.
501	00:26:13	00:26:20	My dad would come in and grab me, and... and we'd go for a ride.
502	00:26:20	00:26:21	Just the two of us.
503	00:26:21	00:26:24	Will you buy me a car like this when I'm grown-up, Daddy?
504	00:26:24	00:26:26	I'll get you 20 of them, Aron.
505	00:26:26	00:26:27	Sky's the limit, kid.
506	00:26:30	00:26:34	Aron, were you with your father the night he was murdered?
507	00:26:34	00:26:36	It was our last ride together.
508	00:26:36	00:26:38	He, uh, dropped me off at a diner.
509	00:26:39	00:26:43	Said he'd be back in an hour.
510	00:26:43	00:26:48	I mean, I know my dad wasn't a saint, but he was good to me.
511	00:26:48	00:26:49	What about Carlo?
512	00:26:49	00:26:52	They fought.
513	00:26:52	00:26:54	They were too much alike.
514	00:26:54	00:26:56	That's how I know he stole it.
515	00:26:56	00:27:00	He's stealing from the house-- he learned that from my dad.
516	00:27:10	00:27:14	Do you want to drive the car where 'The Vise' was murdered?
517	00:27:14	00:27:16	Yeah, not so much.
518	00:27:16	00:27:18	Well, someone wanted to drive that car.
519	00:27:18	00:27:20	Where'd you find this?
520	00:27:20	00:27:25	Carlo Derosa posted it a week ago on Farringer's car auction Web site.
521	00:27:25	00:27:31	According to Carlo's bank records, an anonymous buyer put down $100,000 on the car.
522	00:27:31	00:27:34	But we know that brother Aron stopped the sale.
523	00:27:34	00:27:37	Yes, but there's no indication that Carlo returned the deposit.
524	00:27:37	00:27:40	Suggesting that he hadn't given up on the idea of selling it.
525	00:27:40	00:27:47	So, where are we? We got one brother who's willing to steal the car to sell it, the other one willing to steal it to protect it.
526	00:27:47	00:27:49	So which brother did it?
527	00:27:49	00:27:50	I don't think it was either one of them.
528	00:27:50	00:27:52	You remember the shoe impression we found at the scene?
529	00:27:52	00:27:53	Yeah.
530	00:27:53	00:27:57	We compared it to all the shoes the brothers owned, and we did not get a match.
531	00:27:57	00:27:59	Doesn't mean that the shoes weren't thrown away.
532	00:27:59	00:28:00	That's true.
533	00:28:00	00:28:02	But it's also true that we could be looking for somebody else.
534	00:28:02	00:28:04	A scorned buyer, perhaps.
535	00:28:04	00:28:09	Okay, so a buyer's interested in the Mob car, maybe uses Mob tactics to get it.
536	00:28:09	00:28:12	Any luck on following the money trail?
537	00:28:12	00:28:14	No, it all leads to offshore accounts.
538	00:28:14	00:28:15	And no names.
539	00:28:15	00:28:18	But I will keep working on it.
540	00:28:18	00:28:21	How come you know so much about classic cars?
541	00:28:21	00:28:23	Cute guy in shop class.
542	00:28:23	00:28:24	No, seriously.
543	00:28:24	00:28:28	Actually, uh, my brother owned a '57 Chevy rust bucket.
544	00:28:28	00:28:30	Left it in the garage when he went to college.
545	00:28:30	00:28:31	Totally forgot about it.
546	00:28:31	00:28:35	And then, when I got a little older, I needed a way to get to school, so...
547	00:28:35	00:28:36	You fixed it up.
548	00:28:36	00:28:40	Took the engine completely apart and reassembled it piece by piece.
549	00:28:40	00:28:44	I found it really interesting to see how it all connected.
550	00:28:44	00:28:47	Carburetor as crime scene.
551	00:28:47	00:28:50	Yeah, it's all in the details.
552	00:28:59	00:29:01	I can't believe this backseat.
553	00:29:01	00:29:03	You could have a picnic in there.
554	00:29:03	00:29:06	I think Alfonz and his mistress were up to more than that.
555	00:29:06	00:29:08	Talk about a last ride.
556	00:29:12	00:29:15	I think I may have found something from our killer's last ride.
557	00:29:15	00:29:17	Some sort of fiber.
558	00:29:30	00:29:33	I think I found a chrome flake, too.
559	00:29:33	00:29:34	Could be from our Silver Woman.
560	00:29:34	00:29:37	We know this car was used for the body dump.
561	00:29:37	00:29:39	Maybe she was transported in the trunk.
562	00:29:39	00:29:40	You look in there yet?
563	00:29:40	00:29:43	Nope.
564	00:29:43	00:29:44	Let's check it out.
565	00:29:51	00:29:52	Oh.
566	00:29:52	00:29:55	A tarp with chrome paint and blood.
567	00:29:55	00:29:56	Confirms that theory.
568	00:29:56	00:29:57	Yep.
569	00:30:00	00:30:02	Ooh, what's that?
570	00:30:03	00:30:07	A copy of Ken Bixler's appraisal of this car.
571	00:30:07	00:30:10	Looks like it was printed from the Farringer Web site.
572	00:30:10	00:30:13	Well, maybe this printout will give us a print.
573	00:30:19	00:30:20	I got a partial.
574	00:30:21	00:30:23	Not sure if it'll be enough for AFIS, though.
575	00:30:23	00:30:28	Well, then, let's hope that our mystery buyer left some epithelials behind.
576	00:30:33	00:30:35	Find anything?
577	00:30:35	00:30:37	Hey, Morgan, what do you got?
578	00:30:37	00:30:40	I just got results on the touch DNA from the appraisal report.
579	00:30:40	00:30:42	So who's the buyer of the Cadillac?
580	00:30:42	00:30:46	Results come back as a female familial match to Ava Montrose.
581	00:30:46	00:30:48	And she doesn't have any sisters or daughters.
582	00:30:48	00:30:50	That just leaves her mother.
583	00:30:50	00:30:52	Ruth Montrose.
584	00:30:52	00:30:54	Ruth Montrose is our buyer.
585	00:30:54	00:30:58	And if our theory is correct, she's not just our buyer; she's our killer.
586	00:31:03	00:31:05	You must help me get this car.
587	00:31:05	00:31:07	Don't must me, Mother.
588	00:31:07	00:31:10	This fiasco's all yours, not mine.
589	00:31:10	00:31:15	Darling, I have borrowed a lot of money from some very disreputable men.
590	00:31:15	00:31:17	If I don't pay them, Lord knows what's going to happen to me.
591	00:31:17	00:31:19	Do you understand?
592	00:31:19	00:31:21	I understand perfectly.
593	00:31:21	00:31:23	You need me.
594	00:31:23	00:31:26	I have never asked you for anything.
595	00:31:26	00:31:30	So you admit to using your own daughter to help steal a car.
596	00:31:30	00:31:32	Ava knew how to get into the vault.
597	00:31:32	00:31:35	It's appalling, I know.
598	00:31:35	00:31:38	I can't argue with that.
599	00:31:38	00:31:40	Why did you need to buy the car so badly?
600	00:31:40	00:31:41	I wasn't the buyer.
601	00:31:41	00:31:44	I was just an intermediary for a wealthy gentleman from Dubai.
602	00:31:44	00:31:47	I met him at a party a month ago.
603	00:31:47	00:31:49	He loves Mob lore and cars.
604	00:31:49	00:31:52	I told him that Alfonz Derosa's death car was for sale.
605	00:31:52	00:31:53	And he was interested?
606	00:31:53	00:31:55	He was ready to pay two million when he came back from Dubai.
607	00:31:55	00:31:57	Double the appraisal, double the purchase price.
608	00:31:57	00:31:59	That's not a bad profit.
609	00:31:59	00:32:03	So, you borrowed the money from a loan shark to make the deposit.
610	00:32:03	00:32:04	Yes.
611	00:32:04	00:32:08	And then that sentimental fool, Aron Derosa, canceled the sale.
612	00:32:08	00:32:10	And that's when your problems really started.
613	00:32:12	00:32:14	What happened to Ava in that vault?
614	00:32:15	00:32:18	I have no idea.
615	00:32:18	00:32:20	Yeah, see, I thought we were getting somewhere.
616	00:32:20	00:32:22	I wasn't there.
617	00:32:22	00:32:24	I would never murder my own daughter.
618	00:32:24	00:32:25	I wish I could believe that, Ms. Montrose.
619	00:32:25	00:32:27	I've seen a lot over the years.
620	00:32:27	00:32:29	Nothing surprises me.
621	00:32:29	00:32:33	Believe what you will.
622	00:32:33	00:32:35	I think Ava brought an unsavory friend to help her.
623	00:32:36	00:32:39	And then something went terribly wrong.
624	00:32:40	00:32:43	Well, she's not gonna win mother of the year awards.
625	00:32:43	00:32:45	But would she kill her own daughter?
626	00:32:45	00:32:46	You believe her story?
627	00:32:46	00:32:49	Well, I think there's a pragmatic woman under all that crazy, (phone chirps)
628	00:32:49	00:32:51	and her daughter's more valuable alive than dead.
629	00:32:51	00:32:57	Mmm. Greg wants to know if I feel like taking a ride back to the past.
630	00:32:58	00:33:02	Boy, this looks like it could all be part of a new edition for your book.
631	00:33:02	00:33:03	Could be.
632	00:33:03	00:33:06	But I also think it relates to Ava Montrose's murder.
633	00:33:06	00:33:08	This is Pete Bamonte.
634	00:33:08	00:33:11	Chicago loan shark and the guy behind Alfonz Derosa's murder.
635	00:33:11	00:33:13	Right, he hired the hit man to do it.
636	00:33:13	00:33:18	When I was researching the Derosa murder from '89, I discovered that Bamonte had a son.
637	00:33:18	00:33:19	Bamonte got divorced.
638	00:33:19	00:33:23	His wife remarried, and then his son took his stepfather's last name, which was Reidel.
639	00:33:23	00:33:26	Reidel, as in Duncan Reidel?
640	00:33:26	00:33:31	Ruth Montrose's boyfriend is Pete Bamonte's son?
641	00:33:31	00:33:38	I'm saying maybe we have a new suspect, and maybe Ruth Montrose's story about a buyer in Dubai was just a story.
642	00:33:38	00:33:41	And the real buyer is a little closer to home.
643	00:33:41	00:33:42	Okay, so where's our proof?
644	00:33:42	00:33:45	How are we doing with the, uh, trace that we got from the Caddy?
645	00:33:45	00:33:46	Finn's working on it.
646	00:33:51	00:33:52	Where you headed?
647	00:33:53	00:33:55	I'm not sure.
648	00:33:55	00:34:02	So, if you're right and Duncan Reidel is the killer, then he must have done restoration work before he killed Ava.
649	00:34:02	00:34:03	What do you mean?
650	00:34:03	00:34:06	Well, I got the results back from the fiber that we found on the passenger seat.
651	00:34:06	00:34:08	Cannabis sativa.
652	00:34:08	00:34:09	Hemp.
653	00:34:09	00:34:10	It's used for upholstery stuffing.
654	00:34:10	00:34:15	And the thing I know about classic cars is they did not use hemp in the carpet or in the seat lining.
655	00:34:15	00:34:17	Not in 1976, anyway.
656	00:34:17	00:34:20	Also, check out the result on the chrome.
657	00:34:20	00:34:23	It's not chromic potassium sulfate.
658	00:34:23	00:34:24	It didn't come off the girl.
659	00:34:24	00:34:26	It must have flaked off the car.
660	00:34:26	00:34:28	But on what part of the car?
661	00:34:28	00:34:32	Yeah, that is what I am trying to figure out.
662	00:34:32	00:34:39	Well, we found both pieces of trace here, near the passenger seat.
663	00:34:44	00:34:46	The chrome on the headrest post is flaking.
664	00:34:46	00:34:48	Someone messed with it.
665	00:34:48	00:34:53	Maybe the killer swapped out the original headrest with a new one, reupholstered with hemp.
666	00:34:53	00:34:55	There's one way to know for sure.
667	00:34:55	00:35:01	After Alfonz and his mistress were shot, this entire seat was covered in blood.
668	00:35:09	00:35:14	When is the last time someone was shot in the head in a car and didn't leave any blood on the headrest?
669	00:35:14	00:35:16	How about never?
670	00:35:16	00:35:19	So, Ava's killer replaced the headrest.
671	00:35:19	00:35:21	Why?
672	00:35:21	00:35:27	The hit man who went to prison for the murder of Alfonz Derosa wasn't convicted on evidence.
673	00:35:27	00:35:30	He was convicted on the word of a jailhouse snitch.
674	00:35:30	00:35:31	So you're thinking he was set up?
675	00:35:31	00:35:35	Yeah, maybe there was a different shooter, someone closer to the guy who ordered the hit.
676	00:35:35	00:35:39	In 1989, Duncan Reidel was 18 years old.
677	00:35:39	00:35:42	So, Duncan could've been the one to pull the trigger for his father.
678	00:35:42	00:35:46	And maybe there was something in that headrest that could've proven it.
679	00:35:46	00:35:47	Like a bullet.
680	00:35:47	00:35:53	Exactly. So let's see if there's something on this headrest that will help us make our case today.
681	00:36:27	00:36:27	Hey.
682	00:36:27	00:36:30	Did you get an I.D. off the headrest? Yeah, I did.
683	00:36:30	00:36:31	Not who we expected.
684	00:36:31	00:36:33	Reidel's off the hook.
685	00:36:33	00:36:34	So who is it?
686	00:36:34	00:36:38	You know, it's interesting, what a car means to different people.
687	00:36:38	00:36:40	You take this Cadillac.
688	00:36:40	00:36:44	To Carlo Derosa, it means revenge.
689	00:36:44	00:36:49	Selling it's a great way to get back at a father who cared more about his cars than about him.
690	00:36:49	00:36:52	Yeah, to Aron Derosa, keeping it is a way of remembering that father.
691	00:36:52	00:36:53	To him, the car means love.
692	00:36:53	00:36:56	Right, we-we were just wondering...
693	00:36:56	00:36:57	What did it mean to you?
694	00:37:00	00:37:02	Mr. Bixler?
695	00:37:02	00:37:05	Um... (chuckles) nothing.
696	00:37:05	00:37:07	I mean, I mean, not a damn thing.
697	00:37:07	00:37:09	It was just a part of my job.
698	00:37:09	00:37:10	Wrong answer, Ken.
699	00:37:10	00:37:17	Yeah, we-we kind of figured that, to you, the car means heartbreak.
700	00:37:17	00:37:18	Heartbreak?
701	00:37:18	00:37:20	I... What are you talking about?
702	00:37:20	00:37:25	You see, Ken, we found your DNA on the passenger side headrest.
703	00:37:25	00:37:28	Well, uh, I inspected that headrest, so...
704	00:37:28	00:37:31	No, actually, the headrest you inspected was the old headrest.
705	00:37:31	00:37:33	The manufactured one.
706	00:37:33	00:37:35	We're talking about the new headrest.
707	00:37:35	00:37:36	And that's because you replaced it.
708	00:37:36	00:37:41	We, uh, recovered the old headrest in the Dumpster behind your appraisal office, and your prints were on that.
709	00:37:41	00:37:48	We also found an expended bullet that was a direct match to a Beretta manufactured in 1980.
710	00:37:48	00:37:50	Your Beretta.
711	00:37:50	00:37:54	It's the same gun you fired last year when you thought an intruder was breaking into your house.
712	00:37:54	00:37:56	Remember, the cops were called?
713	00:37:56	00:37:59	The bullet and the gun were processed and then put in the system.
714	00:37:59	00:38:03	And it's also the same gun that was used to murder Alfonz Derosa.
715	00:38:03	00:38:07	Yeah, unfortunately, though... The recovered bullets were too degraded to process.
716	00:38:07	00:38:14	Right, but in the cops' defense, they didn't realize that you fired three shots, not two.
717	00:38:14	00:38:17	A stray round going into the headrest.
718	00:38:29	00:38:31	The cops thought it was a professional hit.
719	00:38:31	00:38:36	They didn't realize it was just an enraged car salesman with a shaky hand.
720	00:38:36	00:38:40	Why'd you feel like you had to kill him in the first place?
721	00:38:40	00:38:41	You barely knew the guy.
722	00:38:42	00:38:45	I wasn't there to kill Alfonz.
723	00:38:45	00:38:48	I was there to kill Vera.
724	00:38:48	00:38:49	Vera Scanell.
725	00:38:49	00:38:50	Alfonz's mistress.
726	00:38:50	00:38:51	My fiancée.
727	00:38:52	00:38:54	What a beautiful wreck she was.
728	00:38:54	00:38:57	She never cared how much pain she caused me.
729	00:38:57	00:39:00	The humiliation.
730	00:39:00	00:39:02	They both got what was coming to them.
731	00:39:02	00:39:03	I didn't regret it for a second.
732	00:39:03	00:39:09	Until 30 years later when you realized that you left some evidence behind.
733	00:39:09	00:39:11	Ken, what about Ava?
734	00:39:11	00:39:13	How'd she play into this?
735	00:39:13	00:39:15	I've known her for years.
736	00:39:15	00:39:17	I was friends with her dealer.
737	00:39:17	00:39:19	I used to help him launder money.
738	00:39:19	00:39:25	She came to me about a week ago, telling me about her mom's plan to steal the car.
739	00:39:25	00:39:27	They wanted help getting it out of the country.
740	00:39:27	00:39:34	But with the car being sold, you were worried that the bullet in the headrest would be discovered and finally matched to your Beretta.
741	00:39:34	00:39:37	I had to get it out.
742	00:39:37	00:39:39	I sent her away.
743	00:39:39	00:39:44	I sent her away for an hour or so so I could get my work done.
744	00:39:45	00:39:46	Too bad she had to come back.
745	00:39:49	00:39:52	The vibe in this place always gets me feeling hot.
746	00:39:52	00:39:53	Sexy.
747	00:39:53	00:39:55	Do you want to take a ride?
748	00:39:55	00:39:56	The hell you doing here?
749	00:39:56	00:39:58	I got bored. Let's go.
750	00:39:58	00:39:59	Now.
751	00:39:59	00:40:01	The car's not ready yet.
752	00:40:01	00:40:04	I thought you said you were working on the engine.
753	00:40:05	00:40:08	What are you up to, Kenny boy?
754	00:40:08	00:40:10	You got an angle, don't you?
755	00:40:10	00:40:13	What is it? I want in. Stay out of it, Ava.
756	00:40:14	00:40:16	Now I know it's good.
757	00:40:16	00:40:19	You want me to stay out of it, it's gonna cost...
758	00:40:23	00:40:25	I told you to stay the hell out of here!
759	00:40:25	00:40:25	Come here! Get back!
760	00:40:25	00:40:28	Come back! (grunts)
761	00:40:32	00:40:33	Come here. Come on!
762	00:41:00	00:41:02	Just talked to Carlo Derosa.
763	00:41:02	00:41:05	He's sending someone over to pick up the Caddy.
764	00:41:05	00:41:09	Well, Bixler did confess, so the car's not evidence anymore.
765	00:41:09	00:41:10	What about Aron Derosa?
766	00:41:10	00:41:12	Still doesn't want to sell?
767	00:41:12	00:41:14	Actually, the brothers finally compromised.
768	00:41:14	00:41:16	They're donating the car to the Mob Museum.
769	00:41:16	00:41:19	Oh, that sounds like a good place for her.
770	00:41:19	00:41:24	Still such a shame that she's never gonna see the road again.
771	00:41:26	00:41:28	One last ride?
772	00:41:28	00:41:30	I thought you'd never ask.
