0	00:00:30	00:00:32	Stop! No!
1	00:00:42	00:00:44	You're delicious.
2	00:00:44	00:00:46	Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
3	00:00:46	00:00:47	Hang on a second.
4	00:00:47	00:00:49	Now you're saying your attacker looked like me?
5	00:00:49	00:00:53	But ten minutes ago, you said, I couldn't see him 'cause I was blindfolded.
6	00:00:53	00:00:57	That is technically right, but by the sound of his voice, I could... I could totally picture him.
7	00:00:57	00:00:59	All right. Okay.
8	00:00:59	00:01:05	So this shadowy figure, who looks just like my colleague here, grabs you off the street... Blindfolds you.
9	00:01:05	00:01:12	...blindfolds you, drives you to a dark room, reeking of brimstone, cuts off a hunk of your leg, and then...
10	00:01:12	00:01:14	And he eats it!
11	00:01:14	00:01:19	Right in front of me!
12	00:01:19	00:01:21	Only...
13	00:01:21	00:01:22	What?
14	00:01:22	00:01:26	Now that I think about it...
15	00:01:26	00:01:28	he sounded more like you.
16	00:01:28	00:01:31	Absolutely delectable.
17	00:01:34	00:01:36	Okay, Owen.
18	00:01:36	00:01:37	Thanks for sharing your story.
19	00:01:37	00:01:43	I'm telling you, this city is writhing with flesh-hungry psychopaths.
20	00:01:43	00:01:48	Hardly go to the grocery store anymore without some Dahmer-looking bag boy salivating over me.
21	00:01:48	00:01:52	(cell phone chimes) Well, it's a good thing that you escaped this particular psychopath.
22	00:01:55	00:01:58	You know what? Owen, it's been fun, but that's the morgue calling.
23	00:01:58	00:02:00	We got to go.
24	00:02:00	00:02:03	We'll start a file and we'll keep an eye out.
25	00:02:03	00:02:05	Make sure you go see a doctor.
26	00:02:05	00:02:06	Yeah, have him check your head.
27	00:02:06	00:02:07	Uh, excuse me?
28	00:02:07	00:02:09	Make sure you get in bed.
29	00:02:09	00:02:12	Right. Okay. Yeah...
30	00:02:16	00:02:18	Hey, man, sorry. I heard you were looking for me.
31	00:02:18	00:02:22	I had some lunatic at PD talking about a people-eater.
32	00:02:22	00:02:25	I heard about it, and that's why I asked for you.
33	00:02:25	00:02:30	That story might not be so loony.
34	00:02:30	00:02:31	A worker just called this in.
35	00:02:31	00:02:33	Found it at the garbage dump.
36	00:02:33	00:02:39	These, uh, rectangular wounds exhibit a serration of a steak knife.
37	00:02:39	00:02:41	What are those particles around the wound?
38	00:02:41	00:02:43	Seasoning of salt and sage.
39	00:02:43	00:02:46	Per Hodges's microscope, not my taste buds.
40	00:02:46	00:02:47	I get it.
41	00:02:47	00:02:48	This is a prank, right?
42	00:02:48	00:02:49	This is real.
43	00:02:49	00:02:55	A-A crude dismemberment like this leaves me little doubt that this meat is murder.
44	00:02:55	00:03:04	World-class restaurants, endless buffets-- all those tasty choices, and we've got a cannibal in Las Vegas.
45	00:03:04	00:03:52	[The Who's Who Are You] [rock music] - ♪ Oh-oh-oh ♪ - ♪ Who ♪ Nick pulled prints from the hand, then he went up to the lab to run them.
46	00:03:52	00:03:54	Looky there.
47	00:03:54	00:03:58	Second instar maggots...
48	00:03:58	00:04:00	...on our cannibal's leftovers.
49	00:04:00	00:04:01	What do you think?
50	00:04:01	00:04:03	Two, three days into decomp?
51	00:04:03	00:04:04	About that.
52	00:04:04	00:04:11	Two marks on the bone indicate a serrated knife cut through muscle and tendons, allowing disarticulation.
53	00:04:11	00:04:13	No medical expertise necessary.
54	00:04:13	00:04:17	Well, it's really no different than pulling a drumstick off a raw chicken.
55	00:04:17	00:04:19	A little different, Doc.
56	00:04:19	00:04:22	Nick gave me some photos of the other guy.
57	00:04:22	00:04:24	Owen Linder, right?
58	00:04:24	00:04:26	The dinner who got away.
59	00:04:26	00:04:32	Look at this-- the wound on Mr. Linder's leg exhibits the same distinct blade flaw as these wounds.
60	00:04:35	00:04:38	So, same knife, same assailant maybe.
61	00:04:38	00:04:39	But I heard Owen's story won't help much.
62	00:04:39	00:04:41	He didn't see his attacker.
63	00:04:41	00:04:46	He claims that he was abducted off the street, blindfolded, then driven to some room.
64	00:04:48	00:04:57	The pain of his leg being filleted made him break free and run blindly into the night.
65	00:04:57	00:04:59	So, no idea where he ran from?
66	00:04:59	00:05:02	Mm-mm. By the time the cops showed up, he was completely turned around.
67	00:05:02	00:05:03	Okay, boys.
68	00:05:03	00:05:09	The, uh, print on the hand says Dennis Hagel.
69	00:05:09	00:05:11	Former endoscopic surgery tech.
70	00:05:11	00:05:13	Got fired for stealing meds. Hmm.
71	00:05:13	00:05:15	So, patrol's out there right now looking for the rest of him.
72	00:05:15	00:05:20	I hope they find him alive and otherwise intact.
73	00:05:20	00:05:24	You are a deeply bizarre man.
74	00:05:24	00:05:26	Oh, yeah? Well, you're no walk in the park, you know.
75	00:05:26	00:05:27	Not you.
76	00:05:27	00:05:30	I was talking about Owen Linder.
77	00:05:30	00:05:32	I've been doing some digging on this guy.
78	00:05:32	00:05:33	There's more to his story?
79	00:05:33	00:05:35	A twisted prologue.
80	00:05:35	00:05:40	Owen has been spending some serious time in a very dark corner of the Internet.
81	00:05:40	00:05:42	Vore.
82	00:05:42	00:05:50	Short for vorarephilia-- an erotic, compulsive fixation that involves eating or being eaten by other living things.
83	00:05:50	00:05:53	Cannibalism.
84	00:05:53	00:05:56	Well, that's just one room in the Vore fetish madhouse.
85	00:05:56	00:06:03	Others involve man-eating plants and giant hungry cats and a whole pornucopia of things you don't even want to know about.
86	00:06:03	00:06:05	You're right there.
87	00:06:05	00:06:08	But Owen here is into plain old cannibalism.
88	00:06:08	00:06:10	At least the idea of it.
89	00:06:10	00:06:12	I mean, he is all over these sites.
90	00:06:12	00:06:14	Doing what?
91	00:06:17	00:06:19	talking about his desire to be devoured.
92	00:06:19	00:06:23	Sharing his fantasies of having his flesh chewed up and swallowed.
93	00:06:23	00:06:28	Yeah, but his fantasy became a... a bloody reality.
94	00:06:28	00:06:31	So, what do you think, that he asked for what happened?
95	00:06:31	00:06:35	That he offered himself up to a... a real-life cannibal?
96	00:06:35	00:06:39	I think that Owen and I need to chew the fat.
97	00:06:46	00:06:49	Did I forget to mention this part of the story?
98	00:06:49	00:06:54	I could tell you guys barely believed me about the attack, much less if it looked like I asked for it.
99	00:06:54	00:06:56	So you didn't ask for it?
100	00:06:56	00:06:58	For a guy to help himself to a hunk of my leg?
101	00:06:58	00:07:00	Are you nuts?!
102	00:07:00	00:07:01	It was supposed to be role-playing.
103	00:07:01	00:07:03	I thought I made that very clear to him.
104	00:07:03	00:07:04	Clear to who?
105	00:07:04	00:07:06	Your attacker?
106	00:07:06	00:07:08	Yeah.
107	00:07:08	00:07:10	Who was he? I don't know.
108	00:07:10	00:07:12	Guy responded privately to one of my Web posts.
109	00:07:12	00:07:15	Said he was a pred looking for prey.
110	00:07:15	00:07:16	Went by the name Eater.
111	00:07:16	00:07:18	Wanted to meet up.
112	00:07:18	00:07:21	So you made a... date?
113	00:07:21	00:07:25	Yeah. Eater told me, uh, to wait in front of my house, and he sneaks up.
114	00:07:25	00:07:26	(snaps fingers) Blindfold.
115	00:07:26	00:07:28	Puts me in the car, takes me to his place.
116	00:07:28	00:07:30	You went willingly?
117	00:07:30	00:07:31	Oh, yeah.
118	00:07:31	00:07:33	Yeah, but I figured, you know, we'd...
119	00:07:33	00:07:36	we'd get out the condiments, you know, slather up and...
120	00:07:36	00:07:37	All right. All right.
121	00:07:37	00:07:39	All right. That's enough.
122	00:07:39	00:07:40	Right.
123	00:07:40	00:07:42	So, after he cut you up...
124	00:07:42	00:07:43	Yeah.
125	00:07:43	00:07:44	...everything else you told us...
126	00:07:44	00:07:50	My daring escape and flee to freedom-- all true.
127	00:07:50	00:07:52	I swear. All right.
128	00:07:52	00:07:55	We're gonna need to see all your online correspondence with this Eater.
129	00:07:55	00:07:58	All right, sure, but it won't help you track him.
130	00:07:58	00:08:00	Eater was strictly anonymous.
131	00:08:00	00:08:04	No way he's leaving any digital breadcrumbs behind.
132	00:08:04	00:08:06	Oh, yeah? Yeah.
133	00:08:06	00:08:07	Well, he did leave us this.
134	00:08:07	00:08:09	Part of a meal.
135	00:08:09	00:08:12	Named... Dennis Hagel. You know him?
136	00:08:12	00:08:15	Maybe he frequented the same Vore sites.
137	00:08:15	00:08:18	Maybe he shared the same interests.
138	00:08:18	00:08:20	Vegas local.
139	00:08:20	00:08:22	He worked in endoscopic surgery.
140	00:08:22	00:08:25	Oh.
141	00:08:25	00:08:27	Like when they stick a camera down your throat?
142	00:08:27	00:08:28	Into your belly?
143	00:08:28	00:08:32	Yeah.
144	00:08:32	00:08:35	What is it, Owen?
145	00:08:37	00:08:40	There's something you need to see.
146	00:08:42	00:08:44	Greg just sent over this video.
147	00:08:44	00:08:51	Owen Linder claims it's a snuff film that's been making its way around the online Vore community-- a snuff film like no one's ever seen before.
148	00:08:51	00:08:55	According to Owen, this lady's name is Miss Feed.
149	00:08:55	00:08:58	Hi, out there.
150	00:08:58	00:09:01	It's another... sunny day in Vegas.
151	00:09:01	00:09:03	Want to have some fun?
152	00:09:03	00:09:04	Webcam stripper.
153	00:09:04	00:09:06	No, not really.
154	00:09:06	00:09:11	She offers a unique service to vore-heads like Owen that dream of being gobbled up.
155	00:09:11	00:09:13	You look so yummy.
156	00:09:13	00:09:16	Mmm. And I'm just so hungry.
157	00:09:16	00:09:19	I can't wait...
158	00:09:19	00:09:23	...to devour you.
159	00:09:24	00:09:25	This is new.
160	00:09:30	00:09:31	Endoscopic camera.
161	00:09:31	00:09:34	Possibly manned by our disarmed victim, Dennis Hagel.
162	00:09:34	00:09:38	Can't be too many people with that skill-set involved with this kind of stuff.
163	00:09:38	00:09:39	Yeah.
164	00:09:42	00:09:44	And we've reached her stomach.
165	00:09:44	00:09:46	Lovely.
166	00:09:47	00:09:49	Whoa. What was that?
167	00:09:49	00:09:53	Oh, my God. It's a knife.
168	00:09:53	00:09:54	She's getting stabbed.
169	00:09:54	00:09:58	Let it play.
170	00:10:00	00:10:02	All that blood-- an artery was hit.
171	00:10:02	00:10:04	She's dying.
172	00:10:07	00:10:11	Uh, wh-what does the video's metadata say?
173	00:10:11	00:10:16	Originated three days ago, but it bounced through proxies, obscuring any other information.
174	00:10:16	00:10:20	So, we have a murder victim with no name and no idea where the crime scene is.
175	00:10:20	00:10:23	Video's all we got to work with.
176	00:10:23	00:10:28	Well, if we can stand a closer look, there might be something in here that can help us.
177	00:10:28	00:10:31	Let's split it up. Go frame by frame.
178	00:10:31	00:10:33	Listen, Stephanie, why don't we reschedule.
179	00:10:33	00:10:36	I'm completely jammed up in traffic on the Strip.
180	00:10:36	00:10:37	Okay. Bye.
181	00:10:37	00:10:40	Who you hiding from?
182	00:10:40	00:10:42	Head of my share-free election committee.
183	00:10:42	00:10:45	A smart woman, tons of energy, but...
184	00:10:45	00:10:46	You can't stand her.
185	00:10:46	00:10:49	Well, you're welcome to take refuge in here if you want.
186	00:10:49	00:10:51	I mean...
187	00:10:51	00:10:53	election's over a year away.
188	00:10:53	00:10:58	They're already pressuring me about my image, my platform, soliciting contributions.
189	00:10:58	00:11:01	Getting appointed, I avoided that whole campaign circus.
190	00:11:01	00:11:03	Well, no one's gonna run against you this time.
191	00:11:03	00:11:05	So, your job should be safe, right?
192	00:11:05	00:11:07	Well, that's the other thing.
193	00:11:07	00:11:12	I don't know if I want it.
194	00:11:12	00:11:13	Really?
195	00:11:13	00:11:16	Sometimes I miss the lab.
196	00:11:16	00:11:19	The way you get to work here, it's clean, honest.
197	00:11:19	00:11:20	You don't have to get your hands dirty.
198	00:11:20	00:11:23	Well, for a Vegas sheriff, your hands are pretty clean.
199	00:11:23	00:11:28	Unless you've started planting bodies in the desert like the good old days.
200	00:11:28	00:11:30	Not yet, but I can certainly understand the impulse.
201	00:11:30	00:11:34	Some of the decisions I've had to make in this job, some of the ugliness in this town.
202	00:11:34	00:11:37	We've had a big helping of that today.
203	00:11:37	00:11:40	Yeah.
204	00:11:40	00:11:44	A killer with a taste for human flesh, preying on those who fantasize about it.
205	00:11:44	00:11:45	That's the headline.
206	00:11:45	00:11:48	Well, we better solve it before it hits the news.
207	00:11:48	00:11:51	Came by to see what you got.
208	00:11:51	00:11:58	Got a crazy story from one vic, an arm from another and a snuff film from the third.
209	00:11:58	00:12:00	That's it? No other physical evidence?
210	00:12:00	00:12:02	No.
211	00:12:02	00:12:06	And no reason to think that this maniac is gonna stop.
212	00:12:08	00:12:11	You want to have some fun?
213	00:13:05	00:13:06	Hey.
214	00:13:06	00:13:15	So, it turns out, trying to solve a murder from inside the victim is a hell of a lot trickier than it sounds. The best luck I've had is with the murder weapon.
215	00:13:15	00:13:17	The knife is serrated.
216	00:13:17	00:13:20	Same kind of knife that cut our other two victims.
217	00:13:20	00:13:24	And I noticed an unusual detail in that freeze-frame.
218	00:13:24	00:13:25	Engraved symbol.
219	00:13:25	00:13:27	The Cyrillic name of a Russian village.
220	00:13:27	00:13:29	Marilsk.
221	00:13:29	00:13:32	So, either the killer is from there or just a collector.
222	00:13:32	00:13:36	Either way, we still have no idea who or where Miss Feed is.
223	00:13:36	00:13:44	Actually, we do. As luck should have it, her strange eating habits weren't just limited to her work. I noticed this in my analysis of the stomach video.
224	00:13:44	00:13:48	Jelly donut wrapped around hamburger.
225	00:13:48	00:13:50	There's only one place in town that serves that sandwich.
226	00:13:50	00:13:53	Hangover Grill-- and I'm never going there again.
227	00:13:53	00:13:59	I got the credit card receipts from the day Miss Feed was killed, and I ran them through DMV.
228	00:13:59	00:14:02	Miss Feed is actually Miss Brenda Waring.
229	00:14:02	00:14:06	Her home address is in Henderson.
230	00:14:06	00:14:09	LVPD!
231	00:14:33	00:14:34	Dennis Hagel.
232	00:14:34	00:14:39	Cameraman.
233	00:14:39	00:14:41	We got it.
234	00:14:41	00:14:42	Why don't you get some air.
235	00:14:42	00:14:43	Thank you.
236	00:14:49	00:14:52	Brenda Waring wasn't just killed, she was butchered.
237	00:14:58	00:15:01	Salt and sage.
238	00:15:01	00:15:04	What the hell are we hunting?
239	00:15:54	00:15:58	A door was thrown open, causing this picture to go crooked.
240	00:15:58	00:16:00	Brenda was meticulous, very organized.
241	00:16:00	00:16:03	I don't think she would've let it stay like that for even a minute.
242	00:16:03	00:16:05	Unless she never had a chance to straighten it.
243	00:16:05	00:16:12	We know that moments before she was murdered, Brenda was back there with Dennis doing a cam session.
244	00:16:12	00:16:17	I just can't wait to devour you.
245	00:16:17	00:16:19	Then the killer barged in.
246	00:16:19	00:16:21	Any sign of forced entry? No.
247	00:16:21	00:16:23	Do you know what? She could've left the door unlocked.
248	00:16:23	00:16:25	Nice neighborhood, middle of the day-- why not?
249	00:16:25	00:16:31	All the darkness, all the weirdness was kept in this corner of her world.
250	00:16:31	00:16:33	Till it came storming in.
251	00:16:42	00:16:45	Single, sharp-force wound to the neck.
252	00:16:45	00:16:49	Severed the carotid jugular complex.
253	00:16:49	00:16:50	It looks like the cameraman was just in the way.
254	00:16:50	00:16:52	He was taken out quickly.
255	00:16:52	00:16:55	The target of the killer's rage appears to have been Brenda.
256	00:16:55	00:16:57	Dozen stab wounds centered around her stomach.
257	00:16:57	00:17:00	That's quite a statement, considering her line of work.
258	00:17:00	00:17:02	Assailant had to know her as Miss Feed.
259	00:17:02	00:17:05	Maybe an obsessed or jilted client.
260	00:17:05	00:17:12	After consuming Brenda, the psycho didn't seem to have an appetite for Dennis.
261	00:17:12	00:17:16	Apparently, uh, he bagged Dennis's arm to go.
262	00:17:16	00:17:17	It might not have been all he took.
263	00:17:17	00:17:22	I haven't been able to find a purse anywhere around here.
264	00:17:22	00:17:24	No wallet.
265	00:17:24	00:17:27	A cannibal, a killer...
266	00:17:27	00:17:30	and a thief?
267	00:17:30	00:17:42	In some cannibalistic cultures, it was believed that eating someone's flesh was a way to absorb their strength, their, uh, spiritual essence, their wisdom, their skills.
268	00:17:42	00:17:44	You've studied this?
269	00:17:44	00:17:46	Caribbean cruise when I was 11.
270	00:17:46	00:17:48	I was prepared for any encounters.
271	00:17:48	00:17:54	So, I was thinking, Miss Feed feasted on all of those clients.
272	00:17:54	00:18:02	So, maybe the killer was after her, fed on her because he saw her as a sort of human turducken.
273	00:18:02	00:18:06	All those spirits inside of her...
274	00:18:06	00:18:09	would make for a very powerful meal.
275	00:18:09	00:18:12	But Miss Feed only dealt in simulation.
276	00:18:12	00:18:15	She never actually ingested any flesh.
277	00:18:15	00:18:17	This killer is brunching on people.
278	00:18:17	00:18:19	His logic might be slightly out of whack.
279	00:18:20	00:18:22	He's also out of cash.
280	00:18:22	00:18:25	Just got a hit that someone used Brenda Waring's credit card.
281	00:18:28	00:18:31	Charging up your sister's plastic?
282	00:18:31	00:18:33	That's a strange way of grieving your sister's death, Colleen.
283	00:18:37	00:18:40	Yeah, I stole from Brenda.
284	00:18:40	00:18:41	But that was five days ago.
285	00:18:41	00:18:43	I didn't hurt her.
286	00:18:43	00:18:47	I was in jail until this morning when I used her card.
287	00:18:47	00:18:49	We know that you didn't kill your sister, Colleen.
288	00:18:49	00:18:51	You were locked up at the time of the murder.
289	00:18:51	00:18:53	Meth possession.
290	00:18:53	00:18:57	But maybe you know who did this to Brenda.
291	00:18:57	00:19:00	I told her they would hurt her.
292	00:19:00	00:19:03	Kind of guys who'd ask her to do those things.
293	00:19:03	00:19:05	She's tempting them.
294	00:19:05	00:19:09	And the demons wouldn't stay boxed inside the computer forever.
295	00:19:09	00:19:11	I tried to warn her.
296	00:19:11	00:19:14	All the wicked people out there.
297	00:19:18	00:19:28	So, these, uh, demons you mentioned-- the clients that your sister performed for-- did she ever tell you about any of them?
298	00:19:30	00:19:32	Problems she may have had with them?
299	00:19:32	00:19:35	Last time I saw her was five days ago.
300	00:19:35	00:19:37	And something...
301	00:19:37	00:19:40	somebody had scared her.
302	00:19:40	00:19:44	Brenda, if one of those online pervs said something to you, threatened you...
303	00:19:44	00:19:46	It wasn't one of my clients.
304	00:19:46	00:19:47	It's fine.
305	00:19:47	00:19:49	I don't know why you even deal with these freaks!
306	00:19:49	00:19:50	They need me.
307	00:19:50	00:19:54	These urges that some of them have-- if I can't help them, they could end up hurting themselves.
308	00:19:54	00:19:57	You can understand that, right?
309	00:19:57	00:19:59	And if you came here for money to use, forget it.
310	00:20:01	00:20:05	She wouldn't give me what I wanted, so I took it.
311	00:20:05	00:20:09	I scavenged what I could get from her.
312	00:20:10	00:20:12	And now she's gone.
313	00:20:15	00:20:20	Okay, this is totally none of my business, but did I hear that you asked Nick out?
314	00:20:20	00:20:22	No, I did not ask Nick out.
315	00:20:22	00:20:24	But we do have a work date.
316	00:20:24	00:20:27	We're going to this party.
317	00:20:27	00:20:29	The Feast of the Cannibals?
318	00:20:29	00:20:34	Yeah, I found the invite in Brenda Waring's recovered purse.
319	00:20:34	00:20:40	Join us to indulge your palate for the darkest of delicacies, among the city's most refined aficionados.
320	00:20:40	00:20:42	This can't be real.
321	00:20:42	00:20:47	The address is at a foreclosed-on mansion in Seven Hills, so it's gonna be a party of trespassers.
322	00:20:47	00:20:50	But I think it's a good chance to talk to these vore freaks in the flesh.
323	00:20:50	00:20:54	See if they know anything about the murders at Miss Feed's and the elusive Eater.
324	00:20:54	00:20:56	Fetish is a small community.
325	00:20:56	00:20:58	There's got to be somebody at the party who knows something.
326	00:20:58	00:21:01	Yeah, maybe even our killer cannibal himself will be there.
327	00:21:01	00:21:05	Mm-hmm. Well, don't wear anything too appetizing.
328	00:21:13	00:21:15	Want to check in with our chaperone?
329	00:21:15	00:21:17	Uh, backup, we're approaching the house.
330	00:21:17	00:21:19	Copy?
331	00:21:19	00:21:21	Copy. Standing by.
332	00:22:09	00:22:19	Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to put aside your hors d'oeuvres and your idle chatter, because tonight's entrée is something...
333	00:22:19	00:22:22	far more substantial.
334	00:22:28	00:22:34	I sincerely hope that you all have the stomach for it.
335	00:22:41	00:22:45	419 inside location. Make entry.
336	00:22:45	00:22:48	Quite the feeding frenzy, isn't it?
337	00:22:48	00:22:49	Choice cuts for the newcomers?
338	00:22:54	00:22:55	Gelatin. Hmm.
339	00:22:55	00:22:56	LVPD!
340	00:22:56	00:22:58	Everyone on the floor!
341	00:22:58	00:22:59	Face down!
342	00:23:03	00:23:04	Me too?
343	00:23:16	00:23:21	Oh, it's a warm, fuzzy feeling to know you guys would've been here for me if this was real.
344	00:23:21	00:23:25	The gelatin's not bad-tasting, really.
345	00:23:25	00:23:27	No, no, I'm good.
346	00:23:27	00:23:29	So, you were hired by these people, huh?
347	00:23:29	00:23:32	Hundred bucks to lie there and let them snack on me.
348	00:23:32	00:23:34	Some trippy fetish thing, I guess.
349	00:23:34	00:23:36	C-note's a C-note.
350	00:23:36	00:23:38	Yeah, it is.
351	00:23:38	00:23:42	And that should just about cover your trespassing ticket.
352	00:23:42	00:23:49	I assure you, the feast is a perfectly benign role-playing fantasy among consenting adults.
353	00:23:49	00:23:52	Predators and prey, all pretend.
354	00:23:52	00:23:56	Well, there's someone out there who shares your appetites, but who is definitely not pretending.
355	00:23:56	00:23:58	Do tell.
356	00:23:58	00:24:02	Nothing gets gobbled up faster around here than gossip.
357	00:24:07	00:24:09	That's an interesting cuff link, Mr. Korlov.
358	00:24:09	00:24:11	It's an heirloom.
359	00:24:11	00:24:13	It's the crest of my ancestors' village.
360	00:24:13	00:24:17	It's a bloody family saga worthy of Tolstoy.
361	00:24:17	00:24:20	I could talk your lovely ear off with it.
362	00:24:20	00:24:22	Think I'll keep my ear.
363	00:24:22	00:24:25	Is there someplace more private where we could speak?
364	00:24:29	00:24:32	Brenda.
365	00:24:32	00:24:34	So you knew her-- not just as Miss Feed.
366	00:24:34	00:24:36	What happened?
367	00:24:36	00:24:39	She and her cameraman, Dennis Hagel, were murdered.
368	00:24:39	00:24:40	Butchered.
369	00:24:40	00:24:42	Parts of them were eaten.
370	00:24:42	00:24:43	For real.
371	00:24:43	00:24:47	And the knife...
372	00:24:47	00:24:54	that was used in the slaughter has the same symbol as on your cufflinks, Gary.
373	00:25:00	00:25:08	I know what it is to live in the jaws of a compulsion-- to have one sinister impulse ticking, relentless, through your every fiber.
374	00:25:08	00:25:12	But my impulse is not to feed on flesh.
375	00:25:17	00:25:21	Mr. Korlov...
376	00:25:21	00:25:23	Rather, to be fed upon.
377	00:25:26	00:25:28	Miss Feed...
378	00:25:28	00:25:29	Brenda... was an angel.
379	00:25:29	00:25:33	She was helping me to heal from this.
380	00:25:33	00:25:35	What happened to you?
381	00:25:37	00:25:43	I met this pitch-black soul online, a man named Eater.
382	00:25:43	00:25:50	I brought him offerings-- pieces of my flesh, surgically removed.
383	00:25:50	00:25:54	Eater would dine on my offerings.
384	00:25:54	00:25:58	The arrangement was mutually satisfying.
385	00:25:58	00:26:07	I gave him that antique knife as a gift, to use during our dinners.
386	00:26:07	00:26:08	It was bliss.
387	00:26:08	00:26:17	I knew it would destroy me, piece by piece, so I sought out Brenda.
388	00:26:17	00:26:20	Seeking salvation through her services.
389	00:26:20	00:26:23	So you were one of her clients that she would virtually consume.
390	00:26:23	00:26:25	Yes.
391	00:26:25	00:26:31	And I-I told Eater I'd found a healthier way to... quench my impulses.
392	00:26:31	00:26:33	And how did he take that?
393	00:26:33	00:26:36	Having food ripped from his mouth?
394	00:26:36	00:26:40	Evidently, not well.
395	00:26:40	00:26:42	You were face-to-face with Eater.
396	00:26:42	00:26:46	Did you get a good look at him?
397	00:26:46	00:26:50	Yes. I looked right into his eyes.
398	00:26:52	00:27:01	If you believe him, Gary Korlov said that he was blindfolded on trips to and from Eater's place, but he was permitted to watch Eater dine on his flesh.
399	00:27:01	00:27:02	That's only fair, I guess.
400	00:27:02	00:27:06	Korlov cooperated on a police sketch of Eater.
401	00:27:06	00:27:09	So, we still don't know where this guy's dining room is?
402	00:27:09	00:27:17	That's what we're working on now, starting with the fact that Owen Linder-- our escaped victim-- ended up here...
403	00:27:17	00:27:19	...and he couldn't run too far from Eater's lair.
404	00:27:19	00:27:22	Let's call it a one-mile radius.
405	00:27:22	00:27:23	Korlov recalled certain details of his visits.
406	00:27:23	00:27:29	He said it felt like an industrial space, and he said on one visit, he heard a train that was close enough to disturb the dinner.
407	00:27:29	00:27:32	Rails cut through the north end of that search radius.
408	00:27:32	00:27:35	Well, let's lose the south half.
409	00:27:35	00:27:37	Mm.
410	00:27:37	00:27:39	It is still way too much ground to cover.
411	00:27:39	00:27:40	Factories, warehouses.
412	00:27:40	00:27:43	Mm.
413	00:27:45	00:27:56	You know, Linder had said something in his first interview-- we thought he was just a nut job with a crazy story-- but he said he smelled... brimstone while being attacked.
414	00:27:56	00:27:59	Brimstone? Sulfur.
415	00:27:59	00:28:03	This company here produces organic pesticides.
416	00:28:03	00:28:06	Sulfur is a major component of those.
417	00:28:08	00:28:14	Well, the company may have gone out of business a couple years ago, but the odor of sulfur would have lingered.
418	00:28:14	00:28:17	May not be the only thing hanging around there.
419	00:28:34	00:28:39	Padlock on the door and not a soul around.
420	00:28:39	00:28:41	Perfect place for Eater to feed.
421	00:28:44	00:28:46	Smells like bleach.
422	00:28:50	00:28:52	He cleaned up.
423	00:29:06	00:29:08	He knew we'd be coming.
424	00:29:08	00:29:10	He set the table for us.
425	00:29:10	00:29:15	Murder weapon, napkin left like that-- does it mean he's done?
426	00:29:15	00:29:19	Or just done with the first course.
427	00:29:19	00:29:25	A dead end? Greg and Sara didn't find any prints, DNA?
428	00:29:25	00:29:26	All right.
429	00:29:26	00:29:29	Uh... keep me looped in, D.B.
430	00:29:29	00:29:31	Sorry, Bill.
431	00:29:31	00:29:33	Crime lab.
432	00:29:33	00:29:39	When I was sheriff, that department was three geeks with a microscope I believe they ordered off the back of a comic book.
433	00:29:39	00:29:43	(chuckles) Hard to think the lab ever produced a man fit for the tin star, but you've proven yourself.
434	00:29:43	00:29:45	Well, I appreciate that.
435	00:29:45	00:29:49	Now you're telling me you want to pansy out, retreat from your duty?
436	00:29:49	00:29:50	No, I'll complete my term.
437	00:29:50	00:29:52	I'm just not sure... whether to run again.
438	00:29:52	00:29:54	That's why I wanted to talk to you.
439	00:29:54	00:29:58	I've been doing some thinking... Eh, thinking is crime lab stuff-- sheriff doesn't have to think.
440	00:29:58	00:30:00	Sheriff has a gut tells him what to do.
441	00:30:04	00:30:06	I hear you.
442	00:30:08	00:30:12	Listen, Conrad...
443	00:30:12	00:30:26	I know the job's rough as hell, politics can be bloodier than the crime scenes, and with the... the scrutiny you're under nowadays, you don't even have some of the... release valves sheriffs used to be afforded.
444	00:30:27	00:30:31	you're the sheriff, and you don't answer to anyone.
445	00:30:31	00:30:39	Not your campaign staff or the crime lab or not even your own voice in your own head when it starts doubting you.
446	00:30:39	00:30:42	You're the sheriff, and you make it so the people in this city can sleep at night.
447	00:30:42	00:30:44	That's it.
448	00:30:44	00:30:47	And you're gonna keep doing that.
449	00:30:49	00:30:52	Thanks, Bill.
450	00:30:52	00:30:55	Now, what's this I hear about a killer cannibal?
451	00:30:55	00:30:57	Tell me you got this creep in a cage.
452	00:30:57	00:31:02	I wish I could. All we've got now is a sketch of the suspect.
453	00:31:02	00:31:03	Just released it to the press.
454	00:31:03	00:31:10	That face on the news-- every numbskull in the city is gonna be spinning a Stephen King story for you.
455	00:31:10	00:31:14	You're supposed to be curing nightmares, not causing them.
456	00:31:14	00:31:19	Police are asking anyone with information on the suspect to call their tip line.
457	00:31:19	00:31:23	Sir, you-you believe you saw the suspect?
458	00:31:23	00:31:25	I'm sorry, did you say undead?
459	00:31:25	00:31:29	All this says something about our city's collective imagination.
460	00:31:29	00:31:31	Or maybe their amphetamine use.
461	00:31:31	00:31:35	Listen to me! I'm telling you, I got him! I caught the cannibal!
462	00:31:35	00:31:38	What's going on? I swear to God, I got him cuffed up in the car outside!
463	00:31:38	00:31:40	Somebody help me!
464	00:31:40	00:31:42	Send Stokes out here.
465	00:31:42	00:31:45	Come here.
466	00:31:45	00:31:48	He's right over here.
467	00:31:48	00:31:50	Uh... right here. Right here.
468	00:31:50	00:31:52	He's right, uh...
469	00:31:52	00:31:53	What?
470	00:31:53	00:31:55	No... What...?
471	00:31:55	00:31:57	Give me your light.
472	00:32:11	00:32:14	Our cannibal ate his way out?
473	00:32:50	00:32:53	The hell were you thinking, trying to bring him here yourself?
474	00:32:53	00:32:54	Why didn't you call it in?
475	00:32:54	00:32:56	I saw him, I just reacted. It's my training.
476	00:32:56	00:32:58	Your training?
477	00:32:58	00:33:01	You're an office security guard; you don't apprehend serial killers.
478	00:33:01	00:33:03	Well, apparently, neither do you guys.
479	00:33:03	00:33:08	Take a seat, Todd.
480	00:33:08	00:33:10	Let's just get this all straight.
481	00:33:10	00:33:12	So you saw this guy outside your building...
482	00:33:12	00:33:16	I was at my watch post; and I'd seen the news, the sketch of the suspect.
483	00:33:16	00:33:19	And there he was.
484	00:33:19	00:33:21	Same awful face just passing by outside.
485	00:33:21	00:33:23	So, I grabbed my Taser, I went out there...
486	00:33:23	00:33:24	You zapped him.
487	00:33:24	00:33:27	I tackled him and I cuffed him in my car.
488	00:33:27	00:33:28	Did he say anything when you were driving here?
489	00:33:28	00:33:32	No, he was silent. He was just staring at me.
490	00:33:32	00:33:35	Waiting for his chance.
491	00:33:40	00:33:47	No hits on the prints or DNA from the hand, but with an injury like that, I'm guessing, suspect's not getting very far anyway.
492	00:33:47	00:33:50	That would be true if this were the suspect's hand.
493	00:33:50	00:33:56	What are you talking about? Once the wound was cleaned, the tissue exhibited significant deterioration.
494	00:33:56	00:33:58	That hand was disembodied at least 24 hours ago.
495	00:33:58	00:34:00	Really?
496	00:34:00	00:34:06	And the tool marks on the ligament indicate that a knife was used, not teeth.
497	00:34:06	00:34:09	The security guard is a liar.
498	00:34:09	00:34:11	You know why we're in here, Todd?
499	00:34:11	00:34:15	'Cause the only real thing about your story is a severed human hand.
500	00:34:15	00:34:17	Whose hand is it? I don't know.
501	00:34:17	00:34:19	You killed somebody.
502	00:34:19	00:34:22	You took their hand to fake a story, to make yourself look like a hero.
503	00:34:22	00:34:25	No! I didn't hurt anyone.
504	00:34:27	00:34:29	He gave it to me.
505	00:34:29	00:34:30	Who gave it to you?
506	00:34:30	00:34:33	Him.
507	00:34:33	00:34:34	The cannibal.
508	00:34:34	00:34:36	Enough. Listen to me, you twisted little...
509	00:34:36	00:34:37	I'm not lying!
510	00:34:37	00:34:40	He approached me one night when I was at work alone.
511	00:34:40	00:34:44	I don't know why he chose me, but he did.
512	00:34:44	00:34:46	He knew the names of my little niece and nephew.
513	00:34:46	00:34:48	He had pictures.
514	00:34:48	00:34:53	He said that if I didn't do this for him, that he was gonna...
515	00:34:55	00:35:01	He gave me the hand and a bottle of blood, and he told me what he wanted it to look like.
516	00:35:10	00:35:13	I was just supposed to drive here and say that I'd caught the cannibal.
517	00:35:13	00:35:14	Give it a rest.
518	00:35:14	00:35:18	You can understand, this is all a little bit hard to believe.
519	00:35:18	00:35:22	I'm a good person.
520	00:35:22	00:35:27	I-I never would've thought that I'd cooperate with a monster like that.
521	00:35:27	00:35:32	And it wasn't even the threat-- my niece and nephew.
522	00:35:33	00:35:35	There was something about this guy.
523	00:35:35	00:35:38	When he was near me, there was this...
524	00:35:38	00:35:41	this power...
525	00:35:41	00:35:44	buzzing off of him.
526	00:35:44	00:35:48	He could get you to do whatever he wanted.
527	00:35:48	00:35:54	Like you were face-to-face with the Devil himself.
528	00:35:57	00:35:58	(gasping) Todd? Todd!
529	00:35:58	00:36:00	Hey, Dad, this is for real.
530	00:36:00	00:36:02	Todd?
531	00:36:02	00:36:04	Todd? Okay, okay, turn your head.
532	00:36:04	00:36:06	He's seizing. Keep your tongue...
533	00:36:06	00:36:07	Get medical!
534	00:36:18	00:36:19	Any word?
535	00:36:19	00:36:22	Todd Burris is dead. Cyanide poisoning.
536	00:36:22	00:36:26	Hospital ran tox and gave us his possessions and clothing.
537	00:36:26	00:36:27	Maybe he dosed himself.
538	00:36:27	00:36:29	Could've snuck a pill into PD.
539	00:36:29	00:36:34	Once his story started unraveling, he knew he was gonna get arrested, humiliated.
540	00:36:34	00:36:36	Didn't want to face it.
541	00:36:36	00:36:38	Or the matter of where exactly he got that human hand.
542	00:36:41	00:36:43	What if there's some truth to Todd's story?
543	00:36:43	00:36:47	He spent his dying words telling it.
544	00:36:47	00:36:50	Okay, I suppose last words deserve a chance.
545	00:36:50	00:36:56	So, according to Todd, the cannibal forced him to stage the bloody scene in the car.
546	00:36:56	00:36:57	But why would he do that?
547	00:36:57	00:36:59	I mean, just to mess with the cops?
548	00:36:59	00:37:03	Maybe to fuel the fire of his own myth.
549	00:37:03	00:37:07	You know, the tale of the killer cannibal who eats through his own wrist to escape.
550	00:37:07	00:37:10	That's boogeyman-level stuff.
551	00:37:10	00:37:11	Lives on in urban legend.
552	00:37:11	00:37:22	So, Eater uses Todd to spread his tale, then somehow magically doses him with cyanide to take him out.
553	00:37:22	00:37:26	Or Todd was just another attention hound with a vivid imagination.
554	00:37:31	00:37:34	He didn't imagine it.
555	00:37:34	00:37:37	This watch belonged to Dennis Hagel, our slain cameraman.
556	00:37:37	00:37:39	And this fabric...
557	00:37:39	00:37:41	Ripped from Brenda Waring's lingerie.
558	00:37:41	00:37:42	Tokens from our victims.
559	00:37:42	00:37:44	Why?
560	00:37:44	00:37:48	Maybe Eater's trying to send a message that he's real.
561	00:37:49	00:37:59	There is another possibility how Todd could have these items and why he would use his last dying words to spread the myth of Eater.
562	00:37:59	00:38:02	There was this...
563	00:38:02	00:38:05	power buzzing off of him.
564	00:38:05	00:38:09	To paint an image, more than just a killer, but as something supernatural.
565	00:38:09	00:38:13	Like you were face-to-face with the Devil himself.
566	00:38:13	00:38:16	What if the myth he was spreading was his own?
567	00:38:16	00:38:19	Todd Burris was Eater.
568	00:38:19	00:38:22	Did these horrific acts, took tokens from his victims.
569	00:38:22	00:38:26	All because he wanted to create his own legend.
570	00:38:26	00:38:29	To live on, not just as some no-name rent-a-cop...
571	00:38:29	00:38:32	But as the nightmare that devoured and disappeared.
572	00:38:37	00:38:44	Mr. Korlov, the man you knew as Eater, with whom you had those meals...
573	00:38:44	00:38:46	...is this him?
574	00:38:53	00:38:55	This is just flesh.
575	00:38:55	00:38:59	You can't tell the true essence of a man just by looking at his flesh.
576	00:38:59	00:39:01	I asked you a question.
577	00:39:01	00:39:04	And I would appreciate an answer.
578	00:39:04	00:39:10	The being that I dealt with looked just like I described to you and your sketch artist.
579	00:39:10	00:39:14	A gaunt, glinty-eyed Lucifer himself.
580	00:39:14	00:39:17	Are you sure you want to stick with that story?
581	00:39:17	00:39:21	Because when we find out that you're lying, there will be consequences.
582	00:39:24	00:39:27	I'm going to ask you one more time.
583	00:39:27	00:39:31	Is this the man you knew as Eater?
584	00:39:34	00:39:37	A force like Eater will never be captured like this.
585	00:39:37	00:39:40	That's the horror story they want us to believe.
586	00:39:40	00:39:44	Todd Burris and Gary Korlov were in this together.
587	00:39:44	00:39:46	A murderer and his PR man.
588	00:39:46	00:39:49	You know, we don't know that for sure.
589	00:39:50	00:39:55	Autopsy on Burris didn't find any human tissue in his stomach contents.
590	00:39:55	00:39:58	D.B., the last victim was attacked two days ago.
591	00:39:58	00:39:59	Evidence was already digested.
592	00:39:59	00:40:03	And search of Burris's home didn't find trace from any of the victims.
593	00:40:03	00:40:05	So he was careful. What's your point?
594	00:40:05	00:40:07	What do you mean, what's my point?
595	00:40:07	00:40:09	My point is Eater could still be out there.
596	00:40:09	00:40:11	He never existed. Eater is a myth.
597	00:40:11	00:40:13	Todd Burris was the cannibal.
598	00:40:13	00:40:19	I understand that that's the most likely explanation, Conrad, but until we find physical evidence...
599	00:40:19	00:40:23	D.B., the press release already went out.
600	00:40:23	00:40:27	Why would you do that? What if we're wrong?
601	00:40:27	00:40:30	Look, I get it, all right? I've been in your shoes.
602	00:40:30	00:40:35	World looks different when you're sitting behind a microscope, tweezing for any split hair of doubt... That's the job!
603	00:40:35	00:40:39	Well, my job now is to make the people in this city feel safe.
604	00:40:39	00:40:47	All right? Not the ones dabbling in some deviant corner, but the rest, who are living their lives, going to work, supporting their families.
605	00:40:47	00:40:50	Sounds like you've decided to run after all.
606	00:40:53	00:40:55	Case is closed.
607	00:40:57	00:41:05	Police have identified the man responsible for the grisly crimes as Todd Burris, a Las Vegas security guard who is now deceased.
608	00:41:05	00:41:06	Here you go.
609	00:41:06	00:41:07	Thank you. You're welcome.
610	00:41:07	00:41:10	Been a long one.
611	00:41:10	00:41:11	That's fine. Thanks.
612	00:41:11	00:41:19	...Sheriff Conrad Ecklie thanked the city's residents for their help in apprehending the perpetrator and bringing him to justice.
613	00:41:25	00:41:27	Oh, sorry, sorry.
