0,00:00:02,00:00:05,(wolf howls)
1,00:00:05,00:00:06,(eerie moaning)
2,00:00:06,00:00:07,(evil laughter)
3,00:00:07,00:00:10,"MAN: What's up, man?"
4,00:00:10,00:00:13,"Shut your mouth and act like you got some sense, girl!"
5,00:00:14,00:00:16,Are you sure you have the right address?
6,00:00:16,00:00:18,It's 1027 Washington Street.
7,00:00:18,00:00:19,(cackling in distance)
8,00:00:19,00:00:22,I don't even see any numbers.
9,00:00:22,00:00:24,"Well, it's got to be just..."
10,00:00:24,00:00:25,up there.
11,00:00:25,00:00:28,You better shut your mouth!
12,00:00:32,00:00:35,That guy has a gun. It's...
13,00:00:35,00:00:36,probably just part of his costume.
14,00:00:38,00:00:39,MAN: Yo.
15,00:00:39,00:00:40,"Cheerleader. Yeah, you."
16,00:00:40,00:00:41,Okay.
17,00:00:41,00:00:43,Forget the party.
18,00:00:43,00:00:44,Let's get a cab and go home.
19,00:00:44,00:00:46,MAN: Want to party with us?
20,00:00:46,00:00:48,(man laughing)
21,00:00:48,00:00:50,(gasps) What is that?
22,00:00:50,00:00:53,"(growling, slobbering)"
23,00:00:57,00:00:59,(snarling)
24,00:00:59,00:01:00,(barking)
25,00:01:00,00:01:01,(screaming)
26,00:01:04,00:01:06,(barking)
27,00:01:07,00:01:08,MAN: Come!
28,00:01:08,00:01:10,STOKES: Hey.
29,00:01:10,00:01:14,"What's going on? Well, the dog's freaking out. Won't let us near the body."
30,00:01:14,00:01:16,It's like he's... guarding his kill.
31,00:01:17,00:01:18,STOKES: Who called it in?
32,00:01:18,00:01:19,BRASS: Tinker Bell and the cheerleader.
33,00:01:19,00:01:23,"They got lost on the way to a party. At first, they thought the body was a fake."
34,00:01:23,00:01:24,Happy Halloween.
35,00:01:24,00:01:28,STOKES: Looks like the dog went for his throat. Yeah.
36,00:01:28,00:01:30,BRASS: Animal instinct.
37,00:01:30,00:01:33,"Well, his throat is completely ripped open."
38,00:01:33,00:01:34,Must've bled out.
39,00:01:34,00:01:35,STOKES: Any I.D.?
40,00:01:35,00:01:37,Yeah.
41,00:01:37,00:01:39,Smith &amp; Wesson.
42,00:01:39,00:01:40,"Okay, well..."
43,00:01:42,00:01:44,Gun hasn't been fired.
44,00:01:44,00:01:45,And a wallet.
45,00:01:45,00:01:47,(dog barking)
46,00:01:48,00:01:49,STOKES: He's a cop.
47,00:01:49,00:01:55,"K-9 Unit, Officer Mike Nelson. So you think that's his dog?"
48,00:01:55,00:01:56,So much for man's best friend.
49,00:01:56,00:01:58,Found something else.
50,00:01:58,00:02:00,Want to give me some light there? Okay.
51,00:02:03,00:02:05,"Oh, man."
52,00:02:05,00:02:08,"Well, it looks like methamphetamines, Jim."
53,00:02:08,00:02:11,So we got a cop out of uniform in a skanky part of town with a bag of ice.
54,00:02:11,00:02:15,Something stinks here and I don't think it's the dog.
55,00:02:51,00:02:54,"(barking, snarling)"
56,00:03:00,00:03:05,"STOKES: CSI Russell, Sergeant Varanski, chief trainer with the K-9 unit."
57,00:03:05,00:03:07,Sorry about Officer Nelson.
58,00:03:08,00:03:11,Is that dog always that aggressive?
59,00:03:11,00:03:12,Sam? No.
60,00:03:12,00:03:15,He and Mike were partners for eight years.
61,00:03:15,00:03:16,Best team in the department.
62,00:03:16,00:03:18,STOKES: Officer Nelson was out of uniform.
63,00:03:18,00:03:19,Was he working undercover?
64,00:03:19,00:03:20,No.
65,00:03:20,00:03:21,He was off duty last night.
66,00:03:21,00:03:25,"If he was off duty, what was he doing in the alphabets with a bag full of meth?"
67,00:03:25,00:03:27,Mike was a good cop.
68,00:03:27,00:03:29,They both were.
69,00:03:29,00:03:31,"These dogs are trained to attack, am I right?"
70,00:03:31,00:03:37,"They only bite to hold a suspect or to defend themselves. We're talking about more than just a bite here, Sergeant."
71,00:03:37,00:03:39,Nelson's throat was ripped open.
72,00:03:39,00:03:43,Can you think of anything that would set that dog off?
73,00:03:43,00:03:45,He could be sick.
74,00:03:45,00:03:47,That would make any dog lash out.
75,00:03:47,00:03:50,"And he could've gotten into Nelson's stash. I mean, look at him. (growls)"
76,00:03:52,00:03:55,"I'll take him into custody, get him checked out by the vet. No, no."
77,00:03:55,00:03:57,"No, we have to process him first."
78,00:03:57,00:03:58,He's got evidence all over him.
79,00:03:58,00:04:01,"STOKES: Yeah, when we're done I'll make sure he gets to you, okay?"
80,00:04:01,00:04:02,Thank you very much.
81,00:04:02,00:04:04,Appreciate that.
82,00:04:04,00:04:05,"(barking, snarling)"
83,00:04:28,00:04:30,STOKES: Hey.
84,00:04:30,00:04:33,Brass found Nelson's truck about a block from the crime scene.
85,00:04:33,00:04:34,Had it towed in.
86,00:04:34,00:04:37,Find anything? Yeah.
87,00:04:37,00:04:40,"A piece of the dog's nail, and some dried blood on the window."
88,00:04:40,00:04:42,Dog clawed his way out.
89,00:04:42,00:04:43,(barking)
90,00:04:50,00:04:55,"So, if Nelson was off duty, buying drugs, why bring the dog?"
91,00:04:55,00:04:57,Sergeant told me that the dog lived with Nelson.
92,00:04:57,00:04:59,Went everywhere with him.
93,00:04:59,00:05:01,So... for protection?
94,00:05:01,00:05:03,"Well, if that's the case, why would you leave the dog in the truck?"
95,00:05:03,00:05:05,Maybe that's what he was trying to protect.
96,00:05:05,00:05:10,"In a neighborhood like that, you leave your truck, you never know if it's gonna be there when you get back, especially on Halloween."
97,00:05:21,00:05:22,Department-issued envelope...
98,00:05:28,00:05:29,...full of cash.
99,00:05:31,00:05:32,Huh.
100,00:05:32,00:05:35,Must be at least five grand here.
101,00:05:35,00:05:37,Could've been stolen from Evidence.
102,00:05:37,00:05:44,"Could be this dog wasn't just going after his partner, he was going after a dirty cop."
103,00:05:51,00:05:52,Meet Barry Sloan.
104,00:05:52,00:05:54,Big-shot lawyer.
105,00:05:54,00:05:55,Lived alone.
106,00:05:55,00:05:57,But I bet he wasn't lonely.
107,00:05:57,00:06:01,This place reeks of money.
108,00:06:01,00:06:05,"Professionally decorated, impeccably clean..."
109,00:06:05,00:06:07,all to impress the ladies.
110,00:06:07,00:06:09,"Yeah, I've spent some time in bedrooms like this. (chuckles)"
111,00:06:09,00:06:11,Thought you were into cops.
112,00:06:11,00:06:13,"I do marry cops, but..."
113,00:06:13,00:06:15,I've dated some lawyers.
114,00:06:15,00:06:16,They're fun to argue with.
115,00:06:16,00:06:18,Hm.
116,00:06:18,00:06:20,"Boy, they can be sleazy sometimes, though."
117,00:06:20,00:06:27,"Apparently, you're not the only one who thinks so. Police responded to a 911 call, shots fired."
118,00:06:27,00:06:32,"When they got here, the shower was still running, but Mr. Sloan is bone-dry."
119,00:06:32,00:06:35,GSW to the chest.
120,00:06:39,00:06:44,"Blood is confined to this area, which means he must've been on the bed or nearby when he was shot."
121,00:06:45,00:06:48,Shooter missed at least once.
122,00:06:48,00:06:51,Found a bullet hole in the wall there.
123,00:06:51,00:06:54,"Based on the trajectory, looks like it came from that direction."
124,00:06:59,00:07:01,(camera shutter clicking)
125,00:07:03,00:07:08,Radial cracks indicate that the force must've originated from the outside.
126,00:07:11,00:07:12,(gunshot)
127,00:07:16,00:07:18,Means our shooter was on the outside of the window.
128,00:07:18,00:07:19,Who called it in?
129,00:07:21,00:07:24,(indistinct police radio communication)
130,00:07:24,00:07:27,(indistinct chatter)
131,00:07:27,00:07:28,Mrs. Young?
132,00:07:28,00:07:29,Ms. Ms.
133,00:07:29,00:07:31,I got tired of being a housewife.
134,00:07:31,00:07:33,"Dumped the husband, kept the last name."
135,00:07:33,00:07:35,"And his Jag. Oh, lucky you."
136,00:07:35,00:07:38,I had to pay mine alimony.
137,00:07:38,00:07:40,"FINLAY: So, what exactly did you hear?"
138,00:07:40,00:07:43,"Well, I get up early every morning to do my meditation."
139,00:07:43,00:07:48,"I had just reached an elevated state of consciousness when I heard: bang, bang!"
140,00:07:48,00:07:50,So two gunshots in all. Yeah.
141,00:07:50,00:07:51,And what time was that?
142,00:07:51,00:07:53,I looked at the clock. It was 6:05.
143,00:07:53,00:07:55,And did you see anything?
144,00:07:55,00:07:57,Anyone? Nothing.
145,00:07:57,00:08:00,But then I had this really bad feeling it had something to do with Barry.
146,00:08:00,00:08:03,Why do you think it had something to do with Barry?
147,00:08:03,00:08:05,Mm. A lot of people hated him.
148,00:08:05,00:08:06,He was a real shark.
149,00:08:06,00:08:07,Divorce lawyer.
150,00:08:07,00:08:12,I've known quite a few of those. One time a brick came flying through my window with a note attached.
151,00:08:12,00:08:16,"It said, ""Burn in hell, you scumbag lawyer."" Meant for Barry but..."
152,00:08:16,00:08:21,"they got my house by mistake. So, I guess Mr. Sloan was not very popular in the neighborhood."
153,00:08:21,00:08:23,"Listen, I feel bad about what happened to Barry, but..."
154,00:08:23,00:08:26,"you ask me, our property values just went up."
155,00:08:26,00:08:29,That's a horrible thing to say.
156,00:08:29,00:08:31,The poor man just died.
157,00:08:33,00:08:36,And how exactly do you know Mr. Sloan?
158,00:08:36,00:08:40,"Oh, um, we've been neighbors for 13 years."
159,00:08:40,00:08:43,"Oh, uh, Marjorie Randall."
160,00:08:43,00:08:48,"Look, when I had my hip replacement, Barry brought in my mail every day."
161,00:08:48,00:08:50,So you two were good friends?
162,00:08:50,00:08:51,"Oh, yes."
163,00:08:51,00:08:53,Did he ever discuss his work with you?
164,00:08:53,00:08:55,"Oh, he talked about it all the time."
165,00:08:55,00:08:57,He loved his job.
166,00:08:57,00:09:02,Especially when he won a case. Do you know if he was in the middle of a particularly messy one?
167,00:09:02,00:09:05,Barry just always said that all divorces were messy.
168,00:09:07,00:09:11,Do you think that that could've had something to do with his death?
169,00:09:11,00:09:13,We will do everything we can to find out.
170,00:09:15,00:09:16,(barking)
171,00:09:22,00:09:24,How you doing with Cujo?
172,00:09:28,00:09:29,I don't know.
173,00:09:29,00:09:31,He's still pretty riled up.
174,00:09:31,00:09:32,"Well, why don't you wait for Varanski?"
175,00:09:32,00:09:33,He's on his way back.
176,00:09:33,00:09:34,He'll help you muzzle the dog.
177,00:09:34,00:09:38,"Then you can get your evidence. By the time he gets here, all the evidence is gonna be gone. Look at him."
178,00:09:38,00:09:41,Look at him. He's licking it all away.
179,00:09:41,00:09:45,"Hey, if you're thinking about opening up that cage, we're gonna have another crime scene."
180,00:09:45,00:09:48,"(sighs) Maybe he's just threatened by me, you know?"
181,00:09:48,00:09:51,"I mean, he's in there, he's cornered, I'm coming at him with sticks."
182,00:09:51,00:09:53,"Open the gate, maybe he'll calm down."
183,00:09:53,00:09:55,"Nick... Hey, come on. Don't worry."
184,00:09:55,00:09:57,I had a bunch of dogs growing up-- know what I'm doing.
185,00:09:57,00:09:59,(phone rings)
186,00:09:59,00:10:01,"All right, look, I got Doc Robbins."
187,00:10:01,00:10:04,"Nick, that dog killed somebody."
188,00:10:05,00:10:08,Wait for Varanski. Please.
189,00:10:08,00:10:10,(dog growling)
190,00:10:23,00:10:24,(growling)
191,00:10:24,00:10:27,(barking)
192,00:10:27,00:10:29,"Well, boy..."
193,00:10:31,00:10:33,(sighs)
194,00:10:33,00:10:35,"(barks, growls)"
195,00:10:35,00:10:38,I'm not gonna let you destroy all my evidence.
196,00:10:38,00:10:43,"(growls) I'm gonna process you, just like any other suspect, whether you like it or not."
197,00:10:43,00:10:45,So...
198,00:10:45,00:10:47,here's how it's gonna go down.
199,00:10:47,00:10:54,"I'm gonna let you out of this crate, and when I do, you're gonna be cool... and I'm gonna be cool."
200,00:10:54,00:10:56,(low bark)
201,00:10:56,00:10:57,Okay?
202,00:10:57,00:10:59,(low growl)
203,00:11:03,00:11:04,(low growl)
204,00:11:04,00:11:06,Easy.
205,00:11:07,00:11:09,(low growl) Easy...
206,00:11:14,00:11:16,"Easy, now."
207,00:11:16,00:11:18,(low groan)
208,00:11:21,00:11:22,(low growl)
209,00:11:24,00:11:26,(low growl)
210,00:11:27,00:11:29,"(growls, barks)"
211,00:11:31,00:11:32,"(grunts, snarls)"
212,00:11:32,00:11:34,(barking)
213,00:11:34,00:11:35,(growling)
214,00:11:35,00:11:37,How about one of these?
215,00:11:37,00:11:38,Huh?
216,00:11:38,00:11:40,Want a little treat?
217,00:11:40,00:11:42,"Cooperate, now, okay?"
218,00:11:42,00:11:43,(barks)
219,00:11:46,00:11:47,Right in here.
220,00:11:47,00:11:50,Cooperate.
221,00:11:52,00:11:53,"Right in here, bud."
222,00:11:53,00:11:55,Easy.
223,00:11:55,00:11:56,(whines)
224,00:12:00,00:12:02,Easy.
225,00:12:02,00:12:04,You got something in your teeth there.
226,00:12:06,00:12:08,Easy.
227,00:12:08,00:12:10,I'm not gonna hurt you. (low growl)
228,00:12:12,00:12:16,"Well, it looks like you got your pound of flesh, eh?"
229,00:12:22,00:12:25,"ROBBINS: When the kids were little, I bought them a dog."
230,00:12:25,00:12:26,A mutt from the shelter.
231,00:12:26,00:12:31,He slept on my daughter's bed every night-- part of the family.
232,00:12:31,00:12:33,"Yeah, it's easy to forget they're still animals."
233,00:12:33,00:12:35,ROBBINS: It's hard to make out the teeth marks.
234,00:12:35,00:12:37,May have to call in an odontologist.
235,00:12:37,00:12:48,"Well, maybe the saliva will give us the dog's DNA. You said our victim had drugs on him-- I don't see any needle marks. Could be a new user."
236,00:12:48,00:12:50,Maybe the drugs haven't taken their toll yet.
237,00:12:50,00:12:53,I'll send blood and hair over to Tox.
238,00:12:53,00:12:55,"Multiple cuts and bruises, defensive wounds."
239,00:12:55,00:12:58,"Boy, this guy put up quite a fight."
240,00:12:58,00:13:00,Why didn't he pull his gun?
241,00:13:00,00:13:02,I think I know why.
242,00:13:02,00:13:07,"When the dog attacked Nelson, he must have knocked him over."
243,00:13:07,00:13:08,(barking)
244,00:13:08,00:13:14,"(bone cracks) The angle of the fall broke Nelson's arm in two places, rendering the arm useless."
245,00:13:14,00:13:16,"Well, that explains why he didn't shoot the dog."
246,00:13:16,00:13:19,One mystery solved.
247,00:14:04,00:14:07,Hey. Hit the jackpot.
248,00:14:07,00:14:09,Yeah? .38 Special.
249,00:14:09,00:14:12,Just like the slug we took out of the wall.
250,00:14:12,00:14:16,That's not all I found: fingerprints on the windowsill. Killer saw quite a show.
251,00:14:16,00:14:21,"I found semen stains. No way a guy like Sloan wouldn't wash his sheets, so they're fresh."
252,00:14:23,00:14:24,And he wasn't alone.
253,00:14:24,00:14:25,Lipstick? Mm-hmm.
254,00:14:25,00:14:29,Maybe Mr. Sloan was sleeping with someone's wife.
255,00:14:29,00:14:30,Or girlfriend. Yeah.
256,00:14:30,00:14:33,"His job didn't get him killed, his penis did."
257,00:14:41,00:14:42,You're back from the vet?
258,00:14:42,00:14:44,"Yeah. Yeah, they did a full workup."
259,00:14:44,00:14:45,The dog's healthy as an ox.
260,00:14:45,00:14:47,"And his tox came back clean, too."
261,00:14:47,00:14:50,"But if there's behavioral issues, there's not much they can do."
262,00:14:50,00:14:53,"Well, I guess that makes him a dead dog walking."
263,00:14:53,00:14:55,"Yeah, unfortunately."
264,00:14:55,00:14:58,"Well, his tox wasn't the only one that came back clean."
265,00:14:58,00:15:00,"No drugs in Officer Nelson's system, either."
266,00:15:00,00:15:08,"Hair analysis proves that he wasn't a regular user. If he wasn't buying drugs in that part of town, then what was he doing with all that cash in his truck? I don't know."
267,00:15:08,00:15:12,But I can tell you that he didn't steal it from evidence.
268,00:15:12,00:15:13,Money came from his personal bank account.
269,00:15:13,00:15:17,He made a series of large withdrawals within the last six months.
270,00:15:17,00:15:19,"Well, he was into something."
271,00:15:19,00:15:21,ANDREWS: Where's the dog?
272,00:15:21,00:15:23,Animal Control. ANDREWS: What?
273,00:15:23,00:15:25,"No, they're gonna put him down-- you have to stop them."
274,00:15:25,00:15:28,Why? What's going on? The dog is innocent. He didn't kill his partner.
275,00:15:28,00:15:30,"The saliva on Nelson's throat, it isn't canine; it was human."
276,00:15:36,00:15:40,(dog snarling) BRASS: Start of the zombie apocalypse.
277,00:15:40,00:15:46,"You know, we had a case where a cheerleader, high on PCP, ate another cheerleader's stomach."
278,00:15:46,00:15:48,Nelson's killer was high on something.
279,00:15:48,00:15:50,"Why was Nelson in a Cracktown, anyway?"
280,00:15:50,00:15:57,"He could've been setting someone up, you know, planting evidence to catch a bigger fish, things go south, he gets killed, I don't know."
281,00:15:57,00:16:00,But not before his partner took a piece out of the killer.
282,00:16:00,00:16:03,That flesh from the dog's teeth came back to...
283,00:16:03,00:16:05,an unknown male.
284,00:16:05,00:16:07,(panting)
285,00:16:07,00:16:08,(Sam whines)
286,00:16:10,00:16:12,I guess Nick sprung him from Animal Control.
287,00:16:12,00:16:14,"Ah, there he is. Sam."
288,00:16:14,00:16:15,"Hey, wha...?"
289,00:16:15,00:16:17,"Sorry, he just got away from me."
290,00:16:17,00:16:18,I can't have him walking around CSI.
291,00:16:18,00:16:20,I know. Come on.
292,00:16:20,00:16:22,"STOKES: Sam, come on. Come. Hey."
293,00:16:22,00:16:25,"S... Boy, you have a way with dogs, Stokes."
294,00:16:25,00:16:27,"Hey, this pain in the ass may help us find Nelson's killer."
295,00:16:27,00:16:29,"I mean, he is our only witness."
296,00:16:29,00:16:31,"Aw, no, hey, come on, that's my anniversary gift!"
297,00:16:31,00:16:33,"Drop it, Sam. RUSSELL: That is hand-carved."
298,00:16:33,00:16:34,One of a kind.
299,00:16:34,00:16:36,(whispers): Drop it!
300,00:16:36,00:16:37,(low growl)
301,00:16:37,00:16:41,"BRASS: I know he's a highly trained police dog, but how the hell is he gonna help with the case?"
302,00:16:41,00:16:43,He won't even drop an anniversary gift.
303,00:16:43,00:16:45,(Sam whines)
304,00:16:45,00:16:46,(barking)
305,00:16:46,00:16:48,(growling)
306,00:16:50,00:16:52,(gunfire)
307,00:16:52,00:16:55,Sergeant Varanski.
308,00:16:55,00:16:57,"(dogs barking) Hey, Nick."
309,00:16:57,00:16:59,"Hey, man, how's it going?"
310,00:16:59,00:17:01,Good to see you. Good to see you.
311,00:17:01,00:17:03,Thanks for clearing his name; you really saved his life.
312,00:17:03,00:17:04,(Sam whining) What you got there?
313,00:17:04,00:17:06,"Huh? What you got, boy? (low growl)"
314,00:17:06,00:17:11,"Say, if it's all right with you, we'd like to hang on to him for a while, see if he can help us track down Officer Nelson's killer."
315,00:17:11,00:17:13,"Sure. If anyone can, it's Sam."
316,00:17:13,00:17:16,"Best nose in the department. There is one problem, though."
317,00:17:16,00:17:18,I can't get him to do anything.
318,00:17:18,00:17:20,He won't even drop that stupid totem pole.
319,00:17:20,00:17:21,Maybe you're not speaking his language. No?
320,00:17:21,00:17:24,"What's that, ""dog""? I could try barking or something."
321,00:17:24,00:17:27,French. Sammy was born just outside of Paris.
322,00:17:27,00:17:29,All the dogs come to us fully trained.
323,00:17:29,00:17:30,Laisser tomber!
324,00:17:32,00:17:33,(whines)
325,00:17:33,00:17:35,There you go.
326,00:17:35,00:17:37,"Go ahead, take his leash off. Okay."
327,00:17:37,00:17:39,(barks)
328,00:17:39,00:17:40,Venez!
329,00:17:53,00:17:55,Asseyez-vous.
330,00:17:59,00:18:01,Fini.
331,00:18:06,00:18:09,Guess I better brush up on my French.
332,00:18:12,00:18:15,"Well, that and, uh..."
333,00:18:15,00:18:17,earn his respect.
334,00:18:19,00:18:21,(quietly): Right.
335,00:18:23,00:18:24,Hey. Hey.
336,00:18:24,00:18:28,So you know those... fingerprints I collected outside the vic's windowsill?
337,00:18:28,00:18:29,Yeah. Got a hit in AFIS.
338,00:18:29,00:18:31,Brent Walsh.
339,00:18:31,00:18:33,A casino worker in the middle of a divorce.
340,00:18:33,00:18:35,And Mr. Sloan was his lawyer.
341,00:18:35,00:18:42,"MAN: That arrogant, despicable piece of crap. I take it you weren't satisfied with his services. I'll say."
342,00:18:42,00:18:44,He was too busy satisfying my wife.
343,00:18:44,00:18:51,"They were sleeping together? Sloan is supposed to protect my assets, not hand everything over to that bitch."
344,00:18:51,00:18:53,That's when I got suspicious.
345,00:18:53,00:18:55,So you went to Sloan's house last night.
346,00:18:55,00:18:59,Yeah. I snuck in the side yard and I peeked in the bedroom window.
347,00:18:59,00:19:04,That's when I saw that scumbag sleeping with the enemy.
348,00:19:04,00:19:06,(moaning)
349,00:19:09,00:19:12,"BRODY: And then you waited for your ex-wife to leave, and you shot Sloan."
350,00:19:12,00:19:16,WALSH: No. I don't even own a gun.
351,00:19:16,00:19:18,I didn't want Sloan... dead.
352,00:19:18,00:19:21,"I wanted him... disbarred, unemployed, homeless."
353,00:19:21,00:19:23,But you were there.
354,00:19:23,00:19:24,You had motive.
355,00:19:24,00:19:27,"I peeked in the window, and then I left."
356,00:19:27,00:19:29,Where'd you go? I went to work.
357,00:19:29,00:19:30,"I'm a blackjack dealer at the Tangiers, graveyard shift."
358,00:19:30,00:19:33,I checked in at midnight and finished my shift at 8:00.
359,00:19:33,00:19:34,You can check surveillance.
360,00:19:34,00:19:35,I will.
361,00:19:35,00:19:38,Where can I find Mrs. Walsh? At my house.
362,00:19:38,00:19:40,With my cat.
363,00:19:40,00:19:42,And all my stuff.
364,00:19:46,00:19:49,You got something on Officer Nelson?
365,00:19:49,00:19:51,Yeah. I checked his phone records.
366,00:19:51,00:19:56,"Couple of hours before he died, Nelson got a call from a pay phone around the corner from the crime scene."
367,00:19:56,00:19:59,Liquor store cam caught a glimpse of our mystery caller.
368,00:19:59,00:20:04,"Judging by the outfit, I'd say she's a working girl. What's that in her pocket?"
369,00:20:06,00:20:09,RUSSELL: Yellow bandana.
370,00:20:09,00:20:11,Just like the one we found on Nelson.
371,00:20:11,00:20:18,"I'm thinking he got the drugs from her. DNA proved that a man killed Nelson, but if she was there, she could be involved, right?"
372,00:20:18,00:20:20,"Or, at the very least, a witness. Okay."
373,00:20:20,00:20:27,I'll have Brass round up all the hookers in Cracktown that look anything like her; maybe our police dog can pick her out of a lineup.
374,00:20:33,00:20:34,"(quietly): Oh, boy."
375,00:20:34,00:20:35,Ladies...
376,00:20:35,00:20:37,can I have your attention for a second?
377,00:20:37,00:20:40,"Hi. First of all, thank you for coming in."
378,00:20:40,00:20:42,"Did we have a choice? No, not really."
379,00:20:42,00:20:45,But I'll get you out of here as soon as I can.
380,00:20:45,00:20:47,"Okay, open up your jars there. Go ahead, open 'em up."
381,00:20:47,00:20:52,"Yeah, reach in and pull out the pipe, and hold it in your hand."
382,00:20:52,00:20:53,I'd rather hold on to your pipe.
383,00:20:53,00:20:57,"Uh, thank you, I appreciate that, but my wife frowns on that kind of thing."
384,00:20:57,00:20:59,Where do you want me to put this?
385,00:20:59,00:21:04,"Just hold on to it. By doing that, you're transferring your scent onto the pipe."
386,00:21:04,00:21:06,"If I rub it, will it get bigger?"
387,00:21:06,00:21:09,"Young lady, as long as you're holding it, I'm happy."
388,00:21:09,00:21:11,"All right, put 'em back in."
389,00:21:11,00:21:13,Thank you. Put the lids on.
390,00:21:13,00:21:16,There you go. Come on.
391,00:21:18,00:21:23,"Look, Sam, I know we got off to a bad start, and I know you miss your partner."
392,00:21:23,00:21:26,You guys were together a long time. (whimpers)
393,00:21:26,00:21:31,But I want the same thing you do-- to catch his killer.
394,00:21:31,00:21:34,I can't do that without your help.
395,00:21:36,00:21:38,You understand?
396,00:21:40,00:21:44,So... want to go to work?
397,00:22:11,00:22:12,"Hey, Sam. How you doing, boy?"
398,00:22:12,00:22:14,(whines)
399,00:22:14,00:22:16,Okay. Trouvez.
400,00:22:16,00:22:18,(sniffing)
401,00:22:20,00:22:21,(sniffing)
402,00:22:23,00:22:25,(sniffing)
403,00:22:25,00:22:28,(barks)
404,00:22:34,00:22:36,Recognize this?
405,00:22:36,00:22:38,Officer Nelson's partner did.
406,00:22:38,00:22:44,"He identified you as the working girl who gave Nelson this bandana, which was full of methamphetamine, by the way."
407,00:22:46,00:22:48,Hey.
408,00:22:48,00:22:53,"RUSSELL: Carly, we know you called Officer Nelson from a pay phone last night."
409,00:22:53,00:22:56,We know you met up with him and gave him the drugs.
410,00:22:56,00:22:57,And then you killed him.
411,00:22:57,00:23:00,"Gave him the drugs, that was it."
412,00:23:00,00:23:02,"Well, why would you do that? He wasn't a user."
413,00:23:02,00:23:03,"Ms. Green, we know all about you."
414,00:23:03,00:23:09,"We know that Officer Nelson arrested you for possession and prostitution, and sent you to prison for nine months."
415,00:23:09,00:23:11,Must have hated him for that.
416,00:23:11,00:23:15,"BRASS: So, last night, you lured him downtown and got one of your junkie friends to kill him."
417,00:23:15,00:23:17,"No, that's bull."
418,00:23:17,00:23:20,Mike was the only person who gave a damn about me.
419,00:23:20,00:23:22,He even visited me in prison.
420,00:23:22,00:23:25,"Okay, so why did you call him then?"
421,00:23:28,00:23:31,Mike used to pay me for info.
422,00:23:31,00:23:34,"When something new hit the streets, I'd turn it over to him."
423,00:23:34,00:23:36,Help him go after the dealers.
424,00:23:39,00:23:43,"Are you telling me, you're a C.I.?"
425,00:23:43,00:23:45,You were Officer Nelson's confidential informant?
426,00:23:45,00:23:48,Yeah.
427,00:23:48,00:23:50,It was Mike's way of giving me a second chance.
428,00:23:52,00:23:56,"Look, I gave him the drugs, told him what I knew and beat it."
429,00:23:56,00:23:59,"When I left, he was still alive."
430,00:24:10,00:24:12,What are you doing?
431,00:24:12,00:24:16,"The GCMS is broken, and the repairman's on vacation."
432,00:24:16,00:24:18,So you're fixing it yourself?
433,00:24:18,00:24:19,Are you even qualified to do that?
434,00:24:19,00:24:21,I am a man of many talents.
435,00:24:21,00:24:28,"I'm just saying, defense attorneys love to challenge our findings in court, and if this is not fixed exactly to code, you are gonna be in..."
436,00:24:28,00:24:32,"Okay, can... can we just forget the GCMS for a moment?"
437,00:24:33,00:24:36,Can you and I talk about...
438,00:24:36,00:24:37,you know?
439,00:24:40,00:24:42,No.
440,00:24:42,00:24:44,"So, we're just gonna pretend like it never happened?"
441,00:24:44,00:24:46,Yes.
442,00:24:46,00:24:53,"Now, when you are up and running, I need results on the red smudge on my victim's shirt, please."
443,00:24:53,00:24:54,Okay.
444,00:24:54,00:24:55,Okay.
445,00:24:55,00:24:56,(laughs softly)
446,00:24:58,00:25:00,Thanks for stopping in.
447,00:25:00,00:25:02,Yeah.
448,00:25:06,00:25:08,"So, you and Hodges doing it?"
449,00:25:08,00:25:09,What? No.
450,00:25:09,00:25:10,I think it's great really.
451,00:25:10,00:25:13,"He's funny, he's charming, smart."
452,00:25:13,00:25:14,He's like an awkward Jimmy Stewart.
453,00:25:14,00:25:17,"Okay, you know what? I kissed him."
454,00:25:17,00:25:18,Once. Really?
455,00:25:18,00:25:19,I was at the hospital.
456,00:25:19,00:25:21,My dad had been shot. It just happened.
457,00:25:21,00:25:23,And now things are all awkward between us.
458,00:25:23,00:25:24,(sighs)
459,00:25:24,00:25:26,Did you get anything off the gun?
460,00:25:26,00:25:30,"Uh, did not get any prints, but it is definitely our murder weapon."
461,00:25:30,00:25:33,Striations matched the slug we pulled out of the wall.
462,00:25:33,00:25:35,And this is where it really gets good.
463,00:25:35,00:25:37,The gun was registered to Barry Sloan himself.
464,00:25:37,00:25:39,Shot by his own gun?
465,00:25:39,00:25:40,Mm.
466,00:25:40,00:25:44,"So, Brent Walsh's alibi checked out."
467,00:25:44,00:25:47,But he claims that his ex was sleeping with the vic.
468,00:25:47,00:25:49,(moaning)
469,00:25:49,00:25:53,Which would give her access to Sloan's house and his gun.
470,00:25:54,00:25:56,Let's bring her in.
471,00:26:00,00:26:03,"Hey, Doc, got your 911. What's up?"
472,00:26:03,00:26:05,Body was just brought in.
473,00:26:05,00:26:08,Fingerprints matched a person of interest in your dead cop case.
474,00:26:08,00:26:11,"Okay, let's take a look."
475,00:26:19,00:26:21,That's Carly Green.
476,00:26:23,00:26:24,I interviewed her earlier today.
477,00:26:24,00:26:26,What--what happened to her?
478,00:26:26,00:26:28,Found her at the Blue Siren Motel with a needle in her arm.
479,00:26:28,00:26:30,Apparent overdose.
480,00:26:30,00:26:33,Yeah.
481,00:26:36,00:26:39,Heard Hooker Number Four OD'd. Carly Green.
482,00:26:39,00:26:42,Detective just logged in the evidence from her motel room.
483,00:26:42,00:26:44,"Lots of condoms, needles."
484,00:26:44,00:26:47,"Live hard, die hard... so to speak."
485,00:26:50,00:26:51,Bloody bandage.
486,00:26:51,00:26:55,Did Russell say anything about Carly having other injuries? No.
487,00:26:55,00:26:57,Doc's doing her autopsy right now.
488,00:26:57,00:27:01,But I did find this LVPD envelope.
489,00:27:01,00:27:03,It looks just like the one we found in Nelson's truck.
490,00:27:03,00:27:05,There's 800 bucks in there.
491,00:27:05,00:27:09,"Carly said Nelson was paying her as a C.I., so I checked with Sergeant Varanski."
492,00:27:09,00:27:11,Said Nelson hadn't worked Narcotics in over a year.
493,00:27:11,00:27:15,"Well, Nelson must have been paying her from his own pocket."
494,00:27:15,00:27:17,Unless he was paying her for something else.
495,00:27:17,00:27:21,"I mean, she was a hooker."
496,00:27:21,00:27:23,She wasn't a thousand dollar a night hooker.
497,00:27:23,00:27:26,Something was going on between them.
498,00:27:26,00:27:29,ROBBINS: Carly Green didn't commit suicide.
499,00:27:29,00:27:31,"D.B., take a look."
500,00:27:31,00:27:32,Needle didn't hit a vein.
501,00:27:35,00:27:37,RUSSELL: She has track marks.
502,00:27:37,00:27:39,She was a regular user.
503,00:27:39,00:27:42,You'd think she'd know how to find a vein.
504,00:27:42,00:27:44,That's what kept me looking.
505,00:27:44,00:27:46,Found this.
506,00:27:46,00:27:48,It's a needle mark right in the middle of her back.
507,00:27:48,00:27:50,She couldn't do that herself.
508,00:27:50,00:27:52,So Carly Green was murdered.
509,00:27:52,00:27:54,"Well, there's more."
510,00:27:54,00:27:56,Ms. Green was also pregnant.
511,00:27:56,00:28:00,"Based on the thickening of the uterus and the size of the fetus, I'd say about ten weeks."
512,00:28:00,00:28:05,"You know, she told me that Officer Nelson was the only person in her life who ever cared for her."
513,00:28:05,00:28:07,You think he was the father?
514,00:28:07,00:28:10,"Well, he spent a lot of time visiting her in prison, and he was giving her money."
515,00:28:10,00:28:12,All right.
516,00:28:12,00:28:14,Let's take a sample of the fetus's DNA.
517,00:28:14,00:28:16,Have Henry run it. Absolutely.
518,00:28:16,00:28:18,"All this time, I thought he was a dirty cop."
519,00:28:18,00:28:23,"Well, maybe he just got involved with the wrong woman, trying to make things right."
520,00:28:25,00:28:27,I didn't have sex with Barry Sloan.
521,00:28:27,00:28:30,"Yeah, you did... the night he died."
522,00:28:30,00:28:33,We pulled your DNA off of his... penis.
523,00:28:33,00:28:34,Mrs. Walsh?
524,00:28:34,00:28:37,"All right, I did."
525,00:28:37,00:28:42,"I know it was wrong to sleep with my husband's attorney, but sex with Barry was..."
526,00:28:44,00:28:46,He just kept you coming back for more.
527,00:28:46,00:28:51,We have evidence that you were not the only woman who came back for more last night.
528,00:28:51,00:28:53,(chuckles) Your DNA had company on his penis.
529,00:28:55,00:29:00,"You know, the thing about a three-way is, someone usually ends up being the third wheel."
530,00:29:00,00:29:03,It wasn't like that.
531,00:29:03,00:29:05,I had wild sex with Barry.
532,00:29:05,00:29:09,"When I was looking for my clothes, I found lace panties in his bed."
533,00:29:09,00:29:11,Not mine. Then whose?
534,00:29:11,00:29:12,Barry said he couldn't remember her name.
535,00:29:12,00:29:16,Some neighbor he was screwing. And how'd that make you feel?
536,00:29:16,00:29:18,"Not angry enough to kill him, if that's where you're going."
537,00:29:18,00:29:19,But you were angry.
538,00:29:19,00:29:21,"Ooh, you bet your ass I was."
539,00:29:21,00:29:22,We got into a big fight.
540,00:29:22,00:29:24,Then I went home.
541,00:29:24,00:29:25,What time was that?
542,00:29:25,00:29:30,"Around 5:30, 6:00."
543,00:29:30,00:29:33,Hm. That's right around the time he was killed.
544,00:29:38,00:29:40,(sniffs)
545,00:29:40,00:29:43,"If you're really hungry, I'll share half my sandwich with you."
546,00:29:43,00:29:45,(laughs)
547,00:29:45,00:29:47,No. It's for the dog. He's not eating for some reason.
548,00:29:47,00:29:49,"Well, he lost his partner, you know?"
549,00:29:49,00:29:51,He's probably still grieving.
550,00:29:51,00:29:53,Yeah.
551,00:29:53,00:29:57,"Okay, here's where we are."
552,00:29:57,00:30:01,Henry matched the DNA from the fetus to that piece of flesh that you pulled from your dog's teeth.
553,00:30:01,00:30:05,So Carly's baby daddy isn't Nelson.
554,00:30:05,00:30:06,It's the guy who killed him?
555,00:30:06,00:30:07,That's right. Yeah.
556,00:30:07,00:30:09,"He killed Carly, too."
557,00:30:09,00:30:12,That bloodied bandage we found in her motel room?
558,00:30:12,00:30:14,Yup. Also the killer's DNA.
559,00:30:14,00:30:18,And that's not all Henry found in the bandage.
560,00:30:18,00:30:20,Bacteria and leucocytes.
561,00:30:20,00:30:22,The killer's wound is infected.
562,00:30:22,00:30:24,From the dog taking a bite out of him.
563,00:30:24,00:30:26,He's going to need medical attention.
564,00:30:26,00:30:30,Robbins already checked all the local hospitals and free clinics in the area.
565,00:30:30,00:30:33,No dog bites reported in the last 24 hours.
566,00:30:33,00:30:36,"Well, there are some back alley clinics near the Blue Siren motel."
567,00:30:36,00:30:37,What are you gonna do?
568,00:30:37,00:30:38,You don't have a name.
569,00:30:38,00:30:39,You don't know who you're looking for.
570,00:30:39,00:30:42,No... but Sam does.
571,00:30:42,00:30:44,"Hey, Sam?"
572,00:30:44,00:30:47,I got a little something for you... here.
573,00:30:51,00:30:52,(phone chirps)
574,00:30:54,00:30:55,(phone beeps on)
575,00:30:58,00:31:04,"Thank God. Hey, I don't know how he got in here, but you got to get him out."
576,00:31:04,00:31:07,"I know, David. I'm sorry."
577,00:31:19,00:31:21,"Hey, boy."
578,00:31:22,00:31:25,Hey.
579,00:31:27,00:31:29,(sighs)
580,00:31:29,00:31:31,I should have known I'd find you in here.
581,00:31:38,00:31:40,"You really loved him, huh?"
582,00:31:40,00:31:43,It's hard when you lose a friend.
583,00:31:43,00:31:46,"You know, I lost a friend once."
584,00:31:46,00:31:49,Partner in the line of duty.
585,00:31:49,00:31:53,"I think it'll always hurt, 'cause..."
586,00:31:53,00:31:55,"well, I know I'll never see him again."
587,00:31:58,00:32:01,But you know what you can do for Mike?
588,00:32:01,00:32:04,"Together, you and me..."
589,00:32:04,00:32:07,we'll get a little justice.
590,00:32:07,00:32:09,Sound good?
591,00:32:12,00:32:14,(Sam whines)
592,00:32:21,00:32:22,(quiet whirring)
593,00:32:22,00:32:28,"Did you know that, in a lifetime, the average woman eats four pounds of lipstick?"
594,00:32:28,00:32:30,And that helps our case how?
595,00:32:30,00:32:33,I confirmed the red smudge on Barry Sloan's shirt as lipstick.
596,00:32:33,00:32:35,We knew that.
597,00:32:35,00:32:38,"Yes, but did you also know that lipstick, like food, can go bad?"
598,00:32:38,00:32:41,"And to preserve its shelf life, cosmetic companies used to use formaldehyde."
599,00:32:41,00:32:44,There's formaldehyde in my lipstick?
600,00:32:44,00:32:50,"Formaldehyde is a carcinogen, so cosmetic companies these days use metheneamine, which is a different type of preservative."
601,00:32:50,00:32:53,"Okay, so what about the lipstick in our case?"
602,00:32:53,00:33:00,"Well, the lipstick in our case contains straight formaldehyde, and was manufactured by a company that went out of business in 1972."
603,00:33:00,00:33:04,Are you sure the GCMS is working properly?
604,00:33:04,00:33:06,"I fixed it myself. Oh, whatever you say."
605,00:33:06,00:33:08,But who wears 40-year-old lipstick?
606,00:33:11,00:33:13,FINLAY: Mrs. Randall...
607,00:33:13,00:33:14,"Oh, call me Marjorie."
608,00:33:14,00:33:19,"Marjorie, you told me that you and Barry Sloan were good friends. That's right."
609,00:33:19,00:33:23,Good enough to have left lipstick on his shirt?
610,00:33:24,00:33:33,"CSI's are searching your house right now, and when they compare your lipstick to the smudge on Barry's shirt, I'm... betting it's gonna match."
611,00:33:33,00:33:35,Lots of women wear lipstick.
612,00:33:35,00:33:41,This sample was much older than all of the women that Barry was sleeping with.
613,00:33:44,00:33:47,Were the two of you intimately involved?
614,00:33:49,00:33:53,"My husband left me ten years ago, for a younger woman."
615,00:33:54,00:33:57,I never thought I'd fall in love again.
616,00:33:57,00:34:00,(laughs quietly) Till I met Barry.
617,00:34:02,00:34:06,"For years, I never told him how I felt."
618,00:34:06,00:34:10,He always had some beautiful woman on his arm.
619,00:34:12,00:34:17,"But the other morning, I heard him arguing with one of them."
620,00:34:17,00:34:19,"Look, I never said we were exclusive."
621,00:34:19,00:34:21,You made me think we were.
622,00:34:21,00:34:24,"Come on, okay? We've been having fun."
623,00:34:24,00:34:26,"You really are a scumbag, you know that?"
624,00:34:26,00:34:29,Go to hell.
625,00:34:29,00:34:31,She was so mean to him.
626,00:34:31,00:34:33,So you saw an opportunity to make your move.
627,00:34:33,00:34:38,"Well, I wanted him to know that he was... appreciated."
628,00:34:40,00:34:41,That he was loved.
629,00:34:42,00:34:43,Marjorie.
630,00:34:43,00:34:44,Everything all right?
631,00:34:44,00:34:46,I heard you arguing with that woman.
632,00:34:46,00:34:48,I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
633,00:34:48,00:34:50,"Oh, no, no, you didn't."
634,00:34:50,00:34:52,I just wanted to make sure that you're okay.
635,00:34:54,00:34:56,You are so sweet.
636,00:34:56,00:34:57,I don't deserve you.
637,00:34:59,00:35:01,"Mmm... Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
638,00:35:01,00:35:02,What the hell are you doing!
639,00:35:02,00:35:03,I thought that...
640,00:35:03,00:35:08,"You're kidding, right? Hey, come on, you're old enough to be my mother. (scoffs)"
641,00:35:10,00:35:13,He humiliated me.
642,00:35:13,00:35:15,(crying): Just like my husband.
643,00:35:15,00:35:21,And you've been carrying that anger and that pain for all those years since your husband left.
644,00:35:21,00:35:23,So when Barry rejected you...
645,00:35:23,00:35:25,you snapped.
646,00:35:34,00:35:36,(thump)
647,00:35:36,00:35:38,(body thuds)
648,00:35:38,00:35:41,"Marjorie, we know that the gun was Barry's."
649,00:35:41,00:35:42,How did you get it?
650,00:35:42,00:35:45,He gave it to me.
651,00:35:45,00:35:48,"There'd been some break-ins in the neighborhood, and he wanted me to be safe."
652,00:35:50,00:35:53,I just wanted to be loved.
653,00:35:55,00:35:57,Is that so bad?
654,00:36:01,00:36:03,(siren wailing in distance)
655,00:36:03,00:36:05,The clinics down here fly under the radar.
656,00:36:05,00:36:08,"If you can call them that-- no licensed doctors, no nurses, no questions asked."
657,00:36:08,00:36:15,"BRASS: Well, whatever you want to call it, we're down to our last two. Only could be the dog's lost his mojo. Well, he can do this."
658,00:36:18,00:36:19,(Sam panting)
659,00:36:22,00:36:23,That's it.
660,00:36:23,00:36:25,Trouvez.
661,00:36:25,00:36:27,Go on.
662,00:36:33,00:36:35,(Sam whines)
663,00:36:41,00:36:42,(barks)
664,00:36:42,00:36:44,He's got something.
665,00:36:46,00:36:47,(Sam barks)
666,00:36:59,00:37:02,"BRASS (sighs): Great, he wants a burrito."
667,00:37:02,00:37:04,"No, no. Hang on a second."
668,00:37:10,00:37:12,(Sam sniffing)
669,00:37:12,00:37:14,"(Sam whines, growls softly)"
670,00:37:14,00:37:15,(curious groan)
671,00:37:17,00:37:19,(growls)
672,00:37:21,00:37:22,(barks) That's him!
673,00:37:22,00:37:23,Police! Stop!
674,00:37:24,00:37:26,(gunshots) STOKES: Move! Move!
675,00:37:26,00:37:28,BRASS (over radio): Shots fired! Officer in pursuit! Send backup!
676,00:37:33,00:37:34,(panting)
677,00:37:42,00:37:44,"(Sam barks, snarls)"
678,00:37:47,00:37:48,(barking)
679,00:37:50,00:37:52,STOKES: Hey!
680,00:37:56,00:37:58,(panting)
681,00:38:10,00:38:12,"(gunshot, gun clatters to ground)"
682,00:38:12,00:38:15,"(barks, growls) (yelling)"
683,00:38:15,00:38:17,Get him off me! I didn't do nothin'!
684,00:38:17,00:38:20,"I don't know, I'm kind of new at this whole dog thing."
685,00:38:20,00:38:23,"Let me see, uh, hmm--release him."
686,00:38:23,00:38:25,"(yelling) Get him off me! STOKES: No, no-- drop him?"
687,00:38:25,00:38:26,"No, uh, it's..."
688,00:38:26,00:38:28,STOKES: Hmm... (yelling continues)
689,00:38:28,00:38:30,Laisser tomber.
690,00:38:30,00:38:32,(Sam barks)
691,00:38:32,00:38:33,(pants)
692,00:38:33,00:38:39,"You see, the dog over there thinks that you killed his partner, Officer Nelson."
693,00:38:39,00:38:42,(siren approaching) You know what I think?
694,00:38:47,00:38:49,I think he's right.
695,00:38:52,00:38:53,(Sam growls)
696,00:38:57,00:38:58,You're under arrest for murder.
697,00:38:58,00:39:03,"Take this scumbag to the hospital, then book him."
698,00:39:03,00:39:06,"Good job, Fido."
699,00:39:06,00:39:07,"STOKES: Hey, Sammy."
700,00:39:07,00:39:09,(chuckles) (Sam whining)
701,00:39:09,00:39:11,Oui. Tres bien. (chuckles)
702,00:39:11,00:39:13,Good boy.
703,00:39:13,00:39:15,Good...
704,00:39:15,00:39:17,(panting)
705,00:39:17,00:39:19,(Sam whining)
706,00:39:21,00:39:24,"I need a little help here, boys!"
707,00:39:24,00:39:27,(Brass speaking indistinctly)
708,00:39:27,00:39:30,"Okay, sign it. Sign it."
709,00:39:34,00:39:35,(sighs)
710,00:39:36,00:39:38,Did you get a confession?
711,00:39:38,00:39:40,Vinnie was a regular songbird.
712,00:39:40,00:39:44,"He wanted Carly to get rid of the baby, so she went to Nelson for help."
713,00:39:44,00:39:45,"Well, Vinnie followed her."
714,00:39:45,00:39:46,He sees them.
715,00:39:46,00:39:50,"He's loaded on methamphetamine, he's tweaking out of his mind, he kills Nelson right in front of her."
716,00:39:50,00:39:52,Poor Carly.
717,00:39:52,00:39:54,Too scared to talk to us.
718,00:39:54,00:39:57,"Vinnie couldn't take the chance, so he kills her."
719,00:39:57,00:40:00,And her baby.
720,00:40:00,00:40:02,STOKES: I don't know; I'm still waiting.
721,00:40:02,00:40:04,He's been in there for a couple hours.
722,00:40:04,00:40:07,"Nah, nah, I'm okay."
723,00:40:07,00:40:10,"Hey, listen, I got to go."
724,00:40:10,00:40:11,"I'll call you back, okay?"
725,00:40:11,00:40:13,All right.
726,00:40:16,00:40:18,So?
727,00:40:18,00:40:19,How's he doing?
728,00:40:19,00:40:21,Sam made it through surgery.
729,00:40:21,00:40:22,And?
730,00:40:22,00:40:25,Vet said he's going to be okay.
731,00:40:25,00:40:27,(laughs quietly)
732,00:40:27,00:40:28,Wow.
733,00:40:28,00:40:30,"Well, that's--that's good."
734,00:40:30,00:40:34,I didn't even know Sam had been shot.
735,00:40:34,00:40:36,He just kept going.
736,00:40:36,00:40:38,Mm. That's Sam for you.
737,00:40:38,00:40:39,"Ah, here he is."
738,00:40:41,00:40:43,"Hey, how you doing, boy?"
739,00:40:43,00:40:46,Huh?
740,00:40:49,00:40:50,"You did it, Sam."
741,00:40:50,00:40:51,You caught Mike's killer.
742,00:40:51,00:40:55,He's going to prison for a very long time.
743,00:40:55,00:40:56,And we got some justice.
744,00:40:58,00:41:04,"But don't you ever scare me like that again, you hear me?"
745,00:41:07,00:41:09,"You know, uh..."
746,00:41:09,00:41:16,"Sam was going to retire at the end of the year, spend the rest of his days with Nelson, just being a dog."
747,00:41:16,00:41:21,"Nelson didn't have any family, so, uh, Sam's going to need a new home."
748,00:41:23,00:41:26,"Well, I guess he could come live with me."
749,00:41:26,00:41:27,That'd be nice.
750,00:41:27,00:41:29,"What do you say, Sam?"
751,00:41:29,00:41:31,I'll take good care of you.
752,00:41:31,00:41:34,"Now, there's gonna be a few rules, okay?"
753,00:41:34,00:41:41,"No drinking out of the toilet, and, uh, we watch football on Sundays, and we root for the Cowboys."
754,00:41:41,00:41:43,(whimpers) Okay?
755,00:41:43,00:41:48,"And when my girlfriend's over, you got to sleep on the floor."
756,00:41:48,00:41:49,All right? Is that a deal?
757,00:41:52,00:41:54,(laughing)
758,00:41:57,00:41:59,"Okay, boy."
759,00:41:59,00:42:01,"Ah, geez!"
