0,00:01:20,00:01:22,Is this some kind of convention?
1,00:01:22,00:01:23,Little people convention.
2,00:01:23,00:01:26,Every year they come from all over the world to a designated city.
3,00:01:26,00:01:27,"Socialize, network."
4,00:01:27,00:01:30,"It's their prom, Olympics, and New Year's Eve all rolled into one."
5,00:01:31,00:01:32,"Oh, hey."
6,00:01:32,00:01:34,Excuse me.
7,00:01:34,00:01:36,"Don't think so, square jaw."
8,00:01:36,00:01:38,"SIDLE: Grissom, how do you know this?"
9,00:01:38,00:01:41,I get the newsletter.
10,00:01:43,00:01:47,"BRASS: Lawrence Ames, clothing salesman from Phoenix."
11,00:01:47,00:01:51,"He's 35, four foot, five inches tall."
12,00:01:51,00:01:54,"One of the, uh, convention organizers found him."
13,00:01:54,00:01:56,She was checking out the stage.
14,00:01:56,00:01:59,There's a fashion show tomorrow if you're interested.
15,00:01:59,00:02:00,She looked up and saw him.
16,00:02:00,00:02:02,SIDLE: Guy does a suicide in a public place.
17,00:02:02,00:02:03,He was trying to make a statement.
18,00:02:03,00:02:05,Suicide?
19,00:02:05,00:02:06,It's a reasonable suspicion.
20,00:02:06,00:02:11,STOKES: Suicide among any disability group is above average.
21,00:02:11,00:02:13,"Being a dwarf doesn't mean you're disabled, Nick."
22,00:02:13,00:02:14,It means you're... short.
23,00:02:17,00:02:19,I think we've got a little murder.
24,00:02:56,00:02:58,My favorite CSI.
25,00:02:58,00:03:00,I was hoping you'd get the call out.
26,00:03:00,00:03:02,Look who is back in town.
27,00:03:02,00:03:03,"So, what happened, Drew?"
28,00:03:03,00:03:06,"You didn't like, uh, Idaho? Is that it?"
29,00:03:06,00:03:07,Had everything but you.
30,00:03:07,00:03:09,"(chuckling): Yeah, right."
31,00:03:09,00:03:11,"So, what do we got?"
32,00:03:11,00:03:12,"One body, male Caucasian."
33,00:03:12,00:03:14,Looks like a home invasion.
34,00:03:14,00:03:15,"Listen, I'm headed next door."
35,00:03:15,00:03:18,"I'm going to talk to a neighbor heard shouting, called 9-1-1."
36,00:03:18,00:03:19,Keep me posted?
37,00:03:19,00:03:21,Always did.
38,00:03:25,00:03:27,Hi.
39,00:03:27,00:03:28,Willows.
40,00:03:28,00:03:30,Akers.
41,00:03:30,00:03:31,You clear the place?
42,00:03:31,00:03:32,Just finishing.
43,00:03:32,00:03:35,Okay.
44,00:03:35,00:03:37,(sighs)
45,00:03:43,00:03:44,(groans)
46,00:03:44,00:03:47,(cell phone ringing)
47,00:03:47,00:03:49,Yeah?
48,00:03:49,00:03:51,"Oh, hey, Warrick."
49,00:03:51,00:03:56,"Uh, yeah, it's, uh some kind of home invasion gone bad."
50,00:03:56,00:03:57,Don't run any lights.
51,00:03:57,00:04:00,I'll just process till the coroner gets here.
52,00:04:00,00:04:03,Okay. Cool.
53,00:04:03,00:04:08,"We were just pulling out of the chili place when dispatch radio, uh arrived on the scene at 1900 hours."
54,00:04:08,00:04:10,My partner secured the perimeter.
55,00:04:10,00:04:11,I've been in here...
56,00:04:11,00:04:13,This your first time on body watch?
57,00:04:13,00:04:15,Well...
58,00:04:15,00:04:18,alive...
59,00:04:18,00:04:20,it's inside your bowels.
60,00:04:20,00:04:21,"Dead, it ends up on the floor."
61,00:04:21,00:04:23,(gagging)
62,00:04:23,00:04:25,"Go. Go, go, go. Just get some air."
63,00:04:26,00:04:29,(chuckles)
64,00:05:07,00:05:09,(yells)
65,00:05:09,00:05:13,Suspect on location! Suspect on location!
66,00:05:16,00:05:19,(grunts)
67,00:05:19,00:05:20,(moaning)
68,00:05:20,00:05:21,Out back.
69,00:05:21,00:05:22,"Catherine, what happened?"
70,00:05:23,00:05:23,He went out back.
71,00:05:24,00:05:26,I'm all right.
72,00:05:26,00:05:27,I'm okay.
73,00:05:35,00:05:36,He must have gotten out the back window.
74,00:05:40,00:05:43,You the first officer on the scene?
75,00:05:43,00:05:45,"When you clear a place you clear it, do you understand?"
76,00:05:45,00:05:47,"Yes, sir, I'm sorry."
77,00:05:47,00:05:49,We lost a CSI two years ago because of the same mistake!
78,00:05:49,00:05:50,Warrick...
79,00:05:50,00:05:51,ease up.
80,00:05:51,00:05:53,My fault.
81,00:05:53,00:05:54,I sent him out.
82,00:05:54,00:05:58,Use your radio and call for backup.
83,00:06:00,00:06:02,Hey...
84,00:06:02,00:06:04,Hey.
85,00:06:04,00:06:05,Are you okay?
86,00:06:05,00:06:08,Yeah. I'm all right.
87,00:06:09,00:06:11,Don't touch me.
88,00:06:11,00:06:13,I'm evidence.
89,00:06:15,00:06:16,I got some fibers here.
90,00:06:16,00:06:18,Possibly secondary.
91,00:06:18,00:06:24,This rope was identical to the rope around the victim's neck.
92,00:06:24,00:06:25,"Wait, David."
93,00:06:26,00:06:27,Got a hair in the knot.
94,00:06:30,00:06:32,Killer's in the rope.
95,00:06:32,00:06:34,"I want to preserve this as is, so cut higher."
96,00:06:34,00:06:35,"Yes, sir."
97,00:06:45,00:06:49,"Hey, um, hand me a swab, would you?"
98,00:06:49,00:06:52,You know I could do this for you.
99,00:06:52,00:06:58,Not going to hurt any less.
100,00:07:00,00:07:02,(groans softly)
101,00:07:02,00:07:03,That cut is deep.
102,00:07:07,00:07:10,Damn.
103,00:07:12,00:07:16,"All right, um, hey, uh, turn around."
104,00:07:16,00:07:17,Huh?
105,00:07:17,00:07:20,Privacy.
106,00:07:20,00:07:21,The guy bodied me full-on.
107,00:07:22,00:07:24,I don't want Trace to miss one hair or one fiber.
108,00:07:38,00:07:41,You decent?
109,00:07:50,00:07:54,Looks like we're up.
110,00:08:14,00:08:16,These scars are old.
111,00:08:17,00:08:19,Tell me this wasn't bone-lengthening surgery.
112,00:08:19,00:08:22,ROBBINS: Probably done when he was a teenager.
113,00:08:22,00:08:26,Surgical pins are inserted into the bone and linked to an external screw.
114,00:08:26,00:08:28,"Turn the screw, it cracks the bones."
115,00:08:28,00:08:30,Osteogenic cells flood in.
116,00:08:30,00:08:32,Callus forms to bridge the gap.
117,00:08:32,00:08:36,The fractures heal and the bone gets longer.
118,00:08:36,00:08:41,You have to break the bones every four to six hours a quarter millimeter at a time.
119,00:08:41,00:08:44,Excruciating pain...
120,00:08:44,00:08:46,for an extra few inches.
121,00:08:46,00:08:52,"What people will endure to be ""normal."" ""What fools these mortals be."" Hmm."
122,00:08:53,00:08:55,"So, hanging?"
123,00:08:55,00:08:56,At least.
124,00:08:56,00:09:00,COD was asphyxiation due to strangulation.
125,00:09:00,00:09:03,Give me a hand here.
126,00:09:03,00:09:08,Bruise behind the ear is characteristic of a hanging.
127,00:09:08,00:09:10,This bruise is not.
128,00:09:10,00:09:12,"What is that, blunt force?"
129,00:09:12,00:09:15,Take a look at this.
130,00:09:16,00:09:21,Separation of the first and second vertebrae priorto death.
131,00:09:21,00:09:23,He was paralyzed?
132,00:09:23,00:09:28,That's something that would only happen to a dwarf with pseudoachondroplasia.
133,00:09:28,00:09:32,Physiology can make for cervical spine instability.
134,00:09:32,00:09:35,So it's possible that whoever did this knew something about dwarf anatomy.
135,00:09:59,00:10:00,Suspect on location!
136,00:10:02,00:10:04,He was drinking.
137,00:10:06,00:10:08,It was beer.
138,00:10:10,00:10:12,I'll go process the back.
139,00:10:47,00:10:49,Denim fiber from the cabinet.
140,00:10:49,00:10:51,Could be nothing.
141,00:10:51,00:10:57,And lots of smudges but no prints worthwhile.
142,00:10:57,00:11:01,"Yeah, I didn't get any prints either but I did get a partial shoe tread from the back gate."
143,00:11:02,00:11:07,And I don't think our dead guy lived here.
144,00:11:07,00:11:10,Based on...?
145,00:11:10,00:11:11,These pictures.
146,00:11:11,00:11:18,Got Detective Wolf looking for the homeowner's name from the real estate records.
147,00:11:18,00:11:21,"So, our home invasion robbery may be not a home invasion after all."
148,00:11:24,00:11:26,"So, would you mind if we tape-lifted your shirt?"
149,00:11:27,00:11:28,Comb your hair for evidence?
150,00:11:28,00:11:29,Evidence of what?
151,00:11:29,00:11:34,"Well, the first person at a crime scene often turns out to be a viable suspect."
152,00:11:34,00:11:36,I'm the one that found his body.
153,00:11:36,00:11:38,I'm the one that called it in.
154,00:11:38,00:11:41,If you're innocent it'll rule you out.
155,00:11:41,00:11:42,Go ahead.
156,00:11:47,00:11:50,Does he ever talk?
157,00:11:50,00:11:51,Yeah.
158,00:11:52,00:11:53,"At, uh, random intervals."
159,00:11:53,00:11:56,I was admiring your reaching tool.
160,00:11:56,00:11:58,I have one I use to wipe my tush with.
161,00:11:59,00:12:01,"Would you like to take a look at that, too?"
162,00:12:02,00:12:07,"Hey, if the world doesn't adapt itself to you you have to adapt yourself to it, right?"
163,00:12:07,00:12:09,Yeah.
164,00:12:09,00:12:12,"You know, you probably think I'm cold."
165,00:12:12,00:12:16,Pulling slots after I found Lawrence up there.
166,00:12:16,00:12:18,This is the convention.
167,00:12:18,00:12:19,Everything moves at warp speed.
168,00:12:19,00:12:23,I'm done. Thank you.
169,00:12:30,00:12:34,"You know, 51 weeks in your hometown with nothing but average-sized people."
170,00:12:34,00:12:36,I have to fit a lifetime into this week.
171,00:12:36,00:12:39,We all do.
172,00:12:39,00:12:40,"Business connections, gambling, romance."
173,00:12:41,00:12:42,Excuse me.
174,00:12:42,00:12:45,Did Lawrence have any problems in those areas?
175,00:12:45,00:12:46,Romance? Not at all.
176,00:12:46,00:12:48,Lawrence was a pseudo.
177,00:12:48,00:12:51,He could have his pick of any girl in here.
178,00:12:53,00:12:55,What's a pseudo?
179,00:12:55,00:13:00,Dwarfs with pseudoachondroplasia have features and head size like normal people.
180,00:13:00,00:13:05,Dwarfs with achondroplasia have shortened limbs and enlarged heads.
181,00:13:05,00:13:08,"Different types of dwarfs, different social status?"
182,00:13:08,00:13:12,Hey... discrimination isn't just for tall people.
183,00:13:26,00:13:28,Excuse me.
184,00:13:30,00:13:32,"Isn't this, uh, Lawrence Ames's room?"
185,00:13:32,00:13:34,Yes.
186,00:13:34,00:13:36,Who are you?
187,00:13:40,00:13:42,(sighs)
188,00:13:42,00:13:44,I'm his fiancee.
189,00:13:48,00:13:50,We always got those looks.
190,00:13:50,00:13:53,"I'm five-seven, in case you were wondering."
191,00:13:53,00:13:56,Our concern isn't your height; it's your proximity.
192,00:13:56,00:13:59,You're standing in a potential crime scene.
193,00:14:00,00:14:03,Would you please sit down here?
194,00:14:03,00:14:07,We want to keep the contamination to a minimum.
195,00:14:07,00:14:09,This is CSI Sidle.
196,00:14:09,00:14:12,We need a uniform in room 312 right away.
197,00:14:12,00:14:14,Thanks.
198,00:14:16,00:14:19,Didn't the police tell you not to come in here?
199,00:14:19,00:14:20,Yes.
200,00:14:20,00:14:23,But I wanted to be near Lawrence's things.
201,00:14:23,00:14:27,"And, um... these are Lawrence's things?"
202,00:14:28,00:14:29,Yes.
203,00:14:42,00:14:43,Sara?
204,00:14:43,00:14:46,Yeah?
205,00:14:53,00:14:56,Gouge is deeper at the bottom than the top.
206,00:14:56,00:14:59,So the strike was made coming down.
207,00:15:17,00:15:19,Grissom.
208,00:15:24,00:15:28,"Did you and Mr. Ames have an argument, say last night?"
209,00:15:28,00:15:29,No.
210,00:15:32,00:15:35,You don't believe me?
211,00:15:35,00:15:39,"Well, right now, we believe the evidence."
212,00:15:42,00:15:46,What are the marks on his forearms?
213,00:15:46,00:15:47,"Hmm, can't say."
214,00:15:47,00:15:52,But I do know that Teddy Henders died from blunt force trauma.
215,00:15:52,00:15:53,"From what, do you think?"
216,00:15:53,00:15:55,"A hammer, butt of a gun?"
217,00:15:55,00:15:57,I was just going to see if I could figure that out.
218,00:15:58,00:15:59,(electric razor buzzing)
219,00:16:09,00:16:11,(turns off razor)
220,00:16:15,00:16:18,"""Z""?"
221,00:16:19,00:16:25,There was a Z-Mover video game on the floor next to the vic.
222,00:16:26,00:16:28,Murder by Z-Mover.
223,00:16:28,00:16:30,The neighbors heard shouting.
224,00:16:30,00:16:35,Two guys break and enter and get into some kind of an alternation.
225,00:16:41,00:16:43,One ends up killing the other.
226,00:16:43,00:16:45,And almost Catherine.
227,00:16:47,00:16:49,"That had to be scary, huh?"
228,00:16:49,00:16:52,"I didn't have time to be scared, David."
229,00:16:52,00:16:54,Oh.
230,00:17:09,00:17:12,Is the lipstick on this champagne glass yours?
231,00:17:12,00:17:14,No champagne for me.
232,00:17:14,00:17:16,I'm pregnant.
233,00:17:16,00:17:18,Only seven weeks.
234,00:17:18,00:17:21,"Is this your computer, or Lawrence's?"
235,00:17:21,00:17:23,Lawrence's.
236,00:17:23,00:17:26,We're going to have to take it with us.
237,00:17:32,00:17:33,BROWN: Cath?
238,00:17:33,00:17:35,You all right?
239,00:17:37,00:17:40,Don't let him get to you like that.
240,00:17:40,00:17:42,Iwasscared...
241,00:17:43,00:17:45,and I still am.
242,00:17:45,00:17:48,Don't tell anybody.
243,00:17:51,00:17:52,"Hey, Greg."
244,00:17:52,00:17:53,Hey.
245,00:17:54,00:17:55,Get anything off the rope?
246,00:17:55,00:17:58,"Yeah, a few brown hairs around the knot."
247,00:17:58,00:18:00,"Only one with a skin tag, though."
248,00:18:00,00:18:03,And those fibers that Sara found on the body?
249,00:18:03,00:18:03,Yeah?
250,00:18:03,00:18:04,Polyester upholstery.
251,00:18:05,00:18:07,Cheap rugs and tacky furniture.
252,00:18:07,00:18:08,I need these hairs.
253,00:18:09,00:18:10,"Uh, uh, no DNA tags on those."
254,00:18:10,00:18:12,Doesn't matter.
255,00:18:12,00:18:13,(scoffs)
256,00:18:13,00:18:15,"You know, I hate it when he does that."
257,00:18:15,00:18:17,"I like to make a presentation, you know?"
258,00:18:17,00:18:18,"So, present."
259,00:18:18,00:18:19,"Eh, forget it."
260,00:18:20,00:18:21,Scope's interesting.
261,00:18:25,00:18:28,"All right, fresh epithelials."
262,00:18:28,00:18:31,"Yeah, I found them on the rope near the anchor point."
263,00:18:31,00:18:32,"A minuscule sample, but useable."
264,00:18:32,00:18:34,How long for DNA?
265,00:18:35,00:18:36,"Well, give me something to compare it to."
266,00:18:36,00:18:38,Get me the fiancee's blood.
267,00:18:38,00:18:40,"Well, I can't just give you her blood."
268,00:18:40,00:18:41,That takes a court order.
269,00:18:41,00:18:44,I'm open 24 hours.
270,00:18:48,00:18:51,"""Met you in a pseudo chat room."
271,00:18:51,00:18:58,"Do you remember me?"" ""I remember you."" (muttering)"
272,00:18:58,00:19:00,"""...to the convention this year?"
273,00:19:00,00:19:01,"""I'd love to meet you."
274,00:19:01,00:19:03,"""See if you can pick me out."
275,00:19:03,00:19:09,"""Perfect face ""perfect body."
276,00:19:09,00:19:24,"Count of three, handsome."" SIDLE: Jessica, you knew Lawrence was having an on-line affair with another woman didn't you?"
277,00:19:24,00:19:27,BRASS: You logged on at times when Lawrence was at work.
278,00:19:27,00:19:28,We checked his work records.
279,00:19:29,00:19:31,A lot of girls liked Lawrence.
280,00:19:31,00:19:33,He was funny and smart and sweet.
281,00:19:33,00:19:34,Danielle was different.
282,00:19:34,00:19:37,She was his size.
283,00:19:37,00:19:40,She was... perfect.
284,00:19:40,00:19:42,We found your skin cells on the rope that hung Lawrence.
285,00:19:42,00:19:45,You're making that up.
286,00:19:45,00:19:46,"No, I'm not."
287,00:19:46,00:19:48,BRASS: Our court order your blood.
288,00:19:48,00:19:51,I did not put a noose around my fiancÃ©'s neck.
289,00:19:51,00:19:53,Then explain how your skin cells got on the rope.
290,00:19:53,00:19:55,I can't.
291,00:20:13,00:20:16,Hey.
292,00:20:16,00:20:18,Confronted the fiancee; she stonewalled us.
293,00:20:18,00:20:20,Brass told her not to leave town.
294,00:20:20,00:20:23,"He sounded a bit like Jack Lord, don't you think?"
295,00:20:23,00:20:24,"Well, she can go wherever she wants to."
296,00:20:24,00:20:25,She didn't do it.
297,00:20:26,00:20:27,Take a look.
298,00:20:27,00:20:30,Hair from the knot.
299,00:20:37,00:20:38,They look thin.
300,00:20:39,00:20:41,Diameter's 60% less than normal.
301,00:20:41,00:20:44,Tensile strength is also way below normal.
302,00:20:44,00:20:45,You have a cross section?
303,00:20:45,00:20:47,Mm-hmm.
304,00:20:50,00:20:52,Hmm. No pigment at the central core.
305,00:20:53,00:20:55,No color.
306,00:20:55,00:20:58,Cartilage hair hypoplasia.
307,00:20:58,00:21:00,C.H.H.
308,00:21:00,00:21:02,"It's characterized by fine, brittle body hair."
309,00:21:02,00:21:04,It's an extremely rare syndrome.
310,00:21:04,00:21:05,It's a form of dwarfism.
311,00:21:06,00:21:07,Okay.
312,00:21:07,00:21:08,"So, back to the midgets."
313,00:21:08,00:21:12,Nick... dwarfs or little people.
314,00:21:12,00:21:14,You'll need to know what to look for.
315,00:21:14,00:21:16,"So, I'll put together a list of C.H.H. attributes."
316,00:21:16,00:21:18,"Well, you better do it fast."
317,00:21:18,00:21:21,The convention's over in two days.
318,00:21:21,00:21:25,"After that, thelittle peoplego home and we lose all our suspects."
319,00:21:41,00:21:42,Ms. Grace?
320,00:21:43,00:21:45,Excuse me.
321,00:21:45,00:21:47,I need your help.
322,00:21:47,00:21:49,What now? My DNA?
323,00:21:49,00:21:51,"No, actually... your eyes."
324,00:21:55,00:22:00,"GRACE: I'm sorry, I don't recognize her and a girl this pretty I would remember."
325,00:22:00,00:22:02,The guys would still be drooling.
326,00:22:02,00:22:08,"Well, according to the police there's no one named Danielle registered at the hotel or at the convention."
327,00:22:08,00:22:11,You expected an Internet handle to be a real name?
328,00:22:11,00:22:14,Maybe the girl got cold feet.
329,00:22:14,00:22:21,"My first IOLP convention-- I walk in, see 200 dwarfs staring back at me and what goes through my head?"
330,00:22:21,00:22:26,"""There's no way I look like these people."" I ran."
331,00:22:26,00:22:27,But you went back.
332,00:22:27,00:22:28,Eventually.
333,00:22:28,00:22:33,I guess I realized it's nice to see eye-to-eye with someone.
334,00:22:33,00:22:36,Mm.
335,00:22:36,00:22:39,I get the impression that's a little tough for you.
336,00:22:41,00:22:51,"""The freaks have looked at her in a secret way ""and tried to connect their eyes with hers ""as though to say, 'We know who you are."
337,00:22:51,00:22:55,"We are you.'"" Faulkner."
338,00:22:55,00:22:56,Close.
339,00:22:56,00:22:59,Another southern writer. Carson McCullers.
340,00:22:59,00:23:04,I think we look for the differences in each other to prove that we're not alone.
341,00:23:06,00:23:08,What's yours?
342,00:23:08,00:23:09,Your difference?
343,00:23:11,00:23:13,Mine's the worst.
344,00:23:13,00:23:14,Random gene.
345,00:23:14,00:23:16,Anyone can have a dwarf.
346,00:23:16,00:23:22,Sometimes I've even seen terror in average-size people's eyes.
347,00:23:22,00:23:28,I remind them that their little carbon copies might not be such a copy after all.
348,00:23:30,00:23:39,"Well, mine's genetic progressive and impossible to predict."
349,00:23:39,00:23:41,And hard to notice...
350,00:23:41,00:23:43,unless you tell someone.
351,00:23:47,00:23:48,Got your beep.
352,00:23:48,00:23:49,What'd you get?
353,00:23:49,00:23:51,Denim fibers at 400x.
354,00:23:53,00:23:59,The skin from the dead guy and the denim found in the cabinet were both coated in the same substance.
355,00:23:59,00:24:01,You get a breakdown?
356,00:24:01,00:24:06,"Yeah, partially hydrogenated soy bean oil traces of beef fat, sugar and potato starch."
357,00:24:06,00:24:09,Cooking grease.
358,00:24:09,00:24:11,That would explain the marks on the guy's forearms.
359,00:24:11,00:24:12,Grease burns.
360,00:24:16,00:24:19,So there's a good chance the victim worked in a fast food joint.
361,00:24:19,00:24:21,WOLF: I got a feeling they both did.
362,00:24:21,00:24:25,The owner of the house has a franchise of fast food places.
363,00:24:25,00:24:27,"Uh, Fast and Fresh Burgers."
364,00:24:27,00:24:29,I just got off the phone with him from Hawaii.
365,00:24:29,00:24:31,Alvin Jackson.
366,00:24:31,00:24:32,Three stores in the Vegas area.
367,00:24:32,00:24:35,And he's on his yearly vacation.
368,00:24:35,00:24:37,Something his employees would definitely know.
369,00:24:39,00:24:40,Get any addresses?
370,00:24:40,00:24:41,You bet.
371,00:24:41,00:24:43,Let's go check it out.
372,00:24:45,00:24:49,SIDLE: We're looking for anything in the picture that might give us a way to find her.
373,00:24:49,00:24:53,"Something in the background that determines location a useful reflection, anything."
374,00:24:53,00:24:55,Huh...
375,00:24:55,00:24:56,"Oh, I get it."
376,00:24:56,00:24:58,"This is like a test, right?"
377,00:24:58,00:24:59,What do you mean?
378,00:24:59,00:25:04,Individual hair shadows are amorphous when they should be distinct.
379,00:25:04,00:25:12,In these two areas-- here and here-- they're on the same focal plane but this one's sharp and this one's fuzzy.
380,00:25:13,00:25:14,This picture's a fake?
381,00:25:14,00:25:15,A composite.
382,00:25:16,00:25:17,A very good one.
383,00:25:20,00:25:22,This explains why nobody ever saw her.
384,00:25:22,00:25:23,She only exists in pixels.
385,00:25:26,00:25:27,Nat King Cole.
386,00:25:27,00:25:29,Excuse me?
387,00:25:29,00:25:32,"Archie would you separate the composite elements, please?"
388,00:25:32,00:25:33,Yup.
389,00:25:39,00:25:41,The image was built out of these.
390,00:25:41,00:25:46,"GRISSOM: Now if you could, pull up a photo of the victim, grey scale."
391,00:25:51,00:25:58,There's a theory in art that the Mona Lisa was really a feminized version of Leonardo da Vinci himself.
392,00:25:58,00:26:01,Concept suggests... deep down we're all narcissists?
393,00:26:01,00:26:02,Yeah.
394,00:26:02,00:26:05,What attracts us the most is ourselves.
395,00:26:07,00:26:09,Scale to match the original picture with Danielle.
396,00:26:29,00:26:34,SIDLE: Danielle is a virtual woman created to attract and lure Lawrence Ames...
397,00:26:34,00:26:35,"away from his fiancee, maybe?"
398,00:26:35,00:26:38,"BRASS: Boy, do I have good timing, or what?"
399,00:26:39,00:26:41,I did a little checking with the phone company.
400,00:26:41,00:26:46,"In the past year, Lawrence Ames received over 200 calls from Melanie Grace."
401,00:26:46,00:26:47,The same woman that found him dead.
402,00:26:48,00:26:51,He got call-blocking against her two months ago.
403,00:26:51,00:26:52,"Well, that's interesting."
404,00:26:52,00:26:55,That's the same time Danielle started sending him instant messages.
405,00:26:57,00:26:58,"Yes, I called Lawrence."
406,00:26:58,00:26:59,We met in a chat room.
407,00:27:00,00:27:01,He also called me.
408,00:27:01,00:27:02,Did you look at myphone records?
409,00:27:02,00:27:04,He eventually blocked your calls.
410,00:27:04,00:27:07,The same week he got engaged to Jessica Marcus.
411,00:27:07,00:27:14,It was at that time he began receiving messages from... a perfect woman...
412,00:27:18,00:27:19,...who doesn't really exist.
413,00:27:21,00:27:22,You think that I would do that?
414,00:27:22,00:27:27,Present myself to a man as anything other than who I am?
415,00:27:27,00:27:29,If it would break up his new engagement.
416,00:27:31,00:27:32,So what happened?
417,00:27:32,00:27:38,You went to the convention you saw him with his tall girlfriend and you go to Plan B?
418,00:27:43,00:27:45,You think I'm capable of that?
419,00:27:45,00:27:50,Killing because a woman has some height on me?
420,00:27:50,00:27:53,Pretending to be an ideal...
421,00:27:53,00:27:57,If you think that...
422,00:27:57,00:27:59,then I was wrong about you.
423,00:28:17,00:28:18,Hey.
424,00:28:18,00:28:19,"Do you mind, little man?"
425,00:28:19,00:28:20,I'm trying to work here.
426,00:28:20,00:28:21,Really? Yeah.
427,00:28:22,00:28:24,"You making any progress, CSI man?"
428,00:28:26,00:28:27,Some. Uh-huh.
429,00:28:27,00:28:29,Are we getting your A-game or your B-game?
430,00:28:29,00:28:30,Come again?
431,00:28:30,00:28:35,You see us little people we're used to getting the short end of the stick.
432,00:28:35,00:28:36,(chuckles)
433,00:28:36,00:28:38,You don't get to laugh at that.
434,00:28:47,00:28:52,What I want to know is are you treating this like a case or like a joke?
435,00:28:53,00:28:55,"Well, a man was killed; that's no joke."
436,00:28:58,00:29:01,You got my A-game.
437,00:29:01,00:29:02,Yeah?
438,00:29:03,00:29:05,Yeah.
439,00:29:05,00:29:07,Carry on.
440,00:29:30,00:29:31,"Uh, Grissom."
441,00:29:31,00:29:34,"There's, uh, something weird going on with the hairs from the ropes."
442,00:29:34,00:29:36,"Well, not weird."
443,00:29:36,00:29:39,More like... hair-raising.
444,00:29:40,00:29:41,"Sorry, bad one."
445,00:29:42,00:29:48,"Um, okay, at first I thought that maybe I was doing something wrong-- running too many DNA samples, you know seeing things."
446,00:29:48,00:29:50,Greg?
447,00:29:50,00:29:51,(exhales)
448,00:29:51,00:29:56,"Uh, the dwarf hair has seven alleles in common with Jessica Marcus's skin cells."
449,00:29:58,00:29:59,The two donors are related.
450,00:29:59,00:30:01,Profiles say so.
451,00:30:01,00:30:03,(cell phone ringing)
452,00:30:06,00:30:07,Grissom.
453,00:30:07,00:30:09,STOKES: He looked like he fit your profile.
454,00:30:09,00:30:10,"So, I asked around."
455,00:30:10,00:30:13,Two little people confirmed he has C.H.H.
456,00:30:13,00:30:15,"Okay, thank you."
457,00:30:15,00:30:16,Yeah.
458,00:30:22,00:30:24,Kevin Marcus?
459,00:30:25,00:30:26,Buying or browsing?
460,00:30:27,00:30:28,Maybe a little bit of both.
461,00:30:28,00:30:31,"Rope for makeshift banisters, huh?"
462,00:30:31,00:30:32,That rag rope... cuts the hands.
463,00:30:33,00:30:34,Now you feel this nylon.
464,00:30:34,00:30:37,Go ahead feel that.
465,00:30:37,00:30:42,I do trade shows mail order...
466,00:30:42,00:30:44,I even sold to this convention.
467,00:30:44,00:30:48,"So what do you, buy from wholesalers and then repackage in your home?"
468,00:30:48,00:30:50,"Yeah, Chicago."
469,00:30:50,00:30:55,"Well, that explains how your daughter's skin cells got all over the rope that hung Lawrence Ames."
470,00:30:55,00:30:57,"Your daughter's name is Jessica, right?"
471,00:30:57,00:31:01,The lab also found your hair all over that rope.
472,00:31:01,00:31:03,"Well, I touch all the merchandise."
473,00:31:03,00:31:04,"Nice try, Kev."
474,00:31:04,00:31:07,They hair was caught in the noose.
475,00:31:10,00:31:13,Did you know your father killed Lawrence?
476,00:31:13,00:31:18,That's what they told me but I couldn't believe it.
477,00:31:18,00:31:21,I still can't.
478,00:31:21,00:31:25,So you created Danielle to break up your daughter's engagement.
479,00:31:25,00:31:27,That's an interesting theory.
480,00:31:29,00:31:31,What?
481,00:31:31,00:31:35,You guys trace an online account to my credit card or something like that?
482,00:31:35,00:31:37,"Oh, no, wait."
483,00:31:37,00:31:39,"Um, I use a free ISP."
484,00:31:39,00:31:45,"That means no name, no trail, no case."
485,00:31:47,00:31:51,"Mr. Marcus, in your business you deal with proportions, correct?"
486,00:31:51,00:31:57,You provide little people with what they need to compensate for their proportions and to live with them.
487,00:31:58,00:32:03,You know what little people aspire to be.
488,00:32:03,00:32:07,"Your, uh, logo is interesting."
489,00:32:07,00:32:16,"Da Vinci's ""Vitruvian Man."" In the perfect human form, arm span equals height."
490,00:32:18,00:32:25,"You're very aware of what, uh people are looking for in a mate aren't you?"
491,00:32:25,00:32:31,"The night before he died, Lawrence and I had a fight about Danielle."
492,00:32:31,00:32:33,Are still in contact with her?
493,00:32:33,00:32:35,She e-mails or IM's.
494,00:32:35,00:32:37,I don't answer. I love you.
495,00:32:37,00:32:39,You're lying. You're cheating on me!
496,00:32:42,00:32:48,And I ran out of the house and I went to my dad.
497,00:32:48,00:33:00,I was crying and he told me to leave Lawrence but I couldn't because... I... I loved him.
498,00:33:00,00:33:03,I'm having our baby.
499,00:33:03,00:33:07,And I went back to our room and we made up.
500,00:33:10,00:33:14,And the next night...
501,00:33:14,00:33:18,he said he was going out to meet a friend.
502,00:33:25,00:33:26,I'll be back in an hour.
503,00:33:29,00:33:31,And he never came back.
504,00:33:33,00:33:35,"So, what'd you have against the guy?"
505,00:33:35,00:33:36,"What are you, blind?"
506,00:33:36,00:33:39,He was a dwarf.
507,00:33:39,00:33:44,My wife and I our daughter-- a genetic miracle.
508,00:33:44,00:33:47,One-in-four shot she'd be an average.
509,00:33:47,00:33:49,And she was a beautiful average.
510,00:33:49,00:33:51,So your wife is also a dwarf.
511,00:33:51,00:33:53,Yeah.
512,00:33:53,00:33:57,"Jessica didn't have to fight the world every day, like we did."
513,00:33:57,00:33:59,We freed her from all that.
514,00:33:59,00:34:04,But that little bastard kept dragging her right back down into it.
515,00:34:04,00:34:05,So you killed him.
516,00:34:05,00:34:07,I said I didn't like the guy.
517,00:34:07,00:34:09,I didn't kill anybody.
518,00:34:13,00:34:15,(exhales deeply)
519,00:34:15,00:34:17,Can we prove it?
520,00:34:17,00:34:18,Not yet.
521,00:34:18,00:34:22,The rope was anchored to the lighting truss which was at least five feet over his head.
522,00:34:22,00:34:23,So?
523,00:34:23,00:34:25,He can barely lift his arms above his shoulders.
524,00:34:25,00:34:30,He suffers from lumbar lordosis swayback...
525,00:34:30,00:34:33,which is typical of C.H.H.
526,00:34:33,00:34:35,and it limits his mobility even more.
527,00:34:35,00:34:38,"Hey, the guy put a rope around the victim's neck."
528,00:34:38,00:34:41,"Yeah, but how did he hang him?"
529,00:34:49,00:34:53,"Listen, Catherine me and Warrick can handle this."
530,00:34:55,00:34:56,I'm going in.
531,00:34:56,00:34:57,"Well, the guy assaulted you."
532,00:34:57,00:35:00,"You don't have to put yourself through this, you know."
533,00:35:00,00:35:02,"I don't, I'll be scared of the next guy and the one after that."
534,00:35:08,00:35:11,"Shoe tread, denim fiber, a lot of cooking grease."
535,00:35:11,00:35:14,"Based on that evidence, theyalldid it."
536,00:35:14,00:35:18,"All right, so we take them one by one."
537,00:35:18,00:35:20,Transfer works both ways.
538,00:35:24,00:35:25,(unzipping)
539,00:35:25,00:35:26,Warrick?
540,00:35:30,00:35:31,Blow your nose.
541,00:35:32,00:35:33,I don't gotta.
542,00:35:41,00:35:43,(blowing)
543,00:35:49,00:35:50,Guess.
544,00:35:52,00:35:53,(blowing)
545,00:36:03,00:36:04,I don't think so.
546,00:36:04,00:36:09,Then I guess I'll just have to look for myself.
547,00:36:09,00:36:11,"You want to look at my boogers, lady, go ahead."
548,00:36:11,00:36:12,Hey!
549,00:36:24,00:36:28,Nose hairs... are nature's filter.
550,00:36:28,00:36:31,Traps all kinds of things.
551,00:36:31,00:36:35,"Dust, dirt..."
552,00:36:36,00:36:38,...fingerprint powder.
553,00:36:38,00:36:40,(exhales)
554,00:36:40,00:36:41,You did it.
555,00:36:41,00:36:44,(grunting)
556,00:36:44,00:36:48,You inhaled the fingerprint dust I was using.
557,00:36:48,00:36:55,We went up there to party 'cause the boss was out of town and I saw the Z-Mover first but Teddy... Teddy...
558,00:36:56,00:36:59,I saw it first.
559,00:36:59,00:37:00,I saw it first.
560,00:37:00,00:37:02,It's mine.
561,00:37:02,00:37:03,I saw it first. I called it.
562,00:37:03,00:37:04,"You want it, you bastard?!"
563,00:37:05,00:37:06,I didn't mean to kill him.
564,00:37:06,00:37:07,It was an accident.
565,00:37:07,00:37:09,"I mean, I..."
566,00:37:09,00:37:10,Get up.
567,00:37:10,00:37:12,I didn't mean...
568,00:37:19,00:37:20,You all right?
569,00:37:20,00:37:23,Yeah.
570,00:37:23,00:37:26,"NICK: Hey, did you get anything else off that laptop?"
571,00:37:26,00:37:28,"No, a bunch of the files were corrupted."
572,00:37:28,00:37:30,Archie's taking another run at them.
573,00:37:30,00:37:32,(sighs)
574,00:37:40,00:37:43,"Victim was paralyzed, couldn't fight back."
575,00:37:43,00:37:48,Kevin Marcus puts the rope around his neck makes a slip knot.
576,00:37:48,00:37:53,And ties off the other end on the truss even though there is no way he could have reached it.
577,00:37:53,00:37:55,No way he could've reached it.
578,00:38:10,00:38:13,"Nick, what are you doing?"
579,00:38:13,00:38:17,Changing my perspective.
580,00:38:17,00:38:19,"(groans): Oh, man."
581,00:38:19,00:38:22,Can you imagine going through life at this height?
582,00:38:22,00:38:24,They do okay.
583,00:38:24,00:38:27,"If the world doesn't adapt itself to you, you..."
584,00:38:27,00:38:30,...Adapt yourself to it.
585,00:38:39,00:38:41,Where's Grissom?
586,00:38:42,00:38:44,(patrons talking)
587,00:39:08,00:39:09,Grissom?
588,00:39:11,00:39:13,We know how he did it.
589,00:39:13,00:39:17,BRASS: Your wheelchair was in the booth at the convention.
590,00:39:17,00:39:23,The fibers from the seat cover to your wheelchair match the fibers we found on the victim.
591,00:39:23,00:39:26,"Uh, faux, fake sheepskin."
592,00:39:28,00:39:33,We also know how you got Mr. Ames into the theater.
593,00:39:33,00:39:41,Our lab retrieved a final instant message to Lawrence from Danielle.
594,00:39:46,00:39:49,"Mr. Marcus, what are you doing here?"
595,00:39:51,00:39:54,It's enough to convict you.
596,00:39:55,00:39:57,GRISSOM: May I ask a question?
597,00:39:57,00:40:00,How did you get him into the wheelchair?
598,00:40:02,00:40:06,Well... I appealed to his vanity.
599,00:40:07,00:40:12,I told him I needed a brochure model to sell my new chair.
600,00:40:12,00:40:15,You don't want me near your daughter but you want me to hawk your chairs?
601,00:40:15,00:40:18,I never said you weren't handsome.
602,00:40:18,00:40:26,"I mean, come on-- your face, your build-- a million chairs, ""Sold."" Great, come on."
603,00:40:26,00:40:28,Hop in.
604,00:40:28,00:40:30,"Hop in, let me see you in there."
605,00:40:30,00:40:31,Come on.
606,00:40:31,00:40:33,Model for me.
607,00:40:34,00:40:36,There you go.
608,00:40:36,00:40:39,"Wait, let me make an adjustment for you, here."
609,00:40:41,00:40:42,I paralyzed him.
610,00:40:57,00:40:59,I couldn't let Jessica marry him.
611,00:41:02,00:41:04,Any kid they have...
612,00:41:04,00:41:07,a 50% chance it would be a dwarf.
613,00:41:07,00:41:10,You have to understand that.
614,00:41:14,00:41:17,(sighs)
615,00:41:17,00:41:18,It's genetics.
616,00:41:21,00:41:24,"Mr. Marcus, I think you should know..."
617,00:41:24,00:41:29,your daughter is already pregnant by Lawrence Ames.
618,00:41:55,00:41:57,You know what's really sad?
619,00:41:57,00:41:59,This wasn't just a murder.
620,00:41:59,00:42:01,It was a hate crime.
621,00:42:01,00:42:04,Kevin Marcus hated himself.
622,00:42:33,00:42:35,"Dr. Grissom, welcome back."
623,00:42:49,00:42:51,Take care of yourself.
