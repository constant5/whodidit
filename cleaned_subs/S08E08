0	00:00:09	00:00:15	Ecklie's been on me to finish the monthly stats, so I need a list of all the Lab call-outs from Dispatch as soon as you can.
1	00:00:15	00:00:16	You'll have it by the end of shift tomorrow.
2	00:00:16	00:00:18	Thanks.
3	00:00:18	00:00:20	So, you've been pulling a lot of doubles this week.
4	00:00:20	00:00:22	Yeah, it's about all I do.
5	00:00:22	00:00:24	Have you been in touch with Sara?
6	00:00:24	00:00:25	We've talked a little.
7	00:00:25	00:00:27	So where's she at?
8	00:00:27	00:00:28	San Francisco. Visiting her mother.
9	00:00:29	00:00:30	No, I mean-- that's nice.
10	00:00:30	00:00:32	No, but I meant where's she at emotionally?
11	00:00:32	00:00:33	You know, with respect to the two of you.
12	00:00:34	00:00:35	I can't speak for her.
13	00:00:35	00:00:37	So speak for yourself.
14	00:00:37	00:00:39	I can't talk, I'm really busy.
15	00:02:05	00:02:14	So Archie's in the Garage, he's documenting evidence from a drug bust, he picks up a thing of coke, and then it blows up in his face?
16	00:02:14	00:02:22	No. He picks up a cellophane and duct-tape-wrapped kilo of coke, and the third one from the top of the stack blows up in his face. Oh.
17	00:02:22	00:02:23	It's important to be specific.
18	00:02:24	00:02:30	Okay, well, this game is not as much fun as I thought it was going to be-- It's not a game, it's a thought experiment.
19	00:02:30	00:02:32	If you want to be a good criminalist-- I am a good criminalist.
20	00:02:32	00:02:39	If you want to be a better criminalist, then you have to learn to train to-- Learn to think like a criminal. I know.
21	00:02:39	00:02:41	Look, I'm sure Grissom's told you...
22	00:02:44	00:02:47	that we speak for the dead.
23	00:02:47	00:02:51	Think of this exercise as a way for the dead to speak for themselves.
24	00:02:51	00:02:56	But that's not actually what this is-- It's a chance for you to be a CSI.
25	00:02:56	00:03:00	The only thing you need to do is answer two simple questions.
26	00:03:00	00:03:10	Whodunit and how?
27	00:03:43	00:03:45	After HazMat cleans up the scene...
28	00:03:45	00:03:47	the coroner does his thing...
29	00:03:47	00:03:48	No sign of sexual trauma.
30	00:03:48	00:03:50	What?
31	00:03:50	00:03:51	I believe he's legally required to check.
32	00:03:52	00:03:55	What the CSIs realize is-- I can't believe Archie's gone.
33	00:03:56	00:03:58	He was too good for this world.
34	00:04:01	00:04:02	What?
35	00:04:02	00:04:03	They would be very upset.
36	00:04:03	00:04:07	Can we at least stipulate that they heroically contain their bereavement?
37	00:04:07	00:04:09	Yes, I suppose Archie could live with that.
38	00:04:10	00:04:11	So to speak.
39	00:04:11	00:04:12	Thank you.
40	00:04:12	00:04:14	Mm-hmm.
41	00:04:14	00:04:16	What the CSIs realize is...
42	00:04:16	00:04:18	It's gotta be the dealer.
43	00:04:18	00:04:22	Yeah, he booby-trapped the stash so if the cops got the drugs...
44	00:04:22	00:04:24	Then they would get the boom along with it? Right?
45	00:04:24	00:04:26	Am I right? No, you're wrong.
46	00:04:26	00:04:28	Just let me finish the setup, okay? Sorry.
47	00:04:28	00:04:31	What the CSIs finally realize is...
48	00:04:31	00:04:33	They sorted everything already? That was quick.
49	00:04:33	00:04:36	Can you just let me finish!
50	00:04:38	00:04:44	According to this, 20 bricks of coke were logged into evidence just past midnight.
51	00:04:44	00:04:47	The explosion occurred about a half an hour later.
52	00:04:47	00:04:50	But there are 21 wrappers here.
53	00:04:51	00:05:00	And since no one entered or exited the Lab during that time frame, it means the explosive was planted in the suitcase here.
54	00:05:00	00:05:02	Which means...
55	00:05:02	00:05:04	The killer is someone in the Lab.
56	00:05:04	00:05:11	Well, if the killer is someone who works in the Lab, then he could just tamper with the evidence.
57	00:05:11	00:05:15	Which means that there's really no way for me to solve this thing, this a trick question.
58	00:05:16	00:05:18	No, no, no, that's not what I want...
59	00:05:18	00:05:20	My shoelace is untied.
60	00:05:20	00:05:22	Excuse me. Okay.
61	00:05:22	00:05:24	Okay, um...
62	00:05:24	00:05:25	wouldn't, how about this.
63	00:05:25	00:05:31	Since it would be pretty risky for the killer to tamper with evidence during a full-on investigation in the Lab... Mm-hmm.
64	00:05:31	00:05:37	let's just say, for the purposes of this exercise, that can't happen.
65	00:05:37	00:05:38	Okay.
66	00:05:38	00:05:39	Now what?
67	00:05:39	00:05:41	That's up to you.
68	00:05:41	00:05:43	You have the setup.
69	00:05:43	00:05:45	You run the investigation from here.
70	00:05:45	00:05:46	Simple Q &amp; A. You ask, I answer.
71	00:05:46	00:05:47	Truthfully?
72	00:05:48	00:05:49	Absolutely.
73	00:05:49	00:05:51	No lying-- call that a rule.
74	00:05:51	00:05:56	Well, what if I get close to actually figuring it out, you're not just gonna change who did it or something like that?
75	00:05:56	00:05:58	No revisionism-- also a rule.
76	00:05:58	00:06:01	For something that's not a game it sure does have a lot of rules.
77	00:06:01	00:06:02	You want to do this or not?
78	00:06:02	00:06:04	All right.
79	00:06:04	00:06:06	Okay.
80	00:06:06	00:06:13	I guess the first thing that I would do would be to examine the actual bomb mechanism to see if there's any clue as to who might have built it.
81	00:06:13	00:06:15	Good idea.
82	00:06:15	00:06:16	Because there are a lot of clues.
83	00:06:23	00:06:30	Chemicals have been sent to Trace for I.D., but the bomb appears to be a binary explosive.
84	00:06:30	00:06:34	Killer hides the loaded brick amongst the others...
85	00:06:35	00:06:38	A little pressure arms it...
86	00:06:38	00:06:44	Liquid A in ampoule mixes with solid B, creating an unstable chemical explosive...
87	00:06:44	00:06:47	all you need to do is move it.
88	00:07:09	00:07:11	Ooh, I have an idea.
89	00:07:11	00:07:12	What?
90	00:07:12	00:07:14	What about the blasting cap?
91	00:07:14	00:07:16	Ah, well, what do you know?
92	00:07:16	00:07:18	The leg wires are color coded.
93	00:07:18	00:07:21	Good, 'cause the color coding is manufacturer specific.
94	00:07:21	00:07:23	So now we can track down the source.
95	00:07:23	00:07:24	Indeed we could.
96	00:07:24	00:07:26	Hey, people. What's going on?
97	00:07:26	00:07:27	Nothing.
98	00:07:27	00:07:29	You look... better.
99	00:07:32	00:07:42	Let's say you learn that LVPD recently seized one dozen commercial grade blasting caps in an arson-explosives raid, and that the Lab was processing the case evidence.
100	00:07:42	00:07:45	Well, then, I know exactly where I'd go next...
101	00:07:45	00:07:47	'Course I know where those blasting caps are.
102	00:07:47	00:07:49	They're right in here.
103	00:07:49	00:07:50	No, no, no, no, no.
104	00:07:50	00:07:51	Not so fast, cowboy.
105	00:07:51	00:07:54	Give me those keys.
106	00:08:14	00:08:17	Looks like you're one blasting cap shy, Bob.
107	00:08:17	00:08:19	That's not possible.
108	00:08:20	00:08:22	Wait...
109	00:08:22	00:08:26	Y'all don't think I had something to do with...
110	00:08:28	00:08:29	Are there any prints on the lock?
111	00:08:29	00:08:32	Excuse me, we're-- Playing a murder game.
112	00:08:32	00:08:33	I know, I get it.
113	00:08:33	00:08:34	I wanna play.
114	00:08:34	00:08:36	He says it's not a game.
115	00:08:36	00:08:37	Well, I wanna play anyway.
116	00:08:37	00:08:39	No. Why not?
117	00:08:39	00:08:40	You're the dead guy.
118	00:08:40	00:08:41	Oh.
119	00:08:42	00:08:44	Well, then I'd have a vested interest in the outcome then, wouldn't I?
120	00:08:44	00:08:47	Oh, come on, I'll fill him in as we go along.
121	00:08:47	00:08:50	Fine.
122	00:08:50	00:08:52	Yup. So.
123	00:08:52	00:08:53	Are there any prints on the lock?
124	00:08:54	00:08:56	No, no prints.
125	00:08:57	00:09:00	Looks like this lock's been slipped.
126	00:09:07	00:09:11	So somebody stole the blasting cap from Ballistics to make it look like Bobby did it.
127	00:09:11	00:09:13	Nefarious, don't you think?
128	00:09:13	00:09:15	What about the chemicals that were used to make the explosive?
129	00:09:15	00:09:18	Did we get anything back from Trace?
130	00:09:20	00:09:22	You always get something from Trace.
131	00:09:22	00:09:27	The explosive was liquid nitro-acetate and solid ammonium nitrate packed in baking soda.
132	00:09:27	00:09:29	To blend in with the rest of the cocaine bricks.
133	00:09:29	00:09:30	Cute.
134	00:09:31	00:09:33	Explosive liquids are generally pretty volatile.
135	00:09:33	00:09:37	Did you ask Hodges if nitro-acetate has any special storage requirements?
136	00:09:37	00:09:38	It needs to be refrigerated.
137	00:09:38	00:09:40	Yeah, he said it needed to be refrigerated.
138	00:09:40	00:09:42	Well, there's only so many refrigerators in the Lab.
139	00:09:42	00:09:44	Maybe where can get us to who.
140	00:10:03	00:10:05	What are you guys looking for?
141	00:10:05	00:10:07	I'm sorry, we can't tell you that, Henry.
142	00:10:07	00:10:09	Nitrogen tetra-hydride...
143	00:10:13	00:10:14	Sodium nitrate.
144	00:10:14	00:10:16	Wait, what happens when you mix those two compounds?
145	00:10:16	00:10:18	They produce nitro-acetate.
146	00:10:18	00:10:20	That's a high explosive binary, Henry.
147	00:10:20	00:10:21	Really?
148	00:10:21	00:10:22	I didn't know that.
149	00:10:22	00:10:28	Look, just 'cause I have those compounds in my fridge doesn't mean I used them to make nitro-acetate.
150	00:10:28	00:10:30	You can't prove that.
151	00:10:30	00:10:34	Baking soda was used to conceal the explosive, smartass.
152	00:10:34	00:10:36	It's also used to absorb odors.
153	00:10:36	00:10:38	Nice smell is a priority of my life.
154	00:10:38	00:10:43	I think the baking soda was used to absorb a lot more than odors, Henry.
155	00:11:10	00:11:12	Okay, I confess, I did it!
156	00:11:12	00:11:14	Henry?
157	00:11:14	00:11:15	Why would Henry kill me?
158	00:11:16	00:11:18	We're not supposed to care about the why.
159	00:11:19	00:11:20	Whatever.
160	00:11:23	00:11:24	...with us for that.
161	00:11:24	00:11:25	Hey, fellas. Hey.
162	00:11:26	00:11:27	Thanks for giving me justice at least.
163	00:11:27	00:11:29	Yeah, you're welcome.
164	00:11:29	00:11:32	Man, I don't know if I'm more tired or hungry right now.
165	00:11:33	00:11:34	You wanna get something to eat? Yeah.
166	00:11:34	00:11:37	Actually, I felt like a little Pai Gow or some Blackjack.
167	00:11:37	00:11:38	Let's hit the Strip.
168	00:11:38	00:11:40	After the shift we just pulled? Yeah.
169	00:11:40	00:11:42	I just drank one of those energy drinks.
170	00:11:42	00:11:44	I probably won't sleep for another couple hours.
171	00:11:44	00:11:45	I don't think so, man.
172	00:11:45	00:11:47	Maybe another time, huh?
173	00:11:47	00:11:48	All right.
174	00:11:48	00:11:50	I'll catch ya later.
175	00:11:53	00:11:54	All right, Grissom.
176	00:11:54	00:11:56	That's it for me. I'm out of here.
177	00:11:56	00:11:58	Have a nice day.
178	00:12:00	00:12:03	Yeah, I'm going over to Frank's to grab something to eat.
179	00:12:03	00:12:07	I'll probably be there for at least an hour if you want to... if you want to join me.
180	00:12:09	00:12:12	You know, we don't have to talk about anything in particular.
181	00:12:12	00:12:15	Just two guys having breakfast.
182	00:12:15	00:12:18	I just don't think it's good for people to be alone too much.
183	00:12:19	00:12:22	If you want to, cool. If not, cool.
184	00:12:22	00:12:23	Whatever.
185	00:12:28	00:12:29	Hi.
186	00:12:34	00:12:36	Rack 'em up.
187	00:12:36	00:12:37	Excuse me?
188	00:12:37	00:12:39	Well, word on campus is, there's a murder game going on.
189	00:12:39	00:12:41	Oh, no, no, no, it's not a game.
190	00:12:41	00:12:43	It's a thought experiment.
191	00:12:43	00:12:46	Sounds like the late Archie Johnson has a big mouth.
192	00:12:46	00:12:49	Come on, please, it's been really slow at Prints all day.
193	00:12:49	00:12:50	Who we killin'?
194	00:12:52	00:12:56	Henry, I need the tox on that lady, um...
195	00:12:58	00:13:01	Henry!
196	00:13:07	00:13:09	No sign of sexual trauma.
197	00:13:09	00:13:11	Thank God for small favors.
198	00:13:11	00:13:16	You know, David, our job is never easy, but this is a colleague.
199	00:13:16	00:13:20	If your emotions are too raw and you feel you need to excuse yourself...
200	00:13:20	00:13:21	Look. (crunching)
201	00:13:22	00:13:23	He's crunchy.
202	00:13:23	00:13:25	Um... (crunching)
203	00:13:33	00:13:35	Frozen sweat stains. Yuck.
204	00:13:35	00:13:40	He was trapped in a small space at minus ten degrees centigrade.
205	00:13:40	00:13:45	So it's fair to assume he was exerting himself in a state of mind-numbing terror.
206	00:13:45	00:13:48	How long do you think he was stuck in there?
207	00:13:50	00:13:51	Well, several hours at least.
208	00:13:52	00:13:55	Time of exposure in extreme cold is difficult to gauge physiologically.
209	00:13:56	00:14:02	Why don't you let me know when he softens up and we'll start cutting.
210	00:14:02	00:14:04	So we're just going to wait for him to thaw?
211	00:14:04	00:14:07	What do you want me to do, stick him in a microwave?
212	00:14:12	00:14:13	Ooh...
213	00:14:14	00:14:16	Hot... hot, hot, hot.
214	00:14:16	00:14:19	So, then, okay, Henry froze to death.
215	00:14:19	00:14:21	Well, maybe not.
216	00:14:21	00:14:25	Because if the autopsy hasn't been performed yet, then we can't be sure that's COD.
217	00:14:25	00:14:27	Well played, Simms.
218	00:14:27	00:14:31	So it takes a few turns for the autopsy results to get back. Turns?
219	00:14:31	00:14:32	Hours. A few hours.
220	00:14:32	00:14:36	So, while you're waiting for the autopsy results, what do you do in the meantime?
221	00:14:36	00:14:38	Well, the CSIs would process the freezer.
222	00:14:39	00:14:40	Did they find anything?
223	00:14:40	00:14:42	A virtual cornucopia.
224	00:14:53	00:15:04	The condition of the interior could be the result of a struggle, or the simple, understandable panic of a man trapped inside a freezer.
225	00:15:04	00:15:18	In any event, the emergency release handle appears to have been bent and rendered inoperative, and several chemical containers broken in the process possibly releasing chloroform and methyl ethyl ketone into the space.
226	00:15:18	00:15:22	I'm sending samples to Trace to confirm.
227	00:15:24	00:15:26	Trace.
228	00:15:26	00:15:29	Is there anything you can't do?
229	00:15:29	00:15:29	Hodges.
230	00:15:29	00:15:30	Sorry.
231	00:15:41	00:15:45	This could be a case of lab geek humor gone wrong.
232	00:16:00	00:16:02	Hello?
233	00:16:02	00:16:04	Hello!
234	00:16:04	00:16:07	Hello?! It's not funny!
235	00:16:17	00:16:19	Oh, my God.
236	00:16:19	00:16:21	Oh, my God. Oh, my God, help!
237	00:16:24	00:16:26	Help me!
238	00:16:26	00:16:28	Please help!
239	00:16:28	00:16:34	So the merry prankster comes back later, sees the joke gone bad, then he just yanks the pin and scrams.
240	00:16:34	00:16:38	You said that the emergency release plunger was bent.
241	00:16:38	00:16:39	Mm-hmm.
242	00:16:39	00:16:41	Well, that thing is made of solid steel.
243	00:16:41	00:16:42	How could Henry do that?
244	00:16:42	00:16:45	Adrenaline kicks in when he finally realizes that he's dying.
245	00:16:45	00:16:50	So, maybe in the moment of crisis, Henry has the strength of ten men.
246	00:16:50	00:16:52	Ten small men.
247	00:16:53	00:16:55	Maybe.
248	00:16:55	00:16:56	That word always looks so good on a case report.
249	00:16:57	00:17:00	Was there any evidence on the handle on the outside of the freezer?
250	00:17:00	00:17:01	Just a schmear.
251	00:17:02	00:17:10	Sugar, soy protein, partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, roasted nuts.
252	00:17:10	00:17:11	Peanut butter?
253	00:17:11	00:17:13	Well, killer's got to eat, too.
254	00:17:13	00:17:18	So, CSIs would check every trash can and every bio hazard disposal unit in the whole Lab.
255	00:17:18	00:17:21	Yes, the would, and they would find...
256	00:17:25	00:17:26	What, no jelly?
257	00:17:26	00:17:28	We found the peanut butter from inside your glove.
258	00:17:28	00:17:32	It matches the stuff we found on the freezer door handle.
259	00:17:32	00:17:33	Chunky, right?
260	00:17:34	00:17:35	I didn't kill Henry.
261	00:17:35	00:17:37	Well, not on purpose.
262	00:17:37	00:17:39	No, not even by accident.
263	00:17:39	00:17:45	I only had a couple of minutes for lunch, and I had a bunch of photo emulsion sheets that needed to be stored.
264	00:17:45	00:17:47	And I store them in the freezer.
265	00:17:47	00:17:50	You seem very tense.
266	00:17:50	00:17:53	You know, I don't really like being persecuted.
267	00:17:53	00:17:55	Yeah.
268	00:17:57	00:18:00	Get used to it, punk.
269	00:18:00	00:18:01	No, I don't know about that.
270	00:18:01	00:18:03	What? Well, Bobby's a gun guy.
271	00:18:03	00:18:05	Gun guys shoot people.
272	00:18:05	00:18:06	Gun guys don't shoot people.
273	00:18:06	00:18:07	People shoot people.
274	00:18:08	00:18:12	Actually, bullets shoot people, shot from guns which are usually in the hands of gun guys.
275	00:18:12	00:18:14	Can we get the autopsy results?
276	00:18:14	00:18:16	Well, I guess Henry's had enough time to defrost.
277	00:18:16	00:18:19	COD was not, in fact, due to hypothermia.
278	00:18:19	00:18:21	Ooh, wait, no, I can guess what they found in Tox.
279	00:18:21	00:18:22	It was chloroform.
280	00:18:22	00:18:23	Nope.
281	00:18:23	00:18:24	Methyl ethyl ether?
282	00:18:24	00:18:25	PCP.
283	00:18:25	00:18:26	What?
284	00:18:26	00:18:28	Massive, overdose amounts of PCP.
285	00:18:28	00:18:32	Commonly known as phencyclidine, or angel dust.
286	00:18:32	00:18:42	PCP blocks the brain's NMDA receptors, hypothalamus goes nuts, resulting in anxiety, confusion, and fever-like overheating.
287	00:18:44	00:18:48	So Henry goes into the cooler to cool off...
288	00:18:48	00:18:54	And with the PCP stimulating his adrenal glands, he has the strength of the Incredible Hulk.
289	00:18:58	00:18:59	A duster?
290	00:18:59	00:19:00	You made me a lousy duster?
291	00:19:00	00:19:02	That is totally bogus.
292	00:19:02	00:19:11	Aside from the 10,000 other reasons why I'd be crazy to even try that junk, if I were a closet PCP freak, I wouldn't do it in the Lab.
293	00:19:11	00:19:12	That's very professional.
294	00:19:12	00:19:16	Archie told me about your sick little thought experiment, and I want to play.
295	00:19:16	00:19:19	But I still can't believe, even hypothetically, you'd do something like this to me.
296	00:19:19	00:19:22	Well, Henry, I hypothetically called your mother and I explained everything.
297	00:19:22	00:19:25	That woman is a crier.
298	00:19:25	00:19:30	Your autopsy didn't mention powder in his nasal passages or PCP damage in his lungs.
299	00:19:30	00:19:31	That's because it wasn't there.
300	00:19:31	00:19:32	So Henry didn't inhale it, or smoke it, or snort it?
301	00:19:32	00:19:35	No, he didn't.
302	00:19:35	00:19:37	Then how did the PCP get into my system?
303	00:19:37	00:19:39	You tell me.
304	00:19:41	00:19:42	Oh!
305	00:19:42	00:19:44	Crusty pits.
306	00:19:44	00:19:47	Sweat stains.
307	00:19:47	00:19:51	You said that Henry's lab coat had big sweat stains on the collar and on the armpits.
308	00:19:51	00:19:53	So that's it-- somebody dosed the coat.
309	00:20:08	00:20:12	Lab coat tests positive for PCP.
310	00:20:12	00:20:17	Combined with body heat and sweat, the drug must've entered his system transdermally.
311	00:20:17	00:20:20	Like a nicotine patch from hell.
312	00:20:20	00:20:24	Well, Henry would've died of an overdose no matter what.
313	00:20:24	00:20:31	So, all the trapping him in the freezer with the chemicals spilling, that was all completely incidental.
314	00:20:31	00:20:33	It was the logical outcome of the initial crime.
315	00:20:33	00:20:35	And it's quite funny.
316	00:20:35	00:20:35	Hey.
317	00:20:35	00:20:38	Well, we're not done yet.
318	00:20:38	00:20:40	Who did the deed?
319	00:20:40	00:20:44	Well, taking lab coats off the premises is against regulations.
320	00:20:44	00:20:48	So the PCP would've had to have been applied in the Lab, right under our noses.
321	00:20:48	00:20:49	And that stuff reeks.
322	00:20:49	00:20:52	I have to crank my fume hood up full whenever I work with it, I still go home with a headache.
323	00:20:52	00:20:56	Fume hoods. There's fume hoods in the Garage, and DNA and Trace.
324	00:20:57	00:20:58	So we would have to test all the sinks for PCP.
325	00:20:58	00:20:59	Excellent.
326	00:20:59	00:21:00	That's a good approach.
327	00:21:12	00:21:13	But you would find nothing.
328	00:21:13	00:21:14	Really?
329	00:21:15	00:21:17	Yeah, there's no trace of PCP in any of sinks.
330	00:21:17	00:21:19	Squeaky clean.
331	00:21:19	00:21:20	Damn it.
332	00:21:33	00:21:35	Oh! Wait.
333	00:21:35	00:21:38	I got it, check the plant.
334	00:21:38	00:21:40	You got it.
335	00:21:43	00:21:46	The killer cleaned up, but he left one witness.
336	00:21:56	00:21:57	Wendy.
337	00:21:57	00:21:58	Me?
338	00:21:58	00:22:00	Oh, drat.
339	00:22:00	00:22:02	Well, it's not a slow day for me after all.
340	00:22:02	00:22:05	Ecklie wants me to pick up the backlog from Swing.
341	00:22:05	00:22:07	Somebody please tell me who dies next.
342	00:22:07	00:22:08	And how. Thank you.
343	00:22:08	00:22:10	So...
344	00:22:10	00:22:12	You got time for one more?
345	00:22:12	00:22:13	Well, someone's having fun.
346	00:22:13	00:22:14	Maybe a little.
347	00:22:14	00:22:16	You're not bad at this.
348	00:22:16	00:22:18	Thanks.
349	00:22:18	00:22:20	I've been thinking about taking the CSI field test.
350	00:22:20	00:22:22	This is actually really good theory and practice for me.
351	00:22:22	00:22:24	The field test?
352	00:22:24	00:22:25	Yeah.
353	00:22:25	00:22:27	What?
354	00:22:27	00:22:27	Why?
355	00:22:27	00:22:28	Nothing.
356	00:22:28	00:22:29	Nothing?
357	00:22:29	00:22:30	That's right.
358	00:22:30	00:22:32	A great big pile of nothing.
359	00:22:32	00:22:33	From me, to you.
360	00:22:35	00:22:37	Oh, hey.
361	00:22:37	00:22:38	How are you?
362	00:22:38	00:22:40	Why?
363	00:22:40	00:22:41	I can't ask how you're doing?
364	00:22:41	00:22:43	I'm sorry.
365	00:22:43	00:22:45	I've just had a lot of, uh...
366	00:22:45	00:22:46	I've been busy.
367	00:22:46	00:22:47	Oh.
368	00:22:47	00:22:51	Well, maybe you should take a few days off, for once in your career.
369	00:22:51	00:22:53	I mean, you've got enough stored up.
370	00:22:53	00:22:56	Go after her.
371	00:22:56	00:22:58	It's not what she wants.
372	00:22:58	00:23:00	What do you want?
373	00:23:00	00:23:03	I want her to be happy.
374	00:23:04	00:23:05	Field Agent Simms.
375	00:23:05	00:23:07	Stop it.
376	00:23:07	00:23:09	Hey, I think it's got a nice ring to it. Thank you.
377	00:23:09	00:23:12	Here she comes, flashing her badge, taking down perps.
378	00:23:12	00:23:15	Why is even potential advancement so threatening to you?
379	00:23:15	00:23:17	Hey, Sanders left the lab, he got his ass kicked.
380	00:23:17	00:23:18	I'm just saying.
381	00:23:20	00:23:22	All right, come on, let's do another one.
382	00:23:22	00:23:23	Okay. Fine.
383	00:23:23	00:23:26	Let's.
384	00:23:42	00:23:45	Well, now, that's a little passive-aggressive, don't you think?
385	00:24:05	00:24:07	No kidding.
386	00:24:17	00:24:21	It appears as though the vic struck the edge of the table.
387	00:24:28	00:24:30	The evidence on the floor is...
388	00:24:31	00:24:33	well, evidence.
389	00:24:33	00:24:35	Brown paper bindle must have opened when it fell.
390	00:24:35	00:24:39	Looks like the contents of a woman's purse.
391	00:24:39	00:24:41	And here's the vic's other shoe.
392	00:24:41	00:24:45	Square toe, low heel, stylish but affordable.
393	00:24:45	00:24:47	Flirty, not whory.
394	00:24:47	00:24:48	You will be missed.
395	00:24:48	00:24:52	There's an oily residue on the sole.
396	00:25:05	00:25:08	The evidence appears to lead to an inescapable conclusion.
397	00:25:08	00:25:14	This tragedy might have just simply been the result of an accident in the workplace.
398	00:25:14	00:25:16	I fell off a ladder?
399	00:25:16	00:25:18	Well, you are kind of little clumsy.
400	00:25:18	00:25:19	Since when?
401	00:25:19	00:25:20	It's endearing.
402	00:25:20	00:25:23	Are you satisfied with the explanation?
403	00:25:23	00:25:24	Uh, no.
404	00:25:24	00:25:26	What about the oily residue on the ladder?
405	00:25:26	00:25:31	There are bristles in the oil, which means that somebody brushed it on.
406	00:25:31	00:25:33	What exactly is the oily stuff?
407	00:25:33	00:25:35	Well, thank God...
408	00:25:35	00:25:37	...for trace analysis.
409	00:25:37	00:25:39	Hmm.
410	00:25:39	00:25:54	Hodges, who is a genius and tragically underpaid, used the powers of his brilliant mind and the scientific method to discover that the oil that was brushed on the ladder was a Teflon-based two-part oil.
411	00:25:54	00:25:56	A gun lubricant.
412	00:25:56	00:25:58	So?
413	00:25:58	00:26:01	So you're the gun guy, Bobby.
414	00:26:01	00:26:05	Yeah, which is exactly why I would never use Teflon-based two-part oil.
415	00:26:05	00:26:08	Real gun guys hate that stuff.
416	00:26:08	00:26:11	If it separates in the can, it separates in the gun.
417	00:26:11	00:26:13	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
418	00:26:13	00:26:14	Whoa. You are tense.
419	00:26:14	00:26:15	So, where do you think you're going?
420	00:26:15	00:26:16	Back to work.
421	00:26:17	00:26:18	This is ridiculous. Oh.
422	00:26:18	00:26:21	Sit down.
423	00:26:23	00:26:24	Ow!
424	00:26:24	00:26:27	No, no. Captain Brass is not the kind of cop who smacks a suspect around.
425	00:26:28	00:26:29	Really? Scares me.
426	00:26:31	00:26:34	Oh, well, look who's the clumsy one now.
427	00:26:34	00:26:36	Excuse me.
428	00:26:36	00:26:40	Okay, so we don't have nearly enough to hold Bobby, right?
429	00:26:40	00:26:41	No.
430	00:26:44	00:26:45	All right.
431	00:26:45	00:26:47	Who's up for an autopsy?
432	00:26:48	00:26:56	The carotid-jugular complex was transected, and based on the placement and size of the wound, I'd say she had at...
433	00:26:56	00:26:59	Hey, it's a neck wound.
434	00:27:02	00:27:08	Based on the placement and size of the neck wound, she was conscious 30 to 60 seconds before blood loss was fatal.
435	00:27:08	00:27:10	That's a long time.
436	00:27:10	00:27:13	No one reported her screaming or calling out for help.
437	00:27:13	00:27:14	We have to get back to the case file.
438	00:27:19	00:27:23	There was no blood on her hands at the scene.
439	00:27:24	00:27:28	Unless she was unconscious, she would have at least tried to stop the bleeding.
440	00:27:28	00:27:29	Well, there was no blow to the head.
441	00:27:29	00:27:31	Do you think it's possible she was dead before she hit the table?
442	00:27:31	00:27:34	You mean like a cardiac event?
443	00:27:34	00:27:39	I can't rule that out, but a healthy, 36-year-old having a heart attack?
444	00:27:39	00:27:42	35 in October, thank you very much.
445	00:27:46	00:27:49	She has a oval, perimortem burn on her wrist.
446	00:27:49	00:27:50	Wait a second. That's familiar.
447	00:28:06	00:28:10	Singed right off her barely 35-year-old wrist.
448	00:28:10	00:28:12	That bracelet wasn't old evidence.
449	00:28:12	00:28:13	I was wearing it.
450	00:28:13	00:28:15	Correct.
451	00:28:15	00:28:19	So, what melts silver and stops your heart at the same time?
452	00:28:19	00:28:21	A bolt of lightning.
453	00:28:21	00:28:22	In the lab.
454	00:28:22	00:28:23	Electrocution.
455	00:28:23	00:28:24	From what?
456	00:28:24	00:28:26	Something in the Evidence Locker.
457	00:28:55	00:28:59	There was a motorcycle battery in the ventilation duct?
458	00:28:59	00:29:03	Wired to the ladder and the evidence box?
459	00:29:03	00:29:05	Precisely.
460	00:29:13	00:29:15	Devilishly clever, wouldn't you say?
461	00:29:15	00:29:16	No.
462	00:29:16	00:29:18	Well, who's the killer, Wile E. Coyote?
463	00:29:18	00:29:21	It's ridiculous!
464	00:29:21	00:29:23	Anyone could have walked in there.
465	00:29:23	00:29:24	So, what, the victim's just random?
466	00:29:24	00:29:25	Uh, no.
467	00:29:26	00:29:28	How'd the killer get me up there in the first place?
468	00:29:28	00:29:33	What did he do, pass me in the hall and say, Hey, Wendy, go climb up that ladder and check out the case evidence you had absolutely nothing to do with?
469	00:29:33	00:29:36	Not in those words exactly, but, uh, yeah.
470	00:29:36	00:29:37	That's completely unverifiable.
471	00:29:37	00:29:38	This is so lame.
472	00:29:38	00:29:41	Scenario requires further revision.
473	00:29:41	00:29:42	Okay, what is that?
474	00:29:42	00:29:44	Nothing.
475	00:29:48	00:29:49	Is that a tape recorder?
476	00:29:49	00:29:51	You are so paranoid.
477	00:29:51	00:29:56	This thought experiment has now concluded. Thank you.
478	00:30:02	00:30:03	Why were you recording us?
479	00:30:03	00:30:06	I wasn't recording you.
480	00:30:06	00:30:08	Why would I record you? That makes no sense.
481	00:30:15	00:30:19	Lab Rats.
482	00:30:19	00:30:20	The Game of Science and Murder.
483	00:30:20	00:30:22	It's a prototype.
484	00:30:22	00:30:25	Two to four players, ages eight and up.
485	00:30:25	00:30:27	You're making a board game?
486	00:30:27	00:30:30	Well, it's not just a board game.
487	00:30:30	00:30:32	Gets people to think.
488	00:30:32	00:30:33	Why were you recording us?
489	00:30:34	00:30:42	I needed your help to flesh out scenarios, and I figured that if I hid the recorder, your answers would be candid and honest.
490	00:30:42	00:30:44	Look, see.
491	00:30:47	00:30:53	It's like Clue, only CSI-ier.
492	00:30:55	00:30:56	Hodges, this is, uh...
493	00:30:57	00:30:58	This is kind of impressive.
494	00:31:00	00:31:05	In a painfully sad, geek type of way.
495	00:31:05	00:31:12	Well, painfully sad geeks have a lot of spare time on their hands and loads of disposable income.
496	00:31:12	00:31:14	Lab Rats could be a gold mine.
497	00:31:18	00:31:20	Oh!
498	00:31:20	00:31:22	Little Lab Techs.
499	00:31:22	00:31:23	Mm-hmm.
500	00:31:26	00:31:30	Sandy Baxter, fingerprint fanatic.
501	00:31:30	00:31:35	Reggie Chang, eagled-eyed A/V expert.
502	00:31:35	00:31:38	Andrew Henries, top-notch tox tech.
503	00:31:38	00:31:42	Hodgkins.
504	00:31:42	00:31:43	Hodgkins.
505	00:31:43	00:31:45	Mm-hmm.
506	00:31:45	00:31:46	You named yourself after cancer.
507	00:31:50	00:31:52	Oh!
508	00:31:54	00:32:00	Mindy Bimms, the clumsy yet buxom DNA tech.
509	00:32:06	00:32:08	Clumsy yet buxom?
510	00:32:08	00:32:12	It's a redeeming feature.
511	00:32:13	00:32:15	It's-It's a prototype.
512	00:32:15	00:32:21	So, tell me, do you think that Mindy Bimms is clumsy because she's top-heavy?
513	00:32:23	00:32:26	Or do you just mean clumsy like this?
514	00:32:26	00:32:29	Oops.
515	00:32:32	00:32:35	Okay, are you... are you allergic to being honest with me?
516	00:32:35	00:32:40	'Cause the thing is, if you had actually asked me to help you with this game, I would have.
517	00:32:41	00:32:47	But, no, you had to hide a tape recorder under a table and engage us all in this great big thought experiment!
518	00:32:47	00:32:54	When in reality, it doesn't even matter, apparently, what I think because I'm just Mindy Big Boobs to you, and I...
519	00:32:54	00:32:56	You are the dumbest smart guy I know.
520	00:32:56	00:32:58	You think I'm smart?
521	00:33:09	00:33:10	Night, Greg.
522	00:33:10	00:33:12	Yeah, whatever.
523	00:33:14	00:33:17	Oh, Hodges, I'm so sorry.
524	00:33:17	00:33:19	It's just that I'm jealous of your intellect.
525	00:33:19	00:33:21	But Wendy, you have so much to live for.
526	00:33:21	00:33:24	Don't do it. You're too close to the edge.
527	00:33:24	00:33:26	Oh, and now I'm drowning! Oh, God!
528	00:33:26	00:33:27	Oh, God, help me.
529	00:33:27	00:33:28	Help me.
530	00:33:30	00:33:32	What are you doing?
531	00:33:32	00:33:34	Oh, uh...
532	00:33:37	00:33:49	I was, uh, just trying to... develop a board game based on this place, but not in any legally actionable sense.
533	00:33:49	00:33:53	You get evidence, scenarios, analysis.
534	00:33:53	00:33:57	Try to solve diabolical murders.
535	00:34:09	00:34:11	I like games.
536	00:34:11	00:34:12	Really?
537	00:34:12	00:34:14	Yeah.
538	00:34:14	00:34:18	Okay. Let's play.
539	00:34:22	00:34:24	What makes it hard to catch a killer?
540	00:34:24	00:34:31	Is it the sheer destructive power of the murder itself that obliterates evidence as it snuffs out life?
541	00:34:38	00:34:43	Or is it the chain of events the murder sets into motion which obscure the true crime?
542	00:34:49	00:34:51	That was good.
543	00:34:52	00:34:59	Or is it a mechanism so complex and diabolical that it borders on the incredible?
544	00:34:59	00:35:05	In truth, it is all these things, and all these things are the same.
545	00:35:06	00:35:11	Because the only real way to catch a killer, is to outsmart him.
546	00:35:11	00:35:14	And hope that he's not smarter than you.
547	00:35:26	00:35:32	So you're rehearsing your speech in front of your computer, and you take a bullet to the head.
548	00:35:32	00:35:33	No witnesses.
549	00:35:33	00:35:36	Nobody heard the shot, and the killer is somebody in the Lab.
550	00:35:37	00:35:38	Am I eligible?
551	00:35:38	00:35:40	In this scenario, no.
552	00:35:40	00:35:42	Okay.
553	00:35:42	00:35:46	So during the basic process of the scene, what do I find?
554	00:35:47	00:35:52	A single nine millimeter casing at the doorway to Trace.
555	00:35:55	00:35:59	Then my first blush theory is a walk-by.
556	00:36:08	00:36:09	I'm going to need the bullet.
557	00:36:09	00:36:11	Then I'm going to need an autopsy.
558	00:36:19	00:36:22	Get it out of your system. No sign of sexual trauma.
559	00:36:23	00:36:25	Out! Now!
560	00:36:32	00:36:42	All right, trajectory of the shot was roughly 90 degrees from vertical, straight through his noble skull.
561	00:36:42	00:36:43	Bullet didn't exit.
562	00:36:43	00:36:44	Is it intact?
563	00:36:48	00:36:50	More or less.
564	00:36:50	00:36:51	IBIS.
565	00:36:51	00:36:55	The bullet's nose is significantly deformed and the lead base is pitted.
566	00:36:55	00:37:01	But there are sufficient striae to get a match for what little it's worth.
567	00:37:31	00:37:38	The gun came through the lab about a week ago in a buyback program, and was subsequently destroyed.
568	00:37:38	00:37:42	So you were shot by a weapon that no longer exists.
569	00:37:42	00:37:44	Apparently.
570	00:37:45	00:37:48	Okay, let's go over your snuff film, shall we?
571	00:37:48	00:37:51	I want to see exactly what you did.
572	00:37:53	00:37:58	In truth, it is all of these things, and all of these things are the same.
573	00:38:00	00:38:08	Because the only real way to catch a killer, is to outsmart him and hope that he is not smarter than you.
574	00:38:14	00:38:15	Do it again. Do it again.
575	00:38:15	00:38:16	One more time. One more time.
576	00:38:16	00:38:17	Wait, wait, wait-- they all want to watch?
577	00:38:18	00:38:20	Professional curiosity.
578	00:38:20	00:38:22	I guess.
579	00:38:23	00:38:28	In truth, it is all these things, and all these things are the same.
580	00:38:28	00:38:36	Because the only real way to catch a killer, is to outsmart him and hope that he is not smarter than you.
581	00:38:47	00:38:54	You took the shot straight into your head, but according to the video, you were not facing the hallway.
582	00:38:54	00:38:56	Which means the bullet didn't come from there.
583	00:38:57	00:38:59	It must've come from here.
584	00:39:01	00:39:03	Yes, it did.
585	00:39:10	00:39:13	A zip gun.
586	00:39:13	00:39:15	With an unrifled barrel.
587	00:39:16	00:39:18	And a remote trigger.
588	00:39:18	00:39:20	What model year is the pager?
589	00:39:20	00:39:21	Pre 1990.
590	00:39:22	00:39:24	So no call-back numbers.
591	00:39:24	00:39:26	Pre-1990 pagers didn't store them.
592	00:39:26	00:39:30	So, you're at a dead end?
593	00:39:30	00:39:32	I'm just getting started.
594	00:39:44	00:39:48	Do I have to walk over to the GCMS or will you just tell me?
595	00:39:48	00:39:52	The barrel of the zip gun contains traces of black powder.
596	00:39:54	00:40:02	Okay, but the bullet was pitted on the base, which is the result of exposure to smokeless gunpowder.
597	00:40:02	00:40:07	Which means that the bullet that killed you was fired twice.
598	00:40:08	00:40:15	The killer test fires the gun, knowing it will be destroyed, and keeps the bullet and the casing.
599	00:40:17	00:40:21	He puts the bullet in a metal tube on a wad of black powder.
600	00:40:21	00:40:24	With a pager trigger, it's essentially a remote controlled musket.
601	00:40:24	00:40:28	Call the number from any phone or through the internet and...
602	00:40:31	00:40:33	Impressive.
603	00:40:33	00:40:34	Can you tell me whodunit?
604	00:40:34	00:40:40	Well, Bobby Dawson is an early 19th century firearm enthusiast.
605	00:40:40	00:40:42	He, uh, loads and fires muskets for fun.
606	00:40:42	00:40:44	Oh, yeah.
607	00:40:44	00:40:46	Big gun guy.
608	00:40:46	00:40:48	I didn't do it!
609	00:40:48	00:40:50	I didn't do anything!
610	00:40:50	00:40:51	I swear!
611	00:40:51	00:40:53	Hey!
612	00:40:53	00:40:54	Whoa.
613	00:40:54	00:40:55	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
614	00:40:58	00:40:59	Gun.
615	00:41:09	00:41:11	What do you got against Bobby Dawson?
616	00:41:11	00:41:13	Nothing.
617	00:41:13	00:41:15	Running gag.
618	00:41:15	00:41:18	So, you think Bobby Dawson did it?
619	00:41:18	00:41:20	No.
620	00:41:20	00:41:22	Bobby was framed.
621	00:41:22	00:41:24	You drew me a map.
622	00:41:24	00:41:33	The path of the bullet, if not stopped by your brain mass, would have continued straight through into ballistics.
623	00:41:33	00:41:34	Where Bobby works.
624	00:41:34	00:41:41	Now, Bobby's a real gun guy, and no gun guy would ever position himself down-range of a shot.
625	00:41:43	00:41:45	You're more than a victim, Hodges.
626	00:41:47	00:41:51	According to your video, you straightened up just before the fatal shot was fired.
627	00:41:51	00:41:53	You knew it was coming.
628	00:41:53	00:41:56	And you made sure that you were in the perfect position to catch it.
629	00:41:56	00:42:00	I am a mere Padawan in the presence of the Jedi Master.
630	00:42:00	00:42:02	True.
631	00:42:04	00:42:06	Let's play another.
632	00:42:06	00:42:08	Sure.
633	00:42:12	00:42:15	You weren't ready.
634	00:42:15	00:42:18	To leave.
635	00:42:18	00:42:19	This.
636	00:42:19	00:42:23	The challenges, the puzzles, the job.
637	00:42:23	00:42:25	No.
638	00:42:26	00:42:28	But Sara was.
639	00:42:30	00:42:33	Yeah, she was.
640	00:42:33	00:42:35	You can't stand in the way of that.
641	00:42:37	00:42:42	When it's time for someone to move on, you just gotta let them go.
642	00:42:42	00:42:45	Let's play the game, shall we?
643	00:42:45	00:42:47	Okay.
644	00:42:47	00:42:49	Oh!
645	00:42:49	00:42:51	Mind if I record this?
646	00:42:53	00:42:56	Scenario 12, Hodges and Grissom.
647	00:42:57	00:42:59	Okay, you walk into the AV lab.
648	00:42:59	00:43:03	You find Archie slumped over his computer with a knife in his head...
