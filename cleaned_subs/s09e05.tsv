0	00:00:01	00:00:04	I have been thinking about us a lot, though.
1	00:00:04	00:00:07	All the moments.
2	00:00:07	00:00:10	I thought we could survive anything.
3	00:00:28	00:00:31	This trip has given me a lot of clarity.
4	00:00:31	00:00:36	That last year in Vegas, I could barely breathe, let alone... think.
5	00:00:52	00:00:54	Officers!
6	00:00:54	00:00:55	I need your help.
7	00:00:55	00:00:57	We've got to preserve those tire tracks.
8	00:01:01	00:01:03	Take your stick, dig a trench.
9	00:01:03	00:01:06	Got to divert the water.
10	00:01:12	00:01:14	Catherine?
11	00:01:24	00:01:27	You covered the body with a tarp.
12	00:01:27	00:01:28	You contaminated the evidence.
13	00:01:28	00:01:30	First responder tarped it before I even arrived.
14	00:01:30	00:01:31	Thought he was helping out.
15	00:01:31	00:01:34	I should be giving you grief. You were up.
16	00:01:34	00:01:35	Dispatch said you didn't acknowledge.
17	00:01:35	00:01:38	What do you know?
18	00:01:38	00:01:40	Trucker spotted the body.
19	00:01:40	00:01:42	Called it in.
20	00:01:44	00:01:47	Face is embedded with asphalt.
21	00:01:47	00:01:49	Got here as fast as I could.
22	00:01:49	00:01:51	See if he's got any I.D.
23	00:01:55	00:01:58	Nothing.
24	00:01:58	00:02:02	Rigidity hasn't extended into the limbs.
25	00:02:02	00:02:04	And the lividity's blanching.
26	00:02:04	00:02:07	Probably been dead two to four hours.
27	00:02:08	00:02:10	Fingers and toes are gone.
28	00:02:10	00:02:14	Ligature marks around the posterior aspects of both wrists.
29	00:02:14	00:02:16	Tied up and dragged?
30	00:02:16	00:02:19	Well, then the rest of his body should look like hamburger.
31	00:02:19	00:02:20	Roll him.
32	00:02:28	00:02:31	Burnt motor oil.
33	00:02:31	00:02:33	And his shirt looks like it was scorched.
34	00:02:33	00:02:36	He could have been tied to the undercarriage of a vehicle.
35	00:02:36	00:02:40	Vehicle with a high ground clearance-- truck, SUV.
36	00:02:40	00:02:43	We got to get this body out of here.
37	00:02:43	00:02:44	Where are the easy-ups??
38	00:02:44	00:02:46	They're on their way.
39	00:02:48	00:02:57	Before I left, um, you said some things that I tried not to hear, but now, uh, I think you were right.
40	00:03:41	00:03:44	Looks like Hawk here played softball for Talmadge Media.
41	00:03:44	00:03:46	I'll have Brass run down his real name.
42	00:03:53	00:03:55	Two, three, four...
43	00:03:55	00:03:59	six, seven, eight, nine stab wounds in his shirt?
44	00:03:59	00:04:03	What's the matter, you got a migraine?
45	00:04:03	00:04:04	No.
46	00:04:04	00:04:05	Go call Brass.
47	00:04:05	00:04:08	All right.
48	00:04:11	00:04:18	Well, I still have to do the paperwork and fill out a tox request on a hit-and-run.
49	00:04:18	00:04:21	Tissue was white, so, no blood flow.
50	00:04:21	00:04:25	Means, what happened to the face happened postmortem.
51	00:04:25	00:04:28	I can see his brains through his nasal cavities.
52	00:04:28	00:04:30	That's cool.
53	00:04:30	00:04:33	Well, B.R.B.-- be right back.
54	00:04:33	00:04:36	My wife's got me into texting now.
55	00:04:54	00:04:54	All right.
56	00:04:55	00:04:56	No, that's it, Jim. Thanks.
57	00:04:57	00:05:02	Rope marks on the upper and lower torso, but no bruising.
58	00:05:02	00:05:04	Postmortem.
59	00:05:04	00:05:06	So are the stab wounds.
60	00:05:06	00:05:08	Nipples are swollen.
61	00:05:08	00:05:12	And it looks like puncture wounds around the areola.
62	00:05:13	00:05:15	If it was tattooing, there'd be ink.
63	00:05:15	00:05:17	Piercing, there'd be metal.
64	00:05:17	00:05:18	I don't know, man.
65	00:05:18	00:05:21	A kinky way to shoot up drugs?
66	00:05:22	00:05:25	I'll have Robbins work up a histo.
67	00:05:42	00:05:45	Eight and three quarter-inch tread width.
68	00:05:45	00:05:48	So, that's consistent with a small truck or SUV.
69	00:05:48	00:05:52	Boy, there must be a lot of clay in this soil.
70	00:05:52	00:05:54	Otherwise, this track would have totally washed away.
71	00:05:56	00:05:58	My shoes are ruined.
72	00:05:58	00:06:00	Why didn't you tell me to wear boots?
73	00:06:00	00:06:03	Or, better yet, hire some more CSIs.
74	00:06:03	00:06:05	Trust me, you were my last choice.
75	00:06:06	00:06:07	Thank you.
76	00:06:23	00:06:25	Ow! Ow!
77	00:06:25	00:06:28	(gasps) Catherine, man down!
78	00:06:31	00:06:33	Found a rope.
79	00:06:33	00:06:34	Got a splinter.
80	00:06:34	00:06:38	Think I pierced an artery.
81	00:06:44	00:06:46	Blood.
82	00:06:46	00:06:49	Nylon rope.
83	00:06:49	00:06:55	Must have been used to tie the body to the undercarriage.
84	00:06:55	00:06:59	When the rope melted, body dropped onto the road.
85	00:06:59	00:07:08	So, killer's driving along, loses his cargo, pulls over, and drags the body out into the desert.
86	00:07:08	00:07:09	Had to have been an accidental body dump.
87	00:07:09	00:07:13	Why go to the trouble to tie it up under the car in the first place?
88	00:07:13	00:07:18	Because if a cop stops you, they're going to look inside the car, not underneath it.
89	00:07:26	00:07:29	Let me take a walk through. Hang back a second.
90	00:07:40	00:07:41	All clear.
91	00:07:41	00:07:45	No sign of forced entry.
92	00:07:45	00:07:47	Apart from us.
93	00:07:48	00:07:49	Why don't you take this?
94	00:07:49	00:07:51	I'll check the back.
95	00:08:11	00:08:13	Well, I got an I.D.
96	00:08:13	00:08:16	Ian Wallace was a good-looking kid.
97	00:08:16	00:08:18	Smells like citrus.
98	00:08:48	00:08:51	Got a blood drop with an air bubble.
99	00:08:54	00:08:56	Got to be saliva.
100	00:08:56	00:08:59	Hey, somebody got punched.
101	00:09:03	00:09:06	Found more blood.
102	00:09:06	00:09:08	Somebody tried to clean up.
103	00:09:08	00:09:11	Ran tox on hamburger head.
104	00:09:11	00:09:14	Low levels of THC and alcohol.
105	00:09:14	00:09:19	For what's it worth, I don't think he was injecting weed or beer into his nipples.
106	00:09:19	00:09:24	Although, this one time, Hodges and I were growing botox, and he goes, and he injects it.
107	00:09:24	00:09:27	It's okay, Henry. I don't need to know any more.
108	00:09:27	00:09:30	Yeah.
109	00:09:36	00:09:40	Hello from below the equator and Puerto Ayora.
110	00:09:40	00:09:42	We've been at sea over a month now.
111	00:09:42	00:09:44	You wouldn't believe the crew.
112	00:09:44	00:09:47	Students, activists, scientists.
113	00:09:47	00:09:50	The dinner conversations alone are mind-blowing.
114	00:09:50	00:09:54	There's even this, uh, marine biologist that reminds me a little bit of you.
115	00:09:54	00:10:01	I wish that we could talk in person, but, uh, this is the best that I can do.
116	00:10:04	00:10:06	I want to apologize for being out of touch.
117	00:10:06	00:10:11	I have been thinking about us a lot, though.
118	00:10:11	00:10:13	All the moments.
119	00:10:13	00:10:16	I thought we could survive anything.
120	00:10:17	00:10:20	This trip has given me a lot of clarity.
121	00:10:20	00:10:34	That last year in Vegas, I could barely breathe, let alone... think, but, um, now, for the first time in a really long time, I'm happy.
122	00:10:34	00:10:37	Ian's sports car is in the garage.
123	00:10:37	00:10:38	Other spot's empty.
124	00:10:38	00:10:41	I did find some fresh oil stains and rope burns, though.
125	00:10:41	00:10:42	Mm-hmm.
126	00:10:42	00:10:45	So, I'm thinking the killer probably pulled his truck into the garage.
127	00:10:45	00:10:48	Would have given him plenty of time to tie up the body.
128	00:10:48	00:10:49	Back door's unlocked.
129	00:10:50	00:10:51	Anybody could have gotten in here.
130	00:10:51	00:10:53	Victim definitely lived with a chick.
131	00:10:53	00:10:57	Napkin holders, heart-shaped pillows.
132	00:10:57	00:10:59	Women's' magazines.
133	00:11:00	00:11:01	Yeah. Where is she?
134	00:11:01	00:11:03	I don't see a purse around here.
135	00:11:03	00:11:07	Maybe she roped him to the bottom of her truck and split.
136	00:11:09	00:11:10	I got a name.
137	00:11:10	00:11:12	Justine Stefani.
138	00:11:12	00:11:14	Okay.
139	00:11:14	00:11:17	I'll have Brass put out a broadcast.
140	00:11:46	00:11:51	Puncture wounds didn't penetrate any of the significant blood vessels.
141	00:11:51	00:11:58	And there's no evidence of injection or scar tissue, so that rules out drug abuse.
142	00:11:58	00:12:02	Punctures were made by 18-gauge needles which pierced the areola.
143	00:12:02	00:12:06	They were arranged in a symmetrical pattern around the nipples.
144	00:12:06	00:12:07	Have you ever seen this?
145	00:12:08	00:12:09	Never.
146	00:12:09	00:12:10	Or this.
147	00:12:10	00:12:14	What appear to be minor burn marks on the upper and lower surfaces of the tongue.
148	00:12:15	00:12:17	There are no other burn marks in the oral cavity.
149	00:12:17	00:12:19	Histo confirmed the burns were electrical.
150	00:12:19	00:12:20	They grilled his tongue?
151	00:12:21	00:12:22	That's sick.
152	00:12:22	00:12:24	Torture. That would be my opinion at this time.
153	00:12:24	00:12:25	COD?
154	00:12:25	00:12:27	Manual asphyxia.
155	00:12:27	00:12:28	Bruising around the trachea.
156	00:12:28	00:12:29	Broken hyoid bone.
157	00:12:30	00:12:31	Killer strangled him with his bare hands.
158	00:12:33	00:12:43	So, Ian Wallace was restrained, his nipples were stimulated, he had minor burns on his tongue, and he was asphyxiated.
159	00:12:43	00:12:44	S and M?
160	00:12:44	00:12:46	Gone very, very wrong.
161	00:12:46	00:12:50	These stab wounds are brutal, random and postmortem.
162	00:12:50	00:12:52	Which is inconsistent with S and M.
163	00:12:52	00:12:56	Well, it's hard to take pleasure in someone's pain once they're dead.
164	00:12:56	00:12:58	Which is the gone wrong part.
165	00:13:05	00:13:07	You're a doctor-- is that normal?
166	00:13:07	00:13:09	Grissom being socially awkward?
167	00:13:09	00:13:10	Yeah, that's normal.
168	00:13:10	00:13:12	He won't talk to me.
169	00:13:12	00:13:15	And he doesn't appear to be sleeping much.
170	00:13:49	00:13:51	Grissom.
171	00:13:53	00:13:56	What are you doing here?
172	00:13:56	00:13:58	I should have called. I'm sorry.
173	00:13:58	00:14:00	(thunder rumbling) I... I didn't know I was coming.
174	00:14:02	00:14:04	What do you want?
175	00:14:13	00:14:16	Thank you.
176	00:14:18	00:14:21	When was the last time you had a good night's sleep?
177	00:14:21	00:14:24	Bad dreams.
178	00:14:26	00:14:28	How can I help?
179	00:14:28	00:14:36	I, uh... have a body with S and M type wounds, but there are inconsistencies.
180	00:14:36	00:14:40	So I was hoping to get your first impressions.
181	00:14:40	00:14:44	My first impression... is that you've changed.
182	00:14:44	00:14:47	Come on.
183	00:14:47	00:14:49	How have you been?
184	00:14:49	00:14:53	I got my Masters in psychology last year.
185	00:14:53	00:14:55	I'm a licensed therapist.
186	00:14:55	00:14:58	I now have patients, not clients.
187	00:14:58	00:15:02	Let me guess-- you specialize in sex therapy?
188	00:15:02	00:15:05	These wounds around his nipples are from needle play.
189	00:15:05	00:15:07	The arrangement is called stacking.
190	00:15:09	00:15:11	May I touch you?
191	00:15:13	00:15:19	Needles are inserted transversely and sagittally, which raises the nipple upward.
192	00:15:19	00:15:22	This causes the nipple to swell and become highly sensitive.
193	00:15:22	00:15:24	Which creates a pain button.
194	00:15:24	00:15:29	Any touch or pressure overwhelms the senses and releases a flood of endorphins.
195	00:15:31	00:15:34	So, uh...
196	00:15:34	00:15:38	our victim is a submissive who enjoyed pain.
197	00:15:38	00:15:42	He also had electrical burns on his tongue.
198	00:15:43	00:15:47	Now I'm familiar with the use of gags in S and M.
199	00:15:47	00:15:48	And some are metal.
200	00:15:48	00:15:51	Did you ever use electricity?
201	00:15:51	00:15:54	I never used electricity above the waist.
202	00:15:54	00:15:58	It only takes six milliamps to stop the heart.
203	00:15:58	00:16:00	It's too dangerous.
204	00:16:00	00:16:01	This is tongue bondage.
205	00:16:01	00:16:05	It's used in medical exam fantasies as part of humiliation.
206	00:16:05	00:16:10	You ask the patient to stick out their tongue, grab the tongue with chopsticks, rubber band them to create a dental gag.
207	00:16:10	00:16:16	In a typical situation, one would use wood chopsticks, which would leave some bruising and if you're lucky, splinters.
208	00:16:16	00:16:21	In this case, metal chopsticks may have been used and electricity applied.
209	00:16:22	00:16:24	These are masochistic injuries.
210	00:16:25	00:16:27	So we're looking for a dominant?
211	00:16:27	00:16:29	Mm-hmm.
212	00:16:29	00:16:31	He lived with a woman.
213	00:16:31	00:16:33	Was she into the lifestyle? We don't know.
214	00:16:33	00:16:34	She's missing.
215	00:16:34	00:16:38	I'd like to see photos of their bedroom.
216	00:16:38	00:16:41	Sometimes it's obvious.
217	00:16:41	00:16:44	Sometimes it's not.
218	00:16:44	00:16:46	All right, copy that.
219	00:16:46	00:16:50	I'll efax you the over-alls if we find anything.
220	00:16:50	00:16:52	Okay.
221	00:16:52	00:16:56	Grissom wants us to look for any S and M paraphernalia.
222	00:16:56	00:17:02	I once had an old lady in her 70's-- burglary victim.
223	00:17:02	00:17:03	Had to process her vibrators.
224	00:17:05	00:17:07	Some of them were burned out.
225	00:17:07	00:17:09	Why would you process her... tuning forks?
226	00:17:09	00:17:12	I'm thorough.
227	00:17:23	00:17:26	I got a booty smudge on the TV.
228	00:17:31	00:17:34	Justine super-sized herself.
229	00:17:34	00:17:36	Double-D implants.
230	00:17:36	00:17:37	Welcome to Vegas.
231	00:17:45	00:17:47	Positive for semen.
232	00:18:02	00:18:07	What does it say about me that I always find the smut?
233	00:18:07	00:18:09	That you're lucky.
234	00:18:12	00:18:15	Guess they were into S and M.
235	00:18:23	00:18:24	You ever been tied up?
236	00:18:24	00:18:26	What do you think?
237	00:18:26	00:18:28	I think you're more into hair pulling.
238	00:18:28	00:18:29	Hey...
239	00:18:29	00:18:30	knock it off.
240	00:18:32	00:18:34	Get me some pictures of that stuff, will ya?
241	00:18:38	00:18:40	Got a bloody shirt in a laundry basket.
242	00:18:44	00:18:50	Bloodstains match the puncture marks on Ian's pecs.
243	00:18:50	00:18:55	Which means he must have changed his shirt after the nipple action, but before he was killed.
244	00:18:55	00:18:59	Girlfriend could've redressed him, tossed the shirt in the basket out of habit.
245	00:18:59	00:19:01	Yeah, and then what?
246	00:19:01	00:19:05	Little Justine ties 200 pounds of dead weight up under her SUV?
247	00:19:06	00:19:07	Well, I could do it.
248	00:19:07	00:19:08	It's just physics and leverage.
249	00:19:08	00:19:11	Takes brains not brawn. I don't think you could.
250	00:19:11	00:19:13	I think you could do it.
251	00:19:13	00:19:15	The killing part, too.
252	00:19:21	00:19:23	The trunk contains male slave gear.
253	00:19:25	00:19:29	Needle and electro play requires special equipment.
254	00:19:29	00:19:32	I don't see any dedicated S and M room.
255	00:19:32	00:19:34	So he didn't play at home.
256	00:19:34	00:19:37	Do you think he went to a professional?
257	00:19:41	00:19:43	Lower Linx is part of the amateur scene.
258	00:19:43	00:19:46	It has a well-equipped back room.
259	00:19:46	00:19:47	You have to know the right people.
260	00:19:47	00:19:49	Rents by the hour.
261	00:20:13	00:20:19	You know, it's a proven sociological fact that the public won't commingle with the cops.
262	00:20:19	00:20:22	I try not to take it personally.
263	00:20:22	00:20:24	Yeah, me either.
264	00:20:39	00:20:41	I'd like to talk to the owner.
265	00:20:41	00:20:43	Michelle Tournay.
266	00:20:43	00:20:45	All my licenses are current.
267	00:20:45	00:20:46	What do you want?
268	00:20:47	00:20:50	You recognize these people?
269	00:20:50	00:20:53	Do you have any security cameras?
270	00:20:53	00:20:56	Being Big Brother's your job.
271	00:20:56	00:20:58	Well, Big Brother would like to see the back room.
272	00:20:58	00:21:01	You know what I mean-- the real back room.
273	00:21:01	00:21:02	I'm done cooperating.
274	00:21:02	00:21:04	Get a warrant.
275	00:21:04	00:21:05	Okay.
276	00:21:05	00:21:08	That could take a couple of hours. We'll wait.
277	00:21:11	00:21:13	Got a menu?
278	00:21:20	00:21:21	Who else has a key to this room?
279	00:21:21	00:21:23	Only me.
280	00:21:23	00:21:24	Okay.
281	00:21:50	00:21:51	Looks like an oscilloscope.
282	00:21:51	00:21:55	This is the juice right here.
283	00:22:01	00:22:03	Hey, Jim, check it out.
284	00:22:03	00:22:05	Chopsticks.
285	00:22:10	00:22:12	What's the word?
286	00:22:12	00:22:14	Sex.
287	00:22:14	00:22:20	That love juice from near the TV was a mixture of seminal fluid and vaginal secretions.
288	00:22:20	00:22:21	Ian and his girlfriend?
289	00:22:21	00:22:25	Well, yes on him, but assuming that that was her toothbrush you gave me, definitely no on her.
290	00:22:25	00:22:27	That's motive.
291	00:22:27	00:22:31	Dom-girlfriend finds her man doing the nasty with some hood rat in their bedroom and kills him.
292	00:22:31	00:22:34	Yeah... I found more.
293	00:22:34	00:22:39	It's on the shirt that you gave me from Ian Wallace's laundry basket.
294	00:22:41	00:22:43	High-velocity blood stains?
295	00:22:43	00:22:45	Our victim wasn't shot.
296	00:22:45	00:22:49	No, but sometimes expiratory blood can actually mimic high-velocity gunshot spatter.
297	00:22:53	00:22:55	It's on the back of the shoulder.
298	00:22:55	00:22:57	It's probably not his.
299	00:22:57	00:23:00	Maybe he's got the killer on his back.
300	00:23:00	00:23:10	Before I left, uh, you said some things that I tried not to hear, but now, uh, I think you were right.
301	00:23:10	00:23:15	If a relationship can't move forward, it withers.
302	00:23:17	00:23:20	There's a schism between the lovers.
303	00:23:20	00:23:26	Ian and Justine have different priorities, different roles.
304	00:23:27	00:23:31	She's the keeper of the hearth-- sentimental, traditional.
305	00:23:31	00:23:33	Mass card and rosary in her nightstand.
306	00:23:33	00:23:36	A good girl, afraid of the dark.
307	00:23:36	00:23:38	What about him?
308	00:23:39	00:23:42	Ian liked to compartmentalize.
309	00:23:42	00:23:43	It made him feel safe.
310	00:23:43	00:23:45	Everything had its place.
311	00:23:45	00:23:47	Work, her, sports.
312	00:23:47	00:23:51	He kept his dark side locked in a trunk, hidden away from her.
313	00:23:53	00:23:56	Does Sara know you're here?
314	00:23:56	00:23:59	No.
315	00:23:59	00:24:01	Am I your secret?
316	00:24:01	00:24:06	No, and you're not my therapist.
317	00:24:12	00:24:18	They found some evidence that Ian may have had sex with another woman in their house.
318	00:24:18	00:24:23	That's his subconscious desire to be caught and punished, which is why he chose Justine as a partner.
319	00:24:23	00:24:27	He's got a mommy to hide things from.
320	00:24:27	00:24:29	The Virgin Mother.
321	00:24:29	00:24:34	Justine is an enabler, not a dominant.
322	00:24:34	00:24:37	Even if she discovered his infidelities, she couldn't harm him.
323	00:24:37	00:24:40	She's not your killer.
324	00:24:44	00:24:47	The Boulder City cop was able to run the burnt license plate.
325	00:24:47	00:24:51	The registered owner is Justine Stefani.
326	00:24:51	00:24:55	I'm guessing we're about 20 miles southeast of the original crime scene.
327	00:24:59	00:25:01	Those are breast implants.
328	00:25:01	00:25:05	Unlike most plastic, silicone is extremely heat resistant.
329	00:25:05	00:25:06	Justine Stefani had fake boobs.
330	00:25:06	00:25:08	I saw a photo of her.
331	00:25:08	00:25:12	Doc Robbins will be able to match the serial numbers of those implants and confirm her identity.
332	00:25:12	00:25:16	Which means our suspect is now a victim.
333	00:25:22	00:25:28	Serial numbers from the breast implants confirm the victim is Justine Stefani.
334	00:25:28	00:25:30	Dave, do you want to flip her over?
335	00:25:33	00:25:38	Third-degree burns over 75% of her body.
336	00:25:38	00:25:40	Doc, take a look.
337	00:25:40	00:25:42	The victim's arms were bound.
338	00:25:42	00:25:45	Ligature marks are ante-mortem.
339	00:25:45	00:25:51	Found a set of shoe impressions heading away from the highway.
340	00:25:52	00:25:55	Tire impressions followed them.
341	00:26:00	00:26:04	Found Justine's boots under the vehicle.
342	00:26:10	00:26:13	C.O.D. was multiple traumatic injuries-- homicide.
343	00:26:13	00:26:19	Compound fractures to both femurs indicate impact back to front.
344	00:26:19	00:26:26	Fractures are inconsistent with passenger injuries, but consistent with a pedestrian being hit by a vehicle.
345	00:26:29	00:26:33	Found a clump of Justine's hair on the skid plate.
346	00:26:33	00:26:37	She was ultimately killed by her own SUV.
347	00:26:38	00:26:47	Axle was cracked, making the vehicle undriveable, which is probably why the killer torched it.
348	00:26:47	00:26:52	A second set of impressions were consistent with a size nine athletic shoe.
349	00:26:52	00:26:56	The footwear trail ended at a separate set of tire impressions just off the road.
350	00:26:57	00:27:02	The killer may have flagged down a passing motorist or had an accomplice.
351	00:27:03	00:27:05	So we have two new suspects.
352	00:27:05	00:27:11	One of whom wears a size nine shoe, which is the equivalent of a woman's size 11.
353	00:27:11	00:27:15	The other suspect drives a vehicle with two different brands of tires.
354	00:27:15	00:27:19	Front were Pirelli P-235 70R 15s.
355	00:27:19	00:27:21	Rear were same size Michelin.
356	00:27:21	00:27:23	Can't narrow it down.
357	00:27:23	00:27:32	We know that Ian was killed at the house and transported in Justine's car, so Justine had to have been kidnapped from the house.
358	00:27:32	00:27:36	So whatever started at the Lower Linx ended at their house.
359	00:27:36	00:27:39	She must have walked in on it.
360	00:27:39	00:27:40	Why not just kill her there?
361	00:27:42	00:27:46	I mean, if you take a live female victim, there's a reason.
362	00:27:46	00:27:49	You want to take your time with her.
363	00:27:49	00:27:54	I did collect these metal chopsticks from the Lower Linx.
364	00:27:54	00:27:56	They're used in tongue bondage.
365	00:27:56	00:28:06	Now, the center saliva DNA is a match to Ian Wallace, but on the ends, the epithelial DNA, unknown female.
366	00:28:06	00:28:10	It did, however, match the DNA profile from the vaginal secretions at the house.
367	00:28:10	00:28:12	So Ian was sleeping with his dom.
368	00:28:13	00:28:17	You know, I got a real dominatrix vibe from Miss Tournay.
369	00:28:18	00:28:21	Her and Lady Heather could be sisters.
370	00:28:21	00:28:23	Who's Lady Heather?
371	00:28:23	00:28:26	Oh, that's a whole other Oprah.
372	00:28:26	00:28:31	Changing the channel, do we have enough to get a warrant for Ms. Tournay's DNA?
373	00:28:31	00:28:34	Yeah, I think so. I'll talk to the DA.
374	00:28:34	00:28:36	Oh, we also might have a lead on the other suspect.
375	00:28:37	00:28:38	I ran Justine's phone records.
376	00:28:38	00:28:44	12 P.M.
377	00:28:44	00:28:47	I have tremendous respect for law enforcement.
378	00:28:47	00:28:50	Risking your lives every day for so little reward.
379	00:28:50	00:28:53	How'd you get Justine Stefani's phone number?
380	00:28:53	00:28:57	Got it off a warm call list.
381	00:28:57	00:28:59	She was a Web site surfer, Jim.
382	00:29:00	00:29:01	Left her contact info.
383	00:29:01	00:29:02	What'd you two talk about?
384	00:29:02	00:29:06	Life insurance, term for her and her soon-to-be fiancÃ©.
385	00:29:06	00:29:07	She was a planner.
386	00:29:07	00:29:08	Did you talk to the boyfriend?
387	00:29:08	00:29:10	Only her, Jim.
388	00:29:10	00:29:12	You ever been to their house?
389	00:29:12	00:29:14	No, it was one phone call.
390	00:29:14	00:29:16	Chatted her up and talked some turkey.
391	00:29:16	00:29:18	Oh, did you close her on the insurance?
392	00:29:18	00:29:21	I had her going, then out of the blue, she hangs up.
393	00:29:21	00:29:22	Oh.
394	00:29:22	00:29:24	Yeah, I lost that fish.
395	00:29:24	00:29:27	Sorry I can't be of more help, Jim. I...
396	00:29:27	00:29:30	But meeting me could be the best thing that ever happened to you.
397	00:29:30	00:29:32	Oh, yeah?
398	00:29:32	00:29:34	You see, most cops are under-insured.
399	00:29:34	00:29:36	And it's your family that'll suffer.
400	00:29:36	00:29:42	I can hook you up with catastrophic life, an umbrella policy and car insurance in less than ten minutes and it'll save you money.
401	00:29:42	00:29:43	Thanks. I'm all set. Thanks.
402	00:29:43	00:29:47	In the heterosexual world, men want to be dominated by women.
403	00:29:47	00:29:48	and women by men.
404	00:29:48	00:29:50	So Wallace would have had a female dominant.
405	00:29:50	00:29:53	Well, we've confirmed that through physical evidence.
406	00:29:53	00:29:54	She also slept with him.
407	00:29:54	00:29:57	Which is why one should always go to a professional.
408	00:29:57	00:29:59	They know the boundaries.
409	00:29:59	00:30:01	I feel the same way about crime scene investigators.
410	00:30:01	00:30:03	And no one has more rigid boundaries than you.
411	00:30:03	00:30:08	We know there was at least one killer, but there may have been two.
412	00:30:09	00:30:11	But we don't know if it was a man or a woman.
413	00:30:11	00:30:15	If your dominant is the killer, she would most likely choose a slave to assist her.
414	00:30:15	00:30:17	Someone she could trust and control.
415	00:30:17	00:30:19	Which would be a man. Mm.
416	00:30:19	00:30:22	Amateurs often play scenes in groups.
417	00:30:22	00:30:26	And the dom would select slaves who share similar fantasies and fetishes.
418	00:30:26	00:30:30	Why did you lie to us about knowing Ian Wallace?
419	00:30:30	00:30:34	We have physical evidence linking him to your S and M room, so we know you know him.
420	00:30:34	00:30:39	You had no right to ask the question, therefore I had no obligation to answer it.
421	00:30:39	00:30:48	I have a warrant to collect buccal swabs, take all your shoes, and search your SUV.
422	00:30:48	00:30:51	What do you need the stuff for?
423	00:30:51	00:30:53	Doesn't matter. I have a warrant.
424	00:30:53	00:30:54	I can take it.
425	00:30:55	00:30:58	So why don't you tell me what's going on?
426	00:30:59	00:31:03	Yes, I facilitate people's BDS&amp;amp;M scenes.
427	00:31:03	00:31:05	It's a way to make money.
428	00:31:05	00:31:07	It's not something I practice.
429	00:31:07	00:31:08	I'm an entrepreneur.
430	00:31:08	00:31:11	I majored in theater.
431	00:31:11	00:31:12	Don't you get it?
432	00:31:12	00:31:17	I get that you're looking at two counts of capital murder.
433	00:31:17	00:31:19	I hope you're a good actress.
434	00:31:23	00:31:24	Look, Ian came in a lot.
435	00:31:24	00:31:28	Got to know each other, I ended up sleeping with him.
436	00:31:28	00:31:30	At his house. We know that, too.
437	00:31:30	00:31:33	No. I have rules.
438	00:31:33	00:31:38	I'm not uptight about sex, but I like my privacy.
439	00:31:38	00:31:41	Never been to his house, he'd never been to mine.
440	00:31:41	00:31:43	Open wide.
441	00:31:43	00:31:48	I'm not letting you take my DNA and put it in some system where it's gonna stay the rest of my life.
442	00:31:48	00:31:50	If you're innocent, what does it matter?
443	00:31:50	00:31:52	That just proves you're a fascist and this is a police state.
444	00:31:52	00:31:54	Help me out here, will you, Mitch?
445	00:31:54	00:31:59	Ma'am, if you don't let the CSI do his job, I'm gonna have to arrest you for obstruction.
446	00:32:18	00:32:20	Turned you on, didn't it?
447	00:32:20	00:32:23	Bet you're standing at attention.
448	00:32:23	00:32:27	Hypocrite. You're no different than the freaks that rent my back room.
449	00:32:30	00:32:34	So I got a match from that high-velocity bloodstain on the Ian Wallace shirt.
450	00:32:34	00:32:39	Your suspect has seven out of 13 alleles in common with a convicted felon named George Devlin.
451	00:32:39	00:32:42	Look, he's still serving time.
452	00:32:42	00:32:45	Justine got a call from a Martin Devlin the night she died.
453	00:32:45	00:32:49	Mr. Devlin, are you sure you don't want to call Legal Aid and ask for a senior attorney?
454	00:32:49	00:32:52	I trust her completely.
455	00:32:52	00:32:53	Okay.
456	00:32:53	00:32:55	Let's start with the DNA sample.
457	00:32:55	00:32:56	We refuse.
458	00:32:56	00:32:57	Too invasive.
459	00:32:57	00:32:58	We have a warrant.
460	00:32:58	00:33:01	Then I'll file a motion to quash it.
461	00:33:01	00:33:05	We have Mr. Devlin's blood on the victim's shirt and we have a mother lode of probable cause.
462	00:33:05	00:33:11	I'll argue that under the Daubert Standards, your DNA analysis is unreliable and invalid.
463	00:33:11	00:33:12	Hmm.
464	00:33:16	00:33:17	Please remove your shirt.
465	00:33:17	00:33:18	I said no.
466	00:33:18	00:33:19	Transitory evidence. We don't need a warrant.
467	00:33:20	00:33:21	Come on. Let's go.
468	00:33:33	00:33:35	No, no...
469	00:33:37	00:33:38	Needle play.
470	00:33:38	00:33:41	You're into S and M?
471	00:33:42	00:33:45	Stick out your tongue and say, Ah.
472	00:33:46	00:33:48	Ah.
473	00:33:48	00:33:50	Boy, I hope you have a lot of insurance, Marty.
474	00:33:50	00:33:52	What are you accusing my client of?
475	00:33:52	00:33:53	We already have his dom in custody.
476	00:33:53	00:33:57	Sooner or later, she's going to roll on him, and then we have him on the hook for kidnapping and murder.
477	00:33:57	00:33:59	Oh, you like hooks, don't you, Marty?
478	00:33:59	00:34:00	I didn't kidnap anybody.
479	00:34:00	00:34:02	Is that a confession?
480	00:34:02	00:34:03	I'm advising you to remain silent.
481	00:34:03	00:34:04	So what happened?
482	00:34:04	00:34:08	You and Ms. Tournay followed Ian Wallace home from the Lower Linx and then you had a fight?
483	00:34:14	00:34:15	One of you killed him.
484	00:34:15	00:34:19	Called his girlfriend-- told her she better come home.
485	00:34:19	00:34:21	Probably planned on framing her.
486	00:34:21	00:34:23	And then you lassoed him under Justine's car.
487	00:34:23	00:34:26	What kind of car do you drive, Marty?
488	00:34:26	00:34:31	Michelle was driving a Durango, and you were following behind like a nice little slave.
489	00:34:31	00:34:33	But then things get weird.
490	00:34:33	00:34:35	The body fell out on the road.
491	00:34:35	00:34:39	Justine made a break for it, and I bet you were the one who decided to set her on fire. Stop... stop!
492	00:34:39	00:34:41	There are no safe words here, Marty.
493	00:34:41	00:34:42	This is a police station.
494	00:34:42	00:34:45	You like pain?
495	00:34:45	00:34:47	'Cause you're going to be in for a treat.
496	00:34:47	00:34:49	We're invoking. We're done.
497	00:34:51	00:34:55	I noticed in the autopsy report that Mr. Wallace was stabbed after he was dead.
498	00:34:55	00:34:57	Right.
499	00:34:57	00:35:00	Which would make your dom a sexual sadist.
500	00:35:00	00:35:01	That's highly unusual.
501	00:35:01	00:35:03	Why?
502	00:35:03	00:35:06	There must be sexual sadists that seek out that world.
503	00:35:06	00:35:10	See, sexual sadists are typically charming loners.
504	00:35:10	00:35:15	They would be repulsed by a consensual, safe and communicative lifestyle.
505	00:35:15	00:35:17	When a submissive says stop, you have to stop.
506	00:35:17	00:35:20	That doesn't work for a sexual sadist.
507	00:35:20	00:35:21	They get off on the terror of their subjects.
508	00:35:22	00:35:25	So you think that S and M play was not involved in the murders?
509	00:35:25	00:35:26	They were separate events?
510	00:35:26	00:35:28	That would be my expert opinion.
511	00:35:30	00:35:33	May I make a personal observation?
512	00:35:33	00:35:37	As a friend, not as a therapist?
513	00:35:37	00:35:40	Everything I've told you, you could have read in a book.
514	00:35:40	00:35:46	I think the case is a mere pretext and you're here for a more personal reason.
515	00:35:46	00:35:55	Before I left, you said some things that I tried not to hear, but now, uh, I think you were right.
516	00:35:55	00:36:01	If a relationship can't move forward, it withers.
517	00:36:03	00:36:07	I've been waiting for you to decide.
518	00:36:07	00:36:13	But sometimes not making a decision is making a decision.
519	00:36:15	00:36:17	Where's Sara?
520	00:36:23	00:36:25	What stopped you?
521	00:36:25	00:36:27	I don't know.
522	00:36:27	00:36:29	A lot of things.
523	00:36:29	00:36:31	Devotion to your work?
524	00:36:31	00:36:34	Loyalty to the team? Fear of the unknown?
525	00:36:34	00:36:38	Do you regret your decision not to go with her?
526	00:36:40	00:36:42	It was beyond my control.
527	00:36:42	00:36:44	Really?
528	00:36:47	00:36:50	Most relationships are over before they end.
529	00:36:51	00:36:53	But it's still a death.
530	00:36:53	00:36:58	You mourn the loss, have conflicting emotions-- but oftentimes there's a sense of relief.
531	00:36:59	00:37:01	We've all experienced it, but no one wants to admit it.
532	00:37:03	00:37:06	I didn't say the relationship was over.
533	00:37:06	00:37:08	You didn't have to.
534	00:37:08	00:37:11	Not making a decision was your decision.
535	00:37:15	00:37:17	Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, uh...
536	00:37:17	00:37:21	you don't have to worry about me anymore.
537	00:37:21	00:37:24	I'm good.
538	00:37:24	00:37:26	I'm really good.
539	00:37:26	00:37:28	And honestly...
540	00:37:28	00:37:31	I think it's better this way.
541	00:37:31	00:37:35	I think you're here because it's not home.
542	00:37:35	00:37:37	It's not work.
543	00:37:37	00:37:40	And this is the only place that doesn't remind you of Sara.
544	00:37:45	00:37:47	I have a guest bedroom upstairs.
545	00:37:47	00:37:52	You can stay as long as you want.
546	00:37:56	00:38:00	I pulled Martin Devlin's info from his SIM card.
547	00:38:00	00:38:05	Guy's a big talker, but no calls to or from Michelle Tournay.
548	00:38:05	00:38:08	Did they text?
549	00:38:08	00:38:11	Well, these are all the texts.
550	00:38:11	00:38:15	Again, nothing to or from Michelle Tournay.
551	00:38:16	00:38:18	12.
552	00:38:18	00:38:22	29.
553	00:38:22	00:38:25	He sent that text one minute later.
554	00:38:28	00:38:30	Are we ready to see this photo?
555	00:38:39	00:38:41	Holy crap.
556	00:38:41	00:38:44	That's our suspect's attorney.
557	00:38:44	00:38:47	I didn't see that coming.
558	00:38:47	00:38:49	Crisscross the phone number.
559	00:38:49	00:38:51	Yeah.
560	00:38:53	00:38:55	Who the hell is Marshall Jeffries?
561	00:38:55	00:38:57	It's one digit off from Justine's number.
562	00:38:57	00:39:04	He must have panicked-- typed in the wrong number and sent the money shot to a stranger.
563	00:39:04	00:39:06	We have a new suspect.
564	00:39:07	00:39:10	How do you know Martin Devlin?
565	00:39:10	00:39:11	We just met.
566	00:39:11	00:39:12	Come on.
567	00:39:12	00:39:15	I called Legal Aid.
568	00:39:15	00:39:17	There's no record of him in the database.
569	00:39:17	00:39:20	I'm sure it's a clerical error.
570	00:39:20	00:39:27	Counselor, isn't it a conflict of interest to represent Mr. Devlin while you're having an intimate relationship with one of his victims?
571	00:39:27	00:39:32	Lawyer by day, dominatrix by night.
572	00:39:32	00:39:34	Similar skill set.
573	00:39:42	00:39:44	I was at Ian's house the night of the murder...
574	00:39:45	00:39:47	but I left just after that picture was taken.
575	00:39:47	00:39:48	Why'd you kill him?
576	00:39:48	00:39:49	I didn't.
577	00:39:49	00:39:50	So Martin did?
578	00:39:50	00:39:54	He swore to me he was innocent.
579	00:39:54	00:39:56	But I don't know.
580	00:39:58	00:40:02	The three of us did a scene together at the Lower Linx.
581	00:40:02	00:40:04	I lost control.
582	00:40:07	00:40:11	I got really turned on...
583	00:40:15	00:40:17	kissed him.
584	00:40:17	00:40:20	Martin got jealous, stepped out of his role.
585	00:40:20	00:40:24	So you're in love with Ian, Martin's in love with you, they're both your slaves.
586	00:40:24	00:40:25	Sounds like a kinky soap opera.
587	00:40:28	00:40:31	Yes.
588	00:40:31	00:40:33	I broke every rule.
589	00:40:33	00:40:34	Ian went home.
590	00:40:34	00:40:37	I wanted to tell him how I felt, so I followed him.
591	00:40:37	00:40:39	I love you.
592	00:40:39	00:40:42	I can tell you feel the same.
593	00:40:42	00:40:47	You think I'm going to introduce you to my parents and let you raise my kids?
594	00:40:47	00:40:48	My girlfriend's going to be home soon.
595	00:40:48	00:40:50	You got to go.
596	00:40:50	00:40:53	Get a grip. It was just sex.
597	00:40:53	00:40:55	Martin came in the back door.
598	00:40:55	00:40:56	He went after Ian.
599	00:40:56	00:40:59	This time, I didn't try to stop it.
600	00:40:59	00:41:00	Then Ian threw us both out.
601	00:41:00	00:41:01	I watched Martin drive away.
602	00:41:02	00:41:06	He could have gone back, but there is no way he would have killed the girlfriend.
603	00:41:07	00:41:09	Not like that.
604	00:41:09	00:41:12	We have evidence linking the lawyer to Ian.
605	00:41:12	00:41:16	Her DNA was at the Lower Linx as well as at the house.
606	00:41:16	00:41:19	Which means Michelle Tournay is no longer a suspect.
607	00:41:19	00:41:21	But there's an issue.
608	00:41:21	00:41:23	Lawyer wears a size six shoe.
609	00:41:23	00:41:26	Shoe impressions found in the desert are too big to be hers.
610	00:41:26	00:41:28	Plus, she drives a Mini Cooper.
611	00:41:28	00:41:30	So there's no match to the tire impressions.
612	00:41:30	00:41:33	Which means we can't place her at Justine's crime scene.
613	00:41:33	00:41:36	Or link her to Ian's body dump.
614	00:41:36	00:41:38	How about Martin Devlin?
615	00:41:38	00:41:41	The feet are too big, car isn't a match.
616	00:41:41	00:41:43	I even checked both their credit records.
617	00:41:43	00:41:45	Neither one rented a car.
618	00:41:45	00:41:48	So we're missing the third side of the evidence trinity.
619	00:41:48	00:41:52	We can link the scenes and the victims, but we can't link the suspects to the crime scenes.
620	00:41:52	00:41:55	The back door was unlocked.
621	00:41:55	00:41:56	Anybody could have walked right in there.
622	00:41:56	00:41:58	So are we saying it was random.
623	00:41:58	00:42:00	or they were targeted?
624	00:42:00	00:42:03	The S and M factor gave us all tunnel vision.
625	00:42:03	00:42:04	I disagree.
626	00:42:04	00:42:06	We followed the evidence.
627	00:42:06	00:42:16	Which tells us that the same night Ian's play date went wrong, a couple of psychopaths just happened to torture, kidnap and kill our vics?
628	00:42:31	00:42:34	According to Locard's theory, we're still missing something.
629	00:42:42	00:42:45	There's still got to be evidence out there.
630	00:42:56	00:42:58	Heather...
631	00:43:01	00:43:03	would you stay?
