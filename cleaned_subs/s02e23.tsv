0	00:01:17	00:01:19	Grissom.
1	00:01:21	00:01:24	I'll be right there.
2	00:01:24	00:01:28	Please tell the doctor that I have to reschedule my appointment. Thanks.
3	00:01:28	00:01:30	She should be right with... you.
4	00:01:50	00:01:52	Any I.D. yet?
5	00:01:52	00:01:55	Nothing but a blanket.
6	00:01:59	00:02:00	She live here?
7	00:02:00	00:02:01	We don't know.
8	00:02:01	00:02:03	Patrol called it in.
9	00:02:03	00:02:08	Well, whoever she is she's not talking.
10	00:02:23	00:02:26	I think she just ratted herself out.
11	00:04:01	00:04:03	Drug use?
12	00:04:03	00:04:04	No visible track marks.
13	00:04:04	00:04:08	Tox screen came up empty except for botulin.
14	00:04:08	00:04:09	Food poisoning?
15	00:04:09	00:04:12	I'll know more when I cut open her stomach.
16	00:04:12	00:04:14	Heard about the rat.
17	00:04:14	00:04:16	Hope he didn't have any children.
18	00:04:16	00:04:21	Take a look at these tiny puncture wounds in her forehead.
19	00:04:21	00:04:24	Indicates repeated injections.
20	00:04:24	00:04:25	You sure she's homeless?
21	00:04:25	00:04:27	Sometimes I'm not sure of anything.
22	00:04:27	00:04:29	beautification.
23	00:04:29	00:04:31	She was injected with pig botulism.
24	00:04:31	00:04:35	Botox... the ultimate wrinkle cream.
25	00:04:35	00:04:37	How did it get into her bloodstream?
26	00:04:37	00:04:39	Bad doctor.
27	00:04:39	00:04:40	Missed the muscle.
28	00:04:40	00:04:43	Shot directly into her supratrochlear vein.
29	00:04:43	00:04:47	Amazing the advances we make in science and the primitive uses we find for them.
30	00:04:47	00:04:50	People are still animals.
31	00:04:50	00:04:52	Signs of possible torture.
32	00:04:52	00:04:53	A lot of scaring.
33	00:04:53	00:04:54	Some old, some new.
34	00:04:54	00:04:56	What about the crater in her check?
35	00:04:56	00:05:02	The dove-tail abrasion of the margins was caused by the scraping of the handle of some weapon.
36	00:05:02	00:05:05	Tells me the blade was completely inserted-- more than once.
37	00:05:08	00:05:10	There's no ligature marks anywhere.
38	00:05:10	00:05:14	I'd think she would need to be restrained for something like that, wouldn't you?
39	00:05:14	00:05:17	Give me a few hours; I'll know more.
40	00:05:20	00:05:22	Show and tell.
41	00:05:22	00:05:23	Who?
42	00:05:23	00:05:24	Showing but not telling.
43	00:05:24	00:05:26	I found a day planner in the shopping cart.
44	00:05:26	00:05:27	Mm-hmm.
45	00:05:27	00:05:29	It's written in code.
46	00:05:29	00:05:32	T to the third power.
47	00:05:32	00:05:37	C 1023, minus ten OK equals zero.
48	00:05:37	00:05:39	Looks like ginkwork.
49	00:05:39	00:05:45	It's the kind of thing speed freaks do when they've been up for ten days straight and they've already taken apart the radio.
50	00:05:45	00:05:47	Yeah. I write everything down in shorthand.
51	00:05:47	00:05:49	You couldn't read it.
52	00:05:49	00:05:50	Shorthand?
53	00:05:50	00:05:52	Keeps things in order.
54	00:05:52	00:05:55	You're not a control freak or anything?
55	00:05:55	00:05:57	No.
56	00:05:57	00:06:00	Sara...
57	00:06:00	00:06:06	what's a homeless woman doing with a day planner and a $300 handbag?
58	00:06:06	00:06:08	That handbag costs $300?
59	00:06:08	00:06:09	Yeah.
60	00:06:10	00:06:12	How'd you know that?
61	00:06:12	00:06:14	I bought one for an ex-girlfriend once.
62	00:06:14	00:06:16	Oh.
63	00:06:18	00:06:24	Dusty, we got no hits on the fingerprints and no one fitting her description has been reported missing.
64	00:06:24	00:06:25	Oh, she's not missing?
65	00:06:25	00:06:27	She's in my world.
66	00:06:27	00:06:30	I'm just mirroring some good cheek on top of some bad cheek.
67	00:06:30	00:06:32	Okay.
68	00:06:32	00:06:35	I'll fix her forehead.
69	00:06:41	00:06:43	Her chin...
70	00:06:47	00:06:48	What a mess.
71	00:06:48	00:06:50	Mm-hmm.
72	00:06:50	00:06:52	I'm going to do a little cloning here.
73	00:06:55	00:06:57	She actually had a really nice complexion.
74	00:07:02	00:07:05	Perfect porcelain face.
75	00:07:05	00:07:07	What can you do about the hair?
76	00:07:07	00:07:08	It's a macro.
77	00:07:08	00:07:10	Whose hair do you want her to have?
78	00:07:10	00:07:12	Blonde? Courtney Love?
79	00:07:12	00:07:14	Sounds good to me.
80	00:07:14	00:07:17	Let's give her some eyes... blue.
81	00:07:19	00:07:21	I know her from somewhere.
82	00:07:21	00:07:22	You do?
83	00:07:22	00:07:24	Yeah.
84	00:07:25	00:07:27	Why are you showing me this?
85	00:07:27	00:07:34	The cover girl, Ashleigh James-- she's your girl in the shopping cart.
86	00:07:34	00:07:36	P.D.'s tracking down her agency now.
87	00:07:36	00:07:38	Somebody wanted her dead.
88	00:07:40	00:07:42	They also wanted her ugly.
89	00:07:50	00:07:53	It's called gentrification.
90	00:07:53	00:07:56	It's not doing anything to gentrify them.
91	00:07:56	00:07:57	Tell that to the mayor.
92	00:07:57	00:07:58	The landlord's on vacation.
93	00:07:59	00:08:02	It's a good thing because he's got a swimming pool in his basement.
94	00:08:02	00:08:06	Ashleigh James apartment, tub overflowed.
95	00:08:06	00:08:07	Who turned the water off?
96	00:08:07	00:08:11	The first officer on the scene found the door open.
97	00:08:11	00:08:13	After that, he didn't touch a thing.
98	00:08:13	00:08:14	Yeah, what have you got?
99	00:08:41	00:08:45	Well, narcissus would be proud.
100	00:08:45	00:08:49	Very much a woman, yet still a little girl.
101	00:08:55	00:08:59	I thought Doc Robbins said the victim's tox screen came back negative.
102	00:08:59	00:09:01	No, she wasn't a user.
103	00:09:03	00:09:07	But maybe the boyfriend was.
104	00:09:10	00:09:11	Let's hope he nicked himself.
105	00:09:14	00:09:16	Smells like mint.
106	00:09:20	00:09:21	Hey.
107	00:09:22	00:09:23	Find anything?
108	00:09:24	00:09:25	No. Nothing.
109	00:09:25	00:09:26	Anything out front?
110	00:09:26	00:09:29	Just a couple of homeless guys.
111	00:09:32	00:09:34	You, uh, you sure this is the vic's?
112	00:09:35	00:09:37	You are what you eat.
113	00:09:51	00:09:53	Blood in the sink.
114	00:09:56	00:09:58	None on the floor.
115	00:10:05	00:10:07	Enema.
116	00:10:07	00:10:10	The secret life of women.
117	00:10:10	00:10:11	Don't generalize.
118	00:10:11	00:10:14	It's not very scientific of you.
119	00:10:14	00:10:16	You're right. I'm sorry.
120	00:10:22	00:10:23	Catherine...
121	00:10:34	00:10:36	Hey.
122	00:10:39	00:10:42	Ooh, pretty girl.
123	00:10:44	00:10:48	Yeah. Dangerous being a pretty girl in this town.
124	00:10:53	00:10:57	Babe, he's not good enough for you.
125	00:10:57	00:10:59	He doesn't have the history we do.
126	00:10:59	00:11:00	You mean the world to me.
127	00:11:00	00:11:03	I know you'll live to regret this decision.
128	00:11:03	00:11:05	Mm.
129	00:12:18	00:12:21	Not exactly the victim's style.
130	00:12:24	00:12:28	What? You don't like cupcakes and candy bars?
131	00:12:28	00:12:29	Hey, Gris!
132	00:12:29	00:12:30	Grissom!
133	00:12:31	00:12:31	Hey!
134	00:12:32	00:12:33	Where's he going?
135	00:12:33	00:12:34	I don't know.
136	00:12:35	00:12:37	Somewhere.
137	00:12:37	00:12:39	Come on.
138	00:13:30	00:13:33	What are you doing here?
139	00:13:33	00:13:35	Contextualizing.
140	00:13:35	00:13:37	Shopping cart in the lab is like a lion in a zoo.
141	00:13:37	00:13:39	I needed to see it in its natural habitat.
142	00:13:41	00:13:46	How did Ashleigh James get from her loft to this underpass?
143	00:13:46	00:13:47	She didn't walk.
144	00:13:47	00:13:49	I'm pretty sure she was pushed.
145	00:13:58	00:13:59	Grissom...
146	00:13:59	00:14:02	Is that Ashleigh James?
147	00:14:05	00:14:07	She was under her own billboard.
148	00:14:08	00:14:09	Coincidence?
149	00:14:09	00:14:11	Somebody was making a point.
150	00:14:34	00:14:36	Hey.
151	00:14:36	00:14:37	You like crossword puzzles.
152	00:14:37	00:14:39	How are you at deciphering codes?
153	00:14:39	00:14:43	Aren't you putting the shopping cart before the horse?
154	00:14:43	00:14:46	In order to decipher a code you need to know the alphabet for the code.
155	00:14:46	00:14:50	In order to know the alphabet, you need to know the author.
156	00:14:53	00:14:57	So, what's the cart telling us?
157	00:14:57	00:14:59	About the victim?
158	00:14:59	00:15:04	Well, the victim had no relationship to the cart except for the fact that we found her in it.
159	00:15:04	00:15:08	I'm more interested in the person who used to call this cart home.
160	00:15:08	00:15:15	Well, aside from the leather day runner and the Kate Swan bag-- which appear to be from Ashleigh James's world-- you got mostly collectibles.
161	00:15:15	00:15:18	Newspapers, review journals, The Sun...
162	00:15:18	00:15:20	Various editions going back several months.
163	00:15:20	00:15:28	A couple of tennis rackets, a broom an umbrella, a pot I guess some kind of glove or something.
164	00:15:30	00:15:33	I stand corrected.
165	00:15:44	00:15:47	I have a feeling whoever owned this cart...
166	00:15:47	00:15:50	was an Ashleigh James fan.
167	00:15:53	00:15:55	Or a fanatic.
168	00:16:01	00:16:04	Well, it looks like lover boy isn't home.
169	00:16:04	00:16:07	Maybe he wrote her a letter and left town.
170	00:16:07	00:16:10	It's trash day.
171	00:16:10	00:16:11	I don't know, man.
172	00:16:11	00:16:13	We don't even have a warrant.
173	00:16:13	00:16:14	It's on the street.
174	00:16:15	00:16:16	It's fair game.
175	00:16:40	00:16:42	What did you find?
176	00:16:42	00:16:44	Photographic paper.
177	00:16:59	00:17:02	That's Ashleigh James.
178	00:17:18	00:17:20	The cow says moo.
179	00:17:20	00:17:21	I can hold my breath, I swear.
180	00:17:21	00:17:24	Lola, if you exhale, you'll burst the bloody seams.
181	00:17:24	00:17:26	Rod, I'm sorry. I...
182	00:17:26	00:17:28	The fitting was two days ago.
183	00:17:28	00:17:32	Are you telling me you couldn't keep your face out of the trough for 48 hours?
184	00:17:33	00:17:36	You want me to be your agent you better start doing your part, all right?
185	00:17:38	00:17:39	Rod Darling?
186	00:17:40	00:17:42	Las Vegas Police.
187	00:17:42	00:17:44	You're here about Ashleigh, right?
188	00:17:44	00:17:45	Yeah.
189	00:17:45	00:17:47	Sorry about what happened but she wasn't a client anymore.
190	00:17:47	00:17:49	I dropped her a couple of months ago.
191	00:17:49	00:17:50	Did you forget to pack?
192	00:17:51	00:17:55	We found men's clothing and personal items at her place.
193	00:17:55	00:17:57	She was a screwed up kid looking for a father figure.
194	00:17:58	00:18:00	One minute booking a photo shoot.
195	00:18:00	00:18:03	The next minute, she's screaming for Daddy.
196	00:18:06	00:18:07	You son of a bitch!
197	00:18:07	00:18:08	All right, that's enough.
198	00:18:09	00:18:09	He killed her.
199	00:18:09	00:18:11	He killed her!
200	00:18:11	00:18:12	You're a psycho!
201	00:18:14	00:18:20	Rod did everything he could to make her dependent on him and only him.
202	00:18:20	00:18:22	She shut me out.
203	00:18:22	00:18:27	Is that why you tore up her photograph and tossed it in the trash?
204	00:18:27	00:18:29	You just don't get it, do you?
205	00:18:29	00:18:30	No, I don't.
206	00:18:30	00:18:31	I mean, I don't know.
207	00:18:31	00:18:34	I care about a woman, I put her picture in a frame.
208	00:18:34	00:18:41	Maybe put it on my desk but to tear it up and throw it in the garbage with old cole slaw that just doesn't say love to me.
209	00:18:41	00:18:53	If you were in love with an amazing woman and you knew she was throwing away everything that was amazing about her on some scum...
210	00:18:53	00:18:56	would you still want her picture on your desk?
211	00:18:56	00:18:58	What did you use to cut up the picture?
212	00:18:58	00:19:00	Same knife you were waving around at Rod?
213	00:19:01	00:19:03	The same knife you used to cut up Ashleigh's face?
214	00:19:05	00:19:08	If you're suggesting I was sleeping with her, I wasn't.
215	00:19:08	00:19:10	You run out of drawer space in your place?
216	00:19:10	00:19:12	I was protecting my asset.
217	00:19:12	00:19:15	I don't know what that means.
218	00:19:16	00:19:21	You can't drive a mile in this town without seeing her face on a billboard on the side of a bus.
219	00:19:21	00:19:22	Up in lights.
220	00:19:22	00:19:28	The mantra in this business is you protect what's bankable in this business.
221	00:19:29	00:19:31	So you didn't sleep with her.
222	00:19:31	00:19:32	You just stayed over.
223	00:19:32	00:19:36	You brought a change of clothes razor blade, toothbrush, blah, blah, blah.
224	00:19:36	00:19:37	Yeah.
225	00:19:37	00:19:39	She needed constant attention, supervision.
226	00:19:39	00:19:43	Leave her alone for a minute, fill in the blank.
227	00:19:47	00:19:49	I got crabs.
228	00:19:49	00:19:51	Excuse me?
229	00:19:51	00:19:52	I got crabs.
230	00:19:52	00:19:55	Take a look.
231	00:19:59	00:20:00	Pthirus pubis.
232	00:20:01	00:20:02	Feeds on human blood.
233	00:20:02	00:20:09	They prefer the pubic and perianal regions because their legs are adapted to grasp hairs which are widely spaced.
234	00:20:09	00:20:11	They don't usually nest in clothing.
235	00:20:11	00:20:15	But when the clothing is being worn by someone with substandard personal hygiene...
236	00:20:16	00:20:18	Like one of the victim's neighbors.
237	00:20:18	00:20:25	We have a high-end handbag found in a street person's shopping cart a jacket covered in crabs in a closet full of designer clothes.
238	00:20:25	00:20:26	What does that tell us?
239	00:20:26	00:20:30	Tells me the victim not only had a visitor but that visitor was most likely homeless.
240	00:20:30	00:20:35	Tells me that whoever is missing a shopping cart is also missing his jacket.
241	00:21:02	00:21:05	Good stuff in here.
242	00:21:06	00:21:09	Hey, you got a smoke?
243	00:21:09	00:21:11	No. Sorry.
244	00:21:11	00:21:14	So, what good are you?
245	00:21:15	00:21:17	It depends.
246	00:21:17	00:21:19	Ooh, hey.
247	00:21:19	00:21:23	Don't even think that you can play me, my man.
248	00:21:23	00:21:25	I'm not playing.
249	00:21:25	00:21:28	I've got a gal named Sara, and she would love that scarf.
250	00:21:30	00:21:31	What do you say?
251	00:21:31	00:21:34	Trade me.
252	00:21:35	00:21:37	Yeah. What the hell.
253	00:21:46	00:21:48	Hey.
254	00:21:48	00:21:50	Hey, hey, Mister.
255	00:21:50	00:21:51	Hey, Mister, that is Tookie's scarf.
256	00:21:51	00:21:53	That is his scarf. I gave it to him.
257	00:21:53	00:21:54	That is Tookie's.
258	00:21:54	00:21:56	Are you a taker, or are you a giver, Mister?
259	00:21:56	00:21:57	I'm a trader.
260	00:21:57	00:22:00	I traded Tookie my jacket for this scarf.
261	00:22:02	00:22:04	Yeah, and fleas can tell time.
262	00:22:04	00:22:06	I think fleas can tell time.
263	00:22:09	00:22:11	That's a nice ring.
264	00:22:11	00:22:14	I'll trade you.
265	00:22:18	00:22:20	I'll trade you for kit, too.
266	00:22:27	00:22:30	Now I can see what the dark looks like.
267	00:22:30	00:22:33	I've been trying to do that for years.
268	00:22:41	00:22:43	Greg ran the blood on this scarf.
269	00:22:43	00:22:44	It matches the victim's.
270	00:22:44	00:22:45	How about the blood on the knife?
271	00:22:45	00:22:49	Yeah, we got a match, too, but it's not the vic's.
272	00:22:49	00:22:53	Yeah, Mcbride clipped Rod Darling's right hand during his little hissy fit.
273	00:22:53	00:22:54	Blood's his.
274	00:22:55	00:22:59	And Mcbride's knife does not match these wounds.
275	00:23:03	00:23:07	The tools were trade. The weapons of beauty.
276	00:23:07	00:23:12	Yeah. If other people inflicted as much torture as women inflict upon themselves there would be lawsuits.
277	00:23:12	00:23:16	Someone forgot to clean these, too, for a long time.
278	00:23:16	00:23:18	Positive for blood all over the place.
279	00:23:22	00:23:25	Grissom...
280	00:23:25	00:23:29	I, uh, ran the DNA on the epithelials from the homeless lady's ring.
281	00:23:29	00:23:31	It's like Prince and the Pauper.
282	00:23:32	00:23:33	No. Princess and the Pauper.
283	00:23:33	00:23:35	The princess is a dead supermodel.
284	00:23:35	00:23:36	Yeah.
285	00:23:36	00:23:39	And her pauper sister could be the killer.
286	00:23:41	00:23:43	Hot dog?
287	00:23:49	00:23:51	Relish?
288	00:23:51	00:23:55	Mm... with all those preservatives, no, no, no.
289	00:23:55	00:23:59	I-I don't want to be preserved, thank you very much. No.
290	00:23:59	00:24:02	I mean, I mean do you know what-what relish can do to your insides, huh?
291	00:24:02	00:24:04	I'd have to investigate.
292	00:24:04	00:24:06	Yeah, well, you know, you should.
293	00:24:06	00:24:09	I mean, you know because our insides-- they can kill us.
294	00:24:09	00:24:11	So, you're pretty careful about what you eat?
295	00:24:12	00:24:17	Yeah, you know, you-you have to be careful, you know 'cause what goes down, you know it's got to come out.
296	00:24:17	00:24:19	It's got to come up.
297	00:24:19	00:24:20	Out.
298	00:24:21	00:24:23	Newton's theory twisted again.
299	00:24:24	00:24:26	Everybody's twisted.
300	00:24:29	00:24:31	How about your sister?
301	00:24:31	00:24:33	My-my sister didn't have a sister.
302	00:24:33	00:24:35	Protein's good, you know?
303	00:24:35	00:24:36	C-carbs are bad.
304	00:24:36	00:24:37	This is bad.
305	00:24:37	00:24:38	That's bad.
306	00:24:43	00:24:46	Hey, Cassie, you know that scarf you gave Tookie?
307	00:24:47	00:24:49	Yeah, I know it.
308	00:24:49	00:24:52	Did your sister give that to you, or...
309	00:24:52	00:24:54	did you steal it from her?
310	00:24:54	00:24:58	I should have stole it.
311	00:24:58	00:25:01	Because sh-sh-she stole from me.
312	00:25:02	00:25:04	What did she steal from you?
313	00:25:04	00:25:08	My life.
314	00:25:13	00:25:15	I admit I gave up on Cassie.
315	00:25:15	00:25:16	Washed my hands.
316	00:25:16	00:25:19	Ashleigh was the only one who still gave a damn.
317	00:25:19	00:25:22	Get together with her every couple of weeks.
318	00:25:22	00:25:25	Make sure she had a decent meal, shower, clothes on her back.
319	00:25:25	00:25:26	And what did you do for her?
320	00:25:26	00:25:28	Let me tell you something.
321	00:25:28	00:25:30	For every piece of meat, there has to be a butcher.
322	00:25:32	00:25:33	So, you led her to the slaughter?
323	00:25:33	00:25:34	Free will.
324	00:25:34	00:25:37	Recognize this one?
325	00:25:39	00:25:42	That's Cassie.
326	00:25:42	00:25:44	It's the homeless sister.
327	00:25:44	00:25:47	How long ago was this taken?
328	00:25:47	00:25:48	Three years.
329	00:25:48	00:25:50	See, Cassie got deep into freebase.
330	00:25:50	00:25:54	No shortage of sleazebags around to keep her supplied.
331	00:25:54	00:25:57	I knew she had the sister in Wichita Falls.
332	00:25:57	00:25:58	All right, Cassie, let's go.
333	00:25:58	00:26:00	Come on, chin up.
334	00:26:00	00:26:02	Colin, will you get in there and get her hair out of her face?
335	00:26:03	00:26:04	Don't touch me!
336	00:26:04	00:26:06	I hate this!
337	00:26:06	00:26:07	I hate this place!
338	00:26:07	00:26:08	I hate it!
339	00:26:08	00:26:09	I hate my life!
340	00:26:09	00:26:10	Get away from me!
341	00:26:19	00:26:23	One look... that was it.
342	00:26:23	00:26:25	Camera ate her up.
343	00:26:25	00:26:28	So, in Cassie's mind, she was a victim here.
344	00:26:28	00:26:30	Makes sense that she'd be angry.
345	00:26:30	00:26:32	Angry was five flights up.
346	00:26:32	00:26:33	Cassie was an obsessed basehead.
347	00:26:33	00:26:35	Cocaine already had her paranoid.
348	00:26:35	00:26:40	Once Ashleigh started modeling everything became this big conspiracy.
349	00:26:40	00:26:43	Naturally, yours truly was Satan.
350	00:26:43	00:26:47	Cassie threw her life away and her sister Ashleigh recycled it.
351	00:26:47	00:26:49	It's like a crossword puzzle, isn't it?
352	00:26:49	00:26:51	Once you pick it up, you can't put it down.
353	00:26:51	00:26:53	And go home? No way.
354	00:26:53	00:26:56	You know, this Day Runner belonged to Ashleigh.
355	00:26:56	00:26:57	BFJ3.
356	00:26:57	00:26:59	Bellagio fountain.
357	00:27:02	00:27:05	J3? Date?
358	00:27:05	00:27:07	January 3rd? June 3rd? July 3rd?
359	00:27:07	00:27:09	Uh, third J month, July?
360	00:27:09	00:27:11	That's what I thought at first.
361	00:27:11	00:27:13	Parking space in a parking garage?
362	00:27:14	00:27:17	Nope. Once you pick it up, you can't put it down.
363	00:27:17	00:27:19	J3... J3...
364	00:27:19	00:27:20	City or state grid map?
365	00:27:20	00:27:22	You're cold.
366	00:27:22	00:27:25	What's one thing a model always knows?
367	00:27:26	00:27:27	Who's shooting her.
368	00:27:27	00:27:28	Three Js. Jay Jay Jarrett.
369	00:27:28	00:27:30	Who?
370	00:27:30	00:27:31	Famous photographer.
371	00:27:32	00:27:35	Ashleigh James's employment contracts for the last year.
372	00:27:35	00:27:38	And, as an aside she stopped working two months ago.
373	00:27:38	00:27:40	Why?
374	00:27:40	00:27:42	Good question.
375	00:27:43	00:27:46	Maybe the answer is in one of these pages.
376	00:27:51	00:27:55	Nobody could blame you for being mad, Cassie.
377	00:27:55	00:28:00	I mean, your sister took your career and you wanted to get back at her.
378	00:28:00	00:28:03	If you couldn't have success, she couldn't either.
379	00:28:03	00:28:04	Isn't that right?
380	00:28:04	00:28:08	The v-victims have victims, too.
381	00:28:08	00:28:10	So, which one of you is the victim?
382	00:28:10	00:28:14	I-I know... you know, I know, I tried to warn her.
383	00:28:14	00:28:17	About the in-in and-and outing and the... and the pick-pick.
384	00:28:18	00:28:20	And the-and the and the counting the counting and the counting.
385	00:28:20	00:28:21	I mean, I did, I tried.
386	00:28:22	00:28:24	That's why I tried to really, really save her.
387	00:28:24	00:28:25	I mean, I tried to save her.
388	00:28:25	00:28:26	You tried to save her?
389	00:28:26	00:28:27	Your sister?
390	00:28:27	00:28:29	Right. She could never be, you know...
391	00:28:29	00:28:31	she could never be... pretty enough.
392	00:28:31	00:28:35	And she could never b-be... skinny enough.
393	00:28:35	00:28:38	And sh-she could never be... perfect enough.
394	00:28:38	00:28:41	And sh-she could never be any-anything enough.
395	00:28:44	00:28:45	Hey, fat girl.
396	00:28:45	00:28:48	I got what you need.
397	00:28:48	00:28:51	I got it.
398	00:28:58	00:28:59	One more.
399	00:29:00	00:29:02	Good girl.
400	00:29:02	00:29:03	Mm.
401	00:29:03	00:29:05	I mean, that's why I did, I did.
402	00:29:05	00:29:07	I tried to stop her.
403	00:29:07	00:29:09	I tried to stop her.
404	00:29:11	00:29:14	I tried to stop.
405	00:29:23	00:29:25	She's a needle freak.
406	00:29:26	00:29:28	She doesn't know what she's talking about.
407	00:29:28	00:29:29	Yes, she does.
408	00:29:31	00:29:34	You tried to stop yourself, didn't you?
409	00:29:34	00:29:35	But you couldn't.
410	00:29:37	00:29:39	It's you! It's you!
411	00:29:39	00:29:40	It's you!
412	00:29:40	00:29:42	You! You!
413	00:29:43	00:29:45	All right, read her her rights.
414	00:29:56	00:29:59	I found blisters in the back of her throat.
415	00:29:59	00:30:01	What? Forced oral?
416	00:30:01	00:30:07	That's what I thought until I noticed worn enamel on the tooth.
417	00:30:08	00:30:12	In conjunction with this red mark on the knuckle of her middle finger.
418	00:30:12	00:30:16	Which made me realize it wasn't sexual abuse.
419	00:30:16	00:30:19	Eating disorder.
420	00:30:22	00:30:25	She was bulimic and anorexic.
421	00:30:25	00:30:28	Which explains the down on her skin.
422	00:30:28	00:30:30	Lanugo.
423	00:30:30	00:30:34	Characteristic of premature babies and anorexics.
424	00:30:34	00:30:36	She doesn't seem that skinny.
425	00:30:37	00:30:38	Not this week.
426	00:30:38	00:30:41	Last week, or the week before, who knows?
427	00:30:41	00:30:43	Binge-and-purge.
428	00:30:43	00:30:45	Till her entire system is in a state of shock.
429	00:30:45	00:30:46	You know what's next.
430	00:30:46	00:30:48	Body starts feeding on its own muscle.
431	00:30:48	00:30:50	Is that what killed her?
432	00:30:50	00:30:54	Uh, starvation and purging weaken the immune system.
433	00:30:54	00:30:59	failed kidney, fueled by septicemia.
434	00:30:59	00:31:01	Blood infection.
435	00:31:01	00:31:04	Caused by the injuries to her face?
436	00:31:04	00:31:07	Probably, but she's been septic for at least a month.
437	00:31:07	00:31:10	She has anemia borne of chronic disease.
438	00:31:10	00:31:12	Her red cell count's low, iron's low.
439	00:31:12	00:31:14	ESR is extremely high.
440	00:31:14	00:31:17	So she didn't just die.
441	00:31:17	00:31:19	She's been dying for a long time.
442	00:31:33	00:31:35	What do you know that's good?
443	00:31:37	00:31:39	Cassie James's psych profile.
444	00:31:42	00:31:45	Classic paranoid schizophrenic.
445	00:31:45	00:31:48	Which explains why the interrogation room was too hard on her.
446	00:31:48	00:31:53	For schizophrenics, you know, the tighter the space the more unbearable the feelings tend to be.
447	00:31:53	00:31:57	Well, if you ask me that's not the only psych evaluation we need.
448	00:31:57	00:31:58	Ashleigh James?
449	00:31:58	00:31:59	That poor girl.
450	00:31:59	00:32:03	Definitely lacking in the self-image department.
451	00:32:03	00:32:07	She suffered from septicemia, indicative of chronic abuse.
452	00:32:07	00:32:13	But... what if Cassie wasn't the one who inflicted Ashleigh's facial wounds?
453	00:32:13	00:32:17	Well, we know it's not the ex-boyfriend-- no evidence.
454	00:32:17	00:32:20	Not the agent-- wouldn't jeopardize an asset.
455	00:32:20	00:32:24	And if it's not Cassie, who's left?
456	00:32:24	00:32:26	I don't know.
457	00:32:47	00:32:51	T 3. 1834 BC.
458	00:32:52	00:32:54	48 BF.
459	00:33:16	00:33:18	T 3...
460	00:33:18	00:33:22	1834 BC...
461	00:33:22	00:33:25	48 BF.
462	00:33:33	00:33:38	2 evo'd... 8G...
463	00:33:38	00:33:40	1 TU.
464	00:33:46	00:33:49	You must have been so desperate.
465	00:33:51	00:33:53	Cassie James's prints from Booking on the left.
466	00:33:54	00:33:56	Prints from the loft faucet on the right.
467	00:33:56	00:33:58	Do we have a prom date?
468	00:34:04	00:34:06	All right, well...
469	00:34:10	00:34:14	Cassie James was definitely in her sister's apartment.
470	00:34:16	00:34:19	Hey, man. What you eatin'?
471	00:34:19	00:34:20	Little college cuisine.
472	00:34:21	00:34:22	That stuff will kill you, you know.
473	00:34:22	00:34:24	Hasn't killed me yet.
474	00:34:24	00:34:27	Grego, find any time between meals to check out Grissom's scrapings?
475	00:34:28	00:34:30	You mean Ashleigh's fingernail scrapings?
476	00:34:30	00:34:31	Yeah. Yeah.
477	00:34:31	00:34:32	And?
478	00:34:33	00:34:34	Got a match.
479	00:34:34	00:34:36	To Cassie, her sister.
480	00:34:36	00:34:37	No. To the vic.
481	00:34:37	00:34:38	Ashleigh?
482	00:34:39	00:34:41	Yeah. The DNA under her fingernails was her own.
483	00:34:42	00:34:43	Excuse me.
484	00:34:45	00:34:49	So what I realized was bulimia is a zero sum disease.
485	00:34:49	00:34:53	That's why she has a plus sign over here and a minus sign over there.
486	00:34:53	00:34:57	Whatever went in had to be exactly canceled by what went out.
487	00:34:59	00:35:01	Body Dysmorphic Disorder.
488	00:35:01	00:35:04	Yes. One theory suggests it's neurobiological.
489	00:35:04	00:35:14	Another psychological-- that people with extreme sexual or emotional anxiety unconsciously displace their feelings into the arena of appearance, because it's more manageable.
490	00:35:14	00:35:16	You feel like crap, blame your face.
491	00:35:17	00:35:21	Or your skin, or your hair or that zit on your forehead.
492	00:35:21	00:35:22	I knew this dancer.
493	00:35:22	00:35:26	Every night she'd stare at herself in the mirror for three hours.
494	00:35:26	00:35:31	Meticulous grooming, when a person suffers from BDD becomes a destructive compulsion.
495	00:35:31	00:35:37	There's one line in her daybook that keeps repeating over and over I'm not even.
496	00:35:37	00:35:40	So you're saying she knew she was slipping.
497	00:35:40	00:35:42	No. She literally means even.
498	00:35:42	00:35:46	A large number of BDD sufferers are convinced that they're not symmetric.
499	00:35:46	00:35:49	That one side of their body or their face doesn't match the other.
500	00:35:49	00:35:51	All animals prefer symmetry in their mates.
501	00:35:51	00:35:56	The male Japanese scorpion flies with the most symmetrical wings gets the most mates.
502	00:35:56	00:36:00	So, really we're not talking about being beautiful at all.
503	00:36:00	00:36:02	In terms of entomology being beautiful is about being even.
504	00:36:02	00:36:05	It signals the fitness to procreate.
505	00:36:05	00:36:07	So, we're not really talking about looks.
506	00:36:07	00:36:10	We're talking about survival of the species?
507	00:36:12	00:36:14	control and perfectionism.
508	00:36:14	00:36:16	That's what her code was all about.
509	00:36:19	00:36:28	Let's take HBWC/3, 1590 BC, 90 BF, 3930 S, 114 TC.
510	00:36:28	00:36:30	Three hamburgers with cheese.
511	00:36:30	00:36:31	Content 530.
512	00:36:31	00:36:35	530 times three is where she gets 1590 BC.
513	00:36:35	00:36:38	That's BC for bad calories.
514	00:36:38	00:36:42	And at 30 grams a pop 90 grams of BF.
515	00:36:42	00:36:43	Bad fat?
516	00:36:43	00:36:44	Yeah.
517	00:36:44	00:36:50	The rest of her formula involves sodium, total carbohydrates and the actual weight of everything she ate.
518	00:36:51	00:36:53	And so, she was, uh...
519	00:36:53	00:36:57	operating like a scientist seeking a perfect formula to take her pain away.
520	00:36:57	00:37:00	Or disappear altogether.
521	00:37:00	00:37:02	Which brings me to the minus side of her equation.
522	00:37:02	00:37:08	She would write down the number of times she t'u'd, threw up, in this case twice-- or evo'd.
523	00:37:08	00:37:10	Evo'd?
524	00:37:10	00:37:12	Moving her bowels.
525	00:37:12	00:37:15	The directions on her disposable enema box use the term evacuate.
526	00:37:15	00:37:22	So, after her burger binge she 3 evo'd, 14 G, 2 t'u'd, 9 G, 3 #1.
527	00:37:22	00:37:27	She evo'd three times but her calculations didn't stop there.
528	00:37:27	00:37:29	G stands for grams.
529	00:37:36	00:37:37	14 gram... wait a minute.
530	00:37:37	00:37:39	You're telling me that she weighed her bowel?
531	00:37:40	00:37:41	Yeah.
532	00:37:41	00:37:43	We bagged it.
533	00:37:47	00:37:51	Input and output down to the last quarter gram.
534	00:37:51	00:37:57	Well, that makes sense why the blood and skin under Ashleigh James's fingernails is a perfect match to Ashleigh James.
535	00:37:57	00:37:59	She attacked herself.
536	00:38:00	00:38:05	I mean, Ashleigh was convinced that everything about her needed to be fixed.
537	00:38:05	00:38:07	The real problem was inside her head.
538	00:38:07	00:38:09	She couldn't deal with that so she tried to fix the outside.
539	00:38:09	00:38:13	Hence, the digging and picking and purging and bleeding.
540	00:38:13	00:38:14	To us, it would be torture.
541	00:38:14	00:38:18	To her... some sort of release.
542	00:38:18	00:38:22	Which is why Rod cut her loose.
543	00:38:22	00:38:24	She was no longer bankable.
544	00:38:24	00:38:27	Also why Frank was so angry at Rod.
545	00:38:28	00:38:30	Yeah, he destroyed Frank's vision of her.
546	00:38:30	00:38:34	So the victim and the killer became one and the same.
547	00:38:34	00:38:43	The very nature of addiction-- whether it be self-medicating herself or self-mutilating-- is that the very behavior we use to survive it becomes a behavior that ends up killing us.
548	00:38:43	00:38:50	But wait, that still doesn't answer how Ashleigh ended up in a shopping cart by the freeway.
549	00:38:50	00:38:53	Well, the fingerprints explain that.
550	00:39:14	00:39:17	I think Cassie was trying to take care of her sister.
551	00:39:18	00:39:21	She pushed her to a place where she thought she'd be safe.
552	00:39:21	00:39:26	Where she thought she could see herself for how beautiful she really was.
553	00:39:35	00:39:38	What happened to these girls?
554	00:39:48	00:39:52	I'm sorry about your sister, Cassie.
555	00:39:52	00:39:54	The dead don't bleed.
556	00:39:54	00:39:58	True. Death does have some advantages.
557	00:40:00	00:40:02	Would you like me to help you get into a shelter?
558	00:40:02	00:40:04	No, I would need a shelter from a shelter.
559	00:40:04	00:40:10	No, no, no. Out here, I can hunt and I can range and I can find the things that I need out here.
560	00:40:10	00:40:13	I mean, you never know what you need until you find it.
561	00:40:13	00:40:16	Or until you lose it.
562	00:40:19	00:40:23	I mean, all we are is what we try to get rid of.
563	00:40:23	00:40:27	Fat and newspapers and loneliness and cat food cans.
564	00:40:27	00:40:32	And there are going-away people and there are left-behind people but, you know, everybody's secrets...
565	00:40:32	00:40:34	everybody's secrets are the same.
566	00:40:34	00:40:36	Were you and your sister's secrets the same?
567	00:40:37	00:40:38	My sister didn't have secrets.
568	00:40:38	00:40:40	Her secrets had her.
569	00:40:40	00:40:43	That... I told you I didn't... I don't know.
570	00:40:43	00:40:48	I mean, you know, y-y-you-you can pick through a million lives and never have one of your own.
571	00:40:51	00:40:56	Looking for things, analyzing them...
572	00:40:56	00:41:00	trying to figure out the world-- that's a life.
573	00:41:00	00:41:03	You never know what you need until you find it.
574	00:41:03	00:41:09	And the next thing I find it might be the thing that changes everything.
575	00:41:09	00:41:13	What will you do when you find it?
576	00:41:13	00:41:16	Sleep...
577	00:41:16	00:41:19	the most perfect sleep.
578	00:42:33	00:42:38	Obviously most of crime scene investigation is about seeing.
579	00:42:38	00:42:40	But much of it is about hearing as well.
580	00:42:41	00:42:42	Listening.
581	00:42:42	00:42:43	Knowing how to listen.
582	00:42:43	00:42:47	Not just to what people are saying but how they say it.
583	00:42:47	00:42:53	How their tone of voice matches their facial expressions or body posture.
584	00:42:53	00:42:58	So, even if I read lips and know what they're saying...
585	00:42:58	00:43:01	it's not enough.
586	00:43:02	00:43:06	We're both scientists, Mr. Grissom so let me tell you the science.
587	00:43:07	00:43:09	You've got otosclerosis.
588	00:43:10	00:43:15	Basically, this means a bony growth has begun to form around the base of the stapes.
589	00:43:15	00:43:25	What this does is prevent the stapes from moving and passing vibrations to the inner ear effectively neutralizing sound waves.
590	00:43:25	00:43:27	It's hereditary-- my mother.
591	00:43:27	00:43:29	Most doctors think so.
592	00:43:29	00:43:36	But there's no way to know when it's going to show up and there's no way to reverse it once it does.
593	00:43:36	00:43:38	Right.
594	00:43:42	00:43:43	How long do you think?
595	00:43:45	00:43:47	I don't have that answer.
