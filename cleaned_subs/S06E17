2,00:01:21,00:01:25,(gasping)
3,00:01:48,00:01:49,CURTIS: Vic's name's Christina Hollis.
4,00:01:49,00:01:51,She's a sales agent for the building.
5,00:01:51,00:01:55,"Neighbor said she just came running out of her unit, delirious and hysterical."
6,00:01:55,00:01:56,Sexual assault?
7,00:01:57,00:01:58,Definitely.
8,00:01:58,00:02:01,"I'm gonna go with her to the hospital, see if I can get a statement."
9,00:02:06,00:02:07,GRISSOM: Video cameras.
10,00:02:07,00:02:09,That's good for us.
11,00:02:09,00:02:11,"Vic probably thought it was good for her, too."
12,00:02:11,00:02:14,"Excuse me, hi, can you identify yourself for the camera, please?"
13,00:02:14,00:02:15,PRODUCER: Just look right in the lens.
14,00:02:16,00:02:17,What is this? It's a reality crime show.
15,00:02:17,00:02:19,We're following you for this investigation.
16,00:02:19,00:02:21,Sheriff promised full cooperation.
17,00:02:21,00:02:23,We got that memo. They'reHard Crime.
18,00:02:23,00:02:28,That's us-- we're the guys who put the folks who look in the microscopes under the microscopes.
19,00:02:28,00:02:29,Right.
20,00:02:29,00:02:31,"You see, it's good P.R. for the department."
21,00:02:31,00:02:33,"Try not to bust their chops, okay?"
22,00:02:33,00:02:35,PRODUCER: You ever see the show? It's got a lot of forensics.
23,00:02:35,00:02:37,There's too many forensics shows on TV.
24,00:02:41,00:02:44,"BRASS: The door knob, the frame, the strike plate are all clean."
25,00:02:44,00:02:46,No sign of a forced entry.
26,00:02:46,00:02:48,So she might have known her assailant.
27,00:02:48,00:02:51,Either that or he talked his way in.
28,00:02:52,00:02:54,"Hey, hey, hey."
29,00:02:54,00:02:56,Stay behind the crime tape.
30,00:02:56,00:02:57,PRODUCER: Don't cut.
31,00:03:17,00:03:22,"Mr. Grissom, can you please describe what you're seeing?"
32,00:03:22,00:03:24,A long night.
33,00:03:59,00:04:03,I don't understand.
34,00:04:06,00:04:08,Why am I here?
35,00:04:08,00:04:13,"Miss Hollis, you've been assaulted."
36,00:04:15,00:04:16,Who...?
37,00:04:16,00:04:18,I...
38,00:04:19,00:04:23,You don't know who did this?
39,00:04:23,00:04:25,What was the last thing you remember?
40,00:04:34,00:04:37,I don't know.
41,00:04:39,00:04:41,"Oh, my God."
42,00:04:42,00:04:46,"Oh, my God."
43,00:04:48,00:04:51,"Okay, this isn't right."
44,00:04:51,00:04:53,Why isn't this right?
45,00:04:53,00:04:54,Why don't I look right?
46,00:04:54,00:04:55,"Christina, it's okay."
47,00:04:55,00:04:56,"No, it's not okay."
48,00:04:56,00:04:57,It's not okay.
49,00:04:57,00:05:01,Why don't I look right?
50,00:05:01,00:05:04,I don't underst...
51,00:05:04,00:05:05,Why are they st...
52,00:05:05,00:05:07,Why are they staring at me?
53,00:05:07,00:05:09,Stop looking at me!
54,00:05:09,00:05:11,"Nurse, get in here! (sobbing)"
55,00:05:11,00:05:14,It's okay. It's okay.
56,00:05:14,00:05:15,(sobbing)
57,00:05:15,00:05:19,NURSE: I did a wet mount from a vaginal swab and got 4-plus motile sperm present.
58,00:05:19,00:05:22,So she was raped within the last few hours.
59,00:05:22,00:05:26,No condom means he's not in the system or he doesn't care if he gets caught.
60,00:05:26,00:05:27,"Guys like this, they keep doing it."
61,00:05:27,00:05:28,"PRODUCER: Excuse me, Detective."
62,00:05:28,00:05:30,Can I ask you a question?
63,00:05:30,00:05:31,Detective.
64,00:05:31,00:05:33,You try something like that again and you're gone.
65,00:05:33,00:05:35,I don't a give a damn what the sheriff says.
66,00:05:36,00:05:38,We never put anyone on screen without a signed release.
67,00:05:38,00:05:40,You invaded her privacy at her most vulnerable moment.
68,00:05:40,00:05:42,I am trying to give the crime a face.
69,00:05:42,00:05:45,"Yeah, well, we're going to lose an hour waiting for her to calm down."
70,00:05:45,00:05:46,That's on you.
71,00:05:46,00:05:48,I apologize. It won't happen again.
72,00:05:48,00:05:50,"Look, can I just ask you what you've got there?"
73,00:05:50,00:05:53,It's a sexual assault evidence kit and blood sample.
74,00:05:53,00:05:56,I've seen date rape victims in similar dissociative states.
75,00:05:56,00:05:59,"We're going to run a tox screen, see if she was drugged."
76,00:05:59,00:06:00,"You were a CSI, right?"
77,00:06:00,00:06:01,Yeah.
78,00:06:01,00:06:03,And now you're a detective.
79,00:06:03,00:06:05,So which side of the fence do you prefer?
80,00:06:05,00:06:07,It's the same side.
81,00:06:10,00:06:12,(camera clicking)
82,00:06:30,00:06:33,(camera clicking)
83,00:06:37,00:06:40,(camera clicks)
84,00:06:47,00:06:50,(camera clicks)
85,00:06:50,00:06:52,WILLOWS: Candles burned down.
86,00:06:52,00:06:53,A bouquet in the trash.
87,00:06:53,00:06:55,(camera clicking)
88,00:06:55,00:06:59,Flowers and candles-- sure seems like a date.
89,00:06:59,00:07:01,Some date.
90,00:07:06,00:07:07,(camera clicks)
91,00:07:11,00:07:14,There's a void in the wax.
92,00:07:31,00:07:34,Some kind of white flaky substance.
93,00:07:47,00:07:49,"This looks like blood, but..."
94,00:07:57,00:07:59,I think it's nail polish.
95,00:08:11,00:08:13,"BRASS: Hey, how's it going?"
96,00:08:16,00:08:20,"According to your supervisor, you were doing maintenance work on the 11th floor at 5:00 a.m."
97,00:08:20,00:08:23,What were you fixing at 5:00 in the morning?
98,00:08:23,00:08:26,I was just clocking a little overtime.
99,00:08:27,00:08:32,"Management said they wanted a few extra coats of paint on three, seven and 11."
100,00:08:32,00:08:35,Got to keep everything nice and pretty for the tenants.
101,00:08:35,00:08:38,"You know, the security guy didn't see you on his camera. Why is that?"
102,00:08:38,00:08:41,"Yeah, well, that guy doesn't see much."
103,00:08:41,00:08:42,Service elevator's out.
104,00:08:42,00:08:44,We have to use the stairs.
105,00:08:44,00:08:47,God forbid the tenants ever have to look at one of us.
106,00:08:47,00:08:49,You got a master key to all the apartments?
107,00:08:49,00:08:50,Yeah.
108,00:08:51,00:08:55,But we only go in if a tenant specifically asks us to fix something.
109,00:08:55,00:08:57,You ever fix anything for Christina Hollis?
110,00:08:57,00:08:59,Nope. Never.
111,00:09:09,00:09:12,"You're running a little low on duct tape, my man."
112,00:09:12,00:09:14,Yeah.
113,00:09:14,00:09:16,It's holding up half the building.
114,00:09:26,00:09:30,"Two pieces of duct tape, both have been swabbed for DNA and fingerprinted."
115,00:09:31,00:09:32,Grissom wants you to compare adhesives.
116,00:09:32,00:09:34,He's looking for a match.
117,00:09:34,00:09:36,Okay.
118,00:09:36,00:09:37,That'll take a laser ablation test.
119,00:09:38,00:09:39,That's good.
120,00:09:39,00:09:40,Why's that good?
121,00:09:40,00:09:45,"Well, laser ablation is both visual and dramatic."
122,00:09:45,00:09:48,Are you looking for the video crew right now?
123,00:09:48,00:09:51,I would think that they would be looking for me.
124,00:09:51,00:09:54,"Relax, man, the show's only an hour long."
125,00:09:54,00:09:57,"Laser ablation takes, like, six."
126,00:09:57,00:10:00,"Yeah, but when they cut it together, it'll only take 30 seconds."
127,00:10:41,00:10:44,HODGES: Ran laser ablation on the duct tape samples.
128,00:10:44,00:10:45,Not a match.
129,00:10:45,00:10:48,So she wasn't tied up with the maintenance man's tape.
130,00:10:48,00:10:50,Mm-mm. What about the rest of the trace?
131,00:10:50,00:10:54,"White powder was primarily biological, so I kicked it back to DNA."
132,00:10:54,00:10:56,It did contain some glassy particles.
133,00:10:56,00:10:58,Might be industrial diamonds.
134,00:10:58,00:10:59,And the yellow reflective flakes?
135,00:10:59,00:11:02,My next priority.
136,00:11:02,00:11:05,(scoffs) That's a waste of film.
137,00:11:05,00:11:09,"JOHNSON: The victim came out of her apartment around 5:00 a.m., so I've been working my way back from then."
138,00:11:09,00:11:16,"In the previous seven hours, 37 people came and went from the 11th floor, 21 of them male."
139,00:11:16,00:11:19,So the assailant could be any one of them...
140,00:11:19,00:11:22,"assuming that our guy didn't take the stairs which, of course, aren't monitored."
141,00:11:23,00:11:28,"Okay, now, here: This guy got off on the vic's floor at 10:32 p.m."
142,00:11:28,00:11:30,There's no footage of him coming back down.
143,00:11:30,00:11:32,And check this out.
144,00:11:32,00:11:35,(beeping)
145,00:11:38,00:11:39,He brought flowers.
146,00:11:39,00:11:41,How romantic.
147,00:11:41,00:11:44,But I don't think this was a first date.
148,00:11:51,00:11:54,(beeping)
149,00:11:54,00:11:56,Guy had his own key.
150,00:11:56,00:11:59,So he could've been with the victim the whole night.
151,00:11:59,00:12:03,"Pull the best image of his face you can, and get a printout to Brass."
152,00:12:03,00:12:04,I'm on it.
153,00:12:04,00:12:06,"PRODUCER: Ms. Willows, hold on a second."
154,00:12:06,00:12:08,All you have is a guy's face.
155,00:12:08,00:12:11,How do you figure out who he is?
156,00:12:11,00:12:13,Good question.
157,00:12:18,00:12:20,"PRODUCER: Guys, we're good to go."
158,00:12:20,00:12:24,(clears throat)
159,00:12:24,00:12:26,So what have you found so far?
160,00:12:26,00:12:29,I lifted two identifiable prints off the bouquet wrapper.
161,00:12:30,00:12:32,How do you know they belong to the suspect?
162,00:12:32,00:12:42,"We don't, but one matched a print found on the duct tape, right here, used to tape up the victim."
163,00:12:42,00:12:45,"Unfortunately, that print's not in our database."
164,00:12:45,00:12:48,So your suspect doesn't have a record?
165,00:12:49,00:12:50,"Apparently not, no."
166,00:12:50,00:12:53,"Well, how do you find a guy who's not in the system?"
167,00:12:53,00:12:57,"(chuckles) You just got to get creative, you know?"
168,00:12:57,00:13:04,"I mean, the flowers... came from a small shop off-strip."
169,00:13:04,00:13:08,"Took the suspect's image to the clerk, showed it to him."
170,00:13:08,00:13:09,He gave me a credit card receipt.
171,00:13:10,00:13:12,"From that receipt, I got a name."
172,00:13:12,00:13:15,That name gave me a driver's license.
173,00:13:15,00:13:17,Dwight Reynolds.
174,00:13:17,00:13:19,Police are bringing him in now.
175,00:13:19,00:13:21,"Great, okay."
176,00:13:21,00:13:23,"Clear and concise, thank you. Thanks."
177,00:13:23,00:13:25,"Yeah, well, we have to do it in court all the time."
178,00:13:25,00:13:31,"If you can't explain it to a jury, then the bad guy usually walks, and we don't like it when the bad guy walks."
179,00:13:31,00:13:33,CURTIS: Unit picked him up at the Double Down.
180,00:13:33,00:13:34,He was plastered.
181,00:13:34,00:13:36,BRASS: What'd he blow?
182,00:13:36,00:13:38,One nine.
183,00:13:38,00:13:40,That's almost enough to wash away your sins.
184,00:13:40,00:13:42,"Well, we're going to have wait until he sobers up."
185,00:13:42,00:13:44,"No, no, let's not wait, let's move on this."
186,00:13:44,00:13:46,I think we got a chance.
187,00:13:46,00:13:49,"Look, why don't you come in there with me, huh?"
188,00:13:49,00:13:51,Maybe pop a few buttons?
189,00:13:51,00:13:53,"(chuckles) No, seriously."
190,00:13:53,00:13:55,See how he reacts.
191,00:13:55,00:13:59,"If he tries too hard not to look, it could be a guilty conscience?"
192,00:13:59,00:14:01,"Yeah, maybe, something like that."
193,00:14:01,00:14:06,"If he is the guy, and we interview him now, anything he says could be thrown out of court."
194,00:14:06,00:14:08,It's worth a try.
195,00:14:08,00:14:13,"What do you think, huh?"
196,00:14:13,00:14:16,Let's go.
197,00:14:22,00:14:25,How's it going?
198,00:14:25,00:14:26,Okay.
199,00:14:26,00:14:28,Did you know a Christina Hollis?
200,00:14:28,00:14:31,"Yeah, we used to date."
201,00:14:31,00:14:33,You seen her recently?
202,00:14:33,00:14:37,No. Then how come we found your prints on some flowers at her place?
203,00:14:37,00:14:41,I dropped some flowers off... but I didn't see her when I did.
204,00:14:41,00:14:42,You had a key?
205,00:14:42,00:14:44,Yeah.
206,00:14:44,00:14:46,"She likes me to come over sometimes, you know?"
207,00:14:47,00:14:48,Help her move stuff.
208,00:14:58,00:15:00,"Oh, come on, what really happened, huh?"
209,00:15:00,00:15:05,"You went over to move some stuff, and she wasn't in the mood, is that it?"
210,00:15:05,00:15:08,I told you-- I didn't see her.
211,00:15:13,00:15:15,(door rattling)
212,00:15:15,00:15:20,(Barry White song playing inside)
213,00:15:22,00:15:26,She was playing Barry White.
214,00:15:26,00:15:27,Everybody knows what that means.
215,00:15:29,00:15:32,I guess it wasn't my night. You're lying!
216,00:15:34,00:15:37,"We found the flowers inside her apartment, in the trash, and you didn't use the elevator to leave."
217,00:15:37,00:15:39,I was pissed.
218,00:15:40,00:15:41,I tried to walk it off.
219,00:15:41,00:15:45,"I figured 11 flights down, it's better than a cold shower."
220,00:15:45,00:15:50,Christina Hollis was tied up and brutally assaulted in her apartment last night.
221,00:15:50,00:15:51,What?
222,00:15:51,00:15:52,And you were there.
223,00:15:53,00:15:54,Is she...?
224,00:15:55,00:15:56,She's alive and talking.
225,00:15:56,00:15:58,Last night?
226,00:15:58,00:16:01,The guy who with her was...
227,00:16:01,00:16:03,was doing that to her?
228,00:16:08,00:16:10,I could've stopped it.
229,00:16:14,00:16:18,SIMMS: So the powder that you found on the bedroom floor was actually keratinized skin cells.
230,00:16:18,00:16:21,"They belong to the vic, and morphology suggests that they're probably from her cuticles."
231,00:16:22,00:16:23,Cuticles? Mm-hmm.
232,00:16:23,00:16:24,"Nail polish, diamond particles..."
233,00:16:24,00:16:28,Maybe she was giving herself a mani and pedi before the assault.
234,00:16:29,00:16:34,"I don't know about you, but if I could afford to live in an apartment like that, I'd be in a spa every week."
235,00:16:34,00:16:35,"Yeah, I hear you there. Thank you."
236,00:16:35,00:16:36,Mm-hmm.
237,00:16:38,00:16:41,"Wendy ran the semen, no hits in CODIS."
238,00:16:42,00:16:46,"Yeah, the, uh... ex-boyfriend didn't match any of the prints on the duct tape, either."
239,00:16:46,00:16:50,"SAE found oral, vaginal and anal smears positive for semen."
240,00:16:50,00:16:54,Degraded and intact sperm suggests multiple deposits.
241,00:16:54,00:16:58,"Which means that he probably raped her on and off, for a long time."
242,00:16:58,00:17:03,"Yeah, well, tox came back-- lorazepam in the vic's blood."
243,00:17:03,00:17:05,I didn't find any prescription bottles in her apartment.
244,00:17:05,00:17:06,"No, nor did I."
245,00:17:06,00:17:11,"Lorazepam is a hypnotic sedative, and I know in high doses, it causes acute amnesia."
246,00:17:11,00:17:14,Maybe that's what he was counting on to cover his tracks.
247,00:17:14,00:17:17,"Well, it usually takes an hour for a drug like that to kick in."
248,00:17:17,00:17:20,How did he subdue her in the meantime?
249,00:17:20,00:17:25,"Low-profile entry, sedatives, duct tape-- I mean, if he's not a serial, he will be soon."
250,00:17:36,00:17:37,"Hey, there, gorgeous."
251,00:17:38,00:17:41,I'm going to be running with the trace from the victim's apartment.
252,00:17:41,00:17:43,Would you mind bringing me up to speed?
253,00:17:43,00:17:44,Certainly.
254,00:17:44,00:17:46,Take your time.
255,00:17:48,00:17:49,PRODUCER: Did you page us?
256,00:17:49,00:17:52,Um... No. Mm-mm.
257,00:17:53,00:18:00,"According to the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer, the glossy red drop you found on the footboard was..."
258,00:18:00,00:18:02,nail polish.
259,00:18:02,00:18:05,"Well, that's not unusual in a woman's apartment."
260,00:18:05,00:18:09,What is far more intriguing is the reflective yellow flakes.
261,00:18:09,00:18:13,Follow me to the Fourier Transform Infrared Microscope.
262,00:18:13,00:18:14,"Hodges, what's wrong with you?"
263,00:18:14,00:18:15,Nothing.
264,00:18:15,00:18:18,PRODUCER (whispering): Guys... stay with the girl.
265,00:18:21,00:18:30,"As you can see, the flakes are fluorescent reflective lenses bonded to an aramid backing by a special polymer layer."
266,00:18:30,00:18:35,And it's used exclusively in the reflective trim of firemen's turnouts.
267,00:18:37,00:18:41,You're telling me there was a firefighter in the victim's bedroom.
268,00:18:43,00:18:45,Hmm...
269,00:18:45,00:18:47,"Thanks. Thanks, Hodges."
270,00:18:47,00:18:49,Anytime.
271,00:18:56,00:18:59,"Yeah, all right, okay, let 'em roll."
272,00:18:59,00:19:00,But you're buying the lobster.
273,00:19:00,00:19:01,"Yeah, right."
274,00:19:01,00:19:06,"See, one of the guys gets on TV, that guy has to buy lobster for the whole company, you know?"
275,00:19:07,00:19:10,These guys eat well-- lobster thermidor!
276,00:19:10,00:19:11,Check it out.
277,00:19:11,00:19:17,"So, according to dispatch, you responded to an alarm at the Omni condos last night?"
278,00:19:17,00:19:18,"Yeah, at 6:58 p.m."
279,00:19:18,00:19:20,We were on scene in about four minutes.
280,00:19:21,00:19:24,"Three smoke bombs on three different floors, three pains in my ass."
281,00:19:24,00:19:26,"There's no major damage, just paint and wallpaper."
282,00:19:26,00:19:27,We were there about a half hour.
283,00:19:27,00:19:29,What'd the arson guys find?
284,00:19:29,00:19:31,They didn't find much.
285,00:19:31,00:19:34,The smoke bombs were made out of soda cans.
286,00:19:34,00:19:36,"Kids, Internet, you do the math."
287,00:19:36,00:19:37,It's all in your lab.
288,00:19:37,00:19:39,Really? What for?
289,00:19:39,00:19:43,A couple guys from the day shift were gonna compare 'em to those bombs we found a couple of weeks ago.
290,00:19:43,00:19:45,What are you talking about?
291,00:19:45,00:19:46,Apartment building over on Paradise.
292,00:19:47,00:19:49,"Smoke bombs started a fire, one woman died."
293,00:19:49,00:19:50,We still don't have a suspect in that.
294,00:19:50,00:19:53,BRASS: Were you on the scene?
295,00:19:53,00:19:55,CAPTAIN: I saw it after.
296,00:19:55,00:19:58,"Smoke bomb was too close to the wall, the whole place..."
297,00:20:04,00:20:07,Which of your guys were up on the 11th floor at the Omni?
298,00:20:07,00:20:09,I don't know. I'd have to ask around. Why?
299,00:20:09,00:20:11,A woman was raped last night.
300,00:20:13,00:20:15,You think one of my guys did it?
301,00:20:15,00:20:19,"I'm not saying that, but we found some evidence that a fireman was near her bed."
302,00:20:19,00:20:22,You came here to accuse my guys of this in front of the camera?
303,00:20:22,00:20:24,"No, no, no. Settle down, settle down..."
304,00:20:24,00:20:25,The hell I will.
305,00:20:28,00:20:30,"No wonder they call you Brass, because you really got a set."
306,00:20:30,00:20:31,"Aw, come on, Sparky..."
307,00:20:32,00:20:33,"SIDLE: Excuse me, gentlemen."
308,00:20:33,00:20:35,"Captain, uh, which of your guys..."
309,00:20:35,00:20:37,wears a yellow reflective stripe on their turnouts?
310,00:20:37,00:20:40,Nobody; department's color is orange.
311,00:20:42,00:20:47,SIDLE: The reflective flake we found in Christina Hollis' apartment was yellow.
312,00:20:47,00:20:50,Then you're not looking for a Las Vegas fireman.
313,00:20:50,00:20:54,"JOHNSON: According to surveillance, the victim came home at 6:19 p.m."
314,00:20:54,00:20:59,And the firemen were in her building at approximately 7:00.
315,00:20:59,00:21:03,"They took the stairs, so we don't have them on this camera."
316,00:21:03,00:21:05,Now take a look at this...
317,00:21:08,00:21:11,"WILLOWS: Well, he certainly looks the part."
318,00:21:11,00:21:14,He touched the door with his bare hands.
319,00:21:14,00:21:16,Might get prints.
320,00:21:18,00:21:21,The time code says 6:36 p.m.
321,00:21:21,00:21:23,but the alarm went out at 6:58.
322,00:21:23,00:21:26,That's 22 minutes later.
323,00:21:26,00:21:28,What kind of fireman comesbeforethe fire?
324,00:21:28,00:21:31,Someone who knows it's coming.
325,00:21:32,00:21:34,"PRODUCER: Uh, Mr. Grissom, we may have missed that."
326,00:21:35,00:21:37,Could you say it one more time for camera?
327,00:21:40,00:21:43,(indistinct conversation)
328,00:21:43,00:21:47,"PRODUCER: You ever hear the saying, ""Only the dumb ones get caught?"" Yeah..."
329,00:21:47,00:21:50,"but we catch the smart ones, too."
330,00:21:50,00:21:52,And this guy's definitely smart.
331,00:21:54,00:21:59,He lights smoke bombs on three different floors so as not to call attention to his target.
332,00:21:59,00:22:05,"Victim sees the smoke, sees him, and opens the door."
333,00:22:11,00:22:13,"(knocking) ! Fire department, open up."
334,00:22:13,00:22:16,"I mean, who wouldn't trust a fireman, right?"
335,00:22:21,00:22:25,CURTIS: It takes a lot of courage to do this.
336,00:22:25,00:22:27,Thank you.
337,00:22:27,00:22:34,"And if you change your mind about the camera, all you have to do is say so-- no one ever has to see this."
338,00:22:34,00:22:37,"No, I wanthimto see it."
339,00:22:37,00:22:40,He'll watch it in jail.
340,00:22:40,00:22:46,"Okay, so, you said you were beginning to remember what happened?"
341,00:22:46,00:22:48,"Yeah, a little."
342,00:22:49,00:22:51,Can you tell me what he looked like?
343,00:22:55,00:22:57,Um...
344,00:22:58,00:23:01,"No, not really."
345,00:23:01,00:23:06,"It's mostly, uh... just feelings."
346,00:23:06,00:23:08,Feelings.
347,00:23:08,00:23:09,Of what?
348,00:23:12,00:23:14,I know he raped me.
349,00:23:20,00:23:24,What I remember most...
350,00:23:24,00:23:26,"it was, um..."
351,00:23:39,00:23:41,(sniffling)
352,00:23:42,00:23:45,He...
353,00:23:45,00:23:47,He kept...
354,00:23:47,00:23:49,He kept touching my feet.
355,00:23:53,00:23:54,(sniffling)
356,00:23:54,00:23:57,He kept touching my feet.
357,00:24:04,00:24:06,(police sirens wailing)
358,00:24:06,00:24:09,A foot fetish is a visual pathology.
359,00:24:09,00:24:14,The suspect would have had to be close enough to the vic to see her toes and then get aroused.
360,00:24:14,00:24:16,"We live in a desert, Gil."
361,00:24:16,00:24:19,"You want to see a woman's bare feet, all you have to do is look down."
362,00:24:26,00:24:29,(footsteps approaching)
363,00:24:29,00:24:34,Door in the parking structure was like the arm of a slot machine: smudge city.
364,00:24:34,00:24:36,Anything useful from the janitor?
365,00:24:36,00:24:37,"Yeah, he gave us a full description."
366,00:24:37,00:24:39,Said he looked like a fireman.
367,00:24:39,00:24:40,(sighs)
368,00:24:40,00:24:47,"Well, between eBay, uniform shops, and national manufacturers, there's about a hundred different places that you can buy yellow-striped turnouts."
369,00:24:47,00:24:50,Maybe he was a fireman in another city.
370,00:24:50,00:24:52,Maybe.
371,00:24:53,00:24:54,What's that?
372,00:24:54,00:25:01,"When I was at the firehouse, all of the air tanks were rigged with the valves on the bottom, like this one."
373,00:25:01,00:25:03,But our guy...
374,00:25:04,00:25:05,his valve is on top.
375,00:25:06,00:25:08,A real fireman probably wouldn't make that mistake.
376,00:25:08,00:25:11,His air line isn't even rigged to his mask.
377,00:25:11,00:25:13,It's rigged to a second mask on his side.
378,00:25:15,00:25:17,Maybe he put something in the tank to subdue her.
379,00:25:17,00:25:20,He used lorazepam.
380,00:25:20,00:25:21,Eventually.
381,00:25:21,00:25:25,But this guy was somehow able to get her from the door to the bed without a struggle.
382,00:25:28,00:25:29,I bet he used nitrous oxide.
383,00:25:31,00:25:32,That stuff will knock you out real fast.
384,00:25:38,00:25:41,And it's undetectable in the blood after a few minutes.
385,00:25:41,00:25:42,Pretty easy to come by.
386,00:25:42,00:25:46,And it would explain the valve on top.
387,00:25:46,00:25:48,It's liquid under pressure.
388,00:25:48,00:25:50,It would spill if it were upside down.
389,00:25:50,00:25:53,All you need is a driver's license and a deposit for the tank.
390,00:25:53,00:25:59,"If this guy bought nitrous from a local distributor, there's definitely a record."
391,00:25:59,00:26:00,Check it out.
392,00:26:00,00:26:02,"Come on, Tina."
393,00:26:02,00:26:04,"Like, I'm the only one working doubles here."
394,00:26:07,00:26:11,"Oh, so it's my fault that we have strange schedules."
395,00:26:13,00:26:15,Great. Go out with your friends.
396,00:26:15,00:26:18,"I'm sure you'll be seeing Robert again tonight, too, huh?"
397,00:26:19,00:26:21,You know what?
398,00:26:21,00:26:22,It's fine.
399,00:26:22,00:26:24,I got to go.
400,00:26:24,00:26:26,Have a fun time.
401,00:26:26,00:26:28,PRODUCER: This a bad time?
402,00:26:28,00:26:32,No. Great time. What can I do for you?
403,00:26:32,00:26:34,What are you working on?
404,00:26:34,00:26:38,"I'm examining smoke bombs recovered from, uh..."
405,00:26:39,00:26:45,"the victim'scondo, and comparing them to smoke bombs from an arson case a couple of weeks ago."
406,00:26:45,00:26:47,How do you know which is which?
407,00:26:47,00:26:49,"I mean, how do you tell them apart?"
408,00:26:49,00:26:54,"Well, so far, I've only opened up one item from each case."
409,00:26:54,00:27:02,"CSIs, when we work a case, we take extensive notes at the scene, and photos of each item."
410,00:27:02,00:27:08,"And, uh... they're very similar, I know."
411,00:27:08,00:27:17,"But, based on the construction and the components, I'd say these two bombs were made by the same person."
412,00:27:24,00:27:27,PRODUCER: So I guess this is a slow day at the morgue.
413,00:27:27,00:27:29,You can't really predict this job.
414,00:27:29,00:27:32,"Today it's like this, tomorrow it's a bus accident."
415,00:27:32,00:27:34,So I am here.
416,00:27:34,00:27:36,Albert. Yeah?
417,00:27:36,00:27:38,Did you find the blood sample I called you about?
418,00:27:38,00:27:41,Female arson fatality. C.O.D. is smoke inhalation.
419,00:27:41,00:27:45,Partial tox came back carboxyhemoglobin and cyanide.
420,00:27:45,00:27:48,I need a test for lorazepam.
421,00:27:48,00:27:50,Blood's on its way to Tox.
422,00:27:50,00:27:55,You recall any other sexual assault victims that tested positive for lorazepam?
423,00:27:55,00:27:59,"Uh... Nothing comes to mind, but I'll check my files, confer with Toxicology."
424,00:27:59,00:28:00,Thanks.
425,00:28:00,00:28:02,Yeah.
426,00:28:02,00:28:05,A slow day is a good day.
427,00:28:05,00:28:10,These people lived on the same floor as the female arson fatality from two weeks ago.
428,00:28:10,00:28:13,Tox on the arson victim came back negative for lorazepam.
429,00:28:14,00:28:16,So maybe she wasn't the target.
430,00:28:16,00:28:18,"PRODUCER: Ms. Sidle, is this what you guys call a ""fishing expedition""?"
431,00:28:19,00:28:20,We call this following a lead.
432,00:28:20,00:28:23,"Forgive me, but it's not very much of a lead."
433,00:28:23,00:28:25,What's that supposed to mean?
434,00:28:25,00:28:27,"Well, this case is even colder than the oneyou'reon."
435,00:28:27,00:28:31,You'd almost be better off if you had a new rape victim and a fresh scene.
436,00:28:31,00:28:37,"That might be true, but that is definitely not the outcome that we're looking for."
437,00:28:46,00:28:48,WOMAN: I didn't really know the girl who died.
438,00:28:48,00:28:50,I still can't believe what happened.
439,00:28:50,00:28:52,It's just awful.
440,00:28:52,00:28:53,Tell me what you remember.
441,00:28:55,00:28:57,I was alone in my apartment Saturday night.
442,00:28:57,00:29:00,"Hello. What's new, right?"
443,00:29:00,00:29:01,I was reading or something.
444,00:29:01,00:29:05,"And then, suddenly, there was someone pounding on my door."
445,00:29:13,00:29:15,Can you describe what he looked like?
446,00:29:15,00:29:17,"Well, he was fireman."
447,00:29:17,00:29:19,"I mean, he was wearing a mask."
448,00:29:19,00:29:22,It all happened pretty quick.
449,00:29:22,00:29:25,Why?
450,00:29:25,00:29:29,We're looking for a rapist who masquerades as a fireman.
451,00:29:30,00:29:35,He uses smoke bombs to get his victims to open their doors.
452,00:29:36,00:29:38,He knocked on my door.
453,00:29:38,00:29:42,Are you saying you think he was going to rape me?
454,00:29:42,00:29:43,It's possible.
455,00:29:43,00:29:48,"You know, I was pretty freaked."
456,00:29:49,00:29:52,When he was standing there in front of me...
457,00:29:56,00:30:04,"Just before he left, I swear, for a second, it felt like he wasn't going to let me go."
458,00:30:09,00:30:11,Turnouts were a dead end.
459,00:30:11,00:30:14,And there's nothing to track off of the smoke bombs.
460,00:30:14,00:30:18,I've got hundreds of names of people who purchased nitrous oxide in the last six months.
461,00:30:18,00:30:20,What? You got to narrow that down.
462,00:30:20,00:30:22,That is narrowed down.
463,00:30:24,00:30:26,Okay. Our rapist is a foot fetishist.
464,00:30:26,00:30:27,That's what gets him off.
465,00:30:27,00:30:30,He has to see his victim's feet somewhere.
466,00:30:30,00:30:34,"If we can figure out where, maybe we can find him."
467,00:30:34,00:30:36,What do the victims have in common?
468,00:30:38,00:30:40,Christina Hollis.
469,00:30:40,00:30:42,African American. Single.
470,00:30:42,00:30:44,Lives and works at the Omni.
471,00:30:44,00:30:49,"She lives on the 11th floor, so there's no real way for a peeper to see in."
472,00:30:49,00:30:53,"And she uses the gym, but not the pool."
473,00:30:53,00:30:57,Stephanie Daniels lives across town. Caucasian. Also single.
474,00:30:57,00:31:01,"No gym membership, but she does use the pool at her apartment complex regularly."
475,00:31:01,00:31:04,There's a couple of adjacent buildings.
476,00:31:04,00:31:08,"It's possible that somebody could see into her place with a telescope, but she has shades and curtains."
477,00:31:09,00:31:11,I kind of doubt it.
478,00:31:11,00:31:13,So they have nothing in common.
479,00:31:13,00:31:16,"Sure, they do. They both have feet."
480,00:31:16,00:31:21,We may have a third victim who may also be our first victim.
481,00:31:21,00:31:28,"Tara Weathers. Last month, she claimed she was drugged in a bar and woke up in her apartment with her toes freshly painted."
482,00:31:28,00:31:31,They did a tox on her at the time.
483,00:31:31,00:31:33,Found lorazepam in her system.
484,00:31:36,00:31:38,"Well, she does have nice feet."
485,00:31:39,00:31:43,And the nail polish looks like a similar shade to Christina Hollis'.
486,00:31:43,00:31:45,Yeah. So the pattern starts a month ago.
487,00:31:45,00:31:51,"Our guy drugs Tara Weathers in a bar, takes her to her apartment, paints her toes, leaves."
488,00:31:51,00:31:54,"Two weeks later, he steps it up."
489,00:31:54,00:32:00,"Poses as a firefighter, places smoke bombs in an apartment building, only things don't work out the way that he planned."
490,00:32:00,00:32:03,"The building catches fire, and he runs."
491,00:32:03,00:32:08,"He waits a couple more weeks, he does it again, but this time he goes all the way."
492,00:32:08,00:32:09,Yeah. And now he's escalating.
493,00:32:09,00:32:12,Where does he go from here?
494,00:32:17,00:32:18,Tara Weathers?
495,00:32:18,00:32:20,"I'm Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police."
496,00:32:20,00:32:22,This is Catherine Willows from the Crime Lab.
497,00:32:22,00:32:23,What do you want?
498,00:32:23,00:32:27,"Well, we're here to ask you about the incident you reported to the police last month."
499,00:32:27,00:32:28,The nail polish thing?
500,00:32:28,00:32:29,"Yeah, the nail polish thing."
501,00:32:29,00:32:33,"You guys said I should consider myself lucky, that there was no real crime anyway."
502,00:32:33,00:32:35,"Well, we may have been wrong about that."
503,00:32:35,00:32:38,"I knew it, that's what I tried to tell you the first time."
504,00:32:41,00:32:47,"BRASS: The guy who drugged you is a rapist and a murderer, and we're looking to stop him before he does it again."
505,00:32:47,00:32:48,Are you serious?
506,00:32:48,00:32:49,Very.
507,00:32:49,00:32:53,We're trying to understand what you have in common with the other victims that might lead us to him.
508,00:32:53,00:32:55,Now he has a foot fetish.
509,00:32:55,00:32:56,He's into feet.
510,00:32:56,00:33:00,Is there any way that he could've... seen your feet?
511,00:33:00,00:33:01,Um...
512,00:33:01,00:33:04,I-I... I don't know.
513,00:33:04,00:33:05,Where do you buy your shoes?
514,00:33:05,00:33:07,All over.
515,00:33:07,00:33:09,"Do you go to a gym? No, not really."
516,00:33:09,00:33:10,Pool?
517,00:33:10,00:33:12,"No, never. I burn easily."
518,00:33:12,00:33:14,"I'm a legal secretary, I don't get out much."
519,00:33:14,00:33:18,My work starts early and it goes late.
520,00:33:18,00:33:21,"The firm is so conservative, we're not even allowed to wear open-toed shoes."
521,00:33:21,00:33:23,I notice that you do yoga.
522,00:33:23,00:33:24,Yeah.
523,00:33:25,00:33:26,Where?
524,00:33:26,00:33:27,Out on the balcony.
525,00:33:27,00:33:29,It's practically the only fresh air I get.
526,00:33:43,00:33:47,Anybody in those apartments has a clear view of her bare feet.
527,00:33:47,00:33:50,PRODUCER: So how'd you get the warrant?
528,00:33:50,00:33:53,The tenant's name was on the nitrous oxide list.
529,00:33:54,00:33:55,Las Vegas Police.
530,00:33:55,00:33:57,"Open up, we have a warrant."
531,00:33:57,00:33:59,"Open up, police."
532,00:33:59,00:34:01,Open it.
533,00:34:03,00:34:05,Let's go.
534,00:34:05,00:34:07,"No, no, no, you're not going in there, no."
535,00:34:07,00:34:09,"Can you please take this in, it's a flashlight cam."
536,00:34:09,00:34:11,It'll record anything you point it at.
537,00:34:13,00:34:14,All clear.
538,00:34:15,00:34:16,Thanks.
539,00:34:32,00:34:34,Perfect view of Tara's balcony.
540,00:34:43,00:34:47,Yoga flyers from all over town.
541,00:34:51,00:34:54,Guy's got everything he needs for a pedicure.
542,00:35:08,00:35:11,"Hey, check this out."
543,00:35:12,00:35:15,God bless the internet.
544,00:36:00,00:36:03,Fireman's air tank case.
545,00:36:07,00:36:09,Where's the tank?
546,00:36:16,00:36:18,(cell phone blips)
547,00:36:18,00:36:20,"Yeah, this is Brass."
548,00:36:20,00:36:22,I want to put a broadcast out on Richard McQueen.
549,00:36:22,00:36:25,That's M-C-Q-U-E-E-N.
550,00:36:25,00:36:27,Copy. (cell phone blips)
551,00:36:27,00:36:28,Candle wax on the camera.
552,00:37:02,00:37:04,"There, send it to the monitor."
553,00:37:11,00:37:13,(siren)
554,00:37:13,00:37:15,(garbled radio transmission)
555,00:37:15,00:37:18,(sirens)
556,00:37:22,00:37:24,(grunting): Stay down!
557,00:37:24,00:37:26,Las Vegas P.D.!
558,00:37:26,00:37:28,"Las Vegas P.D., break it up!"
559,00:37:28,00:37:29,Break it up!
560,00:37:29,00:37:31,What the hell's going on here? Smoke bombs.
561,00:37:31,00:37:32,We caught this creep sneaking away.
562,00:37:32,00:37:35,My guys tried to stop him.
563,00:37:35,00:37:37,She wouldn't let me touch her feet.
564,00:37:37,00:37:39,You should see what he did?
565,00:37:49,00:37:50,(sighs)
566,00:38:15,00:38:19,Women are four times more likely than men to be the victims of a sex-related murder.
567,00:38:19,00:38:23,And men are ten times more likely than women to be the murderer.
568,00:38:23,00:38:25,It's just the way it is.
569,00:38:44,00:38:46,Is that your daughter?
570,00:38:46,00:38:49,"Oh, yeah, these are old pictures."
571,00:38:49,00:38:51,She's a teenager now.
572,00:38:51,00:38:54,"With all the things you see on this job, do you ever worry about her?"
573,00:38:54,00:38:56,Are you kidding?
574,00:38:56,00:38:58,I keep a vial of her blood in my freezer.
575,00:38:58,00:39:04,Like as a DNA sample in case you need to identify her?
576,00:39:04,00:39:07,Well...
577,00:39:07,00:39:14,One thing you learn doing this job is that bad things happen to people who never expect it...
578,00:39:14,00:39:16,every day.
579,00:39:26,00:39:28,"Yeah, we got a confession."
580,00:39:28,00:39:31,"He didn't choose women's feet, women's feet chose him."
581,00:39:31,00:39:35,"He lit candles, he played music, he thought he was on a date."
582,00:39:35,00:39:37,"But did he explain, you know, why he did it?"
583,00:39:37,00:39:39,"Oh, yeah. Oh, sure."
584,00:39:39,00:39:46,"His mother was a hooker, she put him under the bed when she did her business, her feet dangled over the edge of the bed."
585,00:39:46,00:39:48,"He watched her feet, they were perfect."
586,00:39:48,00:39:50,"You know, I don't know if it's true."
587,00:39:50,00:39:53,What about the fireman thing?
588,00:39:53,00:39:56,"I don't know, I guess he wanted to be a fireman when he grew up."
589,00:39:56,00:39:59,Didn't you?
590,00:39:59,00:40:01,"Look, juries love explanations, they want it nice and neat."
591,00:40:01,00:40:06,"They don't want to know we live in a random world, they want meaning."
592,00:40:06,00:40:08,It's that simple.
593,00:40:08,00:40:10,So how do you cope with a day like today?
594,00:40:10,00:40:12,What do you do?
595,00:40:12,00:40:21,"What do you want me to tell you, that I go home, I get drunk, I go to a bar, I stay out all night, I don't sleep... huh?"
596,00:40:21,00:40:22,That's not the truth. You know what happens?
597,00:40:23,00:40:25,"I take care of myself, I sleep very well."
598,00:40:25,00:40:30,How well did you sleep after you learned you killed that fellow officer in that shootout last year?
599,00:40:36,00:40:38,"Uh, yeah."
600,00:40:38,00:40:39,"Oh, is this... is that..."
601,00:40:39,00:40:40,"Oh, is this what this is about?"
602,00:40:40,00:40:42,"Who've you been talking to, huh?"
603,00:40:42,00:40:45,"What, you come here with your camera and you roll a little film and..."
604,00:40:45,00:40:48,"what, you think you know what it's like to be a cop?"
605,00:40:48,00:40:50,You?
606,00:40:51,00:40:53,You're all done. You're all done with this.
607,00:40:53,00:40:55,Get out of here.
608,00:40:58,00:41:02,"The truth is if there isn't any evidence, we have nowhere to go."
609,00:41:02,00:41:04,So you feel you did the best you could?
610,00:41:04,00:41:05,"Yes, I do."
611,00:41:06,00:41:10,Do you think forensic shows are just teaching the criminals how to get away with crimes?
612,00:41:10,00:41:13,Everyone learns from science.
613,00:41:13,00:41:16,It all depends on how you use the knowledge.
614,00:41:19,00:41:21,(camera beeps)
615,00:41:21,00:41:23,"Keep going, go inside for a close-up."
