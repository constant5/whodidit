0	00:00:21	00:00:23	Great party, Drops.
1	00:01:11	00:01:12	Shark!
2	00:01:12	00:01:13	Shark!
3	00:01:13	00:01:15	Shark! Shark! Shark! Shark!
4	00:01:15	00:01:16	No, guys, there's a shark!
5	00:01:16	00:01:17	There's a shark in the water!
6	00:01:26	00:01:27	Drops, don't...
7	00:01:40	00:01:43	You guys beat the Coast Guard here.
8	00:01:43	00:01:45	This is my first shark call out.
9	00:01:45	00:01:47	You? What do you think?
10	00:01:47	00:01:48	The victim's name is Desiree McQuire.
11	00:01:48	00:01:52	She's 28. She's a cocktail waitress here at the Golden Nugget.
12	00:01:52	00:01:53	Today was her day off.
13	00:02:09	00:02:10	Little jumpy, David?
14	00:02:10	00:02:14	Booby-trapped bodies, a shark in a swimming pool.
15	00:02:14	00:02:16	I'm a little jumpy, yeah.
16	00:02:16	00:02:20	How we gonna get it out of there, so we can get her out of there?
17	00:02:20	00:02:21	I think I can answer that.
18	00:02:21	00:02:24	You see Jacques Cousteau over there?
19	00:02:24	00:02:26	He's the aquatic veterinarian.
20	00:02:26	00:02:30	Okay, well, maybe he can share with us how a shark got into this pool.
21	00:02:30	00:02:32	Excuse me!
22	00:02:32	00:02:33	Dr. Holloway.
23	00:02:33	00:02:35	Catherine Willows. Nice to meet you.
24	00:02:35	00:02:36	You, too.
25	00:02:36	00:02:39	How soon can we get the shark out of here?
26	00:02:39	00:02:40	I need to get my victim out of the pool.
27	00:02:40	00:02:42	Well, just give us a few minutes to pull it out.
28	00:02:42	00:02:46	Saltwater tiger shark in a freshwater pool is a lethal combination.
29	00:02:46	00:02:49	Shark population worldwide is in decline without crazy stuff like this.
30	00:02:49	00:02:51	All right, guys, let's go.
31	00:02:51	00:02:52	Let's see if we can save her.
32	00:02:52	00:02:55	I don't know what to tell you.
33	00:02:55	00:02:59	Shark got tired of entertaining the guests and busted out of the tank.
34	00:02:59	00:03:03	Well, Conrad, it's 120 degrees out here and we're pulling a young dead woman out of the pool.
35	00:03:03	00:03:06	That's it, that's all I got for you right now.
36	00:03:06	00:03:07	Hey, sorry, I'm late. I had an appointment.
37	00:03:07	00:03:09	I heard it over the squawk. What's going on?
38	00:03:09	00:03:10	You kidding me?!
39	00:03:10	00:03:13	I got enough problems in the casino.
40	00:03:13	00:03:15	Now I got people going out in body bags?
41	00:03:15	00:03:17	Besides me, who's in charge here?
42	00:03:17	00:03:18	CSI Willows.
43	00:03:18	00:03:19	This is Nick Stokes.
44	00:03:19	00:03:20	Willows?
45	00:03:22	00:03:23	You're Sam's little girl, right?
46	00:03:23	00:03:28	No, I'm a big girl, telling you to step behind the tape before I have you arrested.
47	00:03:28	00:03:30	Just like your old man.
48	00:03:30	00:03:32	Always got his way, one way or the other.
49	00:03:32	00:03:34	You should discuss this someplace else.
50	00:03:34	00:03:36	I got it, Nicky.
51	00:03:36	00:03:39	Mr. Boozell, we're here to investigate.
52	00:03:39	00:03:41	This is an active crime scene.
53	00:03:41	00:03:45	I wouldn't even let the sheriff past that tape, so consider this conversation a luxury.
54	00:03:45	00:03:48	Let us do our job, and then you can go back doing yours.
55	00:03:48	00:03:53	Sam's little girl.
56	00:03:57	00:04:01	So that's Earnest Boozell, huh?
57	00:04:01	00:04:02	The Booze?
58	00:04:02	00:04:05	Biggest shark in Vegas.
59	00:04:40	00:04:42	So, all sharks arrive from back of house.
60	00:04:42	00:04:47	Most from Eastern waters, off the Keys, Montauk, Costa Rica.
61	00:04:47	00:04:50	They arrive via truck, in water tanks.
62	00:04:50	00:04:53	They're humanely transported.
63	00:04:53	00:04:56	I put them in the aquarium, help them survive the shock.
64	00:04:56	00:04:59	Now they're in show business.
65	00:04:59	00:05:01	Well, I guess that's one way to make a living.
66	00:05:01	00:05:03	How many tiger sharks do you have in your tank currently?
67	00:05:03	00:05:06	Well, we try to keep it to three or four.
68	00:05:06	00:05:08	Any more than that and they start to turn on each other.
69	00:05:08	00:05:12	Let's put it this way, it's a very challenging little ecosystem.
70	00:05:12	00:05:14	All right, well, I'm gonna ask the obvious.
71	00:05:14	00:05:17	Is there a tiger shark that's missing from this tank?
72	00:05:17	00:05:21	Well, Mr. Boozell wants you to know that, no, all tiger sharks are accounted for.
73	00:05:21	00:05:29	He also wants you to know that this aquarium right here is built with eight inches of Plexiglas and uses a completely different plumbing system than the pool.
74	00:05:29	00:05:35	He also wants you to know that if you don't take his word for it, you can just suit up and see for yourself.
75	00:05:35	00:05:38	I do count four tiger sharks in the tank.
76	00:05:38	00:05:40	Just like it says in the manifest there. Four.
77	00:05:40	00:05:43	Thank you, Dr. Holloway.
78	00:05:43	00:05:45	Hey, CSIs, tick-tock.
79	00:05:45	00:05:46	Your time is my money.
80	00:05:46	00:05:48	Still here?
81	00:05:48	00:05:50	How's my day club? Up and running yet?
82	00:05:51	00:05:56	If you want me to break down the financials for you, I'll be glad to do it.
83	00:05:56	00:05:57	I'll do it, anyway.
84	00:05:57	00:06:01	My night club makes three to five million on a sold-out weekend.
85	00:06:01	00:06:05	The day club, H2O, does seven to ten million.
86	00:06:05	00:06:08	Not to mention the 20 mil that they drop inside.
87	00:06:08	00:06:11	one minute you're flush, the next you're bust.
88	00:06:11	00:06:13	Spoken just like a true mogul's daughter.
89	00:06:13	00:06:15	What made you become a cop?
90	00:06:15	00:06:18	I happen to love my job, and could you please leave my father out of this?
91	00:06:18	00:06:21	Well, I love my job, too, and I got to get back to it.
92	00:06:21	00:06:23	The manifests don't lie.
93	00:06:23	00:06:27	It's clear that the shark in the pool did not come from my tank.
94	00:06:27	00:06:28	Well, it had to come from somewhere.
95	00:06:28	00:06:31	Well, maybe it checked in last night, VIP.
96	00:06:31	00:06:34	No, VIS-- Very Important Shark.
97	00:06:34	00:06:39	He checked in, took a dip in the pool this morning, had a bite to eat.
98	00:06:39	00:06:41	Now he's on the hook for murder.
99	00:06:41	00:06:42	All right, you're right, sir.
100	00:06:42	00:06:44	Your manifest did check out, but we're far from done.
101	00:06:44	00:06:47	Now we need access to your surveillance.
102	00:06:47	00:06:48	All of it.
103	00:06:49	00:06:50	Thank you.
104	00:06:50	00:06:51	Thank you!
105	00:06:53	00:06:55	Wait, no, no, no, no.
106	00:06:55	00:06:58	Pool's closed, ladies.
107	00:06:58	00:07:00	Let's just go across the street to Macklin's.
108	00:07:00	00:07:01	We're losing sun.
109	00:07:04	00:07:06	Last of the lookiloos?
110	00:07:06	00:07:07	Yeah, yeah.
111	00:07:07	00:07:10	Now it sounds like everybody's going to the pool across the street.
112	00:07:10	00:07:11	Well, I just came from the Eye in the Sky.
113	00:07:11	00:07:15	I had security run the outdoor cameras leading up to the time of the attack.
114	00:07:15	00:07:17	There are no signs of anyone dropping a shark into the pool.
115	00:07:17	00:07:21	But the cameras inside the casino are a lot better than out here.
116	00:07:21	00:07:24	Half of this pool is covered in a blind spot.
117	00:07:24	00:07:26	Yeah, well, maybe somebody knew that, you know?
118	00:07:26	00:07:27	Maybe it's an inside job.
119	00:07:29	00:07:31	This is pretty easy access.
120	00:07:31	00:07:35	Back door leading from the house right to the... pool.
121	00:07:45	00:07:48	I got to say, it's a great place to get high.
122	00:07:48	00:07:50	Yeah, not a bad place to smuggle in a shark, either.
123	00:08:08	00:08:09	Hey, there.
124	00:08:09	00:08:10	Hey.
125	00:08:10	00:08:11	Welcome back.
126	00:08:11	00:08:13	So how was Spokane?
127	00:08:13	00:08:15	It was your niece, wasn't it?
128	00:08:15	00:08:16	It was Portland.
129	00:08:16	00:08:18	It was my sister.
130	00:08:18	00:08:20	And it was good.
131	00:08:23	00:08:25	Oh, Catherine.
132	00:08:25	00:08:28	I swear to God, all she does is buzz me all day.
133	00:08:32	00:08:35	I wanted to pick up where we left off.
134	00:08:35	00:08:37	Okay.
135	00:08:37	00:08:38	Dinner?
136	00:08:38	00:08:41	I can't, I'm really busy.
137	00:08:41	00:08:44	But can we definitely talk later?
138	00:08:44	00:08:46	Sure, yeah, sure. (phone vibrates)
139	00:08:46	00:08:48	Oh, Catherine again.
140	00:08:49	00:08:54	Uh, I got to go, but we'll talk later?
141	00:08:54	00:08:55	Mm-hmm.
142	00:08:55	00:08:58	Okay.
143	00:08:58	00:09:01	Hey, Catherine, hello.
144	00:09:01	00:09:03	Hey, yeah...
145	00:09:10	00:09:12	I thought I heard you coming.
146	00:09:13	00:09:15	Back on the rails.
147	00:09:15	00:09:18	(chuckles) Steady, thanks to you.
148	00:09:18	00:09:20	Permission to come aboard.
149	00:09:20	00:09:23	Permission granted, Captain.
150	00:09:23	00:09:24	This our girl?
151	00:09:24	00:09:27	Desiree McQuire, 28.
152	00:09:27	00:09:28	Arm's missing.
153	00:09:28	00:09:34	Got a hunch where it went, but that is the Aquatic Vet's purview, not mine.
154	00:09:34	00:09:35	C.O.D. exsanguination?
155	00:09:35	00:09:36	Seems obvious.
156	00:09:38	00:09:40	Well, a shark tooth.
157	00:09:40	00:09:43	Not a drop of blood on it.
158	00:09:45	00:09:47	Clean as a whistle.
159	00:09:47	00:09:49	No blood on the puncture.
160	00:09:49	00:09:56	Tells me the tissue lacks vital response, which means there was no blood flowing through the tissue when she was bitten.
161	00:09:56	00:09:58	According to David's report, she bled out in the pool.
162	00:09:58	00:10:01	Well, then, blood had to be flowing.
163	00:10:01	00:10:04	How can both things be true?
164	00:10:04	00:10:06	Been a while, Drops.
165	00:10:06	00:10:12	That's your ganja, man. And that's enough to put you right back in a ten-by-eight cell.
166	00:10:12	00:10:13	Let me guess.
167	00:10:13	00:10:16	One of your fancy machines fingered me?
168	00:10:16	00:10:18	Yeah, so, uh, what now?
169	00:10:18	00:10:20	You guys going to charge me with smoking?
170	00:10:20	00:10:21	I like murder better.
171	00:10:21	00:10:23	Murder? Yeah.
172	00:10:23	00:10:25	Nick, help me out here.
173	00:10:25	00:10:27	Hey, don't look at me, man.
174	00:10:27	00:10:29	I'm not the one that got you in this mess.
175	00:10:29	00:10:38	That blunt puts you in the one blind spot where a shark could have been put into the water, and according to Human Resources, you had access to the service area, which is right next to the pool.
176	00:10:38	00:10:40	A young woman was killed.
177	00:10:40	00:10:42	That makes you a co-conspirator.
178	00:10:42	00:10:43	To a shark?
179	00:10:43	00:10:45	Yeah.
180	00:10:45	00:10:48	Man, you Columbos got this all wrong.
181	00:10:48	00:10:50	I promote Boozell's day clubs.
182	00:10:50	00:10:56	That's why I have all access, and the area behind the pool is where we bring in the DJ equipment.
183	00:10:56	00:11:02	Do you guys have any idea how hard it is to get a job when you get out the pen?
184	00:11:02	00:11:07	Boozell took a chance on me after I was laid off from my first gig.
185	00:11:07	00:11:08	Why would I blow that?
186	00:11:08	00:11:10	The job or the blunt?
187	00:11:10	00:11:13	Come on, now, got a wife and kid to support.
188	00:11:13	00:11:15	And it's not like Macklin's going to take me back.
189	00:11:15	00:11:18	You used to work across the street at Macklin's?
190	00:11:18	00:11:19	I used to promote his day clubs.
191	00:11:19	00:11:22	I mean, until I got fired for nothing.
192	00:11:22	00:11:29	Okay, Macklin's got an aquarium, sharks and a day club that would benefit from Boozell's bad luck. Wait a minute.
193	00:11:29	00:11:35	So you think that I put that shark in that pool for a guy who fired me?
194	00:11:35	00:11:39	No, but you and I both know that if the price is right, you'd look the other way.
195	00:11:39	00:11:42	I mean, you do have a wife and a kid to support. You said it.
196	00:11:42	00:11:47	And if there's one guy who just can't stay out of jail...
197	00:11:47	00:11:48	it's you.
198	00:11:50	00:11:54	Why would this Drops kid bite the hand that feeds him?
199	00:11:54	00:11:56	I gave him a job right after Macklin threw him out.
200	00:11:56	00:11:59	And my day club went through the roof.
201	00:11:59	00:12:02	I'm not one for puns, but it sounds like you're fishing.
202	00:12:02	00:12:09	Maybe I am testing the waters a bit, trying to get a little background.
203	00:12:09	00:12:11	Let's be cards up on this.
204	00:12:11	00:12:13	Your daddy used to say that.
205	00:12:13	00:12:18	The rivalry between you and Macklin-- to insiders like me, is a bedtime story.
206	00:12:18	00:12:27	I know all about Macklin's signature property, the Big Dragon going off, rattling the windows of your casino, and you barging into his office, demanding that he turn it down.
207	00:12:27	00:12:29	And what did he do? He made it even louder.
208	00:12:29	00:12:37	So, when Macklin built his topless Euro pool, you put up a tower that blocked all of his customers' sun.
209	00:12:37	00:12:39	What's the problem?
210	00:12:39	00:12:46	You both have day clubs, pools, sharks, and a rivalry that goes back to when Bugsy set foot in the desert.
211	00:12:46	00:12:48	You don't think I put the shark in my own pool?
212	00:12:48	00:12:50	That doesn't make sense.
213	00:12:50	00:12:51	You know the financials.
214	00:12:51	00:12:54	They just w-walk across the street.
215	00:12:56	00:12:58	Macklin.
216	00:12:58	00:13:00	I'm gonna kill him.
217	00:13:00	00:13:02	Bit of free advice.
218	00:13:02	00:13:04	Never say that in front of a cop.
219	00:13:06	00:13:09	Shark bites a woman's arm off, severs the brachial artery.
220	00:13:09	00:13:10	What happens?
221	00:13:10	00:13:12	She's going to bleed out into the pool, period.
222	00:13:12	00:13:19	Which leads us back to the tooth, which shows no evidence of inflammation or any hemorrhaging in the surrounding soft tissue where you found it.
223	00:13:19	00:13:23	Which could only mean she was dead before the shark ever took a bite.
224	00:13:23	00:13:28	All right, so if she was dead before she was bitten, a shark bites a dead woman's arm off, severs an artery. What happens?
225	00:13:28	00:13:30	She's going to bleed out into the pool.
226	00:13:30	00:13:33	Why? Because the artery's like a pipe; the blood's got to go somewhere.
227	00:13:33	00:13:36	Okay, okay, both things are true.
228	00:13:36	00:13:39	Our victim did not die of a shark attack.
229	00:13:39	00:13:44	We are still looking for C.O.D.
230	00:13:44	00:13:46	Any other signs of trauma on the body?
231	00:13:46	00:13:48	Not on the front.
232	00:13:48	00:13:50	I guess we're gonna have to flip her.
233	00:13:50	00:13:53	All righty.
234	00:14:00	00:14:02	All right.
235	00:14:12	00:14:14	Oh, injection mark.
236	00:14:14	00:14:16	Looks like a large-gauge needle.
237	00:14:16	00:14:19	It would be impossible to inject yourself in the middle of your back like this.
238	00:14:21	00:14:24	What color was the raft?
239	00:14:24	00:14:26	Catherine said coral.
240	00:14:26	00:14:28	Coral it is.
241	00:14:34	00:14:39	According toSharkWeek, it only takes a drop of blood to attract a shark from a hundred miles away.
242	00:14:39	00:14:43	Which would explain why Desiree was singled out by the shark.
243	00:14:46	00:14:49	That means the shark is only guilty of biting a dead woman.
244	00:14:49	00:14:51	Our killer's still out there.
245	00:14:58	00:15:00	Dr. Ray, it's good to have you back.
246	00:15:00	00:15:01	Good to be back, Henry.
247	00:15:01	00:15:03	Got C.O.D. on your shark victim.
248	00:15:03	00:15:04	You were right.
249	00:15:04	00:15:06	Acute opiate toxicity.
250	00:15:06	00:15:07	It was a heroin overdose.
251	00:15:07	00:15:10	Based on metabolites, she was a first-time user.
252	00:15:10	00:15:12	So her first dose was also her last. Mm-hmm.
253	00:15:12	00:15:18	Well, there's obviously a ton of people in the pool, and all the angles are terrible.
254	00:15:18	00:15:25	I do have some shots of Desiree, but from the time she got on the raft until she was attacked, there's no clear shots of Desiree or her killer.
255	00:15:25	00:15:28	She's wearing an awful lot of bling to be hanging by the pool.
256	00:15:28	00:15:29	Yeah, right?
257	00:15:34	00:15:36	Yeah, hang on a second.
258	00:15:40	00:15:46	She rolls into the pool looking like Paris Hilton, but when she comes out, she's lost her life and all her jewelry.
259	00:15:46	00:15:51	Her arm was devoured by a shark, which means she was thrashed about a bit.
260	00:15:51	00:15:54	So maybe the rest of her jewelry is at the bottom of the pool.
261	00:15:55	00:15:58	You and Wendy talk?
262	00:15:58	00:16:01	Yeah, we talk all the time.
263	00:16:01	00:16:02	Why?
264	00:16:02	00:16:05	You talk to Wendy?
265	00:16:05	00:16:08	It's more like she talks to me.
266	00:16:08	00:16:10	It's not that serious.
267	00:16:10	00:16:12	She comes to me, we talk.
268	00:16:12	00:16:14	You know, friends.
269	00:16:14	00:16:15	W-Wait.
270	00:16:15	00:16:17	W-What kind of friends?
271	00:16:17	00:16:19	Friend friends or friends with benefits?
272	00:16:19	00:16:21	Well, define benefits.
273	00:16:24	00:16:26	Um...
274	00:16:26	00:16:29	I'll load up and meet you out front.
275	00:16:37	00:16:39	Is this the talk later part?
276	00:16:41	00:16:42	Yeah.
277	00:16:42	00:16:44	Is it about Henry?
278	00:16:48	00:16:49	No.
279	00:16:51	00:16:53	Is it about me?
280	00:16:55	00:16:56	It's about you and me.
281	00:17:01	00:17:04	I got a new job.
282	00:17:07	00:17:09	That's great.
283	00:17:09	00:17:12	What, they gonna send you out in the field, or...?
284	00:17:12	00:17:14	It's in Portland with my sister.
285	00:17:14	00:17:18	Not in Spokane with my niece.
286	00:17:18	00:17:20	And I get to be a field mouse.
287	00:17:22	00:17:24	Not a lab rat.
288	00:17:24	00:17:26	Wow.
289	00:17:27	00:17:29	Congratulations.
290	00:17:29	00:17:32	Thank you.
291	00:17:32	00:17:35	Does anybody else know about this?
292	00:17:35	00:17:37	Um, yeah.
293	00:17:37	00:17:41	Yeah, Catherine was nice enough to make a couple phone calls for me.
294	00:17:41	00:17:47	And, um, Henry-- he gave me some advice.
295	00:17:47	00:17:50	I'm leaving, Hodges.
296	00:17:51	00:17:53	Yeah.
297	00:17:53	00:17:56	And I'm the last to know.
298	00:17:56	00:17:57	Yeah, you're the last to know.
299	00:17:57	00:18:00	Because I wanted it that way.
300	00:18:00	00:18:08	Because I knew that if I told you sooner, you would get really upset, and then you'd blame Henry, and you'd try to get me to stay.
301	00:18:08	00:18:11	And I can't.
302	00:18:15	00:18:16	Wendy...
303	00:18:27	00:18:28	Good-bye.
304	00:18:28	00:18:31	D-Don't.
305	00:18:40	00:18:47	Mr. Macklin, Mr. Danny Macklin, please pick up the nearest white courtesy phone.
306	00:18:47	00:18:50	This is Macklin.
307	00:18:50	00:18:53	I see.
308	00:18:53	00:18:55	Strawberry blond, all business.
309	00:18:55	00:18:58	I think I found her.
310	00:18:58	00:18:59	Still paging?
311	00:18:59	00:19:01	Now, that's old school.
312	00:19:01	00:19:04	I consider myself new school, but paging is vintage Vegas.
313	00:19:04	00:19:05	Danny Macklin.
314	00:19:05	00:19:08	Catherine Willows, CSI.
315	00:19:08	00:19:10	Please.
316	00:19:10	00:19:13	CSI, huh?
317	00:19:13	00:19:14	Let me guess.
318	00:19:14	00:19:18	The Booze couldn't keep the sharks in his tank, and now he's blaming me.
319	00:19:18	00:19:24	Well, as you know, Mr. Macklin, day clubs are the hottest ticket in town, unless of course, you have a shark-infested pool.
320	00:19:24	00:19:27	And I know that you have a stable of sharks.
321	00:19:27	00:19:29	Would you like to count my sharks?
322	00:19:29	00:19:33	Because I can tell you that if there's a shark missing, I'd be the first to know.
323	00:19:33	00:19:34	Yes, but would you tell me?
324	00:19:34	00:19:40	You know, I wouldn't put it past the Booze to drop a shark in his own pool and try to finger me for it.
325	00:19:40	00:19:43	Not exactly the smartest ace in the deck.
326	00:19:43	00:19:44	More of a joker, actually.
327	00:19:44	00:19:49	Well, joke's on him, because his dollars are walking right through my front door.
328	00:19:49	00:19:51	Which makes you the prime suspect.
329	00:19:51	00:19:54	That's enough business.
330	00:19:54	00:19:57	Why don't, um, why don't we get some lunch, huh?
331	00:19:57	00:19:58	We got a great shark fin soup here.
332	00:19:58	00:20:00	Can I order you some?
333	00:20:00	00:20:03	That's one of the biggest reasons sharks are becoming extinct.
334	00:20:04	00:20:06	I'll pass.
335	00:20:06	00:20:09	Thanks for your time, Mr. Macklin.
336	00:20:12	00:20:13	How long did you know?
337	00:20:13	00:20:15	Know what?
338	00:20:15	00:20:18	Wendy was leaving.
339	00:20:18	00:20:22	She asked my opinion a couple months ago; I told her it was a great opportunity.
340	00:20:22	00:20:24	So, basically, you pushed her out the door.
341	00:20:24	00:20:27	You going to Portland, too, Mr. Friends With Benefits?
342	00:20:27	00:20:30	Look, Hodges, as much as you think it's a one-way street, it wasn't, all right?
343	00:20:30	00:20:34	I can't help that she comes to me 'cause she can't talk to you.
344	00:20:34	00:20:35	Henry, you might want to shut up now.
345	00:20:35	00:20:37	Seriously, you're gonna blame me?
346	00:20:37	00:20:39	Dude, you're the one that couldn't close.
347	00:20:39	00:20:41	Henry. No, you took her out for coffee, right?
348	00:20:41	00:20:44	And then you can't take her home, 'cause you live at home.
349	00:20:44	00:20:46	What are you going to tell your Mom, take a ride around the block?
350	00:20:46	00:20:48	That's it!
351	00:20:50	00:20:52	This is all your fault! What are you doing?
352	00:20:58	00:21:00	Henry?
353	00:21:00	00:21:02	Henry?
354	00:21:04	00:21:05	Henry!
355	00:21:08	00:21:09	I found the murder weapon.
356	00:21:12	00:21:13	Good eyes.
357	00:22:03	00:22:05	Run this through tox.
358	00:22:05	00:22:09	I want to make sure it's the same needle that injected heroin into our victim.
359	00:22:09	00:22:11	Okay. As long as you keep Hodges away from me.
360	00:22:11	00:22:13	I think I got swimmer's ear.
361	00:22:13	00:22:15	Hmm?
362	00:22:15	00:22:17	From... Forget it.
363	00:22:28	00:22:30	Hey, Jim, it's Nick.
364	00:22:30	00:22:34	We need to pick up a woman-- Anya Sanchez, FHA.
365	00:22:34	00:22:38	27321 Barlow.
366	00:22:38	00:22:39	She's got quite a rap sheet.
367	00:22:39	00:22:41	I think this may be our girl.
368	00:22:43	00:22:44	Come on. That's Cartier.
369	00:22:44	00:22:46	No, no, no, no.
370	00:22:46	00:22:47	That's robbery.
371	00:22:47	00:22:50	And this is your second strike, right?
372	00:22:50	00:22:52	I mean, that's... that's quite a pile.
373	00:22:52	00:22:54	Looks like there's a few strikes in there.
374	00:22:54	00:22:56	Then again, all we need is three, right?
375	00:22:56	00:22:57	Come on, you guys.
376	00:22:57	00:22:59	Come on.
377	00:22:59	00:23:01	I know this game, all right?
378	00:23:01	00:23:03	You bring me in here.
379	00:23:03	00:23:04	You lean on me.
380	00:23:04	00:23:06	You try to get me to plea.
381	00:23:06	00:23:08	You like that?
382	00:23:08	00:23:10	You got a Patek Philippe? I don't know.
383	00:23:10	00:23:11	Check.
384	00:23:11	00:23:13	You want to keep that?
385	00:23:13	00:23:15	Sure.
386	00:23:15	00:23:18	How about you take a bracelet for your little girlfriend?
387	00:23:18	00:23:19	I got a girlfriend, too.
388	00:23:19	00:23:21	Be my guest.
389	00:23:21	00:23:23	Okay.
390	00:23:23	00:23:25	It's not that easy.
391	00:23:25	00:23:27	It could be, really.
392	00:23:27	00:23:30	I don't think you realize how much trouble you're in.
393	00:23:30	00:23:31	Do you recognize...
394	00:23:31	00:23:32	this girl?
395	00:23:32	00:23:35	Her name's Desiree McQuire.
396	00:23:35	00:23:37	I mean, you should.
397	00:23:37	00:23:38	You're in possession of her necklace, her rings...
398	00:23:38	00:23:40	and I think these are her bracelets.
399	00:23:40	00:23:43	And I'm going to go out on a limb here and...
400	00:23:43	00:23:46	those gold hoop earrings-- those are hers, too.
401	00:23:48	00:23:50	Okay.
402	00:23:51	00:23:54	Okay.
403	00:23:54	00:23:56	Yeah, yeah, I've been a bad girl.
404	00:23:57	00:24:01	I admit I got sticky fingers sometimes, so...
405	00:24:01	00:24:04	print me, book me, whatever it is.
406	00:24:04	00:24:08	I'm just going to post bail and take a few days off work, so...
407	00:24:08	00:24:10	You'll need more than a couple days.
408	00:24:10	00:24:12	I know how you robbed her.
409	00:24:13	00:24:15	You injected her with heroin.
410	00:24:15	00:24:18	When she was knocked out, you picked her clean.
411	00:24:18	00:24:21	The tough spot is, your fingerprint was on the syringe.
412	00:24:21	00:24:23	And let me guess.
413	00:24:23	00:24:25	That was a new batch of heroin, right?
414	00:24:25	00:24:27	Well, you know...
415	00:24:27	00:24:31	the weekend cleaned me out, so I had to improvise.
416	00:24:31	00:24:37	So I got it from a new seller, but I didn't sell it, so... it's just robbery.
417	00:24:41	00:24:43	Right?
418	00:24:43	00:24:49	No. No, unfortunately, Miss McQuire died-- of a heroin overdose.
419	00:24:49	00:24:51	It's felony murder.
420	00:24:51	00:24:55	You gave her a hot shot, hotshot.
421	00:24:55	00:24:58	You're right.
422	00:24:58	00:25:00	You've been a bad girl.
423	00:25:05	00:25:07	Brass ran Anya Sanchez's credit cards.
424	00:25:07	00:25:10	She's been renting out cabanas at every pool party in town.
425	00:25:10	00:25:16	She had quite an attitude till she realized she'd gone from thief to murderer, but I don't think she had anything to do with our shark attack.
426	00:25:16	00:25:17	Two separate events.
427	00:25:17	00:25:18	Yeah, sounds like it.
428	00:25:18	00:25:22	So we're still chasing the idiot who put the shark in the water.
429	00:25:22	00:25:25	Which is attempted murder on everyone in Boozell's pool.
430	00:25:25	00:25:28	All right, based on her condition, I'd say she's a young one.
431	00:25:28	00:25:30	No more than five or six.
432	00:25:30	00:25:36	Under normal circumstances, not exposed to the pool's filtration system, she could have lived another 30 years.
433	00:25:36	00:25:37	Doctor, care to do the honors?
434	00:25:37	00:25:39	Why not?
435	00:25:49	00:25:51	Dr. Langston.
436	00:25:51	00:25:52	Thank you.
437	00:25:59	00:26:01	That's... that's better.
438	00:26:01	00:26:04	See if you can get those spreaders in there.
439	00:26:09	00:26:11	Okay.
440	00:26:11	00:26:12	That is one huge gut.
441	00:26:12	00:26:14	She is an eating machine.
442	00:26:23	00:26:24	All right.
443	00:26:24	00:26:26	You mind if I take a look?
444	00:26:26	00:26:27	Be my guest.
445	00:26:27	00:26:29	All right, let's see what we got.
446	00:26:29	00:26:32	Now, this shark is definitely from the wild.
447	00:26:32	00:26:35	You can tell by the species she was eating.
448	00:26:35	00:26:38	You got mackerel... (grunts)
449	00:26:38	00:26:39	Here we go. Excuse me.
450	00:26:39	00:26:41	And some eel.
451	00:26:42	00:26:44	A little squid.
452	00:26:45	00:26:48	Ah. Got, uh, even some baby shark.
453	00:26:48	00:26:51	Zebra, blacktip.
454	00:26:51	00:26:53	Found off the Florida Keys.
455	00:26:53	00:26:56	What I cannot tell you is how she got here.
456	00:26:56	00:27:00	There are collectors who capture sharks out of the ocean.
457	00:27:00	00:27:02	They're legit if they have permits.
458	00:27:02	00:27:05	But the sharks are almost impossible to track.
459	00:27:05	00:27:07	Well, thank you, Dr. Holloway.
460	00:27:07	00:27:08	You've been very helpful.
461	00:27:08	00:27:10	Gentlemen.
462	00:27:13	00:27:15	Helpful? (door closes)
463	00:27:15	00:27:17	He's not a SharkWeekwatcher.
464	00:27:17	00:27:20	Most aquariums get their sharks from captive breeding programs.
465	00:27:20	00:27:22	Right.
466	00:27:25	00:27:26	Hmm.
467	00:27:27	00:27:30	Where does a wild shark get freshly-cut pieces of fish?
468	00:27:30	00:27:32	The doctor's a liar.
469	00:27:32	00:27:36	You know, I've taken the tour at Mandalay Bay.
470	00:27:36	00:27:38	You know, the one with the audio guide to your ear.
471	00:27:38	00:27:40	I hate those things. I love them.
472	00:27:40	00:27:43	You learn stuff. Sharks in captivity have to be tagged.
473	00:27:43	00:27:51	It's like bringing a DB into autopsy without a toe tag. I am telling you-- this shark was shark-napped out of some casino.
474	00:27:51	00:27:54	I believe you, Doc.
475	00:28:01	00:28:03	You ever known shark skin to be smooth?
476	00:28:03	00:28:05	Feel that-- right there.
477	00:28:05	00:28:06	Hmm.
478	00:28:06	00:28:09	It's almost as if it was sanded down.
479	00:28:09	00:28:13	Well, if you can do it with the VIN number of a car, why not a shark?
480	00:28:37	00:28:43	Genus cuvier.
481	00:28:43	00:28:45	Galeocerdo cuvier--GC.
482	00:28:45	00:28:47	So the first two letters of the I.D.
483	00:28:47	00:28:49	are genus and species.
484	00:28:49	00:28:53	Right. The next two numbers denote the year that the shark was purchased.
485	00:28:53	00:28:55	One zero means 2010.
486	00:28:55	00:29:01	And zero three means it was the third tiger shark purchased for that particular aquarium.
487	00:29:01	00:29:06	And there are only a handful of aquariums in Vegas that have sharks.
488	00:29:06	00:29:09	I've got the list right here.
489	00:29:09	00:29:13	And I think I know who I'm going to talk to first.
490	00:29:13	00:29:19	LANGSTON Well, Mr. Macklin, that is your shark.
491	00:29:19	00:29:25	At least, it was your shark until it took a dip in Mr. Boozell's pool.
492	00:29:25	00:29:29	And, Mr. Macklin, let me remind you of your own words.
493	00:29:29	00:29:34	If there's a shark missing from my property, I'd be the first to know.
494	00:29:36	00:29:37	Here's the thing.
495	00:29:37	00:29:42	As of, uh, yesterday, I'm not missing a shark.
496	00:29:42	00:29:45	But, last week, I had a shark with a tapeworm.
497	00:29:45	00:29:46	Excuse me?
498	00:29:46	00:29:51	Yeah, I got a $50,000 shark that's eating me out of house and home, eating all my baby sharks.
499	00:29:51	00:29:54	(stammers) Do you know how much it costs to ship a zebra or blacktip to Vegas?
500	00:29:54	00:29:55	How much?
501	00:29:55	00:29:58	15 grand a fish. Yeah.
502	00:29:58	00:30:01	And this tiger shark is eating them up like potato chips.
503	00:30:01	00:30:07	See, my goal on my property is to provide a tranquil aquarium for my guests as they check in.
504	00:30:07	00:30:14	And instead, I've got a 200-pound eating machine that's tearing up my tank before my guests can even get their freaking key cards.
505	00:30:14	00:30:17	So I, uh, checked the shark out early.
506	00:30:17	00:30:18	I got rid of it.
507	00:30:18	00:30:22	How did you get rid of it? I called my guy-- the guy who takes care of my fish. Um... Aquavet.
508	00:30:22	00:30:24	Dr. Holloway.
509	00:30:24	00:30:25	He handles all the properties.
510	00:30:25	00:30:26	He came by, picked it up.
511	00:30:26	00:30:37	Oh, and, uh, speaking of my words, it went a little something like this-- You get that disposal with a fin off my property, before I turn it into a buffet special.
512	00:30:37	00:30:40	I got something to say! You think I don't know cops with cell phones? You gotta be kidding me!
513	00:30:40	00:30:43	Who do you think dimed you out to let me know you're here?
514	00:30:43	00:30:45	I'm on to you, Macklin. Yeah, I want a piece of you. You feelin' tough?!
515	00:30:45	00:30:46	You want a piece of me? Okay...
516	00:30:46	00:30:48	You want too far this time with that shark. You just keep talking.
517	00:30:48	00:30:50	You crossed the line. It's all going on record. You keep talking.
518	00:30:50	00:30:51	Gentlemen! (shouting stops)
519	00:30:51	00:30:52	This interview's over.
520	00:30:52	00:30:54	Escort them out of here.
521	00:30:54	00:30:57	Come on, let's go.
522	00:31:05	00:31:07	Talk about shark-infested waters.
523	00:31:25	00:31:28	Bring it back when you take the boot off.
524	00:31:32	00:31:33	Send a stretch.
525	00:31:35	00:31:37	Yeah, Catherine, we got a bead on Dr. Holloway.
526	00:31:37	00:31:43	His office said he's working at Macklin's property, but we can't seem to get him on the phone, so he must be in the water.
527	00:31:43	00:31:46	We'll call you as soon as we find out something else.
528	00:31:46	00:31:47	There you are.
529	00:31:47	00:31:49	Mom, Mom, I got it.
530	00:31:49	00:31:50	It's so cool.
531	00:31:50	00:31:52	I got a great picture! Come on!
532	00:31:52	00:31:55	Awfully fired up about taking a picture of a fish.
533	00:31:55	00:31:58	Well, you know, fish are beautiful.
534	00:31:58	00:32:00	Not when you're sleeping with them.
535	00:32:00	00:32:02	It's Dr. Holloway.
536	00:32:02	00:32:05	Well, that explains why his cell phone went straight to voice mail.
537	00:32:18	00:32:20	First blush?
538	00:32:20	00:32:22	Pink.
539	00:32:22	00:32:23	What caused it?
540	00:32:23	00:32:29	Could be carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, cyanide.
541	00:32:29	00:32:31	Dealer's choice, pal.
542	00:32:46	00:32:48	Hey. Where do you want this?
543	00:32:48	00:32:52	Why don't you put it in my mouth and shoot it with a high-powered rifle?
544	00:32:52	00:32:53	No way, man.
545	00:32:53	00:32:55	Last thing I need's another explosion.
546	00:32:55	00:32:57	I'm just starting to get my hearing back.
547	00:32:57	00:32:58	I got to buck up.
548	00:32:58	00:33:01	I got to get my shark face on.
549	00:33:01	00:33:03	Get tough.
550	00:33:03	00:33:05	Good. You know, I have a tough job for a tough guy.
551	00:33:05	00:33:06	Excellent.
552	00:33:06	00:33:08	I need to keep my mind off Wendy.
553	00:33:08	00:33:11	Okay, test the contents of the tank with quants, please.
554	00:33:11	00:33:14	Want to give me a heads up, let me know what I'm looking for?
555	00:33:14	00:33:16	Whatever turned our suspect into the Pink Panther.
556	00:33:16	00:33:18	Mmm.
557	00:33:18	00:33:20	Hey. Hey.
558	00:34:02	00:34:05	it's CO poisoning; carbon monoxide.
559	00:34:05	00:34:08	Someone tampered with Holloway's scuba tank.
560	00:34:08	00:34:09	I can tell you how.
561	00:34:09	00:34:11	Also found hydrocarbons and nitrous oxides.
562	00:34:11	00:34:14	Both are by-products of an internal combustion engine.
563	00:34:14	00:34:18	You're saying somebody filled his scuba tank with car exhaust?
564	00:34:18	00:34:20	Well, it's not that hard really.
565	00:34:20	00:34:23	You just take the compressor intake, put it next to the exhaust, and you're in business.
566	00:34:23	00:34:26	Even one percent of carbon monoxide can kill you.
567	00:34:26	00:34:32	It binds 200 times tighter to hemoglobin than oxygen, preventing the O2 from being distributed and absorbed by the body.
568	00:34:32	00:34:34	And you suffocate.
569	00:34:34	00:34:35	Yeah, and you turn pink.
570	00:34:35	00:34:40	We know that it was Macklin's shark that ended up in Boozell's pool.
571	00:34:40	00:34:44	Probably put there by Dr. Holloway, who worked for both Macklin and Boozell.
572	00:34:44	00:34:50	So, who stood to gain more by the doctor's untimely death, the Booze or the Mack?
573	00:34:50	00:34:52	Let's run both scenarios. I'm the Mack.
574	00:34:52	00:34:56	I call up the Aquavet and I say, Hey, man, you wanna make a little extra cash?
575	00:34:56	00:35:02	Sand the number off the reject shark from my tank, throw it in Boozell's pool so I that I can steal all his customers.
576	00:35:02	00:35:03	Only don't tell the cops.
577	00:35:03	00:35:04	Oops.
578	00:35:04	00:35:13	Or I'm the Booze, and I call the Aquavet and I say, Hey, I know Macklin paid you to put that shark into my pool to ruin me.
579	00:35:13	00:35:15	You're a dead man.
580	00:35:15	00:35:16	Who's got better motive?
581	00:35:16	00:35:17	We let the evidence decide.
582	00:35:17	00:35:20	Ask the gentlemen to start their engines.
583	00:35:20	00:35:22	I think I can narrow that down a bit.
584	00:35:24	00:35:29	Based on the ratio of contaminants found in the exhaust, we're looking for an older car.
585	00:35:29	00:35:32	Pre-'70s... vintage.
586	00:35:33	00:35:35	Okay, Joe. (engine starts)
587	00:35:35	00:35:39	Everyone in Vegas knows that you have a collection of classic cars.
588	00:35:39	00:35:43	You parade them up and down the Strip every year.
589	00:35:43	00:35:46	Your '64 Aston Martin is pre-catalytic converter.
590	00:35:46	00:35:49	Puts out plenty of carbon monoxide.
591	00:35:49	00:35:55	The ratios of hydrocarbons and nitrous oxides matches the ratios that we found in Dr. Holloway's scuba tank.
592	00:35:55	00:35:58	Willows, I flunked science.
593	00:35:58	00:36:02	Are you trying to say that my car killed Holloway?
594	00:36:02	00:36:05	Why would it do that?
595	00:36:05	00:36:07	Because you knew that Macklin gave back a shark.
596	00:36:07	00:36:09	the Aquavet.
597	00:36:09	00:36:13	And you figured that Macklin and the Aquavet were in cahoots, so you had him whacked.
598	00:36:13	00:36:16	You want to talk old school, that's dinosaur times.
599	00:36:16	00:36:21	I'd rather not state the obvious, but my hotel is hot.
600	00:36:21	00:36:23	Crawling with cops.
601	00:36:23	00:36:26	I can't walk through my casino without bumping into you and that other one.
602	00:36:26	00:36:27	You got the wrong guy.
603	00:36:27	00:36:31	Well, then how did the exhaust from your vehicle end up in Dr. Holloway's tank?
604	00:36:31	00:36:34	What am I, one of those Mythbustersguys?
605	00:36:35	00:36:37	I don't know.
606	00:36:37	00:36:42	Look, when I was younger, the tit for tat was better than sex.
607	00:36:42	00:36:44	But these days it just gives me indigestion.
608	00:36:44	00:36:49	So when Macklin invited me to dinner last night, I accepted.
609	00:36:49	00:36:54	And when he said, Let's bury the hatchet, I said, Consider it squashed.
610	00:36:54	00:36:56	We broke bread.
611	00:36:56	00:36:58	His joint-- Carne's.
612	00:36:58	00:37:00	That used to mean something.
613	00:37:00	00:37:02	Well, it doesn't mean that you're off the hook.
614	00:37:02	00:37:08	Willows, I'm telling you-- cards up-- all I can give you is my word.
615	00:37:08	00:37:09	That used to mean something, too.
616	00:37:33	00:37:36	Sorry to hear about your friend.
617	00:37:36	00:37:39	Good news is she came to you, and now it's squashed.
618	00:37:39	00:37:42	But remember one thing, Mugs...
619	00:37:42	00:37:46	just because you say it's squashed, doesn't mean it's squashed.
620	00:37:49	00:37:51	Remember that, Catherine.
621	00:38:15	00:38:17	Evening, ladies.
622	00:38:17	00:38:18	Oh, this is my spot.
623	00:38:18	00:38:20	But don't go anywhere. I'll need you.
624	00:38:20	00:38:22	Hey, maybe I should call Mr. Macklin.
625	00:38:22	00:38:24	Uh, on second thought, follow me.
626	00:38:24	00:38:26	Any surveillance on property?
627	00:38:26	00:38:28	Only inside.
628	00:38:28	00:38:30	And every car you valet ends up where?
629	00:38:30	00:38:32	In the lot.
630	00:38:32	00:38:34	And what about the boss's cars, or the boss's friends' cars?
631	00:38:34	00:38:37	We keep 'em right here. Easy access. No waiting.
632	00:38:37	00:38:39	Can I go now, ladies?
633	00:38:39	00:38:40	You were right, Catherine.
634	00:38:40	00:38:43	I think I got something here.
635	00:38:49	00:38:51	Hmm.
636	00:38:51	00:38:52	Uh, what is this?
637	00:38:52	00:38:55	I don't know. I just park cars.
638	00:38:55	00:38:57	Smells like exhaust.
639	00:38:57	00:39:00	Are you sure that you didn't see somebody using this last night?
640	00:39:00	00:39:02	No.
641	00:39:04	00:39:08	Oh, Sara, I think we've got ourselves an eyewitness.
642	00:39:08	00:39:11	Yeah.
643	00:39:11	00:39:14	You know the thing about ATM machines?
644	00:39:14	00:39:17	They take pictures every 15 seconds.
645	00:39:17	00:39:21	And you know what they say about tiger sharks?
646	00:39:21	00:39:24	They can't close their mouths.
647	00:39:24	00:39:25	Really?
648	00:39:25	00:39:26	Neither can valet parkers.
649	00:39:26	00:39:30	And this one gave you up faster than a natural blackjack.
650	00:39:30	00:39:32	No comment.
651	00:39:32	00:39:34	No comment.
652	00:39:34	00:39:35	That's beautiful.
653	00:39:35	00:39:38	Beautiful.
654	00:39:38	00:39:39	Let me tell you a story.
655	00:39:39	00:39:41	How about you spare me and not tell me a story?
656	00:39:41	00:39:46	Once upon a time, there was this two-bit mogul who made a cheap play for a shark.
657	00:39:46	00:39:50	He had buyer's remorse, so he thought he'd pawn it off on his veterinarian.
658	00:39:50	00:39:52	But then he had a better idea.
659	00:39:52	00:39:54	He thought, Maybe I'll make some money.
660	00:39:54	00:39:55	After all, it is Vegas.
661	00:39:55	00:40:00	Maybe I'll make the money back that I spent on the shark and stick it to my enemy at the same time.
662	00:40:00	00:40:02	Earnest Boozell.
663	00:40:02	00:40:05	So in order to make this scam work, he needs the help of the veterinarian.
664	00:40:05	00:40:10	The veterinarian has the key to Boozell's property and a means to dump it.
665	00:40:10	00:40:11	How am I doing so far, Catherine?
666	00:40:11	00:40:13	Give him a couple more bites.
667	00:40:13	00:40:16	The Aquavet, he's the victim.
668	00:40:16	00:40:17	He's not very bright.
669	00:40:17	00:40:30	He was trying to remove the VIN number from the fin-- the fin number-- 'cause he thought that way, we couldn't trace Because if there was a missing shark on your property, you'd be the first to know, right?
670	00:40:30	00:40:36	I don't know what kind of financial arrangement you had with the veterinarian, but something happened, and he had to go.
671	00:40:36	00:40:39	But you thought you'd cover your tracks, so you tampered with his scuba gear.
672	00:40:39	00:40:42	And you thought you'd lay that off on Boozell, as well.
673	00:40:42	00:40:46	Why'd you do that? I thought it was squashed?
674	00:40:46	00:40:49	So now our story comes to an end.
675	00:40:49	00:40:52	You're going down for murder...
676	00:40:52	00:40:55	hook, line and sinker.
677	00:41:05	00:41:08	Now you know the little secret.
678	00:41:08	00:41:13	Everyone thinks that this is for the guests, but it's really for me.
679	00:41:13	00:41:15	Spoken like a free man.
680	00:41:15	00:41:18	I was wrong about you.
681	00:41:18	00:41:22	I thought you were just like your old man.
682	00:41:22	00:41:23	How's that?
683	00:41:23	00:41:26	Passionate, hardworking, driven by money?
684	00:41:26	00:41:28	Two out of the three.
685	00:41:28	00:41:29	Which two?
686	00:41:29	00:41:33	Passionate, hardworking.
687	00:41:33	00:41:36	The truth is, I'm driven by the money, too, just like your father.
688	00:41:36	00:41:38	But you're not.
689	00:41:38	00:41:40	You're different than us.
690	00:41:40	00:41:44	Now I can see where the greatness comes from.
691	00:41:44	00:41:47	Thank you... for the compliment.
692	00:41:49	00:41:52	Squashed?
