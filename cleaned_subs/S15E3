0	00:00:03	00:00:05	It will come to pass!
1	00:00:05	00:00:07	It's just a matter of time.
2	00:00:07	00:00:09	You can only lie to yourselves for so long.
3	00:00:09	00:00:11	We pretend that we're not afraid.
4	00:00:11	00:00:15	But when it happens and that day comes...
5	00:00:15	00:00:19	nothing will stop the world from bleeding.
6	00:00:20	00:00:21	Nothing!
7	00:00:28	00:00:31	I spoke with responding officers.
8	00:00:31	00:00:35	Landlord came by here to pick up the rent, saw him and turned right around.
9	00:00:35	00:00:37	Tenant's name is Jack Smith.
10	00:00:37	00:00:38	He lived alone.
11	00:00:38	00:00:41	Sounds like a throwaway name.
12	00:00:42	00:00:45	paid all cash, no I.D. on file.
13	00:00:45	00:00:47	Lifestyles of the broke and anonymous.
14	00:00:47	00:00:49	This place is covered in blood.
15	00:00:50	00:00:52	There's blood on the floor.
16	00:00:52	00:00:54	There's more on the wall.
17	00:00:55	00:00:57	It's all over the place.
18	00:01:02	00:01:05	Blood void. Got a spent shell over here.
19	00:01:05	00:01:06	Nine-mil casing.
20	00:01:07	00:01:08	GSW to his neck.
21	00:01:08	00:01:11	Looks like he bled out pretty quickly.
22	00:01:11	00:01:14	Yeah? Then how did blood get all over the room?
23	00:01:14	00:01:16	Expirated blood on the wall here.
24	00:01:18	00:01:20	Possible fight before the kill shot?
25	00:01:20	00:01:24	Well, if we're lucky, maybe some of this blood belongs to his assailant.
26	00:01:30	00:01:36	This whole bookshelf is about world-ending plagues, biological disasters...
27	00:01:42	00:01:44	The wall is just plastered with paranoia.
28	00:01:45	00:01:47	Uh... Greg?
29	00:01:47	00:01:48	Yeah?
30	00:01:48	00:01:50	This man was sick.
31	00:01:50	00:01:51	What do you mean?
32	00:01:51	00:01:53	I mean, don't touch anything.
33	00:01:53	00:01:55	I'm, uh, uh... I'm gonna call the CDC.
34	00:01:55	00:01:57	His eye.
35	00:01:57	00:01:59	Have you ever seen anything like that before?
36	00:01:59	00:02:01	Yeah, in biology textbooks.
37	00:02:02	00:02:04	Viral epidemics.
38	00:02:04	00:02:05	Exactly.
39	00:02:06	00:02:09	The pathogen could be in all this blood.
40	00:02:11	00:02:12	It could be airborne.
41	00:02:12	00:02:13	Try not to panic.
42	00:02:13	00:02:15	I'm just trying not to breathe.
43	00:02:15	00:02:18	This is CSI Sara Sidle from the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
44	00:02:18	00:02:22	I'm at a crime scene with what appears to be a possible hemorrhagic fever.
45	00:02:22	00:02:24	One decedent.
46	00:02:27	00:02:29	Two others may have been exposed.
47	00:03:16	00:03:17	Let's go! Get the windows sealed!
48	00:03:17	00:03:19	Secure the perimeter!
49	00:03:19	00:03:22	No entry without Level Four coverage.
50	00:03:22	00:03:23	Keep it moving!
51	00:03:23	00:03:24	Clock is ticking!
52	00:03:27	00:03:28	Hey.
53	00:03:28	00:03:30	Russell. I'm so sorry.
54	00:03:30	00:03:31	I should've been the first one in there.
55	00:03:31	00:03:33	I-I got stuck at that suicide over on...
56	00:03:33	00:03:36	Relax. You were just doing your job. Coroner's office?
57	00:03:36	00:03:40	Yeah. He'll get you suited up for entry to remove the infected decedent. Of course.
58	00:03:40	00:03:42	Supervisor Russell?
59	00:03:42	00:03:45	Yes. Dr. Emmett, CDC Emergency Response Specialist.
60	00:03:45	00:03:47	Any idea what we're dealing with here?
61	00:03:47	00:03:49	Undetermined, but the symptoms suggest a virus.
62	00:03:49	00:03:51	We're treating the house as a hot zone.
63	00:03:51	00:03:52	Extracting the potentially exposed subjects.
64	00:03:52	00:03:54	Those subjects are my CSIs.
65	00:03:54	00:03:56	I just spoke to them on the phone.
66	00:03:56	00:03:58	They're a little concerned about what's happening next.
67	00:03:58	00:04:01	They'll be suited up and transported to hospital quarantine.
68	00:04:01	00:04:03	They mention having removed anything from inside the house?
69	00:04:03	00:04:04	No. No, no, no.
70	00:04:04	00:04:08	All their gear, their collected evidence, is still inside. Good. It'll stay there.
71	00:04:08	00:04:09	Once the subjects are out, we'll nuke the place.
72	00:04:09	00:04:10	Wait, wait, I'm sorry.
73	00:04:10	00:04:11	What do you mean, nuke?
74	00:04:11	00:04:15	Blast it with UV light and formaldehyde fog, killing any living organism in there.
75	00:04:15	00:04:17	There's our artillery now.
76	00:04:17	00:04:19	Well... wait a sec.
77	00:04:19	00:04:22	The dead man in there was-was killed by a gunshot.
78	00:04:22	00:04:24	I heard. Not his day at the tables.
79	00:04:24	00:04:29	What I'm saying is there was at least one other person-- the shooter-- inside that room.
80	00:04:29	00:04:30	And he might be infected.
81	00:04:30	00:04:35	So frying all the biologicals in there might stop us from tracking the guy down.
82	00:04:35	00:04:36	A valid point.
83	00:04:36	00:04:38	But no match for the holy gospel of protocol.
84	00:04:38	00:04:39	I'll keep you updated.
85	00:04:55	00:04:56	You okay in there?
86	00:04:56	00:04:59	We had to leave the evidence behind.
87	00:04:59	00:05:01	Scene's getting completely stepped on in there.
88	00:05:01	00:05:03	We uploaded our photos to the cloud.
89	00:05:03	00:05:05	It might be all we can salvage.
90	00:05:05	00:05:06	I'm not concerned about that right now.
91	00:05:06	00:05:08	Folks, we need to keep moving!
92	00:06:19	00:06:23	If they've been infected, we may not know for days.
93	00:06:23	00:06:30	Viral incubation period could be up to two weeks, you know, so they'll be tested, observed, and... I don't know, we just wait, I guess.
94	00:06:30	00:06:32	This is rough, D.B.
95	00:06:32	00:06:33	State's sending resources.
96	00:06:33	00:06:34	Area hospitals are on alert.
97	00:06:34	00:06:37	I mean, soon the story's gonna hit the news, and then everything gets cranked up.
98	00:06:37	00:06:40	I've got Morgan and Nick going over the crime scene photos.
99	00:06:40	00:06:43	On top of all this, we have a... a murder to solve.
100	00:06:43	00:06:46	Yeah, right. Gunshot in the throat almost feels quaint, doesn't it?
101	00:06:46	00:06:47	Supervisor Russell? Yes.
102	00:06:47	00:06:49	Dr. Heather Lanning, from RyneLab Biomedical.
103	00:06:49	00:06:52	My counterpart at the CDC informed you I'd be here?
104	00:06:52	00:06:54	Yeah. This is... Sheriff Ecklie. Hi.
105	00:06:54	00:06:55	Hi.
106	00:06:55	00:06:57	I understand the situation's overwhelming.
107	00:06:57	00:06:58	I'm here to help.
108	00:06:58	00:07:01	RyneLab is a private research facility right here in Nevada.
109	00:07:01	00:07:05	The only Biosafety Level Four site in the region, equipped to handle the deadliest organisms.
110	00:07:05	00:07:08	CDC brought us in to assist on this case.
111	00:07:08	00:07:11	So your lab's gonna tell us what kind of bug we're dealing with here, right?
112	00:07:11	00:07:14	Because two of my team may have been infected.
113	00:07:14	00:07:15	I understand.
114	00:07:15	00:07:18	If I can start with a look at the damage inflicted...
115	00:07:18	00:07:20	Okay, I got this. Why don't you check in with your team? Right.
116	00:07:20	00:07:22	Right this way, please. Okay.
117	00:07:30	00:07:31	Surgical scissors would be safer.
118	00:07:31	00:07:36	You risk puncturing your suit with that blade and infecting yourself.
119	00:07:38	00:07:40	This is Dr. Lanning from RyneLab.
120	00:07:40	00:07:41	Helping with the case.
121	00:07:41	00:07:46	I appreciate your concern, but believe me, I've never cut more carefully in my life.
122	00:07:46	00:07:49	So what do we have, Doc?
123	00:07:49	00:07:51	Well, starting with the gunshot wound, it's a through-and-through.
124	00:07:51	00:07:53	There's no sooting or stippling.
125	00:07:53	00:07:55	The entry wound is irregular.
126	00:07:55	00:07:57	It suggests a ricochet before impact.
127	00:08:01	00:08:07	I found no I.D. or possessions in his pockets, and there was no print match through Mobile AFIS.
128	00:08:07	00:08:09	So we're still not even sure of his name.
129	00:08:09	00:08:11	A true Patient Zero.
130	00:08:11	00:08:13	No way to build a profile...
131	00:08:13	00:08:15	who or what he may have had contact with.
132	00:08:29	00:08:35	The lungs are soft, hemorrhagic, and the spleen is mushy.
133	00:08:35	00:08:37	Consistent with a filovirus infection.
134	00:08:39	00:08:41	Like Marburg or Ebola.
135	00:08:45	00:08:47	No. No, I disagree, Jules.
136	00:08:47	00:08:48	I don't think you should fly back.
137	00:08:48	00:08:53	I mean, if this thing turns into a real outbreak, I think you're better off in Seattle.
138	00:08:53	00:08:56	Well, how long till we have an update on Sara and Greg?
139	00:08:56	00:08:59	They're still being tested, so they couldn't take any calls.
140	00:08:59	00:09:01	I wish there was something I could do to help.
141	00:09:01	00:09:02	I know.
142	00:09:02	00:09:06	You could tell me you've found something on our Gig Harbor twins.
143	00:09:06	00:09:10	I am still trying to put together Winthrop and Briscoe's backgrounds.
144	00:09:10	00:09:14	You know, both men have lived without leaving much of a trail.
145	00:09:14	00:09:21	But I'm going through hospital records right now, and searching for identical twins born to unwed Seattle mothers.
146	00:09:21	00:09:24	Ages that would obviously be right for them.
147	00:09:24	00:09:25	You know, I just need a birth date.
148	00:09:25	00:09:27	It would really help me with foster searches.
149	00:09:27	00:09:31	All right. Well, it's a start. Enough to keep fishing, don't you think? Mm-hmm.
150	00:09:31	00:09:33	Will you call me if you hear anything?
151	00:09:33	00:09:34	Of course I will.
152	00:09:40	00:09:41	Hey.
153	00:09:41	00:09:43	So I talked to the CDC rep.
154	00:09:43	00:09:46	I told him that we need to be in that house as soon as possible.
155	00:09:46	00:09:49	I know all that DNA evidence is gonna be destroyed.
156	00:09:49	00:09:52	All we have right now are the photos that they uploaded.
157	00:09:52	00:09:55	Overalls, uh, shots of blood spatter.
158	00:09:55	00:09:57	I don't know what we're going to get from these.
159	00:09:57	00:10:01	Just like any other case, we need to find out who this victim is first.
160	00:10:01	00:10:05	Maybe some small detail will tell us where he's been, who he's been hanging out with...
161	00:10:05	00:10:06	Who else might have been infected.
162	00:10:06	00:10:07	Yeah, exactly.
163	00:10:07	00:10:12	So I'm just scanning these, looking for an I.D. badge, a piece of mail... Yeah.
164	00:10:12	00:10:13	Wait. What about that book?
165	00:10:13	00:10:15	Seconds to Apocalypse.
166	00:10:15	00:10:17	Yeah, it's got a library tag on the spine.
167	00:10:17	00:10:20	That might just work. He might have a-an account at the library.
168	00:10:20	00:10:22	It could help us with the I.D. Yeah.
169	00:10:22	00:10:23	It's worth a shot. (phone chiming)
170	00:10:23	00:10:25	Yeah, there's Russell.
171	00:10:25	00:10:26	He's in Layout.
172	00:10:26	00:10:27	He's got some news. Let's go.
173	00:10:27	00:10:28	Yeah.
174	00:10:30	00:10:31	Sara.
175	00:10:31	00:10:32	Greg.
176	00:10:32	00:10:36	I'm here to tell you that RyneLab has identified the pathogen.
177	00:10:37	00:10:39	It's called the Ibare virus.
178	00:10:39	00:10:43	A blood-borne filovirus, not unlike Ebola in viral structure.
179	00:10:43	00:10:50	It replicates at a staggering rate, decimating the host's cells and causing massive hemorrhage.
180	00:10:50	00:10:51	Are there treatments?
181	00:10:51	00:10:52	Antivirals?
182	00:10:54	00:10:56	Nothing effective.
183	00:10:57	00:11:01	So you know everything about the virus except what to do about it.
184	00:11:01	00:11:03	How does this virus end up here?
185	00:11:03	00:11:04	CDC is baffled.
186	00:11:04	00:11:07	The only prior outbreaks were in rural South American villages.
187	00:11:07	00:11:09	Vegas is a global city.
188	00:11:09	00:11:11	People come here from places all over the world.
189	00:11:11	00:11:14	Right. And head back to those places, if you want to play a nightmare scenario.
190	00:11:14	00:11:16	All it takes is one infected carrier.
191	00:11:16	00:11:18	Sneezes in line at the airport.
192	00:11:18	00:11:19	Infecting half a dozen more.
193	00:11:19	00:11:23	By the time the wheels are up, the pathogen's on planes to four continents.
194	00:11:23	00:11:25	That's just getting started.
195	00:11:25	00:11:28	within 48 hours.
196	00:11:28	00:11:31	If you experience a fever, muscle soreness...
197	00:11:31	00:11:32	The fatality rate.
198	00:11:36	00:11:38	80 percent.
199	00:11:41	00:11:42	80 percent?
200	00:11:42	00:11:43	Yes.
201	00:11:45	00:11:46	Thank you, Doctor. Appreciate that.
202	00:11:49	00:11:54	There's nothing we can do about Greg or Sara right now except just...
203	00:11:54	00:11:55	just wait.
204	00:11:56	00:11:58	So let's-let's focus on the case.
205	00:11:58	00:12:00	Somebody else walked out of that bloody room.
206	00:12:00	00:12:04	Yeah, the killer. Who could be anywhere in the city now just spreading the infection.
207	00:12:04	00:12:06	Quicker we determine who that is and where they are...
208	00:12:06	00:12:09	Better chance we have at stopping this outbreak.
209	00:12:10	00:12:11	All right.
210	00:12:26	00:12:27	Don't let your mind go there.
211	00:12:27	00:12:28	That did not happen.
212	00:12:28	00:12:29	We were careful.
213	00:12:29	00:12:31	We always are, working with blood.
214	00:12:31	00:12:32	I know.
215	00:12:32	00:12:34	We had a scare like this before.
216	00:12:34	00:12:37	Yeah, the dead jock with the killer mold in his wall.
217	00:12:37	00:12:40	A quick shared shower in the middle of the street, and we were fine, right?
218	00:12:40	00:12:43	This might not be that easy.
219	00:12:43	00:12:44	We're going to be fine.
220	00:12:47	00:12:48	Hello, Nick?
221	00:12:48	00:12:50	Hey! How are my two favorite people doing?
222	00:12:50	00:12:53	Happy for the distraction.
223	00:12:53	00:12:55	Yeah, I heard they hooked you guys up with some computers.
224	00:12:55	00:12:56	Is that right?
225	00:12:56	00:12:58	Yeah. How's the case going?
226	00:12:58	00:13:01	Well, we just caught a break on the victim's I.D.
227	00:13:01	00:13:05	Got it off of a library book from the photos you guys uploaded.
228	00:13:05	00:13:07	Registered to a guy named Jack Weaver.
229	00:13:07	00:13:08	And listen.
230	00:13:08	00:13:13	This is not this guy's first encounter with a microscopic killer, if you know what I mean.
231	00:13:13	00:13:14	Hunting Viruses.
232	00:13:14	00:13:18	Dr. Jack Weaver travels the world stalking the planet's deadliest organisms.
233	00:13:18	00:13:22	Yeah, now, that article is from about eight years ago.
234	00:13:22	00:13:26	That's right around the time his trail starts to fade.
235	00:13:26	00:13:29	There's no employment records, no Internet presence, nothing.
236	00:13:29	00:13:31	So, what happened to him?
237	00:13:31	00:13:34	I'm not sure about that, but I do know somebody that has the answer.
238	00:13:34	00:13:36	Should have told us already.
239	00:13:36	00:13:38	That is Heather Lanning.
240	00:13:38	00:13:41	Uh, she's an old coworker of Weaver's.
241	00:13:41	00:13:44	They used to do some research together over at RyneLab.
242	00:13:44	00:13:50	And listen, she was in autopsy, she saw the body and never mentioned once that she knew the guy.
243	00:13:51	00:13:57	As counsel for RyneLab, I want to be clear that Miss Lanning is here in the spirit of cooperation to aid in the investigation.
244	00:13:57	00:14:02	Where was that spirit when you neglected to identify Jack Weaver's body?
245	00:14:04	00:14:05	I didn't realize...
246	00:14:05	00:14:07	Ma'am, you worked with him for years.
247	00:14:07	00:14:11	No, RyneLab employs over 500 individuals along with countless affiliated...
248	00:14:11	00:14:13	That face is...
249	00:14:13	00:14:14	a ghost...
250	00:14:14	00:14:15	of the man I knew.
251	00:14:15	00:14:16	So you knew him.
252	00:14:16	00:14:18	Thank you.
253	00:14:18	00:14:20	Why don't you tell me about him.
254	00:14:20	00:14:22	Jack was brilliant.
255	00:14:22	00:14:27	He made breakthroughs in viral research that we're still wrapping our heads around.
256	00:14:27	00:14:30	But the fieldwork...
257	00:14:30	00:14:34	RyneLab's global outreach sends researchers around the world to sites of epidemics...
258	00:14:34	00:14:37	Weeks spent slogging, neck-deep, in disease.
259	00:14:37	00:14:43	Watching mothers fight for a last embrace of their dying child.
260	00:14:43	00:14:45	Those trips took a toll on Jack.
261	00:14:45	00:14:50	Even when we were back safe in the lab, he wasn't the same.
262	00:14:50	00:14:51	Eventually, he had to be let go.
263	00:14:51	00:14:53	It was a tragedy...
264	00:14:53	00:14:54	which...
265	00:14:55	00:14:57	...apparently continued.
266	00:14:59	00:15:04	A virus hunter becomes the virus-hunted, years after the job is left behind.
267	00:15:04	00:15:06	So how did his old prey catch up with him?
268	00:15:06	00:15:09	Ibare has never been discovered in the U.S.
269	00:15:09	00:15:12	Weaver's passport records don't show any recent international travel.
270	00:15:12	00:15:17	The only specimens of the virus within a thousand miles were the ones in RyneLab's freezers.
271	00:15:17	00:15:19	All of which have been inventoried and accounted for.
272	00:15:19	00:15:21	None went missing.
273	00:15:21	00:15:25	Wait a minute. You're saying that this company keeps a stockpile of this virus here in Nevada?
274	00:15:25	00:15:27	That's exactly what I'm saying.
275	00:15:27	00:15:30	With the Defense Department's blessing, of course, and generous funding.
276	00:15:30	00:15:30	Why?
277	00:15:30	00:15:33	Military can't use biological weapons like that.
278	00:15:33	00:15:33	Exactly.
279	00:15:33	00:15:37	Which is why the program goes under the heading Bio-Defense.
280	00:15:37	00:15:46	See, this company cultivates and studies these organisms to prepare for the awfulpossibility that one day they may wind up on U.S. soil.
281	00:15:46	00:15:48	Hey.
282	00:15:48	00:15:51	Police records popped something on Jack Weaver.
283	00:15:51	00:15:54	Field investigation card from last week.
284	00:15:54	00:15:58	Officer responded to a street where Weaver was drunk and prophesizing about a plague.
285	00:15:58	00:16:00	Plague! The world is bleeding!
286	00:16:02	00:16:04	Cop just told him to move on.
287	00:16:04	00:16:06	And a week later his prophecy came true, at least for him.
288	00:16:06	00:16:08	Well, let's not forget, now, he was shot.
289	00:16:08	00:16:12	I can't help but believe that this shooting and the infection are related in some way.
290	00:16:12	00:16:13	What are you thinking?
291	00:16:13	00:16:17	Weaver was broke and bitter, but he still knew a lot about deadly pathogens.
292	00:16:17	00:16:19	May have even had access to one of those connections.
293	00:16:19	00:16:22	Maybe making him the perfect wingman for a bioterrorist.
294	00:16:22	00:16:23	Exactly.
295	00:16:23	00:16:27	Yeah, but the only terror so far happened to Weaver himself.
296	00:16:27	00:16:29	So, something goes awry with the plan.
297	00:16:29	00:16:30	Second thoughts.
298	00:16:30	00:16:32	Sloppy execution.
299	00:16:32	00:16:34	Weaver ends up infected.
300	00:16:34	00:16:35	Coconspirator shoots him to silence him.
301	00:16:35	00:16:40	And that same person makes off with the viral ammo.
302	00:16:40	00:16:41	I saw something in the photos.
303	00:16:41	00:16:43	I wasn't sure what it was. I think I do now.
304	00:16:43	00:16:45	Here.
305	00:16:45	00:16:47	The void in the blood.
306	00:16:47	00:16:48	It's rectangular.
307	00:16:48	00:16:49	It's got round corners.
308	00:16:49	00:16:51	Could very easily be a briefcase.
309	00:16:51	00:16:54	The kind you might use to transport a deadly pathogen.
310	00:16:56	00:16:58	Conrad, we need to get in that house ASAP.
311	00:16:58	00:17:00	No.
312	00:17:00	00:17:02	CDC is saying it's not safe yet.
313	00:17:02	00:17:06	Yeah, but it's safer than leaving a killer and a deadly virus on the street.
314	00:17:07	00:17:09	Well, you put it that way...
315	00:17:10	00:17:13	I'll get you in there.
316	00:17:13	00:17:17	The UV light and formaldehyde nuked all biologicals, so there's no DNA.
317	00:17:17	00:17:19	And no virus.
318	00:17:19	00:17:20	Everything's just how they left it.
319	00:17:22	00:17:24	Lead would still survive.
320	00:17:27	00:17:28	Gunshot was a through-and-through, right?
321	00:17:28	00:17:31	Yeah. So there should still be a bullet here.
322	00:17:31	00:17:32	Okay. Let's go to work.
323	00:17:32	00:17:34	Body was right here.
324	00:17:36	00:17:40	Robbins' report said that the bullet was ricocheted into the vic, right?
325	00:17:40	00:17:42	Right. Well, there's a...
326	00:17:42	00:17:45	there's a bullet skip mark here on the floor.
327	00:17:45	00:17:46	Impacted at a low angle.
328	00:17:46	00:17:49	For Weaver to get shot in the neck means...
329	00:17:49	00:17:50	he must have been laying down.
330	00:17:50	00:17:53	Yeah.
331	00:17:53	00:17:55	Which means the bullet would have to stay low.
332	00:18:00	00:18:02	Oh... Morgan.
333	00:18:02	00:18:03	I think I've got something.
334	00:18:06	00:18:08	I just found the bullet.
335	00:18:10	00:18:12	Greg marked the case right here by the door.
336	00:18:12	00:18:17	Killer would have needed some distance to account for the low-angle bullet skip, so...
337	00:18:19	00:18:20	Shooter stands here...
338	00:18:23	00:18:25	Fires at Weaver, who's prone, sick on the ground.
339	00:18:27	00:18:29	Takes off with the briefcase.
340	00:18:29	00:18:31	And whatever lurks inside of it.
341	00:18:32	00:18:34	That works.
342	00:18:37	00:18:39	Clock is ticking, Sara.
343	00:18:43	00:18:44	It's your move.
344	00:18:46	00:18:48	What if it is starting?
345	00:18:48	00:18:50	An epidemic.
346	00:18:50	00:18:53	What if yesterday was the last normal day?
347	00:18:56	00:19:01	What happened to the optimist who used to share this fishbowl?
348	00:19:02	00:19:04	I'm just thinking.
349	00:19:04	00:19:08	You know how quickly everything could change.
350	00:19:08	00:19:09	You have a headache or a fever.
351	00:19:09	00:19:12	You think it's just a day off of work.
352	00:19:12	00:19:13	Instead...
353	00:19:13	00:19:14	You're booking a trip to Costa Rica.
354	00:19:14	00:19:18	'Cause when we're cleared from here, something good's gonna happen.
355	00:19:20	00:19:22	Motivation for a vacation.
356	00:19:23	00:19:26	Is that really what it takes?
357	00:19:26	00:19:30	Something like this?
358	00:19:30	00:19:32	To do the things you've been putting off.
359	00:19:37	00:19:39	I'll take reminders where we can get them.
360	00:19:44	00:19:48	Hmm. Booking your own tropical vacation?
361	00:19:48	00:19:49	Not exactly.
362	00:19:52	00:19:53	Greg?
363	00:19:53	00:19:54	Hi, Grandma.
364	00:19:54	00:19:55	How have you been?
365	00:19:55	00:19:57	Good.
366	00:19:57	00:19:58	So nice of you to check in on me.
367	00:19:58	00:19:59	How are you?
368	00:19:59	00:20:02	I, uh...
369	00:20:02	00:20:04	It's been an interesting day.
370	00:20:04	00:20:05	Looks sunny there.
371	00:20:05	00:20:07	It's been nice all morning.
372	00:20:07	00:20:09	The garden looks great.
373	00:20:09	00:20:13	Yeah? Well, that's actually why I was calling.
374	00:20:13	00:20:17	Thinking about coming up there to see you and check it out.
375	00:20:17	00:20:19	Oh, Greg, I would love that.
376	00:20:19	00:20:22	Me, too.
377	00:20:22	00:20:24	Heard you found a match on the bullet that killed Weaver.
378	00:20:24	00:20:27	Yep. A recovered round from a gas station holdup six months ago.
379	00:20:27	00:20:32	Case wasn't solved, but we did have a very strong suspect.
380	00:20:32	00:20:35	Northtown nuisance Shawn Steubens.
381	00:20:35	00:20:38	Priors for weapons violations, robbery.
382	00:20:38	00:20:40	Doesn't look like a bioterrorist.
383	00:20:40	00:20:42	Agreed.
384	00:20:42	00:20:43	Let's get him to prove us wrong.
385	00:20:49	00:20:50	Shawn Steubens.
386	00:20:50	00:20:52	LVPD.
387	00:20:52	00:20:53	Open up.
388	00:20:54	00:20:55	Shawn!
389	00:20:55	00:20:58	It's very important that we talk to you!
390	00:21:24	00:21:26	This guy's infected.
391	00:21:40	00:21:42	Tell me that's the cure.
392	00:21:42	00:21:43	It's for your pain.
393	00:21:45	00:21:46	And then what?
394	00:21:53	00:21:55	You want to tell me what happened?
395	00:21:58	00:22:03	Shawn, what's happening to you may be happening to other people.
396	00:22:05	00:22:06	It may be happening to...
397	00:22:08	00:22:13	...two friends of mine that I care about very much.
398	00:22:18	00:22:21	Shawn...
399	00:22:21	00:22:22	I'm begging you, man.
400	00:22:22	00:22:24	Help us out here.
401	00:22:27	00:22:30	Driving around the other night, late...
402	00:22:31	00:22:36	...saw someone go into that house, wearing a big rubber suit like the guys who brought me here.
403	00:22:36	00:22:38	A Hazmat suit?
404	00:22:38	00:22:39	Going in Jack Weaver's house?
405	00:22:39	00:22:40	Yeah.
406	00:22:40	00:22:43	That suit, that part of town, I...
407	00:22:43	00:22:46	figured they had a meth cook going on inside.
408	00:22:46	00:22:49	Then what'd you do, Shawn?
409	00:22:49	00:22:51	Grabbed my nine-mil.
410	00:22:51	00:22:54	Went in to rip the place off.
411	00:22:54	00:22:57	Saw what was really inside.
412	00:22:57	00:22:59	Briefcase looked important.
413	00:22:59	00:23:01	So I grabbed it.
414	00:23:01	00:23:04	I figured maybe it was stuffed with cash.
415	00:23:04	00:23:07	Then that suit was coming at me.
416	00:23:07	00:23:08	I panicked.
417	00:23:11	00:23:13	Shooting that guy was an accident. I swear.
418	00:23:17	00:23:19	You didn't get a good look...
419	00:23:19	00:23:21	at who was in that Hazmat suit, did you?
420	00:23:21	00:23:23	No face, no eyes.
421	00:23:23	00:23:25	And the briefcase, what happened to that?
422	00:23:25	00:23:28	It's at my house.
423	00:23:28	00:23:30	Spent a little while trying to bust it open.
424	00:23:30	00:23:36	Kind of lost interest in the briefcase when, you know, my eyes started bleeding.
425	00:23:40	00:23:44	Well, I'm... I'm gonna leave you to it.
426	00:23:49	00:23:56	Amateur video from the scene shows CDC vehicles and personnel at the North Las Vegas residence.
427	00:23:56	00:24:02	Officials have not released details of what drew this emergency response, but sources report that...
428	00:24:02	00:24:03	The story's still under wraps.
429	00:24:03	00:24:05	At least nobody's panicking.
430	00:24:05	00:24:08	Additionally, it's reported that two veteran Crime Scene Investigators were...
431	00:24:08	00:24:10	Did she just call us veteran?
432	00:24:10	00:24:13	'Cause now I might panic.
433	00:24:13	00:24:16	I can turn this off if it's bugging you.
434	00:24:16	00:24:19	No. No, no, it's fine.
435	00:24:19	00:24:21	...spokesperson isn't releasing any information on their condition at this time.
436	00:24:21	00:24:26	Desert Palm and other local hospitals declined to comment when asked if they had recently...
437	00:24:26	00:24:30	Sara? Are you...?
438	00:24:30	00:24:33	Sara! Sara!
439	00:24:35	00:24:36	We need a doctor!
440	00:24:36	00:24:37	Sara!
441	00:24:37	00:24:38	Somebody!
442	00:24:38	00:24:40	Somebody, please help!
443	00:24:42	00:24:45	Sara! Sara!
444	00:24:46	00:24:47	Sara!
445	00:24:55	00:24:56	Hey, Russell.
446	00:24:56	00:24:59	Hi.
447	00:24:59	00:25:01	They said that you have a...
448	00:25:01	00:25:04	100.4... fever.
449	00:25:04	00:25:11	But her viral antibody tests are still negative, so it could just be a common bug or the stress of all this or...
450	00:25:15	00:25:16	I'm so sorry.
451	00:25:16	00:25:19	They wouldn't let me come any sooner.
452	00:25:19	00:25:22	We know.
453	00:25:25	00:25:30	Russell, I need you to do something for me.
454	00:25:30	00:25:31	Yeah, of course. Anything.
455	00:25:35	00:25:40	If we're gonna die, we need to go out fighting, okay?
456	00:25:40	00:25:42	So, put us to work.
457	00:25:45	00:25:48	Neither one of you have my permission to die.
458	00:25:50	00:25:52	You got that?
459	00:25:55	00:25:57	All right. Uh...
460	00:25:57	00:26:00	Morgan recovered the stolen briefcase.
461	00:26:00	00:26:03	The only thing in it was Jack Weaver's computer.
462	00:26:03	00:26:05	She'll upload his hard drive.
463	00:26:05	00:26:06	She'll get it to you guys.
464	00:26:06	00:26:08	Yeah, we'll start digging.
465	00:26:41	00:26:44	So, you found anything interesting yet?
466	00:26:44	00:26:49	Well, Jack Weaver was obsessed with the Ibare virus long before he was infected with it.
467	00:26:49	00:26:54	His Web histories, cached articles, all dwell on that particular pathogen.
468	00:26:54	00:26:57	Especially one outbreak of it in 2006.
469	00:26:57	00:27:00	The disease tore through a village in Bolivia called Campiza.
470	00:27:00	00:27:02	We know why this was Jack's focus?
471	00:27:02	00:27:05	He did witness the carnage firsthand.
472	00:27:05	00:27:11	He and Heather Lanning were sent to the village to study the outbreak and help with the infected.
473	00:27:11	00:27:17	Yeah, but Weaver did fieldwork at a lot of those outbreaks which is why he burned out, according to Lanning.
474	00:27:17	00:27:19	Wha-What makes that one different?
475	00:27:19	00:27:24	Yeah, we're not sure yet, though, speaking of Lanning, Weaver had been e-mailing with her right up to a week ago.
476	00:27:24	00:27:26	She told me that she hadn't spoken to him for years.
477	00:27:26	00:27:30	Weaver was sending her ramblingmessages saying that they had to talk about Bolivia.
478	00:27:30	00:27:32	Lanning shut him down.
479	00:27:32	00:27:34	Jack, you're a troubled man.
480	00:27:34	00:27:36	You need help. You need to move on.
481	00:27:36	00:27:38	That was five days before we found him dead.
482	00:27:38	00:27:42	Okay, now, Lanning said she didn't recognize Weaver's body, and I let that slide.
483	00:27:42	00:27:44	But obviously she's hiding something.
484	00:27:44	00:27:45	Mr. Russell?
485	00:27:49	00:27:50	Yeah. My name is Rudy Adela.
486	00:27:50	00:27:52	We met earlier.
487	00:27:52	00:27:53	Yeah, you're the attorney for RyneLab, right?
488	00:27:53	00:27:57	I was informed by our research tech at RyneLab of a missing agent.
489	00:27:57	00:27:59	A vial of the Ibare virus.
490	00:28:03	00:28:05	You got something there?
491	00:28:07	00:28:10	I, uh, asked Dr. Lanning about it.
492	00:28:15	00:28:16	Rudy, the loss cannot be reported.
493	00:28:16	00:28:18	We can't just ignore it.
494	00:28:18	00:28:21	You don't say a word to anyone.
495	00:28:21	00:28:24	How much was in that vial? It's ten cc's.
496	00:28:24	00:28:27	20 million virion particles.
497	00:28:29	00:28:31	And each one a potential death sentence.
498	00:28:36	00:28:42	Your company lost a potential weapon of mass destruction, and then you covered it up, at the very least.
499	00:28:42	00:28:45	What are you accusing me of?
500	00:28:45	00:28:46	I'm here without an attorney.
501	00:28:46	00:28:48	Doesn't that tell you something about my...
502	00:28:48	00:28:52	Tells me something about your attorney's conscience, actually.
503	00:28:52	00:28:56	Now, contrary to what you told us, you were in contact with Jack Weaver.
504	00:28:56	00:28:57	These are the e-mails.
505	00:28:57	00:28:59	He wanted to talk to you about Bolivia.
506	00:28:59	00:29:01	I told you he wasn't stable.
507	00:29:01	00:29:02	He needed help.
508	00:29:02	00:29:08	Ms. Lanning, we're working with the CDC now, under a federal order.
509	00:29:08	00:29:11	As we speak, we're tearing apart your offices.
510	00:29:11	00:29:13	Every file, every hard drive.
511	00:29:13	00:29:16	And we just got this in from your building surveillance.
512	00:29:16	00:29:22	That's you walking Jack Weaver into the facility, after hours, a week before he died.
513	00:29:22	00:29:26	I thought bringing him there, talking, might remind him of all the good work he did.
514	00:29:26	00:29:28	No, that's not true.
515	00:29:28	00:29:29	Once again, these are the e-mails.
516	00:29:29	00:29:31	He demanded to meet you there.
517	00:29:31	00:29:35	And because you went along with it, I'm guessing he had some sort of leverage.
518	00:29:35	00:29:37	He had my pity.
519	00:29:37	00:29:39	I was trying to help him.
520	00:29:39	00:29:45	Ms. Lanning, a man who's obsessed with the Ibare virus visits the lab.
521	00:29:45	00:29:47	A vial of that virus goes missing.
522	00:29:47	00:29:50	And that same pathogen kills him within days.
523	00:29:50	00:29:52	You think he...
524	00:29:52	00:29:54	No.
525	00:29:54	00:29:56	I didn't let him near anywhere near the specimen storage.
526	00:29:56	00:29:59	So, he was never out of your sight, even for a moment?
527	00:29:59	00:30:01	Maybe for... two minutes.
528	00:30:01	00:30:03	He went to use the men's room, but...
529	00:30:03	00:30:04	Uh-huh, yeah.
530	00:30:04	00:30:06	That man had worked in that building for years.
531	00:30:06	00:30:08	He knew how to access the specimens.
532	00:30:08	00:30:10	He could have gotten in and out of there in two minutes.
533	00:30:10	00:30:12	And you know it.
534	00:30:14	00:30:16	Here's what I think.
535	00:30:16	00:30:21	I believe that you realized your mistake, so you went to his home.
536	00:30:21	00:30:24	You wanted to keep track of Jack and the missing vial.
537	00:30:24	00:30:25	Kind of damage control.
538	00:30:25	00:30:26	No! That's not...
539	00:30:26	00:30:31	By the time you got there, Jack Weaver had already infected himself.
540	00:30:31	00:30:32	And what?
541	00:30:32	00:30:34	I just let him die?
542	00:30:34	00:30:35	That's what I think, yeah.
543	00:30:35	00:30:40	I think you realized that if your mistake came out that your labs would be shut down.
544	00:30:40	00:30:42	So you watched him crash and bleed out.
545	00:30:42	00:30:47	And then you were gonna dispose of his body, but someone came along and ruined your plan.
546	00:30:51	00:30:52	So you panicked...
547	00:30:52	00:30:57	and you left behind the body and the blood for my CSIs to walk into.
548	00:30:59	00:31:01	I'm done talking about it.
549	00:31:01	00:31:02	I want an attorney.
550	00:31:02	00:31:03	Good idea.
551	00:31:04	00:31:09	Russell spins a hell of a theory, but we still don't know why Weaver took the vial or how he ended up infected.
552	00:31:09	00:31:12	I think infecting himself with that virus was the whole point.
553	00:31:12	00:31:14	Conrad, he knew the dangers.
554	00:31:14	00:31:15	This was no accident.
555	00:31:15	00:31:16	What do you mean?
556	00:31:16	00:31:20	I'm saying that Weaver knew something about RyneLab, something major.
557	00:31:20	00:31:24	What? I don't know yet, but he hints about it in his e-mails.
558	00:31:24	00:31:28	I think exposing himself to this virus was his way of exposing that whole company.
559	00:31:28	00:31:29	All right, so he got our attention.
560	00:31:29	00:31:31	What did he want us to know?
561	00:31:31	00:31:37	Morgan and I are going over the files right now, but my gut tells me '06 Bolivian outbreak seems to have been his obsession.
562	00:31:37	00:31:40	Well, let's make it our obsession-- and quickly.
563	00:31:40	00:31:42	RyneLab's got a lot of juice in DC.
564	00:31:42	00:31:44	Our investigation could get shut down any minute.
565	00:31:44	00:31:45	I'm on it.
566	00:31:51	00:31:53	Hey.
567	00:31:54	00:31:57	Reports all tell the same tale.
568	00:31:57	00:32:05	Lanning and Weaver arrived at the Bolivian village two days after the first infections were reported, identified the pathogen as Ibare.
569	00:32:05	00:32:07	Yeah, they treated and contained the sick in a field hospital.
570	00:32:07	00:32:09	20 infected, 17 dead.
571	00:32:09	00:32:12	Then the virus just ran its course.
572	00:32:12	00:32:14	Her field reports, her journals, they're all consistent.
573	00:32:14	00:32:17	So, what are we missing?
574	00:32:35	00:32:37	What is it?
575	00:32:37	00:32:39	It was collected from Lanning's desk at RyneLab.
576	00:32:39	00:32:41	What is that?
577	00:32:41	00:32:45	It's from Bolivia, to Heather's home address here.
578	00:32:45	00:32:47	Postmarked...
579	00:32:47	00:32:48	around the end of the outbreak.
580	00:32:51	00:32:54	It's a letter from Heather to herself.
581	00:32:54	00:32:56	Why would somebody do something like that?
582	00:32:58	00:32:59	Because she couldn't tell anybody else.
583	00:32:59	00:33:01	Read it.
584	00:33:01	00:33:07	Let the reports and lab records tally the dead and the lucky.
585	00:33:07	00:33:12	But for my own sanity, I need to put down what I saw.
586	00:33:12	00:33:14	To remember that it happened.
587	00:33:14	00:33:16	So that it never happens again.
588	00:33:18	00:33:21	It's not our call, Jack.
589	00:33:21	00:33:22	The directive for RyneLab was clear.
590	00:33:22	00:33:24	Yeah. Lie to them.
591	00:33:24	00:33:27	Tell these people their family members aren't dying in there.
592	00:33:27	00:33:30	We don't have the manpower to deal with a panic.
593	00:33:30	00:33:32	We need to maintain the quarantine.
594	00:33:32	00:33:33	What is happening in there?
595	00:33:40	00:33:42	You tell us nothing.
596	00:33:47	00:33:48	It's a fever.
597	00:33:48	00:33:50	It's just a fever.
598	00:33:50	00:33:52	They're gonna be fine.
599	00:33:52	00:33:54	Fever?
600	00:33:57	00:34:00	Then we will care for them at home.
601	00:34:00	00:34:03	No. You can't go in.
602	00:34:03	00:34:04	We need to treat them here. (speaking Spanish)
603	00:34:04	00:34:06	Stop!
604	00:34:07	00:34:08	Please... don't touch them! Wait.
605	00:34:08	00:34:15	The official reports will simply show a spike of 15 new infections, 12 of them fatal.
606	00:34:15	00:34:18	But Jack and I know the truth about the numbers.
607	00:34:20	00:34:22	And we will have to live with it.
608	00:34:24	00:34:28	Well, it sounds like she figured out how to live with it, but he didn't.
609	00:34:28	00:34:30	Well, suicide wasn't enough.
610	00:34:30	00:34:31	It's too easy.
611	00:34:31	00:34:35	No, he infected himself because he wanted to empathize with these victims.
612	00:34:35	00:34:37	To feel the pain his lie caused.
613	00:34:37	00:34:39	We have to prove it.
614	00:34:39	00:34:43	We have to prove that he stole the virus from RyneLab's facility.
615	00:34:55	00:34:56	Any luck?
616	00:34:56	00:35:00	One tiny partial print-- it won't be any help, except to tell us that...
617	00:35:00	00:35:02	somebody opened this container without wearing gloves.
618	00:35:02	00:35:05	Well, the swabs I took didn't find any touch DNA.
619	00:35:05	00:35:07	No useable prints, no DNA.
620	00:35:10	00:35:12	There is something else to try.
621	00:35:12	00:35:14	Morgan, what's unique about this room?
622	00:35:14	00:35:16	Freezers full of exotic death.
623	00:35:16	00:35:21	Aside from those contained organisms, there's no life in here, but the room's kept spotless.
624	00:35:21	00:35:25	Every person who enters, per protocol, is wrapped in rubber.
625	00:35:25	00:35:26	Except for one person who broke protocol.
626	00:35:26	00:35:29	You're thinking microbial forensics.
627	00:35:29	00:35:30	You're familiar with the process?
628	00:35:30	00:35:32	I-I've read a little bit about it, but...
629	00:35:32	00:35:34	This is theperfect chance to try it.
630	00:35:34	00:35:39	The only microbes living on that surface would have been contributed by that single ungloved person.
631	00:35:39	00:35:42	Every person has a a unique mix of organisms on their skin.
632	00:35:42	00:35:45	Some they're born with, some they accumulate.
633	00:35:45	00:35:48	The combination is as singular as a fingerprint or DNA.
634	00:35:48	00:35:54	Other scenes, there are far too many microbes on every single surface to ever distinguish between contributors, but here...
635	00:35:55	00:35:57	whoever stole the virus.
636	00:35:57	00:35:59	I'll call Russell...
637	00:35:59	00:36:03	see if we can commandeer RyneLab's equipment, do a microbial analysis.
638	00:36:44	00:36:54	So, I cultured the microbial population from the swab... I spread it over various agars, each formulated to breed particular organisms if they're present.
639	00:36:54	00:36:59	Each positive I.D. we get of a species gets us one step closer to a microbial profile.
640	00:36:59	00:37:00	And our suspect.
641	00:37:00	00:37:02	Yeah. (phone chimes)
642	00:37:04	00:37:06	Hey, Nick. What's up?
643	00:37:06	00:37:10	I was going over the Bolivia files with Russell, you know, explaining everything.
644	00:37:10	00:37:13	Yeah? We noticed something in one of the photos of the village.
645	00:37:13	00:37:15	What?
646	00:37:15	00:37:16	Prepare to have your stomach drop.
647	00:37:18	00:37:20	Eight years ago...
648	00:37:20	00:37:22	half a world away...
649	00:37:23	00:37:24	...but...
650	00:37:24	00:37:26	that's you.
651	00:37:28	00:37:31	I haven't seen this photo.
652	00:37:31	00:37:32	But I remember everything.
653	00:37:32	00:37:35	Your family were among those who were infected in the village, right?
654	00:37:35	00:37:38	Both of my parents...
655	00:37:38	00:37:40	my sister...
656	00:37:40	00:37:42	all killed.
657	00:37:42	00:37:44	I was, um...
658	00:37:44	00:37:45	theluckyone.
659	00:37:48	00:37:53	Can't be a coincidence that you're working for RyneLab now.
660	00:37:53	00:37:57	Same organization that handled the outbreak all those years ago.
661	00:37:57	00:37:59	The company looked out for us.
662	00:37:59	00:38:01	The kids left behind.
663	00:38:01	00:38:03	Oh, I heard that. I heard that they...
664	00:38:03	00:38:05	they sent you to school in La Paz, right?
665	00:38:05	00:38:06	They...
666	00:38:06	00:38:08	paid for your college?
667	00:38:09	00:38:11	I wanted to work for them.
668	00:38:11	00:38:14	Help study monsters like Ibare.
669	00:38:14	00:38:19	Turns out I didn't have a mind for science, but a law degree got me in the door.
670	00:38:20	00:38:22	Rudy...
671	00:38:22	00:38:25	we know you found out what happened in your village.
672	00:38:25	00:38:27	I mean, the real story.
673	00:38:27	00:38:33	We took your fingerprints off of Heather Lanning's letter, which you found hidden in her office.
674	00:38:33	00:38:37	I heard rumors back then that RyneLab had caused the deaths, so...
675	00:38:37	00:38:39	I used my access to get answers.
676	00:38:39	00:38:45	And when you got your answers and you found out that Jack Weaver was responsible, you wanted revenge.
677	00:38:45	00:38:46	I understand.
678	00:38:48	00:38:50	Okay. Rudy...
679	00:38:50	00:38:58	my CSIs have developed a microbial profile of the hand that... that opened the refrigeration unit and stole the vial of Ibare.
680	00:38:58	00:39:04	A zoo of different organisms all living in harmony on a... on a fingertip.
681	00:39:04	00:39:09	And that same unique combination of life was found on this-- your recorder.
682	00:39:11	00:39:14	You stole the vial, Rudy.
683	00:39:14	00:39:16	And you infected Jack Weaver.
684	00:39:19	00:39:22	My entire family.
685	00:39:24	00:39:25	They didn't deserve it.
686	00:39:27	00:39:28	He did.
687	00:39:39	00:39:42	I stayed there.
688	00:39:42	00:39:44	I watched him suffer.
689	00:39:44	00:39:46	Then I watched the company lie to you.
690	00:39:46	00:39:48	Distance themselves.
691	00:39:48	00:39:50	Cover up.
692	00:39:50	00:39:52	Just like they did allthose years ago.
693	00:39:52	00:39:55	Which is why you recorded Dr. Lanning.
694	00:39:55	00:40:04	You wanted to bring down the whole company, so they couldn't toy with any more viruses, breed any more monsters.
695	00:40:04	00:40:06	I...
696	00:40:06	00:40:08	would be the last.
697	00:40:33	00:40:35	Sara?
698	00:40:37	00:40:38	Are you...? I'm fine.
699	00:40:38	00:40:40	Dr. Emmett said that I could tell you the news.
700	00:40:40	00:40:46	No sign of infection, and tests are showing that the virus dies within two hours of exposure to air.
701	00:40:50	00:40:53	Weaver's house wouldn't have been infectious when we entered.
702	00:40:53	00:40:54	No.
703	00:40:54	00:40:57	CDC's gonna keep an area watch, but there haven't been any other infections.
704	00:40:57	00:40:58	We're clear.
705	00:41:00	00:41:01	We're free to go.
706	00:41:10	00:41:12	What are we waiting for?
707	00:41:14	00:41:15	I'm starving.
708	00:41:15	00:41:17	Me, too. Breakfast?
709	00:41:17	00:41:18	Coffee.
710	00:41:18	00:41:20	Yeah.
711	00:41:20	00:41:22	Yeah.
712	00:41:28	00:41:30	Hey, Dave.
713	00:41:30	00:41:31	I spoke with your doctor.
714	00:41:31	00:41:32	You're both okay.
715	00:41:34	00:41:36	Uh, we were about to grab a bite to eat.
716	00:41:36	00:41:37	Want to join us?
717	00:41:37	00:41:39	I'd love to...
718	00:41:39	00:41:41	but I'm actually here for work.
719	00:41:41	00:41:45	Shawn Steubens, the kid who got infected...
720	00:41:45	00:41:46	He didn't make it.
721	00:41:46	00:41:47	He wasn't so lucky.
722	00:41:47	00:41:49	It goes without saying...
723	00:41:49	00:41:53	but I'm just really glad you're both okay.
724	00:42:00	00:42:02	Goes without saying.
725	00:42:02	00:42:03	Yeah.
