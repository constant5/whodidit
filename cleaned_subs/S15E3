0,00:00:03,00:00:05,MAN: It will come to pass!
1,00:00:05,00:00:07,It's just a matter of time.
2,00:00:07,00:00:09,You can only lie to yourselves for so long.
3,00:00:09,00:00:11,We pretend that we're not afraid.
4,00:00:11,00:00:15,But when it happens and that day comes...
5,00:00:15,00:00:19,nothing will stop the world from bleeding.
6,00:00:20,00:00:21,Nothing!
7,00:00:24,00:00:26,(door opens)
8,00:00:28,00:00:31,I spoke with responding officers.
9,00:00:31,00:00:35,"Landlord came by here to pick up the rent, saw him and turned right around."
10,00:00:35,00:00:37,Tenant's name is Jack Smith.
11,00:00:37,00:00:38,He lived alone.
12,00:00:38,00:00:41,Sounds like a throwaway name.
13,00:00:41,00:00:45,"Let me guess: paid all cash, no I.D. on file."
14,00:00:45,00:00:47,Lifestyles of the broke and anonymous.
15,00:00:47,00:00:49,This place is covered in blood.
16,00:00:50,00:00:52,There's blood on the floor.
17,00:00:52,00:00:54,There's more on the wall.
18,00:00:55,00:00:57,It's all over the place.
19,00:01:02,00:01:05,Blood void. Got a spent shell over here.
20,00:01:05,00:01:06,Nine-mil casing.
21,00:01:07,00:01:08,SIDLE: GSW to his neck.
22,00:01:08,00:01:11,Looks like he bled out pretty quickly.
23,00:01:11,00:01:14,Yeah? Then how did blood get all over the room?
24,00:01:14,00:01:16,Expirated blood on the wall here.
25,00:01:18,00:01:20,Possible fight before the kill shot?
26,00:01:20,00:01:24,"Well, if we're lucky, maybe some of this blood belongs to his assailant."
27,00:01:30,00:01:36,"This whole bookshelf is about world-ending plagues, biological disasters..."
28,00:01:42,00:01:44,The wall is just plastered with paranoia.
29,00:01:45,00:01:47,Uh... Greg?
30,00:01:47,00:01:48,Yeah?
31,00:01:48,00:01:50,This man was sick.
32,00:01:50,00:01:51,What do you mean?
33,00:01:51,00:01:53,"I mean, don't touch anything."
34,00:01:53,00:01:55,"I'm, uh, uh... I'm gonna call the CDC."
35,00:01:55,00:01:57,His eye.
36,00:01:57,00:01:59,Have you ever seen anything like that before?
37,00:01:59,00:02:01,"SANDERS: Yeah, in biology textbooks."
38,00:02:02,00:02:04,Viral epidemics.
39,00:02:04,00:02:05,Exactly.
40,00:02:06,00:02:09,SANDERS: The pathogen could be in all this blood.
41,00:02:11,00:02:12,It could be airborne.
42,00:02:12,00:02:13,Try not to panic.
43,00:02:13,00:02:15,I'm just trying not to breathe.
44,00:02:15,00:02:18,SIDLE: This is CSI Sara Sidle from the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
45,00:02:18,00:02:22,I'm at a crime scene with what appears to be a possible hemorrhagic fever.
46,00:02:22,00:02:24,One decedent.
47,00:02:27,00:02:29,Two others may have been exposed.
48,00:03:16,00:03:17,Let's go! Get the windows sealed!
49,00:03:17,00:03:19,Secure the perimeter!
50,00:03:19,00:03:22,No entry without Level Four coverage.
51,00:03:22,00:03:23,Keep it moving!
52,00:03:23,00:03:24,Clock is ticking!
53,00:03:27,00:03:28,PHILLIPS: Hey.
54,00:03:28,00:03:30,Russell. I'm so sorry.
55,00:03:30,00:03:31,I should've been the first one in there.
56,00:03:31,00:03:33,I-I got stuck at that suicide over on...
57,00:03:33,00:03:36,Relax. You were just doing your job. Coroner's office?
58,00:03:36,00:03:40,Yeah. He'll get you suited up for entry to remove the infected decedent. Of course.
59,00:03:40,00:03:42,Supervisor Russell?
60,00:03:42,00:03:45,"Yes. Dr. Emmett, CDC Emergency Response Specialist."
61,00:03:45,00:03:47,Any idea what we're dealing with here?
62,00:03:47,00:03:49,"Undetermined, but the symptoms suggest a virus."
63,00:03:49,00:03:51,We're treating the house as a hot zone.
64,00:03:51,00:03:52,Extracting the potentially exposed subjects.
65,00:03:52,00:03:54,"Those ""subjects"" are my CSIs."
66,00:03:54,00:03:56,I just spoke to them on the phone.
67,00:03:56,00:03:58,They're a little concerned about what's happening next.
68,00:03:58,00:04:01,They'll be suited up and transported to hospital quarantine.
69,00:04:01,00:04:03,They mention having removed anything from inside the house?
70,00:04:03,00:04:04,"No. No, no, no."
71,00:04:04,00:04:08,"All their gear, their collected evidence, is still inside. Good. It'll stay there."
72,00:04:08,00:04:09,"Once the subjects are out, we'll nuke the place."
73,00:04:09,00:04:10,"Wait, wait, I'm sorry."
74,00:04:10,00:04:11,"What do you mean, ""nuke""?"
75,00:04:11,00:04:15,"Blast it with UV light and formaldehyde fog, killing any living organism in there."
76,00:04:15,00:04:17,There's our artillery now.
77,00:04:17,00:04:19,RUSSELL: Well... wait a sec.
78,00:04:19,00:04:22,The dead man in there was-was killed by a gunshot.
79,00:04:22,00:04:24,I heard. Not his day at the tables.
80,00:04:24,00:04:29,What I'm saying is there was at least one other person-- the shooter-- inside that room.
81,00:04:29,00:04:30,And he might be infected.
82,00:04:30,00:04:35,So frying all the biologicals in there might stop us from tracking the guy down.
83,00:04:35,00:04:36,A valid point.
84,00:04:36,00:04:38,But no match for the holy gospel of protocol.
85,00:04:38,00:04:39,I'll keep you updated.
86,00:04:39,00:04:41,"(helicopter whirring, indistinct radio chatter)"
87,00:04:55,00:04:56,You okay in there?
88,00:04:56,00:04:59,We had to leave the evidence behind.
89,00:04:59,00:05:01,SANDERS: Scene's getting completely stepped on in there.
90,00:05:01,00:05:03,We uploaded our photos to the cloud.
91,00:05:03,00:05:05,It might be all we can salvage.
92,00:05:05,00:05:06,I'm not concerned about that right now.
93,00:05:06,00:05:08,"EMMETT: Folks, we need to keep moving!"
94,00:06:19,00:06:23,"RUSSELL: If they've been infected, we may not know for days."
95,00:06:23,00:06:30,"Viral incubation period could be up to two weeks, you know, so they'll be tested, observed, and... I don't know, we just wait, I guess."
96,00:06:30,00:06:32,"This is rough, D.B."
97,00:06:32,00:06:33,State's sending resources.
98,00:06:33,00:06:34,Area hospitals are on alert.
99,00:06:34,00:06:37,"I mean, soon the story's gonna hit the news, and then everything gets cranked up."
100,00:06:37,00:06:40,I've got Morgan and Nick going over the crime scene photos.
101,00:06:40,00:06:43,"On top of all this, we have a... a murder to solve."
102,00:06:43,00:06:46,"Yeah, right. Gunshot in the throat almost feels quaint, doesn't it?"
103,00:06:46,00:06:47,Supervisor Russell? Yes.
104,00:06:47,00:06:49,"Dr. Heather Lanning, from RyneLab Biomedical."
105,00:06:49,00:06:52,My counterpart at the CDC informed you I'd be here?
106,00:06:52,00:06:54,Yeah. This is... Sheriff Ecklie. Hi.
107,00:06:54,00:06:55,Hi.
108,00:06:55,00:06:57,I understand the situation's overwhelming.
109,00:06:57,00:06:58,I'm here to help.
110,00:06:58,00:07:01,RyneLab is a private research facility right here in Nevada.
111,00:07:01,00:07:05,"The only Biosafety Level Four site in the region, equipped to handle the deadliest organisms."
112,00:07:05,00:07:08,CDC brought us in to assist on this case.
113,00:07:08,00:07:11,"So your lab's gonna tell us what kind of bug we're dealing with here, right?"
114,00:07:11,00:07:14,Because two of my team may have been infected.
115,00:07:14,00:07:15,I understand.
116,00:07:15,00:07:18,If I can start with a look at the damage inflicted...
117,00:07:18,00:07:20,"Okay, I got this. Why don't you check in with your team? Right."
118,00:07:20,00:07:22,"Right this way, please. Okay."
119,00:07:23,00:07:25,(saw buzzing)
120,00:07:30,00:07:31,Surgical scissors would be safer.
121,00:07:31,00:07:36,You risk puncturing your suit with that blade and infecting yourself.
122,00:07:36,00:07:38,(saw stops buzzing)
123,00:07:38,00:07:40,This is Dr. Lanning from RyneLab.
124,00:07:40,00:07:41,Helping with the case.
125,00:07:41,00:07:46,"I appreciate your concern, but believe me, I've never cut more carefully in my life."
126,00:07:46,00:07:49,"ECKLIE: So what do we have, Doc?"
127,00:07:49,00:07:51,"Well, starting with the gunshot wound, it's a through-and-through."
128,00:07:51,00:07:53,There's no sooting or stippling.
129,00:07:53,00:07:55,The entry wound is irregular.
130,00:07:55,00:07:57,It suggests a ricochet before impact.
131,00:08:00,00:08:01,(saw buzzing)
132,00:08:01,00:08:07,"I found no I.D. or possessions in his pockets, and there was no print match through Mobile AFIS."
133,00:08:07,00:08:09,ECKLIE: So we're still not even sure of his name.
134,00:08:09,00:08:13,"A true ""Patient Zero."" No way to build a profile..."
135,00:08:13,00:08:15,who or what he may have had contact with.
136,00:08:19,00:08:21,(exhales)
137,00:08:29,00:08:35,"ROBBINS: The lungs are soft, hemorrhagic, and the spleen is mushy."
138,00:08:35,00:08:37,Consistent with a filovirus infection.
139,00:08:39,00:08:41,Like Marburg or Ebola.
140,00:08:45,00:08:47,"No. No, I disagree, Jules."
141,00:08:47,00:08:48,I don't think you should fly back.
142,00:08:48,00:08:53,"I mean, if this thing turns into a real outbreak, I think you're better off in Seattle."
143,00:08:53,00:08:56,"Well, how long till we have an update on Sara and Greg?"
144,00:08:56,00:08:59,"RUSSELL: They're still being tested, so they couldn't take any calls."
145,00:08:59,00:09:01,I wish there was something I could do to help.
146,00:09:01,00:09:02,I know.
147,00:09:02,00:09:06,You could tell me you've found something on our Gig Harbor twins.
148,00:09:06,00:09:10,I am still trying to put together Winthrop and Briscoe's backgrounds.
149,00:09:10,00:09:14,"You know, both men have lived without leaving much of a trail."
150,00:09:14,00:09:21,"But I'm going through hospital records right now, and searching for identical twins born to unwed Seattle mothers."
151,00:09:21,00:09:24,Ages that would obviously be right for them.
152,00:09:24,00:09:25,"You know, I just need a birth date."
153,00:09:25,00:09:27,It would really help me with foster searches.
154,00:09:27,00:09:31,"All right. Well, it's a start. Enough to keep fishing, don't you think? Mm-hmm."
155,00:09:31,00:09:33,Will you call me if you hear anything?
156,00:09:33,00:09:34,Of course I will.
157,00:09:40,00:09:41,BRODY: Hey.
158,00:09:41,00:09:43,So I talked to the CDC rep.
159,00:09:43,00:09:46,I told him that we need to be in that house as soon as possible.
160,00:09:46,00:09:49,I know all that DNA evidence is gonna be destroyed.
161,00:09:49,00:09:52,All we have right now are the photos that they uploaded.
162,00:09:52,00:09:55,"Overalls, uh, shots of blood spatter."
163,00:09:55,00:09:57,I don't know what we're going to get from these.
164,00:09:57,00:10:01,"Just like any other case, we need to find out who this victim is first."
165,00:10:01,00:10:05,"Maybe some small detail will tell us where he's been, who he's been hanging out with..."
166,00:10:05,00:10:06,Who else might have been infected.
167,00:10:06,00:10:07,"Yeah, exactly."
168,00:10:07,00:10:12,"So I'm just scanning these, looking for an I.D. badge, a piece of mail... Yeah."
169,00:10:12,00:10:13,Wait. What about that book?
170,00:10:13,00:10:15,Seconds to Apocalypse.
171,00:10:15,00:10:17,"Yeah, it's got a library tag on the spine."
172,00:10:17,00:10:20,That might just work. He might have a-an account at the library.
173,00:10:20,00:10:22,It could help us with the I.D. Yeah.
174,00:10:22,00:10:23,It's worth a shot. (phone chiming)
175,00:10:23,00:10:25,"Yeah, there's Russell."
176,00:10:25,00:10:26,He's in Layout.
177,00:10:26,00:10:27,He's got some news. Let's go.
178,00:10:27,00:10:28,Yeah.
179,00:10:30,00:10:31,LANNING: Sara.
180,00:10:31,00:10:32,Greg.
181,00:10:32,00:10:36,I'm here to tell you that RyneLab has identified the pathogen.
182,00:10:37,00:10:39,EMMETT: It's called the Ibare virus.
183,00:10:39,00:10:43,"A blood-borne filovirus, not unlike Ebola in viral structure."
184,00:10:43,00:10:50,"It replicates at a staggering rate, decimating the host's cells and causing massive hemorrhage."
185,00:10:50,00:10:51,SIDLE: Are there treatments?
186,00:10:51,00:10:52,Antivirals?
187,00:10:54,00:10:56,Nothing effective.
188,00:10:57,00:11:01,So you know everything about the virus except what to do about it.
189,00:11:01,00:11:03,How does this virus end up here?
190,00:11:03,00:11:04,CDC is baffled.
191,00:11:04,00:11:07,The only prior outbreaks were in rural South American villages.
192,00:11:07,00:11:09,Vegas is a global city.
193,00:11:09,00:11:11,People come here from places all over the world.
194,00:11:11,00:11:14,"Right. And head back to those places, if you want to play a nightmare scenario."
195,00:11:14,00:11:16,All it takes is one infected carrier.
196,00:11:16,00:11:18,Sneezes in line at the airport.
197,00:11:18,00:11:19,Infecting half a dozen more.
198,00:11:19,00:11:23,"By the time the wheels are up, the pathogen's on planes to four continents."
199,00:11:23,00:11:25,That's just getting started.
200,00:11:25,00:11:28,Ibare has a rapid incubation period: within 48 hours.
201,00:11:28,00:11:31,"If you experience a fever, muscle soreness..."
202,00:11:31,00:11:32,The fatality rate.
203,00:11:36,00:11:38,80 percent.
204,00:11:41,00:11:42,80 percent?
205,00:11:42,00:11:43,Yes.
206,00:11:45,00:11:46,"Thank you, Doctor. Appreciate that."
207,00:11:49,00:11:54,There's nothing we can do about Greg or Sara right now except just...
208,00:11:54,00:11:55,just wait.
209,00:11:56,00:11:58,So let's-let's focus on the case.
210,00:11:58,00:12:00,Somebody else walked out of that bloody room.
211,00:12:00,00:12:04,"Yeah, the killer. Who could be anywhere in the city now just spreading the infection."
212,00:12:04,00:12:06,STOKES: Quicker we determine who that is and where they are...
213,00:12:06,00:12:09,Better chance we have at stopping this outbreak.
214,00:12:10,00:12:11,All right.
215,00:12:26,00:12:27,SIDLE: Don't let your mind go there.
216,00:12:27,00:12:28,That did not happen.
217,00:12:28,00:12:29,We were careful.
218,00:12:29,00:12:31,"We always are, working with blood."
219,00:12:31,00:12:32,I know.
220,00:12:32,00:12:34,We had a scare like this before.
221,00:12:34,00:12:37,"Yeah, the dead jock with the killer mold in his wall."
222,00:12:37,00:12:40,"A quick shared shower in the middle of the street, and we were fine, right?"
223,00:12:40,00:12:43,This might not be that easy.
224,00:12:43,00:12:44,We're going to be fine.
225,00:12:44,00:12:46,(computer beeping)
226,00:12:47,00:12:48,"Hello, Nick?"
227,00:12:48,00:12:50,Hey! How are my two favorite people doing?
228,00:12:50,00:12:53,Happy for the distraction.
229,00:12:53,00:12:55,"Yeah, I heard they hooked you guys up with some computers."
230,00:12:55,00:12:56,Is that right?
231,00:12:56,00:12:58,Yeah. How's the case going?
232,00:12:58,00:13:01,"Well, we just caught a break on the victim's I.D."
233,00:13:01,00:13:05,Got it off of a library book from the photos you guys uploaded.
234,00:13:05,00:13:07,Registered to a guy named Jack Weaver.
235,00:13:07,00:13:08,And listen.
236,00:13:08,00:13:13,"This is not this guy's first encounter with a microscopic killer, if you know what I mean."
237,00:13:13,00:13:14,"SIDLE: ""Hunting Viruses."
238,00:13:14,00:13:22,"""Dr. Jack Weaver travels the world stalking the planet's deadliest organisms."" Yeah, now, that article is from about eight years ago."
239,00:13:22,00:13:26,That's right around the time his trail starts to fade.
240,00:13:26,00:13:29,"There's no employment records, no Internet presence, nothing."
241,00:13:29,00:13:31,"So, what happened to him?"
242,00:13:31,00:13:34,"I'm not sure about that, but I do know somebody that has the answer."
243,00:13:34,00:13:36,Should have told us already.
244,00:13:36,00:13:38,That is Heather Lanning.
245,00:13:38,00:13:41,"Uh, she's an old coworker of Weaver's."
246,00:13:41,00:13:44,They used to do some research together over at RyneLab.
247,00:13:44,00:13:50,"And listen, she was in autopsy, she saw the body and never mentioned once that she knew the guy."
248,00:13:51,00:13:57,"MAN: As counsel for RyneLab, I want to be clear that Miss Lanning is here in the spirit of cooperation to aid in the investigation."
249,00:13:57,00:14:02,Where was that spirit when you neglected to identify Jack Weaver's body?
250,00:14:04,00:14:05,I didn't realize...
251,00:14:05,00:14:07,"Ma'am, you worked with him for years."
252,00:14:07,00:14:11,"No, RyneLab employs over 500 individuals along with countless affiliated..."
253,00:14:11,00:14:13,That face is...
254,00:14:13,00:14:14,a ghost...
255,00:14:14,00:14:15,of the man I knew.
256,00:14:15,00:14:16,So you knew him.
257,00:14:16,00:14:18,Thank you.
258,00:14:18,00:14:20,Why don't you tell me about him.
259,00:14:20,00:14:22,Jack was brilliant.
260,00:14:22,00:14:27,He made breakthroughs in viral research that we're still wrapping our heads around.
261,00:14:27,00:14:30,But the fieldwork...
262,00:14:30,00:14:34,RyneLab's global outreach sends researchers around the world to sites of epidemics...
263,00:14:34,00:14:37,"Weeks spent slogging, neck-deep, in disease."
264,00:14:37,00:14:43,Watching mothers fight for a last embrace of their dying child.
265,00:14:43,00:14:45,Those trips took a toll on Jack.
266,00:14:45,00:14:50,"Even when we were back safe in the lab, he wasn't the same."
267,00:14:50,00:14:51,"Eventually, he had to be let go."
268,00:14:51,00:14:53,It was a tragedy...
269,00:14:53,00:14:54,which...
270,00:14:55,00:14:57,...apparently continued.
271,00:14:59,00:15:04,"A virus hunter becomes the virus-hunted, years after the job is left behind."
272,00:15:04,00:15:06,So how did his old prey catch up with him?
273,00:15:06,00:15:09,Ibare has never been discovered in the U.S.
274,00:15:09,00:15:12,Weaver's passport records don't show any recent international travel.
275,00:15:12,00:15:17,The only specimens of the virus within a thousand miles were the ones in RyneLab's freezers.
276,00:15:17,00:15:19,All of which have been inventoried and accounted for.
277,00:15:19,00:15:21,None went missing.
278,00:15:21,00:15:25,Wait a minute. You're saying that this company keeps a stockpile of this virus here in Nevada?
279,00:15:25,00:15:27,That's exactly what I'm saying.
280,00:15:27,00:15:30,"With the Defense Department's blessing, of course, and generous funding."
281,00:15:30,00:15:30,Why?
282,00:15:30,00:15:33,Military can't use biological weapons like that.
283,00:15:33,00:15:33,Exactly.
284,00:15:33,00:15:46,"Which is why the program goes under the heading ""Bio-Defense."" See, this company cultivates and studies these organisms to prepare for the awfulpossibility that one day they may wind up on U.S. soil."
285,00:15:46,00:15:48,BRODY: Hey.
286,00:15:48,00:15:51,Police records popped something on Jack Weaver.
287,00:15:51,00:15:54,Field investigation card from last week.
288,00:15:54,00:15:58,Officer responded to a street where Weaver was drunk and prophesizing about a plague.
289,00:15:58,00:16:00,Plague! The world is bleeding!
290,00:16:00,00:16:02,(siren whoops)
291,00:16:02,00:16:04,Cop just told him to move on.
292,00:16:04,00:16:06,"And a week later his prophecy came true, at least for him."
293,00:16:06,00:16:08,"Well, let's not forget, now, he was shot."
294,00:16:08,00:16:12,I can't help but believe that this shooting and the infection are related in some way.
295,00:16:12,00:16:13,What are you thinking?
296,00:16:13,00:16:17,"Weaver was broke and bitter, but he still knew a lot about deadly pathogens."
297,00:16:17,00:16:19,May have even had access to one of those connections.
298,00:16:19,00:16:22,Maybe making him the perfect wingman for a bioterrorist.
299,00:16:22,00:16:23,Exactly.
300,00:16:23,00:16:27,"Yeah, but the only terror so far happened to Weaver himself."
301,00:16:27,00:16:29,"So, something goes awry with the plan."
302,00:16:29,00:16:30,Second thoughts.
303,00:16:30,00:16:32,Sloppy execution.
304,00:16:32,00:16:34,Weaver ends up infected.
305,00:16:34,00:16:35,Coconspirator shoots him to silence him.
306,00:16:35,00:16:40,And that same person makes off with the viral ammo.
307,00:16:40,00:16:41,I saw something in the photos.
308,00:16:41,00:16:43,I wasn't sure what it was. I think I do now.
309,00:16:43,00:16:45,Here.
310,00:16:45,00:16:47,The void in the blood.
311,00:16:47,00:16:48,It's rectangular.
312,00:16:48,00:16:49,It's got round corners.
313,00:16:49,00:16:51,Could very easily be a briefcase.
314,00:16:51,00:16:54,BRODY: The kind you might use to transport a deadly pathogen.
315,00:16:56,00:16:58,"Conrad, we need to get in that house ASAP."
316,00:16:58,00:17:00,No.
317,00:17:00,00:17:02,CDC is saying it's not safe yet.
318,00:17:02,00:17:06,"Yeah, but it's safer than leaving a killer and a deadly virus on the street."
319,00:17:07,00:17:09,"Well, you put it that way..."
320,00:17:09,00:17:10,(phone beeping)
321,00:17:10,00:17:13,I'll get you in there.
322,00:17:13,00:17:17,"BRODY: The UV light and formaldehyde nuked all biologicals, so there's no DNA."
323,00:17:17,00:17:19,And no virus.
324,00:17:19,00:17:20,STOKES: Everything's just how they left it.
325,00:17:22,00:17:24,Lead would still survive.
326,00:17:27,00:17:28,"Gunshot was a through-and-through, right?"
327,00:17:28,00:17:31,Yeah. So there should still be a bullet here.
328,00:17:31,00:17:32,Okay. Let's go to work.
329,00:17:32,00:17:34,Body was right here.
330,00:17:36,00:17:40,"Robbins' report said that the bullet was ricocheted into the vic, right?"
331,00:17:40,00:17:42,"Right. Well, there's a..."
332,00:17:42,00:17:45,there's a bullet skip mark here on the floor.
333,00:17:45,00:17:46,Impacted at a low angle.
334,00:17:46,00:17:49,For Weaver to get shot in the neck means...
335,00:17:49,00:17:50,he must have been laying down.
336,00:17:50,00:17:53,Yeah.
337,00:17:53,00:17:55,STOKES: Which means the bullet would have to stay low.
338,00:18:00,00:18:02,Oh... Morgan.
339,00:18:02,00:18:03,I think I've got something.
340,00:18:06,00:18:08,I just found the bullet.
341,00:18:10,00:18:12,BRODY: Greg marked the case right here by the door.
342,00:18:12,00:18:17,"Killer would have needed some distance to account for the low-angle bullet skip, so..."
343,00:18:19,00:18:20,Shooter stands here...
344,00:18:23,00:18:25,"Fires at Weaver, who's prone, sick on the ground."
345,00:18:27,00:18:29,Takes off with the briefcase.
346,00:18:29,00:18:31,And whatever lurks inside of it.
347,00:18:32,00:18:34,That works.
348,00:18:37,00:18:39,"Clock is ticking, Sara."
349,00:18:43,00:18:44,It's your move.
350,00:18:46,00:18:48,What if it is starting?
351,00:18:48,00:18:50,An epidemic.
352,00:18:50,00:18:53,What if yesterday was the last normal day?
353,00:18:56,00:19:01,What happened to the optimist who used to share this fishbowl?
354,00:19:02,00:19:04,I'm just thinking.
355,00:19:04,00:19:08,You know how quickly everything could change.
356,00:19:08,00:19:09,You have a headache or a fever.
357,00:19:09,00:19:12,You think it's just a day off of work.
358,00:19:12,00:19:13,Instead...
359,00:19:13,00:19:14,You're booking a trip to Costa Rica.
360,00:19:14,00:19:18,"'Cause when we're cleared from here, something good's gonna happen."
361,00:19:20,00:19:22,Motivation for a vacation.
362,00:19:23,00:19:26,Is that really what it takes?
363,00:19:26,00:19:30,Something like this?
364,00:19:30,00:19:32,To do the things you've been putting off.
365,00:19:37,00:19:39,I'll take reminders where we can get them.
366,00:19:44,00:19:48,Hmm. Booking your own tropical vacation?
367,00:19:48,00:19:49,Not exactly.
368,00:19:52,00:19:53,WOMAN: Greg?
369,00:19:53,00:19:54,"Hi, Grandma."
370,00:19:54,00:19:55,How have you been?
371,00:19:55,00:19:57,Good.
372,00:19:57,00:19:58,So nice of you to check in on me.
373,00:19:58,00:19:59,How are you?
374,00:19:59,00:20:02,"I, uh..."
375,00:20:02,00:20:04,It's been an interesting day.
376,00:20:04,00:20:05,Looks sunny there.
377,00:20:05,00:20:07,It's been nice all morning.
378,00:20:07,00:20:09,The garden looks great.
379,00:20:09,00:20:13,"Yeah? Well, that's actually why I was calling."
380,00:20:13,00:20:17,Thinking about coming up there to see you and check it out.
381,00:20:17,00:20:19,"Oh, Greg, I would love that."
382,00:20:19,00:20:22,"Me, too."
383,00:20:22,00:20:24,RUSSELL: Heard you found a match on the bullet that killed Weaver.
384,00:20:24,00:20:27,Yep. A recovered round from a gas station holdup six months ago.
385,00:20:27,00:20:32,"Case wasn't solved, but we did have a very strong suspect."
386,00:20:32,00:20:35,Northtown nuisance Shawn Steubens.
387,00:20:35,00:20:38,"Priors for weapons violations, robbery."
388,00:20:38,00:20:40,Doesn't look like a bioterrorist.
389,00:20:40,00:20:42,Agreed.
390,00:20:42,00:20:43,Let's get him to prove us wrong.
391,00:20:49,00:20:50,Shawn Steubens.
392,00:20:50,00:20:52,LVPD.
393,00:20:52,00:20:53,Open up.
394,00:20:54,00:20:55,Shawn!
395,00:20:55,00:20:58,It's very important that we talk to you!
396,00:20:59,00:21:03,(faint groaning from inside)
397,00:21:06,00:21:09,(faint groaning from inside)
398,00:21:24,00:21:26,STOKES: This guy's infected.
399,00:21:40,00:21:42,Tell me that's the cure.
400,00:21:42,00:21:43,It's for your pain.
401,00:21:45,00:21:46,And then what?
402,00:21:53,00:21:55,You want to tell me what happened?
403,00:21:58,00:22:03,"Shawn, what's happening to you may be happening to other people."
404,00:22:05,00:22:06,It may be happening to...
405,00:22:08,00:22:13,...two friends of mine that I care about very much.
406,00:22:18,00:22:21,Shawn...
407,00:22:21,00:22:22,"I'm begging you, man."
408,00:22:22,00:22:24,Help us out here.
409,00:22:27,00:22:30,"Driving around the other night, late..."
410,00:22:31,00:22:36,"...saw someone go into that house, wearing a big rubber suit like the guys who brought me here."
411,00:22:36,00:22:38,A Hazmat suit?
412,00:22:38,00:22:39,Going in Jack Weaver's house?
413,00:22:39,00:22:40,Yeah.
414,00:22:40,00:22:43,"That suit, that part of town, I..."
415,00:22:43,00:22:46,figured they had a meth cook going on inside.
416,00:22:46,00:22:49,"Then what'd you do, Shawn?"
417,00:22:49,00:22:51,Grabbed my nine-mil.
418,00:22:51,00:22:54,Went in to rip the place off.
419,00:22:54,00:22:57,Saw what was really inside.
420,00:22:57,00:22:59,Briefcase looked important.
421,00:22:59,00:23:01,So I grabbed it.
422,00:23:01,00:23:04,I figured maybe it was stuffed with cash.
423,00:23:04,00:23:07,Then that suit was coming at me.
424,00:23:07,00:23:08,I panicked.
425,00:23:11,00:23:13,Shooting that guy was an accident. I swear.
426,00:23:17,00:23:19,You didn't get a good look...
427,00:23:19,00:23:21,"at who was in that Hazmat suit, did you?"
428,00:23:21,00:23:23,"No face, no eyes."
429,00:23:23,00:23:25,"And the briefcase, what happened to that?"
430,00:23:25,00:23:28,It's at my house.
431,00:23:28,00:23:30,Spent a little while trying to bust it open.
432,00:23:30,00:23:36,"Kind of lost interest in the briefcase when, you know, my eyes started bleeding."
433,00:23:40,00:23:44,"Well, I'm... I'm gonna leave you to it."
434,00:23:49,00:23:56,Amateur video from the scene shows CDC vehicles and personnel at the North Las Vegas residence.
435,00:23:56,00:24:02,"Officials have not released details of what drew this emergency response, but sources report that..."
436,00:24:02,00:24:03,The story's still under wraps.
437,00:24:03,00:24:05,At least nobody's panicking.
438,00:24:05,00:24:08,"Additionally, it's reported that two veteran Crime Scene Investigators were..."
439,00:24:08,00:24:10,"Did she just call us ""veteran""?"
440,00:24:10,00:24:13,'Cause now I might panic.
441,00:24:13,00:24:16,I can turn this off if it's bugging you.
442,00:24:16,00:24:19,"No. No, no, it's fine."
443,00:24:19,00:24:21,...spokesperson isn't releasing any information on their condition at this time.
444,00:24:21,00:24:26,Desert Palm and other local hospitals declined to comment when asked if they had recently...
445,00:24:26,00:24:30,Sara? Are you...?
446,00:24:30,00:24:33,Sara! Sara!
447,00:24:35,00:24:36,We need a doctor!
448,00:24:36,00:24:37,Sara!
449,00:24:37,00:24:38,Somebody!
450,00:24:38,00:24:40,"Somebody, please help!"
451,00:24:42,00:24:45,Sara! Sara!
452,00:24:46,00:24:47,(muffled): Sara!
453,00:24:55,00:24:56,"SANDERS: Hey, Russell."
454,00:24:56,00:24:59,RUSSELL: Hi.
455,00:24:59,00:25:01,They said that you have a...
456,00:25:01,00:25:04,100.4... fever.
457,00:25:04,00:25:11,"But her viral antibody tests are still negative, so it could just be a common bug or the stress of all this or..."
458,00:25:15,00:25:16,I'm so sorry.
459,00:25:16,00:25:19,They wouldn't let me come any sooner.
460,00:25:19,00:25:22,We know.
461,00:25:25,00:25:30,"Russell, I need you to do something for me."
462,00:25:30,00:25:31,"Yeah, of course. Anything."
463,00:25:35,00:25:40,"If we're gonna die, we need to go out fighting, okay?"
464,00:25:40,00:25:42,"So, put us to work."
465,00:25:45,00:25:48,Neither one of you have my permission to die.
466,00:25:50,00:25:52,You got that?
467,00:25:55,00:25:57,All right. Uh...
468,00:25:57,00:26:00,Morgan recovered the stolen briefcase.
469,00:26:00,00:26:03,The only thing in it was Jack Weaver's computer.
470,00:26:03,00:26:05,She'll upload his hard drive.
471,00:26:05,00:26:06,She'll get it to you guys.
472,00:26:06,00:26:08,"Yeah, we'll start digging."
473,00:26:41,00:26:44,"RUSSELL: So, you found anything interesting yet?"
474,00:26:44,00:26:49,"Well, Jack Weaver was obsessed with the Ibare virus long before he was infected with it."
475,00:26:49,00:26:54,"His Web histories, cached articles, all dwell on that particular pathogen."
476,00:26:54,00:26:57,SIDLE: Especially one outbreak of it in 2006.
477,00:26:57,00:27:00,The disease tore through a village in Bolivia called Campiza.
478,00:27:00,00:27:02,We know why this was Jack's focus?
479,00:27:02,00:27:05,He did witness the carnage firsthand.
480,00:27:05,00:27:11,He and Heather Lanning were sent to the village to study the outbreak and help with the infected.
481,00:27:11,00:27:17,"Yeah, but Weaver did fieldwork at a lot of those outbreaks which is why he burned out, according to Lanning."
482,00:27:17,00:27:19,Wha-What makes that one different?
483,00:27:19,00:27:24,"Yeah, we're not sure yet, though, speaking of Lanning, Weaver had been e-mailing with her right up to a week ago."
484,00:27:24,00:27:26,She told me that she hadn't spoken to him for years.
485,00:27:26,00:27:30,Weaver was sending her ramblingmessages saying that they had to talk about Bolivia.
486,00:27:30,00:27:32,Lanning shut him down.
487,00:27:32,00:27:34,"""Jack, you're a troubled man."
488,00:27:34,00:27:38,"You need help. You need to move on."" That was five days before we found him dead."
489,00:27:38,00:27:42,"RUSSELL: Okay, now, Lanning said she didn't recognize Weaver's body, and I let that slide."
490,00:27:42,00:27:44,But obviously she's hiding something.
491,00:27:44,00:27:45,MAN: Mr. Russell?
492,00:27:49,00:27:50,Yeah. My name is Rudy Adela.
493,00:27:50,00:27:52,We met earlier.
494,00:27:52,00:27:53,"Yeah, you're the attorney for RyneLab, right?"
495,00:27:53,00:27:57,I was informed by our research tech at RyneLab of a missing agent.
496,00:27:57,00:27:59,A vial of the Ibare virus.
497,00:28:03,00:28:05,You got something there?
498,00:28:07,00:28:10,"I, uh, asked Dr. Lanning about it."
499,00:28:13,00:28:15,"(click, beep)"
500,00:28:15,00:28:16,"LANNING: Rudy, the loss cannot be reported."
501,00:28:16,00:28:18,ADELA: We can't just ignore it.
502,00:28:18,00:28:21,LANNING: You don't say a word to anyone.
503,00:28:21,00:28:24,How much was in that vial? It's ten cc's.
504,00:28:24,00:28:27,20 million virion particles.
505,00:28:29,00:28:31,And each one a potential death sentence.
506,00:28:36,00:28:42,"Your company lost a potential weapon of mass destruction, and then you covered it up, at the very least."
507,00:28:42,00:28:45,What are you accusing me of?
508,00:28:45,00:28:46,I'm here without an attorney.
509,00:28:46,00:28:48,Doesn't that tell you something about my...
510,00:28:48,00:28:52,"Tells me something about your attorney's conscience, actually."
511,00:28:52,00:28:56,"Now, contrary to what you told us, you were in contact with Jack Weaver."
512,00:28:56,00:28:57,These are the e-mails.
513,00:28:57,00:28:59,He wanted to talk to you about Bolivia.
514,00:28:59,00:29:01,I told you he wasn't stable.
515,00:29:01,00:29:02,He needed help.
516,00:29:02,00:29:08,"Ms. Lanning, we're working with the CDC now, under a federal order."
517,00:29:08,00:29:11,"As we speak, we're tearing apart your offices."
518,00:29:11,00:29:13,"Every file, every hard drive."
519,00:29:13,00:29:16,And we just got this in from your building surveillance.
520,00:29:16,00:29:22,"That's you walking Jack Weaver into the facility, after hours, a week before he died."
521,00:29:22,00:29:26,"I thought bringing him there, talking, might remind him of all the good work he did."
522,00:29:26,00:29:28,"No, that's not true."
523,00:29:28,00:29:29,"Once again, these are the e-mails."
524,00:29:29,00:29:31,He demanded to meet you there.
525,00:29:31,00:29:35,"And because you went along with it, I'm guessing he had some sort of leverage."
526,00:29:35,00:29:37,He had my pity.
527,00:29:37,00:29:39,I was trying to help him.
528,00:29:39,00:29:45,"Ms. Lanning, a man who's obsessed with the Ibare virus visits the lab."
529,00:29:45,00:29:47,A vial of that virus goes missing.
530,00:29:47,00:29:50,And that same pathogen kills him within days.
531,00:29:50,00:29:52,You think he...
532,00:29:52,00:29:54,No.
533,00:29:54,00:29:56,I didn't let him near anywhere near the specimen storage.
534,00:29:56,00:29:59,"So, he was never out of your sight, even for a moment?"
535,00:29:59,00:30:01,Maybe for... two minutes.
536,00:30:01,00:30:03,"He went to use the men's room, but..."
537,00:30:03,00:30:04,"Uh-huh, yeah."
538,00:30:04,00:30:06,That man had worked in that building for years.
539,00:30:06,00:30:08,He knew how to access the specimens.
540,00:30:08,00:30:10,He could have gotten in and out of there in two minutes.
541,00:30:10,00:30:12,And you know it.
542,00:30:14,00:30:16,Here's what I think.
543,00:30:16,00:30:21,"I believe that you realized your mistake, so you went to his home."
544,00:30:21,00:30:24,You wanted to keep track of Jack and the missing vial.
545,00:30:24,00:30:25,Kind of damage control.
546,00:30:25,00:30:26,No! That's not...
547,00:30:26,00:30:31,"By the time you got there, Jack Weaver had already infected himself."
548,00:30:31,00:30:32,And what?
549,00:30:32,00:30:34,I just let him die?
550,00:30:34,00:30:35,"That's what I think, yeah."
551,00:30:35,00:30:40,I think you realized that if your mistake came out that your labs would be shut down.
552,00:30:40,00:30:42,So you watched him crash and bleed out.
553,00:30:42,00:30:47,"And then you were gonna dispose of his body, but someone came along and ruined your plan."
554,00:30:51,00:30:52,So you panicked...
555,00:30:52,00:30:57,and you left behind the body and the blood for my CSIs to walk into.
556,00:30:59,00:31:01,I'm done talking about it.
557,00:31:01,00:31:02,I want an attorney.
558,00:31:02,00:31:03,Good idea.
559,00:31:04,00:31:09,"Russell spins a hell of a theory, but we still don't know why Weaver took the vial or how he ended up infected."
560,00:31:09,00:31:12,I think infecting himself with that virus was the whole point.
561,00:31:12,00:31:14,"Conrad, he knew the dangers."
562,00:31:14,00:31:15,This was no accident.
563,00:31:15,00:31:16,What do you mean?
564,00:31:16,00:31:20,"I'm saying that Weaver knew something about RyneLab, something major."
565,00:31:20,00:31:24,"What? I don't know yet, but he hints about it in his e-mails."
566,00:31:24,00:31:28,I think exposing himself to this virus was his way of exposing that whole company.
567,00:31:28,00:31:29,"All right, so he got our attention."
568,00:31:29,00:31:31,What did he want us to know?
569,00:31:31,00:31:37,"Morgan and I are going over the files right now, but my gut tells me '06 Bolivian outbreak seems to have been his obsession."
570,00:31:37,00:31:40,"Well, let's make it our obsession-- and quickly."
571,00:31:40,00:31:42,RyneLab's got a lot of juice in DC.
572,00:31:42,00:31:44,Our investigation could get shut down any minute.
573,00:31:44,00:31:45,I'm on it.
574,00:31:51,00:31:53,STOKES: Hey.
575,00:31:54,00:31:57,Reports all tell the same tale.
576,00:31:57,00:32:05,"Lanning and Weaver arrived at the Bolivian village two days after the first infections were reported, identified the pathogen as Ibare."
577,00:32:05,00:32:07,"Yeah, they treated and contained the sick in a field hospital."
578,00:32:07,00:32:09,"20 infected, 17 dead."
579,00:32:09,00:32:12,Then the virus just ran its course.
580,00:32:12,00:32:14,"Her field reports, her journals, they're all consistent."
581,00:32:14,00:32:17,"So, what are we missing?"
582,00:32:35,00:32:37,What is it?
583,00:32:37,00:32:39,It was collected from Lanning's desk at RyneLab.
584,00:32:39,00:32:41,What is that?
585,00:32:41,00:32:45,"It's from Bolivia, to Heather's home address here."
586,00:32:45,00:32:47,Postmarked...
587,00:32:47,00:32:48,around the end of the outbreak.
588,00:32:51,00:32:54,It's a letter from Heather to herself.
589,00:32:54,00:32:56,Why would somebody do something like that?
590,00:32:58,00:32:59,Because she couldn't tell anybody else.
591,00:32:59,00:33:01,Read it.
592,00:33:01,00:33:07,"""Let the reports and lab records tally ""the dead and the lucky."
593,00:33:07,00:33:12,"""But for my own sanity, I need to put down what I saw."
594,00:33:12,00:33:14,"""To remember that it happened."
595,00:33:14,00:33:21,"So that it never happens again."" It's not our call, Jack."
596,00:33:21,00:33:22,The directive for RyneLab was clear.
597,00:33:22,00:33:24,Yeah. Lie to them.
598,00:33:24,00:33:27,Tell these people their family members aren't dying in there.
599,00:33:27,00:33:30,We don't have the manpower to deal with a panic.
600,00:33:30,00:33:32,We need to maintain the quarantine.
601,00:33:32,00:33:33,MAN: What is happening in there?
602,00:33:35,00:33:37,(villagers speaking Spanish)
603,00:33:40,00:33:42,You tell us nothing.
604,00:33:47,00:33:48,It's a fever.
605,00:33:48,00:33:50,It's just a fever.
606,00:33:50,00:33:52,They're gonna be fine.
607,00:33:52,00:33:54,Fever?
608,00:33:54,00:33:57,(translating in Spanish)
609,00:33:57,00:34:00,Then we will care for them at home.
610,00:34:00,00:34:03,No. You can't go in.
611,00:34:03,00:34:04,We need to treat them here. (speaking Spanish)
612,00:34:04,00:34:06,Stop!
613,00:34:07,00:34:08,Please... don't touch them! Wait.
614,00:34:08,00:34:15,"BRODY: ""The official reports ""will simply show ""a spike of 15 new infections, ""12 of them fatal."
615,00:34:15,00:34:18,"""But Jack and I know the truth ""about the numbers."
616,00:34:20,00:34:28,"And we will have to live with it."" Well, it sounds like she figured out how to live with it, but he didn't."
617,00:34:28,00:34:30,"Well, suicide wasn't enough."
618,00:34:30,00:34:31,It's too easy.
619,00:34:31,00:34:35,"No, he infected himself because he wanted to empathize with these victims."
620,00:34:35,00:34:37,To feel the pain his lie caused.
621,00:34:37,00:34:39,We have to prove it.
622,00:34:39,00:34:43,We have to prove that he stole the virus from RyneLab's facility.
623,00:34:55,00:34:56,Any luck?
624,00:34:56,00:35:00,"One tiny partial print-- it won't be any help, except to tell us that..."
625,00:35:00,00:35:02,somebody opened this container without wearing gloves.
626,00:35:02,00:35:05,"Well, the swabs I took didn't find any touch DNA."
627,00:35:05,00:35:07,"No useable prints, no DNA."
628,00:35:10,00:35:12,There is something else to try.
629,00:35:12,00:35:14,"Morgan, what's unique about this room?"
630,00:35:14,00:35:16,Freezers full of exotic death.
631,00:35:16,00:35:21,"Aside from those contained organisms, there's no life in here, but the room's kept spotless."
632,00:35:21,00:35:25,"Every person who enters, per protocol, is wrapped in rubber."
633,00:35:25,00:35:26,Except for one person who broke protocol.
634,00:35:26,00:35:29,You're thinking microbial forensics.
635,00:35:29,00:35:30,You're familiar with the process?
636,00:35:30,00:35:32,"I-I've read a little bit about it, but..."
637,00:35:32,00:35:34,This is theperfect chance to try it.
638,00:35:34,00:35:39,The only microbes living on that surface would have been contributed by that single ungloved person.
639,00:35:39,00:35:42,Every person has a a unique mix of organisms on their skin.
640,00:35:42,00:35:45,"Some they're born with, some they accumulate."
641,00:35:45,00:35:48,The combination is as singular as a fingerprint or DNA.
642,00:35:48,00:35:54,"Other scenes, there are far too many microbes on every single surface to ever distinguish between contributors, but here..."
643,00:35:54,00:35:57,There's only one contributor: whoever stole the virus.
644,00:35:57,00:35:59,I'll call Russell...
645,00:35:59,00:36:03,"see if we can commandeer RyneLab's equipment, do a microbial analysis."
646,00:36:44,00:36:54,"So, I cultured the microbial population from the swab... I spread it over various agars, each formulated to breed particular organisms if they're present."
647,00:36:54,00:36:59,Each positive I.D. we get of a species gets us one step closer to a microbial profile.
648,00:36:59,00:37:00,And our suspect.
649,00:37:00,00:37:02,Yeah. (phone chimes)
650,00:37:04,00:37:06,"Hey, Nick. What's up?"
651,00:37:06,00:37:10,"I was going over the Bolivia files with Russell, you know, explaining everything."
652,00:37:10,00:37:13,Yeah? We noticed something in one of the photos of the village.
653,00:37:13,00:37:15,What?
654,00:37:15,00:37:16,Prepare to have your stomach drop.
655,00:37:18,00:37:20,Eight years ago...
656,00:37:20,00:37:22,half a world away...
657,00:37:22,00:37:23,(sighs)
658,00:37:23,00:37:24,...but...
659,00:37:24,00:37:26,that's you.
660,00:37:28,00:37:31,I haven't seen this photo.
661,00:37:31,00:37:32,But I remember everything.
662,00:37:32,00:37:35,"Your family were among those who were infected in the village, right?"
663,00:37:35,00:37:38,Both of my parents...
664,00:37:38,00:37:40,my sister...
665,00:37:40,00:37:42,all killed.
666,00:37:42,00:37:44,"I was, um..."
667,00:37:44,00:37:45,theluckyone.
668,00:37:48,00:37:53,Can't be a coincidence that you're working for RyneLab now.
669,00:37:53,00:37:57,Same organization that handled the outbreak all those years ago.
670,00:37:57,00:37:59,The company looked out for us.
671,00:37:59,00:38:01,The kids left behind.
672,00:38:01,00:38:03,"Oh, I heard that. I heard that they..."
673,00:38:03,00:38:05,"they sent you to school in La Paz, right?"
674,00:38:05,00:38:06,They...
675,00:38:06,00:38:08,paid for your college?
676,00:38:09,00:38:11,I wanted to work for them.
677,00:38:11,00:38:14,Help study monsters like Ibare.
678,00:38:14,00:38:19,"Turns out I didn't have a mind for science, but a law degree got me in the door."
679,00:38:20,00:38:22,Rudy...
680,00:38:22,00:38:25,we know you found out what happened in your village.
681,00:38:25,00:38:27,"I mean, the real story."
682,00:38:27,00:38:33,"We took your fingerprints off of Heather Lanning's letter, which you found hidden in her office."
683,00:38:33,00:38:37,"I heard rumors back then that RyneLab had caused the deaths, so..."
684,00:38:37,00:38:39,I used my access to get answers.
685,00:38:39,00:38:45,"And when you got your answers and you found out that Jack Weaver was responsible, you wanted revenge."
686,00:38:45,00:38:46,I understand.
687,00:38:48,00:38:50,Okay. Rudy...
688,00:38:50,00:38:58,my CSIs have developed a microbial profile of the hand that... that opened the refrigeration unit and stole the vial of Ibare.
689,00:38:58,00:39:04,A zoo of different organisms all living in harmony on a... on a fingertip.
690,00:39:04,00:39:09,And that same unique combination of life was found on this-- your recorder.
691,00:39:11,00:39:14,"You stole the vial, Rudy."
692,00:39:14,00:39:16,And you infected Jack Weaver.
693,00:39:19,00:39:22,My entire family.
694,00:39:24,00:39:25,They didn't deserve it.
695,00:39:27,00:39:28,He did.
696,00:39:34,00:39:36,"(gasps, grunts)"
697,00:39:39,00:39:42,I stayed there.
698,00:39:42,00:39:44,I watched him suffer.
699,00:39:44,00:39:46,Then I watched the company lie to you.
700,00:39:46,00:39:48,Distance themselves.
701,00:39:48,00:39:50,Cover up.
702,00:39:50,00:39:52,Just like they did allthose years ago.
703,00:39:52,00:39:55,Which is why you recorded Dr. Lanning.
704,00:39:55,00:40:04,"You wanted to bring down the whole company, so they couldn't toy with any more viruses, breed any more monsters."
705,00:40:04,00:40:06,I...
706,00:40:06,00:40:08,would be the last.
707,00:40:33,00:40:35,Sara?
708,00:40:37,00:40:38,Are you...? I'm fine.
709,00:40:38,00:40:40,Dr. Emmett said that I could tell you the news.
710,00:40:40,00:40:46,"No sign of infection, and tests are showing that the virus dies within two hours of exposure to air."
711,00:40:50,00:40:53,Weaver's house wouldn't have been infectious when we entered.
712,00:40:53,00:40:54,No.
713,00:40:54,00:40:57,"CDC's gonna keep an area watch, but there haven't been any other infections."
714,00:40:57,00:40:58,We're clear.
715,00:40:58,00:41:00,(sighs)
716,00:41:00,00:41:01,We're free to go.
717,00:41:01,00:41:03,(gasps in disbelief)
718,00:41:08,00:41:10,(sighs)
719,00:41:10,00:41:12,What are we waiting for?
720,00:41:14,00:41:15,I'm starving.
721,00:41:15,00:41:17,"Me, too. Breakfast?"
722,00:41:17,00:41:18,Coffee.
723,00:41:18,00:41:20,Yeah.
724,00:41:20,00:41:22,Yeah.
725,00:41:28,00:41:30,"Hey, Dave."
726,00:41:30,00:41:31,I spoke with your doctor.
727,00:41:31,00:41:32,You're both okay.
728,00:41:34,00:41:36,"Uh, we were about to grab a bite to eat."
729,00:41:36,00:41:37,Want to join us?
730,00:41:37,00:41:39,I'd love to...
731,00:41:39,00:41:41,but I'm actually here for work.
732,00:41:41,00:41:45,"Shawn Steubens, the kid who got infected..."
733,00:41:45,00:41:46,He didn't make it.
734,00:41:46,00:41:47,PHILLIPS: He wasn't so lucky.
735,00:41:47,00:41:49,It goes without saying...
736,00:41:49,00:41:53,but I'm just really glad you're both okay.
737,00:42:00,00:42:02,Goes without saying.
738,00:42:02,00:42:03,Yeah.
