0	00:00:09	00:00:11	Foxtrot 1-5-Tango, L.A. Center.
1	00:00:11	00:00:12	Please clarify your situation.
2	00:00:16	00:00:20	Foxtrot 1-5-Tango, do you copy?
3	00:00:20	00:00:23	Foxtrot 1-5-Tango, please respond.
4	00:00:23	00:00:26	Hey, Gil, just wanted to hear your voice.
5	00:00:26	00:00:28	It's kind of a slow night here.
6	00:00:28	00:00:30	Give me a call if you get a chance.
7	00:00:30	00:00:32	Las Vegas Approach, L.A. Center.
8	00:00:32	00:00:34	Be advised you have inbound traffic.
9	00:00:34	00:00:36	They are not responding.
10	00:00:36	00:00:37	Roger that, L.A. Center.
11	00:00:37	00:00:38	I've got him on radar.
12	00:00:38	00:00:41	Do you have any idea of his intent?
13	00:00:41	00:00:43	He radioed an emergency, said he was inbound.
14	00:00:43	00:00:46	No contact for almost 12 minutes.
15	00:00:46	00:00:49	Foxtrot 1-5-Tango, this is Las Vegas Approach.
16	00:00:49	00:00:51	Low-altitude alert. Climb immediately.
17	00:00:51	00:00:53	Repeat, climb immediately.
18	00:01:15	00:01:21	It's crazy! All these lights--no wonder you can see this place from space.
19	00:01:21	00:01:23	Oh, my God! Did you see that?
20	00:01:25	00:01:31	This was shot about 40 minutes ago, right before a charter aircraft nosed into the ground at Tresser Park.
21	00:01:31	00:01:32	That's just a mile off the Strip.
22	00:01:32	00:01:35	This is NTSB investigator Doug Wilson.
23	00:01:35	00:01:37	He's gonna be leading the crash investigation.
24	00:01:37	00:01:39	You-you two guys worked together before, right?
25	00:01:39	00:01:41	Yeah. Yeah.
26	00:01:41	00:01:44	On an NTSB crash scene when I worked at the San Francisco Crime Lab.
27	00:01:44	00:01:47	Right now, we have very little information.
28	00:01:47	00:01:48	Where did the flight originate?
29	00:01:48	00:01:50	LV Regional Airport, heading for Chicago.
30	00:01:50	00:01:59	18 minutes out, the pilot reported an unspecified emergency, turned the plane around, From the moment it turned around, made a beeline for the Strip.
31	00:01:59	00:02:05	And almost, as you just saw, slammed into the Mediterranean Casino Tower, missing it by about half a dozen feet.
32	00:02:05	00:02:07	So you're thinking this wasn't an accident?
33	00:02:07	00:02:08	I'm not sure.
34	00:02:08	00:02:17	But it's certainly a mystery why the pilot stopped communicating with the tower, why the plane nose-dived near the Strip, what happened on that plane.
35	00:02:17	00:02:19	All questions we need answers to.
36	00:02:19	00:02:23	Answers we're hoping you CSIs can provide through evidence.
37	00:02:23	00:02:25	So, was it an accident or foul play?
38	00:02:25	00:02:27	This is what we need to find out.
39	00:03:01	00:03:04	Vegas Approach, Foxtrot 1-5-Tango.
40	00:03:04	00:03:05	Got a situation here.
41	00:03:05	00:03:07	Requesting permission for immediate return.
42	00:03:07	00:03:10	Boy, it's not a lot to go on for a distress call.
43	00:03:10	00:03:14	That's what I thought, until I enhanced the audio.
44	00:03:14	00:03:16	Vegas Approach, Foxtrot 1-5-Tango.
45	00:03:16	00:03:17	Got a situation here.
46	00:03:17	00:03:19	Requesting permission for immediate return.
47	00:03:19	00:03:21	Hey, where the hell are you...?
48	00:03:21	00:03:22	There's another voice in the cockpit.
49	00:03:22	00:03:24	Yeah.
50	00:03:24	00:03:27	Could be a hijacker. So far, we've only found one body in the cockpit wreckage.
51	00:03:27	00:03:29	It's got to be the pilot.
52	00:03:29	00:03:32	Keith Mannheim, co-owner of LVM Charter.
53	00:03:32	00:03:34	Well, we also found additional remains.
54	00:03:34	00:03:36	How many bodies? Can't say.
55	00:03:36	00:03:40	With a charter plane this size, there's no requirement for a passenger manifest.
56	00:03:40	00:03:44	As for how many were on the aircraft and who, well, we're gonna need your help with that.
57	00:03:44	00:03:47	NTSB has secured the crash site, right?
58	00:03:47	00:03:50	Nick and David Phillips are coordinating the recovery of human remains.
59	00:03:50	00:03:52	They're already on scene.
60	00:03:52	00:03:55	Morgan and Greg are heading out to collect personal effects.
61	00:03:55	00:03:57	Could help with identifications. Right.
62	00:03:57	00:03:59	What about the black box? Still haven't recovered it.
63	00:03:59	00:04:03	Was about to head back to the site; could use some help.
64	00:04:03	00:04:06	Two of you have worked together before--you probably have your own shorthand. It's a good idea.
65	00:04:06	00:04:08	All right, let's get to work.
66	00:04:08	00:04:09	Lot of eyes on this.
67	00:04:09	00:04:11	We need answers.
68	00:04:11	00:04:13	You know, I think I should drive this time.
69	00:04:13	00:04:15	Thank you.
70	00:04:15	00:04:17	Oh, 'cause you're scared of going more than 20 miles per hour?
71	00:04:17	00:04:20	Hojem-Sanders! I was hoping I'd see you!
72	00:04:20	00:04:22	Hey, Donna.
73	00:04:22	00:04:24	What are you doing here? Are you looking for me?
74	00:04:24	00:04:25	Me, actually.
75	00:04:25	00:04:28	Which means you must be Morgan Brody.
76	00:04:28	00:04:32	Yes. Hi. I am so sorry. We just got a call out, and I completely forgot about our appointment.
77	00:04:32	00:04:33	Appointment?
78	00:04:33	00:04:34	How do you two...?
79	00:04:34	00:04:36	Doc Robbins recommended Donna.
80	00:04:36	00:04:38	He was blown away by your genealogy work on his family.
81	00:04:38	00:04:41	You said on the phone that you had some family history for me?
82	00:04:41	00:04:43	I did, and it's on my desk.
83	00:04:43	00:04:46	But... I'm so sorry, we have to get to a crime scene.
84	00:04:46	00:04:50	Oh, that's all right. You go do what you have to do, and I'll work here.
85	00:04:50	00:04:52	Believe me, there's a lot of Brodys out there.
86	00:04:52	00:04:54	Oh, Brody's actually my stepfather's last name.
87	00:04:54	00:04:55	I'm interested in Ecklie.
88	00:04:55	00:04:57	Oh, your biological father. Of course.
89	00:04:57	00:04:59	Don't tell me.
90	00:04:59	00:05:01	You still trying to prove he's not your dad? (laughs)
91	00:05:01	00:05:03	Uh, just kidding.
92	00:05:03	00:05:09	Christmas is coming, and I want to get my dad something special, so I thought maybe a family crest.
93	00:05:09	00:05:11	How wonderful. Okay.
94	00:05:11	00:05:12	You go do your thing, and I'll get to work here.
95	00:05:12	00:05:14	Thanks.
96	00:05:18	00:05:20	Ready to roll? Just about.
97	00:05:20	00:05:22	Just like old times, right?
98	00:05:23	00:05:25	Very old times.
99	00:05:25	00:05:26	Heard you, uh, married your boss.
100	00:05:26	00:05:28	What's his name again?
101	00:05:28	00:05:29	Gil.
102	00:05:29	00:05:31	Right. Grissom. Bug guy.
103	00:05:31	00:05:33	You still married to what's-her-name?
104	00:05:33	00:05:36	Candy? Candy, right. Yoga instructor.
105	00:05:36	00:05:39	No, no, we...crashed and burned years ago.
106	00:05:39	00:05:40	Yeah, I didn't see that coming.
107	00:05:40	00:05:42	Yeah, you did.
108	00:05:42	00:05:44	Just like old times.
109	00:05:48	00:05:50	Hey, Doc. How's it going? Hey.
110	00:05:50	00:05:51	What do you got for me?
111	00:05:51	00:05:54	On the left gurney are the remains from the cockpit.
112	00:05:54	00:06:00	In front of me and on the right, remains recovered from the passenger cabin area.
113	00:06:00	00:06:03	And we ran DNA on a small sample of those remains.
114	00:06:03	00:06:10	Turns out we have one Jane and two John Does. So in addition to what I assume is our pilot, we have three unidentified passengers.
115	00:06:14	00:06:16	Looks like I've got something here.
116	00:06:16	00:06:18	Take a look.
117	00:06:18	00:06:20	Looks like a T-10 or T-11 vertebra.
118	00:06:20	00:06:23	What's that? Part of the fuselage?
119	00:06:23	00:06:24	David, hand me that, would you?
120	00:06:24	00:06:26	Yeah.
121	00:06:26	00:06:29	Hmm, looks like shrapnel.
122	00:06:29	00:06:33	Surrounding tissue appears deteriorated-- this guy was in pain.
123	00:06:33	00:06:34	And over a long period of time.
124	00:06:34	00:06:36	Just a second.
125	00:06:40	00:06:42	Radioactive?
126	00:06:42	00:06:43	As I suspected.
127	00:06:43	00:06:48	I think I know how we can identify at least this victim.
128	00:06:58	00:07:00	Dalton Burk?
129	00:07:00	00:07:03	Not a good time right now.
130	00:07:03	00:07:04	We're from the crime lab.
131	00:07:04	00:07:07	We're here investigating the crash.
132	00:07:07	00:07:08	Crime lab? I don't understand.
133	00:07:08	00:07:10	What happened was an accident, right?
134	00:07:10	00:07:12	Well, that's why we're here.
135	00:07:12	00:07:14	There was no passenger manifest filed for the flight, so...
136	00:07:14	00:07:17	'Cause Keith was flying solo--VFR.
137	00:07:17	00:07:19	He doesn't need to; there were no passengers.
138	00:07:19	00:07:23	Well, we found three other bodies in the wreckage.
139	00:07:23	00:07:25	That's impossible-- Keith was alone.
140	00:07:25	00:07:29	Told me he was flying home to visit his folks for a few days in Chicago.
141	00:07:29	00:07:31	I'm sorry, man. I think he told you wrong.
142	00:07:31	00:07:37	Can you explain how three other people might get on your plane without you knowing?
143	00:07:37	00:07:39	Keith and I are business partners.
144	00:07:39	00:07:42	We each focus on different aspects of the company.
145	00:07:42	00:07:47	Normally, I do the booking, but obviously he must've booked some passengers on his own.
146	00:07:47	00:07:49	Why are you asking me all these questions?
147	00:07:49	00:07:51	Is there something you're not telling me?
148	00:07:51	00:07:54	When you say Keith was your business partner, how well did you know him?
149	00:07:57	00:08:01	Well, it's not any of your business, but we were a couple.
150	00:08:01	00:08:03	We were together for the last 15 years.
151	00:08:03	00:08:08	So if it seems like I'm not in the mood to talk right now, you're right.
152	00:08:08	00:08:10	We're really sorry for your loss.
153	00:08:10	00:08:15	We do need to confirm that one of the bodies that we found was indeed Keith's.
154	00:08:15	00:08:25	So, if you could get us a toothbrush, a hairbrush, anything that might have Keith's DNA on it, that'd be great, okay?
155	00:08:25	00:08:26	Yeah, I'll get that to you.
156	00:08:30	00:08:32	Yeah, you're gonna love Donna. She's awesome.
157	00:08:32	00:08:35	She totally got me hooked on genealogy.
158	00:08:35	00:08:36	She seems cool.
159	00:08:36	00:08:38	I found this mixed with the personal effects.
160	00:08:38	00:08:42	Take a look. Looks like a section of airplane carpeting.
161	00:08:42	00:08:44	Yup. Melted around something.
162	00:08:44	00:08:47	Whoa, I got a gun.
163	00:08:47	00:08:48	It could be our hijacker's.
164	00:08:48	00:08:50	Can you hold this open for me?
165	00:08:57	00:08:59	Nine-millimeter Beretta, receiver's torqued.
166	00:08:59	00:09:01	Damage from the fire.
167	00:09:07	00:09:09	Three rounds left in the magazine.
168	00:09:09	00:09:10	Someone could have fired it.
169	00:09:10	00:09:12	And I think we might know who.
170	00:09:12	00:09:16	Shrapnel in one of the victims turned out to contain depleted uranium.
171	00:09:16	00:09:17	You mean, like from a battlefield?
172	00:09:17	00:09:19	So the guy's a vet?
173	00:09:19	00:09:20	Right, and the V.A.
174	00:09:20	00:09:24	had X-rays on file matched to a Charles Harrigan.
175	00:09:24	00:09:28	Made headlines last year, when he got into a fight and got tossed out of the Mediterranean.
176	00:09:28	00:09:34	Yeah, he, uh, gambled away his home, his car, his wife-- he blamed the casino.
177	00:09:34	00:09:37	Camped out in front to keep people from going in.
178	00:09:37	00:09:41	Maybe commandeering an airplane and trying to crash it into the casino was his form of revenge.
179	00:09:41	00:09:45	That's what I'm thinking, so let's run the gun, see if it traces back to Harrigan. All right.
180	00:09:49	00:09:51	Flight data recorder's intact.
181	00:09:51	00:09:53	Wish we had the cockpit voice recorder too.
182	00:09:53	00:09:54	Yeah, join the club.
183	00:09:54	00:09:57	They're not required for smaller charters.
184	00:09:57	00:10:00	Hey, did you hear that the Rusty Nickel closed?
185	00:10:00	00:10:02	(laughs) Well, that's about time.
186	00:10:02	00:10:03	That bar gave dives a bad name.
187	00:10:03	00:10:05	What are you talking about? You loved that place.
188	00:10:05	00:10:09	Well, yeah, you're right, I did love it, right up until the moment that they kicked me out for life. (clears throat)
189	00:10:09	00:10:11	They did do that. Yup.
190	00:10:11	00:10:14	Okay, moving on. So, we have the primary flight display up.
191	00:10:14	00:10:17	It should show us everything on the instrument panel.
192	00:10:17	00:10:25	17 minutes into the flight, airspeed is 250 knots, altitude is 29,800 feet and climbing, heading is 50 degrees-- all normal.
193	00:10:25	00:10:29	Looks like there's a slight decrease in cabin pressure.
194	00:10:29	00:10:35	Pilot's turning around, making a descent, looks like he's putting in vectors to return to the airport.
195	00:10:37	00:10:39	What the hell just happened?
196	00:10:43	00:10:49	Massive depressurization. 30,000 feet, virtually no oxygen, temperature is 34 below.
197	00:10:49	00:10:50	They were dead before they even hit the ground.
198	00:10:50	00:10:52	The plane just kept going.
199	00:10:52	00:10:55	Vector entries kept it on course all the way to the ground.
200	00:10:55	00:10:58	Barely missing the Mediterranean Tower. Mm-hmm.
201	00:10:58	00:10:59	Why the depressurization?
202	00:10:59	00:11:01	Gunshot, maybe.
203	00:11:01	00:11:02	We know there was a gun on board.
204	00:11:02	00:11:05	A bullet hole alone wouldn't trigger that kind of event.
205	00:11:05	00:11:07	This was instantaneous, catastrophic. Like a bomb?
206	00:11:07	00:11:09	Bomb would've taken out the avionics and hydraulics.
207	00:11:09	00:11:11	Plane wouldn't have stayed on course.
208	00:11:11	00:11:12	All right, what's left, then?
209	00:11:12	00:11:15	Uh, maybe a window blew out, or a door.
210	00:11:15	00:11:18	Whatever it is, it had to fall to earth, right?
211	00:11:18	00:11:26	Extrapolating from their position at the time of depressurization and factoring in their altitude and their velocity, I mean, I can zero in on their location.
212	00:11:26	00:11:28	Always the physics major.
213	00:11:28	00:11:32	I tell you what, I'm going to take my physics and I'm going to find whatever fell out of your airplane.
214	00:11:32	00:11:34	And what about me? What do I do?
215	00:11:34	00:11:35	Well, you're going to build me a plane.
216	00:11:59	00:12:02	Well, you found the door.
217	00:12:02	00:12:05	Still don't know what happened. Let's go with our gunshot theory.
218	00:12:05	00:12:06	We're traveling at 30,000 feet.
219	00:12:06	00:12:08	I'm Harrigan.
220	00:12:08	00:12:11	I am going to take over the plane and I'm going to fly it into the Mediterranean.
221	00:12:11	00:12:14	Payback for bankrupting you in one night at the tables.
222	00:12:14	00:12:16	I pull my nine-mil and I start for the cockpit.
223	00:12:16	00:12:18	But one of the other passengers sees you.
224	00:12:18	00:12:20	Jane or John Doe. Tries to overpower you.
225	00:12:20	00:12:22	And we struggle for the gun.
226	00:12:22	00:12:24	We're struggling.
227	00:12:24	00:12:29	In that struggle, the gun goes off, hitting the cabin door.
228	00:12:29	00:12:33	Would explain the initial slow loss of cabin pressure.
229	00:12:34	00:12:36	And then Harrigan breaks free...
230	00:12:37	00:12:39	commandeers the plane.
231	00:12:39	00:12:43	Pilot only has time to radio once and turns the plane around.
232	00:12:45	00:12:47	to return to Vegas on a suicide mission.
233	00:12:47	00:12:51	Yeah, and what he doesn't realize is that the cabin door is already compromised.
234	00:12:51	00:12:52	Bullet must've hit the door somewhere.
235	00:12:54	00:12:55	I'm not seeing anything.
236	00:12:55	00:12:57	No holes, no marks.
237	00:12:57	00:12:58	Must be missing something.
238	00:13:00	00:13:02	Just saying.
239	00:13:02	00:13:05	Maybe the bullet hit a cabin door seal and compromised it.
240	00:13:10	00:13:12	I got something.
241	00:13:12	00:13:13	Bullet hole?
242	00:13:13	00:13:15	No, but I think our inside job just turned into an outside job.
243	00:13:17	00:13:20	Tool marks on the outside edge.
244	00:13:20	00:13:23	This door was tampered with before the plane even took off.
245	00:13:23	00:13:24	Sabotage.
246	00:13:24	00:13:26	We've been looking at this the wrong way.
247	00:13:26	00:13:27	Maybe the motive wasn't hijacking.
248	00:13:27	00:13:29	Maybe it was straight-up murder.
249	00:13:34	00:13:36	So the plane was doomed before it even took off.
250	00:13:36	00:13:39	Yeah, somebody on the ground made sure of that.
251	00:13:39	00:13:40	Tampered with the cabin door seal.
252	00:13:40	00:13:44	The seal couldn't handle the increasing pressure, and finally the door blew out.
253	00:13:44	00:13:47	We're talking murder now, not hijacking.
254	00:13:47	00:13:48	Somebody on that plane was targeted.
255	00:13:48	00:13:57	We've got our pilot, Keith Mannheim, and our other three remaining passengers, Charles Harrigan, the man we thought was our hijacker.
256	00:13:57	00:14:03	You know, if he got into a squabble with the Mediterranean, maybe he got into a fight with someone else, somebody he shouldn't have.
257	00:14:03	00:14:08	Yeah, it could have put a target on his back, or maybe the target's just one of the other passengers, our John or Jane Doe.
258	00:14:08	00:14:11	There is one other possibility. What's that?
259	00:14:11	00:14:14	Maybe the plane was the target.
260	00:14:14	00:14:17	Didn't see this on the outside of the door.
261	00:14:17	00:14:20	Must have gotten wedged in the seal.
262	00:14:20	00:14:26	Got paint trace from what I hope is our outil de sabotage.
263	00:14:26	00:14:27	It's all yours.
264	00:14:30	00:14:33	So this, uh, NTSB guy, Wilson.
265	00:14:33	00:14:35	Seems like a good sort.
266	00:14:35	00:14:36	He is.
267	00:14:36	00:14:41	When you guys worked together in Frisco, were you, uh...close?
268	00:14:41	00:14:43	Well, it was a pretty lengthy investigation.
269	00:14:43	00:14:45	We spent a lot of time together.
270	00:14:45	00:14:48	Yeah, there's spending time together, and there's...
271	00:14:48	00:14:49	spending time together.
272	00:14:49	00:14:51	What are you getting at, Hodges?
273	00:14:51	00:14:54	I--I'm not getting at anything.
274	00:14:54	00:14:55	How's it going in here?
275	00:14:55	00:14:57	Well, the Mikrosil's ready.
276	00:14:57	00:14:58	Good.
277	00:14:58	00:15:00	Good cast.
278	00:15:00	00:15:01	No bubbles.
279	00:15:01	00:15:03	You can see the tool marks.
280	00:15:03	00:15:04	Helps if you get in close, doesn't it?
281	00:15:07	00:15:08	Is that...is that paint transfer?
282	00:15:08	00:15:10	Indeed.
283	00:15:10	00:15:13	Don't you have, like, a machine to go put that in?
284	00:15:13	00:15:14	Say no more.
285	00:15:14	00:15:15	Three's a crowd.
286	00:15:17	00:15:19	Come and knock on my door.
287	00:15:20	00:15:22	What's his problem?
288	00:15:22	00:15:24	Don't even get me started.
289	00:15:24	00:15:26	These marks are paired.
290	00:15:26	00:15:28	I'm thinking that the tool might have been two-pronged.
291	00:15:28	00:15:34	You can tell what kind of tool it was? No, but between the Mikrosil cast and the paint chips, if we find it, we should get a match.
292	00:15:34	00:15:37	You know, whoever tampered with this cabin door knew exactly what they were doing.
293	00:15:37	00:15:41	Too much damage and the plane wouldn't have pressurized at all...
294	00:15:41	00:15:43	Setting off a warning light in the cabin.
295	00:15:43	00:15:45	The pilot would've turned the plane around immediately.
296	00:15:45	00:15:47	Too little damage would've had no effect at all.
297	00:15:47	00:15:49	Saboteur had to get it just right.
298	00:15:49	00:15:51	Suggests an intimate knowledge of the plane.
299	00:15:55	00:15:56	Hello!
300	00:15:56	00:15:58	Are you Hal?
301	00:15:58	00:15:59	Yeah, I'm Hal.
302	00:15:59	00:16:03	Yeah, the same Hal that, uh, did the maintenance on that charter jet that went down last night?
303	00:16:03	00:16:05	I--I already gave the logs to NTSB.
304	00:16:05	00:16:07	Look, I'm good at what I do.
305	00:16:07	00:16:09	I checked and double-checked every system on that plane.
306	00:16:09	00:16:12	Well, we're not saying that an oversight caused it to crash.
307	00:16:12	00:16:13	No, we're saying somebody brought it down.
308	00:16:13	00:16:17	Can you tell us about your relationship with LVN Charter.
309	00:16:17	00:16:19	Yeah, my relationship is fine.
310	00:16:19	00:16:21	Been taking care of their plane ever since I left Beaufort.
311	00:16:21	00:16:24	When was the last time they paid you?
312	00:16:25	00:16:27	Yeah, it's been a while.
313	00:16:27	00:16:29	Been a while? It's been, like, four months, hasn't it?
314	00:16:29	00:16:31	They owe you over six grand.
315	00:16:31	00:16:35	Hey, look, I'm not going to sabotage a plane over a lousy six grand.
316	00:16:36	00:16:37	These are your tools, right?
317	00:16:37	00:16:40	Yeah, they're my tools.
318	00:16:40	00:16:43	Well, you certainly have an interesting way of marking them.
319	00:16:43	00:16:44	Helps me keep track of them.
320	00:16:44	00:16:47	Green color is the same that we found on the cabin door.
321	00:16:47	00:16:50	What? You're saying somebody messed with the plane using my tools?
322	00:16:50	00:16:52	No, we're wondering if maybe you messed with it.
323	00:16:52	00:16:55	I didn't mess with it, all right?
324	00:16:55	00:16:56	I been in Laughlin the last couple of days.
325	00:16:56	00:16:58	I got back this morning.
326	00:16:58	00:17:00	Yeah, well, I'm packing up your tools.
327	00:17:00	00:17:01	They're coming with me now.
328	00:17:01	00:17:03	These tools are my livelihood.
329	00:17:03	00:17:08	Hey, you maintain a jet that took a nose dive into the ground last night, I don't think your phone's ringing off the hook.
330	00:17:08	00:17:10	Is it?
331	00:17:34	00:17:36	Sorry. Quick question.
332	00:17:36	00:17:39	I'm having a little trouble searching your father's surname.
333	00:17:39	00:17:42	Did you ever see it spelled E-K-L-I?
334	00:17:42	00:17:44	Actually, yes.
335	00:17:44	00:17:46	I think my grandfather-- I've seen him spell it that way.
336	00:17:46	00:17:48	Brilliant. I knew it.
337	00:17:48	00:17:49	Uh, I have a question for you.
338	00:17:49	00:17:53	In your genealogy work, have you heard of ITS Labs?
339	00:17:53	00:17:54	Indeed I have.
340	00:17:54	00:17:57	ITS is a DNA lab in Dallas.
341	00:17:57	00:18:03	Their business specializes in do-it-yourself DNA analysis in paternity suits.
342	00:18:03	00:18:04	Paternity suits? Mm-hmm.
343	00:18:04	00:18:08	The lab mails you a DNA kit, you do your own swabbing.
344	00:18:08	00:18:10	Wrap it up and mail it back.
345	00:18:10	00:18:11	Answer comes in a couple of weeks.
346	00:18:11	00:18:13	There's no name on the return label.
347	00:18:13	00:18:16	Well, for confidentiality, they use serial numbers to identify the client.
348	00:18:16	00:18:18	Look at the shipping label.
349	00:18:18	00:18:22	Great. With a warrant, I might have Jane Doe's I.D.
350	00:18:22	00:18:25	You may also have motive.
351	00:18:25	00:18:29	I'm sorry. I couldn't help but overhear about the plane being sabotaged.
352	00:18:29	00:18:35	You know that paternity suits are particularly contentious.
353	00:18:35	00:18:38	Contentious enough to make Jane Doe our target?
354	00:18:38	00:18:49	I remember hearing about a fast-food franchise mogul who fathered a child with his secretary, and when she tried to prove paternity and get child support, he, uh, dunked her in the fryer.
355	00:18:49	00:18:51	I'm just throwing it out there.
356	00:18:54	00:18:56	I'm just going to give this to Henry.
357	00:19:08	00:19:10	You can take that. I'll come back.
358	00:19:10	00:19:11	No, that's all right.
359	00:19:11	00:19:13	I--I'll call him back later.
360	00:19:18	00:19:19	If you ever feel like talking...
361	00:19:22	00:19:23	You ever tried the long-distance thing?
362	00:19:23	00:19:28	No, but I think it would have helped my relationship with husband number two.
363	00:19:28	00:19:29	Ah, the Seattle ex?
364	00:19:29	00:19:31	Yeah.
365	00:19:31	00:19:34	What was that like, seeing him again?
366	00:19:34	00:19:36	It was weird.
367	00:19:36	00:19:38	And then it wasn't.
368	00:19:38	00:19:40	You know, I wondered why you took a later flight.
369	00:19:40	00:19:43	What about your NTSB guy?
370	00:19:43	00:19:44	Is that weird?
371	00:19:44	00:19:46	Very weird.
372	00:19:48	00:19:50	Gonna stay that way?
373	00:19:50	00:19:52	It has to, right?
374	00:19:56	00:20:02	This looks promising. Similar tool marks as the sabotage that we found on the cabin door.
375	00:20:02	00:20:04	Can you pass me those, uh, paint chips that Hodges found?
376	00:20:04	00:20:06	Sure.
377	00:20:06	00:20:07	Thanks.
378	00:20:15	00:20:17	Got a physical match.
379	00:20:17	00:20:19	Got a murder weapon.
380	00:20:19	00:20:21	But not a murder suspect.
381	00:20:21	00:20:23	Hal the mechanic's alibi checked out.
382	00:20:23	00:20:28	Eye in the sky at the Lucky Stakes Casino in Laughlin had him at the tables three nights in a row.
383	00:20:28	00:20:30	So Hal's off the hook.
384	00:20:30	00:20:32	But somebody helped themselves to his tools.
385	00:20:32	00:20:34	Yeah, someone who had access to the airport.
386	00:20:34	00:20:39	Surveillance hasn't come in yet, but maybe we'll get lucky and find our killer on it.
387	00:20:39	00:20:42	Well, in the meantime, we have a lead on our other John Doe.
388	00:20:42	00:20:46	The gun's not registered to Harrigan like we thought.
389	00:20:46	00:20:48	It's actually registered to a Jeffrey Forsythe.
390	00:20:48	00:20:50	He's a partner in a law firm downtown.
391	00:20:50	00:20:51	Brass called the office.
392	00:20:51	00:20:53	Apparently, Forsythe wasn't on the plane.
393	00:20:53	00:20:55	Maybe he knows who was.
394	00:20:55	00:21:00	Mr. Forsythe, we matched the serial numbers on this gun found at the crash site to you.
395	00:21:00	00:21:01	It's your gun.
396	00:21:01	00:21:05	I leant it to my colleague, my friend Grant Abbott.
397	00:21:05	00:21:07	He was on that plane.
398	00:21:07	00:21:11	Our firm uses LVN Charters exclusively.
399	00:21:11	00:21:14	Grant told me he was flying to Chicago last week.
400	00:21:14	00:21:17	He used to live there, still has a place.
401	00:21:17	00:21:19	He'd decided to take a little time off.
402	00:21:19	00:21:21	Why?
403	00:21:21	00:21:24	Same reason he was carrying my gun.
404	00:21:24	00:21:27	Grant is the go-to criminal attorney at our firm.
405	00:21:27	00:21:32	He represents numerous clients with, uh, proclivities to violence.
406	00:21:32	00:21:36	Did Mr. Abbott have any concerns about any of these clients in particular?
407	00:21:36	00:21:44	I can tell you that Grant had a misunderstanding with one client, who subsequently fired our firm and made veiled threats.
408	00:21:44	00:21:46	I'm going to need that name.
409	00:21:46	00:21:48	Donna, I've heard so much about you.
410	00:21:48	00:21:50	It's a pleasure to meet you.
411	00:21:50	00:21:51	The pleasure is mine.
412	00:21:51	00:21:55	Donna was helping me with my family tree, but now she is helping us with a case.
413	00:21:55	00:21:58	We found a DNA kit in our Jane Doe's luggage.
414	00:21:58	00:22:01	Thanks to Donna, we were able to trace it back to a private lab.
415	00:22:01	00:22:03	They gave us a name.
416	00:22:03	00:22:05	Jordan Lowell, Chicago address.
417	00:22:05	00:22:08	Requested a kit two weeks ago from ITS Labs.
418	00:22:08	00:22:10	What's that about?
419	00:22:10	00:22:14	Well, we think she may have been looking for proof of paternity in a potential child support case.
420	00:22:14	00:22:18	Jordan Lowell may have had a baby with the wrong kind of guy.
421	00:22:18	00:22:20	Okay, do we know if she used the, uh, DNA kit?
422	00:22:20	00:22:22	It looks that way.
423	00:22:22	00:22:23	Henry's running the swabs now.
424	00:22:23	00:22:29	If the victim was able to obtain an exemplar from the father, you could have the DNA of the killer.
425	00:22:29	00:22:31	We could. You're right.
426	00:22:31	00:22:33	Then again, I just got a call from Brass.
427	00:22:33	00:22:39	Turns out that the passenger with the gun was a criminal attorney who may have disappointed a client.
428	00:22:39	00:22:40	Hey. Yeah?
429	00:22:40	00:22:42	You're not going to believe this.
430	00:22:42	00:22:47	A lady in Henderson returned home from a business trip, found some dude floating in her pool.
431	00:22:47	00:22:48	So?
432	00:22:48	00:22:50	He came from the plane.
433	00:22:52	00:22:54	There was another passenger on board? No.
434	00:22:54	00:23:00	According to the driver's license, he was the pilot, Keith Mannheim.
435	00:23:00	00:23:04	So if he's our pilot, who's the dead guy in the cockpit?
436	00:23:10	00:23:13	Doc, I thought we already found our pilot.
437	00:23:13	00:23:15	Please, make sense of this for me.
438	00:23:15	00:23:17	I'll try.
439	00:23:17	00:23:23	Prints and DNA both confirm this body-- the one pulled out of a pool in Henderson-- is our pilot. Keith Mannheim.
440	00:23:23	00:23:26	Victim has a distinctive, crescent-shaped head wound.
441	00:23:26	00:23:31	Looks like some sort of blunt-force trauma unrelated to the rest of his injuries.
442	00:23:31	00:23:35	The skin tearing and fractures are both consistent with a high-altitude fall.
443	00:23:35	00:23:39	All right, what about the other remains that we found in the cockpit?
444	00:23:39	00:23:42	Well, now that we know it's someone else, Henry's running the DNA.
445	00:23:42	00:23:46	So we have a mystery man that we found in the cockpit who's not the pilot.
446	00:23:46	00:23:49	How the hell does that work?
447	00:23:49	00:23:51	So, we got five people on the plane.
448	00:23:51	00:24:00	If our pilot, Keith Mannheim, is at the controls, then our mystery man from the cockpit wreckage must have been sitting in the copilot's seat.
449	00:24:00	00:24:03	Two in front, three passengers in back.
450	00:24:03	00:24:07	17-minute mark, we have the slow loss of cabin pressure.
451	00:24:07	00:24:10	Mannheim radios he's turning around.
452	00:24:10	00:24:12	Maybe the pilot wants to check something out.
453	00:24:12	00:24:14	Maybe that's why he gets out of his seat.
454	00:24:14	00:24:17	Yeah, but not before Mannheim enters in the vector coordinates for a return.
455	00:24:17	00:24:20	Making a slow descent.
456	00:24:24	00:24:26	A few seconds later, door blows.
457	00:24:30	00:24:32	And Mannheim gets sucked out the plane door.
458	00:24:32	00:24:36	Doc Robbins said that he had a crescent-shaped head wound.
459	00:24:38	00:24:40	Looks like he hit his head on the way out, huh?
460	00:24:40	00:24:42	Uh-huh. One mystery solved.
461	00:24:42	00:24:43	One step at a time.
462	00:24:43	00:24:44	Hey, guys.
463	00:24:44	00:24:48	Uh, Henry ran the DNA from our mystery man through CODIS, and he got a hit.
464	00:24:48	00:24:51	A parolee named Thurston Mayfield, aka Thor.
465	00:24:51	00:24:52	Thor?
466	00:24:52	00:24:57	Specialized in writing phony checks, and recently was a dancer in an all-male revue.
467	00:24:57	00:25:00	Now, the club is just two blocks from the executive airport.
468	00:25:00	00:25:02	Brass talked to the owner.
469	00:25:02	00:25:04	It turns out that Thor quit last week.
470	00:25:04	00:25:08	He said he was moving in with his new boyfriend, Keith Mannheim.
471	00:25:08	00:25:11	That would explain why Thor was sitting up front in the cockpit.
472	00:25:11	00:25:14	Keith was flying his new boyfriend home to Chicago to meet the folks.
473	00:25:14	00:25:20	And if Keith's partner Dalton found out about it, might be reason enough to want them both dead.
474	00:25:20	00:25:23	You know that guy?
475	00:25:23	00:25:24	No.
476	00:25:24	00:25:28	Classic case of I didn't recognize him with his clothes on.
477	00:25:28	00:25:30	How about now?
478	00:25:30	00:25:34	The place where he dances is right out by your airport.
479	00:25:34	00:25:36	Yeah, I guess.
480	00:25:36	00:25:38	I--I've been there a few times times with Keith.
481	00:25:38	00:25:40	Yeah, old Keith, he went there a lot on his own, didn't he?
482	00:25:40	00:25:49	It means that we talked to some people at the club, and it, uh, turns out that Thor and Keith were having a thing.
483	00:25:49	00:25:51	It was kind of hot and heavy.
484	00:25:53	00:25:55	Well, if that's true, I didn't know about it.
485	00:25:55	00:25:59	Suppose you didn't know that Thor was on that plane, neither, huh?
486	00:25:59	00:26:00	With Keith?
487	00:26:00	00:26:02	Cockpit, right by Keith's side.
488	00:26:02	00:26:04	He was flying home to meet Keith's parents.
489	00:26:04	00:26:08	Yeah, it must suck having your partner cheat on you with someone like this.
490	00:26:08	00:26:10	That would really piss me off.
491	00:26:10	00:26:14	You know, maybe just enough to actually do something about it.
492	00:26:17	00:26:22	You think I brought down my own plane with the most important person in the world to me on board?
493	00:26:22	00:26:25	Well, the way I see it, the plane's insured, right?
494	00:26:25	00:26:31	I mean, with Keith out of the way, you can start the business over, and this time without having to share the profits with some cheating boyfriend.
495	00:26:31	00:26:37	Fuel log says that you refueled and performed the last safety check on that plane 12 hours before it crashed.
496	00:26:37	00:26:39	I didn't sabotage my own plane!
497	00:26:39	00:26:41	In the heat of anger. I get it.
498	00:26:41	00:26:44	No. No, you people don't get it.
499	00:26:44	00:26:45	I lost everything in that crash.
500	00:26:48	00:26:49	Everything.
501	00:26:55	00:26:58	Looks like you got the airport surveillance. Yeah.
502	00:26:58	00:27:00	Sugar, no cream?
503	00:27:00	00:27:02	Thanks. Mm-hmm.
504	00:27:02	00:27:04	Anything?
505	00:27:04	00:27:09	Nothing yet, but I did confirm Burk refilling the plane and doing a safety check 12 hours before takeoff.
506	00:27:09	00:27:12	He never touched the plane door, and so far, nobody else has touched the plane.
507	00:27:14	00:27:19	Listen, Sara, I was just wondering if I could buy you and Grissom dinner tonight.
508	00:27:19	00:27:22	You guys pick the place, NTSB picks up the tab.
509	00:27:22	00:27:24	I'm a hell of a third wheel.
510	00:27:24	00:27:27	Actually, Gil's out of town.
511	00:27:27	00:27:28	Okay, just the two of us, then?
512	00:27:28	00:27:30	Don't. Don't what?
513	00:27:30	00:27:32	Do this.
514	00:27:32	00:27:33	Okay.
515	00:27:35	00:27:41	I mean, if everything's good between you two-- and I know you, Sara, so I'm getting the feeling that maybe it isn't-- then, I understand.
516	00:27:41	00:27:43	Everything's great.
517	00:27:43	00:27:45	Okay.
518	00:27:49	00:27:51	Fuel truck--stopping in front of the plane.
519	00:27:51	00:27:52	Right in front of the cabin door.
520	00:27:52	00:27:54	What's he doing? They already refueled.
521	00:27:54	00:27:56	One guy's getting out of the truck.
522	00:27:58	00:28:00	He was only there for two minutes.
523	00:28:00	00:28:02	Is that enough time to sabotage a plane?
524	00:28:02	00:28:03	Yes, it is.
525	00:28:03	00:28:05	Can you get a better look at the driver?
526	00:28:05	00:28:07	I can't bring up a face.
527	00:28:07	00:28:10	But look at this.
528	00:28:10	00:28:11	Beaufort Aero Club patch.
529	00:28:11	00:28:12	Those are Hal's overalls.
530	00:28:12	00:28:14	And we know that Hal was out of town.
531	00:28:14	00:28:15	We know that somebody borrowed his tools.
532	00:28:15	00:28:17	Borrowed his clothes, as well.
533	00:28:37	00:28:39	I got your results.
534	00:28:39	00:28:43	DNA on the coveralls did not match Dalton Burk, so...
535	00:28:43	00:28:44	goodbye prime suspect.
536	00:28:44	00:28:46	Sorry. It's a dead end.
537	00:28:46	00:28:51	Were you able to run the ITS DNA kit that Morgan found in Jordan Lowell's luggage?
538	00:28:51	00:28:57	Yeah. Jordan used two of the swabs, but both were degraded, probably from the crash and the fire, so I couldn't get DNA.
539	00:28:57	00:29:01	The weird thing is, Morgan said she thought this all had to do with a paternity suit.
540	00:29:01	00:29:05	Right. But to do a paternity test, you need to use three swabs.
541	00:29:05	00:29:07	Yeah, you're absolutely right.
542	00:29:07	00:29:09	One for each of the parents, and one for the child.
543	00:29:09	00:29:12	So what was Jordan Lowell testing for, then?
544	00:29:12	00:29:18	Most people use ITS to verify the baby's father, but a lot of people use it to find their own father.
545	00:29:18	00:29:21	Do you think that's what Jordan Lowell was doing?
546	00:29:21	00:29:22	I know that's what she was doing.
547	00:29:22	00:29:24	Just got off the phone with her roommate in Chicago.
548	00:29:24	00:29:27	Turns out Jordan was raised by a single mother.
549	00:29:27	00:29:31	After her mother died, she started looking for her father that she'd never met.
550	00:29:31	00:29:33	Her roommate said she got a lead in Vegas.
551	00:29:33	00:29:36	Donna, you think this is something you can help us with?
552	00:29:36	00:29:37	Give me a birthplace and a birth date.
553	00:29:37	00:29:39	Right there.
554	00:29:39	00:29:43	Well, we'll start looking for the father by searching for Jordan's birth certificate.
555	00:29:43	00:29:45	No name for the father.
556	00:29:45	00:29:46	But that makes sense.
557	00:29:46	00:29:48	That's who she was looking for, right?
558	00:29:48	00:29:49	Look at the mother's age.
559	00:29:49	00:29:51	Back in 1968.
560	00:29:51	00:29:55	There were a lot of strict rules about what unwed mothers could put on the birth certificate.
561	00:29:55	00:29:58	They could only give the baby their own surname.
562	00:29:58	00:30:05	But the rules only applied to the baby's last name, so sometimes the girls took the father's surname and made it the baby's first name.
563	00:30:05	00:30:07	You mean like Jordan. Mm-hmm.
564	00:30:07	00:30:11	Sounds like we should be looking for a Mr. Jordan in Las Vegas.
565	00:30:11	00:30:15	Morgan, did Jordan's roommate ever mention if she used a genealogy Web site?
566	00:30:15	00:30:18	Yeah, actually, uh, she said she used ancestry.com.
567	00:30:18	00:30:19	Great!
568	00:30:19	00:30:27	Ancestry not only helps people find their relatives, but if it finds two people who are searching for the same relative, it connects them.
569	00:30:27	00:30:31	So if we input the same information that Jordan did, the we'll be able to find what she found.
570	00:30:31	00:30:33	Let me just link into Jordan's family tree.
571	00:30:36	00:30:39	And there he is-- Jordan's father.
572	00:30:39	00:30:42	Joseph Donovan Jordan.
573	00:30:42	00:30:44	Looks like she found him, but a little too late.
574	00:30:44	00:30:46	Died December 12, 2005.
575	00:30:46	00:30:49	Yeah, but look below his name.
576	00:30:49	00:30:52	He had a daughter-- Helen, born in 1962.
577	00:30:52	00:30:53	Half-sister.
578	00:30:53	00:30:57	So maybe Helen is the lead that Jordan found in Vegas.
579	00:30:57	00:30:59	Mm-hmm. And that's why Jordan used the DNA kit.
580	00:30:59	00:31:03	She swabbed herself, so she could compare her DNA with that of her sister's.
581	00:31:03	00:31:05	I'm looking up Helen Jordan right now.
582	00:31:05	00:31:07	And I'm getting nothing.
583	00:31:07	00:31:08	Not a driver's license?
584	00:31:08	00:31:09	Not even a Social Security number.
585	00:31:09	00:31:11	How is that possible?
586	00:31:11	00:31:12	Okay, well, hold on.
587	00:31:12	00:31:15	There's a link under Helen's name.
588	00:31:15	00:31:18	Looks like we just found Helen Jordan.
589	00:31:18	00:31:20	Are you feeling all right today?
590	00:31:20	00:31:23	We didn't realize Helen Jordan wasn't living on her own.
591	00:31:23	00:31:25	Yeah, how long has she been under your care, Dr. O'Keefe?
592	00:31:25	00:31:29	Helen's been at our facility for almost 40 years now.
593	00:31:29	00:31:30	Since she was 12.
594	00:31:31	00:31:33	Helen?
595	00:31:33	00:31:36	These nice people have come to visit.
596	00:31:36	00:31:37	Uh...
597	00:31:37	00:31:39	I don't understand.
598	00:31:39	00:31:42	Helen was in a car accident when she was ten.
599	00:31:42	00:31:47	Her mother was killed and she was left, well, as you see her.
600	00:31:47	00:31:51	Her father tried several special hospitals before bringing her here.
601	00:31:54	00:31:56	Helen?
602	00:31:56	00:31:59	Did a woman named Jordan Lowell visit Helen recently?
603	00:31:59	00:32:01	Yes. Several times over the past few months.
604	00:32:01	00:32:04	She was wonderful. Read to her for hours.
605	00:32:04	00:32:07	She told me she thought Helen was her half-sister.
606	00:32:07	00:32:09	Even took a DNA sample.
607	00:32:10	00:32:12	We're gonna have to do the same.
608	00:32:12	00:32:15	Is there some reason the police are interested in Helen?
609	00:32:15	00:32:19	Actually, we're interested in the woman who came to visit her-- Jordan Lowell.
610	00:32:19	00:32:22	Please don't tell me she's some sort of scam artist.
611	00:32:22	00:32:23	No, ma'am.
612	00:32:23	00:32:25	She's dead.
613	00:32:25	00:32:26	She died in a plane crash yesterday.
614	00:32:26	00:32:27	Oh, my Lord.
615	00:32:27	00:32:30	She was just here.
616	00:32:30	00:32:32	Helen's father never visited.
617	00:32:32	00:32:34	I understand he died a few years ago.
618	00:32:34	00:32:39	I had hoped that, after all these years, that Helen had someone who wasn't a stranger to hold her hand.
619	00:32:44	00:32:45	Talk about a tragic story.
620	00:32:45	00:32:47	And an unlucky family.
621	00:32:47	00:32:50	Well, someone in that family had good fortune.
622	00:32:50	00:32:52	I mean, you saw that place; it's pretty high-end.
623	00:32:52	00:32:55	40 years of constant care.
624	00:32:55	00:32:56	It would cost a pretty penny.
625	00:32:56	00:32:59	The kind of money Joseph Jordan would amass over a lifetime.
626	00:32:59	00:33:02	I looked into Jordan's father.
627	00:33:02	00:33:05	His family's owned property in Nevada for over a century.
628	00:33:05	00:33:09	He made a fortune in ranching, mining, and real estate.
629	00:33:09	00:33:14	And when Joe Jordan died, he left over $100 million in a trust to Helen.
630	00:33:14	00:33:16	Does it say who controls the trust now?
631	00:33:16	00:33:18	No. Those terms are confidential.
632	00:33:18	00:33:25	But it looks like the trust donates several million dollars to a nonprofit home for the disabled every year.
633	00:33:25	00:33:28	Let me take a wild guess-- Tranquil Hours?
634	00:33:28	00:33:30	Correct.
635	00:33:30	00:33:33	So Tranquil Hours is getting millions from Helen Jordan's estate.
636	00:33:33	00:33:38	And then, one day, Jordan Lowell shows up and takes a DNA sample from Helen.
637	00:33:38	00:33:44	Hoping to prove she's part of the family and perhaps entitled to a big share of her newfound inheritance.
638	00:33:44	00:33:46	You thinking what I'm thinking? (cell phone chimes)
639	00:33:46	00:33:48	Tranquil Hours saw Jordan as a threat.
640	00:33:50	00:33:52	Just one problem with our theory.
641	00:33:52	00:33:55	You know the DNA sample we took from Helen?
642	00:33:55	00:33:58	Well, Henry just compared it to Jordan Lowell's DNA.
643	00:33:58	00:34:00	Helen and Jordan aren't sisters.
644	00:34:01	00:34:03	That's impossible, Hojem-Sanders.
645	00:34:03	00:34:06	I'm sorry, Donna, but it's science.
646	00:34:06	00:34:07	Your science, not mine.
647	00:34:09	00:34:14	Mr. Russell, my research is meticulous, my methods precise.
648	00:34:14	00:34:18	I fact-check and verify my information at every turn.
649	00:34:18	00:34:22	I'd like to say I make mistakes, but I don't make mistakes.
650	00:34:22	00:34:26	Jordan Lowell's half-sister was at Tranquil Hours.
651	00:34:26	00:34:34	Donna, I'm sorry, but science is science, and the DNA results show conclusively that Helen Jordan and Jordan Lowell are not half-sisters.
652	00:34:34	00:34:37	They're not even related.
653	00:34:37	00:34:38	A little help here?
654	00:34:38	00:34:40	Well, maybe you're both right.
655	00:34:40	00:34:44	I mean, who's to say that microfiche and microcentrifuges don't mix?
656	00:34:44	00:34:46	I don't know what you're talking about.
657	00:34:46	00:34:50	Finally, we agree. Jordan Lowell found her sister, Helen Jordan, through genealogy.
658	00:34:50	00:34:51	Right.
659	00:34:51	00:34:56	But DNA proves that the woman she found at Tranquil Hours was not her sister.
660	00:34:56	00:34:58	Right. So...
661	00:34:58	00:35:01	what happened to Jordan's sister?
662	00:35:01	00:35:04	And who's the woman pretending to be her at Tranquil Hours?
663	00:35:10	00:35:13	Obviously, something happened to the real Helen.
664	00:35:13	00:35:15	Maybe she died.
665	00:35:15	00:35:18	And maybe another patient was substituted in Helen's place.
666	00:35:18	00:35:21	Because the woman that I met was definitely not pretending.
667	00:35:21	00:35:24	All of which suggests a much wider conspiracy.
668	00:35:24	00:35:26	Why the conspiracy? Who benefits?
669	00:35:26	00:35:30	Well, Tranquil Hours does get several million dollars a year from Helen's trust.
670	00:35:30	00:35:32	And if she dies, the money dries up.
671	00:35:32	00:35:34	It's a Social Security scam.
672	00:35:34	00:35:37	Until Jordan Lowell shows up and threatens to expose all of that.
673	00:35:37	00:35:39	But Jordan showed up months ago.
674	00:35:39	00:35:42	Why did someone wait till yesterday to kill her in a plane crash?
675	00:35:42	00:35:44	Ah.
676	00:35:44	00:35:45	The DNA kit.
677	00:35:45	00:35:47	Right.
678	00:35:47	00:35:53	Jordan swabs the fake Helen, and that is when somebody at Tranquil Hours got spooked-- 'cause they realized they were about to be found out.
679	00:35:53	00:35:57	How wide is this wider conspiracy?
680	00:35:57	00:35:59	Don't know.
681	00:35:59	00:36:02	But if I were you, I would start with Helen's doctor.
682	00:36:06	00:36:07	Excuse me. Can I help you?
683	00:36:07	00:36:09	Yeah, we're here to see Dr. O'Keefe.
684	00:36:09	00:36:10	She called in sick this morning.
685	00:36:10	00:36:12	Big surprise.
686	00:36:12	00:36:14	Uh, in that case, we'd like to see Helen Jordan.
687	00:36:14	00:36:16	We have a warrant for her fingerprints.
688	00:36:16	00:36:18	I'm sorry.
689	00:36:18	00:36:21	Helen was transferred to a critical care facility a few hours ago.
690	00:36:21	00:36:22	Really? Where?
691	00:36:22	00:36:24	You'd have to ask Dr. O'Keefe.
692	00:36:24	00:36:28	Okay. Well, if her room hasn't been transferred, we're going to need to see it.
693	00:36:41	00:36:42	You smell that?
694	00:36:42	00:36:44	Bleach.
695	00:36:44	00:36:46	Mm-hmm.
696	00:36:51	00:36:53	Not a speck of dust.
697	00:36:53	00:36:58	No DNA, no trace, and probably no fingerprints.
698	00:36:58	00:36:59	Hold that thought.
699	00:37:09	00:37:11	Maybe we do have Helen's fingerprint.
700	00:37:12	00:37:14	They always miss something.
701	00:37:16	00:37:17	Nick. Yeah?
702	00:37:17	00:37:19	Get this.
703	00:37:19	00:37:22	Henry found a sibling match between our killer and the impostor in the wheelchair.
704	00:37:22	00:37:28	What do you mean? The swab we got off our impostor has multiple alleles in common with the DNA we pulled from the coveralls of our saboteur.
705	00:37:28	00:37:30	Mmm. So what? We still don't have a name.
706	00:37:30	00:37:32	We do.
707	00:37:32	00:37:37	Print we got from the room at Tranquil Hours comes back to a Marcia Forsythe.
708	00:37:37	00:37:39	As in Jeffrey Forsythe?
709	00:37:39	00:37:42	Well, he's the guy who loaned his gun to the lawyer who died in the crash.
710	00:37:42	00:37:43	She's his sister.
711	00:37:43	00:37:45	She had a skiing accident-- brain damage.
712	00:37:45	00:37:46	He put her in Tranquil Hours.
713	00:37:46	00:37:49	He's the trustee in charge of Helen Jordan's millions.
714	00:37:49	00:37:51	Mmm. I'll call Brass.
715	00:37:51	00:37:53	I already called Forsythe's law firm.
716	00:37:53	00:37:55	He's on his way out of town for a business trip.
717	00:37:55	00:37:56	Flying his own plane.
718	00:38:07	00:38:09	Are you going somewhere, Mr. Forsythe?
719	00:38:09	00:38:10	Is there a problem, officers?
720	00:38:10	00:38:14	I don't know. Have you checked your cabin door seals lately?
721	00:38:14	00:38:20	We know about your scam, siphoning millions from Helen Jordan, enriching yourself at her expense.
722	00:38:20	00:38:23	And putting your sister in her place whenever anyone came to visit.
723	00:38:23	00:38:26	Oh, and by the way, we found her stashed away in another hospital.
724	00:38:26	00:38:29	These are absurd allegations. I don't think so.
725	00:38:29	00:38:32	We've arrested the good doctor, and she's confessed.
726	00:38:32	00:38:35	So, perhaps there was a little creative accounting.
727	00:38:35	00:38:36	A victimless crime.
728	00:38:36	00:38:39	That plane crash wasn't victimless.
729	00:38:39	00:38:42	You can't possibly think I had anything to do with that.
730	00:38:42	00:38:48	I already told you my associate, Grant Abbott, had enemies--the type that were capable of doing such heinous acts.
731	00:38:48	00:38:50	Just stop, okay?
732	00:38:50	00:38:54	We already know that you persuaded Dr. O'Keefe to offer Jordan a free charter flight to Chicago.
733	00:38:54	00:38:55	Plus you had access.
734	00:38:55	00:38:57	Got your plane at the airport.
735	00:38:57	00:39:00	You know, people wouldn't think twice seeing you walk in and out of the hangar.
736	00:39:00	00:39:02	That's wildly speculative.
737	00:39:02	00:39:04	DNA evidence isn't. What DNA?
738	00:39:04	00:39:05	Yours.
739	00:39:05	00:39:09	Found on the coveralls you were wearing when you sabotaged the plane's cabin door.
740	00:39:09	00:39:11	You're bluffing.
741	00:39:11	00:39:13	You don't have a sample of my DNA for comparison.
742	00:39:13	00:39:14	We have your sister's.
743	00:39:14	00:39:16	That's good enough.
744	00:39:16	00:39:18	You killed five people on that plane.
745	00:39:18	00:39:20	It's just dumb luck you didn't kill more on the ground.
746	00:39:20	00:39:25	I hope you saved some of the money you stole, because you're going to need it to hire a lawyer a lot smarter than you.
747	00:39:25	00:39:26	Get him out of here.
748	00:39:26	00:39:28	Okay.
749	00:39:35	00:39:37	I heard you got your man.
750	00:39:37	00:39:38	Yeah.
751	00:39:38	00:39:40	Thanks to you.
752	00:39:40	00:39:41	Little help from DNA.
753	00:39:41	00:39:45	You don't see genealogy as a pure science, do you, Mr. Russell?
754	00:39:45	00:39:46	I wouldn't say that.
755	00:39:46	00:39:50	It is, after all, a systematic pursuit of knowledge, right?
756	00:39:50	00:39:54	Seeking an understanding of who we are and where we came from.
757	00:39:54	00:39:57	I mean, that sounds like science to me.
758	00:39:57	00:39:58	Maybe not pure, but...
759	00:39:58	00:40:04	(laughs) Well, if you ever need a little systematic pursuit of knowledge, you know where to find me.
760	00:40:04	00:40:06	Bye-bye.
761	00:40:08	00:40:10	What do you think?
762	00:40:10	00:40:12	Donna, this is awesome.
763	00:40:12	00:40:13	My dad is going to love it.
764	00:40:13	00:40:19	I just love that your family crest has an evergreen and reindeer on it.
765	00:40:19	00:40:21	It's perfect for Christmas. Perfect for Christmas.
766	00:40:21	00:40:26	Anyone ever tell you two that you're really very cute together?
767	00:40:26	00:40:28	But, of course, you'd want be careful.
768	00:40:28	00:40:31	Because Ekli and Hojem-Sanders are both Norwegian names.
769	00:40:31	00:40:34	They could branch off of the same family tree.
770	00:40:34	00:40:35	Which would make you kissing cousins.
771	00:40:39	00:40:41	But...probably not.
772	00:40:45	00:40:48	All right, I'll see you in a bit.
773	00:40:48	00:40:50	Cargo plane, San Jose.
774	00:40:50	00:40:52	All hands on deck.
775	00:40:52	00:40:53	No rest for the NTSB.
776	00:40:53	00:40:55	Nope.
777	00:40:55	00:40:57	So, I guess this is it.
778	00:40:57	00:40:58	Yeah.
779	00:41:00	00:41:03	Listen, about my, uh, dinner offer...
780	00:41:03	00:41:04	Oh. It's just that...
781	00:41:06	00:41:11	...seeing you again brought back a lot of good memories, Sara.
782	00:41:11	00:41:13	Honestly, it's kind of annoying how great you look.
783	00:41:15	00:41:17	Thanks.
784	00:41:17	00:41:18	I'm glad things worked out for you.
785	00:41:20	00:41:21	You deserve it.
786	00:41:24	00:41:25	Give my regards to the Bay.
787	00:41:25	00:41:27	Will do.
