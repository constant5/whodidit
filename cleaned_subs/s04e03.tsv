0	00:00:29	00:00:31	Hey man, this place is a dump.
1	00:00:31	00:00:35	I'm telling you, this bitch is loaded and no one's seen her for weeks.
2	00:00:37	00:00:38	Come on, this place is trashed.
3	00:00:38	00:00:40	You trying to make me look stupid?
4	00:00:40	00:00:42	No, man. I swear. Somebody must have beat us to it.
5	00:00:42	00:00:43	What the hell is this?
6	00:00:45	00:00:48	I'm out, man.
7	00:00:51	00:00:56	Gentlemen, put your hands on your heads, please.
8	00:01:29	00:01:31	Smudges.
9	00:01:31	00:01:33	Nothing but smudges.
10	00:01:33	00:01:36	Doesn't anybody use Formica anymore?
11	00:01:37	00:01:41	First thing we did when we saw this was call you guys.
12	00:01:41	00:01:42	Didn't touch a thing.
13	00:01:46	00:01:48	So you going to open it?
14	00:01:48	00:01:51	Eventually.
15	00:02:08	00:02:09	This is going to take all day.
16	00:02:11	00:02:17	Sun Tzu once said, If you wait by the river long enough, the bodies of your enemies will float by.
17	00:02:31	00:02:34	But those were brutal times.
18	00:03:20	00:03:22	Hey, hold up.
19	00:03:24	00:03:25	Warrick?
20	00:03:25	00:03:28	Hey, David. Give me a minute and let me clear a path here, okay?
21	00:03:28	00:03:30	All right, I'm not going anywhere.
22	00:03:30	00:03:32	All right.
23	00:03:36	00:03:39	There's at least four weeks of mail here, Grissom.
24	00:03:39	00:03:42	Four weeks of 100 degree days, zero percent humidity.
25	00:03:43	00:03:46	Eventually, the body tissues sublimate.
26	00:03:46	00:03:52	Cell fluids vaporize, and all that's left -- Proteins, fats and minerals.
27	00:03:52	00:03:55	Turns a grape into a raisin.
28	00:03:55	00:03:58	Well, the desert was making mummies long before the Egyptians.
29	00:04:01	00:04:03	Take a look at this.
30	00:04:08	00:04:10	And look at her fingers.
31	00:04:15	00:04:17	She tried to claw her way out.
32	00:04:17	00:04:19	Yeah.
33	00:04:20	00:04:24	Which means she was alive when she was entombed.
34	00:04:26	00:04:27	She was supposed to be, like, this old widow, right?
35	00:04:27	00:04:30	Like, always going out to dinner and coming home with shopping bags.
36	00:04:30	00:04:34	Bitch had insurance money and word was that she kept it in a box hidden under her bed.
37	00:04:34	00:04:36	A retired grade-school teacher living on a pension...
38	00:04:36	00:04:38	Listen, man, we didn't kill her.
39	00:04:38	00:04:39	No, I know that.
40	00:04:39	00:04:44	What I want to know is, other than the back door, did you or your partner touch anything in the house?
41	00:04:44	00:04:47	No. There was nothing left to touch, man.
42	00:05:12	00:05:14	Hey, Griss.
43	00:05:16	00:05:17	Seem kind of odd to you?
44	00:05:17	00:05:23	A woman who spends the time making tea like this leaves a chunk of chocolate cake on the counter.
45	00:05:24	00:05:26	With a big bite out of it? Yeah.
46	00:05:28	00:05:35	Some crack head brutalizes an old lady, leaves her in a closet, and grabs a snack on the way out.
47	00:05:35	00:05:36	Hopefully.
48	00:05:36	00:05:39	Take it back to the lab.
49	00:06:29	00:06:30	Shut up, get in there!
50	00:06:30	00:06:32	Oh!
51	00:06:59	00:07:01	Oh.
52	00:07:15	00:07:22	Fluoroscope showed no bullet or stab wounds, and apart from multiple fractures of her fingers and hands, no other apparent injuries.
53	00:07:23	00:07:26	So whoever boarded her up in the closet maybe didn't intend to kill her.
54	00:07:26	00:07:27	Yeah.
55	00:07:27	00:07:30	They must have thought somebody'd find her-- a friend or relative.
56	00:07:30	00:07:31	She lived alone.
57	00:07:31	00:07:33	Only relative was a nephew.
58	00:07:33	00:07:34	Brass is looking for him.
59	00:07:34	00:07:37	Live alone, die alone.
60	00:07:37	00:07:40	In this case, from massive dehydration.
61	00:07:41	00:07:46	Three minutes without air, three days without water, and three weeks without food.
62	00:07:46	00:07:49	Three days must have felt like three years.
63	00:07:50	00:07:52	Warrick said you found a possible print at the scene.
64	00:07:53	00:07:54	Need to rule hers out?
65	00:07:54	00:07:57	Yeah. Also need a dental impression.
66	00:07:57	00:07:59	Well, that'll be easy.
67	00:08:11	00:08:13	So, what do we have here?
68	00:08:13	00:08:17	Well, boy was out playing, found the weapon, fired one shot, dropped the weapon.
69	00:08:17	00:08:18	No one's touched it since.
70	00:08:18	00:08:19	Hmm.
71	00:08:19	00:08:21	Okay, thanks.
72	00:08:21	00:08:23	Yeah.
73	00:08:51	00:08:53	Hey, Nathan.
74	00:08:53	00:08:55	How's your foot?
75	00:08:55	00:08:56	I got a rocket ship Band-Aid.
76	00:08:57	00:08:58	Hmm.
77	00:08:58	00:09:00	Yeah, I see that.
78	00:09:00	00:09:03	Mrs. Timmel, does the gun belong to someone in the house?
79	00:09:03	00:09:04	No, absolutely not.
80	00:09:04	00:09:06	My husband and I don't believe in guns.
81	00:09:06	00:09:09	We moved here from the city because it was supposed to be safer.
82	00:09:10	00:09:12	Nathan, where did you find the gun?
83	00:09:12	00:09:15	Seymour found it.
84	00:09:15	00:09:16	Seymour?
85	00:09:16	00:09:18	His imaginary friend.
86	00:09:19	00:09:23	So, you were playing with Seymour, and he found the gun where?
87	00:09:23	00:09:24	Over there.
88	00:09:24	00:09:26	Well, where exactly?
89	00:09:26	00:09:27	In the backyard.
90	00:09:28	00:09:29	Was it buried?
91	00:09:29	00:09:30	Did you dig it up?
92	00:09:30	00:09:32	Nope.
93	00:09:36	00:09:38	Will you ever play with guns again?
94	00:09:38	00:09:41	Nope.
95	00:09:43	00:09:45	We don't need an I.D..
96	00:09:45	00:09:48	Oh, the nephew said he wanted to see her.
97	00:09:48	00:09:49	Insisted on it.
98	00:09:49	00:09:50	Made me curious.
99	00:09:51	00:09:53	You Connor Foster?
100	00:09:53	00:09:54	Yeah.
101	00:09:54	00:09:56	I'm sorry I'm late. I got lost.
102	00:09:58	00:10:01	This is the morgue, huh?
103	00:10:01	00:10:03	You have to prepare yourself for this.
104	00:10:03	00:10:07	Your aunt was found in an advanced state of decomposition.
105	00:10:11	00:10:14	Oh, this is messed up.
106	00:10:14	00:10:17	This is really messed up.
107	00:10:19	00:10:20	Whoa! She just moved.
108	00:10:20	00:10:21	Did you see that?
109	00:10:21	00:10:24	I'm telling you, she just moved.
110	00:10:24	00:10:31	Sometimes, when you see the body of someone you know, someone you've seen move before, you want them to move.
111	00:10:31	00:10:32	That's not her.
112	00:10:32	00:10:33	This lady's too thin.
113	00:10:33	00:10:35	That's not her skin, either.
114	00:10:35	00:10:36	My aunt always wore sunblock.
115	00:10:36	00:10:38	Dry mouth.
116	00:10:38	00:10:40	Diaphoresis.
117	00:10:40	00:10:41	Red eyes, dilated pupils.
118	00:10:42	00:10:43	Huh?
119	00:10:43	00:10:45	It means you're high.
120	00:10:46	00:10:48	I got to go.
121	00:10:48	00:10:50	We'd like you to stay.
122	00:10:52	00:10:54	Where are you living these days, Connor?
123	00:10:55	00:10:58	At the YMCA off Industrial, near the underpass.
124	00:10:58	00:10:59	Nice.
125	00:10:59	00:11:01	How's work?
126	00:11:02	00:11:03	I don't have a job.
127	00:11:03	00:11:04	I used to.
128	00:11:04	00:11:08	Yeah. Yeah, two years ago, your aunt reported a pearl necklace stolen.
129	00:11:08	00:11:10	You were busted trying to hock it at a pawn shop.
130	00:11:10	00:11:13	She dropped those charges.
131	00:11:13	00:11:14	Oh, sure.
132	00:11:14	00:11:15	Anything for her favorite nephew.
133	00:11:15	00:11:17	And what have you done for her?
134	00:11:17	00:11:19	She was lying in a coat closet for over a month.
135	00:11:19	00:11:20	You didn't call.
136	00:11:20	00:11:22	You didn't stop by.
137	00:11:22	00:11:24	I don't call her much.
138	00:11:24	00:11:27	We only have dinner on holidays.
139	00:11:27	00:11:31	Whenever she sees me, it makes her kind of sad.
140	00:11:31	00:11:33	Do you get the munchies?
141	00:11:33	00:11:35	When?
142	00:11:35	00:11:36	When you're high.
143	00:11:39	00:11:42	Do you like cake?
144	00:11:42	00:11:44	No, I go for burgers.
145	00:11:44	00:11:45	Sonic.
146	00:11:46	00:11:50	How would you like to make a dental impression for us?
147	00:11:50	00:11:52	I'll do whatever you guys want.
148	00:11:52	00:11:53	Hey, Rich.
149	00:11:53	00:11:55	Whatcha got for me?
150	00:11:55	00:11:58	Found this somewhere where it didn't belong. ( paper crinkling )
151	00:11:58	00:12:00	Unregistered. No prints.
152	00:12:00	00:12:02	Huh. Sweet piece. Mm-hmm.
153	00:12:02	00:12:04	.32 Beretta Tomcat.
154	00:12:04	00:12:08	Titanium frame, stainless steel barrel and slide.
155	00:12:08	00:12:09	Super lightweight.
156	00:12:09	00:12:11	Yeah, light enough for a five year old to use.
157	00:12:12	00:12:13	Ouch.
158	00:12:13	00:12:14	He's okay. Thank God.
159	00:12:14	00:12:15	Good.
160	00:12:16	00:12:17	.32 caliber.
161	00:12:17	00:12:19	Not many of these in circulation.
162	00:12:19	00:12:21	Well, that's a good thing.
163	00:12:21	00:12:22	Potentially.
164	00:12:22	00:12:23	( ammo rattling ) Okay.
165	00:12:25	00:12:27	Here we go. Okay.
166	00:12:37	00:12:39	Two shots!
167	00:13:01	00:13:04	There's showing up for work and there's doing your job.
168	00:13:04	00:13:06	Warrick brought in a .32 auto Coroner's bullet last week.
169	00:13:06	00:13:09	D.B. in Maslow Park.
170	00:13:09	00:13:12	You just found the murder weapon.
171	00:13:12	00:13:14	Frank Maddox.
172	00:13:14	00:13:16	47-year-old white male.
173	00:13:16	00:13:18	He's a bounty hunter.
174	00:13:18	00:13:22	Single .32 round in the side of his head.
175	00:13:22	00:13:24	Bruises on his face and chest.
176	00:13:24	00:13:26	Autopsy ruled those premortem. At least a day old.
177	00:13:26	00:13:30	It was a close shot, noncontact, downward angle.
178	00:13:30	00:13:32	No primer residue on the hands.
179	00:13:32	00:13:34	00 a.m.
180	00:13:34	00:13:36	00 a.m.
181	00:13:36	00:13:37	A lot of wind...
182	00:13:37	00:13:38	Warrick, your notes are great.
183	00:13:39	00:13:40	Let the case speak for itself.
184	00:13:42	00:13:44	I got to go see my mummy.
185	00:13:52	00:13:55	You know, I could've sworn I heard Grissom telling you to do this.
186	00:13:55	00:13:57	Yeah?
187	00:13:57	00:13:58	You know what rolls downhill?
188	00:13:58	00:14:01	Apparently bloated fingertips.
189	00:14:01	00:14:04	Come on, you got a lot of new skills to master.
190	00:14:04	00:14:07	Field work's a little messier than your test tubes and your GCMS.
191	00:14:07	00:14:10	Yeah, and a lot less accurate.
192	00:14:10	00:14:13	One continuous motion, nice and easy.
193	00:14:17	00:14:20	That's not bad.
194	00:14:20	00:14:21	Keep practicing.
195	00:14:21	00:14:22	Nine more to go.
196	00:14:24	00:14:26	Hey. Hey.
197	00:14:26	00:14:27	I heard about your mummy in the closet.
198	00:14:27	00:14:29	Very cool.
199	00:14:29	00:14:30	Yeah, and we get a 406 in Henderson.
200	00:14:30	00:14:31	Want to trade?
201	00:14:31	00:14:33	Nothing spells excitement like a B and E.
202	00:14:45	00:14:46	Who is it?
203	00:14:46	00:14:48	Las Vegas Police, sir.
204	00:14:48	00:14:50	Hey.
205	00:14:50	00:14:53	We received a phone call from a neighbor about a break in.
206	00:14:54	00:14:55	Yeah, yeah, I'm, uh, sorry, officers.
207	00:14:55	00:14:57	There's been a misunderstanding.
208	00:14:57	00:15:02	My daughter, she had some friends over tonight without my permission, and, um, they started drinking.
209	00:15:02	00:15:03	They got out of control.
210	00:15:03	00:15:04	They broke some stuff.
211	00:15:04	00:15:09	A couple of windows, but, uh, you know, we got it under control, we're cleaning it all up.
212	00:15:09	00:15:10	So I apologize for the trouble.
213	00:15:10	00:15:11	No trouble at all, sir.
214	00:15:11	00:15:13	You have a good night now.
215	00:15:13	00:15:14	Thanks.
216	00:15:16	00:15:19	To protect and serve.
217	00:15:20	00:15:22	Are you boys ready for softball on Sunday?
218	00:15:22	00:15:24	Ready to kick your ass, Stokes.
219	00:15:24	00:15:25	See you back at the lab.
220	00:15:25	00:15:27	All right. You're ready to kiss my what?
221	00:15:27	00:15:28	You heard me.
222	00:15:39	00:15:41	I need to go to the hospital.
223	00:15:41	00:15:43	Please.
224	00:15:45	00:15:47	Suzanna, if you were sexually assaulted...
225	00:15:48	00:15:49	It was a party.
226	00:15:49	00:15:50	It just got out of control.
227	00:15:50	00:15:55	All I need is an AIDS test and a morning after pill.
228	00:15:55	00:15:57	Date rape is still rape.
229	00:15:57	00:16:01	Thank you for clearing that up.
230	00:16:02	00:16:03	Hey.
231	00:16:03	00:16:05	Hi.
232	00:16:09	00:16:10	Does she...?
233	00:16:10	00:16:13	Does she have to be in here for this?
234	00:16:13	00:16:15	No.
235	00:16:15	00:16:16	Bye.
236	00:16:16	00:16:18	Thank you.
237	00:16:18	00:16:20	Okay.
238	00:16:20	00:16:23	Go ahead and put this on, okay?
239	00:16:29	00:16:31	We're going to need full-body photographs.
240	00:16:31	00:16:34	If she can't talk, the kit's going to have to do it for her.
241	00:16:34	00:16:35	Okay.
242	00:16:52	00:16:54	Your, uh, mummy prints.
243	00:16:58	00:17:01	Warrick's getting sloppy.
244	00:17:01	00:17:04	Yeah, someone should really have a talk with that guy.
245	00:17:06	00:17:08	What's that?
246	00:17:09	00:17:12	Dessert.
247	00:17:14	00:17:17	Look, I thought we were done.
248	00:17:17	00:17:21	Well, sir, we need a list of all the kids who were here tonight.
249	00:17:21	00:17:22	Why?
250	00:17:22	00:17:26	Mrs. Kirkwood, Mr. Kirkwood, your daughter has been raped.
251	00:17:27	00:17:29	What did she tell you?
252	00:17:33	00:17:35	We're going to need to search the premises.
253	00:17:35	00:17:37	You can't It's my house.
254	00:17:37	00:17:39	You don't have a choice. We have a warrant.
255	00:17:40	00:17:44	I'm going to have to ask you folks to step outside. Thank you.
256	00:17:48	00:17:49	I'll take the girl's room.
257	00:17:49	00:17:51	Yeah, I'll take the master.
258	00:19:49	00:19:52	So, how do we know we're dealing with the same suspect?
259	00:19:52	00:19:54	We don't.
260	00:19:54	00:19:57	Table against the closet door, chair shoved under the knob.
261	00:19:57	00:19:58	It is the same M.O.
262	00:19:58	00:20:00	Any connections between the victims?
263	00:20:00	00:20:03	Well, both victims were left alive, we think.
264	00:20:03	00:20:08	I mean, the old lady's death was probably unintentional, and the girl's rape was...
265	00:20:08	00:20:10	Crime of opportunity?
266	00:20:11	00:20:14	If you're out to rob somebody's house, why would you do it when they're home?
267	00:20:14	00:20:19	The difference between burglary and home invasion-- infliction of terror.
268	00:20:19	00:20:20	Talk to the cops?
269	00:20:20	00:20:23	Say a word, and I'll kill you.
270	00:20:23	00:20:25	I'll kill you, okay?
271	00:20:25	00:20:28	Bad guys leave, fear just stays behind.
272	00:20:31	00:20:33	Maslow Park.
273	00:20:33	00:20:36	All fun and games till the sun goes down.
274	00:20:36	00:20:40	00 a.m.
275	00:20:40	00:20:42	Like shooting fish in a barrel.
276	00:20:42	00:20:47	Almost guaranteed to run into one of his skips or some lowlife who knows where they are.
277	00:20:47	00:20:50	Well, apparently, someone found him first.
278	00:20:57	00:21:00	Hunter becomes the hunted.
279	00:21:01	00:21:04	A dozen perfect dump sites within a mile of here.
280	00:21:04	00:21:09	So, how does the gun end up across town in the hands of a five-year-old boy?
281	00:21:09	00:21:10	Drive and dump.
282	00:21:11	00:21:13	Doesn't make any sense.
283	00:21:25	00:21:27	You never make it easy, do you?
284	00:21:27	00:21:29	The center whorls look similar.
285	00:21:31	00:21:33	Can you generate a composite?
286	00:21:33	00:21:35	Well, it's all about gestalt.
287	00:21:36	00:21:39	When the whole of the pattern is greater than the sum of its parts.
288	00:22:35	00:22:38	Once I pulled details, I shrank it back down to 100%.
289	00:22:38	00:22:40	Here's the thing.
290	00:22:40	00:22:43	Looks like the bite came from behind.
291	00:22:43	00:22:46	Well, it was probably easier to subdue her in that position.
292	00:22:52	00:22:54	You okay?
293	00:22:54	00:22:56	Yeah.
294	00:22:59	00:23:04	The occlusal plane looks the same.
295	00:23:04	00:23:06	And the lateral incisor overlaps the canine...
296	00:23:08	00:23:10	...in both cases.
297	00:23:10	00:23:11	Same person.
298	00:23:12	00:23:14	Definitely not the old lady's nephew.
299	00:23:15	00:23:16	Hey, hey.
300	00:23:16	00:23:18	Two partials equal one slimeball.
301	00:23:18	00:23:20	Jacqui got a hit through AFIS.
302	00:23:20	00:23:23	The guy with the closet fixation is Steve Jansson.
303	00:23:23	00:23:25	Let's see if he has an oral fixation as well.
304	00:23:25	00:23:27	Little Stevie Jansson.
305	00:23:27	00:23:31	How was the Home of the Good Shepherd, Steve?
306	00:23:31	00:23:34	Mac and cheese was aces.
307	00:23:34	00:23:36	Juvie offenses don't mean squat.
308	00:23:36	00:23:38	My record-- it's been expunged.
309	00:23:38	00:23:40	Expunged, huh?
310	00:23:40	00:23:42	So, what's this crap you're pulling now?
311	00:23:42	00:23:46	Two crime scenes, two prints-- both yours.
312	00:23:46	00:23:51	And looking at your adult record, this makes strike two and three with one pitch.
313	00:23:51	00:23:52	That's a real time-saver for us.
314	00:23:52	00:23:55	I don't know what you're talking about.
315	00:23:55	00:23:56	Madeline Foster.
316	00:23:56	00:23:57	The Kirkwoods.
317	00:24:01	00:24:04	I do work for them sometimes.
318	00:24:05	00:24:06	Odd jobs.
319	00:24:06	00:24:11	So, if we asked the Kirkwoods, they'd say you were their handyman, huh?
320	00:24:11	00:24:14	Go ahead.
321	00:24:14	00:24:15	Ask them.
322	00:24:15	00:24:19	You always help yourself to something sweet while you work?
323	00:24:21	00:24:23	Bite it.
324	00:24:23	00:24:25	I'm saying it now, and I'm saying it loud.
325	00:24:25	00:24:26	I will bring Terrango to justice.
326	00:24:26	00:24:30	What makes you think you'll succeed where so many others have failed?
327	00:24:31	00:24:32	Failure's not an option.
328	00:24:32	00:24:33	It never has been.
329	00:24:33	00:24:35	You feeling me, Terrango?
330	00:24:35	00:24:38	You can keep on running, but I will keep coming.
331	00:24:38	00:24:39	I will never stop.
332	00:24:39	00:24:41	Them's fightin' words.
333	00:24:41	00:24:42	Did he get his man?
334	00:24:42	00:24:43	Actually, no.
335	00:24:43	00:24:48	Terrango killed two more people before another recovery agent picked him up in Texas.
336	00:24:48	00:24:50	Well, that probably hurt business.
337	00:24:51	00:24:52	Oh, yeah, it did.
338	00:24:52	00:24:56	After that case, his recovery rate went down practically to zero.
339	00:25:01	00:25:03	What about suicide?
340	00:25:03	00:25:04	No.
341	00:25:04	00:25:07	It's a non-contact wound at a downward angle.
342	00:25:07	00:25:08	It's a textbook murder.
343	00:25:08	00:25:09	Maybe too textbook.
344	00:25:09	00:25:11	A bounty hunter would know how to fake it.
345	00:25:11	00:25:14	Let's check out his right sleeve.
346	00:25:14	00:25:15	Very odd-- unbuttoned.
347	00:25:15	00:25:16	It's pulled way down.
348	00:25:16	00:25:19	It would explain why there weren't any prints on the gun.
349	00:25:24	00:25:27	Doesn't explain how the gun left the scene.
350	00:25:27	00:25:29	Maybe someone found it and grabbed it up.
351	00:25:29	00:25:31	Just to toss it in suburbia a week later?
352	00:25:31	00:25:33	We're always looking for a weapon.
353	00:25:33	00:25:36	You'd think it'd be easier when the weapon finds us.
354	00:25:36	00:25:38	What's in the scope?
355	00:25:38	00:25:39	It's polypropylene film.
356	00:25:40	00:25:41	It was found in the trigger guard.
357	00:25:42	00:25:45	It's ribbon, for wrapping presents and...
358	00:26:24	00:26:26	You got a theory?
359	00:26:26	00:26:28	You got ten bucks?
360	00:26:29	00:26:30	Yeah.
361	00:26:34	00:26:38	Jansson's dental impression is consistent with the bite mark on the girl's shoulder.
362	00:26:38	00:26:40	Consistent, but not conclusive.
363	00:26:40	00:26:42	I spoke to Mr. Kirkwood.
364	00:26:42	00:26:45	He wouldn't confirm or deny Jansson's handyman story.
365	00:26:45	00:26:47	He said he couldn't remember.
366	00:26:47	00:26:48	And without that, uh...
367	00:26:48	00:26:50	Hey, guys, we're screwed.
368	00:26:50	00:26:53	The semen from the rape kit doesn't belong to Steve Jansson.
369	00:26:53	00:26:54	No hits off CODIS either.
370	00:26:54	00:26:56	There was more than one guy.
371	00:26:56	00:26:57	She was gang-raped.
372	00:27:02	00:27:04	This gets cheerier by the minute.
373	00:27:04	00:27:06	Jansson's never going to roll over on his partner.
374	00:27:06	00:27:08	They're going to do it again.
375	00:27:08	00:27:09	Yeah.
376	00:27:09	00:27:11	We've given them no reason to stop.
377	00:27:20	00:27:21	Hi.
378	00:27:21	00:27:23	My name's Gil Grissom.
379	00:27:23	00:27:26	I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
380	00:27:28	00:27:30	Suzanna, I said I'd get it.
381	00:27:31	00:27:33	What do you want?
382	00:27:33	00:27:37	I already told the police I have nothing more to say.
383	00:27:37	00:27:38	I think you do.
384	00:27:38	00:27:43	And I need you to speak for someone who can't speak for herself.
385	00:27:43	00:27:45	Another victim.
386	00:27:45	00:27:47	I don't care about another victim.
387	00:27:50	00:27:51	Suzanna, please.
388	00:27:53	00:27:55	Look, we know that two men broke into your house.
389	00:27:56	00:28:00	We have one suspect in custody, but we can't hold him unless you talk to us.
390	00:28:00	00:28:01	I can't help you.
391	00:28:01	00:28:02	I'm shutting the door now.
392	00:28:02	00:28:04	Mr. Kirkwood, I've done all that I can.
393	00:28:06	00:28:09	I need what you saw.
394	00:28:11	00:28:15	Mr. Grissom, do you have a wife, children?
395	00:28:17	00:28:18	No.
396	00:28:18	00:28:21	Then you can't possibly understand how I feel.
397	00:28:21	00:28:24	All I am to you is a folder in a drawer.
398	00:28:24	00:28:26	And if I had a wife and children...
399	00:28:26	00:28:27	Then you wouldn't be here.
400	00:28:29	00:28:30	I can't help you.
401	00:28:35	00:28:36	Man...
402	00:28:37	00:28:38	Mrs. Kirkwood was a Hoover.
403	00:28:38	00:28:40	She even bleached the sheets.
404	00:28:40	00:28:41	You know what I don't get?
405	00:28:41	00:28:42	How do they get in?
406	00:28:42	00:28:45	There's no sign of forced entry at either scene.
407	00:28:45	00:28:47	Ring the doorbell; that usually seems to work.
408	00:28:50	00:28:52	Hey, hey, hey. What?
409	00:28:52	00:28:54	What is that you just threw over there?
410	00:28:54	00:28:57	Leftovers, I guess.
411	00:28:57	00:29:03	You know that piece of half-eaten shark with cake that Gris and I found at the old lady Maddie's house?
412	00:29:03	00:29:05	This is from the same restaurant.
413	00:29:05	00:29:07	Links the victims.
414	00:29:12	00:29:14	Same night as the home invasion.
415	00:29:14	00:29:16	Signed by Mrs. Kirkwood.
416	00:29:17	00:29:20	Dinner for one.
417	00:29:20	00:29:24	Single women, dining alone-- easy targets.
418	00:29:25	00:29:27	All you have to do is follow them home.
419	00:29:30	00:29:32	Same restaurant...
420	00:29:32	00:29:35	Same waiter?
421	00:29:39	00:29:41	Uh...
422	00:29:41	00:29:43	sure, they're regulars.
423	00:29:43	00:29:48	I haven't seen, uh, Maddie in a while, but Mrs. K. comes in every Thursday while her daughter's at soccer practice.
424	00:29:48	00:29:50	Well, you know all your customers this well?
425	00:29:50	00:29:52	I try to chat up the ones that come in alone.
426	00:29:52	00:29:53	I feel bad for 'em.
427	00:29:53	00:29:55	So both women came in alone?
428	00:29:56	00:29:58	Every week.
429	00:29:58	00:30:00	Where were you after your shift on Thursday night?
430	00:30:00	00:30:03	Oh, uh... I was best man at my friend's wedding.
431	00:30:04	00:30:05	The Luxor has that new wedding chapel.
432	00:30:06	00:30:08	You get it at a discount if you use it on a weekday.
433	00:30:08	00:30:10	I can give you a number if you...
434	00:30:10	00:30:12	Down, boy.
435	00:30:12	00:30:13	Thanks.
436	00:30:13	00:30:14	Sure.
437	00:30:16	00:30:21	I kind of doubt that a clean-cut guy like Ryan is hanging out with snaggletooth Steve.
438	00:30:21	00:30:24	No, but I'd bet somebody here was.
439	00:30:40	00:30:41	Hi. Hi.
440	00:30:41	00:30:43	You here every day?
441	00:30:43	00:30:45	Seven days a week, till the sun goes down.
442	00:30:45	00:30:47	I got a wife, a kid, and 2.3 dogs to support.
443	00:30:47	00:30:50	Do you recognize this man?
444	00:30:50	00:30:51	Oh, yeah.
445	00:30:51	00:30:53	He was here a few days ago.
446	00:30:53	00:30:55	A little bigger than my average customer.
447	00:30:55	00:30:56	Did he buy any balloons?
448	00:30:56	00:30:59	Four big reds.
449	00:31:04	00:31:06	I'll take what he bought.
450	00:31:31	00:31:35	So, we know Jansson's partner knew the customers at the restaurant.
451	00:31:35	00:31:39	Education, employment history and a driver's license are required for all employees.
452	00:31:39	00:31:42	I've made a timeline of Steve Jansson's illustrious life span.
453	00:31:42	00:31:45	Places he's lived, the places he's been arrested-- you know, the highlights.
454	00:31:46	00:31:48	You find any commonalities?
455	00:31:48	00:31:49	Well, Eric Shultz.
456	00:31:49	00:31:51	Lives in the same neighborhood.
457	00:31:51	00:31:52	Jose Cortez.
458	00:31:52	00:31:56	Worked at the Wilson Street Grill from '93 to '94.
459	00:31:56	00:32:03	But the busboy, Kelly James-- not only went to the same high school, but graduated from the same juvie center.
460	00:32:03	00:32:06	It's always nice when they come out worse than when they went in.
461	00:32:06	00:32:09	What do you think? That's our guy, right?
462	00:32:09	00:32:10	It's a connection.
463	00:32:11	00:32:12	It's not enough to compel DNA.
464	00:32:13	00:32:14	So we have nothing?
465	00:32:14	00:32:16	No, we have a name, and we know where he works.
466	00:32:17	00:32:22	I'll find out where he was the night the Kirkwoods were invaded. ( pager beeps )
467	00:32:42	00:32:44	Lineup's almost ready to go.
468	00:32:44	00:32:50	Listen, when she IDs Kelly James, we're going to need a DNA sample and an immediate hold, no bail.
469	00:32:50	00:32:52	He's not a flight risk.
470	00:32:52	00:32:53	He's a risk.
471	00:32:53	00:32:55	Hey, Suzanna.
472	00:32:58	00:33:02	Um, why don't we go hang out until they're ready for us?
473	00:33:02	00:33:05	We'll get a glass of water or something.
474	00:33:07	00:33:12	I'm really glad you decided to come today.
475	00:33:19	00:33:22	Do you... you want to hear something stupid?
476	00:33:24	00:33:25	Sure.
477	00:33:31	00:33:36	My boyfriend and I had been talking about having sex for a of couple months.
478	00:33:38	00:33:44	I always said no because I was afraid that my parents would find out.
479	00:33:56	00:33:58	Mr. Kirkwood, I'm sorry.
480	00:33:58	00:34:06	The other day, I thought you were saying that you wouldn't help me, and now I realize that you couldn't.
481	00:34:08	00:34:10	I never got a good look at them.
482	00:34:14	00:34:15	We're ready.
483	00:34:15	00:34:17	Can she come with me?
484	00:34:17	00:34:21	I already cleared it with the public defender.
485	00:34:24	00:34:26	She's 16.
486	00:34:26	00:34:34	I only had two jobs left-- teach her to think for herself, keep her safe.
487	00:34:36	00:34:39	I got one right.
488	00:34:39	00:34:43	Here's how this works There are five guys in a line.
489	00:34:43	00:34:49	We're going to ask each of them to step forward, turn to the side, and then face forward again.
490	00:34:49	00:34:53	Now, if you want a second look or you need more time, just let us know.
491	00:34:53	00:34:59	When you're ready to make a decision, write it down on this piece of paper.
492	00:34:59	00:35:02	Remember, you can see them, but they can't see you.
493	00:35:02	00:35:05	Okay?
494	00:35:05	00:35:08	He already knows it's me.
495	00:35:08	00:35:10	Suzanna, you can do this.
496	00:35:10	00:35:12	I know you can.
497	00:35:18	00:35:20	Okay.
498	00:35:22	00:35:26	Number One, please step forward.
499	00:35:26	00:35:29	Turn to the left.
500	00:35:29	00:35:32	Step back.
501	00:35:32	00:35:35	Number Two, step forward. Turn to your left.
502	00:35:35	00:35:38	You know, people say you never forget.
503	00:35:38	00:35:43	Truth is... you do forget.
504	00:35:43	00:35:45	And then you remember.
505	00:35:45	00:35:48	It makes it worse.
506	00:35:48	00:35:55	It was like, uh, it's like my brain... doesn't know where to put it.
507	00:36:02	00:36:06	You know, it must've run through a million times in my mind...
508	00:36:06	00:36:08	Somebody breaks in. I get a baseball bat.
509	00:36:08	00:36:11	Get everybody out the back door.
510	00:36:11	00:36:14	Call the cops. My family's safe.
511	00:36:19	00:36:21	And I just stood there...
512	00:36:26	00:36:29	Number Four, step forward.
513	00:36:44	00:36:45	Turn to your left.
514	00:36:52	00:36:53	No!
515	00:36:56	00:36:57	Suzanna! My baby!
516	00:37:01	00:37:13	And when Suzanna was a little girl, Linda made me put those, um, the child-proof locks on all the kitchen cabinets.
517	00:37:13	00:37:15	I complained.
518	00:37:15	00:37:17	You know what she said to me?
519	00:37:17	00:37:25	She said, uh, The least we can do is make her safe in her own house.
520	00:37:29	00:37:32	Mr. Kirkwood...
521	00:37:32	00:37:34	you didn't do anything wrong.
522	00:37:39	00:37:41	Baby.
523	00:37:42	00:37:46	( sobbing quietly ) Oh, it's okay, it's okay. Shh.
524	00:37:51	00:37:53	She froze up. She couldn't do it.
525	00:37:53	00:37:55	Her reaction should be enough.
526	00:37:55	00:37:56	What do you think?
527	00:37:56	00:38:01	Well, we've got enough to hold this Jansson kid, but the other guy...
528	00:38:01	00:38:05	Unless she writes a number down, there's nothing we can do.
529	00:38:11	00:38:12	Hey.
530	00:38:12	00:38:14	I'm sorry to hear about your case.
531	00:38:15	00:38:18	We were so close, you don't even know.
532	00:38:18	00:38:21	Well, he'll be back. We'll get him eventually.
533	00:38:21	00:38:22	Yeah.
534	00:38:23	00:38:25	Want to go for a ride?
535	00:38:26	00:38:29	Probably safer than anything else I had planned. Yeah.
536	00:38:32	00:38:36	Frank Maddox-- badass bounty hunter on his way down.
537	00:38:36	00:38:38	Loses his rep, loses his edge...
538	00:38:38	00:38:40	Loses his manhood.
539	00:38:40	00:38:43	Guess he thought he had nothing left to live for.
540	00:38:44	00:38:46	going out with his boots on.
541	00:38:46	00:38:51	He picks a known hot spot, and waits until it gets dark.
542	00:38:51	00:38:56	Angles the gun down... ( gunshot )
543	00:38:56	00:39:00	And the balloons make it look like murder.
544	00:39:00	00:39:03	On a windy night, a balloon can go for miles.
545	00:39:03	00:39:05	Until...
546	00:39:15	00:39:20	You leave the city to get away from crime, and guns fall out of the sky.
547	00:39:35	00:39:37	Get your kit.
