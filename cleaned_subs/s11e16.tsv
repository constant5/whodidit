0	00:00:02	00:00:10	Tonight there are still many questions looming in the wake of serial killer Nate Haskell's escape from police custody.
1	00:00:10	00:00:27	Haskell, the convicted Dick and Jane Killer, was being transported in a prison van when an apparent coconspirator smashed her vehicle into the prison convoy, fatally shooting two corrections officers and another female accomplice,before she and Haskell then fled the scene.
2	00:00:27	00:00:32	Police continue to ask the public for any information they may have regarding the case.
3	00:00:32	00:00:36	Don't turn it off on my account. Nothing I haven't seen, nothing I haven't heard.
4	00:00:37	00:00:39	You have any word?
5	00:00:39	00:00:40	I got nothing.
6	00:00:40	00:00:43	Nothing? There's been sightings from here to Poughkeepsie-- nothing substantial, you know.
7	00:00:43	00:00:47	Man like Haskell gets on the loose, people get shook, start seeing things.
8	00:00:47	00:00:50	We got nationwide BOLOs, NCICs have been alerted.
9	00:00:50	00:00:51	That's how we catch criminals.
10	00:00:51	00:00:57	Haskell's a different matter, Jim. Hey, Ray, there are a lot of people putting in a lot of time on this.
11	00:00:57	00:00:59	He'll make a move, we'll get him.
12	00:00:59	00:01:03	And until he makes a mistake, I guess we just satisfy ourselves picking up bodies, right?
13	00:01:05	00:01:07	Hey, buddy, you okay?
14	00:01:07	00:01:09	We should call 911.
15	00:01:14	00:01:15	Let's get some tape out. Everybody back!
16	00:01:15	00:01:19	I'm not getting any pulse. Hook him up to the EKG.
17	00:01:19	00:01:22	Not viable. Flatliner.
18	00:01:22	00:01:23	No signs of life.
19	00:01:23	00:01:25	Affirm, a 419. Roll coroner.
20	00:01:27	00:01:28	No apparent injuries.
21	00:01:28	00:01:30	I don't smell any booze.
22	00:01:30	00:01:33	Liver temp is 98 degrees.
23	00:01:33	00:01:35	Been dead less than an hour.
24	00:01:35	00:01:42	Okay, let's bag him.
25	00:02:22	00:02:23	I'm busy, okay?
26	00:02:23	00:02:26	No, no, no, I can't talk about this now.
27	00:02:26	00:02:31	Well, I-I tried to talk about it this morning, but I'm busy now.
28	00:02:31	00:02:34	Uh-huh. I'm sorry.
29	00:02:34	00:02:37	Did you say I act like my job is life and death?
30	00:02:37	00:02:40	Well, excuse me, my, my job is just death.
31	00:02:40	00:02:41	Yeah, that's right.
32	00:02:41	00:02:44	60 hours a week, plus unpaid overtime worth of death.
33	00:02:44	00:02:45	Which reminds me, I have a customer waiting.
34	00:02:45	00:02:48	I gotta get back to work.
35	00:02:48	00:02:50	No, I'll call you later.
36	00:03:14	00:03:17	David? David?
37	00:03:17	00:03:21	David, you're zoning out again.
38	00:03:21	00:03:24	I-I'm back, Doc.
39	00:03:24	00:03:26	So let me get this straight.
40	00:03:26	00:03:31	You found a John Doe in his 20s on the pavement near the Strip, and you brought him here dead.
41	00:03:31	00:03:36	Yeah, I-I was about to take a sample of his vitreous fluid when he, uh...
42	00:03:36	00:03:37	Well, he just...
43	00:03:37	00:03:39	Decided to leave? Well...
44	00:03:39	00:03:42	Oh, so a dead guy just got up and left? Okay.
45	00:03:42	00:03:43	How'd you end up on the ground?
46	00:03:43	00:03:46	Well, I had to defend my domain.
47	00:03:46	00:03:49	Well, you put a hole in his liver. I think I'd call that a draw.
48	00:03:49	00:03:53	Were you able to get a fingerprint or a blood sample or anything we can use to I.D. the man?
49	00:03:53	00:03:58	No. No, I just had time to snap a few photos, take personal effects from his pockets.
50	00:03:58	00:03:59	There's no wallet.
51	00:03:59	00:04:02	Captain Brass, coroner's office has been cleared.
52	00:04:02	00:04:03	No suspect found.
53	00:04:05	00:04:08	Suspect has left the building.
54	00:04:12	00:04:14	Dead man walking.
55	00:04:49	00:04:52	Sweetie, I'm okay. I'm sorry, too, honey bunny.
56	00:04:52	00:04:54	I feel awful, Doc, but I swear the guy was dead.
57	00:04:54	00:04:55	Did you check respiration?
58	00:04:55	00:04:56	Yes! EKG?
59	00:04:56	00:04:58	I'm telling you, it was a flatline.
60	00:05:09	00:05:14	Sweat on the body bag where the dead man's palms would have been.
61	00:05:14	00:05:16	Dead men don't sweat, do they, Doctor?
62	00:05:16	00:05:18	About as often as they get up and walk away.
63	00:05:18	00:05:20	Have a trace of blood, as well.
64	00:05:20	00:05:22	That's from the liver stick puncture.
65	00:05:22	00:05:24	What'd you find in his pockets?
66	00:05:24	00:05:27	City bus pass. No particular route.
67	00:05:27	00:05:33	This old notebook, very well used, filled with all kinds of data.
68	00:05:33	00:05:37	Stonewall 1/14, day seven.
69	00:05:37	00:05:39	Number one-- Status quo.
70	00:05:39	00:05:43	Number two-- Moved from Falcon to Chameleon.
71	00:05:43	00:05:52	And then these last pages are written in a completely different hand, dated a week ago.
72	00:05:52	00:05:55	Making progress, feeling closer.
73	00:05:55	00:05:57	Hey, got some surveillance.
74	00:06:12	00:06:16	Dead rising, birds falling from the sky, fish dying in rivers.
75	00:06:16	00:06:19	Should we be looking for the Antichrist to make an appearance?
76	00:06:19	00:06:22	Haskell being on the loose is enough to fill our quota.
77	00:06:28	00:06:30	Coffee? Yes.
78	00:06:30	00:06:32	Thanks! No ambulance yet, huh?
79	00:06:32	00:06:33	Nope. Early bird gets the caffeine.
80	00:06:33	00:06:36	You said you have a DB with a head wound?
81	00:06:36	00:06:41	I do. Some of the shop owners around here complain about the homeless people being too at home in these alleys.
82	00:06:41	00:06:43	So I check on 'em from time to time.
83	00:06:43	00:06:46	Just how far a walk are we talking about? Right here.
84	00:06:46	00:06:47	Are you sure?
85	00:06:47	00:06:48	He was right here, dead!
86	00:06:48	00:06:50	I checked his pulse myself.
87	00:06:50	00:06:53	I'm not kidding you; he was here.
88	00:06:58	00:07:03	Well, we got a blood pool. You weren't dreaming.
89	00:07:06	00:07:08	Looks like he, uh, hit his head on the gutter spout?
90	00:07:08	00:07:10	Maybe he was intoxicated.
91	00:07:10	00:07:14	You know, heavily enough to suppress his heart rate, make him appear pulseless.
92	00:07:21	00:07:22	That's him.
93	00:07:22	00:07:26	Surveillance footage from the garage at the end of the alley where you found him...
94	00:07:26	00:07:27	and then lost him.
95	00:07:27	00:07:28	Captain, I swear.
96	00:07:28	00:07:32	Look, the good news for you is this isn't the first time this has happened today.
97	00:07:32	00:07:36	That's the second body that's just got up and walked away.
98	00:07:36	00:07:37	It's a zombie epidemic.
99	00:07:37	00:07:38	A zombie epidemic?
100	00:07:38	00:07:39	Is that how you're gonna characterize it?
101	00:07:39	00:07:42	Turn around and tell these guys we have a zombie epidemic in Las Vegas.
102	00:07:42	00:07:44	See how far you get.
103	00:07:44	00:07:45	Come on. (officers laughing)
104	00:07:45	00:07:48	Maybe you ought to keep that to yourself.
105	00:07:59	00:08:00	DMV facial recognition?
106	00:08:00	00:08:02	Yeah. Yeah, it's worth a shot.
107	00:08:02	00:08:07	You know, I considered calling the DMV. Half the people that work up there are the walking dead anyway.
108	00:08:07	00:08:09	Maybe they recognize this guy.
109	00:08:09	00:08:13	Uh, I got the DNA results on the blood found in the alley and the body bag.
110	00:08:13	00:08:14	Neither John Doe was in CODIS.
111	00:08:22	00:08:23	Hmm?
112	00:08:23	00:08:26	Yeah, Zombie DNA Index System.
113	00:08:28	00:08:29	He made me say that.
114	00:08:29	00:08:33	He also wants you to know that zombie blood is no different than regular human blood.
115	00:08:33	00:08:36	The potassium and glucose levels are consistent with the living.
116	00:08:36	00:08:37	That's all you have for us?
117	00:08:37	00:08:39	I ran tox, too, and both samples were clean.
118	00:08:39	00:08:41	Although, working with such minimal samples is fairly useless.
119	00:08:41	00:08:45	You know, brain-hungry zombies could say the same thing about Hodges.
120	00:08:45	00:08:47	Minimal sample.
121	00:08:47	00:08:48	Fairly useless.
122	00:08:48	00:08:48	Exactly.
123	00:09:24	00:09:35	I searched for combinations of the terms in morgue zombie's notebook, and discovered a Defense Department program called Stonewall that took place on the WLVU campus in the early '70s.
124	00:09:35	00:09:40	Psychological research. Found a schematic of the campus building that was used in the experiments.
125	00:09:40	00:09:43	Included some rooms code-named Falcon and Chameleon.
126	00:09:43	00:09:50	Researchers were exploring a variety of fringe psych concepts such as ESP, out-of-body experience.
127	00:09:50	00:09:53	Science fiction. Not if they help us defeat the commies.
128	00:09:53	00:09:59	One of the most notable psychologists involved was a man named Dr. Eliot Davis Aden.
129	00:10:02	00:10:04	EDA.
130	00:10:04	00:10:06	This probably belonged to him.
131	00:10:06	00:10:08	He's an interesting guy.
132	00:10:08	00:10:12	World-renowned psychoanalyst, but fell down the rabbit hole of psychedelic drugs.
133	00:10:12	00:10:17	Was dismissed by the scientific community, but not without one big, fat scandal.
134	00:10:17	00:10:22	Rumor has it that Dr. Aden had become a bit of a Dr. Feelgood for the student body.
135	00:10:22	00:10:27	At least until one of his students threw himself out of a fifth-story window, and the party came to an end.
136	00:10:27	00:10:30	He was banished by the university, but charges were never pressed.
137	00:10:30	00:10:33	So the government didn't want to step on the toes of someone who knew their secrets.
138	00:10:33	00:10:39	All right, so our morgue zombie is walking around with Dr. Aden's notebook. There's got to be a connection.
139	00:10:39	00:10:40	Is Aden still around?
140	00:10:40	00:10:42	He still receives a government pension check.
141	00:10:42	00:10:45	And I was able to track down the address where he receives it.
142	00:10:45	00:10:47	Hello, Doctor.
143	00:11:30	00:11:33	Casino's three miles further.
144	00:11:33	00:11:34	Dr. Aden?
145	00:11:34	00:11:38	Dr. Aden... Uh... we'd like to speak with you.
146	00:11:38	00:11:39	You got the wrong guy.
147	00:11:39	00:11:42	We're from the crime lab. We found something of yours.
148	00:11:47	00:11:50	Lying government bastards!
149	00:11:50	00:11:52	Ivory-tower turncoats!
150	00:11:52	00:11:59	Frat boy plays window Icarus, and the university throws my reputation out the window with him.
151	00:11:59	00:12:04	They claimed that all of my papers had been destroyed.
152	00:12:04	00:12:06	Banished me from university property.
153	00:12:06	00:12:10	It was a good way to cut me out of the green andthe glory.
154	00:12:10	00:12:13	It's Philo Farnsworth all over again!
155	00:12:13	00:12:15	I'm sorry. Where did you find this?
156	00:12:15	00:12:17	In the pocket of, uh, this young man.
157	00:12:17	00:12:18	Do you recognize him?
158	00:12:18	00:12:22	Uh-uh... He's dead?
159	00:12:22	00:12:25	He's obviously on an autopsy table.
160	00:12:25	00:12:28	Actually, the young man in question...
161	00:12:29	00:12:31	...arose.
162	00:12:33	00:12:37	The Lazarus myth made real?
163	00:12:38	00:12:42	Re-animation? This is getting more interesting.
164	00:12:42	00:12:43	It's, uh...
165	00:12:43	00:12:46	not as easy as you might think, bringing back the dead.
166	00:12:46	00:12:48	It's not work for neophytes.
167	00:12:48	00:12:50	Or the reckless. Or the timid.
168	00:12:50	00:12:57	Oh, sure, they can conjure up a cardiac spasm, or a momentary flash from the bioelectric system.
169	00:12:57	00:13:02	That's not the same as... Doctor, are you saying that you conducted re-animation experiments at Stonewall?
170	00:13:02	00:13:04	What's your clearance, soldier?
171	00:13:04	00:13:06	Uh... about five-nine.
172	00:13:06	00:13:09	Doctor, are those your notes from the re-animation experiments?
173	00:13:09	00:13:11	It's hard to say.
174	00:13:11	00:13:13	It's my writing.
175	00:13:13	00:13:16	I won a lot of awards for penmanship in third grade.
176	00:13:16	00:13:20	Of course, staying between the lines for me wasn't easy.
177	00:13:20	00:13:23	These... last entries.
178	00:13:23	00:13:25	It's not my handwriting.
179	00:13:25	00:13:30	Some vulture is perching on my giant shoulders.
180	00:13:30	00:13:33	Feasting on the carrion of my discoveries.
181	00:13:33	00:13:35	Treating the work as their own.
182	00:13:35	00:13:40	In your, um, re-animation experiments, Doctor, how far would you say you were able to get?
183	00:13:40	00:13:46	I had the Ithaca of that most profound mystery within my sights.
184	00:13:46	00:13:50	Could almost reach out and touch it.
185	00:13:50	00:13:52	But I saw the storm clouds gathering.
186	00:13:52	00:13:54	The maelstrom.
187	00:13:54	00:13:59	For those not wise enough to pull their sails in, certain destruction awaits.
188	00:13:59	00:14:03	I'm trying to say... this isn't good.
189	00:14:15	00:14:16	San Francisco girl, huh?
190	00:14:16	00:14:20	Left my heart, and half my cerebral cortex in Frisco.
191	00:14:20	00:14:22	You ever see The Dead play the Fillmore?
192	00:14:22	00:14:25	No, uh... too busy with the dead everywhere else.
193	00:14:25	00:14:26	Lucky you.
194	00:14:26	00:14:35	The research librarian said that your work was archived in a disused wing of one of the buildings, gave me the keys, but said enter at your own risk.
195	00:14:35	00:14:37	Preface fit for any worthwhile venture.
196	00:14:37	00:14:38	Where is it?
197	00:14:38	00:14:40	Lincoln Hall, room 317.
198	00:14:40	00:14:41	Right where I left it.
199	00:14:41	00:14:43	Lazy, lying bastards!
200	00:14:43	00:14:45	I really don't know, Conrad.
201	00:14:45	00:14:51	Maybe we need a new classification for this type of situation. D.O.-AWOL.
202	00:14:51	00:14:52	That was a joke!
203	00:14:52	00:14:54	Hey, Catherine. Later, Conrad.
204	00:14:54	00:14:57	I got a DMV facial recognition match on the morgue zombie.
205	00:14:57	00:14:59	Oh, Max Ferris. Mm-hmm.
206	00:14:59	00:15:02	Home address is on the WLVU campus, so I called the school.
207	00:15:02	00:15:04	He's a grad student in psychology.
208	00:15:04	00:15:05	Could be how he got Aden's notebook.
209	00:15:05	00:15:10	Yeah. I'll have Brass send a uniform to his place, trap his credit cards, see if we can track him down.
210	00:15:10	00:15:11	Nice.
211	00:15:12	00:15:14	We don't need a key. The lock's been busted out.
212	00:15:14	00:15:16	Easy. Easy, Doctor.
213	00:15:16	00:15:17	Easy, easy, easy.
214	00:15:17	00:15:19	We don't want to tamper with this.
215	00:15:19	00:15:21	This is all evidence.
216	00:15:26	00:15:27	This...
217	00:15:27	00:15:30	is my Library of Alexandria.
218	00:15:30	00:15:32	My trove of treasures.
219	00:15:32	00:15:38	I may have been banned bodily, but I wandered it nightly in my dreams.
220	00:15:38	00:15:41	Looks like someone's been doing some independent study here.
221	00:15:46	00:15:49	Doctor, are these... all yourpapers?
222	00:15:49	00:15:51	Do you know how many papers I wrote?
223	00:15:53	00:15:54	I'm asking.
224	00:15:54	00:15:56	How about we get back to you on that?
225	00:15:56	00:15:57	Hmm.
226	00:15:57	00:16:00	Reflections On Near-death Experiences.
227	00:16:00	00:16:03	Death As Gateway.
228	00:16:03	00:16:05	That was myWhiteAlbum.
229	00:16:05	00:16:08	They all appear to be on the same subject.
230	00:16:08	00:16:12	Sooner or later, all us chickens cross the road.
231	00:16:12	00:16:15	Now, aren't we all curious about what's on the other side?
232	00:16:15	00:16:18	Hey, Doc.
233	00:16:18	00:16:20	Your other subjects look untouched.
234	00:16:20	00:16:26	Whoever's been playing around with your papers was only interested in your research on death-related phenomena.
235	00:16:26	00:16:30	Making your acolyte's visit to the morgue... what?
236	00:16:30	00:16:32	A field trip?
237	00:16:32	00:16:36	In all my journeys to the other side, I never left this building.
238	00:16:36	00:16:40	DMT, ketamine, those were the only tickets I needed.
239	00:16:40	00:16:41	Hallucinogenic trips?
240	00:16:41	00:16:43	Better than a ride in a coroner's van?
241	00:16:46	00:16:48	Where is it?
242	00:16:50	00:16:52	Where isit?
243	00:16:52	00:16:53	What have they done to my song?
244	00:16:53	00:16:55	Dr. Aden!
245	00:16:58	00:17:02	So, Captain Klepto, you don't look like Max Ferris.
246	00:17:02	00:17:04	Guy was passed out on the sidewalk.
247	00:17:04	00:17:05	A real eyesore.
248	00:17:05	00:17:10	So it's your civic duty to steal his wallet, take his cash, and swipe his credit card?
249	00:17:10	00:17:12	I had that plastic for a whole day. I only used it once.
250	00:17:12	00:17:15	For a six-pack of beer, so...
251	00:17:15	00:17:17	Cleaning up the streets andfiscally responsible.
252	00:17:17	00:17:18	You ought to run for office.
253	00:17:18	00:17:19	Look out, Mayor Goodman.
254	00:17:19	00:17:22	Hey, I gave you his wallet and his...
255	00:17:22	00:17:26	phone...thing. What are the odds you'll just cut me loose, huh?
256	00:17:26	00:17:28	This is a phone?
257	00:17:28	00:17:30	Didn't look like any phone I'd seen, either.
258	00:17:30	00:17:32	But I'm a couple iPhones behind.
259	00:17:32	00:17:33	Yeah, I'll bet you are.
260	00:17:33	00:17:34	It's not a phone.
261	00:17:34	00:17:37	It's a wearable camcorder.
262	00:17:37	00:17:40	Wireless video camera and receiver.
263	00:17:40	00:17:41	Our morgue zombie was using it.
264	00:17:41	00:17:45	Well, grab some popcorn.
265	00:17:46	00:17:49	Tonight, we take the ultimate step.
266	00:17:49	00:17:52	Beyond our past journeys of the mind.
267	00:17:52	00:17:56	Tonight, we free ourselves from the physical plane.
268	00:17:56	00:18:00	Unspooling the mortal coil, we seek the mystery that lies beyond...
269	00:18:00	00:18:04	Hey, Discovery Channel, kill the speech and let's kill some brain cells.
270	00:18:04	00:18:07	This guy on the left-- his clothing matches the description of our alley zombie.
271	00:18:07	00:18:10	It's a dead man's party.
272	00:18:10	00:18:11	Except the third person looks like a woman.
273	00:18:11	00:18:13	How could they do this?
274	00:18:13	00:18:14	What have they done?
275	00:18:14	00:18:17	If they've given it to some health club...
276	00:18:17	00:18:19	Dr. Aden, slow down.
277	00:18:19	00:18:21	Dude. You going to tell us what we're taking?
278	00:18:21	00:18:24	No need to add baggage to your trip.
279	00:18:24	00:18:25	Trust me, Kurt.
280	00:18:25	00:18:26	It's going to be an adventure.
281	00:18:26	00:18:30	It's time to put your cameras on.
282	00:18:30	00:18:32	See you on re-entry.
283	00:18:35	00:18:36	Godspeed, Alice.
284	00:18:38	00:18:42	Max's friends Kurt and Alice.
285	00:18:42	00:18:46	Maybe we can get access to Max's university email account; check his contacts.
286	00:18:46	00:18:47	See who his co-pilots were.
287	00:18:47	00:18:49	Yeah.
288	00:18:59	00:19:02	Angelfish. Triggerfish.
289	00:19:02	00:19:05	Blue-ringed octopus.
290	00:19:05	00:19:07	All poisonous.
291	00:19:07	00:19:08	All alive.
292	00:19:08	00:19:12	Someone has been in here on a regular basis.
293	00:19:12	00:19:14	20 minutes after ingestion.
294	00:19:14	00:19:17	Effects are manifesting.
295	00:19:20	00:19:26	So Max has made his way to the Strip. He's at the plaza by the Tangiers.
296	00:19:26	00:19:29	Increasing numbness of the mouth.
297	00:19:29	00:19:33	S... Speech is becoming difficult.
298	00:19:33	00:19:37	Numbness spreading.
299	00:19:38	00:19:41	That hum.
300	00:19:41	00:19:44	The fish tank filter.
301	00:19:44	00:19:46	No, no, it's another harmonic.
302	00:20:00	00:20:03	She's here!
303	00:20:03	00:20:04	Oh, my...
304	00:20:04	00:20:07	Santa Maria,myNautilus!
305	00:20:07	00:20:11	The vessel of all my dreams.
306	00:20:11	00:20:15	Dr. Aden!
307	00:20:15	00:20:17	That's not Max Ferris.
308	00:20:17	00:20:18	That's our alley zombie.
309	00:20:18	00:20:20	De-animated.
310	00:20:29	00:20:33	The good doctor is content to wait in the hall. He hasn't had this much excitement since Altamont.
311	00:20:33	00:20:34	Or so he says.
312	00:20:34	00:20:36	Police and coroners are on their way.
313	00:20:36	00:20:38	Pulled the victim's wallet. Kurt Dawson.
314	00:20:38	00:20:43	Lived near campus, but his student ID expired about a year ago.
315	00:20:43	00:20:44	Dropped out of school.
316	00:20:44	00:20:46	Or dropped out of reality.
317	00:20:46	00:20:47	A sensory deprivation tank.
318	00:20:49	00:20:52	Did you ever see that movie Altered States?
319	00:20:52	00:20:53	Oh. Yeah. My mom took me.
320	00:20:53	00:20:56	She found it therapeutic, calming.
321	00:20:56	00:20:57	Says it all.
322	00:20:57	00:21:00	I saw it with some really good buds. Go, Dr. Ray.
323	00:21:00	00:21:02	I know. I only talk like a square.
324	00:21:02	00:21:10	Tank water's highly salinated; kept at body temp so the user floats in complete silence and darkness.
325	00:21:10	00:21:12	Blocking out all earthly stimuli.
326	00:21:14	00:21:19	You know, in the movie Altered States, William Hurt went into the tank naked.
327	00:21:19	00:21:26	To strip the self down to one's primitive, disembodied being is how you free the mind, allowing it to venture into other realms.
328	00:21:26	00:21:29	You wouldn't want to go venturing in ten pounds of wet clothes and sneakers.
329	00:21:30	00:21:33	Maybe the tank wasn't his idea.
330	00:21:33	00:21:37	I noticed some faint bruising that started to develop on Kurt's back and shoulder.
331	00:21:37	00:21:40	So, I snapped some infrared photos.
332	00:21:40	00:21:42	Hand marks. He was held down.
333	00:21:42	00:21:44	That's one way to drown in just ten inches of water.
334	00:21:44	00:21:46	So drowning is COD?
335	00:21:46	00:21:51	Heavy, edematous lungs, and fluid in his sphenoid sinus make it pretty clear.
336	00:21:51	00:21:53	I thought maybe you'd start chaining them down.
337	00:21:53	00:21:57	Although yanking out vital organs is a good way to keep the clients.
338	00:21:57	00:21:59	Henry.
339	00:21:59	00:22:03	Right. Um, found trace of Tetrodotoxin-- TTX-- in his system.
340	00:22:03	00:22:08	It's a naturally occurring poison, 1,200 times more toxic than cyanide.
341	00:22:08	00:22:11	It's present in a variety of sea creatures.
342	00:22:11	00:22:16	The toxin blocks sodium channels, blacking out the body's nervous system.
343	00:22:16	00:22:22	A dose the size of a pinhead can kill, and short of killing, it can completely paralyze a person for hours.
344	00:22:22	00:22:32	Considering his condition in that alley, I checked out the half-life table for TTX, and the current level of toxin in him would be consistent with a dose of two milligrams 16 hours ago.
345	00:22:32	00:22:37	Enough to paralyze, suppress heartbeat and breathing, and get him mistaken for dead.
346	00:22:37	00:22:42	There was a fish tank with some poisonous specimens in the same room we found him in.
347	00:22:42	00:22:44	Could the toxins have been extracted from them? Sure.
348	00:22:44	00:22:46	With some sophisticated biochem resources.
349	00:22:46	00:22:52	Although there were two other substances present in his system-- LSD and cannabis.
350	00:22:52	00:22:56	Body was frozen, mind was ablaze.
351	00:22:56	00:22:58	I've been there.
352	00:22:58	00:23:00	This one's actually dead.
353	00:23:00	00:23:02	Congratulations. You're batting .500.
354	00:23:02	00:23:05	Yeah, great for a hitter, bad for pronouncing death.
355	00:23:06	00:23:08	Let me see your EKG.
356	00:23:11	00:23:13	What are you looking for, Doc?
357	00:23:13	00:23:23	Your zombie from the Strip was under the influence of a paralytic, which we would have known if you'd had the gain on this unit correctly calibrated, which it's not.
358	00:23:23	00:23:25	The way you've got it set, it wouldn't pick up my heartbeat.
359	00:23:25	00:23:27	I'd be a flat-liner.
360	00:23:27	00:23:29	You're lucky you're not benched.
361	00:23:29	00:23:35	Misdiagnose the undead again, put my assistant in harm's way, and you'll find yourself unemployed.
362	00:23:43	00:23:47	Footprints in salt water leading towards the door.
363	00:23:47	00:23:51	The vic was wearing sneakers, size eights.
364	00:23:51	00:23:55	Yeah, well, these feet are at least size 11 or 12.
365	00:23:55	00:23:57	Maybe his pal Max came back here first.
366	00:24:04	00:24:06	I've got some light blue fibers here.
367	00:24:06	00:24:10	Same as the T-shirt Max Ferris was wearing in the morgue.
368	00:24:10	00:24:11	So...
369	00:24:11	00:24:19	Max makes a break from the coroner's office, comes here, dumps his clothes, gets in the tank to decompress.
370	00:24:19	00:24:20	And Kurt Dawson shows up.
371	00:24:20	00:24:23	They get into some sort of drug-induced fight.
372	00:24:28	00:24:32	Max wins and walks out of here.
373	00:24:43	00:24:44	Hey, Sara.
374	00:24:44	00:24:45	Hmm?
375	00:24:45	00:24:48	Looks like Kurt lost his camera in the fight.
376	00:24:48	00:24:55	LSD and Tetrodotoxin-- voodoo powder-- curious combination.
377	00:24:55	00:24:59	To paralyze yourself in order to free yourself...
378	00:24:59	00:25:04	Well, what kind of state of mind would that produce in an individual-- this cocktail?
379	00:25:04	00:25:07	There's an entire spectrum of possibilities.
380	00:25:07	00:25:11	Blazing, manic lucidity, to oppressive darkness.
381	00:25:11	00:25:16	Designer drugs-- one size does not fit all.
382	00:25:16	00:25:21	Could this cocktail produce, in certain individuals, uncontrollable rage, say?
383	00:25:21	00:25:23	Why do you ask?
384	00:25:23	00:25:25	Well, one of our young explorers killed the other.
385	00:25:25	00:25:31	Well, I would have to know more about the particulars of the situation.
386	00:25:31	00:25:35	There's no fighting in the war room, Dr. Strangelove.
387	00:25:35	00:25:38	I want you to look at something.
388	00:25:38	00:25:40	...beyond our past journeys of the mind.
389	00:25:40	00:25:43	Tonight, we free ourselves from the physical plane.
390	00:25:43	00:25:48	Unspooling the mortal coil, we seek the mystery that lies beyond.
391	00:25:48	00:25:52	Hey, Discovery Channel, kill the speech and let's kill some brain cells.
392	00:25:52	00:25:55	Dude, are you going to tell us what we're taking?
393	00:25:55	00:25:58	No need to add baggage to your trip.
394	00:25:58	00:25:59	Flag on the play.
395	00:25:59	00:26:02	This young Columbus didn't prepare his crew.
396	00:26:02	00:26:05	He knew what the toxins would induce.
397	00:26:05	00:26:12	There's a vast difference between leading others into the beyond, and throwing them into it unwittingly.
398	00:26:12	00:26:17	To some, that's sinister science, and could inspire rage and fury.
399	00:26:17	00:26:23	So, Kurt, not knowing what he was taking, survives the paralyzing nightmare.
400	00:26:23	00:26:26	Comes back to confront Max.
401	00:26:26	00:26:29	They fight. Max kills Kurt.
402	00:26:29	00:26:35	Yes. The reckless master kills the wronged squire.
403	00:26:35	00:26:37	Sounds like a role you're not unfamiliar with.
404	00:26:37	00:26:41	Max was modeling himself after you, Dr. Aden.
405	00:26:41	00:26:42	You and your work.
406	00:26:42	00:26:48	And here, you see, he sent his friends Alice and Kurt, unwittingly as you said, into the fire.
407	00:26:48	00:26:54	Probably felt like it was a... a worthy sacrifice.
408	00:26:54	00:26:57	Knowledge demands its payment.
409	00:26:57	00:27:01	It's always nice when somebody picks up the bill for you, though.
410	00:27:04	00:27:07	Went through Kurt Dawson's e-mail accounts.
411	00:27:07	00:27:13	Found a number of messages exchanged between him, Max Ferris and another WLVU student, Alice Katsu.
412	00:27:13	00:27:14	Alice from the video.
413	00:27:14	00:27:16	Yeah. Biochem major.
414	00:27:16	00:27:19	And like Kurt, she seemed to be under Max's spell.
415	00:27:19	00:27:26	Agreeing to his every experimental whim, late night meetings in the abandoned lab, rambling discussions on the afterlife.
416	00:27:26	00:27:28	Well, we know what happened to Max's other friend.
417	00:27:28	00:27:29	We need to find Alice.
418	00:27:29	00:27:31	Do you have any earthly contact info on her?
419	00:27:31	00:27:35	So, Mr. Katsu, when was the last time you saw your sister?
420	00:27:35	00:27:36	Three days ago.
421	00:27:36	00:27:37	It's just Alice and me here.
422	00:27:37	00:27:42	When she's at school and I'm at work sometimes we go a couple of days without even bumping into each other.
423	00:27:42	00:27:44	Even when she's here, she's quiet.
424	00:27:44	00:27:47	Sometimes, it feels like having a ghost in the house.
425	00:27:55	00:27:57	Mom liked jelly beans.
426	00:27:57	00:28:00	It's a Shinto shrine-- offering for the dead.
427	00:28:00	00:28:03	Alice even plucked out the black ones.
428	00:28:09	00:28:18	She's got some academic honors awards from the past few semesters, but an academic probation letter from just a month ago.
429	00:28:18	00:28:22	A card from her mom's funeral five months ago.
430	00:28:22	00:28:23	Doesn't take a detective.
431	00:28:23	00:28:25	Mom's death took a toll.
432	00:28:28	00:28:30	Ooh, another one of Dr. Aden's notebooks.
433	00:28:37	00:28:42	Question of crossing over physically versus mentally.
434	00:28:42	00:28:43	Are they inextricably linked?
435	00:28:46	00:28:50	She took a picture of Mom's grave every day.
436	00:28:50	00:28:52	Capturing the change in light and seasons.
437	00:28:52	00:28:55	Trying to shape something living out of the dead.
438	00:28:56	00:29:04	I think, while Max Ferris dosed himself to explore the mysteries of the afterlife, and Kurt was out for a good time, Alice...
439	00:29:04	00:29:06	Was traveling in search of someone.
440	00:29:06	00:29:10	Maybe we'll find Alice if we look in the same direction she was looking.
441	00:29:17	00:29:20	Groundskeeper said it was right around here somewhere.
442	00:29:24	00:29:26	I don't think they're going anywhere, Mitch.
443	00:29:26	00:29:28	Yeah, right.
444	00:29:31	00:29:34	Hey.
445	00:29:35	00:29:38	Alice?
446	00:29:45	00:29:46	Max?
447	00:29:50	00:29:51	Max.
448	00:29:55	00:29:57	Whoa!
449	00:29:57	00:29:59	Down. On your knees.
450	00:30:02	00:30:04	I thought she'd be here.
451	00:30:04	00:30:05	Max, you're crashing from a bad trip.
452	00:30:05	00:30:07	We need to get you to a hospital.
453	00:30:08	00:30:10	Stop, Max!
454	00:30:10	00:30:11	Stop!
455	00:30:16	00:30:19	Stop! Max!
456	00:30:26	00:30:28	Oh, my God!
457	00:30:33	00:30:35	No pulse.
458	00:30:35	00:30:37	Stand back, sir.
459	00:30:37	00:30:40	Dr. Aden said this was going to end badly.
460	00:30:40	00:30:42	We have two dead.
461	00:30:42	00:30:44	Let's hope there's still time for Alice.
462	00:31:57	00:32:05	The notebook I found in Alice Katsu's room is a match to Dr. Aden's handwriting, but the ink looked fresh, so I tested it.
463	00:32:05	00:32:10	It is a date-tag match to a formula that's only been around a couple of years.
464	00:32:10	00:32:13	Which means Dr. Aden wrote those notes recently.
465	00:32:13	00:32:16	Right. The notebook was not among his archived papers.
466	00:32:16	00:32:18	So how did Alice get it?
467	00:32:18	00:32:19	From the doctor himself.
468	00:32:19	00:32:22	He and Alice were e-mail buddies.
469	00:32:22	00:32:23	She initiated contact five months ago.
470	00:32:23	00:32:26	When her mother died. Hmm.
471	00:32:26	00:32:28	But Aden is not exactly advertising on bus benches.
472	00:32:28	00:32:31	Alice saw an anonymous commenter on a Web site about the doctor's past work.
473	00:32:31	00:32:35	She kind of felt like Mr. Anonymous knew a little bit too much.
474	00:32:35	00:32:41	So she e-mails, Dear sir, I'm convinced by your brilliant insights that you are Dr. Aden himself.
475	00:32:41	00:32:46	I'm a great admirer of your courageous research into the afterlife.
476	00:32:46	00:32:48	I want to follow in your footsteps.
477	00:32:48	00:32:53	He was quick to respond, Glad to have an acolyte, and encouraged her to find more of them.
478	00:32:53	00:32:56	Max and Kurt.
479	00:32:56	00:32:59	And we thought Max was driving the bus, but it was Alice.
480	00:32:59	00:33:01	Hey, you guys.
481	00:33:01	00:33:04	I got something for you to see.
482	00:33:04	00:33:10	I was scanning through through Kurt Dawson's video and I noticed something strange.
483	00:33:11	00:33:15	So, here, Kurt's just wandering campus.
484	00:33:15	00:33:17	Then this happens.
485	00:33:19	00:33:21	Some kind of interference.
486	00:33:21	00:33:23	Yeah, Kurt's receiver picked up a signal from another camera.
487	00:33:23	00:33:29	I'm working on isolating the competing image, but in the meantime, I managed to pull a few frames.
488	00:33:29	00:33:30	Well, those are women's shoes.
489	00:33:30	00:33:32	Are we looking through Alice's camera?
490	00:33:32	00:33:37	She must have been in close proximity to Kurt, if his receiver picked up her feet.
491	00:33:37	00:33:38	Where is she, and what's she doing?
492	00:33:38	00:33:41	It's hard to say. But check this out.
493	00:33:43	00:33:45	What, a car stopped for her?
494	00:33:45	00:33:47	It looks like an old Saab.
495	00:33:47	00:33:52	Hey, didn't Sara mention something about Dr. Aden driving an old dinosaur like that?
496	00:34:07	00:34:09	His car's gone.
497	00:34:09	00:34:13	Well, he's smart enough to lead us along, maybe he knew we were coming.
498	00:34:22	00:34:23	Dr. Aden!
499	00:34:33	00:34:34	Dr. Aden?!
500	00:34:34	00:34:36	Hello?!
501	00:34:42	00:34:44	Hello?!
502	00:34:49	00:34:53	Alice-- DMT-- Feb 10, 2011.
503	00:34:53	00:34:57	Alice-- Ketamine-- Jan 18, 2011.
504	00:34:57	00:34:59	They had a regular thing going.
505	00:35:03	00:35:05	This one's from yesterday.
506	00:35:07	00:35:10	Can you blink, Alice?
507	00:35:10	00:35:12	Come back.
508	00:35:12	00:35:15	Come back! Focus!
509	00:35:15	00:35:17	Tell me everything you've seen.
510	00:35:17	00:35:19	I need to know what you're seeing.
511	00:35:19	00:35:21	Let me in, Alice.
512	00:35:21	00:35:22	Let me in.
513	00:35:22	00:35:24	I'm not just your hookah-smoking caterpillar.
514	00:35:24	00:35:28	Tell me everything you've seen!
515	00:35:28	00:35:30	I need to know!
516	00:35:30	00:35:32	50 milligrams Tetrodotoxin, just a mouse click away.
517	00:35:32	00:35:35	Dr. Aden supplied the paralytic.
518	00:35:35	00:35:37	Alice just passed it around.
519	00:35:37	00:35:38	Mm-hmm.
520	00:35:38	00:35:40	I know you've arrived there, Alice.
521	00:35:40	00:35:41	Don't leave me behind!
522	00:35:41	00:35:44	Alice?!
523	00:35:46	00:35:47	The video camera.
524	00:35:55	00:35:56	This one's from today.
525	00:36:03	00:36:07	I've come to a crossroads.
526	00:36:09	00:36:11	The false path ends here.
527	00:36:11	00:36:14	I've flirted with the precipice for too long...
528	00:36:14	00:36:20	dispatching canaries into the celestial coal mine, but shying from the descent myself.
529	00:36:20	00:36:22	No longer.
530	00:36:22	00:36:29	I now slip not just the bonds of mind, but of body and spirit.
531	00:36:29	00:36:31	I'm ready to set sail...
532	00:36:31	00:36:33	unafraid.
533	00:36:36	00:36:40	Ithaca... I come.
534	00:36:52	00:36:53	You hear that?
535	00:36:53	00:36:55	Yeah.
536	00:36:59	00:37:00	Dr. Aden!
537	00:37:04	00:37:06	Doctor?
538	00:37:15	00:37:17	A faint pupil response.
539	00:37:17	00:37:20	He ingested the toxin around noon.
540	00:37:20	00:37:28	At his age, depriving his brain of oxygen for that period of time, he's in there, but I doubt he'll ever find his way back out.
541	00:37:28	00:37:31	What rabbit hole has Alice fallen down?
542	00:37:41	00:37:44	Nick, are you at the campus?
543	00:37:44	00:37:46	Aden's car's parked out front.
544	00:37:46	00:37:48	Campus police called it in.
545	00:37:48	00:37:51	I'm, uh, checking the building.
546	00:37:51	00:37:53	Copy.
547	00:39:16	00:39:18	Alice?
548	00:39:34	00:39:36	We've been looking for you.
549	00:39:36	00:39:39	I was looking for someone, too.
550	00:39:39	00:39:40	Your mother?
551	00:39:43	00:39:45	I found her!
552	00:39:52	00:39:56	I saw she was happy.
553	00:39:56	00:39:59	She told me she loved me.
554	00:40:03	00:40:05	Told me to go back.
555	00:40:15	00:40:16	Alice...
556	00:40:19	00:40:22	Where, where, where are Kurt and Max?
557	00:40:22	00:40:25	I have to tell them it was everything I thought I imagined.
558	00:40:25	00:40:28	I need to know if they found it, too.
559	00:40:28	00:40:32	They're not coming back, Alice.
560	00:40:40	00:40:44	Hallucinogens, neurotoxins and sensory deprivation.
561	00:40:44	00:40:50	These kids weren't really venturing to the other side.
562	00:40:50	00:40:53	You think they were just inducing chemical dreams?
563	00:40:53	00:40:56	All their visions could be explained by neuroscience.
564	00:40:56	00:40:57	Yeah. Don't get me wrong.
565	00:40:57	00:41:04	I'm sure Adam and Eve, when they stood over the first dead body, meditated on where his soul went.
566	00:41:04	00:41:07	Humans have always pondered whether there's an afterlife.
567	00:41:07	00:41:11	Yeah, if the dead could talk, we'd all have our answers, but no one's talking.
568	00:41:11	00:41:12	They haven't so far.
569	00:41:12	00:41:17	Which leads me to believe that part of life that is death is meant to be a mystery.
570	00:41:17	00:41:19	You don't sound very scientific, Doc.
571	00:41:19	00:41:23	I see people on the last, worst day of their lives.
572	00:41:23	00:41:26	And I'd like to believe they go to a better place.
573	00:41:26	00:41:28	I'd like to think I know you a little better than that.
574	00:41:28	00:41:33	Well, I was taught that in Sunday school long before medical school.
575	00:41:33	00:41:37	You know what I believe?
576	00:41:37	00:41:48	I believe that people that bring suffering and pain into this world should have it repaid to them tenfold, either in this world or the next one.
577	00:41:48	00:41:50	Careful.
578	00:41:50	00:41:56	Evil has a way of making friends with the good and dragging them into the darkness.
