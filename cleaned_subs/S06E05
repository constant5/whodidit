0	00:00:25	00:00:28	They came to... my house.
1	00:00:34	00:00:36	They had a fight.
2	00:00:49	00:00:52	They couldn't find what they were looking for.
3	00:01:45	00:01:47	Sheriff?
4	00:01:47	00:01:49	Who, uh... who called it in?
5	00:01:49	00:01:50	Anonymous 911.
6	00:01:50	00:01:55	Listen, we haven't had a murder in all of Lincoln County in ten years, let alone a quadruple.
7	00:01:55	00:01:57	Without the bodies, I can't confirm there was a murder.
8	00:01:57	00:02:01	No offense, Mr. Stokes, but did you see the amount of blood in that house?
9	00:02:01	00:02:03	Somebody's dead.
10	00:02:03	00:02:05	What do you know about the family?
11	00:02:05	00:02:07	Jude McBride-- great guy, stay-at-home dad.
12	00:02:07	00:02:09	Nina owns a local coffee shop.
13	00:02:09	00:02:11	Jeremy's a junior in high school, smart kid.
14	00:02:12	00:02:13	Ten-year-old daughter, Cassie.
15	00:02:13	00:02:15	Pip-squeak.
16	00:02:15	00:02:17	Sounds like all that's missing is the white picket fence, huh?
17	00:02:18	00:02:19	Yeah.
18	00:02:21	00:02:23	We don't even know where to start looking.
19	00:02:23	00:02:25	Begin at the beginning.
20	00:03:04	00:03:07	I loved my family.
21	00:03:56	00:03:59	Are we having a Taster's Choice moment?
22	00:03:59	00:04:01	Grissom called me from the airport.
23	00:04:01	00:04:04	He's teaching a Human Remains Recovery class at the body farm.
24	00:04:04	00:04:09	He said you needed backup, and I figure you needed coffee, but... looks like you already took care of it.
25	00:04:09	00:04:11	Oh, no. No, I didn't do it.
26	00:04:12	00:04:14	Coffeemaker's programmed to go on Monday through Friday.
27	00:04:14	00:04:18	So, somebody cleaned up Friday's coffee and reset it to go off today?
28	00:04:18	00:04:19	You'd have to be alive to do that.
29	00:04:19	00:04:23	Which means whatever happened here happened over the weekend.
30	00:04:23	00:04:28	Blood pools are dry, so, crime scene's at least 12 hours old.
31	00:04:28	00:04:36	There were at least three major blood events-- here... here... and up the stairs.
32	00:04:36	00:04:40	Without the bodies, we'll have to confirm the source of the blood through DNA comparison.
33	00:04:40	00:04:43	I'll collect toothbrushes, hairbrushes...
34	00:04:43	00:04:47	You know, it's possible it wasn't the family that died here.
35	00:04:47	00:04:53	The sheriff confirmed the McBrides' cars are parked out front, and their cell phones, car keys, wallets are all right there.
36	00:04:53	00:04:54	Can't get far without those.
37	00:04:54	00:04:56	Mm.
38	00:04:56	00:04:58	It would also seem to eliminate robbery as a motive.
39	00:04:58	00:04:59	Yeah.
40	00:05:03	00:05:05	What a mess.
41	00:05:05	00:05:07	If you're not gonna clean it up...
42	00:05:07	00:05:09	why take the bodies?
43	00:05:09	00:05:11	Yeah.
44	00:05:11	00:05:12	Well, I'm gonna start upstairs.
45	00:05:12	00:05:15	I'll take outside.
46	00:06:16	00:06:22	Based on their shoes, Dad wore a nine-and-a-half, Mom wore a nine.
47	00:06:22	00:06:25	Jeremy wore an eight-and-a-half, and Cassie wore a one.
48	00:06:25	00:06:30	There is that men's nine-and-a-half between blood pool number one and blood pool number two.
49	00:06:30	00:06:33	And the barefoot print on the stairs looks smaller.
50	00:06:33	00:06:36	Yeah, they're consistent with the mom, size nine.
51	00:06:37	00:06:39	No matches to Jeremy or Cassie, though.
52	00:06:39	00:06:41	Let's just assume they were shot.
53	00:06:41	00:06:44	Maybe they were shot first.
54	00:06:44	00:06:47	There's no blood to step in if you're first.
55	00:06:50	00:06:54	Or Mom could have grabbed Cassie up, try to take her away from it all.
56	00:06:55	00:06:56	Bullet penetrated both bodies.
57	00:06:58	00:07:00	Could explain why there are only three blood pools.
58	00:07:00	00:07:02	There are three other sets of shoeprints.
59	00:07:03	00:07:05	One size 12, two size 11.
60	00:07:05	00:07:11	Two of the sets appear to be going back and forth from the kitchen area to the front door.
61	00:07:11	00:07:15	One set, and only one set, headed upstairs for the bedrooms.
62	00:07:15	00:07:17	I'll go up there and see what I can find.
63	00:07:50	00:07:52	Sheriff Brackett...
64	00:07:52	00:07:55	did your deputies drive anything up here with a hitch?
65	00:07:55	00:07:58	No. Why?
66	00:07:58	00:08:00	I got an odd-sized tread here.
67	00:09:07	00:09:10	I hate the taste of that stuff.
68	00:09:31	00:09:33	I like Nancy Drew.
69	00:09:33	00:09:36	She always gets the bad guy.
70	00:09:57	00:09:59	I knew all my lines and Hansel's, too.
71	00:10:30	00:10:31	What is that?
72	00:10:31	00:10:34	If it's labeled correctly, it's, uh, Cassie's laugh.
73	00:11:20	00:11:23	Our man Jeremy's a bit of an entrepreneur here.
74	00:11:23	00:11:24	Oh, yeah? How's that?
75	00:11:24	00:11:26	He's trafficking in term papers.
76	00:11:26	00:11:30	Whatever happened to just flipping burgers, man?
77	00:11:53	00:11:55	I think I figured out when all this happened.
78	00:11:55	00:11:58	Cassie never got to her Saturday morning chores.
79	00:11:58	00:12:01	I was really into gold stars when I was a kid.
80	00:12:02	00:12:06	As opposed to now?
81	00:12:18	00:12:19	Whoa!
82	00:12:20	00:12:22	The McBrides must have a broken meter.
83	00:12:22	00:12:26	Even if they left every light on day and night, it wouldn't add up to $2,000.
84	00:12:26	00:12:29	( clears throat ) Maybe Brass can check it out.
85	00:12:29	00:12:32	I think this print dust is getting to me.
86	00:12:32	00:12:35	Would you mind finishing the fridge?
87	00:12:35	00:12:37	Do I get a gold star?
88	00:12:37	00:12:39	Ha-ha-ha.
89	00:13:21	00:13:23	Greg?
90	00:13:23	00:13:25	I found something.
91	00:13:28	00:13:30	Is it the bodies?
92	00:13:30	00:13:33	No.
93	00:13:38	00:13:42	Sweet Mary Jane.
94	00:13:42	00:13:44	The Emerald City.
95	00:13:44	00:13:47	Explains the $2,000 electric bill.
96	00:13:47	00:13:50	And all the footprints throughout the house.
97	00:13:50	00:13:52	It's a ganja graveyard.
98	00:13:53	00:13:54	No...
99	00:13:54	00:13:56	it's motive.
100	00:14:04	00:14:06	Whew...!
101	00:14:07	00:14:09	Looks like someone shot out the lock upstairs.
102	00:14:09	00:14:16	I found what looked like fragments of two bullets; they may be too M-and-D for a comparison, but I could probably get type and caliber.
103	00:14:16	00:14:18	Man.
104	00:14:18	00:14:24	If those suspects got everything on those lines, they made out like fat cats.
105	00:14:24	00:14:26	Yeah, but they were only interested in the dried stuff.
106	00:14:26	00:14:33	If this was a territory war, or something like that, wouldn't the dealer want to take the new growth, to try to put these guys out of business?
107	00:14:33	00:14:34	Maybe one of the customers got greedy.
108	00:14:34	00:14:38	Well, we're talking about getting rich, not getting high, you know?
109	00:14:38	00:14:41	And these dry ones go a lot faster than those.
110	00:14:41	00:14:43	The price of an ounce these days is anywhere from $200 to $400.
111	00:14:43	00:14:48	Don't you guys think it's weird that the McBrides did all this with two kids in the house?
112	00:14:48	00:14:52	Yeah, if they didn't care before, I bet they do now.
113	00:15:04	00:15:09	Well, we took some representative samples of the green plant material.
114	00:15:09	00:15:11	Okay, Ecklie's sending out a tech.
115	00:15:11	00:15:13	I'll include it with the other evidence.
116	00:15:13	00:15:16	Pioche P.D.'s going to hold on to the rest until we can secure it for bulk transport.
117	00:15:16	00:15:18	How's it going with the phone records?
118	00:15:18	00:15:22	00 p.m. Friday night.
119	00:15:22	00:15:25	I scrolled through Jude McBride's recent cell phone calls.
120	00:15:25	00:15:27	No activity all weekend until Sunday night.
121	00:15:27	00:15:31	Several incoming calls, all from the same number.
122	00:15:31	00:15:36	According to Pioche P.D. dispatch, it's the same number as the anonymous 911 call.
123	00:15:36	00:15:41	So I had the phone company cross-check it, Dr. Malcolm Parker.
124	00:15:41	00:15:44	I'll go check it out.
125	00:15:50	00:15:52	Be careful with those stitches, okay?
126	00:15:52	00:15:54	I just put them in a couple days ago.
127	00:15:54	00:15:55	Your mom will kill me if it scars.
128	00:15:55	00:15:58	Okay.
129	00:15:58	00:15:59	Sorry about that, guys. You had some questions?
130	00:16:00	00:16:03	You placed an anonymous 911 call Sunday night.
131	00:16:03	00:16:06	Said you were outside the McBrides' house and you could see blood in the entryway.
132	00:16:06	00:16:11	Right before that, you called Jude McBride's cell phone three times.
133	00:16:11	00:16:13	Late night house call...?
134	00:16:13	00:16:15	Dennis, do I have to answer that?
135	00:16:15	00:16:17	It looks worse if you don't.
136	00:16:17	00:16:21	Well, Jude and I have a standing Sunday night appointment.
137	00:16:22	00:16:23	For what?
138	00:16:24	00:16:27	You are aware that it's illegal.
139	00:16:27	00:16:32	Okay, look, I have no idea what went on out there, before I got there.
140	00:16:32	00:16:34	00.
141	00:16:34	00:16:35	Where are you guys?
142	00:16:35	00:16:38	I called 911.
143	00:16:38	00:16:40	I didn't leave my name, because...
144	00:16:40	00:16:42	because I didn't want to explain what I was doing there.
145	00:16:42	00:16:44	You and Jude are making me look like an idiot.
146	00:16:44	00:16:46	He's selling drugs, and you're buying them.
147	00:16:46	00:16:48	Tell me something, Malcolm.
148	00:16:48	00:16:50	Are you high when you treat my daughter?
149	00:16:50	00:16:52	Dennis, of course not.
150	00:16:52	00:16:53	And Jude was discreet.
151	00:16:53	00:16:55	He rarely sold to anybody in town.
152	00:16:55	00:16:58	He sent most of it out of state.
153	00:16:59	00:17:01	Dr. Parker, what size shoes do you wear?
154	00:17:01	00:17:02	What size shoe do I wear? A ten.
155	00:17:02	00:17:04	And where were you Friday night?
156	00:17:04	00:17:06	I was here, doing rounds.
157	00:17:11	00:17:13	Hello, there.
158	00:17:13	00:17:14	Hi.
159	00:17:14	00:17:16	Can I help you?
160	00:17:17	00:17:19	I'm Sage.
161	00:17:19	00:17:20	I'm looking for Nina.
162	00:17:20	00:17:22	Yeah? So am I.
163	00:17:22	00:17:26	She left work early Friday to see Jimmy Buffet in Tahoe.
164	00:17:26	00:17:28	But then she never showed up at the shop today.
165	00:17:28	00:17:30	And what was your name again?
166	00:17:30	00:17:31	Sage. Sage.
167	00:17:31	00:17:33	Okay, yeah, maybe you can help me out.
168	00:17:33	00:17:35	Um, the family, what do you know about them?
169	00:17:35	00:17:36	Are they having problems?
170	00:17:36	00:17:39	Marital problems, anything like that?
171	00:17:39	00:17:40	Are you kidding?
172	00:17:40	00:17:43	Jude and Nina had the marriage we all wanted.
173	00:17:43	00:17:44	Really?
174	00:17:45	00:17:52	You know, uh, your third eye is so open right now.
175	00:17:52	00:17:55	Are you having visions or hearing voices?
176	00:17:55	00:17:56	No.
177	00:17:56	00:17:58	I'm really sorry.
178	00:17:59	00:18:03	But you're radiating this crazy feminine energy.
179	00:18:03	00:18:05	Really. Mm-hmm.
180	00:18:05	00:18:07	Do you believe in past lives?
181	00:18:07	00:18:10	No, ma'am. How come?
182	00:18:10	00:18:14	Because I'm just trying to make it through this one.
183	00:18:16	00:18:19	I think you're doing pretty well.
184	00:18:30	00:18:31	Hey... Sage.
185	00:18:33	00:18:35	Thanks.
186	00:18:40	00:18:41	Hey, Nick.
187	00:18:41	00:18:45	Well, there's no hits off the fingerprints from the kitchen cabinets.
188	00:18:45	00:18:49	Dozens of unknowns, none of which were in the system-- no work cards, no prior crime.
189	00:18:49	00:18:54	So I expanded the search to other databases, and I did get one hit.
190	00:18:54	00:18:57	A Mark Horvatin.
191	00:18:57	00:19:00	17 years old, Junior ROTC.
192	00:19:00	00:19:02	His print was in the kitchen, but not in blood.
193	00:19:02	00:19:03	Could just be a friend.
194	00:19:05	00:19:07	That was nice, dude.
195	00:19:07	00:19:09	That was nice. You got smoked.
196	00:19:09	00:19:10	Hey, Mark!
197	00:19:10	00:19:12	Mark!
198	00:19:13	00:19:15	Hey, I'll catch up with you guys later.
199	00:19:18	00:19:19	Nice game Saturday.
200	00:19:19	00:19:20	Hey, Dennis.
201	00:19:21	00:19:23	Listen, we should probably go with Sheriff Brackett on this one.
202	00:19:23	00:19:26	Oh, okay, Sheriff.
203	00:19:26	00:19:30	This is Mr. Stokes from the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
204	00:19:33	00:19:34	What size shoe do you wear?
205	00:19:34	00:19:36	Twelve.
206	00:19:36	00:19:38	Can I see the bottom?
207	00:19:38	00:19:40	Should I get my dad?
208	00:19:40	00:19:42	No, we're just talking.
209	00:19:45	00:19:48	Oh, yeah, they're new, huh?
210	00:19:48	00:19:50	Yeah, I got them this weekend.
211	00:19:50	00:19:53	Huh.
212	00:19:54	00:19:58	You know, when I played ball, I used to stick all my gear in the trunk.
213	00:19:58	00:20:00	Yeah, well, this is just easier.
214	00:20:00	00:20:03	Parking lot still school property?
215	00:20:03	00:20:06	Yep.
216	00:20:06	00:20:08	Why don't you go ahead and pop the trunk for me?
217	00:20:10	00:20:11	Go ahead.
218	00:20:29	00:20:31	Daddy's garden was supposed to be a secret.
219	00:20:31	00:20:35	Someone must have told the secret.
220	00:20:37	00:20:39	This doesn't look good, Mark.
221	00:20:39	00:20:41	Not a lot of places you can get that much marijuana.
222	00:20:41	00:20:44	There's no way it could be a coincidence.
223	00:20:44	00:20:47	Tell me where the bodies are.
224	00:21:00	00:21:03	I'm not finding any blood in here.
225	00:21:03	00:21:07	Besides, four bodies would never fit inside this car.
226	00:21:07	00:21:11	You know, maybe, the pot was stolen after the fact.
227	00:21:11	00:21:13	Crime of opportunity?
228	00:21:14	00:21:15	What are you, his lawyer?
229	00:21:15	00:21:17	Whoever stole the pot...
230	00:21:18	00:21:22	...had a gun and shot the lock off the basement door.
231	00:21:22	00:21:27	03 Friday night.
232	00:21:27	00:21:28	Right in the window of the murders.
233	00:21:29	00:21:31	Hand that over to Sheriff Brackett.
234	00:21:31	00:21:33	He can run the account number.
235	00:21:47	00:21:53	I found this exact kind of gum in the driveway at the McBrides'.
236	00:21:56	00:22:00	This microscope I got from the high school is a joke.
237	00:22:00	00:22:03	How am I ever going to prove that this is the pot from the house?
238	00:22:04	00:22:06	Where's that evidence we collected?
239	00:22:20	00:22:25	All right, this is the bag from the house.
240	00:22:26	00:22:31	And this is the bag from the car.
241	00:22:33	00:22:35	The striations line up.
242	00:22:35	00:22:37	These bags are from the same roll.
243	00:22:37	00:22:38	Nicely done.
244	00:22:38	00:22:39	Fellas.
245	00:22:39	00:22:42	We have a little problem.
246	00:22:42	00:22:45	Mark's not talking, not even to pass the buck.
247	00:22:45	00:22:55	And his dad, Mark Sr., is a lawyer, and he's challenging our search and seizure, saying that even though we were on school grounds, we lacked probable cause to search personal property.
248	00:23:11	00:23:18	Blood pool closest to the front door, and the size nine-and-a-half shoe print...
249	00:23:18	00:23:21	both in Jeremy's blood.
250	00:23:23	00:23:24	Jeremy, what's going on?
251	00:23:27	00:23:29	Jude stepped in Jeremy's blood.
252	00:23:30	00:23:32	Blood pool number two.
253	00:23:32	00:23:36	In the hallway, between the foyer and the kitchen.
254	00:23:39	00:23:44	Nina's footprints, dual contribution, Jeremy and Jude.
255	00:23:48	00:23:51	Jude? Jeremy? Is everything okay?
256	00:23:53	00:23:54	Oh, my God!
257	00:23:54	00:23:55	Oh, my God!
258	00:23:55	00:23:56	Jeremy!
259	00:24:02	00:24:04	Blood pool number three...
260	00:24:06	00:24:08	...Nina's blood.
261	00:24:25	00:24:28	Yeah, Nick, I got the DNA results back.
262	00:24:28	00:24:32	Blood pools were confirmed for mom, dad and Jeremy.
263	00:24:32	00:24:37	None of the blood was Cassie's, so either her death was a bloodless crime...
264	00:24:37	00:24:39	Or they took her alive.
265	00:24:39	00:24:41	Thanks, Catherine.
266	00:24:41	00:24:47	How did Mark know where the pot was, if McBride was as discreet as Dr. Parker claims?
267	00:24:47	00:24:50	DNA confirmed to everyone but Cassie.
268	00:24:51	00:24:51	Interesting.
269	00:24:52	00:24:53	Mm-hmm.
270	00:24:53	00:24:55	Mark knew the pot was there because of Jeremy.
271	00:24:55	00:24:59	Come on, I'm sure Jeremy wasn't voted the most popular boy in school.
272	00:24:59	00:25:00	He's done everyone's term paper.
273	00:25:00	00:25:01	He's a nerd.
274	00:25:01	00:25:04	So you guys want to come over and hang out?
275	00:25:04	00:25:06	I could sell you some pot.
276	00:25:06	00:25:09	Now, where are you gonna score fresh herb?
277	00:25:09	00:25:11	My parents are going out of town.
278	00:25:11	00:25:12	My dad has pounds of it.
279	00:25:13	00:25:15	Yeah, so how does that end up a quadruple murder?
280	00:25:15	00:25:17	One of them was stupid enough to bring a gun.
281	00:25:17	00:25:18	I was talking to Tina the other night.
282	00:25:18	00:25:20	She said something to make me think.
283	00:25:20	00:25:21	Yoko Ono.
284	00:25:25	00:25:32	Tina's dad is a Doctor of Anthropology, so, one day, when she was a little girl, she asked her dad where on her body her anthropology was.
285	00:25:32	00:25:35	You know, he's a doctor.
286	00:25:35	00:25:38	Mark's dad's a lawyer.
287	00:25:38	00:25:40	Maybe Mark was thinking habeas corpus-- body of the crime?
288	00:25:40	00:25:43	Body of the crime is content of the case, not an actual body.
289	00:25:43	00:25:45	Yeah, but a kid could easily misinterpret.
290	00:25:45	00:25:48	Maybe he's thinking, no body, no crime, no crime, no punishment.
291	00:25:48	00:25:50	Does Yoko Ono want a job?
292	00:25:52	00:25:53	Morning.
293	00:25:53	00:25:54	Morning. Hello.
294	00:25:54	00:25:55	My wife made muffins.
295	00:25:56	00:25:56	Thank you.
296	00:25:57	00:25:57	You're welcome.
297	00:25:58	00:26:00	We got a lead on the ATM.
298	00:26:00	00:26:01	The account belongs to Jim Locke.
299	00:26:01	00:26:04	He's got a son named Peter, the same age as Mark.
300	00:26:04	00:26:06	We pulled some surveillance footage.
301	00:26:07	00:26:08	It's a little grainy, can't see much.
302	00:26:09	00:26:11	I'll give it over to Archie and see if he can clean it up. Thanks.
303	00:26:11	00:26:14	All right, I'll be in the car waiting when you guys are ready.
304	00:26:14	00:26:15	All right, thank you.
305	00:26:15	00:26:17	You feeling a little homesick there?
306	00:26:17	00:26:18	You want to draw straws?
307	00:26:20	00:26:21	No.
308	00:26:22	00:26:24	Call me if you need me.
309	00:26:24	00:26:26	All right.
310	00:26:26	00:26:29	All right, let's head over to Locke's house, and see what we can find.
311	00:26:35	00:26:35	You coming?
312	00:26:36	00:26:39	No... No, you go ahead, I'll catch up.
313	00:26:39	00:26:40	You think she's alive.
314	00:26:42	00:26:43	You don't?
315	00:26:44	00:26:46	None of her blood was found at the house.
316	00:26:46	00:26:51	I think she was drugged, and...
317	00:26:51	00:26:55	she was lucky if all they did after that was kill her.
318	00:26:55	00:26:57	I don't think she was drugged.
319	00:26:57	00:26:58	She's a smart little girl.
320	00:26:58	00:27:03	She hid that cough medicine in her shoe; that's like hiding green beans in your napkin, you know?
321	00:27:03	00:27:05	I hope you're right.
322	00:27:05	00:27:09	But everything in our experience tells us they're dead, all four of them.
323	00:27:09	00:27:10	Doesn't mean we just give up.
324	00:27:11	00:27:12	No one's giving up.
325	00:27:12	00:27:15	It's just that...
326	00:27:15	00:27:19	you're acting like you're going to rescue a person, not recover a body.
327	00:27:19	00:27:21	And on this job...
328	00:27:21	00:27:23	that's just not usually the case.
329	00:27:26	00:27:27	I was rescued.
330	00:27:29	00:27:32	It was not your day to die.
331	00:27:32	00:27:35	When it's your day, it's your day, you know?
332	00:27:37	00:27:40	I don't think it was Cassie's day.
333	00:27:50	00:27:53	That looks like the plant material I found in the McBrides' driveway.
334	00:27:53	00:27:56	And this looks like the same wheelbase as the tread you found.
335	00:27:58	00:28:02	We found something in Mark's car that we think might be Peter's.
336	00:28:02	00:28:04	Is that your account number?
337	00:28:04	00:28:05	Yes.
338	00:28:05	00:28:06	Does Peter have access to it?
339	00:28:07	00:28:08	Sure.
340	00:28:08	00:28:11	He has a limit, but he's never gone over it.
341	00:28:11	00:28:15	Mrs. Locke, when was the last time you took the boat out?
342	00:28:15	00:28:16	Friday night.
343	00:28:16	00:28:20	Peter and some of his friends took it out for one last hurrah before it gets too cold.
344	00:28:20	00:28:21	Do you know which friends?
345	00:28:21	00:28:23	I was already in bed. Sorry.
346	00:28:23	00:28:26	Do you mind if the CSIs take a look at it?
347	00:28:26	00:28:28	Sure.
348	00:28:28	00:28:30	Have the boys been drinking beer on the boat again?
349	00:29:03	00:29:06	Everyone told me I was the best Gretel ever.
350	00:29:30	00:29:34	My dad used to take me sailing when I was a kid.
351	00:29:34	00:29:37	Do you know what the inboard end of an anchor rope is called?
352	00:29:37	00:29:38	The bitter end.
353	00:29:46	00:29:49	This explains why we're not finding any blood.
354	00:30:02	00:30:03	Hey!
355	00:30:03	00:30:04	Hey!
356	00:30:04	00:30:06	Sara, did you find any gum on that boat?
357	00:30:07	00:30:09	Any gum at all-- wrapped, unwrapped-- anywhere?
358	00:30:09	00:30:11	Yeah...
359	00:30:11	00:30:12	How did you know that?
360	00:30:12	00:30:16	I think Cassie was on that boat-- alive.
361	00:30:16	00:30:18	I think she was leaving us a trail...
362	00:30:18	00:30:19	of gum, gum drops.
363	00:30:19	00:30:24	In the driveway, in the car, on the boat.
364	00:30:24	00:30:25	It's like Hansel and Gretel.
365	00:30:25	00:30:28	Half the pictures I've seen her in, she's chewing gum.
366	00:30:28	00:30:29	Nick, that's a bit of a stretch.
367	00:30:29	00:30:31	A lot of people chew gum.
368	00:30:31	00:30:33	You tell Sheriff Brackett I'll meet you at the station.
369	00:30:33	00:30:35	Peter, we know you were in Mark's car.
370	00:30:35	00:30:37	We found your ATM receipt.
371	00:30:37	00:30:41	We also know you guys took the boat out Friday night.
372	00:30:41	00:30:44	We know that there were three people involved.
373	00:30:45	00:30:47	Who was the third?
374	00:30:49	00:30:53	Pete, we found your print on a cough syrup bottle, underneath Cassie McBride's bed.
375	00:30:57	00:30:59	Your buddy Mark's not talking.
376	00:30:59	00:31:00	He's gonna pay for that.
377	00:31:01	00:31:03	Be smarter.
378	00:31:03	00:31:05	Do the right thing.
379	00:31:44	00:31:47	Dead bodies don't suck their thumbs.
380	00:32:15	00:32:16	How'd you hurt your hand?
381	00:32:16	00:32:18	What's the matter? She fight back?
382	00:32:18	00:32:19	You tried to drug her, but guess what?
383	00:32:19	00:32:20	She was too smart for you.
384	00:32:20	00:32:25	You coached the little girls' swim team, 'cause you liked to watch 'em in their bathing suits, is that it?
385	00:32:25	00:32:27	You're gonna answer me right now!
386	00:32:27	00:32:31	No more screwing around! Where is she?!
387	00:32:32	00:32:33	Where is she?
388	00:32:35	00:32:36	Where is she?
389	00:32:45	00:32:49	Okay, my guess is the guys stopped at the ATM to get cash for gas.
390	00:32:49	00:32:53	That's cash only, and Eddie over there says he filled the tank to the top Friday night.
391	00:32:53	00:32:55	Can I talk to you for a minute?
392	00:32:55	00:32:56	Sure, what's up?
393	00:32:56	00:32:58	I think I need to talk about what happened at the station.
394	00:32:58	00:33:01	Oh, yeah.
395	00:33:01	00:33:12	I'm slightly concerned about its effect on the case, but more than that, I'm concerned about the case's effect on you, Nick, and I'm absolutely sure that, six months ago, you wouldn't have lost it like that.
396	00:33:12	00:33:14	I know, I'm sorry.
397	00:33:14	00:33:16	I apologize for that.
398	00:33:16	00:33:18	How much gas was left?
399	00:33:19	00:33:20	Three-quarters of a tank.
400	00:33:20	00:33:31	Took an eighth to get out there, an eighth to get back, and according to the gas mileage, on the Lockes' boat, that would have been about three miles out from this launch point right here.
401	00:33:31	00:33:33	Come on.
402	00:33:34	00:33:37	Nick?
403	00:33:37	00:33:38	Yeah?
404	00:33:55	00:33:57	This is the three-mile mark.
405	00:34:25	00:34:32	I used to love going to the lake, but not anymore.
406	00:34:47	00:34:49	There's something there.
407	00:35:00	00:35:05	They killed my whole family.
408	00:35:27	00:35:29	Where's the fourth?
409	00:35:29	00:35:31	We only found three.
410	00:35:35	00:35:36	C.O.D.?
411	00:35:36	00:35:38	Gunshot wound to the chest.
412	00:35:38	00:35:42	Though it appears to have gone through his hand first.
413	00:35:43	00:35:45	Dad wrestled with the gun, huh?
414	00:35:48	00:35:50	Anything else?
415	00:35:50	00:35:52	Contact wound on the boy.
416	00:35:52	00:35:54	Shot up-close and personal.
417	00:35:54	00:35:57	Mom was shot twice in the back.
418	00:35:57	00:35:58	Not up-close.
419	00:36:00	00:36:02	Rinsed and ready for you.
420	00:36:07	00:36:10	.22... probably from a revolver.
421	00:36:10	00:36:12	Six shots.
422	00:36:13	00:36:14	Four in the bodies, two in the lock.
423	00:36:14	00:36:18	Well, that would explain why we didn't find Cassie's blood in the house.
424	00:36:18	00:36:19	They ran out of bullets.
425	00:36:20	00:36:24	Sara, the bullets pulled from the bodies were from a .22-caliber revolver.
426	00:36:24	00:36:26	IBIS bounced back a hit.
427	00:36:26	00:36:31	They were entered into IBIS from the Department of Wildlife, for shooting a deer with a small caliber handgun.
428	00:36:31	00:36:36	Firearm was returned to the owner-- a Chris Daniels from Pioche, Nevada.
429	00:36:43	00:36:44	Hey, Dennis, what's up?
430	00:36:44	00:36:46	Hey, just in time for steaks.
431	00:36:46	00:36:50	Mr. Daniels, do you, uh... do you own a .22 revolver?
432	00:36:50	00:36:52	You know the answer to that.
433	00:36:52	00:36:55	You cited it and fined me two hunting seasons ago.
434	00:36:55	00:36:58	Sir, I'm Sara Sidle from the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
435	00:36:58	00:37:01	It's evidence in a homicide investigation.
436	00:37:01	00:37:02	I'm going to need it.
437	00:37:02	00:37:04	Dad, how long on the steaks?
438	00:37:04	00:37:07	We're going to need to speak to Luke.
439	00:37:07	00:37:09	What did you do with my gun?
440	00:37:10	00:37:14	If you did anything to jeopardize that football scholarship of yours, you're done.
441	00:37:33	00:37:35	Duck your head.
442	00:37:41	00:37:45	Found this in his pocket when I patted him down.
443	00:37:45	00:37:47	Tested positive for blood.
444	00:37:49	00:37:50	As did these.
445	00:38:14	00:38:18	You just wanted to intimidate Jeremy, right?
446	00:38:18	00:38:20	Scare him a little?
447	00:38:24	00:38:29	But Mr. McBride was still home and he didn't scare so easily.
448	00:38:29	00:38:31	You guys have to go. My parents are still home.
449	00:38:31	00:38:33	Dude, I thought you said there were pounds of pot.
450	00:38:33	00:38:35	You guys got to get out, okay?
451	00:38:35	00:38:37	Please, just get out of here, all right?
452	00:38:37	00:38:39	Jeremy! Jeremy, what's going on? What the heck?
453	00:38:39	00:38:41	Jeremy, what's going on?
454	00:38:45	00:38:47	What the hell did you just do?
455	00:38:49	00:38:52	Mrs. McBride came downstairs, so you had to shoot her, too.
456	00:38:55	00:38:57	Peter went upstairs to deal with Cassie...
457	00:39:01	00:39:07	...while you and Mark bagged the pot and wrapped the bodies in garbage bags.
458	00:39:07	00:39:10	But... Peter couldn't do it.
459	00:39:13	00:39:16	He couldn't kill Cassie...
460	00:39:17	00:39:21	...so he tried to drug her.
461	00:39:21	00:39:31	You guys got in Mark's car, you went to the ATM, you got cash, you picked up Peter's boat, you went back to the McBrides' and you loaded the bodies onto the boat.
462	00:39:35	00:39:40	You were out of bullets, way out on the lake.
463	00:39:40	00:39:44	One small, loose end to tie up.
464	00:39:44	00:39:45	Bring her over here. No!
465	00:39:46	00:39:49	She can identify us! There's no way she's staying alive.
466	00:39:49	00:39:51	I said she was a strong swimmer.
467	00:39:52	00:39:55	I didn't say we could throw a drugged ten-year-old into the lake.
468	00:40:01	00:40:03	Did it make you feel like a man?
469	00:40:03	00:40:05	To kill a little girl?
470	00:40:54	00:40:56	Stop the boat. Stop the boat.
471	00:40:56	00:40:58	Let me out. Let me out.
472	00:41:54	00:41:56	Hi.
473	00:42:13	00:42:16	You're welcome, sweetie.
474	00:42:30	00:42:32	They're in Vegas.
475	00:42:48	00:42:50	Their bodies are in the coroner's office, honey.
476	00:42:56	00:42:59	Hey, Cassie...
477	00:42:59	00:43:03	I know when bad things happen, it's hard to remember.
478	00:43:05	00:43:13	But if I give you some details, do you think you could tell me the story of what happened to your family?
479	00:43:17	00:43:19	Okay.
480	00:43:19	00:43:21	Okay.
481	00:43:23	00:43:26	We'll go slow, okay?
482	00:43:30	00:43:35	And we'll just begin at the beginning, okay?
483	00:43:44	00:43:48	They came to... my house.
484	00:43:51	00:43:55	They had a fight.
485	00:43:55	00:43:58	They couldn't find what they were looking for.
486	00:44:04	00:44:05	I loved my family.
