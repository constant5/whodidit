0	00:00:11	00:00:12	Control, this is Air One.
1	00:00:12	00:00:14	I'm at the trailer park 402.
2	00:00:14	00:00:17	There's a large gas main construction fire.
3	00:00:48	00:00:51	Warrick, why don't you and I take the perimeter and work our way in.
4	00:00:51	00:00:53	All right. Greg, you're with us.
5	00:00:53	00:00:54	I'll start the sketch.
6	00:00:59	00:01:00	How you doing, Nick?
7	00:01:00	00:01:02	Above ground, Wilcox.
8	00:01:04	00:01:05	Would you like inside or out?
9	00:01:05	00:01:07	I'll take in.
10	00:01:07	00:01:08	We got two vics.
11	00:01:10	00:01:13	We think the girl is Selena March.
12	00:01:13	00:01:15	She owns the trailer.
13	00:01:15	00:01:16	What about the male?
14	00:01:16	00:01:18	Nothing yet.
15	00:01:18	00:01:22	This is a piece of the roof right here-- fiberglass and particle board.
16	00:01:24	00:01:26	These things weren't built to last.
17	00:01:26	00:01:28	They were built to burn.
18	00:01:28	00:01:30	This place is totaled.
19	00:01:30	00:01:31	The bed's collapsed.
20	00:01:31	00:01:33	My money's on meth lab.
21	00:01:33	00:01:38	You know, Metcalf, just because somebody lives in a trailer park, doesn't mean they're a meth cook.
22	00:01:38	00:01:40	You guys are a real pain in the ass, you know that?
23	00:01:41	00:01:42	Get used to it, pal.
24	00:02:17	00:02:20	I'm just having a little trouble understanding this because you all live so close together.
25	00:02:20	00:02:22	You mean none of you saw the explosion?
26	00:02:22	00:02:24	Uh, I heard it.
27	00:02:24	00:02:25	Well, good.
28	00:02:25	00:02:30	When I came out about five minutes later, the whole place was burnin' up.
29	00:02:30	00:02:31	Where do you live?
30	00:02:31	00:02:33	Right over there.
31	00:02:33	00:02:34	Uh-huh.
32	00:02:34	00:02:42	All right, let me get this straight-- you heard a blast like that coming from your neighbor's and it took you five minutes to poke your head out and see what was going on?
33	00:02:42	00:02:44	I was watching TV.
34	00:02:44	00:02:45	I'm sure he was drinking.
35	00:02:46	00:02:47	No, hang around, hang around.
36	00:02:48	00:02:49	Hey, hang around.
37	00:02:49	00:02:51	Did you find a man in Selena's trailer?
38	00:02:51	00:02:52	Now why would you ask that?
39	00:02:52	00:02:54	Was Selena a hooker?
40	00:02:54	00:02:56	I'm sure I don't know.
41	00:02:56	00:03:01	But one thing I do know, that's not Selena's car.
42	00:03:11	00:03:13	Yeah?
43	00:03:13	00:03:16	Catherine, we have a 4-19 off Industrial.
44	00:03:16	00:03:18	Do you mind handling it?
45	00:03:18	00:03:22	So you get the team back together only to break us apart again.
46	00:03:22	00:03:24	What kind of a perverse game are you playing here, Gil?
47	00:03:24	00:03:26	! Same one as usual.
48	00:03:26	00:03:27	Yeah, I'll cover it.
49	00:03:27	00:03:29	I'm taking Warrick.
50	00:03:40	00:03:42	Oh, hey, guys. Good to see you.
51	00:03:42	00:03:47	Hey, would you tell Nick I hope there's no hard feelings about that whole, you know, abduction thing.
52	00:03:48	00:03:49	He hasn't returned my calls.
53	00:03:49	00:03:51	He's been busy.
54	00:03:53	00:03:58	Squad car found her about a half hour ago-- no ID, but there's a lot of homeless in this area.
55	00:04:01	00:04:02	Looks like somebody took something to her head.
56	00:04:02	00:04:06	Didn't find a weapon, but my guys are still looking.
57	00:04:06	00:04:10	A shopping bag for a shirt, rubber boots and a G-string.
58	00:04:10	00:04:12	Homeless stripper?
59	00:04:12	00:04:15	Well, this is G-String Row, isn't it?
60	00:04:17	00:04:19	Why is there a ring on your ring finger?
61	00:04:19	00:04:22	Because I'm married.
62	00:04:22	00:04:24	What?
63	00:04:24	00:04:26	Congratulations.
64	00:04:26	00:04:28	How much did you pay her?
65	00:04:29	00:04:31	No, seriously, good luck with that, man.
66	00:04:31	00:04:36	I didn't even know you had a girlfriend. Oh, yeah, it's a girl I've been dating a couple months, Tina.
67	00:04:36	00:04:37	How long have you been married?
68	00:04:37	00:04:40	Since yesterday.
69	00:04:40	00:04:44	Did this, uh, drive-through wedding at Circus Circus Way, you know.
70	00:04:44	00:04:46	Fun, fun time.
71	00:04:46	00:04:48	Hey.
72	00:04:48	00:04:49	Sorry I'm late. Busy night.
73	00:04:51	00:04:53	We need a TOD, David.
74	00:04:55	00:04:56	Rigor's barely set, so not long.
75	00:04:57	00:04:58	Under four hours.
76	00:04:58	00:05:00	About as long as Warrick's been married.
77	00:05:00	00:05:02	You're married?
78	00:05:02	00:05:03	Congratulations.
79	00:05:03	00:05:05	Thanks.
80	00:05:05	00:05:07	Do you think she was dumped?
81	00:05:09	00:05:12	Lividity is consistent with the position of the body.
82	00:05:12	00:05:13	So it's highly unlikely.
83	00:05:13	00:05:15	All right.
84	00:05:15	00:05:16	I'll check out the strip clubs.
85	00:05:17	00:05:18	I'll go with you.
86	00:05:22	00:05:30	Well, there doesn't seem to be any drug-manufacturing supplies, a hot plate, fondue pot, gas stove, candles.
87	00:05:30	00:05:32	One leaky pipe's all it takes.
88	00:05:35	00:05:37	Which I haven't found yet.
89	00:05:37	00:05:43	Yeah, but even if you had, that would only explain the explosion in here, not the ruptured gas main outside.
90	00:05:43	00:05:44	Think I can help you with that.
91	00:05:45	00:05:48	I found this gas meter over by the main.
92	00:05:48	00:05:50	Trailer blows, this thing becomes a missile.
93	00:05:55	00:05:57	One explosion leads to another.
94	00:05:58	00:06:00	Yeah, but where did it all start?
95	00:06:00	00:06:03	Brass ran the plates on that Acura near the trailer.
96	00:06:03	00:06:05	It's registered to a Robert Durgee.
97	00:06:05	00:06:07	You get his photo from the DMV?
98	00:06:07	00:06:10	Confirmed as the vic-- Henderson address, mortgage broker.
99	00:06:10	00:06:11	Wife's name was on the insurance card.
100	00:06:11	00:06:12	She coming in?
101	00:06:12	00:06:13	She wasn't home.
102	00:06:13	00:06:16	Brass is tracking her down.
103	00:06:16	00:06:17	Excuse me, Mr. Grissom...
104	00:06:17	00:06:22	An officer brought this in off a call from Flora Nevada Nursery.
105	00:06:22	00:06:25	They thought it might have something to do with the Walter Gordon case.
106	00:06:36	00:06:38	Female's lungs were filled with soot.
107	00:06:38	00:06:40	COD is smoke inhalation.
108	00:06:40	00:06:43	Okay, that means the natural gas didn't suffocate her.
109	00:06:43	00:06:46	Explosion probably knocked her out before the fire even started.
110	00:06:46	00:06:49	Yeah, male didn't even last that long.
111	00:06:49	00:06:53	His lungs were clean, but he suffered fatal crushing injuries to his abdomen.
112	00:06:53	00:06:58	The pieces of debris that were on this guy's body were not heavy.
113	00:06:58	00:07:00	But the bed he was lying in collapsed.
114	00:07:00	00:07:02	Explosion could've done that.
115	00:07:08	00:07:09	Let's photo-enhance these bruises.
116	00:07:38	00:07:43	Yeah, yeah, the UV light's definitely bringing out the bruises underneath the skin.
117	00:07:51	00:07:55	That looks like a tire mark.
118	00:07:59	00:08:02	Maybe our gas explosion just turned into a hit-and-run.
119	00:08:29	00:08:33	Well, Robert said that he was going to be working late.
120	00:08:33	00:08:37	So I went to midnight bingo.
121	00:08:37	00:08:39	Alone?
122	00:08:39	00:08:41	Excuse me?
123	00:08:41	00:08:44	Alone?
124	00:08:44	00:08:47	I was... with a friend.
125	00:08:47	00:08:49	What was your friend's name?
126	00:08:49	00:08:51	Why?
127	00:08:51	00:08:53	Why not?
128	00:08:56	00:08:58	He's married.
129	00:08:58	00:09:03	Looks like the only person in this thing who isn't married is the dead girl in the trailer with your husband.
130	00:09:06	00:09:08	You didn't know he was having an affair?
131	00:09:08	00:09:11	No, I had no idea.
132	00:09:11	00:09:12	You have a '96 blue Ford Ranger.
133	00:09:13	00:09:14	We're going to need to take a look at it.
134	00:09:14	00:09:16	But my truck is in New Mexico.
135	00:09:16	00:09:19	My brother borrowed it this morning, he, uh...
136	00:09:19	00:09:21	you have no idea how to reach him.
137	00:09:21	00:09:25	Not until he gets back.
138	00:09:25	00:09:27	Why do you need to see my truck?
139	00:09:27	00:09:29	Let me tell you a story.
140	00:09:29	00:09:31	Once upon a time, you follow your husband to a trailer park.
141	00:09:31	00:09:33	You see him slumming with his little trailer bunny.
142	00:09:34	00:09:35	You waited for him to come out...
143	00:09:45	00:09:49	When she pulls the body back in, before she can call for help, you torch the place.
144	00:09:49	00:09:50	Kaboom.
145	00:09:52	00:09:54	The end.
146	00:09:54	00:09:57	That is the craziest thing I've ever heard.
147	00:09:58	00:10:01	Wouldn't even make my top ten.
148	00:10:03	00:10:08	So that's when the bereaved Mrs. Durgee lawyered up.
149	00:10:08	00:10:10	Broadcast's out on her truck, and the warrant's ready to go.
150	00:10:10	00:10:12	I don't care what he says.
151	00:10:12	00:10:14	Put him in the tank and see if he wises up.
152	00:10:14	00:10:16	Sure as hell can't get any dumber.
153	00:10:16	00:10:18	Detective Curtis.
154	00:10:18	00:10:20	Grissom.
155	00:10:20	00:10:23	I thought you were supposed to be arresting people in Boulder City.
156	00:10:23	00:10:26	Well, a spot opened up here and...
157	00:10:26	00:10:27	I transferred in today.
158	00:10:28	00:10:29	Surprise.
159	00:10:33	00:10:37	Well, your mother would be proud.
160	00:10:37	00:10:38	My mother made Captain.
161	00:10:38	00:10:46	You know, I'd just qualified for my shield when the sheriff pulled my papers and volunteered me to CSI.
162	00:10:46	00:10:49	I think my mom hated that more than I did.
163	00:10:49	00:10:51	You won't miss the lab, will you?
164	00:10:51	00:10:55	There's some things I'll miss.
165	00:10:55	00:10:57	I'll see you around.
166	00:11:53	00:11:55	So, Vartann and I struck out on G-String Row.
167	00:11:55	00:11:56	You poor guys.
168	00:11:56	00:11:58	Yeah, right.
169	00:11:58	00:11:59	You know what I mean.
170	00:11:59	00:12:02	No one recognized the victim's picture.
171	00:12:03	00:12:08	Listen, Cath, about this whole marriage thing...
172	00:12:09	00:12:10	Yeah, that.
173	00:12:10	00:12:12	Yeah, that kind of threw me for a loop.
174	00:12:14	00:12:15	Tina, right?
175	00:12:15	00:12:17	Yeah.
176	00:12:17	00:12:18	She must be a very special woman.
177	00:12:18	00:12:20	I look forward to meeting her.
178	00:12:20	00:12:21	Yes, she...
179	00:12:21	00:12:28	The vic's blood-alcohol level was .16 and COD was blunt-force trauma.
180	00:12:36	00:12:40	Smashed and then smashed, huh? Mm-hmm.
181	00:12:40	00:12:43	Any luck on the, uh...
182	00:12:43	00:12:44	victim's prints?
183	00:12:44	00:12:46	No work card, no record.
184	00:12:46	00:12:51	But the rubber boots were standard-issue Streets and Sanitation.
185	00:12:54	00:12:58	E.V.? Yeah, there's three S&amp;S workers with those initials.
186	00:12:58	00:13:03	And it looks like an Eddie Vonner was on duty last night.
187	00:13:03	00:13:05	Why would you want to see my boots?
188	00:13:05	00:13:07	You tell us.
189	00:13:07	00:13:12	Look, I know it's against the regs to pick up anything other than trash, but, I mean, come on.
190	00:13:12	00:13:18	She was barefoot; she was stepping on glass and crap, so, yeah, I gave her my boots.
191	00:13:18	00:13:22	And she practically begged, so, I gave her a lift.
192	00:13:22	00:13:23	So, you're just a good Samaritan.
193	00:13:23	00:13:26	Oh, come on, it was pretty obvious she didn't belong there.
194	00:13:26	00:13:29	Where? Jefferson and K? You ever see the citizens that hang out in that neighborhood?
195	00:13:29	00:13:31	When I see them, they're usually dead.
196	00:13:31	00:13:33	Well, there you go.
197	00:13:33	00:13:34	I mean, come on, she...
198	00:13:34	00:13:36	I could tell, despite the...
199	00:13:36	00:13:38	well, the get-up, she was hot.
200	00:13:38	00:13:40	And, I mean, I'm not talking like garbage truck hot.
201	00:13:40	00:13:42	I mean, she was like...
202	00:13:42	00:13:43	like limo hot.
203	00:13:43	00:13:47	Listen, did she tell you her name, or, uh, how she ended up there, anything?
204	00:13:47	00:13:50	She looked kind of embarrassed, so I didn't push it.
205	00:13:50	00:13:53	So, I just... I dropped her off down at, uh, Western and Industrial.
206	00:13:53	00:13:55	Never left my route.
207	00:13:55	00:13:57	Why, did she, uh...?
208	00:13:57	00:13:59	She say anything about me?
209	00:13:59	00:14:02	She died a few blocks from where you dropped her off.
210	00:14:14	00:14:22	If the wife torched the trailer and caused the explosion, you would expect to see small debris embedded all over the inside of these walls.
211	00:14:22	00:14:24	There's nothing here.
212	00:14:31	00:14:34	Hey, hey... Sara.
213	00:14:34	00:14:36	Check this out.
214	00:14:36	00:14:42	This is a piece of the exterior wall facing the road.
215	00:14:42	00:14:44	With a tire mark on it?
216	00:14:44	00:14:45	Yeah.
217	00:14:45	00:14:48	There is blue paint on this gas main.
218	00:14:48	00:14:51	Didn't mean anything at the time.
219	00:14:53	00:14:54	Amber has a blue Ford Ranger, right?
220	00:14:54	00:14:56	Uh-huh.
221	00:14:56	00:15:04	What if Amber follows her husband to trailer, sees him go inside, totally freaks out.
222	00:15:04	00:15:05	Why wait for him to come out?
223	00:15:12	00:15:15	Yeah. Yeah, just come straight through.
224	00:15:15	00:15:17	Run him over in bed with another chick.
225	00:15:17	00:15:22	Trailer collapses, fire breaks out, sweeps through, and destroys practically all evidence of a collision.
226	00:15:23	00:15:25	It's too bad we don't have her truck.
227	00:15:25	00:15:27	We could match this to her tires.
228	00:15:27	00:15:30	Well, '96 Ford Ranger, stock paint.
229	00:15:30	00:15:35	Maybe I can match the transfer to this.
230	00:15:37	00:15:38	I'm starving.
231	00:15:38	00:15:40	There's a uni going out for sandwiches.
232	00:15:40	00:15:41	Would you like me to get you something?
233	00:15:41	00:15:43	No, no, you go ahead. I'm gonna...
234	00:15:44	00:15:46	I'm gonna work on this.
235	00:16:38	00:16:40	According to the garbageman, she ran up from this direction.
236	00:16:40	00:16:41	Yeah?
237	00:16:41	00:16:43	Must be where she got the bag.
238	00:16:43	00:16:44	Hmm.
239	00:16:52	00:16:54	Victim wasn't carrying a cell phone.
240	00:16:54	00:16:58	She's in the wrong part of town in her underwear, scared out of her head.
241	00:16:58	00:17:01	She's gonna call her man, her family, someone.
242	00:17:01	00:17:06	And she didn't have a quarter, so she called 911.
243	00:17:06	00:17:07	I'll print the phones.
244	00:17:07	00:17:09	I'll dump the call records.
245	00:17:15	00:17:19	Let's get the traffic cameras, too.
246	00:17:21	00:17:27	The, uh, tread mark on your trailer wall is consistent with Michelin 195/70/R14s.
247	00:17:28	00:17:30	What about the blue paint scrapings we found on the gas main?
248	00:17:30	00:17:32	You got a real thing for blue paint.
249	00:17:32	00:17:33	You know that?
250	00:17:33	00:17:37	But, uh, this isn't from a Ford Ranger, or any Ford for that matter.
251	00:17:37	00:17:38	It's a GMC paint.
252	00:17:38	00:17:44	Amber Durgee was cheating on her husband, maybe even wanted him dead, but her truck didn't have anything to do with it.
253	00:17:44	00:17:46	Right tires, wrong vehicle.
254	00:17:46	00:17:47	Mm.
255	00:18:31	00:18:33	Found something?
256	00:18:33	00:18:34	Part of a headlamp, maybe.
257	00:18:34	00:18:38	Well, I found some blue paint transfer on that chain-link fence.
258	00:18:38	00:18:42	As far as tracks go, this place is a parking lot, man.
259	00:18:42	00:18:43	They're everywhere.
260	00:18:43	00:18:45	Except between the gas main and the trailer.
261	00:18:45	00:18:49	So, the trailer wasn'trammed?
262	00:18:50	00:18:55	I think we're looking at the, uh, vehicular equivalent of a through-and-through.
263	00:18:55	00:18:58	Car comes down the road.
264	00:18:58	00:19:01	Gas main acts acts as a ramp.
265	00:19:10	00:19:13	Flying car.
266	00:19:14	00:19:16	That's what we're gonna go with?
267	00:19:17	00:19:19	Okay.
268	00:19:21	00:19:26	The partial OEM number on the headlamp piece belongs to a '97 Pontiac Sunfire.
269	00:19:26	00:19:27	Boy, that was quick.
270	00:19:27	00:19:29	Well, GMC paint-- tire model wasn't that tough.
271	00:19:29	00:19:31	I'll put out another broadcast. All right.
272	00:19:38	00:19:40	Your broadcast was for a blue Pontiac.
273	00:19:40	00:19:42	Patrol figured this was worth a look.
274	00:19:42	00:19:46	How bad does a smell have to get before Parking Control calls Homicide?
275	00:19:46	00:19:49	No way this car was at the trailer park.
276	00:19:49	00:19:51	Think we've got a new case.
277	00:19:51	00:19:53	First citation was issued five days ago.
278	00:19:53	00:19:55	Car's probably been here at least six.
279	00:19:55	00:19:56	Six days in the summer heat.
280	00:20:00	00:20:02	And a trunk becomes a Crockpot.
281	00:20:02	00:20:04	Phew!
282	00:20:04	00:20:06	Looks like a male and a female.
283	00:20:10	00:20:12	That could be an entry wound in her skull.
284	00:20:12	00:20:16	Well, if she was shot in there, there might be bullets and casing.
285	00:20:16	00:20:18	I say we process the car in place.
286	00:20:18	00:20:20	Area is uncontrolled.
287	00:20:20	00:20:21	Evidence can be contaminated or lost.
288	00:20:22	00:20:23	We need to get this back to the lab.
289	00:20:23	00:20:25	Car condom.
290	00:20:53	00:20:56	Hi, CSI guy.
291	00:20:56	00:20:59	You're wondering why you're here?
292	00:20:59	00:21:01	Because you followed the evidence.
293	00:21:01	00:21:04	Archie? Archie?
294	00:21:04	00:21:05	Do you have anything on pay phone dump?
295	00:21:05	00:21:07	Oh. Yeah.
296	00:21:08	00:21:13	The 911 call about five minutes before your garbageman picked up the vic.
297	00:21:13	00:21:16	Then I matched timecodes with the video from the traffic cam.
298	00:21:17	00:21:19	Synched up the audio.
299	00:21:19	00:21:20	911. What is your emergency?
300	00:21:21	00:21:22	Whoa!
301	00:21:22	00:21:23	Ma'am, just calm down.
302	00:21:23	00:21:24	That's our girl.
303	00:21:24	00:21:25	Will you tell me your location?
304	00:21:25	00:21:26	No. I don't know where I am, okay?!
305	00:21:26	00:21:28	I don't know where I am. I'm just...
306	00:21:28	00:21:29	Yo, ho, get off my phone...
307	00:21:29	00:21:30	Someone's getting territorial.
308	00:21:30	00:21:32	I'll put Vartann on it.
309	00:21:35	00:21:37	Vic loses her shoes.
310	00:21:37	00:21:39	Explains the boots.
311	00:21:39	00:21:40	Let see where she came from.
312	00:21:40	00:21:42	Rewind it a little bit, would you?
313	00:21:42	00:21:43	Yeah.
314	00:21:45	00:21:46	Oh.
315	00:21:46	00:21:47	Stop. Hold it.
316	00:21:50	00:21:52	That looks like an airport shuttle.
317	00:21:55	00:21:57	There's a logo on this side.
318	00:21:57	00:21:58	Yeah.
319	00:21:58	00:21:59	I can enhance that.
320	00:22:02	00:22:03	That's a limo?
321	00:22:03	00:22:05	This is Vegas.
322	00:22:05	00:22:06	It's a strip bar on wheels.
323	00:22:13	00:22:14	I don't even pay attention to the talent.
324	00:22:15	00:22:18	I just drive down Industrial Boulevard, from strip club to strip club, picking 'em up.
325	00:22:18	00:22:20	It's like bus stops.
326	00:22:20	00:22:22	Before you know it, we're full, the bus is on fire...
327	00:22:30	00:22:32	We call it the Champagne Ride.
328	00:22:32	00:22:33	It's nice.
329	00:22:33	00:22:35	So what do the girls get paid for this?
330	00:22:35	00:22:37	The girls, they make uh...
331	00:22:37	00:22:40	at least twice as much as they do in the clubs.
332	00:22:40	00:22:42	Depending on what else they ride.
333	00:22:42	00:22:45	Oh...
334	00:23:00	00:23:02	It's a pretty sweet deal for the guys.
335	00:23:02	00:23:07	Hot chicks getting trashed with no security and nowhere to go.
336	00:23:07	00:23:10	And what happens when the girls want to get off?
337	00:23:10	00:23:12	Usually, it's the guys that are getting off.
338	00:23:14	00:23:16	I found something in there besides body fluids.
339	00:23:17	00:23:19	Belongs to the victim, Brooke Harris.
340	00:23:19	00:23:22	You dropped that girl off in a war zone, man.
341	00:23:22	00:23:24	When the guy paying the tab says he wants to stop, I just stop.
342	00:23:28	00:23:29	Come on...
343	00:23:29	00:23:30	Stop it!
344	00:23:30	00:23:32	Back off, jerk!
345	00:23:32	00:23:33	Stop the bus!
346	00:23:33	00:23:34	Get her off the bus!
347	00:23:34	00:23:36	No, I don't want...
348	00:23:36	00:23:38	Look, strippers are tough chicks, okay?
349	00:23:38	00:23:41	I figured she'd find a way home, one way or another.
350	00:23:47	00:23:49	Brooke Harris was getting calls from a gym?
351	00:23:49	00:23:51	Well, the Giselle number went straight to voice mail.
352	00:23:51	00:23:53	The voice mail said to contact her here.
353	00:23:53	00:23:55	And what's the word on the husband?
354	00:23:55	00:23:56	Huh?
355	00:23:56	00:23:57	The husband.
356	00:23:57	00:24:01	Yeah... no, according to his office, he's away in Laughlin on business.
357	00:24:01	00:24:03	We're still trying to get in touch...
358	00:24:03	00:24:07	Swing those legs up and around.
359	00:24:07	00:24:08	Yeah, like a waterfall... you got it.
360	00:24:08	00:24:11	That's it!
361	00:24:14	00:24:16	So I called Brooke a few times.
362	00:24:16	00:24:18	So what? She was one of my students.
363	00:24:18	00:24:20	You actually teach this?
364	00:24:20	00:24:22	Strippers have the best bodies in town.
365	00:24:22	00:24:24	If you want the body, this is how you get it.
366	00:24:24	00:24:28	Trust me, I've been doing this since before I had my driver's license.
367	00:24:28	00:24:29	Well, workout is one thing.
368	00:24:29	00:24:35	What is a housewife from Centennial Park doing on a stripper bus with pros?
369	00:24:35	00:24:36	She wanted it.
370	00:24:36	00:24:38	Come on...
371	00:24:38	00:24:40	No, really. She loved the attention.
372	00:24:40	00:24:41	Loved the fantasy.
373	00:24:41	00:24:42	She wanted to try it for real.
374	00:24:43	00:24:45	See how she stacked up against some real talent.
375	00:24:45	00:24:47	And you let her.
376	00:24:47	00:24:49	Do I look like her mother?
377	00:24:49	00:24:51	You were teaching her a lesson.
378	00:24:52	00:24:57	If I'd wanted to do that, I would've sent her to Stripperama, fed her to the wolves.
379	00:24:57	00:25:00	And drunk CEOs aren't wolves?
380	00:25:00	00:25:01	They're worse.
381	00:25:01	00:25:03	You know that.
382	00:25:03	00:25:04	That's why you kept calling her.
383	00:25:04	00:25:07	So you could hear all about it, right?
384	00:25:07	00:25:09	I was just calling to see how things went.
385	00:25:09	00:25:10	Oh, really?
386	00:25:10	00:25:12	It's starting to sound like I need a lawyer.
387	00:25:16	00:25:24	So I pulled all the ROs from all the '97 blue Sunfires in Nevada, one name and address just jumped out...
388	00:25:24	00:25:26	Randy Swansiger.
389	00:25:26	00:25:28	Las Vegas Police!
390	00:25:28	00:25:30	Come on out, Randy.
391	00:25:35	00:25:37	Michelin tires.
392	00:25:37	00:25:38	Blue car.
393	00:25:38	00:25:40	Broken headlamp.
394	00:25:40	00:25:42	Hey, how's it goin'?
395	00:25:43	00:25:44	I'm Detective Jim Brass. Remember me?
396	00:25:44	00:25:46	Hey, hey, hey, hey...
397	00:25:46	00:25:48	Whoa, whoa...
398	00:25:48	00:25:49	What are you guys doing?
399	00:25:49	00:25:52	You got a couple of DWIs on your record.
400	00:25:52	00:25:54	What have you got to say for yourself, Randy?
401	00:25:55	00:26:01	I was coming home... been working late...
402	00:26:02	00:26:05	I guess I fell asleep at the wheel...
403	00:26:10	00:26:12	Next thing I know...
404	00:26:14	00:26:16	crash-boom-bang!
405	00:26:19	00:26:22	The car still worked, so...
406	00:26:44	00:26:47	Drain plug's probably under the carpet.
407	00:26:47	00:26:48	I think I found it.
408	00:26:52	00:26:55	Ahh...
409	00:26:55	00:26:58	Technically, that makes you a cannibal.
410	00:26:59	00:27:01	Grissom would be proud.
411	00:27:03	00:27:06	Grissom would've tasted it on purpose.
412	00:27:10	00:27:11	It's working.
413	00:27:58	00:28:00	That makes 34 prints.
414	00:28:00	00:28:01	Jacqui's going to love me.
415	00:28:03	00:28:04	You got something?
416	00:28:05	00:28:06	I think so...
417	00:28:08	00:28:10	Bullet fragment.
418	00:28:10	00:28:11	Copper-jacketed.
419	00:28:12	00:28:13	Rules out a .22.
420	00:28:13	00:28:15	See, it was worth it.
421	00:28:17	00:28:21	You better get ready for this because this is going to blow you away.
422	00:28:21	00:28:24	The rust-colored material you found on the victim's head wound...
423	00:28:24	00:28:25	was rust.
424	00:28:25	00:28:30	Plain old ferric oxide, found on nearly every iron object on the planet Earth.
425	00:28:30	00:28:31	Case breaker?
426	00:28:31	00:28:33	No?
427	00:28:33	00:28:35	As they say, garbage in, garbage out.
428	00:28:37	00:28:45	Um... the Champagne Ride picks up strippers near the clubs, but not actually at the clubs.
429	00:28:45	00:28:51	Right. The owners don't like that bus coming anywhere near the clubs because they don't make any money off them.
430	00:28:51	00:28:54	Well, look, Brooke Harris wasn't planning to die that night.
431	00:28:54	00:28:56	She had to have parked her car somewhere.
432	00:28:56	00:29:03	Well, there's a secured parking lot not too far from where the garbageman dropped her off.
433	00:29:03	00:29:07	So, if she parked her car here...
434	00:29:07	00:29:10	why did she go here?
435	00:29:12	00:29:13	Hey, Catherine...
436	00:29:14	00:29:15	Yes?
437	00:29:15	00:29:17	Can we talk?
438	00:29:17	00:29:19	About this?
439	00:29:24	00:29:25	Sure.
440	00:29:25	00:29:28	You know, what happened to Nick...
441	00:29:28	00:29:30	it just got me thinking.
442	00:29:32	00:29:35	Life is so short, you know?
443	00:29:35	00:29:41	It's almost... it's almost shorter than we want to ever believe.
444	00:29:43	00:29:44	Live for the day.
445	00:29:44	00:29:46	Exactly.
446	00:29:46	00:29:56	So, I, uh... I've been heading to ask this young lady I've been seeing, Tina, to marry me.
447	00:29:58	00:30:00	You know that I'm happy for you.
448	00:30:00	00:30:01	Yeah?
449	00:30:03	00:30:04	Yeah.
450	00:30:04	00:30:09	But it also feels like you're not so happy for me.
451	00:30:14	00:30:16	Warrick...
452	00:30:23	00:30:28	You know, the thing that makes a fantasy great is the possibility that it might come true.
453	00:30:28	00:30:33	And when you lose that possibility...
454	00:30:36	00:30:38	it just kind of sucks.
455	00:30:43	00:30:51	Okay, Mr. Greg, your most likely match is a .44 round recovered from a drug-related shoot-out in Mesquite five days ago.
456	00:30:51	00:30:52	Case is still open.
457	00:30:52	00:30:56	That's roughly two days after the bodies ended up in the trunk.
458	00:30:56	00:30:59	Maybe our vics were the beginning of a little crime spree.
459	00:30:59	00:31:00	Thanks.
460	00:31:00	00:31:01	I ran the Grand Am's VIN.
461	00:31:01	00:31:04	Last RO was a tow yard over by Nellis.
462	00:31:04	00:31:09	Vehicle's most likely an impound, sold under the table to some scammer who faked his tags.
463	00:31:09	00:31:10	You're not going to get far in that direction.
464	00:31:10	00:31:12	I know. What about prints?
465	00:31:12	00:31:13	13 different IDs.
466	00:31:13	00:31:18	Some off work cards, some off felonies ranging from assault, B&amp;E, cocaine trafficking.
467	00:31:18	00:31:24	Well, even if I do manage to track them all down, there's no guarantee any of these were involved with the vics.
468	00:31:24	00:31:29	Well, they didn't put themselves in the trunk, and unless they were shot right there at the curb, somebody drove the car there.
469	00:31:29	00:31:32	You're the detective. Go detect.
470	00:31:32	00:31:36	Fully developed skeletal structure consistent with an adult male.
471	00:31:36	00:31:40	The medial end of the clavicle's almost fused.
472	00:31:40	00:31:41	Suggests he's about 25 years old.
473	00:31:41	00:31:45	Lack of prognathism indicates he's Caucasian.
474	00:31:45	00:31:50	The female, however, is prognathic...
475	00:31:51	00:31:53	and that suggests Negroid.
476	00:31:53	00:31:57	Unfused epiphysial ends make her a teenager.
477	00:31:58	00:32:00	White male, younger black female...
478	00:32:01	00:32:02	racially motivated?
479	00:32:02	00:32:04	Could be a Son of Sam thing.
480	00:32:04	00:32:08	Summertime, couple on a date, making out in the car.
481	00:32:08	00:32:10	Berkowitz used a .44.
482	00:32:10	00:32:13	Gunshot wounds are most likely COD for both.
483	00:32:14	00:32:17	Female shows an entry wound at the rear of the skull.
484	00:32:17	00:32:18	Exit wound took off most of her face.
485	00:32:19	00:32:23	Male has no exit wound, but the entry wound...
486	00:32:23	00:32:24	is pretty obvious.
487	00:32:26	00:32:28	Bullet never left the skull.
488	00:32:28	00:32:30	That would explain the bullet fragments.
489	00:32:30	00:32:32	What we need are IDs.
490	00:32:32	00:32:40	No missing persons filed for Caucasian males between 20 and 30 in the last two weeks, but there are possibles for the girl.
491	00:32:40	00:32:42	Hm.
492	00:32:42	00:32:45	Two cases still open.
493	00:32:45	00:32:47	13 seems a little young.
494	00:32:47	00:32:48	Could be a kidnapping.
495	00:32:51	00:32:52	The other one's 16.
496	00:32:52	00:32:55	This is one time it would be better to stay missing.
497	00:33:02	00:33:06	I also brought her toothbrush and her hairbrush.
498	00:33:07	00:33:09	This one's from her doctor.
499	00:33:10	00:33:11	Other's from her dentist.
500	00:33:15	00:33:18	How long is it going to take you?
501	00:33:18	00:33:20	That's hard to say.
502	00:33:20	00:33:24	Mr. James, was Clara by any chance seeing an older man?
503	00:33:24	00:33:30	As far as I know, she wasn't seeing anybody but it wouldn't surprise me if she was.
504	00:33:30	00:33:36	Clara wasn't smart when it come to people, talking to any lowlife chump who'd give her the time of day.
505	00:33:36	00:33:40	The girl never did listen to a damn word I said.
506	00:33:40	00:33:41	The older man...
507	00:33:41	00:33:44	um... could've been someone she met at school?
508	00:33:46	00:33:48	Did she have a part-time job?
509	00:33:48	00:33:51	Gooeybunz, over on El Dorado.
510	00:33:52	00:33:56	We found a number of half-eaten Gooeybunz in the car.
511	00:33:56	00:34:01	You know, Clara wasn't really that smart about her diet either, but she hated those things.
512	00:34:02	00:34:04	Smell'd get into her clothes.
513	00:34:04	00:34:07	By the time she got home, she practically ready to throw up.
514	00:34:09	00:34:12	You find out who did this...
515	00:34:12	00:34:14	you let me know.
516	00:34:14	00:34:15	Yeah.
517	00:34:18	00:34:21	According to Clara James' father, Clara didn't eat Gooeybunz.
518	00:34:21	00:34:27	She didn't like them, which means it was either the killer or the male DB.
519	00:34:27	00:34:29	So we're looking for...
520	00:34:29	00:34:30	bite marks?
521	00:34:30	00:34:34	If we find a good impression, maybe we'll get an ID through dental records.
522	00:34:34	00:34:36	You got it.
523	00:34:36	00:34:38	And the student becomes a master.
524	00:34:50	00:34:52	I'm not seeing any bite marks.
525	00:34:53	00:34:55	Me either.
526	00:34:55	00:34:57	It's not like they were bitten at all.
527	00:34:57	00:34:59	More like torn apart.
528	00:35:01	00:35:03	Check it out.
529	00:35:03	00:35:06	They might all be in pieces...
530	00:35:06	00:35:08	but they're all still here.
531	00:35:08	00:35:11	No one ever ate any of them.
532	00:35:11	00:35:12	Which is kinda weird.
533	00:35:12	00:35:15	I mean, why buy all of 'em and not eat 'em?
534	00:35:19	00:35:25	I found this one under a passenger seat-- intact, on the floor.
535	00:35:25	00:35:27	It escaped the carnage.
536	00:35:48	00:35:50	That's not frosting.
537	00:35:51	00:35:54	I always liked the middle part the best.
538	00:35:54	00:35:57	When she parks her car, she's a hot housewife.
539	00:35:57	00:36:01	A few hours later, she's just another freak.
540	00:36:07	00:36:08	It's my Mercedes, okay?
541	00:36:08	00:36:10	I can prove it. Just give me the keys.
542	00:36:10	00:36:12	Show me ten bucks or you ain't proving squat.
543	00:36:12	00:36:13	I don't have anywhere to go!
544	00:36:13	00:36:16	Brooke Harris probably spent ten bucks a day on nonfat lattes.
545	00:36:16	00:36:19	Right. She needed money to get her car back.
546	00:36:19	00:36:22	Well, I don't see any ATMs around here.
547	00:36:22	00:36:24	This is a bad place to be broke.
548	00:36:24	00:36:25	Hey, you miss me?
549	00:36:38	00:36:40	Rusty flakes.
550	00:36:40	00:36:43	Hey, Michaels, did you put this crime tape up?
551	00:36:43	00:36:45	Yes, sir.
552	00:36:49	00:36:51	Yeah, well, you missed something.
553	00:36:51	00:36:53	There's blood on this rebar.
554	00:36:55	00:36:56	Where'd you find that?
555	00:36:56	00:37:00	I, uh... I just picked it up over there...
556	00:37:17	00:37:19	May I ask you a question?
557	00:37:21	00:37:24	Do you recognize this woman?
558	00:37:24	00:37:26	She's a thief.
559	00:37:26	00:37:29	She took some money out of my hat.
560	00:37:35	00:37:37	Hey! Hey!
561	00:37:45	00:37:47	Stealing's a crime.
562	00:37:50	00:37:52	Hey, Michaels.
563	00:37:52	00:37:55	Think you might be able to take this man into custody?
564	00:38:03	00:38:14	Tox confirmed that the packet in the Gooeybun contained cocaine, and one of the prints that I lifted off the Grand Am was a felony conviction for cocaine trafficking-- Joey Zack, drug dealer.
565	00:38:14	00:38:16	seems he liked to use Gooeybunz to move his coke.
566	00:38:20	00:38:23	He's a nice regular customer at Gooeybunz.
567	00:38:23	00:38:29	He used to chat up cute Clara when he was there, sweet-talks her into a date, and they both end up dead in his bitchin' Grand Am.
568	00:38:29	00:38:33	Well, whoever did it must've done it for the drugs.
569	00:38:33	00:38:35	GCMS on the melted gloves from your Grand Am.
570	00:38:35	00:38:44	A delicious confection of sugar, gelatin, starches, citric acid, mineral oil, Red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 1 and carnauba wax, Candy.
571	00:38:44	00:38:46	Gummy candy.
572	00:38:47	00:38:49	I'm partial to Jujubes myself.
573	00:38:49	00:38:50	Is it something I said?
574	00:38:50	00:38:52	Probably.
575	00:38:52	00:38:57	Joey Zack's print was found on the radio, which was tuned to 107 FM.
576	00:38:57	00:39:09	Now, as far as I know, there is only one place in town where you can get gummies, a generic cheeseburger, and 107.1 gets anything other than static.
577	00:39:11	00:39:13	Sorry, I don't recognize him.
578	00:39:13	00:39:15	Most of the time when people come here, it's dark.
579	00:39:15	00:39:17	How about this? You ever seen this car before?
580	00:39:17	00:39:23	No, all I remember from the last two weeks is what's playing 'cause I've seen it 8,000 times.
581	00:39:23	00:39:26	Killer Punch. A big draw for crap cars.
582	00:39:26	00:39:28	We're gonna need to talk to your employees.
583	00:39:28	00:39:29	Oh, come on, please.
584	00:39:29	00:39:31	Is that really necessary?
585	00:39:31	00:39:33	It's a homicide investigation.
586	00:39:33	00:39:36	We could just call the health inspector and...
587	00:39:36	00:39:39	see how many code violations he has festering in that concession stand.
588	00:39:39	00:39:41	Geez, fine, knock yourselves out.
589	00:39:41	00:39:43	Jerry's on tickets...
590	00:39:43	00:39:46	Maddox runs the projector, and Darryl's in concessions.
591	00:39:46	00:39:48	No. No, he quit last week.
592	00:39:48	00:39:49	Why?
593	00:39:49	00:39:52	He said he was gonna go live with his parents up in Mesquite.
594	00:39:54	00:39:56	Guy's name is Darryl Blakeny.
595	00:39:56	00:39:59	Small-time hood with priors for B&amp;E and possession.
596	00:39:59	00:40:02	His prints were on the steering wheel of the Grand Am.
597	00:40:02	00:40:06	When he quit his job at the drive-in, he was in court-ordered rehab.
598	00:40:06	00:40:09	We figured Blakeny was one of Joey Zack's customers.
599	00:40:09	00:40:15	One night, Blakeny sees his coke dealer's Grand Am at the drive-in, and the fiend snaps.
600	00:40:19	00:40:21	Move, and you're dead!
601	00:40:21	00:40:22	Shut up! All right, all right, all right!
602	00:40:22	00:40:23	Give me the coke, Joey!
603	00:40:24	00:40:25	Give me the coke!
604	00:40:26	00:40:29	Do we know where he killed them?
605	00:40:29	00:40:30	We don't know where yet.
606	00:40:30	00:40:31	Or why.
607	00:40:32	00:40:35	Maybe the girl started freaking out; maybe Blakeny's just a psycho.
608	00:40:35	00:40:41	Anyway, uh, Blakeny tossed the bodies, and throws them in the trunk and drives home.
609	00:40:41	00:40:46	The street where the Grand Am was found is a block away from his last known residence.
610	00:40:46	00:40:53	He leaves it there collecting parking tickets, skips town, and uses the same gun two days later in another drug-related crime in Mesquite.
611	00:40:53	00:40:56	The scumbag's still in the wind.
612	00:40:56	00:40:59	At least he's in the system with a double homicide.
613	00:40:59	00:41:02	That's not going to satisfy Clara James' father.
614	00:41:05	00:41:07	Can she cook? Is she a good cook?
615	00:41:07	00:41:08	Come on, Warrick.
616	00:41:08	00:41:09	Hey, Grissom.
617	00:41:09	00:41:15	We're taking Warrick to the Pepper Mill to celebrate his marriage and to condemn his elopement.
618	00:41:15	00:41:16	You in?
619	00:41:16	00:41:18	Did you invite your wife?
620	00:41:18	00:41:21	I don't think I'm ready to subject her to the crew just yet.
621	00:41:21	00:41:23	I got to beg off, you guys.
622	00:41:23	00:41:24	Got to take Lindsay to school.
623	00:41:24	00:41:26	All right. Bye.
624	00:41:26	00:41:27	Bye.
625	00:41:27	00:41:28	So?
626	00:41:29	00:41:31	I got one more thing to do. All right.
627	00:41:32	00:41:35	Don't.
628	00:41:35	00:41:37	So, breathe quick.
629	00:41:37	00:41:39	Breathe slow.
630	00:41:39	00:41:43	Put your gun in your mouth and pull the trigger.
631	00:41:43	00:41:48	Any way you like, you're going to die here.
632	00:41:48	00:41:49	Okay?
633	00:41:49	00:41:51	Perfect.
634	00:41:53	00:41:54	Okay?
635	00:41:55	00:41:56	Perfect.
636	00:41:57	00:41:59	How'd you know it was going to be there?
637	00:41:59	00:42:03	If that okay had been meant for Nick, it wouldn't have been in the form of a question.
638	00:42:03	00:42:08	I think maybe Walter Gordon had an accomplice.
639	00:42:09	00:42:12	Perfect.
640	00:42:12	00:42:13	Male or female?
641	00:42:13	00:42:15	It's, um...
642	00:42:15	00:42:17	hard to say.
643	00:42:17	00:42:19	The tape was pretty mangled.
644	00:42:19	00:42:24	Enhancement and noise cancellation increase intelligibility, but it alters timber and tone.
645	00:42:24	00:42:28	I don't know there's any more I can do here.
646	00:42:28	00:42:31	You know, Nick recorded a message on the flip side of the tape.
647	00:42:31	00:42:32	You think maybe we should...
648	00:42:32	00:42:34	No.
649	00:42:35	00:42:37	This is between you and me.
