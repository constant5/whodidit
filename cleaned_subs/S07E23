0,00:00:02,00:00:05,(spurs jingling)
1,00:00:10,00:00:13,(thunder rumbling)
2,00:00:23,00:00:25,(jangling spurs approaching)
3,00:00:26,00:00:29,(thunder crashing)
4,00:00:35,00:00:36,You're late.
5,00:00:46,00:00:47,Now say it.
6,00:00:47,00:00:50,(tinny piano playing off-key)
7,00:00:51,00:00:55,I said... say it.
8,00:00:55,00:00:57,You have to say it.
9,00:00:57,00:00:59,Say it.
10,00:00:59,00:01:01,(gagging)
11,00:01:04,00:01:06,Is she going to be okay?
12,00:01:06,00:01:08,"Yes, ma'am, she's stable."
13,00:01:08,00:01:09,Severe trauma to the neck.
14,00:01:09,00:01:11,"Heather, I'm Catherine Willows."
15,00:01:11,00:01:12,I don't know if you remember me.
16,00:01:14,00:01:15,It's going to be all right.
17,00:01:21,00:01:23,"Like a bad penny, some people just keep showing up."
18,00:01:23,00:01:25,Did you call Grissom?
19,00:01:29,00:01:30,Who found her?
20,00:01:30,00:01:32,Guy over there in the ten gallon-- Vernon Porter.
21,00:01:32,00:01:34,He's a night watchman.
22,00:01:34,00:01:37,All the employees are required to wear that cowboy getup.
23,00:01:37,00:01:41,That's the job that cops get after they retire.
24,00:01:41,00:01:43,"You've got something to look forward to, Jim."
25,00:01:43,00:01:47,"(piano playing jaunty tune) Yes, ma'am."
26,00:01:47,00:01:50,WILLOWS: Chewing tobacco. Looks fresh.
27,00:01:54,00:01:56,(piano playing)
28,00:02:03,00:02:06,Lady Heather has a house for this.
29,00:02:06,00:02:09,Why take her show on the road?
30,00:02:09,00:02:12,Do you think you know how to...? Yeah.
31,00:02:15,00:02:16,(piano stops)
32,00:02:16,00:02:19,"Oh, you're a genius."
33,00:02:19,00:02:21,"Well, this is where we found her."
34,00:02:21,00:02:22,WILLOWS: Did she have ligature marks?
35,00:02:22,00:02:24,"On her neck, yeah."
36,00:02:24,00:02:26,"Well, that doesn't make any sense."
37,00:02:26,00:02:27,She was a dominatrix.
38,00:02:27,00:02:30,Not a submissive.
39,00:02:30,00:02:32,Maybe the party just got out of control.
40,00:02:32,00:02:36,Or somebody didn't know the rules.
41,00:03:08,00:03:10,How you doing?
42,00:03:10,00:03:12,These files are out of control.
43,00:03:13,00:03:18,"Typos, white-outs, names missing, whole sections missing. 20 years ago, the county was still using typewriters."
44,00:03:18,00:03:19,Did you find anything?
45,00:03:19,00:03:21,Ernie Dell's foster child.
46,00:03:21,00:03:22,Donna Catalani.
47,00:03:22,00:03:25,Lived with the Dells for a year.
48,00:03:25,00:03:27,Her CASA report came with a supplemental.
49,00:03:27,00:03:28,They forgot to black out her social security number.
50,00:03:28,00:03:32,"We can use that to track her down, unless the adoptives changed it."
51,00:03:33,00:03:34,Good. I'll run it.
52,00:03:34,00:03:35,I have to pull you off of this.
53,00:03:35,00:03:37,Days is down to four CSIs.
54,00:03:37,00:03:38,You're on loan-out.
55,00:03:38,00:03:40,Why can't Days keep anybody?
56,00:03:40,00:03:42,"Money, stress, Ecklie, maybe."
57,00:03:43,00:03:45,Just help them with their backlog.
58,00:03:48,00:03:50,So you're sure that the gate was locked?
59,00:03:50,00:03:52,I come on at 6:00 when Oakley's closes.
60,00:03:52,00:03:55,The first thing I do is lock the gate.
61,00:03:55,00:03:58,Make my rounds every two hours.
62,00:03:58,00:04:03,"8:00, 10:00, 12:00-- everything was Code 4."
63,00:04:03,00:04:04,When did things go Code 3?
64,00:04:05,00:04:08,Found the main gate unlocked at 0214.
65,00:04:08,00:04:10,"Went to check out the street, heard that music."
66,00:04:10,00:04:14,"Found her on the floor, called it in."
67,00:04:14,00:04:17,SIDLE: This is a family theme park.
68,00:04:17,00:04:20,I'm assuming they don't actually serve alcohol here.
69,00:04:20,00:04:23,Must have brought their own.
70,00:04:23,00:04:26,"Single malt, 30 years old."
71,00:04:26,00:04:27,S &amp; M is a rich man's sport.
72,00:04:27,00:04:30,Kind of like hockey-- a lot of equipment.
73,00:04:30,00:04:32,How much do you think a night like this would cost?
74,00:04:32,00:04:37,"Heather told me, five years ago, she was clearing 20 grand a week."
75,00:04:37,00:04:40,And that was before ladyheather.com.
76,00:04:42,00:04:44,What is she like?
77,00:04:44,00:04:47,Beautiful...
78,00:04:47,00:04:49,"smart, intense..."
79,00:04:49,00:04:52,charming.
80,00:04:52,00:04:54,The only woman I've ever seen rattle Grissom.
81,00:04:54,00:05:00,"I mean, he kind of liked that forensic anthropologist, Terry Miller."
82,00:05:00,00:05:01,Remember her?
83,00:05:01,00:05:03,Yeah.
84,00:05:03,00:05:07,But she wasn't enough of a challenge for him.
85,00:05:07,00:05:10,"Heather, on the other hand..."
86,00:05:10,00:05:15,uninhibited and can beat him at mental chess.
87,00:05:17,00:05:19,They had chemistry.
88,00:05:19,00:05:21,And he is a scientist.
89,00:05:21,00:05:27,"I have no proof and I know he'd never tell me, but I'm certain they spent the night together."
90,00:05:27,00:05:30,Wonder which one wore the chaps.
91,00:05:30,00:05:32,Lots of... (clears throat) ...coins and toothpicks.
92,00:05:32,00:05:34,They don't sweep under here.
93,00:05:34,00:05:41,"I mean, more power to him, really, to find somebody outside of work 'cause you start fishing from the company pier, and..."
94,00:05:41,00:05:43,asking for trouble.
95,00:05:43,00:05:46,I got a shot glass.
96,00:05:46,00:05:49,Looks like there's some lipstick around the rim.
97,00:05:49,00:05:52,"My fantasy does not include costumes, or pain..."
98,00:05:52,00:05:55,and certainly not sawdust.
99,00:05:57,00:05:59,You?
100,00:06:01,00:06:03,CURTIS: Patrol found her.
101,00:06:03,00:06:05,Any witnesses?
102,00:06:05,00:06:09,"No. No businesses open, no cars on the side streets."
103,00:06:09,00:06:11,So how'd she get here?
104,00:06:11,00:06:15,"CURTIS: Well, in this neighborhood, unless she's a hooker, I doubt she walked."
105,00:06:15,00:06:20,"I'm going to go make some calls, see if any of these places have any security cameras."
106,00:06:20,00:06:22,Thanks.
107,00:06:22,00:06:25,That's a pretty nasty head wound.
108,00:06:25,00:06:26,Where's Super Dave?
109,00:06:27,00:06:29,He's probably at the 420 on Flamingo.
110,00:06:29,00:06:31,They left their purse.
111,00:06:32,00:06:34,Oh!
112,00:06:34,00:06:35,The thing is heavier than my kid.
113,00:06:35,00:06:37,Ever get hit in the head with one of these?
114,00:06:38,00:06:41,No. Gentlemen don't get hit in the head with those.
115,00:06:41,00:06:42,BROWN: Gentlemen...
116,00:06:46,00:06:48,Keysha Sayrun?
117,00:06:49,00:06:50,"Well, that's not her."
118,00:06:50,00:06:52,Maybe it's not her purse.
119,00:06:52,00:06:54,BROWN: There's a whole bunch of wallets in here.
120,00:06:54,00:06:57,Driver's permit.
121,00:06:57,00:07:00,Kid's only 15-- has got a credit card?
122,00:07:00,00:07:02,She's got to be a pickpocket.
123,00:07:02,00:07:04,"Aw, man, that's a shame."
124,00:07:04,00:07:05,Look at her.
125,00:07:05,00:07:07,She could be anything she wanted to be.
126,00:07:07,00:07:09,Makes you wonder what happens to people.
127,00:07:09,00:07:11,I got her.
128,00:07:11,00:07:12,Faith Maroney.
129,00:07:13,00:07:15,Twenty-five...
130,00:07:15,00:07:17,from Southern Highlands.
131,00:07:17,00:07:22,"Sometimes I miss the days when I didn't take this job so personally, Warrick."
132,00:07:22,00:07:26,"Yeah? Well, I miss the days when we only had five homicides a week."
133,00:07:37,00:07:42,(phone ringing)
134,00:07:42,00:07:43,Grissom.
135,00:07:44,00:07:46,Catherine.
136,00:07:46,00:07:48,I'm on my way.
137,00:07:51,00:07:54,I was planning an Old West party.
138,00:07:54,00:07:57,I was checking out the facilities.
139,00:07:57,00:07:59,So why couldn't you check them out during normal business hours?
140,00:07:59,00:08:00,It was my normal business hours.
141,00:08:00,00:08:02,"You know, we spoke to the night watchman."
142,00:08:02,00:08:05,He said the gate was locked. How did you get in?
143,00:08:05,00:08:06,I know the owner.
144,00:08:06,00:08:08,Do you know him the way you know Judge Fincher?
145,00:08:08,00:08:10,Because I know that's how you got out of jail last time.
146,00:08:11,00:08:12,I need a name.
147,00:08:12,00:08:13,Mr. Oakley.
148,00:08:13,00:08:15,"I have his number, but not on me."
149,00:08:15,00:08:17,You'll have to look it up. (knocking)
150,00:08:17,00:08:19,Hi.
151,00:08:19,00:08:20,I'm with the crime lab.
152,00:08:20,00:08:21,Sara Sidle.
153,00:08:22,00:08:26,I'm here to collect your clothes and trace evidence from your body.
154,00:08:26,00:08:28,Can I say no?
155,00:08:28,00:08:30,Why would you want to?
156,00:08:30,00:08:33,Did the nurse forget to collect an SAE kit?
157,00:08:33,00:08:35,Not necessary.
158,00:08:35,00:08:37,"You don't want help, that's okay by me."
159,00:08:37,00:08:39,Just don't waste my time.
160,00:08:39,00:08:41,I've got a lot of cases on my desk that need my attention.
161,00:08:42,00:08:45,"So when you come out of your haze, give me a call."
162,00:08:47,00:08:49,(door closing)
163,00:08:52,00:08:57,I don't respond well to men who judge me based solely on my profession.
164,00:08:57,00:08:59,"I get that a lot, too."
165,00:08:59,00:09:00,Law enforcement.
166,00:09:05,00:09:07,May I move your hair?
167,00:09:22,00:09:24,These look like rope marks on your neck.
168,00:09:26,00:09:28,Grissom.
169,00:09:33,00:09:35,I'll be done in a minute.
170,00:09:39,00:09:41,(yawns)
171,00:09:41,00:09:43,"What's the matter, Doc, you been hitting it a little too hard?"
172,00:09:43,00:09:45,"No, canine-induced insomnia."
173,00:09:46,00:09:48,We're fostering some puppies-- Jack Russells.
174,00:09:48,00:09:49,Had me up all night.
175,00:09:50,00:09:51,How about a puppy to keep you company?
176,00:09:51,00:09:54,"No, if I stay up all night, it's not going to be because of a puppy."
177,00:09:54,00:09:56,C.O.D.?
178,00:09:56,00:10:01,"Okay, blunt force trauma to the left temporal region of the skull."
179,00:10:01,00:10:03,The skull's fractured.
180,00:10:03,00:10:05,Any idea what kind of weapon might have been used?
181,00:10:05,00:10:08,"No, but I found these imbedded in the skull."
182,00:10:12,00:10:13,Paint chips?
183,00:10:13,00:10:16,"Could she have been hit by a car? Well, it's possible."
184,00:10:16,00:10:21,"But if she was standing when she was hit, I'd expect to find pedestrian fractures on her legs."
185,00:10:21,00:10:24,"And there are no run-over marks, so she wasn't in a prone position."
186,00:10:24,00:10:27,So if she wasn't standing or lying down...
187,00:10:27,00:10:30,She was somewhere in-between.
188,00:10:31,00:10:33,"Stokes, you ready for a cup of coffee?"
189,00:10:33,00:10:38,"No, thanks. I'm only going to be about another ten minutes here, okay?"
190,00:10:38,00:10:39,Your call.
191,00:10:51,00:10:54,Hey.
192,00:10:54,00:10:56,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
193,00:10:56,00:10:58,"You all right, man?"
194,00:10:58,00:11:00,You all right?
195,00:11:08,00:11:12,Are you here in a professional capacity?
196,00:11:12,00:11:15,Does it make a difference?
197,00:11:15,00:11:17,Maybe not to you.
198,00:11:17,00:11:19,I feel exposed.
199,00:11:19,00:11:21,The last time you saw me...
200,00:11:21,00:11:23,You had just lost your daughter.
201,00:11:23,00:11:26,That's not all I lost that night.
202,00:11:29,00:11:31,Heather!
203,00:11:31,00:11:39,"If a client did this, and left you to die, why are you protecting him?"
204,00:11:39,00:11:40,I'm not.
205,00:11:40,00:11:42,Tell me the truth.
206,00:11:46,00:11:48,Did they check your glucose level when you came in?
207,00:11:48,00:11:52,Heather?
208,00:11:53,00:11:56,She's diabetic. I think she's going into shock.
209,00:11:56,00:11:58,The patient never told us.
210,00:12:01,00:12:06,"Captain, I'll need a copy of the police report for my insurance."
211,00:12:06,00:12:08,"Oh, sure, sure, sure. We'll get to that."
212,00:12:08,00:12:17,"But, first, I need to straighten out a few things. Mr. Oakley, did you give Heather Kessler permission to enter the park after hours?"
213,00:12:17,00:12:19,"No, I didn't. I did."
214,00:12:19,00:12:22,She called the office. Wanted to know about renting out Oakley's Saloon for a private party.
215,00:12:22,00:12:24,"Well, you know what she does for a living, right?"
216,00:12:25,00:12:27,"Money's money-- doesn't matter who's handing it to you, right, Dad?"
217,00:12:27,00:12:29,As long as you're not breaking the law.
218,00:12:29,00:12:33,So you have no problem with a dominatrix doing business at a family theme park?
219,00:12:33,00:12:37,"Captain, sometimes, my son, he... he doesn't think things all the way through."
220,00:12:37,00:12:39,But I'm learning.
221,00:12:39,00:12:41,So how did she get in?
222,00:12:41,00:12:43,I swung by. Wanted to meet her.
223,00:12:43,00:12:45,After midnight? Yeah.
224,00:12:45,00:12:47,Told her to lock up when she was done.
225,00:12:47,00:12:48,"You should have stayed, Ben."
226,00:12:48,00:12:49,You got liability to think about.
227,00:12:50,00:12:52,"Right, Dad. 'Cause you always do."
228,00:12:55,00:12:58,"Captain, is this about it?"
229,00:12:58,00:13:00,"Well, I'd like to talk to Benny a little more."
230,00:13:00,00:13:02,We need to confirm his statement.
231,00:13:27,00:13:29,(camera clicking)
232,00:13:56,00:13:58,(camera clicking)
233,00:13:59,00:14:06,"There were no security cameras at the crime scene, but Ms. Maroney had multiple arrests for petty theft and shoplifting."
234,00:14:06,00:14:11,She had just been released on court-ordered rehab for kleptomania.
235,00:14:11,00:14:16,"She got noodles, hairpins, dish towels, a can of tuna."
236,00:14:16,00:14:18,She didn't care what she took.
237,00:14:18,00:14:19,She just had to take it.
238,00:14:20,00:14:21,"You know, I was thinking."
239,00:14:21,00:14:25,"If she pinched my wallet, and I whacked her for it, I'd probably get back my wallet before I split."
240,00:14:25,00:14:28,Which means the theft victims are probably not the suspects.
241,00:14:29,00:14:30,Got anything else?
242,00:14:30,00:14:41,"A couple of loose receipts, all from last night, all paid in cash. A pack of gum from the Bargain Bin, a soda from Carlisa's, and a Bloody Mary from Diane's Steakhouse."
243,00:14:41,00:14:44,Which is less than quarter of a mile from the crime scene.
244,00:14:44,00:14:47,At 9:52 p.m.
245,00:14:47,00:14:48,Patrol found her just after 11:00.
246,00:14:49,00:14:50,I'll start at the steakhouse and backtrack.
247,00:15:17,00:15:19,Hey. Hey.
248,00:15:19,00:15:21,What? Have you been shaving with a broken beer bottle?
249,00:15:21,00:15:26,"No, no. Some drunk driver ran into a radio car at my crime scene. Friggin' idiot."
250,00:15:26,00:15:30,Yeah. I heard you pulled the friggin' idiot's friend out of a burning car.
251,00:15:30,00:15:31,Nothing was on fire.
252,00:15:31,00:15:32,I didn't pull anybody from anywhere.
253,00:15:32,00:15:34,"Oh, so humble."
254,00:15:34,00:15:36,"You know, some people are just destined for greatness."
255,00:15:36,00:15:41,"Run these against the paint chips from the body, please."
256,00:15:41,00:15:47,Sure. You mean the engine black over canary yellow paint chips from a Ford automobile? Yeah.
257,00:15:47,00:15:49,"If I had a yellow car, I'd paint over it, too."
258,00:15:49,00:15:52,So the victimwashit by a car.
259,00:15:55,00:15:57,Steakhouse called Faith Maroney a cab.
260,00:15:58,00:16:00,They have a direct line to this place.
261,00:16:00,00:16:02,"Well, the car that hit her was yellow and black."
262,00:16:02,00:16:06,"Paint color's not going to help us narrow it down any, is it? No."
263,00:16:06,00:16:07,You guys from Strip-O-Gram?
264,00:16:07,00:16:09,Excuse me?
265,00:16:09,00:16:18,"'Cause last year, for my birthday, a cop showed up with a phony badge, started tearing his clothes off and trying to rub up on me."
266,00:16:18,00:16:20,I'm an excellent tipper.
267,00:16:20,00:16:23,"Well, I'm sure you are, but, uh, no, ma'am, we're not dancers."
268,00:16:23,00:16:24,We're here about the warrant.
269,00:16:24,00:16:27,"Okay, then."
270,00:16:27,00:16:30,So we dispatched 20 cabs to Diane's Steakhouse last night.
271,00:16:30,00:16:31,Around 10:00?
272,00:16:31,00:16:33,Received a call at 10:01.
273,00:16:33,00:16:35,Dispatched number 29.
274,00:16:35,00:16:36,Chandru Kambhatla.
275,00:16:37,00:16:38,He doesn't come on until 8:00.
276,00:16:38,00:16:41,"Well, we're going to need to see that cab and your trip sheet."
277,00:16:41,00:16:43,Number 29's right there.
278,00:16:43,00:16:45,Keys are inside.
279,00:16:45,00:16:50,"No joy riding, and don't leave the doors off like you did last time."
280,00:16:50,00:16:52,"Hey, we just take them apart."
281,00:16:52,00:16:53,"We don't put them back together, now."
282,00:16:53,00:16:56,That's why nobody likes to deal with your asses!
283,00:16:56,00:16:58,(both laughing)
284,00:17:02,00:17:04,"Hey, Nick, there's a camera in here."
285,00:17:05,00:17:08,Maybe that'll be able to tell us if Princess Pickpocket was one of his fares.
286,00:17:13,00:17:16,Front bumper screens positive for blood.
287,00:17:16,00:17:18,Hey.
288,00:17:18,00:17:22,"I got robbed last week, filed a report."
289,00:17:22,00:17:24,How come you're helping Chandru and not me?
290,00:17:24,00:17:26,"This isn't a robbery, sir."
291,00:17:26,00:17:27,"Then, what is it?"
292,00:17:27,00:17:28,Do you know the guy that drives this cab?
293,00:17:29,00:17:30,Sure.
294,00:17:30,00:17:31,You see him last night? I had to cut out early.
295,00:17:32,00:17:33,My wife's sick.
296,00:17:33,00:17:34,"But, uh, Dru's solid."
297,00:17:34,00:17:37,Got to respect a guy who comes here and wants to be legit.
298,00:17:37,00:17:41,"Goes to work, pays his taxes, studying to be a citizen."
299,00:17:41,00:17:43,"If you want to know about state capitals, you just ask Dru."
300,00:17:43,00:17:47,Did you know that Vegas is not the capital of Nevada?
301,00:17:47,00:17:49,"Thanks for the info, fellas."
302,00:17:49,00:17:51,Go get 'em.
303,00:18:02,00:18:04,(siren wailing in distance)
304,00:18:04,00:18:07,WILLOWS: The substance that I found under the saloon window was chewing tobacco.
305,00:18:08,00:18:08,The night watchman chews.
306,00:18:09,00:18:10,"Yeah, Vernon Porter."
307,00:18:10,00:18:12,He was fired from the force back in Chicago.
308,00:18:12,00:18:13,"Yeah, I know, I checked him out. Oh."
309,00:18:13,00:18:15,He got in an off-duty incident.
310,00:18:15,00:18:19,He was in a fight in a bar and a woman was hospitalized.
311,00:18:19,00:18:20,I'm thinking he had a front row seat.
312,00:18:20,00:18:23,"Well, you know, it fits his profile."
313,00:18:23,00:18:26,He could have waited till Heather's client left-- there's always a client... Yeah.
314,00:18:26,00:18:28,...and then attacked her.
315,00:18:28,00:18:31,"You know, I should have checked to see if he was wearing underwear."
316,00:18:31,00:18:33,There's no way that he could afford her.
317,00:18:33,00:18:35,So why would Heather cover for him?
318,00:18:35,00:18:37,Unless he's just a witness.
319,00:18:37,00:18:41,"Well, you want to see a man about a horse?"
320,00:18:44,00:18:46,GRISSOM: Any results on Heather Kessler?
321,00:18:46,00:18:48,"So far, all the prints come back to her."
322,00:18:48,00:18:51,"Player piano, whiskey bottle, shot glass."
323,00:18:51,00:18:54,There was some lipstick around the rim.
324,00:18:54,00:18:56,I haven't had a chance to test it.
325,00:18:56,00:18:58,You think it's her shade?
326,00:18:58,00:19:06,"Heather's not supposed to drink because of her diabetes, which could explain the hypoglycemia and shock."
327,00:19:06,00:19:10,Catherine found a pair of men's underwear in the toilet.
328,00:19:10,00:19:18,"Any evidence on them would have been washed away, but she also found seminal fluid in a tissue on the floor nearby."
329,00:19:18,00:19:19,She was sexually assaulted?
330,00:19:20,00:19:22,"She refused an SAE kit, so we'll never know."
331,00:19:22,00:19:27,"There were no defensive wounds, no skin or rope fibers under her nails."
332,00:19:27,00:19:33,"At first blush, I figured he might have ambushed her, except that I noted three separate strangulation attempts on her neck."
333,00:19:36,00:19:38,She had time to fight back.
334,00:19:38,00:19:40,This makes no sense.
335,00:19:40,00:19:41,She's very strong.
336,00:19:41,00:19:44,And tough as nails.
337,00:19:44,00:19:46,Why didn't she fight?
338,00:19:47,00:19:49,Gate's unlocked again.
339,00:19:49,00:19:51,"Well, it's ten after."
340,00:19:51,00:19:53,Probably unlocked 'cause he's doing his rounds.
341,00:19:53,00:19:54,Maybe.
342,00:19:54,00:19:55,"Ah, the Wild West, partner."
343,00:19:55,00:19:57,"Okay, come on, Jim, give it up."
344,00:19:57,00:20:00,I know you know something about Grissom and Lady Heather.
345,00:20:00,00:20:03,I know something a lot juicier than Grissom and Lady He...
346,00:20:14,00:20:16,"Oh, yeah, he's dead."
347,00:20:16,00:20:18,He took one in the back.
348,00:20:18,00:20:21,Who shot the sheriff?
349,00:20:24,00:20:26,(indistinct radio transmission)
350,00:20:26,00:20:29,Bullet entered through his back.
351,00:20:29,00:20:31,(grunts)
352,00:20:31,00:20:33,No exit wound.
353,00:20:34,00:20:36,There's some swelling under his lip.
354,00:20:37,00:20:39,"Ugh, disgusting."
355,00:20:39,00:20:41,You get mouth cancer from this.
356,00:20:41,00:20:42,"David, hand me his cell phone."
357,00:20:43,00:20:45,Sure.
358,00:20:45,00:20:47,Ruger Single Six.
359,00:20:49,00:20:52,Gun hasn't been fired.
360,00:20:52,00:20:53,Guess who he called yesterday?
361,00:20:53,00:20:55,Lady Heather.
362,00:20:55,00:20:59,Might have threatened her. And we both know how she likes to settle her own scores.
363,00:20:59,00:21:06,"I'm going to get a warrant, but it may take me some time because I have to find a judge who isn't a client of hers."
364,00:21:08,00:21:11,STOKES: You sure you've never seen her before?
365,00:21:11,00:21:12,You don't remember her?
366,00:21:12,00:21:15,"No, sir. That picture was taken by the camera inside your cab."
367,00:21:15,00:21:16,Why don't you take another look?
368,00:21:19,00:21:20,Recognize her now?
369,00:21:20,00:21:23,"You know, a lot of people get in my cab."
370,00:21:23,00:21:25,There's always a big convention in town.
371,00:21:25,00:21:29,"Hey. Dru. I was born at night, but not last night, okay?"
372,00:21:29,00:21:33,You picked her up at the steakhouse.
373,00:21:33,00:21:35,"I know the last time she was seen alive, was in your yellow cab."
374,00:21:35,00:21:38,I know she was killed by a yellow car.
375,00:21:38,00:21:40,I found blood on your front bumper.
376,00:21:40,00:21:43,"Okay, I, uh, I remember her now."
377,00:21:43,00:21:46,She wanted to go to MGM.
378,00:21:46,00:21:50,"There is bad traffic, so she tells me to let her out."
379,00:21:50,00:21:51,She wants to walk.
380,00:21:52,00:21:53,Where'd you let her out?
381,00:21:54,00:21:56,Near the Monte Carlo.
382,00:21:56,00:22:03,"Mr. Kambhatla, if I match the paint from your cab to the paint we found in her skull, do you realize how much trouble you're in?"
383,00:22:04,00:22:06,'Cause I'm not sure you really do.
384,00:22:08,00:22:09,Scotty.
385,00:22:17,00:22:19,JOHNSON: The older types of cameras only take stills.
386,00:22:19,00:22:23,They take them sequentially for 20 seconds any time a passenger door is opened.
387,00:22:23,00:22:24,Can you clarify the background?
388,00:22:24,00:22:25,Yeah.
389,00:22:28,00:22:30,NICK: I recognize the graphitti on that bench.
390,00:22:30,00:22:33,"That's the street we found her on, right there."
391,00:22:33,00:22:35,So Mr. Kambhatla was lying.
392,00:22:35,00:22:37,That's nowhere near the Monte Carlo.
393,00:22:42,00:22:43,Go back to number two.
394,00:22:44,00:22:47,The wallet in her hand is... black.
395,00:22:49,00:22:51,And her wallet was white.
396,00:22:53,00:22:55,"Go back, show me the last three photos, Archie."
397,00:22:55,00:22:56,Yeah.
398,00:22:56,00:22:58,"JOHNSON: Okay, so he's looking at her."
399,00:22:59,00:23:00,Looks down.
400,00:23:00,00:23:01,He's looking for something.
401,00:23:01,00:23:02,He looks up.
402,00:23:02,00:23:03,"STOKES: Well, he's pissed."
403,00:23:03,00:23:05,So shedidsnatch his wallet after all.
404,00:23:05,00:23:08,BROWN: And he ran her down and took it back.
405,00:23:08,00:23:10,"Well, we have him in custody."
406,00:23:10,00:23:12,We have his wallet.
407,00:23:12,00:23:15,"Let's, uh, go see if her prints are on it."
408,00:23:15,00:23:16,"Yeah. Thanks, Arch."
409,00:23:17,00:23:18,Yeah.
410,00:23:24,00:23:26,This window wasn't broken yesterday.
411,00:23:26,00:23:29,And I got a bullet in a poker player.
412,00:23:29,00:23:33,"Well, the one that killed Porter's still inside him."
413,00:23:33,00:23:34,Porter was shot in the back.
414,00:23:34,00:23:37,He was facing away from the saloon.
415,00:23:37,00:23:40,(gunshot)
416,00:23:40,00:23:44,"To get to the window, this bullet had to be fired from the opposite direction."
417,00:23:45,00:23:46,(gunshot)
418,00:23:47,00:23:49,There were two shooters.
419,00:23:55,00:23:58,Lead bullet. Cannelure.
420,00:23:58,00:23:59,We're looking for a revolver.
421,00:24:15,00:24:16,"Oh, wow."
422,00:24:17,00:24:20,WILLOWS: These look authentic.
423,00:24:20,00:24:22,All revolvers.
424,00:24:22,00:24:24,Case is unlocked.
425,00:24:26,00:24:28,I'll get the guns to ballistics.
426,00:24:28,00:24:30,I'll process the ammo boxes.
427,00:24:30,00:24:35,"Sofia, Faith Maroney's prints were found on the cab driver's wallet so there's your motive."
428,00:24:35,00:24:36,No problem.
429,00:24:46,00:24:49,The paint from the dead girl's skull matched the paint on Chandru's cab.
430,00:24:49,00:24:51,Page two.
431,00:24:53,00:24:57,The paint chips from the street arenota match to the paint chips from her skull.
432,00:24:57,00:24:58,Are you sure about this?
433,00:24:58,00:25:02,I just finished a diabolical soduku in six minutes flat.
434,00:25:02,00:25:03,I'm positive.
435,00:25:03,00:25:05,Then what color were the other paint chips?
436,00:25:05,00:25:07,What did you have for lunch?
437,00:25:07,00:25:08,Ihad a ham sandwich.
438,00:25:08,00:25:09,Hmm?
439,00:25:09,00:25:11,It's a clue.
440,00:25:11,00:25:12,Your sandwich.
441,00:25:13,00:25:14,Oh.
442,00:25:14,00:25:20,"The paint chips you collected are from two different cars, stuck together as a result of impact."
443,00:25:20,00:25:22,"Yellow paint, black paint, clear coat."
444,00:25:22,00:25:26,"The other half-- clear coat, black paint, yellow paint, clear coat, white."
445,00:25:26,00:25:30,That's a lot of canary yellow and engine black.
446,00:25:30,00:25:31,Cab-on-cab hate?
447,00:25:31,00:25:34,One half of the sandwich is from Dru's 29.
448,00:25:34,00:25:35,What about the other half?
449,00:25:35,00:25:38,You're looking for a white Ford that's been repainted yellow and black.
450,00:25:38,00:25:41,Sweet.
451,00:25:41,00:25:43,I'm glad I figured that out.
452,00:25:43,00:25:47,C.O.D.'s a single gunshot wound to the lower lumbar region.
453,00:25:47,00:25:50,Bullet entered here and then traveled slightly upward.
454,00:25:50,00:25:52,Whereisthe bullet?
455,00:25:52,00:25:53,"Well, that's the fun part."
456,00:25:53,00:25:55,He didn't die from the initial wound.
457,00:25:55,00:26:00,It entered through his back and then penetrated the inferior vena cava.
458,00:26:00,00:26:02,(gunshot)
459,00:26:02,00:26:06,It traveled throughthatvessel into his right lung.
460,00:26:06,00:26:08,It's called a bullet embolus.
461,00:26:08,00:26:09,and it's hard to find.
462,00:26:09,00:26:12,Most medical examiners would have missed it.
463,00:26:15,00:26:18,"Full metal jacket, nine millimeter."
464,00:26:18,00:26:21,The bullet that I found at the saloon was from a revolver.
465,00:26:21,00:26:22,Colt single-action Army.
466,00:26:22,00:26:24,The gun that won the west.
467,00:26:24,00:26:28,"That bullet is from a 20th century, high-capacity, semi-automatic pistol."
468,00:26:28,00:26:30,I... see a lot of bullets.
469,00:26:39,00:26:41,(sighs)
470,00:26:41,00:26:47,"Well, it looks like Friendly bought a small fleet of white cabs from another company last year that went belly-up."
471,00:26:47,00:26:49,How small are we talking?
472,00:26:51,00:26:53,Seventy-five.
473,00:26:53,00:26:56,Paint samples from 75 cabs?
474,00:26:56,00:26:59,"Well, we'll be back in the lab by next week."
475,00:27:35,00:27:36,"Hey, Warrick."
476,00:27:36,00:27:39,I got what looks like fresh damage over here.
477,00:27:44,00:27:45,Do we know that guy?
478,00:27:48,00:27:50,JOHNSON: Gus's cab is equipped with a new camera.
479,00:27:50,00:27:52,"Video, not stills."
480,00:27:52,00:27:53,Motion-activated.
481,00:27:53,00:27:55,"So the impact turns it on, huh?"
482,00:27:55,00:27:57,STOKES: Freeze that and grab a number off that cab.
483,00:28:00,00:28:03,JOHNSON: 7029-- that's Dru's cab.
484,00:28:04,00:28:07,"If Dru was dispatched, then what was Gus doing at that steakhouse?"
485,00:28:07,00:28:11,"Well, he had to be staging, trying to steal Dru's fare."
486,00:28:11,00:28:13,Looks like Gus took the fight to the streets.
487,00:28:13,00:28:14,He hit him again right there.
488,00:28:16,00:28:18,BROWN: Whoa.
489,00:28:18,00:28:19,"Well, that's the corner."
490,00:28:20,00:28:25,And we know from the paint chips we found on the ground that Gus's cab collided with Dru's on that street.
491,00:28:25,00:28:29,"Well, the airbags didn't deploy, so he must have been going under 15 miles an hour."
492,00:28:29,00:28:33,"I can't see Dru's cab, so Gus must have rear-ended him when he was stopped."
493,00:28:33,00:28:34,STOKES: It's physics.
494,00:28:35,00:28:42,Gus's cab transferred most of its energy into Dru's-- more than enough to launch him into the girl.
495,00:28:42,00:28:49,"and car bumpers are designed to absorb the impact from another vehicle, but the bumper hitting her?"
496,00:28:49,00:28:50,Would have been like a...
497,00:28:50,00:28:52,elephant hitting a flea.
498,00:28:53,00:28:55,You were in the wrong.
499,00:28:55,00:28:56,You were the one who was staging.
500,00:28:56,00:28:59,So why road rage Mr. Kambhatla?
501,00:28:59,00:29:02,Because he was gonna report it and get me fired.
502,00:29:02,00:29:04,I'm two months from retirement.
503,00:29:04,00:29:05,My wife's got MS.
504,00:29:05,00:29:07,Ineedmy health benefits.
505,00:29:07,00:29:10,But I didn't hit that girl.
506,00:29:10,00:29:12,He did.
507,00:29:12,00:29:14,STOKES: It's a bad neighborhood.
508,00:29:14,00:29:15,Nothing's open out there.
509,00:29:16,00:29:17,So why'd you drop her off?
510,00:29:17,00:29:23,"She was screaming at me, ""Screw you, pull over."" Sorry."
511,00:29:23,00:29:25,You guys are crazy. I want out of this cab right now.
512,00:29:27,00:29:29,"$6.25, please."
513,00:29:29,00:29:31,No way. I'm not paying for this ride.
514,00:29:32,00:29:33,"Hey, wait!"
515,00:29:34,00:29:35,You're a tease!
516,00:29:35,00:29:36,Give me back my wallet!
517,00:29:40,00:29:41,He tries to steal my fare.
518,00:29:41,00:29:44,"She tries to steal my wallet, and I am arrested."
519,00:29:44,00:29:46,So why didn't you just report the accident?
520,00:29:46,00:29:48,"You hit a pedestrian, it is always your fault."
521,00:29:48,00:29:54,"Hey, you were stopped and Gus hit you, pushing your cab into her."
522,00:29:54,00:29:56,"Now, that's not your fault."
523,00:29:56,00:29:57,Okay?
524,00:29:57,00:29:59,Gus said it was.
525,00:29:59,00:30:02,And he has been driving for 30 years.
526,00:30:02,00:30:05,"My cab hit her, so I am guilty."
527,00:30:05,00:30:07,"Yeah, well, Gus doesn't know the law, but I do."
528,00:30:07,00:30:11,What else did he say to you?
529,00:30:11,00:30:16,"Mr. Kambhatla, this may be the last chance you have to tell me the truth, now."
530,00:30:20,00:30:22,We made a deal.
531,00:30:22,00:30:24,Okay. Okay. What kind of deal?
532,00:30:24,00:30:35,"He said if I don't report him for staging, and hitting me, then he would keep quiet about me hitting the girl."
533,00:30:38,00:30:41,And I can stay in this country...
534,00:30:41,00:30:43,with my mother and sisters.
535,00:30:43,00:30:47,I need to be here to make money for them.
536,00:30:47,00:30:50,I'm telling the truth now.
537,00:30:50,00:30:52,"Is going to be okay, right?"
538,00:30:52,00:30:55,"No, sir, unfortunately, that's not the way it works."
539,00:30:55,00:31:01,"I've got you for obstruction, for fleeing the scene, and now you're an accessory."
540,00:31:01,00:31:03,"I'm sorry, man."
541,00:31:03,00:31:06,"I know you're confused, but..."
542,00:31:06,00:31:08,you just made a deal with the wrong guy.
543,00:31:23,00:31:24,This isn't a good time.
544,00:31:24,00:31:26,We have a warrant to search your house.
545,00:31:26,00:31:29,And you'd better put some sunblock on because we're going downtown.
546,00:31:29,00:31:32,My memory isn't any better than it was yesterday.
547,00:31:32,00:31:35,I'm not up to it.
548,00:31:35,00:31:36,"Well, we'll swing by the hospital."
549,00:31:36,00:31:41,"And you can explain to them why you checked yourself out early, against doctor's orders."
550,00:31:41,00:31:43,We're investigating a homicide.
551,00:31:43,00:31:45,I don't understand.
552,00:31:45,00:31:46,Where were you last night?
553,00:31:46,00:31:48,You may come in.
554,00:31:51,00:31:53,I was here.
555,00:31:54,00:31:56,Can anyone verify that?
556,00:31:56,00:31:59,Preferably someone not on the payroll.
557,00:32:01,00:32:03,Captain Brass would like to know where I was last night.
558,00:32:07,00:32:09,She was here.
559,00:32:10,00:32:12,GRISSOM: With me.
560,00:32:25,00:32:27,WILLOWS: You were there all night.
561,00:32:27,00:32:30,Want to explain why?
562,00:32:30,00:32:39,"Look, I know that you don't go home and cuddle your insects every single night, but why would you go there knowing that we're in the middle of an investigation?"
563,00:32:39,00:32:41,And now she's a prime suspect with you as her alibi.
564,00:32:41,00:32:45,"It was a social call, that's all."
565,00:32:46,00:32:51,"So, when your personal life gets tangled up in a case, that's off limits?"
566,00:32:51,00:32:52,Yes.
567,00:32:52,00:32:54,Isn't that a little hypocritical?
568,00:32:54,00:32:56,Apparently so.
569,00:32:56,00:32:59,"You know I'd slap you, but I think you'd enjoy it too much."
570,00:33:01,00:33:04,"Look, I went to Heather's on a hunch."
571,00:33:04,00:33:09,There's something not right with her.
572,00:33:13,00:33:14,Your timing sucked.
573,00:33:17,00:33:19,What's this?
574,00:33:20,00:33:23,So now you're building your own?
575,00:33:23,00:33:24,Yeah.
576,00:33:24,00:33:26,Keeps my hands busy.
577,00:33:26,00:33:32,You think I paid someone to kill Porter and then used Grissom as my alibi?
578,00:33:32,00:33:34,"And with your history, yes."
579,00:33:34,00:33:35,How do you know Vernon Porter?
580,00:33:35,00:33:37,He did some work for me.
581,00:33:37,00:33:38,I helped him get the job at Oakley's.
582,00:33:38,00:33:42,You know what? That's the first thing you said to me that doesn't sound like a lie.
583,00:33:42,00:33:43,What kind of work?
584,00:33:43,00:33:45,I needed to locate someone.
585,00:33:45,00:33:47,So an ex-cop does some legwork for you.
586,00:33:47,00:33:50,So what happened-- did you have a falling out or he threaten you?
587,00:33:50,00:33:51,(keypad beeping)
588,00:33:51,00:33:53,ELECTRONIC VOICE: First skipped message.
589,00:33:53,00:33:55,Received yesterday at 12:02 p.m.
590,00:33:55,00:33:57,"MAN: Hey, Heather, Vernon."
591,00:33:57,00:33:59,Looks like you got yourself into something.
592,00:33:59,00:34:00,"If you need anything, call me."
593,00:34:01,00:34:04,Call me anyway. Let me know you're okay.
594,00:34:04,00:34:07,"Does that sound like a man who wants to hurt me, Captain Brass?"
595,00:34:07,00:34:08,"Oh, I don't know, Heather. I don't know."
596,00:34:08,00:34:14,"I mean, you get assaulted at Old West Town where he works, he calls it in, then he ends up dead."
597,00:34:14,00:34:16,"What is it, just one big coincidence?"
598,00:34:16,00:34:18,I already told you I was there on business.
599,00:34:18,00:34:20,Mr. Porter had nothing to do with it.
600,00:34:20,00:34:21,"Yeah, but it was your business that got him killed."
601,00:34:22,00:34:25,"Come on, come on, we both know that you weren't there for some Western hoedown."
602,00:34:25,00:34:26,So what were you doing there?
603,00:34:29,00:34:33,The semen on the tissue in the bathroom did not come from Vernon Porter.
604,00:34:33,00:34:38,"Well, the underwear that I pulled from the toilet was a 38-inch waist."
605,00:34:38,00:34:39,Porter was a 34.
606,00:34:39,00:34:40,He didn't attack Heather.
607,00:34:40,00:34:42,But we know he was there.
608,00:34:42,00:34:49,One of Heather's clients pays for a kinky Wild West fantasy only to discover he had an audience?
609,00:34:49,00:34:52,"Well, I don't want to derail this, but why kill Porter and not go after Heather?"
610,00:34:52,00:34:53,'Cause she's not talking.
611,00:34:53,00:34:55,Her business is based on discretion.
612,00:34:55,00:34:57,Couldn't count on Porter's discretion.
613,00:34:57,00:34:58,(ring tone playing)
614,00:34:58,00:35:02,So this client goes back to Oakley's the next night and shoots Porter.
615,00:35:03,00:35:07,"Oh, Mandy got a hit off the revolver and the ammo box."
616,00:35:07,00:35:09,Benjamin Oakley.
617,00:35:09,00:35:10,His family owns the place.
618,00:35:11,00:35:12,He had access.
619,00:35:12,00:35:14,"Yeah, I'm calling Brass."
620,00:35:14,00:35:16,Sara will fill you in.
621,00:35:16,00:35:18,WILLOWS: Jim...
622,00:35:19,00:35:20,We may have a suspect.
623,00:35:26,00:35:29,I'm the only one Heather trusts.
624,00:35:29,00:35:31,I get it.
625,00:35:33,00:35:34,Sara...
626,00:35:36,00:35:37,Yeah?
627,00:35:39,00:35:41,It's fine.
628,00:35:41,00:35:43,Do what you need to do.
629,00:35:54,00:36:01,"HEATHER: When the submissive accepts they're in control, that's when they embrace their true power."
630,00:36:01,00:36:06,"They can say ""stop."" They can choose to either end the pain or continue enduring it."
631,00:36:06,00:36:07,But...
632,00:36:07,00:36:11,higher consciousness doesn't negate our animal instinct to survive.
633,00:36:12,00:36:15,"Dr. Grissom, you requested a custody file from the court."
634,00:36:15,00:36:17,"Thank you, Judy."
635,00:36:17,00:36:21,I'm assuming it's for your investigation into the Miniature Killer.
636,00:36:21,00:36:25,Everybody in the lab believes you're gonna get him.
637,00:37:02,00:37:05,She's all I have left of Zoe.
638,00:37:05,00:37:08,Can you tell if she's ever given birth?
639,00:37:08,00:37:15,"There was some scarring on her pelvic bones, but given the condition of the body, it's hard to say for sure."
640,00:37:15,00:37:17,GRISSOM: This is your granddaughter.
641,00:37:17,00:37:19,Did you take this picture?
642,00:37:19,00:37:21,I hired someone to find her.
643,00:37:23,00:37:28,"I can't give her love, but I can give her the freedom to be who she wants to be."
644,00:37:33,00:37:36,Is this official police business?
645,00:37:36,00:37:37,No.
646,00:37:37,00:37:39,Did Heather send you?
647,00:37:39,00:37:41,"No, I'm just a friend of hers."
648,00:37:41,00:37:44,Did she tell you about me?
649,00:37:44,00:37:46,Not really.
650,00:37:46,00:37:47,We were married very young.
651,00:37:47,00:37:49,Didn't last long.
652,00:37:49,00:37:53,Heather left without telling me she was pregnant.
653,00:37:53,00:37:58,I wasn't aware I had a child until after Zoe was already dead.
654,00:38:00,00:38:03,"That's Zoe's daughter, Heather's granddaughter."
655,00:38:03,00:38:06,Her name is Alison.
656,00:38:06,00:38:09,So why are you here?
657,00:38:09,00:38:11,I'm just trying to understand what's happening to her.
658,00:38:11,00:38:14,(girl speaking indistinctly)
659,00:38:14,00:38:21,I'm aware that the court has denied her visitation rights.
660,00:38:21,00:38:23,Wouldn't you?
661,00:38:23,00:38:25,I'm not sure.
662,00:38:27,00:38:30,Has Heather tried to give you any money for Alison?
663,00:38:30,00:38:33,"Yes, the day before yesterday I got a call from the bank."
664,00:38:33,00:38:39,"Heather had set up a very generous trust fund for her, no strings attached."
665,00:38:39,00:38:41,I assumed she sold her house.
666,00:38:41,00:38:43,Can you tell me how much?
667,00:38:43,00:38:46,"$843,508."
668,00:38:46,00:38:54,"I know Heather had closed her business a few months ago trying to convince the judge she'd be a fit guardian, so it had to be from the sale."
669,00:38:55,00:39:05,"I wonder if she calculated the exact amount it would cost to raise a child and put her through college, especially at Harvard."
670,00:39:05,00:39:10,That's where she sent Zoe.
671,00:39:13,00:39:16,But it wasn't her house that she sold.
672,00:39:21,00:39:23,You took a shot at Porter.
673,00:39:23,00:39:25,That's attempted murder.
674,00:39:25,00:39:29,"Your dad's not going to like that, Benny."
675,00:39:29,00:39:31,This is a warrant for your DNA.
676,00:39:31,00:39:33,Why do you need my DNA?
677,00:39:33,00:39:36,To prove that you also attacked Heather Kessler.
678,00:39:36,00:39:37,BRASS: And that makes two attempted murders.
679,00:39:37,00:39:40,"And that adds up to a lot of jail time, bud."
680,00:39:41,00:39:42,Open up.
681,00:39:42,00:39:44,"I didn't touch her, okay?"
682,00:39:44,00:39:46,I didn't kill Porter.
683,00:39:46,00:39:47,"What do you want, a gold star for being a bad shot?"
684,00:39:48,00:39:50,(sighs)
685,00:39:50,00:39:51,Porter knew I lied.
686,00:39:51,00:39:53,He wanted 50 grand to keep his mouth shut.
687,00:39:53,00:39:55,And I was gonna pay him.
688,00:39:55,00:39:59,"I went to the bank to get the money, but somebody drained the account."
689,00:39:59,00:40:01,There was a million dollars in that account last week.
690,00:40:01,00:40:02,Who authorized the transfer?
691,00:40:02,00:40:04,Jack Oakley.
692,00:40:04,00:40:07,I went there to kill my father.
693,00:40:07,00:40:12,"I knew he was going to meet Heather, but for some reason, she didn't show."
694,00:40:12,00:40:15,And Porter got up the courage to ask my dad for the money.
695,00:40:15,00:40:18,He'd seen my father with Heather.
696,00:40:18,00:40:19,You sick bastard!
697,00:40:19,00:40:21,"You got 24 hours, then I turn you in!"
698,00:40:23,00:40:25,(gunshot)
699,00:40:33,00:40:35,The Marquis de Sade's got nothing on my old man.
700,00:40:35,00:40:38,Inflicting pain is his idea of foreplay.
701,00:40:38,00:40:41,"You're your mother's son, not mine."
702,00:40:43,00:40:47,Do you know how much money he spent abusing women?
703,00:40:47,00:40:53,He didn't leave anything for my mother and me except for more abuse.
704,00:40:54,00:40:57,It had to stop.
705,00:40:57,00:40:59,Where is he?
706,00:40:59,00:41:01,"His phone's off; every time his phone's off, he's with her."
707,00:41:01,00:41:02,Is he at the saloon?
708,00:41:02,00:41:04,"No, he wouldn't do that, not after Porter."
709,00:41:04,00:41:07,He's got to be at Heather's.
710,00:41:07,00:41:11,(siren wails in distance)
711,00:41:11,00:41:15,BRASS: So your sick fantasy was to kill her.
712,00:41:15,00:41:17,I didn't do anything.
713,00:41:17,00:41:19,She solicited me.
714,00:41:19,00:41:20,Strictly a business deal.
715,00:41:21,00:41:23,She needed the money.
716,00:41:23,00:41:27,"I paid her close to $1 million for this, you know that?"
717,00:41:27,00:41:29,That's about all I'm gonna say.
718,00:41:29,00:41:32,I'll be talking with my lawyer.
719,00:41:35,00:41:37,Too bad you spent the million.
720,00:41:37,00:41:39,You could use it on your defense.
721,00:41:42,00:41:46,"Look, Heather, for what it's worth, I think you're in the clear."
722,00:41:46,00:41:48,The D.A.'s not gonna press charges.
723,00:41:49,00:41:54,"Attempted murder, assisted suicide, the lines are kind of blurred."
724,00:41:54,00:41:56,But do yourself a favor.
725,00:41:56,00:41:58,Get some help.
726,00:42:03,00:42:04,(siren blips)
727,00:42:04,00:42:07,(indistinct radio communication)
728,00:42:15,00:42:16,(knocking)
729,00:42:23,00:42:25,Leave me alone.
730,00:42:25,00:42:28,I didn't ask you to save me.
731,00:42:28,00:42:31,I know.
732,00:42:31,00:42:33,What am I supposed to do? I'm your friend.
733,00:42:36,00:42:39,"Besides, there's someone I want you to meet."
