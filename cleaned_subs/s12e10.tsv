0	00:00:00	00:00:02	911. What is your emergency?
1	00:00:02	00:00:04	No, I can't give you directions to the Luxor.
2	00:00:04	00:00:07	Look for the searchlight pointing straight up.
3	00:00:07	00:00:08	You can't miss it.
4	00:00:08	00:00:10	Sir, this line is for emergencies only.
5	00:00:10	00:00:11	911. What is your emergency?
6	00:00:11	00:00:13	911. What is your emergency?
7	00:00:13	00:00:16	No, ma'am, the fire department won't fish a rat out of your pool.
8	00:00:16	00:00:19	Even if it's the size of a dog.
9	00:00:19	00:00:21	911. What is your emergency?
10	00:00:21	00:00:22	There's a dead man in my bed.
11	00:00:22	00:00:24	And how do you know he's dead?
12	00:00:24	00:00:27	I performed CPR, but he's not... he's not breathing.
13	00:00:27	00:00:28	There's no heartbeat.
14	00:00:28	00:00:31	Okay, ma'am, I have you at 5415 Deertrail in Henderson.
15	00:00:31	00:00:32	That's right.
16	00:00:32	00:00:35	I'll send officers out right away, and I'll notify the coroner.
17	00:00:35	00:00:38	Don't worry about the coroner.
18	00:00:38	00:00:40	I'll call him.
19	00:00:58	00:01:00	We need to keep Doc out of here.
20	00:01:04	00:01:06	This will tear his heart out.
21	00:01:06	00:01:09	Yeah, been there before. Well, then again, maybe it's not what it looks like.
22	00:01:09	00:01:11	Well...
23	00:01:11	00:01:13	a cheating wife and her dead lover?
24	00:01:13	00:01:15	You see something I don't see? Yeah.
25	00:01:15	00:01:17	A crime scene that has yet to be processed.
26	00:02:00	00:02:01	Hey, Doc.
27	00:02:01	00:02:03	Hey, D.B.
28	00:02:03	00:02:05	We've got a crime scene.
29	00:02:05	00:02:07	And you're delivering a personal invitation?
30	00:02:07	00:02:10	Your wife's fine. What are you talking about?
31	00:02:10	00:02:14	The crime scene is at your house, Doc.
32	00:02:21	00:02:26	So you and, uh, Dan Traxler--right-- were doing research.
33	00:02:26	00:02:27	Yes, that's-- that's right.
34	00:02:27	00:02:31	So what'd you do, um, take off all your clothes and jump into bed for research?
35	00:02:31	00:02:33	I don't appreciate where you're going with this, Jim.
36	00:02:33	00:02:36	Judy, explain how a naked man ended up dead in your bed.
37	00:02:36	00:02:37	I can't.
38	00:02:37	00:02:39	We were talking in the living room.
39	00:02:39	00:02:40	I got a phone call.
40	00:02:40	00:02:41	Hey, hon.
41	00:02:41	00:02:44	Our grandson has colic, and it's driving our daughter crazy.
42	00:02:44	00:02:46	We must have talked for almost 20 minutes.
43	00:02:46	00:02:48	Where was Traxler at this time?
44	00:02:48	00:02:51	In the living room, but when I walked back inside, he was gone.
45	00:02:51	00:02:53	I'm sorry. I just...
46	00:02:53	00:02:58	Dan's not the kind of person who just up and leaves, so I called his cell phone. (cell phone ringing)
47	00:03:02	00:03:04	I don't know.
48	00:03:04	00:03:06	I thought maybe he got the wrong idea about us.
49	00:03:06	00:03:10	You know, because of the wine, or I-I don't know, I might have hugged him.
50	00:03:10	00:03:12	Judy, if you were having an affair, just cop to it.
51	00:03:12	00:03:13	It can't get any worse than this.
52	00:03:43	00:03:45	This is just so terrible. I...
53	00:03:45	00:03:47	Dave, just try and stay focused.
54	00:03:47	00:03:48	Okay.
55	00:03:48	00:03:50	Is it okay if I...
56	00:03:50	00:03:52	swab his face?
57	00:03:52	00:03:54	Yeah, go ahead.
58	00:03:59	00:04:02	You know they celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary in October?
59	00:04:04	00:04:06	Want to talk about how he died?
60	00:04:06	00:04:08	Yeah.
61	00:04:11	00:04:14	There's no obvious injuries.
62	00:04:19	00:04:20	Dan Traxler, 45 years old.
63	00:04:20	00:04:22	He's not her type.
64	00:04:22	00:04:24	Yeah, what type is that? Doc.
65	00:04:25	00:04:27	Doc Robbins is her type.
66	00:04:29	00:04:30	95 degrees.
67	00:04:30	00:04:31	He hasn't been dead long.
68	00:04:31	00:04:32	Maybe a couple hours.
69	00:04:36	00:04:37	There's blood in the mouth.
70	00:04:37	00:04:39	Maybe he bit his lip.
71	00:04:39	00:04:43	Yeah, but you usually don't find blood with a heart attack.
72	00:04:43	00:04:45	Al. God.
73	00:04:45	00:04:48	I'm so glad you're here. No, no, no. No, wait here. Wait here.
74	00:04:50	00:04:51	I'm sorry, Al.
75	00:04:51	00:04:53	You got to back off and let us do our job.
76	00:04:53	00:04:56	Jim, I need to speak to my wife. I can't let you do that.
77	00:04:56	00:04:58	Please. Sorry.
78	00:04:58	00:04:59	Let me talk to him.
79	00:04:59	00:05:01	I'll fill you in, okay?
80	00:05:06	00:05:08	Okay, no sign of forced entry.
81	00:05:08	00:05:10	The neighbors didn't see or hear anything.
82	00:05:10	00:05:15	The victim's car was parked a block away and had been ticketed before.
83	00:05:15	00:05:17	What are you thinking-- an affair?
84	00:05:17	00:05:19	Well, yeah, yeah.
85	00:05:19	00:05:21	I mean, I think the guy crapped out in bed, right?
86	00:05:21	00:05:23	And she's not coming clean because she knows all of us.
87	00:05:23	00:05:25	Greg, you got anything to add?
88	00:05:25	00:05:28	Yeah. There's, uh, blood in the guy's mouth.
89	00:05:28	00:05:29	Hadn't gone there. All right.
90	00:05:29	00:05:31	Well, we need backup.
91	00:05:31	00:05:33	We got to play this smart, treat it as a homicide.
92	00:05:33	00:05:35	I need to take Judy downtown.
93	00:05:35	00:05:37	Okay. Let me process her first.
94	00:05:39	00:05:42	She said she was on her cell phone when whatever happened happened.
95	00:05:42	00:05:45	You might want to check that out.
96	00:05:45	00:05:47	Mrs. Robbins. Yes.
97	00:05:47	00:05:52	D.B. Russell. I-I am so sorry that we have to meet under these circumstances. Yeah.
98	00:05:52	00:05:54	I'm going to need to see your cell phone.
99	00:05:54	00:05:57	Yes.
100	00:05:57	00:05:58	And who... who's Pam?
101	00:05:58	00:06:00	Pam is our daughter.
102	00:06:00	00:06:02	That was a long phone call. Yeah.
103	00:06:02	00:06:03	Where'd you take it? Um...
104	00:06:03	00:06:05	I was in the back, on the lanai.
105	00:06:05	00:06:06	Okay. Well, you relax.
106	00:06:06	00:06:07	We're gonna sort this out.
107	00:06:07	00:06:10	Thank you.
108	00:06:19	00:06:21	Hey, doll.
109	00:06:21	00:06:24	No, no, I'm... I'm at a scene.
110	00:06:26	00:06:28	No, it's okay. I-I can talk.
111	00:06:28	00:06:32	As a matter of fact, I can talk for about 20 minutes.
112	00:06:32	00:06:36	Gee, I wish you could see this.
113	00:06:36	00:06:39	Their geraniums are doing so much better than ours.
114	00:06:41	00:06:43	Hold on a sec.
115	00:06:51	00:06:55	I called, uh, Sylvia Sloane from days to do the post. Okay.
116	00:06:55	00:06:57	Um, I'll stay with the body.
117	00:06:57	00:06:59	Good.
118	00:06:59	00:07:01	Don't want any questions about how we handled this.
119	00:07:01	00:07:02	Right.
120	00:07:04	00:07:05	Doc...
121	00:07:15	00:07:16	Mrs. Robbins?
122	00:07:16	00:07:17	I'm CSI Brody.
123	00:07:17	00:07:19	I'm here to process you.
124	00:07:31	00:07:33	Doc.
125	00:07:33	00:07:35	Uh, you can't come in here.
126	00:07:35	00:07:37	Morgan's processing Judy.
127	00:07:37	00:07:40	Could you grab her something to wear out of that top drawer?
128	00:07:40	00:07:42	Uh, yeah.
129	00:07:42	00:07:43	I'll make sure she gets something.
130	00:07:47	00:07:50	Greg, do me a favor.
131	00:07:50	00:07:55	Run this scene for me-- Doc Robbins, coroner-- not Al Robbins, husband.
132	00:07:55	00:07:57	It... it's still early.
133	00:08:01	00:08:02	All right.
134	00:08:02	00:08:06	Our victim is a white male, 45.
135	00:08:06	00:08:08	Name's Dan Traxler.
136	00:08:08	00:08:12	He was found naked in bed, here, supine.
137	00:08:12	00:08:14	No traumatic injuries.
138	00:08:14	00:08:16	Blood on his teeth, gums.
139	00:08:16	00:08:19	ALS indicates semen.
140	00:08:22	00:08:23	That's her side of the bed.
141	00:08:23	00:08:25	What?
142	00:08:25	00:08:27	That's Judy's side of the bed.
143	00:08:27	00:08:31	25 years of marriage, and we never changed sides ever.
144	00:08:31	00:08:33	Ever.
145	00:08:33	00:08:34	Doc, you really got to go.
146	00:08:43	00:08:50	So I'm, uh, guessing by the increased personnel, Dan didn't die of a heart attack, huh?
147	00:08:51	00:08:54	May I see your hands, please?
148	00:08:56	00:08:58	Hey. Hey.
149	00:08:58	00:09:00	Hey.
150	00:09:00	00:09:04	Good thing about evidence-- it works both ways.
151	00:09:04	00:09:07	It can prove guilt, and it can prove innocence.
152	00:09:07	00:09:10	You know, Jim Brass didn't believe a thing I said.
153	00:09:10	00:09:16	If I was going to have an affair, I wouldn't be having it in my house, in my bed.
154	00:09:16	00:09:21	You know, every marriage has its problems, but that bed's sacred.
155	00:09:21	00:09:24	You cross that line, and there's no going back.
156	00:09:31	00:09:33	Her fingers are green, right?
157	00:09:34	00:09:36	How did you know that?
158	00:09:36	00:09:37	You deadhead, don't you?
159	00:09:37	00:09:40	That's what you were doing on the phone with your daughter?
160	00:09:40	00:09:41	Yes.
161	00:09:41	00:09:43	That's just sleep deprivation.
162	00:09:43	00:09:45	Strap him into the car.
163	00:09:45	00:09:46	Take him for a drive.
164	00:09:46	00:09:48	I'm sure that will put him to sleep.
165	00:09:48	00:09:50	Well, did he nap today?
166	00:09:54	00:09:56	Stems were still moist.
167	00:09:56	00:09:58	Just been pruned.
168	00:09:58	00:10:02	There was a pile of brown leaves on the table--about 20 minutes worth, as a matter of fact.
169	00:10:02	00:10:04	Best way to keep geraniums in bloom.
170	00:10:04	00:10:05	Ah. I knew there was a secret.
171	00:10:05	00:10:07	You know what to do, right?
172	00:10:07	00:10:10	Test for chlorophyll.
173	00:10:10	00:10:12	How are things between you and Judy?
174	00:10:12	00:10:13	Solid.
175	00:10:16	00:10:18	Did you know the victim, Dan Traxler?
176	00:10:18	00:10:20	No. Your wife knew him.
177	00:10:20	00:10:22	Judy's friends with a lot of people.
178	00:10:22	00:10:27	We found an ATM receipt last night with a large cash withdrawal.
179	00:10:27	00:10:29	Judy has girls' night out on Tuesdays.
180	00:10:29	00:10:31	Except, last night, she stayed in.
181	00:10:31	00:10:35	Are you investigating this incident, Jim, or my wife?
182	00:10:35	00:10:39	Look, Al, you know, you're not the only guy to get blindsided.
183	00:10:39	00:10:42	My ex-wife screwed around on me for a year.
184	00:10:42	00:10:43	Me. Go figure.
185	00:10:43	00:10:46	That's your marriage, not mine.
186	00:10:46	00:10:47	Oh, okay.
187	00:10:47	00:10:48	Well, consider this.
188	00:10:48	00:10:50	They're drinking wine.
189	00:10:50	00:10:52	They went from the living room to the bedroom.
190	00:10:52	00:10:54	I don't believe it was like that.
191	00:10:54	00:10:58	All right, look, this is more information than I'm prepared to give you anyway, okay, but I see a pattern here.
192	00:10:58	00:11:01	Judy's night out was Traxler's night in.
193	00:11:01	00:11:03	Th-There's got to be more than that.
194	00:11:03	00:11:08	Look, as my friend, I am asking you to broaden the scope of your investigation.
195	00:11:08	00:11:10	You gotta prepare yourself, Al.
196	00:11:10	00:11:12	because this is only gonna get worse.
197	00:11:12	00:11:14	No, you gotta prepare yourself to be wrong.
198	00:11:14	00:11:18	Your past is clouding your judgment, and I expect more than that from you.
199	00:11:24	00:11:26	You okay?
200	00:11:26	00:11:28	Want to take a minute?
201	00:11:34	00:11:37	Dr. Sloane...
202	00:11:37	00:11:38	what do we know?
203	00:11:38	00:11:42	Daniel Traxler is an otherwise healthy adult male.
204	00:11:42	00:11:43	No traumatic injuries.
205	00:11:43	00:11:45	No lacerations.
206	00:11:45	00:11:46	No broken bones.
207	00:11:46	00:11:48	Heart tissue shows no signs of ischemia or infarction.
208	00:11:48	00:11:50	So, no heart attack?
209	00:11:50	00:11:53	I sent blood samples to Tox, tissue sections to Histo-Path.
210	00:11:53	00:11:57	And the penile swab?
211	00:11:57	00:11:58	Sent it to DNA.
212	00:11:58	00:11:59	Did anything present?
213	00:12:02	00:12:04	Just this.
214	00:12:07	00:12:08	Frenulum is torn.
215	00:12:08	00:12:11	That explains the blood in his mouth.
216	00:12:11	00:12:12	He was smothered.
217	00:12:18	00:12:20	I'm sorry, Al.
218	00:12:20	00:12:22	This looks like a homicide.
219	00:12:33	00:12:35	Smothering is passive.
220	00:12:35	00:12:37	It's got female written all over it.
221	00:12:37	00:12:40	Can you just process the bathroom?
222	00:12:42	00:12:46	You know, if it was anybody else, I'd buy the whole cheating wife thing, but...
223	00:12:46	00:12:47	it's Doc.
224	00:12:47	00:12:49	He's amazing.
225	00:12:49	00:12:52	Nothing ever slows him down.
226	00:12:52	00:12:55	He's got this great outlook on life.
227	00:12:59	00:13:03	And every day he comes home and takes off his legs.
228	00:13:13	00:13:16	Sildenafil. Wow.
229	00:13:16	00:13:18	At least he's keeping up his end of the bargain.
230	00:13:18	00:13:20	Why would Judy do this to him?
231	00:13:20	00:13:23	Don't the Robbins have a cat--a gray tabby?
232	00:13:25	00:13:27	Yeah. Her name's Cinder.
233	00:13:27	00:13:33	The reason I know that is because that's the name of my first cat, who, ironically, died in a fire of mysterious origins.
234	00:13:33	00:13:36	My stepfather was allergic to cats.
235	00:13:36	00:13:43	I found a box of condoms under the sink where Doc couldn't see them. At least Judy cared enough about him not to give him a disease while she was screwing around.
236	00:13:43	00:13:45	Hodges, you need to shift it into neutral.
237	00:13:45	00:13:48	I'm gonna go look for that litter box.
238	00:14:19	00:14:21	(rattling) Cinder?
239	00:14:21	00:14:23	Hey, have you seen that cat?
240	00:14:23	00:14:25	I think I spooked it. Yeah.
241	00:14:25	00:14:27	He, uh, ran in that room.
242	00:14:27	00:14:29	What have you got?
243	00:14:29	00:14:31	Carpet impressions, but...
244	00:14:31	00:14:35	they're not the same shape or size as anything else in the room.
245	00:14:35	00:14:37	Maybe it's a table or a lamp.
246	00:14:37	00:14:40	Then it would've blocked the pathway to the sofa.
247	00:14:40	00:14:43	Well, whatever it was, it's not here now.
248	00:14:43	00:14:45	So, Judy...
249	00:14:45	00:14:47	Tell me more about Dan Traxler.
250	00:14:47	00:14:49	Uh, he was a-a genealogist.
251	00:14:49	00:14:53	I found him online when I was looking for somebody to do Al's family tree.
252	00:14:53	00:14:54	And when did the affair start?
253	00:14:54	00:14:56	There was no affair. Come on.
254	00:14:56	00:14:59	The lingerie, candles, romantic music...
255	00:14:59	00:15:01	Al and I like to keep things interesting.
256	00:15:01	00:15:05	Judy, you're not here because, you know, you're having an affair. I really don't care.
257	00:15:05	00:15:07	You're here because it's a homicide.
258	00:15:07	00:15:12	I did not cheat on my husband and I did not kill Dan.
259	00:15:12	00:15:14	Am I free to go?
260	00:15:14	00:15:16	Nope.
261	00:15:38	00:15:41	These marks were left on your living room rug.
262	00:15:41	00:15:43	Do you know what made them?
263	00:15:43	00:15:45	No.
264	00:15:45	00:15:49	Judy, whoever you're protecting, it's not gonna matter in the end.
265	00:15:49	00:15:53	Albert, I can't let you see her until I've confirmed your alibi.
266	00:15:53	00:15:58	Captain, I-I'd like to ask Mrs. Robbins a question, if that's cool with you.
267	00:15:58	00:16:01	As long as you don't pass notes from your new best friend.
268	00:16:06	00:16:09	Did Mr. Traxler bring anything to the house with him?
269	00:16:09	00:16:11	Uh, yes. He, uh...
270	00:16:11	00:16:13	brought a-a-a briefcase.
271	00:16:13	00:16:15	We didn't find a briefcase.
272	00:16:15	00:16:18	He definitely brought it into the house.
273	00:16:18	00:16:20	Was there anyone else in the house besides you and Mr. Traxler?
274	00:16:20	00:16:22	Yes.
275	00:16:22	00:16:23	Whoever killed him.
276	00:16:27	00:16:29	Hey. You were married.
277	00:16:29	00:16:32	Do you think it's odd that our dead genealogist was on Judy's side of the bed?
278	00:16:32	00:16:34	Well...
279	00:16:34	00:16:39	you choose a side early on in a relationship, and you pretty much stay there, unless you're...
280	00:16:39	00:16:42	mixing it up with some extracurricular.
281	00:16:43	00:16:45	Did you find semen?
282	00:16:45	00:16:46	Yeah.
283	00:16:46	00:16:48	Henry's testing it now.
284	00:16:48	00:16:51	We think that Traxler might have had a briefcase.
285	00:16:51	00:16:55	Only, Morgan and I weren't able to find one at the scene.
286	00:16:55	00:16:56	Judy have time to ditch it?
287	00:16:56	00:16:58	I don't see how she could.
288	00:16:58	00:17:00	She was on the phone for 20 minutes with her daughter.
289	00:17:00	00:17:04	Two minutes later she called Traxler's cell, and a minute after that, 911.
290	00:17:04	00:17:06	And they kept her on the phone until a patrol showed up.
291	00:17:06	00:17:13	Besides, why would she ditch his briefcase, but not blow out the candles in the bedroom, or turn off the Marvin Gaye?
292	00:17:13	00:17:15	(sighs) Wow.
293	00:17:15	00:17:16	Marvin Gaye?
294	00:17:16	00:17:18	Sexual Healing?
295	00:17:18	00:17:20	Why else would you play Marvin Gaye?
296	00:17:20	00:17:24	Well, if that briefcase is missing, it had to be important to someone.
297	00:17:24	00:17:27	You need to find out more about your dead genealogist.
298	00:17:29	00:17:37	And always get permission from the church or the cemetery administrator before you start any grave rubbing.
299	00:17:37	00:17:39	Doesn't friction damage the stone?
300	00:17:39	00:17:41	Yes, it can.
301	00:17:41	00:17:46	That's why I use synthetic rice paper and light, even strokes.
302	00:17:46	00:17:48	There, okay?
303	00:17:48	00:17:50	All right, you guys go out and do it.
304	00:17:50	00:17:51	Have fun. Okay, thank you.
305	00:17:51	00:17:53	You bet.
306	00:17:53	00:17:55	Donna Hoppe?
307	00:17:55	00:17:56	Yeah?
308	00:17:56	00:17:58	Your secretary told me you would be here.
309	00:17:58	00:18:01	My name is Greg Sanders; I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
310	00:18:01	00:18:03	Sanders? that's Americanized, right?
311	00:18:03	00:18:04	Yeah.
312	00:18:04	00:18:06	Shortened from Sanderson.
313	00:18:06	00:18:10	My father's side was from Harstad, Norway. And your mother's?
314	00:18:10	00:18:11	Hojems.
315	00:18:11	00:18:12	From Oslo.
316	00:18:12	00:18:14	How many were named Olaf?
317	00:18:14	00:18:18	My grandfather was Olaf Hojem the eighth.
318	00:18:18	00:18:21	(laughs) You should hyphenate.
319	00:18:21	00:18:26	Hojem is an infinitely more interesting name than Sanders.
320	00:18:26	00:18:31	But if you wanted a genealogy lesson, you should have shown up earlier, for my seminar.
321	00:18:31	00:18:35	Actually, I'm here on other business.
322	00:18:35	00:18:42	Mrs. Hoppe, I'm very sorry to tell you this, but your business partner, Dan Traxler, was killed last night.
323	00:18:44	00:18:46	Oh, my God.
324	00:18:46	00:18:48	How?
325	00:18:48	00:18:50	What happened?
326	00:18:50	00:18:54	Well, we're investigating it as a homicide.
327	00:18:54	00:18:56	(gasps) Oh, my...
328	00:18:56	00:18:58	Do you know if he had any enemies?
329	00:18:58	00:19:01	Anyone threaten him or your business?
330	00:19:01	00:19:03	No.
331	00:19:03	00:19:05	Dan was a prince.
332	00:19:05	00:19:08	Everybody loved him.
333	00:19:08	00:19:12	Genealogy was his life.
334	00:19:12	00:19:17	If he had any faults, it was that he got too close to his clients.
335	00:19:17	00:19:19	What about his personal life?
336	00:19:19	00:19:22	No, he wasn't seeing anyone.
337	00:19:22	00:19:26	Did he usually carry a briefcase?
338	00:19:26	00:19:28	Yes. It was his second office.
339	00:19:28	00:19:31	What was in it?
340	00:19:31	00:19:33	Um, his work, his research.
341	00:19:33	00:19:35	Did he have a client list?
342	00:19:35	00:19:37	Um...
343	00:19:39	00:19:41	Client names, phone numbers.
344	00:19:41	00:19:43	Oh, great, thanks.
345	00:19:43	00:19:49	Mrs. Hoppe, was it normal for your partner to meet with his clients at night?
346	00:19:49	00:19:52	Yes, we try to accommodate their schedules.
347	00:19:52	00:19:54	If they're working, then we visit them after work.
348	00:19:54	00:19:58	There's a Judy Robbins on this list.
349	00:19:58	00:20:00	Do you know her?
350	00:20:00	00:20:03	No, I think he finished that project.
351	00:20:06	00:20:08	I'm sorry.
352	00:20:08	00:20:10	Will you excuse me, please?
353	00:20:21	00:20:24	Thank you for not asking how I'm doing.
354	00:20:24	00:20:27	David's been asking me every five minutes.
355	00:20:27	00:20:28	Well, he's concerned.
356	00:20:28	00:20:30	As we all are.
357	00:20:30	00:20:32	I know what you're thinking.
358	00:20:35	00:20:37	Well, uh...
359	00:20:37	00:20:41	it's just hard enough when someone you love's in trouble.
360	00:20:41	00:20:44	It's harder still when you're dealing with betrayal.
361	00:20:44	00:20:47	You don't think about that when you have an affair.
362	00:20:47	00:20:49	Judy had an affair before?
363	00:20:49	00:20:51	Not her. Me.
364	00:20:52	00:20:56	Everyone assumes that I can't...
365	00:20:56	00:20:59	a-and I wanted to see if I could.
366	00:21:01	00:21:03	Almost destroyed Judy and our marriage.
367	00:21:03	00:21:08	When I was married to Eddie, he would hurt me, and then...
368	00:21:08	00:21:10	I would hurt him back, and it was just...
369	00:21:10	00:21:12	years of back and forth.
370	00:21:14	00:21:16	That what you think happened here?
371	00:21:17	00:21:19	Cath, I have to take this, I'm sorry.
372	00:21:19	00:21:22	Yeah. Oh, of course.
373	00:21:22	00:21:26	Yeah, thanks for getting back to me so quickly.
374	00:21:26	00:21:28	I got your name from a colleague.
375	00:21:28	00:21:33	My wife needs a criminal defense attorney.
376	00:21:33	00:21:35	It's a murder.
377	00:21:44	00:21:46	Hey, Russell wants an update.
378	00:21:46	00:21:49	You know, for a guy who seems so laid back, Russell can be terrifying.
379	00:21:49	00:21:51	Terrifying? No.
380	00:21:51	00:21:53	I mean, maybe a bit odd or demanding.
381	00:21:53	00:21:58	But, hey, as long as you get the job done as fast as humanly possible-- Does he ever yell out your name?
382	00:21:58	00:22:02	I like to think of it as a respectful shout.
383	00:22:02	00:22:04	Hm. DNA results?
384	00:22:04	00:22:05	There. Help yourself.
385	00:22:08	00:22:13	All right, semen stains on the bed sheets are an admixture of DNA from Doc and Judy.
386	00:22:13	00:22:17	I didn't find semen from Traxler anywhere, but I found his saliva.
387	00:22:19	00:22:21	On a pillow? Likely the murder weapon.
388	00:22:21	00:22:22	Found touch DNA, too.
389	00:22:22	00:22:26	So the killer didn't wear gloves.
390	00:22:26	00:22:28	And the DNA's male, and... not Doc Robbins'.
391	00:22:28	00:22:31	I'm running it through CODIS right now.
392	00:22:31	00:22:33	And our guy's not in CODIS.
393	00:22:33	00:22:36	I'll give you anything if you tell Russell.
394	00:22:38	00:22:40	So, the DNA's a dead end?
395	00:22:40	00:22:42	Um... well, not necessarily.
396	00:22:42	00:22:46	We could expand our search from an individual to a family.
397	00:22:46	00:22:53	If it gets a hit in CODIS, that family could lead us to the killer, like a DNA family tree.
398	00:22:53	00:22:57	If the killer has family in CODIS, we'll get a partial match.
399	00:23:01	00:23:03	Just--just one problem.
400	00:23:03	00:23:06	Uh, can't exactly push a button to do this search.
401	00:23:06	00:23:08	You need the sheriff's approval.
402	00:23:08	00:23:09	Okay, I will...
403	00:23:09	00:23:12	mention that when I talk to the sheriff.
404	00:23:13	00:23:15	Was there something else?
405	00:23:15	00:23:17	No.
406	00:23:17	00:23:18	Okay.
407	00:23:18	00:23:20	I can't believe somebody hurt that nice man.
408	00:23:20	00:23:24	Ms. Smith, you were on Dan Traxler's client list.
409	00:23:24	00:23:26	You hired him? Yes.
410	00:23:26	00:23:28	See, I'm getting married.
411	00:23:28	00:23:31	And my dad's dead; his folks, too.
412	00:23:31	00:23:37	My mom's not close to our family, but I thought if I found her father-- my grandfather-- maybe he could walk me down the aisle.
413	00:23:37	00:23:42	So you wanted Mr. Traxler to find him? Yeah. He said if my grandfather was alive, he could track him down.
414	00:23:42	00:23:44	Did he? I don't know.
415	00:23:44	00:23:46	We were supposed to meet again today.
416	00:23:46	00:23:49	He was excited to show me new documents and records he found.
417	00:23:49	00:23:51	He was like a paper detective.
418	00:23:51	00:23:53	Mr. Traxler ever...
419	00:23:53	00:23:57	behave inappropriately God, no.
420	00:23:57	00:23:59	The guy was a monk.
421	00:23:59	00:24:01	He lived in the past.
422	00:24:01	00:24:03	Feasted on history. His words.
423	00:24:03	00:24:05	Ask his other clients-- they'll tell you the same thing.
424	00:24:05	00:24:07	I spoke with a couple of them before I hired him.
425	00:24:07	00:24:09	Oh, did you speak to Judy Robbins?
426	00:24:09	00:24:12	Yeah. She couldn't say enough nice things about him.
427	00:24:14	00:24:17	I was really counting on having my grandfather at my wedding.
428	00:24:17	00:24:20	What is your grandfather's name?
429	00:24:20	00:24:23	Samuel Francis Duggan.
430	00:24:23	00:24:25	Isn't that a nice name?
431	00:24:31	00:24:33	That's not funny, and I'm busy.
432	00:24:33	00:24:37	So if you have any results for me, cough 'em up.
433	00:24:39	00:24:42	Lipstick on the victim's face was a match to Judy's brand.
434	00:24:42	00:24:44	Well, she said she gave him CPR.
435	00:24:44	00:24:46	I'll bet that's not all she gave him.
436	00:24:46	00:24:51	I'm just saying that when I play Sexual Healing, it's foreplay.
437	00:24:51	00:24:53	Yeah, well, playing it for yourself doesn't count.
438	00:24:53	00:24:55	(wry laugh) What about the cat litter?
439	00:24:55	00:24:57	Not a match to the Robbins' cat.
440	00:24:57	00:24:58	It contained urine with alprazolam.
441	00:24:58	00:25:01	Why would a cat need antidepressants?
442	00:25:01	00:25:06	Antidepressants are commonly prescribed for felines undergoing prolonged medical treatment.
443	00:25:06	00:25:08	And... check this out.
444	00:25:08	00:25:11	One sweep of my radiation isotope identifier...
445	00:25:12	00:25:16	Rings like a Super Jackpot.
446	00:25:16	00:25:20	So the cat urine is radioactive? Iodine 131.
447	00:25:20	00:25:29	It's used to treat thyroid cancer, and it has a half-life of eight days. Now, I'm thinking that the sick cat belonged to the illicit lover. No.
448	00:25:29	00:25:34	No way. I checked Traxler's shoes, office, house-- no kitty litter and no kitty.
449	00:25:34	00:25:37	There's always the unknown accomplice theory.
450	00:25:37	00:25:41	Or Judy's telling the truth and someone else was in that house.
451	00:25:41	00:25:43	Either way, you're looking for a sick cat.
452	00:25:43	00:25:46	Chemotherapy's expensive, done only by veterinary specialists.
453	00:25:46	00:25:51	Okay, so then get me a list of those specialists and every cat they've treated in the last eight days.
454	00:25:51	00:25:53	Get me a warrant.
455	00:25:53	00:25:54	There's a pet-vet privilege.
456	00:25:54	00:25:59	Seriously? No can get you a list of furless felines without it.
457	00:26:02	00:26:07	Henry, what do you got? Ah, the CODIS familial search found our killer's first order relative.
458	00:26:07	00:26:12	A Jimmy Duggan. First order meaning father, brother, son of our killer, right?
459	00:26:12	00:26:13	Here's what I've got.
460	00:26:13	00:26:20	Traxler's client, Carla Duggan Smith, was looking for her grandfather-- Samuel Francis Duggan.
461	00:26:20	00:26:23	Maybe Traxler found Sam, and then Sam found Traxler?
462	00:26:23	00:26:24	So now we need to find Sam.
463	00:26:24	00:26:26	Hey, maybe Jimmy knows where he is.
464	00:26:26	00:26:27	I actually did some extra credit.
465	00:26:27	00:26:29	I could tell you where Jimmy is.
466	00:26:29	00:26:31	Same place he's been the last 13 years.
467	00:26:31	00:26:33	That's almost too easy.
468	00:26:39	00:26:42	Whatever you want, I didn't do it.
469	00:26:43	00:26:51	It says here that you're serving a life sentence for armed robbery That third strike, that--that's a bitch.
470	00:26:51	00:26:53	I'll bet.
471	00:26:53	00:26:58	I want to ask some questions about your family, specifically Samuel Duggan.
472	00:26:58	00:27:02	My old man left when I was 13.
473	00:27:02	00:27:05	He divorced my crazy bitch of a mother.
474	00:27:05	00:27:07	I mean, she was always high on something.
475	00:27:07	00:27:08	Used to beat the crap out of me.
476	00:27:08	00:27:12	That must've been rough. Yeah, well, you won't see me crying.
477	00:27:12	00:27:15	When the old man left, I did, too, you know?
478	00:27:15	00:27:17	On my own at 13.
479	00:27:17	00:27:20	No wonder I ended up in the big house, right?
480	00:27:21	00:27:23	Do you have any brothers, Jimmy?
481	00:27:23	00:27:25	No.
482	00:27:25	00:27:27	I got one sister--Jasmine.
483	00:27:27	00:27:29	She likes to pretend I'm dead.
484	00:27:29	00:27:32	And, of course, the old man, he could have more, I don't know.
485	00:27:32	00:27:35	No, I'm looking for full male relatives, no steps.
486	00:27:35	00:27:38	You have any sons? Nope.
487	00:27:38	00:27:40	What did that bastard do?
488	00:27:40	00:27:42	Maybe nothing, maybe murder.
489	00:27:42	00:27:43	Well, hot damn!
490	00:27:43	00:27:45	We'd be cell mates.
491	00:27:47	00:27:50	Hey, do you think your mom might know where Sam is?
492	00:27:50	00:27:52	Nah, doubt that.
493	00:27:52	00:27:54	If she's sober, you can ask her yourself.
494	00:27:54	00:27:55	She lives in Primm.
495	00:28:02	00:28:07	I searched all our databases-- all I got was Samuel Duggan's date of birth.
496	00:28:07	00:28:11	Oh, archival databases are notoriously incomplete.
497	00:28:11	00:28:14	He could live in another state; he could be dead.
498	00:28:14	00:28:17	But Dan would have discovered that weeks ago and informed his client.
499	00:28:17	00:28:19	So...
500	00:28:19	00:28:24	let's find Jimmy's father Sam by doing the Smith-Duggan family tree.
501	00:28:24	00:28:27	Okay, tell me what you know.
502	00:28:27	00:28:31	All right, uh, my boss talked with Jimmy Duggan.
503	00:28:31	00:28:39	His dad, Sam, married Eunice Carter in 1956 or '57, right out of high school. Mm-hmm.
504	00:28:39	00:28:45	They had Jimmy in 1958 and his sister Jasmine in '67.
505	00:28:45	00:28:53	Now, Jasmine Duggan married Gary Smith in '88, and they had Carla in 1990.
506	00:28:53	00:28:58	Oh, she's the client who wanted to be walked down the aisle by a male relative, right?
507	00:28:58	00:29:02	Right. According to Jimmy, there are no other male relatives.
508	00:29:02	00:29:04	Okay, Hojem-Sanders...
509	00:29:04	00:29:12	the last document signed by Samuel Duggan was the divorce decree-- as far as we know-- in 1971.
510	00:29:12	00:29:14	All we have to do is find it.
511	00:29:17	00:29:19	She's done answering questions.
512	00:29:19	00:29:20	Judy, let's go.
513	00:29:24	00:29:25	Oh... Al.
514	00:29:33	00:29:36	I just want to go home.
515	00:29:36	00:29:41	Listen, Mr. Lewis will drive you home.
516	00:29:41	00:29:43	Al... we need to talk.
517	00:29:43	00:29:45	I want to explain everything.
518	00:29:45	00:29:47	It's just... Judy, Judy...
519	00:29:47	00:29:56	I need to believe in you-- in us-- and if we talk and I'm not convinced...
520	00:29:56	00:29:59	it'll all be gone, and I'm not prepared for that.
521	00:30:03	00:30:05	Okay.
522	00:30:08	00:30:11	Well, when you're ready to talk...
523	00:30:11	00:30:13	I'll be at home.
524	00:30:26	00:30:29	Sit down, Hojem-Sanders.
525	00:30:29	00:30:32	Have I got a story for you.
526	00:30:35	00:30:38	Sam and Eunice's divorce decree.
527	00:30:38	00:30:40	And here's the interesting part.
528	00:30:40	00:30:46	In the state of Nevada, a divorce is normally given six months after the filing.
529	00:30:46	00:30:48	Check the dates.
530	00:30:48	00:30:50	Well, this one took nine months.
531	00:30:50	00:30:51	Why is that?
532	00:30:51	00:30:53	Eunice was pregnant.
533	00:30:53	00:30:56	Judges won't grant a divorce if the woman is with child.
534	00:30:56	00:31:00	They want to wait till after the birth to resolve any custody issues.
535	00:31:00	00:31:03	So Jimmy Duggan could have a sibling that he doesn't even know about.
536	00:31:03	00:31:08	Oh, it gets better-- there is no mention of a baby in this decree.
537	00:31:08	00:31:13	And there's no record of a birth certificate in 1971 for a Duggan.
538	00:31:13	00:31:17	And I even checked under Eunice's maiden name Carter.
539	00:31:17	00:31:18	Nothing.
540	00:31:18	00:31:20	So where does that leave us?
541	00:31:24	00:31:27	A baby was left on the steps of Desert Palm Hospital yesterday.
542	00:31:27	00:31:32	In honor of St. Patrick's Day, the nurses named him Baby Patrick.
543	00:31:32	00:31:36	He will be sent to St. Martine's Orphanage later this week.
544	00:31:36	00:31:38	March 17, 1971.
545	00:31:39	00:31:41	Date fits.
546	00:31:41	00:31:43	It's not very scientific.
547	00:31:43	00:31:46	Well, this isn't science, this is genealogy.
548	00:31:46	00:31:47	Trust your gut.
549	00:31:47	00:31:52	Well, my gut says How do we find St. Patrick?
550	00:31:52	00:31:54	Have faith, my son.
551	00:31:54	00:31:56	Have faith.
552	00:32:02	00:32:04	I'm really digging this genealogy stuff.
553	00:32:04	00:32:13	When Denmark ceded Norway to Sweden, back in 1814, with the Treaty of Kiel, my great-great grandfather, Olaf Hojem, was one of the leaders of the uprising against Swedish rule.
554	00:32:13	00:32:17	He helped convene the first Norwegian assembly and write the national constitution.
555	00:32:17	00:32:19	That sounds great, but tell me about Baby Patrick.
556	00:32:19	00:32:25	Well, St. Martine's Orphanage is long-gone, but Donna was able to track down one of the nuns.
557	00:32:25	00:32:30	According to Sister Mary Agnes, Patrick's legal name is Patrick O'Toole, which was the nun's family name.
558	00:32:30	00:32:33	Apparently, there's a lot of O'Tooles running around Vegas.
559	00:32:33	00:32:35	What do we know about Patrick O'Toole?
560	00:32:35	00:32:36	Uh, he's still local.
561	00:32:36	00:32:39	I checked out his work-- Hodges is at his apartment now.
562	00:32:39	00:32:40	Hey.
563	00:32:40	00:32:42	Wait until I tell you about Eunice Duggan.
564	00:32:42	00:32:48	I always try to remain impartial, but a woman like Eunice Duggan should not be allowed to procreate.
565	00:32:48	00:32:51	That woman didn't stop yelling at me the entire time I was at her house.
566	00:32:51	00:32:55	So Eunice was ex-wife of Samuel and mother of Jimmy.
567	00:32:55	00:33:01	And possibly the birth mother of Patrick O'Toole, who dumped him at Desert Palm Hospital.
568	00:33:01	00:33:03	Eunice gave up DNA, but denies having a kid in 1971.
569	00:33:03	00:33:06	Anyway, Henry's running her swab against the other samples.
570	00:33:06	00:33:12	Okay, so, uh, the landlord would not let me into Patrick O'Toole's apartment, but he did give me one very interesting piece of information.
571	00:33:12	00:33:14	O'Toole has a cat.
572	00:33:14	00:33:15	A sick cat.
573	00:33:15	00:33:19	And there's only one vet in Vegas that does cat thyroid chemo.
574	00:33:21	00:33:22	What--What about my cat?
575	00:33:22	00:33:26	You pretended to be my vet, you told me Barclay needs emergency surgery?
576	00:33:26	00:33:27	That's entrapment or something.
577	00:33:27	00:33:32	If I were you, I'd be more worried about the DNA sample we just sent to the lab.
578	00:33:32	00:33:34	Barclay needs his meds. Well, the vet is right outside.
579	00:33:34	00:33:36	He's gonna make sure Barclay gets what he needs.
580	00:33:36	00:33:40	All right? Now that we got the cat out of the way, let's talk about murder.
581	00:33:40	00:33:41	You ever hear of Dan Traxler?
582	00:33:41	00:33:43	Nope.
583	00:33:43	00:33:45	Let me see the bottom of your shoes.
584	00:33:45	00:33:47	What, you need help?
585	00:33:49	00:33:51	Looks like someone stepped in it.
586	00:33:54	00:33:56	Radioactive cat litter.
587	00:33:56	00:33:59	So, you were in Judy Robbins's house.
588	00:33:59	00:34:01	Who the hell's she?
589	00:34:01	00:34:03	Dan Traxler was visiting her when you killed him.
590	00:34:03	00:34:05	Look, the evidence is going to tell us.
591	00:34:05	00:34:07	I just want to hear it from you.
592	00:34:10	00:34:12	What the hell's wrong with you?
593	00:34:12	00:34:14	I think I screwed up the DNA.
594	00:34:14	00:34:17	Well, if you screw up the DNA, you can kiss your career good-bye.
595	00:34:17	00:34:20	I know! Just... look.
596	00:34:20	00:34:22	Well, the sample runs look fine.
597	00:34:22	00:34:24	Look at the references.
598	00:34:27	00:34:28	Oh.
599	00:34:28	00:34:35	(sighs) I'm not so sure you did anything wrong, but somebody might've.
600	00:34:35	00:34:39	We have to do a kin test to try and make some sense out of this.
601	00:34:39	00:34:41	Well, I'm not gonna do this by myself.
602	00:34:41	00:34:44	Get the reagent.
603	00:35:11	00:35:16	Not a lot of diversity, so, Eunice, Jimmy and Patrick are related.
604	00:35:16	00:35:19	Just not how we thought they were.
605	00:35:19	00:35:21	We need to confirm this with Y-STR.
606	00:35:21	00:35:22	Y-chromosome-linked DNA.
607	00:35:22	00:35:25	That's the only way to be certain.
608	00:35:30	00:35:32	Missing briefcase? Yup.
609	00:35:32	00:35:34	Recovered it from Patrick's car.
610	00:35:34	00:35:36	All right, great. So that proves that he was in Doc's house.
611	00:35:36	00:35:38	What was in it?
612	00:35:38	00:35:42	Documents from a bunch of clients, including Carla Duggan Smith.
613	00:35:42	00:35:47	Traxler kept very detailed records of everything--every meeting, every phone call.
614	00:35:47	00:35:52	And according to his log, he did meet with Patrick several times, including the day he was murdered.
615	00:35:52	00:35:56	Maybe Traxler stumbled across Patrick when he was looking for Carla's grandfather.
616	00:35:56	00:36:00	You know, maybe he thought he'd found another relative for Carla to invite to her wedding.
617	00:36:00	00:36:02	I'm still not sure how this leads to murder.
618	00:36:02	00:36:03	Yeah, me, neither.
619	00:36:03	00:36:04	Greg's working that angle.
620	00:36:04	00:36:06	Oh, good. Greg!
621	00:36:06	00:36:08	Good job.
622	00:36:10	00:36:12	You know we have an intercom system.
623	00:36:12	00:36:13	I got our motive.
624	00:36:13	00:36:15	I know why Patrick killed Traxler.
625	00:36:15	00:36:17	And it's twisted.
626	00:36:17	00:36:18	Cue the banjo music.
627	00:36:18	00:36:26	This report says that your DNA was found on the pillow used to smother Dan Traxler.
628	00:36:26	00:36:28	Without saying one word, that's 25 to life.
629	00:36:28	00:36:34	It also says that the Duggans have one hell of a family secret.
630	00:36:34	00:36:36	Screw you.
631	00:36:36	00:36:40	You were orphaned, abandoned, on your own since you were born.
632	00:36:40	00:36:42	Must have developed a thick skin.
633	00:36:42	00:36:46	Probably tried to forget you even had a family.
634	00:36:46	00:36:48	Hard to miss what you've never had.
635	00:36:48	00:36:55	Until that genealogist showed up asking questions about your family, especially your father.
636	00:36:55	00:36:57	And your curiosity got the best of you.
637	00:36:57	00:37:04	So you followed him, and I'm betting that the old lady, Mama Eunice, wasn't too happy to see you.
638	00:37:04	00:37:06	And she told you who your father was.
639	00:37:06	00:37:09	You are the devil's spawn.
640	00:37:09	00:37:14	I didn't want you then, and I sure as hell don't want you now.
641	00:37:17	00:37:19	My mother had sex with her own son.
642	00:37:19	00:37:21	When Jimmy was 13.
643	00:37:21	00:37:26	Now, that's rape in 50 states, without a statute of limitations.
644	00:37:26	00:37:31	She's going down, and you're the walking, talking proof of her crime.
645	00:37:31	00:37:32	Why take your anger out on Traxler?
646	00:37:32	00:37:37	This guy shows up all excited, talking about family reunions and happy endings.
647	00:37:37	00:37:42	And for the first time in your life, you thought, you're not alone. Yeah.
648	00:37:42	00:37:45	And thanks to him, I know just how screwed up my family is.
649	00:37:45	00:37:47	What were you doing at Judy Robbins's house?
650	00:37:47	00:37:52	After I left that crazy bitch, I went to Traxler's office to get in his face.
651	00:37:52	00:37:55	Saw him leave, so I followed him.
652	00:37:57	00:38:01	Patrick. Get up. Now!
653	00:38:01	00:38:03	Come with me. And the briefcase.
654	00:38:04	00:38:06	You banging this broad?
655	00:38:06	00:38:07	Absolutely not.
656	00:38:07	00:38:08	She's just a client.
657	00:38:08	00:38:09	Take your clothes off.
658	00:38:09	00:38:11	Do it, or I'll kill her.
659	00:38:13	00:38:15	Now get in the bed.
660	00:38:15	00:38:16	Okay, okay...
661	00:38:18	00:38:21	Everybody screws everybody in this world.
662	00:38:21	00:38:24	I knew you cops would think it was a sex thing.
663	00:38:24	00:38:30	My mother's a drunken whore, and my brother's my father.
664	00:38:30	00:38:32	I didn't need to know that.
665	00:38:32	00:38:34	He ruined my life.
666	00:38:34	00:38:40	Well, for what it's worth, I don't think Traxler knew about the incest.
667	00:38:40	00:38:42	I don't care! Rodriguez, wrap him up.
668	00:38:43	00:38:44	That's it?
669	00:39:01	00:39:04	He should've just left it alone.
670	00:39:14	00:39:16	Donna.
671	00:39:16	00:39:17	What brings you here?
672	00:39:17	00:39:19	I found Grandpa Sam in Provo.
673	00:39:19	00:39:21	He goes by Grafs now.
674	00:39:21	00:39:23	And he's agreed to meet Carla.
675	00:39:23	00:39:27	Oh. Well, after all that, I hope he walks her down the aisle.
676	00:39:27	00:39:31	Hojem-Sanders, you are a true romantic.
677	00:39:31	00:39:33	It's very appealing.
678	00:39:36	00:39:38	We arrested the man who killed Dan.
679	00:39:38	00:39:40	I heard.
680	00:39:40	00:39:41	Thank you for that.
681	00:39:41	00:39:44	It's easy to get too close to a client.
682	00:39:44	00:39:47	But Dan always had their interests at heart.
683	00:39:53	00:40:02	In the 1900s, Alrik Magnar Hojem was one of the richest men in Edina, Minnesota.
684	00:40:02	00:40:18	And legend has it, that because of his vast wealth and enormous ego, he earned the nickname cake-eaters, a derogatory term used to describe all Edina residents by their less affluent neighbors.
685	00:40:18	00:40:20	Alrik was my great uncle.
686	00:40:20	00:40:22	His ego was legendary.
687	00:40:22	00:40:25	In fact, that's how my family ended up in California.
688	00:40:25	00:40:27	Ah.
689	00:40:27	00:40:31	If I wanted to learn more about my family history, is it okay to call you?
690	00:40:31	00:40:33	Of course.
691	00:40:33	00:40:35	But let's concentrate on the Hojems.
692	00:40:35	00:40:38	And remember, hyphenate.
693	00:40:47	00:40:49	Hey.
694	00:40:49	00:40:51	I'm glad I caught you.
695	00:40:51	00:40:54	Al, everything Judy said checked out.
696	00:40:54	00:40:58	I just couldn't get past that first impression.
697	00:40:58	00:41:00	Hard for me to get past it, too.
698	00:41:00	00:41:06	Yeah, I guess I was punishing her for what my ex-wife did to me, but that was my marriage, not yours.
699	00:41:06	00:41:08	You were right.
700	00:41:08	00:41:11	My past clouded my judgment.
701	00:41:13	00:41:14	I'm sorry.
702	00:41:14	00:41:16	I appreciate that, Jim.
703	00:41:16	00:41:18	Yeah...
704	00:41:18	00:41:20	Oh, uh... oh, this is... (laughs)
705	00:41:20	00:41:22	This was in Traxler's briefcase.
706	00:41:22	00:41:24	It has your name on it.
707	00:41:24	00:41:26	I'll let Judy tell you what's inside.
708	00:41:27	00:41:29	Go home to your wife, buddy.
709	00:41:51	00:41:52	Hi.
710	00:41:53	00:41:56	Hi. (laughs)
711	00:41:56	00:42:01	I was beginning to think you were going to sleep at the office.
712	00:42:01	00:42:04	I'm sorry for doubting you.
713	00:42:06	00:42:09	And... I'm sorry for...
714	00:42:09	00:42:11	for keeping secrets. I...
715	00:42:13	00:42:15	I wanted it to be a surprise.
716	00:42:18	00:42:20	You did that.
717	00:42:20	00:42:22	Al, I love you.
718	00:42:25	00:42:26	Don't ever doubt that.
719	00:42:26	00:42:28	I won't.
720	00:42:34	00:42:35	Mm!
721	00:42:40	00:42:42	All right, go ahead, open it.
722	00:42:45	00:42:46	Whoa!
723	00:42:46	00:42:48	Yeah.
724	00:42:48	00:42:50	And look at this.
725	00:42:50	00:42:52	Look. I'm related to Buffalo Bill Cody.
726	00:42:52	00:42:54	That is so cool.
