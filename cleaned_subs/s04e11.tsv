0	00:00:05	00:00:07	I saw you with him. I know you're lying.
1	00:00:07	00:00:09	You've got it all wrong. I'm telling you. Nothing happened.
2	00:00:10	00:00:11	Nobody cheats on me.
3	00:00:16	00:00:18	His fingerprints were all over that belt.
4	00:00:18	00:00:20	That's the only way it could have happened.
5	00:00:20	00:00:21	I'm with Lizette, all right?
6	00:00:21	00:00:22	We heard from the DA.
7	00:00:22	00:00:25	They called the cops last week on a domestic disturbance.
8	00:00:25	00:00:26	Kimble was just getting warmed up. Believe me.
9	00:00:27	00:00:28	I know the type.
10	00:00:28	00:00:29	Husband was a casino host.
11	00:00:29	00:00:31	Just happens to come home in the middle of a shift?
12	00:00:31	00:00:32	Come on.
13	00:00:32	00:00:34	Oh, look, we've really talked this thing to death, haven't we?
14	00:00:34	00:00:38	Chris, can we please put this to another vote?
15	00:00:51	00:00:55	The burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt.
16	00:00:55	00:00:56	We don't have that.
17	00:00:56	00:00:57	There was somebody else in the house that day.
18	00:00:57	00:00:59	The cable guy.
19	00:01:02	00:01:04	Cable guy's got priors. He skipped town.
20	00:01:04	00:01:06	You're still on the cable guy theory?
21	00:01:06	00:01:08	His fingerprints weren't even on the belt.
22	00:01:08	00:01:09	He could have worn gloves.
23	00:01:09	00:01:11	I can't take this anymore!
24	00:01:11	00:01:15	Who keeps shutting this damn window?
25	00:01:15	00:01:17	Lunch will be here soon. Let's take a break.
26	00:01:21	00:01:24	This guy is driving me nuts.
27	00:01:24	00:01:26	We've got to get Chris Gibbons replaced.
28	00:01:26	00:01:29	Oh, I pointed him in the right direction, but he didn't snap.
29	00:01:29	00:01:32	I'd kill for a candy bar right now.
30	00:01:32	00:01:35	Hey, people. Your lunch is getting cold.
31	00:01:54	00:01:56	Chris Gibbons, UNLV grad student.
32	00:01:56	00:01:59	The jury's been sequestered two and a half weeks on a murder trial.
33	00:02:00	00:02:06	Twelve strangers... stuck in a room with no exit.
34	00:02:06	00:02:10	hell is other people.
35	00:02:54	00:02:55	What do you got?
36	00:02:56	00:02:57	My early opinion? Blunt force.
37	00:03:03	00:03:07	He's got a, uh, medical alert bracelet.
38	00:03:07	00:03:09	Allergy to penicillin.
39	00:03:09	00:03:14	Well... we got 11 potential suspects.
40	00:03:19	00:03:22	Do you have one with blond hair?
41	00:03:22	00:03:23	Yeah. There's one I know of.
42	00:03:23	00:03:28	Um, Miss Davis-- she's a stripper at The Shimmer.
43	00:03:34	00:03:39	There's no tag cells, and she's not a natural blonde, and it looks synthetic.
44	00:03:39	00:03:41	Hey, this is Vegas, baby.
45	00:03:44	00:03:49	Guilty, guilty... not guilty.
46	00:03:49	00:03:53	11 guilty, one not guilty.
47	00:03:55	00:03:56	Now that's motive.
48	00:04:01	00:04:03	Excuse me. May I have your...?
49	00:04:03	00:04:05	Excuse me.
50	00:04:05	00:04:07	May I have your attention, please?
51	00:04:08	00:04:10	Thank you.
52	00:04:10	00:04:12	I'm Catherine Willows. I'm from the Crime Lab.
53	00:04:12	00:04:14	So it's a mistrial, right?
54	00:04:14	00:04:15	Can we go home?
55	00:04:15	00:04:17	No. I'm sorry.
56	00:04:17	00:04:18	No one is going anywhere.
57	00:04:20	00:04:22	Ms. Davis.
58	00:04:22	00:04:23	I'll start with you.
59	00:04:23	00:04:24	Will you follow me, please?
60	00:04:32	00:04:35	Miss Davis, we found a synthetic blond hair on the victim's body.
61	00:04:35	00:04:37	Care to explain?
62	00:04:37	00:04:38	Girl to girl.
63	00:04:38	00:04:40	I'm a dancer.
64	00:04:40	00:04:43	I came off the pole. I teased him a little bit.
65	00:04:45	00:04:50	I need a release, so why don't you get us out of here, and I'll...
66	00:04:53	00:04:55	Did he take you up on your offer?
67	00:04:55	00:04:58	Well, if you ask me, arguing was his turn-on.
68	00:04:58	00:04:59	Lucky for you.
69	00:04:59	00:05:03	Attempting to influence is a Category D felony.
70	00:05:03	00:05:06	It's up to four years in prison and a $5,000 fine.
71	00:05:06	00:05:08	Am I under arrest?
72	00:05:10	00:05:12	Woman to woman?
73	00:05:13	00:05:15	The pole is there for a reason.
74	00:05:15	00:05:20	It's what you hang on to so the creeps don't pull you out of there.
75	00:05:20	00:05:21	Smarten up.
76	00:05:30	00:05:31	Thanks, man.
77	00:05:31	00:05:32	Stokes.
78	00:05:32	00:05:33	Detective.
79	00:05:33	00:05:34	Hey. Hey.
80	00:05:34	00:05:35	You've got a minute?
81	00:05:36	00:05:36	Yeah. Sure, what's up?
82	00:05:37	00:05:40	Four years ago, you and Grissom worked a missing persons out in Moapa Valley?
83	00:05:40	00:05:43	She lived on a farm with her husband?
84	00:05:43	00:05:46	Wow. Um... Yeah, I remember.
85	00:05:46	00:05:48	Uh-uh, Rita?
86	00:05:48	00:05:49	Rita Westonson.
87	00:05:49	00:05:52	Found nothing suspicious. Nothing criminal.
88	00:05:52	00:05:53	Figured she wanted to skip town, disappear.
89	00:05:53	00:05:55	Rita's sister is in interrogation.
90	00:05:55	00:05:57	She's claiming Rita was murdered.
91	00:05:57	00:06:01	Faye, it's been four years since your sister went missing.
92	00:06:01	00:06:07	Now, CSI conducted a full investigation-- found nothing suspicious, nothing criminal.
93	00:06:07	00:06:09	Why are you coming forward now?
94	00:06:09	00:06:13	I lied to you back then, and I live with the guilt every day.
95	00:06:13	00:06:14	Miss Minden?
96	00:06:14	00:06:17	It's my duty to advise you of your right to counsel.
97	00:06:17	00:06:18	I don't want an attorney.
98	00:06:18	00:06:20	I admit I withheld information.
99	00:06:21	00:06:22	That's why I'm here.
100	00:06:22	00:06:24	And if I have to go to jail, so be it.
101	00:06:24	00:06:26	I just want to do right by my sister.
102	00:06:30	00:06:33	Okay. Let's start from the beginning.
103	00:06:33	00:06:35	Your sister disappeared over a weekend...
104	00:06:35	00:06:37	Rita didn't disappear.
105	00:06:37	00:06:41	Her business trip to Fresno got cut short, and she came home early.
106	00:06:44	00:06:47	Found Aaron, her husband, in the barn with another woman.
107	00:06:47	00:06:53	Rita freaked out and started screaming and saying she was going to leave him.
108	00:06:53	00:06:54	Aaron saw red and lost it.
109	00:06:59	00:07:02	Now if memory serves, her husband had an alibi?
110	00:07:02	00:07:06	Yeah. He was camping in Red Rock with Harris Mathey.
111	00:07:06	00:07:08	That's his business partner, right?
112	00:07:08	00:07:09	Yeah, but Harris owed Aaron a lot of money.
113	00:07:09	00:07:11	He would have said anything.
114	00:07:11	00:07:14	If that's true, Mr. Mathey is guilty of conspiracy after the fact.
115	00:07:14	00:07:18	He died last month.
116	00:07:18	00:07:20	And he's the only one who knew, besides me.
117	00:07:20	00:07:24	Do you know what Aaron did with Rita's body?
118	00:07:38	00:07:45	He drove her out to the river, about a half mile from his farm, and, um, set her on fire.
119	00:07:45	00:07:49	She burned all night, and then in the morning, he dumped her ashes in the water.
120	00:07:54	00:07:55	Miss Minden...
121	00:07:55	00:07:59	how did you come across this information?
122	00:08:07	00:08:09	You were the other woman.
123	00:08:29	00:08:30	Hey, Sara.
124	00:08:30	00:08:33	Any jurors have blood on their hands?
125	00:08:33	00:08:35	Mr. Jervis.
126	00:08:36	00:08:38	Why are your fingers bloodied?
127	00:08:38	00:08:40	You ever been on a jury before?
128	00:08:40	00:08:43	How many grad students does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
129	00:08:43	00:08:45	I can't take this anymore!
130	00:08:48	00:08:51	It's the worst experience of my life.
131	00:08:51	00:08:54	Would you hold your hands up for me, please?
132	00:08:54	00:08:56	The case was a lock anyway.
133	00:08:56	00:08:57	I mean, Kimble obviously had...
134	00:08:57	00:08:58	Mr. Jervis.
135	00:08:58	00:09:01	I need to remind you that you're still under judge's orders not to discuss the case.
136	00:09:01	00:09:05	That's great. This guy's dead, and I still can't go home?
137	00:09:05	00:09:07	Let me tell you something.
138	00:09:07	00:09:13	From the very beginning, day one day after day, this guy is the only holdout.
139	00:09:13	00:09:15	Do you want to know what my boss calls me?
140	00:09:15	00:09:17	Mr. Replaceable.
141	00:09:17	00:09:21	I had to get back to work.
142	00:09:22	00:09:23	I lost my temper.
143	00:09:23	00:09:25	You sure it's lost?
144	00:09:39	00:09:41	Homicide just called.
145	00:09:41	00:09:47	They're reopening the Rita Westonson case based on new information from the eyewitness?
146	00:09:47	00:09:48	File's thinner than I remembered.
147	00:09:48	00:09:50	You think we missed something?
148	00:09:50	00:09:52	We figured she skipped town, wanting to disappear.
149	00:09:52	00:09:55	At the time, that was a reasonable conclusion based on the evidence.
150	00:09:56	00:09:57	Does the witness seem credible to you?
151	00:09:58	00:10:03	Well, if she's lying, she's obstructing justice and wasting my time, but if she's telling the truth, we may have closed the investigation early.
152	00:10:03	00:10:07	At the time, you were a Level Two, I believe.
153	00:10:07	00:10:10	So closing the case would have been my decision.
154	00:10:10	00:10:12	Yeah, it would have.
155	00:10:12	00:10:16	I'm checking out her story. I'll see if it holds up.
156	00:10:16	00:10:17	Let me know.
157	00:10:17	00:10:18	Mm-hmm.
158	00:10:20	00:10:22	Blunt-force trauma didn't kill him.
159	00:10:23	00:10:24	But this might have.
160	00:10:24	00:10:27	Hives?
161	00:10:27	00:10:29	Whoo. Severe allergic reaction.
162	00:10:29	00:10:31	anaphylactic shock.
163	00:10:31	00:10:36	Outer skin becomes irritated, the eyes inflamed, throat closes...
164	00:10:41	00:10:45	He was allergic to penicillin, but that's not the kind of thing you can just easily slip someone.
165	00:10:45	00:10:50	No, but you can inject it.
166	00:10:52	00:10:54	Puncture wound is consistent with a hypodermic needle.
167	00:10:54	00:10:56	He wore a Medic Alert bracelet.
168	00:10:58	00:11:02	Everyone hated him, and everyone knew how to kill him.
169	00:11:10	00:11:13	Haven't been back here since that night.
170	00:11:14	00:11:18	Sometimes it feels like yesterday; sometimes it feels like it never happened.
171	00:11:20	00:11:23	Funny, the things you remember.
172	00:11:36	00:11:39	Who could've imagined?
173	00:11:42	00:11:45	This is it. This is the spot under the tree.
174	00:11:46	00:11:48	You sure?
175	00:11:48	00:11:52	Yes. This is where Aaron burned her body.
176	00:12:04	00:12:05	I remember the...
177	00:12:05	00:12:07	yucca plant was flowering.
178	00:12:12	00:12:13	Right here?
179	00:12:13	00:12:15	Yes.
180	00:12:24	00:12:25	What are you doing?
181	00:12:25	00:12:30	Well, if Rita's body was incinerated here, the gasoline fumes would have settled into the soil...
182	00:12:33	00:12:37	...and trace amounts of hydrocarbon would still be detectable.
183	00:12:37	00:12:39	Good.
184	00:13:35	00:13:36	Mr. Dorsey.
185	00:13:36	00:13:37	I just analyzed your dirt.
186	00:13:38	00:13:41	Where there's smoke, there's fire, and where there's no smoke...
187	00:13:41	00:13:43	There are no hydrocarbons.
188	00:13:43	00:13:44	Damn.
189	00:13:44	00:13:47	There's no evidence of gasoline whatsoever.
190	00:13:47	00:13:49	Where's Hodges?
191	00:13:49	00:13:50	Conference in San Francisco.
192	00:13:51	00:13:52	Total boondoggle.
193	00:13:52	00:13:54	Three days of sourdough and seafood.
194	00:13:55	00:13:57	By the way...
195	00:13:58	00:14:01	...I heard the rumor, and I'm sorry.
196	00:14:01	00:14:02	What rumor?
197	00:14:02	00:14:05	Everybody on the day shift says that you deserved that promotion.
198	00:14:05	00:14:10	You ask me, Grissom only gave Sara a higher evaluation because of their history.
199	00:14:10	00:14:12	He gave Sara...?
200	00:14:12	00:14:14	Hey. You get anything?
201	00:14:14	00:14:18	Well, science seems to have trumped the eyewitness.
202	00:14:18	00:14:19	That story doesn't hold up.
203	00:14:19	00:14:21	I may know why.
204	00:14:21	00:14:23	I ran a background.
205	00:14:23	00:14:28	Faye had two sisters-- Rita, older and Terry, younger.
206	00:14:28	00:14:33	Now get this-- a couple weeks ago Terry and Aaron...
207	00:14:33	00:14:35	got engaged.
208	00:14:36	00:14:38	Hey, Gris.
209	00:14:40	00:14:41	So tox came back on Chris Gibbons.
210	00:14:41	00:14:45	He may have been allergic to penicillin but didn't have any in his system.
211	00:14:45	00:14:48	We sent a sample of his pants to Trace.
212	00:14:48	00:14:50	The area around the injection mark...
213	00:14:50	00:14:52	Epinephrine.
214	00:14:53	00:14:57	So maybe Mr. Gibbons had an allergic reaction to something else.
215	00:14:57	00:14:58	Such as...?
216	00:14:58	00:15:04	I don't know, but if Gibbons knew he was severely allergic, I bet he carried one of those auto-injector pens.
217	00:15:04	00:15:05	So we're looking for a used hypodermic.
218	00:15:06	00:15:06	And another allergy.
219	00:15:07	00:15:08	I'm not the allergy ace.
220	00:15:08	00:15:12	I'm trying to get out in the field, and you're multitasking me in the lab.
221	00:15:12	00:15:15	Rick, I'm the one that actually put you on a case, not just talk about it.
222	00:15:15	00:15:18	You're also the one who took me off the case.
223	00:15:19	00:15:21	You know what?
224	00:15:21	00:15:25	You started, and you gave me six strong innings, and I brought in the closer.
225	00:15:25	00:15:26	What's wrong with that?
226	00:15:27	00:15:29	So what am I, fish or fowl?
227	00:15:29	00:15:31	Fish-- that's a good place to start.
228	00:15:31	00:15:36	I need you to check the victim's blood for shellfish, egg whites, nuts and soy.
229	00:15:36	00:15:37	The biggies.
230	00:15:37	00:15:39	Got to start somewhere.
231	00:16:15	00:16:16	That was Catherine.
232	00:16:16	00:16:17	What are we looking for?
233	00:16:17	00:16:19	Nuts.
234	00:16:19	00:16:21	Specifically those that begin with a P.
235	00:16:57	00:16:59	Take me out to the ball game.
236	00:16:59	00:17:01	Buy me some peanuts.
237	00:17:02	00:17:06	There's peanut skins under Mr. Durham's seat.
238	00:17:15	00:17:17	That's very interesting.
239	00:17:20	00:17:24	There's peanut shells under Mr. Gibbon's seat.
240	00:17:24	00:17:25	Mr. Gibbons couldn't eat peanuts.
241	00:17:25	00:17:26	What are they doing under his seat?
242	00:17:26	00:17:28	Let's ask Mr. Durham.
243	00:17:28	00:17:30	Just 'cause he's allergic doesn't mean I can't have them.
244	00:17:30	00:17:32	Chris Gibbons died from a severe allergic reaction.
245	00:17:32	00:17:35	You were the only guy in the jury room who was eating peanuts.
246	00:17:35	00:17:36	You might have killed him.
247	00:17:36	00:17:38	I was only messing with his head.
248	00:17:40	00:17:43	What are you trying to do, kill me? I'm allergic!
249	00:17:43	00:17:44	You're a hypochondriac.
250	00:17:45	00:17:47	Does that look like hypochondria to you?
251	00:17:47	00:17:52	Look, I didn't know that just by touching a shell it would send him into some kind of fit.
252	00:18:06	00:18:07	I apologized.
253	00:18:08	00:18:11	None of the other jurors mentioned anything about Chris throwing a fit.
254	00:18:11	00:18:12	Hey, look, it wasn't that big of a deal.
255	00:18:13	00:18:16	I mean, we went back to work, deliberated for a couple hours...
256	00:18:16	00:18:18	the guy was fine.
257	00:18:23	00:18:24	You withheld information.
258	00:18:24	00:18:26	No, it's not like that.
259	00:18:26	00:18:27	You don't understand.
260	00:18:27	00:18:29	They why didn't you tell us about your younger sister?
261	00:18:29	00:18:31	Because I knew it would come to this.
262	00:18:31	00:18:35	I was dumped by Aaron for my younger sister.
263	00:18:35	00:18:42	I was hurt and angry and jealous, and I wanted to get back at him, so I falsely accused him of killing Rita.
264	00:18:42	00:18:44	I am not jealous of Terry.
265	00:18:44	00:18:46	I'm scared for her.
266	00:18:48	00:18:50	I don't want her to end up like Rita.
267	00:18:52	00:18:55	Did your relationship with Aaron end amicably?
268	00:18:56	00:18:57	It ended.
269	00:18:57	00:19:00	After the night he killed Rita, I saw him a handful of times.
270	00:19:00	00:19:01	I want nothing to do with him.
271	00:19:01	00:19:03	So why not warn Terry?
272	00:19:03	00:19:04	Tell her what you told us.
273	00:19:04	00:19:05	Because she's in love with him.
274	00:19:05	00:19:09	If I told her what Aaron did to Rita, she'd run right to him.
275	00:19:09	00:19:11	Crazy Faye always causing trouble.
276	00:19:11	00:19:16	Aaron would like nothing more than to drive a wedge between me and my sister.
277	00:19:16	00:19:18	I've seen what he's capable of.
278	00:19:19	00:19:21	That night he made me help him.
279	00:19:23	00:19:26	Her eyes were still opened.
280	00:19:28	00:19:29	It was muddy?
281	00:19:29	00:19:30	Yeah.
282	00:19:30	00:19:32	Okay, was it raining?
283	00:19:32	00:19:33	No, not that night.
284	00:19:33	00:19:36	It was a wet winter.
285	00:19:36	00:19:38	Say you believe me.
286	00:19:47	00:19:50	One auto-injector... used.
287	00:19:50	00:19:55	That's substantiates Bob Durham's story that Gibbons had a reaction to peanut shells.
288	00:19:55	00:19:57	What do you want to bet he only brought one of these with him.
289	00:19:57	00:19:58	Well, he was sequestered.
290	00:19:58	00:20:00	He couldn't exactly go out and get another one.
291	00:20:00	00:20:04	Ah, he was later held defenseless against the attack of the killer peanut.
292	00:20:04	00:20:06	I guess it's possible.
293	00:20:06	00:20:08	We're not finding anything in Chris Gibbon's chili.
294	00:20:08	00:20:11	No peanuts, no shells, no skins.
295	00:20:20	00:20:22	What about peanut butter?
296	00:20:27	00:20:31	In an individually wrapped tube?
297	00:20:31	00:20:33	That could belong to any of the jurors.
298	00:20:42	00:20:44	This looks like peanut butter right here.
299	00:20:44	00:20:47	Someone was doing more than just flicking peanut shells.
300	00:20:50	00:20:55	If Gibbons had that severe a reaction to peanut shells, imagine what eating peanut butter would do to him.
301	00:20:55	00:20:57	Yeah, that's more than just messing with a guy's head.
302	00:20:57	00:20:58	That's murder.
303	00:21:04	00:21:06	Hey, defense motioned for a mistrial.
304	00:21:06	00:21:07	Suspicion of jury tampering.
305	00:21:07	00:21:10	Based on peanut butter in the chili?
306	00:21:10	00:21:13	How does a juror benefit from Gibbons' death?
307	00:21:13	00:21:14	I don't know.
308	00:21:14	00:21:16	Lone hold out, now they get to go home?
309	00:21:16	00:21:17	That's nuts.
310	00:21:17	00:21:19	The risk isn't worth the reward.
311	00:21:19	00:21:21	Well, Warrick's still working on that print.
312	00:21:21	00:21:23	Good. What are you working on?
313	00:22:22	00:22:25	So the soil doesn't support the eye witness testimony.
314	00:22:25	00:22:26	No.
315	00:22:26	00:22:30	So I stuck a moisture testing probe into the ground at the burn site, registered 18%.
316	00:22:30	00:22:34	Now anything over 10% is indicative of full saturation over the last couple of years.
317	00:22:34	00:22:38	The river might have washed away all trace of hydrocarbons.
318	00:22:38	00:22:43	Exactly, but before it washed away, some of the hydrocarbons could have seeped into the ground into the tree's roots.
319	00:22:43	00:22:44	Roots carry nutrients to the tree.
320	00:22:45	00:22:48	Some of the hydrocarbons could have hitched a ride.
321	00:22:48	00:22:52	Oaks don't bear fruit, but this one bears witness.
322	00:22:52	00:22:57	Every year, a branch grows a new ring composed of alike, dark band.
323	00:22:57	00:23:02	Counting from the outside in, going back four years-- one, two, three, four...
324	00:23:02	00:23:06	The ring from four years ago is thinner and distorted.
325	00:23:06	00:23:09	Yeah, the same distortion is present in ring four of every branch.
326	00:23:09	00:23:13	And distortion could mean evidence of a toxic event.
327	00:23:13	00:23:16	I'm thinking the burning of gasoline under the tree.
328	00:23:17	00:23:18	How are you going to prove it?
329	00:23:18	00:23:20	Saw dust.
330	00:23:47	00:23:50	Nick, I think you're going to like this.
331	00:23:52	00:23:54	Affirmative for hydrocarbons.
332	00:23:54	00:23:55	Now we're talking.
333	00:23:55	00:24:00	Nick, no offense, but proving the boss wrong is not the quickest path to career advancement.
334	00:24:00	00:24:03	The trial lasted four weeks.
335	00:24:03	00:24:06	They've been locked in deliberations for two and a half.
336	00:24:06	00:24:07	Sequestered?
337	00:24:07	00:24:08	Well, it's a high-profile case.
338	00:24:08	00:24:13	Judge Slater limited contact, censored newspapers, no television, shuttle between here and their hotel.
339	00:24:13	00:24:15	That's a juror's life.
340	00:24:15	00:24:17	What about the food, how does that work?
341	00:24:17	00:24:20	This case, uh, jurors had breakfast and dinner at the hotel.
342	00:24:21	00:24:23	Lunch, I brought in a menu, they order...
343	00:24:23	00:24:25	Gee, let me guess.
344	00:24:25	00:24:28	For the 17th day in a row, you're going to order chili.
345	00:24:28	00:24:30	Oh, now you're criticizing my food choices.
346	00:24:30	00:24:32	Chris Gibbons had chili the day he died.
347	00:24:32	00:24:33	Yeah, the guy had food allergies.
348	00:24:33	00:24:35	We had one place we ordered from.
349	00:24:35	00:24:37	He had chili every day.
350	00:24:37	00:24:39	Did jurors have access to these vending machines?
351	00:24:39	00:24:41	Uh, yeah, that's why they're here.
352	00:24:41	00:24:42	It's their nickel.
353	00:24:42	00:24:44	I mean, they got to have something.
354	00:24:45	00:24:46	They're away from their families.
355	00:24:46	00:24:48	I have all their cell phone...
356	00:24:48	00:24:50	Well, almost all of them.
357	00:24:50	00:24:53	Caught a guy double packing.
358	00:24:55	00:25:00	Can't anybody make a battery that lasts more than a couple of hours?
359	00:25:02	00:25:07	Hey, I confiscated his primary at the beginning of deliberations, but I don't do cavity searches.
360	00:25:09	00:25:12	How do you burn out your cell phone battery when you're not allowed to use your phone?
361	00:25:13	00:25:15	They don't make cell phones like they used to.
362	00:25:15	00:25:16	That's true, actually.
363	00:25:16	00:25:17	Now they make them better.
364	00:25:17	00:25:19	Did you know that this one takes pictures?
365	00:25:19	00:25:25	And having met your fellow jurors, I think you really captured them.
366	00:25:25	00:25:27	Okay, let's start with the misdemeanor.
367	00:25:27	00:25:32	Cell phones and cameras or cell phones withcameras are prohibited in the jury room.
368	00:25:32	00:25:34	Somebody must have told you that.
369	00:25:34	00:25:35	See, after a while they're family.
370	00:25:35	00:25:41	I-I thought I could throw a scrapbook together for everyone for after the trial.
371	00:25:41	00:25:43	Oh, and-and when where you planning on handing that out?
372	00:25:43	00:25:45	At Mr. Gibbons' funeral?
373	00:25:46	00:25:49	I guess you would consider the folks at the credit company family, too.
374	00:25:49	00:25:51	What?
375	00:25:51	00:25:55	Yeah, according to them, uh, you got a little bit of a gambling jones, hmm?
376	00:25:55	00:25:57	$25,000 in markers all over town.
377	00:25:57	00:26:00	So what's your game, dice, cards, sports book?
378	00:26:00	00:26:01	Or all of the above?
379	00:26:01	00:26:03	Let's just say it was a bad month.
380	00:26:03	00:26:05	Not that bad.
381	00:26:05	00:26:08	$30,000 deposit two days ago.
382	00:26:08	00:26:10	All right, now the questions get hard.
383	00:26:10	00:26:14	I mean, you can't be getting rich on jury duty, 40 bucks a day.
384	00:26:16	00:26:17	Or can you?
385	00:26:18	00:26:24	Look, I'm self-employed, which means I've been unemployed for the last six and a half weeks.
386	00:26:24	00:26:26	You just made $30,000.
387	00:26:26	00:26:27	To deliver the jury?
388	00:26:28	00:26:30	No. My story.
389	00:26:30	00:26:31	To a tabloid.
390	00:26:31	00:26:33	Hey...
391	00:26:33	00:26:37	it's one of those cases-- high-profile, jurors at each other's throats.
392	00:26:43	00:26:46	Why should the guy that killed his wife be the only one to make a buck?
393	00:27:00	00:27:01	Can I help you?
394	00:27:01	00:27:02	I'm Detective Artan.
395	00:27:02	00:27:04	This is Nick Stokes from the Crime Lab.
396	00:27:04	00:27:06	Terry Minden?
397	00:27:06	00:27:07	Honey, who is it?
398	00:27:07	00:27:08	It's the police.
399	00:27:10	00:27:11	I remember you.
400	00:27:11	00:27:13	You were here about Rita. Yeah.
401	00:27:13	00:27:14	You found her.
402	00:27:14	00:27:18	No, no, not exactly, but we have a potential new lead.
403	00:27:18	00:27:20	And we have a warrant.
404	00:27:22	00:27:24	I'm an attorney.
405	00:27:24	00:27:26	You want a sample of gasoline?
406	00:27:26	00:27:30	Uh, yes, ma'am-- eight ounces from Mr. Westonson's pump.
407	00:27:30	00:27:30	Why?
408	00:27:30	00:27:32	This is about Rita.
409	00:27:32	00:27:33	I have a right to know.
410	00:27:33	00:27:35	Warrant was issued by Judge Brenner.
411	00:27:35	00:27:36	I'll make a call.
412	00:27:36	00:27:37	Say hello for me.
413	00:27:39	00:27:41	Four years ago, you tore this place apart.
414	00:27:42	00:27:43	That was okay with me.
415	00:27:43	00:27:46	Now you come back with no answers, and you're looking at me with that same face.
416	00:27:46	00:27:48	I'm going to tell you the same thing I said before.
417	00:27:48	00:27:51	I had nothing to do with Rita's disappearance.
418	00:27:51	00:27:53	Fuel pump's behind the barn, right?
419	00:27:53	00:27:56	Yeah. Help yourself.
420	00:28:06	00:28:07	What are you looking at?
421	00:28:09	00:28:12	I was standing right here four years ago asking myself the same question.
422	00:28:12	00:28:16	You know, Aaron Westonson's right about one thing.
423	00:28:16	00:28:22	Back then Grissom and I processed every inch of that house and this barn and found no signs of a struggle.
424	00:28:22	00:28:24	Aaron versus Rita? He's twice her size.
425	00:28:24	00:28:26	Yeah, it would've been over before it started.
426	00:28:33	00:28:35	Okay, fill her up.
427	00:28:35	00:28:37	I think it's diesel.
428	00:28:37	00:28:38	Why is it red?
429	00:28:38	00:28:40	It's an EPA requirement.
430	00:28:40	00:28:47	Farm's don't have to pay taxes on fuel, so refineries, they mark their agricultural diesel by dying it red.
431	00:29:27	00:29:30	I'm getting married in five days.
432	00:29:30	00:29:34	Not if you can't explain to me how your fingerprints ended up on this peanut butter tube.
433	00:29:36	00:29:40	We found it in the jury room.
434	00:29:43	00:29:46	I just wanted to go home, have my fittings.
435	00:29:46	00:29:49	I spent my bridal shower with 11 strangers.
436	00:29:49	00:29:50	My sister filled in for me.
437	00:29:51	00:29:53	I'll never get to experience that.
438	00:29:53	00:29:57	Mr. Gibbons will never get to experience the rest of his life.
439	00:30:00	00:30:04	We were on a break, and the lunch order came.
440	00:30:04	00:30:05	Hey.
441	00:30:06	00:30:07	What did you order?
442	00:30:07	00:30:10	Don't worry, I'll pass it out.
443	00:30:22	00:30:26	I got the peanut butter out of the vending machine a couple days ago.
444	00:30:26	00:30:31	I wanted to stuff it down the guy's throat, but I didn't.
445	00:30:31	00:30:35	So you decided to put it in his chili instead?
446	00:30:40	00:30:43	Great, food's here.
447	00:30:43	00:30:45	I'm starving. Where's mine?
448	00:30:47	00:30:49	But at the last minute, I couldn't do that.
449	00:30:54	00:30:54	Oh!
450	00:30:56	00:30:58	Oh, I'm so sorry.
451	00:30:58	00:30:59	No, that's okay, I'll take yours.
452	00:30:59	00:31:00	You can reorder.
453	00:31:03	00:31:07	Then I cleaned up and I walked out.
454	00:31:07	00:31:09	You had to know it was going to kill him.
455	00:31:09	00:31:12	No, I didn't know it was going to be lethal.
456	00:31:12	00:31:16	When Bob was flicking peanut shells at him, it's not like he choked up.
457	00:31:18	00:31:20	I swear, I didn't know it was going to kill him.
458	00:31:20	00:31:25	I just thought that it would get him replaced with one of the alternates who would vote guilty.
459	00:31:25	00:31:28	Well, Miss Newsome, you are officially off of jury duty.
460	00:31:30	00:31:32	I killed him.
461	00:31:32	00:31:34	No, she didn't.
462	00:31:34	00:31:37	Greg, she told Warrick she put peanut butter in the chili.
463	00:31:37	00:31:39	I don't care if Mr. Peanut was taking a bath in the vic's lunch.
464	00:31:39	00:31:40	It's not what killed him.
465	00:31:40	00:31:41	Be specific, Greg.
466	00:31:41	00:31:44	I got the detailed results back from the assay test.
467	00:31:44	00:31:48	The level of immunoglobulin E was insufficient to cause a lethal reaction.
468	00:31:51	00:31:54	Well, that does go along with what the bride-to-be said about the victim.
469	00:31:54	00:31:59	That he had a dermatological response to the allergen and not a respiratory one.
470	00:31:59	00:32:02	Did the assay test show any other food allergies?
471	00:32:02	00:32:03	No, uh-uh.
472	00:32:03	00:32:06	So the cause of death is still anaphylactic shock.
473	00:32:06	00:32:08	Okay, what caused it?
474	00:32:08	00:32:10	And who?
475	00:32:24	00:32:26	I got your page.
476	00:32:26	00:32:29	Who shot your dog?
477	00:32:30	00:32:31	Trace tech.
478	00:32:31	00:32:32	He analyzed the fuel from Aaron's pump.
479	00:32:33	00:32:34	Confirmed it's diesel.
480	00:32:34	00:32:38	The hydrocarbons found in the tree were from unleaded gasoline.
481	00:32:38	00:32:43	Means the fuel on Aaron's farm was not used to cremate Rita's body.
482	00:32:43	00:32:44	Maybe it pumped unleaded four years ago.
483	00:32:44	00:32:45	Converted to diesel at some point since.
484	00:32:46	00:32:49	Ah, I thought the same thing myself, so I called the NDEP. Mm-hmm.
485	00:32:50	00:32:56	E Permit for Aaron's fuel tank was specifically for diesel.
486	00:32:56	00:32:57	Where does that leave us?
487	00:32:59	00:33:01	NDEP's database for Clark County.
488	00:33:01	00:33:06	Now, the red dots represent the areas of permitted fuel tanks.
489	00:33:06	00:33:07	Isolate Moapa.
490	00:33:07	00:33:09	Yeah.
491	00:33:12	00:33:17	Aaron's farm's located at the cross streets of White Oak and Stansberry.
492	00:33:19	00:33:23	The burn spot is a half mile east along the river. Mm-hmm.
493	00:33:26	00:33:29	Only two permitted fuel tanks up in that area.
494	00:33:29	00:33:30	The one on the left is Aaron's.
495	00:33:30	00:33:31	We can exclude that one.
496	00:33:31	00:33:33	Who owns the other one?
497	00:33:41	00:33:42	Faye Minden.
498	00:33:44	00:33:47	We've ruled out food allergy as the cause of death.
499	00:33:47	00:33:51	If it was an environmental agent, I expect one of the other jurors had a reaction as well.
500	00:33:51	00:33:55	His body reacted to something.
501	00:33:55	00:34:01	It's why I'm reexamining the exposed areas of his body-- face and the neck.
502	00:34:07	00:34:09	Look at this.
503	00:34:14	00:34:17	Apis Mellifera Linnaeus.
504	00:34:20	00:34:22	We're looking for another body.
505	00:34:32	00:34:35	Greg ran the assay test for bee venom on Chris Gibbons.
506	00:34:35	00:34:37	IG levels were spiked.
507	00:34:37	00:34:39	Was Gibbons even aware that he had a bee allergy?
508	00:34:39	00:34:41	Brass finally tracked down his allergist.
509	00:34:42	00:34:44	Gibbons was allergic to a lot of things.
510	00:34:51	00:34:54	The killer, I presume.
511	00:35:04	00:35:05	Or what's left of him.
512	00:35:17	00:35:21	He had an immediate reaction to a bee sting.
513	00:35:21	00:35:23	Lost consciousness, fell forward, hit his head on the table.
514	00:35:23	00:35:28	You know how Gervis was complaining that it was too hot.
515	00:35:28	00:35:29	He said he opened the window.
516	00:35:29	00:35:32	I can't take this anymore!
517	00:35:32	00:35:35	Who keeps shutting this damn window?!
518	00:35:35	00:35:39	Well, that explains it.
519	00:35:39	00:35:42	It was an outside job.
520	00:35:48	00:35:50	Okay, good. Thank you.
521	00:35:55	00:35:56	Hey. Hey.
522	00:35:56	00:35:59	Heard you were over at Aaron's farm.
523	00:35:59	00:36:01	Yep. I bet that shook him up.
524	00:36:01	00:36:05	Thank you for pushing forward with the investigation.
525	00:36:05	00:36:08	And we continue to push forward.
526	00:36:08	00:36:10	We need to take a sample of fuel from your pump.
527	00:36:10	00:36:13	Yeah. Yeah, you wouldn't mind, would you, Faye?
528	00:36:13	00:36:14	My pump?
529	00:36:14	00:36:15	Yeah.
530	00:36:15	00:36:17	Well, what'd he say?
531	00:36:17	00:36:19	Didn't I tell you he'd turn on me?
532	00:36:19	00:36:21	Oh, he didn't say anything.
533	00:36:21	00:36:23	Just want to take a look.
534	00:36:23	00:36:24	My trees are Douglas firs.
535	00:36:24	00:36:27	The... the needles grow in spirals around the twigs.
536	00:36:27	00:36:28	It's amazing.
537	00:36:28	00:36:31	Any time you guys want, you come back here, take your pick.
538	00:36:31	00:36:33	Free of charge.
539	00:36:33	00:36:36	The pump on Aaron's farm is diesel.
540	00:36:36	00:36:40	Your sister was cremated with unleaded.
541	00:36:44	00:36:46	You know what?
542	00:36:46	00:36:53	Thinking back now, I-I remember Aaron's pump was empty, and, uh, he insisted we drive over here.
543	00:36:53	00:36:55	He used mine.
544	00:36:55	00:36:57	Sorry for the confusion.
545	00:36:58	00:37:00	Excuse me.
546	00:37:00	00:37:03	Please say you believe me.
547	00:38:05	00:38:08	I believe you, Faye.
548	00:38:09	00:38:13	You see, blood evidence doesn't disappear over time.
549	00:38:13	00:38:17	Your sister was murdered...
550	00:38:17	00:38:18	by you.
551	00:38:18	00:38:20	Faye?
552	00:38:20	00:38:21	Faye, you in here?
553	00:38:38	00:38:42	Unleaded gasoline, barrels for incineration, cast off on the walls.
554	00:38:42	00:38:44	DNA consistent with Rita Westonson.
555	00:38:44	00:38:46	Then he killed Rita to be with Aaron.
556	00:38:46	00:38:50	And a couple of weeks ago, hears he's getting engaged to her younger sister Terry.
557	00:38:50	00:38:51	They couldn't handle it, man.
558	00:38:51	00:38:52	She just freaked.
559	00:38:52	00:38:57	So she tried to pin Rita's murder on Aaron.
560	00:38:57	00:39:04	Four years ago when I decided to close the case, did you agree with my decision?
561	00:39:04	00:39:07	Well, you were following protocol.
562	00:39:08	00:39:09	And now?
563	00:39:09	00:39:11	Now I'd fight you on it, yeah.
564	00:39:13	00:39:15	Why?
565	00:39:15	00:39:18	Rita Westonson was a dependable, predictable girl.
566	00:39:18	00:39:22	We never answered the question why she just woke up one morning and walked away from the rest of her life.
567	00:39:22	00:39:23	It happens.
568	00:39:23	00:39:26	And that's what the evidence was telling us.
569	00:39:26	00:39:28	Well, that's what the physical evidence was telling us.
570	00:39:28	00:39:30	We should have dug deeper.
571	00:39:30	00:39:32	You can't just ignore the human element, Grissom.
572	00:39:33	00:39:34	I agree, Nick.
573	00:39:34	00:39:38	But when you start to have feelings for the people involved, you risk your objectivity.
574	00:39:38	00:39:39	So what?
575	00:39:39	00:39:44	You know, I'm always getting criticized for empathizing with the victims and their families, but that's who I am.
576	00:39:44	00:39:48	That's how I do my job.
577	00:39:48	00:39:50	And as far as the promotion goes, it's all good, man.
578	00:39:50	00:39:52	I can live without it.
579	00:39:52	00:39:53	I'm not you.
580	00:40:00	00:40:01	Good.
581	00:40:01	00:40:03	We certainly don't need another me around here.
