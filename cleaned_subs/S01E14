0,00:00:19,00:00:20,"BOY: Come on, Sky."
1,00:00:21,00:00:24,"Sky, come on."
2,00:00:25,00:00:27,"Go get it, Sky!"
3,00:00:27,00:00:29,(barking)
4,00:00:29,00:00:30,"Come on, Sky."
5,00:00:30,00:00:32,"MAN: Bring it back, Sky."
6,00:00:32,00:00:34,"Bring it back, Sky."
7,00:00:34,00:00:36,Good girl.
8,00:00:36,00:00:38,That's not Sky's stick.
9,00:00:38,00:00:40,"What do you have here, Sky?"
10,00:00:40,00:00:42,"Come here, girl."
11,00:00:42,00:00:43,"What'd you get, here?"
12,00:00:43,00:00:45,"What is it, Dad?"
13,00:00:45,00:00:53,"Nothing... it's just... uh, just an old bone probably from a dead animal or something."
14,00:01:08,00:01:13,It's a tibia... or most of a tibia.
15,00:01:13,00:01:15,How long you think it's been out here?
16,00:01:15,00:01:17,"Well, long enough for the animals to pick it clean."
17,00:01:17,00:01:20,And long enough for the elements to have washed away any evidence.
18,00:01:21,00:01:22,Evidence of what?
19,00:01:22,00:01:28,"Well, it is a leg bone and my guess is that it didn't walk out here by itself."
20,00:01:28,00:01:30,"Well, it could have been a hiker who got lost."
21,00:01:30,00:01:34,It's interesting to me how you always expect the worst.
22,00:01:34,00:01:35,"You see, that way, I'm never disappointed."
23,00:01:36,00:01:37,And then sometimes I'm nicely surprised.
24,00:01:37,00:01:39,"So, can we call it a crime scene?"
25,00:01:39,00:01:40,Potential crime scene.
26,00:01:40,00:01:43,Did you know that there's 206 bones in the human body?
27,00:01:44,00:01:47,"Yes, Professor, I, too, took Osteology."
28,00:01:47,00:01:50,"Well, 205 more bones and we have a complete skeleton."
29,00:01:50,00:01:55,"If we find the rest, then we can determine whether or not it was a murder."
30,00:01:55,00:01:59,"Well, I feel it in every one of my 206 bones that this was a murder."
31,00:02:01,00:02:38,"[Captioning sponsored by CBS and CBS PRODUCTIONS/ ALLIANCE ATLANTIS] Okay, Catherine and I are on the case from Mount Charleston."
32,00:02:38,00:02:40,"Nick, we could use your help on that. Outstanding."
33,00:02:40,00:02:41,So I just talked with the academy.
34,00:02:41,00:02:43,We're getting an entire class of cadets meeting us there.
35,00:02:44,00:02:45,All you guys got to go on is a bone? Mm-hmm.
36,00:02:45,00:02:48,GRISSOM: The tibia. Where there's one there's usually another.
37,00:02:48,00:02:52,"So, we'll do a grid search and we really could use your friend, Teri Miller."
38,00:02:52,00:02:53,I don't think that's necessary.
39,00:02:53,00:02:54,"Well, why not?"
40,00:02:54,00:02:58,"She's a forensic anthropologist specializes in bones and, hello..."
41,00:02:58,00:02:59,all we've got is a bone.
42,00:02:59,00:03:02,I know what she specializes in.
43,00:03:02,00:03:04,"If we hit a wall, I'll call her."
44,00:03:04,00:03:06,Okay.
45,00:03:06,00:03:10,"Sara, Warrick-- dead body in the Lucky Seven Motel."
46,00:03:10,00:03:13,Is that the place with that weird pool?
47,00:03:13,00:03:20,"""Maid found dead male body in a hotel room."" Any chance it's old age?"
48,00:03:20,00:03:23,Guy's 23. No.
49,00:03:23,00:03:26,Sounds like a live one.
50,00:03:26,00:03:27,Let's go.
51,00:03:41,00:03:41,Stop!
52,00:03:50,00:03:51,Looks like a piece of skull bone.
53,00:03:59,00:04:00,What are you doing?
54,00:04:00,00:04:02,Bones are porous.
55,00:04:02,00:04:05,They stick to the tongue.
56,00:04:05,00:04:07,This doesn't stick.
57,00:04:07,00:04:09,It's a piece of rock.
58,00:04:09,00:04:11,I-I hope you had your Hepatitis-B shot.
59,00:04:13,00:04:15,Did you?
60,00:04:29,00:04:32,It could be a piece of wrist bone.
61,00:04:32,00:04:34,"Well, do you want to suck it?"
62,00:04:34,00:04:36,To be sure?
63,00:04:36,00:04:39,Flag man!
64,00:04:53,00:04:56,Flag!
65,00:05:06,00:05:07,Flag!
66,00:05:32,00:05:36,So... you thinking what I'm thinking?
67,00:05:36,00:05:39,How amazing the universe is.
68,00:05:39,00:05:42,Everything made from the same carbon.
69,00:05:42,00:05:45,"Stars to trees, trucks to human bones."
70,00:05:45,00:05:47,Mmm... no.
71,00:05:47,00:05:50,I-I was thinking that we have about 100 bone fragments.
72,00:05:50,00:05:52,We could I.D. this body before the end of the shift.
73,00:05:52,00:05:53,Hmm.
74,00:05:55,00:05:57,Stars and trucks?
75,00:06:00,00:06:04,(garbled radio transmission)
76,00:06:16,00:06:18,Only in Vegas.
77,00:06:18,00:06:21,BROWN: Looks like somebody had a par-tay.
78,00:06:21,00:06:22,Here's the wallet.
79,00:06:22,00:06:24,Couple 20s inside.
80,00:06:25,00:06:28,"""Darren Pyne."" Dead at 23."
81,00:06:28,00:06:30,SIDLE: Sign of struggle.
82,00:06:30,00:06:31,I'll dust for prints.
83,00:06:31,00:06:34,BROWN: Looks like he was whacked over the head with this lamp.
84,00:06:34,00:06:35,SIDLE: Yeah.
85,00:06:35,00:06:37,One hit or there'd be blood.
86,00:06:37,00:06:41,BROWN: Unless each hit was to a different part on his dome.
87,00:06:41,00:06:44,Who's the room registered to?
88,00:06:44,00:06:47,"Well, you know, that would be Celine Dion."
89,00:06:47,00:06:55,"But, uh, the bill was charged to the credit card of a Lynn Henry, Eau Claire, Wisconsin."
90,00:06:56,00:06:57,"O'Riley, you think..."
91,00:06:57,00:07:00,Right. Find out the last place she used her credit card.
92,00:07:18,00:07:19,WOMAN: I love those shoes.
93,00:07:19,00:07:20,You can wear them again.
94,00:07:20,00:07:22,And we have to get your veil.
95,00:07:22,00:07:23,Wehave to get your veil.
96,00:07:23,00:07:25,Lynn Henry?
97,00:07:26,00:07:27,You know my name.
98,00:07:27,00:07:29,What's yours?
99,00:07:29,00:07:30,"I'm Warrick Brown, and this is Sara Sidle."
100,00:07:31,00:07:31,Hi.
101,00:07:32,00:07:33,We're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
102,00:07:33,00:07:34,Crime lab?
103,00:07:34,00:07:36,About what?
104,00:07:36,00:07:39,Darren Pyne was found dead in your motel room at the Lucky Seven.
105,00:07:39,00:07:41,Did you know him?
106,00:07:42,00:07:44,"Oh, my God."
107,00:07:44,00:07:45,"Yes, I-I do know him."
108,00:07:46,00:07:47,Sort of.
109,00:07:47,00:07:49,Sort of?
110,00:07:49,00:07:52,"Uh, we, we gave Meg a bachelorette party last night."
111,00:07:52,00:07:54,We hired a male dancer.
112,00:07:54,00:07:58,I didn't want my fiancÃÂ© to know because he's staying at this hotel.
113,00:07:58,00:08:00,So we rented a room in a sort of out-of-the-way place.
114,00:08:00,00:08:02,"So, Darren was the dancer?"
115,00:08:02,00:08:05,"Yeah, h-he arrived around... 10:00?"
116,00:08:06,00:08:07,(all laughing)
117,00:08:09,00:08:11,"Oh, my God!"
118,00:08:12,00:08:13,Whoo!
119,00:08:13,00:08:14,If Steve could see me now.
120,00:08:14,00:08:17,"No husbands tonight, ladies."
121,00:08:17,00:08:18,Or fiancÃÂ©s.
122,00:08:29,00:08:30,"So, we left at 3:00, he was totally fine."
123,00:08:30,00:08:32,"He was danced out, but definitely alive."
124,00:08:35,00:08:36,He didn't leave when you did?
125,00:08:36,00:08:42,"No... uh, he asked if he could stay and the room was already paid for, so I didn't see a problem."
126,00:08:42,00:08:45,"Lynn, how did you get those bruises on your wrists?"
127,00:08:46,00:08:47,"Oh, my God!"
128,00:08:49,00:08:51,I-I don't know.
129,00:08:51,00:08:52,I-I was totally tipsy last night.
130,00:08:52,00:08:55,"I mean, falling all over everything."
131,00:08:55,00:08:56,All right.
132,00:08:56,00:09:00,We'll probably have more questions after the coroner completes his autopsy.
133,00:09:00,00:09:03,If we need to talk to you can we reach you here?
134,00:09:03,00:09:04,Yes.
135,00:09:04,00:09:06,My wedding is tomorrow.
136,00:09:07,00:09:08,Whatever we can do to help.
137,00:09:08,00:09:10,Thanks.
138,00:09:10,00:09:11,Our card.
139,00:09:49,00:09:50,Ankle bone?
140,00:09:51,00:09:52,Medial malleolous?
141,00:09:52,00:09:55,Goes on the bottom of the tibia?
142,00:09:55,00:09:58,That is correct... according to this book.
143,00:09:58,00:10:01,"I'll take toe bones for 200, Alex."
144,00:10:15,00:10:22,"""All the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put Humpty Dumpty back together again."" Hmm."
145,00:10:22,00:10:24,Have we hit a wall yet?
146,00:10:24,00:10:25,No.
147,00:10:25,00:10:28,"This was a man, judging by the pelvic bone."
148,00:10:47,00:10:48,"Hey, Nicky?"
149,00:10:48,00:10:50,Yeah.
150,00:10:50,00:10:53,Let's post this on the Dental Society database-- see if anyone responds.
151,00:11:02,00:11:07,GRISSOM: Five times the length of the humerus means this guy was...
152,00:11:07,00:11:09,six feet tall.
153,00:11:09,00:11:13,"But we don't know his race and we don't know whether he was right- or left-handed, yet."
154,00:11:13,00:11:17,"Well, he was old-- there's some calcification on the rib cartilage."
155,00:11:19,00:11:20,"60, 70 years old, maybe."
156,00:11:20,00:11:22,Hmm.
157,00:11:27,00:11:29,Are the bones whispering to you?
158,00:11:37,00:11:39,Look at these jagged marks on the bone.
159,00:11:42,00:11:44,Wait a minute.
160,00:11:46,00:11:48,This guy was chopped up.
161,00:11:48,00:11:49,That's murder.
162,00:11:50,00:11:52,"Well, not necessarily."
163,00:11:52,00:11:54,Could have happened postmortem.
164,00:11:54,00:11:57,"You know, one of those tractors up in the hills or a mulching machine, maybe."
165,00:11:57,00:11:58,A mulching machine?
166,00:11:58,00:12:01,How long do you plan on ignoring the obvious?
167,00:12:01,00:12:05,A 70-year-old man found in the mountains with clear evidence he was chopped to pieces.
168,00:12:05,00:12:07,That's a... homicide.
169,00:12:07,00:12:10,"WOMAN: Well, you should check for hemorrhagic tissue at the bone's tool marks..."
170,00:12:12,00:12:12,to be certain.
171,00:12:12,00:12:14,Teri.
172,00:12:14,00:12:15,Hi.
173,00:12:15,00:12:16,"Thanks for coming, Teri."
174,00:12:18,00:12:19,I told you I was... calling Teri...
175,00:12:20,00:12:21,...didn't I?
176,00:12:21,00:12:25,"Anyway, what were you saying about hemorrhagic tissue?"
177,00:12:25,00:12:26,It's blood in the soft tissue.
178,00:12:26,00:12:29,"If you find it, it means the guy was alive when he was cut up."
179,00:12:29,00:12:30,Hmm.
180,00:12:30,00:12:33,"Well, maybe you two don't need me, after all."
181,00:12:33,00:12:36,I would never turn away a scientist of your talent.
182,00:12:38,00:12:42,"Uh, could I have a word with you outside, please?"
183,00:12:45,00:12:47,You bring in a specialist without my approval?
184,00:12:48,00:12:52,"And you don't bring in one possibly compromise the case, because you two had a relationship?"
185,00:12:52,00:12:53,Relationship?
186,00:12:53,00:12:54,I hardly know that woman.
187,00:12:54,00:12:59,Oh... so I guess that dopey look in your eye when she's around is just that.
188,00:12:59,00:13:02,Here's the deal-- we're using Cliff Notes to put that skeleton back together in there.
189,00:13:02,00:13:03,Teri is availing her services.
190,00:13:04,00:13:07,"You said she's the best, but hey, if you want me to send her away..."
191,00:13:07,00:13:08,Just...
192,00:13:08,00:13:11,"check with me about stuff like this, will you?"
193,00:13:13,00:13:15,Right.
194,00:13:21,00:13:22,Sorry.
195,00:13:25,00:13:26,"So, how'd we do?"
196,00:13:26,00:13:28,Not bad.
197,00:13:31,00:13:34,Scaphoid... cuneiform.
198,00:13:34,00:13:39,"However, this is a wrist bone and this..."
199,00:13:39,00:13:41,is a foot bone.
200,00:13:46,00:13:48,I'm glad you're here.
201,00:13:57,00:14:01,It looks like someone in the Dental Society database saw your posting.
202,00:14:01,00:14:02,Really?
203,00:14:02,00:14:03,Sid Tucker.
204,00:14:03,00:14:04,No way.
205,00:14:04,00:14:06,A local dentist?
206,00:14:06,00:14:08,He has records that go back 30 years.
207,00:14:08,00:14:10,Move over.
208,00:14:13,00:14:19,"""Hairline fissure of the mandibular canine."" Oh, God, why didn't I learn Latin?"
209,00:14:19,00:14:25,It's lower level third from the middle.
210,00:14:25,00:14:26,Better memory than you.
211,00:14:27,00:14:29,And...
212,00:14:29,00:14:32,our first character match.
213,00:14:33,00:14:37,"""Overlapping left incisors."" That's the front teeth, right?"
214,00:14:37,00:14:38,Two for two.
215,00:14:42,00:14:45,"""Gold fillings."" Well, I know that."
216,00:14:45,00:14:50,He's got gold fillings in adjoining right molars and interspersed in left molars.
217,00:14:50,00:14:53,Tell me this is all we need.
218,00:14:53,00:14:56,Nolan Ryan pitches another perfect game.
219,00:14:56,00:14:58,And the winner is...
220,00:15:00,00:15:01,STOKES: Mel Bennett.
221,00:15:01,00:15:02,326 Franklin Street.
222,00:15:02,00:15:05,"Date of birth September 6, 1931."
223,00:15:05,00:15:08,He was 70.
224,00:15:08,00:15:10,An electric saw? You sure?
225,00:15:10,00:15:13,"Grooves from a handsaw would be straight, parallel."
226,00:15:13,00:15:17,Now look at the grooves along the medial condyle of the femur.
227,00:15:17,00:15:19,They're coarse. See?
228,00:15:20,00:15:23,A reciprocating electric saw was used on this person.
229,00:15:24,00:15:26,"WILLOWS: Excuse me, um, the person's name is Mel Bennett."
230,00:15:26,00:15:27,We just confirmed it.
231,00:15:27,00:15:30,We're going to meet Brass at the widow's house.
232,00:15:30,00:15:31,I got to go. Thank you.
233,00:15:31,00:15:34,"Nick, would you stay here and work with Teri on this soft tissue stuff?"
234,00:15:34,00:15:36,She'll explain it to you.
235,00:15:36,00:15:37,Sure.
236,00:15:37,00:15:38,ROBBINS: Our male dancer.
237,00:15:38,00:15:40,Multiple blows to the head?
238,00:15:40,00:15:41,That's right.
239,00:15:41,00:15:44,And one of those blows did enough damage to cause cranial bleeding.
240,00:15:44,00:15:48,Any of your ladies mention having sex with this victim?
241,00:15:48,00:15:49,No.
242,00:15:49,00:15:51,"Just lap dances, nothing more."
243,00:15:51,00:15:54,I think the dance might have been a bit more intimate.
244,00:15:54,00:15:57,Penile swab's back from the lab.
245,00:15:57,00:15:59,Vaginal cells.
246,00:15:59,00:16:01,Looks like fried eggs.
247,00:16:01,00:16:03,That's because the cells are fresh.
248,00:16:03,00:16:06,Darren had sex just before he died.
249,00:16:06,00:16:09,What's the estimated time of death?
250,00:16:09,00:16:11,Midnight.
251,00:16:11,00:16:12,What?!
252,00:16:12,00:16:15,These ladies said he was alive when they left him at 3:00 a.m.
253,00:16:15,00:16:17,Someone's lying.
254,00:16:20,00:16:23,I don't mean to be snippy but we're already late for my rehearsal dinner.
255,00:16:23,00:16:25,Dinner's going to have to wait.
256,00:16:25,00:16:29,We have forensic proof that Darren Powell had sex with a woman just before he died.
257,00:16:29,00:16:32,And as far as we can tell you were the last three women with him.
258,00:16:32,00:16:34,"So, who's lying?"
259,00:16:48,00:16:51,I have two small children and a husband.
260,00:16:51,00:16:53,I can't be involved in this.
261,00:16:53,00:16:55,(whispering): Joyce... shut up.
262,00:16:56,00:16:57,About what?
263,00:16:58,00:17:03,"Lynn, does this have anything to do with the bruises on your wrists?"
264,00:17:03,00:17:07,"BROWN: Hey, tell us or tell the D.A."
265,00:17:15,00:17:17,Okay.
266,00:17:17,00:17:20,"After the bachelorette party, we left."
267,00:17:20,00:17:25,"I forgot my purse, so I ran back in to get it."
268,00:17:31,00:17:32,Let go of me. Let go!
269,00:17:33,00:17:34,No!
270,00:17:34,00:17:35,Get off!
271,00:17:35,00:17:37,"Oh, no."
272,00:17:37,00:17:41,"I told him no, but he just wouldn't take no for an answer."
273,00:17:41,00:17:42,So he raped you.
274,00:17:43,00:17:44,That's how I got the bruises on my wrists.
275,00:17:45,00:17:49,I didn't even tell them until we got back to the hotel.
276,00:17:49,00:17:50,Was Darren alive when you left?
277,00:17:50,00:17:53,Very... unfortunately.
278,00:17:53,00:17:54,WHEELER: So...
279,00:17:55,00:17:56,can we go now?
280,00:17:56,00:17:59,My fiancee is already asking questions.
281,00:17:59,00:18:01,"Yeah, you can go, but Lynn, uh..."
282,00:18:01,00:18:05,a car's going to take you to the hospital for an exam.
283,00:18:05,00:18:08,An exam for what?
284,00:18:08,00:18:11,It's just standard procedure for sexual assault.
285,00:18:14,00:18:16,(doorbell rings)
286,00:18:18,00:18:22,Yes? I'm Detective Jim Brass-- Las Vegas Police Department.
287,00:18:22,00:18:23,Are you Mrs. Bennett?
288,00:18:24,00:18:25,"Oh, yes."
289,00:18:25,00:18:26,Is this about my car plates?
290,00:18:27,00:18:28,I have them.
291,00:18:28,00:18:30,I just haven't had time to put them on the car.
292,00:18:30,00:18:35,"Actually, Mrs. Bennett we're here about your husband, Mel."
293,00:18:35,00:18:39,"Oh, well, Mel isn't here right now."
294,00:18:39,00:18:41,"Well, do you know where he is?"
295,00:18:41,00:18:43,"Yes, he's at the store."
296,00:18:45,00:18:46,Is there a problem?
297,00:18:46,00:18:48,(garbled radio transmission)
298,00:18:53,00:18:57,"Mrs. Bennett, we're going to ask you a few questions down at the station."
299,00:18:57,00:18:58,But I haven't done anything.
300,00:18:58,00:19:00,(crying)
301,00:19:00,00:19:02,GRISSOM: She looks... distraught.
302,00:19:02,00:19:05,"Well, is that because she just found out he's dead or..."
303,00:19:05,00:19:08,because she got caught?
304,00:19:08,00:19:10,(car door closes)
305,00:19:10,00:19:15,Interesting how people catalog their lives.
306,00:19:15,00:19:16,50 years of marriage on the wall.
307,00:19:18,00:19:21,"BRASS: Yeah, that's a lot of years."
308,00:19:21,00:19:24,Maybe a few too many for the missus.
309,00:19:24,00:19:25,"Oh, I don't know."
310,00:19:25,00:19:29,These two were good with each other.
311,00:19:31,00:19:32,(sighs)
312,00:19:32,00:19:35,It takes a bad marriage to recognize a good one.
313,00:19:46,00:19:50,"Well, not even an aspirin."
314,00:19:54,00:19:55,Look at this.
315,00:19:55,00:19:58,This bathtub hasn't been used lately.
316,00:20:01,00:20:04,"Well, maybe she only uses her other bathroom."
317,00:20:12,00:20:17,Tub's the most obvious place to cut up a body but I don't see anything down there.
318,00:20:17,00:20:18,Try phenolphthalein?
319,00:20:19,00:20:22,Give me a swab.
320,00:20:45,00:20:47,Hmm...
321,00:20:52,00:20:53,How'd you guys do?
322,00:20:53,00:20:55,We found blood in the drain.
323,00:20:55,00:20:57,You find anything?
324,00:20:57,00:20:58,Just the murder weapon.
325,00:21:01,00:21:04,"Cleaned, in the widow's garage."
326,00:21:04,00:21:07,(drill whirs)
327,00:21:11,00:21:13,Bone of a pig.
328,00:21:13,00:21:15,"They are the most like humans, as you know."
329,00:21:22,00:21:24,This saw matches the one Brass found in Mrs. Bennett's garage?
330,00:21:25,00:21:26,Exact model.
331,00:21:28,00:21:29,No doubt about it.
332,00:21:29,00:21:36,The marks on this bone are consistent with the marks on Mel Bennett's bones.
333,00:21:36,00:21:38,"Exact same electric saw, same blade."
334,00:21:38,00:21:41,GRISSOM: Can you tell us anything about the operator?
335,00:21:41,00:21:43,"You mean, Mrs. Bennett?"
336,00:21:44,00:21:45,"Oh, right."
337,00:21:45,00:21:46,(whispering): Reserve judgment.
338,00:21:46,00:21:51,How someone operates a saw is as telling as how someone operates a pen.
339,00:21:51,00:21:52,Now look at the femur.
340,00:21:53,00:21:58,The skipping marks of a saw over the bone tell us whoever used the saw was unfamiliar with its use.
341,00:22:01,00:22:04,"An amateur, if you will."
342,00:22:04,00:22:07,"Someone with a weakened nature, compromised musculature."
343,00:22:18,00:22:23,"What do you mean, ""It doesn't add up?"" SIDLE: Well, we're assuming that a couple of lamp hits to the head killed Darren, right?"
344,00:22:23,00:22:24,"For now, yeah."
345,00:22:25,00:22:26,You read the Coroner's final report.
346,00:22:26,00:22:29,There's no traces of that lamp on his head at points of impact.
347,00:22:29,00:22:32,"Yeah, but maybe the materials didn't adhere."
348,00:22:32,00:22:35,Doesn't mean he wasn't hit in the head with the lamp.
349,00:22:37,00:22:39,What are you looking for?
350,00:22:39,00:22:40,I don't know yet.
351,00:22:40,00:22:42,I'll let you know when I find it.
352,00:22:42,00:22:45,"Well, if you don't know, I can't help you."
353,00:22:49,00:22:50,(sighs)
354,00:22:50,00:22:52,What is this?
355,00:22:54,00:22:56,What? What do you got?
356,00:22:56,00:22:58,Some something.
357,00:22:58,00:22:59,Where?
358,00:22:59,00:23:00,Right there.
359,00:23:00,00:23:02,Good job.
360,00:23:19,00:23:21,SIDLE: Tiniest diamond in the world.
361,00:23:21,00:23:23,"Oh, you think so, huh?"
362,00:23:32,00:23:35,(glass squeaks)
363,00:23:37,00:23:39,No.
364,00:23:39,00:23:41,Diamonds cut glass.
365,00:23:41,00:23:44,This is some cheap-ass cubic zirconia.
366,00:23:44,00:23:46,"The bride-to-be's ring, maybe?"
367,00:23:46,00:23:48,She was here.
368,00:23:48,00:23:50,Let's go ask her.
369,00:23:50,00:23:53,Why do you keep asking me these kinds of questions?
370,00:23:54,00:23:56,"Well, because someone killed your husband, Mrs. Bennett..."
371,00:23:56,00:24:00,and was strong enough to wield an electric saw to do it.
372,00:24:00,00:24:03,But not so strong as to make clean cuts.
373,00:24:03,00:24:05,(sighs)
374,00:24:05,00:24:07,I didn't kill Mel.
375,00:24:07,00:24:09,I loved him.
376,00:24:09,00:24:11,Why didn't you report him missing?
377,00:24:11,00:24:15,"I mean, were you used to him leaving or, did you fight much?"
378,00:24:15,00:24:16,Never.
379,00:24:16,00:24:18,Never.
380,00:24:20,00:24:22,We had a perfect marriage.
381,00:24:22,00:24:25,Perfect.
382,00:24:25,00:24:29,And you failed to report him missing for seven months because...?
383,00:24:29,00:24:31,"I don't like your tone, young man."
384,00:24:33,00:24:36,"Detective, you said I could have an attorney at any time."
385,00:24:36,00:24:38,I think I'd like one now.
386,00:24:38,00:24:39,"Oh, sure, Mrs. Bennett, sure."
387,00:24:42,00:24:43,"Just sign this form, please."
388,00:24:53,00:24:57,SIDLE: Every time we go to find these girls they're somewhere else.
389,00:24:57,00:24:59,You sure you got that address?
390,00:24:59,00:25:01,The desk clerk was talking very quickly.
391,00:25:01,00:25:03,They talk faster at the sports book.
392,00:25:03,00:25:05,What? In the old days.
393,00:25:05,00:25:06,Oh.
394,00:25:06,00:25:08,You think we're dressed for a wedding?
395,00:25:08,00:25:09,"Yeah, not my wedding."
396,00:25:09,00:25:10,(beeper beeping)
397,00:25:11,00:25:12,What?
398,00:25:12,00:25:14,Lynn Henry's SART exam's in.
399,00:25:17,00:25:19,She lied to us.
400,00:25:19,00:25:22,"At this point, I think all those girls are lying to us."
401,00:25:22,00:25:24,"All right, let's call Homicide tell them to meet us there."
402,00:25:25,00:25:28,Let's put this to bed before the honeymoon.
403,00:25:29,00:25:31,(tires screech)
404,00:25:48,00:25:51,"Sorry, Elvis, the wedding party has to leave the building."
405,00:25:55,00:25:56,"(whispers) What? Oh, my God."
406,00:25:56,00:25:58,What's going on?
407,00:25:58,00:26:01,All three of you ladies are coming in for questioning in the murder of Darren Pyne.
408,00:26:01,00:26:02,Murder?
409,00:26:02,00:26:04,Is this a joke?
410,00:26:04,00:26:06,"The clock's going to explain it all, believe me."
411,00:26:06,00:26:08,"LUKE: The, the clock?"
412,00:26:08,00:26:11,"What, what clock?"
413,00:26:13,00:26:14,Hey!
414,00:26:14,00:26:15,Hi.
415,00:26:15,00:26:16,Where you going?
416,00:26:16,00:26:17,I'm leaving.
417,00:26:17,00:26:19,Town?
418,00:26:20,00:26:24,"Don't worry, I was able to isolate some soft tissue from the preserved vertebrae."
419,00:26:24,00:26:27,Nick's working on it now.
420,00:26:27,00:26:29,"Well, I'm going to go check that out."
421,00:26:29,00:26:30,Teri...
422,00:26:30,00:26:31,you rule.
423,00:26:31,00:26:34,"Thanks, Catherine."
424,00:26:34,00:26:36,Well...
425,00:26:36,00:26:39,have a safe trip.
426,00:26:39,00:26:40,Yeah.
427,00:26:42,00:26:46,I-I need to apologize for not returning your call last month.
428,00:26:48,00:26:51,"Teri, I admire your dedication to your work."
429,00:26:51,00:26:55,"Um, dedication to my work didn't keep me from returning your call."
430,00:26:55,00:26:58,Oh.
431,00:26:59,00:27:01,"It, it was nothing."
432,00:27:01,00:27:03,I-I-I just called to see how you were doing.
433,00:27:05,00:27:07,Um... well...
434,00:27:10,00:27:13,Are you still interested in how I'm doing?
435,00:27:15,00:27:17,Of course.
436,00:27:19,00:27:21,So...
437,00:27:21,00:27:24,what's next?
438,00:27:24,00:27:26,Mutilation in the Everglades.
439,00:27:26,00:27:28,Maybe it was just an alligator.
440,00:27:28,00:27:30,Yeah.
441,00:27:30,00:27:32,"And if it's not, I'll be filing for a change of address again."
442,00:27:34,00:27:37,Anyway...
443,00:27:37,00:27:38,I got to go.
444,00:27:39,00:27:43,Do you have to go?
445,00:27:43,00:27:44,I mean...
446,00:27:44,00:27:46,couldn't you take a later flight?
447,00:27:46,00:27:48,More bones?
448,00:27:50,00:27:51,Have dinner with me later.
449,00:27:56,00:27:58,I think the bodies will keep.
450,00:28:01,00:28:03,See the tissue?
451,00:28:03,00:28:05,I do.
452,00:28:05,00:28:06,There's no evidence of blood.
453,00:28:07,00:28:08,Yeah.
454,00:28:08,00:28:11,Tells us blood wasnotpumping through Mel Bennett's veins when he was cut up.
455,00:28:11,00:28:13,Which means he was already dead.
456,00:28:13,00:28:14,Yeah.
457,00:28:14,00:28:16,"So, what does that leave us?"
458,00:28:16,00:28:18,Aspectrumof possibilities.
459,00:28:20,00:28:21,The universe.
460,00:28:21,00:28:25,Leaves me with a Black Widow.
461,00:28:26,00:28:30,We want to thank the crime lab for discovering that Mrs. Bennett's husband was dead when she disassembled him.
462,00:28:30,00:28:32,WILLOWS: Disassembled him?
463,00:28:32,00:28:35,So she admits to taking an electric saw to her husband?
464,00:28:35,00:28:37,"After he was dead, yes."
465,00:28:37,00:28:40,"As you know, in Nevada, there's no law against cutting up a dead body."
466,00:28:40,00:28:42,"There's no law saying it's okay, either."
467,00:28:42,00:28:47,Does your client care to tell ushow her husband came to be dead?
468,00:28:47,00:28:48,"Well, she has no idea."
469,00:28:48,00:28:54,"She came home from the grocer's went into the bathroom and there he was in the tub, deceased."
470,00:28:55,00:28:56,No.
471,00:28:56,00:28:59,I-I want to explain.
472,00:29:01,00:29:03,"Briefly, Mrs. Bennett."
473,00:29:04,00:29:07,(sighs)
474,00:29:07,00:29:09,I couldn't afford the burial.
475,00:29:09,00:29:12,So I-I got the saw...
476,00:29:12,00:29:16,and I cut him into manageable pieces.
477,00:29:17,00:29:19,Manageable?
478,00:29:19,00:29:21,Mmm.
479,00:29:23,00:29:27,You made it easier to transport his body?
480,00:29:27,00:29:29,Yeah.
481,00:29:29,00:29:31,To Mount Charleston.
482,00:29:33,00:29:35,(door opens)
483,00:29:35,00:29:38,I called that whistle-blower's line at the local Treasury office.
484,00:29:38,00:29:40,"You know, the one that handles social security fraud?"
485,00:29:40,00:29:42,They were happy to help.
486,00:29:47,00:29:49,"Well, Mrs. Bennett..."
487,00:29:49,00:29:52,can you afford the burial now?
488,00:29:55,00:29:56,What are you talking about?
489,00:29:56,00:30:00,It's her husband's social security checks from the last two years.
490,00:30:00,00:30:03,BRASS: The signature's the same till seven months ago.
491,00:30:03,00:30:04,Q.D. matched the lady's writing.
492,00:30:04,00:30:09,"Mrs. Bennett, you've been cashing your dearly departed's checks, haven't you?"
493,00:30:10,00:30:12,And that's fraud.
494,00:30:15,00:30:17,It's also a motive.
495,00:30:17,00:30:21,"FINN: If you want to alert the Government about some forged social security checks, be my guest."
496,00:30:21,00:30:23,But there's no murder here.
497,00:30:25,00:30:27,We're done.
498,00:30:27,00:30:29,Excuse me.
499,00:30:43,00:30:50,WILLOWS: Typical Vegas wife-- offs her old man for the money and there's nothing we can do about it.
500,00:30:50,00:30:51,We have to go back to the body.
501,00:30:51,00:30:52,Right.
502,00:30:53,00:30:56,There's always a clue except we don't have a body.
503,00:30:56,00:30:59,We have bones.
504,00:31:11,00:31:13,I'll take it to Greg.
505,00:31:13,00:31:16,Skeletal muscle of Mel Bennett.
506,00:31:16,00:31:17,It goes in...
507,00:31:24,00:31:25,Contents come out.
508,00:31:25,00:31:29,In 30 seconds-- Bioassay.
509,00:31:29,00:31:30,I like saying that word.
510,00:31:30,00:31:32,Bioassay.
511,00:31:32,00:31:33,Sounds Nubian.
512,00:31:33,00:31:34,So how are you?
513,00:31:34,00:31:36,Never better.
514,00:31:36,00:31:38,"Yeah? Well, you look good."
515,00:31:38,00:31:39,I try.
516,00:31:39,00:31:41,Yeah. I heard Grissom's lady friend was in town.
517,00:31:41,00:31:43,Lady friend? Hmm. Wouldn't know anything about that.
518,00:31:43,00:31:45,Really? I thought you and Grissom were tight.
519,00:31:45,00:31:47,We are. (machine noise)
520,00:31:47,00:31:49,Okay. Got it. Private.
521,00:31:54,00:31:56,Huh. Digoxin.
522,00:31:56,00:31:58,Digoxin?
523,00:31:58,00:32:03,It's supposed to treat heart failure but not if you're taking the amount found in Mel Bennett's bones.
524,00:32:03,00:32:05,She poisoned him.
525,00:32:07,00:32:09,Someone did.
526,00:32:15,00:32:17,We know your husband had an overdose in his system.
527,00:32:19,00:32:22,We found it in his bone tissue.
528,00:32:22,00:32:26,WILLOWS: Did you kill him for his pension checks?
529,00:32:26,00:32:27,Don't answer that question.
530,00:32:27,00:32:28,It's okay.
531,00:32:28,00:32:31,Mel took those pills himself.
532,00:32:32,00:32:36,He asked me to leave the house so he could do it.
533,00:32:36,00:32:37,"So, now it's suicide."
534,00:32:38,00:32:41,He was dying from the heart trouble.
535,00:32:41,00:32:43,He was in chronic pain.
536,00:32:43,00:32:45,He asked me to get it over with.
537,00:32:45,00:32:47,I couldn't.
538,00:32:47,00:32:50,I loved him.
539,00:32:52,00:32:54,This is the part that I'm having a hard time with.
540,00:32:54,00:33:00,You were able to cut him up when you realized you couldn't afford the burial.
541,00:33:00,00:33:04,I lied aboutwhy.
542,00:33:04,00:33:05,"Mrs. Bennett, don't... No."
543,00:33:06,00:33:07,Let me talk.
544,00:33:07,00:33:15,Mel made me promise to hide his body so I wouldn't lose his social security benefits.
545,00:33:15,00:33:20,Because a wife's benefits are cut in half when the husband dies.
546,00:33:20,00:33:21,Yes.
547,00:33:21,00:33:30,Even if you've spent 50 years by his side-- packing his lunch pressing his work pants.
548,00:33:30,00:33:34,Mel was my whole life.
549,00:33:34,00:33:37,I didn't kill him.
550,00:33:37,00:33:42,I couldn't even put him out of his misery.
551,00:33:49,00:33:52,"So what do you think, Jim?"
552,00:33:52,00:33:53,I don't know. You're the lab guys.
553,00:33:53,00:33:54,What is the evidence telling you?
554,00:33:55,00:34:00,"Forensically, we can't prove if Mel took the digoxin overdose or if she forced it on him."
555,00:34:00,00:34:02,So that leaves us with one choice.
556,00:34:02,00:34:05,Equivocal evidence.
557,00:34:05,00:34:06,Golden rule.
558,00:34:06,00:34:08,Ah.
559,00:34:08,00:34:14,"Well, ""When faced with evidence ""that can equally exonerate or implicate a suspect, we must ""as objective interpreters of that evidence..."
560,00:34:14,00:34:18,"side with the defendant."" Tie goes to the brother."
561,00:34:18,00:34:20,Rose goes free.
562,00:34:20,00:34:22,We'll never prove who administered the fatal dose.
563,00:34:23,00:34:26,I don't think she did it.
564,00:34:26,00:34:28,"Okay, then."
565,00:34:28,00:34:29,I guess I'm out of here.
566,00:34:29,00:34:31,I'll go start my paperwork.
567,00:34:31,00:34:34,See you.
568,00:34:34,00:34:36,"Okay, so, I was wrong."
569,00:34:36,00:34:37,It wasn't murder.
570,00:34:37,00:34:39,It's not a contest.
571,00:34:39,00:34:41,You want to go in with me?
572,00:34:41,00:34:43,Give her the good news?
573,00:34:43,00:34:44,Could you do it?
574,00:34:44,00:34:47,I'm sort of late for a dinner.
575,00:34:47,00:34:49,Sure.
576,00:34:49,00:34:52,Thanks.
577,00:35:06,00:35:12,"So, ladies of the wedding party, you get a free course in the forensics of sexual intercourse."
578,00:35:12,00:35:13,Secrets of our trade.
579,00:35:13,00:35:19,"Lynn, when you had your exam for sexual assault a SART nurse makes a chart like this."
580,00:35:23,00:35:25,This is the vagina.
581,00:35:27,00:35:29,And itdoestell a monologue.
582,00:35:29,00:35:33,Some bruising is normal when sex occurs.
583,00:35:33,00:35:35,Injuries at 11...
584,00:35:35,00:35:43,"12, or 1:00, indicate consensual sex or what we would call ""avid."" Injuries around the dinner hour..."
585,00:35:43,00:35:48,"Five, six, or seven, indicate forced entry."
586,00:35:48,00:35:52,The woman hasn't done anything to help her partner thus sustaining serious bruising.
587,00:35:52,00:35:56,"Sidle, I'm going to be just outside the door."
588,00:35:56,00:35:58,"Okay, O'Riley."
589,00:36:00,00:36:02,Lynn...
590,00:36:02,00:36:07,Your exam showed no evidence of sex in the last 48 hours.
591,00:36:07,00:36:08,"Actually, in months."
592,00:36:10,00:36:12,(snickers)
593,00:36:12,00:36:16,But the epithelials indicate that Darren had sex right before he died.
594,00:36:16,00:36:21,And the coroner puts time of death when you've all admitted to being present.
595,00:36:21,00:36:23,So...
596,00:36:23,00:36:25,Meg?
597,00:36:26,00:36:28,Joyce?
598,00:36:32,00:36:35,"Look, we can run the clock exam on each of you."
599,00:36:35,00:36:38,And the clock is going to tell us what happened.
600,00:36:40,00:36:42,So who wants to go first?
601,00:36:45,00:36:49,I had sex with Darren.
602,00:36:51,00:36:54,And it wasn't rape.
603,00:36:54,00:37:05,MEG: Darren had been flirting with me all night and when it was time to leave I told the other girls to wait in the car.
604,00:37:05,00:37:10,I know it's crazy but I thought...
605,00:37:10,00:37:12,I'm in Vegas.
606,00:37:12,00:37:14,It doesn't really count.
607,00:37:25,00:37:26,And...
608,00:37:26,00:37:30,Then I don't know what happened.
609,00:37:30,00:37:33,I saw my engagement ring.
610,00:37:33,00:37:41,Then I-I thought about Luke and how he trusts me.
611,00:37:41,00:37:43,I don't think this is right.
612,00:37:43,00:37:44,"Oh, you like it a little rough."
613,00:37:44,00:37:46,I tried to push Darren of me... Okay.
614,00:37:46,00:37:48,We can do that.
615,00:37:48,00:37:50,But I-I don't think it got through.
616,00:37:50,00:37:53,He wouldn't stop.
617,00:37:55,00:37:58,"As soon as I hit him with the lamp, I knew."
618,00:37:58,00:38:01,WARRICK: So you only hit him once?
619,00:38:01,00:38:04,Mm-hmm.
620,00:38:08,00:38:12,I didn't mean to kill him.
621,00:38:12,00:38:15,"Meg, your engagement ring..."
622,00:38:15,00:38:18,Is that a cubic zirconia?
623,00:38:18,00:38:21,"No, it's a real diamond."
624,00:38:21,00:38:25,My fiancÃÂ© wanted me to have the best.
625,00:38:27,00:38:29,Does your fiancÃÂ© have a zirconia ring?
626,00:38:29,00:38:32,Zirconia studded.
627,00:38:34,00:38:36,It's a promise ring.
628,00:38:36,00:38:41,He told me to save my money...
629,00:38:41,00:38:43,for our honeymoon.
630,00:38:47,00:38:48,Damaged?
631,00:38:48,00:38:50,"No, my ring is fine."
632,00:38:50,00:38:51,May we see it?
633,00:39:03,00:39:05,"You were in that motel room that night, weren't you, Luke?"
634,00:39:05,00:39:07,I don't know what you're talking about.
635,00:39:07,00:39:09,What happened? You got wind of the party?
636,00:39:10,00:39:12,(groans): I don't know where she is.
637,00:39:12,00:39:13,Let her go!
638,00:39:13,00:39:14,Your husband told me you were here.
639,00:39:14,00:39:15,Now tell me where she is.
640,00:39:15,00:39:16,Let go of me.
641,00:39:17,00:39:18,Just give me the room number.
642,00:39:18,00:39:19,Tell me where she is.
643,00:39:19,00:39:22,Bruised up Lynn's wrists.
644,00:39:24,00:39:27,"Meg, you did have sex with Darren the dancer."
645,00:39:27,00:39:30,Maybe you even tried to stop in the middle of it.
646,00:39:30,00:39:32,But something got your attention.
647,00:39:32,00:39:36,I don't think this is right.
648,00:39:36,00:39:38,"MEG: Oh, my God!"
649,00:39:38,00:39:39,Luke.
650,00:39:39,00:39:42,(glass breaking)
651,00:39:42,00:39:46,"Luke, you threw the lamp-- probably on the floor."
652,00:39:46,00:39:48,Understandable rage.
653,00:39:49,00:39:52,You did what any guy in your position would do.
654,00:39:52,00:39:53,(screaming)
655,00:39:53,00:39:56,But you didn't stop with one hit.
656,00:40:01,00:40:05,And you didn't know that you had lost a piece of your ring.
657,00:40:07,00:40:08,Except we found it.
658,00:40:16,00:40:19,"Honey, I'm sorry."
659,00:40:26,00:40:27,We just...
660,00:40:27,00:40:30,We just were hoping we could get married.
661,00:40:30,00:40:33,Put it all behind us.
662,00:40:39,00:40:43,Laws don't end when you come to Vegas.
663,00:41:02,00:41:04,(laughing)
664,00:41:05,00:41:08,I'm surprised.
665,00:41:08,00:41:10,I'm having a nice time.
666,00:41:10,00:41:12,Were you expecting a bad time?
667,00:41:12,00:41:18,No. I just thought we might be uncomfortable away from work.
668,00:41:18,00:41:21,Are you?
669,00:41:23,00:41:25,No.
670,00:41:26,00:41:28,Nor am I.
671,00:41:28,00:41:29,Good.
672,00:41:29,00:41:31,It's kind of like that old saying.
673,00:41:31,00:41:32,"""How a person does one thing is..."
674,00:41:32,00:41:35,"...how a person does everything."" Exactly."
675,00:41:38,00:41:41,(beeping)
676,00:41:41,00:41:43,Excuse me. Sure.
677,00:41:52,00:41:54,What's going on?
678,00:41:54,00:41:56,(sighs)
679,00:41:56,00:42:00,They found two bodies in a crack den at the end of the strip.
680,00:42:00,00:42:03,"Evidently, they've been dead a while."
681,00:42:03,00:42:07,They need me to do an insect analysis ASAP.
682,00:42:07,00:42:09,Oh.
683,00:42:11,00:42:13,Well...
684,00:42:13,00:42:15,you are the bug guy.
685,00:42:15,00:42:18,Yeah.
686,00:42:20,00:42:23,But I asked you to postpone your flight.
687,00:42:23,00:42:26,It's okay.
688,00:42:26,00:42:28,It happens.
689,00:42:30,00:42:32,Maybe I can...
690,00:42:32,00:42:34,(phone ringing)
691,00:42:37,00:42:39,I'm sorry.
692,00:42:43,00:42:44,Yeah. Grissom.
693,00:42:44,00:42:47,"All right, look..."
694,00:42:47,00:42:55,make sure the paramedics don't leave and have the primary on the scene take photographs of the corpses at two minute intervals until I arrive.
695,00:42:55,00:42:57,All right?
