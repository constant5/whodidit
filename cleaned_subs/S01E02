0	00:00:01	00:00:04	Welcome to Forensics. Gil Grissom.
1	00:00:04	00:00:05	I’m your supervisor on graveyard.
2	00:00:05	00:00:07	Holly Gribbs.
3	00:00:07	00:00:09	You’re the fifth person I’ve been forced to hire.
4	00:00:09	00:00:11	Well, that’s not fair.
5	00:00:11	00:00:14	You think putting a juiced-in lieutenant’s daughter on the shift is fair?
6	00:00:14	00:00:16	I’m fulfilling her dreams, not mine.
7	00:00:16	00:00:26	I can sit here, and I can baby you and I can tell you to quit, but I’m not going to do that at least until you’ve solved your first, and if, after that, you don’t feel like King Kong on cocaine...
8	00:00:26	00:00:27	then you can quit.
9	00:00:27	00:00:32	Grissom, have Warrick shadow Gribbs for the next three weeks or until Nicky makes his 100th, whatever comes first.
10	00:00:32	00:00:34	People walk every day because of you. Every day!
11	00:00:34	00:00:36	That’s enough. That’s enough. Warrick, let’s go!
12	00:00:36	00:00:40	You had him, and the minute you started thinking about yourself instead of the case, you lost him.
13	00:00:40	00:00:41	You’ll be okay on your own?
14	00:00:41	00:00:42	Are you kidding?
15	00:00:42	00:00:43	I’m fired up, ready to go.
16	00:00:43	00:00:45	Besides, there’s an officer here.
17	00:00:45	00:00:46	I’m sorry, Judge.
18	00:00:46	00:00:48	Captain Brass wouldn’t call you for a search warrant.
19	00:00:48	00:00:50	I got a whopper on the line with a 100-pound test.
20	00:00:50	00:00:52	You got a winner for me?
21	00:00:52	00:00:53	Favre.
22	00:00:53	00:00:57	You put $5,000 down on the Pack for me I’ll give you a blank warrant.
23	00:00:57	00:00:59	Congratulations, Nicky, my boy.
24	00:00:59	00:01:00	You are now a C.S.I. Level Three.
25	00:01:00	00:01:01	Whoo!
26	00:01:01	00:01:03	Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
27	00:01:03	00:01:05	I’ll be right there.
28	00:01:05	00:01:07	Uh, give me ’Niners for five dimes.
29	00:01:08	00:01:10	Weren’t you supposed to be shadowing Holly?
30	00:01:10	00:01:12	Oh. She’s cool.
31	00:01:12	00:01:13	She’s doing prints on that 4-0-7.
32	00:01:13	00:01:14	There’s an officer there.
33	00:01:14	00:01:15	Excuse me, miss.
34	00:01:16	00:01:18	Holly Gribbs has been shot.
35	00:01:18	00:01:21	They don’t think she’s going to make it.
36	00:02:01	00:02:03	Oh!
37	00:02:15	00:02:16	Hey, look.
38	00:02:23	00:02:25	Oh, $40 million.
39	00:02:25	00:02:27	Could you imagine?
40	00:02:27	00:02:29	Never happen.
41	00:02:29	00:02:31	You got a better chance of going to the moon.
42	00:02:31	00:02:34	Oh, give me a $20. Hurry!
43	00:02:34	00:02:35	I just got a premonition.
44	00:02:35	00:02:37	You got your own money. Go play.
45	00:02:37	00:02:39	But I left my purse in the room.
46	00:02:39	00:02:42	I’ll play. Wait here.
47	00:02:48	00:02:49	Is this your slot card?
48	00:02:49	00:02:51	No.
49	00:02:58	00:03:01	Your little premonition just cost me $20.
50	00:03:01	00:03:02	Happy now?
51	00:03:02	00:03:04	Here.
52	00:03:06	00:03:08	Watch out.
53	00:03:08	00:03:09	Here come the millions.
54	00:03:10	00:03:11	Oh, my God!
55	00:03:27	00:03:28	$40 million.
56	00:03:28	00:03:32	You’ll be having lobster tonight.
57	00:03:32	00:03:34	They gave us the Presidential Suite.
58	00:03:34	00:03:36	Can you believe it?
59	00:03:36	00:03:39	Here, Richard Gere, why don’t you let me help you with that?
60	00:03:44	00:03:45	Thank you.
61	00:03:47	00:03:49	Oh! Look at our view!
62	00:03:52	00:03:53	Wow!
63	00:03:56	00:03:59	Take a hike.
64	00:03:59	00:04:00	Get lost.
65	00:04:00	00:04:02	Excuse me?
66	00:04:02	00:04:03	Come on, Jamie.
67	00:04:03	00:04:05	I’m a millionaire now.
68	00:04:05	00:04:08	Now, why would I want to waste any more time with you?
69	00:04:09	00:04:11	Room service.
70	00:04:12	00:04:18	All right, the minute you hear anything on Holly Gribbs’s condition I want you to page me.
71	00:04:18	00:04:20	All right? Bye.
72	00:04:20	00:04:23	...call back at 4-7-7 Desert Inn Road.
73	00:04:23	00:04:25	So he pulled a Louganis, huh?
74	00:04:25	00:04:26	Yeah, 150 feet.
75	00:04:26	00:04:28	The Gigamillions curse strikes again.
76	00:04:28	00:04:31	Past four winners ended up dead or missing.
77	00:04:31	00:04:32	What do you think, Grissom?
78	00:04:32	00:04:33	It’s a conspiracy.
79	00:04:33	00:04:34	Coincidence.
80	00:04:34	00:04:35	I worked those four cases.
81	00:04:35	00:04:37	There was never any evidence of foul play.
82	00:04:37	00:04:39	Was he in town with anybody?
83	00:04:39	00:04:40	His girlfriend.
84	00:04:40	00:04:41	She’s upstairs in police custody.
85	00:04:41	00:04:43	Do you want to talk to her?
86	00:04:43	00:04:44	Not yet.
87	00:04:44	00:04:45	Right now, I want to talk to him.
88	00:04:45	00:04:48	How do you talk to a dead body?
89	00:04:48	00:04:51	I let him talk to me, actually.
90	00:04:51	00:04:53	In fact, he just spoke.
91	00:04:53	00:04:55	Didn’t you hear him?
92	00:04:55	00:04:59	He just told me that he didn’t commit suicide.
93	00:04:59	00:05:01	No. You-you lost me.
94	00:05:01	00:05:03	This guy fell to his death wearing prescription eyeglasses.
95	00:05:03	00:05:06	Jumpers take their glasses off.
96	00:05:08	00:05:10	Suicide is the ultimate form of selfishness, detective.
97	00:05:10	00:05:17	It’s unlikely that anyone cowardly enough to take his own life would be brave enough to watch his own death.
98	00:05:17	00:05:21	You can tell all that just by looking at a pair of eyeglasses?
99	00:05:21	00:05:23	You have no idea.
100	00:05:59	00:06:00	Messages?
101	00:06:00	00:06:01	Mm-hmm.
102	00:06:32	00:06:34	I just got off the phone with the Sheriff.
103	00:06:34	00:06:37	He says he wants me to run the unit.
104	00:06:37	00:06:39	You’re the boss.
105	00:06:41	00:06:43	I mean, I can’t say I didn’t do it to myself.
106	00:06:43	00:06:45	Where are they going to place you?
107	00:06:45	00:06:47	Homicide. Believe that?
108	00:06:48	00:06:52	Instead of moving up, I’m moving back in a time capsule, like it’s 1979 again.
109	00:06:55	00:06:57	So, I guess, this might put you and me at odds.
110	00:06:57	00:06:59	Cop versus scientist.
111	00:06:59	00:07:01	Interesting, huh?
112	00:07:04	00:07:05	Yeah.
113	00:07:07	00:07:09	You got any advice for me?
114	00:07:09	00:07:12	Yeah, cover you ass...
115	00:07:12	00:07:13	and hide.
116	00:07:15	00:07:17	They’re all yours, pal.
117	00:07:19	00:07:25	Tragedy struck early this morning when an on-duty Las Vegas criminalist was brutally gunned down.
118	00:07:25	00:07:27	It was her first night on the job.
119	00:07:27	00:07:34	Victim Holly Gribbs was investigating a robbery/homicide in an apartment on the corner of M.L.K. and Warm Springs.
120	00:07:34	00:07:40	The crime lab now faces the daunting task of investigating the shooting of one of their own.
121	00:07:40	00:07:45	The wounded C.S.I. has been taken to Desert Palm where she is listed in critical condition.
122	00:07:45	00:07:48	The suspect is still at large.
123	00:07:48	00:07:49	In other news...
124	00:07:49	00:07:51	Weren’t you supposed to be shadowing Holly?
125	00:07:51	00:07:52	Warrick, man, what happened?
126	00:07:52	00:07:57	I left her to hook up with Grissom on that toenail case...
127	00:07:57	00:07:59	and then, I came back here.
128	00:07:59	00:08:00	You left Holly solo?
129	00:08:00	00:08:04	It was just supposed to be an easy print job.
130	00:08:04	00:08:07	Look, I feel bad enough, okay?
131	00:08:16	00:08:18	Here’s what we know.
132	00:08:20	00:08:23	Brass assigned Warrick to shadow Holly on a robbery.
133	00:08:23	00:08:26	He left her at the scene.
134	00:08:26	00:08:31	The suspect returned and Holly was shot.
135	00:08:31	00:08:34	The sheriff phoned me earlier this morning.
136	00:08:34	00:08:37	Brass has been moved back to homicide.
137	00:08:37	00:08:39	Who’s going to run the unit?
138	00:08:39	00:08:40	For now?
139	00:08:40	00:08:41	Me.
140	00:08:41	00:08:43	I know.
141	00:08:43	00:08:47	We’ll just play it by ear, okay?
142	00:08:47	00:08:49	All right.
143	00:08:49	00:08:53	Last night, a jackpot winner took a swan dive off the Hotel Monaco about the time Holly was shot.
144	00:08:53	00:08:55	I’m going to work the leaper.
145	00:08:55	00:08:56	Nick?
146	00:08:56	00:08:57	Yes, sir.
147	00:08:57	00:08:59	You work the Holly case.
148	00:08:59	00:09:00	Wait a minute.
149	00:09:00	00:09:02	Uh, you-you can’t give him the Holly case.
150	00:09:02	00:09:04	I mean, all due respect, Nick.
151	00:09:04	00:09:08	I want this one. Nicky is the only one that didn’t have any personal contact with Holly.
152	00:09:08	00:09:09	I don’t want you on this, Catherine.
153	00:09:09	00:09:12	Why? Because you’re emotionally involved.
154	00:09:12	00:09:13	Yeah. She was going to walk.
155	00:09:13	00:09:15	I convinced her to stay.
156	00:09:15	00:09:18	If anyone’s to blame here, it’s me, and I want this case.
157	00:09:18	00:09:19	Fire me.
158	00:09:19	00:09:21	I’m not firing anybody.
159	00:09:21	00:09:22	Look. I know we’re pulling a double.
160	00:09:22	00:09:23	We’re on edge ’cause of Holly.
161	00:09:23	00:09:28	I just want everyone to stay calm and to do their jobs for the next ten hours.
162	00:09:30	00:09:33	And as of now we’re short of help.
163	00:09:33	00:09:36	So I’m bringing in Sara Sidle to give us a hand.
164	00:09:36	00:09:38	Sara Sidle?
165	00:09:38	00:09:40	Who’s that? She’s a C.S.I. out of San Francisco.
166	00:09:40	00:09:42	She’s a friend of mine, someone I trust.
167	00:09:42	00:09:47	She’s going to handle our internal investigation and I want to keep this in-house.
168	00:09:47	00:09:49	I don’t want I.A. involved.
169	00:09:49	00:09:53	Great, that’s just what we need, somebody sniffing around.
170	00:09:57	00:10:00	Nicky, you can back me up on the D.B. at the Monaco.
171	00:10:00	00:10:01	You got it.
172	00:10:01	00:10:03	That’s it.
173	00:10:06	00:10:07	That’s it?
174	00:10:10	00:10:12	What about me?
175	00:10:12	00:10:13	You’re on leave.
176	00:10:13	00:10:15	You get some personal time.
177	00:10:15	00:10:16	I don’t want any personal time.
178	00:10:16	00:10:17	I want to help.
179	00:10:17	00:10:19	You’re the boss now.
180	00:10:19	00:10:22	You can reinstate me.
181	00:10:22	00:10:24	Go home, Warrick.
182	00:10:24	00:10:27	Get your story straight before Sara gets here.
183	00:10:40	00:10:42	A little late for the brigade.
184	00:10:44	00:10:46	What do you think happened here?
185	00:10:49	00:10:51	First blush?
186	00:10:54	00:10:55	Don’t move.
187	00:10:55	00:10:58	Hey, it’s okay. I’m not a cop.
188	00:10:58	00:11:00	I just... I just analyze the scene.
189	00:11:11	00:11:13	This is Holly’s gun.
190	00:11:18	00:11:21	She shot back.
191	00:11:39	00:11:40	He’s all rigored up.
192	00:11:40	00:11:43	Now pull it like a slot machine.
193	00:11:43	00:11:45	It’s been three weeks since my last jumper.
194	00:11:45	00:11:47	At least this one died a millionaire.
195	00:11:52	00:11:56	Jeez, these look like defensive wounds, maybe.
196	00:11:56	00:11:59	Somebody came after this guy with something pretty sharp.
197	00:12:00	00:12:02	You have any idea what it might be?
198	00:12:02	00:12:03	Glass, maybe.
199	00:12:03	00:12:06	We found tiny shards in the incised wound.
200	00:12:06	00:12:10	Take a look.
201	00:12:10	00:12:16	Not just glass-- black glass.
202	00:12:22	00:12:24	Broken glass.
203	00:12:24	00:12:28	Blood drops, leading to...
204	00:12:28	00:12:29	bloody towels.
205	00:12:29	00:12:32	No effort to hide.
206	00:12:32	00:12:33	Hey!
207	00:12:33	00:12:35	Defensive wounds.
208	00:12:35	00:12:36	Champagne bottle. Black glass.
209	00:12:36	00:12:38	I missed that.
210	00:12:43	00:12:45	What do you think, boss?
211	00:12:45	00:12:46	You’re C.S.I. Three, now.
212	00:12:46	00:12:48	You call it.
213	00:12:48	00:12:50	What? You want me to play it blind?
214	00:12:50	00:12:51	You’ve read the woman’s statement.
215	00:12:51	00:12:54	The room is full of evidentiary clues.
216	00:12:54	00:12:56	Talk it out.
217	00:12:56	00:12:58	What does the room say?
218	00:13:00	00:13:01	Okay.
219	00:13:03	00:13:08	Well, according to the girlfriend’s statement they were on the balcony when they had a lovers’ quarrel.
220	00:13:08	00:13:10	Come on, Jamie.
221	00:13:10	00:13:13	I’m a millionaire now.
222	00:13:13	00:13:16	Now, why would I want to waste any more time with you?
223	00:13:18	00:13:20	Room Service.
224	00:13:22	00:13:23	Thank you.
225	00:13:23	00:13:25	You’re welcome.
226	00:13:26	00:13:27	So what was I this whole time, huh?
227	00:13:27	00:13:29	Just someone to bang?
228	00:13:29	00:13:30	Yeah.
229	00:13:31	00:13:32	Why?!
230	00:13:38	00:13:40	Crazy broad!
231	00:13:42	00:13:44	And then what happened?
232	00:13:44	00:13:46	He took off.
233	00:13:46	00:13:48	I cut him up pretty good.
234	00:13:48	00:13:50	He probably went to the lobby to fetch some first aid.
235	00:13:50	00:13:53	And he never came back to the room?
236	00:13:53	00:13:55	No.
237	00:13:55	00:13:57	You sure?
238	00:13:57	00:14:00	The Presidential Suite at the Hotel Monaco is a secured room.
239	00:14:00	00:14:02	They keep a log.
240	00:14:02	00:14:04	Every time someone enters with a card key...
241	00:14:04	00:14:08	Well, if they keep a record check it for yourself.
242	00:14:08	00:14:10	Why are you bothering me?
243	00:14:10	00:14:13	Nicky, what does the log say?
244	00:14:13	00:14:15	Well, she’s right.
245	00:14:15	00:14:18	The only entry I see here is when hotel security checked them in.
246	00:14:18	00:14:21	Can I go now?
247	00:14:21	00:14:23	Yes, Ma’am.
248	00:14:30	00:14:31	Her story checks out.
249	00:14:32	00:14:34	She doesn’t have any financial motive.
250	00:14:34	00:14:35	She was his girlfriend, not his wife.
251	00:14:35	00:14:39	Any money won by the deceased goes directly to the family estate.
252	00:14:39	00:14:43	Well, if he didn’t fall from his own balcony where else could it have happened?
253	00:14:43	00:14:46	The roof.
254	00:14:50	00:14:52	Yeah, uh, emergency room, please.
255	00:14:54	00:14:55	Patient’s name is Holly Gribbs.
256	00:14:57	00:15:01	Thanks.
257	00:15:03	00:15:05	Warrick here.
258	00:15:05	00:15:07	Warrick, Judge Cohen.
259	00:15:07	00:15:09	You bet the wrong team, you idiot.
260	00:15:09	00:15:10	I said Packers.
261	00:15:10	00:15:13	I got the 49ers for five grand.
262	00:15:13	00:15:14	The spot in 15 minutes.
263	00:15:25	00:15:28	Okay, I think we’re ready for Operation Norman.
264	00:15:30	00:15:32	You’ll never get that off.
265	00:15:32	00:15:34	It’s Meyer’s roof dust.
266	00:15:34	00:15:36	All the hotels use it now.
267	00:15:36	00:15:38	It diverts the sun’s rays.
268	00:15:38	00:15:39	Keeps the utility bills down in the summer.
269	00:15:39	00:15:41	Yeah?
270	00:15:41	00:15:43	How do you know all this crap?
271	00:15:43	00:15:46	It’s our job to know stuff.
272	00:15:46	00:15:49	All right, Nick, standing by for Operation Norman.
273	00:15:49	00:15:52	Let him fly.
274	00:15:55	00:15:57	Oh! ( thump )
275	00:16:12	00:16:14	Yes, yes.
276	00:16:16	00:16:17	Norman pushed.
277	00:16:19	00:16:21	Norman jumped.
278	00:16:21	00:16:23	Norman fell.
279	00:16:23	00:16:25	Wouldn’t you if you were married to Mrs. Roper?
280	00:16:25	00:16:27	I don’t even have to turn around.
281	00:16:27	00:16:29	Sara Sidle.
282	00:16:29	00:16:30	That’s me.
283	00:16:30	00:16:32	Still tossing simulation dummies?
284	00:16:32	00:16:35	There are other ways to tell, you know.
285	00:16:35	00:16:36	How? Computer simulation?
286	00:16:36	00:16:38	No, thank you. I’m a scientist.
287	00:16:38	00:16:39	I like to see it.
288	00:16:39	00:16:42	Newton dropped the apple, I drop dummies.
289	00:16:42	00:16:43	You’re old school.
290	00:16:43	00:16:44	Exactly.
291	00:16:44	00:16:46	And this guy was pushed.
292	00:16:46	00:16:48	How’s the girl?
293	00:16:48	00:16:49	She’s still in surgery.
294	00:16:49	00:16:51	She’s not doing very well.
295	00:16:51	00:16:53	That’s too bad.
296	00:16:53	00:16:55	God, Sara, I have so many unanswered whys.
297	00:16:55	00:16:57	There’s only one why that matters now.
298	00:16:57	00:17:01	Why did Warrick Brown leave that scene?
299	00:17:09	00:17:11	What are you, dyslexic?
300	00:17:11	00:17:13	You owe me ten grand, buddy.
301	00:17:13	00:17:16	All I got is four.
302	00:17:16	00:17:18	So what are you breathing here for?
303	00:17:18	00:17:19	Get out there and get my money.
304	00:17:19	00:17:22	Hey, look, a girl was shot on my watch ’cause I was doing you a favor.
305	00:17:22	00:17:24	Hey, you came to me.
306	00:17:26	00:17:29	All right, Judge, I’ll get your money but I need more time.
307	00:17:29	00:17:30	You got to give me a day.
308	00:17:30	00:17:31	You got an hour.
309	00:17:34	00:17:37	Do you know where I can find Catherine Willows?
310	00:17:37	00:17:39	She’s out in the field.
311	00:17:42	00:17:44	Let me guess...
312	00:17:44	00:17:46	Sara Sidle?
313	00:17:46	00:17:47	I know who I am.
314	00:17:47	00:17:49	I think you’re a little confused.
315	00:17:49	00:17:54	If you think you’re taking my case... forget it.
316	00:17:59	00:18:03	Look, we can stand here and argue... or...
317	00:18:03	00:18:06	we can get out there and find out who did this to Holly Gribbs.
318	00:18:06	00:18:10	Two sharp women are better than one.
319	00:18:13	00:18:14	Pager.
320	00:18:14	00:18:18	Found at the crime scene.
321	00:18:18	00:18:20	Where’d you get the pager nest?
322	00:18:20	00:18:21	Grissom.
323	00:18:21	00:18:23	He won it on E-Bay.
324	00:18:23	00:18:27	They’re great for tracing if you can rely on the suspect’s honesty.
325	00:18:28	00:18:31	Uh...
326	00:18:31	00:18:32	Desmond Tutu.
327	00:18:32	00:18:34	See what I mean?
328	00:18:34	00:18:35	Don’t feel bad.
329	00:18:35	00:18:39	My last four traces came back Eminem, so...
330	00:18:40	00:18:43	Look, you seem to have everything under control here.
331	00:18:43	00:18:46	Where can I find Warrick Brown?
332	00:18:46	00:18:49	Try one of the casinos on Blue Diamond Road.
333	00:18:54	00:18:57	Oh, I’ll page you with any information.
334	00:19:10	00:19:12	There’s our jumper.
335	00:19:12	00:19:17	So, you want to see everything one minute before and one minute after he won the jackpot, right?
336	00:19:17	00:19:18	Please.
337	00:19:20	00:19:22	Wait a minute.
338	00:19:22	00:19:24	Go back.
339	00:19:25	00:19:30	There! It looks like she’s offering him his slot redemption card back.
340	00:19:30	00:19:35	Could I see the person that was sitting at this machine right before the victim?
341	00:19:35	00:19:36	Sure.
342	00:19:39	00:19:43	Is there any way of telling how long he was sitting there?
343	00:19:50	00:19:53	11 hours, 13 minutes...
344	00:19:53	00:19:55	15 seconds.
345	00:19:55	00:20:00	At three bucks a tug hell, he could have gone through ten, 20 thou.
346	00:20:03	00:20:06	Nick, call the slot host.
347	00:20:06	00:20:08	Get this guy’s name from the slot card.
348	00:20:08	00:20:09	I want to talk to this man.
349	00:20:09	00:20:11	All right.
350	00:20:11	00:20:12	Here you go.
351	00:20:12	00:20:14	Holly’s weapon’s already loaded.
352	00:20:14	00:20:16	So just point at the gun entry hole there to do your test fire.
353	00:20:16	00:20:18	Okay, thanks, Bobby.
354	00:20:30	00:20:39	Okay, now, in order to eliminate Holly’s gun as the possible weapon we start by looking for imperfections in the bullet’s stria...
355	00:20:39	00:20:42	Now, that’s odd.
356	00:20:42	00:20:44	What’s wrong?
357	00:20:44	00:20:45	We don’t have an elimination.
358	00:20:45	00:20:46	We got a match.
359	00:20:58	00:21:00	Shot her with her own gun.
360	00:21:00	00:21:02	It’s okay, I’m not a cop.
361	00:21:02	00:21:04	I just... I just analyze the scene.
362	00:21:04	00:21:05	Throw the gun down!
363	00:21:05	00:21:08	All right now, yank the phone out of the wall.
364	00:21:08	00:21:10	I’m taking my prints with me.
365	00:21:28	00:21:31	I pulled the slot card for you.
366	00:21:31	00:21:32	That’s the gentleman, right over there.
367	00:21:32	00:21:33	Thank you.
368	00:21:33	00:21:35	Mm-hmm.
369	00:21:35	00:21:36	Hold this.
370	00:21:36	00:21:38	I think I’ll play a little.
371	00:21:45	00:21:47	Double down, now baby.
372	00:21:47	00:21:48	Oh, yes, a winner.
373	00:21:48	00:21:50	The winner.
374	00:21:52	00:21:54	Double nine. Jacks or better.
375	00:21:58	00:21:59	You’re under arrest.
376	00:21:59	00:22:01	Oh yeah?
377	00:22:01	00:22:02	What for?
378	00:22:02	00:22:03	First-degree murder.
379	00:22:03	00:22:05	Oh.
380	00:22:05	00:22:07	On what grounds?
381	00:22:07	00:22:10	Roof dust.
382	00:22:11	00:22:14	Sir, would you please come with us?
383	00:22:19	00:22:21	Nicky, my boy, collect my winnings.
384	00:22:21	00:22:24	It’s a C.S.I. Three initiation.
385	00:22:41	00:22:42	You’re up 11 Gs.
386	00:22:42	00:22:44	Hit or stay?
387	00:22:44	00:22:45	Stay.
388	00:22:45	00:22:47	I want to talk to you.
389	00:22:51	00:22:53	You were playing $100 on every spot.
390	00:22:53	00:22:56	You have a system?
391	00:22:56	00:22:58	I’m counting cards.
392	00:22:58	00:22:59	Isn’t that illegal?
393	00:22:59	00:23:02	Not if you do the math in your head.
394	00:23:02	00:23:04	You play anything else?
395	00:23:06	00:23:09	I bet sports from time to time.
396	00:23:09	00:23:12	So...
397	00:23:12	00:23:13	let me get this straight.
398	00:23:13	00:23:16	You were assigned by Brass to shadow a trainee.
399	00:23:16	00:23:19	A robbery comes up on M.L.K, and you go for coffee.
400	00:23:19	00:23:21	An officer was there.
401	00:23:21	00:23:22	So you felt safe to leave.
402	00:23:22	00:23:26	Do you know the policies and procedures for clearing a scene?
403	00:23:26	00:23:27	Yes.
404	00:23:27	00:23:29	Then, why’d you leave?
405	00:23:29	00:23:31	I mean, what was so important that you had to rush out of there?
406	00:23:31	00:23:33	I told you.
407	00:23:33	00:23:34	I went for coffee.
408	00:23:34	00:23:37	Was that before or after you made your bets?
409	00:23:37	00:23:40	Sunday...
410	00:23:40	00:23:41	Vegas...
411	00:23:41	00:23:43	NFL football...
412	00:23:43	00:23:44	guy like you...
413	00:23:44	00:23:47	Come on, you trying to tell me that you didn’t make a little pit stop?
414	00:23:49	00:23:51	Look at me.
415	00:23:51	00:23:54	Did you log on...
416	00:23:54	00:23:56	tell dispatch where you were going?
417	00:23:56	00:24:00	Do you know how many times I’ve been left alone at a crime scene when I was a rookie?
418	00:24:00	00:24:03	Yeah, well, this time is different.
419	00:24:03	00:24:05	Yeah, why’s that?
420	00:24:05	00:24:09	Holly Gribbs died on the operating table 20 minutes ago.
421	00:25:05	00:25:07	Mind if I get a soda?
422	00:25:08	00:25:11	Oh, yeah. Sorry.
423	00:25:11	00:25:13	You want one?
424	00:25:13	00:25:16	Is there anything in there with alcohol?
425	00:25:16	00:25:17	Root beer.
426	00:25:17	00:25:20	No.
427	00:25:23	00:25:24	Uh-uh.
428	00:25:27	00:25:30	Oh... God.
429	00:25:33	00:25:34	What are you going to say?
430	00:25:34	00:25:36	Hi, I’m a criminalist. I was in the neighborhood...
431	00:25:36	00:25:38	Shh. It’s ringing.
432	00:25:38	00:25:40	Hello.
433	00:25:40	00:25:42	Uh, hey.
434	00:25:42	00:25:43	Hey, who’s this?
435	00:25:43	00:25:44	I just dialed my own damn beeper.
436	00:25:44	00:25:46	Uh-uh. It’s my beeper now.
437	00:25:46	00:25:47	I found it.
438	00:25:47	00:25:50	It ain’t your beeper, girl.
439	00:25:50	00:25:51	It’s mine.
440	00:25:51	00:25:53	I do a lot of business on that beeper.
441	00:25:53	00:25:54	What kind of business?
442	00:25:54	00:25:58	You know-- Slinging a little something-something.
443	00:25:58	00:26:00	Oh, a little something-something.
444	00:26:00	00:26:03	Or maybe a little bling-bling?
445	00:26:03	00:26:07	So what you know about some bling-bling?
446	00:26:07	00:26:11	Well, invite me over to your crib, baby and you might find out.
447	00:26:11	00:26:12	It’s on.
448	00:26:12	00:26:15	Three Aces Motel, room 202.
449	00:26:15	00:26:18	Three Aces Motel, room 202.
450	00:26:20	00:26:21	See you soon.
451	00:26:25	00:26:27	Did I just do that?
452	00:26:27	00:26:28	What’s a bling-bling?
453	00:26:28	00:26:32	Got me.
454	00:26:32	00:26:34	Yeah, I was up on that roof.
455	00:26:34	00:26:37	I didn’t push him off.
456	00:26:37	00:26:38	I did talk to him, though.
457	00:26:38	00:26:40	We know.
458	00:26:40	00:26:41	Hey, what did you drink?
459	00:26:41	00:26:44	Gin and tonic or amaretto sours?
460	00:26:44	00:26:46	Amaretto sours. How’d you know that?
461	00:26:46	00:26:49	We got a record of the victim’s room charges.
462	00:26:49	00:26:50	Chief.
463	00:26:50	00:26:51	27 a.m.
464	00:26:51	00:26:59	our victim, Ted Salinger, made a couple of purchases in the gift shop-- Band-Aids and antiseptic.
465	00:26:59	00:27:00	40 a.m.
466	00:27:00	00:27:10	we tracked a purchase at the La Promenade-- A $30,000 designer watch.
467	00:27:10	00:27:16	45 a.m., you both started knocking them back in the hotel bar.
468	00:27:16	00:27:17	Sweet.
469	00:27:17	00:27:18	Hey.
470	00:27:18	00:27:20	You won my money.
471	00:27:20	00:27:21	What?
472	00:27:21	00:27:22	That was my machine.
473	00:27:22	00:27:24	I put everything I had in that machine.
474	00:27:24	00:27:26	So you’re a degenerate.
475	00:27:26	00:27:27	What do you want from me?
476	00:27:31	00:27:33	Hey, old timer, come on, sit down.
477	00:27:33	00:27:35	I’ll buy you a drink for second place.
478	00:27:35	00:27:37	What are you having? It’s on me.
479	00:27:37	00:27:39	It’s on you? All right.
480	00:27:39	00:27:41	In that case, I’ll have a, uh...
481	00:27:41	00:27:43	amaretto sour.
482	00:27:43	00:27:48	The first hour, you both drank tit for tat but by hour two, Ted started ordering doubles...
483	00:27:48	00:27:50	And you quit drinking.
484	00:27:50	00:27:53	Drank decaf coffee instead.
485	00:27:53	00:27:58	My guess is that you were getting him lathered up for your little elevator ride.
486	00:27:58	00:28:00	Have a nice life, huh?
487	00:28:00	00:28:01	I know I will.
488	00:28:02	00:28:06	And from there, you went to the roof.
489	00:28:33	00:28:36	I couldn’t go through with it.
490	00:28:36	00:28:38	I’m a born failure.
491	00:28:38	00:28:40	I failed at my marriage; I failed at my work.
492	00:28:40	00:28:44	Then I couldn’t even commit suicide right.
493	00:28:48	00:28:52	One pull away... the story of my life.
494	00:28:56	00:28:59	Mr. Carlton, we’re not detectives.
495	00:28:59	00:29:00	We’re crime scene analysts.
496	00:29:00	00:29:07	We’re trained to ignore verbal accounts and rely instead on the evidence a scene sets before us.
497	00:29:07	00:29:11	But I have to be honest with you, Red...
498	00:29:11	00:29:13	I believe you.
499	00:29:13	00:29:14	I do.
500	00:29:17	00:29:18	So...
501	00:29:21	00:29:24	you’re going to stay here until we get back.
502	00:29:24	00:29:29	If you pushed this guy off the roof he will, without a doubt, have roof dust on his shoes.
503	00:29:29	00:29:34	If he does we’ll have you arrested for murder.
504	00:29:34	00:29:38	But if dust is not present, then you’ll be free to go.
505	00:29:46	00:29:48	I like this guy.
506	00:29:59	00:30:01	What are you doing here?
507	00:30:01	00:30:02	Guilt therapy.
508	00:30:07	00:30:09	Police officers! Open up!
509	00:30:15	00:30:16	Get down.
510	00:30:16	00:30:18	Hold him down on the ground!
511	00:30:18	00:30:20	Put your hands behind your back!
512	00:30:20	00:30:21	Get him down!
513	00:30:23	00:30:24	Now that’s a bling-bling.
514	00:30:24	00:30:26	That was you on the phone?
515	00:30:26	00:30:28	Yep.
516	00:30:32	00:30:34	Where’d you get that scratch?
517	00:30:37	00:30:41	For a conviction, we’re going to need a DNA sample.
518	00:30:41	00:30:43	Okay, let’s sit him down.
519	00:30:43	00:30:46	Let’s get a saliva sample.
520	00:30:46	00:30:47	Hey, guys, it’s Catherine.
521	00:30:47	00:30:51	For whoever is listening we got him.
522	00:30:51	00:30:55	Repeat. Holly Gribbs’ suspect is in custody.
523	00:30:59	00:31:00	10,000.
524	00:31:00	00:31:02	See you around, Judge.
525	00:31:02	00:31:05	You don’t leave until I tell you to leave.
526	00:31:05	00:31:07	What?
527	00:31:07	00:31:09	What are you going to do, hold me in contempt?
528	00:31:09	00:31:11	You’re already in contempt with me.
529	00:31:11	00:31:13	We’re in bed, pal.
530	00:31:13	00:31:15	I own you.
531	00:31:15	00:31:16	Nobody owns me.
532	00:31:16	00:31:17	Yeah?
533	00:31:17	00:31:19	Let me tell you something.
534	00:31:19	00:31:22	You ever heard of a wolf in sheep’s clothing?
535	00:31:22	00:31:27	You and me we’re going to do business together whether you like it or not.
536	00:31:28	00:31:30	Keep your cell phone charged.
537	00:31:44	00:31:45	You didn’t have to come.
538	00:31:45	00:31:49	I know. I wanted to.
539	00:31:49	00:31:51	In case you need me.
540	00:31:51	00:31:53	I probably do.
541	00:31:53	00:31:56	But this is something I’d rather do alone.
542	00:31:59	00:32:05	15 seconds, you’re in, you’re out we make a DNA match and it’s over, okay?
543	00:32:05	00:32:08	Okay.
544	00:33:02	00:33:05	I’m sorry.
545	00:33:13	00:33:16	Will the real Red Skelton please...
546	00:33:16	00:33:17	stand up?
547	00:33:17	00:33:20	You’re too young to remember who Red Skelton was.
548	00:33:20	00:33:22	Hey, Nick at Nite.
549	00:33:22	00:33:24	You should check it out.
550	00:33:33	00:33:34	No dust.
551	00:33:34	00:33:35	Great.
552	00:33:35	00:33:37	I thought so.
553	00:33:37	00:33:40	Turns out he’s red herring.
554	00:33:42	00:33:45	There’s got to be something else.
555	00:34:01	00:34:03	Nice watch.
556	00:34:06	00:34:08	Look at this.
557	00:34:09	00:34:12	These look like fibers.
558	00:34:12	00:34:14	Yeah. You think he was dragged?
559	00:34:14	00:34:17	Maybe.
560	00:34:17	00:34:19	Well, I’ll go back to the presidential suite...
561	00:34:19	00:34:22	take a swatch of the carpet, see if we can match the fibers.
562	00:34:22	00:34:24	Get ahold of the girl while you’re at it.
563	00:34:24	00:34:25	Why, is she a suspect?
564	00:34:25	00:34:27	She is now.
565	00:34:27	00:34:29	All right.
566	00:34:32	00:34:34	What do you have?
567	00:34:34	00:34:37	Hey. I thought you might like to see this.
568	00:34:41	00:34:43	What the hell is that?
569	00:34:43	00:34:45	I found it after I shaved his head.
570	00:34:45	00:34:48	Something hard with a diamond insignia on the back.
571	00:34:48	00:34:52	You find that, I bet you find your killer.
572	00:34:52	00:34:53	Was this first blow?
573	00:34:53	00:34:55	First and fatal.
574	00:34:55	00:34:56	Crushed his skull.
575	00:34:56	00:34:58	So he was killed, then he was pushed.
576	00:34:58	00:35:00	Without a doubt.
577	00:35:05	00:35:07	Nicorette?
578	00:35:07	00:35:10	No, thanks. Got my own.
579	00:35:10	00:35:14	Willows... your DNA results are back.
580	00:35:22	00:35:32	Well, according to my DNA data the types are 814 quadrillion to one that your suspect is our killer.
581	00:35:32	00:35:33	Pretty good stats! Whoo!
582	00:35:33	00:35:37	Yeah, considering there’s only about six billion people in the world...
583	00:35:37	00:35:39	Ah, thanks.
584	00:35:39	00:35:41	Mm-hmm.
585	00:35:42	00:35:44	Holly...
586	00:35:45	00:35:48	She gave me just enough...
587	00:35:48	00:35:52	just enough to catch him.
588	00:35:52	00:35:53	Don’t move!
589	00:35:53	00:35:54	Hey, hey, it’s okay.
590	00:35:54	00:35:55	I’m not a cop.
591	00:35:55	00:35:58	I just... I just analyze the scene.
592	00:35:58	00:35:59	This is my first day.
593	00:35:59	00:36:01	Believe me, I’m-I’m no threat.
594	00:36:01	00:36:03	Um, look...
595	00:36:03	00:36:05	phone with your prints on it?
596	00:36:05	00:36:07	Here, take it.
597	00:36:07	00:36:09	Okay? Here.
598	00:36:17	00:36:21	But she held on long enough to give us a clue.
599	00:36:47	00:36:49	Nice work, Catherine.
600	00:37:10	00:37:12	Nice swatch, Nick.
601	00:37:12	00:37:15	Pizza-box-sized.
602	00:38:25	00:38:26	Grissom.
603	00:38:26	00:38:28	It’s Nick.
604	00:38:28	00:38:30	I just finished the carpet swatch comparisons.
605	00:38:30	00:38:32	Got a match.
606	00:38:32	00:38:34	I’m starting to get that feeling, Nicky, my boy.
607	00:38:34	00:38:36	Yeah, so am I.
608	00:38:36	00:38:38	Listen, I’ll meet you at the interrogation.
609	00:38:38	00:38:39	I still got one more thing I want to check.
610	00:38:39	00:38:42	Okay. Bye.
611	00:38:42	00:38:45	Okay, I’m ready to try this now.
612	00:38:45	00:38:48	Stand by, house.
613	00:38:53	00:38:54	Did your security log record that?
614	00:38:54	00:38:56	You guys get that?
615	00:38:56	00:38:59	No.
616	00:38:59	00:39:01	Well, I’ll be damned.
617	00:39:01	00:39:03	The curse.
618	00:39:03	00:39:05	Hell, I ain’t playing those machines no more.
619	00:39:05	00:39:07	It’s true.
620	00:39:07	00:39:10	You win, you die.
621	00:39:11	00:39:12	Gotcha.
622	00:39:12	00:39:14	Got me with what?
623	00:39:14	00:39:15	Capital murder.
624	00:39:15	00:39:16	Oh, are you kidding me?
625	00:39:16	00:39:19	I never kid about murder.
626	00:39:19	00:39:21	What do you think, Nick?
627	00:39:21	00:39:23	My turn to play it blind?
628	00:39:27	00:39:29	Hey, Red, have a nice life, huh?
629	00:39:30	00:39:32	I know I will.
630	00:39:32	00:39:34	Loser.
631	00:39:36	00:39:37	What the...?
632	00:39:42	00:39:44	What the hell’s with this thing?
633	00:39:47	00:39:55	Now, the funny thing is if Ted didn’t come back to the room then why were presidential carpet fibers found in the band of his brand-new watch?
634	00:39:55	00:39:57	’Cause he did come back.
635	00:39:57	00:40:02	after you throw him over the balcony you cleaned up the crime scene.
636	00:40:02	00:40:04	You left blood-soaked towels in plain sight.
637	00:40:04	00:40:06	Your alibi?
638	00:40:06	00:40:09	The blood came from Ted’s forearms.
639	00:40:09	00:40:11	How am I doing so far, Nicky?
640	00:40:11	00:40:12	Yeah, I’m into it.
641	00:40:12	00:40:25	According to your statement, you felt slighted ’cause Ted had just won $40 million and dumped you within half an hour giving you motive enough to kill him and you exercised that motive.
642	00:40:32	00:40:34	Can I ask you a question?
643	00:40:34	00:40:35	Sure.
644	00:40:35	00:40:36	How are you so cool?
645	00:40:36	00:40:39	You took someone’s life.
646	00:40:39	00:40:41	Don’t you care?
647	00:40:43	00:40:45	No.
648	00:40:47	00:40:51	Deputy, we’re going to have her arrested.
649	00:40:51	00:40:54	So, could I ask you a question?
650	00:40:54	00:40:55	Maybe.
651	00:40:55	00:40:57	All that stuff you rattled off.
652	00:40:57	00:40:59	How’d you know about all that?
653	00:40:59	00:41:02	Your boyfriend told me.
654	00:41:10	00:41:13	I’ll see you outside, okay?
655	00:41:22	00:41:25	They say I have to let you go.
656	00:41:25	00:41:29	You violated the policies and procedures for clearing a scene.
657	00:41:31	00:41:33	I read Sara’s report.
658	00:41:33	00:41:36	I know.
659	00:41:37	00:41:40	I messed up.
660	00:41:40	00:41:42	And Holly’s dead.
661	00:41:53	00:41:55	I’m sorry, Gil.
662	00:41:55	00:41:58	I’m sorry, too.
663	00:41:58	00:42:01	I don’t want to do this.
664	00:42:01	00:42:03	You got to.
665	00:42:03	00:42:07	You know where I was?
666	00:42:07	00:42:10	I think I have a pretty good idea.
667	00:42:10	00:42:12	I went to lay a bet.
668	00:42:14	00:42:17	I didn’t even think I was doing anything wrong.
669	00:42:17	00:42:19	Never occurred to me.
670	00:42:21	00:42:24	It never occurred to me, either.
671	00:42:27	00:42:29	You know what?
672	00:42:29	00:42:34	If I let you go I got to let me go, too.
673	00:42:34	00:42:37	And Catherine and Brass, we’re all culpable in this.
674	00:42:37	00:42:40	I don’t care what the book says.
675	00:42:40	00:42:41	I lost one good person today.
676	00:42:41	00:42:43	I don’t want to lose another--here.
677	00:42:55	00:42:58	I won’t let you down again.
678	00:43:37	00:43:39	Let’s go home.
