0	00:00:34	00:00:37	Hank Connors, Las Vegas Police.
1	00:00:37	00:00:39	Come out with your hands above your head.
2	00:00:39	00:00:42	Come out slowly.
3	00:01:04	00:01:05	Officer down!
4	00:01:17	00:01:20	Go back where you came from!
5	00:01:20	00:01:23	You're not taking me!
6	00:01:29	00:01:30	Circle the perimeter.
7	00:01:31	00:01:32	Move in, three-two.
8	00:02:40	00:02:47	MREs, automatic weapons, ammo, water-- this guy Connors was ready for the end of days.
9	00:02:48	00:02:51	Which, in his case, was today.
10	00:02:51	00:02:53	Bomb squad find any booby traps?
11	00:02:53	00:02:55	No, he liked it mano a mano.
12	00:02:55	00:02:58	Any sign of Chyna De Vere?
13	00:02:58	00:03:01	Not yet.
14	00:03:09	00:03:14	You know, there's some food, you just shouldn't see where it comes from.
15	00:03:15	00:03:20	Did you know that pigs are very intelligent animals, right behind chimps, dolphins and elephants?
16	00:03:20	00:03:22	Ahead of dogs?
17	00:03:22	00:03:23	And certain politicians.
18	00:03:25	00:03:28	I don't see Connors' truck anywhere.
19	00:03:28	00:03:30	Let's look in the barn.
20	00:03:48	00:03:50	There's the truck.
21	00:03:59	00:04:02	If this is Chyna De Vere's blood, we're getting warmer.
22	00:04:16	00:04:20	Looks like he had a hobby-- stuffed animals.
23	00:04:32	00:04:34	Hey, Warrick.
24	00:04:34	00:04:36	Yeah?
25	00:04:36	00:04:38	I feel like Marco Polo.
26	00:04:38	00:04:41	Why's that?
27	00:04:41	00:04:43	I just discovered Chyna.
28	00:05:23	00:05:24	This is a career first.
29	00:05:25	00:05:29	A little tip for you The new Mrs. Phillips doesn't need to hear about this.
30	00:05:29	00:05:30	Are you kidding me?
31	00:05:30	00:05:31	She'll want to hear every detail.
32	00:05:31	00:05:35	Why do you think I married her?
33	00:05:35	00:05:37	Come on, pretty girl, come on.
34	00:05:41	00:05:42	Come on. Hi.
35	00:05:42	00:05:43	Hey.
36	00:05:43	00:05:44	What are you doing?
37	00:05:44	00:05:49	Well, I read about this farmer in Canada who killed a bunch of women and fed them to his pigs.
38	00:05:49	00:05:50	Oh.
39	00:05:50	00:05:56	Yeah, their health department had to put out a bulletin that said, your pork may be contaminated with human.
40	00:05:56	00:05:58	I'm so glad I'm a vegetarian.
41	00:05:59	00:06:01	Get through there!
42	00:06:01	00:06:08	Well, no one has seen or heard from the victim's husband, so... I kind of figured he may have been dessert.
43	00:06:12	00:06:14	I think the fat one likes you.
44	00:06:14	00:06:17	They always do.
45	00:06:17	00:06:21	We went to Connors' ranch because a week ago, Chyna De Vere went missing.
46	00:06:21	00:06:24	She just separated from her husband, got her own place.
47	00:06:24	00:06:30	This is a large section of her living room carpet-- wet to the touch, pheno confirmed a blood pool.
48	00:06:30	00:06:33	Well, it's certainly enough blood to suggest foul play.
49	00:06:33	00:06:41	There were also traces of perchloroethylene, phosphates, alcohol, ethers and sodium hypocholorite.
50	00:06:41	00:06:43	Used a steam cleaner.
51	00:06:43	00:06:45	Would've denatured any DNA.
52	00:06:45	00:06:47	Yeah, we checked all the local places that rent them.
53	00:06:47	00:06:49	Connors' name didn't come up.
54	00:06:49	00:06:50	How about the husband's?
55	00:06:50	00:06:51	Nope.
56	00:06:51	00:06:53	And he's still missing.
57	00:06:53	00:06:54	So what's this?
58	00:06:54	00:07:00	That is a single, distinct blood drop-- not from the victim, not from the husband.
59	00:07:00	00:07:02	They didn't clean the whole carpet.
60	00:07:02	00:07:03	Unknown female.
61	00:07:03	00:07:08	We also found soil trace, identified as scheelite, a tungsten ore.
62	00:07:08	00:07:13	Apparently, Connors' ranch is near old tungsten mines by McCade.
63	00:07:13	00:07:16	How is Connors, this pig farmer, connected to the victim?
64	00:07:16	00:07:20	Oh, he's in kind of a club with the victim's husband.
65	00:07:20	00:07:22	Kind of a club?
66	00:08:11	00:08:14	Want me to take the living room?
67	00:08:14	00:08:16	Looks like Armageddon came on a Thursday.
68	00:08:16	00:08:20	Do you believe that intelligent life exists on other planets?
69	00:08:20	00:08:23	I'm not sure there's intelligent life on this planet.
70	00:08:23	00:08:24	I was just in the barn.
71	00:08:26	00:08:28	I'll get started.
72	00:08:32	00:08:34	Ms. Turner.
73	00:08:34	00:08:37	I already went through this a week ago.
74	00:08:37	00:08:39	You know, you're right.
75	00:08:39	00:08:40	But let's go through it again.
76	00:08:42	00:08:44	Chyna De Vere is dead.
77	00:08:44	00:08:46	And her remains were found on your boyfriend's ranch.
78	00:08:46	00:08:49	Yeah, not my boyfriend-- my friend.
79	00:08:49	00:08:53	And furthermore, I never knew Chyna De Vere.
80	00:08:53	00:08:54	She wasn't a member of your club?
81	00:08:54	00:08:56	No.
82	00:08:56	00:08:58	If she was, I would have known her, and I didn't.
83	00:08:58	00:08:59	Her husband was.
84	00:08:59	00:09:01	And he's MIA.
85	00:09:01	00:09:03	You know, the club's getting smaller and smaller by the minute.
86	00:09:03	00:09:06	This morning, Hank Connors died.
87	00:09:06	00:09:11	When we went up there to arrest your friend, he shot himself.
88	00:09:11	00:09:16	And I'm getting the feeling that you're going to be missing a meeting, too.
89	00:09:16	00:09:18	Look, Shannon, you alibied a killer.
90	00:09:18	00:09:22	You're already an accessory to one murder.
91	00:09:22	00:09:24	If Hank Connors killed Chyna's husband, too...
92	00:09:24	00:09:27	Oh.
93	00:09:27	00:09:29	Oh, is that what you think happened?
94	00:09:29	00:09:31	Tell me where he is.
95	00:09:31	00:09:34	Hmm?
96	00:09:34	00:09:36	You know, this can work in your favor with the D.A.
97	00:09:36	00:09:39	Oh, you know what?
98	00:09:39	00:09:42	I'm not really worried about that.
99	00:10:16	00:10:21	Adam and Eve were not only the first humans on the Earth, they were bait...
100	00:10:21	00:10:27	for intelligent life forms elsewhere in the cosmos, refugees from planets that could no longer sustain them.
101	00:10:27	00:10:31	But why Earth?
102	00:10:31	00:10:33	Deoxyribonucleic acid.
103	00:10:33	00:10:35	DNA.
104	00:10:35	00:10:40	The blueprint of human life is the key to their survival.
105	00:10:41	00:10:44	Without it, they will perish.
106	00:10:47	00:10:48	Hi, Ms. Turner.
107	00:10:49	00:10:52	My name's Greg Sanders; I'm with the crime lab.
108	00:10:52	00:10:55	I have a warrant to take a sample of your DNA.
109	00:10:55	00:10:56	You're not touching me.
110	00:10:56	00:11:00	Well, ma'am, this is standard procedure.
111	00:11:00	00:11:01	I know who you are.
112	00:11:01	00:11:03	I'm just going to swab the inside of...
113	00:11:03	00:11:05	Hey! Not!
114	00:11:05	00:11:06	Calm down.
115	00:11:06	00:11:07	Get off of me!
116	00:11:07	00:11:10	Calm down, ma'am. All of you, Calm down. get away from me!
117	00:11:10	00:11:12	Get him away from...!
118	00:11:12	00:11:13	Calm down.
119	00:11:13	00:11:14	No!
120	00:11:14	00:11:16	Let's try this again.
121	00:11:21	00:11:24	Let go of his hand! Let go of his hand, ma'am.
122	00:11:25	00:11:26	That bitch bit me.
123	00:11:29	00:11:30	I got my sample.
124	00:11:31	00:11:40	The first encounters between humans and extraterrestrials took place over a hundred thousand years ago in Atlantis, and in its sister civilization in the Pacific, Lemuria.
125	00:11:40	00:11:46	Ancient civilizations on every continent have recorded evidence of these encounters.
126	00:11:46	00:11:51	These visitors were highly advanced and did not appear in human form.
127	00:11:51	00:12:00	Now, the Mayans called them Chanes-- people of the serpents-- and in Hebrew legend, the snake represented knowledge.
128	00:12:00	00:12:02	Of course it did.
129	00:12:03	00:12:05	It was not human.
130	00:12:05	00:12:07	Not of this Earth.
131	00:12:16	00:12:19	Shannon sure has a lot of books.
132	00:12:19	00:12:22	UFO's, alien abduction...
133	00:12:22	00:12:25	Chyna was a dealer at the Palermo.
134	00:12:25	00:12:27	Looks like Shannon was a player.
135	00:12:28	00:12:29	Gold level.
136	00:12:29	00:12:32	Yeah, tell me they never met.
137	00:12:32	00:12:34	We'll check the Palermo security.
138	00:12:40	00:12:42	Reptiles...
139	00:12:42	00:12:44	UFOs...
140	00:12:44	00:12:46	Xena, Warrior Princess.
141	00:12:46	00:12:50	History is replete with stories of the heroic destruction of serpents.
142	00:12:50	00:12:56	Perseus and Medusa, St. George and the Dragon, St. Patrick and the Snakes of Ireland.
143	00:12:56	00:12:57	But these are not merely legends...
144	00:12:57	00:12:58	What is this?
145	00:12:58	00:13:02	I think their UFO club is based on the teachings of this guy.
146	00:13:02	00:13:05	...and the natural form of these invaders is not human.
147	00:13:05	00:13:10	They are described in ancient accounts as serpents and dragons.
148	00:13:10	00:13:14	And man's weapon against them is the sword.
149	00:13:14	00:13:18	Cut off the tail, the serpent lives.
150	00:13:18	00:13:21	Cut off its head, and it dies.
151	00:13:21	00:13:28	So Connors cut off her head because he thought she was a serpent from outer space?
152	00:13:33	00:13:35	Catherine...
153	00:13:35	00:13:37	check this out.
154	00:13:40	00:13:43	Chyna De Vere's husband Preston.
155	00:13:43	00:13:46	What's Shannon doing with him?
156	00:13:46	00:13:47	Chillin' in Cabo.
157	00:13:58	00:14:00	Aww.
158	00:14:02	00:14:06	Well, while Mommy's in custody, I guess the kitty's hungry; I'll call Animal Control.
159	00:14:08	00:14:10	Oh, Jim...
160	00:14:14	00:14:17	Well, hello, Xena.
161	00:15:16	00:15:18	Oh, boy.
162	00:15:18	00:15:20	Look what he used on the incision.
163	00:15:20	00:15:22	Duct tape?
164	00:15:22	00:15:27	Yeah, he used it to close up the laceration from a sharp force perimortem wound.
165	00:15:27	00:15:31	Corresponds to the indentation in the skull.
166	00:15:31	00:15:33	Could that be the fatal wound?
167	00:15:33	00:15:35	Give me the rest of the body and I can tell you.
168	00:15:35	00:15:37	Nick's working on it.
169	00:15:37	00:15:42	Almost three inches, smooth-edge blade; you know, Catherine found-- Yeah, I heard.
170	00:15:42	00:15:45	A sword-- everyone's talking about this one.
171	00:15:46	00:15:50	Why would anybody want to taxidermy a human head?
172	00:15:50	00:15:51	I'm still working on the how.
173	00:15:51	00:15:53	That, I can tell you.
174	00:15:53	00:15:55	Mounted one myself.
175	00:15:55	00:15:57	A deer-- Dad was a hunter.
176	00:15:57	00:16:01	First, our guy had to separate the head from the body.
177	00:16:01	00:16:06	For that, he used a serrated-edge knife.
178	00:16:06	00:16:09	Dad used a carving knife, same one we used at Thanksgiving.
179	00:16:09	00:16:11	When mom found out, she almost killed him with it.
180	00:16:12	00:16:13	Heartwarming.
181	00:16:13	00:16:15	Yeah, so then...
182	00:16:15	00:16:19	he had to flesh the skin away from the underlying muscle.
183	00:16:23	00:16:28	Next, he would've stretched the skin out on a board, rubbed it with rock salt...
184	00:16:30	00:16:32	...then waited two days.
185	00:16:32	00:16:39	Then he tanned the skin to preserve it, hydrated it with a borax and water solution to keep the bugs off.
186	00:16:39	00:16:45	Next, he cleaned the skull, filled the imperfections with clay, sawdust, anything at hand.
187	00:16:45	00:16:50	Popped in two glass eyes, and then...
188	00:16:52	00:16:55	And he's got the best-looking wall mount the neighborhood.
189	00:16:56	00:16:58	We're going to need to process that toolmark.
190	00:16:58	00:17:00	Yeah, I'll get it over to CSI.
191	00:17:19	00:17:21	Oh... nice sword.
192	00:17:21	00:17:23	Mm-hmm!
193	00:17:23	00:17:24	I dated a guy on the fencing team.
194	00:17:24	00:17:26	His thighs were incredible.
195	00:17:26	00:17:28	Did you want to show me something?
196	00:17:28	00:17:31	Yes, the, uh, tip has been wiped clean.
197	00:17:31	00:17:32	Negative for blood.
198	00:17:33	00:17:38	But I did find a couple of partials on the blade just above the hilt.
199	00:17:38	00:17:43	Okay. And a couple of full prints on the handle.
200	00:17:43	00:17:48	The femur measures 461 millimeters.
201	00:17:50	00:17:54	Gives us a height for a white female of 5'6.
202	00:17:54	00:17:56	Exactly Chyna's height.
203	00:17:56	00:17:57	How about for a male?
204	00:17:57	00:17:59	5'7. Preston De Vere is too tall.
205	00:17:59	00:18:01	Did you measure the head of the femur?
206	00:18:01	00:18:03	No, sir, I was just about to.
207	00:18:08	00:18:10	41 point s... point five millimeters.
208	00:18:10	00:18:12	It's a female.
209	00:18:12	00:18:14	You want my theory?
210	00:18:15	00:18:17	This little piggy went to market.
211	00:18:17	00:18:19	This little piggy stayed home.
212	00:18:19	00:18:21	This little piggy had Chyna.
213	00:18:21	00:18:24	Yeah.
214	00:18:24	00:18:27	Human teeth aren't strong enough to leave these marks.
215	00:18:27	00:18:31	And it is consistent with Connors chopping off her head and tossing his girls a bone.
216	00:18:31	00:18:34	Okay... go back to the ranch.
217	00:18:34	00:18:36	See if you can find the rest of her.
218	00:18:38	00:18:39	Hey, Greg.
219	00:18:39	00:18:41	You up for a bite?
220	00:18:51	00:18:53	No.
221	00:18:53	00:18:59	I am on antibiotics, I had a tetanus shot-- I'm having a pretty bad year.
222	00:18:59	00:19:02	Oh, it's only a bad year if you do a bad job, Greg.
223	00:19:02	00:19:04	You're having a great year.
224	00:19:06	00:19:08	I got that gel ready for you.
225	00:20:02	00:20:04	Voilà!
226	00:20:04	00:20:05	We have our weapon?
227	00:20:05	00:20:13	Yeah, and a mounted human head, a suicidal pig farmer, a missing husband, and a bunch of UFO believers.
228	00:20:13	00:20:15	What could be next?
229	00:20:29	00:20:33	Wendy got results back on the blood from Connors' workbench in the pickup truck.
230	00:20:33	00:20:35	It's Chyna De Vere.
231	00:20:35	00:20:38	Good. Come here, take a look at this.
232	00:20:43	00:20:46	Hey, isn't that, uh...? Yeah.
233	00:20:46	00:20:52	You can see Dick Cheney, Al Gore, all nine Supreme Court Justices shape-shift into Reptilians.
234	00:20:52	00:21:04	Did you know that, for thousands of years, creatures from the constellation Draco have been mating with humans to form a super-race that includes 43 U.S. presidents, most members of Congress, and the entire British royal family?
235	00:21:04	00:21:07	Hey, did Shannon Turner have a cat? Yeah.
236	00:21:07	00:21:09	So did Hank Connors.
237	00:21:09	00:21:10	See, it figures.
238	00:21:10	00:21:12	Cats are a natural enemy of reptiles.
239	00:21:12	00:21:15	I'll keep that in mind.
240	00:21:15	00:21:18	The sword I found at Shannon Turner's made the tool marks on the skull.
241	00:21:19	00:21:22	Shannon's prints were all over the handle.
242	00:21:22	00:21:25	And the partials on the blade, above the hilt-- Chyna De Vere's.
243	00:21:26	00:21:28	She tried to defend herself.
244	00:21:33	00:21:36	Did Wendy find anything on that drop of blood on the carpet?
245	00:21:37	00:21:38	Came back to Shannon.
246	00:21:38	00:21:41	Yeah, but Brass interviewed her last week.
247	00:21:41	00:21:42	She didn't have any visible cuts.
248	00:21:42	00:21:43	Warrick?
249	00:21:44	00:21:46	Come at me with a sword.
250	00:21:48	00:21:51	All right, so I push back hard enough...
251	00:21:51	00:21:53	bang you on the nose.
252	00:21:53	00:21:55	Brass wouldn't have seen that.
253	00:21:57	00:22:10	But what I don't understand is if Shannon Turner and Hank Connors really believed in a Reptilian conspiracy and they felt threatened by the political establishment, why kill a blackjack dealer?
254	00:22:22	00:22:23	Hey, Nick!
255	00:22:23	00:22:24	Yeah?
256	00:22:25	00:22:26	I got something over here.
257	00:22:40	00:22:42	Man, that looks human.
258	00:23:14	00:23:19	To Chyna, Love, Preston.
259	00:23:19	00:23:22	To Preston, Love, Chyna.
260	00:23:22	00:23:25	Till death do us part.
261	00:23:32	00:23:37	According to the Palermo, Shannon Turner joined the Player's Club last month.
262	00:23:37	00:23:47	Whenever a player uses a club card at a table game, the floor man writes down what game you played, where you sat, what time you started, time you quit.
263	00:23:47	00:23:49	Then they estimate your average bet, win-loss ratios...
264	00:23:49	00:23:52	No wonder she believed in conspiracies.
265	00:23:52	00:23:55	Well, this is the first time Shannon used her card.
266	00:23:55	00:23:58	And the dealer is Chyna.
267	00:24:00	00:24:01	A week later.
268	00:24:01	00:24:03	By now, she's a regular.
269	00:24:03	00:24:05	Looks like they're best friends.
270	00:24:06	00:24:08	(taps key, computer whirs) Two weeks ago.
271	00:24:08	00:24:10	Table's full.
272	00:24:10	00:24:12	She's waiting for a seat.
273	00:24:12	00:24:14	Shannon only gambled at Chyna's table.
274	00:24:14	00:24:17	Maybe Chyna was her lucky charm.
275	00:24:17	00:24:20	That depends on how you define luck.
276	00:24:22	00:24:25	She never walked away a winner.
277	00:24:25	00:24:28	Maybe she blamed Chyna for her losses.
278	00:24:28	00:24:31	She's too friendly.
279	00:24:31	00:24:33	I think she was gaining her trust.
280	00:24:33	00:24:35	Stalking her.
281	00:24:35	00:24:38	Well, it's Las Vegas.
282	00:24:38	00:24:40	It's not a crime to play blackjack.
283	00:24:40	00:24:41	You're right, it's Las Vegas.
284	00:24:41	00:24:44	But it is a crime to lie to the police.
285	00:24:45	00:24:47	We found your blood in Chyna's apartment.
286	00:24:47	00:24:50	Then it was planted.
287	00:24:50	00:24:51	By whom?
288	00:24:51	00:24:53	How should I know?
289	00:24:53	00:24:54	Maybe you planted it.
290	00:24:54	00:24:55	Look...
291	00:24:56	00:25:01	...you killed Chyna, and you got Connors to help you move the body.
292	00:25:02	00:25:06	And Connors killed Preston, because he was obsessed with you and wanted to eliminate the competition.
293	00:25:06	00:25:11	You lied about knowing Chyna, you going to lie about this, too?
294	00:25:11	00:25:14	Preston can't be killed.
295	00:25:14	00:25:15	His cells don't die.
296	00:25:15	00:25:17	He's over 4,000 years old.
297	00:25:17	00:25:19	Oh, 4,000.
298	00:25:19	00:25:21	The new 50.
299	00:25:22	00:25:25	You just don't know the truth when you hear it.
300	00:25:25	00:25:28	Preston is a great man.
301	00:25:28	00:25:30	He has the wisdom of the ages.
302	00:25:30	00:25:34	Beyond your capacity to understand.
303	00:25:34	00:25:36	Ms. Turner...
304	00:25:37	00:25:40	...was Chyna a Reptilian?
305	00:25:46	00:25:48	Who is this?
306	00:25:51	00:25:54	The Reptilian Athena.
307	00:25:54	00:25:57	Is that Chyna De Vere?
308	00:26:04	00:26:07	Tell me about this one.
309	00:26:10	00:26:12	That's the Protector of Mankind.
310	00:26:13	00:26:16	Is that you?
311	00:26:22	00:26:25	Hmm?
312	00:26:27	00:26:30	Did you slay the Reptilian Athena?
313	00:26:30	00:26:33	I did what I had to do.
314	00:26:35	00:26:37	I have to kill you.
315	00:26:37	00:26:38	What?!
316	00:26:42	00:26:45	It's not like there's nothing at stake here.
317	00:26:45	00:26:48	Just the survival of the human race.
318	00:26:48	00:26:54	Yeah, I'm just a phone booth away from changing into my tights and saving the world.
319	00:27:01	00:27:03	Hey, Warrick, I got something.
320	00:27:03	00:27:07	I was scanning the casino footage from the day Chyna disappeared.
321	00:27:07	00:27:10	And she had a visitor.
322	00:27:10	00:27:12	Her husband.
323	00:27:12	00:27:14	She doesn't look so happy to see him.
324	00:27:17	00:27:18	Well, we don't need words to get that.
325	00:27:18	00:27:19	Give me your ring.
326	00:27:19	00:27:21	I really, really hate you.
327	00:27:21	00:27:23	Our marriage is over.
328	00:27:23	00:27:27	Well, that means she was killed before she had a chance to change her clothes.
329	00:27:27	00:27:31	That would explain why we found both rings in the ashes.
330	00:27:31	00:27:34	But it doesn't explain what happened to him.
331	00:28:12	00:28:14	I found it embedded in this.
332	00:28:14	00:28:15	T-9 vertebra.
333	00:28:15	00:28:19	But that means the bullet had to pass through at least one vital organ.
334	00:28:19	00:28:21	Yeah, heart, lung, and then the dome of the liver.
335	00:28:21	00:28:23	That's your C.O.D.
336	00:28:23	00:28:25	And you're sure these are Chyna De Vere's bones.
337	00:28:25	00:28:26	Yeah, pelvis is female.
338	00:28:26	00:28:28	No duplicate bones.
339	00:28:28	00:28:31	The femur's the same length as the one the pigs were chomping on.
340	00:28:31	00:28:33	It's her.
341	00:28:33	00:28:36	Okay. Well, we'll run this against Connors' guns.
342	00:28:50	00:28:52	I always feel sorry for the monster.
343	00:28:52	00:28:57	Then you better turn it off before they use the Oxygen Destroyer on him.
344	00:29:00	00:29:02	Hey, Bruno, come on!
345	00:29:33	00:29:40	I don't know why I find it so difficult to express my feelings to you.
346	00:29:40	00:29:46	Even though we're far apart, I can see you as vividly as if you were here with me.
347	00:29:46	00:29:50	I said I'll miss you, and I do.
348	00:30:00	00:30:20	As Shakespeare more ably wrote my sentiment in Sonnet 47, Thyself away art present still with me; For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move, and I am still with them, and they with thee.
349	00:30:20	00:30:30	Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight awakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight.
350	00:30:32	00:30:34	Fire in the hole!
351	00:30:36	00:30:39	You're supposed to let me get these things on.
352	00:30:39	00:30:41	Hey, you were supposed to be ready.
353	00:30:43	00:30:44	I don't know, man.
354	00:30:44	00:30:48	Maybe it would have worked out if Tina was someone who did what we did.
355	00:30:51	00:30:54	At least she'd understand the hours.
356	00:30:54	00:30:55	Oh, I don't know.
357	00:30:55	00:30:58	I don't think it's a good idea to date somebody you work with.
358	00:30:58	00:31:03	You never really get away from work or them the way you need to, you know?
359	00:31:03	00:31:05	You mean, like me and you, baby?
360	00:31:05	00:31:08	Yeah, exactly, honey.
361	00:31:13	00:31:14	Mm-hmm.
362	00:31:14	00:31:21	Yeah, it looks like the bullet that killed her came from Connors' Walther PPK.
363	00:31:37	00:31:39	Captain Brass?
364	00:31:39	00:31:41	Jim.
365	00:31:41	00:31:42	Joe Vasquez.
366	00:31:42	00:31:44	How you doing, Joe?
367	00:31:44	00:31:46	I got a call from a passing motorist.
368	00:31:46	00:31:48	Naked guy running around in the desert.
369	00:31:48	00:31:52	That may not be so strange where you work, but out here, it gets our attention.
370	00:31:52	00:31:54	I recognized him from the news.
371	00:31:54	00:31:56	Thanks a lot, Joe.
372	00:32:01	00:32:03	Preston De Vere?
373	00:32:03	00:32:06	Very glad to be back home.
374	00:32:06	00:32:09	What are you doing out here, Preston?
375	00:32:09	00:32:12	I was a captive, held against my will.
376	00:32:14	00:32:17	From what the Sheriff tells me, I've been gone over a week.
377	00:32:18	00:32:20	Feels like just seconds.
378	00:32:20	00:32:23	Can you describe these people to me?
379	00:32:23	00:32:27	Well, yes, but you won't believe me.
380	00:32:27	00:32:29	Try me.
381	00:32:32	00:32:34	They were very tall...
382	00:32:34	00:32:40	with Reptilian features; large, almond-shaped, red eyes.
383	00:32:43	00:32:46	Hey, what's happening, Lizard King?
384	00:32:46	00:32:48	I appreciate your skepticism.
385	00:32:48	00:32:50	I anticipated it.
386	00:32:52	00:32:55	Insight begins with asking the right questions.
387	00:32:55	00:33:00	Okay, then, when exactly were you abducted?
388	00:33:05	00:33:06	Nine days ago.
389	00:33:07	00:33:10	Oh, so you were abducted before your wife was missing.
390	00:33:10	00:33:11	What do you mean Chyna is missing?
391	00:33:11	00:33:12	What happened to her?
392	00:33:12	00:33:14	What are you trying to tell me?
393	00:33:14	00:33:16	You don't know your wife is dead?
394	00:33:16	00:33:18	That was callous of you.
395	00:33:19	00:33:21	Unnecessarily cruel.
396	00:33:21	00:33:23	I had no idea.
397	00:33:27	00:33:29	That sweet girl...
398	00:33:29	00:33:31	Stop the crocodile tears.
399	00:33:31	00:33:32	Come on.
400	00:33:32	00:33:33	Preston.
401	00:33:33	00:33:38	If she was so sweet, what were you doing chillin' in Cabo with Shannon Turner?
402	00:33:38	00:33:41	Are you suggesting that was romantic?
403	00:33:41	00:33:42	Well, you got your pictures on the coffee mug.
404	00:33:42	00:33:44	That's romantic to me.
405	00:33:44	00:33:50	You better come up with an alibi-- on planet Earth-- of where you were the night your wife was killed.
406	00:33:52	00:33:54	That's easy.
407	00:33:59	00:34:03	There's a woman, and it is romantic, very romantic.
408	00:34:05	00:34:08	I was with her when they took me.
409	00:34:08	00:34:10	Her name is Clarissa Niles.
410	00:34:11	00:34:13	We are victims...
411	00:34:14	00:34:16	...and no one is listening to us.
412	00:34:16	00:34:20	We're powerless against what's going on.
413	00:34:20	00:34:21	We're not crazy.
414	00:34:21	00:34:28	If you look at who has had contact, we're airline pilots, professionals, teachers, scientists.
415	00:34:28	00:34:32	I don't know how to get the truth out, but we have to.
416	00:34:34	00:34:38	Has anyone talked to Shannon in the last couple of days?
417	00:34:42	00:34:44	They've got her.
418	00:34:44	00:34:47	It's like we're witnessing some form of mass hallucination.
419	00:34:47	00:34:52	You know, they think the cops are part of this Reptilian conspiracy as well.
420	00:34:52	00:34:54	That's why Shannon attacked Greg.
421	00:35:01	00:35:04	And why Hank Connors shot himself.
422	00:35:16	00:35:17	Sorry to interrupt.
423	00:35:17	00:35:19	Don't make eye contact with them.
424	00:35:20	00:35:23	Please, we come in peace.
425	00:35:25	00:35:28	Which one of you is Clarissa Niles?
426	00:35:28	00:35:31	Don't.
427	00:35:32	00:35:33	It's all right.
428	00:35:33	00:35:35	I'm not afraid.
429	00:35:35	00:35:38	Got a warrant to tow in Clarissa Niles' car.
430	00:35:38	00:35:41	Blue fluorescence is one of the properties of scheelite.
431	00:35:41	00:35:44	Which was found in the soil at Hank Connors' ranch.
432	00:35:44	00:35:47	And Preston beamed down in the same area.
433	00:35:47	00:35:49	Have you looked inside yet?
434	00:35:49	00:35:51	I was just about to.
435	00:35:54	00:35:57	Preston was found naked, right?
436	00:35:57	00:36:00	Yeah, it's a recurrent theme in tales of alien abduction.
437	00:36:00	00:36:02	I practically grew up on The X-Files.
438	00:36:02	00:36:05	Preston's wallet.
439	00:36:06	00:36:10	Somehow I doubt aliens would have folded his clothes when they abducted him.
440	00:36:12	00:36:16	So Clarissa drove him out there and he left his stuff in her car.
441	00:36:18	00:36:20	That's not all he left.
442	00:36:21	00:36:22	Steam cleaner.
443	00:36:22	00:36:27	Just what every estranged husband needs to clean up his dead wife's blood.
444	00:36:27	00:36:30	This case just came down to Earth.
445	00:36:30	00:36:35	Yes, Preston was at my home in Summerlin.
446	00:36:35	00:36:39	We were asleep and suddenly the room turned very cold.
447	00:36:39	00:36:41	Freezing.
448	00:36:41	00:36:45	I woke up and looked over and Preston was gone.
449	00:36:45	00:36:49	I... I searched the house, outside...
450	00:36:49	00:36:52	It was as if he evaporated.
451	00:36:53	00:36:55	Come on, Clarissa, you're a smart woman, I mean, really.
452	00:36:55	00:37:00	I mean, you have a beautiful home, you're a good citizen, you pay your taxes, you vote, you even play a little golf.
453	00:37:00	00:37:03	You got way too much on the ball to fall for this con man.
454	00:37:03	00:37:05	Con man?
455	00:37:06	00:37:08	You think I'm gullible?
456	00:37:09	00:37:11	He's a brilliant man.
457	00:37:11	00:37:14	He saved my life.
458	00:37:14	00:37:16	When we first met, I was very ill.
459	00:37:16	00:37:19	It was cancer and he cured it.
460	00:37:19	00:37:21	Really?
461	00:37:21	00:37:22	How'd he do that?
462	00:37:22	00:37:27	He knows how to prevent human cells from dying.
463	00:37:27	00:37:32	He has injections; they're, they're radioactive.
464	00:37:32	00:37:35	Hospitals won't do it because it would make everyone well.
465	00:37:35	00:37:36	It would put them out of business.
466	00:37:38	00:37:41	Do you really think he's 4,000 years old?
467	00:37:41	00:37:44	Here.
468	00:37:45	00:37:47	Let me show you something.
469	00:37:47	00:37:50	Look at this.
470	00:37:50	00:37:53	He's 42.
471	00:37:53	00:37:55	He claims he's a nutritionist.
472	00:37:55	00:37:56	He's not.
473	00:37:56	00:37:57	And look.
474	00:37:57	00:38:00	Look at all these schools and labs he said he went to.
475	00:38:00	00:38:02	They never heard of him.
476	00:38:03	00:38:05	He has no place of business, no job.
477	00:38:05	00:38:08	He just preys on vulnerable women.
478	00:38:08	00:38:11	He got Shannon Turner to kill his wife for him.
479	00:38:11	00:38:14	Got you to give him money.
480	00:38:14	00:38:15	He never asked for it.
481	00:38:15	00:38:17	I wanted to give it to him.
482	00:38:17	00:38:20	You would have done anything for him, whether he asked for it or not.
483	00:38:20	00:38:23	Do you have any idea how beautiful you are?
484	00:38:24	00:38:27	I mean really, really, really beautiful.
485	00:38:27	00:38:28	More so every day.
486	00:38:29	00:38:30	That's because you cured me.
487	00:38:30	00:38:34	I-I-I've never felt better or happier.
488	00:38:35	00:38:39	You know, I didn't want to alarm you, but they put an implant in you.
489	00:38:40	00:38:43	They do it while you're sleeping so they can manipulate your thoughts.
490	00:38:43	00:38:45	My injections disabled it.
491	00:38:46	00:38:49	You're not only cancer-free, you're free of their control.
492	00:38:49	00:38:50	Oh, my God.
493	00:38:50	00:38:53	How am I ever going to be able to thank you?
494	00:38:53	00:39:00	You drove him out to McCade, you dropped him off, you brought back his clothes.
495	00:39:00	00:39:02	The evidence is all over your car.
496	00:39:06	00:39:08	He loved me.
497	00:39:08	00:39:12	He used you just like he used everybody.
498	00:40:08	00:40:12	If they were trying to clean up all the blood, they did a good job.
499	00:40:12	00:40:14	Steam cleaner tested positive for blood, but there wasn't enough for DNA.
500	00:40:15	00:40:16	Did you find anything?
501	00:40:16	00:40:17	Funny you should ask.
502	00:40:17	00:40:18	Found a hair in the brushes. Oh.
503	00:40:18	00:40:21	It's on the left.
504	00:40:21	00:40:24	The one on the right is Chyna De Vere's.
505	00:40:24	00:40:26	They're both Chyna's.
506	00:40:26	00:40:28	Hey.
507	00:40:28	00:40:31	That steam cleaner was completely wiped down, couldn't find any prints.
508	00:40:31	00:40:35	But then I remembered this story about a CSI down in L.A.
509	00:40:35	00:40:41	Nobody could find any prints on a gas can from an arson, but he realized that you got to grip it underneath in order to pour out the gas.
510	00:40:41	00:40:43	And you know what?
511	00:40:43	00:40:45	He broke the case.
512	00:40:45	00:40:48	So whose prints are on the steam cleaner?
513	00:40:49	00:40:51	Preston De Vere.
514	00:40:53	00:40:56	You have a destiny.
515	00:40:56	00:40:58	You were chosen.
516	00:40:58	00:41:00	You are a Protector of Mankind.
517	00:41:00	00:41:02	Have no fear.
518	00:41:03	00:41:05	Cut off her tail, she lives.
519	00:41:05	00:41:07	Cut off her head, she dies.
520	00:41:07	00:41:10	No problem.
521	00:41:18	00:41:22	It wasn't a Reptilian conspiracy, but it was a conspiracy.
522	00:41:22	00:41:26	Men are snakes.
523	00:41:26	00:41:29	So we checked Chyna's bank account.
524	00:41:29	00:41:32	She had a tidy little inheritance until she met you.
525	00:41:32	00:41:35	Chyna was sucking the life out of me.
526	00:41:35	00:41:39	She deserved none of what she wanted and all of what she got in the end.
527	00:41:39	00:41:42	I'm glad it took a long time for her to die.
528	00:41:42	00:41:45	I can only imagine the pain.
529	00:41:45	00:41:52	You know, every time I think about leaving this job, a guy like you comes along and reminds me why I can't.
530	00:42:05	00:42:10	History is replete with stories of the heroic destruction of serpents.
531	00:42:10	00:42:18	Perseus and Medusa, St. George and the Dragon, St. Patrick and the Snakes of Ireland.
532	00:42:19	00:42:21	These are not merely legends.
533	00:42:21	00:42:36	These are accounts of battles for the survival of the human race-- a battle we will lose unless we stop killing one another and focus on the real enemies.
534	00:42:36	00:42:39	They are among us.
