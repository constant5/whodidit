0	00:00:17	00:00:18	What are you doing?
1	00:00:20	00:00:22	I'm going insane.
2	00:00:22	00:00:24	I don't understand this diagram.
3	00:00:26	00:00:29	You don't need a diagram.
4	00:00:29	00:00:31	You need a woman.
5	00:00:37	00:00:41	I'm looking forward to your speech.
6	00:00:49	00:00:55	What A.D. Cavallo will enjoy the most is no longer having to lie about how much work he has to do.
7	00:00:58	00:01:00	Enjoy your retirement, Bob.
8	00:01:01	00:01:03	But seriously, folks...
9	00:01:04	00:01:12	appointing the new Assistant Director for the Crime Lab is not a task I take lightly. I believe in promoting from within.
10	00:01:12	00:01:17	I believe in rewarding years of dedication and devotion to this Department.
11	00:01:17	00:01:19	I believe in Conrad Ecklie.
12	00:01:28	00:01:33	For a proper introduction, I'd like to turn to his good friend... ( pager ringing )
13	00:01:33	00:01:35	...Supervisor Gil Grissom.
14	00:01:38	00:01:39	Gil...
15	00:01:39	00:01:41	I got a 419.
16	00:01:42	00:01:43	Don't even think about it.
17	00:01:43	00:01:44	Swing's tapped out.
18	00:01:44	00:01:45	I'm the back-up.
19	00:01:47	00:01:48	Here...
20	00:01:48	00:01:50	you give my speech.
21	00:01:51	00:01:53	Good luck, Conrad.
22	00:01:56	00:01:58	Gil...
23	00:02:05	00:02:06	What's going on?
24	00:02:21	00:02:22	Hey, Griss...
25	00:02:22	00:02:23	What's with the monkey suit?
26	00:02:23	00:02:26	I was at a funeral across the street.
27	00:02:26	00:02:28	At a casino?
28	00:02:28	00:02:29	My condolences.
29	00:02:29	00:02:31	Scene's in the east penthouse.
30	00:02:31	00:02:33	Gotta use the VIP elevator.
31	00:02:33	00:02:34	Thanks.
32	00:02:43	00:02:44	Hey.
33	00:02:44	00:02:46	Hello.
34	00:02:49	00:02:51	What floor did you want?
35	00:02:51	00:02:53	Where do you think I'm going?
36	00:02:53	00:02:56	I wouldn't know.
37	00:02:56	00:02:58	You don't recognize me.
38	00:02:59	00:03:00	Apparently not.
39	00:03:00	00:03:04	In the lab, I usually wear my hair up.
40	00:03:05	00:03:07	Oh, yeah...
41	00:03:07	00:03:10	You're pulling in when I'm pulling out.
42	00:03:10	00:03:11	Sofia Curtis.
43	00:03:11	00:03:12	CSI-Three, day shift.
44	00:03:12	00:03:13	You work for Ecklie.
45	00:03:13	00:03:16	As of tonight, so do you.
46	00:03:20	00:03:23	Hey, Gil... hey, Sofie.
47	00:03:23	00:03:25	Sorry to drag you away from the Chicken Cordon Bleu.
48	00:03:25	00:03:29	It's the McKinley High Homecoming.
49	00:03:29	00:03:35	The dance is downstairs, but the cool kids' party is in here.
50	00:03:40	00:03:44	This place makes the Rain Man suite at Caesar's look like my condo.
51	00:03:45	00:03:47	These rooms are just for whales and royalty.
52	00:03:47	00:03:48	What's up?
53	00:03:48	00:03:52	We're running down the VIP host, see who's got it tonight.
54	00:03:52	00:03:56	Okay, paramedics pronounced, left the scene undisturbed.
55	00:03:56	00:03:59	Name is Nicole Jensen, 17.
56	00:03:59	00:04:01	Coroner's en route.
57	00:04:01	00:04:03	I'm gonna talk to the MTV generation.
58	00:04:09	00:04:11	Where's your kit?
59	00:04:11	00:04:13	I can send a uniform to bring it up.
60	00:04:20	00:04:24	Teenager abuses drugs and/or booze...
61	00:04:24	00:04:26	there's a news flash.
62	00:04:32	00:04:34	Contusions on her neck.
63	00:04:34	00:04:38	And the position suggests she was grabbed from behind.
64	00:04:40	00:04:42	A night to remember.
65	00:04:44	00:04:46	A night to forget.
66	00:05:28	00:05:31	Okay... so I talked to the VIP host.
67	00:05:31	00:05:34	The room was checked out to Charlie Macklin.
68	00:05:34	00:05:35	It's his casino.
69	00:05:35	00:05:37	Yeah, it's for his daughter, Janelle.
70	00:05:37	00:05:40	She's having an after party with her and her friends.
71	00:05:40	00:05:42	Oh, off the streets and out of trouble.
72	00:05:42	00:05:44	Best laid plans.
73	00:05:44	00:05:47	So what's the daughter's story?
74	00:05:47	00:05:49	You know, I don't know.
75	00:05:49	00:05:50	We haven't seen her yet.
76	00:05:50	00:05:51	We're still looking.
77	00:06:08	00:06:13	I can barely move in this dress and we haven't cleared the bathroom yet, so there it is.
78	00:06:13	00:06:16	Don't worry, I'm wearing underwear.
79	00:06:16	00:06:18	As far as you know.
80	00:06:21	00:06:24	Liver temp is 97.2.
81	00:06:24	00:06:26	She's been dead less than two hours.
82	00:06:26	00:06:28	Banana peel...
83	00:06:28	00:06:30	G-string...
84	00:06:31	00:06:32	Scared of that.
85	00:06:35	00:06:37	Ligature marks on both of her wrists.
86	00:06:40	00:06:41	Some kind of adhesive residue, too.
87	00:06:47	00:06:50	So, she was bound?
88	00:06:53	00:06:55	Marked impression on her left cheek.
89	00:06:58	00:07:03	Maybe some sort of circular device pressed against her face?
90	00:07:08	00:07:10	No beer or liquor.
91	00:07:10	00:07:14	Just water, yogurt, and OJ.
92	00:07:15	00:07:19	Mixers, not for drinks... maybe for drugs.
93	00:07:19	00:07:23	Right pH in the stomach speeds the buzz.
94	00:07:23	00:07:25	I think there's narco around here somewhere.
95	00:07:25	00:07:28	A-A-Are you talking to me?
96	00:07:28	00:07:30	No.
97	00:07:30	00:07:33	Do you always process like this?
98	00:07:33	00:07:35	Like what?
99	00:07:35	00:07:36	With your mouth.
100	00:07:36	00:07:42	Whenever I meet someone new, I always say their name out loud a few times.
101	00:07:42	00:07:43	Keeps a picture in my head.
102	00:07:43	00:07:45	Hm...
103	00:07:45	00:07:47	I thought that's why we had cameras.
104	00:07:49	00:07:53	So, Nikki comes running in and starts laughing at the carpet.
105	00:07:53	00:07:56	You know, hurling, blowing chunks, vomiting.
106	00:07:56	00:07:58	I got it, Miranda.
107	00:07:58	00:07:59	I get the picture.
108	00:07:59	00:08:00	I know what it means.
109	00:08:00	00:08:04	The others came in, and, uh...
110	00:08:04	00:08:06	Someone tried CPR, I guess.
111	00:08:06	00:08:08	Didn't work. We called 911.
112	00:08:08	00:08:10	So, uh, you tight with Nikki?
113	00:08:10	00:08:11	God, no.
114	00:08:11	00:08:13	Her dad was a freelance limo driver.
115	00:08:13	00:08:16	I mean, you have to have a felony to get that job.
116	00:08:16	00:08:19	How would you know that?
117	00:08:19	00:08:21	Everybody knows that.
118	00:08:21	00:08:24	The guy was an ex-kneebreaker for the old mob.
119	00:08:24	00:08:25	You ever see Casino? The movie?
120	00:08:25	00:08:27	Yeah, sure, yeah.
121	00:08:27	00:08:29	Whatever. The guy Joe Pesci played.
122	00:08:29	00:08:30	Tony The Ant Spilotro.
123	00:08:30	00:08:32	Well, he and Nikki's dad were friends.
124	00:08:32	00:08:33	Oh, yeah?
125	00:08:33	00:08:35	In real life.
126	00:08:35	00:08:37	Real lowlifes.
127	00:08:37	00:08:40	That girl was Kryptonite to me.
128	00:08:40	00:08:43	I'd be lying if I said any different.
129	00:08:43	00:08:49	Kids have been going in and out of the suite all night, but the front desk only issued card keys to seven.
130	00:08:49	00:08:51	Brass has five of them upstairs...
131	00:08:51	00:08:57	uh, Janelle Macklin and Sean Paland are unaccounted for, so I'll check the casino.
132	00:08:57	00:09:00	I thought you were going to process the scene with Grissom.
133	00:09:00	00:09:02	I was. He said he had it covered.
134	00:09:02	00:09:04	Sofia Curtis is up there with him.
135	00:09:04	00:09:07	Right... Ecklie's right hand.
136	00:09:07	00:09:08	Ever do a case with her?
137	00:09:08	00:09:09	Uh-uh.
138	00:09:09	00:09:11	Hey, I heard Grissom stuck you with his speech.
139	00:09:11	00:09:15	A napkin is not a speech.
140	00:09:15	00:09:23	I'm going to need to see everybody who went in or out of the east penthouse since check-in, and that includes stairwells and service entrances.
141	00:09:23	00:09:26	You know, that's Janelle Macklin's suite.
142	00:09:26	00:09:28	Yeah, I know.
143	00:09:28	00:09:30	Her father owns the casino.
144	00:09:30	00:09:33	Okay...
145	00:09:35	00:09:38	Dance is still going strong.
146	00:09:38	00:09:41	That's the beauty of high school in Las Vegas.
147	00:09:41	00:09:46	Homecoming in a casino, dance can go all night.
148	00:09:50	00:09:52	I've been down here dancing for hours.
149	00:09:52	00:09:53	Ask anybody.
150	00:09:53	00:09:56	Why don't you come over here and talk to me for a second?
151	00:09:56	00:09:57	Come on, man!
152	00:09:57	00:09:58	What, you need to tell your date?
153	00:09:58	00:10:00	I came stag. Come here.
154	00:10:00	00:10:02	If I want a date, I'll get one in there.
155	00:10:02	00:10:05	You know how many couples break up at Homecoming?
156	00:10:05	00:10:06	I looked it up.
157	00:10:06	00:10:08	It's like ten percent. Staggering.
158	00:10:08	00:10:10	Hm... you hang out with Nikki a lot?
159	00:10:10	00:10:13	Please-- the girl's a scarf.
160	00:10:13	00:10:16	Always hanging on the neck of anyone with loot.
161	00:10:16	00:10:20	Is that what was she doing up in the P. Diddy suite with your buddies?
162	00:10:20	00:10:23	Guess everybody wanted in on that party.
163	00:10:23	00:10:26	And Nikki wasn't on the list.
164	00:10:26	00:10:27	Hey, wait, Janelle...
165	00:10:27	00:10:28	Janelle, wait!
166	00:10:28	00:10:29	Look, Nikki, it's no big deal.
167	00:10:29	00:10:30	You're not missing anything.
168	00:10:30	00:10:32	That's easy for you to say.
169	00:10:32	00:10:33	C'mon, Janelle, we're seniors.
170	00:10:33	00:10:35	This is my last homecoming-- please!
171	00:10:35	00:10:37	Janelle's always taking in strays.
172	00:10:37	00:10:39	Yeah, Janelle...
173	00:10:39	00:10:40	Do you know where Janelle is now?
174	00:10:40	00:10:42	I have no idea.
175	00:10:42	00:10:46	You know, when I busted outta there, she was still up there chillin' with the rest of them.
176	00:10:46	00:10:49	Standard SAE kit was collected.
177	00:10:49	00:10:51	Physical finding of sexual activity.
178	00:10:51	00:10:54	Unable to determine if consensual or rape.
179	00:10:54	00:10:56	Collected heart blood sample.
180	00:10:56	00:11:03	Preliminary tox indicates psilocybin, MDMA, and THC in the system.
181	00:11:03	00:11:07	Green-colored fiber was collected from the nasal passages...
182	00:11:07	00:11:12	to be forwarded to Trace Evidence for analysis.
183	00:11:12	00:11:18	Vomitus mass was found in the throat and lungs and there was petecchial hemorrhaging of the lower eyelids.
184	00:11:18	00:11:27	Preliminary C.O.D. appears to be mechanical asphyxia from aspiration of gastric content as a result of acute drug intoxication.
185	00:11:30	00:11:37	Albert Robbins, M.E., employee number 228369.
186	00:11:51	00:11:57	Collected seven used condoms from two bedrooms-- not a record in my book.
187	00:11:57	00:12:02	Fact that the victim's wrists were bound suggests possible sex games.
188	00:12:02	00:12:10	Also pulled a plastic Baggie from a toilet containing what looks like ground-up mushrooms, probably not the kind you put on pizza.
189	00:12:10	00:12:13	Could be the source of the psilocybin.
190	00:12:13	00:12:15	One of those kids is still holding.
191	00:12:15	00:12:16	I'm gonna let Brass know.
192	00:12:19	00:12:22	That time I was talking to you.
193	00:12:22	00:12:23	What?
194	00:12:24	00:12:25	Sorry.
195	00:12:25	00:12:29	I was, uh, treating it like white noise.
196	00:12:31	00:12:32	What are you seeing?
197	00:12:32	00:12:34	Chicken Cordon Bleu.
198	00:12:34	00:12:44	Okay, there's no evidence of that meal anywhere here, and Ecklie always said you had an odd sense of humor, so that would make this a joke.
199	00:12:46	00:12:47	Not really.
200	00:12:47	00:12:51	If you're on your feet when you're throwing up, the vomit goes everywhere.
201	00:12:51	00:12:54	The higher you are, the wider the splash, right?
202	00:12:54	00:12:57	But...
203	00:12:57	00:12:59	this vomit is confined to one specific area.
204	00:13:01	00:13:05	So she was probably lying down when she was throwing up.
205	00:13:05	00:13:06	Maybe unconscious.
206	00:13:07	00:13:08	Or already dead.
207	00:13:08	00:13:11	Vomit could've been forced out by CPR compressions.
208	00:13:11	00:13:13	But that doesn't explain the bruise on her cheek.
209	00:13:13	00:13:15	Or the green fibers in her nose.
210	00:13:32	00:13:34	Well...
211	00:13:34	00:13:35	may have started here.
212	00:13:37	00:13:40	Stop it! Stop it!
213	00:13:49	00:13:51	Come on, you're all done-- let's go.
214	00:13:51	00:13:52	What do you mean?
215	00:13:52	00:13:53	We know you're dealing drugs.
216	00:13:53	00:13:54	Nikki Jensen's dead because of you.
217	00:13:54	00:13:57	No, okay, wait, okay, I don't even do... I don't even drink, okay?
218	00:13:57	00:14:02	You don't... you don't want me, you... you want Rex.
219	00:14:03	00:14:05	Hey, Rex.
220	00:14:07	00:14:09	Look, my name is Gavin.
221	00:14:09	00:14:10	You got my license, check it.
222	00:14:10	00:14:14	No, no, it's Rex, you know, as in RX.
223	00:14:14	00:14:16	I guess it's a lot more subtle than drugstore, right?
224	00:14:17	00:14:19	I got nothing to do with drugs, my man.
225	00:14:19	00:14:20	You already searched me.
226	00:14:20	00:14:22	Is there anywhere else you care to look?
227	00:14:22	00:14:25	Hey, you better save that position for later, brother.
228	00:14:25	00:14:27	You're gonna need it, where you're going.
229	00:14:27	00:14:28	Is this our dealer?
230	00:14:28	00:14:29	Oh, yeah.
231	00:14:29	00:14:32	Get this straight, okay? I'm not a drug dealer.
232	00:14:32	00:14:36	My dad owns seven restaurants, including one at the Bellagio and the gourmet room downstairs.
233	00:14:36	00:14:37	I don't need drug money.
234	00:14:38	00:14:40	Well, maybe you just like getting your friends high.
235	00:14:40	00:14:43	There's a song about that, I think.
236	00:14:57	00:14:58	Hold out your hand.
237	00:15:01	00:15:02	Duct tape residue.
238	00:15:02	00:15:04	What do you know?
239	00:15:06	00:15:14	You know, if the water is relatively still, submerged prints can remain for weeks, months, sometimes even years.
240	00:15:22	00:15:24	Thank you.
241	00:15:24	00:15:28	When we match your prints on this bag, you'll be charged with murder.
242	00:15:47	00:15:49	I didn't give Nikki anything.
243	00:15:49	00:15:51	The 'shrooms were for the room.
244	00:15:51	00:15:54	She was diving in there with both hands, and...
245	00:15:54	00:15:55	Did you have sex with her?
246	00:15:55	00:15:56	So what if I did?
247	00:15:56	00:15:59	She was... giving it away.
248	00:15:59	00:16:02	You tied her up and forced her down on the couch.
249	00:16:02	00:16:04	That wasn't me.
250	00:16:09	00:16:11	Grissom.
251	00:16:11	00:16:13	I just found Janelle Macklin.
252	00:16:13	00:16:15	Good. We need to talk to her right away.
253	00:16:15	00:16:17	That's going to be tough.
254	00:16:30	00:16:32	Everybody hit the floor! Now! Now!
255	00:16:32	00:16:33	Now! Now!
256	00:16:37	00:16:39	They had duct tape.
257	00:16:39	00:16:44	They tied everyone up, and they dragged Janelle out.
258	00:16:44	00:16:46	So how did Nikki end up dead?
259	00:16:48	00:16:50	Um...
260	00:16:50	00:16:52	eventually, we all...
261	00:16:52	00:16:54	got ourselves free.
262	00:16:54	00:16:58	Everybody was scared, but Nikki was possessed.
263	00:16:58	00:17:01	She was wasted. Freaking out.
264	00:17:01	00:17:03	No! I'm leaving! Shut up!
265	00:17:03	00:17:05	Shut up! Shut her up!
266	00:17:05	00:17:06	Friggin' 'shrooms!
267	00:17:06	00:17:08	Chill, will ya?!
268	00:17:12	00:17:15	We weren't trying to hurt her.
269	00:17:15	00:17:17	Well, that's for the DA to decide.
270	00:17:19	00:17:21	Why try to hide the kidnapping?
271	00:17:21	00:17:23	I told the kids not to report it.
272	00:17:23	00:17:26	And I told 'em not to leave the room.
273	00:17:26	00:17:28	They were smart enough to listen.
274	00:17:28	00:17:30	Janelle's fine. It's a game.
275	00:17:30	00:17:33	You know, Mr. Macklin, based on the surveillance videotape...
276	00:17:33	00:17:35	I've seen it.
277	00:17:35	00:17:37	Your daughter looked terrified.
278	00:17:37	00:17:39	She does school plays.
279	00:17:39	00:17:41	Says she wants to be an actor.
280	00:17:41	00:17:43	At least that's the story this month.
281	00:17:43	00:17:45	So you think this is all an act?
282	00:17:45	00:17:47	Daddy's little girl begging for attention.
283	00:17:47	00:17:49	Right on the button.
284	00:17:52	00:17:55	I sent her to a nice prep school back east, she flunked out on purpose.
285	00:17:56	00:17:59	I gave her a Bentley for her sweet 16, she wraps it around a tree.
286	00:17:59	00:18:02	I've been putting up with this crap since she was a kid.
287	00:18:02	00:18:03	I'm done.
288	00:18:03	00:18:06	When was the last time you actually talked to your daughter?
289	00:18:06	00:18:08	Yesterday, when she asked me to comp the suite.
290	00:18:10	00:18:13	You want me to call her, fine.
291	00:18:13	00:18:16	She never goes anywhere without her cell phone.
292	00:18:19	00:18:20	We have Janelle.
293	00:18:20	00:18:29	Wire one million U.S. dollars to Grand Caymans National Bank, account number 489-27-63.
294	00:18:29	00:18:33	If the money is not deposited within 24 hours, she dies.
295	00:18:35	00:18:37	I take it that's not her usual greeting.
296	00:18:39	00:18:41	If this is a game, why ask for money?
297	00:18:41	00:18:43	She obviously doesn't need it.
298	00:18:43	00:18:46	I pay, she wins.
299	00:18:46	00:18:49	You want to know why the abductors want the money wired to the Caymans?
300	00:18:49	00:18:50	Smart move.
301	00:18:50	00:18:53	Most kidnappers do get busted at the drop.
302	00:18:53	00:18:55	That's where Janelle has her trust is set up.
303	00:18:55	00:18:57	She knows how those banks work.
304	00:18:57	00:19:00	When Steve Wynn's daughter was kidnapped, he didn't tell the police.
305	00:19:00	00:19:06	He went to the Mirage casino floor, he got 1.4 million in cash, he made the drop...
306	00:19:06	00:19:08	Got his daughter back in a couple hours.
307	00:19:08	00:19:10	Yeah, I know the story.
308	00:19:10	00:19:12	Steve Wynn's daughter was a real victim.
309	00:19:12	00:19:14	Janelle isn't.
310	00:19:14	00:19:19	Game or not, Mr. Macklin, one girl is dead your daughter is missing.
311	00:19:19	00:19:20	We're compelled to investigate here.
312	00:19:20	00:19:22	You do that.
313	00:19:22	00:19:27	And when Janelle turns up, crying, saying how sorry she is, you make sure she answers for it.
314	00:19:45	00:19:49	Mr. Jensen, your daughter's personal effects are at the front desk.
315	00:20:03	00:20:06	Least you got your money's worth out of the rental.
316	00:20:09	00:20:13	I just wanted to let you know, no hard feelings about you leaving the banquet.
317	00:20:13	00:20:15	You're just... doing your job.
318	00:20:18	00:20:22	Have you decided yet who's going to be the day shift supervisor?
319	00:20:25	00:20:28	Well, Sofia's a logical choice, but nothing's official yet.
320	00:20:28	00:20:31	You should consider Catherine. She's earned it.
321	00:20:31	00:20:33	I'll, uh, I'll give it some thought.
322	00:20:35	00:20:37	Oh, you know...
323	00:20:37	00:20:39	I'd love to get a copy of your speech.
324	00:20:39	00:20:44	Just a little souvenir for my scrapbook.
325	00:20:44	00:20:46	I'll get you a copy.
326	00:20:46	00:20:47	That'd be great.
327	00:20:51	00:20:53	Tell me something.
328	00:20:53	00:20:55	I think my eyes need Band-Aids.
329	00:20:56	00:20:58	Tough shift.
330	00:20:58	00:21:00	You did say shift, right?
331	00:21:01	00:21:07	I reviewed roughly eight hours of video surveillance you so generously provided.
332	00:21:07	00:21:13	Janelle Macklin and several friends rode the VIP elevator 00 p.m.
333	00:21:13	00:21:16	The only other time Janelle set foot in the elevator...
334	00:21:16	00:21:17	she was a ransom note.
335	00:21:21	00:21:24	Well, we know they didn't take the VIP elevator down...
336	00:21:25	00:21:30	And, based on the video, they didn't use the stairs or the service elevator, either.
337	00:21:30	00:21:32	Maybe's she's still in the suite.
338	00:21:33	00:21:35	It's a big room.
339	00:21:41	00:21:45	Man, there must be over a hundred shoeprints in here.
340	00:21:45	00:21:47	Even more fingerprints on those buttons.
341	00:21:47	00:21:49	Good luck.
342	00:21:50	00:21:52	Thanks a lot.
343	00:21:53	00:21:55	How's it going?
344	00:21:55	00:21:56	Great.
345	00:21:56	00:21:58	Got all the towels we need here.
346	00:21:58	00:22:00	Yeah...
347	00:22:00	00:22:02	I might stick a few of those in my trunk.
348	00:22:05	00:22:08	The same costumes as the kidnappers.
349	00:22:11	00:22:14	These guys definitely knew their way around this hotel.
350	00:22:14	00:22:16	Yeah.
351	00:22:59	00:23:01	Hey, Catherine...
352	00:23:06	00:23:09	...got everything we need for Halloween except the candy.
353	00:23:11	00:23:15	The abductors exposed their faces to Janelle Macklin.
354	00:23:15	00:23:21	That's one of two things-- either she knew them, or they were going to whack her.
355	00:23:46	00:23:50	Look, I don't know why you had to drag me down here on my day off.
356	00:24:16	00:24:18	What's this, Kenny?
357	00:24:18	00:24:20	I don't know.
358	00:24:20	00:24:23	Sure you do.
359	00:24:24	00:24:26	A digital video time-delay.
360	00:24:26	00:24:30	TiVo-ing the casino.
361	00:24:30	00:24:33	Now that's ballsy.
362	00:24:35	00:24:46	You time-shifted the signal from the west penthouse service elevator and you fed it to the east monitor.
363	00:24:56	00:24:58	You were in on it.
364	00:24:58	00:25:01	Janelle asked me to do her a favor.
365	00:25:01	00:25:03	I really like her.
366	00:25:03	00:25:08	You know, I practically watched her grow up, I mean, through the...
367	00:25:08	00:25:10	cameras.
368	00:25:12	00:25:14	I'm so fired.
369	00:25:14	00:25:16	I screwed with Charlie Macklin.
370	00:25:16	00:25:18	I'm probably dead.
371	00:25:18	00:25:19	Where is she?
372	00:25:19	00:25:21	I don't know.
373	00:25:21	00:25:28	She said she wanted to sneak some guys up to her suite that Mr. Macklin wouldn't like.
374	00:25:28	00:25:29	What was I supposed to do?
375	00:25:29	00:25:30	I mean, she's the boss' daughter.
376	00:25:30	00:25:33	She's also a person of interest in the death of Nicole Jensen.
377	00:25:33	00:25:35	If you know anything...
378	00:25:35	00:25:38	I'm telling you, I don't know where she is.
379	00:25:48	00:25:52	Definitely not synthetic.
380	00:25:52	00:25:56	Medulla is 14 microns in diameter.
381	00:25:56	00:25:58	Continuous cortex.
382	00:25:58	00:26:01	Imbricate scales.
383	00:26:03	00:26:05	I'm thinking sheep.
384	00:26:17	00:26:18	Merino.
385	00:26:18	00:26:21	Fine wool for fine fabrics.
386	00:26:21	00:26:23	Why are you talking to yourself?
387	00:26:24	00:26:26	I'm trying a new technique.
388	00:26:26	00:26:27	Is it working?
389	00:26:27	00:26:28	I have no idea.
390	00:26:34	00:26:37	Aniline dye.
391	00:26:37	00:26:40	Most likely BASF or Dupont.
392	00:26:40	00:26:43	Probably used by every high-end garment maker in the world.
393	00:26:43	00:26:46	And black wool is definitely not used for party dresses.
394	00:26:46	00:26:49	So it's got to be from those tuxedo boys in the suite.
395	00:26:49	00:26:52	You'll have to take their clothes.
396	00:27:03	00:27:06	Thread's from your tux, kid.
397	00:27:06	00:27:08	Nothing's going to change that.
398	00:27:08	00:27:15	So the DA's offered you immunity in Nicole Jensen's death for your full cooperation in the kidnapping of Janelle Macklin.
399	00:27:16	00:27:17	Let's hear it.
400	00:27:19	00:27:21	All right, straight up.
401	00:27:21	00:27:24	Janelle hired an eye-in-the-sky geek to knock out the cameras in the service area.
402	00:27:28	00:27:32	We swooped in, scooped her out, and bam, I mean, we were over it.
403	00:27:32	00:27:35	So she paid you to kidnap her?
404	00:27:35	00:27:37	No. I wouldn't take a penny from Janelle.
405	00:27:37	00:27:39	We've been friends since grade school.
406	00:27:39	00:27:42	Oh, so you did it out of the goodness of your own heart.
407	00:27:42	00:27:44	Look, my parents have dealt cards for 20 years, all right?
408	00:27:44	00:27:45	I didn't grow up with squat.
409	00:27:45	00:27:46	Janelle, she didn't care about that.
410	00:27:47	00:27:48	She still kicked it with me.
411	00:27:48	00:27:51	So when she asked for my help, I helped.
412	00:27:51	00:27:53	Even if it involved several felonies?
413	00:27:53	00:27:55	I wasn't even thinking about that.
414	00:27:55	00:27:57	You don't even get it.
415	00:27:57	00:28:00	You don't understand what it's like to be born and raised here.
416	00:28:00	00:28:01	I mean, Vegas was a dirt lot until the '60s.
417	00:28:01	00:28:06	I mean, it's lucky that I'm not a drug dealer, and Mr. Mack should be happy Janelle's not a junkie stripper.
418	00:28:06	00:28:09	I mean, he was never there for her like my parents were there for me.
419	00:28:09	00:28:11	They instilled good values in my head.
420	00:28:11	00:28:12	Like kidnapping?
421	00:28:14	00:28:15	Who's your partner?
422	00:28:17	00:28:20	Look, counselor, you better educate your client on the meaning of full cooperation.
423	00:28:20	00:28:24	Uh-uh, nah. Vegas has got too many rats, and I'm not gonna be one of them.
424	00:28:24	00:28:27	You want to know where Janelle is, I'll tell you.
425	00:28:27	00:28:28	But you're not going to believe me.
426	00:28:28	00:28:31	Try me.
427	00:28:48	00:28:49	Don't, don't...
428	00:28:49	00:28:51	Do it! Do it! No, son! No!
429	00:28:57	00:28:59	Why did you volunteer to take a polygraph test?
430	00:28:59	00:29:01	I want to clear my name.
431	00:29:01	00:29:04	What crime have you been accused of?
432	00:29:04	00:29:07	Kidnapping Janelle Macklin.
433	00:29:31	00:29:34	Did you physically assault Janelle Macklin?
434	00:29:34	00:29:36	No way.
435	00:29:36	00:29:38	Did your partner assault Janelle Macklin?
436	00:29:38	00:29:40	No.
437	00:29:42	00:29:44	I don't know.
438	00:29:53	00:29:55	Did you kill Janelle Macklin?
439	00:29:55	00:29:56	No.
440	00:29:56	00:29:59	Do you know where she is now?
441	00:29:59	00:30:01	No.
442	00:30:01	00:30:03	It was just a prank.
443	00:30:03	00:30:04	Not deceptive.
444	00:30:04	00:30:07	So, Dean Tate was telling the truth.
445	00:30:07	00:30:10	Well, according to the polygraph, yeah.
446	00:30:10	00:30:14	Hey, guys, I got a work card hit off of that maple syrup print.
447	00:30:14	00:30:17	Let me guess. Mrs. Butterworth?
448	00:30:18	00:30:21	What are you accusing me of, eating French toast?
449	00:30:21	00:30:23	What, eating carbs is against the law now?
450	00:30:23	00:30:25	No, but kidnapping is.
451	00:30:25	00:30:27	I don't know anything about that.
452	00:30:27	00:30:29	My prints are in that room because it was Deano's room.
453	00:30:29	00:30:32	He got it so we'd have a place to bring the ladies after the dance.
454	00:30:32	00:30:38	So you're telling me when I take a sample of your DNA and compare it to the kabuki masks here...
455	00:30:39	00:30:41	that's not going to be you?
456	00:30:47	00:30:49	Deano rat me?
457	00:30:49	00:30:52	No. No, the evidence did that.
458	00:30:55	00:30:57	Look, we were playing around.
459	00:30:57	00:31:00	I bus tables every day after school, all right?
460	00:31:00	00:31:02	A grand's a lot of dough for me.
461	00:31:02	00:31:05	You know, this was a joke.
462	00:31:05	00:31:07	You see us laughing?
463	00:31:09	00:31:10	Where's Janelle?
464	00:31:10	00:31:12	I don't know.
465	00:31:12	00:31:13	When's the last time you saw her?
466	00:31:13	00:31:15	After the kidnapping.
467	00:31:15	00:31:17	Janelle planted one on my lips.
468	00:31:17	00:31:19	You know, to thank me.
469	00:31:19	00:31:21	I felt it was more than that.
470	00:31:21	00:31:22	You know, I felt a vibe.
471	00:31:22	00:31:26	I gave her an hour to chill, then I called her.
472	00:31:26	00:31:28	Asked her if I could bring her anything.
473	00:31:28	00:31:33	She said she was kind of hungry, so I told her I'd bring her something sweet to eat, other than me.
474	00:31:34	00:31:37	For a couple seconds, I thought I was in.
475	00:31:37	00:31:40	Then she got a voice mail...
476	00:31:40	00:31:43	checked it and flipped out.
477	00:31:50	00:31:58	I figured that was my cue to bolt, so I rolled back down to the dance to continue with the honeys I was already working.
478	00:31:58	00:32:00	I haven't seen Janelle since. I swear to God.
479	00:32:00	00:32:06	Well, there he is, stepping onto the main elevator from the 15th floor.
480	00:32:06	00:32:07	Alone.
481	00:32:11	00:32:15	You crack this kid's head open, all that would come out would be T and A.
482	00:32:15	00:32:16	I think you said that about me once.
483	00:32:16	00:32:18	Actually, more than once.
484	00:32:18	00:32:20	What's the time code?
485	00:32:20	00:32:22	04 a.m.
486	00:32:24	00:32:28	That's right after Janelle Macklin's last call to her voice mail.
487	00:32:28	00:32:29	Just like he said.
488	00:32:29	00:32:31	Let me access the message.
489	00:32:33	00:32:36	So when are you going to be doing your final proficiency?
490	00:32:36	00:32:38	Every time I ask Grissom, he says, next time out.
491	00:32:38	00:32:40	And then I end up here.
492	00:32:41	00:32:43	Okay, here it is.
493	00:32:43	00:32:46	I'm really disappointed with you, Janelle.
494	00:32:46	00:32:51	All these years you spent around me at the casino and you think you can put something like this over on me?
495	00:32:51	00:32:55	The only thing I'm giving you tonight Get... your...
496	00:32:55	00:32:57	ass... home.
497	00:32:57	00:33:04	And since the surveillance feed was still being time- shifted at that point, my guess is that Janelle took the service elevator out.
498	00:33:05	00:33:08	So... where does that leave us?
499	00:33:11	00:33:12	I think we're done.
500	00:33:12	00:33:14	No actual crime was committed.
501	00:33:14	00:33:17	The kidnapping wasn't real.
502	00:33:17	00:33:19	Nicole Jensen's death was plenty real.
503	00:33:19	00:33:24	Janelle Macklin's ultimately responsible for putting into motion the events that led to Nicole's death.
504	00:33:24	00:33:27	Well, the broadcast's out on Janelle and her car.
505	00:33:27	00:33:29	When she turns up, she'll have to answer for it.
506	00:33:29	00:33:31	Well, that's...
507	00:33:33	00:33:35	...highly unsatisfying.
508	00:33:37	00:33:39	You forgot this at the suite.
509	00:33:42	00:33:44	I fixed it for you.
510	00:33:44	00:33:48	You never know when you might need to get dressed up again.
511	00:33:57	00:33:58	She glued it.
512	00:34:01	00:34:05	Just keep in mind, Gil, that she is on Ecklie's team.
513	00:34:22	00:34:25	State trooper reported the car.
514	00:34:27	00:34:30	Who wants to tell Mr. Macklin?
515	00:35:31	00:35:32	Janelle left a message a couple hours ago.
516	00:35:33	00:35:35	She...
517	00:35:35	00:35:42	she was all worked up, she was crying, saying how someone threw her in the trunk of her car.
518	00:35:42	00:35:45	And then the call cuts off.
519	00:35:46	00:35:48	I thought it was just more drama.
520	00:35:48	00:35:52	This time didn't seem any different from all the others.
521	00:35:52	00:35:55	What kind of kidnapper...
522	00:35:55	00:35:58	lets you keep your cell phone?
523	00:36:00	00:36:03	You should let us answer that question.
524	00:36:03	00:36:06	Where did you find her, Captain?
525	00:36:06	00:36:09	Sunset Road.
526	00:36:09	00:36:11	Near McCarran.
527	00:36:15	00:36:18	Janelle loved airplanes when she was a kid.
528	00:36:18	00:36:21	She was always...
529	00:36:21	00:36:23	begging me to go...
530	00:36:23	00:36:27	see them take off and land.
531	00:36:27	00:36:30	I took her down there.
532	00:36:30	00:36:33	A couple of times, I think.
533	00:36:35	00:36:39	Her mother is in Paris.
534	00:36:39	00:36:41	That's, uh...
535	00:36:41	00:36:45	what... nine hours ahead.
536	00:36:45	00:36:48	Kind of late to call right now.
537	00:36:51	00:36:53	Oh, my God, Charlie.
538	00:36:55	00:36:56	They told me about Janelle.
539	00:36:56	00:36:58	I'm so sorry, honey.
540	00:36:58	00:37:00	Captain Brass, my wife.
541	00:37:01	00:37:03	How do you do?
542	00:37:03	00:37:05	I want you to find whoever did this.
543	00:37:07	00:37:09	That's what we're trying to do.
544	00:37:24	00:37:26	Now what?
545	00:37:26	00:37:32	Mr. Jensen, we need to ask you a couple of questions regarding Janelle Macklin.
546	00:37:32	00:37:37	Hm. And I thought you were gonna tell me you were gonna charge somebody with my daughter's death.
547	00:37:38	00:37:40	Drink?
548	00:37:40	00:37:41	Step out of the car, sir.
549	00:37:42	00:37:50	Not a peep about my daughter, but page one on Macklin's rich bitch.
550	00:37:50	00:37:53	Oh, you boys sure move quicker when there's cash behind it.
551	00:37:54	00:37:57	Can you account for your whereabouts in the last six hours?
552	00:37:59	00:38:01	Why don't you kiss my ass.
553	00:38:01	00:38:09	Look, we have a witness who saw Janelle Macklin get into a town car near the Hard Rock earlier this evening.
554	00:38:11	00:38:15	That's why we impounded your vehicle.
555	00:38:15	00:38:18	Found Janelle's bracelet in your car.
556	00:38:18	00:38:20	What do you think something like this is worth?
557	00:38:20	00:38:22	Hundred G's at least. Huh?
558	00:38:24	00:38:27	Enough maybe to help ease the pain?
559	00:38:27	00:38:29	For you, maybe.
560	00:38:29	00:38:31	I got a call for a pickup.
561	00:38:31	00:38:33	I went.
562	00:38:33	00:38:38	Trying to keep my head in the work, 'cause what else do I have left?
563	00:38:38	00:38:44	Mr. Jensen, you've got to believe me, I never meant for anything to happen to Nikki. You get out of this car.
564	00:38:44	00:38:46	I-I can pay...
565	00:38:46	00:38:48	whatever you need until the day I die.
566	00:38:49	00:38:52	You wanna pay!? You wanna pay!?
567	00:38:52	00:38:59	I told her I was gonna put two bullets in her head and dump her on her daddy's front step.
568	00:38:59	00:39:08	But then what, you decided maybe it'd be more fun to tie her up, let her choke to death in the trunk of her own car?
569	00:39:08	00:39:11	No.
570	00:39:11	00:39:16	I told her what I felt like doing so her father would know the way I feel.
571	00:39:16	00:39:23	And she got out, and she ran, and it's a good thing she ran, because I might've changed my mind.
572	00:39:23	00:39:24	Maybe you did.
573	00:39:27	00:39:30	I'm not that guy anymore.
574	00:39:30	00:39:33	You sure about that?
575	00:39:33	00:39:38	It really doesn't make any difference what you do to me.
576	00:39:41	00:39:44	My baby's dead.
577	00:39:44	00:39:45	C.O.D. was asphyxia.
578	00:39:45	00:39:50	Scarf lodged all the way down the esophagus, obstructing the epiglottis.
579	00:39:50	00:39:51	Completely cut off her air.
580	00:39:54	00:39:58	And the tox came back positive for benzodiazepines.
581	00:39:58	00:39:59	Yeah, that makes sense.
582	00:39:59	00:40:01	They suppress the gag reflex.
583	00:40:01	00:40:03	And knock you out at the same time.
584	00:40:03	00:40:05	Girl probably didn't even realize she was suffocating.
585	00:40:06	00:40:09	Would've been something like falling asleep.
586	00:40:09	00:40:10	All right, so...
587	00:40:10	00:40:18	based on the time that she called her father and the time we found the car, she was in the trunk at least three hours.
588	00:40:18	00:40:20	That's a slow way to go.
589	00:40:21	00:40:23	I just got off the phone with Brass.
590	00:40:23	00:40:26	Let me guess Jensen lawyered up?
591	00:40:26	00:40:28	No. He says he didn't do it.
592	00:40:28	00:40:31	And based off the DNA report, I believe him.
593	00:40:31	00:40:34	Mia found saliva and epithelials on the gag and ligature.
594	00:40:35	00:40:37	We ran them against all known suspects.
595	00:40:37	00:40:40	Everything matches Janelle Macklin.
596	00:41:31	00:41:33	Daddy, I'm...
597	00:41:33	00:41:34	I'm in really big trouble.
598	00:41:34	00:41:37	Um, some guys threw me in the trunk of my car.
599	00:41:41	00:41:44	The position of the knot was the key.
600	00:41:49	00:41:55	The only way that it could've ended up in that position was if she had tied it herself.
601	00:41:57	00:42:02	And her saliva on the ends of the scarf confirmed it.
602	00:42:02	00:42:05	You saying she committed suicide?
603	00:42:09	00:42:10	I guess I am.
604	00:42:10	00:42:13	Although I don't think that was her intention.
605	00:42:13	00:42:14	I think that she was...
606	00:42:14	00:42:16	hoping that her father would save her in time.
607	00:42:17	00:42:19	Daddy, I'm in really big trouble.
608	00:42:19	00:42:22	Um, some guys threw me in the trunk of my car.
609	00:42:22	00:42:24	You've got to believe me.
610	00:42:24	00:42:25	I-I can hear airplanes.
611	00:42:25	00:42:27	Um, I-I must be near the airport.
612	00:42:27	00:42:29	I know you'll find me. Please hurry.
