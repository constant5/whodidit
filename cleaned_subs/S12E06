0	00:00:39	00:00:40	What are you looking at?
1	00:00:40	00:00:42	The view. Oh.
2	00:00:42	00:00:44	Never seen the city from this perspective before.
3	00:00:44	00:00:45	It's beautiful.
4	00:00:45	00:00:47	Takes your breath away.
5	00:00:47	00:00:48	Yeah. It can take more than that.
6	00:00:48	00:00:52	We used to call this place the Missile Base.
7	00:00:52	00:00:53	The Missile Base. Uh-huh.
8	00:00:53	00:00:55	Care to share why?
9	00:00:55	00:00:57	Why did I bring that up? Oh!
10	00:00:57	00:00:59	All right, I'll tell you what.
11	00:00:59	00:01:01	I'll make it easy for you-- I'll go first.
12	00:01:01	00:01:05	I met my wife freshman year in college, and she was my first and only love.
13	00:01:05	00:01:07	Aw.
14	00:01:07	00:01:08	Seriously?
15	00:01:08	00:01:10	You lost your virginity to your wife?
16	00:01:10	00:01:12	Yep. Yep.
17	00:01:12	00:01:14	Life is simple sometimes.
18	00:01:14	00:01:17	You meet the right person, and you know it's forever.
19	00:01:17	00:01:19	And that was a boring story, so it's your turn.
20	00:01:19	00:01:20	Tony Anthopoulos. I was 16.
21	00:01:20	00:01:22	Too many beers, too little romance.
22	00:01:22	00:01:24	Seemed like a good idea at the time.
23	00:01:24	00:01:25	Ah, that's better.
24	00:01:25	00:01:28	Swept away by the passion of the moment.
25	00:01:28	00:01:29	Something like that.
26	00:01:29	00:01:30	Tony was a bad boy.
27	00:01:30	00:01:32	First of many.
28	00:01:32	00:01:35	I liked being wanted... till that got old.
29	00:01:35	00:01:37	Well, you're a very smart woman.
30	00:01:37	00:01:39	You probably just wanted to be appreciated for that too.
31	00:01:39	00:01:41	Yeah.
32	00:01:41	00:01:42	Hey, David.
33	00:01:42	00:01:44	Oh, hey.
34	00:01:44	00:01:46	So, what are we looking at here?
35	00:01:46	00:01:48	I'm not sure yet. Just got here myself.
36	00:01:48	00:01:50	The tarp's pretty clean.
37	00:01:50	00:01:52	Doesn't look like it's been dragged or rolled.
38	00:01:52	00:01:55	Looks more like it was carried and placed here.
39	00:01:55	00:01:57	We'll get it to Trace.
40	00:01:57	00:02:00	Concrete and caliche.
41	00:02:00	00:02:03	Not going to get any foot impressions.
42	00:02:15	00:02:17	Oh.
43	00:02:17	00:02:20	There's like a dozen needles here.
44	00:02:20	00:02:22	But there's no blood.
45	00:02:25	00:02:27	You got your shots?
46	00:02:27	00:02:28	Yeah.
47	00:02:30	00:02:33	There's some expertise demonstrated here.
48	00:02:33	00:02:37	Those needles are thrust through and through-- see that?
49	00:02:37	00:02:41	Yeah. Right under the cornified layers of the epidermis.
50	00:02:41	00:02:45	Minimize the hemorrhaging, maximize the pain.
51	00:02:45	00:02:49	Well, this was not about killing her.
52	00:02:49	00:02:51	It was about watching her suffer.
53	00:03:39	00:03:40	Morgan.
54	00:03:40	00:03:43	I heard Russell cleared you to come back.
55	00:03:43	00:03:44	If you need more time...
56	00:03:44	00:03:45	Oh, I'm good.
57	00:03:45	00:03:49	I might put off that helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon for a while.
58	00:03:49	00:03:51	Yeah, that'd probably be smart.
59	00:03:51	00:03:54	Well, since you're here, I could use a hand.
60	00:03:54	00:03:56	Yeah, no problem.
61	00:04:09	00:04:11	These are 20-gauge hypos.
62	00:04:11	00:04:14	The kind used in bone marrow transplants.
63	00:04:14	00:04:17	Killer had access to medical supplies.
64	00:04:17	00:04:21	Needles are inserted approximately three inches apart.
65	00:04:21	00:04:25	Perpendicular, in a line, wrist to wrist.
66	00:04:25	00:04:27	You think the pattern is significant?
67	00:04:27	00:04:29	Seems ritualistic.
68	00:04:29	00:04:31	But it's definitely sadistic. Yeah.
69	00:04:32	00:04:34	Hold on.
70	00:04:35	00:04:37	This isn't a hypo.
71	00:04:41	00:04:42	Shish kabob skewer.
72	00:04:44	00:04:47	It's a black residue.
73	00:04:48	00:04:50	Looks like candle wax.
74	00:04:52	00:04:54	The scarring-- it's all over her body.
75	00:04:54	00:04:57	Consistent with the needles and the skewer.
76	00:04:57	00:05:02	You'd think after all these years, I wouldn't be surprised by what people are capable of.
77	00:05:12	00:05:13	Hodges? (gasps)
78	00:05:13	00:05:14	What are you doing?
79	00:05:14	00:05:15	Scusi.
80	00:05:15	00:05:18	Did Lorenzo interrupt Michelangelo when he was creating?
81	00:05:18	00:05:20	He didn't wrap bodies in his canvas.
82	00:05:20	00:05:23	And I thought you said you didn't find any trace on this.
83	00:05:23	00:05:24	Not trace.
84	00:05:24	00:05:26	Something better.
85	00:05:26	00:05:28	Art.
86	00:05:28	00:05:29	Are you familiar with a pentimento?
87	00:05:29	00:05:32	What do you think?
88	00:05:32	00:05:34	It's an alteration in a painting.
89	00:05:34	00:05:40	When an artist makes a mistake or they want to change something, they simply whitewash over the error, and then begin again.
90	00:05:40	00:05:45	I don't want to get too excited, but we may have a lost treasure here.
91	00:05:45	00:05:47	Maybe even a Rembrandt.
92	00:05:47	00:05:49	Really? Uh...
93	00:05:49	00:05:50	scusi.
94	00:05:50	00:05:53	Hmm? Oh.
95	00:05:53	00:05:55	Prego.
96	00:06:02	00:06:04	Mm.
97	00:06:04	00:06:05	I am getting excited.
98	00:06:05	00:06:06	See?
99	00:06:06	00:06:08	What I see is more layers.
100	00:06:08	00:06:10	More paint, Leonardo.
101	00:06:10	00:06:14	Maybe what's under here will give us a clue to our killer.
102	00:06:14	00:06:15	So stop your scratching.
103	00:06:15	00:06:18	Canvas is mine now.
104	00:06:18	00:06:20	Huh. (speaks Italian)
105	00:06:20	00:06:23	Hey, you better hope I don't find out what that means.
106	00:06:23	00:06:25	I ran our Jane Doe information through Missing Persons.
107	00:06:25	00:06:27	Nothing. Run it again.
108	00:06:27	00:06:29	I did. I know.
109	00:06:29	00:06:30	It doesn't make sense.
110	00:06:30	00:06:34	The injuries, the evidence all suggest that she was abducted weeks ago.
111	00:06:34	00:06:37	Somebody should have missed her by now.
112	00:06:37	00:06:38	Doctor.
113	00:06:38	00:06:40	Hey. Hey.
114	00:06:50	00:06:52	So, C.O.D.?
115	00:06:52	00:06:54	Don't know yet.
116	00:06:54	00:06:56	I sent samples off to Toxicology.
117	00:06:56	00:06:58	We'll see what Henry has to say.
118	00:06:58	00:07:04	As you both observed, the external scarring indicates a prolonged period of abuse.
119	00:07:04	00:07:08	However, I did find something unusual about the injuries.
120	00:07:08	00:07:10	Scar tissue in the wound tracts.
121	00:07:10	00:07:15	It's as if the needles and the skewer were inserted in the same areas repeatedly.
122	00:07:15	00:07:16	You mean like body piercing?
123	00:07:16	00:07:23	Similar. In piercing, a needle's inserted through the skin, penetrating the various layers of the epidermis.
124	00:07:23	00:07:28	As scar tissue develops, a permanent hole is created.
125	00:07:28	00:07:31	Difference in this case is, we're not talking about piercings.
126	00:07:31	00:07:33	No. No, we're not.
127	00:07:33	00:07:40	We're talking about 20-gauge needles and a barbecue skewer driven repeatedly into this girl's flesh.
128	00:07:40	00:07:42	That's what we're talking about.
129	00:07:46	00:07:48	What is this? Is this a knee implant?
130	00:07:48	00:07:49	Hers, I assume.
131	00:07:49	00:07:52	She had unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.
132	00:07:52	00:07:59	Likely due to injury, given the attenuation Whatever the case, we have a lot number, which will give us an orthopedic surgeon.
133	00:07:59	00:08:02	And a name for our...
134	00:08:02	00:08:04	our Jane Doe.
135	00:08:09	00:08:16	Renny was born with an angular limb deformity in both rear legs, which means that her back legs were growing faster than her front legs.
136	00:08:16	00:08:25	A horse foal my daughter Sylvia is nursing has the same condition, so, in order to help the bones grow, we performed a brief surgical procedure called a peristeal stripping. Now...
137	00:08:25	00:08:27	Dr. Grier? Yes?
138	00:08:27	00:08:29	I'm Catherine Willows with the Crime Lab.
139	00:08:29	00:08:31	I need to speak with you.
140	00:08:31	00:08:32	I'm sorry. I'm in the middle of a seminar.
141	00:08:32	00:08:34	It's about your sister Rachel.
142	00:08:37	00:08:40	So, when was the last time that you saw your sister?
143	00:08:40	00:08:42	I haven't seen Rachel in years.
144	00:08:42	00:08:43	She called me a few months ago.
145	00:08:43	00:08:46	Um, she had some medical bills, needed money.
146	00:08:46	00:08:49	Fort Lauderdale. She had knee surgery.
147	00:08:49	00:08:52	I just wired her the money.
148	00:08:52	00:08:54	I stopped asking questions a long time ago.
149	00:08:54	00:08:55	What do you mean?
150	00:08:55	00:08:58	My little sister was a wild child.
151	00:08:58	00:09:01	She ran away after high school.
152	00:09:01	00:09:04	She broke my mother's heart.
153	00:09:04	00:09:07	Rachel couldn't even be bothered to come to her funeral.
154	00:09:09	00:09:11	You say that she met with violence.
155	00:09:11	00:09:13	What does that mean? What happened?
156	00:09:13	00:09:15	I'm sorry; I can't discuss the specifics.
157	00:09:15	00:09:23	What I can tell you is that we found her here in Vegas, and we suspect that she was taken against her will, probably several weeks ago.
158	00:09:23	00:09:26	That's impossible.
159	00:09:26	00:09:29	I had lunch with Aunt Rachel on Monday, and she was totally fine.
160	00:09:29	00:09:30	You had lunch with Rachel?
161	00:09:30	00:09:32	I didn't even know she was in town...
162	00:09:32	00:09:35	Excuse me, Sylvia, you saw your aunt three days ago?
163	00:09:35	00:09:40	Yeah. I mean, she called, and she said that she was in town and needed to talk.
164	00:09:40	00:09:42	Made me promise not to say anything.
165	00:09:42	00:09:44	Why?
166	00:09:44	00:09:48	My mom and Aunt Rachel don't really talk.
167	00:09:48	00:09:52	But Aunt Rachel wanted things to change; she wanted to fix things.
168	00:09:52	00:09:54	She wanted to come home.
169	00:09:54	00:09:57	Where did you and your Aunt Rachel have lunch?
170	00:09:57	00:09:59	The Tangiers.
171	00:09:59	00:10:01	I don't know. Maybe she was staying there.
172	00:10:03	00:10:05	Hey, Catherine.
173	00:10:05	00:10:09	Tangiers was a bust-- Rachel Grier was never registered, and no one I.D.'d her photo.
174	00:10:09	00:10:11	Yeah, I'm on it.
175	00:10:11	00:10:12	Hey, Henry, got my tox report?
176	00:10:12	00:10:14	Yeah, right here.
177	00:10:14	00:10:15	Great.
178	00:10:15	00:10:16	Mm, not so great.
179	00:10:16	00:10:18	What's the problem?
180	00:10:18	00:10:22	You'll find the findings are both inconclusive and, well, confusing.
181	00:10:22	00:10:24	She had lidocaine in her system?
182	00:10:24	00:10:25	But it didn't kill her.
183	00:10:25	00:10:30	Injected at therapeutic levels directly into the tissue surrounding the hypodermic needles.
184	00:10:30	00:10:32	And the skewer.
185	00:10:32	00:10:36	What kind of sadist uses an anesthetic before torturing their victims?
186	00:11:14	00:11:17	I dug out these images, using optical microscopy.
187	00:11:17	00:11:19	So what are we feeling about this?
188	00:11:19	00:11:25	Depressed. Yeah, I mean, You know, maybe it's a Rachel Grier.
189	00:11:25	00:11:27	I mean, look at that.
190	00:11:27	00:11:29	That's gotta be more than a coincidence.
191	00:11:31	00:11:34	Yeah, there's a similar pattern to the needles in her arms.
192	00:11:34	00:11:37	And the flames-- we did find candle wax residue.
193	00:11:37	00:11:42	Now, is it me or does she look like a human candelabra?
194	00:11:42	00:11:44	All right, let's think about this.
195	00:11:44	00:11:47	Maybe our victim was posed to look like this painting.
196	00:11:47	00:11:53	So you're saying you think that our killer was inspired by this image? Maybe.
197	00:11:53	00:11:56	Or maybe the killer got artistic as he was torturing her.
198	00:11:56	00:12:03	Poses her, paints her, doesn't like his work, so he whitewashes over it, and then just wraps her up in his failure.
199	00:12:03	00:12:10	Question is, which came first-- Rachel Grier or Rachel Grier?
200	00:12:10	00:12:12	Hey, guys.
201	00:12:12	00:12:14	I just did an image search for human candelabra.
202	00:12:14	00:12:16	Check it out.
203	00:12:16	00:12:20	Major Willie's Rambling Carnival and Curious Extravaganza.
204	00:12:20	00:12:21	Which century you get this out of?
205	00:12:23	00:12:30	This one, as in tonight, two shows, 00 and 10 Featuring the Human Candelabra.
206	00:12:30	00:12:35	The Magnificent Femmistopheles, Empress of Pain.
207	00:12:35	00:12:38	Looks like it's time for a road trip.
208	00:12:43	00:12:46	You wish to try? Only ten bucks to try.
209	00:13:10	00:13:12	That's the oldest trick in the book.
210	00:13:12	00:13:14	About all they're good for nowadays.
211	00:13:20	00:13:22	Come up and get your darts.
212	00:13:22	00:13:25	You buy the darts for ten of your Yankee dollars.
213	00:13:25	00:13:29	Now, who will be next?
214	00:13:29	00:13:32	Pop the cherry, win a prize.
215	00:13:32	00:13:34	Come on, you have to do better than that.
216	00:13:34	00:13:36	Pop the cherry, win a prize.
217	00:13:36	00:13:37	This is entertainment?
218	00:13:38	00:13:40	Hard to tell who's more entertained.
219	00:13:43	00:13:46	Well done, mate.
220	00:13:46	00:13:48	Sorry, kitty's not a virgin.
221	00:13:50	00:13:52	Zodiac will be back in 15 minutes.
222	00:13:53	00:13:55	Be seeing you.
223	00:14:00	00:14:02	Oh... my... God.
224	00:14:05	00:14:08	Oh, it looks like Femmistopheles is a no-show.
225	00:14:08	00:14:10	I want to look inside.
226	00:14:11	00:14:12	Can I help you?
227	00:14:12	00:14:15	We're from the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
228	00:14:15	00:14:18	Sorry, no comping the constables here, I'm afraid.
229	00:14:18	00:14:21	So who's in charge of this freak show?
230	00:14:21	00:14:24	Me-- you've seen the game, you know the name.
231	00:14:24	00:14:25	Major Willie at your service.
232	00:14:25	00:14:27	Good to know.
233	00:14:27	00:14:28	Have you seen this woman?
234	00:14:28	00:14:30	Seen her?
235	00:14:30	00:14:32	I've seen all of her.
236	00:14:32	00:14:34	Femmistopheles, Empress of Pain.
237	00:14:35	00:14:37	So, what'd she do this time?
238	00:14:37	00:14:38	She's dead.
239	00:14:38	00:14:42	That's... unfortunate.
240	00:14:42	00:14:44	You don't seem too broken up.
241	00:14:44	00:14:46	Or surprised.
242	00:14:46	00:14:48	Maybe we know why.
243	00:14:55	00:14:58	Am I surprised Rachel's dead?
244	00:14:58	00:14:59	And why is that?
245	00:14:59	00:15:01	Well, take a look around you.
246	00:15:01	00:15:04	You've heard what your friend said-- we're freaks.
247	00:15:04	00:15:12	You try cranking up this whoopee machine two shows a night, on the road 351 days a year, ending up in places you wouldn't want to be seen dead in.
248	00:15:13	00:15:16	Sorry, poor choice.
249	00:15:16	00:15:20	So what was it-- O.D., old ex?
250	00:15:20	00:15:23	Rachel always did have the most appalling taste in men.
251	00:15:23	00:15:25	Does that include you?
252	00:15:25	00:15:28	I was the best thing that ever happened to her.
253	00:15:28	00:15:31	I saw qualities in Rachel she couldn't see in herself.
254	00:15:31	00:15:33	Lucky girl.
255	00:15:33	00:15:38	Willie, we need to check out that tent, so you gonna step aside or do we need to go get a warrant?
256	00:15:38	00:15:40	Boss.
257	00:15:40	00:15:42	Joey needs his intro.
258	00:15:42	00:15:45	Zodiac, aidez les gendarmes.
259	00:15:46	00:15:47	It's all good.
260	00:15:47	00:15:49	I'm gonna keep my eye on Willie.
261	00:15:49	00:15:51	Yeah, D.B., I'm gonna grab some equipment.
262	00:15:51	00:15:53	I'll be right back.
263	00:16:00	00:16:08	Life is full of terrible surprises and miserable fates.
264	00:16:08	00:16:27	Consider that of a young woman, heavy with child, mauled by a ferocious pachyderm-- her son born hideously deformed, yet able to sow the seeds of future generations, all cursed to the same twisted destiny.
265	00:16:27	00:16:35	Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the last heir of the House of Merrick-- Joseph the Elephant Man!
266	00:16:35	00:16:37	Aw, come on.
267	00:16:37	00:16:39	Surprised?
268	00:16:39	00:16:42	Disgusted?
269	00:16:42	00:16:45	Not what you paid to see?
270	00:16:45	00:16:53	I want to draw your attention to the condition of this poor specimen.
271	00:16:53	00:17:00	Note the aquiline jaw, the sharp, muscular definition.
272	00:17:00	00:17:04	This animal... is not one of us.
273	00:17:04	00:17:09	He is not a freak, a freak like me.
274	00:17:22	00:17:24	Watch as she continues to wrap these chains around me...
275	00:17:42	00:17:44	I got hypos and skewers.
276	00:17:44	00:17:46	I got blood.
277	00:17:50	00:17:55	If she was tortured in this chair, the blood pattern's off.
278	00:17:55	00:17:56	There's no void.
279	00:18:02	00:18:04	Hey-- see these streaks?
280	00:18:04	00:18:06	This contraption could be our blood source.
281	00:18:06	00:18:08	Where is, uh...?
282	00:18:08	00:18:09	Oh, yeah.
283	00:18:09	00:18:11	What, what do I call you again?
284	00:18:11	00:18:15	Zodiac. Can you tell us a little bit more about Femmistopheles' act?
285	00:18:15	00:18:17	Wasn't an act.
286	00:18:17	00:18:19	It was unlike anything you ever seen.
287	00:18:41	00:18:44	She didn't just give a performance.
288	00:18:44	00:18:46	She gave her own blood.
289	00:18:46	00:18:48	She rocked the house.
290	00:18:48	00:18:51	And people-- what, they'd pay extra to see this?
291	00:18:51	00:18:55	What's the point in torturing yourself if we ain't all going to have some fun?
292	00:18:55	00:18:58	Okay, and what's back there?
293	00:18:58	00:18:59	Femmie's dressing room.
294	00:18:59	00:19:01	She lived in it.
295	00:19:42	00:19:43	Ah...
296	00:19:43	00:19:45	Empress of pain and pleasure.
297	00:19:48	00:19:50	You mind?
298	00:19:51	00:19:53	Thought you were a coffee snob.
299	00:19:53	00:19:55	Machine in my office is broken.
300	00:19:55	00:19:57	I'm waiting for parts.
301	00:19:59	00:20:02	(sniffs) Mm.
302	00:20:02	00:20:04	A little light reading, I see.
303	00:20:04	00:20:07	Satisfying my curiosity.
304	00:20:07	00:20:14	So Nick and I found a whole pharmacy in Rachel Grier's tent, including lidocaine.
305	00:20:14	00:20:15	Henry is sourcing the stuff for me.
306	00:20:15	00:20:18	Also running an expanded tox panel.
307	00:20:18	00:20:20	Maybe one of the other drugs killed her.
308	00:20:20	00:20:23	Here, we thought some sick bastard tortured the girl.
309	00:20:23	00:20:24	Maybe she OD'd.
310	00:20:24	00:20:26	Nah, you know, I don't think so, actually.
311	00:20:26	00:20:31	I mean, she certainly wouldn't have wrapped up her own body and dumped it. No.
312	00:20:31	00:20:33	You know, there's something about this Major Willie.
313	00:20:33	00:20:36	He reminds me of...
314	00:20:36	00:20:39	I told you about my parents being singers, right?
315	00:20:39	00:20:41	Yeah. Performers, really.
316	00:20:41	00:20:45	When I was a kid, they were part of this traveling show.
317	00:20:45	00:20:48	We went around the country in our van.
318	00:20:48	00:20:54	Anyway, the leader of this group was a, a guy who called himself Durga Joe.
319	00:20:54	00:20:59	He was a real charismatic, kind of like this Willie guy.
320	00:20:59	00:21:01	He could make people...
321	00:21:01	00:21:05	he could make people do pretty much anything he wanted.
322	00:21:05	00:21:13	That was the problem, at least for my parents, so, one day they decided they wanted to leave and Durga Joe did not like that at all.
323	00:21:13	00:21:14	What happened?
324	00:21:14	00:21:18	In the middle of the night, we got in our van and we just took off.
325	00:21:18	00:21:20	And never really... looked back.
326	00:21:20	00:21:26	Anyway... the point is that this Rachel Grier, she wanted to leave, too, you know?
327	00:21:26	00:21:28	She wanted to go home.
328	00:21:28	00:21:30	Maybe this is about control.
329	00:21:30	00:21:34	Major Willie's Rambling Carnival-- one big, happy family.
330	00:21:34	00:21:36	Until somebody wants to leave.
331	00:21:36	00:21:38	Got your new and improved tox panel.
332	00:21:38	00:21:42	I know what killed Rachel Grier and maybe who.
333	00:21:44	00:21:48	Major Willie-- aka Steven Watt of Tampa, Florida.
334	00:21:48	00:21:53	You know, without the Willy Wonka get-up, you could pass for just another freak.
335	00:21:53	00:22:00	The word is geek, as in someone who can perform freakish acts without actually themselves being a freak of nature.
336	00:22:00	00:22:01	I'll take your word for it.
337	00:22:01	00:22:03	And I will take that.
338	00:22:03	00:22:05	Oh, look.
339	00:22:05	00:22:07	What's he going to do?
340	00:22:15	00:22:17	Yeah, and if you think that's freaky...
341	00:22:26	00:22:31	(splutters) Don't worry, I'll regurgitate it later.
342	00:22:31	00:22:34	Wow. We gotta learn how to do that.
343	00:22:35	00:22:37	So, uh...
344	00:22:37	00:22:40	we know what killed Rachel-- propofol.
345	00:22:40	00:22:48	Which is used in anesthesia, but in high enough doses and without a ventilator, it paralyzes the diaphragm.
346	00:22:48	00:22:50	So basically...
347	00:22:50	00:22:53	Rachel... suffocated to death.
348	00:22:53	00:22:57	You're licensed in Florida and New York to practice body piercings and modifications.
349	00:22:57	00:23:02	That's how you were able to obtain the pharmaceuticals we found in Rachel's tent.
350	00:23:02	00:23:04	You people just don't get it.
351	00:23:04	00:23:06	We don't get what?
352	00:23:06	00:23:08	Freaks versus geeks.
353	00:23:08	00:23:12	A guy like Zodiac, he has congenital analgesia.
354	00:23:12	00:23:15	He was born not feeling pain-- a freak.
355	00:23:15	00:23:18	Rachel and me, we need...
356	00:23:18	00:23:20	needed help.
357	00:23:20	00:23:22	A little pharmacology.
358	00:23:22	00:23:27	Stuff like lidocaine, to take the edge off the pain, to enhance performance.
359	00:23:32	00:23:36	No drugs, no show, no dough.
360	00:23:36	00:23:41	I won't lie-- maybe at the end of the evening we all like to indulge in a little...
361	00:23:41	00:23:43	something something...
362	00:23:43	00:23:46	to ease an old carney's burden.
363	00:23:46	00:23:48	But straight up...
364	00:23:48	00:23:52	I am a businessman; I look after my people, I take care of them.
365	00:23:52	00:23:55	And Rachel, she was an earner.
366	00:23:55	00:23:59	Who wanted to stop earning, I believe.
367	00:23:59	00:24:01	She would never have left me.
368	00:24:06	00:24:10	You didn't find any propofol in Rachel's tent, did you?
369	00:24:10	00:24:11	No.
370	00:24:11	00:24:13	Am I under arrest?
371	00:24:13	00:24:15	Not yet, no.
372	00:24:15	00:24:18	But this, uh, this is just our opening act.
373	00:24:18	00:24:20	Here. One for the road.
374	00:24:22	00:24:28	Got the DNA results from Rachel Grier's tent-- the blood Russell found in the fridge is a match to Rachel.
375	00:24:28	00:24:30	Also the torture chair. Well, it makes sense.
376	00:24:30	00:24:32	Rachel was storing her blood to use in her act.
377	00:24:32	00:24:37	Yeah, well, the blood also tells us another story-- hormone levels suggest that Rachel was pregnant.
378	00:24:37	00:24:42	Labels on the pack say as recently as two weeks ago.
379	00:24:42	00:24:44	There was no evidence in autopsy.
380	00:24:44	00:24:46	Not just that.
381	00:24:46	00:24:51	Nick found traces of blood and semen in Rachel's bed.
382	00:24:51	00:24:53	Single donor.
383	00:24:53	00:24:54	No hits in CODIS.
384	00:24:54	00:25:02	Profile is a male Caucasian suffering from neurofibromatosis type-1 and Proteus Syndrome.
385	00:25:03	00:25:05	Rachel was sleeping with the Elephant Man?
386	00:25:22	00:25:25	So, last heir to the House of Merrick.
387	00:25:25	00:25:26	That's a good story.
388	00:25:26	00:25:29	I saw the movie, too-- it was... I liked it.
389	00:25:29	00:25:33	But truth is, there is... no house, right?
390	00:25:33	00:25:36	Because the Elephant Man didn't have any children.
391	00:25:36	00:25:40	So your name's not really Merrick, is it?
392	00:25:40	00:25:42	No. My name is Joshua Helm.
393	00:25:42	00:25:45	And, Joshua, you don't have any children, either, do you?
394	00:25:45	00:25:48	No. Rachel Grier made sure of that.
395	00:25:48	00:25:50	She got rid of the baby.
396	00:25:50	00:25:53	Just like she wanted to get rid of you.
397	00:25:53	00:25:55	You don't know what you're saying.
398	00:25:55	00:25:57	Rachel and I were in love.
399	00:25:57	00:26:01	Is that why she was making plans to leave the show? Yes.
400	00:26:01	00:26:06	I told her she was crazy, that we couldn't have a normal life on the outside.
401	00:26:06	00:26:10	Wait-wait-wait a minute. So you're saying that the two of you were planning on going away together?
402	00:26:10	00:26:12	That's what she wanted.
403	00:26:12	00:26:15	You could survive on the outside, but I can't.
404	00:26:15	00:26:17	You can with me.
405	00:26:17	00:26:20	I love you, Joshua-- that's all that matters.
406	00:26:20	00:26:24	Rachel had lost the child, and she wanted to try again.
407	00:26:24	00:26:26	I said no.
408	00:26:26	00:26:30	I told her she could leave if she wanted to, but that I wasn't going with her.
409	00:26:30	00:26:34	Rachel was always naive, living in a fantasy land.
410	00:26:34	00:26:37	You do tell a good story.
411	00:26:44	00:26:47	Is that what you think this is?
412	00:26:47	00:26:51	I've already seen the show, and I'm familiar with the story.
413	00:26:51	00:27:01	Girl hates her life, is searching for something, thinks she finds it in a man, a man who needs her, and then...
414	00:27:01	00:27:03	it all goes wrong.
415	00:27:03	00:27:07	You killed her because she wanted her life back.
416	00:27:07	00:27:14	Look... I don't know what happened to Rachel, and if you're trying to provoke me, it's not working.
417	00:27:15	00:27:24	You can't imagine how the love that we had for each other existed, because you've never known it.
418	00:27:24	00:27:26	And you never will.
419	00:27:29	00:27:33	So, we turned Major Willie's Carnival upside down, didn't find any propofol.
420	00:27:33	00:27:35	We have any record of him buying the stuff?
421	00:27:35	00:27:41	No, we have nothing to tie him to the drugs that killed Rachel, (phone rings) and Brass just cut him loose.
422	00:27:41	00:27:42	Stokes.
423	00:27:42	00:27:44	Yeah.
424	00:27:44	00:27:46	You kidding me?
425	00:27:46	00:27:49	Greg'll be interested to hear that. Thanks, Jimbo.
426	00:27:49	00:27:53	Well, it looks like we're gonna have to cut Major Willie loose again.
427	00:28:00	00:28:01	Well...
428	00:28:01	00:28:03	rigor hasn't set in.
429	00:28:03	00:28:06	T.O.D.'s less than two hours ago.
430	00:28:06	00:28:08	No vital response.
431	00:28:08	00:28:10	He was dead before he was hanged.
432	00:28:10	00:28:12	Staged.
433	00:28:12	00:28:13	Yeah, poorly.
434	00:28:13	00:28:16	Okay, cut him down, get him to Autopsy.
435	00:28:16	00:28:17	Let's find out what really killed him.
436	00:28:17	00:28:19	CSI Stokes?
437	00:28:19	00:28:22	Yeah. We've got a suspect in custody.
438	00:28:25	00:28:27	You need to stay back, okay?
439	00:28:27	00:28:29	Which one of the freaks is it?
440	00:28:29	00:28:31	There.
441	00:28:33	00:28:35	Suspect's name is Sylvia Grier.
442	00:28:35	00:28:38	Rachel Grier's niece?
443	00:29:03	00:29:05	This is insane.
444	00:29:05	00:29:10	Dr. Grier, your daughter was detained while fleeing the scene of an apparent homicide.
445	00:29:10	00:29:17	I... I don't know what Sylvia was doing at that freak show, but... but I do know that she would never hurt anyone.
446	00:29:17	00:29:20	Well, then neither you nor Sylvia has anything to be afraid of.
447	00:29:22	00:29:24	What were you doing there, Sylvia?
448	00:29:24	00:29:28	I went there because I needed to see for myself.
449	00:29:28	00:29:30	See what?
450	00:29:30	00:29:33	S--see who my aunt really was.
451	00:29:33	00:29:40	I found the story online, Sideshow Performer Murdered, and it was Aunt Rachel.
452	00:29:40	00:29:45	To my mom, Aunt Rachel was a ghost, but...
453	00:29:45	00:29:48	to me, she was like this...
454	00:29:48	00:29:50	force of nature.
455	00:29:50	00:29:57	You know? She did what she wanted to do and lived how she wanted to live, and I just felt this...
456	00:29:57	00:29:59	connection.
457	00:30:01	00:30:04	I mean, is that weird?
458	00:30:04	00:30:08	Look, I didn't kill that man.
459	00:30:08	00:30:10	Why don't you tell me what happened?
460	00:30:10	00:30:15	I went looking for where Aunt Rachel had been living, and I got lost.
461	00:30:15	00:30:18	And I wandered into that tent, and that's when I saw him.
462	00:30:21	00:30:24	I was so scared.
463	00:30:24	00:30:27	And then, they were all staring at me.
464	00:30:27	00:30:30	I mean, they thought I did it.
465	00:30:30	00:30:32	So I ran.
466	00:30:32	00:30:34	And I hid, but the officers found me.
467	00:30:36	00:30:38	I didn't do anything.
468	00:30:40	00:30:42	Do you believe her?
469	00:30:42	00:30:44	Sylvia? Yes.
470	00:30:44	00:30:46	Well, I don't know what to believe anymore.
471	00:30:46	00:30:49	I think I made a mistake about Major Willie.
472	00:30:49	00:30:52	I think I let my past cloud my thinking.
473	00:30:52	00:30:53	Well, we're all guilty of that.
474	00:30:53	00:30:55	Whoa, what do you mean?
475	00:30:55	00:30:58	You're not having doubts about our Elephant Man, are you?
476	00:30:58	00:31:00	No. No.
477	00:31:00	00:31:07	I mean, I don't like being called out about my lack of romance, but it's no argument for innocence.
478	00:31:07	00:31:11	You still think Elephant Man had motive to kill Rachel?
479	00:31:11	00:31:20	Yes. Yes, and I think Sylvia was sincere about feeling a connection towards her aunt, which says to me that she wouldn't do her any harm.
480	00:31:20	00:31:26	Okay. But that doesn't mean that she wouldn't go after the man who she believed did.
481	00:31:26	00:31:27	Major Willie?
482	00:31:27	00:31:29	But why would she suspect that he killed Rachel?
483	00:31:29	00:31:32	We're not even convinced ourselves.
484	00:31:32	00:31:34	Maybe somebody whispered Willie's name in her ear.
485	00:31:34	00:31:36	Maybe our real killer.
486	00:31:42	00:31:44	Okay.
487	00:31:44	00:31:46	What have we got here, boys?
488	00:31:46	00:31:48	Well, your carnival barker's C.O.D.
489	00:31:48	00:31:56	was massive internal hemorrhaging due to an inch-and-a-half laceration and perforation of the stomach wall, severing the left gastro-omental artery.
490	00:31:56	00:31:58	Check it out.
491	00:31:58	00:32:01	Stomach wall's punctured from the inside out.
492	00:32:01	00:32:05	That's bigger than a paper clip.
493	00:32:05	00:32:08	I found no injuries to the pharynx or esophagus.
494	00:32:08	00:32:12	So, it's not like somebody shoved something down his throat.
495	00:32:12	00:32:13	No, no.
496	00:32:13	00:32:15	Guy swallowed a sword.
497	00:32:15	00:32:16	Check that out.
498	00:32:16	00:32:18	Well, that would do it.
499	00:32:18	00:32:21	Actually, our friend here swallowed lots of things.
500	00:32:21	00:32:23	Bon appétit, gentlemen.
501	00:32:51	00:32:54	Good thing for us, Major Willie bit off more than he could chew.
502	00:32:55	00:32:57	Gemini.
503	00:32:57	00:33:00	Sign of the Zodiac.
504	00:33:00	00:33:02	Take your shirt off.
505	00:33:02	00:33:06	You want to play, you got to pay.
506	00:33:06	00:33:08	Oh, I got my ticket right here, Muscles.
507	00:33:08	00:33:10	It's called a search warrant.
508	00:33:10	00:33:12	Now, take it off.
509	00:33:25	00:33:28	If you want a picture with me, your friend right there I'm sure will take it.
510	00:33:28	00:33:30	No, that's all right. I'll pass.
511	00:33:30	00:33:32	We're done here.
512	00:33:32	00:33:35	Check him for warrants while you're at it.
513	00:33:38	00:33:40	Catherine, it's Nick.
514	00:33:40	00:33:42	No go on Zodiac.
515	00:33:42	00:33:44	We're gonna need a pile of warrants.
516	00:33:44	00:33:46	We're gonna need to bring the whole freak show down here.
517	00:34:10	00:34:12	I need to see your chest, too.
518	00:34:14	00:34:16	You want some help?
519	00:34:24	00:34:26	Remove the bandage.
520	00:34:30	00:34:32	Dog bite.
521	00:34:32	00:34:35	I hope you had all your shots.
522	00:34:35	00:34:38	Sergio the Strong.
523	00:34:38	00:34:40	Where do you people come up with the stage names?
524	00:34:40	00:34:42	I mean, I get it, I do.
525	00:34:42	00:34:46	Because Seth the Strong doesn't look good on a poster.
526	00:34:46	00:34:50	But Seth Soon-To-Be-Convicted-- that has a ring to it.
527	00:34:50	00:34:53	We got back the DNA profile on your ounce of flesh.
528	00:34:53	00:34:57	Looks like you and the Elephant Man were fraternal twins.
529	00:34:57	00:35:00	I got to admit, I didn't see that coming.
530	00:35:00	00:35:03	And let me guess, mom always liked you best.
531	00:35:03	00:35:06	We know Rachel broke your brother's heart.
532	00:35:06	00:35:08	You made her pay for that.
533	00:35:08	00:35:11	And then when Willie found out what you did, you shut him up, too. Is that about right?
534	00:35:13	00:35:17	Our mom died during childbirth.
535	00:35:17	00:35:19	Dad dumped us before we could walk.
536	00:35:19	00:35:26	And when Joshua started to... change, the relatives we were staying with got freaked out.
537	00:35:26	00:35:29	Said that Joshua and me were born of the devil.
538	00:35:29	00:35:32	For my brother, there was only one path to salvation.
539	00:35:32	00:35:37	Major Willie's Rambling Carnival and Curious Extravaganza.
540	00:35:37	00:35:41	Willie was no saint, but he was better than most.
541	00:35:41	00:35:44	He didn't treat my brother like a monster.
542	00:35:44	00:35:46	He was... he was good to him.
543	00:35:48	00:35:50	Until...
544	00:35:50	00:35:51	Until what?
545	00:35:55	00:35:57	What the hell happened?
546	00:35:57	00:35:59	I don't know.
547	00:35:59	00:36:01	I just found her like this.
548	00:36:01	00:36:03	Maybe she OD'd or something.
549	00:36:03	00:36:04	You call the cops?
550	00:36:04	00:36:06	You crazy?
551	00:36:06	00:36:07	They'll close us down.
552	00:36:07	00:36:08	You got to help me, Seth.
553	00:36:08	00:36:10	We need to make this go away.
554	00:36:10	00:36:13	Think about your brother.
555	00:36:13	00:36:14	No show.
556	00:36:14	00:36:16	Where does that leave him?
557	00:36:19	00:36:21	So I did what he asked me.
558	00:36:33	00:36:35	I made it all go away.
559	00:36:35	00:36:37	But it didn't go away.
560	00:36:37	00:36:40	And we all know that Rachel didn't just OD.
561	00:36:40	00:36:44	You people found out what was going on between Joshua and Rachel.
562	00:36:44	00:36:47	You hauled him in here, you questioned him.
563	00:36:47	00:36:48	But he didn't do it.
564	00:36:48	00:36:50	How do you know that?
565	00:36:50	00:36:51	'Cause I know who did.
566	00:36:51	00:36:53	Cops picked up Joshua.
567	00:36:53	00:36:55	Don't sweat it.
568	00:36:55	00:36:56	That's just what they do.
569	00:36:56	00:36:58	Josh will be fine.
570	00:36:58	00:37:01	Best thing you can do is to keep your mouth shut.
571	00:37:01	00:37:03	Trust me.
572	00:37:07	00:37:09	Not this time.
573	00:37:33	00:37:36	I didn't mean to kill him.
574	00:37:36	00:37:42	I thought that if I made it look like he killed himself, that it all would really go away.
575	00:37:43	00:37:46	You don't believe me, do you?
576	00:37:46	00:37:49	We believe the evidence.
577	00:38:02	00:38:05	There's your evidence.
578	00:38:05	00:38:07	Willie killed Rachel.
579	00:38:18	00:38:21	Heard the suspect coughed up the smoking gun.
580	00:38:21	00:38:24	Yeah.
581	00:38:24	00:38:26	What, did Nick leave you to do the dirty work?
582	00:38:26	00:38:28	No. Actually, I wanted to run this myself.
583	00:38:28	00:38:32	So, Sergio found the propofol when he was cleaning up Rachel's tent?
584	00:38:32	00:38:36	Yeah, he had doubts about Willie, so he decided to hang on to this.
585	00:38:36	00:38:38	In his stomach?
586	00:38:38	00:38:40	Better than a safety deposit box, I guess.
587	00:38:40	00:38:42	Little messier.
588	00:38:42	00:38:44	So the propofol belonged to Willie?
589	00:38:44	00:38:46	That's what Sergio thinks.
590	00:38:46	00:38:47	I'm not so sure.
591	00:38:47	00:38:49	Why not?
592	00:38:49	00:38:51	Willie was the resident Dr. Feel Good.
593	00:38:51	00:38:56	Well, if we're to believe Sergio's story, Willie talked him into dumping a body for him.
594	00:38:56	00:38:58	I mean, come on.
595	00:38:58	00:39:00	Guys like Willie are the consummate con artists.
596	00:39:00	00:39:02	They're, like, the best salesmen in the world.
597	00:39:02	00:39:07	if he was worried about losing Rachel, why wouldn't he just talk her out of it?
598	00:39:07	00:39:11	If he could talk her out of it, there'd be no reason to kill her.
599	00:39:11	00:39:12	Right.
600	00:39:12	00:39:14	So back to the Elephant Man?
601	00:39:17	00:39:20	Nope.
602	00:39:20	00:39:25	We traced the drug that killed your sister Rachel to the Clark County Zoo.
603	00:39:25	00:39:27	To you.
604	00:39:28	00:39:30	Why?
605	00:39:31	00:39:36	My daughter always worshipped Rachel.
606	00:39:36	00:39:40	Even though she was barely a part of our lives.
607	00:39:40	00:39:54	To Sylvia, Rachel was this adventurer, this nonconformist, a free spirit-- everything I wasn't, everything I wasn't allowing Sylvia to be.
608	00:39:56	00:39:58	Rachel was just a fantasy.
609	00:40:00	00:40:02	Until she wasn't.
610	00:40:02	00:40:05	She wanted to come back into our lives.
611	00:40:05	00:40:12	To insert her twisted self into our home.
612	00:40:12	00:40:17	Sh--she was having sex with that... that thing.
613	00:40:17	00:40:21	What kind of a sick person would do that?
614	00:40:21	00:40:23	She was your sister.
615	00:40:23	00:40:27	No... she wasn't.
616	00:40:27	00:40:31	She was... she was a freak.
617	00:40:31	00:40:37	I told her there was no place in our home for her.
618	00:40:37	00:40:39	But she wouldn't listen.
619	00:40:39	00:40:42	She tried to go through Sylvia to get to me.
620	00:40:42	00:40:45	She used her.
621	00:40:45	00:40:47	My own daughter.
622	00:40:47	00:40:51	Who always loved my sister more than she loved me.
623	00:40:51	00:40:53	My sister left me no choice.
624	00:40:53	00:40:56	And you left her to suffocate.
625	00:40:56	00:40:59	I did what I had to do.
626	00:41:00	00:41:03	I protected my daughter.
627	00:41:07	00:41:09	You don't understand.
628	00:41:09	00:41:11	She's the only family I have.
629	00:41:14	00:41:18	I would've done anything... anything to protect her.
630	00:41:22	00:41:25	Sylvia's safe now.
631	00:41:25	00:41:29	She's safe from the monsters in this world.
632	00:41:29	00:41:33	Yes, she is.
