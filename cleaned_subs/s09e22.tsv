0	00:00:26	00:00:28	Is that the expanded tox report?
1	00:00:28	00:00:30	Yes, it is.
2	00:00:31	00:00:35	Searched 600 metabolites and nothing unusual.
3	00:00:35	00:00:38	Makes Mr. Kelly our third undetermined in three weeks.
4	00:00:38	00:00:40	Chief coroner's gonna be on my butt.
5	00:00:40	00:00:43	Conduct a review, cut the budget.
6	00:00:43	00:00:44	I was at the scene.
7	00:00:44	00:00:49	mother came home, found him convulsing, tried CPR.
8	00:00:49	00:00:54	No prior history of seizures, only trace amounts of meth in his system, not enough to kill him.
9	00:00:54	00:00:57	Put him in the meat locker next to the other two.
10	00:00:57	00:00:59	I'm gonna figure this out.
11	00:01:06	00:01:08	I'm doing you a solid here, Doc.
12	00:01:08	00:01:14	Technically, I can't investigate until you rule Mr. Kelly's death either a homicide or suspicious circs.
13	00:01:14	00:01:16	I'll give you my tickets to Love.
14	00:01:16	00:01:18	I've seen it, twice.
15	00:01:18	00:01:20	All right. (phone ringing)
16	00:01:22	00:01:24	I've got a call-- I'll meet you up there.
17	00:01:24	00:01:27	All right!
18	00:01:41	00:01:43	Okay. Sure.
19	00:01:43	00:01:45	Mrs. Kelly, this is Catherine Willows Yeah...
20	00:01:45	00:01:46	from the Crime Lab!
21	00:01:46	00:01:48	We spoke earlier!
22	00:01:53	00:01:54	Mrs. Kelly?
23	00:01:54	00:01:56	Yeah?
24	00:01:57	00:02:01	Mrs. Kelly, I'm, uh, Catherine Willows from the Crime Lab.
25	00:02:02	00:02:03	I left you a message.
26	00:02:29	00:02:30	Catherine!
27	00:02:35	00:02:38	Catherine!
28	00:02:49	00:02:50	Catherine!
29	00:02:50	00:02:52	(pounding on door) Are you okay?!
30	00:02:55	00:02:57	Thank God.
31	00:02:57	00:02:59	She jumped me.
32	00:02:59	00:03:03	I pulled my gun and she just collapsed.
33	00:03:08	00:03:12	She's dead... and you're bleeding.
34	00:03:14	00:03:16	That's better than the other way around.
35	00:03:51	00:03:52	So I talked to the neighbors.
36	00:03:53	00:03:55	Nobody had anything bad to say about Mrs. Kelly.
37	00:03:55	00:03:56	In fact, they all called her a saint.
38	00:03:56	00:04:01	She's a special ed teacher; she's a friend to kids, stray dogs, and anybody with a problem.
39	00:04:01	00:04:03	Well, I must have met her evil clone.
40	00:04:03	00:04:04	You know, there's a reason there's a protocol.
41	00:04:04	00:04:06	You should have called me first.
42	00:04:06	00:04:08	I was doing this as a favor to Doc.
43	00:04:08	00:04:11	Yeah, this thing could have escalated easily and got out of hand.
44	00:04:12	00:04:13	Next time, you call me.
45	00:04:13	00:04:15	Yes, you're right.
46	00:04:15	00:04:17	I'm glad you're okay.
47	00:04:17	00:04:19	(sighs) Thank you.
48	00:04:19	00:04:20	How is she?
49	00:04:20	00:04:24	Vitals are stable, but the attacker bit her, and she's not sure when she had her last tetanus shot.
50	00:04:24	00:04:25	Let me see.
51	00:04:25	00:04:28	I just called you so that you could work the case 'cause I'm a witness.
52	00:04:28	00:04:29	Nick's already inside.
53	00:04:29	00:04:31	Catherine, don't be a tough guy.
54	00:04:31	00:04:33	Jeff, get her to the hospital.
55	00:04:33	00:04:34	Yes, sir.
56	00:04:45	00:04:46	Evening, Professor.
57	00:04:47	00:04:49	Nick.
58	00:05:03	00:05:07	Extending deep and heartfelt sympathies in the death of your son Brent.
59	00:05:07	00:05:10	Darla Kelly's son died six days ago.
60	00:05:10	00:05:13	Thinking that's probably what drove her over the edge.
61	00:06:10	00:06:12	Hey, check it out.
62	00:06:12	00:06:17	Found a baggy of meth in Brent's dresser and an empty one in the trash can.
63	00:06:17	00:06:18	Hmm.
64	00:06:18	00:06:22	Looks like he was a tweaker living in Mama's trailer.
65	00:06:22	00:06:27	Meth can make you stronger, meaner, angry, paranoid.
66	00:06:27	00:06:33	Maybe she was using, too, which would explain her behavior.
67	00:06:39	00:06:40	Hey.
68	00:06:40	00:06:41	I found her alive but unconscious.
69	00:06:42	00:06:43	Possible sexual assault.
70	00:06:44	00:06:46	Got an I.D.? No purse, no wallet.
71	00:06:46	00:06:48	My guys are still knocking on doors.
72	00:06:49	00:06:52	Found her pants and shoes next to the body, and the paramedics took this off her.
73	00:06:52	00:06:55	Who called it in?
74	00:06:55	00:06:56	Uh, Mr. Murphy.
75	00:06:56	00:07:00	Claims that he found her lying under his truck when he was leaving for work.
76	00:07:04	00:07:06	His wife corroborated his story.
77	00:07:06	00:07:08	We'll see if it holds up.
78	00:07:09	00:07:13	Got some abrasions on the back of the shirt.
79	00:07:13	00:07:15	Couple of buttons missing on the front.
80	00:07:22	00:07:25	White substance on the pants.
81	00:07:25	00:07:27	Could be semen.
82	00:07:27	00:07:29	Dried blood pool.
83	00:07:29	00:07:31	She was probably out here for a while.
84	00:07:31	00:07:37	Some blood drops on the box-- mostly horizontal, more than eight inches off the ground.
85	00:07:37	00:07:39	Somebody hit her when she was already down.
86	00:07:43	00:07:46	Maybe she was kicked under the truck.
87	00:07:53	00:07:55	Got a drag trail.
88	00:07:55	00:07:57	See where it leads.
89	00:08:41	00:08:43	Mrs. Kelly was such a nice lady.
90	00:08:43	00:08:46	She lost her health insurance when she went part-time at Marshall Creek Elementary.
91	00:08:46	00:08:48	Poor thing was always getting sick.
92	00:08:49	00:08:50	The warrant includes her son.
93	00:08:50	00:08:51	Was he a patient here as well?
94	00:08:51	00:08:52	Brent? Mm-hmm.
95	00:08:52	00:08:55	Yeah, he came in a few times, feigning a back injury.
96	00:08:55	00:08:57	Why is that, you think?
97	00:08:57	00:08:59	He was trying to score some oxycodone.
98	00:08:59	00:09:02	Mm. A couple weeks ago, Dr. Shaw had to forcibly remove him.
99	00:09:02	00:09:03	Really?
100	00:09:03	00:09:04	I have his file, too.
101	00:09:05	00:09:09	He was a terrible human being.
102	00:09:09	00:09:15	I used to suspect that he was abusing his mother, but when I asked Mrs. Kelly about it, she clammed right up.
103	00:09:15	00:09:23	It says here that Mrs. Kelly called the clinic three days ago complaining of flu-like symptoms, and someone told her to take an analgesic and get some rest.
104	00:09:24	00:09:25	Does that sound right?
105	00:09:25	00:09:27	Do you think that contributed to her death?
106	00:09:27	00:09:30	I don't know yet, but I'm gonna find out.
107	00:09:47	00:09:51	Dead Shrimp Blues-- Robert Johnson.
108	00:09:51	00:09:55	Recorded Friday, November 27, 1936, San Antonio, Texas.
109	00:09:55	00:09:57	The Gunter Hotel, three blocks from the Alamo.
110	00:09:57	00:09:58	You're a blues man!
111	00:09:59	00:10:00	Is fat meat greasy?
112	00:10:00	00:10:05	(laughs) I got this record in Chicago at the M.E.s' convention.
113	00:10:05	00:10:07	Guy let it go for 50 bucks.
114	00:10:07	00:10:08	The man didn't know what he had.
115	00:10:09	00:10:10	Is that the tox report?
116	00:10:10	00:10:11	Yes.
117	00:10:12	00:10:13	No drugs in her system.
118	00:10:13	00:10:14	Henry ran the panel twice.
119	00:10:14	00:10:15	I don't get it.
120	00:10:15	00:10:18	This is my fourth undetermined this month.
121	00:10:18	00:10:20	Mrs. Kelly lived with her son.
122	00:10:20	00:10:22	Maybe you're looking for some kind of pathogen.
123	00:10:22	00:10:27	Something infectious-- a virus, bacteria, microorganism?
124	00:10:27	00:10:38	I've already ruled out gonorrhea, viral hepatitis, syphilis, staphylococcus, atypical pneumonia, meningitis, endocarditis, influenza, West Nile, and SARS.
125	00:10:38	00:10:39	Then it has to be an exotic.
126	00:10:39	00:10:41	Hmm.
127	00:10:41	00:10:43	Did you hold the rest of the bodies?
128	00:10:43	00:10:45	Walk this way.
129	00:10:47	00:10:53	Brent Kelly, 22, died Friday night after an unexplained seizure.
130	00:10:53	00:11:03	Leeland Jacobs, 33, ex-con, died alone in his apartment, two weeks ago. Says here he displayed aggressive behavior prior to his death.
131	00:11:03	00:11:05	Found cocaine in his system, but he didn't OD.
132	00:11:05	00:11:11	Depending upon your genetic disposition, cocaine can trigger schizophrenia and heart failure.
133	00:11:11	00:11:12	It wasn't a heart failure.
134	00:11:12	00:11:14	I can't tell you if he was schizo.
135	00:11:14	00:11:17	We couldn't find any medical records.
136	00:11:17	00:11:18	Scotty Belinsky.
137	00:11:18	00:11:21	27. Died three weeks ago.
138	00:11:21	00:11:23	Found in his bathroom.
139	00:11:23	00:11:24	Another ex-con.
140	00:11:24	00:11:27	I had Brass run backgrounds on Belinsky and Jacobs.
141	00:11:28	00:11:29	No apparent connections.
142	00:11:29	00:11:33	Well, do we know if either of them was connected to Brent Kelly? No.
143	00:11:33	00:11:37	The only thing that brings these three men together is body modification.
144	00:11:37	00:11:39	I see Mr. Kelly had ear gauges.
145	00:11:39	00:11:40	But you ain't seen nothing yet.
146	00:11:40	00:11:43	Help me roll him.
147	00:11:47	00:11:49	That is some serious modification.
148	00:11:49	00:11:51	Transdermal implants.
149	00:11:51	00:11:53	It's done via a process called dermal punching.
150	00:11:53	00:12:04	Technician makes an incision, separates subcutis and fascia using a dermal elevator, creating a pocket where an implant's inserted-- typically steel or silicone bead.
151	00:12:04	00:12:10	The skin fuses around the bead, creating the design, kind of like a Braille tattoo.
152	00:12:10	00:12:12	So, maybe...
153	00:12:12	00:12:15	all three of these men visited the same tattoo parlor.
154	00:12:15	00:12:18	Can't be many of them that do this kind of work.
155	00:13:02	00:13:06	So, you want me to take care of that?
156	00:13:06	00:13:09	Hey, Lou, did you do a knock and talk at this house?
157	00:13:09	00:13:11	I'm just on my way over there now.
158	00:13:11	00:13:13	LVPD. Yeah, uh...
159	00:13:13	00:13:19	What's going on? Ladies, I'm Detective Vartann. This is Greg Sanders from the Crime Lab.
160	00:13:19	00:13:20	A woman was attacked on your street last night.
161	00:13:20	00:13:22	We believe the victim might have come from this house.
162	00:13:22	00:13:25	Oh, my God. Kayla.
163	00:13:25	00:13:26	She was here last night.
164	00:13:26	00:13:28	Is, uh, this Kayla?
165	00:13:31	00:13:32	Is she okay?
166	00:13:32	00:13:33	She's in the hospital.
167	00:13:34	00:13:35	What is Kayla's last name?
168	00:13:35	00:13:37	Nootens.
169	00:13:37	00:13:38	When was the last time you saw her?
170	00:13:38	00:13:39	00.
171	00:13:39	00:13:46	We had our diet club meeting, me, Diana, and Kayla. You know, we all entered the GME bikini contest.
172	00:13:46	00:13:47	GME?
173	00:13:47	00:13:49	God Made 'Em.
174	00:13:49	00:13:51	No fake boobs.
175	00:13:51	00:13:55	First prize is a trip for two to Hawaii.
176	00:13:55	00:13:56	Yeah. Well, we meet here twice a week.
177	00:13:56	00:13:59	We do our weigh in, and then we have our support dinner.
178	00:13:59	00:14:00	So, I lost another two pounds.
179	00:14:00	00:14:02	I was craving ice cream, but I went for a run instead.
180	00:14:03	00:14:05	And it worked. Rub it in, why don't you?
181	00:14:05	00:14:06	I lost zero pounds this week.
182	00:14:06	00:14:08	I'm never going to fit into my bikini.
183	00:14:08	00:14:10	Don't say that. We can do this.
184	00:14:10	00:14:11	And I am going to go to Maui.
185	00:14:11	00:14:13	If you win, will you take me?
186	00:14:16	00:14:18	00?
187	00:14:18	00:14:20	Did either of you walk her to her car?
188	00:14:20	00:14:24	I was going to drive her home, but then it stopped raining, so she decided to walk.
189	00:14:24	00:14:29	They say if you walk after dinner, it burns more fat.
190	00:14:29	00:14:30	Yeah.
191	00:14:30	00:14:34	Um, do you know anyone who might want to hurt her?
192	00:14:34	00:14:35	Her ex...
193	00:14:35	00:14:38	BF. Yeah, they fought all the time.
194	00:14:38	00:14:40	D-bag.
195	00:14:40	00:14:41	He dumped her 'cause she gained 15 pounds.
196	00:14:41	00:14:48	And then he said that he would take her back if she won the contest and took him to Hawaii. Do you know her ex-BF's name?
197	00:14:48	00:14:51	Um, Elvis Rodriguez.
198	00:14:59	00:15:02	The tetanus shot hurt more than the crazy lady attacking me.
199	00:15:02	00:15:04	You going to turn into a vampire now?
200	00:15:05	00:15:08	Well, I already work nights, so I don't think anybody's going to notice.
201	00:15:09	00:15:12	I can't work the other case, so fill me in here.
202	00:15:12	00:15:14	Doctor says death is imminent. Mmm.
203	00:15:14	00:15:16	Wet mount was positive for semen.
204	00:15:16	00:15:18	And they found signs of sexual trauma.
205	00:15:19	00:15:20	Do you want to help me roll her?
206	00:15:25	00:15:30	She's got road rash on her back, shoulders, and buttocks.
207	00:15:31	00:15:36	Based on the depth of the abrasions, it looks like she was dragged a long way.
208	00:15:36	00:15:38	That's consistent with what we found at the scene.
209	00:15:40	00:15:45	Now, this neck injury looks like a stab wound.
210	00:15:45	00:15:47	You swab it?
211	00:15:47	00:15:49	Nurse did. Found some trace inside the wound track.
212	00:15:49	00:15:51	It's with the SAE kit.
213	00:15:57	00:15:59	Excuse me!
214	00:16:18	00:16:19	He does know you can't undo that.
215	00:16:19	00:16:21	Mmm. Doesn't he?
216	00:16:21	00:16:23	Self-mutilation trips me out.
217	00:16:23	00:16:25	It's a form of rebellion.
218	00:16:25	00:16:28	I've witnessed a couple of botched tongue forkings in my time.
219	00:16:28	00:16:31	Yeah, and even if you make it through, you wind up with a...
220	00:16:31	00:16:33	speech impediment.
221	00:16:34	00:16:34	Hey, guys.
222	00:16:35	00:16:36	Walk-ins always welcome.
223	00:16:36	00:16:40	We're actually running a special right now on matching tattoo hearts.
224	00:16:40	00:16:42	Or are you guys more into rough trade?
225	00:16:42	00:16:44	Dude, we're CSI.
226	00:16:44	00:16:46	We're here on police business.
227	00:16:47	00:16:48	Are you the owner?
228	00:16:49	00:16:50	I wish.
229	00:16:50	00:16:53	It's Jack's Body Shop, and my name is Eric.
230	00:16:53	00:16:54	Eric Tobin.
231	00:16:54	00:16:57	I'm the manager slash receptionist.
232	00:16:57	00:16:59	The man-ceptionist.
233	00:17:01	00:17:03	We need to speak with Jack.
234	00:17:03	00:17:06	Jack is in the back making one of his magic potions.
235	00:17:06	00:17:08	Thank you, my man.
236	00:17:14	00:17:18	Boy, this is all kinds of wrong.
237	00:17:24	00:17:27	Bathroom's in the front.
238	00:17:27	00:17:29	Are you Jack?
239	00:17:29	00:17:31	Crime Lab boys.
240	00:17:31	00:17:34	Dr. Jack Shaw. What can I do for you, gentlemen?
241	00:17:34	00:17:37	Are you the same Dr. Shaw that works the free clinic on Janville?
242	00:17:38	00:17:39	Guilty.
243	00:17:40	00:17:42	I assume you also know I'm a retired coroner from Reno.
244	00:17:42	00:17:44	I do now.
245	00:17:44	00:17:48	So, how'd you go from being a coroner to owning this place?
246	00:17:48	00:17:50	Natural transition, actually.
247	00:17:50	00:17:53	Used to spend all day cutting up dead bodies and sticking them with needles.
248	00:17:53	00:17:55	Today when I cut 'em, they bleed.
249	00:17:56	00:18:02	Tell me, Doctor, do you know if any of these men has been in your shop recently?
250	00:18:02	00:18:06	I don't recognize the faces, but I do know the work.
251	00:18:06	00:18:09	There's sunflower yellow and iris blue in these tats.
252	00:18:09	00:18:11	That's Van Gogh. He mixes his own ink.
253	00:18:11	00:18:13	And he's the only one that does dermal implants.
254	00:18:13	00:18:14	What's his real name?
255	00:18:14	00:18:16	Carl Van Goe. Spelled G-O-E.
256	00:18:16	00:18:18	I swear to God.
257	00:18:18	00:18:19	Had it legally changed.
258	00:18:19	00:18:21	I fired him two weeks ago.
259	00:18:21	00:18:22	How come?
260	00:18:22	00:18:23	Artistic differences.
261	00:18:23	00:18:26	Customer would want a certain design.
262	00:18:26	00:18:29	Van Goe would give them what he thought was right for their canvas.
263	00:18:33	00:18:36	You guys going to tell me what's going on?
264	00:18:36	00:18:39	These three men all died of an infectious disease.
265	00:18:39	00:18:43	Seems that this place-- your shop-- is the only common link.
266	00:18:43	00:18:44	Hey, I run a clean shop.
267	00:18:44	00:18:48	I give an antibiotic shot to anybody that's had an invasive procedure.
268	00:18:48	00:18:51	But Van Goe brings his own tools and needles.
269	00:18:51	00:18:53	We'd like to check him out.
270	00:18:53	00:18:58	In the meantime, we're going to need your tools, needles, inks, and, uh, the biohazard bin.
271	00:18:58	00:18:59	Supply cabinet's up front.
272	00:19:00	00:19:01	Biohazard's out back.
273	00:19:01	00:19:03	It's all in the warrant.
274	00:19:05	00:19:06	Uh, what pathogen do you suspect?
275	00:19:07	00:19:08	Did I say it was a pathogen?
276	00:19:08	00:19:09	Retired coroner.
277	00:19:10	00:19:11	I'm assuming.
278	00:19:14	00:19:16	So, Elvis, how'd you get these injuries?
279	00:19:16	00:19:17	I'm a landscaper.
280	00:19:17	00:19:20	Got a lot of cactus orders 'cause of the drought.
281	00:19:20	00:19:23	Or maybe they're from when you raped your ex, Kayla Nootens.
282	00:19:24	00:19:25	I didn't rape Kay.
283	00:19:25	00:19:26	We had sex.
284	00:19:26	00:19:27	Open up.
285	00:19:27	00:19:30	You had the kind of sex where she said no.
286	00:19:30	00:19:31	Hold up. This is crazy.
287	00:19:31	00:19:32	Me and Kay broke up. Yeah.
288	00:19:32	00:19:34	Because you thought she was fat.
289	00:19:34	00:19:35	You ever seen her?
290	00:19:35	00:19:37	She used to look like a little coke bottle.
291	00:19:37	00:19:38	Then she got all messy in the middle.
292	00:19:38	00:19:40	I couldn't have that on my arm.
293	00:19:40	00:19:42	So, when Kayla dropped a few l.b.'s, you wanted her back?
294	00:19:42	00:19:44	No, remember, he wanted a free trip to Hawaii.
295	00:19:44	00:19:46	Oh, right. That's why I had sex with her.
296	00:19:46	00:19:47	To seal the deal.
297	00:19:47	00:19:48	She was easy that way.
298	00:19:48	00:19:50	And I needed a vacay.
299	00:19:50	00:19:51	What time was this?
300	00:19:51	00:19:53	00 maybe.
301	00:19:53	00:19:57	Then she went to go see some friends, and I had to go pick up my new girlfriend's kid from day care.
302	00:19:58	00:20:00	Where did you go after?
303	00:20:00	00:20:02	I dropped the kid off, but my girlfriend was tired.
304	00:20:02	00:20:03	So I went home.
305	00:20:03	00:20:05	Well, that means you don't have an alibi.
306	00:20:05	00:20:07	Why do I need an alibi for?
307	00:20:07	00:20:10	Because I'm charging you with the rape and murder of Kayla Nootens.
308	00:20:10	00:20:12	Congratulations.
309	00:20:12	00:20:15	You may have just won a 20-year vacay.
310	00:20:20	00:20:24	(beeps) Hello, this is-- Don't say hello.
311	00:20:26	00:20:27	Okay.
312	00:20:27	00:20:33	This is the first solo autopsy of Assistant Medical Examiner David Gregory Phillips.
313	00:20:33	00:20:35	Me.
314	00:20:35	00:20:38	Decedent is a Caucasian female.
315	00:20:38	00:20:39	Kayla Nootens.
316	00:20:39	00:20:41	Early 20s.
317	00:20:41	00:20:42	63 inches.
318	00:20:42	00:20:44	144 pounds. (beep)
319	00:20:52	00:20:55	I don't have C.O.D. yet, so please don't ask.
320	00:20:55	00:20:56	You want some help? No.
321	00:20:56	00:20:58	I have to do this myself.
322	00:20:58	00:20:59	It's my first solo.
323	00:21:01	00:21:02	Sorry.
324	00:21:03	00:21:04	Didn't mean to lose my temper.
325	00:21:04	00:21:06	That was you losing your temper?
326	00:21:06	00:21:09	My wife calls me a snapping alligator.
327	00:21:10	00:21:13	Well, your bad temper is better than my good one.
328	00:21:13	00:21:14	Did you examine her neck wound?
329	00:21:14	00:21:16	Of course I did.
330	00:21:16	00:21:18	She was stabbed.
331	00:21:18	00:21:19	I excised that from the wound.
332	00:21:19	00:21:21	What is it? I have no idea.
333	00:21:21	00:21:23	Maybe you could ask Hodges.
334	00:21:28	00:21:32	So, Mr. Van Goe, how come you still have both your ears?
335	00:21:32	00:21:34	Got the name 'cause I cut off someone's ear lobe.
336	00:21:34	00:21:35	Accident.
337	00:21:35	00:21:37	It was my first year on the job.
338	00:21:37	00:21:38	Of course.
339	00:21:38	00:21:41	So, where do you keep all your tools?
340	00:21:41	00:21:42	No, hey, hey, hey.
341	00:21:42	00:21:43	Where do you think you're going?
342	00:21:43	00:21:44	No.
343	00:21:44	00:21:45	He'll go look.
344	00:21:45	00:21:49	I need you to stay here and paint me a picture.
345	00:21:51	00:21:54	Did you do any work on these guys at Jack's Body Shop?
346	00:21:54	00:21:57	I don't know. Why don't you ask Jack? I quit.
347	00:21:57	00:22:00	So, you telling me that Shaw didn't fire you?
348	00:22:00	00:22:02	He's a jackal and a philistine.
349	00:22:02	00:22:05	I quit. I took my clients with me.
350	00:22:05	00:22:07	I'm going to need a list of your clients.
351	00:22:07	00:22:08	I don't write anything down.
352	00:22:09	00:22:10	Excuse me, Mr. Van Goe.
353	00:22:10	00:22:12	You been working out of your shed these days?
354	00:22:13	00:22:16	You do know that's against the law, don't you?
355	00:22:16	00:22:17	Okay, let's start again.
356	00:22:17	00:22:18	Did you work on any of these guys?
357	00:22:18	00:22:20	Either here, there, or anywhere?
358	00:22:20	00:22:23	Maybe. No, this is not multiple choice.
359	00:22:23	00:22:24	It's either yes or no.
360	00:22:24	00:22:26	Or.
361	00:22:26	00:22:27	Okay, it's gonna be one of those days, I guess.
362	00:22:27	00:22:28	All right, look, Scotty, wrap him up.
363	00:22:28	00:22:29	Come on, let's go.
364	00:22:29	00:22:32	We'll do this some other place.
365	00:22:46	00:22:48	Damn it.
366	00:22:48	00:22:52	Virology results from the tattoo parlor.
367	00:22:52	00:22:55	No detectable contaminants, poisons or pathogens.
368	00:22:55	00:22:57	Maybe something will turn up in the Van Goe shed.
369	00:22:57	00:22:59	Can we go over it one more time?
370	00:22:59	00:23:01	Yeah.
371	00:23:01	00:23:04	Starting with the most recent victim.
372	00:23:05	00:23:08	Darla Kelly gave her dying son CPR.
373	00:23:08	00:23:12	Three days later she complains of a sore throat, fatigue and a low-grade fever.
374	00:23:12	00:23:15	Three days after that, she attacks Catherine and drops dead.
375	00:23:15	00:23:20	Right, her counts are normal, white blood cells unaffected, which tells us it's not bacterial.
376	00:23:20	00:23:22	If it's not in the blood, it has to be the tissue.
377	00:23:22	00:23:25	Certain organisms have different rates of crossing the blood-brain barrier.
378	00:23:25	00:23:27	Histology was negative.
379	00:23:27	00:23:31	Muscle, tissue, brain, organs.
380	00:23:31	00:23:33	But the lab only checked for common pathogens.
381	00:23:33	00:23:37	Let's take a look at Darla Kelly's brain tissue.
382	00:23:38	00:23:40	Bottom right quadrant.
383	00:23:40	00:23:41	Is that a Negri body?
384	00:23:41	00:23:43	That's what I'm thinking.
385	00:23:43	00:23:45	I haven't seen one of those since medical school.
386	00:24:00	00:24:02	I have another one here, Doctor.
387	00:24:02	00:24:05	There are Negri bodies in each victim's brain tissue.
388	00:24:08	00:24:09	It's rabies. Yes.
389	00:24:09	00:24:14	No one's died of rabies in Nevada in over 90 years, and now we have four in a month.
390	00:24:14	00:24:18	Rabies would explain Darla Kelly's flu-like symptoms.
391	00:24:18	00:24:20	It was raining that night.
392	00:24:20	00:24:22	Rabies can cause hydrophobia, intense fear of water.
393	00:24:22	00:24:25	Maybe it triggered her violent behavior.
394	00:24:25	00:24:26	And rabies is carried in the saliva.
395	00:24:26	00:24:28	Mrs. Kelly had a cold sore.
396	00:24:28	00:24:38	The virus travels through connective tissue into the muscle, goes up into the neuronal cells of the brain stem and into the limbic cortex.
397	00:24:38	00:24:47	The most common form of rabies virus transmission is through the bite or the virus-containing saliva of an infected host, which is almost always a rabid animal.
398	00:24:47	00:24:52	Now, none of the victims had bite marks, and no one reported being bitten.
399	00:24:53	00:24:55	Someone was bitten.
400	00:24:55	00:24:56	Catherine.
401	00:25:03	00:25:05	What's wrong?
402	00:25:05	00:25:08	Uh, we have C.O.D. on Darla Kelly.
403	00:25:08	00:25:09	It's rabies.
404	00:25:12	00:25:15	Okay, uh, so, what?
405	00:25:15	00:25:17	I'll get a shot and be fine.
406	00:25:17	00:25:20	Human rabies cases are very rare.
407	00:25:20	00:25:25	The treatment is extremely expensive, which is why the state doesn't have any available.
408	00:25:25	00:25:30	Okay, so, you're telling me that there aren't any available shots in the entire state of Nevada?!
409	00:25:31	00:25:36	If the treatment is administered within the first 72 hours of transmission, you should be fine.
410	00:25:36	00:25:37	It's already been more than 24.
411	00:25:37	00:25:39	And we've located a supply; it's in Atlanta.
412	00:25:40	00:25:42	Atlanta?! Georgia.
413	00:25:42	00:25:44	You'll need a test to confirm whether you've got it.
414	00:25:44	00:25:47	And I'm taking you to the hospital right now.
415	00:25:47	00:25:50	I... I need to call Nick.
416	00:25:50	00:25:51	Let him know he's the acting supervisor.
417	00:25:51	00:25:52	Use your cell phone.
418	00:26:09	00:26:12	At least give me a hint. I wish I could.
419	00:26:12	00:26:15	But Dr. Robbins has to review and sign off on my work first.
420	00:26:15	00:26:16	Okay, well, where is he?
421	00:26:16	00:26:17	The hospital.
422	00:26:17	00:26:18	Visiting Catherine.
423	00:26:18	00:26:21	He must be feeling really guilty.
424	00:26:25	00:26:30	Okay, the rape victim who was dragged. Uh, Kayla Nootens.
425	00:26:30	00:26:31	Go.
426	00:26:31	00:26:36	Okay, uh, decedent sustained a half-inch deep stab wound to the right side of her neck.
427	00:26:36	00:26:38	It nicked her vertebral artery.
428	00:26:38	00:26:40	C.O.D. is exsanguination.
429	00:26:40	00:26:42	This wound is minor, David.
430	00:26:42	00:26:43	She's a young woman.
431	00:26:44	00:26:45	Blood would have clotted within minutes.
432	00:26:45	00:26:51	Yes, sir, however, I discovered that she was severely anemic and had excessive levels of caffeine in her system.
433	00:26:51	00:26:55	Both of which contributed to blood thinning and compromised her clotting factors.
434	00:26:55	00:26:57	Common indicators of anorexia.
435	00:26:57	00:26:59	Or extreme dieting.
436	00:26:59	00:27:02	Her and her friends were trying to win a bikini contest.
437	00:27:03	00:27:08	So, my proposed C.O.D. is exsanguination with additional complicating factors preventing clotting.
438	00:27:10	00:27:11	Well described.
439	00:27:11	00:27:13	I concur.
440	00:27:17	00:27:20	Catherine just got her prophylaxis shots.
441	00:27:20	00:27:22	She's doing fine.
442	00:27:22	00:27:23	That's good to hear.
443	00:27:23	00:27:25	What have you got?
444	00:27:25	00:27:33	Well, virology confirmed that all four victims died of a, uh, rabies virus variant associated with T. Brasiliensis.
445	00:27:33	00:27:35	The Mexican Free Tailed Bat.
446	00:27:35	00:27:38	We didn't find any evidence of bats at the mobile home park.
447	00:27:38	00:27:41	And two of the victims died in apartments off the strip.
448	00:27:41	00:27:45	So, what's our theory?
449	00:27:45	00:27:48	I mean, did all these people go spelunking in Lehman Caves or what?
450	00:27:48	00:27:50	They charge admission there.
451	00:27:50	00:27:53	So, I checked their guest books and their receipts.
452	00:27:53	00:27:54	None of our victims were there.
453	00:27:54	00:27:58	I called CDC, I asked for all their files on rabies transmissions.
454	00:27:58	00:28:02	Most of it was, uh, straight-up hunter bitten by fox stuff.
455	00:28:02	00:28:04	But this one did stand out.
456	00:28:04	00:28:06	That's redacted.
457	00:28:06	00:28:09	That usually means there was a lawsuit with a confidential settlement.
458	00:28:09	00:28:13	Doc Robbins says there hasn't been a rabies death in Nevada in nearly a century.
459	00:28:13	00:28:16	But from what I can piece together, that may not be true.
460	00:28:16	00:28:21	A patient up in Reno tested positive for rabies after a liver transplant.
461	00:28:21	00:28:23	But doesn't say if she died or not.
462	00:28:23	00:28:25	If her liver was infected, she's dead.
463	00:28:25	00:28:32	If the donor was local, that means that the Reno Coroner had to clear the body before they could harvest the organs.
464	00:28:32	00:28:35	I guess he must've missed it.
465	00:28:35	00:28:38	Yeah.
466	00:28:38	00:28:39	What about Dr. Shaw?
467	00:28:39	00:28:40	He's a coroner.
468	00:28:40	00:28:43	I know this happened three years ago.
469	00:28:43	00:28:47	I don't know how many they had working in Reno back then, but we do know him.
470	00:28:47	00:28:52	Brent Kelly, Scott Belinsky and Leeland Jacobs all went to this guy's tattoo parlor.
471	00:28:52	00:28:56	And both the Kellys were treated by him at the Free Clinic.
472	00:28:56	00:28:57	Your victim was a messy eater.
473	00:28:57	00:28:59	Not too proficient with a fork.
474	00:28:59	00:29:03	The white substance on the clothes is not semen.
475	00:29:03	00:29:06	It's potatoes, butter, milk and a pinch of garlic.
476	00:29:06	00:29:08	Mashed potatoes? Mm-hmm.
477	00:29:09	00:29:11	She was cheating on her diet.
478	00:29:11	00:29:12	More like a food orgy.
479	00:29:13	00:29:17	The trace on the neck wound showed apple, cinnamon and grease.
480	00:29:17	00:29:19	What about the fragment David extracted?
481	00:29:19	00:29:21	Well, that would be the main course.
482	00:29:21	00:29:22	It was animal bone.
483	00:29:23	00:29:27	Although it was too small for me to identify the species, I think we know it's pretty obvious.
484	00:29:29	00:29:31	Babe.
485	00:29:31	00:29:32	Wilbur?
486	00:29:33	00:29:35	Pork.
487	00:29:35	00:29:36	Yes, the other white meat.
488	00:29:36	00:29:39	That's the only type of flesh that you would season that way.
489	00:29:40	00:29:42	Suddenly, I'm very hungry.
490	00:29:42	00:29:43	Break time.
491	00:29:44	00:29:46	Hold on there, spuds.
492	00:29:46	00:29:48	How much do you weigh?
493	00:29:48	00:29:49	Uh, excuse you.
494	00:29:50	00:29:50	That's not public information.
495	00:29:51	00:29:54	I'd say a buck 45.
496	00:29:54	00:29:56	Same as our victim.
497	00:29:56	00:30:01	We know Kayla Nootens was dragged face-up because her back was abraded.
498	00:30:01	00:30:06	So, if the killer dragged her like this...
499	00:30:06	00:30:07	Her back wouldn't be abraded.
500	00:30:08	00:30:12	Right. Okay, what if the killer dragged her like this?
501	00:30:12	00:30:13	Ow, hey!
502	00:30:14	00:30:16	Easy, killer.
503	00:30:16	00:30:18	Hodges' calves are touching the floor.
504	00:30:18	00:30:20	Vic had no abrasions from the knees down.
505	00:30:20	00:30:23	There must've been two of them.
506	00:30:28	00:30:30	Yep.
507	00:30:30	00:30:32	Elvis had a friend.
508	00:30:32	00:30:36	Um... if I may...
509	00:30:36	00:30:43	Wouldn't two men, one of whom being a cactus-hauling desert landscaper, just be able to pick me up and carry me?
510	00:30:43	00:30:44	Or... her?
511	00:30:45	00:30:48	First rule of diet club...
512	00:30:48	00:30:50	Don't talk about diet club.
513	00:30:50	00:30:51	The whole thing was Rhonda's fault.
514	00:30:51	00:30:54	She was sabotaging Kayla's diet because she'd lost the most weight.
515	00:30:54	00:30:56	That is so not true!
516	00:30:56	00:30:58	Kayla was fatter than me.
517	00:30:58	00:31:00	So, of course she lost more weight.
518	00:31:00	00:31:03	Anyway, Kayla is the one that started it.
519	00:31:03	00:31:05	These mashed potatoes are amazing.
520	00:31:05	00:31:06	What kind of butter substitute did you use?
521	00:31:07	00:31:08	Mine suck.
522	00:31:14	00:31:15	Hers are watery.
523	00:31:15	00:31:17	Oh, my God.
524	00:31:17	00:31:18	You bitch.
525	00:31:21	00:31:24	You are the bitch!
526	00:31:24	00:31:28	You were going to ditch me for your ugly ex-BF and take him to Hawaii!
527	00:31:28	00:31:30	You're both bitches!
528	00:31:31	00:31:35	Kayla would still be alive if Rhonda hadn't whipped that pork chop at her.
529	00:31:47	00:31:49	You are going to jail!
530	00:31:49	00:31:53	And you will always have a fat ass!
531	00:31:53	00:31:56	Rhonda lost it, chased her down.
532	00:31:58	00:31:59	She dropped dead right there.
533	00:31:59	00:32:03	I didn't know that you could kill somebody with a pork chop.
534	00:32:03	00:32:08	But it was Diana's idea to drag the body under the truck and then pin the whole thing on Elvis.
535	00:32:22	00:32:27	Kayla wasn't dead when you were kicking her under the truck.
536	00:32:27	00:32:31	She bled to death because you left her there.
537	00:32:38	00:32:40	I'm telling you, I didn't kill anybody.
538	00:32:40	00:32:41	Okay, we got it, Doc, let's go.
539	00:32:41	00:32:42	Want me to call your girlfriend? Hey, hey, hey!
540	00:32:42	00:32:43	Back off, back off.
541	00:32:43	00:32:45	Hey, I got your back, I believe you!
542	00:32:45	00:32:47	Stay strong.
543	00:32:47	00:32:49	Hey, take it easy. (groans)
544	00:32:50	00:32:51	Call 911.
545	00:32:53	00:32:54	Hey, bud.
546	00:32:54	00:32:55	Huh? Hey, bud.
547	00:32:55	00:32:56	Did I just pass out again?
548	00:32:57	00:32:58	Stay, stay back.
549	00:32:59	00:33:00	How you feeling?
550	00:33:00	00:33:01	I'm fine.
551	00:33:01	00:33:04	I just... I haven't been feeling too good since I got my nipples pierced.
552	00:33:05	00:33:09	Dr. Shaw gave me a shot of antibiotics, but I probably just got an infection anyway.
553	00:33:09	00:33:10	When did you get the shot?
554	00:33:10	00:33:12	A couple days ago.
555	00:33:22	00:33:24	I don't know-- it's a setup.
556	00:33:24	00:33:25	Who framed you?
557	00:33:25	00:33:27	Roger Rabbit? Maybe Van Goe.
558	00:33:27	00:33:28	He's a crazy bastard.
559	00:33:28	00:33:30	He threatened me when I fired him.
560	00:33:30	00:33:31	So, how does this frame-up play out?
561	00:33:31	00:33:36	Van Goe breaks into your shop wearing a Dr. Shaw mask and pokes Tobin with a rabid needle?
562	00:33:36	00:33:38	I'm not denying I gave Eric an antibiotic shot.
563	00:33:38	00:33:41	He had a piercing-- that's SOP at my shop.
564	00:33:41	00:33:43	You know, somebody's lying in this room.
565	00:33:43	00:33:46	And it's not me, and it's not him, 'cause he just got here.
566	00:33:50	00:33:57	Three years ago, in Reno, a transplant recipient died from a donor liver that tested positive for rabies.
567	00:33:57	00:33:59	I was the M.E.
568	00:33:59	00:34:00	on the donor's autopsy.
569	00:34:00	00:34:01	I ruled it a natural.
570	00:34:01	00:34:02	There was an investigation.
571	00:34:02	00:34:03	I was cleared.
572	00:34:03	00:34:06	Rabies detection is not part of the organ review.
573	00:34:06	00:34:09	So, this isn't your first dance around the rabies game.
574	00:34:09	00:34:11	Did you give the donor an antibiotic shot, too?
575	00:34:11	00:34:17	The victim's family later admitted that he had been bitten by a raccoon six weeks before he died.
576	00:34:17	00:34:20	Well, maybe Rocky Raccoon framed you.
577	00:34:20	00:34:23	I'd like to end this interview and call a lawyer.
578	00:35:00	00:35:02	Miss Schiff?
579	00:35:02	00:35:03	Hi. Hi.
580	00:35:03	00:35:04	Can I help you with something?
581	00:35:04	00:35:06	Uh, no, but I think I can help you.
582	00:35:06	00:35:08	I found this in the trash at Dr. Shaw's house.
583	00:35:08	00:35:11	What were you doing at his house?
584	00:35:11	00:35:12	Mr. Stokes, I'm...
585	00:35:12	00:35:15	embarrassed to admit it, but we were dating.
586	00:35:15	00:35:17	I-I didn't see it.
587	00:35:17	00:35:20	I had no idea that he's this monster.
588	00:35:20	00:35:21	I saw him take it out of his briefcase.
589	00:35:21	00:35:23	These are the same bags we use at the clinic.
590	00:35:23	00:35:25	I don't think it belongs to a patient.
591	00:35:25	00:35:26	Did you ask him about it?
592	00:35:26	00:35:29	He gets angry if I ask him any questions.
593	00:35:29	00:35:32	Just please don't tell him that I gave it to you.
594	00:35:32	00:35:34	All right.
595	00:35:34	00:35:36	Thanks.
596	00:35:38	00:35:39	(clears throat) Hi.
597	00:35:40	00:35:43	I need to know what this is, and then get the bag to Prints right away.
598	00:35:43	00:35:46	Well, it looks like it's some kind of tissue.
599	00:35:46	00:35:48	Yeah, you might want to double-glove.
600	00:35:48	00:35:53	I think Dr. Shaw's been cutting up rabid animals, making some sort of a rabies potion.
601	00:35:55	00:35:58	I will sample DNA and run a species determination.
602	00:35:58	00:36:02	Also, I found Eric Tobin's needle, and virology confirmed that it tested positive for rabies.
603	00:36:02	00:36:04	Any DNA on the syringe? Yeah.
604	00:36:04	00:36:08	I just don't know if it's a match to Shaw yet 'cause Langston just dropped off the exemplar on his way out of town.
605	00:36:09	00:36:11	Out of town?
606	00:36:16	00:36:18	Did you tell Nick what we're doing?
607	00:36:18	00:36:22	I did not tell Nick what we were doing, just in case things don't go according to plan.
608	00:36:22	00:36:23	Gives him plausible deniability.
609	00:36:23	00:36:25	Correct.
610	00:36:25	00:36:28	You know, we're kind of screwed if the hospital doesn't have hard copies of the documents.
611	00:36:28	00:36:29	Mm-hmm.
612	00:36:30	00:36:34	Good thing being a doctor has more advantages than just getting hot chicks.
613	00:36:38	00:36:40	Is that Mississippi John Hurt?
614	00:36:40	00:36:41	No.
615	00:36:43	00:36:46	Recorded January, 1932.
616	00:36:46	00:36:47	Grafton, Wisconsin.
617	00:36:47	00:36:49	Shoot me a title.
618	00:36:49	00:36:53	My dear doctor, we are traveling to Reno on the Gone Dead Train.
619	00:36:54	00:36:56	King Solomon Hill. Ah.
620	00:36:56	00:36:57	Born...
621	00:36:58	00:37:00	Joe Holmes. Thank you.
622	00:37:07	00:37:08	Hello. Hello.
623	00:37:08	00:37:10	Uh, Frank, how are you today?
624	00:37:10	00:37:12	Never seen you guys before.
625	00:37:12	00:37:14	Are you attendings or surgeons?
626	00:37:14	00:37:17	Yeah, we're from, uh, Saint Ann's.
627	00:37:17	00:37:20	Uh, we're doing research for the, uh...
628	00:37:20	00:37:22	for the cardinal.
629	00:37:22	00:37:23	Not the, uh, team in Arizona.
630	00:37:23	00:37:26	The, uh, guy who wears the pointy red hat, cardinal.
631	00:37:26	00:37:28	Medical I.D.'s, please.
632	00:37:30	00:37:39	You're not allowed to remove any files from this room, photocopy any files without permission, mutilate or destroy any files.
633	00:37:39	00:37:40	Got it...
634	00:37:41	00:37:42	Ebony and Ivory?
635	00:37:43	00:37:45	Yeah, we...
636	00:37:45	00:37:47	we got it, Frank.
637	00:37:50	00:37:51	Next time, you don't talk.
638	00:37:51	00:37:53	I don't talk? I don't think you should talk.
639	00:37:53	00:37:56	So, we have a liver transplant.
640	00:37:56	00:37:58	Recipient was Sandra Williams.
641	00:37:58	00:38:01	This patient did well immediately after transplantation.
642	00:38:01	00:38:05	Discharged on postoperative day five.
643	00:38:05	00:38:11	21 days after transplant, she was readmitted with tremors, lethargy and anorexia.
644	00:38:12	00:38:16	During the next 48 hours, her mental status deteriorated.
645	00:38:16	00:38:17	She subsequently died.
646	00:38:17	00:38:19	Initial diagnosis was encephalitis. Hmm.
647	00:38:19	00:38:29	Well, it says here that the recipient's husband, Eric Tobin, filed a lawsuit against the hospital and its medical personnel.
648	00:38:29	00:38:30	Not surprising.
649	00:38:30	00:38:32	Did you say Eric Tobin?
650	00:38:32	00:38:33	Mm-hmm.
651	00:38:33	00:38:38	It's, uh, Jack's Body Shop, and my name is Eric-- Eric Tobin.
652	00:38:38	00:38:43	What, you don't think he's some sort of mastermind that framed Dr. Shaw, do you?
653	00:38:43	00:38:44	I mean, come on, Ray, you met him.
654	00:38:44	00:38:46	He's not even the master of his own mind.
655	00:38:46	00:38:47	He has motive, Nick.
656	00:38:47	00:38:49	He blames Shaw for his wife's death.
657	00:38:49	00:38:51	Tobin won a malpractice suit.
658	00:38:51	00:38:52	That's big bucks.
659	00:38:52	00:38:55	The only reason he'd work at the shop is for revenge.
660	00:38:55	00:38:59	Well, gentlemen, all of the physical evidence points to Dr. Shaw.
661	00:38:59	00:39:02	Wendy found his touch DNA on the syringe that infected Tobin.
662	00:39:02	00:39:12	And while you two were out playing Smokey and the Bandit, his girlfriend, who's also a nurse at the clinic, brought me something he was trying a salivary gland from a rabid bat.
663	00:39:12	00:39:15	I think that's what he used to make the virus.
664	00:39:15	00:39:22	Rabid bats are easy to spot because they stay within reach, even when a human enters their cave.
665	00:39:22	00:39:28	All he had to do was extract the saliva and add a preservative to keep the rabies virus viable.
666	00:39:28	00:39:33	Look, I don't know how Tobin plays into all this, but Shaw is still our best suspect.
667	00:39:33	00:39:39	Besides, it takes technical skill and knowledge to extract the rabies virus like that.
668	00:39:39	00:39:42	Then Tobin isn't working alone.
669	00:39:42	00:39:43	He's partnered with a mastermind.
670	00:39:44	00:39:47	You said Shaw's girlfriend is a nurse, and she brought you that evidence.
671	00:39:47	00:39:49	I'm suspicious of anybody who brings me anything.
672	00:39:49	00:39:52	I ran Susan Schiff through the system.
673	00:39:52	00:39:53	There was no criminal record.
674	00:39:53	00:39:55	She could still be lying.
675	00:39:55	00:39:56	Maybe there's another connection.
676	00:39:56	00:39:59	Did Susan Schiff live in Reno?
677	00:39:59	00:40:00	Run her Social.
678	00:40:19	00:40:21	Susan Schiff...
679	00:40:21	00:40:23	also known as Susan Williams.
680	00:40:23	00:40:25	The woman who died in Reno...
681	00:40:25	00:40:28	her name was Sandra Williams.
682	00:40:28	00:40:31	My daughter was on the transplant list for a year.
683	00:40:31	00:40:34	Sandy was so excited when her name finally came up.
684	00:40:34	00:40:36	She and Eric started planning for their future.
685	00:40:36	00:40:39	She wanted to have a baby.
686	00:40:39	00:40:44	But because of Dr. Shaw and his negligence, what she got was 21 days of hell.
687	00:40:44	00:40:45	You ever seen somebody die of rabies?
688	00:40:45	00:40:48	I've seen people die all kinds of ways.
689	00:40:48	00:40:55	I understand he made a fatal mistake-- I really do-- but that doesn't give you the right to kill four innocent people.
690	00:40:55	00:40:57	Those men weren't innocent.
691	00:40:57	00:40:59	They were a different kind of virus.
692	00:40:59	00:41:04	I told you when we met, Brent Kelly was a low-life drug dealer who beat up his own mother.
693	00:41:04	00:41:06	And the other two, Eric chose.
694	00:41:06	00:41:12	Those guys would come into the shop and brag about selling drugs to kids and having sex with minors.
695	00:41:12	00:41:15	Where were you guys?
696	00:41:15	00:41:16	You know, I'm a little confused, Batman.
697	00:41:16	00:41:20	Was your mission to avenge your wife's death or rid Gotham of scumbags?
698	00:41:20	00:41:21	What about Darla Kelly?
699	00:41:21	00:41:24	She was innocent.
700	00:41:24	00:41:25	I thought you liked her.
701	00:41:26	00:41:27	That one's on Brent.
702	00:41:27	00:41:29	I always knew he'd kill her someday.
703	00:41:29	00:41:31	What about your son-in-law?
704	00:41:31	00:41:32	I volunteered.
705	00:41:32	00:41:33	You hadn't arrested Shaw yet.
706	00:41:34	00:41:35	Plus...
707	00:41:35	00:41:38	Sue wasn't going to let me die.
708	00:41:38	00:41:39	I'm not stupid.
709	00:41:39	00:41:40	Not anymore.
710	00:41:40	00:41:41	How did you pull it off?
711	00:41:41	00:41:43	I got a piercing.
712	00:41:45	00:41:48	I knew that Dr. Shaw would give me a shot of antibiotics.
713	00:41:48	00:41:49	That's his SOP.
714	00:41:49	00:41:52	Sue gave me a vial of the virus.
715	00:41:52	00:41:54	I slapped on a label.
716	00:41:54	00:42:00	Susan, you don't get to play God because your daughter died-- that's not the way it works.
717	00:42:00	00:42:03	Dr. Shaw didn't just kill my little girl.
718	00:42:03	00:42:05	He killed my whole family.
719	00:42:05	00:42:08	My sons, my parents, my marriage.
720	00:42:08	00:42:09	Eric.
721	00:42:09	00:42:12	We all died that day.
722	00:42:12	00:42:15	And Dr. Shaw didn't lose anything.
723	00:42:15	00:42:18	And that's just wrong.
724	00:42:25	00:42:27	You wanted to see me.
725	00:42:27	00:42:29	Wanted to thank you.
726	00:42:29	00:42:30	What for?
727	00:42:30	00:42:32	For believing in my innocence.
728	00:42:32	00:42:35	I just didn't assume you were guilty.
729	00:42:36	00:42:40	You know, I was good-- really good-- at my job.
730	00:42:40	00:42:42	I just wasn't good enough.
731	00:42:42	00:42:44	I understand, Doctor.
732	00:42:44	00:42:46	I've been there.
733	00:43:09	00:43:11	Remember that solid you owe me?
734	00:43:13	00:43:16	It's going to take more than show tickets, isn't it?
735	00:43:17	00:43:18	Oh, yeah.
