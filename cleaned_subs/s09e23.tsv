0	00:00:41	00:00:43	Ready for a good night?
1	00:00:43	00:00:44	You know I am, baby.
2	00:00:51	00:00:54	Watch out, fellas. Watch out.
3	00:00:54	00:00:55	Hey, Rudy!
4	00:00:55	00:00:57	How's it going, brother?
5	00:00:57	00:00:59	Hook us up with two.
6	00:01:00	00:01:01	Here you go, Joey.
7	00:01:06	00:01:08	Yo, Death! You wanna shoot?
8	00:01:08	00:01:10	I'm broke.
9	00:01:10	00:01:12	I'll spot you, brother.
10	00:01:12	00:01:13	Ha-ha, brother!
11	00:01:14	00:01:15	Huh!
12	00:01:20	00:01:24	Joey, check it out.
13	00:01:24	00:01:26	Talk about easy rider.
14	00:01:26	00:01:30	Hey, you got a ride like this, man, you got to stay on it.
15	00:01:40	00:01:42	I'm going to kick your ass, Hooper!
16	00:01:47	00:01:49	It's all family love here.
17	00:01:51	00:01:53	Come on, Jackass, Get in there!
18	00:02:24	00:02:27	Let me see your hands! Up!
19	00:02:27	00:02:29	Let's go, keep it moving.
20	00:02:30	00:02:32	So, a radio car was in the neighborhood.
21	00:02:32	00:02:34	Picked up a 911 call from dispatch.
22	00:02:34	00:02:37	A 911 call for a biker bar fight?
23	00:02:37	00:02:38	(chuckles) Did you run the number?
24	00:02:38	00:02:40	Untraceable cell.
25	00:02:40	00:02:41	Yo, pig!
26	00:02:41	00:02:43	Don't you touch my hog!
27	00:02:47	00:02:48	Close the door.
28	00:02:52	00:02:53	What do we have, David?
29	00:02:53	00:02:55	Liver stick's 98.
30	00:02:55	00:02:56	No rigor.
31	00:02:56	00:02:57	Lividity isn't fixed.
32	00:02:57	00:02:59	They don't get much fresher.
33	00:03:03	00:03:04	Vegas Blasters.
34	00:03:05	00:03:06	He's flying his colors.
35	00:03:07	00:03:09	That means he's a sworn member of the gang.
36	00:03:09	00:03:11	David, would you turn him over for me, please?
37	00:03:11	00:03:13	Sure thing.
38	00:03:19	00:03:20	Whoa.
39	00:03:20	00:03:22	Multiple knife wounds.
40	00:03:22	00:03:25	Takes a serious blade to cut through leather like that.
41	00:03:27	00:03:30	The knife's sheath on his belt's empty.
42	00:03:30	00:03:32	He was probably trying to defend himself.
43	00:03:33	00:03:34	Do we know who he is?
44	00:03:34	00:03:37	No wallet, no ID, and apparently, there were no eyewitnesses.
45	00:03:38	00:03:40	We have a packed club.
46	00:03:40	00:03:42	Nobody knows what happened?
47	00:03:42	00:03:45	When nobody knows nothing...
48	00:03:45	00:03:47	somebody knows something.
49	00:04:27	00:04:29	This is my first time in a biker bar.
50	00:04:30	00:04:31	Mmm, what's that scent?
51	00:04:31	00:04:35	Beer, urine, sweat, vomit...
52	00:04:36	00:04:37	And death.
53	00:04:37	00:04:43	A lot of people think these guys just run holiday toy drives and host rallies for kids with cancer.
54	00:04:43	00:04:46	In a magic act, that would be called a misdirection.
55	00:04:46	00:04:48	I'd call this a slaughter.
56	00:04:48	00:04:50	All this blood, one victim?
57	00:04:50	00:05:06	I'm thinking it started back there by the second pool table, moved up through this blood pool, where I found the chain, and ended about here, where we found the body.
58	00:05:06	00:05:08	I still can't make any sense of all these bloody footprints.
59	00:05:08	00:05:12	We'll compare them to the shoes of our guys in custody.
60	00:05:12	00:05:14	Meanwhile, I'll start collecting blood samples.
61	00:05:15	00:05:20	The police arrived minutes after the 911 call, so the weapon or weapons may still be here.
62	00:05:20	00:05:21	I'll check the kitchen.
63	00:05:21	00:05:22	Good place to ditch a knife.
64	00:05:24	00:05:29	I want to go take a look at the bikes before they go to impound.
65	00:05:30	00:05:33	Longhorns, nice.
66	00:05:36	00:05:38	Beautiful.
67	00:05:38	00:05:41	Beautiful machines.
68	00:05:41	00:05:42	Okay, thank you.
69	00:05:42	00:05:45	First time I've ever coveted physical evidence.
70	00:05:45	00:05:52	Well, I ran the plates on all of them, and they all came back matched to the people we have in custody, except for this one here. The victim's bike?
71	00:05:52	00:05:53	Possibly.
72	00:05:53	00:05:55	R.O.'s come back a Joseph Niagra.
73	00:05:55	00:05:56	Do we have a home address?
74	00:05:56	00:05:58	You're standing in front of it.
75	00:05:58	00:06:00	But I'll run him through the system.
76	00:06:00	00:06:01	All these guys have records.
77	00:06:01	00:06:03	I tell these kids, You want to join a gang?
78	00:06:03	00:06:04	You should join us.
79	00:06:04	00:06:07	We're more powerful. We got bigger guns...
80	00:06:07	00:06:09	and we got dental.
81	00:06:09	00:06:11	Sold me.
82	00:06:44	00:06:46	Hmm.
83	00:06:46	00:06:47	How's it going here?
84	00:06:47	00:06:51	Well, every single one of these knives tested positive for blood.
85	00:06:51	00:06:54	These are animal, and these are human.
86	00:06:54	00:06:56	You should get these back to the lab.
87	00:06:56	00:06:58	They need you at PD.
88	00:07:03	00:07:05	Oh, Tonya.
89	00:07:05	00:07:08	You should have listened to your mother.
90	00:07:12	00:07:15	When I was in high school, there was this guy, Mark.
91	00:07:15	00:07:17	He had a motorcycle.
92	00:07:17	00:07:18	(camera shutter clicking) Let me guess.
93	00:07:18	00:07:24	Your mom told you to stay away from him, but you were Romeo and Juliet, riding around on 600 pounds of steel.
94	00:07:25	00:07:26	Oh, we had fun.
95	00:07:28	00:07:29	But I moved on.
96	00:07:29	00:07:36	In fact, I didn't give bikers another thought until, years later, I'm in the ER with a hit-and-run victim.
97	00:07:36	00:07:38	Guy on a bike.
98	00:07:38	00:07:41	Just a piece of meat in search of a pulse.
99	00:07:43	00:07:47	The entire time I'm processing him, I never realized it was my Romeo.
100	00:07:47	00:07:49	He was that beat up.
101	00:07:49	00:07:53	24.
102	00:07:53	00:07:56	Multiple abrasions, hematomas.
103	00:07:58	00:07:59	This one's got a looping pattern.
104	00:07:59	00:08:02	Ray said that he found a chain at the scene.
105	00:08:10	00:08:12	It's a good way of slowing somebody down.
106	00:08:12	00:08:15	Maybe he needed slowing down.
107	00:08:18	00:08:19	Take a look at the teeth.
108	00:08:19	00:08:21	This is your mouth on meth.
109	00:08:23	00:08:25	Joseph Niagra.
110	00:08:25	00:08:28	Same as the R.O. on the unclaimed bike.
111	00:08:38	00:08:39	Right hand.
112	00:08:53	00:08:55	Turn around, please.
113	00:08:55	00:08:57	Thank you.
114	00:08:58	00:09:01	Yeah, yeah, I heard you, I heard you.
115	00:09:03	00:09:06	Okay, would you please open your mouth, Mister...
116	00:09:06	00:09:08	Shut up.
117	00:09:08	00:09:09	Get off me!
118	00:09:10	00:09:13	It's my name. Okay.
119	00:09:13	00:09:16	Would you please open your mouth, Mr. Jackass?
120	00:09:19	00:09:21	Next in line?
121	00:09:21	00:09:23	Thank you.
122	00:09:26	00:09:28	Right hand.
123	00:09:41	00:09:44	There's so much grease on these paws.
124	00:09:44	00:09:45	I can't get a clean print.
125	00:09:45	00:09:47	I work in a body shop.
126	00:09:47	00:09:48	What do you expect?
127	00:10:03	00:10:05	Excuse me.
128	00:10:05	00:10:07	All right, you know what? Could you just...?
129	00:10:07	00:10:08	Okay, here.
130	00:10:08	00:10:10	Could you maybe just...
131	00:10:12	00:10:15	Okay, Badger, what happened last night?
132	00:10:17	00:10:20	Did Joey Niagra do something to piss you off?
133	00:10:22	00:10:26	What is this, the biker code of silence?
134	00:10:28	00:10:31	You're the only member of the gang who wasn't carrying a weapon.
135	00:10:32	00:10:33	They're not a gang.
136	00:10:35	00:10:37	They're just a bunch of guys that like to ride together.
137	00:10:37	00:10:41	But you're the only bartender in South Vegas who doesn't carry protection.
138	00:10:41	00:10:44	(chuckles softly) Man...
139	00:10:44	00:10:47	you got to start looking for a better class of bar.
140	00:10:47	00:10:49	You're going to be looking through bars for a long time.
141	00:10:49	00:10:51	Get him out of here.
142	00:11:03	00:11:05	And now your boots.
143	00:11:08	00:11:13	When you're done with fingerprinting, the officer will take you to another room where he'll collect the rest of your clothing.
144	00:11:16	00:11:17	I ain't stripping.
145	00:11:17	00:11:22	I promise you, jail scrubs are much cleaner and more flattering than the blood-and-grease-soaked homicide evidence that you're currently wearing.
146	00:11:22	00:11:24	Let's go, Jackass.
147	00:11:25	00:11:26	Tonya Charles?
148	00:11:26	00:11:28	Would you open your mouth, please?
149	00:11:28	00:11:29	Stick it in your own mouth, bitch.
150	00:11:29	00:11:31	Hey! Hey!
151	00:11:31	00:11:32	You're out of line.
152	00:11:32	00:11:35	Bite my out-of-line ass. You owe Ms. Simms an apology. No, Hodges, it's okay.
153	00:11:35	00:11:38	No, apologize.
154	00:11:39	00:11:40	Uh-oh.
155	00:11:40	00:11:43	Get your hands off me! OFFICER Yeah, girl!
156	00:11:43	00:11:45	That was stupid. (handcuffs click)
157	00:11:45	00:11:47	Ugh, chivalry is not dead.
158	00:11:47	00:11:50	No, but its nose is bleeding.
159	00:11:51	00:11:53	Hold on a second.
160	00:11:54	00:11:55	Property of Joey.
161	00:11:56	00:11:57	Is it Joey Niagra?
162	00:12:18	00:12:20	The victim's bike?
163	00:12:20	00:12:21	Yes.
164	00:12:21	00:12:24	Lots of greasy prints.
165	00:12:25	00:12:27	Look, I found this iPod.
166	00:12:28	00:12:33	It's got an AM-FM receiver and a very interesting playlist.
167	00:12:33	00:12:34	What do you got for me?
168	00:12:34	00:12:37	Joey Niagra popped up in CODIS.
169	00:12:40	00:12:41	dead hooker.
170	00:12:41	00:12:43	I guess he was her last trick.
171	00:12:43	00:12:44	Definitely.
172	00:12:44	00:12:46	Sex was postmortem.
173	00:12:46	00:12:49	Some kind of initiation rite, no doubt.
174	00:12:49	00:12:53	Kill the hooker; have sex with the body; get your colors on your bike.
175	00:12:53	00:12:55	I'm almost done processing here.
176	00:13:01	00:13:02	What is that?
177	00:13:12	00:13:13	Huh.
178	00:13:15	00:13:16	Well...
179	00:13:16	00:13:18	J.N.
180	00:13:18	00:13:20	Joey's missing knife.
181	00:13:20	00:13:21	He didn't put it there.
182	00:13:21	00:13:23	It's been wiped clean.
183	00:13:23	00:13:25	Someone's trying to send us a message.
184	00:13:25	00:13:26	Yeah.
185	00:13:26	00:13:27	Shove it.
186	00:13:30	00:13:31	Jim.
187	00:13:31	00:13:33	Yeah, what's up?
188	00:13:33	00:13:36	Got an alert from Records Bureau you ran prints on Joey Niagra.
189	00:13:36	00:13:37	An alert?
190	00:13:37	00:13:38	Yeah.
191	00:13:38	00:13:41	His real name's Jack Nettles.
192	00:13:41	00:13:45	Vice recruited him two years ago from Indianapolis for an undercover job.
193	00:13:45	00:13:47	So what's going on?
194	00:13:47	00:13:49	The Vegas Blasters homicide.
195	00:13:49	00:13:50	He's the victim.
196	00:13:50	00:13:54	What kind of cop is a tweaking necrophiliac?
197	00:13:58	00:14:02	It's tough giving this kind of news to the wife of a victim. Yeah, well, I'll try to spare her too many details.
198	00:14:02	00:14:04	Well...
199	00:14:14	00:14:15	Rita.
200	00:14:15	00:14:16	What are you...?
201	00:14:19	00:14:25	Mrs. Nettles, I'm Conrad Ecklie, Las Vegas Undersheriff.
202	00:14:25	00:14:27	Oh, uh, please come in.
203	00:14:37	00:14:43	I'm sorry to have to inform you that, uh, your husband...
204	00:14:43	00:14:44	No.
205	00:14:44	00:14:46	Oh, God.
206	00:14:48	00:14:51	Oh, my God!
207	00:14:51	00:14:55	Oh, my God, no!
208	00:14:57	00:15:01	Your husband was killed during an undercover operation.
209	00:15:01	00:15:04	Captain Brass is in charge of the murder investigation.
210	00:15:06	00:15:09	I'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am.
211	00:15:09	00:15:11	My loss?
212	00:15:13	00:15:15	This...
213	00:15:18	00:15:20	This is who I lost...
214	00:15:22	00:15:28	...over six months ago when he turned into someone I didn't recognize anymore.
215	00:15:31	00:15:33	Jim, when did it happen?
216	00:15:33	00:15:34	Last night.
217	00:15:34	00:15:37	It happened last night.
218	00:15:38	00:15:42	I tried to see his captain last night.
219	00:15:42	00:15:43	He's got to help me.
220	00:15:43	00:15:45	He's got to get my husband out of that gang.
221	00:15:45	00:15:47	Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am. I need his help.
222	00:15:48	00:15:50	Captain Collins is not available.
223	00:15:50	00:15:51	Wha...? Take a seat.
224	00:15:51	00:15:54	You've had a few too many.
225	00:15:54	00:15:55	I'll have an officer drive you home. (groans)
226	00:15:55	00:15:57	Okay?
227	00:15:57	00:16:00	I'm sorry. I have to... I...
228	00:16:08	00:16:11	You going to tell me how you know her?
229	00:16:12	00:16:14	No.
230	00:16:33	00:16:36	According to DNA, none of this blood over here is the vic's.
231	00:16:36	00:16:41	This is from the biker named Hooper and this...
232	00:16:41	00:16:44	is from Jackass.
233	00:16:45	00:16:49	This could be from a fight unrelated to the murder.
234	00:16:49	00:16:54	Okay, well, I'm all set up here, so let's try to confirm that those prints are from our victim.
235	00:17:31	00:17:37	It looks like he was trying to get away, but we still don't know who tried to kill him.
236	00:17:37	00:17:40	Or how they found out he was a cop.
237	00:17:40	00:17:41	Back off.
238	00:17:41	00:17:46	See if you like being strip-searched as much as you like shooting off your mouth.
239	00:17:51	00:17:52	Good work, Willows.
240	00:17:52	00:17:53	Ever work undercover?
241	00:17:53	00:17:55	We can always use another tough bitch.
242	00:17:55	00:17:57	Okay.
243	00:17:57	00:18:02	So with you on the inside, when they threw women at Nettles, he could always say that he didn't cheat on his old lady, right?
244	00:18:02	00:18:04	Except for dead hookers. Right?
245	00:18:04	00:18:07	Joey-- Jack-- had to do that.
246	00:18:07	00:18:09	Had to be trusted enough to become a member.
247	00:18:09	00:18:11	Well, obviously something happened to that trust.
248	00:18:11	00:18:16	Jack was trying to learn who the guy at the top is-- the guy calling the shots in the drug racket and the murders for hire.
249	00:18:16	00:18:19	Only a couple in the inner circle know his real identity.
250	00:18:19	00:18:21	They don't use his real name. He goes by Scratch. Scratch...
251	00:18:21	00:18:24	All right, so what happened last night?
252	00:18:24	00:18:26	We-We're in the clubhouse after an all-day ride.
253	00:18:27	00:18:29	C-Couple of fights, nothing unusual.
254	00:18:29	00:18:31	Then the bartender takes a phone call.
255	00:18:31	00:18:32	Like that, atmosphere changes.
256	00:18:32	00:18:33	It's real tense.
257	00:18:40	00:18:42	it's Scratch calling.
258	00:18:42	00:18:48	Then, one of the hangers-- guy who's not a member yet-- he takes all the old ladies and the rest of the hangers and he takes us all outside.
259	00:18:49	00:18:52	Members only. Outside.
260	00:18:54	00:18:55	What time?
261	00:18:55	00:18:58	00, minute or two after.
262	00:18:58	00:19:00	I'm cold. I got to pee.
263	00:19:00	00:19:01	Find a bush.
264	00:19:18	00:19:24	They just killed a guy inside the Blasters' clubhouse-- Rancho Destino, south of Barston.
265	00:19:24	00:19:26	Hurry... hurry.
266	00:19:28	00:19:30	What are you looking at?
267	00:19:32	00:19:34	Anybody see you make that call?
268	00:19:34	00:19:35	I don't think so.
269	00:19:36	00:19:40	According to Vice, Nettles' last report said there's a truckload of cocaine coming in from Mexico.
270	00:19:40	00:19:43	Yeah, only the West Side bike gang Righteous Dogs got wind of it.
271	00:19:43	00:19:44	It's going to be a war.
272	00:19:44	00:19:49	Do you know where and when this shipment is gonna take place? Yeah-- no-- I-I'll find out.
273	00:19:49	00:19:51	No, you won't, 'cause Ecklie took you off the detail.
274	00:19:51	00:19:53	What?!
275	00:19:53	00:19:54	No!
276	00:19:54	00:19:55	No.
277	00:19:55	00:19:56	No way in hell, man!
278	00:19:56	00:19:58	Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.
279	00:19:58	00:19:59	Hey!
280	00:19:59	00:20:00	What are you on?
281	00:20:00	00:20:02	What do you think?
282	00:20:02	00:20:04	You picked me up partying with bikers.
283	00:20:04	00:20:05	Calm down. Calm down.
284	00:20:05	00:20:07	What do you want me to do?
285	00:20:07	00:20:13	I want you to get Ecklie in here so I can tell him I ain't quitting.
286	00:20:13	00:20:15	I'm not letting Jack die in vain.
287	00:20:17	00:20:20	C.O.D. was exsanguination.
288	00:20:20	00:20:28	Found significant amount of internal hemorrhage to the lung and pleural cavity from stabs to the liver and mesentery.
289	00:20:28	00:20:31	So he was alive and his heart was beating the entire time?
290	00:20:31	00:20:33	Until it was lacerated.
291	00:20:33	00:20:35	It's one of the final injuries, along with this one.
292	00:20:37	00:20:42	Stab wound to the left temple about, oh... two inches deep.
293	00:20:45	00:20:48	Quite a lot of stab marks.
294	00:20:48	00:20:51	We need to compare these with the weapons we've collected.
295	00:20:51	00:20:53	I'll cut them all out and send them upstairs.
296	00:20:53	00:20:54	23 stab wounds.
297	00:20:54	00:20:55	Twenty-four.
298	00:20:55	00:20:57	I was thinking of Julius Caesar.
299	00:20:57	00:21:01	Ah... history's first recorded autopsy.
300	00:21:01	00:21:04	Doctor named Antistius did the honors, if I recall.
301	00:21:04	00:21:09	On the body of a man betrayed by those he knew well.
302	00:22:31	00:22:35	The blood on the knife that you found in the motorcycle seat was the victim's.
303	00:22:35	00:22:40	And I was able to match that knife to the stab to the sternum and the left temple.
304	00:22:40	00:22:41	What about the other knives?
305	00:22:41	00:22:48	Double-edged, serrated, smooth blade-- none of which was a match to the tool marks on the body.
306	00:22:48	00:22:51	And none of the blood on those knives came back to the victim.
307	00:22:51	00:22:54	But I did get two CODIS hits from the knives that Hodges collected.
308	00:22:54	00:23:01	These guys were both members of the Righteous Dogs, and their body parts were found scattered across two miles of the Mojave.
309	00:23:01	00:23:03	Probably carved them up in the kitchen.
310	00:23:04	00:23:05	The Blasters and the Dogs are rival gangs.
311	00:23:06	00:23:09	There's been a war over drug turf escalating over the last year.
312	00:23:10	00:23:14	We still only have one of the knives used to kill Nettles.
313	00:23:14	00:23:15	There had to be others.
314	00:23:15	00:23:20	All right, the police arrived one minute, just one minute, after the 911 call.
315	00:23:20	00:23:23	Those other knives couldn't have gone very far.
316	00:23:23	00:23:27	No. I appreciate that, Conrad, I do, but there's no need for me to recuse myself, really.
317	00:23:27	00:23:29	No.
318	00:23:29	00:23:31	If the situation changes, yeah, I'll, uh, I'll let you know.
319	00:23:31	00:23:33	Okay?
320	00:23:34	00:23:36	I got to go. Thank you.
321	00:23:41	00:23:44	Rita. Hi.
322	00:23:44	00:23:46	Hi.
323	00:23:46	00:23:47	Can I come in?
324	00:23:47	00:23:49	Oh, sure, sure. I hope this is okay.
325	00:23:49	00:23:50	No. It's fine.
326	00:23:50	00:23:53	Uh, they asked me to come down about some paperwork. Sure.
327	00:23:53	00:23:54	Come on in. I hope this is okay.
328	00:23:54	00:23:56	Come in. Please, come in.
329	00:23:56	00:23:57	Sit down.
330	00:23:57	00:23:59	Sit down. Please, sit down.
331	00:24:00	00:24:02	(sniffles) Can I get you anything?
332	00:24:02	00:24:03	Do you want anything at all?
333	00:24:03	00:24:06	Oh. A shoulder?
334	00:24:06	00:24:07	Oh, Rita. No. I know. I know.
335	00:24:07	00:24:09	This isn't the place for that. I'm sorry. I just...
336	00:24:09	00:24:11	That's not it. That's not it. That's not it.
337	00:24:11	00:24:15	Why didn't you ever tell me that you were a cop?
338	00:24:15	00:24:17	What? I didn't? I-I thought...
339	00:24:19	00:24:20	No, I guess not. I...
340	00:24:20	00:24:23	I told you that I was married.
341	00:24:24	00:24:25	Uh, kind of.
342	00:24:25	00:24:27	Let's not, um...
343	00:24:27	00:24:29	We don't really have to talk about that now.
344	00:24:29	00:24:30	That's not important, all right?
345	00:24:30	00:24:31	Look... We've been over that.
346	00:24:31	00:24:34	No, I want... I want to ex...
347	00:24:34	00:24:35	explain to you. I...
348	00:24:35	00:24:37	You don't have to explain anything to me.
349	00:24:37	00:24:44	I was calling his captain every day because weeks are going by, and I'm not hearing from Jack.
350	00:24:44	00:24:47	I woke up once in the middle of the night.
351	00:24:47	00:24:51	He had snuck in, and he was stealing some money out of my purse.
352	00:24:53	00:24:55	He was on drugs or something.
353	00:24:55	00:24:57	I don't know.
354	00:24:57	00:25:00	He started hitting me.
355	00:25:00	00:25:07	And I was... I was pulling on his shirt, trying to get him to stop it, and I...
356	00:25:09	00:25:11	I see the name Tonya... Yeah.
357	00:25:11	00:25:13	...tattooed on his chest, and...
358	00:25:13	00:25:19	How could he ever be my husband again after he'd had another woman's name burned into his skin like that? I...
359	00:25:20	00:25:21	Rita...
360	00:25:21	00:25:23	I didn't tell you the truth...
361	00:25:25	00:25:27	...because I was afraid.
362	00:25:27	00:25:29	I'm sorry.
363	00:25:29	00:25:31	Because I, uh... I handled it badly.
364	00:25:32	00:25:33	I was not very graceful about... (knocking)
365	00:25:35	00:25:37	Jim? I'm sorry. Excuse me.
366	00:25:37	00:25:38	Yeah. No. What? What's up?
367	00:25:39	00:25:41	Said you wanted to know when Tonya Charles is released.
368	00:25:41	00:25:42	Right.
369	00:25:58	00:26:00	Rita?
370	00:26:00	00:26:02	Yeah?
371	00:26:02	00:26:07	We are doing everything we can to find the killer of your husband.
372	00:26:30	00:26:32	You lost?
373	00:26:33	00:26:34	I don't think so. (chuckles)
374	00:26:35	00:26:36	Where's your car?
375	00:26:36	00:26:38	I'm working a theory.
376	00:26:38	00:26:40	Now, there are multiple murder weapons.
377	00:26:40	00:26:41	We only have one.
378	00:26:41	00:26:43	I checked the perimeter again. They're not here.
379	00:26:43	00:26:49	All right, first responding said that a couple of bikers got away just as they showed up.
380	00:26:50	00:26:52	Okay. Yeah, maybe they took the knives with them.
381	00:26:52	00:26:54	All right, I'm one of them. I know the police are rolling.
382	00:26:54	00:26:58	I don't want to get picked up carrying the weapon, so I'm going to ditch them as quickly as possible, right?
383	00:26:58	00:27:03	Right. But you know, you can use your department vehicle to look for that stuff.
384	00:27:03	00:27:05	You want to catch a rat, you move like a rat.
385	00:27:05	00:27:07	Okay. Yeah.
386	00:27:07	00:27:09	Yeah, responding units came in from the east and the west.
387	00:27:09	00:27:11	All right, south of here is residential.
388	00:27:11	00:27:13	Too many eyes, too many ears.
389	00:27:13	00:27:15	I'll start looking north.
390	00:27:16	00:27:18	Good luck.
391	00:30:14	00:30:17	All the knives I found match tool marks on the victim's body.
392	00:30:17	00:30:22	And the prints we lifted match five of the bikers we have in custody, but none of them are talking.
393	00:30:22	00:30:26	Well, if we don't find evidence on the rest of the bikers, the D.A.'s going to start releasing them.
394	00:30:26	00:30:27	I'm on it. Thanks.
395	00:30:31	00:30:32	You paged me?
396	00:30:32	00:30:36	Yeah. I got the call records from that phone at the bar.
397	00:30:36	00:30:39	02 p.m.
398	00:30:39	00:30:43	Okay, well, that's consistent with the undercover officer's statement.
399	00:30:43	00:30:44	Where did it originate?
400	00:30:45	00:30:47	Looks like it was from a pay phone.
401	00:30:51	00:30:54	The call to the bar came from our police department?
402	00:31:01	00:31:03	Was Nettles dimed out by another cop?
403	00:31:03	00:31:06	They're checking surveillance footage from the time of that call.
404	00:31:06	00:31:10	Jim, I've heard you got a potential conflict of interest in this case.
405	00:31:11	00:31:13	No, I don't.
406	00:31:15	00:31:16	Okay, what do you got?
407	00:31:16	00:31:17	Have a clean shot of the caller.
408	00:31:17	00:31:19	All right, let's run it.
409	00:31:25	00:31:27	That's Rita.
410	00:31:29	00:31:32	I'd say you got a conflict now.
411	00:31:34	00:31:35	I don't know why I'm here.
412	00:31:35	00:31:36	I didn't kill Jack.
413	00:31:37	00:31:39	Tell me about your call to the Blasters' clubhouse.
414	00:31:39	00:31:41	How did you get that number?
415	00:31:41	00:31:43	Jack gave it to me.
416	00:31:43	00:31:50	In case of emergencies, I'm supposed to call and ask for Joey Niagra, and say that I'm his mother.
417	00:31:50	00:31:51	So, that's what you're doing in the photo? Yes.
418	00:31:51	00:31:53	Why did you use the phone here?
419	00:31:53	00:31:54	So that we'd think a cop made the call?
420	00:31:54	00:31:56	No. What did you say?
421	00:31:56	00:31:58	I-I asked for Jack.
422	00:31:58	00:32:01	I... For Joey. I-I... I just...
423	00:32:01	00:32:02	I just wanted to hear his voice.
424	00:32:02	00:32:04	No. No.
425	00:32:04	00:32:05	You told them he was a cop. Isn't that right?
426	00:32:05	00:32:10	No! You admitted you'd already lost him, but if you got a divorce, you'd end up with, what?
427	00:32:10	00:32:12	A pile of debt, and a house worth less than the mortgage.
428	00:32:12	00:32:13	Right? What are you doing?
429	00:32:13	00:32:16	With one phone call, you got his death benefit and his pension.
430	00:32:16	00:32:18	That's not true!
431	00:32:29	00:32:33	Tonya managed to get word back to Vice.
432	00:32:33	00:32:34	A cocaine shipment's in from Mexico.
433	00:32:34	00:32:35	Where? She doesn't know.
434	00:32:35	00:32:37	Wherever Scratch told them to drop it off.
435	00:32:37	00:32:39	So, we got to find out who Scratch is.
436	00:32:39	00:32:40	He'll lead us to the drugs.
437	00:32:40	00:32:42	In the meantime, Righteous Dogs are cruising the streets.
438	00:32:42	00:32:44	We need to find that coke before they do.
439	00:33:06	00:33:08	Looks like they released some more of the old ladies.
440	00:33:08	00:33:10	Yep.
441	00:33:12	00:33:16	There goes the victim's girlfriend.
442	00:33:34	00:33:37	This is Charlie-05-Stokes.
443	00:33:37	00:33:38	I'm on Rancho Destino south of Barston.
444	00:33:39	00:33:42	One of our U.C. vehicles just exploded with a U.C. officer inside the vehicle.
445	00:33:42	00:33:44	Send Fire and paramedics.
446	00:33:44	00:33:47	U.C. officer was inside the vehicle.
447	00:34:04	00:34:08	Looks like the incendiary device detonated fast and big.
448	00:34:08	00:34:11	Red paper, wax-coated.
449	00:34:11	00:34:13	This is dynamite.
450	00:34:13	00:34:15	They must've known Tonya was undercover.
451	00:34:16	00:34:21	And from the moment the cops responded to the 911 call, we had this lot and the street under control.
452	00:34:21	00:34:23	This bomb's too sophisticated.
453	00:34:23	00:34:25	Must've been planted before Nettles was killed.
454	00:34:26	00:34:30	Whether or not they knew Nettles was a cop, they were on to Tonya.
455	00:34:30	00:34:34	And the order had to have come from the head guy, Scratch.
456	00:34:34	00:34:36	Makes sense. That's the guy she was after.
457	00:34:36	00:34:39	I'll head back with the body.
458	00:34:42	00:34:47	According to the blood evidence, the fight started here at the bar and moved forward.
459	00:34:47	00:34:52	Probably the first injury came from the tire chain to Nettles' left knee.
460	00:34:52	00:34:54	I'm Nettles.
461	00:34:54	00:34:59	I see what's going down and I make a run to go out the back.
462	00:34:59	00:35:01	I'm Smitty.
463	00:35:01	00:35:06	My prints were on the chain that was collected here.
464	00:35:07	00:35:10	I hit his left knee.
465	00:35:10	00:35:12	Nettles was facing in this direction.
466	00:35:23	00:35:25	So, now, you're down.
467	00:35:26	00:35:28	your knife.
468	00:35:28	00:35:33	I think he was reaching for it when Jackass got in on the fight.
469	00:35:33	00:35:35	Hodges, you're Jackass.
470	00:35:35	00:35:36	And don't I know it.
471	00:35:37	00:35:40	All right, your knife matches cuts on Nettles' right arm.
472	00:35:40	00:35:43	Okay, so, I'm over him.
473	00:35:48	00:36:01	All right, that cast-off over there could have been from the repeated stabbing of an area that bleeds heavily, such as the two clavicle wounds that match Hooper's knife.
474	00:36:01	00:36:08	All right, in order for Hooper to reach the clavicle, I'll have to get down on my right knee...
475	00:36:13	00:36:17	And at this point, his right arm is pretty much useless.
476	00:36:17	00:36:21	So, he pulls himself with his left hand.
477	00:36:21	00:36:24	But they didn't stop.
478	00:36:24	00:36:25	Judge Death here...
479	00:36:25	00:36:28	stabbed him in the kidneys.
480	00:36:36	00:36:39	And then he somehow managed to try to get to the front door.
481	00:36:39	00:36:42	And they let him because they knew he wasn't going to get very far.
482	00:36:47	00:36:50	And then they use Nettles' own knife on him.
483	00:36:50	00:36:55	But I think it was the stab to his temple that finally stopped him.
484	00:37:04	00:37:09	And that's how we found him, and that proves a bar fight, but not a setup.
485	00:37:09	00:37:11	You're right.
486	00:37:11	00:37:18	02 p.m., and the fight started right after that.
487	00:37:18	00:37:25	It's unlikely that they would kill a member of their own gang or a cop without direct orders from Scratch.
488	00:37:25	00:37:30	So, either Scratch was here, or whoever took the call contacted Scratch.
489	00:37:30	00:37:35	00 on any of the bikers' cell phones or the bar phone.
490	00:37:35	00:37:36	Wait a second.
491	00:37:50	00:37:52	There's a bug in here.
492	00:37:52	00:37:55	There was nothing in Nettles' case notes that mentioned one.
493	00:37:55	00:37:58	Nettles' iPod had a radio receiver.
494	00:37:58	00:38:01	If he was able to install a transmitter...
495	00:38:01	00:38:03	Let me talk to Joey!
496	00:38:03	00:38:04	He's with his old lady.
497	00:38:04	00:38:06	Tonya, is that her name?
498	00:38:06	00:38:08	Huh? How young is she? Hmm?
499	00:38:08	00:38:10	She's real young?
500	00:38:10	00:38:13	He's a cop! You know that?
501	00:38:13	00:38:14	A cop!
502	00:38:14	00:38:16	His name is not Joey!
503	00:38:16	00:38:18	Hey, who is this?
504	00:38:18	00:38:19	I'm his wife!
505	00:38:19	00:38:21	Okay, all right, all right.
506	00:38:21	00:38:22	Jim...
507	00:38:22	00:38:27	Vice sent over another surveillance wiretap where a man identified as Scratch was recorded.
508	00:38:27	00:38:30	I was able to grab enough to make a comparison.
509	00:38:35	00:38:38	Hey, who is this?
510	00:38:38	00:38:39	Yo, what is this?
511	00:38:42	00:38:44	Hey, who is this? Yo, what is this?
512	00:38:44	00:38:47	So, Scratch is the bartender.
513	00:38:51	00:38:53	Nice chopper.
514	00:38:53	00:38:57	If this paint is scratched, you got a problem.
515	00:39:36	00:39:39	They all just left.
516	00:39:58	00:40:00	I've got them.
517	00:40:00	00:40:02	They're moving east on Sunset Road.
518	00:40:03	00:40:07	Just turned south onto Hasbrook.
519	00:40:07	00:40:09	They're stopping behind an industrial building.
520	00:40:09	00:40:11	Number 2106.
521	00:40:27	00:40:28	It's Kenny.
522	00:40:45	00:40:48	Sorry, Scratch.
523	00:40:51	00:40:53	Dogs found it first.
524	00:40:59	00:41:01	Las Vegas Police!
525	00:41:04	00:41:06	Put your hands above your head!
526	00:41:06	00:41:08	Las Vegas Police!
527	00:41:08	00:41:11	Put your hands up!
528	00:41:17	00:41:20	Put your hands where I can see 'em!
529	00:41:29	00:41:30	Stop!
530	00:41:40	00:41:41	Not moving! I'm not moving!
531	00:41:41	00:41:43	Hey, don't hate me, man.
532	00:41:45	00:41:47	That bitch cop was easy to make.
533	00:41:47	00:41:50	And your boy Joey should've took care of his wife.
534	00:41:50	00:41:52	Shut up.
535	00:42:25	00:42:29	I know this is your favorite way of wrapping up a tough case.
536	00:42:29	00:42:33	Little scotch... little talk.
537	00:42:35	00:42:38	You feel like talking?
538	00:42:47	00:42:49	All right, then.
