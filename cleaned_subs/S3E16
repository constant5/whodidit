0	00:00:35	00:00:38	We have a high-speed chase in progress.
1	00:00:45	00:00:47	( thudding, tires squealing ) He is going in a tunnel.
2	00:00:56	00:00:57	What's your stand of a pursuit?
3	00:01:01	00:01:02	The suspect become intoxicated.
4	00:01:07	00:01:10	We will maintain. Over.
5	00:01:15	00:01:18	Driver, cut the engine and throw the keys out the window.
6	00:01:19	00:01:22	Driver, cut the engine and throw the keys out the window!
7	00:01:48	00:01:50	Excuse us. Excuse me, sir.
8	00:01:51	00:01:52	Thank you.
9	00:01:54	00:01:56	Death-- the cheapest show in Vegas.
10	00:01:56	00:01:58	Yeah, it doesn't surprise me.
11	00:01:58	00:02:00	You remember the MGM fire?
12	00:02:00	00:02:04	We found people burned to their slot machines 'cause they wouldn't leave the action.
13	00:02:04	00:02:05	Only in Vegas.
14	00:02:14	00:02:16	This guy's got a piece of wood sticking out of his head.
15	00:02:16	00:02:17	Alex James, age 42.
16	00:02:17	00:02:20	Found his wallet in the glove compartment.
17	00:02:20	00:02:22	SUV is registered to him.
18	00:02:22	00:02:24	No previous record.
19	00:02:24	00:02:26	How was he able to drive?
20	00:02:26	00:02:30	I once saw a guy walk 15 blocks with three bullets in his face.
21	00:02:30	00:02:31	The victim was traveling west on Flamingo.
22	00:02:31	00:02:33	The Desert Palm isn't too far from here.
23	00:02:33	00:02:35	I guess he was en route to the hospital.
24	00:02:35	00:02:39	I don't much care where he was going.
25	00:02:39	00:02:40	I want to know where he's been.
26	00:03:28	00:03:30	I like coming in the back way, huh?
27	00:03:30	00:03:31	Yeah, makes us VIPs tonight.
28	00:03:31	00:03:33	Let me help you, ma'am. Sir?
29	00:03:33	00:03:34	No, thanks.
30	00:03:34	00:03:36	Oh, it's not luggage. Thank you, though.
31	00:03:36	00:03:37	You must be CSI.
32	00:03:37	00:03:39	I'm Warrick Brown. This is Catherine Willows.
33	00:03:39	00:03:42	You said you had a situation in your casino?
34	00:03:42	00:03:43	A kidnap.
35	00:03:43	00:03:44	Is it a high profile?
36	00:03:44	00:03:48	Yes. We'd like to deal with this locally before we involve the FBI.
37	00:03:48	00:03:52	Well, until we know the victim was taken over state lines, the FBI has no jurisdiction.
38	00:03:53	00:03:55	Do you have any contact from the kidnappers?
39	00:03:55	00:03:58	A ransom note was left at the front desk.
40	00:03:58	00:04:00	Who are we looking for here?
41	00:04:00	00:04:02	A five-year-old boy.
42	00:04:02	00:04:04	Whose five-year-old boy?
43	00:04:04	00:04:05	Tavian Tombs.
44	00:04:05	00:04:08	Tavian Tombs, professional basketball player.
45	00:04:08	00:04:09	Very high profile.
46	00:04:15	00:04:19	I got eight people to make sure that something like this does not happen.
47	00:04:19	00:04:21	Where the hell was everybody?
48	00:04:21	00:04:22	Out spending my money?
49	00:04:22	00:04:29	You're supposed to be the head of security, and you let my son get kidnapped right from under my nose.
50	00:04:29	00:04:31	You better have a good reason for being here.
51	00:04:31	00:04:33	We're here to find your son.
52	00:04:33	00:04:39	We're with the Crime Lab, and I'm assuming that that's our ransom note.
53	00:04:39	00:04:42	It's my note, my kid, my show.
54	00:04:42	00:04:45	Look, I've seen you take out three guys on the glass and still finish.
55	00:04:45	00:04:47	I'm not here to bang boards with you.
56	00:04:47	00:04:48	I'm here to do my job.
57	00:04:48	00:04:50	It's your son, it's your call.
58	00:04:52	00:04:55	I'm going to dunk on you again.
59	00:04:55	00:04:56	Yeah.
60	00:05:03	00:05:04	I have Isaiah.
61	00:05:04	00:05:10	Bring $5 million to the northwest corner of Telfair 00 a.m.
62	00:05:10	00:05:12	How many of you touched this letter?
63	00:05:12	00:05:14	I did. We all did.
64	00:05:14	00:05:16	I just want my boy back.
65	00:05:16	00:05:18	Did this note come in an envelope?
66	00:05:18	00:05:21	Yeah... I threw it in the wastebasket.
67	00:05:27	00:05:30	We have a better chance of getting uncompromised prints off of this.
68	00:05:30	00:05:33	You said that Captain Brass was here?
69	00:05:34	00:05:36	Yeah. He's interviewing the nanny.
70	00:05:36	00:05:39	We were at the carnival, me and the boys.
71	00:05:42	00:05:45	They wanted to ride on the carousel. I said no.
72	00:05:47	00:05:49	But you gave in.
73	00:05:50	00:05:51	Special weekend.
74	00:05:51	00:05:52	Dad's in town.
75	00:05:52	00:05:53	Everybody's together.
76	00:05:53	00:05:56	Trust me, they don't understand no.
77	00:06:08	00:06:10	Jason!
78	00:06:10	00:06:11	Jason, where's Isaiah?
79	00:06:11	00:06:13	Jason!
80	00:06:14	00:06:14	Where's your brother?!
81	00:06:14	00:06:16	Jason, where's your brother?!
82	00:06:16	00:06:18	He was right there.
83	00:06:20	00:06:22	And then he...
84	00:06:22	00:06:28	I swear to you, I looked everywhere, but I knew he was gone.
85	00:06:28	00:06:31	So...
86	00:06:31	00:06:34	I brought the kids back here and had to tell Tavian.
87	00:06:34	00:06:36	And his wife.
88	00:06:36	00:06:37	They're not married.
89	00:06:37	00:06:39	And even if they were, it'd still be Tavian's show.
90	00:06:39	00:06:42	A woman who knows her employer.
91	00:06:42	00:06:43	I should.
92	00:06:43	00:06:46	He's my brother.
93	00:06:46	00:06:48	It took you that long to pull the paper together?
94	00:06:49	00:06:50	Soft Count Room wouldn't go any faster.
95	00:06:50	00:06:53	The casino's fronting the ransom money?
96	00:06:53	00:06:57	Mr. Tombs has a multimillion-dollar line of credit with us.
97	00:06:57	00:07:00	We strongly advise that you don't hand over that money.
98	00:07:00	00:07:02	At least let us mark it.
99	00:07:02	00:07:05	You know how long it'd take to mark $5 million large?
100	00:07:05	00:07:06	The kidnapper knows.
101	00:07:06	00:07:08	Longer than the drop-off time.
102	00:07:08	00:07:10	Now, the letter said corner of Telfair and Juniper.
103	00:07:10	00:07:13	That's where this bag is going.
104	00:07:22	00:07:25	Sharp force trauma.
105	00:07:25	00:07:28	Shouldn't we get the spike out of his head before we try to get any prints off it?
106	00:07:28	00:07:31	I'm afraid if we try to remove it, we'll eradicate the prints.
107	00:07:36	00:07:38	I'm not going to get any prints off of this.
108	00:07:38	00:07:39	Well, he sure is dirty.
109	00:07:39	00:07:41	I mean, he isn't homeless.
110	00:07:41	00:07:42	This is his car, right?
111	00:07:42	00:07:44	Yeah.
112	00:07:44	00:07:46	I'm going to scrape his nails.
113	00:07:59	00:08:01	Hand me a bindle.
114	00:08:08	00:08:13	Hey, fellas, you're never going to guess what I found under the seat.
115	00:08:13	00:08:16	A .38 Special.
116	00:08:27	00:08:29	Catherine wanted to know if you have anything.
117	00:08:29	00:08:32	She can't convince Tavian to change his mind about the ransom money.
118	00:08:32	00:08:34	8 1/2 x 11 plain white copy paper.
119	00:08:34	00:08:35	It's mass-produced.
120	00:08:36	00:08:37	You can get it anywhere.
121	00:08:37	00:08:40	The envelope, unfortunately, is self-adhering.
122	00:08:40	00:08:42	No DNA. No.
123	00:08:42	00:08:43	What about the text?
124	00:08:43	00:08:45	It's just standard laser, nondescript.
125	00:08:46	00:08:47	So you got nothing.
126	00:08:47	00:08:48	Nothing I can see.
127	00:10:04	00:10:07	Looks like something out of Nosferatu.
128	00:10:07	00:10:11	Yeah, only the wooden stake is in his head, not his heart.
129	00:10:11	00:10:16	I've never seen that before-- a wooden stake embedded in the high parietal scalp in the midline.
130	00:10:16	00:10:20	Hold his head down firmly, will you?
131	00:10:20	00:10:22	On three.
132	00:10:22	00:10:23	One...
133	00:10:24	00:10:25	two... three!
134	00:10:34	00:10:41	Irregular puncture defect to the scalp, laceration to the sagittal sinus.
135	00:10:41	00:10:44	The wound track stops at the falx cerebri.
136	00:10:44	00:10:46	No gross penetration of the cerebrum.
137	00:10:46	00:10:49	That stake is what kept him driving.
138	00:10:49	00:10:50	Tamponading?
139	00:10:50	00:10:57	Well, the application of more than normal pressure to the wound acts like a plug, temporarily keeping him alive.
140	00:10:57	00:11:06	The spike probably struck between the brain hemispheres most likely lodging into the parietal bones and holding it in place.
141	00:11:06	00:11:11	They say it's a game of inches-- a centimeter to the left or right, and he would have bled out and died instantly.
142	00:11:11	00:11:14	Yeah, but head trauma this severe, surgery would've probably killed him anyway.
143	00:11:14	00:11:18	That, or live an extra hour in excruciating pain.
144	00:11:19	00:11:21	They weren't lying.
145	00:11:21	00:11:22	They all touched it.
146	00:11:22	00:11:25	Everybody's who's got a piece of Tavian got a hand on that ransom note.
147	00:11:25	00:11:28	Even the bellman and the desk clerk left prints on the envelope.
148	00:11:28	00:11:30	Any unidentified prints?
149	00:11:30	00:11:32	Just a few smudges, a couple of partials.
150	00:11:32	00:11:33	So prints don't help.
151	00:11:33	00:11:34	No.
152	00:11:35	00:11:36	Liquid extraction results.
153	00:11:36	00:11:40	Yeah, that was detected on the ransom note-- menthol and nicotine.
154	00:11:42	00:11:44	Nicotine.
155	00:11:44	00:11:47	So we're looking for a smoker-- menthol smoker.
156	00:12:08	00:12:09	Everybody hold.
157	00:12:10	00:12:13	We don't make a move until after he's taken the money.
158	00:12:28	00:12:30	Stand down.
159	00:12:34	00:12:37	We're way past the drop time here.
160	00:12:37	00:12:40	Yeah. Well, let's give it a couple more.
161	00:12:44	00:12:47	So, what's your take on this?
162	00:12:47	00:12:48	Inside or outside job?
163	00:12:48	00:12:54	No, I think it's just some freak with a nicotine habit and access to a laser printer.
164	00:12:54	00:12:55	Did you see the action he got?
165	00:12:55	00:12:59	One phone call, $5 million gets delivered to his hotel?
166	00:12:59	00:13:02	Yeah, that money's not doing him any good now, huh?
167	00:13:02	00:13:04	Yeah.
168	00:13:10	00:13:11	It's just gone bad. Oh, man.
169	00:13:12	00:13:15	Hey! Hey!
170	00:13:15	00:13:17	What are you doing? Put the guns down!
171	00:13:17	00:13:19	Put the guns down!
172	00:13:20	00:13:21	What the hell are you doing?
173	00:13:21	00:13:24	Tavian wanted me to be sure the transfer got done.
174	00:13:24	00:13:27	This is our job-- not yours, not Tavian's.
175	00:13:27	00:13:30	What are you concerned about here-- the kid or your job?
176	00:13:30	00:13:31	I didn't do nothing.
177	00:13:31	00:13:32	Nobody took the money-- didn't even show.
178	00:13:32	00:13:33	I been here all night just like you.
179	00:13:33	00:13:35	They spotted you.
180	00:13:35	00:13:36	You understand?
181	00:13:36	00:13:38	The kidnappers saw you.
182	00:13:38	00:13:40	They made us. ( cell phone rings )
183	00:13:40	00:13:43	I was doing what Tavian asked me to, man.
184	00:13:43	00:13:45	Brass.
185	00:13:58	00:14:00	It's him.
186	00:14:02	00:14:06	I'll take the perimeter.
187	00:14:06	00:14:07	Body's in an unnatural position.
188	00:14:08	00:14:09	Maybe this is only the dump site.
189	00:14:09	00:14:14	His body's also coated.
190	00:14:14	00:14:19	Makes me think whoever did this didn't even stop the car.
191	00:14:22	00:14:24	Something had to have gone wrong.
192	00:14:25	00:14:27	Something did.
193	00:14:29	00:14:32	Do not let them cut him.
194	00:14:32	00:14:34	I don't want them even touching him.
195	00:14:43	00:14:45	We're taking the body.
196	00:14:45	00:14:49	Mr. Tombs I'm sorry, but in a crime like this, an autopsy's mandatory.
197	00:14:49	00:14:53	Evidence from your son's body may lead us to the suspect.
198	00:14:53	00:14:55	You're telling me what I can and can't do?
199	00:14:56	00:14:58	It's not your call anymore.
200	00:15:06	00:15:08	How you doing over there?
201	00:15:08	00:15:09	I got scat.
202	00:15:09	00:15:10	Feces? Yep.
203	00:15:10	00:15:11	Under the fingernail?
204	00:15:11	00:15:12	Yep.
205	00:15:12	00:15:16	He wiped his own ass?
206	00:15:16	00:15:18	No, Nick, it's not human.
207	00:15:18	00:15:19	It's scat.
208	00:15:21	00:15:23	Could be from a bat.
209	00:15:23	00:15:24	Bat scat.
210	00:15:24	00:15:25	Bat guano.
211	00:15:25	00:15:26	Well, whatever.
212	00:15:26	00:15:28	It's a lot better than what I got.
213	00:15:28	00:15:32	As far as I can tell, the wood's Douglas Fir with a side of God knows what.
214	00:15:32	00:15:37	I'm no geologist, but these splinters are intertwined with some kind of mineral.
215	00:15:37	00:15:38	Is it sparkly?
216	00:15:38	00:15:39	Oh, yeah.
217	00:15:40	00:15:41	Let me see.
218	00:15:47	00:15:49	I think it's quartz. Or fluorite.
219	00:15:49	00:15:51	Great.
220	00:15:51	00:15:54	That limits it to every outdoor area in Greater Nevada.
221	00:15:54	00:15:59	Mountain ranges, mine shafts, quarries... underground sewers.
222	00:16:00	00:16:02	All home to bats.
223	00:16:06	00:16:09	Hey.
224	00:16:11	00:16:13	Why don't you let me handle this?
225	00:16:13	00:16:15	Thanks.
226	00:16:15	00:16:19	I'm not ready to deal with another murdered kid.
227	00:16:19	00:16:22	I'll process the evidence.
228	00:16:26	00:16:28	No apparent cause of death.
229	00:16:28	00:16:30	I'll send a blood sample to Tox.
230	00:16:33	00:16:35	The foam around his mouth?
231	00:16:35	00:16:37	Could indicate pulmonary edema.
232	00:16:37	00:16:43	Found bruising in the lower extremities and the knees, but these injuries are a few days old.
233	00:16:43	00:16:45	The bruises are at various stages of healing.
234	00:16:45	00:16:49	Well, that could be from roughhousing with his older brothers.
235	00:16:49	00:16:50	What about this bruise?
236	00:16:51	00:16:52	Well...
237	00:16:52	00:16:54	let's see, it extends around the body...
238	00:16:54	00:16:57	like so.
239	00:16:57	00:16:59	Ah, I've seen this before.
240	00:16:59	00:17:02	Did you find rope at the scene?
241	00:17:03	00:17:05	We haven't found the scene.
242	00:17:36	00:17:38	Outer City Salvage Company.
243	00:17:38	00:17:40	Owned and operated by Alex James.
244	00:17:43	00:17:45	Las Vegas Police. I have a warrant.
245	00:17:45	00:17:46	I'll clear the back.
246	00:17:46	00:17:48	Thanks.
247	00:17:53	00:17:56	When's the last time you saw a dinosaur like this?
248	00:17:56	00:17:58	Lemons on the reels.
249	00:17:58	00:18:01	Not since Sam Braun ran the town.
250	00:18:01	00:18:02	Old Vegas.
251	00:18:08	00:18:09	Buckshot pellets.
252	00:18:09	00:18:11	Looks like he loaded his own.
253	00:18:21	00:18:23	A melting furnace.
254	00:18:23	00:18:24	What's that for?
255	00:18:24	00:18:27	Melting precious metals.
256	00:18:30	00:18:32	Quenched it in the tub?
257	00:18:35	00:18:37	Hey, fellas, take a look at this.
258	00:18:41	00:18:43	More precious metals.
259	00:18:43	00:18:45	And the pawn tickets.
260	00:18:46	00:18:49	Easily traceable.
261	00:18:54	00:18:57	Topographical maps of the Sierra Nevada.
262	00:19:00	00:19:07	Delamar Quadrangle, Lincoln County, La Madre Mountain... Clark County.
263	00:19:12	00:19:14	Hey, Nick.
264	00:19:17	00:19:20	Blood spatter and a bullet hole, maybe?
265	00:19:24	00:19:25	Through-and-through.
266	00:19:28	00:19:31	Oh, yeah.
267	00:19:33	00:19:35	Medium caliber.
268	00:19:37	00:19:39	This is our primary crime scene?
269	00:19:39	00:19:42	Except that our vic had a stake in his head. He wasn't shot.
270	00:19:42	00:19:44	Yeah, but he had a .38 in his car.
271	00:19:44	00:19:47	We're looking for another body.
272	00:19:55	00:19:56	It was a tip.
273	00:19:56	00:19:57	A $10,000 gold chip?
274	00:19:58	00:19:59	I don't think so.
275	00:19:59	00:20:03	If it was a tip, you wouldn't have had to lose the bellman's outfit to cash it in.
276	00:20:03	00:20:03	Now where'd you get this?
277	00:20:03	00:20:05	I found it, sort of.
278	00:20:05	00:20:06	You found it sort of.
279	00:20:07	00:20:08	Tavian is always surrounded by women.
280	00:20:08	00:20:10	Guys, too, but they want autographs.
281	00:20:10	00:20:12	The chicks-- they want something else.
282	00:20:16	00:20:20	Now, usually his boys turn them away, but this one got through.
283	00:20:20	00:20:22	Get the hell out of my way.
284	00:20:22	00:20:23	I want to see Tavian.
285	00:20:25	00:20:30	There were definitely chicks a lot hotter, but I guess when you can have anything...
286	00:20:30	00:20:31	They leave together? No, just the opposite.
287	00:20:31	00:20:33	They got into it right there.
288	00:20:33	00:20:34	You're a lousy father to Tramelle.
289	00:20:34	00:20:37	And you think the whole world worships you.
290	00:20:37	00:20:38	But the truth is, you're just a deadbeat.
291	00:20:38	00:20:39	Whatever.
292	00:20:39	00:20:42	This what you want?
293	00:20:42	00:20:46	Casino taxes me $24 an hour regardless of what I make.
294	00:20:46	00:20:48	And do you know how much a zillionaire like Tavian Tombs tips?
295	00:20:49	00:20:50	Zip. Nothing.
296	00:20:50	00:20:53	Not even change I can throw in the fountain.
297	00:20:53	00:20:55	And why? Because he's comped all the way around.
298	00:20:55	00:20:58	R.F.B.-- room, food, beverage-- including tips.
299	00:20:58	00:21:02	So, when ten large goes sliding across the floor, and nobody sees it?
300	00:21:02	00:21:04	Get out of the way, 'cause Kevin's coming through.
301	00:21:08	00:21:10	Yeah, I get the picture.
302	00:21:10	00:21:11	Hey, I tried to give it back.
303	00:21:11	00:21:13	This is yours.
304	00:21:13	00:21:17	Keep it.
305	00:21:17	00:21:19	Yeah, yeah, sure you did.
306	00:21:19	00:21:21	So, uh, what about my money?
307	00:21:21	00:21:23	Don't be stupid.
308	00:21:23	00:21:24	Who's the blonde he's talking about?
309	00:21:24	00:21:25	I don't know.
310	00:21:26	00:21:28	Look, big casinos honor each other's chips.
311	00:21:28	00:21:29	So, how you tracking these?
312	00:21:29	00:21:31	Bar code, embedded transmitters, what?
313	00:21:31	00:21:32	Look, it's okay.
314	00:21:32	00:21:37	It's easy for the guys at the lab to figure this out, but we'll let the other casinos know you helped us out.
315	00:21:37	00:21:39	Her name is Bridget Willis.
316	00:21:39	00:21:41	She's on his list.
317	00:21:41	00:21:43	Thank you.
318	00:21:46	00:21:51	Hey, Griss, ballistics matched the .38 bullet to the gun in the victim's car.
319	00:21:51	00:21:53	As for the splinters on the stake...
320	00:21:53	00:21:54	you were right.
321	00:21:54	00:21:57	Quartz. Fluorite.
322	00:21:57	00:22:00	Dolomite, barite, calcite, antimony.
323	00:22:00	00:22:02	Well, the Mass Spec dug deeper.
324	00:22:02	00:22:04	Arsenic and cyanide.
325	00:22:04	00:22:08	Now, as of late, that's what's used to extract gold.
326	00:22:09	00:22:12	Do you have any idea how many mine shafts there are in the state of Nevada?
327	00:22:12	00:22:13	Yeah, hundreds.
328	00:22:13	00:22:17	Including gold and silver mines in Nelson, Searchlight, Goodsprings.
329	00:22:17	00:22:18	You name it.
330	00:22:18	00:22:21	I've got Lockwood running a background check on our vic.
331	00:22:21	00:22:24	Maybe we'll get lucky.
332	00:22:31	00:22:32	Bridget Willis?
333	00:22:32	00:22:33	Mm-hmm.
334	00:22:33	00:22:35	I'm Detective Jim Brass, Vegas PD.
335	00:22:35	00:22:38	This is Catherine Willows from the Crime Lab.
336	00:22:38	00:22:41	You're here to talk to my son Tramelle?
337	00:22:45	00:22:48	We already have.
338	00:22:48	00:22:51	I was in college.
339	00:22:51	00:22:54	He was the man, Mr. Final Four.
340	00:22:54	00:22:57	I thought I'd won the lottery.
341	00:22:57	00:23:01	Then I got pregnant, and he went in the lottery, so...
342	00:23:03	00:23:06	Take a look around. Guess what we fight about.
343	00:23:07	00:23:09	Money. He's rich, I'm not.
344	00:23:09	00:23:11	I've accepted that.
345	00:23:11	00:23:13	But he does have responsibilities.
346	00:23:14	00:23:14	Tramelle.
347	00:23:15	00:23:18	A weekend here and there doesn't make a father.
348	00:23:19	00:23:21	Tramelle's not one of his boys.
349	00:23:21	00:23:24	He's his son.
350	00:23:24	00:23:28	Kid comes home with a armful of presents and a broken heart every time.
351	00:23:28	00:23:29	Ms. Willis...
352	00:23:29	00:23:31	is Tramelle your only child?
353	00:23:31	00:23:32	No.
354	00:23:32	00:23:34	I have a little girl.
355	00:23:35	00:23:37	Why wasn't she with Tavian's other kids at the carnival?
356	00:23:37	00:23:39	She wasn't invited.
357	00:23:39	00:23:40	I'm not taking her.
358	00:23:40	00:23:41	I'm not taking your girl.
359	00:23:41	00:23:43	Tramelle's been talking about this weekend for months.
360	00:23:43	00:23:44	She just wants to come.
361	00:23:44	00:23:48	Then what you better do is explain to her that I'm Tramelle's father, not hers.
362	00:23:48	00:23:50	What difference does one little girl make?
363	00:23:50	00:23:53	It's all about what's mine.
364	00:23:53	00:23:55	Mommy.
365	00:23:55	00:23:56	What's for lunch?
366	00:23:56	00:23:58	Just a minute, okay, sweetie?
367	00:24:00	00:24:05	So, instead, I took her to Sweet Creatures at the Forum Shops.
368	00:24:08	00:24:10	Don't fill it too much, sweetie.
369	00:24:12	00:24:13	Oh, yes, I've been there.
370	00:24:14	00:24:17	Works wonders on the disappointments of little girls.
371	00:24:17	00:24:20	That's what I was hoping for.
372	00:24:23	00:24:24	For you.
373	00:24:24	00:24:25	Thanks.
374	00:24:25	00:24:26	Have you taken a look?
375	00:24:26	00:24:28	I'm just trying to learn.
376	00:24:28	00:24:29	Well?
377	00:24:29	00:24:32	Well, the fiber you tweezed from that sweatshirt-- Trace pegged it as sisal.
378	00:24:33	00:24:34	Sisal?
379	00:24:34	00:24:35	Rope?
380	00:24:35	00:24:37	Mostly likely from the restraint.
381	00:24:37	00:24:40	What's under the scope?
382	00:24:40	00:24:41	Take a look.
383	00:24:44	00:24:45	Oh, hair.
384	00:24:45	00:24:48	But cuticle's a single layer.
385	00:24:48	00:24:50	Overlapping.
386	00:24:50	00:24:52	It's not human.
387	00:24:52	00:24:53	It's canine.
388	00:24:53	00:24:55	Sweatshirt was riddled with dog hair.
389	00:24:55	00:24:57	Many different breeds.
390	00:24:57	00:24:59	You think the kidnapper used it as a lure?
391	00:24:59	00:25:01	Kids love dogs.
392	00:25:01	00:25:04	I know when I was a kid, I was all over them.
393	00:25:04	00:25:06	That's a good start.
394	00:25:07	00:25:08	Thanks.
395	00:25:08	00:25:12	Found them in Isaiah's stomach contents.
396	00:25:12	00:25:14	Pill casings.
397	00:25:14	00:25:17	Starts to break down as soon as it hits the mouth.
398	00:25:17	00:25:18	The shell is porous.
399	00:25:18	00:25:22	In the stomach, the medicine leeches out, enters the bloodstream.
400	00:25:22	00:25:23	The case is left behind.
401	00:25:23	00:25:28	Eventually, the casing's broken down, as well, but by then, the medicine's already working.
402	00:25:28	00:25:29	I see a USP number.
403	00:25:29	00:25:32	Well, it should be listed in the PDR, but I couldn't find it.
404	00:25:32	00:25:33	What have you got?
405	00:25:33	00:25:35	Pill casings.
406	00:25:35	00:25:37	He was drugged?
407	00:25:37	00:25:38	Looks that way.
408	00:25:38	00:25:41	Well, we lifted dog hair from the sweatshirt we found near the body.
409	00:25:41	00:25:43	So, our kidnapper had contact with dogs.
410	00:25:43	00:25:45	Multiple breeds.
411	00:25:45	00:25:47	Dog lover? Dog walker?
412	00:25:47	00:25:49	Hey, how about a vet?
413	00:25:49	00:25:55	Try the reference of Veterinary Pharmaceuticals and Biologicals.
414	00:26:04	00:26:07	Acepromazine Maleate.
415	00:26:07	00:26:09	Tranquilizer.
416	00:26:09	00:26:10	25 milligrams.
417	00:26:10	00:26:14	Four pills wouldn't have been fatal for a child Isaiah's size.
418	00:26:14	00:26:17	Based on the blood levels, these remnants were probably a second dose.
419	00:26:18	00:26:20	It wasn't the money drop that went bad.
420	00:26:21	00:26:22	The problem was Isaiah died.
421	00:26:22	00:26:24	I'll call Brass.
422	00:26:24	00:26:30	I'll have him check vet clinics, kennels, pet supply stores, and we'll extend the radius out from the dump site.
423	00:26:30	00:26:31	Okay.
424	00:26:31	00:26:34	Our man Alex James is quite the land owner.
425	00:26:34	00:26:40	According to the Mining Laws of 1872, public land can still be patented for five dollars an acre-- a law which is still in effect.
426	00:26:40	00:26:44	That's all this guy did was buy and sell publicly-owned, government land.
427	00:26:44	00:26:48	Funny thing is, there was one mine that he sold over and over again.
428	00:26:48	00:26:50	Now, why would he do that?
429	00:26:50	00:26:51	Now, there lies the mystery.
430	00:26:51	00:26:53	So, who was the last person he sold to?
431	00:26:54	00:26:55	Joe McPherson. Local.
432	00:26:55	00:26:56	Where is he now?
433	00:26:56	00:26:57	No one knows.
434	00:26:58	00:26:59	He's been missing for 48 hours.
435	00:27:00	00:27:01	There lies the mystery.
436	00:27:01	00:27:04	Where's the mine?
437	00:27:09	00:27:11	What's with the gate?
438	00:27:11	00:27:12	It's a bat gate.
439	00:27:12	00:27:15	It keeps people out, lets the bats in.
440	00:27:15	00:27:19	Old mines are considered bat habitats and preserves.
441	00:27:19	00:27:20	Who puts the bat gates in?
442	00:27:20	00:27:23	Batman.
443	00:27:31	00:27:33	What have you got?
444	00:27:34	00:27:36	Insect chitin.
445	00:27:36	00:27:39	It's usually found near the entrance of caves.
446	00:27:49	00:27:51	Guano.
447	00:27:51	00:27:53	We got bats.
448	00:27:53	00:27:54	Oh.
449	00:27:54	00:27:56	Good.
450	00:27:59	00:28:01	Probably California Leaf-nosed Bats.
451	00:28:02	00:28:04	They don't bite, do they?
452	00:28:04	00:28:05	They're like bees, Nick.
453	00:28:05	00:28:08	You don't bother them, they won't bother you.
454	00:28:08	00:28:11	Well, hey, let's... let's not bother them, okay?
455	00:28:11	00:28:12	I'm serious.
456	00:28:27	00:28:29	Are you seeing this?
457	00:28:29	00:28:31	Gold.
458	00:28:31	00:28:33	We're rich.
459	00:28:33	00:28:36	I'm not so sure.
460	00:28:47	00:28:49	Another buckshot casing.
461	00:28:49	00:28:54	And these look like impact patterns.
462	00:28:54	00:28:55	So, he was loading his own.
463	00:28:56	00:28:57	But not with pellets.
464	00:28:57	00:28:58	With gold.
465	00:28:58	00:29:00	Pawn shop jewelry and melting furnace.
466	00:29:00	00:29:04	You know, Lockwood said that James sold this parcel of land multiple times.
467	00:29:04	00:29:07	I think he was running a scam.
468	00:29:37	00:29:40	He was salting the mind.
469	00:29:48	00:29:50	Insect party.
470	00:29:50	00:29:51	Yeah.
471	00:29:51	00:29:54	Cockroaches, cave crickets.
472	00:29:54	00:29:55	Carabid beetles.
473	00:29:55	00:29:58	All heading deeper into the cave.
474	00:29:58	00:30:00	Why?
475	00:30:00	00:30:03	Maybe they got tired of eating bat guano.
476	00:30:04	00:30:07	So, this is three blocks from the place where Isaiah's body was found.
477	00:30:07	00:30:08	Why don't you guys take the kennel?
478	00:30:08	00:30:11	Metcalf and I are going to take the dog run.
479	00:31:03	00:31:04	Cath?
480	00:31:19	00:31:22	We found something. I think you wanna take a look at this.
481	00:31:25	00:31:29	Jacob Price. Local. He works night shift here.
482	00:31:30	00:31:32	Looks like somebody beat us to him.
483	00:31:36	00:31:38	Partner you think?
484	00:31:38	00:31:40	Or a guy who knows how to finish.
485	00:31:45	00:31:46	I don't want to hear this.
486	00:31:46	00:31:54	Yeah, well... I've been on the job a long time, and I know what a tragedy like this can do to a family.
487	00:31:54	00:31:56	I told you, I don't want to hear it.
488	00:31:56	00:32:03	What's going to happen is one day Kenisha or Tramelle or one of your other kids is going to come to you and say, What happened to Isaiah?
489	00:32:03	00:32:06	And they're going to want to know the truth.
490	00:32:06	00:32:09	Nothing you say is going to change anything.
491	00:32:09	00:32:12	The guy who took Isaiah worked in a kennel.
492	00:32:12	00:32:14	He was used to handling dogs, not children.
493	00:32:14	00:32:20	When Isaiah tried to escape, he was restrained, and when that didn't work, he was drugged.
494	00:32:27	00:32:31	Now, drugs have a different effect on adults than on children.
495	00:32:31	00:32:33	It's called the paradoxical effect.
496	00:32:33	00:32:39	So, when the tranquilizers weren't working, this guy-- Price-- upped the dosage.
497	00:32:48	00:32:52	Now, as a father, I can understand why you'd want this guy dead.
498	00:32:52	00:32:54	What?
499	00:32:54	00:32:56	Whoa.
500	00:32:57	00:32:59	You think I killed him?
501	00:33:05	00:33:07	Yes, I do.
502	00:33:10	00:33:12	I didn't kill anybody.
503	00:33:14	00:33:16	I don't even know who he is.
504	00:33:16	00:33:22	But if I'd gotten to him before you, I swear I would not have stopped to think about it.
505	00:33:59	00:34:01	Don't fill it too much, sweetie.
506	00:34:02	00:34:03	You said the bigger the better.
507	00:34:08	00:34:10	Air's getting thick.
508	00:34:10	00:34:13	Smells like trinitrotoluene.
509	00:34:21	00:34:23	Look familiar?
510	00:34:23	00:34:27	Yeah. But how did it get in the back of the guy's head?
511	00:34:31	00:34:34	Fuse line.
512	00:34:34	00:34:36	Dynamite.
513	00:34:59	00:35:01	Chest wound.
514	00:35:01	00:35:05	Possibly from our .38. Looks about 2days old.
515	00:35:09	00:35:10	Joe McPherson.
516	00:35:10	00:35:12	Local.
517	00:35:12	00:35:14	Mr. MIA.
518	00:35:18	00:35:25	You know, wooden support beams, fuse line, TNT...
519	00:35:25	00:35:30	I think, uh, Alex James was trying to hide this body in the back of his mine.
520	00:35:30	00:35:31	You scammed me.
521	00:35:31	00:35:31	No.
522	00:35:31	00:35:33	That was my life savings.
523	00:35:33	00:35:34	Take it easy.
524	00:35:35	00:35:36	Listen, now-now, now, lookit.
525	00:35:36	00:35:38	I-I, I can explain everything, all right?
526	00:35:38	00:35:39	Listen, Joe.
527	00:35:39	00:35:41	Joe, come on, I-I sold you the wrong mine.
528	00:35:41	00:35:43	I-It's an honest mistake.
529	00:35:43	00:35:44	You're a liar!
530	00:36:02	00:36:05	Like most fuses, it probably burnt too quickly and he couldn't outrun the blast.
531	00:36:08	00:36:10	Or the wooden stake.
532	00:36:41	00:36:43	Okay.
533	00:36:43	00:36:45	Sample from the kennel is on your right.
534	00:36:45	00:36:46	Your bear is on the left.
535	00:36:54	00:36:56	Visible match.
536	00:37:09	00:37:10	Bridget Willis?
537	00:37:10	00:37:13	Las Vegas police.
538	00:37:20	00:37:22	Tramelle, where's your mother?
539	00:37:23	00:37:23	I don't know.
540	00:37:23	00:37:25	She left with my sister.
541	00:37:25	00:37:28	She said my daddy would come get me.
542	00:37:29	00:37:31	She's not here.
543	00:37:31	00:37:33	I'll put out an APB.
544	00:37:41	00:37:45	So, Tavian was paying Bridget child support-- three grand a month.
545	00:37:45	00:37:47	Three grand a month?
546	00:37:47	00:37:56	Tavian Tombs has been a $12 million-a-year player for eight seasons, not including endorsements.
547	00:37:56	00:37:59	Well, he made his deal with Bridget when Tramelle was born.
548	00:37:59	00:38:01	Bad timing for her.
549	00:38:01	00:38:02	Motive for us.
550	00:38:02	00:38:05	She was right to assume that Tavian would immediately pay that ransom.
551	00:38:05	00:38:08	What's five million to a guy who makes hundreds of millions?
552	00:38:08	00:38:09	And it is his son.
553	00:38:09	00:38:11	I'm sure he would have paid any amount.
554	00:38:11	00:38:18	So, how does that dog kennel guy Price figure into all this, and was killing him part of the plan?
555	00:38:18	00:38:19	I don't know.
556	00:38:19	00:38:23	I think that Bridget Willis killed him because he killed Isaiah.
557	00:38:30	00:38:34	In her act of redemption, she gives Tramelle to Tavian.
558	00:39:26	00:39:29	Come here.
559	00:39:36	00:39:38	Hello, Tramelle.
560	00:39:38	00:39:39	Hi.
561	00:39:46	00:39:48	Okay.
562	00:39:48	00:39:52	According to Greg, the blood on the bullet's a direct match to Joe McPherson.
563	00:39:52	00:39:53	It's a done deal.
564	00:39:53	00:39:56	You know, I was talking to a lady in the County Records Office.
565	00:39:56	00:39:59	She said those land patents have been changing hands for over 50 years.
566	00:39:59	00:40:01	That figures.
567	00:40:01	00:40:02	There's a sucker born every minute.
568	00:40:02	00:40:06	Yup, and they all come to Vegas.
