1,00:00:15,00:00:21,"Like any good hunter, the photographer stalks, takes aim, and shoots an image."
2,00:00:21,00:00:29,Who's to say that when the shutter traps that moment in time those primitive fears weren't well founded?

13,00:02:29,00:02:31,Megan has no reason to run away.
14,00:02:31,00:02:34,She's always been a happy kid and we trust her implicitly.
15,00:02:34,00:02:39,"Captain, this is not like her. Of course it's no accident they're missing together. MAN: Ryan has a scholarship to Duke."
16,00:02:39,00:02:41,He's not going to throw it away for some chippie.
17,00:02:41,00:02:46,"Excuse me? ""Chippie""? Your daughter's the one who's calling our house 25 times a day."
18,00:02:46,00:02:47,"BRASS: All right, all right, all right."
19,00:02:47,00:02:50,This isn't helping.
20,00:02:50,00:02:52,The kids have been missing since last night.
21,00:02:52,00:02:54,Why you'd wait till now to report it?
22,00:02:54,00:02:57,We thought that Megan was sleeping over at Sheila's.
23,00:02:57,00:02:58,Sheila who?
24,00:02:58,00:03:00,"Uh, Sheila Latham, her best friend."
25,00:03:00,00:03:06,"When I called Megan on her cell phone this morning, I couldn't reach her, so I called the house, and, uh, she wasn't there."
26,00:03:06,00:03:08,And Sue Latham didn't know anything about a sleep-over.
27,00:03:08,00:03:10,MAN: Ryan doesn't have a curfew.
28,00:03:10,00:03:13,But he never stays out all night.
29,00:03:13,00:03:16,"He's not answering his cell phone, and his van is missing."
30,00:03:16,00:03:20,"MAN 2: Captain, please, find my daughter before she does something stupid."
31,00:03:20,00:03:22,Stupid I can live with.
32,00:03:22,00:03:25,I need to know they're okay.
33,00:03:27,00:03:32,BRASS: The last place they were seen was the parking lot at the school after the game.
34,00:03:32,00:03:35,GRISSOM: These two kids have only been missing for 14 hours.
35,00:03:35,00:03:37,They could have eloped to Mexico.
36,00:03:37,00:03:38,"I know, but..."
37,00:03:38,00:03:40,All right.
38,00:03:40,00:03:43,But you owe me one for getting me out of bed on a Saturday morning.
39,00:03:44,00:03:45,Mitch?
40,00:03:45,00:03:49,This is Ryan Lansco's assigned parking spot.
41,00:03:49,00:03:52,His drives a blue '72 Ford van.
42,00:03:52,00:03:53,It's missing.
43,00:03:54,00:03:55,What do you want me to test?
44,00:03:57,00:03:59,MITCH: Doesn't look like transmission fluid.
45,00:04:07,00:04:09,Did you have assigned parking when you were in high school?
46,00:04:09,00:04:11,No. We didn't even have cars.
47,00:04:17,00:04:19,"Yeah, it's blood."
48,00:04:21,00:04:23,I hope they're in Mexico.
49,00:04:56,00:05:04,"STOKES: 40 may be the new 20, but... 16's the new 30, between cars and cell phones and the Internet."
50,00:05:04,00:05:07,"Yeah, well, the world's become a very small place, Nick."
51,00:05:07,00:05:11,All the vices are closer to home.
52,00:05:17,00:05:19,Hey.
53,00:05:40,00:05:43,GRISSOM: More polyfil.
54,00:05:48,00:05:51,"Hey, Nick?"
55,00:05:51,00:05:53,Yeah?
56,00:05:53,00:05:55,This looks like arterial spraying.
57,00:05:57,00:05:58,Something bad happened here.
58,00:06:01,00:06:06,"STOKES: A little blood in the parking lot, a lot of blood here."
59,00:06:06,00:06:08,But very little in between?
60,00:06:13,00:06:14,Hey.
61,00:06:14,00:06:17,Look at that equipment shed door.
62,00:06:27,00:06:29,Some kind of broken glass.
63,00:06:34,00:06:35,"Well, this was kicked in."
64,00:07:08,00:07:10,Sheila.
65,00:07:12,00:07:14,Megan told her parents she was spending the night with you.
66,00:07:14,00:07:17,But first she was... gonna hook up.
67,00:07:17,00:07:19,With Ryan after the game.
68,00:07:19,00:07:20,Do you know where?
69,00:07:20,00:07:21,No.
70,00:07:22,00:07:22,Sheila...
71,00:07:22,00:07:24,What? I don't know.
72,00:07:24,00:07:29,Excuse me? Your best friend is missing and you're at a police station. Act accordingly.
73,00:07:29,00:07:32,And sit up straight.
74,00:07:34,00:07:35,Are you okay?
75,00:07:35,00:07:38,"Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I just have a headache."
76,00:07:38,00:07:39,Were you drinking last night?
77,00:07:39,00:07:42,"Mom, no!"
78,00:07:42,00:07:43,Look...
79,00:07:43,00:07:46,a couple of us went out for burgers and then I came home.
80,00:07:46,00:07:48,Megan was supposed to call me on my cell...
81,00:07:48,00:07:51,and I was going to go downstairs and let her in.
82,00:07:51,00:07:52,And did she call?
83,00:07:52,00:07:53,No.
84,00:07:53,00:07:54,And you weren't worried?
85,00:07:54,00:07:57,I thought it was just an overtime make-out session.
86,00:07:57,00:07:59,I fell asleep.
87,00:07:59,00:08:01,And now I'm here.
88,00:08:01,00:08:03,WILLOWS: Both kids have an ATM card.
89,00:08:03,00:08:05,Neither's been used since they went missing.
90,00:08:05,00:08:07,No calls were placed from either of their cell phones.
91,00:08:07,00:08:10,There's an APB out on Ryan's van-- no hits.
92,00:08:10,00:08:12,An APB has gone out to local hospitals-- nothing yet.
93,00:08:12,00:08:14,I know. It sucks.
94,00:08:14,00:08:16,Any calls placed before they went missing?
95,00:08:16,00:08:18,(laughs): Where do I start?
96,00:08:18,00:08:22,Megan and Sheila phoned each other about a dozen times.
97,00:08:22,00:08:24,A handful of calls were placed to Charlie and Bonnie.
98,00:08:24,00:08:26,They're both on the cheerleading squad.
99,00:08:26,00:08:30,"""Hair up or down? Black socks or gold socks?"" How about Ryan?"
100,00:08:30,00:08:33,"Ryan, uh, and Megan exchanged a few calls."
101,00:08:33,00:08:34,He phoned home twice.
102,00:08:34,00:08:37,His last call was after the game to a Diane Kentner.
103,00:08:37,00:08:39,She is the photography teacher at the high school.
104,00:08:39,00:08:41,Warrick is following up and...
105,00:08:41,00:08:44,I'm going to collect DNA exemplars from the kids' houses.
106,00:08:44,00:08:47,My favorite part.
107,00:08:54,00:08:57,SANDERS: Wish I had one of these back in high school.
108,00:08:57,00:08:59,What's that? A letter jacket?
109,00:08:59,00:09:01,"No. No, a love shack."
110,00:09:01,00:09:05,"Back seat of my car got real old, real fast."
111,00:09:05,00:09:09,"I was getting so much play my senior year, I seriously considered getting a hearse."
112,00:09:09,00:09:12,"Well, I never accused you of not being smart."
113,00:09:12,00:09:14,"Greg, you're a little weird, but..."
114,00:09:14,00:09:16,a hearse?
115,00:09:16,00:09:18,"So what's with the ropes, Casanova?"
116,00:09:18,00:09:20,"Well, I don't think they were working out."
117,00:09:20,00:09:23,Looks like what started out as a good time went bad.
118,00:09:45,00:09:46,I'd know those footsteps anywhere.
119,00:09:48,00:09:51,The glass you found on the track is optical glass.
120,00:09:51,00:09:53,"Camera lens, not spectacle."
121,00:09:53,00:09:58,Camera lenses have one side that's round and one side that's flat for a high refractive index.
122,00:09:58,00:10:00,It bends the light more.
123,00:10:04,00:10:07,It also has magnesium fluoride and calcium fluoride coatings for anti-reflection.
124,00:10:07,00:10:16,"You're looking for a high-end, non-compact camera-- Nikon, Leica, or Canon-- that's missing its lens."
125,00:10:17,00:10:20,"Thank you, David."
126,00:10:24,00:10:26,Warrick Brown from the crime lab.
127,00:10:26,00:10:28,Thanks for coming in on a Saturday.
128,00:10:28,00:10:31,Diane Kentner.
129,00:10:31,00:10:34,I took these photographs of Megan and Ryan.
130,00:10:34,00:10:36,"I like those. Yeah, I teach photography."
131,00:10:36,00:10:40,"Well, that's a nice shot right there. Thanks."
132,00:10:40,00:10:42,That's Charlie Kellerman.
133,00:10:42,00:10:45,I try to take pictures of what the kids are passionate about.
134,00:10:45,00:10:48,So I guess he's passionate about photography.
135,00:10:48,00:10:51,Yeah. That and Megan.
136,00:10:51,00:10:55,Charlie's in love with her. She's in love with Ryan.
137,00:10:55,00:10:58,Ryan's in love with his future.
138,00:10:58,00:11:00,"Ah, high school. Yeah."
139,00:11:00,00:11:04,Did you notice any drama yesterday in class between Megan and Ryan?
140,00:11:04,00:11:05,No.
141,00:11:05,00:11:09,"I mean, if a day goes by that a teenage girl doesn't cry in my class, it's a rarity."
142,00:11:09,00:11:12,"But yesterday, it wasn't Megan."
143,00:11:12,00:11:14,And Ryan's head was already in the game.
144,00:11:14,00:11:16,He's got a lot of pressure on him.
145,00:11:16,00:11:18,He's oldest of six.
146,00:11:18,00:11:22,His parents are already counting the money that he's gonna make from his first NBA contract.
147,00:11:22,00:11:24,Hmm.
148,00:11:24,00:11:27,"Ms. Kentner, what kind of cameras do you use in class?"
149,00:11:27,00:11:29,We have a couple of junky ones.
150,00:11:29,00:11:31,Students usually bring their own.
151,00:11:31,00:11:33,And what about your own personal collection?
152,00:11:33,00:11:35,"Well, I'm old school."
153,00:11:35,00:11:37,"I mean, I took these with a Hasselblaad, but..."
154,00:11:37,00:11:39,"otherwise, I use a Minolta I've had forever."
155,00:11:39,00:11:40,Why?
156,00:11:40,00:11:43,Just following up on some evidence.
157,00:11:43,00:11:45,And Ryan called you after the game last night.
158,00:11:45,00:11:49,"Yeah, he wanted copies of the photos the photography club had taken."
159,00:11:49,00:11:50,And he called you on your cell?
160,00:11:50,00:11:52,"Yeah, I put it on the syllabus."
161,00:11:52,00:11:54,You can have it if you want.
162,00:11:54,00:11:57,"No, thanks. I've... I've already got it."
163,00:11:57,00:12:00,I'm not seeing any evidence of other people.
164,00:12:00,00:12:06,"It's possible that the basketball player snapped, killed the cheerleader, took her body and drove off."
165,00:12:07,00:12:08,What about the busted door?
166,00:12:08,00:12:11,He starts out the big romantic...
167,00:12:12,00:12:15,"Oh, don't break your million-dollar foot. Shh."
168,00:12:16,00:12:19,SANDERS: And that's when things went south.
169,00:12:19,00:12:20,Ryan.
170,00:12:20,00:12:22,Stop. I told you Come on. I want to wait till prom.
171,00:12:22,00:12:24,It's gonna be fun. Stop it!
172,00:12:24,00:12:26,"She pushes him off, makes a run for it."
173,00:12:26,00:12:34,"But he realizes that an attempted rape charge might crash a Duke scholarship, so he chases her down and bashes her head in."
174,00:12:34,00:12:36,(phone rings)
175,00:12:36,00:12:38,Stokes.
176,00:12:38,00:12:39,"Oh, hey, Wendy."
177,00:12:39,00:12:41,Really?
178,00:12:41,00:12:42,"Yeah, thanks."
179,00:12:42,00:12:46,How does your theory account for the fact that all the blood's Ryan's?
180,00:12:46,00:12:49,It doesn't.
181,00:12:49,00:12:51,Okay.
182,00:12:51,00:12:53,Let's say I'm a Lovers Lane rapist.
183,00:12:53,00:12:55,I stalk them.
184,00:12:55,00:12:57,I want me a high school cheerleader.
185,00:12:57,00:12:58,What's the first thing I do?
186,00:12:58,00:13:00,You take out the basketball player.
187,00:13:00,00:13:03,"Grab her, take her somewhere more private."
188,00:13:03,00:13:05,Why take Ryan's body?
189,00:13:07,00:13:09,People...
190,00:13:09,00:13:11,let's spiral out.
191,00:13:58,00:14:01,(camera shutter clicking)
192,00:14:02,00:14:03,Greg.
193,00:14:03,00:14:06,Accident debris.
194,00:14:07,00:14:08,Broken turn signal light.
195,00:14:08,00:14:13,Lots of pieces of grille for a physical match.
196,00:14:13,00:14:18,Shoes match the description of the sneakers Megan Cooper was wearing last night.
197,00:14:19,00:14:22,"So far, the only blood I found was on the shoes."
198,00:14:28,00:14:30,This road has almost no traffic at night.
199,00:14:31,00:14:32,Take a look at this.
200,00:14:33,00:14:36,GRISSOM: Looks like acceleration marks.
201,00:14:36,00:14:39,"Start out heavy, and then they fade out as the vehicle gains momentum."
202,00:14:42,00:14:45,They're in a direct line with the accident debris.
203,00:14:45,00:14:47,That tells me it's probably related to the impact.
204,00:14:47,00:14:54,"If Megan was hit by a car, hard enough to knock her out of her own shoes, I doubt she just walked away from this."
205,00:14:54,00:14:59,So far there's no reports of anyone fitting Megan's description being admitted to area hospitals.
206,00:14:59,00:15:03,I had a friend once that got hit by this big-ass van.
207,00:15:03,00:15:05,Knocked him like 200 feet in the air.
208,00:15:28,00:15:30,Nick!
209,00:15:30,00:15:31,Yeah?
210,00:15:31,00:15:34,Straight ahead of you about 20 yards.
211,00:15:36,00:15:38,Yeah!
212,00:15:38,00:15:40,"Yeah, I got her."
213,00:15:43,00:15:44,Is she still alive?
214,00:15:44,00:15:47,Barely.
215,00:15:49,00:15:53,Yeah...
216,00:15:53,00:15:56,Okay... All right.
217,00:15:56,00:15:57,"Right, yeah, yeah, hold on."
218,00:15:58,00:15:59,We found Megan.
219,00:15:59,00:16:01,She's alive.
220,00:16:01,00:16:04,She was found on the side of the road near the high school.
221,00:16:04,00:16:06,She's apparently victim of a hit-and-run car accident.
222,00:16:06,00:16:10,She's in a very serious condition and has been taken to Desert Palm Hospital.
223,00:16:10,00:16:12,And what about Ryan?
224,00:16:12,00:16:14,We haven't found him yet.
225,00:16:14,00:16:15,We're still looking.
226,00:16:15,00:16:17,Go ahead.
227,00:16:17,00:16:18,Let's go.
228,00:16:26,00:16:29,Uniforms found the van on patrol.
229,00:16:30,00:16:31,They called it in.
230,00:16:31,00:16:33,"I cleared it, waited for you guys to open it up."
231,00:16:41,00:16:45,Front end's intact.
232,00:16:45,00:16:48,"No damage, no paint transfer."
233,00:16:48,00:16:49,There's no signs of an accident.
234,00:16:49,00:16:51,The keys are still in the ignition.
235,00:16:51,00:16:53,There's no blood on the driver's seat.
236,00:16:53,00:17:00,"CURTIS: Which means Ryan probably wasn't driving, because his blood was all over the field."
237,00:17:05,00:17:07,(camera shutter clicks)
238,00:17:18,00:17:20,Body dump?
239,00:17:31,00:17:32,Where's the body?
240,00:17:32,00:17:34,(camera shutter clicks)
241,00:17:36,00:17:38,Hospital food.
242,00:17:38,00:17:40,Oh. The best I could do.
243,00:17:40,00:17:42,Any word?
244,00:17:42,00:17:44,Not yet.
245,00:17:44,00:17:46,You know Megan.
246,00:17:46,00:17:47,She's a fighter. She'll pull through this.
247,00:17:47,00:17:49,"Thank you, Charlie. Thank you."
248,00:17:49,00:17:51,You've always been very good to her.
249,00:17:51,00:17:52,Excuse me.
250,00:17:52,00:17:54,I'm Nick Stokes with the Crime Lab.
251,00:17:54,00:17:56,"Oh, Charlie, he's the one that found Megan."
252,00:17:56,00:17:57,Thank you.
253,00:17:57,00:17:59,You're very welcome.
254,00:17:59,00:18:00,I left your mom a message.
255,00:18:01,00:18:02,I wanted to ask you a few questions.
256,00:18:02,00:18:03,You mind if I...
257,00:18:03,00:18:04,steal him for a minute?
258,00:18:04,00:18:06,Sure.
259,00:18:06,00:18:09,"I understand you and Megan were pretty close, huh?"
260,00:18:09,00:18:12,We live next door to each other.
261,00:18:12,00:18:15,"I drive her to school every day, home after cheerleading practice."
262,00:18:15,00:18:17,You wait that whole time?
263,00:18:17,00:18:20,"Don't cheerleaders work out for, like, hours?"
264,00:18:20,00:18:22,"No, I'm, I'm on the squad."
265,00:18:22,00:18:23,Oh.
266,00:18:23,00:18:24,"Oh, okay."
267,00:18:25,00:18:26,"Cute girls, short skirts."
268,00:18:26,00:18:28,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it."
269,00:18:28,00:18:29,(chuckles)
270,00:18:29,00:18:31,Did you wait for her after the ballgame the other night?
271,00:18:32,00:18:34,I don't usually see her after Friday night games.
272,00:18:34,00:18:35,She catches a ride home with Ryan.
273,00:18:36,00:18:44,"Hey, Charlie, since you guys are so close you'd know if somebody had it in for her, wouldn't you?"
274,00:18:45,00:18:47,The only person who was ever rude to Megan was Ryan.
275,00:18:47,00:18:48,How rude?
276,00:18:48,00:18:50,Ryan was a dog.
277,00:18:50,00:18:52,And the only person that wouldn't believe that was Megan.
278,00:18:58,00:19:00,High school kid with a van.
279,00:19:00,00:19:03,We could have half the senior class in here.
280,00:19:03,00:19:05,"Yeah, a bunch of minors that won't be in the system."
281,00:19:05,00:19:07,That'll be helpful.
282,00:19:16,00:19:18,Ryan is six feet.
283,00:19:18,00:19:23,Whoever was driving must have adjusted the seat.
284,00:19:23,00:19:24,(grunts)
285,00:19:24,00:19:26,Hello.
286,00:19:26,00:19:28,What you got?
287,00:19:28,00:19:29,I got a cell phone.
288,00:19:29,00:19:30,(camera shutter clicks)
289,00:19:33,00:19:37,"Battery's dead, so I don't know who it belongs to."
290,00:19:37,00:19:40,But something tells me that pink is not Ryan's color.
291,00:19:40,00:19:42,I don't know.
292,00:19:42,00:19:46,I think he might be always thinking pink.
293,00:19:50,00:19:54,"If these all belong to one girl, she's got nothing left to wear."
294,00:19:54,00:20:00,"You know, when I was in college, I had this boyfriend and I thought we were monogamous."
295,00:20:00,00:20:06,"And one night, during the post-coital panty search, he handed me a pair of underwear that wasn't mine."
296,00:20:06,00:20:08,Ooh.
297,00:20:08,00:20:09,How'd he explain that one?
298,00:20:09,00:20:11,He said they belonged to his sister.
299,00:20:11,00:20:13,"Yeah, right. I know."
300,00:20:13,00:20:16,Let's hope your taste in men has improved since then.
301,00:20:18,00:20:22,There's a large rectangular blood pool at the center of the sleeping bag...
302,00:20:22,00:20:27,with several satellite transfers.
303,00:20:29,00:20:32,At each corner...
304,00:20:32,00:20:42,"a four-plus-one pattern consistent with transfer from bloody hands, indicating the body was carried on the sleeping bag."
305,00:20:54,00:20:56,Between ten and 20 semen stains.
306,00:20:57,00:21:00,Some overlaid with blood.
307,00:21:23,00:21:24,Ugh.
308,00:21:24,00:21:27,You okay?
309,00:21:35,00:21:38,Phthirus Pubis.
310,00:21:38,00:21:39,"Yeah, crabs."
311,00:21:39,00:21:42,I am buying Lindsey a chastity belt.
312,00:21:42,00:21:46,There's a hole in the metal to let the urine pass.
313,00:21:46,00:21:47,"So theoretically, she could still get them."
314,00:21:47,00:21:50,You are so creepy sometimes.
315,00:21:50,00:21:56,"You know, the incidence of STDs in monogamous couples is slim."
316,00:21:56,00:21:58,Unless one someone arrives at the party with them.
317,00:21:58,00:22:06,"So assuming they both have pubic lice, if either Megan or Ryan were assaulted, they would have given them to their attacker."
318,00:22:06,00:22:07,A sex pervert with an STD?
319,00:22:08,00:22:10,That's not going to narrow it down.
320,00:22:10,00:22:15,"Yeah, but once they jump to the fresh host, crabs contain the DNA of the receiver and the giver."
321,00:22:15,00:22:18,Did the parents agree to an SAE kit?
322,00:22:18,00:22:20,Yes.
323,00:22:24,00:22:25,You rang?
324,00:22:25,00:22:26,Yes.
325,00:22:26,00:22:28,Found the owner of that cell phone.
326,00:22:28,00:22:29,Megan.
327,00:22:29,00:22:32,Nope. Sheila Latham.
328,00:22:32,00:22:36,What is Megan's best friend's cell phone doing in the front seat of her boyfriend's van?
329,00:22:38,00:22:47,"BOTH: ♪ He wasn't last night. ♪ Hi, hi, I'm sorry I'm late, but, you know, the sun goes down on missing kids and it's news."
330,00:22:48,00:22:52,"I know this sounds awful, but all I keep thinking is: thank God it wasn't Sheila."
331,00:22:52,00:22:53,Doesn't make you a bad person.
332,00:22:55,00:22:58,"(coin clanking) Oh, this, this, this thing is so broken."
333,00:22:58,00:23:00,There's a trick to it. Ah.
334,00:23:00,00:23:01,I lost two dollars in there.
335,00:23:01,00:23:04,"This is Vegas, baby. That's nothing."
336,00:23:04,00:23:06,(can clatters)
337,00:23:06,00:23:07,Thank you.
338,00:23:07,00:23:08,Voila.
339,00:23:08,00:23:09,"Let's go to my office, okay?"
340,00:23:09,00:23:15,"Look, I know you have questions for her, but, you know, Sheila almost lost her best friend yesterday and she's still a little out of it."
341,00:23:15,00:23:18,"No, I get it, and I appreciate you bringing her in."
342,00:23:18,00:23:19,"Hey, Sheila."
343,00:23:19,00:23:21,"See, she's exhausted."
344,00:23:21,00:23:22,"Oh, poor baby."
345,00:23:22,00:23:23,"Sheila, honey."
346,00:23:23,00:23:24,It's time to wake up.
347,00:23:24,00:23:27,Captain Brass is here.
348,00:23:27,00:23:29,Sheila?
349,00:23:30,00:23:33,Sheila?
350,00:23:35,00:23:36,We got a 421!
351,00:23:36,00:23:39,"Somebody run next door and get the squad medics. Wake up, please."
352,00:23:39,00:23:40,(sobbing)
353,00:23:41,00:23:42,"Sheila, honey."
354,00:23:46,00:23:50,I'll tell you it's been a banner week for teens and police.
355,00:23:50,00:23:57,Two kids disappear; one we can't find; one may not make it out of surgery; and another one ends up dead in custody.
356,00:23:57,00:24:01,"I mean, I don't want to make this about me, but I need to know my office is not responsible."
357,00:24:01,00:24:02,Did you hit her over the head?
358,00:24:02,00:24:08,Because COD is epidural hemorrhage caused by a blow to the top of the skull.
359,00:24:09,00:24:14,"The blood clot pushed against the brain, which compressed the respiratory centers."
360,00:24:14,00:24:17,"Her brain stopped telling her body to breathe, and she died."
361,00:24:17,00:24:18,How recent was the injury?
362,00:24:18,00:24:22,I extracted about 150cc's of partially clotted blood.
363,00:24:22,00:24:26,"Would have taken at least a day to form, maybe longer."
364,00:24:26,00:24:31,"Wait, so... Sheila suffered the blow around the same time that Megan and Ryan were, um..."
365,00:24:31,00:24:32,"well, whatever they were."
366,00:24:32,00:24:33,Did her mother mention the injury?
367,00:24:33,00:24:37,"Injury? No. Well, that's not the only secret she was keeping."
368,00:24:37,00:24:41,"She swallowed something rather unusual, and she had crabs."
369,00:24:41,00:24:45,"Well, I can guess where she got those and who she gave them to."
370,00:24:45,00:24:47,What is it that she swallowed?
371,00:24:49,00:24:51,Looks like a memory card from a camera.
372,00:25:47,00:25:52,Looks like the metal connectors got pretty gacked up by the stomach acids.
373,00:25:52,00:25:54,Let's see if it still downloads.
374,00:25:58,00:25:59,"Ah, we're in luck."
375,00:26:02,00:26:05,I'm guessing that's your missing basketball player.
376,00:26:05,00:26:06,Yeah.
377,00:26:06,00:26:07,In the equipment shed.
378,00:26:07,00:26:09,"Look, I don't even know how I got crabs."
379,00:26:09,00:26:12,"GIRL: You got them from humping everything that moved, you big loser."
380,00:26:12,00:26:13,"Now, read."
381,00:26:13,00:26:14,What are you so mad about?
382,00:26:16,00:26:19,"Come on, guys. It's cold in here!"
383,00:26:19,00:26:21,You could at least close the door.
384,00:26:21,00:26:24,"I, Ryan Lansco..."
385,00:26:25,00:26:29,...am a diseased subhuman sex pervert.
386,00:26:29,00:26:35,"If you do me, you'll go home with a souvenir."
387,00:26:35,00:26:37,Your own little crab colony.
388,00:26:37,00:26:39,My parents better never see this!
389,00:26:39,00:26:40,"(scoffing): Oh, yeah?"
390,00:26:40,00:26:45,"This is going up on YouTube, or maybe you'd like to put it on your FriendAgenda page."
391,00:26:45,00:26:48,"You put everything else up there, why not your crotch rot?"
392,00:26:48,00:26:49,Handheld camera.
393,00:26:49,00:26:52,There's a light in the room.
394,00:26:52,00:26:53,Someone opened the door.
395,00:26:53,00:26:56,There's got to be more than one person yanking his chain.
396,00:26:56,00:26:59,"You know, hang on, I can give you one voice comparison right now."
397,00:27:03,00:27:06,"Hi, guys, this is Sheila."
398,00:27:06,00:27:09,"Guess you missed me, but if you leave me a message, I'll get you back."
399,00:27:09,00:27:11,"(voice doubled): Hi, guys, this is Sheila."
400,00:27:16,00:27:18,This is going up on YouTube.
401,00:27:20,00:27:23,"Oh, Sheila."
402,00:27:23,00:27:25,So does that make her a victim or a suspect?
403,00:27:25,00:27:27,Maybe both.
404,00:27:29,00:27:36,"STOKES: Megan, listen, I know you've already been through a lot, but you may be the only one that can tell us what happened to Ryan."
405,00:27:36,00:27:39,Where is he?
406,00:27:39,00:27:42,We don't know.
407,00:27:42,00:27:44,Let's start with the last thing you remember.
408,00:27:45,00:27:47,We were at the game...
409,00:27:47,00:27:49,and I did a perfect hurkey.
410,00:27:49,00:27:52,What's a hurkey?
411,00:27:52,00:27:54,It's a jump where you go...
412,00:28:04,00:28:06,I keep forgetting I can't move my legs.
413,00:28:06,00:28:07,(sobbing)
414,00:28:07,00:28:11,"Mom, you're not helping."
415,00:28:11,00:28:14,Do you remember anything after the game?
416,00:28:14,00:28:15,Anything?
417,00:28:16,00:28:20,We won.
418,00:28:20,00:28:22,Everybody was happy.
419,00:28:27,00:28:29,I remember being really cold.
420,00:28:33,00:28:36,There were lights.
421,00:28:36,00:28:37,And then...
422,00:28:41,00:28:44,Nothing.
423,00:28:44,00:28:46,I'm sorry.
424,00:28:47,00:28:49,(sobbing)
425,00:28:56,00:29:02,"EDDIE LANSCO: If anyone knows anything about our son, please contact the Las Vegas Police."
426,00:29:03,00:29:12,"He's a great kid, with a bright future ahead of him, and we just want him home where he belongs."
427,00:29:15,00:29:25,"""I'm likin' basketball, ""virgin daiquiris, and sweet, sweet ladies."" It's Ryan Lansco's FriendAgenda page."
428,00:29:25,00:29:26,"What's a ""Hit List""?"
429,00:29:26,00:29:31,"Well, his van was like a hot sheets motel, so I don't think he's an assassin."
430,00:29:31,00:29:32,Wants a password.
431,00:29:32,00:29:37,"Try ""Megan."" It's too obvious."
432,00:29:38,00:29:41,I'll try it anyway.
433,00:29:44,00:29:45,(scoffs)
434,00:29:45,00:29:48,Men are never as mysterious as women wish they were.
435,00:29:48,00:29:51,"""Sheila L.-- couldn't move it."
436,00:29:51,00:29:53,"""Bunny B. is a honey bee."
437,00:29:53,00:29:57,"""Diane K. taught me a thing or two."" Diane K."
438,00:29:57,00:29:59,Diane Kentner is his photography teacher.
439,00:30:00,00:30:04,The fingerprint results on Ryan's van.
440,00:30:04,00:30:08,"No hits except on the back door handle, came back to Diane Kentner."
441,00:30:08,00:30:14,She was arrested last year at a demonstration in support of an X-rated photography show.
442,00:30:14,00:30:19,"Now, what's a photography teacher doing touching a student's van?"
443,00:30:19,00:30:21,Maybe she wanted a ride.
444,00:30:21,00:30:33,"Ms. Kentner, the car that hit Megan Cooper left a broken turn signal light in the road."
445,00:30:33,00:30:36,It's from a Saab.
446,00:30:36,00:30:38,Isn't that the car that you drive?
447,00:30:38,00:30:42,"Yeah, along with hundreds of thousands of other Americans."
448,00:30:42,00:30:45,"Well, we're going to need to take a look at yours."
449,00:30:45,00:30:47,Get a warrant and you can.
450,00:30:47,00:30:52,We also found your fingerprint on the door handle of the back of Ryan's van.
451,00:30:52,00:30:56,Could you explain to me how that got there?
452,00:30:56,00:31:01,Well... Ryan helped me move an enlarger I got for the photo lab for the school.
453,00:31:01,00:31:04,My Saab wasn't big enough to move it.
454,00:31:04,00:31:15,"Your name came up on, uh, Ryan Lansco's FriendAgenda page, what was called a ""Hit List."" It's apparently a list of people that he slept with."
455,00:31:15,00:31:17,(laughs)
456,00:31:17,00:31:19,Wow.
457,00:31:19,00:31:26,"If you're under 40 years old and you teach teenage boys, they all want to make you Mrs. Robinson."
458,00:31:26,00:31:29,"It's flattering, but it's fantasy."
459,00:31:29,00:31:34,"So, you are denying that you had any sexual relations with Ryan Lansco?"
460,00:31:34,00:31:37,I would never take advantage of a student.
461,00:31:37,00:31:43,"Well, we're going to need to take a DNA sample, andthatI have a warrant for."
462,00:31:55,00:31:56,My parents better never see this!
463,00:31:57,00:31:58,"Oh, yeah?"
464,00:31:58,00:31:59,This is going up on YouTube.
465,00:32:01,00:32:04,The only reflective surface in this whole frame is that cabinet.
466,00:32:04,00:32:06,"What am I looking at here, Arch?"
467,00:32:06,00:32:08,I'm thinking it's two faces.
468,00:32:08,00:32:11,Only time I can see it is when the light hits it.
469,00:32:13,00:32:13,Sheila.
470,00:32:14,00:32:16,And some dude.
471,00:32:17,00:32:18,Some dude named Charlie.
472,00:32:24,00:32:26,You can grab a cup of coffee.
473,00:32:30,00:32:32,I know you've waived your right to counsel.
474,00:32:32,00:32:35,"I appreciate you coming in here and talking to me, Charlie."
475,00:32:35,00:32:36,That means you're ready to be honest.
476,00:32:37,00:32:38,"That's, that's good."
477,00:32:39,00:32:51,"Because Ryan is still missing, Sheila is now dead, Megan is partially paralyzed, and you are digging yourself into a pretty deep hole here, pal."
478,00:32:51,00:32:55,I know you were there that night in the equipment shed.
479,00:32:55,00:33:06,I have your shoe impressions at the scene; I've got you on film; and we found Sheila's cue cards in the back of her mom's trunk.
480,00:33:06,00:33:07,So...
481,00:33:07,00:33:09,Where's Ryan?
482,00:33:09,00:33:10,I don't know.
483,00:33:10,00:33:13,"You're an adult, Charlie."
484,00:33:13,00:33:17,There's a big difference between going to juvie and going to state prison.
485,00:33:17,00:33:20,Big difference.
486,00:33:20,00:33:23,"Okay, I'll tell you what I think happened."
487,00:33:23,00:33:24,(clears throat)
488,00:33:24,00:33:28,"You're in love with Megan, who's in love with Ryan, who's a dog."
489,00:33:28,00:33:29,You said so yourself.
490,00:33:30,00:33:32,And he gives her crabs.
491,00:33:32,00:33:33,But does she break up with him?
492,00:33:33,00:33:36,No. She goes right back to him after crying on your shoulder.
493,00:33:36,00:33:38,"Man, that'd piss me off."
494,00:33:38,00:33:50,"Don't make me present to a jury that you came up with this plan, this little prank, and recruited Sheila-- equally afflicted by this-- and you ran that boy's head against a tackling sled."
495,00:33:50,00:33:54,"Then when Megan freaked out and got scared, you just ran her over and left her for dead."
496,00:33:54,00:33:56,"No. No, no, that's not what happened."
497,00:33:56,00:33:58,Then you tell me what happened!
498,00:33:59,00:34:02,Okay. You're right.
499,00:34:02,00:34:03,It started as a prank.
500,00:34:04,00:34:06,Sheila and I wrote out that speech.
501,00:34:06,00:34:09,Sheila brought her camera.
502,00:34:09,00:34:12,We went down to the field house.
503,00:34:12,00:34:14,We knew they'd be there fooling around.
504,00:34:16,00:34:17,What the hell?! Shut up!
505,00:34:17,00:34:20,"No, no, no, no. Megan! Megan! Get off me!"
506,00:34:20,00:34:21,Shut up! Stop it!
507,00:34:21,00:34:24,We tied him up.
508,00:34:24,00:34:25,We got him to read the speech.
509,00:34:25,00:34:27,We were just gonna post it on YouTube.
510,00:34:27,00:34:29,What happened?
511,00:34:29,00:34:34,"He got loose, came tearing after us."
512,00:34:36,00:34:38,He's coming. He's coming.
513,00:34:38,00:34:39,You two. (soft grunt)
514,00:34:39,00:34:41,Give me the camera.
515,00:34:47,00:34:48,This what you want?
516,00:34:48,00:34:50,"Huh? Ah, ah, ah."
517,00:34:51,00:34:52,"Ah, ah..."
518,00:34:52,00:34:53,(groaning)
519,00:34:53,00:34:54,"What the heck, man?"
520,00:34:54,00:34:57,(Sheila gagging and coughing)
521,00:35:01,00:35:03,(mock coughs)
522,00:35:03,00:35:05,Jerk!
523,00:35:07,00:35:10,Ryan? Ryan!
524,00:35:10,00:35:13,"CHARLIE: Next thing I know, blood was just gushing out of his neck."
525,00:35:21,00:35:24,I haven't slept.
526,00:35:24,00:35:26,I haven't eaten.
527,00:35:29,00:35:33,I can't stop playing it over and over again in my head.
528,00:35:35,00:35:37,(sobbing)
529,00:35:39,00:35:42,He just went down so fast.
530,00:35:43,00:35:46,And-And I was looking at him.
531,00:35:46,00:35:49,And it-it was like he wasn't Ryan anymore.
532,00:35:52,00:35:53,(sobs)
533,00:35:53,00:35:56,Whatever made him Ryan was gone.
534,00:35:57,00:35:58,What did you do with the body?
535,00:35:58,00:36:00,This is where I suck.
536,00:36:02,00:36:05,"We should have just called 911, but we panicked."
537,00:36:08,00:36:08,(cloth tearing)
538,00:36:09,00:36:11,(groaning) Come on.
539,00:36:11,00:36:13,SHEILA: Shut up and just pull. We don't have time to think about that.
540,00:36:13,00:36:14,What are you doing?
541,00:36:14,00:36:16,"Look, let's just get him in the van."
542,00:36:16,00:36:17,I'll drive; you follow.
543,00:36:17,00:36:19,(groans)
544,00:36:19,00:36:21,Move. Move!
545,00:36:22,00:36:24,Where is Ryan?
546,00:36:24,00:36:26,(sobbing): I just told you everything I know.
547,00:36:26,00:36:27,We left him in the van.
548,00:36:28,00:36:28,What about Megan?
549,00:36:28,00:36:32,"The second we barged into that field house, she freaked out and took off."
550,00:36:32,00:36:36,I-I didn't even know she was in the hospital until her parents called.
551,00:36:36,00:36:38,"Okay, come here and take a look at this."
552,00:36:40,00:36:43,Sheila's holding the camera; you're holding the cue cards.
553,00:36:43,00:36:45,Who's holding the light?
554,00:36:45,00:36:46,Was there somebody else there?
555,00:36:47,00:36:48,Uh-uh.
556,00:36:48,00:36:49,Hmm?
557,00:36:49,00:36:51,I-I was holding the light and the cue card.
558,00:36:51,00:36:53,Are you sure?
559,00:36:53,00:36:56,It was just Sheila and me.
560,00:36:58,00:37:01,"(sobbing): And now, it's just me."
561,00:37:46,00:37:48,"Okay, we got quite the smorgasbord here."
562,00:37:49,00:37:51,"Um, the only constant from the crabs is Ryan."
563,00:37:51,00:37:54,He's half the DNA on each of the combos.
564,00:37:54,00:38:00,"And the other contributors were Megan, Sheila, several unknowns, and everybody's favorite photography teacher, Diane Kentner."
565,00:38:00,00:38:01,Certainly hope she gave him an A.
566,00:38:01,00:38:03,It proves sex with a minor.
567,00:38:03,00:38:07,"Even if we can't get her for Megan's hit-and-run, it's enough for a search warrant."
568,00:38:07,00:38:10,(siren blaring)
569,00:38:10,00:38:12,"(garbled radio transmission) So, what you find at Diane's house?"
570,00:38:12,00:38:18,"Uh, not much, but propped up on a dresser was a rental agreement to this address and a key."
571,00:38:18,00:38:20,Looks like she drew us a map.
572,00:38:20,00:38:21,Looks like it.
573,00:38:21,00:38:23,(garbled radio transmission)
574,00:38:23,00:38:25,"Diane Kentner, open up!"
575,00:38:25,00:38:27,Las Vegas Police!
576,00:38:27,00:38:28,There's our busted headlight.

608,00:40:37,00:40:42,Postmortem photography--memento mori.
609,00:40:42,00:40:46,"In the 19th century, a photo of your dead loved one was a popular keepsake."
610,00:40:46,00:40:49,Death remembered.
611,00:40:49,00:40:50,One last look.
612,00:40:50,00:40:52,"(high-pitched whirring, click)"
613,00:40:52,00:40:53,Hey.
614,00:40:53,00:40:54,"(whirring, click)"
615,00:40:54,00:41:01,Charlie told Nick that Sheila pushed Ryan.
616,00:41:01,00:41:05,BROWN: Charlie lied... to protect Megan.
617,00:41:05,00:41:06,(whirring)
618,00:41:06,00:41:09,How you feeling?
619,00:41:09,00:41:11,"Okay, considering."
620,00:41:11,00:41:15,"Oh, my parents are in the cafeteria if you want to wait."
621,00:41:15,00:41:17,"Oh, no, no, I'm... I'm good."
622,00:41:17,00:41:18,I just wanted to show you something.
623,00:41:21,00:41:23,What do you think about that?
624,00:41:23,00:41:25,Is that me?
625,00:41:25,00:41:28,What am I doing?
626,00:41:28,00:41:30,"Oh, it looks like you're killing your boyfriend."
627,00:41:30,00:41:32,You tell me.
628,00:41:32,00:41:33,Who took this?
629,00:41:34,00:41:36,Ms. Kentner.
630,00:41:36,00:41:37,"Oh, come on. Obsess much?"
631,00:41:37,00:41:39,"Oh, so, you do remember?"
632,00:41:40,00:41:42,No.
633,00:41:42,00:41:44,Not what happened that night.
634,00:41:44,00:41:47,I wish I could get selective amnesia.
635,00:41:47,00:41:50,There's a lot in my past I'd like to forget about.
636,00:41:56,00:42:03,"If I did push Ryan, and he died, then that was wrong."
637,00:42:05,00:42:09,Don't you think that I've been punished enough?
638,00:42:13,00:42:17,EDDIE LANSCO: Are you telling me you're not gonna prosecute the girl that killed my son?
639,00:42:18,00:42:19,The DA decided not to file.
640,00:42:19,00:42:23,"I mean, my guess is that he probably felt he couldn't get a conviction."
641,00:42:23,00:42:25,Wh...
642,00:42:25,00:42:27,Where's the justice in that?
643,00:42:27,00:42:30,Everybody involved in this thing has been punished in some way.
644,00:42:30,00:42:32,"I mean, Diane and Sheila are dead."
645,00:42:32,00:42:34,"Charlie's probably going to jail, and Megan..."
646,00:42:34,00:42:36,Got away with murder.
647,00:43:09,00:43:11,You trust me?
648,00:43:16,00:43:18,Intimately.
