0	00:00:55	00:00:56	What have we got here?
1	00:00:56	00:00:58	Pretty woman.
2	00:00:58	00:00:59	Plenty of room to stretch out.
3	00:00:59	00:01:01	Didn't help her any.
4	00:01:01	00:01:06	No purse, no I.D., but she is wearing a concert wristband.
5	00:01:06	00:01:08	You think that's important? Maybe.
6	00:01:08	00:01:14	According to Sunburst Limo, the owner of this ridiculous 24-seater, a rock band rented it last night.
7	00:01:14	00:01:16	So, maybe our pretty woman's a fan.
8	00:01:16	00:01:18	Who's the band?
9	00:01:18	00:01:19	Limo company said they didn't get a name.
10	00:01:19	00:01:21	Band paid cash.
11	00:01:21	00:01:23	Owner said they were flying under the radar.
12	00:01:23	00:01:24	The driver?
13	00:01:24	00:01:26	At Desert Palm Hospital getting his stomach pumped.
14	00:01:26	00:01:29	Alcohol poisoning, maybe from partying with the band.
15	00:01:29	00:01:33	All we got out of him was that the band stole this limo when he wasn't looking.
16	00:01:33	00:01:37	He pinged it, found it parked in an alley, tried to drive it back.
17	00:01:37	00:01:39	Nick's on his way to the hospital now.
18	00:01:41	00:01:43	That's a lot of blood.
19	00:01:43	00:01:45	Yeah. On her, but not in the limo.
20	00:01:45	00:01:47	I've been through this whole mess.
21	00:01:47	00:01:48	This is not the primary.
22	00:01:48	00:01:50	She was killed somewhere else.
23	00:01:50	00:01:51	Hell of a party. Yeah.
24	00:01:53	00:01:58	You know, Zeppelin once sunk a limo in a hotel pool.
25	00:01:58	00:01:59	No.
26	00:01:59	00:02:00	It was The Who.
27	00:02:00	00:02:01	I'll check both their alibis.
28	00:02:02	00:02:04	You're funny.
29	00:02:04	00:02:08	Whoever they are, the song remains the same.
30	00:02:09	00:02:11	We're gonna find them.
31	00:02:48	00:02:50	Mr. Lassek.
32	00:02:50	00:02:51	I'm Nick Stokes, LVPD.
33	00:02:51	00:02:54	I heard you were driving the limo last night.
34	00:02:54	00:02:58	Yeah. Until one of them ballers in the band stole my ride... my livelihood, man.
35	00:02:58	00:03:00	Okay, which one of the ballers was this?
36	00:03:00	00:03:03	I don't know. There was, like, four of them, and all old dudes.
37	00:03:03	00:03:05	I ain't get any of their names.
38	00:03:05	00:03:06	What else?
39	00:03:06	00:03:08	I think they were rehearsing for, like, a...
40	00:03:08	00:03:10	some secret gig or something like that.
41	00:03:10	00:03:11	What about the girl?
42	00:03:11	00:03:12	What can you tell me about her?
43	00:03:12	00:03:13	Was she partying with the band, or what?
44	00:03:13	00:03:15	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Both of them were.
45	00:03:15	00:03:17	Both of them were. There was more than one?
46	00:03:17	00:03:19	Oh, yeah. There were two of them.
47	00:03:19	00:03:22	See, the girl in the limo, her name's Marcy.
48	00:03:22	00:03:25	See, I picked her up with the band at the Mediterranean.
49	00:03:25	00:03:30	The night ended at the Brimstone Club, and, see, that's where they met up with the other girl...
50	00:03:30	00:03:31	Tangerine.
51	00:03:31	00:03:32	Tangerine?
52	00:03:34	00:03:36	It was crazy.
53	00:03:36	00:03:39	I admit, they put me under the table, literally.
54	00:03:39	00:03:41	Catch anybody's last name?
55	00:03:41	00:03:42	(sighs) I wish.
56	00:03:42	00:03:44	Especially that Tangerine, whoo!
57	00:03:44	00:03:46	She was prime. See, I chatted her up.
58	00:03:46	00:03:50	Uh, and that's when one of them rocker dudes got all crazy with me.
59	00:03:50	00:03:51	Crazy? Crazy, how?
60	00:03:51	00:03:54	Aw, man, he was talking about how he was gonna knock my teeth out if I touched her.
61	00:03:54	00:03:56	I said, Try me then, bitch.
62	00:03:56	00:03:59	You know, and then he backed down like an Otis elevator.
63	00:03:59	00:04:00	Yeah, I got you. That's a good story.
64	00:04:00	00:04:02	But don't leave town, okay? (groans)
65	00:04:02	00:04:05	I'm gonna take that limo for a while, check it out very thoroughly.
66	00:04:45	00:04:48	So what is that anyway?
67	00:04:48	00:04:51	Shiva, the Hindu god of fertility.
68	00:04:51	00:04:53	sex...
69	00:04:53	00:04:55	drugs...
70	00:04:55	00:04:56	and rock and roll.
71	00:04:57	00:05:00	We also have bright green gumballs.
72	00:05:00	00:05:02	Not so rock and roll. Au contraire.
73	00:05:02	00:05:04	Bright green gumballs are very rock and roll.
74	00:05:04	00:05:08	According to this, concert rider rolled into a coke straw.
75	00:05:08	00:05:10	Take a look.
76	00:05:10	00:05:12	The band is referred to as the artist.
77	00:05:12	00:05:15	Backstage needs of each member made very clear.
78	00:05:15	00:05:19	Bassist, one dozen longneck bottles of Chester Garden Red.
79	00:05:19	00:05:20	Check.
80	00:05:20	00:05:23	Drummer, three jars Vienna sausage.
81	00:05:23	00:05:26	Guitarist, one bowl Organi Chew Organic Gumballs.
82	00:05:26	00:05:27	Green tint only.
83	00:05:27	00:05:30	Sounds like Van Halen's concert rider.
84	00:05:30	00:05:32	No brown M&amp;Ms allowed.
85	00:05:32	00:05:35	Yeah, well, these guys are doing more than gum and M&amp;Ms.
86	00:05:35	00:05:36	Could be drugs.
87	00:05:36	00:05:38	I'll get it to Hodges.
88	00:05:38	00:05:41	One girl dead, another one missing.
89	00:05:41	00:05:44	Rock stars, drugs and groupies.
90	00:05:44	00:05:47	Talk about a lethal combination.
91	00:05:47	00:05:52	The victim's C.O.D. appears to be exsanguination due to multiple sharp force injuries.
92	00:05:52	00:05:55	And I found an I.D., as well.
93	00:05:55	00:05:58	Name is Marcy Cody; she's in the system.
94	00:05:58	00:06:00	Arrests for solicitation.
95	00:06:00	00:06:01	So she was a working girl.
96	00:06:01	00:06:03	But I'm not sure she was working last night.
97	00:06:03	00:06:04	Why do you say that?
98	00:06:04	00:06:09	Well, I found no signs of sexual activity, consensual or otherwise.
99	00:06:09	00:06:12	I did find something after I washed away the blood.
100	00:06:12	00:06:18	Something that suggests, whoever our mystery band is, Marcy here was definitely a fan.
101	00:06:18	00:06:22	You know, only big name rock stars leave their signature on that part of the anatomy.
102	00:06:22	00:06:26	If our killer left his autograph, that certainly would be convenient.
103	00:06:26	00:06:29	Indeed, if it were legible.
104	00:06:29	00:06:37	Yeah, the last name's a disaster, but the first letter of the first name, looks like it could be a cursive G.
105	00:06:46	00:06:47	Ay.
106	00:06:48	00:06:50	You do not look happy.
107	00:06:50	00:06:53	I'm having such a tough time with this breast-o-graph.
108	00:06:53	00:06:56	Well, guess I'm having a better day. (sighs)
109	00:06:58	00:07:00	Lexan plastic.
110	00:07:00	00:07:05	Found some ash in it, and apparently it was melted in an ashtray along with a cigarette.
111	00:07:05	00:07:11	I was, however, given my skills, able to reconstitute it, restore it roughly to its original shape.
112	00:07:11	00:07:13	Turns out, it's a guitar pick.
113	00:07:13	00:07:16	Congratulations, but we already know we're looking for a band.
114	00:07:16	00:07:22	Yes, but this is where my good day becomes your good day, because this is a special guitar pick.
115	00:07:22	00:07:26	According to the manufacturer, it's custom-made for one particular rocker.
116	00:07:26	00:07:28	And graced with his signature.
117	00:07:28	00:07:31	Or in this case...
118	00:07:31	00:07:33	what's left of it.
119	00:07:33	00:07:34	That's my G. Mm-hmm.
120	00:07:34	00:07:35	And your S.
121	00:07:35	00:07:37	I didn't know it was an S.
122	00:07:37	00:07:38	I know. You thought it was an H, right?
123	00:07:38	00:07:41	So, I assume the manufacturer has identified the rocker in question?
124	00:07:41	00:07:43	Oh, yes.
125	00:07:43	00:07:46	Now your joy and my joy together are-- wait for it...
126	00:07:47	00:07:49	...locked in a Kiss.
127	00:07:56	00:07:58	Hello, gorgeous.
128	00:07:58	00:08:00	Say, uh, you wouldn't happen to have some, uh, orange juice?
129	00:08:00	00:08:01	I'm a little parched.
130	00:08:01	00:08:02	I don't believe so, sir.
131	00:08:02	00:08:04	Call me Gene.
132	00:08:04	00:08:06	Is this gonna take long?
133	00:08:06	00:08:08	Don't worry, you'll be able to rock and roll all night.
134	00:08:08	00:08:11	(laughs) Hilarious.
135	00:08:11	00:08:12	Funny guy. Sorry.
136	00:08:12	00:08:14	I'm just a big fan. I didn't mean to...
137	00:08:14	00:08:17	What do you say I go in there and, uh, spit some fire?
138	00:08:18	00:08:20	I-I'm just kidding.
139	00:08:20	00:08:21	Let me in. Right. This way.
140	00:08:21	00:08:24	You're a good guy.
141	00:08:24	00:08:25	You know this girl?
142	00:08:25	00:08:28	Let's see.
143	00:08:28	00:08:29	Oh, pretty girl.
144	00:08:29	00:08:34	Yeah, the face looks familiar, but, honestly, I can't place the name.
145	00:08:34	00:08:39	Well, you placed your name on her body in a special place last night.
146	00:08:39	00:08:41	Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. This chick's dead.
147	00:08:41	00:08:43	Whoa-whoa-whoa. Yeah, she's dead.
148	00:08:43	00:08:44	She was murdered.
149	00:08:44	00:08:46	And the body was found in a limo.
150	00:08:46	00:08:49	And in that limo, we found your bass guitar pick.
151	00:08:49	00:08:52	Now that puts you at the scene of the crime.
152	00:08:52	00:08:56	Also in the limo was another young girl named Tangerine.
153	00:08:56	00:08:59	She's missing.
154	00:08:59	00:09:01	I would advise you, Gene, to come clean.
155	00:09:01	00:09:03	Hey, man, I've never been cleaner, okay?
156	00:09:03	00:09:04	I'm gonna lay out what I think happened.
157	00:09:04	00:09:08	You and the Kiss band played a secret gig last night.
158	00:09:08	00:09:12	Played for, like, some prince from Dubai, some Russian gangster.
159	00:09:12	00:09:16	So, in the after-party, some women are involved, things get out of hand, everyone's wasted...
160	00:09:16	00:09:18	Whoa-whoa. Brother, have you got this wrong.
161	00:09:18	00:09:22	I don't drink, I don't do drugs.
162	00:09:22	00:09:23	High people bore me.
163	00:09:23	00:09:27	Another thing is, I sign ta-tas every day.
164	00:09:27	00:09:29	That's my job. That's what I do!
165	00:09:29	00:09:30	I'm a rock star!
166	00:09:30	00:09:34	And another thing is, the Kiss boys and I didn't have any kind of secret gig last night.
167	00:09:34	00:09:36	Okay. How do you explain this then?
168	00:09:36	00:09:39	Your rock and roll party bus.
169	00:09:39	00:09:42	it's not real!
170	00:09:42	00:09:44	It's all part of a package you can buy.
171	00:09:44	00:09:46	Look, it's called The Fame Experience.
172	00:09:46	00:09:54	You know, a bunch of guys get together, they pay heavenly sums to feel famous and to hang out with a rock god like me!
173	00:09:54	00:09:55	The Fame Experience.
174	00:09:55	00:09:57	Okay, so, this gig, it wasn't real.
175	00:09:57	00:10:00	It was, uh, like, theatrical and make-believe?
176	00:10:00	00:10:01	That's right. That's what I'm saying.
177	00:10:01	00:10:05	That the guys that I rocked out with last night weren't even my Kiss brethren.
178	00:10:05	00:10:07	They were some other creatures of the night.
179	00:10:07	00:10:09	Okay, these creatures of the night have names?
180	00:10:09	00:10:10	You wanted it, you got it.
181	00:10:10	00:10:17	On guitar, you got Arnold Borkowski, an accountant from Tulsa, Oklahoma.
182	00:10:17	00:10:19	On drums, Lex Young.
183	00:10:19	00:10:21	He can play.
184	00:10:21	00:10:23	He's an Internet-rich guy-- actually a good guy.
185	00:10:23	00:10:25	A good guy to know.
186	00:10:25	00:10:28	Finally, on bass, Ed Kapena.
187	00:10:28	00:10:29	Ed's from Honolulu.
188	00:10:29	00:10:32	Makes beer with his mom.
189	00:10:32	00:10:36	Lousy bassist, but I do know he can party hard like a rock star.
190	00:10:47	00:10:49	You don't believe me, do you?
191	00:10:49	00:10:52	Look, if you think I'm a killer...
192	00:10:54	00:10:56	...you can kiss my ass.
193	00:11:04	00:11:06	Oh, yes.
194	00:11:08	00:11:11	The Fame Experience.
195	00:11:11	00:11:12	It's kind of sad, huh?
196	00:11:12	00:11:14	Depends on how you look at it.
197	00:11:14	00:11:15	Could be kind of cool, I guess.
198	00:11:15	00:11:18	Up there, living out your dream, rocking onstage.
199	00:11:18	00:11:20	Okay, wait a minute.
200	00:11:20	00:11:22	Don't tell me Nick was a young rocker.
201	00:11:22	00:11:24	High school band.
202	00:11:24	00:11:25	I see you let yourselves in.
203	00:11:25	00:11:27	You must be Marty Kirch.
204	00:11:27	00:11:28	Yeah.
205	00:11:28	00:11:31	I book the bands. I recruit the clients.
206	00:11:31	00:11:33	My friends call me The Cat.
207	00:11:33	00:11:36	Welcome to The Fame Experience.
208	00:11:36	00:11:38	You want to be a singer?
209	00:11:38	00:11:40	An actor?
210	00:11:40	00:11:42	A dancer?
211	00:11:42	00:11:46	If you really want to be a star, you came to the right place.
212	00:11:46	00:11:47	You want to ask me some questions?
213	00:11:47	00:11:49	Yes, sir, Mr. Kirch, we do.
214	00:11:49	00:11:53	Three wannabe rockers on your stage last night backing up Gene Simmons.
215	00:11:53	00:11:55	You're looking at Arnold, Ed and Lex.
216	00:11:55	00:11:58	I should've known that they'd cause trouble.
217	00:11:58	00:12:00	So they did this? Yeah.
218	00:12:00	00:12:03	I came in this morning, I find that they'd destroyed my place.
219	00:12:05	00:12:10	You think those boys did a lot more than trash a hotel room, am I right?
220	00:12:10	00:12:12	Actually, it was a party bus.
221	00:12:12	00:12:13	I believe you know Marcy Cody.
222	00:12:13	00:12:17	We talked to her roommate, and she that you hired her to play groupie last night.
223	00:12:19	00:12:20	Oh, please.
224	00:12:20	00:12:22	What did they do to her?
225	00:12:22	00:12:25	The same thing they may have done to another young lady.
226	00:12:25	00:12:28	A young lady that you may have hired.
227	00:12:28	00:12:30	Goes by the name Tangerine.
228	00:12:30	00:12:32	I didn't hire anybody else.
229	00:12:32	00:12:36	I hired Marcy. She was a sweet, kind kid.
230	00:12:36	00:12:40	Okay, whatever you want me to do...
231	00:12:40	00:12:41	I'll make it happen.
232	00:12:41	00:12:46	I think we can start by trying to figure out where those three guys were staying.
233	00:12:46	00:12:50	And we're gonna need to take a tour of your experience.
234	00:13:07	00:13:10	I got a bloody knife.
235	00:13:38	00:13:40	So, we have two distinct blood events.
236	00:13:42	00:13:44	You thinking what I'm thinking?
237	00:13:44	00:13:46	Got to be the two girls.
238	00:13:46	00:13:51	Stage left, pattern and blood voids are consistent with Marcy Cody's stabbing.
239	00:13:51	00:14:03	Yeah, and over here, I've got directional blood drops on the amp that come all the way back from center stage, where we've got high-velocity spatter radiating outward.
240	00:14:03	00:14:04	That's an odd void in the middle.
241	00:14:04	00:14:07	It's like somebody just... exploded.
242	00:14:07	00:14:10	What the hell happened in here?
243	00:14:15	00:14:17	Arnold Borkowski.
244	00:14:17	00:14:20	Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the rocker type.
245	00:14:20	00:14:21	Oh, rocker by night.
246	00:14:21	00:14:23	Uh, accountant by day.
247	00:14:23	00:14:27	Uh-huh. I'm really out here just for a, uh, a CPA conference.
248	00:14:27	00:14:30	The Fame Experience was all Lex's idea, really.
249	00:14:30	00:14:31	Lex? Lex Young?
250	00:14:31	00:14:34	Yeah, yeah, um, our drummer and-and lead singer.
251	00:14:34	00:14:39	Lex, uh, Ed and I had a-a band in college.
252	00:14:39	00:14:41	Darwin's Monkey. (chuckles)
253	00:14:42	00:14:51	So, anyway, uh, a few months ago, Lex contacted us and thought it would be cool if we got the band back together.
254	00:14:51	00:14:52	The whole thing was kind of a lark.
255	00:14:52	00:14:54	A lark, Arnold?
256	00:14:54	00:14:58	Yeah, I don't think it was a lark for Marcy Cody.
257	00:15:00	00:15:04	And I don't think it was a lark for her friend Tangerine, either.
258	00:15:04	00:15:07	Look, I wasn't the one partying with those girls, okay?
259	00:15:07	00:15:15	If it was up to me, we'd have spent all our time in the studio, jamming, not partying, because for me, it was all about the music, man.
260	00:15:15	00:15:16	And what about your bandmates?
261	00:15:16	00:15:19	Was it all about the music for them, too?
262	00:15:19	00:15:23	Hey, look, this whole thing was, like, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, you know?
263	00:15:23	00:15:25	Come on.
264	00:15:25	00:15:28	Who doesn't want to jam out with Gene Simmons?
265	00:15:28	00:15:32	Mr. Kapena, I don't think you understand what kind of trouble you could be in.
266	00:15:32	00:15:35	Okay, look, I confess, all right?
267	00:15:35	00:15:43	I smoked a little weed, I did a couple bumps, but I didn't stab any hooker, or hookers, last night.
268	00:15:43	00:15:45	I mean, I didn't...
269	00:15:45	00:15:47	didn't get any action at all.
270	00:15:47	00:15:48	Who did?
271	00:15:48	00:15:53	Same guy who always does, even when we were back in college.
272	00:15:53	00:15:55	We should've done an encore.
273	00:15:55	00:15:56	We should've did them.
274	00:15:56	00:15:58	How does he do it?
275	00:15:58	00:16:02	I guess he thinks he can do every girl the way he thinks he can play every instrument.
276	00:16:02	00:16:04	He kind of can.
277	00:16:04	00:16:06	You really don't know anything about music, do you?
278	00:16:09	00:16:14	So, you're telling me that your buddy Lex snagged the keys to the limo and then stole your dates?
279	00:16:14	00:16:16	They weren't our dates.
280	00:16:16	00:16:18	B-But yeah, he-he took our ride.
281	00:16:18	00:16:20	I didn't care.
282	00:16:20	00:16:22	I mean, there's plenty of fish in the sea, right?
283	00:16:23	00:16:25	You ever been to the Brimstone Club?
284	00:16:25	00:16:27	So you stayed at the bar?
285	00:16:27	00:16:28	Yeah.
286	00:16:28	00:16:30	And Arnold?
287	00:16:30	00:16:34	I've known Lex since college, but we're not really good friends.
288	00:16:34	00:16:38	I mean, do you think he could've done this?
289	00:16:40	00:16:42	Do you recognize this knife?
290	00:16:42	00:16:44	Yeah, that's Lex's knife.
291	00:16:44	00:16:47	Your buddy Lex didn't return to the hotel last night.
292	00:16:47	00:16:49	Do you know where we can find him?
293	00:16:49	00:16:50	I've been calling Lex all day.
294	00:16:50	00:16:51	Nothing.
295	00:16:54	00:16:56	This whole thing doesn't make any sense.
296	00:16:56	00:16:58	Why do you say that?
297	00:16:58	00:17:01	(sighs) Okay, so, like, last night, Lex was on top of the world, you know.
298	00:17:01	00:17:02	It wasn't just chicks.
299	00:17:02	00:17:08	I mean, the first night we got here, he came in, he went in the studio, he recorded one of his songs.
300	00:17:08	00:17:12	And I guess some producer heard it, and now a label's interested in signing him.
301	00:17:12	00:17:13	Really?
302	00:17:13	00:17:15	A record contract?
303	00:17:19	00:17:22	So this guy Lex Young-- he's our prime suspect?
304	00:17:22	00:17:24	According to his bandmates.
305	00:17:24	00:17:27	And he's also been arrested twice for assault.
306	00:17:27	00:17:31	But it looks like he really did have interest from a record label.
307	00:17:31	00:17:35	A $1,000 deposit from Cogitator Music International?
308	00:17:35	00:17:38	I put a trap on Lex Young's credit cards.
309	00:17:38	00:17:43	No charges since he dropped a grand on champagne at the Brimstone Club.
310	00:17:43	00:17:46	So if our rock star's on the run, he's not leaving any tracks.
311	00:17:46	00:17:48	What about this missing person, Tangerine?
312	00:17:48	00:17:50	Well, no word on her yet, either.
313	00:17:50	00:17:57	And her killer did a good job cleaning up, 'cause Henry wasn't able to develop any DNA profiles from the crime scene.
314	00:17:57	00:18:02	Now, Nick and Sara are pretty sure that that blood event is consistent with Marcy Cody's injuries.
315	00:18:02	00:18:03	Okay.
316	00:18:03	00:18:05	What about this one?
317	00:18:05	00:18:06	Your guess is as good as mine.
318	00:18:06	00:18:11	I've seen a lot of weird blood patterns, but I have no idea what's going on there.
319	00:18:11	00:18:13	Okay. (sharp banging)
320	00:18:13	00:18:15	What is that, ballistics?
321	00:18:17	00:18:20	Actually, that sounds like it was coming from the garage.
322	00:18:29	00:18:31	Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
323	00:18:31	00:18:32	Dude!
324	00:18:32	00:18:34	What are you doing, man?
325	00:18:34	00:18:35	Hi.
326	00:18:35	00:18:37	Sorry about the mess.
327	00:18:37	00:18:41	We can blame it on my insomnia and late-night TV marathons.
328	00:18:41	00:18:47	Have you ever seen the documentary on The Who where Keith Moon hits the drum and it looks like glitter comes jumping off of it?
329	00:18:47	00:18:48	No.
330	00:18:48	00:18:55	In that documentary, they pour water into his drum kit, and then during the solo, they light up the spray as it just leaps up off the drum.
331	00:18:55	00:19:01	So, I think, I hope, I'm duplicating the blood pattern from the crime scene. What do you think?
332	00:19:05	00:19:07	I'll be damned.
333	00:19:07	00:19:09	All right, back up, though.
334	00:19:09	00:19:11	How do you figure the blood got on that drum in the first place?
335	00:19:11	00:19:12	From Lex Young.
336	00:19:12	00:19:22	I think the combination of the alcohol, the cocaine, the pills, him thinking he has a music deal, put that in combination with the adrenaline of being onstage, he thought at some point that he was a rock god.
337	00:19:22	00:19:24	Rock goddesses were gonna fall from the sky.
338	00:19:24	00:19:26	No, thanks!
339	00:19:26	00:19:28	But when they weren't in the mood, he got enraged.
340	00:19:31	00:19:32	Oh, my God!
341	00:19:34	00:19:36	And then he just went back to playing.
342	00:19:43	00:19:45	But we still have a lot of it left to do.
343	00:19:45	00:19:48	We didn't find a bloody drum kit at the crime scene.
344	00:19:48	00:19:49	Any ideas?
345	00:19:49	00:19:54	Well, we might find the drums in the same place we find Tangerine.
346	00:19:58	00:19:59	(groans) This place reeks.
347	00:19:59	00:20:02	Really? I hadn't noticed.
348	00:20:03	00:20:05	Well, at least we're in the right place.
349	00:20:05	00:20:08	Driver said he found the limo bus a block that way.
350	00:20:08	00:20:11	The Fame Experience studio is just around the corner.
351	00:20:11	00:20:13	Definitely promising.
352	00:20:20	00:20:21	Hey.
353	00:20:28	00:20:30	It's a drumstick.
354	00:20:30	00:20:31	With blood on it.
355	00:20:34	00:20:35	You see that?
356	00:20:38	00:20:39	Throw this over there?
357	00:20:39	00:20:41	Yeah.
358	00:20:58	00:21:01	Bloody drum and a very bad smell.
359	00:21:06	00:21:09	That's Lex Young, the drummer.
360	00:21:09	00:21:10	So much for our prime suspect.
361	00:21:10	00:21:14	The Fame Experience is becoming more like Hotel California.
362	00:21:14	00:21:18	You can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave.
363	00:21:24	00:21:28	Our drummer, Mr. Lex Young, sustained at least eight sharp-force injuries.
364	00:21:28	00:21:33	Wounds are consistent with the stiletto knife found at the crime scene.
365	00:21:33	00:21:36	Henry processed the blood on the drum?
366	00:21:36	00:21:39	Yeah. It's definitely Mr. Young's.
367	00:21:39	00:21:42	Got a wallet, Doc.
368	00:21:42	00:21:44	Phone too.
369	00:21:46	00:21:49	Looks like he made some friends while he was in town.
370	00:21:51	00:21:52	One friend in particular.
371	00:21:54	00:21:58	Ooh, boy, that's Tangerine, our missing girl.
372	00:21:58	00:22:00	Maybe they made a love connection.
373	00:22:00	00:22:05	Although, if she was a working girl, it was probably one-sided.
374	00:22:05	00:22:07	Torn up pieces of paper in his wallet.
375	00:22:07	00:22:09	Must've meant something to him.
376	00:22:12	00:22:15	That looks like a lyric sheet, handwritten.
377	00:22:17	00:22:20	Long Road Home, a song by Lex Young.
378	00:22:20	00:22:22	He scribbled a dedication underneath.
379	00:22:22	00:22:24	For Tangerine.
380	00:22:24	00:22:28	I doubt Mr. Young tore up his own song.
381	00:22:28	00:22:30	That's bad for him, good for us.
382	00:22:30	00:22:34	Yeah, 'cause if Tangerine tore it up, that means she touched it.
383	00:22:34	00:22:36	Long Road Home could be a short road to finding her.
384	00:23:07	00:23:10	So, we got an I.D. on Tangerine.
385	00:23:10	00:23:12	Surprise, surprise, it's not her real name.
386	00:23:12	00:23:14	Angela Glenn.
387	00:23:14	00:23:18	Arrests for solicitation, pandering and fraud.
388	00:23:18	00:23:20	At first, we thought she was our next victim.
389	00:23:20	00:23:24	Turns out, she may have been involved in the murders of Marcy Cody and Lex Young.
390	00:23:24	00:23:27	All right, tell me what you got.
391	00:23:27	00:23:32	Well, let's start with Lex Young's phone and a series of photos of him with Tangerine.
392	00:23:32	00:23:35	And the time stamp says that they first met six days ago.
393	00:23:35	00:23:37	When The Fame Experience started.
394	00:23:37	00:23:40	A dream come true, right? Lex Young meets his muse.
395	00:23:40	00:23:45	That night, he goes home and writes and records a song dedicated to her.
396	00:23:45	00:23:47	And then, poof, all of a sudden, he's got a record deal.
397	00:23:47	00:23:48	Yeah, what are the odds of that happening?
398	00:23:48	00:23:50	100-to-one it's a scam. Yeah.
399	00:23:50	00:23:52	And we've got a lead on who might be behind it.
400	00:23:52	00:23:57	Couple of hours ago, a check transaction cleared Lex Young's personal account.
401	00:23:57	00:24:01	$50,000 written to Cogitator Music International.
402	00:24:01	00:24:04	Deposited by the owner himself, one Alex Gradenko.
403	00:24:04	00:24:07	I'm assuming you've checked up on the label.
404	00:24:07	00:24:09	Yeah, it's an offshore account in Belize.
405	00:24:09	00:24:11	Belize!
406	00:24:11	00:24:13	Which brings us to Lex Young's e-mail.
407	00:24:13	00:24:17	He and Gradenko have been communicating for the past four days.
408	00:24:17	00:24:21	Mr. Young, your demo is incredible.
409	00:24:21	00:24:23	Excited to meet you in person finally.
410	00:24:23	00:24:29	However, we have a problem with our digital distribution that has resulted in unexpected costs.
411	00:24:29	00:24:36	We will need $50,000 to avoid any unwanted delay in the release of your single.
412	00:24:36	00:24:39	That sounds like your classic Nigerian e-mail scam.
413	00:24:39	00:24:41	You give us a little now, we'll give you so much more later.
414	00:24:41	00:24:44	You know that thousand dollars that Lex Young received from Cogitator Music?
415	00:24:44	00:24:46	Right. That was just the come-on.
416	00:24:46	00:24:50	Like a sweet young Tangerine fawning over an aging, wannabe rock star.
417	00:24:50	00:24:53	Okay, so how does the con turn into murder?
418	00:24:53	00:25:01	Well, I'm thinking that the torn lyric sheet that we found says that Tangerine, at some point, maybe lost her stomach for the grift.
419	00:25:01	00:25:03	And maybe even started to feel for her mark.
420	00:25:03	00:25:09	So, Lex Young realizes maybe that he's being conned, so he confronts Gradenko back at the studio.
421	00:25:09	00:25:11	Gradenko kills him to cover up the scam.
422	00:25:11	00:25:13	And Marcy Cody's just collateral damage.
423	00:25:13	00:25:17	Okay, what about, uh, Tangerine? Her neighbors say she hasn't been around for a couple days.
424	00:25:17	00:25:21	So we have a broadcast out on her car and we're sitting on her place.
425	00:25:21	00:25:23	If I were her, I'd be in the wind.
426	00:25:23	00:25:27	(phone chimes) If I were this guy Gradenko, I'd be in the wind, too.
427	00:25:27	00:25:29	Uh, maybe not.
428	00:25:31	00:25:37	I.S.P. trace we ran on Gradenko's e-mails to Lex Young came back to Vegas, not Belize.
429	00:25:37	00:25:41	And to a cat we all know.
430	00:25:41	00:25:43	Marty The Cat Kirch.
431	00:25:43	00:25:44	Pleasure to meet you.
432	00:25:44	00:25:45	Captain Jim Brass. How are you?
433	00:25:45	00:25:48	Or maybe I should say... (speaks Russian)
434	00:25:48	00:25:50	Comrade Gradenko.
435	00:25:50	00:25:51	Captain, I can explain this...
436	00:25:51	00:25:53	No, no, no.
437	00:25:53	00:25:55	No explanation necessary, really. This, you know...
438	00:25:55	00:25:57	You got a really nice side business here.
439	00:25:57	00:25:59	The company provides a taste of fame.
440	00:25:59	00:26:05	And you provide to would-be rockers the dream of Alex Gradenko, record producer, right?
441	00:26:05	00:26:12	Some poor schmuck gets to dream of being discovered and getting a record deal and becoming famous; it's kind of slick.
442	00:26:12	00:26:15	Exactly. That's why I invented Alexander Gradenko.
443	00:26:15	00:26:17	The world's best record producer, right?
444	00:26:17	00:26:20	Just like you said, it's like selling dreams.
445	00:26:20	00:26:23	Yeah. It's called fraud, Marty.
446	00:26:23	00:26:28	I don't understand. Well, you know, Lex young understood; he understood the reality that you had scammed him for 50 grand.
447	00:26:28	00:26:30	And now he's dead.
448	00:26:30	00:26:32	Wait a minute. I mean, you got it all wrong.
449	00:26:32	00:26:34	Are you saying that I killed Lex Young? Did you?
450	00:26:34	00:26:38	And what about Marcy Cody? I mean, geez, that poor kid just got in the way, I guess.
451	00:26:38	00:26:39	That poor kid was like a daughter to me.
452	00:26:39	00:26:41	You know, we're gonna find the other girl, Tangerine.
453	00:26:41	00:26:45	We're gonna find her dead or alive, and when we do, she's gonna have a story to tell.
454	00:26:45	00:26:51	Well, I sincerely hope you do find her, because the story that she's gonna tell you is that I didn't hire her.
455	00:26:51	00:26:54	Lex Young hired her.
456	00:26:54	00:26:55	Lex Young? Really?
457	00:26:55	00:26:57	I thought you hired all the groupies.
458	00:26:57	00:27:03	Captain, when you're a client and you go off the menu, I'm not gonna stop you.
459	00:27:03	00:27:12	So if you're looking for what happened to Lex and Marcy, maybe you need to look at Tangerine and not me. Why's that?
460	00:27:12	00:27:15	Because he had that hooker on his arm all weekend long.
461	00:27:15	00:27:17	The last day of it, they had this massive fight.
462	00:27:17	00:27:19	That's why. Oh, really?
463	00:27:19	00:27:20	Do you know what it was about?
464	00:27:20	00:27:21	I have no idea.
465	00:27:21	00:27:24	But to me... it's always about money.
466	00:27:24	00:27:27	Yeah.
467	00:27:27	00:27:30	Well, for me, it's always about the crime.
468	00:27:30	00:27:32	And you're under arrest, Marty, for fraud.
469	00:27:32	00:27:33	For now.
470	00:27:38	00:27:40	So, do you believe his story?
471	00:27:40	00:27:45	I don't believe a thing that guy says. Well, truth is, we didn't find any evidence that put him in the room at the time of the murders, so...
472	00:27:45	00:27:51	And the only people who were there that night are either dead, or in the wind, or dead. Captain?
473	00:27:51	00:27:53	You got a visitor. He said that it's important.
474	00:27:53	00:27:54	Oh, yeah?
475	00:27:54	00:27:57	Actually, he says he's important.
476	00:27:57	00:27:58	Captain, permission to board?
477	00:27:58	00:28:01	Permission granted, Sailor.
478	00:28:01	00:28:02	So you've met Officer Mitchell?
479	00:28:02	00:28:04	Yes, sir.
480	00:28:04	00:28:06	That's CSI Russell. This is Gene Simmons.
481	00:28:06	00:28:07	Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
482	00:28:07	00:28:09	Hey. Yeah, nice to meet you.
483	00:28:09	00:28:11	Wife's a huge fan of your, um...
484	00:28:11	00:28:13	reality show.
485	00:28:13	00:28:16	Oh. What about you?
486	00:28:16	00:28:20	Uh, I'm more of a Nature Channel kind of guy.
487	00:28:20	00:28:24	Oh, nature's cool. So, Gene, what brings you by? You paying a parking ticket?
488	00:28:24	00:28:26	I bring you treasure.
489	00:28:26	00:28:29	But first, a little DNA for your Q and A. Oh.
490	00:28:29	00:28:31	I watch a lot of cop shows.
491	00:28:31	00:28:35	Okay, so... so, what's, uh... what's the story behind these?
492	00:28:35	00:28:37	Well, here's the deal.
493	00:28:37	00:28:39	See, this girl gets my number the other night.
494	00:28:39	00:28:42	And, uh, I'm a gent.
495	00:28:42	00:28:44	I never say no.
496	00:28:44	00:28:49	Lo and behold, the phone goes off this morning, and it's her, and she says, Uh, hi. Do you remember me?
497	00:28:49	00:28:52	And I say, uh, Honestly, no.
498	00:28:52	00:28:55	And she says, How can you forget a name like Tangerine?
499	00:28:59	00:29:00	Where is she now?
500	00:29:00	00:29:02	Outside in my limo.
501	00:29:02	00:29:04	Take her down. I'll call you.
502	00:29:04	00:29:05	Thank you very much, Gene.
503	00:29:09	00:29:12	I'm always at the service of law enforcement.
504	00:29:15	00:29:18	She doesn't look like she could do it.
505	00:29:18	00:29:20	Then again, she did take a swing at Gene Simmons.
506	00:29:20	00:29:22	Well, that's not a huge surprise.
507	00:29:22	00:29:23	He dimed her out.
508	00:29:23	00:29:25	Doesn't make her a murderer.
509	00:29:25	00:29:28	So your money's on, what, Marty The Cat?
510	00:29:28	00:29:29	I don't know.
511	00:29:29	00:29:35	Do you really think a falling out between a hooker and a john could turn into such a brutal homicide?
512	00:29:35	00:29:37	Committed by the hooker?
513	00:29:37	00:29:42	This kid, what, goes into a rage, wants to drum the john out of this world?
514	00:29:42	00:29:44	(phone chimes) Oh, seen crazier things.
515	00:29:44	00:29:45	True.
516	00:29:45	00:29:47	We need a why, D.B.
517	00:29:47	00:29:50	I think we just got it.
518	00:29:50	00:29:52	Text from Henry.
519	00:29:52	00:29:54	Okay.
520	00:29:56	00:29:57	Been sitting here an hour.
521	00:29:57	00:30:00	It's costing me money. You wanted to talk?
522	00:30:00	00:30:02	So, talk. Or arrest me.
523	00:30:02	00:30:04	Do something, so I can just get the hell out of here.
524	00:30:04	00:30:05	You're not going anywhere!
525	00:30:05	00:30:08	You think you're here for solicitation?
526	00:30:08	00:30:11	You're here for this, and you're here for this.
527	00:30:11	00:30:14	Now, we've done our homework; we know your story.
528	00:30:14	00:30:16	You had a single mom who left you in foster care.
529	00:30:16	00:30:20	You grew up as a ward of the state in a state-fun facility.
530	00:30:20	00:30:22	It's a tough place.
531	00:30:22	00:30:26	I'd say you see people really at their worst in places like that.
532	00:30:26	00:30:29	You also grow up with a propensity for violence.
533	00:30:29	00:30:30	Would you agree with me?
534	00:30:30	00:30:33	Look, Tangerine, we ran your DNA.
535	00:30:33	00:30:39	You may not share Mr. Young's last name, but you do share 13 genetic markers with the guy.
536	00:30:41	00:30:44	He's your father.
537	00:30:44	00:30:45	But then, you knew that, didn't you?
538	00:30:45	00:30:47	Guy hires you for a week.
539	00:30:47	00:30:51	Somewhere down the line, you realize that he's your father.
540	00:30:51	00:30:53	How'd you find out the truth?
541	00:30:53	00:30:55	So, you're in the hotel room with Lex Young.
542	00:30:55	00:31:01	He starts telling you a story how he came to Vegas, he met a woman, he had an infant daughter, and he abandoned that little girl?
543	00:31:01	00:31:04	And somehow, you pieced together that that little girl was you?
544	00:31:04	00:31:06	I mean, we understand.
545	00:31:06	00:31:08	Hell, a jury would understand.
546	00:31:08	00:31:12	Of course you went a little crazy when you found out the guy you were sleeping with was your father.
547	00:31:12	00:31:14	That's not what happened!
548	00:31:14	00:31:15	Okay, look, we just want to help you out here.
549	00:31:15	00:31:18	I didn't sleep with my father.
550	00:31:18	00:31:19	I didn't kill him.
551	00:31:19	00:31:21	Or anyone.
552	00:31:23	00:31:26	You people don't know... anything.
553	00:31:26	00:31:28	Well, then tell us what we should know.
554	00:31:30	00:31:32	Look, I thought he was just some rich guy.
555	00:31:32	00:31:35	Okay, he hired me for the week, another date.
556	00:31:35	00:31:36	Until it wasn't.
557	00:31:36	00:31:38	Tangerine.
558	00:31:38	00:31:40	That's a pretty name. I like it.
559	00:31:40	00:31:41	Do you want to know how you got it?
560	00:31:41	00:31:47	My mom told me it was a nickname my dad gave me when I was little, before he took off.
561	00:31:47	00:31:48	I'm sorry about that.
562	00:31:48	00:31:50	Hey, it's...
563	00:31:50	00:31:51	it's not your fault.
564	00:31:51	00:31:52	It is.
565	00:31:52	00:31:54	(scoffs) What?
566	00:31:54	00:31:56	I came to Vegas for you.
567	00:31:56	00:32:02	There's no way for me to make right what I did, but... I want to try.
568	00:32:03	00:32:05	What are you talking about?
569	00:32:05	00:32:11	I've never been very good with words; there's, um, only one way that I've been able to express myself.
570	00:32:11	00:32:13	What the hell is this?
571	00:32:13	00:32:15	It's something I wrote for you.
572	00:32:15	00:32:17	It's a song.
573	00:32:18	00:32:19	When was this?
574	00:32:19	00:32:21	Monday night.
575	00:32:21	00:32:22	Monday night? Wait a minute.
576	00:32:22	00:32:24	I don't... I don't get this.
577	00:32:24	00:32:34	Tuesday night, the next night, you were seen leaving the Brimstone Club with Marcy Cody and your father, and you were all friendly, and then one hour later, they're both dead?
578	00:32:34	00:32:36	I mean, help me understand that.
579	00:32:36	00:32:37	My dad came back to the club that night.
580	00:32:37	00:32:39	He apologized.
581	00:32:39	00:32:41	I mean, my mom's dead.
582	00:32:41	00:32:42	I didn't think I had anyone.
583	00:32:44	00:32:47	It's something I fantasized about since I was a little girl.
584	00:32:47	00:32:49	You know, my dad coming back to us.
585	00:32:49	00:32:52	I never thought it would take this long, but...
586	00:32:52	00:32:55	He said he just wanted the chance to play me the song.
587	00:32:56	00:32:59	And that girl, Marcy, she just wanted to get out of the club.
588	00:32:59	00:33:03	So my dad got the keys to the limo, and we went back to the studio.
589	00:33:03	00:33:06	What happened then?
590	00:33:06	00:33:07	My dad played me the song.
591	00:33:08	00:33:10	It was nice.
592	00:33:11	00:33:13	Said a producer was interested.
593	00:33:13	00:33:18	He'd heard the demo and wanted my dad to record another with backup vocals.
594	00:33:18	00:33:22	My dad said someone was gonna come by the studio later and help him out.
595	00:33:22	00:33:27	I wished him luck, and I left.
596	00:33:29	00:33:30	I swear...
597	00:33:32	00:33:35	...my dad and Marcy were alive when I walked out of there.
598	00:33:43	00:33:48	So, these are the recordings from The Fame Experience studio, huh?
599	00:33:48	00:33:49	Marty Kirch turned them over.
600	00:33:49	00:33:51	Must be some great listening.
601	00:33:51	00:33:54	(chuckles) I can load them onto your iPod, if you like.
602	00:33:54	00:33:55	No, thanks.
603	00:33:55	00:34:01	The important song is the one 12 the night of the murder.
604	00:34:04	00:34:06	That's Lex Young singing.
605	00:34:06	00:34:08	Mm-hmm. And playing guitar.
606	00:34:08	00:34:11	He put both of those on the same track, track one.
607	00:34:11	00:34:13	What about the background vocals?
608	00:34:13	00:34:15	His daughter said that another vocalist was going to help.
609	00:34:15	00:34:18	Well, it looks like there were no other recordings. But...
610	00:34:18	00:34:21	look at the waveform on this one.
611	00:34:21	00:34:23	I think I can isolate the background noise.
612	00:34:27	00:34:29	Sounds like another voice.
613	00:34:29	00:34:31	It sounds like singing.
614	00:34:34	00:34:36	What are you thinking?
615	00:34:36	00:34:41	Well, an omnidirectional microphone can pick up a lot of extraneous audio.
616	00:34:41	00:34:46	So you're thinking that someone was there recording vocals.
617	00:34:46	00:34:47	Maybe our killer.
618	00:34:47	00:34:49	And they erased their track.
619	00:34:49	00:34:52	But their vocals still bled onto track one.
620	00:34:52	00:34:56	(sighs) Well, I'm not sure we have enough here to be able to identify the voice.
621	00:34:56	00:34:57	We've got the microphone.
622	00:34:57	00:35:01	Maybe we don't have to.
623	00:35:42	00:35:44	We know you were there, Arnold.
624	00:35:44	00:35:46	That night onstage singing backup.
625	00:35:46	00:35:48	Your DNA's all over that microphone.
626	00:35:48	00:35:54	Respectfully-- a-and I don't mean to tell you your job-- but my DNA on that microphone proves nothing.
627	00:35:54	00:35:56	I-I was singing into that mic all week long.
628	00:35:56	00:35:59	I know. You know how I know?
629	00:36:00	00:36:03	Organi Chew Organic Gumballs.
630	00:36:03	00:36:06	Green tint kind of proves it was you.
631	00:36:06	00:36:08	This is the color you like, right?
632	00:36:08	00:36:11	I read your band's rider. I know you're the gumball guy.
633	00:36:11	00:36:15	Found quite a few particles of it in that microphone.
634	00:36:15	00:36:18	And since you know how to do my job so well...
635	00:36:20	00:36:22	I'm sure you know what that is, right?
636	00:36:22	00:36:24	Um... It's a trace report.
637	00:36:24	00:36:25	You know what that tells me?
638	00:36:25	00:36:29	That tells me that the gum contains xylitol.
639	00:36:29	00:36:32	You know what xylitol is? It's an organic sweetener.
640	00:36:32	00:36:33	It comes from corn.
641	00:36:33	00:36:36	Which is really good for us. It can tell us a whole lot.
642	00:36:36	00:36:40	'Cause thanks to you, you left a whole lot of it on that microphone.
643	00:36:42	00:36:46	You see, xylitol breaks down in a very predictable way.
644	00:36:46	00:36:51	And when measured in concentrated levels, it can give me a very specific timeline.
645	00:36:51	00:36:57	You think of this gum, when chewed, as a... as a body decomposing.
646	00:36:57	00:37:01	Oxygen dissipates, muscles stiffen at a certain rate.
647	00:37:01	00:37:04	That's what gives us the time of death.
648	00:37:04	00:37:10	In your case, that's what gives us the, well... time of song.
649	00:37:10	00:37:19	The last few particles that I found in that microphone put you at the crime scene during the time of the murders, Arnold.
650	00:37:19	00:37:21	So, here's what I think happened.
651	00:37:21	00:37:31	I think that after Tangerine left, you waltzed in, and Lex was all too happy, because he needed a little help with the background vocals.
652	00:37:31	00:37:32	Am I right?
653	00:37:34	00:37:36	It's always background. Yeah, yeah.
654	00:37:36	00:37:37	How's that make you feel?
655	00:37:37	00:37:38	Makes me really mad.
656	00:37:38	00:37:40	Pisses you off, right? Yeah.
657	00:37:40	00:37:43	You get more and more mad with every passing verse. Mm-hmm.
658	00:37:43	00:37:45	And he's like, what, uh, Stop, do it again.
659	00:37:45	00:37:47	This time, with more feeling. Bastard!
660	00:37:47	00:37:49	He thought he was Phil Collins, you know?
661	00:37:49	00:37:51	But I was better than he was.
662	00:37:51	00:37:54	I was the heart and soul of Darwin's Monkey.
663	00:37:54	00:38:00	But Lex always had to call the shots-- when we broke up, when we got back together, even this whole...
664	00:38:00	00:38:02	Fame Experience crap.
665	00:38:02	00:38:05	I was sick of it, you know? And I told him so!
666	00:38:07	00:38:10	Arnold, what's your problem?
667	00:38:10	00:38:12	You. You're my problem.
668	00:38:12	00:38:13	You want to be front man?
669	00:38:13	00:38:17	Lead? Your entire existence is background.
670	00:38:17	00:38:19	Now let's go again.
671	00:38:25	00:38:27	I won't tell anybody!
672	00:38:27	00:38:29	No! (screams)
673	00:38:36	00:38:39	And afterwards, you dumped her body in the limo and...
674	00:38:39	00:38:42	disposed of Lex's body where we wouldn't find it, right?
675	00:38:42	00:38:45	It worked.
676	00:38:45	00:38:48	For a while.
677	00:38:48	00:38:51	I mean, you thought Lex killed her and...
678	00:38:51	00:38:52	ran off, right?
679	00:38:52	00:38:54	But then...
680	00:38:54	00:38:57	you found him.
681	00:38:57	00:39:01	Even in death, Lex makes me look like a chump.
682	00:39:03	00:39:05	You ever been in a band, man?
683	00:39:08	00:39:10	Thought you were good?
684	00:39:10	00:39:12	Lex was right.
685	00:39:12	00:39:15	The only time I was ever really alive was when we were together.
686	00:39:16	00:39:19	Playing.
687	00:39:19	00:39:21	And I swear...
688	00:39:23	00:39:24	...we were really good.
689	00:39:24	00:39:32	Well, Arnold, unfortunately for you, the music has stopped.
690	00:39:46	00:39:49	Angela, I need to talk to you.
691	00:39:52	00:39:56	Your dad reached out, tried to make things right.
692	00:39:58	00:40:02	I feel bad about what happened to him.
693	00:40:02	00:40:11	So, as a favor to your father, or even as a favor to me, you got to stop the hustle.
694	00:40:11	00:40:13	You got to ease out of the street life.
695	00:40:13	00:40:17	And do it now while you're still young, because...
696	00:40:17	00:40:20	it doesn't end pretty.
697	00:40:20	00:40:23	You don't know me.
698	00:40:23	00:40:26	I do.
699	00:40:27	00:40:34	You know, I spent, um, a lot of my life being a cop rather than being a dad.
700	00:40:34	00:40:38	I made a mistake.
701	00:40:38	00:40:41	And I don't want you to make the same mistake.
702	00:40:41	00:40:52	So, if you get in a jam, you get in trouble, you need some help, or even if you just want to have a cup of coffee, you call me.
703	00:40:52	00:40:55	Thanks. Oh.
704	00:40:55	00:40:57	This is from your dad.
705	00:41:00	00:41:01	I listened to it.
706	00:41:01	00:41:04	It's a... it-it's a pretty good song.
