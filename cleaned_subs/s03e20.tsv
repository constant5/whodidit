0	00:00:02	00:00:08	Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for the Comedy Hall's very own Michael Borland.
1	00:00:09	00:00:12	Look, look, the Kennedys killed Marilyn Monroe.
2	00:00:12	00:00:17	I'm pretty sure the gunman in the grassy knoll was either Arthur Miller or Joe DiMaggio.
3	00:00:17	00:00:18	Bang my wife...?
4	00:00:21	00:00:24	Hey, if you'd have me, I'd ask you to marry me.
5	00:00:24	00:00:26	Hell, somebody's got to clean my apartment.
6	00:00:26	00:00:29	Hey, how many of you people know the theme to Gilligan's Island?
7	00:00:29	00:00:30	( applause ) All right.
8	00:00:30	00:00:32	Now, how many of you can recite the Bill of Rights?
9	00:00:32	00:00:33	That's-that's-that's...
10	00:00:34	00:00:36	Who cares? It's really not that important.
11	00:00:36	00:00:37	We don't use it anymore.
12	00:00:45	00:00:50	I hear a lot of folks saying, You know, if it wasn't for the US, the, uh, French would be speaking German.
13	00:00:53	00:00:57	Yeah, well, if it, if it wasn't for the French, you'd be speaking Cherokee.
14	00:01:00	00:01:02	Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt your brains?
15	00:01:02	00:01:03	That's my time, everybody.
16	00:01:04	00:01:07	if you don't know what you're doing, don't do it harder.
17	00:01:07	00:01:08	Good night, everybody!
18	00:01:09	00:01:11	Zip me up.
19	00:01:15	00:01:17	Anything else?
20	00:01:17	00:01:18	Yeah. Laugh.
21	00:01:18	00:01:23	It recently came out that Jesus could've had siblings.
22	00:01:23	00:01:25	Could you imagine growing up having Jesus in your family?
23	00:01:25	00:01:27	Why can't you be more like your brother?
24	00:01:27	00:01:29	What's up, dude?
25	00:01:29	00:01:31	Uh, 'cause he's the Messiah. He's the son of God.
26	00:01:31	00:01:32	Hi, Lis. All right.
27	00:01:32	00:01:34	When your brother's home, we always have wine.
28	00:01:34	00:01:36	Caught your act on the tube last night.
29	00:01:36	00:01:37	You knocked them out.
30	00:01:37	00:01:39	I had to turn up the volume, I was laughing so loud.
31	00:01:39	00:01:40	This art exhibit get any laughs?
32	00:01:40	00:01:42	Hey, come on, you're my only headliner, you know that.
33	00:01:42	00:01:45	Well, I'm Michael Borland, and that's my time...
34	00:01:47	00:01:49	and that's your silence.
35	00:01:49	00:01:52	All right, now, ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to the headliner this evening...
36	00:01:54	00:02:01	...a man I'm sure you know from his hit TV show, Dougie to the Max, Mr. Dougie Max!
37	00:02:03	00:02:04	Hey, man...
38	00:02:11	00:02:13	What's up, Vegas?
39	00:02:25	00:02:28	Hey, kid, it's a cruel world.
40	00:02:32	00:02:33	Ain't it great? Bam!
41	00:02:33	00:02:35	Welcome to The Tragedy Hall.
42	00:02:35	00:02:39	Hey, you hear the one about the comedian who died onstage?
43	00:02:39	00:02:40	Literally. Bud-um-bum.
44	00:02:40	00:02:41	I'll be here all week.
45	00:02:42	00:02:44	Maybe he slipped on a banana peel.
46	00:02:44	00:02:46	Bud-um-bum. Hmm.
47	00:02:46	00:02:48	Crowd thought it was part of his act...
48	00:02:49	00:02:50	till he didn't get up.
49	00:02:50	00:02:51	Hi, David.
50	00:02:51	00:02:53	Hey, Catherine.
51	00:02:56	00:02:58	Well, there's no foam on the mouth.
52	00:02:58	00:03:01	No discoloration around the lips.
53	00:03:01	00:03:03	Pupils aren't dilated.
54	00:03:03	00:03:06	No overt evidence of a drug overdose.
55	00:03:06	00:03:09	When was the last time a comedian died of natural causes?
56	00:03:09	00:03:10	Clenched fist...
57	00:03:10	00:03:12	classic Levine sign.
58	00:03:12	00:03:14	He's awfully young for a heart attack.
59	00:03:14	00:03:15	Well, live fast, die young...
60	00:03:16	00:03:17	I forget the rest. Excuse me!
61	00:03:18	00:03:21	Could someone turn down the house lights, and turn up the stage lights?
62	00:03:21	00:03:23	Thank you.
63	00:03:23	00:03:27	I want to see what he saw... right before he died.
64	00:03:29	00:03:31	What do you see?
65	00:03:31	00:03:33	Nothing.
66	00:03:33	00:03:34	What are you looking for?
67	00:03:34	00:03:36	A punchline?
68	00:03:36	00:03:38	Bah-dum-bum.
69	00:04:16	00:04:18	See, here's a switch.
70	00:04:18	00:04:20	They've got him rolling in the aisles.
71	00:04:20	00:04:23	Well, I guess he's off to a better place.
72	00:04:23	00:04:24	Any place would be better than this dump.
73	00:04:24	00:04:24	Hey, hey!
74	00:04:25	00:04:26	Sorry, Alan. I didn't see you.
75	00:04:26	00:04:30	At least Dougie put laughter in the air and asses in the seats and drinks on the tabs.
76	00:04:31	00:04:33	I loved that guy.
77	00:04:33	00:04:37	Took me 15 years to find the next Kinison, and the minute I do, he gets a sitcom.
78	00:04:37	00:04:41	Now I have to pay him a king's ransom to come back here once a year, and this is where he started.
79	00:04:41	00:04:42	Figures the bastard would die on me.
80	00:04:43	00:04:49	You know, I-I should put up a sign, you know, like in Dealey Plaza, Kennedy Shot Here, Dougie Dropped Here.
81	00:04:49	00:04:50	Hey, Alan, you got a spot open now.
82	00:04:51	00:04:53	What do you say tomorrow you give me some time?
83	00:04:53	00:04:54	You got a job. You want to keep it?
84	00:04:56	00:05:00	Dougie was a hack with hack material who caught a break and never let anybody forget it.
85	00:05:00	00:05:02	Oh, you want suspects?
86	00:05:02	00:05:04	Here, check out the wall.
87	00:05:04	00:05:07	Any one of these guys'd kill to have his stage.
88	00:05:58	00:06:01	Oh, China.
89	00:06:01	00:06:03	Six bottles of Innoko water.
90	00:06:03	00:06:06	Three partially filled, three unopened.
91	00:06:06	00:06:08	Don't go Cousteau on me here.
92	00:06:08	00:06:09	It was all part of his shtick.
93	00:06:10	00:06:12	He was like Tarkanian with the towel.
94	00:06:12	00:06:14	You know, always biting and pacing.
95	00:06:14	00:06:18	Dougie's mantra was, It's a cruel world. Ain't it great?
96	00:06:19	00:06:22	Uh, it was low-brow. Strictly chug-and-belch.
97	00:06:22	00:06:30	Laughter is an involuntary motor response food, sex, body functions... death.
98	00:06:30	00:06:33	Yeah, it's a cruel world.
99	00:06:33	00:06:35	So, who has access to the Green Room?
100	00:06:35	00:06:36	Well, according to who?
101	00:06:36	00:06:38	According to me, just the talent.
102	00:06:38	00:06:40	According to these meat sticks-- the world.
103	00:06:41	00:06:42	All right.
104	00:06:42	00:06:45	I would like to see everyone's wallet.
105	00:06:45	00:06:47	I don't need to see your identification.
106	00:06:47	00:06:49	Just open your wallets.
107	00:06:49	00:06:53	Uh, it says I'm 180 pounds, but I'm 145.
108	00:06:53	00:06:59	I know that, in Nevada law, if there's a 25-pound discrepancy, that...
109	00:06:59	00:07:00	that's actually against the law. Thank you.
110	00:07:04	00:07:06	Thanks. Thank you.
111	00:07:06	00:07:10	In this one I'm wearing a thong.
112	00:07:10	00:07:14	That's more than I needed to know. Thank you.
113	00:07:27	00:07:30	When was the last time you used this credit card?
114	00:07:31	00:07:33	What?
115	00:07:58	00:08:00	C.O.D.?
116	00:08:00	00:08:02	Myocardial necrosis.
117	00:08:02	00:08:08	Just what you'd expect from a heart attack, only I didn't find any blockages consistent with coronary disease.
118	00:08:08	00:08:11	He was remarkably healthy for a dead guy.
119	00:08:11	00:08:13	Well, Dougie Max had more than comedy in his blood.
120	00:08:14	00:08:15	Tox came back positive for coke.
121	00:08:15	00:08:20	The answer is... the three main ways to take cocaine.
122	00:08:22	00:08:27	All right, Alex. What is snorting it, smoking it, or injecting it?
123	00:08:27	00:08:28	Very good.
124	00:08:28	00:08:35	The answer is normal nasal passages, clear lungs, and no track marks on the body.
125	00:08:35	00:08:39	Continuing this childish metaphor, what is how did the drugs get into his system?
126	00:08:39	00:08:41	We'll have to wait for Final Jeopardy.
127	00:08:45	00:08:49	My client has agreed to plead to possession and answer any questions.
128	00:08:49	00:08:51	Nothing she tells you can be interpreted as criminal intent...
129	00:08:51	00:08:53	Well, that's between you and the DA.
130	00:08:53	00:08:58	The preliminary tox screen on Dougie Max came back positive for cocaine.
131	00:08:58	00:09:00	Dougie was in a program, okay?
132	00:09:00	00:09:03	It was my cocaine. He wasn't using.
133	00:09:03	00:09:05	It was in his blood.
134	00:09:05	00:09:08	Well...
135	00:09:08	00:09:11	Dougie always liked to do a little hum-and-coke before a show.
136	00:09:21	00:09:28	Cocaine on the foreskin, or any skin, for that matter, is not a stimulant; it's a numbing agent.
137	00:09:28	00:09:30	Right. That was the idea.
138	00:09:30	00:09:34	You see, the goal wasn't to pop the cork.
139	00:09:34	00:09:37	It was to... shake the bottle.
140	00:09:37	00:09:38	Sounds frustrating.
141	00:09:38	00:09:41	Dougie liked to go out on stage frustrated.
142	00:09:41	00:09:44	I ran away from home at age 25.
143	00:09:44	00:09:47	I drank... and I whored... ( cheering )
144	00:09:47	00:09:48	...and I got my own show!
145	00:09:49	00:09:52	Yeah, Dougie to the Max, bee-yatch!
146	00:09:52	00:09:55	Gave him an edge.
147	00:09:55	00:09:58	go in hot...
148	00:09:58	00:10:00	burn the place down.
149	00:10:03	00:10:05	Oh, you're making coffee. Good. I could use some.
150	00:10:06	00:10:07	How do you take it?
151	00:10:07	00:10:09	Today, high-octane black.
152	00:10:09	00:10:12	I need your help with something.
153	00:10:12	00:10:15	Shoot.
154	00:10:17	00:10:21	A few weeks ago, Homicide gets called to Green Valley.
155	00:10:21	00:10:24	A woman in her 40s slips in the bathtub and drowns.
156	00:10:24	00:10:28	You know, cracked skull, raccooned eyes-- I mean, a traumatic death, but nothing suspicious.
157	00:10:28	00:10:30	CSI found what?
158	00:10:30	00:10:32	I didn't call them in. I ruled it an accident.
159	00:10:33	00:10:34	What changed?
160	00:10:34	00:10:38	Last night I saw the husband out on the town.
161	00:10:38	00:10:39	I mean, I could tell you something, Nick.
162	00:10:39	00:10:41	Three weeks ago, this guy was devastated.
163	00:10:41	00:10:44	I should've been here.
164	00:10:44	00:10:46	What am I going to do?
165	00:10:46	00:10:49	I mean, she was my life.
166	00:10:49	00:10:51	Onward and upward.
167	00:10:51	00:10:52	No, but this is way upward.
168	00:10:52	00:10:55	I mean, trades in his beat-up old Acura for a brand-new Ferrari.
169	00:10:56	00:10:59	He's with a girl who gives more lift-off than-than Cape Canaveral.
170	00:10:59	00:11:01	People grieve in different ways, man.
171	00:11:01	00:11:03	No, I understand that.
172	00:11:03	00:11:04	I got no problem with that. I'm not a priest.
173	00:11:04	00:11:06	That's why I called the life insurance carrier.
174	00:11:07	00:11:08	And check this out.
175	00:11:08	00:11:10	The morning... Shelley Stark...
176	00:11:10	00:11:14	was found, George Stark made a call to the life insurance agent.
177	00:11:15	00:11:18	My wife is dead. I want my money.
178	00:11:18	00:11:21	I mean, just like that. All in one breath.
179	00:11:21	00:11:22	What's the payout?
180	00:11:23	00:11:24	$750,000.
181	00:11:24	00:11:29	Now, I got the police report, autopsy protocol, detective summary, and scene photos.
182	00:11:33	00:11:34	You sure you're not looking for Grissom?
183	00:11:34	00:11:40	I'm chasing something that Gil Grissom isn't interested in-- a hunch.
184	00:11:40	00:11:42	I don't have to run any tests.
185	00:11:42	00:11:46	You cannot absorb enough cocaine through your penis to OD.
186	00:11:46	00:11:47	Cite your source.
187	00:11:47	00:11:48	I don't have a source.
188	00:11:48	00:11:50	That's why we did the tests.
189	00:11:50	00:11:51	Whatever.
190	00:11:51	00:11:53	All right, who wants it?
191	00:11:56	00:12:01	Cocaine levels are less than .05 milligrams per liter.
192	00:12:01	00:12:03	Way too low. That's not what killed him.
193	00:12:03	00:12:04	So what did?
194	00:12:04	00:12:07	Well, according to your blood sample, naratriptamine.
195	00:12:07	00:12:08	The new migraine medication?
196	00:12:08	00:12:10	Mm-hmm. Powerful stuff.
197	00:12:10	00:12:12	And what were the levels in the vic?
198	00:12:12	00:12:15	30 milligrams-- 12 times the recommended dosage.
199	00:12:15	00:12:19	Ooh. Dougie Max was poisoned.
200	00:12:19	00:12:20	To the max.
201	00:12:30	00:12:32	Cop shots. No rulers, no markers.
202	00:12:32	00:12:35	Just a bathroom, a towel bar, and a dead woman.
203	00:12:38	00:12:41	Injuries are consistent with an accident.
204	00:12:41	00:12:45	Yeah, but the contusion to the back of the head was not fatal.
205	00:12:55	00:12:57	Abbreviated autopsy.
206	00:12:57	00:12:59	Dr. Robbins oversaw.
207	00:12:59	00:13:01	drowning.
208	00:13:01	00:13:03	It jibes with the husband's account.
209	00:13:03	00:13:04	It jibes with the detective's account.
210	00:13:05	00:13:08	There is nothing in this file that suggests anything other than an accident.
211	00:13:08	00:13:09	I don't know, Sara...
212	00:13:09	00:13:13	other people's notes, other people's photos, evidence twice-removed.
213	00:13:13	00:13:15	No CSI ever even got to look at it.
214	00:13:18	00:13:20	Do you want to go to the bathroom?
215	00:13:22	00:13:26	Consumables from the club that matched Dougie's stomach contents.
216	00:13:26	00:13:32	We know that he had naratriptamine in his system, and we also know that the poison was ingested.
217	00:13:32	00:13:36	Because Spam can't be absorbed through the penis, and if you ask me to cite my source...
218	00:13:36	00:13:38	I'll take your word for it.
219	00:13:59	00:14:00	Death by chocolate again?
220	00:14:02	00:14:04	Hmm.
221	00:14:15	00:14:19	Miss, plea-please-please don't get so close to the car, all right?
222	00:14:19	00:14:21	The alarm is really delicate.
223	00:14:21	00:14:24	We're not really as concerned with the car, sir.
224	00:14:24	00:14:26	What we'd like to do is look at your bathroom.
225	00:14:26	00:14:30	Um, why, wha-what would you like to look at the bathroom for?
226	00:14:31	00:14:32	Like I said, we're with the Crime Lab.
227	00:14:32	00:14:35	We're here to tie up some loose ends regarding your wife's case.
228	00:14:35	00:14:41	I appreciate how thorough you guys are being, but... I got... I got to be honest.
229	00:14:42	00:14:43	This is pretty painful territory for me. Right.
230	00:14:43	00:14:47	I mean, it's still pretty hard to get up in the morning without Shelley. I understand...
231	00:14:48	00:14:50	Ma'am, miss, I thought I...
232	00:14:50	00:14:53	Sorry. I-I-I-I'm sorry. I, uh...
233	00:14:55	00:14:57	Your neighbors are looking.
234	00:14:57	00:15:01	I'll get the keys. Come on. Come on in.
235	00:15:05	00:15:07	It smells like fresh paint.
236	00:15:07	00:15:10	Yeah, I had the whole place redone this week.
237	00:15:10	00:15:12	Bad memories.
238	00:15:12	00:15:14	Did you replace the tub?
239	00:15:14	00:15:15	No.
240	00:15:15	00:15:16	But you replaced the fixtures.
241	00:15:18	00:15:20	There used to be a towel bar there.
242	00:15:20	00:15:21	Yeah.
243	00:15:21	00:15:24	Would you by any chance have the old towel bar lying around somewhere?
244	00:15:24	00:15:27	No, the contractor tossed it. It was junk.
245	00:15:27	00:15:28	Came with the house.
246	00:15:28	00:15:30	This whole subdivision comes stock.
247	00:15:30	00:15:36	In fact, the first thing the broker told me when I bought it-- if I ever want to sell, invest in upgrades. You selling?
248	00:15:36	00:15:38	Too big for one person.
249	00:15:40	00:15:41	Thank you.
250	00:15:41	00:15:45	Uh, thanks for your time.
251	00:15:45	00:15:46	Mmm.
252	00:15:48	00:15:50	You pulled the plug kind of early.
253	00:15:50	00:15:51	What's going on?
254	00:15:51	00:15:53	Yeah, that bathroom's not the crime scene anymore.
255	00:15:54	00:15:56	I say we go with the next best thing.
256	00:15:57	00:15:59	Model home.
257	00:15:59	00:16:01	Model home.
258	00:16:01	00:16:05	What do Socrates, Edgar Allen Poe, and Dougie Max have in common?
259	00:16:05	00:16:07	They all drank themselves to death.
260	00:16:07	00:16:09	You've isolated the source of the poison?
261	00:16:09	00:16:14	Naratriptamine-- Innoko water bottle number three.
262	00:16:19	00:16:21	Oh, God.
263	00:16:23	00:16:25	What about the other bottles?
264	00:16:25	00:16:26	Clean.
265	00:16:26	00:16:30	Okay. I need you to process that bottle for trace impurities.
266	00:16:30	00:16:35	Got it. Anything that might've mixed in with the poison could help us identify the original source.
267	00:16:35	00:16:37	We identify the source...
268	00:16:37	00:16:39	maybe we identify the killer.
269	00:16:40	00:16:42	Where are you going?
270	00:16:42	00:16:43	To get a drink.
271	00:16:50	00:16:52	75 units with 75 identical floor plans.
272	00:16:52	00:16:56	I never thought I'd be grateful for cookie cutter homes.
273	00:16:56	00:16:58	Like bees in a hive. Gives me the creeps.
274	00:16:58	00:16:59	You sure you don't want me to do this?
275	00:16:59	00:17:01	Are you kidding? I live for this.
276	00:17:01	00:17:03	And Shelley Stark and I are the same height and weight.
277	00:17:03	00:17:06	Yeah, but you're taller, thinner.
278	00:17:06	00:17:09	Oh, butter that toast, Nick.
279	00:17:14	00:17:16	Okay, I'm Shelley Stark.
280	00:17:16	00:17:21	My bath is over, and I'm about to get out, so...
281	00:17:21	00:17:29	I brace myself with my left hand, and I'm getting up at a 45-degree angle, and I slip... so, I grab the first thing that I can.
282	00:17:30	00:17:30	Towel bar.
283	00:17:31	00:17:32	Towel bar.
284	00:17:33	00:17:34	Okay.
285	00:17:34	00:17:39	So, at this point, all of my weight is being supported by this bar.
286	00:17:39	00:17:41	And it doesn't budge.
287	00:17:41	00:17:42	No.
288	00:17:46	00:17:48	You okay?
289	00:17:48	00:17:50	Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine...
290	00:17:50	00:17:52	but this thing is coming down.
291	00:17:53	00:17:54	Okay.
292	00:17:56	00:17:58	You sure you don't want me to do that?
293	00:17:58	00:17:59	No.
294	00:18:00	00:18:01	Okay.
295	00:18:04	00:18:06	Sara.
296	00:18:10	00:18:13	There is no way that Shelley Stark brought down this towel bar.
297	00:18:13	00:18:15	You want me to give it a shot?
298	00:18:39	00:18:41	Someone took a lot of effort to make this look like an accident.
299	00:18:41	00:18:44	Yeah, about $750,000 worth of effort.
300	00:18:44	00:18:47	Okay, so you know the thing that drives me crazy about men?
301	00:18:47	00:18:51	You know how they take the toilet paper, and then they put it up on top of the holder.
302	00:18:51	00:18:52	What is that?
303	00:18:52	00:18:55	Do they not see that?
304	00:18:55	00:18:57	Are they just busy looking at their underwear on the floor?
305	00:18:57	00:19:00	I got a nickname for my man.
306	00:19:00	00:19:05	I call him Mr. Drop-and-Stay, 'cause if he drops it, man, it just stays there.
307	00:19:05	00:19:09	God, uh, ooh, well, and that's my time.
308	00:19:09	00:19:16	Uh, you've been 14 quiet people, six empty tables, and I'll see you in hell.
309	00:19:16	00:19:19	Modern version of the old hook.
310	00:19:21	00:19:23	Welcome to Open Mike Night, guys. What can I get you?
311	00:19:23	00:19:25	Information.
312	00:19:25	00:19:28	Wow, your coffee stinks.
313	00:19:28	00:19:34	Oh, really. I'm sorry it's not up to the standards of your crap-ass home brew, but that'll be five bucks all the same, my friend.
314	00:19:34	00:19:39	Dougie Max's Innoko water bottles that were on the stage his last performance-- who set them up?
315	00:19:39	00:19:40	Yours truly. Bartender.
316	00:19:40	00:19:42	Mr. Max had very acquired tastes.
317	00:19:42	00:19:45	Lofty demands, you know.
318	00:19:45	00:19:48	Six pristine Innoko water bottles, labels all facing the Luxor.
319	00:19:48	00:19:50	And a Green Room?
320	00:19:50	00:19:54	Forget it. Silver tray, Spam, Choco Bees-- all blue.
321	00:19:54	00:19:57	Not-not to mention that, uh, passionfruit stuff-- what is it, two bucks a pop?
322	00:19:57	00:19:58	Try to find that stuff.
323	00:19:58	00:20:00	Let's get back to the water.
324	00:20:00	00:20:02	It was poisoned.
325	00:20:04	00:20:05	Really?
326	00:20:05	00:20:06	Mmm.
327	00:20:06	00:20:10	The, uh, bottles you took out to the stage-- where'd they come from?
328	00:20:10	00:20:12	That... Dougie's private stash.
329	00:20:12	00:20:16	Well, besides you and Dougie, who had access to it?
330	00:20:16	00:20:19	Nobody's allowed behind the bar besides the bar staff and me.
331	00:20:19	00:20:22	But no one listens to him. You got a bottle opener?
332	00:20:22	00:20:24	Hey, that's going on your tab, you leech.
333	00:20:24	00:20:25	I'm scared.
334	00:20:25	00:20:26	Well, you've got a temper...
335	00:20:26	00:20:28	and a record.
336	00:20:28	00:20:30	Assault. Club in Tucson.
337	00:20:30	00:20:34	Yeah, I had a temper, until I kicked the crap out of a heckler for interrupting my closing bit.
338	00:20:34	00:20:35	Do you get headaches?
339	00:20:36	00:20:37	I'm getting one right now.
340	00:20:37	00:20:39	We want all the Innoko water...
341	00:20:40	00:20:42	to go.
342	00:20:48	00:20:49	Warrick...
343	00:20:49	00:20:51	this just in.
344	00:20:51	00:20:53	D.B. at a convenience store on Torrey Pines.
345	00:20:53	00:20:54	You're all I got.
346	00:20:54	00:20:56	I'm on it.
347	00:20:56	00:20:57	Oh, hey, listen.
348	00:20:57	00:20:59	I checked the bartender's medical records.
349	00:20:59	00:21:02	The guy's had six different prescriptions for migraines in the last two years.
350	00:21:03	00:21:04	Guess which one he's on now?
351	00:21:04	00:21:05	Naratriptamine.
352	00:21:20	00:21:21	I'm Warrick Brown from CSI.
353	00:21:21	00:21:23	You want to tell me what happened here?
354	00:21:23	00:21:25	I don't know.
355	00:21:25	00:21:27	Kid walks in. He goes down an aisle.
356	00:21:27	00:21:29	Next thing I know, he drops dead.
357	00:21:32	00:21:33	Where'd he start?
358	00:21:33	00:21:36	He was pacing back and forth, scoping the place out.
359	00:21:36	00:21:38	I always spot those kids.
360	00:21:38	00:21:39	People don't know.
361	00:21:39	00:21:44	You consume food or drink in the store, it's the same as shoplifting until you pay for it.
362	00:21:44	00:21:45	What'd he steal?
363	00:21:45	00:21:46	A beverage.
364	00:21:46	00:21:48	He put it back before I could catch him.
365	00:21:48	00:21:50	Where?
366	00:21:50	00:21:51	Over here.
367	00:22:10	00:22:11	This isn't funny anymore.
368	00:22:14	00:22:19	We pulled 140 bottles of Innoko water off the shelves in this store alone.
369	00:22:19	00:22:21	There's 500 convenience stores in Vegas.
370	00:22:21	00:22:23	We need to get this product off the shelves now.
371	00:22:23	00:22:25	Grocery stores, restaurants, wholesalers...
372	00:22:25	00:22:28	Right now, it looks like only your Innoko water product is involved.
373	00:22:28	00:22:36	CSI is going to need the name of any recent firings, anyone with a lawsuit against the company, anyone who's made threats against the company-- anyone with an axe to grind.
374	00:22:36	00:22:41	I know that we risk panic, Chief, but I'd rather risk that than have another victim.
375	00:22:41	00:22:43	Hang on.
376	00:22:43	00:22:45	We need to find out what's in there.
377	00:22:45	00:22:47	I'm back.
378	00:22:47	00:22:48	Yeah.
379	00:22:48	00:22:49	Right.
380	00:22:50	00:22:52	I checked her lungs-- bath water.
381	00:22:52	00:22:55	And the blow to the back of the head consistent with a fall.
382	00:22:55	00:23:03	Besides, Homicide reported that nothing at the scene indicated foul play, so, there was no reason to do more than an abbreviated autopsy.
383	00:23:03	00:23:05	No one's impugning your work, Doctor.
384	00:23:05	00:23:06	Yeah, it's nothing personal, Doc.
385	00:23:06	00:23:08	Well, this is personal, Nick.
386	00:23:08	00:23:21	I tend to take my work to heart, and when the two of you come in here asking me to sign a court-ordered request for an exhumation of a body that's already left my hands, I tend to take it very personally.
387	00:23:21	00:23:27	Look, I'm the one who said Shelley Stark's death was an accident, and I'm the one with second thoughts.
388	00:23:27	00:23:29	I mean, it's my ass on the line.
389	00:23:29	00:23:31	That's wrong, Captain. It's my ass on the line.
390	00:23:31	00:23:35	I don't think the two of you are sensitive to what we're really talking about here.
391	00:23:35	00:23:38	First of all, exhumations are costly and public.
392	00:23:38	00:23:40	Makes this office look inept, and that's just internally.
393	00:23:41	00:23:42	God forbid it gets in the newspaper.
394	00:23:42	00:23:47	Remember something-- the public does not understand abbreviated autopsy.
395	00:23:47	00:23:50	All they hear is Oh, what did he miss?
396	00:23:50	00:23:51	No one's saying you missed anything.
397	00:23:51	00:23:52	We have new evidence.
398	00:23:52	00:23:54	We need to reevaluate the body.
399	00:23:54	00:23:56	Respectfully, Nick, I don't think you understand.
400	00:23:56	00:23:58	I think I do understand.
401	00:23:58	00:24:00	Yeah, Nick...
402	00:24:00	00:24:01	Give us a minute, will you?
403	00:24:02	00:24:03	Just a minute.
404	00:24:05	00:24:10	Neither of us want to be wrong, but this isn't about the press, the public, your office, you or me.
405	00:24:10	00:24:12	This is about Shelley Stark.
406	00:24:12	00:24:13	Now, we can do one of two things.
407	00:24:13	00:24:19	We can do nothing, let this guy walk, or we can go to work, exhume the body, and find new evidence.
408	00:24:19	00:24:21	Now, it's your call.
409	00:25:10	00:25:13	The poison in both bottles is naratriptamine.
410	00:25:13	00:25:18	Same trace impurities in the water-- sulfides, phenols, amino acid complexes and caffeine.
411	00:25:18	00:25:25	So, we've got two bottles of poisoned Innoko water-- one from a comedy club on Western, the other from a convenience store halfway across town.
412	00:25:25	00:25:26	What's the connection?
413	00:25:26	00:25:28	There may not be one; it could just be random.
414	00:25:28	00:25:30	So, how are we going to get this guy?
415	00:25:30	00:25:34	You know, they never caught the guy who put the cyanide in the Tylenol back in the '80s.
416	00:25:34	00:25:36	They found out how the bottles were tampered with.
417	00:25:36	00:25:38	That's where safety seals came from.
418	00:26:00	00:26:05	No injection holes in the bottle from the Speedy Mart.
419	00:26:05	00:26:07	Do you see anything?
420	00:26:07	00:26:09	No, nothing yet.
421	00:26:12	00:26:15	Wait a minute.
422	00:26:15	00:26:17	It's in the threads.
423	00:26:23	00:26:26	Would you like to try one from the Comedy Hole?
424	00:26:26	00:26:30	Mr. Phillips, she's not going to hop out of that coffin by herself.
425	00:26:30	00:26:33	Doc, I'm not quite sure how to proceed.
426	00:26:33	00:26:34	First exhumation.
427	00:26:35	00:26:36	Well, it's very simple.
428	00:26:37	00:26:38	You open it up.
429	00:26:38	00:26:43	Now, if she grabs you, use your free hand and hold her down, okay?
430	00:26:43	00:26:46	Okay.
431	00:26:52	00:26:53	Wow.
432	00:26:53	00:26:55	She's pretty well-preserved.
433	00:26:55	00:26:57	Well, embalming does...
434	00:26:57	00:27:02	Removes the blood, retards bacterial growth, and, uh, pickles the tissue.
435	00:27:02	00:27:04	David, would you go to the store and buy some cold cream?
436	00:27:04	00:27:07	Why? Her makeup-- it's got to come off.
437	00:27:07	00:27:09	Oh. Okay.
438	00:27:09	00:27:11	Thanks.
439	00:27:11	00:27:13	Thanks, Dave.
440	00:27:13	00:27:20	Las Vegas awakens today with a terrible realization that our city may face a new and deadly menace.
441	00:27:20	00:27:29	15-year-old Casey Flynn collapsed and died this morning shortly after drinking a bottle of Innoko water at a convenience store near Torrey Pines.
442	00:27:29	00:27:31	What kind of sick bastard would do something like this?
443	00:27:31	00:27:34	The question isn't who-- it's how.
444	00:27:34	00:27:40	As in how do they expect this lab to test 40,000 bottles of overpriced tap water?
445	00:27:40	00:27:44	If we have to, one bottle at a time until we find every tainted bottle.
446	00:27:44	00:27:52	The events occurred on opposite ends of town, and investigators have not yet established a definite connection between the two deaths.
447	00:27:52	00:27:59	But Las Vegas residents fear the worst-- that our city may be in the grip of a product-tampering nightmare.
448	00:27:59	00:28:02	You know how they tested for the cyanide in the Tylenol case?
449	00:28:02	00:28:04	Hodges? One, two, three?
450	00:28:05	00:28:07	They took it to the airport.
451	00:28:07	00:28:10	They x-rayed bottles in bulk using baggage scanners.
452	00:28:10	00:28:13	Nice-- cyanide's opaque to X rays.
453	00:28:13	00:28:16	Yeah, cyanide and X rays-- that's a lucky break.
454	00:28:16	00:28:20	But any of you geniuses have a lucky test for naratriptamine?
455	00:28:20	00:28:23	We've got a bigger problem than we thought we had.
456	00:28:23	00:28:24	Why are you looking at me?
457	00:28:24	00:28:26	I'm not looking at you.
458	00:28:26	00:28:27	Yes, you are.
459	00:28:28	00:28:31	We think that we nailed the tampering method.
460	00:28:31	00:28:32	The poison wasn't inside the bottle.
461	00:28:32	00:28:34	It was on the bottle cap.
462	00:28:34	00:28:39	We think that the killer dripped a solution of naratriptamine into the threads of the bottle cap.
463	00:28:39	00:28:44	Capillary action pulled the solution into the threads, where it dried into white crystals.
464	00:28:44	00:28:50	Oh, so, each time Dougie Max and Casey Flynn took a sip, the liquid came in contact with the threads and washed back into the bottle.
465	00:28:52	00:28:55	And so the poison I found in the Innoko water was... backwash.
466	00:28:55	00:29:00	Which means that we're going to have to take the caps off of 40,000 bottles.
467	00:29:00	00:29:01	Right now, that's the way it looks.
468	00:29:01	00:29:03	Great.
469	00:29:33	00:29:36	I need to see the lot numbers of the bottles you pulled from the convenience store.
470	00:29:36	00:29:44	I got all the stacks arranged by locations, so the convenience store is right here.
471	00:29:44	00:29:48	140 bottles-- NV6630.
472	00:29:51	00:29:53	The tainted bottles didn't come from this lot.
473	00:29:53	00:29:56	Well, the bottle that killed Casey Flynn came from this store.
474	00:29:56	00:29:59	Somebody may have just walked in and put it there, though.
475	00:29:59	00:30:02	Where are the bottles from the comedy club?
476	00:30:02	00:30:04	Over here.
477	00:30:09	00:30:10	These are a match.
478	00:30:10	00:30:14	So, the source of the poison bottles was the comedy club.
479	00:30:14	00:30:19	Maybe the killer wanted us to think it was random product tampering.
480	00:30:19	00:30:21	Why?
481	00:30:21	00:30:23	To cover up one murder with another.
482	00:30:29	00:30:31	I've never seen mold like this.
483	00:30:31	00:30:40	Embalming fluid's a witch's brew of formaldehyde, phenol, menthol and alcohol, perfume and pink coloring agent.
484	00:30:40	00:30:42	Kills the bacteria, but mold feeds on it?
485	00:30:43	00:30:43	Yeah.
486	00:30:44	00:30:47	It's like bathing an infant, Nick.
487	00:30:47	00:30:49	Soft and always in motion.
488	00:30:54	00:30:56	What's wrong? I'm not doing it right?
489	00:30:56	00:30:57	No, you're doing fine.
490	00:30:57	00:31:01	See the bruising on her back and her right elbow?
491	00:31:01	00:31:04	It's consistent with her fall.
492	00:31:04	00:31:06	But it wasn't in your report.
493	00:31:06	00:31:09	Well, it wasn't evident four weeks ago.
494	00:31:09	00:31:17	Subtle bruising may not be evident at the time of death, but it can be accentuated by the embalming process after the body leaves my slab.
495	00:31:17	00:31:21	This bruising would have meant nothing to the mortician.
496	00:31:21	00:31:24	They're in the beauty business.
497	00:31:24	00:31:26	It's my job to spot them, his job to cover them.
498	00:31:26	00:31:28	Let's turn her over.
499	00:31:28	00:31:29	Got her?
500	00:31:29	00:31:30	Yeah.
501	00:31:30	00:31:31	Here we go.
502	00:31:36	00:31:39	All right, let's see what's under that makeup.
503	00:31:48	00:31:51	Bruises on her face.
504	00:31:53	00:31:55	Brass was right.
505	00:31:55	00:31:58	We are looking at murder.
506	00:31:58	00:32:00	Naratriptamine comes in tablet form.
507	00:32:00	00:32:02	In order to get it in the solution, you'd have to grind it up.
508	00:32:02	00:32:05	There were traces of caffeine with the naratriptamine.
509	00:32:05	00:32:07	Right, so how did it get there?
510	00:32:07	00:32:09	Maybe it got there during the grinding process.
511	00:32:09	00:32:13	There was a coffee grinder in the Green Room at the Comedy Hole.
512	00:32:16	00:32:20	Do you provide your comedians with coffee or do they brew their own?
513	00:32:20	00:32:21	Around here you get generic.
514	00:32:21	00:32:24	If they want something special, they can bring a thermos.
515	00:32:24	00:32:27	Just take whatever you want, okay?
516	00:32:27	00:32:29	Knock yourself out.
517	00:32:48	00:32:54	That's the last picture taken of Dougie Max before he died.
518	00:32:59	00:33:02	Doesn't the red light mean get off the stage?
519	00:33:02	00:33:05	No, the red light means get off the stage now.
520	00:33:05	00:33:08	So why were you giving Dougie Max the red light?
521	00:33:08	00:33:09	He's my headliner.
522	00:33:09	00:33:11	I wasn't giving him the red light.
523	00:33:43	00:33:47	We're going to need a sample of everyone's DNA.
524	00:33:47	00:33:48	All right, gentleman.
525	00:33:48	00:33:49	Good afternoon.
526	00:33:49	00:33:51	Could you line up for me, please.
527	00:33:51	00:33:52	Right up here, please.
528	00:33:52	00:33:54	Is this going to take a long time?
529	00:33:54	00:33:57	00 bikini wax that I don't want to miss.
530	00:33:57	00:33:59	I got to get my wig redone like in a half hour, so if we...
531	00:33:59	00:34:00	I have plenty of time.
532	00:34:00	00:34:02	I have no career.
533	00:34:02	00:34:06	Right, well, I can see you all know how to open your mouths, so, good.
534	00:34:06	00:34:08	Ready?
535	00:34:10	00:34:12	Just give me an O.
536	00:34:12	00:34:14	I need a lot of foreplay.
537	00:34:15	00:34:17	Oh, well, then maybe I should use a rectal swab.
538	00:34:17	00:34:19	Ah... oh.
539	00:34:20	00:34:22	Good boy.
540	00:34:22	00:34:23	Okay, who's next for some foreplay?
541	00:34:24	00:34:26	Oh, a nail biter, huh?
542	00:34:26	00:34:28	You mind if I see your hands?
543	00:34:36	00:34:38	I'm one of 11 kids from 12 dads.
544	00:34:38	00:34:40	You figure it out.
545	00:34:40	00:34:41	Yeah, I gave him the red light.
546	00:34:41	00:34:45	What are you going to do, arrest me for distraction with intent to humiliate?
547	00:34:45	00:34:46	I'm guilty.
548	00:34:49	00:34:50	What? Are you kidding me?
549	00:34:50	00:34:52	I was joking.
550	00:34:52	00:34:54	Funny.
551	00:34:54	00:34:57	You know, something about your wife's case never felt right to me.
552	00:34:58	00:35:00	It bugged me, kept me up at night.
553	00:35:00	00:35:04	It's not because you called your insurance company and filed a claim the next day.
554	00:35:04	00:35:06	It's your policy; it's your right.
555	00:35:06	00:35:09	It's not because you bought a new Ferrari; it's your money.
556	00:35:09	00:35:11	Or because you're with a beautiful girl.
557	00:35:11	00:35:14	I mean, you just lost your wife, you need some companionship.
558	00:35:14	00:35:16	No.
559	00:35:16	00:35:20	Because of something you said.
560	00:35:20	00:35:22	What am I going to do?
561	00:35:22	00:35:25	She was my life.
562	00:35:25	00:35:29	You said, She was my life.
563	00:35:30	00:35:31	Not is.
564	00:35:31	00:35:32	That's why I'm sitting here?
565	00:35:33	00:35:36	Because I used the wrong tense at the time of my wife's death?
566	00:35:36	00:35:37	No, hold on a minute.
567	00:35:37	00:35:39	I've been a detective for half my life.
568	00:35:39	00:35:51	I can count on one hand the times surviving spouses used the past tense, and I got to tell you, I'll be damned if every one of them wasn't guilty of something.
569	00:35:53	00:35:55	Now, I mean, that's just me.
570	00:35:55	00:35:58	I mean, in a court of law it means nothing.
571	00:35:58	00:35:59	But...
572	00:36:00	00:36:02	this...
573	00:36:02	00:36:04	and this...
574	00:36:05	00:36:07	and this...
575	00:36:07	00:36:08	mean everything.
576	00:36:08	00:36:11	The fact that you're left-handed doesn't hurt us either.
577	00:36:11	00:36:13	Hurts you, though.
578	00:36:13	00:36:15	Wait a minute.
579	00:36:15	00:36:16	I haven't seen these.
580	00:36:16	00:36:18	New evidence.
581	00:36:18	00:36:20	Body was exhumed by a court order.
582	00:36:20	00:36:23	Second autopsy.
583	00:36:23	00:36:24	You dug her up?
584	00:36:24	00:36:25	Mm-hmm.
585	00:36:25	00:36:28	I didn't give anyone permission to dig her up.
586	00:36:28	00:36:30	You're a suspect in a murder case.
587	00:36:30	00:36:31	We don't need your permission.
588	00:36:31	00:36:32	Can they do that?
589	00:36:34	00:36:35	Yeah.
590	00:36:35	00:36:38	You killed your wife, George.
591	00:36:38	00:36:41	I loved my wife.
592	00:36:41	00:36:43	And she loved you.
593	00:36:43	00:36:49	Which is why she didn't react when you walked into the bathroom that night.
594	00:37:20	00:37:23	You staged the crime scene.
595	00:37:23	00:37:28	You see, it's physically impossible for her to pull that towel rack off the bathroom wall.
596	00:37:28	00:37:30	It was an accident.
597	00:37:30	00:37:32	You said so yourself.
598	00:37:32	00:37:35	I was wrong.
599	00:37:39	00:37:43	I see the pictures. I hear the theories.
600	00:37:43	00:37:46	Still doesn't make my client a murderer.
601	00:37:55	00:37:56	Hey!
602	00:37:56	00:37:58	Hey! Hey!
603	00:37:58	00:38:00	That's my car! What are you...?
604	00:38:03	00:38:04	What the hell is going on?
605	00:38:04	00:38:05	This is harassment.
606	00:38:05	00:38:11	We don't have enough to file charges, but the insurance company feels they got more than enough.
607	00:38:11	00:38:13	Civil charges.
608	00:38:13	00:38:15	that means they want their cheese back, man.
609	00:38:16	00:38:17	They want their $750K.
610	00:38:17	00:38:19	They can just take my car?
611	00:38:19	00:38:20	For starters, yeah.
612	00:38:20	00:38:24	This isn't the end of our criminal investigation there, George.
613	00:38:24	00:38:25	It's just the beginning.
614	00:38:25	00:38:28	That's present tense.
615	00:38:28	00:38:31	The coffee you bagged from the club doesn't match the tainted Innoko water.
616	00:38:32	00:38:33	That's the bad news.
617	00:38:33	00:38:35	Still listening.
618	00:38:35	00:38:38	You know what I have that you want in the mornings?
619	00:38:38	00:38:41	Apart from my devilish grin and rakish good looks, of course.
620	00:38:41	00:38:42	I like your coffee.
621	00:38:43	00:38:44	No, no.
622	00:38:44	00:38:45	You love my coffee.
623	00:38:45	00:38:46	And you want to know why?
624	00:38:46	00:38:47	It's Blue Hawaiian.
625	00:38:47	00:38:49	40 bucks a pound, hand-picked...
626	00:38:49	00:38:51	I know, the finest money can buy.
627	00:38:51	00:38:53	No, not even close.
628	00:38:53	00:38:54	Just let me get there.
629	00:38:54	00:38:56	Now caffeine by itself is not distinctive.
630	00:38:56	00:38:58	It's in all kinds of coffee by definition.
631	00:38:58	00:39:02	Now the trace amino acid complex, on the other hand, is a signature.
632	00:39:02	00:39:06	Okay, so you've identified the type of coffee.
633	00:39:07	00:39:09	Kopi Luwak.
634	00:39:09	00:39:11	The most expensive coffee in the world.
635	00:39:11	00:39:19	Revered for its rich, chocolatey texture and made from the excrement of a small Indonesian cat-like creature known as a luwak.
636	00:39:19	00:39:21	Cat feces?
637	00:39:21	00:39:26	The luwak eats only the ripest beans, which pass through its digestive system intact.
638	00:39:26	00:39:31	However, during the process enzymes break down a number of amino acids which cause bitterness.
639	00:39:31	00:39:33	And leaves a unique chemical signature.
640	00:39:33	00:39:38	So whichever one of your suspects drinks Kopi Luwak is your killer.
641	00:39:41	00:39:43	We are a bashing nation.
642	00:39:43	00:39:45	Gay bashing? You know what that is?
643	00:39:45	00:40:02	That's guys going, I hate you 'cause you're queer and you're gay and you're kind of attractive and I would like to have sex with you but I'm in the closet so I'll just beat you up and then play with myself in my Trans Am on the way home.
644	00:40:02	00:40:03	Boo.
645	00:40:03	00:40:04	Boo?
646	00:40:04	00:40:05	Oh, I'm sorry.
647	00:40:05	00:40:07	I didn't mean to offend you.
648	00:40:07	00:40:08	Hey, you know what?
649	00:40:08	00:40:12	If that offends you, perhaps you should just come out of the closet and move on with your life.
650	00:40:12	00:40:14	You're going to feel so much better.
651	00:40:14	00:40:15	You know, you are what you hate.
652	00:40:21	00:40:23	All right, um...
653	00:40:23	00:40:26	Mm, I'm a little dehydrated.
654	00:40:26	00:40:29	I hope you don't mind if I replenish my bodily fluids.
655	00:40:29	00:40:30	Mm...
656	00:40:41	00:40:41	It's a cruel world...
657	00:40:42	00:40:44	Ain't it great?
658	00:40:44	00:40:45	Yeah.
659	00:40:45	00:40:46	You know what you'd like?
660	00:40:46	00:40:53	How many people would like it if I just, if I just dropped trou right now and pee on Vin Diesel's head, huh?
661	00:40:55	00:40:57	I'm going to do it for you good people.
662	00:40:57	00:40:59	I'll do it.
663	00:41:05	00:41:07	Open wide.
664	00:41:07	00:41:09	I'm flattering myself, ladies and gentlemen.
665	00:41:09	00:41:11	You don't have to open up that wide.
666	00:41:11	00:41:14	See, I'm implying I have a tiny, tiny penis.
667	00:41:14	00:41:16	That's what that joke would be.
668	00:41:16	00:41:17	Ergo, the comedy.
669	00:41:17	00:41:20	I'm talking about penises.
670	00:41:21	00:41:23	You just want to eat out of that toilet bowl.
671	00:41:24	00:41:25	Yum, yum.
672	00:41:30	00:41:31	Shut up.
673	00:41:33	00:41:35	Shut up.
674	00:41:35	00:41:36	Don't you get it?
675	00:41:36	00:41:37	Are you that stupid?
676	00:41:37	00:41:39	I am making fun of you.
677	00:41:39	00:41:43	I am the lowest common denominator in comedy when I do that crap.
678	00:41:46	00:41:58	The only way I could get you to stop laughing now is if I went to every single table and slit every one of your throats.
679	00:42:02	00:42:09	I can see that I am getting the red light, ladies and gentlemen, and that means it's time for me to stop.
680	00:42:09	00:42:14	Stop with the hate and stop with the fear.
681	00:42:14	00:42:17	Stop with the lies.
682	00:42:17	00:42:23	Comedy, uh, comedy's supposed to be about the truth.
683	00:42:23	00:42:27	You know, uh, I killed tonight.
684	00:42:27	00:42:32	And, uh, I killed, uh, two nights ago.
685	00:42:32	00:42:34	Dougie Max.
686	00:42:34	00:42:37	Uh... on this stage.
687	00:42:39	00:42:44	'Cause I despised everything he stood for.
688	00:42:45	00:42:48	Dumb people, like you.
689	00:42:48	00:42:54	You think I did a disservice to the world by killing Dougie Max?
