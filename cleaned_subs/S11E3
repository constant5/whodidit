8,00:00:35,00:00:36,"No! Stop, please!"
9,00:00:36,00:00:38,Don't stop.
10,00:00:38,00:00:39,(metal blade scrapes)
11,00:00:39,00:00:40,(screams)
12,00:00:44,00:00:47,(indistinct police radio transmission)
13,00:00:47,00:00:48,Hey.
14,00:00:50,00:00:53,"You know that the speed limit is not a suggestion, right?"
15,00:00:53,00:00:55,"You gonna give me a ticket, copper?"
16,00:00:55,00:00:57,Used to bring Lindsey up here.
17,00:00:57,00:01:02,Mount Charleston always has been a hot spot for skiers and hikers and...
18,00:01:02,00:01:05,Now murderers.
19,00:01:21,00:01:23,You can see the terror in his eyes.
20,00:01:24,00:01:27,This man knew he was going to die.
21,00:01:31,00:01:33,This is a serious blood pool.
22,00:01:33,00:01:36,He was alive when his head was chopped off.
23,00:01:40,00:01:43,Still tacky.
24,00:01:43,00:01:45,Fresh kill.
25,00:01:45,00:01:52,"VARTANN: So the park ranger said he thought he heard wolves howling, but they're not native to the area, so he came down here to check it out."
26,00:01:52,00:01:56,WILLOWS: Looks like his body's been posed.
27,00:01:56,00:01:58,Could be some kind of a cult killing.
28,00:01:58,00:02:03,"Satanic rituals are often performed in a natural setting like this, but this..."
29,00:02:03,00:02:05,fence is a poor altar.
30,00:02:05,00:02:07,"If this was a ritualistic killing, there would be some..."
31,00:02:07,00:02:09,sign.
32,00:02:11,00:02:12,Blood moon.
33,00:02:13,00:02:19,"In the Book of Revelations, it was considered to be a precursor to the end of days."
34,00:02:20,00:02:23,"Well, it certainly was for this poor guy."
35,00:02:58,00:03:00,(camera shutter clicks)
36,00:03:00,00:03:02,"STOKES: No tire tracks, no footprints."
37,00:03:02,00:03:04,I can't even see my own.
38,00:03:06,00:03:09,He's not dressed for hiking. Mm-mm.
39,00:03:09,00:03:10,He had to get out here some way.
40,00:03:10,00:03:12,"Well, there's no ID on him."
41,00:03:16,00:03:18,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
42,00:03:18,00:03:21,Where is the bug man when you need him?
43,00:03:21,00:03:23,"I'm right here, buddy."
44,00:03:25,00:03:28,What is that?
45,00:03:28,00:03:30,That is a long-horned beetle.
46,00:03:33,00:03:38,"Nick, there's something else in his mouth, and it's not moving."
47,00:03:43,00:03:45,(camera shutter clicks)
48,00:03:45,00:03:47,LANGSTON: Hair.
49,00:03:47,00:03:48,Maybe he got a piece of his attacker.
50,00:03:48,00:03:50,(Velcro tears) Mm-hmm.
51,00:03:50,00:03:51,"Guys, I'm gonna need some bigger tools."
52,00:03:51,00:03:52,"Yeah, okay."
53,00:03:56,00:04:00,I've got some ligature marks on his wrist.
54,00:04:00,00:04:02,"You check the other one, will you?"
55,00:04:04,00:04:06,"Yeah, same thing over here."
56,00:04:06,00:04:10,But these patterns are inconsistent with this barbed wire.
57,00:04:10,00:04:13,"(groans) Stop, please stop!"
58,00:04:13,00:04:15,STOKES: Looks like somebody brought chains to the party.
59,00:04:15,00:04:19,Do you see these abrasions and cuts here in the chest?
60,00:04:19,00:04:22,They appear to have been made by the barbed wire.
61,00:04:22,00:04:27,"Hmm... So, our victim ran into the barbed- wire fence, and then..."
62,00:04:27,00:04:30,our killer... turned him around.
63,00:04:32,00:04:33,(groans)
64,00:04:34,00:04:36,Killer wanted to look him in the eye.
65,00:04:36,00:04:38,It would have made the killer feel very powerful.
66,00:04:38,00:04:41,"Hang on, now, Super Dave."
67,00:04:41,00:04:43,You just gonna chop him up?
68,00:04:43,00:04:48,"Oh, Dr. Robbins said that he wanted the head with the pike, and the body with the fence."
69,00:04:48,00:04:50,I'll take the saw. Okay.
70,00:04:53,00:04:55,I'll grab the head? Yep.
71,00:04:55,00:04:57,Ready? Mm-hmm.
72,00:04:57,00:04:58,(saw buzzes)
73,00:05:00,00:05:02,ROBBINS (grunting): Okay.
74,00:05:02,00:05:04,It's like trying to get meat off a shish kebab.
75,00:05:04,00:05:06,(grunting)
76,00:05:06,00:05:08,You all right?
77,00:05:08,00:05:09,Yeah. Yeah.
78,00:05:11,00:05:14,"Give me a hand, David. Mm-hmm."
79,00:05:17,00:05:24,"The post went through the trachea, soft palate, and all the way into the brain."
80,00:05:25,00:05:29,Thank you. Yeah.
81,00:05:29,00:05:30,Heads or tails?
82,00:05:30,00:05:31,I'll take heads.
83,00:05:47,00:05:48,(saw buzzing)
84,00:06:03,00:06:07,Lizzie Borden got an axe and gave her mother 40 whacks.
85,00:06:07,00:06:13,"Contrary to the poem, Lizzie Borden gave her parents a total of 29 whacks."
86,00:06:13,00:06:22,"In this case, we won't know the number of whacks or the type of weapon that did the whacking until we boil off the flesh and examine the tool marks."
87,00:06:24,00:06:26,(camera shutter clicks)
88,00:06:33,00:06:37,He has got symmetrical scars on both palms.
89,00:06:37,00:06:40,That would support the theory that we're dealing with some kind of cult.
90,00:06:40,00:06:41,Bloodletting is a common practice.
91,00:06:41,00:06:42,Abrasions are deep.
92,00:06:42,00:06:44,He struggled.
93,00:06:44,00:06:46,"It's a powerful thing, the will to live."
94,00:06:48,00:06:50,"Well, so is the will to kill."
95,00:06:50,00:06:54,Looks like more than a dozen chop marks.
96,00:06:57,00:06:59,Whoa.
97,00:06:59,00:07:01,The water's beading.
98,00:07:03,00:07:08,Lotions and massage oils make water run off the skin like this. Yeah.
99,00:07:08,00:07:11,This man has very little body hair.
100,00:07:11,00:07:13,He's been waxed.
101,00:07:13,00:07:17,From head to toe.
102,00:07:17,00:07:19,And... everywhere in-between.
103,00:07:20,00:07:23,LANGSTON: Doesn't seem to be any hair regrowth.
104,00:07:23,00:07:25,This was done recently.
105,00:07:31,00:07:34,The thing about wax is...
106,00:07:34,00:07:36,it likes to stick around.
107,00:07:36,00:07:38,I'll get this to Hodges.
108,00:07:38,00:07:40,Hey. I ran our vic's prints through AFIS.
109,00:07:40,00:07:44,"He's not in the system, and no one matching his description has been reported missing."
110,00:07:44,00:07:47,"Well, if he's a tourist, it could be that no one knows he's gone yet."
111,00:07:47,00:07:52,"I got his photo out to all the hotels, so maybe somebody will recognize him."
112,00:07:53,00:07:55,"You know, uh, last night... Mm-hmm?"
113,00:07:55,00:07:57,was... Really great.
114,00:07:57,00:07:59,We gotta do that more often.
115,00:07:59,00:08:01,"Yeah, why don't you move in with me?"
116,00:08:01,00:08:03,What did you just say?
117,00:08:03,00:08:06,(chuckles)
118,00:08:06,00:08:08,"Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm serious."
119,00:08:08,00:08:10,I'd like to make dinner for you every night.
120,00:08:10,00:08:13,"Maybe a little breakfast in bed, if you're good."
121,00:08:13,00:08:14,That sounds nice.
122,00:08:16,00:08:18,I... I'll talk to you later.
123,00:08:18,00:08:20,Yeah.
124,00:08:24,00:08:26,I always imagined Wendy and me moving in together.
125,00:08:26,00:08:28,Cuddling on the couch. Watching theIron Chef.
126,00:08:28,00:08:30,Battle Garbanzo Bean was our favorite.
127,00:08:30,00:08:32,Do you have something for me?
128,00:08:32,00:08:35,"Olive oil, rosemary, and a little lemon juice."
129,00:08:35,00:08:40,"Salad dressing. Yeah, you throw in a balsamic, and you have a vinaigrette, but in this case..."
130,00:08:40,00:08:45,It's the ingredients in the wax that was used on your victim for his extensive man-scaping.
131,00:08:45,00:08:47,Double ouch.
132,00:08:47,00:08:50,I used to go to the Anubis Spa.
133,00:08:50,00:08:54,They had this sugar-based wax which is similar to what they used in ancient Egypt.
134,00:08:54,00:08:56,So an olive oil-based wax...
135,00:08:56,00:08:59,I'm guessing the Mediterranean Hotel?
136,00:09:00,00:09:05,STOKES: So the hotel spa confirmed that Michael Wilson had a full-body wax there three days ago.
137,00:09:05,00:09:06,"Should be the room up here, huh?"
138,00:09:06,00:09:08,"Yeah. Yeah, it's right here."
139,00:09:08,00:09:11,Front desk recognized the photograph that Vartann's been shopping around.
140,00:09:11,00:09:15,Said that Wilson came in from San Diego and he's here for some kind of convention. Hmm.
141,00:09:15,00:09:17,"(beeping, door latch clicks)"
142,00:09:22,00:09:24,STOKES: Obvious signs of a struggle.
143,00:09:24,00:09:31,"LANGSTON: It would be pretty hard to take someone out of a hotel room against their will without getting caught on camera, right?"
144,00:09:31,00:09:32,I'll pull surveillance.
145,00:09:38,00:09:41,Looks like Mr. Wilson was here for a special occasion.
146,00:09:41,00:09:42,STOKES: Yeah? (camera clicks)
147,00:09:45,00:09:51,"""Today and for all eternity-- I dedicate my soul to you."" I love you, too, honey."
148,00:09:51,00:09:53,They're wedding vows.
149,00:09:53,00:09:54,He was getting married.
150,00:09:58,00:10:00,STOKES: Found a yellow contact lens.
151,00:10:00,00:10:02,That's an unusual color.
152,00:10:02,00:10:05,Victim wasn't wearing contacts.
153,00:10:11,00:10:13,Huh.
154,00:10:13,00:10:15,A Celtic love knot.
155,00:10:15,00:10:19,"It's where, uh, the expression ""tying the knot"" came from, you know. Uh-huh."
156,00:10:19,00:10:22,I got a couple of receipts here.
157,00:10:22,00:10:30,"One for flowers, one for a cake, and according to this, they're supposed to be delivered to the Unity Room of this hotel on the seventh."
158,00:10:30,00:10:32,The wedding's today.
159,00:10:32,00:10:35,(organ playing somber dirge)
160,00:10:44,00:10:46,(hissing)
161,00:10:47,00:10:49,(snarls)
162,00:10:49,00:10:51,"You wouldn't happen to have any garlic on you, would you?"
163,00:10:51,00:10:52,"No, I'm fresh out."
164,00:10:52,00:10:54,Ah.
165,00:10:54,00:10:56,(hisses)
166,00:11:03,00:11:06,I think I'm going to be sick.
167,00:11:06,00:11:07,"Julie, we just have a few more questions."
168,00:11:07,00:11:09,MAN: Hasn't she been through enough?
169,00:11:09,00:11:10,I'm going to put a stop to this.
170,00:11:10,00:11:12,Your kind clearly have no right to badger her like this.
171,00:11:12,00:11:14,"""Our kind""?"
172,00:11:14,00:11:16,"Mr. Stewart, a young man has been brutally murdered."
173,00:11:16,00:11:18,We have every right to be here.
174,00:11:18,00:11:20,"And as far as I'm concerned, you can drop the act."
175,00:11:20,00:11:25,"The act? Miss Crenshaw, when was the last time that you saw your fiancé?"
176,00:11:25,00:11:27,"Uh, yesterday afternoon..."
177,00:11:27,00:11:28,when we rehearsed the ceremony.
178,00:11:28,00:11:29,So roughly 24 hours ago.
179,00:11:29,00:11:33,They didn't want to see each other before the wedding. It's tradition.
180,00:11:33,00:11:39,We embrace the... the principles and the morals of centuries past.
181,00:11:39,00:11:43,"Not like the present, where you drive through a chapel and Elvis will hand you a license."
182,00:11:43,00:11:48,"As to Michael's state of mind last night-- did he seem agitated, or... unsettled?"
183,00:11:48,00:11:49,MAN 2: No.
184,00:11:49,00:11:52,Michael was about to marry the love of his life.
185,00:11:52,00:11:54,I've never seen anyone so happy.
186,00:11:54,00:11:57,"Ethan. You're the best man, right?"
187,00:11:57,00:11:58,Right.
188,00:11:58,00:12:00,So you were in charge of the bachelor party?
189,00:12:00,00:12:03,Bachelor party?
190,00:12:03,00:12:06,"Yeah, did you guys party like a rap star last night, or what?"
191,00:12:06,00:12:08,We simply dined.
192,00:12:08,00:12:11,Then Michael went back to his room to work on his vows and meditate.
193,00:12:11,00:12:12,Vampires meditate?
194,00:12:12,00:12:17,A true vampiric state can only be achieved through discipline and self-control.
195,00:12:17,00:12:20,LANGSTON: Self-control wasn't exercised in Michael's hotel room.
196,00:12:20,00:12:22,The place was completely trashed.
197,00:12:22,00:12:24,This is all my fault.
198,00:12:24,00:12:27,I was the one who wanted to get married at the convention.
199,00:12:27,00:12:28,Where they let anyone in.
200,00:12:28,00:12:32,"All of our friends were going to be here, anyway."
201,00:12:32,00:12:34,I wanted them to see how happy we were.
202,00:12:34,00:12:38,"Let's go back to where they let everyone in. Who's ""everyone""?"
203,00:12:38,00:12:40,This is a Covens and Clans convention.
204,00:12:41,00:12:46,"Vampires, and... unfortunately werewolves."
205,00:12:46,00:12:48,Mr. Stewart...
206,00:12:48,00:12:51,"May I see your hand, please?"
207,00:12:52,00:12:53,Huh.
208,00:12:53,00:12:55,Miss Crenshaw?
209,00:12:59,00:13:04,We found the same scar on Michael's palms.
210,00:13:04,00:13:07,"In the movies, vampires thirst for blood. Well..."
211,00:13:07,00:13:09,we're not sanguinarians.
212,00:13:09,00:13:10,"For us, blood is a..."
213,00:13:10,00:13:13,a symbol of the life force that flows through us.
214,00:13:13,00:13:18,We shed our blood in ceremonies to bind one another together.
215,00:13:21,00:13:25,"Whoever killed Michael put a stake in my heart, too."
216,00:13:28,00:13:32,This has Van Helsing written all over it.
217,00:13:32,00:13:34,The vampire slayer? Mm-hmm.
218,00:13:34,00:13:36,I thought he just staked them through the heart.
219,00:13:36,00:13:38,The staking was just to keep them in their coffins.
220,00:13:38,00:13:41,"If you really want to kill a vampire, you have to cut off his head."
221,00:13:41,00:13:44,Only this guy wasn't a real vampire.
222,00:13:44,00:13:46,"Well, someone thought so."
223,00:13:46,00:13:53,"You know, a few years ago, in Romania, a family dug up their dead relative because they thought he was a vampire."
224,00:13:53,00:13:59,"They ripped out his heart, burned it, mixed the ashes with water, and then drank it."
225,00:13:59,00:14:01,Seriously?
226,00:14:01,00:14:09,"And, much like you, the Romanian police didn't believe in vampires, so they charged the family with abusing a corpse."
227,00:14:09,00:14:11,Served three years in prison.
228,00:14:11,00:14:14,But the townspeople thought they were heroes.
229,00:14:16,00:14:19,Individual stria match.
230,00:14:19,00:14:22,A single tool made all these cuts.
231,00:14:24,00:14:29,"Depth impressions range from one-to-three-eighths of an inch, indicating varying degrees of force."
232,00:14:29,00:14:36,"The killer used a curved, heavy-headed blade, most likely an axe or a hatchet."
233,00:14:36,00:14:38,(rock music plays)
234,00:14:38,00:14:41,"Yeah, okay. Thanks, Arch."
235,00:14:43,00:14:44,(snarls)
236,00:14:44,00:14:46,"Well, so much for our abduction theory."
237,00:14:46,00:14:50,Surveillance confirmed that Michael Wilson left the hotel at midnight by himself.
238,00:14:50,00:14:52,LANGSTON: There had to be some kind of altercation.
239,00:14:52,00:14:54,You did see his room.
240,00:14:54,00:14:58,"Yeah, whoever started it probably finished it at Mount Charleston."
241,00:14:58,00:15:00,"Ah, whoa. (laughs deeply)"
242,00:15:00,00:15:01,What do you think?
243,00:15:01,00:15:03,Creepy. Yeah.
244,00:15:03,00:15:04,I do feel powerful.
245,00:15:04,00:15:07,"I feel... you know, dangerous. Hmm?"
246,00:15:07,00:15:13,I think maybe the reason these people dress up like these creatures is to help them embrace their dark side.
247,00:15:13,00:15:14,"Yeah, yeah, no, I get it."
248,00:15:14,00:15:16,"You kinda scared me for a minute there. Okay, okay."
249,00:15:16,00:15:20,Same contact lens as the one that we found in Michael Wilson's room.
250,00:15:20,00:15:23,They've sold 500 of these at this convention in the last two days.
251,00:15:23,00:15:25,"Well, great. That's impossible to trace."
252,00:15:25,00:15:27,We'd better hope DNA comes through.
253,00:15:27,00:15:29,(sighs): Yeah.
254,00:15:29,00:15:31,Wow.
255,00:15:31,00:15:34,Cool eyes. Mom!
256,00:15:34,00:15:36,I need your credit card.
257,00:15:36,00:15:38,I think you just turned another one over to the dark side.
258,00:15:38,00:15:40,(chuckles)
259,00:15:41,00:15:43,That's nice... nice...
260,00:15:43,00:15:45,"Remember, you're undead."
261,00:15:45,00:15:46,Ow.
262,00:15:47,00:15:53,"STOKES: So you think it's the neck biting, the bloodsucking, or the carnal sex that's the appeal?"
263,00:15:53,00:15:55,LANGSTON: It's probably all of the above.
264,00:15:55,00:15:56,"Once you mate, it's for life."
265,00:15:56,00:15:59,"You know, if it's worth, uh, living for..."
266,00:16:00,00:16:03,...it's also worth dying for.
267,00:16:05,00:16:06,WOMAN (over P.A.): Wiccans...
268,00:16:06,00:16:13,"bring your best spells and potions to the sharing circle, when the hour strikes..."
269,00:16:13,00:16:16,STOKES: Whew! That's quite an arsenal.
270,00:16:16,00:16:19,I didn't realize that vampires and werewolves needed weapons.
271,00:16:19,00:16:22,"Oh, they don't. You do."
272,00:16:23,00:16:24,"Back to work, honey."
273,00:16:24,00:16:26,Don't flirt with the dogs.
274,00:16:26,00:16:29,It's slay or be slayed out there.
275,00:16:29,00:16:32,"So have you ever used one of these weapons to, uh, slay a vampire yourself?"
276,00:16:32,00:16:34,(chuckles)
277,00:16:34,00:16:36,If these blades could talk.
278,00:16:36,00:16:39,"No, but seriously, can I tell you guys something?"
279,00:16:40,00:16:43,I'm a direct descendant of the great Van Helsing.
280,00:16:43,00:16:44,Really?
281,00:16:44,00:16:46,Yeah. So...
282,00:16:46,00:16:48,Ridding the world of monsters is in my blood.
283,00:16:49,00:16:52,I've seen the evil they can do.
284,00:16:52,00:16:55,"Killing machines, really. No conscience, no mercy."
285,00:16:55,00:17:00,"So what kind of weapon would you recommend to, say, decapitate a vampire?"
286,00:17:00,00:17:03,"Ooh, I like how you think."
287,00:17:03,00:17:08,I would go with the TransVlad 5000.
288,00:17:08,00:17:10,Top o' the line.
289,00:17:10,00:17:15,"Stainless steel, leather-wrapped handle, And how much does that set you back?"
290,00:17:15,00:17:18,"Well, for you young slayers, I could do..."
291,00:17:18,00:17:19,450 bucks.
292,00:17:19,00:17:22,Yeah. Kinda steep. That's a little pricey.
293,00:17:22,00:17:23,"Well, why don't you let meslashthe price?!"
294,00:17:23,00:17:25,"$425, just for today."
295,00:17:25,00:17:30,We were thinking of something more along the lines of the axe or hatchet family?
296,00:17:30,00:17:31,I get it.
297,00:17:31,00:17:33,You guys are on some kind of budget.
298,00:17:33,00:17:35,You're not yanking my chain here.
299,00:17:35,00:17:36,You're not wasting my time?
300,00:17:36,00:17:37,'Cause I might have to...
301,00:17:37,00:17:39,(makes slicing noise) ...decapitate you!
302,00:17:39,00:17:41,I'm just kidding.
303,00:17:41,00:17:42,"Honey, can you get me the wood axe?"
304,00:17:44,00:17:47,(muttering)
305,00:17:47,00:17:50,"If he doesn't die, he'll-he'll have to get a tetanus shot."
306,00:17:50,00:17:56,"No, but seriously, this might do the trick on your entry-level blood junkies, but, uh, no guarantees."
307,00:17:56,00:17:59,And... (makes stabbing noise)... no returns.
308,00:17:59,00:18:04,"Heavy head, curved blade about five inches long."
309,00:18:04,00:18:05,How many of these have you sold?
310,00:18:05,00:18:06,None.
311,00:18:06,00:18:10,"People usually go for the crossbows, or the... or the scimitars."
312,00:18:10,00:18:13,They don't go for something you could get at Home Depot.
313,00:18:13,00:18:15,We'll take it. We'll take it.
314,00:18:30,00:18:32,"(laughs): Oh, man."
315,00:18:32,00:18:34,Sorry.
316,00:18:34,00:18:37,"That's okay, this shirt was begging for it."
317,00:18:37,00:18:38,"Recreating the event, I see."
318,00:18:38,00:18:41,Analyzing tool marks and blood spatter.
319,00:18:41,00:18:45,"According to Doc Robbins, Michael Wilson was struck no less than 18 times."
320,00:18:45,00:18:46,How many you up to? About 11.
321,00:18:46,00:18:53,"I keep trying to hit the same place twice, but every time I miss, I have to start over again, and my hand is killing me."
322,00:18:53,00:18:54,Want to let me give it a whack?
323,00:18:54,00:18:57,All right.
324,00:18:58,00:19:04,"You know my PawPaw used to say the great thing about wood is it warms you up twice: once when you chop it, and once when you burn it."
325,00:19:04,00:19:06,(chuckles)
326,00:19:16,00:19:20,"That's my five, your 11, that makes 16."
327,00:19:20,00:19:21,I think we shaved a couple off the killer's total.
328,00:19:24,00:19:26,"Come take a look at this with me, will you?"
329,00:19:35,00:19:37,The victim was struck from all sides.
330,00:19:37,00:19:40,That's very difficult to do with a guy who's chained to a fence.
331,00:19:40,00:19:44,"That would mean the killer hopped the fence, so he could take shots from the other side."
332,00:19:56,00:19:57,(groans)
333,00:19:57,00:20:02,Why do that? We just proved you can get the job done standing in the same spot.
334,00:20:02,00:20:04,Maybe he didn't know that.
335,00:20:04,00:20:06,There is another possibility.
336,00:20:06,00:20:09,Maybe he wasn't alone.
337,00:20:15,00:20:17,HODGES: That's a hair we found in your victim's mouth.
338,00:20:17,00:20:19,Scale patterns are mosaic.
339,00:20:19,00:20:21,It's not human.
340,00:20:21,00:20:24,I ran it against this exemplar.
341,00:20:24,00:20:27,Canis lupus.
342,00:20:27,00:20:28,Wolf hair?
343,00:20:28,00:20:30,"Or, maybe... werewolf."
344,00:20:30,00:20:33,I have been doing extensive research.
345,00:20:33,00:20:37,"According to the legend, vampires enslaved werewolves during the Trajanic War."
346,00:20:37,00:20:40,"Werewolves revolted, and they've been mortal enemies ever since."
347,00:20:40,00:20:42,Like Cain and Abel.
348,00:20:42,00:20:44,Romulus and Remus.
349,00:20:44,00:20:45,Tom and Jerry. I get it.
350,00:20:45,00:20:48,There were a lot of werewolves at that convention.
351,00:20:48,00:20:54,"But as scientists, we know that wannabe werewolves cannot physically transform themselves into wolves."
352,00:20:54,00:20:56,"So, where did this hair come from?"
353,00:20:56,00:20:59,Perhaps one of them has a four-legged companion.
354,00:20:59,00:21:01,They say that people look like their dogs.
355,00:21:01,00:21:04,Greg's running canine CODIS right now.
356,00:21:04,00:21:05,Thank you.
357,00:21:05,00:21:12,"Um, out of curiosity-- uh, will you and Detective Vartann be sharing your house or his?"
358,00:21:12,00:21:13,Really none of your business.
359,00:21:13,00:21:24,"I had love in my grasp, and I let it slip through my fingers, and I don't know if I'll ever be able to forgive myself."
360,00:21:25,00:21:28,It's a terrible thing to wake up to every day.
361,00:21:30,00:21:33,I'll... keep that in mind.
362,00:21:37,00:21:39,Your wolf's in the system.
363,00:21:39,00:21:41,His name's Timber.
364,00:21:41,00:21:42,"WILLOWS: Hmm, how original."
365,00:21:42,00:21:47,"He was entered into canine CODIS two years ago, when his owner assaulted someone in front of the Tangiers."
366,00:21:47,00:21:50,"Timber, here, joined in on the fight."
367,00:21:50,00:21:51,Wolves don't normally attack humans.
368,00:21:51,00:21:52,"Blame the owner, not the wolf."
369,00:21:52,00:21:54,Who's the owner?
370,00:21:54,00:21:56,Kurt Francis. He's also in the system.
371,00:21:56,00:21:59,"Multiple assaults, drunk and disorderly, DUI..."
372,00:21:59,00:22:01,SANDERS: He's registered at the convention.
373,00:22:01,00:22:03,He's the leader of a werewolf pack.
374,00:22:03,00:22:06,"Well, we're looking for multiple attackers."
375,00:22:06,00:22:08,SIDLE: Wolves do hunt in packs.
376,00:22:08,00:22:10,"Maybe werewolves do, too."
377,00:22:10,00:22:13,"(low growls, laughter) MAN: Get your glasses up. Come on. Come on."
378,00:22:13,00:22:16,Looks like we need another round. Sorry.
379,00:22:16,00:22:18,Who's buying another round?
380,00:22:18,00:22:20,"Yo, yo, check her out. (howls)"
381,00:22:20,00:22:22,"Sorry, guys..."
382,00:22:22,00:22:25,That is a nice piece of meat. Mm.
383,00:22:25,00:22:27,"MAN: You're right, Kurtis. Sweet!"
384,00:22:33,00:22:35,"How about it, honey? How about a lap dance?"
385,00:22:35,00:22:36,"Whoa, whoa."
386,00:22:36,00:22:38,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you going?"
387,00:22:38,00:22:39,"Come on! (indistinct shouts, laughter)"
388,00:22:39,00:22:41,WOMAN: No! Get your hands off of me!
389,00:22:41,00:22:43,Come on! Ah!
390,00:22:43,00:22:45,You're hurting me! Get your hands off of her.
391,00:22:45,00:22:47,"What do you think you're doing with that stick, old man?"
392,00:22:47,00:22:50,"STOKES: Relax, relax, relax. Everybody be cool now."
393,00:22:50,00:22:51,"Be cool now, boys."
394,00:22:51,00:22:53,"Just relax. Move it along, old man."
395,00:22:53,00:22:55,What is that?
396,00:22:55,00:22:56,Is that wolf hair?
397,00:22:58,00:22:59,STOKES: Back up!
398,00:22:59,00:23:00,Back up!
399,00:23:01,00:23:03,Back up!
400,00:23:04,00:23:09,The hold I have you in is called a lateral vascular hold.
401,00:23:09,00:23:17,"The discomfort you're feeling is my forefinger and thumb constricting your airway, cutting off the oxygen to your brain."
402,00:23:17,00:23:21,(gasping) You should pass out right about...
403,00:23:21,00:23:23,now.
404,00:23:27,00:23:30,Why don't one of you take these chains off of me and give me my vest back?
405,00:23:30,00:23:32,"Well, you can't have it back."
406,00:23:32,00:23:39,"You know, when I was a kid, we had a dog, and when he died we never once considered turning him into a jacket."
407,00:23:39,00:23:40,"Eh, never."
408,00:23:40,00:23:43,Timber was a loyal member of the pack.
409,00:23:43,00:23:45,I wanted to keep him with me.
410,00:23:45,00:23:49,"We found some of Timber's hair in the teeth of a murder victim, Michael Wilson."
411,00:23:49,00:23:50,Who?
412,00:23:50,00:23:51,Michael Wilson.
413,00:23:51,00:23:56,"He was at your convention-- he was of the vampire persuasion. Well, I don't hang with parasites."
414,00:23:56,00:23:57,"Well, you should think about it."
415,00:23:57,00:23:58,"I mean, you have a lot in common."
416,00:23:58,00:24:00,You're in the same movies.
417,00:24:00,00:24:04,"LANGSTON: You know, there's a creature in the Philippines called anaswang."
418,00:24:04,00:24:06,A what? Aswang.
419,00:24:06,00:24:08,It's a half-breed.
420,00:24:08,00:24:09,"Half vampire, half werewolf."
421,00:24:09,00:24:13,We are nothing like those bloodsuckers.
422,00:24:13,00:24:16,"There's a reason why they hide in the dark, you know?"
423,00:24:16,00:24:18,Act like the elite.
424,00:24:18,00:24:20,"Pretend to be, uh..."
425,00:24:20,00:24:22,refined.
426,00:24:22,00:24:25,"You see, us animals..."
427,00:24:25,00:24:27,we're honest.
428,00:24:27,00:24:30,We follow our instincts.
429,00:24:30,00:24:32,We give in to our urges.
430,00:24:32,00:24:34,Like the urge to kill.
431,00:24:34,00:24:37,We found a contact lens in Michael Wilson's hotel room.
432,00:24:37,00:24:39,The DNA says it's yours.
433,00:24:41,00:24:42,Kurt.
434,00:24:44,00:24:47,I think you're taking this mortal enemy thing a little too far.
435,00:24:47,00:24:51,"Now, where were you two nights ago?"
436,00:24:51,00:24:53,I don't remember.
437,00:24:53,00:24:55,"There was a full moon, and I shifted."
438,00:24:57,00:25:02,"You shifted? When there's a full moon, I'mnot as strong, Ican't control it."
439,00:25:02,00:25:04,(hits table with cane)
440,00:25:04,00:25:08,Can you remember where you were when the sun came up?
441,00:25:08,00:25:10,I was in my car.
442,00:25:10,00:25:13,Where was your car?
443,00:25:13,00:25:17,"Self-park garage at the Mediterranean, level three."
444,00:25:17,00:25:20,(quietly): Good dog.
445,00:25:22,00:25:23,SIDLE: This car is a gas guzzler.
446,00:25:23,00:25:27,You'd think a wolf would be more environmentally conscious.
447,00:25:29,00:25:31,Oh...
448,00:25:32,00:25:37,I think I know why Kurt Francis couldn't remember what happened last night.
449,00:25:37,00:25:39,That pooch has been hitting the hooch.
450,00:25:39,00:25:44,"It's not the moonlight that turns them into a beast, it's the moonshine."
451,00:25:45,00:25:47,SIDLE: Got some dog collars.
452,00:25:50,00:25:52,Similar pattern to the ligature marks.
453,00:25:52,00:25:57,It's probable that Kurt and his pack used these to restrain Michael Wilson.
454,00:25:57,00:26:01,SANDERS: There's spatter on the passenger door.
455,00:26:09,00:26:11,Positive for blood.
456,00:26:11,00:26:16,The truck might have been parked near the fence when they were killing Michael.
457,00:26:18,00:26:21,"Well, there's blood in the window well, too."
458,00:26:21,00:26:23,A lot of it.
459,00:26:23,00:26:25,The window must have been open.
460,00:26:25,00:26:30,"Then why isn't there any blood inside the truck, on the seats?"
461,00:26:30,00:26:32,What is that smell?
462,00:26:32,00:26:36,"Vomit. Is that really what we're gonna talk about right now, man? I'm eating."
463,00:26:36,00:26:38,"Well, you're always eating."
464,00:26:38,00:26:39,You were saying?
465,00:26:39,00:26:42,The blood on Kurt Francis's truck came back to the vic.
466,00:26:42,00:26:46,But mixed in with it were traces of pepsinogen and hydrochloric acid.
467,00:26:46,00:26:48,STOKES: Digestive enzymes.
468,00:26:48,00:26:52,"Yeah, someone drank Michael Wilson's blood and then puked it out the window."
469,00:26:52,00:26:54,"Yeah, Kurt Francis. No. It did not come back to Kurt Francis."
470,00:26:57,00:26:59,Of course-- a vampire.
471,00:26:59,00:27:04,"If we accept the mythology, werewolves don't drink blood, vampires do."
472,00:27:04,00:27:08,"So, what was a vampire doing in Kurt Francis's truck?"
473,00:27:08,00:27:10,Don't they hate each other? Mm-hmm.
474,00:27:10,00:27:16,"I can't tell you why they were carpooling, but I can tell you that the vampire we're looking for is sick."
475,00:27:16,00:27:21,Hodges found traces of hematin and mesoporphyrin in the vomit.
476,00:27:21,00:27:23,Both of those are used to treat porphyria.
477,00:27:23,00:27:30,"It's a blood disorder; it's also known as the ""vampire disease."" Well, you know, we had a case about ten years ago where the killer had porphyria."
478,00:27:30,00:27:34,Remember? She chopped up her victims and turned them into protein shakes.
479,00:27:34,00:27:36,"(gags, coughs)"
480,00:27:36,00:27:37,"(laughs) I'm sorry, man."
481,00:27:37,00:27:38,(coughs) It's all right.
482,00:27:38,00:27:42,So we're not just looking for a vampire poser.
483,00:27:42,00:27:45,We're looking for a sanguinarian.
484,00:27:49,00:27:53,"THOMAS: By sharing our blood with Michael, he takes a part of each of us into the next world."
485,00:27:53,00:27:55,"It's one in life, one in death."
486,00:27:55,00:27:56,It's how we honor our dead.
487,00:27:56,00:27:59,"Well, may a stranger offer a few words?"
488,00:27:59,00:28:00,"Uh, no, actually. Thank you."
489,00:28:00,00:28:02,Thank you.
490,00:28:02,00:28:06,Michael lived and died as...
491,00:28:06,00:28:07,a vampire.
492,00:28:07,00:28:09,A being hated for centuries.
493,00:28:09,00:28:14,"Hatred is born of fear, fear of things we don't understand."
494,00:28:14,00:28:23,"In medieval times, for example, when someone saw a bloated corpse with blood running from its mouth, they believed it was a vampire such as yourselves."
495,00:28:23,00:28:28,Science now teaches us that that's just part of the decomposition process.
496,00:28:28,00:28:33,It's simply gasses purging fluids from the body through the nose and from the mouth.
497,00:28:33,00:28:35,This is highly inappropriate at a memorial service.
498,00:28:35,00:28:37,"STOKES: You know, you're right, Thomas."
499,00:28:37,00:28:39,"This is a somber occasion, Dr. Ray."
500,00:28:39,00:28:41,Maybe we should lighten things up a little bit.
501,00:28:41,00:28:42,Maybe we should.
502,00:28:42,00:28:45,"LANGSTON: What does it say in the Good Book, Nick?"
503,00:28:45,00:28:48,"""Let there be light."" (others gasping)"
504,00:28:51,00:28:56,Science has a way of revealing other truths about vampires.
505,00:28:56,00:28:59,Like... your acute sensitivity to sunlight.
506,00:28:59,00:29:04,It's actually a symptom of a medical condition called porphyria.
507,00:29:06,00:29:08,Even...
508,00:29:08,00:29:14,brief exposure to sunlight can cause your skin to...
509,00:29:15,00:29:17,...burn...
510,00:29:17,00:29:19,and blister.
511,00:29:20,00:29:25,STOKES: The great thing about science is that it always sheds light on the subject.
512,00:29:26,00:29:27,I didn't kill Michael.
513,00:29:27,00:29:29,"When I found him, he was already dead."
514,00:29:29,00:29:33,"So you thought, why let all that good blood go to waste?"
515,00:29:33,00:29:37,"You know, I take offense to that. You said yourself that your coven doesn't drink blood. No, we don't."
516,00:29:37,00:29:39,I made an exception for Michael.
517,00:29:39,00:29:40,Why?
518,00:29:40,00:29:43,Because I wanted his soul to live on through me.
519,00:29:44,00:29:47,They lured him to the mountain.
520,00:29:47,00:29:51,"I tried to get there in time to save him, but I was too late. Yeah? Who's ""they""?"
521,00:29:51,00:29:52,Wolves.
522,00:29:52,00:29:55,They had their noses open that night.
523,00:29:55,00:29:58,"You know, there's only one problem with your story, Thomas."
524,00:29:58,00:30:06,You hitched a ride back to town with the leader of the wolf pack. The evidence tells us that you and Kurt Francis killed Michael together.
525,00:30:14,00:30:19,"See, the thing about drinking human blood is, our bodies lack the enzymes to break it down properly."
526,00:30:19,00:30:20,It induces vomiting.
527,00:30:20,00:30:24,"I understand why the werewolves would want Michael dead, but..."
528,00:30:24,00:30:26,why wouldheturn against one of his own?
529,00:30:26,00:30:29,Maybe Michael lost faith.
530,00:30:29,00:30:36,Maybe Michael started to see you for what you really are: a frustrated Web site designer from London.
531,00:30:36,00:30:38,Or maybe it was about the girl.
532,00:30:38,00:30:40,Julie.
533,00:30:40,00:30:43,"You wanted her all to yourself, didn't you?"
534,00:30:46,00:30:48,I want a lawyer.
535,00:30:50,00:30:54,LANGSTON: The yellow contact lens puts Kurt Francis in Michael Wilson's hotel room.
536,00:30:54,00:30:58,Michael's blood in Kurt's car puts him at the crime scene along with Thomas Stewart.
537,00:30:58,00:31:02,"But without the murder weapon, we can't prove that either of them killed Michael."
538,00:31:02,00:31:06,"Right.Butwhen Nick and I hacked off Jell-O Man's head, we were covered with blood."
539,00:31:06,00:31:08,So if Kurt and Thomas hacked off Michael's head...
540,00:31:08,00:31:10,The clothes should prove it.
541,00:31:10,00:31:11,They should.
542,00:32:02,00:32:05,"You know, there should be a lot more blood than this."
543,00:32:05,00:32:07,WILLOWS: Could be castoff from simply being at the scene.
544,00:32:07,00:32:10,All it proves is that Kurt and Thomas were there.
545,00:32:10,00:32:12,"SIDLE: Well, at theleast, they were there."
546,00:32:12,00:32:15,"If they only took one or two swings, that could account for the lack of blood."
547,00:32:15,00:32:24,"He was hit with an axe at least 18 times, so whether they were just there or they took a couple of swings, it means that someone else took the rest of the swings. Yeah. Yeah, another wolf."
548,00:32:24,00:32:26,Or another vampire.
549,00:32:26,00:32:31,HODGES: I admit that a black cloak does lend a gentleman a certain kind of mysterious allure.
550,00:32:31,00:32:35,There's just one drawback-- it drags along the ground and collects plenty of trace.
551,00:32:35,00:32:38,"What did you find, David? Alpine rock butterweed."
552,00:32:38,00:32:43,"It's a flowering herb that only grows above 2,500 feet on Mount Charleston along the south loop trail."
553,00:32:43,00:32:46,We didn't find any of this stuff at the crime scene.
554,00:32:46,00:32:49,Makes me wonder what else is up there.
555,00:32:49,00:32:51,SIDLE: We know that Michael was running from his attackers.
556,00:32:51,00:32:54,We know that the chase ended at the fence.
557,00:32:54,00:32:56,Where did it begin?
558,00:33:04,00:33:08,"Did you know that a 12-letter word for ""across the woods"" is ""Transylvania""?"
559,00:33:08,00:33:10,Grissom?
560,00:33:10,00:33:11,"Is that you, Grissom?"
561,00:33:11,00:33:12,Shut up.
562,00:33:12,00:33:13,Gil?
563,00:33:13,00:33:15,I don't think he'd appreciate you calling him that either.
564,00:33:15,00:33:16,"No, you don't think so?"
565,00:33:16,00:33:17,I don't.
566,00:33:17,00:33:18,After all this time.
567,00:33:18,00:33:20,That's a shame.
568,00:33:20,00:33:22,"All right, here you go."
569,00:33:22,00:33:24,"I'll see you at 2,500."
570,00:33:24,00:33:27,If you can keep up.
571,00:33:27,00:33:29,(chuckles)
572,00:33:29,00:33:30,(groans)
573,00:33:39,00:33:41,SIDLE: Alpine rock butterweed.
574,00:33:41,00:33:42,STOKES: Mm-hmm.
575,00:33:50,00:33:54,"Big fat tire treads, consistent with Kurt's gas guzzler of a truck."
576,00:33:55,00:33:58,Got something here.
577,00:34:04,00:34:05,Dirt's been disturbed.
578,00:34:16,00:34:19,Another piece.
579,00:34:24,00:34:26,I know this guy.
580,00:34:27,00:34:29,That's Kurt Francis.
581,00:34:36,00:34:38,I can beat that. Yeah?
582,00:34:41,00:34:44,I think somebody tried to bury the hatchet.
583,00:34:47,00:34:51,STOKES: This photo was taken at last year's convention.
584,00:34:51,00:34:55,Do you recognize the werewolf standing next to Kurt Francis?
585,00:34:57,00:34:59,How about now?
586,00:34:59,00:35:00,Michael Wilson.
587,00:35:00,00:35:04,He was part of Kurt's wolf pack?
588,00:35:04,00:35:05,Looks that way.
589,00:35:05,00:35:16,"I think Michael was a wolf who fell for a vampire, but the only way he could have her was to become a vampire himself and hope that nobody recognized him from last year's convention."
590,00:35:16,00:35:19,"WILLOWS: Well, someone obviously recognized him and that someone was Kurt Francis."
591,00:35:19,00:35:26,"STOKES: He followed Michael to his room, he confronted him, and he got in his face."
592,00:35:26,00:35:28,"Once a werewolf, always a werewolf, Michael."
593,00:35:28,00:35:30,We were brothers. You betrayed us for one of them!
594,00:35:30,00:35:31,(grunting)
595,00:35:34,00:35:42,My guess is that Kurt went looking for Thomas to let him know that there was a traitor in his midst.
596,00:35:42,00:35:47,"And for one night and one night only, they joined forces to kill a common enemy."
597,00:35:49,00:35:53,Fluorescein green.
598,00:35:53,00:35:58,Enhances contrast in latent blood.
599,00:35:58,00:35:59,Excellent choice.
600,00:35:59,00:36:02,Thank you.
601,00:36:02,00:36:06,"The handle's been wiped clean, but they didn't get all the blood."
602,00:36:06,00:36:08,There's some patterns in the wood.
603,00:36:09,00:36:11,Huh.
604,00:36:14,00:36:17,I think I've seen this before.
605,00:36:22,00:36:25,Look at this.
606,00:36:25,00:36:27,This is the test axe that Nick and I used on Jell-O Man.
607,00:36:27,00:36:28,Hmm.
608,00:36:28,00:36:30,See the pattern?
609,00:36:30,00:36:32,Similar markings.
610,00:36:32,00:36:33,Right. But not the same.
611,00:36:33,00:36:34,They came from this.
612,00:36:34,00:36:39,"My, uh, my wedding ring made a pattern in blood on the handle."
613,00:36:39,00:36:43,Kurt Francis wears a ring that has a wolf insignia.
614,00:36:45,00:36:47,(camera clicking)
615,00:37:12,00:37:16,That doesn't look like a wolf to me.
616,00:37:21,00:37:23,That's a beautiful engagement ring.
617,00:37:23,00:37:27,Thank you.
618,00:37:27,00:37:32,"It's designed to fit your wedding band, yes?"
619,00:37:33,00:37:34,May I?
620,00:37:37,00:37:41,And the two halves become one.
621,00:37:43,00:37:46,Michael and I liked the symbolism.
622,00:37:47,00:37:49,The idea that we'd be together forever.
623,00:37:49,00:37:53,"Well, we like symbols, too."
624,00:37:53,00:37:58,"They have a way of making an impression, especially in blood."
625,00:37:58,00:38:09,"LANGSTON: When you were swinging that axe at Michael's head again and again, his blood seeped onto the handle of the axe, and your ring left behind an unusual pattern."
626,00:38:09,00:38:13,"You got his blood all over you, on your clothes, in your hair."
627,00:38:13,00:38:15,LANGSTON: CSIs are searching your hotel room right now.
628,00:38:15,00:38:22,"Even if you washed your clothes, even if you took a shower, they'll find evidence of his blood there."
629,00:38:22,00:38:28,"Michael never told you that he used to be a werewolf, did he?"
630,00:38:31,00:38:33,How did you find out?
631,00:38:36,00:38:42,Thomas told Michael and me to meet him at Mount Charleston for a pre-wedding ritual.
632,00:38:42,00:38:45,"As soon as we got there, I knew something was wrong."
633,00:38:52,00:38:56,Thomas ordered Michael to hand over his contacts and his fangs.
634,00:38:59,00:39:00,What are they doing here?
635,00:39:01,00:39:03,Michael?
636,00:39:03,00:39:09,"Michael ran and they ran after him, and by the time I caught up, they had chained Michael to a fence."
637,00:39:09,00:39:11,(Michael screams) JULIE: Stop!
638,00:39:11,00:39:12,Let me go!
639,00:39:12,00:39:14,"Do something, help him. Show her."
640,00:39:14,00:39:15,"MICHAEL: Don't, stop!"
641,00:39:15,00:39:19,Your beloved used to be a werewolf.
642,00:39:22,00:39:26,Michael said he'd seen me at the convention last year.
643,00:39:28,00:39:31,Said he knew we were destined to be together.
644,00:39:31,00:39:35,So he changed who he was because he loved you.
645,00:39:37,00:39:41,Love built on a lie isn't love.
646,00:39:44,00:39:47,You can't be someone you're not.
647,00:39:49,00:39:51,He wasn't one of us.
648,00:39:51,00:39:54,And that didn't sit well with anyone.
649,00:39:54,00:39:56,Did it?
650,00:39:58,00:39:59,THOMAS: Traitors must die.
651,00:39:59,00:40:00,"MICHAEL: Julie, I love you."
652,00:40:00,00:40:02,It doesn't matter what side I'm on!
653,00:40:02,00:40:04,He's not on any side.
654,00:40:04,00:40:07,"He's not one of us, he's never been one of us, and he's not even one of them."
655,00:40:07,00:40:11,"Now, you align yourself to this man, that makes you no better than him."
656,00:40:11,00:40:14,"We're all watching, Julie."
657,00:40:14,00:40:16,Choose.
658,00:40:16,00:40:18,(Michael grunting)
659,00:40:18,00:40:20,MICHAEL: Julie.
660,00:40:20,00:40:22,"Julie, this is all make-believe."
661,00:40:22,00:40:24,"Vampires, werewolves."
662,00:40:24,00:40:26,None of this is real.
663,00:40:26,00:40:30,My love for you-- that's what's real.
664,00:40:30,00:40:33,We can just walk away from all this.
665,00:40:33,00:40:35,Do you really love me?
666,00:40:35,00:40:38,"Yes, with all my heart, I love you."
667,00:40:38,00:40:40,That was your mistake.
668,00:40:41,00:40:44,You can't be you and love me.
669,00:40:44,00:40:46,"No, stop, don't, no!"
670,00:40:46,00:40:49,(Julie yelling)
671,00:40:52,00:41:00,"If you agree to testify against Thomas Stewart and Kurt Francis, you may be able to avoid the death penalty."
672,00:41:03,00:41:06,I killed Michael.
673,00:41:08,00:41:13,"VARTANN: Maybe the, uh, werewolf and vampire can work out a peace treaty while they're sharing a cell."
674,00:41:13,00:41:17,And Julie Crenshaw will be spending her honeymoon behind bars.
675,00:41:17,00:41:18,So much for love.
676,00:41:18,00:41:21,"Well, there's still hope for the rest of us, I hope."
677,00:41:21,00:41:22,(chuckles)
678,00:41:23,00:41:25,You never did give me an answer.
679,00:41:30,00:41:32,Okay.
680,00:41:32,00:41:37,"Look, if you don't want to move in together, you know, I understand."
681,00:41:37,00:41:39,Lou.
682,00:41:42,00:41:49,I think that what we have now is pretty awesome.
683,00:41:49,00:41:50,Mm-hmm.
684,00:41:50,00:41:59,"And I just fear that if we were to move in together, we're going to start to argue about who forgot to unload the dishwasher, all kinds of crap like that."
685,00:41:59,00:42:01,"Besides, we're both armed."
686,00:42:01,00:42:02,It could end badly.
687,00:42:02,00:42:03,(chuckles)
688,00:42:03,00:42:07,"Yeah, but, uh..."
689,00:42:07,00:42:10,I'm willing to risk it.
690,00:42:12,00:42:15,I'm not.
691,00:42:17,00:42:21,Can't we just enjoy what we've got now?
